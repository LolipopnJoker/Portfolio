1
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,062
- Want toast?
- Yes.

2
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,814
Ellie, where's your cereal bowl?

3
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,816
- I'm not hungry.
- You need to eat.

4
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,736
- I'm not hungry, Mom.
- You need to eat before school.

5
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,779
- One more bite.
- You want jelly?

6
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,489
Yes, please.

7
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,659
Watch it, Brenda. Don't
mess my clothes up.

8
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,703
Billy Baker's in my class this year.

9
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,747
- Oh, did he flunk too?
- Shut up!

10
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,374
- Hey!
- You're one to talk.

11
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,377
- Are you excited about school?
- Yeah.

12
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,379
- Isn't your sister cute?
- You stink.

13
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,464
Very cute.

14
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:38,592
He stinks. He's gotta shower
before he eats with us.

15
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,844
Stop picking on your brother and eat.

16
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:45,891
May Belle?

17
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,101
- Honey, here's your juice.
- Thanks.

18
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,688
OK, who hid my sneakers?

19
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:55,234
Jess, you could hardly call them
sneakers anymore. I threw them out.

20
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:56,985
What? Mom!

21
00:03:57,028 --> 00:04:00,948
Sorry, but I will not send any child
of mine to school looking like some hobo.

22
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:04,409
There's a perfectly good old pair
of Brenda's I put out for you.

23
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,454
These are girls' ones.

24
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:10,207
It's the fan belt this
time, but I got another.

25
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,876
- Bye-bye.
- Ellie? Honey, here you go.

26
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,545
- What's the matter?
- There's a big race today.

27
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,673
- And?
- My sneakers.

28
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:20,926
- I got a perfectly good pair for him.
- These are girls' ones.

29
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,096
- I can't race in these.
- You couldn't race in your old ones.

30
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,181
He needs some new sneakers, Mary.

31
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:31,061
- Catch Billy's eye in that.
- We don't have anything for extras.

32
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:34,022
- Excuse me?
- You're excused.

33
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,817
They make them the same.
You got your chores done?

34
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,695
Just about to.

35
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:21,445
I try to keep my pit stops
under ten seconds, ace.

36
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,281
Give it to me.

37
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,742
- Give it...
- Hey, that's my lunch!

38
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,243
I found it!

39
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,707
You're kidding me.

40
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,959
OK, that's enough.

41
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:38,920
Consider it a free lunch
program, farmer boy!

42
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:40,714
All right, settle down.

43
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:42,799
Good one, Janice.

44
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,635
What do you call your teacher?
I wanna tellAlexandra.

45
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,347
- "Monster Mouth." Now scoot.
- Alexandra,

46
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:53,393
- they call her "Monster Mouth" Myers.
- I said scoot!

47
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,604
Afew ground rules for this classroom.

48
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:59,691
No talking. No chewing gum. No
electronic devices. Be forewarned.

49
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,943
If you download essays off the Internet,

50
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,946
you'll be downloaded into detention.

51
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:08,658
Let's start the year off on the right
foot and all do our own work.

52
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,661
- I expect you to take notes.
- Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep,

53
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:15,957
Beep-beep-beep-beep-beep. Know what that is?
My loser detector.

54
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,461
Jesse Aarons!

55
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,673
I got it from your sisters.
I do not need it from you.

56
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,093
- Oh, man.
- That goes for you as well.

57
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,677
He hit me.

58
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:32,015
- You're dead meat.
- Scott Hoager and Gary Fulcher,

59
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,141
be quiet!

60
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:37,562
Now, back to what we were discussing
before we were so rudely interrupted.

61
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,731
Sweet sneaks, Aarons.

62
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:43,026
You wear your sisters'
hand-me-down underwear too?

63
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:46,238
He asked you a question, twinkle toes.

64
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:53,662
Good morning, kids. Welcome back.
I hope you had a great summer.

65
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:57,457
Mrs. Myers, this is Leslie Burke,
who will bejoining your class.

66
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:01,378
- Leslie, welcome to Lark Creek.
- Thanks.

67
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:05,048
Thank you, Principal Turner.

68
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:08,260
Well, Leslie, um, you'll sit
at my desk this morning,

69
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:11,513
until we can figure out where
to squeeze you in.

70
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:18,103
I like to start the year
with a little fun.

71
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:21,773
I want you all to write a one-page
essay about your favorite hobby.

72
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,400
Yes?

73
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:27,487
Mrs. Myers, when you say one page, did
you mean both sides of the paper?

74
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,866
- You can do one side, Madison.
- I'll do two.

75
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:34,202
- Yeah, that's cool.
- No way!

76
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:37,122
- It was so amazing.
- Can I have this?

77
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:40,542
You could have two bucks out of it all.
I'm getting most of it, OK?

78
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,295
- Excuse me.
- Got a dollar?

79
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,590
- No.
- You're gonna have to use your pants.

80
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,343
- What's your problem?
- You got that backwards.

81
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:53,305
- You got the problem.
- That's right, new girl.

82
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:58,268
- Nice feet.
- You say something?

83
00:07:58,352 --> 00:07:59,811
What I said was,

84
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:03,356
have you ever heard the story
about the trolls under the bridges

85
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,859
who collect tolls from unlucky travelers?

86
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:08,028
Trolls? What is she talking about?

87
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:12,782
Nice try, beanpole. It's still a dollar.

88
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,055
Yeah!

89
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:39,434
- Let's do it. Do it.
- Yeah, we've got Hoager.

90
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,439
Next grade, line up. Let's do
this thing. Come on.

91
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,608
Fulcher, Hoager, get in here.

92
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,569
Get ready. Let's get this race started.

93
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,446
- Beep, beep, beep.
- Dead meat.

94
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:56,117
Back behind the line. You know how it goes.
Back behind. Come on.

95
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,620
Hey, new girl. This isjust for guys.

96
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,330
Hey, I'm talking to you!

97
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:03,375
What's the matter? Afraid
a girl's gonna beat you?

98
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:08,129
- On your mark. Get set.
- Dead meat.

99
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,765
Go, Hoager! Get in there!

100
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:30,068
Go! Go, Jess, go!

101
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,489
Come on!

102
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,366
Come on! You can do it!

103
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,660
Come on, Jess!

104
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,704
Go, Jess, go!

105
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,096
Jess, Jess, did you win?

106
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:04,185
Hey, Jess, right?

107
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,740
- Idiot!
- What?

108
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,244
- See you tomorrow.
- Ten seconds, ace.

109
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,419
Thank you.

110
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:33,298
Are you following me?

111
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,258
No. I live over there.

112
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,219
We're neighbors? You got little sisters?

113
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:41,181
- No. Just me.
- Oh.

114
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:43,099
You got any Barbies?

115
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:46,645
Yeah. I think I have a few. You got any?

116
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:50,815
- Yeah, I have one... and a half.
- And a half?

117
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,110
One got cut in half playing
Super Extreme Barbies.

118
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,612
Never heard of that before.

119
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,656
You flush the toilet with them in it,

120
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,450
drop them from the upstairs
window, stuff like that.

121
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,662
- It's really fun.
- Sounds like fun.

122
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:07,290
- Well, I'll see you around.
- Yeah. See ya.

123
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,667
- See ya.
- Hey, guys.

124
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:09,751
Hey, Dad.

125
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:12,796
- I'm getting supplies. You wanna come?
- Yeah. Sure.

126
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,673
See ya.

127
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,427
There we go. This'll make it feel better.

128
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,722
- How come it's my fault?
- When I ask you to watch the baby,

129
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,392
- I mean watch the baby, Brenda.
- It's Ellie's turn.

130
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:28,395
- I'm doing my algebra.
- Put more cream on there.

131
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,897
You girls have to start
helping out more here.

132
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,649
You're not little kids anymore.

133
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:45,412
May Belle! How many times have
I told you, stay out of my stuff.

134
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,539
- It wasn't me.
- It was too you.

135
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:50,333
- You can't prove it!
- There a problem here?

136
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,669
- Daddy!
- Hey, sweetie.

137
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,963
Is he picking on you?

138
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:58,842
- She was in my stuff.
- What stuff?

139
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,894
How'd that race go?

140
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,605
There's this new girl moved in next door.

141
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,900
She beat all of the boys. Even Jess.

142
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:22,240
Make sure you take
out the garbage before supper.

143
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,577
One drop.

144
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:29,080
And that's the magic. Here
comes May Belle's flowers.

145
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,709
Are these ever gonna grow?

146
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:36,212
This greenhouse is gonna be
filled with your purple flowers.

147
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:39,299
May Belle's flowers.

148
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:43,595
I always wanted the one that had,
like, purple all over it.

149
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,432
They are so cool.

150
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,976
- These things are gonna grow fast.
- Me too.

151
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,896
- Tomorrow, it's gonna be filled.
- Yeah.

152
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,191
The bell's gonna ring!

153
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:59,736
- Good morning, everybody!
- Good morning, Ms. Edmunds!

154
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,863
Aren't you glad that summer's over?

155
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:05,408
- No!
- No? I am.

156
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,660
Come and get your instruments.

157
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,579
- Can I play the woodblock?
- Yes.

158
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,125
Ms. Edmunds? May I please
play the castanets?

159
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,420
Yes, you may. Everybody ready for music?

160
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:20,673
Take a picture. Lasts longer.

161
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:24,093
It's awfully quiet. ♪ Old
McDnnald had a farm...

162
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:27,096
- No!
- No? You don't like that song?

163
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,641
- No!
- Then make some noise. Come on.

164
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,454
- We saw this video yesterday.
- Whatever.

165
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:36,249
Change it! Give it... give it to me!

166
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,626
Stop it. You're always fighting.

167
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:42,046
- Wait till I get my own place.
- I wanna watch this.

168
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:45,091
Wejust can't keep going like this.

169
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:48,511
Honey, uh... I've only got what I've got
to work with. We gotta...

170
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,139
You gotta figure out a way
to get down on this.

171
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:54,142
It's a problem, but I'm
gonna try to get going.

172
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:58,021
And maybe you can pick
up another shift at the store.

173
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,815
Dead meat.

174
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,279
Wow.

175
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:09,157
You're really good at drawing.

176
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,201
Like, better than any kid I've ever seen.

177
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,870
Uh... Thanks.

178
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,376
I wanna share this
composition for two reasons.

179
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,880
One, it uses adjectives well. And two,

180
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:28,718
it's clear the author paid attention
to what she saw and what she felt,

181
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:32,305
which is important for any writing.

182
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:37,268
Self-Contained Underwater Breathing
Apparatus by Leslie Burke.

183
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,396
Leslie, why don't you read it for us.

184
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,732
Oh, man. Can you believe this?

185
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,202
"I'm moving gently forward,

186
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:58,831
over the wild and beautiful,
unexplored world below me.

187
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,417
I'm floating in silence,

188
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,504
and breaking it
up with the sound of my breath.

189
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:08,508
Above me, there's nothing
but shimmery light,

190
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,593
the place where I've come from,

191
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,096
and will go back to when I am done here.

192
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,598
I'm diving.

193
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:18,351
I'm a scuba diver.

194
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:21,980
I'm going deeper past the wrinkled
rocks and dark seaweed

195
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:26,109
toward a deep blueness where
a school of silver fish wait.

196
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:30,113
As I swim through the water,

197
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,824
bubbles burst from me,

198
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,785
wobbling like littlejellyfish
as they rise.

199
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,829
I check my air.

200
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,873
I don't have as much time
as I need to see everything,

201
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,751
but that is what makes it so special."

202
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:48,172
Thank you, Leslie. Now tonight
at 7:00 on channel four

203
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:52,552
there is a special about an undersea
explorer, Dr. Bob Ballard.

204
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:56,973
I want everyone to watch and write
one page about what you've learned.

205
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,474
Leslie?

206
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,643
What if you can't watch this program?

207
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:04,355
Inform your parents it's an assignment,
I'm sure they won't object.

208
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,483
But... what if you don't have a TV?

209
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,743
My dad says the TV kills
your brain cells.

210
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:21,122
Your dad doesn't know anything.
We watch TV, like, every day.

211
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,416
- I rest my case.
- Well, then, Leslie,

212
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,420
you don't have to write this essay.
Pick something else to write about.

213
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:30,089
Yeah, like, how to live in a cave.

214
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,341
That's enough, Mr. Hoager.

215
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,099
Hey, Leslie, come here.

216
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:43,394
What are you gonna write your essay on?
Bats in caves?

217
00:17:57,367 --> 00:18:00,536
- Here comes Janice!
- New kid's in Janice's seat.

218
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:04,832
- What does she think she's doing?
- Jess! The big kids will kill her!

219
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,878
You have a death wish? This
row's for eighth-graders.

220
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:13,841
That's right, beanpole. Move it.
Out of my way, farm boy.

221
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,570
You're really asking for it.

222
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,740
Seems to me she gives it
out whether you ask for it or not.

223
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,992
So might as well have some fun.

224
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:43,788
Getting Janice all wound
up is a weird way of having fun.

225
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,292
Well, what's your idea of having fun?

226
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,254
- I don't know.
- Well, you wanna do something?

227
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,465
- I don't know.
- Let's do something. Definitely.

228
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,842
- What?
- You can't do it.

229
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:58,719
- Do what?
- What we're doing.

230
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:07,145
Hey, May Belle! I don't
use my Barbies anymore.

231
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:10,481
- If you want, you can have them.
- To keep for permanent?

232
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,525
- Sure.
- Thanks.

233
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,946
You're lucky to have a sister.

234
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,907
I've got four, and I'd trade
them all for a good dog.

235
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,326
I'd love to have a dog.

236
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,704
Now let's go before she changes her mind.

237
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,249
Race you to the end of the road.
On your mark, get set, go!

238
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,032
Come on, Jess!

239
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,241
Come on!

240
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,498
What about sharks?

241
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,878
You ever see any sharks while you're

242
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,130
scuba-ing or whatever?

243
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,883
I've never gone scuba
diving in my whole life.

244
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:23,804
- You lied in your essay?
- No. I made it up.

245
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:26,140
It's different from lying.

246
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,853
Those drawings you make, you
seen those things yourself?

247
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,689
No, but...

248
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,820
Hey! Look at that!

249
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,156
- Cool!
- That's been there forever.

250
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,616
I wouldn't trust it.

251
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,244
Come on. Just try it.

252
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,164
OK.

253
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,881
You got it? That's it.

254
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,884
Thanks.

255
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,431
- What are you doing?
- Getting up higher.

256
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:10,685
OK.

257
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:22,196
Wow! That was so much fun.
You have to try it. Come on.

258
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,094
OK.

259
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,905
Let your head hang back,
watch the clouds.

260
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,782
Feels like flying.

261
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:37,271
- We need a place. Just for us.
- Hmm?

262
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:40,316
Where there's no Janice
Averys or Scott Hoagers.

263
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,236
Yeah, but when we go back
to school, there they are waiting.

264
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,988
Yeah, but...

265
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:49,241
...someplace better than just
not being at school.

266
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:52,870
What if there was a magical
kingdom only we knew about?

267
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,706
I don't know. What if?

268
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,042
OK, well...

269
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:00,795
...what if the only way we could enter it

270
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:03,214
is by swinging on this enchanted rope?

271
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:06,258
- Enchanted rope?
- Yeah.

272
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,803
Come on.

273
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:18,479
Leslie!

274
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,200
Leslie.

275
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,707
- Come on!
- Wait up.

276
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:09,905
Ahh!

277
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,533
We shouldn't be in here.
This isn't our land.

278
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:15,661
- Not so loud. They'll hear you.
- What are you talking about?

279
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:24,712
Hey! What's that?

280
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,342
Whoa. Jess, look at this. Wow.

281
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:36,265
Too bad for them. They got so close.

282
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:39,518
- What are you talking about?
- To the kingdom.

283
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,440
- What's that?
- What?

284
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:47,735
That sound. I've heard it before.
Someone's out there.

285
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:50,779
That's the sound of the prisoners
rattling their chains.

286
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,491
What prisoners?

287
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,993
The prisoners of the Dark Master.

288
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:02,875
- We should go.
- Wait, Jess, look.

289
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,836
What is it?

290
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,550
Look at this.

291
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:21,644
Wow. This is amazing.

292
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,191
Wow.

293
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:39,995
This is it.

294
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,846
Warriors.

295
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:03,435
- Try dragonflies.
- No. They're warriors.

296
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,854
From the treetop provinces.

297
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:11,277
- I don't know this game.
- What game? This is for real.

298
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:17,491
This is the ruins
of a once great fortress

299
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:20,035
whose people have been imprisoned.

300
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:25,124
Jess, you and I have
been sent to free them.

301
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:30,629
Prisoners of the Dark Master, hear me!

302
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:34,049
We have come to free you.

303
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,759
Do you hear us?

304
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,803
Show me that you hear us!

305
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:49,231
You got lucky timing. The
wind's been blowing off and on all day.

306
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:55,779
Can't hear you!

307
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,609
- Go straight home. I'll see you soon.
- OK. See ya!

308
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:01,572
Hey, don't you think
we should give her a hand?

309
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,410
Uh... She's... She's fine.

310
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,413
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

311
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:11,165
...forget. There are four of us.

312
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:12,541
OK.

313
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:16,503
Remember to bring your bag.

314
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:19,047
Why would anyone want to wear that?

315
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:26,096
Janice!

316
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,806
- You OK?
- What's the problem?

317
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:30,642
- Jess Aarons tripped me.
- Uh...

318
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:32,770
On purpose.

319
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:35,439
OK, Aarons. Hit the road.

320
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:38,901
- But he didn't do anything.
- Go.

321
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:42,696
- It was definitely him.
- I know.

322
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:02,257
- What happened to you?
- Janice is a very talented person.

323
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,135
She can shoot ketchup packets
over four rows of seats.

324
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,970
Jeez.

325
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:10,432
Can I wash up at your house? My
mom sees this, she'll be all over

326
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,185
the principal and everybody,
and my life will be over.

327
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:19,274
Why would Dad do this?

328
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,276
- Oh. Hello.
- Oh.

329
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,779
Mom, this is Leslie.

330
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:25,739
- Hi, Leslie.
- Hi.

331
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:28,492
- It's nice to meet you.
- Thank you. You too.

332
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:32,246
So are you and your family
getting settled in OK?

333
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:35,707
- Yes, ma'am.
- That's nice.

334
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,418
- Come on. See ya later.
- Not too late, OK, honey?

335
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:44,174
- Weird and weirder.
- Hey. Be glad he's found a friend.

336
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:47,970
- Where's your dad work?
- At home. Same as my mom.

337
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:50,138
- They're writers.
- Writers?

338
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:53,308
- What do they write about?
- Fiction.

339
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,018
That explains you.

340
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:59,940
- What do you mean?
- Well, you like to make things up.

341
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:02,484
And that's what your parents
do for a living.

342
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:06,488
You know a lot about hardware?

343
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,490
No. Why?

344
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:12,160
Well, your dad works at a hardware store.

345
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,871
OK.

346
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:17,082
All I'm saying is that you
are who you are...

347
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,834
...not your parents.

348
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:24,882
If they work at your house, you must
get to hang out with them a lot.

349
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,428
Not really.

350
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,682
What's that?

351
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,602
- Grenade.
- There're no grenades here.

352
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,189
Come on!

353
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:48,238
- Squirrels!
- Part squirrel, part Scott Hoager.

354
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:51,366
- Squogre.
- Squogre!

355
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:54,244
The sneaky foot soldiers
of the Dark Master.

356
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:57,623
- They're attacking!
- We need ammo!

357
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:07,382
This is not good.

358
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:12,804
- See them? Up there?
- Yeah.

359
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:16,892
- Do you? Really?
- Yeah.

360
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,862

Come on. You can see the whole
kingdom from up here.

364
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:47,089
Isn't this cool? We can do anything here.

365
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,725
Look at it.

366
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:01,520
It's all ours.

367
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:05,107
From the mountains to the oceans.

368
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,654
- What am I looking for exactly?
- You'll see.

369
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:13,699
Just close your eyes...

370
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:15,534
...but keep your mind wide open.

371
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:31,466
Wow.

372
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:35,303
What do we call this place?

373
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:39,933
Terabithia.

Daddy, there's something
in the greenhouse.

386
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:44,915
That's the last thing I need,
some animal chewing it's way in here.

387
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,293
What are you going to do if you catch it?

388
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:50,670
These vegetables are our livelihood.

389
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:53,924
Can't afford to share them
with animals that get in here.

390
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:56,802
- So, you're gonna kill it?
- Have to.

391
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:03,642
Well, he's not gonna get
in here now, right, Dad?

392
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:07,395
Hope not. But if he does, you
just let me deal with it.

393
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:11,108
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

394

No, why don't you go on and do
your homework, I'll clean this mess up.

- Like it?
- Wow.

398
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,351
It must've cost a fortune.

399
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:49,104
What's it matter what it costs?

400
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,273
I don't know.

401
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:54,776
Well, I can take it back and get
a cheaper one, if you want.

No, it's a giant tree

You think that tree just
fell all by itself?

427

Come on.

weren't scaring us away,

- How big?

430
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:04,155
That's how big its feet are.

- Did you, now? Now, how'd you do that?

442
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:33,161
I took him into the forest.
He's not coming back, promise.

Did he tell you he's gonna stay
the hell out of the greenhouse?

isjust a pest that eats up our food,

00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,675
money we earn and time we don't have.

448
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,970
- OK.
- Get your head out of the clouds

449

- There is no giant troll, all right?

458
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:55,910
Well, you better not let
the Terabithians hear you.

459
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,912
They thought you were their king.

460
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:15,805
Alexandra, my daddy gave me Twinkies!

461
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:19,100
Neither one squished, 'cause
I didn't put them next to my drink.

462
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:21,019

You'rejust mad 'cause I got
some and you didn't.

464
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:26,191
Whatever. Don't cry to me
when you lose them.

465
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:27,817

Janice Avery stole my Twinkies!

00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:44,417
- I told you, keep your mouth shut.
- She's there. What are you gonna do?

469
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,669
And she makes you pay to pee!

470
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,797
It's a dollar, shorty.

471
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:53,551
But I don't have a dollar.

472
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:57,180
That's not fair, is it?
Peeing's definitely supposed to be free.

473
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:58,640
Free to pee!

474
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:01,893
Free to pee! Free to pee! Free to pee!

475
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:05,939
Let's go.

476
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,703
I want my Twinkies, Janice Avery.

477
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,705
What Twinkies, Twinkie?

478
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:27,335
You're supposed to beat her up.
You're my brother!

479
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:30,463
Do you know what would happen
if I were to pick a fight with her?

480
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:32,840
You'll get your butt kicked.

481
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:36,844
No, I'd get kicked out of school
for fighting a girl. What's that prove?

482
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:39,639
She stole my Twinkies.

483
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:42,976

We'll get her back. Won't we, Jess?

486
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:57,949
Don't let the Terabithians hear you.

501
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:21,449
What's that?

502
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:29,332
It's a giant troll.

503
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:34,921
Nice feet.

504
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:38,966

00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,346
Oh, my gosh!

506
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:52,188

- Does it have a weak spot?

509
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:03,074
I don't know!

510
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:07,912
Just making it madder!

511
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:10,248

00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,843
- Gross!
- Troll toejam.

515
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:25,012
Good boy, P.T. Good boy!

516
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:27,223
Good dog.

517
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:35,356
What's Janice's weak spot, you think?

518
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:39,569
Eighth-grade girl...

519
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:41,446
...probably eighth-grade boys.

520
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,573
Who's she got a crush on?

521
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:46,284
I don't know. Let's see...

522
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:49,871
...coolest boy in eighth
grade is probably...

523
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:51,539
...Willard Hughes.

524
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:54,041
- That's it.
- What's it?

525
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:58,379
Write, "Dear Janice..."

526
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:01,132
- You do it.
- No way.

527
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:03,718
Boys' handwriting sucks. No offense.

528
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:05,011
It's gotta be you.

529
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,098
OK.

530
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:11,142
"Dear Janice,

531
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:14,729
you're the most amazing and beautiful
person I've ever known."

532
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:18,649
- How do I know which desk is hers?
- It's got dried-up blood and old bones.

533
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:26,491
"I do not know ifyou know this
about me, but I need to tell you,

534
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:29,952
I think you are so cool.

535
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:33,915
You are the coolest over all the other
girls in our school."

536
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,500
OK. Write this,

537
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:39,212
"Let's find out ifwhat
I think we have is real."

538
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:45,301
- Oh, Mr. Bailey...
- Huh?

539
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:48,846
- ...I was looking for you.
- Me? Why?

540
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:52,141
I think someone threw
up in the girls' room.

541
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:54,435
All right, I'll take a look.

542
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:03,236
"Meet me by the bus after school today.

543
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:06,572
We can ride home together
and talk about us."

544
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,993
Underline and capitalize the "us."

545
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:13,246
"All my love, Willard."

546
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:19,585
You know, if we get caught,
they're both gonna kill us.

547
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:32,139
- I got your note.
- What are you talking about?

548
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:33,766
That was really sweet.

549
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:36,227
- I'm saving these seats.
- For who?

550
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:39,063
Willard Hughes is gonna
ride Janice home today.

551
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:41,983
- What are you talking about?
- Willard and Janice.

552
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:44,151
They're totally in love.

553
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:47,488
In your dreams. Well, you
better tell Willard that.

554
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:49,949
It looks like he's heading
home in his own bus.

555
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:01,335
Look at Janice!

556
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:07,884
Hey, Janice, what happened?

557
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:10,261
Didn'tWillard know he's in love with you?

558
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:15,558
Where's your boyfriend, Janice?

559
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:27,194
- Whatjust happened?
- Hejust walked away.

560
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,120
- Yes.
- You wanna go?

561
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:38,122
- Yeah.
- I wanna come.

562
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:41,792
- You can't.
- It's a free country!

563
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:45,171
Don't follow us, or I'll tell
Alexandra you still suck your thumb

564
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:47,173
and sleep with Mr. Blanky.

565
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:53,638
- So, what do you say?
- They must have finished their book.

566
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:56,015
- How do you know?
- Hey, Leslie.

567
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:58,684
- We need your help.
- Come on.

568
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:06,233
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, Leslie, come on.

569
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:08,527
All right, let's go. We're on a mission.

570
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,905
Hey, this is my friend, Jess.
Can he help?

571
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:13,991
So, you're the infamous Jess.
Hi, I'm Judy.

572
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:16,786
Leslie tells me you're
good with a paint brush.

573
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,537
Grab one and get going.

574
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:21,540
Come on! I am determined
to have this wall finished

575
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:25,169
so when the late sun hits it,
we can watch it catch fire.

576
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:33,594
Now, that's one steady hand, Jess.
That's an artist's hand. Am I right?

577
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:36,597
Yeah.

578
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:39,183
You know, the best prize
that life offers,

579
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:42,019
is the chance to work
hard at work worth doing.

580
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:44,146
Teddy Roosevelt said that, not me.

581
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:25,896
- Wow.
- What did I tell you? Was it worth it?

582
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:55,634
Hey, guys.

583
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:58,179
Jess, get started on your homework, OK?

584
00:50:58,263 --> 00:51:00,890
I'm managing the store
on weekends, starting soon,

585
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:03,726
I need you to pick
up on some chores around here.

586
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:06,395
You know, the best prize
that life can offer

587
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,356
is working hard at work worth doing.

588
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:25,372
Hey...

589
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:30,044
...have you taken art classes?

590
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:33,506
No, I... I just made them up myself.

591
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:35,382
You're really talented.

592
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:42,056
Jess, don't let those other
kids get in your way.

593
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:47,603
- Oh, here you go.
- Thank you.

594
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:53,943
I just went to use the girl's room.

595
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:56,320
Someone's in a stall,
crying their eyes out,

596
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:58,572
and I think it's Janice Avery.

597
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,574
It can't be the trick we played, can it?

598
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:02,493
No way. But come here.

599
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:08,582
Free to pee!

600
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:10,835
Get out of here!

601
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:14,380
Get out of here, now!

602
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:19,218
- You should go talk to her.
- You kidding?

603
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:22,638
It's not "skinned knee crying,"
it's something serious.

604
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:25,099
It's the girls' bathroom,
I can't go in there.

605
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:28,227
- I don't wanna go in there alone.
- What's the matter?

606
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:32,273
Agirl who can stand up to a giant troll
is afraid of some dumb eighth grader?

607
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:06,849
Sorry.

608
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:10,227
- Go on, tell me.
- No, I don't wanna tell you.

609
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:12,813
- Why not?
- I'll tell you there.

610
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:20,696
He, like, came up to me. I'm
pretty sure he likes me.

611
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:30,831
No way! I like Tony!

612
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:37,421
Her dad gets really mad at her.

613
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:41,300
So? My dad gets mad at me...
pretty much all the time.

614
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:43,636
- He hits her.
- Oh.

615
00:53:43,678 --> 00:53:47,681
Some neighbor heard them yelling
so loud, they called the police.

616
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:51,894
And it got out. And all the seventh
and the eighth graders know about it.

617
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:57,149
- Whoa.
- Which explains, like, a lot.

618
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:02,446
Well, what did you say to her?

619
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:06,033
Well, I told her about not having a TV

620
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:08,035
and everyone laughing at me.

621
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:11,080
I know what it's like to have
everyone think I was weird.

622
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:13,165
Then what'd she say?

623
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:15,376
She asked me for advice.

624
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:18,462
Janice Avery asked you for advice?

625
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:20,923
- Yeah.
- And?

626
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:23,384
Well, I told her just to pretend

627
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:26,595
that she had no idea
what anyone was talking about,

628
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:31,475
and in a few weeks' time, everybody
wouldjust forget about it.

629
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:33,435
Man...

630
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,145
Then I gave her a piece of gum.

631
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:38,565
- We should go.
- Yeah.

632
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:42,778
- Wanna come back tomorrow?
- Can't. I got chores.

633
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:45,656
- How about the next day?
- Sunday we go to church.

634
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:47,783
- Can I come?
- You'd hate it.

635
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:51,412
- No, I think it'd be cool.
- Uh, girls can't wear pants.

636
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:55,833
- I've got dresses, Jess.
- You in a dress? That'd be a sight!

637
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:57,543
See ya!

638
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:51,972
That's what we need. Bells...
in Terabithia.

639
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:58,896
I'm really glad I came.

640
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:01,857
That whole Jesus thing,
it's really interesting.

641
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:04,318
It's not interesting. It's scary!

642
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:06,779
It's nailing holes through your hands.

643
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:10,532
It's 'cause we're all vile sinners.
God made Jesus die.

644
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:13,494
- You really think that's true?
- It's in the Bible.

645
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:16,121
You have to believe it, and you hate it.

646
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:19,917
I don't have to believe it,
and I think it's beautiful.

647
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:22,836
- You gotta believe the Bible, Leslie.
- Why?

648
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:25,631
'Cause if you don't believe in the Bible,

649
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:27,841
God will damn you to hell when you die.

650
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:30,135
Wow, May Belle. Where'd you hear that?

651
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:32,012
That's right, huh, Jess?

652
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:36,266
God damns you to hell if you
don't believe in the Bible.

653
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,811
- I think so.
- Well, I don't think so.

654
00:56:38,853 --> 00:56:42,689
I seriously do not think God goes
around damning people to hell.

655
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:45,442
He's too busy running all this.

656
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:54,368
Hey, Jess. Give me a hand.

657
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:58,914
Yeah. I'm coming.

658
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:01,792
Get my drill out of the greenhouse.

659
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:22,396
You haven't managed to kill those yet?

660
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,189
Not funny.

661
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:25,441
Look.

662
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:28,193
Ever thought of putting them in the sun?

663
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:45,294
Jess. Jess.

664
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:48,630
- Where are my keys?
- What?

665
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:51,633
My keys. You never gave them back to me.

666
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:01,477
- Think!
- I put the drill down here.

667
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:04,771
Damn it, the keys to the store
are on it, the register, all of it.

668
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:07,858
They have to replace those
locks, $700 out of my paycheck.

669
00:58:07,942 --> 00:58:09,485
They gotta be right here.

670
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:12,821
- If I don't have those keys...
- I'll find them, Dad. I promise.

671
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:16,116
Why don't you draw me some money
to pay for it? How about that?

672
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:18,410
Make yourself useful, draw me some money.

673
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:19,912
I said I'll find them.

674
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:28,295
You look awful. What's the matter?

675
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:30,297
I lost the keys where my dad works,

676
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:33,133
and now he has to get new
keys made, and locks.

677
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:34,843
May Belle?

678
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:37,304
Please don't anyone get mad at me.

679
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:39,765
- What?
- He...

680
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:43,060
- I know where your dad's keys are.
- You do?

681
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:46,480
You know the bells
we talked about making?

682
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:49,900
Well, it was meant to be a surprise.

683
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:51,902
All that clanking metal andjunk.

684
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:54,655
And... May Belle wanted to help.

685
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:56,240
And you let her?

686
00:58:57,784 --> 00:59:00,244
Why did you tell me you
found them on the ground?

687
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:02,871
- They were.
- On the ground in the greenhouse.

688
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:05,415
What's the matter with you?
Dad wants to kill me.

689
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,085
I was waiting for the right time.

690
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:12,548
So you know where the keys are?

691
00:59:23,142 --> 00:59:24,434
See ya later.

692
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:30,357
- Tell Mom I'll be home in a bit.
- Are you gonna tell Dad it was me?

693
00:59:30,441 --> 00:59:33,819
Don't worry. It's my job to get
Dad's keys back. See you later.

694
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:43,120
Whoa.

695
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:46,373
Look how high it got. Come on. Let's go.

696
00:59:51,212 --> 00:59:54,423
"Get your head out of the clouds, boy.
Draw me some money.

697
00:59:54,507 --> 00:59:58,051
- Make yourself useful, draw me money."
- What are you going on about?

698
00:59:58,136 --> 01:00:01,221
"This isn't one of your cartoons.
This is serious."

699
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:05,601
What's so great about being serious
all the time anyway? Tell me that.

700
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:13,483
What if the Dark Master gets
the keys first?

701
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:16,778
I'm not scared of any Dark Master,
and those are my dad's keys.

702
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:32,711
Leslie, get behind me.

703
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:37,174
Jess, turn around. There's more.

704
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:39,885
Here, take this.

705
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,474
Jess!

706
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:56,818
P.T., get him!

707
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:06,620
Good boy, P.T.

708
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:20,550
Yeah!

709
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:23,929
- Dead meat! Dead meat! Dead meat!
- Whoa!

710
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:27,891
Run!

711
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:30,560
Come on! Faster!

712
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:37,025
Dead meat! Dead meat!

713
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:44,408
Told you they were grenades.

714
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:53,875
Jess!

715
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,669
I got you, Leslie!

716
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:57,796
I got you!

717
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:01,258
Up ahead! Get ready!

718
01:02:06,347 --> 01:02:10,183
- They'll catch us.
- We're the fastest in Terabithia.

719
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:21,820
He's watching us.

720
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:27,200
Where are the keys?

721
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:29,536
Here, open this.

722
01:02:42,216 --> 01:02:44,843
Where are Terabithian
warriors when you need them?

723
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:46,762
I don't know.

724
01:02:50,391 --> 01:02:52,517
Great. Now there's three of us.

725
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,027
- Wow.
- Now we're even.

726
01:03:02,069 --> 01:03:03,528
Attack!

727
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:16,958
Dead meat! Dead meat! Dead meat!
Dead meat! Dead meat!

728
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:19,461
Come on.

729
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:23,590
- Come on, P.T.
- Dead meat!

730
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:48,782
Be careful! You're almost there.

731
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,375
Jess!

732
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:00,168
Jess!

733
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:19,646
Hey.

734
01:05:09,655 --> 01:05:11,698
- See ya!
- Yeah, see ya.

735
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:04,876
Jess! I called you three times.

736
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:06,169
It's your girlfriend.

737
01:06:06,253 --> 01:06:08,338
She's not my girlfriend.

738
01:06:09,423 --> 01:06:11,549
- Hey.
- Hello, Jess.

739
01:06:11,592 --> 01:06:13,635
Wait. Who is this?

740
01:06:13,719 --> 01:06:16,346
It's Saturday,
but it's your teacher, Ms. Edmunds.

741
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:20,809
I was planning on taking my nephews
into the city to the museum,

742
01:06:20,893 --> 01:06:24,771
and my sister changed her plans
last minute, so I had a thought.

743
01:06:29,276 --> 01:06:32,070
- Hey, Mom.
- Hmm? Is it the baby?

744
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:34,864
No, she's fine. May Belle's got her.

745
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:38,451
Teacher wants me to go
on a field trip today.

746
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:41,329
- Is that OK?
- Mmm.

747
01:06:45,626 --> 01:06:47,502
Ms. Edmunds? Yeah, I can go.

748
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:57,554
- All set?
- Yeah.

749
01:06:57,638 --> 01:06:59,014
- Yeah?
- Yes, ma'am.

750
01:07:06,313 --> 01:07:08,231
Forget something?

751
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:12,527
No. I'm good.

752
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:50,440
Wow.

753
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:57,447
Honey, honey, stay here.

754
01:08:00,701 --> 01:08:03,244
- Do you like it?
- Yeah.

755
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:06,414
It's Brueghel. It's one of my favorites.

756
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:09,876
I wonder if he started in notebooks like you.
I know da Vinci did.

757
01:08:14,673 --> 01:08:17,759
It's amazing how much
detail's put into it.

758
01:08:17,843 --> 01:08:20,178
You've been to a museum before, right?

759
01:08:20,221 --> 01:08:23,681
- No, it's my first time.
- Really?

760
01:08:23,724 --> 01:08:26,476
- Yup.
- Well, then I'm honored.

761
01:09:06,058 --> 01:09:07,892
It's such a nice day out.

762
01:09:07,935 --> 01:09:12,272
It's been raining so much, I began
to think it was like that Japanese myth

763
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:16,317
where the sun goes into the cave
and vows never to come out.

764
01:09:16,402 --> 01:09:19,612
- You know about everything.
- Not by a long shot.

765
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:21,739
But I do try to keep an open mind,

766
01:09:21,782 --> 01:09:24,409
and you'd be surprised
what finds its way in there.

767
01:09:24,451 --> 01:09:28,121
That's what Leslie Burke says. She
told me to keep my mind wide open.

768
01:09:28,205 --> 01:09:29,873
Leslie Burke is right.

769
01:09:29,957 --> 01:09:33,626
Mind like yours wide open, you
could create a whole new world.

770
01:09:41,468 --> 01:09:45,346
- Thank you very much.
- You're very welcome.

771
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:49,058
- Maybe we could do this again sometime.
- Absolutely.

772
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:56,316
- Hey, guys.
- See? I told you.

773
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,484
Oh, my God, Jess!

774
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:03,406
- Where in God's name have you been?
- Where have you been?

775
01:10:04,575 --> 01:10:06,910
Mom...

776
01:10:06,994 --> 01:10:09,495
I asked you. It wasn't like I...

777
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:12,248
- They thought you were dead.
- Brenda, hush.

778
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:14,125
Dead?

779
01:10:15,336 --> 01:10:17,086
What's going on?

780
01:10:23,844 --> 01:10:26,262
Your friend Leslie's dead.

781
01:10:28,098 --> 01:10:29,933
She drowned in a creek this morning.

782
01:10:30,017 --> 01:10:33,645
Apparently she tried to swing
across on a rope and it broke.

783
01:10:33,687 --> 01:10:35,939
They think she hit her head.

784
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:41,236
No... No, it's not that kind of rope.

785
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:44,948
It couldn't break. It... wouldn't have.

786
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:47,033
But it did.

787
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:53,957
- I'm sorry, son.
- No, you're lying.

788
01:10:54,875 --> 01:10:58,878
- She's not even dead. You're lying!
- Jess!

789
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:36,476
Hi, honey. You want some breakfast?

790
01:12:36,518 --> 01:12:39,312
I... I gotta do my chores first.

791
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:42,148
Your dad's doing everything today.
You just sit down.

792
01:12:58,165 --> 01:12:59,916
Jess, your father and I thought

793
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,668
we'd go to the Burkes today
and pay our respects.

794
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:05,046
Just the three of us.

795
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:07,507
Paying what?

796
01:13:28,987 --> 01:13:30,738
Prince Terrien. Shh.

797
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:33,574
You must be Jess.

798
01:13:42,793 --> 01:13:47,547
I'm Mr. Aarons. This is my wife, Mary.
Very sorry about your loss.

799
01:13:47,589 --> 01:13:50,133
- I'm so sorry.
- Hi, Jess.

800
01:13:58,142 --> 01:14:00,143
She loved you, you know.

801
01:14:01,145 --> 01:14:02,645
You know, Leslie,

802
01:14:02,729 --> 01:14:06,691
she never had much luck making
friends at her old school.

803
01:14:06,733 --> 01:14:10,069
We were hoping that when
we moved out here she would...

804
01:14:14,324 --> 01:14:16,742
She said if it wasn't for you...

805
01:14:19,163 --> 01:14:21,414
You're the best friend she's ever had.

806
01:14:21,498 --> 01:14:23,458
I wanna thank you for that.

807
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:27,044
You're welcome.

808
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:33,134
My wife and I were wondering
about the service.

809
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:40,266
We've decided to bring Leslie
back home until the service.

810
01:14:46,023 --> 01:14:50,026
- Jess.
- Next time,

811
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:53,112
we should invite Leslie to go.

812
01:14:54,948 --> 01:14:57,158
She'd like that.

813
01:15:06,627 --> 01:15:08,169
Hey, kid.

814
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:11,797
Sorry about your friend.

815
01:15:14,259 --> 01:15:18,804
The purpose of object pronouns...

816
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:21,974
So looks like you're the fastest
kid in the class now, huh?

817
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:26,479
It's ajoke, dude.

818
01:15:31,026 --> 01:15:33,069
- Are you nuts?
- Jess Aarons.

819
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:35,780
Go wait for me out in the hall.

820
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:39,659
Silent reading until I get back.

821
01:15:49,002 --> 01:15:50,753
Jess...

822
01:15:57,427 --> 01:16:00,346
When my husband died...

823
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:03,391
...people kept telling me not to cry.

824
01:16:04,518 --> 01:16:06,894
People kept trying to help me to forget.

825
01:16:10,190 --> 01:16:12,525
But I didn't wanna forget.

826
01:16:12,609 --> 01:16:14,944
Excuse me.

827
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:20,324
The things that girl came up with.

828
01:16:22,369 --> 01:16:24,954
I don't get students like her too often.

829
01:16:29,543 --> 01:16:32,003
So I realize...

830
01:16:32,045 --> 01:16:34,797
...that if it's hard for me...

831
01:16:34,881 --> 01:16:37,383
...how much harder it must be for you.

832
01:17:25,015 --> 01:17:27,183
Hurry up. We're gonna miss the bus!

833
01:17:36,568 --> 01:17:38,319
Hey.

834
01:18:25,492 --> 01:18:27,576
Leslie?!

835
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:54,437
Jess!

836
01:18:54,521 --> 01:18:56,021
Leslie!

837
01:18:56,106 --> 01:18:59,525
- Jess!
- Leslie!

838
01:19:06,032 --> 01:19:07,658
Lesl...

839
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:10,703
Help me, I can't get across! Hurry!

840
01:19:11,913 --> 01:19:13,873
May Belle?

841
01:19:16,334 --> 01:19:18,544
Hold on! Don't move!

842
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:22,673
Here, grab my arm. I got
you, don't worry.

843
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:30,556
- What were you thinking?
- I was worried about you!

844
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:33,434
Well, don't be. I don't want you here!

845
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:36,854
- But I wanna come with you.
- This is our place. Go home.

846
01:19:36,897 --> 01:19:38,773
This is our place!

847
01:19:42,903 --> 01:19:44,278
I said go home!

848
01:19:59,419 --> 01:20:01,253
Honey, what's the matter?

849
01:20:02,255 --> 01:20:04,131
What's the matter?

850
01:20:04,216 --> 01:20:06,217
What's the matter, baby?

851
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:12,616
No!

852
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:15,911
Jess!

853
01:21:16,913 --> 01:21:19,665
It's OK, Jess. It's OK, son, it's OK.

854
01:21:19,749 --> 01:21:21,542
It's all gone.

855
01:21:25,005 --> 01:21:27,506
Is it like the Bible says?

856
01:21:27,549 --> 01:21:29,466
Is she going to hell?

857
01:21:30,176 --> 01:21:31,969
I don't know everything about God,

858
01:21:32,012 --> 01:21:34,889
but I do know He's not gonna
send that little girl to hell.

859
01:21:34,973 --> 01:21:38,350
Then I'm going to hell
because it's all my fault.

860
01:21:38,393 --> 01:21:42,104
Don't you think that even for a minute.

861
01:21:42,188 --> 01:21:44,815
But it is.

862
01:21:44,858 --> 01:21:49,111
I didn't invite her to go
to the museum with me.

863
01:21:49,195 --> 01:21:52,531
I didn't wanna invite her.

864
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:55,868
I wasn't there to go with her.

865
01:21:55,952 --> 01:21:59,079
- It's my fault.
- No, no, no, no.

866
01:21:59,164 --> 01:22:01,332
It's not your fault.

867
01:22:01,374 --> 01:22:04,043
None of that makes it so.

868
01:22:04,085 --> 01:22:06,295
It's a terrible thing.

869
01:22:06,379 --> 01:22:11,008
It doesn't make any sense,
but it's not your fault, Jess.

870
01:22:16,056 --> 01:22:19,725
She brought you something special
when she came here, didn't she?

871
01:22:22,896 --> 01:22:25,272
That's what you hold on to.

872
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,861
That's how you keep her alive.

873
01:22:51,091 --> 01:22:52,424
May Belle?

874
01:23:01,184 --> 01:23:02,559
Look.

875
01:23:04,354 --> 01:23:06,230
I'm sorry I pushed you.

876
01:23:08,441 --> 01:23:11,694
That was stupid and wrong...

877
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:15,906
...and I really miss you talking to me.

878
01:23:56,322 --> 01:23:58,741
She's in your hands now.

879
01:24:22,015 --> 01:24:23,140
Hey!

880
01:24:24,976 --> 01:24:29,354
Wait!

881
01:24:31,649 --> 01:24:33,025
Hey!

882
01:24:38,990 --> 01:24:42,034
Jess? I'm sorry. I didn't...
I didn't see you.

883
01:24:42,118 --> 01:24:45,871
Can I use the lumber by your house?

884
01:24:45,955 --> 01:24:47,664
Yeah, yeah. Of course.

885
01:24:47,707 --> 01:24:50,459
Anything you see, you just...

886
01:24:51,336 --> 01:24:54,713
You know, I meant to... I meant
to give you Prince Terrien,

887
01:24:54,756 --> 01:24:58,008
but I... can't seem to give him up.

888
01:24:59,844 --> 01:25:01,887
Leslie would've wanted you to have him.

889
01:25:01,971 --> 01:25:03,555
Yeah.

890
01:26:27,015 --> 01:26:30,392
We're playing. By ourselves.

891
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:35,898
OK, but I know the most incredible
place to play.

892
01:26:35,982 --> 01:26:39,026
You gotta promise you're not
gonna tell anybody about it.

893
01:26:39,110 --> 01:26:43,238
Not Brenda, not Ellie, not even Joycie.

894
01:26:43,323 --> 01:26:46,909
Tell Joycie a secret between you and me?

895
01:26:46,993 --> 01:26:48,493
She's nothing but a baby.

896
01:26:48,578 --> 01:26:51,830
You're right, and she's not
ready to be a princess yet.

897
01:26:51,915 --> 01:26:53,790
You have to train her and stuff.

898
01:26:53,833 --> 01:26:56,877
Princess? Who gets to be the princess?

899
01:27:06,679 --> 01:27:08,388
Step down.

900
01:27:11,851 --> 01:27:13,268
Watch your step.

901
01:27:20,818 --> 01:27:22,611
You're not peeking, are you?

902
01:27:24,697 --> 01:27:27,532
Step up. There you go.

903
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:36,708
All right.

904
01:27:43,174 --> 01:27:45,133
OK. Open them.

905
01:27:50,890 --> 01:27:54,977
Wow. Did you make this?

906
01:27:56,396 --> 01:27:58,105
Yep.

907
01:28:00,942 --> 01:28:02,734
Hold on a second.

908
01:28:11,411 --> 01:28:14,788
Look! They must've heard the rumor,

909
01:28:14,872 --> 01:28:19,626
that the beautiful girl arriving today
is the new future ruler ofTerabithia.

910
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:23,046
- Who heard?
- The Terabithians.

911
01:28:23,089 --> 01:28:25,382
They've been waiting.

912
01:28:25,425 --> 01:28:27,426
Where?

913
01:28:27,510 --> 01:28:30,971
- I don't see them.
- It's an ancient forest, May Belle,

914
01:28:31,055 --> 01:28:33,432
full of magical creatures
and friendly giants,

915
01:28:33,516 --> 01:28:35,809
anything you can imagine.

916
01:28:35,893 --> 01:28:37,853
But you gotta look really hard.

917
01:28:37,937 --> 01:28:40,814
But keep your mind wide open.

918
01:28:49,449 --> 01:28:51,283
So, what do you think?

919
01:28:55,705 --> 01:28:58,123
Can there be purple flowers?

920
01:29:00,251 --> 01:29:02,669
Anything you want.

921
01:29:03,629 --> 01:29:05,630
Wow.

922
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:08,342
And a castle.

923
01:29:08,426 --> 01:29:11,219
Abig one, with towers and flags.

924
01:29:11,304 --> 01:29:13,638
Of course.

925
01:29:16,434 --> 01:29:19,269
Look, Jess. It's beautiful.

926
01:29:23,149 --> 01:29:24,858
Is there a king?

927
01:29:24,942 --> 01:29:26,360
Are you the king, Jess?

928
01:29:26,444 --> 01:29:29,029
Only if you're princess.

929
01:30:14,617 --> 01:30:16,993
Terabithia.
