1
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,792
We are family

2
00:02:05,297 --> 00:02:07,959
I got all my sisters with me

3
00:02:09,301 --> 00:02:11,633
We are family

4
00:02:13,472 --> 00:02:16,134
Get up,everybody,and sing

5
00:02:17,476 --> 00:02:19,808
We are family

6
00:02:21,313 --> 00:02:24,146
I got all my sisters with me

7
00:02:25,817 --> 00:02:29,309
Agador,where is Starina?
She goes on in 5 minutes.

8
00:02:29,588 --> 00:02:32,250
Get up,everybody,and sing

9
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:37,992
Everyone can see we're together

10
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,492
As we walk on by

11
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:46,330
And we fly just like birds of a feather

12
00:02:46,671 --> 00:02:49,162
I won't tell no lie

13
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:54,673
All of the people around us they say

14
00:02:55,013 --> 00:02:57,174
Can they be that close

15
00:02:57,682 --> 00:03:00,674
Let me state for the record

16
00:03:01,686 --> 00:03:04,849
We're giving love in a family dose

17
00:03:41,393 --> 00:03:42,553
Armand.

18
00:03:42,794 --> 00:03:44,785
The Kennedys are
here again for supper.

19
00:03:44,863 --> 00:03:46,888
Third time this week.
Do we pick up their tab?

20
00:03:46,965 --> 00:03:48,023
Ted?

21
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:50,067
No,just the younger ones.

22
00:03:50,735 --> 00:03:53,397
Wish we'd get Ted.
Give them free coffee.

23
00:03:57,576 --> 00:03:59,510
Leave room for coffee.

24
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:05,405
Where's Starina?

25
00:04:05,684 --> 00:04:08,346
Agador said she'd be down in five.

26
00:04:09,754 --> 00:04:12,086
We are family

27
00:04:13,758 --> 00:04:16,420
Get up,everybody,and sing

28
00:04:17,596 --> 00:04:19,928
We are family

29
00:04:47,792 --> 00:04:51,125
Starina won't go on.
She's still in her robe.

30
00:04:51,396 --> 00:04:52,226
Damn!

31
00:04:52,464 --> 00:04:54,295
I don't know what happened.

32
00:04:54,566 --> 00:04:58,229
Go upstairs. Try to get her ready.
I'll be right up. Go!

33
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,801
She won't.

34
00:04:59,971 --> 00:05:04,067
Merde! Have Carmen get ready to do
Starina's number,just in case.

35
00:05:09,648 --> 00:05:12,481
Honey,please. You got to
get dressed for me. Please!

36
00:05:12,751 --> 00:05:13,911
No,Agador.

37
00:05:14,152 --> 00:05:18,213
Victoria Page will not dance
the Dance of the Red Shoes tonight.

38
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,621
Or any other night.

39
00:05:19,691 --> 00:05:21,852
How about just your stockings?
Okay?

40
00:05:22,093 --> 00:05:24,084
Victoria Page is dead.

41
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:26,490
Watch how nice
I'm gonna put it for you.

42
00:05:26,564 --> 00:05:28,031
You know how she died?

43
00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:31,591
Alone...
weeping for her lover.

44
00:05:32,504 --> 00:05:34,597
Darling,have you eaten?
You look haggard.

45
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:37,501
Please!
You got to help me a little.

46
00:05:37,842 --> 00:05:40,003
-What is this?
-Supplements.

47
00:05:40,278 --> 00:05:43,611
I bought them for Armand,but...

48
00:05:44,516 --> 00:05:46,347
that's all over now.

49
00:05:46,851 --> 00:05:48,182
Okay.

50
00:05:56,795 --> 00:05:57,955
Albert!

51
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:02,461
Where are you?
Albert,come on!

52
00:06:02,701 --> 00:06:04,760
-Open up,baby.
-Get out!

53
00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:07,437
-Open it,Albert!
-Go away!

54
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:10,030
I don't want him to see me.
I'm hideous!

55
00:06:16,147 --> 00:06:17,307
Fuck!

56
00:06:17,482 --> 00:06:18,972
I'm calling 911!

57
00:06:19,217 --> 00:06:20,775
Abre la puerta!

58
00:06:22,787 --> 00:06:25,779
-Open the door!
-I'm trying,but he's crazy.

59
00:06:25,857 --> 00:06:26,789
Albert!

60
00:06:29,327 --> 00:06:30,885
Are you trying to ruin me?

61
00:06:31,162 --> 00:06:33,323
Don't look at me.
I'm hideous!

62
00:06:33,565 --> 00:06:36,227
Hideous!
Fat and hideous.

63
00:06:36,568 --> 00:06:38,559
Agador,I'm in such pain.

64
00:06:38,903 --> 00:06:41,394
I know,honey.
It's gonna pass.

65
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,231
No! It will never pass.
I hate my life.

66
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:45,999
Are you crazy?

67
00:06:46,077 --> 00:06:47,806
There is a packed house
out there.

68
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:50,279
That's all I am to you--
a meal ticket.

69
00:06:50,348 --> 00:06:52,908
-I can't stand this.
-Forget about my feelings.

70
00:06:52,984 --> 00:06:56,681
Never mind about my suffering.
It's just about your show.

71
00:06:56,755 --> 00:06:59,087
Not even our show.
Your show.

72
00:06:59,424 --> 00:07:02,188
I want a palimony agreement.
Now!

73
00:07:02,427 --> 00:07:05,260
I don't have one on me now.
Is tomorrow all right?

74
00:07:05,597 --> 00:07:07,861
-Don't use that tone to me.
-What tone?

75
00:07:08,032 --> 00:07:10,398
That sarcastic,contemptuous tone
that means...

76
00:07:10,468 --> 00:07:12,459
you know everything
because you're a man...

77
00:07:12,537 --> 00:07:14,528
and I know nothing
because I'm a woman.

78
00:07:14,606 --> 00:07:17,598
-You're not a woman.
-Oh,you bastard!

79
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,201
Everybody,take it easy.

80
00:07:21,446 --> 00:07:23,607
Whatever I am,he made me.

81
00:07:23,882 --> 00:07:27,374
I was adorable once--
young and full of hope.

82
00:07:27,619 --> 00:07:31,111
Now,look at me.
I'm this short...

83
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:35,382
fat,insecure,
middle-aged thing!

84
00:07:35,627 --> 00:07:36,958
I made you short?

85
00:07:39,597 --> 00:07:42,088
What do I do?
The number is nearly over.

86
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:43,600
Do I send Carmen on?

87
00:07:44,903 --> 00:07:46,632
We have no choice.

88
00:07:46,704 --> 00:07:48,695
-Yes.
-No! Not Carmen!

89
00:07:48,773 --> 00:07:50,104
How dare you?

90
00:07:50,175 --> 00:07:51,665
-Do it!
-No! No!

91
00:07:51,743 --> 00:07:53,734
-Cyril,go.
-Please.

92
00:07:53,978 --> 00:07:57,470
I will go on.
The people have come to see Starina.

93
00:07:57,749 --> 00:08:00,650
Starina will not disappoint them,
even in this state.

94
00:08:00,752 --> 00:08:02,413
Put on the mambo number.

95
00:08:02,487 --> 00:08:05,820
Tell Beatrice and Dante to get
the staircase ready. Go!

96
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,924
-My hands are shaking.
-That's okay.

97
00:08:07,992 --> 00:08:10,426
Agador,I need some Pirin tablets.
Quickly!

98
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,486
-What are you taking?
-Nothing.

99
00:08:12,597 --> 00:08:15,760
Just one,okay?
One before the show...

100
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,332
and one after.
No more,so don't ask.

101
00:08:18,603 --> 00:08:20,434
Thank you,my darling Agador.

102
00:08:20,672 --> 00:08:23,334
I'm gonna put
this here for you.

103
00:08:24,175 --> 00:08:25,836
Breathe.
Ignore the bad things.

104
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:30,342
This room is so crowded. Can I have
a moment to myself to prepare?

105
00:08:30,682 --> 00:08:32,673
Let's leave her.
Come on.

106
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:40,380
-What are you doing?
-What?

107
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:43,120
Why are you giving him drugs?
What the hell are Pirin tablets?

108
00:08:43,194 --> 00:08:45,856
It's aspirin
with the 'a' and's' scraped off.

109
00:08:46,197 --> 00:08:48,859
-What a brilliant idea.
-I know.

110
00:08:51,703 --> 00:08:54,866
I don't believe it.
You're shaving your chest now?

111
00:08:55,206 --> 00:08:57,037
I didn't have time to wax.

112
00:08:59,377 --> 00:09:02,540
Indifference is the most awful thing
in the world.

113
00:09:03,047 --> 00:09:07,313
I've done everything I could
to make myself attractive for you.

114
00:09:07,719 --> 00:09:11,883
I've lost and gained
over a hundred pounds in the last year.

115
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:16,884
I've yo-yoed from a 16
to a 10 to a 16...

116
00:09:17,228 --> 00:09:19,560
and you've never said a word.

117
00:09:19,898 --> 00:09:24,892
Not one hint of encouragement.
Not one scrap of validation.

118
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:29,233
If not for the Pirin tablets,
I don't think I could go on.

119
00:09:29,307 --> 00:09:31,832
If you don't finish making up,
I'm going to kill myself.

120
00:09:34,012 --> 00:09:35,843
You don't love me anymore.

121
00:09:35,914 --> 00:09:37,404
Oh,shit.

122
00:09:37,482 --> 00:09:39,609
-There's a man in your life.
-What?

123
00:09:39,684 --> 00:09:41,015
I sense it.

124
00:09:41,185 --> 00:09:44,018
And I saw
a bottle of white wine...

125
00:09:44,255 --> 00:09:46,246
chilling in the refrigerator.

126
00:09:47,091 --> 00:09:48,752
I only drink red.

127
00:09:49,093 --> 00:09:50,685
And so do you.

128
00:09:55,366 --> 00:09:56,697
There's no man.

129
00:09:57,435 --> 00:10:00,199
I'm switching to white
because red has tannins.

130
00:10:00,772 --> 00:10:05,266
Now there are 150 people out there,
half of them Kennedys,waiting for you.

131
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:09,102
Waiting to applaud you.
To applaud the great Starina.

132
00:10:09,447 --> 00:10:10,778
Tannins!

133
00:10:11,449 --> 00:10:14,213
-What do you do while I'm onstage?
-Nothing. I lie here.

134
00:10:14,285 --> 00:10:19,382
Where do you go while I'm killing
myself onstage? I know that look.

135
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,952
Go ahead,hit me.
Go on.

136
00:10:22,293 --> 00:10:24,955
That's what you want to do.
Do it. Hit me.

137
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:26,960
Go on,hit me.

138
00:10:56,995 --> 00:10:57,984
Ladies and gentlemen...

139
00:10:58,496 --> 00:11:00,327
the one,the only...

140
00:11:00,999 --> 00:11:03,661
the incomparable Starina.

141
00:11:42,206 --> 00:11:46,040
Thank you
and welcome to The Birdcage.

142
00:11:46,978 --> 00:11:51,210
As you see,I've just gotten back
from safari. I picked up a new muff.

143
00:11:53,885 --> 00:11:55,978
Look,it comes with accessories.

144
00:11:57,221 --> 00:12:00,554
Don't look at me like that.
I didn't kill him.

145
00:12:00,825 --> 00:12:02,725
He died and left me everything.

146
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:09,632
Where are the adorable couple
celebrating their anniversary?

147
00:12:10,234 --> 00:12:12,566
Mon congrats,you sweeties.

148
00:12:13,738 --> 00:12:18,402
I may have something
to celebrate myself very soon.

149
00:12:18,676 --> 00:12:21,509
I think I have found the one.

150
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,140
Yes.

151
00:12:25,917 --> 00:12:28,750
You know I hate to brag,but...

152
00:12:29,087 --> 00:12:32,079
I know this grocery clerk

153
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,922
Unprepossessing

154
00:12:35,927 --> 00:12:38,589
Some think the boy's a jerk

155
00:12:59,117 --> 00:13:00,448
Excuse me.

156
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,281
Hello.
What do you think?

157
00:13:04,622 --> 00:13:06,613
You look like Lucy's stunt double.

158
00:13:06,891 --> 00:13:09,951
I'm a combination
of Lucy and Ricky.

159
00:13:10,228 --> 00:13:14,597
And it's terrifying. Get out
the white wine and an ice bucket...

160
00:13:14,665 --> 00:13:17,065
chill two glasses
and take the night off.

161
00:13:17,135 --> 00:13:20,298
Why do you talk to me
like I'm your servant?

162
00:13:20,571 --> 00:13:22,732
Because you're
our faithful houseman. Go!

163
00:13:22,974 --> 00:13:25,636
My father was the shaman
of his tribe. Okay?

164
00:13:25,977 --> 00:13:28,309
My mother was
the high priestess.

165
00:13:28,513 --> 00:13:30,674
Then why the hell did
they move to New Jersey?

166
00:13:30,748 --> 00:13:34,514
I don't know. They were stupid.
They want me to have a career.

167
00:13:34,585 --> 00:13:39,249
Hello? A career? When will you
let me audition for you again?

168
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:43,586
When you have talent. Take that wig off,
or I'll tell Albert you wore it.

169
00:13:43,995 --> 00:13:48,159
You do that,I'll tell him you're
seeing someone while he's onstage.

170
00:13:48,933 --> 00:13:51,333
I have two words for you:
green card.

171
00:13:51,836 --> 00:13:54,600
Now go! And leave
the front door unlocked.

172
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:57,330
You're such a beast to everybody.

173
00:13:58,509 --> 00:13:59,999
Come on,Gloria.

174
00:14:44,722 --> 00:14:46,053
You keep getting better looking.

175
00:14:46,324 --> 00:14:48,815
Thank you.
So do you.

176
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,051
Oh,no. Really?

177
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,391
I feel bloated.

178
00:14:56,734 --> 00:14:58,565
-You think I look good?
-You look great.

179
00:14:58,836 --> 00:15:00,167
That's very sweet.

180
00:15:03,407 --> 00:15:05,238
I'm glad you cut your hair.

181
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,740
-Did you eat?
-Yes.

182
00:15:10,014 --> 00:15:11,003
Something to drink?

183
00:15:11,249 --> 00:15:15,083
-Beer,if you have it.
-I do not. Talk about bloat.

184
00:15:16,087 --> 00:15:17,247
White wine.

185
00:15:17,588 --> 00:15:18,577
Swell.

186
00:15:19,924 --> 00:15:22,518
-How long has Albert been on?
-He just went on.

187
00:15:24,428 --> 00:15:26,419
I gave Agador the night off.

188
00:15:29,433 --> 00:15:30,764
So we're all alone.

189
00:15:31,435 --> 00:15:32,925
As requested.

190
00:15:34,605 --> 00:15:36,266
Since when do you like beer?

191
00:15:38,609 --> 00:15:40,440
I have something to tell you.

192
00:15:40,778 --> 00:15:43,611
But I don't want you to get
how you get.

193
00:15:44,782 --> 00:15:45,714
Oh,God.

194
00:15:47,885 --> 00:15:49,546
I'm getting married.

195
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:56,453
I didn't want to tell you
over the phone.

196
00:15:57,461 --> 00:15:59,793
It's a girl.
I met her at school.

197
00:16:00,131 --> 00:16:03,464
It's wonderful...
Are you upset?

198
00:16:03,801 --> 00:16:05,462
Let me tell you why.

199
00:16:06,637 --> 00:16:08,628
First,you're only twenty.

200
00:16:08,973 --> 00:16:10,964
Pop,I know,I'm young.

201
00:16:11,309 --> 00:16:16,144
But you've always said I was
a very levelheaded guy. And I am.

202
00:16:16,414 --> 00:16:21,078
I have job offers. I know what I want.
And I have an incredible role model.

203
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:22,650
-Oh,please.
-It's true.

204
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,480
I'm the only guy I know
who isn't from a broken home.

205
00:16:25,756 --> 00:16:27,815
Stop flattering me.
It's cheap.

206
00:16:33,097 --> 00:16:34,428
Is it all right,Dad?

207
00:16:34,732 --> 00:16:36,393
Does it matter?

208
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,090
Of course it does.

209
00:16:38,336 --> 00:16:41,828
Say it's okay,before Albert arrives
and starts screaming.

210
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,168
I can't.
And I won't.

211
00:16:45,276 --> 00:16:46,937
This is too crazy.

212
00:16:47,178 --> 00:16:50,511
You do this,you're on your own.
Got that,sport?

213
00:16:50,848 --> 00:16:53,612
Don't come back.
Don't ask me for anything.

214
00:16:53,851 --> 00:16:55,512
-I want nothing to do with it.
-Okay.

215
00:16:55,786 --> 00:16:57,447
-If that's how you feel.
-I do.

216
00:16:57,688 --> 00:17:00,020
-Fine. Good-bye,Pop.
-Good-bye,Son.

217
00:17:03,861 --> 00:17:05,351
You called my bluff.

218
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:06,794
It was good.

219
00:17:06,864 --> 00:17:07,853
-Really?
-Not bad.

220
00:17:07,932 --> 00:17:09,763
I backed off a little bit.

221
00:17:10,201 --> 00:17:11,793
Tell me it's all right.

222
00:17:13,537 --> 00:17:18,372
It's all right. I always dreamed
you would. Just not so soon.

223
00:17:19,543 --> 00:17:22,205
Come on. Drop your bags.
Stay a while.

224
00:17:25,816 --> 00:17:28,216
Let's drink a toast
to this catastrophe.

225
00:17:28,886 --> 00:17:30,376
I'm kidding.

226
00:17:31,389 --> 00:17:32,720
It's all right.

227
00:17:33,391 --> 00:17:35,222
What's the young lady's name?

228
00:17:35,626 --> 00:17:36,786
Barbara.

229
00:17:36,861 --> 00:17:38,954
Are you crazy?
It's out of the question.

230
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:41,021
Married?
You're not even 18!

231
00:17:41,098 --> 00:17:43,862
Who is this boy,Barbie?
When did you last see him?

232
00:17:43,934 --> 00:17:45,424
Please,don't call me Barbie.

233
00:17:45,503 --> 00:17:48,666
This afternoon at 2:00. We've been
sleeping together for a year.

234
00:17:48,739 --> 00:17:51,572
Oh,God!
Has he been tested?

235
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:53,299
Oh,Kevin!

236
00:17:53,377 --> 00:17:54,401
Yes,and so have I.

237
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,643
This has to wait until after
the election. I can't deal with this.

238
00:18:00,251 --> 00:18:04,688
Where does the young man come from,
Barbie...ra? Who is his father?

239
00:18:05,756 --> 00:18:09,817
His father is in the arts.
He's on the Council of Cultural Arts.

240
00:18:09,894 --> 00:18:10,883
Really?

241
00:18:10,961 --> 00:18:12,656
Did they fund
the Mapplethorpe exhibit?

242
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:17,429
No! Goodness,no.
He's a cultural attach谷 to Greece.

243
00:18:17,935 --> 00:18:19,095
Really?

244
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,760
What the hell is that?

245
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,706
That's kind of a diplomatic post.
It's sort of an ambassador.

246
00:18:26,944 --> 00:18:28,605
What does the mother do?

247
00:18:29,046 --> 00:18:30,536
She's a housewife.

248
00:18:31,115 --> 00:18:33,447
That's really refreshing.
Isn't it,Kevin?

249
00:18:33,717 --> 00:18:35,878
I can't talk about this now.

250
00:18:37,955 --> 00:18:39,616
-Hello?
-You okay?

251
00:18:40,124 --> 00:18:42,615
Yes.
I just told them.

252
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,292
Me too.
And my father is...

253
00:18:45,629 --> 00:18:49,622
very excited. He's raising
his glass to toast us right now.

254
00:18:49,967 --> 00:18:53,130
I'm going to put him on.
Yes. Take it.

255
00:18:53,404 --> 00:18:56,373
-You said his parents were in Greece.
-Dad,get off the phone!

256
00:18:56,407 --> 00:18:57,567
Take it.

257
00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:00,140
Hello,Barbara.

258
00:19:00,377 --> 00:19:01,901
To your future.

259
00:19:01,979 --> 00:19:05,380
Shit! No,dear,
that was not my toast.

260
00:19:05,449 --> 00:19:07,644
I just broke my glass.
I'm sorry.

261
00:19:07,985 --> 00:19:09,145
That's okay.

262
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,480
It was nice talking to you.
We'll talk again soon.

263
00:19:12,756 --> 00:19:14,155
How dare you eavesdrop!

264
00:19:14,425 --> 00:19:16,859
You said his parents were
in Greece.

265
00:19:16,927 --> 00:19:21,762
You saw this boy at 2:00 today,
and now he's in Greece with his parents?

266
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:23,993
No.

267
00:19:26,003 --> 00:19:26,992
Greece?

268
00:19:29,006 --> 00:19:30,769
They're back for the winter.

269
00:19:30,908 --> 00:19:32,739
They're at their home
in South Beach.

270
00:19:33,144 --> 00:19:34,975
Is that like Palm Beach?

271
00:19:35,346 --> 00:19:39,510
It's close. It's about two minutes
from where Jeb Bush lives.

272
00:19:40,184 --> 00:19:41,515
Really?

273
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:00,830
Aha!

274
00:20:00,905 --> 00:20:02,702
-Wait.
-Who is he?

275
00:20:02,773 --> 00:20:05,264
Who?
Where's your little chippie?

276
00:20:05,776 --> 00:20:08,336
Will you stop screaming?
It's Val.

277
00:20:09,313 --> 00:20:10,473
Val?

278
00:20:11,282 --> 00:20:13,944
He's asleep in his room
if you don't believe me.

279
00:20:16,554 --> 00:20:18,385
Why didn't you tell me?

280
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:19,949
Surprise.

281
00:21:03,234 --> 00:21:05,065
Good morning!

282
00:21:08,672 --> 00:21:10,503
What beautiful flowers.

283
00:21:10,741 --> 00:21:12,402
Good morning,Albert.

284
00:21:15,913 --> 00:21:19,076
We have nice,fresh lobster
this morning,Albert.

285
00:21:20,584 --> 00:21:24,918
No,thank you,Mr. Lopez.
Not today. The piglet is home.

286
00:21:25,856 --> 00:21:27,187
You want the cake delivered?

287
00:21:27,358 --> 00:21:32,193
Yes,please. And remember to write
'To my Piglet,from his Auntie' on it.

288
00:21:32,263 --> 00:21:33,594
You got it.

289
00:21:33,664 --> 00:21:37,532
Thank you,Mr. Boynton.
I want to get back before he wakes up.

290
00:21:37,768 --> 00:21:39,759
I'll just try this sample.

291
00:21:40,104 --> 00:21:41,765
Chocolate schnecken.

292
00:21:45,109 --> 00:21:47,270
A triumph.
Well,bye-bye.

293
00:21:48,178 --> 00:21:51,170
Perhaps one more schnecken
for the road. Do you mind?

294
00:21:51,248 --> 00:21:53,478
When the schnecken beckons...

295
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:57,780
-Good morning.
-Not yet.

296
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,786
What is this,sludge?

297
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:06,291
Yes. I thought it would make
a nice change from coffee.

298
00:22:07,131 --> 00:22:10,123
Why didn't you say Val was coming,
you bad man?

299
00:22:10,467 --> 00:22:12,958
I would not have been
so sassy to you.

300
00:22:13,304 --> 00:22:15,295
Will you put some clothes on?

301
00:22:15,572 --> 00:22:18,063
Why don't you let me
be in the show?

302
00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:20,743
Are you afraid
of my Guatemalanness?

303
00:22:20,811 --> 00:22:22,142
Your what?

304
00:22:22,246 --> 00:22:24,646
My Guatemalanness.
My natural heat.

305
00:22:24,748 --> 00:22:27,148
You're afraid I'm too primitive,right?
To be on the stage...

306
00:22:27,217 --> 00:22:29,913
with your little,
estrogen Rockettes.

307
00:22:29,987 --> 00:22:32,319
You're right.
I'm afraid of your heat.

308
00:22:32,589 --> 00:22:33,920
Here I am.

309
00:22:34,158 --> 00:22:37,150
The bag lady.
Good morning,Agador.

310
00:22:38,062 --> 00:22:40,895
Wash those,will you?
They're delivering the rest at noon.

311
00:22:41,465 --> 00:22:43,126
Good morning.

312
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,661
My God,that beard!

313
00:22:46,003 --> 00:22:48,631
-Here you go.
-Thank you,dear.

314
00:22:52,176 --> 00:22:54,167
Turkish coffee.
Delicious.

315
00:22:54,445 --> 00:22:55,605
See?

316
00:22:55,946 --> 00:22:57,777
Is Val still asleep?

317
00:22:57,848 --> 00:23:02,182
He must be exhausted,poor baby.
You should have told me he was coming.

318
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:06,512
I'm so ashamed of how I acted.
But how could I know?

319
00:23:06,957 --> 00:23:10,120
The truth is,you can't stand
sharing your son with me.

320
00:23:10,194 --> 00:23:12,128
You're always pushing me away.

321
00:23:12,196 --> 00:23:17,190
Oh,will you look at this shirt?
It's a rag!

322
00:23:17,534 --> 00:23:21,368
No matter how many shirts I send him,
he only wears this one.

323
00:23:21,705 --> 00:23:24,196
You look awful.
What's wrong?

324
00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:25,872
Val's getting married.

325
00:23:26,043 --> 00:23:28,807
Don't be silly.
I got pork roast for dinner.

326
00:23:29,046 --> 00:23:33,039
I wanted to get filet mignon,
but it's so expensive.

327
00:23:33,884 --> 00:23:35,715
What do you mean,married?

328
00:23:35,786 --> 00:23:37,617
You know what I mean.

329
00:23:38,489 --> 00:23:40,821
-I don't understand.
-Yes,you do.

330
00:23:43,394 --> 00:23:45,555
To some girl he met at school.

331
00:23:45,896 --> 00:23:48,888
Oh,no!
Oh,but...

332
00:23:50,067 --> 00:23:53,230
he's just a baby.
He'll ruin his life!

333
00:23:53,504 --> 00:23:55,836
We've been through all that,okay?

334
00:23:56,106 --> 00:23:58,597
Bottom line is he's getting married,
no matter what we say.

335
00:23:58,675 --> 00:24:00,836
So the less said,the better.

336
00:24:00,911 --> 00:24:02,902
Oh,my God.

337
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:07,577
I woke up feeling so good.

338
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:10,750
Now,all of a sudden,I feel...

339
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:13,579
so funny.

340
00:24:14,591 --> 00:24:16,582
Let it go.
Breathe.

341
00:24:16,927 --> 00:24:18,417
Oh,you've heard.

342
00:24:18,529 --> 00:24:23,193
Oh,Vallie! Oh,my God,
this is such a shock.

343
00:24:23,434 --> 00:24:26,426
I'm not saying anything.
I promised your father.

344
00:24:27,438 --> 00:24:31,204
But at 20,if you throw yourself away
on some dormitory slut...

345
00:24:31,275 --> 00:24:33,641
you'll be sorry the rest
of your life. There!

346
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:36,178
That's all. No more.

00:24:37,281 --> 00:24:40,273
Well,don't just stand there.
Give me a kiss!

348
00:24:40,551 --> 00:24:43,884
Or are you
too grown-up for that now?

349
00:24:44,455 --> 00:24:46,446
Hello,Albie.

350
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:52,452
Our baby is going to leave us.
And we won't have any others.

351
00:24:52,729 --> 00:24:54,390
Not without a miracle.

352
00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:59,736
When I and Senator Keeley founded
the Coalition for Moral Order...

353
00:24:59,803 --> 00:25:04,137
it was to express moral,
rather than political,views.

354
00:25:04,208 --> 00:25:07,234
What Senator Jackson is trying
to say is that...

355
00:25:07,311 --> 00:25:09,245
morality is political.

356
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,142
Abortion,same-sex marriage...

357
00:25:12,483 --> 00:25:14,144
It's a wonderful show.

358
00:25:14,485 --> 00:25:16,646
It's the most intelligent show
on television.

359
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,881
...pornography would not exist...

360
00:25:18,956 --> 00:25:21,424
if politicians didn't make laws
to protect them.

361
00:25:21,825 --> 00:25:24,658
That's why both houses
are now Republican.

362
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:28,961
Bravo.
It's the perfect platform.

363
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:32,860
Yes,I'm so glad I got on
Jackson's bandwagon instead of Dole.

364
00:25:32,936 --> 00:25:34,426
Dole is just too...

365
00:25:34,505 --> 00:25:35,494
Dark.

366
00:25:35,772 --> 00:25:38,172
I was going to say liberal,
but he's dark too.

367
00:25:38,642 --> 00:25:40,303
I have to fire this woman.

368
00:25:40,511 --> 00:25:42,843
This young man
Barbie wants to marry...

369
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,011
Miss Porter,page two...

370
00:25:45,349 --> 00:25:47,943
paragraph two.
It's 'porno,' not 'pronto.'

371
00:25:48,185 --> 00:25:53,122
...I wonder if he's old money.
I mean,a cultural attach谷.

372
00:25:53,524 --> 00:25:57,517
Your campaign manager is calling.
He says he has to talk to you.

373
00:25:57,861 --> 00:25:59,192
Thank you,Bridget.

374
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,971
Hello,Ben.

375
00:26:12,543 --> 00:26:14,033
Ready for what?

376
00:26:15,546 --> 00:26:16,535
What?

377
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,211
What's wrong,Kevin?

378
00:26:18,482 --> 00:26:19,710
Jackson's dead.

379
00:26:19,983 --> 00:26:20,972
Oh,my God.

380
00:26:21,218 --> 00:26:23,880
He died in bed?
Whose bed?

381
00:26:24,555 --> 00:26:25,886
A prostitute?

382
00:26:27,057 --> 00:26:29,719
A minor?
And black?

383
00:26:30,727 --> 00:26:34,891
I don't believe this. I don't fucking
believe this! I'm ruined!

384
00:26:35,165 --> 00:26:40,000
You cannot be held responsible
for Senator Jackson's private life.

385
00:26:40,237 --> 00:26:43,900
I'm the vice president
of the Coalition for Moral Order.

386
00:26:44,174 --> 00:26:48,008
My co-founder just died in the bed
of an underage black whore!

387
00:26:48,245 --> 00:26:50,679
Wait until the media finds out!

388
00:26:50,747 --> 00:26:51,736
Bridget!

389
00:26:52,916 --> 00:26:54,577
I could really use some candy!

390
00:26:54,851 --> 00:26:56,512
You want one of these?

391
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,251
Oh,this.

392
00:27:00,257 --> 00:27:01,918
My baby.

393
00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:04,921
Why does it seem...

394
00:27:05,762 --> 00:27:08,424
so real to me...

395
00:27:13,437 --> 00:27:15,098
Albert,you're driving me crazy.

396
00:27:15,372 --> 00:27:16,771
I know,but...

397
00:27:21,111 --> 00:27:23,443
Track-and-field award.

398
00:27:25,949 --> 00:27:28,110
There's the bar mitzvah.

399
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,112
Time passes so quickly.

400
00:27:33,457 --> 00:27:38,121
Well,he looked kind of funny,
but he was smiling,so I didn't worry.

401
00:27:38,629 --> 00:27:40,460
How do they get them on so quickly?

402
00:27:40,731 --> 00:27:42,289
They pay.

403
00:27:42,966 --> 00:27:44,729
They're not mentioning you much.

404
00:27:45,902 --> 00:27:47,233
It's early.

405
00:27:47,638 --> 00:27:50,971
Senator Jackson's last words.
Tonight,on 'Inside Edition.'

406
00:27:51,475 --> 00:27:53,636
Can you get a shot of the house?

407
00:27:53,977 --> 00:27:57,640
We may not make the live shot.
If we must,I'll do a stand-up.

408
00:27:57,914 --> 00:27:59,074
'He looked kind of funny...

409
00:27:59,316 --> 00:28:01,910
but he was smiling,
so I didn't worry.'

410
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:07,154
Yeah,we got a good spot.
I don't know if he's going to--

411
00:28:07,491 --> 00:28:09,482
Why don't you set up there?

412
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:11,550
Figure you'll get part
of the house in the--

413
00:28:13,096 --> 00:28:14,654
I don't know if he'll come out.

414
00:28:19,436 --> 00:28:20,425
Where's Dad?

415
00:28:20,837 --> 00:28:25,001
He snuck out to meet with his advisors.
They refused to come here.

416
00:28:25,275 --> 00:28:28,176
I never should have let him go.
How will he get back in?

417
00:28:33,517 --> 00:28:38,113
Mom,I have something to tell you
about Val's parents.

418
00:28:38,188 --> 00:28:40,679
They can't blame us for this.

419
00:28:40,957 --> 00:28:44,688
Eli Jackson was a common redneck.
We never saw him socially.

420
00:28:44,961 --> 00:28:49,796
They can understand that,can't they?
Thank goodness they're not snobs.

421
00:28:59,976 --> 00:29:01,637
What are you doing here?

422
00:29:01,878 --> 00:29:04,813
I came through the orchard,
over the barn.

423
00:29:05,048 --> 00:29:07,482
It's so dangerous.
You could have fallen.

424
00:29:07,551 --> 00:29:12,045
I did! I'm a wreck.
This thing is all anyone can talk about.

425
00:29:12,889 --> 00:29:15,722
Kevin?
There may be a solution.

426
00:29:15,992 --> 00:29:19,325
What,death?
It didn't work for Jackson.

427
00:29:20,063 --> 00:29:23,897
What about a wedding?
A big,white wedding.

428
00:29:24,234 --> 00:29:27,067
What wedding?
Who's getting married?

429
00:29:27,404 --> 00:29:28,894
No,no!

430
00:29:29,172 --> 00:29:32,335
Why not?
It would restore your image.

431
00:29:32,576 --> 00:29:34,407
A wedding is hope.

432
00:29:34,478 --> 00:29:38,414
And a white wedding is
family and morality and tradition.

433
00:29:38,482 --> 00:29:40,780
And it would be
such a special marriage.

434
00:29:40,851 --> 00:29:45,083
The son of a cultural attach谷,
a sort of diplomat,really...

435
00:29:45,422 --> 00:29:49,586
who doesn't look down on us
because of Senator Jackson.

436
00:29:49,826 --> 00:29:51,726
Who's willing to join our family.

437
00:29:51,795 --> 00:29:54,787
There's the cover of 'People'
and 'Time' and 'Newsweek.'

438
00:29:55,265 --> 00:29:58,428
Love and optimism versus
cynicism and sex!

439
00:29:58,502 --> 00:30:00,493
It would be an affirmation!

440
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:03,403
If necessary,we'll get
the Pope's blessing. It's not hard.

441
00:30:03,473 --> 00:30:08,604
No,he's too controversial.
What about Billy Graham?

442
00:30:08,779 --> 00:30:09,973
He's too liberal.

443
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,942
-Where's the candy?
-You've had enough candy.

444
00:30:13,216 --> 00:30:15,707
This boy--
What's his father's name?

445
00:30:16,052 --> 00:30:17,383
Armand...

446
00:30:17,754 --> 00:30:18,743
Coleman.

447
00:30:19,122 --> 00:30:22,455
I wonder if they're related
to Tish and Bobo Coleman.

448
00:30:22,726 --> 00:30:25,194
-Are they from Boston?
-I don't think so.

449
00:30:25,529 --> 00:30:27,656
I think we should go
to South Beach immediately.

450
00:30:27,731 --> 00:30:29,062
We should have dinner--

451
00:30:31,134 --> 00:30:33,898
We'll have dinner with them
and stay with the Bushes.

452
00:30:34,304 --> 00:30:39,298
Mr. and Mrs. Armand Coleman
of Greece and South Beach.

453
00:30:57,661 --> 00:31:01,324
What is this dream I see

454
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,663
Why does it seem so real

455
00:31:07,003 --> 00:31:08,664
To me

456
00:31:09,005 --> 00:31:13,669
What if this dream turns out to be

457
00:31:14,511 --> 00:31:17,344
More than a dream

458
00:31:17,848 --> 00:31:20,339
Fairy dust,fairy dust,fairy dust.

459
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:26,853
Come,little dream,and play

460
00:31:28,191 --> 00:31:30,352
Don't be afraid

461
00:31:30,694 --> 00:31:33,026
Don't fade away

462
00:31:33,864 --> 00:31:36,025
Quick,little dream

463
00:31:36,366 --> 00:31:38,857
Before you're gone

464
00:31:39,202 --> 00:31:41,534
Let's get it on

465
00:31:44,875 --> 00:31:46,206
I saw that.

466
00:31:46,643 --> 00:31:49,635
Well,this is impossible.
Either I'm an artist...

467
00:31:49,779 --> 00:31:53,237
or I'm just some cheap drag queen
trying to get laughs.

468
00:31:53,316 --> 00:31:54,806
Let's just get through it.

469
00:31:54,885 --> 00:31:58,150
I have to understand
every nuance of a song.

470
00:31:58,221 --> 00:32:01,213
I have to give my all.
Everyone else can just 'get through it.'

471
00:32:01,291 --> 00:32:03,088
He's chewing gum.

472
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:04,649
Chewing gum helps me think.

473
00:32:04,895 --> 00:32:06,726
You're wasting your gum.

474
00:32:06,997 --> 00:32:09,989
Let's keep going.
And no more talking. From anyone.

475
00:32:10,066 --> 00:32:11,499
-I need to talk to you.
-Sit.

476
00:32:11,735 --> 00:32:13,999
-It's important.
-Quiet. He's rehearsing.

477
00:32:18,241 --> 00:32:20,732
Each night anew

478
00:32:23,413 --> 00:32:25,745
Tell me,my dream

479
00:32:26,082 --> 00:32:28,414
Are you a dreamer too

480
00:32:28,618 --> 00:32:30,108
What is it?

481
00:32:30,186 --> 00:32:34,020
-Can you come upstairs with me?
-No,not right now.

482
00:32:36,593 --> 00:32:40,586
Did you see what he just did?
Hello,Vallie,darling.

483
00:32:41,264 --> 00:32:46,258
He blew a bubble while I was singing.
He can't do that while I'm singing!

484
00:32:46,603 --> 00:32:48,264
This may be a drag show...

485
00:32:48,605 --> 00:32:52,200
but it should be a good drag show.
If possible,a great one.

486
00:32:52,275 --> 00:32:54,140
Just because you're 22 and hung--

487
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:55,541
I'll do this,Albert.

488
00:32:55,779 --> 00:32:57,542
-You're the director.
-Thank you.

489
00:32:58,214 --> 00:33:01,206
This is a complex number,
full of mythic themes.

490
00:33:01,451 --> 00:33:04,113
The woman who is singing
invented you.

491
00:33:04,621 --> 00:33:07,283
You are her fantasy.
Suddenly,you...

492
00:33:07,557 --> 00:33:12,460
the fantasy,see her,your inventor,
and she becomes your fantasy.

493
00:33:14,397 --> 00:33:16,865
-I don't get it.
-Try more gum.

494
00:33:16,933 --> 00:33:18,298
-Albert.
-I hear you.

495
00:33:18,468 --> 00:33:20,060
Thank you.
I know you do.

496
00:33:21,304 --> 00:33:23,966
Celsius,
let's start with the premise...

497
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,732
that when you see this stunning,
smoldering creature...

498
00:33:27,978 --> 00:33:31,641
she transcends your desire to chew.
She electrifies you!

499
00:33:31,915 --> 00:33:35,248
Something starts in your pelvis
and goes to your heart...

500
00:33:35,485 --> 00:33:37,976
where it becomes
heart-slash-pelvis.

501
00:33:38,321 --> 00:33:39,982
Yes?
Coming!

502
00:33:40,323 --> 00:33:42,917
What do I do?
Stand here like an object?

503
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:45,992
You do an eclectic celebration
of the dance!

504
00:33:46,262 --> 00:33:50,494
You do Fosse,Fosse,Fosse! Or Martha
Graham,Martha Graham,Martha Graham!

505
00:33:50,767 --> 00:33:55,431
Or Twyla,Twyla,Twyla! Or Michael
Kidd,Michael Kidd,Michael Kidd!

506
00:33:55,672 --> 00:33:59,506
Or Madonna,Madonna,Madonna!
But you keep it all inside.

507
00:34:00,343 --> 00:34:04,177
Work on that. I'll be right back.
It's looking wonderful.

508
00:34:04,781 --> 00:34:06,612
Barbara's coming with her parents.

509
00:34:06,683 --> 00:34:08,674
-When?
-Tomorrow.

510
00:34:08,952 --> 00:34:10,283
That's plenty of time.

511
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,853
No,there's more.
There's a lot more.

512
00:34:17,861 --> 00:34:18,850
Wine?

513
00:34:19,129 --> 00:34:23,361
No. Let's hear it.
I have to get back to rehearsal.

514
00:34:26,703 --> 00:34:30,366
Barbara's father is a senator,
a conservative senator.

515
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:34,974
He's running for reelection.
And she told him...

516
00:34:37,714 --> 00:34:41,548
you're the cultural attach谷
to Greece,and Albert is a housewife.

517
00:34:41,851 --> 00:34:43,182
What?

518
00:34:44,554 --> 00:34:47,887
She had to. He founded
the Coalition for Moral Order.

519
00:34:48,324 --> 00:34:51,157
I don't care.
I don't want to be someone else.

520
00:34:51,394 --> 00:34:52,725
Do you want me to be?

521
00:34:52,996 --> 00:34:56,989
No,no. Of course not.
And neither does she. But...

522
00:34:58,068 --> 00:34:59,729
Dad,he's Kevin Keeley.

523
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,731
Who's Kevin Keeley?

524
00:35:02,739 --> 00:35:04,172
Do you read the newspaper?

525
00:35:04,407 --> 00:35:08,400
Of course. 'Variety,' the Arts
and Leisure section of the 'Times'...

526
00:35:08,745 --> 00:35:12,078
What don't I know?
Are you marrying some Nazi?

527
00:35:12,348 --> 00:35:16,250
No. He's conservative,
like half of America is conservative.

528
00:35:16,586 --> 00:35:18,577
And I'm marrying her,not him.

529
00:35:19,255 --> 00:35:21,189
-I need your help.
-Not for this.

530
00:35:21,424 --> 00:35:22,413
You've done it before.

531
00:35:22,759 --> 00:35:24,920
Lied about who I am?
Never.

532
00:35:25,195 --> 00:35:27,925
When I started Edison Park,
remember what you said?

533
00:35:28,765 --> 00:35:33,099
You said if Miss Donovan asked,
I should say you were a businessman.

534
00:35:34,337 --> 00:35:37,135
You were a baby,
and she was a small-minded idiot.

535
00:35:37,207 --> 00:35:38,868
I didn't want you to get hurt.

536
00:35:39,609 --> 00:35:41,600
It's different now.
You're a man.

537
00:35:42,112 --> 00:35:43,773
I can still get hurt.

538
00:35:45,381 --> 00:35:49,283
It would mean everything to me
if you would help us.

539
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:51,211
It's just for one night.

540
00:35:52,388 --> 00:35:55,551
This is insane.
What do I do,close the club...

541
00:35:55,792 --> 00:36:00,229
so I can pretend to be
a cultural attach谷? Whatever that is.

542
00:36:00,463 --> 00:36:04,456
And what about Albert? How do you
make Albert into a housewife?

543
00:36:04,801 --> 00:36:06,894
Well,you'd have to send him away.

544
00:36:07,137 --> 00:36:08,627
You try sending Albert away.

545
00:36:08,905 --> 00:36:13,740
We'd never get him past the Keeleys.
Dad,we have to get rid of a few things.

546
00:36:13,977 --> 00:36:15,808
What things?

547
00:36:16,646 --> 00:36:18,807
Well,that,for example.

548
00:36:19,149 --> 00:36:21,481
Neptune?
That's a classic.

549
00:36:21,818 --> 00:36:23,809
And this.

550
00:36:24,154 --> 00:36:25,985
The Kirby?
That's art!

551
00:36:26,322 --> 00:36:28,153
And how about that?

552
00:36:35,331 --> 00:36:36,662
That better?

553
00:36:47,343 --> 00:36:52,337
Look,it's not just one
or two things,okay? It's everything.

554
00:36:52,682 --> 00:36:56,015
We're going to have
to tone this down a little.

555
00:36:56,286 --> 00:36:59,119
Just make it a bit more
like other people's homes.

556
00:36:59,556 --> 00:37:02,047
I see.
So we need a total redecoration...

557
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:04,457
so we can be
more like other people.

558
00:37:04,527 --> 00:37:07,860
And you're going to
have to try to...

559
00:37:08,698 --> 00:37:11,861
...you know--
change your mannerisms a little.

560
00:37:12,202 --> 00:37:15,694
-What are you saying?
-Just be a little less obvious.

561
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:17,700
I'm obvious.

562
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,711
I just had the walls
sponge painted,Val.

563
00:37:35,491 --> 00:37:39,655
You better come downstairs.
She's trying to take his gum away.

564
00:37:42,065 --> 00:37:43,396
I'll be right down.

565
00:37:47,237 --> 00:37:51,230
Yes,I wear foundation.
Yes,I live with a man.

566
00:37:52,075 --> 00:37:54,066
Yes,I'm a middle-aged fag.

567
00:37:54,677 --> 00:37:58,511
But I know who I am,Val.
It took me 20 years to get here.

568
00:37:58,748 --> 00:38:01,512
I won't let some idiot senator
destroy that.

569
00:38:01,751 --> 00:38:04,845
Fuck the senator.
I don't give a damn what he thinks.

570
00:38:13,229 --> 00:38:13,263
Still outside the home of
Senator Kevin Keeley...

571
00:38:13,263 --> 00:38:15,527
Still outside the home of
Senator Kevin Keeley...

572
00:38:15,598 --> 00:38:17,930
the co-founder of
the Coalition for Moral Order...

573
00:38:18,768 --> 00:38:22,864
...waiting for Senator Jackson's
colleague,Senator Kevin Keeley.

574
00:38:22,939 --> 00:38:26,773
At this point,we don't know
if the senator is at home...

575
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:31,845
Earlier reports placed him
at the home of Senator Robert Dole.

576
00:38:32,181 --> 00:38:34,911
We're here at what
they're calling Camp Keeley...

577
00:38:34,984 --> 00:38:37,384
waiting for the senator
to put in an appearance.

578
00:38:37,453 --> 00:38:41,082
The senator was co-founder
of the Coalition for Moral Order...

579
00:38:41,157 --> 00:38:43,284
with Senator Eli Jackson.

580
00:38:43,626 --> 00:38:47,619
The senator has been besieged here,
outside his palatial estate...

581
00:38:47,864 --> 00:38:50,162
by a virtual army of media,
waiting for...

582
00:38:50,233 --> 00:38:53,202
some comment
on the unfortunate events of late.

583
00:38:59,375 --> 00:39:00,865
Where you driving him?

584
00:39:02,378 --> 00:39:04,209
South Beach,Florida.

585
00:39:09,385 --> 00:39:12,980
Folks,there have been a lot
of tasteless jokes going around...

586
00:39:13,222 --> 00:39:15,656
about the death of Senator Jackson.

587
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:17,148
And here's another one.

588
00:39:18,394 --> 00:39:22,888
Join Jay on 'The Tonight Show'
with guests Yasser Arafat and Kate Moss.

589
00:39:23,232 --> 00:39:24,722
This is unbearable.

590
00:39:35,244 --> 00:39:36,575
Kevin,no!

591
00:39:36,913 --> 00:39:40,076
I'm going down the ladder.
I can't face the press.

592
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:43,012
Have the chauffeur
pick me up by the orchard.

593
00:39:43,252 --> 00:39:45,584
No! I don't want to go
out there alone!

594
00:39:45,855 --> 00:39:49,848
Barbara will be with you.
It's not you they're after.

595
00:39:51,094 --> 00:39:52,425
Daddy!

596
00:39:53,596 --> 00:39:55,257
I'm going down the back way.

597
00:39:55,331 --> 00:39:58,926
What about your announcing
Barbara's wedding to the Coleman boy?

598
00:39:59,202 --> 00:40:02,365
Not before we meet them.
What if they change their mind?

599
00:40:02,605 --> 00:40:05,039
Let go of me.
I'll meet you in the car.

600
00:40:13,449 --> 00:40:16,111
-He's leaving his home.
-Senator Keeley!

601
00:40:16,386 --> 00:40:18,547
Senator,will this cost you votes?

602
00:40:18,788 --> 00:40:21,120
What's the future
of the Coalition?

603
00:40:23,059 --> 00:40:26,222
What about the rumors
Senator Jackson was on lithium?

604
00:40:26,963 --> 00:40:29,124
Uh,gentlemen...and ladies...

605
00:40:29,465 --> 00:40:32,400
I am,as are all my colleagues...

606
00:40:32,802 --> 00:40:37,466
Republican and Democrat,
liberal and conservative alike...

607
00:40:37,807 --> 00:40:41,299
stunned and saddened
by the circumstances surrounding...

608
00:40:41,577 --> 00:40:45,809
the death of Senator Jackson,
as well as the death itself.

609
00:40:46,649 --> 00:40:48,310
My family and I...

610
00:40:48,651 --> 00:40:53,486
are leaving town for a few days,uh,
for reasons that I cannot,uh...

611
00:40:53,823 --> 00:40:56,257
To,um,plan an event.

612
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,491
An event which...

613
00:40:58,995 --> 00:41:00,656
I cannot,uh...

614
00:41:00,997 --> 00:41:03,329
Which may perhaps heal some of the...

615
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,261
bad,uh,things,that...

616
00:41:06,502 --> 00:41:10,336
Senator Jackson's demise
has made us all...

617
00:41:10,606 --> 00:41:11,766
feel.

618
00:41:11,841 --> 00:41:14,275
Where are you going,Senator?

619
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:18,844
Where? To our farm. That's all
I'm going to say at this time.

620
00:41:19,182 --> 00:41:21,844
-Did you know the girl?
-Where is the farm?

621
00:42:15,738 --> 00:42:18,571
Agador?
Goddamn it.

622
00:42:18,908 --> 00:42:20,239
What did I do?

623
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:24,503
We're redoing the apartment
for tomorrow night. Goddamn it.

624
00:42:24,747 --> 00:42:27,580
This is for the in-laws,right?

625
00:42:27,917 --> 00:42:32,251
Right. We have to get rid
of everything that's over the top.

626
00:42:33,422 --> 00:42:35,083
That's a lot.

627
00:42:35,424 --> 00:42:38,587
You'll have to get a uniform
and dress like a butler.

628
00:42:38,928 --> 00:42:41,192
No.
I'll look like a fag.

629
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:43,591
But you'll look like
a fag in a uniform.

630
00:42:43,866 --> 00:42:45,697
'Don't ask,don't tell.'

631
00:42:45,935 --> 00:42:49,200
Start tomorrow morning.
I'll get Albert out early.

632
00:42:49,272 --> 00:42:50,933
Where will I get a uniform?

633
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:53,202
I'll say,'Albert,you must go
for a few days.'

634
00:42:53,442 --> 00:42:54,431
Ay,Dio.

635
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:56,041
It'll be hard.

636
00:42:56,212 --> 00:42:58,112
I got so much to do.

637
00:42:59,015 --> 00:43:00,175
Pop.

638
00:43:02,885 --> 00:43:04,216
Thank you.

639
00:43:04,787 --> 00:43:08,450
Do me a favor,Val.
Don't talk to me for a while.

640
00:43:22,972 --> 00:43:25,304
Kevin,please,
let's charter a plane.

641
00:43:25,575 --> 00:43:28,135
No!
We can't get out of the car.

642
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:30,701
The second we get out of the car,
we'll be spotted.

643
00:43:52,001 --> 00:43:53,662
How I love the sun.

644
00:43:54,003 --> 00:43:55,994
Yes,it's glorious,isn't it?

645
00:43:56,339 --> 00:44:01,333
You know,you could use some more sun.
Take a few days off. You look tired.

646
00:44:02,845 --> 00:44:04,176
What do you mean?

647
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:05,840
Nothing.

648
00:44:19,028 --> 00:44:21,019
Don't kill yourselves
with this thing.

649
00:44:21,097 --> 00:44:22,792
Who put 'Playboy'
in the bathroom?

650
00:44:22,865 --> 00:44:24,696
Leave it.
It's what they read.

651
00:44:25,701 --> 00:44:28,636
Don't add.
Just subtract.

652
00:44:28,871 --> 00:44:32,864
Please hurry. This place has
to look respectable by six.

653
00:44:33,209 --> 00:44:34,870
Cyril,that's too short.

654
00:44:35,144 --> 00:44:38,636
I want that nice Armani break
in the front.

655
00:44:39,215 --> 00:44:43,549
But don't just pull it. Do it
down there. I got high-waters here.

656
00:44:45,988 --> 00:44:47,319
That's it.

657
00:44:47,556 --> 00:44:51,219
-But you must have meant something.
-I meant you looked tired.

658
00:44:51,494 --> 00:44:54,657
Tired means old. 'You look tired'
means you look old.

659
00:44:54,897 --> 00:44:57,058
'You look rested'
means you had collagen.

660
00:44:57,333 --> 00:44:59,995
You look wonderful.
Let's go shopping.

661
00:45:00,236 --> 00:45:01,999
No,I want to go home.

662
00:45:02,238 --> 00:45:05,230
On a day like this?
I'll buy you anything you want.

663
00:45:05,574 --> 00:45:08,236
Anything?
I'll have to change my shoes.

664
00:45:08,511 --> 00:45:09,910
-I'll buy you some.
-I need peds.

665
00:45:10,179 --> 00:45:15,173
-I'll buy you sandals.
-What's going on? Why can't we go home?

666
00:45:15,584 --> 00:45:18,075
Nothing.
Nothing.

667
00:45:18,688 --> 00:45:20,679
Then I'll see you upstairs.

668
00:45:21,757 --> 00:45:23,088
What?

669
00:45:23,426 --> 00:45:25,417
-I hurt my thing.
-Your what?

670
00:45:25,761 --> 00:45:29,094
My ankle. I don't think
I can make it upstairs.

671
00:45:29,165 --> 00:45:31,190
Wait here.
I'll bring down some ice.

672
00:45:31,267 --> 00:45:32,393
No,no!

673
00:45:32,601 --> 00:45:34,933
Why not?
Oh,my arm!

674
00:45:35,271 --> 00:45:38,536
My arm.
I hate it when you get hysterical.

675
00:45:38,607 --> 00:45:39,938
Don't leave me!

676
00:45:43,446 --> 00:45:44,606
What is that?

677
00:45:45,448 --> 00:45:48,611
I got it from the antique store
next door. Too butch?

678
00:45:48,951 --> 00:45:51,112
Don't add.

679
00:45:51,454 --> 00:45:53,445
You're blocking my way.

680
00:45:53,789 --> 00:45:56,781
Put the moose on the patio.

681
00:45:57,293 --> 00:46:00,126
Don't be such a baby.
Be careful!

682
00:46:00,463 --> 00:46:01,452
I can't move any faster.

683
00:46:01,731 --> 00:46:03,062
Lean on me.

684
00:46:03,299 --> 00:46:04,630
I need a doctor.

685
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,232
Don't be silly.
It isn't even swollen.

686
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:09,802
We should go to the emergency room.

687
00:46:10,072 --> 00:46:14,975
You're overreacting. Don't be
such a baby. Just sit down on...

688
00:46:18,647 --> 00:46:20,137
We've been robbed.

689
00:46:20,483 --> 00:46:24,817
Albie,no.
I've just taken a few things out.

690
00:46:25,087 --> 00:46:27,248
They'll be returned
by the time you're back.

691
00:46:28,657 --> 00:46:29,988
Back?

692
00:46:31,527 --> 00:46:32,858
Where am I going?

693
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:36,161
You didn't tell him.

694
00:46:36,499 --> 00:46:39,332
What?
Tell me what?

695
00:46:41,837 --> 00:46:45,329
Val's fianc谷e is coming tonight
with her parents.

696
00:46:45,674 --> 00:46:47,665
We thought it would...

697
00:46:49,111 --> 00:46:51,272
be better if you weren't here.

698
00:47:00,356 --> 00:47:01,687
I see.

699
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:05,920
I see.

700
00:47:05,995 --> 00:47:08,190
It's just for tonight.

701
00:47:08,264 --> 00:47:10,630
I understand.
Just while people are here.

702
00:47:11,333 --> 00:47:13,164
It's all right,my darling.

703
00:47:13,369 --> 00:47:16,361
It's nothing.
It's painful...

704
00:47:17,706 --> 00:47:19,697
but it's not important.

705
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:22,800
I'm leaving.

706
00:47:22,878 --> 00:47:24,539
It's just one night,Albert.

707
00:47:25,047 --> 00:47:26,537
The monster...

708
00:47:27,883 --> 00:47:30,875
the freak is leaving.

709
00:47:32,555 --> 00:47:34,045
You're safe.

710
00:47:44,233 --> 00:47:45,723
That went well.

711
00:47:50,139 --> 00:47:51,299
Albert!

712
00:47:54,777 --> 00:47:56,267
Will you listen?

713
00:47:56,345 --> 00:48:00,679
Go away. I hate you!
I never want to see you again.

714
00:48:01,917 --> 00:48:03,748
My heart is breaking.

715
00:48:03,919 --> 00:48:06,911
Please,don't cry.
It's okay. You can stay.

716
00:48:07,256 --> 00:48:09,417
I won't stay
where I'm not wanted.

717
00:48:09,692 --> 00:48:12,855
Where I can be thrown out
on a whim without legal rights.

718
00:48:13,095 --> 00:48:14,585
I have the palimony papers.

719
00:48:14,864 --> 00:48:17,697
You're lying again.
This is too much for me.

720
00:48:17,933 --> 00:48:20,925
Too much ugliness.
Too much pain.

721
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:23,602
Feel my pulse.
Am I all right?

722
00:48:23,939 --> 00:48:28,273
My goodness,it's very fast.
Let's get you out of the sun.

723
00:48:38,621 --> 00:48:40,612
-Waiter! Water.
-Right away.

724
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:43,051
It's the end.
I know it is.

725
00:48:43,292 --> 00:48:45,283
No,it isn't.
Just breathe.

726
00:48:45,961 --> 00:48:48,122
Thank you,Rodrigo.
And the usual.

727
00:48:48,397 --> 00:48:50,126
Right away,Se防or Goldman.

728
00:48:50,466 --> 00:48:52,127
There you go.

729
00:48:52,635 --> 00:48:54,626
Thank you.
That's better.

730
00:48:57,139 --> 00:49:00,973
This is not about you.
The girl's parents are assholes.

731
00:49:01,243 --> 00:49:02,733
Val is crazy about you.

732
00:49:02,978 --> 00:49:04,969
Is he?
Oh,that helps.

733
00:49:05,314 --> 00:49:07,976
Oh,you're so sweet.

734
00:49:09,151 --> 00:49:11,142
That water is so cool.

735
00:49:11,654 --> 00:49:16,648
Maybe it is a bit much to introduce me
as his mother on the first visit.

736
00:49:17,326 --> 00:49:20,159
Could you say
I was a visiting relative?

737
00:49:20,429 --> 00:49:22,158
Val's uncle?
Uncle AI?

738
00:49:22,231 --> 00:49:24,495
What's the point?
To be Val's gay uncle?

739
00:49:24,767 --> 00:49:26,428
I could play it straight.

740
00:49:26,669 --> 00:49:29,832
Oh,please.
Look at you,at how you hold your glass.

741
00:49:30,105 --> 00:49:32,096
Look at your pinky,your posture.

742
00:49:32,341 --> 00:49:37,005
What about you? You're obviously
not a cultural... whatever it is.

743
00:49:37,346 --> 00:49:39,837
You've never been to a museum,
and you eat like a pig.

744
00:49:40,182 --> 00:49:44,949
These conservatives don't care
if you're a pig,just if you're a fag.

745
00:49:52,027 --> 00:49:56,361
Oh,fuck them.
Of course you can pass as an uncle.

746
00:49:56,699 --> 00:49:59,031
You're a great performer.
I'm a great director.

747
00:49:59,301 --> 00:50:00,962
Together we can do anything.

748
00:50:01,203 --> 00:50:02,534
Oh,Armand.
Really?

749
00:50:02,805 --> 00:50:05,467
Absolutely.
We've got five hours.

750
00:50:05,708 --> 00:50:09,041
First,get your pinky down.
It's up again.

751
00:50:09,478 --> 00:50:10,809
And your posture.

752
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:15,214
My God! Are you crazy?
What are you doing?

753
00:50:15,551 --> 00:50:16,882
Stop screaming!

754
00:50:17,219 --> 00:50:19,210
I'm teaching you to act like a man.

755
00:50:19,655 --> 00:50:21,646
All right,all right.

756
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:24,723
It's a dinner party.
Let's work with food.

757
00:50:26,061 --> 00:50:28,154
Spread some mustard on the toast.

758
00:50:30,566 --> 00:50:33,899
Don't use the spoon.
And don't dribble dots of mustard.

759
00:50:34,403 --> 00:50:36,064
You take your knife...

760
00:50:36,739 --> 00:50:40,231
and you smear.
Men smear.

761
00:50:40,576 --> 00:50:42,908
Smear. Yeah.

762
00:50:46,248 --> 00:50:51,242
Get the goddamn pinky down! Make your
fingers like iron. Stop trembling!

763
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,852
Hold the knife boldly,with strength.

764
00:50:54,089 --> 00:50:56,580
Oh,God!
I pierced the toast!

765
00:50:56,925 --> 00:51:01,419
So what? Just remember not
to go to pieces when that happens.

766
00:51:01,764 --> 00:51:03,925
React like a man,calmly.

767
00:51:04,199 --> 00:51:09,193
You say to yourself,'Albert,you
pierced the toast. So what?'

768
00:51:09,438 --> 00:51:11,770
It's not the end of your life.

769
00:51:12,107 --> 00:51:16,100
'Albert,you pierced the toast.
So what?'

770
00:51:16,712 --> 00:51:19,545
Of course.
There's no need to get hysterical.

771
00:51:19,782 --> 00:51:22,444
All I have to remember is,
I can always get more toast.

772
00:51:22,785 --> 00:51:25,276
That's the spirit.
Let's try walking.

773
00:51:25,788 --> 00:51:29,280
-Holding the sandwich?
-It doesn't matter. Just walk.

774
00:51:31,126 --> 00:51:32,457
Down!

775
00:51:55,751 --> 00:51:57,082
Too swishy?

776
00:51:59,154 --> 00:52:00,815
Let me give you an image.

777
00:52:01,156 --> 00:52:04,648
It's a clich谷,but it's an image:
John Wayne.

778
00:52:04,993 --> 00:52:07,484
Couldn't we start
with someone easier?

779
00:52:07,830 --> 00:52:09,491
Come on.
You're a big fan.

780
00:52:09,832 --> 00:52:11,766
He has a very distinctive walk.

781
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,164
Very easy to imitate.
And if anyone was a man... Now try it.

782
00:52:16,505 --> 00:52:20,168
Now just get off your horse
and head into the saloon.

783
00:52:24,179 --> 00:52:25,510
Nice touch.

784
00:52:41,196 --> 00:52:42,527
Howdy,ma'am.

785
00:52:50,472 --> 00:52:51,370
No good?

786
00:52:52,541 --> 00:52:56,807
Actually,it's perfect. I never
realized John Wayne walked like that.

787
00:53:13,996 --> 00:53:15,054
Hang on.

788
00:53:19,568 --> 00:53:21,729
This guy's a fucking maniac.

789
00:53:23,505 --> 00:53:24,995
What's in South Beach?

790
00:53:25,908 --> 00:53:29,571
Armand Goldman,
you old so-and-so.

791
00:53:29,912 --> 00:53:31,402
How about those Dolphins?

792
00:53:33,615 --> 00:53:35,014
Screaming queen?

793
00:53:35,751 --> 00:53:38,549
Stick your hand out sideways,
not palm down.

794
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:40,747
-I'm going to shake it,not kiss it.
-Right.

795
00:53:40,822 --> 00:53:42,255
And tighten your wrist.

796
00:53:42,324 --> 00:53:45,316
No,straighten it,
then tighten it.

797
00:53:46,261 --> 00:53:48,456
AI,you old so-and-so.

798
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:50,191
-I just said that.
-Now I'm saying it.

799
00:53:50,432 --> 00:53:53,094
Okay.
Straighten,tighten.

800
00:53:59,608 --> 00:54:04,272
AI,you old son of a bitch!
How do you feel about that call today?

801
00:54:04,546 --> 00:54:09,279
The Dolphins,in the fourth on their
30-yard line with only 34 seconds to go.

802
00:54:09,618 --> 00:54:12,951
How do you think I feel?
Betrayed. Bewildered.

803
00:54:13,088 --> 00:54:15,420
Wrong response?

804
00:54:16,558 --> 00:54:19,049
I'm not sure.
Take it from the top.

805
00:54:19,294 --> 00:54:20,625
This is very exciting.

806
00:54:20,896 --> 00:54:23,228
-It is,fella.
-Right on,amigo!

807
00:54:23,465 --> 00:54:25,797
-Damn straight.
-Damn straight!

808
00:54:27,302 --> 00:54:29,634
-Fuckin' a!
-Fuckin' a,right!

809
00:54:30,639 --> 00:54:32,971
Swing that by me again,
little buddy.

810
00:54:33,308 --> 00:54:34,798
I'm terribly sorry.

811
00:54:34,876 --> 00:54:36,537
Take it easy.

812
00:54:36,612 --> 00:54:38,443
You take it easy,pilgrim.

813
00:54:38,513 --> 00:54:41,573
-He bumped into me.
-Tough gazongas.

814
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:43,481
Why are you being a prick?

815
00:54:43,552 --> 00:54:45,645
Why are you being an asshole?

816
00:54:50,659 --> 00:54:52,752
Are you calling me an asshole?

817
00:54:53,495 --> 00:54:56,328
Actually,I'm talking
to the asshole behind you.

818
00:55:00,002 --> 00:55:03,165
See,the swelling's already gone down.
It's nothing.

819
00:55:03,505 --> 00:55:07,339
You were magnificent,marvelous,
very masculine.

820
00:55:07,676 --> 00:55:09,007
I'm so proud of you.

821
00:55:09,278 --> 00:55:11,610
That big gorilla looked ridiculous
when he sat on you...

822
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:15,275
and banged your head on the ground.
He didn't even know how to box.

823
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:17,841
Thank you,Vallie.
You're a dear.

824
00:55:18,854 --> 00:55:22,688
I'll get you some more ice.
Be right back,love.

825
00:55:29,698 --> 00:55:34,192
Dad,could we hire a straight maid
for tonight?

826
00:55:34,536 --> 00:55:37,027
There are no straight maids
in South Beach.

827
00:55:38,373 --> 00:55:40,534
And I have more bad news for you.

828
00:55:40,876 --> 00:55:42,639
I told Albert he could stay.

829
00:55:44,379 --> 00:55:46,370
You did what?
Why?

830
00:55:46,848 --> 00:55:49,840
Why? Because he told me
his heart was breaking...

831
00:55:49,918 --> 00:55:52,216
and he's my friend and companion.

832
00:55:52,888 --> 00:55:54,719
Who will we say he is?

833
00:55:54,790 --> 00:55:56,155
Your uncle.

834
00:55:56,391 --> 00:55:57,722
My uncle?

835
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,551
Let's just forget the whole thing.

836
00:56:00,829 --> 00:56:04,822
Don't be so negative!
Have a little hope!

837
00:56:05,067 --> 00:56:09,060
About what? Once they see you
and Albert together...

838
00:56:09,738 --> 00:56:14,072
Oh,my God. Oh,my God.
I was feeling so good,and now...

839
00:56:14,576 --> 00:56:16,237
God,what a mess.

840
00:56:16,611 --> 00:56:18,602
What we really need is a woman.

841
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:21,672
We could get away with Albert as
an uncle if we had a woman as a mother.

842
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:24,412
Ironic,isn't it?
When you need a woman...

843
00:56:26,421 --> 00:56:28,412
Why don't I ask your mother?

844
00:56:28,757 --> 00:56:31,419
My mother wouldn't do it.
Would she?

845
00:56:31,626 --> 00:56:32,957
How do we know?

846
00:56:33,028 --> 00:56:36,020
Because she hasn't seen me in 20 years.
That's a good indication.

847
00:56:36,098 --> 00:56:40,432
No,20 years ago she was a young girl--
scared,broke,but now...

848
00:56:40,702 --> 00:56:43,034
You can't be serious!

849
00:56:43,939 --> 00:56:47,932
It's very unfair of you
to try to talk Val into this. He--

850
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:49,541
She'd do it?

851
00:56:51,713 --> 00:56:53,203
My mother?

852
00:56:55,117 --> 00:56:57,779
Oh,my God.
Armand?

853
00:56:58,053 --> 00:57:01,955
I don't believe it. It's been
a hundred years. Where are you?

854
00:57:02,224 --> 00:57:04,055
I'll be there in 5 minutes.

855
00:57:04,393 --> 00:57:06,122
I can hardly wait.

856
00:57:06,461 --> 00:57:08,622
Me too.
Bye-bye.

857
00:57:10,632 --> 00:57:12,065
She's going to see me.

858
00:57:13,135 --> 00:57:15,797
Why don't I drop you off
at a caf谷?

859
00:57:16,138 --> 00:57:19,972
No,I'll come up with you.
I'm sure there's a waiting room.

860
00:57:33,588 --> 00:57:36,751
Katharine Archer,please.
It's Armand Goldman.

861
00:57:37,092 --> 00:57:38,582
Go right in.

862
00:57:45,267 --> 00:57:46,928
Just sit down.

863
00:57:47,936 --> 00:57:49,096
Excuse us.

864
00:57:54,443 --> 00:57:55,774
Army Goldman.

865
00:57:56,044 --> 00:57:58,706
Katie Archer.
Or is it Mrs. something?

866
00:57:58,947 --> 00:58:02,610
No. I'm between husbands.
Sit down.

867
00:58:04,953 --> 00:58:07,945
I've thought about you
so many times.

868
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:12,226
Whenever I saw an ad for The Birdcage.
Are you still with Albert?

869
00:58:12,461 --> 00:58:14,793
Yes,we're still together.

870
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:16,290
And you...

871
00:58:17,466 --> 00:58:18,455
you've done well.

872
00:58:18,567 --> 00:58:22,298
Because of you. The money
you gave me started this place.

873
00:58:22,370 --> 00:58:24,167
You should have
gotten stock for it.

874
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:26,400
I got Val for it.
It was a fair trade.

875
00:58:27,809 --> 00:58:28,969
Is he...?

876
00:58:30,345 --> 00:58:31,676
How is he?

877
00:58:31,913 --> 00:58:34,905
He's fine.
He wants to get married.

878
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:37,015
Married?
How old is he?

879
00:58:37,085 --> 00:58:38,245
Twenty.

880
00:58:41,490 --> 00:58:42,923
My God,twenty years.

881
00:58:43,325 --> 00:58:46,317
And today,for the first time,
he really needs you.

882
00:59:03,111 --> 00:59:04,271
Shiny.

883
00:59:08,183 --> 00:59:11,277
Imelda,cancel my appointments
for tonight.

884
00:59:17,526 --> 00:59:21,860
I normally drink vegetable juice
during business hours,but for this...

885
00:59:22,531 --> 00:59:26,865
let's drink to Senator Keeley's daughter
and our Val.

886
00:59:27,135 --> 00:59:30,036
I haven't done much for him
in the last 20 years.

887
00:59:30,305 --> 00:59:32,136
Don't worry about that.

888
00:59:32,541 --> 00:59:34,873
I'm not exactly maternal.

889
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:36,700
I am.

890
00:59:37,045 --> 00:59:39,206
I'm very maternal.

891
00:59:39,481 --> 00:59:41,642
And Albert's practically a breast.

892
00:59:50,225 --> 00:59:52,557
Do you remember
the show where we met?

893
00:59:52,894 --> 00:59:54,225
Very well.

894
00:59:54,729 --> 00:59:56,720
Love is in the air

895
00:59:57,065 --> 00:59:58,396
Different kinds

896
00:59:58,667 --> 01:00:01,659
Quite clearly
People everywhere

897
01:00:01,903 --> 01:00:03,234
Out of their minds

898
01:00:03,505 --> 01:00:05,336
Act queerly

899
01:00:06,575 --> 01:00:08,065
Wait,wait.

900
01:00:08,410 --> 01:00:11,243
Wives are at
their husbands' service

901
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:14,071
Virgins are distinctly nervous

902
01:00:14,416 --> 01:00:17,408
Virgins are distinctly nervous

903
01:00:17,752 --> 01:00:22,086
Love is going around

904
01:00:24,259 --> 01:00:25,749
Ah,for the gypsy.

905
01:00:26,094 --> 01:00:27,584
How handsome you were.

906
01:00:27,862 --> 01:00:31,593
How unavailable,
and what a body.

907
01:00:32,267 --> 01:00:33,757
You're embarrassing me.

908
01:00:34,102 --> 01:00:36,866
You were so terrified.
It was so sweet.

909
01:00:37,105 --> 01:00:41,599
I nearly died. I walk into my room,
and there's a woman in my bed!

910
01:00:41,943 --> 01:00:44,275
I paid the doorman twenty dollars.

911
01:00:44,613 --> 01:00:46,274
Twenty dollars in those days.

912
01:00:46,615 --> 01:00:47,604
Oh,God.

913
01:00:47,949 --> 01:00:49,780
I thought,'What the hell?'

914
01:00:50,452 --> 01:00:54,445
'I'll try it once and see what
those straight guys are raving about.'

915
01:00:56,291 --> 01:00:57,622
How long did we last?

916
01:00:57,892 --> 01:01:01,384
I know exactly.
From 2:30 till 3:45 a.m. Two times.

917
01:01:09,137 --> 01:01:10,468
Love is in the air

918
01:01:10,739 --> 01:01:11,728
Round and about

919
01:01:11,973 --> 01:01:14,635
This morning
Bachelors beware

920
01:01:14,976 --> 01:01:17,137
-Maidens watch out
-Fair warning

921
01:01:17,412 --> 01:01:22,076
If you stop to feel a tingle
And you like remaining single

922
01:01:22,317 --> 01:01:23,648
That's your part.

923
01:01:23,918 --> 01:01:26,318
Stay home
Don't take a breath

924
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:29,988
You could catch your death

925
01:01:30,325 --> 01:01:32,987
'Cause love is around

926
01:01:40,001 --> 01:01:41,332
Sorry.

927
01:01:43,171 --> 01:01:47,005
You're in incredible shape.
And you can still dance.

928
01:01:47,342 --> 01:01:49,503
So can you,Armand.

929
01:01:49,844 --> 01:01:51,675
Thank you.
That's so cool.

930
01:01:52,013 --> 01:01:56,347
Where did all this hair come from?
Wasn't your chest smooth?

931
01:01:56,685 --> 01:01:59,518
I shaved it for the show.
I wanted to look young.

932
01:01:59,788 --> 01:02:03,280
It's much nicer this way--
much more masculine.

933
01:02:03,525 --> 01:02:05,516
So much hair.

934
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:07,691
Let me touch it.

935
01:02:08,029 --> 01:02:09,690
What a beautiful chain.

936
01:02:10,031 --> 01:02:13,694
Look how it glitters
in that thick,black nest of hair.

937
01:02:14,035 --> 01:02:15,366
Unbutton your shirt.

938
01:02:15,637 --> 01:02:17,628
-Careful,it's silk.
-Let me touch that chest.

939
01:02:17,872 --> 01:02:20,534
-Don't snag it.
-Your beautiful,hairy chest.

940
01:02:22,310 --> 01:02:24,141
I'm sorry.
I couldn't stop him.

941
01:02:24,379 --> 01:02:25,141
Albert?

942
01:03:03,084 --> 01:03:04,415
Is Albert here?

943
01:03:04,986 --> 01:03:05,975
No.

944
01:03:06,187 --> 01:03:10,021
Great. Then he's driving back
from Miami at 20 miles an hour...

945
01:03:10,258 --> 01:03:13,694
with the parking brake on.
I had to take the fucking bus.

946
01:03:18,266 --> 01:03:19,927
Are we crucifying someone tonight?

947
01:03:20,201 --> 01:03:23,034
You like it?
I traded that stupid moose for it.

948
01:03:23,271 --> 01:03:27,037
And they threw in books.
It all goes back tomorrow.

949
01:03:27,709 --> 01:03:29,108
Is my mother coming?

950
01:03:29,611 --> 01:03:31,044
Yes,she's coming.

951
01:03:31,446 --> 01:03:33,778
Yes.
Thank you.

952
01:03:34,115 --> 01:03:35,946
There. You see?

953
01:03:36,217 --> 01:03:37,946
It all worked out.

954
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:41,555
I'm only here to get my toothbrush.
Agador...

955
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:44,224
will you?
It's in the usual place.

956
01:03:48,062 --> 01:03:50,724
I would have loved
to see your children.

957
01:03:51,232 --> 01:03:54,633
Why don't you hold the crucifix?
It's the prop for martyrs.

958
01:03:57,305 --> 01:04:01,799
Oh,yes. Another gibe,
another joke at my expense.

959
01:04:03,311 --> 01:04:05,643
You and Katharine were
probably laughing at me too.

960
01:04:06,481 --> 01:04:10,645
Well,why not?
I'm not young,I'm not new...

961
01:04:11,152 --> 01:04:13,313
and everyone laughs at me.

962
01:04:13,655 --> 01:04:16,317
I'm quite aware
of how ridiculous I am.

963
01:04:16,991 --> 01:04:20,654
The only solution is to go
where nobody is ridiculous.

964
01:04:20,929 --> 01:04:23,261
Where everyone is equal.

965
01:04:24,666 --> 01:04:25,758
Good-bye,Armand.

966
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,833
Wait,Miss Albert!
Don't forget this.

967
01:04:29,170 --> 01:04:31,832
Listen,I don't want you to go.

968
01:04:32,841 --> 01:04:35,674
My poor,devoted Agador.

969
01:04:36,010 --> 01:04:38,672
I'm leaving you my stereo...

970
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:41,171
-my red boots...
-I don't want them.

971
01:04:41,449 --> 01:04:44,111
-and my wigs.
-Which wigs?

972
01:04:44,352 --> 01:04:47,844
My best wigs.
I won't need them where I'm going.

973
01:04:49,557 --> 01:04:50,922
Okay,I'll bite.

974
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:53,750
Where are you going?

975
01:04:54,529 --> 01:04:55,860
To Los Copa.

976
01:04:56,197 --> 01:05:00,361
There isn't anything
in Los Copa but a cemetery.

977
01:05:01,703 --> 01:05:04,695
I know.
That's why I'm packing light.

978
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:06,800
I see.

979
01:05:07,141 --> 01:05:11,874
You're going to the cemetery
with your toothbrush. How Egyptian.

980
01:05:14,215 --> 01:05:15,546
Good-bye,Armand.

981
01:05:15,817 --> 01:05:18,479
Miss Albert,wait!
Don't!

982
01:05:20,555 --> 01:05:21,886
Shit!

983
01:05:22,156 --> 01:05:24,147
It'll be better without an uncle.

984
01:05:24,392 --> 01:05:27,054
What did you do to him?
He goes to a cemetery!

985
01:05:27,328 --> 01:05:28,659
-Calm down!
-Why?

986
01:05:28,897 --> 01:05:31,889
Because you have to
start cooking dinner.

987
01:05:32,233 --> 01:05:34,565
I'm going after fucking Albert.

988
01:05:40,241 --> 01:05:41,230
Can you...

989
01:05:42,243 --> 01:05:43,733
You can cook,right?

990
01:05:44,913 --> 01:05:47,404
Your father seems to think so.

991
01:06:12,774 --> 01:06:15,265
My cemetery is in Key Biscayne.

992
01:06:16,778 --> 01:06:18,769
It's one of the prettiest
in the world.

993
01:06:19,113 --> 01:06:23,777
There are lovely trees,
the sky is blue,there are birds.

994
01:06:26,287 --> 01:06:28,778
The one in Los Copa
is really shit.

995
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:34,121
What a pain in the ass you are.

996
01:06:35,964 --> 01:06:39,297
It's true. You're not young,
and you're not new...

997
01:06:39,634 --> 01:06:41,625
and you do make people laugh.

998
01:06:42,136 --> 01:06:44,969
I'm still with you
because you make me laugh.

999
01:06:45,239 --> 01:06:48,731
So now I have to sell my plot
in Key Biscayne...

1000
01:06:48,810 --> 01:06:52,041
so I can be next to you
in that shithole Los Copa...

1001
01:06:52,246 --> 01:06:54,908
so I never miss a laugh.

1002
01:07:00,154 --> 01:07:01,485
What's this?

1003
01:07:02,323 --> 01:07:03,654
Read it.

1004
01:07:07,662 --> 01:07:09,254
I don't understand.

1005
01:07:09,497 --> 01:07:13,263
It's the palimony agreement.
I told you I had it.

1006
01:07:14,335 --> 01:07:19,329
It says I have the right to give you
half of everything I own.

1007
01:07:19,674 --> 01:07:22,666
It's safer,
if something happens to one of us.

1008
01:07:23,678 --> 01:07:26,340
But who owns it now?

1009
01:07:26,681 --> 01:07:27,841
You do.

1010
01:07:35,356 --> 01:07:36,345
I don't want it.

1011
01:07:36,624 --> 01:07:38,114
Then give me half.

1012
01:07:38,359 --> 01:07:42,352
Quick,give me a pen.
I don't want all of this,Armand.

1013
01:07:43,531 --> 01:07:44,862
Sign it.

1014
01:08:01,549 --> 01:08:04,040
There. We're partners.

1015
01:08:04,385 --> 01:08:07,877
You own half my life,
and I own half of yours.

1016
01:08:08,222 --> 01:08:09,553
Half the club?

1017
01:08:09,891 --> 01:08:12,883
What does it matter?
Take it all.

1018
01:08:13,361 --> 01:08:14,851
I'm 50 years old.

1019
01:08:14,929 --> 01:08:18,592
There's only one place I call home,
and it's because you're there.

1020
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:23,894
What difference does it make if I say
you can stay,or you say I can stay?

1021
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:27,730
It's ours.

1022
01:08:44,926 --> 01:08:48,020
She's gone,Mr. Goldman.
But she always checks in.

1023
01:08:48,262 --> 01:08:49,923
Sure,I'll take a message.

1024
01:08:50,932 --> 01:08:52,422
Go ahead.

1025
01:08:53,768 --> 01:08:55,759
Don't come...

1026
01:08:56,104 --> 01:08:58,766
The Reverend AI Sharpton
said today that...

1027
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:03,602
Jackson's last words,'Your money's
on the dresser,Chocolate.' were racist.

1028
01:09:03,878 --> 01:09:06,870
The prostitute's given name
was Natumbundra.

1029
01:09:07,115 --> 01:09:10,050
That idiot Jackson!
Now the blacks will start.

1030
01:09:10,284 --> 01:09:13,617
Barbara's wedding will
disassociate us from all this.

1031
01:09:13,955 --> 01:09:18,790
The Colemans are a perfect family.
They've never been divorced,have they?

1032
01:09:19,961 --> 01:09:23,124
See?
We're on our way to salvation.

1033
01:09:24,298 --> 01:09:28,462
And it was a question of Albert
or your mother.

1034
01:09:28,803 --> 01:09:30,794
So I had to choose.

1035
01:09:31,139 --> 01:09:33,300
And I chose Albert.

1036
01:09:34,976 --> 01:09:36,967
You understand that,don't you?

1037
01:09:37,478 --> 01:09:38,809
I knew you would.

1038
01:09:41,816 --> 01:09:44,148
I can't get this damn tie even.

1039
01:09:44,819 --> 01:09:46,650
Well,the jacket will cover it.

1040
01:09:48,489 --> 01:09:50,821
I look like my grandfather
in this suit.

1041
01:09:51,492 --> 01:09:55,258
He always dressed like this.
He killed himself at 30.

1042
01:09:56,664 --> 01:09:58,154
Any last instructions?

1043
01:09:58,499 --> 01:10:01,662
Just don't walk unless you have to.

1044
01:10:02,537 --> 01:10:04,027
And don't gesture.

1045
01:10:05,306 --> 01:10:06,466
That all?

1046
01:10:06,774 --> 01:10:08,435
Don't talk...

1047
01:10:08,776 --> 01:10:10,107
too much.

1048
01:10:11,846 --> 01:10:13,677
Who cares?
This won't work.

1049
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:19,009
Come on! Don't be so negative.
I think we can pull this off.

1050
01:11:16,911 --> 01:11:18,242
What?

1051
01:11:20,514 --> 01:11:22,004
No good?

1052
01:11:24,585 --> 01:11:28,077
Why?
I'm dressed just the way you are.

1053
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:31,751
I took off all my rings.

1054
01:11:32,426 --> 01:11:34,417
I'm not wearing any makeup.

1055
01:11:36,264 --> 01:11:37,595
I'm just...

1056
01:11:39,767 --> 01:11:41,257
a 'guy.'

1057
01:11:43,271 --> 01:11:44,602
What about those?

1058
01:11:48,109 --> 01:11:52,773
Those?
Well,one does want a hint of color.

1059
01:12:00,121 --> 01:12:03,284
You're thinking
that dressed this way...

1060
01:12:03,624 --> 01:12:06,457
I'm even more obvious,
aren't you?

1061
01:12:14,302 --> 01:12:15,633
You're right.

1062
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:29,813
I just wanted so much to help you.

1063
01:12:34,155 --> 01:12:35,645
And you hate me.

1064
01:12:37,158 --> 01:12:39,319
You both hate me.

1065
01:12:45,166 --> 01:12:46,827
We don't hate you.

1066
01:12:50,104 --> 01:12:52,436
...better treat me right

1067
01:12:54,175 --> 01:12:56,666
She works hard for the money

1068
01:12:58,179 --> 01:13:00,670
So hard for it,honey

1069
01:13:02,183 --> 01:13:07,177
I work hard for the money
So you better treat me right

1070
01:13:07,788 --> 01:13:09,016
That's right

1071
01:13:09,523 --> 01:13:11,286
Better put your shoes on.
It's late.

1072
01:13:11,359 --> 01:13:14,851
There's no point
in my putting shoes on,sir.

1073
01:13:15,196 --> 01:13:18,688
I never wear shoes
because they make me fall down.

1074
01:13:18,966 --> 01:13:20,957
Just put your shoes on!

1075
01:13:21,202 --> 01:13:25,536
And talk in your normal voice.
Give me a break.

1076
01:13:27,875 --> 01:13:29,035
Okay.

1077
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:41,211
Armand?
It's Katharine.

1078
01:13:41,555 --> 01:13:43,386
I'm in the car,and I got...

1079
01:13:43,657 --> 01:13:46,319
a message telling me not to come.

1080
01:13:46,727 --> 01:13:51,221
No,that was a mistake.
He said not to come late. I was there.

1081
01:13:51,565 --> 01:13:54,398
I thought my secretary got it wrong.

1082
01:13:54,668 --> 01:13:57,330
I should be there in half an hour.

1083
01:13:58,739 --> 01:14:00,229
Is this Val?

1084
01:14:03,244 --> 01:14:06,236
Val,I want you to know how...

1085
01:14:07,415 --> 01:14:10,179
happy I am that
I can do this for you.

1086
01:14:10,584 --> 01:14:12,575
I know it's a little late.

1087
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:14,751
No,it's fine.

1088
01:14:16,090 --> 01:14:18,081
Thanks for this.

1089
01:14:20,428 --> 01:14:23,761
So,um,see you in half an hour...

1090
01:14:24,598 --> 01:14:25,929
Mom.

1091
01:14:30,104 --> 01:14:33,767
Did you just say,
'See you in half an hour,Mom'?

1092
01:14:34,375 --> 01:14:35,706
-Was that?
-Yes.

1093
01:14:35,943 --> 01:14:37,911
You can't call her back.
She's in the car.

1094
01:14:37,978 --> 01:14:39,138
Are you crazy?

1095
01:14:39,213 --> 01:14:42,546
Albert is hysterical now. You know
what he'll do if Katharine comes?

1096
01:14:42,616 --> 01:14:44,447
Nothing.
He won't embarrass me.

1097
01:14:44,785 --> 01:14:47,720
It was my mother.
I couldn't tell her not to come.

1098
01:14:48,289 --> 01:14:51,725
Pop,without her I'm screwed.
You know that.

1099
01:14:58,132 --> 01:15:02,296
So this is hell.
And there's a crucifix in it.

1100
01:15:22,656 --> 01:15:26,148
This is less like Palm Beach
than I imagined.

1101
01:15:26,594 --> 01:15:28,755
It was all sand
when they bought here.

1102
01:15:28,996 --> 01:15:32,329
This grew up around them
while they were in Greece.

1103
01:15:38,506 --> 01:15:43,102
He's locked himself in. If we're lucky,
he won't come out at all.

1104
01:15:45,779 --> 01:15:50,682
I'm not religious,and I'm Jewish. But
if things go well,I'd appreciate it.

1105
01:15:52,019 --> 01:15:56,513
Speaking of Jewish,Barbara told
her parents our last name is Coleman.

1106
01:15:58,192 --> 01:15:59,352
Thanks.

1107
01:16:01,028 --> 01:16:02,359
Coming.

1108
01:16:03,864 --> 01:16:05,024
Perfect.

1109
01:16:08,135 --> 01:16:09,796
It's the shoes.

1110
01:16:15,543 --> 01:16:20,037
Good evening.
I am Spartacus,the Goldmans' butler.

1111
01:16:20,548 --> 01:16:23,039
Please,come--
Come in.

1112
01:16:25,386 --> 01:16:27,149
Is that Goldman?

1113
01:16:27,388 --> 01:16:30,380
Coldman,Coldman.
Spartacus is,uh...

1114
01:16:30,724 --> 01:16:32,055
-Guatemalan.
-new.

1115
01:16:32,726 --> 01:16:35,490
Val,this is my father
and my mother.

1116
01:16:36,230 --> 01:16:37,891
This is Val Coleman.

1117
01:16:39,233 --> 01:16:40,723
Coleman or Coldman?

1118
01:16:41,001 --> 01:16:42,229
Coleman.

1119
01:16:42,670 --> 01:16:44,501
The 'd' is silent.

1120
01:16:44,738 --> 01:16:45,898
My father.

1121
01:16:48,542 --> 01:16:50,032
My daughter,Barbara.

1122
01:16:50,411 --> 01:16:51,571
Delighted.

1123
01:16:53,514 --> 01:16:54,503
My husband.

1124
01:16:56,083 --> 01:16:57,072
Extremely honored.

1125
01:16:57,251 --> 01:16:59,583
You have a very forceful handshake.

1126
01:16:59,853 --> 01:17:01,252
You have to in Greece.

1127
01:17:05,593 --> 01:17:08,585
My mother won't be here
for another 15 minutes.

1128
01:17:08,862 --> 01:17:11,194
She's with my grandparents
in Palm Beach.

1129
01:17:11,865 --> 01:17:14,095
Oh,isn't that nice?

1130
01:17:14,368 --> 01:17:17,030
Having contact
between the generations.

1131
01:17:17,271 --> 01:17:19,432
Yes.
Won't you come in?

1132
01:17:22,276 --> 01:17:25,268
How's the leg?
My father has an old football injury.

1133
01:17:25,546 --> 01:17:27,707
A fellow sufferer.
Where did you play?

1134
01:17:27,948 --> 01:17:29,779
-Greece.
-Miami U.

1135
01:17:30,784 --> 01:17:31,944
What an interesting room.

1136
01:17:32,286 --> 01:17:34,550
Don't you think this room is nice?

1137
01:17:34,788 --> 01:17:37,450
Well,yes.
A very,very...

1138
01:17:37,791 --> 01:17:42,455
pleasant vacation house.
I like it's,uh,severity.

1139
01:17:42,796 --> 01:17:47,233
Dad uses this place more for work and...
reflection than anything else.

1140
01:17:47,468 --> 01:17:50,801
So it's not so much
a vacation house as a--

1141
01:17:51,071 --> 01:17:52,402
Monastery.

1142
01:17:53,140 --> 01:17:55,631
Well,it's just charming.

1143
01:17:55,976 --> 01:17:59,468
And look at these lovely old books.

1144
01:18:00,481 --> 01:18:01,812
Look at this.

1145
01:18:02,316 --> 01:18:05,649
'Nancy Drew and the Case
of the Burning Candle.'

1146
01:18:05,986 --> 01:18:07,647
You have the whole series.

1147
01:18:07,988 --> 01:18:09,478
Uh,they're my mother's.

1148
01:18:09,823 --> 01:18:10,983
Sit down!

1149
01:18:12,493 --> 01:18:13,824
Please.

1150
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:32,342
Shall we have champagne to celebrate?

1151
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:34,341
Oh,how nice.

1152
01:18:34,682 --> 01:18:36,013
-Agador!
-Spartacus!

1153
01:18:36,350 --> 01:18:41,117
Agador Spartacus! He insists
on being called by his full name.

1154
01:18:48,128 --> 01:18:49,959
We'd like the champagne now.

1155
01:19:04,244 --> 01:19:06,576
Over there?
Okay,thanks.

1156
01:19:08,082 --> 01:19:09,413
God bless you.

1157
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:11,581
They went in around the corner.

1158
01:19:11,852 --> 01:19:14,514
That's the side entrance
to this building. The club?

1159
01:19:14,755 --> 01:19:16,086
Let's check it out.

1160
01:19:17,091 --> 01:19:20,424
You have such a responsibility,
two houses.

1161
01:19:20,761 --> 01:19:22,592
When did you buy this one?

1162
01:19:22,863 --> 01:19:26,526
About 15 years ago.
The area was mostly Jewish then.

1163
01:19:26,767 --> 01:19:29,930
Really? Barbara told us
it was mostly sand.

1164
01:19:31,772 --> 01:19:35,765
Yes. Well,you know the old saying,
'Where there's sand...'

1165
01:19:37,277 --> 01:19:40,440
Here we go.
Champagne for everyone.

1166
01:19:41,281 --> 01:19:43,374
And a scotch,if you have it.

1167
01:19:46,386 --> 01:19:47,717
Is someone else home?

1168
01:19:48,789 --> 01:19:53,123
Just our dog,Piranha. We always lock
her in when there's company.

1169
01:19:56,130 --> 01:19:58,792
I'll finish pouring.
Go finish dinner.

1170
01:20:08,475 --> 01:20:12,912
He's a brilliant chef. He just has
a lot to learn about serving.

1171
01:20:14,414 --> 01:20:16,746
Where could the wife be?

1172
01:20:39,339 --> 01:20:42,172
He was so weird.

1173
01:20:42,509 --> 01:20:44,500
No,I really was.

1174
01:20:44,845 --> 01:20:46,676
I was like,
'Will you marry me?'

1175
01:20:47,347 --> 01:20:50,680
She was like,
'Didn't you say no way before thirty?'

1176
01:20:51,018 --> 01:20:52,508
It was so funny.

1177
01:20:52,853 --> 01:20:56,016
Yes,it does sound funny.

1178
01:21:00,027 --> 01:21:02,518
How was your trip,Senator?

1179
01:21:03,530 --> 01:21:06,192
A nice trip.
Very nice.

1180
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:10,964
We decided to drive down
to see the seasons change.

1181
01:21:12,372 --> 01:21:16,206
It was a long trip,though:
Virginia,Kentucky...

1182
01:21:16,543 --> 01:21:17,874
Tennessee...

1183
01:21:18,879 --> 01:21:20,210
Georgia.

1184
01:21:20,714 --> 01:21:25,378
It was just so magical to come
from the North,where it's cold...

1185
01:21:26,053 --> 01:21:28,385
to the South,
where it's warm...

1186
01:21:29,056 --> 01:21:32,890
and see the tremendous differences
from region to region...

1187
01:21:33,227 --> 01:21:35,718
in this incredible country
of ours.

1188
01:21:38,565 --> 01:21:41,227
My wife and I
used to go to Virginia...

1189
01:21:41,501 --> 01:21:44,061
every autumn
to see the foliage turn.

1190
01:21:44,905 --> 01:21:47,066
Virginia has amazing foliage...

1191
01:21:47,407 --> 01:21:51,571
although I do think that
the foliage in Ohio is underrated.

1192
01:21:54,414 --> 01:21:57,406
It's just dazzling along I-75.

1193
01:22:02,589 --> 01:22:04,079
Just dazzling.

1194
01:22:05,259 --> 01:22:09,252
We would go down to Virginia,
to get away for a while.

1195
01:22:09,529 --> 01:22:13,590
To see the wonderful farms,
the countryside.

1196
01:22:13,934 --> 01:22:17,267
I'm stuck in traffic.
Start dinner without me.

1197
01:22:17,938 --> 01:22:20,429
The hills,the mountains.

1198
01:22:22,442 --> 01:22:25,275
Talk about
'purple mountains' majesty.'

1199
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:28,271
Just fantastic.

1200
01:22:30,117 --> 01:22:32,950
Red leaves,purple mountains...

1201
01:22:34,788 --> 01:22:36,380
green fields.

1202
01:22:38,792 --> 01:22:41,454
And the roads.
Black...

1203
01:22:42,896 --> 01:22:44,727
cutting through the green.

1204
01:22:45,899 --> 01:22:47,560
All the colors.

1205
01:22:48,468 --> 01:22:49,799
The trees.

1206
01:22:53,907 --> 01:22:55,898
PennsyIvania's nice too.

1207
01:22:57,577 --> 01:22:58,908
Was that my wife?

1208
01:22:59,646 --> 01:23:01,307
Just now on the phone?

1209
01:23:01,581 --> 01:23:04,243
I think it was.
I was just so caught up.

1210
01:23:04,484 --> 01:23:06,475
Val,was that Mom?

1211
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:09,152
Yeah. She's stuck.

1212
01:23:09,489 --> 01:23:11,423
We're to start dinner without her.

1213
01:23:11,658 --> 01:23:15,492
I would have picked up,but I was
so interested in the senator's...

1214
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:17,256
story.

1215
01:23:17,497 --> 01:23:19,328
Oh,it wasn't that good.

1216
01:23:19,666 --> 01:23:20,997
It was wonderful.

1217
01:23:21,835 --> 01:23:26,499
Will you excuse me? I should tell
Agador Spartacus this news.

1218
01:23:41,688 --> 01:23:43,519
Would you excuse us?

1219
01:23:46,793 --> 01:23:49,455
I've never had so much
go so wrong so quickly.

1220
01:23:49,529 --> 01:23:51,019
This is like a curse!

1221
01:23:51,098 --> 01:23:54,693
Dad,what do we do?
Do we wait for her or do we--

1222
01:23:55,035 --> 01:23:56,229
You're soaking!

1223
01:23:56,303 --> 01:23:58,134
I'm sweating
like some farm animal.

1224
01:23:58,372 --> 01:24:02,035
-I can't do this.
-We can do this! Work with me.

1225
01:24:02,709 --> 01:24:05,041
Something very odd is going on.

1226
01:24:05,312 --> 01:24:07,303
It's this thing with Jackson.

1227
01:24:07,547 --> 01:24:11,313
The wife doesn't want to see us,
and the father's a wreck.

1228
01:24:11,551 --> 01:24:13,212
I'm sure that's not it.

1229
01:24:13,553 --> 01:24:17,649
No,it's something else. Something
about the father and the butler.

1230
01:24:18,392 --> 01:24:20,053
-It's nothing!
-It is something.

1231
01:24:20,327 --> 01:24:22,727
It's not!
You always think the worst.

1232
01:24:22,963 --> 01:24:24,988
-I don't!
-You always do!

1233
01:24:25,065 --> 01:24:27,295
-Val's mother is just late.
-Listen,young lady!

1234
01:24:27,367 --> 01:24:28,561
She's late!

1235
01:24:28,835 --> 01:24:31,395
-Watch yourself,young lady!
-Here they come.

1236
01:24:32,572 --> 01:24:33,732
Excuse me.

1237
01:24:35,075 --> 01:24:36,736
Well,we'll...

1238
01:24:37,911 --> 01:24:40,903
give her a half hour,
and if she isn't--

1239
01:24:42,049 --> 01:24:43,516
Here I am!

1240
01:24:43,583 --> 01:24:45,073
Oh,please...

1241
01:24:45,185 --> 01:24:49,679
forgive me for being so late,
but traffic was unbelievable!

1242
01:24:50,090 --> 01:24:52,752
Senator Keeley,Mrs. Keeley...

1243
01:24:53,093 --> 01:24:56,256
I'm so happy
to meet you at last.

1244
01:24:56,763 --> 01:24:59,095
You must be Barbara.

1245
01:24:59,933 --> 01:25:01,594
What a pretty child.

1246
01:25:01,935 --> 01:25:03,368
Come give me a hug.

1247
01:25:04,104 --> 01:25:06,197
Don't be afraid.

1248
01:25:06,306 --> 01:25:09,070
Oh,how adorable.
She's shy.

1249
01:25:09,142 --> 01:25:11,372
How nice to meet you,
Mrs. Coleman.

1250
01:25:11,611 --> 01:25:12,771
Goldman.

1251
01:25:13,013 --> 01:25:14,480
Isn't the 'd' silent?

1252
01:25:14,548 --> 01:25:18,450
It is pronounced Coleman,isn't it?
We've had some confusion.

1253
01:25:18,952 --> 01:25:21,113
Oh,yes.
Coleman.

1254
01:25:21,455 --> 01:25:24,117
The 'd' is silent in America.

1255
01:25:24,458 --> 01:25:28,724
It's Cole d'isle au Man,
or Cole of the Isle of Man in France...

1256
01:25:28,962 --> 01:25:31,453
where Armand's chateau is...

1257
01:25:32,065 --> 01:25:35,228
Cole d'man in Greece
where Armand's work is...

1258
01:25:35,469 --> 01:25:39,803
and finally,the vulgar Coleman
in Florida,where Armand's home is.

1259
01:25:40,073 --> 01:25:44,908
So,we never know where we are
until we hear our last name pronounced.

1260
01:25:47,314 --> 01:25:48,975
That explains it.

1261
01:25:49,416 --> 01:25:50,576
At last.

1262
01:25:51,818 --> 01:25:54,309
I would like to hug you,
Mrs. Coleman.

1263
01:25:54,488 --> 01:25:56,649
Oh,my dear child!

1264
01:25:57,157 --> 01:25:58,488
Welcome.

1265
01:25:59,092 --> 01:26:00,252
Look at this.

1266
01:26:00,994 --> 01:26:04,828
This is our footage for the show
on Jackson. Pump up the sound.

1267
01:26:05,599 --> 01:26:08,932
We're here at what
they're calling Camp Keeley...

1268
01:26:09,169 --> 01:26:10,659
Where you driving him?

1269
01:26:12,339 --> 01:26:14,170
South Beach,Florida.

1270
01:26:15,675 --> 01:26:16,937
Where is this?

1271
01:26:17,177 --> 01:26:20,340
Keeley's house last night.
The fat guy...

1272
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:24,844
is with the 'National Inquirer.'
Harry Radman.

1273
01:26:25,185 --> 01:26:30,122
Oh,yeah. My God,he's put on so much
weight since the Simpson case.

1274
01:26:31,525 --> 01:26:33,117
This should go to the network.

1275
01:26:33,693 --> 01:26:36,184
It's so wonderful
what you've done here.

1276
01:26:36,463 --> 01:26:39,296
Everything is
so simple and uncluttered.

1277
01:26:39,533 --> 01:26:43,196
Our house is a sea of papers.
You men.

1278
01:26:43,470 --> 01:26:46,633
You're the biggest babies.
They can run the world...

1279
01:26:46,873 --> 01:26:48,704
but can't pick out a tie.

1280
01:26:49,042 --> 01:26:53,206
I know. I can't get
this big lug to buy a new suit.

1281
01:26:53,547 --> 01:26:55,208
Armand,they're picking on us.

1282
01:26:56,383 --> 01:26:57,714
Oh,well...

1283
01:26:58,051 --> 01:27:01,214
bless them.
That's the way nature made them.

1284
01:27:01,555 --> 01:27:03,887
Maybe I'm just
an old-fashioned girl...

1285
01:27:04,224 --> 01:27:08,558
but I pity the woman who's too busy
to take care of her man.

1286
01:27:08,828 --> 01:27:12,161
Hear,hear! It's so nice
to meet people like you.

1287
01:27:12,499 --> 01:27:13,830
Our kind of people.

1288
01:27:16,403 --> 01:27:20,737
C-o-I-e-m-a-n.
There's no first name on the bell.

1289
01:27:21,241 --> 01:27:22,902
Sure?
They can't find them.

1290
01:27:23,176 --> 01:27:27,340
What about the name in front
of the club? Goldman? That's close.

1291
01:27:27,581 --> 01:27:30,243
You're right.
Wouldn't that be something?

1292
01:27:30,517 --> 01:27:32,508
Try Goldman.
What was it?

1293
01:27:32,752 --> 01:27:34,083
Armand Goldman.

1294
01:27:34,754 --> 01:27:38,588
It's so odd to me,
this fuss over school prayer.

1295
01:27:38,858 --> 01:27:41,520
As if anyone--
Jews,Muslims,whatever...

1296
01:27:41,761 --> 01:27:44,525
would mind if their children
prayed in the classroom.

1297
01:27:44,764 --> 01:27:46,425
It's insane.

1298
01:27:48,268 --> 01:27:50,930
Thank you,Agador Spartacus!
You may go.

1299
01:27:53,940 --> 01:27:56,773
He's very nice,but such a problem.

1300
01:27:57,110 --> 01:27:59,442
We never know what makes him laugh.

1301
01:28:00,447 --> 01:28:02,108
At least he speaks English.

1302
01:28:02,382 --> 01:28:05,874
We have been through more chauffeurs
in the last six months.

1303
01:28:06,119 --> 01:28:09,782
And the maids we've been through
in the last six years!

1304
01:28:10,056 --> 01:28:11,717
Rodney,Bruno,Chuck--

1305
01:28:11,958 --> 01:28:14,119
Look!
You all need more ice.

1306
01:28:14,394 --> 01:28:16,726
I have a good feeling
about you people.

1307
01:28:16,963 --> 01:28:20,956
Not a lot of clever books on
the shelves,no fancy art on the walls.

1308
01:28:21,234 --> 01:28:25,068
Just the crucifix and a lot
of good,warm,family feeling.

1309
01:28:25,138 --> 01:28:27,299
This is what Clinton
didn't understand...

1310
01:28:27,374 --> 01:28:30,036
when he started in on school prayer
and gays in the military.

1311
01:28:30,110 --> 01:28:31,634
More ice for you.

1312
01:28:31,811 --> 01:28:35,076
There's an idiotic issue.
Gays in the military!

1313
01:28:35,315 --> 01:28:38,478
I mean,those haircuts,
those uniforms. Who cares?

1314
01:28:38,752 --> 01:28:41,585
Mom,don't talk about things
you don't know about.

1315
01:28:41,821 --> 01:28:44,483
Don't patronize your mother.
She's amazingly intelligent.

1316
01:28:44,758 --> 01:28:46,089
I think homosexuality--

1317
01:28:46,159 --> 01:28:47,558
A lot more ice for you!

1318
01:28:47,627 --> 01:28:48,924
More for me,Dad.

1319
01:28:48,995 --> 01:28:50,986
is weakening this country.

1320
01:28:51,331 --> 01:28:55,995
That's what I thought until I found out
Alexander the Great was a fag.

1321
01:28:56,269 --> 01:28:58,100
Talk about gays in the military!

1322
01:28:58,338 --> 01:29:00,499
How about those Dolphins?

1323
01:29:04,844 --> 01:29:06,004
I'll get it.

1324
01:29:11,184 --> 01:29:13,675
I think we're skirting
an issue here...

1325
01:29:13,953 --> 01:29:15,944
that has Mr. Coleman
very nervous.

1326
01:29:16,022 --> 01:29:17,853
And I don't blame him.

1327
01:29:19,192 --> 01:29:22,355
You must have heard
about how Senator Jackson died.

1328
01:29:24,030 --> 01:29:25,861
Oh,that.

1329
01:29:26,533 --> 01:29:29,366
Yes,what an ugly story.

1330
01:29:30,036 --> 01:29:32,527
Of course,we don't believe
a word of it.

1331
01:29:32,972 --> 01:29:33,961
What do you mean?

1332
01:29:34,207 --> 01:29:35,868
He was obviously framed.

1333
01:29:36,209 --> 01:29:38,541
I,for one,
would like an autopsy.

1334
01:29:38,812 --> 01:29:39,972
Uh,Mom...

1335
01:29:41,047 --> 01:29:43,311
That's just what
Rush Limbaugh said.

1336
01:29:45,885 --> 01:29:47,045
Excuse me.

1337
01:29:51,825 --> 01:29:55,886
The tension. It's like riding a
psychotic horse toward a burning stable.

1338
01:29:56,162 --> 01:29:59,063
Dinner is going to be late,okay?

1339
01:29:59,399 --> 01:30:02,562
'Cause you give me
so little time to shop.

1340
01:30:02,769 --> 01:30:04,600
The girl is nice.

1341
01:30:05,071 --> 01:30:07,835
I owe it to Val. Growing up the way
he did,it can't have been easy.

1342
01:30:07,907 --> 01:30:11,502
I'm sorry to laugh at Miss Albert,
but what is that hairdo?

1343
01:30:11,745 --> 01:30:15,408
Fuck it! It's one night.
I can live through it.

1344
01:30:17,016 --> 01:30:20,247
Of course,it's wrong to kill
an abortion doctor.

1345
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:22,278
-Many pro-lifers...
-Dad?

1346
01:30:22,355 --> 01:30:25,051
I don't agree with them,
but many sincerely feel...

1347
01:30:25,125 --> 01:30:26,615
I'm here,son.

1348
01:30:26,693 --> 01:30:29,025
stop the doctors,
you stop the abortions.

1349
01:30:29,262 --> 01:30:32,754
That's ridiculous.
The doctors are only doing their jobs.

1350
01:30:33,032 --> 01:30:36,092
Better to kill the mothers.
That will stop them.

1351
01:30:36,770 --> 01:30:38,431
May I see you a moment,dear?

1352
01:30:38,705 --> 01:30:42,766
I know,I know. If you kill
the mother,the fetus dies too.

1353
01:30:43,042 --> 01:30:47,035
But the fetus is going to be aborted,
so let it go down with the ship.

1354
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:49,441
I really must see you now.

1355
01:30:51,117 --> 01:30:52,448
Excuse me.

1356
01:30:59,459 --> 01:31:01,290
I assure you...

1357
01:31:01,628 --> 01:31:05,120
Mother is just following a train
of thought to a logical...

1358
01:31:05,398 --> 01:31:07,127
yet absurd,conclusion.

1359
01:31:07,233 --> 01:31:09,224
Very much the way
Jonathan Swift did...

1360
01:31:09,302 --> 01:31:12,396
when he suggested that Irish peasants
feed their babies to the rich.

1361
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:16,302
Well,I know one thing
about your mother.

1362
01:31:16,576 --> 01:31:20,569
She's a passionate woman who follows
her heart. And I love her.

1363
01:31:23,149 --> 01:31:25,140
So Goldman owns the club...

1364
01:31:25,485 --> 01:31:28,977
lives above it,
owns the building,and he's gay.

1365
01:31:30,490 --> 01:31:32,822
We are in 'Inquirer' heaven.

1366
01:31:36,162 --> 01:31:38,824
I could have danced all night

1367
01:31:39,165 --> 01:31:42,157
I could have danced all night

1368
01:31:42,502 --> 01:31:47,166
And still have begged for more

1369
01:31:47,774 --> 01:31:49,105
You have a beautiful voice.

1370
01:31:49,342 --> 01:31:51,833
I could have spread my wings

1371
01:31:52,178 --> 01:31:55,011
And done a thousand things

1372
01:31:55,348 --> 01:31:59,842
I've never done before

1373
01:32:00,453 --> 01:32:03,354
Your mother should know
I want a career and marriage.

1374
01:32:03,623 --> 01:32:06,786
Barbara,Albert isn't my mother.
He's a drag queen.

1375
01:32:07,026 --> 01:32:10,359
That's right.
I keep forgetting.

1376
01:32:10,697 --> 01:32:13,689
He just sounds
so much like a mother.

1377
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:18,603
I only know when he

1378
01:32:18,671 --> 01:32:21,970
Began to dance with me

1379
01:32:22,041 --> 01:32:26,375
I could have danced,danced,danced

1380
01:32:27,046 --> 01:32:29,378
All night

1381
01:32:35,121 --> 01:32:36,281
Bravo!

1382
01:32:40,226 --> 01:32:43,218
What a lovely voice you have,
Agador Spartacus.

1383
01:32:43,563 --> 01:32:48,057
Thank you. Thank you,all.
Dinner is served.

1384
01:32:48,902 --> 01:32:53,896
Wonderful. This way,Senator.
You know,I played Eliza in high school.

1385
01:32:54,240 --> 01:32:55,832
I'll bet you were lovely.

1386
01:32:58,912 --> 01:33:02,245
Go inside. I'll tape a note
to Katharine to the door.

1387
01:33:02,916 --> 01:33:06,249
Mrs. Keeley over there,
and the senator on my right.

1388
01:33:06,519 --> 01:33:10,011
Val over here.
And Barbara,dear,please sit.

1389
01:33:10,256 --> 01:33:12,121
You are the most gracious hostess.

1390
01:33:12,191 --> 01:33:14,421
Oh,thank you so much.

1391
01:33:14,761 --> 01:33:17,252
I'm having such a wonderful time.

1392
01:33:17,597 --> 01:33:19,929
This is what
I've always dreamed of...

1393
01:33:20,266 --> 01:33:24,100
a big,loving family gathered
around the table...

1394
01:33:24,437 --> 01:33:26,200
the way it was
when I was a girl.

1395
01:33:26,439 --> 01:33:28,600
That's the way we grew up too.

1396
01:33:28,942 --> 01:33:33,572
It was a wonderful world then,
wasn't it? Happy families and...

1397
01:33:33,646 --> 01:33:37,275
everyone speaking English
and no drugs and no AIDS.

1398
01:33:37,550 --> 01:33:38,539
Easy on the wine,Mom.

1399
01:33:38,785 --> 01:33:40,548
What interesting china!

1400
01:33:41,287 --> 01:33:44,279
It looks like young men
playing leapfrog.

1401
01:33:44,624 --> 01:33:46,114
Is it Greek?

1402
01:33:49,128 --> 01:33:51,119
I-- I...

1403
01:33:51,464 --> 01:33:53,056
I have no idea.

1404
01:33:53,466 --> 01:33:55,457
I've never seen these bowls before.

1405
01:33:55,735 --> 01:33:58,795
Really?
Barbara,get me my glasses,dear.

1406
01:33:59,072 --> 01:34:01,063
They're in my purse by the chair.

1407
01:34:01,307 --> 01:34:03,969
Where are my glasses?
It is Greek.

1408
01:34:04,811 --> 01:34:09,009
Greek boys,actually.
Uh,naked Greek boys.

1409
01:34:09,082 --> 01:34:12,017
And girls!
Doesn't your bowl have girls?

1410
01:34:12,485 --> 01:34:15,420
-I have one.
-So do I! Oh,look!

1411
01:34:15,822 --> 01:34:18,313
There.
I think that's a girl.

1412
01:34:18,758 --> 01:34:22,091
Then you haven't seen one
in a long time. That's a boy.

1413
01:34:22,328 --> 01:34:25,161
I may need glasses,
but I can see that.

1414
01:34:25,832 --> 01:34:29,268
I couldn't find your glasses.
Maybe they're in the car.

1415
01:34:29,502 --> 01:34:31,493
I have mine.
Here.

1416
01:34:33,606 --> 01:34:36,268
Hurry,you idiot!
They're looking at the bowls.

1417
01:34:36,342 --> 01:34:39,106
What kind of moron puts out bowls
without looking at them!

1418
01:34:39,178 --> 01:34:41,510
Stop ladling!
Give me the pot!

1419
01:34:41,781 --> 01:34:43,442
-You can't serve out of that!
-Move!

1420
01:34:43,683 --> 01:34:45,776
Wait!
There's shrimps.

1421
01:34:46,185 --> 01:34:47,516
Let's see what they're doing.

1422
01:34:48,688 --> 01:34:49,848
Here we go.

1423
01:34:51,190 --> 01:34:56,184
Agador's superb soup. We're in luck.
He doesn't make this for everyone.

1424
01:34:56,529 --> 01:34:59,862
This is his specialty,
seafood chowder.

1425
01:35:00,199 --> 01:35:02,531
Isn't that an egg?

1426
01:35:02,869 --> 01:35:05,702
Why,yes,it is.
It is a huevo.

1427
01:35:06,039 --> 01:35:08,371
This is so Guatemala.

1428
01:35:08,708 --> 01:35:11,541
They put eggs in everything
down there...

1429
01:35:11,811 --> 01:35:14,974
because chicken is
so important to them.

1430
01:35:15,214 --> 01:35:17,876
It's their only real currency.

1431
01:35:18,217 --> 01:35:21,152
A woman is said to be
worth her weight in hens.

1432
01:35:21,387 --> 01:35:25,050
A man's wealth is measured
by the size of his cock.

1433
01:35:25,391 --> 01:35:27,052
Will you excuse me?

1434
01:35:30,830 --> 01:35:31,990
What the hell is this?

1435
01:35:32,231 --> 01:35:35,997
Sweet-and-sour peasant soup.
Why'd you say it was seafood chowder?

1436
01:35:36,235 --> 01:35:39,727
-What the hell is that?
-I don't know. I made it up!

1437
01:35:40,006 --> 01:35:41,837
God,this is a nightmare.

1438
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:56,252
Where are you staying in Florida?

1439
01:35:56,923 --> 01:36:00,256
With the Jeb Bushes,
on Fisher Island.

1440
01:36:00,526 --> 01:36:04,018
Fisher Island.
Such a lovely spot.

1441
01:36:04,197 --> 01:36:08,361
My parents lived on Fisher Island
until they died.

1442
01:36:09,435 --> 01:36:12,268
I thought you were visiting
your parents in Palm Beach.

1443
01:36:13,106 --> 01:36:14,095
What?

1444
01:36:16,442 --> 01:36:18,933
Yes,uh... now...

1445
01:36:19,779 --> 01:36:21,440
that they're dead.

1446
01:36:21,781 --> 01:36:23,271
They moved...

1447
01:36:23,783 --> 01:36:26,616
were moved... because...

1448
01:36:28,955 --> 01:36:30,286
well...

1449
01:36:30,790 --> 01:36:34,453
my mother always said,
'Live on Fisher Island...

1450
01:36:34,727 --> 01:36:36,718
get buried in Palm Beach...

1451
01:36:36,963 --> 01:36:40,296
that way you'll
have the best of Florida.'

1452
01:36:41,801 --> 01:36:45,134
Dad,get in there.
Everything is going to hell.

1453
01:36:45,471 --> 01:36:47,462
He didn't make an entree.

1454
01:36:47,807 --> 01:36:50,640
What?
You mean we just have soup?

1455
01:36:51,144 --> 01:36:54,079
Peasant soup is an entree.
It's like stew!

1456
01:36:54,147 --> 01:36:55,978
Why do you think I put
so much in it?

1457
01:36:56,048 --> 01:36:57,481
Shut up!

1458
01:36:57,750 --> 01:37:00,412
Put Katharine's note
on the downstairs door.

1459
01:37:00,586 --> 01:37:03,316
I have to go back before
they get to the bottom of the bowls.

1460
01:37:03,589 --> 01:37:06,922
I had so much to do.
You give me no time to shop!

1461
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:08,320
Shut up!

1462
01:37:08,661 --> 01:37:10,993
It's okay!
We're all right!

1463
01:37:11,264 --> 01:37:14,256
Shut up,goddamn you!
Stop crying! Goddamn you!

1464
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:17,833
Don't just stand there!
She'll be here any minute! Go!

1465
01:37:18,104 --> 01:37:20,334
Goddamn it!
Fuck the shrimp!

1466
01:37:25,044 --> 01:37:26,375
Oh,my God.

1467
01:37:27,547 --> 01:37:30,380
That's it. That's it.
That's the Lincoln.

1468
01:37:30,650 --> 01:37:32,811
Park here.
The street's jammed.

1469
01:37:33,052 --> 01:37:34,383
This is an intersection.

1470
01:37:34,654 --> 01:37:36,485
So? We're the press.

1471
01:37:48,067 --> 01:37:52,333
'Katharine,do not go upstairs.
I'll call you tomorrow. Armand.'

1472
01:37:53,339 --> 01:37:55,000
This is going to be great.

1473
01:37:56,075 --> 01:38:00,409
From that day on,they looked
for a cemetery they really loved...

1474
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:02,170
instead of eating tofu.

1475
01:38:02,415 --> 01:38:05,077
Daddy favored Key Biscayne,but--

1476
01:38:05,351 --> 01:38:07,512
Time for dessert.
You get everything done?

1477
01:38:08,588 --> 01:38:11,580
Shall we have our coffee
in the living room?

1478
01:38:15,761 --> 01:38:19,424
No,it's his town car.
I am looking at it.

1479
01:38:20,099 --> 01:38:24,092
We're in the middle of a bunch
of drag clubs. I don't know.

1480
01:38:24,937 --> 01:38:26,598
We got authorization.

1481
01:38:26,939 --> 01:38:28,270
So,three?

1482
01:38:30,877 --> 01:38:32,208
So,where are they?

1483
01:38:32,445 --> 01:38:34,538
They went around the corner,there.

1484
01:38:43,055 --> 01:38:45,717
So what do you think
of these kids getting married?

1485
01:38:45,958 --> 01:38:50,793
Well,she's only eighteen,
and he's only twenty,so I--

1486
01:38:52,064 --> 01:38:55,227
Good God. That sounds like
it's coming from downstairs.

1487
01:38:55,468 --> 01:38:58,960
It must be coming
from that nightclub around the corner.

1488
01:38:59,238 --> 01:39:01,138
This must be the same building.

1489
01:39:01,807 --> 01:39:06,141
You're joking! I always thought
that was someone's television set.

1490
01:39:06,412 --> 01:39:09,575
Now,Mother,you know
we live above a nightclub.

1491
01:39:09,982 --> 01:39:12,815
She's traveled around the world,
but deep down...

1492
01:39:13,085 --> 01:39:15,485
she's still a girl
from Grover's Corners.

1493
01:39:15,755 --> 01:39:19,088
I'm afraid I am a bit naive.

1494
01:39:19,492 --> 01:39:21,926
Don't be ashamed
of Grover's Corners.

1495
01:39:22,428 --> 01:39:26,262
It's not a chateau,
but it's a darn good place to call home.

1496
01:39:26,666 --> 01:39:30,158
Thank you.
I will remember that.

1497
01:39:30,503 --> 01:39:35,167
Of course,Armand is
much more sophisticated than I am.

1498
01:39:35,508 --> 01:39:40,002
But then,
he comes from such good stock.

1499
01:39:40,346 --> 01:39:43,338
Just like
these two adorable youngsters.

1500
01:39:43,683 --> 01:39:45,514
Don't you agree?

1501
01:39:46,018 --> 01:39:48,350
-Where's the bathroom?
-I'll show you.

1502
01:39:48,688 --> 01:39:52,522
-No,I want Mother Coleman to show me.
-My dear child!

1503
01:39:52,792 --> 01:39:54,123
One kiss,darling.

1504
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:56,794
-I'm only going to the bathroom.
-We'll all go.

1505
01:39:57,029 --> 01:39:58,860
I think you're all crazy.

1506
01:39:59,131 --> 01:40:00,962
My men!

1507
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:03,862
Isn't this wonderful?
All of us together.

1508
01:40:04,203 --> 01:40:07,866
This is so moving.
I think I'm going to cry!

1509
01:40:08,541 --> 01:40:11,704
Something very strange
is going on.

1510
01:40:12,378 --> 01:40:13,538
I know.

1511
01:40:13,879 --> 01:40:15,369
I mean,that dinner.

1512
01:40:16,382 --> 01:40:19,374
I know there was something
on those bowls.

1513
01:40:19,719 --> 01:40:22,711
And the son disappearing
while we were eating.

1514
01:40:22,989 --> 01:40:25,480
-I know just what's going on.
-You do?

1515
01:40:25,558 --> 01:40:27,492
It's the oldest story
in the world.

1516
01:40:27,727 --> 01:40:29,058
What is it?

1517
01:40:31,897 --> 01:40:34,058
She's a small town girl...

1518
01:40:35,568 --> 01:40:39,561
and he's a pretentious European--
the worst kind.

1519
01:40:39,905 --> 01:40:41,998
Him and his Cole d' whatever.

1520
01:40:42,241 --> 01:40:45,233
And his decadent china.
I've seen it all before.

1521
01:40:45,578 --> 01:40:47,910
Aristotle Onassis was like this.

1522
01:40:48,247 --> 01:40:51,739
And all of the French,
especially Mitterand.

1523
01:40:51,917 --> 01:40:54,750
And the English.
Not Margaret Thatcher,of course.

1524
01:40:55,021 --> 01:40:59,014
But I bet John Major has something on
the side. And she can't handle it.

1525
01:40:59,191 --> 01:41:00,852
-Who?
-Mrs. Coleman.

1526
01:41:01,093 --> 01:41:03,254
Why should she care
about John Major?

1527
01:41:03,596 --> 01:41:06,588
No.
Mrs. Coleman can't handle him.

1528
01:41:06,932 --> 01:41:10,265
Coleman and his nasty little
European traditions.

1529
01:41:11,270 --> 01:41:15,036
And his snobbery.
And that dig about Grover's Corners.

1530
01:41:15,274 --> 01:41:16,935
Kevin,you're rambling.

1531
01:41:17,209 --> 01:41:21,202
Well,it makes me furious.
The contempt he has for her.

1532
01:41:21,447 --> 01:41:25,281
Did you see him when she talked?
He looked almost frightened.

1533
01:41:25,618 --> 01:41:29,952
He won't let her run the house.
He's in the kitchen. He serves.

1534
01:41:30,222 --> 01:41:32,782
He tells that beige savage
what to do.

1535
01:41:38,297 --> 01:41:39,457
What?

1536
01:41:40,132 --> 01:41:43,795
I'm so sorry.
I've ruined everything!

1537
01:41:44,136 --> 01:41:47,902
Don't be silly. No one noticed the wig.
Where's the spirit gum?

1538
01:41:48,140 --> 01:41:49,630
They took everything away.

1539
01:41:49,909 --> 01:41:53,640
I have a barrette. If you don't
move your head,it might work.

1540
01:41:53,913 --> 01:41:56,575
Thank you.
You're a very sweet girl.

1541
01:41:57,316 --> 01:41:59,477
I'm so sorry,Val.

1542
01:42:00,152 --> 01:42:03,986
You didn't have this kind
of sympathy for poor Bessie Jackson!

1543
01:42:04,056 --> 01:42:06,752
Bessie Jackson is
an insensitive cow.

1544
01:42:06,992 --> 01:42:10,655
This woman is a lady.
You know,she'll be your in-law too.

1545
01:42:10,930 --> 01:42:15,594
If he's so terrible,maybe your daughter
shouldn't marry his son!

1546
01:42:15,835 --> 01:42:20,329
He's not terrible in that way.
He won't get mixed up in some scandal.

1547
01:42:20,606 --> 01:42:23,006
I've never really seen
you before.

1548
01:42:23,843 --> 01:42:26,004
I don't even know who you are!

1549
01:42:26,345 --> 01:42:30,008
You're not worried about Barbara.
You only think of your career.

1550
01:42:30,282 --> 01:42:32,614
And poor little Mrs. Coleman!

1551
01:42:32,852 --> 01:42:37,346
You're as worried about my career
as I am. You pushed for the marriage.

1552
01:42:37,623 --> 01:42:41,787
Barbara can handle that boy.
She's modern,tough as nails.

1553
01:42:42,027 --> 01:42:46,361
Poor Mrs. Coleman cries if you call
her 'Mother.' She's that vulnerable.

1554
01:42:46,699 --> 01:42:50,191
It breaks my heart.
They don't make women like that anymore.

1555
01:42:52,872 --> 01:42:55,033
Hello!
I'm home!

1556
01:42:55,541 --> 01:42:56,872
I forgot my key.

1557
01:42:57,143 --> 01:42:58,041
Who is it?

1558
01:42:58,377 --> 01:43:00,208
Val's mother,Mrs. Goldman.

1559
01:43:00,813 --> 01:43:02,474
Is Armand there?

1560
01:43:04,216 --> 01:43:05,376
Val's mother?

1561
01:43:05,718 --> 01:43:07,049
Mrs. Goldman?

1562
01:43:08,721 --> 01:43:12,555
So this is the whole story.
The bastard has a live-in mistress.

1563
01:43:12,892 --> 01:43:14,553
I'll get the door.

1564
01:43:14,894 --> 01:43:17,055
No,you're in the wrong house!

1565
01:43:17,563 --> 01:43:22,557
Good evening. May I take your purse,
as usual? Or...

1566
01:43:23,402 --> 01:43:25,233
for the first time.

1567
01:43:26,238 --> 01:43:28,729
You must be Senator and Mrs. Keeley.

1568
01:43:29,074 --> 01:43:33,170
Katharine Goldman. Delighted to
meet you. I'm sorry I'm so late--

1569
01:43:33,412 --> 01:43:37,746
Sorry to take so long,but Barbara--
What is she doing here?

1570
01:43:38,083 --> 01:43:39,072
Let me explain.

1571
01:43:39,351 --> 01:43:41,683
Please do.
Explain to all of us.

1572
01:43:41,921 --> 01:43:44,412
I don't want to embarrass
this lovely lady...

1573
01:43:44,690 --> 01:43:47,181
but how many mothers
does Val have?

1574
01:43:48,694 --> 01:43:50,685
This woman introduced herself...

1575
01:43:50,930 --> 01:43:54,764
as Val's mother.
How many mothers does he have?

1576
01:43:58,771 --> 01:44:00,102
Just one.

1577
01:44:04,610 --> 01:44:06,100
This is my mother.

1578
01:44:07,446 --> 01:44:10,938
My father owns the club downstairs.
My mother is the star.

1579
01:44:12,151 --> 01:44:13,618
What?

1580
01:44:14,453 --> 01:44:18,446
We lied to you,Barbara and I.
And everyone lied for us.

1581
01:44:19,124 --> 01:44:20,716
These are my parents.

1582
01:44:22,294 --> 01:44:24,125
This is my wife.

1583
01:44:24,964 --> 01:44:27,455
This is the lady who had Val.

1584
01:44:27,900 --> 01:44:29,561
Nice to meet you,Katharine.

1585
01:44:30,636 --> 01:44:32,069
Very nice,Val.

1586
01:44:32,805 --> 01:44:34,466
You've done a good job.

1587
01:44:34,974 --> 01:44:37,636
Thank you.
We're very proud of him.

1588
01:44:37,977 --> 01:44:39,308
I don't understand.

1589
01:44:39,645 --> 01:44:43,979
Barbara,the nightclub downstairs,
he owns it?

1590
01:44:46,085 --> 01:44:47,916
He's not a cultural attach谷?

1591
01:44:49,989 --> 01:44:53,823
No. And he isn't married
to a housewife.

1592
01:44:54,159 --> 01:44:57,151
And their name is Goldman,
not Coleman.

1593
01:44:57,663 --> 01:44:59,153
They're Jewish.

1594
01:44:59,665 --> 01:45:01,155
I don't understand.

1595
01:45:02,501 --> 01:45:05,163
He's a man.
They're both men.

1596
01:45:05,437 --> 01:45:07,428
No. You can't be Jewish.

1597
01:45:07,673 --> 01:45:09,504
No,Kevin,Kevin,Kevin.

1598
01:45:10,009 --> 01:45:12,842
Kevin,this is a man.

1599
01:45:14,179 --> 01:45:15,168
What?

1600
01:45:15,681 --> 01:45:17,842
Don't you see?
They're gay.

1601
01:45:18,183 --> 01:45:21,675
They own the drag club downstairs.
They're two men.

1602
01:45:25,624 --> 01:45:26,955
Senator Keeley...

1603
01:45:27,693 --> 01:45:32,630
this may not help,but I want you
to know I meant every word I said...

1604
01:45:32,865 --> 01:45:37,529
about a return to family values
and a stricter moral code.

1605
01:45:37,870 --> 01:45:39,303
I feel like I'm insane.

1606
01:45:39,538 --> 01:45:41,199
It's really very simple.

1607
01:45:41,473 --> 01:45:43,304
She called you Mother Coleman.

1608
01:45:43,542 --> 01:45:47,034
Kevin,nothing has changed.
It's still me.

1609
01:45:47,379 --> 01:45:50,212
With one tiny difference.

1610
01:45:51,717 --> 01:45:53,548
Well,not tiny.

1611
01:45:58,724 --> 01:46:00,055
I don't understand.

1612
01:46:00,392 --> 01:46:04,055
I'll explain in the car.
Come on,Barbara. Let's go.

1613
01:46:04,396 --> 01:46:06,387
I'm not coming.

1614
01:46:07,232 --> 01:46:10,395
Barbara,please don't do this to me.

1615
01:46:10,903 --> 01:46:15,067
I may not be as vulnerable
as Mrs. Coleman...

1616
01:46:15,574 --> 01:46:17,735
but I still have feelings.

1617
01:46:18,410 --> 01:46:21,402
Somebody has to like me best.

1618
01:46:24,083 --> 01:46:28,577
Take it easy,Louise.
Barbara,we're leaving now.

1619
01:46:29,922 --> 01:46:32,584
-You're coming with us.
-Daddy,please.

1620
01:46:33,759 --> 01:46:37,092
I've made your mother cry.
I'm up for reelection.

1621
01:46:37,296 --> 01:46:38,957
We're in the middle
of a scandal.

1622
01:46:39,031 --> 01:46:42,523
I'm in the home of a gay couple
who own a drag club.

1623
01:46:42,601 --> 01:46:46,594
You want to get married,but how many
lives must you ruin to do it?

1624
01:46:55,614 --> 01:46:56,774
I...

1625
01:46:57,282 --> 01:47:00,217
I would have liked to have
had you as my family.

1626
01:47:06,625 --> 01:47:10,288
I just want to say,
Mr. and Mrs.,uh,Mr...

1627
01:47:10,963 --> 01:47:15,297
whatever your name is,
I hope this doesn't influence your vote.

1628
01:47:17,970 --> 01:47:19,460
Senator Keeley!

1629
01:47:21,707 --> 01:47:23,038
Oh,no.

1630
01:47:23,942 --> 01:47:25,432
Did you get him?

1631
01:47:25,511 --> 01:47:27,502
No,I would have
if you hadn't said his name.

1632
01:47:27,579 --> 01:47:29,570
I wanted to make him turn.

1633
01:47:39,158 --> 01:47:40,819
Those vultures.

1634
01:47:42,995 --> 01:47:47,659
Another television van just arrived.
And a car. It says 'Florida Eagle.'

1635
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,991
Oh,that's just print news.

1636
01:47:50,135 --> 01:47:51,966
It'll have a great headline:

1637
01:47:52,037 --> 01:47:55,871
'Senator Jackson and His Women;
Senator Keeley and His Men'

1638
01:47:55,941 --> 01:47:57,772
It's perfectly innocent.

1639
01:47:57,843 --> 01:48:02,109
You came to meet the parents
of the boy Barbara wants to marry.

1640
01:48:02,347 --> 01:48:05,839
Louise,people in this country
don't care about details.

1641
01:48:06,118 --> 01:48:08,450
All they trust are headlines.

1642
01:48:08,687 --> 01:48:13,522
But what do they have? It's their word
against yours that you're even here.

1643
01:48:13,859 --> 01:48:17,192
Yes,but at some point,
I'll have to leave.

1644
01:48:17,463 --> 01:48:19,795
People will notice
if I'm never seen again.

1645
01:48:20,032 --> 01:48:23,627
Another television crew.
And they're going into the club!

1646
01:48:23,869 --> 01:48:27,532
Wouldn't you know it?
The one night I don't perform.

1647
01:48:27,873 --> 01:48:29,534
Can I get anyone some soup?

1648
01:48:30,042 --> 01:48:31,373
No.

1649
01:48:32,878 --> 01:48:34,368
Daddy,I'm sorry.

1650
01:48:34,646 --> 01:48:35,635
I know.

1651
01:48:35,881 --> 01:48:37,212
Senator?

1652
01:48:38,383 --> 01:48:40,044
Another shot for you?

1653
01:48:40,319 --> 01:48:41,650
I don't really drink.

1654
01:48:41,887 --> 01:48:45,050
Yeah,but...
now is the time to pretend.

1655
01:48:47,059 --> 01:48:48,890
Give me some candy,Louise.

1656
01:48:49,728 --> 01:48:52,891
Couldn't the Keeleys slip out
at the end of the show?

1657
01:48:53,165 --> 01:48:56,066
No,they're waiting for that.
They'd be recognized.

1658
01:48:59,071 --> 01:49:01,062
Not necessarily.

1659
01:49:29,434 --> 01:49:31,425
A big hand for our girls.

1660
01:49:31,703 --> 01:49:36,436
As we come to the end of our show,
you are family,too,so sing along.

1661
01:49:36,942 --> 01:49:39,274
We are family

1662
01:49:40,779 --> 01:49:43,441
I got all my sisters with me

1663
01:49:44,783 --> 01:49:47,115
We are family

1664
01:49:48,787 --> 01:49:51,449
Get up,everybody,and sing

1665
01:50:45,844 --> 01:50:47,334
Will they keep waiting?

1666
01:50:47,613 --> 01:50:51,515
They have to. There's no story
if they don't get him coming out.

1667
01:50:52,017 --> 01:50:54,679
Get up,everybody,and sing

1668
01:51:12,037 --> 01:51:14,369
We are family

1669
01:51:16,041 --> 01:51:18,703
I got all my sisters with me

1670
01:51:20,045 --> 01:51:22,377
We are family

1671
01:51:24,049 --> 01:51:26,711
Get up,everybody,and sing

1672
01:51:36,395 --> 01:51:38,727
We are family

1673
01:51:44,403 --> 01:51:48,396
Work it. Sell it.
Own it. Go,girlfriend.

1674
01:51:51,743 --> 01:51:52,732
Come on.

1675
01:52:00,085 --> 01:52:02,417
We are family

1676
01:52:08,093 --> 01:52:10,425
We are family

1677
01:52:19,604 --> 01:52:22,266
I've never danced with a man before.

1678
01:52:23,275 --> 01:52:25,266
There's always a first time.

1679
01:52:26,778 --> 01:52:28,109
Perd?name.

1680
01:52:30,415 --> 01:52:32,406
No one will dance with me.

1681
01:52:32,484 --> 01:52:35,544
It's this dress.
I knew white would make me look fat.

1682
01:52:35,620 --> 01:52:38,453
What about me?
I'm as pretty as these other guys.

1683
01:52:38,724 --> 01:52:39,713
Dance?

1684
01:52:40,025 --> 01:52:41,515
Not you.
Barbara.

1685
01:52:41,560 --> 01:52:44,893
Don't go. I don't want to be
the only girl not dancing.

1686
01:52:45,130 --> 01:52:48,463
Just head for the door.
We'll be out of here soon.

1687
01:52:49,968 --> 01:52:52,630
Care to dance,baby?

1688
01:53:48,193 --> 01:53:51,856
Meet me in 20 minutes
at the corner of EI Dorado and Palm.

1689
01:53:52,197 --> 01:53:55,189
Lady,not for a million dollars.

1690
01:55:00,765 --> 01:55:03,598
Bob Dole is gorgeous!

1691
01:55:11,443 --> 01:55:13,604
Which one is the mother?

1692
01:55:16,281 --> 01:55:18,112
I just don't know.

1693
01:55:19,451 --> 01:55:20,782
Mazel tov.

1694
01:55:21,119 --> 01:55:24,054
As a sign of your union,
you may kiss the bride.

1695
01:55:33,465 --> 01:55:35,126
I'm sorry.
