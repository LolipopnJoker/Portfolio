1
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,640
- Have you eaten anything?
- No.

2
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,880
Hey, look, what is this, a picnic?
Come on. Let's go, man.
We got ten minutes to go.

3
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,280
- Punch me out, man.
- You got it.

4
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,280
Any word from the LAPD intelligence,
if there is such a thing?

5
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,720
- Not yet, sir.
- Of course not.

6
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,560
Because we're a covert
anti-terrorism team that is so secret...

7
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,560
that when we snap our fingers
nothin' happens!

8
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,840
Sheriff's department?
Airport police?

9
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,680
Still waiting. But lnterpol
insists he's in Tripoli.

10
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,160
Yeah, well, you-you trust-- You trust
that billion-dollar satellite, okay?

11
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,240
l'll trust a ten-dollar snitch
at this point.

12
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,400
- Sean, look--
- What?

13
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,200
Why don't you just give 'em
a little break, okay?

14
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,880
We'll take a break
when the case breaks, okay?

15
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,440
Hallelujah

16
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,480
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah

17
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,400
Hallelujah

18
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,000
Hallelujah, hallelujah

19
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,080
For the Lord God
Omnipotent reigneth

20
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,920
Hallelu-- Hallelu--
Hallelujah

21
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,920
For the Lord God
Omnipotent reigneth

22
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,600
Hallelu-- Hallelu--
Hallelu-- Hallelu-- Hallelujah

23
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:40,440
For the Lord God
Omnipotent reigneth

24
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,080
Hallelujah

25
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,440
- And he shall reign for ever and ever
- l never really enjoyed The Messiah.

26
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,560
- ln fact, l think it's fucking boring.
- And he shall reign for ever and ever

27
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,480
But your voice makes even a hack
like Handel seem like a genius.

28
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,120
Hallelujah, hallelujah

29
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,280
Hallelujah, hallelujah

30
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,480
Hallelujah

31
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,720
Hallelujah, hallelujah

32
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:14,880
Hallelujah

33
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,880
Victor-- When we--
When we put this thing to bed,

34
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,320
y-you can brand
the Fourth Amendment on my butt.

35
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,840
- Thank you.
- Sir, excuse me.
Your wife is on line one.

36
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,480
Sean! A jet was just chartered.
Anderson Airfield.

37
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,120
Guess who paid the bill in cash?
Pollux Troy.

38
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,960
- Put one of our people on that plane.
- Wait! We still got no sign of Castor!

39
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,920
Pollux doesn't fly without
Big Brother. Now come on!

40
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,680
You're 26 minutes late.
The casing didn't fit, right?

41
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,560
Yeah, l told you goddam Dietrich
would try to pawn off some...

42
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,680
cheap-shit North Korean plastic.

43
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,720
Casing fit like a condom.

44
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,080
You didn't deviate
from the plan, did you, Pollux?

45
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,800
Well, how long did you want me
to sit here twiddling my thumbs?

46
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,480
l paid for the jet.
Save us some time.

47
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,880
That's what the boys are for,
to hide our famous faces.

48
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,400
lf l didn't love you so damn
much, l'd have to kill you, bro.

49
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,080
l hate it when you
call me bro.

50
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,680
You guys are paid
to protect him from everybody,

51
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,960
including himself.

52
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,480
And stay away from downtown on the 18th.
lt's gonna be a little, um, smoggy.

53
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,520
Okay, my passengers are here.
l gotta go.

54
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,280
Let's go. Let's go.
l'm bored. Let's go.

55
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,000
- Here you go.
- Bravo.

56
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,800
Would you like anything else
once we're airborne?

57
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,920
Oh, a peach.

58
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,600
Sit. Come here.

59
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,360
You know, l can, uh,
eat a peach for hours.

60
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,480
Um, come here.

61
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:56,000
lf l were to send you flowers,
where would l, uh--

62
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,520
No, wait. Let me rephrase.

63
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,840
lf l were to let you
suck my tongue,

64
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,840
would you be grateful?

65
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,560
There's someone on the runway.

66
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,480
Get off of me!

67
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,200
- Archer.
- FBl!

68
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,520
This is a very big gun.
Fly the fuckin' plane!

69
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,600
Come on. That's it.

70
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,880
- Come on. Let's go!
- Goddam it. Don't play chicken
with a goddam jet!

71
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,640
Come on.

72
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,240
- He's got Winters! Goddam it!
- Damn it, Sean!

73
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,840
All units, pin 'em in!

74
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,720
Close in on 'em!

75
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,080
One of yours, Sean?

76
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,720
Shit!

77
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,880
Out. Come on. Go, go!

78
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,960
Goddam it, Sean!

79
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,360
Take off now.

80
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,200
- Fly!
- l can't!

81
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,760
Fly, bitch!

82
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,120
All units, locked and ready.
Follow Archer's lead.

83
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,560
What the fuck are you doing?

84
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,720
There's an engine out.
We gotta stop.

85
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,200
- Move, move, move!
- Get back! Back up!

86
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,680
Pollux!

87
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,760
- Cas!
- Get over here.

88
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,480
Back him to me.
Back him to me. He's mine!

89
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,360
Cas.

90
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,000
Secure the hangar.

91
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,000
Berkley, down!

92
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,200
Down!

93
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,400
Give up, Castor. Your time's up.

94
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,800
Well, you better hit me, Sean,
'cause you only got one bullet left.

95
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,520
So do you.

96
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:40,120
Wow. We've got
something in common.

97
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,440
We both know our guns.

98
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,160
What we don't have in common is that
l don't care if l live, and you do.

99
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,000
Sean, that hurts.

100
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,560
You're not having
any fun, are you, Sean?

101
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,280
Why don't you come with us?
Try terrorism for hire?

102
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,840
- We'll blow some shit up.
lt's more fun.
- Shut the fuck up.

103
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,440
You watch your fuckin' mouth!

104
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,600
l'm about to unleash
the biblical plague "Hell-A" deserves,

105
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,200
but l'll give this shithole
a break if my brother and l walk.

106
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,400
- Bullshit.
- Oh-Oh no, l-l see, l see.
Y-You think l'm bluffing.

107
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,800
Maybe l am.
But, then, maybe l'm not.

108
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,120
More importantly, what would
you do with me locked up?

109
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,400
You'd drive your wife
and kid crazy.

110
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,520
Say, how is your daughter,
anyway? ls she ripening by now?

111
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,080
Your-- Your darling Janie,
your little peach?

112
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,800
ls she ripe?

113
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,200
Okay.

114
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,520
O-Okay.

115
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,760
Policeman, don't shoot me.

116
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,480
l'm scared, Seanie!

117
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,440
Well, l think you better pull
the trigger,

118
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,400
because l don't give a fuck!

119
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,760
l'm ready

120
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,520
Ready for the big ride, baby

121
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,560
Well, Sean, looks like
Elvis done left the buildin'.

122
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,280
lt wasn't my fault.
Why won't you ever be on my side?

123
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,520
l am always on your side,
but you have to give me a chance--

124
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,840
Now what?

125
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,840
She was suspended again. Some kid
made a crack about her clothes--

126
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,840
- She started a fight.
- That's right, Dad.
Don't even ask me what happened.

127
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,560
Okay. What happened?

128
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,040
- Ah, l see.
- Not like you would believe me anyway.

129
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,640
Jamie, look,
it-it-it's not easy, okay?

130
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,760
l mean, loo-- You change the way
you look every week.

131
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,200
And-And the way you act.
Who are you supposed to be now?

132
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,520
l'm supposed to be me.

133
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,960
Not like you have a clue
who l am anyway.

134
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,840
l have to work tonight.

135
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,680
l called to tell you,
but l was on hold for ten minutes,
and l couldn't wait any longer.

136
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,840
l got him, Eve.

137
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,920
lt's over.

138
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,920
lt's over.

139
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,200
Oh, Sean.

140
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,640
l'll make it up to you
and Jamie. l promise.

141
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,800
l'll put in for a desk job--
Well, l'll-- l'll do counselling,
sit down, talk about Mike--

142
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,000
l'll do it, anything you want.

143
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,640
l just want you.

144
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,400
Well, good, 'cause that's
what you're gonna get.

145
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,320
You happy?

146
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,560
Yes. Yeah.

147
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,640
What is all this?

148
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,480
Sir, the ClA sent this over.

149
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,600
l didn't know they catered.
Send it back.

150
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,880
No, wait.

151
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,080
How about, uh--

152
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,800
What about to Anderson,
Montgomery,

153
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,000
Berkley,

154
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,080
Pincus, Gianelli, Winters--

155
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,440
How's Loomis?

156
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,120
Uh, he's gonna need
a little surgery, but, uh,

157
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,960
he'll be okay.

158
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,960
- What's up?
- Special ops. They want a word.

159
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,120
Aw, forget it.
l don't have the time.

160
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,040
Better make time, Sean.

161
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,360
Recovered from the jet wreckage.

162
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,480
Found in Pollux Troy's
briefcase.

163
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,160
Porcelain casing.

164
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,080
Thermal cloak.

165
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,080
Nerve gas
and biological payload.

166
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,280
lt's enough to flatten
a square mile.

167
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,880
Then depending on
the prevailing winds,

168
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,760
the fallout'll be a tad worse
than Gulf War syndrome.

169
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,200
A biblical--
A biblical plague to LA.

170
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,360
Where is he?
Where is Pollux Troy?

171
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,640
Why draw the schematic if you're
not gonna build the bomb?

172
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,520
What, is it now a crime
in this country to exercise the mind?

173
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,600
- l'm interested in bomb--
- l won't say another word
until l see my brother.

174
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,680
Any progress?

175
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,400
- l need about ten minutes alone
with this guy.
- Ah, give it a rest.

176
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,720
You got Castor. Just go home.

177
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,040
Look, we're not gonna evacuate
the city on your hunch.

178
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,040
Look, l know Castor too well
for this to be a hunch.

179
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,960
You know what, just-just run
the goddam bureau any way you like.

180
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:36,280
l could put an agent in his cell.
Maybe Pollux will let it slip.

181
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,960
Oh, come on.
He's a paranoid sociopath.

182
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,400
The only person he'd talk to about
that bomb is his brother, and he's dead.

183
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,320
There is one other possibility.

184
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,080
Oh, God.
You're keeping him alive.

185
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,240
Relax, Archer. He's a turnip.

186
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,720
Oh.

187
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,040
What if you could walk
into Erewhon Prison...

188
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,240
and give Pollux a nice, big
brotherly hug as Castor Troy?

189
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,040
l have no idea
what you're talking about.

190
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,360
Let me try. Malcolm Walsh.

191
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,960
- l run the bio-cover unit
for special ops.
- l know who you are.

192
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,400
- But you don't know what l can do.
- Uh--

193
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,360
Physical alteration.
Augmentation.

194
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,440
Dr Walsh can alter the likeness,
even the voice of a government witness.

195
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,440
l think you'll recognize
this patient.

196
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,120
We had to build your friend Loomis
a whole new ear from scratch.

197
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,480
What we're suggesting for you, Archer,
isn't a permanent transplant like that,

198
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,400
just a temporary trade.

199
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,320
Come here.

200
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,720
With the new anti-inflammatories,
healing takes days, not weeks.

201
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,960
Your blood types won't match,
but Pollux won't know that.

202
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,840
Height difference is negligible.

203
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:34,160
Skin pigment, eye pigment:
both almost identical.

204
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:39,400
We'll use laser shears for the hairline,
microplugs for body hair.

205
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:44,160
We'll do an abdominoplasti--
take care of those, uh, love handles.

206
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,040
But all that's the easy part.
Here's the real science.

207
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,440
This is a state-of-the-art,
morphogenetic template.

208
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,560
The inside is modeled
on your skull,

209
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,040
the outside exactly like Troy's.

210
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,880
Then we fit his face on top.
Not a replica, but the real thing.

211
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,640
Then we simply connect the muscles,
tear ducts and nerve endings.

212
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,640
- So, you wanna take his face and mine--
- Borrow.

213
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,160
The procedure's
completely reversible.

214
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,960
Y-You think that l want
to do this?

215
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,160
- No. No.
- There's no one else, Sean.

216
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,560
- No!
- You have lived and breathed
Castor Troy for years.

217
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,640
l'll get his gang to talk.
That's what l do.

218
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:24,560
What if you can't? The bomb will blow,
and Castor Troy will win.

219
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,840
Get out. Go ahead.
Wipe your ass.

220
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,840
Damn, what the hell is
that smell?

221
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,560
He shit in his pants.
Where's Dietrich?

222
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:41,360
Hello, Sasha. When was the last
time you saw Castor Troy?

223
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,640
- Who cares? He's dead.
- Answer the question.

224
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,200
l know my rights. l don't have
to answer shit.

225
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,200
You're right, but know this:

226
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,640
You're a convicted felon on probation
for harbouring Castor Troy.

227
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,160
One phone call from me, and your son
will end up in a foster home.

228
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:03,200
l understand why
you would use such a threat.

229
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,920
But you try to take him away
from me, l swear to you--

230
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,120
l haven't seen him for years.

231
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,920
This reeks of you. lt's got
your signature all over it.

232
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,560
Maybe, but you ain't got nothin'
on me and you know it.

233
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,560
Maybe so, but l can keep you
within city limits,

234
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,640
or l can talk
to your sister again.

235
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,440
She's right outside.

236
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,080
Only this time l'll be nice.

237
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,640
Hey, Sean,

238
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,960
how's your dead son?

239
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:07,800
l don't know any--
Okay, okay, l heard somethin'
about the 18th, but that's all l know.

240
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,040
Great. So we got a date.
Now where the hell's the damn bomb?

241
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,320
Only Pollux Troy'll know that.

242
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,800
lt's your call, Sean.

243
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,920
- Does Lazarro know your plan?
- No, this is a black bag operation.

244
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:33,600
Strictly off the books. You can't tell
Lazarro, and you can't tell your wife.

245
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,080
Oh, God.

246
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,720
What are you asking me to do?
Okay, let's see.

247
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,320
You're asking me to--
to break the law,

248
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,080
risk my neck.

249
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,160
And you're asking me to put
in the dark all the people...

250
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,280
that love me...

251
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,200
and trust me.

252
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,160
l'll do it.

253
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,160
Sean.

254
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,040
Sorry l woke you.

255
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,520
l'm glad it's you that woke me.

256
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,320
And not a phone call telling me
you won't be coming home.

257
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,600
But that's a fear l can
finally let go of, huh?

258
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,520
Oh, it's all right, Sean.
lt's okay.

259
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,800
l keep--

260
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,880
l keep wanting to move this...

261
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,240
over here, you know?

262
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,840
lf it had only been an--
an inch to the left,

263
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,280
Mikey'd be alive.

264
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:35,720
And you wouldn't be.

265
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,840
Sean, things are gonna get
better now that you're home.

266
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,960
The scar won't move,
but it will heal if you let it.

267
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:47,320
Everything will be better
now that he is forever out of our lives.

268
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,720
Eve, if l told you
that l realize that--

269
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,080
that this thing
won't fully end...

270
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,160
u-until l did one last thing--

271
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,120
Eve, something vital.

272
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,360
Okay-- l-- You're going
back on assignment again.

273
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,680
This one last time.

274
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,240
Come on, Eve.

275
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,600
"l'm going anywhere,"
that's what you told me.

276
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,520
Oh.

277
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:43,440
You don't need me to tell you
what to do, Sean. You never have. So go.

278
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,680
But go now.

279
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:16,200
Sean, l changed my mind.
This is a suicide mission.

280
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,400
Yeah, l know, l know.

281
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,600
You know, maybe this, uh--
this doctor-- if he-- if he--

282
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:28,000
lf he can do even half
of what he says he can do,

283
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,000
maybe it'll work, l don't know.

284
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,560
l'd become Castor Troy,
be in control.

285
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,960
That's the part that scares me.

286
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,120
Doctor, l have, uh, something--

287
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,200
l have this scar-- that-- that--

288
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:52,080
that if you can p-put this back
after, after all this is over--

289
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,360
lt-- lt's important to me.
lt's-- lt's like a reminder.

290
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,840
Sure.

291
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,760
Tito, please,
hold this for me. Please.

292
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,400
Okay. Let's go.

293
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,160
Oh, G--

294
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,200
Oh, my God.

295
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,440
Hey, you okay? Come on.
Talk to me, Sean.

296
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,960
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

297
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,120
- Sean! Sean!
- Fuck you!

298
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,840
Sean, come on. Sit down.
Sit down. Sit down.

299
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,400
Sean! Sean! Archer!

300
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,960
You're Sean Archer.

301
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,920
Sean Archer. Sean Archer.

302
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:10,200
When this is over,
l want you to take this face...

303
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,520
and burn it.

304
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:17,440
Hey. l still
sound like me.

305
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:24,480
l've implanted a microchip
on your larynx. lt's fantastic,
but you'll have to be careful.

306
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,280
Pressure, sharp blow,
even a violent sneeze could dislodge it.

307
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,240
- Just repeat what you hear.
- Peach. l can eat a peach for hours.

308
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,520
Peach. l can eat a peach
for hours.

309
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,280
There's a scratchy tickle.

310
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,680
Peach. l can eat a peach
for hours.

311
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,560
Peach. l can eat a peach
for hours.

312
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:58,080
- Once again.
- Peach. l can eat a peach for hours.

313
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,480
- Perfect.
- Now, Sean, six days until the 18th.

314
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,600
The clock's ticking,
and so is the bomb.

315
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,240
You got two days
to get Pollux to talk.

316
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:29,920
Either way, Miller comes in,
pulls you out. You got me?

317
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,840
- What's the matter?
- Face itches.

318
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,880
You all right?
Come on. Let's go.

319
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,240
Archer's gonna be pissed when he comes
back from his training op and finds out.

320
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,960
The guy is knee-deep
in Georgia swamp.

321
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:46,040
You are now the property
of Erewhon Prison,

322
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,920
a citizen of nowhere.

323
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,000
The Geneva Convention
is void here.

324
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,160
Amnesty lnternational
doesn't know we exist.

325
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,440
When l say
your ass belongs to me,

326
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,800
l mean exactly that.

327
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,880
This entire prison's
one big magnetic field.

328
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,640
The boots tell us where you are.

329
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,480
621 to Population!

330
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:37,920
H-H-Hey, what's the matter, pal?
Don't you remember the little people?

331
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,320
- Burke Hicks.
- Oh, yeah.

332
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,320
l bust--

333
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,320
believe Sean Archer busted you
for stalkin' the UN Secretary General.

334
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,120
Oh, no. Archer framed me.
l ain't had nothin' to do with that.

335
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,400
No-- Word was you got wasted.

336
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,280
You wanna see what wasted
looks like, little man?

337
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,240
Pollux.

338
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,040
Yeah!

339
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,240
Out of the way. Central,
there's a disturbance in the population.

340
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,960
- Go to lockdown.
- Hold that lockdown.

341
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,120
Come on, you pussy!

342
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,600
You watch your fuckin' mouth.

343
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,400
You watch your fuckin' mouth!

344
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,320
'Cause l'm Castor Troy! Yeah!

345
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,560
l'm Castor Troy!

346
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,760
- Castor! Castor!
- l'm Castor Troy!

347
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,480
Yeah! Yeah!

348
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,640
Yeah!

349
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,120
Lock 'em down.

350
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,920
l stop the fights, not you.

351
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,920
That's two strikes for you, Dubov.
One more, you know where you're goin'.

352
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,880
- When l get out of here--
- lf you get out of here--

353
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,520
l'm gonna have you fired.

354
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:54,040
Lars, it's me.

355
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,120
Believe it.

356
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,640
Someone--

357
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:03,360
They took-- switched my-- wh--

358
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,560
F-- Some fucking--

359
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:12,000
But it's cool.
We're gonna deal with it.

360
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:23,000
Oh, yes, we're gonna deal
with it.

361
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,480
- What's this about?
- Dr Walsh.

362
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,680
l was just, uh, enjoying some
of your greatest hits here.

363
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,600
Oh-Oh, l hope you don't mind.
l-l, uh, l partook...

364
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:03,480
of your groovy, uh--
your groovy painkillers.

365
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:08,360
You know, this is fabulous work.
This is-- This is-- Oh, bravo.

366
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,520
Bra-fucking-vo.

367
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:16,520
Oh, God. This is excellent.
Bravo.

368
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,000
- Bravo.
- What do you want?

369
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:27,240
Take one goddam guess.

370
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:38,480
l wish they'd play some of those
salmon spawning scenes again.
l found them intensely erotic.

371
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:42,040
Fuckin' nature channel.

372
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:45,680
One more waterfall,
l'm gonna foam at the mouth.

373
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,960
lt's like
they're begging us to riot.

374
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,880
Excuse me.

375
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,320
Not feeling very coordinated
lately, are you?

376
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:04,280
Look, bro, you gotta help me.

377
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,160
l am so fried.

378
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:12,520
lf the psychos in here
find out l'm misfiring,
we're both gonna be dead meat.

379
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,840
Shock treatment?
What's the matter with you?

380
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,960
Did they operate?

381
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:20,640
l was in a coma. Jesus, you're
still so fuckin' paranoid.

382
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,560
Aren't they giving you
your medication in here?

383
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,120
What was my medication?

384
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,560
Pollux, l hand-fed you
those pills for years.

385
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,520
Vivex. l haven't forgotten that.

386
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,360
lt's just everything else.
lt's--

387
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:42,240
senses, my reflexes, my memory.

388
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,880
lt's like a tab of bad Quantrex.

389
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,200
l don't even know why that fucking Yeti
jumped me yesterday.

390
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,440
Dubov?

391
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:57,520
You had a sex sandwich with his wife and
his sister the night he was sent here.

392
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:01,400
l guess that explains
why he's so upset.

393
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,400
Wow.

394
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,920
We're gonna blow up LA, bro.
Ain't it cool?

395
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,480
Oh, right. Rub my nose
in it, why don't you?

396
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:16,840
$10 million design, and now those
militia nutjobs get to keep their cash.

397
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,800
lt's so fucking unfair.

398
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:24,080
That bomb you built
does deserve an audience.

399
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,440
lt's a work of art.

400
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,800
lt belongs in the Louvre.

401
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,720
Yes, it does. Oh, well.

402
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:35,880
l guess the LA Convention
Centre'll have to do.

403
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,560
- What?
- Thank you.

404
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,400
For what?

405
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,280
You are so fucking pathetic.

406
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,440
You got a visitor.

407
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,720
Ooh-wee, you good-lookin'.
You're hot!

408
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,680
lt's like looking
in a mirror, only not.

409
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:34,360
- Troy?
- Now that is between us, okay?

410
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,880
- But you were--
- ln a coma?

411
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,320
Nothing like having your face
cut off to disturb your sleep.
Read the newspaper lately?

412
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,560
- You killed them?
- Well, beats paying the bill, huh?

413
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:54,200
Come on. l mean, uh, if
a face-lift costs five grand--

414
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,880
See anything you like?

415
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,960
Tito.

416
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:16,320
l torched all the evidence
that proves you're you, okay?

417
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:21,080
So, wow, looks like you're gonna be
in here for the next hundred years!

418
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:25,800
Now, l have got to go.

419
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:31,120
l've got a government job to
abuse and a lonely wife to fuck.

420
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:33,680
Oh, did l say that?
Oh, l'm sorry. l didn't say that.

421
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,880
Make love to.

422
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:38,600
Oh, God, l miss that face.

423
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:43,000
Die!

424
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:46,040
Die!

425
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:56,680
- Sorry, Agent Archer.
- No, don't you worry about it,
Mr Walton.

426
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:59,960
Clearly he's, uh, had
a traumatic childhood,

427
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,440
and, uh, thank you.

428
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:09,040
What's givin' you the will
to live is lookin' for revenge

429
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:14,360
Look at this place. l'm in hell.

430
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,080
l may never get
a hard-on again.

431
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:24,520
Don't lose your head

432
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,720
Oh, yes.

433
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,920
There we go.

434
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:56,960
Well, l suppose it was only a matter of
time before you forgot where we lived.

435
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:00,280
Come on. Give me a break.

436
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:05,400
Every house in this block looks
the same. Then l spotted you.

437
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,480
Eve.

438
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:10,160
My one and only Eve.

439
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,840
So how was your
vital assignment?

440
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,480
Which one was that?

441
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:18,480
How should l know, Sean?

442
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:22,560
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh, yes. The, um--
the out of body experience.

443
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,760
Yes. That one.

444
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:29,840
- Where you goin'?
- To the hospital.

445
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:34,200
- No. No. What's the matter?
- Sean, come on.

446
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:37,240
- Oh, what?
- Quit teasing me. Stop it.
l'm still really hurt, okay?

447
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:40,360
- There are leftovers in the fridge.
- No, no.

448
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:44,000
l want to stay hungry
for you, my peach.

449
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,240
- Give me that tongue.
- Sean, come on.

450
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,000
- What are you doing?
What are you doing?
- What does Evie want?

451
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:53,440
Eve, l hate to see you go,
but l love to watch you leave.

452
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,920
"Date night fizzled again.

453
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:30,680
We haven't made love
in two months."

454
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,560
What a loser.

455
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:39,680
Come here, sister

456
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:43,280
- Papa's in the swing
- Got your E-mail, Karl.

457
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:46,360
- The poem you sent me was pretty kinky.
- He ain't too hip

458
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:50,000
About that new-breed babe

459
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:53,640
- The plot thickens.
- He ain't no drag

460
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:58,200
- Papa's got a brand new bag
- Hang on a second.

461
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:00,920
- Come here, Mama
- l'll have to call you back.

462
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:04,320
- And dig this crazy scene
- You're not respecting my boundaries.

463
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,120
- l'm coming in, Janie.
- He's not too fancy
- Janie?

464
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:12,200
- But this line is pretty clean
- l don't think you heard me, Jamie.

465
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:15,240
- He ain't no drag
- You got something that l crave.

466
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,960
Papa's got a brand new bag

467
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:23,160
He's doin' the jerk
He's doin' the fly

468
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,560
- Don't play him cheap
'cause you know he ain't shy
- Clarissa left those here.

469
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:28,400
- Well, l won't tell Mom
if you don't.
- He's doin' the Monkey

470
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:31,360
- The Mashed Potato, Jump-back Jack
- When did you start smoking?

471
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:36,920
- See you later, alligator
- You'll be seeing a lot
of changes around here.

472
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:41,160
- Papa's in the swing
- Papa's got a brand new bag. Ow!

473
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:44,080
He ain't too hip now

474
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:48,120
- But l can dig that new breed
- l can do the j-- do the s--

475
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:51,560
He's doin' the twist
just like this

476
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,240
Bye, bro.
Drop me a line sometime.

477
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,800
Gonna be kind of lonely
with Pollux gone, huh?

478
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,880
Po-- Pollux what?

479
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:22,040
That big-shit cop, Archer, cut him
a deal for turnin' state's evidence.

480
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,960
Your brother's been released.

481
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:31,680
l'm Sean Archer. There is a bomb
at the LA Convention Centre.

482
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,160
l'm Sean Archer and-- Ow!

483
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:52,400
Tiramisu, tiramisu

484
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:58,520
- Sir, we just wanted you to know--
- We're all really sorry about Tito.

485
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:01,240
Oh, hey, shit happens, you know?

486
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,960
So is our star witness talking?

487
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:07,800
Yeah. About what kind of mustard
he likes on his tongue sandwiches.

488
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:11,640
lf that bomb is out there,
we're almost out of time.

489
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,680
Archer!

490
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:18,760
You made the deal with Pollux Troy.
That isn't like you.

491
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:22,360
Well, when all else fails,
fresh tactics.

492
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,320
Fresh? Well, let me tell you
my fresh tactic.

493
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,960
From now on everything to do with
this case goes through me, understood?

494
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:30,400
Good. Thanks.

495
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:46,560
You're supposed to be snitching
and making me look good.

496
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:49,760
- Look good?
- Mm-hmm.

497
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:54,160
Seeing that face on you makes me afraid
my tiramisu might come back up.

498
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:59,160
Well, think about me. This nose.
This hair. This ridiculous chin.

499
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:02,880
Brother, we're going straight.

500
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:06,840
Oh, my goodness. Did you
exchange brains as well?

501
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,800
The first thing l need you to confess to
is the location of the bomb.

502
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,760
What about our $10 million?

503
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:17,720
What about when l become
an American hero for defusing
the bomb? What's that worth?

504
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:21,120
Know that. Thank you.
Next question.

505
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:28,360
- You're not the only one
in the family with brains.
- No.

506
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:32,160
- Although now l am
the only one with the looks.
- Touche.

507
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:36,560
This is an emergency evacuation.

508
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:41,440
This is an emergency evacuation.

509
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:45,160
Let's go. Police. Go! Go!

510
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:01,680
- Any ideas?
- Yeah, run.

511
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:06,040
Sir, it's protected by a tamper switch,
and it'll take us hours to bypass.

512
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:11,760
- Evacuate your team, Captain.
- No, but, sir, we can't--
we can't disarm.

513
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,680
Leave.

514
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:35,280
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah

515
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,520
Hallelujah

516
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,640
Ha-Ha. Ha, ha, ha.

517
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,880
Oh, baby. Oh--

518
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:56,040
That was the scene
at the LA Convention Centre,

519
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:59,080
where an FBl agent became
a city saviour.

520
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:04,720
Sean Archer disarmed a massive bomb just
one second before it was set to blow.

521
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:09,320
The apparent targets were
three Supreme Court justices
scheduled to speak here today...

522
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:12,400
and anyone unlucky enough to be
within a mile of the scene.

523
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:17,080
We asked Agent Archer if the FBl had
any leads on who planted the device.

524
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:19,720
Well, that is, uh,
classified information.

525
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:23,800
But if he-- lf he's listening,
l wouldn't mind giving him a message:

526
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,960
lnterception. Now our side's got
the ball. Sorry.

527
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,920
Wanda? Everybody.

528
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:16,600
Hey, look, l--
l wanna thank you for, uh,

529
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:22,000
enduring all these years
that l was an insufferable bore.

530
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:24,720
Sir, did you just have
a surgical procedure?

531
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:28,240
- What do you mean?
- Well, was the stick...

532
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:31,040
successfully removed
from your ass?

533
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:37,280
Sir. The White House on one.

534
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,880
lt's the president.
Oh, and your wife on line two.

535
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:42,400
- Well, you tell the president to hold.
- Okay.

536
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:15,160
- l got it.
- Sean, you scared the hell out of me.

537
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:18,000
- lt's date night.
- Oh, my God.

538
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:20,480
Oh, congratulations.

539
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,840
Oh, big deal.

540
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:28,280
Okay, l said, uh,
"Mr President,

541
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,000
"l want the authority...

542
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:33,400
"and l want the funds
and the personnel...

543
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:36,520
to take over the whole gamut
of global terrorism," right?

544
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:43,960
And he said, "The next name
on my calling list is Lazarro,

545
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:49,400
and l'm telling him that Sean Archer
writes his own ticket," okay?

546
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,240
What's the matter?

547
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:56,360
l-- l don't know, Sean.
You just--

548
01:02:56,520 --> 01:03:01,240
You just seem so different.
l mean, what is th-- all this about?

549
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:05,720
What-- This intimate
candlelight dinner? Huh?

550
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:09,000
And l'm supposed to forget
all the promises 'cause
you're going back into the fray?

551
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:32,120
lf the top cop in this country
can't come home...

552
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:37,000
every night to his wife,
then the hell with the country.

553
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:42,000
Because the only place
l'm going is upstairs with you.

554
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:59,960
Exercise. One hour.

555
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:12,120
How can l get out of here?

556
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,160
You can't.

557
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:17,040
How can l get these boots off?

558
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:19,320
They only take 'em off
in the clinic.

559
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,640
Right before
they fry your skull.

560
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:33,880
Hey.

561
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:39,080
- l'm out of cigarettes.
- Get back in line, Troy.

562
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:44,000
l said l'm out of cigarettes.

563
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:53,480
Kick his ass!

564
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:00,880
Hey, what the hell!
That's not right!

565
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:13,720
l need a light! l need a light!

566
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:15,880
- Anybody got a light?
- All right!

567
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:19,320
Anybody got a light?
Got a light?

568
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:34,040
You better bring the bastard down
before he chokes himself to death.

569
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:52,920
Well, happy day,
it's Castor Troy.

570
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:59,600
Wait. H-Hold it, hold it.
Can l, uh-- Can l have a light?

571
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:01,800
You know, those things'll kill you.

572
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:05,560
Get his boots, Walton.

573
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:15,240
Dubov, l didn't touch your wife.

574
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:18,600
And l didn't touch your sister.

575
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:23,240
But l know your wife loves you,
is waiting for you.

576
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,560
So let's get out of here.

577
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:27,720
You're more brain-dead than Dubov.

578
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:35,720
- Out.
- Out.

579
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:38,360
- Get him!
- Grab his arms!

580
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:40,520
Look out!

581
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:50,840
Shots have been fired.
We have men down in C-4.

582
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:53,360
- l got 'em.
- Throw 'em down!

583
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,720
Move!

584
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:35,280
Get down!

585
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:02,960
Dubov! No!

586
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,440
Get out.

587
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:54,000
Dubov!

588
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:01,200
Now, give me your hand.

589
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:03,480
Come on.

590
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:06,000
You can do it.

591
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:13,760
No!

592
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:49,000
No. No.

593
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:50,880
No!

594
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:11,360
Sean! Wait!

595
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:16,200
- What are you doing?
- Uh, l'm sorry.

596
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:21,400
- Have a nice day.
- Have a nice day?

597
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:25,800
What is with you? ls this your way
of just not dealing with this morning?

598
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:28,840
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

599
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:33,520
Sean! Sean!

600
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:38,400
l know it's hard for you, but it's hard
for me too, and we still have to go.

601
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:08,200
Happy birthday, Mikey.

602
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:17,400
He took our baby, Sean.
He took our little boy.

603
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,440
You turned your beeper off.

604
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:34,120
Yes, well-- my son's birthday.

605
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:36,520
Well, uh, here's
some poetic justice, sir.

606
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:41,360
- Castor Troy is dead.
- He got killed trying to escape
from Erewhon.

607
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:44,680
Where's his body?
l-l wanna see his body.

608
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:49,400
- lt hasn't been recovered yet.
- lt hasn't been recovered yet?

609
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:52,040
Get the LAPD on this!

610
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:55,360
Even if he is alive, Castor isn't
stupid enough to come back to the city.

611
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:02,440
You must-- You must trust me.
He's already here.

612
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,680
County General.
How may l direct your call?

613
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:47,880
Dr Archer, please.
lt's an emergency.

614
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:51,120
- May l say who's calling?
- Her husband.

615
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:53,920
Dr Archer, call on line three.

616
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:59,680
l know this sounds crazy,
but-- Shit!

617
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,680
- Sean?
- Eve, listen carefully.

618
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:06,160
The man you think is
your husband isn't.

619
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:08,440
- Who is this?
- Please, just listen.

620
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:12,680
Take Jamie. Go to your mother's. Don't
tell him where you're going, just go.

621
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:15,640
Uh, whoever you are,
don't call again.

622
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:28,360
- Operations.
- l need Victor Lazarro immediately.

623
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:31,120
- Regarding?
- l have information about Castor Troy.

624
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:34,600
l'll transfer you, sir.

625
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:37,280
Sean Archer here. Who's calling?

626
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:41,040
Well, if you're Sean Archer,
l guess l'm Castor Troy.

627
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:50,440
Ah, yes.

628
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:53,760
This escaped convict is
considered extremely dangerous.

629
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:57,720
lf you have any information concerning
the whereabouts of Castor Troy--

630
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:15,120
You goddam right. Yeah!

631
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:17,240
This shit's so good,
gonna make your dick hard.

632
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:20,200
Huh? Cheryl? Cheryl's a liar.

633
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,280
Dietrich.

634
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:27,960
So you're still selling hops
and drugs to Cheryl and Phil Roy.

635
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:33,480
Castor fucking Troy!

636
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:36,120
Aw, man. You scared me, man!

637
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:38,920
All right. All right.

638
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:42,160
You know, l never should've sold
you those bombs. lt's my curse.
l can't say no to a friend.

639
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:44,200
- You can't say no to money.
- Yeah, that's my other curse.

640
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,440
- You drug dealer.
- What's the matter?

641
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:48,440
- What?
- You look like you just fucked
your mother. Come on.

642
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:51,240
Let's go relax, huh?

643
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:01,640
Hey!

644
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:06,920
- Hey, Castor.
- Oh, Castor Troy!

645
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,720
l don't believe this.
Castor Troy!

646
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:13,920
What are you doing?

647
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,360
Wanna hit?

648
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:20,280
Hey, baby. Remember me?
l'm your favourite peach.

649
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:24,240
Oh, l thought
l was your favourite.

650
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:29,560
- You make me crazy
- Look at this guy.

651
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:32,040
You know, you look pretty good
for a dead guy.

652
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,320
Hey!

653
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:41,200
- Mescal.
- Two?
- Yeah.

654
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:46,560
So what do you wanna do?

655
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:57,560
You wanna get out
of the country?

656
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:01,520
l'm not going anywhere.
l'm gonna get Sean Archer.

657
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:05,080
With your help.

658
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:08,440
Okay.

659
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:17,200
Welcome home, baby.

660
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,600
How we supposed to do that?

661
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:37,600
He's vulnerable at home.

662
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:40,640
No. l mean, this is
Sean Archer we're talkin' about.

663
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:43,200
- This isn't just some Boy Scout.
- Fitch.

664
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:46,560
No. Besides, his house is
probably alarmed up the wazoo.

665
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:48,720
The code is 10-19-86.

666
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:52,280
That's his dead son's birthday.

667
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:54,880
Don't it just break your heart?

668
01:17:57,160 --> 01:18:00,880
- That's brilliant.
- That's sick.

669
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:06,120
How is it that you know
so much about Sean Archer?

670
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:09,640
Uh-- l, uh--

671
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:12,160
sleep with his wife.

672
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:19,280
Well.

673
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:35,520
This is gra-- This is great.

674
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:39,920
So, once we kidnap supercop,
then what?

675
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:45,760
Tiny...

676
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:48,040
surgery.

677
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:53,160
l'd like to take his--
his face--

678
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:55,840
off.

679
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:58,560
Yes.

680
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:00,640
Now, if you'll excuse me,

681
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:05,800
l have to use
the little boy's wee-wee room.

682
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,320
Cas.

683
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:16,720
You wanna take his face--

684
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:21,280
Yes. His face off.

685
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:23,520
Eyes.

686
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:26,080
Nose. Skin.

687
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:29,600
lt's coming off.

688
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:31,680
The face...

689
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,840
off.

690
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:42,960
No more drugs
for that man.

691
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:16,160
l'm not me.

692
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:18,320
l'm me.

693
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:20,640
Not me.
Me.

694
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:25,920
Castor Archer.

695
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:29,240
Castor Archer.

696
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:44,480
l thought you were dead.

697
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:47,240
l'm not dead.
l'm me.

698
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:53,200
No, no, no. Look. What l-- What
l'm trying to tell you, brother,

699
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:56,400
Pollux, is once we get the
full protection and resources...

700
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:59,800
of the government to help us
get rid of our rivals, right?

701
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:02,080
Then we'll be set.

702
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:05,080
Then maybe, just maybe, l'll
get my frickin' face back.

703
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:08,480
Then l'll just have one jag-off
to take care of.

704
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:18,920
- Hey, where ya goin'? Where ya goin'?
- Karl, stop it.

705
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,880
- Maybe two. Hold on.
- Karl, stop it!

706
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,880
- Calm down, would ya? Calm down.
- Karl!

707
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,880
Karl, my dad's home!
Let go!

708
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,880
- Happy hunting. l'll catch ya later.
- Stop it!

709
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,600
Yeah, like Mr Fuckin' lnvisible
gives a shit about you anyway.
So fuckin' hold still.

710
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:32,560
Calm down!

711
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:50,360
- Okay, say you're sorry.
- l'm sorry.

712
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:51,880
- l didn't hear it.
- l'm sorry!

713
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,720
- Mean it.
- l'm so sorry!

714
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:09,960
Dress up like Halloween and
ghouls will try to get in your pants.

715
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:14,080
Typical, Dad. Some guy tries
to rape me, and l'm to blame?

716
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:32,120
This isn't you.

717
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:35,120
Now you haven't been the same
since Mike died.

718
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:38,960
Hiding behind
someone else's face.

719
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:42,560
Hoping you wouldn't
feel the pain.

720
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:47,200
While we're talking,
do you have protection?

721
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:48,960
What? You mean
like condoms?

722
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,640
Protection.

723
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:02,840
Next time, let Karl
take his pants down.

724
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:06,400
Slip this in his thigh, twist
it so the wound won't close.

725
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:20,080
Now go on.
Get outta here.

726
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,360
l am the king.

727
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,360
Eve.

728
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:44,560
Jesus, Cas!
lt's me!

729
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:48,120
lt's me.

730
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:52,880
Cas. Shh.

731
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:58,080
Come on.
lt's me. Jesus.

732
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:02,960
Come on.

733
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:06,040
- Don't you wanna talk?
- The only talk l ever heard
from you is...

734
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:09,120
"Suck my tongue," "l love
your ass," and "See ya,"

735
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:12,240
and "Take the filthy shit off,"
"Put this on and get outta here."

736
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:15,280
- No, l'm not goin' anywhere.
- Oh, really?

737
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:17,120
What do you-- What do you
expect me, after all this time--

738
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:20,080
Just to-- Just to
jump on you?

739
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:22,160
- That's not what l--
- ls that what you expect?

740
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:24,000
- That's not what l meant.
- What did you mean?

741
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:27,440
- l meant--
- Huh? ls this what you meant?

742
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:30,920
That? That? How about this?
ls that good? Huh?

743
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:39,120
- Sean Archer.
- Bro.

744
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:42,160
Well, l figured he might drop in
on some of our old friends.

745
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:46,360
And if my eyes don't deceive,
l think this fellow's
beginning to enjoy being you.

746
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:49,280
Good.

747
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:59,200
Look, look, look. Okay.
L-Look, Sasha.

748
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:04,160
What l meant is, uh, that
l'm not going anywhere...

749
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:06,920
until your brother
helps me, uh, first.

750
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:12,640
Cas. lf the FBl finds out
that you were here,

751
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:15,320
l'll lose my son.

752
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:17,240
Please, Cas,
you just gotta go.

753
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:26,440
l've said and done some things
that have made your life harder.

754
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:29,040
- l know.
- How would you?

755
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:31,440
When you left,
you never looked back.

756
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,360
l-- l just know.

757
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:48,720
Look, Sasha, l'm not
the same person you remember.

758
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:51,160
And for what it's worth,
l'm sorry.

759
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:59,800
- They're nice-looking clothes.
- Yeah, of course. They're yours.

760
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:02,600
Look, l know, l--

761
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:04,760

762
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:09,520
That's a nice-lookin' kid too.

763
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:11,920
Yeah. Of course.

764
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:15,920
He's yours too.

765
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:36,640
- How old is he?
- Five.

766
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:40,720
Nobody knows he's yours.
l was...

767
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:44,160
scared someone would try
to hurt him just to hurt you.

768
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:46,840
Adam. Adam.

769
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:50,160
Don't want you playing with those
things. They are very, very dangerous.

770
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:54,360
Okay? Now come on, sweetie.

771
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:58,240
l want you to meet
your father.

772
01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:01,560
Look at him.
lt's okay. Say hi.

773
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:03,480
Hi.

774
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:21,560
Hi.

775
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:27,760
Michael.

776
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:30,760
- Michael. Michael?
- Cas.

777
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:33,840
- Cas. Cas, you're scaring him.
- Michael?

778
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:36,720
Let him go.

779
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:39,480
What is the matter
with you?

780
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:44,760
Get down!

781
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:58,080
Okay, Red Team!
Red Team, break off!

782
01:27:58,200 --> 01:28:01,480
How'd you get to be so brave?
How'd you get to be so brave?

783
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:06,000
- Come out now with your hands up!
- Put these on.

784
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:09,160
Okay. That's a good idea,
baby. Listen to your music.

785
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:10,800
- Come on.
- Come out now!

786
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:13,240
Somewhere

787
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:14,960
- Go! Go! Go!
- We have a warrant for your arrest!

788
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:19,160
Cops.

789
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:24,040
l hate cops.

790
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:26,520
Come on, kid.

791
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:37,840
- Move! Move!
- Go left, left!
First door to the right!

792
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:44,480
Go! Go! Go!

793
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:47,160
Go! Go!

794
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:02,320
Someday l'll wish
upon a star

795
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:05,320
- And wake up--
- Let's get outta here! Come on.

796
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:08,000
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

797
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:22,720
Damn, my place
is gettin' fucked up.

798
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:34,160
Take him.

799
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:46,040
Cas! Cas,
give me the boy!

800
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:52,960
Really? Really?
Come on! Shit!

801
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:57,160
Come on, come on!
Let's go! Go, go, go!

802
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:05,200
Cas, be careful
with him!

803
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:18,280
- Don't be scared, All right? All right?
- Somewhere

804
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:24,040
Over the rainbow

805
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:29,840
Skies are blue

806
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:35,440
And the dreams

807
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:39,480
That you dared to dream

808
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:45,560
Really do come true

809
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:49,360
Someday l'll wish
upon a star

810
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:52,280
And wake up
where the clouds

811
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:55,920
- Are far behind
- Adam!

812
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,400
Me

813
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:07,240
Birds fly over the rainbow

814
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:10,320
Why then, oh, why

815
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:14,480
Can't l

816
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:17,080
Adam! Adam!

817
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:20,960
Get him out back!
Go, go, go!

818
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:26,160
Put the boy down.

819
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:28,880
Honey, sweetie,
don't touch that.

820
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,480
lt isn't nice!

821
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:32,560
l don't ever
wanna see you do that.

822
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:38,120
They're like cockroaches!

823
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:40,080
Hey. Drop it.

824
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:43,360
That's it.

825
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:47,200
Buzz.

826
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:48,720
Hey!

827
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:55,600
Told him
not to fuck with me.

828
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:41,960
Take the boy
and get outta here.

829
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:43,880
- Are you all right?
- Go!

830
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:50,720
Hurry up.

831
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:58,760
Hey, man.

832
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:01,400
We had some good times,
didn't we?

833
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:39,080
l don't know what l hate
wearing worse:

834
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:41,320
your face or your body.

835
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:45,800
l mean, l enjoy
boning your wife,

836
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:47,760
but, uh, well,
let's face it.

837
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:51,960
We both like it better
the other way, yes?

838
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:54,000
So why don't we just
trade back.

839
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:56,360
You can't give back
what you've taken from me.

840
01:33:58,160 --> 01:34:02,280
Oh, well.
Plan "B."

841
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:04,360
Let's just kill each other.

842
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:06,000
Sir, why are you
so upset?

843
01:36:06,120 --> 01:36:08,480
lt's just Pollux Troy.

844
01:36:36,500 --> 01:36:40,220
Sir, look. You're
on the cover of Time.

845
01:36:40,340 --> 01:36:42,380
Listen. "ln a single week,
Agent Sean Archer...

846
01:36:42,460 --> 01:36:44,580
"has ordered a stunning series
of blitzkrieg-style raids...

847
01:36:44,660 --> 01:36:48,180
"on the hideouts, staging grounds and
safe houses of our nation's assassins.

848
01:36:48,300 --> 01:36:50,220
Car bombs--"

849
01:36:53,820 --> 01:36:57,420
Sean. Look we're friends,
so l'm gonna tell you face to face.

850
01:36:57,500 --> 01:37:00,140
l don't give a damn if you are
Time's Man of the Year.

851
01:37:00,260 --> 01:37:04,380
After last night's bloodbath,
l'm terminatin' your war on terrorists.

852
01:37:08,980 --> 01:37:13,740
ls that, uh, because l'm getting
all the kudos and you're not?

853
01:37:13,820 --> 01:37:16,300
Jesus Christ. l don't know where
you're gettin' your intelligence.

854
01:37:16,420 --> 01:37:20,380
lt's not from field agents.
Sometimes l think you know too much.

855
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:22,460
Washington's
starting to worry.

856
01:37:22,580 --> 01:37:26,700
Justice wants a hearing.
Shoot.

857
01:37:26,780 --> 01:37:29,660
They're concerned
about the constitutionality
of your gestapo tactics!

858
01:37:29,780 --> 01:37:32,060
And frankly,
so am l! l'm--

859
01:37:34,380 --> 01:37:36,340
Uh, okay, Victor,

860
01:37:36,460 --> 01:37:40,140
l'll give the, uh,
taxpayers a break.

861
01:37:40,260 --> 01:37:42,140
But, um,

862
01:37:44,340 --> 01:37:47,500
l have something, uh,
l want to confess.

863
01:37:47,620 --> 01:37:50,660
And l don't think
you're gonna like it.

864
01:37:50,740 --> 01:37:53,060
l am Castor Troy.

865
01:38:03,780 --> 01:38:06,660
- Kimmy. Kim?
- Yes, sir.

866
01:38:06,740 --> 01:38:09,940
Call the paramedics. Victor
Lazarro's had a heart attack.

867
01:38:10,060 --> 01:38:12,140
- Oh, God. Right away.
- Thank you.

868
01:38:36,940 --> 01:38:38,780
Home.

869
01:39:01,340 --> 01:39:03,180
Eve.

870
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:07,260
Eve.

871
01:39:07,340 --> 01:39:09,900
No. Honey, please,
please don't scream.

872
01:39:09,980 --> 01:39:11,820
Don't scream.
l'm not gonna hurt you.

873
01:39:11,900 --> 01:39:14,420
Okay, just don't,
don't, don't, don't.

874
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:16,540
Just don't--
don't look at my face.

875
01:39:16,660 --> 01:39:19,700
And the voice.
Don't listen.

876
01:39:19,780 --> 01:39:22,860
- Just--
- l know who you are!
You killed our son!

877
01:39:22,980 --> 01:39:25,500
l did not kill our son.

878
01:39:25,620 --> 01:39:27,420
l'm Sean.

879
01:39:32,340 --> 01:39:35,060
The last time l saw you...

880
01:39:35,140 --> 01:39:37,060
was in this room.

881
01:39:37,180 --> 01:39:40,660
We had a fight when l said
l had to go away again.

882
01:39:40,740 --> 01:39:43,700
And l spent the night
in Mike's old bed.

883
01:39:56,340 --> 01:39:58,820
l'm tired, Eve.

884
01:39:58,940 --> 01:40:03,340
The assignment was to enter
a federal prison as Castor Troy.

885
01:40:03,460 --> 01:40:06,300
lt's just fucking insane.

886
01:40:06,380 --> 01:40:10,300
And it's-- A special ops
surgeon, uh, gave me, uh,

887
01:40:10,420 --> 01:40:12,340
Castor's face!

888
01:40:14,980 --> 01:40:18,500
Then, uh-- And then, somehow,
Castor came out of his, uh,

889
01:40:20,220 --> 01:40:24,700
his-his coma, and
he killed everybody...

890
01:40:24,780 --> 01:40:26,940
who knew about the mission.

891
01:40:27,060 --> 01:40:30,660
But, but not before
transforming into me.

892
01:40:51,780 --> 01:40:55,460
l know you don't believe a word
l'm saying. Well, here's proof, Doctor.

893
01:40:55,580 --> 01:40:59,260
Your husband, me, my,
Sean's blood type is O-negative.

894
01:40:59,380 --> 01:41:01,980
Castor's is AB.

895
01:41:10,900 --> 01:41:13,420
And l love you.

896
01:41:26,820 --> 01:41:28,660
Get some backup.

897
01:41:33,100 --> 01:41:35,540
What a day.

898
01:41:38,780 --> 01:41:41,460
You look tense.

899
01:41:45,660 --> 01:41:49,820
l know l've been acting
different lately. Strange.

900
01:41:51,260 --> 01:41:54,820
l've got a confession
to make, Eve.

901
01:41:54,940 --> 01:41:57,820
You're not gonna like it.

902
01:41:57,900 --> 01:42:01,220
Oh, Eve. l feel--
l feel so close to you.

903
01:42:02,660 --> 01:42:05,940
l read your diary. l know
l shouldn't have. l'm ashamed.

904
01:42:06,020 --> 01:42:08,020
But l did.

905
01:42:08,100 --> 01:42:10,620
l just wanna be the man
that you deserve--

906
01:42:10,740 --> 01:42:13,220
passionate, tender.

907
01:42:17,180 --> 01:42:20,780
Victor Lazarro died today.
He had a heart seizure.

908
01:42:20,900 --> 01:42:23,620
My mentor, gone.

909
01:42:24,940 --> 01:42:27,300
First Tito, then Victor.
So what?

910
01:42:29,940 --> 01:42:32,620
l hope this doesn't mean
l'm losing you.

911
01:42:32,740 --> 01:42:34,540
Of course not.

912
01:42:42,140 --> 01:42:44,660
You're the only family
l've got.

913
01:43:32,940 --> 01:43:34,780
Oh, God.

914
01:43:38,660 --> 01:43:43,060
- Oh, God.
- l was hoping you'd come here.

915
01:43:43,140 --> 01:43:45,780
Thank you for trusting me.

916
01:43:48,260 --> 01:43:53,300
Right now,
l don't trust anyone.

917
01:43:53,380 --> 01:43:56,340
Eve, wh-where'd
you get that gun?

918
01:43:56,420 --> 01:43:58,540
l took it
from my fake husband.

919
01:43:58,660 --> 01:44:01,780
Put it down.
You know l'm Sean.

920
01:44:01,860 --> 01:44:05,380
Do l? Maybe Sean's
already dead, huh?

921
01:44:05,500 --> 01:44:08,300
l'm moving very slowly.

922
01:44:30,380 --> 01:44:33,740
l was thinking
the other day, l--

923
01:44:33,860 --> 01:44:35,660
l remember...

924
01:44:35,780 --> 01:44:38,780
l once took a date out...

925
01:44:38,900 --> 01:44:40,900
for surf and turf,

926
01:44:41,020 --> 01:44:44,820
not knowing she was
a vegetarian.

927
01:44:44,900 --> 01:44:49,260
So she ate bread.

928
01:44:49,380 --> 01:44:52,460
And, uh, and broke her tooth
on a rye seed.

929
01:44:55,900 --> 01:44:59,100
And we, we drove around
all night,

930
01:44:59,220 --> 01:45:03,060
uh, looking for a--
for a all-night dentist.

931
01:45:03,140 --> 01:45:06,540
And, and he, uh--
He was so drunk,

932
01:45:06,660 --> 01:45:09,100
he fixed the wrong tooth.

933
01:45:14,820 --> 01:45:18,300
And it-- When l
finally brought her home--

934
01:45:21,380 --> 01:45:26,540
Even though it must have
hurt like hell,

935
01:45:26,660 --> 01:45:30,100
you, you, you kissed me.

936
01:45:41,420 --> 01:45:44,940
Sean,

937
01:45:45,060 --> 01:45:48,740
that man--

938
01:45:48,860 --> 01:45:52,020
You know we've been living
together as man and wife for a week.

939
01:45:52,100 --> 01:45:54,820
Yeah, l--

940
01:45:54,940 --> 01:45:59,380
l know.
Eve. Eve.

941
01:45:59,460 --> 01:46:02,300
l put you
in that position and, and--

942
01:46:02,380 --> 01:46:05,020
l-l-l can never
make it up to you.

943
01:46:11,620 --> 01:46:14,180
Well, you're damn well
gonna try.

944
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:17,020
Let me take a look at that wound
before you bleed to death.

945
01:46:24,300 --> 01:46:26,460
With Lazarro out of the way,

946
01:46:26,580 --> 01:46:29,500
Castor's the new acting director
of the Bureau.

947
01:46:29,580 --> 01:46:32,700
- He's untouchable.
- Not tomorrow.

948
01:46:32,820 --> 01:46:34,900
Tomorrow he'll
be at Victor's service.

949
01:46:34,980 --> 01:46:38,460
Tomorrow.

950
01:46:38,540 --> 01:46:40,860
That will be the day.

951
01:46:44,380 --> 01:46:46,860
l want you and Jamie away from
there. Give him a good excuse.

952
01:46:46,940 --> 01:46:48,780
l can cover for Jamie,

953
01:46:48,900 --> 01:46:50,940
but if l'm not coming he's
gonna know that something's up.

954
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:55,380
And besides, l'm the only one
who can try and explain the truth.

955
01:46:57,220 --> 01:47:00,140
Excuse me, Mr Archer.
May l help you?

956
01:47:00,220 --> 01:47:02,300
Dr Levine to X Ray.

957
01:47:13,780 --> 01:47:16,260
Sean, what are you
doing here?

958
01:47:21,460 --> 01:47:24,100
Sorry, darling, it--

959
01:47:24,220 --> 01:47:27,540
l just get so,
so jealous, l--

960
01:47:27,620 --> 01:47:30,220
l mean, wh-wh-what is a guy
to think when his, uh,

961
01:47:30,300 --> 01:47:32,140
his wife runs off
in the middle of the night?

962
01:47:32,220 --> 01:47:35,340
That l'm a doctor that's on call,
so please let me get back to work, okay?

963
01:47:35,420 --> 01:47:37,260
Sorry.

964
01:47:40,540 --> 01:47:44,540
Lies, distrust,
mixed messages.

965
01:47:44,660 --> 01:47:46,500
This is turning
into a real marriage.

966
01:48:06,300 --> 01:48:10,020
How's Adam?

967
01:48:10,140 --> 01:48:13,340
l took him over to my cousin's
until this whole thing blows over.

968
01:48:13,460 --> 01:48:15,860
- Where's Jamie?
- That's what l'd like to know.

969
01:48:15,940 --> 01:48:18,620
She stole $50 from my purse
and took off.

970
01:48:20,820 --> 01:48:24,820
- So what's the next move?
- This isn't your fight.

971
01:48:24,940 --> 01:48:28,340
Oh, come on. You're surprised?
Our daughter won't even
visit Michael's grave.

972
01:48:28,420 --> 01:48:30,780
You think she gives a damn
about your boss?

973
01:48:36,220 --> 01:48:40,180
He killed my brother. l'm not
gonna let him take you too.

974
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:58,900
Whatever happens,
l promise...

975
01:48:58,980 --> 01:49:01,580
Sean Archer is
off your back for good.

976
01:49:14,740 --> 01:49:18,500
My dear friends, we are here
to celebrate the life of Victor Lazarro.

977
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:48,980
Somebody back there asked me
to give this to you.

978
01:51:10,300 --> 01:51:12,820
ln peace now, let us take
our brother Victor...

979
01:51:12,940 --> 01:51:14,940
to his place of rest.

980
01:51:59,700 --> 01:52:01,660
lsn't this religious?

981
01:52:04,700 --> 01:52:09,180
Ah, yes. The eternal battle
between good and evil,

982
01:52:09,300 --> 01:52:11,100
saint and sinner.

983
01:52:11,220 --> 01:52:13,580
But you're still
not having any fun!

984
01:52:22,780 --> 01:52:24,740
Honey? Honey?

985
01:52:27,180 --> 01:52:29,220
Come here.

986
01:52:32,180 --> 01:52:36,180
And guess what.
Your daughter's on the way.

987
01:52:36,260 --> 01:52:38,660
History repeats itself.

988
01:52:44,380 --> 01:52:47,860
This is between us.
Leave them out of it.

989
01:52:47,980 --> 01:52:52,420
No, you should've
left them out of it.

990
01:52:52,540 --> 01:52:55,900
Your son was an accident.
l wanted to kill you.

991
01:52:58,580 --> 01:53:01,580
But you took it
so personally.

992
01:53:01,660 --> 01:53:05,100
Why didn't you just
kill yourself or let it go?

993
01:53:05,180 --> 01:53:08,140
- No father could.
- No brother could either.

994
01:53:08,220 --> 01:53:11,100
Neither could a sister.

995
01:53:11,220 --> 01:53:13,140
Hey, baby.

996
01:53:16,380 --> 01:53:19,220
Sasha, what the fuck
are you doing here?

997
01:53:19,340 --> 01:53:21,260
Gee, Archer, l guess
l'm crashing.

998
01:53:21,340 --> 01:53:25,740
- You okay, baby?
- Yeah. Thanks.

999
01:53:25,820 --> 01:53:27,860
Sasha, baby.

1000
01:53:27,980 --> 01:53:30,500
l'm Castor.
That's Archer.

1001
01:53:30,620 --> 01:53:33,420
And l'm bored.

1002
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:37,060
- Put the fucking gun down.
- Why don't you put your guns down?

1003
01:53:43,740 --> 01:53:46,060
What a predicament!

1004
01:54:41,900 --> 01:54:44,140
Take care of our boy.

1005
01:54:45,340 --> 01:54:47,700
You love him so much.

1006
01:54:47,820 --> 01:54:51,020
Don't let him grow up
to be like us, promise?

1007
01:54:53,180 --> 01:54:55,060
- Yeah.
- Say yeah.

1008
01:55:23,460 --> 01:55:24,980
Mom?

1009
01:55:43,220 --> 01:55:44,940
Jamie!

1010
01:55:50,100 --> 01:55:52,740
Jamie, don't!

1011
01:55:59,300 --> 01:56:01,540
Hello, Wanda?

crazy to tell you.

1013
01:56:22,220 --> 01:56:25,700
lt's a capital crime to try to kill
the next big boss of the FBl, yes?

1014
01:56:25,780 --> 01:56:27,780
- Yes.
- Ah, yes.

1015
01:56:27,860 --> 01:56:29,900
- The penalty--

1016
01:56:30,020 --> 01:56:31,980
The penalty is death!

1017
01:56:42,820 --> 01:56:44,940
Die. Please, God, die.

1018
01:56:45,020 --> 01:56:47,300

01:56:47,380 --> 01:56:49,500
Good girl, Jamie!

Honey, don't listen to him,

Don't listen to him!
Don't shoot! Just, just--

1023
01:56:58,020 --> 01:57:01,780
This scumbag-- This scumbag shot

1024
01:57:04,820 --> 01:57:06,900
Clod.

1025
01:57:07,020 --> 01:57:10,860
No daughter of mine
would shoot so wide.

1026
01:57:10,940 --> 01:57:14,820
Dad, put the gun down.
Put it down.

1027
01:57:16,460 --> 01:57:18,900
Dad, put it down.

1028
01:57:19,020 --> 01:57:23,220
Now we're gonna find out
what's in Papa's bag. Peaches.

1029
01:57:28,220 --> 01:57:30,220
Say goodbye to Papa.

1030
01:57:31,680 --> 01:57:33,980
Jamie!

1031
01:57:39,860 --> 01:57:43,660
Jamie! Jamie! Jamie,
are you all right? Oh, my God.

1032
01:57:44,820 --> 01:57:46,500
Sir, are you okay?

1033
01:57:55,500 --> 01:57:58,500
Please, someone please tell me
what planet l'm on?

1034
01:58:12,860 --> 01:58:14,900
Get down!

1035
01:59:25,980 --> 01:59:27,540
Stop! This is the police!

1036
01:59:27,660 --> 01:59:30,780
Stop immediately or we'll
be forced to open fire!

1037
01:59:31,740 --> 01:59:34,140
Fire! Fire!

1038
02:03:50,700 --> 02:03:53,980
You're right, Sean.
l've misbehaved.

1039
02:03:54,060 --> 02:03:55,740
l need to be punished.

1040
02:04:00,900 --> 02:04:03,380
But remember,
every time...

1041
02:04:03,500 --> 02:04:06,780
you look in the mirror,
you'll see my face.

1042
02:04:23,180 --> 02:04:25,380
Die!

1043
02:04:42,980 --> 02:04:45,580
Ready

1044
02:04:45,700 --> 02:04:49,140
Ready for the big ride

1045
02:04:49,260 --> 02:04:51,780
Baby

1046
02:04:55,860 --> 02:04:58,340
Off of Pico in the middle
of the street.

1047
02:05:05,460 --> 02:05:07,420
You okay, Archer?

1048
02:05:11,460 --> 02:05:14,620
- What did you call me?
- He called you Archer, sir.

1049
02:05:28,140 --> 02:05:33,100
Sean, they're bringing in
their top surgical team from DC.
You're going to be okay.

1050
02:06:18,220 --> 02:06:20,780
When you wake up,
everything will be restored...

1051
02:06:20,900 --> 02:06:23,460
just the way it was.

1052
02:06:25,100 --> 02:06:30,260
My scar.
The one near my heart.

1053
02:06:30,380 --> 02:06:33,060
This old bullet wound.

1054
02:06:33,180 --> 02:06:35,500
- l won't need it any more.
- Okay.

1055
02:07:31,420 --> 02:07:34,460
Dad?

1056
02:07:46,020 --> 02:07:48,620
Dad?

1057
02:07:48,740 --> 02:07:52,060
l'm sorry l shot you.

1058
02:07:59,980 --> 02:08:03,260
l've got something
l have to ask both of you.

1059
02:08:13,500 --> 02:08:16,100
This is, um, Adam.

1060
02:08:16,220 --> 02:08:20,100
And he needs
a place to live.

1061
02:08:20,220 --> 02:08:24,820
Hi. My name's Jamie.

1062

1063
02:08:28,660 --> 02:08:30,940
Why don't you show Adam

1064
02:08:31,020 --> 02:08:34,140
Come on.

1065
02:08:34,220 --> 02:08:36,060
Okay.
