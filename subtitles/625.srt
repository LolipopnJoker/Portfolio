Amelia, have you ever heard of
Edward Christof Philippe Gérard Renaldi?

173
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:10,414
No.

174
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:13,625
He was the Crown Prince of Genovia.

175
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,335
Mm.

176
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,589
What about him?

177
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:21,550
Edward Christof Philippe
Gérard Renaldi...

178
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,596
...was your father.
- [Scoffs]

179
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:29,892
Yeah, sure.
My father was the Prince of Genovia.

180
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,186
Uh-huh. You're joking.

181
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:35,606
Why would I joke about
something like that?

182
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:40,110
No. No, 'cause if he's really
a prince, then I'm...

183
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:43,238
Exactly.
You're not just Amelia Thermopolis,

184
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:48,285
you are Amelia Mignonette
Thermopolis Renaldi,

185
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,621
Princess of Genovia.

186
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,502
Me? A... A princess?

187
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,879
Shut up!

188
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,591
I beg your pardon? Shut up?

189
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,928
Your Majesty, in America
it doesn't always mean "be quiet."

190
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:10,933
- It could mean "wow", "gee whiz"...
- I understand, thank you.

191
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,936
Nevertheless, you are the Princess.

192
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:18,273
And I am Queen Clarisse Renaldi.

193
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,110
Why on earth would you
pick me to be your princess?

194
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:26,490
Since your father died, you are
the natural heir to the throne.

195
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:28,659
That's our law.

196
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:33,121
I'm royal by marriage.
You are royal by blood.

197
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,332
You can rule.

198
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:40,879
Rule? Oh, no.
Oh, no. No, no, no.

199
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:44,341
Now you have really got the wrong girl.
I never lead anybody.

200
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:47,844
Not at Brownies,
not at Campfire Girls...

201
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,266
Queen Clarisse, my expectation in life
is to be invisible

202
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,725
and I'm good at it.

203
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,812
Amelia, I had other expectations, also.

204
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,190
In my wildest dreams, I never
expected this to happen,

205
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:04,027
but you are the legal heir, the
only heir to the Genovian throne

206
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:09,533
and we will accept the challenge of
helping you become the princess you are.

207
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:10,867
I can give you books.

208
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:14,246
You'll study languages,
history, art, political science.

209
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:19,418
I can teach you to walk, talk,
sit, stand, eat, dress like a princess.

210
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:23,130
Given time, I think you'll find
the palace a pleasant place to live.

211
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:25,674
- Live in Genovia?
- It's a wonderful country, really.

212
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:30,637
Whoa, whoa! Ju...
Rewind and freeze. I'm no princess.

213
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:34,099
I'm still waiting for
normal body parts to arrive.

214
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,768
I refuse to move to,
and rule, a country,

215
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:41,189
and do you want another reason?
I don't want to be a princess.

216
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,817
[Stammering] Amelia! Amelia!

217
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,695
Amelia! Come back here.

218
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:50,866
[Clarisse groans]

219
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,746
Well, that went well, didn't it?

220
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,248
- Perhaps she needs more time.
- Will you help me?

221
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,084
Miss Thermopolis...

222
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,006
I'm head of your security and you want
me to be a chauffeur and babysitter?

223
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,383
For the time being, yes.
The child needs protection.

224
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:18,226
[Mia] For 15 years, you couldn't
find a spare minute

225
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,395
to tell me that my father is a royal?

226
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,856
- I thought I was doing the right thing.
- Oh.

227
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:26,151
- The right thing for who, Mom?
- All of us.

228
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:30,197
If we secretly divorced,
he would be able to find a woman

229
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:32,824
who'd stay by his side in Genovia
and produce heirs.

230
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,826
And I'd be free
to live my life with you.

231
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,412
I mean, please, we met in college.

232
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,500
I was young. I wanted to paint.

233
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:45,337
Can you see me walking one step
behind someone for the rest of my life?

234
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:49,841
With rules, regulations, waving,
bowing and scraping. I was scared.

235
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,887
Living with a mother who lied to me
for 15 years scares me.

236
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:57,599
- Where are you going?
- Straighten up the royal bed chamber.

237
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:03,063
[Mother] After the divorce,
we all discussed it.

238
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:07,275
Your father and your grandmother
both agreed to keep their distance,

239
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,778
so you would have a chance
of a normal childhood.

240
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:12,572
Free of emotional complications.

241
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,866
We were going to tell you
when you were 18.

242
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,828
But when your father died,
things changed, Mia.

243
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,289
We wanted to protect you.

244
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,335
OK, you know what?

245
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,838
I don't feel protected.

246
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,716
You try living for 15 years
thinking you're one person

247
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:34,010
and in five minutes you find out
you're a princess.

248
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:38,098
Just in case I'm not enough
of a freak already, let's add a tiara.

249
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,644
[Sighs] Well...

250
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:45,313
...drink your soup.
- I'm not really hungry.

251
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:48,525
Fine. Good night, sweetheart.

252
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:56,742
Fat Louie... you are so lucky you
don't know who your parents are.

253
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:06,793
I've never ridden in a limo,
he admitted bitterly to himself

254
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:11,339
as he crossed to the open window
and looked out at the bay.

255
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,134
The fog looming
like his pathetic life before him.

256
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:16,219
I can't believe I won an Emmy.

257
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:20,348
I have this favorite photo of Philippe.

258
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,559
We had so much fun here in college.

259
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:27,647
He was so full of joie de vivre,
always laughing and smiling.

260
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:28,815
I remember.

261
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:33,445
Helen, if Amelia refuses
to accept the throne,

262
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:36,656
Genovia will cease to exist
as we know it.

263
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:41,203
So the future of your country
is in the hands of my 15 year old?

264
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,837
Here it is.

265
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,256
Mm.

266
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,092
Ohh.

267
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,887
Philippe was ready to be king.

268
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,809
Then the terrible accident.

269
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:08,814
Even though it didn't work out
between us,

270
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,984
- I loved your son very much.
- Thank you.

271
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:18,698
Well, as always,
this is as good as it's gonna get.

272
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:24,830
I can't wait until she's 18.

273
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:27,833
[Sighs]

274
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,377
Oh, this is a nightmare.
I'm going back to bed.

275
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:33,672
Mia, the three of us have to talk.

276
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,842
Oh, OK. Is there something else
about me and my life

277
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,427
that I might want to know about?

278
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,763
Oh, no. Are you two waiting
to take me on a talk show

279
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,516
to let me know I have a twin sister
who's a duchess?

280
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,476
You have a cousin who's a contessa.

281
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:50,313
Fondly known as Bartholomew.
Actually, we call him Pookie.

282
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:56,278
Yesterday did not go well.
Will you listen to your grandmother?

283
00:19:56,988 --> 00:20:02,117
Amelia, in a matter of weeks
we have an annual ball.

284
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:05,036
I was... I am hoping

285
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,707
that I may present you to the press
and the public on that occasion.

286
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,793
However, you desperately need
some instruction.

287
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:16,172
I speak for the entire Genovian
parliament and the royal family.

288
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,216
And I speak for this family.

289
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:21,887
Excuse me. I don't have a family
with either one of you,

290
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:26,474
because you ignored me for 15 years
and you lied to me.

291
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:30,228
Families don't do stuff like that
to one another, OK?

292
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:36,735
- Where is she going?
- The tower.

293
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:41,197
- Mia, you can't run from everything.
- She has a tower?

294
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,618
Please, just come down from there.

295
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:49,456
Most kids hope for a car for their
16th birthday, not a country.

296
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,000
Just make yourself comfortable.

297
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,044
- [Hissing]
- Oh!

298
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:57,422
[Helen] This is getting us nowhere.
Talk to me.

299
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:01,927
I can't, I'm late for a meeting
with my guidance counselor.

300
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:05,013
I'm late for a meeting
with Spain and Portugal.

301
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,724
[Helen] I have a thought.

302
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:12,312
Mia promises to attend princess lessons
until your ball.

303
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,400
It's not my ball, it's Genovia's
Annual Independence Day Ball.

304
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:19,444
I'm sorry.

305
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:22,280
Mia promises neither
to accept nor reject

306
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:25,825
your offer to be royal
until this grand ball.

307
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,286
Then she makes her decision.

308
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,538
Now can you both live with that?

309
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:40,924
It seems I have no option.

310
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:43,551
If I have to.

311
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:48,056
But I want not one word of this
until that evening, is that understood?

312
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:49,391
Duh.

313
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,601
[Clarisse] The press
would have a field day.

314
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:56,398
Well, let's not keep Spain
and Portugal waiting.

315
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,400
I'm gonna be 16 this year,

316
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,945
and my mom traded two paintings
to get me a 1966 Mustang.

317
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:04,990
- You know what a Mustang is, right?
- I raise mustangs.

318
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,409
That is not a sensible car
for a princess.

319
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:10,328
It's not a sensible car for anyone.
It doesn't run.

320
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:13,665
I suppose I could donate
something to this vehicle.

321
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:17,419
- [Mia] Good morning, Mr. Robutusen.
- [Clarisse] Who is this gentleman?

322
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,671
My neighbor,
but you wouldn't want to meet him.

323
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,715
He doesn't have very nice manners.

324
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:22,924
Good morning.

325
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:26,803
- There's someone I want you to meet.
- OK. Whoa.

326
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,931
- You have two limousines?
- One is yours.

327
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:32,392
- You raise limousines, too?
- No.

328
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,145
- Amelia, this is Joseph.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

329
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:38,314
The elegant European woman
didn't stay for tea.

330
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,316
Thanks.

331
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:43,737
But the promise of tomorrow
hung in the air.

332
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,203
Ooh!

333
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:02,547
Uh, Princess?

334
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:06,509
May I point out that,
no matter how many times you push it,

335
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:09,262
- it will go up and down the same way.
- Oh.

336
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:13,349
Joseph, can we 86 the flags, please?

337
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:17,312
No. The flags allow me

00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:34,095
It's Hermès.
The scarf is merely a training tool.

504
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:38,099
Eventually you'll learn to sit
and eat properly without it.

505
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:41,686
Manners matter.

506
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,605

with Spain,

- so we prepare for that.
- Sorry.

509
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:53,155
The quickest way
to a Spanish heart is dance.

What kind of dancing do you do?

511
00:33:56,451 --> 00:34:00,329

Straight, straight, straight up.
Let's practice this here.

519
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:27,481

a waltz and a tango. You see?

520
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,567
- It's a wango?
- No.

521

- Yes.
- I spun without hurting anyone.

530

672
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:09,831
Mama Mia!

673
00:45:09,999 --> 00:45:13,293
- Look who's trying to fit in now.
- It's a wig, right?

674
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:15,545
I think it looks really sweet, Mia.

675
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,923
[Girl] Looks like she got a head
transplant.

676
00:45:18,091 --> 00:45:20,967
Well, I think it rocks,
and you know what?

677
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:23,720
Voltaire, hair.

678
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:27,933
I would personally
like to learn about Voltaire.

679
00:45:28,101 --> 00:45:29,267
OK, Lilly. OK.

680
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:33,522
OK, everybody settle down now.
Quiz time, OK?

681
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:37,234
[Clarisse] The roses are lovely,
but now we need fountains,

682
00:45:37,402 --> 00:45:38,902
lights in the trees.

683
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:42,864
The Japanese Embassy has a waterfall,
why can't we have fountains?

684
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:47,327
- We have a fountain up there.
- I would like at least two in here.

685
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:50,414
- Charlotte, just make me an Eden.
- Yes, ma'am.

686
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,457
Mm.

687
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:54,459
- Amelia, let's continue.
- Hm?

688
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,922
[Clarisse] In your spare time,
I would like you to read these.

689
00:45:59,132 --> 00:46:00,424
"What's in a name?

690
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:03,885
That which we call a rose by
any other word would smell as sweet."

691
00:46:04,053 --> 00:46:07,055
And so, you wave to them
and acknowledge them gracefully.

692
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:08,265
- Hello.
- No, no.

693
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:12,686
Not quite so big,
it's very exhausting after awhile.

694
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:16,440
Very funny, dear. Try it properly.

695
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,984
Waving, even more gently.

696
00:46:19,152 --> 00:46:22,154
You sort of say,
thank you for being here today.

697
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:24,239
- Thank you.
- Thank you for being here.

698
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:28,285
I'm sorry, ma'am. I must pick up
the Prime Minister. Excuse me.

699
00:46:28,453 --> 00:46:30,787
[Both] Thank you for being here today.

700
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:35,917
[Mia] So, this is considered art.

701
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:39,296
My parents did this in the '60s.

702
00:46:39,464 --> 00:46:42,674
Yes!
They had an exhibition at Woodstock.

703
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:45,802
I guess you're trying to bring it back?

704
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:48,472
Well, yeah, this beats homework.

705
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,934
Some moms help their kids
with homework, you do this.

706
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:55,395
[Mia] Oh, nice shot.

707
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:57,147
[Helen] Yes, I like it.

708
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:58,523
Bull's-eye.

709
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,610
[Both shouting]

710
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:10,118
This is more fun than princess lessons.

711
00:47:12,914 --> 00:47:14,831
What're you doing Saturday night?

712
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:16,958
Oh, are you guys playing?

713
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:19,794
Rehearsing some new things.
We got two new songs.

714
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,505
Oh yeah?

715
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:24,716
Plus, surprise,
we got the new parts for your 'stang.

716
00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:26,510
Oh, yay!

717
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:30,055
- We could put it together, together.
- OK, well, uh,

718
00:47:30,223 --> 00:47:32,807
- is this like a date?
- No.

719
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:37,562
- Music, cars...
- Would it include pizza?

720
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:39,147
Of course, pizza's a given.

721
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:42,025
- With M&M's?
- Wait up! Wait up for me.

722
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:44,110
Not you, I don't even know you.

723
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:47,614
- Well, then I am in.
- Great.

724
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:50,659
- Saturday, it's on.
- Yeah, great. Hi.

725
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:53,370
- Hey, Lill. What's up?
- [Men shout indistinctly]

726
00:47:53,538 --> 00:47:55,455
- What's happening over there?
- I don't know.

727
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:57,165
[Chattering]

728
00:47:57,333 --> 00:48:00,544
- [Mia] What's going on? Maybe.
- Maybe it's a protest.

729
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:03,797
Excuse me. Hi.
Who are you all waiting for?

730
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:05,882
There she is.
That's Mia Thermopolis.

731
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:09,010
- We're waiting for you.
- Right here, Princess.

732
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:11,304
- Lilly, did you tell?
- I didn't say anything.

733
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:12,806
- [Clamoring]
- Princess Mia,

734
00:48:12,974 --> 00:48:14,391
who is your favorite actor?

735
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:16,101
- Why are they calling her princess?
- Mia!

736
00:48:16,269 --> 00:48:20,522
- What do you do about pimples?
- Come on, let's just go.

737
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:22,399
[All clamoring]

738
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:26,570
Come on, Mia.
Let's get inside.

739
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:31,157
- [Girls] Ohh.
- Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

740
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:32,993
[Girls chattering]

741
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:36,913
- The phone's ringing off the hook.
- What?

742
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:39,374
Oh.

743
00:48:39,834 --> 00:48:42,627
[Patrick] Mia, your mother's on her way.

744
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:45,255
- [Telephone rings]
- Gupta.

745
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:47,924
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

746
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:50,010
Mm-hm.

747
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:54,097
The Queen is coming.
To Grove High School.

748
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:57,642
[Woman] A limo with flags.

749
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:59,603
[Man] The Genovian limousine
has arrived.

750
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,646
The Queen is getting out.

751
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,274
Why all the secrets?

752
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:07,944
All we keep hearing is "no comment."
Do you have a comment?

753
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:10,614
[Overlapping chatter]

754
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:13,617
Are you taking the Princess home?

755
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:18,663
Mom, I don't know who told on me.

756
00:49:18,831 --> 00:49:20,790
We'll get to the bottom of this.

757
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:24,461
Here's your tea, your Majesty.
I'm sorry we don't have finer china.

758
00:49:24,629 --> 00:49:27,005
- It's perfectly all right.
- Here.

759
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:30,300
Joseph.

760
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:36,056
- [Joe] Speak.
- Paolo?

761
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:39,559
Majesty. It was I who told the press.

762
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:42,562
I outed you, so to speak.
I don't mean to imply...

763
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:43,813
[foreign language]

764
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:47,525
But not for money.
Paolo hates money, he spits on money.

765
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:50,445
There was no money.
Well, there was some money.

766
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:52,822
A man like me. Each ring is...

767
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:56,993
The point is it was pride and ego
that drove me to know

768
00:49:57,161 --> 00:50:00,246
that royalty would see one day
the beauty was mine,

769
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:01,581
the hair was mine.

770
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:04,584
That I, Paolo Puttanesca,
was responsible...

771
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:06,878
[both speaking Italian]

772
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:12,384
By the way, your hair, magnificent.
Next time we go lighter.

773
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:16,179
- Would you like to say anything?
- Isn't that just awful?

774
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:19,015
Doesn't anyone
respect royalty anymore?

775
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:22,686
What is it like in Genovia,
Your Majesty?

776
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:25,063
Do people just fawn over you?

777
00:50:25,231 --> 00:50:28,733
I wonder, would you give us
a moment alone?

778
00:50:28,901 --> 00:50:33,071
- I'm the vice principal.
- Would you take this fine educator,

779
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:37,075
and show her your security plans
for Amelia's safety?

780
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:39,119
What?

781
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:42,872
- Ah, yes, of course.
- Your Majesty. Thank you.

782
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,376
- Your security system is a bit lax.
- Is it?

783
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:48,920
[Helen] A week ago,
Mia was a normal, little kid.

784
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:52,465
She has never been normal,
she was born royal.

785
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:56,010
We cope with the press every single day,
and we will do it again.

786
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:58,430
You don't have to do this.

787
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:01,808
You can get out of
this whole thing right now.

788
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:04,894
Your mother is right.
We had a bargain.

789
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:12,777
All right. I will think about it
and let you know soon.

790
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:15,280
Good. A diplomatic answer.

791
00:51:15,448 --> 00:51:18,575
Polite but vague.

792
00:51:18,743 --> 00:51:23,288
Mia is the daughter of local
eclectic artist, Helen Thermopolis.

793
00:51:23,456 --> 00:51:27,250
They currently live in a refurbished
firehouse south of Market Street.

794
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:31,087
Mia is also the only grandchild
of Queen Clarisse Renaldi.

795
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:34,424
Whose husband, King Rupert,
passed away last year.

796
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:37,260
This is Nelson Davenport, KRLH.

797
00:51:38,471 --> 00:51:40,096
[School bell rings]

798
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,142
[Woman over PA] Will the Feng Shui Club

799
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:47,270
please stop rearranging the tables
on the lawn.

800
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:51,399
Hello, princess!
You're the most popular girl in school,

801
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:54,944
everybody wants to take your picture,
and be your best friend.

802
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:57,614
- Hi, Lilly.
- Hi. So you know what?

803
00:51:57,782 --> 00:52:01,201
I've made a list of all the reasons
for you not to be a princess.

804
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:03,495
Number one, no privacy.

805
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:06,456
Number two, you always
have to look just right.

806
00:52:06,624 --> 00:52:07,957
- Number three...
- Whoo!

807
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,959
[Mia laughing heartily]

808
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:12,253
Are you OK?

809
00:52:12,421 --> 00:52:15,381
- What was number three?
- OK, number three:

810
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:18,802
You can't go nutso.
You can't be all blah during the day.

811
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,595
Lilly, Lilly, um,

812
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:23,389
I really don't want to talk
about this at the moment.

813
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:24,808
- OK?
- OK.

814
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,435
One last question.
Now that you're "out,"

815
00:52:27,603 --> 00:52:29,395
would you come on my cable show
Saturday night?

816
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:32,732
- Yeah, sure.
- I love you.

817
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:36,820
I'm going to buy you another charm
for your charm bracelet. OK? OK.

818
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,363
See you Saturday night.

819
00:52:38,531 --> 00:52:40,323
Joe!

820
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:45,578
Yes, Miss Mia.

821
00:52:45,746 --> 00:52:49,582
I don't want to run my own country.
I just want to pass tenth grade.

822
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:54,254
So... can't I tell everyone
I simply quit?

823
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:58,049
No one can quit being who they are,
not even a princess.

824
00:52:58,217 --> 00:53:01,803
You can refuse the job,
but you are a princess by birth.

825
00:53:01,971 --> 00:53:03,847
How can I tell if I can even do the job?

826
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,140
By simply trying.

827
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:10,520
Like the fancy dinner coming up.
She thinks you're ready.

828
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:12,355
Really?

829
00:53:12,982 --> 00:53:15,567
Shall we practice entering
like a princess?

830
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:17,235
OK.

831
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:20,697
Entering.

832
00:53:20,865 --> 00:53:24,659
At the Grand Ball,
you enter with the Queen,

833
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:29,038
but at the State Dinner,
you enter unaccompanied.

834
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:30,707
Shoulders back...

835
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:35,253
...smile.
They're all happy to see you.

836
00:53:35,421 --> 00:53:38,047
- [Man 1] There she is.
- [Man 2] How is she?

837
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,675
You are much prettier.

838
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:49,601
Well done, the worst is over.

839
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:53,187
Our diligent Prime Minister,
Sebastian Motaz.

840
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:55,857
- Hello.
- His lovely wife, Sheila.

841
00:53:56,025 --> 00:53:57,108
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Hello.

842
00:53:57,276 --> 00:53:59,736
Their charming daughter, Marissa.

843
00:53:59,904 --> 00:54:02,196
Lord Fricker,
let me take your brandy glass.

844
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:04,365
You won't need it in there.

845
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:07,410
Easy on the schnapps,
remember the Winter Dinner.

846
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:10,538
I'm not allowed to go to the party.

847
00:54:12,625 --> 00:54:14,542
Dinner is served.

848
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:16,753
[Snoring]

849
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:22,258
Her Majesty, Queen Clarisse.

850
00:54:26,138 --> 00:54:30,767
Someday we will own Genovia again
and you will be Queen.

851
00:54:30,935 --> 00:54:34,562
And your face
will be on a postage stamp.

852
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:52,622
- How are the children, Robby?
- Would you like to see them, ma'am?

853
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:57,585
There's Ryan and there's Bridget.

854
00:54:57,753 --> 00:55:00,505
[Clarisse] Ohh. They're beautiful.

855
00:55:00,673 --> 00:55:03,132
Would you like to see?

856
00:55:05,177 --> 00:55:09,138
Mr. Prime Minister, how would you say
the pear market is doing in Genovia?

857
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:14,018
The Genovian pear market is blossoming,
if you'll pardon the pun.

858
00:55:14,186 --> 00:55:17,563
I hear they're serving
filet on the bone.

859
00:55:32,997 --> 00:55:35,832
And that's their princess.

860
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:40,294
- They grow up so fast, don't they?
- Hi.

861
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:43,297
- You wanted to see me?
- Is everything all right?

862
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:46,342
- Yes.
- What happened with the ice bucket?

863
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:48,386
Oh, um... [stammers]

864
00:55:48,554 --> 00:55:51,431
- I had a clumsy moment.
- OK.

865
00:55:52,224 --> 00:55:54,434
The food's delicious, by the way.

866
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:01,691
[Sheila] It was for a feminist group in
Scotland called Tarts for Tartan.

867
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:04,986
- They were a wild bunch.
- Very exciting.

868
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:07,196
Thank you.

869
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:13,202
Between the courses
to cleanse the palate.

870
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:14,829
- Mm.
- Yeah?

871
00:56:23,756 --> 00:56:25,089
[Whimpering]

872
00:56:25,257 --> 00:56:27,175
[Muffled] I'm fine. It's cold!

873
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:29,802
- She didn't realize it was frozen.
- What should we do?

874
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:31,888
We should take that much, too.
Just do the same thing.

875
00:56:32,056 --> 00:56:35,391
- [Muffled] No!
- [Both moaning]

876
00:56:41,065 --> 00:56:43,024
They are acting like monkeys.

877
00:56:55,996 --> 00:56:58,998
Have you ever experienced
that instant headache

878
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:00,750
when you eat ice too quickly?

879
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:03,753
No.

880
00:57:08,092 --> 00:57:10,051
Wash your hands.

881
00:57:13,764 --> 00:57:15,389
[Clears throat]

882
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:25,108
- I'm really sorry.
- It happens all the time.

883
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:29,237
I would like to propose a toast,

884
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:32,365
to the Baroness and Baron von Troken.

885
00:57:32,533 --> 00:57:35,576
May you always be Baron.

886
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:43,793
The famous Genovian
pear and cheese dessert.

887
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:45,795
What else?

888
00:57:53,137 --> 00:57:54,762
Ooh.

889
00:57:56,765 --> 00:57:59,392
[Woman] You are nothing
but an overdressed, drunken...

890
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,185
I'm outta here.

891
00:58:02,521 --> 00:58:04,313
- [Shouts]
- [Woman gasps]

892
00:58:08,527 --> 00:58:10,653
[Woman] I am sopping.

893
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:15,283
Was that my fault?

894
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:21,747
[Laughing]

895
00:58:29,381 --> 00:58:32,175
[All laughing]

896
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:40,516
Shall we adjourn
to the Grand Ball for coffee?

897
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:57,575
Sorry I let you down, Dad.

898
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:03,497
Good night, Louie.

899
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:06,083
[Music box chiming]

900
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:15,009
[Clarisse] This place was such a mess
when I first arrived.

901
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:17,887
I've been spending every
spare moment in it I can.

902
00:59:19,765 --> 00:59:22,725
Pick up one of these.
Make yourself useful. Spray everything.

903
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:26,312
- You're not mad for what happened?
- Actually, I found it rather funny.

904
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,899
Reminds me of my first
royal dinner party.

905
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:31,692
I knocked over a suit of armor

906
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:35,279
and the spear went right through
the suckling pig.

907
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:46,290
Amelia, why don't we cancel lessons
for today and just have some fun.

908
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:49,919
Fun? You're not too busy
for something like that?

909
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:52,421
Your Majesty,
Lady Jerome has just arrived,

910
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:55,007
and I have the French Consulate's
assistant on hold.

911
00:59:55,175 --> 00:59:56,801
He wants to confirm tonight's dinner.

912
00:59:56,969 --> 00:59:59,428
Send my apologies.
Cancel everything today.

913
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:03,057
I'm being shown San Francisco
by a true San Franciscan.

914
01:00:03,225 --> 01:00:04,809
Tell Joseph I'll need the car.

915
01:00:04,977 --> 01:00:07,728
- Yes, ma'am.
- Oh, wait, um...

916
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:10,815
...I want to show you my baby.

917
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:15,486
[♪ Lil' J featuring Nobody's Angel
and Tammie Phoenix:

918
01:00:15,654 --> 01:00:17,405
"Ain't Nuthin' But A She Thing"]

919
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:27,331
[Clarisse] I haven't sat in the front
seat of a car in the longest time.

920
01:00:27,499 --> 01:00:30,209
[Mia] By the way, thanks for
the money for my car, Grandma.

921
01:00:31,003 --> 01:00:32,545
[Clarisse] So where are you taking me?

922
01:00:32,713 --> 01:00:36,048
- [Mia] Well, do you have any change?
- No.

923
01:00:36,216 --> 01:00:38,968
It's not appropriate
for royalty to jingle.

924
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:40,845
[Mia] OK, I'll get the change.

925
01:00:43,015 --> 01:00:47,601
Oh! This one's my favorite.
You put a quarter in and grab his hand.

926
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:49,812
- I touch that?
- Yeah, you touch that.

927
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:53,983
And then you press the button
and, um...

928
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:56,027
...then you just go.
- All right.

929
01:00:56,945 --> 01:01:00,323
Looks like Rupert's cousin
from Liechtenstein.

930
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:02,950
- How do I know it's ready?
- It'll just go.

931
01:01:03,118 --> 01:01:04,702
There you go. It's going.
It's going!

932
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:06,495
- Go, go, go, go!
- Ow!

933
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:08,706
You enjoy this humiliation?

934
01:01:08,874 --> 01:01:11,042
[Mia] It's hard the first time,
but you can do it again.

935
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:12,918
- Hold this.
- Thank you.

936
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:14,462
[Mia] Come on, you can do it.

937
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:16,881
I'm ready for you this time.

938
01:01:17,049 --> 01:01:20,134
Go. It's going, it's going.
Go, go, go.

939
01:01:20,302 --> 01:01:22,595
Go, you're doing good.

940
01:01:22,763 --> 01:01:26,390
Yes! You got it. Gimme five.

941
01:01:26,558 --> 01:01:28,351
- Five? Oh.
- Five.

942
01:01:31,355 --> 01:01:32,688
- [Clarisse] Oh.
- [Mia laughs]

943
01:01:32,856 --> 01:01:36,692
Ohh... I want one of these.

944
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:38,736
Just not this one.

945
01:01:43,075 --> 01:01:46,494
So... Did my father always
want to be a prince?

946
01:01:47,788 --> 01:01:49,705
Oh, yes.

947
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:52,917
Except once about 15 years ago.

948
01:01:53,085 --> 01:01:56,295
He seriously considered
renouncing his title.

949
01:01:56,463 --> 01:01:59,882
Because he met a lovely artist
who showed him wonderful things

950
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:03,761
about how life could be,
how he could be.

951
01:02:04,763 --> 01:02:06,263
But?

952
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:12,395
But he had a decision to make.
Nobody could make it for him.

953
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:16,482
Not I, though many people thought I did,
or anybody else.

954
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:19,235
Philippe knew that my first born,

955
01:02:19,403 --> 01:02:21,529
his brother Pierre, wanted to abdicate

956
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:25,116
which he did, eventually,
to join the church.

957
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:29,328
Your father realized that the love
he could have for one person,

958
01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:30,996
or even two,

959
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:35,584
could not make him forget the love
he felt for his country and its people.

960
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:41,757
It was the hardest thing
he ever had to do.

961
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:45,970
Oh. Oh.

962
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:50,766
- Do you want a bite of this?
- Why not?

963
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:53,853
Well, here goes.

964
01:02:57,691 --> 01:03:00,693
- Why, it's delicious.
- Really?

965
01:03:00,861 --> 01:03:02,236
- Mm-hm.
- Oh, OK, well, then, um,

966
01:03:02,404 --> 01:03:04,280
let's get another one.

967
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:09,702
I know it's the fastest way back
to the consulate, but I hate this hill.

968
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:12,455
I do believe I'm beginning
to feel that corn dog.

969
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:14,498
- [Mia whimpering]
- [Brakes screech]

970
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:17,877
Maybe you could sneak gently through.

971
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:19,587
- OK, I'll try.
- Good.

972
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:22,631
- Now blaze on up.
- I got it.

973
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,216
- Yes, you've got it.
- I got it.

974
01:03:24,384 --> 01:03:25,885
You've got it.

975
01:03:27,012 --> 01:03:29,430
- [Mia] I haven't got it.
- [Clarisse] Uh-oh.

976
01:03:29,598 --> 01:03:31,807
- Mia... Mia, brake! Brake!
- [Mia screams]

977
01:03:31,975 --> 01:03:33,851
- Look out!
- Oh!

978
01:03:34,019 --> 01:03:35,269
Down here!

979
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:38,814
[All scream]

980
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:41,650
911, I need to report an accident.

981
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:44,778
Didn't you hear the bell?

982
01:03:46,448 --> 01:03:49,033
- They put me on hold.
- For the love of God.

983
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:52,119
[Man] Put down
destruction of public property.

984
01:03:52,287 --> 01:03:56,790
I will and last, but not least,
driving without a license.

985
01:03:56,958 --> 01:04:01,295
Accompanied by an adult
whose license expired 45 years ago.

986
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:06,217
I've been trying to tell you, officer.
Licenses don't expire in Genovia.

987
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:09,887
Not for the Queen.
Don't I have diplomatic immunity?

988
01:04:10,055 --> 01:04:12,264
You do, but her
we have to take downtown.

989
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:13,432
What?

990
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:17,728
- I'm sorry, miss.
- It's all right, I understand.

991
01:04:19,898 --> 01:04:24,109
- I understand perfectly.
- You do?

992
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:29,657
Mia, no town, no city, no country
can function peacefully

993
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:32,952
if it's officers
and transportation engineers

994
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:35,162
don't follow the letter of the law.

995
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:37,206
I would be proud to have

996
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:41,377
two such fine, honorable gentlemen
serving in Genovia.

997
01:04:41,545 --> 01:04:45,422
- Aw shucks, ma'am.
- We're not all that.

998
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:48,342
Oh, but you most certainly are.

999
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:50,094
As a matter of fact,

1000
01:04:50,262 --> 01:04:54,974
I would like to bestow upon you
the honor of the, um...

1001
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:57,601
...Genovian Order of the...

1002
01:04:57,769 --> 01:05:01,897
...uh, Genovian Order of the Rose.

1003
01:05:03,191 --> 01:05:06,235
- Oh. Oh! Ooh!
- [All] Ooh!

1004
01:05:08,363 --> 01:05:11,282
- Oh...
- Won't you please kneel?

1005
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:16,287
Does anybody have a saber?

1006
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:19,039
- Oh, I've got an umbrella.
- Uh...

1007
01:05:19,207 --> 01:05:22,376
- I have an emergency brake.

But what started out as innocent fun,

1205
01:18:05,431 --> 01:18:08,475

allegedly too much fun.

didn't I?

Not to put too fine a point on it,
yes, you did.

1212

I think you're making a wise decision
to abstain from the job.

I suppose I won't come
to the ball, then.

Of course you should come.
You're still family.

1215
01:18:42,385 --> 01:18:46,763
Just because you don't want to be our
princess, doesn't mean you're in exile.

Your mother's planning to come.

If I may say so,
that did not go very well.

Is this the way a princess should act?

1223
01:19:20,131 --> 01:19:22,757
My information tells me
that boy was using her.

1224
01:19:22,925 --> 01:19:27,637
The kiss was merely a device
so he'd get his 15 minutes of fame.

Her friends didn't help, either.

She's only 15.
But today she acted beyond her years.

She showed great respect
and gracefully accepted your criticism.

1230
01:19:46,824 --> 01:19:50,410
You're saying that as a queen,
I was too harsh on her.

1231
01:19:50,578 --> 01:19:55,832
I was critical of the person who could
become the next ruler of my country.

I'm saying as a grandmother,

you might have been too harsh
on your granddaughter.

1334
01:26:06,495 --> 01:26:08,120
Are you hungry or thirsty?

1335
01:26:08,288 --> 01:26:10,581
- No.
- Here it is.

1336
01:26:10,749 --> 01:26:13,000
Um, look...

1337
01:26:13,168 --> 01:26:17,088
Thank you for doing this for me.
It's really great of you.

1338
01:26:17,256 --> 01:26:19,924
I didn't do it for you.
Doc lets my band practice.

1339
01:26:20,092 --> 01:26:21,676
- Right.
- I help with the cars.

1340
01:26:21,844 --> 01:26:24,846
- Here.
- Thanks.

1341
01:26:27,683 --> 01:26:30,434
I know you're still mad at me
for blowing you off,

1342
01:26:30,602 --> 01:26:35,022
and I'm really sorry I did.

1343
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:37,692
I'm going to try to make it up to you.

1344
01:26:40,737 --> 01:26:42,655
- How?
- Well, um...

1345
01:26:42,823 --> 01:26:45,616
I'm still going to the
Genovian Independence Day Ball

1346
01:26:45,784 --> 01:26:48,703
and I'm inviting you.

1347
01:26:48,871 --> 01:26:51,998
It could be fun.

1348
01:26:52,165 --> 01:26:55,209
I'm wearing this great dress
I can't breathe in.

1349
01:26:55,377 --> 01:26:59,171
- Lilly's got a date.
- Josh looks better in a tux.

1350
01:27:00,716 --> 01:27:02,258
Oh, um...

1351
01:27:02,426 --> 01:27:04,260
But see, it's...

1352
01:27:05,762 --> 01:27:08,514
I really want you
to be the one I share it with.

1353
01:27:10,058 --> 01:27:11,475
You don't have to wear a tux.

1354
01:27:11,643 --> 01:27:15,229
You can wear sweatpants for all I care.

1355
01:27:18,358 --> 01:27:20,568
Don't worry about me.

1356
01:27:20,736 --> 01:27:23,195
I just consider myself royally flushed.

1357
01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:39,587
Ow.

1358
01:27:39,755 --> 01:27:42,590
Stop the bovine massacre.
Sign up now and save a cow.

1359
01:27:42,758 --> 01:27:46,761
Vegetarians have rights.
Make Grove School more tofu friendly.

1360
01:27:46,929 --> 01:27:47,929
- Hello.
- Hi.

1361
01:27:48,096 --> 01:27:51,015
Go sit by Jeremiah,
I'll be there in a minute.

1362
01:27:51,183 --> 01:27:54,101
She's wearing that dorky hat again.

1363
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:57,480
- You want to see a trick?
- Not right now.

1364
01:27:57,648 --> 01:28:00,775
What are you doing?
Are you writing a story or...

1365
01:28:00,943 --> 01:28:04,737
My portfolio's increased by 30 percent
since last quarter...

1366
01:28:04,905 --> 01:28:07,865
Look what we have,
the perfect nerd couple.

1367
01:28:08,033 --> 01:28:10,034
Jeremiah and Mia.

1368
01:28:10,202 --> 01:28:12,578
[Both] Oh, Miah and Mia.

1369
01:28:12,746 --> 01:28:15,122
Listen, my friends and I were wondering

1370
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:19,543
was the sweater designed for you, or
did the knitting machine just blow up?

1371
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:23,798
Sunglasses, girls.
It's Jeremiah hair glare.

1372
01:28:23,966 --> 01:28:26,509
Is one of your magic tricks your hair?

1373
01:28:28,178 --> 01:28:30,471
- Hey, Lana, you know...
- Huh?

1374
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:34,725
That is such a cute cheerleading outfit,
it's so clean cut.

1375
01:28:34,893 --> 01:28:38,312
- I just, I bet it goes with anything.
- Of course it does...

1376
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:41,607
- [screaming]
- [Gasps]

1377
01:28:44,403 --> 01:28:45,987
Mia, you're such a freak.

1378
01:28:46,154 --> 01:28:49,782
Yeah, I am, but someday
I might grow out of that.

1379
01:28:49,950 --> 01:28:52,702
But you?
You will never stop being a jerk.

1380
01:28:52,869 --> 01:28:55,371
- Lana got coned.
- [All chanting] Lana got coned.

1381
01:28:55,872 --> 01:28:58,582
- Lana got coned!
- Mia!

1382
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:01,335
- Toodles.
- [Chanting continues]

1383
01:29:01,503 --> 01:29:03,963
Mrs. Gupta, did you see
what she did to me?

1384
01:29:04,131 --> 01:29:09,218
Oh, no, honey, I'm sorry.
I was in a very important meeting.

1385
01:29:09,386 --> 01:29:11,512
Send it out for dry cleaning.

1386
01:29:27,029 --> 01:29:30,573
It's a present for your 16th birthday,
from your father.

1387
01:29:30,741 --> 01:29:33,367
It was found among his possessions.

1388
01:29:35,245 --> 01:29:37,705
- My birthday's not for two weeks.
- I know.

1389
01:29:37,873 --> 01:29:40,166
I wanted you to have it before we leave.

1390
01:29:40,333 --> 01:29:43,085
I return to Genovia
the day after tomorrow.

1391
01:29:44,254 --> 01:29:46,338
Thank you.

1392
01:29:47,549 --> 01:29:48,924
It's locked.

1393
01:29:49,092 --> 01:29:53,387
If you open the locket I gave you,
it becomes the key.

1394
01:29:54,681 --> 01:29:56,807
Thank you for bringing it down here.

1395
01:29:56,975 --> 01:29:59,643
I also came to apologize

1396
01:29:59,811 --> 01:30:02,688
for the way I spoke to you
about the beach incident.

1397
01:30:02,856 --> 01:30:07,276
It was judgmental of me.
I didn't pause to verify the facts.

1398
01:30:07,444 --> 01:30:08,736
That's all right, Grandma.

1399
01:30:10,072 --> 01:30:12,156
I've been thinking about it
a great deal.

1400
01:30:12,324 --> 01:30:16,452
The truth is, I think you'd make
a very fine princess.

1401
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:20,289
People think princesses
are supposed to wear tiaras,

1402
01:30:20,457 --> 01:30:24,710
marry the prince, always look pretty
and live happily ever after.

1403
01:30:24,878 --> 01:30:29,507
But it's so much more than that.
It's a real job.

1404
01:30:34,262 --> 01:30:38,766
You are an extraordinary person,
Grandma.

1405
01:30:38,934 --> 01:30:42,269
But I don't think
I'm meant to do this.

1406
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:48,317
I would be so afraid that I would
disappoint the people of Genovia,

1407
01:30:48,485 --> 01:30:53,405
and I couldn't bear
to disappoint you again.

1408
01:30:57,452 --> 01:31:01,413
Well, as I said, I have faith in you.

1409
01:31:06,294 --> 01:31:08,295
- I'm a writer.
- Ah.

1410
01:31:08,463 --> 01:31:11,257
- I write soaps, soap opera.
- Mm-hm.

1411
01:31:12,926 --> 01:31:16,512
- Ever see Middle House Road?
- No.

1412
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:20,349
Big hit. I wrote a character
just like you once, he was a spy.

1413
01:31:20,517 --> 01:31:24,770
- I'm not a spy.
- That's what the character said.

1414
01:31:26,314 --> 01:31:28,566
- [Mia] I'll see you tonight, then.
- [Clarisse] Mm-hm.

1415
01:31:30,235 --> 01:31:32,027
Haaaa...

1416
01:31:32,779 --> 01:31:36,407
Uh, I do have one favor to ask.

1417
01:31:36,575 --> 01:31:40,911
I need you to formally renounce
your title for the press.

1418
01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:43,831
At the ball, you know.

1419
01:31:44,791 --> 01:31:46,750
- Make a speech.
- Mm-hm.

1420
01:31:46,918 --> 01:31:48,169
Oh, um...

1421
01:31:48,336 --> 01:31:51,297
Do you think, maybe,
considering my history with the press,

1422
01:31:51,464 --> 01:31:54,133
- it would be better if you did it?
- Amelia,

1423
01:31:54,301 --> 01:31:56,510
you wouldn't stop driving your Mustang

1424
01:31:56,678 --> 01:32:00,264
just because a couple of insects
hit the windshield, would you?

1425
01:32:00,432 --> 01:32:03,642
Besides, look how far you've come.
I'll be right there with you.

1426
01:32:03,810 --> 01:32:07,688
- I'll have Joseph pick you up at...
- Uh, no.

1427
01:32:07,856 --> 01:32:10,191
I promised I'd let my mom drive me.

1428
01:32:10,358 --> 01:32:14,111
She wants to drive me to my first ball
or something.

1429
01:32:16,114 --> 01:32:20,159
- All right. I'll see you there, then.
- Mm-hm.

1430
01:32:21,411 --> 01:32:23,078
Grandma?

1431
01:32:27,667 --> 01:32:29,668
I am sorry.

1432
01:32:31,213 --> 01:32:33,172
Oh, my dear.

1433
01:32:33,340 --> 01:32:37,843
You are first and foremost,
my granddaughter.

1434
01:32:49,940 --> 01:32:51,649
Please don't be late.

1435
01:32:51,816 --> 01:32:53,692
[♪ B*Witched: "Hold On"]

1436
01:33:24,474 --> 01:33:28,060
Thank you, Dad,
but I can't be a princess. OK?

1437
01:33:28,228 --> 01:33:30,896
I don't make speeches
and I'm not Clarisse Renaldi.

1438
01:33:31,064 --> 01:33:35,276
And I just... I can't do it.

1439
01:33:35,443 --> 01:33:37,486
I'm scared.

1440
01:33:37,654 --> 01:33:39,613
- Joseph.
- Charlotte, Miss Kawa.

1441
01:33:41,283 --> 01:33:43,617
Pardon me, I have to go
get the band ready.

1442
01:33:43,785 --> 01:33:46,370
Should you be going
to get Princess Mia?

1443
01:33:46,538 --> 01:33:48,998
Mia told Clarisse her mother
would be bringing her.

1444
01:33:49,165 --> 01:33:53,043
Helen just arrived and said
Mia was waiting for you.

1445
01:33:53,211 --> 01:33:54,420
She's going to run.

1446
01:33:55,297 --> 01:33:58,215
[Mia] Come on, Fat Louie, time to pack.
Let's get your things.

1447
01:34:00,927 --> 01:34:01,969
Louie?

1448
01:34:02,137 --> 01:34:06,890
What have you got there?
Come on. We're going on a trip.

1449
01:34:07,058 --> 01:34:10,352
We're going to Colorado
where we can climb some real rocks.

1450
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:18,777
We are so out of here, Louie.

1451
01:34:22,991 --> 01:34:24,908
[Mia's voice] My dearest daughter,

1452
01:34:25,076 --> 01:34:28,495
today is your 16th birthday,
congratulations.

1453
01:34:28,663 --> 01:34:32,833
I present you with this diary to fill
the pages with your special thoughts.

1454
01:34:33,001 --> 01:34:36,045
Special thoughts of your wonderful life.

1455
01:34:36,212 --> 01:34:40,257
[Father's voice] It is a custom in my
family to pass on a piece of wisdom

1456
01:34:40,425 --> 01:34:42,343
when one reaches this age.

1457
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:45,888
I pass it on to you, as my father
passed it on to me.

1458
01:34:46,056 --> 01:34:50,559
Amelia, courage is not the absence of
fear, but rather the judgment

1459
01:34:50,727 --> 01:34:54,646
that something else
is more important than fear.

1460
01:34:54,814 --> 01:34:59,693
The brave may not live forever,
but the cautious do not live at all.

1461
01:34:59,861 --> 01:35:02,488
From now on,
you'll be traveling the road

1462
01:35:02,655 --> 01:35:07,034
between who you think you are
and who you can be.

1463
01:35:07,202 --> 01:35:11,413
The key is to allow yourself
to make the journey.

1464
01:35:11,581 --> 01:35:14,375
I also want you to know,

1465
01:35:14,542 --> 01:35:19,546
I loved your mother very much
and still think of her often.

1466
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:22,174
Happy birthday, my Mia.

1467
01:35:22,342 --> 01:35:25,386
All my love, your father.

1468
01:35:30,809 --> 01:35:34,812
[Man] There's Countess Puck of Austria
as the glamorous continue to arrive

1469
01:35:34,979 --> 01:35:36,897
at the Genovian Independence Ball.

1470
01:35:37,065 --> 01:35:41,402
Despite threats of rain, the turn out
includes the mayor of San Francisco

1471
01:35:41,569 --> 01:35:43,946
and the Genovian pear juggler.

1472
01:35:44,114 --> 01:35:47,574
The future of Genovia is in the hands
of young Mia Thermopolis.

1473
01:35:47,742 --> 01:35:50,619
Her decision tonight
will affect the queen, the court,

1474
01:35:50,787 --> 01:35:54,081
and all the people
of this small, but proud, country.

1475
01:35:55,333 --> 01:35:59,878
- Do you think it's going to rain on us?
- It never comes down on Willie Brown.

1476
01:36:00,046 --> 01:36:03,257
- Thank you.
- Umbrellas up.

1477
01:36:05,468 --> 01:36:07,719
And that's enough pear juggling.

1478
01:36:09,931 --> 01:36:12,057
[Mia] The trip is off, Louie.

1479
01:36:14,644 --> 01:36:16,603
[Thunder crashes]

1480
01:36:24,779 --> 01:36:27,739
Oh! Perfect.

1481
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:40,043
Oh, come on.

1482
01:36:41,629 --> 01:36:45,382
Genovians are famous for their
impeccable taste in art.

1483
01:36:45,550 --> 01:36:47,593
Also for their cheese.

1484
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:50,846
Maybe it's string cheese.

1485
01:36:51,014 --> 01:36:54,141
- [Engine sputters]
- Don't do this, baby.

1486
01:36:54,309 --> 01:36:55,934
[Groans]

1487
01:36:56,102 --> 01:36:58,562
- [Engine starts]
- Gotcha!

1488
01:37:01,274 --> 01:37:03,442
Sorry, Mr. Robutusen.

1489
01:37:05,862 --> 01:37:08,113
Here you go.
It's already paid for.

1490
01:37:08,281 --> 01:37:10,949
- I didn't order pizza.
- You must've.

1491
01:37:11,117 --> 01:37:13,160
Unless there's another
Michael Moscovitz here.

1492
01:37:13,328 --> 01:37:16,663
We get a call, we deliver,
that's our motto.

1493
01:37:18,291 --> 01:37:20,167
- You don't make the pizza?
- No, no.

1494
01:37:20,335 --> 01:37:22,336
I just deliver them.

1495
01:37:39,229 --> 01:37:41,271

Earlier this evening,

I had every intention of
giving up my claim to the throne.

1571

I use the word "I."

If I cared about the other seven billion
out there, instead of just me,

1584

that's probably
a much better use of my time.

See, if I were Princess of Genovia,

then my thoughts and those
of people smarter than me

would be much better heard
and just maybe,

1588

turned into actions.
