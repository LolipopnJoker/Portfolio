1
00:00:03,421 --> 00:00:07,926
I'm Jay Wolpert, and I was
one of the writers on the film.

2
00:00:08,051 --> 00:00:11,262
Good day. My name is Stuart Beattie.
I was the second writer.

3
00:00:14,098 --> 00:00:17,685
This is Ted Elliott,
and the next voice you hear will be...

4
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,437
This is Terry Rossio.

5
00:00:19,562 --> 00:00:22,023
We wrote the screenplay

6
00:00:22,148 --> 00:00:26,486
and cowrote the screen story
for the film.

7
00:00:26,611 --> 00:00:29,697
[Stuart] My stuff is mainly
in the first half of the film.

8
00:00:29,822 --> 00:00:34,369
The latter half of the film
is more Ted and Terry's work.

9
00:00:34,494 --> 00:00:36,412
This opening scene

10
00:00:36,538 --> 00:00:40,917
originally came from
the first writer's draft, Jay Wolpert.

11
00:00:41,042 --> 00:00:43,253
This was a great way
to open a film.

12
00:00:43,378 --> 00:00:45,296
Especially a pirate film.

13
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:48,716
You're probably
expecting a big sea battle,

14
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:54,138
but we open up in fog
and it's quiet and eerie.

15
00:00:54,264 --> 00:00:58,851
To me that gave a great eerie tone.

16
00:00:58,977 --> 00:01:03,773
[Jay] I did what was called a cake,
which is, an approach to the movie.

17
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:09,112
I wrote my draft, by the way,
in the Andaman Sea, on a tall ship.

18
00:01:09,237 --> 00:01:14,033
I did research as I was writing.
It was a great way to write this movie.

19
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:15,785
[Sturat] Ted and Terry came in,

20
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,663
Academy Award-nominated writers
of <i>Shrek.</i>

21
00:01:18,788 --> 00:01:23,960
They were ready to listen
to the idea of undead pirates.

22
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:28,423
Or the pirate skeletons,
which were so much a part of the ride.

23
00:01:28,548 --> 00:01:33,636
[Ted] I wanna give Terry credit for
one of the smartest decisions.

24
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:38,016
We wanted, obviously, to work
the elements of the ride into the movie.

25
00:01:38,141 --> 00:01:41,853
And one we were stuck on was the song.

26
00:01:41,978 --> 00:01:45,940
We wanted the song in, but we
could not find a way to justify

27
00:01:46,065 --> 00:01:48,693
a bunch of pirates singing that song.

28
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:51,863
[Terry] It would undercut some of

29
00:01:51,988 --> 00:01:55,074
the intensity and villainy
of the pirates.

30
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:57,785
It occurred to me
that one way to bring it in

31
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,331
would be through the young
Elizabeth character,

32
00:02:01,456 --> 00:02:06,711
almost as if it is a children's song
that she was taught back in England.

33
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,054
[Terry] I love this parasol. I don't
know why Gore put it in, but it works.

34
00:02:16,179 --> 00:02:20,016
Again, that weirdness
of what is going to happen.

35
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:25,396
Preparing the audience
for something perhaps a bit different.

36
00:02:27,315 --> 00:02:31,611
[Stuart] Norrington was, in my draft,
in league with the bad guys.

37
00:02:31,736 --> 00:02:35,239
He wanted power, he wanted
to rule the Caribbean.

38
00:02:35,365 --> 00:02:39,035
He was first gonna do that by
trying to marry the governor's daughter

39
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,329
and gaining power through marriage.

40
00:02:41,454 --> 00:02:44,624
When she turns him down
in the first act,

41
00:02:44,749 --> 00:02:47,418
he goes into league
with the bad pirate captain,

42
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:52,423
whose plan, in my draft, was to
take over control of the Caribbean,

43
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:57,929
much like Henry Morgan did
in the late 1600s.

44
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:04,686
[Jay] The biggest challenge in writing
a swashbuckling pirate picture

45
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:09,190
is the balance between character
and action and comedy.

46
00:03:09,315 --> 00:03:11,442
That is really the challenge.

47
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:15,446
<i>- Pirates.
- There's no proof of that!</i>

48
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:17,031
<i>It was probably an accident.</i>

49
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:19,117
[Terry] There's a moment coming up

50
00:03:19,242 --> 00:03:24,122
that is so key to
the whole romantic relationship

51
00:03:24,247 --> 00:03:27,291
between Will and Elizabeth.

52
00:03:27,417 --> 00:03:31,421
Since there are only two kids
that you see here,

53
00:03:31,546 --> 00:03:34,132
you immediately start to...

54
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:38,010
...associate them together as a pair,

55
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:42,390
as somehow appropriate.

56
00:03:42,515 --> 00:03:45,309
The moment that I think is very telling

57
00:03:45,435 --> 00:03:49,313
is when she reaches down
and moves his hair aside.

58
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:53,109
From that point on, you know
those two will end up together.

59
00:03:55,987 --> 00:03:58,781
[Stuart] First acts set up characters.

60
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:01,492
What people want,
why they can't get it.

61
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:06,205
We had to set up that Elizabeth
is the governor's daughter,

62
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,000
and she's secretly in love with Will.

63
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:12,628
But she can't marry Will,
because he's a blacksmith.

64
00:04:12,754 --> 00:04:14,881
Great love stories always have

65
00:04:15,006 --> 00:04:19,135
one central conflict
keeping the two apart.

66
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,973
As long as you focus on that one thing
in every scene that they're in,

67
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:26,976
then I think you're on the right track.

68
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:35,568
[Terry] The fun little moment here is
because she took this pirate medallion,

69
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:39,530
she actually starts the film
as a pirate, as a thief.

70
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:42,200
She goes to the end of the ship
to look at it.

71
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:46,913
That explains how she's the only one
who sees the Black Pearl out there.

72
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:51,083
But then, as she wakes up,
you immediately start to question it.

73
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:55,671
Was that a dream? A memory?
Was it partly real?

74
00:04:55,797 --> 00:04:57,715
[Ted] How much really happened?

75
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,093
How much of what we saw is
what she believes happened?

76
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:13,856
[Terry] So then we see that
certainly the medallion is real.

77
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:16,025
[Ted] For people who are interested,

78
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,403
Elizabeth is the protagonist
of this story.

79
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:22,490
It's Elizabeth's actions throughout

80
00:05:22,615 --> 00:05:26,994
that propel all the other
characters into action.

81
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:31,582
[Terry] And also just from an almost
technical screenwriting point of view,

82
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:35,211
she's the access character
into the story.

83
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:37,672
It's told from her point of view.

84
00:05:37,797 --> 00:05:41,843
So she has to be in a scene
for us to see what's going on.

85
00:05:41,968 --> 00:05:46,973
Or a character that she introduces us to
does, or one related to her story.

86
00:05:47,098 --> 00:05:51,561
Such characters also become our point
of view characters in the story.

87
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:55,731
<i>I have a gift for you.</i>

88
00:05:57,525 --> 00:06:02,405
[Ted] It was nice that Governor Swann
let his wig go gray gracefully.

89
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:06,242
[Terry] Back to character introductions.

90
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:11,289
The first thing we see Elizabeth do
is steal a medallion.

91
00:06:11,414 --> 00:06:14,041
I love the way that Swann comes in

92
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:18,421
and even on something that minor,
he's still concerned with propriety

93
00:06:18,546 --> 00:06:20,923
and what she should be doing.

94
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:24,385
[Ted] I love the warmth Jonathan
Pryce brought to the part.

95
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:29,640
We wanted the immediate impression to be
"Here is the uptight, stuffy governor"

96
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:33,311
in the same way we wanted
the impression of Norrington to be,

97
00:06:33,436 --> 00:06:35,980
"Here's the wig-wearing, tea-sipping,

98
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:38,649
pompous British aristocrat."

99
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:41,819
<i>I'm told it's the
latest fashion in London.</i>

100
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:44,989
<i>Well, women in London
must've learned not to breathe!</i>

101
00:06:47,158 --> 00:06:48,826
<i>My Lord, you have a visitor.</i>

102
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:57,877
- [Terry] This is the first big laugh.
- [Ted] Listen to the sound effect here.

103
00:06:58,002 --> 00:07:01,797
[Terry] But the first thing we see
Will Turner do as he comes in is...

104
00:07:01,923 --> 00:07:03,174
[Ted] Something stupid.

105
00:07:03,299 --> 00:07:07,511
[Terry] He's clearly not comfortable
in this strata of society.

106
00:07:07,637 --> 00:07:10,348
[Ted] I wanna say just one thing.

107
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:12,808
Orlando Bloom signed to the movie

108
00:07:12,934 --> 00:07:15,978
the day before
he showed up to shoot this.

109
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:19,148
He came right in
and just got the character.

110
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:25,029
He had about ten minutes
to work on the stuff with the sword.

111
00:07:25,154 --> 00:07:26,781
The flip and everything.

112
00:07:26,906 --> 00:07:28,616
There are a couple of outtakes

113
00:07:28,741 --> 00:07:34,288
of that sword becoming
dangerously unguided.

114
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:37,667
But how well he plays this scene
is amazing.

115
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:42,546
Everything you need to know about
the character comes across here.

116
00:07:42,672 --> 00:07:46,676
[Jay] I've said this before,
I never met a sword I didn't like.

117
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:50,429
I have loved...

118
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:53,432
...swashbuckling movies
since I was a child.

119
00:07:55,977 --> 00:07:59,313
[Terry] I love when Keira comes down
and sees Orlando.

120
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:05,069
Her hand goes to the corset where
you know that the medallion is.

121
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:09,198
That's just a little callback
to say yeah, it's still there.

122
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:12,868
[Stuart] You really get a sense,
especially when he says here

123
00:08:12,994 --> 00:08:16,956
that he won't call her by her first
name, he'll call her by her title...

124
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:19,792
That's a clear indication
that he knows his place

125
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:23,879
and the great divide
that exists between them.

126
00:08:25,673 --> 00:08:27,091
<i>We really must be going.</i>

127
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:28,134
<i>Come on.</i>

128
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:30,761
<i>Good day, Mr. Turner.</i>

129
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:33,347
<i>Come along!</i>

130
00:08:36,726 --> 00:08:37,935
<i>Good day...</i>

131
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:42,273
<i>...Elizabeth.</i>

132
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:57,204
[Ted] Something to keep in mind is how
Johnny is introduced as Jack Sparrow.

133
00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:02,084
It's a great character introduction
and there's a lot of reversals in it.

134
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:06,464
Of course, you believe he's on top
of a stately ship, but he's not.

135
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:13,262
[Stuart] One of the greatest entrances
I've ever seen for a character.

136
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,639
The audience gets
a huge kick out of it

137
00:09:15,765 --> 00:09:19,310
and they're right into him
right from the beginning.

138
00:09:19,435 --> 00:09:23,314
They know all they need to know
about Jack Sparrow.

139
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:27,026
That is very clever writing.
That's really well done.

140
00:09:29,487 --> 00:09:34,658
[Terry] Johnny gets four introductions.
He gets the joke of coming off the mast.

141
00:09:34,784 --> 00:09:38,120
- [Ted] That reversal.
- [Terry] He gets the hanging pirates.

142
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:43,000
I love the fact that there's
one noose that's empty.

143
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:52,218
[Ted] Now here's something of interest.

144
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:57,640
Everything Johnny's doing
in this scene, he's doing backwards.

145
00:09:57,765 --> 00:10:00,392
The mast actually didn't sink.

146
00:10:00,518 --> 00:10:04,605
They were raising the water level
and somebody was pushing the dock in.

147
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,942
It was a bit of the magic
of movie making.

148
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:09,860
I thought it was very peculiar.

149
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:12,738
[Terry] His third introduction
is this grand shot

150
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:16,158
of stepping aboard the dock.

151
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:19,662
<i>It's a shilling to tie up
your boat to the dock.</i>

152
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:23,374
<i>And I shall need to know your name.</i>

153
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:28,337
<i>What do you say to three shillings,</i>

154
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:29,630
<i>and we forget the name?</i>

155
00:10:33,092 --> 00:10:35,302
<i>Welcome to Port Royal, Mr. Smith.</i>

156
00:10:35,678 --> 00:10:38,556
[Terry] This is his
fourth introduction,

157
00:10:38,681 --> 00:10:41,725
his duping of the dock
master here.

158
00:10:41,851 --> 00:10:44,145
Giving him money and getting it back.

159
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:47,064
It all plays into Johnny's character.

160
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:50,359
He's a guy who,
no matter how bad things go,

161
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:55,030
feels that somehow the universe
will come around to his point of view

162
00:10:55,156 --> 00:10:57,908
if he can just hang on long enough.

163
00:10:58,033 --> 00:11:00,786
Confident enough
to throw dust in everyone's eyes,

164
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:06,375
create havoc and figure that he can then
turn it to his own advantage.

165
00:11:09,587 --> 00:11:12,965
[Ted] He's up to something sneaky.

166
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:18,554
The characterization, the personality
of Jack, was what we wrote.

167
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:22,433
The expression of that personality
is pure Johnny Depp.

168
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:26,103
It was... How did you put it?

169
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:29,607
"Exactly what we described,
but nothing like we anticipated."

170
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:36,113
[Jay] Johnny Depp. An actor even more
than he's a movie star.

171
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:40,576
He's really good. He's a great actor
and a very brave actor.

172
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:44,079
I wish we could
con him into doing this

173
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:47,625
all over again cause
he's so terrific.

174
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,461
<i>This dock is offlimits to civilians.</i>

175
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:52,296
<i>Terribly sorry, I didn't know.</i>

176
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:55,049
<i>If I see one,
I shall inform you immediately.</i>

177
00:11:57,635 --> 00:11:59,053
[Ted] This scene here,

178
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:03,682
the conversation
between Murtogg and Mullroy and Jack,

179
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:08,270
is exactly as we wrote it in our first
draft, pretty much word for word.

180
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:11,440
I think Johnny threw in
a couple of words.

181
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:17,029
One original line was "There's some sort
of fancy to-do." He added, "high-toned".

182
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:21,283
"How did you merit an invitation?"
He made it, "How did two fine,

183
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:24,995
upstanding gents like yourselves
not merit an invitation?"

184
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,668
He just kept adding more and more words,
making his part larger and larger.

185
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:34,171
[Terry] One of the things
about Johnny's performance...

186
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:37,341
[Ted] Wait. I want to point out
that there is

187
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:41,720
a cinematic predecessor
to Jack Sparrow,

188
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:46,141
as evidenced in this scene,
and it's Bugs Bunny.

189
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:48,018
Bizarrely enough.

190
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:52,314
Jack Sparrow is a classic
trickster type of character,

191
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:56,318
which is a character archetype
that I really love.

192
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,946
You don't see many of them
in Hollywood movies,

193
00:12:59,071 --> 00:13:01,240
but it always works.

194
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:04,702
Characters like Groucho Marx
or Bugs Bunny

195
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:08,455
are the predecessors to Jack Sparrow.

196
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,624
[Terry] The way that character works,

197
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:14,211
which a lot of the critics
certainly have missed,

198
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:20,092
is that that character needs to work
in a reality world where he can work.

199
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:25,556
So Murtogg and Mullroy here have to play
a certain level of absurdism

200
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:28,225
in order to justify Johnny's actions.

201
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:34,231
Here comes the Bugs Bunny moment.
"How did he get over there?"

202
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:37,693
[Ted] Right there is
one of my favorite shots.

203
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:40,612
Just that one shot of Johnny
with the hand on the wheel.

204
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:45,617
I just love that shot.
His expression and the attitude.

205
00:13:45,743 --> 00:13:50,456
And here he goes again.
Jack Sparrow is the type of guy,

206
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:54,918
if he didn't feel that the reward
for his arrest was large enough,

207
00:13:55,044 --> 00:13:58,714
he would saw Florida off the USA
and send it down to Cuba.

208
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:01,050
That is the kind of guy Jack Sparrow is.

209
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:06,930
[Terry] Johnny also keyed into another
Warner Brothers character, Pepe LePew,

210
00:14:07,056 --> 00:14:11,518
a guy who believed the world was
different than how it actually is.

211
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:14,438
I thought that was really interesting.

212
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:18,108
[Stuart] Here's the same scene
I had with Norrington and Elizabeth.

213
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:23,947
He's saying, "I want to get married
to you and live happily ever after."

214
00:14:24,073 --> 00:14:27,326
In my draft she went as far
as turning him down.

215
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:31,121
Which triggered him into his plan B,
working with the bad pirates.

216
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:35,501
This is when the curse plot
starts to kick in with Ted and Terry.

217
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:39,046
[Ted] I like this scene,

218
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:43,634
because it could have
been played wrong so many ways.

219
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:48,764
Now you start to find out there's a bit
more to Norrington than you'd expect.

220
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:51,433
[Terry] One of the big
discoveries for us,

221
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:55,562
was that Keira is a comic actress,
she's just amazing.

222
00:14:55,687 --> 00:15:00,401
Her physical humor, her comic timing
is as good as anything I've seen.

223
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:03,153
[Ted] This moment here was so important.

224
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:08,409
The way we imagined it was
she had to just vanish.

225
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:12,496
So quickly that you couldn't comprehend
that she was falling off a cliff

226
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:14,498
until you saw her fall off the cliff.

227
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:17,709
[Terry] Trivia buffs,
when Johnny down there says,

228
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:20,212
"And then they made me their chief",

229
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:24,174
he's telling yet another version
of how he got off the island.

230
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:28,846
[Ted] The Robinson Crusoe version,
where he befriends the cannibals.

231
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:31,557
[Terry] Exactly.

232
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:37,563
[Ted] The other thing,
in terms of production trivia...

233
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:39,356
Keira fell off the fort,

234
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:44,027
which was actually
just south of Los Angeles.

235
00:15:44,153 --> 00:15:46,029
This was in the Caribbean.

236
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:48,615
Johnny dives off the ship
in the Caribbean

237
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:53,912
and then rescues her
in a tank in Long Beach.

238
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:56,748
So basically there's what,

239
00:15:56,874 --> 00:16:01,128
4,000 miles between those three shots.

240
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:03,922
8,000 miles total, back and forth.

241
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:05,549
[Terry] I love it when

242
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:09,052
characters take quick action
that gets us into the next scene.

243
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:12,723
Like that dive, where he immediately
says, "OK, I'm going in."

244
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:16,351
There isn't a lot of lead time
or preparation.

245
00:16:16,477 --> 00:16:18,729
Just bam, we're on to the next thing.

246
00:16:18,854 --> 00:16:23,775
[Ted] One of the things that I really
thought was very funny was the fact that

247
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:26,028
because of the production schedule,

248
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:30,699
Keira had not actually been
in the water in any of these outfits

249
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:33,076
when she was shooting this scene.

250
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:35,329
So, when she was finally rehearsing,

251
00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:38,582
like in the water
and she's wearing the shift,

252
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:42,211
or when she was training to do
the tearing off the dress -

253
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:44,880
she said to me,
"When I first read the script,

254
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:48,884
I thought the tearing
the dress off thing was gratuitous."

255
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,594
[Terry] Which it was.

256
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:55,098
[Ted] But then she said, "But it weighs
so much, nobody could swim in it."

257
00:16:55,224 --> 00:16:58,227
I said "Right, at the beginning
it's not gratuitous."

258
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:02,606
"The strip on the plank,
that was gratuitous."

259
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:05,817
[Terry] We love that
this is a film about a corset.

260
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:08,070
If the corset had not been too tight...

261
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:11,949
It's fun to get away with
such an obvious symbol.

262
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:14,284
[Ted] Societal constraint, propriety.

263
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:17,120
[Terry] It's extremely blatant,
but it works.

264
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:19,831
[Ted] Trivia,
<i>The East Indian Trading Company</i>

265
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:22,668
did brand pirates with a "P."

266
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:26,046
But they did it on their foreheads,
not on their arms.

267
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:27,881
But the decision was made.

268
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:32,803
We could have had it on his forehead.
you rarely would have seen it,

269
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:35,847
but it would have lurked
in people's minds

270
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:39,476
that Jack Sparrow has this huge P
branded on his forehead.

271
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:43,814
So we went with the historically
inaccurate brand on the arm.

272
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:47,150
<i>Well, I don't see your ship...</i>

273
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:53,824
[Ted] In a lot of the dialogue,
we actually wove in

274
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:59,830
important elements of the plot
and characters.

275
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:04,001
One of them is the introduction
of Jack's compass.

276
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:07,212
It's introduced as a joke.
It doesn't work.

277
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:10,799
But of course, later on you find out,
"Wait a second."

278
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:14,177
"That compass leads to <i>Isla de Muerta."</i>

279
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:20,225
Then you understand, "Oh. Jack has
always known where <i>Isla de Muerta</i> is."

280
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:27,149
<i>Commodore, I really must protest.</i>

281
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:31,570
[Stuart] There's nothing like
seeing your words come alive.

282
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:35,907
That's what you do it for.
The screenplay is the blueprint.

283
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:39,578
So to see the actors say your lines,
to see the sets,

284
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:43,874
to see the story come alive,
and then to see an audience respond,

285
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:47,794
that's what it's all about
and that's what happened here.

286
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,546
<i>And my hat.</i>

287
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:51,506
<i>Commodore.</i>

288
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:57,429
<i>- It is Elizabeth, isn't it?
- It's Miss Swann.</i>

289
00:18:57,554 --> 00:19:00,766
[Stuart] One highlight
of Johnny's performance,

290
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:03,143
as drunk as he seems most of the time,

291
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:06,188
every now and then we see
he's really dangerous

292
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:08,899
and he's one step ahead
of everyone else.

293
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:13,195
That was always the idea
for Jack Sparrow.

294
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,614
I was in an animal phase
when I wrote this.

295
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:18,408
Elizabeth Swann cause she's graceful.

296
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:23,288
Sparrow because he needs to be free
and fly like a bird.

297
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:30,962
I stopped short of naming Will,
Will Bear or something.

298
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:36,426
After two characters named after
animals, it starts to get a bit obvious.

299
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:43,725
Jack Sparrow just has
a great ring to it.

300
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:47,646
Great pirate name.

301
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:51,775
Poor Royal Navy soldiers.
It doesn't pay to be one of them.

302
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,944
You just get beat up

303
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:58,073
and hit upon
and killed by undead pirates.

304
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,326
<i>Now, will you shoot him?</i>

305
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:03,078
<i>Open fire!</i>

306
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:09,584
[Stuart] It was clever to cast
Johnny in a big action movie

307
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,045
because he doesn't do
big action movies.

308
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:17,968
He brings that air of originality to it
that is just so fantastic.

309
00:20:21,805 --> 00:20:24,307
You couldn't ask for better than this.

310
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:30,897
<i>Pirates</i> works because it's
all our childhood dreams

311
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:34,484
to grow up and be pirates
and sail the seas and be free.

312
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:38,530
That's really what Jack Sparrow
represents. And it's just fun.

313
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:42,826
Audiences are dying for something
fun and original.

314
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:44,494
<i>Look lively, men!</i>

315
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:06,099
[Terry] Here's the first meeting
between Jack and Will.

316
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:09,102
It's one thing to do a sword fight

317
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:11,772
and make it interesting,
inventive, exciting.

318
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:15,400
But the accomplishment
is to actually do a sword fight

319
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:17,527
and have character interaction.

320
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:21,948
I particularly like
how different lines are interwoven.

321
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:26,787
The sword fight is not only
conflict between the two characters.

322
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:31,792
Each character illustrates
their position, their beliefs.

323
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:36,963
It's more than just simply
trading insults during the sequence.

324
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:42,928
[Stuart] There are two ways
to write a good sword fight.

325
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:46,807
One is to say, "Will and Jack
face off and the battle ensues"

326
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:49,059
and leave it to the choreographers.

327
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:53,438
The other way is to go through it
and write it in a way that is exciting.

328
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:55,398
You don't use passive verbs.

329
00:21:55,524 --> 00:21:58,527
There's no, "He is standing."
It's, "He stands."

330
00:21:58,652 --> 00:22:02,864
That creates the more immediate action,
the immediate tension.

331
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:05,742
And you write it crisply and sharp

332
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:11,581
and you figure out what the room is and
you figure out what the elements are.

333
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:14,626
You create that emotion on the page

334
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:17,254
that you want the audience
to be feeling.

335
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:19,756
If you want it to be
a funny sword fight,

336
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:22,342
like in <i>The Princess Bride...</i>

337
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:25,345
That was all written out
by William Goldman

338
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,848
because it was informing character.

339
00:22:27,973 --> 00:22:32,143
The best action beats inform character.
And you'll see it in this.

340
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:34,771
When you have action
separate from character,

341
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:37,315
it'll end up being boring.

342
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,985
The best action scenes
speak to character.

343
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:45,949
This makes you laugh at and with Johnny
and gets you, again, more on his side.

344
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:51,162
[Ted] The key to action scenes,
this is how Terry and I do them,

345
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:55,709
is they've gotta be story scenes.
They've gotta carry plot and character

346
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:59,963
and the action itself has to demonstrate
plot and character.

347
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:05,051
We provided the outline
for the fight choreographer

348
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:07,178
and specific actions to say,

349
00:23:07,304 --> 00:23:11,391
here's Will's strategy
and here's Jack's

350
00:23:11,516 --> 00:23:13,894
and here's the goals they both have.

351
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:17,063
Jack just wants
to not fight with this guy

352
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:19,024
and get the hell out of there

353
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:23,236
and Will wants to basically
kill himself a pirate.

354
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:27,699
Particularly a pirate
who threatened Elizabeth.

355
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:32,245
[Terry] Will will always...
it's very subtle,

356
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:35,248
but he'll always let Jack
have time to recover.

357
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:38,960
He'll always engage him
in a classic, fair way.

358
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:43,757
Whereas Jack, as it will be revealed,
is perfectly willing to cheat.

359
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:55,518
[Terry] People might think Will throwing
the sword and pinning Jack in the room

360
00:23:55,644 --> 00:23:57,687
is a setup for later.

361
00:23:57,812 --> 00:24:03,109
But that was written before there was
going to be a need for it at the end.

362
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:05,737
We looked back at it
and then used it.

363
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:10,033
[Ted] Really it was a case of,
"Will has this ability. Let's use that."

364
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:13,286
Not "Let's set up Will's ability
for later, here."

365
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:17,123
[Terry] It was a discovery made
in the course of writing the story.

366
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:22,712
[Ted] We did not write a donkey.
This was something that was added in.

367
00:24:22,837 --> 00:24:25,590
I'm not sure exactly who it came from,

368
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:29,386
but it created
this movement in the scene

369
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:32,639
in opposition to the movement
of the two men fighting.

370
00:24:32,764 --> 00:24:37,268
It's really a great addition.
It really works well.

371
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:39,562
<i>I do.</i>

372
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:41,898
<i>And I practice with them.</i>

373
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,987
[Terry] One of the discoveries we made
in writing this scene,

374
00:24:47,112 --> 00:24:52,367
which we made fairly late, was,
"The Will character makes swords."

375
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:56,454
"We have a roomful of swords.
We can grab swords from anywhere."

376
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:59,082
"We can lose them,
we can pick them back up."

377
00:25:02,836 --> 00:25:05,296
<i>You're not a eunuch, are you?</i>

378
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:08,299
<i>I practice three hours a day
so that when I meet a pirate,</i>

379
00:25:08,425 --> 00:25:09,759
<i>I can kill him!</i>

380
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:15,724
[Stuart] Good films have at least
one central relationship.

381
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:18,101
You hear the term buddy movie,

382
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:20,270
but it all comes from

383
00:25:20,395 --> 00:25:24,399
the relationship between
two people and their tensions.

384
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:27,986
The characters are what you remember.
Plots come and go.

385
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:33,033
And that's one of the great things about
this story, this film, these characters.

386
00:25:33,158 --> 00:25:36,453
You remember them and they're funny
and you like them

387
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:41,291
and they grow and they learn, which
makes the film that much more enjoyable.

388
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:43,293
If you didn't care about them

389
00:25:43,418 --> 00:25:47,756
you'd be watching a ten-minute
fight scene and you wouldn't care.

390
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:52,635
You'd eating your popcorn,
checking messages on your phone.

391
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:58,558
But because you're invested in them,
and because of how it's choreographed,

392
00:25:58,683 --> 00:26:01,978
where it's very, very specific
to their characters,

393
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:04,981
you're totally involved in it.

394
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:18,203
[Ted] More trivia.
The soot used here is chocolate powder.

395
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:20,955
So you've got some
chocolate covered Bloom there.

396
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:23,124
Just thought I'd mention that.

397
00:26:25,835 --> 00:26:29,756
Jack had to be a very
morally ambiguous character.

398
00:26:29,881 --> 00:26:32,217
The audience should never
be sure about him.

399
00:26:32,342 --> 00:26:36,596
Is he a good guy? Is he a bad guy?
What is he exactly up to?

400
00:26:36,721 --> 00:26:39,766
When we wrote this scene
and he had the gun on Will,

401
00:26:39,891 --> 00:26:45,021
he actually raised the gun before
he said "This shot's not meant for you."

402
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:50,693
Johnny played it so that he held the gun
on Will the entire time.

403
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:54,447
And the line is almost a plea,

404
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:56,783
saying "Don't make me shoot you."

405
00:26:56,908 --> 00:26:59,744
It increased that
moral ambiguity of the character

406
00:26:59,869 --> 00:27:02,038
in a really terrific way.

407
00:27:02,163 --> 00:27:05,083
<i>You've assisted in the capture
of a dangerous fugitive.</i>

408
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:07,460
<i>Just doing my civic duty, sir.</i>

409
00:27:08,336 --> 00:27:11,047
<i>I trust you will always remember
that this is the day</i>

410
00:27:11,172 --> 00:27:14,551
<i>Captain Jack Sparrow almost escaped.</i>

411
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:16,344
<i>Take him away.</i>

412
00:27:20,056 --> 00:27:23,268
[Stuart] This is a funny scene,
an homage to the ride,

413
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:28,273
It reminds you that this is inspired by
the ride in its most general sense.

414
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:32,068
The ride doesn't have its own story,
just vignettes.

415
00:27:32,193 --> 00:27:37,782
So we weren't looking to make a movie
out of the story of the ride.

416
00:27:37,907 --> 00:27:41,619
We were looking to make a story
that stood on its own,

417
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:45,999
that had little vignettes
from the ride that you could wink at

418
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:49,252
and give the audience a laugh.

419
00:27:49,377 --> 00:27:51,921
[Terry] This scene with the maid here

420
00:27:52,046 --> 00:27:55,758
was suggested by Jerry Bruckheimer

421
00:27:55,884 --> 00:27:59,929
to get more understanding
of Elizabeth's character.

422
00:28:00,054 --> 00:28:01,723
And it works very well.

423
00:28:01,848 --> 00:28:03,766
<i>But... the Commodore proposed!</i>

424
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:05,435
<i>Fancy that!</i>

425
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:09,314
<i>Now that's a smart match, miss,
if it's not too bold to say.</i>

426
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:10,773
<i>It is a smart match.</i>

427
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:13,735
<i>He's a fine man.</i>

428
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:17,530
<i>He's what any woman
should dream of marrying.</i>

429
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:20,742
<i>Well, that Will Turner,</i>

430
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:23,286
[Jay] I love writing strong women

431
00:28:23,411 --> 00:28:27,957
because they don't have the weapons
to be strong that men do.

432
00:28:28,082 --> 00:28:29,709
You do a John Wayne scene

433
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:32,962
where he beats the heck out
of Ward Bond in some bar

434
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:35,506
and we know "Oh, boy,
don't mess with him."

435
00:28:35,632 --> 00:28:38,343
But women don't have that easy way out.

436
00:28:38,468 --> 00:28:42,847
So their strength has to come
in more subtle and more complex ways

437
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:45,391
and it's always a challenge.

438
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:09,832
[Terry] <i>Black Pearl</i> came out of
a character, oddly enough.

439
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:13,169
We needed a name for the ship
that would be appropriate

440
00:29:13,294 --> 00:29:16,589
for Barbossa to be in,

441
00:29:16,714 --> 00:29:20,718
also something appropriate for someone
you end up liking, Jack,

442
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:25,348
and so Black Pearl
kind of gives you both.

443
00:29:25,473 --> 00:29:30,770
[Stuart] The attack on Port Royal was
always central to get the story going.

444
00:29:30,895 --> 00:29:33,147
Just to explain how
it morphed into this...

445
00:29:33,273 --> 00:29:38,987
In Jay's draft it was Elizabeth
on a boat returning to London

446
00:29:39,112 --> 00:29:42,031
to go marry a gentleman
of proper stature

447
00:29:42,156 --> 00:29:46,077
and the bad pirate captain
hijacking the boat and kidnapping her.

448
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:49,706
In my draft, it became
more of a stealthy attack,

449
00:29:49,831 --> 00:29:52,709
with the pirates kidnapping Elizabeth.

450
00:29:52,834 --> 00:29:57,213
It was pirates sneaking in, killing the
guy at the door and kidnapping her.

451
00:29:57,338 --> 00:29:59,966
Will being the only one
who knows what's going on,

452
00:30:00,091 --> 00:30:03,261
chasing them,
trying to rescue her and failing.

453
00:30:03,386 --> 00:30:07,181
And the pirates taking Elizabeth
to their pirate captain.

454
00:30:07,307 --> 00:30:09,726
In this draft,
it's the full scale assault,

455
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:13,271
where they're really pillaging the town.

456
00:30:13,396 --> 00:30:17,859
It's a good example of how things change
from draft to draft.

457
00:30:19,736 --> 00:30:22,905
[Ted] This was amazing,
being on location for this.

458
00:30:23,031 --> 00:30:27,410
This was so complicated.
All of this was shot at once.

459
00:30:27,535 --> 00:30:32,206
This was all a single take.
Well, this was Universal Studios.

460
00:30:32,332 --> 00:30:36,419
The stuff on the beach and on the docks
was shot in the Caribbean.

461
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:41,758
This approach to the boat,
the gunfire, the pirates coming off,

462
00:30:41,883 --> 00:30:44,761
this was by shot multiple cameras
in a single take.

463
00:30:44,886 --> 00:30:48,431
And what was extraordinary
was that they got it in one.

464
00:30:48,556 --> 00:30:52,769
They did two takes, they always
do one in case something goes wrong,

465
00:30:52,894 --> 00:30:55,104
but the first take on this...

466
00:30:55,229 --> 00:30:59,317
I have to say, the stunt coordinator
and the stunt guys were extraordinary.

467
00:30:59,442 --> 00:31:01,444
They did an amazing job.

468
00:31:10,036 --> 00:31:13,122
[Stuart] There were
pirate conventions we had to follow.

469
00:31:13,247 --> 00:31:16,417
In reality, pirates were murderers,
rapists and cutthroats

470
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:18,961
not the kind of people
you want to hang on to.

471
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:23,758
But they've been romanced
over hundreds of years

472
00:31:23,883 --> 00:31:27,345
into this great swashbuckling
Errol Flynn image.

473
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:32,266
Pirates never walked the plank, pirates
never buried treasure. They spent it.

474
00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:37,480
When you talk about pirate conventions,
they're really untruths.

475
00:31:37,605 --> 00:31:41,734
But you still have to acknowledge them,
because that's what we know.

476
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:44,153
And you're not making a documentary.

477
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:49,075
So that's why you want walking
the plank and the buried treasure.

478
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,622
And then you wanna play with
argh and avast and matey and be's.

479
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:56,416
"I be this and I be that."

480
00:31:56,541 --> 00:32:01,462
That helps describe the world
that we know of as the pirate world.

481
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:07,468
So right from the start,
all my dialogue was much like that.

482
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:09,512
And we had all those ideas,

483
00:32:09,637 --> 00:32:14,267
the buried treasures,
the planks and so on.

484
00:32:20,523 --> 00:32:26,320
[Terry] There's a key moment coming up
here that probably wouldn't be noticed,

485
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:32,201
in fact, shouldn't be noticed.
But the maid here very overtly states

486
00:32:32,326 --> 00:32:35,913
that they're here to kidnap you,
you're the governor's daughter.

487
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:40,918
And that's laying in information
for a very difficult scene to write,

488
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:43,629
which was all the way forward
on Barbossa's ship.

489
00:32:43,754 --> 00:32:48,384
The notion was to put it in Elizabeth's
head, and in the audience's head,

490
00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:52,513
- so that she doesn't give her name.
- [Ted] This is the moment right there.

491
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:57,185
This shot of Keira looking at Mackenzie

492
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:59,061
is where I fell in love with Keira.

493
00:32:59,187 --> 00:33:02,231
Where I knew this was the right actress
in the right role.

494
00:33:02,356 --> 00:33:05,651
[Terry] Again, she's this
amazing physical actress.

495
00:33:05,776 --> 00:33:10,406
[Ted] She commits to the character
completely, and plays it fully.

496
00:33:10,531 --> 00:33:15,578
There's so much that she does with the
eyes and the expression, it's wonderful.

497
00:33:15,703 --> 00:33:18,581
[Terry] It reminds me
of some of Lucille Ball.

498
00:33:18,706 --> 00:33:22,585
- [Ted] Carole Lombard.
- [Terry] The great physical actresses.

499
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:25,171
[Ted] The moment with the maid...

500
00:33:25,296 --> 00:33:28,299
That moment causes
the audience to accept

501
00:33:28,424 --> 00:33:32,595
when she gives the wrong name
to Barbossa.

502
00:33:35,306 --> 00:33:38,768
[Jay] There are basically three
categories, in my view,

503
00:33:38,893 --> 00:33:40,436
of a swashbuckling movie.

504
00:33:40,561 --> 00:33:44,273
There is the one I call
"dark at the bottom of the dungeon,"

505
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:48,945
which is a serious swashbuckling movie.

506
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:51,822
For example,
<i>The Count Of Monte Cristo,</i>

507
00:33:51,948 --> 00:33:55,076
in which there's a dark crime,
or a dark menace.

508
00:33:55,201 --> 00:33:57,620
Then there's the stylish adventure.

509
00:33:57,745 --> 00:34:00,164
This has more "fun" fun in it.

510
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:03,000
You may not be quite as involved
with the characters

511
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:06,921
and you may not be living or dying
with them, but you are involved.

512
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:09,173
A good example is <i>The Mask Of Zorro.</i>

513
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:12,385
<i>Scaramouche</i> is the quintessential
example of that.

514
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:17,265
The 1948 <i>The Three Musketeers</i>
is a very good example of that.

515
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:19,225
There's a third category.

516
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:22,812
<i>Pirates Of The Caribbean</i>
belongs to almost its own category.

517
00:34:22,937 --> 00:34:26,649
It's what I would call
the rollicking high adventure.

518
00:34:26,774 --> 00:34:31,654
You still care about the characters.
You don't care desperately about them.

519
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:34,532
Whether they live or die
you kind of care about,

520
00:34:34,657 --> 00:34:37,326
but practically anything else
can happen.

521
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:40,663
Because you are so involved
with the good time you're having

522
00:34:40,788 --> 00:34:43,374
with the special effects

523
00:34:43,499 --> 00:34:48,170
and the running and jumping,
that it's OK.

524
00:34:48,296 --> 00:34:52,508
So you begin with a tremendous
involvement in character

525
00:34:52,633 --> 00:34:55,678
when you are dealing with the dark kind.

526
00:34:55,803 --> 00:34:58,598
Then as you move to the other categories

527
00:34:58,723 --> 00:35:03,686
there's more emphasis on action
and comedy and less on character.

528
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:05,271
<i>Say goodbye!</i>

529
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:14,655
[Terry] So far there really hasn't been
a lot of supernatural stuff going on.

530
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,867
It was fun to actually do
the slow reveal,

531
00:35:17,992 --> 00:35:23,789
but the idea was, this is the guy
that had an axe thrown into his back.

532
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:26,417
You'd think he'd be dead,
and here he is again.

533
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:30,796
Will looks at him like,
"How could you still be alive?"

534
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:33,466
But that is supposed to play as a hint

535
00:35:33,591 --> 00:35:37,887
that these pirates are supernatural
and more or less unkillable.

536
00:35:40,473 --> 00:35:43,684
<i>My sympathies, friend.
You've no manner of luck at all.</i>

537
00:35:47,438 --> 00:35:52,401
[Ted] I just wanna point out,
Jack is the worst escaper of all time.

538
00:35:52,526 --> 00:35:54,028
He does not escape...

539
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:57,823
There's a hidden Mickey.
There you go, Disney fans.

540
00:35:57,948 --> 00:36:01,619
He does not escape
from anything on his own.

541
00:36:01,744 --> 00:36:04,538
But again, as Johnny put it,

542
00:36:04,664 --> 00:36:08,084
that run-between-the-raindrops
attitude of Jack.

543
00:36:08,209 --> 00:36:10,628
He's always trying to get out,

544
00:36:10,753 --> 00:36:13,714
and turns the world
to his advantage so he gets out,

545
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:19,470
but he actually is incapable of escaping
from anything on his own.

546
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:23,933
[Terry] Again, Johnny's performance
is amazing,

547
00:36:24,058 --> 00:36:26,727
but it is framed by
all the other characters.

548
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:32,233
It's sustained by the situations
that he gets put in.

549
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:36,612
Everything goes into a performance
like that, cinematography, editing,

550
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:39,407
but particularly the other characters,

551
00:36:39,532 --> 00:36:44,453
who have to create
the environment for him.

552
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:52,920
[Ted] Here's another moment
to pay attention to the information.

553
00:36:53,045 --> 00:36:55,715
You get that these guys know each other,

554
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:59,427
but it's actually
establishing a timeline,

555
00:36:59,552 --> 00:37:03,848
that Jack was on the <i>Black Pearl</i>

556
00:37:03,973 --> 00:37:08,144
prior to them going to <i>Isla de Muerta</i>
and becoming cursed.

557
00:37:08,269 --> 00:37:12,481
That he knew about the curse,
but didn't actually believe it.

558
00:37:12,606 --> 00:37:14,650
So that's important information,

559
00:37:14,775 --> 00:37:17,862
but it is hidden, or woven in with,

560
00:37:17,987 --> 00:37:21,782
the forward movement of the story.

561
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:24,994
That's where Jack realizes
that if they're cursed,

562
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,123
all the stories he's
heard about them wanting gold

563
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:33,043
and needing Bootstrap Bill's blood
to get the curse undone are also true.

564
00:37:33,169 --> 00:37:36,297
He's seeing a way for him
to get the Black Pearl back.

565
00:37:36,422 --> 00:37:41,343
[Terry] I like that well into this
movie, it's the first truly overt...

566
00:37:41,469 --> 00:37:43,387
[Ted] Supernatural moment.

567
00:37:43,512 --> 00:37:46,223
[Terry] A cue to the audience
that says yes,

568
00:37:46,348 --> 00:37:50,352
there are ghosts in this movie,
there are walking skeletons.

569
00:38:02,531 --> 00:38:06,452
[Ted] This introduction of Barbossa
actually matches the one of Jack.

570
00:38:06,577 --> 00:38:09,038
Jack is in the light,
Barbossa's in the dark,

571
00:38:09,163 --> 00:38:12,708
but they're both standing
above everything else.

572
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:17,129
One of those odd things...

573
00:38:17,254 --> 00:38:20,382
that came out of conversations
between Terry and Gore and I

574
00:38:20,508 --> 00:38:23,219
is Terry and I are big fans
of Sergio Leone westerns.

575
00:38:23,344 --> 00:38:28,516
They take western conventions
and add this air of mythology.

576
00:38:28,641 --> 00:38:31,685
Some of the characters

577
00:38:31,811 --> 00:38:35,523
in the Leone westerns
are basically gods.

578
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:37,608
They are more than just mere mortals.

579
00:38:37,733 --> 00:38:40,903
They get involved in mortals' lives,

580
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:44,031
but mostly the issues of the gods
belong to the gods.

581
00:38:44,156 --> 00:38:48,410
That idea is actually played out
with Jack and Barbossa.

582
00:38:48,536 --> 00:38:52,414
They are the light and dark
of the same trickster archetype.

583
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:55,459
Again, here is basically Barbossa...

584
00:38:55,584 --> 00:38:58,712
The thing with the vocabulary
and not understanding,

585
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:01,715
you could see that
being something Jack would do.

586
00:39:01,841 --> 00:39:04,301
The deal he makes,
the loopholes he finds...

587
00:39:04,426 --> 00:39:06,512
They are paired in that way.

588
00:39:06,637 --> 00:39:09,431
One is the light side of this trickster

589
00:39:09,557 --> 00:39:12,935
and the other
is the dark side of the trickster.

590
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,398
<i>I saw it eight years ago
on the crossing from England!</i>

591
00:39:17,523 --> 00:39:18,607
<i>Did you now?</i>

592
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:22,945
[Stuart] There's a thousand things
you can do to make a story better.

593
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:27,783
You can't use them all at once,
but you find what works for the story.

594
00:39:27,908 --> 00:39:31,579
But one that is a constant
in action movies, at least,

595
00:39:31,704 --> 00:39:36,625
is ensuring your villain is the biggest,
baddest villain you can come up with.

596
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:42,381
That makes it harder for your hero.
It's all about obstacles.

597
00:39:42,506 --> 00:39:46,802
If it was easy you'd have no drama,
no conflict, and it'd be boring.

598
00:39:46,927 --> 00:39:51,181
You have to pitch your heroes
against impossible odds.

599
00:39:51,307 --> 00:39:52,975
Then you've got something good.

600
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:56,437
Once they overcome them,
you involve the audience.

601
00:39:56,562 --> 00:40:00,190
If you can get them to ask
how they are ever going to succeed

602
00:40:00,316 --> 00:40:02,067
and then they do succeed,

603
00:40:02,192 --> 00:40:06,322
you're hooking your audience in
and that's great storytelling.

604
00:40:06,447 --> 00:40:10,826
David and Goliath.
The same ideas go back to the Bible.

605
00:40:10,951 --> 00:40:14,413
Storytelling from thousands
of years ago.

606
00:40:14,538 --> 00:40:18,500
The bigger the enemy,
the more triumphant the win,

607
00:40:18,626 --> 00:40:22,129
the more you're involving your audience.

608
00:40:28,677 --> 00:40:30,846
<i>Our bargain?</i>

609
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:39,730
[Terry] This scene was actually set up
with that little maid scene.

610
00:40:39,855 --> 00:40:43,692
It's a very tough scene
and it only works

611
00:40:43,817 --> 00:40:48,030
in conjunction with the following scene
in the jail cell,

612
00:40:48,155 --> 00:40:52,868
where the audience is cued
that the name Turner is important.

613
00:40:52,993 --> 00:40:54,536
She only picks the name Turner

614
00:40:54,662 --> 00:40:59,833
to avoid revealing that she's actually
the daughter of the governor.

615
00:40:59,959 --> 00:41:03,212
[Ted] One of the things
that just came down to...

616
00:41:03,337 --> 00:41:07,383
Having seen young girls
and teenage girls that I know

617
00:41:07,508 --> 00:41:11,971
when they liked a guy,
trying out the name.

618
00:41:12,096 --> 00:41:16,600
You could see if Elizabeth
had a peachy or a keeper catcher,

619
00:41:16,725 --> 00:41:21,814
she would have written on it
"Mrs. Elizabeth Turner."

620
00:41:23,065 --> 00:41:25,150
<i>Mr. Murtogg, remove this man.</i>

621
00:41:26,235 --> 00:41:28,487
<i>We have to hunt them down!
We must save her!</i>

622
00:41:28,612 --> 00:41:32,282
[Terry] This is a favorite moment
because it's such a linchpin scene,

623
00:41:32,408 --> 00:41:37,246
but it's so well hidden in conflict
between Will and Norrington.

624
00:41:37,371 --> 00:41:43,127
We've got Murtogg and Mullroy
and they mention Jack Sparrow.

625
00:41:43,252 --> 00:41:45,838
The whole movie
would not have happened

626
00:41:45,963 --> 00:41:49,299
if it wasn't for these background,
comic characters

627
00:41:49,425 --> 00:41:51,969
piping up about Jack.

628
00:41:52,094 --> 00:41:54,304
But why did they bring up Jack?

629
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:56,765
Because Jack did mention
the <i>Black Pearl.</i>

630
00:41:56,890 --> 00:42:00,269
- Why did Jack mention it?
- [Ted] He wants his ship back.

631
00:42:00,394 --> 00:42:05,149
[Terry] It's Jack Sparrow throwing out
whatever he can throw out,

632
00:42:05,274 --> 00:42:07,317
this information about the Pearl.

633
00:42:07,443 --> 00:42:11,947
Had he not done that,
Will wouldn't have heard it here

634
00:42:12,072 --> 00:42:14,575
and the whole movie
wouldn't have happened.

635
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,786
<i>Do not make the mistake of thinking
you are the only man here</i>

636
00:42:17,911 --> 00:42:19,204
<i>who cares for Elizabeth.</i>

637
00:42:20,122 --> 00:42:22,791
[Stuart] Three things
to becoming a pirate.

638
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:25,044
One, steal a ship.
Two, make a black flag.

639
00:42:25,169 --> 00:42:27,421
Three, declare war against the world.

640
00:42:27,546 --> 00:42:30,841
That was the idea with Will,
to take him through that.

641
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:32,885
First he steals the ship with Johnny.

642
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:35,596
Then, in my draft at least,
they made a black flag.

643
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:39,683
Then the end battle was declaring war
against the world.

644
00:42:39,808 --> 00:42:42,436
It's a great journey for a character.

645
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:45,397
First he reviles pirates
and then he has to become one

646
00:42:45,522 --> 00:42:49,151
to rescue the love of his life.

647
00:42:51,653 --> 00:42:54,448
<i>It's an island that
cannot be found.</i>

648
00:42:55,657 --> 00:42:57,576
[Ted] Orlando's performance here

649
00:42:57,701 --> 00:43:02,873
just says everything
about this character.

650
00:43:02,998 --> 00:43:06,001
He doesn't wanna tell him
what the real reason is.

651
00:43:06,126 --> 00:43:09,338
The amount of anger in this guy

652
00:43:09,463 --> 00:43:12,341
and this character
comes through so well.

653
00:43:12,466 --> 00:43:15,135
[Terry] Part of what's fun
about Jack Sparrow is

654
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:20,182
he is aware of the notion
of storytelling while he's in the story.

655
00:43:20,307 --> 00:43:23,352
And right there,
he does a little bit of mocking

656
00:43:23,477 --> 00:43:27,856
the story that Will is in.

657
00:43:27,981 --> 00:43:30,400
Will is trying to be
the hero of his own tale

658
00:43:30,526 --> 00:43:32,903
and go off and rescue this fair maiden.

659
00:43:33,028 --> 00:43:36,031
Johnny's very aware
of not only what's happening,

660
00:43:36,156 --> 00:43:38,200
but how they will play in legend.

661
00:43:38,325 --> 00:43:41,870
[Ted] He understands clichés.
He plays off them very well.

662
00:43:41,995 --> 00:43:46,542
There's also, just in terms
of what it's like working on a script...

663
00:43:46,667 --> 00:43:48,836
We had done a couple of drafts

664
00:43:48,961 --> 00:43:53,257
and then we realized that it was
very important for a later scene

665
00:43:53,382 --> 00:43:59,179
that Will knew that the name of the
captain of the <i>Black Pearl</i> was Barbossa.

666
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:03,142
Then we realized there was no point
in the story prior to him knowing it

667
00:44:03,267 --> 00:44:06,395
that we established any way
he could have known it.

668
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,897
So we rewrote Johnny's dialogue there.

669
00:44:09,022 --> 00:44:14,153
Initially, when Will says,
"Where does it make berth?"

670
00:44:14,278 --> 00:44:19,158
He says, "Haven't you heard? It sails
from an island no one can find."

671
00:44:19,283 --> 00:44:21,326
And we changed it to,

672
00:44:21,451 --> 00:44:25,914
"Haven't you heard? Captain Barbossa
and his crew of miscreants," etc.

673
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:28,709
Johnny got the new pages and he goes,

674
00:44:28,834 --> 00:44:31,545
"I can't believe
you're giving me exposition."

675
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:35,257
The guy is canny.
He knew exactly what was going on.

676
00:44:35,382 --> 00:44:37,926
We said, "Yeah, OK, it is exposition."

677
00:44:38,051 --> 00:44:41,346
"But we gave you the word 'miscreants'."
And he goes, "OK."

678
00:44:41,471 --> 00:44:46,768
So he did it in that singsong, light
delivery that made it work so well.

679
00:44:47,269 --> 00:44:48,353
<i>Nautical term.</i>

680
00:44:49,021 --> 00:44:51,106
<i>One question about your business, boy,</i>

681
00:44:51,231 --> 00:44:52,608
<i>or there's no use going.</i>

682
00:44:54,234 --> 00:44:57,362
[Stuart] This stealing the big ship
to get the small ship

683
00:44:57,487 --> 00:44:59,865
is one of the things
that I'm most proud of.

684
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:01,700
Cause more than anything,

685
00:45:01,825 --> 00:45:06,413
this whole sequence
was from my draft.

686
00:45:06,538 --> 00:45:09,625
It's action, but it's action
informing character.

687
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:11,960
I knew they needed to steal a ship,

688
00:45:12,085 --> 00:45:15,255
which again was part of Will
slowly becoming a pirate.

689
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,925
How do they steal a ship?
OK, who are they?

690
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:22,971
Jack Sparrow's not just gonna steal
any ship. He wants the fast ship.

691
00:45:23,096 --> 00:45:27,976
Pirate ships were small and fast,
used to get away in, to hit and run.

692
00:45:28,101 --> 00:45:30,103
That was the pirates' specialty.

693
00:45:30,229 --> 00:45:35,651
This whole sequence was trying to say,
"The small, fast ship can't be taken."

694
00:45:35,776 --> 00:45:39,988
"Let's take the big ship,
which has very few guards."

695
00:45:40,113 --> 00:45:42,074
"Then they'll come out and chase us,

696
00:45:42,199 --> 00:45:45,827
and we'll take their ship
when they board our ship."

697
00:45:45,953 --> 00:45:49,498
Again, that helps define
these characters, it defines Jack.

698
00:45:49,623 --> 00:45:55,379
Half the fun is that Will
has no idea what Jack's doing

699
00:45:55,504 --> 00:45:58,382
and thinks, "This is insane.
We're gonna die."

700
00:45:58,507 --> 00:46:01,176
But Jack's one step ahead of everyone.

701
00:46:01,301 --> 00:46:02,970
<i>Aye! Avast!</i>

702
00:46:06,181 --> 00:46:08,517
<i>This ship cannot be crewed by two men.</i>

703
00:46:09,309 --> 00:46:11,186
<i>You'll never make it out of the bay.</i>

704
00:46:11,311 --> 00:46:12,854
<i>Son...</i>

705
00:46:13,897 --> 00:46:16,733
<i>I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.</i>

706
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:22,447
[Stuart] "I'm three steps ahead of you
and you don't even know it."

707
00:46:22,572 --> 00:46:26,034
And that's what we come to realize.

708
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:29,204
It's what's great about Norrington
thinking he's a joke.

709
00:46:29,329 --> 00:46:32,499
He's just the opposite,
cause he does the unexpected.

710
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:35,502
<i>Rash, Turner.</i>

711
00:46:35,627 --> 00:46:37,212
<i>Too rash.</i>

712
00:46:38,755 --> 00:46:42,968
<i>He is, without doubt,
the worst pirate I have ever seen.</i>

713
00:46:46,263 --> 00:46:47,556
<i>Here they come.</i>

714
00:46:47,973 --> 00:46:52,394
[Stuart] This always gets a good laugh
when people realize what he's doing.

715
00:47:02,571 --> 00:47:05,365
See, he knows what he's doing.

716
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:09,369
That's why you end up trusting him,
and... loving him.

717
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:11,955
Because he's got it all figured out,

718
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:17,210
as much of a buffoon as he pretends
to be, he's really very sharp.

719
00:47:17,336 --> 00:47:19,713
And he's getting everything he wants.

720
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:23,258
<i>Sailors, back to the Interceptor!
Now!</i>

721
00:47:29,097 --> 00:47:33,435
[Stuart] That was cleverly cut together,
the way it was directed and edited.

722
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:37,731
It gets it going to the point
and you get everything you need.

723
00:47:38,023 --> 00:47:43,362
Again, that's where you see he's
ten steps ahead of everyone else.

724
00:47:43,487 --> 00:47:47,741
That's the kind of thing that gets
you totally invested in the hero,

725
00:47:47,866 --> 00:47:50,410
which is paramount in these movies.

726
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:54,623
You've gotta care about the leads,
about whose story this is.

727
00:47:54,748 --> 00:47:57,125
The second you lose that,
you lose the audience

728
00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:02,631
and it just becomes
another loud, boring action film.

729
00:48:02,756 --> 00:48:06,468
One of the things that succeeds so well
in this story and in this movie

730
00:48:06,593 --> 00:48:10,722
is these characters are so great
and they stay in character.

731
00:48:13,642 --> 00:48:16,103
<i>That's got to be the best pirate
I've ever seen.</i>

732
00:48:17,312 --> 00:48:19,147
<i>So it would seem.</i>

733
00:48:30,283 --> 00:48:33,995
[Terry] In this scene,
Will has noticed

734
00:48:34,121 --> 00:48:37,666
Jack only started to agree with him
once he found something out.

735
00:48:37,791 --> 00:48:39,084
The audience noticed it.

736
00:48:39,209 --> 00:48:43,213
The rule is, if you have to
cue it to the audience,

737
00:48:43,338 --> 00:48:46,508
then let your lead character
clue into it too.

738
00:48:46,633 --> 00:48:51,304
Because that way he's at least
as smart as the audience members.

739
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:53,348
<i>You knew my father.</i>

740
00:48:59,521 --> 00:49:00,564
<i>I knew him.</i>

741
00:49:00,689 --> 00:49:03,567
<i>Probably one of the few
who knew him as William Turner.</i>

742
00:49:06,361 --> 00:49:10,615
[Stuart] I researched this when I wrote
<i>Quest Of The Caribbean</i> 12 years ago.

743
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:13,201
I watched all the old stories.

744
00:49:13,326 --> 00:49:16,913
<i>Captain Blood</i> and <i>The Sea Hawk,</i>
all of them.

745
00:49:17,038 --> 00:49:19,583
They were the ones that I was
trying to emulate.

746
00:49:19,708 --> 00:49:22,586
That tongue in cheek tone,

747
00:49:22,711 --> 00:49:27,507
but still with the real jeopardy,
real stakes going on.

748
00:49:27,632 --> 00:49:29,801
And I looked at less successful ones,

749
00:49:29,926 --> 00:49:32,554
<i>Cutthroat Island</i>
and <i>The Pirates Of The World,</i>

750
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:38,393
to make sure that I avoided
those pitfalls that those stories made.

751
00:49:38,518 --> 00:49:42,898
That was very much a part

752
00:49:43,023 --> 00:49:44,733
of making sure we got it right.

753
00:49:44,858 --> 00:49:48,320
You always wanna know
who your predecessors were,

754
00:49:48,445 --> 00:49:50,530
what shoulders you're standing on.

755
00:49:50,655 --> 00:49:55,327
So studying all those old films
is important.

756
00:49:55,911 --> 00:49:57,078
<i>For instance,</i>

757
00:49:57,204 --> 00:50:00,290
<i>you can accept that your father
was a pirate and a good man,</i>

758
00:50:00,415 --> 00:50:01,416
<i>or you can't.</i>

759
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:05,003
<i>Pirate is in your blood,
you'll have to square with that someday.</i>

760
00:50:05,921 --> 00:50:09,549
[Jay] The wonderful thing about a ship
is it has wonderful stuff.

761
00:50:09,674 --> 00:50:11,718
You've got great props to use.

762
00:50:11,843 --> 00:50:15,639
One of the happiest moments for me

763
00:50:15,764 --> 00:50:19,392
when I wrote my drafts

764
00:50:19,518 --> 00:50:23,480
was the utilization of how on a ship...

765
00:50:23,605 --> 00:50:26,441
A pirate ship is a collection of props.

766
00:50:26,566 --> 00:50:29,528
You can go on forever,
throwing stuff around.

767
00:50:29,653 --> 00:50:32,113
So it's great fun, it really is.

768
00:50:45,919 --> 00:50:49,673
[Stuart] This is the famous
Tortuga scene from the ride

769
00:50:49,798 --> 00:50:52,717
that we had to have in there somewhere.

770
00:50:52,842 --> 00:50:55,345
[Terry] Ride references coming up here.

771
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:57,973
[Ted] There was a guy
chasing a woman back there.

772
00:50:58,098 --> 00:51:00,308
There's the guy on the barrels.

773
00:51:00,433 --> 00:51:04,145
[Terry] The drinking out of the barrels
with the shots in them.

774
00:51:10,193 --> 00:51:14,656
[Ted] And this is the redhead. "We wants
the redhead" from the bride auction.

775
00:51:14,781 --> 00:51:19,160
If you look really closely, there's
a banner that says, "Buy a bride."

776
00:51:19,286 --> 00:51:23,665
And of course, back in the background
you can see others.

777
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:27,502
[Terry] This is the kind of place
where the pirates spent their money.

778
00:51:27,627 --> 00:51:31,631
Why there was never any buried treasure.
They spent it in these places.

779
00:51:32,257 --> 00:51:35,385
<i>Cursed y'are for breathing,
you slack-jawed idiot!</i>

780
00:51:37,721 --> 00:51:39,848
<i>Mother's love!</i>

781
00:51:40,557 --> 00:51:44,603
[Ted] We see Gibbs as a member
of the Royal Navy in the prologue.

782
00:51:44,728 --> 00:51:47,606
You don't ever expect
to see that guy again.

783
00:51:47,731 --> 00:51:53,361
Here he shows up, and he's now a pirate.
The guy who hated pirates is a pirate.

784
00:51:53,486 --> 00:51:58,116
We're just expecting the audience
to fill in this guy's story.

785
00:51:58,241 --> 00:52:02,245
[Terry] That's what's great. We give
no hint as to how that happened.

786
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:03,997
It's interesting that it did.

787
00:52:04,122 --> 00:52:09,252
[Ted] He's drinking, and not a
good sailor at the beginning.

788
00:52:09,377 --> 00:52:12,130
He has problems with Norrington
and with authority.

789
00:52:12,255 --> 00:52:15,675
And that's the only hints we give
to how he ends up.

790
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,719
People chasing in the background,

791
00:52:17,844 --> 00:52:22,390
but one thing you can't see
is the goat on the bar.

792
00:52:29,356 --> 00:52:32,984
<i>Now... what's the nature
of this venture of you'rn?</i>

793
00:52:34,819 --> 00:52:36,905
<i>I'm going after the</i> Black Pearl.

794
00:52:40,742 --> 00:52:44,079
<i>I know where it's going to be,
and I'm gonna take it.</i>

795
00:52:45,121 --> 00:52:48,500
<i>Jack, it's a fool's errand!</i>

796
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,963
[Ted] Again, this scene has a lot of

797
00:52:54,089 --> 00:52:59,678
tip of the iceberg
information woven in.

798
00:52:59,803 --> 00:53:02,430
There's been stories told.

799
00:53:02,555 --> 00:53:05,767
It goes back to the jail cell,
where the guy has heard stories.

800
00:53:05,892 --> 00:53:08,436
And Murtogg has heard stories

801
00:53:08,561 --> 00:53:11,981
and dismisses them as being not true.

802
00:53:12,107 --> 00:53:15,443
Here we feel Jack knows a lot more

803
00:53:15,568 --> 00:53:18,947
about the <i>Black Pearl</i>
and that situation.

804
00:53:19,072 --> 00:53:24,786
- [Terry] We also start to set up...
- [Ted] The leverage.

805
00:53:24,911 --> 00:53:27,706
[Terry] ...another key scene
that's coming up.

806
00:53:27,831 --> 00:53:30,208
Which is that,
at some point,

807
00:53:30,333 --> 00:53:34,921
Will has to understand
that he can't trust Jack.

808
00:53:35,046 --> 00:53:40,552
And that Jack doesn't have
his best interests at heart.

809
00:53:40,677 --> 00:53:45,140
There's also another reference
to the importance of the Turner name.

810
00:53:45,265 --> 00:53:49,144
All of which we're holding back,
but all of which is...

811
00:53:49,269 --> 00:53:52,230
[Ted] Being set up in this moment here.

812
00:53:54,983 --> 00:54:00,405
The toast they do here came from
the crew of the <i>Lady Washington.</i>

813
00:54:01,489 --> 00:54:04,200
When they're pulling into a dock,

814
00:54:04,325 --> 00:54:09,706
"Take what you can, give nothing back"
means pull in as much slack as you can

815
00:54:09,831 --> 00:54:11,374
and don't let it go.

816
00:54:11,499 --> 00:54:16,337
So it's an actual nautical reference
that was a perfect pirate toast.

817
00:54:23,386 --> 00:54:27,599
<i>You'll be dining with the captain,
and he requests you wear this.</i>

818
00:54:28,558 --> 00:54:32,187
<i>Tell the captain I'm disinclined
to acquiesce to his request.</i>

819
00:54:33,313 --> 00:54:34,773
[Ted] This was a lot of fun.

820
00:54:34,898 --> 00:54:37,442
[Terry] Our desire to get Keira

821
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:41,112
in as many great outfits
as possible takes over again.

822
00:54:41,237 --> 00:54:44,824
And here she gets to be
the pirate maiden.

823
00:54:47,035 --> 00:54:51,706
[Stuart] Women in pirate movies
have always been great.

824
00:54:51,831 --> 00:54:54,709
And fun. It's fun to write Elizabeth.

825
00:54:54,834 --> 00:54:58,338
She's feisty, she knows
what she's doing.

826
00:54:58,463 --> 00:55:01,049
She's independent, she's strong-willed,

827
00:55:01,174 --> 00:55:03,760
and doesn't care about
how she looks when she eats.

828
00:55:03,885 --> 00:55:07,013
It's a lot of fun to write.

829
00:55:07,138 --> 00:55:11,559
To put a woman into this mix
of cutthroats and scalawags

830
00:55:11,684 --> 00:55:16,898
and not have her just be standing
on the sidelines batting her eyelids.

831
00:55:17,023 --> 00:55:19,609
We wanted her much more
involved than that.

832
00:55:19,734 --> 00:55:25,240
We wanted her in the action, doing stuff
and very much a part of the plot.

833
00:55:25,365 --> 00:55:29,953
She is key. It's her being
kidnapped that triggers the story.

834
00:55:30,078 --> 00:55:34,332
Then it's Will's love for her
that gets the story going after that.

835
00:55:34,457 --> 00:55:37,126
People ask if this is an adventure
or a love story.

836
00:55:37,252 --> 00:55:40,046
I think it's a love story at heart.

837
00:55:40,171 --> 00:55:44,467
Because there wouldn't have been a story
if Will didn't love Elizabeth.

838
00:55:44,592 --> 00:55:49,097
It would have been Elizabeth
being kidnapped, full stop.

839
00:55:49,222 --> 00:55:52,433
But because he loves her
he goes to all these lengths.

840
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:55,812
That's what drives him, and the story.

841
00:55:55,937 --> 00:55:59,816
At the end of the day it's a love story
between these two people.

842
00:55:59,941 --> 00:56:03,987
Separated by class, then the worst
thing in the world happens,

843
00:56:04,112 --> 00:56:09,158
and it ends up being the one thing
they needed to get them together.

844
00:56:09,284 --> 00:56:12,412
That's good storytelling.

845
00:56:17,625 --> 00:56:22,297
[Ted] When Terry and I were working
on the technical aspects of this scene,

846
00:56:22,422 --> 00:56:28,303
one thing we knew was that we wanted to
have moments where people told stories.

847
00:56:28,428 --> 00:56:31,973
Stories about their lives
or about other characters.

848
00:56:32,098 --> 00:56:36,936
And this was one of the major ones,
the revelation of the curse

849
00:56:37,061 --> 00:56:42,483
and how the pirates discovered they
were cursed, and the effect that had.

850
00:56:42,609 --> 00:56:45,570
Basically this is a monologue.

851
00:56:45,695 --> 00:56:49,282
It's a three-page monologue
for Geoffrey.

852
00:56:50,325 --> 00:56:52,744
Then when Geoffrey came on board

853
00:56:52,869 --> 00:56:58,082
we must have spent 20 or 30 hours
with Geoffrey just on this scene,

854
00:56:58,207 --> 00:57:01,127
refining it as he
created his performance,

855
00:57:01,252 --> 00:57:04,172
as he came to understand
how he would perform it.

856
00:57:04,297 --> 00:57:09,010
And we came to understand
the information we need him to say

857
00:57:09,135 --> 00:57:14,724
and what he can do with a look
or a sneer or a lift of the lip.

858
00:57:14,849 --> 00:57:20,355
Geoffrey's process was that he
always wanted to discuss the scene,

859
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,816
talk about the scene, the character,
the lines, rehearse it,

860
00:57:23,942 --> 00:57:26,945
and I was amazed.

861
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:30,239
Long after I thought we had it,
he still wanted to refine it.

862
00:57:30,365 --> 00:57:35,119
- [Terry] It kept getting better.
- [Ted] I think it works. Also...

863
00:57:36,704 --> 00:57:41,501
...in this scene, there's a very
important part about the curse.

864
00:57:41,626 --> 00:57:46,422
Whoever takes a piece of gold
out of the chest becomes cursed.

865
00:57:46,547 --> 00:57:52,345
I don't know how people missed this,
because he emphasizes it once.

866
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:55,223
He talks about the chest,
and inside was the gold.

867
00:57:55,348 --> 00:57:56,349
"We took it all."

868
00:57:56,474 --> 00:58:00,853
[Terry] I love that we got to use the
word "slake" in the story there.

869
00:58:00,979 --> 00:58:05,066
"Slake our lust" is my favorite phrase.

870
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:14,575
Great performance by the monkey.

871
00:58:18,371 --> 00:58:20,665
<i>And the... blood to be repaid?</i>

872
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:23,251
<i>That's why there's no sense
to be killing ya.</i>

873
00:58:24,043 --> 00:58:25,044
<i>Yet.</i>

874
00:58:27,088 --> 00:58:28,589
<i>Apple?</i>

875
00:58:37,056 --> 00:58:39,767
[Terry] He actually says, "Arr".
I love that.

876
00:58:39,892 --> 00:58:44,105
Here's a key moment in terms
of the mechanics of the curse.

877
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:46,691
There is blood on this knife here.

878
00:58:46,816 --> 00:58:50,778
So the pirates, while they
cannot be killed, do bleed.

879
00:58:50,903 --> 00:58:53,031
And we made a very strong point of that,

880
00:58:53,156 --> 00:58:58,995
so it made sense to return the coins
with the blood repaid, so to speak.

881
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:02,206
[Stuart] This is a great reveal.

882
00:59:02,331 --> 00:59:05,460
Seeing the pirates in all their glory
and skeletons.

883
00:59:05,585 --> 00:59:08,004
Great moment.

884
00:59:08,129 --> 00:59:12,008
This scene is about putting a woman
in the middle of the action

885
00:59:12,133 --> 00:59:14,927
and seeing how she does.

886
00:59:17,847 --> 00:59:22,268
[Ted] The idea is not that the pirates
are actually skeletons

887
00:59:22,393 --> 00:59:25,855
who by daylight
look like they have flesh.

888
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:30,109
In daylight, in anything but moonlight,
they are flesh and blood.

889
00:59:30,234 --> 00:59:31,819
They're simply immortal.

890
00:59:31,944 --> 00:59:37,658
Whereas by moonlight
their real state is revealed,

891
00:59:37,784 --> 00:59:43,414
and this is basically a personification,
an embodiment of greed.

892
00:59:43,539 --> 00:59:47,376
These guys have been
starving and thirsty

893
00:59:47,502 --> 00:59:51,005
and frustrated for ten years.

894
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:53,508
[Stuart] That's a great monkey.

895
00:59:53,633 --> 00:59:57,220
By the way, you've gotta watch
the end of the credits

896
00:59:57,345 --> 01:00:01,349
to get the last little snippet
with the monkey.

897
01:00:01,474 --> 01:00:04,393
[Terry] Gore Verbinski had to fight
for this sequence,

898
01:00:04,519 --> 01:00:07,105
cause it is expensive and it's so key.

899
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:09,107
[Ted] The moonlight serenade.

900
01:00:09,232 --> 01:00:12,777
[Terry] The movie has
teased the whole notion

901
01:00:12,902 --> 01:00:15,363
of it being a ghost story

902
01:00:15,488 --> 01:00:19,033
and it being supernatural
for so long

903
01:00:19,158 --> 01:00:25,081
that it was time to come out and
give the audience a real taste of it.

904
01:00:25,206 --> 01:00:28,292
It's very powerful, I think,
that we have a villain

905
01:00:28,417 --> 01:00:30,711
who, in...

906
01:00:30,837 --> 01:00:35,842
...a profound way, is sympathetic
or at least in a sympathetic situation.

907
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:40,096
You actually feel bad
for the state that they're in

908
01:00:40,221 --> 01:00:43,266
and the amount of torment
that they've been through.

909
01:00:45,685 --> 01:00:47,895
[Jay] It's interesting about villains.

910
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:51,983
The most interesting villains
have contradictions.

911
01:00:52,108 --> 01:00:56,195
Deep down, they are not entirely
who they are showing us.

912
01:00:56,320 --> 01:01:01,534
In Geoffrey Rush's case, although
he's doing all these heinous things,

913
01:01:01,659 --> 01:01:07,540
there is a suspicion that he's
not a bad guy at the bottom of it all.

914
01:01:07,665 --> 01:01:10,501
There's a vulnerability about him.

915
01:01:10,626 --> 01:01:14,547
And after all, he's a man who is weary.

916
01:01:14,672 --> 01:01:19,427
He is weary of not living
and I think he lets that out.

917
01:01:19,552 --> 01:01:24,432
I have seen much bigger stinkers
in my life than Geoffrey Rush.

918
01:01:27,977 --> 01:01:32,607
[Ted] In terms of production, this was
probably the hardest thing to shoot,

919
01:01:32,732 --> 01:01:36,068
because we had this location
for exactly one day.

920
01:01:36,194 --> 01:01:40,114
And the scene as written was
at least a day and a half to shoot.

921
01:01:40,239 --> 01:01:44,035
You had all of these characters,
you had the bird.

922
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:47,205
You had to keep
all of the modern aspects out.

923
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:52,501
Just on the other side of the camera is
a town. There are cars driving around.

924
01:01:54,295 --> 01:01:58,507
[Stuart] Funny enough, in my old script
<i>The Quest of the Caribbean,</i>

925
01:01:58,633 --> 01:02:01,802
I had a mute and a parrot,
a parrot that talked.

926
01:02:01,928 --> 01:02:06,307
And I purposely didn't put
them in my script for legal reasons.

927
01:02:06,432 --> 01:02:08,768
And then they turned up anyway.

928
01:02:08,893 --> 01:02:12,355
Cause you can't have a pirate movie
without a mute and a parrot.

929
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:17,485
[Terry] The parrot was
actually necessary

930
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:21,489
because again there's some
ride references that need to be done.

931
01:02:21,614 --> 01:02:24,450
And having the parrot
say different lines

932
01:02:24,575 --> 01:02:27,620
gave us an access
back into the ride.

933
01:02:30,957 --> 01:02:34,210
[Ted] Anamaria's introduction
here is important

934
01:02:34,335 --> 01:02:38,297
because she is a woman pirate.

935
01:02:38,422 --> 01:02:40,258
It's really very simple.

936
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:44,345
[Terry] I always wonder if people
got the notion, or if it was clear,

937
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:48,224
that Anamaria's boat that Jack stole

938
01:02:48,349 --> 01:02:52,061
was the boat that sank at the start.

939
01:02:52,186 --> 01:02:55,982
Nor am I sure if it's clear that's why
Jack says yes to Anamaria,

940
01:02:56,107 --> 01:02:59,986
because he knows the storm is coming
and he's going to need

941
01:03:00,111 --> 01:03:02,196
every able-bodied person.

942
01:03:02,321 --> 01:03:05,533
[Ted] I think that he
knows the storm is coming is clear.

943
01:03:05,658 --> 01:03:10,538
Jack has a larger than life aspect.

944
01:03:10,663 --> 01:03:13,207
He is tied into things differently

945
01:03:13,332 --> 01:03:17,545
than the other mortal characters.

946
01:03:19,588 --> 01:03:23,217
This was miserable for the actors,
shooting this.

947
01:03:25,303 --> 01:03:29,682
This was actually out on real water,

948
01:03:29,807 --> 01:03:35,021
with fireboats spraying them down
at 3:00 in the morning. Not fun.

949
01:03:37,732 --> 01:03:39,692
<i>The compass doesn't point north,</i>

950
01:03:39,817 --> 01:03:42,570
<i>but we're not trying
to find north, are we?</i>

951
01:03:49,702 --> 01:03:52,747
[Stuart] I was ten when I saw
<i>Raiders Of The Lost Ark</i>

952
01:03:52,872 --> 01:03:56,500
and I thought it was the greatest film
ever and still do in many ways.

953
01:03:56,625 --> 01:04:00,796
That's what I was always trying
to emulate, but on the high seas.

954
01:04:00,921 --> 01:04:03,549
And, uh...

955
01:04:03,674 --> 01:04:07,803
...and that meant,
you know, real action.

956
01:04:07,928 --> 01:04:09,847
Real jeopardy, real stakes.

957
01:04:09,972 --> 01:04:14,810
A great bad guy,
and impossible odds.

958
01:04:20,608 --> 01:04:22,610
<i>Time to go, poppet.</i>

959
01:04:38,959 --> 01:04:42,838
[Ted] So Terry.
Was the <i>Black Pearl</i> actually cursed?

960
01:04:42,963 --> 01:04:46,592
Is there a curse of
the <i>Black Pearl?</i> On the <i>Black Pearl?</i>

961
01:04:46,717 --> 01:04:50,137
With the <i>Black Pearl?</i>
What's the story there?

962
01:04:50,262 --> 01:04:52,681
[Terry] Despite the subtitle,

963
01:04:52,807 --> 01:04:57,645
there is some question as to whether
the <i>Black Pearl</i> is a supernatural ship.

964
01:04:57,770 --> 01:05:02,775
Certainly the production design seemed
to allow it to move about very quickly

965
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:07,822
with sails that didn't seem as though
they would be all that functional.

966
01:05:07,947 --> 01:05:11,617
And wherever the <i>Black Pearl</i> goes,

967
01:05:11,742 --> 01:05:16,205
there is fog following it,
preceding it,

968
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:19,500
and certain environmental changes.

969
01:05:19,625 --> 01:05:25,172
But, technically speaking, the reason
the <i>Black Pearl</i> is the fastest ship

970
01:05:25,297 --> 01:05:28,092
is because it has the oars,

971
01:05:28,217 --> 01:05:32,638
and not necessarily
supernatural power.

972
01:05:32,763 --> 01:05:36,183
[ted] Although it does have
a supernatural aspect,

973
01:05:36,308 --> 01:05:38,269
even when it's under Jack's command.

974
01:05:38,394 --> 01:05:42,022
But that's not relevant to this story.

975
01:05:42,148 --> 01:05:47,194
[terry] That would be more a sequel.

976
01:05:47,319 --> 01:05:52,533
[Ted] Back when we were shooting the
stuff in Tortuga, talking to Orlando,

977
01:05:52,658 --> 01:05:55,119
I mentioned it would be fun,
at some point,

978
01:05:55,244 --> 01:06:00,374
if Will imitated
Jack in his delivery.

979
01:06:00,499 --> 01:06:03,711
I just meant if he gave
a little twist to the words.

980
01:06:03,836 --> 01:06:05,212
Later, Orlando said,

981
01:06:05,337 --> 01:06:10,134
"It'd be more fun
to actually imitate his movements."

982
01:06:10,259 --> 01:06:13,429
And so he suggested that
to Jerry Bruckheimer.

983
01:06:13,554 --> 01:06:19,435
Jerry was worried that people understand
what's wrong with Jack Sparrow.

984
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:23,856
Why does he act like that?
Why is he so goofy?

985
01:06:23,981 --> 01:06:26,942
So then we got the note

986
01:06:27,067 --> 01:06:31,906
that there has to be a place where Will
does this physical imitation of Jack.

987
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:36,660
And we realized it would work
in this scene,

988
01:06:36,785 --> 01:06:40,331
because it is a scene where Gibbs
talks about Jack.

989
01:06:40,456 --> 01:06:43,876
Will is asking a question about him.

990
01:06:44,001 --> 01:06:49,507
The most difficult line I had to write
was Gibbs' response to Will's question.

991
01:06:49,632 --> 01:06:53,385
He says, "Is that why he's...?"
and he does the imitation.

992
01:06:53,511 --> 01:06:56,096
The response, "Reason's got
nothing to do with it"

993
01:06:56,222 --> 01:06:58,349
was the single, hardest line
we wrote.

994
01:06:58,474 --> 01:07:02,436
Because it had to allow Gibbs
to get back to the story.

995
01:07:02,561 --> 01:07:05,272
And in a way,

996
01:07:05,397 --> 01:07:09,068
I hate to put
it this way, but it also...

997
01:07:09,193 --> 01:07:11,445
...a reason is given, heatstroke...

998
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:13,948
...left on an island,
that Jerry wanted.

999
01:07:14,073 --> 01:07:18,536
And then we immediately negate that
as the reason why Jack is the way he is.

1000
01:07:18,661 --> 01:07:20,329
[Terry] But that works.

1001
01:07:20,454 --> 01:07:25,167
All the audience
needs is a possible explanation.

1002
01:07:25,292 --> 01:07:29,797
Of course the fun is, is Jack
sunstroked? Is he drunk?

1003
01:07:29,922 --> 01:07:33,676
Is he sly like a fox? Is he crazy?

1004
01:07:33,801 --> 01:07:38,264
[Ted] As always, he's the trickster.
You can't pin this guy down.

1005
01:07:38,389 --> 01:07:40,724
It's just not his nature.

1006
01:07:42,726 --> 01:07:46,313
[Stuart] He'd decided pirates
were like rock stars in their day.

1007
01:07:46,438 --> 01:07:49,316
Who's the greatest rock star?
Keith Richards.

1008
01:07:49,441 --> 01:07:52,486
And he got out the eyeliner
and a mouthful of gold teeth,

1009
01:07:52,611 --> 01:07:56,991
which they scaled back to one or two
gold teeth, but that was it.

1010
01:07:57,116 --> 01:08:00,869
What's great is he gives just enough
looks every now and then

1011
01:08:00,995 --> 01:08:03,497
to let you know that he's
ten steps ahead of you.

1012
01:08:03,622 --> 01:08:07,876
And that he really is calculating,
he knows what's going on.

1013
01:08:15,884 --> 01:08:21,181
[Terry] One of the fun things we
realized in doing this story structure,

1014
01:08:21,307 --> 01:08:24,685
pirates are always associated
with buried treasure.

1015
01:08:24,810 --> 01:08:29,148
Taking treasure, putting it in a cave,
burying it, coming back later.

1016
01:08:29,273 --> 01:08:31,483
But there's not a lot of logic to that.

1017
01:08:31,609 --> 01:08:35,404
Here, we give a reasonable explanation

1018
01:08:35,529 --> 01:08:38,240
for where the legends may come from.

1019
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:46,707
[Stuart] Smaller characters
can provide a lot of color

1020
01:08:46,832 --> 01:08:49,376
to a script and make it whole.

1021
01:08:49,501 --> 01:08:53,130
A lot of your greatest laughs
are from side characters.

1022
01:08:53,255 --> 01:08:55,716
So they're very important
to keep aware of.

1023
01:08:55,841 --> 01:08:59,803
I always populate my stories
with those characters

1024
01:08:59,928 --> 01:09:03,474
and not just think about
the main people.

1025
01:09:03,599 --> 01:09:06,352
That gives you a more complete world.

1026
01:09:08,354 --> 01:09:11,398
Here are more homage's to the ride.

1027
01:09:11,523 --> 01:09:16,362
We knew we wanted a boat in a cavern
and a crab and a guy with a skull

1028
01:09:16,487 --> 01:09:19,823
cause that's one of
the iconic images of the ride.

1029
01:09:19,948 --> 01:09:22,576
[Ted] That moment is designed

1030
01:09:22,701 --> 01:09:26,580
from one of Mark Davis's
original sketches for the ride.

1031
01:09:26,705 --> 01:09:29,625
Mark Davis was one of the Imagineers,

1032
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:35,255
actually the guy who really created
the <i>Pirates Of The Caribbean</i> ride.

1033
01:09:35,381 --> 01:09:38,759
[Terry] That was a case
where we actually needed a cue

1034
01:09:38,884 --> 01:09:42,805
to bring up the notion of betrayal
that is on Will's mind.

1035
01:09:42,930 --> 01:09:47,267
But how to justify him bringing it up?

1036
01:09:47,393 --> 01:09:50,729
We went to the ride
and looked at different images

1037
01:09:50,854 --> 01:09:54,817
and said, "Well, here's a skeleton
with a sword stabbed in his back."

1038
01:09:58,278 --> 01:10:02,032
[Stuart] In my draft, we had a whole
scenario of how they got in there

1039
01:10:02,157 --> 01:10:06,078
and there were traps all through
this place, in this <i>Isla de Muerta.</i>

1040
01:10:06,203 --> 01:10:08,872
It was like <i>Raiders Of The Lost Ark.</i>

1041
01:10:08,997 --> 01:10:13,085
But in the end,
it just delayed the story.

1042
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:17,798
You wanted to get in there, get to
the treasure, and keep the story moving.

1043
01:10:22,970 --> 01:10:26,056
This was on a sound stage at Disney.
In Burbank.

1044
01:10:33,355 --> 01:10:36,358
[Terry] Here we do justify
this treasure.

1045
01:10:36,483 --> 01:10:39,361
They've been gathering
treasure they can't spend,

1046
01:10:39,486 --> 01:10:42,865
sifting through it to find these coins.

1047
01:10:42,990 --> 01:10:47,369
[Ted] And they've been robbing ships
to return the coins to this chest,

1048
01:10:47,494 --> 01:10:51,832
because the curse can only be lifted
if all of the gold is returned

1049
01:10:51,957 --> 01:10:55,502
and if all those who have taken
gold out contribute blood back.

1050
01:10:55,627 --> 01:10:58,046
Of course at this point they believe

1051
01:10:58,172 --> 01:11:01,008
that Elizabeth...

1052
01:11:01,133 --> 01:11:03,844
...has blood they need.

1053
01:11:03,969 --> 01:11:06,221
[Stuart] At this moment Jack knows

1054
01:11:06,346 --> 01:11:10,017
the curse won't be lifted
with Elizabeth's blood.

1055
01:11:10,142 --> 01:11:12,519
[Ted] He knows it's
Will's blood they need.

1056
01:11:12,644 --> 01:11:15,564
[Stuart] He's off to bargain
with Barbossa,

1057
01:11:15,689 --> 01:11:18,692
keep Will out of the picture...

1058
01:11:18,817 --> 01:11:22,571
[Ted] And sell Will out.
In exchange for the Pearl.

1059
01:11:26,241 --> 01:11:28,035
They've all given blood.

1060
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:30,829
[Stuart] Geoffrey Rush's
eyeballs deserve...

1061
01:11:30,954 --> 01:11:34,041
[Ted] An Academy Award
nomination, absolutely.

1062
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,960
His performance...

1063
01:11:37,085 --> 01:11:42,382
...the match between he and Johnny
is perfect. It works so well.

1064
01:11:42,508 --> 01:11:46,178
Barbossa is the dark side
of Jack Sparrow in a big way.

1065
01:12:01,151 --> 01:12:04,154
Here's our hero...

1066
01:12:04,279 --> 01:12:07,699
...knocking out Jack Sparrow
and leaving him to the pirates.

1067
01:12:07,825 --> 01:12:11,954
Imagine if Luke Skywalker
had knocked out Han Solo

1068
01:12:12,079 --> 01:12:15,833
and left him to the mercy of
Darth Vader? That's not gonna work.

1069
01:12:15,958 --> 01:12:19,878
[Stuart] He's a more substantial
than the usual straight character.

1070
01:12:20,003 --> 01:12:23,006
[Ted] I was talking, in terms of,
"Is that going to work?"

1071
01:12:23,131 --> 01:12:25,884
setting up the idea
they're gonna cut her throat.

1072
01:12:26,009 --> 01:12:29,054
But they don't. They cut her hand.

1073
01:12:29,179 --> 01:12:32,140
The real important thing is,
at this point,

1074
01:12:32,266 --> 01:12:38,063
Will is still operating under
societal constraints.

1075
01:12:38,188 --> 01:12:42,025
He has not yet accepted piracy

1076
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:44,528
as a necessity in his life, obviously.

1077
01:12:44,653 --> 01:12:48,240
He's late. He doesn't get there in time.

1078
01:12:48,365 --> 01:12:50,868
He doesn't save the girl.

1079
01:12:52,995 --> 01:12:56,623
It's only because
of Geoffrey's character

1080
01:12:56,748 --> 01:12:58,250
that she's still alive.

1081
01:12:58,375 --> 01:13:02,004
The whole "waste not" idea.

1082
01:13:02,129 --> 01:13:05,090
This was our spoof
on all those movies where,

1083
01:13:05,215 --> 01:13:09,720
to establish how evil the villain is,
he shoots one of his own henchmen.

1084
01:13:09,845 --> 01:13:14,308
I've always thought that's a reason
why they would have no more henchmen.

1085
01:13:14,433 --> 01:13:19,813
But here we actually could justify one
and they still stick around.

1086
01:13:19,938 --> 01:13:23,400
But it does presage a possible mutiny.

1087
01:13:23,525 --> 01:13:25,736
<i>Was your father William Turner?</i>

1088
01:13:26,653 --> 01:13:29,740
[Ted] I'm just pointing out here...

1089
01:13:30,657 --> 01:13:34,786
...Barbossa takes the coin out
of the chest. He's already cursed.

1090
01:13:34,912 --> 01:13:38,373
Elizabeth isn't cursed.
She did not take a coin out.

1091
01:13:38,498 --> 01:13:43,045
But there goes the coin that was taken
from the chest, the medallion itself.

1092
01:13:43,170 --> 01:13:46,214
I just had to point that out.

1093
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:52,179
[Terry] It does track. But why aren't
those other coins stained with blood?

1094
01:13:52,304 --> 01:13:57,517
I guess once it goes in, the blood
must dissipate somehow, magically.

1095
01:13:57,643 --> 01:14:01,355
[Ted] Not all of them have to be
stained. There aren't 882 crew members.

1096
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:06,443
- [Terry] But the others have no blood.
- [Ted] The blood is all at the bottom.

1097
01:14:06,568 --> 01:14:11,073
It's like a parfait, Terry.
Everybody loves a parfait.

1098
01:14:14,910 --> 01:14:18,038
Here was something really funny.

1099
01:14:18,163 --> 01:14:21,208
The monkey was trained
to point with his other hand.

1100
01:14:21,333 --> 01:14:26,713
So when we were shooting the sequence,
they couldn't shoot the monkey pointing.

1101
01:14:26,838 --> 01:14:30,258
They actually, uh,
Mark and Ursula,

1102
01:14:30,384 --> 01:14:33,512
the animal trainers,
had to work for like three weeks,

1103
01:14:33,637 --> 01:14:36,890
training the monkey
to point with that hand.

1104
01:14:37,015 --> 01:14:38,976
There's the realities of production.

1105
01:14:39,101 --> 01:14:44,398
You can have stunt monkeys, you can
have double monkeys, backup monkeys.

1106
01:14:44,523 --> 01:14:47,693
But if you don't have one
that can point with his right hand,

1107
01:14:47,818 --> 01:14:49,569
that'll stall the production.

1108
01:14:49,695 --> 01:14:53,240
[Terry] Funny how Barbossa looks
to the monkey, the monkey points,

1109
01:14:53,365 --> 01:14:56,201
Barbossa understands
what the monkey means.

1110
01:14:56,326 --> 01:15:00,539
And he then has the ability to
not only see that Elizabeth is gone,

1111
01:15:00,664 --> 01:15:03,041
but notice that the coin,

1112
01:15:03,166 --> 01:15:06,753
amongst all that gold,
the key medallion is also missing.

1113
01:15:06,878 --> 01:15:09,923
[Ted] They're looking for oars,
and here's the only one.

1114
01:15:10,048 --> 01:15:14,302
It's the one that Will used
to knock out Jack.

1115
01:15:14,428 --> 01:15:16,096
<i>You're supposed to be dead!</i>

1116
01:15:16,221 --> 01:15:17,472
<i>Am I not?</i>

1117
01:15:20,308 --> 01:15:25,856
[Ted] I also like that Jack is suffering
from having been hit on the head.

1118
01:15:25,981 --> 01:15:29,609
He doesn't immediately recover.

1119
01:15:36,908 --> 01:15:39,661
<i>...parsnip... pars-ley...</i>

1120
01:15:39,786 --> 01:15:41,747
<i>...Partner, pardoner...</i>

1121
01:15:41,872 --> 01:15:42,789
<i>Parley?</i>

1122
01:15:42,914 --> 01:15:44,708
<i>That's the one! Parley!</i>

1123
01:15:45,459 --> 01:15:46,460
<i>Parley!</i>

1124
01:15:46,585 --> 01:15:47,794
<i>Parley?!</i>

1125
01:15:49,046 --> 01:15:52,841
<i>Damn to the depths whatever
muttonhead thought up parley!</i>

1126
01:15:54,468 --> 01:15:56,803
<i>That would be the French.</i>

1127
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:02,309
[ted] When Terry and I set out
to write this story,

1128
01:16:02,434 --> 01:16:04,936
we wanted to recapture the feel

1129
01:16:05,062 --> 01:16:10,108
of those classic Hollywood
swashbucklers.

1130
01:16:10,233 --> 01:16:13,361
One missing element was the turns,

1131
01:16:13,487 --> 01:16:17,115
these great turns for character actors.

1132
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:20,285
You don't see a lot of that,

1133
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:24,456
particularly in summer movies.

1134
01:16:24,581 --> 01:16:28,126
These wonderful character turns
are just sprinkled throughout.

1135
01:16:28,251 --> 01:16:32,547
When we were working
on the script we pretended

1136
01:16:32,672 --> 01:16:38,512
that we had a whole studio full of
great character actors under contract.

1137
01:16:38,637 --> 01:16:42,224
So, if, you know,
it was like, um...

1138
01:16:42,349 --> 01:16:46,394
...with Murtogg and Mullroy
the idea with those two guys was,

1139
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:51,775
we had this vaudeville team
with one really famous routine.

1140
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:56,029
Put them in the movie as the guards,
we adapt the routine to pirate legend,

1141
01:16:56,154 --> 01:16:59,407
and play it that way.

1142
01:16:59,533 --> 01:17:04,246
And while writing Gibbs, we always
thought, "This is the Alan Hale role."

1143
01:17:06,206 --> 01:17:08,125
[Terry] Then Pintel and Ragetti.

1144
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:13,713
Again they just came together
and played off each other so well.

1145
01:17:17,467 --> 01:17:20,137
[Ted] Every actor so loved
doing this movie.

1146
01:17:20,262 --> 01:17:24,975
They got to all be pirates.
How often are you gonna get that chance?

1147
01:17:28,645 --> 01:17:30,522
<i>I know whose blood you need.</i>

1148
01:17:30,981 --> 01:17:34,151
[Terry] There goes the chess match
between those two again.

1149
01:17:34,276 --> 01:17:38,238
That idea of the two gods
coming together and battling it out.

1150
01:17:38,363 --> 01:17:41,158
And the mortals just have to look on.

1151
01:17:43,702 --> 01:17:45,954
Usually when Ted and I work together

1152
01:17:46,079 --> 01:17:49,708
what we do in terms of process
is work out the structure.

1153
01:17:49,833 --> 01:17:55,422
In this case, in terms of
writing the structure of the movie,

1154
01:17:55,547 --> 01:18:00,260
as a writing partnership,
we will typically divide up scenes.

1155
01:18:00,385 --> 01:18:02,596
We'll write them on our own, then trade.

1156
01:18:02,721 --> 01:18:07,434
The main thing is that the scenes
be worked out to fit into the whole

1157
01:18:07,559 --> 01:18:10,562
before they can actually be written
in first-draft form.

1158
01:18:15,275 --> 01:18:17,903
[Stuart] I have five rules
of screenwriting.

1159
01:18:18,028 --> 01:18:21,031
Rule number four is always
save the kiss to the end.

1160
01:18:21,156 --> 01:18:24,242
Keep that tension
going all the way through.

1161
01:18:24,367 --> 01:18:27,120
Will they or won't they?

1162
01:18:27,245 --> 01:18:31,249
So always save the kiss to the end.

1163
01:18:31,374 --> 01:18:35,295
The other four rules...
Number one is no bookends.

1164
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:40,133
Number two is no bookends.
Number three is never kill the dog.

1165
01:18:40,258 --> 01:18:42,802
Number four, save the kiss 'til the end.

1166
01:18:42,928 --> 01:18:46,056
Number five is feel free to
disagree with all these rules.

1167
01:18:47,015 --> 01:18:48,475
<i>It was a gift from my father.</i>

1168
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:50,644
<i>He sent it to me.</i>

1169
01:18:56,316 --> 01:18:57,859
<i>Why did you take it?</i>

1170
01:18:59,986 --> 01:19:02,739
<i>Because I was afraid
that you were a pirate!</i>

1171
01:19:04,324 --> 01:19:06,117
<i>That would've been awful!</i>

1172
01:19:09,579 --> 01:19:11,373
<i>It wasn't your blood they needed.</i>

1173
01:19:14,167 --> 01:19:16,419
<i>It was my father's blood.</i>

1174
01:19:19,798 --> 01:19:23,093
[Ted] There's one funny thing
about this movie.

1175
01:19:23,218 --> 01:19:27,180
The one thing we talked about the most
in terms of individual scenes

1176
01:19:27,305 --> 01:19:29,349
if I wrote a scene
and handed it to you

1177
01:19:29,474 --> 01:19:33,853
and you then had notes on it...

1178
01:19:33,979 --> 01:19:38,775
...the one thing we talked about most
was the rhythm of the dialogue.

1179
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:43,822
It wasn't so much the specific words,
it was always about rhythm.

1180
01:19:43,947 --> 01:19:48,034
There's a moment
with Johnny coming up

1181
01:19:48,159 --> 01:19:50,704
that was really fun to work out.

1182
01:19:50,829 --> 01:19:54,624
What we had written,
he didn't really like.

1183
01:19:54,749 --> 01:19:57,794
And... we basically said,

1184
01:19:57,919 --> 01:20:01,548
"The only important thing
is the rhythm of the dialogue.

1185
01:20:01,673 --> 01:20:05,802
It just needs to match that rhythm."
I'll point that out when we get to it.

1186
01:20:05,927 --> 01:20:10,307
And this again is the two gods.
They think the same.

1187
01:20:10,432 --> 01:20:13,852
They act the same.
They have the same concerns.

1188
01:20:13,977 --> 01:20:19,399
They're both trying to create a deal
with loopholes and to cover them

1189
01:20:19,524 --> 01:20:23,361
and figure out how to come to an accord
they'll both be happy with.

1190
01:20:23,486 --> 01:20:28,366
[Terry] What I love about this scene is
that Johnny is in such a weak position.

1191
01:20:28,491 --> 01:20:30,952
We know it, he knows it,
Barbossa knows it.

1192
01:20:31,077 --> 01:20:33,413
All he's got is his mouth

1193
01:20:33,538 --> 01:20:37,834
to keep him going in what he says.

1194
01:20:37,959 --> 01:20:41,796
And instead of actually...

1195
01:20:41,921 --> 01:20:44,132
recognizing that he's
in a weak position,

1196
01:20:44,257 --> 01:20:47,260
he decides to go
the complete opposite way.

1197
01:20:47,385 --> 01:20:51,306
He'll presume that he's in charge,
that he's offering a great deal,

1198
01:20:51,431 --> 01:20:55,101
that everything should be fine, but...

1199
01:20:55,226 --> 01:21:00,940
Another Warner Brothers moment.
It's such an act of bravado.

1200
01:21:07,447 --> 01:21:12,952
[Stuart] I wrote the first draft
in five weeks, the second in eight days.

1201
01:21:13,078 --> 01:21:16,289
There was a rush, we needed to
get the script to Johnny Depp.

1202
01:21:16,414 --> 01:21:19,084
So, um, you work
with what you've got.

1203
01:21:19,209 --> 01:21:23,963
They're saying, "This is what I need."
Your next job depends on you doing it.

1204
01:21:24,089 --> 01:21:28,635
That's how Hollywood works once
you start getting credits going,

1205
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:31,971
once you start getting films made.
People pay attention,

1206
01:21:32,097 --> 01:21:37,143
and they believe you know more
than you knew yesterday.

1207
01:21:37,268 --> 01:21:40,730
A lot of what we do
is called writing on assignment

1208
01:21:40,855 --> 01:21:42,899
and that's what <i>Pirates</i> was.

1209
01:21:43,024 --> 01:21:45,985
It was an idea conceived
by the Disney executives

1210
01:21:46,111 --> 01:21:49,030
and they brought us in
to work on assignment,

1211
01:21:49,155 --> 01:21:52,158
to write a script for them.

1212
01:21:54,786 --> 01:21:57,997
[Ted] Here is Elizabeth.

1213
01:21:58,123 --> 01:22:01,668
She's learned about pirates,
which is how she learned about ships.

1214
01:22:01,793 --> 01:22:07,590
She's the one who's out there creating
strategy that is equal to Barbossa's.

1215
01:22:07,715 --> 01:22:12,178
Again Will and Elizabeth,
the various mortal characters,

1216
01:22:12,303 --> 01:22:16,975
have the potential to match Jack
and Barbossa, if they can achieve that.

1217
01:22:19,102 --> 01:22:22,355
Neither of us are
experts at sailing,

1218
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:25,400
but it was fun to learn about it,

1219
01:22:25,525 --> 01:22:29,863
to learn the commands
and the maneuvers that are done.

1220
01:22:29,988 --> 01:22:32,073
Particularly the clubhaul maneuver.

1221
01:22:32,198 --> 01:22:35,827
That's a real maneuver that would
be effective in this situation.

1222
01:22:35,952 --> 01:22:39,706
[Ted] The strategies used... there's
one moment where I wonder, hmm.

1223
01:22:39,831 --> 01:22:43,042
But the strategies used in this battle

1224
01:22:43,168 --> 01:22:45,837
are actually pretty legitimate.

1225
01:22:45,962 --> 01:22:51,050
At least the crew
of the Lady Washington

1226
01:22:51,176 --> 01:22:55,305
and our historical advisor
and our sailmaster

1227
01:22:55,430 --> 01:22:58,308
thought they were OK.

1228
01:22:58,433 --> 01:23:02,645
It was one of those things
where we felt quiet pride.

1229
01:23:02,770 --> 01:23:05,773
I guess not so quiet.

1230
01:23:05,899 --> 01:23:09,068
The sweeps we borrowed
from Captain Kidd's ship.

1231
01:23:09,194 --> 01:23:13,823
Captain Kidd's ship actually had
a galley with oars in it.

1232
01:23:13,948 --> 01:23:18,953
So, that's not made up,
that's actually historically accurate.

1233
01:23:22,248 --> 01:23:24,000
<i>Anything! Everything!</i>

1234
01:23:24,125 --> 01:23:25,793
<i>Anything we have left!</i>

1235
01:23:28,630 --> 01:23:33,760
[Ted] Will is taking control of
the fight, which is what he knows,

1236
01:23:33,885 --> 01:23:36,888
and Elizabeth is in control of the ship,

1237
01:23:37,013 --> 01:23:42,435
the piracy, the strategy itself,
which is what she knows.

1238
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:46,105
[Terry] I love the expression that, uh,

1239
01:23:46,231 --> 01:23:50,527
matches between the monkey
and Geoffrey Rush

1240
01:23:50,652 --> 01:23:54,697
when he first has the suspicion

1241
01:23:54,822 --> 01:23:59,744
that they're gonna
do the clubhaul maneuver.

1242
01:23:59,869 --> 01:24:02,872
It's just one of those great
matching moments.

1243
01:24:02,997 --> 01:24:07,377
[Ted] I love the implication
that everyone got

1244
01:24:07,502 --> 01:24:09,462
what she was suggesting right away

1245
01:24:09,587 --> 01:24:13,049
and they're going, "Oh, God, that's..."

1246
01:24:13,174 --> 01:24:16,386
And also it's very important that...
daft like Jack.

1247
01:24:16,511 --> 01:24:19,264
That's an important moment
for Elizabeth.

1248
01:24:19,389 --> 01:24:22,559
[Terry] The maneuver is
one of desperation.

1249
01:24:22,684 --> 01:24:26,354
[Ted] You're gonna lose that anchor,
at the very least.

1250
01:24:26,479 --> 01:24:31,943
I love the fact that the monkey
figures it out a bit ahead of Barbossa.

1251
01:24:39,492 --> 01:24:40,743
<i>Let go!</i>

1252
01:24:42,287 --> 01:24:48,042
[Ted] That is the best position that
you could be in a ship-to-ship battle.

1253
01:24:48,167 --> 01:24:49,711
[Terry] They don't have ball.

1254
01:24:49,836 --> 01:24:53,172
[Ted] The language they use,
firing whatever they can,

1255
01:24:53,298 --> 01:24:57,468
cut glass and silverware,
is more like a neutron bomb.

1256
01:24:57,594 --> 01:25:00,513
It's designed not to do damage
to the ship,

1257
01:25:00,638 --> 01:25:03,224
but to do maximum damage

1258
01:25:03,349 --> 01:25:07,228
to the other people on the ship.

1259
01:25:07,353 --> 01:25:12,400
[Stuart] Sea battles were
violent, violent experiences.

1260
01:25:12,525 --> 01:25:15,528
That was a great shot of the men

1261
01:25:15,653 --> 01:25:18,906
looking at each other
through the gunports.

1262
01:25:19,032 --> 01:25:23,119
Cannons in these days weren't
accurate, so you had to get close.

1263
01:25:23,244 --> 01:25:28,458
And cannonballs
were disastrous on wood.

1264
01:25:28,583 --> 01:25:32,045
That's what they're firing,
iron against wood.

1265
01:25:32,170 --> 01:25:34,922
[Ted] I'm convinced Gore wanted

1266
01:25:35,048 --> 01:25:38,384
a pirate with a wooden eyeball
just for this gag.

1267
01:25:38,509 --> 01:25:42,722
I am convinced that was
where it came from.

1268
01:25:42,847 --> 01:25:45,224
"He's got a wooden eye,
we'll fire forks.

1269
01:25:45,350 --> 01:25:47,060
Yes, I like that."

1270
01:25:50,146 --> 01:25:53,566
[Stuart] The standard practice
in naval warfare was...

1271
01:25:53,691 --> 01:25:56,736
...usually there were three
or four ships per side.

1272
01:25:56,861 --> 01:25:59,238
The ships would line up
in opposite sides

1273
01:25:59,364 --> 01:26:03,743
and slowly sail by each other
in two big lines that crossed.

1274
01:26:03,868 --> 01:26:06,621
And they would shoot
and shoot and shoot

1275
01:26:06,746 --> 01:26:11,167
and the decks would
be awash in blood and rigging.

1276
01:26:11,292 --> 01:26:14,754
These were nasty places to fight.

1277
01:26:14,879 --> 01:26:20,802
Once one of the ships was disabled,
you'd have the boarding taking place.

1278
01:26:20,927 --> 01:26:24,389
Which is what happens next.

1279
01:26:24,514 --> 01:26:28,059
This is combat at sea,
a fraction of what it looked like.

1280
01:26:28,184 --> 01:26:31,479
The reality was much more gory,
but we can't show that.

1281
01:26:31,604 --> 01:26:36,192
This is a PG-13. We want
young teens to be able to go see this.

1282
01:26:36,317 --> 01:26:40,571
It's not an accurate reflection
of piracy, but that wasn't our aim.

1283
01:26:40,697 --> 01:26:45,159
Our aim was an accurate reflection
of the romantic image of piracy,

1284
01:26:45,284 --> 01:26:50,373
which started with Lord Byron
and a poem called <i>The Corsair.</i>

1285
01:26:50,498 --> 01:26:54,544
This cannonball is chainlink cannonball.

1286
01:26:54,669 --> 01:26:57,755
There were several
different kinds of shot

1287
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:01,300
that cannons used.

1288
01:27:01,426 --> 01:27:04,804
And that cannon,
the two balls linked by chain,

1289
01:27:04,929 --> 01:27:09,726
was used to take down masts,
as you'll see, take down the rigging.

1290
01:27:09,851 --> 01:27:12,311
And there was grapeshot...

1291
01:27:12,437 --> 01:27:18,234
...all different kinds, designed to
inflict various kinds of destruction.

1292
01:27:18,359 --> 01:27:22,697
Taking down a sail's rigging
meant disabling a ship.

1293
01:27:22,822 --> 01:27:24,741
That gave you a huge advantage.

1294
01:27:24,866 --> 01:27:26,909
It often decided
the fate of the battle.

1295
01:27:27,034 --> 01:27:30,037
Now they can board the ship,

1296
01:27:30,163 --> 01:27:34,041
that ship's not going anywhere
and they can do what they want to it.

1297
01:27:34,167 --> 01:27:38,504
Rigging was as much a target
as the guys on the other side.

1298
01:27:38,629 --> 01:27:42,300
Once you immobilize them,
you're in the middle of the water.

1299
01:27:42,425 --> 01:27:46,137
Where are you gonna go?
It's not like you can just flee.

1300
01:27:46,262 --> 01:27:49,182
Once you take down that mast,
you are stuck out there.

1301
01:27:49,307 --> 01:27:54,479
And in fact one of the things
seafarers feared most

1302
01:27:54,604 --> 01:27:58,483
was the mast collapsing
or sails ripping

1303
01:27:58,608 --> 01:28:00,943
or just being stuck out at sea.

1304
01:28:01,068 --> 01:28:03,112
Because you would go nuts,
literally.

1305
01:28:03,237 --> 01:28:08,826
You couldn't move and you're too far
away to swim, not that most could.

1306
01:28:08,951 --> 01:28:12,997
You would go through all the food
and end up eating each other

1307
01:28:13,122 --> 01:28:15,833
and then end up going insane,
drinking seawater.

1308
01:28:15,958 --> 01:28:19,670
So, for a lot of seafarers
of this time,

1309
01:28:19,796 --> 01:28:22,548
that was a worse fate than dying.

1310
01:28:22,673 --> 01:28:27,553
To be stuck out on a ship that was stuck
on the water, dead on the water.

1311
01:28:27,678 --> 01:28:32,308
There's a reason they call it a dead
calm. There's nothing to get you moving.

1312
01:28:32,433 --> 01:28:36,562
You could die out there,
unless you get a breeze.

1313
01:28:46,155 --> 01:28:49,242
These ships are very accurate
to the time periods.

1314
01:28:49,367 --> 01:28:52,411
Pirates liked to sail small, fast ships.

1315
01:28:52,537 --> 01:28:57,792
Hit and run was their specialty.

1316
01:28:57,917 --> 01:29:00,753
And so the smaller the ship,
the faster the ship.

1317
01:29:00,878 --> 01:29:03,798
The big warships, the galleons,

1318
01:29:03,923 --> 01:29:07,593
they were reserved more for merchant
and Royal Navy vessels

1319
01:29:07,718 --> 01:29:11,180
where you could have a crew of hundreds
and tons of cannons.

1320
01:29:11,305 --> 01:29:16,060
And tons of storage space for cargo
for shipping around the world.

1321
01:29:16,185 --> 01:29:21,983
The pirate ships were light fighters.
Guerilla fighters, if you will.

1322
01:29:22,108 --> 01:29:26,487
Find the ship, hit it,
take everything and run.

1323
01:29:26,612 --> 01:29:30,658
And so the smaller and faster
the pirate ship, the better.

1324
01:29:30,783 --> 01:29:34,120
Here the <i>Interceptor</i>
is a small, fast ship.

1325
01:29:34,245 --> 01:29:37,832
<i>Black Pearl</i> looks a little bigger.

1326
01:29:37,957 --> 01:29:40,585
And the <i>Dauntless</i> is the huge one.

1327
01:29:40,710 --> 01:29:44,380
That's the most powerful ship in
the fleet, but not the fastest,

1328
01:29:44,505 --> 01:29:47,633
though not the slowest.

1329
01:29:47,758 --> 01:29:52,930
What's good is that they really
identify different kinds of ships

1330
01:29:53,055 --> 01:29:56,767
and there's not one ship
that has everything you need.

1331
01:29:56,893 --> 01:30:00,813
Each ship has a strength
and a weakness.

1332
01:30:00,938 --> 01:30:04,525
The small, light ships
can be destroyed easily.

1333
01:30:04,650 --> 01:30:08,779
The trick is to run away
without getting destroyed first.

1334
01:30:08,905 --> 01:30:10,907
That was always the pirates' goals.

1335
01:30:11,032 --> 01:30:16,954
They would sail in brigs or in
little one or two-masted ships.

1336
01:30:17,079 --> 01:30:22,460
The people they preyed on were in huge
galleons, three, four, five masts,

1337
01:30:22,585 --> 01:30:25,713
and they could hit upon them
really quickly.

1338
01:30:42,188 --> 01:30:46,192
<i>Any of you so much
as thinks the word parley,</i>

1339
01:30:46,317 --> 01:30:49,028
<i>I'll have your guts for garters!</i>

1340
01:30:56,869 --> 01:31:00,373
[Stuart] You can't have a Bruckheimer
film without an explosion.

1341
01:31:00,498 --> 01:31:02,458
But, nicely, it works into the plot

1342
01:31:02,583 --> 01:31:07,213
and the feeling that
you've lost your hero.

1343
01:31:07,338 --> 01:31:11,384
In all good stories, too, there comes
a moment when you think the hero's dead.

1344
01:31:11,509 --> 01:31:16,639
That's part of good storytelling.

1345
01:31:16,764 --> 01:31:19,976
Even in "Star Wars", you think
Luke Skywalker has died.

1346
01:31:20,101 --> 01:31:22,979
He's taken by that creature
in the garbage compactor.

1347
01:31:23,104 --> 01:31:27,733
For a second you're wondering,
"Who am I going to identify with now?

1348
01:31:27,858 --> 01:31:29,902
He was the guy that I was rooting for."

1349
01:31:30,027 --> 01:31:34,073
And it gets you that involvement.

1350
01:31:34,198 --> 01:31:36,659
"What now? What's gonna happen now?"

1351
01:31:37,493 --> 01:31:38,744
<i>You can't...</i>

1352
01:31:38,869 --> 01:31:40,246
<i>I can.</i>

1353
01:31:41,956 --> 01:31:43,582
<i>Like that.</i>

1354
01:31:44,625 --> 01:31:45,918
<i>Who are you?</i>

1355
01:31:46,043 --> 01:31:47,461
<i>No one! He's no one!</i>

1356
01:31:48,212 --> 01:31:51,424
<i>A distant cousin of my aunt's
nephew, twice removed.</i>

1357
01:31:51,549 --> 01:31:53,759
<i>Lovely singing voice, though. Eunuch!</i>

1358
01:31:53,884 --> 01:31:55,469
<i>My name is Will Turner!</i>

1359
01:31:55,594 --> 01:31:58,264
<i>My father was Bootstrap Bill Turner.</i>

1360
01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:03,144
[Ted] This was really nice.
This all worked really well, I thought.

1361
01:32:03,269 --> 01:32:05,771
[Terry] We were concerned
about this scene,

1362
01:32:05,896 --> 01:32:09,108
it could skate real close

1363
01:32:09,233 --> 01:32:12,528
to parody or Monty Python.

1364
01:32:12,653 --> 01:32:16,949
The key was to have the pistol
under the chin and not up by the head.

1365
01:32:17,074 --> 01:32:22,455
[Ted] Yeah, you might hit that
<i>Blazing Saddles,</i> Mel Brooks moment.

1366
01:32:23,622 --> 01:32:26,250
Then again...

1367
01:32:26,375 --> 01:32:31,047
[Terry] Again, you have to be very
careful how you negotiate with Barbossa.

1368
01:32:34,091 --> 01:32:37,344
[Ted] And Jack knows,
"We're all screwed now."

1369
01:32:37,470 --> 01:32:39,472
Will's doing the best he can, though.

1370
01:32:39,597 --> 01:32:41,432
That was, you know...

1371
01:32:44,226 --> 01:32:47,938
...I look at particularly the work
that Orlando and Keira do.

1372
01:32:48,064 --> 01:32:51,942
And... you know, Jack and
Johnny and Geoffrey

1373
01:32:52,068 --> 01:32:55,279
have these big,
flashy roles, wonderful performances.

1374
01:32:55,404 --> 01:32:59,825
I compare it, in <i>48 Hours...</i>

1375
01:32:59,950 --> 01:33:04,330
...Eddie Murphy was just brilliant
in that movie, just electric.

1376
01:33:04,455 --> 01:33:06,165
He really got a lot of attention.

1377
01:33:06,290 --> 01:33:08,709
But Nick Nolte's performance
in that movie

1378
01:33:08,834 --> 01:33:12,213
is so important to anchor...

1379
01:33:12,338 --> 01:33:14,173
...Eddie Murphy.

1380
01:33:14,298 --> 01:33:19,178
It's the same here.
Without the reality of Keira...

1381
01:33:19,303 --> 01:33:23,849
Keira and Orlando give this movie
an emotional grounding.

1382
01:33:23,974 --> 01:33:27,978
This was the gratuitous strip
on the plank that we were talking about.

1383
01:33:29,271 --> 01:33:31,440
<i>It's still warm.</i>

1384
01:33:31,982 --> 01:33:34,401
[Ted] We just had to pause a moment.

1385
01:33:34,527 --> 01:33:38,239
[Terry] But necessary, so she
doesn't sink like she did before.

1386
01:33:38,364 --> 01:33:41,867
[Ted] She gets the dress back,
and she's...

1387
01:33:41,992 --> 01:33:44,578
...a little more vulnerable
in this state.

1388
01:33:44,703 --> 01:33:46,997
And then the classic iconography.

1389
01:33:47,123 --> 01:33:52,128
As far as I know, no real pirates
ever made anybody walk the plank.

1390
01:33:52,253 --> 01:33:55,172
But you can't do a pirate movie
and not have that.

1391
01:33:55,297 --> 01:33:58,884
[Terry] Your line was "We wanted
to not make a movie about pirates."

1392
01:33:59,009 --> 01:34:03,055
[Ted] We didn't wanna make a movie about
real pirates but make a pirate movie.

1393
01:34:03,180 --> 01:34:05,099
There's a difference.

1394
01:34:05,224 --> 01:34:07,893
At any rate the emotional reality

1395
01:34:08,018 --> 01:34:11,397
that Keira and Orlando
give to this story

1396
01:34:11,522 --> 01:34:13,816
is necessary to make

1397
01:34:13,941 --> 01:34:18,654
what these two are doing
as real as possible.

1398
01:34:20,072 --> 01:34:21,615
<i>Off you go!</i>

1399
01:34:22,616 --> 01:34:25,244
<i>Last time you left me
a pistol with one shot.</i>

1400
01:34:25,911 --> 01:34:28,539
[Ted] Seasickness was a real problem.

1401
01:34:28,664 --> 01:34:32,209
The first day they were
shooting out on the <i>Black Pearl,</i>

1402
01:34:32,334 --> 01:34:36,630
which, because of its height,
really swayed,

1403
01:34:36,755 --> 01:34:40,968
they issued everybody
with seasickness medication.

1404
01:34:41,093 --> 01:34:46,599
But they didn't read the label that
said, "Do not operate heavy machinery.

1405
01:34:46,724 --> 01:34:48,350
Will cause drowsiness."

1406
01:34:48,475 --> 01:34:51,854
So there are some moments here

1407
01:34:51,979 --> 01:34:57,610
where the fact that our actors
are awake is just astounding.

1408
01:34:57,735 --> 01:35:01,697
It was Zoe Saldana, who plays Anamaria,
who was hit the worst.

1409
01:35:01,822 --> 01:35:04,408
She was just...

1410
01:35:04,533 --> 01:35:08,245
But nobody was having a good time
out here the first couple of days.

1411
01:35:09,622 --> 01:35:13,334
<i>That's the second time I've had to watch
that man sail away with my ship.</i>

1412
01:35:14,877 --> 01:35:17,379
[Stuart] You've gotta have
a sandy beach.

1413
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:22,635
And you've gotta be stuck with
a beautiful girl. And with lots of rum.

1414
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:27,139
And they hit all these beats.
Very, very important.

1415
01:35:27,264 --> 01:35:31,769
In a movie as specific
in genre as this,

1416
01:35:31,894 --> 01:35:35,147
audiences expect certain things.

1417
01:35:35,272 --> 01:35:37,816
In the same way,
seeing a movie like <i>Gladiator,</i>

1418
01:35:37,942 --> 01:35:40,653
they're expecting to see
gory fights in an arena

1419
01:35:40,778 --> 01:35:44,782
and lions and Christians
and things like that.

1420
01:35:44,907 --> 01:35:48,994
In <i>Pirates,</i>
we've gotta hit all those beats

1421
01:35:49,119 --> 01:35:51,914
that we know the audience
is gonna expect and want.

1422
01:35:52,039 --> 01:35:57,336
Walking the plank.
The pirate with the parrot.

1423
01:35:57,461 --> 01:36:00,339
The drunken pirate town.

1424
01:36:00,464 --> 01:36:05,261
And then of course we've got all
the scenes and vignettes from the ride,

1425
01:36:05,386 --> 01:36:09,014
to get in as many as we can
without forcing them upon the story.

1426
01:36:13,352 --> 01:36:16,605
This is getting towards the end
of the second act.

1427
01:36:16,730 --> 01:36:20,567
The end of the second act should be
the low point for the heroes.

1428
01:36:20,693 --> 01:36:23,821
The moment when they seem
completely defeated.

1429
01:36:23,946 --> 01:36:27,700
Screenplays are divided into three acts,

1430
01:36:27,825 --> 01:36:31,870
which is really just fancy words
for beginning, middle and end.

1431
01:36:31,996 --> 01:36:35,582
The first act is setting up
the characters, getting the story going,

1432
01:36:35,708 --> 01:36:39,962
catalysts that inspired the story.

1433
01:36:40,087 --> 01:36:43,924
The second act tells the story and
the third act's about wrapping it up.

1434
01:36:44,049 --> 01:36:47,720
Imagine that in every first act

1435
01:36:47,845 --> 01:36:51,056
you're going to be raising a question.

1436
01:36:51,181 --> 01:36:54,643
In this sense it's,
will Jack and Will rescue Elizabeth?

1437
01:36:54,768 --> 01:36:59,440
Something very simple that's going
to drive the whole second act.

1438
01:36:59,565 --> 01:37:02,901
Then at the end of the second act,
you wanna answer no.

1439
01:37:03,027 --> 01:37:06,613
As you see, Will's taken away.
Though they've rescued Elizabeth.

1440
01:37:06,739 --> 01:37:11,327
But Will's gonna die
and they're stuck on an island.

1441
01:37:11,452 --> 01:37:15,831
And so you're able to bring
the audience down to a low

1442
01:37:15,956 --> 01:37:18,334
and then bring them back up
to a high again,

1443
01:37:18,459 --> 01:37:20,627
cause they're about to get rescued.

1444
01:37:20,753 --> 01:37:24,131
Again, that's storytelling technique.

1445
01:37:26,425 --> 01:37:28,927
Get them low, then bring them back up.

1446
01:37:29,053 --> 01:37:33,015
That's how you get that roller coaster.
It's a series of highs and lows.

1447
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:37,603
It keeps the audience involved.

1448
01:37:37,728 --> 01:37:39,980
A boring ride is a flat ride.

1449
01:37:40,105 --> 01:37:42,274
A fun ride is a ride
that goes up and down.

1450
01:37:42,399 --> 01:37:45,944
That's literally what you're doing
as a storyteller.

1451
01:37:46,070 --> 01:37:51,784
You wanna provide those highs and lows.
And this is the biggest low right here.

1452
01:37:55,662 --> 01:37:56,872
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

1453
01:37:59,666 --> 01:38:03,253
[Terry] The actors were

1454
01:38:03,379 --> 01:38:06,465
incredibly respectful of the dialogue.

1455
01:38:06,590 --> 01:38:09,301
It doesn't often happen
to such an extent

1456
01:38:09,426 --> 01:38:12,930
on a big-budget picture.

1457
01:38:13,055 --> 01:38:15,808
But there were cases where, um,

1458
01:38:15,933 --> 01:38:19,478
runners would be sent
to get either Ted or I

1459
01:38:19,603 --> 01:38:25,234
to come to a rehearsal or a scene
to change even a single word.

1460
01:38:25,359 --> 01:38:30,322
Which was a testament to the actors,
but also to the whole production.

1461
01:38:30,447 --> 01:38:33,826
[Ted] I was here on this island.
I'm ten feet off-screen.

1462
01:38:33,951 --> 01:38:38,330
This was shot on a beach because
we couldn't get it all on the island,

1463
01:38:38,455 --> 01:38:41,041
but we were there.

1464
01:38:41,166 --> 01:38:46,505
Most of what the actors say in this
movie is as we wrote it, which was nice.

1465
01:38:46,630 --> 01:38:51,051
It's almost the first time
we've gotten a chance to find out,

1466
01:38:51,176 --> 01:38:55,305
does the dialogue we write
work for actors?

1467
01:38:55,431 --> 01:38:59,601
At least for actors from the
Commonwealth and Johnny Depp, it did.

1468
01:38:59,726 --> 01:39:02,479
<i>Not good! Stop!</i>

1469
01:39:02,604 --> 01:39:03,730
<i>Not good!</i>

1470
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:08,527
[Stuart] This is one of the truer
conventions that we know of piracy.

1471
01:39:08,652 --> 01:39:11,780
Pirates being obsessed with rum.
They were.

1472
01:39:11,905 --> 01:39:17,578
And this is quite accurate to what
pirates really thought of rum.

1473
01:39:17,703 --> 01:39:20,497
They spent it all.
They spent it on wine and women.

1474
01:39:20,622 --> 01:39:24,626
And then when the purses dried up,
they'd go out again,

1475
01:39:24,751 --> 01:39:28,881
hit the next ship, bring all the money
in, spend it all and go out again.

1476
01:39:29,006 --> 01:39:30,799
That was the pirate life.

1477
01:39:30,924 --> 01:39:35,721
Very carefree, no rules,
and they were outlaws.

1478
01:39:35,846 --> 01:39:39,641
It's the mix of all those elements
that's made us romance them.

1479
01:39:39,766 --> 01:39:43,061
I think in all of us, there's
a little bit of us that wants to rebel

1480
01:39:43,187 --> 01:39:48,692
and live a life free on the sea, and do
as we please, and have a great time.

1481
01:39:48,817 --> 01:39:50,694
And that's what pirates did.

1482
01:39:50,819 --> 01:39:54,740
Of course, the conditions were
hellacious on ships in those days.

1483
01:39:54,865 --> 01:39:59,369
It wasn't a pleasant experience.
A lot of these crews were shanghaied,

1484
01:39:59,495 --> 01:40:02,539
kidnapped at the docks
and forced aboard.

1485
01:40:02,664 --> 01:40:06,460
Once you're aboard and you wake up
and you realize you can't swim home,

1486
01:40:06,585 --> 01:40:07,920
then you're stuck there.

1487
01:40:08,045 --> 01:40:13,258
And that's how they crewed a lot
of their crews in those days.

1488
01:40:15,260 --> 01:40:18,805
[Ted] I love how Johnny
plays this scene.

1489
01:40:18,931 --> 01:40:22,267
This is the only point

1490
01:40:22,392 --> 01:40:25,979
where we actually see
desperation from Jack Sparrow.

1491
01:40:26,104 --> 01:40:30,108
He's right to be desperate,
because he's not gonna budge Norrington.

1492
01:40:30,234 --> 01:40:34,446
It's actually Elizabeth
who's able to make that change,

1493
01:40:34,571 --> 01:40:40,035
to get Norrington to do what Jack wants,
oddly enough.

1494
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:43,247
There's only two things in this movie

1495
01:40:43,372 --> 01:40:47,960
that were in the script that were shot
that didn't make it that I wish were.

1496
01:40:48,085 --> 01:40:52,923
One of them is, there's about
a 50-second coda to this scene,

1497
01:40:53,048 --> 01:40:58,470
after Norrington decides to go, between
Jack Davenport and Keira Knightley.

1498
01:40:58,595 --> 01:41:04,142
It was a nice moment where he
acknowledges what the audience knows.

1499
01:41:04,268 --> 01:41:10,065
He asks her, "I realize you're agreeing
to marry me to go rescue Will."

1500
01:41:10,190 --> 01:41:13,110
And she acknowledges that,

1501
01:41:13,235 --> 01:41:17,155
but she says, "It's not a condition.
It's just a request.

1502
01:41:17,281 --> 01:41:21,827
If you said no, I would still marry you
because I think you're a fine man."

1503
01:41:21,952 --> 01:41:26,039
It's interesting,
disillusioned as she is with piracy,

1504
01:41:26,164 --> 01:41:31,503
she's now starting to accept
these societal constraints,

1505
01:41:31,628 --> 01:41:35,215
saying, "I will find a way
to be happy within them."

1506
01:41:36,133 --> 01:41:37,759
<i>Cotton says you missed a bit.</i>

1507
01:41:40,262 --> 01:41:45,851
[Stuart] This was added to get more
information out about Will's father.

1508
01:41:45,976 --> 01:41:49,438
It's a very delicate balance
you have to strike,

1509
01:41:49,563 --> 01:41:52,733
knowing how much information to give,
to an audience.

1510
01:41:52,858 --> 01:41:55,402
Exposition scenes
are generally boring,

1511
01:41:55,527 --> 01:41:57,779
people telling
you what you need to know.

1512
01:41:57,904 --> 01:42:03,702
So you try and avoid them. You don't
want people talking about the past.

1513
01:42:03,827 --> 01:42:07,664
You wanna either show the past or not
have it be important to the present.

1514
01:42:07,789 --> 01:42:13,253
In early test screenings people were
confused about who Bootstrap Bill was.

1515
01:42:13,378 --> 01:42:17,633
So this became necessary to explain.

1516
01:42:17,758 --> 01:42:21,553
Note that they interject it
with jokes to keep it fresh,

1517
01:42:21,678 --> 01:42:25,599
so it's not just one person saying,
"This is what you need to know."

1518
01:42:25,724 --> 01:42:29,353
It's threaded in comedy
or in tension or in something else.

1519
01:42:29,478 --> 01:42:34,566
It's hard to have two characters
talking about the past,

1520
01:42:34,691 --> 01:42:36,568
especially if they both share it.

1521
01:42:36,693 --> 01:42:40,447
Then you have to make
one character angry.

1522
01:42:40,572 --> 01:42:43,325
"Remember when you were penniless
and I saved you?"

1523
01:42:43,450 --> 01:42:46,244
It's the only way to do it.

1524
01:42:46,370 --> 01:42:50,290
In this case, this is all about
informing Will who his father was.

1525
01:42:50,415 --> 01:42:53,418
<i>That's what you'd call ironic.</i>

1526
01:42:57,589 --> 01:42:59,216
<i>Bring him!</i>

1527
01:43:06,431 --> 01:43:08,433
<i>I don't care for the situation.</i>

1528
01:43:08,975 --> 01:43:12,062
<i>Any attempt to storm the caves
could turn into an ambush.</i>

1529
01:43:12,187 --> 01:43:15,440
<i>Not if you're the one
doing the ambushing.</i>

1530
01:43:15,565 --> 01:43:19,194
<i>I go in and convince Barbossa to send
his men out in their little boats.</i>

1531
01:43:19,319 --> 01:43:22,114
<i>You and your men
return to the</i> Dauntless

1532
01:43:22,239 --> 01:43:26,118
<i>and blast the bejesus out of them
with your little cannons.</i>

1533
01:43:26,243 --> 01:43:28,745
[Ted] The other scene
that I actually miss,

1534
01:43:28,870 --> 01:43:31,331
I wish it had been in here,

1535
01:43:31,456 --> 01:43:34,292
It wasn't necessary
but it was a nice addition,

1536
01:43:34,418 --> 01:43:40,090
was the one between Jack and Elizabeth
just before this,

1537
01:43:40,215 --> 01:43:44,136
where they talk about
the fact that...

1538
01:43:44,261 --> 01:43:49,182
...where Jack says, "We're not so much
different, you and I.

1539
01:43:49,307 --> 01:43:50,642
Peas in a pod."

1540
01:43:50,767 --> 01:43:56,523
She's done something as ruthless
as Jack would have done.

1541
01:43:56,648 --> 01:43:59,818
Of course, Jack doesn't trust her
because of it.

1542
01:43:59,943 --> 01:44:02,487
He no longer trusts her at all
to do what he wants,

1543
01:44:02,612 --> 01:44:04,990
so he gets her locked away.

1544
01:44:08,034 --> 01:44:09,494
<i>No reason to fret.</i>

1545
01:44:09,619 --> 01:44:12,164
<i>A prick of the finger,
a few drops of blood...</i>

1546
01:44:12,289 --> 01:44:14,207
<i>No mistakes this time.</i>

1547
01:44:14,332 --> 01:44:16,001
<i>He's only half Turner.</i>

1548
01:44:16,126 --> 01:44:17,502
<i>We spill it all!</i>

1549
01:44:19,921 --> 01:44:21,757
<i>Guess there is reason to fret.</i>

1550
01:44:24,342 --> 01:44:29,306
[Ted] One of the things
that solidified for me

1551
01:44:29,431 --> 01:44:33,977
working on this movie,
and it went to the actors, the crew,

1552
01:44:34,102 --> 01:44:37,063
all the department heads,
is that everyone in Hollywood

1553
01:44:37,189 --> 01:44:42,694
pretty much what they want to do
is the best work they possibly can.

1554
01:44:42,819 --> 01:44:47,699
Most of the complaints
and frustrations in filmmaking

1555
01:44:47,824 --> 01:44:50,368
come from feeling artificial limitations

1556
01:44:50,494 --> 01:44:53,288
have been put on doing
the best work you can.

1557
01:44:53,413 --> 01:44:56,875
I remember when we were shooting
in the Caribbean

1558
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,711
the actors were at...

1559
01:44:59,836 --> 01:45:04,007
...at the most
luxurious resort in St. Vincent

1560
01:45:04,132 --> 01:45:06,510
which is not to say
it was a luxury resort,

1561
01:45:06,635 --> 01:45:08,720
but it was the most luxurious.

1562
01:45:08,845 --> 01:45:13,016
The only time they got
frustrated or annoyed

1563
01:45:13,141 --> 01:45:15,560
was when they couldn't shoot,

1564
01:45:15,685 --> 01:45:18,396
when they knew somewhere
acting was happening

1565
01:45:18,522 --> 01:45:20,273
and they couldn't be part of it.

1566
01:45:20,398 --> 01:45:24,611
It was actually kind of fun
to find that out.

1567
01:45:24,736 --> 01:45:28,865
[Terry] I was particularly impressed
with Johnny Depp,

1568
01:45:28,990 --> 01:45:34,788
who the only time I recall him
getting upset

1569
01:45:34,913 --> 01:45:37,249
was making sure that, uh,

1570
01:45:37,374 --> 01:45:42,003
proper safety precautions
were in place.

1571
01:45:42,128 --> 01:45:46,758
Especially regarding walking the plank
or being over the water.

1572
01:45:46,883 --> 01:45:49,761
Of course, Johnny hates water.

1573
01:45:49,886 --> 01:45:54,266
That may be part of it but he was
concerned for the other actors.

1574
01:45:54,391 --> 01:45:58,186
[Ted] Closed water he's OK with
but that open ocean water,

1575
01:45:58,311 --> 01:46:01,106
he's not too fond of.

1576
01:46:01,231 --> 01:46:05,277
A line I thought would be nice was,
"Do you think he was telling the truth?"

1577
01:46:05,402 --> 01:46:07,487
The line was supposed to be:

1578
01:46:07,612 --> 01:46:10,949
"He doesn't tell the truth
when he's telling the truth."

1579
01:46:11,074 --> 01:46:13,785
Maybe that was a bit over the top.

1580
01:46:13,910 --> 01:46:19,541
That does sum up
Jack's character pretty well.

1581
01:46:25,714 --> 01:46:29,092
This was the moment where
the rhythm thing I was talking about

1582
01:46:29,217 --> 01:46:31,428
initially was in the script.

1583
01:46:31,553 --> 01:46:35,807
He says, "Your men do
what they do best.

1584
01:46:35,932 --> 01:46:38,643
Chop, chop, chop, stab, stab, stab.

1585
01:46:38,768 --> 01:46:41,813
There you are with two ships."

1586
01:46:41,938 --> 01:46:45,108
Johnny didn't like the chop-stab,

1587
01:46:45,233 --> 01:46:48,111
again in terms of constraints.

1588
01:46:48,236 --> 01:46:52,699
I said, "All we need is something
fun to that hits that rhythm."

1589
01:46:52,824 --> 01:46:54,951
And that's when he came up with

1590
01:46:55,076 --> 01:46:59,956
"Robert's your uncle, Fanny's your
aunt," which has that same...

1591
01:47:00,081 --> 01:47:02,417
Chop-chop, stab-stab rhythm.

1592
01:47:02,542 --> 01:47:04,669
I just thought it was, uh...

1593
01:47:07,213 --> 01:47:11,051
Let them make up what they want
as long it fits what we want.

1594
01:47:11,176 --> 01:47:14,679
[Terry] In the mechanics of the curse,
here's a key moment.

1595
01:47:14,804 --> 01:47:17,641
Provided for you in slow-motion

1596
01:47:17,766 --> 01:47:20,936
and there's two shots,
and we let, uh,

1597
01:47:21,061 --> 01:47:23,855
the Will character to register it.

1598
01:47:23,980 --> 01:47:28,026
It's right there,
for those who might miss it,

1599
01:47:28,151 --> 01:47:29,986
mostly critics,

1600
01:47:30,111 --> 01:47:33,698
that Johnny has actually
stolen the coin for himself.

1601
01:47:33,823 --> 01:47:38,328
He's predicted that he may
be able to divide and conquer

1602
01:47:38,453 --> 01:47:42,457
Barbossa's forces, but he's anticipating
the battle to come.

1603
01:47:42,582 --> 01:47:44,542
And, if, you're about to...

1604
01:47:44,668 --> 01:47:48,630
If you're going to bring off
this whole strategy,

1605
01:47:48,755 --> 01:47:52,717
and try to defeat this guy
he figures a little insurance.

1606
01:47:52,842 --> 01:47:55,637
I might as well make myself immortal
just in case.

1607
01:47:55,762 --> 01:47:58,848
[Ted] That's also the moment
when Will realizes,

1608
01:47:58,974 --> 01:48:03,103
that from the beginning,
this has been Jack's plan,

1609
01:48:03,228 --> 01:48:06,523
to get Will close enough to the treasure
to lift the curse

1610
01:48:06,648 --> 01:48:10,568
at the moment that is
most profitable to Jack,

1611
01:48:10,694 --> 01:48:14,406
which in this instance would also be
most profitable to Will.

1612
01:48:14,531 --> 01:48:16,825
I also want to point out

1613
01:48:16,950 --> 01:48:21,788
that Jack's plan here was to keep
the British on <i>The Dauntless,</i>

1614
01:48:21,913 --> 01:48:24,624
and have all of the pirates
row out on rowboats

1615
01:48:24,749 --> 01:48:28,128
where <i>The Dauntless</i> can keep
firing cannonballs at them

1616
01:48:28,253 --> 01:48:30,422
until the curse is lifted.

1617
01:48:30,547 --> 01:48:33,717
He did not anticipate nor intend

1618
01:48:33,842 --> 01:48:36,136
to ambush them
as they came out of the cave.

1619
01:48:36,261 --> 01:48:40,098
He did not anticipate this.

1620
01:48:40,223 --> 01:48:43,727
This moment here is why you want
supernatural pirates.

1621
01:48:43,852 --> 01:48:49,774
That was our big contribution.

1622
01:48:49,899 --> 01:48:54,863
A couple of screenplays were developed
previous to our involvement...

1623
01:48:54,988 --> 01:48:58,950
...that had a Jack Sparrow character,
Will Turner, Elizabeth,

1624
01:48:59,075 --> 01:49:04,289
the basic setup, but it was
that absence of the supernatural.

1625
01:49:04,414 --> 01:49:08,126
What did Barbossa want?
At that point, Blackheart.

1626
01:49:08,251 --> 01:49:13,214
We just went back
to the writers and said,

1627
01:49:13,339 --> 01:49:17,886
"There are all these stories,
these elements of the supernatural,

1628
01:49:18,011 --> 01:49:21,264
that have never been used
in a pirate movie.

1629
01:49:21,389 --> 01:49:24,726
Let's go ahead
and make those elements overt."

1630
01:49:24,851 --> 01:49:27,270
[Terry] The ride begins
with a talking skull,

1631
01:49:27,395 --> 01:49:29,647
"You've seen the cursed treasure."

1632
01:49:29,773 --> 01:49:34,360
[Ted] "Not afraid of evil curses, says
ye? Properly warned, ye be, says I."

1633
01:49:34,486 --> 01:49:39,491
[Terry] The other thing,
taking the reality of the movie

1634
01:49:39,616 --> 01:49:43,244
into the realm of
the supernatural does,

1635
01:49:43,369 --> 01:49:45,955
is it actually allows the audience

1636
01:49:46,081 --> 01:49:49,084
to go along into a world
where they'll accept

1637
01:49:49,209 --> 01:49:51,377
a certain amount of stylization.

1638
01:49:51,503 --> 01:49:55,507
A supernatural story is a stylized
story, a different world.

1639
01:49:55,632 --> 01:50:00,345
I'm not sure audiences
would have accepted

1640
01:50:00,470 --> 01:50:02,597
things such as walking the plank,

1641
01:50:02,722 --> 01:50:05,350
talking parrots or the rest of it...

1642
01:50:05,475 --> 01:50:09,562
unless we had already
brought them in and said,

1643
01:50:09,687 --> 01:50:12,482
"This is a ghost story."
Once in the ghost story,

1644
01:50:12,607 --> 01:50:14,526
they can start to accept

1645
01:50:14,651 --> 01:50:18,613
some rather amazing or crazy things,

1646
01:50:18,738 --> 01:50:23,785
including the Johnny Depp performance
of Jack Sparrow.

1647
01:50:23,910 --> 01:50:28,414
[Ted] We didn't want to do
a movie about real pirates.

1648
01:50:28,540 --> 01:50:31,584
We didn't want
a naturalistic pirate movie.

1649
01:50:31,709 --> 01:50:36,548
We wanted to do a swashbuckler,
a romance.

1650
01:50:36,673 --> 01:50:39,300
A romance in the classical sense
of the term.

1651
01:50:39,425 --> 01:50:45,014
The horror genre descends
from romance through Gothic.

1652
01:50:45,140 --> 01:50:49,644
There are similarities,
a lot of overlapping conventions.

1653
01:50:49,769 --> 01:50:53,606
Bringing in the supernatural element,
like Terry says,

1654
01:50:53,731 --> 01:50:57,902
heightened the reality
and allowed us to do the romance.

1655
01:50:58,027 --> 01:51:02,907
The Anthony Hope quote,

1656
01:51:03,032 --> 01:51:06,661
"The romance genre gives to ambition
the boundless field,

1657
01:51:06,786 --> 01:51:09,747
to courage the high moment,
to love the ideal object."

1658
01:51:09,873 --> 01:51:14,919
That's what we wanted, those moments.
High adventure.

1659
01:51:18,548 --> 01:51:21,092
This was an amazing sequence
to watch shoot.

1660
01:51:21,217 --> 01:51:25,346
The way it was done,
first you had the pirates,

1661
01:51:25,471 --> 01:51:30,268
the stunt pirates and the acting
pirates, and the navy guys.

1662
01:51:30,393 --> 01:51:34,105
They had choreographed
this incredible melee.

1663
01:51:34,230 --> 01:51:36,733
Then all of the pirate guys went away.

1664
01:51:36,858 --> 01:51:40,236
And the navy guys did it themselves,
by themselves.

1665
01:51:40,361 --> 01:51:43,323
Jack Davenport described it
as learning to do a tango,

1666
01:51:43,448 --> 01:51:45,241
only you don't have a partner.

1667
01:51:45,366 --> 01:51:49,204
Then they brought back the pirates
and got rid of the navy guys.

1668
01:51:49,329 --> 01:51:52,165
It was an amazing thing to watch,

1669
01:51:52,290 --> 01:51:57,462
the coordination and the skill
of the stunt performers.

1670
01:51:59,130 --> 01:52:02,300
<i>But it turns out you're
a hard man to predict.</i>

1671
01:52:02,842 --> 01:52:06,221
[Stuart] Every good story leads
to an exciting climax.

1672
01:52:06,346 --> 01:52:08,306
Several things going on at once.

1673
01:52:08,431 --> 01:52:10,725
Several stories being wrapped up at once

1674
01:52:10,850 --> 01:52:15,897
in a way that's exciting and doesn't
require a lot of explanation.

1675
01:52:19,901 --> 01:52:22,820
[Ted] Of course, this is
Jack's plan in operation.

1676
01:52:22,946 --> 01:52:25,949
Separate, lower the numbers,

1677
01:52:26,074 --> 01:52:29,410
and he knows Will's skill
with the sword.

1678
01:52:29,535 --> 01:52:33,331
My theory has always been
that Will in this movie,

1679
01:52:33,456 --> 01:52:37,877
Will is the best swordsman.
Barbossa and Norrington are matched,

1680
01:52:38,002 --> 01:52:41,297
and Jack is the worst of the four.

1681
01:52:41,422 --> 01:52:44,842
He loses both of
the sword fights he's in.

1682
01:52:44,968 --> 01:52:48,471
He technically loses them both.

1683
01:52:48,596 --> 01:52:51,975
His idea was lower the numbers,
let Will do what he has to do,

1684
01:52:52,100 --> 01:52:54,227
at the opportune moment,
lift the curse.

1685
01:52:54,352 --> 01:52:58,690
He has finally got all the pieces
where he needs them.

1686
01:53:00,358 --> 01:53:01,693
<i>Right.</i>

1687
01:53:04,946 --> 01:53:08,700
[Stuart] One of the most satisfying
things about writing this

1688
01:53:08,825 --> 01:53:10,994
was being a part of the Disney legacy.

1689
01:53:11,119 --> 01:53:16,374
This is a ride that has
been around for 40 years now

1690
01:53:16,499 --> 01:53:21,504
and has thrilled people all over
the world for that length of time.

1691
01:53:21,629 --> 01:53:24,716
To be a part of the team

1692
01:53:24,841 --> 01:53:29,846
that brought it
to the screen is just fantastic.

1693
01:53:29,971 --> 01:53:33,016
Scary at the same time.
We hoped that this worked.

1694
01:53:33,141 --> 01:53:34,726
We were pretty sure it did.

1695
01:53:34,851 --> 01:53:38,062
I was always convinced
it could work if done right.

1696
01:53:38,187 --> 01:53:40,857
The real danger was whether
it was done right or not,

1697
01:53:40,982 --> 01:53:44,235
and, fortunately, it was.

1698
01:53:44,360 --> 01:53:49,115
So... it's been a real joy
and a real honor to be part of.

1699
01:53:58,833 --> 01:54:01,919
They do a great job of cutting
round the different ships,

1700
01:54:02,045 --> 01:54:06,382
keeping you aware
of which ship you're on.

1701
01:54:06,507 --> 01:54:10,178
That's a credit to the writing
and the editors.

1702
01:54:10,303 --> 01:54:14,349
You could easily get confused
about who's where,

1703
01:54:14,474 --> 01:54:17,602
and what's happening,
but I think it keeps very clear.

1704
01:54:20,438 --> 01:54:22,106
<i>Make for the ship! Move!</i>

1705
01:54:27,362 --> 01:54:31,199
[Stuart] Here is again, real violence.
You don't have to show the blood.

1706
01:54:31,324 --> 01:54:34,952
You just have to know
that it's happening.

1707
01:54:35,078 --> 01:54:38,456
That's the difference.
An "R" would have shown that.

1708
01:54:38,581 --> 01:54:41,167
We wanted to keep it under "R"
and keep it "PG-13."

1709
01:54:41,292 --> 01:54:44,212
That was always part of the design.

1710
01:54:56,182 --> 01:55:00,144
[Terry] The thing I'm amazed at,
having seen it shot,

1711
01:55:00,269 --> 01:55:03,606
that Gore and...

1712
01:55:03,731 --> 01:55:06,692
...Dariusz... right?

1713
01:55:06,818 --> 01:55:08,361
[Ted] The cinematographer.

1714
01:55:08,486 --> 01:55:11,656
[Ted] The use of camera movement...

1715
01:55:11,781 --> 01:55:16,285
...Gore was able to seemingly
predict on the set

1716
01:55:16,411 --> 01:55:20,373
and in terms of storyboarding,
exactly the times when...

1717
01:55:20,498 --> 01:55:22,250
[Ted] There's a shocking moment.

1718
01:55:22,375 --> 01:55:25,044
I don't think anybody
expected that to happen.

1719
01:55:28,214 --> 01:55:29,882
Or that.

1720
01:55:32,844 --> 01:55:37,974
Terry and I came up with the idea
of a supernatural pirate movie

1721
01:55:38,099 --> 01:55:42,019
ten years ago, or a little bit more.

1722
01:55:42,145 --> 01:55:46,649
We'd seen the Harryhausen movies
where the human fights the skeleton.

1723
01:55:46,774 --> 01:55:49,360
We wanted two skeletons fighting.

1724
01:55:49,485 --> 01:55:53,698
We finally got it.

1725
01:55:54,198 --> 01:55:55,992
<i>I couldn't resist, mate.</i>

1726
01:55:56,242 --> 01:55:58,161
[Stuart] There's an expression,

1727
01:55:58,286 --> 01:56:00,538
"squeezing the lemon"
out of your premise.

1728
01:56:00,663 --> 01:56:02,457
That's this here.

1729
01:56:02,582 --> 01:56:06,544
They're getting the most
out of this idea of undead pirates

1730
01:56:06,669 --> 01:56:09,005
being seen as undead in the moonlight.

1731
01:56:09,130 --> 01:56:14,677
The two leads jump in and out
of the moonlight as skeletons.

1732
01:56:14,802 --> 01:56:18,598
A lot of times
you see a movie and think,

1733
01:56:18,723 --> 01:56:22,727
they could have done more with that.
They didn't squeeze the lemon enough.

1734
01:56:22,852 --> 01:56:28,691
Squeeze that lemon dry and get the most
out of what you've set up.

1735
01:56:28,816 --> 01:56:32,778
Good stories will do that every time.
It's done here.

1736
01:56:40,369 --> 01:56:43,623
[Ted] The CGI here, the animation here,

1737
01:56:43,748 --> 01:56:46,834
the fact that the skeletons

1738
01:56:46,959 --> 01:56:50,171
maintain the performance
of the actors,

1739
01:56:50,296 --> 01:56:55,134
but they don't just do it
with our hero actors.

1740
01:56:55,259 --> 01:56:59,013
Every single one of those pirates
is individualized

1741
01:56:59,138 --> 01:57:01,557
and the movements are specific

1742
01:57:01,682 --> 01:57:06,312
and matched to the actor who was
playing the role in the first place.

1743
01:57:06,437 --> 01:57:09,190
It's really extraordinary.

1744
01:57:09,315 --> 01:57:11,943
No way could that have been done
ten years ago.

1745
01:57:12,735 --> 01:57:14,403
<i>So what now, Jack Sparrow?</i>

1746
01:57:14,529 --> 01:57:17,198
<i>Are we to be two immortals,
locked in an epic battle?</i>

1747
01:57:18,574 --> 01:57:24,288
[Stuart] This is the final proof
that Johnny is a bad-ass pirate,

1748
01:57:24,413 --> 01:57:29,001
ahead of everyone,
and that he is a real sword fighter

1749
01:57:29,126 --> 01:57:33,422
and that he can really hold his own
with the best of pirates.

1750
01:57:49,397 --> 01:57:50,606
<i>All of you with me!</i>

1751
01:57:50,898 --> 01:57:53,859
[Stuart] Here is a great example
of the writing.

1752
01:57:53,985 --> 01:57:58,990
This idea of the pirate code
being more like a guideline.

1753
01:57:59,115 --> 01:58:04,745
It starts with Captain Barbossa
to Keira.

1754
01:58:04,870 --> 01:58:10,710
Elizabeth then transfers it
to Gibbs and his pirates,

1755
01:58:10,835 --> 01:58:14,505
and then at the end,
Gibbs transfers it to Jack Sparrow.

1756
01:58:14,630 --> 01:58:18,175
So you get this nice
recurring line coming back

1757
01:58:18,301 --> 01:58:20,678
and you can see where it's come from.

1758
01:58:20,803 --> 01:58:23,222
Jack is saved by his crew
at the very end

1759
01:58:23,347 --> 01:58:28,561
because of something Captain Barbossa
said to Elizabeth two hours before.

1760
01:58:28,686 --> 01:58:31,272
That's fun. Very clever.

1761
01:58:35,443 --> 01:58:39,113
Here's another pirate convention,
a great battle at the end.

1762
01:58:39,238 --> 01:58:42,867
In my draft, this was when

1763
01:58:42,992 --> 01:58:45,328
the pirates came
to Port Royal in force

1764
01:58:45,453 --> 01:58:49,874
and tried to take the town.

1765
01:58:49,999 --> 01:58:54,754
Here, it's a battle out at sea
with the undead pirates.

1766
01:58:54,879 --> 01:58:57,214
This is one of the staples.

1767
01:58:57,340 --> 01:59:01,385
A big battle with guns and swords.
Close-quarters combat.

1768
01:59:19,654 --> 01:59:22,198
[Terry] One of my favorite moments
is coming up.

1769
01:59:22,323 --> 01:59:26,410
Murtogg and Mullroy
come up on the ship.

1770
01:59:26,535 --> 01:59:29,830
[Ted] They have to lift the curses.

1771
01:59:29,955 --> 01:59:32,375
This was pure Gore.

1772
01:59:32,500 --> 01:59:35,169
[Terry] You almost half-expect them
to back away.

1773
01:59:35,294 --> 01:59:38,923
Instead, they become
such legitimate characters

1774
01:59:39,048 --> 01:59:41,759
by the fact that
they step into the fray.

1775
01:59:41,884 --> 01:59:44,553
They are actually navy men, soldiers.

1776
01:59:44,679 --> 01:59:47,223
[Ted] Second hardest line
in the movie to write.

1777
01:59:47,348 --> 01:59:50,101
Gore wanted Elizabeth
to have that hero moment

1778
01:59:50,226 --> 01:59:52,853
when she appears
and to have the hero line.

1779
01:59:55,815 --> 01:59:57,191
<i>Try wearing a corset.</i>

1780
01:59:57,316 --> 01:59:59,985
[Ted] We referred to it
as the cheesy hero line.

1781
02:00:00,111 --> 02:00:04,115
We wanted that line.
It had to be a cheesy hero line.

1782
02:00:04,240 --> 02:00:09,078
But it had to be good and have
something to do with the story.

1783
02:00:09,203 --> 02:00:11,497
Second hardest line
of the movie to write.

1784
02:00:14,166 --> 02:00:17,962
[Stuart] Pirates favored short swords
for close-quarters combat.

1785
02:00:18,087 --> 02:00:24,009
They didn't want big broadswords
like in <i>Braveheart.</i>

1786
02:00:24,135 --> 02:00:26,470
They weren't trying
to cut through armor.

1787
02:00:26,595 --> 02:00:28,973
They wanted light, short rip swords

1788
02:00:29,098 --> 02:00:34,729
that they could stick in their pants
and pull out.

1789
02:00:34,854 --> 02:00:39,859
This is where the cutlass came from.
The short, curved sword.

1790
02:00:39,984 --> 02:00:43,154
It's a devastating weapon
in close-quarters combat.

1791
02:00:48,826 --> 02:00:53,831
I want to point out,
everybody who took a coin is cursed.

1792
02:00:53,956 --> 02:00:56,834
To lift the curse,
all the coins have to go back in,

1793
02:00:56,959 --> 02:01:00,504
with the blood of those who took them.
Jack just slit his palm

1794
02:01:00,629 --> 02:01:03,758
in order to get blood on the coin
he took, threw it to Will,

1795
02:01:03,883 --> 02:01:09,555
Will now has both, his coin
and Jack's coin with blood on it,

1796
02:01:09,680 --> 02:01:15,269
and now Will has put blood
on the coin he had.

1797
02:01:15,394 --> 02:01:18,189
[Terry] This is the opportune moment.

1798
02:01:18,314 --> 02:01:21,358
[Ted] There's all the blood,
all the coins,

1799
02:01:21,484 --> 02:01:25,529
the curse has gone and here's the proof.

1800
02:01:25,654 --> 02:01:28,699
The bullet that's still
lodged in his heart...

1801
02:01:28,824 --> 02:01:32,453
...kills Barbossa.

1802
02:01:32,578 --> 02:01:36,123
It all makes perfect sense, Terry.
Well done, well done, sir!

1803
02:01:36,248 --> 02:01:40,419
[Terry] This is what you,
of course, call your irony.

1804
02:01:40,544 --> 02:01:43,214
He finally feels,
only to feel his own death.

1805
02:01:43,339 --> 02:01:47,259
[Ted] A lot of this, I have to admit,
was influenced by EC Comics.

1806
02:01:47,384 --> 02:01:50,012
The horror comics,
<i>Tales From The Crypt.</i>

1807
02:01:50,137 --> 02:01:54,934
Not the series of films from the comics,
the comics themselves,

1808
02:01:55,059 --> 02:01:57,311
where so much of that,

1809
02:01:57,436 --> 02:02:00,731
the horror was based
on the irony of just desert,

1810
02:02:00,856 --> 02:02:05,820
of the "you wished for this,
you're going to get it tenfold."

1811
02:02:05,945 --> 02:02:08,572
You're greedy?
Fine, be greedy for ever.

1812
02:02:08,697 --> 02:02:12,284
You'll always starve,
be thirsty, be horny.

1813
02:02:12,409 --> 02:02:14,119
That's what greed is.

1814
02:02:14,245 --> 02:02:16,288
The pirate's curse...

1815
02:02:16,413 --> 02:02:19,291
...compelled by greed,
consumed by greed.

1816
02:02:24,421 --> 02:02:28,884
[Terry] Bruce Hendricks,
the head of production at Disney,

1817
02:02:29,009 --> 02:02:32,888
[Ted] Line producer, second director...
a lot of jobs.

1818
02:02:33,013 --> 02:02:34,640
[Terry] He was happy to find out

1819
02:02:34,765 --> 02:02:37,935
that we weren't
going to actually show the hand,

1820
02:02:38,060 --> 02:02:42,773
that it didn't have to be created.
Cost savings on a $160 million movie.

1821
02:02:42,898 --> 02:02:45,651
[Ted] Also more effective
to have it off screen.

1822
02:02:45,776 --> 02:02:47,653
Here's the meeting of...

1823
02:02:47,778 --> 02:02:51,866
...basically our Abbott
and Costello on acid

1824
02:02:51,991 --> 02:02:53,951
and Laurel and Hardy.

1825
02:02:55,494 --> 02:02:59,206
[Terry] Finally, the pairs meet.

1826
02:02:59,331 --> 02:03:03,127
[Ted] This moment,
you could have cut sooner.

1827
02:03:03,252 --> 02:03:07,006
Let's just watch
Jonathan Pryce act here.

1828
02:03:09,508 --> 02:03:13,345
- [Ted laughs]
- [Terry] There aren't really...

1829
02:03:13,470 --> 02:03:17,725
...multiple endings on the movie.

1830
02:03:17,850 --> 02:03:22,646
Pretty much until the resolution
of the love story,

1831
02:03:22,771 --> 02:03:28,277
and whether Jack gets his ship back,
the villain has been defeated,

1832
02:03:28,402 --> 02:03:32,656
but there are these other stories
that have to be tied up.

1833
02:03:32,781 --> 02:03:35,159
[Ted] Here's my theory.

1834
02:03:35,284 --> 02:03:38,495
We didn't bother with that

1835
02:03:38,621 --> 02:03:42,833
three-act action-movie paradigm.

1836
02:03:42,958 --> 02:03:47,463
We didn't fit the story to work to it.

1837
02:03:47,588 --> 02:03:51,300
Typically, defeating the villain
would end everything.

1838
02:03:51,425 --> 02:03:54,094
That's your final movement.

1839
02:03:54,219 --> 02:03:57,056
We also didn't have the villain
have some sort of plot

1840
02:03:57,181 --> 02:03:59,683
that was a threat
to the rest of the world.

1841
02:03:59,808 --> 02:04:02,061
Everything stayed on a personal level.

1842
02:04:02,186 --> 02:04:03,771
You made the joke,

1843
02:04:03,896 --> 02:04:08,567
we get to make
a $130 million character movie.

1844
02:04:08,692 --> 02:04:12,488
But it's all driven by the character
decision and design.

1845
02:04:12,613 --> 02:04:16,575
The story is not over until
the character stories are over.

1846
02:04:16,700 --> 02:04:20,412
[Terry] It was fun to not worry about
convention and break convention.

1847
02:04:20,537 --> 02:04:24,541
[Ted] Conventional
action-movie storytelling.

1848
02:04:24,667 --> 02:04:29,129
We were very aware of romance
and pirate-movie conventions.

1849
02:04:37,137 --> 02:04:41,558
[Stuart] Jack Sparrow spent the film
getting out of tricky situations.

1850
02:04:41,684 --> 02:04:43,894
By this time,
you know he's got to get out.

1851
02:04:44,019 --> 02:04:46,271
But, the great thing is,
you don't know how.

1852
02:04:46,397 --> 02:04:47,690
<i>Jack Sparrow!</i>

1853
02:04:47,815 --> 02:04:51,819
<i>- We have learned that you...
- Captain! Captain Jack Sparrow.</i>

1854
02:04:52,569 --> 02:04:55,489
[Stuart] Still insists
being called captain,

1855
02:04:55,614 --> 02:04:57,741
all he wants is the respect.

1856
02:04:57,866 --> 02:05:02,204
He just wants respect
and he's about to be hanged.

1857
02:05:02,329 --> 02:05:04,873
Please call me by my title.

1858
02:05:07,084 --> 02:05:08,919
Pirates were hanged.

1859
02:05:09,044 --> 02:05:12,506
They started to crack down on piracy
in the early 1700s.

1860
02:05:12,631 --> 02:05:16,760
They hanged them publicly.
Captain Kidd was hanged in 1701.

1861
02:05:16,885 --> 02:05:20,889
The rope broke the first time.
They had to hang him a second time.

1862
02:05:21,015 --> 02:05:23,767
Another pirate was hung.
He stopped twitching.

1863
02:05:23,892 --> 02:05:27,730
They brought him in to be embalmed
and he woke up, alive.

1864
02:05:27,855 --> 02:05:33,318
They had to let him go.
They'd already carried out the sentence.

1865
02:05:33,444 --> 02:05:36,864
Unfortunately, he had lived
so he got to go free again.

1866
02:05:38,824 --> 02:05:40,492
<i>[man] And for these crimes,</i>

1867
02:05:40,617 --> 02:05:43,120
<i>you have been sentenced to be,
on this day,</i>

1868
02:05:43,245 --> 02:05:46,915
<i>hung by the neck, until dead.</i>

1869
02:05:47,041 --> 02:05:49,251
<i>May God have mercy on your soul.</i>

1870
02:05:49,376 --> 02:05:50,836
<i>[Will] Governor Swann.</i>

1871
02:05:50,961 --> 02:05:52,838
<i>Commodore.</i>

1872
02:05:54,339 --> 02:05:58,177
[Ted] Elizabeth had become so
disillusioned with the idea of pirates.

1873
02:05:58,302 --> 02:06:01,013
Here Will is stepping up and becoming

1874
02:06:01,138 --> 02:06:05,142
the romantic pirate hero

1875
02:06:05,267 --> 02:06:10,022
that she dreamed of meeting
when she was 12 years old.

1876
02:06:10,147 --> 02:06:15,402
It's the guy who breaks the law
for what he believes is right,

1877
02:06:15,527 --> 02:06:18,030
not for his own gain
but for other people.

1878
02:06:18,155 --> 02:06:22,993
You go back and look at <i>Captain Blood,
The Sea Hawk</i> or <i>Crimson Pirate.</i>

1879
02:06:23,118 --> 02:06:26,705
Those guys may start off as pirates
but they end up as rebels.

1880
02:06:26,830 --> 02:06:29,958
They end up as people who are outlaws
with a cause.

1881
02:06:30,084 --> 02:06:33,003
That's the romantic image
and that's what Will becomes.

1882
02:06:33,128 --> 02:06:36,048
He's the first and only pirate
in the movie

1883
02:06:36,173 --> 02:06:40,260
who is actually a pirate-movie pirate.

1884
02:06:45,933 --> 02:06:50,562
[Stuart] The thing I try
to stick to for the third act

1885
02:06:50,687 --> 02:06:53,524
is a hero who does something
they never would've,

1886
02:06:53,649 --> 02:06:56,527
it's logical because of
what they've done in between.

1887
02:06:56,652 --> 02:07:00,197
In the simplest terms,
that's what you look for.

1888
02:07:00,322 --> 02:07:04,034
That gives you
a character-driven third act.

1889
02:07:04,159 --> 02:07:08,497
That gives meaning to your second act
and the growth there.

1890
02:07:08,622 --> 02:07:13,794
If your character does something
they wouldn't do at the beginning.

1891
02:07:13,919 --> 02:07:17,089
He would never rescue a pirate
that was about to be hanged.

1892
02:07:17,214 --> 02:07:19,133
He'd have enjoyed
watching him hang.

1893
02:07:19,258 --> 02:07:23,220
He is risking his life,
and condemning his life,

1894
02:07:23,345 --> 02:07:26,515
to save this pirate because he's learned

1895
02:07:26,640 --> 02:07:30,853
that you can be a pirate
and be a good man at the same time.

1896
02:07:30,978 --> 02:07:35,232
This is the first time Jack and Will
are working as a team,

1897
02:07:35,357 --> 02:07:38,193
together in tandem.

1898
02:07:38,318 --> 02:07:41,738
That's deliberate.
That's thought out.

1899
02:07:41,864 --> 02:07:47,244
By this stage, we want them reading
each other's thoughts.

1900
02:07:48,537 --> 02:07:50,122
<i>But not from you.</i>

1901
02:07:50,247 --> 02:07:54,042
<i>On our return to Port Royal,
I granted you clemency.</i>

1902
02:07:54,168 --> 02:07:55,752
<i>And this is how you thank me?</i>

1903
02:07:55,878 --> 02:07:57,880
<i>By throwing in your lot with him?</i>

1904
02:07:58,005 --> 02:07:59,506
<i>He's a pirate!</i>

1905
02:07:59,631 --> 02:08:01,550
<i>And a good man.</i>

1906
02:08:02,342 --> 02:08:04,595
<i>If all I've achieved
is that the hangman</i>

1907
02:08:04,720 --> 02:08:08,473
<i>will own two pairs
of boots instead of one, so be it.</i>

1908
02:08:09,141 --> 02:08:11,602
[Stuart] This was the lesson.

1909
02:08:11,727 --> 02:08:13,478
I know it was a lesson in my draft,

1910
02:08:13,604 --> 02:08:18,609
learning that not all pirates are bad.

1911
02:08:18,734 --> 02:08:20,944
Of course they were, back in the day.

1912
02:08:21,069 --> 02:08:24,364
But in our romanticized version,
they're not.

1913
02:08:24,489 --> 02:08:28,452
There can be good pirates.
That's what Will's come to learn.

1914
02:08:28,577 --> 02:08:33,248
He's now imparting the wisdom
to Norrington and the Governor.

1915
02:08:33,373 --> 02:08:36,960
Norrington represents the guy
who thinks all pirates are bad.

1916
02:08:37,085 --> 02:08:39,129
They're criminals, hang 'em.

1917
02:08:52,976 --> 02:08:58,148
[Ted] If you're going to break the law,
break it because the law is wrong.

1918
02:08:58,273 --> 02:09:02,486
Not because you want somebody's TV.

1919
02:09:02,611 --> 02:09:05,864
There is your moral message.
It is a Disney movie.

1920
02:09:05,989 --> 02:09:10,535
There is a happy Aesop's fable
moral to it.

1921
02:09:10,661 --> 02:09:12,996
I love her reaction to that idea.

1922
02:09:13,121 --> 02:09:16,291
Doesn't it also raise the question,

1923
02:09:16,416 --> 02:09:19,086
exactly how far was she willing to go

1924
02:09:19,211 --> 02:09:21,672
and how far did she go on that island?

1925
02:09:21,797 --> 02:09:26,093
There is a bit of "Shut up, Jack."

1926
02:09:28,303 --> 02:09:32,266
The nice hat was something that Orlando
got a couple of comments on.

1927
02:09:32,391 --> 02:09:36,144
When he was walking around
in the costume

1928
02:09:36,270 --> 02:09:39,648
The perfect thing for Jack to say
as his farewell line.

1929
02:09:43,986 --> 02:09:46,697
<i>Idiot! He's nowhere to go
but back to the noose!</i>

1930
02:09:48,740 --> 02:09:52,536
[Terry] It's a difficult rescue.
You count on different things.

1931
02:09:52,661 --> 02:09:55,163
You have to make it to the edge,

1932
02:09:55,289 --> 02:09:58,166
you have to survive
the fall into the rocks.

1933
02:09:58,292 --> 02:10:03,005
You've got to get your ship to come back
at the right moment.

1934
02:10:03,130 --> 02:10:06,800
[Ted] This is the moment I was talking
about, aboard the <i>Dauntless,</i>

1935
02:10:06,925 --> 02:10:10,846
when he acknowledged, was she doing it
because she loved him

1936
02:10:10,971 --> 02:10:14,474
or was she agreeing to marry him
out of love for Will?

1937
02:10:14,599 --> 02:10:19,396
That moment, I think, would have
set this up even stronger.

1938
02:10:19,521 --> 02:10:24,026
Without that,
Jack Davenport's performance

1939
02:10:24,151 --> 02:10:26,903
is what carries the believability
and the emotion

1940
02:10:27,029 --> 02:10:31,241
of what happens in this next bit.

1941
02:10:31,366 --> 02:10:35,871
You accept Norrington
having made this small change.

1942
02:10:35,996 --> 02:10:41,209
Also, you understand
he loves Elizabeth so much

1943
02:10:41,335 --> 02:10:44,338
he actually puts her happiness
ahead of his.

1944
02:10:44,463 --> 02:10:50,093
Had Norrington been a pirate,
he would be a pirate-movie pirate.

1945
02:10:52,095 --> 02:10:55,974
[Terry] Even though he changes,
he doesn't change that much.

1946
02:10:56,099 --> 02:10:58,101
He only gives them
a day's headstart.

1947
02:10:58,226 --> 02:11:01,313
- He will still be after them.
- [ted] He's Norrington.

1948
02:11:01,438 --> 02:11:03,357
He's still a feared pirate hunter.

1949
02:11:03,482 --> 02:11:08,111
"One day's headstart,
then we go after them."

1950
02:11:08,236 --> 02:11:10,947
There's also just
the sport of it, as well.

1951
02:11:11,073 --> 02:11:13,617
Actually, Jack does say

1952
02:11:13,742 --> 02:11:17,454
the <i>Black Pearl</i> was the last
pirate ship in the Caribbean.

1953
02:11:17,579 --> 02:11:22,167
Norrington is taking care of that. The
last opponent he has is Jack Sparrow.

1954
02:11:22,292 --> 02:11:25,962
Room for a sequel? Maybe.

1955
02:11:26,088 --> 02:11:28,048
And there's the hat hair.

1956
02:11:35,639 --> 02:11:38,934
[Stuart] That's what we waited for
the whole movie.

1957
02:11:39,059 --> 02:11:41,561
They deliver it right at the end.

1958
02:11:41,686 --> 02:11:47,234
That's rule number four.
Don't forget that.

1959
02:11:47,359 --> 02:11:52,614
Then you've got to end on Jack.
He's really the star of the movie.

1960
02:11:52,739 --> 02:11:56,326
You want to end a film
like this on a laugh.

1961
02:11:56,451 --> 02:11:58,787
Again, we're talking about
James Cameron.

1962
02:11:58,912 --> 02:12:01,498
The last thing you remember
as you walk out.

1963
02:12:01,623 --> 02:12:06,211
You've had a wonderful climax
of pirates and skeletons fighting.

1964
02:12:06,336 --> 02:12:08,255
You want to end on a laugh.

1965
02:12:13,218 --> 02:12:18,265
[Terry] We were on set
for the filming of this scene.

1966
02:12:18,390 --> 02:12:22,352
As it turns out, Johnny Depp
wrote what I believe is...

1967
02:12:22,477 --> 02:12:25,272
- [Ted] My favorite line.
- [Terry] Mine as well.

1968
02:12:25,397 --> 02:12:27,315
It's the last line.

1969
02:12:27,441 --> 02:12:31,820
What was great was because of the stunt
of him coming onto the ship,

1970
02:12:31,945 --> 02:12:36,741
it caused this line
to have to be written that day.

1971
02:12:36,867 --> 02:12:39,995
It was written in the morning,
so, "Bring me that horizon,"

1972
02:12:40,120 --> 02:12:43,039
was not in the movie, uh,

1973
02:12:43,165 --> 02:12:46,376
as of 6:00 AM the day it was shot.

1974
02:12:46,501 --> 02:12:48,920
[Ted] This was always
intended to be the end.

1975
02:12:49,045 --> 02:12:50,839
[Terry] Exactly.

1976
02:12:50,964 --> 02:12:52,424
It's a good job, Johnny.

1977
02:12:52,549 --> 02:12:54,342
<i>Bring me that horizon.</i>

1978
02:13:01,641 --> 02:13:04,102
<i>And really bad eggs.</i>

1979
02:13:04,227 --> 02:13:06,813
[Terry] There it is,
<i>Pirates of the Caribbean.</i>

1980
02:13:06,938 --> 02:13:08,773
[Ted] <i>The Curse of the Black Pearl.</i>

1981
02:13:08,899 --> 02:13:12,152
- This is Terry Rossio.
- And Ted Elliott.

1982
02:13:12,277 --> 02:13:17,824
My name is Jay Wolpert.
I'm one of the writers.

1983
02:13:17,949 --> 02:13:23,079
The only other thing to say is if
you're getting ready to set out to sea,

1984
02:13:23,205 --> 02:13:26,541
destroy all your rope,
pirates swing on that stuff.

1985
02:13:26,666 --> 02:13:30,295
I'm Stuart Beattie,
I was second writer on <i>Pirates.</i>

1986
02:13:30,420 --> 02:13:33,590
Thanks for watching the DVD.
Hope you enjoyed it.

1987
02:13:33,715 --> 02:13:37,969
Just a quick word about the credits
so you understand.

1988
02:13:38,094 --> 02:13:41,640
Screenplay and screen story.

1989
02:13:41,765 --> 02:13:45,352
All the scripts at the end are given to
the Writers' Guild of America.

1990
02:13:45,477 --> 02:13:49,439
They get three working writers
to read all the scripts

1991
02:13:49,564 --> 02:13:52,734
and to decide whose script
looks most like the finished film.

1992
02:13:52,859 --> 02:13:56,655
They decide the credit based on that.

1993
02:13:56,780 --> 02:14:00,825
When certain writers
have contributed enough to the film

1994
02:14:00,951 --> 02:14:03,495
where they've influenced story elements,

1995
02:14:03,620 --> 02:14:07,332
they will get story credit,
what Jay and I both got.

1996
02:14:07,457 --> 02:14:10,168
We had influenced
how the story took shape.

1997
02:14:10,293 --> 02:14:14,839
But, it was really Ted and Terry
who were on the set every day.

1998
02:14:14,965 --> 02:14:20,470
Of course, the whole curse element
was all by them.

1999
02:14:20,595 --> 02:14:22,556
So that's how it breaks down,

2000
02:14:22,681 --> 02:14:24,975
but we were all part of the big process.

2001
02:14:25,100 --> 02:14:27,811
I think we had the same goal,

2002
02:14:27,936 --> 02:14:30,647
which is why it worked
into one cohesive script,

2003
02:14:30,772 --> 02:14:33,525
not a butchered script
with three different voices,

2004
02:14:33,650 --> 02:14:36,403
which then translates into a fun film.

2005
02:14:36,528 --> 02:14:38,697
Thanks for watching.

2006
02:14:38,822 --> 02:14:43,994
[Ted] For everybody who stuck
all the way through to the end,

2007
02:14:44,119 --> 02:14:48,832
I'm going to give you the timeline
so that you alone can know

2008
02:14:48,957 --> 02:14:51,710
how the events of the story play out.

2009
02:14:51,835 --> 02:14:56,339
Or what actually happens
before the story begins.

2010
02:14:56,464 --> 02:15:01,469
Ten years earlier,
Jack showed up in Tortuga.

2011
02:15:01,595 --> 02:15:05,807
He was the captain of the <i>Black Pearl,</i>
going after the treasure.

2012
02:15:05,932 --> 02:15:07,642
And he had the compass.

2013
02:15:07,767 --> 02:15:12,856
Remember, Gibbs says
he gave up the bearings

2014
02:15:12,981 --> 02:15:14,649
which meant he knew where it was

2015
02:15:14,774 --> 02:15:19,195
and he had to have
already had the compass.

2016
02:15:19,321 --> 02:15:21,698
He also knew about the curse

2017
02:15:21,823 --> 02:15:26,161
and was the person who told Barbossa
and the crew about the curse.

2018
02:15:26,286 --> 02:15:28,997
That's the point
where in the jail cell,

2019
02:15:29,122 --> 02:15:32,667
he says there is a curse,
he knew about it, he didn't believe it.

2020
02:15:32,792 --> 02:15:36,921
Barbossa tells Elizabeth
when we first were told the tale.

2021
02:15:37,047 --> 02:15:39,049
By who? By Jack.

2022
02:15:39,174 --> 02:15:43,928
We thought it was just a ghost story
too, and we didn't believe it.

2023
02:15:44,054 --> 02:15:49,142
Bootstrap Bill was already
a member of Jack's crew...

2024
02:15:49,267 --> 02:15:53,146
...before he recruited the people
at Tortuga.

2025
02:15:53,271 --> 02:15:59,027
That's established when he talks about
how he knew Bill as William Turner.

2026
02:15:59,152 --> 02:16:01,363
He had a different relationship

2027
02:16:01,488 --> 02:16:05,283
with Bill Turner than Barbossa.

2028
02:16:05,408 --> 02:16:09,287
He gets the crew in Tortuga,
Barbossa and his cronies,

2029
02:16:09,412 --> 02:16:13,458
and more than likely Pintel and Ragetti.

2030
02:16:13,583 --> 02:16:15,752
They go sailing out.

2031
02:16:15,877 --> 02:16:19,005
First day out, Barbossa says,

2032
02:16:19,130 --> 02:16:23,927
"If we're all to going to have a share,
we should all know where we're going."

2033
02:16:24,052 --> 02:16:26,388
That's where Jack made his mistake.

2034
02:16:26,513 --> 02:16:29,057
He told him where Isla De La Muerte was,

2035
02:16:29,182 --> 02:16:32,310
making Barbossa somebody
who could find it

2036
02:16:32,435 --> 02:16:34,562
because he already knew where it was.

2037
02:16:34,688 --> 02:16:38,441
Jack's thrown overboard
with the compass and is marooned.

2038
02:16:38,566 --> 02:16:43,488
Bootstrap Bill, while he probably
didn't participate in the mutiny,

2039
02:16:43,613 --> 02:16:47,617
he stayed on board and the reason
Jack is OK with that,

2040
02:16:47,742 --> 02:16:51,454
he says at the end of the movie.
He did what's right by him.

2041
02:16:51,579 --> 02:16:54,958
That's the most you can expect.
He stuck by the code.

2042
02:16:55,083 --> 02:17:00,797
Pintel says "Bootstrap Bill
was a man of the code."

2043
02:17:00,922 --> 02:17:04,968
He showed up, he had the compass,
he recruited the crew.

2044
02:17:05,093 --> 02:17:07,303
Bootstrap Bill, already
a crew member.

2045
02:17:07,429 --> 02:17:11,266
He gave up the bearings to Barbossa
who led the mutiny.

2046
02:17:11,391 --> 02:17:13,893
That's why Jack hates him.

2047
02:17:14,018 --> 02:17:17,355
He violated the code.
Just pointing that out.

2048
02:17:17,480 --> 02:17:21,526
He got thrown overboard,
Bootstrap Bill stays with the crew.

2049
02:17:21,651 --> 02:17:25,238
They find the treasure,
they know about the curse.

2050
02:17:25,363 --> 02:17:28,366
They take the treasure.
Each of them, even the monkey,

2051
02:17:28,491 --> 02:17:31,911
takes a bit of the gold,
at that point had no name.

2052
02:17:32,036 --> 02:17:35,832
Then as they go out partying, carousing,

2053
02:17:35,957 --> 02:17:39,169
they discovered that they were cursed.

2054
02:17:39,294 --> 02:17:43,548
While it's not
specifically stated in the movie

2055
02:17:43,673 --> 02:17:46,509
how they learned to undo the curse,

2056
02:17:46,634 --> 02:17:49,888
there is a lot of Aztec writing
on that chest.

2057
02:17:50,013 --> 02:17:52,140
My guess is that they went back,

2058
02:17:52,265 --> 02:17:56,102
they learned that they needed
to put all the gold back.

2059
02:17:56,227 --> 02:17:59,147
Bootstrap Bill had been feeling guilty

2060
02:17:59,272 --> 02:18:01,983
because of what they did to Jack.

2061
02:18:02,108 --> 02:18:03,985
It was in violation of the code.

2062
02:18:04,110 --> 02:18:08,948
He said, "We deserve to be cursed
for what we did and to remain cursed."

2063
02:18:09,073 --> 02:18:14,621
That's when he sent one piece
of the gold to Will in England,

2064
02:18:14,746 --> 02:18:17,999
he never wanted the pirates
to be able to lift the curse.

2065
02:18:18,124 --> 02:18:21,711
Barbossa got pissed off,
strapped him to a cannon,

2066
02:18:21,836 --> 02:18:26,633
and dropped him into "the crushing
depths of Davy Jones' Locker,"

2067
02:18:26,758 --> 02:18:30,720
implying that while
Bill cursed is still alive,

2068
02:18:30,845 --> 02:18:33,306
he may be a very thin puddle

2069
02:18:33,431 --> 02:18:36,851
on the ocean's bottom.

2070
02:18:36,976 --> 02:18:38,937
That's what happens to Bill.

2071
02:18:39,062 --> 02:18:42,398
The pirates are cursed,
looking for every piece of gold.

2072
02:18:42,524 --> 02:18:45,902
They find out
what they haven't found out.

2073
02:18:46,027 --> 02:18:49,239
All the blood had to be returned.
Now there's two things to do.

2074
02:18:49,364 --> 02:18:53,827
Get all the gold back
and add their blood to the chest.

2075
02:18:53,952 --> 02:18:55,578
Eight years earlier,

2076
02:18:55,703 --> 02:18:59,332
that happens between the time
that Jack showed up to Tortuga

2077
02:18:59,457 --> 02:19:04,712
and when the <i>Black Pearl</i> destroyed

2078
02:19:04,838 --> 02:19:06,756
the ship that Will was on,

2079
02:19:06,881 --> 02:19:10,093
because the <i>Dauntless</i> was there,
the power in these waters,

2080
02:19:10,218 --> 02:19:14,973
the <i>Black Pearl</i> left
without getting Will and the coin.

2081
02:19:15,098 --> 02:19:19,769
For the next eight years, the pirates
continued looking for all of the gold.

2082
02:19:19,894 --> 02:19:24,649
Finally, Elizabeth wearing the medallion
fell in the water.

2083
02:19:24,774 --> 02:19:28,278
The gold called to the pirates.
They came after it.

2084
02:19:28,403 --> 02:19:31,906
It was the last medallion,
the last piece they needed.

2085
02:19:32,031 --> 02:19:35,451
They thought Elizabeth had Turner blood.

2086
02:19:35,577 --> 02:19:39,330
Turner blood was the last blood
they needed to lift the curse.

2087
02:19:39,455 --> 02:19:43,001
Did I miss anything?
Does it make sense?

2088
02:19:43,126 --> 02:19:45,295
Go through the movie,
it's all there.

2089
02:19:45,420 --> 02:19:48,798
[Terry] Do you think
that the reason why

2090
02:19:48,923 --> 02:19:51,801
the ship was destroyed
at the very beginning,

2091
02:19:51,926 --> 02:19:54,846
was it the powder magazine,
or did the pirates attack?

2092
02:19:54,971 --> 02:20:00,643
Was it because the medallion
touched the water?

2093
02:20:00,768 --> 02:20:05,315
I think so. Otherwise, they were
just out searching for gold.

2094
02:20:05,440 --> 02:20:09,819
They'd have gotten lucky. The medallion
touching the water brought the pirates.

2095
02:20:09,944 --> 02:20:12,196
[Ted] And the appearance
of the <i>Dauntless.</i>

2096
02:20:12,322 --> 02:20:14,616
Again, the power in these waters.

2097
02:20:14,741 --> 02:20:19,162
While the <i>Black Pearl</i>
does have some amount of supernatural

2098
02:20:19,287 --> 02:20:23,207
associated with it... sequel.

2099
02:20:23,333 --> 02:20:25,627
It still can be sunk,
it can be damaged.

2100
02:20:25,752 --> 02:20:30,173
A 100-gun ship like the <i>Dauntless</i>
will turn it into kindling.

2101
02:20:30,298 --> 02:20:34,385
The pirates, discretion being
the better part of valor, took off.

2102
02:20:34,510 --> 02:20:37,138
Finally, we catch up to the story.

2103
02:20:37,263 --> 02:20:39,682
[Terry] Or we're simply lost in the fog.

2104
02:20:39,807 --> 02:20:43,353
- Another possibility.
- [Ted] It's an unnatural fog.

2105
02:20:43,478 --> 02:20:45,688
[Terry] Or maybe
Elizabeth's singing...

2106
02:20:45,813 --> 02:20:48,024
[Ted] Drove them away
or calmed them down.

2107
02:20:48,149 --> 02:20:51,861
Gibbs does say,

2108
02:20:51,986 --> 02:20:54,906
"Cursed pirates sail these waters."

2109
02:20:55,031 --> 02:20:57,408
Does that all make sense?

2110
02:20:57,533 --> 02:21:03,456
- Did I forget anything?
- [Terry] It's like fine clockwork.

2111
02:21:03,581 --> 02:21:06,626
[Ted] A very odd way
to give information in a movie.

2112
02:21:06,751 --> 02:21:10,088
- It seems to work.
- [Terry] We got away with it.

2113
02:21:10,213 --> 02:21:14,300
We're creating a new,
cinematic language.
