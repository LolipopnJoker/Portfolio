00:00:56,363 --> 00:00:58,198
<i>Look at the sonar.</i>

3
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,133
<i>Let me know what you find.</i>

4
00:01:00,135 --> 00:01:02,268
<i>So far
nothing new, my friend.</i>

5
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,072
<i>It just keeps getting worse.</i>

6
00:01:26,261 --> 00:01:29,661
D'Angelo, Marks,
talk to me.

7
00:01:29,663 --> 00:01:31,730
We've moved
to the sonar room.

8
00:01:31,732 --> 00:01:33,667
Just nine rescues so far.

9
00:01:34,635 --> 00:01:36,468
<i>It's a mess, man.</i>

10
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,372
<i>This is the worst
I've ever seen.</i>

11
00:01:39,074 --> 00:01:40,075
Help!

12
00:01:41,776 --> 00:01:43,309
Help!

13
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:45,644
Somebody help me!

14
00:01:45,646 --> 00:01:48,882
Help! Who's there?

15
00:01:52,419 --> 00:01:54,020
I got
one more survivor.

16
00:01:54,022 --> 00:01:55,587
Heading back
to the rescue vehicle now.

17
00:01:58,293 --> 00:01:59,758
Marks. D'Angelo.

18
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,160
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

19
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:02,728
I have no idea.

20
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,597
Listen.

21
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:17,377
<i>Jonas, we got
something outside the ship.</i>

22
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:19,647
<i>There's something out there.</i>

23
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,189
Here.

24
00:02:29,391 --> 00:02:30,489
You okay, pal?

25
00:02:35,263 --> 00:02:37,297
Oh, my God.

26
00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:38,730
<i>Something's crushing the hull.</i>

27
00:02:38,732 --> 00:02:41,267
Get back to
the rescue vehicle. Now.

28
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:42,636
We're right behind you.

29
00:02:44,738 --> 00:02:46,471
You guys, move!

30
00:02:46,473 --> 00:02:47,708
Got him. Slide him up.

31
00:02:49,244 --> 00:02:51,311
Marks. D'Angelo. Report.

32
00:02:51,313 --> 00:02:52,711
You almost here?

33
00:02:52,713 --> 00:02:54,881
<i>Jonas, listen to me.
We're trapped!</i>

34
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:55,815
What?

35
00:02:55,817 --> 00:02:57,417
The impact jammed the hatch!

36
00:02:57,419 --> 00:02:58,619
Coming back.

37
00:03:01,156 --> 00:03:02,454
<i>The sub
is starting to collapse.</i>

38
00:03:02,456 --> 00:03:03,755
Marks!

39
00:03:03,757 --> 00:03:04,756
<i>Jonas,
we need you down here</i>

40
00:03:04,758 --> 00:03:06,125
before it's too late.

41
00:03:07,796 --> 00:03:09,963
The sub's been breached.

42
00:03:09,965 --> 00:03:11,264
<i>There's water everywhere.</i>

43
00:03:11,266 --> 00:03:12,899
<i>Jonas,
the room is flooding.</i>

44
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,701
<i>Marks, we gotta
get this hatch open.</i>

45
00:03:15,703 --> 00:03:17,270
<i>Come on, Jonas.
Where are you?</i>

46
00:03:17,272 --> 00:03:18,938
- <i>It's not gonna work!</i>
- <i>Let us out!</i>

47
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,472
<i>Jonas, hurry, please!</i>

48
00:03:20,474 --> 00:03:22,342
<i>We just need
more time! Don't leave us!</i>

49
00:03:22,344 --> 00:03:24,344
<i>Jonas!</i>

50
00:03:24,346 --> 00:03:26,346
<i>Let us know
when you're here!</i>

51
00:03:26,348 --> 00:03:27,479
<i>Don't give up!</i>

52
00:03:27,481 --> 00:03:28,881
<i>Jonas, please!</i>

53
00:03:28,883 --> 00:03:30,116
<i>Come down here, now!
Where are you?</i>

54
00:03:30,118 --> 00:03:31,252
<i>Jonas!</i>

55
00:03:38,692 --> 00:03:39,861
You've lost your mind!

56
00:03:40,627 --> 00:03:41,828
Back off, Heller.

57
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,197
If we go back, everyone dies.

58
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:45,666
Everyone.

59
00:03:57,745 --> 00:03:59,180
What have you done?

60
00:05:32,407 --> 00:05:35,640
Are we living the dream here
or what?

61
00:05:35,642 --> 00:05:38,677
Welcome to <i>Mana One,</i>
Mr. Morris.

62
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:40,246
Get that thing away from me.

63
00:05:40,248 --> 00:05:41,746
What are you doing?

64
00:05:41,748 --> 00:05:45,585
Come on, bring it in.
There we go.

65
00:05:45,587 --> 00:05:47,086
Good to see you again,
Mr. Morris.

66
00:05:47,088 --> 00:05:48,687
- Yeah.
- This way, please.

67
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:51,190
Hey, you always smell so nice.
What is that? Sandalwood?

68
00:05:51,192 --> 00:05:53,758
It's impressive so far,
I'll say.

69
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,128
Oh, here they are.

70
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,829
Do you remember
my daughter Suyin?

71
00:05:56,831 --> 00:05:58,264
Our chief marine biologist.

72
00:05:58,266 --> 00:05:59,565
Hi.

73
00:06:10,711 --> 00:06:11,911
Sorry, what was that?

74
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,815
- I didn't catch it.
- Uh...

75
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,416
She says she likes your hat.

76
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,152
- Oh.
- Oh, yeah.

77
00:06:19,154 --> 00:06:20,221
Yeah.

78
00:06:23,657 --> 00:06:26,259
- Let's go.
- Why don't we go? Yeah.

79
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,899
Your granddaughter's
a pistol.

80
00:06:31,698 --> 00:06:32,901
Okay.

81
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:35,370
What have we here?

82
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:39,671
This is, um,

83
00:06:39,673 --> 00:06:42,041
really ugly.

84
00:06:42,043 --> 00:06:43,242
You know, I realize that

85
00:06:43,244 --> 00:06:44,443
we're under construction
and everything,

86
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:45,878
but I really think that

87
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,813
a world-class
research institute

88
00:06:47,815 --> 00:06:50,715
deserves
a world-class entrance.

89
00:06:50,717 --> 00:06:53,354
Yeah, I couldn't agree more.

90
00:06:54,489 --> 00:06:56,055
<i>O-Level.</i>

91
00:06:58,593 --> 00:07:00,426
Whoa!

92
00:07:00,428 --> 00:07:02,628
Welcome to the O-Level.

93
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,031
Nice.

94
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:06,866
This is
our central hub,

95
00:07:06,868 --> 00:07:08,834
from which
researchers will access

96
00:07:08,836 --> 00:07:11,806
all five labs
once it's finished.

97
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:14,309
Wow!

98
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,413
Oh, look at that.

99
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,884
That's not something
you see every day.

100
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:30,189
Did you have
those whales here on cue?

101
00:07:30,191 --> 00:07:34,126
I might have lured them
with some whale songs.

102
00:07:34,128 --> 00:07:38,132
This is Lucy
and her daughter Gracie.

103
00:07:39,534 --> 00:07:40,866
Incredible.

104
00:07:43,404 --> 00:07:44,503
Wow!

105
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:45,770
<i>Dive control level.</i>

106
00:07:45,772 --> 00:07:47,106
- Here we are.
- Please.

107
00:07:47,108 --> 00:07:49,811
Follow me quickly.
I hope we are on time.

108
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:51,277
Come on in.

109
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:53,414
Oh.

110
00:07:54,082 --> 00:07:55,147
Oh, man.

111
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:56,816
I'd like you
to meet our engineer

112
00:07:56,818 --> 00:07:58,584
and sub designer, Jaxx.

113
00:07:58,586 --> 00:07:59,751
Hey, Doc.

114
00:07:59,753 --> 00:08:01,921
- Hello.
- Hi.

115
00:08:01,923 --> 00:08:04,523
Doctor Heller.
Our medical officer.

116
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:05,925
Nice to meet you.

117
00:08:05,927 --> 00:08:07,293
You're like Bones, huh?

118
00:08:07,295 --> 00:08:10,496
DJ here pilots
our remote explorer.

119
00:08:10,498 --> 00:08:11,697
How's it going?

120
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,132
You're my first billionaire.

121
00:08:14,235 --> 00:08:15,901
And of course, Mac,
our station chief.

122
00:08:15,903 --> 00:08:17,503
Mr. Morris, just in time.

123
00:08:17,505 --> 00:08:18,571
So I keep hearing.

124
00:08:18,573 --> 00:08:20,072
Try that.

125
00:08:20,074 --> 00:08:21,340
Just in time for what?

126
00:08:21,342 --> 00:08:23,276
<i>Good morning,
Mr. Morris.</i>

127
00:08:23,278 --> 00:08:25,678
Lori Taylor,
our mission pilot.

128
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,013
<i>Hi, Mr. Morris.</i>

129
00:08:27,015 --> 00:08:28,014
Welcome on board.
It's good to have you.

130
00:08:28,016 --> 00:08:29,148
<i>Hey.</i>

131
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,416
How's it going down there?

132
00:08:30,418 --> 00:08:32,451
Where'd you learn
how to pilot a sub?

133
00:08:32,453 --> 00:08:34,487
<i>I spent ten years
with a certain</i>

134
00:08:34,489 --> 00:08:36,289
whale-saving
environmental group

135
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,424
that shall remain unnamed
for legal reasons.

136
00:08:38,426 --> 00:08:40,226
Yeah, ask her
if she ever blew up

137
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,761
a whaling ship
with a homemade torpedo.

138
00:08:41,763 --> 00:08:42,828
Hey.

139
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:43,963
No.

140
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:48,000
That is a good hire.

141
00:08:48,002 --> 00:08:49,502
<i>Eleven in two.</i>

142
00:08:49,504 --> 00:08:53,272
<i>Water temperature
is at six degrees.</i>

143
00:08:53,274 --> 00:08:55,241
Mac, we are
through the thermocline.

144
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,310
We are approaching
11,000 meters.

145
00:08:57,312 --> 00:08:59,981
One hundred meters
from the bottom.

146
00:09:00,682 --> 00:09:02,114
<i>Maybe.</i>

147
00:09:02,116 --> 00:09:04,016
<i>Maybe from the bottom.</i>

148
00:09:04,018 --> 00:09:06,852
"Maybe"? What does
he mean, "maybe"?

149
00:09:06,854 --> 00:09:08,888
Come on. Look at this.

150
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,556
Since 1875,

151
00:09:10,558 --> 00:09:12,992
we've all believed
the Mariana Trench

152
00:09:12,994 --> 00:09:14,660
was the deepest place
on Earth.

153
00:09:14,662 --> 00:09:17,363
I've had a theory that
what we think is the bottom

154
00:09:17,365 --> 00:09:20,099
might actually be a layer
of hydrogen sulfide.

155
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,767
Beneath that cloud,

156
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,336
and a freezing
cold thermocline,

157
00:09:23,338 --> 00:09:25,638
there could be
a completely new world.

158
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,173
Wow!

159
00:09:27,175 --> 00:09:28,874
The <i>Origin</i> is about to see
if my father is right.

160
00:09:28,876 --> 00:09:30,710
If there is warm water below,

161
00:09:30,712 --> 00:09:33,579
that means we're going to be
the first to see it.

162
00:09:33,581 --> 00:09:35,047
And what if you're wrong?

163
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:38,718
Then you have wasted
$1.3 billion.

164
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:42,290
You're kidding.

165
00:09:45,026 --> 00:09:46,525
He's kidding, right?

166
00:09:46,527 --> 00:09:47,794
Copy that.

167
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,028
Wait. What?

168
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,565
Ten meters.
Approaching boundary.

169
00:09:56,003 --> 00:09:57,903
Hovering at five meters.

170
00:09:57,905 --> 00:09:59,004
Full stop.

171
00:09:59,006 --> 00:10:00,306
Final checks.

172
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,640

00:10:40,148 --> 00:10:42,214
<i>It's a cloud.
It is not the bottom.</i>

187
00:10:42,216 --> 00:10:44,250
Lori, be careful.
We don't know the depth

188
00:10:44,252 --> 00:10:45,651
<i>on the other side of this.</i>

189
00:10:45,653 --> 00:10:47,153
<i>The sea floor could come
right up on you.</i>

190
00:10:47,155 --> 00:10:49,524
<i>Copy that, Mac.
We're ready.</i>

191
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,633
You guys,
we are through!

192
00:11:00,635 --> 00:11:03,436
<i>I have multiple
small sonar contacts.</i>

193
00:11:03,438 --> 00:11:05,271
<i>There is life down here.</i>

194
00:11:05,273 --> 00:11:06,607
<i>Congratulations!</i>

195
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,310
Deploying the lights.

196
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,665
Lights deployed.
I'm gonna come around.

197
00:11:45,146 --> 00:11:47,513
Whoa!

198
00:11:47,515 --> 00:11:50,384
Oh, my goodness.

199
00:12:08,837 --> 00:12:10,338
- Wow!
- Whoa!

200
00:12:11,506 --> 00:12:12,671
Mac, tell me
you're getting this.

201
00:12:12,673 --> 00:12:14,440
We're getting
all of it, Lori.

202
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,311
Got a lot of
smiling faces up here.

203
00:12:21,984 --> 00:12:24,485
DJ, we got positive terrain
to launch the rover.

204
00:12:25,052 --> 00:12:26,820
Copy.

205
00:12:26,822 --> 00:12:29,121
Launch is all yours.

206
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,324
Okay.

207
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:32,760
Rover is

208
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:35,797
free.

209
00:12:37,431 --> 00:12:38,666
Copy.

210
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,804
<i>Water temperature</i>

211
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,474
<i>below three degrees Celsius.</i>

212
00:12:54,282 --> 00:12:56,651
How is this possible?

213
00:12:58,185 --> 00:13:00,753
This ecosystem
is completely cut off

214
00:13:00,755 --> 00:13:02,154
from the rest of the ocean

215
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,156
by the freezing
cold thermocline.

216
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,559
We should find
all sorts of species

217
00:13:06,561 --> 00:13:08,561
completely unknown to science.

218
00:13:08,563 --> 00:13:11,465
Sounds like a good investment.

219
00:13:15,369 --> 00:13:17,136
Lori, I have a contact.

220
00:13:17,138 --> 00:13:19,273
Bearing zero eight zero.

221
00:13:21,108 --> 00:13:22,943
Huh. It's big.

222
00:13:22,945 --> 00:13:24,743
Oh, it's huge.

223
00:13:24,745 --> 00:13:26,080
And it's moving fast.

224
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:30,786
DJ,
is the rover seeing this?

225
00:13:32,653 --> 00:13:33,787
Negative.

226
00:13:33,789 --> 00:13:35,723
Let me try
and bring up some more lights.

227
00:13:41,997 --> 00:13:44,096
Rover One, <i>signal interrupted.</i>

228
00:13:44,098 --> 00:13:46,098
Whoa! I just lost telemetry.

229
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,301
What the hell?

230
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,770
<i>Origin,</i> recommend

231
00:13:51,772 --> 00:13:53,105
an immediate right turn
to three-five-zero.

232
00:13:53,107 --> 00:13:54,508
<i>This could be a landslide.</i>

233
00:14:03,584 --> 00:14:05,417
Last time I checked,
landslides don't make

234
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:07,219
<i>90-degree turns.</i>

235
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,223
It's right on us!
It's right on us!

236
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,527
What the hell was that?

237
00:14:17,131 --> 00:14:18,631
Lori, what's going on
down there?

238
00:14:18,633 --> 00:14:19,531
You guys...

239
00:14:19,533 --> 00:14:21,469
- What?
- Come look at this.

240
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:24,737
Whoa!

241
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,806
What could do that
to the rover?

242
00:14:26,808 --> 00:14:29,009
I don't think
I wanna know.

243
00:14:30,645 --> 00:14:32,146
It's coming back.

244
00:14:35,349 --> 00:14:36,649
Oh, my God!

245
00:14:36,651 --> 00:14:38,317
<i>Let's get out of here.
Blow the tanks.</i>

246
00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:39,585
<i>I'm trying.
It's not working!</i>

247
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,253
- <i>It's not starting!</i>
- <i>Mac, help!</i>

248
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,789
- Whole system's down!
- Oh, my God.

249
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:45,224
<i>Oh, my God. DJ, Mac.
There's something down here.</i>

250
00:14:45,226 --> 00:14:46,592
<i>Jonas was right.</i>

251
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,396
<i>Jonas was right! Do you co...</i>

252
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,632
Lori, come in.

253
00:14:53,634 --> 00:14:54,903
<i>Origin,</i> can you hear me?

254
00:14:55,871 --> 00:14:58,972
<i>Origin,</i> please respond.

255
00:14:58,974 --> 00:15:00,675
- Come on.
- Lori, come in.

256
00:15:03,979 --> 00:15:05,613
Wall, can you hear me?

257
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,184
Toshi?

258
00:15:12,653 --> 00:15:15,989
Gather around, people.
Options.

259
00:15:15,991 --> 00:15:17,090
Not great.

260
00:15:17,092 --> 00:15:18,657
We know they're alive.

261
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:21,127
I've still got telemetry
on their vitals.

262
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,962
How long do they have?

263
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,164
Maybe 18 hours.

264
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,364
Ballast valves
are jammed,

265
00:15:25,366 --> 00:15:26,866
which means
it can't rise by itself.

266
00:15:26,868 --> 00:15:28,001
If we attempt to tow it,

267
00:15:28,003 --> 00:15:30,335
it's fifty-fifty
that the tanks will explode,

268
00:15:30,337 --> 00:15:31,770
and breach the capsule.

269
00:15:31,772 --> 00:15:33,840
- Can't we go hatch-to-hatch?
- Not a chance.

270
00:15:33,842 --> 00:15:36,442
The external camera's
showing severe hatch damage.

271
00:15:36,444 --> 00:15:37,944
We have to try something.

272
00:15:37,946 --> 00:15:39,511
They're six miles down

273
00:15:39,513 --> 00:15:41,680
and no one has ever attempted
a rescue at that depth.

274
00:15:41,682 --> 00:15:43,250
Well, that's not exactly true.

275
00:15:44,285 --> 00:15:46,418
No. No way.

276
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,753
We can handle this.

277
00:15:47,755 --> 00:15:49,421
Not at 11,000 meters,
you can't.

278
00:15:49,423 --> 00:15:52,458
We've gone 5,000 meters.
8,000 meters.

279
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,493
At some point,
it just becomes a number.

280
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,062
Why don't you try this number?

281
00:15:56,064 --> 00:15:59,032
Three. That's how many people
have actually attempted

282
00:15:59,034 --> 00:16:00,934
a rescue below 10,000 meters.

283
00:16:00,936 --> 00:16:02,735
And the number one.

284
00:16:02,737 --> 00:16:04,403
That's how many are left alive
to talk about it.

285
00:16:04,405 --> 00:16:05,704
One man. Jonas Taylor.

286
00:16:05,706 --> 00:16:07,439
And look what happened
to that one man

287
00:16:07,441 --> 00:16:08,975
the last time he went
to these depths.

288
00:16:08,977 --> 00:16:10,375
He saved eleven people,

289
00:16:10,377 --> 00:16:11,577
including you, Heller.
That's what happened.

290
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:13,113
He left our friends to die,

291
00:16:13,115 --> 00:16:15,414
because he had
pressure-induced psychosis.

292
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,382
Come on, Heller.
That was your diagnosis.

293
00:16:17,384 --> 00:16:19,585
Jonas said
something attacked them.

294
00:16:19,587 --> 00:16:21,955
Something big enough to
take out a nuclear submarine.

295
00:16:21,957 --> 00:16:23,223
He's a drunk.

296
00:16:23,225 --> 00:16:24,690
You're not listening!
You're not listening!

297
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,325
He washed up on a beach
in Thailand.

298
00:16:26,327 --> 00:16:27,794
- Did you hear what Lori said?
- I'm listening. I heard it.

299
00:16:27,796 --> 00:16:28,029
- Were you there?
- That's enough.

300
00:16:30,631 --> 00:16:33,867
We all heard
Lori's last transmission.

301
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:35,267
We have to consider

302
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:36,702
that <i>Origin</i> may have
encountered

303
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,304
something similar to what
Jonas Taylor described.

304
00:16:39,306 --> 00:16:41,507
Something he was able
to escape from.

305
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:43,709
<i>Ba!</i> Please.

306
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,478
Prep the helicopter.

307
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,716
We must go to Thailand.

308
00:17:24,718 --> 00:17:26,019
Your boat,

309
00:17:26,021 --> 00:17:27,854
she's killing me.

310
00:17:27,856 --> 00:17:30,056
Number one engine
slips out of the gear,

311
00:17:30,058 --> 00:17:31,557
and there's some leak
in the hydraulics.

312
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:33,226
Hey, I'll take a look
at it tonight.

313
00:17:33,228 --> 00:17:34,459
That's what you said
last night

314
00:17:34,461 --> 00:17:35,694
and the night before that,

315
00:17:35,696 --> 00:17:37,563
and the night before that.

316
00:17:37,565 --> 00:17:38,730
Hey, I'm working up to it.

317
00:17:38,732 --> 00:17:40,499
You drink too much.

318
00:17:40,501 --> 00:17:41,835
Hey, now
you're only saying that

319
00:17:41,837 --> 00:17:44,838
because I literally have
a beer in my hand.

320
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,539
You always have beer
in your hand.

321
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:48,777
You know why?

322
00:17:49,677 --> 00:17:51,543
Because I drink too much?

323
00:18:14,336 --> 00:18:18,004
Now this is shaping up to be
an eventful Tuesday evening.

324
00:18:18,006 --> 00:18:20,306
You know
I like to make an entrance.

325
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:21,673
Hell, Mac, after five years,

326
00:18:21,675 --> 00:18:23,475
just showing up
is making an entrance.

327
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,644
What? You're living
above a bar? Really?

328
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,648
Figured it was the only way
to get you to come visit.

329
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,052
Jonas,
allow me to introduce...

330
00:18:33,054 --> 00:18:34,720
It's an honor to meet you,
Doctor Zhang.

331
00:18:34,722 --> 00:18:37,556
Always had a tremendous
respect for your work.

332
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:38,992
You're too kind, Mr. Taylor.

333
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:40,960
Yeah, no, I'm not.
You're a good man.

334
00:18:40,962 --> 00:18:43,495
Hey, can I offer
either of you two a beer?

335
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,899
'Cause I'm gonna have a beer.

336
00:18:45,901 --> 00:18:47,834
It's not a social call, Jonas.

337
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:50,970
You mean you didn't helicopter
in just to say "hi"?

338
00:18:50,972 --> 00:18:53,772
You wound me, Mac.

339
00:18:53,774 --> 00:18:56,575
- We have a serious...
- Problem?

340
00:18:56,577 --> 00:18:58,311
Thought so.

341
00:18:58,313 --> 00:19:00,179
Just like you know

342
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,414
I don't dive anymore.

343
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:03,649
Done being responsible
for people, Mac.

344
00:19:03,651 --> 00:19:04,951
Mr. Taylor...

345
00:19:04,953 --> 00:19:06,652
Hey, I mean no offense,
Doctor Zhang.

346
00:19:06,654 --> 00:19:08,720
I mean, if there was
two people on this planet

347
00:19:08,722 --> 00:19:10,522
that could get me
back into the water,

348
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,557
it's probably you two.

349
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:13,960
But you can't.

350
00:19:13,962 --> 00:19:17,163
You're gonna tell me your
problem, and I'll say no.

351
00:19:17,165 --> 00:19:19,032
You're gonna offer me money.

352
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:20,166
I'll still say no.

353
00:19:20,168 --> 00:19:22,768
You're gonna appeal
to my better nature,

354
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,404
and I'm gonna say no.

355
00:19:24,406 --> 00:19:26,406
Because I don't have one.

356
00:19:26,408 --> 00:19:29,474
So I say,
why don't we sit down?

357
00:19:29,476 --> 00:19:31,110
We'll enjoy a couple of beers,

358
00:19:31,112 --> 00:19:32,946
and then we can
get you on your way.

359
00:19:34,349 --> 00:19:36,548
Jonas.

360
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,718
This happened this morning.

361
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,988
<i>Let's get out
of here. Blow the tanks!</i>

362
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,588
<i>I'm trying.
It's not working!</i>

363
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,924
<i>It's not starting!
Whole system's down!</i>

364
00:19:44,926 --> 00:19:46,793
<i>Mac, help!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</i>

365
00:19:46,795 --> 00:19:49,594
<i>DJ, Mac.
There's something down here.</i>

366
00:19:49,596 --> 00:19:50,797
<i>Jonas was right.</i>

367
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,098
<i>Jonas was right!
Do you co...</i>

368
00:19:53,168 --> 00:19:54,700
It's Lori.

369
00:19:54,702 --> 00:19:57,136
Your ex-wife
and her crew are trapped

370
00:19:57,138 --> 00:19:59,571
below 11,000 meters.

371
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:00,974
I fear they may
have encountered

372
00:20:00,976 --> 00:20:03,376
the same species
you did down there.

373
00:20:03,378 --> 00:20:07,113
I have divers with less
experience willing to go.

374
00:20:07,115 --> 00:20:09,082
But I feel
I owe it to my crew

375
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:12,821
to give this rescue
the best chance of success.

376
00:20:14,889 --> 00:20:16,724
Please.

377
00:20:24,698 --> 00:20:26,734
Lori,
hand me that hexa key.

378
00:20:27,902 --> 00:20:28,937
Thanks.

379
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:34,639
Oh.

380
00:20:34,641 --> 00:20:36,976
Okay.

381
00:20:36,978 --> 00:20:38,411
Okay, if we can
short out the firewall,

382
00:20:38,413 --> 00:20:40,547
I can... I can probably
reboot the computers.

383
00:20:43,385 --> 00:20:45,552
Okay. Try it now.

384
00:20:50,358 --> 00:20:52,559
Auxiliary power's back.

385
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:57,897
Heaters are online.

386
00:20:57,899 --> 00:20:59,432
There's no way that we'll
get the engine started,

387
00:20:59,434 --> 00:21:02,235
but we might be able
to get the ballast tanks back.

388
00:21:03,704 --> 00:21:05,304
What are you doing?
Taking notes?

389
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:07,142
Letter to my wife.

390
00:21:10,245 --> 00:21:11,712
Just in case.

391
00:21:12,514 --> 00:21:13,712
Hey.

392
00:21:13,714 --> 00:21:15,448
We got this.

393
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,716
Step by step.

394
00:21:17,718 --> 00:21:20,721
Come on. Give me
that fighting octopus.

395
00:21:30,899 --> 00:21:32,432
See?

396
00:21:32,434 --> 00:21:33,968
Works every time.

397
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:42,208
No.

398
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,709
- What?
- We gotta can the lights.

399
00:22:04,933 --> 00:22:07,400
Turn out the lights.

400
00:22:07,402 --> 00:22:09,102
<i>There was
something down there with us.</i>

401
00:22:09,104 --> 00:22:10,303
<i>How can you be
sure if there were</i>

402
00:22:10,305 --> 00:22:12,405
<i>no observation windows
on your craft?</i>

403
00:22:12,407 --> 00:22:14,107
<i>'Cause whatever it was</i>

404
00:22:14,109 --> 00:22:17,410
<i>caved in the entire starboard
side of a nuclear submarine.</i>

405
00:22:17,412 --> 00:22:18,911
<i>That wasn't my imagination.</i>

406
00:22:18,913 --> 00:22:21,180
<i>Is that why
you blew the hatch mid-rescue?</i>

407
00:22:21,182 --> 00:22:24,749
<i>Hey, look, I brought 11 men
back safe and sound.</i>

408
00:22:24,751 --> 00:22:26,352
<i>You left
eight more to die</i>

409
00:22:26,354 --> 00:22:27,520
<i>because you panicked.</i>

410
00:22:27,522 --> 00:22:29,856
<i>If I hadn't blown the hatch,</i>

411
00:22:29,858 --> 00:22:32,024
<i>we all would have been
killed by that thing.</i>

412
00:22:32,026 --> 00:22:33,326
<i>There was no thing.</i>

413
00:22:33,328 --> 00:22:34,827
<i>There was no evidence
of anything.</i>

414
00:22:34,829 --> 00:22:36,095
<i>Because
it was destroyed</i>

415
00:22:36,097 --> 00:22:37,662
<i>in the explosion, Heller.</i>

416
00:22:37,664 --> 00:22:40,867
<i>Look, there was no time left!
So I made the call!</i>

417
00:22:40,869 --> 00:22:42,767
<i>And you left
our friends there to die</i>

418
00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:45,006
<i>in an act of cowardice!</i>

419
00:22:47,175 --> 00:22:49,708
What do you think
happened down there?

420
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,244
He lost it.

421
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:53,012
And now we're
about to send him

422
00:22:53,014 --> 00:22:55,148
into the exact same situation.

423
00:22:56,618 --> 00:22:57,950
Excuse me, Suyin.

424
00:22:57,952 --> 00:22:59,919
I'm sorry to interrupt you,
but we need you.

425
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:01,389
It's an emergency.

426
00:23:02,624 --> 00:23:04,656
What's wrong, Jaxx?

427
00:23:04,658 --> 00:23:06,025
Now they're leaking oxygen.

428
00:23:06,027 --> 00:23:07,896
They've got a couple of hours.
Maybe more.

429
00:23:09,797 --> 00:23:11,330
- I'm going.
- No.

430
00:23:11,332 --> 00:23:12,532
Wait, what?

431
00:23:12,534 --> 00:23:14,467
I'll take one of the gliders,
grab the <i>Origin,</i>

432
00:23:14,469 --> 00:23:16,135
- and tow her up.
- Wait!

433
00:23:16,137 --> 00:23:18,306
If the <i>Origin's</i> ballast tanks
blow, you're gonna die, too.

434
00:23:18,907 --> 00:23:20,909
We have to try.

435
00:23:23,744 --> 00:23:25,446
Mummy?

436
00:23:28,149 --> 00:23:29,882
Meiying.

437
00:23:34,155 --> 00:23:35,223
Um...

438
00:23:45,699 --> 00:23:47,068
Uh...

439
00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:09,924
Communications check!

440
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:14,894
Good to go.

441
00:24:14,896 --> 00:24:18,364
Suyin, you are go for launch.

442
00:24:18,366 --> 00:24:19,766
Richard Byrd.

443
00:24:41,322 --> 00:24:44,092
<i>Auto descent
sequence initiated.</i>

444
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:48,863
- Hey, Meiying.
- Hi.

445
00:25:18,192 --> 00:25:21,060
- Sir, we've got a new problem.
- It's your daughter.

446
00:25:21,062 --> 00:25:23,129
She took a glider
to try and save them.

447
00:25:23,131 --> 00:25:24,463
Why did you let her go?

448
00:25:24,465 --> 00:25:26,932
Trust me,
I didn't let her do anything.

449
00:25:26,934 --> 00:25:28,367
I was sort of
under the impression

450
00:25:28,369 --> 00:25:29,935
you're supposed to try
to save people

451
00:25:29,937 --> 00:25:30,803
who are dying
on the bottom of the ocean.

452
00:25:30,805 --> 00:25:32,071
Who's he?

453
00:25:32,073 --> 00:25:34,042
I'm the guy
who paid for all this.

454
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:36,609
Uh-huh.

455
00:25:36,611 --> 00:25:38,978
You know, he looks heroic
and he walks fast,

456
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:42,083
but he's kind of
got a negative attitude.

457
00:25:45,788 --> 00:25:47,053
What's the window?

458
00:25:47,055 --> 00:25:48,956
It'll be close.

459
00:25:50,825 --> 00:25:52,091
Who are you?

460
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:53,326
I'm the one
that designed all this.

461
00:25:53,328 --> 00:25:55,194
So my life's in your hands?

462
00:25:55,196 --> 00:25:58,331
Pretty much. That a problem?

463
00:25:58,333 --> 00:25:59,265
Nah.

464
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:00,466
You look like you might

465
00:26:00,468 --> 00:26:02,468
actually know
what you're doing.

466
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,670
<i>Dive control level.</i>

467
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,205
Oh, I'm sorry.

468
00:26:06,207 --> 00:26:09,608
Mac, have Doctor Heller
meet us in the medical bay.

469
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:10,811
Heller?

470
00:26:10,813 --> 00:26:12,845
Did I not mention that?

471
00:26:12,847 --> 00:26:14,282
You mother...

472
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,586
He's in perfect shape.

473
00:26:20,588 --> 00:26:22,523
Just like the last time
you examined me.

474
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:27,226
Suyin took a glider
15 minutes ago.

475
00:26:27,228 --> 00:26:28,861
She's planning
on taking the <i>Origin</i> back up.

476
00:26:28,863 --> 00:26:30,162
Take me to the sub.

477
00:26:30,164 --> 00:26:32,231
- We're not done here.
- Yeah, we are.

478
00:26:32,233 --> 00:26:33,466
Lori's running out of air,

479
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:34,967
and we're in
international waters,

480
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:36,302
which means legally

481
00:26:36,304 --> 00:26:38,137
I can beat the ever-loving
shit out of you

482
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:40,074
and get away with it.

483
00:26:41,509 --> 00:26:42,942
It's true.

484
00:26:42,944 --> 00:26:44,178
Legally, I mean.

485
00:26:45,446 --> 00:26:47,515
Good thing
he doesn't hold a grudge.

486
00:26:48,182 --> 00:26:49,582
Jonas, you do know

487
00:26:49,584 --> 00:26:51,384
that this sub is rated
for 12,000 meters, right?

488
00:26:51,386 --> 00:26:53,552
Like the one leaking
on the ocean floor?

489
00:26:53,554 --> 00:26:55,822
Ah. Good point.

490
00:26:55,824 --> 00:26:57,356
- We good?
- Yep.

491
00:26:57,358 --> 00:26:58,825
Once you strip back
the safeties

492
00:26:58,827 --> 00:27:01,394
and go full manual,
like I know you're gonna do,

493
00:27:01,396 --> 00:27:02,796
the system's gonna
have problems

494
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:05,297
trying to keep up
with your pressure changes.

495
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:06,999
Try not to blow
your ears out, brother.

496
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:09,070
Thanks, mate.

497
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,984
Hello, skipper.

498
00:27:24,986 --> 00:27:26,921
You must be the crazy guy.

499
00:27:27,722 --> 00:27:29,555
Now who called me that?

500
00:27:29,557 --> 00:27:31,359
My mom. Doctor Heller.

501
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,027
Yeah, well, I'm not crazy.

502
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:37,263
I've just seen things
no one else has.

503
00:27:37,265 --> 00:27:39,900
That's the definition
of crazy.

504
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:45,940
Backup power. Backup power...

505
00:27:50,813 --> 00:27:52,445
So where are your parents?

506
00:27:52,447 --> 00:27:55,181
My mom's trying
to bring our friends back

507
00:27:55,183 --> 00:27:57,483
from the bottom of the ocean.

508
00:27:57,485 --> 00:28:01,487
My dad's with a Pilates
instructor in Taipei.

509
00:28:01,489 --> 00:28:04,256
Granddad says
Mom needs to move on,

510
00:28:04,258 --> 00:28:06,158
but Mom says
she needs some more time

511
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,227
because she was
married to an a-hole.

512
00:28:08,229 --> 00:28:10,231
Sounds like
your mom's got a point.

513
00:28:14,669 --> 00:28:16,435
You know a lot.

514
00:28:16,437 --> 00:28:18,973
Eight-year-olds
hear everything.

515
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:22,677
Mind if I give it a try?

516
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:27,048
Bye.

517
00:28:32,053 --> 00:28:33,287
Hey, Crazy.

518
00:28:34,655 --> 00:28:37,590
Is my mom gonna die?

519
00:28:37,592 --> 00:28:40,894
I'll have <i>Captain Bubbles</i>
and your mom back in no time.

520
00:28:40,896 --> 00:28:42,997
I promise.

521
00:28:48,002 --> 00:28:49,602

00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:10,316
Looks like he's diverted
all nonessential power

541
00:30:10,318 --> 00:30:12,318
like heat and life support
to the motors.

542
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,719
He's gonna black out.

543
00:30:16,892 --> 00:30:18,860
His blood gases are dropping.

544
00:30:20,929 --> 00:30:22,261
Jonas.

545
00:30:22,263 --> 00:30:23,764
<i>Tell Heller
I'm not slowing down.</i>

546
00:30:34,141 --> 00:30:35,274
<i>Suyin, be advised.</i>

547
00:30:35,276 --> 00:30:36,609
Evolution <i>is now en route.</i>

548
00:30:36,611 --> 00:30:38,243
Request you return
to <i>Mana One</i> immediately.

549
00:30:38,245 --> 00:30:39,478
<i>Negative.</i>

550
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,347
He can give us
an escort on our way up.

551
00:30:41,349 --> 00:30:43,315
Tell her to get
out of the way, Mac.

552
00:30:43,317 --> 00:30:44,750
More people means more risk

553
00:30:44,752 --> 00:30:46,185
<i>and she's in
way over her head.</i>

554
00:30:46,187 --> 00:30:48,623
Jonas, you just
told her yourself.

555
00:30:50,124 --> 00:30:51,423
What?

556
00:30:51,425 --> 00:30:52,859
The little green button
on your intercom,

557
00:30:52,861 --> 00:30:54,830
that's for single channel
communication.

558
00:30:55,763 --> 00:30:57,531
Brilliant.

559
00:31:05,874 --> 00:31:07,742
<i>Entering thermocline.</i>

560
00:31:18,686 --> 00:31:20,020
<i>Okay, Mac.</i>

561
00:31:20,022 --> 00:31:21,756
<i>I am through.</i>

562
00:31:23,457 --> 00:31:24,757
<i>Warning.</i>

563
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:27,794
<i>Pressure load
approaching 16,000 psi.</i>

564
00:31:27,796 --> 00:31:29,029
<i>At this speed,</i>

565
00:31:29,031 --> 00:31:30,596
<i>I'm gonna have to divert
power from the heaters</i>

566
00:31:30,598 --> 00:31:31,532
<i>and shut down anything
that could ice over.</i>

567
00:31:33,334 --> 00:31:34,635
<i>Call you from the other side.</i>

568
00:31:38,239 --> 00:31:41,141
You got Wi-Fi here?

569
00:31:41,143 --> 00:31:42,576
All right.

570
00:31:43,377 --> 00:31:44,710
Okay.

571
00:31:44,712 --> 00:31:46,578
Just... Just keep
pressure on that.

572
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,247
Toshi, is it still out there?

573
00:31:48,249 --> 00:31:49,682
I can't tell.

574
00:31:49,684 --> 00:31:51,552
I can't see anything
right now.

575
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:27,352
Oh.

576
00:32:27,354 --> 00:32:29,621
There it is.

577
00:32:29,623 --> 00:32:31,091
I've got visual
on the <i>Origin.</i>

578
00:32:31,093 --> 00:32:32,257
<i>I can see most of it.</i>

579
00:32:32,259 --> 00:32:34,094
Okay. They're alive.

580
00:32:34,096 --> 00:32:35,663
I'm going to set up to tow.

581
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,168
<i>Range to target. Six meters.</i>

582
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:43,302
<i>Four meters.</i>

583
00:32:43,304 --> 00:32:45,439
<i>Target locked.</i>

584
00:32:48,409 --> 00:32:50,476
Firing magnetic hook.

585
00:32:50,478 --> 00:32:52,277
Three. Two.

586
00:33:06,694 --> 00:33:08,862
Suyin? Are you okay?
What's happening?

587
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:11,663
<i>There is something
down here.</i>

588
00:33:11,665 --> 00:33:14,435
<i>Something just hit my ship.</i>

589
00:33:28,682 --> 00:33:30,482
<i>Suyin, what's happening?</i>

590
00:33:30,484 --> 00:33:31,951
It's a huge squid.

591
00:33:31,953 --> 00:33:33,385
It's got the glider.

592
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:34,954
<i>Warning.
Capsule pressure.</i>

593
00:33:34,956 --> 00:33:37,957
<i>Mac, it's crushing me.
It's crushing me!</i>

594
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:39,625
<i>I don't think
the glider can take it.</i>

595
00:33:39,627 --> 00:33:40,896
It's not gonna hold.

596
00:33:43,531 --> 00:33:46,498
<i>Suyin, engage
the pressure compensator.</i>

597
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,935
<i>Compensator
will not engage.</i>

598
00:33:48,937 --> 00:33:50,806
<i>Capsule breach in ten seconds.</i>

599
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:55,643
<i>Capsule breach in five sec...</i>

600
00:34:14,896 --> 00:34:17,032
My God!

601
00:34:19,835 --> 00:34:21,234
It's a shark.

602
00:34:21,236 --> 00:34:23,435
<i>It's like 20, 25 meters.</i>

603
00:34:23,437 --> 00:34:24,938
It's a megalodon.

604
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,607
<i>Impossible.</i>

605
00:34:28,777 --> 00:34:31,378
<i>I'm so glad I'm not crazy.</i>

606
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:38,017
Suyin, power down.

607
00:34:38,019 --> 00:34:39,451
It's drawn to the light.

608
00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:41,720
Shut everything down
and stay dark.

609
00:34:41,722 --> 00:34:43,522
<i>Shutdown in 30 seconds.</i>

610
00:34:43,524 --> 00:34:44,924
<i>Shutting off
everything but comms.</i>

611
00:34:44,926 --> 00:34:46,391
<i>It's circling back.</i>

612
00:34:46,393 --> 00:34:47,759
<i>Here it comes, Suyin.</i>

613
00:34:47,761 --> 00:34:49,595
<i>Shutdown in 25 seconds.</i>

614
00:34:49,597 --> 00:34:51,231
<i>Suyin, there's no time.</i>

615
00:34:51,233 --> 00:34:52,531
Turn off your lights.

616
00:34:52,533 --> 00:34:54,633
<i>Shutdown in 20 seconds.</i>

617
00:34:54,635 --> 00:34:56,836
<i>Turn them off. Now.</i>

618
00:34:56,838 --> 00:34:58,570
<i>Shutdown in 15 seconds.</i>

619
00:34:58,572 --> 00:34:59,941
<i>Mac, I have no control.</i>

620
00:35:01,877 --> 00:35:02,942
<i>Hurry.</i>

621
00:35:02,944 --> 00:35:04,978
<i>Ten, nine,</i>

622
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,511
<i>eight, seven,</i>

623
00:35:06,513 --> 00:35:08,850
<i>six, five...</i>

624
00:35:28,736 --> 00:35:30,402
Now's your chance.
Blow your tanks.

625
00:35:30,404 --> 00:35:32,972
No. I can help you
save the crew.

626
00:35:32,974 --> 00:35:35,674
<i>Your glider's damaged.
There's nothing you can do.</i>

627
00:35:35,676 --> 00:35:37,678
Blow your tanks now.

628
00:35:38,512 --> 00:35:39,848
Damn it.

629
00:35:47,122 --> 00:35:48,487
<i>Doctor Zhang,</i>

630
00:35:48,489 --> 00:35:50,189
<i>your daughter's clear.</i>

631
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:53,094
<i>I'm heading</i>
<i>for the</i> Origin <i>now.</i>

632
00:35:59,034 --> 00:36:01,535
<i>Range to target: three meters.</i>

633
00:36:10,946 --> 00:36:12,914
<i>Water extraction complete.</i>

634
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:24,225
Let's do this, sweetheart.

635
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:48,716
Tell me this isn't the world's
best "I told you so."

636
00:36:49,451 --> 00:36:50,682
You came all the way here

637
00:36:50,684 --> 00:36:52,018
just to tell me that,
didn't you?

638
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,987
Pretty much.

639
00:36:53,989 --> 00:36:56,257
Give me your hand.

640
00:37:00,795 --> 00:37:03,363
Ah, that doesn't look good.
Ready? One, two, three.

641
00:37:06,334 --> 00:37:08,201
She's coming.

642
00:37:08,203 --> 00:37:10,535
Let's move.

643
00:37:10,537 --> 00:37:13,206
If that thing hits us
while we're still attached...

644
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:15,076
Then we're all gonna die.

645
00:37:22,417 --> 00:37:23,684
Come on, I've got you.

646
00:37:24,752 --> 00:37:26,319
It's gonna be close.

647
00:37:26,321 --> 00:37:28,056
Come on, move, move!

648
00:37:30,258 --> 00:37:31,924
Go! Go! Go!

649
00:37:31,926 --> 00:37:34,227
We're not
gonna make it.

650
00:37:34,229 --> 00:37:36,164
- Come on.
- Toshi, hurry!

651
00:37:37,298 --> 00:37:38,565
Toshi, no!

652
00:38:08,762 --> 00:38:10,065
<i>Come in,</i> Evolution.

653
00:38:11,433 --> 00:38:13,334
<i>Jonas, come in.</i>

654
00:38:14,735 --> 00:38:17,005
<i>Are you all okay?</i>

655
00:38:19,908 --> 00:38:22,275
<i>Doctor Heller has vitals
on Lori and The Wall,</i>

656
00:38:22,277 --> 00:38:24,312
<i>but we don't have Toshi.</i>

657
00:38:25,113 --> 00:38:26,281
<i>Is Toshi okay?</i>

658
00:38:27,748 --> 00:38:30,118
<i>Jonas, is Toshi okay?</i>

659
00:38:31,453 --> 00:38:32,819
- All right.
- Nice and easy.

660
00:38:32,821 --> 00:38:34,287
Yeah. Yep.

661
00:38:34,289 --> 00:38:35,822
- Don't move her neck.
- Careful.

662
00:38:35,824 --> 00:38:38,793
That's good.
Grab a hold. We got her.

663
00:38:50,205 --> 00:38:52,637
You couldn't bring
Toshi back?

664
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:55,376
- Why not?
- He closed the hatch.

665
00:38:57,212 --> 00:38:58,712
He saved us.

666
00:38:59,746 --> 00:39:01,349
You left him.

667
00:39:03,717 --> 00:39:06,185
You left him
because that's who you are.

668
00:39:06,187 --> 00:39:08,620
You are the guy
who leaves people behind.

669
00:39:08,622 --> 00:39:10,289
You go that deep,

670
00:39:10,291 --> 00:39:12,158
you take your life
in your hands.

671
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,063
It was your choice
to send them down.

672
00:39:19,467 --> 00:39:22,303
This is why
I don't do this anymore, Mac.

673
00:39:34,549 --> 00:39:35,749
How is she?

674
00:39:38,386 --> 00:39:40,652
Well, the puncture
just missed her liver.

675
00:39:40,654 --> 00:39:42,288
She lost a lot of blood.

676
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:43,825
But she's stable.

677
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:52,800
Jonas.

678
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:57,205
I'm sorry.

679
00:39:58,306 --> 00:39:59,908
I was wrong.

680
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:04,045
You save Lori,

681
00:40:05,013 --> 00:40:06,814
we can call it even.

682
00:40:34,042 --> 00:40:36,375
I just want to apologize
for before.

683
00:40:36,377 --> 00:40:38,778
I was angry
and I lose my temper.

684
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:40,248
And you did save my...

685
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:43,351
You're naked.

686
00:40:47,956 --> 00:40:52,860
I know you did all you could.
So, thank you.

687
00:40:53,494 --> 00:40:54,961
Yeah.

688
00:40:54,963 --> 00:40:57,196
You're welcome.

689
00:40:57,198 --> 00:41:00,902
I know it's not easy
being the person who survives.

690
00:41:02,769 --> 00:41:04,637
I'm gonna go now.

691
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:05,770
You should
put on some clothes.

692
00:41:05,772 --> 00:41:08,074
Yep. That's the original plan.

693
00:41:08,076 --> 00:41:10,211
Okay, then. Carry on.

694
00:41:30,064 --> 00:41:32,865
Hi. Uh... I was...

695
00:41:32,867 --> 00:41:34,269
It's all good.

696
00:41:35,937 --> 00:41:38,571
Jonas and Lori were the worst
married couple ever, you know?

697
00:41:38,573 --> 00:41:39,771
Uh-huh.

698
00:41:39,773 --> 00:41:42,043
Whole experiment
was over in a year.

699
00:41:43,444 --> 00:41:45,313
I didn't ask anything.

700
00:41:46,281 --> 00:41:47,949
I know.

701
00:41:53,388 --> 00:41:56,822
This is what
attacked us. A megalodon.

702
00:41:56,824 --> 00:41:58,991
How big is that thing?

703
00:41:58,993 --> 00:42:03,129
Between 70 and 90 feet.
21 to 27 meters.

704
00:42:03,131 --> 00:42:07,033
The megalodon was the largest
shark that ever existed.

705
00:42:07,035 --> 00:42:08,934
It feared nothing.

706
00:42:08,936 --> 00:42:11,570
It had no predators.

707
00:42:11,572 --> 00:42:15,074
Its jaws were stronger
than any other animal, ever.

708
00:42:15,076 --> 00:42:17,943
The meg could bite
a whale in half,

709
00:42:17,945 --> 00:42:19,712
crushing through the bones.

710
00:42:19,714 --> 00:42:21,747
We are
in uncharted territory.

711
00:42:21,749 --> 00:42:23,149
Until today

712
00:42:23,151 --> 00:42:25,551
megalodons were thought
to have been extinct

713
00:42:25,553 --> 00:42:27,119
for over two million years.

714
00:42:27,121 --> 00:42:29,455
- Wrong.
- A living fossil.

715
00:42:29,457 --> 00:42:32,427
That living fossil
ate my friend.

716
00:42:34,128 --> 00:42:35,995
I cannot begin
to express

717
00:42:35,997 --> 00:42:37,863
my sadness for Toshi's death.

718
00:42:37,865 --> 00:42:39,932
We have the discovery
of a lifetime.

719
00:42:39,934 --> 00:42:42,403
This is what Toshi worked for.

720
00:42:44,272 --> 00:42:46,072
It's what
we've all worked for.

721
00:42:46,074 --> 00:42:49,575
But we're going
to have to proceed slowly.

722
00:42:49,577 --> 00:42:52,380
Yeah, that's really
not gonna work for me.

723
00:42:54,982 --> 00:42:57,151
What is <i>Mana One?</i>

724
00:42:57,885 --> 00:42:59,185
This station?

725
00:42:59,187 --> 00:43:01,155
Yes. And what's it doing?

726
00:43:02,023 --> 00:43:04,092
Hmm? Right now.

727
00:43:06,461 --> 00:43:07,760
Exactly.

728
00:43:07,762 --> 00:43:09,762
Nothing.

729
00:43:09,764 --> 00:43:11,364
20 million dollar rover, gone.

730
00:43:11,366 --> 00:43:14,233
Thirty million dollar sub,
gone.

731
00:43:14,235 --> 00:43:16,235
You are now sitting
in the most expensive

732
00:43:16,237 --> 00:43:18,971
underwater marine
biology day camp

733
00:43:18,973 --> 00:43:20,774
in human history.

734
00:43:20,776 --> 00:43:23,042
Hey, Crazy.

735
00:43:23,044 --> 00:43:24,477
And now that
we've actually

736
00:43:24,479 --> 00:43:26,080
found something amazing,

737
00:43:26,849 --> 00:43:29,081
we can't proceed slowly.

738
00:43:29,083 --> 00:43:32,251
Thank you
for keeping your promise.

739
00:43:32,253 --> 00:43:33,854
- You're welcome.
- You don't quit

740
00:43:33,856 --> 00:43:36,122
trying to get to the Moon
because you lose an astronaut.

741
00:43:36,124 --> 00:43:37,556
You charge forward,

742
00:43:37,558 --> 00:43:40,626
or someone else
will get there first.

743
00:43:40,628 --> 00:43:43,929
Other people will want
a piece of this thing,

744
00:43:43,931 --> 00:43:46,332
whether we like it or not.

745
00:43:46,334 --> 00:43:48,002
You seem to like it.

746
00:43:49,404 --> 00:43:53,439
- Excuse me?
- I said, you seem to like it.

747
00:43:53,441 --> 00:43:56,008
I'm sorry.
Is he part of this team?

748
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:58,411
You're damn right
he's a part of this team.

749
00:43:58,413 --> 00:44:00,279
Okay.

750
00:44:00,281 --> 00:44:01,747
You ever think
that Mother Nature

751
00:44:01,749 --> 00:44:04,316
might know what she's doing?

752
00:44:04,318 --> 00:44:09,221
The thermocline might
just be there for a reason?

753
00:44:09,223 --> 00:44:13,993
Hey, look, you wanna explore?
Go ahead, explore.

754
00:44:13,995 --> 00:44:17,096
But if you start sending
people back down there,

755
00:44:17,098 --> 00:44:19,632
don't call me
to come save your asses.

756
00:44:19,634 --> 00:44:21,233
Because in case what happened
down there

757
00:44:21,235 --> 00:44:23,202
wasn't clear to you,

758
00:44:23,204 --> 00:44:26,138
man vs. meg isn't a fight.

759
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:27,442
It's a slaughter.

760
00:44:42,089 --> 00:44:44,256
<i>O-Level.</i>

761
00:45:23,799 --> 00:45:26,632
What you people discovered
is an even bigger goldmine

762
00:45:26,634 --> 00:45:28,902
than we ever thought
possible.

763
00:45:28,904 --> 00:45:30,669
We are completely unprepared

764
00:45:30,671 --> 00:45:32,371
to deal with creatures
like megalodon.

765
00:45:32,373 --> 00:45:34,039
I understand,
and we can get prepared.

766
00:45:34,041 --> 00:45:35,942
I'm talking about
a long-term plan.

767
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:31,499
That's gonna be
the other alternative.

768
00:46:34,068 --> 00:46:35,369
What's that?

769
00:46:39,707 --> 00:46:40,809
My daughter.

770
00:46:50,284 --> 00:46:51,717
Jonas.

771
00:46:51,719 --> 00:46:52,986
- Did you see Meiying?
- We can't find Meiying.

772
00:46:52,988 --> 00:46:55,721
Meiying? Meiying?

773
00:46:55,723 --> 00:46:57,291
- I'll take this way.
- Let's try this way.

774
00:47:03,966 --> 00:47:05,166
Meiying.

775
00:47:05,733 --> 00:47:06,734
Meiying?

776
00:47:08,436 --> 00:47:10,304
- Meiying.
- Mama.

777
00:47:12,773 --> 00:47:14,774
Are you okay?

778
00:47:14,776 --> 00:47:18,912
There's a monster
and it's watching us.

779
00:47:38,566 --> 00:47:40,434
It's okay.
It's just a whale.

780
00:47:41,602 --> 00:47:43,337
Wait. Where's Lucy?

781
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,973
Where's the mom?

782
00:47:59,654 --> 00:48:02,588
Is the station all right?
Report.

783
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:04,289
No leaks. No visible damage.

784
00:48:04,291 --> 00:48:07,192
All right, team.
Initiate emergency protocols.

785
00:48:07,194 --> 00:48:08,661
And nobody is to go
near the water.

786
00:48:08,663 --> 00:48:09,662
If you insist.

787
00:48:09,664 --> 00:48:11,497
Turn off
all the underwater lighting.

788
00:48:11,499 --> 00:48:13,532
Restrict the crew
to essential areas.

789
00:48:13,534 --> 00:48:16,168
You said it was impossible
for it to get up here.

790
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:17,736
It should have been.

791
00:48:17,738 --> 00:48:19,538
You guys,
take a look at this.

792
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:21,875
When the glider came up,
the thermocline was intact,

793
00:48:21,877 --> 00:48:24,010
so it was
one degree Celsius, right?

794
00:48:24,012 --> 00:48:25,544
Yeah.

795
00:48:25,546 --> 00:48:27,713
But a minute later,
when the <i>Evolution</i> came up,

796
00:48:27,715 --> 00:48:29,816
the temperature increased
by 25 degrees.

797
00:48:29,818 --> 00:48:32,184
A shark could come
right through there.

798
00:48:32,186 --> 00:48:34,420
20 sharks for that matter.

799
00:48:34,422 --> 00:48:35,621
When the meg hit the <i>Origin,</i>

800
00:48:35,623 --> 00:48:37,090
it slammed into
a thermal vent.

801
00:48:37,092 --> 00:48:39,658
Those can release millions
of gallons per minute.

802
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:41,727
The heat from that vent
cleared the path

803
00:48:41,729 --> 00:48:43,462
through the freezing
cold layer.

804
00:48:43,464 --> 00:48:44,663
Are you saying we opened up

805
00:48:44,665 --> 00:48:46,166
a super highway
for giant sharks?

806
00:48:46,168 --> 00:48:49,334
Not exactly. It seems like
it was a transitory event.

807
00:48:49,336 --> 00:48:50,569
The temperatures
are returned to normal

808
00:48:50,571 --> 00:48:52,204
and the gap is closed.

809
00:48:52,206 --> 00:48:55,374
Yeah. But not before a massive
prehistoric killing machine

810
00:48:55,376 --> 00:48:56,876
decided to come up
and say "Hi."

811
00:48:56,878 --> 00:48:59,278
Hey, look, we're wasting time.
That thing's out there.

812
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,748
We need to find it
and kill it.

813
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:02,681
No.

814
00:49:02,683 --> 00:49:07,153
We can't. We should explore
non-lethal options first.

815
00:49:07,155 --> 00:49:08,922
For the meg or for us?

816
00:49:10,658 --> 00:49:11,858
<i>Attention.</i>

817
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:14,226
I've got
an emergency locator beacon.

818
00:49:14,228 --> 00:49:15,895
20 miles south, southwest.

819
00:49:15,897 --> 00:49:17,097
What does that mean?

820
00:49:17,099 --> 00:49:18,597
It means
a boat has gone down.

821
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:20,432
- <i>Attention.</i>
- Three boats.

822
00:49:20,434 --> 00:49:24,338
That's the meg.
We need to get there. Now.

823
00:49:39,253 --> 00:49:41,890
Mac! I found something!

824
00:50:00,341 --> 00:50:02,175
These sharks have no fins.

825
00:50:02,177 --> 00:50:04,643
They were killed
by shark poachers.

826
00:50:04,645 --> 00:50:07,515
They cut off the fins and
throw the shark back to die.

827
00:50:08,582 --> 00:50:11,350
All for a bowl of soup.

828
00:50:11,352 --> 00:50:13,021
Looks like the meg
evened the score.

829
00:50:18,325 --> 00:50:19,760
One fish did all this?

830
00:50:20,996 --> 00:50:22,496
Ask it yourself.

831
00:50:25,366 --> 00:50:26,765
Okay.

832
00:50:26,767 --> 00:50:29,401
We have a shark cage
and spearguns on board.

833
00:50:29,403 --> 00:50:31,037
If we can shoot the meg

834
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:32,806
in a soft spot
like it's mouth or gills,

835
00:50:32,808 --> 00:50:34,908
we can inject it
with something lethal.

836
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:36,176
Whoa! Whoa, whoa.

837
00:50:36,178 --> 00:50:37,911
It's gonna take at least
20 minutes to rig the cage.

838
00:50:37,913 --> 00:50:39,611
And that thing
will be gone in two.

839
00:50:39,613 --> 00:50:41,348
Why don't you just
put a tracker on it?

840
00:50:43,684 --> 00:50:45,350
Don't you guys
ever watch <i>Shark Week?</i>

841
00:50:45,352 --> 00:50:50,156
You have one of those, like,
GPS tracker tag thingamajigs.

842
00:50:50,158 --> 00:50:52,125
Keep an eye on the shark
till the cage is ready.

843
00:50:52,127 --> 00:50:54,093
We should be able
to put a tracking dart

844
00:50:54,095 --> 00:50:55,228
in that dorsal fin.

845
00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:56,328
You're welcome.

846
00:50:56,330 --> 00:50:57,964
Yeah, but somehow

847
00:50:57,966 --> 00:50:59,531
we have to get this boat
next to that meg.

848
00:50:59,533 --> 00:51:01,201
No, we can't.

849
00:51:01,203 --> 00:51:03,937
It's already proven
aggressive towards boats.

850
00:51:03,939 --> 00:51:06,272
The safest way to approach
is without a vehicle.

851
00:51:06,274 --> 00:51:07,439
Hold up. Hold up.

852
00:51:07,441 --> 00:51:08,942
You want someone
to swim out there?

853
00:51:08,944 --> 00:51:11,610
To a prehistoric shark
that ate our friend?

854
00:51:11,612 --> 00:51:14,080
Actually, one of us alone
in the water is no threat.

855
00:51:14,082 --> 00:51:16,717
Okay, who the hell
is gonna make that swim?

856
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,153
Let's draw straws.

857
00:51:20,155 --> 00:51:21,722
I can't swim.

858
00:51:24,358 --> 00:51:25,591
Uh...

859
00:51:25,593 --> 00:51:28,662
Sorry, my body
made me say that.

860
00:51:29,998 --> 00:51:31,933
You sure about this?

861
00:51:34,336 --> 00:51:37,136
Not really.

862
00:51:37,138 --> 00:51:39,841
If I get eaten,
you're gonna feel really bad.

863
00:51:45,814 --> 00:51:49,084
This tracker rifle
only has a 100-foot range.

864
00:51:49,818 --> 00:51:50,950
100 feet?

865
00:51:50,952 --> 00:51:52,854
Get really close
before you shoot.

866
00:51:53,855 --> 00:51:55,420
Great.

867
00:51:55,422 --> 00:51:57,522
If you want me
to go instead, I will.

868
00:51:57,524 --> 00:51:59,359
I got this, Mac.

869
00:51:59,361 --> 00:52:01,160
Okay, good,
'cause I was lying.

870
00:52:01,162 --> 00:52:02,461
Be safe.

871
00:52:02,463 --> 00:52:03,965
Yeah, thanks, pal.

872
00:52:07,035 --> 00:52:09,004
I hope you're right
about this.

873
00:52:09,938 --> 00:52:11,172
Me, too.

874
00:52:23,151 --> 00:52:24,853
I'm an idiot.

875
00:52:36,697 --> 00:52:40,366
I am proceeding to
the enormous killer shark.

876
00:52:40,368 --> 00:52:42,135
Yeah, we got you, Jonas.

00:55:36,277 --> 00:55:37,609
Good job.

899
00:55:52,927 --> 00:55:56,796
I prepared the spearheads
to inject etorphine.

900
00:55:56,798 --> 00:55:59,664
A killer whale is knocked
out with 10 CCs.

901
00:55:59,666 --> 00:56:02,301
Dead with 20.
What do you think?

902
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:05,039
I think we use
the whole damn bottle.

903
00:56:06,441 --> 00:56:09,708
Remind me again
why this is a good idea.

904
00:56:09,710 --> 00:56:11,978
What?
It's a shark cage.

905
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:13,980
Plastic shark cage.

906
00:56:13,982 --> 00:56:16,449
I'm gonna ignore
that you just said that.

907
00:56:16,451 --> 00:56:18,885
This beautiful thing
is polycarbonate,

908
00:56:18,887 --> 00:56:21,521
specifically designed
not to crack,

909
00:56:21,523 --> 00:56:24,056
not to break, but to deform.

910
00:56:24,058 --> 00:56:26,025
And in this case,
at this thickness,

911
00:56:26,027 --> 00:56:29,896
it would take 20,000 pounds
per square inch.

912
00:56:29,898 --> 00:56:31,898
And if you're talking
about breaking,

913
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:34,435
that's eight to nine
hundred thousand.

914
00:56:37,906 --> 00:56:39,307
I don't like it.

915
00:56:43,645 --> 00:56:45,311
Doesn't like it.

916
00:56:45,313 --> 00:56:47,015
I wouldn't get in there.

917
00:56:48,850 --> 00:56:50,084
Keep it coming.

918
00:56:54,155 --> 00:56:55,823
That's good!

919
00:57:03,431 --> 00:57:04,465
Hey.

920
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:07,800
What did he say?

921
00:57:07,802 --> 00:57:09,635
He said, "be careful."

922
00:57:09,637 --> 00:57:11,938
That's his version
of I love you.

923
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:13,738
Your father has
a lot of faith in you.

924
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:16,911
I've done
hundreds of shark dives.

925
00:57:18,546 --> 00:57:20,714
Not like this.

926
00:57:21,249 --> 00:57:22,383
Yes.

927
00:57:23,084 --> 00:57:25,117
But I know shark anatomy.

928
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:26,751
And I know where this

929
00:57:26,753 --> 00:57:29,424
can penetrate through
megalodon skin.

930
00:57:31,993 --> 00:57:34,527
- Suyin, let me go instead...
- Hey.

931
00:57:34,529 --> 00:57:37,465
Don't worry about me.
Let me do what I do best.

932
00:58:23,911 --> 00:58:25,478
<i>Everything okay up there?</i>

933
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:28,114
<i>Just a fresh
round of chum,</i>

934
00:58:28,116 --> 00:58:31,117
so you,
you know, taste good.

935
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:33,786
<i>I'm so glad
you're looking out for me.</i>

936
00:58:33,788 --> 00:58:36,291
Thank you.
Bye-bye. Good luck.

937
00:59:02,417 --> 00:59:03,916
<i>What's happening
down there?</i>

938
00:59:03,918 --> 00:59:05,484
<i>You okay?</i>

939
00:59:05,486 --> 00:59:07,553
<i>Yeah. I'm okay.</i>

940
00:59:07,555 --> 00:59:11,125
<i>Just some teeny,
tiny eight-foot sharks.</i>

941
00:59:17,965 --> 00:59:20,399
<i>Here we go.</i>

942
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:23,502
We've got her attention.

943
00:59:23,504 --> 00:59:25,304
Suyin, it's on its way.

944
00:59:25,306 --> 00:59:26,874
- 50 meters.
- 50 meters.

945
00:59:29,844 --> 00:59:31,112
<i>30.</i>

946
00:59:32,914 --> 00:59:34,013
<i>10 meters.</i>

947
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:53,301
<i>Okay.</i>

948
00:59:54,803 --> 00:59:57,103
<i>Wow.</i>

949
00:59:57,105 --> 00:59:59,507
<i>I'm going to try
to hit it in the eye.</i>

950
01:00:01,844 --> 01:00:03,378
<i>Damn it.</i>

951
01:00:15,156 --> 01:00:16,722
Whoa! Watch it.

952
01:00:16,724 --> 01:00:18,025
Whoa! Hey!

953
01:00:28,369 --> 01:00:30,304
Oh, sh...

954
01:00:38,312 --> 01:00:40,847
<i>Yes!
The poison is in.</i>

955
01:00:40,849 --> 01:00:43,317
<i>Okay, Suyin,
hang in there.</i>

956
01:00:46,621 --> 01:00:49,121
<i>I'm trapped!
I'm in its mouth!</i>

957
01:00:49,123 --> 01:00:50,756
That cage will not break.

958
01:00:50,758 --> 01:00:54,128
<i>That's the problem.
The cage is being swallowed.</i>

959
01:01:07,843 --> 01:01:09,375
Hell, yeah!

960
01:01:19,987 --> 01:01:22,390
- Not this again.
- Oh, man. Oh, man.

961
01:01:48,851 --> 01:01:52,987
<i>New problem. My mask
is broken. I'm losing air.</i>

962
01:02:00,061 --> 01:02:01,596
Help!

963
01:02:04,999 --> 01:02:06,200
Help!

964
01:02:11,272 --> 01:02:13,074
Come on, Jaxx!

965
01:02:17,512 --> 01:02:20,047
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

966
01:02:25,553 --> 01:02:26,887
<i>No, Jonas.</i>

967
01:02:26,889 --> 01:02:29,190
<i>Go! Get back to the ship.</i>

968
01:02:29,958 --> 01:02:31,659
<i>It's not safe for you.</i>

969
01:02:34,262 --> 01:02:36,564
<i>Jonas, go back.</i>

970
01:02:37,565 --> 01:02:38,666
<i>Jonas.</i>

971
01:02:48,676 --> 01:02:50,911
<i>Jonas,
the crane's in the water!</i>

972
01:02:50,913 --> 01:02:53,214
<i>It's gonna pull her
to the bottom. Hurry!</i>

973
01:02:56,852 --> 01:02:58,785
Swing the second crane over.

974
01:02:58,787 --> 01:03:01,556
We're gonna set a trap.
Guys, I need some bait.

975
01:03:23,678 --> 01:03:25,144
Come on. Got him!

976
01:03:25,146 --> 01:03:26,681
Whoa!

977
01:04:15,396 --> 01:04:17,231
Over here!

978
01:04:19,266 --> 01:04:21,903
This way. Throw a rope.

979
01:04:23,071 --> 01:04:24,472
She's not breathing.

980
01:05:09,851 --> 01:05:11,051
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

981
01:05:11,053 --> 01:05:12,518
Take it easy.

982
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:13,855
You were dead a minute ago.

983
01:05:14,588 --> 01:05:15,924
Doctor.

984
01:05:19,928 --> 01:05:22,494
You got me out.

985
01:05:22,496 --> 01:05:24,498
It was closer
than I woulda liked.

986
01:05:25,967 --> 01:05:28,736
Can I have
a minute with Jonas?

987
01:05:30,005 --> 01:05:31,338
Sure.

988
01:05:44,218 --> 01:05:47,388
You saved me. Again.

989
01:05:48,322 --> 01:05:49,925
I prefer you alive.

990
01:05:53,761 --> 01:05:56,230
There's something
you might wanna see.

991
01:05:57,565 --> 01:05:59,264
Wow.

992
01:05:59,266 --> 01:06:00,501
Wow.

993
01:06:10,244 --> 01:06:12,578
- Hey! Look who's up.
- Hey.

994
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:15,649
- How are ya?
- I'm better. Thank you.

995
01:06:16,650 --> 01:06:18,450
Jonas, get a picture of me

996
01:06:18,452 --> 01:06:20,285
with this big smelly beast.

997
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:22,621
Okay. Wait. Here.

998
01:06:22,623 --> 01:06:23,890
Hey, you want
a proper picture,

999
01:06:23,892 --> 01:06:25,359
get your head inside.

1000
01:06:26,061 --> 01:06:27,326
- Closer.
- Closer?

1001
01:06:27,328 --> 01:06:28,727
Come on. Get in.

1002
01:06:28,729 --> 01:06:29,595
Okay.

1003
01:06:29,597 --> 01:06:31,732
Ugh!

1004
01:06:36,370 --> 01:06:37,636
Nice one.

1005
01:06:37,638 --> 01:06:40,305
Yo, Jonas, please tell me
you got that.

1006
01:06:40,307 --> 01:06:42,010
I got that, DJ.

1007
01:06:43,044 --> 01:06:44,376
That's not funny, man!

1008
01:06:44,378 --> 01:06:45,577
No, like seriously,
it's funny.

1009
01:06:45,579 --> 01:06:47,581
Look. Watch this.

1010
01:06:49,450 --> 01:06:51,750
<i>♪ We got The Wall
in the water</i>

1011
01:06:51,752 --> 01:06:53,452
<i>♪ We got The Wall
in the water ♪</i>

1012
01:06:54,755 --> 01:06:56,055
<i>♪ We got The Wall
in the water ♪</i>

1013
01:06:56,057 --> 01:06:57,558
Hey, Suyin.

1014
01:06:58,692 --> 01:07:00,461
Look at him next to the meg.

1015
01:07:01,695 --> 01:07:05,697
Look, remember the bite marks
on the O-Level?

1016
01:07:05,699 --> 01:07:07,499
Well, how do you like that?

1017
01:07:07,501 --> 01:07:10,369
That was a serious
man vs. nature moment.

1018
01:07:10,371 --> 01:07:12,640
I'm just glad
things went our way.

1019
01:07:13,507 --> 01:07:15,409
It didn't go our way.

1020
01:07:16,410 --> 01:07:17,946
Not for Toshi.

1021
01:07:19,281 --> 01:07:21,482
And not for science.

1022
01:07:22,483 --> 01:07:25,118
We did what people always do.

1023
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:28,790
Discover and then destroy.

1024
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:32,926
Ugh.

1025
01:07:32,928 --> 01:07:34,560
Hey, I will end you.

1026
01:07:34,562 --> 01:07:36,328
At least you can use this
as your dating app pic.

1027
01:07:36,330 --> 01:07:37,831
Give you a little leg,
you know.

1028
01:07:37,833 --> 01:07:38,965
Yeah!

1029
01:07:38,967 --> 01:07:40,766
Oh, yeah!

1030
01:07:40,768 --> 01:07:42,369
- Jellyfish.
- Whoo-hoo!

1031
01:08:22,576 --> 01:08:24,777
Two! There's two?

1032
01:08:24,779 --> 01:08:26,480
Nobody said there were two.

1033
01:08:27,349 --> 01:08:29,315
How are there two?

1034
01:08:29,317 --> 01:08:30,716
Help me!
Get me out of this water!

1035
01:08:30,718 --> 01:08:33,152
Help! Somebody help, please!

1036
01:08:33,154 --> 01:08:34,586
Help!

1037
01:08:34,588 --> 01:08:36,055
What is wrong with you?

1038
01:08:36,057 --> 01:08:38,224
I can't... I can't swim.

1039
01:08:38,226 --> 01:08:40,126
No! Get outta here! Really?

1040
01:08:40,128 --> 01:08:41,895
Don't pull that
racist stuff on me.

1041
01:08:41,897 --> 01:08:42,929
Oh, come on, man.

1042
01:08:42,931 --> 01:08:44,596
Give me a break.
I'm not being racist.

1043
01:08:44,598 --> 01:08:48,968
You work, literally,
in the middle of the ocean.

1044
01:08:48,970 --> 01:08:50,870
This wasn't
part of the job description.

1045
01:08:50,872 --> 01:08:53,339
None of this was part
of the job description!

1046
01:08:53,341 --> 01:08:54,976
They left that part out!

1047
01:09:06,453 --> 01:09:07,719
It's time
to get some real help.

1048
01:09:07,721 --> 01:09:09,421
Yeah. Go get some help.

1049
01:09:12,027 --> 01:09:13,326
I'm quitting.

1050
01:09:13,328 --> 01:09:15,830
Mac! Give me a hand.

1051
01:09:20,701 --> 01:09:23,803
Hey, I need you
to find my location.

1052
01:09:23,805 --> 01:09:26,339
Track my sat phone.
There's a second shark.

1053
01:09:26,341 --> 01:09:27,907
Yes, two.

1054
01:09:27,909 --> 01:09:29,541
How the hell should I know?

1055
01:09:29,543 --> 01:09:31,643
Just hurry up
and get us some help.

1056
01:09:31,645 --> 01:09:32,779
Thank you, Jonas. Thank you.

1057
01:09:32,781 --> 01:09:34,047
Bring whatever
you got!

1058
01:09:34,049 --> 01:09:36,182
Just relax. Relax.

1059
01:09:36,184 --> 01:09:37,749
It's not good.

1060
01:09:37,751 --> 01:09:39,618
He needs a hospital fast.

1061
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:42,055
Let's get the doctor.
Where's Doctor Heller?

1062
01:09:43,457 --> 01:09:44,658
Jaxx?

1063
01:09:45,427 --> 01:09:47,427
Jaxx, you okay?

1064
01:09:47,429 --> 01:09:49,663
Yeah! Kind of.

1065
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:53,632
Jaxx...

1066
01:09:53,634 --> 01:09:55,467
We can do this.

1067
01:09:55,469 --> 01:09:57,138
Swim gently back to the boat.

1068
01:09:57,738 --> 01:09:59,640
Nice and easy.

1069
01:10:04,712 --> 01:10:06,446
Here it comes!

1070
01:10:06,448 --> 01:10:07,715
Heller!

1071
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:10,018
We're not gonna make it.

1072
01:10:11,386 --> 01:10:12,684
Jaxx.

1073
01:10:12,686 --> 01:10:14,087
You're gonna be okay.

1074
01:10:14,089 --> 01:10:16,992
- You're a good person, Jaxx.
- Wait, what?

1075
01:10:17,691 --> 01:10:19,158
Don't look back.

1076
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:20,559
- Hey!
- No!

1077
01:10:20,561 --> 01:10:21,660
Heller, no!

1078
01:10:21,662 --> 01:10:23,096
- What are you doing?
- Hey!

1079
01:10:23,098 --> 01:10:24,831
Hey, come on!

1080
01:10:24,833 --> 01:10:27,902
Hey! Hey, come on!

1081
01:10:28,502 --> 01:10:29,703
Hey!

1082
01:10:32,207 --> 01:10:34,042
Heller!

1083
01:10:43,318 --> 01:10:45,550
Almost there.

1084
01:10:45,552 --> 01:10:47,989
- Come on.
- We got you.

1085
01:10:50,724 --> 01:10:53,625
It's okay, Jaxx.

1086
01:10:53,627 --> 01:10:55,196
You're gonna be okay.

1087
01:11:02,536 --> 01:11:07,140
Thank you, Heller, thank you.

1088
01:11:07,142 --> 01:11:09,809
What was that?
What the hell was that?

1089
01:11:09,811 --> 01:11:11,978
- Okay, come on, DJ.
- No! No!

1090
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:13,946
This is why we don't
leave the station, okay?

1091
01:11:13,948 --> 01:11:15,782
That's why you don't do that!

1092
01:11:15,784 --> 01:11:18,184
And you went down there
and you pissed it off,

1093
01:11:18,186 --> 01:11:20,953
now it's gonna come back
and kill every one of us!

1094
01:11:20,955 --> 01:11:22,422
Now what are we
supposed to do?

1095
01:11:22,424 --> 01:11:24,157
I shouldn't even be out here
in the first place.

1096
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:27,026
Swimming in this ocean.
That one ate the other one.

1097
01:11:27,028 --> 01:11:29,095
Is another one
gonna eat this one?

1098
01:11:29,097 --> 01:11:30,999
Man, it's...

1099
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,100
It just killed Heller.

1100
01:11:34,102 --> 01:11:37,238
It killed The Wall.
It killed Toshi.

1101
01:11:39,606 --> 01:11:41,810
These are my friends, man.

1102
01:11:50,717 --> 01:11:51,918
Okay,
can I just point out

1103
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:53,319
that this thing is sinking?

1104
01:11:53,321 --> 01:11:54,619
What are we gonna do now?

1105
01:11:54,621 --> 01:11:55,857
Where's Mac?

1106
01:12:10,972 --> 01:12:11,973
Yes!

1107
01:12:26,488 --> 01:12:28,454
What happened to your hair?

1108
01:12:28,456 --> 01:12:29,791
What happened to your hair?

1109
01:12:30,657 --> 01:12:31,926
Touche.

1110
01:12:33,660 --> 01:12:34,896
Guys!

1111
01:12:37,664 --> 01:12:39,067
That thing is the devil.

1112
01:12:40,101 --> 01:12:42,301
10 miles, it's still with us.

1113
01:12:42,303 --> 01:12:43,970
You got us?

1114
01:12:43,972 --> 01:12:46,139
The ocean. The middle
of a freaking ocean!

1115
01:12:46,141 --> 01:12:47,607
Do you think
it'd slow down the shark

1116
01:12:47,609 --> 01:12:49,944
if we threw him over?

1117
01:12:51,012 --> 01:12:53,479
You got to work on yourself.

1118
01:12:53,481 --> 01:12:54,713
Okay. Good news, guys.

1119
01:12:54,715 --> 01:12:56,151
It's payback time.

1120
01:12:57,785 --> 01:12:59,753
Oh, yeah!

1121
01:13:32,187 --> 01:13:33,619
Yes! Get some!

1122
01:13:33,621 --> 01:13:35,354
You seriously think
that a rifle

1123
01:13:35,356 --> 01:13:36,355
is gonna hurt that thing?

1124
01:13:36,357 --> 01:13:38,257
I didn't have
much notice, okay?

1125
01:13:38,259 --> 01:13:40,795
I just wanted to get it
off our backs.

1126
01:13:41,596 --> 01:13:42,795
Well done, Morris.

1127
01:13:42,797 --> 01:13:44,098
Whoo!

1128
01:15:33,975 --> 01:15:35,107
It's okay.

1129
01:15:35,109 --> 01:15:37,478
Mummy! Mummy!

1130
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:40,882
Welcome back, Mummy.

1131
01:16:29,832 --> 01:16:31,132
Come in.

1132
01:16:37,038 --> 01:16:38,473
How's Meiying?

1133
01:16:39,941 --> 01:16:41,874
She's sad.

1134
01:16:41,876 --> 01:16:44,245
And confused.

1135
01:16:45,580 --> 01:16:47,048
How are you?

1136
01:16:48,851 --> 01:16:51,619
I really don't want
to accept it.

1137
01:16:54,355 --> 01:16:59,158
Sometimes things happen
that change your life forever.

1138
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:01,795
Meanwhile,
the world just keeps going.

1139
01:17:01,797 --> 01:17:06,200
You think maybe it would stop
just for a second...

1140
01:17:08,703 --> 01:17:10,569
But it doesn't.

1141
01:17:10,571 --> 01:17:12,440
How do you live with it?

1142
01:17:13,842 --> 01:17:15,076
I don't.

1143
01:17:16,043 --> 01:17:19,745
I left my two best friends
to die.

1144
01:17:19,747 --> 01:17:22,648
I think about it
all the time.

1145
01:17:22,650 --> 01:17:24,452
Every day I replay it.

1146
01:17:25,686 --> 01:17:28,354
Could I have done more?

1147
01:17:28,356 --> 01:17:31,392
It's not just about
the ones you lose.

1148
01:17:33,294 --> 01:17:37,365
It's also about
the ones you save.

1149
01:17:42,603 --> 01:17:44,405
I'm glad you're here.

1150
01:17:56,551 --> 01:17:59,518
I've informed the Chinese
government about the meg.

1151
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:02,321
As well as the authorities
in Thailand,

1152
01:18:02,323 --> 01:18:04,623
Vietnam, Indonesia,
and Australia.

1153
01:18:04,625 --> 01:18:08,795
The Chinese are sending
two destroyers to take it out.

1154
01:18:08,797 --> 01:18:11,230
So, this is now officially

1155
01:18:11,232 --> 01:18:14,001
and thankfully
out of our hands.

1156
01:18:16,704 --> 01:18:18,306
I'm closing <i>Mana One</i>

1157
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:21,607
until the meg is killed

1158
01:18:21,609 --> 01:18:25,978
and an evacuation ship is
coming here tomorrow morning.

1159
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:27,546
You damn right.

1160
01:18:27,548 --> 01:18:30,351
And finally,
I just want to say

1161
01:18:34,957 --> 01:18:38,659
I'm sorry for your losses.

1162
01:18:39,828 --> 01:18:41,629
Your friends.

1163
01:18:43,397 --> 01:18:46,067
I came here
to celebrate with you,

1164
01:18:48,436 --> 01:18:50,571
and now I'm mourning with you.

1165
01:19:04,485 --> 01:19:06,387
Thanks for saving our asses.

1166
01:19:15,730 --> 01:19:17,663
What do you got for me?

1167
01:19:17,665 --> 01:19:20,666
These are Semtex high velocity
demolition charges.

1168
01:19:20,668 --> 01:19:23,769
I had the men rig delay fuses
to give them time to sink.

1169
01:19:23,771 --> 01:19:26,340
Essentially,
they're depth charges.

1170
01:19:28,175 --> 01:19:29,708
That's right.

1171
01:19:29,710 --> 01:19:33,045
I'm not sure this is
a advisable course of action.

1172
01:19:33,047 --> 01:19:36,415
Every person that gets maimed
or killed by that thing

1173
01:19:36,417 --> 01:19:37,817
is a potential lawsuit.

1174
01:19:37,819 --> 01:19:39,320
A potential casualty.

1175
01:19:40,688 --> 01:19:43,556
Relax, bro.
It's gonna be fun.

1176
01:19:47,194 --> 01:19:50,563
- I can see your cards.
- Well, look at you two crooks.

1177
01:19:50,565 --> 01:19:51,798
Hey.

1178
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:53,732
How are you feeling?

1179
01:19:53,734 --> 01:19:54,767
Like I got off easy,

1180
01:19:54,769 --> 01:19:56,237
compared to
the rest of you guys.

1181
01:19:56,872 --> 01:19:58,105
Mmm.

1182
01:19:58,807 --> 01:20:00,272
What do you got up there?

1183
01:20:00,274 --> 01:20:01,473
Three kings.

1184
01:20:01,475 --> 01:20:04,743
What? Come on! Every time.

1185
01:20:04,745 --> 01:20:06,913
You owe me
a soda for that one.

1186
01:20:06,915 --> 01:20:08,714
Fine.

1187
01:20:08,716 --> 01:20:10,850
We'll square up
when you get back, okay?

1188
01:20:10,852 --> 01:20:13,619
Fine. Fine. Fine.

1189
01:20:13,621 --> 01:20:15,654
Just trying to take her mind
off things, you know.

1190
01:20:15,656 --> 01:20:17,692
She's tougher than me,
that's for sure.

1191
01:20:21,562 --> 01:20:23,629
I'm sorry
I didn't believe you.

1192
01:20:23,631 --> 01:20:26,165
Well, you didn't
call me crazy.

1193
01:20:26,167 --> 01:20:27,968
Yeah, but I didn't
call you sane.

1194
01:20:27,970 --> 01:20:31,272
Yeah, well, "sane" wasn't
a word I heard very often.

1195
01:20:33,274 --> 01:20:34,941
So, what now?

1196
01:20:34,943 --> 01:20:37,676
I don't know.
Go back to Thailand, I guess.

1197
01:20:37,678 --> 01:20:39,745
Mac told me
about you and Suyin.

1198
01:20:39,747 --> 01:20:43,582
- Nothing to tell.
- Well, maybe there could be.

1199
01:20:43,584 --> 01:20:44,884
You and Mac are unbelievable.

1200
01:20:44,886 --> 01:20:47,854
How about you just
try something new?

1201
01:20:47,856 --> 01:20:50,189
So the rest of your life
isn't a vast wasteland

1202
01:20:50,191 --> 01:20:52,959
of misery and solitude.

1203
01:20:52,961 --> 01:20:55,361
I think that's a good idea.

1204
01:20:55,363 --> 01:20:56,695
You do, huh?

1205
01:20:56,697 --> 01:20:58,564
Eight-year-olds
hear everything.

1206
01:20:58,566 --> 01:21:00,768
Jonas...

1207
01:21:04,372 --> 01:21:06,707
My mom likes you, too.

1208
01:21:11,278 --> 01:21:14,415
This is possibly
the worst moment of my life.

1209
01:21:17,351 --> 01:21:18,985
<i>Approaching target area.</i>

1210
01:21:18,987 --> 01:21:20,388
<i>I'll confirm visual.</i>

1211
01:21:22,623 --> 01:21:24,858
Let me make myself
absolutely clear.

1212
01:21:24,860 --> 01:21:27,493
We are not getting within
a mile of that monster

1213
01:21:27,495 --> 01:21:29,528
until the helicopter kills it.

1214
01:21:29,530 --> 01:21:31,664
<i>We have a visual
on the target.</i>

1215
01:21:31,666 --> 01:21:33,198
Stop the boat.

1216
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:34,402
Stop the boat.

1217
01:21:37,304 --> 01:21:39,240
<i>Deploying
depth charges.</i>

1218
01:21:53,187 --> 01:21:54,455
We got him.

1219
01:21:56,058 --> 01:21:57,389
Hit it again.

1220
01:21:57,391 --> 01:21:58,457
<i>Sir,
there's no way possible...</i>

1221
01:21:58,459 --> 01:21:59,660
Hit it again.

1222
01:22:06,134 --> 01:22:09,401
<i>Target is dead.
Repeat, target is dead.</i>

1223
01:22:09,403 --> 01:22:11,004
Are you absolutely sure?

1224
01:22:11,006 --> 01:22:12,172
Because I'm not getting eaten

1225
01:22:12,174 --> 01:22:13,907
by some goddamn
prehistoric fish.

1226
01:22:13,909 --> 01:22:16,475
<i>Affirmative, sir.
There's, uh...</i>

1227
01:22:16,477 --> 01:22:19,244
Well, there's pieces of it
all over the place.

1228
01:22:19,246 --> 01:22:21,346
<i>Shark chunks?</i>

1229
01:22:21,348 --> 01:22:23,049
That's a good sign.

1230
01:22:23,051 --> 01:22:25,821
All right. Take us in.

1231
01:22:33,260 --> 01:22:34,794
Oh!

1232
01:22:34,796 --> 01:22:36,863
Jump down there,
get me a couple of teeth.

1233
01:22:36,865 --> 01:22:37,931
Big ones for my desk.

1234
01:22:37,933 --> 01:22:40,001
- All right.
- Keep one for yourself.

1235
01:22:40,969 --> 01:22:42,570
Nice.

1236
01:22:45,539 --> 01:22:47,008
Oh, you seeing this?

1237
01:22:48,409 --> 01:22:49,643
Crazy.

1238
01:22:54,850 --> 01:22:56,650
That's sick.

1239
01:23:01,990 --> 01:23:03,357
That's weird.

1240
01:23:08,696 --> 01:23:11,430
Oh, man!
Don't do that to me.

1241
01:23:11,432 --> 01:23:13,332
That thing
doesn't have any teeth.

1242
01:23:13,334 --> 01:23:14,968
What?

1243
01:23:14,970 --> 01:23:16,537
I think we killed a whale.

1244
01:23:19,607 --> 01:23:21,408
It's right below us.

1245
01:23:22,309 --> 01:23:23,577
Get us outta here!

1246
01:23:28,649 --> 01:23:31,117
Wait! Wait,
you idiots! Wait!

1247
01:23:31,119 --> 01:23:33,054
I'm over here! Wait!

1248
01:23:35,456 --> 01:23:37,758
Oh, no!

1249
01:23:58,246 --> 01:23:59,547
Oh!

1250
01:24:11,725 --> 01:24:15,329
Yeah, I understand.
I understand, yep. Thank you.

1251
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:19,565
Let me guess,
Morris never called anyone.

1252
01:24:19,567 --> 01:24:20,834
Didn't call anyone.

1253
01:24:20,836 --> 01:24:22,501
No one knows
the shark's out there.

1254
01:24:22,503 --> 01:24:24,304
No one. Not the Australians,

1255
01:24:24,306 --> 01:24:25,637
not the Chinese. No one.

1256
01:24:25,639 --> 01:24:27,140
The hell was he thinking?

1257
01:24:27,142 --> 01:24:29,575
He wanted to make this go away
as quietly as possible.

1258
01:24:29,577 --> 01:24:30,742
Mac, we need
to let everyone...

1259
01:24:30,744 --> 01:24:32,145
Let everyone know.
Yeah, I'm on it.

1260
01:24:32,147 --> 01:24:33,645
Jaxx, can you find that thing?

1261
01:24:33,647 --> 01:24:35,281
Wait, wait, wait.
Why're you asking her that?

1262
01:24:35,283 --> 01:24:37,551
I don't like the fact that you
asking her about that thing.

1263
01:24:38,552 --> 01:24:39,919
You want me
to illegally hack

1264
01:24:39,921 --> 01:24:41,720
into Morris' satellite
tracking system

1265
01:24:41,722 --> 01:24:44,257
- to find a prehistoric shark?
- Yeah.

1266
01:24:44,259 --> 01:24:45,757
Okay.

1267
01:24:45,759 --> 01:24:48,194
We use a tracker,
find the meg, and we kill it.

1268
01:24:48,196 --> 01:24:49,396
Bro.

1269
01:24:51,432 --> 01:24:52,832
We really gonna do this?

1270
01:24:52,834 --> 01:24:54,733
A lot of people are gonna die
if we don't, Mac.

1271
01:24:54,735 --> 01:24:56,236
- Well, I'm in.
- Me, too.

1272
01:24:56,238 --> 01:24:58,004
Let's do this.

1273
01:24:58,006 --> 01:25:00,439
How do you feel about
commandeering that evac ship?

1274
01:25:00,441 --> 01:25:02,608
I'd say,

1275
01:25:02,610 --> 01:25:04,445
it's a great day
to go fishing.

1276
01:25:05,579 --> 01:25:06,779
Now let's get
everything on it.

1277
01:25:06,781 --> 01:25:08,747
Construction explosives,
gliders.

1278
01:25:08,749 --> 01:25:10,149
The whole lot. Everything.

1279
01:25:10,151 --> 01:25:12,185
Because we're about
to evac, right?

1280
01:25:12,187 --> 01:25:13,485
Like evacuate?

1281
01:25:13,487 --> 01:25:15,654
Like, leave the area
of imminent danger

1282
01:25:15,656 --> 01:25:19,627
and go to a safe place
like normal people?

1283
01:25:30,272 --> 01:25:31,703
What we got, Jaxx?
Anything?

1284
01:25:31,705 --> 01:25:34,406
Yeah. Here's where we saw
Morris attack the shark.

1285
01:25:34,408 --> 01:25:37,076
But here is where it's going.

1286
01:25:37,078 --> 01:25:38,543
Sanya Bay. What's there?

1287
01:25:38,545 --> 01:25:39,678
Oh, nothing.

1288
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:40,980
It only has some of the most

1289
01:25:40,982 --> 01:25:42,949
densely populated beaches
in the world.

1290
01:25:42,951 --> 01:25:44,350
Any luck with the authorities?

1291
01:25:44,352 --> 01:25:45,785
No.

1292
01:25:45,787 --> 01:25:48,187
"Prehistoric shark" sounds
like a damn prank call.

1293
01:25:48,189 --> 01:25:50,223
We can't rely on them
for anything.

1294
01:25:50,225 --> 01:25:52,225
How long until the
shark gets to those people?

1295
01:25:52,227 --> 01:25:53,425
20 minutes.

1296
01:25:53,427 --> 01:25:55,228
- Can we get there first?
- Doubtful.

1297
01:25:55,230 --> 01:25:56,561
Yeah, we're gonna have to.

1298
01:25:56,563 --> 01:25:57,696
Getting there first
won't mean anything

1299
01:25:57,698 --> 01:25:59,265
if we don't have a plan.

1300
01:25:59,267 --> 01:26:01,169
Maybe we have a plan.

1301
01:26:04,039 --> 01:26:06,705
Here's where we do it.
Right here in the shallows.

1302
01:26:06,707 --> 01:26:08,473
Use the gliders
and go after it.

1303
01:26:08,475 --> 01:26:10,410
Okay, so, how are we
gonna get it here,

1304
01:26:10,412 --> 01:26:13,179
when there's a beach full
of people to eat right here?

1305
01:26:13,181 --> 01:26:15,616
You ask it out for dinner.

1306
01:26:27,829 --> 01:26:30,497
So...
How do you wanna do this?

1307
01:26:31,399 --> 01:26:32,934
Is that you asking my opinion?

1308
01:26:33,567 --> 01:26:34,766
No.

1309
01:26:34,768 --> 01:26:36,369
I was just being polite

1310
01:26:36,371 --> 01:26:39,604
before telling you
what we're actually doing,

1311
01:26:39,606 --> 01:26:41,374
so you feel
better about yourself.

1312
01:26:41,376 --> 01:26:42,743
Appreciate that.

1313
01:26:49,951 --> 01:26:50,952
What?

1314
01:26:51,419 --> 01:26:53,086
Nothing.

1315
01:26:53,088 --> 01:26:54,155
We're ready.

1316
01:28:17,072 --> 01:28:19,238
Pippin!

1317
01:29:45,426 --> 01:29:46,928
Oh, my God!

1318
01:29:58,239 --> 01:30:00,173
We're close enough.
Stop here.

1319
01:30:00,175 --> 01:30:02,408
Jaxx, DJ, we gotta get
that thing in the water.

1320
01:30:02,410 --> 01:30:03,444
Yeah, we're on it.

1321
01:31:00,401 --> 01:31:04,105
Shark! Shark!

1322
01:33:09,397 --> 01:33:11,530
<i>Any last
thoughts about our plan?</i>

1323
01:33:11,532 --> 01:33:13,599
Not dying
would be a good start.

1324
01:33:13,601 --> 01:33:16,068
Finally,
we agree on something.

1325
01:33:16,070 --> 01:33:18,304
<i>Let's not make it a habit.</i>

1326
01:33:18,306 --> 01:33:20,108
<i>Suyin, look out!
Get out of there!</i>

1327
01:33:31,052 --> 01:33:32,551
- Damn it!
- What's wrong, Jonas?

1328
01:33:32,553 --> 01:33:35,089
Can't make the shot.
It's too close to the ship.

1329
01:33:36,457 --> 01:33:37,492
Jesus!

1330
01:33:39,862 --> 01:33:41,460
<i>Jonas, it's on you.</i>

1331
01:33:41,462 --> 01:33:42,497
Mac!

1332
01:33:45,868 --> 01:33:47,366
Jonas, what's going on
down there?

1333
01:33:47,368 --> 01:33:49,370
Trying to stay
out of its mouth.

1334
01:34:11,025 --> 01:34:12,226
Jeez!

1335
01:34:20,067 --> 01:34:21,335
Oops.

1336
01:34:23,204 --> 01:34:24,770
<i>Suyin, are you set?
I'm coming to you.</i>

1337
01:34:24,772 --> 01:34:26,472
I'm in position.

1338
01:34:26,474 --> 01:34:27,908
<i>Shark's getting close.</i>

1339
01:34:27,910 --> 01:34:29,610
I need a little
breathing room.

1340
01:34:35,918 --> 01:34:38,286
- I'm ready to fire.
- <i>Take the shot.</i>

1341
01:34:40,087 --> 01:34:41,322
<i>Move! Move!</i>

1342
01:35:02,176 --> 01:35:04,477
Anybody see it?

1343
01:35:04,479 --> 01:35:06,245
<i>Can't see the shark, but
something's going on up here.</i>

1344
01:35:16,390 --> 01:35:18,726
<i>Okay,
I've got her attention.</i>

1345
01:35:21,996 --> 01:35:23,197
Bring her to me.

1346
01:35:23,799 --> 01:35:25,066
Here we come.

1347
01:35:28,035 --> 01:35:30,071
Make your move, Suyin.

1348
01:35:33,474 --> 01:35:35,710
Chew on this,
you ugly bastard.

1349
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:40,782
No, no, no! Shit!

1350
01:35:42,885 --> 01:35:44,085
Jeez!

1351
01:36:08,609 --> 01:36:11,445
No, no, no. Go! Go! Go!

1352
01:36:23,124 --> 01:36:25,291
- Where's DJ?
- I don't know.

1353
01:36:25,293 --> 01:36:26,659
- Where's Meiying?
- I don't know!

1354
01:36:26,661 --> 01:36:28,795
- <i>I couldn't see her anywhere.</i>
- Jonas.

1355
01:36:28,797 --> 01:36:30,765
- <i>Sorry, I...</i>
- Go, go. Take care of Meiying.

1356
01:36:38,539 --> 01:36:39,839
Jonas!

1357
01:36:39,841 --> 01:36:42,310
<i>I'm okay. I'm leading
it away from the ship.</i>

1358
01:36:45,580 --> 01:36:49,049
- Oh, my God! Gotta get...
- Stop splashing!

1359
01:36:49,051 --> 01:36:51,250
You have a life jacket on!

1360
01:36:51,252 --> 01:36:53,285
- A life jacket?
- Yep.

1361
01:36:53,287 --> 01:36:55,421
Oh, yeah.
I've got a life jacket on.

1362
01:36:55,423 --> 01:36:57,425
It's right here. I can...

1363
01:36:58,125 --> 01:36:59,859
The monster's here.

1364
01:36:59,861 --> 01:37:01,293
The monster's here?

1365
01:37:01,295 --> 01:37:02,528
No, don't worry
about the monster, I got you.

1366
01:37:02,530 --> 01:37:04,833
- Everything's fine.
- Stop talking.

1367
01:37:09,037 --> 01:37:10,235
Meiying!

1368
01:37:10,237 --> 01:37:12,338
Mummy! It's you!

1369
01:37:12,340 --> 01:37:14,740
That's good! Wait! Wait!
Wait for me.

1370
01:37:14,742 --> 01:37:17,276
Wait for DJ,
wait for DJ. Yeah.

1371
01:37:17,278 --> 01:37:18,546
- Yes.
- Come on.

1372
01:37:19,948 --> 01:37:21,883
Mummy, are you okay?

1373
01:37:23,785 --> 01:37:25,284
I'm okay.

1374
01:37:25,286 --> 01:37:27,421
I'm okay, too.

1375
01:37:30,358 --> 01:37:31,559
Come on. Come up!

1376
01:37:33,427 --> 01:37:35,895
- Meiying, be careful.
- Jonas!

1377
01:37:35,897 --> 01:37:37,864
Careful! Careful!

1378
01:37:37,866 --> 01:37:39,833
- There it is.
- Oh, my God.

1379
01:37:39,835 --> 01:37:41,333
Jonas!

1380
01:37:41,335 --> 01:37:42,601
It's coming.

1381
01:37:42,603 --> 01:37:43,903
We're sitting ducks
up here, Jonas.

1382
01:37:43,905 --> 01:37:45,604
- <i>Mummy!</i>
- <i>It's coming.</i>

1383
01:37:45,606 --> 01:37:47,473
- <i>Can you hear me, Jonas?</i>
- <i>Meiying, hold on.</i>

1384
01:37:47,475 --> 01:37:49,208
<i>Suyin, we're gonna
have to go. Through here.</i>

1385
01:37:49,210 --> 01:37:51,710
Jonas, we've got nothing left.

1386
01:37:51,712 --> 01:37:53,379
Almost nothing.

1387
01:37:53,381 --> 01:37:55,048
How're you gonna kill it?

1388
01:37:55,050 --> 01:37:56,248
<i>Evolution.</i>

1389
01:37:56,250 --> 01:37:58,517
I'm gonna
make this thing bleed.

1390
01:37:58,519 --> 01:38:00,787
<i>Suyin, what you said before,
you were right.</i>

1391
01:38:00,789 --> 01:38:02,690
It's not about
the people you lose.

1392
01:38:04,826 --> 01:38:06,895
<i>It's about the people
you save.</i>

1393
01:38:08,596 --> 01:38:10,331
- Signing off.
- <i>Jonas!</i>

1394
01:38:17,371 --> 01:38:18,539
Here we go.

1395
01:38:25,479 --> 01:38:27,849
How do you like that? Bleed!

1396
01:38:36,490 --> 01:38:37,893
Come on, come on, come on.

1397
01:38:48,103 --> 01:38:49,169
Come on.

1398
01:40:44,286 --> 01:40:45,519
Hey!

1399
01:40:46,021 --> 01:40:47,055
Hey!

1400
01:40:51,392 --> 01:40:52,593
Yes!

1401
01:41:20,889 --> 01:41:21,890
Thank you.

1402
01:41:25,759 --> 01:41:27,526
Beep-beep!
Coming through, Crazy.

1403
01:41:27,528 --> 01:41:28,964
- Hi.
- Look who it is.

1404
01:41:32,466 --> 01:41:33,632
Well,

1405
01:41:33,634 --> 01:41:35,971
here's to being alive.

1406
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:40,976
And to our friends.

1407
01:41:47,448 --> 01:41:48,649
Cheers!

1408
01:41:52,686 --> 01:41:54,486
I don't know about you.

1409
01:41:54,488 --> 01:41:57,489
But, uh,
I could use a vacation.

1410
01:41:57,491 --> 01:41:59,027
Shall we ask my mum?

1411
