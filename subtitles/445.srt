1
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,317
Well?

2
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,631
- I'm sending you the code.
- Yes, I see that. Thank you.

3
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,034
- What about my account?
- Delivering.

4
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,794
I just sent it. You should have it.

5
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,156
- Yes. Thank you.
- Hey, are you sure this is legal?

6
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,596
We're just running a test
on our security system, sir. It's fine.

7
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,036
You've got a sexy voice.
Is there anything else I can do for you?

8
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,076
- To you?
- We have all we need.

9
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,475
We're ready.

10
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,916
Yo, guess who just made 50 Gs today.

11
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,236
- What'd you do to my drive?
- I didn't touch it.

12
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,153
This isn't cool.
Don't ever, ever touch my computer.

13
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,317
Diagnostics show no damage,
but this was an intentional breach.

14
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,198
- We were hacked?
- It wasn't "Denial of Service" level,

15
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,953
but they definitely cracked our door.

16
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,231
OK. Open the Black Hat files.

17
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,154
I want every hacker in the country
who could have done this interviewed now.

18
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:29,109
Sir, that's close to 1,000 names. This
holiday weekend we're short-staffed as it is.

19
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,034
We're the ones supposed to keep this from
happening, and it happened to us. Do it.

20
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,588
Sir, it's night.
They're all over the country.

21
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,477
Get local law enforcement help.

22
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,554
Somebody out there thinks they can
screw with us. I wanna find out who.

23
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,709
- Jim! I said no.
- Lucy, you're killin' me, all right?

24
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,788
- Get out!
- What?!

25
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,996
- Get out of the car now!
- Don't touch me.

26
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,877
- No means no.
- What are you doin'?

27
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,270
- John, stop it!
- Don't call me that. I hate it when you do.

28
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,874
- You know this guy?
- Just shut your mouth right now.

29
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,554
Dad! Stop it. I mean it.

30
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,552
- "Dad"? You said your dad was dead.
- What?

31
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,272
You told this jerk-off I was dead?
You actually said that?

32
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,113
I may have exaggerated a little bit.

33
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,350
And this guy's what? Your boyfriend?

34
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,476
- No.
- Yeah.

35
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,152
I don't know, OK?
I'm sorry. We'll see.

36
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,998
What are you doing here?

37
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,755
- You don't answer your phone, return calls.
- Because I'm not talking to you.

38
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,356
- Why aren't we talking this time, Lucy?
- Why not? What? You want a list?

39
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,991
How about stuff like this: you spy on me,
you drag my boyfriend out of the car...

40
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,991
- You said he's not your boyfriend.
- He's not!

41
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,958
- I thought you said I just was.
- Shut up.

42
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,149
You are such an asshole.

43
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:15,509
OK. I'm sorry I pulled your "not-boyfriend"
out of the car, OK?

44
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,074
- Lucy, baby, get in the car. Let's go.
- No, no.

45
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,435
- Will both of you go away?
- Just talk to me.

46
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,114
I'm tired. I'm going to bed... alone.

47
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,590
Damn right you're going to bed alone.

48
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,510
Lucy, honey, wait a minute.
I wanna talk to you. Just wait.

49
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,398
Dad, when I wanna talk to you -

50
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,711
If I wanna talk to you -

51
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,191
I'll call you.

52
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,431
Lucy. Wait, Lucy. Lucy!

53
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,069
- Lucy McClane.
- It's not McClane. It's Gennero.

54
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,511
Chicks, right?

55
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,956
I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go.

56
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,310
John?

57
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,709
John? It's Sclavino.

58
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,035
- Go for McClane.
- What are you doing at Rutgers?

59
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,430
- How do you know where I am?
- Our cars were LoJacked four years ago.

60
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,718
- I'm staring at exactly where you are.
- Sir, that's not something I would turn on.

61
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,917
Yeah, we did that.
John, we turned them on.

62
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,275
Listen, the feds have called in a favour.

63
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,592
They're doing a sweep. They want us to
pick up some computer hacker in Camden.

64
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,672
Last name: Farrell.
First name: Matthew.

65
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,513
Whoa, whoa. Camden?
What are you telling me this for?

66
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,876
- Just came in.
- Vino, it's 3am. I was on my way home.

67
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,793
Send a jughead from the Academy.
They'd be happy to do it.

68
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:10,192
I can't just send in a uniform.
The feds demanded a senior detective.

69
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,669
The kid's a high-value subject -
I don't know.

70
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,275
Just pick him up, escort him
to the Hoover Building in DC.

71
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,069
They had some kind of a computer breach
there this morning.

72
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,037
Great!

73
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,069
All right, give me that information.
Give me that name again. What is it?

74
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,878
You owe me one, Jack.

75
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,595
What?

76
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,557
Aw, come on.

77
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,118
Goddammit.

78
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,633
- Who is it?
- NYPD. Open the door, please.

79
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,549
- Hi.
- NYPD?

80
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,236
OK. Oh, I get it. Don't worry, everyone
gets lost around here. Glad to help. Take...

81
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,949
Hey, I'm not lost. Are you Matthew Farrell?

82
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,191
No. He, uh... actually
does not live here any more.

83
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,750
- Course not. Who are you?
- My name is Daisy Duke.

84
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:38,119
Got a lot of shit for it when I was a kid.
Please don't add to it.

85
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,875
- Can I see some identification, please?
- Yeah, sure.

86
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,311
Oh, "Detective"!

87
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,949
Yeah, that looks real!
You get that at Toys "R" Us? Looks great.

88
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:54,556
- Then of course...
- Yeah. That... actually looks pretty good.

89
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,396
Mmm.

90
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,712
Farrell! Sully PDL-ed the new copy of
the Kill Zone Nine. Wanna check it out?

91
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,078
No! Thanks, though, man.
And good luck at the Bad Timing Awards.

92
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,155
Open the door.

93
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,593
Shit.

94
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,069
Can I get you something?
Coffee? A warrant?

95
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,277
- What's this about?
- I don't know. Some computer thing.

96
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,238
DC feds wanna talk to you, so let's go.

97
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,598
- Feds, huh?
- Yeah. The feds.

98
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,278
I've been White Hat for four years,
but once you're on that goddamn list...

99
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,078
Such a pain in the ass.

100
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,469
- You play with dolls?
- Huh?

101
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,835
- Could you not touch that?
- Like a Gl Joe?

102
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,195
No, it's not. It's a limited edition...

103
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,713
- Ooh.
- .. and...

104
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,315
- That supposed to come off?
- No, but it's more valuable broken,

105
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,154
- so thanks for that.
- Krazy Glue. I'm sure it's very important.

106
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,390
I got some other cool shit you can break.

107
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,155
- Let's go, OK? Come on.
- I gotta power down my gear, OK?

108
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,150
More dolls. Not spending
a whole lot of time with the girls, huh?

109
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,270
Hey! Are you really trying to escape?

110
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,193
Ow! Jesus, don't shoot!

111
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,633
Get down!

112
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,035
- Jesus Christ.
- Stay right there.

113
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,110
Go!

114
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,272
Let's go. Come on.
Low, low! Stay down!

115
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,476
- Agh!
- Come on.

116
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,675
It's all right.
Stay low, all right? Stay down.

117
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,036
- You stay with me, all right? Here we go.
- OK.

118
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,438
OK.

119
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,591
That'll wake the neighbours.

120
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,557
Get down! Get inside!

121
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,238
They're back in the room!
They're back in the room!

122
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,791
Are you nuts? Get outta there right now!

123
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,438
- I'm trying to...
- Now!

124
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,959
Get back in there!

125
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,275
Aaargh! Argh!

126
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,911
Get ready to run.

127
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,957
- What the hell was that?
- What?

128
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,918
- Did you do that?
- No.

129
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,833
- Shit.
- I didn't do that. Come on.

130
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,277
- Shit.
- Stay close. The whole apartment's on fire.

131
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,157
Come on. Let's go.
Come on, let's go, goddammit!

132
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,556
Come on.

133
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,551
Watch it. Slow it down.

134
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,235
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

135
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,550
Hey, let's go. Come on.

136
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,190
Come on, come on. Stay close.

137
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,720
Stay with me. Stay with me.

138
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,796
Come on, let's go. Stay close.

139
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,348
Get in the car. Go, go.

140
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,870
- Kid, can you reload a gun?
- What? Me?

141
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,155
- Can you reload a gun?!
- I...

142
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,237
Open the glove box
and get a magazine out right now!

143
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,069
Grab the gun from the back seat!

144
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,553
You OK?

145
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,395
Get your head down.

146
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,075
Jesus! Is the circus in town?

147
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,754
Whoa!

148
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,995
- Did you see that?
- Yeah, I saw it. I did it.

149
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,956
Camden base, 10077. Come back.
Camden base, 10077.

150
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,393
Go ahead.

151
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,189
I need to speak to your chief of your
detectives. Police emergency, asap.

152
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,713
Stand by.

153
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:08,032
- This is Chief Detective Wiesman.
- This is Detective John McClane, NYPD.

154
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:12,318
Police emergency. I wanna report
a police shooting in your jurisdiction.

155
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,110
- Yeah?
- What's the status?

156
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,073
Wait one.

157
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:06,280
Thomas. We had a problem in New Jersey.
Farrell's still alive.

158
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,869
- So he got away.
- Yeah.

159
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,190
I did send five of you, is that right?

160
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,710
I'm sending a chopper. Get airborne and we'll
track 'em down. Think you can handle that?

161
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,277
- Oh, my God.
- Just breathe.

162
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,636
I am breathing! I'm-I'm...
I can't stop shaking.

163
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,473
It's the adrenaline.
You're just scared. It'll pass.

164
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,553
Yeah, I'm scared!
Weren't you scared, back there?

165
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,712
Yeah. I was scared.

166
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:44,316
Really? This is you being scared?
I don't know, cos you seem really calm.

167
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,550
Have you done stuff like that before?

168
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,155
- Stuff like what?
- Like killing people.

169
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,190
Yeah. But not for a long time.

170
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,232
So who were those guys, huh?
Why were they trying to kill you?

171
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,596
Why did they blow up
my goddamn apartment?!

172
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,513
They were there to kill you.

173
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,549
- Why would they want to kill me?
- You tell me, kid. You're the criminal.

174
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,829
We got seven dead hackers so far,
none of whom were high on our list.

175
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,469
- Get the hard drives, start sweepin' 'em.
- Yes, sir.

176
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,997
Trey. Matthew Farrell - find him for me.

177
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,832
On it.

178
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,155
What's with all the guns?

179
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,835
Operational prudence.

180
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,279
Think of them as hardware to your software.

181
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:08,076
Good morning, DC! It's shaping up
to be a beautiful Fourth of July weekend.

182
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,790
Ifyou've got any big plans, get started
early, cos the traffic is ramping up.

183
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,395
So here's another golden oldie
for all the commuters out there.

184
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,074
What? What... What...

185
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,355
What are you doing? What is that?

186
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,317
- It's Creedence.
- Creedence?

187
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,393
Creedence. Creedence Clearwater
Revival? Classic rock?

188
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,597
I know who it is. It's old rock.
Doesn't make it classic.

189
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,513
- What sucked then sucks now.
- You don't like Creedence?

190
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,637
This is like having a pine cone
shoved in my ass.

191
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,395
OK. Really? Wow, that's mature.

192
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,357
Come on. I'm cooperating with you.

193
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,037
We're at a heading of060.
Making another pass.

194
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,919
Listen up, everyone.
Are we ready?

195
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,558
Transportation hubs are prepped and set.

196
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,596
Begin stage one.

197
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,912
What? Nothing.

198
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,718
When'd you last turn on the radio and listen
to popular music? Just give me a decade.

199
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,713
The '70s? I'm guessing.
Was Michael Jackson still black?

200
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,633
Pearl Jam.
I'll go back ten years with you. Ten years.

201
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,551
20 years. The Cure? Nothin'?

202
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:52,760
It's called news radio. I want to see if your
friends from Camden made the headlines.

203
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,115
Hold on. You listen to the news?

204
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,158
You got a problem with the news now?

205
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,152
Yeah. I got a big goddamn problem
with the news.

206
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,789
Ready for this?
The news is completely manipulated.

207
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,952
Everyhing you hear, every single day,

208
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:12,989
is designed by corporate media to do
one thing only: to keep you living in fear.

209
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,877
- Oh, fear?
- Total fear.

210
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,919
So you'll go out and spend money
on things you probably don't even need,

211
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,639
so advertisers
keep buying ads on their stations.

212
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,599
I'll tell you one more thing. I'll do this
all day. I got days of data at home...

213
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,318
- Hey.
- I'll drop a bomb on you...

214
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,389
- Hey!
- What?

215
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,758
- Shut up.
- That's good. Be dismissive instead of...

216
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,954
- You all right?
- No, I'm not all right!

217
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,478
Just stay in the car. You'll be all right.

218
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,636
Hey, man. Hey.

219
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,238
You all right? Don't move.
Just call 911, all right?

220
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,231
OK.

221
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,953
Jesus Christ.

222
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,754
- All the lights are green.
- Huh?

223
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,400
All the lights are green.
Let's go. Right now.

224
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,472
- We gotta go?
- Get your bag, hack-boy. Let's go.

225
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,159
- Let's go.
- I've never been in a car accident.

226
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,470
Well, it's very exciting. This way, come on.

227
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,312
- You been in a car accident?
- Yeah.

228
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,549
What are we doing?

229
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:24,077
It's a little thing they invented in the '60s
called jogging. You're gonna love it.

230
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,999
Sir, Chicago's reporting
a systems crash on the el train network.

231
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,632
Amtrak is flashing a level-one crash
in their com system.

232
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,793
FAA just issued a critical alert.
Their ATC net just went down.

233
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,791
We're under attack.

234
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,079
OK, let's get 'em outside for a little fresh air.

235
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,836
That's the anthrax alarm.

236
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,438
All right, everyone out. Now! Now!

237
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,992
Taylor, move! Go! Move!

238
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:36,234
All personnel must evacuate and proceed
to the transportation shuttles immediately.

239
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,231
This is not a drill.

240
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:44,077
All personnel must evacuate and proceed
to the transportation shuttles immediately.

241
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,033
We need you inside, sir.

242
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,431
Take your team. I want men
on the fourth floor, got it? Masks on.

243
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,113
We gotta know what's there.

244
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,476
Run a trunk search on these data crashes,
try to ID the point of origin.

245
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,351
Begin stage two.

246
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,192
Hey, what's going on?

247
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,508
They're already starting to panic.

248
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,476
Of course they are.

249
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,994
They think that someone's
taking their money.

250
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,675
All those nickels and dimes they saved
had meaning.

251
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,672
"Useful idiots", as Lenin would say.

252
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,556
Prep the video package.

253
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:17,549
DC transportation system's crashing and
they just hit the financial sector. All of it.

254
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:22,236
Get me the secretary for trans and treasury
on the line and the chairman of the SEC.

255
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,552
Let's go, people. Somewhere
somebody left a digital fingerprint. Find it.

256
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,311
- Deputy Director Bowman in here?
- Not now. It'll have to wait.

257
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,359
Not today. This is Matthew Farrell.
I brought him here on orders from Bowman.

258
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,432
If you don't know what's goin' on,
find somebody that does.

259
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,669
I'm Bowman.

260
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,073
Video package is ready for upload.

261
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,635
John, I appreciate your bringing Farrell,

262
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,598
but we are neck-deep
in damage control right now.

263
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:59,673
Excuse me. I'm sorry, sir. Do you have
anything to eat, any snacks around?

264
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,149
I'd love...
I've got really low blood sugar...

265
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,435
- Sir?
- No?

266
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:12,675
As if the transportation breakdown and
anthrax scares weren't enough for one day,

267
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,718
the stock market
found itself in a selling frenzy.

268
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,598
The FTC believes this panic
might have been triggered

269
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,911
by a computer malfunction
in the stock exchange.

270
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,992
Oh, man, that is all bad.

271
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:29,073
It's not as bad as it looks. We run drills
to prepare for things like this.

272
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,717
- These your suspects?
- Were.

273
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,314
All seven were killed in the last 24 hours.

274
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,549
Recognise any of these people?

275
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,274
No.

276
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,078
Not one?

277
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,958
Sir, we got a system error.

278
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,435
- My fellow Americans...
- .. it is time to...

279
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,512
strike... fear... into...
the hearts of... citizenry.

280
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,909
- Ask not...
- That's an unauthorised broadcast.

281
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,878
.. what your country can do...
to avert... this... crisis.

282
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,633
- The answer is...
- .. nothing whatsoever.

283
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,076
Our military... strength...
is... in this case...

284
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,388
.. useless.

285
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,878
Read my lips.

286
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:25,115
The... great... confident... roar...
of... American... progress... and... growth...

287
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,760
has come to... an end.

288
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,833
All the... vital... technology...
that... this nation... holds dear...

289
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,879
all... communications... transportation...
the internet... connectivity...

290
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,872
electrical... power...
critical... utilities...

291
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:43,598
their... fate... now... rests...
in... our... hands.

292
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:47,036
We will not tire, we will not falter,

293
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,838
and we will not fail.

294
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,559
I don't know how they're getting in.

295
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,470
Thank you.

296
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,233
And a... happy Independence Day...
to everyone.

297
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,592
That was creepy.

298
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,477
I tried to find more Nixon.

299
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,077
Think they bought it?

300
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,116
Absolutely.

301
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,752
OK, I want telecom, transportation...

302
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,513
- Jesus Christ, it's a fire sale.
- What?

303
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,112
It's a fire sale.

304
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,475
Hey. We don't know that yet.

305
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,677
- It's a myth, anyway. It can't be done.
- It's a myth? Really?

306
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,194
Please tell me
she's not in charge of anything.

307
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,157
What's a fire sale?

308
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,518
It's a three-step systematic attack
on the entire national infrastructure.

309
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,798
Step one: take out transportation.
Step two: the financial base and telecoms.

310
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,634
Step three: get rid of all the utilities -
gas, water, electric, nuclear...

311
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,998
Anything that's run by computers,
which today is almost everyhing.

312
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,038
That's why they call it a fire sale -
everyhing must go.

313
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,509
Hey, listen... What's your name? Farrell?

314
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:54,593
Keep your voice down, OK?
No one here's talking about a fire sale.

315
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:58,559
Not unless you're telling me
you helped plan one.

316
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,870
No, man. I'm just saying...

317
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,474
Appreciate your concern.
We're on it. Thank you.

318
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,393
- You've done a bang-up job so far.
- What? What?

319
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,278
Nothing. I said I understand.

320
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,397
Hey. They didn't send the girl scouts out
to get this kid.

321
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,314
They sent professional guys, full
tactical gear. They blew the whole joint up.

322
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,996
Now, I don't know this kid,
and frankly I don't give a shit - no offence -

323
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,230
but somebody wants this kid dead,

324
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:27,359
and obviously it's got something to do
with whatever's going on here.

325
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,750
OK. Homeland's interrogating
the hackers we're bringing in.

326
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,638
I'll get you an escort over there. All right?

327
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:38,874
Molina, get this kid to the front of the line.
I wanna know what he knows.

328
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,918
If he knew half the shit I know,
his head would explode.

329
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,829
Special Agent Johnson. We'll take the sedan.

330
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:48,390
- Agent Johnson?
- That's right. Right this way.

331
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,792
Great. So is any of that actually possible,
what you were saying back there?

332
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,237
Is it possible? Look, you take out
any one thing, the system can recover.

333
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:02,519
If you take it all down at once, the system
crashes and... Look around, man.

334
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:07,071
Come on. Government's gotta have dozens
of departments dedicated to that shit.

335
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:11,233
It took FEMA five days
to get water to the Superdome.

336
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,874
How long till we get to DHS?

337
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:40,556
Laughlin, get on the DC police band
and get 'em to clear a route to DHS for us.

338
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,438
DC Metro, this is the FBl
requesting you to clear a route...

339
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,276
Farrell just resurfaced on the grid.

340
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,315
- Feds are taking him to Homeland.
- Good.

341
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,073
- Close that loop, now.
- Isolate the frequency.

342
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:59,472
Get us a location on the vehicles
and pull me up a file on this John McClane.

343
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,552
Rand, we just found Farrell.
Stand by for a location.

344
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,394
I don't mean to harp, but we just passed
another Arby's, and I'm starving.

345
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,550
- I could eat a wrapper.
- Shut up.

346
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,712
- I could just get some ketchup packets.
- Shut up.

347
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,473
You got about 14 minutes
to tell me why you lied to me.

348
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,835
Lied to you? What are you talking about?

349
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,195
The pictures on the wall -
you knew those guys.

350
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,794
- I don't...
- Kid, don't lie to me.

351
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,952
I'm a cop. I can tell you're lying.
Who were they?

352
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,274
OK. OK, OK.

353
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,432
They were my competition.

354
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,109
Make the next right onto Concord.

355
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,397
They said they'd developed
a mutating encryption algorithm

356
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,789
and they wanted to see if it could be cracked.

357
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,190
That's what I do. I do math-based security.

358
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:01,791
Here's the thing. To pull off something
as massive and crazy as a fire sale,

359
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:05,793
you need tons of guys to write programs,
but only a few Black Hats to implement it.

360
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:10,317
At that point the start-up guys, who haven't
really done anything wrong, like me...

361
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,755
Would end up as pictures on some guy's wall.

362
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:18,039
I swear to God, McClane, I swear to you
I had no idea I was gonna be...

363
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,989
an accessory to Armageddon.

364
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,471
Take the next left at Lexington.

365
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:27,553
And that's a sexy voice.
What's she taking us this way for?

366
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,232
- Unit 510.
- Oh, my God.

367
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:32,312
Clear a route for two FBl vehicles
approaching on Concord.

368
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,628
Copy, dispatch.

369
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,119
That's her.

370
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,156
- Her who?
- What are you talking about?

371
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,395
- It's them.
- You're saying it's them them?

372
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:45,234
I swear to you I know her.
I would know her voice anywhere.

373
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,592
- No, don't say anything...
- Just keep your mouth shut for a minute.

374
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,148
Hey, Metro, how's your day goin' over there?

375
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:57,472
Gotta be pretty crazy over there,
what with all those 587s, huh?

376
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,438
Yes, sir. We've had to dispatch all units.

377
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:05,519
You had to dispatch all units
for all the naked people walking around?

378
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,910
Cut the bullshit, honey,
and just put your boss on.

379
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,271
Laughlin, we're getting off this route.
Turn left on 14th Street.

380
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,554
- Officer McClane.
- It's Detective McClane, asshole.

381
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,634
Don't worry. We'll have plenty of time to get
to know each other when I visit you in prison.

382
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,917
But, John, I already know
so much about you.

383
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,036
Your address in Brooklyn,

384
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:41,591
the payments on your mortgage, how long
you've been a member of the NYPD.

385
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,352
And how's Holly?

386
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,513
Oh, that's sad. You're divorced.
Was that tough on little Jack and Lucy?

387
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:54,560
Now, this is sad. After 30 years I thought
you'd have a better pension plan annuity.

388
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,393
Oh, and it gets worse.

389
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,558
Your 401k no longer exists.

390
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,872
- Tell you what. Let me make it up to you.
- Box them in at that intersection.

391
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,918
Shoot Mr Farrell in the head
and drive away,

392
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,594
and by the time you reach
the end of the next block

393
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:18,038
all your debts will be wiped clean
and your children will be set for life.

394
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,556
Now, that really is tempting,
especially that last part,

395
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,632
but I think I'm gonna have to pass, jerk-off.

396
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,752
John, you're a Timex watch in a digital age.

397
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,592
You're gonna lose.

398
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,389
Yeah, well, the other thing that could
happen is I could come and find you,

399
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,916
kick your ass and throw you out of
your own party. What about that?

400
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,195
Hold your position.

401
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,352
He's not responding.

402
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,754
Get down! Get right down!

403
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,078
Just stay down!

404
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,315
Officers down at the corner of
Main and Constitution. Officers down!

405
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,875
Come on, come on, get out! Let's go!

406
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,872
Goddammit! Just stay down!

407
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,355
Get down! Just hang on!

408
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:49,874
Base, we've got a squad car under fire!
We need backup!

409
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,520
This is base. We're sending backup.

410
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,035
Just brace yourself.

411
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,709
Hang on.

412
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,279
Hang on.

413
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,198
Oh, yeah!

414
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,032
- We lost the tail.
- Stay with them.

415
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,792
- They're back.
- I know.

416
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,353
Take the tunnel. Left!

417
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,118
God, what are you... Oh, God!

418
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,636
Bring up the schematics on that tunnel.

419
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,199
The tunnel!

420
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,670
Open the gates on the north side entrance.

421
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,431
Redirect traffic to occupy all lanes.

422
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,474
- Now open the other side.
- What?

423
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,788
Move!

424
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,199
Hang onto something.

425
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,871
Hey! Don't get out of the car!
Hey! Don't...

426
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,510
Just stay there! Stand still!

427
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,395
Run. Run!

428
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,195
Oh, God!

429
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,232
Don't hesitate like that again.

430
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,072
Can you help me get my wife...

431
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,515
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

432
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:34,479
- You OK?
- I can't move my arms!

433
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,632
- Just stay here. Stay right here for a minute.
- What?!

434
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,280
"It can't be a uniform, John. No."

435
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,709
Get over to the wall, sir!
"Feds called in a favour."

436
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:51,717
"All you gotta do is go pick up a kid
down in Jersey, drive him down to DC."

437
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,236
"How hard can that be, huh?
It can't be that hard, can it?"

438
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:59,711
"No, gotta be a senior detective."

439
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,753
Think a traffic jam, throwing a car
at me's gonna stop me? Huh?

440
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,876
Rand, get in there and get it done.

441
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,630
This is not a good idea.

442
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,993
- Don't touch me, don't touch me.
- OK, sorry, sorry.

443
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,196
Are you OK? Oh, my God!

444
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,469
- Pretty lucky shot, huh?
- Oh, yeah, lucky. That was...

445
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,710
You just killed a helicopter with a car.

446
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,791
I was out of bullets.

447
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,434
- How you doin'?
- I skinned my knee, my asthma's acting up...

448
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:31,153
- Whatever. Yeah, I'm fine.
- Give me a hand. Don't jump outta cars.

449
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,351
Rand, check in.

450
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,434
What about Farrell and McClane?

451
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,869
Come back in.

452
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,996
OK, we're moving on. Begin stage three.

453
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:56,390
I just spoke to Emerson.
The team's arriving at Woodlawn now.

454
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,678
Very good. Mai, get ready for the downloads.

455
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,236
ID, sir.

456
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,990
Park behind the transpo. We'll lead you in.

457
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:14,355
Man the gate. You're with me.

458
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:26,511
Anthrax alarms only went off on five floors.
Below that you'll need DOD clearance.

459
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:30,593
I don't know why you'd need to go further.
There's nothin' down there but servers.

460
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,909
Go again. Rodriguez! I didn't copy.

461
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,838
- Gate secured.
- Copy.

462
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,235
OK, we are in.

463
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,829
This is insane.

464
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,753
Hey! Hey, this is absurd.

465
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:48,960
Man, there's tough and there's stupid.
You gotta go to a hospital. Look at you.

466
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,471
I'm not a doctor, but you're hurt.

467
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,471
- Yeah. Sexy, right?
- No!

468
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:54,788
Come on.

469
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,314
We don't need a doctor.
We need the cops.

470
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,795
He's in.

471
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,553
Get outta the way!
Make a hole, please. Come on.

472
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:33,997
Watch out! Excuse me! Excuse me!
Come on.

473
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:37,038
NYPD. All right? I got this kid.
Come on. Let's go, kid.

474
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,078
Excuse me. Thanks.

475
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,469
NYPD. NYPD.

476
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,551
Coming through.

477
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:49,789
Sergeant?

478
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:52,758
Sergeant! I need to speak to you.

479
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:57,550
- The medic's in the back.
- I'm all right. NYPD. I need to talk to you.

480
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,915
Just give me a minute.

481
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,195
Sergeant!

482
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,511
Oh, my God.

483
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,628
Let's get outta here.

484
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:22,438
Perfetto.
La sequenza due. Pronto...

485
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:27,590
Siamo pronti.

486
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,551
We're a go.

487
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,631
Launch the downloads.

488
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:44,559
- Nothing's happening.
- Be patient.

489
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,876
- I don't know. It's not responding.
- Wait for it.

490
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,075
See? There you go.

491
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,598
- Tell me when the download reaches 20%.
- OK.

492
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:07,998
I need you to please remain calm.

493
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,511
Excuse me.

494
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:15,513
- Excuse me! Thank you.
- Holy shit.

495
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,750
- Kid? Kid, hey!
- Yeah, yeah.

496
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,274
- You got a phone in that bag?
- Yeah.

497
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:22,271
Come on. Let's go.

498
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:29,672
And here you go, Agent... Tovarek.
Guess that's you.

499
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:53,597
- Download's at 20%.
- Time to move.

500
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,638
Let's keep them chasing their tails.

501
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:15,635
Due to recent activity, law
enforcement agencies are being cautious.

502
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:19,998
They are telling drivers to abandon
their vehicles until they are searched.

503
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:23,914
And, as you can see,
canine units are checking each vehicle.

504
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,310
Whether this is connected to
the anthrax reports we heard earlier

505
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,675
or a new terrorist threat, we do not know...

506
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,069
- FAA just grounded all flights.
- Good.

507
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:37,473
We have complete access over networks -
phones, power grids, water, nuclear.

508
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,676
- Hey, excuse me.
- Jack Parry, NSA.

509
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,355
Chuck Summer, DHS liaison.
White House made the call.

510
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,194
- Anything you need, we're here to help.
- Help? Wow, that's great.

511
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,831
We're gonna need some work space
for our people. What can you do for us?

512
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,948
As you can see, we're using the space, so
you guys can stand in the corner and... liaise.

513
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:00,112
If I need something, I'll just wave to you.

514
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,513
- Wait! No, don't call.
- What are you talkin' about?

515
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:28,149
They probably cracked that hours ago.
They could trace us. Put it away.

516
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,958
- You sure?
- Yes.

517
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:33,157
Or... smash it.
You didn't have to smash it.

518
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,879
- Excuse me. It's a police emergency.
- Hey!

519
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,872
He'll call you right back.

520
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,599
Here, right in here. Come here.

521
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,398
- You got a signal?
- Yeah.

522
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,997
- Yeah.
- This is John McClane for Agent Bowman.

523
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,275
Sir, John McClane is on the line.

524
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:53,710
- McClane, go.
- We never made it to DHS.

525
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,473
They came after the kid again.
All your men are down.

526
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,713
- What about Farrell?
- I got him with me right now.

527
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,791
- Sir?
- Hang on, John.

528
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:05,871
Yeah, I'll hold on.

529
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,838
Another day in paradise.

530
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:16,869
They just swarmed into everyhing - the
telecom system, phones, cells, satellites.

531
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,233
- They're blanketing every station.

532
00:51:56,560 --> 00:52:00,519
- Can you put the news back on?
- This is the news. It's on every channel.

533
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:03,000
- Been this way for a few minutes now.

534
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,157
Oh, my God.

535
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,398
McClane!

536
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,349
Look out.

537
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:33,953
Look out!

538
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:36,639
Look out.

539
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,270
Bowman? Bowman, do you see that?

540
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,590
Bowman, it's a fake.

541
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,152
I see it.

542
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,911
Thank God.

543
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,072
Oh, shit.

544
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,878
- McClane?
- Bowman!

545
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,630
Satellite's down. Get me a land line.

546
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:23,553
I wrote one little piece of code and the
world falls apart. This is virtual terrorism.

547
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,676
- What?
- You know, it's crazy.

548
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,354
The first time I heard of the concept
of a fire sale

549
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:32,274
I actually thought it would be cool
if anyone ever really did it.

550
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:37,912
Just hit the reset button
and melt the system just for fun.

551
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,276
Hey, it's not a system. It's a country.

552
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:44,511
You're talkin' about people,
a whole country full of people,

553
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:47,990
sitting at home alone, scared to death
in their houses, all right?

554
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:54,076
So finish your nostalgic moment and think
a little bit and help me catch these guys.

555
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:57,994
Just help me.
Just put yourself in their shoes.

556
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:02,675
Come on. If this were your fire sale,
what would be your next move?

557
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:08,312
OK, uh, well, the whole point of a fire sale
is that it's mostly done by remote, right?

558
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:13,190
But not everyhing is run completely online.
Major utilities aren't.

559
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:16,989
They're run by closed circuits,
so you could breach the security,

560
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:21,073
but to shut it down you'd have to
physically go there. You'd have to show up.

561
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,912
And, uh...

562
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,234
- Give me that guy's PDA.
- Phones are all dead.

563
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:31,678
No, it's the network that's dead. I've just gotta
reprogram it and link it into the old Satcoms.

564
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:36,151
Hackers surf 'em all the time. Probably what
these guys are using to talk to each other.

565
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,912
How do you know all this stuff?

566
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,152
Dude, I don't know. There's a lot
rattling around up there. I couldn't tell you.

567
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,879
OK. National power grid.

568
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:48,350
Gas and electric is divided into three zones -
Eastern, Central, Western -

569
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:50,874
each with a primary hub.

570
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,951
Here it is.

571
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:56,753
- What are we looking at?
- That is the Eastern hub.

572
00:54:56,840 --> 00:55:02,119
Now, they take this out, wipes out all
the power for the entire Eastern Corridor.

573
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:04,555
But, again, you'd have to do it manually.

574
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:09,395
- OK. Come on. Let's go.
- What? To West Virginia?

575
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:13,314
I honestly don't think I can handle
any more people trying to kill me. McClane!

576
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,595
- You get used to it.
- McClane. Oh, shit.

577
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:20,117
Sir, wireless networks are down
and I think they're hitting the land lines, too.

578
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:23,192
I don't care how, you find me a line.

579
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,431
- Come on, what you got?
- We swept the building. Seems clean.

580
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:30,991
- We can sweep it again...
- Don't bother. Don't bother.

581
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:34,277
It's a fake. This guy's playin' us.

582
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,920
OK, get everyone back inside
the crisis centre now.

583
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,638
OK, let's open it up!

584
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:43,920
- Come on, get in.
- Door's locked.

585
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:48,355
Unless you have an extra gun
I can use to unlock it.

586
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:52,832
Hey. Hey, don't do that!
You're gonna disable it.

587
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,439
Jesus Christ!

588
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,677
That was crazy. Did you see that?

589
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:02,833
Sorry about that, man.
I didn't know it'd come out so fast.

590
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,276
Man, this is a pain in the ass.
How'd you do yours?

591
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:13,278
You all right? What? Did it hit you a little bit?

592
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:15,191
Sorry.

593
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:22,192
No, please don't touch those, OK?
I know what I'm doing. I've done this before.

594
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,999
I mean, I've read about it.

595
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,992
RoadAssist. We've detected
an air-bag deployment.

596
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:32,437
Yes... Please, we just hit a tree
and my... my dad is having a heart attack.

597
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,875
I think he's gonna die. You need to help us.

598
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,633
Hold while we contact emergency services.

599
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:42,589
No, no! He's dying! I can get him
to a hospital. I can drive. I'm fine.

600
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:47,515
But I can't really turn the key, so you gotta
start the car for us, OK? Please, Dad...

601
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:50,114
- Your name, please?
- I'm...

602
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,912
My name is... Frank,

603
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,516
and my dad's name is, um... is...

604
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:02,917
Dvorak... Tsajanski.

605
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:07,875
Please... Please, just help us.
We need your help. Please.

606
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:10,076
Emergency services are on their way.

607
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,833
No, no, listen to me.
Ma'am, what is your name?

608
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,558
- Dolores.
- Dolores?

609
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,757
OK, Dolores, I don't know
if you have a dad, but I do,

610
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:20,070
and I wanna be able to say that
a year from now.

611
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:23,994
Because my dad is my hero,
and right now he is in my arms dying,

612
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:28,153
and his only hope is to get to a hospital
right now. We can't wait.

613
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,435
So please start the goddamn car!

614
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:36,478
Thank you, Dolores.

615
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,915
Pass the PDA.
I gotta call the Warlock.

616
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,436
- The what?
- The Warlock. A digital Jedi. He's amazing.

617
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:03,109
- Ma'am, you're not authorised to be here.
- FBl. We suspect a security breach.

618
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,873
You can't land here without authorisa...

619
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,239
That was pretty good back there, kid.

620
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:28,799
Thanks.

621
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,429
What's the matter with you?
Nothing else to complain about?

622
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:34,909
No. I'm just...

623
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,516
- Well, what? What's the matter you?
- I'm not like you. I can't do this shit.

624
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:42,034
What's that mean? Like what?

625
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:46,671
I'm not, like, heroic and everyhing.
I'm not brave like you are.

626
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,354
- I'm not that guy.
- I'm nobody's hero, kid.

627
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,954
You've saved my life, like,
ten times in six hours.

628
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:55,112
Just doing my job, that's all.

629
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:01,276
Know what you get for being a hero?
Nothing. You get shot at.

630
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:05,273
You get a little pat on the back,
blah-blah-blah. Attaboy.

631
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,950
You get divorced.

632
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:12,998
A wife that can't remember your last name.

633
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:15,389
Your kids don't wanna talk to you.

634
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:19,637
You get to eat a lot of meals by yourself.

635
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:23,156
Trust me, kid, nobody wants to be that guy.

636
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:27,468
- Then why are you doin' this?
- Cos there's nobody else to do it right now.

637
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:30,518
If there was somebody else to do it,
I would let them do it.

638
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:33,433
But there's not. So we're doin' it.

639
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:35,195
Ah.

640
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,475
And that's what makes you that guy.

641
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,911
Thing's flying now.

642
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,798
Contact Emerson.
Tell him we'll be there soon.

643
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:00,749
What the hell are you doing?
This whole floor's restricted acc...

644
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,794
Stay here.

645
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,511
All right, come on.

646
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:17,113
- We're in.
- Good. Shut it down.

647
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,316
Guess you were right, kid.

648
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:32,517
OK, that's... awful.

649
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:35,878
We got company.

650
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,709
- How would they shut down a power grid?
- What?

651
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:50,759
- Come on.
- Uh... Central control room. OK...

652
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:55,312
- Uh, fourth floor. Fourth floor.
- Come on.

653
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:00,114
You take the right.

654
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,713
Oh, shit.

655
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,358
Shh.

656
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,151
- Can we stop for...
- Try to keep up.

657
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:13,277
I am! I just wanna stop for two seconds
to catch our breath.

658
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:16,636
You know, they have these things
called gymnasiums.

659
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:39,154
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

660
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:53,514
Intel's fairly certain the terrorists are mobile.

661
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:56,353
It's the only way
to avoid signal triangulation.

662
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,749
With the amount of hardware they're running,

663
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:03,311
we're probably looking for a large vehicle,
most likely a semitrailer rig.

664
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,994
All right. Tell the guys at Homeland Security

665
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:09,834
we need every agent, satellite
and functioning network they got. Now.

666
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,038
Play time's over, sweetheart.

667
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:31,235
Don't.

668
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:33,709
Take your hand off the gun. Hands up.

669
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:36,431
Stand up.

670
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:44,629
Go on. Now!

671
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:47,359
Let's go, kid. You're up.

672
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:49,032
OK...

673
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:52,118
As fast as you can.

674
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,109
Jesus!

675
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,231
That's enough of this kung fu shit.

676
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:18,552
I've known some bitches in my day,
but you are maybe the...

677
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:25,391
Still awake, huh?

678
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:27,630
- Just keep doin' what you're doin'.
- OK.

679
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:30,154
- How much time do you need?
- Um... Not much.

680
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:39,959
Whoo.

681
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,468
- Are you done?
- I, uh...

682
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:47,391
- Are you done?
- No, not quite.

683
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:50,358
- What?
- I'm not exactly checking my email here.

684
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:54,950
They used VM mode, so I'm isolating
their APl and booting the host.

685
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:58,271
- What?!
- It means about 30 seconds, OK?

686
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:00,635
Not the easiest thing to do when...

687
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,472
OK...

688
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:17,476
Undo everyhing you just did. Now!

689
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:19,676
OK. OK, OK.

690
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:24,439
I'm a righty, I'm a righty.
I need my other hand, I really do.

691
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:26,719
I'm a righty.

692
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:01,513
One last door to open.

693
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:05,434
Do you know what you're doing? Do you
realise what this'll do to the country?

694
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:09,433
Yes, I do. Now open the door.

695
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:12,910
OK, good. Glad we're on the same page.

696
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:21,873
You do? I'm glad you know.

697
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:38,957
How you doin'?

698
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,192
Hang on.

699
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:02,438
Listen, let's just talk about this
for one second.

700
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:09,752
How you doin'?
That's not too tight, is it?

701
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:14,517
Damn it!

702
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:18,356
Smile pretty!

703
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:51,829
McClane!

704
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:55,758
Shit.

705
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:58,828
McClane, get out of there!

706
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:02,110
Come on, man! Come on!

707
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:07,994
Come on, man.

708
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:28,878
Did you see that?

709
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:34,591
So you stopped it, right?

710
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:37,911
You know, a gun to your head
makes it harder to do this kind of work.

711
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,276
- What?
- I know that comes as a surprise.

712
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:47,316
- Can't you just turn it off? Lock 'em out?
- I'm not sure.

713
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:52,233
I might be able to slow 'em down, though.

714
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,118
Western and Central hubs are ours.
We're just waiting on Mai's end.

715
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:01,749
Hang on. Something's up.
All the security's reactivating.

716
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:07,715
I think someone might be in the market
for some cheap Viagra.

717
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:12,396
Now your girlfriend's dead,
why don't you check out our sexy singles?

718
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:14,838
It's an e-bomb.

719
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:22,918
Hey...

720
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,033
All right, wait, wait.

721
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:34,114
- Mai, talk to me. What's going on?
- Mai?

722
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:38,919
Oh, yeah - little Asian chick,
likes to kick people?

723
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,709
I don't think she's gonna be talking
to anybody for a really long time.

724
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:47,999
Last time I saw her, she was at the bottom
of an elevator shaft with an SUV up her ass.

725
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:51,752
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

726
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:55,230
Listen, jackass. Your fire sale is over.

727
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:01,278
Just pack up your little circus or I'm gonna
come and I'm gonna kick your ass.

728
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:07,230
You have no idea who I am
or what I'm capable of.

729
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:09,880
When I'm finished here -
and I promise it'll be soon -

730
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:13,589
I will focus all my attention... on you.

731
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:17,513
You wanna make things personal, fine.

732
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:41,993
Reroute every cubic foot of natural gas
in the pipelines to that station.

733
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:46,997
- Can you get Bowman on this thing?
- Sure. I can get anyone on it.

734
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:48,195
Do it.

735
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:50,077
- Now?
- Yeah, now.

736
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:55,437
Please, no.

737
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:58,237
- It's Thomas Gabriel.
- Shit.

738
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:02,997
- You know this guy?
- I worked with him.

739
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:06,470
He was DOD's chief programmer
for infrastructure security.

740
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:10,439
After 9/11, he's the guy that told
Joint Chiefs the system was vulnerable.

741
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:14,479
He wanted an overhaul, but they wouldn't
listen. Gabriel's not people-friendly.

742
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:16,118
You think so?

743
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:19,272
When he tried to go public,
they crucified him.

744
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:23,399
Destroyed his reputation, froze assets.
After that he disappeared.

745
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:25,789
We got a pretty serious problem.

746
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:27,950
Hold on one minute.
What?

747
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:31,919
I think we need to get out of here right now.

748
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,390
- They're sending the gas lines here.
- Gas lines? What gas lines?

749
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:37,072
Christ.

750
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:42,075
Oh... all of them. See that,
those flashing arrows? That's not good.

751
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:45,550
- All that's coming here?
- Yeah. I think we gotta go.

752
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:48,916
Listen, I gotta go. Just find Thomas Gabriel.

753
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,309
McClane? McClane?

754
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,630
Let's go. Finish this up.

755
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,231
Right now. Finish it up, come on! Let's go!

756
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,073
Get in there!

757
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:08,919
You OK?

758
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:16,399
- Let's go. We gotta get outta here.
- What is the point? Man, what is the point?

759
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,675
Hey, knock that off, come on.

760
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:24,118
This has something to do with that code you
wrote for them. Think. Come on, help us win.

761
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:27,795
Win? When do we start winning? Huh?

762
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:32,032
Look around. Are you out of your mind?
Does it look like we're close to winning?

763
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:34,509
We just got the shit kicked out of us!

764
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:36,591
You think I'm holding out on you?

765
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:40,514
If I knew what they wanted, I would tell you!
I would happily tell you!

766
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:42,878
Jesus.

767
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:20,518
The Warlock. The Warlock.

768
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:23,512
Oh, great. Ah! There goes the cellphone.

769
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:27,070
- They knocked satellites out of the skies?
- No, your battery ran out.

770
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:28,878
- We should go see him.
- Who?

771
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:31,633
The Warlock. We should drive
to his house in Baltimore.

772
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:35,349
- Can't go to the Warlock's house now.
- Hey! This is me helping you.

773
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:40,594
OK? Trust me. We gotta go see the Warlock.
That's our only hope.

774
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:48,639
- How do you feel about flying?
- Uh, about what? Like, with a pilot?

775
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:58,519
- Just stick it in the round thing.
- What brown thing?

776
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:01,273
Here, put these on.

777
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,828
Just stick it in there. That'll work.

778
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:07,754
- You OK?
- Uh, yeah, I'm just kind of afraid of flying.

779
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:10,195
- I used to be terrified of flying.
- Really?

780
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:13,590
Yeah. I took some lessons.
Face your fears, that kind of thing.

781
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:16,513
- Yeah? Did it help?
- Not really.

782
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:24,033
- Is it supposed to make that sound?
- Yeah.

783
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:29,912
- Maybe we should just drive.
- Take it easy. Taking offs the hardest part.

784
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,479
Really? I heard...

785
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:35,872
- To be honest, I missed a couple of classes.
- Ha, ha, ha! You did? Really?

786
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:40,192
But you have your licence, right?
I mean, you can fly one of these things?

787
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:43,716
- Oh, God.
- Hey-hey, here we go! We're up.

788
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:45,597
Oh, God.

789
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:52,473
That's good. That's pretty good.

790
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:56,678
Jesus, look at that.
This whole area's blacked out.

791
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:00,915
How we gonna find Warlock's house?

792
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:04,072
Um, it's probably gonna be
the one with the lights still on.

793
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:16,754
Power outage keeps spreading. About half
the East Coast has already gone down.

794
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:20,196
All right. Put everyhing
on emergency generators.

795
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:22,669
How the hell are they getting past us?

796
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:28,276
OK. Down there, down there. I see it.

797
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:29,998
- Down there?
- Left. Down.

798
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:36,598
What? Are we gonna land down there?

799
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,278
- All right, hang on.
- OK, OK. Ohhh!

800
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:44,992
Fence. Fence. Fence!

801
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:48,952
- Fence. Fence!
- I see it.

802
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:50,953
Watch...

803
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:53,997
Ow! Ohhh!

804
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:04,311
- Oh, Jesus.
- Come on.

805
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:07,710
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
"Taking offs the hardest part."

806
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:08,710
Let's go.

807
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:16,470
Now, there's something you need to know
about Warlock. He hates cops, OK?

808
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:19,711
So just let me do all the talking, OK?

809
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,991
Shit.

810
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:32,275
Hey, Mrs Kaludis.

811
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:33,952
Um, is Freddy home?

812
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:38,752
I'm Matt Farrell and this is, uh...

813
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,558
Billy.

814
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:45,350
We're friends from... Space Camp.
I went to Space Camp with Freddy.

815
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,677
Freddy!

816
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:51,320
- Freddy?
- You got company!

817
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:00,557
Frederick! Didn't you hear me?

818
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:02,596
All Baltimore heard you, Ma.

819
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:05,752
- Your friends are here.
- Friends? What the...?

820
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:10,239
Come on, Ma! How many times I gotta
tell you, don't bring people down here?

821
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:15,075
I can't see too good. Is that a young, bearded
Han Solo? You've lost so much weight!

822
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:18,277
No, I gained 30 pounds. Who is that?
Know what? Doesn't matter.

823
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:22,831
Dude, what are you doin' here? Cos of you,
I'm rocking five generators to stay online.

824
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:29,029
And since you're being hunted by assassins,
this visit is not a healthy use of my time.

825
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:31,918
And hey, don't touch that, all right?

826
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,675
CB radio?
A little low-tech for you guys, isn't it?

827
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:39,230
That, my friend, is an end-of-the-world
insurance system, OK?

828
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:42,676
So when the last microchip goes down,
I can contact whoever's there,

829
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:44,876
whether they be zombies or not.

830
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:49,033
- What'd you bring your dad here for?
- He's cool. He's into the gaming culture.

831
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:51,190
Nice poster.

832
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:57,392
- Oh, what? Like, you a big fan of the Fett?
- No. I was always more of a Star Wars guy.

833
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:00,674
- Star Wars guy. Who is this man?
- He's my...

834
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:03,069
Hey, dump truck. I'm not his dad.

835
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:07,039
- I'm a cop. How 'bout that?
- Oh. A cop. I'm sorry. Thank you.

836
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:09,350
Why'd you bring a cop
into my command centre?

837
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:12,477
Command centre! It's a basement.

838
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:14,869
- It's a command centre!
- I can explain.

839
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:18,669
Just tell us about Thomas Gabriel, all right?
That's why we came here.

840
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:20,751
Thomas Gabriel. I didn't know. Sorry.

841
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:23,070
Get out! I want you outta here, right now.

842
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:26,277
Hey, calm down. Just calm down, big boy!

843
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:28,669
You calm down! It's my house!

844
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:33,276
You're gonna tell me what I wanna know,
or I'll beat you to death in your own house.

845
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:51,318
Four years ago, the DOD recruits Thomas
Gabriel to be a cyberspook for 'em, OK?

846
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:53,436
First day on the job, tells his bosses

847
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:56,956
this nation's security infrastructure
is open to compromise.

848
01:20:57,040 --> 01:21:02,034
They say, "We'll take it under advisement."
But he don't ease up cos he is committed.

849
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:04,918
So he breaks into a meeting
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

850
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:09,710
and, with just a laptop, hacks into NORAD
and shuts down our defence network.

851
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:12,997
So they put a gun to the man's head
and forced him to stop the hack.

852
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:17,073
Thomas Gabriel's the guy who shut down
NORAD with a laptop just to prove a point.

853
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:19,799
- You think I'm scared of you?
- Tell us how to find him.

854
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:22,917
How do I know? He's a ghost, man.
He just fell off the grid.

855
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,116
- Another dead end. Come on.
- Wait.

856
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:28,476
Listen, Warlock,
a couple of weeks ago I wrote a...

857
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:33,953
A mutating algorithmic security code, that's
probably being used by Thomas Gabriel now.

858
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:37,237
No, we know that. Yes.
Can you tell us what he's using it for?

859
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:40,949
I don't know. I've been trying
to figure that out. Here, look.

860
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:44,077
The only security system in the country
that I can find

861
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:48,438
currently employing that template
is the Social Security Administration.

862
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:53,674
But they don't use it in the main facility. Look.
They use it in this building, in Woodlawn.

863
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:56,752
- Whoa. What the hell? God!
- I know, right?

864
01:21:56,840 --> 01:22:00,389
- What are you talkin' about?
- The power consumption's off the charts.

865
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:04,029
- It's hot. It's on fire.
- Why are there chilling towers?

866
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:05,439
Hello.

867
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,909
What's a chilling tower?

868
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,309
See what I've been dealing with?

869
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:13,836
Large server farms generate a lot of heat
and need to be cooled.

870
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:15,273
But why there?

871
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:19,990
I don't know what's in that building,
but it's not Social Security numbers.

872
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:30,229
I got a red flag over here!
Someone's hackin' into Woodlawn.

873
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:34,112
Honing in on the host server right now.

874
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,870
"Frederick Kaludis."

875
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:39,030
- Let's have a look at him.
- Fat bastard.

876
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,159
McClane.

877
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:49,472
- Where is his daughter?
- We just got a trace on her cell.

878
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:51,073
You'll love this.

879
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:57,674
All right. Let's get a better look at you.

880
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:11,117
- Freddy?
- What?

881
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:14,636
What the hell are you doing
dickin' around inside my network?

882
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:20,558
McCIane?

883
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:22,471
I thought I killed you already.

884
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,471
I get that sometimes.

885
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:30,870
- You think you can try to track where he is?
- Dude, yeah.

886
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:35,795
Detective, covering the camera with your
hand does not turn off the microphone.

887
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:42,956
Yeah, I know I'm not as smart as you guys
with all this computer shit,

888
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:46,555
but, hey, I'm still alive, ain't I?

889
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:52,713
I mean, you got to be runnin' out
of bad guys by now, right? Huh?

890
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:57,191
Gabriel?

891
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:01,951
Honestly, you can tell me.
How does that work?

892
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:06,636
You got some kind of service?
Some kinda 800 number? 1-800-HENCHMEN?

893
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:08,995
And I bet you're still on hold with,

894
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:14,393
"Can I get another dead Asian hooker bitch
over here right away?" Huh?

895
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:20,237
But seriously, all that kicking aside, that
skinny little ninja chick, she was smokin' hot.

896
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:23,471
One of those gotta be real hard
to come by, right?

897
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:27,075
- You're impressed with yourself, aren't you?
- I have my moments.

898
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:28,912
Yeah?

899
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:32,511
Is this one of them?

900
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:39,553
- Hello?
- Yes, this is Emergency Services.

901
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:41,392
- Thank God.
- Can she hear me?

902
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:45,029
My name is Lucy Gennero.
I'm stuck in here. My cell's not working.

903
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:47,839
Can she hear this?
Lucy, hang up that phone!

904
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:51,913
Yes, calm down, miss.
We know exactly where you are.

905
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,797
Everything is gonna be all right.

906
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:58,351
- Lucy, hang up the phone!
- John, I'm trying to have a conversation.

907
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,878
We're a bit overloaded tonight,
as you may imagine,

908
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:06,394
but I assure you
we're gonna get you out of there.

909
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:10,632
- Even if I have to come down there myself.
- Thank you.

910
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:14,156
In the meantime, is there anyone
we can contact for you?

911
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:15,878
Yeah.

912
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:18,790
My dad.

913
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:22,429
His name is John McClane.
He's a New York City cop.

914
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:29,030
We'll find him. Just hang in there, miss,
and we'll get to you... very soon.

915
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:32,471
Thank you.

916
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:38,110
Wow. That's a great girl you got there.
Can't wait to meet her.

917
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:41,028
What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?

918
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:43,111
Come on, John.

919
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:46,714
Make a joke.

920
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:49,712
Say somethin' funny.

921
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:57,750
Where...?
Where you goin'?

922
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:02,551
Hey! McClane! Hold on.
Where you goin'? What are you gonna do?

923
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:06,679
What do you think I'm gonna do? I'm gonna
go kill this guy and get my daughter.

924
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:10,673
- But she can be anywhere...
- Listen. It's gonna get messy. Stay here.

925
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:14,196
- I think I...
- Hey, I'm doing you a favour.

926
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:16,589
I wouldn't bet on me, all right?

927
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:18,591
I'll take it from here.

928
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:20,989
Thanks for your help.

929
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:31,314
I wouldn't bet on you either,
so I figured I'd lend a hand.

930
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:35,031
Buckle up.

931
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:02,075
FBl, ma'am. Jersey field office.

932
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:04,071
Mind if I see your ID?

933
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:06,151
Not at all.

934
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:17,115
My dad's a cop. Force of habit.

935
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:21,070
Your father sounds like a very smart man.

936
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:27,590
Kid, can you get Bowman?

937
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:29,671
Uh, yeah.

938
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,831
It's completely dead.

939
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:44,390
Gabriel must have shut down
all the satellite links. Shit.

940
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:51,829
I'm sorry about Lucy, man.

941
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:56,430
About all of it.

942
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:59,239
It was my fault you got into this.
This wasn't your fight.

943
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:00,958
You got nothin' to be sorry about.

944
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:08,718
- Let go of me, you bastard!
- This bitch is a handful.

945
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:16,755
Are you gonna be all right?

946
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:21,192
Hey! Behave or I will hurt you.

947
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:26,149
Oh, yeah? Let's step outside,
just you and me. We'll see who hurts who.

948
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:30,190
You really are his daughter.

949
01:28:30,280 --> 01:28:31,872
Tie her wrists.

950
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:40,990
Trey, Gabriel wants to see you.

951
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:43,514
- Is it that time already?
- Yeah.

952
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:46,079
OK.

953
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,639
I'll be back in a second.

954
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:56,111
No, no, no, please!

955
01:29:38,360 --> 01:29:42,194
We're showing a breach on an exterior vent.

956
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:48,589
Go take a look.

957
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:51,270
Don't be long. We're packing up soon.

958
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:05,989
Hey, McClane, do we have anything
resembling a plan?

959
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:08,036
Find Lucy and kill everybody else.

960
01:30:08,120 --> 01:30:11,829
No, I mean more like a plan.
Like, a way to do that.

961
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:15,871
Come on.

962
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:22,876
OK, according to the layout, the chilling
towers are kept on the bottom level.

963
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:29,151
I think mine's locked.

964
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:36,389
OK. Now it looks like
we're gettin' somewhere.

965
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:44,591
Uh...

966
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:51,994
OK, this looks like it controls the cooling
system for the mainframe, which should be...

967
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:54,831
If I can just hack in...

968
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:59,199
and trip the alarm, it might alert Bowman.

969
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:09,038
Someone set off the alarms.

970
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:13,079
Yes. Thank you, detective. I can hear that.
Find a way to turn it off.

971
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:19,036
What have you got?

972
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:23,396
We got a problem.
The alarms went off at Woodlawn.

973
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:26,471
It's gotta be him.

974
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:28,676
And what's Woodlawn?

975
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:36,553
It's NSA - a secure facility
outside of Baltimore.

976
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:41,191
It's a fail-safe we built after 9/11
to back up all financial information.

977
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:46,070
The moment networks were hit, all financial
data began downloading to those servers.

978
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:51,029
Banks, Wall Street, corporate records,
government funds - all of it.

979
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:54,795
Basically, a backup for
the accumulated wealth of America.

980
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:57,189
All in one location?

981
01:31:58,280 --> 01:31:59,872
What could Gabriel do with it?

982
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:03,748
If he could get in, he might try to transfer
the data to a portable hard drive.

983
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:09,472
Then he'd have access to those accounts from
anywhere. Siphon off billions for himself.

984
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:11,073
We couldn't trace it.

985
01:32:11,160 --> 01:32:16,837
Or, knowing him, he could erase it all
and send us all back to the Stone Age.

986
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:22,074
- Why the hell wasn't I told about this?
- Frankly, it's above your pay grade.

987
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:24,151
My pay grade?

988
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:31,758
How the hell did Gabriel find out about this
when even I didn't know about it?

989
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:35,756
He designed it.

990
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:38,958
It was his program.

991
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:44,114
He knew that hacking your system
last night would trigger the download.

992
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:45,713
That's brilliant.

993
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:49,509
You two geniuses, stay out of my way.

994
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:58,235
Let me see if I can get a floor plan
of this place.

995
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:00,637
Don't move!

996
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:03,154
You, get away from the bag. Now!

997
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:04,798
OK, OK.

998
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:07,030
We've been waiting for you.

999
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:10,991
Yeah? I've been waiting for you, too.

1000
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:38,952
McClane!

1001
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:41,673
McClane!

1002
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:45,519
Kid?

1003
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:46,989
Matt?

1004
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:48,149
Kid!

1005
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,116
Emerson.

1006
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,309
We have a problem in
one of the cooling towers.

1007
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:07,719
- Tower seven.
- Tower seven.

1008
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:09,074
Find out what's going on.

1009
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:11,310
Arrivo subito. OK.

1010
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:19,869
Sir?

1011
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:22,554
Get the HR team to stand by.
We need to get to Woodlawn.

1012
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:25,313
The roads out are blocked.
DC's in total gridlock.

1013
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:27,152
Then get us some helicopters.

1014
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:30,073
They were all pulled by the Pentagon
for search and rescue.

1015
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:33,994
Molina, find me
some goddamn helicopters immediately.

1016
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:37,438
Look, the Pentagon
has jets flying CAP over DC.

1017
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:40,353
Have them send one to Woodlawn
and keep an eye on things.

1018
01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:42,431
Let's go.

1019
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:55,111
Where's my daughter?

1020
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:57,509
Russo, check in.

1021
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:05,275
Yeah, I think Russo's on his way down
to meet your girlfriend, dickhead.

1022
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:08,591
Hold on a minute.
Looks like he's coming around.

1023
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:11,673
It's McClane! He's on the third floor!

1024
01:35:15,160 --> 01:35:18,277
Get all that? That's right.

1025
01:35:18,360 --> 01:35:21,830
I'm on the third floor.
But I'm coming to get you.

1026
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,389
Don't move now. I'll send a doctor.

1027
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:37,908
Kill this guy and I'll give you Mai's cut.

1028
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:41,192
Je vous rejoins.

1029
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:24,157
My algorithm.

1030
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:32,394
OK, please, God.

1031
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:34,796
Oh, please, God...

1032
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:12,830
Oh, Jesus, they're going after the money.

1033
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:37,198
You coming to get me, John?
Is that the plan?

1034
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:39,396
Yep, that's my plan.

1035
01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:42,711
What makes you think I won't put a bullet
in your daughter's head?

1036
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:45,951
- Cos you're scared of me.
- You think I'm afraid of you?

1037
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:49,791
Otherwise she'd be dead already.
You need a bargaining chip.

1038
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:59,119
Stop there! Hands up.

1039
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:01,555
If you kill me, you'll never get it open.

1040
01:38:01,640 --> 01:38:04,279
Eccoti qui, piccolo stronzo.

1041
01:38:04,360 --> 01:38:06,510
Move away. Move!

1042
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:17,353
You know, John, I feel like
we've gotten off on the wrong foot.

1043
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:20,876
And because of that,
you think I'm the bad guy.

1044
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:23,633
Nothing could be further from the truth.
I'm the good guy.

1045
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:27,076
I told them this could happen
if they didn't prepare.

1046
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:30,596
Did I get a thank-you?
No, I got crucified. But they wouldn't listen.

1047
01:38:30,680 --> 01:38:34,355
- You got their attention now, don't you?
- That's right.

1048
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:38,911
- I am doing the country a favour.
- By tearing it apart.

1049
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:43,915
Better me than some outsider.
Some religious nut-job bent on Armageddon.

1050
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,560
Nobody wants to see that happen.

1051
01:38:46,640 --> 01:38:52,636
Everyhing I've broken can be fixed
if the country is willing to pay for it.

1052
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:55,871
Ah, bullshit.
It's always been about the money.

1053
01:38:55,960 --> 01:38:59,999
What? I shouldn't get paid for my work?
I'm working my ass off here, John.

1054
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:03,595
Well, just sit tight, asshole.
I got a cheque for you.

1055
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:11,156
I can't talk to this guy. You talk to him,
see if you can get him to focus.

1056
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:12,229
Dad?

1057
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:17,076
Hi, baby.

1058
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:20,311
Now there are only five of them.

1059
01:39:21,800 --> 01:39:24,268
Hang on, Lucy. I'm comin'.

1060
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:37,550
Would somebody
please kill this son of a bitch?

1061
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,877
We have a problem.

1062
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:45,434
There's actually no problem.
I just got off on the wrong floor.

1063
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:49,951
This is a mess.

1064
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:55,839
Wow. I'm truly impressed, man.
Hacking every byte of financial data

1065
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:59,993
for the entire country'd take weeks
unless you eliminated the congestion.

1066
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:03,117
That's what this fire sale is about, isn't it?

1067
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:06,272
- That's brilliant.
- Yes, it is. Please be quiet.

1068
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:08,749
- Asshole.
- Who are you?

1069
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:10,839
Matt Farrell.

1070
01:40:11,640 --> 01:40:13,870
Lucy McClane.

1071
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:17,270
I thought your name was Gennero.
Lucy Gennero.

1072
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:19,078
Not today.

1073
01:40:19,160 --> 01:40:22,948
- Can you crack the code?
- Maybe. I mean, if I had enough time.

1074
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:25,190
That's encouraging.

1075
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:28,995
Take them with us.

1076
01:40:29,080 --> 01:40:31,116
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1077
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:36,239
Gabriel, Pentagon just sent
an F-35 towards us.

1078
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:38,311
Keep an eye on it.

1079
01:40:40,120 --> 01:40:43,032
Pulling down the "go" codes now.

1080
01:40:57,920 --> 01:41:01,469
You might wanna think about
what you want on your headstone, asshole.

1081
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:10,394
Christ. Goddamn hamster!

1082
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:12,393
There you go.

1083
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:14,835
Stay still, spider-boy!

1084
01:41:18,680 --> 01:41:20,398
That's right.

1085
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:50,032
Goddammit!

1086
01:41:58,840 --> 01:41:59,955
Oh, no!

1087
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:06,598
You probably shouldn't antagonise them,
since they have all the loaded guns.

1088
01:42:06,680 --> 01:42:10,912
Take a minute and dig deep for a bigger
set of balls, cos you're gonna need 'em.

1089
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:15,869
Wow. I know that tone. It's just weird
hearing it from someone... with hair.

1090
01:42:50,920 --> 01:42:52,035
Sir.

1091
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:53,917
ETA 15 minutes.

1092
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:19,989
There we go.

1093
01:43:46,040 --> 01:43:47,712
Fix it.

1094
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:50,997
Why? You're just gonna kill me if I fix it.
I know that.

1095
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:59,032
Oh, shit.

1096
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:04,829
I'm not gonna do it.

1097
01:44:08,440 --> 01:44:12,035
- Oh, no, no, no! Shit!
- Robinson is coming pretty fast.

1098
01:44:12,120 --> 01:44:14,190
- I'm sorry, what?
- Something's wrong.

1099
01:44:14,280 --> 01:44:16,236
Robinson is coming too fast.

1100
01:44:20,440 --> 01:44:22,317
It's not Robinson.

1101
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:24,311
That would be my dad.

1102
01:44:35,200 --> 01:44:37,236
Freddy?

1103
01:44:38,120 --> 01:44:39,838
Freddy?

1104
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:42,398
It's John McCIane.

1105
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:45,870
Look, I know you can hear me.
This is your frequency, right? 666.

1106
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:48,599
Come on, pick up the mic, Freddy.

1107
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:53,390
Nobody here by that name. Sorry.

1108
01:44:53,480 --> 01:44:55,471
Hacker jerk-off!

1109
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:01,316
Warlock...

1110
01:45:01,400 --> 01:45:06,428
I need you to do whatever it is you do
to patch me through to the FBl.

1111
01:45:06,520 --> 01:45:08,431
To Deputy Director Bowman.

1112
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:10,988
- You hear me?
- Are you serious?

1113
01:45:11,080 --> 01:45:13,514
You want me to intentionally
open up a com line

1114
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:17,229
to the head of the FBI's cyber division?
I don't think so.

1115
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:19,869
Freddy, goddammit,
they have my daughter!

1116
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,275
I can do that. Hold on.

1117
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:30,431
Thank you.

1118
01:45:36,360 --> 01:45:39,591
This is Central.
We have a patch for Director Bowman.

1119
01:45:40,040 --> 01:45:42,918
Sir. Central's trying to reach you.

1120
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:45,155
Go.

1121
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:47,595
- Bowman, it's McClane.
- McClane.

1122
01:45:47,680 --> 01:45:51,389
Listen to me. Gabriel is on the 695
headed north in a Hazmat truck.

1123
01:45:51,480 --> 01:45:55,268
Wait, Gabriel's left Woodlawn?
We're headed there right now.

1124
01:45:55,360 --> 01:45:58,432
Bowman. He's got my daughter.

1125
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:03,511
Listen, this Hazmat truck is a government
vehicle, so it should be LoJacked, right?

1126
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:05,716
Track that down, it should take you to him.

1127
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:09,190
- Give me the tag number.
- All right. Hang on. Here it comes.

1128
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:11,316
Golf... Tango...

1129
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:16,759
five... niner... two... November.

1130
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:19,354
Got it. McClane, where is Farrell?

1131
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:20,919
He's with them.

1132
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:23,193
Listen to me.

1133
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:27,558
I'm gonna go in there and get Lucy out,
but if something happens to me,

1134
01:46:27,640 --> 01:46:31,997
you gotta send the cavalry in, you hear me?
I mean everybody.

1135
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:34,150
Don't let that maniac get my daughter.

1136
01:46:34,240 --> 01:46:37,516
- John, don't worry.
- I want your word, Bowman.

1137
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:42,035
Yeah, you have it.

1138
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:43,838
McClane out.

1139
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:51,955
There's the F-35.

1140
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:56,675
Did you get the "go" codes?

1141
01:46:56,760 --> 01:46:59,069
- Trey. Did you get the "go" codes?
- Yes.

1142
01:46:59,160 --> 01:47:01,674
Can you connect me to the pilot?

1143
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:04,557
Uh...

1144
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:20,029
Isolating his radio.

1145
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:27,314
Sending him the "go" codes.

1146
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:34,434
AV-81.

1147
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:39,640
- AV-81, this is Marine Air Wing ATC.
- Go for AV-81.

1148
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:43,235
Confirmed terrorist vehicle
located in your sector. A big rig truck.

1149
01:47:44,640 --> 01:47:47,438
- Currently in pursuit of a Hazmat vehicle.
- I see them.

1150
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:50,159
You are authorised to engage and destroy.

1151
01:47:50,240 --> 01:47:52,595
Copy that. AV-81 engaging.

1152
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:01,629
What?

1153
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:12,237
Jesus Christ! Goddammit!

1154
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:17,037
You're shooting at the wrong guy!

1155
01:48:24,720 --> 01:48:26,950
I don't think Daddy's coming, honey.

1156
01:48:38,920 --> 01:48:41,070
Hey! Jackass!

1157
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:29,190
Is that it? Huh?

1158
01:49:32,040 --> 01:49:34,759
Is that your best shot?

1159
01:50:14,920 --> 01:50:16,399
Come on!

1160
01:50:24,600 --> 01:50:25,828
Damn!

1161
01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:43,278
Come on!

1162
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:08,231
Yaaarrhh...

1163
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:42,718
Whoo!

1164
01:52:12,920 --> 01:52:14,797
Let's go. Come on!

1165
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:16,871
That way. It's that way. Go!

1166
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:28,080
We are leaving in three minutes.

1167
01:52:31,200 --> 01:52:33,430
You have one.

1168
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:36,876
The rules haven't changed.
You'll kill me the minute I unlock it.

1169
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:39,590
Aaargh! Aaargh!

1170
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:43,028
- Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
- Matthew?

1171
01:52:43,120 --> 01:52:44,314
Matthew!

1172
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:47,119
I really need you to pay attention.

1173
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:50,795
- The rules can always change.
- OK, wait.

1174
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:53,155
- I'm gonna shoot her in ten seconds.
- Wait.

1175
01:52:53,240 --> 01:52:55,037
Nine.

1176
01:52:55,120 --> 01:52:56,633
I can't.

1177
01:52:56,720 --> 01:52:58,631
Eight.

1178
01:52:58,720 --> 01:53:00,438
I can't.

1179
01:53:01,200 --> 01:53:02,553
Oh, God.

1180
01:53:05,360 --> 01:53:08,272
OK!

1181
01:53:08,360 --> 01:53:09,759
OK, OK, OK!

1182
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:11,353
Six.

1183
01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:15,194
OK, stop! Stop, stop!
I'm doing it. I'm doing it!

1184
01:53:15,280 --> 01:53:17,794
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

1185
01:53:30,760 --> 01:53:33,035
Feds are headed this way.

1186
01:53:33,120 --> 01:53:35,634
- Get everyhing on the plane.
- Yep.

1187
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:46,277
- Dad!
- Careful.

1188
01:53:46,360 --> 01:53:49,716
Don't worry, baby.
Everyhing's gonna be all right.

1189
01:53:51,640 --> 01:53:53,596
Daddy!

1190
01:53:58,160 --> 01:54:00,116
No!

1191
01:54:00,200 --> 01:54:02,430
Hold this.

1192
01:54:17,480 --> 01:54:18,754
Aaargh!

1193
01:54:23,560 --> 01:54:25,312
No!

1194
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:28,630
Jesus Christ.

1195
01:54:28,720 --> 01:54:30,836
You got her?

1196
01:54:31,200 --> 01:54:33,031
You're sure?

1197
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:36,598
Nice effort, though.

1198
01:54:37,200 --> 01:54:40,158
- Matthew!
- Oh, shit! All right, OK!

1199
01:54:40,240 --> 01:54:41,992
OK! I'm doin' it. I know.

1200
01:54:49,560 --> 01:54:51,471
McClane.

1201
01:54:51,560 --> 01:54:54,358
Would you do me a favour?

1202
01:54:55,640 --> 01:55:00,395
I know the lights are beginning to dim,
but if you could just hang on for a second,

1203
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:03,552
when Matt's finished,
I'm gonna kill him and your daughter,

1204
01:55:03,640 --> 01:55:06,393
and I would love for you to see that.

1205
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:10,275
Goddammit. Matthew?

1206
01:55:10,360 --> 01:55:12,749
Ten seconds, OK?
You'll have all your money.

1207
01:55:12,840 --> 01:55:16,753
- You just leave. No one has to get hurt, OK?
- A few seconds. Stay with me.

1208
01:55:16,840 --> 01:55:18,831
McClane!

1209
01:55:18,920 --> 01:55:21,309
- Ohh!
- Stay with me.

1210
01:55:21,400 --> 01:55:22,879
Dad?

1211
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:27,988
On your tombstone it should read, "Always
in the wrong place at the wrong time."

1212
01:55:28,760 --> 01:55:32,548
How 'bout,
"Yippee-ki-yay, motherf...!"

1213
01:55:45,720 --> 01:55:48,314
Daddy... Daddy... Daddy...

1214
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:51,437
- Are you OK?
- Yes, baby, I'm fine.

1215
01:55:53,400 --> 01:55:54,879
I knew you'd come for me.

1216
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:59,476
Of course I'd come for you, honey.
Sorry it took me so long. It's OK.

1217
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:08,632
Move, move.

1218
01:56:13,480 --> 01:56:15,038
Freeze!

1219
01:56:15,120 --> 01:56:17,873
Hold, hold! He's OK.

1220
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:22,360
- Get that vehicle.
- Come around!

1221
01:56:22,440 --> 01:56:24,476
- Here, help Daddy up.
- OK.

1222
01:56:24,560 --> 01:56:29,076
Oooh! Wait, wait.
I think I'll just stay here for a minute.

1223
01:56:29,160 --> 01:56:33,119
- OK. Daddy, you're outta your mind.
- What are you talkin' about?

1224
01:56:33,200 --> 01:56:37,830
- You shot yourself!
- It seemed like a good idea at the time.

1225
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:40,912
Don't tell these guys that I did that.

1226
01:56:51,800 --> 01:56:54,473
- Thanks for all your help, John.
- Thank you.

1227
01:56:56,360 --> 01:56:58,237
Is he OK?

1228
01:56:59,240 --> 01:57:01,959
- Should I put my hands up?
- No, don't put your hands up.

1229
01:57:02,040 --> 01:57:04,270
Put 'em down further?

1230
01:57:04,360 --> 01:57:08,512
Might die of shock on the way to the hospital.

1231
01:57:11,120 --> 01:57:12,758
All right.

1232
01:57:14,840 --> 01:57:16,671
I'll be right back.

1233
01:57:18,320 --> 01:57:20,390
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

1234
01:57:20,480 --> 01:57:22,994
- How's it feel to be shot?
- It actually feels great.

1235
01:57:23,080 --> 01:57:26,356
He gave me some...
What's it called? Mor...? Morphine.

1236
01:57:26,440 --> 01:57:31,878
- Well, you got your merit badge now.
- Yeah. I don't know what that means.

1237
01:57:31,960 --> 01:57:35,794
- Plus, you know, chicks dig scars.
- Really? Hm.

1238
01:57:37,240 --> 01:57:39,151
Not that one.

1239
01:57:39,240 --> 01:57:40,958
- What?
- Don't even think about it.

1240
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:44,635
How did you know what I was thinking?
Did she say something to you?

1241
01:57:44,720 --> 01:57:49,077
- I felt like we had kind of a vibe.
- Easy. That's just the morphine kickin' in.

1242
01:57:49,160 --> 01:57:50,513
Yeah.

1243
01:57:50,600 --> 01:57:55,469
Besides, after all we've been through,
I'd hate to have to beat you to death.

1244
01:57:57,160 --> 01:57:59,071
That would suck.

1245
01:58:00,600 --> 01:58:02,352
- Good to go?
- Yeah, all set.

1246
01:58:02,440 --> 01:58:05,989
Take care of yourself.
I'll see you at the hospital.

1247
01:58:09,720 --> 01:58:11,472
Hey.

1248
01:58:12,360 --> 01:58:16,592
- Thanks for saving my daughter's life.
- Hey...

1249
01:58:16,680 --> 01:58:18,955
What was I gonna do?

1250
01:58:20,360 --> 01:58:22,430
That's what makes you that guy.

1251
01:58:25,320 --> 01:58:27,515
Yeah.

1252
01:58:32,760 --> 01:58:35,513
So, um, did he say anything about me?

1253
01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:39,316
Jesus, Lucy.

1254
01:58:39,400 --> 01:58:41,516
What? I'm sorry. I'm just asking.

1255
01:58:42,960 --> 01:58:45,269
I'm in enough pain already.

1256
01:58:45,360 --> 01:58:47,157
Hospital.
