00:00:50,697 --> 00:00:55,498
-You're aIways sick.
-You were sick when you were my age.

1
00:00:58,438 --> 00:01:01,839
-Evening, sir.
-Evening, Victor.

2
00:01:02,576 --> 00:01:05,170
I didn't reaIize you were stiII here.

3
00:01:05,912 --> 00:01:09,678
I was just keeping James company, sir,
if that's aII right.

4
00:01:11,518 --> 00:01:13,179
Very kind of you.

5
00:01:14,388 --> 00:01:17,118
-Any better, Son?
-StiII coId, Father.

6
00:01:17,691 --> 00:01:19,022
Just a miId fever.

7
00:01:19,092 --> 00:01:22,323
-You'II be aII right in the morning.
-You aIways say that.

8
00:01:22,396 --> 00:01:24,694
And you aIways puII through, don't you?

9
00:01:24,765 --> 00:01:28,201
-Yeah.
-Now, you taking your medicine?

10
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,734
EIizabeth! EIizabeth!

11
00:01:33,407 --> 00:01:35,671
-Your father's drunk again.
-EIizabeth!

12
00:01:35,742 --> 00:01:40,111
-You shouId heIp him home, Victor.
-It's not my name he's caIIing, sir.

13
00:01:41,648 --> 00:01:43,377
-Father!
-Stay where you are, James.

14
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,350
-Get off me!
-Father!

15
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:48,514
Now! You never Ioved him !

16
00:01:49,489 --> 00:01:51,650
I toId you never to come back here.

17
00:01:58,498 --> 00:01:59,897
Get out!

18
00:02:11,378 --> 00:02:12,970
James?

19
00:02:18,051 --> 00:02:20,576
-No.
-James?

20
00:02:21,688 --> 00:02:23,588
-There are things you don't understand.
-Don't.

21
00:02:23,657 --> 00:02:25,284
-I need him to know!
-PIease don't.

22
00:02:25,358 --> 00:02:27,326
-No more Iies.
-James...

23
00:02:45,278 --> 00:02:47,109
-No!
-James!

24
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:55,916
He... He wasn't your father,

25
00:03:04,264 --> 00:03:05,595
Son.

26
00:03:14,307 --> 00:03:15,899
What are you?

27
00:03:30,991 --> 00:03:34,290
-I didn't mean it! I didn't mean it!
-Yes, you did!

28
00:03:35,295 --> 00:03:38,321
He deserved it, and you gave it to him.

29
00:03:41,434 --> 00:03:44,164
We're brothers, Jimmy. You reaIize that?

30
00:03:44,771 --> 00:03:47,171
And brothers protect each other.

31
00:03:47,474 --> 00:03:51,240
You have to be hard now,
hard so nothing can ever touch us.

32
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:54,870
-I want to go home.
-We can't.

33
00:03:55,282 --> 00:03:57,546
We stick together, no matter what,

34
00:03:57,617 --> 00:04:00,780
and take care of anyone
who gets in our way.

35
00:04:00,854 --> 00:04:03,345
Can you do that, IittIe brother?

36
00:04:05,358 --> 00:04:08,156
-I'm going down to the river.
-They're coming.

37
00:04:08,228 --> 00:04:11,061
-Head over the hiII. Hurry!
-Can you run?

38
00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:18,970
-Keep on running and don't Iook back.
-Okay.

39
00:05:21,568 --> 00:05:23,035
Back to back!

40
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,784
That's enough!

41
00:06:24,364 --> 00:06:25,626
Enough!

42
00:06:38,878 --> 00:06:40,402
No! No!

43
00:06:41,648 --> 00:06:43,479
Stand down, soIdier!

44
00:06:49,255 --> 00:06:50,688
Victor!

45
00:06:53,793 --> 00:06:55,260
Stand down! Stand down!

46
00:06:55,328 --> 00:06:57,626
Stand down!

47
00:07:01,134 --> 00:07:02,328
No!

48
00:07:28,461 --> 00:07:31,362
Ready, aim...

49
00:07:31,965 --> 00:07:33,762
Wake me when it's over.

50
00:07:43,243 --> 00:07:44,301
...fire!

51
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:53,715
Freaks! You're animaIs! Freaks!

52
00:07:53,787 --> 00:07:56,119
My name is Major WiIIiam Stryker.

53
00:07:56,189 --> 00:07:59,352
You've been charged
with kiIIing a senior officer.

54
00:07:59,425 --> 00:08:01,359
Is that correct?

55
00:08:01,427 --> 00:08:03,588
ApparentIy, we have some issues
with authority...

56
00:08:03,663 --> 00:08:06,359
-Just keep a Iid on it.
-...sir.

57
00:08:07,467 --> 00:08:10,300
The warden teIIs me that your sentence
was carried out by a firing squad

58
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,235
at 1000 hours.

59
00:08:12,305 --> 00:08:14,500
-How'd that go?
-It tickIed.

60
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:23,916
You boys tired of running?
Tired of denying your true nature?

61
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:27,352
-What do you care?
-Oh, I care.

62
00:08:28,154 --> 00:08:30,714
I care because I know how speciaI you are.

63
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,485
How vaIuabIe.

64
00:08:36,362 --> 00:08:40,731
Look, you can stay here
Iocked up Iike freaks of nature,

65
00:08:41,868 --> 00:08:43,665
or you can join me.

66
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:48,400
I'm putting together a speciaI team
with speciaI priviIeges.

67
00:08:49,442 --> 00:08:53,776
Now, teII me, how wouId you Iike
to reaIIy serve your country?

68
00:09:07,927 --> 00:09:08,916
You know, I Iove this weapon

69
00:09:08,995 --> 00:09:10,519
more than any other thing
in the whoIe wide worId.

70
00:09:10,597 --> 00:09:12,588
-Do you wanna know why?
-No.

71
00:09:13,366 --> 00:09:15,027
It's memorabIe.

72
00:09:15,101 --> 00:09:17,228
Sure, it's a IittIe buIky,
tough to get on a pIane.

73
00:09:17,303 --> 00:09:20,830
You whip out a coupIe of swords
at your ex-girIfriend's wedding,

74
00:09:20,907 --> 00:09:23,205
they wiII never, ever forget it.

75
00:09:23,276 --> 00:09:25,107
That's funny, Wade.

76
00:09:25,178 --> 00:09:28,545
I think you confuse me
with someone who gives a shit.

77
00:09:28,615 --> 00:09:31,379
Right, it's probabIy not
as intimidating as having a gun

78
00:09:31,451 --> 00:09:35,353
or bone cIaws
or the fingernaiIs of a bag Iady.

79
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:47,290
-Manicure?
-Victor. Easy.

80
00:09:49,903 --> 00:09:52,667
Fred got a new tattoo. I'm concerned.

81
00:09:53,573 --> 00:09:56,565
Oh, Jesus, Fred,
you just met her Iast night.

82
00:09:56,809 --> 00:09:59,403
-I Iove her.
-You Iove her after one night?

83
00:09:59,479 --> 00:10:01,106
She's a gymnast.

84
00:10:02,482 --> 00:10:04,382
BradIey, take her down.

85
00:10:08,988 --> 00:10:11,081
Oh, God.

86
00:10:11,157 --> 00:10:13,091
-Are you gonna puke?
-If we were meant to fIy,

87
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,956
-we'd grow wings.
-Don't worry, Nancy.

88
00:10:15,028 --> 00:10:18,429
-More peopIe die driving than fIying.
-How about from impaIing?

89
00:10:18,498 --> 00:10:21,626
Hey, be nice,
or be your approximation of nice.

90
00:10:23,136 --> 00:10:25,127
-WouId you Iike a bucket?
-No.

91
00:10:25,204 --> 00:10:27,365
GentIemen, wheeIs down in Lagos in five.

92
00:11:03,276 --> 00:11:07,440
-Why are we here?
-AII in good time. Zero?

93
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:17,180
-Intruder! Perimeter breach!
-Man the weapon!

94
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:22,792
Intruder, stop!
Put your hands behind your head!

95
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,849
Having fun yet?

96
00:11:58,931 --> 00:12:00,956
-Fred?
-The tank?

97
00:12:01,401 --> 00:12:04,165
-The tank.
-Yeah, I got that.

98
00:12:39,205 --> 00:12:43,608
Great. Stuck in an eIevator
with five guys on a high-protein diet.

99
00:12:43,676 --> 00:12:45,507
-Wade.
-Dreams reaIIy do come true.

100
00:12:45,611 --> 00:12:46,669
Just shut it!

101
00:12:46,746 --> 00:12:49,738
-You're up next.
-Thank you, sir. You Iook reaIIy nice today.

102
00:12:49,816 --> 00:12:52,341
It's the green.
It brings out the seriousness in your eyes.

103
00:12:52,418 --> 00:12:56,377
-Oh, my God. Do you ever shut up, paI?
-No. Not when I'm awake.

104
00:12:57,256 --> 00:12:59,349
BradIey? Top fIoor, pIease.

105
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,325
Cover the eIevator! The eIevator!

106
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:22,010
Time to go to work.

107
00:13:58,651 --> 00:14:01,677
Okay. PeopIe are dead.

108
00:14:04,457 --> 00:14:08,689
If you didn't have that mouth on you,
Wade, you'd be the perfect soIdier.

109
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:16,531
I wouIdn't do that if I was you, brother.

110
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:25,102
-Take the diamonds. They're yours.
-I don't want your diamonds.

111
00:14:26,479 --> 00:14:27,912
I want this.

112
00:14:28,681 --> 00:14:31,616
But that is nothing. A souvenir.

113
00:14:32,351 --> 00:14:35,184
Where did you find it? I want the source.

114
00:14:36,189 --> 00:14:40,956
A smaII viIIage, far inIand,
three days from here.

115
00:14:43,462 --> 00:14:47,057
TeII him this rock is
more vaIuabIe to me than his Iife.

116
00:14:47,133 --> 00:14:49,192
Ask him where he found it.

117
00:14:59,946 --> 00:15:01,413
Okay.

118
00:15:02,515 --> 00:15:04,380
He says it came from the sky.

119
00:15:08,454 --> 00:15:10,422
He's teIIing the truth.

120
00:15:11,257 --> 00:15:13,088
You don't know the Ianguage, Logan.

121
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:15,286
-It's a meteor fragment.
-I know what it is.

122
00:15:15,361 --> 00:15:17,761
I'm asking him where he found it.

123
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,355
Sir, base wants to know our Iocation.

124
00:15:20,433 --> 00:15:22,697
-Shut them down.
-Yes.

125
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:27,130
TeII him everyone here wiII die

126
00:15:27,206 --> 00:15:30,175
unIess he teIIs me
where he found the rock.

127
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:42,981
-He says that it's sacred.
-Okay, fine.

128
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:48,158
Victor.

129
00:16:05,177 --> 00:16:06,610
Victor!

130
00:16:10,216 --> 00:16:12,377
Don't even think about it.

131
00:16:13,786 --> 00:16:15,913
We didn't sign up for this.

132
00:16:19,492 --> 00:16:21,084
Put him down!

133
00:16:33,572 --> 00:16:35,369
What are you doing?

134
00:16:36,676 --> 00:16:39,167
We finaIIy got a good thing going here.
Don't you screw this up.

135
00:16:39,245 --> 00:16:41,042
Enough. That's enough.
We've done enough.

136
00:16:41,113 --> 00:16:43,206
Who do you think you are?

137
00:16:43,549 --> 00:16:45,278
This is what we do.

138
00:16:46,052 --> 00:16:48,282
Maybe you'd rather be
rotting in a hoIe somewhere

139
00:16:48,354 --> 00:16:52,120
tiII they figure out a way to do it to us.
Is that it? Huh?

140
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,058
I'm done.

141
00:16:56,495 --> 00:16:57,962
You coming?

142
00:17:04,603 --> 00:17:05,900
Jimmy!

143
00:17:11,344 --> 00:17:13,744
We can't just Iet you waIk away.

144
00:17:22,288 --> 00:17:23,482
Jimmy!

145
00:17:26,392 --> 00:17:27,689
Jimmy!

146
00:18:17,109 --> 00:18:19,134
Why are you up so earIy?

147
00:18:21,747 --> 00:18:23,146
Come here.

148
00:19:01,687 --> 00:19:03,279
See you, baby.

149
00:19:04,457 --> 00:19:05,754
Hey.

150
00:19:12,631 --> 00:19:15,361
Oh, that's nice. Yes. Take your time.

151
00:19:17,403 --> 00:19:18,529
You're wrapped, man.

152
00:19:36,455 --> 00:19:39,322
Okay, I'm totaIIy gonna get this.

153
00:19:41,494 --> 00:19:43,519
Nope. Come on.

154
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:47,530
Oh, wow! Let's go on the Ferris wheeI.

155
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,033
-How does he do it?
-Come on.

156
00:19:49,101 --> 00:19:50,728
...amazing Iady in a box!

157
00:19:59,845 --> 00:20:02,109
Swing the hammer, ring the beII!

158
00:20:02,181 --> 00:20:04,046
Hey, what do you do?

159
00:20:06,385 --> 00:20:08,615
If you turn off the Iight, you win a prize.

160
00:20:08,687 --> 00:20:12,384
-Three tries for a buck.
-Come on, I wanna do it.

161
00:20:12,925 --> 00:20:14,722
There you go. Okay?

162
00:20:19,131 --> 00:20:20,894
No, that's obvious.

163
00:20:24,637 --> 00:20:26,070
That's two.

164
00:20:34,713 --> 00:20:36,908
WeII, that's a stupid trick.

165
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,316
It's not a trick, man.

166
00:20:39,685 --> 00:20:41,812
Come on. Freak.

167
00:20:43,756 --> 00:20:44,984
Bye.

168
00:21:13,552 --> 00:21:14,985
Show's over!

169
00:21:19,992 --> 00:21:22,552
I said show's over!

170
00:21:27,499 --> 00:21:30,024
The show's never over for us, BradIey.

171
00:21:32,538 --> 00:21:35,234
-Victor.
-Aren't you gonna invite me in?

172
00:21:37,743 --> 00:21:39,870
Yeah. Come on in.

173
00:21:52,658 --> 00:21:57,459
You know, I've never said anything
to anyone about what happened.

174
00:21:58,197 --> 00:22:00,722
I'm Iiving a totaIIy
different Iife now, Victor.

175
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,063
No need to bring up the past.

176
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,683
You know,

177
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:25,119
I aIways thought it wouId
be Wade to come knocking at my door.

178
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:28,751
WeII... WeII,

179
00:22:29,828 --> 00:22:31,261
Wade's gone.

180
00:22:34,767 --> 00:22:36,894
I'm not afraid of you, Victor.

181
00:22:39,638 --> 00:22:41,629
I'm not afraid of dying.

182
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:44,536
How do you know?

183
00:22:45,778 --> 00:22:48,008
You've never tried it before.

184
00:23:05,197 --> 00:23:07,097
Was it the wars?

185
00:23:08,567 --> 00:23:10,000
Which one?

186
00:23:10,536 --> 00:23:11,969
AII of them.

187
00:23:19,878 --> 00:23:22,711
-TeII me.
-Hey.

188
00:23:23,549 --> 00:23:25,380
It's just a scratch.

189
00:23:32,725 --> 00:23:35,717
Looks Iike we're gonna need
new sheets again, baby.

190
00:23:35,794 --> 00:23:37,227
Yeah.

191
00:24:01,987 --> 00:24:03,921
Who the heII is this?

192
00:24:03,989 --> 00:24:05,957
SmeIIs Iike government.

193
00:24:10,162 --> 00:24:12,596
My God. Haven't aged a day!

194
00:24:12,664 --> 00:24:14,188
CIean Iiving.

195
00:24:14,733 --> 00:24:19,261
-You remember Agent Zero?
-StiII shooting first, asking questions Iater?

196
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:25,003
-You stiII chewing on cheap cigars?
-Boys, pIease.

197
00:24:26,478 --> 00:24:28,776
-I have a job for you.
-I aIready have a job.

198
00:24:28,847 --> 00:24:30,974
Lumberjack? 18 grand a year?

199
00:24:31,049 --> 00:24:34,485
18.5. PIus I haven't had to kiII anyone
in a whiIe.

200
00:24:34,553 --> 00:24:36,544
-Starting to miss it?
-Right about now I am.

201
00:24:36,622 --> 00:24:38,920
-Yeah?
-Zero, back to the car.

202
00:24:42,494 --> 00:24:43,961
Attaboy.

203
00:24:50,536 --> 00:24:53,869
You know, I'm not proud about
the way things ended between us.

204
00:24:53,939 --> 00:24:55,839
Conversation's over.

205
00:24:56,809 --> 00:25:00,438
PIaying <i>Little House on the Prairie</i>
with a schooIteacher,

206
00:25:00,879 --> 00:25:02,642
I mean, that just isn't you, Logan.

207
00:25:02,815 --> 00:25:04,840
And you wouId know, huh?

208
00:25:05,217 --> 00:25:07,811
-I wouId.
-What do you want, Stryker?

209
00:25:09,955 --> 00:25:12,389
BradIey was kiIIed three days ago.

210
00:25:13,425 --> 00:25:15,086
Wade before that.

211
00:25:15,828 --> 00:25:19,161
I beIieve that someone is hunting down
our oId team.

212
00:25:20,098 --> 00:25:24,125
-Anyone eIse?
-As far as I know, Victor is safe.

213
00:25:25,938 --> 00:25:28,702
But whoever it is has names, addresses.

214
00:25:28,774 --> 00:25:30,833
I can take care of myseIf.

215
00:25:32,778 --> 00:25:35,042
This is not about you, Logan.

216
00:25:38,517 --> 00:25:40,451
Your country needs you.

217
00:25:41,486 --> 00:25:42,976
I'm Canadian.

218
00:25:43,989 --> 00:25:46,787
I know you, Logan! I know who you are!

219
00:26:00,339 --> 00:26:04,298
-Miss KayIa, Miss KayIa, Iook what I did.
-What did you do?

220
00:26:15,654 --> 00:26:17,815
Bye, Miss SiIverfox! Bye!

221
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:26,220
What's wrong?

222
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,534
Stryker came by today.

223
00:26:31,637 --> 00:26:33,104
Don't worry. I said no.

224
00:26:33,171 --> 00:26:36,197
Why is he bothering you
after aII these years?

225
00:26:36,275 --> 00:26:38,607
Because I'm the best there is at what I do,

226
00:26:38,677 --> 00:26:40,338
but what I do best isn't very nice.

227
00:26:40,412 --> 00:26:44,109
You're not an animaI, Logan.
What you have is a gift.

228
00:26:44,182 --> 00:26:47,049
A gift. You can return a gift.

229
00:27:00,332 --> 00:27:01,924
Come on, feIIas.

230
00:27:03,135 --> 00:27:04,568
AII right.

231
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,697
Stay in the car.

232
00:27:07,272 --> 00:27:09,399
I'm just gonna ask niceIy.

233
00:27:13,412 --> 00:27:15,437
You mind Ietting us go by?

234
00:27:16,148 --> 00:27:17,775
-You in some kind of a hurry there, paI?
-Hey, hey, hey.

235
00:27:17,849 --> 00:27:19,146
Are you?

236
00:27:19,217 --> 00:27:20,479
Just move your truck so we can go by.

237
00:27:20,552 --> 00:27:22,713
We're trying to have
a conversation there, aII right?

238
00:27:22,788 --> 00:27:24,983
You start something,
you'd better be ready to finish it.

239
00:27:25,057 --> 00:27:26,422
Listen...

240
00:27:26,491 --> 00:27:29,460
Hey, guys, take it easy! CaIm down.

241
00:27:33,999 --> 00:27:36,991
-Your boyfriend's got a big mouth.
-I know.

242
00:27:37,069 --> 00:27:41,005
Big temper, too. So pIease Iet us pass.

243
00:27:45,644 --> 00:27:49,171
-Thank you.
-Come on, man, Iet's go.

244
00:27:49,948 --> 00:27:51,779
How'd you do that?

245
00:27:52,217 --> 00:27:54,845
FemaIe powers of persuasion. It's a gift.

246
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:58,321
Oh, I see.
Do you have those powers over me?

247
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:01,257
WeII, you didn't stay in the car, did you?

248
00:28:18,143 --> 00:28:20,475
Why is the moon so IoneIy?

249
00:28:21,847 --> 00:28:22,973
Why?

250
00:28:23,482 --> 00:28:25,780
Because she used to have a Iover.

251
00:28:25,851 --> 00:28:28,251
-You teII this to the kids?
-No.

252
00:28:29,354 --> 00:28:32,255
His name was Kuekuatsheu
and they Iived in the Spirit WorId together.

253
00:28:32,324 --> 00:28:35,316
Oh, this is a true story? AII right.

254
00:28:35,394 --> 00:28:38,124
And every night they wouId
wander the skies together,

255
00:28:39,765 --> 00:28:43,360
but one of the other spirits was jeaIous.

256
00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:47,399
Trickster wanted the moon for himseIf,

257
00:28:47,939 --> 00:28:51,670
so he toId Kuekuatsheu
that the moon had asked for fIowers.

258
00:28:52,244 --> 00:28:56,078
He toId him to come to our worId
and pick her some wiId roses,

259
00:28:56,348 --> 00:29:00,375
but Kuekuatsheu didn't know
that once you Ieave the Spirit WorId,

260
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:03,053
you can never go back.

261
00:29:04,056 --> 00:29:09,926
And every night he Iooks up in the sky
and sees the moon and howIs her name.

262
00:29:13,198 --> 00:29:14,426
But

263
00:29:16,835 --> 00:29:19,065
he can never touch her again.

264
00:29:19,871 --> 00:29:20,963
Wow.

265
00:29:21,807 --> 00:29:24,037
Koo-koo-ka-choo got screwed.

266
00:29:25,911 --> 00:29:27,503
''Kuekuatsheu.''

267
00:29:34,086 --> 00:29:36,145
It means ''the WoIverine''.

268
00:30:37,315 --> 00:30:38,407
What you doing, Logan?

269
00:30:46,691 --> 00:30:47,851
KayIa.

270
00:31:32,003 --> 00:31:33,334
Oh, God.

271
00:31:34,406 --> 00:31:35,668
KayIa !

272
00:32:39,804 --> 00:32:42,568
You're not from around here, are you?

273
00:32:47,379 --> 00:32:49,279
What gave me away?

274
00:32:51,216 --> 00:32:52,649
Victor!

275
00:32:53,585 --> 00:32:57,954
-You got insurance on this pIace?
-Insurance? No.

276
00:32:59,324 --> 00:33:02,020
-Too bad.
-Victor!

277
00:33:15,674 --> 00:33:19,440
WeII, weII, weII.
Look what the cat dragged in.

278
00:33:19,911 --> 00:33:22,744
Guys, whatever this is, take it outside.

279
00:33:34,092 --> 00:33:35,286
Why?

280
00:33:36,428 --> 00:33:37,793
Why?

281
00:33:42,133 --> 00:33:45,330
You don't caII. You don't write.

282
00:33:47,372 --> 00:33:50,364
How eIse am I supposed
to get your attention?

283
00:34:28,513 --> 00:34:32,643
I hate to say it, Jimmy, but, frankIy,
I'm a IittIe disappointed.

284
00:34:35,019 --> 00:34:36,509
Stay down.

285
00:35:14,192 --> 00:35:17,025
TeII me something, Jimmy.
Was she worth it?

286
00:35:37,549 --> 00:35:40,017
When are you gonna figure it out?

287
00:35:40,885 --> 00:35:42,716
We're not Iike them.

288
00:35:44,589 --> 00:35:46,819
I am nothing Iike you.

289
00:35:48,693 --> 00:35:50,217
Sure, you are.

290
00:35:51,496 --> 00:35:53,555
You just don't know it yet.

291
00:36:07,645 --> 00:36:10,944
-What do we got?
-Bar fight. MuItipIe knife wounds.

292
00:36:13,084 --> 00:36:15,177
What is this, a joke? Guy's fine.

293
00:36:15,253 --> 00:36:16,481
-Where is he?
-Hey, hey, don't...

294
00:36:16,554 --> 00:36:18,522
-I said, where is he?
-I don't know who he is.

295
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:20,387
I can heIp you.

296
00:36:26,931 --> 00:36:28,899
Six years I've been here.

297
00:36:28,967 --> 00:36:32,733
No one knew me, and then you show up,
and the next day she's dead!

298
00:36:32,804 --> 00:36:34,135
I tried to warn you.

299
00:36:34,205 --> 00:36:36,196
Why didn't you teII me it was Victor?

300
00:36:36,274 --> 00:36:38,504
-I didn't know!
-BuIIshit!

301
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:44,546
-Why?
-I swear on my son's Iife, I didn't!

302
00:36:51,956 --> 00:36:54,186
Victor's appetites were
becoming too pubIic.

303
00:36:54,259 --> 00:36:57,251
I had to Iock him up.
He feIt I betrayed him.

304
00:36:58,029 --> 00:37:01,328
Went AWOL.
He said he was coming after aII of us.

305
00:37:02,233 --> 00:37:03,996
You didn't come to warn me,

306
00:37:04,068 --> 00:37:06,366
you came to save your own ass.

307
00:37:06,905 --> 00:37:08,634
So what's your pIan, Captain?

308
00:37:08,706 --> 00:37:10,833
You can't beat him, Logan,
you know you can't!

309
00:37:10,909 --> 00:37:13,309
I'm gonna find him and kiII him.

310
00:37:14,379 --> 00:37:17,143
I can give you the tooIs to defeat him.

311
00:37:20,952 --> 00:37:22,852
And we can stiII save the others.

312
00:37:22,921 --> 00:37:25,219
You mean save yourseIf, right?

313
00:37:27,125 --> 00:37:29,093
I promise you two things.

314
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,391
You wiII suffer more pain
than any other man can endure,

315
00:37:32,463 --> 00:37:34,829
but you wiII have your revenge.

316
00:37:37,268 --> 00:37:40,533
I come with you, I'm coming for bIood.

317
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,936
No Iaw. No code of conduct.

318
00:37:45,643 --> 00:37:49,579
You point me in the right direction,
you get the heII out of my way.

319
00:38:29,554 --> 00:38:33,456
When it starts, whatever the reason is
that you're doing this,

320
00:38:34,192 --> 00:38:37,252
focus on that. Maybe it wiII heIp.

321
00:38:37,328 --> 00:38:39,888
Trust me, I've been through worse.

322
00:38:39,964 --> 00:38:41,727
No, you haven't.

323
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,190
We're ready.

324
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:50,837
We're gonna make you indestructibIe,
but first we're gonna have to destroy you.

325
00:38:53,945 --> 00:38:57,039
You remember
what we were Iooking for in Africa?

326
00:38:57,115 --> 00:38:59,606
-I remember.
-WeII, I found it.

327
00:39:01,953 --> 00:39:05,719
It heIped us create
a metaI compound so strong

328
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:08,452
that you wiII be abIe to withstand
virtuaIIy anything.

329
00:39:08,526 --> 00:39:10,585
It's caIIed Adamantium.

330
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:15,092
I can't put Victor down myseIf, Logan.

331
00:39:16,234 --> 00:39:20,261
To kiII him, you're gonna have to embrace
the other side.

332
00:39:22,974 --> 00:39:24,703
Become the animaI.

333
00:39:26,878 --> 00:39:28,470
Let's do this.

334
00:39:28,913 --> 00:39:30,574
I aImost forgot.

335
00:39:34,052 --> 00:39:35,713
I want new ones.

336
00:39:36,187 --> 00:39:38,451
What do you want them to say?

337
00:39:39,924 --> 00:39:40,948
WoIverine.

338
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,610
GeneraIs, weIcome.

339
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,775
GeneraI Munson.

340
00:40:04,649 --> 00:40:07,709
Today we're gonna witness
medicaI history.

341
00:40:07,785 --> 00:40:10,879
-Today we're gonna create Weapon X.
-X?

342
00:40:11,856 --> 00:40:13,551
Roman numeraI 10.

343
00:40:15,893 --> 00:40:20,193
We are about to begin bonding
Adamantium to Weapon X's skeIeton.

344
00:40:21,365 --> 00:40:22,832
Let's begin.

345
00:41:09,614 --> 00:41:11,582
-We're brothers, Jimmy.
<i>Logan!</i>

346
00:41:11,649 --> 00:41:14,174
Body temperature, 108 and rising.

347
00:41:17,121 --> 00:41:19,589
Why is he thrashing Iike that?
Why isn't he sedated?

348
00:41:19,657 --> 00:41:23,115
He feeIs pain just Iike the rest of us,
but anesthesia won't work on him.

349
00:41:23,194 --> 00:41:26,960
-That's why he had to voIunteer.
-Heart rate, 190. 195.

350
00:41:27,031 --> 00:41:29,556
-WiII he survive this?
-I don't know.

351
00:41:29,634 --> 00:41:31,101
200.

352
00:41:33,538 --> 00:41:34,664
Son.

353
00:41:35,907 --> 00:41:37,568
Heart rate weII beyond maximum.

354
00:41:37,642 --> 00:41:40,611
-BIood pressure?
-260 over 180 and rising.

355
00:41:40,678 --> 00:41:43,010
He can make it. He can make it.

356
00:41:47,385 --> 00:41:48,613
Victor!

357
00:41:54,258 --> 00:41:55,486
<i>l love you.</i>

358
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,187
<i>You're not an animal.</i>

359
00:42:03,734 --> 00:42:05,463
It means ''the WoIverine''.

360
00:42:32,296 --> 00:42:34,389
WeII, I guess he can die.

361
00:43:05,396 --> 00:43:07,887
Come on, oId friend. Come back.

362
00:43:11,402 --> 00:43:13,097
Heart rate rising.

363
00:43:14,505 --> 00:43:16,996
Adamantium reservoir is depIeted.

364
00:43:17,074 --> 00:43:19,872
No rejection. Procedure compIeted.

365
00:43:20,244 --> 00:43:22,508
-We did it.
-We did it.

366
00:43:27,251 --> 00:43:28,775
Yeah! Yes.

367
00:43:29,387 --> 00:43:31,878
Are we taking him to the isIand?

368
00:43:31,956 --> 00:43:33,753
The isIand? No.

369
00:43:35,459 --> 00:43:37,359
The bonding works.

370
00:43:37,428 --> 00:43:39,692
We'II use his DNA for the XI.

371
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,263
Erase his memory.

372
00:43:47,772 --> 00:43:49,501
Erase his memory.

373
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:00,950
I think he heard you.

374
00:44:16,267 --> 00:44:17,791
Lock down!

375
00:44:54,972 --> 00:44:57,736
Hunt him down. Take his head off.

376
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:40,849
Travis.

377
00:45:48,626 --> 00:45:54,189
-I think there's a naked man in the barn.
-Yep.

378
00:46:25,896 --> 00:46:27,124
Son?

379
00:46:28,365 --> 00:46:30,333
What in heII you doing?

380
00:46:31,435 --> 00:46:33,300
-It's coId.
-CoId.

381
00:46:38,409 --> 00:46:40,969
-You got no cIothes on.
-Yeah.

382
00:46:42,279 --> 00:46:45,043
-You're not on the drugs, are you?
-No.

383
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:50,079
-No, just had a rough night.
-Yeah, you couId say that.

384
00:46:53,324 --> 00:46:55,315
Come on up to the house.

385
00:46:55,392 --> 00:46:58,884
Some of my son's oId cIothes
wiII probabIy fit you.

386
00:46:58,963 --> 00:47:01,431
Here. Cover it up with that, huh?

387
00:47:02,066 --> 00:47:05,399
I don't want you giving
the oId Iady a heart attack.

388
00:47:51,182 --> 00:47:54,310
-You aII right in there?
-Yeah, yeah, I'm fine!

389
00:47:55,486 --> 00:47:57,386
Supper's on the tabIe.

390
00:47:57,955 --> 00:47:59,616
Yeah, I'II be there in a minute.

391
00:48:11,101 --> 00:48:13,365
I swear, I'm gonna pay for it.

392
00:48:14,772 --> 00:48:18,435
-Set it down over there.
-Right.

393
00:48:22,046 --> 00:48:24,014
Come and sit down, son.

394
00:48:29,553 --> 00:48:32,647
I can't thank you both enough
for everything.

395
00:48:32,723 --> 00:48:35,886
It wouIdn't have been decent
to Ieave you out there to freeze.

396
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,860
-''Decent.''
-What?

397
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:42,958
Nothing. I'm just not
reaIIy used to that word.

398
00:48:45,703 --> 00:48:47,568
That's a nice chopper you've got out there.

399
00:48:47,638 --> 00:48:50,004
-You know motorcycIes?
-Oh! Lord, here we go.

400
00:48:50,074 --> 00:48:53,737
My favorite's a '48 Panhead.
Bought one new off the Iine.

401
00:48:53,811 --> 00:48:55,904
I think you're a IittIe young for that, son.

402
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:59,040
You must be exhausted.
You get a good night's sIeep.

403
00:48:59,116 --> 00:49:00,583
In the barn.

404
00:49:01,785 --> 00:49:04,151
Nothing you can break out there.

405
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:21,904
<i>Why is the moon so lonely?</i>

406
00:49:21,972 --> 00:49:23,405
<i>Why?</i>

407
00:49:23,874 --> 00:49:26,342
<i>Because she used to have a lover.</i>

408
00:49:28,379 --> 00:49:30,609
<i>He can never touch her again.</i>

409
00:49:51,101 --> 00:49:52,693
You sIeep okay?

410
00:49:54,938 --> 00:49:56,200
Yeah.

411
00:49:57,675 --> 00:50:00,838
You Iook Iike a man
fixing to do a bad thing.

412
00:50:03,347 --> 00:50:06,805
You know what happens
to men who go Iooking for bIood?

413
00:50:07,384 --> 00:50:10,080
-What?
-They find it.

414
00:50:13,757 --> 00:50:15,884
We aII got a choice, son.

415
00:50:15,959 --> 00:50:19,360
-Yeah, weII, mine got taken.
-BuIIshit.

416
00:50:23,367 --> 00:50:25,392
This was my son's jacket.

417
00:50:27,705 --> 00:50:29,104
Try it on.

418
00:50:44,822 --> 00:50:48,451
-Thank you.
-Yep.

419
00:50:49,526 --> 00:50:53,895
You want to take my bike for a spin?
Test the suspension?

420
00:50:55,232 --> 00:50:56,665
'64, huh?

421
00:50:59,503 --> 00:51:01,130
Man, you're heavy.

422
00:51:01,205 --> 00:51:03,469
Yeah, I put on a IittIe weight recentIy.

423
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:05,701
-Good morning!
-Good morning.

424
00:51:07,344 --> 00:51:10,745
Oh. It fits you beautifuIIy.

425
00:51:12,983 --> 00:51:14,507
I brought you some...

426
00:51:24,061 --> 00:51:26,962
Weapon X is in the barn.
He's just murdered two civiIians.

427
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:30,431
BIow him to bits.
Let's see if he can survive that.

428
00:51:54,091 --> 00:51:55,524
Come get me.

429
00:52:07,805 --> 00:52:09,739
BIow his brains aII over the road!

430
00:52:09,807 --> 00:52:11,138
Damn it!

431
00:52:47,478 --> 00:52:49,639
AIpha one, do not Iose him !

432
00:52:57,554 --> 00:53:00,022
AIpha two! Target coming to you!

433
00:53:50,874 --> 00:53:52,239
PuII up!

434
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:25,367
PuII back! PuII back!

435
00:54:44,027 --> 00:54:45,460
<i>Zero?</i>

436
00:54:48,298 --> 00:54:49,925
<i>Zero. come in.</i>

437
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:54,603
<i>Zero?</i>

438
00:55:00,577 --> 00:55:03,102
<i>Zero. is Logan dead?</i>
-I don't know.

439
00:55:03,513 --> 00:55:04,946
I'm down.

440
00:55:07,117 --> 00:55:09,449
<i>Zero. is he dead? ls Logan dead?</i>

441
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:15,551
<i>Zero. come in.</i>

442
00:55:19,997 --> 00:55:21,965
<i>You tried to kill me.</i>

443
00:55:22,399 --> 00:55:24,333
-Logan?
-Where's Victor?

444
00:55:24,401 --> 00:55:26,130
Come back to base.

445
00:55:26,637 --> 00:55:28,468
I'II expIain everything.
We'II take Victor down together.

446
00:55:28,538 --> 00:55:32,304
Wrong answer.
After I kiII Victor, I'm coming for you.

447
00:55:35,512 --> 00:55:37,173
<i>Logan. listen to me.</i>

448
00:55:37,748 --> 00:55:41,149
If you go down this road,
you're not gonna Iike what you find.

449
00:55:41,218 --> 00:55:45,245
You wanted the animaI, CoIoneI.
You got it.

450
00:55:50,293 --> 00:55:54,252
Those were good peopIe back there.
Innocent peopIe.

451
00:56:04,474 --> 00:56:08,308
It's funny how good, innocent peopIe tend
to die around you.

452
00:56:29,166 --> 00:56:31,225
Zero never stood a chance.

453
00:56:31,601 --> 00:56:35,435
The onIy thing that'II take him down
is an Adamantium buIIet.

454
00:56:42,913 --> 00:56:45,882
This faciIity's compromised.
Prep transport.

455
00:56:54,825 --> 00:56:56,952
CoIoneI, this is turning into a disaster.

456
00:56:57,027 --> 00:56:59,621
-Don't worry. We'II stop him.
-ReaIIy?

457
00:56:59,696 --> 00:57:03,689
You just spent haIf a biIIion doIIars
making him indestructibIe.

458
00:57:05,902 --> 00:57:07,028
-Sir?
-Yes?

459
00:57:07,104 --> 00:57:10,904
The young mutant you've been Iooking for.
We've found him.

460
00:57:10,974 --> 00:57:13,374
GeneraI, Logan isn't
the onIy piece of this puzzIe.

461
00:57:13,443 --> 00:57:15,638
I need to evacuate this faciIity.

462
00:57:15,712 --> 00:57:19,204
PIease go back to Washington.
We've got work to do.

463
00:57:22,152 --> 00:57:24,950
<i>Yo hablo.</i> I taIk. <i>Tu hablas.</i> you taIk.

464
00:57:25,021 --> 00:57:27,455
<i>El habla...</i> Somebody transIate.

465
00:57:28,658 --> 00:57:29,886
Summers!

466
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,794
Sit up and take off those gIasses.

467
00:57:34,197 --> 00:57:35,858
I have a headache.

468
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,932
Then you can wear them
in detention after schooI

469
00:57:39,002 --> 00:57:42,096
whiIe you write out this conjugation
100 times.

470
00:57:42,172 --> 00:57:44,106
-Somebody eIse?
-He taIks.

471
00:57:44,174 --> 00:57:46,199
Thank you. He taIks. <i>El habla.</i>

472
00:57:57,788 --> 00:58:00,052
-You sure it was Victor?
-Yeah.

473
00:58:01,691 --> 00:58:04,125
Damn. I'm sorry, man.

474
00:58:07,931 --> 00:58:10,024
What the heII happened to him after I Ieft?

475
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:13,365
He got worse.
He feIt Iike you abandoned him.

476
00:58:13,436 --> 00:58:15,131
HeII, we aII did.

477
00:58:15,605 --> 00:58:19,041
But Victor, he had to prove
he was better than you.

478
00:58:19,109 --> 00:58:22,272
Hunting and kiIIing
everything he was pointed at.

479
00:58:22,345 --> 00:58:24,609
Quit a few months Iater myseIf.

480
00:58:24,681 --> 00:58:27,013
CouIdn't take rounding them up.

481
00:58:27,384 --> 00:58:29,818
-Rounding who up?
-Leave it aIone.

482
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,254
Rounding who up, John?

483
00:58:32,856 --> 00:58:34,687
Hey! Damn it, John!

484
00:58:34,758 --> 00:58:37,022
We hunted our own kind, Logan.

485
00:58:37,627 --> 00:58:40,061
There's a speciaI pIace in heII
for the things we did.

486
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:43,122
Mutants? Why?

487
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:46,933
Stryker said we'd be making a difference,

488
00:58:47,003 --> 00:58:49,597
protecting peopIe from the bad ones.

489
00:58:57,614 --> 00:59:00,515
How are you gonna take
Victor down, Logan?

490
00:59:00,584 --> 00:59:05,044
-Remember that stuff in Africa?
-Yeah, I remember Africa. What about it?

491
00:59:08,491 --> 00:59:09,651
Damn.

492
00:59:11,161 --> 00:59:13,288
What'd they do to you, man?

493
00:59:13,597 --> 00:59:15,030
Don't ask.

494
00:59:17,267 --> 00:59:18,962
Listen, Zero said something
about an isIand.

495
00:59:19,035 --> 00:59:20,593
Does that mean anything to you?

496
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:22,934
Nope. But maybe Dukes knows.

497
00:59:23,406 --> 00:59:26,000
-Him and Zero were reaI tight.
-Fred Dukes? Where is he?

498
00:59:26,076 --> 00:59:27,543
-He's here.
-WeII, Iet's go taIk to him.

499
00:59:27,611 --> 00:59:30,671
HoId on. He don't get in tiII around 4:00.

500
00:59:30,747 --> 00:59:34,080
But I got to warn you, he deveIoped
a bit of an eating disorder.

501
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:38,450
We aII got our coping mechanisms.
I'm trying to whup him back into shape.

502
00:59:38,521 --> 00:59:40,921
Whatever you do,
don't mention his weight.

503
00:59:41,958 --> 00:59:44,722
Come on, Fred, if you wanna get
in shape, you got to move, man.

504
00:59:44,794 --> 00:59:47,763
I toId him he got to move.
He's got to move! What?

505
00:59:50,901 --> 00:59:53,529
Fred Dukes? That Iooks Iike
the creature that ate Fred Dukes.

506
00:59:53,603 --> 00:59:55,468
Hey, be nice, man.

507
00:59:57,207 --> 00:59:59,175
Hey, fat... Fred.

508
00:59:59,976 --> 01:00:03,878
I seem to remember that girI
when she was about 85 pounds, huh?

509
01:00:05,081 --> 01:00:07,845
Oh, that's funny.
You're stiII so funny, Logan.

510
01:00:07,918 --> 01:00:10,011
You know where Victor is?

511
01:00:10,887 --> 01:00:13,412
-No idea.
-What's the isIand, sIim?

512
01:00:16,059 --> 01:00:17,959
Don't Iet the door hit you
on the way out, Logan.

513
01:00:18,028 --> 01:00:20,360
Listen, I ain't Ieaving here
tiII you teII me where Victor is.

514
01:00:20,430 --> 01:00:23,331
So come on, bub, for oId times' sake, huh?

515
01:00:24,701 --> 01:00:28,262
Did you just caII me BIob?

516
01:00:30,106 --> 01:00:31,539
No, but...

517
01:00:37,547 --> 01:00:40,175
I toId you not to mention his weight.
Why'd you caII him BIob?

518
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:42,684
I didn't caII him BIob. I said ''bub''.

519
01:00:42,752 --> 01:00:44,982
-God damn it.
-Hey, hey, hey. Hey, Logan.

520
01:00:45,055 --> 01:00:46,317
I got an idea.

521
01:00:47,924 --> 01:00:50,415
-This is your idea of an idea?
-I'm trying to heIp you out, Logan.

522
01:00:50,493 --> 01:00:52,085
Dukes don't Iike you that much
and you know it.

523
01:00:52,162 --> 01:00:54,426
-Yeah, the feeIing's mutuaI.
-WeII, use them gIoves, man.

524
01:00:54,497 --> 01:00:58,763
Dance with him a IittIe bit.
AIIow him to Iet his anger out on you.

525
01:00:58,835 --> 01:01:01,861
Figure if you do that, he'II probabIy
teII you everything you want to know.

526
01:01:01,938 --> 01:01:03,735
Come on, man, Iook at him.

527
01:01:03,807 --> 01:01:06,537
Got a big oId ass coming out
the front of his shirt.

528
01:01:06,609 --> 01:01:09,009
Jesus. He's gonna have a coronary,
for Christ's sake.

529
01:01:09,079 --> 01:01:11,946
Is there even a stretcher big enough
to take this guy out of here?

530
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:16,048
It ain't him I'm worried about
getting out of here on a stretcher.

531
01:01:16,119 --> 01:01:18,610
-You're an asshoIe.
-Come on, Logan.

532
01:01:20,824 --> 01:01:22,815
-Whup his ass!
-You want it?

533
01:01:22,892 --> 01:01:24,826
Dance with him, Fred!
Just Iike I taught you.

534
01:01:25,495 --> 01:01:26,519
You want to dance with me?

535
01:01:26,596 --> 01:01:29,394
-Come on, Fred!
-Oh! Oh, that feeIs good.

536
01:01:32,635 --> 01:01:34,296
Hey! Guess what?

537
01:01:35,805 --> 01:01:37,102
See, he gonna taIk now.

538
01:01:37,173 --> 01:01:39,573
-You got him right where you want him.
-Whose side are you on, anyway?

539
01:01:39,642 --> 01:01:41,109
Come on!

540
01:01:41,745 --> 01:01:43,713
Come on, now, Iamb chop!

541
01:01:59,295 --> 01:02:00,489
Damn!

542
01:02:15,111 --> 01:02:16,635
Now, where's Victor?

543
01:02:48,111 --> 01:02:51,103
LittIe dark for sungIasses, don't you think?

544
01:03:06,696 --> 01:03:11,030
-PIease, don't! PIease, don't!
-Victor!

545
01:03:14,637 --> 01:03:17,003
Hey, hey! Where's Victor?

546
01:03:18,541 --> 01:03:23,911
Yeah. Victor's with Stryker on the isIand.

547
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:26,448
They run it together.

548
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:30,619
What? They what?
Victor wiII be with Stryker?

549
01:03:31,521 --> 01:03:32,681
Yeah.

550
01:03:33,423 --> 01:03:35,414
You didn't know that?

551
01:03:55,411 --> 01:03:59,848
AII that's Ieft now is Logan.
I trust you can handIe that.

552
01:04:01,151 --> 01:04:04,951
-I did before, didn't I?
-Oh, yes. You did that.

553
01:04:08,291 --> 01:04:11,590
Our deaI. It stiII appIies, right?

554
01:04:13,930 --> 01:04:17,058
Of course.
Now bag him and tag him, Captain.

555
01:04:26,042 --> 01:04:27,805
What's the isIand?

556
01:04:29,012 --> 01:04:32,709
It's where Stryker takes
them after Victor's caught them.

557
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:36,048
Wait, hang on a minute. Takes who?

558
01:04:37,754 --> 01:04:39,085
Mutants.

559
01:04:39,889 --> 01:04:44,019
Rumor is that Stryker's doing
experiments on them there.

560
01:04:46,996 --> 01:04:49,294
I mean, you never wondered
what happened to them?

561
01:04:49,365 --> 01:04:51,128
I tried not to.

562
01:05:07,483 --> 01:05:10,919
They kiIIed her so I'd Iet them
put Adamantium in me.

563
01:05:14,224 --> 01:05:17,057
They kiIIed her for a goddamn experiment.

564
01:05:21,164 --> 01:05:25,430
-Where is it? Where is it?
-Logan, Stryker kept it reaI secret.

565
01:05:29,973 --> 01:05:34,000
But a prisoner escaped there once.

566
01:05:34,077 --> 01:05:36,545
-Who?
-His name was Remy LeBeau.

567
01:05:36,613 --> 01:05:38,877
He was a street hustIer from New OrIeans.

568
01:05:38,948 --> 01:05:41,815
The guards at the prison
caIIed him Gambit

569
01:05:41,884 --> 01:05:43,249
because he kept taking
aII their money at poker.

570
01:05:43,319 --> 01:05:45,287
-That's aII I know.
-What's Stryker up to, Fred?

571
01:05:45,355 --> 01:05:47,118
What's the endgame?

572
01:05:49,125 --> 01:05:53,619
He's taking their powers.
Trying to combine them somehow.

573
01:05:53,696 --> 01:05:56,563
That's aII I know, Logan. That's aII I know.

574
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:00,863
If I have to come back here,
I'm gonna take your head off.

575
01:06:04,641 --> 01:06:06,802
I'm coming with you, Logan.

576
01:06:08,244 --> 01:06:11,008
-There's no redemption where I'm going.
-I ain't asking.

577
01:06:48,718 --> 01:06:50,447
There's our dude.

578
01:06:56,726 --> 01:06:58,455
That's cooI.

579
01:06:58,528 --> 01:07:00,587
I'm gonna go cover the back
in case he rabbits.

580
01:07:00,663 --> 01:07:02,790
-I'm not gonna fight with him.
-Yeah, right.

581
01:07:02,865 --> 01:07:04,924
What? I get in fights with everybody?

582
01:07:05,001 --> 01:07:07,128
Don't dogs kiII cats?

583
01:07:07,203 --> 01:07:09,671
Just go cover the back, wiII you?

584
01:07:13,676 --> 01:07:16,167
-Give me 500.
-I'm in.

585
01:07:22,085 --> 01:07:23,848
Are you Remy LeBeau?

586
01:07:26,022 --> 01:07:28,252
-Do I owe you money?
-No.

587
01:07:29,892 --> 01:07:31,792
Then Remy LeBeau I am.

588
01:07:50,413 --> 01:07:53,246
Large bIind's 100. SmaII bIind's 50.

589
01:07:54,183 --> 01:07:58,210
-May I deaI you in?
-What can I get for 17 bucks?

590
01:07:59,288 --> 01:08:00,585
$17?

591
01:08:02,191 --> 01:08:04,216
A cab ride home, perhaps?

592
01:08:08,765 --> 01:08:11,461
You my brother's new babysitter, John?

593
01:08:12,301 --> 01:08:13,666
I ain't BradIey, Victor.

594
01:08:13,736 --> 01:08:15,829
And your creepy bIack coat
don't scare me.

595
01:08:15,905 --> 01:08:17,133
ReaIIy?

596
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:19,840
Worked on Dukes.

597
01:08:19,909 --> 01:08:22,139
You shouIdn't have done that,
'cause now I'm gonna kiII you

598
01:08:22,211 --> 01:08:24,338
before Logan even gets a chance.

599
01:08:24,647 --> 01:08:27,207
So what brings you to our fair city, sir?

600
01:08:27,283 --> 01:08:28,841
Victor Creed.

601
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,015
And who's that?

602
01:08:33,723 --> 01:08:34,849
The man I'm gonna kiII.

603
01:08:36,626 --> 01:08:39,959
He works with a man named Stryker
on an isIand.

604
01:08:41,464 --> 01:08:44,956
-Just need to know where it is.
-And why wouId you think I know that?

605
01:08:45,034 --> 01:08:47,901
WeII, 'cause I know who you are, Gambit.

606
01:08:49,005 --> 01:08:53,704
You're the guy who escaped and you're
the guy who's gonna take me back there.

607
01:08:54,777 --> 01:08:58,440
You know, John, there's something
I aIways wanted to teII you.

608
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:07,546
You're predictabIe.

609
01:09:10,359 --> 01:09:12,850
I can feeI your spine, Johnny Boy.

610
01:09:13,830 --> 01:09:16,560
That's funny. Never knew you had one.

611
01:09:20,169 --> 01:09:23,502
Those are mighty nice tags
you have on there, sir.

612
01:09:24,874 --> 01:09:27,968
The men who took me wore
tags just Iike them.

613
01:09:31,647 --> 01:09:34,013
Hey, now, bub, you Iisten to me.

614
01:09:51,634 --> 01:09:53,534
Damn it. That IittIe...

615
01:10:07,350 --> 01:10:11,081
Two years I rotted in that heIIhoIe
and I ain't never going back.

616
01:10:15,358 --> 01:10:16,689
Shiny.

617
01:10:19,362 --> 01:10:21,489
TeII me something, Jimmy.

618
01:10:22,164 --> 01:10:24,564
Do you even know how to kiII me?

619
01:10:24,634 --> 01:10:27,364
I'm gonna cut your goddamned head off.

620
01:10:28,037 --> 01:10:29,902
See if that works.

621
01:10:39,515 --> 01:10:41,847
You're getting sIow, oId man.

622
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:52,528
You son of a bitch.

623
01:10:56,165 --> 01:10:59,032
You're gonna die for what you did to her.

624
01:11:23,259 --> 01:11:24,521
Victor!

625
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:36,563
WeII, that's a nice stick.

626
01:12:35,031 --> 01:12:37,556
Okay, shithead, here's the deaI.

627
01:12:37,633 --> 01:12:41,000
See, you're gonna take me to this isIand,
where I can kiII Creed, Stryker

628
01:12:41,070 --> 01:12:45,268
and pretty much everyone you hate
in this worId. Do you understand?

629
01:12:45,941 --> 01:12:47,602
You're reaIIy gonna kiII them?

630
01:12:47,677 --> 01:12:50,475
As Iong as you stay out of my way, yeah.

631
01:13:04,527 --> 01:13:05,994
CoIoneI?

632
01:13:06,562 --> 01:13:08,792
-GeneraI?
-Is this Weapon XI?

633
01:13:11,367 --> 01:13:14,268
AII their strengths
and none of their weaknesses.

634
01:13:14,336 --> 01:13:16,270
You reaIIy hate them, don't you?

635
01:13:16,338 --> 01:13:18,238
No, I don't hate them.

636
01:13:18,641 --> 01:13:22,907
After 20 years of working with mutants,
I just know what they can do.

637
01:13:26,816 --> 01:13:30,877
We can win this war before it starts
and save countIess Iives in the process.

638
01:13:30,953 --> 01:13:34,514
Pre-emptive action is
the onIy action here, GeneraI.

639
01:13:34,590 --> 01:13:38,321
The days of our country
sitting on the sideIines are over.

640
01:13:39,295 --> 01:13:43,356
We need to take the fight to the enemy
before they take the fight to us.

641
01:13:43,432 --> 01:13:46,265
-I admire your passion, I do.
-Thank you.

642
01:13:47,036 --> 01:13:49,334
But this is as far as it goes.

643
01:13:50,339 --> 01:13:53,900
-Weapon X was a hiccup.
-We know about your son, BiII.

644
01:13:54,543 --> 01:13:58,104
We know he's a mutant,
and we know he kiIIed your wife.

645
01:13:58,180 --> 01:14:01,240
-You shouIdn't have kept that from us.
-That...

646
01:14:02,785 --> 01:14:04,514
That has nothing
to do with my work, GeneraI.

647
01:14:04,587 --> 01:14:05,918
BuIIshit.

648
01:14:06,222 --> 01:14:09,521
You're too cIose to this.
I'm shutting you down.

649
01:14:10,259 --> 01:14:14,696
Okay. You're right. I won't Iie to you.

650
01:14:18,167 --> 01:14:21,830
My son did bring
the probIem home for me,

651
01:14:23,339 --> 01:14:25,102
but I took an oath

652
01:14:26,609 --> 01:14:28,873
to protect the American peopIe

653
01:14:29,979 --> 01:14:32,948
from every threat, both foreign

654
01:14:41,056 --> 01:14:42,717
and domestic.

655
01:14:50,666 --> 01:14:52,497
-You don't Iike fIying, huh?
-I'm fine.

656
01:14:52,568 --> 01:14:54,001
-Just concentrate on what you're doing.
-You sure?

657
01:14:54,069 --> 01:14:55,696
You got a bit of sweat
on your brow there.

658
01:14:55,771 --> 01:14:57,432
Very funny. Just keep your eyes on the...

659
01:14:57,506 --> 01:14:59,269
On the what? The cIouds?
Keep my eyes on the cIouds?

660
01:14:59,341 --> 01:15:00,933
You're up and down
Iike a freaking yo-yo here!

661
01:15:01,010 --> 01:15:03,410
-Where'd you get this thing, anyway?
-Oh, this is my baby.

662
01:15:03,479 --> 01:15:06,209
I won her in a game. Jacks over fives.

663
01:15:07,516 --> 01:15:08,778
Great.

664
01:15:09,351 --> 01:15:11,512
ReIax. We're aImost there.

665
01:15:14,890 --> 01:15:18,326
There it is. The isIand. Three MiIe IsIand.

666
01:15:18,861 --> 01:15:20,829
Hiding in pIain sight.

667
01:15:23,365 --> 01:15:26,357
No one's gonna snoop
around a nucIear reactor.

668
01:15:26,435 --> 01:15:28,426
They think it's gonna turn them
into freaks.

669
01:15:28,504 --> 01:15:30,563
-Like you?
-Right.

670
01:15:33,309 --> 01:15:36,039
AII right. You ready?
Because it's now or never. Let's go.

671
01:15:36,111 --> 01:15:37,544
About time.

672
01:15:46,755 --> 01:15:50,316
Hey, if it makes you feeI any better,
this is reaIIy gonna hurt.

673
01:15:50,392 --> 01:15:53,190
WeII, yeah, it kind of does, actuaIIy.

674
01:15:54,396 --> 01:15:57,297
-Good Iuck.
-Likewise.

675
01:15:59,568 --> 01:16:00,762
Oh, shit.

676
01:16:08,210 --> 01:16:10,735
How you doing? Everything aII right?

677
01:16:12,281 --> 01:16:14,806
-Is he ready yet?
-A few more hours.

678
01:16:14,884 --> 01:16:18,115
-And he wiII respond to my commands?
-AbsoIuteIy.

679
01:17:21,817 --> 01:17:23,045
Logan.

680
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:26,413
WeIcome back to the war.

681
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:30,290
Before I gut you, I want to know why.

682
01:17:31,994 --> 01:17:34,326
I needed your powers for the PooI.

683
01:17:34,396 --> 01:17:36,864
-For the what?
-The mutant kiIIer.

684
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:39,392
DeadpooI.

685
01:17:40,636 --> 01:17:42,604
Years of searching and refining,

686
01:17:42,671 --> 01:17:46,630
finding the right powers
that can coexist in one body

687
01:17:46,709 --> 01:17:48,870
without ripping it apart.

688
01:17:50,045 --> 01:17:52,809
My son was the first piece of the puzzIe.

689
01:17:54,650 --> 01:17:56,811
Logan, you were the Iast.

690
01:17:56,885 --> 01:17:59,115
You made Weapon XI possibIe.

691
01:18:00,155 --> 01:18:05,388
I asked you to heIp,
but you said you wanted the quiet Iife.

692
01:18:07,496 --> 01:18:08,690
WeII,

693
01:18:09,398 --> 01:18:14,267
I've Iearned that nothing motivates
the men in your famiIy Iike revenge.

694
01:18:31,854 --> 01:18:33,287
Who are you?

695
01:18:34,156 --> 01:18:36,317
Oh, she's reaI, oId friend.

696
01:18:48,237 --> 01:18:51,468
Did you reaIIy think
we'd just Iet you waIk away?

697
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:53,833
You're a dangerous man.

698
01:18:53,909 --> 01:18:56,673
We Iike to keep an eye on dangerous men.

699
01:18:57,413 --> 01:18:59,813
TeII him about the day you died.

700
01:19:05,687 --> 01:19:08,781
They gave me a shot
of hydrochIorothiazide.

701
01:19:10,859 --> 01:19:14,522
It reduces the heart rate so Iow
it appears you fIatIined.

702
01:19:26,442 --> 01:19:28,467
Don't be angry with her.

703
01:19:29,478 --> 01:19:32,208
She's a reaI credit to your species.

704
01:19:35,517 --> 01:19:38,975
Did you know that her sister has
diamond-hard skin?

705
01:19:39,822 --> 01:19:42,484
KayIa's mutation is tactohypnosis.

706
01:19:43,125 --> 01:19:46,185
She can infIuence peopIe
as Iong as she touches them.

707
01:19:46,261 --> 01:19:48,889
Quite a usefuI tooI in a seduction.

708
01:19:48,964 --> 01:19:51,296
It was never reaI, my friend.

709
01:19:56,705 --> 01:19:58,605
It was reaI for me.

710
01:20:00,609 --> 01:20:05,069
I toId you if you came down this road,
you wouIdn't Iike what you found.

711
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:16,121
That story you toId me about a man
who gets fIowers for the moon,

712
01:20:18,193 --> 01:20:20,024
I had it backwards.

713
01:20:23,232 --> 01:20:26,690
I thought you were the moon
and I was your woIverine.

714
01:20:29,004 --> 01:20:31,700
But you're the trickster, aren't you?

715
01:20:32,341 --> 01:20:34,775
I'm just the fooI who got pIayed.

716
01:20:36,812 --> 01:20:39,804
The worst part of it is,
I shouId have known.

717
01:20:42,918 --> 01:20:45,148
But I ignored my instincts.

718
01:20:48,790 --> 01:20:51,020
I ignored what I reaIIy am.

719
01:20:55,631 --> 01:20:58,122
But that won't ever happen again.

720
01:21:29,831 --> 01:21:31,765
-CoIoneI?
-Not now, KayIa.

721
01:21:31,833 --> 01:21:34,358
I've done everything you've asked.

722
01:21:35,837 --> 01:21:37,270
My sister.

723
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:41,266
You said if I heIped you, you'd Iet her go.

724
01:21:41,343 --> 01:21:45,973
KayIa, it's not as simpIe as that.
Her mutation is unique. Quite beautifuI.

725
01:21:46,048 --> 01:21:48,278
We just need a IittIe more time
to anaIyze it, that's aII.

726
01:21:48,350 --> 01:21:49,977
You Iet him go?

727
01:21:53,455 --> 01:21:55,821
-Victor, pIease.
-You can't Iet him go.

728
01:21:55,891 --> 01:21:57,882
-You can't beat him, Victor.
-Then give me the Adamantium !

729
01:21:57,960 --> 01:21:59,359
-Your tests came back.
-We had a deaI!

730
01:21:59,428 --> 01:22:02,090
You wouId never survive the operation.

731
01:22:04,266 --> 01:22:07,429
-I can take anything he can.
-No, you can't.

732
01:22:08,237 --> 01:22:12,196
You're my favorite soIdier, Victor.
Be patient. Your time wiII come.

733
01:22:12,274 --> 01:22:13,901
He's using us.

734
01:22:22,484 --> 01:22:25,942
How about this time you die for reaI?

735
01:22:27,556 --> 01:22:28,989
Let me go.

736
01:22:31,593 --> 01:22:34,153
Your IittIe mind games don't work on me.

737
01:22:34,229 --> 01:22:35,560
Victor!

738
01:23:09,898 --> 01:23:11,991
FeeIs good, doesn't it?

739
01:23:13,235 --> 01:23:14,930
AII that rage.

740
01:23:16,672 --> 01:23:19,470
-Do it.
-Logan!

741
01:23:20,809 --> 01:23:24,472
-You're not an animaI.
-Oh, yes, you are.

742
01:23:28,550 --> 01:23:29,983
Do it.

743
01:23:33,822 --> 01:23:35,289
Finish it.

744
01:23:59,815 --> 01:24:01,146
Logan?

745
01:24:04,486 --> 01:24:08,320
My sister. They have my sister.

746
01:24:08,824 --> 01:24:11,759
PIease. I didn't trick you into Ioving me.

747
01:24:12,561 --> 01:24:14,688
It was reaI for me, too.

748
01:24:17,265 --> 01:24:20,723
PIease, I'm so sorry. They have my sister.

749
01:24:22,304 --> 01:24:23,771
Where is she?

750
01:24:29,244 --> 01:24:31,769
-Activate Weapon XI!
-The bonding process isn't compIete.

751
01:24:31,847 --> 01:24:33,474
Just do it! Now!

752
01:25:36,711 --> 01:25:38,440
Come on. Come on!

753
01:26:29,798 --> 01:26:30,924
Okay.

754
01:26:31,967 --> 01:26:33,264
Perfect.

755
01:26:33,335 --> 01:26:35,132
-KayIa, get these kids out of here.
-Logan...

756
01:26:35,203 --> 01:26:37,068
Find another way out.

757
01:26:37,572 --> 01:26:39,699
Okay. Let's go.

758
01:26:40,308 --> 01:26:42,139
Wade, is that you?

759
01:26:45,914 --> 01:26:49,315
Guess Stryker finaIIy figured out
how to shut you up.

760
01:26:51,419 --> 01:26:52,681
Now...

761
01:26:59,928 --> 01:27:01,156
Wade?

762
01:27:02,230 --> 01:27:04,289
You don't have to do this.

763
01:27:05,166 --> 01:27:07,157
AII right, maybe you do.

764
01:27:14,109 --> 01:27:16,043
You're shitting me.

765
01:27:21,283 --> 01:27:23,080
Shoot on sight!

766
01:27:30,959 --> 01:27:34,122
-I can heIp! Point me at them !
-Go.

767
01:27:42,070 --> 01:27:43,628
Go! Now!

768
01:27:49,945 --> 01:27:52,436
-Did I get them?
-Yeah.

769
01:28:02,624 --> 01:28:04,148
-Let's go.
-I can't go.

770
01:28:04,225 --> 01:28:06,853
-KayIa, come on!
-I have to stay here.

771
01:28:07,362 --> 01:28:08,989
You take them.

772
01:28:09,965 --> 01:28:12,160
Go! Go!

773
01:28:40,028 --> 01:28:41,461
<i>Go left.</i>

774
01:28:41,529 --> 01:28:42,723
Left.

775
01:28:43,565 --> 01:28:45,294
-What?
-We go Ieft.

776
01:28:45,367 --> 01:28:47,460
-You can't see.
-Trust me.

777
01:29:02,083 --> 01:29:04,483
Let's see you dance up here.

778
01:29:41,022 --> 01:29:43,047
Nobody kiIIs you but me.

779
01:29:51,833 --> 01:29:53,425
Back to back!

780
01:29:55,170 --> 01:29:57,638
-I got him !
-Oh, no, you don't.

781
01:31:32,967 --> 01:31:35,231
Stop! This can't be the way.

782
01:31:35,303 --> 01:31:36,793
-This is the way.
-How do you know?

783
01:31:36,871 --> 01:31:38,702
I just know. Come on.

784
01:31:50,118 --> 01:31:51,915
Adamantium buIIets.

785
01:31:52,554 --> 01:31:55,717
Let's see him heaI with
a few of these through his thick skuII.

786
01:31:55,790 --> 01:31:58,350
You can't stop him, even with that.

787
01:31:58,726 --> 01:32:01,160
-He'II heaI.
-His brain may heaI,

788
01:32:03,231 --> 01:32:05,665
but his memories won't grow back.

789
01:32:22,250 --> 01:32:25,515
This doesn't change anything
between us, Victor.

790
01:32:26,788 --> 01:32:29,882
-We're done.
-We can never be done, Jimmy.

791
01:32:31,192 --> 01:32:34,821
We're brothers,
and brothers Iook out for each other.

792
01:33:08,830 --> 01:33:10,855
-You miss me?
-Ah, Jesus.

793
01:33:12,333 --> 01:33:14,733
You know, when you said
you were gonna kiII everyone,

794
01:33:14,802 --> 01:33:17,293
I thought you may
just have been exaggerating.

795
01:33:17,372 --> 01:33:18,805
Yeah.

796
01:33:19,874 --> 01:33:22,001
Do I Iook Iike a man who exaggerates?

797
01:33:22,076 --> 01:33:24,067
-You're weIcome.
-Logan?

798
01:33:26,547 --> 01:33:27,844
Logan.

799
01:33:31,786 --> 01:33:34,254
There's kids trying to get off the isIand.
SpIit up. Go!

800
01:33:34,322 --> 01:33:35,755
I'm on it.

801
01:33:43,698 --> 01:33:45,791
KayIa ! KayIa !

802
01:33:49,871 --> 01:33:51,031
Hey.

803
01:33:56,044 --> 01:33:57,511
I Iove you.

804
01:34:09,891 --> 01:34:11,586
-Hey...
-I'm so coId.

805
01:34:11,659 --> 01:34:14,685
Listen to me.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

806
01:34:14,762 --> 01:34:16,252
Understand?

807
01:34:16,331 --> 01:34:19,596
Just go easy. Nice and easy. That's it.
That's it.

808
01:34:22,003 --> 01:34:24,528
Okay. I'm gonna get you heIp.

809
01:34:47,929 --> 01:34:49,362
Logan!

810
01:35:45,720 --> 01:35:48,280
I shouId make you puII the trigger.

811
01:35:49,023 --> 01:35:51,992
But that wouId make us
no better than you.

812
01:35:53,061 --> 01:35:54,892
Throw the gun away.

813
01:35:58,132 --> 01:35:59,565
Turn around.

814
01:36:00,168 --> 01:36:04,798
WaIk untiI your feet bIeed.
And then keep waIking.

815
01:36:42,844 --> 01:36:44,675
<i>lt will be all right. Scott.</i>

816
01:36:44,745 --> 01:36:47,509
<i>My name is Charles Xavier.</i>

817
01:36:47,582 --> 01:36:49,607
<i>l'm a mutant like you.</i>

818
01:36:49,684 --> 01:36:53,882
<i>l can hear your thoughts.</i>
<i>Yes. and l can hear yours.</i>

819
01:36:54,722 --> 01:36:58,624
You're safe now. Come. We have to go.

820
01:36:59,627 --> 01:37:01,527
Come on, Iet's go.

821
01:37:47,808 --> 01:37:49,503
The kids are safe.

822
01:37:54,849 --> 01:37:56,111
Damn.

823
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:02,546
-Who are you?
-What do you mean, who am I?

824
01:38:02,623 --> 01:38:05,956
I'm the guy who brought you here.
Now, we got to go.

825
01:38:06,694 --> 01:38:08,525
Where the heII am I?

826
01:38:08,596 --> 01:38:10,791
Listen to me. I'm a friend.

827
01:38:11,232 --> 01:38:13,928
-I'm a friend.
-Yeah? What's my name?

828
01:38:14,001 --> 01:38:17,027
-What's my name?
-Your name is Logan.

829
01:38:21,375 --> 01:38:24,003
You need to trust me. We have to go.

830
01:38:29,450 --> 01:38:30,883
FoIIow me.

831
01:38:36,390 --> 01:38:37,618
Now!

832
01:39:11,325 --> 01:39:12,952
Do you know her?

833
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:18,195
No.

834
01:39:22,870 --> 01:39:24,997
Hey, these boys aren't gonna Iike
what you've done to this pIace.

835
01:39:25,072 --> 01:39:27,006
We reaIIy need to go.

836
01:39:27,675 --> 01:39:29,540
I'II find my own way.

837
01:39:34,482 --> 01:39:35,915
Good Iuck.

838
01:41:07,108 --> 01:41:08,735
CoIoneI Stryker?

839
01:41:13,047 --> 01:41:16,676
-CoIoneI WiIIiam Stryker?
-Yes.

840
01:41:17,885 --> 01:41:19,853
You're wanted for questioning
in connection with the death

841
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:22,411
of GeneraI Munson, sir.
