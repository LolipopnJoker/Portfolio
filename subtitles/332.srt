1
00:00:02,911 --> 00:00:03,953
Steady.

2
00:00:03,995 --> 00:00:05,205
Pico Boulevard.

3
00:00:05,288 --> 00:00:07,624
At Rene's Building Shop
in the building next to the location.

4
00:00:07,665 --> 00:00:09,751
Suspects are seen climbing out...

5
00:00:16,507 --> 00:00:18,760
Violent street gangs from Los Angeles

6
00:00:18,801 --> 00:00:21,971
are now trafficking in drugs
in cities far from their own turf.

7
00:00:22,138 --> 00:00:23,306
...Crips, the bloods.

8
00:00:23,389 --> 00:00:25,029
...Has enabled the gangs
to become richer,

9
00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:26,476
better armed and better organized.

10
00:00:26,517 --> 00:00:27,685
Drugs are menacing our society.

11
00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:30,355
...the war on drugs is focused
on crack, the super-addictive...

12
00:00:30,438 --> 00:00:32,315
...the Los Angeles police
department's crash program.

13
00:00:32,357 --> 00:00:33,775
They will have
no dark alleyways to hide in.

14
00:00:33,816 --> 00:00:35,526
I, Lieutenant Colonel North,

15
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,654
I don't recall that conversation.

16
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:40,949
You are now about to witness
the strength of street knowledge

17
00:01:39,924 --> 00:01:41,968
I'm about to give
you this right here.

18
00:01:42,051 --> 00:01:43,052
Yeah?

19
00:01:48,558 --> 00:01:49,851
Who is it?

20
00:01:50,268 --> 00:01:52,478
You know who it is.

21
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,149
Open the fucking door.

22
00:01:58,610 --> 00:01:59,736
Open the door.

23
00:02:00,528 --> 00:02:03,031
Hurry up, man. Open the fucking door.

24
00:02:05,408 --> 00:02:06,534

25
00:02:06,576 --> 00:02:08,203

26
00:02:08,494 --> 00:02:09,662
A'ight.

27
00:02:09,746 --> 00:02:10,747

00:02:27,764 --> 00:02:28,806
What y'all tryin' to do?

32
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,851
Oh, you ain't heard?

00:02:34,604 --> 00:02:35,939
That's sad.

35
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:38,358

36
00:02:38,816 --> 00:02:39,859

44
00:02:51,287 --> 00:02:53,623
Bitch, I just said I wasn't thirsty!

45
00:02:53,665 --> 00:02:56,125
Hold up.
Why you gotta be so ruthless, Eric?

46
00:02:57,001 --> 00:02:58,253

47
00:02:58,294 --> 00:03:00,213
What, y'all don't want something to drink?

48
00:03:01,506 --> 00:03:03,925
You want some pussy?

49
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:06,493

00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:09,639

00:06:17,118 --> 00:06:19,621
My life, my life, my life

78
00:06:19,662 --> 00:06:21,497
In the sunshine

79
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:26,836
Everybody loves the sunshine

80
00:06:31,883 --> 00:06:33,343
Sunshine

81
00:06:36,638 --> 00:06:38,681
Everybody loves the sunshine

82
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,521

00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:52,737
Do you even care how it makes me look?

86
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,240
Called in favors to get
your thoughtless ass

87
00:06:55,323 --> 00:06:58,576
an interview and you can't even show up?

88
00:07:00,161 --> 00:07:02,288
Look, I'm sorry, Ma. I just...

89
00:07:02,372 --> 00:07:05,583
I got so caught up in this DJ stuff,
I forgot.

90
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:07,293
You have a child, Andre.

91
00:07:07,877 --> 00:07:10,630
Spinnin' records ain't paying
none of the bills around here.

92
00:07:10,713 --> 00:07:12,757
Whatchu talkin' about? I get paid.

93
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,469
$50. So that makes you rich?

94
00:07:16,553 --> 00:07:18,221
It's a start. Damn!

95
00:07:18,263 --> 00:07:19,597
Why you riding me so hard?

96
00:07:19,681 --> 00:07:22,767
I'm not riding you, baby.
I'm trying to make you understand.

97
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,144
And you know how I run my house.

98
00:07:25,228 --> 00:07:28,398
Now you gonna have to go to school
or you gonna have to go to work.

99
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:30,400
Now I don't even care if you are a janitor.

100
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:31,734
I don't care what the hell you do...

101
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:34,070
Long as I own the company. I know, I know.

102
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:35,905
But you don't own the company.

103
00:07:35,947 --> 00:07:37,490
- Lonzo does.
- Okay.

104
00:07:38,867 --> 00:07:40,410
You think we're done here?

105
00:07:40,451 --> 00:07:42,537
- Yeah, I mean, you keep...
- You got something to say to me?

106
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:44,831
You don't care what I'm fightin' for, okay?

107
00:07:45,874 --> 00:07:47,750
I already know what
I want to do with my life

108
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:49,919
and it definitely ain't
sitting in some cubicle,

109
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:52,088
taking orders on a bullshit-ass job.

110
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:53,339
Shut up!

111
00:07:56,885 --> 00:08:00,471
People used to tell me
I was too young when I had you.

112
00:08:00,555 --> 00:08:02,682
Said I wouldn't be shit.

113
00:08:02,765 --> 00:08:04,142
Said you wouldn't be shit.

114
00:08:05,268 --> 00:08:07,770
Now, I worked my ass off to get us here,

115
00:08:07,812 --> 00:08:10,857
and I refuse to let you throw it all away.

116
00:08:32,253 --> 00:08:34,047
Hey, I grabbed some of your stuff.

117
00:08:34,756 --> 00:08:36,466
Good lookin' out, T.

118
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:43,514
When you comin' back?

119
00:08:44,807 --> 00:08:46,184
Man, I don't even know.

120
00:08:46,643 --> 00:08:48,645
Got a lotta things to figure out.

121
00:08:49,646 --> 00:08:51,481
Can I come with you?

122
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,233
Really?

123
00:08:53,316 --> 00:08:55,235
You've been crying this whole time
about us sharing a room.

124
00:08:55,318 --> 00:08:57,820
And now you wanna come with me.

125
00:08:57,862 --> 00:08:58,863
Man, get out of here.

126
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,448
You know Mom. She just...

127
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,700
She just want the best for you.

128
00:09:04,702 --> 00:09:06,412
Hey, I know that, T.

129
00:09:06,788 --> 00:09:08,998
But check this out,
I want the best for me too.

130
00:09:09,332 --> 00:09:10,583
Ar'ight?

131
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:12,168
That mean I gotta go.

132
00:09:14,295 --> 00:09:17,173
Look, when I get set up right,

133
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:18,883

134
00:09:18,967 --> 00:09:21,177
Don't even worry about it.
I'mma have you in Miami.

135
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:22,845
For real?

136
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,764
- You gotta get me in Miami.
- Yeah, man.

137
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:27,600
Don't play, man. Get me somewhere.

138
00:09:28,226 --> 00:09:29,602
Hey, I'll call you later.

139
00:09:29,686 --> 00:09:32,564
For now, stay your little
ass outta trouble.

140
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:35,108
Yeah, yeah.

141
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:36,943
Hey, nah. For real.

142
00:09:38,403 --> 00:09:40,321
- Ar'ight, bruh.
- Ar'ight.

143
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,359
What you been up to, Cube?

144
00:10:19,068 --> 00:10:21,112
Shit, writin' rhymes.

145
00:10:21,404 --> 00:10:22,572
You a poet now?

146
00:10:23,072 --> 00:10:24,574
The flyest one you know, nigga.

147
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:28,077
This nigga. Okay. I'll see you.

148
00:10:30,705 --> 00:10:32,665
- Hi, Mr. Davis.
- Hi.

149
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:57,857
I wish
somebody would try me though.

150
00:10:57,941 --> 00:10:59,609
That's all I'm saying. You feel me?

151
00:10:59,651 --> 00:11:01,778
- Hey!
- Shit, nigga! Come here!

152
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,446

Open up the goddamn door, man.

00:11:43,611 --> 00:11:44,821
What's going on?

166
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:45,989
Shut the fuck up, blood.

Y'all niggas ready to die today?

Don't get quiet now.

All that shit

00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,666
What's up with it, huh?

00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:57,917
You didn't think we saw that, huh?

172
00:11:58,001 --> 00:11:59,544
Let me see how you do that shit again.
Let me see.

00:11:59,627 --> 00:12:02,046
I was just playin', man, I swear.

You think niggas out here are playin'? Huh?

Niggas die every day.

00:12:07,176 --> 00:12:09,137
I kill Crips for breakfast.

177
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:12,974
Don't you ever put your motherfucking hands
up on no school bus, nigga.

178
00:12:13,016 --> 00:12:14,267
You understand me?

179
00:12:14,475 --> 00:12:15,560
Yeah.

180
00:12:15,643 --> 00:12:16,686
Yeah.

181
00:12:19,022 --> 00:12:21,190
Y'all motherfuckers need
to gang bang them books

182
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:23,610
instead of tryin' to be
somethin' y'all ain't.

183
00:12:23,985 --> 00:12:25,778
Shit, you never know.

184
00:12:27,864 --> 00:12:31,201
'Cause I might be the one
to kill your motherfucking ass.

185
00:12:32,869 --> 00:12:34,662
Remember me.

186
00:12:34,704 --> 00:12:38,208
O.G. Two Tone, Crenshaw Mafia, blood.

187
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:18,081
Yo, Dre and Jinx in there?

188
00:13:18,122 --> 00:13:19,958
Yup, they in there.

189
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,675
- Hey, Auntie.
- Hi, baby.

190
00:13:28,758 --> 00:13:30,093
- How you doin'?
- Just fine.

191
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,762
- Lavetta, where Dre and Jinx at?
- They're in the back.

192
00:13:33,263 --> 00:13:34,305
Excuse me.

193
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:36,057
Come on. Chill out.

194
00:13:36,099 --> 00:13:37,934
- Hey, little mama.
- Take your nap.

195
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:41,104
Why didn't you say hi?

196
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:48,903
- Wuddup, Cube?
- Wuddup?

197
00:13:58,621 --> 00:13:59,873
Do that shit!

198
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,292
Damn, Dre!

199
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:09,465
Damn.

200
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:15,054
Yeah!

201
00:14:18,141 --> 00:14:19,851
That's right.

202
00:14:28,026 --> 00:14:30,403
Fuck that shit up, Dre!

203
00:14:30,486 --> 00:14:32,280
- Yo.
- That shit was dope, homie!

204
00:14:32,322 --> 00:14:33,990
- What's up, Cube?
- Man!

205
00:14:34,324 --> 00:14:37,243
I had some crazy shit
happen on the bus today.

206
00:14:37,327 --> 00:14:40,079
I had a Crenshaw Mafia O.G. get on the bus,

207
00:14:40,163 --> 00:14:41,706
pulled a gun out on us,

208
00:14:41,789 --> 00:14:44,542
gave a fucking motivational speech
and then bumped out.

209
00:14:44,834 --> 00:14:46,085
The shit was crazy.

210
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,880
You wanna avoid some more crazy shit,

211
00:14:48,963 --> 00:14:51,341
you better not get up
on that stage and fuck up.

212
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,677
Ain't nobody gonna fuck up, man.

213
00:14:56,721 --> 00:14:58,681
- You must be stayin' a while.
- Yup.

214
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:00,767
Mama kicked him out 'cause of that mouth.

215
00:15:01,976 --> 00:15:03,061
Shut your ass up.

216
00:15:03,144 --> 00:15:04,854
She didn't kick me out. I left.

217
00:15:04,896 --> 00:15:06,147
Whatever.

218
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:08,942
That's what
they all say, homie. Right?

219
00:15:09,025 --> 00:15:10,026
You got them rhymes?

220
00:15:10,902 --> 00:15:13,029
Man, I stay with the rhymes.

221
00:15:13,696 --> 00:15:15,740
Man, I'm talkin'
about that hard shit.

222
00:15:15,823 --> 00:15:18,743
- All I write is that hard shit, Dre.
- Okay.

223
00:15:18,826 --> 00:15:20,745
So wassup, man? You ready for Doo-to's?

224
00:15:20,828 --> 00:15:22,205
Shit, is Doo-to's ready for me?

225
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:25,041
You know that's Compton, right?
They got body bags at the door.

226
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:28,503
Okay.

227
00:15:28,545 --> 00:15:29,879
Your ass better bring it,

228
00:15:29,921 --> 00:15:32,882
'cause if you don't,
you might end up in one for real.

229
00:15:33,216 --> 00:15:34,384
Body bag?

230
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:36,094
Man, I don't know about that shit.

231
00:15:36,177 --> 00:15:38,263
Ain't nobody
fucking with you, Jinx.

232
00:15:38,346 --> 00:15:40,807
Stupid, man.
Tell your moms to fix this fucking AC.

233
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:43,268
Man, what are you doing here, homeless?

234
00:15:45,603 --> 00:15:47,063
Get off of me, nigga!

235
00:15:49,857 --> 00:15:53,069
- Fuck you! Get the fuck off me.
- Stay down.

236
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:54,904
We didn't do shit!

237
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:57,907
The fuck you holding me for?
Get the fuck off me!

238
00:15:57,991 --> 00:15:59,033
Where the fuck you going?

239
00:15:59,075 --> 00:16:02,370
Hey, man, I'm just trying to get home, man.
I'm not even doin' nothin'.

240
00:16:02,412 --> 00:16:05,081
Put your fucking hands on top of
your head. Interlace your fingers.

241
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,583
Spread your fucking legs.

242
00:16:06,624 --> 00:16:08,251
You need to stay the fuck down.

243
00:16:08,293 --> 00:16:09,752
Man, this hood is fuckin' hot!

244
00:16:09,794 --> 00:16:10,879
Shut the fuck up!

245
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,589
What the hell is going on out here?

246
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:15,341
Look, these boys,
they all grew up on this block, okay?

247
00:16:15,425 --> 00:16:17,093
- You need to get back in the house.
- That's my son.

248
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:19,596
- That's my... O'Shea! That's my son.
- You need to get back in the house.

249
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,431
- Lady, I'm telling you...
- Damn.

250
00:16:21,472 --> 00:16:23,182
You get back inside, or I promise you,

251
00:16:23,266 --> 00:16:25,018
I will ruin your fuckin' night!

252
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:27,228
Man, you ain't got to talk
to my mom's like that.

253
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,939
Shut the fuck up! Motherfuckin' nigger.

254
00:16:29,981 --> 00:16:31,065
I'm a nigger now?

255
00:16:31,107 --> 00:16:33,443
Wait a minute my ass, motherfucker.

256
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:34,569
Okay.

257
00:16:34,611 --> 00:16:37,030
Officer, can you explain
why you jacking us right now?

258
00:16:37,113 --> 00:16:39,032
Man, I ain't explaining shit to you.

259
00:16:39,115 --> 00:16:40,575
Get the fuck up off the street.

260
00:16:40,617 --> 00:16:43,703
I'm on my property.
I can stand right here. You got that?

261
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:46,581
Son! We right here.

262
00:16:46,664 --> 00:16:48,625
Where you got the fuckin' rocks, homeboy?

263
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,418
Not everybody's slangin' dope, man.

264
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,378
I don't give a fuck! This LAPD.

265
00:16:52,462 --> 00:16:54,422
- I'm the only gangster out here.
- All right.

266
00:16:54,464 --> 00:16:55,840
They all check out.

267
00:16:55,924 --> 00:16:58,301
Check out? Check what, man?
Y'all are just over here fuckin' with us.

268
00:16:58,384 --> 00:16:59,427
Get up.

269
00:16:59,469 --> 00:17:00,887
We got cards on all of 'em anyway.

270
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:02,013
Pick your shit up.

271
00:17:02,096 --> 00:17:03,431
Stay out of trouble, man.

272
00:17:03,473 --> 00:17:04,682
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Get your ass up!

273
00:17:04,766 --> 00:17:07,101
Let's go. Head home.

274
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,519
Stay back.

275
00:17:08,603 --> 00:17:10,438
We ain't doin' shit, man!

276
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,273
Get the fuck outta here.

277
00:17:12,315 --> 00:17:13,399
We didn't even fucking do shit!

278
00:17:13,483 --> 00:17:15,276
Start fuckin' walking.

279
00:17:16,194 --> 00:17:18,279
Hey. Hey. Head home!

280
00:17:18,988 --> 00:17:20,198
O'Shea.

281
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:23,493
Fuck the police, homie!

282
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:26,746
Get the fuck out of here!

283
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:28,790
Yo, this is bullshit!

284
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:39,842
You really want to be here?

285
00:17:41,302 --> 00:17:43,346
This club full of Pirus.

286
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,014
We straight.

287
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:47,058
Yeah, thanks for the tip, homie.

288
00:17:47,141 --> 00:17:48,518
These niggas.

289
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,660
I just wanna say this.
You should be a model.

290
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:08,413
Yeah, you look like a model.

291
00:18:08,496 --> 00:18:10,373
Just sayin', you know.

292
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,418
I look in your eyes and I see a Capricorn.

293
00:18:13,501 --> 00:18:15,044
You're a Capricorn, right?

294
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:19,382
I mean, I can look at a girl
and I know their sign, you know?

295
00:18:20,508 --> 00:18:21,676
It's just something I do.

296
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:26,890
I hope I'm not
disrespecting you, right?

297
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:28,558
- Not at all.
- Good.

298
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:29,767
- Yella!
- Good.

299
00:18:30,351 --> 00:18:31,728
Lonzo coming, man.

300
00:18:39,777 --> 00:18:41,571
Nah, nah. Weak at the Knees.

301
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:43,406
Weak at the Knees.

302
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,741
- Hey.
- Wassup?

303
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:47,202
I'mma go outside and make sure
nothing's poppin' off, all right?

304
00:18:47,243 --> 00:18:48,995
I want you to keep these fat asses shakin'.

305
00:18:49,078 --> 00:18:51,247
Don't play none of that
street-ass rap shit, ar'ight?

306
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:54,083
I want these motherfuckers
to think about pussy, not pistols.

307
00:18:55,043 --> 00:18:56,127
Yella!

308
00:18:56,294 --> 00:18:57,670
I saw you talking to my lady, man.

309
00:18:57,795 --> 00:19:00,298
Keep your motherfuckin' hands to yourself.

310
00:19:00,381 --> 00:19:01,799
All right.

311
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:07,096
Man, why you always fuckin'
with Lonzo's girl, man?

312
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,598
Why not?

313
00:19:09,098 --> 00:19:11,434
I can't be afraid
of a grown man in high heels, Dre.

314
00:19:13,561 --> 00:19:15,688
Cube, you up.

315
00:19:17,815 --> 00:19:19,192
Hey, yo, Compton!

316
00:19:19,275 --> 00:19:20,652
I got my little homie.

317
00:19:20,735 --> 00:19:22,612
He 'bout to come
and bust a little rhyme for y'all.

318
00:19:22,654 --> 00:19:23,738
I want y'all to give it up

319
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:27,575
for Ice-motherfuckin'-Cube!

320
00:19:27,617 --> 00:19:29,857
Here's a little
somethin' 'bout a nigga like me

321
00:19:29,911 --> 00:19:32,622
Never shoulda been let out the penitentiary

322
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:34,290
Ice Cube would like to say

323
00:19:34,332 --> 00:19:37,126
That I'm a crazy mutherfucka
from around the way

324
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,879
Since I was a youth I smoked weed out

325
00:19:39,963 --> 00:19:42,006
Now I'm the mutherfucka that you read about

326
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:43,299
Takin' a life or two

327
00:19:43,341 --> 00:19:44,634
That's what the hell I do

328
00:19:44,676 --> 00:19:47,011
You don't like how I'm
livin' well, fuck you!

329
00:19:47,095 --> 00:19:49,264
This is a gang and I'm in it

330
00:19:49,305 --> 00:19:51,349
My man Dre'll fuck you up in a minute

331
00:19:51,432 --> 00:19:52,517
With a right left

332
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,227
Right, left you're toothless

333
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,688
And then you say goddamn they ruthless

334
00:19:56,771 --> 00:19:59,023
Everywhere we go they say damn!

335
00:19:59,107 --> 00:20:01,442
Ice Cube's fuckin' up the program

336
00:20:01,484 --> 00:20:04,487
And then you realize we don't care
We don't just say no

337
00:20:04,529 --> 00:20:06,322
We too busy sayin' yeah!

338
00:20:06,364 --> 00:20:08,741
About drinkin' straight
out the eight bottle

339
00:20:08,825 --> 00:20:11,244
Do I look like a motherfuckin' role model?

340
00:20:11,327 --> 00:20:13,329
To a kid lookin' up to me

341
00:20:13,371 --> 00:20:15,665
Life ain't nothin' but bitches and money

342
00:20:15,707 --> 00:20:18,001
'Cause I'm tha type of
nigga that's built to last

343
00:20:18,042 --> 00:20:20,795
If you fuck with me
I'll put my foot in your ass

344
00:20:20,837 --> 00:20:23,590
I don't give a fuck 'cause I keep bailin'

345
00:20:23,673 --> 00:20:25,717
Yo, what the fuck are they yellin'?

346
00:20:30,638 --> 00:20:33,266
- Fucking right! I told you. I told you.
- Yes, you did.

347
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:40,857
That's what I'm talking about, man.

348
00:20:41,357 --> 00:20:43,735
Now, see, I'm this close
to firing your monkey ass.

349
00:20:43,818 --> 00:20:45,987
What, you trying to start
a riot up in here?

350
00:20:46,029 --> 00:20:49,532
I told you. Didn't I tell you I don't want
that hardcore shit played in my club?

351
00:20:49,574 --> 00:20:51,659
As soon as I turn my back,
you do that shit anyway.

352
00:20:51,701 --> 00:20:53,912
I'm just trying to help
your business out, Lonzo.

353
00:20:53,995 --> 00:20:55,538
You saw they went crazy for that shit.

354
00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:56,873
Don't worry about my business, ar'ight?

355
00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:59,626
You just remember,
the only reason you up on that stage

356
00:20:59,709 --> 00:21:02,045
is 'cause I put you up
on that motherfuckin' stage.

357
00:21:02,086 --> 00:21:05,423
Now, you a badass DJ, I'll give you that,
but you don't like to listen, Dre.

358
00:21:05,506 --> 00:21:07,383
And I get tired of arguing all the time.

359
00:21:07,425 --> 00:21:09,219
'Cause you know,
there's a lot of cats that'll come in here

360
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,095
and they'll play exactly
what I want 'em to play.

361
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:12,472
Like that shit right there.

362
00:21:12,555 --> 00:21:16,476
Cats that understand that you don't
bite the hand that feeds you.

363
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,561
Now you take a backseat
to that shit, nigga.

364
00:21:18,603 --> 00:21:20,563
These fucking marching jackets and shit.

365
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:23,127
Marching my ass. You march
your ass and do what the fuck I say.

366
00:21:23,191 --> 00:21:24,984
Hey, Dre.

367
00:21:26,736 --> 00:21:28,571
Don't even trip on him, homie.

368
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,783
Nigga ain't got no fucking vision, man.

369
00:21:31,866 --> 00:21:34,410
That's why I'mma fuck his bitch.
After he leave.

370
00:21:34,494 --> 00:21:36,579
Not with that shit on.

371
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:40,667
How you liking this little spot? Hey!

372
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:43,461
Dr. Dre.

373
00:21:43,545 --> 00:21:45,213
Wassup, E?

374
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:47,090
It's been a minute, man.

375
00:21:47,549 --> 00:21:49,759
I love your jacket, by the way.

376
00:21:50,051 --> 00:21:51,719
You baggin' on me.

377
00:21:51,761 --> 00:21:54,097
You know I don't like wearing this shit.

378
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:56,933
That's Lonzo's shit, man.
You know it's part of the gig.

379
00:21:56,975 --> 00:21:59,602
Yeah. You remember
the homie Ren from Kelly Park, right?

380
00:21:59,894 --> 00:22:01,271
- Wassup?
- Wuddup, Dre?

381
00:22:01,312 --> 00:22:02,355
- Wuddup?
- Wassup, man?

382
00:22:02,438 --> 00:22:04,357
Look, I heard you been, um,

383
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,776
spending some time at your auntie's house.

384
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:08,820
How's the couch life?

385
00:22:10,905 --> 00:22:11,948
It's fucked up.

386
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,449
I'm too tall for that shit.

387
00:22:13,491 --> 00:22:16,411
Plus I got my woman and baby livin' there.
It's hard, man.

388
00:22:16,578 --> 00:22:18,121
But you know,
everybody can't do what you do.

389
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:20,582
Yeah, Dre. Well, what I do
gettin' played out quick, man.

390
00:22:20,623 --> 00:22:23,384
Motherfuckers just getting locked up
and laid down out here, you know?

391
00:22:23,418 --> 00:22:25,211
I gotta make some changes.

392
00:22:25,295 --> 00:22:26,963
Changes ain't bad.

393
00:22:27,005 --> 00:22:29,382
I'm thinking about
making a few changes myself.

394
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:30,967
Whatcha mean?

395
00:22:33,303 --> 00:22:35,972
Whatchu think about
dumping some money into this music shit?

396
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,099
Look, I got some ideas.

397
00:22:38,141 --> 00:22:39,392
Let's give it up for Dr. Dre.

398
00:22:39,475 --> 00:22:41,769
Fuck! I gotta get back up there.

399
00:22:41,811 --> 00:22:43,855
That's your calling, man.

400
00:22:43,938 --> 00:22:46,232
Tell Lonzo I said, "Fuck him." Ar'ight.

401
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:48,401
Hey, E.

402
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:50,612
Think about it.

403
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,113
Ar'ight.

404
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:56,075
Wassup? Do I know you?

405
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,285
What?

406
00:22:57,327 --> 00:22:59,287
- Get 'em up.
- Hell no!

407
00:22:59,329 --> 00:23:01,623
Hey, don't be fuckin'
with my little brother, nigga!

408
00:23:01,664 --> 00:23:03,166
What the fuck did he do?

409
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:05,668
Nigga lookin' at me
like he know me or somethin'.

410
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,837
Man, I told you about this shit!

411
00:23:07,879 --> 00:23:10,423
- Clear the parking lot.
- I told you to go the fuck home.

412
00:23:10,506 --> 00:23:11,841
The fuck wrong with you, man?

413
00:23:11,925 --> 00:23:13,885
You better chill the fuck out.

414
00:23:14,385 --> 00:23:15,595
One time.

415
00:23:18,389 --> 00:23:21,017
Hey! We told everybody
to clear this parking lot!

416
00:23:21,684 --> 00:23:23,102
We just standing here.

417
00:23:23,186 --> 00:23:24,187
Get outta here!

418
00:23:24,229 --> 00:23:25,230
What's going on?

419
00:23:25,313 --> 00:23:26,522
Hey! Head home.

420
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:28,024
I fell.

421
00:23:28,524 --> 00:23:30,610
You fell? He fell?

422
00:23:31,694 --> 00:23:32,946
That's what he said.

423
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:35,031
I didn't ask you what he said.

424
00:23:35,323 --> 00:23:36,824
Get the fuck home!

425
00:23:38,952 --> 00:23:40,370
I am home.

426
00:23:40,787 --> 00:23:42,914
Head home. Go!

427
00:23:46,543 --> 00:23:48,461
If you don't start walking...

428
00:23:50,463 --> 00:23:51,923
Or what?

429
00:23:52,006 --> 00:23:54,175
Turn around. Hands on your head.

430
00:23:54,842 --> 00:23:56,094
Come here.

431
00:23:59,556 --> 00:24:02,559
You have the right to remain silent.

432
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,061
Stop resisting, boy.

433
00:24:07,438 --> 00:24:09,399
You already know what it is.

434
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:31,045
- What up, sucker-punch?
- You already know what it is.

435
00:24:31,504 --> 00:24:33,673
Sucker punched that dude, man.

436
00:24:33,756 --> 00:24:35,800
Hey, man, nah, nah, nah. That was Tyree.

437
00:24:35,884 --> 00:24:37,427
You know he got that temper and shit.

438
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,512
Always getting me into
fucking trouble, man.

439
00:24:39,596 --> 00:24:41,264
So what they lock you up for?

440
00:24:41,764 --> 00:24:45,435
I was literally just standing there, man.
That's it.

441
00:24:46,603 --> 00:24:47,770
As far as they was concerned.

442
00:24:47,854 --> 00:24:49,772
That's the gangsterist
shit I heard all week.

443
00:24:49,814 --> 00:24:51,858
Man, it's stupid.

444
00:24:52,442 --> 00:24:55,278
But I was thinking about what you
was saying last night, though, man.

445
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:58,781
Oh, yeah? And?

446
00:24:59,782 --> 00:25:01,117
It's interesting.

447
00:25:01,201 --> 00:25:02,327
How long?

448
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:05,538
Really, like, how long do you think that
shit you doing out there gonna last?

449
00:25:05,622 --> 00:25:08,082
'Cause it ain't no happy endings
in that game, man.

450
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:09,751
You saying a lot for a nigga

451
00:25:09,792 --> 00:25:11,753
who just got bailed outta jail.

452
00:25:12,128 --> 00:25:14,464
I'm just saying, if you can slang dope...

453
00:25:14,505 --> 00:25:16,007
- Nigga!
- What, man?

454
00:25:16,299 --> 00:25:18,099
Just tell the whole fuckin'
world I sell dope.

455
00:25:18,134 --> 00:25:21,846
Yo, yo. You can slang dope,
you can slang records, man. It's easy.

456
00:25:22,263 --> 00:25:24,224
You got a mind for that shit, E.

457
00:25:24,641 --> 00:25:26,809
So whatchu talking about doing?
Lil' homie from last night?

458
00:25:26,851 --> 00:25:28,811
Nah, man. He in a group.

459
00:25:28,853 --> 00:25:30,772
You know, they a trip, but...

460
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:35,944
But that shit, the reality raps,
that's what I'm talking about, man.

461
00:25:35,985 --> 00:25:37,195
That's it.

462
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:39,614
My boy, D.O.C.,
he coming in from Dallas, dope.

463
00:25:41,366 --> 00:25:42,909
My little homie, Ren, rap too.

464
00:25:42,992 --> 00:25:43,993
Oh, yeah?

465
00:25:44,035 --> 00:25:47,956
Hey, look, I got these cats,
H.B.O., Home Boys Only

466
00:25:47,997 --> 00:25:51,167
from New York, dope voices, man.

467
00:25:51,543 --> 00:25:52,961
Some whack-ass lyrics, though.

468
00:25:55,463 --> 00:25:58,841
I'm saying, Cube,
he wrote this shit for 'em, it's crazy.

469
00:25:59,676 --> 00:26:01,844
Shit, we could probably
do something with that.

470
00:26:02,178 --> 00:26:05,348
That's what I'm saying, man.
Start a label or something, man.

471
00:26:05,682 --> 00:26:06,849
A label?

472
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,935
That's kinda fucking far-fetched, Dre.

473
00:26:09,018 --> 00:26:10,853
Yeah, but check this out,

474
00:26:10,895 --> 00:26:13,189
what would you call a
record label like that?

475
00:26:20,196 --> 00:26:21,531
Ruthless.

476
00:26:21,864 --> 00:26:23,241
Ruthless?

477
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:28,580
- Just like these fucking police, nigga.
- Ruthless.

478
00:26:28,663 --> 00:26:31,499
Let's get the fuck from around here.
Trying to get me sent to jail.

479
00:26:31,541 --> 00:26:33,334
Get your simple ass in the car.

480
00:26:39,549 --> 00:26:42,552
What the fuck is "gankin"?
And what's a "6-4"?

481
00:26:42,635 --> 00:26:45,930
- Yeah.
- It's a car. A 6-4 Impala.

482
00:26:46,514 --> 00:26:48,725
"Ganking" is when you jack somebody, man.

483
00:26:48,808 --> 00:26:50,894
It's not a big deal.
The shit just sound better.

484
00:26:50,935 --> 00:26:53,855
Yo, man, it's too much
cursing for radio play.

485
00:26:53,897 --> 00:26:56,482
I mean, besides, who gives a fuck
about Compton anyway? Right?

486
00:26:56,566 --> 00:26:58,818
Hold the fuck up. Hey. Hold up, man.

487
00:27:01,321 --> 00:27:02,947
Hey, y'all got something
to say about Compton?

488
00:27:03,031 --> 00:27:05,074
'Cause we might have a problem
up in this bitch.

489
00:27:09,162 --> 00:27:11,873
No? Then do the lyrics,

490
00:27:11,915 --> 00:27:14,459
'cause I'm really losing my patience,
ar'ight?

491
00:27:14,542 --> 00:27:16,169
Stop fucking embarrassing me, man.

492
00:27:16,252 --> 00:27:17,545
Hey, man. I ain't with this shit.

493
00:27:17,587 --> 00:27:18,630
Yeah, man. Fuck this shit.

494
00:27:18,713 --> 00:27:21,007
- Fuck this Jheri curl rap bullshit, man.
- Where y'all going?

495
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:24,135
Fuck you! Wearing a Kangol
don't make you LL Cool J, nigga.

496
00:27:24,219 --> 00:27:26,596
What the fuck you gonna do about it?
Whatcha gonna do, mark-ass nigga?

497
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:27,680
Hey.

498
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,863
Let's roll, B.

499
00:27:47,408 --> 00:27:48,618
B-street-looking motherfucker.

500
00:27:48,701 --> 00:27:49,953
Fucking Jheri curl ass.

501
00:27:49,994 --> 00:27:52,664
Keep talkin' that bullshit
on your way out the door, nigga.

502
00:28:01,381 --> 00:28:02,590
Well, there goes the talent, Dre.

503
00:28:02,632 --> 00:28:03,800
Shut the fuck up, E.

504
00:28:04,801 --> 00:28:06,970
- I'm saying...
- Come on, man.

505
00:28:07,011 --> 00:28:09,973
How the fuck we suppose
to make a record label and hit records

506
00:28:10,056 --> 00:28:11,724
and we ain't got no talent?

507
00:28:12,809 --> 00:28:16,271
I mean, you said, hold up my side of
the deal. You said, put some money up.

508
00:28:17,063 --> 00:28:19,023
So, it's time for you to deliver.

509
00:28:24,612 --> 00:28:26,531
Why don't you do this shit, E?

510
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:29,075
Nah, for real.
Get in there on the mic.

511
00:28:29,158 --> 00:28:32,829
You ain't got shit to lose.
It's your money. You paying for it.

512
00:28:32,912 --> 00:28:36,541
No, I can't. 'Cause I'm not a rapper.
There's your rapper.

513
00:28:36,624 --> 00:28:37,917
I'm in a group already, man.

514
00:28:38,001 --> 00:28:40,128
Jinx and them
would trip on me if I do anything.

515
00:28:40,169 --> 00:28:42,672
Look, I understand
that you wanna keep throwing your life away

516
00:28:42,714 --> 00:28:44,883
with Jinx and the backyard
boogie band or whatever...

517
00:28:44,966 --> 00:28:47,176
But I'm the Berry Gordy of this shit.

518
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:50,096
So, whenever y'all figure out
what y'all wanna do,

519
00:28:50,179 --> 00:28:51,306
just let me know.

520
00:28:52,015 --> 00:28:55,184
Come on, man.
Look, the song is about you, E.

521
00:28:55,226 --> 00:28:58,187
Eazy-motherfuckin'-E. I'm telling you.

522
00:28:58,354 --> 00:29:00,398
Come on, man.

523
00:29:00,481 --> 00:29:01,983
You the only muthafucka with a 6-4.

524
00:29:02,025 --> 00:29:04,027
- You got a 6-4?
- I don't have a car.

525
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,194
You got a 6-4?

526
00:29:05,236 --> 00:29:06,237
I got a po' Porsche, man.

527
00:29:06,321 --> 00:29:07,906
Nigga, come on, man.

528
00:29:09,198 --> 00:29:10,575
You ain't doing nothing.

529
00:29:13,203 --> 00:29:15,705
But you the business man,
so, you know.

530
00:29:15,872 --> 00:29:17,207
It's on you.

531
00:29:17,916 --> 00:29:19,959
We got a cool-ass song, though.

532
00:29:21,044 --> 00:29:22,879
I think you could hit that shit.

533
00:29:25,924 --> 00:29:27,342
I'm not sold, Dre.

534
00:29:27,383 --> 00:29:29,802
Whatchu mean, you not sold?
You just gonna sit there?

535
00:29:30,553 --> 00:29:32,680
You're kinda being a ho right now, Eric.

536
00:29:35,975 --> 00:29:38,019
Fuck y'all, niggas.

537
00:29:38,061 --> 00:29:39,729
Berry Gordy to save the day.

538
00:29:39,771 --> 00:29:40,772
I ain't scared.

539
00:29:40,855 --> 00:29:42,440
- You ain't scared?
- What's up then?

540
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:44,525
What are you doing?

541
00:29:44,567 --> 00:29:47,278
E, let me produce. Man.

542
00:29:48,905 --> 00:29:50,198
Feel like it's getting weird.

543
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,075
Man, shut up and get comfortable.

544
00:29:52,575 --> 00:29:53,743
Let's go.

545
00:29:56,538 --> 00:29:59,249
Cruisin' down the street in my 6-4

546
00:29:59,916 --> 00:30:01,042
Shit.

547
00:30:01,084 --> 00:30:02,252
The fuck?

548
00:30:05,588 --> 00:30:07,632
What the fuck is so funny?

549
00:30:07,715 --> 00:30:09,717
Nothing. Oh, E, can you hear me?

550
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:12,762
Yeah, I can hear you
and how much y'all fucking laughing.

551
00:30:12,804 --> 00:30:16,349
Hey, E, you good.
Just hit that first beat hard, man.

552
00:30:16,432 --> 00:30:18,226
You gotta come in on beat.

553
00:30:18,268 --> 00:30:19,769
Cruisin' down the street

554
00:30:19,852 --> 00:30:21,479
You cruisin'.

555
00:30:21,563 --> 00:30:23,273
- You good, Eric.
- All right?

556
00:30:23,314 --> 00:30:25,066
No, no, no, no. You good, you good.

557
00:30:25,108 --> 00:30:28,111
It's dope. But on beat.

558
00:30:28,152 --> 00:30:30,446
Again. All right? Let's go.

559
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:32,532
You cruising. All right?

560
00:30:38,955 --> 00:30:41,499
Cruisin' down the street in my 6-4

561
00:30:41,958 --> 00:30:43,710
- Shit.
- That ain't it.

562
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,503
- It really ain't.
- Hey, hey, Dre.

563
00:30:45,587 --> 00:30:48,047
He gotta go if we're gonna do this.
Cube, you gotta go.

564
00:30:48,131 --> 00:30:49,371
Get the fuck outta here, Yella.

565
00:30:49,424 --> 00:30:50,842
- He not talkin' to me.
- Nah, nigga, both of y'all.

566
00:30:50,925 --> 00:30:51,968
You talking to me?

567
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:53,344
- Bye.
- Go, Cube.

568
00:30:53,428 --> 00:30:54,804
- And Yella, get the fuck outta here, man.
- Me too?

569
00:30:54,846 --> 00:30:55,972
Yeah, so we can get this shit done.

570
00:30:56,014 --> 00:30:58,892
Write the song, Cube.
Shut the fuck up, Cube.

571
00:30:58,975 --> 00:31:01,019
- Take these with you, Cube.
- What'd I do?

572
00:31:01,102 --> 00:31:03,187
- For real?
- Yes, man. Come on.

573
00:31:03,271 --> 00:31:05,523
You know what? Whatever. Whatever.

574
00:31:06,983 --> 00:31:08,318
You motherfucker.

575
00:31:08,401 --> 00:31:09,694
- Come on, E.
- You finished, Dre?

576
00:31:09,777 --> 00:31:12,655
You wanna laugh too?
I stay in this bitch by myself.

577
00:31:12,697 --> 00:31:13,865
Hey, just say the words, ar'ight?

578
00:31:13,948 --> 00:31:14,991
What does that even mean?

579
00:31:15,074 --> 00:31:17,535
Man, just say the shit with me.
Ar'ight? Cruisin'.

580
00:31:17,619 --> 00:31:18,620
Cruisin'.

581
00:31:18,661 --> 00:31:20,622
Yeah, "Cruisin'". Let's go.

582
00:31:26,002 --> 00:31:29,047
Dre, you know this shit
ain't gonna never work

583
00:31:29,881 --> 00:31:31,883
A'ight. You trying to be funny.

584
00:31:31,966 --> 00:31:34,219
But, you see how you said that shit, right?
Like you believe it.

585
00:31:34,302 --> 00:31:35,428
Yeah, I believe that shit.

586
00:31:35,511 --> 00:31:37,388
Then say this shit like
you believe it, man.

587
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,182
Like it's a motherfuckin' Sunday

588
00:31:39,224 --> 00:31:42,101
and you cruisin' down Crenshaw
in a motherfuckin' 6-4.

589
00:31:42,185 --> 00:31:45,021
Come on. Say that shit like you believe it,
man, like it's your words.

590
00:31:45,104 --> 00:31:46,189
Feel that shit.

591
00:31:46,272 --> 00:31:48,024
Stop playing around. Loosen the fuck up.

592
00:31:48,066 --> 00:31:49,192
There you go.

593
00:31:55,406 --> 00:31:58,076
Cruisin' down the street in my 6-4

594
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,538
Oh, shit. Hey, that was dope, E.

595
00:32:01,621 --> 00:32:04,499
That shit was dope, man. Yeah.

596
00:32:04,541 --> 00:32:06,960
That's what I'm talking about, man.

597
00:32:07,043 --> 00:32:08,920
You feelin' that shit, right?

598
00:32:09,003 --> 00:32:12,465
Now we only got 59 more lines
to punch in, but it's all good.

599
00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:15,176
We gonna get through it.
Let's go on to the next one.

600
00:32:31,067 --> 00:32:32,485
My man didn't budge

601
00:32:32,569 --> 00:32:35,029
Bailiff came over to turn him in

602
00:32:35,071 --> 00:32:38,116
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin

603
00:32:38,199 --> 00:32:40,660
He yelled out "fire!" then came Suzy

604
00:32:40,743 --> 00:32:43,413
The bitch came in with a submachine Uzi

605
00:32:43,496 --> 00:32:46,249
Police shot the girl but didn't hurt her

606
00:32:46,332 --> 00:32:48,668
Both upstate for attempted murder

607
00:32:48,751 --> 00:32:51,421
'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard

608
00:32:51,462 --> 00:32:54,007
You come talking that trash
we'll pull your card

609
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:56,759
Knowing nothing in life but to be legit

610
00:32:56,801 --> 00:32:59,637
Don't quote me,
boy 'cause I ain't said shit

611
00:33:03,766 --> 00:33:04,893
Yes.

612
00:33:04,934 --> 00:33:06,102
All right, Eazy.

613
00:33:06,227 --> 00:33:07,645
Hell yes, Dre!

614
00:33:07,729 --> 00:33:09,105
- Yeah?
- Yes.

615
00:33:09,188 --> 00:33:10,607
Hey, D.O.C.

616
00:33:11,941 --> 00:33:13,026
Whatchu think, man?

617
00:33:13,109 --> 00:33:14,777
You think they gonna feel

618
00:33:14,861 --> 00:33:17,655
Man, to be honest, man,
that shit is super dope, nigga.

619
00:33:17,739 --> 00:33:19,574
- Hell yeah!
- For real, nigga.

620
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:22,619
Hey, Lonzo. Whatchu think?

621
00:33:24,537 --> 00:33:26,456
Sound like some waste-of-time shit to me.

622
00:33:26,831 --> 00:33:29,083
Look, trust me, this shit
ain't gonna work, ar'ight?

623
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:31,002
You ain't gonna get no radio play
with that shit right there.

624
00:33:31,085 --> 00:33:32,879
- Oh, for real?
- Oh, for very real.

625
00:33:32,962 --> 00:33:34,297
Y'all need to wrap this shit up too

626
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,716
'cause I need you to get back
on that slow jam that we talked about.

627
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:39,552
This whole reality of rap
shit y'all tryin' to do.

628
00:33:39,636 --> 00:33:42,138
Talkin' about low-riders and jail,
nobody wanna hear that shit.

629
00:33:42,222 --> 00:33:45,225
Now you need to get back in there and
work on that slow jam that we worked on.

630
00:33:45,308 --> 00:33:46,309
And I'm serious

631
00:33:46,392 --> 00:33:49,520
about all you motherfuckers taking up
my time and that's coming outta your pay.

632
00:33:49,604 --> 00:33:51,648
No disrespect, Eazy,
'cause I know you real.

633
00:33:51,731 --> 00:33:53,900
But you, motherfucker,
I ain't gonna take that shit from you.

634
00:33:53,983 --> 00:33:55,944
20 years from now,
you gonna fucking thank me. Watch.

635
00:33:55,985 --> 00:33:57,705
Nigga, 20 years
from now, you still gonna be

636
00:33:57,779 --> 00:34:00,114
recording love songs
in this dusty-ass garage.

637
00:34:01,324 --> 00:34:02,367
Fuck outta here.

638
00:34:03,368 --> 00:34:04,869
Wrap this shit up.

639
00:34:05,662 --> 00:34:07,664
Yeah. Okay. You got it.

640
00:34:07,747 --> 00:34:09,165
No, you got it!

641
00:34:13,294 --> 00:34:14,837
- Yes!
- I told you. Didn't I tell you?

642
00:34:14,921 --> 00:34:16,506
You told me, man. I should've believed you.

643
00:34:16,589 --> 00:34:19,469
What the fuck did you all get from that
that you're high-fiving and shit?

644
00:34:19,842 --> 00:34:22,178
Cube. Man, if Lonzo think
it ain't gonna be shit,

645
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,888
we know we got a motherfucking hit!

646
00:34:23,972 --> 00:34:25,348
- Exactly.
- For real.

647
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:26,391
'Cause he don't know shit about music.

648
00:34:26,516 --> 00:34:28,556
He don't know good music
when he hears it.

649
00:34:28,601 --> 00:34:29,936
Play that shit again!

650
00:34:30,019 --> 00:34:31,062
Dre...

651
00:34:31,145 --> 00:34:34,190
You a fucking genius. You a fucking genius.

652
00:34:34,232 --> 00:34:36,067
Went to the park to get the scoop

653
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:39,153
Knuckleheads out there
cold shooting some hoops

654
00:34:39,237 --> 00:34:41,281
A car pulls up
Who can it be?

655
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:44,117
A fresh El Camino rollin', Kilo G

656
00:34:44,492 --> 00:34:47,036
He rolled down his window
And he started to say

657
00:34:47,203 --> 00:34:49,998
It's all about makin' that GTA

658
00:34:50,081 --> 00:34:52,292
'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard

659
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:55,044
You come talking that trash
we'll pull your card

660
00:34:55,211 --> 00:34:57,630
Knowing nothing in life but to be legit

661
00:34:57,714 --> 00:34:59,757
Don't quote me,
boy 'cause I ain't said shit

662
00:35:18,234 --> 00:35:19,611
Thank you.

663
00:35:21,738 --> 00:35:23,489
These phones are burning up.

664
00:35:23,573 --> 00:35:25,950
This is 1580 KDAY.

665
00:35:26,034 --> 00:35:27,702
This is Greg Mack with the Mack Attack,

666
00:35:27,744 --> 00:35:29,996
and I gotta give it up to my boy, Dr. Dre,

667
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,458
who is coming
with Compton's very own Eazy-E.

668
00:35:33,541 --> 00:35:35,418
And you're listening to Boyz-N-The Hood

669
00:35:35,501 --> 00:35:37,420
the number-one requested song

670
00:35:37,462 --> 00:35:39,214
for six weeks and counting.

671
00:35:43,134 --> 00:35:45,470
Ar'ight. Guess I'll see you soon.

672
00:35:45,553 --> 00:35:46,596
Excuse me.

673
00:35:46,638 --> 00:35:48,932
- Yeah?
- I heard your record.

674
00:35:50,141 --> 00:35:51,601
I'm Jerry Heller.

675
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,186
Eric Wright.

676
00:35:53,269 --> 00:35:55,438
Real pleasure to meet you, man.

677
00:35:55,521 --> 00:35:56,648
Same here.

678
00:35:56,731 --> 00:35:57,899
Uh, would it...

679
00:35:58,775 --> 00:36:01,903
Here, let me get those for you.
Let me get those for you.

680
00:36:01,945 --> 00:36:05,782
Would it be possible
to have a word with you for a second, Eric?

681
00:36:05,865 --> 00:36:07,116
About what?

682
00:36:07,784 --> 00:36:09,244
About music.

683
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:12,497
After you.

684
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,457
All right. Come on.

685
00:36:20,964 --> 00:36:23,132
So, I thought your album was good, man.

686
00:36:23,174 --> 00:36:24,300
Just good?

687
00:36:28,721 --> 00:36:30,348
Hey, hey, hey, hey! No.

688
00:36:30,431 --> 00:36:32,058
I thought it was exceptional.

689
00:36:32,725 --> 00:36:33,810
- Exceptional?
- Yes.

690
00:36:33,851 --> 00:36:36,479
Fantastic.
Please, just sit down, all right?

691
00:36:36,563 --> 00:36:38,898
We'll start this again. Come on.

692
00:36:39,399 --> 00:36:44,571
All right. I'm gonna try this again. Okay?

693
00:36:44,654 --> 00:36:45,989
All right.

694
00:36:48,116 --> 00:36:51,327
As a music manager, let me tell
you what I can do for you, Eric.

695
00:36:51,452 --> 00:36:53,872
I will make you legit.

696
00:36:53,955 --> 00:36:57,792
It seems as if I could
do something for you.

697
00:37:00,962 --> 00:37:03,631
I see. You think because
I don't have some flashy office

698
00:37:03,673 --> 00:37:05,174
I don't know what I'm talking about?

699
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:08,803
I worked with Elton John.
I worked with Otis Redding.

700
00:37:08,845 --> 00:37:13,808
Let me see.
I worked with War. I worked with Styx.

701
00:37:13,933 --> 00:37:17,979
- I worked with, uh...
- Have you worked with anybody this decade?

702
00:37:19,606 --> 00:37:21,232
Okay.

703
00:37:22,191 --> 00:37:24,861
Let me tell you what I see here, Eric.

704
00:37:26,195 --> 00:37:30,700
A lot of raw talent, a lot of braggadocio.

705
00:37:30,992 --> 00:37:32,493
Bravado.

706
00:37:32,535 --> 00:37:34,662
But if you think anyone's
gonna talk to you,

707
00:37:34,704 --> 00:37:37,081
you think anyone
is gonna let you in the building

708
00:37:37,165 --> 00:37:40,293
where somebody might listen to you or talk
to you, you think that's gonna happen?

709
00:37:40,376 --> 00:37:42,962
You're crazy, man. I'm sorry.

710
00:37:43,796 --> 00:37:45,548
That is what I can do for you.

711
00:37:45,965 --> 00:37:47,842
I can make you legit.

712
00:37:48,301 --> 00:37:51,888
I can get you in that building.
And I will protect you.

713
00:37:51,971 --> 00:37:55,892
I will block out all the noise
of this crazy fuckin' business

714
00:37:56,059 --> 00:37:57,894
and we can build something big.

715
00:37:58,394 --> 00:38:01,856
But you gotta believe in me
the way that I believe in you.

716
00:38:02,398 --> 00:38:04,192
The way that I believe in this,

717
00:38:04,234 --> 00:38:06,819
because you have a unique talent, Eric.

718
00:38:06,903 --> 00:38:08,071
Very special.

719
00:38:08,154 --> 00:38:09,864
Don't fuck around.

720
00:38:11,658 --> 00:38:13,618
But, you know what?

721
00:38:15,411 --> 00:38:16,871
If you can't handle it,

722
00:38:16,913 --> 00:38:20,166
if it's too much fuckin' pressure
for you, then fine.

723
00:38:20,917 --> 00:38:22,252
Get outta here.

724
00:38:22,418 --> 00:38:25,630
Wait. I'm listening.

725
00:38:30,718 --> 00:38:32,720
You got more music for me?

726
00:38:36,015 --> 00:38:37,392
- Absolutely.
- Good.

727
00:38:37,934 --> 00:38:42,730
'Cause you are gonna
have to follow this up, quick. All right?

728
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:45,942
Now, what does N.W.A stand for, huh?

729
00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:49,779
No Whites Allowed? Something like that?

730
00:38:49,862 --> 00:38:51,072
Nah.

731
00:38:52,156 --> 00:38:53,700
Niggas With Attitudes.

732
00:38:58,204 --> 00:38:59,497
You're fucking kidding me.

733
00:39:03,751 --> 00:39:06,254
All right. We can work with that.

734
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:10,925
- Good. I like that. I like that a lot.
- You better.

735
00:39:14,429 --> 00:39:15,805
Fantastic.

736
00:39:16,514 --> 00:39:17,974
Fantastic.

737
00:39:41,456 --> 00:39:43,917
What up, what up? What's up, fam?

738
00:39:48,838 --> 00:39:50,131
- Hey.
- What's up, baby?

739
00:39:50,215 --> 00:39:51,674
Dre.

740
00:39:56,679 --> 00:39:59,015
Hey, fellas, y'all got any idea

741
00:39:59,098 --> 00:40:01,017
why I asked y'all to
wear all black tonight?

742
00:40:01,142 --> 00:40:02,560
'Cause we a all-star group.

743
00:40:02,644 --> 00:40:04,354
And to be a all-star group

744
00:40:04,395 --> 00:40:05,855
we gotta look like it,

745
00:40:05,897 --> 00:40:08,858
sound like it, dress like it.

746
00:40:09,192 --> 00:40:11,236
You mind tellin' me
what the fuck happened in your situation?

747
00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:13,696
Man, kiss my ass.
This the only clean shit I had left.

748
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,300
That's saying a lot
about how you live.

749
00:40:15,365 --> 00:40:16,885
Are we getting paid to wear all black?

750
00:40:18,868 --> 00:40:22,205
Look, I ain't lookin' out for your ass
no more, man. Put this on.

751
00:40:23,414 --> 00:40:25,583
Oh, shit, there go Mr. Drummond.

752
00:40:25,667 --> 00:40:27,460
Nah, nah. That's Mr. Furley

753
00:40:27,544 --> 00:40:28,836
from Three's Company.

754
00:40:28,878 --> 00:40:30,505
Hey, that's good, Ren.

755
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,176
Y'all finished?

756
00:40:35,468 --> 00:40:38,263
This man been out there
shopping our stuff around

757
00:40:38,513 --> 00:40:40,098
trying to get money for Ruthless.

758
00:40:40,181 --> 00:40:41,724
He tryin' to get us distribution.

759
00:40:41,766 --> 00:40:43,101
He tryin' to get us on tour.

760
00:40:43,184 --> 00:40:44,185
He could probably bring some real money

761
00:40:44,227 --> 00:40:45,228
- to the table...
- Okay.

762
00:40:45,311 --> 00:40:46,312
- So let's take this shit serious.
- Okay.

763
00:40:46,396 --> 00:40:47,397
And then what, E?

764
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:51,734
All he do is take 20 off the top.
We cut 80, but that's how managers work.

765
00:40:51,776 --> 00:40:55,154
Fellas, all right. I'm sorry I'm late.
How's everybody doing?

766
00:40:55,822 --> 00:40:58,867
I'm gonna be honest with you.
We've had a lot of passes.

767
00:40:59,367 --> 00:41:02,078
Uh, people are scared of you guys.
Big time.

768
00:41:02,161 --> 00:41:04,038
They think that you're dangerous.

769
00:41:04,122 --> 00:41:06,583
Uh, I happen to think
that that's a good thing.

770
00:41:06,666 --> 00:41:08,960
These fucking guys,
they need some more convincing.

771
00:41:09,043 --> 00:41:12,714
They're so fucking timid.
So I invited them here to the show.

772
00:41:12,755 --> 00:41:16,134
So you've got to kick ass tonight.

773
00:41:16,467 --> 00:41:18,094
- Can you do that?
- Hell yeah.

774
00:41:18,177 --> 00:41:20,430
They're gonna be here.
Scare the shit out of them.

775
00:41:21,931 --> 00:41:23,600
Blow the fucking roof off, all right?

776
00:41:23,683 --> 00:41:24,726
Have a good show.

777
00:41:24,767 --> 00:41:26,144
Hey, can this motherfucker

00:41:26,227 --> 00:41:28,062
Jerry Heller bring in more pussy?

779
00:41:28,104 --> 00:41:29,544
'Cause that shit's worth 20 percent.

780
00:41:30,773 --> 00:41:36,654
Hey, man. But, for real though.
They want N.W.A, let's give 'em N.W.A.

781
00:41:36,738 --> 00:41:37,864
Hell yeah!

782
00:41:37,947 --> 00:41:39,657
- Ar'ight?
- Ar'ight.

783
00:41:39,741 --> 00:41:41,117
Let's go get this money!

784
00:41:56,132 --> 00:41:58,468
Now everybody say, "Yeah!"

785
00:41:58,593 --> 00:41:59,844
Yeah!

786
00:41:59,928 --> 00:42:01,304
Hell yeah!

787
00:42:01,387 --> 00:42:02,555
Hell yeah!

788
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:05,308
Louder! Scream!

789
00:42:08,102 --> 00:42:10,647
It was once said by a man who couldn't quit

790
00:42:10,688 --> 00:42:13,316
Dope man, please can I have another hit

791
00:42:13,399 --> 00:42:15,985
The dopeman said,
"Cluck, I don't give a shit"

792
00:42:16,069 --> 00:42:18,905
If your girl kneel down and suck my dick

793
00:42:18,988 --> 00:42:21,491
It all happened and the
guy tried to choke her

794
00:42:21,616 --> 00:42:24,202
Nigga didn't care
she ain't nothin' but a smoker

795
00:42:24,327 --> 00:42:26,788
That's the way it goes
that's the name of the game

796
00:42:26,829 --> 00:42:29,457
Young brothers gettin'
over by slangin' caine

797
00:42:29,749 --> 00:42:32,335
Gold around his neck in 14K heaven

Yeah, you want a five-oh
the dopeman's got plenty

807
00:42:56,859 --> 00:42:59,445
To be a dopeman boy, you must qualify

808
00:42:59,529 --> 00:43:01,906
Don't get high off your own supply

809
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:04,576
From a ki to a G it's all about money

810
00:43:04,659 --> 00:43:07,620
Ten piece for a champ base pipe comes free

811
00:43:07,704 --> 00:43:10,164
If people out there are not hip to the fact

Well, that's my life
That's how it's cut

00:43:48,244 --> 00:43:50,705
- Hey, dopeman

00:43:51,122 --> 00:43:53,499
Gotta make a run
It's a big money deal

What do you think?

00:44:06,262 --> 00:44:07,555
Jerry, you're my friend,

835
00:44:07,597 --> 00:44:11,601
but Compton? I don't think so.
Queens, maybe.

836
00:44:11,643 --> 00:44:15,355
Listen, if you find
the next Bon Jovi, call me, okay?

837
00:44:15,438 --> 00:44:16,718
- Good luck.
- Thanks for coming.

838
00:44:16,773 --> 00:44:17,982
- Sure thing.
- Yeah.

839
00:44:18,191 --> 00:44:20,693
Somebody say "Do that shit
Do that shit, do it"

840
00:44:20,777 --> 00:44:23,238
Do that shit, do that shit, do it

00:44:23,279 --> 00:44:26,032
Say, "Do that shit, do that shit, do it"

842
00:44:26,157 --> 00:44:28,785
Do that shit, do that shit, do it

Do that shit, do that shit, do it

845
00:44:35,917 --> 00:44:37,585
All right.

846
00:44:37,627 --> 00:44:39,387
You wrecked
these motherfuckers tonight, boy.

847
00:44:41,589 --> 00:44:45,385
The stage was shaking so much I thought
my needle's about to jump off the record!

848
00:44:47,554 --> 00:44:51,140
Yo, I was trippin' off them knowing the
words, though. That shit was crazy.

849
00:44:51,182 --> 00:44:54,435
Hey, y'all, I'm telling you,
Compton is definitely on the map, yo.

850
00:44:54,477 --> 00:44:57,105
- Damn right.
- That's for damn sure.

851
00:44:57,146 --> 00:45:00,483
Man, I figured you were gonna represent
tonight. Good shit, my nigga.

852
00:45:00,567 --> 00:45:03,444
Wuddup? Whatchu been up to?
You still out there in Vegas?

853
00:45:03,486 --> 00:45:05,154
- This is Suge.
- What's up?

854
00:45:05,238 --> 00:45:08,491
Man, I just been back and forth, man.
Doing some security bodyguard work.

855
00:45:09,367 --> 00:45:11,077
If y'all need my services, let me know.

856
00:45:12,036 --> 00:45:13,204
Security?

857
00:45:13,288 --> 00:45:15,039
I don't think we gonna need
no bodyguards, man.

858
00:45:15,123 --> 00:45:16,666
We might got that covered.

859
00:45:19,335 --> 00:45:21,337
But you never know
what you need until you need it.

860
00:45:25,174 --> 00:45:28,177
Look, I just came here to give y'all props.
I got people waiting on me.

861
00:45:29,512 --> 00:45:31,556
Excuse me.

862
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:33,433
Uh, okay. That was

863
00:45:34,392 --> 00:45:36,269
one hell of a show.

864
00:45:37,145 --> 00:45:38,605
Nice job.

865
00:45:38,688 --> 00:45:40,857
Very, very nice, gentlemen. Outstanding!

866
00:45:41,649 --> 00:45:45,069
You kicked ass, yeah.
You definitely did. You definitely did.

867
00:45:45,528 --> 00:45:49,699
Okay, this is Eazy-E and N.W.A, obviously.

868
00:45:49,908 --> 00:45:51,409
Guys, this is Bryan Turner.

869
00:45:51,993 --> 00:45:53,313
- How you doin', fellas?
- Ice Cube.

870
00:45:53,369 --> 00:45:56,331
- Pleasure.
- Bryan runs Priority Records.

871
00:45:57,165 --> 00:45:58,875
And he wants to sign you.

872
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,543
Yeah, immediately.

873
00:46:01,085 --> 00:46:03,588
Fellas, I got to say, I loved the show.
All right?

874
00:46:03,671 --> 00:46:07,383
What you did with that crowd out there,
I mean, I've never seen anything like that.

875
00:46:07,592 --> 00:46:10,762
So, I think, honestly,
if y'all wanted to, you guys

876
00:46:10,845 --> 00:46:12,847
- would fit perfectly with our label.
- Yes.

877
00:46:12,889 --> 00:46:14,265
That'll work.

878
00:46:14,349 --> 00:46:16,017
Nah, nah, nah, nah. No, it won't. Nah.

879
00:46:16,059 --> 00:46:18,853
Well, hold on, man.
I mean, Priority Records.

880
00:46:19,312 --> 00:46:21,112
I've never heard of it.
I mean, what you got?

881
00:46:21,189 --> 00:46:24,567
Like, is it Def Jam?
Like, the Beastie Boys? You know?

882
00:46:24,776 --> 00:46:27,570
Run DMC? You know what I'm saying?

883
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,073
Or is it more R&B?

884
00:46:30,156 --> 00:46:32,242
You know, Prince, Michael Jackson.

885
00:46:32,283 --> 00:46:34,118
- It's, uh, a little more...
- More that end of the spectrum.

886
00:46:34,202 --> 00:46:36,162
- More R&B as of right now, but...
- Yeah.

887
00:46:36,246 --> 00:46:38,248
Yeah, we represent nothing big,

888
00:46:38,373 --> 00:46:39,582
but mostly R&B.

889
00:46:39,666 --> 00:46:40,959
Who dat?

890
00:46:41,042 --> 00:46:42,669
It's, uh, California Raisins.

891
00:46:43,002 --> 00:46:44,295
Who?

892
00:46:44,379 --> 00:46:46,047
It's the California Raisins.

893
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:48,258
The raisins from the commercial singing

894
00:46:48,341 --> 00:46:50,101
"I Heard it Through the
Grapevine" and shit?

895
00:46:50,134 --> 00:46:51,928
Yes, Cube, the little-ass raisins.

896
00:46:52,428 --> 00:46:54,138
That would be the one.

897
00:46:54,222 --> 00:46:56,307
Hear it out.
Don't get ahead of yourselves, okay?

898
00:46:56,391 --> 00:47:00,019
I was laughing, too,
I promise, then I started cashing checks.

899
00:47:00,603 --> 00:47:04,774
So, look, I gotta tell ya, those little
fuckers, they went gold last year.

900
00:47:05,441 --> 00:47:07,735
- Gold?
- Almost platinum. Yeah.

901
00:47:08,152 --> 00:47:10,947
What do you say, fellas?
You wanna go make a record?

902
00:47:14,117 --> 00:47:15,618
I mean...

903
00:47:15,702 --> 00:47:17,453
- Yeah!
- Yeah...

904
00:47:20,707 --> 00:47:22,792
- Thank you. Appreciate it.
- Good?

905
00:47:22,876 --> 00:47:25,295
He seriously dug it. He really dug it.

906
00:47:25,336 --> 00:47:26,921
- We did it, Jerry.
- He did.

907
00:47:26,963 --> 00:47:28,163
- Thank you, man.
- You did it.

908
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:37,891
A'ight, so, look, your rhymes ain't tight,
it ain't makin' the record.

909
00:47:37,974 --> 00:47:40,727
This ain't Lonzo's shit,
this the real deal. Ar'ight?

910
00:47:41,102 --> 00:47:43,146
So your shit better be dope. Who up?

911
00:47:43,563 --> 00:47:44,772
Ren up.

912
00:47:45,106 --> 00:47:47,108
- Get 'em, Ren.
- Get that shit, Ren.

913
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:48,401
- I got this. Ready?
- Lorenzo.

914
00:47:48,484 --> 00:47:50,069
All right. Let's see.

915
00:47:50,153 --> 00:47:51,905
Hey, Yella. Play that shit.

916
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:56,034
Ruthless, plenty of that and much more

917
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:58,286
So at the party,
Ren is controllin' the floor

918
00:47:58,328 --> 00:48:01,331
That you step and do your dance routine
It ain't a dream, my man

919
00:48:01,414 --> 00:48:02,707
You're in a gangsta scene

920
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:05,084
I go to the party
I hip, I hop the spot

921
00:48:05,168 --> 00:48:07,712
I dunno what it is but the girls get hot

922
00:48:07,795 --> 00:48:09,505
Perspirin' like they're on fire and

923
00:48:09,589 --> 00:48:11,509
Their so-called boyfriends
with 'em are retirin'

924
00:48:11,633 --> 00:48:13,718
And for this reason I'm a walkin' threat

925
00:48:13,801 --> 00:48:15,053
So when I'm on stage I want...

926
00:48:15,136 --> 00:48:16,429
Quiet on tha set

927
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:21,517
Express yourself

928
00:48:21,601 --> 00:48:23,394
I'm expressin' with my full capabilities

929
00:48:23,478 --> 00:48:26,189
And now I'm livin' in
correctional facilities

930
00:48:26,272 --> 00:48:31,402
'Cause some don't agree with how I do this
I get straight meditate like a Buddhist

931
00:48:31,527 --> 00:48:33,279
Express yourself

932
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:37,659
Express yourself

933
00:48:41,037 --> 00:48:42,372
N.W.A take two

934
00:48:46,793 --> 00:48:48,336
Yeah!

935
00:48:48,378 --> 00:48:50,088
Hell yeah, Dre.

936
00:48:50,171 --> 00:48:52,048
Yeah, man!

937
00:48:52,257 --> 00:48:54,551
You feel that shit, right?
Hey, check this out.

938
00:48:54,717 --> 00:48:55,885
Fuck it up.

939
00:48:57,887 --> 00:48:59,055
Yeah.

940
00:48:59,097 --> 00:49:01,683
That's what I'm talking about, man.
But you hear the difference, right?

941
00:49:01,724 --> 00:49:03,726
Yeah, way better than the shit
I came up with.

942
00:49:03,768 --> 00:49:06,062
- I know.
- Fuck you.

943
00:49:06,896 --> 00:49:09,399
Excuse me, gentlemen.
I thought you'd like to know

944
00:49:09,732 --> 00:49:11,859
our deal with Priority Records is done.

945
00:49:12,068 --> 00:49:14,571
- Yes! That's whassup, man!
- Money!

946
00:49:14,654 --> 00:49:16,614
Contracts right here for you to sign.

947
00:49:16,781 --> 00:49:18,783
- Thank you, my good man.
- Music keep sounding like this,

948
00:49:18,867 --> 00:49:20,660
this album is gonna be incredible.

949
00:49:20,743 --> 00:49:22,370
Well, you're welcome, Jerry.

950
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:26,249
Very strong lyrics too, Cube. Very strong.

951
00:49:26,583 --> 00:49:28,084
Appreciate that, Jerry.

952
00:49:28,167 --> 00:49:29,836
So what's up with our contracts, though?

953
00:49:31,129 --> 00:49:33,449
They're getting done right now.
Lawyers are drawing 'em up.

954
00:49:33,506 --> 00:49:35,842
Jerry on top of that,
but did you just switch all the straws?

955
00:49:35,925 --> 00:49:38,845
Yo, Dre. There's something outside
you need to take care of.

956
00:49:39,262 --> 00:49:40,972
Right now. Trust me.

957
00:49:44,225 --> 00:49:46,269
Serious.

958
00:49:46,769 --> 00:49:48,479
Really?

959
00:49:49,272 --> 00:49:52,233
- We can split that.
- Cube. Right there, hush.

960
00:49:53,192 --> 00:49:56,404
- Not this time.
- You know what I got for you.

961
00:49:56,779 --> 00:49:59,866
So let me get this straight.
You gonna do this right here, right now?

962
00:50:00,074 --> 00:50:01,618
What am I supposed to do?

963
00:50:01,701 --> 00:50:03,870
We're sleeping in a twin bed
at your auntie's house.

964
00:50:03,953 --> 00:50:05,663
We have a baby, Andre.

965
00:50:05,747 --> 00:50:07,457
You expect me to wait
for what you doin' in there?

966
00:50:07,624 --> 00:50:09,292
And you in the streets fuckin' around?

967
00:50:09,375 --> 00:50:11,127
- Are you crazy?
- What?

968
00:50:11,211 --> 00:50:12,670
I'm out here bustin' my fuckin' ass

969
00:50:12,754 --> 00:50:15,006
day and fuckin' night
tryin' to create something.

970
00:50:15,089 --> 00:50:17,800
You gonna come up in here talkin' about
some fuckin' bitches? Are you crazy?

971
00:50:17,884 --> 00:50:20,386
- You don't get it.
- No, you don't get it, Lavetta.

972
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:21,512
Daddy!

973
00:50:21,596 --> 00:50:23,014
It's all right, baby.

974
00:50:23,097 --> 00:50:24,807
Chill out, man.

975
00:50:28,478 --> 00:50:30,396
Tyra, it's gonna be okay. All right.

976
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,023
- All right, baby?
- Bye, Dre.

977
00:50:32,106 --> 00:50:33,650
Daddy love you.

978
00:50:43,284 --> 00:50:45,745
- You cool?
- Fuck no, man. I'm far from cool.

979
00:50:45,828 --> 00:50:47,997
- What happened, Dre? What she say?
- What'd you do?

980
00:50:48,331 --> 00:50:50,375
Shit! Here we go again.

981
00:50:50,583 --> 00:50:52,460
Shit. One time, one time.

982
00:50:53,336 --> 00:50:56,256
We cool. We ain't even doin' shit.
We not doin' shit.

983
00:50:56,881 --> 00:50:58,800
You guys lost?

984
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:00,093
Nah.

985
00:51:00,176 --> 00:51:02,053
You niggas supposed to be somewhere?

Oh, you working?

Yeah, I bet.

989
00:51:08,601 --> 00:51:11,229
- What we do?
- We'll find out in a minute what you did.

990
00:51:11,312 --> 00:51:13,690
- What's this?
- Shut the fuck up.

991
00:51:13,773 --> 00:51:16,442
- The fuck?
- Get your ass on the ground now.

992
00:51:16,776 --> 00:51:18,778
Get on the ground!

993
00:51:19,028 --> 00:51:20,988
On the ground?
What am I supposed to do with this?

994
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:22,240
Get on the ground.

995
00:51:22,323 --> 00:51:24,158
What we do?

996
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,202
Get down! Get on the ground, now!

997
00:51:26,536 --> 00:51:28,746
Get your punk ass on the ground. Let's go.

998
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:29,873
Get the fuck down.

999
00:51:29,914 --> 00:51:31,791
Hands behind your back.
Interlock your fingers.

1000
00:51:31,916 --> 00:51:34,085
- This is fucked up.
- Interlock 'em!

1001
00:51:34,168 --> 00:51:36,629
The fuck you got us
on the ground like this for, officer?

1002
00:51:36,713 --> 00:51:39,048
For our protection.
There's seven of you and four of us.

1003
00:51:39,299 --> 00:51:40,592
So sit tight and let us do our job.

1004
00:51:40,675 --> 00:51:42,594
Hey, officer, I'm sorry.
What is going on out here?

1005
00:51:42,677 --> 00:51:44,220
Sir, can you stay right there, please?

1006
00:51:44,262 --> 00:51:46,139
We're trying to check these bangers,
make sure they're clean.

1007
00:51:46,222 --> 00:51:48,391
All right, I'm sorry,
these are not bangers, okay?

1008
00:51:48,725 --> 00:51:50,602
These, um... These are artists.

1009
00:51:51,185 --> 00:51:52,854
- Excuse me. Artists?
- Yeah.

1010
00:51:52,896 --> 00:51:54,063
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1011
00:51:54,147 --> 00:51:55,523
- What kind of artists?
- Rappers.

1012
00:51:55,565 --> 00:51:57,734
And they're working with me
in the studio right now.

1013
00:51:57,775 --> 00:52:00,612
Well, see, rap is not an art.
And I'm sorry, who are you?

1014
00:52:00,987 --> 00:52:02,071
I'm the manager.

1015
00:52:02,155 --> 00:52:04,657
Well, you're wasting your time,
Mr. Manager.

1016
00:52:04,741 --> 00:52:06,618
- You gotta be kidding me.
- You're wasting your time.

1017
00:52:06,701 --> 00:52:08,286
- Really?
- These clients of yours, these rappers...

1018
00:52:08,369 --> 00:52:10,246
- Yeah.
- They look like gang members.

1019
00:52:11,039 --> 00:52:14,334
You can't come down here and arrest people
just because of what they look like.

1020
00:52:14,417 --> 00:52:17,128
What, are you crazy?
But, that's police harassment.

1021
00:52:17,253 --> 00:52:18,588
- You said you're a manager, right?
- Yeah.

1022
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:21,216
- Not a fuckin' lawyer.
- Does that matter?

1023
00:52:21,424 --> 00:52:24,344
You cannot come down here
and harass these guys

1024
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:26,554
- because they're black! People have rights!
- Calm down.

1025
00:52:26,596 --> 00:52:28,139
Step back! Step back!

1026
00:52:28,223 --> 00:52:30,516
I'll step back, you let them up.
Get up, guys.

1027
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,268
Come on. Eric!

1028
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:34,354
- You don't tell them to get up.
- Get up.

1029
00:52:34,437 --> 00:52:35,772
- I'm stepping back.
- We will decide that.

1030
00:52:35,813 --> 00:52:38,574
You have no idea the people I know.
I'm gonna call the Mayor's office.

1031
00:52:38,608 --> 00:52:40,026
Step back.

1032
00:52:54,791 --> 00:52:56,668
Now get up.

1033
00:52:59,295 --> 00:53:01,172
Get up, now!

1034
00:53:02,799 --> 00:53:04,133
Okay. Come on, guys.

1035
00:53:04,175 --> 00:53:05,635
And you keep your people in line,
you understand?

1036
00:53:05,677 --> 00:53:07,637
And the fuck out of Torrance.

1037
00:53:08,471 --> 00:53:09,931
- Good. Come on, guys.
- You got a problem?

1038
00:53:10,014 --> 00:53:11,015
It's my jersey.

1039
00:53:11,307 --> 00:53:13,142
You ain't tough now, huh?

1040
00:53:13,351 --> 00:53:14,978
Eric, come on. Let's go.

1041
00:53:15,103 --> 00:53:16,980
- You got a problem?
- Yella.

1042
00:53:19,649 --> 00:53:21,776
- I didn't hear you.
- Let's go.

1043
00:53:21,859 --> 00:53:24,112
- Yous a fuckin' sellout.
- Shut up.

1044
00:53:25,947 --> 00:53:28,825
- Everything's fine. Okay?
- Yeah.

1045
00:53:29,117 --> 00:53:31,286
- You got something to say?
- Cube.

1046
00:53:31,327 --> 00:53:32,871
You got something to say, boy?

1047
00:53:32,954 --> 00:53:35,290
Cube. Get inside. Let's get back to work.

1048
00:53:35,331 --> 00:53:37,959
You heard what your master said.
Get inside, boy.

1049
00:53:38,376 --> 00:53:40,003
You shut the fuck up!

1050
00:53:40,587 --> 00:53:42,630
Hey. Get the fuck back inside.

1051
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,508
Get inside, Cube.

1052
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:49,095
We're gonna go back and work. Okay?

1053
00:53:49,178 --> 00:53:51,222
Leave us alone. You know, leave us alone.

1054
00:53:51,681 --> 00:53:53,016
Fuckin' rap music.

1055
00:53:53,057 --> 00:53:54,767
Fuckin' disgraceful.

1056
00:53:58,521 --> 00:54:00,273
I got something for this beat.

1057
00:54:02,025 --> 00:54:03,860
Hey, yo, Yella, cut it.

1058
00:54:05,278 --> 00:54:06,946
What is it lookin' like, Dre? It's hard?

1059
00:54:07,071 --> 00:54:08,740
Yo.

1060
00:54:13,953 --> 00:54:14,954
- Hell yeah, Cube.
- Yeah.

1061
00:54:15,038 --> 00:54:17,874
This gonna start some shit,
but this what we need. Hell yeah!

1062
00:54:18,208 --> 00:54:20,710
Fuck the police
comin' straight from the underground

1063
00:54:20,752 --> 00:54:22,921
A young nigga got it bad 'cause I'm brown

1064
00:54:23,004 --> 00:54:25,256
And not the other color so police think

1065
00:54:25,381 --> 00:54:28,051
They have the authority to kill a minority

1066
00:54:28,092 --> 00:54:29,972
Fuck that shit, 'cause I ain't the one

1067
00:54:30,053 --> 00:54:32,305
For a punk motherfucker
with a badge and a gun

1068
00:54:32,388 --> 00:54:34,807
To be beaten on and thrown in jail

1069
00:54:34,891 --> 00:54:37,352
We can go toe to toe in
the middle of a cell

1070
00:54:37,644 --> 00:54:39,854
Fucking with me 'cause I'm a teenager

1071
00:54:40,188 --> 00:54:42,357
With a little bit of gold and a pager

1072
00:54:42,398 --> 00:54:44,734
Searching my car looking for the product

1073
00:54:44,776 --> 00:54:47,278
Thinking every nigga is selling narcotics

1074
00:54:47,362 --> 00:54:49,614
Give a little gust of wind and I'm jetting

1075
00:54:49,697 --> 00:54:51,658
but leave a memory no one'll be forgetting

1076
00:54:51,741 --> 00:54:54,285
So what about the bitch
who got shot? Fuck her!

1077
00:54:54,369 --> 00:54:56,621
You think I give a damn
about a bitch? I ain't a sucker!

1078
00:54:56,704 --> 00:54:59,207
This is the autobiography of the E

1079
00:54:59,249 --> 00:55:00,833
and if you ever fuck with me

1080
00:55:00,917 --> 00:55:04,128
You'll get taken by a stupid
dope brother who will smother

1081
00:55:04,254 --> 00:55:05,547
Word to the motherfucker

1082
00:55:05,588 --> 00:55:07,715
Straight outta Compton

1083
00:55:16,766 --> 00:55:18,006
- Yo, Dre.
- Hey, Dre.

1084
00:55:20,979 --> 00:55:22,939
- They lovin' that shit.
- Hey, what's up, Cube?

1085
00:55:22,981 --> 00:55:26,109
1580 KDAY.
This is Greg Mack of the Mack Attack.

1086
00:55:26,276 --> 00:55:28,778
I gotta tell you,
you are witnessing history.

1087
00:55:29,112 --> 00:55:33,324
LA's first super group, N.W.A, with
their new album Straight Outta Compton,

1088
00:55:34,033 --> 00:55:36,619
and they're taking the nation by storm.

1089
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:41,210
Are you going
out there with them or not?

1090
00:55:41,249 --> 00:55:44,460
No. I had enough of that shit in the '70s.

1091
00:55:44,544 --> 00:55:47,797
But I'm gonna fly out there a bunch of
times, and I'm gonna check on them.

1092
00:55:47,881 --> 00:55:49,716
Can you just make sure
that everything goes smooth, please?

1093
00:55:49,799 --> 00:55:50,800
Of course.

1094
00:55:50,842 --> 00:55:53,469
I've got enough bad press
with Tipper Gore and the PMRC on my ass.

1095
00:55:53,553 --> 00:55:55,722
I know. It's a good contract.

1096
00:55:55,805 --> 00:55:58,808
- Getting ready to get outta here, guys.
- Excuse me. What's going on?

1097
00:55:58,892 --> 00:56:00,393
What do you have in that bag?

1098
00:56:00,476 --> 00:56:02,312
Oh, this right here?

1099
00:56:02,353 --> 00:56:03,605
Just a little of the shit
I was selling in Reno.

1100
00:56:03,646 --> 00:56:05,315
- Oh, fuck, put it down.
- Are you kidding me?

1101
00:56:05,356 --> 00:56:06,649
Are you fucking nuts?

1102
00:56:06,691 --> 00:56:08,651
Jesus, Eric. Are you out of your mind?

1103
00:56:08,735 --> 00:56:10,778
- What?
- You can't take that on the bus.

1104
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:12,989
How am I supposed to protect myself
when I'm out there on the road

1105
00:56:13,072 --> 00:56:16,242
riding through Texas and fucking Tennessee
and shit where they lynch niggas?

1106
00:56:16,326 --> 00:56:18,411
- You got me?
- I got you, okay?

1107
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:21,456
I'm not gonna let you take
an arsenal on tour, Eric.

1108
00:56:21,497 --> 00:56:23,458
Use your fucking head.

1109
00:56:23,499 --> 00:56:26,002
Jerry, look, just take care
of the business, a'ight?

1110
00:56:26,085 --> 00:56:27,503
And I'm gonna make sure
everything else good.

1111
00:56:27,587 --> 00:56:30,423
A'ight, look... Otis, get the bags.
Put them on the van.

1112
00:56:30,506 --> 00:56:33,968
You feel better? We're not even riding
with them no more, Jerry.

1113
00:56:34,010 --> 00:56:36,554
- Unbelievable. Jesus Christ.
- No, no, no, do not put those on the...

1114
00:56:36,679 --> 00:56:39,182
Bryan, it's fine. It's fine.
I got it under control.

1115
00:56:40,058 --> 00:56:41,601
I swear to you, okay?

1116
00:56:41,684 --> 00:56:43,686
Yeah, yeah

1117
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:46,189
Can y'all hear that? Can y'all hear that?

1118
00:56:46,231 --> 00:56:47,315
Yeah!

1119
00:56:47,357 --> 00:56:49,359
Well, clap your hands then! Come on!

1120
00:56:49,442 --> 00:56:50,526
Eazy!

1121
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:51,736
Everybody come on!

1122
00:56:51,819 --> 00:56:53,029
Eazy!

1123
00:56:53,071 --> 00:56:54,391
Who'd y'all come to see?

1124
00:56:54,447 --> 00:56:55,657
Eazy!

1125
00:56:55,698 --> 00:56:56,908
A little louder, come on!

1126
00:56:56,991 --> 00:56:59,369
- Eazy!
- Get those hands in the air!

1127
00:56:59,452 --> 00:57:01,538
A miracle of modern creation

1128
00:57:01,621 --> 00:57:03,414
Eazy-E's on the set hyped up

1129
00:57:03,498 --> 00:57:06,042
With the bass and a little
bit of what ya love

1130
00:57:06,084 --> 00:57:08,211
From a brother who's smooth like a criminal

1131
00:57:08,336 --> 00:57:09,546
I mean subliminal

1132
00:57:09,629 --> 00:57:11,839
Otherwise known as a villain

1133
00:57:11,881 --> 00:57:14,551
Because I'm ruthless,
when I spot a sucka, I kill 'em

1134
00:57:14,634 --> 00:57:16,469
But most I think know not to deal with me

1135
00:57:16,553 --> 00:57:19,180
Yo, it's obvious,
tell 'em who you came to see

1136
00:57:19,222 --> 00:57:20,515
- Eazy!
- Easy!

1137
00:57:20,557 --> 00:57:21,891
Everybody, come on.

1138
00:57:21,975 --> 00:57:23,059
Eazy!

1139
00:57:23,142 --> 00:57:24,561
A little louder
Say it!

1140
00:57:24,602 --> 00:57:27,063
- Eazy!
- Come on, say it, say it, say it

1141
00:57:27,272 --> 00:57:30,525
Gangster rap has become
incredibly popular and profitable

1142
00:57:30,567 --> 00:57:34,153
by selling lyrics about violence
to a young mainstream audience

1143
00:57:34,237 --> 00:57:36,447
that wouldn't dream
of going anywhere near a ghetto.

1144
00:57:36,739 --> 00:57:39,742
Not all music stars,
as you know, are model citizens.

1145
00:57:40,201 --> 00:57:41,870
Some have had run-ins with the law.

1146
00:57:41,953 --> 00:57:44,539
That's certainly nothing new,
but now a few musicians

1147
00:57:44,581 --> 00:57:46,583
have taken that to new heights.

1148
00:57:46,666 --> 00:57:48,001
Or to new depths.

1149
00:57:55,383 --> 00:57:56,384
Baby, yeah.

1150
00:57:59,637 --> 00:58:00,972
That is so good.

1151
00:58:01,055 --> 00:58:02,891
- Yella.
- Hmm?

1152
00:58:03,266 --> 00:58:06,227
You in there watching porn
with the door open?

1153
00:58:06,603 --> 00:58:07,604
Yeah.

1154
00:58:10,106 --> 00:58:11,983
Yo, that's what I said, man.

1155
00:58:12,734 --> 00:58:13,735
What the fuck?

1156
00:58:14,944 --> 00:58:16,446
No, it's not even like that.

1157
00:58:16,529 --> 00:58:19,782
Fuck y'all, man. I'm back here
tryin' to write. Fuck y'all, man.

1158
00:58:19,866 --> 00:58:22,368
Oh, you tryin' to write.

1159
00:58:22,452 --> 00:58:24,287
Good night, Lorenzo.

1160
00:58:25,496 --> 00:58:27,165
Fuck y'all sleep.

1161
00:58:28,958 --> 00:58:31,127
This shit is crazy.

1162
00:58:31,377 --> 00:58:33,963
Yeah, man. This shit is dope.

1163
00:58:34,422 --> 00:58:36,633
No, man. No. I gotta go.
All right?

1164
00:58:36,925 --> 00:58:38,718
Yo, you gotta let me
come fuck with y'all in Miami.

1165
00:58:38,801 --> 00:58:42,305
Okay. So now you try and partake
into some of those fat asses?

1166
00:58:42,472 --> 00:58:45,725
Come on, bro, I'm tired of these same...
Man, I need something new.

1167
00:58:45,808 --> 00:58:47,101
No, what you think Ma gonna think

1168
00:58:47,143 --> 00:58:48,645
about you comin' on tour, huh?

1169
00:58:48,728 --> 00:58:50,480
'Cause you know you got school,

1170
00:58:50,647 --> 00:58:53,191
and you know she ain't gonna
let you miss that many days, man!

1171
00:58:53,483 --> 00:58:55,523
- You did.
- Come on, man. That's my point.

1172
00:58:57,028 --> 00:58:58,655
Hey. Hold on. Hold on.

1173
00:58:59,072 --> 00:59:01,241
- So, look, how Mom doing now?
- She good.

1174
00:59:01,658 --> 00:59:04,744
But, nah, you know her,
constantly working, man. Every day, man.

1175
00:59:04,827 --> 00:59:06,871
Make sure you take care of her, a'ight?

1176
00:59:06,955 --> 00:59:08,248
Hey, look, I'll tell you what,

1177
00:59:08,331 --> 00:59:10,166
you stay your little ass outta trouble.

1178
00:59:10,375 --> 00:59:12,168
I'll call you when I'm on the way to Miami,

1179
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:13,570
see about getting you on a flight.

1180
00:59:13,628 --> 00:59:14,671
I can come out there, though?

1181
00:59:14,712 --> 00:59:16,047
- You can come out here, man.
- You promise?

1182
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:17,632
I got you. I got you, ar'ight?

1183
00:59:17,674 --> 00:59:19,801
Hey, bring the rubbers, T.

1184
00:59:19,842 --> 00:59:21,427
Get off the phone.

1185
00:59:21,511 --> 00:59:24,013
I still got the same ones
you gave me a long time ago.

1186
00:59:24,055 --> 00:59:27,183
Hey, hey. Hold on, T. Somebody at the door.

1187
00:59:27,225 --> 00:59:28,309
Here.

1188
00:59:28,476 --> 00:59:30,520
Hello? Dre?

1189
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:34,857
Hold on!

1190
00:59:36,484 --> 00:59:38,486
Yeah, nigga, I'm lookin' for my girl,
Felicia.

1191
00:59:38,570 --> 00:59:40,321
I heard she was up in one of these rooms.

1192
00:59:40,405 --> 00:59:42,240
Ain't no Felicia in here, nigga.

1193
00:59:42,991 --> 00:59:44,450
Mind if I take a look?

1194
00:59:44,868 --> 00:59:46,619
Get the fuck outta my room, man.

1195
00:59:48,454 --> 00:59:50,540
This nigga just came
to my motherfuckin' door strapped, man.

1196
00:59:50,623 --> 00:59:52,041
Where are you going?

1197
00:59:52,083 --> 00:59:53,643
I'll show that nigga strapped.

1198
00:59:53,668 --> 00:59:54,919
Hey, where Felicia at?

1199
00:59:55,003 --> 00:59:56,603
- Where Felicia?
- Where's your homegirl.

1200
00:59:56,629 --> 00:59:57,881
You Felicia?

1201
00:59:57,964 --> 00:59:59,507
Hey, Felicia. You Felicia?

1202
00:59:59,632 --> 01:00:01,301
Felicia? Her dude here.

1203
01:00:01,384 --> 01:00:04,971
All right. So none of y'all
are named Felicia now. Okay.

1204
01:00:05,054 --> 01:00:07,557
Yella! Hey, Yella!

1205
01:00:08,182 --> 01:00:09,601
Your name Felicia?

1206
01:00:10,059 --> 01:00:12,145
- You forgot my name?
- No, wait!

1207
01:00:13,187 --> 01:00:14,787
- Valerie. Your name Valerie.
- Whatever.

1208
01:00:15,064 --> 01:00:17,483
Felicia! Girl, your nigga's out there.

1209
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:18,902
She's suckin' dick, though.

1210
01:00:18,985 --> 01:00:20,486
He got guns, girl. Come on!

1211
01:00:20,570 --> 01:00:21,821
The nigga is strapped.

1212
01:00:21,905 --> 01:00:23,823
I'll show this nigga right now.
Talkin' about gettin' strapped.

1213
01:00:23,907 --> 01:00:25,783
Hey, Ren. Nigga outside talking
about gettin' strapped.

1214
01:00:25,867 --> 01:00:26,910
Watch out, man.

1215
01:00:26,951 --> 01:00:28,077
Hey!

1216
01:00:28,119 --> 01:00:29,704
Show wassup now.
Talking about gettin' strapped.

1217
01:00:29,746 --> 01:00:31,456
Hey, Cube, you got me, man.

1218
01:00:32,749 --> 01:00:34,918
Let's ride, nigga.
Time to go to work.

1219
01:00:41,466 --> 01:00:43,676
Hey. Y'all looking for Felicia?

1220
01:00:44,135 --> 01:00:45,553
She in there or what?

1221
01:00:46,804 --> 01:00:49,766
She kinda preoccupied
with some real nigga dick.

1222
01:00:49,933 --> 01:00:51,392
The fuck you say, little nigga?

1223
01:00:51,601 --> 01:00:54,520
I said, she got
a motherfuckin' dick in her mouth, nigga.

1224
01:00:54,604 --> 01:00:56,314
That ain't fun no more?

1225
01:00:56,397 --> 01:00:57,482
The fuck y'all going?

1226
01:00:57,565 --> 01:00:59,285
Nigga, she's trying to compensate.

1227
01:01:02,487 --> 01:01:04,405
Fat niggas was bullshit!

1228
01:01:05,031 --> 01:01:06,616
Punk-ass niggas, man.

1229
01:01:06,658 --> 01:01:08,076
Bitch-ass niggas.

1230
01:01:08,117 --> 01:01:09,786
Y'all wild.

1231
01:01:10,036 --> 01:01:12,747
Nigga runnin' so fast, that shit was crazy.

1232
01:01:12,789 --> 01:01:13,873
Don't let that shit bother you.

1233
01:01:13,957 --> 01:01:15,375
- Tryin' to get me killed?
- Whatever.

1234
01:01:15,458 --> 01:01:17,669
Nigga, ain't tryin'
to take no bullet for no bitch,

1235
01:01:17,794 --> 01:01:19,212
I guarantee you that.

1236
01:01:19,379 --> 01:01:20,797
Bye, Felicia.

1237
01:01:34,852 --> 01:01:37,313
Homies all standin' around just hangin '

1238
01:01:37,397 --> 01:01:39,899
Some dope-dealin', some gang-bangin'

1239
01:01:40,149 --> 01:01:41,985
We decide to roll and we deep

1240
01:01:42,235 --> 01:01:44,279
See a nigga on Dayton's, and we creep

1241
01:01:44,737 --> 01:01:46,948
Real slow, and before you know

1242
01:01:47,156 --> 01:01:49,617
I had my shotgun pointed in the window

1243
01:01:49,659 --> 01:01:51,786
He got scared and hit the gas

1244
01:01:52,078 --> 01:01:54,664
Right then I knew I had to smoke his ass

1245
01:01:54,747 --> 01:01:57,250
You're flying up
the Billboard 200 albums chart.

1246
01:01:57,333 --> 01:01:58,835
R&B and hip-hop charts too.

1247
01:01:58,877 --> 01:02:01,671
You have any idea
how many records we're selling?

1248
01:02:01,754 --> 01:02:04,841
Ruthless has arrived, Eric.
We're fucking huge.

1249
01:02:04,883 --> 01:02:08,344
That is dope, Jerry. That's dope.

1250
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:11,347
The combined law enforcement
associations of Texas today

1251
01:02:11,389 --> 01:02:13,433
called for a halt to sales of the album.

1252
01:02:13,516 --> 01:02:17,186
I believe that the rap music
promotes violence against authority

1253
01:02:17,228 --> 01:02:19,689
and, consequently, violence
against law enforcement.

1254
01:02:20,023 --> 01:02:21,608
15 on that.

1255
01:02:21,858 --> 01:02:23,443
Man, fuck, man!

1256
01:02:23,651 --> 01:02:25,411
Hey. Come on, man. Put that shit up.

1257
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:29,407
Excuse me. Gentlemen, I'm sorry.

1258
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:31,534
I don't mean to be the bearer of bad news.

1259
01:02:31,659 --> 01:02:32,869
What you got?

1260
01:02:33,995 --> 01:02:35,205
Oh, shit.

1261
01:02:35,330 --> 01:02:36,539
What's that?

1262
01:02:37,498 --> 01:02:39,125
Motherfuckin' FBI.

1263
01:02:41,294 --> 01:02:43,004
What the fuck?
I'm supposed to not care about this?

1264
01:02:43,087 --> 01:02:45,632
Wait, the FBI? They comin' after us, too?

1265
01:02:45,715 --> 01:02:46,716
Kind of.

1266
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:48,301
I mean, what the letter say, Jerry?

1267
01:02:48,384 --> 01:02:50,303
Basically...

1268
01:02:50,845 --> 01:02:53,056
"A song recorded by the rap group N.W.A

1269
01:02:53,097 --> 01:02:55,558
"on their album Straight Out Of Compton

1270
01:02:55,725 --> 01:02:58,061
"encourages violence
against law enforcement.

1271
01:02:58,144 --> 01:03:00,271
"Advocating violence and assault is wrong,

1272
01:03:00,438 --> 01:03:04,317
"and we in the law enforcement community
take exception to such action."

1273
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,568
- Fuck that.
- Fuck that.

1274
01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:08,321
Fuck the law enforcement community.
We got freedom of speech, man.

1275
01:03:08,488 --> 01:03:10,448
- What the fuck can they do to us?
- Right.

1276
01:03:10,490 --> 01:03:11,783
You wanna provoke 'em and find out?

1277
01:03:11,908 --> 01:03:13,451
Because this is a warning, Cube.

1278
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:16,704
And it's about Fuck Tha Police,
in particular, so...

1279
01:03:17,872 --> 01:03:21,251
I think maybe we should not
play that song right now.

1280
01:03:21,376 --> 01:03:24,045
Not play what? Fuck that, Jerry.
That's what the song is about.

1281
01:03:24,170 --> 01:03:25,838
Relax, relax.
We're not giving in to anything.

1282
01:03:25,922 --> 01:03:26,965
No. No.

1283
01:03:27,048 --> 01:03:29,300
I just say we retire it for now, okay?

1284
01:03:29,425 --> 01:03:31,302
It is a reasonably worded threat.

1285
01:03:32,387 --> 01:03:35,598
This isn't street bullshit.
This isn't the Crips and Bloods and crap.

1286
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:36,891
This is the federal government.

1287
01:03:36,933 --> 01:03:39,602
These guys can come after us
a million different ways.

1288
01:03:39,686 --> 01:03:41,771
I don't even want to think about it.
Why provoke them?

1289
01:03:41,813 --> 01:03:42,939
The fuck does that mean?

1290
01:03:43,022 --> 01:03:44,941
If it was the LAPD,
maybe I'd be a little worried,

1291
01:03:44,983 --> 01:03:46,609
but we can't let them censor us, Jerry.

1292
01:03:46,651 --> 01:03:48,653
- I'm not advocating for censorship, Cube.
- Wait. Wait.

1293
01:03:48,736 --> 01:03:52,782
Maybe none of us should be worried.
Maybe we should be happy.

1294
01:03:53,741 --> 01:03:55,301
- What you mean, E?
- Dunno about happy.

1295
01:03:55,368 --> 01:03:57,203
'Cause you see,
this right here is a gift.

1296
01:03:57,328 --> 01:03:58,621
It's the FBI, E. Whatchu talking about?

1297
01:03:58,705 --> 01:04:03,126
This is free publicity for N.W.A.

1298
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:05,712
We take this to the press and we show them

1299
01:04:06,004 --> 01:04:09,591
what type of intimidation,
discrimination, and harassment

1300
01:04:09,632 --> 01:04:11,175
that we dealing with from our government.

1301
01:04:11,259 --> 01:04:12,802
- I like that shit.
- I'm with that.

1302
01:04:12,927 --> 01:04:15,127
- That's a different thing.
- My nigga, I feel you.

1303
01:04:15,179 --> 01:04:17,899
- If that's what you wanna do, then we can...
- That's what I wanna do.

1304
01:04:17,974 --> 01:04:20,935
That's what we wanna do, Jerry. That's it.

1305
01:04:22,145 --> 01:04:23,813
That's what we wanna do.

1306
01:04:23,855 --> 01:04:24,981
Okay.

1307
01:04:25,106 --> 01:04:27,150
- Yeah?
- You good?

1308
01:04:27,191 --> 01:04:28,484
I mean...

1309
01:04:28,568 --> 01:04:31,070
Hate to be the bearer of bad news...

1310
01:04:31,154 --> 01:04:33,239
- But 20!
- 20, man!

1311
01:04:33,323 --> 01:04:35,200
Wait a minute, that ain't 20.

1312
01:04:35,283 --> 01:04:37,660
- Hey, hey, hey. Shhh.
- What's up?

1313
01:04:37,744 --> 01:04:39,829
Let's not get thrown out
of another fuckin' hotel.

1314
01:04:39,913 --> 01:04:41,164
Goodnight, Jerry.

1315
01:04:41,497 --> 01:04:43,333
Compton's crap!

1316
01:04:43,708 --> 01:04:45,335
Go back to Compton!

1317
01:04:45,376 --> 01:04:47,170
Ain't that some shit.

1318
01:04:47,253 --> 01:04:49,505
Speak a little truth
and people lose their minds.

1319
01:04:50,798 --> 01:04:52,258
This is not music!

1320
01:04:52,342 --> 01:04:55,678
Shit, the truth is,
they can do whatever they want with 'em.

1321
01:04:57,055 --> 01:04:58,348
They bought them motherfuckers.

1322
01:04:59,849 --> 01:05:01,559
I don't drink brass monkey,

1323
01:05:01,643 --> 01:05:05,188
Like to be funky
Nickname Eazy-E yo eight ball junkie

1324
01:05:05,688 --> 01:05:07,857
Bass drum kicking to show my shit

1325
01:05:07,941 --> 01:05:10,652
Rapping holding my dick, boy, I don't quit

1326
01:05:10,693 --> 01:05:13,196
Crowd-rocking motherfucker
from around the way

1327
01:05:13,279 --> 01:05:16,032
I got a six-shooter, yo, mean hombre

1328
01:05:16,282 --> 01:05:18,618
Rolling through the hood to find the boys

1329
01:05:18,701 --> 01:05:21,329
To kick dust and cuss crank up some noise

1330
01:05:21,371 --> 01:05:23,873
Police on my balls
I had to pause

1331
01:05:23,957 --> 01:05:26,876
40 ounce in my lap,
and it's freezing my balls

1332
01:05:26,918 --> 01:05:30,171
For the sake of our children,
I implore each of you

1333
01:05:30,213 --> 01:05:34,384
to be unyielding and inflexible
in your opposition to drugs.

1334
01:05:35,218 --> 01:05:39,055
'Cause another one called me
and told me she's pregnant by you too.

1335
01:05:39,097 --> 01:05:40,139
You just got to slow down.

1336
01:05:40,223 --> 01:05:42,725
You can't fuck every broad on the planet.

1337
01:05:42,809 --> 01:05:43,935
So now, pussy a problem?

1338
01:05:44,018 --> 01:05:46,896
Listen, it's gonna be a problem
if you got 4,000 kids.

1339
01:05:47,021 --> 01:05:48,189
- Right?
- Yeah.

1340
01:05:48,231 --> 01:05:49,440
You make some money,

1341
01:05:49,524 --> 01:05:50,650
you got all these problems.

1342
01:05:50,733 --> 01:05:52,777
You're gonna have to take care of 'em.
It's fine.

1343
01:05:53,403 --> 01:05:55,071
I'll help you take care of 'em.

1344
01:05:55,196 --> 01:05:57,991
- Hey, Cube.
- Sorry to interrupt y'all lobster brunch.

1345
01:05:58,867 --> 01:06:01,411
But what's up, E? Where the contracts at,
man? You forgot about me?

1346
01:06:01,494 --> 01:06:03,014
Didn't I tell you to... You know what?

1347
01:06:03,413 --> 01:06:04,747
Jerry, you want to deal with this?

1348
01:06:04,789 --> 01:06:06,291
I'm not talking to Jerry,
I'm talking to you.

1349
01:06:06,374 --> 01:06:07,584
That's Jerry's job.

1350
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:10,270
It's my department.
You're absolutely right to ask, Cube.

1351
01:06:10,295 --> 01:06:12,964
The contracts are being
finalized as we speak.

1352
01:06:13,506 --> 01:06:16,175
The thing is,
with these attorneys, they'll take forever.

1353
01:06:16,342 --> 01:06:19,762
Pouring over it, they'll bleed us dry.
But, they're gonna get done.

1354
01:06:19,804 --> 01:06:22,432
I wish I got paid by the hour
the way they do. You know?

1355
01:06:22,807 --> 01:06:24,392
Me, too.

1356
01:06:24,517 --> 01:06:28,813
I just want to know what's goin' on since I
did write a lot of lyrics on this record.

1357
01:06:30,315 --> 01:06:32,483
Everybody knows
how important you are, Cube.

1358
01:06:33,318 --> 01:06:34,694
They do?

1359
01:06:36,154 --> 01:06:37,655
That's what's goin' on.

1360
01:06:38,031 --> 01:06:39,991
We just need some time, that's all.

1361
01:06:43,536 --> 01:06:45,747
Everything probably all right.

1362
01:06:46,623 --> 01:06:48,124
I must be trippin'.

1363
01:06:54,297 --> 01:06:56,049
Shit tastes pretty good.

1364
01:06:57,091 --> 01:06:58,509
Someday, right?

1365
01:07:00,970 --> 01:07:02,388
Y'all enjoy your meal.

1366
01:07:02,472 --> 01:07:03,473
Okay.

1367
01:07:09,646 --> 01:07:12,815
I'm telling you, that guy wants
to be you very frickin' badly.

1368
01:07:12,857 --> 01:07:14,859
As if I ain't got enough fucking problems.

1369
01:07:14,943 --> 01:07:16,778
Excuse me. Can I get a refill?

1370
01:07:16,819 --> 01:07:18,821
At some point,
you just gotta trust somebody.

1371
01:07:19,989 --> 01:07:21,241
You know?

1372
01:07:22,659 --> 01:07:24,619
You gotta trust somebody.

1373
01:07:26,829 --> 01:07:28,749
Nah, I just think
you overreacting, man.

1374
01:07:28,998 --> 01:07:32,085
Eazy one of us, Cube.
What you thinkin' don't even make sense.

1375
01:07:32,168 --> 01:07:33,336
No, what don't make sense is

1376
01:07:33,419 --> 01:07:37,590
Eazy and Jerry eating steak and lobster
and we eating Fatburger.

1377
01:07:37,674 --> 01:07:38,925
Shit don't make no sense.

1378
01:07:39,008 --> 01:07:43,096
Look, I hear you,
but I think we need to ride this wave.

1379
01:07:43,513 --> 01:07:44,973
For real.

1380
01:07:45,014 --> 01:07:47,214
Don't be jumping to conclusions
until you know for sure.

1381
01:07:47,267 --> 01:07:49,477
You know?

1382
01:07:55,275 --> 01:07:57,110
It's my moms, man.

1383
01:08:16,170 --> 01:08:17,672
Yo, Dre,

1384
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:19,424
what's going on?

1385
01:08:22,886 --> 01:08:24,804
Moms just called, man.

1386
01:08:28,683 --> 01:08:30,143
It's Tyree.

1387
01:08:31,185 --> 01:08:32,645
He's dead.

1388
01:08:33,229 --> 01:08:34,898
What? No.

1389
01:08:36,232 --> 01:08:39,319
He got into a fight,
some motherfucker broke his neck.

1390
01:08:42,697 --> 01:08:44,741
It's my little brother, man.

1391
01:08:48,912 --> 01:08:50,705
It's my little baby bro.

1392
01:09:09,974 --> 01:09:11,935
I never told y'all this.

1393
01:09:12,852 --> 01:09:15,605
But when I was 12, my sister got killed.

1394
01:09:16,773 --> 01:09:19,984
Her own husband killed her,
then killed himself.

1395
01:09:31,287 --> 01:09:33,665
This dope gang took my cousin too.

1396
01:09:37,794 --> 01:09:39,879
Shot him in the trunk of a car.

1397
01:09:42,632 --> 01:09:44,300
Fucking Compton, man.

1398
01:09:44,801 --> 01:09:46,636
Come on, man, like...

1399
01:09:48,012 --> 01:09:49,514
It's my fault, man.

1400
01:09:49,973 --> 01:09:51,474
Don't talk like that.

1401
01:09:51,516 --> 01:09:53,434
This never would've happened
if I had him out here, man.

1402
01:09:53,476 --> 01:09:54,561
Come on, Dre.

1403
01:09:54,644 --> 01:09:56,187
It's my fuckin' fault.

1404
01:09:56,312 --> 01:09:58,147
It could've happened in another way.

1405
01:09:59,524 --> 01:10:01,651
- You can't blame yourself for that, Dre.
- No.

1406
01:10:02,026 --> 01:10:04,696
Tyree gonna always be with you.
No matter what.

1407
01:10:05,238 --> 01:10:07,574
- That's right.
- Yeah, for real, man.

1408
01:10:07,782 --> 01:10:09,659
And we always gonna be with you.

1409
01:10:09,826 --> 01:10:11,327
Hell yeah.

1410
01:10:11,369 --> 01:10:12,829
We always gonna be brothers.

1411
01:10:12,954 --> 01:10:15,373
Fuck.

1412
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:19,127
We here, a'ight.

1413
01:10:19,252 --> 01:10:20,670
I'm sorry, man.

1414
01:10:20,712 --> 01:10:22,005
You good, Dre.

1415
01:10:26,885 --> 01:10:29,178
This is not on you, Andre.

1416
01:10:30,847 --> 01:10:34,183
If I had just brought him on tour with me.
Like he wanted.

1417
01:10:34,225 --> 01:10:36,185
Stop this nonsense now. Stop it.

1418
01:10:37,353 --> 01:10:39,606
Your brother looked up to you,

1419
01:10:39,689 --> 01:10:42,400
and you took great care of him,
we both did.

1420
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:47,238
It's time to let someone else
take care of him now.

1421
01:11:00,335 --> 01:11:02,003
I'm proud of you.

1422
01:11:27,403 --> 01:11:31,449
No person shall disturb the peace
by participating or abetting

1423
01:11:31,532 --> 01:11:34,994
in any rude, indecent, drunken,

1424
01:11:35,078 --> 01:11:37,038
riotous or violent conduct.

1425
01:11:37,372 --> 01:11:39,666
Or the use of any vulgar, obscene

1426
01:11:39,749 --> 01:11:41,960
or abusive language in a public place.

1427
01:11:42,418 --> 01:11:44,963
Note also, the performance of the song

1428
01:11:45,046 --> 01:11:49,008
"F the Police", will not be permitted.

1429
01:11:49,592 --> 01:11:52,345
Refusal to abide
by all the Detroit City Ordinances

1430
01:11:52,971 --> 01:11:55,974
will result in immediate
arrest and forfeiture.

1431
01:11:57,767 --> 01:12:00,353
Are we finished here? We got a show to do.

1432
01:12:04,816 --> 01:12:06,442
Just watch yourself.

1433
01:12:09,654 --> 01:12:11,281
Eat a dick.

1434
01:12:11,948 --> 01:12:13,825
It's "Fuck tha Police."

1435
01:12:14,075 --> 01:12:15,493
Straight outta Compton

1436
01:12:15,577 --> 01:12:17,453
is a brother that'll smother your mother

1437
01:12:17,537 --> 01:12:19,330
and make your sister think I love her

1438
01:12:19,539 --> 01:12:21,833
Dangerous motherfucker raising hell

1439
01:12:21,916 --> 01:12:23,877
and if I ever get caught I make bail

1440
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:26,129
So what about the bitch
who got shot? Fuck her!

1441
01:12:26,212 --> 01:12:28,548
You think I give a damn
about a bitch? I ain't a sucker!

1442
01:12:28,631 --> 01:12:31,426
This is an autobiography of the E

1443
01:12:31,467 --> 01:12:32,844
And if you ever fuck with me

1444
01:12:32,927 --> 01:12:34,137
You'll get taken

1445
01:12:34,178 --> 01:12:36,097
by a stupid dope brother who will smother

1446
01:12:36,222 --> 01:12:39,100
Word to the motherfucker
Straight outta Compton

1447
01:12:42,937 --> 01:12:45,523
Eazy! Eazy!

1448
01:12:54,365 --> 01:12:56,784
Damn, that shit was dope!

1449
01:13:11,049 --> 01:13:12,467
What's up?

1450
01:13:12,592 --> 01:13:14,010
Let's do this shit.

1451
01:13:14,093 --> 01:13:15,595
- What's up?
- Let's do this shit.

1452
01:13:16,596 --> 01:13:18,348
- Wassup? Let's go.
- What's up?

1453
01:13:22,477 --> 01:13:24,687
Hey, hold up, hold up.

1454
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:27,273
Y'all know
what the motherfuckin' police

1455
01:13:27,357 --> 01:13:28,650
tried to tell us backstage?

1456
01:13:28,816 --> 01:13:30,151
What?

1457
01:13:30,193 --> 01:13:33,905
They tried to tell us
what the fuck we can't play.

1458
01:13:36,658 --> 01:13:38,743
Motherfuckers tried to tell us

1459
01:13:39,536 --> 01:13:41,704
what the fuck we can't say.

1460
01:13:45,833 --> 01:13:47,377
This N.W.A.

1461
01:13:49,212 --> 01:13:51,339
We do what the fuck we wanna do!

1462
01:13:51,839 --> 01:13:54,300
We say what the fuck we wanna say!

1463
01:13:55,927 --> 01:13:57,554
So, everybody,

1464
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:00,056
put the middle fingers high in the sky.

1465
01:14:02,767 --> 01:14:05,395
And to the punk-ass cop backstage...

1466
01:14:20,076 --> 01:14:21,244
Yo, Dre.

1467
01:14:21,369 --> 01:14:23,746
- What up?
- I got something to say.

1468
01:14:26,249 --> 01:14:27,292
Fuck the police

1469
01:14:27,375 --> 01:14:29,127
Comin' straight from the underground

1470
01:14:29,210 --> 01:14:31,254
A young nigga got it bad 'cause I'm brown

1471
01:14:31,296 --> 01:14:33,256
And not the other color so police think

1472
01:14:33,506 --> 01:14:36,009
they have the authority to kill a minority

1473
01:14:36,092 --> 01:14:38,052
Fuck that shit 'cause I ain't the one

1474
01:14:38,261 --> 01:14:40,597
For a punk motherfucker
with a badge and a gun

1475
01:14:40,638 --> 01:14:43,099
to be beaten on and thrown in jail

1476
01:14:43,224 --> 01:14:45,727
We can go toe to toe in
the middle of a cell

1477
01:14:45,768 --> 01:14:48,271
Fucking with me 'cause I'm a teenager

1478
01:14:48,354 --> 01:14:50,565
With a little bit of gold and a pager

1479
01:14:50,607 --> 01:14:53,067
Searching my car looking for the product

1480
01:14:53,109 --> 01:14:55,570
Thinking every nigga is selling narcotics

1481
01:14:55,653 --> 01:14:57,864
You'd rather see me in the pen

1482
01:14:57,947 --> 01:15:00,575
Than me and Lorenzo rolling in a Benz-o

1483
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:02,535
Beat a police out of shape

1484
01:15:02,619 --> 01:15:03,786
Then when I'm finished

1485
01:15:03,828 --> 01:15:04,996
Bring the yellow tape

1486
01:15:05,246 --> 01:15:07,624
To tape off the scene of the slaughter

1487
01:15:07,665 --> 01:15:10,376
Still getting swoll off bread and water

1488
01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:12,295
I don't know if they fags or what

1489
01:15:12,503 --> 01:15:14,631
Search a nigga down and grabbing his nuts

1490
01:15:14,714 --> 01:15:17,592
And on the other hand,
without a gun they can't get none

1491
01:15:17,634 --> 01:15:19,969
But don't let it be a black and a white one

1492
01:15:20,053 --> 01:15:22,305
'Cause they'll slam ya
down to the street top

1493
01:15:22,388 --> 01:15:24,974
Black police showing out for the white cop

1494
01:15:25,141 --> 01:15:26,893
Ice Cube will swarm

1495
01:15:26,976 --> 01:15:29,479
On any motherfucker in a blue uniform

1496
01:15:29,771 --> 01:15:31,898
Just 'cause I'm from the CPT

1497
01:15:32,023 --> 01:15:34,651
Punk police are afraid of me, huh

1498
01:15:34,692 --> 01:15:36,527
A young nigga on the warpath

1499
01:15:36,611 --> 01:15:39,447
And when I'm finished,
it's gonna be a bloodbath

1500
01:15:39,489 --> 01:15:41,908
Of cops, dyin' in LA

1501
01:15:41,991 --> 01:15:44,327
Yo, Dre, I got something to say

1502
01:15:44,369 --> 01:15:45,662
Fuck tha police!

1503
01:15:45,745 --> 01:15:47,705
Fuck, fuck, fuck tha police!

1504
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:50,542
Fuck tha police!

1505
01:15:50,625 --> 01:15:51,793
Fuck, fuck...

1506
01:15:51,834 --> 01:15:53,753
Fuck tha police!

1507
01:15:54,879 --> 01:15:55,880
Fuck!

1508
01:15:56,839 --> 01:15:58,091
Come on, nigga.

1509
01:15:58,174 --> 01:16:00,134
Hell no! They shootin'! Let's go!

1510
01:16:02,345 --> 01:16:04,097
Go, go! All units, move in.

1511
01:16:08,685 --> 01:16:09,852
Move!

1512
01:16:09,894 --> 01:16:11,145
Move!

1513
01:16:11,229 --> 01:16:12,855
Go, go, go, go, go! Come on, man!

1514
01:16:17,235 --> 01:16:19,070
Come on, hurry up! Hurry up!

1515
01:16:19,153 --> 01:16:20,753
- Hold up, hold up.
- Let's go, let's go.

1516
01:16:20,822 --> 01:16:22,532
- Fuck them!
- Come on!

1517
01:16:22,615 --> 01:16:23,783
Fuck!

1518
01:16:24,033 --> 01:16:25,201
Shit, shit, shit, shit!

1519
01:16:25,451 --> 01:16:28,121
- Fuck this!
- What we gonna do?

1520
01:16:28,621 --> 01:16:29,873
Get off me!

1521
01:16:29,914 --> 01:16:31,624
Get the fuck off me!

1522
01:16:35,253 --> 01:16:37,005
Man, get off me, man!

1523
01:16:37,505 --> 01:16:38,882
Away from the ledge.

1524
01:16:40,758 --> 01:16:42,969
Backup!
We need backup in the loading area!

1525
01:16:43,177 --> 01:16:44,387
Now!

1526
01:16:45,972 --> 01:16:47,390
Man!

1527
01:16:48,975 --> 01:16:51,352
Come on. Get the fuck off of me, man!

1528
01:16:51,561 --> 01:16:52,896
Fuck y'all.

1529
01:16:54,522 --> 01:16:57,567
This is completely fucking illegal!
You realize that?

1530
01:16:58,401 --> 01:17:00,737
Let us go! Let me go! Come on, man.

1531
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:03,197
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
- Come on.

1532
01:17:03,281 --> 01:17:04,616
Fuck you! Fuck you!

1533
01:17:04,699 --> 01:17:06,910
Get in there!
You gotta get in there.

1534
01:17:07,118 --> 01:17:09,537
Fuck tha police! Fuck tha police!

1535
01:17:09,621 --> 01:17:11,915
Fuck tha police! Fuck tha police!

1536
01:17:11,956 --> 01:17:15,752
Fuck your mama,
fuck your daddy, fuck your grandma!

1537
01:17:17,754 --> 01:17:19,255
Fucking...

1538
01:17:20,256 --> 01:17:22,425
These motherfuckers.

1539
01:17:26,221 --> 01:17:28,264
Fuck y'all!

1540
01:17:44,155 --> 01:17:45,990
How do you explain
inciting a riot in Detroit?

1541
01:17:46,157 --> 01:17:47,450
What do you have to say about that?

1542
01:17:47,575 --> 01:17:50,286
I have to say that we
didn't incite that shit.

1543
01:17:50,787 --> 01:17:54,040
Right. Like, y'all just got a snapshot
of how Americans really feel.

1544
01:17:54,123 --> 01:17:56,334
We gave the people a voice.

1545
01:17:56,876 --> 01:17:58,962
We gave the people truth.

1546
01:17:59,462 --> 01:18:03,800
Yeah, but your songs, they glamorize
the lifestyle of gangs, guns, drugs.

1547
01:18:03,967 --> 01:18:06,177
Our art is a reflection of our reality.

1548
01:18:06,928 --> 01:18:08,638
What you see
when you go outside your door?

1549
01:18:09,055 --> 01:18:10,098
I know what I see.

1550
01:18:10,181 --> 01:18:11,266
And it ain't glamorous.

1551
01:18:11,432 --> 01:18:14,310
We get AKs from Russia
and cocaine from Columbia.

1552
01:18:14,852 --> 01:18:17,230
And ain't none of us got a passport, so...

1553
01:18:18,523 --> 01:18:20,024
...might wanna check the source.

1554
01:18:20,483 --> 01:18:21,484
Next question.

1555
01:18:21,526 --> 01:18:23,886
Will you be more careful
about what you say, how you say it?

1556
01:18:23,987 --> 01:18:25,572
- No!
- Probably not. Nah.

1557
01:18:26,197 --> 01:18:28,783
Freedom of speech
includes rap music, right?

1558
01:18:28,825 --> 01:18:32,495
Well, we exercising our first amendment
as far as I'm concerned.

1559
01:18:32,579 --> 01:18:34,497
And the government wrote that.

1560
01:18:35,456 --> 01:18:37,417
So, Cube, what's a guy from Compton

1561
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:39,752
do when he starts making
real money like this?

1562
01:18:46,092 --> 01:18:47,343
Cube?

1563
01:18:48,344 --> 01:18:50,346
Buy Raider gear.

1564
01:18:50,763 --> 01:18:52,807
And curl activator.

1565
01:18:54,017 --> 01:18:55,393
Next question.

1566
01:19:11,075 --> 01:19:12,535
Good to see you, Cube.

1567
01:19:12,911 --> 01:19:14,704
I can barely see you, Jerry.

1568
01:19:15,288 --> 01:19:17,081
What's with all the Godfather shit?

1569
01:19:19,042 --> 01:19:20,293
Okay.

1570
01:19:20,710 --> 01:19:23,463
I know that you've been very eager to sign

1571
01:19:23,546 --> 01:19:26,549
a contract with Eric's company,
Ruthless Records.

1572
01:19:26,591 --> 01:19:28,551
Eric's company? Ain't it your company, too?

1573
01:19:28,801 --> 01:19:32,472
That's incorrect.
It's not my company. I work for you.

1574
01:19:32,597 --> 01:19:34,015
You work for me?

1575
01:19:34,224 --> 01:19:35,975
I've made that clear from the beginning.

1576
01:19:36,226 --> 01:19:38,061
All right, cool.
So, I could take this to a lawyer

1577
01:19:38,144 --> 01:19:39,187
or somebody, right?

1578
01:19:39,229 --> 01:19:41,564
Cube, those guys are paid to make trouble.

1579
01:19:41,731 --> 01:19:44,400
They're gonna create problems
where no problems exist.

1580
01:19:44,609 --> 01:19:47,320
Jerry, you know I don't know
what none of this legal shit mean.

1581
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:49,280
All right? None of us do.

1582
01:19:49,656 --> 01:19:51,491
So we're gonna need a lawyer
before we sign anything.

1583
01:19:51,574 --> 01:19:53,368
Everybody else has already signed.

1584
01:19:55,245 --> 01:19:57,038
I thought you knew this.

1585
01:19:57,372 --> 01:19:58,998
You're the only one who hasn't.

1586
01:20:04,587 --> 01:20:06,339
There's also this.

1587
01:20:07,215 --> 01:20:08,758
$75,000.

1588
01:20:13,137 --> 01:20:14,264
Shit!

1589
01:20:14,389 --> 01:20:15,723
Sign the contract

1590
01:20:15,807 --> 01:20:17,559
and all this money is yours.

1591
01:20:17,725 --> 01:20:20,186
That's my money anyway, Jerry.
I earned that money.

1592
01:20:20,603 --> 01:20:22,772
And I wrote a lot of hit songs.

1593
01:20:22,897 --> 01:20:24,774
We've been performing
on this tour for months.

1594
01:20:24,941 --> 01:20:26,776
Sellin' out shows, sellin' records.

1595
01:20:27,235 --> 01:20:29,070
I know there's plenty of money.

1596
01:20:29,279 --> 01:20:31,447
Really? Jesus Christ.

1597
01:20:32,198 --> 01:20:33,283
Give me my money, Jerry.

1598
01:20:33,324 --> 01:20:34,826
How the hell do you think this works?

1599
01:20:35,535 --> 01:20:38,621
How the hell do you think
all of this gets paid for?

1600
01:20:39,289 --> 01:20:41,791
The hotel rooms, the tour buses,

1601
01:20:42,041 --> 01:20:45,169
security, the parties, all this shit.

1602
01:20:45,253 --> 01:20:47,463
How do you think it gets paid for?
You think it's free?

1603
01:20:47,505 --> 01:20:49,132
Why are you doing this now?

1604
01:20:49,465 --> 01:20:52,302
If we were so good, why didn't you give us
contracts in the beginning?

1605
01:20:52,468 --> 01:20:54,470
Because nothing is a sure thing, Cube.

1606
01:20:55,805 --> 01:20:58,808
Even a great talent can crash and burn.

1607
01:21:01,769 --> 01:21:04,063
Too much ego, too much excess,

1608
01:21:04,606 --> 01:21:06,149
too many expectations.

1609
01:21:08,443 --> 01:21:11,446
It tends to ruin things.
You ought to keep that in mind.

1610
01:21:20,121 --> 01:21:21,998
This is Eric's company, right?

1611
01:21:26,294 --> 01:21:27,545
Bye, Jerry.

1612
01:21:28,087 --> 01:21:29,589
I'm out.

1613
01:21:55,323 --> 01:21:56,783
What up, big Suge?

1614
01:21:57,367 --> 01:21:58,451
Here you go.

1615
01:21:58,535 --> 01:21:59,702
Thank you, sir.

1616
01:22:00,870 --> 01:22:02,997
Hey, what up with D.O.C. and Suge?

1617
01:22:03,498 --> 01:22:06,584
I guess that dude
is gonna be managing him now.

1618
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,379
One day
you Bobby Brown's bodyguard,

1619
01:22:09,462 --> 01:22:11,339
and the next day, you reppin' talent.

1620
01:22:11,673 --> 01:22:12,924
Come on, man.

1621
01:22:13,049 --> 01:22:14,849
I guess everybody
wanna get into the act, huh?

1622
01:22:14,884 --> 01:22:16,052
I guess so.

1623
01:22:16,177 --> 01:22:17,554
All right, man.

1624
01:22:21,599 --> 01:22:23,268
I know, right?

1625
01:22:23,893 --> 01:22:26,271
- How you doin'? You good?
- Here you go.

1626
01:22:26,354 --> 01:22:28,356
I'm helping you out all I can.
You all right?

1627
01:22:28,815 --> 01:22:30,108
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I'm good.

1628
01:22:30,191 --> 01:22:32,277
- What's going on?
- Just happy to be home.

1629
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:33,653
You hungry?

1630
01:22:34,153 --> 01:22:35,238
Yeah?

1631
01:22:35,321 --> 01:22:36,906
I'll be there in a minute. All right?

1632
01:22:37,282 --> 01:22:38,533
Thanks, man.

1633
01:22:40,118 --> 01:22:41,578
- Thanks for everything, bruh.
- You bet!

1634
01:22:41,661 --> 01:22:43,413
So, Cube.

1635
01:22:43,913 --> 01:22:45,248
We gonna keep
this momentum going or what?

1636
01:22:45,331 --> 01:22:46,958
Nah, man. Not like this.

1637
01:22:47,917 --> 01:22:50,587
I'd rather be broke than to get fucked.

1638
01:22:50,628 --> 01:22:52,505
I told you not to sign that shit, Dre.

1639
01:22:52,589 --> 01:22:55,174
Nigga, I got bills to pay.
And you know that.

1640
01:22:55,675 --> 01:22:58,678
And I gotta put some money
in my momma's hand after Tyree passed, man.

1641
01:22:59,053 --> 01:23:00,597
- I feel you.
- Right.

1642
01:23:00,847 --> 01:23:02,599
We gotta do what we gotta do.

1643
01:23:03,474 --> 01:23:05,476
They're gonna take care of you.
You their bread and butter.

1644
01:23:05,602 --> 01:23:07,312
Cube, we Ruthless.

1645
01:23:07,770 --> 01:23:10,773
We N.W.A. They Ruthless.

1646
01:23:14,736 --> 01:23:16,613
Cube, you comin'?

1647
01:23:18,197 --> 01:23:19,908
I'm about to get out of here.

1648
01:23:21,242 --> 01:23:22,702
Take care of yourself, Dre.

1649
01:23:22,785 --> 01:23:23,953
Peace.

1650
01:23:35,965 --> 01:23:38,468
- Mom.
- I missed you.

1651
01:23:42,222 --> 01:23:43,806
- How you doing?
- I'm good.

1652
01:23:43,848 --> 01:23:45,183
- Good.
- Come on. Let's get home.

1653
01:23:45,266 --> 01:23:46,643
All right.

1654
01:23:47,393 --> 01:23:48,478
So you're leaving the group?

1655
01:23:48,519 --> 01:23:50,772
Yeah, I'm through with the bullshit.

1656
01:23:50,813 --> 01:23:54,192
Eazy put everything on Jerry,
Jerry put everything on Eazy.

1657
01:23:55,026 --> 01:23:56,986
It's a two-man show up there.
There ain't no fuckin' group.

1658
01:23:57,028 --> 01:24:00,406
I get that,
but I just want you to understand

1659
01:24:00,615 --> 01:24:03,576
that you are walking away
from a winning situation.

1660
01:24:04,494 --> 01:24:07,054
Now, how do you feel about this, Kim?
Is he making a big mistake?

1661
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:08,164
- A mistake?
- Yes.

1662
01:24:08,248 --> 01:24:09,624
I don't think so, okay.

1663
01:24:09,666 --> 01:24:12,168
After hearing all the stuff
that he went through, I would've left too.

1664
01:24:12,418 --> 01:24:15,171
Look, I want you to express yourself, Cube.

1665
01:24:15,255 --> 01:24:17,590
And I am your biggest fan.
I believe in you.

1666
01:24:17,674 --> 01:24:19,759
But I just want you to understand,

1667
01:24:19,842 --> 01:24:21,803
there's not a lot of
money in this solo play.

1668
01:24:22,220 --> 01:24:23,346
Okay?

1669
01:24:23,596 --> 01:24:25,181
But if the first record hits,

1670
01:24:25,765 --> 01:24:27,485
I will make it up to you on the second one.

1671
01:24:36,025 --> 01:24:37,735
Be ready, Bryan.

1672
01:24:37,944 --> 01:24:39,696
These records is comin' in fast.

1673
01:24:39,862 --> 01:24:42,156
I heard payback's a motherfucking nigga

1674
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:45,577
That's why I'm sick
of getting treated like a goddamn stepchild

1675
01:24:45,660 --> 01:24:46,995
Fuck a punk 'cause I ain't him

1676
01:24:47,036 --> 01:24:49,247
You gotta deal with the nine-double-M

1677
01:24:49,330 --> 01:24:50,999
The damn scum that you all hate

1678
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:53,626
just think if niggas decide to retaliate

1679
01:24:53,710 --> 01:24:55,295
They try to keep me from running up

1680
01:24:55,378 --> 01:24:58,131
I never tell you to get down,
it's all about coming up

1681
01:24:58,214 --> 01:25:00,133
So what they do, go and ban the AK?

1682
01:25:00,216 --> 01:25:02,552
My shit wasn't registered any fucking way

1683
01:25:02,635 --> 01:25:04,721
So you better duck away, run and hide out

1684
01:25:04,804 --> 01:25:07,015
When I'm rolling real
slow and the lights out

1685
01:25:07,056 --> 01:25:09,225
'Cause I'm about to fuck up the program

1686
01:25:09,267 --> 01:25:11,477
Shooting out the window
of a drop-top Brougham

1687
01:25:11,561 --> 01:25:13,563
When I'm shooting let's see who drop

1688
01:25:13,646 --> 01:25:15,899
The police, the media,
suckers that went pop

1689
01:25:15,982 --> 01:25:18,067
And motherfuckers that say they too black

1690
01:25:18,109 --> 01:25:20,361
Put 'em overseas
they'll be begging to come back

1691
01:25:20,403 --> 01:25:22,447
They say he promote gangs and drugs

1692
01:26:29,556 --> 01:26:32,684
You know Cube's record
is in the Top 20 Billboard, right now?

1693
01:26:33,101 --> 01:26:36,312
Our shit never been up there.
He blowin' the fuck up, Jerry.

1694
01:26:36,396 --> 01:26:37,605
It's gonna be fine, Eric.

1695
01:26:37,689 --> 01:26:39,983
It's not just N.W.A anymore,

1696
01:26:40,233 --> 01:26:41,776
it's our whole Ruthless roster.

1697
01:26:41,859 --> 01:26:45,363
We got D.O.C.,
we got Michel'le, we got Above the Law.

1698
01:26:45,655 --> 01:26:47,824
We're moving up to the next level.

1699
01:26:48,283 --> 01:26:49,883
You know what? Sit down for two seconds.

1700
01:26:49,951 --> 01:26:51,411
Look, we need to keep Dre happy.

1701
01:26:51,494 --> 01:26:52,912
Yeah.

1702
01:26:53,663 --> 01:26:54,747
Look at him.

1703
01:26:54,831 --> 01:26:56,751
You think he needs
any more motivation than that?

1704
01:26:56,791 --> 01:26:57,834
I mean, I get it, Jerry.

1705
01:26:57,917 --> 01:27:00,128
He drownin' in pussy and shit,
but that don't mean that he...

1706
01:27:00,169 --> 01:27:03,172
Now, you worry too much. Stop, okay?

1707
01:27:03,298 --> 01:27:04,632
Yeah, ar'ight.

1708
01:27:04,674 --> 01:27:06,175
Here, sign some checks.

1709
01:27:07,051 --> 01:27:08,595
- Right now, Jerry?
- Yes, right now.

1710
01:27:08,678 --> 01:27:10,054
- You're gonna be out of your mind later.
- Come on.

1711
01:27:10,179 --> 01:27:11,347
Do it now.

1712
01:27:11,431 --> 01:27:13,683
The fact is,
Ren is as good a writer as Cube.

1713
01:27:13,766 --> 01:27:15,101
Maybe even better.

1714
01:27:15,310 --> 01:27:16,519
We got everything covered.

1715
01:27:16,603 --> 01:27:18,855
Just the last one. Okay?

1716
01:27:20,940 --> 01:27:22,942
- We finished here, Jerry?
- We're finished.

1717
01:27:23,443 --> 01:27:26,487
Good. 'Cause I'm about to go fuck.

1718
01:27:28,364 --> 01:27:29,991
- Ar'ight.
- Yeah.

1719
01:28:09,656 --> 01:28:11,407
Now I'm only telling you what you told me.

1720
01:28:11,574 --> 01:28:13,284
If AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted blew up,

1721
01:28:13,368 --> 01:28:15,245
you'd pay me the advance for the follow-up.

1722
01:28:15,411 --> 01:28:16,746
Now is that not what the fuck you said?

1723
01:28:16,788 --> 01:28:18,206
That is what I said.

1724
01:28:18,248 --> 01:28:20,166
But it is more complicated than that, Cube.

1725
01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:21,251
Right, there are metrics...

1726
01:28:21,292 --> 01:28:22,335
Come on, Bryan!

1727
01:28:22,418 --> 01:28:24,963
I got a baby on the way
and a house I just paid for

1728
01:28:25,046 --> 01:28:26,798
off the strength of what you told me.

1729
01:28:26,965 --> 01:28:28,424
I mean, you gave me your word!

1730
01:28:28,466 --> 01:28:29,926
Cube, would you just calm down?

1731
01:28:30,009 --> 01:28:31,052
Calm down?

1732
01:28:31,094 --> 01:28:32,595
I am just trying to give you what you want.

1733
01:28:32,637 --> 01:28:34,305
You not. I been did the work...

1734
01:28:34,430 --> 01:28:37,225
I gave you the product.
Give me my money, Bryan!

1735
01:28:38,142 --> 01:28:40,937
When a man does the job,
he's supposed to get paid,

1736
01:28:40,979 --> 01:28:44,190
and you making it seem like I'm beggin'
for some shit that's technically mine.

1737
01:28:44,274 --> 01:28:46,859
Of course you are not begging.

1738
01:28:46,943 --> 01:28:50,363
And I am not trying to be difficult, man.
I promise you.

1739
01:28:53,157 --> 01:28:54,993
But you can't help me, right?

1740
01:28:56,286 --> 01:28:58,454
That's what you telling me?

1741
01:28:59,831 --> 01:29:01,457
My hands are tied, man.

1742
01:29:30,737 --> 01:29:31,738
Hey!

1743
01:29:33,197 --> 01:29:35,241
Shoulda kept your word, Bryan.

1744
01:29:36,701 --> 01:29:38,369
Jesus Christ, man!

1745
01:29:38,786 --> 01:29:40,955
What the fuck are you doing, Cube?

1746
01:29:41,122 --> 01:29:42,123
Goddamn!

1747
01:29:43,458 --> 01:29:46,085
I will get you your money, man.
Just... God damn it!

1748
01:29:46,169 --> 01:29:48,046
You think I give a fuck
about these fucking records?

1749
01:29:48,129 --> 01:29:50,506
I put up these fuckin' records!
This my shit!

1750
01:29:50,673 --> 01:29:53,259
I know that, Cube!
I will get you your money!

1751
01:29:53,343 --> 01:29:55,011
God damn it! I'm sorry.

1752
01:29:55,094 --> 01:29:56,346
Now I'm gonna fuck up your shit.

1753
01:29:56,387 --> 01:29:57,513
Look, do not...

1754
01:29:59,182 --> 01:30:00,391
God damn it!

1755
01:30:04,020 --> 01:30:05,772
Just, fine.

1756
01:30:07,482 --> 01:30:09,609
Take it out what you owe me.

1757
01:30:09,859 --> 01:30:11,694
Just...

1758
01:30:21,663 --> 01:30:23,081
Prisoner like a hostage

1759
01:30:23,248 --> 01:30:25,917
Yo, you shoulda covered
your muthafucking head like an ostrich

1760
01:30:26,125 --> 01:30:27,961
Deep in the dirt 'cause you's a sucker

1761
01:30:28,127 --> 01:30:30,463
And your ass up high
so I can kick the muthafucker

1762
01:30:30,630 --> 01:30:32,465
Don't try to hang your best abroad

1763
01:30:32,632 --> 01:30:35,192
'Cause my foot will be so
far up your ass, you'll get hemorrhoids

1764
01:30:35,301 --> 01:30:36,761
Before you try to fuck wit Ren

1765
01:30:37,178 --> 01:30:39,097
See that shit right there?
That's what I'm talking about.

1766
01:30:39,264 --> 01:30:41,015
Fuck that nigga Cube, man.
That nigga ain't shit.

1767
01:30:41,182 --> 01:30:43,851
How you figure, man? His record the
hottest shit out right now, E.

1768
01:30:44,018 --> 01:30:46,312
Yeah, man, for real. Cube killed that shit.

1769
01:30:46,479 --> 01:30:48,856
So we supposed to
just sit there and not say nothin',

1770
01:30:48,898 --> 01:30:50,233
and look like bitches and just take it?

1771
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:51,901
Take what?

1772
01:30:52,068 --> 01:30:55,488
I don't know what the fuck you
talkin' about. I like that shit.

1773
01:30:57,240 --> 01:30:58,283
Clown-ass.

1774
01:30:58,366 --> 01:31:00,076
Why you drunk all the goddamn time?

1775
01:31:00,159 --> 01:31:02,412
You need to get your shit together.
You's a motherfucking' artist,

1776
01:31:02,453 --> 01:31:03,872
if you ain't noticed.

1777
01:31:04,789 --> 01:31:07,125
How about you get
your shit together, little nigga.

1778
01:31:07,250 --> 01:31:08,251
Come on.

1779
01:31:08,376 --> 01:31:10,420
How about you get
your country-ass homeboy.

1780
01:31:10,587 --> 01:31:13,506
'Cause the vocals were local in nightclubs
And not getting paid in full

1781
01:31:13,673 --> 01:31:16,467
They got the nerve to cuss
Only reason niggaz pick up your record

1782
01:31:16,634 --> 01:31:18,386
is cause they thought it was us

1783
01:31:30,523 --> 01:31:31,608
Hello.

1784
01:31:31,649 --> 01:31:33,735
Yo, Dre. D.O.C. was in an accident.

1785
01:31:33,902 --> 01:31:36,321
What? An accident?

1786
01:31:45,413 --> 01:31:46,789
D.O.C. shouldn't even be alive.

1787
01:31:46,956 --> 01:31:48,833
Got thrown out a car, hit a tree.

1788
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,376
Is he paralyzed?

1789
01:31:50,543 --> 01:31:53,671
No. But his throat got crushed.

1790
01:31:53,838 --> 01:31:55,965
He could lose his career over this.

1791
01:31:58,134 --> 01:32:00,094
Where your people? Where Eazy and Jerry?

1792
01:32:00,261 --> 01:32:02,513
How the fuck should I know?

1793
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:03,932
Come here.

1794
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:08,394
Whatchu know about Jerry?
Whatchu think about him?

1795
01:32:08,561 --> 01:32:11,147
He a'ight. I guess.

1796
01:32:11,314 --> 01:32:14,025
What about your paperwork?
You cool with that?

1797
01:32:16,277 --> 01:32:17,278
I think.

1798
01:32:17,445 --> 01:32:18,488
You think?

1799
01:32:18,529 --> 01:32:20,531
Look, I just focus on the music, Suge.

1800
01:32:21,115 --> 01:32:22,659
That's it.

1801
01:32:23,159 --> 01:32:25,703
You see that motherfucker in there?

1802
01:32:27,330 --> 01:32:29,624
Gotta make sure it don't
happen to you, man.

1803
01:32:32,377 --> 01:32:33,878
Hey, uh...

1804
01:32:35,380 --> 01:32:38,883
Maybe some of your people
can look into my paperwork, too.

1805
01:32:41,302 --> 01:32:42,762
Most definitely.

1806
01:32:42,929 --> 01:32:44,681
I'll arrange.

1807
01:32:44,847 --> 01:32:46,391
Go see your boy.

1808
01:32:56,442 --> 01:32:58,194
This place is nice.

1809
01:32:58,236 --> 01:33:02,198
You're nice.
I figured I'd take you to a nice place,

1810
01:33:02,282 --> 01:33:04,409
Ms. Record Executive.

1811
01:33:04,492 --> 01:33:06,953
Um, record executive assistant.

1812
01:33:07,370 --> 01:33:08,663
But, damn.

1813
01:33:09,372 --> 01:33:13,001
I didn't realize we was going on
like a "date" date.

1814
01:33:13,501 --> 01:33:15,044
I don't even know how to take that.

1815
01:33:15,128 --> 01:33:18,381
I got my collared shirt on. I brought
you to this nice restaurant. Really?

1816
01:33:18,464 --> 01:33:21,217
Okay. That is not the
kind of collared shirt

1817
01:33:21,342 --> 01:33:22,760
they was talking about.

1818
01:33:22,844 --> 01:33:24,053
It's cute, though.

1819
01:33:24,137 --> 01:33:26,848
And you didn't take off
your hat like they asked you to.

1820
01:33:26,890 --> 01:33:28,224
And I'm not.

1821
01:33:28,308 --> 01:33:30,852
- Oh, really?
- I ain't taking off my hat for nobody.

1822
01:33:30,894 --> 01:33:32,937
I think they know that.

1823
01:33:33,021 --> 01:33:34,022
So what?

1824
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:37,692
You bring all your little
females here, don't you?

1825
01:33:37,984 --> 01:33:39,402
The special ones.

1826
01:33:41,905 --> 01:33:42,906
Okay.

1827
01:33:44,407 --> 01:33:48,161
I'm playing. I'm playing.
There you go getting sensitive.

1828
01:33:48,494 --> 01:33:50,121
You don't have to try to impress me.

1829
01:33:50,622 --> 01:33:52,790
We could've went to Fatburger.

1830
01:33:53,249 --> 01:33:55,251
Go to Fatburger?

1831
01:33:55,752 --> 01:33:58,755
Hey! You got a haircut. I love it.

1832
01:33:59,756 --> 01:34:00,924
How's that new house treating you?

1833
01:34:01,007 --> 01:34:02,592
It's great. Thanks for asking.

1834
01:34:03,343 --> 01:34:06,346
So, how you liking your new decor?

1835
01:34:06,512 --> 01:34:07,513
Great.

1836
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:09,599
Yeah, I never did like
the old design anyway, you know?

1837
01:34:09,766 --> 01:34:11,059
What you got for me, Bryan?

1838
01:34:11,100 --> 01:34:12,820
I know you called me up here for somethin'.

1839
01:34:14,270 --> 01:34:15,396
Yeah.

1840
01:34:18,608 --> 01:34:20,193
It's N.W.A's new record.

1841
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:24,155
I wanted to play it for you first,
before you hear it anywhere else.

1842
01:34:25,448 --> 01:34:27,742
Break me, take me
But watch me pull the trigger

1843
01:34:27,784 --> 01:34:30,036
Dre is just a nigga with
heart a nigga that's smart

1844
01:34:30,119 --> 01:34:32,789
A nigga that's paid to say
what others are scared to play

1845
01:34:32,830 --> 01:34:36,334
We started out with too much cargo
So I'm glad we got rid of Benedict Arnold

1846
01:34:36,459 --> 01:34:37,585
Yo, N.W...

1847
01:34:37,794 --> 01:34:38,962
Benedict Arnold?

1848
01:34:40,797 --> 01:34:42,757
Are they trying to say
that you're like a traitor?

1849
01:34:43,132 --> 01:34:44,175
Yeah.

1850
01:34:44,259 --> 01:34:45,802
I'm a fuckin' traitor?

1851
01:34:46,261 --> 01:34:48,221
I didn't say shit about them
on AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted!

1852
01:34:48,304 --> 01:34:49,973
Now they trying to diss?

1853
01:34:51,766 --> 01:34:55,144
Goddamn, I'm glad y'all
set it off Used to be hard

1854
01:34:55,270 --> 01:34:56,521
Now you're just wet and soft

1855
01:34:56,604 --> 01:34:58,815
First you was down with the AK

1856
01:34:58,898 --> 01:35:01,276
And now I see you on a video with Michel'le

1857
01:35:01,317 --> 01:35:05,822
Looking like straight bozos
I saw it coming that's why I went solo

1858
01:35:06,072 --> 01:35:07,740
And kept on stompin'

1859
01:35:07,824 --> 01:35:10,326
While y'all mothafuckers
moved straight outta Compton

1860
01:35:10,660 --> 01:35:14,956
Living with the whites one big house
And not another nigga in sight

1861
01:35:15,123 --> 01:35:17,166
I started off with too much cargo

1862
01:35:17,208 --> 01:35:19,419
Dropped four niggas
Now I'm making all the dough

1863
01:35:19,502 --> 01:35:23,965
White man just ruling
The Niggas With Attitudes? Who ya fooling?

1864
01:35:24,132 --> 01:35:27,927
Y'all niggas just phony
I put that on my mama and my dead homies

1865
01:35:28,595 --> 01:35:30,638
Yella Boy's on your team so you're losing

1866
01:35:30,680 --> 01:35:32,765
Hey, yo, Dre, stick to producing

1867
01:35:32,849 --> 01:35:34,976
Calling me Arnold but you bent-a-dick

1868
01:35:35,143 --> 01:35:37,437
Eazy-E saw your ass and went in it quick

1869
01:35:37,604 --> 01:35:39,647
You got jealous when I got my own company

1870
01:35:39,814 --> 01:35:42,025
But I'm a man, and ain't nobody humping me

1871
01:35:42,191 --> 01:35:43,776
Trying to sound like Amerikkka's Most

1872
01:35:43,860 --> 01:35:46,529
You could yell all day
but you don't come close

1873
01:35:46,696 --> 01:35:48,865
'Cause you know I'm the one
that flowed ya done run 100 miles

1874
01:35:48,948 --> 01:35:51,117
but you still got one to go

1875
01:35:51,284 --> 01:35:55,872
With the L-E-N-C-H M-O-B,
and y'all disgrace the C-P-T

1876
01:35:56,039 --> 01:35:58,708
'Cause you're getting fucked
out your green by a white boy

1877
01:35:58,875 --> 01:36:00,168
With no Vaseline

1878
01:36:00,710 --> 01:36:02,837
Now you're getting done without Vaseline

1879
01:36:05,006 --> 01:36:06,966
Damn, it feels good to see people, on it

1880
01:36:07,133 --> 01:36:09,010
The bigger the cap bigger the peeling

1881
01:36:09,177 --> 01:36:11,346
Who gives a fuck about a punk-ass villain

1882
01:36:11,512 --> 01:36:15,892
You're getting fucked real quick and
Eazy's dick is smelling like MC Ren's shit

1883
01:36:16,059 --> 01:36:20,355
Tried to tell you a year ago But Willie
D told me to let a ho be a ho, so

1884
01:36:20,521 --> 01:36:22,232
I couldn't stop you from getting ganked

1885
01:36:22,398 --> 01:36:25,193
Now let's play big-bank-take-little-bank

1886
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:27,195
Tried to diss Ice Cube,
it wasn't worth it 'cause

1887
01:36:27,278 --> 01:36:29,405
the broomstick fit your ass so perfect

1888
01:36:29,739 --> 01:36:31,366
Cut my hair and I'll cut them balls

1889
01:36:31,532 --> 01:36:33,868
'cause I heard you like
giving up the drawers

1890
01:36:34,035 --> 01:36:36,079
Gang-banged by your manager, fella
Getting money out

1891
01:36:36,120 --> 01:36:39,040
your ass like a mothafucking ready teller

1892
01:36:39,207 --> 01:36:41,000
Giving up the dollar bills

1893
01:36:41,167 --> 01:36:43,253
Now they got the villain with
a purse and high heels

1894
01:36:43,419 --> 01:36:45,088
So don't believe what Ren say

1895
01:36:45,255 --> 01:36:47,423
'cause he's going out like Kunte Kinte

1896
01:36:47,590 --> 01:36:50,760
But I got a whip for ya, Toby
Used to be my homie

1897
01:36:50,843 --> 01:36:52,428
and now you act like you don't know me

1898
01:36:52,595 --> 01:36:54,764
It's a case of divide-and-conquer

1899
01:36:54,847 --> 01:36:56,808
'Cause you let a Jew break up my crew

1900
01:36:56,891 --> 01:36:58,434
House nigga gotta run...

1901
01:37:03,106 --> 01:37:04,732
That shit's kinda funny.

1902
01:37:06,693 --> 01:37:08,444
That motherfucker got us!

1903
01:37:09,279 --> 01:37:10,613
Yo, what we about to do?

1904
01:37:10,697 --> 01:37:12,699
First thing we're gonna do,
we're gonna sue this ignorant fuck.

1905
01:37:12,865 --> 01:37:13,945
That's what we're gonna do.

1906
01:37:14,075 --> 01:37:16,452
Defamation of character,
libel, I don't really care.

1907
01:37:16,619 --> 01:37:20,582
That anti-Semitic piece of fuckin' shit.
Who the fuck does he think he is?

1908
01:37:20,748 --> 01:37:21,958
Un-fucking-believable.

1909
01:37:22,125 --> 01:37:25,795
That kind of fucking bullshit!
Jew-bashing bullshit!

1910
01:37:26,796 --> 01:37:29,048
You know what?
I'll call my friend at the JDL.

1911
01:37:29,215 --> 01:37:30,884
They'll handle him.
We'll see how much he likes that.

1912
01:37:31,050 --> 01:37:32,468
Jerry, you gotta relax. Ar'ight?

1913
01:37:32,635 --> 01:37:34,846
Niggas don't even know what
anti-Semitic means anyway.

1914
01:37:34,929 --> 01:37:35,930
It's just a fucking battle rap.

1915
01:37:35,972 --> 01:37:37,492
Come on, Eric, we gotta get organized.

1916
01:37:37,599 --> 01:37:40,226
We got to fight this kinda
ignorant fucking bullshit.

1917
01:37:40,393 --> 01:37:42,873
You know what? I always knew
that he was a hateful human being.

1918
01:37:42,979 --> 01:37:44,314
This is just ignorant shit.

1919
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:46,774
He calls it political?
This is ignorant shit!

1920
01:37:46,816 --> 01:37:49,485
I always knew it.
Now the whole world is gonna know.

1921
01:37:49,652 --> 01:37:51,487
I'm gonna make sure of that. Okay?

1922
01:37:51,654 --> 01:37:54,407
I don't understand why the fuck
you're not more angry about this?

1923
01:37:54,574 --> 01:37:56,034
- Did you hear what he said?
- I heard what he said!

1924
01:37:56,117 --> 01:37:57,744
- Did you hear what he said?
- I heard what he said!

1925
01:37:57,827 --> 01:37:59,454
About you? About me? Come on!

1926
01:37:59,495 --> 01:38:02,498
You got your way
of dealing with it, I got mine.

1927
01:38:06,336 --> 01:38:09,505
We could just go the studio
and just end his fucking career anyway.

1928
01:38:10,757 --> 01:38:12,383
I don't know about all that.

1929
01:38:14,677 --> 01:38:18,348
Fine, you do that.
You call Dre, and you guys go do that.

1930
01:38:18,514 --> 01:38:19,807
Do something!

1931
01:38:23,853 --> 01:38:26,606
Damn, E. Who work for who?

1932
01:38:26,773 --> 01:38:29,984
What? You questioning that?

1933
01:38:30,151 --> 01:38:31,986
My position is fucking solidified!

1934
01:38:32,153 --> 01:38:34,614
Don't never question that shit!

1935
01:38:36,032 --> 01:38:37,867
Fuckin' Cube, man!

1936
01:38:40,495 --> 01:38:41,496
Nigga.

1937
01:38:42,330 --> 01:38:44,832
Hey, there go the nigga Cube right there.

1938
01:38:45,375 --> 01:38:46,793
What that Ruthless like, nigga?

1939
01:38:47,210 --> 01:38:49,254
Fuck Ruthless! This Lench Mob, nigga.

1940
01:38:49,337 --> 01:38:51,257
- Fuck Lench Mob.
- Come here, motherfucker.

1941
01:38:52,382 --> 01:38:53,383
Oh, shit!

1942
01:38:57,220 --> 01:38:58,221
Shit!

1943
01:39:01,683 --> 01:39:02,725
Oh, shit!

1944
01:39:08,731 --> 01:39:09,732
Motherfucker!

1945
01:39:13,403 --> 01:39:16,489
We've all seen the pictures
of Los Angeles police officers

1946
01:39:16,656 --> 01:39:18,575
beating a man they had just pulled over.

1947
01:39:18,741 --> 01:39:20,101
The city's police chief said today

1948
01:39:20,201 --> 01:39:22,871
he will support criminal charges
against some of the men.

1949
01:39:23,037 --> 01:39:24,080
Here's ABC's Gary Shepard.

1950
01:39:24,247 --> 01:39:26,875
At least we got the motherfuckers on video.

1951
01:39:27,041 --> 01:39:29,210
LAPD gonna have a real good time
on that level three prison yard.

1952
01:39:29,252 --> 01:39:30,753
You know what I'm saying?

1953
01:39:31,045 --> 01:39:33,381
Dre, maybe we should
try to get back to work.

1954
01:39:33,548 --> 01:39:35,091
We are working, Jerry.

1955
01:39:35,258 --> 01:39:36,634
I'm having a word with my client.

1956
01:39:36,718 --> 01:39:39,053
Man, hold up, man! We got this!

1957
01:39:39,220 --> 01:39:41,931
Nah. We got it.

1958
01:39:45,268 --> 01:39:47,186
You done? Suge?

1959
01:39:47,353 --> 01:39:49,606
Jerry? E?

1960
01:39:49,939 --> 01:39:52,442
Brutality and misconduct
that goes back a quarter of a century

1961
01:39:52,609 --> 01:39:55,069
including one incident
that sparked the Watts Riots.

1962
01:39:55,236 --> 01:39:58,156
So far this year,
there have been more than 125

1963
01:39:58,239 --> 01:40:00,200
complaints of police misconduct

1964
01:40:00,366 --> 01:40:02,619
filed with watchdog organizations.

1965
01:40:03,411 --> 01:40:05,330
Yo, Dre. Hold up.

1966
01:40:06,122 --> 01:40:07,790
Look, I did what you asked me to do.

1967
01:40:07,874 --> 01:40:10,460
I had my people look at your contracts.

1968
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:12,712
It didn't look good.

1969
01:40:12,795 --> 01:40:14,130
But you gotta watch your back.

1970
01:40:15,298 --> 01:40:16,424
What you mean by that?

1971
01:40:16,466 --> 01:40:19,302
Look, everything you need to know is here.

1972
01:40:21,846 --> 01:40:24,140
And you know I can help you with this.

1973
01:40:45,495 --> 01:40:47,664
May I help you with something?

1974
01:40:49,332 --> 01:40:50,917
This your house?

1975
01:40:53,962 --> 01:40:55,505
Who's asking?

1976
01:41:00,051 --> 01:41:01,177
It's a nice house.

1977
01:41:03,846 --> 01:41:07,600
Who are you? You're with Suge Knight?

1978
01:41:10,311 --> 01:41:13,231
Someone else? Ice Cube?

1979
01:41:14,816 --> 01:41:16,359
Have yourself a good night.

1980
01:41:18,861 --> 01:41:19,946
Jerry.

1981
01:41:30,373 --> 01:41:31,499
Shit.

1982
01:41:59,193 --> 01:42:00,403
So, wassup?

1983
01:42:02,363 --> 01:42:06,367
When you talked to me on the phone, man,
you sounded pretty worked up.

1984
01:42:10,246 --> 01:42:12,373
Yeah, I know you don't
like hearing this shit.

1985
01:42:13,750 --> 01:42:17,503
It's about Jerry.
We gotta get rid of that motherfucker, E.

1986
01:42:19,047 --> 01:42:21,132
That's really why you came here?

1987
01:42:21,925 --> 01:42:24,510
I thought all this shit
was in the past, Dre.

1988
01:42:27,180 --> 01:42:30,600
I found some real shit, man. And the shit's
been happening since the beginning.

1989
01:42:30,934 --> 01:42:33,686
I had some people look into this.
I ain't been gettin' my fair share.

1990
01:42:33,770 --> 01:42:35,772
Do you even know why you rich, though?

1991
01:42:36,272 --> 01:42:37,941
Do you know why you got
a big-ass house and you

1992
01:42:38,024 --> 01:42:39,943
ain't sleepin' on your
auntie's couch no more?

1993
01:42:40,109 --> 01:42:42,695
Because Jerry made that possible for us.

1994
01:42:42,862 --> 01:42:45,782
He kicked down the door
for that shit to happen. For us!

1995
01:42:45,949 --> 01:42:47,951
And you just gonna turn your back on him?
What, you Cube now?

1996
01:42:48,034 --> 01:42:49,577
Cube was right, fool!

1997
01:42:51,120 --> 01:42:54,624
E, look at the papers, man, and you'll
see what the fuck I'm talking about.

1998
01:42:55,792 --> 01:42:59,170
And forget about Jerry, man! You keep
talking about Jerry this, Jerry that.

1999
01:42:59,254 --> 01:43:02,715
We didn't make it because of Jerry,
we made it because our shit is dope!

2000
01:43:04,717 --> 01:43:06,427
And we can keep going, E.

2001
01:43:06,469 --> 01:43:10,682
We can own the goddamn world, but we
just can't be fucking with him no more.

2002
01:43:12,934 --> 01:43:15,478
Man, we started this N.W.A shit.

2003
01:43:18,314 --> 01:43:19,941
I just want it to be right.

2004
01:43:20,775 --> 01:43:22,652
And this what you think right?

2005
01:43:23,695 --> 01:43:26,364
Turnin' your back on somebody
after all he done for us.

2006
01:43:27,073 --> 01:43:29,033
You mean all he done for you.

2007
01:43:30,326 --> 01:43:31,411
Right?

2008
01:43:33,371 --> 01:43:34,455
Look at me.

2009
01:43:37,166 --> 01:43:38,293
Look at me.

2010
01:43:43,006 --> 01:43:44,340
When Tyree died,

2011
01:43:47,093 --> 01:43:49,262
you said we was always gonna be brothers.

2012
01:43:51,306 --> 01:43:53,433
I guess you forgot about that.

2013
01:43:56,519 --> 01:43:58,897
I'mma start my own company
with Suge Knight, E.

2014
01:44:13,036 --> 01:44:15,121
Thought we were brothers, man.

2015
01:44:42,815 --> 01:44:44,025
What up, Dre?

2016
01:44:44,067 --> 01:44:46,194
This Death Row. We about to do this shit.

2017
01:44:52,575 --> 01:44:54,410
This shit sound good.

2018
01:44:55,036 --> 01:44:59,541
Yeah. None of it means anything
while I'm under contract with Ruthless.

2019
01:45:00,083 --> 01:45:02,043
I told you about that.

2020
01:45:02,210 --> 01:45:04,671
I'mma get you outta your contracts,
I promise you.

2021
01:45:06,089 --> 01:45:07,507
Yeah, ar'ight.

2022
01:45:13,721 --> 01:45:15,181
What up with you, cuz?

2023
01:45:15,348 --> 01:45:16,766
Wuddup?

2024
01:45:16,933 --> 01:45:18,017
What up, Lo?

2025
01:45:18,101 --> 01:45:19,310
Wuddup, Dre?

2026
01:45:19,435 --> 01:45:21,521
- Wassup, Warren?
- Chilin' man.

2027
01:45:21,688 --> 01:45:23,008
- You good?
- I'm great. You good?

2028
01:45:23,106 --> 01:45:24,607
- All right.

2029
01:45:24,774 --> 01:45:26,442
- 'Sup?
- Wuddup with you?

2030
01:45:26,526 --> 01:45:27,610
What's goin' on, man?

2031
01:45:27,819 --> 01:45:28,903
Yeah, yeah.

2032
01:45:28,987 --> 01:45:31,447
So, look, I listened to your demo.

2033
01:45:32,198 --> 01:45:33,575
It was tight.

2034
01:45:34,909 --> 01:45:37,287
You see that little look he gave me?

2035
01:45:37,453 --> 01:45:40,790
Yo, yo, yo, hold up.
Who the fuck is this guy?

2036
01:45:40,957 --> 01:45:43,209
My bad, Suge. This the homie, Snoop.

2037
01:45:43,960 --> 01:45:46,296
Snoop D-O-double-G, cuz. Who you?

2038
01:45:46,462 --> 01:45:47,755
What? What up?

2039
01:45:47,922 --> 01:45:49,299
What the fuck you say, Blood?

2040
01:45:49,465 --> 01:45:52,594
Hold on! Hold on, hold on.
He with me. He with me.

2041
01:45:53,553 --> 01:45:54,637
He ain't with me.

2042
01:45:54,721 --> 01:45:58,141
Nah! He here to work, ar'ight?
This is business, Suge. Come on, man.

2043
01:45:58,308 --> 01:46:01,144
Anyway, what's this
you workin' on, cuz, I like this.

2044
01:46:01,311 --> 01:46:02,937
So look, you know...

2045
01:46:02,979 --> 01:46:05,607
It's a new track for this new movie.
It's called Deep Cover.

2046
01:46:06,900 --> 01:46:08,067
- Woo-wee.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

2047
01:46:08,234 --> 01:46:09,986
- For a movie, huh?
- Yeah, a movie.

2048
01:46:10,153 --> 01:46:12,488
Dre doing big shit. Okay, okay, okay.

2049
01:46:12,655 --> 01:46:14,699
You think you can get down on it?

2050
01:46:14,782 --> 01:46:18,161
Oh, most definitely.
Throw me in the booth one time.

2051
01:46:18,828 --> 01:46:19,996
All right.

2052
01:46:25,168 --> 01:46:28,504
It's perhaps the most notorious
police brutality case in recent memory.

2053
01:46:28,671 --> 01:46:32,508
Those blows from
Officer Powell and Officer Wind's batons

2054
01:46:32,675 --> 01:46:38,431
continued and continued for no just reason.

2055
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:40,892
They just let them people do
whatever the hell they want.

2056
01:46:42,268 --> 01:46:44,646
Rodney King's leg
and facial bones were broken.

2057
01:46:44,687 --> 01:46:48,942
Three of the four accused officers took
the stand and admitted that it was brutal,

2058
01:46:49,108 --> 01:46:52,028
but said, "Police work is brutal."
And that the video tape only showed that.

2059
01:46:52,070 --> 01:46:53,238
Here.

2060
01:46:53,321 --> 01:46:55,156
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

2061
01:46:55,323 --> 01:46:56,699
You watchin' this shit upstairs?

2062
01:46:56,866 --> 01:46:57,867
Hello?

2063
01:46:57,951 --> 01:46:59,035
Yo, it's Suge.

2064
01:46:59,077 --> 01:47:00,517
We gotta talk about these contracts.

2065
01:47:00,870 --> 01:47:02,789
Why you don't talk to
Jerry about that shit?

2066
01:47:02,956 --> 01:47:07,001
I don't wanna talk to Jerry.
It's your company. You the man.

2067
01:47:07,544 --> 01:47:12,090
Ar'ight. Whatever, man.
I'll be through there.

2068
01:47:15,718 --> 01:47:17,637
- Who was that?
- Nobody.

2069
01:47:17,804 --> 01:47:19,444
...right across the top of the cheekbone,

2070
01:47:19,514 --> 01:47:21,808
splitting his face
from the top of his ear to his chin.

2071
01:47:29,732 --> 01:47:30,733
Where Dre at?

2072
01:47:31,734 --> 01:47:33,069
You said he was gonna be here.

2073
01:47:33,236 --> 01:47:35,655
I'll get with you outside.

2074
01:47:35,822 --> 01:47:37,782
Don't worry about Dre.

2075
01:47:37,949 --> 01:47:41,244
Truth be told,
he got nothing to do with this.

2076
01:47:47,333 --> 01:47:49,085
This what's gonna happen.

2077
01:47:50,587 --> 01:47:54,841
You gonna sign these,
releasing Dre and D.O.C. from Ruthless.

2078
01:47:59,637 --> 01:48:01,097
Whatever, homie.

2079
01:48:04,601 --> 01:48:07,478
Think I'm signing that?
You crazier than I thought you was.

2080
01:48:07,645 --> 01:48:08,855
I'm out.

2081
01:48:13,109 --> 01:48:15,278
Get your ass up.

2082
01:48:15,445 --> 01:48:18,781
Nah. I think you're gonna
stay here for a while.

2083
01:48:18,948 --> 01:48:22,493
Fuck you, Suge!
Y'all niggas don't scare me.

2084
01:48:22,577 --> 01:48:26,956
You can talk tough all you want,
but this ain't no record.

2085
01:48:27,832 --> 01:48:29,500
Don't make me change you, Eric.

2086
01:48:29,667 --> 01:48:31,169
Fuck that's supposed to mean?

2087
01:48:31,336 --> 01:48:33,630
Keep talkin',
you're gonna fuck around and get smoked.

2088
01:48:33,796 --> 01:48:36,799
Nah, nah.
But you better choose right.

2089
01:48:36,966 --> 01:48:40,803
You know where the fuck I'm from.
This Bompton, nigga.

2090
01:49:07,997 --> 01:49:09,832
Oh, my fucking God.

2091
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:11,626
Eric.

2092
01:49:12,168 --> 01:49:13,920
Jesus Christ.

2093
01:49:14,420 --> 01:49:18,800
What the hell are you doing here?
You can't sneak in here like that.

2094
01:49:19,008 --> 01:49:20,843
I thought you were...

2095
01:49:22,345 --> 01:49:25,515
Oh, my God. What's going on, man?
Are you okay?

2096
01:49:27,350 --> 01:49:28,810
What happened to your face?

2097
01:49:28,851 --> 01:49:31,563
I gotta kill this motherfucker,
Suge Knight.

2098
01:49:33,356 --> 01:49:36,150
I just came here to let you know,

2099
01:49:36,192 --> 01:49:39,821
'cause shit might get a little thick.
I need to stay protected.

2100
01:49:40,697 --> 01:49:43,992
No, you're not gonna do that. No.

2101
01:49:44,033 --> 01:49:46,327
I didn't come here to ask for permission.

2102
01:49:46,619 --> 01:49:48,788
I came here to let you know.

2103
01:49:49,372 --> 01:49:51,583
You wanted to be involved
with this gangster shit?

2104
01:49:52,041 --> 01:49:53,084
Here we go.

2105
01:49:53,167 --> 01:49:56,379
You do that and you're gonna ruin
everything we've worked for.

2106
01:49:59,340 --> 01:50:01,384
You really think I got a fucking choice?

2107
01:50:01,467 --> 01:50:03,052
Look at my face!

2108
01:50:05,179 --> 01:50:07,724
This the streets. Motherfuckers came at me!

2109
01:50:07,765 --> 01:50:10,101
Came at us!

2110
01:50:10,184 --> 01:50:12,061
If I don't hit back, we finished.
It's over.

2111
01:50:12,103 --> 01:50:14,022
I'm not saying that we're
not gonna hit back.

2112
01:50:14,063 --> 01:50:16,065
But this is not Compton,

2113
01:50:17,275 --> 01:50:18,776
if you haven't looked around.

2114
01:50:18,860 --> 01:50:21,112
Drop that shit, okay?

2115
01:50:21,738 --> 01:50:24,741
We don't hit back with bullets,
we hit back with lawyers.

2116
01:50:24,782 --> 01:50:26,159
We drain these assholes.

2117
01:50:26,242 --> 01:50:28,453
That really takes 'em down.

2118
01:50:28,536 --> 01:50:30,371
It ain't about the money, Jerry!

2119
01:50:32,040 --> 01:50:33,374
I don't care about no money.

2120
01:50:33,416 --> 01:50:36,252
Of course it is. And you should
fucking care about the money.

2121
01:50:37,420 --> 01:50:40,423
You're so much smarter
than these fuckin' thugs.

2122
01:50:40,465 --> 01:50:41,966
You wanna kill somebody?

2123
01:50:42,050 --> 01:50:43,801
You're gonna go to jail forever.

2124
01:50:46,930 --> 01:50:49,557
No more family,
no more Ruthless, no more anything.

2125
01:50:49,599 --> 01:50:51,768
If you kill this man,
his problems will be over

2126
01:50:51,809 --> 01:50:54,312
and yours will just be beginning.

2127
01:50:54,395 --> 01:50:56,314
Don't be a fuckin' fool.

2128
01:50:57,232 --> 01:50:58,233
Hey.

2129
01:50:59,776 --> 01:51:02,654
Why the fuck I gotta be the bigger man?

2130
01:51:03,613 --> 01:51:05,448
'Cause it's better than
you being a dead man.

2131
01:51:05,907 --> 01:51:08,243
I don't want you fuckin' dead.

2132
01:51:46,239 --> 01:51:47,574
You okay?

2133
01:51:53,663 --> 01:51:55,248
Baby. Let me see.

2134
01:53:05,985 --> 01:53:08,404
- Why you so tense, Dre?
- No, I'm cool.

2135
01:53:09,405 --> 01:53:10,782
Man. No, you're not, man.

2136
01:53:10,865 --> 01:53:12,700
You've been in that house, what?
A month now?

2137
01:53:12,742 --> 01:53:15,245
Nigga, and not one track?
I mean, what's up?

2138
01:53:15,870 --> 01:53:17,747
There's too much interference.

2139
01:53:17,789 --> 01:53:20,250
Man, you know how they
tryin' to starve me out.

2140
01:53:20,625 --> 01:53:22,544
Playin' games with
my motherfuckin' money, man.

2141
01:53:22,585 --> 01:53:25,129
That's why the house
was so goddamned empty.

2142
01:53:26,256 --> 01:53:29,342
- Hey, come on, man.
- I'm fucking with you, cuz. Hit this.

2143
01:53:30,134 --> 01:53:32,178
- All right, man, give me that shit.
- Here.

2144
01:53:32,262 --> 01:53:34,097
Fuck I'm taking about.

2145
01:53:35,306 --> 01:53:37,767
Have you feeling righteously together.

2146
01:53:40,436 --> 01:53:41,437
- Holy shit.
- Oh, hell no. Give me that.

2147
01:53:41,521 --> 01:53:45,567
Goddamn, man!
What the fuck is in this shit, Snoops?

2148
01:53:46,025 --> 01:53:49,112
- That right there, that's that chronic, cuz.
- Yeah.

2149
01:53:50,321 --> 01:53:52,323
- Chronic.
- Yes, sir.

2150
01:53:52,407 --> 01:53:54,325
- Let me hit that once.
- Yeah.

2151
01:53:54,409 --> 01:53:56,995
- Look it.
- Wow, man.

2152
01:53:58,204 --> 01:54:01,165
- All right. Let's head back to the studio.
- Let's go.

2153
01:54:01,249 --> 01:54:02,542
I got something for this.

2154
01:54:24,188 --> 01:54:27,191
Damn, Dre.
What the fuck is that? Feeling that shit.

2155
01:54:27,275 --> 01:54:28,651
- Yeah. You feelin' it?
- Yeah!

2156
01:54:28,693 --> 01:54:30,862
Hey, hey, look,
I'mma spit a little something.

2157
01:54:30,945 --> 01:54:31,946
You feel me? You say whatever...

2158
01:54:31,988 --> 01:54:33,323
You just jump in, nigga, and just...

2159
01:54:33,364 --> 01:54:35,084
Hold on, look, I got something. Here we go.

2160
01:54:36,618 --> 01:54:39,162
One, two, three and to the four

2161
01:54:39,204 --> 01:54:41,706
Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the door

2162
01:54:41,789 --> 01:54:44,083
Ready to make an entrance so back on up

2163
01:54:44,167 --> 01:54:46,002
'Cause you know we about to rip shit up

2164
01:54:46,044 --> 01:54:47,170
Give me the microphone first

2165
01:54:47,212 --> 01:54:48,838
so I could bust like a bubble

2166
01:54:48,922 --> 01:54:50,506
Compton and Long Beach together

2167
01:54:50,548 --> 01:54:51,758
now you know you in trouble

2168
01:54:51,841 --> 01:54:54,344
Ain't nothin' but a G thang, baby

2169
01:54:54,427 --> 01:54:56,846
Two loc'ed out niggas so we're crazy

2170
01:54:56,930 --> 01:54:59,641
Death Row is the label that pays me

2171
01:54:59,682 --> 01:55:02,101
Un-fadable so please
don't try and fade this

2172
01:55:02,185 --> 01:55:04,604
But back to the lecture at hand

2173
01:55:04,687 --> 01:55:05,897
Perfection is perfected...

2174
01:55:05,980 --> 01:55:07,607
I want to thank you
for having us here.

2175
01:55:07,690 --> 01:55:10,210
- Of course.
- Very generous for you to give your time

2176
01:55:10,276 --> 01:55:12,612
with everything that's going on right now.

2177
01:55:12,695 --> 01:55:13,988
Not a problem.

2178
01:55:14,030 --> 01:55:15,573
Now if I may,

2179
01:55:16,866 --> 01:55:18,201
are you anti-Semitic?

2180
01:55:19,911 --> 01:55:21,951
Now, I thought
this was about the Rodney King trial.

2181
01:55:22,205 --> 01:55:24,040
Well, the JDL recently got involved

2182
01:55:24,123 --> 01:55:27,001
citing the lyrics about
your former manager Jerry Heller.

2183
01:55:27,043 --> 01:55:30,588
I'm not anti-Semitic.
I'm anti-Jerry Heller.

2184
01:55:30,880 --> 01:55:31,881
Let me ask you something.

2185
01:55:31,965 --> 01:55:35,635
Do the JDL condone Jerry's behavior
when it comes to my situation?

2186
01:55:35,718 --> 01:55:38,471
Him trying to get me to sign a contract
without legal representation?

2187
01:55:39,138 --> 01:55:40,223
I have no idea.

2188
01:55:40,265 --> 01:55:41,724
I didn't think you did.

2189
01:55:41,766 --> 01:55:44,686
But when you got that for me,
we can continue on this topic.

2190
01:55:44,727 --> 01:55:49,899
Until then, I'm here to talk about the
beating of an unarmed motorist, Rodney King.

2191
01:55:49,983 --> 01:55:55,238
And four guilty LAPD officers
who seem to be Daryl Gates' standard issue.

2192
01:55:56,614 --> 01:55:58,741
It's also the LAPD and the FBI

2193
01:55:58,783 --> 01:56:01,828
who feel that your negative portrayal
of police condones violence.

2194
01:56:01,911 --> 01:56:04,831
"Fuck Tha Police" is just a warning,
that's it.

2195
01:56:04,914 --> 01:56:08,251
You can't treat people like that
and expect 'em not to rise up.

2196
01:56:08,585 --> 01:56:10,545
I'm a journalist just like you.

2197
01:56:10,587 --> 01:56:12,505
Reporting what's goin' on in the hood.

2198
01:56:12,589 --> 01:56:15,592
The only thing that's different
is that I'm brutally honest.

2199
01:56:18,052 --> 01:56:20,430
What's your relationship
with the Nation of Islam?

2200
01:56:21,431 --> 01:56:22,932
They my brothers.

2201
01:56:22,974 --> 01:56:25,101
You know what?
That question right there proves to me

2202
01:56:25,143 --> 01:56:27,979
what kind of a unprepared
sandbag reporter you are.

2203
01:56:28,438 --> 01:56:30,273
You talkin' to me
like I'm some elected official.

2204
01:56:30,315 --> 01:56:32,400
Like I'm running for office.

2205
01:56:32,442 --> 01:56:34,319
But I get it, that's your job.

2206
01:56:34,402 --> 01:56:36,821
Bigger the story,
the bigger the check in your field of work.

2207
01:56:37,363 --> 01:56:39,963
It's not your fault, I shouldn't blame you.
What's your name, man?

2208
01:56:41,034 --> 01:56:42,118
Brian.

2209
01:56:42,160 --> 01:56:45,163
Eat a dick, Brian.
Get the fuck out my house. Y'all done here.

2210
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:47,457
Can we cut, please?

2211
01:57:58,903 --> 01:58:01,197
Excuse me, excuse me,
excuse me, excuse me.

2212
01:58:01,239 --> 01:58:02,448
You look like you ready to go.

2213
01:58:02,532 --> 01:58:05,702
Yeah. I'm just waiting on my friend.
I should've drove.

2214
01:58:05,785 --> 01:58:07,036
You're not havin' a good time?

2215
01:58:07,078 --> 01:58:09,289
No! No. I had a really good time,

2216
01:58:09,372 --> 01:58:12,041
but now it's starting to get a little wild.

2217
01:58:12,375 --> 01:58:13,376
Yeah.

2218
01:58:13,459 --> 01:58:15,712
We've been known to get crazy
from time to time.

2219
01:58:17,839 --> 01:58:18,840
I'm Andre.

2220
01:58:19,340 --> 01:58:20,884
I'm Nicole.

2221
01:58:22,594 --> 01:58:24,721
Come on, man. Lighten up.

2222
01:58:26,306 --> 01:58:29,392
We're about to get back in the game.
Big time.

2223
01:58:29,434 --> 01:58:30,852
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

2224
01:58:31,603 --> 01:58:32,604
How do you figure?

2225
01:58:33,605 --> 01:58:37,358
Are you trying to piss me off?
Come on. God almighty.

2226
01:58:37,567 --> 01:58:39,736
Did you forget about Ren's new album?

2227
01:58:39,819 --> 01:58:43,573
Or did you forget about the fact
that you are working on something

2228
01:58:43,615 --> 01:58:46,659
I think is gonna be bigger
than anything N.W.A ever did.

2229
01:58:46,743 --> 01:58:48,411
All I know...

2230
01:58:50,121 --> 01:58:52,165
Fucking Cube out here,

2231
01:58:52,790 --> 01:58:55,793
- doing it big. Making movies and shit.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2232
01:58:55,877 --> 01:58:58,213
Then I keep hearing about
this album Dre about to drop.

2233
01:58:58,254 --> 01:59:01,132
Dre is a fucking producer, Eric.

2234
01:59:01,216 --> 01:59:03,218
Producers don't rap.

2235
01:59:03,259 --> 01:59:06,262
We have him under contract.
He can't do anything.

2236
01:59:06,554 --> 01:59:07,764
Cheer up.

2237
01:59:08,514 --> 01:59:10,516
Eat, drink and be merry.

2238
01:59:10,892 --> 01:59:11,976
- Suge.
- Hey.

2239
01:59:12,060 --> 01:59:13,895
- How you doin'?
- All right.

2240
01:59:13,937 --> 01:59:16,397
Jimmy Iovine, Interscope Records.
Nice to meet you.

2241
01:59:16,439 --> 01:59:17,440
You, too.

2242
01:59:17,523 --> 01:59:20,401
So, what do I call you?
Dre? Dr. Dre? Doc?

2243
01:59:21,611 --> 01:59:23,488
Nah, Dre is cool. Go ahead, have a seat.

2244
01:59:23,571 --> 01:59:24,572
All right.

2245
01:59:24,614 --> 01:59:25,657
- It's good.
- Yeah.

2246
01:59:25,740 --> 01:59:27,075
So what do you got today?

2247
01:59:28,952 --> 01:59:30,411
Well, you know...

2248
01:59:30,453 --> 01:59:34,749
I heard John McClain gave you my album.
What'd you think?

2249
01:59:35,124 --> 01:59:36,334
I think it was great.

2250
01:59:38,545 --> 01:59:41,965
So, you're the artist on the record.
Who produced it?

2251
01:59:43,132 --> 01:59:44,551
I did.

2252
01:59:44,634 --> 01:59:46,553
Okay. And who mixed it?

2253
01:59:46,761 --> 01:59:49,180
Come on, man. I did.

2254
01:59:52,809 --> 01:59:53,810
Listen...

2255
01:59:54,227 --> 01:59:55,812
I don't know anything about hip-hop,

2256
01:59:55,979 --> 01:59:57,981
but I know that this is special.

2257
01:59:58,648 --> 01:59:59,816
Seriously.

2258
02:00:00,817 --> 02:00:01,818
Thank you.

2259
02:00:02,735 --> 02:00:04,695
Hey, look, we'd love
to bring in Interscope,

2260
02:00:05,029 --> 02:00:06,531
but there's a little problem.

2261
02:00:06,906 --> 02:00:07,991
What's the problem?

2262
02:00:08,074 --> 02:00:10,660
Ruthless, lawsuits,

2263
02:00:11,160 --> 02:00:12,453
and contracts.

2264
02:00:13,830 --> 02:00:14,831
How about this?

2265
02:00:15,415 --> 02:00:17,417
You give me three weeks
and I don't wanna hear any bullshit

2266
02:00:17,500 --> 02:00:19,419
about you shopping this
anywhere around town.

2267
02:00:19,794 --> 02:00:21,254
If you do that...

2268
02:00:22,672 --> 02:00:25,425
I believe I can solve your problem
with the contract.

2269
02:00:30,138 --> 02:00:31,681
Lil' nigga, you in my spot.

2270
02:00:32,974 --> 02:00:34,893
- Yo.
- Hey, Suge.

2271
02:00:35,602 --> 02:00:36,895
Suge. Easy, man. Yo.

2272
02:00:36,978 --> 02:00:37,979
Hey, Suge, what the...

2273
02:00:38,104 --> 02:00:39,480
Hey. Suge.

2274
02:00:39,522 --> 02:00:41,024
You parked in my
motherfuckin' spot or what?

2275
02:00:41,107 --> 02:00:42,734
- I didn't know, man.
- It's cool, man.

2276
02:00:43,610 --> 02:00:45,612
What the fuck? Suge!

2277
02:00:48,114 --> 02:00:49,574
Suge, it's just a parking spot.

2278
02:00:49,657 --> 02:00:51,284
Fuck off. Fuck out of my...

2279
02:00:55,538 --> 02:00:56,738
Move this piece of shit.

2280
02:00:59,292 --> 02:01:00,585
And park my car.

2281
02:01:01,794 --> 02:01:04,172
And I better not see
one drop of blood on that motherfucker.

2282
02:01:04,214 --> 02:01:05,840
Suge, let's go, man.

2283
02:01:08,343 --> 02:01:09,344
What?

2284
02:01:12,222 --> 02:01:15,266
The jury in the Rodney King case
has delivered its verdict,

2285
02:01:15,350 --> 02:01:18,102
and not one of the four police officers

2286
02:01:18,186 --> 02:01:20,897
seen on video tape
beating Mr. King a year ago

2287
02:01:20,939 --> 02:01:22,565
is guilty of using excessive force.

2288
02:01:22,649 --> 02:01:24,567
They've all been found not guilty.

2289
02:01:24,609 --> 02:01:27,403
For Christ's sake. Oh, my God.

2290
02:01:27,445 --> 02:01:28,529
Judy, the details.

2291
02:01:28,571 --> 02:01:30,782
Peter, it was a clean sweep
for the defendants.

2292
02:01:30,865 --> 02:01:32,700
Not guilty, the verdict for all of them.

2293
02:01:32,867 --> 02:01:33,952
Only on one count against
Lawrence Powell...

2294
02:01:34,035 --> 02:01:35,036
I'm sorry.

2295
02:01:35,078 --> 02:01:37,198
...on excessive use of force
under color of authority.

2296
02:01:41,626 --> 02:01:43,044
It's probably the worst case

2297
02:01:43,086 --> 02:01:45,171
of police misconduct that I've ever seen.

2298
02:01:46,923 --> 02:01:49,133
I think it was devastating
to the image of this city

2299
02:01:49,217 --> 02:01:50,817
and especially to our police department.

2300
02:01:52,428 --> 02:01:54,628
It looks
kind of like we're in a war zone though.

2301
02:01:55,723 --> 02:01:58,226
We've got some courageous
shop owners here, who are armed...

2302
02:01:58,268 --> 02:02:02,730
Anarchy is obviously
a statement of political dissatisfaction.

2303
02:02:02,897 --> 02:02:04,777
Police officers
are still back down,

2304
02:02:04,941 --> 02:02:07,402
guarding the area
down there with the Ralph's...

2305
02:02:07,443 --> 02:02:09,279
The police
are using eerily reminiscent

2306
02:02:09,320 --> 02:02:11,406
of military-style assault weapons.

2307
02:02:11,447 --> 02:02:13,825
You can hear
random gunshots as rioters...

2308
02:02:13,908 --> 02:02:15,285
The cars
have been left abandoned

2309
02:02:15,368 --> 02:02:17,954
because their drivers came under attack...

2310
02:02:21,124 --> 02:02:23,042
...our city.
We have fires burning.

2311
02:02:24,961 --> 02:02:27,046
Olympic, Pico, Wilshire.

2312
02:02:29,382 --> 02:02:30,800
More than 100 injured,

2313
02:02:30,842 --> 02:02:33,511
mostly in the South-Central
section of Los Angeles.

2314
02:03:07,212 --> 02:03:10,340
You know, If we bag all this shit up in
ounces, we should probably be straight.

2315
02:03:10,423 --> 02:03:12,175
I think we got enough.

2316
02:03:14,344 --> 02:03:16,596
No, turn it down. Turn it down.

2317
02:03:21,392 --> 02:03:24,103
Baby. Can you smoke that shit out there?

2318
02:03:26,522 --> 02:03:29,400
So, all this weed is for
your Ruthless artists?

2319
02:03:29,651 --> 02:03:31,486
Yeah, I mean, shit.

2320
02:03:32,695 --> 02:03:34,697
I'm tryin' to take care
of these little money problems, man.

2321
02:03:34,739 --> 02:03:37,158
So, they can smoke it, sell it.

2322
02:03:37,200 --> 02:03:38,826
Fuck, throw a party on it,
for all I give a fuck.

2323
02:03:38,868 --> 02:03:40,203
As long as I just...

2324
02:03:43,122 --> 02:03:44,322
Yo, man, you straight?

2325
02:03:45,124 --> 02:03:47,043
- E, you straight?
- Yeah, I'm good.

2326
02:03:47,126 --> 02:03:49,126
- No, for real, man. You straight?
- Man, I'm good!

2327
02:03:50,171 --> 02:03:51,422
I'm just fucking tired, man.

2328
02:03:51,506 --> 02:03:54,217
I'm fucking downgrading houses.
How would you feel?

2329
02:03:54,509 --> 02:03:55,802
Answer me that!

2330
02:03:55,885 --> 02:03:58,012
Dre rolled out. Ruthless money low.

2331
02:03:58,054 --> 02:04:00,431
Tomica asking me all kind of questions
about the house.

2332
02:04:01,057 --> 02:04:03,810
Answer me this, would you be all right?

2333
02:04:04,185 --> 02:04:06,521
Would you be all right
moving out your fucking house?

2334
02:04:06,563 --> 02:04:07,730
You all right with it?

2335
02:04:07,814 --> 02:04:11,025
E, I'm your boy. I'm in this shit with you.

2336
02:04:11,067 --> 02:04:12,694
I'm just trying to make
sure you're good, bro.

2337
02:04:12,735 --> 02:04:14,571
I'm good! You good?

2338
02:04:14,654 --> 02:04:15,974
- You good?
- Yeah, man.

2339
02:04:16,364 --> 02:04:17,490
Eric.

2340
02:04:17,574 --> 02:04:18,616
What, Jerry?

2341
02:04:18,700 --> 02:04:19,951
Take it easy.

2342
02:04:20,034 --> 02:04:21,995
You know what?
Let's get you outta the house.

2343
02:04:22,078 --> 02:04:24,122
I have stuff needs your autograph, okay?

2344
02:04:25,373 --> 02:04:26,958
I'll come when I have time, Jerry.

2345
02:04:27,041 --> 02:04:28,751
Eric, come on.

2346
02:04:31,212 --> 02:04:32,589
We still got a business to run.

2347
02:04:32,672 --> 02:04:34,299
Don't it look like
I'm running business right now?

2348
02:04:34,382 --> 02:04:36,092
No. It looks like
you're fucking cutting up weed.

2349
02:04:36,134 --> 02:04:39,596
I thought that was a job
for fucking jackasses.

2350
02:04:41,890 --> 02:04:43,516
You know what, Jerry?

2351
02:04:45,059 --> 02:04:48,771
You right. You absolutely fuckin' right.

2352
02:04:49,731 --> 02:04:51,858
We got business to take care of.

2353
02:04:52,901 --> 02:04:54,944
I'll see you in a minute.

2354
02:05:04,245 --> 02:05:05,872
You all right, E?

2355
02:05:06,789 --> 02:05:08,291
E, are you cool?

2356
02:05:10,793 --> 02:05:12,545
Eric.

2357
02:05:19,135 --> 02:05:23,348
"You got knocked the fuck out."

2358
02:05:26,476 --> 02:05:27,894
That shit's funny.

2359
02:05:27,977 --> 02:05:29,270
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, baby.

2360
02:05:29,312 --> 02:05:30,897
How's Friday coming?

2361
02:05:30,980 --> 02:05:34,317
This shit is funny. I'm feeling it, though.

2362
02:05:35,276 --> 02:05:36,486
What page are you on?

2363
02:05:36,653 --> 02:05:39,989
100. I'm not going too much longer, though.

2364
02:05:40,073 --> 02:05:41,407
Baby, come here. Look!

2365
02:05:44,160 --> 02:05:46,162
Look how young y'all are.

2366
02:05:49,666 --> 02:05:50,667
Shit.

2367
02:05:53,044 --> 02:05:54,379
Dang!

2368
02:05:54,837 --> 02:05:56,089
What?

2369
02:05:56,839 --> 02:05:59,259
We left a lot of good records on the table.

2370
02:06:35,253 --> 02:06:37,964
It's like
I don't even know what I'm doing no more.

2371
02:06:38,840 --> 02:06:40,717
I don't know where the money going.

2372
02:06:40,925 --> 02:06:42,552
Why you stressin'?

2373
02:06:42,635 --> 02:06:44,554
You know I know the business.

2374
02:06:45,179 --> 02:06:46,890
Just... Shit.

2375
02:06:46,973 --> 02:06:49,684
Lay out all the files,
contracts, whatever it is,

2376
02:06:49,726 --> 02:06:51,603
and I'll look into it.

2377
02:06:52,186 --> 02:06:54,397
For real. Come here.

2378
02:06:56,566 --> 02:06:58,234
Come here.

2379
02:07:04,908 --> 02:07:07,452
You just go to New York,

2380
02:07:07,535 --> 02:07:12,332
you take care of this
big ol' distribution deal with Sony.

2381
02:07:12,415 --> 02:07:14,375
Bring that shit on in.

2382
02:07:15,460 --> 02:07:19,088
All right?
And I'll check into everything else.

2383
02:07:23,593 --> 02:07:24,761
I love you.

2384
02:07:24,802 --> 02:07:25,803
You what?

2385
02:07:26,262 --> 02:07:27,430
I love you.

2386
02:07:27,472 --> 02:07:30,099
You what? I can't hear you.

2387
02:07:33,061 --> 02:07:35,271
So how's your home life, man?

2388
02:07:36,189 --> 02:07:38,816
What? That small-ass house
I just moved into in Norwalk?

2389
02:07:38,900 --> 02:07:40,193
Fuckin' hate it.

2390
02:07:40,276 --> 02:07:42,737
No, come on. You know what I mean.

2391
02:07:42,779 --> 02:07:45,698
I mean your love life, Eric.

2392
02:07:46,866 --> 02:07:49,536
You seem pretty serious about this girl.

2393
02:07:49,619 --> 02:07:53,414
- I ain't in love.
- Oh? You had me scared there for a minute.

2394
02:07:53,456 --> 02:07:55,542
You're too young to settle down.

2395
02:07:55,625 --> 02:07:57,210
Well, you don't have to be scared of that.

2396
02:07:57,293 --> 02:07:59,462
Oh, man. Wait till you taste this.

2397
02:07:59,546 --> 02:08:01,798
Kung Pao chicken.

2398
02:08:01,839 --> 02:08:03,299
Fantastic.

2399
02:08:03,383 --> 02:08:05,802
And it is better the second day.

2400
02:08:06,261 --> 02:08:07,804
There you go.

2401
02:08:08,221 --> 02:08:09,222
Dig in.

2402
02:08:12,517 --> 02:08:15,311
So, where is this girl from again?

2403
02:08:17,772 --> 02:08:19,649
Look, Jerry.

2404
02:08:19,691 --> 02:08:21,484
I actually ate right before I came.

2405
02:08:21,526 --> 02:08:24,112
So I'm just gonna take this and go.

2406
02:08:24,237 --> 02:08:26,990
Hold on. Hold on. Where are you going?

2407
02:08:27,031 --> 02:08:28,825
I just came to get this.

2408
02:08:29,242 --> 02:08:30,785
These are my bills, my checks.

2409
02:08:30,827 --> 02:08:33,496
Look, I'm gonna have a bite of your food.

2410
02:08:35,081 --> 02:08:37,041
I'm gonna say farewell.

2411
02:08:40,086 --> 02:08:42,714
I'll talk to you later.

2412
02:08:52,223 --> 02:08:54,684
Your neighbors,
they've been complaining a lot.

2413
02:08:54,767 --> 02:08:55,810
The noise.

2414
02:08:55,852 --> 02:08:57,687
Stop.

2415
02:08:58,354 --> 02:09:00,690
I just think a little
privacy would be better.

2416
02:09:02,358 --> 02:09:04,444
So what? You want me to move?

2417
02:09:05,361 --> 02:09:06,362
Yeah.

2418
02:09:07,363 --> 02:09:10,241
And I...
You know, I happen to know of a place.

2419
02:09:10,325 --> 02:09:12,869
There's plenty of room,
and I know the owner.

2420
02:09:14,787 --> 02:09:16,873
Are you sure you're ready for that, Andre?

2421
02:09:16,915 --> 02:09:18,333
Yeah, I am.

2422
02:09:19,209 --> 02:09:21,920
'Cause I'm really feeling you like that.

2423
02:09:24,088 --> 02:09:26,549
I'm really feeling you too.

2424
02:09:27,717 --> 02:09:28,885
But...

2425
02:09:35,099 --> 02:09:38,728
Hey, don't even worry about it.
It was just a thought.

2426
02:09:42,899 --> 02:09:43,983
What's up?

2427
02:09:44,567 --> 02:09:47,695
All right. Good night.

2428
02:09:47,737 --> 02:09:50,490
Really? Good night?

2429
02:09:51,074 --> 02:09:52,158
You okay to drive?

2430
02:09:54,160 --> 02:09:55,828
No. Look at you.

2431
02:09:56,996 --> 02:09:58,081
Good night, Andre.

2432
02:09:58,164 --> 02:09:59,666
Nah. See...

2433
02:10:00,333 --> 02:10:01,459
See, I can't help thinking,

2434
02:10:01,543 --> 02:10:04,045
maybe you want me to come inside.

2435
02:10:04,087 --> 02:10:05,380
Of course I do.

2436
02:10:05,421 --> 02:10:06,839
So, what's different now?

2437
02:10:08,216 --> 02:10:10,760
I got a lot to think about.

2438
02:10:10,843 --> 02:10:12,971
You're asking me to move in with you.

2439
02:10:13,054 --> 02:10:14,764
That is a huge step!

2440
02:10:15,682 --> 02:10:16,683
I like you, Andre,

2441
02:10:16,766 --> 02:10:19,269
but there's a lot going on around you.

2442
02:10:20,186 --> 02:10:21,771
Whatchu mean?

2443
02:10:22,605 --> 02:10:25,650
I know about the whole Death Row business,

2444
02:10:25,733 --> 02:10:26,901
the assault charges,

2445
02:10:26,943 --> 02:10:28,528
the shooting.

2446
02:10:28,611 --> 02:10:30,947
Just seems dangerous.

2447
02:10:31,030 --> 02:10:33,700
My son is my world.

2448
02:10:37,620 --> 02:10:39,289
I hear you.

2449
02:10:45,628 --> 02:10:47,046
Good night.

2450
02:11:05,106 --> 02:11:07,650
Hail Mary, run quick see

2451
02:11:07,692 --> 02:11:10,153
What do we have here now?

2452
02:11:10,194 --> 02:11:12,030
Do you wanna ride or die?

2453
02:11:14,991 --> 02:11:17,035
I ain't a killer but don't push me

2454
02:11:17,118 --> 02:11:19,829
Revenge is like
the sweetest joy next to getting pussy

2455
02:11:19,871 --> 02:11:23,333
Picture paragraphs unloaded
Wise words being quoted

2456
02:11:23,374 --> 02:11:25,627
Peeped the weakness
in the rap game and sewed it

2457
02:11:25,710 --> 02:11:28,671
Bow down, pray to God
Hoping that he's listening

2458
02:11:28,755 --> 02:11:31,174
Seeing niggas coming for me
and my diamonds...

2459
02:11:32,842 --> 02:11:34,042
What up, Dre?

2460
02:11:34,427 --> 02:11:35,428
What up, Pac?

2461
02:11:35,595 --> 02:11:37,680
I'm about to bust niggas in the mouth
with this new album.

2462
02:11:37,764 --> 02:11:39,515
Okay, I feel that.

2463
02:11:39,641 --> 02:11:42,018
- Suge said you got some heat for a nigga.
- Hell yeah!

2464
02:11:42,101 --> 02:11:43,770
- Play that for him.
- Okay.

2465
02:11:44,687 --> 02:11:46,814
California Love

2466
02:11:53,029 --> 02:11:54,614
Yeah. You feel that?

2467
02:11:55,448 --> 02:11:56,741
Yeah. Fuck with me.

2468
02:11:56,824 --> 02:11:57,825
California...

2469
02:11:57,867 --> 02:11:59,619
- "California Love."
- Yeah.

2470
02:11:59,702 --> 02:12:02,163
...knows how to party

2471
02:12:02,205 --> 02:12:03,373
California...

2472
02:12:04,666 --> 02:12:06,668
...knows how to party

2473
02:12:07,710 --> 02:12:09,546
What the hell was that?

2474
02:12:09,629 --> 02:12:10,630
Hold on, Pac.

2475
02:12:11,214 --> 02:12:12,882
Stay right there, man.

2476
02:12:15,802 --> 02:12:17,387
Yo. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

2477
02:12:19,347 --> 02:12:21,474
- Come on.
- Come on, man.

2478
02:12:21,558 --> 02:12:24,519
Shut the fuck up
and put your glasses down.

2479
02:12:25,895 --> 02:12:27,355
Stop, man! Stop.

2480
02:12:29,065 --> 02:12:30,233
Chop, chop.

2481
02:12:30,817 --> 02:12:31,818
Get him. Get hype.

2482
02:12:32,151 --> 02:12:33,152
Get hype.

2483
02:12:34,070 --> 02:12:35,071
Yo!

2484
02:12:36,906 --> 02:12:38,867
What the fuck are y'all doing?

2485
02:12:40,034 --> 02:12:41,035
Check this out.

2486
02:12:41,452 --> 02:12:43,663
Get him. Time to eat. Who's hungry?

2487
02:12:43,746 --> 02:12:45,164
You hungry, nigga? Yeah!

2488
02:12:45,248 --> 02:12:46,666
- Get up.
- Come on!

2489
02:12:48,418 --> 02:12:50,178
Bring your bitch-ass up.

2490
02:12:51,254 --> 02:12:52,694
Tight-whitey ass nigga.

2491
02:12:54,591 --> 02:12:56,092
You know what to do.

2492
02:13:00,763 --> 02:13:01,890
I'd like to make a toast.

2493
02:13:02,265 --> 02:13:03,266
To what?

2494
02:13:03,433 --> 02:13:04,601
To Death Row Records...

2495
02:13:05,184 --> 02:13:06,269
Death Row!

2496
02:13:06,352 --> 02:13:07,604
...and Suge

2497
02:13:07,854 --> 02:13:09,397
for making all this happen.

2498
02:13:12,191 --> 02:13:14,694
And may the West Coast reign forever.

2499
02:13:15,445 --> 02:13:16,779
Come on. Come on.

2500
02:13:18,364 --> 02:13:20,450
And may the West Coast reign forever.

2501
02:13:21,242 --> 02:13:23,077
Now toast to Dr. Dre.

2502
02:13:23,620 --> 02:13:24,954
Put your glass down.

2503
02:13:26,789 --> 02:13:28,708
I said, put the fucking glasses down!

2504
02:13:28,791 --> 02:13:30,084
Hey, yo, slow your roll, Dre.

2505
02:13:30,251 --> 02:13:31,377
Come on.

2506
02:13:31,461 --> 02:13:32,712
This why we got money?

2507
02:13:33,796 --> 02:13:35,590
To act like we ain't got no goddamn sense?

2508
02:13:35,632 --> 02:13:37,091
We coulda did all this dumb shit

2509
02:13:37,133 --> 02:13:38,468
back in Compton!

2510
02:13:39,135 --> 02:13:41,387
But this what the fuck y'all turned into.

2511
02:13:41,471 --> 02:13:42,972
You sittin' up here eatin' fuckin' crab.

2512
02:13:43,056 --> 02:13:45,058
Who the fuck are you?

2513
02:13:46,893 --> 02:13:50,313
This my motherfucking name
on the wall, man!

2514
02:13:51,814 --> 02:13:54,984
And y'all in here acting like
y'all on motherfucking vacation.

2515
02:13:55,068 --> 02:13:57,946
I got Pac in the next motherfucking room.

2516
02:13:57,987 --> 02:14:00,240
Grindin', man! Workin'!

2517
02:14:01,115 --> 02:14:03,618
And y'all niggas in here partyin'?

2518
02:14:05,245 --> 02:14:06,829
One time?

2519
02:14:13,378 --> 02:14:14,858
- You trippin'.
- That's right.

2520
02:14:15,547 --> 02:14:17,090
We can do anything we wanna do.

2521
02:14:17,674 --> 02:14:19,717
We started this thing. This is us.

2522
02:14:19,801 --> 02:14:21,844
Nah, nigga. Death Row, that's us.

2523
02:14:23,429 --> 02:14:25,765
I don't know what the fuck this shit is.

2524
02:14:26,766 --> 02:14:28,726
Better watch your mouth, Blood.

2525
02:14:28,810 --> 02:14:30,812
And who the fuck you talking to, huh?

2526
02:14:30,979 --> 02:14:32,313
Nigga, you ain't nothing but a producer.

2527
02:14:32,480 --> 02:14:34,065
Get the fuck out my face!

2528
02:14:43,366 --> 02:14:44,492
Shit!

2529
02:14:45,785 --> 02:14:46,786
Dre.

2530
02:14:48,913 --> 02:14:50,707
This is bullshit.

2531
02:14:50,790 --> 02:14:51,791
Dre!

2532
02:15:08,725 --> 02:15:11,227
Always fucking with me!

2533
02:15:37,212 --> 02:15:38,963
Stop the vehicle now.

2534
02:15:43,259 --> 02:15:45,386
Driver, hold it right there.

2535
02:15:46,054 --> 02:15:48,097
Turn your vehicle off.

2536
02:15:48,139 --> 02:15:50,266
Drop the keys out of the window!

2537
02:15:50,975 --> 02:15:52,018
Open the door.

2538
02:15:54,062 --> 02:15:57,607
Step out of the vehicle. Hands in the air.

2539
02:15:58,566 --> 02:16:00,693
Keep them up! Hold it there.

2540
02:16:02,779 --> 02:16:04,739
Turn around.

2541
02:16:04,781 --> 02:16:07,158
Turn around. Fingers behind your head.

2542
02:16:07,367 --> 02:16:08,607
Hold it right there.

2543
02:16:18,169 --> 02:16:19,420
Hey, that's Eazy.

2544
02:16:21,631 --> 02:16:24,300
Wazzup, E! I didn't know that was you.

2545
02:16:25,593 --> 02:16:27,833
- Hey, wassup? Wassup, homie?
- Hey. Yo, wuddup?

2546
02:16:30,348 --> 02:16:31,474
Nah. Hold up.

2547
02:16:31,558 --> 02:16:34,143
Hey, hey. Hold up. Relax, homie.
We in a club.

2548
02:16:35,311 --> 02:16:37,272
Cube, I just heard you was over here.

2549
02:16:48,032 --> 02:16:50,743
Yeah, I'm here. Whatchu need?

2550
02:16:53,371 --> 02:16:56,499
Everybody to calm the fuck down
from the looks of it.

2551
02:16:57,500 --> 02:16:59,127
I mean, I was just in
the neighborhood, man.

2552
02:16:59,168 --> 02:17:00,503
I came here with Bone Thugs.

2553
02:17:00,545 --> 02:17:02,422
I was just coming to say wassup.

2554
02:17:03,381 --> 02:17:04,382
Wassup?

2555
02:17:05,717 --> 02:17:08,803
I saw Boyz in the Hood. It was good.

2556
02:17:10,263 --> 02:17:12,974
You ain't called that shit
a after school special?

2557
02:17:15,727 --> 02:17:19,188
I like after school specials, Cube.
You know that.

2558
02:17:26,779 --> 02:17:28,364
What's up, man?

2559
02:17:28,448 --> 02:17:30,658
How you feel? You good?

2560
02:17:30,700 --> 02:17:32,535
Hell yeah, nigga, I'm good.

2561
02:17:32,577 --> 02:17:34,329
It's good to see you.

2562
02:17:34,370 --> 02:17:35,872
It's good to see you right now.

2563
02:17:35,955 --> 02:17:37,707
Look at you!

2564
02:17:37,749 --> 02:17:39,209
Pull your fuckin' homies off me then

2565
02:17:39,250 --> 02:17:40,376
if it's good to see me.

2566
02:17:40,418 --> 02:17:42,003
You had niggas jump us.

2567
02:17:42,170 --> 02:17:43,338
God damn!

2568
02:17:44,797 --> 02:17:46,637
How you go from selling rocks
in the dope house

2569
02:17:46,716 --> 02:17:49,886
to having dinner
in the White House with the President?

2570
02:17:49,928 --> 02:17:53,348
They still trying to figure that shit out.

2571
02:17:53,389 --> 02:17:55,892
But, hey, all publicity...

2572
02:17:55,934 --> 02:17:57,560
...is good publicity.

2573
02:17:57,644 --> 02:17:59,020
You know it.

2574
02:17:59,062 --> 02:18:00,146
You know that's right.

2575
02:18:00,230 --> 02:18:01,522
Man.

2576
02:18:02,065 --> 02:18:05,109
Look, man, I wish that dumb shit

2577
02:18:05,193 --> 02:18:06,913
really would've never
popped off between us.

2578
02:18:06,945 --> 02:18:09,197
We shouldn't have
dissed each other in the first place.

2579
02:18:09,239 --> 02:18:11,366
Making the fans choose between us?

2580
02:18:11,407 --> 02:18:12,575
That wasn't cool.

2581
02:18:13,535 --> 02:18:14,661
You right.

2582
02:18:17,080 --> 02:18:18,915
You ever think we'd be that big, though?

2583
02:18:18,998 --> 02:18:20,250
Hell, no.

2584
02:18:20,333 --> 02:18:22,210
I was just talking to my wife about that.

2585
02:18:22,252 --> 02:18:24,087
How it was in the beginning.

2586
02:18:24,128 --> 02:18:26,631
Shit, we just wanted to do music
for the neighborhood.

2587
02:18:26,714 --> 02:18:28,174
Be ghetto stars.

2588
02:18:28,883 --> 02:18:30,927
But what if we had the chance

2589
02:18:30,969 --> 02:18:34,222
to find out how big we can really be?

2590
02:18:34,264 --> 02:18:36,599
Come on, man. You got my mind workin'.

2591
02:18:36,641 --> 02:18:39,185
I've been thinking
about that shit all the time.

2592
02:18:39,269 --> 02:18:42,188
If we could just take that shit
back to '89. We changed the world!

2593
02:18:42,480 --> 02:18:45,149
I hear you.
It was a simpler time, you know?

2594
02:18:45,233 --> 02:18:46,943
It was hard then.

2595
02:18:47,026 --> 02:18:48,069
But I've had days

2596
02:18:48,111 --> 02:18:50,947
where I almost wish
we was gettin' arrested in Detroit again.

2597
02:18:50,989 --> 02:18:52,615
Shit. You know?

2598
02:18:52,824 --> 02:18:54,450
Shit ain't gotta stop there.

2599
02:18:55,076 --> 02:18:56,661
But if we go do this,

2600
02:18:57,829 --> 02:18:59,539
we gotta do it right.

2601
02:18:59,622 --> 02:19:01,875
And if Dre with it, I'm with it.

2602
02:19:02,125 --> 02:19:04,586
But I don't know your
relationship with dude.

2603
02:19:05,545 --> 02:19:08,464
But if you want me, Eric,
Jerry can't be there.

2604
02:19:13,177 --> 02:19:14,220
All right.

2605
02:19:16,222 --> 02:19:17,223
Hey, man.

2606
02:19:18,600 --> 02:19:19,601
Shit!

2607
02:19:19,893 --> 02:19:21,519
It's 'cause you
ain't got them damn gloves on.

2608
02:19:21,603 --> 02:19:22,812
Man, whatever.

2609
02:19:24,397 --> 02:19:26,107
But I hear you.

2610
02:19:26,566 --> 02:19:27,609
Yeah?

2611
02:19:28,484 --> 02:19:30,820
Shit. Ar'ight.

2612
02:19:32,030 --> 02:19:34,574
These invoices haven't been paid.

2613
02:19:34,657 --> 02:19:37,035
They're two or three years outdated.

2614
02:19:37,118 --> 02:19:39,829
These are cancelled checks.
They all bounced.

2615
02:19:39,913 --> 02:19:42,123
And these are past due.

2616
02:19:42,165 --> 02:19:44,125
Jerry took advantage of you.

2617
02:19:45,793 --> 02:19:47,420
I know it's a lot,

2618
02:19:47,503 --> 02:19:50,215
but you had to know the truth sometime.

2619
02:19:50,298 --> 02:19:51,716
Now you do.

2620
02:19:53,843 --> 02:19:56,512
You know Dre and Cube
tried to warn me about this.

2621
02:19:59,182 --> 02:20:01,684
I've been fuckin' up for a long time.

2622
02:20:06,189 --> 02:20:07,565
Don't. Don't.

2623
02:20:07,649 --> 02:20:09,651
Real long time.

2624
02:20:13,696 --> 02:20:14,864
Shit.

2625
02:20:32,674 --> 02:20:33,883
Hey, man.

2626
02:20:37,887 --> 02:20:41,307
Where you been?
I've been calling you all day.

2627
02:20:43,685 --> 02:20:45,770
Sit down, Jerry.

2628
02:20:49,566 --> 02:20:52,151
What is this all about? The groupie?

2629
02:20:52,735 --> 02:20:54,779
The executive assistant?

2630
02:20:56,239 --> 02:20:58,366
She even go to college?

2631
02:20:58,408 --> 02:21:01,411
Man, you're so much fuckin'
smarter than this.

2632
02:21:01,452 --> 02:21:03,121
Sit down, Jerry.

2633
02:21:24,350 --> 02:21:26,269
This ain't about Tomica, Jerry.

2634
02:21:27,520 --> 02:21:28,855
It's about you.

2635
02:21:28,938 --> 02:21:31,065
And you can stop acting
like you ain't never done nothing wrong.

2636
02:21:31,107 --> 02:21:34,360
You know what, man?
I know that you're upset. I understand.

2637
02:21:36,112 --> 02:21:40,283
But I'm asking you,
I'm advising you, take a breath, okay?

2638
02:21:40,366 --> 02:21:41,951
I'm gonna look at the paperwork, Eric.

2639
02:21:42,035 --> 02:21:45,538
- You can stop giving me advice as of now.
- It's fucked up.

2640
02:21:47,207 --> 02:21:48,458
Here's what's about to happen.

2641
02:21:48,541 --> 02:21:50,543
I'mma get N.W.A back together,

2642
02:21:51,127 --> 02:21:53,463
and you ain't gonna have
nothing to do with it this time.

2643
02:21:55,590 --> 02:21:57,467
How the fuck can you even say
something like that?

2644
02:21:57,550 --> 02:22:00,011
What the fuck is going on with you, man?

2645
02:22:00,845 --> 02:22:02,513
I know what's good for you,

2646
02:22:02,597 --> 02:22:04,515
I know what's good for Ruthless...

2647
02:22:04,599 --> 02:22:08,436
And we have worked up a trust
after years of hard work,

2648
02:22:08,478 --> 02:22:10,271
and that trust is our foundation, Eric.

2649
02:22:10,313 --> 02:22:11,673
I don't give a shit.

2650
02:22:12,315 --> 02:22:13,608
Eric?

2651
02:22:16,444 --> 02:22:19,030
You look lousy, man. Are you okay?

2652
02:22:20,531 --> 02:22:21,699
Trust?

2653
02:22:22,825 --> 02:22:24,786
Trust is a motherfucker.

2654
02:22:26,204 --> 02:22:27,914
Is it?

2655
02:22:27,997 --> 02:22:29,624
Let me ask you something.

2656
02:22:30,625 --> 02:22:33,002
Eric, if what I'm doing is so illegal,

2657
02:22:33,086 --> 02:22:34,286
how come I've never been sued?

2658
02:22:35,296 --> 02:22:36,839
If I'm such a fuckin' thief,

2659
02:22:36,881 --> 02:22:39,008
such a liar, such a motherfucker,

2660
02:22:39,050 --> 02:22:41,302
how come nobody's ever come to collect?

2661
02:22:41,344 --> 02:22:45,139
Because this is business
and this is how it works.

2662
02:22:45,181 --> 02:22:47,517
And it's not always pretty. No.

2663
02:22:47,559 --> 02:22:48,893
Do I cover my own ass?

2664
02:22:48,977 --> 02:22:51,229
Do I cover my own end? Absolutely.

2665
02:22:51,312 --> 02:22:53,356
But don't you dare fuckin' tell me

2666
02:22:53,439 --> 02:22:54,816
that I have not taken care of you.

2667
02:22:55,400 --> 02:22:59,988
Don't you fuckin' tell me
that I have not had your back from day one!

2668
02:23:00,029 --> 02:23:01,698
Day one!

2669
02:23:06,286 --> 02:23:08,121
Is this taking care of me?

2670
02:23:08,997 --> 02:23:10,498
Are you fucking kidding me?

2671
02:23:10,540 --> 02:23:12,260
It's taking care of the
whole fucking thing.

2672
02:23:12,292 --> 02:23:14,002
It's business!

2673
02:23:14,043 --> 02:23:15,420
And this is how it works.

2674
02:23:15,545 --> 02:23:18,840
Have I covered my end?
Do I cover my ass? Absolutely.

2675
02:23:18,882 --> 02:23:20,800
But don't you dare fuckin' tell me

2676
02:23:20,884 --> 02:23:22,760
that I have not taken care of you.

2677
02:23:25,263 --> 02:23:27,098
This business, too?

2678
02:23:27,181 --> 02:23:28,391
Yes! This is business.

2679
02:23:28,474 --> 02:23:30,226
This is how fucked up it can get.

2680
02:23:30,310 --> 02:23:33,521
But I didn't start this.
I didn't fuck it up.

2681
02:23:33,563 --> 02:23:34,856
You did!

2682
02:23:36,691 --> 02:23:37,775
No.

2683
02:23:39,861 --> 02:23:41,112
You did.

2684
02:23:43,031 --> 02:23:44,532
You fired, Jerry.

2685
02:23:44,657 --> 02:23:46,075
Oh, for Christ...

2686
02:23:46,159 --> 02:23:47,911
Eric, this is not how we do things.

2687
02:23:47,952 --> 02:23:49,287
This is not you.

2688
02:23:49,370 --> 02:23:50,747
This is not you.

2689
02:23:50,830 --> 02:23:51,831
Eric!

2690
02:23:53,208 --> 02:23:54,751
This is an important company.

2691
02:23:54,834 --> 02:23:57,086
Eric, I'm not gonna let you fuck this up.

2692
02:23:57,754 --> 02:23:58,796
Eric?

2693
02:23:59,881 --> 02:24:01,007
Oh, for Christ's sake!

2694
02:24:01,090 --> 02:24:02,508
Eric!

2695
02:24:14,270 --> 02:24:15,813
Yeah, hello?

2696
02:24:15,939 --> 02:24:17,690
Wuddup, Dre?

2697
02:24:17,774 --> 02:24:19,651
- Who this?
- Eric.

2698
02:24:19,943 --> 02:24:21,194
E?

2699
02:24:21,444 --> 02:24:22,445
Just felt like calling.

2700
02:24:22,946 --> 02:24:24,781
Yeah. Okay.

2701
02:24:26,282 --> 02:24:27,450
What's up?

2702
02:24:27,492 --> 02:24:29,911
I mean, you know me, man. Doing my thing.

2703
02:24:30,453 --> 02:24:32,288
Killin' all this pussy.

2704
02:24:33,540 --> 02:24:34,624
How about you?

2705
02:24:34,666 --> 02:24:35,917
You know, man.

2706
02:24:35,959 --> 02:24:38,127
I'm just making tracks. Doing my thing.

2707
02:24:38,169 --> 02:24:41,339
Yeah, that Snoop joint you did was crazy.
That was dope.

2708
02:24:41,422 --> 02:24:44,926
Yeah? Thanks, E. Good looking out, man.

2709
02:24:49,973 --> 02:24:51,641
Look, Dre, I know you be busy,

2710
02:24:53,851 --> 02:24:55,144
but I talked to Cube and we were talking

2711
02:24:55,186 --> 02:24:58,356
about some possibilities.

2712
02:24:59,816 --> 02:25:02,193
Possibilities? Okay.

2713
02:25:02,318 --> 02:25:03,319
Yeah, like,

2714
02:25:03,403 --> 02:25:05,989
without Jerry Heller
type of fucking possibilities.

2715
02:25:06,072 --> 02:25:07,073
Really?

2716
02:25:07,699 --> 02:25:08,783
Well, it's about time.

2717
02:25:08,825 --> 02:25:11,828
Man, I mean, I know shit kinda went crazy.

2718
02:25:13,246 --> 02:25:17,959
You know, the money
kinda had everybody divided, man,

2719
02:25:18,501 --> 02:25:20,378
but I really wish it didn't.

2720
02:25:27,135 --> 02:25:30,680
To be honest, man,
I'm not proud of all the shit I did either.

2721
02:25:36,311 --> 02:25:37,437
So, whatchu think, man?

2722
02:25:37,520 --> 02:25:40,356
You think we could get together or what?
Whatchu think?

2723
02:25:44,652 --> 02:25:45,904
Yeah, man.

2724
02:25:47,071 --> 02:25:49,198
Yeah, that sound good.

2725
02:25:50,158 --> 02:25:52,202
Let's do it, E. Let's do it.

2726
02:25:52,493 --> 02:25:55,330
I'mma let you know when we can get back
into the studio, you know?

2727
02:25:55,371 --> 02:25:59,083
Lay down some tracks like the old days.

2728
02:26:00,793 --> 02:26:02,337
Fair enough.

2729
02:26:02,378 --> 02:26:03,379
A'ight.

2730
02:26:04,005 --> 02:26:05,673
It's good to hear from you, man.

2731
02:26:08,092 --> 02:26:09,344
A'ight.

2732
02:26:40,333 --> 02:26:42,710
Man, y'all niggas
ain't making no music in here.

2733
02:26:42,752 --> 02:26:43,920
Hey!

2734
02:26:43,962 --> 02:26:45,088
'Sup, E?

2735
02:26:45,129 --> 02:26:46,589
What up? What up? What up?

2736
02:26:46,631 --> 02:26:49,759
Yo, hey, when are Dre and Cube
gonna roll up in here, man?

2737
02:26:49,801 --> 02:26:51,094
- Yeah, man.
- I'm ready!

2738
02:26:51,135 --> 02:26:52,595
'Cause I'm ready
to get this new shit going.

2739
02:26:52,637 --> 02:26:53,805
I'm ready, too.

2740
02:26:53,888 --> 02:26:55,098
But long as we stay ready,

2741
02:26:55,181 --> 02:26:56,766
we gonna know we go beyond, man.

2742
02:26:56,849 --> 02:26:59,769
You already know
this new N.W.A shit about to be crazy.

2743
02:26:59,811 --> 02:27:01,062
Here ya go, baby.

2744
02:27:01,104 --> 02:27:03,731
E, I got books of new shit.
I got libraries of new shit.

2745
02:27:03,773 --> 02:27:04,899
That's what I'm talking about, Ren.

2746
02:27:04,941 --> 02:27:06,141
That's what I'm talking about.

2747
02:27:07,360 --> 02:27:10,613
I got the tracks. You like that?

2748
02:27:11,864 --> 02:27:15,869
Hell yeah.
'Chu think you Dre now?

2749
02:27:16,160 --> 02:27:17,745
I'm trying to murder Dre.

2750
02:27:17,787 --> 02:27:20,748
I'm about to murder both of y'all
on the track, though. Check me out.

2751
02:27:20,790 --> 02:27:21,958
Check me out.

2752
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:25,003
What you doing, E?
You know you don't play no instruments.

2753
02:27:28,381 --> 02:27:30,216
You gonna play it?

2754
02:27:32,510 --> 02:27:33,803
E, you all right?

2755
02:27:35,013 --> 02:27:36,180
Eric.

2756
02:27:37,473 --> 02:27:38,975
Baby, you good?

2757
02:27:40,268 --> 02:27:43,104
Yeah. I'm all right.

2758
02:27:47,817 --> 02:27:49,944
- Eric! Eric!
- Call 911.

2759
02:27:49,986 --> 02:27:51,529
- Eric! Baby?
- Eric. Get up, man.

2760
02:27:51,613 --> 02:27:54,115
- Get him up.
- Yo, call 911. Call 911.

2761
02:27:54,157 --> 02:27:56,534
- You all right, E?
- Baby? Eric?

2762
02:27:56,701 --> 02:27:58,870
- Eazy, wake up.
- Eric! Baby.

2763
02:27:58,953 --> 02:28:00,163
Open your eyes.

2764
02:28:00,246 --> 02:28:01,686
Yes, we need an ambulance.

2765
02:28:16,679 --> 02:28:19,515
Wait... Ain't you gonna say something?

2766
02:28:20,225 --> 02:28:22,352
What is it? A respiratory infection?

2767
02:28:22,435 --> 02:28:23,561
Pneumonia? What?

2768
02:28:23,645 --> 02:28:26,189
Yes, well, um, it is those things,

2769
02:28:26,231 --> 02:28:27,857
and more, I'm afraid.

2770
02:28:27,899 --> 02:28:30,777
We ran a full blood battery, and, uh...

2771
02:28:32,570 --> 02:28:36,866
I'm sorry, Mr. Wright,
but you've tested positive for HIV.

2772
02:28:38,785 --> 02:28:40,078
Get the fuck outta here.

2773
02:28:40,161 --> 02:28:41,204
What?

2774
02:28:41,287 --> 02:28:42,705
A normal T-cell count

2775
02:28:42,747 --> 02:28:45,208
is anywhere between 500 and 1,500.

2776
02:28:45,250 --> 02:28:47,293
Right now, your T-cell count is 14.

2777
02:28:52,340 --> 02:28:53,841
But I ain't no faggot.

2778
02:28:53,883 --> 02:28:55,051
Mr. Wright, actually,

2779
02:28:55,134 --> 02:28:57,679
the virus can be transmitted
in quite a few ways,

2780
02:28:57,720 --> 02:29:00,848
including unprotected heterosexual sex.

2781
02:29:06,229 --> 02:29:09,774
That's wrong.
You got to test that over. Test that again!

2782
02:29:09,857 --> 02:29:11,276
We've run the test five times

2783
02:29:11,359 --> 02:29:14,070
with five different samples
and the result remains the same.

2784
02:29:14,112 --> 02:29:15,405
- Shit!
- Tomica.

2785
02:29:17,657 --> 02:29:19,117
Tomica.

2786
02:29:19,909 --> 02:29:22,120
But she's pregnant, Doc. What's this mean?

2787
02:29:22,203 --> 02:29:25,373
It doesn't necessarily mean
that she's contracted the virus,

2788
02:29:25,415 --> 02:29:27,917
but we have to test her to be sure.

2789
02:29:28,418 --> 02:29:31,087
What do we do? When we start the treatment?

2790
02:29:31,129 --> 02:29:33,756
I mean, what... I gotta get healthy.

2791
02:29:33,798 --> 02:29:36,050
I got things to do. I got...

2792
02:29:37,677 --> 02:29:39,220
What am I supposed to do?

2793
02:29:39,262 --> 02:29:41,764
Mr. Wright, you need to understand

2794
02:29:42,557 --> 02:29:44,100
that you are very, very sick.

2795
02:29:44,142 --> 02:29:47,437
But I don't even feel that bad, Doc.
Don't tell me that.

2796
02:29:47,520 --> 02:29:49,522
With care and palliative care,

2797
02:29:49,689 --> 02:29:51,357
we can probably keep you comfortable

2798
02:29:51,441 --> 02:29:54,235
for maybe six months, at the very most.

2799
02:29:54,277 --> 02:29:55,612
Comfortable?

2800
02:29:55,695 --> 02:29:58,156
What do you mean, comfortable?

2801
02:30:01,743 --> 02:30:03,411
It's just a matter of time.

2802
02:30:05,622 --> 02:30:09,959
I am truly, truly sorry, Mr. Wright.

2803
02:30:10,627 --> 02:30:14,464
I'll leave you time to process this.

2804
02:30:16,925 --> 02:30:18,760
Doc. Come on, Doc. No.

2805
02:30:19,302 --> 02:30:20,303
Doc.

2806
02:30:32,357 --> 02:30:33,691
Come on!

2807
02:30:38,947 --> 02:30:40,990
And one of the pioneers of gangster rap,

2808
02:30:41,032 --> 02:30:44,369
as the leader of the group N.W.A
has revealed he has AIDS...

2809
02:30:44,619 --> 02:30:46,120
We were totally unprepared

2810
02:30:46,162 --> 02:30:49,499
for the kind of outpouring
of fan calls that we had.

2811
02:30:49,582 --> 02:30:52,001
We had over 7,000 calls.

2812
02:30:54,671 --> 02:30:55,672
I can't.

2813
02:30:59,008 --> 02:31:01,177
Just let me make this right.

2814
02:31:01,970 --> 02:31:03,221
Please.

2815
02:31:04,013 --> 02:31:06,015
'Cause you healthy?

2816
02:31:09,394 --> 02:31:12,522
- And the baby healthy.
- Yeah. We're healthy.

2817
02:31:12,772 --> 02:31:14,440
- So?
- Okay.

2818
02:31:16,192 --> 02:31:17,694
But I just...

2819
02:31:19,195 --> 02:31:20,655
I love you.

2820
02:31:21,447 --> 02:31:24,367
And I don't want none of this.
I just want you to be...

2821
02:31:24,450 --> 02:31:26,035
Here.

2822
02:31:43,386 --> 02:31:45,972
- Are we ready?
- Yeah.

2823
02:31:46,598 --> 02:31:51,769
Tomica Woods, do you take Eric Wright
to be your lawfully wedded husband?

2824
02:31:54,981 --> 02:31:57,984
It's Bone Thugs' new LP, man.

2825
02:31:58,151 --> 02:32:00,904
Everybody thinks
it's gonna be cool when it drop.

2826
02:32:01,863 --> 02:32:04,324
- It's gonna be huge, man.
- That's great.

2827
02:32:04,741 --> 02:32:07,911
Do you wanna hear it, man?
You wanna hear it?

2828
02:32:07,994 --> 02:32:09,078
Nah, man.

2829
02:32:09,162 --> 02:32:10,413
Just leave it here for me.

2830
02:32:10,455 --> 02:32:12,123
I'll check it out later. Thanks.

2831
02:32:14,375 --> 02:32:16,294
This is bullshit, man.

2832
02:32:23,051 --> 02:32:25,553
Hey, Yella, why don't you check
on him, man? See if he ar'ight.

2833
02:32:25,887 --> 02:32:29,807
Ar'ight? I'll call you
when I get out of here.

2834
02:32:32,769 --> 02:32:34,020
Ar'ight?

2835
02:32:59,128 --> 02:33:00,129
What's his condition?

2836
02:33:00,213 --> 02:33:02,465
His condition... He's in intensive care.

2837
02:33:03,383 --> 02:33:05,677
We're not certain where it's headed.

2838
02:33:34,372 --> 02:33:35,915
'Sup, Eric?

2839
02:33:39,377 --> 02:33:40,378
It's Dre.

2840
02:33:43,965 --> 02:33:47,510
Man, I've been makin' some dope new tracks.

2841
02:33:49,012 --> 02:33:52,432
This next N.W.A album,
it's about to be dope.

2842
02:33:52,932 --> 02:33:56,227
It's about to be huge, you know?

2843
02:33:58,771 --> 02:34:00,857
Hey, you remember that time

2844
02:34:02,025 --> 02:34:04,277
when we was making Boyz-N-The Hood?

2845
02:34:07,989 --> 02:34:09,532
Your non-rappin' ass.

2846
02:34:09,574 --> 02:34:11,618
You was trippin' out, man.

2847
02:34:35,892 --> 02:34:37,560
I love you, E.

2848
02:34:40,230 --> 02:34:42,440
You hear me? I love you, man.

2849
02:34:47,987 --> 02:34:49,113
Dre.

2850
02:34:50,990 --> 02:34:51,991
Yo, Cube.

2851
02:34:55,787 --> 02:34:58,915
How is he doing? Can he talk? Can he...

2852
02:34:58,998 --> 02:35:02,043
Nah, man. He in a fuckin' coma.

2853
02:35:04,128 --> 02:35:07,048
Got the machines breathing
for him and shit.

2854
02:35:07,090 --> 02:35:08,675
He ain't even conscious.

2855
02:35:11,386 --> 02:35:13,930
I need to hear his voice, Dre.

2856
02:35:15,265 --> 02:35:16,975
I wanna talk to him.

2857
02:35:18,059 --> 02:35:20,395
I want him to talk to me.

2858
02:35:22,063 --> 02:35:24,148
I feel that.

2859
02:35:27,402 --> 02:35:28,903
It's all right, man.

2860
02:35:31,823 --> 02:35:33,283
It was good to see you, man.

2861
02:35:33,324 --> 02:35:34,409
You too.

2862
02:35:38,121 --> 02:35:39,330
Peace.

2863
02:35:53,887 --> 02:35:55,007
In Los Angeles this morning,

2864
02:35:55,054 --> 02:35:57,765
rapper Eazy-E has died
after a battle with AIDS.

2865
02:35:58,683 --> 02:36:01,811
He was among the most
powerful voices of his generation.

2866
02:36:01,936 --> 02:36:03,816
Towards the end
of his life, the rapper received

2867
02:36:03,855 --> 02:36:06,900
more than two and a half thousand calls
a day from well-wishers...

2868
02:36:06,983 --> 02:36:09,110
...Member of the group N.W.A,

2869
02:36:09,152 --> 02:36:11,988
which helped popularize
harsh inner-city rap music.

2870
02:36:12,030 --> 02:36:13,615
Wright was 31.

2871
02:36:14,824 --> 02:36:15,825
Eazy's gone.

2872
02:36:16,701 --> 02:36:17,952
He gone?

2873
02:36:23,166 --> 02:36:24,417
Shit.

2874
02:36:25,793 --> 02:36:27,545
- Okay.
- Okay.

2875
02:36:38,932 --> 02:36:40,225
Damn, E.

2876
02:36:58,201 --> 02:37:00,286
Eazy wrote me a personal letter

2877
02:37:00,370 --> 02:37:02,872
to read to each and every one
of his fans and loved ones.

2878
02:37:03,998 --> 02:37:06,876
"I just feel that I've got
thousands and thousands of young fans

2879
02:37:07,252 --> 02:37:11,214
"that have to learn
about what's real when it comes to AIDS.

2880
02:37:11,297 --> 02:37:14,509
"I would like to turn my own problem
into something good

2881
02:37:14,551 --> 02:37:18,888
"that will reach out
to all my homeboys and their kin.

2882
02:37:18,930 --> 02:37:22,016
"Much love to those
who have been down for me

2883
02:37:22,058 --> 02:37:23,977
"and thanks for your support."

2884
02:37:35,238 --> 02:37:37,699
Pac is in the
studio writing every day.

2885
02:37:37,740 --> 02:37:40,368
Snoop is doing his thing.
Whatcha all doing?

2886
02:37:40,410 --> 02:37:42,203
Y'all niggas are getting too comfortable.

2887
02:37:42,287 --> 02:37:44,122
- Handle this shit.
- Suge.

2888
02:37:47,125 --> 02:37:48,293
What's the urgency, Dre?

2889
02:37:48,376 --> 02:37:50,169
Plotz.

2890
02:37:50,253 --> 02:37:51,504
I'm out.

2891
02:37:51,713 --> 02:37:53,256
I'm outta Death Row.

2892
02:37:54,966 --> 02:37:56,676
You ain't done.

2893
02:37:56,759 --> 02:37:58,261
Dr. Dre and Death Row are one and the same.

2894
02:37:58,303 --> 02:37:59,554
You just can't up and leave.

2895
02:37:59,596 --> 02:38:01,347
I'm doing my own thing, Suge.

2896
02:38:01,973 --> 02:38:03,224
Starting fresh.

2897
02:38:03,266 --> 02:38:05,518
Nobody to answer to but myself.

2898
02:38:06,477 --> 02:38:07,604
It's time.

2899
02:38:07,687 --> 02:38:09,272
You're one stupid motherfucker.

2900
02:38:09,397 --> 02:38:11,232
You gonna walk away from all this money?

2901
02:38:11,524 --> 02:38:12,775
If you leave,

2902
02:38:12,817 --> 02:38:14,736
everything we created is mine.

2903
02:38:14,777 --> 02:38:17,280
We? Okay.

2904
02:38:17,322 --> 02:38:20,033
You know what? You can have it.

2905
02:38:21,784 --> 02:38:24,037
You ain't taking nobody with you.

2906
02:38:24,120 --> 02:38:26,122
Death Row stays Death Row.

2907
02:38:26,164 --> 02:38:29,417
And you even think
about touching my money...

2908
02:38:29,459 --> 02:38:31,586
Motherfucker, you know how I gets down.

2909
02:38:31,628 --> 02:38:33,296
Do what the fuck you gotta do.

2910
02:38:33,796 --> 02:38:36,090
You can have the artists, the money,

2911
02:38:36,132 --> 02:38:38,259
the masters, all your fuckin' bullshit.

2912
02:38:38,301 --> 02:38:39,719
I'm done.

2913
02:38:41,346 --> 02:38:43,306
I'm starting my own thing.

2914
02:38:44,057 --> 02:38:46,684
You can't put a price on peace of mind.

2915
02:38:48,311 --> 02:38:49,812
I'm out.

2916
02:38:54,651 --> 02:38:56,194
I got all this nigga's money.

2917
02:38:56,277 --> 02:38:58,112
I got everything.

2918
02:38:58,863 --> 02:39:00,490
Get the fuck out. Go!

2919
02:39:05,328 --> 02:39:07,830
So whatchu gonna call that bullshit?

2920
02:39:11,876 --> 02:39:13,711
Aftermath.

2921
02:39:17,257 --> 02:39:18,925
You are now about to witness

2922
02:39:19,008 --> 02:39:20,843
the strength of street knowledge.

2923
02:39:25,723 --> 02:39:28,017
It's just, like,
they try to hide what's goin' on

2924
02:39:28,101 --> 02:39:29,644
and we tell it like it is, you know?

2925
02:39:35,024 --> 02:39:36,526
You know it's gotta be hard,

2926
02:39:36,568 --> 02:39:38,611
'cause if it ain't hard, it's weak.

2927
02:39:44,284 --> 02:39:45,493
MC Ren in the house.

2928
02:39:45,535 --> 02:39:46,578
When you making a record,

2929
02:39:46,661 --> 02:39:47,704
you gotta have some hype lyrics.

2930
02:39:47,745 --> 02:39:49,105
And you got that, it's gonna sell.

2931
02:39:53,585 --> 02:39:56,045
Eazy-E probably was one of the nicest
people you ever would have known.

2932
02:39:56,087 --> 02:39:58,256
Not as Eazy, but as Eric Wright.

2933
02:40:03,386 --> 02:40:05,430
We make our records based on

2934
02:40:05,513 --> 02:40:08,224
stuff that's happening where we live.

2935
02:40:08,266 --> 02:40:10,852
And if people out there
that don't like it, fuck 'em.

2936
02:40:15,106 --> 02:40:18,151
Dre and Eazy, they had already
been selling it as cassette tapes.

2937
02:40:18,234 --> 02:40:19,319
And they just blew up.

2938
02:40:19,402 --> 02:40:22,238
Eazy and Dr. Dre Wild and Wet Pool Party.

2939
02:40:22,280 --> 02:40:24,073
This is what it's all about!

2940
02:40:24,157 --> 02:40:26,075
We wanted to invite you
to the President's luncheon.

2941
02:40:26,117 --> 02:40:28,703
I said if I go down there,
this'll start some shit.

2942
02:40:30,997 --> 02:40:34,083
When I think of N.W.A,
they weren't really music to me.

2943
02:40:34,167 --> 02:40:36,085
It was more like a real lifestyle.

2944
02:40:36,169 --> 02:40:37,849
Brothers from my neighborhood made it out.

2945
02:40:42,592 --> 02:40:45,178
- You got the dopest album out this year.
- Thanks, man.

2946
02:40:45,261 --> 02:40:46,721
More than happy to get my career

2947
02:40:46,763 --> 02:40:48,264
going like I want it to go.

2948
02:40:48,306 --> 02:40:49,349
Damn!

2949
02:40:54,187 --> 02:40:56,439
You do not know
how long I waited to get in his booth

2950
02:40:56,522 --> 02:40:59,025
and to have Dre out there goin',
"You ready?"

2951
02:40:59,108 --> 02:41:01,468
I waited all my life for that,
since Straight Outta Compton.

2952
02:41:02,111 --> 02:41:03,571
Dre's direction was helping me

2953
02:41:03,613 --> 02:41:05,448
become a strong lyricist, which I am now.

2954
02:41:10,787 --> 02:41:11,955
Dre has taught me a lot.

2955
02:41:11,996 --> 02:41:14,249
Not just rap-wise, but business-wise,

2956
02:41:14,290 --> 02:41:15,458
you know what I'm sayin'?

2957
02:41:15,542 --> 02:41:17,710
You'd have to even credit
both Eminem's and my success'

2958
02:41:17,794 --> 02:41:18,878
to Dr. Dre.

2959
02:41:20,880 --> 02:41:22,298
Apple's purchase of Beats

2960
02:41:22,382 --> 02:41:24,676
will be the biggest deal in its history.

2961
02:41:24,759 --> 02:41:26,261
Our music was like our weapon.

2962
02:41:26,302 --> 02:41:27,887
We let people know that it's okay

2963
02:41:27,971 --> 02:41:29,471
to say whatchu wanna say.
