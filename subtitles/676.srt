1
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,620
Good God.

2
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,620
Matthew. Matthew.

3
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,040
Matthew.

4
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,430
<i>They say your whole life
flashes before your eyes...</i>

5
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,130
<i>when you die.</i>

6
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,510
<i>And it's true... even
for a blind man.</i>

7
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,790
<i>I grew up in Hell's Kitchen.</i>

8
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:44,380
<i>The politicians and the real estate
developers call it Clinton now...</i>

9
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,330
<i>but a neighborhood, like
everything else, has a soul.</i>

10
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,200
- He's about to cry.
<i>And souls don't change with the name.</i>

11
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,723
Come on, shrimp. Hit me.
I'll give you a free shot.

12
00:05:54,748 --> 00:05:55,555
Hit him again, man.

13
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,730
- You fight like your dad.
- Yeah.

14
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,360
- Come on. Hit me.
- My dad's gonna be champ.

15
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,186
- Your dad's a bum.
- Yeah. A bum.

16
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:04,064
- Come on. Hit me.

17
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,270
He's a punk.

18
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,850
- Yeah. He's a punk, man.
- Can't fight. Sure can run though.

19
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,010
Pathetic.

20
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,640
<i>My father was a boxer.</i>

21
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,320
<i>A sportswriter once wrote that
he fought like the devil...</i>

22
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,890
<i>and the name stuck.</i>

23
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,430
<i>Jack "The Devil" Murdock
was a contender.</i>

24
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,930
<i>But that was a long time ago.</i>

25
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,760
Come on, Dad. Get up.

26
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:39,010
- Who won?
- Cohan.

27
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,080
Yeah?

28
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,150
- I beat him, you know.
- I know, Dad.

29
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:48,920
- T.K.O.
- That's right, Matty. You remember.

30
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:56,830
- Hey. Hey, what's that?
- Nothin'.

31
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,800
I told you I didn't
want you fightin'.

32
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,430
I tried to walk away
like you said...

33
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,630
but they kept givin' me shit.

34
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,760
Don't curse.

35
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,930
What kind of shit?

36
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:18,740
They said that you work for Fallon,
that you're one of his guys now.

37
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,820
Get over here. Sit down.

38
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,890
Come on.

39
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,420
You think I'd be pullin' double
overtime down at the docks...

40
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:30,720
if I was workin' for Fallon?

41
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,660
What, are you nuts?

42
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:36,670
You don't hit nothin' but books.
Get me?

43
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,070
You be a doctor or a lawyer.

44
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,110
Not like me.

45
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,400
Dad...

46
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:47,710
Matt... you can do it.

47
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,910
You can do anything
if you're not afraid.

48
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,990
Now you promise me.

49
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:00,490
I promise, Dad.

50
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,590
Hey, John, pull that
line all the way in...

51
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,830
then bring the crane
around front, all right?

52
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,070
Hey, kid! What are you trying
to get yourself killed?

53
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:49,900
I'm lookin' for my dad, Jack Murdock.
You seen him around?

54
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:53,000
Murdock? Nah, he ain't
worked here in months.

55
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,380
Now, beat it, huh?

56
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,970
Jack, I don't want
you to hurt me.

57
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,630
- I will!
- Jack, come on. I got obligations.

58
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,800
- Dad?
- Okay, I got it!

59
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,210
Matt?

60
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,220
Matt!

61
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,670
No!

62
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:42,270
Matty, I, uh, I talked
to the doctor...

63
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,580
I'm blind. I know.

64
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:49,280
- How could you know?
- I heard you talking in his office.

65
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,720
I hear everything.

66
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:56,090
Something's happening to me, Dad.
I don't know what it is.

67
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,100
I'm sorry, Matty.

68
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,470
I'm so sorry.

69
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,570
<i>We made each other
a silent promise.</i>

70
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,540
<i>To never give up.</i>

71
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:55,090
<i>To be fearless.</i>

72
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,920
<i>To stick up for the
long shots like us.</i>

73
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:03,250
<i>We were two fighters
on the comeback trail.</i>

74
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,700
<i>I had lost my sight, but I got
something back in return.</i>

75
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:17,040
<i>My remaining four senses...</i>

76
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,610
<i>functioned with
superhuman sharpness.</i>

77
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,780
<i>But most amazing of all...</i>

78
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:28,450
<i>my sense of sound gave off
a kind of radar sense.</i>

79
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:51,980
<i>High above the roar
of the streets...</i>

80
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,170
<i>I trained my body and my senses.</i>

81
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,519
<i>An acute sense of touch gave me
both strength and balance...</i>

82
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,510
<i>An acute sense of touch gave me
both strength and balance...</i>

83
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,580
<i>until the city itself
became my playground.</i>

84
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,430
<i>I was the boy without fear.</i>

85
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,230
Whoo-hoo!

86
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,970
The winner!

87
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:37,180
Hey, Murdock! Round two.

88
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:45,320
- What's up, freak?
- Look at him, man. Look at his eyes.

89
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,490
Hooo-ooh!

90
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,230
- Kick his ass, man.
- Go ahead, fight me. I dare ya.

91
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,310
- Yeah, Murdock.
- I dare ya.

92
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:55,570
That's what I'm sayin',
man, kick his ass.

93
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,780
Come on, man. Let's just go.

94
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:04,110
Okay.

95
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,260
Jack, it's been a while.

96
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,660
I don't work for
you no more, Fallon.

97
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:56,700
Jack, you never stopped.

98
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,600
Did you really think you won
those fights on your own?

99
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,680
You're 42 years old.

100
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,610
Miller, Mack, Bendez?

101
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:09,610
They're all my fighters...

102
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,680
just like you.

103
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:15,950
And now it's your
turn to take a fall.

104
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:19,360
Think about your boy, Jack.

105
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,930
I'm sure you'll do
the right thing.

106
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,590
Matty.

107
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,060
Stop... Stop clinching.

108
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,290
Let him go. Clean fight.

109
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:40,100
No! Come on, Dad! Come on, Dad!
Get up!

110
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:42,730
You can do it! Come on!

111
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,640
Come on, Dad! Get up!

112
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,210
Come on!

113
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,410
Let's go! Come on!

114
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,650
Come on, Dad! Get up!

115
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,220
Never give up! Remember?

116
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:01,160
Yeah! Yeah! Come on, Dad!
All right!

117
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,360
You all right? Murdock!
You all right?

118
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,130
- Okay. Let's fight!
- Go, Dad! Go!

119
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:19,940
Ten! He's out! Fight's over!

120
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:30,580
Ladies and gentlemen, the
winner, by way of knock-out...

121
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:34,490
Jack "The Devil" Murdock!

122
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:49,210
This one was for you, Matty.

123
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,780
I waited outside of the
Olympic for my father.

124
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,180
In some ways, I'm still waiting.

125
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,300
Finish him off!.

126
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:20,730
Dad!

127
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:13,160
I can't see you, Dad.

128
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,290
I can't see you.

129
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,290
<i>No one cared much
about the death...</i>

130
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:45,150
<i>of a washed-up prizefighter.</i>

131
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,280
<i>Nobody but me.</i>

132
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,690
<i>I would keep my promise.</i>

133
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,420
<i>I would help those
that others wouldn't.</i>

134
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:55,130
<i>I would seek justice...</i>

135
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,200
<i>one way...</i>

136
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,570
<i>or another.</i>

137
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:52,610
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're here today...

138
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,120
to seek truth...

139
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:58,250
to seek justice.

140
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,230
Mr. Quesada, would you
state for the court...

141
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:04,890
the sequence of events leading
up to the night of June 30?

142
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,630
I stopped off at Josie's
Bar after work.

143
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:12,900
I had a few drinks.
Angela was there.

144
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:16,840
She was closing up. She asked me
if I wanted to stick around...

145
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,000
for some fun.

146
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,120
Anything that happened after
that was entirely consensual.

147
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:34,070
Are you aware that perjury
is a crime, Mr. Quesada?

148
00:23:34,095 --> 00:23:34,954
Objection.

149
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:37,220
My client is a respectable member of
the community, where Miss Sutton

150
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:39,048
has a history of drug

151
00:23:39,073 --> 00:23:40,194
- and alcohol abuse...
- My client is not on trial.

152
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:41,548
Which not only makes
her testimony

153
00:23:41,573 --> 00:23:42,914
- suspect...
- Nor is her testimony suspect.

154
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,330
- Gentlemen, that's enough.
- The truth is...

155
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,770
Mr. Murdock, is
that Miss Sutton...

156
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,640
Miss Sutton enjoyed
every minute of it.

157
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:00,240
Mr. Quesada, for your sake...

158
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:02,650
I hope justice is
found here today...

159
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,560
before justice finds you.

160
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,630
Matt? Matt, where are you going?

161
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,790
Man, we knew this was
a risk going in.

162
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,600
Why? She's from the Kitchen, she's
not from the Upper East Side?

163
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:23,110
Yeah. Come on, Matt. She has
a history of drug abuse.

164
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:24,333
That was a long time ago.

165
00:24:24,358 --> 00:24:26,964
Juries don't like their victims
flawed, you know that.

166
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,680
It's not right.

167
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,949
Yeah? Here's what I don't get.

168
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:37,010
How can a scumbag like Quesada
afford an attorney like Hirsch?

169
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,990
He can't. The Kingpin's
gotta be footing the bill.

170
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:45,290
- Come on. Let's go get drunk.
- Not tonight.

171
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,370
I got work to do.

172
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:00,900
- D.

173
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,800
Line 'em up, Josie, I'm
ready to party tonight.

174
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:10,740
You got a lot of nerve comin'
in here after what you did.

175
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:13,910
- Didn't you hear?
I'm innocent, baby.

176
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:22,090
Bikes behind the cage!

177
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,960
No burn-outs, you assholes!

178
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:32,370
- Whoo! Yeah!

179
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:43,080
D.

180
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,410
Hey, hey, hey! What's happenin'?

181
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:54,490
- Hey, Louie.
- What's up, goombah?

182
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,590
To the justice system, right?
Of course I beat it.

183
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,190
Kingpin's got my back, bro.
How ya doin' sweetie?

184
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:08,270
- Boss.
- What's up?

185
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:10,340
What's up with that?

186
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,410
Is that guy for real?

187
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:16,600
Yeah, he's for real.

188
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,450
- What do you want?
- Justice.

189
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:22,610
D.

190
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,780
Quesada!

191
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:39,690
Time to give the devil his due.

192
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:57,600
Oh, God! Oh, God!

193
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:04,370
Hi. How ya doin'?

194
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,380
Didn't you hear?

195
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,880
- I was acquitted.
- Not by me.

196
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:15,950
Who made you judge?

197
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:19,460
Wh... You did.

198
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:36,070
- Go to hell... diablo.

199
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:40,870
Okay, but you'll beat me there.

200
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,890
Hey. That light...

201
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:56,290
at the end of the tunnel?

202
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,420
Guess what? That's not heaven.

203
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:02,760
- I'll kill you!
- That's the "C" Train.

204
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,770
Oh, my God!

205
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:16,750
Hey. You can't go past there.

206
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:19,110
- Call Charlie.
- Right.

207
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,620
You're wastin' your time, Urich.

208
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,660
- There's nothin' to see here.
- Jose Quesada...

209
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:30,430
and the rest of Jose Quesada.

210
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:33,360
Whole lotta nothin', huh, Nick?

211
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:34,898
You keep runnin' those stories,

212
00:32:34,923 --> 00:32:36,354
and we're gonna end up with a
bunch of copycat vigilantes...

213
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,400
who are gonna get
themselves killed.

214
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:42,670
Are you here to confirm that Daredevil
is responsible for this, Detective?

215
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:45,270
Come on, Urich.
Stop bustin' my...

216
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:50,510
There is no proof that your
so-called Daredevil was involved...

217
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:53,050
nor that he even exists.

218
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:55,520
- Got it?

219
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:09,200
Got it.

220
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:31,550
<i>Can one man make a difference?</i>

221
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:34,090
<i>There are days when I believe...</i>

222
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:36,160
<i>...and others when I
have lost all faith.</i>

223
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:13,460
Matt, it's Heather.
Are you there?

224
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:16,730
Of course you're not there.
You're never there.

225
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,170
At least not for me.

226
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:22,430
Look, I didn't wanna do
this over the phone...

227
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,530
but it's not like you've
given me any choice.

228
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,870
I mean, it's been
three months now...

229
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,880
and I've never even
seen your apartment.

230
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:33,250
Every time we sleep together, I
wake up in the morning alone.

231
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:37,220
I mean, Jesus, where do you
go at 3..00 in the morning?

232
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:41,890
I thought that if I waited, if I was
patient enough, you'd let me in...

233
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:47,460
that we'd take our relationship
to the next level.

234
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:51,560
Then I realized that
this is the next level.

235
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:55,130
Good-bye, Matt. I hope you
find what you're looking for.

236
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:10,980
Please, don't hurt me.

237
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,980
Please, don't do that.

238
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:17,110
Shh. Sleep now.

239
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:43,400
Listen to this. "Eyewitnesses say
that Quesada was singled out...

240
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:47,140
by the demonic vigilante
known as the Daredevil."

241
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:49,110
I don't know why you
read that trash.

242
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:50,679
I've been hearin' stories
about this guy for years.

243
00:37:50,704 --> 00:37:51,917
There's gotta be
somethin' to it.

244
00:37:51,942 --> 00:37:52,934
What? Like.. Like the
alligators in the sewers?

245
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,534
There are alligators in the sewers.
Don't run my ass about the alligators.

246
00:37:55,559 --> 00:37:57,504
I got a friend in Sanitation, OK?
He's seen them.

247
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:59,390
Fine. Just drop it.

248
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:02,050
You should see this guy.
They got this picture...

249
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,117
They have a picture?

250
00:38:03,142 --> 00:38:05,484
Yeah, it's, like, a drawing,
an artist's rendering.

251
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,730
It's just... It's grotesque.

252
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:11,230
I'd hate to see this
guy's therapy bills.

253
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:15,200
Speaking of bills, your client Mr.
Lee, he made his first payment.

254
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,485
Oh, that's great. You
should be very happy.

255
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:17,304
Yeah, it's fantastic.

256
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,840
He paid in fluke.

257
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:23,640
Fluke is a fish, Matt. Did you know that?
Because I sure as hell didn't.

258
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:26,080
Mr. Lee is a good man, and he...
doesn't have a lot of money...

259
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:28,590
and he goes fishing
on the weekends.

260
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:30,518
I go salsa dancing weekends,
but I don't shake my

261
00:38:30,543 --> 00:38:32,444
ass to pay my phone bill.
You know what I'm sayin'?

262
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,860
Pass the honey, please.

263
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,590
We need some better clients. I'm
tired of these pro bono cases.

264
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,530
What is your problem with our clients?
We have good, honorable clients.

265
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:44,930
Decent people. What's your idea
of"better"? Define "better."

266
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:51,470
- What would be a better client?
- "Better" means rich and guilty. Okay?

267
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:54,550
Remember when they taught us in law
school how to create a moral vacuum...

268
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:56,840
so you could represent people who
aren't all necessarily innocent?

269
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,920
That was your best
course, as I recall.

270
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:01,310
You don't have a moral vacuum, Matt.

271
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,120
You are completely vacuumless.

272
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,720
And what happened to your face?

273
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,850
It's nothing. It's a small cut.
I walked into a door.

274
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:11,306
Matt, every time you disappear,
we can't get ahold of you on

275
00:39:11,331 --> 00:39:13,784
the phone and I'm here working alone,
you come in and you all cut up.

276
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:16,343
I'm in the fight club.
The first rule of fight

277
00:39:16,368 --> 00:39:18,524
club: Don't talk about fight club.
So...

278
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,332
You're not in the fight
club, you're out of it.

279
00:39:20,357 --> 00:39:21,294
I didn't see the movie.

280
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:24,100
I'm sure it's a funny joke,
but I didn't see it.

281
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:28,200
Okay, all I'm sayin' is I'm
here for you as a friend.

282
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:31,540
I mean, I hate to bring it up again, but
I spent $3,000 on that Seeing Eye dog.

283
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:32,583
I didn't ask you for the dog.

284
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:34,404
- I didn't want a dog!
- Can I say something else?

285
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:38,080
Seeing Eye dogs bond for
life... yours ran away.

286
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:41,220
What does that tell you about how
emotionally available you are?

287
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,960
- What? What? Where? Where?

288
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:51,660
Front door. Not yet. Soon.

289
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,670
Now.

290
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,910
Tell me.

291
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:11,080
- You want the truth?
- Absolutely.

292
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:15,130
She's hideous. I don't
know if it's a fungus...

293
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:17,350
or some sort of
congenital birth defect.

294
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,320
But as your attorney in this
matter, I advise you...

295
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:22,160
take no further action.

296
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:31,670
- I'm sorry. Excuse me.
- Sure.

297
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:34,870
Uh... I was just looking
for some honey.

298
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:38,780
- Could you help me out?
- Right in front of you.

299
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,110
Well...

300
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,350
could you be a little
bit more specific?

301
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:46,690
- What are you...
- Blind? Yeah.

302
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:50,280
- I am so sorry.
- That's okay.

303
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,660
The, uh...

304
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:57,860
- Friend of yours?
- I've never seen him before.

305
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,070
Matt Murdock.

306
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:05,170
Nice to meet you, Matt Murdock.

307
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,470
Nice to meet you. Uh...

308
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,050
I didn't get your name.

309
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:16,850
I didn't give it.

310
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,200
I tell ya, some people have no
compassion for the handicapped.

311
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,320
Apparently not.

312
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,490
- Where you goin'?
- Gonna file an appeal.

313
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,540
We have to be in the
courthouse by noon.

314
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,610
- 12:00, Matt.
- I'll be there.

315
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:51,850
- What do you want?
- I just wanted to get your name.

316
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,860
- I didn't want any trouble.
- Look...

317
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,520
I don't like being
followed, so don't.

318
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:01,530
Uh, wait a minute.

319
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:05,030
Wait a second. Take it easy.

320
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:09,270
And I don't like being touched.

321
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:12,210
Why don't you tell me what you
do like, and we'll start there.

322
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:31,890
Sure you're blind?

323
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,930
Sure you don't wanna
tell me your name?

324
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,430
- You're holding back.
- Yes.

325
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:06,360
Don't.

326
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,030
Does every guy have to go through
all this to find out your name?

327
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:15,440
Try asking for my number.

328
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:19,870
Fight! Fight! Fight!

329
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,190
Stop hitting me.

330
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,130
Okay.

331
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,930
My name's Elektra Natchios.

332
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:56,240
Thanks. That's all
I wanted to know.

333
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,280
I have to go.

334
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:08,020
Go? Wait a second. Hold on.

335
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:10,490
D-Don't... I don't wanna get
my ass kicked again...

336
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,560
I just want to know
why you have to go.

337
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,730
My bodyguard is here.

338
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:19,570
Your bodyguard?

339
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:22,610
If you need a bodyguard,
I'm in serious trouble.

340
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:26,070
I thought I lost him
at the coffee shop.

341
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:28,240
Dad can be a little
overprotective.

342
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:32,440
Oh, "Natchios." Right, as
in "Nikolas Natchios."

343
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:34,050
That's Dad.

344
00:44:34,098 --> 00:44:35,698
[Speaking in Greek]
<i>Elektra, let's go!</i>

345
00:44:35,722 --> 00:44:37,122
<i>Leave me alone!</i>

346
00:44:37,746 --> 00:44:39,746
<i>Asshole...</i>

347
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,320
How am I going to find you?

348
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:47,660
You won't.

349
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:53,460
I'll find you.

350
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:07,240
Shit!

351
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:47,680
- What's wrong, Wesley?
- Have you seen the papers today?

352
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:50,690
Somebody's been talking.

353
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,760
Somebody always does.

354
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:59,870
Wesley, did you know,
back in ancient times...

355
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:05,000
they would cut the tongues out of their
bodyguards their first day on the job?

356
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:08,910
You think that's
horrible, don't you?

357
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:11,920
'Cause you don't like
the physical stuff.

358
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:16,080
I do.

359
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:34,230
Whoo!

360
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:36,670
Wesley, handkerchief.

361
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:47,580
Your 11:00 is here.

362
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:51,710
Natchios, my dear old friend.

363
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:06,170
I'm getting out, Wilson.
Uh... I am out.

364
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:10,800
You think it's funny?

365
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:14,310
They're writing
about the Kingpin.

366
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:17,000
They're going back
to the beginning.

367
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:20,350
Oh, I'm tired of looking
over my shoulder.

368
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:23,480
I wanna put all that behind me, now.
I want you to buy me out.

369
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:28,180
I think you'll find this
a very generous offer.

370
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,160
So, what do you say?

371
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:47,750
How's your daughter?

372
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,020
I said I was sorry.
What do you want?

373
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,450
Details. You owe me that.

374
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:01,830
Her name's Elektra Natchios.

375
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:04,420
She sounds like a
Mexican appetizer.

376
00:48:04,530 --> 00:48:08,800
It's Greek, genius. Her
father's Nikolas Natchios.

377
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,430
- The billionaire?
- Yeah. See? Yes, the billionaire.

378
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:16,740
Then as your attorney in this matter, I
advise you to marry the woman immediately.

379
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,930
I'll take it under
consideration.

380
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:22,910
- What do we got?
- Oh, this one's a real winner.

381
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:24,980
Daunte Jackson,
ex-con from Queens...

382
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:27,380
charged with the August 9th
murder of Lisa Tazio...

383
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:29,480
your friendly
neighborhood prostitute.

384
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:32,250
The bad news is Jackson was
found passed-out in an alley...

385
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,420
holding the murder weapon...

386
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:37,960
and enough THC in his lungs
to get Staten Island high.

387
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:40,930
Jackson says he can't remember what
happened on the night of the murder...

388
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:42,969
or, for that matter,
most of the '90s.

389
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:43,986
What's the good news?

390
00:48:44,111 --> 00:48:46,724
The fluke wasn't bad. Could
you let us in, please?

391
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,900
Mr. Jackson.

392
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:58,140
Who are you?

393
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:01,310
We're your attorneys.

394
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:03,019
If you're innocent.

395
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:07,390
So, are you... innocent?

396
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:12,160
Yeah.

397
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:14,890
Hell yeah.

398
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:20,190
I believe you.

399
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:22,200
Y-You do?

400
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:26,040
- You do?
- You got yourself a defense.

401
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:32,580
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

402
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:37,080
I want you to create
a paper trail...

403
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:39,180
one that can be
traced to Natchios.

404
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:42,108
- Sir?
- The press want a kingpin,

405
00:49:42,133 --> 00:49:44,774
so I'll give 'em a kingpin.

406
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:46,960
Get me Bullseye.

407
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,590
Two out of three.

408
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:42,580
Bloody Irish piece of trash.

409
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,300
What do you think Jackson's
gonna pay us with? Chronic?

410
00:51:37,410 --> 00:51:39,380
- Foggy.
- Hey, the guy's a three-time loser.

411
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,640
They found him a block away with
the murder weapon in his hand.

412
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:43,870
Which makes the fact that he's innocent
kinda interesting, don't you say?

413
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:45,449
How can you be so sure?

414
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:46,047
Have I ever been wrong?

415
00:51:46,072 --> 00:51:47,604
No. Which is really starting
to annoy me, by the way...

416
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:50,789
Hey! Come on, I got
a blind guy here!

417
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:55,230
- Use the crosswalk, asshole.
- I love this city.

418
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:14,570
Empty your pockets.

419
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:30,420
Raise your arms.

420
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:18,000
All right. This is it.

421
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:21,200
- Okay, now what?
- Take a look around.

422
00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:23,970
Look Matt, I know you have this
built-in bullshit detector...

423
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,180
but this time it's on the blink.

424
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,681
Let's just say for argument's
sake that Jackson is innocent...

425
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:29,644
He is innocent.

426
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:32,190
Then why someone going through
the trouble to set him up?

427
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:35,260
Why the big cover-up in the
death of a... prostitute?

428
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,620
I don't know. I
can't answer that.

429
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:41,260
I gotta find out more
about Lisa Tazio.

430
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:44,530
Well, you know, too bad
we don't have a key.

431
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:49,170
Matt? Matt, where are you going?

432
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:55,440
- Give me your pen.
- Right here. Leave a note?

433
00:53:56,950 --> 00:54:00,320
- Here.
- That's my pen.

434
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:15,700
I must've been sick the
day they taught that.

435
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,700
Was that real estate law?

436
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:24,269
- What do you see?
- What do I see? I see high ceilings...

437
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:28,700
I see hardwood floors under carpet,
I see some good feng shui...

438
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:30,310
You think they rented
this place yet?

439
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:26,430
What? Did she have a puppy?

440
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:29,769
- Ammonia.
- So what?

441
00:55:29,770 --> 00:55:32,470
Over blood.

442
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:35,470
Something else.

443
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:38,480
Cordite..., gunpowder.

444
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:43,550
She was shot here and
dragged outside...

445
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:45,680
to make it look like
a random robbery.

446
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:57,200
Come on, Matt, there's
nothin'over there. Let's go.

447
00:55:59,370 --> 00:56:01,330
Write this down.

448
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,709
She wrote something here
in a ballpoint pen.

449
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:06,540
The imprint is
still in the wood.

450
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:10,640
- "M-O-M."
- "M-O-M."

451
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:13,720
- "6-8."
- "6-8."

452
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:16,340
There. I knew it.
Her mother did it.

453
00:56:16,450 --> 00:56:19,360
Now can we please go before
we need attorneys too?

454
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:23,290
Miss. Susie is my son Larry's
daughter by his first marriage.

455
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:28,130
She eloped with this
semi-colored fella from London.

456
00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:30,360
What's the word for that?
Mulatto. Yeah.

457
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:33,340
Just let's say he had a
little cream in his coffee.

458
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:36,870
But he did very well for
himself on the Internet...

459
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:38,940
but don't ask me how, no...

460
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:42,710
You know, they did get me a
computer for Christmas last year.

461
00:56:42,810 --> 00:56:46,340
But I won't use it. I'm
afraid it's going to explode.

462
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:48,940
Oh, but who can afford
to fly these days?

463
00:56:49,050 --> 00:56:54,510
But then my sister Marjorie called and
said she had these frequent flyer miles...

464
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:58,390
and she couldn't use them because
her sciatic nerve was acting up.

465
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:01,260
So I said...

466
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:14,170
d.

467
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:17,349
Oh. She's sleeping.

468
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:18,510
Oh. She's sleeping.

469
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:23,350
- Can I get you anything before we land?
- More peanuts, please.

470
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,580
Bill Evert here at the
Manhattan Courthouse...

471
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:27,660
where accused killer
Daunte Jackson...

472
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,060
Jackson is accused
of gunning down...

473
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:36,600
Ladies and Gentlemen
of the jury...

474
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:40,190
I am not here to convice you that
Daunte Jackson is a model citizen.

475
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:45,370
He has been in and out of prisons and
reform schools since he was 12 years old...

476
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:47,910
but this is not a court
of character, however...

477
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:50,040
This is a court of law.

478
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:52,410
Isn't he facing the wrong way?

479
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:54,540
Don't worry, he's got them
right where he wants them.

480
00:57:54,650 --> 00:57:57,450
- Daunte Jackson is innocent.
- Yeah.

481
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:02,230
And that is what it's
been like for Mr. Jackson.

482
00:58:02,330 --> 00:58:05,060
Like trying to talk to a wall.

483
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:09,060
Does this defense come with a
two-drink minimum, Mr. Murdock?

484
00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:12,900
I'm sorry, Your Honor, I'm
trying to make a point.

485
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,800
You see, justice is blind...

486
00:58:16,310 --> 00:58:18,539
but it can be heard...

487
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:21,880
and, today, the truth will come out.
Thank you.

488
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,610
Here, r-r-right this way.

489
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:30,310
He's blind. He can't
see anything.

490
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,410
Okay, here's the, uh, the arm.

491
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:33,989
You got the arm there, Matt?

492
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:35,650
Just reach down. There you go.

493
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,650
I'm sorry.

494
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:41,860
Here we go. Right there.

495
00:58:41,870 --> 00:58:44,060
You got it? Okay.

496
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:49,210
- Was that too much?
- Yeah, it was a little much, you know.

497
00:58:49,310 --> 00:58:52,710
You always want to do the chair thing.
It's embarrassing.

498
00:58:52,810 --> 00:58:54,970
- We want sympathy, it's not The Gong Show.
- Okay.

499
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:59,379
Officer McKensie, you were the arriving
officer at the scene, isn't that right?

500
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:03,380
- That's correct.
- Please tell us what you observed.

501
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:08,989
I was a block away when I got
the call of shots being fired.

502
00:59:08,990 --> 00:59:11,760
When I arrived on the
scene, Lisa Tazio's body...

503
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:13,920
was lying dead on the
steps of her apartment.

504
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:18,690
I found Jackson passed
out in the alley.

505
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:21,900
- Still holding the murder weapon.
- What's wrong?

506
00:59:21,910 --> 00:59:25,970
- Tazio's wallet in his pocket.
- McKensie's telling the truth.

507
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:28,200
Yeah, that happens
sometimes in court.

508
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:33,410
No, no, no, no. Somebody
has to be lying.

509
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,850
- What's he doing here?
- Who?

510
00:59:40,290 --> 00:59:45,160
It's Ben Urich, the
reporter from the Post.

511
00:59:54,170 --> 00:59:57,260
So does this mean
you want a rematch?

512
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,640
I told you I'd find you.

513
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:05,720
How did you know
I wasn't a mugger?

514
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:11,620
Muggers don't usually wear
rose oil or high heels...

515
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,750
at least this far from Chelsea.

516
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:18,020
Come here.

517
01:00:18,130 --> 01:00:22,530
- There's something I wanna show you.
- Wait a second.

518
01:00:22,630 --> 01:00:25,160
Exactly how many women have
you brought up here, anyway?

519
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:29,330
Uh... you're my first.

520
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,410
- Good answer.
- I thought that was the right answer.

521
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:40,480
Look at this. It's so beautiful.

522
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:43,950
I know. This was my favorite view
of the city when I was a kid.

523
01:00:44,550 --> 01:00:47,020
I really wanted you to see this.

524
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:05,120
What's this?

525
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:08,830
Oh, that's from my mother.

526
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:11,240
For good luck.

527
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:15,240
It's beautiful. It's a
good luck charm, huh?

528
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:18,310
I could use one of those.
They make them in braille?

529
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:25,680
She gave it to me...
right before she died.

530
01:01:25,790 --> 01:01:27,980
What happened?

531
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:31,280
She was killed...

532
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:35,790
right in front of
me... I was five.

533
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:39,260
I'm sorry.

534
01:01:41,770 --> 01:01:43,460
No Greek tragedies, okay?

535
01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:46,330
Okay.

536
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,800
- I should go.
- No, no. Wait. Just wait.

537
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:54,370
Wait, wait, wait. Because
it-it's... It's about to rain.

538
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:57,850
- No, it's not.
- It is. It's... I'm telling you. I mean...

539
01:01:57,950 --> 01:02:00,249
The temperature dropped two or
three degrees. I can smell it.

540
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:03,120
The moisture in the air. It's
gonna rain any second now.

541
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:08,120
And when it rains, it's like
there's a rooftop on the world.

542
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:12,720
Each raindrop makes a sound the
first time it falls on a surface.

543
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:14,820
Just then it's like I...

544
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:18,930
It's like I can see again.

545
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:22,470
And I... I just wanna...

546
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:26,550
I just wanna see you.

547
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:32,840
Okay.

548
01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:35,350
Look. Here it comes.

549
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:42,460
Ah.

550
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:05,050
Oh, my God.

551
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:09,490
You are so beautiful.

552
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:43,550
Maybe you remember the Kingpin.

553
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:45,250
Do you remember me now?

554
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:47,950
- What?
- Get off me!

555
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:49,784
Matt, what's wrong?

556
01:03:49,809 --> 01:03:53,554
You think you can hold
out on the Kingpin, uh?

557
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:58,400
Matt!

558
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,100
I have to go.

559
01:04:01,110 --> 01:04:03,080
- You remember me now?
- I'm sorry.

560
01:04:06,450 --> 01:04:07,740
I have to go.

561
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:10,440
Matt.

562
01:04:10,450 --> 01:04:12,420
Matt.

563
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:23,090
Oh, no! No, no! Please!

564
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,490
Huh? You remember me now?
What are you, stupid?

565
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:31,630
You think you can hold
out on the Kingpin?

566
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:54,160
Get away from me!

567
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:22,050
Stay out of Hell's Kitchen.

568
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:26,850
This ain't your
neighborhood no more.

569
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:29,120
Kitchen belongs to
the Kingpin now.

570
01:05:47,850 --> 01:05:51,040
Please!

571
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:54,240
Please don't hurt me.

572
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:57,080
I'm not the bad guy, kid.

573
01:06:11,370 --> 01:06:13,800
I'm not the bad guy.

574
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,870
I'm not.

575
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:41,750
You know the great
strength of the Church?

576
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:45,960
Its sense of community.

577
01:06:46,070 --> 01:06:48,470
- Good morning, Father.
- Good morning.

578
01:06:48,570 --> 01:06:53,130
Now, this may come as a bit of
a surprise to you, Matthew...

579
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:55,760
but we are open on Sundays.

580
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:00,780
I like the quiet.

581
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:03,940
I don't think so, son. I
think you like the solitude.

582
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:11,280
And you find it in
here, do you, Matthew?

583
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:13,720
Sometimes.

584
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:34,910
Sometimes not.

585
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:38,710
You don't have to go
it alone, Matthew.

586
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:41,120
My confessional is open
to you all the time.

587
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:45,280
There's no keepin'
secrets from God, son.

588
01:07:45,390 --> 01:07:47,885
I'll tell you Matthew, I
spent 30 years in one

589
01:07:47,910 --> 01:07:50,354
of them boxes, there's
nothing I haven't heard.

590
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:55,960
Well, let's keep it that way.

591
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:04,840
So, we'll be seein'
ya Sunday then, huh?

592
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:28,330
OK, I'll have to call you back
because he just came in.

593
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:30,560
Good morning.

594
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:34,040
- Your ears must have been burning.
- Why?

595
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:36,630
This just came by messenger.

596
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:39,680
It's your invitation to the Black
& White Ball at the Grand.

597
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:43,210
- Plus one.
- Plus one? All right.

598
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:46,850
Coffee?

599
01:08:46,950 --> 01:08:49,390
Uh, no. No, thank you.

600
01:08:49,490 --> 01:08:51,620
I'd love a cup, Karen.
Thank you.

601
01:08:56,730 --> 01:08:58,700
I guess she's
making a fresh pot.

602
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:01,560
- Wow.

603
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:04,160
They spent some serious
money on this invitation.

604
01:09:04,270 --> 01:09:07,000
I mean, you should feel it.
It's engraved.

605
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:10,300
- What time you gonna pick me up?
- I'm not goin'.

606
01:09:10,410 --> 01:09:12,540
What? Are you crazy?

607
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:15,370
That place is gonna be crawlin'
with people... rich people.

608
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:18,510
People who pay their legal fees
with money, not with fish...

609
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:22,640
or with-with-with wheels of
cheese or with sports supplies.

610
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:24,720
I'm gonna fill you in on
a little secret, Matt.

611
01:09:24,820 --> 01:09:27,290
This place doesn't look
like a law office, okay?

612
01:09:27,390 --> 01:09:29,380
It looks like the set of
goddamn Sanford and Son.

613
01:09:29,490 --> 01:09:32,900
Every time I walk in, I'm waiting
for Lamont to walk down the stairs.

614
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:33,665
Then you go.

615
01:09:33,690 --> 01:09:35,684
Look at me, Matt. I'm
a "plus one," okay?

616
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:37,740
Plus ones don't get
anywhere by themselves.

617
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,000
They need somebody to bring them.
That's why it's "plus one."

618
01:09:40,110 --> 01:09:42,840
Are you finished? We only have
an hour to prepare for court.

619
01:09:42,940 --> 01:09:45,640
What's eating you?

620
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:50,410
I had a... a rough night.

621
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:54,610
Well, you wanna talk about it?

622
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:00,920
No.

623
01:10:02,130 --> 01:10:05,360
- It's about Elektra, isn't it?
- No.

624
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:07,532
Natchios owns the Grand
Hotel, and Elektra's

625
01:10:07,557 --> 01:10:09,444
the reason you were
invited to the ball.

626
01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:14,470
She's outta my league. I'd rather
just end it before it starts.

627
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:20,040
That's gotta be some
kind of record.

628
01:10:20,150 --> 01:10:22,480
You just completely bypassed
the whole relationship phase.

629
01:10:22,580 --> 01:10:25,880
You went right to the breakup.
Tryin' to save some time, huh?

630
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:29,610
What happens to that lie detector of
yours when it detects your own bullshit?

631
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:32,020
It must really bury
the needle, huh?

632
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:36,620
Swish.

633
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:40,690
Look, Matt, seriously, the
ball's in your court.

634
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:48,200
Plus one, huh?

635
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:53,240
Thank you.

636
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:59,250
This is what I'm talking about.
Aren't you happy you listened to me?

637
01:10:59,350 --> 01:11:02,290
This is gonna be great
for business, Matt.

638
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:04,050
Thank you.

639
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:07,020
Matt Murdock. Ben
Urich, New York Post.

640
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:10,150
Ben Urich. Nice to meet you.
You're the guy...

641
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:12,192
...who writes the articles
about the urban legends, right?

642
01:11:12,817 --> 01:11:15,194
Well, yes, among other things.

643
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:17,170
Maybe you could settle
something for us.

644
01:11:17,270 --> 01:11:19,290
You know the alligators
that live in the sewers?

645
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:20,183
My partner...

646
01:11:20,208 --> 01:11:22,555
I've been following that piece
you wrote about the Kingpin.

647
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:25,670
One man running all the
crime in New York City's...

648
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:27,680
It sounds a little
farfetched, doesn't it?

649
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:32,050
Well, yeah. But then again so's a vigilante
who thinks every day is Halloween.

650
01:11:33,350 --> 01:11:35,480
They got to be huge by now,
right, the alligators?

651
01:11:36,590 --> 01:11:39,020
It's a myth.

652
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:44,150
Look, uh, I'd like you to
give me a call... Sorry.

653
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,870
- Cool color.
- I wouldn't know.

654
01:11:51,970 --> 01:11:56,670
But do give me a call. There is something
I'd like to talk to you about.

655
01:11:58,710 --> 01:12:00,910
Nice to meet you.
Enjoy the party.

656
01:12:01,010 --> 01:12:05,750
Uh, uh, uh. Look at that. Wilson
Fisk is in the "hizzie."

657
01:12:05,850 --> 01:12:09,580
Come on. We might never get a chance like
this again. Come on, let's go. Come on.

658
01:12:09,690 --> 01:12:11,590
- We should talk about this...
- Mr. Fisk.

659
01:12:11,690 --> 01:12:15,130
Mr. Fisk, it's, uh, uh, Franklin
Nelson from Nelson & Murdock...

660
01:12:15,230 --> 01:12:19,960
Excuse me. Yeah, you want to talk to Mr.
Fisk, you make an appointment. Okay?

661
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:23,690
Wesley. I know who you are.

662
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:26,240
You're the blind lawyers
from Hell's Kitchen.

663
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:29,140
Actually... Actually,
he's the blind one.

664
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:31,370
I'm deaf.

665
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:34,040
Give 'em a card, Wesley.

666
01:12:34,150 --> 01:12:36,640
I'm always on the
lookout for new blood.

667
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:40,810
I'm sorry, Mr. Fisk. My partner is a little
overzealous. We can't represent you.

668
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:43,820
Why is that?

669
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,910
Yes, why is that, Mr. Murdock?

670
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:50,550
Because we only handle
clients who are innocent.

671
01:12:50,660 --> 01:12:55,070
Innocent, he says.
That's pretty funny.

672
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:57,800
You know, I've learned one thing
in all my years in this business.

673
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:00,770
- What's that?
- Nobody's innocent.

674
01:13:02,310 --> 01:13:04,570
Nobody.

675
01:13:06,710 --> 01:13:09,410
- Have a great time at the party.
- Thank you.

676
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:13,610
I just, you know... Matt, for
one night, I just wish...

677
01:13:14,850 --> 01:13:16,820
I just...

678
01:13:18,290 --> 01:13:21,090
Matt, I just wish I could give
you my eyes for one night.

679
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:25,690
- It's like that?
- It's like that.

680
01:13:29,430 --> 01:13:32,700
You want me to take you
up there, Matt? Matt?

681
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:34,770
Matt?

682
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:18,980
Now I found you.

683
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:23,620
Look, I'm really sorry
about the other night.

684
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:26,250
You're here now.

685
01:14:28,460 --> 01:14:30,690
That's all that matters.

686
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:34,700
Wow. Engraved cufflinks, huh?

687
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,169
Because it's Wesley Owen
Welch, it's your...

688
01:14:36,170 --> 01:14:39,500
Let me cut to the chase, OK? If this
were up to me... and it is...

689
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:43,300
Do you really think that for one moment the
Fisk Corporation would actually hire...

690
01:14:43,410 --> 01:14:48,249
some pro bono, storefront Hell's Kitchen
lawyers, let alone a blind one.

691
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:50,510
Come on. I've already filled...

692
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:54,480
our quota of handicapped
employees for the year.

693
01:14:54,590 --> 01:14:59,220
Go back to the Kitchen,
Franklin Nelson.

694
01:15:03,730 --> 01:15:05,750
What a dick.

695
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:08,830
D.

696
01:15:10,870 --> 01:15:13,570
You look beautiful tonight.

697
01:15:20,950 --> 01:15:22,970
Do you mind?

698
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:28,280
Uh, no. I just... Sometimes it makes
people uncomfortable, that's all.

699
01:15:29,990 --> 01:15:32,250
Not me.

700
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:36,090
But you should know...

701
01:15:36,190 --> 01:15:39,600
that the only reason I got
dressed up for this thing...

702
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:42,900
was that I wanted to
look beautiful for you.

703
01:15:45,870 --> 01:15:47,840
I wish you could see me tonight.

704
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:51,110
Me too.

705
01:15:57,780 --> 01:16:01,340
- Matt.
- What's wrong?

706
01:16:01,450 --> 01:16:03,420
Uh, it's just...

707
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:07,150
...good things don't happen
to me very often.

708
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:09,520
When they do, I get scared.

709
01:16:11,130 --> 01:16:14,000
Nothing bad is gonna happen.

710
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:16,090
I promise.

711
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:32,140
Hi. Hello.

712
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:34,220
Hello.

713
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:39,420
Hello.

714
01:16:46,630 --> 01:16:49,100
Oh, doesn't she look beautiful?

715
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:51,500
I think she's happy.

716
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:55,560
I haven't seen her smile like that
since before her mother was killed.

717
01:16:55,670 --> 01:16:59,200
Poor girl. Right in
front of her eyes.

718
01:16:59,310 --> 01:17:01,300
Why do you have to
bring that up now?

719
01:17:01,410 --> 01:17:04,870
History has a way of
repeating itself.

720
01:17:04,980 --> 01:17:09,040
- What are you saying?
- I'm just saying good-bye, old friend.

721
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:14,320
I'm just saying good-bye.

722
01:17:19,930 --> 01:17:21,900
Gus.

723
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:31,300
- Something's happening.
- What is it?

724
01:17:31,324 --> 01:17:33,024
Papa!

725
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:36,241
Go back to the party.

726
01:17:36,466 --> 01:17:37,394
[Speaking in Greek]
What's happening?

727
01:17:37,418 --> 01:17:38,379
What's wrong?

728
01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:41,339
[Speaking in Greek] Elektra!
Stay with him!

729
01:17:41,364 --> 01:17:43,374
Stavros will take you home.

730
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:46,620
Papa? Papa?

731
01:17:46,644 --> 01:17:48,829
[Speaking in Greek] We have to...

732
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:49,450
- Tell me where you're going.

733
01:17:49,474 --> 01:17:51,474
[Speaking in Greek] Please, stop it!

734
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,860
You wait... Ooh!

735
01:17:53,884 --> 01:17:57,984
[Speaking in Greek] Kostas, go back
and look for Fiss! Do it, fast, now!

736
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:01,570
I'm sorry.

737
01:18:39,194 --> 01:18:40,094
[Speaking in Greek] You're lying to me..

738
01:18:40,518 --> 01:18:41,749
[Speaking in Greek]
Everything's fine...

739
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:43,396
What is going on? Tell me.

740
01:18:43,421 --> 01:18:46,504
New York is not a safe place
tonight, that's all you have to know.

741
01:19:08,170 --> 01:19:11,270
Watch out!

742
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:33,730
I missed. I never miss.

743
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:03,460
Drop somethin'?

744
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:30,750
Bullseye, huh?

745
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:14,690
Daddy.

746
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:37,310
Get that over to
Forensics right away.

747
01:21:37,420 --> 01:21:38,713
Hey, Nick?

748
01:21:38,738 --> 01:21:42,615
What do you want, Urich?
Does all this make you happy?

749
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:47,660
Looks like you got your story.

750
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:28,360
Police are still investigating the
murder of Greek shipping heir...

751
01:22:28,370 --> 01:22:31,770
...identifying Nikolas Natchios as
the so-called Kingpin of crime...

752
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:34,570
...the self-styled vigilante
is wanted for murder.

753
01:22:34,594 --> 01:22:36,594
...to the implication of Daredevil...

754
01:22:40,890 --> 01:22:43,290
Now, how did you get
past my security?

755
01:22:43,390 --> 01:22:45,290
Oh, you mean that guy?

756
01:22:47,890 --> 01:22:49,550
Was that really necessary?

757
01:22:49,660 --> 01:22:51,630
Necessary, no. It was fun.

758
01:22:52,730 --> 01:22:57,060
You know, you've exceeded
all my expectations.

759
01:22:57,170 --> 01:23:00,140
You even managed to implicate
Daredevil in the process.

760
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:02,140
You should be pleased.

761
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:05,680
He... made me...

762
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:09,580
...miss.

763
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:14,910
There's an old saying that "too
much pride can kill a man."

764
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:21,760
The Devil is mine.

765
01:23:21,860 --> 01:23:25,090
Really? I've heard
that before...

766
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:27,820
...all too many times.

767
01:23:27,930 --> 01:23:29,830
But answer me this.

768
01:23:29,930 --> 01:23:33,230
How do you kill a
man without fear?

769
01:23:33,340 --> 01:23:36,830
By puttin' the fear in him.

770
01:23:36,940 --> 01:23:40,840
Ah. I like that. But first...

771
01:23:46,150 --> 01:23:48,910
...give Elektra all my best.

772
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:51,110
Is there anything else?

773
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:54,350
Yeah.

774
01:23:56,730 --> 01:23:59,700
I want a fuckin' costume.

775
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:07,670
And what happened from
there, Mr. Jackson?

776
01:24:07,770 --> 01:24:09,760
Well, let's see, uh...

777
01:24:09,870 --> 01:24:14,370
Man, I was so high, I can't
remember everything.

778
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:21,150
Excuse me one second, Your Honor,
I'm working alone here today.

779
01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:23,850
Just a second.

780
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:31,790
It's braille. It's braille.

781
01:24:33,930 --> 01:24:35,599
It says here, okay...

782
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:38,230
Mr. Jackson, it says
here that you were...

783
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:41,640
at Chumley's Tavern
until 10:15...

784
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:44,000
and then you went
to meet a friend.

785
01:24:44,110 --> 01:24:46,080
Turk!

786
01:24:46,180 --> 01:24:48,964
I went to meet Turk because

787
01:24:48,989 --> 01:24:50,674
- he owed me some money.
- Yes!

788
01:24:50,750 --> 01:24:53,620
And it was there that you passed out
from drinking, is that correct?

789
01:24:55,290 --> 01:24:57,880
Smoking weed, mostly.

790
01:25:00,790 --> 01:25:01,780
Thank you for clarifying that.

791
01:25:01,790 --> 01:25:04,953
Now, Officer McKensie
has testified that you

792
01:25:04,978 --> 01:25:06,744
were found at that time
holding a handgun?

793
01:25:06,830 --> 01:25:07,805
That's a lie!

794
01:25:07,830 --> 01:25:10,754
In fact, you don't even
own a handgun, do you?

795
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:11,555
No, sir.

796
01:25:11,780 --> 01:25:13,924
Have you ever owned a
handgun, Mr. Jackson?

797
01:25:13,925 --> 01:25:15,033
No, sir.

798
01:25:15,858 --> 01:25:18,525
Do you have any intention
of owning a handgun, Mr. Jackson?

799
01:25:18,610 --> 01:25:20,940
- No, sir.
- Thank you.

800
01:25:21,050 --> 01:25:24,500
- Can't hit nothin' with a handgun.
- Thank you.

801
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:27,240
But a shotgun, now that's
a whole different story.

802
01:25:27,350 --> 01:25:28,764
Shotgun got buckshot...

803
01:25:28,789 --> 01:25:30,128
- ...just like little pellets.
- Thank you. That's all.

804
01:25:30,190 --> 01:25:31,769
...and when you shoot 'em,
they kinda spray out, like that,

805
01:25:31,794 --> 01:25:33,304
so you can just hit
everything in front of...

806
01:25:34,190 --> 01:25:37,060
Thank you, Mr. Jackson. I have no
further questions, Your Honor.

807
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:39,120
Court's in recess!

808
01:25:40,730 --> 01:25:43,790
Mr. Nelson.

809
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:49,770
For your sake, I hope your
partner comes back soon.

810
01:25:49,870 --> 01:25:52,840
Me too. Me too.

811
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,730
- I know how you feel.
- You don't know how I feel.

812
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:53,930
I want revenge.

813
01:26:56,140 --> 01:27:01,480
Revenge won't make the pain go away.
Trust me. I know.

814
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:10,580
- There's no place for me now.
- Yes, there is.

815
01:27:11,890 --> 01:27:15,850
Stay. Stay with me.

816
01:27:17,830 --> 01:27:19,990
Please.

817
01:27:55,730 --> 01:27:57,960
Elektra. Elektra, wait.

818
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:01,700
Please.

819
01:28:15,650 --> 01:28:17,880
Drive.

820
01:28:45,350 --> 01:28:48,380
- Matt.
- Why are you following me?

821
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:51,820
- It's Ben Urich.
- I know who it is.

822
01:28:58,700 --> 01:29:01,130
What do you want?

823
01:29:01,230 --> 01:29:03,290
Your client's innocent.

824
01:29:16,810 --> 01:29:18,840
Well?

825
01:29:18,950 --> 01:29:24,650
I had a source from my Kingpin
story named Lisa Tazio.

826
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:28,280
- Lisa Tazio had access to the Kingpin?
- No.

827
01:29:28,390 --> 01:29:30,690
One of his guys... pillow talk.

828
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:33,960
She was selling me information bit by bit.
I never got a name.

829
01:29:34,070 --> 01:29:36,060
Will you testify to that?

830
01:29:36,170 --> 01:29:38,974
Well, First Amendment
and all that,

831
01:29:38,999 --> 01:29:40,854
plus the case is still open, as
far as I am concerned.

832
01:29:40,940 --> 01:29:44,100
Is there anything that you can
tell me that will help my client?

833
01:29:44,110 --> 01:29:48,600
Yeah, I got a cousin over in
Hoboken, runs a Mercedes dealership.

834
01:29:49,410 --> 01:29:52,910
He sold a 500 SL...
to a Robert McKensie.

835
01:29:55,190 --> 01:29:57,380
Officer McKensie.

836
01:29:57,690 --> 01:29:59,109
That doesn't make sense.
He was telling the truth.

837
01:29:59,534 --> 01:30:00,704
Matt.

838
01:30:01,890 --> 01:30:06,220
That's three years cop's salary.
The guy ain't tellin' the truth.

839
01:30:15,310 --> 01:30:18,830
What about our future? Our future...
Our children...

840
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:33,820
Hey.

841
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:37,655
Gotta love that new car
smell, huh, McKensie?

842
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:38,954
Murdock, what the fuck...?

843
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:48,300
Never driven one of these stick-shifts
before. How does this work?

844
01:30:48,310 --> 01:30:48,975
Stop it!

845
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,994
Take it easy, McKensie,
we'll go for a ride.

846
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:54,640
- This is a nice car. Where'd you get this?
- Lots of cops got Mercedes, these days!

847
01:30:54,750 --> 01:30:57,210
Yeah? I bet.

848
01:30:59,650 --> 01:31:02,780
Jesus Christ! You're crazy.

849
01:31:02,890 --> 01:31:05,220
Yeah, I'm crazy. Who
killed Lisa Tazio?

850
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:07,020
Daunte Jackson.

851
01:31:10,590 --> 01:31:12,320
Stop the goddamn car!

852
01:31:12,430 --> 01:31:15,660
Here's the hard part... parallel parking.
How is it? Like this?

853
01:31:19,170 --> 01:31:20,930
What do you want?

854
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:24,500
I want to know why your goddamn
heart rate hasn't changed!

855
01:31:29,410 --> 01:31:31,900
Shit.

856
01:31:32,020 --> 01:31:36,420
- When'd you get the pacemaker?
- Three years ago. So what?

857
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:38,680
You lied in court.
That's perjury.

858
01:31:38,790 --> 01:31:41,450
You think I'm the only one?

859
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:45,260
You take me down, there's a hundred
more just like me to take my place.

860
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:49,530
This is bigger than you, Murdock.
It's bigger than all of us.

861
01:31:49,630 --> 01:31:52,190
The Kingpin.

862
01:31:52,300 --> 01:31:55,500
He runs the whole goddamn town.

863
01:31:55,610 --> 01:31:57,600
You cross him, you're gonna
end up like Natchios...

864
01:31:57,710 --> 01:32:00,470
eighty-sixed by some
maniac like Bullseye...

865
01:32:00,580 --> 01:32:03,070
and he won't stop there.

866
01:32:03,180 --> 01:32:07,380
- What does that mean?
- Kingpin doesn't just kill you...

867
01:32:07,490 --> 01:32:09,780
he kills your whole family.

868
01:32:26,370 --> 01:32:29,130
I have coffee.

869
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:31,400
Did you get ahold of Matt?

870
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:35,540
No. He'll call. Don't worry.

871
01:32:36,850 --> 01:32:39,250
- You should really get home, Karen.
- I'm fine.

872
01:32:39,350 --> 01:32:42,440
- How are you doing?
- Oh, me? I'm great.

873
01:32:42,950 --> 01:32:46,634
I'm making.. hum...
ridiculously little progress...

874
01:32:46,659 --> 01:32:49,474
for the amount of time
I've invested in this.

875
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:51,050
Is your mom coming to town?

876
01:32:51,060 --> 01:32:53,590
- My mom? No.
- What's that note?

877
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:57,790
Oh, that? That's Matt's big
contribution to the Tazio case...

878
01:32:57,900 --> 01:33:01,200
which has surprisingly turned
out to be completely useless.

879
01:33:01,310 --> 01:33:03,140
Mm.

880
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:06,210
What's the date of the murder?

881
01:33:07,310 --> 01:33:09,370
August 9th. Why?

882
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:14,680
Maybe you're looking at it wrong?
August 9th.

883
01:33:24,030 --> 01:33:28,470
"August 9th. WOW." WOW.

884
01:33:28,570 --> 01:33:30,560
WOW, WOW, WOW.

885
01:33:30,670 --> 01:33:33,030
WOW, WOW, WOW, WOW.

886
01:33:33,140 --> 01:33:36,540
Wesley Owen Welch.

887
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:39,170
Son of a bitch.

888
01:33:43,380 --> 01:33:45,350
Oh, cha-ching.

889
01:33:46,620 --> 01:33:48,590
This better be good, Kirby.

890
01:33:50,860 --> 01:33:53,920
You know me, Urich.
It's always good.

891
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:12,370
Okay. Are you ready to see
something really, really cool?

892
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:15,540
- Come on.
- Okay.

893
01:34:17,050 --> 01:34:19,040
Ta-da!

894
01:34:21,290 --> 01:34:23,450
Oh, come on, man. I'm
throwin'you gold.

895
01:34:23,550 --> 01:34:24,812
- Give me my money.
- Why?

896
01:34:24,837 --> 01:34:26,204
- I've seen it. Come on.

897
01:34:26,290 --> 01:34:29,190
All right. Well, but
have you seen this?

898
01:34:36,270 --> 01:34:39,400
And tighty-righty, loosey-lefty.

899
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:44,670
You said look out for
anything weird, yes?

900
01:34:46,510 --> 01:34:49,670
Well, it's some pretty weird
shit right here, man, right?

901
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:54,140
You have no idea.

902
01:35:01,730 --> 01:35:04,750
- Yeah.
- Yeah, this is Franklin Nelson.

903
01:35:05,860 --> 01:35:07,920
Uh, this is not a good time.

904
01:35:08,030 --> 01:35:10,090
It's about Lisa Tazio.

905
01:38:06,980 --> 01:38:09,540
Remember me?

906
01:38:09,650 --> 01:38:11,740
No. Wait.

907
01:38:12,850 --> 01:38:15,820
It wasn't me.

908
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:19,880
It was a hitman named Bullseye.

909
01:38:21,990 --> 01:38:25,450
- I didn't kill your father.
- Liar.

910
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:05,100
- I'm not going to fight you.
- Good. Then this will be quick.

911
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:38,530
I want to look into the eyes of
my father's killer as he dies.

912
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:40,900
Wait. Wait.

913
01:39:46,610 --> 01:39:49,240
Now you know.

914
01:39:50,510 --> 01:39:54,880
- Oh, God.
- I was... just trying to protect you...

915
01:39:54,990 --> 01:39:57,040
...um, Elektra.

916
01:39:57,150 --> 01:39:59,150
I'm sorry.

917
01:40:03,590 --> 01:40:08,330
That's him. That's Bullseye.
Listen to me.

918
01:40:08,430 --> 01:40:10,530
- You have to run.
- He has to pay for what he's done.

919
01:40:10,630 --> 01:40:12,600
No. You have to...

920
01:40:12,700 --> 01:40:14,600
I don't want to lose you again.

921
01:40:16,310 --> 01:40:18,930
I'll find you.

922
01:40:21,680 --> 01:40:23,650
Come on, girl!

923
01:40:40,360 --> 01:40:44,860
Hey, orphan. Let's play.

924
01:40:51,580 --> 01:40:53,600
Nice. Come on.

925
01:41:02,990 --> 01:41:04,950
Ohh.

926
01:41:08,630 --> 01:41:10,560
Oh.

927
01:42:15,090 --> 01:42:18,090
You're good, baby.
I'll give you that.

928
01:42:18,700 --> 01:42:20,160
But me?

929
01:42:23,130 --> 01:42:25,860
I'm magic.

930
01:42:50,990 --> 01:42:53,120
Now for my next trick.

931
01:42:55,770 --> 01:42:59,530
No! No!

932
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:23,759
N.Y.P.D. Aviation.

933
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:28,030
Police, do not move! Get on your knees
and put your hands on your head.

934
01:43:28,830 --> 01:43:34,430
I repeat. Get on your knees and
put your hands on your head.

935
01:43:56,090 --> 01:43:58,060
Help me.

936
01:44:00,660 --> 01:44:03,130
Stay... Stay with me.

937
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,900
Everything clear.

938
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:13,430
Matthew. Matthew.

939
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:16,770
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

940
01:45:20,280 --> 01:45:22,580
This is my confession, Father.

941
01:45:22,680 --> 01:45:26,910
God's mercy is infinite.
All ya gotta do is ask.

942
01:45:27,020 --> 01:45:29,180
Everything I had has
been taken from me.

943
01:45:31,250 --> 01:45:33,450
Now I'm supposed
to ask for mercy.

944
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:36,690
I don't ask for mercy...
people ask me.

945
01:45:36,790 --> 01:45:38,890
Oh, is that a fact?

946
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:47,400
First one's a warning...

947
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:50,940
Padre.

948
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:52,940
Is there a back
door out of here?

949
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:55,030
- Yeah.
- Take it. Call the police.

950
01:45:55,150 --> 01:45:57,410
What about you?

951
01:45:57,510 --> 01:46:00,920
- I have to finish this.
- But you can't fight like this, son.

952
01:46:01,020 --> 01:46:03,010
Have faith, Father.

953
01:46:03,120 --> 01:46:05,520
Isn't that right?

954
01:46:15,330 --> 01:46:19,130
You. Let's play.

955
01:47:58,870 --> 01:48:01,960
Caine, I want the blueprints
and the city grids.

956
01:48:01,970 --> 01:48:03,270
- Secure the perimeter.
- Yes, sir.

957
01:48:03,294 --> 01:48:04,769
Where the hell is my SWAT team?!

958
01:48:04,770 --> 01:48:07,400
- The doors are locked from the inside, sir.
- Break 'em down.

959
01:48:07,510 --> 01:48:09,940
It's a church, sir.

960
01:48:10,050 --> 01:48:13,170
- Your point?
- Yes, sir.

961
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:15,980
- Let's get a battering ram in here now.
- You got it.

962
01:49:14,980 --> 01:49:17,850
Let's go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

963
01:49:17,950 --> 01:49:20,850
- Hey, Coyle, keep 'em in your sights.
- Which one?

964
01:49:20,950 --> 01:49:24,980
- Both of'em! I want a man on that roof!
- Ready?

965
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:29,080
Man without fear.

966
01:49:29,190 --> 01:49:33,030
Looks like I found
somethin'you're afraid of.

967
01:49:33,130 --> 01:49:35,190
Let's bring on the pain.

968
01:49:38,470 --> 01:49:40,440
Let's bring on the noise.

969
01:49:54,220 --> 01:49:58,120
Fisk was right about you. He
said you wouldn't go easy.

970
01:49:58,220 --> 01:50:01,710
Fisk? Fisk is the Kingpin?

971
01:50:01,830 --> 01:50:03,160
Yeah.

972
01:50:04,260 --> 01:50:06,730
The whole red rose thing?
He loves that shite.

973
01:50:06,830 --> 01:50:08,960
It's not my style.

974
01:50:16,170 --> 01:50:18,070
He hired me to kill Natchios.

975
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:21,610
And to gut your pretty
girlfriend too.

976
01:50:24,180 --> 01:50:26,150
But me, I'm goin'
for the hat trick.

977
01:50:27,380 --> 01:50:29,720
I told him I'd do you for free.

978
01:50:35,430 --> 01:50:38,260
The Devil is mine.

979
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:54,810
Oh, my hands! My hands!

980
01:50:59,620 --> 01:51:02,350
You took away my hands.

981
01:51:02,450 --> 01:51:04,980
Show mercy.

982
01:51:19,900 --> 01:51:21,930
Whoa!

983
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:30,310
Bull's-eye.

984
01:51:30,410 --> 01:51:32,470
- Freeze!
- Whoa!

985
01:51:32,580 --> 01:51:34,680
Don't move! Don't move!

986
01:51:34,780 --> 01:51:38,020
- Stay on him! Stay on him! Stay on him!
- Detective, look!

987
01:51:44,590 --> 01:51:46,930
Good luck, son.

988
01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:53,530
There's been a problem.

989
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:57,130
- Bullseye failed.
- Correct.

990
01:51:57,240 --> 01:51:59,870
Then he'll be coming here next.

991
01:51:59,980 --> 01:52:03,410
- Why would you say that?
- Because that's what I would do.

992
01:52:03,510 --> 01:52:06,380
Well, then we'll be
ready for him, sir.

993
01:52:10,290 --> 01:52:12,190
Send the guards home.

994
01:52:12,290 --> 01:52:15,990
- B-But, sir...
- I was raised in the Bronx, Wesley.

995
01:52:16,090 --> 01:52:18,580
This is something you
wouldn't understand.

996
01:52:21,100 --> 01:52:23,120
Yes, sir.

997
01:52:31,840 --> 01:52:34,040
- I have to talk to you.
- Give me a break, Urich.

998
01:52:34,140 --> 01:52:37,240
- Doors are open, Detective.
- Terrific. Just in time.

999
01:52:37,350 --> 01:52:40,110
- Freddy, keep those people back!
- You're gonna wanna hear this.

1000
01:52:40,220 --> 01:52:42,680
I just got an anonymous
tip on the Tazio murder.

1001
01:52:42,790 --> 01:52:45,450
Phone it into the station. I got
much bigger problems tonight.

1002
01:52:45,560 --> 01:52:48,220
It leads to Wilson Fisk.

1003
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:50,880
Nick, he's the Kingpin
and I can prove it.

1004
01:52:50,990 --> 01:52:53,460
Come on. You got
nothin' on Fisk.

1005
01:52:53,560 --> 01:52:57,190
No, but I got the guy that does.

1006
01:52:59,670 --> 01:53:01,570
Would you care for
another martini, sir?

1007
01:53:01,670 --> 01:53:04,730
No, I come here for
the view, asshole.

1008
01:53:06,610 --> 01:53:09,640
- Wesley Owen Welch?
- Who wants to know?

1009
01:53:09,750 --> 01:53:12,150
Detective Nick Manolis.

1010
01:53:12,250 --> 01:53:15,270
I'd like to talk to you about
the murder of Lisa Tazio.

1011
01:53:15,390 --> 01:53:17,510
I want my lawyer.

1012
01:53:17,620 --> 01:53:19,850
I haven't charged
you with anything.

1013
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:22,550
I won't talk to you without
my lawyer present.

1014
01:53:23,990 --> 01:53:27,220
All right, then I'll
talk, you listen...

1015
01:53:27,330 --> 01:53:30,200
and then we can talk
about your plea bargain.

1016
01:53:35,810 --> 01:53:37,830
Check.

1017
01:54:23,650 --> 01:54:26,140
Daredevil.

1018
01:54:26,260 --> 01:54:28,220
Kingpin.

1019
01:55:32,390 --> 01:55:34,290
Mmm.

1020
01:55:34,390 --> 01:55:36,880
It's a shame you
came here wounded.

1021
01:55:38,130 --> 01:55:41,150
I would have loved to
fight you in your prime.

1022
01:55:43,230 --> 01:55:46,360
They call you the
man without fear.

1023
01:55:47,900 --> 01:55:52,240
If that's true, why are you
afraid to show your face?

1024
01:55:54,580 --> 01:55:57,410
I don't believe it.

1025
01:55:57,510 --> 01:56:00,070
No. No. No.

1026
01:56:00,180 --> 01:56:03,910
The blind lawyer
from Hell's Kitchen?

1027
01:56:05,790 --> 01:56:09,090
You killed the only two
people I ever loved.

1028
01:56:10,130 --> 01:56:12,090
Why?

1029
01:56:14,260 --> 01:56:16,700
Business.

1030
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:19,430
It's all it ever
is, is business.

1031
01:56:19,540 --> 01:56:22,300
I was working for
Fallon at the time.

1032
01:56:22,410 --> 01:56:24,930
Your father was supposed
to throw a fight.

1033
01:56:25,040 --> 01:56:26,940
And your girl...

1034
01:56:27,040 --> 01:56:32,000
was in the wrong family
at the wrong time.

1035
01:56:32,110 --> 01:56:34,780
It's all business.

1036
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:37,220
I'll find you.

1037
01:56:37,320 --> 01:56:40,550
And you've been in my
business for too long.

1038
01:57:40,350 --> 01:57:44,580
I've been thinking about this
day since I was 12 years old.

1039
01:58:12,420 --> 01:58:14,540
I don't understand.

1040
01:58:20,860 --> 01:58:23,320
I'm not the bad guy.

1041
01:58:26,330 --> 01:58:28,160
You hear that, blind man?

1042
01:58:28,860 --> 01:58:31,430
Sirens.

1043
01:58:32,130 --> 01:58:33,430
They're coming for you.

1044
01:58:34,140 --> 01:58:35,830
For me?

1045
01:58:36,340 --> 01:58:40,500
Didn't you hear? The
word's out on the Kingpin.

1046
01:58:40,610 --> 01:58:44,770
They're coming for you. I can
hear the police radios from here.

1047
01:58:44,880 --> 01:58:49,820
No. No. I swear, I'll
tell them who you are.

1048
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:51,890
Yeah? Go ahead.

1049
01:58:51,990 --> 01:58:57,450
Tell 'em. Tell the guys at Rikers all
about how you got beat by a blind man.

1050
01:58:59,330 --> 01:59:01,520
It'll be like blood
in the water.

1051
01:59:01,630 --> 01:59:06,730
Oh. Don't worry about that.
'Cause I'll get out.

1052
01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:08,800
Yeah. I know.

1053
01:59:11,240 --> 01:59:13,470
And I'll be waiting.

1054
01:59:16,980 --> 01:59:18,970
Justice is served.

1055
01:59:27,560 --> 01:59:28,660
I'll get you.

1056
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:30,520
I'll get you.

1057
01:59:32,530 --> 01:59:34,460
It's not over with yet.

1058
01:59:37,770 --> 01:59:40,330
It's not over with yet.

1059
01:59:52,180 --> 01:59:54,340
This is for you, Dad.

1060
02:00:15,500 --> 02:00:16,603
Congratulations.

1061
02:00:16,828 --> 02:00:19,935
Thank you, Mr. Murdock.
I appreciate everything, man.

1062
02:00:20,010 --> 02:00:22,100
- Seriously, congratulations.
- You the man.

1063
02:00:22,210 --> 02:00:24,510
All right. Yeah.
Keep it real. All right.

1064
02:00:24,610 --> 02:00:26,580
I appreciate everything, man.

1065
02:00:26,680 --> 02:00:28,309
I'm feelin' you, man. You
know what I'm sayin'?

1066
02:00:28,334 --> 02:00:30,244
If you ever need anything, come
down to 117th Street...

1067
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:33,310
I'll do that. Thank you.

1068
02:00:33,420 --> 02:00:35,119
- That's it, dog.
- You stuck by me.

1069
02:00:35,120 --> 02:00:36,390
- That's it, dog.
- You stuck by me.

1070
02:00:36,490 --> 02:00:40,220
Nobody wouldn't touch me
with a 20,000 foot pole.

1071
02:00:40,330 --> 02:00:42,090
- Oh.
- All right.

1072
02:00:42,100 --> 02:00:44,268
I could cry right now. You're
like a brother to me, man.

1073
02:00:44,293 --> 02:00:45,954
You know what I'm sayin'?
...

1074
02:00:46,440 --> 02:00:49,170
"Police say that although
there were no eyewitnesses...

1075
02:00:49,270 --> 02:00:52,040
they suspect Daredevil was the
one to bring Fisk to justice."

1076
02:00:52,140 --> 02:00:53,840
Wait a minute, did you hear that?
There were no eyewitnesses.

1077
02:00:53,940 --> 02:00:56,740
It's in black and white.
How can you be a skeptic?

1078
02:00:56,850 --> 02:00:59,680
If there's no eyewitness... I mean,
you know, Bigfoot has eyewitnesses.

1079
02:00:59,780 --> 02:01:02,080
- Oh, please.
- The alligators in the sewers.

1080
02:01:02,180 --> 02:01:04,380
Oh the alligators?! So you're saying
there are alligators in the sewers?

1081
02:01:04,490 --> 02:01:04,973
No.

1082
02:01:04,998 --> 02:01:06,045
So you're changing your
position on this one.

1083
02:01:06,069 --> 02:01:07,619
- I'm explaining to you...
- Do you or do you not

1084
02:01:07,620 --> 02:01:10,489
concede that there are
alligators in the sewers?

1085
02:01:10,490 --> 02:01:11,989
Please answer the question.

1086
02:01:11,990 --> 02:01:15,730
- No, I don't...
- How can you not concede? You won't...

1087
02:01:19,600 --> 02:01:21,030
Judy, we're over here!

1088
02:01:28,210 --> 02:01:30,180
How you doin'?

1089
02:01:31,810 --> 02:01:35,110
- I'm doin' okay. I'll be all right.
- You want to talk about it?

1090
02:01:35,220 --> 02:01:38,350
No. But thanks.

1091
02:01:41,990 --> 02:01:45,090
- I'm gonna get some air.
- I got this.

1092
02:01:45,190 --> 02:01:47,630
Thanks.

1093
02:02:05,010 --> 02:02:07,979
- Good to see you.
- Oh, you too. How are you?

1094
02:02:07,980 --> 02:02:10,210
Nice to see you.
Thank you very much.

1095
02:02:11,790 --> 02:02:13,690
Bueno. See you next week.

1096
02:02:20,230 --> 02:02:22,130
Well, maybe next
week, Matt, huh?

1097
02:02:22,230 --> 02:02:26,130
Maybe.

1098
02:02:34,240 --> 02:02:37,970
- Matt.
- Ben.

1099
02:02:40,180 --> 02:02:43,380
Promised my kids I'd quit.
Gum's gonna kill me quicker.

1100
02:02:45,350 --> 02:02:48,120
- How are you?
- I'm all right. I'm good.

1101
02:02:48,220 --> 02:02:53,220
- Thank you.
- Well, don't thank me so quick.

1102
02:02:53,330 --> 02:02:56,770
You see, there's this other
story I been workin' on.

1103
02:02:56,870 --> 02:02:59,390
I wanted to tell you about
it before it hit the paper.

1104
02:03:00,900 --> 02:03:03,270
I know the truth
about Daredevil.

1105
02:03:03,370 --> 02:03:06,770
Justice is blind.

1106
02:03:09,010 --> 02:03:13,570
Ben, if you run that story...

1107
02:03:13,680 --> 02:03:15,840
...I'm finished.

1108
02:03:21,190 --> 02:03:24,160
But I'm a reporter, kid.

1109
02:03:24,260 --> 02:03:26,960
It's what I do.

1110
02:03:32,640 --> 02:03:34,870
<i>Violence doesn't discriminate.</i>

1111
02:03:34,970 --> 02:03:37,910
<i>It hits all of us...</i>

1112
02:03:41,140 --> 02:03:43,980
<i>rich, poor, healthy, sick.</i>

1113
02:03:44,480 --> 02:03:50,149
<i>It comes as cold and bracing as
a winter breeze off the Hudson.</i>

1114
02:03:50,150 --> 02:03:53,320
<i>Until it sinks
into your bones...</i>

1115
02:03:53,420 --> 02:03:56,260
<i>leaving you with a
chill you can't shake.</i>

1116
02:04:09,440 --> 02:04:13,070
<i>They say there's no
rest for the wicked.</i>

1117
02:04:13,180 --> 02:04:16,040
<i>But what about the good?</i>

1118
02:04:18,810 --> 02:04:21,980
<i>The battle of good versus
evil is never-ending...</i>

1119
02:04:26,260 --> 02:04:29,090
<i>because evil always survives...</i>

1120
02:04:29,190 --> 02:04:33,750
- Bull's-eye.
<i>with the help of evil men.</i>

1121
02:05:13,200 --> 02:05:15,800
Braille.

1122
02:05:45,400 --> 02:05:48,730
<i>As for Daredevil, well...</i>

1123
02:05:50,110 --> 02:05:52,630
<i>soon the world will
know the truth...</i>

1124
02:05:58,810 --> 02:06:02,680
<i>that this is a city
born of heroes...</i>

1125
02:06:03,790 --> 02:06:06,620
<i>that one man can
make a difference.</i>

1126
02:06:25,670 --> 02:06:27,570
Go get 'em, Matt.

1127
02:06:28,980 --> 02:06:31,240
<i>Hell's Kitchen is
my neighborhood.</i>

1128
02:06:31,350 --> 02:06:34,710
<i>I prowl the rooftops and
alleyways at night...</i>

1129
02:06:34,820 --> 02:06:36,580
<i>watching from the darkness.</i>

1130
02:06:36,690 --> 02:06:38,980
<i>Forever in darkness.</i>

1131
02:06:41,960 --> 02:06:43,980
<i>A guardian devil.</i>
