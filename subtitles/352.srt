1
00:00:31,686 --> 00:00:35,775
Once upon a time, in deep winter,

2
00:00:35,775 --> 00:00:39,065
a queen was admiring the falling snow,

3
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:43,397
when she saw a rose blooming
in defiance of the cold.

4
00:00:43,718 --> 00:00:50,616
reaching for it she pricked her
finger, and three drops of blood fell.

5
00:00:53,545 --> 00:00:56,513
And because the red seemed
so alive against the white,

6
00:00:56,552 --> 00:01:00,604
she thought: "If only I had
a child as white as snow,

7
00:01:00,604 --> 00:01:04,654
lips as red as blood, hair
as black as a raven's wings,

8
00:01:04,654 --> 00:01:08,866
and all of the strength of that rose."

9
00:01:11,793 --> 00:01:18,571
Soon after a daughter was born to
the queen, and was named Snow White.

10
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,589
And she was adored
throughout the kingdom,

11
00:01:24,589 --> 00:01:27,837
as much for her defiant
spirit as for her beauty.

12
00:01:59,402 --> 00:02:03,935
We found it in the woods,
it's injured mother.

13
00:02:03,935 --> 00:02:07,024
It must have broken it's wing.

14
00:02:07,024 --> 00:02:11,355
- Don't worry, it will heal in time.
- I'll look after it.

15
00:02:11,355 --> 00:02:15,045
You posses a rare beauty my love.

16
00:02:15,045 --> 00:02:19,177
In here, never loose it.

17
00:02:19,177 --> 00:02:22,666
It will serve you well
when you become queen.

18
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:35,220
Careful you don't fall. - I'm just
getting you an apple, here you go.

19
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,428
Thank you. William!

20
00:02:38,428 --> 00:02:42,319
William!

21
00:02:44,846 --> 00:02:47,934
The next winter was
the harshest in memory.

22
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:51,344
Snow White's mother passed away.

23
00:02:52,226 --> 00:02:55,274
The king was inconsolable.

24
00:02:55,274 --> 00:02:58,282
Taking advantage of his
grief, a dark and mysterious

25
00:02:58,282 --> 00:03:03,296
army appeared and lured him into battle.

26
00:03:28,443 --> 00:03:32,054
- What devil spawned this army?!
- Send them back to hell!

27
00:03:32,054 --> 00:03:34,661
No prisoners!

28
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:42,043
Dark army was defeated, but what
would soon come to pass was far darker.

29
00:04:42,043 --> 00:04:45,854
Sire!

30
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,669
Prisoner.

31
00:04:54,397 --> 00:04:59,491
Fear not, you will come to
no harm from me or my men.

32
00:04:59,491 --> 00:05:01,777
What is your name milady?

33
00:05:04,424 --> 00:05:07,511
Ravenna, sire.

34
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:13,328
So enchanted by her beauty was the king,

35
00:05:13,328 --> 00:05:16,858
that he forgot for the
first time his broken heart.

36
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:21,750
And the very next day
she would become his wife.

37
00:05:22,352 --> 00:05:27,366
You're so beautiful.
- That's kind, child.

38
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:33,383
Especially when it is said that yours is
the face of true beauty in this kingdom.

39
00:05:33,383 --> 00:05:35,388
Come.

40
00:05:37,995 --> 00:05:40,601
This all must be difficult for you.

41
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:44,532
I too lost my mother
when I was a young girl.

42
00:05:44,532 --> 00:05:49,346
I can never take your
mother's place, never.

43
00:05:49,346 --> 00:05:53,356
But I feel that you and I are bound.

44
00:05:55,161 --> 00:06:00,937
I feel it there, your heart.

45
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:51,593
You will be the ruin of me.

46
00:06:51,593 --> 00:06:55,485
Indeed my lord.

47
00:06:58,332 --> 00:07:04,228
I was ruined by a king like you once.

48
00:07:05,231 --> 00:07:11,969
I replaced his queen, an old woman.

49
00:07:12,972 --> 00:07:18,547
And in time I too would
have been replaced.

50
00:07:18,587 --> 00:07:22,799
Men use women.

51
00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:29,216
They ruin us, and when
they are finished with us,

52
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:34,309
they toss us to their dogs like scraps.

53
00:07:35,032 --> 00:07:37,398
What have you given me?

54
00:07:37,438 --> 00:07:42,732
When a woman stays young and
beautiful forever, the world is hers.

55
00:07:44,739 --> 00:07:49,551
First I will take your life, my lord.

56
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,647
And then I'll take your throne.

57
00:08:30,382 --> 00:08:34,994
Welcome brother.
- My queen.

58
00:08:36,278 --> 00:08:40,088
She had tricked her way into the
kingdom with her phantom army.

59
00:08:40,088 --> 00:08:45,022
She now welcomed a very real one.

60
00:09:21,119 --> 00:09:24,408
William!
- Princess! No!

61
00:09:24,408 --> 00:09:27,417
Don't leave!

62
00:09:27,417 --> 00:09:29,903
Princess!

63
00:09:42,256 --> 00:09:45,184
William, don't leave me!

64
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:48,353
Father we must go back!

65
00:09:48,393 --> 00:09:52,203
We've lost her!
- No!

66
00:10:34,197 --> 00:10:37,004
Out.

67
00:10:37,727 --> 00:10:40,414
Out!

68
00:10:55,174 --> 00:11:00,147
Mirror, mirror, on the wall.

69
00:11:04,681 --> 00:11:08,891
Who is the fairest of them all?

70
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:48,679
It is you, my queen.

71
00:11:48,719 --> 00:11:53,211
Yet another kingdom falls to your glory.

72
00:11:53,211 --> 00:11:59,428
Is there no end to
your power and beauty?

73
00:12:05,645 --> 00:12:08,853
So poisonous was the reign of Ravenna,

74
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:12,984
that nature turned on itself,
and people turned on each other.

75
00:12:12,984 --> 00:12:18,679
The land died, and with it, hope.

76
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,372
And all that time she
kept Snow White imprisoned,

77
00:12:23,412 --> 00:12:25,898
high up in the north tower.

78
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:31,998
Our Father, Who art in
heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name.

79
00:13:31,998 --> 00:13:35,006
Thy Kingdom come. Thy Will be
done, on earth as it is in Heaven.

80
00:13:35,006 --> 00:13:37,332
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our sins,

81
00:13:37,332 --> 00:13:39,698
as we forgive those
who sin against us.

82
00:13:39,698 --> 00:13:44,511
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil. Amen.

83
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,657
Hello.

84
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:12,668
Hello!

85
00:14:17,602 --> 00:14:19,807
- What is your name?
- I am Greta.

86
00:14:19,807 --> 00:14:22,936
- What happened to you?
- All the girls in our village were taken.

87
00:14:22,936 --> 00:14:26,025
I was trying to reach duke
Hammond's castle when I was caught.

88
00:14:26,025 --> 00:14:29,955
Hammond? Is he alive?

89
00:14:29,955 --> 00:14:34,648
- Does he still fight in my father's name?
- You are the king's daughter?

90
00:14:34,648 --> 00:14:38,458
The night that king died, we were
told all in the castle were slain.

91
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,549
And William? Is the
duke's son still alive?

92
00:14:42,589 --> 00:14:45,677
I don't know princess.

93
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:49,488
What will they do to me?

94
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:26,308
Do you remember when we were children
begging for scraps, like those wretches?

95
00:15:26,308 --> 00:15:31,522
- Yes sister.
- Am I not kinder?

96
00:15:32,604 --> 00:15:35,211
Yes.

97
00:16:21,738 --> 00:16:27,272
These two were captured leading an
ambush on one of our supply trains.

98
00:16:34,773 --> 00:16:38,863
Your son? Handsome.

99
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:44,520
Obviously a debt owed to your mother.

100
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:49,614
There was a time I would have
lost my heart to a face like yours.

101
00:16:49,725 --> 00:16:55,304
And you, no doubt, would have broken it.

102
00:16:55,304 --> 00:16:57,616
Ian, no!

103
00:17:14,755 --> 00:17:18,821
You would kill your queen?

104
00:17:19,618 --> 00:17:23,724
Such courage, such beauty.

105
00:17:23,724 --> 00:17:28,985
How strong is your heart?

106
00:17:34,684 --> 00:17:36,677
No, my son...

107
00:17:49,711 --> 00:17:52,103
Leave him!

108
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,447
Let him return to the duke, and speak

109
00:17:56,447 --> 00:18:00,075
of generosity of his queen.

110
00:18:00,075 --> 00:18:03,781
Out!

111
00:18:42,923 --> 00:18:48,303
- Magic comes at a lofty price.
- And the expense grows.

112
00:18:48,303 --> 00:18:52,369
- You look...
- Old. - Tired.

113
00:18:55,995 --> 00:19:01,058
My power fades.

114
00:19:05,961 --> 00:19:09,308
I have something for what ills you.

115
00:20:13,449 --> 00:20:15,758
Greta?

116
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:18,974
Greta?!

117
00:20:21,699 --> 00:20:25,862
Mirror, mirror, on the wall.

118
00:20:26,078 --> 00:20:30,966
Who is fairest of them all?

119
00:20:31,086 --> 00:20:35,737
My queen, on this day,

120
00:20:35,737 --> 00:20:40,425
one has come of age,
fairer even than you.

121
00:20:40,425 --> 00:20:44,233
She is the reason your powers vain.

122
00:20:44,233 --> 00:20:49,442
- Who is it?
- Snow White?

123
00:20:49,442 --> 00:20:55,936
Snow White? She is my undoing?

124
00:20:56,456 --> 00:21:00,945
- I should have killed her when
she was a child. - Be warned,

125
00:21:00,945 --> 00:21:06,075
her innocence and purity is
all that can destroy you.

126
00:21:06,555 --> 00:21:11,484
But she is also your salvation, queen.

127
00:21:11,564 --> 00:21:17,898
Take her heart in your hand and you
shall never again need to consume youth.

128
00:21:17,898 --> 00:21:21,703
You shall never again weaken or age.

129
00:21:21,703 --> 00:21:24,509
Immortality.

130
00:21:24,509 --> 00:21:29,518
Immortality, forever.

131
00:21:31,201 --> 00:21:35,090
Finn!

132
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:39,738
Brother, bring me the king's daughter.

133
00:22:49,031 --> 00:22:52,037
Did I wake you?

134
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:06,184
You're always awake when I watch you.

135
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:14,280
- You've never come in before.
- My sister wouldn't allow it.

136
00:23:16,405 --> 00:23:21,494
- She wants you all to herself.
- I'm not afraid of her.

137
00:23:23,017 --> 00:23:28,026
And not of me?
- No.

138
00:23:28,947 --> 00:23:32,515
Fear not princess.

139
00:23:33,638 --> 00:23:37,644
You will never again be
locked up in this cell.

140
00:23:37,644 --> 00:23:41,131
What does she want from me?

141
00:23:41,172 --> 00:23:45,781
Your beating heart.

142
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:04,815
Let me out of here!

143
00:24:04,815 --> 00:24:08,903
- Now!
- Greta?

144
00:24:09,584 --> 00:24:12,830
Get me out of here!

145
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:15,596
Go!

146
00:24:45,453 --> 00:24:47,778
Stop now!

147
00:24:50,903 --> 00:24:53,189
Get her!

148
00:25:00,402 --> 00:25:03,528
Seize her!

149
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:54,707
Bring her back to me!

150
00:30:58,808 --> 00:31:05,701
How is it, that an innocent young
girl makes a fool of my brother?!

151
00:31:07,826 --> 00:31:11,833
Armed only with a nail?

152
00:31:12,515 --> 00:31:18,204
If she had a sword,
she'd taken my kingdom.

153
00:31:18,646 --> 00:31:21,731
"Bring me the king's daughter",

154
00:31:21,731 --> 00:31:28,545
and you let her slip right
through your tiny little fingers.

155
00:31:28,947 --> 00:31:34,356
How? You swore that
you would protect me!

156
00:31:34,356 --> 00:31:37,162
You swore!

157
00:31:39,445 --> 00:31:41,970
Yet there's no one I can trust.

158
00:31:41,429 --> 00:31:44,844
No one, there's no loyalty, no loyalty!

159
00:31:44,844 --> 00:31:51,788
None! Not even from you! Where is she?!

160
00:31:52,793 --> 00:31:56,086
She was chased into the Dark Forest,

161
00:31:56,086 --> 00:31:58,293
where the men lost her.

162
00:31:58,293 --> 00:32:01,826
She's no good to me in
the Dark Forest lost!

163
00:32:01,826 --> 00:32:05,924
I need her heart!
You failed me Finn!

164
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:09,537
Have I not given all to you?!

165
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:22,587
Have I not given you all?

166
00:32:23,791 --> 00:32:26,802
Yes sister.

167
00:32:34,751 --> 00:32:37,363
Quiet.

168
00:32:37,844 --> 00:32:42,382
I have no powers in the Dark Forest.

169
00:32:42,382 --> 00:32:46,557
You have to find me someone.

170
00:32:46,959 --> 00:32:50,894
Someone who knows it.

171
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:54,707
Someone who can hunt her.

172
00:32:58,722 --> 00:33:01,936
You owe me money for my pocket,
and money for the girl.

173
00:33:03,141 --> 00:33:08,240
I seem to have drunk it all, but you're
welcome to it when it comes out again.

174
00:33:13,499 --> 00:33:17,513
You've gone too far, I want my money!

175
00:33:17,513 --> 00:33:20,084
Here it is!

176
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:03,169
Queen demands your presence.
- Can't you see I'm having a bath?

177
00:34:21,317 --> 00:34:26,257
My brother tells me you
are a widower, a drunkard.

178
00:34:26,257 --> 00:34:30,472
And one of few who has
ventured into the Dark Forest.

179
00:34:30,793 --> 00:34:33,564
One of my prisoners has escaped there.
- Then he's dead.

180
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:37,218
She.
- Then she is certainly dead.

181
00:34:39,586 --> 00:34:43,121
Find her, bring her to me.

182
00:34:43,121 --> 00:34:48,861
I've been to that forest, I'm not going back.
- You will be rewarded, handsomely.

183
00:34:48,861 --> 00:34:53,157
What good is gold to me if I'm lying
dead with the crows picking at my eyes?

184
00:34:55,246 --> 00:34:59,503
Why is she of such value?
- That is none of your concern.

185
00:34:59,503 --> 00:35:06,528
I'll tell what concerns me, thank you.
- You will do this for me, huntsman!

186
00:35:06,809 --> 00:35:09,942
And if I refuse?

187
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:17,450
- Do me the favor, I beg of you.
- To his knees.

188
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:26,563
So you wish to reunited
with your beloved?

189
00:35:27,086 --> 00:35:30,499
Do not speak of my wife.

190
00:35:32,586 --> 00:35:36,522
You miss her.

191
00:35:43,269 --> 00:35:48,768
What would you give, to see her again?

192
00:35:49,771 --> 00:35:56,116
You know of my powers,
bring me the girl,

193
00:35:56,116 --> 00:35:59,890
and I will bring back your wife.

194
00:36:00,132 --> 00:36:03,626
- Nothing can bring her back.
- I can.

195
00:36:09,446 --> 00:36:14,667
A life, for a life.

196
00:36:29,723 --> 00:36:33,338
She couldn't have gone far.

197
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:37,473
Do exactly as I do.

198
00:36:38,837 --> 00:36:41,168
Bad idea.

199
00:37:06,383 --> 00:37:09,154
Stay here.

200
00:38:14,321 --> 00:38:18,336
Will you help me? Please,
the queen is going to kill me.

201
00:38:18,336 --> 00:38:22,673
- I'm sure she isn't.
- She's going to rip out my heart.

202
00:38:22,673 --> 00:38:25,163
Quick work.

203
00:38:25,565 --> 00:38:28,374
Well done Huntsman.

204
00:38:28,374 --> 00:38:31,467
Hand her over.

205
00:38:31,988 --> 00:38:34,919
What do you intend to do with her?

206
00:38:34,919 --> 00:38:40,621
- Why do you care? - You want her?
Then give me what I was promised.

207
00:38:40,621 --> 00:38:45,440
You did your job well,
now keep your word.

208
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,648
- He'll kill us both.
- Shut up.

209
00:38:47,648 --> 00:38:50,859
- He will.
- I said shut up.

210
00:38:51,261 --> 00:38:55,678
I'll keep my word when the queen
keeps hers, where's my wife?!

211
00:38:56,281 --> 00:38:59,493
He's going to betray you.

212
00:38:59,493 --> 00:39:04,432
My sister has many powers.

213
00:39:04,432 --> 00:39:08,849
She can take life away, or sustain it.

214
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:14,871
But she can't bring your wife
back from the dead you fool!

215
00:39:15,273 --> 00:39:18,164
I want her back!

216
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:23,814
I will find you!

217
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:34,453
Quiet, all right?

218
00:40:39,193 --> 00:40:42,083
What the hell is going on? Who are
you, why did the queen want you dead?

219
00:40:42,083 --> 00:40:44,973
- She wants everyone dead, all of us!
- What makes you so damn valuable?

220
00:40:45,013 --> 00:40:49,230
You should know, you're
the one hunting me.

221
00:40:52,402 --> 00:40:54,931
Forget it.

222
00:40:56,739 --> 00:41:00,874
I should have never get
involved into queen's business.

223
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:04,970
Where are you going?

224
00:41:05,291 --> 00:41:08,784
Gettn' away from you, you're
trouble, that's what you are.

225
00:41:09,185 --> 00:41:12,518
We need to get to the duke's
castle, there's an army there.

226
00:41:12,518 --> 00:41:15,329
Duke's army?

227
00:41:16,414 --> 00:41:19,827
Bunch of farmers and
milkmaids with pitchforks.

228
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:23,842
I know sheep that have
more fight in them.

229
00:41:23,842 --> 00:41:26,854
I'm valuable, that's
why you're here, isn't it?

230
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:34,884
If you return without me you're dead.
If you leave me, I'm dead.

231
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:41,428
Just for argument sake, how much reward?

232
00:41:41,428 --> 00:41:44,801
- How much is enough?
- At least 30 gold pieces...

233
00:41:44,841 --> 00:41:48,254
A hundred.

234
00:41:48,254 --> 00:41:51,747
Help me.

235
00:41:52,269 --> 00:41:55,965
- Who are you?
- Maybe you should've asked the queen that.

236
00:41:55,965 --> 00:42:01,264
- I don't trust you. - I've given
you my word. - I still don't trust you.

237
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:05,801
But you have a deal.

238
00:42:14,555 --> 00:42:18,771
Give me that, before you lose a finger.

239
00:42:23,789 --> 00:42:27,604
She killed my brave Liam with
just the palm of her hand.

240
00:42:27,604 --> 00:42:32,181
Then she drew a dagger from the
side of her, she cannot be killed.

241
00:42:33,626 --> 00:42:36,517
But there's more.

242
00:42:36,517 --> 00:42:39,650
The princess is alive.

243
00:42:41,737 --> 00:42:44,026
Where is my son?

244
00:43:39,357 --> 00:43:42,368
We have word of the princess.

245
00:43:42,368 --> 00:43:45,981
Ravenna has kept you all these years.

246
00:43:47,186 --> 00:43:49,474
She lives?

247
00:43:49,514 --> 00:43:53,531
She escaped the castle,
into the Dark Forest.

248
00:43:54,213 --> 00:43:59,553
- I'm going after her.
- We don't know if she survived, William!

249
00:44:00,034 --> 00:44:05,174
- What? - You ventured beyond the
castle walls again, disobeying my orders.

250
00:44:05,174 --> 00:44:07,865
We are all that's left,
don't you understand?

251
00:44:07,865 --> 00:44:11,678
- I cannot afford to lose any
more of my men. - I'm going alone!

252
00:44:11,678 --> 00:44:15,574
I will not lose my only son.

253
00:44:15,614 --> 00:44:19,710
- You don't know the Dark Forest.
- Then I'll find somebody who does.

254
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:23,323
I won't abandon her a second time.

255
00:44:58,457 --> 00:45:02,271
The forest gains its
strength from your weakness.

256
00:45:12,992 --> 00:45:16,526
Do you drink to drown your
sorrows, or your conscience?

257
00:45:16,526 --> 00:45:19,819
What concern is it of yours why I drink?

258
00:45:19,859 --> 00:45:23,030
I suppose a mans sorrows are his own.

259
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:26,283
What does a young girl
like you know about sorrow?

260
00:45:37,003 --> 00:45:39,533
Don't flatter yourself.

261
00:45:39,533 --> 00:45:42,424
Stay close.

262
00:46:00,171 --> 00:46:03,786
Do you need a bowman?

263
00:46:04,909 --> 00:46:07,640
I have a bowman.

264
00:46:08,522 --> 00:46:11,335
Kill him.

265
00:46:15,348 --> 00:46:19,565
I said, do you need a bowman?

266
00:46:33,218 --> 00:46:36,109
I want to show you something.

267
00:46:39,239 --> 00:46:42,130
I want you to lean front.

268
00:46:43,977 --> 00:46:46,868
If someone comes at you,
you raise this arm up,

269
00:46:46,868 --> 00:46:50,603
you block and use their
strength against them.

270
00:46:50,603 --> 00:46:53,413
You're small so wait
until they're close.

271
00:46:53,413 --> 00:46:56,224
You drive it through
their heart, to the hilt.

272
00:46:56,224 --> 00:46:59,316
You understand? Do not hesitate.

273
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:04,535
Look in their eyes and do not pull
it out until you see their soul.

274
00:47:14,172 --> 00:47:17,585
I couldn't do that.

275
00:47:17,906 --> 00:47:21,599
You might not have a choice.

276
00:47:47,579 --> 00:47:50,108
Wait.

277
00:47:51,515 --> 00:47:55,207
- Is this the edge of the Dark Forest?
- Aye.

278
00:47:56,653 --> 00:47:59,343
What is it?

279
00:48:12,593 --> 00:48:15,123
Troll!

280
00:48:25,362 --> 00:48:27,369
Go!

281
00:48:34,879 --> 00:48:36,885
Run!

282
00:50:05,622 --> 00:50:10,362
- I told you to run.
- If I had you'd be dead.

283
00:50:38,228 --> 00:50:41,880
Only the demons or spirits pass
through the Dark Forest, which are you?

284
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:47,382
- We are fugitives, from the queen
- We mean you no harm.

285
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:29,541
Where are all the men?

286
00:51:29,942 --> 00:51:33,436
Gone.

287
00:51:53,914 --> 00:51:57,127
You got nothing to drink?

288
00:51:59,255 --> 00:52:04,274
You have traveled far,
carried a great burden.

289
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:08,490
I've had worst jobs.

290
00:52:09,092 --> 00:52:13,188
Anyway, she's not that heavy.

291
00:52:15,838 --> 00:52:18,930
You don't know who she is.

292
00:52:19,331 --> 00:52:22,422
What do you mean?

293
00:52:24,952 --> 00:52:27,884
Who is she?

294
00:52:35,191 --> 00:52:37,922
Your mother wants to see you.

295
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:50,771
Why didn't you tell me?

296
00:52:51,373 --> 00:52:55,066
Cos I'd think it was
too difficult a task?

297
00:52:55,066 --> 00:52:58,079
You'd be right.

298
00:53:00,616 --> 00:53:04,230
I didn't trust you.

299
00:53:05,637 --> 00:53:08,448
I'm sorry.

300
00:53:39,573 --> 00:53:45,597
Our scars protect us. Without
beauty we are worthless to the queen.

301
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:48,890
It's a sacrifice we made,

302
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:52,747
so we could raise our children in peace.

303
00:53:52,747 --> 00:53:55,518
While their fathers are at war.

304
00:53:55,558 --> 00:54:01,259
And you, your sacrifice will come.

305
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:08,411
You must rest.

306
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:31,502
How can you desert her
when you know the truth?

307
00:54:31,502 --> 00:54:33,511
Aye, I know the truth.

308
00:54:33,511 --> 00:54:36,402
That's why she should be as
far away from me as possible.

309
00:54:36,402 --> 00:54:40,017
Anything I ever cared about
was taken away from me.

310
00:54:40,017 --> 00:54:44,555
Not this time. She's
safer here with you.

311
00:55:19,221 --> 00:55:22,944
Run rats, run!

312
00:55:26,305 --> 00:55:28,945
Find her!

313
00:55:34,505 --> 00:55:37,947
In the boat! Get in the boat!

314
00:57:21,177 --> 00:57:23,779
- Come on, let's go!
- No, we have to help them!

315
00:57:23,779 --> 00:57:27,459
You will, go! Go!

316
00:57:56,521 --> 00:58:01,143
Your beauty is all that
can save you, Ravenna.

317
00:58:01,143 --> 00:58:06,246
This spell will make your
beauty your power and protection.

318
00:58:08,576 --> 00:58:11,791
By fairest blood it is done.

319
00:58:11,791 --> 00:58:15,085
Here, drink, drink.

320
00:58:18,381 --> 00:58:24,729
But be warned, by fairest
blood this spell can be undone.

321
00:58:29,149 --> 00:58:33,167
Avenge us!

322
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:09,049
I'm sorry.

323
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:15,640
- I'm sorry, I didn't know.
- You're not. - I am. - You left us.

324
00:59:17,087 --> 00:59:20,381
We should never have been there.

325
00:59:23,194 --> 00:59:25,606
Look at me.

326
00:59:25,606 --> 00:59:29,704
I'll take you to duke Hammond's, OK?
Alright?

327
00:59:31,231 --> 00:59:34,365
You have my word.

328
00:59:48,711 --> 00:59:52,046
- This is our lucky day.
- Oh no, dwarves.

329
00:59:52,046 --> 00:59:55,420
The hedge-pig I love most in the
world, lands right in our lap.

330
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:58,876
C'mon Beith, is this
how you treat a friend?

331
00:59:58,876 --> 01:00:03,779
No, no, you puttock.
This is how I treat a friend.

332
01:00:05,305 --> 01:00:07,395
She's pretty.

333
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:11,614
And who is this? Is it
apprentice, or captive?

334
01:00:11,614 --> 01:00:13,664
- This man is helping me.
- We should kill them both.

335
01:00:13,664 --> 01:00:15,753
He's caused us nothing but trouble.

336
01:00:15,753 --> 01:00:19,249
Skewer him and leave him to rot.
I don't like killing girls.

337
01:00:19,249 --> 01:00:24,473
- I do. - Good.
- Leave her alone Duir.

338
01:00:24,473 --> 01:00:28,411
Nothing, one silver coin
and an empty codpiece.

339
01:00:28,411 --> 01:00:32,790
Two days we sit here, what for? Nothing.

340
01:00:32,830 --> 01:00:35,243
We should have stayed by the
river, what a waste of time!

341
01:00:35,243 --> 01:00:38,296
Cut us down Beith. I
have gold I can pay you.

342
01:00:38,296 --> 01:00:41,350
It is not here, it's
hidden back in the woods.

343
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:44,123
Shut your ugly mug
Huntsman. If you had any

344
01:00:44,123 --> 01:00:46,855
pennies you'd have pissed
it away on mead by now.

345
01:00:46,895 --> 01:00:49,989
- Cut us down and I'll show you.
- You lying dangler.

346
01:00:49,989 --> 01:00:52,802
Tell them the truth
Huntsman, there's no time.

347
01:00:52,802 --> 01:00:55,816
I have to take this girl to
Hammonds. She's not safe here.

348
01:00:55,816 --> 01:01:02,647
My little heart bleeds for ya. We should
chop 'em up and feed them to the wolves.

349
01:01:02,647 --> 01:01:05,983
- Who is she?
- She's worth a lot of gold to me.

350
01:01:05,983 --> 01:01:08,995
Which I'm happy to share with
you stupid little dwarves.

351
01:01:08,995 --> 01:01:12,612
- Stop that! - Gold will worth nothing
to any of you if we're all dead.

352
01:01:12,612 --> 01:01:16,631
- The queen's men hunt us, they're very close.
- Shut up.

353
01:01:17,514 --> 01:01:21,131
- You have love for the queen?
- We have no love for the queen.

354
01:01:21,131 --> 01:01:23,863
- Than you fight against her?
- No one fights against the queen.

355
01:01:23,863 --> 01:01:29,046
- We lost everything, when the king died.
- We fight only for ourselves!

356
01:01:29,087 --> 01:01:32,784
My father was king Magnus.

357
01:01:41,746 --> 01:01:44,758
Does she speak the truth?

358
01:01:44,758 --> 01:01:48,777
Yes, she is of the blood.

359
01:01:50,264 --> 01:01:53,397
She is destined, Beith.

360
01:01:54,964 --> 01:01:58,783
I see an end to the darkness.

361
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:04,528
- Riders!
- They've found us!

362
01:02:04,528 --> 01:02:06,658
If you don't cut us
down we'll all be killed!

363
01:02:06,658 --> 01:02:08,747
I don't like this
Beith, sounds like trouble.

364
01:02:08,747 --> 01:02:11,158
You'll find your weight in
gold if you cut us down now!

365
01:02:11,158 --> 01:02:14,694
- Shut up princess.
- Queen's riders!

366
01:02:14,694 --> 01:02:17,266
And they're coming this way!

367
01:02:17,306 --> 01:02:19,919
- We'll take her, but not him.
- What?

368
01:02:19,919 --> 01:02:25,423
- Take both of us. - Cut them both down Gort.
Let's get the hell out of here.

369
01:03:04,292 --> 01:03:07,387
They are close.

370
01:04:16,916 --> 01:04:19,931
Blasted fairy music.

371
01:04:19,931 --> 01:04:24,432
Here, good thing there's
plenty of moss about.

372
01:04:29,376 --> 01:04:32,109
Where are we?

373
01:04:32,391 --> 01:04:37,414
They call it Sanctuary milady.
It's the home of the fairies.

374
01:04:40,227 --> 01:04:43,443
Fairies.

375
01:04:59,105 --> 01:05:03,589
- Clear.
- No.

376
01:05:05,591 --> 01:05:07,996
Clear!

377
01:05:10,597 --> 01:05:15,003
Set up camp. Gus, Quert take the fire.

378
01:05:15,003 --> 01:05:18,007
Gort, your mug.

379
01:05:37,830 --> 01:05:43,556
Play louder I can still
'ear them harpy fairies.

380
01:05:46,639 --> 01:05:50,925
Would you really have killed her?

381
01:05:50,965 --> 01:05:54,729
Yeah, of course.

382
01:06:13,993 --> 01:06:18,958
That seat is not taken, if
that's what you were about to ask.

383
01:06:22,603 --> 01:06:26,886
- I want to thank you.
- It's only a log.

384
01:06:26,886 --> 01:06:30,891
- There's no need to thank me.
- No, for before.

385
01:06:30,891 --> 01:06:35,697
- For defending me.
- Your father was a good man,

386
01:06:35,697 --> 01:06:40,623
the kingdom prospered,
our people prospered.

387
01:06:42,185 --> 01:06:46,030
- There were more of you?
- Aye. - Yes.

388
01:06:46,030 --> 01:06:50,836
The men you see before you,
and many men more.

389
01:06:50,836 --> 01:06:57,043
Went deep into the caves,
we were noble gold miners.

390
01:06:57,043 --> 01:07:01,928
Because we could have seen
the light in the darkness.

391
01:07:02,649 --> 01:07:05,533
Gus.

392
01:07:06,213 --> 01:07:09,138
You were just a boy, but you remember.

393
01:07:09,138 --> 01:07:12,741
When we returned to the surface.

394
01:07:14,063 --> 01:07:20,951
There was nothing. The land was
blackened, everything, everyone was gone.

395
01:07:23,954 --> 01:07:26,356
Dead.

396
01:07:26,356 --> 01:07:30,561
That was the month your father died.

397
01:07:30,561 --> 01:07:35,767
- I'm very sorry.
- As am I princess, as am I.

398
01:07:36,049 --> 01:07:39,493
Son, play a happy song.

399
01:07:54,389 --> 01:07:58,514
I know I'm a bit cheeky, but...

400
01:07:58,514 --> 01:08:02,799
- Would you care for a dance?
- I'd be honored Gus.

401
01:08:23,745 --> 01:08:29,430
I don't trust her, and I don't
believe her, no matter what Muir says.

402
01:08:29,430 --> 01:08:34,557
- I've felt peculiar, queer almost.
- What? Since when?

403
01:08:34,557 --> 01:08:40,244
I'm not tingling all over, but
I feel lovely. I feel lovely.

404
01:08:40,326 --> 01:08:45,438
- How's your gout?
- Gout?

405
01:08:46,637 --> 01:08:49,632
- Better.
- And my cough.

406
01:08:51,907 --> 01:08:54,624
This is her doing.

407
01:08:54,624 --> 01:08:58,978
- How much have you had to drink?
- No, it's the mushrooms.

408
01:08:59,897 --> 01:09:03,691
Send the log downstream.

409
01:09:13,199 --> 01:09:18,989
- I thought you said you'll let bygones
be bygones. - Not yet, nut-hook.

410
01:09:29,134 --> 01:09:32,129
What's in it for you?

411
01:09:32,169 --> 01:09:36,323
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about the girl.

412
01:09:42,034 --> 01:09:45,908
Is it really just the gold?

413
01:09:45,948 --> 01:09:48,624
I'm not sure Beith.

414
01:09:48,624 --> 01:09:51,540
If I had any sense I'd
have abandoned her long ago.

415
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:54,895
Muir said she's destined.

416
01:09:54,936 --> 01:09:58,809
Question is Huntsman, for what.

417
01:11:45,123 --> 01:11:48,240
Get up.

418
01:12:05,215 --> 01:12:09,607
- Who's that, father?
- I know son, I know.

419
01:12:09,607 --> 01:12:12,484
It's him.

420
01:13:12,116 --> 01:13:16,190
No Huntsman, no one's
ever seen this before.

421
01:13:48,265 --> 01:13:52,817
White Heart bows before
the princess, father.

422
01:13:53,337 --> 01:13:57,531
- He's blessing her.
- What are you talking about?

423
01:13:58,050 --> 01:14:04,040
You have eyes Huntsman, but you do not
see. You have been with her the longest.

424
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:07,316
She is life itself.

425
01:14:07,316 --> 01:14:12,308
She will heal the land. She is the one.

426
01:14:17,023 --> 01:14:21,375
Can't you feel it? Are
your illness not gone?

427
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:26,288
Gold or no gold, where
she leads, I follow.

428
01:14:26,288 --> 01:14:29,763
- Aye. - I'm with you.
- Yes father.

429
01:14:50,054 --> 01:14:52,651
Take him!

430
01:14:53,449 --> 01:14:55,725
Go with her!

431
01:15:04,232 --> 01:15:07,029
- Stay with me!
- You wait for me!

432
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:18,212
- You first.
- No.

433
01:15:35,266 --> 01:15:37,904
Go! That way!

434
01:16:35,099 --> 01:16:38,695
No it's me! It's William!

435
01:16:52,675 --> 01:16:55,871
I admire your fight Huntsman.

436
01:16:57,347 --> 01:17:01,063
- Your wife was the same.
- What do you mean, my wife?

437
01:17:01,063 --> 01:17:03,779
I remember them all.

438
01:17:05,335 --> 01:17:10,927
Especially the ones that fight.

439
01:17:14,243 --> 01:17:16,838
She screamed your name.

440
01:17:16,838 --> 01:17:20,234
But you weren't there.

441
01:17:29,222 --> 01:17:33,495
Now, you can beg her forgiveness
in the other world.

442
01:17:50,989 --> 01:17:55,262
Sister, heal me.

443
01:18:08,164 --> 01:18:11,678
Forgive me, brother.

444
01:18:14,674 --> 01:18:17,671
I feel...

445
01:18:45,390 --> 01:18:47,388
Arrow!

446
01:19:11,391 --> 01:19:14,587
Gus breathe, just breathe.

447
01:19:31,042 --> 01:19:34,838
I won't leave you miss.

448
01:20:17,377 --> 01:20:19,772
We used to have pride.

449
01:20:19,772 --> 01:20:26,482
And now we just pilfer, drink
and dream about when we didn't.

450
01:20:26,482 --> 01:20:31,554
Every man here would die for the
chance of becoming that man again.

451
01:20:32,834 --> 01:20:37,547
So we follow you princess,
in life and in death,

452
01:20:37,547 --> 01:20:40,463
and we shall have our pride again.

453
01:20:40,463 --> 01:20:46,732
On Gus's sword, this I swear.

454
01:22:40,286 --> 01:22:43,561
I'm sorry I left you.

455
01:22:43,561 --> 01:22:46,556
You didn't.

456
01:22:46,556 --> 01:22:49,272
If I had thought you were alive...

457
01:22:49,272 --> 01:22:52,468
I would have come for you.

458
01:22:52,468 --> 01:22:55,744
We were children William.

459
01:22:55,744 --> 01:22:58,819
You are here now.

460
01:24:25,133 --> 01:24:28,128
William.

461
01:24:29,886 --> 01:24:33,322
It's as if nothings changed here.

462
01:24:35,198 --> 01:24:38,674
The world seems beautiful again.

463
01:24:38,714 --> 01:24:42,668
It will be, when you are queen.

464
01:24:43,865 --> 01:24:49,098
The people of this kingdom
hate Ravenna with every fiber.

465
01:24:49,377 --> 01:24:52,174
I used to hate her.

466
01:24:52,972 --> 01:24:56,088
But now I feel only sorrow.

467
01:24:56,088 --> 01:24:59,842
Once people find out you're alive,
they'll rise up in your name.

468
01:25:00,761 --> 01:25:04,077
It takes more than a name.

469
01:25:04,077 --> 01:25:08,470
You are your fathers
daughter, the rightful heir.

470
01:25:10,067 --> 01:25:14,540
If I had a choice,
I'd take you far away.

471
01:25:15,219 --> 01:25:18,935
Keep you safe by my side.

472
01:25:18,935 --> 01:25:22,650
But I have a duty, so do you.

473
01:25:22,650 --> 01:25:26,403
How do I inspire?

474
01:25:26,443 --> 01:25:29,798
How will I lead men?

475
01:25:29,919 --> 01:25:33,115
The way you led me
when we were children.

476
01:25:34,312 --> 01:25:38,026
I followed you everywhere.

477
01:25:38,026 --> 01:25:41,501
Ran when you called.

478
01:25:41,501 --> 01:25:45,216
I would have done anything for you.

479
01:25:45,216 --> 01:25:49,177
That's not how I remember it.

480
01:25:49,177 --> 01:25:50,902
- No?
- No.

481
01:25:51,686 --> 01:25:55,482
We used to fight, all the time.

482
01:25:55,482 --> 01:25:58,556
And argue.

483
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:29,152
- Remember that trick?
- What trick?

484
01:26:55,673 --> 01:26:58,908
You see child?

485
01:26:59,188 --> 01:27:02,781
Love always betrays us.

486
01:27:19,877 --> 01:27:21,955
Wake up.

487
01:27:54,586 --> 01:27:59,100
By fairest blood it was done.

488
01:28:00,218 --> 01:28:07,089
And only by fairest
blood can it be undone.

489
01:28:07,969 --> 01:28:12,041
You were the only one who could

490
01:28:12,041 --> 01:28:16,075
break the spell and destroy me.

491
01:28:25,262 --> 01:28:30,455
And the only one, pure enough,

492
01:28:30,455 --> 01:28:33,969
to save me.

493
01:28:35,249 --> 01:28:39,680
You don't even realise how lucky you are

494
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:44,153
never to know what it is to grow old.

495
01:29:09,597 --> 01:29:11,594
No...

496
01:29:34,042 --> 01:29:36,238
What are you looking at? Do something.

497
01:29:36,278 --> 01:29:40,432
Aren't you dwarves healers?
Save her, help her!

498
01:29:46,663 --> 01:29:49,539
No, this cannot be.

499
01:30:42,463 --> 01:30:45,577
What do we do Beith?

500
01:30:45,577 --> 01:30:48,853
What we promised.

501
01:32:53,151 --> 01:32:55,947
And here you are.

502
01:32:56,147 --> 01:33:03,136
All dressed up like you're about to wake
up and give me more grief, am I right?

503
01:33:12,163 --> 01:33:16,158
You deserved better.

504
01:33:18,835 --> 01:33:22,629
I once had a wife, princess.

505
01:33:24,106 --> 01:33:27,822
Sarah was here name.

506
01:33:27,822 --> 01:33:31,176
When I came back from
the wars I carried with me

507
01:33:31,176 --> 01:33:34,531
the stench of death
and anger of the lost.

508
01:33:34,810 --> 01:33:39,723
I wasn't worth saving, that's
for sure, but she did so anyway.

509
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:44,316
And I loved her so much.

510
01:33:44,316 --> 01:33:47,392
I loved her more than
anyone, anything, and I...

511
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:51,385
I let her out of my
sight and she was gone.

512
01:33:53,862 --> 01:34:00,492
When I became myself again,
as if I never cared for.

513
01:34:03,847 --> 01:34:07,280
Until you.

514
01:34:08,839 --> 01:34:12,435
Because you remind me of her.

515
01:34:13,633 --> 01:34:18,346
Her heart, her spirit.

516
01:34:19,743 --> 01:34:23,458
But now you too have gone.

517
01:34:23,458 --> 01:34:27,613
You both deserved better, and
I'm so sorry I failed you.

518
01:34:27,652 --> 01:34:31,126
I'm so sorry.

519
01:34:37,237 --> 01:34:43,708
But you'll be a queen in Heaven
now, and sit among the angels.

520
01:35:30,441 --> 01:35:34,555
She died for us! For our cause!

521
01:35:34,555 --> 01:35:39,427
We cannot just hide behind these
walls and watch this land die with her!

522
01:35:39,427 --> 01:35:43,542
Your grief clouds your judgment, my son.

523
01:35:43,542 --> 01:35:47,537
My grief makes me see clearer, father.

524
01:35:49,412 --> 01:35:53,808
My duty is to protect those
people who come to me for help.

525
01:35:53,808 --> 01:35:57,601
I will defend them to
the last drop of my blood.

526
01:35:57,601 --> 01:36:01,115
I will not abandon these walls.

527
01:36:21,087 --> 01:36:23,165
The spell has lifted.

528
01:36:54,039 --> 01:36:58,432
- Death has favored you.
- Death favors no man.

529
01:36:58,432 --> 01:37:03,505
We must ride, like thundering waves
under battle flag of my father.

530
01:37:03,505 --> 01:37:06,020
You must rest.

531
01:37:06,020 --> 01:37:09,017
We have rested long enough.

532
01:37:16,485 --> 01:37:20,999
Frost to fire, fire to frost.

533
01:37:24,275 --> 01:37:27,590
Iron will melt.

534
01:37:29,746 --> 01:37:34,260
But it will writhe inside of itself.

535
01:37:35,978 --> 01:37:40,850
All these years, all
I've known is darkness.

536
01:37:42,367 --> 01:37:46,961
But I have never seen a brighter
light than when my eyes just opened.

537
01:37:47,961 --> 01:37:51,714
And I know that light
burns in all of you!

538
01:37:53,233 --> 01:37:58,345
Those embers must turn to flame.

539
01:37:59,422 --> 01:38:04,216
Iron into sword.
I will become your weapon!

540
01:38:04,935 --> 01:38:09,529
Forged by the fierce fire
that I know is in your hearts!

541
01:38:10,605 --> 01:38:14,001
For I have seen what she sees.

542
01:38:14,921 --> 01:38:17,677
I know what she knows.

543
01:38:19,394 --> 01:38:22,509
I can kill her.

544
01:38:25,185 --> 01:38:28,501
And I'd rather die today,

545
01:38:28,501 --> 01:38:32,255
than live another day of this death!

546
01:38:34,173 --> 01:38:36,767
And who will ride with me?!

547
01:38:36,767 --> 01:38:41,161
Who will be my brother?!

548
01:39:26,694 --> 01:39:29,411
Farewell princess.

549
01:39:52,658 --> 01:39:56,171
- Where are they?
- Amassed on the cliffs.

550
01:39:56,171 --> 01:39:58,529
Their numbers are swollen.

551
01:39:58,569 --> 01:40:02,243
They say that the king's
standard flies again.

552
01:40:02,243 --> 01:40:08,836
Then let them come, let them break
their skulls on these stone walls.

553
01:40:08,836 --> 01:40:12,749
And bring me my prize.

554
01:40:27,608 --> 01:40:31,083
My Lord, we only have a few
hours before the tide comes on.

555
01:40:31,123 --> 01:40:33,399
Not long enough to
breach the castle walls.

556
01:40:33,399 --> 01:40:37,191
- Is there no other way in?
- There is another way.

557
01:40:51,691 --> 01:40:55,087
We're promised gold
and what do we get? Poo!

558
01:40:55,087 --> 01:40:58,681
How low has the dwarf race sunk?

559
01:40:58,681 --> 01:41:02,675
- That looks like one of mine.
- Hold this!

560
01:41:24,245 --> 01:41:27,999
Right, gatehouse is
50 yards to the right,

561
01:41:28,039 --> 01:41:32,512
- and there's a whole army out there.
- Six dwarves against an army.

562
01:41:32,712 --> 01:41:36,027
I like them odds.

563
01:41:36,704 --> 01:41:40,301
We must ride now, * will be open.

564
01:41:45,611 --> 01:41:49,367
So, you're back from the dead
and instigating the masses.

565
01:41:52,361 --> 01:41:55,876
You look very fitting in mail.

566
01:41:59,073 --> 01:42:01,389
Ride!

567
01:42:05,663 --> 01:42:09,457
We move as one.

568
01:42:12,853 --> 01:42:15,568
After you.

569
01:42:29,547 --> 01:42:32,224
Go. Go.

570
01:43:49,832 --> 01:43:52,108
Sorry.

571
01:43:54,703 --> 01:43:58,419
- What's happn'n Coll?!
- They're on the beach!

572
01:44:03,891 --> 01:44:05,888
Release!

573
01:44:45,828 --> 01:44:49,224
Ready! Release!

574
01:45:08,796 --> 01:45:12,110
Go! Go! Go!

575
01:45:14,387 --> 01:45:18,303
They're jumpin' in!

576
01:45:23,573 --> 01:45:26,648
- Back you at! Come on!
- Get back to it!

577
01:45:37,753 --> 01:45:40,268
Go! Pull!

578
01:45:40,268 --> 01:45:43,544
Nion get on that rope! Gort!

579
01:45:44,543 --> 01:45:47,018
Quert!

580
01:45:47,938 --> 01:45:51,532
- It's really messy out there!
- On that rope!

581
01:45:51,532 --> 01:45:54,529
- Now pull!
- We must turn back!

582
01:45:54,529 --> 01:46:00,638
- No! I gave them my word!
- Get on there!

583
01:48:14,523 --> 01:48:16,719
William!

584
01:50:39,833 --> 01:50:43,826
Come, and avenge your father.

585
01:50:43,826 --> 01:50:48,099
Who was too weak to raise his sword.

586
01:51:06,272 --> 01:51:08,790
Go on.

587
01:51:08,790 --> 01:51:11,864
Watch them die.

588
01:51:26,762 --> 01:51:31,956
How does it feel, knowing you were
the one who led them to their deaths?

589
01:51:31,956 --> 01:51:36,230
You see, we're not
that different, are we?

590
01:51:38,227 --> 01:51:41,022
I'm everything you're not.

591
01:52:03,190 --> 01:52:07,104
You cannot defeat me!

592
01:52:07,104 --> 01:52:10,699
I've lived twenty lives,

593
01:52:10,699 --> 01:52:13,495
ravaged entire kingdoms.

594
01:52:13,495 --> 01:52:18,688
I have been given powers which
you could not even fathom.

595
01:52:20,364 --> 01:52:23,161
I will never stop.

596
01:52:23,161 --> 01:52:25,677
Never.

597
01:52:26,874 --> 01:52:29,751
I will give this wretched world,

598
01:52:29,751 --> 01:52:34,663
the queen it deserves.

599
01:52:38,658 --> 01:52:43,052
By fairest blood it is done!

600
01:52:58,630 --> 01:53:02,623
And only by fairest blood is it undone.

601
01:53:58,022 --> 01:54:01,537
You can't have my heart.

602
01:55:11,914 --> 01:55:15,708
In the name of all that is
good an just in this land!

603
01:55:15,708 --> 01:55:19,503
I crown you queen.

604
01:56:00,363 --> 01:56:01,934
Hail to the queen!

605
01:56:02,631 --> 01:56:04,347
Hail to the queen!

606
01:56:04,690 --> 01:56:06,572
Hail to the queen!

607
01:56:06,875 --> 01:56:08,686
Hail to the queen!

608
01:56:09,031 --> 01:56:10,860
Hail to the queen!
