1
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,003
<i>Dr. Ross, we've got
satellite from the Congo.</i>

2
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,051
- What did he say, Rudy?
- I can't repeat it here.

3
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,441
- It's Charles.
- It's Charles.

4
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,762
- It won't work.
- He changed the code?

5
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,287
The old man's got me changing it
every three hours.

6
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,002
- Rudy, Rudy, Rudy, Rudy.
- Very inventive.

7
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,121
Just in time.
We should have a visual momentarily.

8
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,726
- They said they found it.
- You're kidding.

9
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,369
Seven volcanoes, and he picks the right
one. His luck's finally changed.

10
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,368
- Karen.
- I read you, Charles. And I see you.

11
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,410
<i>Well, eureka and all that.
I found the bloody thing.</i>

12
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,406
- What was that?
- The <i>usual.</i>

13
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,523
<i>This whole place does the shimmy.</i>

14
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,524
<i>- How's the volcano?
- Acting very much like</i> a <i>volcano...</i>

15
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,330
<i>thank you very much.</i>

16
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,609
<i>They tell me it's fine,
but I wouldn't build condominiums.</i>

17
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,967
Charles, did you really find it?

18
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,329
<i>Chemically flawless,
blue diamond alluvia.</i>

19
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,290
<i>Johnny-on-the-spot phasic laser.</i>

20
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,762
<i>This will look kind of raw
without a real diamond.</i>

21
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,880
<i>Would you say that test
came back positive?</i>

22
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,361
Oh, my God.

23
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,204
<i>We found the sand in a mineral stream.
Jeffrey's searching for the source.</i>

24
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,724
<i>- I'll get Travis.
- Wait. Jeffrey should share the glory.</i>

25
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,929
<i>- Let's link up again in, uh, one hour.
- Great.</i>

26
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,287
- See you <i>in</i> an <i>hour.</i>
- Give me your coordinates.

27
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,923
Char...? Charles...?

28
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,968
- Jeffrey.
- Charlie, over here.

29
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,240
Charlie, I think this
may be really something.

30
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,085
- We haven't got much time.
<i>- I'll</i> show you.

31
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,610
Jump in.

32
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,002
- What?
<i>- I'll</i> go first.

33
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,130
I Jeffrey!

34
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,411
I Jeffrey!

35
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,371
- What is this?
- Come on.

36
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,163
From below it just looks like jungle,
but it's not just jungle. See?

37
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,243
Jesus Christ.

38
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,529
This is a big deal.
This is a big find.

39
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:48,687
I can't believe it's just sitting here.
All these centuries, waiting for lucky us.

40
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,566
Listen, I raised Houston,
they're getting the old man.

41
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,606
Come on camera and share the glory.

42
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,004
- We'll have to get another team here.
- All right. Let me grab my bag.

43
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:21,164
- Perfect, you say? A flawless diamond?
- He found it. He was right.

44
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,049
With the right laser and diamonds...

45
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,885
we can dominate
the communications industry over night.

46
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,166
Has he found the source?

47
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,564
Charles says a laser with a diamond
like that can punch a hole in the moon.

48
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,643
Shh. Don't say any more out here.

49
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,248
Come on, Jeffrey. Jeffrey!

50
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,681
Come on, we're supposed to transmit
in 10 minutes.

51
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,851
Now you're throwing stuff at me?

52
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,605
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

53
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,764
- He should have transmitted 10 minutes ago.
- Ugh.

54
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,724
- Activate the remote.
- Yes, sir.

55
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,805
- I guess he's still looking for Jeffrey.
- Hmm. Pan the camera.

56
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,447
What in God's name...?

57
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,082
Lock your remote. Back scan.
Give me thermal readout.

58
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,330
- I can see seven dead people.
- What's that sound?

59
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,523
- I didn't see him. Charles!
- What?

60
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,010
<i>- I'll</i> get help.
- You can't get out. I had the code changed.

61
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,401
Well, what is it?

62
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,206
Rudy?

63
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,250
- Sir?
- Use the fire extinguisher on that.

64
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,528
- What's the code, sir?
- Do what I say!

65
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,648
- No one knows this happened but us.
- Families have to be be notified. Your wife.

66
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,811
We don't know he's dead.
If it's reported, they'll close the border.

67
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,440
- What was that thing?
- Uh, baboon.

68
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,964
- I thought it was a gorilla, but I've never...
- Gorillas didn't kill. Gorillas don't do that.

69
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,245
- It could have been locals, a rival company.
- Not another paranoid fantasy.

70
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,727
I need those diamonds, Dr. Ross!

71
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,167
- Are you for real?
- It's the future.

72
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,367
- Most believe children are the future.
- 40,000 people, they all depend on me.

73
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,360
This satellite is our cash cow.

74
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:27,811
In three years it'll be obsolete. I need
a new cash machine. This diamond's it!

75
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,211
- Charles knew it. That's why he went.
- He went into the Congo to please you.

76
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,967
- I know you had feelings for him.
- I almost married him.

77
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,168
Listen to me, talking like he's...

78
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,049
You have to go down there, Dr. Ross.

79
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,522
You're good in the field. You were
good in Panama. Once you're local...

80
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,650
that laser's power pack
should give off a readable signal.

81
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,963
Find some expedition that's already going.
Take it over.

82
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,565
What are you talking about?

83
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,611
There's no time! Once we let out what's
happened, Zaire will shut the border.

84
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,047
- By the time the investigation's...
- Are you human?

85
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,325
I'll be human later. Hire people
when you get there. Good people.

86
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,130
Never mind, I'll have some waiting.

87
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,410
- Find out what happened to Charles.
- Tell me you love your son.

88
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,688
- I do.
- And that's why you're sending me.

89
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,769
It is.

90
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:18,729
All right. But if I have one moment when
I think otherwise, I'll make you sorry.

91
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,450
That's a promise.

92
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,207
<i>Oakland's number one classic station...</i>

93
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,607
<i>taking you back in time, all the time.</i>

94
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,683
<i>There's
a crazy little shack</i>

95
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:41,688
Wow. Isn't that beautiful?
What's Amy's favorite color?

96
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:47,802
Green, that's right.
How green was my valley... Drop that!

97
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,050
Good. Pretty. So pretty.

98
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:57,491
No, Amy, on the paper. Yeah, okay, good.

99
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,085
Amy, get some more paint.

100
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,485
Good. That's green.

101
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,446
No, Amy, on the paper.
On... On the paper.

102
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,690
Good. That's good.
Good girl. Such a pretty girl.

103
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,286
That's your lovey. That's your lovey.

104
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,482
Amy! Hey, you!

105
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,649
- How did she sleep?
- Great night.

106
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,609
- No nightmares?
- Not a one.

107
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,410
Good girl.

108
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,403
That's my Amy.

109
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,684
Richard, you better clean her up.
It's showtime.

110
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,321
When we started out, it was so simple.

111
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,883
Communication is what separated
human from animal. Speech.

112
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,127
And for those humans who had
am impairment that inhibited speech...

113
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,965
sign language. An alphabet in gestures.

114
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,522
Words in motion. Then came virtual reality.

115
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:01,403
Sensors worn like clothing could read
and replicate the body's movements.

116
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:08,285
Arliss Wender at MIT was the first to
apply this technology to sign language.

117
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,321
<i>Our subject, William,
was born without the organs of speech.</i>

118
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,403
<i>Isn't that right, William?</i>

119
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,611
<i>That is absolutely right.</i>

120
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,643
<i>This is the first time
I have ever heard my own voice.</i>

121
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,123
Lights, please.
It's hard to get grants for what I do.

122
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:46,801
Most people just don't believe it.
They think it's a parlor trick. A gag.

123
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,122
But it's no gag, ladies and gentlemen.

124
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,760
With this new technology,
I can demonstrate it...

125
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,005
in a way it has never been possible
to demonstrate it before.

126
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,244
Animals can talk.

127
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,563
Amy, could you come down
here please?

128
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,242
Hello, Amy. Thank you for the flowers.

129
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,807
<i>Peter. Hello, Peter.</i>

130
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,246
Wow.

131
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,446
Amy, how old are you?

132
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:35,004
<i>Amy 7. Amy good gorilla.</i>

133
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,247
<i>- Amy pretty.
- Yes, you are.</i>

134
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,485
This is a talking gorilla, Moira.
This gorilla is talking!

135
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,564
- I know, Boyd.
- But this is really happening.

136
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:51,049
- This isn't Mr. Ed.
- I know it's not Mr. Ed.

137
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,327
Amy, look at me.

138
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:59,890
- Amy mother.
- That's right. That's your baby.

139
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,364
<i>- Amy wants lunch.</i>
- Okay.

140
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,927
- What do you think, Mrs. Romy?
- It's spooky. Very spooky.

141
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:15,120
Amy's above average intelligence
for a gorilla, but she's not a freak.

142
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,446
What she has learned,
other gorillas have learned and can learn.

143
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,410
But that takes money, of course.
Isn't that right, Amy?

144
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,808
Amy, calm down. Easy.

145
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,282
Hey, hey, hey! Shh, shh.
It's okay. You're all right.

146
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:55,168
- You've got her sedated. She'll be fine.
- She's not gonna be fine. Nightmares again.

147
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:00,406
It's happened before. Gorillas in captivity
degenerating mentally, having to be destroyed.

148
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,962
When she did these paintings
she got better. Why?

149
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:12,763
Hey, hey...
What's this room starting to look like?

150
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,969
- The Jungle, she's been painting the jungle!
- I don't know, Peter.

151
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,246
She wants to go home.

152
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:25,248
Peter, you did a great job. You taught a
gorilla to talk, to paint, for gosh sakes.

153
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,331
When it comes to Amy, you can get a grant
for anything except setting her free.

154
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,131
How about this. I taught her,
now she can teach them.

155
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,890
- Who?
- The mountain gorillas.

156
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,169
We can translate
what other animals are saying.

157
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,449
Oh, please. Making you Dr. Doolittle?

158
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,401
There isn't a foundation in motion that would
fund an expedition with that objective.

159
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,608
I will pay.

160
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,369
- I will pay for Amy to go home.
- And who are you?

161
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:58,211
Herkermer Homolka. Formerly of Romania.
Free now of the chains of Ceaucescu.

162
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,569
Traveling the world, doing good.

163
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,121
- A Romanian philanthropist?
- Herkermer Homolka.

164
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,090
- Something's voodoo.
- Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.

165
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,727
I don't think it's penetrating.
We're taking Amy home. Get packed.

166
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,649
Do you know where we're going?
Amy, where are we going?

167
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,441
- Jungle. <i>Me</i> jungle.
- She's really excited.

168
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,366
- Are you excited?
- Me? I'm terrified.

169
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,320
- Jungle.
- Safari? I don't even like picnics. Nice glasses.

170
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,608
<i>ANN".
Jungle. Me jungle.</i>

171
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,203
<i>- That's right. Jungle. Home.
- Tickle me. Tickle me.</i>

172
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,324
Come on, time to go.

173
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,444
Someone looking for me?

174
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,364
Herkermer Homolka, hello.
Uh, the transport.

175
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,931
Oh, yeah. Um...

176
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,806
- ls there a problem?
- Not unless there's a problem.

177
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,809
Are you excited, sweetheart? That's a
camera. Be careful, it's expensive.

178
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,964
I think she's got a real eye.

179
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,842
- Karen Ross. Professor Karen Ross.
- Professor Peter Elliot.

180
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,365
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

181
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,166
Have you got my faxes,
Fed Exes and phone calls?

182
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,448
- I'm sorry, you're the one.
- Yes, I'm the one.

183
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,648
We've put together a hasty expedition.

184
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,962
To the Congo, with a talking gorilla.

185
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:38,011
- Jungle me. Jungle. <i>Tickle</i> Amy.
- That's right, jungle. Just a minute, Amy.

186
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,886
- I'm sorry... I'm afraid that's impossible.
- I need to join up with you.

187
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,525
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

188
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,843
- I have all the visas.
- Go ahead and load this stuff on the plane.

189
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,520
- We're taking this stuff off the plane.
- Off the plane?

190
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,207
- I can pay part of the cost.
- Why take stuff off the plane?

191
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,490
- I'm sorry, we don't need any money.
- You're flying way under capacity.

192
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,210
You can easily find room for me.

193
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,081
- It's not a matter of that. It's Amy.
<i>- Ugly</i> woman.

194
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,447
- The gorilla?
- She gets jealous very easily.

195
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,961
Somebody tell me
why you're unloading the plane.

196
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,646
- Talk to the operations guy.
- Can't you tell me?

197
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,802
- No.
- I've gotta get on this plane.

198
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,010
I've got to be listed with your manifest,
or my visas are worthless. Name your price.

199
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,323
I don't have a price. I'm not a pound
of sugar, I'm a primatologist.

200
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,960
Don't be hasty, Dr. Elliot.

201
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,565
Herkermer Homolka,
formerly of Romania.

202
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,530
- Dr. Karen Ross.
- There seems to be some glitch.

203
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,445
- They're unloading the plane.
- Yes.

204
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,209
Unfortunately there has been
a slight interruption in my credit flow.

205
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,001
- I am unable to pay for the fuel.
- I'll pay for the fuel.

206
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,563
<i>- I'll</i> pay for it. How much is the fuel?
- Fifty-six thousand dollars.

207
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,085
Fifty-six thousand?

208
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,250
What are you smiling about?

209
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,647
You need me, Dr. Elliot.

210
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,765
<i>Taxi to</i>
runway, three-one <i>left.</i>

211
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,364
<i>This is your captain speaking.</i>

212
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,568
<i>- Hey.
- We've been cleared for take-off.</i>

213
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,611
<i>Please make sure that your seat belts
are fastened and that all carry-on...</i>

214
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,367
We're returning her to the jungle
from whence she came.

215
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,522
From the look of it, not a moment too soon.

216
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,207
- You're the reason she's upset.
- Me? What did I do?

217
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,444
<i>- Ugly</i> woman.
- Yes, very ugly.

218
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,642
Now let's get your seat belt on.

219
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,566
Forgive me. I'll explain later.
See? I'm buckling my seat belt.

220
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:34,487
- We're all buckling our seat belts.
- You can do it.

221
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,885
That's it. Good girl. Here's an egg.

222
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,241
Unh.

223
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,563
We do not throw things.
- ls that animal dangerous?

224
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,726
Humans are dangerous,
gorillas are very gentle.

225
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,811
So you think the gorilla
may be dangerous? Maybe so.

226
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,971
- Don't perpetuate a myth.
- What myth?

227
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,327
The King Kong myth,
the myth of the killer ape.

228
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:05,846
- Are you certain there aren't gorillas that kill?
- Please, doctor. You can't be serious.

229
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,571
What's your area of expertise,
folk singing?

230
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,811
- Communications technology.
- You're a geek with a cell phone.

231
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,167
I'm a scientist. But you
and your protégé...

232
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,727
as far as I can see,
belong in the circus.

233
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,482
Listen, just because you came up with
a wad of cash at the crucial moment...

234
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,846
It's okay, Amy.

235
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,441
<i>Where ground?</i>

236
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,762
- Where ground?
- It's fine. We're flying.

237
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,091
- We're going to the jungle.
- Amy want <i>green</i> drop <i>drink.</i>

238
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,723
<i>- No.
- Amy want green drop drink.</i>

239
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,370
All right, all right.

240
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,366
You'd swear they were married.

241
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:58,488
The notion of the "killer ape" may be politically
incorrect, but that's not to say it's untrue.

242
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,364
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

243
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,203
Cliches usually contain some
element of truth.

244
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:15,960
- Are you serving that ape a martini?
- She's allowed one. It'll calm her down.

245
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,606
In my life I have heard
many a bizarre story.

246
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:27,364
Many a bizarre story
containing bizarre truth.

247
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,766
Dr. Ross, I'm sorry I called
you ugly, but if I didn't...

248
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,048
I know, it was for Amy's benefit.

249
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,842
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

250
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,286
Why teach an ape to talk?

251
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,441
Why teach at all? Why teach anything
to anyone? It doesn't make you rich.

252
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,250
Doesn't get you girls.

253
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,762
Why did Prometheus steal fire
only to turn around and give it away?

254
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,085
There's an inherent generosity
in the human spirit.

255
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,328
One of its faces is the
face of the teacher.

256
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:37,206
I repeat, why teach an ape to talk?

257
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,125
- No practical reason.
- Then why did you do it?

258
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,004
"A lonely impulse of delight."

259
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,043
- William Butler Yeats.
- Very good.

260
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,964
- Did it work?
- What do you mean?

261
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,487
You're not lonely anymore?

262
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,526
Why are you going to Africa?

263
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,846
To find something I lost.

264
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:32,480
- There you go. Watch your step.
- Dr. Ross!

265
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,369
- Dr. Ross!
- Hello?

266
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:43,203
Eddie Ventro. Mr Travis asked me
to meet your plane, set up your expedition.

267
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,564
- Her expedition? She's just along for the ride.
- Whatever. Be an asshole.

268
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:52,362
- Who is this guy?
- Eddie Ventro, transportation and equipment.

269
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:56,969
But I don't supply assholes with new
personalities. Wanna see your new plane?

270
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,447
Let's go! Hold on.

271
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,762
- Wanna sell that gorilla?
- No.

272
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,485
- Worth a lot of money.
- How much?

273
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,120
- Mr. Homolka, I can't believe you.
- I'm just curious.

274
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,487
Twenty, twenty-five grand for a female.

275
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:17,201
- Amy want to go home. Go home.
- I'm taking you home,</i> Amy.

276
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:23,129
Whoa, a talking gorilla! I feel the money hairs
on the back of my neck going woo, woo, woo.

277
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,929
Mr. Travis told me to load you up. The
works. You know how to use all this stuff?

278
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,321
- I'll get by.
- You really need a balloon?

279
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,130
No, I don't. Let me see that.

280
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,207
- Who are they?
- Hi, fellas!

281
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,606
Fuck if I know. Don't ask.
We're on our third government in two years.

282
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,570
- So are you our guide?
- No, I stay at the airport.

283
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,210
Supposing you got Monroe Kelly.

284
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,682
- Is he good?
- He's very good. He's also very late.

285
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,406
Whoa.

286
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,847
- Holy shit, now what?
- What was that?

287
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,049
Haven't got a clue. I feel like
this airport's just gone to shit.

288
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,809
- All right, give me your passports.
- We already arranged for a guide.

289
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,849
- Robertson Reynolds.
- Yeah, I fired him.

290
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,809
- You what?
- Reynolds is a bird-watcher.

291
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,327
- I hired Robertson Reynolds.
- You would.

292
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,962
You have any idea what's going on
in the Congo as of this morning?

293
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,687
The Kigani have had it with Zaire
and they're eating people.

294
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,287
You go in with Reynolds, you're coming out
somebody's bowel movement.

295
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,603
There you go. Now wasn't that
easier than going through customs?

296
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,842
Monroe.

297
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,768
- Guess what?
- What?

298
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,207
- We need to switch airports.
- Oh, shit, why?

299
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,850
Bomb in the president's car.

300
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,321
It was the president's car?
Did they get him?

301
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,211
That's the bad news. No, they didn't.

302
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,966
- I hope you folks have lots of money.
- We do.

303
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,601
Thank you. Now run away.
Oh, come on, man, run away.

304
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,488
- Get in the back.
- What about equipment?

305
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,722
Leave it to Eddie. I would hurry, really.

306
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,564
- Is this normal?
- Get in the truck.

307
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,087
- You're on your own, Eddie.
- Yeah, how I like it.

308
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,291
- Where do you want me to set you up?
- Get a DC-3.

309
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,047
A grass strip south of Kegoma. Get it
stripped. Keep this from the company.

310
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,922
First the Kigani in Zaire, now this godfather
stuff. Not a good day to be in Africa.

311
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,447
- Lower the flaps.
- So long, good luck!

312
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,449
Now sit down.

313
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,131
I'm getting out of here. Unh!

314
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,802
- What's going on?
- Are we safe?

315
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,011
It's all right, just bumpy.
Just a few bumps.

316
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,168
Amy, leave that man alone.

317
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,128
Amy, don't inhale.

318
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,282
- Karen Ross?
- That's me.

319
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,250
Monroe Kelly.
I'm your great white hunter for this trip.

320
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:37,247
- Though I happen to be black.
- How bad is this news for us?

321
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:42,122
Whenever the leadership of one of these little
Central African countries comes into question...

322
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,964
they tend to murder everybody.

323
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,122
- Oh, my God!
- Not really?

324
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,601
They live for the opportunity
to settle scores.

325
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:53,243
And they've got a lot of scores to settle.
It's like what's going on in the Congo.

326
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,728
- Things are pretty bad in the Congo.
- We heard.

327
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,611
The Kigani are pissed off.

328
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:05,005
Can't blame them. The 20th century sucks.
Maybe the 21st will be better.

329
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,965
- You some kind of criminal, aren't you?
- Aren't we all?

330
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,731
No. I'm not a criminal, I'm a scientist.

331
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,609
Scientist?

332
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,970
I run a few guns,
you sons of bitches ruin the world.

333
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,411
I don't think it's a good idea to have
further involvement with these people.

334
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,801
What would you suggest we do, Dr. Elliot?

335
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,483
As soon as we can,
we should go our own way.

336
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,926
- Ugh.
- Don't I know you?

337
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,764
Perhaps. I travel a great deal.

338
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,324
- What are you doing with that gorilla?
- Taking her home.

339
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,960
She was caught
in the Virunga region of the Congo.

340
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,886
You're going to try and take her back
to the farm now that she's seen Paris?

341
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,169
- And this is your cover?
- Yes.

342
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,961
Pretty good. Or, it would have been.

343
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:58,364
- I'm nobody's cover. Cover for what?
- You find yourself in the middle of something.

344
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,410
- Cover for what?
- I don't know, and she won't tell you.

345
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,166
But the kind of money
her company is throwing around?

346
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,130
They don't spend that for any gorilla.

347
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,964
Relax. You're in better hands
than you should be.

348
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,886
No one can go to Zaire.
The border is shut. There is a revolt.

349
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,883
That's not my fault. Where's my gorilla?

350
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,611
- The gorilla will be kept...
- That is very precious...

351
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,685
- isn't this a hospital?
- This one's decided to speak.

352
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,162
- This is pure Kafka.
- Who is Kafka? Tell me!

353
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,406
- Monroe.
- Captain Wanta.

354
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:30,726
How are you?
Miss Ross, such a pleasure.

355
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,603
Have some, uh, coffee and cake.

356
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,641
Have some!

357
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,125
You have our visas. Our manifest.
This is a legitimate scientific mission.

358
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,243
You have no right to detain us.

359
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,722
Liar, liar, pants on fire.

360
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,968
So says my computer, Miss Ross.

361
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,243
Ah. You used to work for the CIA.
And now you're TraviCom.

362
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,246
- TraviCom pays better than the CIA?
- You have a big mouth.

363
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,325
Everybody says that about me.
What can I do?

364
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,006
Monroe, you have
the worst timing in the world.

365
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,286
Tell me about it.

366
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,966
They blew up the president's Mercedes,
did you know?

367
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:24,489
It's a big plot. Our country will
be in shit for at least a year.

368
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,921
- Captain, I need that truck.
- You need the truck.

369
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,084
You also need ten good men to the border.

370
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,321
More.

371
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,365
Mr. Homolka?

372
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,324
Mm.

373
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,045
Stop eating my sesame cake.

374
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,967
Stop eating my sesame cake!

375
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,125
Mm.

376
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:16,401
What are you doing in my country,
you bag of shit?

377
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:21,122
Captain, please.
I only wish to explore and discover.

378
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:27,401
This fellow is a big bag of shit.

379
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:33,442
Shake this rat from off your neck. He owes
money to everybody everywhere he goes.

380
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,001
I will ask you to wait outside, Mr.
Homolka.

381
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,283
I like that, Miss Ross. You surprise him.

382
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,405
Ah.

383
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,480
<i>Hey-</i>

384
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,167
So I put this away.

385
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,811
Don't want nobody peeking.

386
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,890
You know, it's the gorilla that's going
to get you across the border safely.

387
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,685
Everybody's so afraid of being seen in an
American movie being cruel to a gorilla.

388
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:23,888
This is the crazy world we live in.
Okay, you can go.

389
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:29,806
Hit the road, as they say.
And have a nice day.

390
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,964
- You all right?
- Yeah.

391
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,248
Admit it, you're glad to see me.

392
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,646
- Kahega!
- Ah, Monroe!

393
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,568
Kikuyu tribesman, very nice guy.

394
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,371
- Are we in Zaire?
- Tanzania.

395
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:13,402
Stay close to me. Amy. Amy, come on.

396
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,326
- Somehow, I think this is at my expense.
- You're right.

397
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,130
When do you think we will
get to the rainforest?

398
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,363
- Herkermer Homolka, right?
- Yes. Hi, hello.

399
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,285
You're not looking for
Solomon's city again, are you?

400
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,408
What are you talking about?

401
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,131
Mr. Homolka was part of
a disastrous expedition...

402
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,886
- about, what, five years ago?
- I would prefer you...

403
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,766
They were looking for a city called Zinj.
Unfortunately, it doesn't exist.

404
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,008
- It does exist!
- Fine.

405
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,004
Three members of his safari
died from exposure.

406
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,484
- A fourth was shot by we don't know who.
- It was an appalling suicide.

407
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,446
We won't quibble. And Mr. Homolka
had to be carried out of the jungle...

408
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,210
by, as I remember it, me.

409
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,681
I knew he wasn't a Romanian philanthropist.

410
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:15,562
Oh, he's Romanian. And he has
done good, but mostly for Mr. Homolka.

411
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:19,008
- Shut up, you filthy...
- Filthy what?

412
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:27,331
Forgive me. All that
traveling has left me...

413
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,801
."shaken.

414
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,329
Think nothing of it. All aboard!

415
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,489
- What's all this stuff?
- Courtesy of Eddie Ventro.

416
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,005
Eddie! What happened?

417
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,087
Ugh. A customs guy hit me with a can
of peanut oil for stamping visas.

418
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,208
I'm never going back to that country, man.

419
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,522
- Those people have permanently wigged out.
- Ha, ha.

420
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,170
- Dr. Ross.
- Hi.

421
00:36:55,320 --> 00:37:00,451
Equipment list. You got everything but the
balloon and the home entertainment center.

422
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,570
- Ah. Your boss says "Call me."
- Okay.

423
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,645
You got 11 good guys, significant
firepower, significant technology.

424
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,326
More than that
I don't think you're gonna need. Agree?

425
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,766
- I agree.
- Good luck.

426
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,048
- Bye, Eddie.
- Bye, Monroe.

427
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,166
- May I?
- There's one thing I don't understand, Monroe.

428
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,566
What's that, Dr. Elliot?

429
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,449
If the border to Zaire is shut...

430
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,444
- how do we get across?
- Luck.

431
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,086
What's going on?

432
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,569
What the hell is that?

433
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:21,006
Shit. I thought we'd get farther.
I'd put her out now.

434
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,845
- Oh, you would? Who's firing on us?
- Kahega!

435
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,810
We crossed the border into Zaire.
We're violating airspace.

436
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,485
- She likes bananas?
- Sure.

437
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,803
Here, eat this, darling.
She's going to feel great.

438
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,010
- What do you mean?
- Something to keep her calm. Gorilla Prozac.

439
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,723
- Can we make it to Bondo?
- I don't know!

440
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,366
That last one was a heat-seeker.
We're done.

441
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,370
- What are you doing?
- Step aside, please.

442
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,929
<i>Hey-</i>

443
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,442
Miss Ross. Here.

444
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,930
- Why are they putting on parachutes?
- Figure it out.

445
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,242
- Take it.
- Oh, no!

446
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,767
- This isn't gonna work.
- Yes it is. I'll take Amy.

447
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:16,049
- She might get hurt. I can't risk it.
- You know how to fly this plane?

448
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,282
- No.
- The pilot and co-pilot are gone.

449
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,329
So, what are you going to do?

450
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,803
Ugh.

451
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,004
Go! Go, go, go!

452
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,885
Push me, please.

453
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,003
Harder, please.

454
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,761
You want me to push you too?

455
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,286
See you down there.

456
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,442
Oh!

457
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,846
- Where's Amy?
- Now she's asleep.

458
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,129
Over there. On the way down,
she decided to wake up.

459
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:32,002
- And that little lady has some set of teeth.
- I'm sorry, but we have to call this off.

460
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,003
- I beg your pardon?
- I'm in over my head.

461
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,845
- I'm not James Bond.
- Don't worry, I'll take care of you.

462
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,287
I don't want you to take care of me.

463
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,085
Fine. I'm taking a safari
into the Virunga region of the Congo.

464
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,483
If you don't want to go, just go wherever.

465
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:52,282
But you should know this is a dangerous
place, and people die here very easily.

466
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,288
Now, excuse me.

467
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,840
Amy?

468
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,001
Amy? Amy!

469
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,923
Amy?

470
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:25,847
Such an extraordinary animal.

471
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:30,762
Those paintings. Do you think she was
drawing something she saw in life?

472
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,291
Or in a dream, maybe?

473
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:36,650
- I think she was drawing a jungle, home.
- What about those oval shapes?

474
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:40,811
- Just a shape she likes, something like that.
- Perhaps.

475
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,650
- Video game?
- It gives latitude and longitude.

476
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:49,840
- More than that, from the look of it.
- Well, you know, it's a gadget. It has features.

477
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,731
You're picking up a signal.
Someone or something?

478
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,803
- A little bit Of both.
- Ah.

479
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,124
- So why did you quit the CIA?
- I never worked for the CIA.

480
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,481
Of course you didn't.

481
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,530
But if you had worked for the CIA,
why would you quit?

482
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,081
Because they're a loveless bunch
of sons of bitches.

483
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,050
- And you're not?
- And I'm not.

484
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,043
Glad to hear it.

485
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:22,568
- Okay, here we go.
- Ah. Fabulous equipment.

486
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,161
- Best of the best.
- I have air-conditioning, too.

487
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,288
Air-conditioners?

488
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,240
- I suppose it is a bit much.
- Shit, I'll take one.

489
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,680
Hey, Stop it!

490
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,848
Mr. Homolka...

491
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,689
- Please, call me Herkermer.
- All right. You can call me Mr. Kelly.

492
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:56,044
- I wonder what she's about.
- What do you mean?

493
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,487
She's after something.
You're after something.

494
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:02,486
What you're after, I've got figured.
But what she's after, I don't know.

495
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,688
I'll get you! I'll get you!

496
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:10,604
I'm helping that young scientist
return his ward to the wild.

497
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:15,004
He says the ape may be able to tell us
the thoughts of the wild gorillas.

498
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,889
Well I can tell you your thoughts.

499
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,647
You're looking for King Solomon's
diamonds. The lost city of Zinj.

500
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,807
- I've given it up.
- You'll never give it up.

501
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,804
The problem is, Herkermer,
it doesn't exist.

502
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:33,921
Solomon must have gotten his diamonds
from Cartiers, like everybody else.

503
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:42,764
Ha-ha-ha. You like that, don't you?
Ha-ha-ha.

504
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,610
Time for Madam Amy's vitamins.

505
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:57,169
This is Karen Ross. 81452.

506
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:02,645
That is KR81452.
Houston, Travis, do you read?

507
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:08,088
<i>Karen Ross, 81452.
Houston, Travis, do you read?</i>

508
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:13,161
I read and see you, Dr. Ross.
Congratulations on crossing the border.

509
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,091
<i>I'm picking up a signal
from the laser's power pack.</i>

510
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:20,005
Excellent. Wherever the laser is,
Charles should be too.

511
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:24,563
Let's hope so. Tomorrow we enter the
rainforest at the base of the volcanic range.

512
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:29,846
<i>Good. Karen, I've had those images
of that creature analyzed. Rudy.</i>

513
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:39,363
<i>What's W?
- My primatologist tells me it's something new.</i>

514
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,767
<i>He doesn't know what,
but it's gorilla-like.</i>

515
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,809
Are you sufficiently armed?

516
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,770
- Do you have enough manpower?
<i>- Yes.</i>

517
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:50,641
Good. The bad news is Geo-thermal.
You've got to hurry.

518
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,691
That region in the Virungas is bad.
Sometimes the volcanic activity...

519
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,810
<i>is breaking out of the graph.
The region's going to blow.</i>

520
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,571
<i>Could be a week, could be sooner.
Dr. Ross...</i>

521
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,961
- What the hell...?
- Watch out!

522
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:06,567
No, dammit! Not again!

523
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,241
Oh. I'm terribly sorry.

524
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,404
It's destroyed.

525
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,971
It's completely destroyed.

526
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,163
- What is that?
- What is that?

527
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:56,120
Full moon. Colobus monkeys.

528
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:00,330
- That's monkeys?
- Mating season.

529
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:05,287
When there's a moon like that, every monkey
for 200 miles thinks he's Elvis Presley.

530
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,484
Aah!

531
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:18,761
Aah!

532
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,685
Aah!

533
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:03,566
It's Amy's medical supplies.
They can't get wet.

534
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:29,601
- Oh, shit! Somebody help me.
- What is it?

535
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,764
There's something on my...
Like, a creature, growth or something.

536
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,964
- Look.
- Ah. That's a leech.

537
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:39,283
- Take it off.
- It's your leech, you take it off.

538
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,885
- Need some help?
- No.

539
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,281
- Here, burn it off with this.
- Ha-ha-ha.

540
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,885
- Ha, ha.
- Ugh.

541
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,168
- Mm!
- This is disgusting.

542
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,650
Thank you for your compassion.

543
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,764
Mm-hm.

544
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,651
Here.

545
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,761
- Monroe?
- Don't indicate you see them.

546
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:19,165
Mizumu. The ghost tribe.
There are probably 20 of them.

547
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,083
- I only see two.
- Yes, that's how they are.

548
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,801
- Are they friendly?
- They're sensitive. They're forest people.

549
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:42,051
- Why are they laughing?
- They asked who was in charge, I said I was.

550
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,368
- What's so funny about that?
- I'm black.

551
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,568
I should have luggage on my head.

552
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,128
He says there's a dead white man...

553
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,045
in this forest with a
symbol on his clothes.

554
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,250
He's dead? Did they say he's dead?

555
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:13,247
- What does "TC" mean?
- TraviCom. The company I work for.

556
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,602
They have several levels of "dead."

557
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,367
Someone's not dead
until they're completely dead.

558
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,962
They haven't moved him.
They believe his soul has left his body.

559
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:05,607
If they move him, his soul will be lost,
never finding his body again.

560
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,570
They're calling to his soul,
asking it to come back.

561
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:37,246
Where is the man?

562
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,806
- It's not him.
- Not who?

563
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,406
It's Bob Driscoll. What happened to him?

564
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,927
Bob? Bob?

565
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,082
- Let's sit him up.
- Who is this man?

566
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:04,370
My company sent an expedition to
the Virungas. This man was with them.

567
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:06,846
Lay him over there.

568
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,731
- What happened to him?
- I don't know.

569
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,805
Bob?

570
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,402
- He's dead.
- God, no.

571
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,842
That region of the Congo is uninhabited.

572
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,162
- Something inhabits it.
- What did you see?

573
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:05,045
Camp destroyed. People dead.
A gray gorilla or something.

574
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,282
- No such thing as a gray gorilla.
- I saw one.

575
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,920
- That's hard to believe.
- Two men are unaccounted for.

576
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,606
Jeffrey Weems
and Charles Travis, my fiancé.

577
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,285
- My former fiancé.
- Former?

578
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:16,363
We'd better get to him, then.

579
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:23,086
Beautiful boats.
Money's a wonderful thing.

580
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,163
Give her the banana with the dope inside?

581
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:28,802
Yes, he gave her the banana
with the dope inside.

582
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:32,169
I know. Shitty Peter. I know.

583
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,641
Hey, what's this?

584
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,970
Oh.

585
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:40,927
All <i>the</i> leaves are brown

586
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,845
<i>And the sky is gray</i>

587
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,480
<i>I've been for a walk</i>

588
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,563
<i>On</i> a <i>winters day</i>

589
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,484
<i>On a winters day</i>

590
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:54,201
<i>I'd be safe and warm</i>

591
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:58,251
<i>If I was in L.A.</i>

592
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:02,121
<i>- California dreaming
- California dreaming</i>

593
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:06,046
<i>On such a winters day</i>

594
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:10,524
<i>Stopped into a church</i>

595
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,401
Watch out for the rock!

596
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:25,806
Whoa!

597
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,885
Hang on!

598
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:52,805
- What is this Zinj, Mr. Homolka?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

599
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,328
It's been believed that King Solomon
had a diamond mine in the Congo...

600
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,970
in a city called Zinj.

601
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:00,089
Diamonds?

602
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:07,131
I suppose there's no point
in playing stupid.

603
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:12,241
We shall arrive there together,
we shall all be rich.

604
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,165
That's fine with me.
Except there's no Zinj.

605
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:18,529
Half the safaris that have gone in looking
never made it back.

606
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:20,489
The other half came back with nothing.

607
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:25,328
Yes, but we have a trumping card
that they did not have.

608
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:29,246
- We do?
- We do. That gorilla...

609
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,888
- knows where it is.
- What?

610
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,724
The gorilla?

611
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:38,169
As a young man,
I found a book in Soviet Georgia.

612
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:42,803
It contained a detailed drawing
of the city of Zinj.

613
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:46,847
The drawing contained
a peculiar decoration.

614
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,807
An open eye.

615
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:54,568
Later, on safari, I found this.

616
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:00,486
It's the same symbol. Now...

617
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,844
look at this.

618
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:08,601
The gorilla drew this.

619
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,881
It is the same image. It is the open eye.

620
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:21,600
That gorilla has seen the city of Zinj.

621
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:29,448
- And she will take us there!
- Have you been taking your medication?

622
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:36,723
Have your laughing, and I will have mine.

623
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,440
Shit...

624
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:50,283
- What is it?
- The signal stopped.

625
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:54,968
- Does that mean...?
- It just means the signal stopped.

626
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,810
I don't know what it means.

627
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:59,724
No problem.

628
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:27,766
Oh, my God!

629
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,362
- Shoot it!
- Amy!

630
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:44,002
- What is it?
- Turn the boat around, quickly.

631
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:49,647
Agh! Aah!

632
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:52,840
Shoot it! Oh, my God!

633
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:56,563
Turn the boat around!

634
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:02,603
Head for shore!

635
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:20,963
- How is he?
- It's just a big cut.

636
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:23,361
- I'll stitch it up, he'll be all right.
- Oh, God.

637
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,690
- What's that?
- A plane.

638
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:31,041
- Good luck to them.
- Who are they?

639
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:35,330
I don't know, but the Zaire Air Force
has got a piece of their ass.

640
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:43,008
Pitch camp. Tomorrow, Mt. Mukenko.

641
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:05,120
- She's getting excited.
- Why, do you think?

642
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:08,961
Somewhere on the other side of this
mountain is where Amy was born.

643
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,207
Wow, it's beautiful.

644
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,004
Is this your valley, Amy?
It is, isn't it?

645
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,209
It's home. That's your home.

646
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:53,570
Pretty jungle, that's right.

647
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,690
What's she doing?

648
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:04,441
She wants to go to the place in her heart.

649
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:10,369
- You mean the place in your heart, Herkermer.
- You may call me Mr. Homolka.

650
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:14,201
Come on, Amy, let's go.

651
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:18,169
- We've lost two porters.
- Where'd they go?

652
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:21,767
- Ran away.
- And they didn't invite me?

653
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:25,527
You want your glove? All right, sit still.

654
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:35,611
This, as they say, is a fork in the road.
We could go left or we could go right.

655
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,922
We go the wrong way,
we lose two or three days.

656
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:40,726
We must follow the gorilla.
Where she leads.

657
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,204
- That would be left.
- Best guess...

658
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:46,362
off my last coordinates was this way.

659
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:51,447
- That would be right.
- Amy, Peter, <i>go</i> this way.

660
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:58,210
Well, I don't have her passion.
I'll follow the gorilla.

661
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:08,529
This doesn't seem
like the right way to me.

662
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:37,005
Good Lord.

663
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:44,646
- It's that plane we saw burning in
the sky. - Who were they?

664
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:48,407
Travis, my boss, thought I wasn't gonna
make it. He sent another expedition.

665
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:52,690
Tried to push too far. Looks like a rocket
got them. There's no point going in there.

666
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:58,804
- My God, what a waste of life.
- We'd better keep moving.

667
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:03,089
Keep it moving.

668
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:23,646
- Don't move.
- I know.

669
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:27,168
- If you run...
- He'll chase me, I know. I've read the books.

670
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:02,523
- You did good.
- Where did you go?

671
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:06,125
I ran away. Sorry.

672
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:12,444
- He looked right into my eyes.
- It's a silverback.

673
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:15,251
I never thought you could just
walk along and see them.

674
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:19,889
Amy.

675
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:35,520
<i>Hello. I'm Amy.
I'm Amy. Good, good, good. Amy.</i>

676
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:59,926
Here, let's take this off.

677
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:03,882
She doesn't really belong anywhere,
does she?

678
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:06,287
No, she belongs here.

679
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,402
- What the hell is that?
- Perimeter alarm.

680
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:30,921
They had it around their camp.

681
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:34,124
But where's the camp, their equipment?

682
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:56,407
I don't understand it. There had to be
300 pounds of equipment.

683
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:59,291
And the bodies.
There's no sign of the bodies.

684
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:29,931
- It's a dead end?
- Maybe, maybe not.

685
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,211
Yes. Bingo!

686
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:38,042
- Son of a bitch.
- Jesus.

687
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:40,168
What is this?

688
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:44,770
It is the city of Zinj...

689
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:50,885
that I have looked for all my life.

690
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:59,489
See, the eyes.

691
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:02,927
It is the same.

692
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:08,251
Kahega, guns up. Stay alert.

693
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:16,731
Come here, Amy. Stay with me.

694
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:10,931
First they found the diamonds,
Solomon's men.

695
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:16,082
A diamond mine of incredible bounty.

696
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:23,601
Then they built the city around
the mine, so that it should be protected.

697
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:27,044
The savagery of the guards was legend.

698
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:31,524
They instantly fell upon
any thief, any transgressor.

699
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:35,810
The diamonds flowed
to the kingdom of Solomon.

700
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:38,122
What happened? Why did the city die?

701
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:40,521
- I don't know.
- Maybe the mines ran dry.

702
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:43,843
No! No, the diamonds are here!

703
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:47,123
- Monroe, over here!
- What is it?

704
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:53,003
On the step, by the hood.

705
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:55,049
I found this.

706
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,729
Don't go in there. I'll check it out.

707
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:08,329
- Give me a gun and a flashlight.
- Don't be so John Wayne, you could get killed.

708
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:13,123
Now that I've said that,
I'm not going in there alone, either.

709
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:16,130
- I must go.
- Let's all look.

710
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:17,850
I'll just stay out here with Amy.

711
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,162
Not alone you won't. Kahega!

712
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:49,010
Stay close together. Homolka...

713
01:13:55,440 --> 01:14:00,446
- Homolka!
- The same hieroglyphics, over and over.

714
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:05,607
- What do they mean?
- Homolka!

715
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,371
Amy, don't wander off!

716
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:16,484
- So do you speak English?
- Yes.

717
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:19,287
- What's your name?
- Claude.

718
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:25,800
Claude? Heh. That's an unusual name for
somebody from, um... Where are you from?

719
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:30,682
- Mombasa.
- It's an unusual name for Mombasa.

720
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:36,327
- Have you ever been to Mombasa?
- Uh, no.

721
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:40,806
Then what do you know about it?

722
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:47,684
I want to go home.

723
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:53,931
Amy?

724
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:58,482
Amy, come here.

725
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:02,890
Where are you, girl?
Come on, I'm not fooling around.

726
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:07,200
Amy.

727
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:09,884
Amy?

728
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:15,927
Come here, girl. Amy.

729
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:30,009
Charles!

730
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:33,930
Charlie!

731
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,207
- What are those holes?
- Lava tubes.

732
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:41,250
Molten rock must be flowing
through this whole place.

733
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:43,801
This must lead to the mine.

734
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:48,921
Please, bring a light.

735
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:52,451
Here.

736
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:58,607
Now here. Come on.

737
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:02,082
Up here. No...!

738
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:05,841
- That's not going anywhere.
- Where could they be? What happened?

739
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:11,369
Shit! Let's get out of
here while we still can.

740
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:12,521
Help me!

741
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:15,761
- What's that?
- Richard!

742
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:19,370
- Richard?
- Help me!

743
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:23,170
Help me!

744
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:26,609
- Richard!
- Let me go! Let me go!

745
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:29,881
No! Richard! Oh, my God! Something...

746
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:04,565
- Richard.
- Come on.

747
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:06,842
Let's get out of here.

748
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:13,251
- It's okay.
- Peter.

749
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:30,600
They're gorillas.
They're some kind of gorillas.

750
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:38,047
I never saw an animal move like
that. They just... Look. They just kill.

751
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:43,047
That's why the diamonds were never
found. The myth of the killer ape is true.

752
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,884
I can't believe it.

753
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,402
<i>Bad gorillas.</i>

754
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:17,689
Let me turn your volume down.

755
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:23,443
Here's your lovey.

756
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:28,284
Shh.

757
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:32,764
<i>- It's</i> okay.
<i>- Mother. Mother.</i>

758
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:34,365
Yes, you're okay now.

759
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:47,246
- See anything?
- No, but I'm the last line of defense.

760
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:50,051
They have sensor-operated machine pistols
on tripods.

761
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:52,971
Anything comes within 40 ft.,
get ready to the 4th of July.

762
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:55,367
What can I say, you
really know how to pack.

763
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:08,442
- I don't see anything.
- Put that out.

764
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:31,323
They're testing their perimeter.

765
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:41,005
How intelligent are they?

766
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:43,527
Gorillas are very smart,
but they're not aggressive.

767
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:47,241
- These things are very aggressive.
- I'd say they're smart. Too damn smart.

768
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:50,370
They're out there, but what are they doing?

769
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:52,326
Monroe!

770
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,240
Get down!

771
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:06,010
- They're gone.
- Couple of hours until first light.

772
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:08,208
Then we're out of here.

773
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:16,004
Those hieroglyphics
we saw inscribed everywhere?

774
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:18,721
- I have translated them.
- What do they say?

775
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:22,930
"We are watching you."

776
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:39,649
We must have hit some of them.
Where are the bodies?

777
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:41,768
- Have you seen Amy? She's gone.
- No.

778
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:46,608
She's joined the club, then. We've got two
porters missing and Homolka's run off, too.

779
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:50,606
- I'm going to find her.
- People come first, then gorillas.

780
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:52,131
- Do you agree?
- Yes.

781
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:57,241
Good. We'll retrieve our comrades,
then we'll retrieve your missing gorilla.

782
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:01,007
Then we'll get the hell out of here.
Mount up!

783
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:11,011
What's that?

784
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:32,364
- Peter, take this.
- I don't like guns.

785
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:34,648
I didn't ask if you like it. Take it.

786
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:44,449
Here's the story.
They domesticated gorillas.

787
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:47,365
You call that
domesticated? They're killing a man.

788
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:52,048
They taught them to be this way.
They bred them to violence.

789
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:55,409
They looked for the trait
and they encouraged it.

790
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:59,282
Guard dogs, and they
turned on their masters.

791
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:03,322
What's that smell?

792
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:07,009
These are all the bones of gorillas.

793
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:10,369
- You mean, these are...?
- No, these are normal gorillas.

794
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:15,605
- This one's skull was crushed.
- Feel that?

795
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:16,921
Feel what?

796
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,445
Hang on!

797
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:45,728
- Everybody okay?
- Yeah, let's go.

798
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:52,526
Don't go this way. It's all caved in.
God, I'm so glad to see you.

799
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:56,765
- I was trying to find the mines...
- Be quiet. Got any flares, Kahega?

800
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:58,331
Yeah!

801
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,731
- What's making my eyes burn?
- Sulfur fumes.

802
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:06,167
Let's hope there's another way out of here.

803
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:21,005
Careful.

804
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:45,808
- What the hell...?
- It's the mines!

805
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:50,807
"We are watching you." It's the trainers
talking. The teacher is watching you.

806
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:52,845
Dead teachers.

807
01:25:58,240 --> 01:25:59,446
Look.

808
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:09,282
Yes, yes, yes. I knew it was true!

809
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:14,486
The city of Zinj, the diamonds...

810
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:23,206
Every word of it was absolutely true.

811
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:27,209
I'd leave those alone.

812
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:36,484
- Any other way out of here?
- Not that I've noticed.

813
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:41,204
Help me. Fill up everything.

814
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:54,844
- You've got to get me out of here!
- Take a number.

815
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:58,129
- But we're going to be rich!
- ls that a way out?

816
01:26:58,280 --> 01:26:59,327
Maybe.

817
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:35,970
Look out!

818
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:00,127
- Let's go.
- Stay close together.

819
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:10,850
- What is it?
- It's a geode. A giant diamond.

820
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:16,406
- They cut him off. Kahega!
- Check if there's a way out back there.

821
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:27,484
Kahega!

822
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:54,009
Jeffrey...

823
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:57,444
Charlie!

824
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:00,045
Charlie!

825
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:03,243
- It's him?
- It's him.

826
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:09,930
Come on.

827
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:26,126
- Is there a way out back there?
- No, nothing.

828
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:31,605
- We're almost out of rounds.
- Buy me two minutes.

829
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:00,520
Let me try.

830
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:03,570
Aah!

831
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:37,361
Ugly gorillas. Ugly. Go</i> away.

832
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:43,482
They don't know what to make of it.

833
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:57,847
<i>- Amy.
- Mother. Mother.</i>

834
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:06,765
- Peter hug <i>Amy.</i>
- Maternal instinct, long may she reign.

835
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:09,571
- What are you doing?
- What am I doing? I'll tell you.

836
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:11,643
- We're getting out.
- What about them?

837
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:14,610
Put them on
the endangered species list.

838
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:25,731
Come on, Monroe. Let's go! Move!

839
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:29,009
- What the hell is that?
- The latest thing in communication.

840
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:31,083
- Climb!
- Up here.

841
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:35,651
- Go! Go!
- Come on.

842
01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:15,291
Come on!

843
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:24,248
Come on, girl. Come on!

844
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:36,606
GO, Amy!

845
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:00,929
Keep going!

846
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:06,011
- Unh.
- Come on, come on.

847
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:11,040
Wait!

848
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:15,569
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

849
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:36,490
Hang on!

850
01:33:40,160 --> 01:33:42,049
Watch out!

851
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:46,565
- Go, Amy!
- Hurry!

852
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:49,650
Just hurry! Come on!

853
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:00,524
- Come on!
- You can do it!

854
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:03,566
Keep moving.

855
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:06,324
Head for higher ground.

856
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:08,929
Keep going, Amy!

857
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:42,723
Should be a big yellow case
with a red stripe on that plane.

858
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:45,770
It's a balloon. I'll get the transmitter.

859
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:48,886
Amy!

860
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:55,324
Amy!

861
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:58,562
- How close is the border?
- Not far.

862
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:00,643
This is Karen Ross, 81452.

863
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:06,051
That is KR 81452.
Houston, Travis, do you read?

864
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:09,283
<i>KR 81452.</i>

865
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:12,011
Houston, Travis, do you read?

866
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:19,129
81452, that is KR 81452.
Houston, Travis, do you read?

867
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:25,206
- Karen, is that you?
<i>- It's</i> me, Travis.

868
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:28,370
I thought I'd lost you.
I sent another expedition.

869
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:34,687
<i>- Did</i> you get <i>it?</i>
- I have bad news. Charles was killed.

870
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:39,563
Did you get the diamond? Did you?

871
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:47,170
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Good girl.

872
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:55,049
Do you remember when I told you
that if I ever knew you sent me here...

873
01:35:55,200 --> 01:36:00,001
for some diamond,
and not for Charlie, I'd make you sorry?

874
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:03,370
<i>Karen, of course I'm upset.</i>

875
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:08,651
<i>- But what's done is done. I could...</i>
- I <i>know. You need</i> a <i>new</i> cash <i>machine.</i>

876
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:10,529
<i>What would happen to the satellite...</i>

877
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:13,684
if I put its phone number in the laser
and pulled the trigger?

878
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:16,923
The chip from the transmitter's
got the satellite's number.

879
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:26,962
It's a 12,000 channel chip.
If you put it through the diamond... Karen!

880
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:33,883
This is for you, Charlie.

881
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:39,131
No!

882
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:43,726
Amy!

883
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:48,165
There you are.

884
01:36:57,240 --> 01:36:59,481
Amy, you saved me.

885
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:03,730
It's okay.

886
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:22,970
Thank you.

887
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:29,088
I love you, too.

888
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:32,610
Mother?

889
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:38,725
Oh, I see. It's Africa. It's your mother.

890
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:43,803
Amy, where did you go?

891
01:37:45,680 --> 01:37:49,207
Good gorillas? What good gorillas?

892
01:37:57,680 --> 01:37:58,920
Handsome fella.

893
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:26,250
Amy...

894
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:35,406
Look at that.
ls that Amy with the...?

895
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:39,246
The silverback. So she's...

896
01:38:41,240 --> 01:38:44,289
I see. I see.

897
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:50,363
She's home.

898
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:10,081
- Will she be all right?
- They know what to do.

899
01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:11,526
It's us I'm worried about.

900
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:15,287
- We've got to go. Come on.
- Bye, Amy.

901
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:53,006
- Peter, would you do me a favor?
- What?

902
01:39:53,160 --> 01:39:55,083
Would you throw this away for me.

903
01:39:55,880 --> 01:39:57,530
You sure?

904
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:01,761
Ouch.

905
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:12,126
- There's a wind.
- I hope it blows us someplace good.

906
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:13,930
Me too.
