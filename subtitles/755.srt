1
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,240
You hungry?

2
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,560
You know you've
got to come get it,

3
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,840
don't play hard to get.

4
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,920
You will like it.

5
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,640
It's cat...

6
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,480
There you go.

7
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,280
Leave room
for breakfast.

8
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,640
<i>I can think of
younger days</i>

9
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,120
<i>when living for my life</i>

10
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:26,320
<i>Was everything a man
could want to do</i>

11
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:37,240
<i>I could never
see tomorrow</i>

12
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,840
<i>I was never told</i>

13
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:47,800
<i>about the sorrow</i>

14
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,440
<i>How can you mend</i>

15
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,280
<i>a broken heart?</i>

16
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,000
<i>How can you
stop the rain</i>

17
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,200
<i> from falling down?</i>

18
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,400
<i>How can you stop</i>

19
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,800
<i>the sun from shining?</i>

20
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:28,200
<i>What makes the
world go round?</i>

21
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,000
Hello?

22
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,680
Hello?

23
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,600
Please...

24
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,360
don't hurt me.

25
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,200
Here, take anything
you want.

26
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,640
Frozen food.

27
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,640
Take it.

28
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,560
- I'm not gonna hurt you.
- Yeah?

29
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,720
That's what the
last guys said.

30
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,800
Could you help me?

31
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,600
The wheel came off.

32
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,920
I can't fix it.

33
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,360
Maybe if I...
if I could...

34
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,360
but I can't.

35
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,000
The only good thing
about no soap

36
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Is that you can smell
hijackers a mile off.

37
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,080
I am impressed!

38
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,000
This lad...

39
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,880
smelled us...

40
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,120
from thirty feet away!

41
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,880
What does that say
about our hygiene?

42
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,560
What you got there
in that pack?

43
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,480
What pack?

44
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,760
He's got a gun.

45
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,440
Well shit, it
ain't loaded.

46
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,400
They never are.

47
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,520
Ain't that right,
old man?

48
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,960
Open the pack and
tip it out on the road,

49
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,360
nice and slow.

50
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,840
Can't do that.

51
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,440
Take off the
fucking pack...

52
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,080
and put it on
the ground...

53
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,800
or die!

54
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,520
Are you listening to me?

55
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,560
- I am now.
- Good.

56
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,840
- Are you listening to me?
- Yeah.

57
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,240
Good.

58
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,320
Put that hand
on me again,

59
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,960
and you wont
get it back.

60
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,760
Can you believe
this fucking guy?

61
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,200
Alright, we will do
it the hard way.

62
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,360
Why did you do that?

63
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,640
Did you cut my
hand off?

64
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,600
What are you standing
around for?

65
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,600
Kiss him!

66
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,040
What did he say?

67
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,040
He's in shock.

68
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,400
I think he meant
"Kill him".

69
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,880
I told you you weren't
gonna get that back.

70
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,000
Yeah, you did.

71
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,440
Who are you?

72
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,800
Where's your water?

73
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,160
They have none, they
were gonna take you up,

74
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,920
and then eat you.

75
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,800
It's true.

76
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,600
It's in the cart.

77
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,760
You gonna take any?

78
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,120
- Where are you going?
- West.

79
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,080
- Can I come with you?
- No.

80
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,760
<i>No!</i>

81
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,440
<i>Woah, woah, woah...
Where are you going?</i>

82
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,920
Stay on the path.

83
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,400
<i>No!</i>

84
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,840
Stay on the path,
it's not your concern.

85
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:50,800
Stay on the path,
it's not your concern.

86
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,880
- I don't know you.
- I'm not from around here.

87
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,560
No shit. Who are you?

88
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,960
I don't want any trouble.

89
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,120
Okay.

90
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,360
- Just a customer, okay?
- Okay.

91
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,240
I'm sorry I gotta
see the hands.

92
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,520
I'm not one of them.

93
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Okay.

94
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,960
I'm gonna take something
out of my pack.

95
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,720
Take your finger
off the trigger.

96
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,960
Oh, sweet. That's
a Phantom 900, man.

97
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,240
Is it?

98
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,320
I haven't seen one of
those since the 90's.

99
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,600
Yeah, I got it
back east.

100
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,120
- Does it still work?
- Yeah, just need a charge,

101
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,840
can you do that
for me? A charge.

102
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,600
I got cables.

103
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,360
I don't need cables,
I can charge it for you,

104
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,720
if you got the coin.

105
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,720
Yes I do.

106
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,680
- It's American.
- Oh yeah.

107
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,280
I got a whole
bunch of these.

108
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,080
How about Chapstick,
got any Chapstick?

109
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,160
No Chapstick.
I got cat oil.

110
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,040
- Fresh cat oil.
- No, no.

111
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,320
It's good, it's good for...

112
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,240
works the same way.

113
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,720
What about toys,
got any toys?

114
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,880
No, I don't play.
Oh, I got...

115
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,960
Oh yeah.
Yeah yeah.

116
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,400
Okay, alright.

117
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,680
I'll have this,
with these.

118
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,520
Oh, absolutely,
those are yours.

119
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,800
Okay, give me a
couple of hours.

120
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,640
- I'll charge it up for you
- Thank you.

121
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,640
You can wait over there,
across the street.

122
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,200
- No, I'm good.
- Bar is about to open.

123
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,400
I'll wait here.

124
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,280
You dont trust
me, do you?

125
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,000
- I'll wait here.
- Alright.

126
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:41,240
Carnie, one of the road
crews just pulled into town.

127
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,480
They got something
for you.

128
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,800
- Books?
- A whole pack of them.

129
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,200
Tell them I wanna
see them. Right now.

130
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,800
We did good.

131
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:21,520
The one you want.
It ain't there?

132
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,680
No.

133
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,640
I just dont understand.
That's a shitload of books.

134
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,960
You don't have
to understand.

135
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,040
I understand.

136
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,880
Leave that to me and
we can be friends.

137
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,640
I have faith in you,
you will find it.

138
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,400
Ah, wait!

139
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,440
I got this too.

140
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,840
Oh, now this is a treat.

141
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,560
It's a schampoo.

142
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,840
Go get slammed.
Get some pussy.

143
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,560
On me as much as you
and your boys can stand.

144
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,240
Then go back
on the road.

145
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,960
Then we'll get
you your book!

146
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,160
Of that I have no doubt.

147
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,480
You're sending guys out
that can't even read

148
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,800
to look for one book.

149
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,040
No wonder they
never find anything.

150
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,600
unless you'd like
to go with them.

151
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,280
- What about these?
- Burn them.

152
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,120
The place across the street.
They got any water?

153
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,680
They have if you
can pay for it.

154
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:05,520
Here. Smell this.

155
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,600
One of the road
crews found it.

156
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,840
Who knows...

157
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:22,680
Might be the last
schampoo on the planet.

158
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:27,080
And it's all yours.

159
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,720
Did they find your book?

160
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,040
No.

161
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,440
Outlander?

162
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,280
Let me see.

163
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,720
- Alright, what will it be?
- Water.

164
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,440
That's the good stuff.

165
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,160
I gotta eat into my
own rations to sell,

166
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,360
so it don't
come cheap.

167
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,480
That will get you
maybe half way.

168
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,480
Solara!

169
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,560
Get this and
get it filled.

170
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,000
Wait. You need this.

171
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,480
Can you please move?

172
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,520
Thank you.

173
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,800
That was my cat.

174
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,880
Fine specimen.

175
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,840
I saw you knock
him off the bar.

176
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,760
No, I kinda shoo'd it,
I didnt really knock it.

177
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,280
You raised your
hand at him.

178
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,400
Won't happen again,
I promise you.

179
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,560
Hey Martz, how about
another drink?

180
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,560
That cat's been coming
in here for 2 years.

181
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,520
It's got more right to
be here than you.

182
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,600
I don't want any trouble.

183
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,880
That's too bad,
cause you...

184
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,120
I know who you are.

185
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:52,680
Murderer of innocent
travelers on the road.

186
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,800
You are going to be
held in account

187
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,920
for the things you've
done, do you know that?

188
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,440
It's okay.

189
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:13,600
I'm gonna grab my things,
and walk out of here.

190
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,880
- Alright, brother?
- Yeah.

191
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:02,000
Cursed be the ground,
for our sake.

192
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:10,240
Of thorns and thistles, it
shall bring forth, for us.

193
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,840
For out of the ground
we were taken

194
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,000
for the dust we are.

195
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,960
And to the dust
we shall return.

196
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,640
Stop!

197
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,760
Please.

198
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,400
Redridge!

199
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,920
Redridge.

200
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:27,460
- And who are you?
- Nobody.

201
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,740
Oh, I doubt that.

202
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:33,500
The men you
killed in my bar.

203
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,100
They were nobody.

204
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,420
- But you now...
- He ain't got the shakes.

205
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,380
He ain't one of them.

206
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,700
Good. This is a
civilized town.

207
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,700
We don't eat humans.

208
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,420
We don't see too many
people from before.

209
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,180
Not anymore.

210
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:55,700
- Do you read?
- Every day.

211
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,820
How good for you.
Me too.

212
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,340
You know whats funny?

213
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:04,860
As old as we are,
people like you and me,

214
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,380
we're the future.

215
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,620
What do you
want with me?

216
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:12,060
Straight to the point.

217
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,180
I like that.

218
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,940
You're not just educated.

219
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,820
I never saw anyone handle
themselves the way you did

220
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,140
I dont know where
you learned it,

221
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:29,860
but I sure as hell
could use it.

222
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:34,620
It's a little town,
just the beginning.

223
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:37,780
Im about to expand,
I need expert help,

224
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,460
I could use
someone like you.

225
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:42,860
Thank you. But I'm
really not interested.

226
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,820
People who work for
me live better than

227
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,980
any worker dreamed.
Ask Redrige, here.

228
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,100
Ask the boys, anyone.

229
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:52,500
Real beds, hot food,
women.

230
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:57,060
Clean water.

231
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:00,220
You could do a lot
worse, my friend.

232
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,860
Thank you.

233
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,580
But I got somewhere
I need to be.

234
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,340
Where?

235
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,820
West.

236
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,060
There is nothing west.

237
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,180
I've been told
different.

238
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,940
By who?

239
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:25,660
Tell you what.
Stay the night.

240
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,140
Try a little of
our hospitality,

241
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,820
see how you like it.

242
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,380
We'll talk again
in the morning.

243
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:34,820
Word of advice, Walker.
It's not a choice.

244
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,900
There's always
a choice.

245
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:45,860
There'll be someone
outside your room all night.

246
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:49,820
- If you need anything.
- I dont need anything.

247
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,700
You never know.

248
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:46,300
This is for you. It's
water for washing

249
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,820
and some food, some
special dessert too,

250
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,740
compliments
of the house.

251
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,860
I need you to take
this or say something,

252
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,580
so I can find you.

253
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:14,420
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

254
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,740
Can I get you
anything else?

255
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,340
No, I'm fine,
thank you.

256
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,780
You get blinded
in the war?

257
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:25,580
I was born this way.

258
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,220
I think probably I'm
lucky because I was

259
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,100
already used to being
like this by the time

260
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,340
it happened.

261
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:34,660
Well, thank you,
for the food.

262
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,060
You're welcome.

263
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,380
I like your perfume.

264
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:50,260
It's just shampoo.
But thank you.

265
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,380
Good night.

266
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,700
I don't think he'll
change his mind

267
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,380
by the morning.

268
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,740
He's not gonna stay.

269
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,380
He's different than
the others.

270
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,500
You're not gonna be
able to make him do

271
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,740
what you want
him to do.

272
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:39,740
Who said anything
about me?

273
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:44,340
I'll send Solara.

274
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,460
You can't do that.

275
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:54,020
It's about time I got
better use out of her.

276
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:59,220
Dont... Please.

277
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:03,140
Please, dont. Please.

278
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,380
Can I come in?

279
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,580
Give me a minute.

280
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:37,140
Somebody already came
with food and water.

281
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,260
I got everything
I need.

282
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,340
Are you sure
about that?

283
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,700
It's really
bright in here.

284
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:57,980
- I'm Solara.
- Right

285
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:00,740
You filled my canteen
downstairs.

286
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:04,260
Yeah. You're that
Walker, right?

287
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,260
Right.

288
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:13,460
If you're worried about
paying its on the house.

289
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,340
Paying for what?

290
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,580
Why don't you
take a seat?

291
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,420
No.

292
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,660
No, I can't go.

293
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,700
If I do he will
hurt my mom.

294
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,980
- Who?
- Carnegie.

295
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:44,700
- He's your father?`
- No

296
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,260
We belong to him
just the same.

297
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,420
I'll sleep on
the floor.

298
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,460
Tomorrow you can
tell him you had

299
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:54,740
a good time. I promise,
I will be no trouble.

300
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,500
Please.

301
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:11,020
Knight to b4.

302
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,820
Your move.

303
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:31,100
- So... how old are you?
- Excuse me?

304
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,020
I havent really seen
too many people

305
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:35,620
your age come
through here before.

306
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:39,820
Well, it's been...

307
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:46,260
30 winters since
the flash.

308
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,940
I really dont remember.

309
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,420
Do you remember
what it was like?

310
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:57,260
- In the world before.
- Yeah

311
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,900
What was it like?

312
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:09,380
People had more
than they needed.

313
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:16,580
We had no idea what was
precious and what wasn't.

314
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,300
We threw away things
that people would

315
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,260
kill each other for now.

316
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,420
- Really?
- Yeah.

317
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,860
You have a book.
Can I see it?

318
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,140
No, you cannot.

319
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:36,540
I just want to
look at it.

320
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:40,420
I can't even read, please
let me just see it.

321
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,980
What is with you?
It is just a book.

322
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,300
It's not just a book.

323
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,940
What do you mean
it's not just a book?

324
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,540
No more questions
about the book, okay?

325
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,820
No more questions.

326
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:20,100
I got a question for you,
since you're here.

327
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:23,260
Maybe I'll answer it,
maybe I won't.

328
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:26,420
Where do you get
your water?

329
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,860
I can't tell you that.

330
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,740
You can't tell me
or you dont know?

331
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:32,700
Oh, I know.

332
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:36,220
But if you're not
talking about the book,

333
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:39,460
I'm not talking
about the water.

334
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:46,340
Alright, I got another
question for you.

335
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:47,660
Great.

336
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:52,660
Yeah, there's a lot
of food there.

337
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:54,340
More than I can eat.

338
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:58,260
Tell you what. We
can share it,

339
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:02,540
like old people used to.

340
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:07,220
- Okay.
- Okay?

341
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:14,980
Wait a minute.
Sit.

342
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:17,860
Sit down.

343
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:24,900
Give me your hands.

344
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,540
What are you doing?

345
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,780
Trust me, give me
your hands.

346
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:35,380
Close your eyes.

347
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:40,540
Dear Lord, we thank
you for this meal.

348
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:44,460
We thank you for
a warm bed and

349
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,620
roof over our head
on cold nights,

350
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:47,940
such as this.

351
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:53,260
- It's gone too long.
- Is this from the book?

352
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:56,940
Close your eyes.

353
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:02,820
We thank you for the
gift of companionship,

354
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:05,540
in hard times
like these.

355
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:07,140
Amen.

356
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:13,540
Now we eat?

357
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:16,060
Now we eat.

358
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:48,420
Morning, Solara.

359
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:53,380
How was your night,
did you sleep well?

360
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:55,860
- I did what you said.
- Of course you did,

361
00:45:55,860 --> 00:46:01,100
but I said:
Did it work?

362
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:05,660
- Is he staying?
- We didn't talk much.

363
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:08,020
Solara, honey,
eat something.

364
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:14,260
Mom, give me your hand.

365
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:17,820
Close your eyes.

366
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:20,420
Mom, trust me.

367
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:28,620
Dear Lord.

368
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:33,340
We thank you
for our food.

369
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:37,660
Thank you for
my mother.

370
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:39,580
Thank you for the
roof over our heads.

371
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:46,900
And...

372
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:54,020
Well I guess thats
all for now.

373
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,340
Amen.

374
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:03,460
That's the word
you're looking for.

375
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:04,740
Amen.

376
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:09,060
That's how you stop.

377
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:17,380
You said you
didn't talk much.

378
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:22,620
But did he do
any reading?

379
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:27,060
- I asked you a question.
- Bill, don't.

380
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:30,820
You shut your mouth.

381
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:41,660
Stop!

382
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:45,100
You're hurting your
mother, Solara.

383
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:48,820
He said he read
every day. Did he?

384
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:54,260
Your mother, would
like you to talk.

385
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:55,540
I dont know!

386
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:57,700
I dont know.

387
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:07,180
Yes, okay. Yes,
he was reading.

388
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:08,900
What kind of book
was he reading?

389
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:11,180
I don't know, an
old leather one.

390
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,460
And?

391
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:17,980
I don't know, it had
some thing on the front.

392
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:18,820
Tell me.

393
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:20,300
I need you to
let her go.

394
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,700
Show me!

395
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:37,500
Redridge!

396
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:52,740
Shit! I stayed
up all night.

397
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:55,140
Where is he?

398
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:57,340
I dont...

399
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:03,500
I just want to
make sure...

400
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,500
...there's no
acid in there.

401
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:08,140
Doesn't matter, just
take these off.

402
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:09,860
- Take them off.
- Let me dry...

403
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:11,180
- Hey!
- Alright!

404
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,500
Thank you. You can tell
them I made you do it.

405
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:18,780
- Say it.
- You made me do it.

406
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,140
Is that thing loaded?

407
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:48,420
I don't think
it's loaded.

408
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:50,740
Only one way
to find out.

409
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:54,460
Look, I need
that book.

410
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:58,340
I mean I want
the book. And you.

411
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:00,580
If you make
me choose,

412
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:03,180
I'll kill you,
I'll take the book.

413
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:06,980
Why, why do
you want it?

414
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:13,580
I grew up with it.
I know its power.

415
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:16,540
And if you read it,
then so do you.

416
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:20,820
That's why they burned
them all after the war.

417
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:24,340
Just staying alive
is an act of faith,

418
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:25,820
building this town
is an even bigger

419
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:29,460
act of faith. But they
don't understand that.

420
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,540
None of them do.

421
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:34,740
And I dont have the
words to help them,

422
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,940
but the book does.

423
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:41,980
And I admit...

424
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:44,220
I've had to do things,
many many things,

425
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:47,180
I hate to ***,
I confess that.

426
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:52,140
But if we had
that book,

427
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:53,140
I wouldn't have to.

428
00:50:55,180 --> 00:51:00,260
Can you imagine how
different, how righteous

429
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:01,940
this little world
could be if we had

430
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:03,940
the right words
for our faith.

431
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:05,300
The people would truly
understand why

432
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,620
they're here and what
they're doing,

433
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:10,180
they wouldn't need any
other uglier motivations.

434
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:14,060
It's not right to keep
that book hidden away,

435
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:17,100
it's meant to be
shared with others.

436
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:20,180
Meant to be spread.

437
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:21,660
Isn't that what
you want?

438
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:24,940
Of all my heart
and soul.

439
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:28,780
I always believed that
I'd find a place where

440
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:34,420
this book belongs,
where it was needed.

441
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:38,500
Well, I haven't
found it yet.

442
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:46,500
I love this guy.

443
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:53,060
I love this guy.

444
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:00,060
Shoot him. Please.

445
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:23,660
What are you
standing around for?

446
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:27,340
Take him out,
god damn it!

447
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:33,420
I don't like being followed.

448
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:35,900
I wanna come with you.

449
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:39,060
- Are you dumb?
- I hate it here.

450
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:41,780
Then change it.

451
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:44,100
My mother thinks I'll
be safer with you.

452
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:52,540
I'll take you to where
we get our water.

453
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:55,740
You can have all
that you can carry.

454
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:07,260
I mean all that
we can carry.

455
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:15,300
Carnegie knows about two
more springs up North.

456
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,940
He says he's gonna
build more towns.

457
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:21,460
How did he know
about this one?

458
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:25,100
He's been here.
When he was young.

459
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:29,100
In the world before.

460
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:32,300
I guess everyone else
who knew about it died.

461
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:36,860
We really better hurry.

462
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:43,180
I think I left my
glasses inside.

463
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:45,820
can you take a
look for me?

464
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:53,980
What are you doing?

465
00:55:57,260 --> 00:55:59,580
You are such a liar.

466
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,140
I'm not a liar.

467
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:05,260
You said I could
come with you,

468
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:06,980
if you got your water.

469
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:09,860
I didn't say that,
you said that.

470
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:12,340
Besides, the road's
no place for you.

471
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:14,900
Much worse than
you think.

472
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:17,380
Good bye, Solara.

473
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:18,660
Nice knowing you,
I mean that.

474
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:21,660
- Hey.
- Yeah?

475
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:22,940
Fuck you!

476
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,540
You washed your
filthy fucking hands?

477
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:44,100
Twice, Sir.
With your soap.

478
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:49,820
Put a crew together,
we're going after them.

479
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:55,020
- For a fucking book.
- It's not a fucking book!

480
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:57,380
It's a weapon!

481
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:00,900
A weapon that aims
right at the hearts

482
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:02,780
and minds of the
weak and desperate.

483
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:06,340
It will give us
control of them!

484
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:10,660
If we wanna rule more
than one fucking town

485
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:13,140
we have to have it.

486
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:15,140
People will come from
all over and do exactly

487
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:21,020
what I tell them if the
words are from the book.

488
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:28,300
It's happened before,
and it will happen again.

489
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:31,180
All we need is that book.

490
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:47,420
Then I want Solara.

491
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:54,940
Are you bargaining
with me?

492
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:58,460
Is this a deal
we're making?

493
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:02,700
We lost a lot of men.

494
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:05,220
You need me
more than ever.

495
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:09,020
Now you say that book
is worth the trouble.

496
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:12,340
Well I believe you.

497
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:15,140
But I want Solara for it.

498
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:30,660
Why not?
Why not.

499
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:34,260
Let's get the
fuck out of here.

500
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:09,620
Which way are
we heading?

501
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:11,820
West.

502
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:52,540
Hello?

503
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:56,140
Can anyone help me?

504
00:59:57,300 --> 01:00:00,180
Hello, is anybody there?

505
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:10,580
Are you okay?

506
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:14,900
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

507
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:17,780
You go along,
I'll be okay.

508
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,980
- Let me just...
- No! Really, please!

509
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:24,020
I'm fine, really. I need
a man to help me...

510
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:26,540
You just go along.

511
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:28,140
It's okay, it will just
take a minute.

512
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:31,580
I'm fine. Please...

513
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:56,140
Help!

514
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,620
Get off me!

515
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:17,620
Hold them there.

516
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:29,700
- What's wrong?
- Did you hear that?

517
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:39,580
Don't move.

518
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:59,460
Take the wire off
of that. Spool it up.

519
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:02,660
- What is that?
- Dinner.

520
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:25,060
It's like if he's
protected somehow.

521
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:26,060
Like there's nothing
that can touch him.

522
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:32,660
He's just a fucking man.

523
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:36,980
You put a bullet in him
and he will go down.

524
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:44,380
Still warm.

525
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:50,300
No more than a
few hours dead.

526
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:55,780
He can't be far.

527
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:05,540
Son of a bitch.

528
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:09,900
Solara.

529
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:13,220
You sure you
still want her?

530
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:19,060
It's gonna be
dark soon.

531
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:19,860
We can't track
them at night,

532
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:21,180
they'll see us coming.

533
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:26,460
We'll drive right past
them and never know it.

534
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:27,460
He's right.

535
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:32,300
They're on foot. Tired.
They'll have to sleep.

536
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:36,020
We'll make up the
ground tomorrow.

537
01:05:36,020 --> 01:05:38,180
We'll have them
before morning, Sam.

538
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:42,820
That better be
a guarantee.

539
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:02,060
Do you really read the
same book every day?

540
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:03,340
Without fail.

541
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:09,660
Will you read
some to me?

542
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:13,540
Please.

543
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:25,820
The lord is my shepard.
I shall not want;

544
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:31,140
He makes me to lie down
in green pastures.

545
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:34,460
He leads me beside
still waters;

546
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:38,220
He restores my soul.

547
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:41,340
He leadeth me in paths
of righteousness

548
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:42,620
for His name's sake.

549
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:47,940
Even though I walk
through the valley

550
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:50,500
of the shadow
of death,

551
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:53,540
I will fear no evil;

552
01:06:53,540 --> 01:06:54,540
for Thou art with me

553
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:59,100
- That's beautiful.
- You like that?

554
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:02,380
- Did you write that?
- Yes I did.

555
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:05,740
- Really?
- No.

556
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:09,140
That was around
a long time before

557
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:11,780
you and I got here,
thats for sure.

558
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:18,860
What did you mean
when you said it's

559
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:20,140
not just any book?

560
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:32,220
It's the only one.

561
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:36,420
Really?

562
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:38,260
After the war people
made it their business

563
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:42,540
to find and destroy any
that the fires didn't get,

564
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:43,620
some people say this
was the reason

565
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:45,180
for the war in
the first place.

566
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:52,100
Anyway, it's the only
one that survived.

567
01:07:54,380 --> 01:07:56,340
How did you get it?

568
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:06,060
They said that the war,
tore a hole in the sky.

569
01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:07,660
You probably
heard the stories.

570
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:08,660
Yeah.

571
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:13,620
Tore a hole in the sky,
sun came down,

572
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:15,140
and burned everything.

573
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:18,020
Everything and
everybody.

574
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:20,540
You were lucky, to
hole up and hide in

575
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:23,580
a place like this,
or underground.

576
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:27,500
Most people
weren't lucky.

577
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:34,940
So, a year later we
started coming out,

578
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:38,580
wandering around,
didn't know what to do,

579
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:42,500
just trying to find a
place to survive.

580
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:48,020
One day, I heard a voice.
It's hard to explain,

581
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:53,820
but it was like if it was
coming from inside me.

582
01:08:53,820 --> 01:08:58,660
But I could hear it as
clear as I can hear you.

583
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:01,060
What did the voice say?

584
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:06,460
It led me. To a place
where I found the book.

585
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:09,540
Buried, under some rubble.

586
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:17,580
The voice told me to
carry the book out West.

587
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:21,300
It told me a path had
been laid out for me,

588
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:25,100
that I'd be led to a
place where the book

589
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:26,420
would be safe.

590
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:33,220
Told me that I'd
be protected,

591
01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:38,940
against anything that
stood in my path.

592
01:09:39,860 --> 01:09:42,380
I've been walking
ever since.

593
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:44,980
And you did all that
because a voice

594
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:47,140
in your head told
you to.

595
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:50,140
Yes, I did.

596
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:55,220
I know what I heard.
I know what I hear.

597
01:09:56,220 --> 01:09:59,500
And I know I would
have never made it,

598
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:01,420
without help.

599
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:04,860
- What's that?
- One question too many.

600
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:07,380
Go to bed, we've got an
early start in the morning.

601
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:12,220
What are you doing?

602
01:11:12,220 --> 01:11:13,700
I'm sorry, I thought
you were sleeping.

603
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:17,340
I wasn't sleeping.
What are you doing?

604
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:18,860
I just wanted to
see the book.

605
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:22,460
Nobody touches it but
me, you understand?

606
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:26,700
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, I understand.

607
01:11:36,740 --> 01:11:38,060
since you don't know
how to read anyway,

608
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:39,780
it's of no use to you.

609
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:41,060
Yeah.

610
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:44,100
So teach me.

611
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:06,020
Hold on. Hold up.
Stop!

612
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:14,980
You say you've been
walking for 30 years.

613
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:17,500
Have you ever thought
maybe you were lost?

614
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:18,780
No.

615
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:21,060
How do you know you're
walking in the right direction?

616
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:23,700
I walk by faith,
not by sight.

617
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:27,260
- What does that mean?
- It means you know something,

618
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:29,620
even if you don't
know something.

619
01:12:29,620 --> 01:12:30,740
It doesn't make
any sense.

620
01:12:30,740 --> 01:12:33,540
It doesn't have to
make sense. It's faith.

621
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:36,100
Its a flower of light,
in a field of darkness,

622
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:38,340
giving me the strength
to carry on, understand?

623
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:39,820
Is that from
your book?

624
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:44,420
No, it's Johnny Cash...

625
01:12:44,420 --> 01:12:45,740
What?

626
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,040
Do you think anyone
lives there?

627
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,360
I dont know.

628
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:15,640
Maybe there's water.

629
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:27,040
Stay behind me.

630
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:32,200
"No Trespassers"

631
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:34,160
This is weird.

632
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,120
Who are you?

633
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,920
Travelers, thats all.
Don't mean any harm.

634
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:20,240
No trespassing. Didn't
you read the sign?

635
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:22,680
We're very sorry,
I didn't see it.

636
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:25,040
- What's your business?
- We were just...

637
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:27,120
No business.

638
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:29,240
We're very sorry,
and if you let us,

639
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:31,120
we'll be on our way.

640
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:33,040
George, look at them.

641
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:35,280
One of them is
just a girl.

642
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:38,600
Old story. Heard it a
hundred times before.

643
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:40,520
We get so few
visitors these days,

644
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:43,200
George is suspicious
of everybody.

645
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,040
I'm Martha.

646
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:47,360
Would you care
for some tea?

647
01:14:57,640 --> 01:15:01,320
How about some music?
It's so soothing.

648
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:02,600
George!

649
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:22,440
<i>You can ring my bell,
ring my bell.</i>

650
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:23,720
How do you like it?

651
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:36,560
<i>You can ring my bell,
ring my bell.</i>

652
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:39,320
- Is that good?
- Good, good.

653
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:41,240
Great.

654
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:47,440
It's amazing that you
two have survived

655
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:49,200
out here all by
yourselves.

656
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:52,960
Well, now. George is
something of a handyman.

657
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,360
He did a lot of
work on this place,

658
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:58,040
making it safe.

659
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:00,840
We may be old, but
we're resilliant.

660
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:03,200
We've had more than
a few trying to take

661
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:05,520
this place from us,
haven't we George?

662
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,240
Yes we have.

663
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:09,400
I wanna show you
something, come on.

664
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:12,320
George, no. Not now.

665
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:13,920
Come on!

666
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:19,240
- Are these...?
- Graves? Sure.

667
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:21,480
It'd be uncivilized
not to bury them.

668
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:24,640
Besides, it's good
for the soil.

669
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:26,280
Come on back inside.

670
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:28,520
I might be able to rustle
up some sandwhiches.

671
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:30,680
Well, thank you. Thank
you very much.

672
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:32,560
- We gotta go now.
- They killed these people.

673
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:33,960
They didn't just kill
them. They ate them.

674
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:35,920
- Their hands are shaking.
- Too much human meat.

675
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:37,240
Let's go.

676
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:40,440
I found some meat.
I hope you're hungry.

677
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:41,960
No. No, thank you.

678
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:45,760
- Well, we gotta be going.
- So soon?

679
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:47,240
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

680
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:48,640
Are you sure you
won't stay?

681
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:51,800
I'm sure. Very sure.
Put the gun down.

682
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:54,720
Sorry. Take this. Open
the door for us, please.

683
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:57,840
- Thank you for the tea.
- Thank you so much.

684
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:06,560
Go back inside.

685
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:11,720
George, what's wrong?

686
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:14,200
Whole company of armed
degenerats, thats what,

687
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:16,640
and they led them
straight to us.

688
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,200
I just set out the
good china.

689
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:19,320
Fuck the china.

690
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:20,800
Have you got any
more weapons?

691
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:24,120
Weapons? I'll show
you some weapons.

692
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:32,320
Come on.

693
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:34,680
We know you're
in there.

694
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:39,160
Come on out and nobody
needs to get hurt.

695
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:45,320
I'll make it easy.

696
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:48,280
Send out Solara
with the book.

697
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:49,200
What are we
gonna do?

698
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:51,000
I know what the
fuck I'm doing.

699
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,600
Wait, wait.

700
01:17:57,640 --> 01:17:59,800
They ain't coming out.

701
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:28,760
Shit! Get down!
Everybody down!

702
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:50,280
You know that
voice you heard?

703
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:51,960
Did he say anything
about this?

704
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:54,680
We'll get out alive.
Both of us.

705
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:56,000
What about us?

706
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:58,640
Didn't mention you.

707
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,280
Cease fire!

708
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:11,400
Cease fire.

709
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:25,680
Motherfuckers!

710
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:34,800
<i>Over on the side!
Over on the side!</i>

711
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:39,240
Fucking bastards!

712
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:45,640
Hold your fire!

713
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:48,920
- What are they doing?
- Nothing good.

714
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:04,920
Where is the book?

715
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:13,480
Check his pack.

716
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:33,280
It ain't here.

717
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:39,320
This is your last chance.
You give it up, or

718
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:41,720
I swear I'll bury
you out here.

719
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:56,080
Son-of-a...
Let's try this again.

720
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:02,600
- Carnegie!
- What!?

721
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:16,880
Now. Where's the book?

722
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,640
Give him the book.
Please.

723
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,960
Don't tell him.

724
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:42,640
It's in the house.
Back of the TV.

725
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:47,560
- Go check the TV.
- The what?

726
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:50,240
You gotta be fucking
shitting me. You go!

727
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,320
Go!

728
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,840
Ask and you
shall receive.

729
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:39,000
God is good,
is he not?

730
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:41,520
All the time.

731
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:45,680
Not all the time.

732
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:14,240
No!

733
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:04,480
You see? What
did I tell you?

734
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:12,760
He's just a man.

735
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:19,280
No! Leave him alone!

736
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:29,800
Where's your
protection now?

737
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:32,520
Hmm?

738
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:46,440
Pray for me.

739
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:50,960
Okay?

740
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:57,040
I mean it.

741
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:25,160
Shit.

742
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:27,960
Go back!

743
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:14,120
Come on.
Come on!

744
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:15,640
We've got enough
fuel to make it back,

745
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:17,280
do you want to
go after her?

746
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:20,680
No.

747
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:45,120
- Where are you going?
- I'm going West.

748
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:45,920
Gotta go West.

749
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:50,080
Hey.

750
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:19,160
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

751
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:20,920
This. This is
all my fault.

752
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:22,360
- No, it's not.
- Yeah it is,

753
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:23,400
if I didn't come with
you, none of this

754
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:24,720
would have happened.

755
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:29,160
It's not your fault.

756
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:32,880
Did what I had to do.

757
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:34,560
Didn't think anything
could make you

758
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:35,280
give up that book.

759
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:43,120
You know, for years
I've been carrying and

760
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:45,040
reading it every day.

761
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:50,520
I got so caught up
with keeping it safe

762
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:55,400
I forgot to live by
what I learned from it.

763
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:57,840
Yeah? What's that?

764
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:00,720
Just to...

765
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:06,280
Do for others more than
you do for yourself.

766
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:11,160
It's what I got
from it anyway.

767
01:32:57,920 --> 01:32:59,400
Do you smell that?

768
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:03,920
- What?
- In the air. Salt.

769
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:11,040
We're getting close
to the ocean.

770
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:11,720
That is good.

771
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:14,960
That's it.

772
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:50,200
Get the Engineer!

773
01:36:22,040 --> 01:36:23,840
That's far enough!

774
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:27,040
What's your
business here?

775
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,320
My name is Eli.

776
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:33,640
I have a King James
Bible in my possession.

777
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:36,120
Remain where you are.
Don't attempt to make

778
01:36:36,120 --> 01:36:39,880
any sudden moves, or
you will be fired upon.

779
01:36:56,440 --> 01:37:00,120
Be careful with it.
Thank you.

780
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:08,440
Careful with it.

781
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:19,760
Wait.

782
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:24,600
We've been doing this
for a long time now.

783
01:37:26,120 --> 01:37:29,880
- Feels like a museum.
- It's much more than that.

784
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:33,200
This is where we're
going to start again.

785
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:34,720
We've got a printing
press that will be

786
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:37,120
operational quite soon.

787
01:37:37,120 --> 01:37:38,400
We're going to teach
people about the

788
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:40,640
world they lost.

789
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:43,160
Help them start
to rebuild it.

790
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:45,560
Look. Shakespear.
Britannica.

791
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:47,680
Missing only a
few volumes.

792
01:37:47,680 --> 01:37:50,000
There's a whole series
of beautiful Mozart

793
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,640
and Wagner records. Still
in very pristine condition.

794
01:37:53,640 --> 01:37:57,320
But never a Bible.
Well, not until now.

795
01:37:57,320 --> 01:38:01,000
May I ask what
condition it's in?

796
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:07,080
It's beat up. But it
will do the job.

797
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:09,320
Do you think
I could see it?

798
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:10,600
Yes, you may.

799
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:20,800
- That's it. It's open.
- Good.

800
01:38:55,200 --> 01:38:56,560
Do you have anything
to write on?

801
01:38:56,560 --> 01:39:00,200
Could you get us some
writing paper, please?

802
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:01,480
A lot of it.

803
01:39:03,320 --> 01:39:05,040
A whole lot of it.

804
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:07,680
It can't be.

805
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:17,400
It's impossible!

806
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:20,320
It can't be!

807
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:25,280
Pay close attention.

808
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:30,720
And write down
everything I say.

809
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:35,360
Exactly as I say it.

810
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:45,880
The first book of Moses.
Called Genesis.

811
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:50,440
Chapter one,
verse one:

812
01:39:53,640 --> 01:40:00,760
"In the beginning God
created the heavens

813
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:02,160
and the earth."

814
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:08,160
Verse two:

815
01:40:10,040 --> 01:40:18,760
"And the earth was
without form and void;

816
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:30,760
and darkness was upon
the face of the deep.

817
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:42,000
And the Spirit of God
was hovering

818
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:45,080
over the face
of the waters."

819
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:50,680
Verse three:

820
01:40:53,200 --> 01:41:05,960
"And God said, Let
there be light:

821
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:08,120
and there was light."

822
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:20,880
Where is Solara?

823
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:28,320
Out there.
Her choice.

824
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:33,880
I tried to bring her
back. She refused.

825
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,800
What did you do
when she refused?

826
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:46,480
Read it.

827
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:47,720
What did you do
to my daughter?

828
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:48,680
Read it!

829
01:41:48,680 --> 01:41:51,800
What did you do
to my daughter!?

830
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:21,120
Sorry.

831
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:26,840
It's been so long
I dont remember.

832
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:37,400
- You have to.
- I have to? Really?

833
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:39,840
You have to. Please.

834
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:48,600
- Your leg.
- It doesn't hurt anymore.

835
01:42:49,320 --> 01:42:51,280
I can smell it.

836
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:08,880
You worked so hard
for that book.

837
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:13,560
You sacrificed so
much, so many men.

838
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:16,960
More than you
could spare.

839
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:20,960
Now, all those people
who were too scared

840
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:23,880
to even say your name.
They're downstairs,

841
01:43:23,880 --> 01:43:27,120
tearing up the bar right
now, did you know that?

842
01:43:27,720 --> 01:43:30,840
And there's no one
there to stop them.

843
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:34,400
And you are feverish.

844
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:38,120
I can't imagine what
it must feel like to

845
01:43:38,120 --> 01:43:40,080
have what you want
so close and it might

846
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:42,320
aswell be a million
miles away.

847
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:43,600
Stop it!

848
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:53,960
Are you leaving me?
Claudia?

849
01:43:55,200 --> 01:43:57,200
Claudia!?

850
01:44:00,120 --> 01:44:02,120
Claudia!

851
01:45:50,240 --> 01:45:54,040
Dear Lord. Thank you for
giving me the strength

852
01:45:54,040 --> 01:45:55,840
and the conviction to
complete the task you

853
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:57,360
entrusted to me.

854
01:46:22,280 --> 01:46:25,400
Thank you for guiding
me straight and true,

855
01:46:25,400 --> 01:46:28,320
through the many
obstacles on my path.

856
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:35,960
And for keeping me
resolute when all around

857
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:38,080
seemed lost.

858
01:46:38,440 --> 01:46:40,080
Thank you for your
protection and for your

859
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:42,880
many signs along
the way.

860
01:46:44,160 --> 01:46:46,880
Thank you for any good
that I may have done,

861
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:50,120
I'm so sorry
about the bad.

862
01:46:50,760 --> 01:46:52,040
You don't have to
leave, you know.

863
01:46:52,040 --> 01:46:54,240
You're very welcome
to stay here.

864
01:46:54,240 --> 01:46:56,520
You'll be perfectly safe.

865
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:58,440
Thank you.

866
01:46:58,440 --> 01:47:01,360
But this is something
that I have to do.

867
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:07,800
Where will you go?

868
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:10,200
Home.

869
01:47:16,240 --> 01:47:18,480
Thank you for the
friend I made.

870
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:22,680
Please watch over her,
as you watched over me.

871
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:46,760
Thank you for finally
allowing me to rest.

872
01:47:46,760 --> 01:47:48,880
I'm so very tired.

873
01:47:49,240 --> 01:47:53,200
But I go now to my
rest at peace.

874
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:55,120
Knowing that I've done
right with my time

875
01:47:55,120 --> 01:47:57,200
on this earth.

876
01:47:57,200 --> 01:48:01,920
HOLY BIBLE
NEW KING JAMES VERSION

877
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:11,840
I fought the good fight.
I finished the race.

878
01:48:13,640 --> 01:48:16,480
I kept the faith.
