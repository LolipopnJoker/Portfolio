1
00:00:55,905 --> 00:01:00,076
America first fell in love with
Eddie Thomas and Gwen Harrison...

2
00:01:00,284 --> 00:01:05,248
...in the box-office smash
Autumn with Greg and Peg.

3
00:01:05,456 --> 00:01:08,459
They had the most celebrated marriage
in Hollywood.

4
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,840
Who could forget
how they hit one out of the park...

5
00:01:14,006 --> 00:01:16,217
...in Requiem for an Outfielder?

6
00:01:16,384 --> 00:01:20,054
You can't die, Mike. You can't.

7
00:01:20,555 --> 00:01:22,557
Because I love you.

8
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:29,063
Justice never tasted so sweet...

9
00:01:29,313 --> 00:01:31,149
...as in The Bench.

10
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:36,612
I didn't do it. I'm innocent.
Why won't anyone believe me?

11
00:01:36,821 --> 00:01:39,365
- I object, Your Honour!
- You're out of order!

12
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,200
No, you are out of order sir!

13
00:01:41,284 --> 00:01:44,495
I object to the way
my client has been treated.

14
00:01:44,954 --> 00:01:48,124
I object to the fact that I've let
my professional judgment...

15
00:01:48,332 --> 00:01:51,043
...become clouded by my feelings
for my client.

16
00:01:51,294 --> 00:01:55,131
I object to the way the room seems to spin
whenever she walks into it.

17
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:59,135
I object, Your Honour,
because I love this woman.

18
00:01:59,677 --> 00:02:01,888
Their love opened our eyes...

19
00:02:02,096 --> 00:02:04,724
...in Sasha and the Optometrist.

20
00:02:04,974 --> 00:02:07,268
Read from the top line, Sasha.

21
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:11,731
"I...

22
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:16,694
"... L-O-V-E...

23
00:02:16,861 --> 00:02:19,530
"... Y-O..."

24
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,657
Oh.

25
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:23,201
You.

26
00:02:23,868 --> 00:02:25,453
Dr. Martin!

27
00:02:25,661 --> 00:02:29,248
Eddie Thomas and Gwen Harrison:

28
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,543
America's Sweethearts.

29
00:02:38,883 --> 00:02:41,886
God, they were great. Made my job cake.

30
00:02:42,053 --> 00:02:46,432
I did the press for all their movies, all nine.
Six did over $100 million.

31
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:49,143
They were on top of the world.

32
00:02:49,393 --> 00:02:52,230
Then she blew it
by taking up with that Spaniard.

33
00:02:52,313 --> 00:02:55,108
- Did you cut this yourself?
- No, Chad in marketing-

34
00:02:55,191 --> 00:02:58,861
Always take credit.
That is survival rule number one.

35
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,780
Okay, I did it on my Mac.

36
00:03:00,863 --> 00:03:05,410
Rule number two: Don't take credit
until someone actually says they like what you did.

37
00:03:06,077 --> 00:03:07,328
It's not bad.

38
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:12,667
I hope this isn't too awkward for you.

39
00:03:12,834 --> 00:03:15,461
- I'll never be able to fill your shoes.
- I know.

40
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:21,551
Kingman's in the screening room and he
wants you to look at something right now.

41
00:03:22,593 --> 00:03:26,097
Please remind Mr. Kingman
that he fired me last week.

42
00:03:26,347 --> 00:03:29,934
Then invite him, at his earliest
convenience, to kiss my undercarriage.

43
00:03:30,017 --> 00:03:32,103
I think you'll wanna see this Lee.

44
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:40,069
- Hello, Dave.
- Lee.

45
00:03:40,695 --> 00:03:42,822
- Thank you for coming.
- Why am I here?

46
00:03:42,947 --> 00:03:47,160
I'm just confused. I mean, you did actually fire me
last week, so why am I here?

47
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,871
I brought you to see the new Weidmann film.

48
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:51,080
- Really?
- Yes.

49
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:53,708
Eddie and Gwen's last movie.
You know their movies better than anybody

50
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:56,419
Have you seen it? All of it? How is it?

51
00:03:56,961 --> 00:03:58,421
Could you roll that, please.

52
00:03:59,297 --> 00:04:03,551
I want you to be the first to see
what only I have seen. As a friend.

53
00:04:30,369 --> 00:04:31,746
Something wrong?

54
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,999
- Did the film break?
- No.

55
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:38,836
The film is fine.
I think it's fine, wherever it is.

56
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:43,257
I spent 86 million dollars...

57
00:04:43,382 --> 00:04:45,218
...of the studio's money...

58
00:04:45,343 --> 00:04:46,928
...on 20 seconds...

59
00:04:47,512 --> 00:04:48,763
...of titles.

60
00:04:51,099 --> 00:04:53,184
That's all he sent me. The titles!

61
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,478
And a note.

62
00:04:57,772 --> 00:05:00,691
"Dave, we could also do these in blue."

63
00:05:03,194 --> 00:05:07,782
- We had to make a Hal Weidmann picture!
- He's won three Oscars. He's a genius.

64
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:11,411
There's only been one genius
in this business: SeÃ±or Wences!

65
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:15,415
A little lipstick, some hair and his hand!
He had an career for 85 years!

66
00:05:15,706 --> 00:05:17,333
Do you remember?

67
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:21,045
"S'all right! S'all right!"
Don't talk to me about genius.

68
00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:24,257
- Remember the crazy guy in the woods?
- Ted Kaczynski.

69
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,217
- Who? The guy at Fox?
- The Unabomber.

70
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,011
The Unabomber.
Remember he lived in that little cabin?

71
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:30,179
So?

72
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:34,016
Hal Weidmann bought that cabin
from the government...

73
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,644
...and had it moved onto his property.

74
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:39,564
That is where he edits his movies.

75
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,984
That is his little, twisted...

76
00:05:43,234 --> 00:05:45,445
...sicko office.

77
00:05:45,737 --> 00:05:47,447
It's him. On the phone.

78
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:50,241
- Who?
- Hal.

79
00:05:50,575 --> 00:05:54,078
I'm going to kill him!
That sick, son-of-a-bitch bastard.

80
00:05:54,746 --> 00:05:56,330
Put him on the speaker.

81
00:05:56,414 --> 00:05:57,415
Hi, Hal.

82
00:05:59,917 --> 00:06:01,169
How are you, darling?

83
00:06:01,252 --> 00:06:05,089
I've been thinking about you.
I wanted to send you a basket or something.

84
00:06:05,256 --> 00:06:06,507
How's the movie?

85
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:09,385
- It's finding its way.
- Could it find its way to the studio?

86
00:06:09,552 --> 00:06:12,555
We have a few little things to do with it,
like finish it.

87
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,682
It's finished, Dave.

88
00:06:16,768 --> 00:06:18,603
Great. How is it?

89
00:06:18,686 --> 00:06:21,439
My mother thinks
it's the best thing I've ever done.

90
00:06:21,773 --> 00:06:24,150
- Can I speak with her, Hal?
- No, Dave.

91
00:06:24,442 --> 00:06:27,153
- Can we send someone to pick it up?
- No, Dave.

92
00:06:27,236 --> 00:06:29,447
You haven't said anything about the titles.

93
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:31,991
I love them. I have no notes.

94
00:06:32,283 --> 00:06:33,659
When's the press junket?

95
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:36,454
Weekend of the 21st. Why?

96
00:06:36,954 --> 00:06:38,956
'cos I want the press to be first to see it.

97
00:06:39,624 --> 00:06:42,752
I'll bring it to the junket.
We'll all experience it together.

98
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:47,632
Hal, no. I'm the head of the studio.
I don't experience things with the press.

99
00:06:47,965 --> 00:06:49,133
I'm hanging up now.

100
00:06:49,467 --> 00:06:51,677
Wait! Give me that. Hello?

101
00:06:52,136 --> 00:06:53,137
No, no.

102
00:06:53,971 --> 00:06:55,139
God...

103
00:06:55,473 --> 00:06:56,641
...damn it!

104
00:07:04,649 --> 00:07:06,776
He won't let us see it before the press!

105
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:09,320
- At the junket?
- Yes, at the junket!

106
00:07:12,824 --> 00:07:14,492
- No, no.
- Lee.

107
00:07:15,284 --> 00:07:17,036
You've got to do this junket.

108
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,706
You want me to set up a junket in 2 weeks,
and you're not sure if you have the film.

109
00:07:20,832 --> 00:07:21,833
- Yes.
- No!

110
00:07:25,962 --> 00:07:27,130
Lee!

111
00:07:30,508 --> 00:07:32,176
Don't make me beg.

112
00:07:32,635 --> 00:07:34,679
- You already are.
- Lee, please.

113
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:37,014
Please, come on. Lee?

114
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:40,726
- Danny can handle it.
- No, Lee.

115
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:44,397
Danny cannot handle it.
It's his first junket.

116
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:48,401
I need the master. When working
with the press, you're a legend.

117
00:07:48,693 --> 00:07:50,695
I prefer to remain a living legend.

118
00:07:50,778 --> 00:07:53,406
If you won't do it for me,
do it for my father.

119
00:07:53,489 --> 00:07:56,576
You worked together a long time.
You had a real bond.

120
00:07:56,784 --> 00:07:58,494
Your father was a psychotic.

121
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:01,873
- You spoke at his funeral.
- I loved him. You, I can't stand.

122
00:08:01,956 --> 00:08:04,250
Do this for me. Please.

123
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,879
The studio will go under.
I haven't had a hit in almost two years!

124
00:08:07,962 --> 00:08:12,341
I have the last Eddie and Gwen movie ever made
and I can't get my hands on it!

125
00:08:19,682 --> 00:08:22,560
Tell me what you want.
I'll tell you what I want.

126
00:08:22,643 --> 00:08:24,145
I want only one thing.

127
00:08:24,228 --> 00:08:27,732
If people think Eddie and Gwen
are back together, they'll see the movie.

128
00:08:27,857 --> 00:08:30,067
- Make that happen.
- That'll be easy.

129
00:08:30,193 --> 00:08:32,570
Just make it look like it could happen.

130
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:36,032
She has a restraining order against him,
and he flipped out.

131
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:38,242
He's living in some nut hut
in the mountains.

132
00:08:38,326 --> 00:08:43,122
I don't care! I need Eddie and Gwen
back together again, smiling and happy!

133
00:08:44,499 --> 00:08:46,876
- We can sell the shit out of it.
- And the Spaniard?

134
00:08:47,001 --> 00:08:50,505
Unless I get a script called
I Schtupped Castro, I don't know.

135
00:08:52,048 --> 00:08:53,633
So, what do you want?

136
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,384
I want the golf cart.

137
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:58,137
- No, it was a gift from Arnold.
- I'm kidding.

138
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,642
- I can have anything?
- Yeah. Within reason.

139
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,770
I want my job back.

140
00:09:05,853 --> 00:09:09,524
- Don't do this to me-
- Have a great junket. Tell me how it went.

141
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:12,193
All right. Yes.

142
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:17,824
If you get Eddie and Gwen back together,
you can have your job back.

143
00:09:18,783 --> 00:09:21,160
- Where are we booked?
- Four Seasons, Beverly Hills.

144
00:09:21,244 --> 00:09:24,288
Cancel. We need to get these people
in the middle of nowhere.

145
00:09:24,372 --> 00:09:26,749
Once they know there's no movie,
they can't escape.

146
00:09:26,874 --> 00:09:29,585
We need a hotel like the one
in The Shining. Isolated.

147
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:33,256
The new Hyatt in Nevada?
It's in the desert, and it's just opening.

148
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:36,759
Book it. We have to keep
the press entertained and on the go.

149
00:09:36,884 --> 00:09:40,721
The best junkets are when the press thinks
it's not about the movie, but them.

150
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:44,767
Program the shit out of them:
Cocktail parties, hayrides, circle jerks.

151
00:09:44,892 --> 00:09:48,729
Keep them from remembering they
haven't seen the movie they're to review.

152
00:09:48,813 --> 00:09:49,897
What about gifts?

153
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:53,693
The movie's about a cop
who travels through time, so I did a gun.

154
00:09:54,235 --> 00:09:57,238
- You're giving press members a gun?
- It's not real.

155
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,741
We'll do a really nice bag.
Call the bag man.

156
00:09:59,824 --> 00:10:02,660
Diamond earrings for the ladies,
money clips for the men.

157
00:10:02,744 --> 00:10:04,829
Chocolate truffles, the best perfume.

158
00:10:04,912 --> 00:10:07,665
I don't want this to be awkward for you...

159
00:10:07,749 --> 00:10:09,667
...but I've got some work to do.

160
00:10:10,084 --> 00:10:14,088
- How will you get Eddie and Gwen there?
- Don't worry. I know somebody.

161
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:18,634
I love you. I'd do anything for you.
You're just asking an awful lot.

162
00:10:18,843 --> 00:10:21,763
A junket with Eddie
isn't high on Gwen's list of priorities.

163
00:10:21,846 --> 00:10:23,598
No lilies. Take them out.

164
00:10:23,765 --> 00:10:25,892
Yes. I understand.

165
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,187
Yes. Excuse me, hold on.
Could you please put that out?

166
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:32,940
- This is perfect for Gwen.
- I can't accept unsolicited material.

167
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:37,612
Just warning you it'll be a bit of a fight.
I'll do what I can.

168
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:39,155
God help us.

169
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:43,284
Commercial break. When we come back,
you know the scenario.

170
00:10:43,367 --> 00:10:44,744
I've been here before Larry.

171
00:10:44,827 --> 00:10:47,580
When the tape rolls,
look right at that camera.

172
00:10:47,663 --> 00:10:49,415
Talk right to the caller.

173
00:10:49,499 --> 00:10:52,043
- Right down the tube.
- Okay, five seconds.

174
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:57,090
Let's go to phone calls on Larry King Live.

175
00:10:57,215 --> 00:10:59,967
White Plains, you're on the air
with Gwen Harrison.

176
00:11:00,051 --> 00:11:01,052
Hi, Larry.

177
00:11:01,135 --> 00:11:05,139
Gwen, hi. I used to be a big fan...

178
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:09,811
...but I'm sorry, I can't get over what
happened with you and Eddie. I'm so sick.

179
00:11:09,894 --> 00:11:12,271
I can't sleep at night. How can you?

180
00:11:12,355 --> 00:11:13,731
Well...

181
00:11:13,981 --> 00:11:17,902
You sleep next to a very handsome
young Spanish gentleman, don't you?

182
00:11:19,904 --> 00:11:23,574
Let's go to our next call.
Rock Island, Illinois. Hello.

183
00:11:24,075 --> 00:11:26,285
Hi Larry. Gwen, I saw your latest movie.

184
00:11:26,828 --> 00:11:27,912
Thank you.

185
00:11:27,995 --> 00:11:32,208
I couldn't sit through it.
I can't watch you without Eddie, it's not the same.

186
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:36,212
This has to be hard to hear. Your last
two movies, ones without Eddie...

187
00:11:36,337 --> 00:11:38,798
...crashed and burned at the box office.

188
00:11:39,257 --> 00:11:43,302
They were very big in Europe
and huge in Japan, actually.

189
00:11:43,386 --> 00:11:46,514
It's got to be tough.
Two unsuccessful movies in a row.

190
00:11:46,597 --> 00:11:49,350
Lots of intrigue, lots of whispers,
lots of talk.

191
00:11:49,434 --> 00:11:51,978
What happens if this one tanks?

192
00:11:53,271 --> 00:11:57,191
I hate Larry King.
Why did I do his stupid show?

193
00:11:57,275 --> 00:11:59,485
- Just breathe.
- I don't want to breathe.

194
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:02,071
"Your last two movies
crashed and burned."

195
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:06,367
I wanted to choke him to death
with those stupid suspenders.

196
00:12:07,034 --> 00:12:09,120
- Everyone hates me.
- No one hates you.

197
00:12:09,203 --> 00:12:13,207
The lighting was great.
You looked great. Everybody said so.

198
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,752
- Who?
- You looked great.

199
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,504
Thanks. As if she really knows.

200
00:12:18,713 --> 00:12:21,549
Have a sip of water.
It'll make you feel better.

201
00:12:21,716 --> 00:12:25,219
Is this the one with the electrolytes?
I only like that water.

202
00:12:27,138 --> 00:12:30,099
- Larry said you were amazing.
- Thank you.

203
00:12:30,308 --> 00:12:32,059
I love Larry.

204
00:12:32,226 --> 00:12:34,687
Let's love him down to the dressing room.

205
00:12:41,235 --> 00:12:42,945
- Black or white?
- White.

206
00:12:43,654 --> 00:12:47,241
And those glasses.
Who wears frames that big anymore?

207
00:12:47,492 --> 00:12:49,368
He looks like a bug.

208
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,997
I just want this week to be over.

209
00:12:53,498 --> 00:12:57,668
Why can't the world accept the fact
I don't want to be with Eddie anymore?

210
00:12:57,752 --> 00:13:00,630
I just want to scream at people,
"Get a life!"

211
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:05,301
- I want this week to be over. Is it?
- Almost. Push.

212
00:13:08,596 --> 00:13:09,764
I'm sorry.

213
00:13:12,016 --> 00:13:14,769
I smell smoke. Is somebody smoking?

214
00:13:16,187 --> 00:13:18,564
- I don't know.
- It's probably Larry.

215
00:13:18,856 --> 00:13:22,777
- How many heart attacks has he had?
- Six? Maybe seven?

216
00:13:22,944 --> 00:13:26,197
Can we just go?
I don't want to be here anymore.

217
00:13:27,365 --> 00:13:29,450
- Those are beautiful.
- Okay.

218
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,828
I got a call from Lee today.

219
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:34,872
- Who's Lee?
- The studio's publicist. You remember.

220
00:13:34,956 --> 00:13:36,749
- I do?
- Remember were you were doing Letterman?

221
00:13:36,874 --> 00:13:40,461
You got upset when they bumped your
show off the air due to the Gulf War.

222
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:43,047
He was there.
He got you that English toffee.

223
00:13:43,131 --> 00:13:45,425
I remember the English toffee. Great toffee.

224
00:13:45,633 --> 00:13:50,596
We'll get you some when you meet
with him to talk about the junket.

225
00:13:50,888 --> 00:13:55,309
- Oh, God. Do I have to?
- Meet with him? Yes, you have to.

226
00:13:55,476 --> 00:13:59,564
It's not fair. All this pressure on me
and none whatsoever on Eddie.

227
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:01,441
He's probably having the time of his life.

228
00:14:02,525 --> 00:14:05,653
This letter is a very important part
of the healing process.

229
00:14:05,737 --> 00:14:09,157
Writing to your mother,
you have the opportunity to thank her...

230
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:13,286
...or forgive her or ask her why she did
the things she did.

231
00:14:13,745 --> 00:14:15,163
Don't mail the letter.

232
00:14:15,246 --> 00:14:18,166
The simple act of putting it on paper
frees you...

233
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,209
...allows you to let go.

234
00:14:20,418 --> 00:14:23,337
Now, what did you say to your mother?

235
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,633
"Dear Mom:

236
00:14:27,842 --> 00:14:29,093
"Fuck you."

237
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:32,805
Okay. We'll try the letter some other time.

238
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,517
Are you comfortable
speaking about Gwen?

239
00:14:37,393 --> 00:14:39,687
- Do you think I should?
- There is no "should."

240
00:14:39,771 --> 00:14:42,231
- Do you think I can?
- What is "can"?

241
00:14:44,108 --> 00:14:45,276
All right.

242
00:14:49,447 --> 00:14:50,990
There was this place in Chinatown.

243
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:54,535
Tiny little place.

244
00:14:55,787 --> 00:14:57,997
We'd go there and they wouldn't bother us.

245
00:14:58,206 --> 00:15:02,543
We'd order wonton soup and crumpled
duck and sit there for hours, talking.

246
00:15:03,586 --> 00:15:05,088
She took him there.

247
00:15:07,423 --> 00:15:09,550
She took him to our crumpled duck.

248
00:15:15,098 --> 00:15:19,393
I followed them and I saw him
pouring the soup and smiling...

249
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,078
It was a total accident.

250
00:15:37,245 --> 00:15:42,625
Next thing, she told the press I tried to kill
her. That's crazy. She loves to overreact.

251
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,132
We have a saying, Edward.

252
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:52,510
"Mecka lecka halava beem sala beem."

253
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,595
What is that? Bean salad?

254
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,683
What does that mean?

255
00:15:59,434 --> 00:16:02,061
I don't know what it means. It's very old.

256
00:16:07,775 --> 00:16:10,528
I feel like I'm making progress.
I feel more secure.

257
00:16:10,611 --> 00:16:12,822
A lot more secure.
Do I seem more secure?

258
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:17,577
You look great. Whatever the doctors
are doing, it's working.

259
00:16:17,785 --> 00:16:20,329
You got colour in your face. I'm in love.

260
00:16:20,538 --> 00:16:23,291
They say two weeks here
changes your entire life.

261
00:16:23,374 --> 00:16:25,918
- When are two weeks up?
- Six and a half months ago.

262
00:16:26,043 --> 00:16:28,171
I feel I'm getting close to something.

263
00:16:28,296 --> 00:16:30,590
I can see that.

264
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:33,718
Did you watch Larry King last night?

265
00:16:33,801 --> 00:16:36,471
I was in the isolation tank. No TV in there.

266
00:16:36,637 --> 00:16:39,932
The reason I bring it up is Gwen was on.

267
00:16:42,351 --> 00:16:43,936
She took kind of a beating.

268
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,688
She did, did she?

269
00:16:46,481 --> 00:16:49,317
You, young lady,
are nobody without Eddie!

270
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:51,319
Nobody likes you!

271
00:16:51,527 --> 00:16:54,947
Never, never go anywhere without Eddie.
You're nothing.

272
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:56,657
You're nothing!

273
00:16:56,824 --> 00:16:59,118
Get her out of here. Now! Nothing!

274
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:00,787
I'm so sorry, Larry.

275
00:17:02,413 --> 00:17:04,540
I guess she got what she deserved.

276
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,127
Why are you doing here? This isn't you.

277
00:17:08,336 --> 00:17:11,089
Kiss Gandhi goodbye
and get ready for the junket.

278
00:17:11,172 --> 00:17:13,549
I won't go! I'm not ready.

279
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,927
The studio and the movie need you.

280
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:19,347
I don't care about the studio or the movie.
How is it? Is it good?

281
00:17:19,597 --> 00:17:23,101
I've only seen a bit in the beginning.
It's fantastic.

282
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:25,770
Hold it up to your ear,
you'll scream "Oscar."

283
00:17:25,895 --> 00:17:27,772
- I'm telling you.
- No, I'm not going.

284
00:17:27,855 --> 00:17:29,273
Gwen will be there.

285
00:17:30,066 --> 00:17:31,609
You want to see her?

286
00:17:31,692 --> 00:17:34,695
- No. It's too soon.
- It's a year and a half.

287
00:17:34,904 --> 00:17:38,825
Confront her. Get it over with.
She fell in love with another guy.

288
00:17:39,575 --> 00:17:40,743
It happens.

289
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:45,039
Never to me, but if it did, I wouldn't
spend my life hiding like some pussy!

290
00:17:45,248 --> 00:17:48,251
I'm not a pussy.
I'm in the middle of my treatment.

291
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:52,171
This is serious stuff.
My wellness guide won't let me just go.

292
00:17:53,714 --> 00:17:55,133
- You can go.
- Are you sure?

293
00:17:55,216 --> 00:17:59,470
Two nights ago you said I was the flower that fell into the
stream, but a branch is blocking my way.

294
00:17:59,554 --> 00:18:00,471
Do you take that back?

295
00:18:00,555 --> 00:18:04,058
You read too much into what I say.
Don't listen to my words, listen to your own heart.

296
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:08,479
- I'm the flower. I don't want to go.
- You're a funny man. We'll miss you here.

297
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:11,733
- Don't forget to be grateful.
- I'm grateful.

298
00:18:11,941 --> 00:18:15,528
I'm grateful for the sun,
for the stars in the sky.

299
00:18:15,778 --> 00:18:18,239
I'd be grateful if we could get going.

300
00:18:20,283 --> 00:18:23,035
- Why don't you wait in the car?
- Okay.

301
00:18:25,872 --> 00:18:27,248
I am the flower.

302
00:18:29,459 --> 00:18:31,085
I'm the flower.

303
00:18:31,294 --> 00:18:34,046
- He kills me with his humour.
- Does he?

304
00:18:35,423 --> 00:18:38,509
Listen, chief, I want to thank you
for all your help.

305
00:18:38,593 --> 00:18:41,053
- You'll get the car within 10 days.
- Convertible.

306
00:18:41,137 --> 00:18:44,724
Convertible, leather interior, fully loaded.
You'll enjoy it.

307
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:47,685
He'll get through this okay, right?

308
00:18:50,605 --> 00:18:52,106
Life is a cookie.

309
00:18:54,817 --> 00:18:56,611
I'll take that as a "yes."

310
00:18:57,028 --> 00:18:58,988
Okay. All right.

311
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:00,490
Come on, Eddie!

312
00:19:02,283 --> 00:19:03,659
All right, buddy.

313
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:06,370
Ready to go? Here we go.

314
00:19:09,832 --> 00:19:12,960
- Does Gwen know I'm going to the junket?
- It was her idea.

315
00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:15,254
Absolutely. She's really excited.

316
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,051
Not in a million years.
If that demented pig is there, no way.

317
00:19:20,468 --> 00:19:24,138
- Eddie was just temporarily insane.
- Don't stick up for him.

318
00:19:24,514 --> 00:19:26,432
- Kiki, look at you.
- Hi, Lee.

319
00:19:27,225 --> 00:19:29,018
- How are you?
- Good.

320
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:30,895
- You look fabulous.
- Thank you.

321
00:19:30,978 --> 00:19:33,106
What did you do? Is it your hair?

322
00:19:33,314 --> 00:19:35,358
It's my hair, and a little sun.

323
00:19:35,858 --> 00:19:37,485
She lost 60 pounds.

324
00:19:39,737 --> 00:19:41,823
And I lost a little weight.

325
00:19:42,031 --> 00:19:45,034
I see that. You look terrific.

326
00:19:45,201 --> 00:19:46,619
Sixty pounds.

327
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:49,747
- That's a Backstreet Boy.
- Right.

328
00:19:49,872 --> 00:19:51,749
Are you here to talk to me?

329
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:55,253
Of course. I'm sorry. Eddie is not demented.

330
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:58,506
It was a one-time incident,
a forgive-and-forget thing.

331
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:02,760
He tried to kill me Lee.
Am I the only person who remembers that?

332
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:06,180
Attempted murder
doesn't get people's attention anymore?

333
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:12,437
He was just so in love with you
that he flipped out.

334
00:20:12,728 --> 00:20:15,565
You know you have this powerful effect
on people.

335
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:18,443
That's true.
Are you sticking up for him again?

336
00:20:19,902 --> 00:20:21,738
- Whose side am I on?
- Mine.

337
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:26,492
Your dog just swallowed
your window washer.

338
00:20:26,701 --> 00:20:27,702
Puppy.

339
00:20:28,244 --> 00:20:31,122
Your puppy, it's a raptor.

340
00:20:31,539 --> 00:20:33,458
Time for Prozac. Excuse me.

341
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:35,793
- She's on Prozac?
- If only. The dog.

342
00:20:35,877 --> 00:20:38,880
Oh, the dog. That's not a bad thing.

343
00:20:38,963 --> 00:20:39,714
- Hey, baby.
- Hi, honey.

344
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:43,134
Here comes your sweaty big man.

345
00:20:43,593 --> 00:20:45,720
- You're sweaty.
- Who is this?

346
00:20:45,928 --> 00:20:49,098
Hi, I'm Lee Phillips,
press agent for Time Over Time.

347
00:20:49,265 --> 00:20:53,352
- I'm not here to sweep her off her feet.
- No, no. You're too old.

348
00:20:54,729 --> 00:20:56,439
Hector, honey.

349
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:58,357
Be good.

350
00:20:58,566 --> 00:21:00,276
I'm sorry. He's Spanish.

351
00:21:00,651 --> 00:21:03,029
No problem. I was Spanish once myself.

352
00:21:03,112 --> 00:21:04,906
Oh, I need kisses.

353
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:11,245
Oh, honey.

354
00:21:12,288 --> 00:21:13,998
Oh, there you go.

355
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,750
Oh, yes.

356
00:21:18,461 --> 00:21:20,588
For why is he here now?

357
00:21:20,838 --> 00:21:23,549
He wants me to go to the junket
for the movie.

358
00:21:24,509 --> 00:21:26,469
We could do that. When is it?

359
00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:29,806
Actually, we won't take up
any of your valuable time.

360
00:21:30,014 --> 00:21:33,351
- I'm not invited to the junket?
- I'm sorry, it's the studio's decision.

361
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:36,979
What do I care what the studio thinks?
I don't give a shit.

362
00:21:37,563 --> 00:21:40,733
I go where Gwen goes.
I'm with Gwen now. We're a couple.

363
00:21:40,817 --> 00:21:43,194
We'll go to the junket together. Okay?

364
00:21:44,404 --> 00:21:45,947
Studio.

365
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:48,825
You're so beautiful.

366
00:21:49,242 --> 00:21:50,701
I love you so much.

367
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:54,414
I want to marry you and make something
with both of our skins.

368
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,250
We're not going Hector. Eddie will be there.

369
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:59,252
We won't go to the junket because of him?

370
00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:01,796
Listen to me. We're going to go...

371
00:22:01,879 --> 00:22:03,798
...and I'll personally protect you...

372
00:22:03,881 --> 00:22:08,344
...in case that psychotic asshole bastard
tries to kill you again.

373
00:22:08,511 --> 00:22:12,432
- We're not going.
- Don't argue with me. We're gonna go.

374
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,769
Everybody wants me to go to this stupid
junket, but nobody cares what I want!

375
00:22:16,853 --> 00:22:18,980
- That's not true.
- Nobody cares!

376
00:22:19,272 --> 00:22:22,692
Don't you know the stress I'm under?
Everybody hates me.

377
00:22:22,859 --> 00:22:26,279
Everyone wants a piece of me.
My therapist's out of the country.

378
00:22:26,362 --> 00:22:29,198
I wasn't nominated
for a Golden Globe this year!

379
00:22:29,449 --> 00:22:31,534
Leave me alone.

380
00:22:33,286 --> 00:22:34,370
Bastards.

381
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,832
Are you pleased with yourself?

382
00:22:38,332 --> 00:22:42,712
I can't even enjoy my shower now,
Mr. Publicist piece of shit.

383
00:22:43,463 --> 00:22:45,590
Gwen is totally nuts.

384
00:22:48,009 --> 00:22:49,635
Cleared the room. Well done.

385
00:22:49,719 --> 00:22:53,639
Talk to your sister. You're the only one
she'll pretend to listen to.

386
00:22:55,224 --> 00:22:56,476
Where is she?

387
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:57,810
Grazing.

388
00:23:14,702 --> 00:23:15,536
Hi.

389
00:23:18,915 --> 00:23:20,625
Nazi bastard.

390
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,001
I was just kidding.

391
00:23:31,886 --> 00:23:33,888
You need to go to this junket.

392
00:23:35,264 --> 00:23:36,891
- Why not?
- I'm afraid.

393
00:23:36,974 --> 00:23:38,059
Of?

394
00:23:38,142 --> 00:23:41,562
That I'll see Eddie
and he'll be this pathetic mess.

395
00:23:42,063 --> 00:23:45,983
I'll feel guilty. I'm tired of feeling guilty,
I really am.

396
00:23:46,442 --> 00:23:47,443
I know.

397
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:51,948
I'm always thinking about other people.

398
00:23:52,281 --> 00:23:53,533
I know you are.

399
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:57,537
It's awful being the person
who cares about other people's feelings.

400
00:23:57,745 --> 00:24:02,083
If they see Eddie down and depressed,
they'll pity him and blame me.

401
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,211
What you're really worried about is you.

402
00:24:05,294 --> 00:24:08,589
Of course. Does everyone hate me, Kiki?

403
00:24:11,342 --> 00:24:13,052
No one hates you.

404
00:24:13,261 --> 00:24:14,429
Yes, they do.

405
00:24:14,554 --> 00:24:18,057
I was in a store the other day.
You know that great store on Melrose?

406
00:24:18,141 --> 00:24:22,603
There was a baby in a stroller
looking up at me and he was judging me.

407
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:26,315
The whole world is judging me
for what I did to Eddie.

408
00:24:28,693 --> 00:24:31,904
Look, I'll admit...

409
00:24:32,113 --> 00:24:35,867
...the Miss Adorable image
has been called into question recently.

410
00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:38,453
That's one more reason to go to the junket.

411
00:24:38,578 --> 00:24:42,582
Smile nice with Eddie for the weekend,
win back some audience goodwill.

412
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:45,168
- You think it would help?
- Yes I do.

413
00:24:46,127 --> 00:24:49,255
I could give Eddie the divorce papers.
That's a plus.

414
00:24:50,423 --> 00:24:52,133
Sure you're ready to do that?

415
00:24:52,216 --> 00:24:55,970
I'm sure. Why are you
still questioning me about this?

416
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,680
Because it's Eddie.

417
00:24:57,764 --> 00:25:02,560
He'd sing Yellow Submarine at the top
of his lungs just to make you laugh.

418
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:05,980
Eddie, who'd save the mango
in his fruit salad for you.

419
00:25:06,189 --> 00:25:09,400
Exactly. Eddie.
You're just a romantic, Kiki.

420
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:11,819
You know nothing about married life.

421
00:25:13,905 --> 00:25:15,573
You got me there.

422
00:25:22,163 --> 00:25:24,373
I won't be able to get through this
on my own.

423
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:26,834
Can you help me?

424
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:28,586
I'll help you.

425
00:25:36,177 --> 00:25:37,720
These are new pants.

426
00:25:39,055 --> 00:25:40,890
Good dog. Get the paper.

427
00:25:41,099 --> 00:25:42,183
Come on.

428
00:25:42,975 --> 00:25:44,393
Come on. Please.

429
00:25:44,727 --> 00:25:45,728
Come on.

430
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:49,941
- Help.
- Don't let me interrupt.

431
00:25:50,191 --> 00:25:51,567
What happened?

432
00:25:51,818 --> 00:25:55,738
I'm going to go pack her things
because we're going to a junket.

433
00:25:55,988 --> 00:25:59,325
Really? Great! You're a great sister.

434
00:25:59,534 --> 00:26:01,160
I'm a great assistant.

435
00:26:02,829 --> 00:26:04,247
To the left.

436
00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:08,186
These are herbal medications.

437
00:27:08,686 --> 00:27:12,440
You probably read in People,
I was on Zoloft, but this is holistic.

438
00:27:12,565 --> 00:27:15,568
- Sure got a lot of them.
- Just watch the road, please.

439
00:27:15,651 --> 00:27:19,072
Bobby? He wants you to pull over.

440
00:27:19,447 --> 00:27:21,157
This is Kishtonga root.

441
00:27:22,158 --> 00:27:24,911
- Why are we stopping?
- I'm doing what I'm told.

442
00:27:27,997 --> 00:27:29,248
So, how you doing?

443
00:27:29,332 --> 00:27:32,126
- Fine. What have you heard?
- I got to hand it to you.

444
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:35,963
If my lady left me for another guy,
I'd have a gun down my throat.

445
00:27:36,172 --> 00:27:37,632
I'd get drunk off my ass.

446
00:27:37,715 --> 00:27:40,968
I'd lay on the tracks and wait for a train
to finish me off.

447
00:27:41,052 --> 00:27:43,262
Could we please not talk about that?

448
00:27:44,889 --> 00:27:46,390
You know something?

449
00:27:46,849 --> 00:27:48,684
People say I look like you.

450
00:27:49,227 --> 00:27:52,480
It's not that I look like you.
But it's like I project you.

451
00:27:52,563 --> 00:27:55,858
Like I project the essence of you,
like a you-ness.

452
00:27:56,067 --> 00:27:58,986
- Can you put that partition up?
- Yes, sir, Mr. Thomas.

453
00:28:03,991 --> 00:28:05,868
How you doing, pal? How's it going?

454
00:28:06,035 --> 00:28:09,455
Great. I was just getting a little pep talk
from my driver.

455
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:14,293
I'm orchestrating the hotel arrival.
Should you pull up first, or Gwen first?

456
00:28:14,502 --> 00:28:19,549
- Where did you come from, man?
- Here. I'm riding with Gwen.

457
00:28:20,675 --> 00:28:22,260
Gwen's back there?

458
00:28:22,552 --> 00:28:25,388
Yes. So do you want
to arrive first or second?

459
00:28:26,931 --> 00:28:29,308
- Second.
- Be right back.

460
00:28:37,024 --> 00:28:38,276
He wants to go second.

461
00:28:38,401 --> 00:28:40,695
- Let him go second.
- He can go second.

462
00:28:40,945 --> 00:28:41,863
Great.

463
00:28:41,988 --> 00:28:43,948
- Wait a minute. He should go first.
- Why?

464
00:28:44,031 --> 00:28:48,161
I don't want to look like his opening act.
I want to go second.

465
00:28:48,536 --> 00:28:49,996
She wants to go second.

466
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:51,456
Second it is.

467
00:28:56,711 --> 00:29:00,465
- She wants to go second.
- Fine. Let her go second. I don't care.

468
00:29:00,965 --> 00:29:04,469
Let her come behind me.
She'll see the knife she stuck in my back.

469
00:29:04,594 --> 00:29:05,762
Thank you.

470
00:29:08,556 --> 00:29:10,099
Second? We're all set.

471
00:29:10,183 --> 00:29:11,809
- Great.
- Who cares?

472
00:29:12,018 --> 00:29:15,772
- She doesn't care.
- Yes, I do. I'm going first.

473
00:29:23,613 --> 00:29:26,074
I don't care! Why is this an issue?

474
00:29:26,324 --> 00:29:29,452
- I'm just trying-
- I don't care! Let's just go to the hotel!

475
00:29:29,535 --> 00:29:31,162
- You're second.
- I don't care!

476
00:29:31,245 --> 00:29:33,623
- I don't care!
- All right.

477
00:29:33,706 --> 00:29:35,833
- I don't care!
- You're going second.

478
00:29:37,376 --> 00:29:39,170
You're going second.

479
00:29:39,504 --> 00:29:41,631
- I don't care.
- Okay, thank you.

480
00:29:46,302 --> 00:29:47,470
That was easy.

481
00:29:49,013 --> 00:29:52,433
- I don't know why we have to go second.
- Just drive the car!

482
00:30:02,402 --> 00:30:06,155
I'm grateful for the sun.
I'm grateful for the moon.

483
00:30:06,406 --> 00:30:08,533
I'm grateful for the cool...

484
00:30:09,325 --> 00:30:10,952
...cool night breeze.

485
00:30:21,796 --> 00:30:24,715
This is certainly a happy night
for Eddie and Gwen fans.

486
00:30:24,924 --> 00:30:28,678
A year ago, America's Sweethearts
went bust in dramatic fashion.

487
00:30:29,846 --> 00:30:34,016
Here they come now. Hi, Gwen.
You look wonderful tonight.

488
00:30:34,183 --> 00:30:35,601
Can I get a shot?

489
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:37,687
That's it.

490
00:30:51,909 --> 00:30:53,494
Who's a better lover?

491
00:30:55,371 --> 00:30:57,039
Okay, right this way.

492
00:31:00,418 --> 00:31:02,128
Okay, Eddie, here we go.

493
00:31:02,295 --> 00:31:04,046
- Eddie, you look great.
- Thank you.

494
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,132
What's it like working with Gwen?

495
00:31:06,215 --> 00:31:07,633
I can't remember.

496
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,403
Eddie that was so good. That had to feel good.

497
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:31,741
It was good we went second. Everybody
loved you. Didn't that feel good?

498
00:31:31,991 --> 00:31:35,578
- What is all this stuff?
- Serenity tea from the Wellness Centre.

499
00:31:36,162 --> 00:31:40,249
I don't know what's in it,
but it gets me really calm, really focused.

500
00:31:44,212 --> 00:31:46,339
I can't do this.

501
00:31:47,757 --> 00:31:49,425
I told you this was a mistake.

502
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:53,262
She's very close, isn't she?
She's in the next room. I can feel her.

503
00:31:53,429 --> 00:31:56,265
No, she's in a cottage
on the back of the property.

504
00:31:56,349 --> 00:31:58,267
I sensed that. She's real close.

505
00:31:58,351 --> 00:32:01,270
She's not. The cottages are way back
on the property.

506
00:32:01,354 --> 00:32:04,273
It's just so shocking.
You're with somebody and...

507
00:32:04,357 --> 00:32:07,735
...you think you'll spend the rest
of your life with that person...

508
00:32:07,819 --> 00:32:09,946
She gets a cottage, I get a shitty little suite?

509
00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:11,697
- She has an entourage.
- And me?

510
00:32:11,781 --> 00:32:13,032
You have an entourage?

511
00:32:13,157 --> 00:32:15,535
I'm a paranoid schizophrenic.
I'm my own entourage.

512
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,828
I'll move you.

513
00:32:16,953 --> 00:32:21,749
No, it's not important. I'm grateful.
I'm grateful for this suite.

514
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:25,336
Greatful for the minibar.
The cottages are probably small anyway.

515
00:32:25,503 --> 00:32:27,213
No, actually, they're...

516
00:32:27,505 --> 00:32:28,589
...tiny.

517
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:30,633
- Small?
- It's ridiculous.

518
00:32:30,842 --> 00:32:32,969
- Good.
- Should I get some room service?

519
00:32:33,052 --> 00:32:37,640
I'll take some herbs, numb out,
have a shower and go to bed by myself.

520
00:32:37,849 --> 00:32:40,059
- You've been fabulous today.
- What did I do?

521
00:32:40,184 --> 00:32:44,230
Showed up. That's enough for me.
Get some rest, I don't want you puffy.

522
00:33:37,033 --> 00:33:39,410
Oh, no.

523
00:33:46,584 --> 00:33:48,086
Jesus.

524
00:33:59,472 --> 00:34:01,390
- Hey, Steve.
- What?

525
00:34:01,557 --> 00:34:04,394
A guy's whacking it
down near cottage number four.

526
00:34:08,231 --> 00:34:10,274
Oh, that's...

527
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:14,570
That's disgusting.
I do not want to deal with this now.

528
00:34:14,821 --> 00:34:18,574
Every time I get this shift,
there's always some sicko like this.

529
00:34:18,741 --> 00:34:21,285
I can't catch a break around here.

530
00:34:25,081 --> 00:34:27,917
Sir, I'm sure things are different in Los Angeles...

531
00:34:28,126 --> 00:34:31,504
...but here in Nevada, masturbating in public
is a punishable offence.

532
00:34:31,587 --> 00:34:34,757
- Excuse me. I've been in Las Vegas-
- I was not-

533
00:34:34,924 --> 00:34:37,051
We saw you on our cameras Mr Thomas.

534
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,262
I was pulling out the pricker.

535
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:41,556
Come on, I'm putting out a fire here.

536
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:44,934
- I fell into a cactus.
- He fell into a cactus.

537
00:34:45,351 --> 00:34:49,856
That's it. Come on. Unless you usually
arrest those who bump into succulents...

538
00:34:49,939 --> 00:34:53,234
...I suggest we go our separate ways
and call it a night.

539
00:34:53,317 --> 00:34:55,987
We still have to fill out a report. We can't-

540
00:34:56,195 --> 00:34:59,365
Listen. I'm not supposed to do this, but...

541
00:34:59,991 --> 00:35:03,745
I have some really beautiful bags
that are exclusive for the press.

542
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:07,373
Do you have girlfriends, wives?
We have earrings, real diamonds.

543
00:35:07,457 --> 00:35:09,667
Beautiful, very tasty. Very delicate.

544
00:35:09,792 --> 00:35:11,544
I saw the bags.

545
00:35:11,961 --> 00:35:13,045
They're nice.

546
00:35:13,129 --> 00:35:15,214
Very nice. The highest quality.

547
00:35:18,801 --> 00:35:23,014
- I guess we don't have to file a report.
- I didn't do anything, you morons!

548
00:35:24,474 --> 00:35:27,143
Diet pills. Usually he's like a pussycat.

549
00:35:27,977 --> 00:35:29,604
- All right.
- All right?

550
00:35:30,146 --> 00:35:32,065
Thank you, guys. All right.

551
00:35:34,484 --> 00:35:36,319
Fellas, one other thing.

552
00:35:36,527 --> 00:35:39,155
I need the tape from the security camera...

553
00:35:39,322 --> 00:35:42,492
...just in case something gets out, all right?

554
00:35:42,992 --> 00:35:45,453
Danny will go with you to get the tape.

555
00:35:48,831 --> 00:35:51,667
Okay. Thank you, fellas.
Appreciate it a lot.

556
00:35:56,172 --> 00:35:59,175
Rent-a-cops. You got me on the edge.
I could go either way!

557
00:35:59,258 --> 00:36:01,302
What were you doing there?

558
00:36:01,385 --> 00:36:03,846
I just wanted to look at her again.

559
00:36:04,013 --> 00:36:08,351
I saw her standing by the pool
and she looked so fantastic.

560
00:36:08,518 --> 00:36:10,019
I just miss her.

561
00:36:10,353 --> 00:36:14,774
Oh, no. Don't give me that look.
I know that look. That look means trouble.

562
00:36:15,024 --> 00:36:19,529
Listen. Calm down. Let's go to your room,
put you to bed and stay out of trouble.

563
00:36:19,695 --> 00:36:23,116
- I wasn't getting in trouble!
- No, no, no.

564
00:36:23,366 --> 00:36:26,536
- Just whacking off on a cactus.
- I wasn't doing that!

565
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,497
It looks as if Eddie Thomas
may have to change...

566
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:34,544
...his middle name to "Peeping"
after an incident tonight at the Hyatt Resort.

567
00:36:34,877 --> 00:36:38,131
This tape from hotel security cameras
clearly shows Thomas...

568
00:36:38,214 --> 00:36:42,427
...in the words of one hotel security
guard, "doing himself a big favour"...

569
00:36:42,927 --> 00:36:45,888
...outside the cottage
where the actor's estranged wife is staying.

570
00:36:46,097 --> 00:36:48,725
Oh, my God.

571
00:36:51,561 --> 00:36:53,563
Oh, my God.

572
00:36:58,109 --> 00:36:59,861
Oh, no.

573
00:37:00,069 --> 00:37:01,988
Thomas and company are in town...

574
00:37:02,071 --> 00:37:05,074
...for a press junket
for the new Eddie and Gwen movie.

575
00:37:05,158 --> 00:37:08,578
Sources tell us this latest incident
comes as no surprise...

576
00:37:08,745 --> 00:37:13,958
...given Thomas' delicate mental state
since he split with his wife and co-star.

577
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:16,002
Any idea what this movie's about?

578
00:37:16,085 --> 00:37:18,171
No. But by the looks of it...

579
00:37:18,421 --> 00:37:21,591
...we're looking at a remake
of Cool Hand Luke.

580
00:37:21,758 --> 00:37:26,512
It was on the news, Lee! He was outside
my cottage doing something not good!

581
00:37:26,763 --> 00:37:29,057
But, Gwen, everybody does it.

582
00:37:29,265 --> 00:37:32,435
I know everyone does it.
That's not the point.

583
00:37:37,356 --> 00:37:39,108
What is going on?

584
00:37:39,525 --> 00:37:41,652
Is he trying to kill me again?

585
00:37:41,861 --> 00:37:44,530
Given the weapon he had in his hand,
I doubt it.

586
00:37:44,614 --> 00:37:47,283
We are luck we're al a Hyatt
People don't kill people at a Hyatt.

587
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:49,744
Other chains, yes, but the Hyatt, no.

588
00:37:50,328 --> 00:37:51,412
Get some rest.

589
00:37:51,537 --> 00:37:54,707
Somebody has to be beautiful tomorrow.
And I think that somebody is you.

590
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:56,334
I know.

591
00:37:56,793 --> 00:37:58,044
I have to go.

592
00:37:58,628 --> 00:37:59,796
Good night.

593
00:38:02,131 --> 00:38:06,302
Eddie, I am so pissed off! I have the tape!
They must have had a copy!

594
00:38:07,053 --> 00:38:10,807
Bastards. You know,
everybody's got a price, kid.

595
00:38:10,973 --> 00:38:14,060
Hold on. Just a second.
It's room service. Hold on.

596
00:38:23,444 --> 00:38:26,197
Eddie, hi. No, it's just...
Hold on one second.

597
00:38:26,406 --> 00:38:30,993
Put it over there. That is beluga, right?
Yeah, thanks.

598
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:34,497
Eddie, we're fine. No, it's all local.
Nothing national.

599
00:38:34,664 --> 00:38:36,874
Plus, they'll issue a retraction tomorrow.

600
00:38:36,999 --> 00:38:39,669
You're fine. Really, there's no damage.

601
00:38:39,836 --> 00:38:41,963
I'm telling you it's just a little blip.

602
00:38:42,171 --> 00:38:44,632
It's what you said. It's in the past.

603
00:38:44,841 --> 00:38:49,637
The beach grass grows towards the sun
in this universe you're grateful for.

604
00:38:50,179 --> 00:38:52,223
You know? Get some rest.

605
00:38:52,432 --> 00:38:56,686
Someone has to look handsome tomorrow,
and I think that someone is you. Okay, Mr. Big Time?

606
00:38:57,687 --> 00:38:59,272
See you in the morning.

607
00:38:59,355 --> 00:39:01,733
- You like Eddie, don't you?
- I love him.

608
00:39:02,024 --> 00:39:04,944
- You leaked the tape.
- Survival rule number three, kid:

609
00:39:05,361 --> 00:39:08,865
You're not here to love anybody.
You're here to promote a movie.

610
00:39:08,948 --> 00:39:10,491
That's it. Period.

611
00:39:11,617 --> 00:39:16,080
You get word your mother died.
Hit by a bus or something.

612
00:39:16,289 --> 00:39:19,375
You go downstairs,
you shed a tear and you say:

613
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:22,962
"It's a shame.
She would've loved this movie."

614
00:39:34,098 --> 00:39:37,101
I have to talk to Eddie.
I'm worried about him.

615
00:39:38,144 --> 00:39:40,605
- You do that.
- You go get him for me.

616
00:39:40,813 --> 00:39:43,483
- Me?
- Yes, I have to talk to him tonight.

617
00:39:43,649 --> 00:39:48,613
Otherwise I'll be up all night and I'll look terrible
in the morning. Really puffy.

618
00:39:50,823 --> 00:39:52,658
I don't think...

619
00:39:54,494 --> 00:39:56,496
- I can't.
- Why not?

620
00:39:57,163 --> 00:40:00,666
Because I'm sleeping.
And because I just...

621
00:40:01,501 --> 00:40:05,963
I feel funny getting in the middle of things
with the two of you.

622
00:40:06,172 --> 00:40:08,007
Can't you handle this yourself?

623
00:40:08,091 --> 00:40:11,844
What are you talking about?
I don't handle anything myself.

624
00:40:12,095 --> 00:40:14,931
- Why are you being so difficult?
- I'm not.

625
00:40:15,139 --> 00:40:19,310
I'm only asking for a teensy-weensy favour.
That's all.

626
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:22,605
Please, Kiki. Please.

627
00:40:22,814 --> 00:40:26,484
Please, please, please, please, Kiki-Kiki-Ki.

628
00:40:26,692 --> 00:40:29,153
Please, Kiki-Ki.

629
00:40:31,697 --> 00:40:33,157
God.

630
00:40:33,366 --> 00:40:34,826
Okay.

631
00:40:36,869 --> 00:40:39,163
Your pillow's better than mine.

632
00:40:39,372 --> 00:40:40,706
Take it.

633
00:41:10,194 --> 00:41:12,280
- Hi.
- Hi.

634
00:41:12,447 --> 00:41:13,614
How are you?

635
00:41:13,698 --> 00:41:17,368
My marriage is shit and I make
crappy movies. Otherwise, I'm great.

636
00:41:17,452 --> 00:41:19,454
Eddie, I'm sorry.

637
00:41:19,662 --> 00:41:21,789
- Why is she doing this?
- I don't know.

638
00:41:21,873 --> 00:41:25,460
- I like your movies.
- They're shit, come on.

639
00:41:25,626 --> 00:41:27,712
What's going on? Did she say anything?

640
00:41:27,795 --> 00:41:30,923
- What happened?
- I'm shocked. I really am shocked.

641
00:41:31,007 --> 00:41:33,634
- I didn't know anything.
- I know I'm not perfect...

642
00:41:33,718 --> 00:41:35,928
...but I thought we had something.

643
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,972
She wants me to move out.

644
00:41:38,181 --> 00:41:39,348
I know.

645
00:41:39,974 --> 00:41:42,435
He'll sit in my chair,
watch my flat-screen TV...

646
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,104
...walk my dog, sleep in my bed with my...

647
00:41:45,354 --> 00:41:48,191
- It's okay.
- I don't know what happened.

648
00:41:49,317 --> 00:41:50,818
Well, it's not you.

649
00:41:52,153 --> 00:41:55,656
You're a great guy,
and if she can't see that, she's blind.

650
00:41:56,657 --> 00:41:59,285
- You are wonderful.
- I don't feel wonderful.

651
00:41:59,702 --> 00:42:00,953
It'll be okay.

652
00:42:02,997 --> 00:42:04,582
I don't think so.

653
00:42:06,626 --> 00:42:08,461
But thanks for saying that.

654
00:42:09,504 --> 00:42:11,881
Thanks for coming. You're really sweet.

655
00:42:11,964 --> 00:42:13,132
No, you are.

656
00:42:13,216 --> 00:42:16,427
No, you are. You're a good friend.

657
00:42:22,141 --> 00:42:23,309
You're a rock.

658
00:42:44,414 --> 00:42:45,665
Hi.

659
00:42:47,834 --> 00:42:50,044
- Come here.
- Nice to see you.

660
00:42:50,336 --> 00:42:51,587
You, too.

661
00:42:52,422 --> 00:42:55,049
- You look good.
- Misery agrees with me.

662
00:42:55,258 --> 00:42:57,176
- You look good, too.
- Thank you.

663
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:01,681
You've been getting healthy.
You been lifting a little weights?

664
00:43:01,889 --> 00:43:05,184
Not lifting weights
so much as losing weight.

665
00:43:05,393 --> 00:43:08,062
- You always looked good to me.
- Thanks.

666
00:43:08,229 --> 00:43:10,606
- You want something to drink?
- I'm fine.

667
00:43:10,773 --> 00:43:11,858
Sit down.

668
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:15,278
It's been too long.
The last time I saw you-

669
00:43:15,361 --> 00:43:18,239
That night. I feel terrible about that.

670
00:43:19,574 --> 00:43:22,910
That was the low point.
I'd found out about Hector and Gwen.

671
00:43:22,994 --> 00:43:26,414
You came to help me out,
I took advantage of the situation.

672
00:43:26,497 --> 00:43:30,001
Talk about bottoming out. I was drunk.
I think I kissed you.

673
00:43:32,462 --> 00:43:33,379
Did I?

674
00:43:35,423 --> 00:43:37,258
I don't remember.

675
00:43:37,425 --> 00:43:38,968
If I did will you forgive me?

676
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:41,471
- Sure. Yeah.
- Thanks Kik.

677
00:43:42,764 --> 00:43:43,848
Are you okay?

678
00:43:43,931 --> 00:43:48,352
A couple of hours ago, I'd have said no,
but something happened tonight that was really incredible.

679
00:43:48,603 --> 00:43:53,733
I was out walking by the cottages, and
it was like Gwen was drawing me to her.

680
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:55,860
I just look over this wall.

681
00:43:55,943 --> 00:44:00,281
There she was, she was standing by the pool,
all dressed in white...

682
00:44:00,448 --> 00:44:03,451
...like an angel in the desert.
I thought to myself:

683
00:44:03,618 --> 00:44:06,829
"That's why you're here.
You're supposed to win her back."

684
00:44:06,954 --> 00:44:08,956
No way she'll stay with Hector.

685
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,710
That's the woman I'm supposed to spend
the rest of my life with.

686
00:44:13,294 --> 00:44:17,298
Really? The woman by the pool?

687
00:44:19,467 --> 00:44:20,551
Gwen.

688
00:44:21,761 --> 00:44:24,555
- That's why I'm here.
- What do you mean?

689
00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:32,230
- Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm are rocking out.
- What are you talking about?

690
00:44:32,438 --> 00:44:34,148
Kiki and Eddie are coming down.

691
00:44:34,232 --> 00:44:36,776
- Why did you say that?
- It's code. It's fun.

692
00:44:36,943 --> 00:44:38,736
I wonder what she wants.

693
00:44:38,903 --> 00:44:42,323
I don't know what she wants.
It'd be good to find out.

694
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:43,908
I know what I want.

695
00:44:43,991 --> 00:44:47,286
Siegfried and Roy left the building,
heading for the pool.

696
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:50,248
- Siegfried and Roy are here?
- Not the real Siegfried-

697
00:44:50,331 --> 00:44:52,625
You wanted to play this game, schmuck.

698
00:44:52,708 --> 00:44:55,670
Heads, she never sees me again.
Tails, we get back together.

699
00:44:55,753 --> 00:44:57,880
- You need to flip a coin for that?
- Correct.

700
00:44:58,005 --> 00:45:00,383
Here we go. One, two, three.

701
00:45:00,842 --> 00:45:02,844
- Possum.
- A possible possum.

702
00:45:04,512 --> 00:45:06,013
Wait, not here.

703
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:10,560
Felix, this is Oscar. The monkey is
in day-care. Repeat, monkey is in day-care.

704
00:45:26,909 --> 00:45:28,911
Your mystery date awaits.

705
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:31,414
Wish me luck.

706
00:45:55,855 --> 00:46:00,651
Oh, Eddie. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

707
00:46:01,194 --> 00:46:05,740
I know you'll never forgive me,
but please, please take me back.

708
00:46:07,533 --> 00:46:10,495
That a gun in your pocket
or are you just happy to see me?

709
00:46:10,578 --> 00:46:12,121
Actually, it's a gun.

710
00:46:36,604 --> 00:46:38,689
- Hello, Eddie.
- Hi, Gwen.

711
00:46:38,898 --> 00:46:41,734
- I've been so worried about you.
- Have you been?

712
00:46:43,111 --> 00:46:46,697
That's how it goes when your wife
shacks up with somebody else.

713
00:46:47,407 --> 00:46:49,367
I've got a lot of anger to deal with.

714
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:53,955
I understand. Get that out.
Just shake it out. Throw it away.

715
00:46:54,163 --> 00:46:56,249
That's great advice. Thank you.

716
00:46:56,499 --> 00:46:58,459
I know I have no right to ask you this-

717
00:46:58,584 --> 00:47:00,878
- Ask me what?
- When we did the movie...

718
00:47:01,003 --> 00:47:03,005
...did you fool around with anybody?

719
00:47:03,089 --> 00:47:07,969
You're right. You've got no right to ask me that.
And no, for your information I wasn't fooling around.

720
00:47:08,219 --> 00:47:12,390
- The girl who played your daughter?
- Are you out of your mind? What the hell is wrong with you, Gwen?

721
00:47:12,473 --> 00:47:15,393
- You're very hostile.
- I can't imagine why.

722
00:47:15,476 --> 00:47:16,936
This was a big mistake.

723
00:47:17,019 --> 00:47:19,397
- No, it wasn't.
- Yes, it was. Tomorrow...

724
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:22,608
...let's be professional
and promote this movie...

725
00:47:22,817 --> 00:47:25,820
...because we both need this one
to do well.

726
00:47:26,028 --> 00:47:27,447
I know you do.

727
00:47:29,282 --> 00:47:34,245
And if they ask about the break-up,
we just say that it was a difficult time...

728
00:47:34,495 --> 00:47:37,165
...that we're working through it together.

729
00:47:37,623 --> 00:47:40,334
- And we're still really close, okay?
- Fine.

730
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,628
- Whatever.
- Good.

731
00:47:43,671 --> 00:47:44,922
I have to go.

732
00:47:50,845 --> 00:47:52,221
I see you tomorrow.

733
00:47:52,305 --> 00:47:53,556
You're not...

734
00:47:56,851 --> 00:48:00,063
- Here. There you go.
- Thanks.

735
00:48:54,826 --> 00:48:58,955
That's how junkets go.
It's a great opportunity. I can handle it.

736
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:02,667
Is this a scene from their new movie,
Time Over Time?

737
00:49:02,875 --> 00:49:07,046
No. That's Gwen Harrison and Eddie
Thomas dancing in the moonlight for real.

738
00:49:07,588 --> 00:49:10,925
- Hard to believe...
- What the hell is going on?

739
00:49:11,592 --> 00:49:13,469
...in a passionate embrace.

740
00:49:13,803 --> 00:49:14,971
Goddamn it!

741
00:49:15,054 --> 00:49:17,265
My life is so stressful.

742
00:49:17,473 --> 00:49:20,184
People have no idea
what it's like being me.

743
00:49:20,393 --> 00:49:22,186
- Did we brush my teeth?
- Yes.

744
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:24,397
See? I can't even remember that.

745
00:49:26,065 --> 00:49:29,652
Good morning, you two.
Come on, smile. Here we go. Smile.

746
00:49:29,861 --> 00:49:33,448
Ladies and gentlemen, here they are,
Eddie and Gwen, together again!

747
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,454
There they are! America's Sweethearts!

748
00:49:46,085 --> 00:49:48,129
What is this? Only five minutes?

749
00:49:48,212 --> 00:49:51,340
Mention jerking-off and I'll pull your plug,
so to speak.

750
00:49:51,424 --> 00:49:55,553
Five minutes is plenty of time
to talk about a movie I haven't seen.

751
00:49:55,762 --> 00:49:57,597
Yeah, but it's fabulous.

752
00:50:01,225 --> 00:50:02,769
Do you need anything?

753
00:50:03,978 --> 00:50:05,897
- Doesn't she look great?
- Who?

754
00:50:06,105 --> 00:50:08,316
Your sister. She looks incredible.

755
00:50:08,608 --> 00:50:13,071
- Are you trying to make me jealous?
- Is it possible to do that at this point?

756
00:50:13,279 --> 00:50:15,114
Then why care if I try?

757
00:50:15,323 --> 00:50:17,200
Okay, who's happy? Ready to go?

758
00:50:17,283 --> 00:50:19,577
Thanks. Always a pleasure. Here we go.

759
00:50:19,702 --> 00:50:21,412
Byron, it's all yours.

760
00:50:23,873 --> 00:50:26,793
Byron Allen, coming to you
from Entertainment Studios. com.

761
00:50:27,001 --> 00:50:30,671
Strap yourself in,
I'm sitting with America's Sweethearts:

762
00:50:30,838 --> 00:50:32,882
Eddie Thomas and Gwen Harrison.

763
00:50:33,007 --> 00:50:36,135
And are you ready for this?
They're not trying to kill each other.

764
00:50:36,511 --> 00:50:40,098
Are you back together?
You look very comfortable with each other.

765
00:50:40,348 --> 00:50:43,643
I want to be honest with you.
Before I came down from the room...

766
00:50:43,726 --> 00:50:46,187
...I took about half a pound of Vicodin.

767
00:50:46,938 --> 00:50:49,148
I'll be comfortable till late March.

768
00:50:54,445 --> 00:50:57,115
You're funny.
How do you live with him, Gwen?

769
00:50:57,365 --> 00:50:58,741
She doesn't.

770
00:51:00,118 --> 00:51:02,036
She lives with someone else.

771
00:51:04,956 --> 00:51:07,500
It must've been exciting
working with Hal Weidmann.

772
00:51:07,625 --> 00:51:10,002
Were you apprehensive when you started?

773
00:51:10,211 --> 00:51:13,214
Oh, no. No, Hal's brilliant.

774
00:51:14,715 --> 00:51:16,467
He's so easy to work with.

775
00:51:16,551 --> 00:51:18,678
He loves actors.

776
00:51:18,886 --> 00:51:20,346
Just loves actors.

777
00:51:20,805 --> 00:51:23,683
You had a nervous breakdown recently,
didn't you?

778
00:51:24,809 --> 00:51:25,810
What?

779
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:30,690
Will audiences watch you again without
remembering your attack on Ms. Harrison?

780
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:33,401
That's five minutes.

781
00:51:33,484 --> 00:51:34,861
Thank you, Dave.

782
00:51:36,571 --> 00:51:40,324
It was so great meeting you guys.
I'm a huge fan.

783
00:51:40,908 --> 00:51:41,659
Lunch?

784
00:51:47,123 --> 00:51:48,958
Why does he get a neck rub?

785
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,502
- I want one.
- He's so tense.

786
00:51:51,711 --> 00:51:55,465
Hello? I have a neck, too.
This thing holding up my head.

787
00:51:56,549 --> 00:51:57,800
And we're back.

788
00:51:58,426 --> 00:52:00,720
- Everybody ready?
- Of course.

789
00:52:02,263 --> 00:52:03,347
Of course.

790
00:52:06,893 --> 00:52:10,897
Hello again, Syracuse.
I'm Mort Josephson, your movie maven.

791
00:52:11,105 --> 00:52:14,442
Ann Arbor, I'm Laura Messinger,
Channel Seven's cinemaniac.

792
00:52:14,525 --> 00:52:16,819
- The popcorn's buttered.
- The lights are dimming.

793
00:52:16,903 --> 00:52:18,863
- It's time to join Bob-
- And Ken.

794
00:52:18,946 --> 00:52:20,615
At the Multiplex.

795
00:52:21,032 --> 00:52:25,119
Eddie and I are great friends.
We talk every day.

796
00:52:25,328 --> 00:52:29,248
Eddie and I are better friends
than we've ever been. We talk two...

797
00:52:29,499 --> 00:52:31,042
...three times a day.

798
00:52:31,125 --> 00:52:34,629
We're just cosmically,
like, spiritually bound.

799
00:52:34,796 --> 00:52:36,547
Eddie's really good...

800
00:52:36,756 --> 00:52:39,217
...and he's my pillar of strength.

801
00:52:39,425 --> 00:52:43,012
It's like Sodom and Gomorrah.
I mean, so strong, you know?

802
00:52:43,262 --> 00:52:44,889
And that's five minutes.

803
00:52:44,972 --> 00:52:48,142
In spite of all the emotion
and the hurting...

804
00:52:49,352 --> 00:52:51,729
...we leaned on each other for support.

805
00:52:51,979 --> 00:52:54,440
That's when I realized how strong...

806
00:52:55,274 --> 00:52:57,235
...our friendship really was.

807
00:52:58,194 --> 00:53:00,405
- We were in constant contact.
- That's right.

808
00:53:00,488 --> 00:53:03,449
I mean, not only are we great friends...

809
00:53:03,658 --> 00:53:06,577
...and not only
are we in constant contact...

810
00:53:06,786 --> 00:53:09,163
You should see some of the phone bills.

811
00:53:09,831 --> 00:53:10,998
We've also done...

812
00:53:11,124 --> 00:53:15,336
I don't know, how should I put this?
Hell, I'll just say it.

813
00:53:15,753 --> 00:53:17,797
We've done a couple of three-ways.

814
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,882
This guy she's with now...

815
00:53:20,007 --> 00:53:22,969
I can't say I'm happy about it.
She's my wife.

816
00:53:23,177 --> 00:53:25,930
But after spending time
in the sack with him...

817
00:53:26,055 --> 00:53:27,765
...I see the attraction.

818
00:53:28,349 --> 00:53:30,435
I have to say, for a fairly big guy...

819
00:53:30,518 --> 00:53:33,062
...he's not packing much
south of the border.

820
00:53:33,187 --> 00:53:36,149
And that's five minutes.
Thank you so much.

821
00:53:36,357 --> 00:53:39,277
Say hi to everybody in Salt Lake.
Good to see you.

822
00:53:40,236 --> 00:53:40,987
Next.

823
00:53:41,612 --> 00:53:43,114
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, guys.

824
00:53:43,364 --> 00:53:45,742
- It wasn't very funny.
- It was a joke.

825
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:47,618
I do that after 400 interviews.

826
00:53:47,702 --> 00:53:50,413
- Hector won't find it very funny.
- Guess what?

827
00:53:50,621 --> 00:53:53,291
I don't give a shit what Hector thinks.

828
00:53:54,125 --> 00:53:56,043
A picture with my baby?

829
00:53:56,627 --> 00:53:58,588
Just smile and shut up.

830
00:54:04,677 --> 00:54:06,721
You have given me 110 percent today.

831
00:54:07,055 --> 00:54:08,389
- Who has? Me?
- You have.

832
00:54:08,473 --> 00:54:09,974
It's been a great day.

833
00:54:10,058 --> 00:54:12,727
- What do you want?
- It has. A small favour.

834
00:54:12,935 --> 00:54:14,645
-45 minutes, an hour.
- No.

835
00:54:14,729 --> 00:54:17,190
- I need you to have dinner with Gwen.
- No.

836
00:54:17,273 --> 00:54:19,901
- It'll be great.
- It won't, because I won't do it.

837
00:54:19,984 --> 00:54:21,736
- You must.
- I'm going to my room.

838
00:54:21,819 --> 00:54:24,655
I'll go into the minibar,
spend time with myself.

839
00:54:24,739 --> 00:54:26,699
We're in deep shit. We don't have the film.

840
00:54:26,783 --> 00:54:30,369
Hal's holding the film hostage.
We have nothing! Understand?

841
00:54:30,661 --> 00:54:33,039
But I do have you. You and Gwen.

842
00:54:33,122 --> 00:54:36,334
When you two are together,
the press forgets there's no film.

843
00:54:36,417 --> 00:54:39,670
It's roses blooming, flags flying,
butterscotch pudding.

844
00:54:39,837 --> 00:54:42,048
- Are you on something?
- It's a panic high.

845
00:54:42,173 --> 00:54:46,094
Just order an entrÃ©e, chew a little bit,
smile and go.

846
00:54:46,344 --> 00:54:48,554
They have a delightful pork tenderloin tonight.

847
00:54:48,679 --> 00:54:50,390
8.00. Thank you so much!

848
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:51,891
- It was Gwen's idea.
- Really?

849
00:54:51,974 --> 00:54:52,809
Absolutely.

850
00:54:54,644 --> 00:54:57,563
I can't believe you said
I'd have dinner with him.

851
00:54:57,688 --> 00:55:00,400
I hear they serve
a very nice pork tenderloin.

852
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:03,194
I'm not going. Here.

853
00:55:03,694 --> 00:55:06,906
I've been with him enough today
for the rest of my life.

854
00:55:07,490 --> 00:55:09,867
I have to give him the divorce papers.

855
00:55:10,368 --> 00:55:11,619
When will you do that?

856
00:55:11,994 --> 00:55:13,579
Just before we leave.

857
00:55:14,163 --> 00:55:17,500
What, will you toss them at him
as your limo pulls away?

858
00:55:17,708 --> 00:55:20,336
Kiki, you don't understand. It's complicated.

859
00:55:20,878 --> 00:55:24,465
I'm trying to be nice to him, so it'll be easier
when I give him the papers.

860
00:55:24,549 --> 00:55:27,009
But if I'm nice, he thinks there's hope.

861
00:55:27,385 --> 00:55:29,512
- Is that your foot?
- Sorry.

862
00:55:30,555 --> 00:55:32,265
Pedicure. Hello?

863
00:55:32,515 --> 00:55:36,269
- So when you're nice, he thinks-
- I can't talk about it right now.

864
00:55:37,061 --> 00:55:40,189
It's so hard being someone
people just don't get over.

865
00:55:41,566 --> 00:55:44,902
- Tell him I have a headache.
- I won't lie for you.

866
00:55:45,111 --> 00:55:47,572
- You lie for me all the time.
- Not to him.

867
00:55:48,531 --> 00:55:51,659
This is high school all over again.
Nothing's changed.

868
00:55:51,868 --> 00:55:55,037
When you wanted to break up
with your boyfriends at high school, did you do it?

869
00:55:55,121 --> 00:55:56,456
No, you made me do it.

870
00:55:56,539 --> 00:55:58,750
- I did not.
- Oh, please.

871
00:55:58,958 --> 00:56:01,502
Let's refresh your memory.
Robert Mancuta?

872
00:56:02,378 --> 00:56:04,922
Kyle Hassler? Toby Franks?
Half the lacrosse team?

873
00:56:05,006 --> 00:56:08,176
By the end of the year,
I was the most hated girl in school.

874
00:56:08,259 --> 00:56:09,343
That's not true.

875
00:56:09,427 --> 00:56:14,182
My quote in the yearbook was,
"Hey, we have to talk." I was despised.

876
00:56:14,766 --> 00:56:16,893
Fine. Don't go.

877
00:56:17,685 --> 00:56:21,606
Eddie will sit there like an idiot.
And it'll be all your fault.

878
00:56:23,566 --> 00:56:24,650
Whatever.

879
00:56:29,989 --> 00:56:31,574
- How are you?
- Lee.

880
00:56:32,033 --> 00:56:33,910
- Where's the film?
- What?

881
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:37,663
The film's in its canister,
waiting to be shown, to go into history.

882
00:56:37,789 --> 00:56:39,415
There is no film, is there?

883
00:56:39,499 --> 00:56:43,836
What have I seen five times that gave me
the best feeling I've ever had in a theatre?

884
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,589
You'll have a great time. See you later.

885
00:56:47,298 --> 00:56:50,676
We're doomed. We're dead.
We're doomed. Thank you.

886
00:57:07,693 --> 00:57:09,987
Look at you. You clean up good.

887
00:57:10,238 --> 00:57:11,239
Thanks.

888
00:57:11,614 --> 00:57:12,698
What's going on?

889
00:57:12,782 --> 00:57:16,619
Gwen isn't feeling well,
so she won't make it to dinner.

890
00:57:19,414 --> 00:57:20,665
She isn't sick.

891
00:57:20,832 --> 00:57:22,083
Not physically.

892
00:57:23,584 --> 00:57:26,254
I just didn't want you to sit here,
wondering.

893
00:57:26,337 --> 00:57:28,005
Thanks. Really.

894
00:57:29,173 --> 00:57:31,884
Want to join me? Come on.
Haven't you read the papers?

895
00:57:31,968 --> 00:57:35,638
I'm unstable. Don't let me alone with me.
Join me. We'll catch up.

896
00:57:35,763 --> 00:57:37,598
- A few minutes.
- Yeah.

897
00:57:39,809 --> 00:57:41,436
We have an understudy.

898
00:57:42,228 --> 00:57:44,689
They never make it easy, do they?

899
00:57:45,398 --> 00:57:47,108
The house phone, please.

900
00:57:50,236 --> 00:57:51,404
Thank you.

901
00:57:52,905 --> 00:57:55,825
Hello, darling.
Holly Golightly's cottage, please?

902
00:57:56,242 --> 00:57:57,910
- Who's that?
- Gwen's code name.

903
00:57:57,994 --> 00:57:59,912
From Breakfast at Tiffany's.

904
00:58:00,204 --> 00:58:01,372
What's that?

905
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:04,208
It's a movie, a great movie.

906
00:58:04,292 --> 00:58:06,210
- Hepburn?
- Right. Katharine.

907
00:58:09,046 --> 00:58:10,590
Let me tell you something:

908
00:58:10,673 --> 00:58:14,510
Don't tell anybody
you're in the movie business. Thank you.

909
00:58:15,470 --> 00:58:17,555
Hello? Hey, Gwen, it's Lee.

910
00:58:17,764 --> 00:58:20,725
I'm at the restaurant, and guess what?
You're not.

911
00:58:21,350 --> 00:58:22,769
Are you okay?

912
00:58:23,061 --> 00:58:24,312
Oh, that's too bad.

913
00:58:24,437 --> 00:58:27,774
No, Eddie's fine. He's with Kiki.
She looks unbelievable.

914
00:58:27,899 --> 00:58:30,276
It may be a little
Hello, Young Lovers for me.

915
00:58:30,359 --> 00:58:33,946
I may have some fires to put out later.
But that's my problem.

916
00:58:34,238 --> 00:58:37,200
Have a nice night.
Feel better. Okay. 'Bye.

917
00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:39,035
Five minutes.

918
00:58:39,118 --> 00:58:41,037
- You're amazing.
- Take notes, kid.

919
00:58:42,497 --> 00:58:43,581
Larry Flange for Let's Go to the Movies.

920
00:58:43,706 --> 00:58:47,085
I'm sitting here with the lovely
and talented Miss Kiki Harrison.

921
00:58:47,168 --> 00:58:50,671
You play a lesbian fire-fighter
on an oil rig in the North Sea.

922
00:58:50,755 --> 00:58:54,258
One word comes to mind: Typecasting.
Your thoughts. And then:

923
00:58:54,342 --> 00:58:56,469
You really want my thoughts?

924
00:58:58,137 --> 00:58:59,305
- Larry.
- Larry.

925
00:58:59,847 --> 00:59:01,182
Okay, Larry...

926
00:59:01,474 --> 00:59:02,934
...the truth is...

927
00:59:05,686 --> 00:59:08,231
...after playing Madame Curie...

928
00:59:08,898 --> 00:59:11,109
...and discovering radium...

929
00:59:11,818 --> 00:59:14,028
...I just thought it would be a hoot...

930
00:59:14,112 --> 00:59:17,073
...to strap on those big rubber boots...

931
00:59:17,407 --> 00:59:21,244
...kiss my favourite gal goodbye
and go fight some fire.

932
00:59:21,369 --> 00:59:22,870
Very personal role for you.

933
00:59:22,954 --> 00:59:25,248
- Very close to my heart.
- Nice.

934
00:59:25,498 --> 00:59:28,584
- That's funny. You're funny.
- I am. Yeah.

935
00:59:29,627 --> 00:59:33,464
Remember when we were in Carolina,
doing Silent Run? We rented that go-cart?

936
00:59:33,548 --> 00:59:35,508
You attacked the director...

937
00:59:35,717 --> 00:59:39,762
- I didn't. There was no attacking.
- You rammed him repeatedly.

938
00:59:39,971 --> 00:59:41,222
Then you rammed me.

939
00:59:41,347 --> 00:59:43,641
He cut me off. Ramming you was different.

940
00:59:43,725 --> 00:59:45,393
And you rammed Gwen.

941
00:59:46,853 --> 00:59:49,063
- She wasn't laughing, and we were.
- Furious.

942
00:59:49,188 --> 00:59:51,649
- She wasn't too happy.
- No.

943
00:59:52,525 --> 00:59:54,736
That memory kept popping in my head.

944
00:59:54,986 --> 00:59:56,738
Those were good times.

945
01:00:00,658 --> 01:00:02,243
I'm sorry I didn't call you.

946
01:00:02,326 --> 01:00:04,787
She's your sister. I understand.

947
01:00:05,037 --> 01:00:08,624
But you're my friend,
and I just let myself get kind of...

948
01:00:08,833 --> 01:00:12,420
It's good to see you now.

949
01:00:13,629 --> 01:00:15,339
That's a nice necklace.

950
01:00:16,382 --> 01:00:18,134
It's not really mine.

951
01:00:18,342 --> 01:00:19,343
I know.

952
01:00:19,552 --> 01:00:21,846
- It's Gwen's.
- I know.

953
01:00:22,055 --> 01:00:23,306
She gave it to me.

954
01:00:23,431 --> 01:00:25,433
And I gave it to her.

955
01:00:27,518 --> 01:00:28,686
I know.

956
01:00:29,437 --> 01:00:32,106
- It looks good on you, though.
- Thank you.

957
01:00:34,734 --> 01:00:36,235
What are you thinking right now?

958
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:40,573
I'm thinking about something
I shouldn't be thinking about.

959
01:00:40,782 --> 01:00:43,159
Me, too. What were you thinking about?

960
01:00:43,284 --> 01:00:45,995
How much I really want to eat
that breadstick.

961
01:00:46,204 --> 01:00:48,081
You want to eat this?

962
01:00:48,289 --> 01:00:51,793
No, I don't eat bread.
I just dream about bread.

963
01:00:52,043 --> 01:00:55,129
I've been going to a lot
of dream analysis since I...

964
01:00:55,213 --> 01:00:56,964
- ... cracked up.
- At the centre.

965
01:00:57,048 --> 01:00:59,425
At the centre. And I believe...

966
01:00:59,926 --> 01:01:03,846
...bread represents something forbidden
you want but can't have.

967
01:01:04,055 --> 01:01:05,223
What do you think?

968
01:01:05,306 --> 01:01:09,602
I think when I dream about bread...

969
01:01:09,811 --> 01:01:11,813
...that would represent...

970
01:01:13,398 --> 01:01:14,482
...bread.

971
01:01:15,316 --> 01:01:16,651
Pretty much.

972
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:20,238
What are you thinking about?

973
01:01:21,906 --> 01:01:22,907
Gwen...

974
01:01:24,492 --> 01:01:25,660
...is here.

975
01:01:28,162 --> 01:01:29,956
Sorry I'm late.

976
01:01:30,164 --> 01:01:33,459
- Thought you weren't well.
- All better. Just like that.

977
01:01:33,709 --> 01:01:35,128
Thanks. You can go.

978
01:01:35,211 --> 01:01:37,422
- She doesn't have to go.
- No, it's fine.

979
01:01:37,505 --> 01:01:39,882
- Stay. Have dinner with us.
- Good to see you.

980
01:01:39,966 --> 01:01:42,510
- I need some mouthwash.
- Okay, right away.

981
01:01:43,344 --> 01:01:44,887
So...

982
01:01:45,096 --> 01:01:48,474
I hear they have great pork tenderloin.
Yummy.

983
01:01:48,558 --> 01:01:51,978
- She didn't have to go.
- Thank you, honey. You look great, too.

984
01:01:58,109 --> 01:02:01,487
- Excuse me. Is Holly Golightly here?
- What is the name?

985
01:02:01,571 --> 01:02:02,947
Holly Golightly.

986
01:02:03,197 --> 01:02:06,159
- What the hell is he doing here?
- I'll get rid of him.

987
01:02:06,242 --> 01:02:09,370
No. Get a camera.
Film, tape, anything. Go, go!

988
01:02:10,288 --> 01:02:12,415
It's Gwen Harrison. The actress?

989
01:02:12,582 --> 01:02:15,626
- Lee Phillips. We met the other day.
- Where is Gwen?

990
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:18,421
- I want to see my Gwen.
- I don't want to get involved.

991
01:02:18,504 --> 01:02:21,132
You're all adults.
People in love, how to stop them?

992
01:02:21,215 --> 01:02:24,635
What are you talking about?
Where's Gwen? I want to see her now.

993
01:02:24,761 --> 01:02:29,015
I can't cover for them anymore.
They're in the restaurant. That's all I'll say.

994
01:02:29,098 --> 01:02:32,769
They're right over there.
She's in the red dress, over there.

995
01:02:37,523 --> 01:02:38,983
- Hi.
- Hector!

996
01:02:40,526 --> 01:02:41,694
Jesus.

997
01:02:41,903 --> 01:02:43,821
- That's all right.
- Hi, Gene.

998
01:02:44,030 --> 01:02:45,990
Don't wave at him like that.

999
01:02:46,199 --> 01:02:47,867
I promote my movies.

1000
01:02:48,076 --> 01:02:48,993
I know.

1001
01:02:49,368 --> 01:02:50,745
It's part of the biz.

1002
01:02:50,828 --> 01:02:52,080
I apologize.

1003
01:02:52,330 --> 01:02:53,790
- I'm sorry.
- Hector.

1004
01:02:53,998 --> 01:02:56,292
- I apologize for him, too.
- Hector's here.

1005
01:02:56,417 --> 01:02:59,337
What's going on?
For why are you sitting with him?

1006
01:02:59,712 --> 01:03:02,632
Get in there.
Would you get out of the way?

1007
01:03:04,008 --> 01:03:06,719
Good. Get that side. Let's go.

1008
01:03:07,011 --> 01:03:08,471
What are you doing here?

1009
01:03:08,554 --> 01:03:11,015
Protecting the woman I love.
What are you doing?

1010
01:03:11,099 --> 01:03:14,685
- I'll let you two catch up.
- Why don't you be quiet, okay?

1011
01:03:14,894 --> 01:03:17,438
- I'll get to you in a minute.
- Don't point.

1012
01:03:17,772 --> 01:03:19,607
Don't tell me what to do.

1013
01:03:21,275 --> 01:03:24,654
- Don't you trust me, Hector?
- I trust you implicitly.

1014
01:03:25,113 --> 01:03:27,990
It's this asshole I don't trust. I don't!

1015
01:03:28,157 --> 01:03:30,368
"Mecka lecka halava beem sala beem."

1016
01:03:30,576 --> 01:03:32,370
What? What did you say?

1017
01:03:34,205 --> 01:03:36,916
I hope he's not making fun of my accent.

1018
01:03:37,125 --> 01:03:41,212
Okay, enough!
You guys enjoy your little public display!

1019
01:03:41,421 --> 01:03:42,588
I'm leaving.

1020
01:03:42,964 --> 01:03:45,341
Okay, pussy boy's leaving.

1021
01:03:45,591 --> 01:03:48,219
What's the matter? You don't like that?

1022
01:03:48,428 --> 01:03:50,888
Maybe you want to take a swing at me?

1023
01:03:51,347 --> 01:03:53,141
Tall boy. Come on.

1024
01:03:53,641 --> 01:03:54,976
What are you...

1025
01:03:56,144 --> 01:03:57,603
- What is that?
- Let's go.

1026
01:03:57,687 --> 01:03:59,647
Please. Please, make my day.

1027
01:04:01,232 --> 01:04:04,736
You're a genius
beyond my wildest expectations.

1028
01:04:04,944 --> 01:04:08,197
The tracking is up.
Spielberg has moved off of our date.

1029
01:04:08,990 --> 01:04:11,284
This is good! Hit him!

1030
01:04:11,492 --> 01:04:12,952
- Who?
- Anybody.

1031
01:04:13,161 --> 01:04:15,621
- I won't fight you!
- Because you're a pussy boy.

1032
01:04:15,705 --> 01:04:17,915
Because I'm trying to find some peace.

1033
01:04:17,999 --> 01:04:20,668
You want peace? Okay, he wants peace.

1034
01:04:21,586 --> 01:04:24,047
- Pussy boy's leaving.
- Don't you do that.

1035
01:04:24,297 --> 01:04:25,631
Hector, don't.

1036
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:27,508
Don't tell me, "Don't."

1037
01:04:27,717 --> 01:04:29,844
Maybe you want a piece of me, huh?

1038
01:04:30,887 --> 01:04:32,221
- You see?
- Okay?

1039
01:04:34,223 --> 01:04:35,850
Huh, pussy.

1040
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:38,936
There shouldn't be a problem here.

1041
01:04:39,145 --> 01:04:40,313
After all...

1042
01:04:40,813 --> 01:04:44,317
...you stole my wife and I tried to kill you.
We're pretty much even.

1043
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,444
You crumpled duck!

1044
01:04:48,237 --> 01:04:50,198
Oh! Dear me!

1045
01:04:54,619 --> 01:04:55,787
Go away!

1046
01:04:57,914 --> 01:04:59,624
Punk! You hungry?

1047
01:04:59,832 --> 01:05:01,542
Eat this, punk! Eat it!

1048
01:05:01,667 --> 01:05:03,211
Are you hungry?

1049
01:05:07,173 --> 01:05:08,591
I love your work.

1050
01:05:18,309 --> 01:05:19,894
Eddie. You forgot something.

1051
01:05:22,397 --> 01:05:24,273
- Did you see him go down?
- Shut up.

1052
01:05:24,357 --> 01:05:26,901
- Don't tell me to shut up.
- Why did you do that?

1053
01:05:26,984 --> 01:05:28,986
I didn't have to do it. I wanted to.

1054
01:05:29,070 --> 01:05:32,490
- Just deal with it. In there.
- It was my pleasure.

1055
01:05:35,701 --> 01:05:37,203
Did you see that?

1056
01:05:41,499 --> 01:05:43,459
- Everybody back, please.
- Eddie, are you okay?

1057
01:05:45,545 --> 01:05:47,130
Eddie. Are you okay?

1058
01:05:47,338 --> 01:05:51,551
I can feel my nose in the back of my throat.
Is that bad?

1059
01:05:51,759 --> 01:05:53,177
Can you hear me?

1060
01:05:54,554 --> 01:05:57,014
- Let's all just step back.
- Some ice, please.

1061
01:05:58,141 --> 01:06:01,102
I swear to God, Gwen can be just horrible.

1062
01:06:01,310 --> 01:06:06,065
How can you love somebody and not like
them at the same time? Seems strange.

1063
01:06:06,733 --> 01:06:09,277
- You need to lie down.
- I thought I was lying down.

1064
01:06:09,402 --> 01:06:11,612
Why don't we try sitting down?

1065
01:06:12,113 --> 01:06:13,573
There we go.

1066
01:06:14,323 --> 01:06:15,825
Let me have a look.

1067
01:06:17,285 --> 01:06:19,120
- It doesn't look good.
- No?

1068
01:06:19,328 --> 01:06:20,580
Cold.

1069
01:06:22,457 --> 01:06:23,458
What happened?

1070
01:06:23,583 --> 01:06:26,294
I just thought I needed
another humiliating photo op.

1071
01:06:26,919 --> 01:06:29,922
I tried to walk away,
but the guy just kept pushing.

1072
01:06:30,006 --> 01:06:33,843
So I hit him in the tray with my face.
I should've just walked away.

1073
01:06:34,510 --> 01:06:38,264
For some reason these days,
I always do the stupid thing.

1074
01:06:39,432 --> 01:06:41,267
This doesn't look good.

1075
01:07:09,504 --> 01:07:12,465
- What was that?
- Another stupid thing.

1076
01:07:13,216 --> 01:07:16,803
Stupid and maybe verging on crazy or...

1077
01:07:17,637 --> 01:07:19,180
It's fine...

1078
01:07:23,351 --> 01:07:26,312
There he is. The master!

1079
01:07:26,813 --> 01:07:28,731
I'll have whatever he's having.

1080
01:07:29,982 --> 01:07:33,277
I have to say,
you have completely outdone yourself.

1081
01:07:33,361 --> 01:07:36,322
In 24 hours,
you've given us a walk in the woods...

1082
01:07:36,489 --> 01:07:39,158
...a romantic dinner and a fistfight.

1083
01:07:39,492 --> 01:07:41,869
I can't wait to see what happens next.

1084
01:07:43,162 --> 01:07:46,541
Maybe I can get him to commit suicide.
Would you like that?

1085
01:07:48,668 --> 01:07:50,962
I don't know. Let me think about it.

1086
01:07:52,588 --> 01:07:56,259
It won't help the initial release,
but the video will rent like crazy.

1087
01:07:56,342 --> 01:07:58,636
We could do a box like a coffin.

1088
01:07:58,845 --> 01:08:00,847
Yeah. That's good. No, wait.

1089
01:08:01,556 --> 01:08:05,893
Imagine if he killed himself
at the premiere.

1090
01:08:09,188 --> 01:08:12,567
I'm joking. I'm thinking out loud
or whatever you call it.

1091
01:08:13,317 --> 01:08:14,318
Goodnight, Dave.

1092
01:08:14,444 --> 01:08:16,195
Goodnight, Lee.

1093
01:08:19,991 --> 01:08:21,367
Good work!

1094
01:08:34,047 --> 01:08:35,131
Hi.

1095
01:08:44,307 --> 01:08:46,392
Good morning.

1096
01:08:49,145 --> 01:08:50,396
How do you feel?

1097
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:54,609
I feel good. I mean...

1098
01:08:55,234 --> 01:08:57,361
...I feel weird, but I feel good.

1099
01:08:57,487 --> 01:09:00,490
- You?
- I feel something along those lines.

1100
01:09:01,407 --> 01:09:03,326
Good, weird. Weird, good.

1101
01:09:03,910 --> 01:09:07,413
Here's what I was thinking:
What about some breakfast?

1102
01:09:08,414 --> 01:09:10,166
We'll take it from there.

1103
01:09:10,958 --> 01:09:12,210
Okay.

1104
01:09:13,294 --> 01:09:17,048
Why don't you order some breakfast.
I'll brush my teeth first.

1105
01:09:18,257 --> 01:09:21,219
- Can I use your toothbrush?
- Yeah, it's in there.

1106
01:09:28,684 --> 01:09:30,478
Can I get some juice?

1107
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:34,524
Keek? Hello?

1108
01:09:34,774 --> 01:09:37,777
Where are you? Kiki!

1109
01:09:40,488 --> 01:09:41,989
Want some toast?

1110
01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:46,202
You buttered my toast.

1111
01:09:47,578 --> 01:09:49,497
No one's ever buttered my toast before.

1112
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:52,583
I don't eat toast with butter.
I don't eat toast.

1113
01:09:53,459 --> 01:09:56,796
I'll stop talking now
and make an exception.

1114
01:09:56,963 --> 01:09:58,047
Some tea?

1115
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:03,344
It's hot.

1116
01:10:03,469 --> 01:10:05,680
- Here. Okay.
- Thank you.

1117
01:10:10,977 --> 01:10:14,188
No, I'm fine. I look like half a raccoon.
What's going on?

1118
01:10:15,481 --> 01:10:16,941
Now's not a good time.

1119
01:10:17,024 --> 01:10:21,362
Can we do it later? No, don't come here.
I'll come there.

1120
01:10:21,821 --> 01:10:22,822
'Bye.

1121
01:10:23,823 --> 01:10:25,241
That was Gwen.

1122
01:10:25,533 --> 01:10:27,910
- She wants to talk.
- About what?

1123
01:10:28,161 --> 01:10:30,997
I don't know. She didn't say.
But I better...

1124
01:10:31,330 --> 01:10:32,749
...go over there.

1125
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,210
Why didn't you say you'd see her later?

1126
01:10:36,335 --> 01:10:39,338
I did, but she said she'd come here,
and I thought:

1127
01:10:39,505 --> 01:10:44,385
"That's not a good idea." So I'd better
just go over there, given the situation.

1128
01:10:45,219 --> 01:10:47,263
Will you tell her about last night?

1129
01:10:47,346 --> 01:10:50,349
I don't know. I think I'll just let her talk.

1130
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:53,102
- Know what I mean?
- Oh, yeah.

1131
01:10:53,186 --> 01:10:56,773
Sounds like it's important
so I'll just let her say it.

1132
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:59,484
Then I'll go do these dumb interviews.

1133
01:10:59,567 --> 01:11:02,487
I'll come back
and we'll have lunch together.

1134
01:11:02,570 --> 01:11:04,113
Does that sound good?

1135
01:11:24,217 --> 01:11:26,052
You look terrible.

1136
01:11:26,386 --> 01:11:29,097
- Does it hurt?
- Only when I'm awake.

1137
01:11:30,181 --> 01:11:31,724
- He's not here by the way.
- Who?

1138
01:11:31,933 --> 01:11:33,643
- Hector.
- That doesn't matter.

1139
01:11:33,726 --> 01:11:35,269
Is Kiki here, though?

1140
01:11:35,353 --> 01:11:36,604
I doubt it.

1141
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:42,985
I don't know where that girl is.

1142
01:11:43,194 --> 01:11:44,654
"That girl" is here.

1143
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:48,074
Nice of you to join us.

1144
01:11:48,449 --> 01:11:50,034
Where have you been?

1145
01:11:50,243 --> 01:11:53,371
Got up early. Things to do.
Nothing important.

1146
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:57,041
Would you make me
some scrambled eggs?

1147
01:11:57,375 --> 01:12:00,044
- She makes great scrambled eggs.
- I remember.

1148
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:02,380
- Would you like some?
- No.

1149
01:12:02,755 --> 01:12:04,549
Two scrambled eggs. Make mine runny.

1150
01:12:04,632 --> 01:12:06,759
Order room service.
She doesn't have to cook.

1151
01:12:06,843 --> 01:12:08,553
It would be my pleasure.

1152
01:12:11,764 --> 01:12:13,850
What did you want to talk about?

1153
01:12:14,976 --> 01:12:17,770
I think you're doing pretty well, huh?

1154
01:12:18,062 --> 01:12:19,522
Are you feeling okay?

1155
01:12:19,605 --> 01:12:23,025
Yeah, I'm better. I'm shocking myself.

1156
01:12:23,776 --> 01:12:26,154
"I forgot how charming you were, Colonel."

1157
01:12:26,237 --> 01:12:30,158
"And you, Miss Julip.
You're a warm breeze on a cool afternoon."

1158
01:12:32,285 --> 01:12:33,536
What was that?

1159
01:12:33,619 --> 01:12:35,288
"What was that?"

1160
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,374
- What was that movie called?
- I don't remember.

1161
01:12:38,499 --> 01:12:41,127
Kiki! What was that movie called?

1162
01:12:41,794 --> 01:12:43,588
I don't give a shit!

1163
01:12:44,630 --> 01:12:45,882
No, that wasn't it.

1164
01:12:46,007 --> 01:12:49,427
Anyway, you look like you're getting
to a good place.

1165
01:12:49,510 --> 01:12:52,930
Last night, when I saw you and Hector,
I was so conflicted.

1166
01:12:53,181 --> 01:12:54,974
"Conflicted" is the word du jour.

1167
01:12:55,058 --> 01:12:57,101
There's no question about that.

1168
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:01,731
You know what? That's tired. She's tired.

1169
01:13:01,981 --> 01:13:04,108
- Are you seeing anybody?
- Excuse me?

1170
01:13:04,984 --> 01:13:06,611
Are you seeing anybody?

1171
01:13:06,694 --> 01:13:08,321
Let me think about it.

1172
01:13:10,031 --> 01:13:11,657
Um, not...

1173
01:13:14,786 --> 01:13:15,953
...you know...

1174
01:13:17,663 --> 01:13:19,791
- Not technically, no.
- What?

1175
01:13:19,999 --> 01:13:21,709
He said "not technically"!

1176
01:13:26,464 --> 01:13:29,425
That's fascinating."Not technically."

1177
01:13:29,634 --> 01:13:33,137
That's sad. Really, that's a shame.

1178
01:13:33,846 --> 01:13:37,517
Here are your eggs, my darling sister.
I hope they're runny enough.

1179
01:13:37,809 --> 01:13:40,436
And you, son of a bitch!
Here are your eggs!

1180
01:13:40,645 --> 01:13:41,729
There you go!

1181
01:13:41,854 --> 01:13:44,065
- What the hell is wrong with you Kiki?
- A lot, actually.

1182
01:13:44,148 --> 01:13:47,151
I can't believe it's taken me
this long to figure it out.

1183
01:13:47,235 --> 01:13:50,905
I'm going for a long walk now
just to simmer down.

1184
01:13:51,114 --> 01:13:53,991
Before I do,
I'd like to cut through the bullshit.

1185
01:13:54,325 --> 01:13:56,869
The reason he's "not technically"
seeing anyone...

1186
01:13:56,953 --> 01:13:59,330
...is he's still "technically" hung up on you.

1187
01:13:59,414 --> 01:14:02,041
And you! You moron!

1188
01:14:02,542 --> 01:14:06,129
The reason she's here, besides trying
to salvage her precious career...

1189
01:14:06,212 --> 01:14:08,673
...is to serve you with divorce papers.

1190
01:14:08,881 --> 01:14:12,301
I've done all I can do here.
I'm going for a walk because that's...

1191
01:14:12,427 --> 01:14:16,097
Leaving is just something
I've really perfected, so...

1192
01:14:16,347 --> 01:14:18,808
...once more with feeling.

1193
01:14:20,017 --> 01:14:22,145
She was much more fun when she was fat.

1194
01:14:22,228 --> 01:14:23,479
Is that true?

1195
01:14:23,938 --> 01:14:25,398
- What?
- About the papers.

1196
01:14:25,523 --> 01:14:27,608
Yes, but now I don't know what to do.

1197
01:14:27,775 --> 01:14:32,989
Seeing you again and being in front
of the press with you again. We have something, Eddie.

1198
01:14:33,114 --> 01:14:36,284
Maybe I've made
a horrible, horrible mistake.

1199
01:14:36,367 --> 01:14:39,412
Or maybe I should give you the papers.
I don't know.

1200
01:14:41,497 --> 01:14:42,915
You're the devil.

1201
01:14:51,257 --> 01:14:53,342
Kiki! Hold on. I wanna talk.

1202
01:14:53,426 --> 01:14:54,844
- Hold on a minute.
- Let go.

1203
01:14:54,927 --> 01:14:56,971
- I wanna talk to you.
- I don't!

1204
01:14:57,055 --> 01:14:58,890
- Why not?
- You're an idiot.

1205
01:14:58,973 --> 01:15:00,892
For that matter, I'm an idiot, too!

1206
01:15:00,975 --> 01:15:03,603
In that respect,
we're perfect for each other.

1207
01:15:03,686 --> 01:15:07,732
- This is a very complicated situation.
- Let me un-complicate it for you!

1208
01:15:08,066 --> 01:15:12,862
Forget about what happened between us.
It's not gonna work. All right?

1209
01:15:13,071 --> 01:15:15,531
Last night. Last night was great.

1210
01:15:15,782 --> 01:15:19,869
But she calls you this morning
and you can't wait to get to her!

1211
01:15:20,078 --> 01:15:22,538
What is that? It just won't work.

1212
01:15:22,663 --> 01:15:24,665
You'll probably always think of her...

1213
01:15:24,749 --> 01:15:28,336
...and I'll probably always be wondering
if you're thinking of her.

1214
01:15:29,128 --> 01:15:30,296
I just...

1215
01:15:31,089 --> 01:15:33,466
- I need you to know one thing.
- What?

1216
01:15:34,467 --> 01:15:37,512
That woman that you saw
by the pool the other night.

1217
01:15:37,804 --> 01:15:41,307
That woman you just have
to spend the rest of your life with.

1218
01:15:44,519 --> 01:15:45,770
That was me.

1219
01:15:58,449 --> 01:16:00,284
- Good morning.
- 'Morning.

1220
01:16:01,077 --> 01:16:03,162
So here's the buffet.

1221
01:16:04,038 --> 01:16:05,581
What's going on?

1222
01:16:07,041 --> 01:16:09,502
Nothing. I'm great.

1223
01:16:09,961 --> 01:16:11,295
Just great.

1224
01:16:11,713 --> 01:16:14,006
Ma'am, can I get some more butter?

1225
01:16:14,841 --> 01:16:17,385
Word of advice:
When you hit Formica, stop.

1226
01:16:17,719 --> 01:16:21,013
You know the expression,
"falling off the wagon"? This is it.

1227
01:16:21,097 --> 01:16:24,267
But you got 20 or 30 pounds of food
to break your fall.

1228
01:16:24,559 --> 01:16:26,185
What the hell happened?

1229
01:16:26,269 --> 01:16:29,147
Bad morning. Preceded by 33 bad years.

1230
01:16:29,355 --> 01:16:31,399
Does this have to do with Gwen?

1231
01:16:31,607 --> 01:16:35,945
Of course not. I love my sister.
I love everything about her.

1232
01:16:36,362 --> 01:16:39,031
"Kiki. Kiki-kins.

1233
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:41,325
"Who's smoking? I smell smoke.

1234
01:16:41,534 --> 01:16:44,245
"Is someone smoking
within a six-mile radius?

1235
01:16:44,662 --> 01:16:46,581
"Stop them, Kiki. Stop them."

1236
01:16:46,664 --> 01:16:48,750
Oh, ma'am, the butter?

1237
01:16:49,417 --> 01:16:51,711
Are they out of butter?
How can you run out?

1238
01:16:51,794 --> 01:16:53,129
I have one theory.

1239
01:16:53,212 --> 01:16:55,048
You know what? I need an assistant.

1240
01:16:55,131 --> 01:16:58,468
If I had one, she'd be outside right now,
milking a cow...

1241
01:16:58,551 --> 01:17:01,471
...and I'd never, ever run out of butter.

1242
01:17:02,346 --> 01:17:06,267
"Kiki, my butter has touched another food.
I need new butter."

1243
01:17:06,642 --> 01:17:09,604
"Anything you want, honey."
That's how it goes, right?

1244
01:17:09,687 --> 01:17:12,398
You're a publicist.
Anything they want, right?

1245
01:17:14,358 --> 01:17:16,152
She's got a green dress.

1246
01:17:16,486 --> 01:17:18,237
Looks like crap on her.

1247
01:17:18,321 --> 01:17:20,782
Brings out the circles under her eyes.
We both know it.

1248
01:17:20,865 --> 01:17:23,076
She gave it to me. It looks nice on me.

1249
01:17:23,159 --> 01:17:25,787
Then she said maybe she wanted it back.

1250
01:17:26,204 --> 01:17:29,248
She doesn't want it.
She doesn't want me to have it. That's the truth

1251
01:17:30,041 --> 01:17:32,043
So, you're in love with Eddie?

1252
01:17:33,961 --> 01:17:35,630
Wouldn't that be stupid?

1253
01:17:35,963 --> 01:17:38,174
I've done every one of their movies.

1254
01:17:38,424 --> 01:17:41,594
I've never seen him look at her
the way he looks at you.

1255
01:17:41,677 --> 01:17:44,138
If you're in love, just go for it.

1256
01:17:44,972 --> 01:17:47,183
The way you went for this breakfast.

1257
01:17:48,434 --> 01:17:50,895
Not the way you went for the breakfast.

1258
01:17:56,943 --> 01:18:00,196
I think I'm going to be sick. Can you just...

1259
01:18:08,329 --> 01:18:13,209
I'll take all of this to go.
I'll need 20, 30 bags and a forklift.

1260
01:18:15,461 --> 01:18:17,130
No laugh, no tip.

1261
01:18:39,736 --> 01:18:42,572
I really want to play a character
like the Terminator.

1262
01:18:42,655 --> 01:18:46,159
Because I think the Hispanic people
are crying out to see...

1263
01:18:46,409 --> 01:18:50,413
...a deadly, destructive killing machine
they can embrace as their own.

1264
01:18:50,496 --> 01:18:53,750
- That they can relate to.
- How are you? Nice to see you.

1265
01:18:53,958 --> 01:18:56,919
- How are you? Hal here yet?
- No.

1266
01:18:57,420 --> 01:18:59,338
He's a dead man. No, I'm serious.

1267
01:18:59,422 --> 01:19:03,718
I know a guy.
I'll make a call, and he's dead, because...

1268
01:19:03,926 --> 01:19:07,430
How are you? Nice to see you.
Hope you're having a good time.

1269
01:19:07,555 --> 01:19:09,390
- What time do you have?
-12:50.

1270
01:19:09,474 --> 01:19:10,725
We're doomed.

1271
01:19:10,933 --> 01:19:15,480
May I suggest that you follow my lead
and get completely shit-faced?

1272
01:19:15,897 --> 01:19:20,401
- Hi, how are you? You look gorgeous.
- Hi, Mr. K. Thank you.

1273
01:19:20,568 --> 01:19:24,614
How long must I stay with these people?
They're drunk and starting to touch.

1274
01:19:24,697 --> 01:19:27,158
Hang in there.
If Hal doesn't show with the film...

1275
01:19:27,241 --> 01:19:29,786
...they'll be busy finding
where to build the gallows.

1276
01:19:29,911 --> 01:19:31,871
What? I don't think that's funny.

1277
01:19:37,293 --> 01:19:38,753
Is that pussy boy?

1278
01:19:43,383 --> 01:19:45,343
- He's going to jump.
- He's not kinda jump.

1279
01:19:45,551 --> 01:19:47,762
I said I'd give him the divorce papers.

1280
01:19:47,845 --> 01:19:49,597
Shit, he's going to jump!

1281
01:19:50,348 --> 01:19:51,849
- Excuse me.
- Please, please.

1282
01:19:51,933 --> 01:19:53,893
- We got to do something.
- I'll get him.

1283
01:19:53,976 --> 01:19:57,230
Let's take advantage of this.
Get a helicopter. Get aerial shots.

1284
01:19:57,313 --> 01:19:59,524
- Shut up.
- All right, yeah. Okay.

1285
01:20:00,274 --> 01:20:01,359
Jump, jump.

1286
01:20:01,484 --> 01:20:02,652
Jump, pussy, jump.

1287
01:20:04,028 --> 01:20:05,655
I can't believe this.

1288
01:20:08,991 --> 01:20:10,451
He'll be a pussy pancake.

1289
01:20:10,535 --> 01:20:11,702
I'm coming!

1290
01:20:19,544 --> 01:20:21,045
Why is he doing this to me?

1291
01:20:21,129 --> 01:20:22,547
I'm sorry! Are you okay?

1292
01:20:22,630 --> 01:20:23,965
What are you doing?

1293
01:20:24,048 --> 01:20:27,635
- I was trying to stop you from jumping!
- By trying to kill me?

1294
01:20:28,094 --> 01:20:30,638
- Stay right there!
- Where am I gotta go?

1295
01:20:31,597 --> 01:20:32,682
Right!

1296
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:38,521
Oh, shit. Hang in there, Eddie!

1297
01:20:39,397 --> 01:20:40,565
I'm coming!

1298
01:20:43,526 --> 01:20:45,278
- All right.
- You going to hose me down?

1299
01:20:45,361 --> 01:20:47,280
I'll throw it, and you catch it.

1300
01:20:47,363 --> 01:20:48,948
One, two...

1301
01:20:49,031 --> 01:20:50,116
...three.

1302
01:20:54,495 --> 01:20:56,497
Pull yourself up. I got you.

1303
01:20:56,956 --> 01:20:58,124
Come on.

1304
01:20:59,167 --> 01:21:00,251
Got it?

1305
01:21:00,501 --> 01:21:01,419
Good.

1306
01:21:03,796 --> 01:21:05,840
Oh, my God!

1307
01:21:08,009 --> 01:21:09,427
Pussy boy will go splat.

1308
01:21:09,510 --> 01:21:11,345
- Got it?
- Yeah.

1309
01:21:12,346 --> 01:21:15,016
That's it. One foot at a time.
There you go.

1310
01:21:17,018 --> 01:21:18,853
- Okay.
- I'm going to kill you.

1311
01:21:18,936 --> 01:21:21,814
Take a bow. It'll look better. Take a bow.

1312
01:21:28,154 --> 01:21:29,655
Jesus Christ.

1313
01:21:33,159 --> 01:21:36,454
The next time you try to kill yourself,
take a hair dryer into the tub.

1314
01:21:36,537 --> 01:21:39,332
- I wasn't trying to kill myself.
- What were you doing?

1315
01:21:39,499 --> 01:21:42,627
I came here to think. Is that a crime?
Get some perspective?

1316
01:21:42,710 --> 01:21:44,295
Do that in your room!

1317
01:21:48,007 --> 01:21:49,675
I blew it.

1318
01:21:50,718 --> 01:21:51,886
I lost her.

1319
01:21:53,805 --> 01:21:55,431
Guy goes to his rabbi.

1320
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:58,893
He says, "Rabbi, I think my wife
is trying to poison me."

1321
01:21:58,976 --> 01:22:01,187
The rabbi says, "let me talk to her."

1322
01:22:01,312 --> 01:22:05,733
He comes back later, and says, "Listen.
I spoke to your wife for three hours.

1323
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:07,318
"Take the poison."

1324
01:22:08,069 --> 01:22:10,446
Understand what I'm saying? You and Gwen are over.

1325
01:22:10,655 --> 01:22:13,908
I don't care about Gwen!
I'm talking about Kiki.

1326
01:22:14,992 --> 01:22:19,122
She's the only one worth spending
any time with in this hellhole.

1327
01:22:19,706 --> 01:22:23,126
No offence, you're a great guy.
You have some very nice qualities.

1328
01:22:23,209 --> 01:22:26,379
But for a review, you'd sell me
to China for medical experiments.

1329
01:22:26,462 --> 01:22:27,839
Don't let her get away.

1330
01:22:27,922 --> 01:22:31,342
- It's too late.
- No, it's not. Trust me. I'm-

1331
01:22:36,431 --> 01:22:37,974
- That's Hal!
- That's Hal?

1332
01:22:38,057 --> 01:22:40,768
That maniac's here with the film!
We're saved!

1333
01:22:40,852 --> 01:22:42,937
- We're beyond salvation.
- No, come on.

1334
01:22:43,020 --> 01:22:45,231
- You want to see the movie.
- I don't care about the movie.

1335
01:22:45,356 --> 01:22:47,275
This could put you back on top.

1336
01:22:47,358 --> 01:22:48,776
- You think? On top?
- Yes.

1337
01:22:48,860 --> 01:22:50,987
"May I have the envelope, please?"

1338
01:22:52,530 --> 01:22:53,781
Hal! It's Hal.

1339
01:23:00,872 --> 01:23:02,915
He's got the film. Go, go.

1340
01:23:03,124 --> 01:23:04,625
The director.

1341
01:23:04,792 --> 01:23:07,170
- He looks good.
- Yeah, he looks great.

1342
01:23:11,883 --> 01:23:13,342
Everybody? Let's get started.

1343
01:23:13,426 --> 01:23:16,387
I'm Lee Phillips.
Welcome to Time Over Time.

1344
01:23:17,055 --> 01:23:18,306
Thank you.

1345
01:23:19,474 --> 01:23:21,851
I'll go out on a ledge here and say...

1346
01:23:23,269 --> 01:23:24,979
I couldn't help myself.

1347
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:29,400
Please welcome the man responsible
for this junket, Mr. Dave Kingman.

1348
01:23:32,153 --> 01:23:33,905
Thank you very much, Lee.

1349
01:23:34,238 --> 01:23:38,076
They say that good things
come to those who wait.

1350
01:23:38,951 --> 01:23:41,746
I waited 20 years to work
with the great Hal Weidmann.

1351
01:23:41,829 --> 01:23:44,665
I think Hal's cinematic influence
has been felt for-

1352
01:23:44,749 --> 01:23:47,627
That's good. Thank you. That's good.

1353
01:23:47,835 --> 01:23:49,170
Thank you.

1354
01:23:50,755 --> 01:23:53,132
My name is Hal Weidmann. Hello.

1355
01:23:57,095 --> 01:23:59,180
Ladies and gentlemen, this...

1356
01:23:59,430 --> 01:24:03,768
...is the most honest movie
I have ever made.

1357
01:24:04,644 --> 01:24:08,648
I wasn't looking for it.
It came to me like a bus in the street.

1358
01:24:09,023 --> 01:24:13,694
Or the woman who changes the flowers
at our desert house.

1359
01:24:15,363 --> 01:24:18,157
I can't talk about this film
without weeping. Roll it, please.

1360
01:24:19,242 --> 01:24:21,994
Thank you, Hal.
Have a great time, everybody!

1361
01:24:41,556 --> 01:24:43,850
Sarah. My name is Ben. I must speak with you.

1362
01:24:43,975 --> 01:24:45,893
- Who are you?
- That's not important.

1363
01:24:45,977 --> 01:24:50,064
What's important now is your safety.
Listen to me Sarah, you're in grave danger.

1364
01:24:50,148 --> 01:24:53,276
I don't know how to say this,
so I'll just come out and say it:

1365
01:24:53,359 --> 01:24:55,987
- I'm from the future.
- Oh, my God!

1366
01:24:56,571 --> 01:24:58,614
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

1367
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:01,909
Come with me now. Now, Sarah, please.

1368
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:09,375
Love is a bridge built between two people.

1369
01:25:09,584 --> 01:25:12,628
We want what exists between them...

1370
01:25:13,713 --> 01:25:14,797
...to be real.

1371
01:25:14,922 --> 01:25:17,008
My name is Hal Weidmann.

1372
01:25:17,425 --> 01:25:21,095
The film you're about to see is
Time Over Time, or is it?

1373
01:25:22,805 --> 01:25:25,600
The details are unimportant. Simply put...

1374
01:25:25,808 --> 01:25:28,102
...the script was shit. I tossed it.

1375
01:25:28,811 --> 01:25:32,565
- Instead I decided to let my camera capture real life.
- Just watch.

1376
01:25:34,567 --> 01:25:37,779
I filmed my actors
without their knowledge.

1377
01:25:37,987 --> 01:25:42,075
I let the camera run after takes.
I placed hidden cameras around the set.

1378
01:25:42,408 --> 01:25:45,787
And the end resultis a story...

1379
01:25:45,995 --> 01:25:51,209
...far more involving than anything
manufactured by actors and writers.

1380
01:25:53,878 --> 01:25:56,005
This is real life.

1381
01:25:56,255 --> 01:25:57,882
The juice.

1382
01:25:58,466 --> 01:25:59,926
The stink.

1383
01:26:02,136 --> 01:26:03,221
The glory.

1384
01:26:10,311 --> 01:26:13,189
Often, you see a film and think,
"Where did the money go?"

1385
01:26:13,272 --> 01:26:14,273
Shut up!

1386
01:26:18,986 --> 01:26:20,613
It's gonna be good.

1387
01:26:21,155 --> 01:26:24,659
I don't mean to pressure you,
but we're 15 days overschedule.

1388
01:26:24,826 --> 01:26:26,077
Oh, no.

1389
01:26:26,202 --> 01:26:27,912
What are we gonna do?

1390
01:26:28,037 --> 01:26:32,333
I'm in the middle of shooting.
This is a sensitive time. Do me a favour.

1391
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:36,671
Go away. Please.
Never visit my set again.

1392
01:26:40,133 --> 01:26:41,676
Watch him take it...

1393
01:26:41,884 --> 01:26:43,636
...up the gazoo.

1394
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:49,517
You're an idiot. I told you,
we never should've hired Hal Weidmann.

1395
01:26:57,358 --> 01:27:00,445
"You do

1396
01:27:01,028 --> 01:27:04,115
"something to me

1397
01:27:04,741 --> 01:27:06,117
"Something

1398
01:27:06,325 --> 01:27:11,372
"that simply mystifies me

1399
01:27:12,206 --> 01:27:15,084
"Tell me

1400
01:27:15,877 --> 01:27:19,088
"why should it be

1401
01:27:19,464 --> 01:27:20,631
"You have

1402
01:27:21,090 --> 01:27:26,220
"the power to hypnotise me

1403
01:27:26,971 --> 01:27:30,391
"Let me

1404
01:27:30,641 --> 01:27:33,853
"live 'neath your spell"

1405
01:27:34,228 --> 01:27:36,105
You're so good in this.

1406
01:27:36,564 --> 01:27:37,732
"... that voodoo

1407
01:27:38,274 --> 01:27:40,151
"that you do"

1408
01:27:41,736 --> 01:27:42,820
Cut.

1409
01:27:45,531 --> 01:27:49,035
Hal! Hal!
Hal, can I get like three minutes?

1410
01:27:49,744 --> 01:27:52,413
- Gwen, can I talk to you?
- I'm working.

1411
01:27:54,540 --> 01:27:55,875
Yes?

1412
01:27:55,958 --> 01:27:58,044
- What's going on with you and him?
- Nothing.

1413
01:27:58,127 --> 01:27:59,837
His hands are all over your ass.

1414
01:27:59,921 --> 01:28:03,049
My character would've done that
at that point!

1415
01:28:03,174 --> 01:28:06,344
- You look like a freaking prostitute!
- Oh, please. Cut it out.

1416
01:28:06,427 --> 01:28:08,888
- Don't make a fool of me.
- Cut it out.

1417
01:28:09,097 --> 01:28:11,849
I'm watching you every minute.
Do you hear me?

1418
01:28:12,058 --> 01:28:13,643
Cut it out.

1419
01:28:13,976 --> 01:28:15,353
Do you hear me?

1420
01:28:18,815 --> 01:28:20,483
I think Eddie knows.

1421
01:28:20,691 --> 01:28:21,943
Knows what?

1422
01:28:22,777 --> 01:28:24,445
About me and Hector.

1423
01:28:25,446 --> 01:28:29,534
- You said nothing's happening with him.
- Well, something happened.

1424
01:28:34,288 --> 01:28:35,832
Do you see that zit?

1425
01:28:36,958 --> 01:28:38,292
What the hell is this?

1426
01:28:38,376 --> 01:28:39,877
You think I know?

1427
01:28:40,962 --> 01:28:42,130
You bastard!

1428
01:28:42,505 --> 01:28:44,590
- You see it?
- I'll get something.

1429
01:28:45,133 --> 01:28:46,801
I slept with him.

1430
01:28:46,968 --> 01:28:48,219
Hector?

1431
01:28:49,470 --> 01:28:51,597
- Are you in love with him?
- Oh, come on.

1432
01:28:51,681 --> 01:28:55,268
It's not always about love.
Sometimes you just need to get laid.

1433
01:28:58,646 --> 01:29:00,231
I tell you, he's hot.

1434
01:29:01,023 --> 01:29:03,985
Handsome. He can go for hours.

1435
01:29:05,319 --> 01:29:07,947
Just wish he had a bigger,
you know, thingy.

1436
01:29:11,492 --> 01:29:12,744
I love this movie.

1437
01:29:12,827 --> 01:29:14,495
What do you mean?

1438
01:29:14,996 --> 01:29:18,041
It's like a roll of quarters. It's like this.

1439
01:29:22,003 --> 01:29:24,380
Well, maybe like this.

1440
01:29:24,756 --> 01:29:26,132
I know too much.

1441
01:29:29,927 --> 01:29:31,471
I'm going to scream.

1442
01:29:31,721 --> 01:29:34,807
- I think it's very entertaining.
- Lee, get over here!

1443
01:29:36,934 --> 01:29:40,021
You stop this right now.
I mean I'm gonna sue the studio.

1444
01:29:40,229 --> 01:29:41,647
Lower your voice, darling.

1445
01:29:41,731 --> 01:29:43,149
- Cut the film.
- Shut up.

1446
01:29:43,232 --> 01:29:45,526
Excuse me. Was that deserved?

1447
01:29:45,735 --> 01:29:49,405
I think so. You've ruined me.
You've ruined my career.

1448
01:29:49,655 --> 01:29:53,076
Look at the screen.
Don't you realize what that is?

1449
01:29:53,284 --> 01:29:55,953
That's reinvention. That's birth.

1450
01:29:56,162 --> 01:29:59,415
That's life itself. Can't you smell the life?

1451
01:29:59,916 --> 01:30:03,169
Pretty soon you'll smell Ira Stern,
my attorney!

1452
01:30:04,462 --> 01:30:06,464
- Thank you, Hal.
- Wacko.

1453
01:30:07,006 --> 01:30:11,636
The film's new direction caught some of us
a little bit off-guard.

1454
01:30:12,303 --> 01:30:14,680
I am shocked. I'm outraged.

1455
01:30:14,806 --> 01:30:15,973
There are textures!

1456
01:30:16,099 --> 01:30:18,226
Can I just say something, please?

1457
01:30:18,434 --> 01:30:22,605
What was said about my penis
is completely false. Completely.

1458
01:30:22,814 --> 01:30:26,818
I'm extremely well-hung. I'll submit
to a physical inspection right now.

1459
01:30:26,901 --> 01:30:29,445
I knew this film would be misunderstood.

1460
01:30:29,654 --> 01:30:32,490
Kubrick was misunderstood. Godard.

1461
01:30:32,698 --> 01:30:35,243
I'll kick your ass! Understand that!

1462
01:30:35,493 --> 01:30:37,578
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

1463
01:30:37,787 --> 01:30:40,707
- I'm the ass-kicker of you!
- Can I defend my father's work?

1464
01:30:40,790 --> 01:30:42,709
No. Who's her father?

1465
01:30:43,084 --> 01:30:44,669
- Hal.
- No, you cannot!

1466
01:30:44,919 --> 01:30:47,380
Let me defend Hector.
I only slept with him once.

1467
01:30:47,463 --> 01:30:50,133
His penis is bigger than a roll of quarters.

1468
01:30:50,633 --> 01:30:52,385
- You slept with her?
- I did not.

1469
01:30:52,468 --> 01:30:55,471
- You slept with her?
- I swear to God! She's lying.

1470
01:30:55,555 --> 01:30:59,976
Except for the part about my penis.
That's true. It's bigger than coins.

1471
01:31:00,143 --> 01:31:03,479
There will be a law suit.
Legal issues, invasion of privacy.

1472
01:31:03,646 --> 01:31:05,565
- I agree.
- Damage to my career!

1473
01:31:05,648 --> 01:31:07,066
Yes, yes, I know.

1474
01:31:07,316 --> 01:31:10,069
Congratulations.
It's the most honest work I've done.

1475
01:31:10,153 --> 01:31:12,905
- I'll work with you again.
- I've a script we can throw out.

1476
01:31:12,989 --> 01:31:14,157
- You're wonderful.
- I'll send it to you.

1477
01:31:15,283 --> 01:31:16,659
I have an announcement.

1478
01:31:18,244 --> 01:31:20,955
I'd like to thank you all.
I'm so happy you're here...

1479
01:31:21,039 --> 01:31:22,999
...and all our friends in the press...

1480
01:31:23,082 --> 01:31:26,502
...who've been so supportive this last year.

1481
01:31:27,420 --> 01:31:29,464
I'm so happy to say:

1482
01:31:30,631 --> 01:31:33,009
Eddie and I are getting back together.

1483
01:31:38,306 --> 01:31:40,600
So thank you all so, so much.

1484
01:31:40,850 --> 01:31:43,519
- What is this bullshit now?
- Be quiet.

1485
01:31:43,686 --> 01:31:45,980
This is bullshit.

1486
01:31:46,189 --> 01:31:48,649
This morning, Eddie came over to the cottage.

1487
01:31:48,775 --> 01:31:52,528
We had breakfast and a heartfelt talk.
Didn't we, honey?

1488
01:31:52,695 --> 01:31:55,448
I've wanted to get back
together with Gwen...

1489
01:31:55,656 --> 01:32:00,119
...ever since we weren't together anymore.
I've been obsessed about it.

1490
01:32:00,286 --> 01:32:01,371
How sweet.

1491
01:32:01,454 --> 01:32:04,374
Now that it's happened, I have to say:

1492
01:32:04,540 --> 01:32:06,376
I'm amazed, and grateful.

1493
01:32:06,626 --> 01:32:09,253
And I agree with Hector that it's bullshit.

1494
01:32:09,379 --> 01:32:11,172
Thank you, thank you very much!

1495
01:32:11,255 --> 01:32:13,049
- We talked about this.
- We didn't.

1496
01:32:13,132 --> 01:32:14,300
- Yes, we did.
- No we didn't.

1497
01:32:14,384 --> 01:32:16,010
We did. Don't you love me?

1498
01:32:16,219 --> 01:32:19,222
I love the beautiful, bright,
sexy woman up on the screen.

1499
01:32:19,305 --> 01:32:21,432
- He loves me.
- The girl I made movies with.

1500
01:32:21,557 --> 01:32:25,853
That's not the real you, it's you pretending
to be real, which you're really good at.

1501
01:32:25,937 --> 01:32:29,148
In real life, I think I'm with the real you,
but I'm not.

1502
01:32:29,232 --> 01:32:30,942
I'd be with the real you here now...

1503
01:32:31,025 --> 01:32:34,362
...not the real you from the movies.
I don't want to be with you.

1504
01:32:34,445 --> 01:32:35,905
- Why not?
- I just explained it to you.

1505
01:32:35,988 --> 01:32:38,116
- You did?
- I don't want to talk about it.

1506
01:32:38,241 --> 01:32:40,535
- Not in front of these-
- Why not, Eddie?

1507
01:32:40,618 --> 01:32:45,164
You're right. What could I have to say
to you that I don't have to say...

1508
01:32:45,373 --> 01:32:48,793
...in front of 300 members
of the international press?

1509
01:32:49,210 --> 01:32:52,505
I'll tell you why:
I'm in love with your sister.

1510
01:32:55,466 --> 01:32:56,634
Kiki?

1511
01:32:59,846 --> 01:33:01,973
- Is this some kind of joke?
- No.

1512
01:33:02,974 --> 01:33:05,017
Kiki, could you get over here?

1513
01:33:10,606 --> 01:33:12,734
- Why her?
- Oh, why not?

1514
01:33:12,984 --> 01:33:16,487
Is it so unbelievable, unfathomable
that a man could love me?

1515
01:33:16,738 --> 01:33:18,781
- Not now.
- I think now is the time.

1516
01:33:18,865 --> 01:33:20,450
You just wait for me!

1517
01:33:21,159 --> 01:33:22,410
Can I say something?

1518
01:33:22,535 --> 01:33:23,953
- Yes.
- No!

1519
01:33:24,245 --> 01:33:26,456
Okay, one nut at a time.

1520
01:33:26,873 --> 01:33:29,000
You're my sister. I love you.

1521
01:33:29,375 --> 01:33:34,714
And it's important to me that you know nothing happened
between me and Eddie until last night.

1522
01:33:35,131 --> 01:33:38,551
I somehow feel so much better
about you stealing my husband.

1523
01:33:38,634 --> 01:33:41,387
Ex! Ex-husband.
And I didn't steal anything.

1524
01:33:41,554 --> 01:33:45,892
You've been shacked up for the past year
with Ricky Ricardo.

1525
01:33:49,812 --> 01:33:53,399
I am just tired of making excuses.

1526
01:33:53,566 --> 01:33:55,693
I am done picking up dirty clothes.

1527
01:33:55,902 --> 01:33:58,362
I am done pretending...

1528
01:33:58,446 --> 01:34:00,907
...that your life is my whole life.

1529
01:34:01,741 --> 01:34:03,534
I'm just... I'm done.

1530
01:34:03,701 --> 01:34:06,579
So what you're really worried about
is you, right?

1531
01:34:07,997 --> 01:34:09,332
Yes.

1532
01:34:10,750 --> 01:34:14,087
Well, I guess you're fired.

1533
01:34:18,091 --> 01:34:19,842
Honey.

1534
01:34:22,845 --> 01:34:26,432
You know all I care about
is your happiness.

1535
01:34:26,682 --> 01:34:27,767
That's sweet-

1536
01:34:27,850 --> 01:34:32,271
So, don't worry about me. I'll be fine.

1537
01:34:36,609 --> 01:34:38,903
- You're unbelievable.
- Shut up.

1538
01:34:39,529 --> 01:34:41,447
Next? What can I do for you?

1539
01:34:41,531 --> 01:34:45,118
I know I shouldn't have said that
in front of everybody, but...

1540
01:34:45,785 --> 01:34:48,329
For the last year, I've tried to find clarity.

1541
01:34:48,413 --> 01:34:51,833
All of a sudden I am so clear it's ridiculous.

1542
01:34:52,834 --> 01:34:54,460
I want to be with you.

1543
01:34:54,627 --> 01:34:56,713
When did you make this decision?

1544
01:34:57,046 --> 01:34:59,173
The moment I thought I'd lost you.

1545
01:35:00,049 --> 01:35:01,968
- Damn it.
- What?

1546
01:35:02,301 --> 01:35:04,679
That was good.

1547
01:35:07,223 --> 01:35:11,394
No, this is crazy.
Eddie, this isn't going to work.

1548
01:35:11,561 --> 01:35:12,895
Listen to me.

1549
01:35:14,939 --> 01:35:16,524
I'm grateful for you.

1550
01:35:18,192 --> 01:35:21,487
In all the world,
the thing I'm most grateful for...

1551
01:35:21,654 --> 01:35:22,905
...is you.

1552
01:35:26,242 --> 01:35:28,536
If that's a line from one of your movies-

1553
01:35:28,661 --> 01:35:29,996
That one's mine.

1554
01:35:33,458 --> 01:35:34,542
What do we do now?

1555
01:35:34,667 --> 01:35:37,420
Traditionally, we kiss.

1556
01:35:37,670 --> 01:35:38,755
Yeah?

1557
01:35:49,766 --> 01:35:53,102
Give her some room. Thank you.
Step back, please.

1558
01:35:53,936 --> 01:35:55,438
Easy.

1559
01:35:56,939 --> 01:35:59,067
I'm on pain medication...

1560
01:35:59,275 --> 01:36:02,779
...that makes me say things
I'd never say otherwise.

1561
01:36:03,321 --> 01:36:05,990
Just to set the record perfectly straight...

1562
01:36:06,282 --> 01:36:09,285
...Eddie and I never had
any plans to reconcile.

1563
01:36:09,952 --> 01:36:10,953
And?

1564
01:36:11,162 --> 01:36:13,790
And Hector is very well-endowed.

1565
01:36:13,956 --> 01:36:17,877
Almost too well-endowed. You know?
I've had complaints. Literally.

1566
01:36:23,925 --> 01:36:26,010
- What are you doing?
- Packing.

1567
01:36:26,302 --> 01:36:28,971
- Let me help you with that.
- No, that's okay.

1568
01:36:29,305 --> 01:36:32,016
That's... No, really, folding!

1569
01:36:32,183 --> 01:36:34,852
No arguments.
Let somebody help you for once.

1570
01:36:38,564 --> 01:36:39,816
There you are.

1571
01:36:40,691 --> 01:36:42,318
That was unbelievable.

1572
01:36:42,485 --> 01:36:45,029
That was just amazing
That was like a movie with a stage show.

1573
01:36:45,113 --> 01:36:48,324
If you all would tour with the film,
we'd make a fortune.

1574
01:36:48,408 --> 01:36:50,952
And your sister, Kiki, she's unbelievable.

1575
01:36:51,077 --> 01:36:52,578
This is really remarkable.

1576
01:36:52,662 --> 01:36:56,916
The entire country has voted her
off the island but, no! She's back!

1577
01:36:56,999 --> 01:36:58,918
I've never seen anything like it.

1578
01:36:59,001 --> 01:37:03,089
They like the movie. The press actually likes this crazy movie!
They call it The Blair Bitch Project!

1579
01:37:03,256 --> 01:37:06,426
But the best news is you two.
Do you want to have a drink or something?

1580
01:37:06,592 --> 01:37:08,594
- We're on our way out.
- Where you going?

1581
01:37:08,678 --> 01:37:09,762
We don't know.
Isn't that great?

1582
01:37:09,887 --> 01:37:13,808
Once in a while, good things happen.
All right, I'll see you.

1583
01:37:13,891 --> 01:37:17,019
There's a car waiting,
you won't have to deal with the press.

1584
01:37:17,103 --> 01:37:19,105
But I'll need you! We got a lot to do!

1585
01:37:19,188 --> 01:37:20,898
This one's going to work!

1586
01:37:40,585 --> 01:37:41,753
Hi.

1587
01:37:42,045 --> 01:37:44,130
Can I explain why I didn't call?
