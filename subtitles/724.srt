00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:02,199
FARELL: Left! Left! Left!

528
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,079
- What are you? Sound off!
- ALL: I'm a warrior!

529
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,999
- What do warriors do?
- ALL: Kill!

530
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,399
- FARELL: What are you gonna do?
- ALL: Kill!

531
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,999
- FARELL: What are you gonna do?
- ALL: Kill!

532
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,199
FORD: It's gonna be my
20th battle tomorrow.

533
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,799
- You haven't been in 20 battles, mate.
- I have too.

534
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,759
You're gonna dump your load
the second we hit the beach.

535
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,439
Why don't you get yourselves
a cup of shut-the-hell-up?

536
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,999
FORD: Ha-ha. You funny, girl.

537
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,719
I bet I set a record tomorrow.

538
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:29,047
Fastest time running backwards,
Ford, slipping in your own shit.

539
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,799
Knock off the grab-ass!

540
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,959
Grab this, sarge!

541
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,761
Hold up!

542
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,761
Private, drop and give me...

543
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,641
Fifty, sarge?

544
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,919
That's right.

545
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,599
Fifty.

546
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,208
Platoon!

547
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,122
Drop and give me 50!

548
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,319
Compliments of Private Cage.

549
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,559
CAGE: Thank you, sarge.

550
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,439
- FARELL: And one!
- ALL: One!

551
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,679
- FARELL: And two!
- ALL: Two!

552
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,481
- FARELL: And three!
- ALL: Three!

553
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,369
- CAGE: Aah!
- Oh!

554
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,599
What the hell were you thinking?

555
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:15,239
FARELL: There's hope for you, private.
Hope in the form of glorious combat.

556
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,999
Battle is the great redeemer.

557
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,759
- FARELL: Three!
- ALL: Three!

558
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,399
- FARELL: Four!
- ALL: Four!

559
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,725
- FARELL: Five!
- ALL: Five!

560
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,286
CAGE: Excuse me. Sergeant Vrataski.

561
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,208
Excuse me.

562
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,525
Sergeant Vrataski?

563
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,522
[ALARM SOUNDING]

564
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,559
Excuse me.

565
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,771
Yes? Who said you could talk to me?

566
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,919
Have I got something on my face?

567
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,799
You did. You did.

568
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,839
Tomorrow. At the beach.

569
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,404
Tomorrow. At the beach.

570
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,762
We meet.

571
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:54,371
You said to find you when I wake up.

572
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,159
You do know what's happening to me.

573
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,199
Come with me.

574
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,679
Now.

575
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,639
You don't talk to anyone
about this but me.

576
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,759
The best-case scenario is you're
gonna end up in a psych ward.

577
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:12,239
Worst case, you'll get dissected
for study. Are we clear?

578
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,679
- Yes?
- Yes.

579
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,599
First time you died, what happened?

580
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,159
- You killed a mimic?
- Yes.

581
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,879
- Describe it.
- It was different.

582
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,879
It was bigger. Bluish.

583
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,639
And you got covered in its blood.

584
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,839
As a matter of fact, I did.

585
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,599
They know we're coming
on the beach tomorrow.

586
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,243
It's a slaughter, isn't it?

587
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,039
How do you know this?

588
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,639
Could you just...? Wait!

589
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,119
Wait. Wait.

590
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:43,239
Would you explain to me
what the hell is happening.

591
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,679
What happened to you happened to me.

592
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,079
I had it. I lost it. Okay?

593
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,839
That's great. There's a cure.
How do I get rid of this?

594
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,479
First, I need your help.

595
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,601
Help with what exactly?

596
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,919
Winning the war.

597
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,960
Let's go! Come on!

598
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,399
CARTER: Rita, what is this?

599
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,199
What are you doing here?
You gotta give me some warning.

600
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,479
- Who's this?
- He's me. Before Verdun.

601
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,725
He's gonna help us.

602
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,119
What? You mean he's...?

603
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,921
Yes.

604
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,959
When did he die? Where?

605
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,727
On the beach. Tomorrow.

606
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,959
How many fingers am I
holding up behind my back?

607
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,091
How should I know that?

608
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,719
CARTER: Okay.

609
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,719
So this is the first time
we've had this conversation.

610
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,159
- You should try this on him.
- What is that?

611
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,291
It doesn't work.

612
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,119
Has he had any visions yet?

613
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,319
Visions of what?

614
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,519
There's still time.

615
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,479
- Yes.
- Time? Look, I'm sorry.

616
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,964
Who is this? Who are you?

617
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,089
I'm Dr. Carter. Particle physics.
Advanced microbiology.

618
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:31,639
He's also the only other person who'll
believe what's happening to you.

619
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,919
No one understands mimic
biology better than him.

620
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,719
He's a top analyst at Whitehall.

621
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:39,079
Well, I mean, I was until I
met Rita and now I'm just...

622
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,439
a "mechanic with
psychiatric delusions."

623
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,639
Carter.

624
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,519
Show him.

625
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,606
Yeah, right.

626
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,719
Right. Well, first of all...

627
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,999
you're not fighting an army.

628
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,999
You have to think of this
as a single organism.

629
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,039
Now, these common drones,
they act like its claws.

630
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:07,079
And Alphas, like the one that
you killed, are much more rare.

631
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,479
CARTER: Yeah. They're like one in...

632
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,159
- ...6.18 million, by my guess.
- RITA: Yes.

633
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,879
They act as the enemy's...

634
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,639
They're like its central
nervous system.

635
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,439
But this...

636
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,479
is the brain.

637
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:21,679
It controls them all.
And this is the Omega.

638
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:26,099
And the Omega has the
ability to control time.

639
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,799
Whenever an Alpha is killed...

640
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,519
an automatic response is triggered.

641
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,319
The Omega starts the day over again.

642
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:39,519
But you see, this time, it can remember
what's going to happen just like you do.

643
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,759
CARTER: It knows exactly what we're
gonna do before we're gonna do it.

644
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,211
- And an enemy that knows the future can't lose.
- It can't lose.

645
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,399
But if that's true, how
did you win at Verdun?

646
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,559
We were allowed to win.

647
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,599
This thing wants us to
believe we can win.

648
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,919
It wants us to throw everything
we have into the invasion.

649
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:03,919
Operation Downfall isn't our
endgame it's the enemy's.

650
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,399
CARTER: The thing you've got to understand
is this is a perfectly evolved...

651
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,487
world-conquering organism.

652
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,679
For all we know, there are
millions of those asteroids...

653
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:17,639
floating around in the
cosmos like a virus.

654
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:21,599
They're just waiting to crash-land into
a world with just the right conditions.

655
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:25,802
All they need is for the dominant
life form to attack and:

656
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,719
RITA: There'll be nothing
to stop the mimics...

657
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:30,159
from conquering the
rest of the world.

658
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,962
Unless you change the outcome.

659
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,039
Me?

660
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,959
When you killed that Alpha, you inadvertently
entered the enemy's nervous system.

661
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:43,486
Cage, you've seized control of the
Omega's ability to reset the day.

662
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,759
- How's that even possible?
- CARTER: Perhaps this organism's...

663
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,879
only vulnerability,
its only vulnerability...

664
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,119
is humanity.

665
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,959
Regardless of that,
you control the power now.

666
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,679
Just as I did in Verdun.

667
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,720
So I'm resetting the day?

668
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,686
Okay.

669
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,601
How do I control it?

670
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,519
You have to die.

671
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,039
Every day.

672
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,842
Until the Omega's destroyed.

673
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,479
First of all...

674
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,679
this is a terrific presentation.

675
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:33,005
Terrific.

676
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,959
I know the general.

677
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,489
We should take this to him.

678
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:41,608
- You just tell him everything you told me.
- I went to see the general.

679
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,283
Any number of times.

680
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:48,084
Psych ward. Dissection. Remember?

681
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,646
What are you expecting from me?

682
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,204
Have you seen anything strange?

683
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,199
Is he shitting me?

684
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,279
Visions.

685
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,287
Visions. Have you seen
any visions like that?

686
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,932
The Omega senses when it's
losing control of its power.

687
00:45:07,933 --> 00:45:10,319
Even now it's mentally
searching to find you.

688
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,970
RITA: When it's close to finding
you you will start having visions.

689
00:45:13,971 --> 00:45:18,487
- You'll start to see that.
- You'll even see where it is.

690
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,279
And you had these visions?

691
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,206
Yes.

692
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,679
But eventually you saw it.
I mean, you actually saw it.

693
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,606
Right?

694
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,247
Never in the flesh.

695
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,242
So this is all just some...

696
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,359
theory.

697
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:46,159
You don't know if this
thing even exists.

698
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:50,521
The visions showed me it was
at Verdun. I could see it. I...

699
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,159
I just...

700
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,361
lost the power before
