will allow.

00:09:56,257 --> 00:10:00,594
he can never, ever
replace...

180
00:10:00,636 --> 00:10:02,221
me.

181
00:10:02,304 --> 00:10:03,430
Pow.

182
00:10:03,514 --> 00:10:04,556
Not yet, but I think

183
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,933
that new upgrade
comes in next week.

184
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:14,023
[ Chuckles ]
Only joking.

185
00:10:14,107 --> 00:10:15,817
Hey!

186
00:10:17,943 --> 00:10:19,653
Kids. Kids. Kids. Kids.

187
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:21,822
Ki--

188
00:10:21,905 --> 00:10:24,199
Joking?

189
00:10:25,534 --> 00:10:26,702
Thank you.

190
00:10:26,785 --> 00:10:28,036
Yes, ma'am.

191
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:29,287
Okay. Remember, kids,

192
00:10:29,371 --> 00:10:32,040
this is a very important night
for your father.

193
00:10:32,123 --> 00:10:34,751
And if he's named director
of the O.S.S.,

194
00:10:34,792 --> 00:10:37,211
be sure to stand up
and give him a big hug,

195
00:10:37,295 --> 00:10:38,587
all right?

196
00:10:38,629 --> 00:10:40,756
What if Dad doesn't win?

197
00:10:40,798 --> 00:10:43,967
Well, then,
give him a bigger hug.

198
00:10:48,263 --> 00:10:49,639
Oh, Yao Ling, Wa Ling,

199
00:10:49,681 --> 00:10:51,641
this is Danielle
and Dione Daluc.

200
00:10:51,724 --> 00:10:52,976
-- Hello.
-- Hi.

201
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:56,312
They created lnfolink, sort of
an online trading system

202
00:10:56,395 --> 00:10:58,647
for swapping
international secrets.

203
00:11:01,525 --> 00:11:03,110
Hi.

204
00:11:03,193 --> 00:11:04,778
Oh, hey.

205
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,154
Hello.

206
00:11:06,196 --> 00:11:07,072
Champagne?

207
00:11:07,155 --> 00:11:08,198
Can't have any of that.

208
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:09,949
Sorry.

209
00:11:11,951 --> 00:11:14,954
Something doesn't feel right.

210
00:11:14,996 --> 00:11:16,706
No wonder --
your buddy's here --

211
00:11:16,789 --> 00:11:18,499
your buddy
with the weird laugh.

212
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:19,750
He does not have
a weird laugh.

213
00:11:19,834 --> 00:11:23,128
We were just...
talking about you.

214
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:24,129
Really?

215
00:11:26,506 --> 00:11:28,466
Wow.
You look great, Carmen.

216
00:11:28,508 --> 00:11:30,885
-- You want to dance?
-- Sure.

217
00:11:30,969 --> 00:11:33,346
I don't think that's
a good idea, Gary.

218
00:11:33,388 --> 00:11:36,098
Family rules say you need to
ask my father's permission.

219
00:11:36,182 --> 00:11:38,893
You know, you should have had
that suit tailored, Juni.

220
00:11:38,976 --> 00:11:40,644
It's bunching up
around your gut,

221
00:11:40,686 --> 00:11:42,438
and it makes your head
look way too big.

222
00:11:42,521 --> 00:11:45,357
You have to excuse
my little brother.

223
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:48,652
He's still a little upset
about the...Juggler incident.

224
00:11:48,693 --> 00:11:50,236
A good agent
controls his temper.

225
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,324
Just be glad
my dad isn't here.

226
00:11:55,366 --> 00:11:57,618
He gets really psycho
about this sort of thing.

227
00:11:58,828 --> 00:12:00,538
Hi, Dad.

228
00:12:00,621 --> 00:12:02,664
Um, you remember Gary.
He's in our organization.

229
00:12:02,706 --> 00:12:05,083
I was just asking your daughter
for a dance.

230
00:12:05,167 --> 00:12:06,668
You know how to dance?

231
00:12:06,752 --> 00:12:07,794
Fairly well, sir.

232
00:12:07,878 --> 00:12:08,962
What kind of dances?

233
00:12:09,045 --> 00:12:10,255
All types of dances.

234
00:12:10,338 --> 00:12:11,673
-- What about tango?
-- Yes.

235
00:12:11,714 --> 00:12:12,840
-- Mambo?
-- Fairly well.

236
00:12:12,924 --> 00:12:14,092
-- Rumba?
-- Yes.

237
00:12:14,175 --> 00:12:15,259
-- Cha-cha-cha?
-- Seven steps.

238
00:12:15,343 --> 00:12:16,344
-- Bossa nova?
-- Mm-hmm.

239
00:12:16,385 --> 00:12:17,511
-- Merengue?
-- Of course.

240
00:12:22,891 --> 00:12:24,184
What about waltz?

241
00:12:24,226 --> 00:12:27,229
Y-Yeah, I can waltz.

242
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,688
Show me.

243
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:33,192
Right.

244
00:12:40,032 --> 00:12:41,408
Something like that.

245
00:12:42,785 --> 00:12:45,203
All right.

246
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:47,038
You can go to dance.

247
00:12:51,751 --> 00:12:54,379
Watch your older sister.

248
00:13:15,731 --> 00:13:16,732
Alexandra?

249
00:13:16,774 --> 00:13:17,733
Yes?

250
00:13:17,775 --> 00:13:19,401
What are you doing in there?

251
00:13:19,485 --> 00:13:21,195
Dancing.

252
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:24,114
Do you always carry
this many Secret Service around?

253
00:13:24,198 --> 00:13:25,991
My dad's idea --

254
00:13:26,074 --> 00:13:29,536
he's gotten
a little...paranoid.

255
00:13:29,619 --> 00:13:34,040
Well, would you dance...
with me?

256
00:13:34,123 --> 00:13:35,416
No.

257
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:38,836
All right,
hold on a second, guys.

258
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,421
Level 2 -- break it up!

259
00:13:43,424 --> 00:13:45,092
Why not.

260
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,179
I only dance...

261
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:50,680
ballet.

262
00:13:51,973 --> 00:13:56,018
What
an incredible coincidence.

263
00:13:57,812 --> 00:13:59,438
So do l.

264
00:14:29,007 --> 00:14:30,592
Well, Juni, I must say,

265
00:14:30,675 --> 00:14:32,802
you're a man
of many talents.

266
00:14:38,099 --> 00:14:39,642
One tries.

267
00:14:42,478 --> 00:14:45,772
Uh, could you find your seats?
We're ready to start.

268
00:14:48,984 --> 00:14:51,069
I must go.

269
00:14:57,033 --> 00:14:58,284
-- [ Shuffling ]
-- Man: Ladies and gentlemen,

270
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:00,411
the president
of the United States.

271
00:15:05,082 --> 00:15:06,166
Thank you.

272
00:15:09,169 --> 00:15:10,337
I am proud of the O.S.S.

273
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,630
and their newly formed
Spy Kids division.

274
00:15:12,714 --> 00:15:15,466
For their outstanding
accomplishments yesterday.

275
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,677
Gary and Gerti Giggles

276
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,261
not only saved
my daughter...

277
00:15:19,345 --> 00:15:22,014
What is he talking about?!
I saved her!

278
00:15:22,056 --> 00:15:23,307
Juni...

279
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,852
But more importantly,
if not most importantly,

280
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:30,188
they safely retrieved
the Transmooker device

281
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,815
that my daughter accidentally
took from my office

282
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:33,983
earlier that day.

283
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,486
Now it is my great pleasure
to announce

284
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,030
the new director
of the O.S.S....

285
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:43,617
Gregor--

286
00:15:47,245 --> 00:15:48,830
...Donnagon Giggles.

287
00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:00,216
Gary and Gerti Giggles

288
00:16:00,257 --> 00:16:01,759
are the kind of agents
we need

289
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,344
to turn the O.S.S. around.

290
00:16:04,428 --> 00:16:06,722
I am proud to award them

291
00:16:06,763 --> 00:16:10,558
-- these Level 1 badges,

292
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,812
-- What?
-- which will enable them
to take on real missions,

293
00:16:14,896 --> 00:16:17,732
something challenging,
like the Ukata assignment.

294
00:16:17,773 --> 00:16:19,233
Yes!

295
00:16:19,275 --> 00:16:22,611
- I wanted that assignment.
This is so unfair.

296
00:16:22,653 --> 00:16:24,988
I am proud to claim them

297
00:16:25,072 --> 00:16:28,366
as our organization's
top Spy Kid operatives!

298
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,701
Something's not right.

299
00:16:29,784 --> 00:16:31,077
And I'm also proud

300
00:16:31,119 --> 00:16:34,080
to claim them, of course,

301
00:16:34,122 --> 00:16:36,082
as my children.

302
00:16:36,123 --> 00:16:37,375
This is all wrong.

303
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,668
To our Spy Kids.

304
00:16:39,752 --> 00:16:41,420
-- To our Spy Kids.
-- To our Spy Kids.
-- To our Spy Kids.

305
00:16:41,462 --> 00:16:43,046
To our Spy Kids.

306
00:16:56,142 --> 00:16:57,643
This -- ugh! Ohh.

307
00:17:08,904 --> 00:17:10,280
Boy: Secure the perimeter!

308
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:12,949
Sleepers.

309
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:16,786
They're after
the Transmooker device!

310
00:17:33,968 --> 00:17:34,927
Take 'em down.

311
00:17:44,311 --> 00:17:45,312
-- Pull!
-- Pull!

312
00:18:32,147 --> 00:18:33,147
Eeyah!

313
00:18:38,402 --> 00:18:40,112
Get off, squirt.

314
00:18:40,196 --> 00:18:41,363
Ugh!

315
00:18:44,908 --> 00:18:46,952
Give me that back!

316
00:20:08,818 --> 00:20:10,070
-- You all right, sir?
-- Yeah.

317
00:20:14,157 --> 00:20:15,658
Come here!

318
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,034
Juni, get off of him!

319
00:20:23,332 --> 00:20:25,459
No, no. They took
the Transmooker device!

320
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,378
They took
the Transmooker device!

321
00:20:52,025 --> 00:20:55,027
The following
Spy Kid cadets

322
00:20:55,111 --> 00:20:57,780
please report to the psychic
abilities seminar --

323
00:20:57,863 --> 00:21:00,282
- Mike Cardenas
and Daniel Duluth.

324
00:21:04,036 --> 00:21:05,912
-- It's my turn, too.
-- Are you sure?

325
00:21:05,996 --> 00:21:08,206
All right, your last name is?

326
00:21:12,877 --> 00:21:14,712
Hold on a second.

327
00:21:14,754 --> 00:21:16,672
I had the Transmooker
in my hand,

328
00:21:16,714 --> 00:21:17,840
but you know Juni --

329
00:21:17,882 --> 00:21:19,884
he wanted to claim it
for himself.

330
00:21:19,925 --> 00:21:22,469
-- Okay, that should do it.
Thank you, son.
-- Right.

331
00:21:22,553 --> 00:21:26,306
If that Transmooker device
falls into the wrong hands...

332
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,849
we're doomed.

333
00:21:27,933 --> 00:21:30,226
Thank you, Mr. President.
That'll be all.

334
00:21:30,268 --> 00:21:31,728
[ Echoing ] We're doomed!

335
00:21:31,769 --> 00:21:33,938
Understood, sir.

336
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,043
Here.

337
00:22:11,222 --> 00:22:13,891
Man: "Floop's Fooglie"...

338
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:16,936
Starring Minion...

339
00:22:16,978 --> 00:22:19,355
and Carmenita...

340
00:22:23,817 --> 00:22:25,611
Thanks.

341
00:22:34,827 --> 00:22:37,288
I was fired.

342
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:38,664
I know.

343
00:22:38,748 --> 00:22:41,250
I hacked
into the O.S.S. data files

344
00:22:41,292 --> 00:22:43,335
and saw the news.

345
00:22:43,418 --> 00:22:45,545
It was probably my fault,
I suppose.

346
00:22:45,629 --> 00:22:47,756
[ Sighs ] I'm sorry.

347
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:50,091
Well, I guess that's that.

348
00:22:50,133 --> 00:22:53,011
Let's go to the tree house.
I got an idea.

349
00:22:56,305 --> 00:22:57,765
I guess
I could always set up

350
00:22:57,807 --> 00:23:01,226
a small detective agency
out here or something.

351
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:03,604
[ Sighs ] You're thinking
small again, Juni.

352
00:23:03,645 --> 00:23:05,981
The old tree house --

353
00:23:06,023 --> 00:23:08,525
needs
another helicopter pad.

354
00:23:08,608 --> 00:23:10,777
It needs a paint job,
is what it needs.

355
00:23:20,828 --> 00:23:22,788
Woman: Your name?

356
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:26,083
Carmen Elizabeth Juanita
Echo Sky Brava Cortez.

357
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:27,584
-- [ Beeping ]
-- Woman: Your name?

358
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:30,545
Juni Rocket Racer
Rebelde Cortez.

359
00:23:39,178 --> 00:23:40,387
You know...

360
00:23:40,471 --> 00:23:43,223
I'm kind of looking forward
to retirement,

361
00:23:43,307 --> 00:23:47,811

and dreams I left behind.

362
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:50,438
Oh, stop it, Juni.

363
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:56,068
Look, do you want
your job back or not?

364
00:23:56,152 --> 00:23:58,446
That's right --
reinstated Level 2.

365
00:23:58,529 --> 00:24:01,448
So now we can get back
the missing Transmooker.

366
00:24:01,532 --> 00:24:02,616
How?

367
00:24:15,169 --> 00:24:18,089
Looks like Gary and Gerti
are about to get briefed

368
00:24:18,172 --> 00:24:19,632
on the Ukata assignment.

369
00:24:19,715 --> 00:24:21,592
We should listen in.

370
00:24:23,719 --> 00:24:25,846
Is R.A.L.P.H. still
at your office?

371
00:24:25,887 --> 00:24:28,974

cleaned it out yet.

372
00:24:39,066 --> 00:24:41,694
R.A.L.P.H.,
get to the briefing room.

373
00:24:41,735 --> 00:24:45,197
We need you to spy
on Gary and Gerti.

374
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,616
Make sure no one sees you.

375
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:29,571
- Donnagon: There is
a Bermuda Triangle of sorts

376
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:30,947
off the coast
of Madagascar.

377
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:32,782
As you may remember,
this is an area

378
00:25:32,824 --> 00:25:36,077
where some of our O.S.S. cargo
ships have been disappearing.

379
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:37,453
Good boy, R.A.L.P.H.

380
00:25:37,495 --> 00:25:39,080
The survivors
of these disappearances

381
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:41,749
tell delusional tales

382
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:45,043
of a mysterious island
populated by strange creatures.

383
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:48,672
Obviously, no land mass
is located anywhere near there,

384
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:51,925
-- so these tales were
dismissed, and the agents fired.

385
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,343
However...

386
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:56,053
the magnet ship that captured
the Transmooker device

387
00:25:56,137 --> 00:26:00,015
was last seen
in this same area.

388
00:26:00,099 --> 00:26:01,975
So, we need a small ship,

389
00:26:02,017 --> 00:26:04,228
piloted by two small agents

390
00:26:04,311 --> 00:26:06,188
to go in and take
a closer look.

391
00:26:06,271 --> 00:26:09,232

out of the ordinary,

393
00:26:10,942 --> 00:26:12,735

395
00:26:14,195 --> 00:26:15,404

Come home, R.A.L.P.H.
Good work.

397

It's a great assignment,

398
00:26:21,118 --> 00:26:23,871
but Gary and Gerti have it,
and I'm fired.
