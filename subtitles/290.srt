Iko

32
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,937
I spoke to Mr. Babbitt
on that just this morning.

33
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,648
I'm still sitting
on four Lamborghinis

34
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,150
that can't make
the smog emission standards.

35
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,444
Now, how many times
you wash out with EPA?

36
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,697
Yes, they're finally clearing
EPA. Just one or two more days.

37
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:21,200
Three times? We're really
on a roll here, my friend.

38
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,869
Four cars, three times each.
That's zip for 12.

39
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,579
What are you? A mechanic
or a NASA engineer?

40
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:28,707
Now, listen. I told you I've never
dealt with these Lamborghinis before,

41
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,793
and yet you assured me that you could
deliver these cars within that time frame.

42
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:34,504
Don't tell me that, 'cause
I'm not even listening.

43
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,715
Well, sir, I hardly
think that's necessary.

44
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,426
Well, I'll explain that to my swing
loan. I'm sure he'll be very sympathetic.

45
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,387
I'm into him for 200,000. That's
thousand, my friend, three zeros.

46
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,847
I got all my money
tied up in these cars,

47
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,098
and if I don't
get my money out,

48
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,559
I am over, I am finished.
Do you understand that?

49
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,519
You have to understand
our situation here.

50
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:52,439
I don't give a shit about your problems.
I got a shark snapping at my heels here.

51
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,858
They could've taken the car
and my business 11 days ago.

52
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,068
They're collateral,
for Christ's sake.

53
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,486
Got to hold 'em off
with a whip and a chair here.

54
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,239
I understand that, I know
delivery is way overdue.

55
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,823
Fuckin' EPA...

56
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,242
Whole world is
choking on smog,

57
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,368
and they're gonna
correct the situation

58
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:05,911
by keeping my four cars
off the road?

59
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,456
Babbitt Collectibles.

60
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,584
Have you tried cash? How much can
one of these EPA guys earn in a week?

61
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,127
Charlie, it's Wyatt.

62
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,629
Wyatt?
Yeah.

63
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:16,755
About the swing loan.

64
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,465
If he doesn't
get the money by 5:30,

65
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,259
he's gonna come
and seize all the cars.

66
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,593
I'm gonna have to
call you back.

67
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,428
I really think you should
talk to Mr. Babbitt on this.

68
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,430
Tell him that you don't understand.
I signed a check on Tuesday,

69
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,350
you personally watched me sign it,
and then you gave it to the mail girl.

70
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,559
Come on! I need this!

71
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:30,686
Come on!

72
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:33,689
I wouldn't do that, sir, until
you talk to Mr. Babbitt personally.

73
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,400
A number for him?
No, he's on the road just now.

74
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,443
He wants you to call
him immediately. Charlie.

75
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,695
Just tell him
I'm connecting to Barbados,

76
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,321
arriving 1:30 a.m.,
can he leave a number?

77
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,614
Charlie!
What, Lenny?

78
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,865
I'm standing here.
Talk to me, talk to me.

79
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,785
Mr. Bateman wants to back out on his car
and he wants to take Mr. Webb with him.

80
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,537
They want their
down payments back.

81
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,998
They found two cars at Valley
Motors, and they want to go that way.

82
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,958
Tell him that was me
on the other line,

83
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,418
that the cars
just passed emissions,

84
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,336
that the EPA paperwork
will be in here momentarily...

85
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,589
You paying attention, Lenny?
Yeah, I am, I'm listening.

86
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,842
Tell them also that I'm knocking
off five grand on both their deals

87
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:02,884
because I appreciate
their patience.

88
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,678
Now, do you understand that?
I understand that, I've got it.

89
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,221
Are you sure that you've
got that? I got it.

90
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,226
Mr. Bateman, that was
Mr. Babbitt on the other line.

91
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,229
As it happens, the cars
are passing emissions...

92
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:16,815
What am I saying? The
cars have passed emissions.

93
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:20,319
We're just waiting for the EPA
paperwork. We'll have that momentarily.

94
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,863
And because of your
incredible patience,

95
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:28,201
we're going to knock off
$5,000 on each car.

96
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,662
Well, yes,
you've been most patient.

97
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,123
We really appreciate
your patience.

98
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,000
Well, thank you.

99
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,585
Thank you.

100
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:40,797
Ready for Palm Springs?

101
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:43,175
Charlie, you still want to go
with all these problems?

102
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,303
We're seconds away from closing
this deal, clearing 75 grand.

103
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:47,888
Not bad for
a couple of phone calls, huh?

104
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,222
No, not bad at all.

105
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,807
You know where to find us,
right, Lenny?

106
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,977
Right. I got it under control.

107
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,002
Listen, I don't want
to be demanding here,

108
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:22,047
but do you think, could you possibly
say, I don't know, 10 or 12 words

109
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:23,965
before we get to the hotel?

110
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,219
Consider it foreplay.

111
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,597
Can you include me
in some of your thoughts?

112
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,183
I'm just thinking.

113
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,601
You know, nothing special.
I'm just thinking.

114
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:36,853
Maybe there's something that you're
thinking about that we can talk.

115
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,563
You know,
make a little conversation.

116
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,441
If there's something to talk about,
Susanna, we'd be talking about it.

117
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,610
I'm just thinking. What's the
big to-do about me thinking here?

118
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:44,986
I don't know, Charlie.
I just feel like

119
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:47,739
I'm going away for a
few days with someone.

120
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:48,824
Call me crazy.

121
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,534
Okay, you wanna talk,
let's talk.

122
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:51,952
How was your day?
I don't want to talk!

123
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,205
I feel like you're excluding me
from what's going on. No, let's talk!

124
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,748
It's not that
I want to talk.

125
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,001
One of these again, Susanna. How
did we get back to one of these?

126
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:03,171
I don't know why
I put up with all this.

127
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,049
You wanted to go to Palm Springs,
and we're going to Palm Springs.

128
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,759
Yes, but I didn't
want to go alone.

129
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,803
I've been sitting in this car for
more than an hour and a half...

130
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:12,013
You want to talk,
let's talk! Let's talk!

131
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,266
This is not talking,
this is you going like...

132
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:16,935
Yeah.

133
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:18,937
Charlie, this is Lenny.

134
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:21,481
I've been trying
to contact you for a while.

135
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,401
I got a long-distance call
from a Mr. Mooney,

136
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:27,195
your father's lawyer.
He's been trying to reach you.

137
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,031
Your father has died, Charlie.

138
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,534
Charlie?
Uh-huh.

139
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:35,120
I'm sorry. The funeral's
tomorrow in Cincinnati.

140
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:37,164
He said you'd know where.

141
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,748
I've got his number.

142
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,834
That's not necessary.
Anything else?

143
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:43,211
No, that's it. Listen, Charlie,
if there's anything I can do...

144
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,296
All right.
... just call...

145
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,802
Sorry about
the weekend, hon.

146
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,345
Charlie, the weekend?

147
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,974
Look, I told you before, we had
a falling out a long time ago.

148
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:58,560
My mother died when I was two.
It was just him and me.

149
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,896
We just didn't get along.

150
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,815
You're going
to the funeral, no?

151
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,900
Yeah.

152
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,234
I'm coming with you.

153
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,696
That's really sweet, but there's
really no point, you know?

154
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,364
I want to. That's the point.

155
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:15,035
All right. Sorry, I forgot
who I was talking to.

156
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,347
...for our memory, admiration

157
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,890
and respect for him

158
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,186
will live beyond the years
of his life on Earth.

159
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,523
Let us consecrate ourselves
to follow his example

160
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,316
of zest for life,

161
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,360
dedication to family,

162
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,445
and charity to all.

163
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:55,534
And now, with sure and certain
hope of resurrection, life,

164
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,454
we commend to you the soul
of our departed friend.

165
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,883
Just have to go over the details
of the will with him tonight,

166
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,134
then we're outta here.

167
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,387
Sure, I can wait
in the car if you like.

168
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:56,469
Somebody should be watering
those roses, they're all dying.

169
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:59,973
I knew this car my whole life.
Only drove it once.

170
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:03,101
It's a 1949 Buick Roadmaster
convertible.

171
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:06,771
Only 8,000 production models
made. Straight-8. Fireball-8.

172
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:10,358
It was the first full year
of the Dynaflow transmission.

173
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,069
I know it by rote.

174
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,046
You were his only child.

175
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:35,925
You came along when he was,
what, 45 or something?

176
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,512
Probably thought he was
never going to have a son.

177
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,139
So he had to love you.

178
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,308
I think you're exaggerating.

179
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:46,102
You were his child,
his son, his blood.

180
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,938
Anyway, in these pictures
here, he doesn't look like a man

181
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,940
who doesn't love his child. What
are you doing looking at this?

182
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:51,983
Put that away.
No.

183
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,109
Put that away.

184
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,654
You wanna hear a story? I'll tell
you one story. But don't get mad.

185
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,405
I'm just saying. You know
the convertible in the garage?

186
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,199
His baby.
That and the goddamn roses.

187
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,283
Buick.

188
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,745
The car was off-limits to me.
"That's a classic," he'd say.

189
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,789
"It commands respect.
It's not for children. "

190
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:08,124
Tenth grade, I'm 16 years old,
and for once,

191
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,960
I bring home a report card
and it's almost all A's.

192
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:14,214
I go to my old man,
"Can I take the car out?"

193
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,133
Take the guys out in the
Buick, sort of a victory drive.

194
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,760
He says no.

195
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,054
I take it anyway. I steal
the keys, I sneak it out.

196
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,681
You took the car
with no permission?

197
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,058
Yes.
Why? Why then?

198
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,894
Because I deserved it.

199
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,271
Nothing I did was
good enough for this guy.

200
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,356
Don't you understand that?

201
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,150
We're on
Columbia Parkway, four kids.

202
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,569
We get pulled over.
An accident?

203
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,321
Pulled over.

204
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:40,573
What is pulled over? Police?

205
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:41,783
Yes, police.

206
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,744
Can I finish?
Yes.

207
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,496
He called in a report
of a stolen car,

208
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,040
not his son took the car
without permission,

209
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,750
just stolen.

210
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,211
Central station, the other guys'
dads bail them out in an hour,

211
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:54,796
he left me there two days.

212
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,631
He left you in prison
for two days?

213
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:57,716
Two days.

214
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:00,677
Were you scared?

215
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,221
Yeah, I was scared.

216
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,434
Left home.
I never saw him again.

217
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,186
Charlie, after a year
we've been together,

218
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,647
this is the first time
I've heard this story.

219
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,482
It's strange, no?

220
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:18,111
I mean, how can you keep all this
inside you and not say anything?

221
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:20,155
When I was a kid
and I got scared,

222
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,365
the Rain Man would come
and sing to me.

223
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:25,827
Rain what?

224
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,456
You know, one of those
imaginary childhood friends.

225
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,167
What happened to him?

226
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,169
Nothing.
I just grew up.

227
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:36,921
Not so much.

228
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,259
"And I remember,
too, the day you left home,

229
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,179
"so full of bitterness
and grandiose ideas,

230
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:46,389
"so full of yourself.

231
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,932
"And being raised
without a mother,

232
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,769
"the hardness of your heart
is understandable, as well.

233
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:55,106
"Your refusal to even pretend
that you loved or respected me,

234
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,816
"all these I forgive.

235
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,235
"But your failure to write,
to telephone,

236
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,112
"to reenter my life
in any way,

237
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,989
"has left me
without a son.

238
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,116
"I wish you all
I ever wanted for you.

239
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,910
"I wish you the best. "

240
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:16,336
"I hereby bequeath to my son,
Charles Sanford Babbitt,

241
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,505
"that certain
Buick convertible,

242
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:22,926
"the very car that, unfortunately,
brought our relationship to an end.

243
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:27,138
"Also, outright title to my
prize-winning hybrid rosebushes.

244
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,432
"May they remind him
of the value of excellence

245
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,643
"and the possibility
of perfection.

246
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:34,604
"As for my home and all other
property, real and personal,

247
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,689
"these shall be
placed in trust

248
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,983
"in accordance with the terms
of that certain instrument

249
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,402
"executed concurrently
herewith. "

250
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,987
The last part,
what does that mean?

251
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,447
It means that the estate,

252
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:49,369
in excess of $3 million
after expenses and taxes,

253
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,246
will go into a trust fund

254
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,706
for a beneficiary
to be named in this document.

255
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,250
Who is that?

256
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,126
I'm afraid I can't
tell you that.

257
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,711
Who controls the money? You?
You control the money?

258
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,380
No, it's called a trustee.

259
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,799
What is that? How does that
work? How does that work?

260
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:06,094
Forgive me, but there's
nothing more I can say.

261
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:09,681
Now, I'm sorry, son. I can
see that you're disappointed.

262
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,266
Disappointed?
Why should I be disappointed?

263
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,810
I got rosebushes, didn't I?
I got a used car, didn't I?

264
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,812
What's-his-name got...
What'd you call him?

265
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,648
Beneficiary. Right,
beneficiary. He got $3 million.

266
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,650
But he didn't get the
rosebushes. I got the rosebushes.

267
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:21,985
I definitely got
the rosebushes.

268
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,945
Charles... I definitely
got the rosebushes.

269
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,738
I mean, those are rosebushes.
There is no need...

270
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,323
To what?

271
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,950
To be upset?

272
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:30,785
To be upset?

273
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,122
If there is a hell, sir,

274
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,708
my father is in it,
and he is looking up right now

275
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:39,210
and he is laughing
his ass off.

276
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:42,005
Sanford Babbitt, you want to be
that guy's son for five minutes?

277
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,673
Did you hear that letter?
Were you listening?

278
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:46,676
Yes, sir, I was.
Were you?

279
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,598
No. Could you repeat it? I
can't believe my fuckin' ears.

280
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,145
I was looking for you.

281
00:14:58,522 --> 00:14:59,856
How did it go?

282
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,942
I got what I expected.

283
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,920
Susanna, this could take
a few minutes.

284
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,563
Can I help you?

285
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:41,856
Yes, I think you can.

286
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,651
I have a problem
with a private trust...

287
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,403
That's a terrific suit.
Thank you.

288
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,405
My father was
Sanford Babbitt...

289
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:00,166
Is this Wallbrook?

290
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,669
Excuse me.
Is this Wallbrook?

291
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,212
Excuse me.

292
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,805
Dr. Bruner is
still in conference.

293
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,348
Would you like to wait
in his outer office?

294
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,725
No, we'll stay here.
Thank you.

295
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,535
Maybe we're not supposed
to be looking around here, no?

296
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,430
Good to have you here.
Good luck to all three of you.

297
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,599
$20 starts you all off on a very
important match, starts with this.

298
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:02,687
In what 1980 comedy film did Goldie
Hawn get away from it all? Lisa?

299
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:03,813
Lisa?
Private Benjamin.

300
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:07,150
Excuse me, please. I want
to watch the TV, please.

301
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,153
For whose grandson

302
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:13,031
was the presidential retreat
Camp David named? Lisa?

303
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,533
Eisenhower. That's right.
For David Eisenhower.

304
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:18,369
You've got another five.
$10 lead for Lisa.

305
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:22,707
In days of yore, what would a
swashbuckler keep in his sheath?

306
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,736
Whatever this is, I don't
understand the point of secrecy.

307
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,113
This patient is an old
girlfriend of my father's?

308
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,908
Mr. Babbitt, I knew your father
since you were two years old.

309
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:58,201
The year my mother died.

310
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,744
Look, I'm trustee
of the fund,

311
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,412
but this hospital
receives nothing from that.

312
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:04,248
That hardly seems fair. Maybe that's
something that we could discuss.

313
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:06,751
I took on this burden
out of loyalty to your father.

314
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,336
That's where my loyalty ends.

315
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,546
And you think I should feel
a little of that loyalty?

316
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:13,091
I think you feel cheated
out of your birthright

317
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:16,469
by a man who had
difficulty showing love.

318
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:19,764
And I think if I were in your
shoes, I'd probably feel the same.

319
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,265
I was hoping
that we could talk,

320
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,975
that you would explain
my father's side of it,

321
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,685
help me understand
the right in what he's done,

322
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,688
because, failing that, I have
responsibilities of my own,

323
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,566
and they have to be met,
even if that means a fight.

324
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,444
Sorry, this is not
your car. It's my boyfriend's.

325
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,822
Yeah, my dad lets
me drive slow on the driveway.

326
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,240
I'm an excellent driver.

327
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,783
Are you sure
that you drive this car?

328
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:42,912
There's only 28 miles on the odometer
since I drove it a week ago, last Saturday.

329
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,580
Should be more
than 28 miles.

330
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:46,415
Look, my boyfriend
is coming.

331
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,959
Course, today's Monday.

332
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:51,087
I always drive the car on
Saturday, never drive on Monday.

333
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,255
What is this?
Who is this guy?

334
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,798
I don't know,
he jumped into the car.

335
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,216
Well, he can jump out.

336
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,384
I'm an excellent driver.

337
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,052
That's good.
Come on, come on.

338
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,265
Why did you let him get in
this car? It's not a toy.

339
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,308
He says he...
He says he drives this car.

340
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,561
Dad lets me drive slow on
the driveway every Saturday.

341
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:10,898
Course, the seats were originally
brown leather, now they're pitiful red.

342
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,568
You know, these seats
were brown leather.

343
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,154
You know this car?

344
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,697
I know this car.

345
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,034
How do you know this car?

346
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,328
Definitely know this car.
It's a 1949 Buick Roadmaster.

347
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:28,583
Straight-8, Fireball-8.
Only 8,095 production models.

348
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,169
Dad lets me drive slow on the
driveway, but not on Monday.

349
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,295
Definitely not on Monday.

350
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,255
Who's your dad?
Sanford Babbitt.

351
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,673
Sanford Babbitt?

352
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:38,718
10961 Beechcrest Street,
Cincinnati, Ohio.

353
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,804
That's my address.
What is it with this guy?

354
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,389
Hey, who's your mother?

355
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:44,515
Eleanor Babbitt.

356
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,641
Eleanor?

357
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:48,227
Died January 5, 1965, after
a short and sudden illness.

358
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,353
Who the hell are you?

359
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,521
Uh-oh.
Huh?

360
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:51,939
Wait a second,
where are you going?

361
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,358
Thirteen minutes to Judge
Wapner and The People's Court.

362
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,485
Hold it, wait a second here,
I want to ask you a question.

363
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,280
"What you are witnessing
is real. The participants are not... "

364
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,865
Hey, I'm talking to you!

365
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,702
Bruner, who is this guy?

366
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,579
Raymond is your brother.

367
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,372
"... have their dispute
settled here in our forum,

368
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,457
"The People's Court. "

369
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,126
My brother?
I don't have a brother.

370
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,921
"... court cases, and have their
dispute settled here in our forum,

371
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,047
"The People's Court. "

372
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,800
"The People's Court. "

373
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,844
"The People's Court. "

374
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,973
The People's Court.

375
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,352
Hello, I'm Doug Llewelyn,

376
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,187
and welcome to
The People's Court.

377
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,731
What, is he crazy?
No.

378
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,399
Is he retarded?
Not exactly.

379
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,235
Well, he's not crazy, he's
not retarded, but he's here.

380
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,153
He's an autistic
savant.

381
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,613
I don't know
what that means.

382
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:43,115
Some people like him used
to be called idiot savants.

383
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,077
They have certain
deficiencies, certain abilities.

384
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:47,411
Yeah, but he's retarded.

385
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,872
Autistic. Actually,
high-functioning.

386
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,165
What does that mean?

387
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,085
It means that
there's a disability

388
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:57,255
that impairs the sensory input
and how it's processed.

389
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,590
English here. You're
talking over my head.

390
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,051
Raymond has a problem
communicating and learning.

391
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,302
He can't even
express himself,

392
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,012
or probably even

393
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:07,682
understand his own emotions
in a traditional way.

394
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:12,395
...and
after that, the dog bit him.

395
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,730
I yelled at my dog,
the dog laid down...

396
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,941
There are dangers
everywhere for Raymond.

397
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:20,027
Routines, rituals, it's all
he has to protect himself.

398
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,862
Rituals.
That's a good one.

399
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,366
It's the way he acts,

400
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,951
sleeps, eats,

401
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:29,704
uses the bathroom,
walks, talks, everything.

402
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,373
Any break from the routines,
and it's terrifying.

403
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:33,749
How long has he been here?

404
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,293
Well, let's see.
I came here in 1960.

405
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,044
No, how old is he?

406
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,630
He was 18 or 20 then. I'd
have to check the records...

407
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:42,258
You've been here that long?
That's when I actually started.

408
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:45,136
So that's '65, '75, '85.

409
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,138
I was almost three years old
and you knew he had a brother,

410
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,015
you knew I was his brother.

411
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,017
Yes, but what's the point?

412
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:53,102
What's the point?
What's the fuckin' point is

413
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:55,187
why didn't anybody tell me
I had a brother?

414
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,606
What would you have
done about it?

415
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,734
I don't know.

416
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:05,114
Does he know
how much money he's been left?

417
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:08,075
No, he doesn't understand
the concept of money.

418
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,996
He doesn't understand
the concept of money.

419
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,373
He's just inherited
$3 million,

420
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,293
and he doesn't understand
the concept of money?

421
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,795
That is fucking poetic,

422
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,131
don't you think?

423
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,259
Good old Dad.

424
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,636
...name's yes.
Then who's playing first? Yes.

425
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,388
I mean the fellow's name
on first base. Who.

426
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,474
The fellow playing
first base for St. Louis. Who.

427
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,143
What are you asking me for? What
is this? Why is he doing that?

428
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,312
Whenever he gets
nervous, he does "Who's on First?"

429
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,856
You know, from Abbott
and Costello. Yeah. Why?

430
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,443
Why? It's his way of dealing with you
touching things, his books and stuff.

431
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,528
So he memorized
"Who's on First?"

432
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,197
Yeah, that
among other things.

433
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:48,074
Raymond,
Ted Klus-zesski.

434
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,533
Kluszewski.
Kluszewski.

435
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:52,203
Kluszewski, Ted Kluszewski,
Big Klew, first base.

436
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,537
He played for Cincinnati?

437
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,790
Course, he was
traded for Dee Fondy, 1957.

438
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:59,043
Lifetime batting average. 298. All
these great books. He reads, huh?

439
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:01,921
Reads and remembers
whatever he gets his hands on.

440
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,883
Oh, Vern.
V- E-R-N!

441
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:08,552
Course, these people are
gonna be here all day, Vern.

442
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,638
This is an
unannounced visit, Vern.

443
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:13,724
This is definitely
not a weekend visit, Vern.

444
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,644
He's getting anxious.
It's okay, Ray! Oh, Vern!

445
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,481
This is an
unannounced visit, Vern.

446
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,316
Put it back. He said
not to touch the books.

447
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:23,567
Not to touch books.

448
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,236
You like Shakespeare, Ray?
I don't know.

449
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,196
Did you read all this?
I don't know.

450
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,572
You don't know?
Vern.

451
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:29,907
Did you read Macbeth?
I don't know. Vern.

452
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,700
You read Hamlet?
I don't know. Vern!

453
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,452
Read the Twelfth Night?
Stop it!

454
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:34,537
Yes.
Yes?

455
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:35,621
Yes.

456
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:38,249
You read all these stories
that are in this book,

457
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,708
and you don't know
if you read the book?

458
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:40,918
I don't know. V-E-R-N.

459
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:41,961
You don't know?

460
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:43,879
Maybe you better put it back.

461
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:48,426
You don't know, okay. No, Ray,
take it easy, I'm not going to...

462
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:51,470
I won't touch
anything else, Ray.

463
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,681
It's okay, Ray.
It's okay. Come on.

464
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:54,807
My main man.

465
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,892
Yeah, Vern, my main man.

466
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:58,102
My main man, Vern.

467
00:23:58,311 --> 00:23:59,854
It's okay, Ray.
Yeah.

468
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,982
My main man.
Yeah, my main man.

469
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:04,483
Here.

470
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:05,609
Here are your cards.

471
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,820
I'm sorry, I didn't know where
you want me to put them.

472
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:10,573
Are you taking
any prescription medication?

473
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:16,245
He likes you. That's just
his way of showing it.

474
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,538
Uh-oh.

475
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:19,790
When I touched him before,
he pulled away.

476
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,459
Don't take it personal.

477
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,835
He never touched me.

478
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,545
I'm closer to him
than anybody in the world.

479
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,630
Known him for nine years.

480
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,132
It's not in him.

481
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:29,800
If I left town tomorrow
and didn't say goodbye...

482
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,385
Uh-oh.
... he'd never notice.

483
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,804
He wouldn't notice
if you left?

484
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,891
I'm not sure, but I don't think
people are his first priority.

485
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,519
Hey, Ray, you want
to go take a walk?

486
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:41,896
Hmm? Ray?

487
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:44,899
Ray?

488
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:47,985
Can he hear us
when he's like that?

489
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,070
Hey, man. You wanna show
your brother your ducks?

490
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,740
Course, it's
27 minutes to Jeopardy!

491
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,826
Don't worry, Ray,
we'll bring you right back.

492
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:58,245
Practically
26 minutes to Jeopardy!

493
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,538
We'll bring him right back.

494
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:00,831
26 minutes to Jeopardy!

495
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,333
I won't do it.

496
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:03,709
I can't do it.

497
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:07,755
First of all because of your
tone of voice, this commanding...

498
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,673
You're upset.
Just calm down.

499
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,008
And second thing is because
you didn't tell me why.

500
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:13,344
Raymond, I'm gonna talk to
Susanna alone. Bye, Raymond.

501
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,847
Susanna, just hold on.
Okay? I'll be right back.

502
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:17,932
No. Just stay.

503
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,600
Just stay there.

504
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:22,520
No, Raymond. Raymond.
Raymond. Raymond!

505
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:26,941
Just stay there. Just stand
still, okay? That's good.

506
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:30,611
Okay, I'll do it if you tell
me why. Why do I do, uh...

507
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,364
What?

508
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:35,950
Why do I have to take the car
and go down there

509
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,785
and wait for you again
at the gate?

510
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,578
I've been waiting for you for days. No.

511
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,288
Why?
It's for Raymond.

512
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,123
The car disturbs him.

513
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,001
That's why?
That's why.

514
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,129
Okay, Raymond.

515
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:01,308
What are you looking at, Ray?

516
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:02,977
Ray, the ducks are over here,
what are you looking at?

517
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,228
I don't know.

518
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:10,276
Listen, our father died.

519
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,319
Did you know that he died last
week, did they tell you that?

520
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,529
I don't know.

521
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:16,824
You don't know if they told you,
or you don't know what dead is?

522
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:21,912
That means he's gone. He's not with
us anymore. He's at the cemetery.

523
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:23,581
You want to go see him
at the cemetery, Ray?

524
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:24,790
I don't know.

525
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,917
Does that mean maybe? Does
that mean maybe you wanna go?

526
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,168
I don't know.

527
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:33,007
You know,
I live in Los Angeles.

528
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:37,094
I thought maybe you'd go to Los
Angeles, like to see a Dodger game.

529
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:39,597
Go see the Dodgers play.

530
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:40,764
Today's an off day.

531
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:41,807
We don't have to go today.

532
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:43,058
Monday.
No games scheduled.

533
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:45,060
Just thought maybe you'd like
to go to Los Angeles with me,

534
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,521
you know, go see
Fernando Valenzuela pitch.

535
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,524
Fernando Valenzuela pitched Saturday.
Not scheduled to pitch till Wednesday.

536
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,651
He's gonna pitch on Wednesday?
Wednesday.

537
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,820
I'm not doing anything
on Wednesday.

538
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:55,946
Yeah, Wednesday.

539
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,031
Let's go to L.A.
Yeah.

540
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,450
Come on, Ray.

541
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:04,413
Course, it's a long way
to California.

542
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:08,000
I'm definitely not supposed to be off
the grounds for more than two hours.

543
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:09,668
Definitely have to
be back in two hours.

544
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:12,921
Wait till you get there. The people,
crowds cheering. You'll love it.

545
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,506
Have to be back in two hours.

546
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:57,401
Here's the Presidential Suite.
Dinner's at 6:30 p. m.

547
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:59,236
And to the left is
Raymond's room.

548
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,529
Look at this big,
beautiful room, huh, Ray?

549
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,906
This is not my room, this
is definitely not my room.

550
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,491
It's just for tonight, Ray.

551
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,285
Have to go back
to Wallbrook for dinner.

552
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:07,786
Little guy, little guy!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

553
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:08,912
This is gonna be terrific.

554
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,831
We're brothers. Dr. Bruner
wants us to spend time together.

555
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,207
We're gonna have some fun.

556
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,625
When did he say that?
He said that.

557
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,085
Course, I don't have
my tapioca pudding.

558
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,628
We have tapioca pudding
for dessert.

559
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:19,882
Yeah, well, we can do that. We can work
tapioca pudding, I'm gonna call Lenny.

560
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:22,676
Course, this is definitely not my room,
and I don't have my tapioca pudding,

561
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:23,761
and the bed's in
the wrong place.

562
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:24,845
That's definitely
not my bed.

563
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,138
You don't like it there,
you can move it.

564
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:29,558
Where do you want the bed,
Raymond? Should be near the window.

565
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:32,269
Course, I don't
have my books.

566
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:33,771
Course, there are
no bookshelves.

567
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:36,690
I'm definitely out of books.
I'm gonna be bookless.

568
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,192
Here's a book.

569
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,611
Big telephone book, huh?
Lot of words.

570
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:42,780
Lenny, pick up,
will you?

571
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,490
I got $200,000 about to
go in the shit house,

572
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,408
and he doesn't wanna
answer the phone.

573
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:49,161
What is it, 6:00 here? That means
it's 9:00 there, huh, Susanna?

574
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:51,538
No, it's 3:00 there.
6:30 p. m. is dinner.

575
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,790
It's 3:00 there.

576
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:55,292
It's 3:00, he doesn't
want to answer the phone?

577
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,711
Orange soda.

578
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,797
Has to be in a can with
a straw. Room temperature.

579
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:02,800
Bruner told you
that you should do this?

580
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,426
Huh?
It doesn't make sense to me.

581
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,220
I know what's good for him.

582
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:26,490
Uh-oh!

583
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:28,116
Uh-oh!
V- E-R-N!

584
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:31,036
Oh, God. Go see
what he's doing, will you?

585
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:33,539
Ray?

586
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:36,208
V- E-R-N! Home... Home...
What is it, Ray? Huh?

587
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,626
What's happening, homes?

588
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,545
Uh-oh.
It's fine, everything is fine.

589
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,338
Charlie, let's take him home.
Come on.

590
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:42,798
No, he's okay.

591
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,508
We'll just get him some
dinner, he'll be all right.

592
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:46,677
What'd you say
you wanted? Hamburger?

593
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:48,178
Hamburger, Ray?
Huh?

594
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,973
Course, we have pepperoni
pizza Monday night for dinner.

595
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:53,392
Pizza? You get pizza
in the institution?

596
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:55,769
Course, Monday night's
Italian Night.

597
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,187
Hello, offices of
Mitchell & Mitchell.

598
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,022
Yeah, get me Stu. This is
Charlie Babbitt calling.

599
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,024
I'm sorry,
he's not here.

600
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:03,819
Where is he? I got a bit
of a legal problem here.

601
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:06,071
He's out of town
until tomorrow afternoon.

602
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,115
All right,
I'll call him tomorrow.

603
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:13,912
No TV during dinnertime.
Definitely not.

604
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:16,248
Yes, but we can watch TV here.
We can. We're allowed.

605
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:17,875
Yeah.
Yeah.

606
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,838
"Wheel of Fortune!

607
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:27,217
"Look at this studio filled
with glamorous merchandise,

608
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:30,137
"fabulous and exciting

614
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:53,243
Yeah, room service, Suite 21.
I'd like to order a large pizza.

615
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,828
Pepperoni, right?

616
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,330
No, I don't want pepperoni.

617
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,332
That's right.
A large pepperoni.

618
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,500
How long's that going to take?
20 minutes.

619
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,628
Bring some beer up for two,
and orange soda.

620
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:04,296
Tapioca pudding,
you got tapioca pudding?

621
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,422
No, sir,
we don't have any.

622
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:08,508
Well, just bring the closest
thing. All right, great.

623
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,677
Here, Ray.
Yeah.

624
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,388
Take this, and food is
coming shortly. Yeah. Yeah.

625
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:15,599
And I'll be right back.
Yeah.

626
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:21,813
Course, I'm going to be here for
a long time. A very long time.

627
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,567
I'm gone for good, gone
for good from my home.

628
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,905
If I had
said anything, or did anything...

629
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,615
Get out ofhere!

630
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,076
It's all right, Susan.

631
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:13,615
J.J., it's lucky I came
right over after I got your message.

632
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,659
I got here as quickly
as I could, but...

633
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:16,868
What message?

634
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,415
What message?

635
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,584
Well, be that as it
may, someone called me...

636
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:37,139
Oh, si, si.
Si.

637
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:39,057
It's just lucky I got your
message and came over here in time.

638
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,392
Why?

639
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,441
J.J., Susie was so depressed
she tried to kill herself.

640
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,947
Ah.
Uh.

641
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,491
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

642
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:58,952
What is that?

643
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:02,205
I think Raymond is in the room. What?

644
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,373
Raymond,
are you in here?

645
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,958
Charlie, Charlie Babbitt.

646
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,169
Well, get out.

647
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:08,503
Get out!

648
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:09,880
Go!
Stop it!

649
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:11,089
Uh-oh.

650
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,801
Jesus Christ!
Stop it.

651
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:16,178
Go in there with him.

652
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:17,512
Come on, Charlie, go in there.
What?

653
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:18,722
He's your brother.
Why?

654
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:21,224
He's afraid.
He doesn't understand this.

655
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,310
Come on, go in there!

656
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,484
Raymond, what were
you doing in my room?

657
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,110
Raymond. Raymond! What
were you doing in my room?

658
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,446
I don't know. You don't know
what you were doing in my room.

659
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:35,947
Course,
there were noises.

660
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:38,033
There were noises. Well, those
noises are none of your business,

661
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:40,327
you understand that?
Huh?

662
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,954
Put the phone book down, stop acting
like an idiot, and go to sleep.

663
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,248
Hey, did you
hear what I said? Go to sleep!

664
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,416
Go to sleep!

665
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,502
Course, it's nine minutes to
11:00. Lights out at 11:00.

666
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:49,920
Yeah, well, new rules.

667
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:06,061
You don't listen to me.
You don't listen to me.

668
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:07,395
What? What are you
talking about?

669
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,274
I asked you to go there and apologize.
You went there and insulted him again!

670
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,443
What am I supposed to do, tuck
him in? I'm not his mother.

671
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,612
Charlie, you're his brother.
His brother!

672
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:18,073
They tell you today for the first
time that you have a brother,

673
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:20,951
and I don't see in your face one little
reaction. Take it easy. Take it easy.

674
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,994
I'm not saying joy,
I'm saying something.

675
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,704
Take it easy, you don't know
what I'm going through here.

676
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:25,789
No, I don't know
what you're going through.

677
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:26,873
What are you
going through?

678
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:27,958
Because I don't know.

679
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,876
Because you don't
tell me anything.

680
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,461
You just give me lies,
lies, lies.

681
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,588
Lies, lies? What lies?

682
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:37,008
The thing that Dr. Bruner asked you
to bring him here, this is bullshit.

683
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:40,220
I know it's not true. So why
don't you tell me, why is he here?

684
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:41,304
'Cause I'm pissed at him.

685
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,889
At who?
At my father.

686
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,308
You're pissed at your father,
and you bring Raymond here why?

687
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,227
I don't know why. 'Cause I
got him and they want him.

688
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,478
This makes no sense!

689
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,397
Raymond was left all the
money, and I got nothing.

690
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:53,358
How much? $3 million. The
inheritance, every penny of it.

691
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:56,403
So? So I'm gonna keep him till
I get my half! I deserve that!

692
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:00,740
What is this?

693
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,284
Huh?
Susanna?

694
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:05,453
Just take it easy here.
I've had enough.

695
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,664
What? You've had enough? What
does that mean, you've had enough?

696
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:08,874
I've just had enough,
I'm leaving.

697
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,167
You're leaving?
Yes.

698
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,793
You're leaving me now?
I need you.

699
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:14,296
I need you now.
What? You need nobody.

700
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,006
What does that mean?

701
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:19,759
What? Just take it easy.
What is my crime here?

702
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:22,762
What is my goddamn crime? Your
crime is that you use people!

703
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,015
You're using Raymond!
You're using me!

704
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:26,183
You use everybody.

705
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,434
I'm using Raymond?
Raymond!

706
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:30,145
Raymond, am I using you?
Am I using you, Raymond?

707
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,229
Yeah.
Shut up!

708
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,523
He is answering a question
from a half-hour ago!

709
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,150
What good is
$3 million to him?

710
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,903
That money is only just gonna sit
there for the rest of his life.

711
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,738
And I need that money,
you know I need that money!

712
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:42,115
Yeah, you need them, so it's
hardly like stealing, no?

713
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,992
And when it's over,
what happens to Raymond?

714
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:45,744
He'll go back to Wallbrook,
or a better place.

715
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:48,205
With the money, I
will put him in a better place.

716
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,290
What difference does it make?
He is gonna be just the same!

717
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,750
Only you have
his money, yeah!

718
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,585
His money?
That man was my father, too.

719
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:55,962
What about my fuckin' half?
Where's my fuckin' half?

720
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,214
I'm entitled to that money!

721
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,548
You've kidnapped this man!

722
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,133
I did not take him.
Yes, you did.

723
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,052
I did not take him,
I took my half.

724
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:03,428
Which half? You're crazy!

725
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:04,763
Yeah, it runs in the family.

726
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:07,307
You're wet, soaking wet and you're
gonna leave in the middle of the night.

727
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,392
Would you just...
Just wait!

728
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,811
My father has
stuck it to me all my life.

729
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,521
What do you want from me?
I want out.

730
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:14,773
Out.

731
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,201
Stop it.

732
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,537
Good morning.
Coffee?

733
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:12,372
Yes.
That'd be good.

734
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:14,916
Sally Dibbs.
Dibbs, Sally.

735
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:17,919
461-0192.

736
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,088
How did you know
my phone number?

737
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:22,966
How'd you know that?

738
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,093
You said read the telephone
book last night. Dibbs, Sally.

739
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:26,636
461-0192.

740
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:31,558
He remembers things,
little things sometimes.

741
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:34,311
Very clever, boys.
I'll be right back.

742
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:36,271
How'd you do that?

743
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:37,314
How'd you do that?

744
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:39,190
I don't know.
You memorized the whole book?

745
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,275
No.

746
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:41,484
You start from the beginning?
Yeah.

747
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:42,902
How far did you get?
"G."

748
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,195
"G"?
"G." Gottsaken.

749
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,739
William Marshall Gottsaken.

750
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,283
You memorized to "G"?
Yeah, "G."

751
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,994
A, B, C, D, E, F, G?

752
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:52,579
"G." Half of "G."

753
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,666
That's good, Ray.
Yeah.

754
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:58,501
I like that.
Yeah.

755
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:04,299
We hungry? Yeah,
Tuesday we have pancakes.

756
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:07,177
Pancakes. That sounds good. We'll get
some pancakes. Yeah, with maple syrup.

757
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:09,095
Hey, bet your butt.
Bet your butt.

758
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:11,973
Uh-oh.

759
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,059
They got pancakes.
Uh-oh.

760
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:15,810
What is this, Ray?

761
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,812
Course, I
don't have my toothpicks.

762
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,315
No, you don't need
toothpicks.

763
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:22,108
That was okay in the hotel
last night with the pizza,

764
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,651
but in a restaurant,
you eat with a fork.

765
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:24,778
Course, I don't have
my toothpicks.

766
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,279
You don't need
toothpicks, Ray.

767
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,531
Pancakes keep sliding off.
You're gonna eat with a fork.

768
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:29,908
I don't have my
maple syrup, either.

769
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:32,202
I'm gonna be without my
maple syrup and my toothpicks.

770
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:34,412
You don't see any pancakes,
do you, Ray?

771
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:37,457
Course, your promised maple
syrup is not here. Ray?

772
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:40,668
When we order the pancakes,
they're gonna bring the maple syrup.

773
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:43,713
Maple syrup is supposed to be
on the table before the pancakes.

774
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,048
We haven't ordered yet, Ray.

775
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:46,800
Course, when they bring the
maple syrup after the pancakes,

776
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,676
it'll definitely
be too late.

777
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,929
How is that gonna be
too late? Huh, Ray?

778
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:52,722
We haven't ordered the pancakes
yet. How is that gonna be...

779
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,474
We're gonna
be here the entire morning

780
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:57,060
with no maple syrup
and no toothpicks,

781
00:39:57,144 --> 00:40:00,438
I'm definitely, definitely not
gonna have my pancakes with...

782
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,815
Ray.
Ow!

783
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,316
Don't make a scene. Ow!

784
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,276
Stop acting like
a fuckin' retard.

785
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:06,736
Uh-oh.

786
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,260
What is this,
what are you writing?

787
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,138
What the fuck is this?

788
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,808
"Serious...
Serious injury list"?

789
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:38,768
"Charlie Babbitt.
Serious injury list"?

790
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,687
What, are you
fuckin' kidding me?

791
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:44,732
"Number 18 in 1988.

792
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:48,111
"Squeezed and pulled
and hurt my neck in 1988."

793
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:51,072
Squeezed and pulled
and hurt your neck in 1988?

794
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,995
Dr. Bruner, it's Charlie
Babbitt. Where are you, son?

795
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:59,456
It's not important.
What matters is who I'm with.

796
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,167
You have to bring him back, Mr.
Babbitt. Do you understand me?

797
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:05,295
No problem whatsoever.
That'll be $1.5 million.

798
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:06,671
I'm not greedy, I just
want my half. Uh-oh.

799
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,256
Raymond, don't touch that.
That's dirty.

800
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:11,217
I can't do that, Mr. Babbitt.
You know I can't.

801
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:13,887
Just bring him back,
and bring him back now.

802
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:14,971
This is where he belongs.

803
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:18,558
I'm his brother. It's not
like kidnapping, is it?

804
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,101
He's always been
a voluntary patient here,

805
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:22,145
but that's beside the point.

806
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:24,772
The fact of the matter is, this
is where he can get the best care.

807
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,192
We're talking
about his well-being.

808
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:29,569
Yeah, let's just cut through
the bullshit, okay?

809
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,821
Now, I am entitled to part
of my father's estate.

810
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:34,991
If you don't want to cut a deal with
me, I'll fly him back to Los Angeles,

811
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,826
stick him in
an institution out there,

812
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:40,163
and we can have
a custody battle over him.

813
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:42,332
Miss, he needs toothpicks.

814
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:44,626
Could you help him, get him some
toothpicks? Thank you very much.

815
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,544
You want to battle me
in the courts?

816
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:48,254
Think about that,

817
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,048
Dr. Bruner, think about that.

818
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:51,925
Or we can cut
a deal right now.

819
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:55,220
I don't think you have any idea of
the severity of Raymond's condition.

820
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:57,305
Toothpicks.
He needs some toothpicks.

821
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:59,599
Can we just get him some
toothpicks over here? Yeah.

822
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:02,852
And I cannot, under any circumstances,
make any money deals with you.

823
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:05,063
Then I'll see you in court.

824
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:12,862
Can I have the check?
Sorry about the toothpicks.

825
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:15,448
82, 82, 82.

826
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:17,158
82 what, Ray?

827
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,035
How much is this?
Toothpicks.

828
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,790
It's a lot more
than 82 toothpicks, Ray.

829
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:26,543
Course, 246 total.

830
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:27,794
Keep the change.

831
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:31,130
Ray. How many toothpicks
are in there?

832
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,882
250.

833
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,385
Pretty close.
Come on. Let's go, Ray.

834
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:37,136
246.

835
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,473
There's four left
in the box.

836
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:43,268
Course, I have to
get my backpack.

837
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,436
Forgot my backpack.

838
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:51,901
97X.
The future of rock and roll.

839
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:58,283
97X. Bam.
The future of rock and roll.

840
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:06,374
97X. Bam.
The future of rock and roll.

841
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:13,506
97X. Bam.
The future of rock and roll.

842
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:14,632
Ray. Ray.

843
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:16,968
Enough already.
Change the channel.

844
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:20,972
97X. Bam.
The future of rock and roll.

845
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:27,562
97X. Bam.
The future of rock and roll.

846
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:31,316
Lenny, I don't care
what you think. Did they say that?

847
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,109
You're gonna have to be
a lot more forceful with them.

848
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:34,444
Lenny, are you...
Lenny, listen.

849
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:36,154
Lenny, Lenny,
shut up a moment here.

850
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:39,782
I am in serious trouble here. I can't
get to these cars. I can't get the money.

851
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,619
Do you understand that?
My loan is past due.

852
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:43,953
Look,
I'll call the loan office...

853
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:45,079
Lenny...

854
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:46,205
...tell them we have
a little problem.

855
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:48,458
Charlie, let me talk...

856
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:52,503
Lenny, just listen to me. I'll
be in LAX in three hours, okay?

857
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:57,592
Now, remember the Buick is in A3, main
terminal. Make sure they pick it up.

858
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:59,844
All right, well, right.
We'll see you in a few.

859
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:12,732
Raymond, let's go.
Raymond.

860
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:17,362
Ray! Ray, let's go.
Come on.

861
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,824
What are you watching, Ray?
I don't know.

862
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:23,409
You don't know?

863
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:27,121
Final call for Flight 1569,

864
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:30,249
service to Salt Lake City
and Los Angeles.

865
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:32,710
Uh-oh.

866
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,046
Uh-oh. Course, there's
an airplane out there.

867
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:36,756
Yeah, that's right, and
everybody's boarding. Let's go.

868
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:38,341
Airline travel's
very dangerous.

869
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:40,134
Don't be silly. It's the
safest travel in the world.

870
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,178
You're gonna love this. Trust me. Yeah.

871
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:44,514
Now, come on.
Oh, no.

872
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:46,224
Ray.
Yeah.

873
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:48,518
We're in an airport.
People fly out of airports.

874
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:50,186
What did you think we were
doing here this whole time?

875
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:53,189
Flying's very dangerous. 1987,
there were 30 airline accidents.

876
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:56,442
211 were fatalities, 231
were definitely passengers.

877
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,236
This plane is very safe.
Believe me.

878
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,571
I gotta get to L.A. I don't
have time for this shit. Come on.

879
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:03,533
I don't know, I don't know.
Ray, Ray...

880
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:05,076
You don't know?
No.

881
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:06,703
What is it? This airline? Yeah.

882
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:07,829
Is it this airline?
Yeah.

883
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:10,123
Okay, fine.
We can...

884
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:12,417
There's an American plane...

885
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:16,462
American Flight 625
crashed April 27, 1976.

886
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:19,382
We don't have to take American,
there's a lot of flights.

887
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:20,925
Yeah.
Pick another airline.

888
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:22,218
Continental.

889
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:25,179
Continental crashed
November 15, 1987.

890
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:27,932
Flight 1713.
28 casualties.

891
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:30,768
This is very serious, Ray.
Very serious.

892
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,562
You see,
I have to get to Los Angeles.

893
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:35,273
All right? So you're gonna get on
that plane, do you understand me?

894
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:37,400
Yeah. You're gonna
have to get on a plane.

895
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:39,318
Yeah, get on a plane.

896
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:43,114
Now, there's a Delta.

897
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:45,992
It leaves at midnight, Ray,
but how's Delta?

898
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:49,454
Delta crashed August 2,
1985. Lockheed L-1011.

899
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:50,747
Dallas/Fort Worth.
All right, Ray.

900
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,707
Terrible wind shear. 135
passengers. All airlines!

901
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:56,252
All airlines have crashed
at one time or another.

902
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:57,754
That doesn't mean
that they are not safe.

903
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:59,839
Qantas.
Qantas?

904
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:01,799
Qantas never crashed.

905
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,510
Qantas?
Never crashed.

906
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:09,807
Well, that's... That's going
to do me a lot of good, Ray.

907
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:12,268
You see, Qantas doesn't fly
to L.A. out of Cincinnati.

908
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:14,020
You have gotta get to
Melbourne. Australia.

909
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:17,148
Melbourne, Australia in order to get
the plane that flies to Los Angeles!

910
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:20,943
Do you hear me? Canberra's the
capital. 16.2 million population.

911
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:22,403
Very lovely beaches.

912
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:25,406
You and I are gonna get
on this fucking plane! No.

913
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:34,749
Ray, Ray, Ray!

914
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:37,794
We're not going to take the
plane. He's okay, he's okay!

915
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:39,837
He's okay. We're not
going to take the plane.

916
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:41,547
Ray, Ray, just...

917
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:43,257
Just relax. He was...

918
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:44,884
He was upset. We were
gonna take the plane.

919
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:47,053
We're not gonna take the plane
now. We're not gonna take the plane.

920
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:49,764
We're not gonna fly, okay?
No flying.

921
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:55,561
We're not gonna fly.
No flying.

922
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:58,105
You tire me, Ray.
Yeah.

923
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:01,484
We're going to drive to Los
Angeles. We're gonna drive to L.A.

924
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:02,860
Okay? Come on, Ray.

925
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:05,655
Ray, come on.
Yeah.

926
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:07,031
Come on. Here.
No flying.

927
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:10,034
Take the bag. We're not gonna take the
plane, Ray. Just grab the fucking bag, man.

928
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:11,410
No flying.

929
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:15,706
You're killing me, Ray. I just want
you to know you are killing me, man.

930
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,625
No flying. I got to be
in L.A. in three hours,

931
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:19,794
it's gonna take me three days.

932
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:21,963
Come on. Come on.

933
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:25,508
No flying.

934
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:27,593
No flying.
No flying.

935
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:32,473
Course,
I got Jeopardy! at 5:00.

936
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:33,683
I watch Jeopardy! at 5:00.

937
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:36,769
Don't start with that.
I've got Jeopardy! at 5:00.

938
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:13,514
Dispatch, this is
Go ahead, 1-0-9.

939
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:16,517
See if you can get another
unit up here for point control.

940
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:18,978
Two more over to you.
10-40.

941
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,607
Come on. Let's go!

942
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:27,570
Bring some more up.
What's your E.T.A.?

943
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:28,738
Uh-oh.

944
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:31,198
Ray.

945
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,826
Ray, get in the car.
Driving is dangerous.

946
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:37,496
Just get in the car.
Are you crazy? Huh?

947
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,332
We'll be outta this
in a second.

948
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:40,416
Yeah.
That's good.

949
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:42,835
It's okay.
That's right.

950
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:45,254
Yeah. We'll be outta here
in a few seconds. That's good.

951
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:46,923
That's good. That's good.

952
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:49,634
There's definitely
a fatal accident over there.

953
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,385
Ray. Ray.

954
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,763
Hey! We don't need your help
up here. Go on back to your car.

955
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:56,349
Just a minute!

956
00:48:57,476 --> 00:48:59,143
Ray. Ray. Ray.

957
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:01,687
Ray.

958
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:04,941
Excuse... Hey!

959
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:07,109
Just wait...
There's nothing to see here.

960
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:08,444
Go back and get in your car.

961
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:09,528
Yes, sir.

962
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:11,739
Wrecks just make him nervous.
Fine. Go back and get in your car.

963
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:14,533
Yes, sir. Just stay there
by the side, okay, Raymond?

964
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:16,535
Ray! Listen, Ray. Just stay
there. A lot of traffic.

965
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:19,080
Yeah.
Definitely a lot of traffic.

966
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:22,041
Hell of a lot of work
for $3 million.

967
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:24,710
Just leave him on the goddamn highway
and just get the hell outta here.

968
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:27,505
Yeah. What? I hear ya!
I hear ya!

969
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:34,762
Stay in your car!

970
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:43,980
What's it gonna be, Ray?
What's it gonna be?

971
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:45,606
This is
a very dangerous highway.

972
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:47,566
How am I gonna get to L.A.?

973
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:50,027
Course, driving a car on this
interstate is very dangerous.

974
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:52,321
You wanna get off the highway?
Will that make you happy?

975
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:54,365
Yeah. Yeah? Well, you
gotta get in the car

976
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:55,533
in order to
get off the highway!

977
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:59,161
Course, in 1986, 46,400 male drivers were
definitely involved in fatal accidents.

978
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:04,834
All right, I got an idea.
I got a great idea.

979
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:07,503
You'll stay in front of the
car until we get off the exit.

980
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,880
You'll get in, and we'll take
the not-so-dangerous road.

981
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,048
Whatever that might be.

982
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:13,009
Is that an idea?
Yeah.

983
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,969
Come on. Give me five, Ray.
That's a great idea.

984
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:16,512
Yeah. Give me five. Yeah. Yeah.

985
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:18,264
This guy's
a fuckin' fruitcake.

986
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:29,108
I'm asking you. Who's on
first? That's the man's name.

987
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:31,694
That's whose name? Yes.
Go ahead and tell me.

988
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,864
Who? The guy on first.
Who? The first baseman.

989
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:35,948
Who is on first.

990
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:38,784
Whose wife? Yes.

991
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,162
After all, the man earns it.
Who does?

992
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:42,204
Absolutely.

993
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:44,957
All I'm tryin' to find out is
what the guy's name on first base.

994
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:46,625
No. What is on second base.

995
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:49,795
I'm not asking you who's on
second base. Who's on first?

996
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:51,172
That's what
I'm tryin' to find out.

997
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:52,339
Get the hell in the car!

998
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:53,924
Don't change the players.
Yeah, get in the car.

999
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:55,968
Get in the car.

1000
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,636
Course, I have to be in bed
by 11:00.

1001
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,972
Lights out at 11:00.
Have to watch TV.

1002
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:08,105
Course, now it's almost
19 minutes to 11:00.

1003
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,940
I have to be in bed at 11:00.
Lights out.

1004
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:12,401
Don't start with this. We're not
flying. We're not on the interstate.

1005
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:15,071
I'm on some shit secondary
road. I gotta make up some time.

1006
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:16,405
I gotta get to Los Angeles.

1007
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,616
I should have been there this
afternoon. My business needs me.

1008
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:19,700
I gotta make up some time.

1009
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:21,285
Definitely watch TV,

1010
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:23,496
but you have to be
in bed at 11:00. Lights out.

1011
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:24,622
Forget it.

1012
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:26,665
Uh-oh, 19 minutes to 11:00.

1013
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,223
This is a good one.

1014
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:43,557
"We don't go out
when it rains. "

1015
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:45,935
This is a real good one, Ray.
I hope you appreciate this,

1016
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:48,604
because my business is going
down the fuckin' toilet.

1017
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:50,272
I should be in L.A.

1018
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:54,235
Instead, I'm in the Honeymoon
Haven Motel in Bumblefuck, Missouri,

1019
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,654
because you won't
go out when it rains.

1020
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:59,365
It's mystifying. I mean,
it's fucking mystifying.

1021
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:04,787
What is this?

1022
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:06,205
Good news, bad news?

1023
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,791
We passed DOT,
but failed EPA.

1024
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:11,252
It all ends up the same.
I can't get my money.

1025
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:14,547
Yes, sir, I'm just stuck in
Cincinnati since the funeral.

1026
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,048
So many leftover details.

1027
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:18,425
My family is,
needless to say,

1028
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:20,010
quite overwhelmed.

1029
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,221
Thank you. I appreciate it.

1030
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:24,932
Well, it is a shock,
to say the least.

1031
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:28,352
Thank you. Is there any way I
can get an extension on that loan?

1032
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:30,312
Just a couple of days.

1033
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,106
It would make
a world of difference.

1034
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:40,406
"We don't go out
when it's raining. "

1035
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:47,830
What? Speak up, Lenny.

1036
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:49,665
Lenny, I bought time, I
didn't buy that kind of time.

1037
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:52,001
What I want you to do is you're
gonna have to... How much?

1038
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:53,460
Course, it's 12:30. What?

1039
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:54,753
Lunch is 12:30.

1040
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,256
Hold on. What do you want for
lunch? Wednesday's fish sticks.

1041
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:59,508
Fish sticks? Green
lime JELL-O for dessert.

1042
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:02,178
Green lime JELL-O.
Want another apple juice?

1043
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:05,222
I want orange soda.
Oh, it's 12:31.

1044
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:06,932
I gotta go. He's starting
to rock and moan.

1045
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:09,810
Yeah, it's definitely
12:32. It's okay. No.

1046
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,655
Course,
there's four fish sticks.

1047
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,199
There's supposed
to be eight fish sticks.

1048
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:25,409
Eight? There's eight.

1049
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:28,579
You take a shower, Ray?
Hmm? Ray?

1050
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:30,623
Ray, you take a shower, right?
Yeah.

1051
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:31,707
Right?
Yeah.

1052
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:33,292
It's the same as the rain.
You get a little wet.

1053
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:36,420
What do you say, Ray?
What do you say? Huh?

1054
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:38,297
Course, the shower's
in the bathroom.

1055
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:41,592
That's the end
of that conversation.

1056
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:44,386
Go again. MAN 2:
British Poetry for 200, please.

1057
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:45,930
The answer at
the top of the category.

1058
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:49,725
"Shakespeare wrote over 150
poems in this 14-line form. "

1059
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:51,644
What is a sonnet?
What is a sonnet?

1060
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:53,812
You got it. Let's try
Double Letters for 200.

1061
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:55,356
The top of that one.

1062
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,150
"The last word in the
Pledge of Allegiance. " Mark.

1063
00:53:58,318 --> 00:53:59,485
What is "stands"?
No.

1064
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:05,282
Stu, legally, Bruner never established
a conservatorship of Raymond?

1065
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:10,037
He didn't figure anyone would
show up to contest his authority.

1066
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:13,332
If that's the case, I
definitely will get custody

1067
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:15,292
and the $3 million, right?
Possibly.

1068
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:19,672
Then you set up a date
for the custody hearing.

1069
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:22,675
Stu, I want a firm date,
and I want it early.

1070
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:24,635
I found that it was
an original record,

1071
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:27,054
because the original song
had two verses...

1072
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:29,765
Lenny, she hasn't come in,
she hasn't called?

1073
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:32,268
If you see her
or hear from her,

1074
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:33,769
tell her to call me
at this number.

1075
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:48,784
The Air
Alpha Force, from Nike.

1076
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:55,040
Would you look at that?
1957 Studebaker Golden Hawk.

1077
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:57,042
Zero to 60
in under eight seconds.

1078
00:54:57,127 --> 00:55:00,045
275 supercharged horsepower
under that hood.

1079
00:55:00,338 --> 00:55:02,298
That's beautiful. Course,
I'm an excellent driver.

1080
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:03,882
You know how to drive?
Yeah.

1081
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:06,468
When did you drive?

1082
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:07,761
Course, I drove the Buick
on the driveway

1083
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:09,555
when my dad
came to Wallbrook.

1084
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:13,434
Was Dad in the car?
Was Dad in the car, Ray?

1085
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,560
Yeah.

1086
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:17,813
And he let you
drive the Buick?

1087
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:19,481
Yeah, slow on the driveway.

1088
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:23,402
I'll have to
let you drive sometime.

1089
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,529
Raymond! Raymond! Raymond!

1090
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:28,657
You never, never touch the
steering wheel when I'm driving!

1091
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:30,617
Do you hear me?
Yeah.

1092
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:32,286
Course, I don't
have my underwear.

1093
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:35,664
What? I'm definitely
not wearing my underwear.

1094
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:36,790
What are you
talking about?

1095
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:37,833
I gave you a fresh pair
of mine this morning.

1096
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:39,209
Not my underwear.

1097
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:42,546
I told you to go in the bathroom
and put them on. Where are they?

1098
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:44,840
Course, they're in
the pocket of my jacket.

1099
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:46,216
Where?
Here.

1100
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:48,927
These are too tight.

1101
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,554
I don't want them back, Ray.
These are not boxer shorts.

1102
00:55:50,638 --> 00:55:51,680
Mine are boxer shorts.

1103
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:54,933
What's the difference?
These are Hanes 32.

1104
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:56,518
My boxer shorts have my name.

1105
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,145
It says "Raymond. "
All right.

1106
00:55:58,271 --> 00:56:00,439
When we pass a store, we'll pick
you up a pair of boxer shorts.

1107
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:02,900
I get my boxer shorts
at Kmart in Cincinnati.

1108
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,652
We're not going back to Cincinnati,
Ray, so don't even start with that.

1109
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:06,779
400 Oak Street.

1110
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:07,863
You're not going
back to Cincinnati.

1111
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:10,032
You don't have to go to
Cincinnati to pick up boxer shorts.

1112
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:12,201
It's Oak and Burnett, in
Cincinnati. What did I say, Ray?

1113
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:13,327
It's Kmart.

1114
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:15,788
You hear me.
I know you hear me.

1115
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:18,123
You don't fool me with
this shit for a second.

1116
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:19,375
Yours are too tight.

1117
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:21,877
Ray, did you
fuckin' hear what I said?

1118
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:23,962
Shut up!
Yeah.

1119
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:28,675
Cincinnati's
a long way off.

1120
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:31,095
We're getting
further away from Kmart.

1121
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:34,056
You don't have to go to Cincinnati
to get a pair of underwear at Kmart.

1122
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,225
You have to go to Kmart.
400 Oak Street.

1123
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:38,727
What'd I tell you, Ray? We're not
going to Cincinnati. That's final.

1124
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:39,812
I get my boxer shorts
at Kmart.

1125
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:41,522
Raymond, that is final!
Do you hear me?

1126
00:56:41,606 --> 00:56:42,815
I'm gonna be short-less.

1127
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:53,075
What difference
does it make...

1128
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:56,203
What difference does it make
where you buy underwear?

1129
00:56:56,287 --> 00:56:57,454
What difference
does it make?

1130
00:56:57,539 --> 00:56:59,456
Underwear is underwear!

1131
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:01,583
It is underwear
wherever you buy it!

1132
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,794
In Cincinnati or wherever!

1133
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:05,129
Kmart.

1134
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:07,464
You know what I think, Ray? Kmart.

1135
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:09,758
I think this autism is
a bunch of shit!

1136
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:12,845
'Cause you can't tell me
you're not in there somewhere!

1137
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:14,388
Boxer shorts.

1138
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:17,057
Boxer shorts at Kmart.

1139
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:20,686
These are...
These are Hanes 32.

1140
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:23,313
You're driving me crazy.
Mine are boxer shorts.

1141
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:25,983
We're gonna have to make a little
stop and find a psychiatrist.

1142
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:27,443
You're driving me crazy.

1143
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:29,236
Oak and Burnett,
that's where the shorts are.

1144
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:30,529
'Cause you are
driving me crazy.

1145
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:32,114
We have to buy them
at Kmart, Oak and Burnett.

1146
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:34,867
We have to buy them
back in... Uh-oh.

1147
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,869
Course, your shorts
are on the highway.

1148
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:39,538
Let's go back
to Cincinnati. Kmart.

1149
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,733
Good luck trying to find
a shrink in this town.

1150
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:40,349
Raymond?

1151
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:25,894
Hey, you.
Hey, dipshit, move it!

1152
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:31,108
If you ain't gonna move,
I'll move you.

1153
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:32,818
Hey, buddy. Hey, you!

1154
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:35,362
You're gonna get run
over out here. Hey! Hey!

1155
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:37,656
You're gonna get hurt. Come
on. It said, "Don't walk. "

1156
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:40,117
Hey! Do you hear me?
Yeah. It said, "Don't walk. "

1157
00:59:40,451 --> 00:59:41,451
Move it. Move it.

1158
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:43,870
Hey, it's all right, sir.

1159
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:45,581
I'm sorry. He's from
out of town. Raymond?

1160
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:47,583
Come on.
Yeah.

1161
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:49,918
It's all right.
Gotta get to Kmart.

1162
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:52,337
Raymond, Raymond, come on.

1163
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:54,089
Kmart, 400 Oak Street.

1164
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:55,424
It said, "Don't walk. "

1165
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:56,508
Yes, it's broken.

1166
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:57,593
It said, "Don't walk. "

1167
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:01,096
This way.
Have to get to Kmart.

1168
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:02,848
400 Oak and Burnett.

1169
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:04,474
Oak and Burnett.

1170
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:09,730
He said, "Young man, go west,"

1171
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:12,065
and this is the way
our country developed

1172
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:14,568
from the East Coast
to the West Coast.

1173
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:20,240
During that period of time
there was initiated

1174
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:24,202
what was known as
the Pony Express.

1175
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:26,788
I'm sure all of you
have read something about it

1176
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:28,332
in the history
of the United States.

1177
01:00:28,666 --> 01:00:31,293
I may not have the days
exactly right or the years,

1178
01:00:31,502 --> 01:00:35,589
but I'm more or less familiar with
the history of the United States.

1179
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:39,051
He's "artistic"?

1180
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:40,385
No, he's autistic.

1181
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:43,305
I'm not familiar with that.

1182
01:00:43,389 --> 01:00:45,557
What is the exact nature
of the problem?

1183
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:49,061
He lives
in a world of his own.

1184
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:53,398
I'm sorry,
but what's wrong with him?

1185
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:56,109
It was a problem gettin' mail
from the East Coast...

1186
01:00:56,277 --> 01:00:58,445
Raymond, do a little of your
"What's On First?" for her.

1187
01:00:58,529 --> 01:01:00,155
Who's on first.
What's on second.

1188
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:01,531
Huh?

1189
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:06,578
They set up
an initial program

1190
01:01:07,121 --> 01:01:08,914
where the Pony Express

1191
01:01:09,248 --> 01:01:12,626
would ride for
approximately 20 miles...

1192
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:16,338
What am I supposed to do?

1193
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:18,423
There's gotta be something
that I can do here.

1194
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:20,842
I'm not a psychiatrist,

1195
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:23,679
but I do know that his brain
doesn't work like other people.

1196
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:25,764
What he does isn't intended
to be annoying.

1197
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:28,725
If he's getting on your
nerves, you just take a break.

1198
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,143
Spend time away from him.

1199
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:31,853
Sure, I'll just
send him back.

1200
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:32,979
Sorry?
Nothing,

1201
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:34,648
just kidding,
it's an inside joke.

1202
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:36,775
You're telling me I just have to
deal with this stuff, is that it?

1203
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:39,361
I just gotta deal
with this stuff.

1204
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:40,987
Yeah, that's about it.

1205
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:45,367
Out of curiosity, does he
have any special abilities?

1206
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:48,995
Well, he's got
a pretty good memory.

1207
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,289
He counts toothpicks.

1208
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:53,834
He spilled a box of
toothpicks on the floor.

1209
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:56,461
He took one look at them and he
knew exactly how many there were.

1210
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:57,879
He counted them in seconds.

1211
01:01:58,715 --> 01:01:59,881
Ray?

1212
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:01,383
Raymond?
Yeah.

1213
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:02,843
Are you good
with numbers?

1214
01:02:03,344 --> 01:02:04,511
Yeah.

1215
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:07,139
I read about this.
I want to try something here.

1216
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:08,473
Kmart.
400 Oak Street.

1217
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,600
What did I tell you? After
this, Raymond. After this.

1218
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,769
Ray, can we try something? Yeah.

1219
01:02:13,312 --> 01:02:19,151
Do you know
how much 312 times 123 is?

1220
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:21,319
38,376.

1221
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:23,113
He's right.

1222
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:24,698
What?
He's right.

1223
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:25,866
He's right?
Yeah.

1224
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:30,203
Ray, how much is 4,343

1225
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:33,457
times 1,234?

1226
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:35,709
5,359,262.

1227
01:02:35,793 --> 01:02:37,294
He's a genius.
That's right.

1228
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:39,504
He's a genius.

1229
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:44,718
Ray, do you know how much
the square root of 2, 130 is?

1230
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:49,514
46. 15192304.

1231
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:51,391
2304.

1232
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:52,851
That's amazing.

1233
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:56,062
That is amazing. He should work
for NASA or something like that.

1234
01:02:57,774 --> 01:03:01,276
If you had a dollar,
and you spent 50 cents,

1235
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,111
how much money
would you have left?

1236
01:03:07,366 --> 01:03:08,658
About 70.

1237
01:03:08,993 --> 01:03:10,494
70 cents?
70 cents.

1238
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:11,953
So much
for the NASA idea.

1239
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:13,997
Kmart.
We should go to Kmart.

1240
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:15,248
What'd I tell ya?
After this, Ray.

1241
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:17,209
400 Oak Street.

1242
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:19,419
Ray, do you know how much
a candy bar costs?

1243
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:21,588
About $100.

1244
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:23,089
$100, huh?
Yeah.

1245
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:25,258
Do you know how much one of
those new compact cars cost?

1246
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:26,718
About $100.

1247
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:31,973
In his particular case, he's pretty
well-off, he's very high-functioning.

1248
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:35,185
Most autistics, they can't
speak or they can't communicate.

1249
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:38,021
Ray?
Yeah.

1250
01:03:38,439 --> 01:03:40,774
Do you know what autistic is? Yeah.

1251
01:03:40,858 --> 01:03:42,442
You know that word?
Yeah.

1252
01:03:44,403 --> 01:03:46,029
Are you autistic?

1253
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:49,366
I don't think so.

1254
01:03:50,284 --> 01:03:53,370
No, definitely not.

1255
01:03:57,917 --> 01:03:59,209
...problem with
the Lamborghinis, Charlie.

1256
01:03:59,293 --> 01:04:01,294
Just shut up a second.
Let me see if I understood this.

1257
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:02,379
Very small. Yeah.

1258
01:04:02,463 --> 01:04:04,673
It's gonna cost me $10,000
additional for each car.

1259
01:04:04,757 --> 01:04:06,132
Course, it's very crowded
in here. Is that...

1260
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:09,010
It's very crowded in here. Ray,
please, just one second, okay?

1261
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:10,095
Huh? What?

1262
01:04:10,763 --> 01:04:12,931
They wanna take out the
manifold and the carburetors

1263
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:14,850
in order to put in
a fuel injection system now?

1264
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:16,184
I mean, that is nonsense.

1265
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:17,727
I know that you're upset.
What are you doing?

1266
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:20,105
Too crowded in here for a
backpack. Just leave this on.

1267
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:23,483
Yeah. It's gonna cost me
$40,000 just to meet EPA now.

1268
01:04:23,776 --> 01:04:25,360
What? No. No. No.

1269
01:04:25,778 --> 01:04:29,614
You give me the number. I'm gonna
call the conversion shop myself.

1270
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:31,491
That's my pen.
That's definitely my book.

1271
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:33,702
Taking your book
is not a serious injury.

1272
01:04:33,786 --> 01:04:35,954
For serious injury, look at
the red book. That book is blue.

1273
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:39,040
Forgive me. I've lost my
secret decoder ring. 4-5-4-5.

1274
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:41,710
You're already number 18. In
1988. Got it. 1988, I know.

1275
01:04:41,794 --> 01:04:43,461
It's my book.
That's my pen.

1276
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:45,839
Uh-oh.
12 minutes to Wapner.

1277
01:04:45,923 --> 01:04:47,716
It's definitely
very small in here.

1278
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,759
Small... and safe.

1279
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:51,261
You don't wanna
miss the party.

1280
01:04:51,345 --> 01:04:52,470
What you're witnessing
is real.

1281
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:54,389
Do you know that? There's
a party in your honor, Ray.

1282
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:58,643
When we get to L.A., a custody hearing.
My lawyer's setting it up right now.

1283
01:04:58,769 --> 01:05:01,563
You know why there's a party for you?
Because you're the 3-million-dollar man.

1284
01:05:01,647 --> 01:05:02,981
What you are witnessing
is real.

1285
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:04,024
Ken Aldorf.

1286
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:05,567
The participants are not
actors. Charlie Babbitt.

1287
01:05:05,651 --> 01:05:06,818
Uh-oh. Fart.

1288
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:08,320
Yeah, Charlie Babbitt.
I'll hold.

1289
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:09,404
Uh-oh. Fart.

1290
01:05:09,655 --> 01:05:10,822
Did you fart, Raymond?
Fart.

1291
01:05:11,365 --> 01:05:12,574
Did you fuckin' fart?
Fart.

1292
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:15,493
Oh, man.
Get the smell out.

1293
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:18,538
How can you stand that?
I don't mind it.

1294
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:19,748
How can you stand that?

1295
01:05:20,124 --> 01:05:21,750
Yeah, Ken.
Ten minutes to Wapner.

1296
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:23,209
Ken? How are you?
This is Charlie Babbitt.

1297
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:25,128
We're definitely locked
in this box with no TV.

1298
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:27,339
I just heard about this
$10,000 charge for every car.

1299
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:30,258
They're definitely gonna
start... How can this be?

1300
01:05:30,384 --> 01:05:32,928
How can this possibly happen right
now? The People's Court starts...

1301
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:34,679
I don't know. You're
telling me another $40,000.

1302
01:05:34,805 --> 01:05:37,474
They start on the button. They
definitely start on the button.

1303
01:05:37,558 --> 01:05:40,185
I've got a problem. I'm gonna have
to call you back from my next stop.

1304
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:42,687
We're not gonna make it to the
program. Okay, my next stop.

1305
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:45,273
Definitely have to go now.
Yes, we're going, Ray.

1306
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:47,692
Just take it easy. Just take it
easy. Eight minutes to Wapner.

1307
01:05:48,152 --> 01:05:50,403
Where am I gonna find
a television around here?

1308
01:05:50,529 --> 01:05:53,031
Eight minutes to Wapner. We
got eight minutes to Wapner.

1309
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:11,383
Come on. Come on.

1310
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:16,680
You wanna get in there and see
the show? Huh? Huh, Raymond?

1311
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:18,640
Wanna get in there and see
the show? Then listen up.

1312
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:21,559
There's not another farmhouse
in sight. This is it, man.

1313
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:26,564
You act weird, we don't
get in. You listening to me?

1314
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:27,649
Yeah.

1315
01:06:27,858 --> 01:06:30,819
I want you to look normal. As
normal as possible, all right?

1316
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:33,655
Just put your hands down.
Don't rock and moan.

1317
01:06:33,739 --> 01:06:35,907
Four minutes to Wapner.
Just shut up and stand there.

1318
01:06:36,033 --> 01:06:37,450
Yeah. Uh...

1319
01:06:37,868 --> 01:06:40,745
Raymond, don't rock and
moan. Put your hands down.

1320
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:46,960
Good afternoon, ma'am. I'm Donald
Clemons from the A.C. Nielsen Company.

1321
01:06:48,629 --> 01:06:49,629
You're familiar with our work?

1322
01:06:49,755 --> 01:06:51,881
Nielsen... I...
You mean the TV ratings?

1323
01:06:51,966 --> 01:06:54,676
Yes, ma'am. That's exactly it. You've
been selected as a preliminary candidate

1324
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:57,971
to become our next Nielsen
family in the tri-county area.

1325
01:06:58,097 --> 01:07:00,932
My husband's not home. If selected,
you'll share the responsibility

1326
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:04,352
for shaping television programming

1327
01:07:04,895 --> 01:07:09,274
in return for which you'll receive a
check in the amount of $286 each month.

1328
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:11,109
Who's he?

1329
01:07:11,235 --> 01:07:15,947
That would be my partner, Mr.
Bainbridge, who does sample...

1330
01:07:19,618 --> 01:07:21,161
Oh, boy.
That's it.

1331
01:07:21,245 --> 01:07:23,580
You blew it. You don't
get to see your program.

1332
01:07:23,664 --> 01:07:25,206
It's finished.
One minute to Wapner.

1333
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:27,917
One minute to Wapner. One
minute to Wapner. One minute to Wapner.

1334
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:29,794
I had you in there, Ray!
You were in there.

1335
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:33,381
Defendants! Plaintiffs!
You had it all!

1336
01:07:33,632 --> 01:07:36,009
Uh-oh. They're in there
making legal history, Ray.

1337
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:38,386
Legal history.
Oh! Oh, boy!

1338
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:39,471
Oh, boy.

1339
01:07:39,638 --> 01:07:40,930
What is going on out here?

1340
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:42,640
I'm sorry, ma'am. I lied
to you. It's gonna be on.

1341
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:45,185
I am very sorry about that. That
man right there is my brother.

1342
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:47,812
If he doesn't watch People's
Court in about 30 seconds

1343
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,564
he's gonna throw a fit
right here on your porch.

1344
01:07:49,648 --> 01:07:52,108
Now, you can help me, or you can
stand there and watch it happen.

1345
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:56,321
We like to watch cartoons.
You think he'd settle for that?

1346
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:59,824
...and she sees
an identical twin.

1347
01:08:00,993 --> 01:08:03,745
True, he didn't have his
shirt on, the other one did,

1348
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:06,372
but they sure
look alike to me.

1349
01:08:06,457 --> 01:08:10,335
If it got on his chest, even if
it didn't burn or got real cold

1350
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:13,088
I put my hand on the dry ice.
Daddy's not here now.

1351
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:16,341
I wanted to take it off quickly
because it got very cold.

1352
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:20,011
I also confess, I was afraid
I might burn my hand.

1353
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:22,013
If I take it and put it up
against a bare chest...

1354
01:08:22,139 --> 01:08:25,266
Gary, work with me on this one.
Believe me, I'm gonna take care of you.

1355
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:30,522
You know that song?
My judgment is for the...

1356
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:36,528
We'Il be back
for the audience reaction

1357
01:08:36,654 --> 01:08:39,739
to Judge Wapner's decision
right after these messages.

1358
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:47,747
The head bone connected
from the neck bone

1359
01:08:47,873 --> 01:08:51,376
The neck bone connected
from the shoulder bone

1360
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:54,796
The shoulder bone connected
from the back bone

1361
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:58,133
The back bone connected
from the hip bone

1362
01:08:58,509 --> 01:09:01,803
The hip bone connected
from the thigh bone

1363
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:05,431
Thigh bone connected
from the knee bone

1364
01:09:05,516 --> 01:09:08,893
The knee bone connected
from the leg bone

1365
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:12,730
The leg bone connected
from the ankle bone

1366
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:16,109
The ankle bone connected
from the heel bone

1367
01:09:17,194 --> 01:09:19,946
My credit card's been
rejected? Yes, sir.

1368
01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:21,990
Must be some accounting error.
How much is this gonna cost?

1369
01:09:22,074 --> 01:09:23,158
$20, sir.

1370
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:25,118
Hear the word of the Lord

1371
01:09:25,202 --> 01:09:27,453
Oh, dem bones, dem bones

1372
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:28,580
Thank you.

1373
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:32,041
Dem bones, dem bones

1374
01:09:32,209 --> 01:09:35,545
Dem bones, dem bones

1375
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:39,048
Now hear
the word of the Lord

1376
01:09:50,561 --> 01:09:56,441
Hear the word of the Lord

1377
01:10:08,162 --> 01:10:09,913
Course, I'm never going back.
It's gonna be a long time.

1378
01:10:09,997 --> 01:10:12,207
It's definitely going to be
a long journey.

1379
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:13,791
Just a couple
of more days, Ray.

1380
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:16,336
Yeah... You know the fella's
name? Then who's playing first?

1381
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:18,630
You mean the fellow playing
first base for St. Louis?

1382
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:20,632
We're gonna start with this again,
Ray? It's just another motel.

1383
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:22,383
You gotta do this
every time?

1384
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,886
That's the man's name.
That's whose name?

1385
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:27,472
What are you asking me for? I'm
not asking you. I'm telling you.

1386
01:10:27,598 --> 01:10:28,932
Who's on first.

1387
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:30,558
I'm asking you
who's on first.

1388
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:32,060
Yo, Ray.

1389
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:34,562
Ray, this is not...
It's not a riddle.

1390
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:36,522
Yeah. You know
the fellow's name?

1391
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:39,317
Then who's playing first? You're never
gonna figure out who's on first base,

1392
01:10:39,401 --> 01:10:41,027
because Who is on first base.

1393
01:10:41,528 --> 01:10:43,112
That's a joke, Ray.
It's comedy.

1394
01:10:43,197 --> 01:10:45,698
Sometimes his wife comes down
and collects it. Whose wife?

1395
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:47,825
It's comedy, man.
Every dollar of it.

1396
01:10:48,702 --> 01:10:50,703
You got a first baseman
on first? Yeah.

1397
01:10:50,788 --> 01:10:52,413
It's a routine between
Abbott and Costello.

1398
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:53,873
When you do it,
you're not funny.

1399
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:56,417
You're the comedy team
of Abbott and Abbott.

1400
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:57,752
You understand
what I'm saying?

1401
01:10:57,836 --> 01:10:59,254
Sometimes his wife
comes down and collects it.

1402
01:10:59,338 --> 01:11:00,630
Whose wife? Yeah.

1403
01:11:00,714 --> 01:11:04,259
Ray, you are never
going to solve it.

1404
01:11:04,885 --> 01:11:07,929
You know why you're never gonna solve
it? 'Cause it's not a riddle, man.

1405
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:11,557
If you understood that, if
you understood that it's funny,

1406
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:13,017
you might get better.

1407
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:16,271
All I'm trying to find out is,
what's the guy's name on first base?

1408
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:18,022
What's the guy's
name on first base?

1409
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:19,774
No. What's the guy's name
on second base.

1410
01:11:19,858 --> 01:11:21,734
Have you got a first
baseman on first? Yeah.

1411
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:23,736
Then who's
playing first? Yeah.

1412
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:27,282
Who's... You know
the fellow's name? Yeah.

1413
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:28,533
Then who's
playing first?

1414
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:30,868
The fella playing
for St. Louis?

1415
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:32,453
Who. The guy on first.

1416
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:34,122
The first baseman.
Who's on first.

1417
01:11:34,206 --> 01:11:35,623
What are you asking me for?

1418
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:37,792
Have you got a first baseman
on first? Yeah.

1419
01:11:37,876 --> 01:11:39,294
All right, Ray. Come on.

1420
01:11:39,378 --> 01:11:42,130
We're gonna put the bed by
the window the way you like.

1421
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:43,715
We got your apple juice.

1422
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:47,218
We're gonna take the pens and paper
out, we're gonna put 'em on the table...

1423
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:49,137
What's the matter, Ray,
did I forget something?

1424
01:11:49,221 --> 01:11:50,221
Cheese balls.

1425
01:11:50,347 --> 01:11:53,224
Yes, I forgot the cheese balls.
Definitely have cheese balls.

1426
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:54,434
But we got them.

1427
01:11:54,518 --> 01:11:55,893
I have to have
12 cheese balls.

1428
01:11:56,687 --> 01:11:58,021
I have to get my tartar
control toothpaste.

1429
01:11:58,105 --> 01:12:00,148
We got that. I got that for
you a couple of days ago.

1430
01:12:00,232 --> 01:12:01,691
Where's my tartar control
toothpaste?

1431
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:04,986
Raymond.

1432
01:12:07,114 --> 01:12:09,282
Raymond, remember when that doctor
asked you those questions today?

1433
01:12:09,366 --> 01:12:11,409
The number questions?
Yeah.

1434
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:12,744
How did you do that?

1435
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:14,412
I see it.
Huh?

1436
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:15,830
I see it.

1437
01:12:16,206 --> 01:12:17,248
What's that?

1438
01:12:17,374 --> 01:12:19,751
Will you stop that
for a second? I see it.

1439
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:21,419
Just put that down, will you?

1440
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:22,670
I'm trying to talk to you.

1441
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:24,589
When I say stop it,
why don't you stop it?

1442
01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:26,758
Why do you always
have to act like an idiot?

1443
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:30,345
You think that's funny?
Yeah.

1444
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:32,347
Funny Rain Man.
Funny teeth.

1445
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:33,514
What did you say?

1446
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:35,058
Funny teeth.
Rinse.

1447
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:42,273
Why did you say...

1448
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:44,525
Why did you say
funny teeth?

1449
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:46,611
You said funny teeth,
funny Rain Man.

1450
01:12:47,696 --> 01:12:49,697
Rain Man?
I said Rain Man?

1451
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:51,282
Yeah, funny Rain Man.

1452
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:57,663
Was I trying to say Raymond,
and it came out Rain Man?

1453
01:12:57,748 --> 01:12:59,540
Yeah, funny Rain Man.

1454
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:03,836
You? You're the Rain Man?

1455
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:20,103
Who took this picture?

1456
01:13:20,187 --> 01:13:21,354
D- A-D.

1457
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:23,731
And you lived with us?

1458
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:27,276
10961 Beechcrest Street,
Cincinnati, Ohio.

1459
01:13:28,153 --> 01:13:30,655
When... When did you leave?

1460
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:32,573
January 21, 1965.

1461
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:34,951
You remember that?
It was Thursday.

1462
01:13:35,035 --> 01:13:36,285
Very snowy out.

1463
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:39,414
7.2 inches of snow
that day.

1464
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:42,708
That's just after mom died,
New Year's.

1465
01:13:42,793 --> 01:13:45,837
Mom died January 5, 1965.

1466
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:47,964
And you remember that day? You
remember that day that you left?

1467
01:13:48,048 --> 01:13:49,549
After short
and sudden illness.

1468
01:13:49,633 --> 01:13:51,843
You remember that day you left? Yeah.

1469
01:13:52,636 --> 01:13:54,762
Was I there?
Where was I?

1470
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:56,597
You were in the window.

1471
01:13:57,015 --> 01:13:58,766
You waved to me.
"Bye-bye, Rain Man. "

1472
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:00,852
"Bye-bye, Rain Man. "

1473
01:14:03,021 --> 01:14:06,315
So you were the one
that sang to me?

1474
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,650
Yeah.

1475
01:14:08,902 --> 01:14:11,988
What did you sing?

1476
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:14,198
What was that song?

1477
01:14:15,075 --> 01:14:16,367
What did you sing?

1478
01:14:18,203 --> 01:14:21,205
Well, she was just 17

1479
01:14:21,832 --> 01:14:24,584
And you know what I mean

1480
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:29,797
And the way she looked
was way beyond compare

1481
01:14:30,924 --> 01:14:36,220
So how could I dance
with another

1482
01:14:36,638 --> 01:14:42,393
When I saw her
standing there?

1483
01:14:47,858 --> 01:14:49,901
Did I like it
when you sang to me?

1484
01:14:50,235 --> 01:14:51,360
Yeah.

1485
01:14:52,404 --> 01:14:55,823
Did we sing any other
songs? You like The Beatles?

1486
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:56,908
Yeah.

1487
01:14:59,912 --> 01:15:02,371
Scary! Scary bad!

1488
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:03,915
Scary bad!

1489
01:15:04,291 --> 01:15:05,625
It's scary!

1490
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:11,255
Scary bad!
What's scary bad?

1491
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:12,757
What's scary bad?

1492
01:15:13,008 --> 01:15:14,467
Hot water burn baby!

1493
01:15:15,302 --> 01:15:16,427
Water!

1494
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:17,845
"Hot water burn baby"?

1495
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:21,015
What baby? Me? Me?
Yeah.

1496
01:15:21,099 --> 01:15:22,767
Easy. Easy. Ray, Ray.

1497
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:25,061
Hot water burn baby.

1498
01:15:25,145 --> 01:15:27,396
I'm not burned.
Look at me. Please.

1499
01:15:27,481 --> 01:15:28,606
Hot water burn baby!
Ray, please. Please!

1500
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:30,525
Please! I'm not burned.

1501
01:15:30,609 --> 01:15:32,568
I'm not burned.
Tub burn baby.

1502
01:15:32,653 --> 01:15:34,612
I'm not burned, man.
Tub burn baby.

1503
01:15:35,155 --> 01:15:36,697
I'm not burned.
Yeah.

1504
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,618
I'm not burned. It's okay.

1505
01:15:41,453 --> 01:15:42,828
Yeah.
Yeah.

1506
01:15:45,415 --> 01:15:46,582
It's okay.

1507
01:15:52,839 --> 01:15:54,465
Gotta go
to Wallbrook now.

1508
01:15:54,883 --> 01:15:56,425
That's why
they put you away.

1509
01:15:57,511 --> 01:15:58,970
They thought
you'd hurt me.

1510
01:16:08,146 --> 01:16:10,898
Never hurt Charlie Babbitt.

1511
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:12,108
What?

1512
01:16:12,651 --> 01:16:14,360
Never hurt
Charlie Babbitt.

1513
01:16:15,946 --> 01:16:17,071
What, Ray?

1514
01:16:17,155 --> 01:16:18,906
Never hurt Charlie Babbitt.

1515
01:16:20,867 --> 01:16:21,993
What?

1516
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:28,916
Come on, it's 11:00, Ray.

1517
01:16:29,001 --> 01:16:30,376
Lights out.
Yeah.

1518
01:16:39,970 --> 01:16:41,762
Never hurt
Charlie Babbitt.

1519
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:43,848
Never, never hurt
Charlie Babbitt.

1520
01:16:51,356 --> 01:16:53,524
There you go. Right where you
like it, at the end of the bed.

1521
01:17:05,537 --> 01:17:06,871
Come on, Ray.

1522
01:17:54,795 --> 01:17:56,212
Hi, it's me.

1523
01:17:57,005 --> 01:17:59,715
Well, you didn't hang up.
Does that mean we're engaged?

1524
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:01,300
Listen, I...

1525
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:06,555
I just wanna hear
it's not over. I mean...

1526
01:18:08,058 --> 01:18:09,850
I'm scared it's over.

1527
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:11,894
Don't ask me
tonight, Charlie.

1528
01:18:11,978 --> 01:18:14,271
I don't know what to say.
Let it sit.

1529
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:16,357
That's something
I'm not real good at.

1530
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:19,402
There's a lot of things
you're not good at.

1531
01:18:19,778 --> 01:18:21,529
I'll call you
when I get back, okay?

1532
01:18:21,613 --> 01:18:22,780
Uh-huh.

1533
01:18:25,492 --> 01:18:26,659
I'll see you.

1534
01:18:26,743 --> 01:18:27,827
Ciao.

1535
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:55,915
What are you
looking at that for, Ray?

1536
01:19:55,999 --> 01:19:57,792
I just spent a couple of
hundred dollars on a little TV,

1537
01:19:57,876 --> 01:19:59,210
and now you're
watching a dryer.

1538
01:19:59,294 --> 01:20:00,669
I don't know.

1539
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:03,422
'Cause believe me, Ray, at the shrink
hearing, we're gonna have to prove

1540
01:20:03,507 --> 01:20:04,924
you prefer to
watch this little TV,

1541
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:06,342
as opposed to
the clothes dryer.

1542
01:20:06,426 --> 01:20:07,676
You understand that?
Yeah.

1543
01:20:07,761 --> 01:20:09,386
You listening to me?
Yeah.

1544
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:12,264
Turn this off, will you,
when you're not watching it?

1545
01:20:12,349 --> 01:20:13,349
Yeah.

1546
01:20:13,433 --> 01:20:17,019
If you run down the batteries, then where
are you gonna be at 3:00 when Wapner's on?

1547
01:20:17,103 --> 01:20:19,396
Yeah, the red one
always falls the same.

1548
01:20:19,731 --> 01:20:21,273
Why aren't you
listening to me?

1549
01:20:21,942 --> 01:20:23,400
You just don't want
to listen to me, do you?

1550
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:26,111
You want to go back
to Wallbrook, is that it?

1551
01:20:26,446 --> 01:20:27,738
I gotta make a phone call.

1552
01:20:39,125 --> 01:20:40,292
Yeah, Lenny,
it's me, listen...

1553
01:20:40,377 --> 01:20:41,502
Charlie, where have you been?

1554
01:20:41,586 --> 01:20:43,337
I've been sitting by this
phone for three hours, man.

1555
01:20:43,421 --> 01:20:45,464
I had some things to do. I had
to buy some clothes and stuff.

1556
01:20:45,549 --> 01:20:48,884
Clothes? Charlie, we are in
serious trouble. Serious trouble!

1557
01:20:48,969 --> 01:20:50,052
What are you
doing buying clothes?

1558
01:20:50,136 --> 01:20:52,096
Just take it easy.
Take it easy.

1559
01:20:52,347 --> 01:20:53,973
I'm in Tucumcari.
I'll be there in a few...

1560
01:20:54,057 --> 01:20:55,808
They repossessed the
cars to pay off the loan.

1561
01:20:55,892 --> 01:20:58,227
The cars are gone,
Charlie. Gone.

1562
01:20:58,937 --> 01:21:01,438
Bateman wants his down
payment back. They all do.

1563
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:03,148
That's 80 thou, Charlie.

1564
01:21:04,192 --> 01:21:05,484
$80,000.

1565
01:21:06,236 --> 01:21:07,528
I don't have it.

1566
01:21:07,612 --> 01:21:10,531
Look, you gotta pay these
people back, or it's all over,

1567
01:21:10,615 --> 01:21:12,199
we're out of business.

1568
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:13,868
What am I
gonna tell them?

1569
01:21:13,952 --> 01:21:15,119
I don't know.

1570
01:21:32,053 --> 01:21:34,305
Son of a bitch!

1571
01:21:34,764 --> 01:21:37,308
Son of a bitch!

1572
01:21:42,606 --> 01:21:47,526
Beyond the blue horizon

1573
01:21:47,611 --> 01:21:54,283
Lies the rising sun

1574
01:21:55,619 --> 01:22:01,498
Beyond the blue horizon

1575
01:22:01,875 --> 01:22:07,713
Waits a beautiful day

1576
01:22:11,885 --> 01:22:14,637
This would be a lot easier, Ray,
if you just let me put the top up.

1577
01:22:14,721 --> 01:22:15,721
You wouldn't have to fry.

1578
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:18,515
Put this lotion on you so
you don't burn. All right?

1579
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:19,600
Oh. Oh.
Ray.

1580
01:22:20,435 --> 01:22:22,269
Don't start with that.
You want me to put the top up?

1581
01:22:22,354 --> 01:22:23,395
I definitely
like the top down.

1582
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:25,481
Yes, I know that.
Now, I don't want you to burn.

1583
01:22:25,649 --> 01:22:29,568
Yeah. Definitely like it
when the top's... Ow. Ooh.

1584
01:22:29,653 --> 01:22:32,237
It's all right. Just take
it easy. Take it easy.

1585
01:22:32,322 --> 01:22:33,864
Oh, no.
It's almost over.

1586
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:36,200
Uh-huh. All right.
How does that feel?

1587
01:22:36,284 --> 01:22:37,284
Very slippery.

1588
01:22:47,212 --> 01:22:49,380
Maldonado swings
and hits a hot shot through the box

1589
01:22:49,464 --> 01:22:51,548
into center field
for a base hit.

1590
01:22:52,425 --> 01:22:53,509
One run is in.

1591
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,094
Here's Brenly going to third.

1592
01:22:55,178 --> 01:22:56,595
The throw by Davis...

1593
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:58,055
Not in time!

1594
01:22:59,182 --> 01:23:03,686
Brenly in safely at third base
on Maldonado's single.

1595
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:04,895
Looks like he held that ball

1596
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:07,481
out in center field a little bit
too long, don't you think so, Ed?

1597
01:23:07,565 --> 01:23:09,441
Take a look at it
once again.

1598
01:23:09,901 --> 01:23:12,736
Treadwell played it way
over towards the right side.

1599
01:23:13,488 --> 01:23:14,905
Shading him to pull.

1600
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:17,533
Okay, here's Davis.

1601
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:21,745
Yeah, he seems to hold
it there just a bit, Tom.

1602
01:23:22,455 --> 01:23:23,956
Sort of double-pumped it,
didn't he?

1603
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:25,457
Watch it here
on the replay again.

1604
01:23:26,334 --> 01:23:28,460
He loses all chance
at a play on Brenly,

1605
01:23:28,545 --> 01:23:31,797
even though Brenly doesn't exactly
pick 'em up and lay 'em down.

1606
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:36,635
And the throw into third base
finally is a little bit long...

1607
01:24:09,502 --> 01:24:11,003
Will you give me
a break with this?

1608
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:12,629
Can't.

1609
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:16,508
Ray, stop it.

1610
01:24:16,843 --> 01:24:20,554
But there is something
every woman needs

1611
01:24:20,805 --> 01:24:26,310
And a friendly smile will
do it every time

1612
01:24:28,772 --> 01:24:31,565
Lonely women make
good lovers

1613
01:24:31,649 --> 01:24:32,816
J-7.

1614
01:24:34,861 --> 01:24:35,861
K-7? What's that?

1615
01:24:35,945 --> 01:24:36,987
J-7.

1616
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:40,282
What's J-7?

1617
01:24:42,494 --> 01:24:44,703
What's J-7? The song?
The song's J-7?

1618
01:24:44,788 --> 01:24:45,746
Yeah.

1619
01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:49,708
Lonely women make
good lovers

1620
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,879
So if you've
got a woman...

1621
01:24:53,963 --> 01:24:55,506
Look out there, Raymond.

1622
01:24:56,007 --> 01:24:57,758
No, Raymond, out here.
Yeah.

1623
01:25:00,428 --> 01:25:01,929
"Eighteen Wheels
and a Dozen Roses. "

1624
01:25:02,013 --> 01:25:03,430
What's the number?

1625
01:25:03,515 --> 01:25:04,598
E-5.

1626
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,604
"Cheating Heart,
Hank Williams. "

1627
01:25:10,897 --> 01:25:14,191
Your Cheating Heart. Course,
that's Hank Williams, Jr.

1628
01:25:14,275 --> 01:25:16,110
D-1. D-1.

1629
01:25:20,031 --> 01:25:21,782
"Blue Moon of Kentucky,
Bill Monroe. "

1630
01:25:21,866 --> 01:25:23,575
And the Blue Grass Boys.
T-5.

1631
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:29,081
How many toothpicks came
out of that box, Raymond?

1632
01:25:29,165 --> 01:25:30,415
246.

1633
01:25:32,168 --> 01:25:34,211
Yeah.
246.

1634
01:25:35,421 --> 01:25:37,005
You paying attention?
Yeah.

1635
01:25:42,929 --> 01:25:44,596
You watching that?
Yeah.

1636
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:50,394
You seeing that, Ray,
you catching that?

1637
01:25:50,478 --> 01:25:51,854
Yeah, falling
on the ground.

1638
01:25:55,024 --> 01:25:56,650
Okay. Now what...

1639
01:25:57,443 --> 01:25:58,819
What do I have left?

1640
01:25:59,487 --> 01:26:01,905
Two jacks, one 8,
one king, one 6,

1641
01:26:02,073 --> 01:26:05,159
two aces, one 10,
one 9, one 5.

1642
01:26:05,243 --> 01:26:06,410
One 5.
Yeah.

1643
01:26:07,287 --> 01:26:08,704
You are beautiful, man.

1644
01:26:32,562 --> 01:26:33,520
I'm an excellent driver.

1645
01:26:33,605 --> 01:26:35,189
You can't drive now, Ray.

1646
01:26:35,273 --> 01:26:36,690
Are you listening to me?
This is very important.

1647
01:26:36,774 --> 01:26:40,611
When there's lots of 1 Os left, 1 Os
and picture cards left, it's good for us.

1648
01:26:40,695 --> 01:26:41,820
Now, come on, say it.
"1 Os are good. "

1649
01:26:41,905 --> 01:26:43,113
1 Os are good.

1650
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:44,364
Okay, if you're
going to bet one...

1651
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:46,700
One if it's bad,
two if it's good.

1652
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:49,036
That's right.
Two if it's good, Ray.

1653
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:51,538
Now, listen,
casinos have house rules.

1654
01:26:53,124 --> 01:26:55,751
The first one is,
they don't like to lose.

1655
01:26:56,377 --> 01:26:59,421
So you never, never show
that you are counting cards.

1656
01:26:59,505 --> 01:27:01,715
That is
the cardinal sin, Ray.

1657
01:27:01,841 --> 01:27:04,384
Are you listening to me?
That's very, very important.

1658
01:27:04,469 --> 01:27:07,262
Yeah. Counting is bad.

1659
01:27:07,347 --> 01:27:09,264
Yes, counting is bad.

1660
01:27:09,766 --> 01:27:11,892
I like to drive slow
on the driveway.

1661
01:27:11,976 --> 01:27:13,435
You get this right, Ray,

1662
01:27:13,519 --> 01:27:16,104
you can drive wherever
you want as slow as you like.

1663
01:27:16,189 --> 01:27:17,689
I'm an excellent driver.

1664
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:53,600
Miss Sue Morgan, please
pick up the hotel courtesy phone.

1665
01:27:53,726 --> 01:27:57,521
Miss Sue Morgan, please pick
up the hotel courtesy phone.

1666
01:27:58,481 --> 01:27:59,523
Raymond.

1667
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:41,458
Rain Man?
Yeah.

1668
01:29:41,626 --> 01:29:43,627
Let's play some cards.
Yeah.

1669
01:29:53,304 --> 01:29:54,471
You want a hit?

1670
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:56,181
No. You don't want a hit.
You've got 18.

1671
01:29:56,265 --> 01:29:57,265
I want a hit.

1672
01:29:57,350 --> 01:29:58,558
Sir, you have 18.

1673
01:29:58,643 --> 01:30:00,560
You don't want to hit. He
doesn't want to hit. Hit me.

1674
01:30:00,645 --> 01:30:02,437
Definitely want a hit.
Hitting 18.

1675
01:30:02,522 --> 01:30:03,563
He doesn't want to hit.

1676
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:04,940
Hit me, hit me, hit me.
No, don't!

1677
01:30:06,609 --> 01:30:07,776
You took my queen, Ray.

1678
01:30:07,860 --> 01:30:09,403
I've got a 10,
I needed that queen.

1679
01:30:09,487 --> 01:30:10,695
I can't take your queen!

1680
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:12,656
Sir, please don't
touch the cards.

1681
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:14,408
I need my own queen, Ray.

1682
01:30:14,492 --> 01:30:15,826
There's lots of them.

1683
01:30:16,744 --> 01:30:18,829
There's lots of them?
Lots and lots of them.

1684
01:30:19,747 --> 01:30:21,873
Hold on here for a second.

1685
01:30:25,545 --> 01:30:26,711
I'm gonna double down.

1686
01:30:28,047 --> 01:30:30,340
Queen, queen.

1687
01:30:30,842 --> 01:30:32,008
Yes!

1688
01:30:32,343 --> 01:30:34,928
Yes, sir.
You gotta love this town.

1689
01:30:36,889 --> 01:30:38,140
I'm going for it, Nick.

1690
01:30:38,975 --> 01:30:40,225
It looks like it.

1691
01:30:40,309 --> 01:30:42,144
It certainly
looks like it.

1692
01:30:58,035 --> 01:30:59,703
Wanna bet one chip
or two chips, Ray?

1693
01:30:59,787 --> 01:31:00,912
Bet two.

1694
01:31:02,039 --> 01:31:03,123
Bet two.

1695
01:31:49,879 --> 01:31:51,505
What's your secret, guys?

1696
01:31:51,589 --> 01:31:52,881
We cheat.

1697
01:31:54,425 --> 01:31:58,011
This is Sam.
Tape table 47.

1698
01:32:04,936 --> 01:32:06,186
About $85,000.

1699
01:32:06,270 --> 01:32:09,356
$85,000? Did you call
the Eye in the Sky?

1700
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:10,440
Sam did.

1701
01:32:10,525 --> 01:32:11,775
Sam did? Okay, I'll take over from here.

1702
01:32:11,859 --> 01:32:12,859
All right.

1703
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:20,617
All right!

1704
01:32:21,953 --> 01:32:24,162
You're doing well.
I'm happy for you, sir.

1705
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:30,377
What do you see?

1706
01:32:30,461 --> 01:32:33,672
Well, he's not catching the
hole card and he's not past posting us.

1707
01:32:33,756 --> 01:32:36,049
I don't see him
using a computer.

1708
01:32:36,133 --> 01:32:37,592
No, he's not,
but something's not right.

1709
01:32:37,677 --> 01:32:40,428
You know there's no one in the
world can count into a six-deck shoe.

1710
01:33:14,505 --> 01:33:16,131
Hold it.
Hold it here.

1711
01:33:18,092 --> 01:33:19,759
Watch my chips.
I'm gonna be back in second.

1712
01:33:19,844 --> 01:33:21,052
Go right ahead, sir.

1713
01:33:23,889 --> 01:33:25,932
Ray, what are you doing?
We're in the middle of a hand.

1714
01:33:26,225 --> 01:33:28,184
You don't leave in the middle
of a hand. Ray, Ray, Ray!

1715
01:33:28,269 --> 01:33:31,396
We're hot. We are red hot! The
Babbitt brothers, kickin' ass in Vegas!

1716
01:33:31,522 --> 01:33:34,566
Wheel of Fortune. We got Cleopatra
and Caesar over there waiting for you.

1717
01:33:34,692 --> 01:33:37,277
Come on, Ray. "Look at all
this glamorous merchandise. "

1718
01:33:37,361 --> 01:33:39,112
One for bad, two for good. 20.

1719
01:33:39,196 --> 01:33:40,530
20?
Yeah.

1720
01:33:41,032 --> 01:33:42,115
It's going to hit on 20?

1721
01:33:42,199 --> 01:33:43,783
Yeah, 20, definitely 20.

1722
01:33:44,410 --> 01:33:46,453
$3,000 on 20.

1723
01:33:48,456 --> 01:33:49,497
Definitely 20.

1724
01:33:49,624 --> 01:33:50,874
Definitely 20?
Yeah.

1725
01:33:58,090 --> 01:33:59,215
Uh-oh.

1726
01:34:02,011 --> 01:34:03,595
It's not your game, Ray.
Yeah.

1727
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:05,347
I just lost $3,000.
Yeah.

1728
01:34:05,765 --> 01:34:07,182
That's $3,000 I lost.

1729
01:34:07,266 --> 01:34:09,309
Come on, Ray, come on,
a little...

1730
01:34:09,393 --> 01:34:12,812
No? Easy, don't start
banging yourself, all right?

1731
01:34:13,314 --> 01:34:15,690
Maybe we'll play a
little bit later. Yeah.

1732
01:34:15,941 --> 01:34:17,734
I'm gonna cash in.
Yeah, cash in.

1733
01:34:18,611 --> 01:34:19,903
You make me sad, Ray.

1734
01:34:22,198 --> 01:34:23,239
20.

1735
01:34:26,202 --> 01:34:29,120
We won $86,000 and
some change, right, Ray?

1736
01:34:29,205 --> 01:34:30,497
$86,500.

1737
01:34:30,581 --> 01:34:31,790
$80,000.

1738
01:34:32,667 --> 01:34:34,668
Refund on
the car payments,

1739
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:35,794
and I owe...

1740
01:34:36,003 --> 01:34:38,546
What did I say I owe
to get the Rolex back?

1741
01:34:38,631 --> 01:34:39,673
$3,500.

1742
01:34:39,757 --> 01:34:41,007
Six months to pay.

1743
01:34:41,092 --> 01:34:44,260
$3,500. We don't have to pay
for the room, that's comped.

1744
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:46,846
I'm free and clear. I'm gonna
go take a celebration piss.

1745
01:34:50,101 --> 01:34:53,561
Don't go anywhere. Until I get
back, the sign says "Don't walk. "

1746
01:34:53,646 --> 01:34:55,480
Don't walk.
Don't walk.

1747
01:35:14,709 --> 01:35:15,709
Hey.

1748
01:35:17,211 --> 01:35:19,129
You looking for a date?

1749
01:35:19,338 --> 01:35:20,922
Are you?
I don't know.

1750
01:35:21,382 --> 01:35:23,216
What's your name?
Raymond.

1751
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:24,509
My name is Iris.

1752
01:35:25,761 --> 01:35:27,387
Raymond, you like me?

1753
01:35:27,471 --> 01:35:28,763
I don't know.

1754
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:30,390
You don't know?

1755
01:35:30,975 --> 01:35:32,684
I think if you gave me
a chance, you would.

1756
01:35:32,768 --> 01:35:34,853
Why don't we try to get
to know each other?

1757
01:35:34,937 --> 01:35:36,271
Yeah, get to know
each other.

1758
01:35:36,355 --> 01:35:37,981
He doesn't have
any money, honey.

1759
01:35:39,817 --> 01:35:42,402
That's all right, sugar,
'cause we are just talking.

1760
01:35:42,486 --> 01:35:43,987
Yeah, we're just talking.

1761
01:35:45,740 --> 01:35:47,407
Let's go upstairs, Ray.
What are you doing, man?

1762
01:35:47,491 --> 01:35:49,200
Getting to know
each other.

1763
01:35:49,326 --> 01:35:51,369
Just talking. What
room? I'll bring him up.

1764
01:35:51,495 --> 01:35:52,787
That's all right.

1765
01:35:54,290 --> 01:35:55,290
Is that what you want to do?

1766
01:35:55,374 --> 01:35:56,750
You want to stay here and
get to know each other, Ray?

1767
01:35:56,834 --> 01:35:59,669
Yeah. Get to know
each other. Just talking.

1768
01:36:00,254 --> 01:36:01,629
This will be interesting.
Yeah.

1769
01:36:01,672 --> 01:36:03,840
I'll be over here just
in case. RAYMOND: Yeah.

1770
01:36:05,176 --> 01:36:06,801
He doesn't seem to like me.
Who is he?

1771
01:36:06,886 --> 01:36:09,095
He's my brother.
I'm living in his room.

1772
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:10,638
He seems young
to be your brother.

1773
01:36:10,723 --> 01:36:13,475
He was born
August 12, 1962.

1774
01:36:13,559 --> 01:36:14,768
It was a Sunday.

1775
01:36:17,188 --> 01:36:19,022
What exactly
do you guys do here?

1776
01:36:19,899 --> 01:36:21,274
We're counting cards.

1777
01:36:21,692 --> 01:36:23,443
You're counting cards?

1778
01:36:23,527 --> 01:36:24,861
We're counting cards.

1779
01:36:25,529 --> 01:36:27,781
Uh-huh.
We're counting cards.

1780
01:36:27,865 --> 01:36:29,199
What else do you do?

1781
01:36:30,201 --> 01:36:31,868
We're counting cards.

1782
01:36:31,952 --> 01:36:34,078
I know that you're counting
cards. What else do you do?

1783
01:36:34,163 --> 01:36:36,206
Are you taking
any prescription medication?

1784
01:36:36,791 --> 01:36:39,042
Whoa. Look, I'm out of here.

1785
01:36:40,544 --> 01:36:41,961
Course,
what time is the date?

1786
01:36:42,046 --> 01:36:43,922
Later.
What time is the date?

1787
01:36:44,048 --> 01:36:47,342
It's 10:00! Course, I have to be in
bed at 11:00. Lights out at 11:00.

1788
01:36:47,426 --> 01:36:50,512
10:00 daylight-saving time.

1789
01:36:50,721 --> 01:36:53,890
10:00 daylight-saving time.
10:00?

1790
01:36:53,974 --> 01:36:55,308
You like her, Ray?
You think she's pretty?

1791
01:36:55,392 --> 01:36:57,310
Yeah. She's very sparkly.

1792
01:36:57,394 --> 01:36:58,770
Definitely very sparkly.

1793
01:36:58,896 --> 01:37:00,230
Very sparkly.

1794
01:37:03,234 --> 01:37:04,651
He did a great job
on that suit.

1795
01:37:04,735 --> 01:37:06,778
You don't realize
how good you look.

1796
01:37:06,862 --> 01:37:08,530
Do you like it?
It's not Kmart.

1797
01:37:09,365 --> 01:37:10,698
How could you
not like that suit?

1798
01:37:10,783 --> 01:37:12,534
You look fantastic, Ray.

1799
01:37:12,618 --> 01:37:13,701
How can you
not like that suit?

1800
01:37:13,786 --> 01:37:14,786
It's not a Kmart suit.

1801
01:37:14,912 --> 01:37:16,621
I'm gonna let you in on
a little secret. Yeah.

1802
01:37:16,705 --> 01:37:19,249
Kmart sucks. Okay?
Yeah.

1803
01:37:22,753 --> 01:37:24,170
There you go, Ray.
Yeah.

1804
01:37:24,547 --> 01:37:26,089
It's the
high rollers' suite.

1805
01:37:26,423 --> 01:37:27,590
This is for you.

1806
01:37:28,551 --> 01:37:30,343
Ever seen a room
like this before?

1807
01:37:31,053 --> 01:37:32,428
What's up there?

1808
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:33,721
What's up there?

1809
01:37:33,806 --> 01:37:35,056
You're not even looking, man.

1810
01:37:35,474 --> 01:37:36,516
Yeah. Bed.

1811
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:37,892
That's a bed.
That's your bed.

1812
01:37:37,977 --> 01:37:39,269
I had them put it up there
especially for you,

1813
01:37:39,353 --> 01:37:40,562
right by the window,
just the way you like it.

1814
01:37:40,688 --> 01:37:42,689
Bed by the window.
That's right. Go on up.

1815
01:37:44,108 --> 01:37:46,067
Just the way you
like it, isn't it? Yeah.

1816
01:37:48,195 --> 01:37:50,280
Look at you
with all those lights, Ray.

1817
01:37:50,447 --> 01:37:53,324
Mr. Vegas. You are
Mr. Las Vegas now, man.

1818
01:37:53,951 --> 01:37:55,159
What do you think?

1819
01:37:55,244 --> 01:37:58,121
There's a lot of lights out
there. Very sparkly. Very twinkly.

1820
01:37:59,248 --> 01:38:00,665
We made
a lot of money today.

1821
01:38:00,749 --> 01:38:02,250
We made a lot of money!

1822
01:38:02,793 --> 01:38:06,880
Forgetting the $3,000 that we
tossed away at that wheel of fortune.

1823
01:38:06,964 --> 01:38:08,590
Yeah, wheel of fortune.

1824
01:38:09,258 --> 01:38:10,550
I'm sorry about that.

1825
01:38:10,634 --> 01:38:12,802
I'm sorry, you know,
I got a little carried away.

1826
01:38:12,887 --> 01:38:15,513
I got a little hot, okay, Ray?
Yeah.

1827
01:38:17,266 --> 01:38:20,393
I'm saying that I'm sorry, and I
just want you to know that I am sorry.

1828
01:38:22,521 --> 01:38:23,813
I'm apologizing.

1829
01:38:24,315 --> 01:38:26,065
I got a little carried away.

1830
01:38:26,150 --> 01:38:29,319
The money...
I got a little greedy.

1831
01:38:30,237 --> 01:38:31,237
Want to say something?

1832
01:38:31,322 --> 01:38:33,740
I have to be at the bar
at 10:00 with Iris.

1833
01:38:33,824 --> 01:38:35,575
I mean, 'cause, you know,
I've got to thank you, man.

1834
01:38:35,659 --> 01:38:36,826
You...

1835
01:38:38,329 --> 01:38:39,913
You did it. You did it.

1836
01:38:39,997 --> 01:38:41,456
I was just there.

1837
01:38:41,916 --> 01:38:43,124
You saved my ass.

1838
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:46,127
I was just
along for the ride.

1839
01:38:46,211 --> 01:38:48,087
Have to be
at the bar at 10:00.

1840
01:38:48,756 --> 01:38:50,048
Have to go
to the date with Iris.

1841
01:38:50,132 --> 01:38:51,925
Yeah, Iris.
That's her name.

1842
01:38:52,176 --> 01:38:53,593
Big date.
Going to go dancing.

1843
01:38:53,677 --> 01:38:54,928
Yeah, dancing.

1844
01:38:55,012 --> 01:38:57,013
Have to go to the date
with Iris at the bar, dancing.

1845
01:38:57,097 --> 01:38:58,556
Know how to dance?

1846
01:38:58,807 --> 01:38:59,891
I don't know.

1847
01:38:59,975 --> 01:39:01,809
You don't know how to dance?
You ought to learn sometime.

1848
01:39:01,894 --> 01:39:04,979
Have to learn
to dance with a date.

1849
01:39:05,064 --> 01:39:07,231
Have to learn
to dance with a date.

1850
01:39:07,316 --> 01:39:10,193
I was just kidding, Ray. You're not
gonna have to dance on this date.

1851
01:39:10,527 --> 01:39:12,153
Have to go to the date.
Learn to dance.

1852
01:39:12,237 --> 01:39:13,863
Definitely. Now.

1853
01:39:14,490 --> 01:39:15,782
Ray, you don't have
to dance now,

1854
01:39:15,866 --> 01:39:17,325
but, listen, I'll teach
you how to dance sometime.

1855
01:39:17,409 --> 01:39:18,534
Definitely have to.

1856
01:39:18,661 --> 01:39:20,286
No, you're not
gonna have to dance on this.

1857
01:39:20,371 --> 01:39:22,497
Definitely have to learn
to dance now for the date.

1858
01:39:22,581 --> 01:39:24,415
Sorry I even brought
this up. All right, Ray.

1859
01:39:24,541 --> 01:39:26,918
You're right. My mistake. 10:00.

1860
01:39:27,044 --> 01:39:30,088
You got the only famous
dancing hooker in Vegas.

1861
01:39:30,172 --> 01:39:31,214
All right.
Stand over there.

1862
01:39:37,721 --> 01:39:39,681
My lonely days are over

1863
01:39:39,765 --> 01:39:41,015
Come over here.
Yeah.

1864
01:39:43,143 --> 01:39:44,936
Now, you hear the music? Yeah.

1865
01:39:45,020 --> 01:39:46,396
Just watch my feet.

1866
01:39:46,563 --> 01:39:47,939
Raymond, watch my feet.

1867
01:39:49,024 --> 01:39:50,483
Yeah.
Just do what I'm doing.

1868
01:39:51,652 --> 01:39:53,945
Okay, you see? You feel
the rhythm of the music?

1869
01:39:54,029 --> 01:39:56,030
We're just moving
our feet like that.

1870
01:39:56,365 --> 01:39:59,575
Okay? Now, you're the guy,
so you're gonna have to lead.

1871
01:39:59,660 --> 01:40:01,619
All right, and I'm the date,
so you want to...

1872
01:40:01,704 --> 01:40:03,997
The skies above are blue

1873
01:40:04,248 --> 01:40:05,748
You want to...

1874
01:40:05,958 --> 01:40:07,583
Put your left hand
up like this.

1875
01:40:07,668 --> 01:40:08,668
Raymond, don't stop moving.

1876
01:40:08,752 --> 01:40:10,336
Raymond, paying attention? Yeah.

1877
01:40:10,421 --> 01:40:12,964
Don't stop moving. Put
your left hand up like this.

1878
01:40:13,048 --> 01:40:15,049
Yeah. Left hand up. That's good.

1879
01:40:15,134 --> 01:40:17,051
Don't stop moving.
Just keep moving.

1880
01:40:17,511 --> 01:40:18,678
That's good.
Just like that.

1881
01:40:18,762 --> 01:40:21,764
Now you wanna take this other hand,
you wanna put it around behind my back.

1882
01:40:22,266 --> 01:40:24,058
Want to learn how to dance? Yeah.

1883
01:40:24,143 --> 01:40:25,977
Okay, 'cause you gotta
touch someone when you dance.

1884
01:40:26,061 --> 01:40:28,229
I'm not going to hurt
you, all right? Yeah.

1885
01:40:28,772 --> 01:40:30,273
Just put it right there.

1886
01:40:30,858 --> 01:40:32,650
I take my hand,
I put it up here.

1887
01:40:33,444 --> 01:40:34,652
Watch my feet, Ray.

1888
01:40:34,737 --> 01:40:36,821
Watch my feet.
The rhythm, the rhythm.

1889
01:40:37,948 --> 01:40:39,073
All right?

1890
01:40:39,742 --> 01:40:41,576
Now, when you dance you can't
watch my feet the whole time,

1891
01:40:41,660 --> 01:40:43,870
so you're gonna have to look up. Yeah.

1892
01:40:43,954 --> 01:40:48,583
When I tell you to, I want
you to just look up, real slow.

1893
01:40:48,667 --> 01:40:50,084
Just keep moving.

1894
01:40:50,586 --> 01:40:52,086
Okay, you ready?
Yeah.

1895
01:40:52,171 --> 01:40:53,463
All right, start looking up. Yeah.

1896
01:40:54,631 --> 01:40:56,632
A little more.
Keep moving.

1897
01:40:57,134 --> 01:40:58,676
Just a little more.
Yeah.

1898
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:01,220
A little more, Ray.

1899
01:41:01,847 --> 01:41:03,222
All the way up.

1900
01:41:03,348 --> 01:41:05,475
You smile

1901
01:41:05,934 --> 01:41:07,602
There you go, Ray.
Yeah.

1902
01:41:07,686 --> 01:41:08,895
You're dancing.
This is it.

1903
01:41:08,979 --> 01:41:10,313
Yeah, dancing.

1904
01:41:10,481 --> 01:41:12,482
You want to close
your hand here. Just...

1905
01:41:13,150 --> 01:41:15,068
You wanna pull like that.

1906
01:41:15,152 --> 01:41:17,153
You're gonna
turn me like this, okay?

1907
01:41:17,237 --> 01:41:18,863
Here we are in heaven

1908
01:41:18,947 --> 01:41:20,490
Just turn. That's good.

1909
01:41:20,866 --> 01:41:23,034
This is dancing.
This is dancing.

1910
01:41:23,494 --> 01:41:25,328
Don't know about you, but I'm
starting to feel a little silly.

1911
01:41:25,412 --> 01:41:28,706
For you are mine

1912
01:41:28,791 --> 01:41:32,627
At last

1913
01:42:00,197 --> 01:42:01,531
That's it.
Yeah.

1914
01:42:01,615 --> 01:42:04,033
All right!
All right!

1915
01:42:04,159 --> 01:42:06,119
Beautiful! You are a good dancer! Yeah.

1916
01:42:06,203 --> 01:42:07,411
You wanna give me a hug? Yeah.

1917
01:42:07,496 --> 01:42:08,621
Yeah?
Yeah.

1918
01:42:20,759 --> 01:42:23,302
I just wanted
to give you a hug, Ray.

1919
01:42:25,973 --> 01:42:27,723
Just felt like
giving you a hug.

1920
01:42:43,991 --> 01:42:45,408
What are you doing here?

1921
01:42:45,617 --> 01:42:47,076
I'm unemployed.

1922
01:42:47,244 --> 01:42:48,244
What do you mean?

1923
01:42:48,287 --> 01:42:50,288
You don't know about the business?
I know about the business.

1924
01:42:50,372 --> 01:42:52,248
Come on in. It's okay.

1925
01:42:54,793 --> 01:42:57,044
I'm glad to see you.

1926
01:42:58,046 --> 01:42:59,630
Ray, look who's here.

1927
01:43:24,948 --> 01:43:27,700
It's not right, what
you're doing to Raymond.

1928
01:43:27,784 --> 01:43:29,035
He's fine.

1929
01:43:29,119 --> 01:43:33,956
I know he's fine. He's in Las
Vegas in a suit, in a big room.

1930
01:43:34,166 --> 01:43:35,458
It makes me sad.

1931
01:43:35,876 --> 01:43:37,293
Six minutes to my date.

1932
01:43:37,377 --> 01:43:38,753
Six minutes to Iris.

1933
01:43:40,130 --> 01:43:41,547
He has a date?

1934
01:43:43,133 --> 01:43:44,133
Raymond, it'd be nice

1935
01:43:44,218 --> 01:43:47,303
if you didn't carry that
television everywhere we go.

1936
01:43:47,387 --> 01:43:49,764
What do you gotta bring a
Watchman for on your date?

1937
01:43:49,848 --> 01:43:51,515
The man's dancing.

1938
01:43:51,808 --> 01:43:54,310
But what does your
date look like, Raymond?

1939
01:43:55,312 --> 01:43:56,395
She's very sparkly.

1940
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:57,939
She looks like
a holiday.

1941
01:44:00,359 --> 01:44:01,609
I don't think I've heard
that one before.

1942
01:44:01,693 --> 01:44:02,902
Mr. Babbitt.

1943
01:44:02,986 --> 01:44:05,112
Mr. Kelso would like
to see you.

1944
01:44:05,572 --> 01:44:08,199
I don't know Mr. Kelso.
He's director of security.

1945
01:44:08,283 --> 01:44:09,909
Would you come
with me, please?

1946
01:44:09,993 --> 01:44:12,245
Sure. Listen, Susanna, why
don't you stay with Raymond?

1947
01:44:12,329 --> 01:44:13,746
Right this way, sir.

1948
01:44:30,180 --> 01:44:31,973
10:01. She's not here.

1949
01:44:32,057 --> 01:44:34,141
She'll come.
She will.

1950
01:44:43,735 --> 01:44:45,278
Congratulations, Mr. Babbitt.

1951
01:44:45,362 --> 01:44:47,947
Counting into a six-deck shoe
is quite a feat.

1952
01:44:48,031 --> 01:44:50,574
I'm afraid I don't understand
what you're talking about.

1953
01:44:50,659 --> 01:44:52,827
We make videotapes,
Mr. Babbitt,

1954
01:44:52,995 --> 01:44:54,537
and we analyze the tapes,

1955
01:44:54,621 --> 01:44:57,290
and we even share some of the
information with the other casinos.

1956
01:44:57,374 --> 01:44:59,667
These tapes suggest that
you should take your winnings

1957
01:44:59,751 --> 01:45:01,294
and leave the state.

1958
01:45:01,378 --> 01:45:03,379
Mr. Kelso, someone has
a good day at the tables

1959
01:45:03,463 --> 01:45:06,257
and you accuse them
of illegal activities?

1960
01:45:06,466 --> 01:45:08,342
Is this how you treat
all your guests?

1961
01:45:08,552 --> 01:45:10,970
All you have to do is
close your mouth and go home.

1962
01:45:11,054 --> 01:45:13,806
And those are the best odds
you're gonna see for a while.

1963
01:45:14,182 --> 01:45:15,224
I'd take 'em.

1964
01:45:24,901 --> 01:45:27,570
Did you want to dance
on your date, Ray? Yeah.

1965
01:45:27,946 --> 01:45:29,655
There'll be
other chances, Ray.

1966
01:45:29,823 --> 01:45:33,117
Many pretty girls would
love to dance with you. Yeah.

1967
01:45:33,201 --> 01:45:34,410
It's gonna be okay.
Yeah.

1968
01:45:51,428 --> 01:45:52,428
Uh-oh.

1969
01:45:52,763 --> 01:45:54,180
I like this music, Ray.

1970
01:45:54,264 --> 01:45:55,264
Elevator stopped.

1971
01:45:55,349 --> 01:45:56,682
It's okay.

1972
01:45:56,767 --> 01:45:58,059
You think you could
show me the way

1973
01:45:58,143 --> 01:45:59,685
you were going to
dance with Iris?

1974
01:45:59,770 --> 01:46:01,145
Yeah.
Yes?

1975
01:46:01,772 --> 01:46:03,397
Would you like
to dance with me?

1976
01:46:03,482 --> 01:46:04,940
Elevator's on hold.

1977
01:46:05,108 --> 01:46:06,609
It's okay. Give me this.
Yeah.

1978
01:46:11,114 --> 01:46:12,490
Show me. Show me how.

1979
01:46:12,574 --> 01:46:14,450
Yeah. Charlie Babbitt
taught me.

1980
01:46:14,743 --> 01:46:16,285
Charlie Babbitt?
Yeah.

1981
01:46:18,205 --> 01:46:19,789
Dancing in the elevator.

1982
01:46:21,249 --> 01:46:22,416
It's nice.

1983
01:46:25,587 --> 01:46:27,213
You're very good.

1984
01:46:40,602 --> 01:46:42,812
Iris missed
a beautiful dance.

1985
01:46:43,105 --> 01:46:44,230
Yeah.

1986
01:46:45,482 --> 01:46:47,483
And a kiss.
Yeah, and a kiss.

1987
01:46:48,402 --> 01:46:49,402
Have you ever
kissed a girl?

1988
01:46:49,486 --> 01:46:50,736
I don't know.

1989
01:46:52,614 --> 01:46:53,906
You don't know?

1990
01:46:56,201 --> 01:46:58,202
Open your mouth. Open.

1991
01:47:00,664 --> 01:47:01,747
Like this.

1992
01:47:01,832 --> 01:47:04,917
Like you are tasting
something very good

1993
01:47:05,544 --> 01:47:07,044
and very soft.

1994
01:47:11,174 --> 01:47:12,383
Like this.

1995
01:47:12,509 --> 01:47:13,801
Close your eyes.

1996
01:47:21,226 --> 01:47:22,768
It's okay, Ray.
Yeah.

1997
01:47:31,903 --> 01:47:33,320
How was that?

1998
01:47:33,405 --> 01:47:34,613
Wet.

1999
01:47:36,241 --> 01:47:37,283
Then we did it right.

2000
01:47:37,367 --> 01:47:38,868
Elevator's
definitely stuck.

2001
01:47:39,369 --> 01:47:40,870
No, it's not stuck.

2002
01:47:49,045 --> 01:47:50,754
Fred Astaire
and Ginger Rogers.

2003
01:47:52,716 --> 01:47:54,550
Like us.
Yeah, like us.

2004
01:47:55,719 --> 01:47:57,052
What did I
tell you, Ray?

2005
01:47:57,179 --> 01:47:59,013
I promised
you could drive, this is it.

2006
01:47:59,097 --> 01:48:01,056
At Wallbrook, I drive
slow on the driveway.

2007
01:48:01,141 --> 01:48:02,975
Charlie, this is okay?
He can drive?

2008
01:48:03,059 --> 01:48:04,310
Course,
I'm an excellent driver.

2009
01:48:04,686 --> 01:48:05,895
He's very good
in the driveway.

2010
01:49:04,120 --> 01:49:05,913
Ray, why don't you
get in the front seat?

2011
01:49:08,208 --> 01:49:10,793
So I'll wait to hear from you
after Raymond's meeting? Yeah.

2012
01:49:11,044 --> 01:49:12,878
Don't worry.
It's gonna be fine, okay?

2013
01:49:12,963 --> 01:49:14,213
Oh, yeah.

2014
01:49:14,297 --> 01:49:15,714
I'm nervous.
I know.

2015
01:49:15,799 --> 01:49:19,510
Listen, I'm glad... Happy. I'm
happy that you came to Vegas.

2016
01:49:19,594 --> 01:49:20,761
I know.

2017
01:49:23,181 --> 01:49:24,306
Ciao.

2018
01:49:26,101 --> 01:49:29,311
Ray, thank you for the
date in the elevator.

2019
01:49:29,521 --> 01:49:30,980
It was really nice.
Yeah.

2020
01:49:31,064 --> 01:49:32,106
Ciao.
Yeah.

2021
01:49:32,190 --> 01:49:33,315
Thank you for the what? What?

2022
01:49:33,441 --> 01:49:35,317
Nothing.
Something between us.

2023
01:49:35,652 --> 01:49:37,528
Between us?
Mmm-hmm, us.

2024
01:49:41,324 --> 01:49:42,533
Us, Ray?

2025
01:49:49,082 --> 01:49:50,249
Here we go, Ray.

2026
01:49:50,333 --> 01:49:51,584
This is your bedroom
up here.

2027
01:49:51,668 --> 01:49:52,793
Course,
there's no bed there.

2028
01:49:52,877 --> 01:49:54,211
Definitely no bed there.

2029
01:49:54,296 --> 01:49:57,006
Oh, no,
this is a magic bed, Ray.

2030
01:49:57,507 --> 01:49:59,216
You just watch and see.

2031
01:49:59,301 --> 01:50:00,759
We got the table
over here.

2032
01:50:00,844 --> 01:50:02,386
We got the television, Ray.

2033
01:50:02,596 --> 01:50:05,431
Went to the video store, I got
a little surprise for you, Ray.

2034
01:50:05,515 --> 01:50:07,057
I picked up
a video for you.

2035
01:50:08,435 --> 01:50:09,435
Don't start with that,
Ray.

2036
01:50:09,519 --> 01:50:10,853
This is...

2037
01:50:11,062 --> 01:50:12,396
It's not just
another place, Ray.

2038
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:14,523
This is...
This is my place.

2039
01:50:15,775 --> 01:50:17,860
That's the man's name.
That's whose name? Yes.

2040
01:50:18,028 --> 01:50:20,362
Who? The first baseman.
Who's on first.

2041
01:50:20,530 --> 01:50:22,072
You got a first baseman?

2042
01:50:22,365 --> 01:50:24,366
Who's
playing first? Absolutely.

2043
01:50:24,451 --> 01:50:26,535
When you pay off the
first baseman, who gets the money?

2044
01:50:26,620 --> 01:50:29,330
Every dollar of it.
Why not?

2045
01:50:29,414 --> 01:50:30,623
The man's entitled to it.
Who is?

2046
01:50:30,707 --> 01:50:31,707
Yes.

2047
01:50:32,375 --> 01:50:34,209
So who gets it?
Why shouldn't he?

2048
01:50:34,294 --> 01:50:36,128
Sometimes his wife
comes down and collects it.

2049
01:50:36,212 --> 01:50:37,713
Whose wife?
Yes.

2050
01:50:39,382 --> 01:50:41,008
After all, the man earns it. Who does?

2051
01:50:41,092 --> 01:50:42,301
Absolutely.

2052
01:50:42,802 --> 01:50:45,137
All I'm tryin' to find out is
what's the guy's name on first base?

2053
01:50:45,221 --> 01:50:47,723
No. What is
on second base.

2054
01:50:47,891 --> 01:50:49,475
This is funny, Ray. Don't
you think this is funny?

2055
01:50:49,559 --> 01:50:51,060
Yeah, this is funny.

2056
01:50:51,519 --> 01:50:53,062
I'm not changing nobody.

2057
01:50:53,146 --> 01:50:54,229
Where'd you
see this first?

2058
01:50:54,356 --> 01:50:56,315
Dad gave me a book
of baseball trivia.

2059
01:50:56,399 --> 01:50:58,525
Dad, huh? I'm not asking
you who's on second.

2060
01:50:58,652 --> 01:51:00,778
Guess it didn't read as
funny. Definitely not.

2061
01:51:01,613 --> 01:51:02,946
We're not talking
about him.

2062
01:51:03,740 --> 01:51:05,491
Hello, this is Dr. Bruner.

2063
01:51:05,575 --> 01:51:06,867
I'd like you to call me...

2064
01:51:07,577 --> 01:51:08,827
Yeah, what is it?

2065
01:51:08,995 --> 01:51:10,704
Oh, I thought
I got the machine.

2066
01:51:10,872 --> 01:51:11,997
No.

2067
01:51:12,082 --> 01:51:13,374
I just got into town,
and, as you know,

2068
01:51:13,458 --> 01:51:16,001
the psychological interview
is tomorrow, Charlie.

2069
01:51:16,294 --> 01:51:17,920
Yes, sir, I know that.

2070
01:51:18,004 --> 01:51:20,381
I thought we should
get together and talk.

2071
01:51:20,465 --> 01:51:23,050
I really think it might be in
your best interest to meet me.

2072
01:51:23,134 --> 01:51:24,176
All right.

2073
01:51:24,260 --> 01:51:25,344
When?

2074
01:51:25,428 --> 01:51:26,679
I'm at the Bonaventure.

2075
01:51:26,763 --> 01:51:28,263
How about tonight
at 8:30?

2076
01:51:51,037 --> 01:51:52,621
Tomorrow morning
you'll meet Dr. Marston

2077
01:51:52,747 --> 01:51:56,041
who's in charge of Raymond's
psychiatric evaluation. Yeah, I know.

2078
01:51:56,126 --> 01:51:58,752
I gave him boxes
of files on Raymond. Boxes.

2079
01:51:58,837 --> 01:52:00,045
Well, good luck.

2080
01:52:00,130 --> 01:52:01,714
Look, this isn't
a close call, son.

2081
01:52:01,798 --> 01:52:02,840
It's a formality.

2082
01:52:02,924 --> 01:52:04,717
Your brother's
a very disabled individual.

2083
01:52:04,801 --> 01:52:06,635
You trying to tell me that
Marston's gonna rule against me?

2084
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:07,720
Is that why
you called me up here?

2085
01:52:07,804 --> 01:52:10,389
No, I'm telling you it's always
been a lost cause, Charlie.

2086
01:52:10,473 --> 01:52:11,849
Then what is this about?
Why'd you call me?

2087
01:52:11,933 --> 01:52:14,935
Let me tell you something. Your father put
me in charge of all the money, all right?

2088
01:52:15,019 --> 01:52:16,019
Yeah.

2089
01:52:16,146 --> 01:52:18,939
And it doesn't matter whether or
not you win custody of Raymond.

2090
01:52:19,107 --> 01:52:20,733
I won't have to
pay you a dime.

2091
01:52:20,817 --> 01:52:22,609
It's at my discretion,
not the court's.

2092
01:52:22,861 --> 01:52:24,111
What, so you can't lose?

2093
01:52:24,195 --> 01:52:25,404
I can lose.

2094
01:52:25,488 --> 01:52:26,739
I can lose Raymond.

2095
01:52:26,823 --> 01:52:28,240
I happen to care
about your brother's life

2096
01:52:28,324 --> 01:52:29,658
and the treatment
he receives.

2097
01:52:29,826 --> 01:52:31,785
I made a commitment to your
father some 20 years ago,

2098
01:52:31,870 --> 01:52:33,954
and I'm not willing
to gamble with that.

2099
01:52:36,124 --> 01:52:37,332
What is this?

2100
01:52:37,417 --> 01:52:38,834
It's a very big check.

2101
01:52:42,547 --> 01:52:44,173
$250,000.

2102
01:52:44,591 --> 01:52:45,841
And no strings attached.

2103
01:52:46,342 --> 01:52:47,760
You just walk away, Charlie.

2104
01:52:49,053 --> 01:52:50,679
You know, this isn't
about you and me.

2105
01:52:51,473 --> 01:52:53,056
It's not about
winning or losing.

2106
01:52:55,977 --> 01:52:59,354
I asked you a week ago, why didn't
anyone ever tell me I had a brother?

2107
01:52:59,814 --> 01:53:01,023
You didn't have an answer.

2108
01:53:02,901 --> 01:53:04,026
I don't know.

2109
01:53:06,362 --> 01:53:07,613
It's funny,
I just realized

2110
01:53:07,697 --> 01:53:10,532
I'm not pissed off anymore my
father cut me out of his will.

2111
01:53:12,702 --> 01:53:14,203
You were his friend,
you probably knew he tried

2112
01:53:14,287 --> 01:53:16,413
to contact me a few times
over the years.

2113
01:53:17,165 --> 01:53:19,041
I never called him back.
I was a prick.

2114
01:53:19,125 --> 01:53:20,959
If he was my son,
didn't return my calls,

2115
01:53:21,044 --> 01:53:22,795
I'd have written him out.
Fuck him.

2116
01:53:22,879 --> 01:53:24,797
But it's not
about the money anymore.

2117
01:53:26,841 --> 01:53:30,010
It's about...
I just don't understand

2118
01:53:30,094 --> 01:53:31,678
why didn't he tell me
I had a brother?

2119
01:53:31,763 --> 01:53:32,971
Why didn't you tell me
I had a brother?

2120
01:53:33,056 --> 01:53:36,391
Why didn't anyone ever
tell me that I had a brother?

2121
01:53:38,228 --> 01:53:39,353
I mean...

2122
01:53:40,230 --> 01:53:44,233
Because it'd have been nice to know him
for more than just the past six days.

2123
01:55:09,193 --> 01:55:11,028
Ray! Ray! Ray! Ray!

2124
01:55:27,295 --> 01:55:29,087
Ray! Ray! Ray! Ray!

2125
01:55:29,172 --> 01:55:30,213
Ray!

2126
01:55:30,506 --> 01:55:31,715
Come on.

2127
01:55:31,966 --> 01:55:34,259
It stopped.
It's all right.

2128
01:55:41,809 --> 01:55:43,018
V- E-R-N.

2129
01:55:43,811 --> 01:55:45,187
Vern. Vern.

2130
01:55:46,022 --> 01:55:48,106
Main man.
My main man, Vern.

2131
01:55:49,734 --> 01:55:50,984
V- E-R-N.

2132
01:55:55,031 --> 01:55:56,031
Uh-oh.

2133
01:55:58,660 --> 01:56:00,327
My main man, Vern.

2134
01:56:03,289 --> 01:56:06,208
V- E-R-N. Vern. My main man.

2135
01:56:07,043 --> 01:56:09,127
All right, Ray, they got
raspberry, strawberry, blueberry,

2136
01:56:09,212 --> 01:56:11,296
Pink Caddie, whole-wheat,
Peachy Keen, beer nut,

2137
01:56:11,381 --> 01:56:14,257
Rocky Road, buckwheat,
Belly Buster, blueberry.

2138
01:56:14,342 --> 01:56:15,509
What kind of
pancakes you want, Ray?

2139
01:56:15,593 --> 01:56:17,344
Pancakes.
Yeah. What kind?

2140
01:56:17,428 --> 01:56:19,262
Pancakes.
Of course.

2141
01:56:19,347 --> 01:56:22,140
Course, maple syrup is supposed to
be on the table before the pancakes.

2142
01:56:22,225 --> 01:56:23,183
Ray.
Yeah.

2143
01:56:23,267 --> 01:56:24,309
Ta-da.

2144
01:56:27,438 --> 01:56:28,981
Charlie Babbitt
made a joke.

2145
01:56:29,065 --> 01:56:30,440
I made a joke, Ray.
Yeah.

2146
01:56:51,212 --> 01:56:52,838
Step back
a little bit, Ray.

2147
01:57:13,443 --> 01:57:14,609
Hello?

2148
01:57:16,112 --> 01:57:18,071
Why don't you go
sit down over there?

2149
01:57:22,410 --> 01:57:23,577
Hello?

2150
01:57:24,120 --> 01:57:25,871
This is not a legal
proceeding, Mr. Babbitt,

2151
01:57:25,955 --> 01:57:27,789
so there's no lawyers,
no judge present,

2152
01:57:27,874 --> 01:57:29,833
just the people
who care about Raymond.

2153
01:57:30,793 --> 01:57:32,669
Raymond, why don't you
have a seat over there?

2154
01:57:32,754 --> 01:57:34,421
Mr. Babbitt, why don't you go
to that side of the table?

2155
01:57:34,505 --> 01:57:36,214
Raymond, right here.
Have a seat.

2156
01:57:36,299 --> 01:57:38,675
Raymond, right here.
Take this seat, okay?

2157
01:57:38,760 --> 01:57:40,469
Ray, you can put your knapsack
on the floor.

2158
01:57:40,553 --> 01:57:43,180
I think this is a good opportunity
to be honest with one another.

2159
01:57:43,306 --> 01:57:45,849
And the TV. Ray, the TV. Yeah.

2160
01:57:45,933 --> 01:57:48,018
On the floor. I'm sorry. Yeah.

2161
01:57:48,186 --> 01:57:51,354
I don't know any easy way
to say this, Mr. Babbitt...

2162
01:57:51,564 --> 01:57:52,689
To say what?

2163
01:57:52,774 --> 01:57:55,192
Have I lost already?
No, you haven't lost.

2164
01:57:55,318 --> 01:57:58,653
I'm not the judge and jury. I'm just a
doctor making a recommendation to a court.

2165
01:57:58,738 --> 01:57:59,946
Now, I must tell you
that Dr. Bruner

2166
01:58:00,031 --> 01:58:02,115
is a very respected
professional.

2167
01:58:02,200 --> 01:58:04,993
Raymond's case has been meticulously
documented over the years,

2168
01:58:05,078 --> 01:58:08,163
and, of course, Wallbrook is one of the
finest institutions we have in this country.

2169
01:58:08,331 --> 01:58:10,540
Boy, you guys have already made up
your mind. I'll see you in court.

2170
01:58:10,625 --> 01:58:11,583
Hold on, son.
No one's your enemy.

2171
01:58:11,667 --> 01:58:13,251
My brother came further
with me in a week

2172
01:58:13,336 --> 01:58:15,087
than he did with you in 20
years. And that's the truth.

2173
01:58:15,171 --> 01:58:17,089
I don't think... You don't
know anything about us!

2174
01:58:17,173 --> 01:58:19,174
I don't think it's necessary
to challenge Dr. Bruner.

2175
01:58:19,258 --> 01:58:20,592
I'm sorry.
All right.

2176
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:22,719
Exactly what happened
this past week, Raymond?

2177
01:58:22,804 --> 01:58:25,180
Well, we got...
I was asking Raymond.

2178
01:58:25,681 --> 01:58:27,849
Raymond, what happened
this past week?

2179
01:58:29,018 --> 01:58:30,936
What did you do, Raymond?
Counted cards.

2180
01:58:31,020 --> 01:58:33,021
Counted cards? Counted
cards in Las Vegas.

2181
01:58:33,106 --> 01:58:34,564
Your brother
took you to Las Vegas?

2182
01:58:34,649 --> 01:58:36,858
$3,000 on
the wheel of fortune.

2183
01:58:37,193 --> 01:58:39,111
He gave you $3,000
to gamble with?

2184
01:58:39,195 --> 01:58:42,364
Lost $3,000 on pitiful 20.

2185
01:58:42,448 --> 01:58:44,699
What else did you do?
Bet on number 20.

2186
01:58:44,784 --> 01:58:46,243
What else did you do?

2187
01:58:46,327 --> 01:58:47,828
Danced with
Charlie Babbitt.

2188
01:58:47,954 --> 01:58:49,830
Danced with your brother? He
wanted to learn how to dance

2189
01:58:49,956 --> 01:58:51,706
so I taught him. Danced in
the elevator with Susanna.

2190
01:58:51,791 --> 01:58:52,958
Kissed Susanna.

2191
01:58:53,042 --> 01:58:55,168
Kissed Susanna?
Yeah. In the elevator.

2192
01:58:55,253 --> 01:58:56,837
Did you enjoy
kissing a woman?

2193
01:58:57,130 --> 01:58:58,255
I don't know.

2194
01:58:58,381 --> 01:58:59,381
How did it feel?

2195
01:58:59,549 --> 01:59:00,674
It felt wet.

2196
01:59:00,758 --> 01:59:01,842
Wet?
Yeah.

2197
01:59:02,385 --> 01:59:03,844
Quite a trip, huh?
Yeah.

2198
01:59:05,638 --> 01:59:06,805
You enjoy
being on the road?

2199
01:59:06,889 --> 01:59:08,181
I'm an excellent driver.

2200
01:59:08,266 --> 01:59:09,599
You drove?
Yeah.

2201
01:59:10,393 --> 01:59:12,644
Your brother let you drive on
the highway? The interstate?

2202
01:59:12,728 --> 01:59:13,895
Yeah, slow on the driveway.

2203
01:59:13,980 --> 01:59:15,730
He didn't drive
on the highway.

2204
01:59:17,900 --> 01:59:19,484
Did he have any emotional
outbursts this past week?

2205
01:59:19,569 --> 01:59:20,569
What do you mean?

2206
01:59:20,653 --> 01:59:22,279
Well,
things they tend to do.

2207
01:59:22,530 --> 01:59:24,489
Inflicting bodily harm
on themselves...

2208
01:59:24,574 --> 01:59:26,992
Okay, yeah, a couple of times.
A couple of times?

2209
01:59:27,076 --> 01:59:29,578
Okay, he had what you call
an outburst at the airport

2210
01:59:29,662 --> 01:59:32,164
because he didn't want to fly,
so we didn't fly.

2211
01:59:32,248 --> 01:59:33,790
When was the last outburst
that he had?

2212
01:59:33,875 --> 01:59:36,251
This morning.
This morning?

2213
01:59:36,335 --> 01:59:39,713
This is bullshit. Because I could tell
you anything, I could tell you nothing,

2214
01:59:39,797 --> 01:59:41,089
and you'd never
know the difference.

2215
01:59:41,174 --> 01:59:43,216
This morning
the smoke alarm went off.

2216
01:59:43,301 --> 01:59:45,010
He got a little nervous,
but he's fine.

2217
01:59:45,094 --> 01:59:47,888
Don't feel as though
I'm placing any blame.

2218
01:59:47,972 --> 01:59:49,264
We went out for pancakes.

2219
01:59:49,307 --> 01:59:52,142
Look at him, he's fine. You
don't have to be defensive.

2220
01:59:52,268 --> 01:59:53,727
I'm not challenging you. I'm
just being honest with you.

2221
01:59:53,811 --> 01:59:55,270
You're missing the point.
You're missing the point.

2222
01:59:55,354 --> 01:59:56,646
I'm being truthful about this.

2223
01:59:56,731 --> 01:59:59,441
The point I was trying to make
is I'm not placing any blame...

2224
01:59:59,525 --> 02:00:01,735
I had a father I hardly knew,
a mother I didn't know at all,

2225
02:00:01,819 --> 02:00:03,528
I find out a few days ago
that I have a brother,

2226
02:00:03,613 --> 02:00:05,530
and I wanna be with him and
I'm supposed to give him up?

2227
02:00:05,615 --> 02:00:07,282
No one is
saying anything...

2228
02:00:07,366 --> 02:00:09,409
I didn't hurt him,
he's not hurting me,

2229
02:00:09,493 --> 02:00:12,245
we're not hurting you. Now, why are
you interfering? This is my family.

2230
02:00:12,371 --> 02:00:14,331
I'm not interfering. This is my
family. Do you understand that?

2231
02:00:14,415 --> 02:00:15,457
I understand that.

2232
02:00:15,541 --> 02:00:16,583
Yes, you do have a brother,

2233
02:00:16,667 --> 02:00:19,794
but the point is he's not capable
of having a relationship with you.

2234
02:00:19,962 --> 02:00:22,923
That's your opinion. Did you spend 24
hours a day, seven days a week with him?

2235
02:00:23,007 --> 02:00:24,132
Have you ever done that?

2236
02:00:24,300 --> 02:00:25,967
Look, you cannot take
on the responsibility

2237
02:00:26,052 --> 02:00:27,302
of your brother
without professional guidance.

2238
02:00:27,386 --> 02:00:28,720
That's your opinion,
Dr. Bruner.

2239
02:00:28,804 --> 02:00:30,263
Yes, it's my opinion.

2240
02:00:30,348 --> 02:00:32,140
There's a couple of things I'd
like to go over in this file.

2241
02:00:32,225 --> 02:00:36,019
Dr. Bruner states a week ago you
stole Raymond out of the institution

2242
02:00:36,103 --> 02:00:38,855
and you're willing to trade him
for $1.5 million. Is that correct?

2243
02:00:38,940 --> 02:00:40,899
My father died. I was upset.

2244
02:00:40,983 --> 02:00:42,525
Okay? That was wrong.
Okay.

2245
02:00:42,610 --> 02:00:43,902
So last week you were upset,

2246
02:00:43,986 --> 02:00:46,363
and then this week you suddenly
found some devotion to your brother

2247
02:00:46,447 --> 02:00:48,615
and you want to take care
of him the rest of your life?

2248
02:00:48,699 --> 02:00:49,950
Yes.

2249
02:00:50,993 --> 02:00:53,328
So in the beginning,
it was like a kidnapping.

2250
02:00:54,080 --> 02:00:55,997
Kidnapping...
That's very strong.

2251
02:00:56,082 --> 02:00:57,457
I didn't kidnap my brother.

2252
02:00:57,541 --> 02:01:00,377
But in the course of the week, you
came to have an understanding with him.

2253
02:01:00,878 --> 02:01:01,962
Yes.

2254
02:01:02,088 --> 02:01:03,296
Look, that...

2255
02:01:03,798 --> 02:01:04,965
Yes?
When we...

2256
02:01:05,049 --> 02:01:07,384
I understand that this
sounds irrational to you.

2257
02:01:07,468 --> 02:01:09,636
Yes, when it started out,
it had...

2258
02:01:09,720 --> 02:01:11,721
Don't feel compelled
to be defensive about that.

2259
02:01:11,806 --> 02:01:12,806
Can I talk?
Yes, you can.

2260
02:01:12,932 --> 02:01:15,517
I'd like to talk.
Thank you. Yes, you can.

2261
02:01:15,601 --> 02:01:16,977
There's no accusations.

2262
02:01:17,061 --> 02:01:18,228
Go ahead.

2263
02:01:18,354 --> 02:01:19,521
There's no accusations?

2264
02:01:21,607 --> 02:01:25,193
See, you have to understand that
when we started out together,

2265
02:01:25,278 --> 02:01:27,487
that he was
only my brother

2266
02:01:28,155 --> 02:01:29,364
in name.

2267
02:01:33,494 --> 02:01:34,869
And as...

2268
02:01:38,374 --> 02:01:40,458
Then this morning
we had pancakes.

2269
02:01:40,543 --> 02:01:41,501
Maple syrup.

2270
02:01:41,585 --> 02:01:43,003
Maple syrup on the...

2271
02:01:43,087 --> 02:01:45,088
Maple syrup on the table.
And pancakes.

2272
02:01:45,172 --> 02:01:47,215
And Charlie Babbitt
made a joke.

2273
02:01:49,218 --> 02:01:50,385
You see, we...

2274
02:01:51,887 --> 02:01:53,430
I made a connection.

2275
02:01:54,015 --> 02:01:55,682
I think that's very admirable
that you made a connection,

2276
02:01:55,766 --> 02:01:58,059
but I think the purpose of
this meeting is to determine

2277
02:01:58,144 --> 02:01:59,477
what is best for Raymond.

2278
02:01:59,562 --> 02:02:02,480
Whether or not he's capable of
functioning in the community,

2279
02:02:02,565 --> 02:02:03,898
and what, in fact,
he wants,

2280
02:02:03,983 --> 02:02:05,942
if that's possible
to determine.

2281
02:02:06,110 --> 02:02:07,235
I'm all for that.

2282
02:02:07,361 --> 02:02:09,696
Raymond's unable to make
those kind of decisions.

2283
02:02:09,780 --> 02:02:10,780
You're wrong.

2284
02:02:10,865 --> 02:02:12,615
Charlie, you know
he can't decide for himself.

2285
02:02:12,700 --> 02:02:14,993
He's capable of
a lot more than you know.

2286
02:02:15,077 --> 02:02:17,620
Why don't we ask Raymond?
Maybe we can find a few answers.

2287
02:02:18,164 --> 02:02:20,457
Raymond, can I ask you
a few questions?

2288
02:02:21,417 --> 02:02:23,043
Ray, the doctor's talking to you. Yeah?

2289
02:02:23,127 --> 02:02:24,919
Raymond, can I ask you
a few questions? Yeah.

2290
02:02:27,715 --> 02:02:29,758
Do you want to stay
with your brother Charlie?

2291
02:02:30,926 --> 02:02:33,970
Raymond, would you like to stay with
your brother Charlie in Los Angeles?

2292
02:02:34,055 --> 02:02:36,556
Ray, the doctor's
asking you a question,

2293
02:02:36,682 --> 02:02:38,892
so you listen, okay, Ray? Yeah.

2294
02:02:38,976 --> 02:02:41,603
Raymond, do you want to stay
with your brother Charlie?

2295
02:02:42,938 --> 02:02:46,149
Raymond, do you want to stay
with your brother Charlie? Yeah.

2296
02:02:46,233 --> 02:02:47,734
You do?
Yeah.

2297
02:02:48,444 --> 02:02:50,653
You want to stay with
your brother? Yeah.

2298
02:02:51,030 --> 02:02:53,031
Stay with my brother,
Charlie Babbitt.

2299
02:02:53,115 --> 02:02:54,699
That's what you want? Yeah.

2300
02:02:56,869 --> 02:02:59,287
You want to stay with
your brother? Yeah.

2301
02:03:02,792 --> 02:03:05,001
Can I ask you something
else, Raymond? Yeah.

2302
02:03:05,628 --> 02:03:07,337
Do you want to go back
to Wallbrook? Yeah.

2303
02:03:08,798 --> 02:03:11,883
Raymond, can you make a distinction
between your brother and Wallbrook?

2304
02:03:12,134 --> 02:03:13,176
Yeah.

2305
02:03:16,097 --> 02:03:17,680
Do you want to
stay with your brother Charlie

2306
02:03:17,765 --> 02:03:19,682
here in Los Angeles?
Yeah.

2307
02:03:19,809 --> 02:03:21,768
Or do you wanna go
back to Wallbrook? Yeah.

2308
02:03:22,978 --> 02:03:26,064
Two separate things, stay with your
brother or go back to Wallbrook?

2309
02:03:26,148 --> 02:03:27,732
It's not one thing, Raymond.

2310
02:03:27,817 --> 02:03:29,192
This is your brother.
You make a choice.

2311
02:03:29,276 --> 02:03:30,902
Back to Wallbrook,
stay with Charlie Babbitt.

2312
02:03:30,986 --> 02:03:31,986
Okay.

2313
02:03:32,071 --> 02:03:33,780
Back to Wallbrook, stay with
my brother Charlie Babbitt.

2314
02:03:33,864 --> 02:03:35,532
No, no, no. Two separate
things. Can you make that choice?

2315
02:03:35,658 --> 02:03:37,534
One or the other. Yeah,
go back to Wallbrook...

2316
02:03:37,618 --> 02:03:38,993
All right.

2317
02:03:39,036 --> 02:03:42,372
Stay back at Wallbrook.
Hold on. Just hold on!

2318
02:03:42,456 --> 02:03:44,499
Stay back at Wallbrook.
All right.

2319
02:03:45,126 --> 02:03:48,420
You made your point. Okay? You
don't have to humiliate him.

2320
02:03:48,504 --> 02:03:51,589
Ray, it's okay. It's over.

2321
02:03:51,674 --> 02:03:52,966
Yeah.

2322
02:03:53,050 --> 02:03:55,135
Stay back at Wallbrook
with Charlie Babbitt.

2323
02:03:56,178 --> 02:03:57,595
Stay back at Wallbrook.

2324
02:03:57,680 --> 02:03:58,805
It's over.

2325
02:03:59,056 --> 02:04:00,640
Raymond?
Yeah.

2326
02:04:04,270 --> 02:04:05,770
Dr. Bruner, can I talk
to you for a minute?

2327
02:04:05,855 --> 02:04:07,564
Of course.
Excuse me.

2328
02:04:16,157 --> 02:04:17,949
You okay, Ray?
Yeah.

2329
02:04:20,453 --> 02:04:22,787
You don't want any more
questions, do you? No.

2330
02:04:23,956 --> 02:04:24,956
No.

2331
02:04:26,208 --> 02:04:27,667
I don't know.

2332
02:04:33,424 --> 02:04:35,925
You don't want any more questions,
do you? No more questions.

2333
02:04:36,010 --> 02:04:37,010
No.

2334
02:04:40,931 --> 02:04:43,099
Don't worry. There's not gonna
be any more questions, okay?

2335
02:04:43,225 --> 02:04:45,518
Yeah. No more questions. I'll
make sure of that, okay, Ray?

2336
02:04:45,603 --> 02:04:47,145
Yeah. Main man.

2337
02:04:48,397 --> 02:04:50,148
What?
My main man.

2338
02:04:55,237 --> 02:04:56,529
Listen...

2339
02:05:00,409 --> 02:05:02,994
Ray, I don't know if I'm gonna
have a chance to talk to you again.

2340
02:05:07,082 --> 02:05:08,708
Because you see, these...

2341
02:05:09,710 --> 02:05:11,169
Dr. Bruner really
likes you a lot,

2342
02:05:11,295 --> 02:05:14,297
and he's probably gonna want
to take you back with him.

2343
02:05:14,924 --> 02:05:16,424
You know?
Yeah.

2344
02:05:18,636 --> 02:05:19,719
But I just want you to know

2345
02:05:19,803 --> 02:05:23,014
that what I said about being
on the road with you, I meant.

2346
02:05:23,933 --> 02:05:25,308
Connecting.

2347
02:05:26,977 --> 02:05:28,561
I like having you
for my brother.

2348
02:05:28,646 --> 02:05:30,605
I'm an excellent driver.

2349
02:05:32,900 --> 02:05:34,192
Yes, you are.

2350
02:06:01,595 --> 02:06:03,471
I like having you
for my big brother.

2351
02:06:06,850 --> 02:06:07,850
Yeah.

2352
02:06:22,700 --> 02:06:24,659
C- H-A-R-L-I-E.

2353
02:06:28,455 --> 02:06:30,790
C- H-A-R-L-I-E.

2354
02:06:32,167 --> 02:06:33,418
Main man.

2355
02:07:07,286 --> 02:07:09,203
May I
have your attention, please?

2356
02:07:09,288 --> 02:07:13,499
Amtrak train number 36,
the Desert Wind, eastbound,

2357
02:07:13,584 --> 02:07:15,918
now boarding,
track number three.

2358
02:07:16,462 --> 02:07:17,587
Fullerton, San Bernardino...

2359
02:07:17,671 --> 02:07:18,671
Ray.

2360
02:07:19,298 --> 02:07:23,718
...Las Vegas, Salt Lake City,
Denver, Omaha, Chicago.

2361
02:07:30,392 --> 02:07:32,810
Hello, Charlie. Hello,
Raymond. Dr. Bruner.

2362
02:07:32,936 --> 02:07:36,272
Wouldn't you feel a little more
relaxed in your favorite Kmart clothes?

2363
02:07:36,357 --> 02:07:37,982
Tell him, Ray.
Kmart sucks.

2364
02:07:38,067 --> 02:07:39,150
I see.

2365
02:07:39,234 --> 02:07:43,071
I have the tickets, and I'll be on
this car right here to the right.

2366
02:07:43,739 --> 02:07:45,281
Why don't you take
a couple of minutes?

2367
02:07:45,366 --> 02:07:46,699
See you, Charlie.

2368
02:07:48,410 --> 02:07:50,078
You made a joke, Ray.
Yeah.

2369
02:07:56,460 --> 02:07:58,169
I guess I better
give this to you.

2370
02:07:58,253 --> 02:08:00,588
You're gonna have to
carry this now, it's...

2371
02:08:01,590 --> 02:08:03,966
It's got your cheese balls,
your apple juice,

2372
02:08:04,968 --> 02:08:06,969
notebooks, pens and...

2373
02:08:07,096 --> 02:08:09,514
"Who's on First" video
that you like.

2374
02:08:09,598 --> 02:08:11,349
"Who's on First. "
Very funny.

2375
02:08:11,433 --> 02:08:12,892
I told you it's funny.

2376
02:08:12,976 --> 02:08:14,143
Board!

2377
02:08:15,104 --> 02:08:16,145
Better get going.

2378
02:08:16,230 --> 02:08:17,480
Yeah. Very shiny train.

2379
02:08:17,564 --> 02:08:19,190
Yeah, it sure is.

2380
02:08:20,234 --> 02:08:23,194
Listen, Ray, Dr. Bruner
only has custody of you.

2381
02:08:23,278 --> 02:08:25,780
That doesn't mean
I can't visit.

2382
02:08:26,156 --> 02:08:28,908
Now, I'm coming
to see you in two weeks.

2383
02:08:29,118 --> 02:08:30,827
How many days is that before
we're gonna be together?

2384
02:08:30,911 --> 02:08:33,121
14 days from today.
Today's Wednesday.

2385
02:08:33,247 --> 02:08:34,455
Hours?

2386
02:08:34,623 --> 02:08:36,416
336 hours.

2387
02:08:37,084 --> 02:08:38,459
Mystifying.

2388
02:08:39,461 --> 02:08:41,546
Course,
that's 20, 160 minutes.

2389
02:08:41,630 --> 02:08:44,716
1,209,600...

2390
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:46,217
600 seconds.

2391
02:08:46,969 --> 02:08:48,052
Ray?

2392
02:08:49,763 --> 02:08:51,097
Ray?

2393
02:08:51,807 --> 02:08:52,807
Ray?

2394
02:08:54,351 --> 02:08:55,351
Yeah.

2395
02:09:00,482 --> 02:09:02,024
I'll see you soon.

2396
02:09:02,317 --> 02:09:04,610
Yeah. One for bad,
two for good.

2397
02:09:09,074 --> 02:09:11,534
Bet two for good.
Yeah.

2398
02:09:22,755 --> 02:09:24,714
Course, three minutes
to Wapner.

2399
02:09:25,966 --> 02:09:27,508
You'll make it.

2400
02:09:29,178 --> 02:09:30,428
Yeah.
