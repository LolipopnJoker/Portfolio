00:00:59,358 --> 00:01:03,571
Put your faith
in what you most believe in

3
00:01:03,738 --> 00:01:08,158
Two worlds
One family

4
00:01:08,283 --> 00:01:11,955
Trust your heart
Let fate decide

5
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,500
To guide these lives we see

6
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:21,171
A paradise
untouched by man

7
00:01:21,339 --> 00:01:24,968
Within this world
blessed with love

8
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:30,013
A simple life
They live in peace

9
00:01:30,138 --> 00:01:34,477
Softly tread the sand
below your feet now

10
00:01:34,602 --> 00:01:38,188
Two worlds
One family

11
00:01:38,313 --> 00:01:42,861
Trust your heart
Let fate decide

12
00:01:43,027 --> 00:01:47,406
To guide these lives we see

13
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:51,994
Beneath the shelter
of the trees

14
00:01:52,161 --> 00:01:56,540
Only love can enter here

15
00:01:56,708 --> 00:02:00,837
A simple life
They live in peace

16
00:02:00,962 --> 00:02:04,548
Raise your head up
Lift high the load

17
00:02:04,673 --> 00:02:08,636
Take strength
from those that need you

18
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:13,057
Build high the walls
Build strong the beams

19
00:02:13,183 --> 00:02:19,397
A new life is waiting
But danger's no stranger here

20
00:02:43,713 --> 00:02:47,884
No words describe
a mother's tears

21
00:02:48,051 --> 00:02:53,096
No words can heal
a broken heart

22
00:02:53,263 --> 00:02:56,558
- A dream is gone
But where there's hope

23
00:02:56,683 --> 00:03:01,272
Somewhere something
is calling for you

24
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,733
Two worlds
One family

25
00:03:04,858 --> 00:03:09,112
Trust your heart
Let fate decide

26
00:03:09,279 --> 00:03:14,076
To guide these lives we see

27
00:04:52,966 --> 00:04:55,886
- Huh?
- Eh?

28
00:05:01,559 --> 00:05:03,352
Achoo!

29
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,715
Agh!

30
00:07:17,194 --> 00:07:21,114
Anh-anh-anh-anh.

31
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:55,566
Every moment now
the bond grows stronger

32
00:07:55,691 --> 00:07:59,069
- Two worlds, one family

33
00:07:59,194 --> 00:08:03,490
Trust your heart
Let fate decide

34
00:08:03,658 --> 00:08:08,496
To guide these lives we see

35
00:08:18,756 --> 00:08:20,716
Mommy, look!
Look over there!

36
00:08:20,841 --> 00:08:22,677
Kala, she's back!

37
00:08:27,973 --> 00:08:29,725
Are you all right,
dear?

38
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,518
I'm fine.
No, really, honestly.

39
00:08:31,686 --> 00:08:35,272
It's just that I got
a little bit... sidetracked.

40
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,236
Well, isn't that, uh...
Well, so...

41
00:08:40,402 --> 00:08:43,323
Well,
it's just so, so...

42
00:08:43,448 --> 00:08:45,782
That's freaky-lookin', okay?
That's what it is.

43
00:08:45,949 --> 00:08:47,785
- Terkina!
- Well, it is!

44
00:08:47,952 --> 00:08:51,622
- I mean, what the heck is it anyway?
- He's a baby.

45
00:08:51,747 --> 00:08:55,209
Ow! I can't...

46
00:08:56,627 --> 00:08:59,963
- So, where's his mama?

47
00:09:00,131 --> 00:09:02,967
Well, I'm going to be
his mother now.

48
00:09:08,097 --> 00:09:11,851
You know, he's not so bad
once you get used to him.

49
00:09:12,809 --> 00:09:15,896
Kala's gonna be its mother now.

50
00:09:19,983 --> 00:09:23,947
- Kerchak, I saved him from Sabor.

51
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:29,827
Kala, it won't replace
the one we lost.

52
00:09:29,993 --> 00:09:33,830
I know that.
But... he needs me.

53
00:09:33,997 --> 00:09:38,670
But, it-it-it...
Kala, look at it.

54
00:09:38,835 --> 00:09:41,046
It's not our kind.

55
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:45,008
No. You have to take it back.

56
00:09:45,133 --> 00:09:47,886
Take him back?
But he'll die!

57
00:09:48,011 --> 00:09:50,180
- If the jungle wants him...
- I want him.

58
00:09:50,348 --> 00:09:52,559
Kala, I cannot let you put
our family in danger.

59
00:09:52,684 --> 00:09:55,395
- Does he look dangerous to you?

60
00:10:02,986 --> 00:10:06,322
Hmm. Was it alone?

61
00:10:06,488 --> 00:10:08,824
Yes.
Sabor killed his family.

62
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:12,996
- Are you sure?
- Yes. There are no others.

63
00:10:13,121 --> 00:10:17,250
Then you may keep him.

64
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:22,881
- Kerchak, I know he'll be a good son.
- I said he could stay.

65
00:10:23,046 --> 00:10:25,842
That doesn't make him
my son.

66
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:31,097
We will nest here
for the night.

67
00:10:36,352 --> 00:10:39,021
So, um,
whatcha gonna call it?

68
00:10:39,189 --> 00:10:42,900
I'm gonna call him...
Tarzan.

69
00:10:43,025 --> 00:10:46,612
Tarzan? Okay.
He's your baby.

70
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:49,907
All right, little lady, come on.
It's way past your nest time.

71
00:10:50,032 --> 00:10:51,950
- Oh, Mom, five more minutes?
- No!

72
00:10:52,117 --> 00:10:54,286
- Two more minutes?
- No!

73
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:57,122
One more "minutes"?

74
00:11:01,084 --> 00:11:02,878
Oh, no, no, no.

75
00:11:03,045 --> 00:11:06,591
- Shh, shh, shh. Don't cry. I'm here.

76
00:11:06,716 --> 00:11:09,260
Come on, come on.

77
00:11:09,426 --> 00:11:13,264
Come, stop your crying
It'll be all right

78
00:11:13,389 --> 00:11:19,270
Just take my hand
Hold it tight

79
00:11:19,436 --> 00:11:24,067
I will protect you
from all around you

80
00:11:24,192 --> 00:11:29,155
I will be here
Don't you cry

81
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:34,452
For one so small
You seem so strong

82
00:11:34,618 --> 00:11:38,622
My arms will hold you
Keep you safe and warm

83
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:44,253
This bond between us
can't be broken

84
00:11:44,378 --> 00:11:48,341
I will be here
Don't you cry

85
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:53,011
ґCause you'll be in my heart

86
00:11:53,136 --> 00:11:57,099
Yes, you'll be in my heart

87
00:11:57,266 --> 00:12:04,439
From this day on
Now and forever more

88
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:12,323
You'll be in my heart

89
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:17,160
No matter what they say

90
00:12:17,328 --> 00:12:21,875
You'll be here in my heart

91
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,585
Always

92
00:12:28,298 --> 00:12:30,883
Always.

93
00:12:47,858 --> 00:12:49,819
Mmm.

94
00:12:52,697 --> 00:12:56,159
Tarzan?

95
00:12:56,325 --> 00:13:01,372
- Tarzan?

96
00:13:01,539 --> 00:13:05,709
- I sure scared you, Mom. Whoa.
- You sure did!

97
00:13:05,834 --> 00:13:08,170
Can't you imitate
any quieter animals?

98
00:13:08,295 --> 00:13:11,716
Oh, Mom, they're no fun.
Wanna see me be a leopard?

99
00:13:13,885 --> 00:13:16,846
- Why don't you just come up
with your own sound?

100
00:13:17,012 --> 00:13:18,223
Mmm.

101
00:13:21,351 --> 00:13:24,896
- Kala!

102
00:13:29,317 --> 00:13:32,402
- Oops.

103
00:13:32,569 --> 00:13:34,405
Hee-hee.

104
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,907
Tarzan, thank goodness
you're all right!

105
00:13:37,074 --> 00:13:40,786
Kala and I have been
so worried!

106
00:13:40,911 --> 00:13:44,207
Thank you. Thank you so much
for finding him, Kerchak.

107
00:13:44,373 --> 00:13:46,751
You are such a wise
and caring leader.

108
00:13:46,876 --> 00:13:48,962
Run.

109
00:13:49,127 --> 00:13:51,421
Ooh!
Um...

110
00:13:53,507 --> 00:13:56,261
Hello!
Are you thick in the head?

111
00:13:56,426 --> 00:13:58,262
- What?
- How many times do I have to tell ya?

112
00:13:58,387 --> 00:14:02,099
If you want Kerchak to like you,
stay away from him!

113
00:14:02,266 --> 00:14:04,935
- Come on, Terk! Step on it!
- Last one there's a dung beetle!

114
00:14:05,102 --> 00:14:08,731
- Yeah! And the first one's
gotta eat it!
- Terk, can I come?

115
00:14:08,897 --> 00:14:13,026
Well, yeah, you could if you could keep
up, but... you can't really keep up.

116
00:14:13,194 --> 00:14:17,240
Wait up, guys.
Wait up! Right behind ya.

117
00:14:26,123 --> 00:14:28,793
Ah, yeah, take that.
Stop hitting yourself.

118
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,755
- Stop hitting yourself!
Stop hitting yourself!
- Ow! Ow!

119
00:14:32,921 --> 00:14:36,800
The fun has arrived
Thank you very much.

120
00:14:36,925 --> 00:14:38,468
What took you
so long?

121
00:14:38,636 --> 00:14:43,183
I had a little pest control problem,
but it's all taken care of.

122
00:14:43,348 --> 00:14:45,517
Hi, guys.

123
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:48,771
Terk, what is this?
Some kind of joke?

124
00:14:48,938 --> 00:14:51,315
Tell me I'm not
lookinґ at the hairless wonder.

125
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,276
Terk said I could come along
if I could keep up.

126
00:14:55,819 --> 00:14:57,530
- Ah, no, Terk, come on!
- Terk!

127
00:14:57,655 --> 00:15:00,617
I'll handle this, guys.
Okay?

128
00:15:00,782 --> 00:15:05,078
Listen, buddy, come here. We got a tiny,
little, itsy-bitsy problem here.

129
00:15:05,246 --> 00:15:08,082
Personally, I'd love to hang out
with you. You know I would.

130
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:11,335
But the guys, they need
a little convincing, you know.

131
00:15:11,501 --> 00:15:13,045
Okay.
What do I gotta do?

132
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:17,342
Do? What do you gotta do?
It's so stupid!

133
00:15:17,467 --> 00:15:23,305
- What?
- Well, you gotta...
You gotta go get a hair.

134
00:15:23,473 --> 00:15:25,224
A hair?

135
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:27,977
- Yeah, a hair. Uh-huh.

136
00:15:28,144 --> 00:15:30,396
An elephant hair.

137
00:15:34,275 --> 00:15:36,527
An elephant hair?

138
00:15:36,652 --> 00:15:39,530
Like I said,
it's stupid, right?

139
00:15:39,655 --> 00:15:42,242
Listen, take it from me.
Go home, okay?

140
00:15:42,367 --> 00:15:47,038
Who needs this aggravation? You know?
I'm probably gonna leave soon myself.

141
00:15:47,204 --> 00:15:50,040
You go, I'll catch up.
All right?

142
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:54,045
You see? Leave it to me.
I told ya... Tarzan!

143
00:15:54,212 --> 00:15:56,506
- Tarzan, no!

144
00:16:04,012 --> 00:16:07,099
- That one hurt him.

145
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:25,577
Look!

146
00:16:25,742 --> 00:16:29,747
Oh, oh, there he is! He's alive!
- Hey, guys!

147
00:16:29,914 --> 00:16:31,540
Hi!

148
00:16:31,665 --> 00:16:34,544
Oh, no. No, no, no!

149
00:16:34,669 --> 00:16:37,713
Come back!
Come back!

150
00:16:37,881 --> 00:16:42,135
This guy's great! If he lives,
you should bring him around more often.

151
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:45,597
- Come on, let's go get a better seat.
- Ohh.

152
00:16:48,473 --> 00:16:50,977
- You never get enough sleep.
- I get enough sleep.

153
00:16:51,102 --> 00:16:55,814
Mom, are you sure
this water's sanitary?

154
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:58,943
It looks questionable to me.

155
00:16:59,109 --> 00:17:01,069
It's fine, honey.

156
00:17:01,237 --> 00:17:05,200
Yech!
But what about bacteria?

157
00:17:05,366 --> 00:17:08,953
Tantor, can't you see
Mommy's talking?

158
00:17:13,124 --> 00:17:17,587
Watch out! There's something
swimming! It's coming right at you!

159
00:17:17,753 --> 00:17:20,048
Honey, Mommy's losing
her patience.

160
00:17:20,214 --> 00:17:23,342
- But this time I really see something!
- Oh, boy.

161
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,678
Piranha! It's a piranha!

162
00:17:26,803 --> 00:17:30,015
Sweetheart, there are
no piranhas in Africa.

163
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:33,520
Don't tell the kid that. Of course
there are piranhas in Africa.

164
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:36,188
No, she's right.
They're native to South America.

165
00:17:36,313 --> 00:17:38,899
Get outta here.
No way!

166
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:41,235
Come on. Do you think I'd be
standing here if there were?

167
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,280
Aah! It's right behind you!
Run!

168
00:17:44,405 --> 00:17:49,702
- For the last time, honey,
there are no piranhas in... - My butt!

169
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:53,039
- I told you!
- There's something on my butt.

170
00:17:53,164 --> 00:17:55,791
- What is it?
- Are there any more of them?

171
00:17:55,959 --> 00:17:57,585
Ahh!

172
00:17:57,751 --> 00:18:01,463
- What is it?
- It's a piranha!

173
00:18:02,005 --> 00:18:03,758
Huh?

174
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,261
- Piranha!

175
00:18:07,427 --> 00:18:12,474
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Tantor, where are...

176
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,813
- Aah! Aah!

177
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:24,570
- He's dead!

178
00:18:24,695 --> 00:18:26,572
We're dead!

179
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:30,409
Whoa! Oof!

180
00:18:32,453 --> 00:18:35,415
We didn't do it!
They're the ones!

181
00:18:53,308 --> 00:18:55,643
Oh, thank you, Kerchak.

182
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,941
Tarzan, buddy! Buddy, come on.
Tarzan, don't die on me.

183
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:04,819
Don't die on me.
You weren't supposed to do it!

184
00:19:04,985 --> 00:19:08,740
Get away from there!
Don't you know a piranha
can strip your flesh in seconds?

185
00:19:08,906 --> 00:19:11,867
What? He's not a piranha!
He's...

186
00:19:12,034 --> 00:19:14,119
- He's alive!

187
00:19:14,244 --> 00:19:17,331
- He's alive! He's alive!
- He's alive!

188
00:19:17,498 --> 00:19:20,167
He's alive...
You idiot!

189
00:19:20,335 --> 00:19:24,004
- You nearly gave me a heart attack.
Ya happy?
- Uh-huh.

190
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:27,800
You... I don't believe it.
You got the hair?

191
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:32,555
Is that what this is all about?
I got a whole tail of them.

192
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,557
- Tarzan!
- Terkina!

193
00:19:34,723 --> 00:19:36,142
Oh, no!

194
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:39,020
- Who's that?
- My mom.

195
00:19:39,186 --> 00:19:42,147
- Tarzan!
- Hi, Aunt Kala. - Hi.

196
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:45,108
- Oh, you scared me! What happened?
- Well, I...

197
00:19:45,234 --> 00:19:48,154
It's sort of a long...
It's involved because what happened...

198
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,573
- It was a weird...
- What happened?

199
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:57,163
- It was my fault, Kerchak.
- Tarzan!

200
00:19:57,288 --> 00:20:02,001
We were playing and well...
I'm... I'm sorry, Kerchak.

201
00:20:02,126 --> 00:20:04,169
You almost killed someone!

202
00:20:04,294 --> 00:20:06,380
- But it was an accident.
- He's only a child.

203
00:20:06,548 --> 00:20:08,550
That's no excuse, Kala!
You can't keep defending him!

204
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:10,551
- But he'll learn!
- He will never learn!

205
00:20:10,717 --> 00:20:13,221
- You can't learn to be one of us.
- Because you never give him a chance!

206
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:19,184
Give him a chance? Kala, look at him.
He will never be one of us.

207
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,436
Kerchak!

208
00:20:21,604 --> 00:20:23,857
Tarzan!

209
00:21:13,114 --> 00:21:16,408
Tarzan,
what are you doing?

210
00:21:16,533 --> 00:21:19,078
Why am I so different?

211
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:21,289
Because you're covered
with mud. That's why.

212
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:24,834
- No! Kerchak said
I didn't belong in the...
- Close your mouth.

213
00:21:25,001 --> 00:21:26,836
Kerchak said I don't belong
in the family.

214
00:21:26,961 --> 00:21:30,339
Never mind what Kerchak said.
Now, hold still!

215
00:21:30,505 --> 00:21:32,341
But, look at me!

216
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:38,848
I am, Tarzan.
And do you know what I see?

217
00:21:39,014 --> 00:21:42,018
I see two eyes,
like mine.

218
00:21:42,184 --> 00:21:45,521
And a nose...
somewhere.

219
00:21:45,646 --> 00:21:48,316
Ahh... here!

220
00:21:48,482 --> 00:21:50,984
- Two ears!

221
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:54,364
- And, let's see. What else?
- Two hands?

222
00:21:54,489 --> 00:21:56,366
That's right.

223
00:22:12,674 --> 00:22:14,967
Close your eyes.

224
00:22:15,092 --> 00:22:19,388
Now forget what you see.
What do you feel?

225
00:22:19,513 --> 00:22:22,183
My heart.

226
00:22:22,349 --> 00:22:24,394
Come here.

227
00:22:25,854 --> 00:22:27,938
- Your heart.
- See?

228
00:22:28,106 --> 00:22:31,984
We're exactly the same.

229
00:22:32,109 --> 00:22:35,821
Oh!
Kerchak just can't see that.

230
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:39,826
I'll make him see it!

231
00:22:40,117 --> 00:22:42,287
I'll be the best ape ever!

232
00:22:42,453 --> 00:22:45,915
Oh, I bet you will.

233
00:22:58,552 --> 00:23:02,182
Oh, the power to be strong

234
00:23:02,307 --> 00:23:06,059
And the wisdom
to be wise

235
00:23:06,185 --> 00:23:10,815
All these things
will come to you in time

236
00:23:12,107 --> 00:23:15,360
On this journey
that you're making

237
00:23:15,528 --> 00:23:19,781
There'll be answers
that you'll seek

238
00:23:19,948 --> 00:23:22,534
And it's you who'll climb
the mountain

239
00:23:22,659 --> 00:23:26,539
It's you who'll reach
the peak

240
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:29,751
Son of man
look to the sky

241
00:23:29,917 --> 00:23:33,003
Lift your spirit
Set it free

242
00:23:33,128 --> 00:23:36,465
Some day you'll walk tall
with pride

243
00:23:36,633 --> 00:23:41,803
Son of man
A man in time you'll be

244
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:55,944
Though there's no one there
to guide you

245
00:23:56,069 --> 00:24:00,240
No one to take your hand

246
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:02,992
But with faith
and understanding

247
00:24:03,158 --> 00:24:07,163
You will journey
from boy to man

248
00:24:07,329 --> 00:24:09,749
Son of man
look to the sky

249
00:24:09,874 --> 00:24:13,711
Lift your spirit
Set it free

250
00:24:13,877 --> 00:24:16,880
Some day you'll walk tall
with pride

251
00:24:17,048 --> 00:24:22,761
Son of man
A man in time you'll be

252
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:29,769
In learning
you will teach

253
00:24:29,894 --> 00:24:33,815
And in teaching
you will learn

254
00:24:33,982 --> 00:24:38,528
You'll find your place
beside the ones you love

255
00:24:39,988 --> 00:24:44,200
All and all
the things you've dreamed of

256
00:24:44,367 --> 00:24:47,287
The visions that you saw

257
00:24:47,412 --> 00:24:50,706
Well, the time
is drawing near now

258
00:24:50,874 --> 00:24:54,335
It's yours to claim it all

259
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:58,005
Son of man
look to the sky

260
00:24:58,172 --> 00:25:01,384
Lift your spirit
Set it free

261
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:04,636
Some day you'll walk tall
with pride

262
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:09,975
Son of man
A man in time you'll be

263
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:23,280
Son of man
Son of man's a man for all to see

264
00:25:40,714 --> 00:25:42,925
Don't even think
about it.

265
00:25:44,969 --> 00:25:47,763
- How'd you know it was me?
- I'm your mother. I know everything.

266
00:25:47,888 --> 00:25:52,184
- Where have you been?
- I thought you knew everything.

267
00:25:52,309 --> 00:25:55,855
Hey, Auntie "K."
You're looking remarkably groomed today.

268
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,690
Hello, Terk.

269
00:25:57,857 --> 00:26:01,569
Not the neck. Not the neck there, "T."

270
00:26:06,198 --> 00:26:10,161
Whoa! Okay. It's all fun and games
till someone loses an eye.

271
00:26:10,286 --> 00:26:12,829
Please stop.
Somebody's gonna get hurt.

272
00:26:12,996 --> 00:26:16,376
- And it's always me. Please.
- Cramp in the calf!

273
00:26:16,501 --> 00:26:20,754
Okay, you win! Ow, ow!
Okay! You win. Hello?

274
00:26:21,004 --> 00:26:22,882
Yo, yo, let go!

275
00:26:23,007 --> 00:26:25,926
- Oh, sorry, Terk.
- What kind of animal are you?

276
00:26:26,094 --> 00:26:29,888
I've been thinking lately
that maybe Tarzan could be
some subspecies of elephant.

277
00:26:30,013 --> 00:26:32,809
What, are you crazy? An elephant?

278
00:26:32,934 --> 00:26:35,520
Listen to me.
Think about it. He enjoys a peanut.

279
00:26:35,686 --> 00:26:38,356
- I enjoy a peanut.
- He looks nothing like you!

280
00:29:25,898 --> 00:29:28,902
Okay, everybody, move aside.
Outta my way!

281
00:29:29,068 --> 00:29:31,905
Best friend comin' through.
That would be me.

282
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:34,406
And you, don't make
a habit of that, okay?

283
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:36,826
There are other ways
of gettin' attention. You know?

284
00:29:36,951 --> 00:29:39,369
- I'll try to remember that.
- All right.

285
00:29:39,537 --> 00:29:41,873
I was right behind ya if you needed me.

286
00:30:18,117 --> 00:30:21,037
What was that?

287
00:30:21,203 --> 00:30:23,873
Ayah, it wasn't me.
I swear!

288
00:30:23,956 --> 00:30:26,667
- Okay, maybe it was.
- Everyone!

289
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:28,711
Let's move.

290
00:31:06,624 --> 00:31:09,586
Hmph.

291
00:31:16,216 --> 00:31:20,096
This reminds me
of the safari I led up the Zambezi.

292
00:31:22,223 --> 00:31:24,267
Back, back,
back, back, back.

293
00:31:24,392 --> 00:31:26,769
Ooh, was it scary there.

294
00:31:26,935 --> 00:31:32,024
Two men with only three rifles.
We blasted away.

295
00:31:32,149 --> 00:31:35,235
That's when I knew
I was born for Africa!

296
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,240
And Africa
was created for...

297
00:31:45,454 --> 00:31:48,040
Clayton!

298
00:31:48,207 --> 00:31:50,376
Clayton!
Oh, there you are.

299
00:31:50,501 --> 00:31:53,503
What is it? What is it, Clayton?
Are we in danger?

300
00:31:53,629 --> 00:31:55,714
I thought I saw something.

301
00:31:55,882 --> 00:31:59,176
Is it a Hippopotamus Amphibious,
or a Rhinoceros Bihornus?

302
00:31:59,301 --> 00:32:01,596
- Professor, don't move!
- Ah, right.

303
00:32:01,762 --> 00:32:05,058
Daddy?

304
00:32:05,224 --> 00:32:08,353
Daddy, what's all
the hullabaloo about? Aah!

305
00:32:10,896 --> 00:32:12,732
What is it, Daddy?

306
00:32:12,857 --> 00:32:16,027
Mr Clayton asked me not to move.
He saw something.

307
00:32:18,195 --> 00:32:20,615
Oh, I moved.

308
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,826
Ah, Mr Clayton, sorry.
Excuse me, uh...

309
00:32:23,992 --> 00:32:27,163
But my father and I came on
this expedition to study gorillas.

310
00:32:27,329 --> 00:32:30,582
I believe your shooting
might be scaring them off.

311
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:34,837
You hired me to protect you,
Miss Porter, and protect you I shall.

312
00:32:34,963 --> 00:32:37,298
And you're doing
a marvellous job of it.

313
00:32:37,423 --> 00:32:40,885
- We only have a short time
before the ship returns...

314
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:44,973
Jane! Jane, do you realize
what you're standing in?

315
00:32:45,138 --> 00:32:47,015
- A gorilla's nest!
- Oh, Daddy!

316
00:32:47,183 --> 00:32:50,895
At last,
our first sign in days!

317
00:32:51,061 --> 00:32:53,897
- Do you think the beasts
could be nearby?
- Could be.

318
00:32:54,022 --> 00:32:57,902
There's the evidence.
Not very far, anyway.

319
00:32:58,069 --> 00:32:59,736
Daddy, look!
Over there and there!

320
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:02,197
Where? Oh, yes,
more nests! I see them!

321
00:33:02,365 --> 00:33:06,994
- Just as you predicted.
- Whole family groups!
Jane, I love you!

322
00:33:09,204 --> 00:33:13,667
Family groups? Excuse me,
but these are wild beasts...

323
00:33:13,835 --> 00:33:15,878
that would sooner tear your head off
than look at you.

324
00:33:16,003 --> 00:33:19,382
On the contrary. Daddy's theory
is that these are social creatures...

325
00:33:25,888 --> 00:33:29,099
Mr Clayton, please!
What if it's a gorilla?

326
00:33:29,224 --> 00:33:31,226
It's no gorilla.

327
00:33:33,812 --> 00:33:35,857
Hmm.

328
00:33:35,982 --> 00:33:38,151
- But perhaps we should press on.
- Yes, indeed.

329
00:33:38,318 --> 00:33:41,905
We should keep heading west
following the Ganoderma Ablonatum.

330
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:45,908
Excellent, Professor! I could've used
your expertise on my last safari.

331
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:51,998
Oh!

332
00:33:52,123 --> 00:33:54,375
Oh!

333
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,793
Are you what all the fuss
was about?

334
00:33:56,919 --> 00:33:59,923
Daddy!
Daddy, quick!

335
00:34:00,048 --> 00:34:02,090
No, wait, wait.
Hold still.

336
00:34:02,258 --> 00:34:04,176
Oh, my.
Oh, my good...

337
00:34:04,344 --> 00:34:06,471
You may not be a gorilla,

338
00:34:06,637 --> 00:34:08,722
but you are one sweet little...

339
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:14,771
Huh. There you go.
What do you think?

340
00:34:18,482 --> 00:34:20,901
What? Oh!

341
00:34:21,068 --> 00:34:22,736
Why, you little...

342
00:34:22,903 --> 00:34:25,865
Well, this is
absolutely peachy!

343
00:34:26,031 --> 00:34:30,327
Come to study gorillas, and get
my sketchbook pinched by a baboon!

344
00:34:35,457 --> 00:34:37,834
Ohh. Ah-ha-ha.

345
00:34:38,002 --> 00:34:39,294
Give me that!

346
00:34:41,296 --> 00:34:45,051
Come on now, enough of this.
I want this paper on the count of three.

347
00:34:45,218 --> 00:34:48,345
One, two...

348
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:50,597
Oh, look, bananas!

349
00:34:50,848 --> 00:34:54,935
I can't believe you fell for that one!

350
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:59,524
- No, no, don't give me
those crocodile tears.

351
00:34:59,649 --> 00:35:02,193
- What would your parents have to say?

352
00:35:04,444 --> 00:35:07,781
Oh! See, I told you
they'd be cross.

353
00:35:07,948 --> 00:35:11,077
Go easy on him.
Children will be children.

354
00:35:29,636 --> 00:35:33,725
Oh! I'm flying!
What on earth am I...

355
00:35:36,352 --> 00:35:40,106
Get off! Get off!

356
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,738
Oh! Put me down!
Put me down!

357
00:35:46,905 --> 00:35:50,700
No!Pick me up, pick me up!

358
00:35:54,287 --> 00:35:57,874
Aah! Oh, no!

359
00:36:15,892 --> 00:36:18,560
Unhand me!

360
00:36:32,867 --> 00:36:34,910
Uh-oh.

361
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:40,207
- Ah, over there!

362
00:37:30,341 --> 00:37:33,928
I'm in a tree with a man
who talks to monkeys.

363
00:37:34,053 --> 00:37:36,638
Ooh, I can't do this!
I can't... Oh!

364
00:37:36,763 --> 00:37:39,475
This is good.
This is... very good.

365
00:37:39,642 --> 00:37:43,812
Wait. One, two...

366
00:37:43,937 --> 00:37:46,356
Ohh!

367
00:37:46,481 --> 00:37:50,319
- It can't get any worse, can it?

368
00:37:52,321 --> 00:37:54,740
Obviously, it can.

369
00:37:57,368 --> 00:38:02,999
Ah... no! Oh!

370
00:38:03,165 --> 00:38:07,127
Stay back. No, don't.
Don't come any closer. Please, don't.

371
00:38:07,294 --> 00:38:09,796
What are... What are you doing?

372
00:38:09,964 --> 00:38:13,218
Please don't.
That tickles.

373
00:38:13,383 --> 00:38:14,968
No, get off, get off...
Get off!

374
00:38:15,135 --> 00:38:17,555
It serves you right.

375
00:38:17,722 --> 00:38:21,935
Stay away from me like
a very good wild man. You, stay.

376
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:24,604
I'm warning you.
My father won't take kindly to you...

377
00:38:24,729 --> 00:38:27,941
No. That's...
Now, that's close enough.

378
00:38:28,106 --> 00:38:32,403
How dare you?
Wha...

379
00:39:06,646 --> 00:39:10,066
Ohh!
Um...

380
00:39:10,232 --> 00:39:14,236
- Oh, oh.

381
00:39:17,156 --> 00:39:21,410
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear, oh, dear. Oh, dear!

382
00:39:21,535 --> 00:39:26,415
Yes, thank you. It's a lovely heartbeat.
It's very nice.

383
00:39:28,167 --> 00:39:30,044
It's very nice.

384
00:39:30,211 --> 00:39:33,506
Oh, thank you. I can't do a thing
with it in this humidity though. It's...

385
00:39:33,673 --> 00:39:35,883
You...
You do speak.

386
00:39:36,008 --> 00:39:39,595
And all this time I thought
you were just a big, wild,
quiet, silent person-thing.

387
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:43,807
Why didn't you tell me?
I must say I'm rather curious
as to who you are. I'd love...

388
00:39:45,142 --> 00:39:47,812
Tarzan.

389
00:39:52,149 --> 00:39:53,943
Tarzan.

390
00:39:54,109 --> 00:39:56,696
Tarzan.

391
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,783
Oh, I see!

392
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:03,912
Oh, I see!

393
00:40:04,077 --> 00:40:05,830
Tarzan.

394
00:40:05,997 --> 00:40:07,957
Oh, I see.

395
00:40:08,124 --> 00:40:10,459
No, no, no.
No.

396
00:40:10,584 --> 00:40:13,713
I'm Jane.

397
00:40:13,879 --> 00:40:17,591
No, no, no. No.
I'm Jane.

398
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:23,222
No, no.
Jane. Tarzan.

399
00:40:23,388 --> 00:40:25,725
Jane.

400
00:40:25,892 --> 00:40:29,062
- Jane.
- Exactly.

401
00:40:29,187 --> 00:40:31,481
- Clayton!

402
00:40:33,816 --> 00:40:36,568
- Clayton!

403
00:40:36,736 --> 00:40:38,571
Extraordinary!

404
00:40:38,696 --> 00:40:42,533
Um, please,
can you take me to my camp?

405
00:40:44,743 --> 00:40:47,120
Yes! Clayton!
Wonderful!

406
00:40:47,287 --> 00:40:52,252
Um, could we...
Um, can't we walk?

407
00:40:52,417 --> 00:40:55,213
Can't we walk?

408
00:40:56,381 --> 00:40:59,175
- Tarzan!
- Tarzan, where are ya?

409
00:40:59,341 --> 00:41:02,220
Let's hope
we find him before Kerchak does.

410
00:41:02,386 --> 00:41:04,472
- Maybe he's lost.
Or found something more interesting.

411
00:41:04,597 --> 00:41:07,140
What, are you nuts? What could be
more interesting than us?

412
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:11,354
What's everybody lookin' at?

413
00:41:11,479 --> 00:41:14,314
Ohh!

414
00:41:17,776 --> 00:41:21,281
The horror!
It's gruesome! Hide me!

415
00:41:21,406 --> 00:41:24,158
- Pull yourself together.
You're embarrassing me.
- Huh?

416
00:41:24,325 --> 00:41:28,745
- These things aren't alive.
- I knew that.

417
00:41:28,912 --> 00:41:32,249
- Tarzan! - Tarzan?
- Tarzan?

418
00:41:32,374 --> 00:41:34,209
Hello?

419
00:41:34,459 --> 00:41:40,008
What kind of primitive beasts
are responsible for this mess?

420
00:41:41,301 --> 00:41:43,428
Whoa!

421
00:41:47,515 --> 00:41:50,852
Wow! Come here, you guys! Come here,
come here, come here. Look at this!

422
00:41:51,019 --> 00:41:53,271
- What is that? Funny. Wow, it's...
- What is that thing?

423
00:41:53,437 --> 00:41:57,482
- Oooh!

424
00:41:59,776 --> 00:42:02,988
Hey, do it again.
Do it again.

425
00:42:03,113 --> 00:42:05,825
- Like this?

426
00:42:05,992 --> 00:42:07,952
- Yeah!

427
00:42:09,662 --> 00:42:11,747
Yeah, rip it!

428
00:42:11,872 --> 00:42:14,209
- I love that part!

429
00:42:16,669 --> 00:42:18,796
- Let me hear it, big fella.

430
00:42:18,963 --> 00:42:21,925
- Now, hit it!

431
00:42:22,841 --> 00:42:25,970
- Yeah!

432
00:42:26,095 --> 00:42:28,347
- Nice!

433
00:42:30,098 --> 00:42:32,142
What the heck?
Bye-bye.

434
00:42:32,267 --> 00:42:34,646
- Terk!

435
00:42:34,812 --> 00:42:36,439
- Yeah, Tant?
- Hmm?

436
00:42:36,564 --> 00:42:40,026
Now! Hit it!
Come on, Tantor!

437
00:42:40,151 --> 00:42:43,863
- Oh, I love it!

438
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:47,783
Stay with me, fellas.
I feel somethin' happenin' here.

439
00:43:21,191 --> 00:43:22,609
Yeah!

440
00:43:32,745 --> 00:43:34,872
Ahh! Yeah!

441
00:44:09,823 --> 00:44:11,075
Whoa

442
00:44:14,453 --> 00:44:17,164
Ahh, gorillas!

443
00:44:23,963 --> 00:44:26,798
He's one of them!

444
00:44:36,642 --> 00:44:38,560
Ooo.

445
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,865
Oh, my...

446
00:44:52,992 --> 00:44:54,868
Ohh!

447
00:45:25,816 --> 00:45:28,944
- Jane! Jane!
- Jane!

448
00:45:30,863 --> 00:45:33,783
Jane, where are you?

449
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:36,618
Jane! Oh, Jane!
Oh, thank goodness.

450
00:45:36,743 --> 00:45:38,620
Good heavens,
what happened?

451
00:45:38,872 --> 00:45:41,290
Are you all right? We've been
everywhere looking for you. I...

452
00:45:41,457 --> 00:45:46,546
- Oh, my goodness! Daddy!
I was out walking. I was...
- Yes, yes.

453
00:45:46,671 --> 00:45:49,673
- Little baby monkey. I drew a picture.
- Yes, go on.

454
00:45:49,798 --> 00:45:51,885
- Suddenly the monkey starts crying.
- Oh, poor thing.

455
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:54,803
- I turned 'round and there's
a whole fleet of them!
- Of what?

456
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:58,390
- There's an army of monkeys.
A huge tree full of them.
- Monkeys? Monkeys!

457
00:45:58,557 --> 00:46:00,852
Screaming at me!
Ooo-ooo-ooo!

458
00:46:01,019 --> 00:46:03,104
- That's Theripithicus baboonus.
She's very good at this.
- Oh, really?

459
00:46:03,271 --> 00:46:08,651
- Terrified I was. And suddenly,
I was swinging in the vines.
- With the monkeys, yes?

460
00:46:08,776 --> 00:46:10,819
- Swinging, flying. I was in the air.
- In the air, yes, I know.

461
00:46:10,986 --> 00:46:12,906
- And I'm all surrounded.
- What did you do?

462
00:46:13,071 --> 00:46:16,408
- Daddy, they took my boot.
- They took...
Those are the ones I bought you.

463
00:46:16,533 --> 00:46:21,914
And I was saved! I was saved
by a flying wild man in a loincloth.

464
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,459
- Loincloth? Good Lord.
- What is she talking about?

465
00:46:24,626 --> 00:46:27,921
I haven't the foggiest idea.
Takes after her mother, you know.

466
00:46:28,046 --> 00:46:31,089
She'd come up with stories like that.
Not about men in loincloths, of course.

467
00:46:31,256 --> 00:46:33,343
- And there were gorillas.
- Gorillas?

468
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:36,763
- They were doing...
- You saw the gorillas?
Where, Jane, where?

469
00:46:36,888 --> 00:46:38,890
He left with them.

470
00:46:39,015 --> 00:46:40,475
Who, dear, who?

471
00:46:40,642 --> 00:46:42,935
Tarzan.

472
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:47,064
- Tarzan?
- The ape man.

473
00:46:47,189 --> 00:46:48,191
Hmm.

474
00:46:50,276 --> 00:46:53,028
Everyone, we will avoid
the strangers.

475
00:46:53,196 --> 00:46:56,950
- Do not let them see you,
and do not seek them out.
- They mean us no harm, Kerchak.

476
00:46:57,075 --> 00:47:00,077
- Tarzan, I don't know that.
- But I do. I've spent time with them.

477
00:47:00,202 --> 00:47:02,747
You may be willing to risk
our safety, but I'm not.

478
00:47:02,872 --> 00:47:05,542
Why are you threatened
by anyone different from you?

479
00:47:08,211 --> 00:47:12,881
Protect this family,
and stay away from them.

480
00:47:16,426 --> 00:47:18,680
Tarzan, for once
listen to Kerchak.

481
00:47:18,847 --> 00:47:22,559
Why didn't you tell me there were
creatures that looked like me?

482
00:47:30,399 --> 00:47:33,193
Well, he didn't stand upright,
he sort of crouched, like that.

483
00:47:34,903 --> 00:47:37,073
- Really?
- Supported his weight on his knuckles.

484
00:47:37,198 --> 00:47:38,867
- On the knuckles!
- See?

485
00:47:39,033 --> 00:47:41,035
- Exactly like a gorilla!
- Extraordinary!

486
00:47:41,202 --> 00:47:43,037
Ah, it was amazing!

487
00:47:43,203 --> 00:47:46,540
And he bends his elbows out like this,
and then he walks like this.

488
00:47:46,665 --> 00:47:49,711
Oh, I see!
Like Aunt Isabel!

489
00:47:49,836 --> 00:47:53,214
- Bup-bup-bup, oh-oh
This is capital!
- Mmm.

490
00:47:53,339 --> 00:47:55,883
Oh, Janey, Jane!
What a discovery!

491
00:47:56,008 --> 00:47:58,051
A man with no language,
no human behaviour.

492
00:47:58,178 --> 00:48:00,555
And no respect
for personal boundaries.

493
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:04,309
- How do you mean?
- He was this close, Daddy!
Staring at me.

494
00:48:04,434 --> 00:48:07,644
He seemed confused
at first,

495
00:48:07,812 --> 00:48:10,939
as if he's never seen
another human before.

496
00:48:11,064 --> 00:48:13,401
His eyes were intense,

497
00:48:13,568 --> 00:48:16,278
and focused and...

498
00:48:16,403 --> 00:48:20,575
I've never seen such eyes.

499
00:48:20,742 --> 00:48:23,327
Oh, shall I,
ahem,

500
00:48:23,493 --> 00:48:27,247
Leave you and the blackboard
alone for a moment?

501
00:48:27,372 --> 00:48:31,252
Daddy, stop it. The point is,
think of what we could learn from him.

502
00:48:31,419 --> 00:48:33,838
- We must find him.
- Ooh!

503
00:48:34,046 --> 00:48:37,841
Professor, you are here
to find gorillas,

504
00:48:38,008 --> 00:48:40,303
not indulge
some girlish fantasy.

505
00:48:40,428 --> 00:48:44,432
Fantasy? I didn't imagine him!
Tarzan is...

506
00:48:44,557 --> 00:48:47,142
- real.

507
00:48:47,267 --> 00:48:51,522
Ah! It's him!
It's, it's, it's him. Tarzan!

508
00:48:51,689 --> 00:48:53,524
- Professor! Jane! Stand back!
- Wait!

509
00:48:53,691 --> 00:48:55,609
- No!

510
00:48:55,776 --> 00:48:57,611
Clayton.

511
00:48:57,778 --> 00:48:59,613
Huh?

512
00:48:59,738 --> 00:49:01,615
- Clayton.
- Ahh!

513
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:03,993
Have we... met?

514
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,120
How does he
know my name?

515
00:49:07,287 --> 00:49:09,707
He thinks it means
the sound of a gunshot.

516
00:49:09,874 --> 00:49:13,627
- Jane.
- Yes, hello, mmm, Tarzan.

517
00:49:13,752 --> 00:49:15,964
I see what you mean
about those personal boundaries.

518
00:49:16,129 --> 00:49:19,466
- What's he doing?

519
00:49:19,591 --> 00:49:21,510
- Look at him, Jane.

520
00:49:21,635 --> 00:49:23,805
Moves like an ape
but looks like a man.

521
00:49:23,972 --> 00:49:26,682
He could be
the missing link!

522
00:49:26,807 --> 00:49:29,769
Or our link
to the gorillas.

523
00:49:29,894 --> 00:49:31,812
Ahh, yes, yes.

524
00:49:31,937 --> 00:49:35,899
Where are the gorillas?

525
00:49:37,276 --> 00:49:39,611
Go-ril-las!

526
00:49:39,736 --> 00:49:41,823
Go-ril-las!

527
00:49:41,948 --> 00:49:44,742
Shouting won't help, Mr Clayton.
He doesn't understand English.

528
00:49:44,908 --> 00:49:46,910
Then I'll make him
understand.

529
00:49:47,035 --> 00:49:49,914
If I can teach a parrot
to sing "God Save the Queen,"

530
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:53,626
I can certainly teach this savage
a thing or two.

531
00:49:55,044 --> 00:49:56,921
Go-rilla.

532
00:49:58,131 --> 00:50:01,176
- Go-rilla.
- Oh-ho! He's got it!

533
00:50:01,301 --> 00:50:04,428
Gorilla.
Gorilla!

534
00:50:04,595 --> 00:50:06,680
- Perhaps not.
- No, no, no, no!

535
00:50:06,805 --> 00:50:09,684
- No, no, no, no, no!
- No, no, no. Gimme that.

536
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:11,269
No, no.
Leave that. No.

537
00:50:11,435 --> 00:50:14,689
Mr Clayton,
I think I'll take it from here.

538
00:50:24,365 --> 00:50:26,450
What ever you do

539
00:50:26,618 --> 00:50:28,952
I'll do it too

540
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:32,247
Show me everything
Tell me how

541
00:50:32,372 --> 00:50:34,792
It all means something

542
00:50:34,959 --> 00:50:37,419
And yet nothing to me

543
00:50:40,381 --> 00:50:43,968
I can see
there's so much to learn

544
00:50:44,135 --> 00:50:48,263
It's all so close
and yet so far

545
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:52,227
I see my self
as people see me

546
00:50:52,352 --> 00:50:56,272
Oh, I just know there's
something bigger out there

547
00:50:56,397 --> 00:51:00,276
I wanna know
Can you show me

548
00:51:00,443 --> 00:51:04,280
I wanna know about
these strangers like me

549
00:51:04,446 --> 00:51:08,243
Tell me more
Please show me

550
00:51:08,368 --> 00:51:12,330
Something's familiar about
these strangers like me

551
00:51:20,629 --> 00:51:23,006
Every gesture

552
00:51:23,131 --> 00:51:28,345
Every move that she makes
makes me feel like never before

553
00:51:28,513 --> 00:51:30,682
Why do I have

554
00:51:30,807 --> 00:51:34,810
This growing need
to be beside her

555
00:51:36,479 --> 00:51:40,066
Ooo, these emotions
I never knew

556
00:51:40,191 --> 00:51:44,319
Of some other world
far beyond this place

557
00:51:44,444 --> 00:51:48,115
Beyond the trees
above the clouds

558
00:51:48,283 --> 00:51:52,370
I see before me
a new horizon

559
00:51:52,537 --> 00:51:56,499
I wanna know
Can you show me

560
00:51:56,665 --> 00:52:00,461
I wanna know about
these strangers like me

561
00:52:00,586 --> 00:52:04,464
Tell me more
Please show me

562
00:52:04,631 --> 00:52:08,385
Something's familiar about
these strangers like me

563
00:52:09,803 --> 00:52:13,640
Come with me now
to see my world

564
00:52:13,807 --> 00:52:17,812
Where there's beauty
beyond your dreams

565
00:52:17,979 --> 00:52:21,899
Can you feel the things
I feel

566
00:52:22,024 --> 00:52:25,736
Right now with you

567
00:52:27,613 --> 00:52:30,158
Take my hand

568
00:52:30,283 --> 00:52:33,912
There's a world
I need to know

569
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:54,265
We've wasted
all this time on what he wants.

570
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:58,435
The boat could arrive any day.
Now ask him straight out.

571
00:53:00,479 --> 00:53:02,856
Tarzan?

572
00:53:03,024 --> 00:53:05,359
Will you take us
to the gorillas?

573
00:53:05,526 --> 00:53:07,694
Do you understand?

574
00:53:07,819 --> 00:53:09,696
I understand.

575
00:53:09,821 --> 00:53:11,740
- Ooh! Good work, Jane.
- Well?

576
00:53:11,908 --> 00:53:13,618
I can't.

577
00:53:13,785 --> 00:53:15,537
- What? - What?
- Why not, Tarzan?

578
00:53:15,662 --> 00:53:18,289
Kerchak.

579
00:53:18,455 --> 00:53:20,582
Wh-wh...

580
00:53:20,749 --> 00:53:24,711
I wanna know
Can you show me

581
00:53:24,879 --> 00:53:28,591
I wanna know about
these strangers like me

582
00:53:28,716 --> 00:53:33,095
Tell me more
Please show me

583
00:53:33,263 --> 00:53:37,600
Something's familiar about
these strangers like me

584
00:53:37,767 --> 00:53:39,769
I wanna know

585
00:53:57,077 --> 00:54:01,499
Oh, Terk, I've never
seen him so happy.

586
00:54:01,624 --> 00:54:03,417
Eh, I give it a week.

587
00:54:06,588 --> 00:54:08,839
Aye, cut her loose!

588
00:54:09,131 --> 00:54:12,676
- Arg, c'mon.
- All right, move it, you field rats.

589
00:54:14,845 --> 00:54:16,138
Put your back into it.

590
00:54:16,305 --> 00:54:18,975
Wait, please. Don't...
I've waited 30 years for this,

591
00:54:19,142 --> 00:54:21,310
and I won't leave
until I see a gorilla.

592
00:54:21,435 --> 00:54:23,437
Oh, isn't this dreadful,
Tarzan?

593
00:54:23,604 --> 00:54:25,814
Whoa!
No, no. Wait.

594
00:54:30,444 --> 00:54:32,613
You're the captain.

595
00:54:32,738 --> 00:54:35,283
Just tell them you've had engine
trouble, and give us two more days.

596
00:54:35,408 --> 00:54:37,827
And be late at every port
from here to London?

597
00:54:37,952 --> 00:54:39,828
We'll have come all this way
for nothing.

598
00:54:39,995 --> 00:54:43,917
I'm sorry, Miss Porter,
but I simply can't do it.

599
00:54:44,082 --> 00:54:46,127
Agh!
This is your fault.

600
00:54:46,252 --> 00:54:49,464
I should've followed my instincts,
and set traps for the beasts.

601
00:54:49,589 --> 00:54:52,091
Don't you think I'm disappointed
about the gorillas?

602
00:54:52,216 --> 00:54:55,135
- You are absolutely impos...
- Oh!

603
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:58,805
Tarzan! I was so afraid
you wouldn't come in time.

604
00:54:58,932 --> 00:55:01,350
The boat's arrived.
The boat that's come...

605
00:55:01,475 --> 00:55:03,727
to take us home
to England.

606
00:55:03,894 --> 00:55:07,941
And Daddy and I were wond...
Well, I was wondering...

607
00:55:08,106 --> 00:55:12,403
Well, we really hope that you'll
come with us. Won't you?

608
00:55:13,905 --> 00:55:16,698
Go see England today,
come home tomorrow.

609
00:55:16,865 --> 00:55:18,993
Oh, no.

610
00:55:19,118 --> 00:55:23,372
Well, you see, it would be
very difficult to come back... ever.

611
00:55:23,497 --> 00:55:24,999
Not come back?

612
00:55:25,165 --> 00:55:28,169
Oh, no, no. I know it sounds awful,
but you belong with us.

613
00:55:28,336 --> 00:55:31,089
- With people.
- Jane must stay with Tarzan.

614
00:55:31,214 --> 00:55:34,175
Wh... Stay here?
Oh, no, no. My laundry.

615
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:38,303
No, I can't stay.
Look, I've got...

616
00:55:38,428 --> 00:55:40,765
I've got my father
and...

617
00:55:40,932 --> 00:55:44,394
Jane, stay.

618
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:47,229
- But...
- Please.

619
00:55:49,439 --> 00:55:51,568
But... I can't.

620
00:55:54,361 --> 00:55:55,946
Women!

621
00:55:56,113 --> 00:55:58,867
How typical!
Thank you, Jones.

622
00:55:59,033 --> 00:56:03,162
Even if you hadn't grown up a savage,
you'd be lost.

623
00:56:03,328 --> 00:56:06,540
There are no trails
through a woman's heart.

624
00:56:06,665 --> 00:56:09,042
Jane is going.

625
00:56:09,167 --> 00:56:14,548
Yes. If only she could've spent
more time with the gorillas.

626
00:56:14,716 --> 00:56:16,885
She's so disappointed.

627
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:19,720
Crushed, really.

628
00:56:19,888 --> 00:56:22,723
Sorry, old boy.

629
00:56:22,848 --> 00:56:26,144
Oh, well. I'd best
get Jane's things to the ship.

630
00:56:30,397 --> 00:56:33,318
Clayton!

631
00:56:33,484 --> 00:56:35,736
If Jane sees gorillas,

632
00:56:35,861 --> 00:56:37,738
she stays?

633
00:56:37,863 --> 00:56:41,117
Say, that's why she came,
isn't it?

634
00:56:42,202 --> 00:56:44,328
I'll do it.

635
00:56:44,495 --> 00:56:47,624
- Good man! Snipes?
- Sir?

636
00:56:47,749 --> 00:56:52,211
Get the boys together.
There's gonna be a change in plans.

637
00:56:52,461 --> 00:56:54,631
Terk, all you have to do
is get Kerchak out of the way.

638
00:56:54,796 --> 00:56:56,633
- What?
- I'd be happy to get Kerchak...

639
00:56:56,758 --> 00:57:00,010
Shut your trunk
and get me outta here.

640
00:57:00,178 --> 00:57:02,597
Can you believe that guy?

641
00:57:02,763 --> 00:57:06,225
Drops us like a newborn giraffe...
kerplop!

642
00:57:06,392 --> 00:57:09,437
Now waltzes in here
and expects us to just...

643
00:57:09,604 --> 00:57:12,147
Terk, I'm asking you
as a friend.

644
00:57:12,272 --> 00:57:15,151
Aah! Aah!

645
00:57:15,318 --> 00:57:17,653
With the face
and the eyes, and the...

646
00:57:17,819 --> 00:57:19,696
Aah! All right!

647
00:57:19,863 --> 00:57:22,283
But don't make me do
anything embarrassing.

648
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:24,993
I'm gonna kill him!

649
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:28,539
A-Actually, I thought that dress
was rather slimming on you.

650
00:57:28,705 --> 00:57:31,124
Oh, really? I thought it was
a little revealing and kind of...

651
00:57:31,292 --> 00:57:34,504
- Aah!

652
00:57:34,671 --> 00:57:36,798
- How does she move in this thing?

653
00:57:39,633 --> 00:57:41,468
Look out!

654
00:58:07,452 --> 00:58:10,957
- Oh, look, Daddy.
- Where? Wh... Wh...

655
00:58:11,124 --> 00:58:13,834
Jane!

656
00:58:13,959 --> 00:58:18,089
Be careful, Professor.

657
00:58:18,256 --> 00:58:21,301
She's beautiful.

658
00:58:21,466 --> 00:58:23,845
She's my mother.

659
00:58:24,011 --> 00:58:26,263
Th...
This is your...

660
00:58:28,182 --> 00:58:30,059
mother.

661
00:58:39,693 --> 00:58:41,361
Wh-What's happening?

662
00:58:41,486 --> 00:58:43,448
I don't know,
Daddy.

663
00:58:43,573 --> 00:58:48,410
- Oh, it's getting away!
- No! You'll only frighten her more.

664
00:58:55,251 --> 00:58:58,963
Oh, yes. Absolutely, my dear.
Good idea.

665
00:58:59,129 --> 00:59:01,216
What are you doing?
Do you want to frighten them off?

666
00:59:01,341 --> 00:59:03,593
Get up!
Get...

667
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,970
Don't get up.

668
00:59:08,722 --> 00:59:10,850
Ah.

669
00:59:27,075 --> 00:59:30,662
Ohh.

670
00:59:36,251 --> 00:59:38,127
Hello.

671
00:59:40,588 --> 00:59:43,006
Ooh.

672
00:59:43,131 --> 00:59:45,676
It's very nice
to meet you too.

673
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:52,642
Oh, Your Majesty, you're such a tease.

674
00:59:54,894 --> 00:59:58,231
Hello. Hello. Uh,
Archimedes Q. Porter at your service.

675
00:59:58,397 --> 01:00:00,357
Aah!
Quite a grip you've got.

676
01:00:00,524 --> 01:00:03,111
Oh, thank you.

677
01:00:03,236 --> 01:00:05,905
- Is that one of mine?

678
01:00:06,030 --> 01:00:08,448
Oh, this is wonderful,
Mr Clayton!

679
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:10,158
Look! Look!
Social grooming.

680
01:00:10,325 --> 01:00:13,453
Congratulations,
Professor.

681
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:16,957
Our dream has come true.

682
01:00:18,917 --> 01:00:23,046
- Give me that!
Hey, what're you doing?

683
01:00:23,171 --> 01:00:26,133
Stop that! Stop!
Hold on, now! Leave that!

684
01:00:26,258 --> 01:00:28,385
That is not
to be played with!

685
01:00:43,443 --> 01:00:45,986
- Can you teach me?
- Speak gorilla?

686
01:00:46,111 --> 01:00:48,031
Mmm, yes.

687
01:00:50,158 --> 01:00:53,118
- Oo-oo-ee.
- Oo-oo-ee.

688
01:00:53,285 --> 01:00:55,495
- Eh-ooo.
- Eh-ooo.

689
01:00:56,622 --> 01:00:59,334
- Ooo. Ooo.
- Ooo. Ooo.

690
01:00:59,499 --> 01:01:01,336
Ooo.

691
01:01:01,502 --> 01:01:03,379
Ooo.

692
01:01:03,546 --> 01:01:05,839
- Ooo-ooh-ee-ah-ooo.

693
01:01:10,345 --> 01:01:12,888
Good heavens!
What did I say?

694
01:01:13,055 --> 01:01:16,267
That Jane stays
with Tarzan.

695
01:01:16,392 --> 01:01:19,437
Stay?
But I thought we'd already...

696
01:01:19,562 --> 01:01:22,356
- But, Tarzan, I, I...
- Whoa!

697
01:01:22,481 --> 01:01:25,026
Whoa! Look out!

698
01:01:25,151 --> 01:01:27,278
Whoa! Ow!

699
01:01:27,403 --> 01:01:30,448
- Is that my dress?
- Oh, no.

700
01:01:34,410 --> 01:01:37,120
- Oh, Daddy.
- Ooo-ooo.

701
01:01:37,247 --> 01:01:40,707
Give it to me!

702
01:01:40,832 --> 01:01:42,627
- Huh?

703
01:01:43,919 --> 01:01:45,879
No!

704
01:02:02,856 --> 01:02:04,481
Go!

705
01:02:06,276 --> 01:02:09,278
- Wait! Wait! Tarzan!
- Go now!

706
01:02:09,403 --> 01:02:12,490
Jane, quickly!
Hurry! Come along.

707
01:02:31,885 --> 01:02:34,345
Kerchak, I didn't...

708
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:38,765
- I'm sorry, I...
- I asked you to protect our family,

709
01:02:38,932 --> 01:02:42,519
and you betrayed us all.

710
01:03:11,131 --> 01:03:14,010
I'm so confused.

711
01:03:14,135 --> 01:03:17,388
Come with me.

712
01:03:17,555 --> 01:03:21,392
There's something I should've
shown you long ago.

713
01:04:40,388 --> 01:04:42,265
Is this me?

714
01:04:46,519 --> 01:04:50,397
And this is my father,
and,

715
01:04:50,522 --> 01:04:52,774
and my...

716
01:04:52,941 --> 01:04:55,903
Now you know.

717
01:04:56,069 --> 01:05:00,240
Tarzan, I just want you
to be happy,

718
01:05:00,408 --> 01:05:02,535
whatever you decide.

719
01:05:50,582 --> 01:05:54,963
No matter where I go,
you will always be my mother.

720
01:05:59,175 --> 01:06:03,136
And you will always
be in my heart.

721
01:06:20,821 --> 01:06:24,533
Oh, goodbye, Tarzan.

722
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:28,037
Tarzan!
I'm so glad you found us in time.

723
01:06:31,457 --> 01:06:35,002
Let's get in the boat, shall we?
Mustn't keep the captain waiting.

724
01:06:37,171 --> 01:06:40,048
Tarzan!

725
01:06:40,175 --> 01:06:43,720
We're too late!
I can't believe it!

726
01:06:43,845 --> 01:06:45,722
If you'd have pulled over
and asked for directions...

727
01:06:45,847 --> 01:06:48,098
We didn't get
to say goodbye.

728
01:06:48,265 --> 01:06:51,519
Yeah, well, good riddance!
All right? Who needs ya? Huh?

729
01:06:51,644 --> 01:06:56,274
Go on, get out of here, bald boy!
You ingrate! You bald ingrate!

730
01:06:56,441 --> 01:06:58,359
Go on and rot,
for all I care!

731
01:06:58,526 --> 01:07:00,403
Go!

732
01:07:02,571 --> 01:07:06,117
- What are you lookin' at?
- I'm gonna miss him too.

733
01:07:14,542 --> 01:07:17,544
Tarzan, you can't imagine
what's in store for you.

734
01:07:17,669 --> 01:07:20,798
You're going to see the world.
Everyone's going to want to meet you.

735
01:07:20,964 --> 01:07:22,841
Kings, scientists
and famous writers.

736
01:07:22,966 --> 01:07:26,428
Yes, Darwin and Kipling.
Queen Victoria.

737
01:07:26,553 --> 01:07:28,722
I haven't met her,
but I heard she's awfully nice.

738
01:07:28,890 --> 01:07:32,769
- And I'll be with Jane?
- Mmm. Mmm.

739
01:07:32,935 --> 01:07:36,522
Yes, with Jane.

740
01:07:36,689 --> 01:07:39,066
Ooh! Slippery.

741
01:07:58,127 --> 01:08:00,796
- Tarzan!

742
01:08:00,879 --> 01:08:03,091
- Ow!
- Tarzan!

743
01:08:03,258 --> 01:08:05,760
Get him!

744
01:08:05,926 --> 01:08:09,097
Get him!

745
01:08:09,222 --> 01:08:11,765
- Tarzan!
- Jane!

746
01:08:33,288 --> 01:08:37,292
- What's going on here?
- Clayton. Clayton, help.

747
01:08:37,417 --> 01:08:41,003
- Have we met?

748
01:08:44,257 --> 01:08:46,133
Ah, yes.

749
01:08:46,258 --> 01:08:48,136
The ape man.

750
01:08:48,261 --> 01:08:52,472
Clayton, you...
You...

751
01:08:54,184 --> 01:08:56,895
So sorry about
the rude welcome, old boy.

752
01:08:57,061 --> 01:08:59,480
But I couldn't have you
making a scene...

753
01:08:59,646 --> 01:09:02,984
when we put your furry friends
in their cages.

754
01:09:03,150 --> 01:09:06,320
- Why?
- Why?

755
01:09:06,486 --> 01:09:09,281
For three hundred pounds sterling
a head.

756
01:09:09,449 --> 01:09:12,659
Actually, I have you
to thank, my boy.

757
01:09:12,784 --> 01:09:15,747
Couldn't have done it
without you.

758
01:09:17,998 --> 01:09:20,083
Lock him up
with the others.

759
01:09:24,004 --> 01:09:26,548
Uh, that sounded
like Tarzan.

760
01:09:26,716 --> 01:09:28,927
He sounded like,
like he was in trouble.

761
01:09:29,052 --> 01:09:32,555
Yeah, well, why doesn't he get his new
friends to help him? I don't care.

762
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:35,934
That's it!

763
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:39,102
I've had it with you
and your emotional constipation!

764
01:09:39,270 --> 01:09:42,231
Tarzan needs us,
and we're gonna help him!

765
01:09:42,397 --> 01:09:46,235
You got that?
Now, pipe down and hang on tight.

766
01:09:46,401 --> 01:09:48,445
We've got a boat to catch.

767
01:09:57,413 --> 01:10:01,042
I've never felt so alive!

768
01:10:01,208 --> 01:10:03,461
Good!
'Cause I'm gonna kill ya!

769
01:10:03,628 --> 01:10:05,797
No time for that now,
missy.

770
01:10:26,734 --> 01:10:29,070
Tarzan, it's no use.
Don't!

771
01:10:35,784 --> 01:10:39,747
- Clayton.
- Yes, Clayton.

772
01:10:39,873 --> 01:10:41,999
Clayton betrayed us all.

773
01:10:42,124 --> 01:10:45,253
- I'm so sorry, Tarzan.
- No.

774
01:10:45,419 --> 01:10:49,257
I did this.
I betrayed my family.

775
01:10:49,382 --> 01:10:51,258
Kerchak was right.

776
01:10:51,383 --> 01:10:56,431
Oh, those magnificent creatures,
shivering in cages!

777
01:10:56,556 --> 01:10:59,100
What is this world
coming to?

778
01:11:03,104 --> 01:11:04,939
Oh.

779
01:11:05,064 --> 01:11:07,609
Oh, by Jove,
don't know my own strength.

780
01:11:12,779 --> 01:11:14,156
What was that?

781
01:11:14,281 --> 01:11:17,034
- You are an animal!

782
01:11:17,202 --> 01:11:20,622
- That sounded just like an elephant.

783
01:11:20,747 --> 01:11:23,624
- Tantor!

784
01:11:23,749 --> 01:11:29,338
- Thanks, guys.
- I thought I would never
see you again, and here you are!

785
01:11:29,504 --> 01:11:33,383
- Aah!
- Sometimes you embarrass me.

786
01:11:51,653 --> 01:11:54,071
- Hmm.

787
01:12:26,562 --> 01:12:28,230
Aah!

788
01:12:41,034 --> 01:12:43,788
Ah, I remember you.

789
01:12:45,582 --> 01:12:48,042
I think this one
will be better off stuffed.

790
01:13:02,723 --> 01:13:04,641
Charge!

791
01:13:06,019 --> 01:13:07,979
Aaarrgh!

792
01:13:10,190 --> 01:13:13,443
- You came back.
- I came home.

793
01:13:20,699 --> 01:13:22,659
Errr!

794
01:13:22,784 --> 01:13:25,288
Mm-hmm-hmm.
Aah!

795
01:13:25,454 --> 01:13:28,123
Heh-heh-heh!
Aah!

796
01:13:28,290 --> 01:13:30,627
Fire!

797
01:13:36,591 --> 01:13:40,512
You there! Take what you can
back to the boat!

798
01:13:42,846 --> 01:13:44,932
I've got some hunting
to do.

799
01:13:45,098 --> 01:13:46,684
Hey!

800
01:13:54,234 --> 01:13:56,110
Heh-heh.

801
01:14:04,535 --> 01:14:06,704
- Aah!

802
01:14:08,373 --> 01:14:10,499
- Don't worry.

803
01:14:10,624 --> 01:14:12,961
I'm going to have you
out of this in a second.

804
01:14:17,632 --> 01:14:20,968
Right.
This should do the trick.

805
01:14:35,607 --> 01:14:38,570
Ah.
Aaah!

806
01:14:42,990 --> 01:14:44,700
Hiding, are we?

807
01:14:44,868 --> 01:14:47,160
- Go on!
- Clayton, you...

808
01:14:47,287 --> 01:14:50,832
I could use a challenge
because after I get rid of you,

809
01:14:50,998 --> 01:14:55,753
rounding up your little ape family
will be all to easy!

810
01:15:22,488 --> 01:15:24,364
Go ahead, shoot me.

811
01:15:28,369 --> 01:15:31,288
Be a man.

812
01:15:36,211 --> 01:15:38,962
- Oh.
- Not a man like you!

813
01:15:42,758 --> 01:15:44,927
Aaah!

814
01:16:10,244 --> 01:16:12,788
Clayton!

815
01:16:12,913 --> 01:16:15,499
Clayton, don't!

816
01:16:21,713 --> 01:16:23,550
Agh!

817
01:16:30,472 --> 01:16:32,641
Oh, no.

818
01:17:06,551 --> 01:17:08,386
Tarzan.

819
01:17:08,552 --> 01:17:11,722
Kerchak...
forgive me.

820
01:17:13,016 --> 01:17:18,437
No. Forgive me
for not understanding...

821
01:17:18,562 --> 01:17:22,357
that you have always been
one of us.

822
01:17:24,276 --> 01:17:27,238
Our family
will look to you now.

823
01:17:29,489 --> 01:17:31,325
No, Kerchak.

824
01:17:31,492 --> 01:17:34,870
Take care of them,

825
01:17:34,995 --> 01:17:36,914
my son.

826
01:17:45,506 --> 01:17:48,717
Take care of them.

827
01:19:08,547 --> 01:19:12,886
London will seem so small
compared to all this.

828
01:19:13,011 --> 01:19:15,762
I will miss you,
Jane.

829
01:19:15,930 --> 01:19:19,434
- Miss Porter!
- I, I know. I'm coming.

830
01:19:19,559 --> 01:19:25,022
Well, I suppose we should say goodbye.

831
01:19:35,949 --> 01:19:38,494
Goodbye.

832
01:19:47,712 --> 01:19:51,507
Goodbye, Tarzan!
Goodbye.

833
01:19:51,632 --> 01:19:54,343
Oh, I'm going to miss
that boy.

834
01:20:03,477 --> 01:20:07,731
Jane, dear, I can't help feeling
that you should stay.

835
01:20:07,899 --> 01:20:12,611
Daddy, please don't. We've been through
all of this. I couldn't possibly st...

836
01:20:12,736 --> 01:20:17,074
I, I belong in England with you,
with people, and... Aah!

837
01:20:21,954 --> 01:20:24,540
But you love him.

838
01:20:28,586 --> 01:20:31,088
Go on.

839
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:47,605
- Oh.
- Oh!

840
01:20:54,863 --> 01:20:57,030
Uh...

841
01:20:57,155 --> 01:21:01,159
Thank you.
Thanks for getting my glove.

842
01:21:01,285 --> 01:21:03,162
Thank you.

843
01:21:12,462 --> 01:21:14,923
- Well...

844
01:21:18,552 --> 01:21:22,723
But, what...
What am I doing? Captain?

845
01:21:22,891 --> 01:21:24,976
Tell them that
you never found us. Eh?

846
01:21:25,142 --> 01:21:28,605
After all, people get lost
in the jungle every day. Right?

847
01:21:28,730 --> 01:21:30,565
Tootle-pip!

848
01:21:45,663 --> 01:21:48,749
Ooo-ooo-ee-ah-ooo.

849
01:21:50,251 --> 01:21:54,172
Put your faith
in what you most believe in

850
01:21:54,338 --> 01:21:58,092
Two worlds
One family

851
01:21:58,258 --> 01:22:02,096
Trust your heart
Let fate decide

852
01:22:02,221 --> 01:22:06,976
To guide these lives
To guide these lives we see

853
01:22:07,101 --> 01:22:11,105
Put your faith
in what you most believe in

854
01:22:11,230 --> 01:22:14,943
Two worlds
One family
