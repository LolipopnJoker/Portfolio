1
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,141
No!

2
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:32,647
I'm requesting… I am…

3
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:36,317
Captain, I'd like to request that it be me who's the attorney…

4
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:39,946
That it be myself who's assigned…

5
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:43,324
No, I'd like to request that it be I who am assigned…

6
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:49,372
That it be I who am assigned? That's confidence-inspiring.

7
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:56,087
Good grammar there. Captain, I'd like to request that I be the attorney assigned…

8
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,718
Hi, I'm Lieutenant Commander Galloway. I'm here to see Captain West.

9
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,178
Go right in, commander, they're expecting you.

10
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:05,388
Thank you.

11
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,853
Jo, come on in. Thank you, sir.

12
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,398
Captain West, this is Lieutenant Commander Galloway.

13
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,858
Jo, you know Commander Lawrence? Yes, sir.

14
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,735
Captain, I appreciate you seeing me on such short notice.

15
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,112
Would you like to sit down?

16
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,739
I'm fine, sir. Have a seat.

17
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,241
Okay.

18
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:27,493
I understand we had some trouble over the weekend down in Cuba?

19
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:30,246
Uh, yes, sir. This past Friday.

20
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:34,917
Two Marines, a Lance Corporal Harold Dawson and a Private Louden Downey,

21
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:39,088
entered the barracks room of a PFC William Santiago and assaulted him.

22
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:42,758
Santiago died at the base hospital approximately an hour later.

23
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:46,387
The NIS agent who took Dawson and Downey's statements

24
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,806
maintains they were trying to prevent Santiago

25
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:51,642
from naming Dawson in a fenceline shooting incident.

26
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,438
They're scheduled to have a hearing down in Cuba this afternoon at 1600.

27
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,772
What's the problem?

28
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,442
Dawson and Downey are both recruiting-poster Marines.

29
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,902
Santiago was known to be a screwup.

30
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,739
I was thinking it sounded an awful lot like a Code Red.

31
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,116
Christ!

32
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:10,870
Sir, I'd like to have them moved up to Washington and assigned counsel.

33
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,122
Someone who can really look into this.

34
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,624
Someone who possesses not only the legal skill

35
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:18,627
but a familiarity with the inner workings of the military.

36
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:23,424
In short, captain, I'd like to suggest that I be the one who that…

37
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:28,679
That it be me who is assigned to represent them, myself.

38
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:35,144
Why don't you get a cup of coffee? Thank you, sir, I'm fine.

39
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:38,439
I'd like you to leave the room, so we can talk about you behind your back.

40
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,067
Certainly, sir.

41
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:50,159
I thought this Code Red shit wasn't going on anymore.

42
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:53,454
With the Marines at Gitmo, who knows what the hell goes on down there?

43
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:57,458
We'd better find out before the rest of the world does. Damn thing could get messy.

44
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,169
What about this Commander Galloway?

45
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:05,257
She's been working a desk at Internal Affairs for, what, a little over a year now.

46
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,425
Before that?

47
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,469
She disposed of three cases in two years.

48
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,347
Three cases in two years? Who's she handling, the Rosenbergs?

49
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:14,016
She's not cut out for litigation. She's a hell of an investigator…

50
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:17,436
In Internal Affairs, sure. She can crawl up a lawyer's ass with the best of them.

51
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:18,687
When it comes to trial work…

52
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:22,858
I know, I know, all passion, no street smarts. Bring her back in.

53
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:29,740
Jo.

54
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,789
We're gonna have the defendants moved up here in the morning.

55
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:37,957
Thank you, sir.

56
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,126
And I'll have Division assign them counsel.

57
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,921
But not me?

58
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:47,508
Well, from what I understand from your colleagues, you're much too valuable

59
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:50,553
to be wasted on what I'm sure will boil down to a five-minute plea bargain

60
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,138
and a week's worth of paperwork.

61
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,683
Sir, there might be more involved. Don't worry about it.

62
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,811
I promise you, Division will assign the right man for the job.

63
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,230
All right, let's go, let's get two!

64
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:03,816
Sorry.

65
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:07,236
Nothing to be sorry about, Sherby. Look the ball into your glove.

66
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:11,490
Shooting two. Sorry.

67
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:16,412
You gotta trust me, Sherby. Keep your eyes open, your chances of catching increase by 10.

68
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,247
Kaffee. Let's try it again.

69
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:21,417
Kaffee! Dave, you seem distraught.

70
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:23,711
We were supposed to meet in your office 15 minutes ago.

71
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,754
You're stalling on the McDermott case.

72
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:30,718
We either get it done now, or I'll hang your boy from a fucking yardarm!

73
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:34,763
Yardarm? Sherby, does the Navy still hang people from yardarms?

74
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,098
I don't think so.

75
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:39,685
Sherby doesn't think the Navy does that anymore.

76
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:43,105
I'll charge him with possession and being under the influence while on duty.

77
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:47,443
You plead guilty, I'll recommend 30 days in the brig with loss of rank and pay.

78
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:52,406
It was 10 dollars' worth of oregano. Your client thought it was marijuana.

79
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:55,201
My client's a moron. That's not against the law.

80
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,621
I got people to answer to. I'm gonna charge him.

81
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,790
With possession of a condiment? Kaffee.

82
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:06,253
I tried to help you out of this, but if you ask for jail time, I'll file a motion to dismiss.

83
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,297
You won't get it. I will get it.

84
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:13,010
If not, I'll file a motion seeking to obtain an evidentiary ruling in advance,

85
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,763
and after that I'll file against pre-trial confinement.

86
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,307
You'll spend the next three months going blind on paperwork,

87
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:21,977
because a signalman bought and smoked a dime bag of oregano.

88
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,480
Let's go! Let's get two!

89
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:30,402
Twenty days in the brig. Fifteen days' restricted duty.

90
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,906
I don't know why I'm agreeing to this.

91
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,242
Because you have wisdom beyond your years.

92
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:43,457
- Good morning. - Good morning, captain.

93
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,167
How's the baby, Sam?

94
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:48,462
I think she's getting ready to say her first word any day now.

95
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,047
How can you tell?

96
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:53,842
She just looks like she has something to say.

97
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,512
Excuse me, sorry I'm late.

98
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,683
I know you don't have a good excuse, so I won't force you to come up with a bad one.

99
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:05,062
Thank you, sir. This first one's for you.

100
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:09,149
You're moving up in the world. You've been requested by Division.

101
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,359
Uh-oh.

102
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:14,405
Requested to do what? Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.

103
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,366
A Marine Corporal named Dawson illegally fires a round

104
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:21,412
from his weapon, over the fenceline and into Cuban territory.

105
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,455
What's a fenceline? Sam.

106
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:27,710
A big wall separating the good guys from the bad guys.

107
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,211
Teacher's pet.

108
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:32,298
PFC William Santiago threatens to rat on Dawson

109
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,508
to the Naval Investigative Service.

110
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:38,387
Dawson and another member of his squad, PFC Louden Downey,

111
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:41,724
go into Santiago's room, tie him up,

112
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,184
stuff a rag down his throat,

113
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,228
and an hour later, Santiago's dead.

114
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:50,149
Attending physician says the rag was treated with some kind of toxin.

115
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,901
They poisoned the rag? Not according to them.

116
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,404
What do they say? Not much.

117
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:58,407
They're being flown up tomorrow. On Wednesday at 0600,

118
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:02,578
you'll catch a transport down to Cuba for the day to find out what you can.

119
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:06,874
Meantime, go and see Lieutenant Commander JoAnne Galloway

120
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,543
with Internal Affairs.

121
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:12,254
Any questions? The flight to Cuba,

122
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,257
was that 0600 in the morning, sir?

123
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:21,263
Seems important to Division that this one be handled by the book, so I'm assigning co-counsel.

124
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:22,890
Any volunteers?

125
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,434
No. Sam…

126
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:28,854
Sir, I got a stack of papers… Work with Kaffee on this.

127
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,857
Doing what? He'll have this done in four days.

128
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:37,196
Doing various administrative things. Backup. Whatever.

129
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,907
In other words, I have no responsibilities?

130
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:41,200
Right.

131
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,494
My kind of case.

132
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:49,249
Right. Right. Okay, but I gotta have that report by Wednesday.

133
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:58,300
Hi. Hold on. Hi.

134
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:02,638
Daniel Kaffee. I was told to meet with, uh…

135
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:11,105
Lieutenant Commander Galloway.

136
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:17,611
About a briefing. I'll call you back.

137
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:21,281
You're the attorney Division assigned?

138
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,201
I'm lead counsel, this is Sam Weinberg.

139
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:28,622
I have no responsibilities whatsoever. Come in, please. Have a seat.

140
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,176
Lieutenant, how long have you been in the Navy?

141
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,805
Going on nine months now.

142
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:48,517
And how long have you been out of law school?

143
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,144
Little over a year.

144
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:53,939
I see. Have I done something wrong?

145
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:57,192
No. It's just that when I petitioned Division to have counsel assigned,

146
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,445
I was hoping I would be taken seriously.

147
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,197
No offense taken, in case you were wondering.

148
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:06,368
Lieutenant Kaffee is generally considered the best litigator in our office.

149
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:09,872
He successfully plea-bargained 44 cases in nine months.

150
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,834
One more, I get a set of steak knives. Have you ever been in a courtroom?

151
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,836
I once had my driver's license suspended…

152
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,422
Danny. If this thing goes to court,

153
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,716
they won't need a lawyer, they'll need a priest.

154
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:24,386
No, they'll need a lawyer.

155
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:30,017
Dawson's family's been contacted. Downey's closest relative is his aunt on his mother's side.

156
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:32,978
She hasn't been contacted yet, would you like me to do that?

157
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,563
Sure, if you feel like it.

158
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,402
One of the people you'll be seeing is the barracks CO, Colonel Nathan Jessep.

159
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,613
I assume you've heard of him.

160
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,199
Who hasn't?

161
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,909
He's been in the papers lately.

162
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,994
He's expected to be director of operations

163
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,288
of the National Security Council. Really?

164
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:54,416
These are the letters that Santiago wrote in his eight months at Gitmo.

165
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:57,252
That's Guantánamo Bay. I knew that one.

166
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,921
He wrote the fleet commander, HQ Atlantic,

167
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:02,090
the Marine commandant, even his senator.

168
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:05,552
He wanted to be transferred off the base. No one was listening. Are you with me?

169
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,262
Yeah.

170
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:10,933
Finally he wrote the Naval Investigative Service,

171
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,563
where he offered to trade information about Dawson's shooting for a transfer.

172
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:19,274
Right. Is that all?

173
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:23,779
This letter makes it look like your client had a motive to kill Santiago.

174
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:28,784
Got you. And Santiago is who? The victim.

175
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:30,285
Write that down.

176
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:34,456
Am I correct in assuming that these letters don't paint a flattering picture of Marine Corps life at Gitmo?

177
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:35,958
Yes, amon… And am I further right

178
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,878
that a protracted investigation might embarrass the Security Council guy?

179
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,673
Colonel Jessep… DANNY: Twelve years.

180
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,966
I'm sorry?

181
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:48,053
I'll get them to drop conspiracy and conduct unbecoming. Twelve years.

182
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,723
You haven't talked to a witness or looked at a piece of paper.

183
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,892
Pretty impressive, huh?

184
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,644
You're gonna have to go deeper than that.

185
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:58,480
Do you have some jurisdiction here I should know about?

186
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:01,275
My job is to make sure that you do your job.

187
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:06,822
I'm special counsel for Internal Affairs. So my jurisdiction's pretty much in your face.

188
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:12,077
Read the letters. I'll expect a report when you return from Cuba.

189
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,830
Sure. You're dismissed!

190
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,418
I always forget that part.

191
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,714
He's a little preoccupied.

192
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,842
Team's playing Bethesda Medical next week.

193
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:31,597
Tell your friend not to get cute down there. The Marines in Guantánamo are fanatical.

194
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,600
About what? About being Marines.

195
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,313
Dear sir, my name is PFC William T. Santiago.

196
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,523
I'm a Marine stationed at Marine barracks,

197
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:45,152
Rifle Security Company Windward, 2nd Platoon Bravo.

198
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,822
L am writing to inform you of my problems with my unit here in Cuba

199
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,574
and to ask for your help.

200
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:56,038
I've fallen out of runs before for several reasons, such as feeling dizzy or nauseated.

201
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:59,791
But on May 18th, I'd fallen back about 20 or 30 yards

202
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,502
going down a rocky, unstable hill.

203
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,422
My sergeant grabbed me and pushed me down the hill,

204
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:09,426
then I saw all black and the last thing I remember is hitting the deck.

205
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:12,846
L was brought to the hospital, where I was told I just had heat exhaustion.

206
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:18,101
L ask you to help me. Please, sir, I just need to be transferred out of RSC.

207
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:22,689
Sincerely, PFC William T. Santiago, U.S. Marine Corps.

208
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:26,860
P.S. ln exchange for my transfer off the base, I'm willing to provide you…

209
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:32,074
… with information about an illegal fenceline shooting that occurred the night of August the 2nd.

210
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:37,371
Who the fuck is PFC William T. Santiago?

211
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,582
Private Santiago's a member of 2nd Platoon Bravo, sir.

212
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:44,920
Yeah. Apparently he's not very happy down here at Shangri-la,

213
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:49,925
because he's written letters to everybody but Santa Claus, asking for a transfer.

214
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:55,597
Now he's telling tales about a fenceline shooting. Matthew?

215
00:16:56,057 --> 00:17:01,478
I'm appalled, sir. You're appalled.

216
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:05,941
This kid broke the chain of command and ratted on a member of his unit,

217
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:09,319
to say nothing of the fact that he is a U.S. Marine,

218
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:14,616
and it would appear he can't run from here to there without collapsing from heat exhaustion.

219
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:17,953
What the fuck is going on in Bravo company, Matthew?

220
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:21,039
Colonel, I think perhaps it would be better to hold this discussion in private.

221
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:25,252
That won't be necessary. I can handle this situation, sir.

222
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,754
Like you handled Curtis Bell? Sir, your methods…

223
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:29,047
Don't interrupt me, lieutenant.

224
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,590
I'm still your superior officer.

225
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,634
And I'm yours, Matthew.

226
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:37,889
I wanna know what we're going to do about this.

227
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,892
I think Santiago should be transferred off the base immediately.

228
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,644
He's that bad, huh?

229
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:46,815
Not only that, but word of this letter's bound to get out, and he's gonna get his ass whipped.

230
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:52,779
Hmm. Transfer Santiago? Yes.

231
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:57,075
Sure, you're right. I'm sure that's the thing to do.

232
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:02,831
Wait. Wait, I've got a better idea.

233
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:06,793
Let's transfer the whole squad off the base. Let's…

234
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:09,004
On second thought, Windward.

235
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:13,300
Let's transfer the whole Windward division off the base.

236
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:18,722
Jon, go get those boys down off the fence. They're packing their bags.

237
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,433
Tom! Sir?

238
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,477
Get me the president on the phone.

239
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,271
We're surrendering our position in Cuba.

240
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,774
- Yes, sir. - Wait a minute, Tom.

241
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:34,696
Don't get the president just yet. Maybe we should consider this for a second.

242
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:36,823
Dismissed, Tom. Yes, sir.

243
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:41,870
Maybe… And I'm just spit-balling here.

244
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:46,875
Maybe we have a responsibility as officers to train Santiago.

245
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:51,338
Maybe we, as officers, have a responsibility to this country

246
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:54,925
to see that the men and women charged with its security

247
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,885
are trained professionals.

248
00:18:57,053 --> 00:19:00,722
Yes, I'm certain that I read that somewhere once.

249
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,475
And now I'm thinking, Colonel Markinson,

250
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:07,729
that your suggestion of transferring Santiago,

251
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:11,107
while expeditious and certainly painless,

252
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:16,613
might not be, in a manner of speaking, the American way.

253
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:21,076
Santiago stays where he is.

254
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:26,456
We're gonna train the lad. Jon, you're in charge.

255
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:29,584
Santiago doesn't make 4.6, 4.6

256
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:33,421
on his next proficiency and conduct report,

257
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,924
and I'm going to blame you.

258
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:38,552
Then I'm going to kill you. Yes, sir.

259
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:41,221
I think that's a mistake, colonel.

260
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:46,935
Matthew, I think I will have that word in private with you now.

261
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:50,772
Jon, that's all. Why don't we meet at the O Club and have lunch,

262
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,650
and we'll talk about the training of young William.

263
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,528
I'd be delighted to hear your suggestions.

264
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,947
Dismissed. Yes, sir.

265
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:05,287
Matthew, sit down. Please.

266
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:13,044
What do you think of Kendrick?

267
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,963
Nathan, I don't think my opinion of Kendrick…

268
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:18,300
I think he's pretty much of a weasel myself.

269
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,260
But he's an awfully good officer,

270
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:24,764
and in the end, we see eye to eye on the best way to run a Marine unit.

271
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:28,310
We're in the business of saving lives, Matthew.

272
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:32,147
That is a responsibility that we have to take pretty seriously.

273
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:36,526
And I believe that taking a Marine who is not quite up to the job

274
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:41,156
and shipping him off to another assignment puts lives in danger.

275
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:44,159
Sit down, Matthew.

276
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,921
We go back a while.

277
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,214
We went to the Academy together,

278
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:01,843
we were commissioned together, did our tours in Vietnam together.

279
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:07,974
But I've been promoted up through the chain with greater speed and success than you have.

280
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:12,145
Now, if that's a source of tension or embarrassment for you,

281
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:14,189
I don't give a shit.

282
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:19,569
We're in the business of saving lives, Lieutenant Colonel Markinson.

283
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:23,615
Don't ever question my orders in front of another officer.

284
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:46,680
All the paperwork's in order. Step over there.

285
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,765
Yes, sir.

286
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:56,815
Hal, is this Washington D.C.? All right, let's move.

287
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,775
Yes, sir.

288
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:07,450
Got all of that one.

289
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:12,205
Excuse me. I wanted to talk to you about Dawson and Downey.

290
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:16,126
Say again? Dawson and Downey.

291
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,169
Those names sound like they should mean something to me, but…

292
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:21,047
Dawson. Downey. Your clients?

293
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:24,426
The Cuba thing! Yes! Oh, Dawson and Downey. Right.

294
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:29,681
I've done something wrong again, haven't I?

295
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:34,602
I was wondering why two guys have been locked up since this morning while their lawyer's out hitting a ball.

296
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,941
We need the practice. That wasn't funny.

297
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,068
It was a little funny.

298
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:47,490
Lieutenant, would you be very insulted if I recommended different counsel?

299
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:50,952
Why? I don't think you're fit to handle it.

300
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:57,459
You don't even know me. Ordinarily it takes someone hours to find that out.

301
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,589
Oh, come on. That was damn funny.

302
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:09,846
You're wrong. I do know you.

303
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:13,475
Daniel Alistair Kaffee, born June 8th, 1964,

304
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,602
at Boston Mercy Hospital.

305
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:22,317
Your father's Lionel Kaffee, former Attorney General of the U.S., died 1985.

306
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:25,320
You went to Harvard Law, then joined the Navy,

307
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:27,989
probably because that's what your father wanted.

308
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:31,785
Now you're just treading water for the three years in the JAG corps,

309
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:34,954
just laying low till you can get out and get a real job.

310
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:38,583
If that's the situation, that's fine, I won't tell anyone.

311
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:43,713
But if this case is handled in the same fast-food, slick-assed, Persian-bazaar manner

312
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:47,550
with which you seem to handle everything else, then something's gonna get missed.

313
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:52,889
And I wouldn't be doing my job if I allowed Dawson and Downey to sit in prison

314
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:57,519
because their attorney predetermined the path of least resistance.

315
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:00,730
Wow.

316
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:04,025
I'm sexually aroused, commander.

317
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,945
I don't think your clients murdered anyone.

318
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:10,365
What are you basing this on? There was no intent.

319
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:13,243
Doctor's report says that Santiago died of asphyxiation

320
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,078
brought on by acute lactic acidosis,

321
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:18,915
and the nature of the acidosis strongly suggests poisoning.

322
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,960
Now, I don't know what that means, but it sounds bad.

323
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:23,753
Santiago died at 1 a. m.

324
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:26,673
At 3, the doctor wasn't able to determine the cause of death.

325
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:29,050
Two hours later, he said it was poison.

326
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:31,553
Oh, now I see what you're saying.

327
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,056
It had to be Professor Plum, in the library, with the candlestick.

328
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,559
I'm gonna talk to your supervisor.

329
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:42,397
Go straight up Pennsylvania Avenue. It's the big white house with the pillars in front.

330
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:45,316
Thank you. I don't think you'll have much luck.

331
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:50,238
I was assigned by Division. Somebody over there thinks I'm a pretty good lawyer.

332
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:56,411
So, while I appreciate your interest and enthusiasm, I think I can handle things.

333
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:58,580
You know what a Code Red is?

334
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,586
What a pity.

335
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:17,098
Morning, sir. Morning.

336
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,310
Officer on deck, ten-hut!

337
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,312
Sir! Lance Corporal Harold Dawson, sir!

338
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:25,064
Rifle Security Company Windward! Second Platoon Bravo!

339
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,692
Someone hasn't been working and playing well with others, Harold.

340
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,777
Sir! Yes, sir!

341
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:35,158
Sir! PFC Louden Downey, sir!

342
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:39,120
I'm Daniel Kaffee, this is Sam Weinberg. Sit down.

343
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:49,047
Is this your signature? Yes, sir.

344
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:51,132
You don't have to call me sir. Is this your signature?

345
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:55,470
Sir, yes, sir! Certainly don't need to say it twice.

346
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:58,932
What's a Code Red? It's a disciplinary engagement.

347
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,475
What's that mean exactly?

348
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:04,437
Sir, a Marine falls out of line, it's up to the men in his unit to get him on track.

349
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:07,982
What's a garden-variety Code Red? Sir?

350
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:14,489
Harold, You say sir and I look for my father. Danny, Daniel Kaffee.

351
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:17,784
Garden-variety. Typical. What's a basic Code Red?

352
00:26:17,952 --> 00:26:20,411
Sir, a Marine refuses to bathe on a regular basis,

353
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:23,164
the men in his squad would give him a GI shower.

354
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:27,085
What's that? Scrub brushes, steel wool.

355
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:28,503
Beautiful.

356
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:31,089
Was the attack on Santiago a Code Red?

357
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:32,840
Yes, sir.

358
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:41,266
Does he ever talk?

359
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,602
Sir, PFC Downey will answer any direct questions you ask him.

360
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,187
Swell.

361
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:51,859
Private Downey, the rag you stuffed in Santiago's mouth, was there poison on it?

362
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:55,238
No, sir. Silver polish, turpentine, antifreeze?

363
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:57,657
No, sir. We were just gonna shave his head, sir.

364
00:26:57,825 --> 00:27:00,493
When, all of the sudden…

365
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:03,830
We saw blood dripping down his mouth.

366
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:07,375
We pulled the tape off and there was blood all down his face, sir.

367
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:10,586
That's when Lance Corporal Dawson called the ambulance.

368
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:12,380
Did anyone see you call the ambulance?

369
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:15,550
No, sir.

370
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,762
Were you there when the ambulance got there?

371
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:22,265
Yes, that's when we were taken under arrest.

372
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:28,479
On August 2nd, did you fire a shot across the fenceline, into Cuba?

373
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:30,481
Yes, sir. Why?

374
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:33,359
My mirror engaged, sir. His mirror?

375
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:37,280
For every American sentry, there's a Cuban counterpart. They're called mirrors.

376
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:40,825
Lance corporal claims his mirror was about to fire at him.

377
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:46,039
Santiago's letter to the NIS said you fired illegally.

378
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:51,586
He's saying that the guy, the mirror, he never made a move.

379
00:27:55,382 --> 00:28:00,595
Oh, Harold? You see what I'm getting at?

380
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:04,265
If Santiago didn't have anything on you, then why did you give him a Code Red?

381
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:06,476
Because he broke the chain of command, sir.

382
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:09,729
He what? He went outside of his unit.

383
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:14,233
If he had a problem, he should have spoken to me, then his sergeant, then…

384
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:17,904
All right, all right. Did you assault Santiago with the intent of killing him?

385
00:28:18,072 --> 00:28:19,614
No, sir. What was your intent?

386
00:28:19,782 --> 00:28:22,408
To train him, sir. Train him to do what?

387
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:27,038
To think of his unit before himself. To respect the code.

388
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:30,958
What's the code? Unit, Corps, God, country!

389
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:37,256
I beg your pardon? Unit, Corps, God, country, sir.

390
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:59,487
The government of the United States wants to charge you two with murder.

391
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:05,076
And you want me to go to the prosecutor with, unit, Corps, God, country?

392
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,161
That's our code, sir.

393
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,000
That's your code. That's your code.

394
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:15,711
We'll be back.

395
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:19,632
You guys need anything? Books? Papers? Cigarettes? Ham sandwich?

396
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,926
Sir! No, thank you, sir!

397
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:25,805
Harold, I think there's a concept you'd better start warming up to.

398
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:29,809
Sir? I'm the only friend you've got.

399
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:46,200
Dan Kaffee. Smiling Jack Ross.

400
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,536
Welcome to the big time. You think so?

401
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:52,457
Let's hope, for Dawson and Downey's sake, you practice law better than you play softball.

402
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,877
Unfortunately for Dawson and Downey, I don't do anything better than I play softball.

403
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,503
- I'm out of here, Jannelle! - Bye.

404
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:58,921
See you when I get back from Cuba.

405
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:02,300
Say hi to Castro for me. Will do. What are we looking at?

406
00:30:02,468 --> 00:30:05,553
They plead guilty, we drop conspiracy and conduct unbecoming,

407
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,180
20 years, they're home in half that time.

408
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:08,473
I want 12. Can't do it.

409
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,932
They called the ambulance, Jack.

410
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,561
I don't care if they called the Avon lady. They killed a Marine.

411
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:17,857
The rag was tested for poison. The autopsy, lab reports, they all say the same thing: Maybe, maybe not.

412
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:22,403
The Chief of Internal Medicine at Guantánamo says he's sure.

413
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:24,280
What do you know about Code Reds?

414
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:27,617
Oh, man…

415
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:32,246
Are we off the record? You tell me.

416
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:34,248
I'm gonna give you the 12 years.

417
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:37,251
But before you get into trouble tomorrow, I think you should know

418
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:41,047
the platoon commander, Kendrick, held a meeting with the men

419
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:45,551
and specifically told them not to touch Santiago.

420
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:50,598
We still playing hoops tomorrow? Do we have a deal?

421
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,392
I'll talk to you when I get back.

422
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,105
Hi there.

423
00:30:58,273 --> 00:30:59,982
Any luck getting me replaced?

424
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,735
Is there anyone in this command you don't drink or play softball with?

425
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:04,779
Commander… Listen, I came to make peace.

426
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:06,447
We got off on the wrong foot.

427
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:09,075
What do you say, friends? Look, I don't…

428
00:31:09,243 --> 00:31:12,578
I brought Downey some comic books he was asking for.

429
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:16,624
The kid, Kaffee, I swear, doesn't know where he is. Doesn't even know why he's been arrested.

430
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:19,794
Commander… JoAnne. You can call me JoAnne. Or Jo.

431
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:21,254
Jo? Yes.

432
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:24,382
Jo, if you ever speak to a client of mine again without permission,

433
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:27,134
I'll have you disbarred. Friends?

434
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:30,179
I had authorization. From where?

435
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:35,518
Downey's closest relative, Ginny Miller, his aunt on his mother's side.

436
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:38,145
You got authorization from Aunt Ginny?

437
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:42,275
I gave her a call, like you asked. Very nice woman. We spoke for about an hour.

438
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:45,319
You got authorization from Aunt Ginny.

439
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:47,697
Perfectly within my province.

440
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:50,575
Does Aunt Ginny have a barn? We could hold the trial there.

441
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:54,996
I can sew the costumes, Uncle Goober can be the judge.

442
00:31:57,207 --> 00:32:00,501
I'm going to Cuba with you tomorrow.

443
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:05,339
And the hits just keep on coming.

444
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:29,155
How's it going, Luther?

445
00:32:29,323 --> 00:32:31,198
Another day, another dollar.

446
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:34,368
Gotta play them as they lay. What goes around comes around.

447
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:37,788
Can't beat them, join them. At least I got my health.

448
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:41,626
Well, you got everything. See you tomorrow, Luther.

449
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,712
Not if I see you first.

450
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:50,343
You're my witness. The baby spoke. My daughter said a word.

451
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,887
She made a sound. I'm not sure it was a word.

452
00:32:53,055 --> 00:32:55,890
Come on, now. It was definitely a word.

453
00:32:56,058 --> 00:32:57,433
Okay.

454
00:32:57,643 --> 00:33:02,730
You heard her. She pointed and said Pa. She did.

455
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:05,608
She was pointing at a mailbox. That's right.

456
00:33:05,776 --> 00:33:09,445
Pointing as if to say, Pa! Look, a mailbox.

457
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:20,831
Jack Ross offered me the 12 years. That's what you wanted, right?

458
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,250
I know, and I'll…

459
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:28,631
I mean, I guess I'll take it. I'll take it.

460
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,549
So. .?

461
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:33,761
It took about 45 seconds. He barely put up a fight.

462
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:37,765
Danny, take the 12 years, it's a gift.

463
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:39,767
You don't believe their story, do you?

464
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:42,103
You think they ought to go to jail for life.

465
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,146
I believe every word of their story,

466
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:48,192
and I think they ought to go to jail for life.

467
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:54,782
See you tomorrow. Okay.

468
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,451
Don't forget to wear the whites. Very hot.

469
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:59,078
I don't like the whites.

470
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:02,832
Nobody likes the whites, but we're going to Cuba. You got Dramamine?

471
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,291
Dramamine keeps you cool?

472
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:07,962
No, Dramamine keeps you from throwing up. You get sick when you fly.

473
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:13,050
I get sick when I fly because I'm afraid of crashing into a large mountain. Dramamine won't help.

474
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:16,470
I got some oregano, I hear that works pretty good.

475
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:23,144
Ross said the strangest thing to me right before I left.

476
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:26,313
He said Lieutenant Kendrick

477
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:30,317
had told the men specifically not to touch Santiago.

478
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:33,988
So? I never mentioned Kendrick.

479
00:34:34,156 --> 00:34:36,407
I don't even know who he is.

480
00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:43,164
Ah, what the hell. I'll see you tomorrow.

481
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:24,330
I'm Corporal Barnes, I'm to escort you to the Windward side of the base.

482
00:35:24,498 --> 00:35:25,915
Thank you.

483
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:29,543
I got some camouflage jackets, I suggest you both put them on.

484
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:31,045
Camouflage jackets?

485
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:34,381
Yes, sir. We'll be riding pretty close to the fenceline.

486
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:40,554
If the Cubans see an officer in white, they might take a shot.

487
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:43,349
Good call, Sam.

488
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:50,564
We'll just hop on the ferry. We'll be there in no time.

489
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:54,860
Whoa, hold it. We gotta take a boat? Yes, sir, to get across the bay.

490
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:57,988
No one said anything about a boat. Is there a problem, sir?

491
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,909
No, no problem, I'm just not that crazy about boats.

492
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:06,205
Jesus Christ, Kaffee, you're in the Navy, for crying out loud!

493
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:09,583
Nobody likes her very much. Yes, sir.

494
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:26,725
Nathan Jessep. Come on in. Thank you, sir.

495
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,895
Daniel Kaffee, I'm the attorney for Dawson and Downey.

496
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:32,106
This is Lieutenant Commander JoAnne Galloway.

497
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:33,440
Pleasure meeting you.

498
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:37,987
Observing and evaluating. Lieutenant Sam Weinberg, he'll be assisting.

499
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:41,949
This is my XO, Colonel Markinson, and Platoon Leader Lieutenant Kendrick.

500
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:44,618
I've asked them to join us. Sit down, please.

501
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:47,329
Lieutenant Kaffee. Colonel Markinson.

502
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:49,665
I had the pleasure of meeting your father once.

503
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,876
I was a teenager. He spoke at my high school.

504
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:55,337
Lionel Kaffee? Yes, sir.

505
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:56,881
Well, what do you know?

506
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:01,552
Jon, this man's dad once made a lot of enemies in your neck of the woods.

507
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,431
Jefferson v. Madison County School District.

508
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,810
Folks down there said a little black girl couldn't go to an all-white school.

509
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:13,814
Lionel Kaffee said, We'll just see about that.

510
00:37:14,316 --> 00:37:18,903
How the hell is your dad, Danny? He passed away seven years ago.

511
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:24,909
Don't I feel like the fucking asshole. Not at all, sir.

512
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:31,790
What can we do for you, Danny? Not much, sir.

513
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:36,503
This is really a formality more than anything else.

514
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:39,465
JAG Corps insist we interview all the relevant witnesses.

515
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:42,676
The JAG Corps can be demanding that way.

516
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:48,182
Jon'll show you what you want to see. After that, we can all hook up for lunch.

517
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:50,559
How does that sound? Fine, sir.

518
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,029
I understand you had a meeting with your men that afternoon.

519
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:04,698
Yes, I did. What did you guys talk about?

520
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:06,951
I told them we had an informer among us

521
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,079
and that, despite any desire they had for retribution,

522
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:13,874
Private Santiago was not to be harmed in any way.

523
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:17,670
What time was that meeting? 1600.

524
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,546
That's 4:00.

525
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:14,101
We should make sure somebody gets this to his parents.

526
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:17,104
We don't need it anymore. Right.

527
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,607
Lieutenant Kendrick, may I call you Jon?

528
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:22,776
No, you may not.

529
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:24,945
Have I done something to offend you?

530
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:27,197
No, I like all you Navy boys.

531
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:31,285
Every time we gotta go fight, you fellas always give us a ride.

532
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:36,081
Lieutenant Kendrick, do you think Santiago was murdered?

533
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:41,295
I believe in God and Jesus Christ. Because I do, I can say this:

534
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:44,965
Private Santiago is dead, and that is a tragedy.

535
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:51,597
But he is dead because he had no code, and no honor. And God was watching.

536
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:58,145
How do you feel about that theory? Sounds good. Let's move on.

537
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:03,859
Are you planning on investigating, or you just gonna take the guided tour?

538
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:06,653
I'm pacing myself.

539
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:12,326
They were running around for hours looking for anything white to wave.

540
00:40:12,494 --> 00:40:15,537
Some of these people surrendered to a crew from CNN.

541
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:23,545
Walk softly and carry an armored tank division, I always say.

542
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:26,632
That was delicious. Thank you. My pleasure, sir.

543
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,512
Colonel, I do have to ask you a couple questions about September 6th.

544
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,180
Shoot.

545
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:35,724
You were contacted by an NIS agent

546
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:39,186
who said that Santiago had tipped him off to an illegal fenceline shooting.

547
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:41,522
Yes. Santiago was gonna reveal who did it

548
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,190
in exchange for a transfer.

549
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:45,526
Yes.

550
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:53,700
If you feel there are any details that I'm missing, feel free to speak up.

551
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:58,038
Thank you.

552
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:03,919
You called Lieutenant Colonel Markinson

553
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:07,005
and Lieutenant Kendrick into your office. Is that right?

554
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:09,508
Yes. And what happened then?

555
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:15,389
We agreed that, for his own safety, Santiago should be transferred.

556
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:19,518
Santiago was set to be transferred?

557
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:24,356
On the first flight to the States. 0600 the next morning.

558
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:28,527
Five hours too late, as it turned out.

559
00:41:29,863 --> 00:41:35,242
Yeah. All right, that's all. Thanks very much for your time.

560
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:38,537
The corporal's waiting outside with a jeep. He'll take you back.

561
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:40,330
Thank you, sir. Wait, I've got some questions.

562
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:41,498
No, you don't.

563
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,792
Yes, I do. No, you don't.

564
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,880
On the morning Santiago died, did you meet with Dr. Stone?

565
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,089
Jo.

566
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:53,135
Of course. One of my men was dead.

567
00:41:53,303 --> 00:41:55,762
You see? The man was dead. Let's go.

568
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:59,474
I'm just wondering if you've ever heard the term Code Red.

569
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,561
I've heard the term, yes.

570
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,480
This past February, you received a memo

571
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:08,192
from the Atlantic Fleet commander,

572
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:13,238
warning that enlisted men disciplining their own wasn't to be condoned.

573
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:16,158
I submit to you that whoever wrote that memo

574
00:42:16,326 --> 00:42:22,122
has never faced the working end of a Cuban AK-47 assault rifle.

575
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:25,792
However, the directive, having come from the commander,

576
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,753
I gave it its due attention.

577
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:29,254
What is your point, Jo?

578
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:34,092
She has no point, it's part of her charm. We're out of here. Thank you.

579
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:39,473
My point is that I think Code Reds still go on. Do they?

580
00:42:39,641 --> 00:42:42,309
Jo. He doesn't need to answer that. Yes, he does.

581
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:46,021
No, he really doesn't. Yeah, he really does.

582
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:48,982
Colonel?

583
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:53,737
You know, it just hit me.

584
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:57,699
She outranks you, Danny. Yes, sir.

585
00:42:57,867 --> 00:43:01,245
I want to tell you something. And listen up, because I mean this.

586
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:04,331
You're the luckiest man in the world.

587
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:08,335
There is nothing on this earth sexier… Believe me, gentlemen.

588
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:11,505
…Than a woman you have to salute in the morning.

589
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:15,467
Promote them all, I say, because this is true.

590
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:20,138
If you haven't gotten a blowjob from a superior officer, well,

591
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:23,183
you're just letting the best in life pass you by.

592
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:28,063
The practice of Code Reds is still condoned on this base, isn't it?

593
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:31,483
My problem is I'm a colonel, so I'll just have to take cold showers

594
00:43:31,651 --> 00:43:33,360
until they elect some gal president.

595
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:36,697
I need an answer to my question, sir.

596
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:40,367
Take caution in your tone, commander.

597
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:46,665
I'm a fair guy, but this fucking heat is making me absolutely crazy.

598
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:49,293
You wanna ask me about Code Reds?

599
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,045
On the record, I tell you I discourage the practice

600
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:54,214
in accordance with the directive.

601
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:59,428
Off the record, I tell you it is an invaluable part of infantry training.

602
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:06,393
If it goes on without my knowledge, so be it. I run my unit how I run my unit.

603
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:11,064
You want to investigate me, roll the dice and take your chances.

604
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:15,610
I eat breakfast 300 yards from 4000 Cubans who are trained to kill me.

605
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:20,741
So don't think for one second that you can come down here, flash a badge

606
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:23,285
and make me nervous.

607
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,624
Let's go.

608
00:44:32,045 --> 00:44:35,505
Colonel, I'll just need a copy of Santiago's transfer order.

609
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:37,174
What's that?

610
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:40,594
Santiago's transfer order. You guys have paperwork on it.

611
00:44:40,762 --> 00:44:42,387
I just need it for the file.

612
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:45,432
For the file? Yeah.

613
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:51,938
Of course you can have a copy of the transfer order for the file.

614
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:55,275
I'm here to help in any way I can. Thank you.

615
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:59,363
You believe that, don't you, Danny? That I'm here to help you in any way I can?

616
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:01,698
Of course.

617
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:07,120
The corporal will take you by Personnel on your way to the flight line,

618
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:10,207
and you can have all the transfer orders that you want.

619
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,461
But you have to ask me nicely.

620
00:45:16,798 --> 00:45:21,468
I beg your pardon? You have to ask me nicely.

621
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:24,971
See, I can deal with the bullets, the bombs and the blood.

622
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:27,974
I don't want money and I don't want medals.

623
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:32,604
What I do want is for you to stand there, in that faggoty white uniform,

624
00:45:32,772 --> 00:45:37,275
and with your Harvard mouth, extend me some fucking courtesy.

625
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:42,489
You got to ask me nicely.

626
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:48,829
Colonel Jessep, if it's not too much trouble,

627
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:52,666
I'd like a copy of the transfer order. Sir.

628
00:45:55,795 --> 00:45:57,754
No problem.

629
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:42,048
- Who is it? - It's me.

630
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,092
Jo.

631
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:49,055
I've really missed you. I was just saying, it's been three hours…

632
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:51,808
Markinson's disappeared. What?

633
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:55,187
Colonel Markinson's gone U.A. Unauthorized Absence.

634
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:59,483
I know what it means. When? This afternoon, after we left.

635
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,360
I'll try to find him in the morning. I've already tried.

636
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:03,904
You tried?

637
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:10,911
You're coming close to interfering with a government investigation.

638
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:17,417
I'm Louden Downey's attorney. Aunt Ginny feels like she knows me.

639
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:22,005
So I suggested that I get more directly involved with the case.

640
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:25,717
She had Louden sign the papers about an hour ago.

641
00:47:25,885 --> 00:47:30,055
I suppose it's too much to hope that you're making this up just to bother me.

642
00:47:30,223 --> 00:47:35,227
Don't worry, you're still lead counsel. Splendid.

643
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:38,104
I think Kendrick ordered the Code Red, and so do you.

644
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:41,900
Let's go.

645
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,611
Sir.

646
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:47,656
Officer on deck, ten-hut!

647
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,699
Did Kendrick order the Code Red? Sir?

648
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:53,411
Don't say sir like I just asked you if you cleaned the latrine.

649
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:57,749
Did Lieutenant Kendrick order you to give Santiago a Code Red?

650
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:00,126
Yes, sir.

651
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:03,922
Did he? Yes, sir.

652
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:13,473
Why didn't you mention this before? You didn't ask us, sir.

653
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:18,478
Corporal, I get paid no matter how much time you spend in jail.

654
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:20,605
Yes, sir. I know you do, sir.

655
00:48:20,773 --> 00:48:22,816
- Fuck you, Harold! - All right.

656
00:48:23,985 --> 00:48:28,488
- At ease. Let's sort this thing out. - Shit.

657
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:31,950
There was a platoon meeting on September 6th at 4 p. m.

658
00:48:32,118 --> 00:48:36,454
Lieutenant Kendrick says he told you nothing was to happen to Santiago.

659
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:39,040
Now, is this true?

660
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:42,294
I want you to speak freely.

661
00:48:45,214 --> 00:48:49,509
Ma'am, that's correct. But then he dismissed the platoon.

662
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:50,927
And what happened then?

663
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:53,597
Lieutenant Kendrick came to our room.

664
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,473
When?

665
00:48:56,350 --> 00:49:00,478
About five minutes after the meeting broke. About 1620.

666
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:03,148
And what happened then?

667
00:49:03,316 --> 00:49:07,527
Lieutenant Kendrick ordered us to give Santiago a Code Red.

668
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:13,617
Jack! Jack! They were given an order.

669
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:22,042
Jack, come on. I'll be right back. Be right back.

670
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:23,877
How long did you know about the order?

671
00:49:24,045 --> 00:49:25,712
I didn't. Who's this?

672
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:29,257
It's Jo Galloway, Downey's lawyer. She's very pleased to meet you.

673
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:32,552
What are you accusing me of? How long have you known?

674
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:37,390
He didn't know. If he did and didn't tell us, he'd be violating the code of ethics.

675
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:38,892
He's got enough to worry about.

676
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:41,019
God forbid our clients plead not guilty

677
00:49:41,187 --> 00:49:43,355
and testify for the record they were ordered.

678
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:46,650
Kendrick told those men not to touch Santiago.

679
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,736
And then he told Dawson and Downey to give him a Code Red.

680
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:51,237
That's not what Kendrick says. Kendrick's lying.

681
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:52,864
You have proof? I have the defendants.

682
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:57,410
And I have 23 Marines and a lieutenant with four letters of commendation.

683
00:49:57,578 --> 00:49:59,871
Why did Markinson go U.A.? We'll never know.

684
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:02,749
I can't subpoena Markinson? You won't find him.

685
00:50:03,084 --> 00:50:08,296
You know what Markinson did for 17 years? Counterintelligence.

686
00:50:08,464 --> 00:50:11,257
Markinson's gone. There is no Markinson.

687
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:17,430
Look, Danny, Jessep's star is on the rise.

688
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:21,393
Division will give me room to spare him and the Corps any embarrassment.

689
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,769
How much room?

690
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:27,524
I'll knock it down to involuntary manslaughter. Two years.

691
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:28,983
- No deal, we're going to court. - Jo.

692
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:30,944
No, you're not. Why not?

693
00:50:31,112 --> 00:50:34,030
Because you'll lose, and Danny knows it.

694
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:37,117
And he knows if we go to court, I'll have to go all the way.

695
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:39,536
They'll be charged with the whole truckload.

696
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:42,205
Murder, conspiracy, conduct unbecoming.

697
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:47,127
Danny's got me by the balls here, but not in the courtroom.

698
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:49,087
Danny's an awfully talented lawyer.

699
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:54,134
He won't see his clients go to jail for life if they could be home in six months.

700
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:56,803
That's the end of this negotiation.

701
00:50:57,555 --> 00:51:00,056
I'll see you tomorrow morning at the arraignment.

702
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:06,104
All right, here's the story.

703
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:11,151
The government's offering involuntary manslaughter. Two years.

704
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:13,236
You'll be home in six months.

705
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:22,537
Wow, Kaffee! You're the greatest lawyer in the world! Ooh, how can we thank you?

706
00:51:22,747 --> 00:51:28,626
Fellas, you hear what I just said? You'll be home in six months.

707
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:30,879
I'm afraid we can't do that, sir.

708
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:32,297
Do what?

709
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:35,842
Make a deal, sir. What are you talking about?

710
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:38,803
We did nothing wrong, sir. We did our job.

711
00:51:38,971 --> 00:51:42,223
If that has consequences, then I'll accept them.

712
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:44,476
But I won't say that I'm guilty, sir.

713
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:49,355
Did she put you up to this? No.

714
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:51,107
We have a code, sir.

715
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:56,362
You and your code plead not guilty, you'll be in jail for the rest of your life.

716
00:51:56,530 --> 00:52:00,492
Do what I say, and you'll be home in six months.

717
00:52:01,327 --> 00:52:05,872
Do it, Harold. Six months, it's nothing. It's a hockey season.

718
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:12,212
Permission to… Speak! Jesus!

719
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:17,217
What do we do then, sir? When?

720
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:20,720
After six months we'll be dishonorably discharged, right, sir?

721
00:52:20,888 --> 00:52:25,391
Probably. What do we do then, sir?

722
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:33,900
We joined the Marines because we wanted to live by a certain code. And we found it in the Corps.

723
00:52:34,068 --> 00:52:39,405
You're asking us to say we have no honor, that we're not Marines!

724
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:43,868
If a court decides what we did was wrong, I'll accept my punishment.

725
00:52:44,036 --> 00:52:49,749
But I believe I was right. I did my job. I will not dishonor myself, my unit,

726
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:55,046
or the Corps, so that I can go home in six months!

727
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:57,048
Sir!

728
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:08,434
I'd like to talk to Lance Corporal Dawson alone for a minute, please.

729
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:11,437
Sergeant!

730
00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:14,399
We're gonna go in another room.

731
00:53:14,567 --> 00:53:19,153
- We'd like to go in another room. - Sit down.

732
00:53:26,662 --> 00:53:28,329
You, uh…

733
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:32,876
You don't like me very much, do you?

734
00:53:34,378 --> 00:53:38,590
Forget it, don't answer that. It doesn't matter.

735
00:53:43,804 --> 00:53:48,892
You know, Downey worships you.

736
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:53,563
He's gonna do whatever you do.

737
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:59,485
Are you really gonna let this happen to him because of a code, Harold?

738
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:01,821
Do you think we were right? Doesn't matter…

739
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:03,406
Do you think we were right?!

740
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:05,992
I think you'd lose.

741
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,704
You're such a coward.

742
00:54:09,872 --> 00:54:12,498
I can't believe they let you wear a uniform.

743
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:17,754
I'm not gonna feel responsible for this. I did all I could.

744
00:54:17,922 --> 00:54:24,135
You're going to Leavenworth for the better part of your life, and I don't give a shit.

745
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:28,181
What happened to saluting an officer when he leaves the room?

746
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:37,357
Open it up.

747
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:44,614
I don't believe it! He's gonna go to jail just to spite me!

748
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:47,533
Fine. If he wants to jump off a cliff, that's his business.

749
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,369
I'm not gonna hold his hand.

750
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:53,915
How do I get him a new lawyer? Make a motion at the arraignment.

751
00:54:54,083 --> 00:54:58,378
Just tell the judge you want new counsel assigned.

752
00:55:00,047 --> 00:55:01,381
That's that.

753
00:55:02,091 --> 00:55:04,717
One thing, though. When you ask the judge for new counsel,

754
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:06,719
Danny, be sure and ask nicely.

755
00:55:07,596 --> 00:55:08,888
What do you want from me?

756
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:13,559
I want you to let them be judged. I want you to stand up and make an argument.

757
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:18,523
That didn't help Calley at My Lai, or the Nazis at Nuremburg.

758
00:55:18,691 --> 00:55:21,901
For chrissakes, Sam. Do you think that's the same

759
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:25,446
as two teenagers executing an order they didn't think would result in harm?

760
00:55:25,614 --> 00:55:27,490
These guys aren't Nazis.

761
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:30,576
Don't look now, but you're making an argument.

762
00:55:32,246 --> 00:55:35,873
Yeah, yeah. Tomorrow morning, I get them a new attorney.

763
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:40,336
Why are you so afraid to be a lawyer? Were Daddy's expectations really that high?

764
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:43,756
Please, spare me the psychobabble father bullshit!

765
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:47,427
They'll have their day in court, but with another lawyer.

766
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:52,056
Another lawyer won't be good enough. They need you. You know how to win.

767
00:55:52,224 --> 00:55:56,602
You know they have a case. You walk away from this, you seal their fate.

768
00:55:56,770 --> 00:56:00,064
Their fate was sealed the moment Santiago died.

769
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:01,899
Do you believe they have a case?

770
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:04,944
You and Dawson, you both live in the same dream world.

771
00:56:05,112 --> 00:56:09,157
It doesn't matter what I believe, it only matters what I can prove.

772
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:13,953
So don't tell me what I know and don't know. I know the law!

773
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:23,171
You know nothing about the law. You're a used-car salesman.

774
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:29,552
An ambulance-chaser with a rank. You're nothing. Live with that.

775
00:56:35,684 --> 00:56:37,310
So I told Duncan,

776
00:56:37,478 --> 00:56:41,481
If you wanna take this to court, you'll force me to file discovery motions,

777
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:45,151
and you're gonna spend a year going blind on paperwork

778
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:48,488
because a 90-year-old man misread the Delaware insurance code.

779
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:49,864
So, what happened?

780
00:56:50,032 --> 00:56:53,951
Fifteen minutes later, he makes a deal.

781
00:57:40,124 --> 00:57:42,333
All rise.

782
00:57:49,091 --> 00:57:55,346
Where are we? Docket number 411275 VR-5.

783
00:57:55,514 --> 00:57:58,099
The United States v. Lance Corporal Harold W. Dawson

784
00:57:58,267 --> 00:58:00,476
and Private First Class Louden Downey.

785
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:03,896
The accused are charged with murder, conspiracy to commit murder,

786
00:58:04,064 --> 00:58:06,315
and conduct unbecoming a United States Marine.

787
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,526
Does the defense wish to enter a plea?

788
00:58:10,279 --> 00:58:11,737
Yeah.

789
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:16,826
They're not guilty.

790
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,665
Enter a plea of not guilty for the accused.

791
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:29,589
We will adjourn until 1000, three weeks from today, when we will reconvene.

792
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:49,066
Why does a lieutenant with nine months' experience

793
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:53,487
and a track record for plea-bargaining get assigned a murder case?

794
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:59,785
Would it be so that it never sees the inside of a courtroom?

795
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:02,830
We'll work out of my apartment every night at 7:00.

796
00:59:02,998 --> 00:59:07,543
Jo, pick up a carton of legal pads, half a dozen boxes of red pens, half a dozen boxes of black pens.

797
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:11,088
Sam, get a couple desk lamps. I need you to start a medical profile.

798
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:15,134
Jo, get Dawson's, Downey's and Santiago's conduct reports.

799
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:19,597
I've only got Yoo-hoo and Cocoa Puffs, so if you want anything else, bring it.

800
00:59:19,765 --> 00:59:21,891
Okay? Yeah.

801
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:31,234
So this is what a courtroom looks like.

802
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:43,996
Did you speak to your friend at the NIS?

803
00:59:44,164 --> 00:59:45,164
Yeah.

804
00:59:45,332 --> 00:59:49,669
She said if Markinson doesn't want to be found, we won't find him.

805
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:52,630
She said I could be Markinson, and you wouldn't know it.

806
00:59:54,258 --> 00:59:58,594
Are you Markinson? No.

807
00:59:58,804 --> 01:00:03,683
I'm not Markinson. That's two down.

808
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:07,770
What?

809
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:11,941
I'm just wondering, now that JoAnne's on this…

810
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:14,819
I'm just wondering if you still need me.

811
01:00:14,987 --> 01:00:17,530
They were following orders, Sam. An illegal order.

812
01:00:17,698 --> 01:00:19,991
You think Dawson and Downey knew it was illegal?

813
01:00:20,242 --> 01:00:22,827
It doesn't matter. Any decent human would have…

814
01:00:22,995 --> 01:00:25,705
They're not permitted to question orders.

815
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:30,501
Then what's the secret? I give orders every day, nobody obeys!

816
01:00:30,669 --> 01:00:32,378
We have softball and marching bands.

817
01:00:32,546 --> 01:00:36,799
They work at a place where you have to wear camouflage or you might get shot.

818
01:00:44,516 --> 01:00:48,769
I need you. You're better at research than I am.

819
01:00:48,937 --> 01:00:51,564
And you know how to prepare a witness.

820
01:00:56,987 --> 01:01:01,741
I've got medical reports and Chinese food. I say we eat first.

821
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:08,664
What?

822
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:13,711
Did you get any kung pao chicken?

823
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:19,425
This is our defense. Intent. No one can prove there was poison on the rag.

824
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:22,720
Code Red. They're common and accepted in Guantánamo Bay.

825
01:01:22,888 --> 01:01:28,351
The order. A, Kendrick gave it, B, they had no choice but to follow. That's it.

826
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,895
- What about motive? - We're weak. They had one.

827
01:01:31,063 --> 01:01:33,105
That doesn't make them guilty.

828
01:01:33,273 --> 01:01:36,776
Relax. We'll deal with that later. For now, we start with intent.

829
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:41,906
We must show that Santiago could have died from something other than poison.

830
01:01:42,074 --> 01:01:46,452
Jo, find out everything about lactic acidosis.

831
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:49,163
This is Lieutenant Commander Galloway with the JAG Corps.

832
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:53,125
I've been trying to track down a Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Markinson…

833
01:01:53,293 --> 01:01:54,752
Doctor, was there any sign of external damage?

834
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:57,296
No. No scrapes? No cuts?

835
01:01:57,464 --> 01:02:00,466
No. No. Bruises? Broken bones?

836
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:02,635
Was there any sign of violence?

837
01:02:02,803 --> 01:02:07,473
Other than the dead body? Shit. I walk into that every time.

838
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:12,186
He ordered me and Dawson to give Willy a Code Red.

839
01:02:12,354 --> 01:02:13,979
Answers still have to come faster.

840
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:16,148
This Iowa farm boy thing will play for a while,

841
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:18,901
but in the end, it sounds like he's searching for the truth.

842
01:02:19,069 --> 01:02:20,986
He's right. And Willy is Private Santiago.

843
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:25,491
You start calling him Willy and all the sudden he's a person who's got a mother who's gonna miss him.

844
01:02:26,493 --> 01:02:27,785
They drew court members.

845
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:30,121
Seven men, two women. Five Navy, four Marines.

846
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:32,248
All experienced officers.

847
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:35,334
The women have no children. That's a bad break.

848
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:39,547
My father said a jury trial is about assigning blame.

849
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:44,218
Santiago's dead and he shouldn't be. They want to know who's to blame.

850
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:46,804
Ross hands them our clients, we hand them Kendrick.

851
01:02:46,972 --> 01:02:52,560
This won't be won by the law, but by the lawyers. So, poker faces.

852
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:57,940
Don't flinch. If something goes wrong, don't hang your head or scribble.

853
01:02:58,108 --> 01:03:01,777
Whatever happens, you have to look like you expected it.

854
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:03,154
You pass me documents…

855
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:06,740
Swiftly, and don't look overanxious.

856
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:09,618
Don't wear that perfume in court, it wrecks my concentration.

857
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:13,414
Really? I was talking to Sam.

858
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:18,294
What time is it? It's time to go home. Try to sleep.

859
01:03:18,837 --> 01:03:20,212
Yeah. Give me a ride?

860
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:22,214
Sure.

861
01:03:25,427 --> 01:03:26,969
You're a good man, Charlie Brown.

862
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:31,223
I'll see you in court, counselor.

863
01:03:36,438 --> 01:03:39,899
Danny, I… I know. We've had our differences.

864
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:44,778
We both said things we didn't mean. But you're happy I stuck with the case.

865
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:51,076
If you've gained some respect for me, well, of course I'm happy about that.

866
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:55,581
But it's no big deal. You like me, I won't make you say it.

867
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:59,084
I was just gonna tell you to wear matching socks tomorrow.

868
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:04,340
Okay. Good tip.

869
01:04:05,133 --> 01:04:08,886
We're ready. Better believe it.

870
01:04:19,022 --> 01:04:22,024
We're gonna get creamed.

871
01:04:50,095 --> 01:04:52,012
Lieutenant Kaffee.

872
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:55,891
You are gonna save our son, aren't you?

873
01:04:56,059 --> 01:04:58,060
I'll do my best.

874
01:04:58,228 --> 01:05:02,648
Danny, I'd like you to meet Ginny Miller, Louden's aunt.

875
01:05:03,525 --> 01:05:06,110
You're Aunt Ginny? Uh-huh.

876
01:05:07,821 --> 01:05:12,783
I was expecting someone older. So was I.

877
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:20,165
- Last chance. I'll flip you for it. - All rise.

878
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:21,333
Too late.

879
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:35,764
All those having business with this general court-martial, stand forward.

880
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:39,268
Colonel Julius Alexander Randolph is presiding.

881
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:41,854
Is the government prepared to make an opening statement?

882
01:05:42,022 --> 01:05:43,522
Yes, sir.

883
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:48,485
The facts of the case are these:

884
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:54,700
On September 6th, the accused entered PFC Santiago's room.

885
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:57,703
They woke him up, tied his arms and legs,

886
01:05:57,871 --> 01:06:00,205
and forced a rag into his throat.

887
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:06,045
Minutes later, a reaction called lactic acidosis caused his lungs to bleed.

888
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:11,717
He drowned in his own blood, and was dead at 37 minutes past midnight.

889
01:06:11,885 --> 01:06:16,889
These are the facts of the case, and they are undisputed.

890
01:06:17,057 --> 01:06:22,353
That's right. What I've just told you is exactly what you will hear

891
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:27,107
from Lance Corporal Dawson and Private Downey.

892
01:06:27,275 --> 01:06:32,321
Furthermore, we will also show that the accused soaked the rag in poison

893
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:36,408
and entered Santiago's room with motive and intent to kill.

894
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:43,040
Lieutenant Kaffee is gonna try and pull off a little magic act here.

895
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:45,584
He's gonna try a little misdirection.

896
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:49,296
He'll astonish you with stories of rituals.

897
01:06:49,464 --> 01:06:55,678
Dazzle you with official-sounding terms like Code Red.

898
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:58,806
He might even try to cut into a few officers for you.

899
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:03,727
He'll have no evidence, none, but it'll be entertaining.

900
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:05,396
When we get to the end,

901
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:10,150
all the magic in the world will not divert your attention from the fact

902
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:17,241
that Willy Santiago is dead, and Dawson and Downey killed him.

903
01:07:17,409 --> 01:07:21,245
These are the facts of the case, and they are undisputed.

904
01:07:22,372 --> 01:07:24,081
Lieutenant Kaffee.

905
01:07:24,249 --> 01:07:27,251
There was no poison on the rag and there was no intent to kill,

906
01:07:27,419 --> 01:07:31,463
and any attempt to prove otherwise is futile, because it just ain't true.

907
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:37,678
Dawson and Downey didn't go into Santiago's room because of vengeance or hatred.

908
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:41,849
It wasn't to kill or harm. And they weren't looking for kicks.

909
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:45,310
It's because it was what they were ordered to do.

910
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:50,482
Let me say that again. It's because it was what they were ordered to do.

911
01:07:51,109 --> 01:07:52,985
Out in the real world, that means nothing.

912
01:07:53,153 --> 01:07:55,487
And here in the Washington Navy Yard,

913
01:07:55,655 --> 01:07:57,281
doesn't mean a whole lot more.

914
01:07:57,449 --> 01:07:58,991
But if you're a Marine,

915
01:07:59,159 --> 01:08:03,454
assigned to Rifle Security Company Windward, Guantánamo Bay, Cuba,

916
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:06,999
you follow orders, or you pack your bags.

917
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:12,421
Make no mistake about it. Dawson and Downey are sitting here

918
01:08:12,589 --> 01:08:15,841
because they did their job.

919
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:22,514
Is the government ready to call its first witness?

920
01:08:22,682 --> 01:08:26,351
Please the court, government calls Mr. R.C. McGuire.

921
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:33,025
Raise your right hand, please.

922
01:08:33,193 --> 01:08:38,864
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?

923
01:08:39,032 --> 01:08:41,408
- McGUIRE: I do. - Have a seat, please.

924
01:08:42,494 --> 01:08:45,704
Would you state your full name and occupation?

925
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:48,874
Robert C. McGuire, special agent, Naval Investigative Service.

926
01:08:49,042 --> 01:08:50,209
Thank you.

927
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:56,715
Did you receive a letter from PFC Santiago on 3 September of this year?

928
01:08:56,883 --> 01:08:58,967
We did. What did it say?

929
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:03,847
That a member of Santiago's unit had illegally fired across the fenceline.

930
01:09:04,015 --> 01:09:06,058
Was that Marine identified in the letter?

931
01:09:06,226 --> 01:09:11,730
No. I told Colonel Jessep that I would be coming down to investigate.

932
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:13,565
And what did you find?

933
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:18,529
The shift reported only one sentry returned his weapon with ammo missing.

934
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:21,990
Who was that? Lance Corporal Harold Dawson.

935
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:23,742
Your Witness.

936
01:09:26,329 --> 01:09:29,665
Mr. McGuire, have you questioned Dawson about the shooting?

937
01:09:29,916 --> 01:09:33,544
Yes, he claims to have been engaged in some manner by the enemy.

938
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:35,963
But you don't believe him? It's not my place…

939
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:41,009
Why wasn't Dawson charged with firing at the enemy without cause?

940
01:09:42,804 --> 01:09:45,681
There wasn't enough evidence to support such a charge.

941
01:09:45,849 --> 01:09:47,474
Thank you.

942
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:53,188
Why was there not enough evidence?

943
01:09:53,356 --> 01:09:55,941
You had William Santiago's letter.

944
01:09:57,110 --> 01:10:02,614
Santiago was the only eyewitness. I had no chance to interview him.

945
01:10:02,782 --> 01:10:05,784
And now we'll never know, will we, Mr. McGuire?

946
01:10:06,536 --> 01:10:07,995
No.

947
01:10:09,414 --> 01:10:13,584
No more questions. The witness is excused.

948
01:10:16,504 --> 01:10:18,964
Corporal Carl Hammaker, Marine barracks,

949
01:10:19,132 --> 01:10:22,467
Rifle Security Company Windward, 2nd Platoon Bravo.

950
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:29,433
Were you present at a meeting held by Lieutenant Kendrick on September 6th?

951
01:10:29,601 --> 01:10:33,478
Yes, sir. What was the substance of it?

952
01:10:33,646 --> 01:10:36,690
Lieutenant Kendrick told us we had an informer in our group.

953
01:10:36,858 --> 01:10:42,487
That Santiago had reported to the NIS on a member of our platoon.

954
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:44,865
Did that make you mad?

955
01:10:45,033 --> 01:10:48,327
You can tell the truth. Did it? Yes, sir.

956
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:49,661
How mad?

957
01:10:49,829 --> 01:10:53,582
Santiago betrayed a code we believe in very deeply.

958
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:56,376
Were other men also angry? Object. Speculation.

959
01:10:56,628 --> 01:10:58,211
Were Dawson and Downey?

960
01:10:58,463 --> 01:11:00,714
Is the counsel asking this witness to testify

961
01:11:00,882 --> 01:11:03,508
as to how my clients felt on Sept. 6th?

962
01:11:03,927 --> 01:11:05,510
Sustained.

963
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:11,350
Did Lieutenant Kendrick leave a standing order at that meeting?

964
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:13,769
Yes, sir. What was it?

965
01:11:15,897 --> 01:11:19,316
It was clear he didn't want us taking matters into our own hands.

966
01:11:19,484 --> 01:11:26,198
What was the order? Santiago wasn't to be touched.

967
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:30,452
Your witness.

968
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:34,373
Were you in Dawson and Downey's room five minutes later?

969
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:35,874
No, sir.

970
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:40,879
Thanks. No more questions. The witness is excused.

971
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:47,260
Government calls Corporal Raymond Thomas.

972
01:11:47,428 --> 01:11:52,933
Please the court, I understand Captain Ross is planning to call all the members of the platoon to testify.

973
01:11:53,101 --> 01:11:55,477
In light of the defense Kaffee is planning,

974
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:59,314
the platoon leader's instructions seems relevant testimony.

975
01:11:59,482 --> 01:12:04,069
The defense concedes that all 22 will confirm Hammaker's account

976
01:12:04,237 --> 01:12:06,488
if the government concedes none of them

977
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:10,409
were in Dawson and Downey's room at 1620.

978
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:14,913
Captain? The government will stipulate.

979
01:12:15,081 --> 01:12:19,001
Then we will adjourn. You can call your next witness tomorrow.

980
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:20,919
All rise.

981
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:35,308
Let's go over the doctor again. It's the right approach.

982
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:37,352
We've been over this already.

983
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:41,231
At 3:00, Stone says he doesn't know what killed Santiago.

984
01:12:41,399 --> 01:12:46,111
Then he meets with Jessep, and at 5:00 he says it was poison? He's not telling the truth.

985
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:47,362
Oh, that's a relief.

986
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:50,991
I was afraid I couldn't use the liar, liar, pants on fire defense.

987
01:12:51,159 --> 01:12:57,414
We can't prove coercion. Let's go over what we have.

988
01:13:06,049 --> 01:13:09,634
Private Santiago was admitted to the ER at 0012,

989
01:13:09,802 --> 01:13:13,680
and he was pronounced dead at 0037.

990
01:13:13,848 --> 01:13:17,142
Dr. Stone, what is lactic acidosis?

991
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:20,896
If the muscles and other cells burn sugar instead of oxygen,

992
01:13:21,064 --> 01:13:22,564
lactic acid is produced.

993
01:13:22,732 --> 01:13:26,151
That lactic acid is what caused Santiago's lungs to bleed.

994
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:31,656
How long does it take before the muscles start burning sugar?

995
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:38,121
Twenty to 30 minutes. What made it faster with Santiago?

996
01:13:38,289 --> 01:13:43,502
An ingested poison of some kind. Object. The witness is speculating.

997
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:45,378
He is an expert medical witness.

998
01:13:45,546 --> 01:13:48,173
In this court, his opinion is not speculation.

999
01:13:48,341 --> 01:13:53,845
He is not a criminologist. The medical facts are inconclusive.

1000
01:13:54,013 --> 01:13:57,682
A point I'm confident you'll illustrate on your cross-examination.

1001
01:13:57,850 --> 01:14:00,852
So I'm sure you won't mind if his opinion is admitted now?

1002
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:03,522
Not at all, sir.

1003
01:14:05,066 --> 01:14:11,154
Did Willy Santiago die of poisoning? Absolutely.

1004
01:14:11,322 --> 01:14:15,325
You're aware that the lab and coroner's reports show no traces of poison?

1005
01:14:15,493 --> 01:14:17,953
Yes, I am. Then how do you justify…?

1006
01:14:18,121 --> 01:14:21,039
There are literally dozens of toxins which are virtually undetectable,

1007
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:23,583
both in the human body and on the fabric.

1008
01:14:23,751 --> 01:14:27,462
The nature of the acidosis is the compelling factor here.

1009
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:30,173
Thank you, sir.

1010
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:36,888
Commander, is it possible for a person to have an affliction, some condition,

1011
01:14:37,056 --> 01:14:39,891
which might also speed up acidosis?

1012
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:46,481
Is it possible? It's possible.

1013
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:50,110
What might some of those conditions be?

1014
01:14:50,278 --> 01:14:53,405
If a person had a coronary or cerebral disorder,

1015
01:14:53,573 --> 01:14:55,657
the process would be more rapid.

1016
01:14:55,825 --> 01:14:57,909
If I had a coronary condition

1017
01:14:58,077 --> 01:15:01,663
and a perfectly clean rag was placed in my mouth and pushed too far,

1018
01:15:01,831 --> 01:15:04,749
is it possible my cells would continue burning sugar

1019
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:06,418
after the rag was taken out?

1020
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:09,379
It would have to be a very serious condition.

1021
01:15:09,547 --> 01:15:13,800
Is it possible to have a serious condition where initial symptoms were so mild

1022
01:15:13,968 --> 01:15:18,221
as to escape a physician during a routine medical exam?

1023
01:15:18,389 --> 01:15:21,099
Possibly. There would still be symptoms.

1024
01:15:21,267 --> 01:15:22,601
What kind of symptoms?

1025
01:15:23,019 --> 01:15:25,228
There are hundreds of… Chest pains?

1026
01:15:25,396 --> 01:15:28,607
Yes. Yes. Shortness of breath? Fatigue?

1027
01:15:29,066 --> 01:15:30,442
Of course.

1028
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:40,744
Doctor, is this your signature? Yes, it is.

1029
01:15:41,287 --> 01:15:45,123
This is an order for Private Santiago to be put on restricted duty.

1030
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:49,127
Would you read your handwritten remarks at the bottom of the page?

1031
01:15:49,295 --> 01:15:55,634
Patient complains of chest pains, shortness of breath, and fatigue.

1032
01:15:55,801 --> 01:16:00,138
Restricted from running distances over five miles for one week.

1033
01:16:02,308 --> 01:16:05,644
Isn't it possible Santiago had a serious coronary condition

1034
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:10,815
and it was that condition, not poison, that caused the rapid chemical reaction?

1035
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:14,152
No. It's not possible?

1036
01:16:14,654 --> 01:16:19,157
No. I personally give each man a thorough physical examination.

1037
01:16:19,325 --> 01:16:22,327
Private Santiago was given a clean bill of health.

1038
01:16:22,495 --> 01:16:24,829
That's why it had to be poison, right?

1039
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:27,791
Because if you gave a man with a serious condition

1040
01:16:27,959 --> 01:16:31,670
a clean bill of health and he died from a heart-related incident,

1041
01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:33,755
you'd have a lot to answer for.

1042
01:16:33,923 --> 01:16:36,800
- Object! Move to strike! - Sustained.

1043
01:16:38,052 --> 01:16:41,179
I have no more questions, Your Honor.

1044
01:16:41,347 --> 01:16:44,683
You've held a license to practice medicine for 17 years.

1045
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:48,478
You're certified in internal medicine, you're chief of internal medicine

1046
01:16:48,646 --> 01:16:52,691
at a hospital which has served 5426 people.

1047
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:57,654
In your professional opinion, was Willy Santiago poisoned?

1048
01:16:57,822 --> 01:17:02,575
We ask that the doctor's testimony be stricken from the record.

1049
01:17:02,743 --> 01:17:06,663
The court members should lend no weight to this witness's testimony.

1050
01:17:06,831 --> 01:17:08,373
The objection's overruled.

1051
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:13,420
We strenuously object, and requests an 802 conference

1052
01:17:13,587 --> 01:17:16,798
so His Honor can hear discussion before ruling on this objection.

1053
01:17:16,966 --> 01:17:21,636
The objection has been overruled. Move to reconsider.

1054
01:17:21,804 --> 01:17:27,058
Noted. The witness is an expert, and the court will hear his opinion!

1055
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:36,234
In your expert professional opinion,

1056
01:17:36,402 --> 01:17:39,029
was Willy Santiago poisoned?

1057
01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:44,868
Yes. Thank you, sir. No more questions.

1058
01:17:45,119 --> 01:17:47,370
You may step down.

1059
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:57,380
While we reserve the right to call rebuttal witnesses, government rests.

1060
01:17:57,548 --> 01:18:00,050
We'll recess until Monday the 19th,

1061
01:18:00,217 --> 01:18:03,595
when the defense will call its first witness.

1062
01:18:05,139 --> 01:18:07,265
All rise.

1063
01:18:15,816 --> 01:18:21,071
I strenuously object? Is that how it works?

1064
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:25,283
Objection. Overruled! No, I strenuously object!

1065
01:18:25,451 --> 01:18:29,454
Oh, then I'll reconsider! I got it on the record.

1066
01:18:29,622 --> 01:18:32,082
You got the court thinking we're afraid of the doctor.

1067
01:18:32,249 --> 01:18:34,793
You object once, so we can say he's not a criminologist.

1068
01:18:35,002 --> 01:18:38,296
You keep after it, our cross looks like a bunch of fancy lawyer tricks.

1069
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:41,716
It's the difference between paper law and trial law!

1070
01:18:41,967 --> 01:18:45,387
The judge called him an expert! Sam, she made a mistake.

1071
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:47,222
Let's not relive it.

1072
01:18:48,974 --> 01:18:53,436
I'm gonna go call my wife. I'll see you tonight.

1073
01:18:54,814 --> 01:18:59,401
Why do you hate them so much? They beat up on a weakling.

1074
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:02,654
The rest is this just smoke-filled-coffeehouse crap.

1075
01:19:02,822 --> 01:19:05,907
They tortured and tormented a weaker kid!

1076
01:19:06,075 --> 01:19:10,954
They didn't like him, so they killed him. Why? Because he couldn't run very fast!

1077
01:19:11,122 --> 01:19:14,666
Everybody take the night off.

1078
01:19:14,834 --> 01:19:16,668
I'm sorry…

1079
01:19:16,836 --> 01:19:23,007
We've been working 20 hours a day. Go see your wife and daughter.

1080
01:19:23,175 --> 01:19:25,176
Jo, go do…

1081
01:19:26,429 --> 01:19:30,181
Whatever it is you do when you're not here.

1082
01:19:30,433 --> 01:19:32,767
What day is tomorrow? Saturday.

1083
01:19:32,935 --> 01:19:34,936
We'll start at 10.

1084
01:19:38,941 --> 01:19:42,026
Why do you like them so much?

1085
01:19:45,489 --> 01:19:49,617
Because they stand on a wall and say, Nothing's gonna hurt you tonight.

1086
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:51,661
Not on my watch.

1087
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:59,878
Don't worry about the doctor. This trial starts Monday.

1088
01:20:28,782 --> 01:20:32,076
I'm sorry to bother you. I should have called first.

1089
01:20:32,244 --> 01:20:37,624
No, I was just watching the ball game. Come on in.

1090
01:20:51,347 --> 01:20:56,893
I was wondering how you'd feel if I took you to dinner tonight?

1091
01:20:57,061 --> 01:20:59,938
Are you asking me out on a date? No.

1092
01:21:00,105 --> 01:21:02,065
It sounded like you were. I wasn't.

1093
01:21:02,233 --> 01:21:05,109
I've been asked out before, and that's what it sounded like.

1094
01:21:06,237 --> 01:21:09,280
Do you like seafood? I know a good seafood place.

1095
01:21:09,448 --> 01:21:10,949
Okay.

1096
01:21:17,456 --> 01:21:20,625
My third case was a drunk and disorderly. It lasted nine weeks.

1097
01:21:20,793 --> 01:21:23,461
I rounded up 31 people from the bar that night.

1098
01:21:23,629 --> 01:21:26,965
Nine weeks on a D and D? What was the prosecutor offering?

1099
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:29,592
Fifteen days.

1100
01:21:31,428 --> 01:21:33,429
You sure hustled the shit out of him.

1101
01:21:33,597 --> 01:21:35,723
After that, they moved me to Internal Affairs.

1102
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:36,891
Tough to blame them.

1103
01:21:37,059 --> 01:21:41,729
Where I have earned two medals and two letters of commendation.

1104
01:21:42,147 --> 01:21:44,816
Why are you always giving me your résumé?

1105
01:21:48,821 --> 01:21:52,740
I want you to think I'm a good lawyer. I do.

1106
01:21:52,992 --> 01:21:54,993
No, you don't.

1107
01:21:58,539 --> 01:22:00,665
I think you're an exceptional lawyer.

1108
01:22:01,417 --> 01:22:06,129
I watch the court members. They respond to you. They like you.

1109
01:22:06,297 --> 01:22:11,509
I see you convincing them. Dawson and Downey are gonna end up owing their lives to you.

1110
01:22:15,222 --> 01:22:17,890
Jo, I think…

1111
01:22:18,809 --> 01:22:22,478
I think you should prepare yourself for the fact that we're gonna lose.

1112
01:22:22,688 --> 01:22:26,024
Ross's opening statement, it was all true.

1113
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:30,945
Let's pretend it would matter to the court that the guys were given an order.

1114
01:22:31,113 --> 01:22:33,615
I can't prove it ever happened.

1115
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:36,284
We'll keep doing what we're doing and put on a show,

1116
01:22:36,452 --> 01:22:41,664
but all we have is the testimony of two people accused of murder.

1117
01:22:42,916 --> 01:22:49,339
We'll find Markinson. Jo, we're gonna lose, and lose huge.

1118
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:57,889
Corporal Barnes, Windward Barracks, Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.

1119
01:22:58,057 --> 01:23:02,352
Name some reasons why a Marine would receive a Code Red.

1120
01:23:02,519 --> 01:23:05,688
Being late for platoon or company meetings,

1121
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:09,817
keeping barracks in disorder, falling back on a run…

1122
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:12,362
Have you ever received a Code Red? Yes, sir.

1123
01:23:12,529 --> 01:23:15,990
We were doing seven-man assault drills, and my weapon slipped.

1124
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:23,081
It was over 100 degrees. My palms were sweaty and I hadn't used resin like we were taught.

1125
01:23:23,248 --> 01:23:28,002
What happened? The guys threw a blanket over me.

1126
01:23:28,170 --> 01:23:33,466
They punched me on the arms and poured glue on my hands.

1127
01:23:33,634 --> 01:23:37,261
And it worked. I ain't never dropped my weapon since.

1128
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:42,517
Was Private Santiago ever late? Yes, sir.

1129
01:23:42,685 --> 01:23:45,395
Was his barracks ever in disorder? Yes, sir.

1130
01:23:45,562 --> 01:23:47,980
Did he ever fall back on a run? All the time, sir.

1131
01:23:48,148 --> 01:23:53,277
Did he ever, prior to September 6th, receive a Code Red?

1132
01:23:53,445 --> 01:23:54,737
No, sir.

1133
01:23:54,947 --> 01:23:56,864
Never? No, sir.

1134
01:23:58,492 --> 01:24:00,952
You got a Code Red because your palms were sweaty.

1135
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:04,789
Why didn't Santiago, this burden to his unit, ever get one?

1136
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:11,713
Dawson wouldn't allow it, sir. Dawson wouldn't allow it.

1137
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:17,468
The guys talked tough about Santiago, but they were too afraid of Dawson.

1138
01:24:17,636 --> 01:24:19,971
Object. Witness is speculating.

1139
01:24:20,139 --> 01:24:23,307
I'll rephrase. Did you want to give Santiago a Code Red?

1140
01:24:23,475 --> 01:24:24,559
Yes, sir.

1141
01:24:24,727 --> 01:24:28,646
Why didn't you? Because Dawson would kick my butt.

1142
01:24:28,814 --> 01:24:34,110
Good enough. Captain Ross is gonna ask you some questions.

1143
01:24:34,278 --> 01:24:39,615
Corporal Barnes, I hold here the Marine Outline for Recruit Training.

1144
01:24:39,783 --> 01:24:41,325
Are you familiar with this book? Yes, sir.

1145
01:24:41,493 --> 01:24:43,494
Have you read it? Good. Yes, sir.

1146
01:24:43,662 --> 01:24:47,832
Turn to the chapter that deals with Code Reds, please.

1147
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:49,333
Sir?

1148
01:24:49,501 --> 01:24:53,004
Just flip to the page that discusses Code Reds.

1149
01:24:55,090 --> 01:25:00,511
Well, Code Red is a term that we use down at Gitmo. I don't know if it's…

1150
01:25:00,679 --> 01:25:02,930
Oh, we're in luck, then.

1151
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:08,770
Standard Operating Procedure, Rifle Security Company,

1152
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:10,605
Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.

1153
01:25:10,773 --> 01:25:14,484
I assume we'll find Code Red in there?

1154
01:25:14,651 --> 01:25:16,444
No, sir. No?

1155
01:25:16,612 --> 01:25:22,617
I'm a Marine. Is there no book, no set of orders or regulations,

1156
01:25:22,785 --> 01:25:27,121
telling me that one of my duties is to perform Code Reds?

1157
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:30,625
No, sir. No book, sir.

1158
01:25:30,793 --> 01:25:33,461
No further questions.

1159
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:39,717
Would you turn to the page that says where the mess hall is, please?

1160
01:25:39,885 --> 01:25:42,887
Lieutenant Kaffee, that's not in the book, sir.

1161
01:25:44,556 --> 01:25:50,603
You mean you've never had a meal? No, sir. Three squares a day, sir.

1162
01:25:51,396 --> 01:25:56,150
I don't understand. How did you find the mess hall if it's not in this book?

1163
01:25:58,779 --> 01:26:01,864
I guess I just followed the crowd at chow time, sir.

1164
01:26:02,741 --> 01:26:05,076
No more questions.

1165
01:26:05,244 --> 01:26:07,578
Corporal Barnes, you may step down.

1166
01:26:07,746 --> 01:26:08,830
Thank you, sir.

1167
01:26:14,503 --> 01:26:17,129
Seven tonight, we'll do a final Kendrick review.

1168
01:26:17,297 --> 01:26:19,882
I wanna slam-dunk this guy.

1169
01:26:31,270 --> 01:26:32,562
Hey, Luther.

1170
01:26:32,729 --> 01:26:35,731
Admiral! How's the big case going?

1171
01:26:35,899 --> 01:26:38,484
Nose to the grindstone. No flies on you.

1172
01:26:38,735 --> 01:26:40,570
Rolling stone gathers no moss.

1173
01:26:40,821 --> 01:26:43,489
Well, it ain't over till the fat lady sings.

1174
01:26:43,657 --> 01:26:45,616
You can say that again.

1175
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:49,954
It ain't over till the fat lady sings. Till the fat lady sings.

1176
01:26:50,122 --> 01:26:52,290
I walked into that one.

1177
01:27:03,886 --> 01:27:09,307
Jesus Christ! You left the door unlocked.

1178
01:27:09,474 --> 01:27:12,268
You scared the shit out of me. Just keep driving.

1179
01:27:12,519 --> 01:27:14,312
Are you aware you're under subpoena?

1180
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:18,190
Yes. I'm also aware the lives of two Marines are in your hands.

1181
01:27:18,358 --> 01:27:20,484
If I could do something about that, I would.

1182
01:27:20,652 --> 01:27:22,778
Since I can't, all I can do is help you.

1183
01:27:22,946 --> 01:27:25,239
What do you know? I know everything.

1184
01:27:25,449 --> 01:27:27,742
Was it a Code Red? Yes.

1185
01:27:27,993 --> 01:27:29,994
Did Kendrick give the order? Yes.

1186
01:27:30,162 --> 01:27:32,079
Did you witness it? Did you witness it?

1187
01:27:32,247 --> 01:27:33,664
No. Then how do you know?

1188
01:27:33,832 --> 01:27:35,499
I know. Yeah, you know shit.

1189
01:27:35,667 --> 01:27:37,960
He was never gonna be transferred off that base.

1190
01:27:43,926 --> 01:27:47,178
Jessep was gonna keep him on the base, said he wanted him trained.

1191
01:27:47,346 --> 01:27:49,847
You signed the transfer order. Yeah, I know.

1192
01:27:50,015 --> 01:27:53,935
I signed them when you got to Cuba, five days after Santiago's death.

1193
01:27:57,648 --> 01:27:59,941
I'll get you immunity with the prosecutor.

1194
01:28:00,108 --> 01:28:04,570
In about four days you're gonna tell the court what you told me.

1195
01:28:04,738 --> 01:28:08,950
Right now I'll check you into a motel. We're gonna start from the beginning.

1196
01:28:09,117 --> 01:28:12,870
I don't want a deal, and I don't want immunity.

1197
01:28:13,038 --> 01:28:19,293
I'm not proud of what I have done, nor of what I am doing.

1198
01:28:20,587 --> 01:28:22,463
- Where is he? - The Downtown Lodge.

1199
01:28:22,631 --> 01:28:24,715
I want him guarded. That's a good idea.

1200
01:28:24,883 --> 01:28:27,385
My clearance code is 4115273. Clearance code?

1201
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:29,637
I don't have a clearance code. You?

1202
01:28:29,805 --> 01:28:30,930
Danny. It's Jo Galloway.

1203
01:28:31,098 --> 01:28:32,139
I need to secure a witness.

1204
01:28:32,307 --> 01:28:35,476
He also said Jessep's lying about transportation off the base.

1205
01:28:35,644 --> 01:28:38,479
Jessep said that 6 the next morning was the first flight Santiago could have left on.

1206
01:28:38,647 --> 01:28:41,899
Markinson says there was one that left seven hours earlier.

1207
01:28:42,067 --> 01:28:44,026
That was impressive. Did you hear that?

1208
01:28:44,194 --> 01:28:47,738
Yeah. Sam, isn't there a record of flights?

1209
01:28:47,906 --> 01:28:50,574
You need the tower chief's log from Gitmo.

1210
01:28:50,742 --> 01:28:52,368
Get it. We're gonna win.

1211
01:28:52,536 --> 01:28:55,997
Jo, don't get crazy. We don't know Markinson, or the log book.

1212
01:28:56,164 --> 01:28:59,333
You concentrate on Downey, I'll talk to Ross.

1213
01:29:04,381 --> 01:29:09,635
Hey, Danny. Nice work today. The redirect on Barnes.

1214
01:29:09,803 --> 01:29:14,056
I have Markinson. Where is he?

1215
01:29:14,224 --> 01:29:18,436
Motel room in Northeast, six marshals outside the door. Take a sip.

1216
01:29:18,603 --> 01:29:20,896
The transfer Markinson signed is phony.

1217
01:29:21,064 --> 01:29:24,191
And Jessep lied about the first flight. We're getting the log.

1218
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:25,401
Can I get you something?

1219
01:29:25,569 --> 01:29:26,777
Beer, please.

1220
01:29:26,945 --> 01:29:30,614
In the meantime, I'm gonna put Kendrick on the stand and have some fun.

1221
01:29:30,782 --> 01:29:33,284
All right. I have an obligation to tell you.

1222
01:29:33,452 --> 01:29:36,662
If you accuse Kendrick or Jessep of any crime without evidence,

1223
01:29:36,830 --> 01:29:39,457
you'll be court-martialed for misconduct

1224
01:29:39,624 --> 01:29:44,045
and that's gonna be stapled to every job application you ever fill out.

1225
01:29:45,839 --> 01:29:49,633
Markinson won't hold up, he's a crazy man.

1226
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:52,970
I'm not saying this to intimidate you, I'm being your lawyer here.

1227
01:29:53,138 --> 01:29:56,974
Thanks. And I wanna tell you I think the whole fucking bunch of you are insane.

1228
01:29:57,142 --> 01:29:59,560
This code of honor makes me wanna beat the shit out of something!

1229
01:29:59,728 --> 01:30:03,481
Don't you dare lump me in with Jessep and Kendrick.

1230
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:08,611
I'm your friend. Your clients don't belong in jail, but it's not my decision.

1231
01:30:08,779 --> 01:30:13,157
I represent the U.S. government without passion or prejudice,

1232
01:30:13,325 --> 01:30:16,243
- and my client has a case. - Here you go.

1233
01:30:20,290 --> 01:30:23,542
I want you to acknowledge that the judge advocate has made you aware

1234
01:30:23,710 --> 01:30:28,255
of the consequences of accusing a Marine officer without evidence.

1235
01:30:29,091 --> 01:30:30,966
I've been so advised.

1236
01:30:35,222 --> 01:30:42,103
You got bullied into that courtroom. By everyone. By Dawson. By Galloway.

1237
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:44,522
Shit, I practically dared you.

1238
01:30:45,941 --> 01:30:49,276
You got bullied into that courtroom by the memory of a dead lawyer.

1239
01:30:55,450 --> 01:31:00,454
You're a lousy fucking softball player, Jack!

1240
01:31:01,957 --> 01:31:04,291
Your boys are going down, Danny.

1241
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:07,503
I can't stop it anymore.

1242
01:31:11,466 --> 01:31:14,677
Was Santiago a good Marine?

1243
01:31:14,845 --> 01:31:16,846
I'd say he was average.

1244
01:31:17,013 --> 01:31:23,936
Your proficiency and conduct reports all indicate he was below average.

1245
01:31:27,524 --> 01:31:31,277
Yes, he was below average.

1246
01:31:31,444 --> 01:31:34,238
I did not see the need to trample on his grave.

1247
01:31:35,407 --> 01:31:40,161
We appreciate it, but you're under oath. I think we'd all like to hear the truth.

1248
01:31:40,328 --> 01:31:42,079
I'm aware of my oath.

1249
01:31:42,247 --> 01:31:47,293
These are the last three pro-con reports you signed for Lance Corporal Dawson.

1250
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:53,549
He rated exceptional twice, but on June 9th he's below average.

1251
01:31:53,717 --> 01:31:57,595
I'd like to discuss that. That would be fine.

1252
01:31:57,762 --> 01:32:01,348
Dawson's ranking after the School of Infantry was perfect.

1253
01:32:01,516 --> 01:32:06,729
But unlike most of his class, he hasn't been promoted.

1254
01:32:06,897 --> 01:32:11,775
Was this report the reason? I'm sure it was.

1255
01:32:11,943 --> 01:32:16,238
Do you recall why he got this grade? I'm sure I don't.

1256
01:32:16,406 --> 01:32:20,117
I have many men in my charge. I write many reports.

1257
01:32:20,285 --> 01:32:25,956
Do you recall an incident involving a PFC Curtis Bell

1258
01:32:26,124 --> 01:32:28,751
stealing liquor from the officers' club?

1259
01:32:29,044 --> 01:32:30,753
Yes, I do.

1260
01:32:30,921 --> 01:32:33,255
Did you report Private Bell to the proper authorities?

1261
01:32:35,217 --> 01:32:37,259
I have two books at my bedside:

1262
01:32:37,427 --> 01:32:40,221
The Marine Corps Code of Conduct and the King James Bible.

1263
01:32:40,388 --> 01:32:45,851
The only proper authorities I'm aware of are Colonel Jessep and God.

1264
01:32:47,395 --> 01:32:52,733
Then you don't acknowledge this court as a proper authority?

1265
01:32:52,901 --> 01:32:57,780
Objection. Argumentative. Sustained. Watch yourself.

1266
01:32:57,948 --> 01:33:03,744
Did you report Private Bell? I thought very highly of him.

1267
01:33:03,912 --> 01:33:06,664
I didn't want his record tarnished by a charge.

1268
01:33:07,749 --> 01:33:10,668
You preferred it be handled within the unit?

1269
01:33:12,462 --> 01:33:14,338
Yes, I most certainly did.

1270
01:33:15,382 --> 01:33:18,801
Do you know what a Code Red is? Yes, I do.

1271
01:33:18,969 --> 01:33:22,096
Have you ever ordered one? No, I have not.

1272
01:33:22,264 --> 01:33:26,725
Did you order that Private Bell receive no food or drink

1273
01:33:26,893 --> 01:33:30,771
except water for a period of seven days?

1274
01:33:30,939 --> 01:33:35,526
You're distorting the truth. He was on barracks restriction.

1275
01:33:35,694 --> 01:33:42,658
He was given water and vitamins. His health was never in danger.

1276
01:33:42,867 --> 01:33:48,205
I'm sure it was lovely for him. But you did order the restriction.

1277
01:33:48,373 --> 01:33:52,459
You denied him food? Yes, I did.

1278
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:59,049
Wouldn't this be called a Code Red? No.

1279
01:33:59,217 --> 01:34:04,555
Would the other 478 Marines at Guantánamo Bay consider it a Code Red?

1280
01:34:04,723 --> 01:34:09,184
The witness can't testify as to what 478 other men would say.

1281
01:34:09,352 --> 01:34:13,147
We object to this line of questioning as argumentative

1282
01:34:13,315 --> 01:34:15,566
and irrelevant badgering of the witness.

1283
01:34:15,734 --> 01:34:19,403
Sustained. And I would remind you

1284
01:34:19,571 --> 01:34:23,574
that you're questioning an officer with an impeccable service record.

1285
01:34:23,742 --> 01:34:25,326
Thank you, Your Honor.

1286
01:34:26,202 --> 01:34:32,916
Was Dawson rated below average for sneaking food to Private Bell?

1287
01:34:33,084 --> 01:34:36,420
Object! Not so fast. Lieutenant?

1288
01:34:38,089 --> 01:34:41,759
Dawson was given a below average rating

1289
01:34:42,552 --> 01:34:45,220
because he had committed a crime.

1290
01:34:45,388 --> 01:34:49,558
Crime? What crime did he commit?

1291
01:34:50,352 --> 01:34:56,523
Lieutenant Kendrick, Dawson brought a hungry guy some food.

1292
01:34:56,691 --> 01:35:01,779
What crime did he commit? He disobeyed an order.

1293
01:35:01,946 --> 01:35:07,493
And because he made a decision about the welfare of a Marine

1294
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:11,121
that conflicted with your order, he was punished, right?

1295
01:35:11,289 --> 01:35:14,750
Lance Corporal Dawson disobeyed an order!

1296
01:35:14,918 --> 01:35:19,671
It wasn't a real order, was it? After all, it's peacetime.

1297
01:35:19,839 --> 01:35:22,966
He wasn't asked to advance on a beachhead.

1298
01:35:23,134 --> 01:35:27,471
Surely a Marine of Dawson's intelligence

1299
01:35:27,639 --> 01:35:30,474
can be trusted to determine which are the important orders

1300
01:35:30,642 --> 01:35:34,603
and which orders might, say, be morally questionable?

1301
01:35:35,980 --> 01:35:39,775
Lieutenant Kendrick? Can he?

1302
01:35:39,943 --> 01:35:43,404
Can Dawson determine on his own which orders to follow?

1303
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:45,155
No, he cannot.

1304
01:35:45,323 --> 01:35:47,950
A lesson he learned after the Bell incident.

1305
01:35:48,118 --> 01:35:50,452
I would think so. You know so, don't you?

1306
01:35:50,662 --> 01:35:52,663
- Object! - Sustained.

1307
01:35:55,166 --> 01:35:57,876
Lieutenant Kendrick, one final question.

1308
01:35:58,878 --> 01:36:02,256
If you had ordered Dawson to give Santiago a Code Red,

1309
01:36:02,424 --> 01:36:04,716
I ordered them not to touch him!

1310
01:36:04,884 --> 01:36:06,510
Would he have disobeyed you again?

1311
01:36:06,678 --> 01:36:10,681
Lieutenant, don't answer that! You don't have to. I'm through.

1312
01:36:11,141 --> 01:36:18,856
Did you order Dawson and Downey to give Willy Santiago a Code Red?

1313
01:36:20,275 --> 01:36:22,734
Lieutenant Kendrick, did you…? No, I did not.

1314
01:36:22,902 --> 01:36:24,570
Thank you.

1315
01:36:28,533 --> 01:36:29,700
What's the word?

1316
01:36:29,868 --> 01:36:35,038
Well, I got the tower chief's log. Jessep's telling the truth.

1317
01:36:35,206 --> 01:36:38,375
Six a. M. Flight was the first plane. Let me see this.

1318
01:36:49,512 --> 01:36:53,056
Working late tonight, lieutenant? Oh, yeah.

1319
01:36:56,978 --> 01:37:00,606
There was no flight at 11:00! What the fuck are you trying to pull?!

1320
01:37:00,773 --> 01:37:07,779
The first flight left at 2300. It arrived at Andrews at 2 a. m.

1321
01:37:07,947 --> 01:37:11,074
Really? Then why isn't it listed in the tower chief's log?

1322
01:37:13,077 --> 01:37:18,916
Jessep. What? He fixed the logbook?

1323
01:37:19,083 --> 01:37:22,669
Maybe he can make it so it didn't take off, but I can prove it landed.

1324
01:37:22,837 --> 01:37:25,297
I'll get the logbook from Andrews.

1325
01:37:25,465 --> 01:37:30,260
You won't find anything. He can make a flight disappear?

1326
01:37:30,887 --> 01:37:34,932
Nathan Jessep is about to be appointed to the National Security Council.

1327
01:37:35,099 --> 01:37:38,894
You don't get there without knowing how to sidestep a few landmines.

1328
01:37:39,062 --> 01:37:41,813
He won't be able to sidestep you.

1329
01:37:41,981 --> 01:37:44,274
You still intend to put me on the stand?

1330
01:37:44,442 --> 01:37:47,277
Thursday morning. Ten o'clock.

1331
01:37:51,866 --> 01:37:55,619
There's gotta be someone who can testify to the flight. A ground crew member.

1332
01:37:55,787 --> 01:38:01,917
This isn't TWA. You know how many planes take off and land every day?

1333
01:38:02,085 --> 01:38:04,920
The ground crew isn't gonna remember it.

1334
01:38:05,088 --> 01:38:06,255
Well, how do you know…?

1335
01:38:06,506 --> 01:38:08,674
Forget the flight. Forget the flight.

1336
01:38:08,925 --> 01:38:13,679
Markinson will testify that the transfer was forged.

1337
01:38:13,846 --> 01:38:17,599
That and Downey's testimony really ought to be enough.

1338
01:38:23,356 --> 01:38:27,317
Why did you go into Santiago's room on the night of the 6th?

1339
01:38:27,485 --> 01:38:32,656
To give him a Code Red. And why did you do that?

1340
01:38:33,241 --> 01:38:37,828
I was ordered to by the platoon commander,

1341
01:38:37,996 --> 01:38:40,455
Lieutenant Jonathan James Kendrick.

1342
01:38:41,624 --> 01:38:43,667
You're gonna do fine.

1343
01:38:45,837 --> 01:38:48,171
Think we can rejoin the platoon soon?

1344
01:38:49,507 --> 01:38:51,508
Absolutely.

1345
01:38:54,804 --> 01:38:56,763
Remember the order of the questions? Are you sure?

1346
01:38:56,931 --> 01:38:58,181
Yes. And you'll use small words?

1347
01:38:58,349 --> 01:38:59,474
Yes. He gets rattled when…

1348
01:38:59,642 --> 01:39:01,351
Jo. Just go slow.

1349
01:39:01,519 --> 01:39:02,894
I'm gonna go slow. Okay.

1350
01:39:03,062 --> 01:39:04,521
And get him off as fast as you can.

1351
01:39:04,689 --> 01:39:05,981
JoAnne!

1352
01:39:06,149 --> 01:39:08,775
What? It's gonna be fine.

1353
01:39:11,571 --> 01:39:13,488
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Santiago,

1354
01:39:15,074 --> 01:39:17,367
L was William's executive officer.

1355
01:39:17,535 --> 01:39:19,911
L knew your son vaguely, which is to say I knew his name.

1356
01:39:21,873 --> 01:39:26,793
Soon, the trial of the two men charged with his death will be concluded,

1357
01:39:26,961 --> 01:39:33,342
and the jury will try to offer you an explanation as to why he's dead.

1358
01:39:33,509 --> 01:39:37,346
For my part, I've done as much as I can to bring the truth to light.

1359
01:39:37,513 --> 01:39:39,222
And the truth is this:

1360
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:41,892
Your son is dead for only one reason:

1361
01:39:42,268 --> 01:39:44,895
I wasn't strong enough to stop it.

1362
01:39:45,063 --> 01:39:49,024
Always, Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Andrew Markinson,

1363
01:39:49,192 --> 01:39:50,901
United States Marine Corps.

1364
01:39:56,199 --> 01:39:59,826
Private, I want you to tell us one last time:

1365
01:39:59,994 --> 01:40:05,916
Why did you go to Santiago's room on the night of September 6th?

1366
01:40:06,084 --> 01:40:10,379
A Code Red was ordered by Platoon Commander Kendrick.

1367
01:40:10,546 --> 01:40:14,424
Thank you. Your witness.

1368
01:40:18,930 --> 01:40:22,015
The week of 2 September, the switch log

1369
01:40:22,183 --> 01:40:25,936
has you down at Post 39 until 1600. Right?

1370
01:40:26,104 --> 01:40:32,609
They keep that log pretty good. How far is Post 39 from barracks?

1371
01:40:32,777 --> 01:40:38,990
It's a ways, sir. It's a hike. About how far by jeep?

1372
01:40:40,284 --> 01:40:42,536
About 10, 15 minutes, sir.

1373
01:40:42,704 --> 01:40:46,623
You ever had to walk it? Yes, sir, that day. Friday.

1374
01:40:46,791 --> 01:40:51,712
The pickup private… That's what we call the guy that drops us off.

1375
01:40:51,879 --> 01:40:54,506
Also because he can get girls in New York City.

1376
01:40:56,008 --> 01:40:57,968
…He got a flat right at 39.

1377
01:40:58,136 --> 01:41:03,056
He pulled up and bam, blow-out with no spare. So we had to jog back to barracks.

1378
01:41:03,224 --> 01:41:09,938
And if it's 10 or 15 minutes by jeep, it must be an hour by foot, right?

1379
01:41:10,106 --> 01:41:13,900
We did it in 45 flat, sir. Not bad.

1380
01:41:16,195 --> 01:41:22,617
You've said your assault on Santiago was ordered by Lieutenant Kendrick

1381
01:41:22,785 --> 01:41:27,622
in your barracks room at 1620, am I right?

1382
01:41:27,790 --> 01:41:29,082
Yes, sir.

1383
01:41:29,250 --> 01:41:34,171
You said you weren't back until 1645.

1384
01:41:34,338 --> 01:41:35,589
Sir?

1385
01:41:35,757 --> 01:41:42,012
If you weren't back until 1645, how could you be in your room at 1620?

1386
01:41:42,764 --> 01:41:45,849
Well, you see, sir, there was a blow-out…

1387
01:41:46,017 --> 01:41:49,853
Did you ever actually hear Lieutenant Kendrick order a Code Red?

1388
01:41:50,021 --> 01:41:52,189
Well, Hal said that…

1389
01:41:52,356 --> 01:41:57,027
Did you ever actually hear Lieutenant Kendrick order a Code Red?

1390
01:41:58,070 --> 01:42:02,157
No, sir. I'd like to request a recess.

1391
01:42:02,325 --> 01:42:03,617
Why did you go into Santiago's room?

1392
01:42:03,785 --> 01:42:06,369
The witness has rights! He has been read his rights.

1393
01:42:06,537 --> 01:42:07,954
The question will be repeated.

1394
01:42:08,122 --> 01:42:09,414
Why did you go to Santiago's room?

1395
01:42:09,582 --> 01:42:12,584
- Hal? - Did Dawson tell you to?

1396
01:42:12,752 --> 01:42:14,461
Hal? Don't look at him!

1397
01:42:14,629 --> 01:42:17,214
Hal? Answer the captain's question.

1398
01:42:20,551 --> 01:42:25,722
Yes. I was given an order by Lance Corporal Dawson

1399
01:42:25,890 --> 01:42:27,641
and I followed it.

1400
01:42:49,247 --> 01:42:52,123
Where do you think he is?

1401
01:42:52,917 --> 01:42:56,127
As far as Downey was concerned, it was an order from Kendrick.

1402
01:42:56,295 --> 01:42:59,631
It doesn't matter that he didn't hear firsthand.

1403
01:43:05,137 --> 01:43:07,389
Danny, I'm sorry.

1404
01:43:08,099 --> 01:43:09,891
Don't worry about it.

1405
01:43:10,059 --> 01:43:15,188
All we need to do is call some witnesses to talk about implied orders,

1406
01:43:15,356 --> 01:43:18,108
or call Downey back before we get to Dawson.

1407
01:43:18,776 --> 01:43:23,613
Maybe we could get Dawson charged with the Kennedy assassination?

1408
01:43:26,784 --> 01:43:33,290
Are you drunk? Pretty much. Yeah.

1409
01:43:34,166 --> 01:43:37,627
I'll put on a pot of coffee. We've got a long night's work ahead.

1410
01:43:38,796 --> 01:43:44,259
She's gonna make coffee? That's nice.

1411
01:43:48,180 --> 01:43:54,394
Downey wasn't in his room. He wasn't even there.

1412
01:43:54,562 --> 01:43:59,357
That was important information, don't you think?

1413
01:44:00,109 --> 01:44:04,696
Danny, it was a setback. And I'm sorry.

1414
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:08,950
But we fix it and move on to Markinson.

1415
01:44:09,118 --> 01:44:10,619
Markinson's dead.

1416
01:44:16,542 --> 01:44:20,879
You really got to hand it to those federal marshals, boy.

1417
01:44:21,047 --> 01:44:27,177
He didn't hang himself by his shoelaces, or slash his wrists with a butter knife.

1418
01:44:29,388 --> 01:44:36,144
This guy got into full dress uniform, drew a nickel-plated pistol,

1419
01:44:36,312 --> 01:44:38,813
and fired a bullet into his mouth.

1420
01:44:42,693 --> 01:44:47,322
Anyway, since we're out of witnesses, I thought I'd drink a little.

1421
01:44:47,490 --> 01:44:52,535
I still think we can win. Maybe you should drink a little.

1422
01:44:52,787 --> 01:44:57,624
In the morning, we'll ask Randolph for a continuance, 24 hours.

1423
01:44:57,792 --> 01:45:00,961
Why would we do that? To subpoena Colonel Jessep.

1424
01:45:02,046 --> 01:45:03,755
What? Listen for a second.

1425
01:45:03,923 --> 01:45:06,675
Just hear me out. No! I won't listen.

1426
01:45:06,842 --> 01:45:09,427
Your passion is compelling, but useless.

1427
01:45:09,595 --> 01:45:13,515
Louden Downey needed a trial lawyer today.

1428
01:45:15,810 --> 01:45:20,105
You chickenshit. You just want an excuse to give up.

1429
01:45:21,273 --> 01:45:23,149
It's over.

1430
01:45:23,317 --> 01:45:25,652
Why did you ask Jessep for the transfer order?

1431
01:45:25,820 --> 01:45:28,446
In Cuba, why did you ask him? What does it matter?

1432
01:45:28,614 --> 01:45:31,199
I wanted the damn transfer order! Bullshit!

1433
01:45:31,367 --> 01:45:34,744
You could have gotten it by calling any one of a dozen departments.

1434
01:45:34,912 --> 01:45:39,582
You didn't want the order. You wanted to see Jessep's reaction.

1435
01:45:39,750 --> 01:45:42,711
You had an instinct and it was confirmed by Markinson.

1436
01:45:42,878 --> 01:45:45,714
Now let's put Jessep on the stand and end this thing.

1437
01:45:45,881 --> 01:45:52,178
What possible good would that do? He ordered the Code Red.

1438
01:45:52,346 --> 01:45:58,643
He did? That's great! And of course, you have proof?

1439
01:45:58,811 --> 01:46:02,939
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot. You were sick that day at law school.

1440
01:46:03,107 --> 01:46:05,442
You put him on the stand and get it from him.

1441
01:46:05,609 --> 01:46:09,821
We get it from him! Yes, no problem. We get it from him.

1442
01:46:09,989 --> 01:46:14,200
Colonel Jessep, isn't it true you ordered the Code Red on Santiago?

1443
01:46:15,536 --> 01:46:18,455
I'm sorry, time's run out! What do we have for the losers, judge?

1444
01:46:18,622 --> 01:46:22,834
Well, for our defendants, it's a lifetime at exotic Fort Leavenworth!

1445
01:46:23,002 --> 01:46:28,757
And for Defense Counsel Kaffee, that's right, it's a court-martial!

1446
01:46:28,924 --> 01:46:34,345
After falsely accusing a decorated officer of conspiracy and perjury,

1447
01:46:34,513 --> 01:46:38,016
Lieutenant Kaffee will have a long and prosperous career

1448
01:46:38,184 --> 01:46:43,271
teaching typewriter maintenance at a women's school!

1449
01:46:43,439 --> 01:46:49,652
Thank you for playing Follow the Advice of the Galactically Stupid!

1450
01:47:11,467 --> 01:47:14,636
I'm sorry I lost you your set of steak knives.

1451
01:47:31,612 --> 01:47:35,281
Stop cleaning up.

1452
01:47:37,201 --> 01:47:41,412
Sam, stop cleaning up.

1453
01:47:49,004 --> 01:47:54,008
You want a drink? Yeah.

1454
01:48:10,067 --> 01:48:13,111
Is your father proud of you? Don't do this to yourself.

1455
01:48:13,279 --> 01:48:15,029
I'll bet he is.

1456
01:48:15,906 --> 01:48:19,117
I'll bet he bores the shit out of the neighbors and relatives.

1457
01:48:19,285 --> 01:48:21,703
Sam's made law review.

1458
01:48:21,871 --> 01:48:27,959
He's got a big case he's making. He's making an argument.

1459
01:48:32,381 --> 01:48:38,261
I think my father would have enjoyed seeing me graduate from law school.

1460
01:48:40,222 --> 01:48:44,309
I think he would have liked that a lot.

1461
01:48:45,394 --> 01:48:48,396
I ever tell you I wrote a paper about your father in college?

1462
01:48:49,398 --> 01:48:50,899
Yeah?

1463
01:48:51,567 --> 01:48:56,946
One of the best trial lawyers ever. Yes, he was.

1464
01:48:57,198 --> 01:49:02,243
But if I were Dawson and Downey, and had to choose you or him,

1465
01:49:02,411 --> 01:49:05,455
I'd choose you any day of the week, and twice on Sunday.

1466
01:49:06,123 --> 01:49:09,626
You should have seen yourself thunder away at Kendrick.

1467
01:49:12,087 --> 01:49:16,799
Would you put Jessep on the stand? No.

1468
01:49:17,426 --> 01:49:22,347
Do you think my father would have? With the evidence we got?

1469
01:49:22,514 --> 01:49:25,308
Not in a million years.

1470
01:49:25,476 --> 01:49:29,020
But here's the thing, and we can't get around this:

1471
01:49:29,188 --> 01:49:31,105
Neither Lionel Kaffee nor Sam Weinberg

1472
01:49:31,273 --> 01:49:36,361
are lead counsel for the defense in U.S. v. Dawson and Downey.

1473
01:49:36,528 --> 01:49:40,990
So there's really only one question: What would you do?

1474
01:49:49,375 --> 01:49:53,753
Jo. JoAnne! Jo, get in the car.

1475
01:49:53,921 --> 01:49:57,298
JoAnne, please get in the car! Look…

1476
01:49:58,759 --> 01:50:02,929
JoAnne! I apologize. I was angry.

1477
01:50:03,097 --> 01:50:05,682
I'm sorry about what I said.

1478
01:50:05,849 --> 01:50:09,936
I'm gonna put Jessep on the stand!

1479
01:50:28,372 --> 01:50:30,206
What do you suggest we do?

1480
01:50:30,374 --> 01:50:32,917
Hit Jessep with the phony transfer order.

1481
01:50:33,085 --> 01:50:35,378
Without a witness? We have a witness.

1482
01:50:35,546 --> 01:50:36,546
A dead witness.

1483
01:50:36,714 --> 01:50:39,340
To a lesser attorney, that'd be a problem.

1484
01:50:39,508 --> 01:50:44,387
Look. Last night he's swimming in Jack Daniel's, now he can leap tall buildings in a single bound.

1485
01:50:44,555 --> 01:50:49,600
I'm getting my second wind. Sit down, both of you. Good.

1486
01:50:49,768 --> 01:50:51,728
Jessep told Kendrick to order the Code Red,

1487
01:50:51,895 --> 01:50:53,938
Kendrick did, our clients followed orders.

1488
01:50:54,106 --> 01:50:59,360
The cover-up isn't our case. To win, Jessep has to say he gave the order.

1489
01:50:59,945 --> 01:51:03,156
And you can get him to say it? I think he wants to say it!

1490
01:51:03,324 --> 01:51:06,451
I think he's pissed off he's gotta hide. I think he wants to say

1491
01:51:06,618 --> 01:51:09,746
he made a decision, and that's the end of it!

1492
01:51:09,913 --> 01:51:12,040
He eats breakfast 300 yards away

1493
01:51:12,207 --> 01:51:15,501
from 4000 Cubans that are trained to kill him.

1494
01:51:15,669 --> 01:51:17,754
And no one tells him how to run his unit,

1495
01:51:17,921 --> 01:51:20,840
least of all the Harvard mouth in his faggoty white uniform.

1496
01:51:21,008 --> 01:51:25,428
I need to shake him. I'll lead him right where he's dying to go.

1497
01:51:25,596 --> 01:51:28,264
That's it? That's the plan? That's the plan.

1498
01:51:28,432 --> 01:51:30,099
How are you going to do it?

1499
01:51:30,267 --> 01:51:33,770
- I have no idea. I need my bat. - Your what?

1500
01:51:33,937 --> 01:51:36,272
I need my bat. I think better with it. Where is it?

1501
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:39,609
I put it in the closet. You put it in the closet?

1502
01:51:39,860 --> 01:51:41,527
I was tripping on it.

1503
01:51:41,695 --> 01:51:43,780
Don't ever put that bat in the closet.

1504
01:51:59,171 --> 01:52:01,839
Stay here. I'm going to the office for a while.

1505
01:52:04,635 --> 01:52:07,220
He does think better with that bat.

1506
01:52:28,659 --> 01:52:32,995
Hello? Sam, I need you to do something.

1507
01:52:36,458 --> 01:52:39,752
What's going on? Gotta go out to Andrews.

1508
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:04,861
Where's Sam? He's on his way.

1509
01:53:05,028 --> 01:53:07,029
Did he get the guys? Yeah.

1510
01:53:07,197 --> 01:53:12,243
Listen, can I talk to you for a second? Yeah, sure.

1511
01:53:23,297 --> 01:53:24,714
How are you feeling?

1512
01:53:26,133 --> 01:53:30,511
Well, I think Jessep's gonna have his hands full today.

1513
01:53:32,931 --> 01:53:37,310
Listen, Danny, when you're out there today,

1514
01:53:37,478 --> 01:53:44,358
if you feel like it's not gonna happen, like he's not going to say it,

1515
01:53:44,526 --> 01:53:49,572
don't go for it. You could get into trouble.

1516
01:53:50,324 --> 01:53:54,660
I'm special counsel for Internal Affairs. I'm telling you you could get in trouble.

1517
01:53:54,828 --> 01:54:00,958
You're not suggesting that I back off a material witness?

1518
01:54:01,418 --> 01:54:04,253
If you think you can't get him, yeah.

1519
01:54:06,632 --> 01:54:08,216
All rise!

1520
01:54:13,305 --> 01:54:15,723
Where's Sam? He's on his way.

1521
01:54:21,647 --> 01:54:22,897
Call your first witness.

1522
01:54:23,065 --> 01:54:25,525
Where is he? He'll be here. Don't worry.

1523
01:54:25,692 --> 01:54:28,444
Lieutenant! Call your witness.

1524
01:54:35,327 --> 01:54:37,745
Defense calls Colonel Nathan Jessep.

1525
01:54:54,346 --> 01:54:57,306
Colonel Jessep, raise your right hand, please, sir.

1526
01:54:57,474 --> 01:55:01,686
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth,

1527
01:55:01,853 --> 01:55:04,355
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?

1528
01:55:04,648 --> 01:55:09,068
Yes, I do. Have a seat, please, sir.

1529
01:55:09,236 --> 01:55:12,488
State your name, rank and current billet for the record.

1530
01:55:13,323 --> 01:55:16,867
Colonel Jessep, Commanding Officer, Marine Ground Forces,

1531
01:55:17,035 --> 01:55:19,078
Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.

1532
01:55:19,246 --> 01:55:22,665
Thank you, sir. He's not here.

1533
01:55:27,504 --> 01:55:31,048
When you learned of Santiago's letter to the NIS,

1534
01:55:31,216 --> 01:55:34,844
you had a meeting with your two senior officers, is that right?

1535
01:55:35,012 --> 01:55:36,846
Yes.

1536
01:55:37,014 --> 01:55:39,682
Platoon Commander Kendrick

1537
01:55:39,850 --> 01:55:43,561
and the executive officer, Lieutenant Colonel Markinson.

1538
01:55:44,104 --> 01:55:45,187
Yes.

1539
01:55:45,355 --> 01:55:49,775
And, at present, Markinson is dead, is that right?

1540
01:55:49,943 --> 01:55:53,821
What is the counselor implying?

1541
01:55:53,989 --> 01:55:57,366
Simply that at present Markinson is not alive.

1542
01:55:57,534 --> 01:56:01,203
Surely Colonel Jessep doesn't need to confirm that.

1543
01:56:01,371 --> 01:56:05,625
I wasn't sure he was aware that Markinson took his own life two days ago.

1544
01:56:07,044 --> 01:56:11,130
The witness, the court and now the court members are aware.

1545
01:56:11,590 --> 01:56:16,552
We thank you for bringing it up. Move on, lieutenant.

1546
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:18,387
Yes, sir.

1547
01:56:18,555 --> 01:56:22,099
At this meeting, you gave Kendrick an order, right?

1548
01:56:22,267 --> 01:56:26,479
I told him to tell his men not to touch Santiago.

1549
01:56:26,813 --> 01:56:29,523
And did you give an order to Markinson as well?

1550
01:56:29,691 --> 01:56:34,987
I ordered him to have Santiago transferred off the base immediately.

1551
01:56:35,155 --> 01:56:40,826
Why? I felt his life might be in danger.

1552
01:56:41,244 --> 01:56:45,581
Grave danger? Is there another kind?

1553
01:56:48,502 --> 01:56:52,588
This is the transfer order that you and Markinson co-signed,

1554
01:56:52,756 --> 01:56:56,884
ordering that Santiago fly out at 6 the next morning.

1555
01:56:57,052 --> 01:57:02,014
Was that the first flight off the base? The 0600 was the first flight.

1556
01:57:06,228 --> 01:57:09,271
You flew here today, is that right? Yes.

1557
01:57:09,439 --> 01:57:14,276
You're wearing your dress uniform. As are you, lieutenant.

1558
01:57:14,444 --> 01:57:18,989
Did you wear it on the plane? Is this dialogue relevant to anything?

1559
01:57:19,157 --> 01:57:23,285
We didn't have a chance to depose this witness. I'd ask the court for a little latitude.

1560
01:57:23,453 --> 01:57:27,581
A very little latitude. Colonel?

1561
01:57:27,749 --> 01:57:29,667
I wore utilities on the plane.

1562
01:57:29,835 --> 01:57:32,795
You brought your dress uniform? Yes.

1563
01:57:32,963 --> 01:57:35,965
Toothbrush, shaving kit, underwear? Your Honor!

1564
01:57:36,133 --> 01:57:38,551
Is his underwear a matter of national security?

1565
01:57:38,719 --> 01:57:42,138
Gentlemen. You'd better get somewhere fast with this, lieutenant.

1566
01:57:42,305 --> 01:57:44,306
Yes, sir. Colonel?

1567
01:57:45,183 --> 01:57:49,145
I brought a change of clothes and some personal items.

1568
01:57:49,771 --> 01:57:51,230
Thank you.

1569
01:57:51,398 --> 01:57:54,817
After Dawson and Downey's arrest on the night of the 6th,

1570
01:57:54,985 --> 01:57:59,280
Santiago's barracks room was sealed off, and its contents inventoried.

1571
01:57:59,448 --> 01:58:04,034
Four pairs of camouflage pants, three khaki shirts, three pairs of boots.

1572
01:58:04,202 --> 01:58:09,498
Four pairs green socks… Is there a question in our future?

1573
01:58:09,833 --> 01:58:12,501
Lieutenant, state your question.

1574
01:58:13,003 --> 01:58:15,588
I'm wondering why Santiago wasn't packed.

1575
01:58:18,383 --> 01:58:21,469
Tell you what, we'll get back to that one in a minute.

1576
01:58:21,636 --> 01:58:25,473
This is a record of all phone calls from your base in the past 24 hours.

1577
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:28,893
After being subpoenaed, you made three calls.

1578
01:58:29,060 --> 01:58:31,520
Do you recognize those numbers?

1579
01:58:31,688 --> 01:58:37,443
I called Colonel Fitzhughes to let him know I'd be in town.

1580
01:58:37,611 --> 01:58:43,282
The second was to arrange a meeting with Congressman Richman.

1581
01:58:43,450 --> 01:58:48,537
And the third call was to my sister. Why did you make that call?

1582
01:58:48,997 --> 01:58:51,165
I thought she might like to have dinner.

1583
01:58:51,333 --> 01:58:53,125
Your Honor. I'll put a stop to this.

1584
01:58:53,293 --> 01:58:57,463
These are the phone records from Gitmo for September 6th.

1585
01:58:57,631 --> 01:59:02,927
And these are 14 letters that Santiago wrote in nine months

1586
01:59:03,094 --> 01:59:06,347
requesting, begging for a transfer.

1587
01:59:06,515 --> 01:59:09,308
Upon hearing the news he was getting it,

1588
01:59:09,476 --> 01:59:11,268
Santiago was so excited,

1589
01:59:11,436 --> 01:59:15,689
you know how many people he called? Zero! Nobody.

1590
01:59:16,107 --> 01:59:19,568
Not one call to his parents, saying he was coming home.

1591
01:59:19,736 --> 01:59:23,197
Not one call to a friend, saying, Can you pick me up?

1592
01:59:23,365 --> 01:59:29,411
He was asleep at midnight, and you say he had a flight in six hours.

1593
01:59:29,579 --> 01:59:35,918
Yet everything he owned was in his closet or his footlocker.

1594
01:59:36,086 --> 01:59:39,588
You were leaving for one day, you packed and made three calls.

1595
01:59:39,756 --> 01:59:45,970
Santiago was leaving for the rest of his life

1596
01:59:46,137 --> 01:59:50,975
and he hadn't called a soul, and he hadn't packed a thing.

1597
01:59:54,688 --> 01:59:56,272
Can you explain that?

1598
01:59:59,150 --> 02:00:03,863
Fact is, there was no transfer order. Santiago wasn't going anywhere, right?

1599
02:00:04,030 --> 02:00:09,785
Objection! Lieutenant Kaffee is trying to smear a high-ranking Marine officer,

1600
02:00:09,953 --> 02:00:12,288
desperately hoping to suggest impropriety

1601
02:00:12,455 --> 02:00:17,585
and win points with the court. I recommend that he be reprimanded

1602
02:00:17,752 --> 02:00:21,589
and the witness be excused with apologies.

1603
02:00:22,173 --> 02:00:28,596
Overruled. The objection is noted. Colonel?

1604
02:00:32,684 --> 02:00:37,146
Is this funny, sir? No, it's not. It's tragic.

1605
02:00:37,314 --> 02:00:39,940
Do you have an answer? Absolutely.

1606
02:00:40,108 --> 02:00:44,153
My answer is I don't have the first damn clue.

1607
02:00:44,321 --> 02:00:50,659
Maybe he was an early riser. Maybe he didn't have any friends.

1608
02:00:50,827 --> 02:00:54,246
I'm an educated man, but I can't speak intelligently

1609
02:00:54,414 --> 02:00:58,000
about the travel habits of William Santiago.

1610
02:00:58,168 --> 02:01:02,963
What I do know is that he was set to leave the base at 0600.

1611
02:01:03,798 --> 02:01:08,719
Now, are these really the questions that I was called here to answer?

1612
02:01:08,887 --> 02:01:11,347
Phone calls and foot lockers?

1613
02:01:11,806 --> 02:01:15,142
Please tell me you have something more, lieutenant.

1614
02:01:15,352 --> 02:01:18,938
These two Marines are on trial for their lives.

1615
02:01:19,105 --> 02:01:23,442
Please tell me their lawyer hasn't pinned their hopes to a phone bill.

1616
02:01:26,279 --> 02:01:29,365
Do you have any other questions for me, counselor?

1617
02:01:38,249 --> 02:01:40,876
Lieutenant Kaffee?

1618
02:01:48,218 --> 02:01:52,554
Lieutenant, do you have anything further for this witness?

1619
02:01:59,354 --> 02:02:04,149
Thanks, Danny. I love Washington. Excuse me. I didn't dismiss you.

1620
02:02:05,151 --> 02:02:09,780
I beg your pardon? I'm not through with my examination.

1621
02:02:09,948 --> 02:02:11,573
Sit down.

1622
02:02:13,410 --> 02:02:15,911
Colonel. What's that?

1623
02:02:16,079 --> 02:02:20,416
I'd appreciate if he would address me as colonel or sir. I've earned it.

1624
02:02:21,001 --> 02:02:24,545
Defense counsel will address the witness as colonel or sir.

1625
02:02:24,713 --> 02:02:27,756
I don't know what the hell kind of unit you're running here.

1626
02:02:27,924 --> 02:02:31,510
And the witness will address this court as judge or Your Honor.

1627
02:02:31,678 --> 02:02:33,512
I'm quite certain I've earned it.

1628
02:02:34,264 --> 02:02:38,225
Take your seat, colonel.

1629
02:02:41,396 --> 02:02:45,566
What shall we discuss now? My favorite color?

1630
02:02:46,568 --> 02:02:49,194
Colonel, the 6 a. M. Flight was the first off the base?

1631
02:02:49,362 --> 02:02:50,946
Yes.

1632
02:02:51,114 --> 02:02:55,200
There wasn't one seven hours earlier and landed at Andrews at 2 a. m.?

1633
02:02:55,368 --> 02:02:58,245
I think we've covered this, haven't we?

1634
02:02:59,080 --> 02:03:04,293
These are the tower chief's logs for Guantánamo Bay and Andrews.

1635
02:03:04,794 --> 02:03:10,299
There's no flight at 11 p. M., and no arrival at 2 a. m.

1636
02:03:10,467 --> 02:03:13,802
I'd like to admit them as Defense Exhibits Alpha and Bravo.

1637
02:03:13,970 --> 02:03:17,389
You're admitting evidence of a flight that never existed.

1638
02:03:17,557 --> 02:03:19,975
We believe it did, sir.

1639
02:03:20,143 --> 02:03:26,148
We call Airmen O'Malley and Rodriguez of Andrews Air Base.

1640
02:03:26,316 --> 02:03:28,025
They weren't on the list.

1641
02:03:28,193 --> 02:03:33,739
Rebuttal witnesses, Your Honor, called to refute testimony.

1642
02:03:33,907 --> 02:03:36,742
I'll allow the witnesses. This is ridiculous!

1643
02:03:37,077 --> 02:03:38,410
Colonel, a moment ago…

1644
02:03:38,578 --> 02:03:44,333
Check the logs, for chrissake! We'll get to that in a minute.

1645
02:03:45,418 --> 02:03:51,465
You said you ordered Kendrick to say that Santiago wasn't to be touched.

1646
02:03:51,633 --> 02:03:53,092
That's right.

1647
02:03:53,259 --> 02:03:57,763
He was clear on what you wanted? Crystal.

1648
02:03:58,681 --> 02:04:03,018
Could he have ignored the order? Ignored the order?

1649
02:04:03,186 --> 02:04:06,188
Or forgot about it? No.

1650
02:04:06,356 --> 02:04:10,359
Any chance he could have thought, The old man is wrong?

1651
02:04:10,985 --> 02:04:12,361
No.

1652
02:04:12,529 --> 02:04:18,033
When Lieutenant Kendrick spoke to the platoon, any chance they ignored him?

1653
02:04:19,494 --> 02:04:23,413
You ever served in the infantry, son? No, sir.

1654
02:04:23,581 --> 02:04:27,126
Ever served in a forward area? No, sir.

1655
02:04:27,544 --> 02:04:32,881
Ever put your life in another man's hands, and his in yours?

1656
02:04:33,049 --> 02:04:34,383
No, sir.

1657
02:04:34,551 --> 02:04:39,096
We follow orders, son. We follow orders or people die.

1658
02:04:39,264 --> 02:04:42,391
It's that simple. Are we clear?

1659
02:04:43,101 --> 02:04:44,351
Yes, sir.

1660
02:04:44,519 --> 02:04:48,897
Are we clear? Crystal.

1661
02:04:50,608 --> 02:04:54,820
Just one more question, before I call Airmen O'Malley and Rodriguez.

1662
02:04:56,114 --> 02:05:00,409
If you ordered that Santiago wasn't to be touched

1663
02:05:00,910 --> 02:05:04,705
and your orders are always followed,

1664
02:05:04,873 --> 02:05:09,084
then why would Santiago be in danger?

1665
02:05:10,044 --> 02:05:13,755
Why would it be necessary to transfer him off the base?

1666
02:05:19,554 --> 02:05:23,849
Santiago was a substandard Marine. He was being transferred…

1667
02:05:24,017 --> 02:05:27,978
You said he was being transferred because he was in grave danger.

1668
02:05:28,146 --> 02:05:30,272
That's correct. You said he was in danger.

1669
02:05:30,440 --> 02:05:32,608
I said, grave danger? You said… I recall…

1670
02:05:32,775 --> 02:05:34,276
I can have the reporter read…

1671
02:05:34,444 --> 02:05:37,362
I know what I said! I don't have to have it read back…

1672
02:05:37,530 --> 02:05:41,033
Then why the two orders? Colonel?

1673
02:05:43,161 --> 02:05:45,621
Sometimes men take matters into their own hands.

1674
02:05:45,788 --> 02:05:48,707
No, sir. You made it clear your men never do.

1675
02:05:48,875 --> 02:05:53,587
Your men follow orders or people die. So Santiago wasn't in danger, right?

1676
02:05:53,755 --> 02:05:55,881
You snotty little bastard.

1677
02:05:56,049 --> 02:05:57,466
Your Honor, I ask for a recess.

1678
02:05:57,634 --> 02:05:59,259
I'd like an answer.

1679
02:05:59,427 --> 02:06:01,220
The court will wait for an answer.

1680
02:06:02,055 --> 02:06:07,351
If Lieutenant Kendrick gave an order that Santiago wasn't to be touched,

1681
02:06:07,518 --> 02:06:12,272
then why did he have to be transferred? Colonel?

1682
02:06:12,440 --> 02:06:16,193
Kendrick ordered a Code Red because that's what you told him to do!

1683
02:06:16,361 --> 02:06:17,486
Object!

1684
02:06:17,654 --> 02:06:23,867
And when it went bad, you signed a phony transfer and doctored the logs!

1685
02:06:24,035 --> 02:06:25,702
You coerced the doctor!

1686
02:06:25,870 --> 02:06:28,997
Colonel Jessep, did you order the Code Red?

1687
02:06:29,165 --> 02:06:32,417
You don't have to answer that. I'll answer the question.

1688
02:06:32,585 --> 02:06:34,836
You want answers? I think I'm entitled!

1689
02:06:35,004 --> 02:06:37,256
You want answers? I want the truth!

1690
02:06:37,423 --> 02:06:40,550
You can't handle the truth!

1691
02:06:40,718 --> 02:06:45,013
Son, we live in a world that has walls, and those walls have to be guarded by men with guns.

1692
02:06:45,181 --> 02:06:49,685
Who's gonna do it? You? You, Lieutenant Weinberg?

1693
02:06:49,852 --> 02:06:53,689
I have a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom.

1694
02:06:53,856 --> 02:06:57,192
You weep for Santiago and you curse the Marines.

1695
02:06:57,360 --> 02:07:01,196
You have that luxury. The luxury of not knowing what I know:

1696
02:07:01,364 --> 02:07:05,325
That Santiago's death, while tragic, probably saved lives.

1697
02:07:05,493 --> 02:07:11,290
And my existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves lives!

1698
02:07:11,457 --> 02:07:13,417
You don't want the truth because deep down,

1699
02:07:13,584 --> 02:07:15,711
in places you don't talk about at parties,

1700
02:07:15,878 --> 02:07:20,590
you want me on that wall. You need me on that wall.

1701
02:07:20,758 --> 02:07:25,262
We use words like honor, code, loyalty.

1702
02:07:25,430 --> 02:07:28,849
We use them as the backbone of a life spent defending something.

1703
02:07:29,017 --> 02:07:31,059
You use them as a punch line!

1704
02:07:31,227 --> 02:07:34,980
I have neither the time nor inclination to explain myself

1705
02:07:35,148 --> 02:07:39,609
to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the freedom I provide,

1706
02:07:39,777 --> 02:07:42,154
and then questions the manner in which I provide it!

1707
02:07:42,322 --> 02:07:45,365
I would rather you just said thank you and went on your way.

1708
02:07:45,533 --> 02:07:49,286
Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a weapon and stand a post.

1709
02:07:49,454 --> 02:07:54,249
Either way, I don't give a damn what you think you are entitled to!

1710
02:07:54,417 --> 02:07:56,918
Did you order the Code Red? I did the job…

1711
02:07:57,086 --> 02:08:00,422
Did you order the Code Red? You're goddamn right I did!

1712
02:08:11,476 --> 02:08:14,311
I suggest the members be dismissed

1713
02:08:14,479 --> 02:08:17,898
so we can move to an article 39A session.

1714
02:08:18,066 --> 02:08:22,694
The witness has rights. Captain Ross?

1715
02:08:27,241 --> 02:08:28,867
Jack?

1716
02:08:33,873 --> 02:08:37,250
The members of the court will retire until further instructed.

1717
02:08:37,960 --> 02:08:39,920
All rise.

1718
02:08:40,463 --> 02:08:42,756
What the hell is this?

1719
02:08:42,924 --> 02:08:46,510
Colonel, what's going on? I did my job, I'd do it again.

1720
02:08:46,677 --> 02:08:51,473
I'm going back to my base. You're not going anywhere.

1721
02:08:51,641 --> 02:08:55,936
- MP's, guard the colonel! - Yes, sir.

1722
02:08:57,188 --> 02:08:59,856
Captain Ross. What the hell is this?

1723
02:09:00,108 --> 02:09:02,484
Colonel Jessep, you have the right to remain silent.

1724
02:09:02,652 --> 02:09:07,072
I'm being charged with a crime? Is that what this is?

1725
02:09:07,240 --> 02:09:10,492
I'm being charged with a crime?

1726
02:09:10,660 --> 02:09:14,704
This is funny, that's what this is! This is…

1727
02:09:14,872 --> 02:09:18,166
I'm gonna rip the eyes out of your head and piss in your dead skull!

1728
02:09:18,334 --> 02:09:20,252
You fucked with the wrong Marine!

1729
02:09:20,420 --> 02:09:24,881
Colonel Jessep, do you understand your rights?

1730
02:09:29,846 --> 02:09:32,472
You fucking people.

1731
02:09:32,640 --> 02:09:35,517
You have no idea how to defend a nation.

1732
02:09:36,185 --> 02:09:41,148
All you did was weaken a country today, Kaffee. That's all you did.

1733
02:09:41,315 --> 02:09:46,319
You put peoples' lives in danger. Sweet dreams, son.

1734
02:09:46,487 --> 02:09:48,530
Don't call me son.

1735
02:09:48,698 --> 02:09:52,868
I'm a lawyer, and an officer in the United States Navy.

1736
02:09:53,035 --> 02:09:55,871
And you're under arrest, you son of a bitch.

1737
02:10:00,042 --> 02:10:02,169
The witness is excused.

1738
02:10:24,275 --> 02:10:27,736
All rise!

1739
02:10:36,871 --> 02:10:41,583
Have you reached a verdict? We have, sir.

1740
02:10:52,303 --> 02:10:57,849
Lance Corporal Dawson, Private First Class Downey.

1741
02:10:59,018 --> 02:11:03,271
On the charge of murder, the members find the accused

1742
02:11:03,439 --> 02:11:05,690
not guilty.

1743
02:11:06,442 --> 02:11:10,320
On the charge of conspiracy to commit murder,

1744
02:11:10,488 --> 02:11:15,742
the members find the accused not guilty.

1745
02:11:16,619 --> 02:11:20,747
On the charge of conduct unbecoming a United States Marine,

1746
02:11:20,915 --> 02:11:26,836
the members find the accused guilty as charged.

1747
02:11:28,214 --> 02:11:31,466
The accused are sentenced to time already served

1748
02:11:31,634 --> 02:11:36,429
and are ordered to be dishonorably discharged from the Marine Corps.

1749
02:11:37,682 --> 02:11:38,807
This court-martial is adjourned.

1750
02:11:40,226 --> 02:11:41,893
All rise.

1751
02:11:57,493 --> 02:11:59,995
What did that mean?

1752
02:12:01,789 --> 02:12:04,624
Hal?

1753
02:12:04,792 --> 02:12:07,836
What did that mean?

1754
02:12:09,964 --> 02:12:14,301
I don't understand. Colonel Jessep said he ordered the Code Red.

1755
02:12:14,468 --> 02:12:16,845
I know. He said he ordered the Code Red.

1756
02:12:17,013 --> 02:12:19,431
What did we do wrong? It's not that simple.

1757
02:12:19,599 --> 02:12:23,351
We did nothing wrong! Yeah, we did.

1758
02:12:26,439 --> 02:12:31,359
We were supposed to fight for people who couldn't fight for themselves.

1759
02:12:31,527 --> 02:12:34,154
We were supposed to fight for Willy.

1760
02:12:40,536 --> 02:12:46,458
Lieutenant Kaffee, I have to take these men for some paperwork.

1761
02:12:55,426 --> 02:12:58,386
Harold?

1762
02:13:00,514 --> 02:13:03,350
Sir?

1763
02:13:03,517 --> 02:13:06,061
You don't need a patch on your arm to have honor.

1764
02:13:09,774 --> 02:13:14,736
Ten-hut! There's an officer on deck.

1765
02:13:39,553 --> 02:13:44,891
Airmen O'Malley and Rodriguez, what exactly could they testify to?

1766
02:13:45,059 --> 02:13:50,188
Probably that they had absolutely no recollection of anything.

1767
02:13:50,356 --> 02:13:55,193
Strong witnesses. And handsome too, didn't you think?

1768
02:13:55,361 --> 02:13:57,904
I'll see you around. I gotta go arrest Kendrick.

1769
02:13:58,072 --> 02:14:00,532
Tell him I say hi.

1770
02:14:00,700 --> 02:14:04,786
Will do.
