00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,059
Elsa!

34
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:49,528
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up!

35
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,397
Anna, go back to sleep.

36
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,433
I just can't.

37
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:57,903
The sky is awake, so I'm awake.

38
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:59,838
So, we have to play.

39
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,940
Go play by yourself.

40
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:11,483
Do you want to build a snowman?

Oh...

00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,167

00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,206
This is amazing!

00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,753
Hi, I'm Olaf,

00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:49,421

Tickle bumps!

00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,066
Oh!

Again!

58
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:09,741
Wait!

59
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:11,710
Whoo-hoo! Slow down!

60
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:14,513
Whoo!

61
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:16,248
Anna!

62
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,621
Anna!

63
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:27,259
Mama! Papa!

64
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,429
No, no...

65
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,636
You're okay, Anna. I got you.

66
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:40,572
Elsa, what have you done?

67
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:42,307
This is getting out of hand.

68
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:45,677
It was an accident.
I'm sorry, Anna!

69
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:49,581
Oh. She's ice cold.
I know where we have to go.

70
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:11,536
Ice?

71
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:15,907
Faster, Sven.

72
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:17,376
Sven!

73
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:24,316
Please! Help! It's my daughter.

74
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:36,395
It's the king.

75
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:40,966
Trolls? Shush!

76
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:43,068
I'm trying to listen.

77
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:47,172
Cuties. I'm going to keep you.

78
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:48,840
Your Majesty.

79
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,542
Born with the powers,
or cursed?

80
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:54,179
Born.
And they're getting stronger.

81
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:56,681
Here, here.

82
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:59,151
You are lucky
it wasn't her heart.

83
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:02,320
The heart is not
so easily changed.

84
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:05,457
But the head can be persuaded.

85
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:06,758
Do what you must.

86
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,694
I recommend
we remove all magic.

87
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:14,032
Even memories of magic,
to be safe.

88
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:19,004
But don't worry.
I'll leave the fun.

89
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:24,976
She will be okay.

90
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:27,979
But she won't remember
I have powers?

91
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:28,747
It's for the best.

92
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:34,486
Listen to me, Elsa.
Your power will only grow.

93
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:38,356
There is beauty in it...

94
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:40,325
But also great danger.

95
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:43,862
You must learn to control it.

96
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:47,032
Fear will be your enemy.

97
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:50,335
No!

98
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:51,336
We'll protect her.

99
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:54,206
She can learn to control it.
I'm sure.

100
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,607
<i>Until then...</i>

101
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:57,776

102
00:07:57,778 --> 00:07:58,844
<i>We'll reduce the staff.</i>

103
00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:02,013
<i>We will limit her contact</i>

104
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:06,218

The gates will be opening soon.

Why do I have to wear this?

153
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:00,785

"Give me a snack."

158
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,167
What's the magic word?

159
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:17,001
"Please."

I can't believe they're
finally opening up the gates!

162
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:26,044
- And for a whole day!
- Faster, Percy!

163
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:31,850
Arendelle, our most
mysterious trade partner.

164
00:12:31,852 --> 00:12:33,718
Open those gates
so I may unlock

165
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,021
your secrets
and exploit your riches.

166
00:12:37,062 --> 00:12:38,022
Did I say that out loud?

167
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:39,758
Oh! Me sore eyes can't wait

168
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,459

I bet they are
absolutely lovely.

170
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:46,865

171
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:52,637

Oh. Sorry to wake you, ma'am.

No, no, no, you didn't.

I've been up for hours.

00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:06,484
Who is it?

177
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:08,019
Still me, ma'am.

178
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:11,089
The gates will open soon.
Time to get ready.

179
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:13,458
Of course.

180
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,459
Ready for what?

181
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:17,195
Your sister's coronation,
ma'am.

182
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:20,131
My sister's corneration.

183
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,536
It's Coronation Day!

184

Are you sure?

Yeah. I just wasn't
looking where I was going.

Prince Hans
of the Southern Isles.

Princess Anna of Arendelle.

268
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:32,617

Oh!

270
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,653

Oh, boy!

274
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,126
This is awkward.

275
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:43,661
Not "You're awkward,"
but just because we're...

276
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:46,497
I'm awkward, you're gorgeous.
Wait, what?

277
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:47,598
I'd like to formally apologize

278
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,868
for hitting the princess
of Arendelle with my horse.

279
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,737
And for every moment after.

280
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,305
No! No, no. It's fine.

281
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:55,373
I'm not that princess.

282
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,974
I mean, if you
had hit my sister Elsa,

283
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:59,210
it would be... Yeesh!

284
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:00,745
Because, you know...

285
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,346
Hello.

286
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:03,848
But, lucky you,

287
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:06,417
it's just me.

288
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,052
"Just" you?

289
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,761
The bells. The coronation.

290
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,463
I better go.

291
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:22,100
I have to go.
I better go. Uh...

292
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:23,768
Bye!

293
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:27,271
Oh, no. Oh!

294
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:11,782
Your Majesty, the gloves.

295
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:45,082
Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

296
00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:48,119

Oh. Here? Are you sure?

300
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:20,618
Because I don't think
I'm supposed to...

301
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,320
Oh. Okay.

302
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:32,296
Hi.

303
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:34,232
"Hi" me? Oh...

304
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:36,267
Um... Hi.

Thank you.
You look beautiful-ler.

307
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,473
I mean, not "fuller."
You don't look fuller.

308
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:43,608
But more beautiful.

309
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:46,110
Thank you.

310
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:47,878
So...

311
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,581
This is what a party
looks like.

312
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,717
It's warmer than I thought.

313
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:55,286
What is that amazing smell?

314
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:59,657
Chocolate.

315
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,328
Your Majesty.

316
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:07,598
The Duke of Weaseltown.
"Weselton"!

317
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,367
Duke of Weselton, Your Majesty.

318
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:13,204
As your closest partner in
trade it seems only fitting

319
00:21:13,206 --> 00:21:14,238
that I offer you

320
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,207
your first dance as queen.

321
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:18,309
One-two, and jump.

322
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:23,080
Uh...

323
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:25,650
Thank you. Only, I don't dance.

324
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:26,584
Oh...

325
00:21:26,586 --> 00:21:28,786
But my sister does.

326
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,021
What? Oh! Lucky you.

327
00:21:30,023 --> 00:21:30,821
Oh, I don't think...

328
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:34,091
If you swoon,
let me know. I'll catch you.

329
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:35,359
Sorry.

330
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:36,961
Like an agile peacock.

331
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:38,763
Ow! Ow.

332
00:21:38,765 --> 00:21:41,799
Speaking of, so great
to have the gates open.

333
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:44,168
Why did they shut them
in the first place?

334
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:47,238
Do you know the reason? Hmm?

335
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,572
No. No.

336
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:50,675
All right. Hang on!

337
00:21:50,677 --> 00:21:51,475
They don't call me

338
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,744
the "Little Dipper"
for nothing!

339
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:54,178
Oh-ho!

340
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:58,316
Like a chicken with the face
of a monkey, I fly.

341
00:21:58,318 --> 00:21:59,550
Your Majesty.

342
00:21:59,552 --> 00:22:00,918
Let me know when you're ready

343
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,986
for another round, Milady.

344
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:05,389
Well, he was sprightly.

345
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:07,291
Especially for a man in heels.

346
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:09,427
Are you okay?

347
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:13,631
I've never been better.
This is so nice.

348
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:17,068
I wish it could be
like this all the time.

349
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:18,903
Me, too.

350
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:22,940
But it can't.

351
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:25,843
Why not? It just can't.

352
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:32,717
Excuse me for a minute.

353
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:40,191
I'd be honored.

354
00:22:41,227 --> 00:22:42,727
Glad I caught you.

355
00:22:42,729 --> 00:22:44,261
Hans.

356
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:46,330
Oop.

357
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:56,073
I often had a whole parlor
to myself to slide!

358
00:22:56,075 --> 00:22:58,075
Oh! Oops!

359
00:22:58,077 --> 00:22:59,343
Sorry.

360
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:00,978
Your physique helps,
I'm sure, too.

361
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,947
Ah.

362
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:07,952
What's this?

363
00:23:07,954 --> 00:23:09,153
Uh, I was born with it.

364
00:23:09,155 --> 00:23:12,056
Although, I dreamed
I was kissed by a troll.

365
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:13,124
I like it.

366
00:23:13,126 --> 00:23:15,192
Yeah, the whole thing.

367
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:15,826
You got it.

368
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:19,363
Okay, wait, wait. So, you
have how many brothers?

369
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:20,998
Twelve older brothers.

370
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,001
Three of them
pretended I was invisible,

371
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:26,036
literally, for two years.

372
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:27,538
That's horrible.

373
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,240
It's what brothers do.

374
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:30,241
And sisters.

375
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:32,943
Elsa and I were really close
when we were little.

376
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:36,680
But then, one day,
she just shut me out,

377
00:23:36,682 --> 00:23:39,683
and I never knew why.

378
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:41,986
I would never shut you out.

379
00:23:43,523 --> 00:23:47,158
Okay, can I just say
something crazy?

380
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:47,792
I love crazy.

Can I say something
even crazier?

424
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:37,368
Yes!

425
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:42,106
- Coming through.
- Excuse me. Oh...

426
00:25:42,108 --> 00:25:43,874
Pardon. Sorry. Oh!

427
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:46,043
Can we just get
around you there?

428
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:48,345
Thank you. Oh! There she is.

429
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:48,913
Elsa!

430
00:25:48,915 --> 00:25:51,549
I mean, Queen. Me again. Um...

431
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:56,086
May I present Prince Hans
of the Southern Isles.

432
00:25:56,088 --> 00:25:58,055
Your Majesty.

433
00:25:58,057 --> 00:25:58,856
We would like...

434
00:25:58,858 --> 00:26:01,725
Uh, your blessing...

435
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:03,861
Of our marriage.

436
00:26:03,863 --> 00:26:05,996
Marriage? Yes!

437
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:06,864
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

438
00:26:06,866 --> 00:26:09,199
Well, we haven't worked out
all the details ourselves.

439
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:10,401
We'll need a few days
to plan the ceremony.

440
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:13,871
Of course, we'll have soup, roast
and ice cream. And then...

441
00:26:13,873 --> 00:26:15,239
Wait. Would we live here?

442
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:17,374
Here? Absolutely!

443
00:26:17,376 --> 00:26:18,208
Anna! Oh!

444
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,177
We can invite all 12 of your
brothers to stay with us.

445
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:20,878
What? No, no, no.

446
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,914
Of course we have the room.
Wait, slow down.

447
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,783
No one's brothers
are staying here.

448
00:26:25,785 --> 00:26:27,751
No one is getting married.

449
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:28,452
Wait, what?

450
00:26:28,454 --> 00:26:31,755
May I talk to you, please?
Alone.

451
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:36,327
No. Whatever you have to say,
you can say to both of us.

452
00:26:36,329 --> 00:26:39,830
Fine. You can't marry
a man you just met.

453
00:26:39,832 --> 00:26:41,365
You can if it's true love.

454
00:26:41,367 --> 00:26:43,901
Anna, what do you know
about true love?

455
00:26:43,903 --> 00:26:44,468
More than you.

456
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,971
All you know is how
to shut people out.

457
00:26:47,974 --> 00:26:52,109
You asked for my blessing,
but my answer is no.

458
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:53,811
Now, excuse me.

459
00:26:53,813 --> 00:26:55,045
Your Majesty,
if I may ease your...

460
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:58,215
No, you may not.
And I think you should go.

461
00:26:58,217 --> 00:27:00,150
The party is over.
Close the gates.

462
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:01,352
Yes, Your Majesty. What?

463
00:27:01,354 --> 00:27:03,253
Elsa, no, no! Wait.

464
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:04,421
Give me my glove!

465
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:05,689
Elsa, please, please.

466
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:08,592
I can't live like this anymore!

467
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:11,495
Then leave.

468
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:18,302
What did I ever do to you?

469
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:19,303
Enough, Anna.

470
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:21,639
No, why?
Why do you shut me out?

471
00:27:21,641 --> 00:27:23,273
Why do you shut the world out?

472
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:25,476
What are you so afraid of?

473
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:27,611
I said, enough!

474
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:36,286
Sorcery.

475
00:27:36,288 --> 00:27:40,224
I knew there was something
dubious going on here.

476
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:42,192
Elsa.

477
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:50,434
There she is!

478
00:27:55,641 --> 00:27:57,908
Yes! It is her!

479
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,643
Queen Elsa.

480
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:01,545
Our beautiful queen!

481
00:28:01,547 --> 00:28:04,882
Your Majesty?
Are you all right?

482
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:07,217
No.

483
00:28:16,262 --> 00:28:17,327
There she is! Stop her!

484
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:20,130
Please, just stay away
from me. Stay away.

485
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:25,903
Monster. Monster!

486
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:34,945
Elsa!

487
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:42,886
Elsa!

488
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:49,226
Wait, please!

489
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,373
Elsa, stop!

490
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:04,675
Anna!

491
00:29:04,677 --> 00:29:06,176
No.

492
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:13,117
The fjord.

493
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:33,804
Snow! Snow?

494
00:29:33,806 --> 00:29:34,471
Yes, snow.

495
00:29:34,473 --> 00:29:36,840
Are you all right? No.

496
00:29:36,842 --> 00:29:38,742
Did you know?

497
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:40,377
No.

498
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:42,045
Look, it's snowing.
It's snowing!

499
00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:43,714
The queen has cursed this land!

500
00:29:43,716 --> 00:29:46,383
She must be stopped!
You have to go after her.

501
00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:47,417
Wait, no!

502
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:50,220
You! Is there sorcery
in you, too?

503
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:51,755
Are you a monster, too?

504
00:29:51,757 --> 00:29:54,925
No, no.
I'm completely ordinary.

505
00:29:54,927 --> 00:29:56,994
That's right, she is.

506
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:58,962
In the best way.

507
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:00,631
And my sister is not a monster.

508
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:01,965
She nearly killed me!

509
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:03,300
You slipped on ice. Her ice.

510
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:05,869
It was an accident.
She was scared.

511
00:30:05,871 --> 00:30:09,206
She didn't mean it.
She didn't mean any of this.

512
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:12,142
Tonight was my fault.
I pushed her.

513
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:13,243
So, I'm the one

514
00:30:13,245 --> 00:30:14,478
that needs to go after her.
What?

515
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,281
Bring me my horse, please.
Anna, no.

516
00:30:17,283 --> 00:30:18,282
It's too dangerous.

517
00:30:18,284 --> 00:30:20,517
Elsa is not dangerous.

518
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:22,786
I'll bring her back,
and I'll make this right.

519
00:30:22,788 --> 00:30:23,520
I'm coming with you.

520
00:30:23,522 --> 00:30:27,758
No, I need you here
to take care of Arendelle.

521
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:29,760
On my honor.

522
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:33,397
I leave Prince Hans in charge.

523
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,800
Are you sure you can trust her?

524
00:30:36,802 --> 00:30:39,036
I don't want you getting hurt.

525
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:40,771
She's my sister.

526
00:30:40,773 --> 00:30:42,673
She would never hurt me.

Elsa!

579
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:56,460
Elsa, it's me, Anna,

580
00:34:56,462 --> 00:35:00,030
your sister who didn't mean
to make you freeze the summer.

581
00:35:00,032 --> 00:35:04,134
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

582
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:07,004
Of course, none of it
would have happened

583
00:35:07,005 --> 00:35:09,973
if she had just told
me her secret.

584
00:35:09,975 --> 00:35:12,142
She's a stinker.

585
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,377
Whoa!

586
00:35:16,715 --> 00:35:18,415
Oh, no. No, no, no! Come back!

587
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:20,383
No, no, no!

588
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:22,619
Okay.

589
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:31,261
Snow. It had to be snow.

590
00:35:31,263 --> 00:35:33,497
She couldn't have
had tropical magic

591
00:35:33,499 --> 00:35:37,968
that covered the fjords
in white sand and warm...

592
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:40,837
Fire!

593
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:50,680
Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold.

594
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:10,700
Ooh. "And sauna"!

595
00:36:15,741 --> 00:36:17,541
Yoo-hoo. Hmm?

596
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:19,276
Big summer blowout.

597
00:36:19,278 --> 00:36:21,811
Half off swimming suits, clogs,

598
00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:25,348
and a sun balm
of my own invention, yah?

599
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:29,953
Oh. Great. For now, um,
how about boots?

600
00:36:29,955 --> 00:36:31,988
Winter boots and dresses?

601
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:34,724
That would be
in our winter department.

602
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:38,929
Oh. Um...

603
00:36:38,931 --> 00:36:40,130
I was just wondering.

604
00:36:40,132 --> 00:36:42,032
Has another young woman...

605
00:36:42,034 --> 00:36:45,202
The queen perhaps,
I don't know,

606
00:36:45,204 --> 00:36:45,936
passed through here?

607
00:36:45,938 --> 00:36:47,771
The only one crazy enough
to be out in this storm

608
00:36:47,773 --> 00:36:49,673
is you, dear.

609
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:58,281
You and this fellow.

610
00:36:58,283 --> 00:36:58,949
Yoo-hoo.

611
00:36:58,951 --> 00:37:00,784
Big summer blowout.

612
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:06,790
Carrots.

613
00:37:06,792 --> 00:37:08,225
Huh?

614
00:37:08,227 --> 00:37:10,093
Behind you.

615
00:37:10,095 --> 00:37:12,529
Oh! Right. Excuse me.

616
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:15,398
Oh. A real howler in July, yes?

617
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,335
Wherever could it be
coming from?

618
00:37:18,337 --> 00:37:20,570
The North Mountain.

619
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:22,239
North Mountain.

620
00:37:22,241 --> 00:37:23,773
That will be 40.

621
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:25,408
Forty? No, 10.

622
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,443
Oh, dear, that's no good.

623
00:37:26,445 --> 00:37:28,311
See, this is from
our winter stock,

624
00:37:28,313 --> 00:37:29,980
where supply and demand
have a big problem.

625
00:37:29,982 --> 00:37:32,949
You want to talk about
a supply and demand problem?

626
00:37:32,951 --> 00:37:33,783
I sell ice for a living.

627
00:37:33,785 --> 00:37:36,152
Ooh. That's a rough business
to be in right now.

628
00:37:36,154 --> 00:37:38,622
I mean, that is really...

629
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:40,590
That's unfortunate.

630
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:41,157
Still 40.

631
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:43,960
But I will throw in
a visit to Oaken's sauna.

632
00:37:43,962 --> 00:37:46,296
Yoo-hoo. Hi, family.

633
00:37:46,298 --> 00:37:47,564
Yoo-hoo!

634
00:37:47,566 --> 00:37:50,300
Ten is all I got. Help me out.

635
00:37:50,302 --> 00:37:53,303
Okay. Ten will get you
this and no more.

636
00:37:53,305 --> 00:37:54,170
Okay, just tell me one thing.

637
00:37:54,172 --> 00:37:56,506
What was happening
on the North Mountain?

638
00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:58,608
Did it seem magical?

639
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,277
Yes!

640
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:04,014
Now, back up while I deal
with this crook, here.

641
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:08,618
What did you call me?

642
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:11,354
Okay, okay. I'm out.

643
00:38:11,356 --> 00:38:12,422
Whoa!

644
00:38:12,424 --> 00:38:14,257
Bye-bye.

645
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:21,231
No, Sven,
I didn't get your carrots.

646
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:24,267
But I did find us
a place to sleep.

647
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:26,503
And it's free.

648
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,805
I'm sorry about this violence.

649
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:30,940
I will add a quart of lutefisk,

650
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:32,108
so we have good feelings.

651
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:34,911
Just the outfit
and the boots, yah?

652
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,314

It's just you.
What do you want?

667
00:39:29,468 --> 00:39:32,535
I want you to take me up
the North Mountain.

668
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:37,474
I don't take people places.

669
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:39,342
Let me rephrase that.

670
00:39:39,344 --> 00:39:41,277
Hey.

671
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:43,480
Take me up the North Mountain.

672
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:45,682

00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:53,289
Look, I know how
to stop this winter.

674
00:39:55,127 --> 00:39:56,693
We leave at dawn.

675
00:39:56,695 --> 00:39:59,629
And you forgot
the carrots for Sven.

676
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:00,964
Oops, sorry.

677
00:40:00,966 --> 00:40:04,234
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- I didn't...

678
00:40:04,236 --> 00:40:07,137
We leave now. Right now.

679
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:11,441
Whew!

680
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:20,016
Hang on! We like to go fast.

681
00:40:20,018 --> 00:40:22,852
I like fast. Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

682
00:40:22,854 --> 00:40:24,521
Get your feet down.
This is fresh lacquer.

683
00:40:24,523 --> 00:40:26,823
Seriously,
were you raised in a barn?

684
00:40:26,825 --> 00:40:27,524
Ugh!

685
00:40:27,526 --> 00:40:31,428
No, I was raised in a castle.
Hmm.

686
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,696
So, uh, tell me,

687
00:40:33,698 --> 00:40:36,232
what made the queen go
all ice-crazy?

688
00:40:36,234 --> 00:40:37,667
Oh. Well...

689
00:40:37,669 --> 00:40:38,601
It was all my fault.

690
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:40,770
I got engaged,
but then she freaked out,

691
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:44,140
because I'd only just
met him, you know, that day.

692
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:45,608
And she said she wouldn't
bless the marriage, and...

693
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:49,212
Wait. You got engaged to
someone you just met that day?

694
00:40:49,214 --> 00:40:52,982
Yeah. Anyway, I got mad,
and so she got mad,

695
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:54,350
and then she tried
to walk away,

696
00:40:54,352 --> 00:40:55,585
and I grabbed her glove...

697
00:40:55,587 --> 00:40:56,186
Hang on!

698
00:40:56,188 --> 00:40:58,054
You mean to tell me
you got engaged

699
00:40:58,056 --> 00:41:01,291
to someone you just
met that day?

700
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:01,891
Yes. Pay attention.

701
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:04,961
But the thing is, she wore
the gloves all the time

702
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:07,564
so, I just thought, maybe she
has a thing about dirt.

703
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:10,867
Didn't your parents ever
warn you about strangers?

704
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:13,803
Yes, they did.

705
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:16,372
But Hans is not a stranger.

706
00:41:16,374 --> 00:41:18,208
Oh, yeah? What's his last name?

707
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:20,610
"Of the Southern Isles."

708
00:41:20,612 --> 00:41:22,111
What's his favorite food?
Sandwiches.

709
00:41:22,113 --> 00:41:24,013
Best friend's name?
Probably John.

710
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:24,647
Eye color? Dreamy.

711
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:25,982
Foot size?
Foot size doesn't matter.

712
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,750
Have you had a meal
with him yet?

713
00:41:27,752 --> 00:41:28,952
What if you hate
the way he eats?

714
00:41:28,954 --> 00:41:31,321
What if you hate
the way he picks his nose?

715
00:41:31,323 --> 00:41:32,555
Picks his nose?

716
00:41:32,557 --> 00:41:33,356
And eats it.

717
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:36,593
Excuse me, sir. He is a prince.

718
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:38,394
All men do it. Ew.

719
00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:41,898
Look, it doesn't matter.
It's true love.

720
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:42,765
It doesn't sound
like true love.

721
00:41:42,767 --> 00:41:46,102
Are you some
sort of love expert?

722
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:49,405
No. But, uh, I have
friends who are.

723
00:41:49,407 --> 00:41:50,240
You have friends

724
00:41:50,242 --> 00:41:52,842
who are love experts?
I'm not buying it.

725
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:54,344
Stop talking.
No, no, no. No, no.

726
00:41:54,346 --> 00:41:57,046
I'd like to meet these...
No, I mean it.

727
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:12,862
Sven, go.

728
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:14,364
Go!

729
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:16,266
What are they? Wolves.

730
00:42:16,268 --> 00:42:17,700
Wolves?

731
00:42:19,296 --> 00:42:20,336
What do we do? I got this.

732
00:42:20,338 --> 00:42:23,239
You just... Don't fall off,
and don't get eaten.

733
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:24,440
But I want to help!

734
00:42:24,442 --> 00:42:25,041
No. Why not?

735
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:26,609
Because I don't
trust your judgment.

736
00:42:26,611 --> 00:42:27,377
Excuse me?

737
00:42:27,379 --> 00:42:29,746
Who marries a man she just met?

738
00:42:29,748 --> 00:42:30,880
It's true love!

739
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:32,448
Whoa!

740
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:33,917
Whoa. Whoa!

741
00:42:33,919 --> 00:42:35,618
Christopher!

742
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,886
It's "Kristoff"!

743
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:38,788
Ow!

744
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:42,892
Duck!

745
00:42:46,665 --> 00:42:48,364
You almost set me on fire!

746
00:42:48,366 --> 00:42:49,499
But I didn't.

747
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:57,140
Get ready to jump, Sven!

748
00:42:57,142 --> 00:42:58,808
You don't tell him what to do.

749
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:00,777
Hey! I do!

750
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:02,712
Jump, Sven!

751
00:43:12,557 --> 00:43:14,090
Phew!

752
00:43:16,962 --> 00:43:18,895
But I just paid it off.

753
00:43:18,897 --> 00:43:21,030
Uh-oh. No. No.

754
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:21,764
No!

755
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:24,067
Ah! No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

756
00:43:24,069 --> 00:43:25,602
Grab on!

757
00:43:25,604 --> 00:43:26,636
Pull, Sven. Pull!

758
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,913
Whoa.

759
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:42,652
I'll replace your sled,
and everything in it.

760
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:48,257
And I understand if you don't
want to help me anymore.

761
00:43:52,597 --> 00:43:55,164
Of course I don't want to help
her anymore. In fact,

762
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:59,535
this whole thing has ruined me
for helping anyone ever again.

763
00:43:59,537 --> 00:44:00,470
It's this way?

764
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:02,205
"She'll die on her own."

765
00:44:02,207 --> 00:44:03,940
- I can live with that.
- Here we go.

766
00:44:03,942 --> 00:44:07,543
"But you won't get
your new sled if she's dead."

767
00:44:07,545 --> 00:44:09,312
I think, actually, it's up.

768
00:44:09,314 --> 00:44:10,513
Sometimes,
I really don't like you.

769
00:44:10,515 --> 00:44:13,883
Hold up! We're coming.

770
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:14,584
You are?

771
00:44:14,586 --> 00:44:18,187
I mean, sure.
I'll let you tag along.

772
00:44:29,234 --> 00:44:30,833
Arendelle.

773
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:33,870
It's completely frozen.

774
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:37,607
But it will be fine.
Elsa will thaw it.

775
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:38,875
Will she?

776
00:44:38,877 --> 00:44:40,410
Yeah. Now, come on.

777
00:44:40,412 --> 00:44:42,578
This way to the North Mountain?

778
00:44:43,381 --> 00:44:47,016
More like this way.

779
00:45:17,614 --> 00:45:22,118
I never knew winter
could be so beautiful.

780
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:23,753
Yeah.

781
00:45:23,755 --> 00:45:26,589
It really is beautiful,
isn't it?

782
00:45:26,591 --> 00:45:28,057
But it's so white.

783
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:29,659
You know,
how about a little color?

784
00:45:29,661 --> 00:45:33,629
I'm thinking maybe some
crimson, chartreuse.

785
00:45:33,631 --> 00:45:35,231
How about yellow?

786
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:37,633
No, not yellow.
Yellow and snow?

787
00:45:37,635 --> 00:45:39,068
No go.

788
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:44,540
Am I right?

789
00:45:44,542 --> 00:45:45,475
Hi. You're creepy.

790
00:45:45,477 --> 00:45:46,576
Whoa! I don't want it.

791
00:45:46,578 --> 00:45:48,144
- Back at you.
- Please don't drop me.

792
00:45:48,146 --> 00:45:49,312
No. Come on, it's just a head.

793
00:45:49,314 --> 00:45:51,180
All right.
We got off to a bad start.

794
00:45:51,182 --> 00:45:53,015
Ew, ew, ew, the body!

795
00:45:56,187 --> 00:45:57,754
Wait, what am I looking
at right now?

796
00:45:57,756 --> 00:46:00,757
Why are you hanging off
the earth like a bat?

797
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:02,792
All right, wait one second.

798
00:46:02,794 --> 00:46:04,227
Oh. Uh...

799
00:46:04,229 --> 00:46:05,061
Oh!

800
00:46:05,063 --> 00:46:06,829
Thank you. You're welcome.

801
00:46:06,831 --> 00:46:08,030
Now, I'm perfect.

802
00:46:09,334 --> 00:46:10,199
Well, almost.

803
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:12,401
It was like my whole life
got turned upside down.

804
00:46:12,403 --> 00:46:14,737
Oh! Too hard. I'm sorry!

805
00:46:14,739 --> 00:46:16,239
Head rush! I was just...
Are you okay?

806
00:46:16,241 --> 00:46:20,143
Are you kidding me?
I am wonderful!

807
00:46:20,145 --> 00:46:22,345
I've always wanted a nose.

808
00:46:22,347 --> 00:46:23,312
So cute.

809
00:46:23,314 --> 00:46:24,847
It's like a little
baby unicorn.

810
00:46:24,849 --> 00:46:26,582
But... Hey! Whoa!

811
00:46:26,584 --> 00:46:27,517
Oh.

812
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:29,018
I love it even more.

813
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:32,755
All right,
let's start this thing over.

814
00:46:32,757 --> 00:46:34,023
Hi, everyone.

815
00:46:34,025 --> 00:46:34,757
I'm Olaf.

816
00:46:34,759 --> 00:46:36,626
And I like warm hugs.

817
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,228
Olaf?

818
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:44,333
That's right. Olaf.

819
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:47,270
And you are?

820
00:46:47,272 --> 00:46:48,905
Oh. Um...

821
00:46:48,907 --> 00:46:49,338
I'm Anna.

822
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:52,008
And who's the funky-looking
donkey over there?

823
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:53,709
That's Sven. Uh-huh.

824
00:46:53,711 --> 00:46:55,645
And who's the reindeer?

825
00:46:55,879 --> 00:46:56,379
Sven.

826
00:46:56,381 --> 00:46:59,115
Oh, the... Oh. Okay. That
makes things easier for me.

827
00:46:59,117 --> 00:47:02,251
Aw, look at him
trying to kiss my nose.

828
00:47:02,253 --> 00:47:04,554
I like you, too. Olaf.

829
00:47:04,556 --> 00:47:06,956
Did Elsa build you? Yeah. Why?

830
00:47:06,958 --> 00:47:08,057
Do you know where she is?

831
00:47:08,059 --> 00:47:09,025
Fascinating. Yeah. Why?

832
00:47:09,027 --> 00:47:11,260
Do you think you could
show us the way?

833
00:47:11,262 --> 00:47:12,261
Yeah. Why?

834
00:47:12,263 --> 00:47:12,929
How does this work? Ow!

835
00:47:12,931 --> 00:47:15,565
Stop it, Sven.
I'm trying to focus, here.

836
00:47:15,567 --> 00:47:17,934
Yeah. Why? I'll tell you why.

837
00:47:17,936 --> 00:47:20,303
We need Elsa
to bring back summer.

838
00:47:20,305 --> 00:47:22,004
Summer? Mmm-hmm.

839
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:22,738
Oh. I don't know why,

840
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:26,709
but I've always loved
the idea of summer.

841
00:47:26,711 --> 00:47:30,913
And sun, and all things hot.

842
00:47:30,915 --> 00:47:31,380
Really?

843
00:47:31,382 --> 00:47:34,483
I'm guessing you don't have
much experience with heat.

844
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:35,084
Nope.

845
00:47:35,086 --> 00:47:37,453
But sometimes
I like to close my eyes,

846
00:47:37,455 --> 00:47:42,625
and imagine what it would be
like when summer does come.

847
00:47:44,562 --> 00:47:48,865

876
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:21,791
So, come on! Elsa's this way.

877
00:49:21,793 --> 00:49:24,961
Let's go bring back summer!

878
00:49:24,963 --> 00:49:27,129
I'm coming!

879
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:30,433
Somebody's gotta tell him.

880
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:37,340
No, no. You've got
the bark facing down.

881
00:49:37,342 --> 00:49:38,941
The bark needs to be face-up.

882
00:49:38,943 --> 00:49:41,410
- Bark down is drier.
- Bark up!

883
00:49:41,412 --> 00:49:42,411
Bark down! Papa!

884
00:49:42,413 --> 00:49:43,980
Cloak? Does anyone
need a cloak?

885
00:49:43,982 --> 00:49:47,583
Arendelle is indebted
to you, Your Highness.

886
00:49:47,585 --> 00:49:48,551
The castle is open.

887
00:49:48,553 --> 00:49:52,288
There is soup and hot glogg
in the great hall.

888
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:53,422
Here, pass these out.

889
00:49:53,424 --> 00:49:54,623
Prince Hans!

890
00:49:54,625 --> 00:49:56,826
Are we expected
to just sit here and freeze

891
00:49:56,828 --> 00:50:00,129
while you give away all
of Arendelle's tradable goods?

892
00:50:00,131 --> 00:50:01,931
Princess Anna
has given her orders.

893
00:50:01,933 --> 00:50:02,631
And that's another thing!

894
00:50:02,633 --> 00:50:06,335
Has it dawned on you that your
princess may be conspiring

895
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:07,703
with a wicked sorceress

896
00:50:07,705 --> 00:50:08,337
to destroy us all?

897
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:10,639
Do not question the princess.

898
00:50:10,641 --> 00:50:11,807
She left me in charge

899
00:50:11,809 --> 00:50:12,842
and I will not hesitate

900
00:50:12,844 --> 00:50:15,077
to protect Arendelle
from treason.

901
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:16,846
Treason?

902
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:23,185
Whoa! Whoa!

903
00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:25,221
Whoa, boy. Easy.

904
00:50:25,223 --> 00:50:26,055
Easy.

905
00:50:26,057 --> 00:50:27,323
It's Princess Anna's horse.

906
00:50:27,325 --> 00:50:28,991
So, where is the princess?

907
00:50:28,993 --> 00:50:31,494
- Where could she be?
- Where is she?

908
00:50:31,496 --> 00:50:33,329
Princess Anna is in trouble.

909
00:50:33,331 --> 00:50:36,499
I need volunteers to go
with me to find her.

910
00:50:36,501 --> 00:50:37,633
I'll go. I volunteer.

911
00:50:37,635 --> 00:50:40,469
I volunteer two men, My Lord.

912
00:50:40,471 --> 00:50:41,904
Be prepared for anything.

913
00:50:41,906 --> 00:50:44,173
And should you encounter
the queen,

914
00:50:44,175 --> 00:50:47,777
you are to put an end
to this winter.

915
00:50:47,779 --> 00:50:50,012
Do you understand? Hmm.

916
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:56,986
So, how exactly are you
planning to stop this weather?

917
00:50:56,988 --> 00:50:59,755
Oh. I am gonna
talk to my sister.

918
00:50:59,757 --> 00:51:00,322
That's your plan?

919
00:51:00,324 --> 00:51:03,826
My ice business is riding on
you talking to your sister?

920
00:51:03,828 --> 00:51:05,227
Yep.

921
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:07,463
So, you're not at all
afraid of her?

922
00:51:07,465 --> 00:51:08,764
Why would I be? Yeah.

923
00:51:08,766 --> 00:51:14,570
I bet she's the nicest,
gentlest, warmest person ever.

924
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:15,871
Oh. Look at that.

925
00:51:15,873 --> 00:51:19,141
I've been impaled.

926
00:51:23,046 --> 00:51:24,447
What now?

927
00:51:24,648 --> 00:51:26,916
Mmm...

928
00:51:27,283 --> 00:51:27,883
It's too steep.

929
00:51:27,885 --> 00:51:30,719
I've only got one rope and you
don't know how to climb mountains.

930
00:51:30,721 --> 00:51:32,455
Says who?

931
00:51:32,457 --> 00:51:33,823
Hmm?

932
00:51:33,825 --> 00:51:34,957
What are you doing?

933
00:51:34,959 --> 00:51:39,195
I'm going to see my sister.

934
00:51:39,197 --> 00:51:40,429
You're gonna kill yourself.

935
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:43,132
I wouldn't put my foot there.

936
00:51:43,134 --> 00:51:44,467
You're distracting me.
Or there.

937
00:51:44,469 --> 00:51:46,535
How do you know
Elsa even wants to see you?

938
00:51:46,537 --> 00:51:48,370
All right.
I'm just blocking you out

939
00:51:48,372 --> 00:51:51,440
because I gotta
concentrate, here.

940
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:53,042
You know,
most people who disappear

941
00:51:53,044 --> 00:51:55,211
into the mountains
want to be alone.

942
00:51:55,213 --> 00:51:57,813
Nobody wants to be alone.

943
00:51:57,815 --> 00:51:58,614
Except maybe you.

944
00:51:58,616 --> 00:52:02,585
I'm not alone.
I have friends, remember?

945
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:05,020
You mean, the love experts?

946
00:52:05,022 --> 00:52:07,523
Yes, the love experts.

947
00:52:07,591 --> 00:52:09,391
Ah...

948
00:52:09,393 --> 00:52:11,994
Please tell me
I'm almost there.

949
00:52:12,062 --> 00:52:14,763
Does the air seem a bit thin
to you up here?

950
00:52:16,701 --> 00:52:17,733
Hang on.

951
00:52:17,735 --> 00:52:18,367
Hey, Sven?

952
00:52:18,369 --> 00:52:20,236
Not sure if this is gonna
solve the problem

953
00:52:20,238 --> 00:52:22,738
but I found a staircase
that leads exactly

954
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:23,739
where you wanted to go.

955
00:52:23,741 --> 00:52:26,208
Ha-ha! Thank goodness. Catch!

956
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:30,813
Thanks. That was like
a crazy trust exercise.

957
00:52:44,095 --> 00:52:45,194
Whoa.

958
00:52:45,196 --> 00:52:47,730
Now, that's ice.

959
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:49,131
I might cry.

960
00:52:49,133 --> 00:52:52,501
Go ahead. I won't judge.

961
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:01,143
All right, take it easy,
boy. Come here.

962
00:53:01,145 --> 00:53:03,112
I got you.

963
00:53:03,114 --> 00:53:05,581
Okay. You stay
right here, buddy.

964
00:53:07,885 --> 00:53:09,518
Flawless.

965
00:53:14,224 --> 00:53:15,824
Knock.

966
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:18,060
Just knock.

967
00:53:18,062 --> 00:53:20,663
Why isn't she knocking?

968
00:53:20,665 --> 00:53:23,065
Do you think
she knows how to knock?

969
00:53:27,137 --> 00:53:29,572
Huh. It opened.

970
00:53:29,574 --> 00:53:30,673
That's a first.

971
00:53:30,675 --> 00:53:33,409
Oh. You should probably
wait out here.

972
00:53:33,411 --> 00:53:36,111
What? The last time I
introduced her to a guy,

973
00:53:36,113 --> 00:53:37,213
she froze everything.

974
00:53:37,215 --> 00:53:38,681
But, but... Oh, come on!

975
00:53:38,683 --> 00:53:42,518
It's a palace made of ice.
Ice is my life!

976
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,619
Bye, Sven.

977
00:53:43,621 --> 00:53:45,254
You, too, Olaf.

978
00:53:45,256 --> 00:53:47,890
Me? Just give us a minute.

979
00:53:47,892 --> 00:53:49,425
Okay.

980
00:53:50,093 --> 00:53:52,161
One, two,

981
00:53:52,163 --> 00:53:54,663
Four...

982
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:01,203
Whoa.

983
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:07,509
Elsa?

984
00:54:07,944 --> 00:54:10,312
It's me, Anna.

985
00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:15,884
Anna.

986
00:54:18,788 --> 00:54:22,992
Whoa. Elsa, you look different.

987
00:54:22,994 --> 00:54:24,927
It's a good different.

988
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:26,662
And this place...

989
00:54:26,664 --> 00:54:28,264
It's amazing.

990
00:54:28,266 --> 00:54:29,098
Thank you.

991
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,267
I never knew
what I was capable of.

992
00:54:31,269 --> 00:54:34,970
I'm so sorry about what happened.
If I'd have known...

993
00:54:34,972 --> 00:54:35,671
No, no, no. It's okay.

994
00:54:35,673 --> 00:54:41,010
You don't have to apologize,
but you should probably go.

995
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:42,244
Please.

996
00:54:42,246 --> 00:54:43,846
But I just got here.

997
00:54:43,848 --> 00:54:46,415
You belong down in Arendelle.

998
00:54:46,417 --> 00:54:47,316
So do you.

999
00:54:47,318 --> 00:54:50,119
No, Anna, I belong here.

1000
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:51,654
Alone.

1001
00:54:51,656 --> 00:54:56,492
Where I can be who I am
without hurting anybody.

1002
00:54:56,494 --> 00:54:58,560
Actually, about that...

1003
00:54:58,562 --> 00:55:00,929
Sixty! Wait. What is that?

1004
00:55:00,931 --> 00:55:04,433
Hi! I'm Olaf
and I like warm hugs!

1005
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:06,302
Olaf?

1006
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:08,237
Yeah. You built me.

1007
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,005
Remember that?

1008
00:55:10,007 --> 00:55:11,240
And you're alive?

1009
00:55:11,242 --> 00:55:14,543
Um... I think so.

1010
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:18,080
He's just like the one
we built as kids.

1011
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:20,916
Yeah.

1012
00:55:20,918 --> 00:55:22,685
Elsa, we were so close.

1013
00:55:22,687 --> 00:55:25,454

No.

1017
00:55:36,233 --> 00:55:39,001
We can't. Goodbye, Anna.

1018
00:55:39,003 --> 00:55:39,668
Elsa, wait.

1019
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:41,603
No, I'm just trying
to protect you.

1020
00:55:41,605 --> 00:55:45,140
You don't have to protect me.
I'm not afraid.

1021

1076
00:58:02,313 --> 00:58:05,714
No, I know we can
figure this out together.

1077
00:58:05,716 --> 00:58:06,181
How?

1078
00:58:06,183 --> 00:58:09,351
What power do you have
to stop this winter?

1079
00:58:09,452 --> 00:58:10,385
To stop me?

1080
00:58:10,387 --> 00:58:11,787
Anna, I think we should go.

1081
00:58:11,789 --> 00:58:14,122
No, I'm not leaving
without you, Elsa.

1082
00:58:14,124 --> 00:58:16,225
Yes, you are.

1083
00:58:24,601 --> 00:58:26,001
Stop! Put us down!

1084
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:28,470
Go away.

1085
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:33,475
Heads up!

1086
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:34,977
Watch out for my butt!

1087
00:58:36,247 --> 00:58:38,981
It is not nice to throw people!

1088
00:58:38,983 --> 00:58:41,216
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
feisty-pants. Okay, relax.

1089
00:58:41,218 --> 00:58:43,652
Just calm down! Calm down!
Okay! All right!

1090
00:58:43,654 --> 00:58:45,621
I'm okay.
Just let the snowman be.

1091
00:58:45,623 --> 00:58:46,922
I'm calm. Great.

1092
00:58:46,924 --> 00:58:49,224
Oh! Come on!

1093
00:58:52,563 --> 00:58:54,062
Oh. Look, see?
Now, you made him mad.

1094
00:58:54,064 --> 00:58:56,732
I'll distract him. You guys go.

1095
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,268
No, no! Not you guys!

1096
00:58:59,802 --> 00:59:02,271
This just got
a whole lot harder.

1097
00:59:04,508 --> 00:59:06,141
Look out!

1098
00:59:18,289 --> 00:59:20,022
Run! Run!

1099
00:59:20,024 --> 00:59:22,024
What are you doing?

1100
00:59:25,663 --> 00:59:27,062
I got him!

1101
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:28,430
Whoa! Stop!

1102
00:59:28,432 --> 00:59:30,165
It's a 100-foot drop.

1103
00:59:30,167 --> 00:59:31,833
It's 200.

1104
00:59:31,835 --> 00:59:33,001
Ow!

1105
00:59:33,003 --> 00:59:35,704
What's that for?
I'm digging a snow anchor.

1106
00:59:35,706 --> 00:59:37,506
Okay. What if we fall?

1107
00:59:37,508 --> 00:59:39,141
There's 20 feet of fresh
powder down there.

1108
00:59:39,143 --> 00:59:41,443
It'll be like landing
on a pillow.

1109
00:59:41,445 --> 00:59:43,078
Hopefully.

1110
00:59:45,783 --> 00:59:47,616
Okay, Anna. On three.

1111
00:59:47,618 --> 00:59:48,717
Okay. One...

1112
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:49,885
You tell me when.
I'm ready to go.

1113
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:51,853
Two... I was born ready! Yes!

1114
00:59:51,855 --> 00:59:53,488
Calm down.

1115
00:59:55,926 --> 00:59:57,326
Tree!

1116
00:59:57,328 --> 00:59:58,660
What the... Whoa!

1117
00:59:58,662 --> 01:00:01,530
That happened.

1118
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:05,267
Man, am I out of shape.

1119
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:11,506
There we go. Hey, Anna!

1120
01:00:11,508 --> 01:00:13,442
Sven! Where did you guys go?

1121
01:00:13,444 --> 01:00:16,345
We totally lost
Marshmallow back there.

1122
01:00:16,347 --> 01:00:19,381
Hey! We were just
talking about you.

1123
01:00:19,383 --> 01:00:22,117
All good things,
all good things.

1124
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:23,952
No!

1125
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:29,725
This is not making much
of a difference, is it?

1126
01:00:31,428 --> 01:00:32,127
Olaf!

1127
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:34,496
Hang in there, guys!

1128
01:00:34,498 --> 01:00:35,631
Go. Go faster!

1129
01:00:37,433 --> 01:00:39,768
Hey!

1130
01:00:43,573 --> 01:00:45,273
Ow!

1131
01:00:45,275 --> 01:00:46,708
Kristoff!

1132
01:00:48,045 --> 01:00:50,779
Don't come back!

1133
01:00:51,014 --> 01:00:52,280
We won't.

1134
01:00:59,456 --> 01:01:03,058
Hey, you were right.
Just like a pillow.

1135
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:04,226
Olaf!

1136
01:01:04,228 --> 01:01:07,663
I can't feel my legs!
I can't feel my legs!

1137
01:01:09,066 --> 01:01:10,465
Those are my legs. Ooh!

1138
01:01:10,467 --> 01:01:12,634
Hey, do me a favor,
grab my butt.

1139
01:01:12,636 --> 01:01:14,870
Oh. That feels better.

1140
01:01:14,872 --> 01:01:17,239
Hey, Sven! He found us.

1141
01:01:17,241 --> 01:01:19,274
Who's my cute little reindeer?

1142
01:01:19,276 --> 01:01:21,677
Don't talk to him like that.

1143
01:01:21,679 --> 01:01:24,146
You're tickling me.

1144
01:01:24,814 --> 01:01:26,248
Here.

1145
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:27,182
Whoa!

1146
01:01:27,184 --> 01:01:28,617
Are you okay?

1147
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:30,318
Thank you.

1148
01:01:30,486 --> 01:01:32,187
How's your head? Ah! Ooh!

1149
01:01:33,824 --> 01:01:34,589
It's fine. Uh...

1150
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:36,591
Uh, I'm good.
I've got a thick skull.

1151
01:01:36,593 --> 01:01:38,493
I don't have a skull.

1152
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:40,462
Or bones.

1153
01:01:40,464 --> 01:01:43,465
So, uh... So, now what?

1154
01:01:43,467 --> 01:01:45,600
Now what?

1155
01:01:45,602 --> 01:01:47,069
Now what?

1156
01:01:47,071 --> 01:01:48,203
Oh...

1157
01:01:48,205 --> 01:01:50,005
What am I gonna do?

1158
01:01:50,106 --> 01:01:50,672
She threw me out.

1159
01:01:50,674 --> 01:01:53,408
I can't go back to Arendelle
with the weather like this.

1160
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:54,443
And then there's
your ice business.

1161
01:01:54,445 --> 01:01:57,979
Hey, hey. Don't worry
about my ice business.

1162
01:01:58,448 --> 01:01:59,581
Worry about your hair!

1163
01:01:59,583 --> 01:02:01,683
What? I just fell off a cliff.
You should see your hair.

1164
01:02:01,685 --> 01:02:03,919
No, yours is turning white.

1165
01:02:03,921 --> 01:02:06,254
White? It's... What?

1166
01:02:06,256 --> 01:02:09,391
It's because she struck you,
isn't it?

1167
01:02:09,393 --> 01:02:11,660
Does it look bad?

1168
01:02:12,128 --> 01:02:13,762
No. You hesitated.

1169
01:02:13,764 --> 01:02:14,362
No, I didn't.

1170
01:02:14,364 --> 01:02:17,032
Anna, you need help, okay?
Come on.

1171
01:02:17,034 --> 01:02:18,767
Okay! Where are we going?

1172
01:02:18,769 --> 01:02:20,035
To see my friends.

1173
01:02:20,037 --> 01:02:21,103
The love experts?

1174
01:02:21,105 --> 01:02:22,671
Love experts? Uh-huh.

1175
01:02:22,673 --> 01:02:25,874
And don't worry,
they'll be able to fix this.

1176
01:02:25,876 --> 01:02:27,843
How do you know?

1177
01:02:27,845 --> 01:02:30,712
Because I've seen them
do it before.

1178
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:33,782
I like to consider myself
a love expert.

1179
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:40,489
Get it together.

1180
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,057
Control it.

1181
01:02:42,059 --> 01:02:44,292
Don't feel. Don't feel.

1182
01:02:44,294 --> 01:02:46,128
Don't feel.

1183
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:48,630
Don't feel!

1184
01:03:02,145 --> 01:03:05,347
Look, Sven, the sky is awake.

1185
01:03:07,651 --> 01:03:10,552
Are you cold? A little.

1186
01:03:12,155 --> 01:03:14,723
Uh... Wait. Come here.

1187
01:03:14,725 --> 01:03:16,191
Huh?

1188
01:03:16,259 --> 01:03:18,193
Ooh.

1189
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:22,397
So, uh, about my friends.
Well...

1190
01:03:22,399 --> 01:03:23,865
I say "friends"...

1191
01:03:23,867 --> 01:03:25,433
They're more like family.

1192
01:03:25,435 --> 01:03:28,470
Anyway, when I was a kid,
it was just me and Sven.

1193
01:03:28,472 --> 01:03:31,239
Until they, you know,
kinda took us in.

1194
01:03:31,241 --> 01:03:33,041
They did? Yeah.

1195
01:03:33,043 --> 01:03:33,809
I don't want to scare you.

1196
01:03:33,811 --> 01:03:38,580
They can be a little
inappropriate and loud.

1197
01:03:38,582 --> 01:03:39,981
Very loud.

1198
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:42,150
They are also stubborn
at times,

1199
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:43,185
and a little overbearing.

1200
01:03:43,187 --> 01:03:45,720
And heavy.
Really, really, heavy.

1201
01:03:45,722 --> 01:03:48,223
But you'll get it.
They mean well.

1202
01:03:48,225 --> 01:03:51,393
Kristoff, they sound wonderful.

1203
01:03:52,929 --> 01:03:54,863
Okay, then.

1204
01:03:54,865 --> 01:03:57,465
Meet my family.

1205
01:03:58,167 --> 01:03:59,401
Hey, guys.

1206
01:03:59,403 --> 01:04:00,602
They're rocks.

1207
01:04:00,604 --> 01:04:03,338
You are a sight for sore eyes.

1208
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:06,408
He's crazy.

1209
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:08,343
Rocko's looking sharp,
as usual.

1210
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:11,513
Clay, whoa...
I don't even recognize you.

1211
01:04:11,515 --> 01:04:12,247
You lost so much weight.

1212
01:04:12,249 --> 01:04:14,950
I'll distract
him while you run.

1213
01:04:14,952 --> 01:04:17,719
Hi, Sven's family!

1214
01:04:17,721 --> 01:04:19,788
It's nice to meet you.

1215
01:04:19,790 --> 01:04:22,190
Because I love you,
Anna, I insist you run.

1216
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:26,995
I understand
you're love experts. Ooh!

1217
01:04:26,997 --> 01:04:29,331
Why aren't you running?

1218
01:04:29,333 --> 01:04:30,332
Uh...

1219
01:04:30,334 --> 01:04:32,634
Okay. Well, I'm gonna go.

1220
01:04:32,636 --> 01:04:35,103
Go. No, no, no. Anna, wait.

1221
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:38,840
Kristoff!

1222
01:04:38,842 --> 01:04:41,409
Whoa!

1223
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:43,111
Hey!

1224
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:45,080
Kristoff's home!

1225
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:48,116
Kristoff's here!

1226
01:04:48,118 --> 01:04:49,251
Kristoff's home!

1227
01:04:49,253 --> 01:04:51,820
Wait, "Kristoff"? Uh-huh.

1228
01:04:51,822 --> 01:04:53,021
Ah, let me look at you.

1229
01:04:53,023 --> 01:04:54,589
Take off your clothes,
I wash them.

1230
01:04:54,591 --> 01:04:56,491
No! No, I'm going
to keep my clothes on.

1231
01:04:56,493 --> 01:04:58,293
Look, it's great
to see you all,

1232
01:04:58,295 --> 01:04:59,594
but where's Granpabbie?

1233
01:04:59,596 --> 01:05:00,495
He's napping.

1234
01:05:00,497 --> 01:05:02,197
But look, I grew a mushroom.

1235
01:05:02,199 --> 01:05:04,132
I... I earned my fire crystal.

1236
01:05:04,134 --> 01:05:04,966
I passed a kidney stone.

1237
01:05:04,968 --> 01:05:08,203
Kristoff, pick me up.
You're getting big.

1238
01:05:08,205 --> 01:05:09,905
Good for you.

1239
01:05:09,907 --> 01:05:12,540
Trolls. They're trolls!

1240
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:17,012
He's brought a girl!

1241
01:05:17,014 --> 01:05:18,213
A girl!

1242
01:05:18,215 --> 01:05:19,881
Is that a real girl?

1243
01:05:19,883 --> 01:05:22,517
She's like a little cupcake.

1244
01:05:22,519 --> 01:05:23,151
What's going on?

1245
01:05:23,153 --> 01:05:24,219
I've learned
to just roll with it.

1246
01:05:24,221 --> 01:05:27,188
Let me see.
Bright eyes, working nose,

1247
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:28,223
strong teeth!

1248
01:05:28,225 --> 01:05:31,259
Yes, yes. She'll do
nicely for our Kristoff.

1249
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:32,694
Wait, wait, wait. Oh, um, no.

1250
01:05:32,696 --> 01:05:34,062
No. You've got the wrong idea.

1251
01:05:34,064 --> 01:05:35,163
No. That's not why
I brought her here.

1252
01:05:35,165 --> 01:05:37,532
Right. We're not... I'm not...

Why did you bring me here?

I can't.

1388
01:13:14,724 --> 01:13:18,226
You have to tell them
to let me go.

1389
01:13:19,361 --> 01:13:21,863
I will do what I can.

1390

You cannot risk going
out there again.

1409

If anything happens to her...

1410

What happened out there?

1420
01:15:20,183 --> 01:15:22,350
Elsa struck me with her powers.

1421
01:15:22,352 --> 01:15:24,385
You said she would
never hurt you.

1422
01:15:24,387 --> 01:15:25,453

She froze my heart,

1425
01:15:30,793 --> 01:15:34,328
and only an act
of true love can save me.

1426
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:37,798
A true love's kiss.

1427
01:15:47,442 --> 01:15:49,043
Oh, Anna.

1428
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:53,214
If only there was someone
out there who loved you.

1429
01:15:53,282 --> 01:15:54,949
What?

1430
01:15:57,986 --> 01:16:00,254
You said you did.

1431
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:02,089
As thirteenth in line

1432
01:16:02,091 --> 01:16:03,691
in my own kingdom,

1433
01:16:03,693 --> 01:16:04,659
I didn't stand a chance.

1434
01:16:04,661 --> 01:16:07,695
I knew I would have
to marry into

1435
01:16:07,697 --> 01:16:08,396
the throne somewhere.

1436
01:16:08,398 --> 01:16:10,364
What... What are
you talking about?

1437
01:16:10,366 --> 01:16:13,067
As heir, Elsa was
preferable, of course.

1438
01:16:13,069 --> 01:16:15,236
But no one was getting
anywhere with her.

1439
01:16:15,238 --> 01:16:16,037
But you... Hans!

1440
01:16:16,039 --> 01:16:17,605
You were so desperate for love,

1441
01:16:17,607 --> 01:16:21,342
you were willing
to marry me just like that.

1442
01:16:21,944 --> 01:16:23,277
I figured after we married,

1443
01:16:23,279 --> 01:16:25,880
I would have to stage
a little accident for Elsa.

1444
01:16:25,882 --> 01:16:28,516
Hans! No. Stop.

1445
01:16:28,518 --> 01:16:30,017
But then, she doomed herself,

1446
01:16:30,019 --> 01:16:32,453
and you were dumb enough
to go after her.

1447
01:16:32,455 --> 01:16:33,554
Please.

1448
01:16:33,556 --> 01:16:36,891
All that's left now
is to kill Elsa,

1449
01:16:36,959 --> 01:16:38,859
and bring back summer.

1450
01:16:38,861 --> 01:16:40,828
You're no match for Elsa.

1451
01:16:40,830 --> 01:16:43,798
No, you're no match for Elsa.

1452
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:45,066
I, on the other hand,

1453
01:16:45,068 --> 01:16:50,671
am the hero who is going to save
Arendelle from destruction.

1454
01:16:50,806 --> 01:16:52,974
You won't get away with this.

1455
01:16:53,175 --> 01:16:54,575
Oh...

1456
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:56,777
I already have.

1457
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:04,285
Please, somebody, help.

1458
01:17:07,723 --> 01:17:10,091
Please. Please.

1459
01:17:12,261 --> 01:17:13,828
It's getting colder
by the minute.

1460
01:17:13,830 --> 01:17:17,698
If we don't do something soon,
we'll all freeze to death.

1461
01:17:18,367 --> 01:17:19,834
Prince Hans.

1462
01:17:19,836 --> 01:17:22,403
Princess Anna is...

1463
01:17:22,871 --> 01:17:23,371
Dead.

1464
01:17:23,373 --> 01:17:24,772
What?

1465
01:17:24,774 --> 01:17:26,974
What happened to her?

1466
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:33,414
She was killed.

1467
01:17:33,416 --> 01:17:34,682
By Queen Elsa.

1468
01:17:34,684 --> 01:17:36,117
No!

1469
01:17:36,119 --> 01:17:37,585
Her own sister.

1470
01:17:37,587 --> 01:17:40,588
At least we got to say
our marriage vows

1471
01:17:42,290 --> 01:17:45,259
before she died in my arms.

1472
01:17:46,294 --> 01:17:48,329
There can be no doubt now.

1473
01:17:48,331 --> 01:17:49,664
Queen Elsa is a monster,

1474
01:17:49,666 --> 01:17:52,099
and we are all in grave danger.

1475
01:17:52,101 --> 01:17:53,901
Prince Hans,

1476
01:17:53,903 --> 01:17:56,470
Arendelle looks to you.

1477
01:17:57,472 --> 01:17:58,439
With a heavy heart,

1478
01:17:58,441 --> 01:18:03,844
I charge Queen Elsa
of Arendelle with treason.

1479
01:18:04,046 --> 01:18:06,914
And sentence her to death.

1480
01:18:18,427 --> 01:18:20,094
Hurry up!

1481
01:18:20,096 --> 01:18:20,828
She's dangerous.

1482
01:18:20,830 --> 01:18:22,663
Careful.

1483
01:18:23,533 --> 01:18:25,533
- It won't open!
- It's frozen shut.

1484
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:27,201
Put your back into it!

1485
01:18:27,203 --> 01:18:28,869
Come on! Push!

1486
01:18:55,064 --> 01:18:56,230
What is it, buddy?

1487
01:18:56,232 --> 01:18:58,099
Hey, watch it.

1488
01:18:58,101 --> 01:18:59,533
What's wrong with you?

1489
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:04,972
I don't understand you
when you talk like that.

1490
01:19:04,974 --> 01:19:07,842
Stop it! Put me down!

1491
01:19:09,911 --> 01:19:10,811
No, Sven!

1492
01:19:10,813 --> 01:19:12,646
We're not going back.

1493
01:19:12,648 --> 01:19:14,882
She's with her true love.

1494
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:23,124
What the...

1495
01:19:25,427 --> 01:19:26,961
Anna!

1496
01:19:32,501 --> 01:19:34,635
Come on! Come on, boy.

1497
01:19:52,487 --> 01:19:54,121
Help.

1498
01:19:58,593 --> 01:20:00,494
Anna!

1499
01:20:01,029 --> 01:20:02,630
Oh, no.

1500
01:20:14,243 --> 01:20:15,743
Olaf?

1501
01:20:15,745 --> 01:20:18,445
Olaf. Get away from there.

1502
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:20,047
Wow!

1503
01:20:20,049 --> 01:20:22,483
So, this is heat.

1504
01:20:22,485 --> 01:20:23,818
I love it.

1505
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:26,153
Ooh! But don't touch it.

1506
01:20:33,461 --> 01:20:36,831
So, where's Hans?
What happened to your kiss?

1507
01:20:36,833 --> 01:20:41,235
I was wrong about him.
It wasn't true love.

1508
01:20:41,237 --> 01:20:42,703
But we ran all the way here.

1509
01:20:42,705 --> 01:20:46,340
Please, Olaf, you can't
stay here. You'll melt.

1510
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:47,508
I am not leaving here until

1511
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:50,444
we find some other act
of true love to save you.

1512
01:20:50,579 --> 01:20:52,646
Do you happen to have
any ideas?

1513
01:20:52,648 --> 01:20:55,216
I don't even know what love is.

1514
01:20:55,218 --> 01:20:57,451
That's okay, I do.

1515
01:20:57,552 --> 01:20:59,119
Love is

1516
01:20:59,121 --> 01:21:01,388
putting someone else's
needs before yours.

1517
01:21:01,390 --> 01:21:07,161
Like, you know, how Kristoff brought you
back here to Hans and left you forever.

1518
01:21:08,730 --> 01:21:12,499
Kristoff loves me?

1519
01:21:12,767 --> 01:21:17,571
Wow, you really don't know
anything about love, do you?

1520
01:21:17,639 --> 01:21:19,240
Olaf, you're melting.

1521
01:21:19,242 --> 01:21:22,376
Some people are
worth melting for.

1522
01:21:26,382 --> 01:21:29,149
Just maybe not right
this second.

1523
01:21:31,187 --> 01:21:33,254
Don't worry, I've got it.

1524
01:21:35,091 --> 01:21:37,291
We're gonna get through...
Oh, wait.

1525
01:21:37,293 --> 01:21:39,627
Hang on, I'm getting something.

1526
01:21:39,694 --> 01:21:42,463
It's Kristoff and Sven!

1527
01:21:42,465 --> 01:21:44,531
They're coming back this way.

1528
01:21:44,633 --> 01:21:45,532
They... They are?

1529
01:21:45,534 --> 01:21:48,769
Wow! He's really moving fast.

1530
01:21:48,771 --> 01:21:49,503
I guess I was wrong.

1531
01:21:49,505 --> 01:21:53,207
I guess Kristoff doesn't love
you enough to leave you behind.

1532
01:21:53,209 --> 01:21:54,541
Help me up, Olaf. Please.

1533
01:21:54,543 --> 01:21:58,445
No, no, no! You need to stay
by the fire and keep warm.

1534
01:21:58,447 --> 01:22:00,648
I need to get to Kristoff.

1535
01:22:00,650 --> 01:22:01,649
Why?

1536
01:22:01,651 --> 01:22:04,018
Oh, I know why!

1537
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:05,352
There's your act
of true love right there!

1538
01:22:05,354 --> 01:22:11,025
Riding across the fjords like a
valiant, pungent reindeer king!

1539
01:22:11,027 --> 01:22:12,426
Come on!

1540
01:22:14,562 --> 01:22:16,130
Look out!

1541
01:22:16,132 --> 01:22:17,932
Oh!

1542
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:26,974
Uh... Back this way.

1543
01:22:26,976 --> 01:22:29,209
We're trapped.

1544
01:22:41,057 --> 01:22:42,957
Oh...

1545
01:22:46,395 --> 01:22:48,395
Whoa!

1546
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:53,100
Slide, Anna!

1547
01:23:01,744 --> 01:23:03,510
We made it!

1548
01:23:03,578 --> 01:23:06,280
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

1549
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:20,527
Come on, buddy, faster.

1550
01:23:22,531 --> 01:23:24,365
Kristoff!

1551
01:23:29,637 --> 01:23:31,605
Keep going!

1552
01:23:33,708 --> 01:23:35,409
Kristoff!

1553
01:23:46,955 --> 01:23:48,522
Come on!

1554
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:03,537
No.

1555
01:24:18,586 --> 01:24:20,120
Whoa!

1556
01:24:26,795 --> 01:24:29,029
Whoa!

1557
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:31,965
Sven... Sven!

1558
01:24:42,110 --> 01:24:43,911
Good boy.

1559
01:24:54,722 --> 01:24:56,723
Kristoff.

1560
01:24:57,058 --> 01:24:59,560
Kristoff... Anna...

1561
01:25:00,028 --> 01:25:01,562
Anna!

1562
01:25:04,233 --> 01:25:08,302
Elsa! You can't run from this!

1563
01:25:09,971 --> 01:25:12,272
Just take care of my sister.

1564
01:25:12,274 --> 01:25:13,307
Your sister?

1565
01:25:13,309 --> 01:25:16,310
She returned from the mountain
weak and cold.

1566
01:25:16,312 --> 01:25:18,946
She said that
you froze her heart.

1567
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:19,646
No.

1568
01:25:19,648 --> 01:25:22,616
I tried to save her,
but it was too late.

1569
01:25:22,917 --> 01:25:26,420
Her skin was ice.
Her hair turned white.

1570
01:25:27,288 --> 01:25:29,556
Your sister is dead.

1571
01:25:29,858 --> 01:25:31,692
Because of you.

1572
01:25:31,694 --> 01:25:33,193
No.

1573
01:25:55,316 --> 01:25:56,850
Kristoff.

1574
01:25:56,852 --> 01:25:59,386
Anna!

1575
01:26:11,566 --> 01:26:13,367
Elsa?

1576
01:26:21,376 --> 01:26:22,743
No!

1577
01:26:34,722 --> 01:26:36,356
Anna!

1578
01:26:36,791 --> 01:26:38,825
Oh. Anna!

1579
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:41,428
No, no!

1580
01:26:41,430 --> 01:26:43,397
Please, no.

1581
01:26:51,639 --> 01:26:52,673
Anna?

1582
01:27:32,982 --> 01:27:35,182
Anna?

1583
01:27:38,153 --> 01:27:39,152
Oh, Elsa.

1584
01:27:39,154 --> 01:27:42,389
You sacrificed yourself for me?

1585
01:27:43,591 --> 01:27:44,258
I love you.

1586
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:50,397
"An act of true love
will thaw a frozen heart."

1587
01:27:51,299 --> 01:27:53,634
"Love will thaw."

1588
01:27:54,535 --> 01:27:57,170
Love. Of course.

1589
01:27:57,172 --> 01:27:58,705
Elsa?

1590
01:27:59,007 --> 01:28:00,407
Love!

1591
01:28:46,654 --> 01:28:47,654
I knew you could do it.

1592
01:28:47,656 --> 01:28:51,792
Hands down, this is
the best day of my life.

1593
01:28:51,794 --> 01:28:54,027
And, quite possibly, the last.

1594
01:28:54,029 --> 01:28:57,164
Oh, Olaf! Hang on, little guy.

1595
01:28:57,166 --> 01:28:59,199
Oh, oh, oh!

1596
01:29:00,502 --> 01:29:04,271
My own personal flurry!

1597
01:29:08,576 --> 01:29:10,711
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

1598
01:29:13,648 --> 01:29:14,381
Anna?

1599
01:29:14,383 --> 01:29:15,982
But she froze your heart.

1600
01:29:15,984 --> 01:29:19,720
The only frozen heart
around here is yours.

1601
01:29:23,892 --> 01:29:26,693
Wonderful!

1602
01:29:38,973 --> 01:29:41,174
Setting course, sir.

1603
01:29:43,211 --> 01:29:45,512
I will return this scoundrel
to his country.

1604
01:29:45,514 --> 01:29:50,217
We shall see what his 12 big
brothers think of his behavior.

1605
01:29:50,219 --> 01:29:51,918
Arendelle thanks you, milord.

1606
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:53,286
This is unacceptable.

1607
01:29:53,288 --> 01:29:57,057
I am a victim of fear.
I've been traumatized.

1608
01:29:57,059 --> 01:29:58,759
Ah! My neck hurts.

1609
01:29:58,761 --> 01:30:02,162
Is there a doctor that
I could see?

1610
01:30:02,164 --> 01:30:04,331
And I demand to see the queen!

1611
01:30:04,333 --> 01:30:07,200
Oh. I have a message
from the queen.

1612
01:30:07,202 --> 01:30:08,668
"Arendelle will
henceforth and forever"

1613
01:30:08,670 --> 01:30:13,707
"no longer do business
of any sort with Weaseltown."

1614
01:30:13,709 --> 01:30:14,341
"Weselton."

1615
01:30:14,343 --> 01:30:15,909
- It's Weselton!
- Let's go.

1616
01:30:15,911 --> 01:30:18,578
Come on, come on, come on!

1617
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:19,713
Okay, okay, here I come.

1618
01:30:19,715 --> 01:30:22,215
Pole! Whoops! Sorry.

1619
01:30:22,217 --> 01:30:23,884
Okay, okay.

1620
01:30:23,886 --> 01:30:25,786
Here we are. Oh!

1621
01:30:27,755 --> 01:30:30,323
I owe you a sled.

1622
01:30:32,660 --> 01:30:34,661
Are you serious? Yes!

1623
01:30:34,663 --> 01:30:36,363
And it's the latest model.

1624
01:30:36,365 --> 01:30:37,464
No, I can't accept this.

1625
01:30:37,466 --> 01:30:40,066
You have to. No returns.
No exchanges. Queen's orders.

1626
01:30:40,068 --> 01:30:44,704
She's named you the Official
Arendelle Ice Master and Deliverer.

1627
01:30:44,706 --> 01:30:46,406
What? That's not a thing.
Oh, sure it is.

1628
01:30:46,408 --> 01:30:50,477
And it even has a cup holder.
Do you like it?

1629
01:30:50,479 --> 01:30:52,679
Like it? I love it!

1630
01:30:52,681 --> 01:30:53,980
Whoa.

1631
01:30:53,982 --> 01:30:56,283
I could kiss you!

1632
01:30:56,285 --> 01:30:57,685
I could. I mean,
I'd like to. I'd...

1633
01:30:57,686 --> 01:31:00,854
May I? We me. I mean, may we?

1634
01:31:00,856 --> 01:31:02,289
Wait, what?

1635
01:31:02,790 --> 01:31:04,524
We may.

1636
01:31:05,626 --> 01:31:07,828
Mmm.

1637
01:31:08,196 --> 01:31:09,763
Summer!

1638
01:31:11,099 --> 01:31:13,467
Ooh...

1639
01:31:13,469 --> 01:31:15,669
Hello.

1640
01:31:31,819 --> 01:31:32,919
Are you ready?

1641
01:31:38,025 --> 01:31:40,627
Ice!

1642
01:31:51,305 --> 01:31:52,973
Ooh! Whoo-hoo...

1643
01:31:52,975 --> 01:31:55,075
Swing me.

1644
01:31:55,543 --> 01:31:57,544
Ooh...

1645
01:31:57,546 --> 01:31:58,712
I like the open gates.

1646
01:31:58,714 --> 01:32:01,515
We are never
closing them again.

1647
01:32:03,785 --> 01:32:06,586
Oh, Elsa, they're beautiful,
but you know I don't skate.

1648
01:32:06,588 --> 01:32:07,954
Come on! You can do it!

1649
01:32:07,956 --> 01:32:09,990
Look out.
Reindeer coming through.

1650
01:32:09,992 --> 01:32:12,692
I got it, I got it. I don't
got it, I don't got it.

1651
01:32:12,694 --> 01:32:13,326
Hey, guys!

1652
01:32:13,328 --> 01:32:14,561
That's it, Olaf.

1653
01:32:14,563 --> 01:32:18,298
Glide and pivot.
And glide and pivot.

1654
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:20,133
Go.

1655
01:41:43,864 --> 01:41:45,364
Oh!
