1
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,755
So, the Aldridge Mansion is the only
19th century home in New York City

2
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,269
preserved both inside and out.

3
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,998
At the time of its construction,

4
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,315
it was one of the most
elegant homes in existence.

5
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,548
Um, interesting fact.
This grandfather clock was on the Titanic

6
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,710
and was saved by Sir Aldridge.

7
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,240
A Romanian woman and her child were
forced to leave the lifeboat to make room.

8
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,197
Uh, over here,

9
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,598
you can imagine Sir Aldridge
entertaining his wealthy guests.

10
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,800
It's said that, in this very room, P.T. Barnum
first had the idea to enslave elephants.

11
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,198
And if you'll follow me...

12
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,031
Now, I'm gonna tell you
something a little spooky.

13
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,793
On the morning of October 25th, 1894,
Sir Aldridge awoke, furious,

14
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,836
when his breakfast was not waiting for him.

15
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,754
So he called to his servants,
but none of them responded.

16
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,634
Why?

17
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,839
Because, during the night, one by one,

18
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,356
they had each been stabbed to death
in their sleep.

19
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,319
It was later discovered

20
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,109
they were murdered by his eldest daughter,

21
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,191
Gertrude Aldridge.

22
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,236
Sir Aldridge once wrote in his diary,

23
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,197
"I know God makes no mistakes,

24
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,876
"but I believe he may have been drunk
when he built Gertrude's personality."

25
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,713
Now, to spare the family
public humiliation,

26
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,950
instead of turning her in to the police,

27
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,670
they locked her in this basement.

28
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,633
And they fed her...

29
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,713
...through this slot.

30
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,475
Years later, when a new owner moved in,

31
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,710
they dug out her remains.

32
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,913
But, after repeatedly
hearing strange sounds,

33
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,032
he sealed it shut.

34
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,312
That's right.
No one has opened this door since then.

35
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,519
Okay.

36
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,715
Follow me.

37
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,671
Maybe steer clear of the door.

38
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,389
Sorry, Sir Aldridge.
I got to get out of here!

39
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,159
Oh, Garret, you idiot.

40
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,914
No.

41
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,072
No.

42
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,870
No! No! No!

43
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,193
No! No!

44
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,272
No!

45
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,238
Daniel. Teresa.

46
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,836
Dr. Roberts. Robert, hello.

47
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,230
- Erin, sweetheart. Hi.
- Hello, Phil.

48
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,072
- Good morning, Jack.
- Hi.

49
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,749
- Did you hear the news?
- Tell me.

50
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,115
I'm lecturing in the big hall today.

51
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,310
- Darling, that's wonderful.
- I know.

52
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,472
- This is what you're wearing?
- What?

53
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,835
I have someone I want you to meet.

54
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,196
Phyllis, I would like to
introduce Erin Gilbert.

55
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,556
She specializes in
theoretical particle physics.

56
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,517
I'm a huge fan.

57
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,192
This is such an honor to meet you.

58
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,955
Phyllis is guest lecturing
in Daniels' astrophysics and cosmology.

59
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,120
Wow.

60
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,118
Erin just learned she's being published.

61
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,596
Yes, well, I'm very proud.

62
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,433
I don't allow my lab
to submit to journals anymore.

63
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,071
I think journals tamper with the process
and ultimately hurt scientific research.

64
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,836
Yeah. It's like when scientists get caught up,
you know, in those dumb awards.

65
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,559
- You know...
- Oh, awards are massively important.

66
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,393
Yes, no, I was saying
it'd be dumb not to go after awards,

67
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,550
'cause that's where science really shines.

68
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,758
It's, unfortunately, the only way
to draw attention to good science.

69
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,319
- Excellent point.
- Mmm-hmm.

70
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,591
All right. I should be going.

71
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,680
Hey, Simon.

72
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,993
Well, I'm going to lecture right now

73
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,988
in the big hall.

74
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,119
It's good that it's big, too, 'cause I've got
a lot of big ideas I'm going to be spreading.

75
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,510
Hey, good luck on your tenure review.
Make me proud.

76
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,189
Fingers crossed.

77
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,874
Not that crossing your fingers
means anything, 'cause it doesn't.

78
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,837
Oh, I couldn't disagree more.

79
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:10,357
It's been proven that superstitions
can have tremendous performance benefits.

80
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,752
Exactly. I'm wrong about everything.

81
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,120
All right. Well, I'm gonna try to get out
of here without stepping on these cracks.

82
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,839
I don't want my mom calling me, like...

83
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,960
Oh, see, when they change direction,
you've got to...

84
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,952
So, you know her?

85
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,951
Oh! Ding dong.

86
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,040
Yeah.

87
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,516
Sean, that is an excellent question.

88
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,955
As you can see from my calculations,

89
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:39,353
we will soon be able to combine
general relativity and quantum theory.

90
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,238
Teaching in the big hall. Big day.

91
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,358
Big hall. Big hall. Big hall!

92
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,995
Big hall!

93
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,152
Sorry to interrupt, but I need to speak
to you about something you wrote.

94
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,240
Um...

95
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,395
I'm sorry. Uh, yes. What, um...

96
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,835
What publication?

97
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,228
I'm talking about your book.

98
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,760
Mmm...

99
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,029
Book. Um...

100
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,391
I'm sorry, I don't know what you mean.

101
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,536
Now, if you'll excuse me,
my class will be here any minute.

102
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,993
You're Erin Gilbert, right?

103
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,480
Co-author of Ghosts from Our Past:

104
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,154
Both Literally and Figuratively:
The Study of the Paranormal?

105
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,638
I think you're looking for
a different Erin Gilbert.

106
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,314
One that likes very long titles.

107
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,439
Okay. But this really does look like you.

108
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,719
What? No.

109
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,148
Yeah, that's me.

110
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,799
Look, it was a very long time ago,

111
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,075
and it was just a gag
between a couple of friends.

112
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,474
I'm sorry.

113
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,516
A 460-page gag?

114
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,919
The first sentence is,
"This is not a joke."

115
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,355
What do you want?

116
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,668
Well, I'm Ed Mulgrave.

117
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,957
I'm the historian at the Aldridge Mansion,
and I believe it's haunted.

118
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,633
If you could just come take a look.

119
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,553
I tried the police, but I just sound crazy.

120
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,871
I'm sorry.
That book you're holding is utter nonsense.

121
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,875
I don't even know how you got that.
I thought I burned both copies.

122
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,951
It's on Amazon. Both hard copy and e-book.

123
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,515
- What?
- It's on Books on Tape, too.

124
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,033
Only, I know how to read.

125
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,635
Is it now?

126
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,475
No!

127
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,597
No, no, no, no, no. I'm gonna kill you, Abby.

128
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,040
- Oh.
- Erin.

129
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,315
Hi! Oh, Dr. Filmore. Hello, hi.

130
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,631
We're set for the final review
of your tenure case on Thursday.

131
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,195
Great.

132
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,874
But I saw that you had
a recommendation letter

133
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,752
from Dr. Branum at Princeton.

134
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,976
- Uh...
- Their science department

135
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,070
is really not what it used to be.

136
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,358
And I would consider getting a referral
from a more prestigious college.

137
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,237
More prestigious than Princeton?

138
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,720
Yes.

139
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,313
Um, hmm.

140
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,038
You see, I think you're an asset
to modern physics,

141
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,152
but I would hate to see you
throw it down the drain.

142
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,670
No. No, no, no, sir.
I won't throw it down the drain.

143
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,398
And I will get on that letter.

144
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,429
Yes. Princeton. More like Prince-tons
of dummies go there.

145
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,593
About your clothes...

146
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,432
Yes? Did you...

147
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,520
Uh...

148
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,118
Too sexy for academia?

149
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,629
Never mind.

150
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,828
No, no, no. What is it?

151
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,992
- Never mind!
- I don't...

152
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,472
Abby. You promised you wouldn't do this.

153
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,628
"Abigail continues her passion
for the study of the paranormal

154
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,235
"at the Kenneth P. Higgins
Institute of Science."

155
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,753
Come on, F7!

156
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,360
Are you kidding me?

157
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,720
Hello?

158
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,631
I've been waiting a long time.

159
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,078
Has been a while, hasn't it?

160
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,194
Hope you brought me more than one wonton.

161
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,275
Excuse me? Oh.

162
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,640
Huh.

163
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,477
Well, well, well.

164
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,120
Erin.

165
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,714
Abby.

166
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,595
Bennie.

167
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,433
Yes, I know who you are, Bennie.
Can I just...

168
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,911
Can I have my lunch
that I've been waiting an hour for?

169
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,956
You know they make
smaller headphones now, right?

170
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,593
It's an advance in science.

171
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,399
Thank you for asking.

172
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,357
Probably the future you're looking at.

173
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,560
Here you go.

174
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,200
Why don't you show Miss
Gilbert to the door.

175
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,077
Oh, it's just the same
door we came in from.

176
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,936
- Yeah, I know how to get out. It's figurative.
- It's really not that hard.

177
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,439
- No, I'm okay.
- Don't.

178
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,393
- I tried.
- Poorly.

179
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,633
You put our book online
without my permission.

180
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,399
I don't need your permission.

181
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,816
Of course you need my permission.
I wrote that book with you.

182
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,034
My name is on it.

183
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,236
No. Absolutely not.

184
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,749
That book is a whole new
revenue stream for me.

185
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,752
And I'm, like, one-tenth away from
getting a new mini fridge in here.

186
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,273
Look, I am up for tenure right now.

187
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,120
Ooh, "I'm up for tenure."

188
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,714
And if my colleagues at Columbia University
google my name,

189
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,597
that is the first thing that comes up.

190
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,989
Along with a ghost emoji now,
thank you very much,

191
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,216
- that does a little dance.
- You know what?

192
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,037
That book was our baby.

193
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,635
And you abandoned that baby
before it even learned to fly!

194
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,598
Okay, well, books can't fly.
And neither can babies, so...

195
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,318
You don't know. I'll tell you what.

196
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,279
If I had a human baby that could fly,
I wouldn't be telling the press about it.

197
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,750
If I had a flying baby,
I'd zip this, and so would you.

198
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,513
There is no experimental backing
for anything in that book.

199
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,670
And it makes me look like a crazy person.

200
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,194
- God! Are you kidding me?
- What?

201
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,316
I got one wonton!

202
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,313
I got a tub of soup,
and I got one split wonton.

203
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,152
Look at that, just floating there.

204
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,416
I'm sorry you're having
a soup crisis right now.

205
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,908
There's not even any meat in there.
That's just a carrot.

206
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,274
Abby, please.

207
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,078
- Yes.
- Abby!

208
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,160
I got one wonton!

209
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,549
What do I have to do?

210
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,076
I will take my top off for Bennie
if it gets me three more wontons.

211
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,719
I swear to God.

212
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,628
You carry a lot of tension
in your shoulders.

213
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,675
I'm sorry, hello? Who are you?

214
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,637
Holtzmann. Virgo.

215
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,836
Avid skier. Gluten-full.

216
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,800
And 100% jazzed to meet you.

217
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,631
Don't get too close to her, Holtzmann.

218
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,056
She'll ask you to write a book,
and then she'll squash your dreams.

219
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,115
Okay.

220
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,536
Holtzmann works
with me here in the lab.

221
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,030
She's a brilliant engineer and very loyal.

222
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,991
She would not abandon you.

223
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,439
I get it.

224
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,318
She also happens to specialize
in experimental particle physics.

225
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,073
- Oh.
- She was almost hired by CERN.

226
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,434
That's very impressive.

227
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,158
Uh, what happened?

228
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,754
- There was a lab incident.
- But he's gonna wake up.

229
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,757
- He woke up yesterday.
- Great.

230
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,831
Then he screamed
and went back into a coma.

231
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,831
Well, I bet all that screaming
tuckered him out.

232
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,434
Um, can we get back
to our discussion please?

233
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,149
Oh, gosh, it sounds like a great time,
but I'm gonna have to say no

234
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,310
because Holtzmann and
I are really busy here

235
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,756
actualizing what we just
theorized about in our book.

236
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,875
- Really?
- Yeah.

237
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,475
We're incredibly close on the hollow laser
for the reverse tractor beam.

238
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,788
Really close.

239
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,360
You're making a reverse tractor beam?

240
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,352
Abby, why don't you let
her listen to the EVP.

241
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,476
- What EVP?
- No. Not... There's no EVP.

242
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,074
- EVP is electro...
- Electro voice phenomenon.

243
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,752
I'm familiar. I know what it means.

244
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,354
And there's never been one substantiated.

245
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,317
Oh, there hasn't? There hasn't been one...

246
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,833
You know what? You come with me.

247
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,036
With a suit on and you get so cocky.

248
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,949
A few months ago,
we spent eight nights at the Chelsea Hotel.

249
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,189
We didn't get anything.

250
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,198
Well, we didn't think so.

251
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:37,114
And then later, in the lab,
when we were reviewing these tapes...

252
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,936
- Wow, you really got me.
- You know what?

253
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,456
Usually we can't even get people over here.

254
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,416
- But we have never...
- She came right over to it.

255
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,238
Never had anybody actually
put their face down close to the machine.

256
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,232
It's a cool joke. That was funny.
It's disgusting.

257
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,776
Is it more or less disgusting
if I tell you it came from the front?

258
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,110
- Oh, you didn't... Oh.
- I can do it live if you want.

259
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,997
What's next? You gonna give me a wedgie?

260
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,472
No. I think both of us pretty much feel
you have enough stuck up your butt.

261
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,915
Burn!

262
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,856
Okay, you know what, I thought
we could have an adult conversation,

263
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,632
but apparently we can't.

264
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,029
Erin, if you don't believe
in this stuff anymore,

265
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,076
then why were you looking for the book?

266
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,199
A man came to see me at my work
saying his building was haunted.

267
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,760
What building?

268
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,432
The Aldridge Mansion.

269
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,636
It's obviously a joke.

270
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,313
What are you doing?

271
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,435
Uh!

272
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,656
See, this is, this is exactly...

273
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,557
- You want to go find some ghosts?
- Yes.

274
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,040
Break!

275
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,120
Ooh!

276
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,190
- Wait, you're going?
- I got the pack.

277
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,837
Abby! Please, Abby. The book.

278
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,751
Come on. Let's go!

279
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,114
I'm not going with you guys.

280
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,792
Oh, no. Are you kidding?

281
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,279
You were never invited!

282
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,669
I need you out of the lab,
so I can lock the door.

283
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,115
Oh. Well, you said "let's," so...

284
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,656
- Oh, my God. Just pull the...
- We're wasting time.

285
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,176
Just close the door behind you, it'll lock!

286
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,519
Abby, wait!

287
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,553
Hey! Taxi!

288
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,474
- Hey! Hey!
- Abby.

289
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,039
Abby, come on.

290
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,156
Please, Abby, just
take the book down. Please.

291
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,913
All right, all right,

292
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,231
but you have to introduce us
to this guy at the Aldridge Mansion.

293
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,560
Yes, he would love to meet you.

294
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,795
Then I will consider, maybe,

295
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,952
taking the book down
until you get your stupid tenure

296
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,393
at your stupider college.

297
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,710
Absolutely. Yes, I will. Yes, of course!

298
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,349
You got it?

299
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,191
Excuse me! Excuse me!

300
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,709
We're not open.

301
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,552
- Can I help you?
- Yes. Hi.

302
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,959
We're looking for Ed Mulgrave.

303
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,713
- I wanted to introduce these people to him.
- Hi there.

304
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,518
He came to see me this morning.

305
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,511
- Ed Mulgrave?
- Yes.

306
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,160
But Ed Mulgrave died 15 years ago.

307
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,032
- Yes! That's awesome!
- What?

308
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,678
Dead for 15 years!

309
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,955
Ed's a ghost! Ha! Knew it!

310
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,599
I just saw him today... Oh.

311
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,595
He's...

312
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,189
So, who is this?

313
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,396
That's Ed's son. Ed Junior.

314
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,256
Okay. That's obviously who I meant.
That's...

315
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,796
Hi, Junior. If I may, uh, when is the last
time the paranormal entity was actually seen?

316
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,839
And if you were to rank it, let's
say between probably a T1 and T5...

317
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,037
Garret here saw it on Tuesday,
and I believe it made him soil himself.

318
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,190
- Jesus.
- Wow. Soiling.

319
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,032
I'd put that at a T3.

320
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,634
T4, if it was poop.

321
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,216
- What?
- Unless you ate something weird.

322
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,434
Then it wasn't the ghost.

323
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,636
Kinda hard to suss that out
after the fact though.

324
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,948
I didn't soil myself.

325
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,840
He did. He called me sobbing, saying,
"Oh, my God, my pants are toast."

326
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,354
Did you happen to keep
a sample of the soiling?

327
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,475
A sample?

328
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,536
- Okay. All right.
- I'd love to get that back to the lab.

329
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,279
Well, uh, so I have
made the introduction.

330
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,793
- Yeah, thank you.
- There you go.

331
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,776
All right, well, how 'bout
you take us across the street.

332
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,314
I got to get in there, set up.
Let's go on a tour.

333
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,480
Uh...

334
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,993
You're gonna die in there.

335
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,239
Aldridge Mansion. Take one.

336
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,117
And we are rolling.

337
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,156
Checking the settings. We look good.

338
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,195
What is that?

339
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,033
Looks like one of those things
that makes cotton candy.

340
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,997
It's a PKE meter.

341
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,876
There's a ghost anywhere around here,
this baby's gonna find it.

342
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,315
Does it work?

343
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,670
Uh, yeah, it works.

344
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,435
I just haven't had the appropriate
proximity to an entity for it to work.

345
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,999
Strange reading here.

346
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,119
Ma'am, can you tell us where you got
the world's tiniest bow tie?

347
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,350
Uh, it came with the shirt.

348
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,070
Okay, somebody really doesn't
want us getting in that door.

349
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,616
Can you tell us what it's like
to walk around in those shoes all day?

350
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,756
- It's not fun.
- All right.

351
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,110
Oh, Holtzmann, check this out.

352
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,349
Hold your ponies.

353
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,953
All right. Good gag.

354
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,553
Hey, are you getting that?

355
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,675
Very funny.

356
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,672
Is everything a joke to you guys?

357
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,989
Just your mama.

358
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,230
No, actually,
I think the world of your mom.

359
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,311
You guys put all that
gooey stuff on the floor.

360
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,269
You opened the basement door.
You tried to freak me out.

361
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,958
We did not open the basement door...

362
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,235
Basement door is open.

363
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,829
- I didn't open it. Did you open it?
- I did not open it.

364
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,056
You know what, it was probably Ed.
And the guy who didn't poop his pants.

365
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,513
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

366
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,794
Look over there.

367
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,878
I didn't even know it did that.

368
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,828
Oh. Ah.

369
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,876
- I... My ears just...
- Mine just popped, too.

370
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,960
That is definitely...

371
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,678
- An AP-xH shift. Yes!
- Shift.

372
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,274
- I mean, for sure. That's...
- Uh, guys?

373
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,592
I don't think we're alone.

374
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,908
Holy crap.

375
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,473
Let me have the camera. Thank you.

376
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,595
Okay.

377
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,872
How can you be eating right now?

378
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,313
Once you pop...

379
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,558
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

380
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,472
Good God.

381
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,232
Class 4 apparition.

382
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,833
Distinct human form.

383
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,797
This can't be happening.

384
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,472
Oh, it's happening, all right.

385
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,480
That's the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.

386
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,639
I'm gonna try to talk to it.

387
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,549
Just be careful,
she could be malevolent.

388
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,517
Yeah, just make sure you're recording it.

389
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,113
- Yeah, I'm getting it all.
- Okay.

390
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,519
Just be cautious.

391
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,035
I think she wants
to communicate with us.

392
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,400
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.

393
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,997
It's okay. She seems peaceful.

394
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,679
Hello.

395
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,593
I think you're gorgeous.

396
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,554
Hello. Hi.

397
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,759
Um, my name is Erin Gilbert,
Doctor of Particle Physics at Columbia...

398
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,432
- Yes!
- Oh, God!

399
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,748
She's getting away! Come on!

400
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,078
- Hurry, hurry!
- Run!

401
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,256
- Get it, get it!
- Where'd it go? Where'd it go?

402
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,032
- Where'd it go? Where'd it go?
- There!

403
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,200
Oh!

404
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,033
What just happened?

405
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,678
Abby, what just happened?

406
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,674
I'll tell you what just happened.
We saw a ghost.

407
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,016
- We saw a ghost!
- Yeah, we saw a ghost!

408
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,678
We saw a ghost! Oh, my God!

409
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,273
- We saw a ghost.
- We saw a ghost!

410
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,637
Oh, my God, we saw a ghost!

411
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,152
We were right! We weren't crazy!

412
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,674
- Oh. Oh.
- Oh. Oh.

413
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,633
We saw a ghost!

414
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,517
Ghosts are real! Ghosts are real!

415
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,136
I believe in ghosts 'cause I just saw one!

416
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,400
They're real!

417
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,318
Who is that?

418
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,834
- Dr. Bronstein saw this on Reddit.
- Hmm.

419
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,631
It was re-blogged
from a site entitled Ghost News.

420
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,231
Not a publication I'd heard of.

421
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,073
I hope you understand that
when we give someone tenure...

422
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,879
Oh, I accept your tenure.

423
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,794
When we give someone tenure,
they represent this institution.

424
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,550
But this is just not
what this institution is about.

425
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,116
Ah, Dr. Gibbons.

426
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,836
Found mold in my office, so I gotta move.

427
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,673
Don't tell anyone.
I don't want people to panic or anything.

428
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,954
Kids, hello.

429
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,430
I didn't get fired. Even though
I have the old plant in the box.

430
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,273
Margaret, hi.
Just taking my plant out for some air.

431
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,871
Just like to carry it in this box
with all my other personal stuff.

432
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,310
Phil. Phil. Hi. Phil, um...

433
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,039
If you turn around, you'll see me.
I'm right behind you.

434
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,951
Oh, yeah. He's looking at that chart.

435
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,976
Couldn't figure that out, either.
Call me when you figure that out.

436
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,558
Haven't been able to.

437
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,874
Samantha. Hi. How are you?

438
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,350
Ugh. Sixty. Seventy.

439
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,576
Sometimes, I like to
put all my stuff from my office in a box

440
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,797
and just do some exercises
and just use it as weights. Eighty.

441
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,795
Well, I hope you're happy.

442
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,119
That video you posted got me fired.

443
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,800
Fired!

444
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:15,153
- No! God, no! We will all die.
- Turn to ash from the inside out.

445
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,470
- What?
- Put it down. Carefully.

446
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,676
- Put it... Put it down... Oh, my God.
- Fired!

447
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,995
After years,

448
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,789
years of hard work.

449
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,108
And ass-kissing.

450
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,236
God, I kissed so many
different kinds of asses.

451
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,471
Erin, we're sorry that you lost your job.

452
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,313
But, I mean, there is
kind of a glass is half full aspect of it.

453
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,516
I mean, we saw a real ghost.

454
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,079
You know, and she was beautiful.

455
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,158
Till she dislocated her jaw
and ecto-projected all over you.

456
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,834
Yeah, that stuff went everywhere,
by the way, in every crack.

457
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:50,311
But, I got to say, even that was
kind of spectacularly beautiful.

458
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,510
I did detect a heavy ionization discharge.

459
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,600
I mean, I could smell it.

460
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,559
A full-torso transmogrification
with corporeal aggression.

461
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,517
I mean, how often does that happen?

462
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,431
I mean, they want us to
be quiet about that?

463
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,397
We are not gonna be quiet about that.

464
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,677
And it's not just us.
We have over 100 comments already.

465
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,119
And they're not all crazies.

466
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,600
Come here, I want to show you this.

467
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,033
Read that.

468
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,714
"Ain't no bitches gonna hunt no ghosts."

469
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,358
Oh, no, no. Okay.

470
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,078
The one below it.

471
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,755
This woman is describing
a Class 3 haunting in her house.

472
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,195
She can't just move.
She can't call the police.

473
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,136
She can't call her friends.
Who's she gonna call?

474
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,151
Ghost Jumpers!

475
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,736
Tonight, the Ghost Jumpers
make contact with the ghost of Bigfoot.

476
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,716
God! These phonies!

477
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,028
I mean, you know what?

478
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,711
These guys are the reason you got fired.

479
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,873
It's because of stuff like this that makes it
impossible for us to do our real work.

480
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,719
This cannot be the best option for people.

481
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,951
Okay, we are on the cusp of something here,
a real discovery.

482
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,759
Unlike Columbia,
this institute is 100% behind us.

483
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,909
Really?

484
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,232
Erin, this is what we have dreamed about
since we were little kids.

485
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:04,831
I know that if you come and join us here,
they are gonna be so pumped.

486
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,434
We just have to go upstairs
and ask for more money.

487
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,478
I just honestly didn't realize
your department still existed.

488
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,074
- What?
- Come on, ghosts?

489
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:18,439
I will not let the 12-year reputation of
this fine institution be besmirched by you!

490
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,549
Oh, come on! Suddenly this place
has a classy reputation to uphold?

491
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,438
You're only dean now
because the last dean went to jail.

492
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,317
Are you saying that I'm not qualified?

493
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,595
You spell science with a "Y ".

494
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:33,434
And what's upsetting about that is
I don't think you know that that's wrong.

495
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,671
This is an institution of higher learning.

496
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,637
And if you guys want to study "ghosts,"

497
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,269
do it somewhere else,
because I have two words for you.

498
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,793
Let me guess, "Get out"?

499
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,519
- No, he's gonna say "suck it."
- He's not gonna say "suck it."

500
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,159
Suck it.

501
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,856
- You were right.
- You know...

502
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,029
Oh, my gosh.

503
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,314
I think it might be a ghost.

504
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,278
Oh, no, it's not. It's just a bird.

505
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,679
Bye. There's the door.

506
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,955
Later days. Can you hear this?
Let me turn it up.

507
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,799
Oh, my God.

508
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,395
This is incredibly immature behavior.

509
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,229
Caught it.

510
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,992
Just a minor setback.

511
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,389
You know what, guys?
I think we can really do this.

512
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,631
We can become the first scientists
to prove the existence of the paranormal.

513
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,910
All we have to do
is find an entity and capture it

514
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,992
and bring it into a controlled environment.
That's all!

515
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,597
Hey! There's the Erin I remember.
Welcome back.

516
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,796
- Thank you.
- Nice.

517
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,616
Okay, we should probably
get this equipment out of here.

518
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,816
- They're gonna want it back.
- I thought this stuff was yours.

519
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,955
- All stolen.
- No...

520
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,315
Hey! That worthless garbage
belongs to this school!

521
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,278
Scatter! Scatter! Scatter!

522
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,273
Go, go, go, scatter!

523
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,035
Hey. Uh, good morning.

524
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,439
Okay.

525
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,195
Hey, how you doing, sir? Got a Metro...

526
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,511
Hey. That's a dope jacket, man.
I got that jacket.

527
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,875
You know what? It's a sweater.
I made a mistake.

528
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,279
You have a good day, all right?

529
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,195
Whoa. Hey! How you doing, man?

530
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,838
They'll always ignore you.

531
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:09,835
They are walking sewage,
concerned only with their own trivial matters.

532
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,189
Okay. Um...

533
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,600
When the Fourth Cataclysm begins,

534
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:16,719
laborers, such as yourself,
will be among the last led to the butchery.

535
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,995
So, make the most of your extra time.

536
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,109
You are just a bundle of joy, ain't ya?

537
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,589
You have a good day with your crazy ass.

538
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,715
Wow!

539
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,279
I wonder what train he taking.

540
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,277
Is he going on the tracks?

541
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,840
Oh, man...

542
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,350
You want to use the bathroom,

543
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,671
there's a perfectly nice bathroom
upstairs at Starbucks.

544
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,239
Hey, hey!

545
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,720
Hey, you're not supposed to be
down here, man. Only subway...

546
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,875
Whoa!

547
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,430
What in the sweet hell?

548
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,908
Exquisite.

549
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,551
Uh, I'm cool, dude. Yeah.

550
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,869
Forget this, man!

551
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,190
Forget this!

552
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,395
Aldridge Mansion? Check.

553
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,150
Seward Street subway station?

554
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,309
Check.

555
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,518
Well done, Rowan.

556
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,756
But still so many more checks to go.

557
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,718
You have been bullied your entire life.

558
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,590
Now you will be the bully.

559
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,113
Trust in your abilities,

560
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,795
and the universe shall
bend before your will.

561
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,669
Hey, weirdo.
We got a clogged toilet in 1843. It's bad.

562
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,440
I mean, like, biblically bad. Get on it.

563
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,669
Absolutely.

564
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,591
Nothing would make me happier.

565
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,911
Whatever, freak show. Just do it.

566
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:44,198
And the universe shall
bend before your will.

567
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,838
Charge the lines.

568
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,309
Create the vortex.

569
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,118
Break the barrier.

570
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,879
I found a fantastic spot for your business.

571
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,279
It's more of a research lab.

572
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,236
- What do you think?
- That's it?

573
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,200
Let's go see your new home.

574
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,896
- Oh, my God! Look at...
- Look at it!

575
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,840
- Look at how high!
- Look at the amazing spread!

576
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,518
Look at the ceiling to the floor height!

577
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,400
Oh.

578
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,277
Look at this. Look at it.

579
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,800
It's perfect.

580
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,552
- We got tons of space.
- Stripper pole!

581
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,233
- Uh, we'll take it.
- Great.

582
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,914
- The rent is $21,000 a month.
- Fuck you.

583
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,679
- Excuse me?
- I'm sorry. That's the rent?

584
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,591
- Yeah.
- Who can afford that?

585
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,999
All your friend said was that

586
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,310
you were looking for a place
to explore the unknown.

587
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,256
Okay, we need to explore
something a lot cheaper.

588
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,349
There's an upstairs!

589
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,396
Are you offended by the smell
of Chinese food?

590
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,709
I have now moved above you,
and you still can't help me out.

591
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,031
How does it take you an hour
to go up one flight of stairs?

592
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,439
I have really bad knees.

593
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,915
You know what?

594
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,560
What is that?

595
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,511
It's our hot and sour shrimp soup.

596
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,195
That looks like dishwater and one shrimp,
and I think it's...

597
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,157
I hope that's a water chestnut.

598
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,511
When it feels like

599
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,477
The world is on your shoulders

600
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,869
And all of the madness

601
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,473
Has got you going crazy

602
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,512
Oh, we're dancing? Okay.

603
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,188
Let's be safe, though.

604
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,920
Where all of the action

605
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,996
Is right there at your feet, well

606
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,958
Holtz. Holtz. Holtzmann!

607
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,439
Fire!

608
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,958
Over towards the fire.

609
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,720
Thank you.

610
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,314
You'll be doing fine once the music starts

611
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,630
I hate to DeBarge in.

612
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,551
- She loves that.
- Is that by DeBarge?

613
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,816
I thought it was Devo.

614
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,035
- Anyway, I got the website up.
- Oh.

615
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,096
I passed out a bunch of these fliers
all over town,

616
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,917
so I'm drumming us up a little business.

617
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,992
"If you see something, say something."

618
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,718
- It's catchy.
- It's good.

619
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,997
- Yeah, I'll take it.
- I think it might be the anti-terrorism slogan.

620
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,479
Oh, God.

621
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,110
- It is, isn't it?
- It is. I'm sorry.

622
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,336
Well, I guess now we know
why so many people are calling

623
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,476
about suspicious-looking bags.

624
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,434
Dang it.

625
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,511
- I love the green paper!
- Thank you.

626
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,669
Hey. Uh, I'm here about
the receptionist job.

627
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,310
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

628
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,232
Is this a big ol' robot?

629
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,835
What?

630
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,816
The receptionist job that was in the paper.
Um, that's what I was here about.

631
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,193
You're hired.

632
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,955
Okay, I... God, you're all sweaty.

633
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,600
I think I got it.
"If there's something strange in the..."

634
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,720
Ow.

635
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,720
Oh!

636
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,040
Kevin. Right?

637
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,120
- Kevin.
- Yeah.

638
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,553
Abby. We spoke on the phone.

639
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,800
- We did. Yeah.
- Hello there.

640
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,115
- Okay.
- Kevin. Oh.

641
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,872
That's a manly name.

642
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,394
My name's Erin. With an "E."

643
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,630
For "everything you want."

644
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,030
- Okay. Well, we should probably...
- Hmm.

645
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,154
Should probably get started.

646
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,151
Erin? Do you want to join us?

647
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,629
- Yes.
- Erin.

648
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,153
I've got some questions.

649
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,511
Okay. Here we go.

650
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,273
Let me just get to my notes.

651
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,351
Um... Okay.

652
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,396
All right, first off, I just want to say...

653
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,074
You know, we should probably
start with a very important question

654
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,709
that we're asking all of the applicants.

655
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,314
Um, you know,
are you seeing anyone right now?

656
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,552
- Um, seeing anyone?
- Yeah.

657
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,074
- Just for business purposes.
- Business purposes only.

658
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,120
Well, I'm seeing all three of you.

659
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,474
In front of me.

660
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,678
Oh, just forget she even asked,
because if she did, that would be illegal, so...

661
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Forgotten.

662
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,080
Good.

663
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,116
No, I've forgotten.
I don't know what you asked.

664
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,640
There we go.

665
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,553
Uh, Jillian Holtzmann, Radio Times.

666
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:47,349
Uh, what have you been doing
with your whole life?

667
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,509
Great question.

668
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,875
Oh, well, um, lots of different jobs.

669
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,520
Um, I did the "actor thing."

670
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,160
- Worked for...
- I'm just gonna... Just real quick.

671
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,791
Can I ask why no glass?

672
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,475
Oh, uh, yeah. They just kept getting dirty,
so I took them out.

673
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,216
- That's...
- Don't have to clean them anymore.

674
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,296
- Oh, boy.
- And I can just...

675
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,311
- I got to try to keep that in mind.
- Yeah.

676
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,715
Would it be okay if I bring Mike Hat
to work sometimes?

677
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,950
He has major anxiety problems.

678
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,470
You know what? I would love
to let your cat live here with you,

679
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,869
but I have a pretty severe cat allergy.

680
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,559
No, I don't have a cat.

681
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,200
He's a dog. His name is Mike Hat.

682
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,591
Your dog's name is My Cat?

683
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,159
No, Mike Hat.

684
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,470
Your dog's name is Mike, last name Hat?

685
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,312
Well, his full name is Michael Hat.

686
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,075
I can't say that I'm
allergic to dogs, so...

687
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,878
It's all right. He lives with my mum.

688
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,056
- Well, then we have that figured out.
- Okay. That was...

689
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,150
One down. No cat.

690
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,629
But you know what I say,
let's jump ahead, uh...

691
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,475
Kevin dabbles in web design.

692
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,153
And I asked him to throw together

693
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,356
- maybe a couple of logos for us.
- Uh-huh.

694
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,856
- You want to see them?
- Now is your moment.

695
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,677
- Pull it out.
- Oh.

696
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,829
Sure.

697
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,588
You're like a lawsuit waiting to happen.

698
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,473
Here we go.

699
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,920
Okay, so...

700
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,919
What do you think of that?

701
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,788
Oh.

702
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,909
Yeah, you do see how this
might make us look bad, right?

703
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,191
Uh, is it the boobs you don't like?
'Cause I can make them bigger.

704
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,952
No, I can see them.

705
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,190
Ghost Tits was my nickname
in middle school.

706
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,315
Oh, right?

707
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,656
You know what? I think
it's not always about the end result.

708
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,113
It's about the journey.

709
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,599
Well, uh, what about this one?

710
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,949
- Oh, uh...
- Uh...

711
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,713
I think that's already a thing.

712
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,835
What, 7-1-1?

713
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,035
It's 7-Eleven.

714
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,576
Yep, it is. I have another option, though.

715
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,033
- Okay, please.
- It's this one.

716
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,376
That's one of my favorites.

717
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,216
Uh... I think you might've made a mistake.
I don't think that one's for us.

718
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,673
Oh, no. No, that's for you.

719
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:41,839
You know, I just thought the floating hot
dog implies that a ghost is holding it.

720
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,757
Your work is
more cerebral than I expected.

721
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,310
Still, so many questions about that choice.

722
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,995
First one is, why a hot dog?

723
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,515
Oh, I just like them.

724
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,710
Both food groups, all in one.

725
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,755
Dogs and buns.

726
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,193
- Those are great.
- Yeah.

727
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,511
We're actually gonna
discuss everything just for a second,

728
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,232
so if you could just stand over there,

729
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,197
- we just need to convene for a moment.
- Okay.

730
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,679
- Sure. All right.
- Thank you.

731
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,096
Just go right over there.

732
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,235
Don't listen.

733
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,880
I won't.

734
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,912
Oh. He covered his eyes.

735
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,313
Guys, look, as much as
I would like to have him here to look at...

736
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,628
- Um...
- What?

737
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,878
You don't find him attractive?

738
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,515
Kevin?

739
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,955
Ow!

740
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,638
God, no. Poor guy.

741
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,200
Ow!

742
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,433
- I don't know, guys. I don't know.
- Come on, Erin.

743
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,953
We need help around here.

744
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,856
We cannot keep carrying
that equipment up here.

745
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,997
And I know the phones aren't ringing
off the hook right now, but they will be.

746
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,911
You know,
an aquarium is a submarine for fish.

747
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,536
Listen, let's just see
how the rest of the day goes.

748
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,838
You know, talk to other people, and we will
hire who is most qualified, okay? Deal?

749
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,150
There are no other people.
He's the only applicant.

750
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,240
Excellent.

751
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,872
God, that's loud, huh?

752
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,598
- It's loud.
- It's loud.

753
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,589
- Kevin. You got the job.
- Hmm?

754
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,238
- Welcome aboard.
- Cool.

755
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,874
Can I bring my suitcases up?

756
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,279
Yep, you sure can.

757
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,909
Look at him.

758
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,240
Ow!

759
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,032
Oh, uh, ma'am?

760
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:14,396
Hi, ma'am. If you're waiting for takeout,
you should really wait downstairs.

761
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,480
Oh!

762
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,274
This... The magazine was here,
so, I don't know,

763
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,476
I just thought that might be
your waiting room.

764
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,755
You know, fun fact about this place,

765
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,400
that this building is
built in the same place

766
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,995
as the first Chinese gambling den
in New York. Did you know that?

767
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,435
I mean, it's, like, coincidence, huh?

768
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,199
Also, um, I got chased by a ghost.

769
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,549
What?

770
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,393
You know, up above us
was the old New York prison.

771
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,552
It's the first place in New York
that they electrocuted people.

772
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,029
I'm telling you, it used to take so long

773
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:48,032
that they'd just be like, "Shoot him.
We using too much electricity."

774
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,600
That's why I knew something weird
was going on down here, man.

775
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,480
Whoa. Did you see that?

776
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,336
- Yes. I saw that.
- Did you see that?

777
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,237
- That wasn't me.
- I saw that quite a bit.

778
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,073
Wait, wait. Hey! Seriously? For real?

779
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,275
'Ey. Come on, man.

780
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,915
- Didn't I tell you?
- Is he down here all the time?

781
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,116
Oh, he think this is his art studio.

782
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,839
No, no. My studio is in SoHo.
This is more of a gallery.

783
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,148
Okay, hello there.

784
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:15,995
Uh, have you seen a Class 4, semi-anchored
entity anywhere in the vicinity?

785
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,150
- You talking like a boat?
- Can you speak English?

786
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,276
- I'm being specifically clear.
- Let me. Let me.

787
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,960
Hi. Have you seen a ghost down here?

788
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,336
- Okay, that's clearer.
- Yeah.

789
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,078
- Yeah, I've seen a ghost.
- You, too?

790
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,160
Oh, yeah.

791
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,832
Would you be able to describe it to us?

792
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,875
- Thank you.
- But...

793
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,393
Ah, come on, man. Come on, man.

794
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,816
No, no, no, no. Let him, let him...

795
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,856
- I'll take a visual.
- No! I can't let him.

796
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,976
This is my job. I'm gonna get fired!

797
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,336
- We want the visual!
- No, no, this is very helpful.

798
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,952
This is not helpful for me.

799
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,076
'Ey. Look at me. Stop.

800
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,511
- Stop painting.
- I'm so sorry.

801
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,736
I don't like this on my wall.

802
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,816
You don't want it here anymore?

803
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,896
- I don't want this ghost on my wall.
- No ghost.

804
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,216
- Let me fix this, then.
- Well, I...

805
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,240
No ghosts allowed.

806
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,816
- You know what? You know what?
- Right?

807
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,136
- Get your ass up out of here.
- Come on.

808
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,275
Bye, Patty!

809
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,793
- I love you.
- Man!

810
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,359
This ain't art!

811
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,074
And y'all encouraging him.

812
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,479
Come on!

813
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,595
Come on!

814
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,234
Am I on crack, or is that a good logo?

815
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,950
Guys, I cannot do it by myself.

816
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,759
This equipment is untested
and highly unstable.

817
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,476
All right, ladies,
we got a limited window

818
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,959
for when the next train arrives,

819
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,075
I'm telling you.

820
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,360
And don't touch the third rail

821
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,631
unless y'all little dainty ass
can handle 750 volts.

822
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,155
- Oh, come on.
- You know what?

823
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,232
I should've gave you some coveralls, man.
It's so unsanitary down here.

824
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:37,393
You know, you don't usually think
about the amount of urine smell.

825
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,990
That's pretty much how it's gonna be.
It's not gonna freshen up at all.

826
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,638
Oh, boy. Okay.

827
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,216
Definitely got something over here.
Look at... Is that...

828
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,355
What is that, a burn?

829
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,240
That's where I saw that
weird sparking thing.

830
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,315
What was it?

831
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,597
Baby, if I knew what it was,
I wouldn't say "a weird sparking thing."

832
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,790
You're mouthy. I like that.

833
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,075
It looks like fission scorch.

834
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,799
What? Fission scorch down here?

835
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,199
Except that you're right.

836
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,556
What is... Wait, I'm smelling
both electrical discharge

837
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,232
- and isotopic decay.
- Isotopic decay.

838
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,799
How is that... Holtzmann?

839
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,400
- Yeah. What?
- Come here. I need your snoot on this.

840
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Am I nuts?

841
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,200
'Ey, 'ey, ladies.

842
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,078
While y'all over there making out
with that dirty piece of garbage,

843
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,936
we only got a couple of minutes.

844
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,274
Do you see that?

845
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,998
- The eyes.
- All right, Holtzmann.

846
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,355
- Now is not the time to be messing with...
- No.

847
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,390
Oh, cream and sugar.

848
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,319
Hey, Patty, can I get some
illumination on this subject?

849
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,840
Yeah, I can put some light on that.

850
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,079
- Oh, boy!
- Oh!

851
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,072
That is more and more unsettling.

852
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,674
That's the dude I saw!
I'm telling you, that's him!

853
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,988
We got another Class 4,

854
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:48,277
and this one's even more ionized
than the one at the Aldridge Mansion.

855
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,351
Where are these ghosts coming from?

856
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,176
You know what?
I got to get this thing on film.

857
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,200
- Holtzmann?
- Yup.

858
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,315
- Power us up.
- Okay.

859
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,755
'Cause we are taking this pretty boy
back to the lab.

860
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,416
This is a little rough.
It's in its early stages. Got to be honest.

861
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,237
Just gonna plug these things in here.

862
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,754
- Okay, Erin, come here.
- Let me document this.

863
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,440
- Grab it, grab it.
- Wait.

864
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,680
That's gonna shoot a proton stream
at that ghost, okay?

865
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,671
So whenever I say, "Go," you just do that.

866
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,876
Uh, why am I operating
the untested nuclear laser?

867
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,473
- You have the longest arms.
- Oh.

868
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,936
You guys might want to hurry up.

869
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,758
Oh, my God. I forgot the
most important part.

870
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,239
Yeah. Sorry.

871
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:23,949
Erin, this is just a little bit of
grounding so you don't die immediately.

872
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,393
Do you know your iron level?

873
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,600
Mmm-mmm.

874
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,910
It's fine.

875
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,513
You have done this before, right?

876
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,919
Okay, Erin, on my cue.

877
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,720
Aim the barrel at him.

878
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,395
Ready, aim, fire!

879
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,240
Oh!

880
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,560
Oh, wah-wah.

881
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,616
Okay, this is a little underwhelming.
Can we get more power?

882
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,959
And once again, fire!

883
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,875
- This isn't working!
- Wow!

884
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,871
Can this beam get any stronger?

885
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,190
Well, not at the moment.

886
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,720
Ah.

887
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,040
That's the train! We got to move!

888
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,000
Just try to lure him
back to the platform!

889
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,189
Grab her!

890
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,909
- Come on!
- Move, move, move!

891
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Come on, move!

892
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,718
Hurry!

893
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,120
That's the express train!

894
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,758
And it's not stopping!

895
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,033
It's coming! Get her up!

896
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,474
Oh, not the collar!

897
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,235
Well, I guess he going to Queens.

898
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,914
He's gonna be the third
scariest thing on that train.

899
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,991
God, did you see that?

900
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,071
Oh, you can't see anything.

901
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,636
My God! I mean,
that power surge really held him.

902
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,756
Wow! We need more juice.

903
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,456
We need to be more mobile.
I know what to do.

904
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,799
- Yes.
- I almost got killed.

905
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,438
Yeah, I know. It was so awesome.

906
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,520
It was awesome.

907
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,119
Everyone thinks this video is fake.
Look at these comments.

908
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,536
We have to bring a ghost back to this lab
and document it, you guys.

909
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,028
I mean, this stuff is real.
We have to be able to prove it.

910
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,040
We will. And you shouldn't
be reading this stuff.

911
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,016
You're not supposed to listen
to what crazy people write

912
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,256
in the middle of the night online.

913
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,111
Look at...
"Bogus equipment"? You know what?

914
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,589
I'd love you to meet me any place,
any time.

915
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,591
No, no, no, let's...
You're right. We should...

916
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,148
- Here is your coffee, Abby.
- Thank you.

917
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,117
Did you get sugar in it this time?

918
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:16,720
Uh...

919
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,154
I hate coffee.

920
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,040
- Yeah, the sugar's in there.
- Sugar's in it.

921
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,515
I'll take it.

922
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,194
Don't want to waste a cup of coffee.

923
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,479
Can we just pretend
that didn't happen, please?

924
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,630
All right, well, what do you think?

925
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,995
I... You know what? I
just can't watch that.

926
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,837
I'm not sure. I mean,
it's just a lot of bits and pieces.

927
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,376
I'm pretty sure none of it is
supposed to be in the subway, though.

928
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,834
It's like it was part of
a miniature cyclotron.

929
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,593
And they used
a chromium alloy for the hull.

930
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,234
I would've used aluminum, but I'm crazy.

931
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,398
What's that weird thing that guy said
to the lady from the subway?

932
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,416
Um... Oh, I know what you're talking about.

933
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,351
- Fourth Cataclysm. Yeah.
- Oh.

934
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,473
- Hi.
- Fourth Cataclysm.

935
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,199
Man, what they gonna do,
make a fifth one, starring The Rock?

936
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,111
Oh, yeah, you guys, you have a visitor.

937
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,270
Um, she's here to see you in the booth.

938
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,351
Booth number one. With the earrings.

939
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,836
- Yeah.
- Yeah. We see her now.

940
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:12,995
- Thanks.
- No worries.

941
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,680
I'm joining the club.

942
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,560
Um... Well, it's not really a... I'm sorry.

943
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,956
Kevin. Hi, can you answer
the phone, please?

944
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,758
- I can't. It's in the fish tank.
- Uh, no.

945
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,256
The one on the desk that's ringing.
That one.

946
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,838
- Oh, that one.
- Yep.

947
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,256
- Oh, my God.
- What's this place called again?

948
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,589
Conductors of
the Metaphysical Examination. Talk.

949
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:33,990
Got it. Uh, Conductors
of Metamucils and Stuff.

950
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,958
Whee, oh, slow down. I... What...

951
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,509
They hung up?

952
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,636
No, I was just not into that conversation.

953
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,474
Kevin, I'm really gonna need you
to try a little harder. Okay, buddy?

954
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,915
Well, if they call back, I will.
I got to take off, though.

955
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,998
I'm in a hide-and-seek tournament,
and we are in the semis.

956
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,356
Uh, Kevin, I'm gonna need you
to pick up all those suitcases.

957
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:56,520
- Ouch.
- Oh!

958
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,113
Eh, did you hurt your face?

959
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,431
Hey, did y'all hire that big dumb dude?

960
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,589
Bye!

961
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,551
Man, I got a cousin Mookie.

962
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,990
He is half as stupid,
and he will work for Vienna sausages.

963
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:12,517
The thing is, this isn't really a club.
It's a scientific research group.

964
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,955
And I understand that,
but let me tell you something.

965
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,636
I read a lot of nonfiction,

966
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,473
and you guys know
a lot about this science stuff,

967
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,595
but I know New York.

968
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,398
And check this out!

969
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,710
I can borrow a car from my uncle,

970
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,136
and y'all won't have to lug
all this heavy equipment around.

971
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,136
- Oh, guys, we got to get a car.
- Come on, baby.

972
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,596
You need me. You need Patty.
Patty come with benefits. You need me.

973
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,238
Stop playing like you don't.

974
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,389
You're in.

975
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,600
Ha!

976
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,352
Oh, yeah.

977
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:45,115
You get a car,
and you get a car, and you get a car!

978
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:50,069
Uh, you didn't disclose
that the vehicle was gonna be a hearse.

979
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:54,119
I'm sorry. My uncle owns a funeral home,
not a Enterprise Rent-A-Car.

980
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,400
Hope you checked to see
there wasn't a body in the back.

981
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,550
Uh, I don't think so. I don't really know.

982
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:00,834
You didn't check?

983
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,035
I mean, I was in a hurry.

984
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,873
I checked to see if we had gas.
That was more important.

985
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:05,995
So there is a body?

986
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,275
Let Holtzmann check.
She likes that type of stuff.

987
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:11,511
Yeah, I can think of seven good uses
of a cadaver today.

988
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,272
No, Dr. Frankenstein,

989
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,794
we got to turn in the body
if there's one in there.

990
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,475
- All right.
- Don't do that.

991
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,718
- Excuse me, maintenance man.
- Mrs. Ponner.

992
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:26,949
How may I help you?

993
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:31,795
Well, for starters, perhaps you can tell me
what in God's name this is?

994
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,757
Mrs. Ponner, this is nothing more than
some leakage from our air conditioning.

995
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:39,232
Well, I think it's touched my skin,
and it's given me a rash.

996
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,879
Does it look right?

997
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,750
Mrs. Ponner, I wanted to say no.

998
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,271
But, yes, I'm afraid there is some redness

999
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:51,840
in here.

1000
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,111
- Is it very bad?
- No.

1001
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,073
Of course not, Mrs. Ponner.

1002
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,879
But I assure you,
whoever is responsible for this

1003
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:03,349
will be flogged within an inch of their life
and then left on the street to die like a pig.

1004
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:07,753
- Well, I didn't ask for that.
- Well, in that case, I'll send up some cream.

1005
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,078
I know everyone is anxious,
but we have to be patient.

1006
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:28,359
Who thought it would be funny
to put Earl in that old lady's back?

1007
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:34,038
The guests are starting to complain.

1008
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,709
And we don't want to give away any spoilers
before the big show.

1009
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:40,915
See you soon.

1010
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,591
Very soon.

1011
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,274
Based on the results
of the subway field test...

1012
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,936
The one where you were
almost killed, remember?

1013
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,029
I remember.

1014
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:53,636
I added a booster using microfabricated
radio-frequency quadrupoles

1015
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:56,439
to speed up particles
before entering the DLA device,

1016
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,873
- portable, wearable for maximum flexibility.
- Wow.

1017
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,554
Then we add the reversible
psychokinetic energy sync

1018
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,712
plus Holtzy's hollow beam to this baby,
and voilà.

1019
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,438
- We got a ghost in there.
- Whoo!

1020
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,590
- Slap me.
- Okay.

1021
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,318
I will slap you as...

1022
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,336
I just want to say
what an exciting moment this is.

1023
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,271
Holtzmann, I am beyond impressed.

1024
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,952
Abby, is that comfortable?

1025
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:19,071
It's a lot heavier than I expected,

1026
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,958
and I'm pretty sure
it's compacting my spinal column, but...

1027
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,136
- So you're gonna want to plant your feet firm.
- Okay.

1028
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,628
Bend your knees
to compensate for the extra kickback.

1029
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,915
All right. Turning the machine on.

1030
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,832
Whoo!

1031
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,549
Boy, she's got an impressive purr.

1032
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,592
Okay, so, that little asshole over there
is the target.

1033
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:37,715
Okay.

1034
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,229
Just put your thumb
on that red trigger button there.

1035
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,992
- Yeah.
- And go to town.

1036
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,080
Okay.

1037
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,115
And here we go!

1038
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,600
Whoa!

1039
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:49,040
- Oh!
- Oh!

1040
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,536
I guess she's not
bending her knees enough, right?

1041
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,675
Whoo!

1042
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:57,911
She's doing a marvelous impression
of a deflating balloon.

1043
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,468
We just got to let her ride it out
until she's out of juice.

1044
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,312
She's corkscrewing me!

1045
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,120
Abby,
I'll make some adjustments.

1046
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,519
It's like fighting a gator!

1047
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,269
Hello.

1048
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,478
Looking forward to this metal show.

1049
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,160
Hi.

1050
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,509
Ozzy rocks! Whoo!

1051
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,720
Yeah!

1052
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,119
It's...

1053
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,872
He certainly does rock.

1054
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,035
This world cannot be cleansed fast enough.

1055
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:29,720
Hi.

1056
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:30,960
Enjoy the show.

1057
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Rock and roll.

1058
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,316
So, how did the two of you guys meet?

1059
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,551
Uh, Abby transferred
to my high school, junior year.

1060
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,119
Go, Karate Cats.

1061
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:47,034
We started telling ghost stories,
and we just kind of bonded right away.

1062
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:49,896
And all the other kids were, you know,
getting drunk and going to parties,

1063
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,480
and we're like,
"Uh, that's stupid."

1064
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,920
Plus, we weren't invited to any parties.

1065
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,016
Oh, you know what?
You know what I thought...

1066
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,216
Oh, I'm not gonna tell you.
I'm just gonna show you. You'll see.

1067
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:02,312
So, how did y'all get into ghosts?
Did one of you see one?

1068
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,518
Yeah, I did.

1069
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:05,600
Really?

1070
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:09,878
When I was eight years old,
the mean old lady that lived next door died.

1071
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,429
And that night, I woke up

1072
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,511
and she was standing at the foot of my bed,

1073
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,795
just staring at me.

1074
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:26,593
She did that every night for almost a year.

1075
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:27,795
What?

1076
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:32,193
And I told my parents,
and they didn't believe me.

1077
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,111
Still don't believe me.

1078
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,837
I had to go to therapy for years,

1079
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,798
and the kids at school found out,

1080
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:42,758
and they would laugh at me
and make fun of me,

1081
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,273
call me "ghost girl."

1082
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,630
Abby was the only person who believed me.

1083
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,591
Kids is mean, man. But I believe you.

1084
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,195
Thanks.

1085
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,311
- I have some questions.
- Seriously?

1086
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,392
- Okay, ready?
- Oh, no.

1087
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,600
- I found this in a box when we were moving.
- Oh, no.

1088
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:05,680
Oh, no!

1089
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:06,920
Oh, yes!

1090
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,195
I wish we still had this presentation.

1091
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,430
I mean, it was pretty great.

1092
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,397
I kinda wish I could've seen it, man.

1093
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,600
- You might just get your wish, Patty.
- No way.

1094
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,496
Wait, you have it?

1095
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,033
Damn, I wish I hadn't wished that.

1096
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,270
Ghosts, they're real!

1097
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:23,840
Lord, help us.

1098
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,718
- Para...
- ...normal...

1099
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,756
- ...is...
- ...normal.

1100
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,159
And a valid science.

1101
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,674
- Thank you for requesting this.
- I...

1102
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:38,588
Why don't I see ghosts
flying around everywhere?

1103
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,473
The barrier stops them.

1104
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:44,712
It's the last line of defense betwixt
the worlds of the living and the dead.

1105
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,310
Protect the barrier!
Protect the barrier! Protect the barrier!

1106
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:50,318
Or mankind will end.

1107
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,272
Oh!

1108
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,918
That was really good.

1109
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,991
- That was really good.
- We actually...

1110
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,389
- That was... I'm a little proud of us. Uh-oh.
- Yes.

1111
00:51:58,760 --> 00:51:59,760
Rhythmic clapping.

1112
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,956
I'm so goddamn happy
you two are back together.

1113
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,040
Aw.

1114
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:07,871
Man, I'm gonna tell you right now, y'all,
I was hating it up until the finale,

1115
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,473
but the finale is what got me.

1116
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,118
- Guys, we're on TV.
- Oh. What?

1117
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:15,352
A local team of paranormal investigators
released a video of a proclaimed ghost.

1118
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:18,836
You can see clearly there's something in
the picture that isn't easily explained.

1119
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:22,117
Oh, my God! They're showi ng the video!
We famous! We famous.

1120
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,856
As a result, there are
a lot of questions being asked now

1121
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,677
about the people who shot the video.

1122
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,230
So, what do we think of these Ghostbusters?
Are they to be taken seriously? And...

1123
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,197
"Ghostbusters"? That is not our name.

1124
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,696
They can't just make up a name
and just call us...

1125
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:33,776
I spoke with Martin Heiss earlier.

1126
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,256
- He's with the Council for Logic and Data.
- Okay.

1127
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,616
- Martin Heiss. Okay, okay.
- Okay.

1128
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,359
He is a famed debunker of the paranormal.

1129
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,616
Dr. Heiss, you're a highly regarded
scientific authority.

1130
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:44,200
- Your credentials are impeccable.
- Thank you, Pat.

1131
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,840
If you see something
of true scientific interest in this video,

1132
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:50,799
that goes a long way to legitimize these
Ghostbusters and everything they stand for.

1133
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,712
A game changer, yes.

1134
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,713
So, tell me, Dr. Heiss, is this for real?

1135
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:58,796
Hell no.

1136
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,798
So, now we're the ghost girls.

1137
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:02,833
I feel your pain, Erin.

1138
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,718
No. You know what? Screw that.

1139
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,233
We are scientists.

1140
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,639
- Plus Patty.
- Thank you.

1141
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:09,880
Okay, we believe in provable,

1142
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,400
physical results.

1143
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,080
- That's what we believe in.
- Yes, we do!

1144
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,269
- Preach.
- I will preach.

1145
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:15,616
You know what we're gonna do, ladies?

1146
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,835
We're gonna catch a ghost,
we're gonna bring...

1147
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,240
God.

1148
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,999
We're gonna catch a ghost,
bring it back to the lab...

1149
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:23,308
- Kevin?
- Yes, boss?

1150
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,896
Can you answer the phone
that's ringing, please?

1151
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:26,640
- Buddy.
- Yes, I can, boss.

1152
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,992
Uh, Ghostbusters.

1153
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,736
- "Conductors of the Metaphysical..."
- Okay.

1154
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:31,909
Cool. See ya.

1155
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,673
Hey, guys, which one of these
makes me look more like a doctor?

1156
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,478
Me playing saxophone
or me listening to saxophone?

1157
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,432
Who was on the phone?

1158
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,351
Uh, the Stonebrook Theatre?

1159
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,839
There's a goat on the loose.

1160
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,553
I'm gonna load up the car.

1161
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,751
- Whoa.
- Okay, okay, okay!

1162
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,280
Yo, yo, I got something for us, too!

1163
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,596
Hey, hey, hey, you guys,
I got these from work.

1164
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:55,874
I'm making it official, man.

1165
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,040
You put one of these on,
you won't get slimed again.

1166
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,736
- That's great.
- Yeah, we'll put them on in the car.

1167
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,830
- Okay.
- Erin!

1168
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:05,032
- Um...
- Oh.

1169
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,120
One second.

1170
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:07,840
Who's that?

1171
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:08,920
Erin!

1172
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,240
Hello, Phil.

1173
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:15,630
How do you just completely ignore
my calls and messages for a week?

1174
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,756
- Me? Ignore you?
- Yeah.

1175
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:21,469
You just stood there during the most
humiliating moment of my life.

1176
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:22,788
Is that her boyfriend?

1177
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:24,515
- No.
- Sexy.

1178
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,194
Who are you? Who are these people?

1179
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,874
You didn't tell me about
a book that you wrote,

1180
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:32,633
and now everyone's saying
you're some sort of crazy ghost hunter.

1181
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:36,076
Okay, well, first of all, that's wrong.
We don't hunt ghosts.

1182
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:39,436
We stalk them.
And we are very close to trapping one soon.

1183
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,878
And then we will study it
and do reports on it.

1184
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,918
- Yeah, he probably dances real sexy.
- Uh...

1185
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,036
You know what I'm saying,
like, just a wind...

1186
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,954
I don't think his hips move at all.

1187
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,270
I think he's mechanical
from, like, the rib cage down.

1188
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,430
- No!
- I know how that guy dances.

1189
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:56,960
- How's he dance?
- Like...

1190
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:58,989
No!

1191
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:01,389
I'm telling you, he...
Look, I bet you he get loose and...

1192
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:03,471
I bet you he pop locks. I bet you...

1193
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,312
He does... No!

1194
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,874
None of that. None of that's happening.

1195
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:11,589
- It's rigid. It's got a lot of teeth.
- Girl. Please.

1196
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,880
And he thinks he's doing you a favor.

1197
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,816
- Man, he rip that...
- And you're like, "Get it off me."

1198
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,990
He rip that V-neck off
and he gets it busy, man.

1199
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:21,709
And he's got... He rips that V-neck off,
he's got another V-neck underneath it.

1200
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,056
And you know what?
I don't care that people think I'm crazy.

1201
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,376
I don't care what you think, or anyone.

1202
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,550
Because what we're doing here
is groundbreaking.

1203
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:31,029
It's serious. We're doing important work.

1204
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:33,952
Hey!

1205
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,359
Look at this beauty!

1206
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,149
Whoo!

1207
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,234
Wait a minute.
What did you do to my uncle's hearse?

1208
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,320
I fixed it.

1209
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:43,520
Hey!

1210
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:47,354
He works at a funeral home!
I can't take this back with a ghost on it!

1211
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,016
It's our science mobile,
I'll have you know.

1212
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:53,192
And I'm about to go with my science friends,
and we are about to do real work.

1213
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,840
So, good day to you, sir.

1214
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,556
- Erin.
- We gotta go!

1215
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:00,352
We are late. Get in here.

1216
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,510
- Not you, Phil.
- Erin!

1217
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,716
- Funny.
- Erin, we have to... This is not funny.

1218
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:05,840
Just get in the...

1219
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,496
- Erin, please get in.
- Holtzmann, this is not the time.

1220
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,909
You are killing me. Erin.

1221
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,348
Oh, we have fun.

1222
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:18,641
If there's something strange
in the neighborhood

1223
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:20,629
Who you gonna call?

1224
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,153
Ghostbusters!

1225
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:25,550
If there's something weird
and it don't look good

1226
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:26,755
Who can you call?

1227
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:27,989
Ghostbusters!

1228
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,080
I'm calling

1229
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,038
I'm not afraid, not afraid

1230
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,192
I'm not afraid, not afraid

1231
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,955
I'm not afraid, not afraid

1232
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,036
Oh, I'm not afraid

1233
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,394
Nighttime, my lights on

1234
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:43,480
Whoo!

1235
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:44,560
Got me scared, whoo

1236
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:45,600
I'm-a need my bed

1237
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,033
I see shadows all on my wall

1238
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:48,599
Man, these monsters be big and tall

1239
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:50,352
Ghostbuster, who you gonna call?

1240
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,509
- Let's go.
- Let's go...

1241
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:52,776
- Oh. Did you want to...
- I'm sorry.

1242
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,256
- I'll let you. I'll let you.
- Next time.

1243
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,679
Whoo! They roll up to my house

1244
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,273
They knocking at my door

1245
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:58,918
They coming busting in

1246
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,069
Kill all them ghosts

1247
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,560
Something strange
in my neighborhood

1248
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,176
Look out the window
and it ain 't too good

1249
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,111
I smoke these ghosts
like Backwoods

1250
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,716
Are you the Ghostbusters?

1251
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,456
Actually, we're
the Conductors of the Metaphysical...

1252
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,471
We're... Yes. We're the Ghostbusters.

1253
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:23,552
"There's a chicken frying
itself in the library."

1254
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,756
- That is strange.
- That is not what he said.

1255
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,592
Please, follow me.

1256
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,671
Right away. Please, all of you.

1257
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:34,713
Fernando was down here when something
crawled out of a wall vent, and...

1258
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:37,070
I heard him screaming, so I went to check,

1259
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:41,517
and that's when the "thing" was
tossing Fernando all around the room.

1260
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:44,638
I thought it was gonna kill him.
I shrieked when I saw it. I...

1261
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:48,515
I guess I scared it, because I'm told
that I have a very disturbing scream.

1262
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:49,920
I could see that.

1263
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,753
Anyway, if you could just mosey around,
you'll probably bump into it.

1264
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:53,909
'Kay, girls?

1265
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:56,589
All right. Well, we know
it's down here somewhere.

1266
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:59,558
Let's split up, and if you see anything,
get on the walkie.

1267
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:01,960
Roger.

1268
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:08,791
Separate from innocence
The morals we've been fed

1269
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,630
Holtzmann! This is serious!

1270
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:24,154
And I agree. We all agree.

1271
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,753
Except for Kathy. She doesn't get it.

1272
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,159
All right, come on.

1273
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:49,674
Guys, I think I got
another one of those devices.

1274
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,736
I just thought
this was gonna be like a book club.

1275
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,830
Play some Stevie Nicks albums, you know?

1276
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,152
'Cause I'm telling you right now,
if I see two twins from The Shining,

1277
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,240
I'm gonna pass out.

1278
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:02,628
Okay, yep.

1279
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,316
Room full of nightmares.
Not going in there.

1280
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,868
I don't understand
how I get wrapped up in this stuff.

1281
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,111
I had a good job at the MTA.

1282
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:12,595
Was it perfect?

1283
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,536
No, of course it wasn't perfect.

1284
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:17,472
But I tell you what, everybody was alive.

1285
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:21,953
Was that there before?

1286
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,198
Please do not answer.

1287
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,599
I said, don't answer!

1288
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:31,875
Okay...

1289
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:36,080
Oh!

1290
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:38,880
Hi.

1291
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,998
It's a full paranormal
transferal embodiment.

1292
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:45,231
Erin, all of our theories
on spectral possession are true.

1293
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:48,075
There's a ghost in that thing,
and I want it.

1294
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,195
Let's light 'em up!

1295
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:54,949
Whoa...

1296
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,438
Run! We're gonna lose it! Come on!

1297
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,033
- I love your fire!
- Oh, man.

1298
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,400
Ugh!

1299
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,913
Upstairs! Go, go, go! Come on!

1300
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,600
Huh! Why fear what's around you?

1301
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,600
It could be everything you dreamed
And it's about to be true

1302
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:23,668
Ooh, yeah

1303
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:27,077
Come with the one who wants to
drag you away from the shore

1304
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:29,080
'Cause you're looking for more

1305
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:30,798
You want some more

1306
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,277
That's not mine!

1307
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:38,576
I think those machines
are making them stronger!

1308
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:39,999
That thing is super ionized!

1309
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,559
And super not-benign!

1310
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:44,200
This music is so terrible,
it's making him more angry.

1311
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,679
Play something gentle!

1312
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:48,874
Behold the power of the undead!

1313
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,515
We have summoned Satan himself!

1314
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,911
For we are the kings of all...

1315
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,791
- Let's do this!
- Go, go.

1316
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:21,108
This auditorium is Art Deco, you idiots!

1317
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:22,913
Aim for the ghost!

1318
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:28,199
Hey, Patty, you take that aisle.
I'll take the far one.

1319
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:31,317
Okay, I need y'all to get out the way!
We need to get up those aisles!

1320
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,000
All right, move, people!
I need to get down that aisle!

1321
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:36,776
If you're not gonna move,
you're gonna become part of this operation!

1322
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,518
All right, heads up!

1323
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:40,589
Come on! Move me left!

1324
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,317
Oh! Ooh! Watch the rings.
Watch the rings.

1325
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,913
Okay, you sweaty freaks.

1326
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,036
I'm 'bout to save you from this ghost!

1327
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:51,400
Ooh.

1328
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:56,679
Okay, so I don't know if it was a race thing
or a lady thing, but I'm mad as hell.

1329
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:58,432
- Pick me up!
- All right, put me down!

1330
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:00,988
Put me down! Down, down, thank you.

1331
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:04,440
Okay, Patty, stay still!

1332
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,715
- You have sort of a...
- Okay, I just...

1333
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:08,496
I don't need you to tell me
anything right now.

1334
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,795
- No, no, no... You got a...
- Nope.

1335
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:13,599
I really need you not to tell me
anything right now.

1336
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:15,830
- But, Patty, there...
- Hey. I'm tired.

1337
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:17,016
- No, no, no...
- Listen...

1338
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:18,496
I'm just gonna go ahead and take off,
how about that?

1339
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:20,636
No, no, no,
I don't really think that's a good idea.

1340
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,950
- Going to take off...
- Come on, Patty. Patty!

1341
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:27,079
And I don't want to piss off the ghost.

1342
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:31,439
Moving, going back to my booth at the MTA,

1343
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:33,715
so let me know if you need some MetroCards.

1344
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,520
- Do it, do it, do it.
- 'Cause I am...

1345
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:36,760
Really?

1346
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,153
All right, ladies, light 'em up!

1347
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,117
Patty, stay still.

1348
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:41,838
Just don't hit Patty anywhere important.

1349
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:43,148
- What?
- Nothing!

1350
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:48,588
Oh, you gonna get it now!

1351
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:54,909
Erin, I forgot to tell you, don't let
your beam get entangled with my beam.

1352
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:57,270
- What? Why?
- It's too much power.

1353
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:58,696
It would cause a counter reaction.

1354
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:02,269
The beam would shoot back into your body,
and each atom will implode.

1355
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:04,555
- What!
- Holtz, open that trap!

1356
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:05,795
Okay.

1357
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:08,314
And I'm gonna open it on three.

1358
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:09,833
- Holtzmann!
- Ready?

1359
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:11,673
- Sweetie!
- Two...

1360
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,876
- Open the box!
- And one. Okay!

1361
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:19,916
Erin, doing great. Abby, doing great.

1362
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,797
Patty, try a little harder, okay?

1363
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:23,552
Get in the box, you hellion!

1364
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:27,278
Come on, we got you!

1365
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:28,395
Come on.

1366
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:37,795
Whew!

1367
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:39,336
Excuse me, gotta get...
Excuse me, excuse me.

1368
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:40,640
I got a ghost to get. Thank you.

1369
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:49,109
Did we just catch a ghost?

1370
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,235
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1371
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:52,038
We put a ghost in a box!

1372
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:57,235
You want some more,
you want some more?

1373
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:58,560
Yes!

1374
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,670
What you're looking for
You want some more...

1375
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:01,760
Right in there!

1376
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:04,877
We are the Beasts of Mayhem! Huh!

1377
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:12,996
Sorry, can't buy you another one.

1378
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:14,115
Yeah!

1379
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:21,029
Wankers! Black Sabbath
did that shit in '74.

1380
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:23,711
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!

1381
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:25,233
- My gosh.
- Thanks so much.

1382
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:26,958
Why are there ghosts in New York?

1383
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:29,600
We made magic today,
and that's all I got to say. I'm Holtzmann.

1384
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,398
Where are these ghosts coming from?

1385
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:34,656
Are there any more ghosts
inside the theater?

1386
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,159
I think we took it out.

1387
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:37,240
Listen, we're scientists.

1388
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:40,835
We're here for the unanswerable questions
and, really, to pursue truth.

1389
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,148
We're the Ghostbusters!

1390
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:43,673
Yeah!

1391
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:48,149
Nope. I had him yesterday.

1392
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:49,435
So?

1393
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:50,800
So, it's your turn.

1394
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:52,880
Weirdo city.

1395
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:54,913
Charge the lines.

1396
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,352
Create the vortex.

1397
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:59,518
Break the barrier.

1398
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:02,990
Enjoy your fun, Ghostbusters.

1399
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:06,717
For soon, you shall bow down before me.

1400
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:12,638
Whoo! Y'all gon' make me
lose my mind

1401
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:14,716
Up in here, up in here

1402
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:17,109
Y'all gon' make me go all out

1403
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,668
Up in here, up in here

1404
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:21,512
Y'all gon' make me act a fool...

1405
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:22,600
There he is.

1406
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:24,591
Come on, Kevin. Let's go.

1407
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:25,715
U h-oh, Kev.

1408
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:26,869
Go, Kev.

1409
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,077
Go, Kev. Go, Kev.

1410
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:30,160
Go, Kev.

1411
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:31,792
- Ah.
- Uh-oh, Kev. Stop, Kev.

1412
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:33,393
- Watch it!
- Stop, Kev.

1413
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,318
- Watch it.
- Stop it, Kevin.

1414
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:36,936
You ain't rapped long enough
to be foolin ' with me

1415
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,313
And you?
You ain 't strong enough

1416
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,753
So whatever it is
you puffin ' on

1417
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:41,520
That got you thinkin '
that you Superman...

1418
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:42,915
Oh, please.

1419
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:47,233
Get it. Get it.

1420
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:49,536
This is so good.
We have to celebrate.

1421
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:51,536
- Come on! This is what...
- You're right, you're right.

1422
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:53,073
- Yep.
- ...legit feels like.

1423
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:54,160
- Right here. This.
- Yep.

1424
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:55,434
Oh, my God.

1425
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,071
You have to stop kissing this.

1426
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:01,197
That... It just makes me feel
so warm and tingly inside.

1427
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:03,032
That's probably the radiation.

1428
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:07,360
Hey, guys, I got some pretty cool stuff
cooking up over here,

1429
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,356
if you want to just turn your head.

1430
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:13,513
I got some newly printed circuit boards,
and I rebuilt the superconducting magnets.

1431
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:14,828
I improved beam accuracy

1432
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:17,150
by adding a plasma shield
to the RF discharge chamber.

1433
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:19,396
I have cryocooler to
reduce helium boil-off,

1434
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:23,155
and to top it all off,
we got a freakin' Faraday cage

1435
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:25,356
to attenuate RF noise and avoid quenching.

1436
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:28,509
- Nice!
- All right!

1437
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:30,556
There's a Smartin Christ here to see you.

1438
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:33,639
Smartin Christ?

1439
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,990
Wait, are you saying "Martin Heiss"?

1440
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:37,559
- Doctor...
- No. No.

1441
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:39,856
Dr. Martin Heiss, the famed scientist
and paranormal debunker?

1442
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:41,920
- He's in this building right now?
- Yeah, that guy.

1443
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,952
Okay, you tell him that we're not here.

1444
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:47,031
- Wait, what? What?
- I don't want to talk to him.

1445
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:48,120
They're not here.

1446
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:49,873
Oh...

1447
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,390
Dr. Heiss, hello. Welcome.
Dr. Erin Gilbert.

1448
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:57,712
Is this a good time, Doctor,
or is this dinner rush?

1449
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,320
Why don't you call
and make an appointment?

1450
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:01,594
It's actually a perfect time.

1451
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:05,878
We were just
doing some experiments over here.

1452
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:07,715
Ah.

1453
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,558
Yes, please, have a seat.

1454
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:10,993
Let's start light and easy.

1455
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:17,075
Why are you pretending to catch ghosts?

1456
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:21,791
You know, it's really easy
to just sit there and be the naysayer,

1457
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:23,677
when you don't actually do anything.

1458
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:27,639
You know that we only comprehend
about 4% of the universe.

1459
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:28,994
4%!

1460
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:31,674
- Across the board! It's four!
- Abby, Abby...

1461
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:35,513
We all believe in the scientific method.

1462
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:37,318
I've dedicated my life to it.

1463
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:41,919
And we have actually done it.

1464
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:44,795
Today, at 4:32 p. m.,

1465
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:49,237
we successfully trapped a Class 3 vapor.

1466
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:50,469
You're telling me

1467
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:52,679
there is a ghost

1468
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,477
inside that thermos?

1469
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:57,596
- In that can?
- Don't touch it. Don't touch it.

1470
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,318
Booyah. Emphasis on the "boo."

1471
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:01,591
Well, I would love to see that.
I really would.

1472
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:04,917
Shoot. You know what?
You're not gonna get that treat today.

1473
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,629
We're still assessing what type
of containment method we're gonna use.

1474
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:11,678
We're testing the lab... In the...

1475
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:16,318
So, till we figure out
how to best keep the entity,

1476
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:18,788
that's not gonna happen.

1477
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,313
How's that for my timing?

1478
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:21,913
I come.

1479
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,309
You've caught a ghost. I can't see it.

1480
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,994
Look, I know it probably
sounds like we're making this up.

1481
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:29,156
- Yeah.
- It sounds crazy,

1482
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:33,119
and we probably don't really look like
legitimate scientists.

1483
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,634
No, you only lack the proper equipment,

1484
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:38,871
like a garbage truck
to hang on to the back of.

1485
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,595
Said the guy with
the walking stick and the floppy hat.

1486
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:44,875
It was my mother's.

1487
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:46,714
Yeah, that is an awesome hat.

1488
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:47,800
All right, man.

1489
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:49,440
Thanks for stopping by.

1490
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,230
Well, I guess the graciousness has run out.

1491
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:54,795
You want to see it?

1492
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:57,872
I would love to see it.

1493
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:59,075
Well, he can't see it.

1494
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:01,515
I'm going to show it to you, then.
How about that?

1495
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,511
- Gear up, you guys.
- No, you're not. Don't.

1496
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:07,273
Excuse me. Why are you doing this?

1497
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:08,839
Because he doesn't believe us.

1498
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:11,674
Erin. Come on,
we have finally succeeded

1499
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:14,560
at doing the thing that we have talked
about since we were little kids.

1500
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:16,909
And you want to risk it all, what, for him?

1501
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,752
Who cares if you impress him?

1502
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:21,440
Oh, golly, you two are something.

1503
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:23,349
You're right. I'm sorry.

1504
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:24,953
- I don't...
- Okay.

1505
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:26,416
- I don't know what I was thinking.
- All right.

1506
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:27,589
It's okay.

1507
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:31,235
Attagirl!

1508
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:32,400
Sorry. I did it. I'm sorry.

1509
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:33,576
- My God!
- I know!

1510
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:34,600
Casper?

1511
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:40,629
Aw, man!

1512
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:42,951
Hey, that man went out the wrong door.

1513
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:46,959
Oh, my God.

1514
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:52,751
He wasn't really Ghostbusters material.

1515
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:54,576
Who threw him out the window?

1516
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:56,716
A ghost threw him out the window.

1517
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,176
Oh, you mean like Patrick Swayze?

1518
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:00,056
Like, he's sitting behind you,
making some pottery?

1519
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:01,832
Yeah. Like Patrick Swayze.

1520
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:05,230
That's it. Then we were all dancing
at a summer camp in the Catskills.

1521
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:07,311
And then we sat down,
and he was behind me,

1522
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:08,400
and we made a vase.

1523
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:09,696
Oh, you're combining the two...

1524
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:11,416
- I combined a couple of Swayze movies.
- Yeah.

1525
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:12,776
Oh, you know what was a good one?
Road House.

1526
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,074
I loved Road House.

1527
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:15,240
- Point Break.
- He was a...

1528
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:16,355
Oh, Point Break.

1529
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:17,936
Come on. At the end with the big wave?

1530
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:19,080
He was a ghost in that, too!

1531
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:20,416
Well, you don't know
if he dies at the end.

1532
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:22,880
He doesn't die.
He doesn't die. They don't say he dies.

1533
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:24,114
Well, now what?

1534
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:27,656
- Who are you guys?
- Official business.

1535
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:29,080
We'll take it from here. Thank you.

1536
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:30,456
- What?
- You need to come with us.

1537
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:31,480
- What?
- Why?

1538
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:32,794
The mayor needs a word, ladies.

1539
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:43,835
So it's tandem parachuting.
So you'd be with an instructor.

1540
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:45,400
The little spoon.

1541
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:48,119
- And who is on top?
- The instructor.

1542
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:49,360
Nah.

1543
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:51,400
Oh.

1544
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:53,599
- Mayor.
- Oh!

1545
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:55,875
Hey! There you are.

1546
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,753
Welcome. Sorry for the mess
and for the drama.

1547
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,717
Please, come sit down. Take that one.

1548
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,896
Good. That's right.
And, you, that's a good one for you.

1549
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:05,354
And take the end seat. Good.

1550
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:07,800
That's not so good.

1551
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:09,598
No feet on the table, please.

1552
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:11,160
Um, sir, we don't have a lot of time.

1553
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:12,434
- And we're not frauds.
- No.

1554
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:13,936
- We are legitimate scientists.
- Let me interrupt you.

1555
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:15,393
We know you're not frauds,

1556
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,994
because we have been monitoring
this situation quite closely.

1557
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:21,231
Agents Hawkins and Rorke
are with Homeland Security.

1558
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:25,393
So we've been investigating
this extremely quietly.

1559
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:28,030
- Okay.
- So, what do you know?

1560
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:31,359
Um, we believe that someone
is creating a device

1561
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,749
that attracts and amplifies
paranormal activity.

1562
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,956
And that activity can be escalating now

1563
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:38,508
and giving us an even larger scale event.

1564
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,556
"Larger scale." Well, that sounds terrible.

1565
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:43,536
Okay, well,
you've been doing great work. Well done.

1566
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:45,869
We really appreciate it,
but it's time to knock it off.

1567
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:48,312
- What?
- Knock it off.

1568
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:51,312
No, I heard you and I see the hand gesture.
What does...

1569
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:53,696
These gentlemen are on it.
Let the government do their work.

1570
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:58,271
We're just worried that you all
are drawing a lot of attention...

1571
01:11:58,360 --> 01:11:59,873
- Exactly.
- ...to yourselves.

1572
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,035
What?

1573
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:03,031
- Patty does wear big earrings.
- Patty.

1574
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:07,194
Well, if it's a crime to look good,
guilty as charged.

1575
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:10,511
Other than that, I feel like
we keep a very low profile.

1576
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:12,192
You drive a hearse with a ghost on it,

1577
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:14,748
and you use a distinctly
un-American-sounding siren.

1578
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:15,840
We do.

1579
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,616
Do you have any idea
how many federal regulations

1580
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:19,153
you're breaking on a daily basis?

1581
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:20,593
- One?
- No.

1582
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:22,672
- Two?
- No.

1583
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:23,760
Is it one?

1584
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,398
Just sit quietly.

1585
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:26,976
Here's the essence
of the deal.

1586
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,912
We are gonna have to
make the public believe

1587
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,319
that you are frauds.

1588
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:33,352
- What? Wait. Why?
- What?

1589
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:35,874
The human brain, you know,
it can only handle so much.

1590
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:39,032
If everybody knew what was going on,
you know, there'd be a panic.

1591
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:43,750
So, we need to get the information out there
that the incident at the concert was a hoax.

1592
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:47,153
'Cause, otherwise,
there'd be mass hysteria.

1593
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:50,473
Uh, we don't want mass hysteria either.

1594
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:53,358
Our main concern is that
we're allowed to continue our work.

1595
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:56,159
- Yes, that is very important.
- Very important.

1596
01:12:56,240 --> 01:13:03,078
But my concern is, I feel like the cat is
sort of already kind of out of the bag.

1597
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:06,550
I think what they're saying is
the cat is out of the bag.

1598
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:10,110
They want us to put the cat
back inside the bag.

1599
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,336
No, I know that's what they're saying.

1600
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:13,456
- But I'm saying the cat's already out.
- I know. I know it's out.

1601
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:15,296
- So it's hard to put the cat back in.
- It's not impossible.

1602
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:17,296
- But that's why they have that saying.
- It's a nonsense saying.

1603
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:19,056
If the cat is outta the bag,
you can't put it back in!

1604
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:20,136
I put a cat in a bag all the time.

1605
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:21,216
But once the cat is out of the bag,

1606
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:22,456
aren't you like,
"Ooh! The cat is out of the bag!"

1607
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:24,520
We just want to
shove that damn cat back in the bag.

1608
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,397
The cat has been out of the bag before,

1609
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,994
and yet, people lose interest
and put it back in.

1610
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:30,469
People always move on.

1611
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:33,711
Sheriff in New Mexico
reports a UFO encounter.

1612
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:37,076
The crew of the SS Ourang Medan
dies mysteriously.

1613
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:40,675
The entire town of Langville, Montana,
goes missing.

1614
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:42,194
It does?

1615
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:43,315
Okay, but he...

1616
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:45,312
We're talking about relocating.

1617
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:48,591
No one's being killed here, right?

1618
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,752
They were turned inside out.

1619
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:53,229
Their skin is on the inside of their body?

1620
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:57,518
Their skin is on the inside of their body
because their organs are on the outside.

1621
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,194
But they're okay, right?

1622
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:00,755
Sure.

1623
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:02,678
I think they're dead.

1624
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,801
On that horrifying note,
thank you all so much for coming.

1625
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:09,760
Call this number if you have any more info.

1626
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:13,793
When it comes to these ghosts,
we'll take it from here.

1627
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:16,176
The US government
doesn't need the help of hobbyists, okay?

1628
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:19,397
So go back upstairs to
your little dim sum tea party, okay?

1629
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:22,711
And leave it to us. We're the big dogs.

1630
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:30,394
- Hey, come on, man.
- I'm sorry. Sorry.

1631
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:33,400
Meatheads.

1632
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:37,554
- Unlock it. Unlock it.
- Okay, wait. Hold on.

1633
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:46,639
Roll your window up.

1634
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:48,240
I'm watching you.

1635
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:52,914
You think they got genitals in there?
Or is it more of a Ken doll situation?

1636
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:54,394
I'm watching you!

1637
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:57,229
I'm gonna go with Ken doll situation.

1638
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,000
It's smooth.

1639
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:01,516
We're watching you!

1640
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:05,828
Now, the mayor said we could
continue our work, and so we shall.

1641
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:06,989
We got to be prepared.

1642
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:09,958
That's why I've made a table of treats.

1643
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:11,760
Erin, you've had a hard day. Step right up.

1644
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,068
Pick a gun, any gun.

1645
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:15,189
No!

1646
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:16,878
I'm sorry, not that gun.

1647
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:18,916
That one's not ready.
It's yours when it is.

1648
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,353
Here, in the meantime...

1649
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:22,320
This.

1650
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:24,673
Wow! What does it do?

1651
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:26,318
It's a Swiss Army knife.

1652
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:28,436
No woman should walk around unarmed.

1653
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:30,079
I know what it does.

1654
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:32,509
- Also, here, why don't you take this.
- Yeah?

1655
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:34,598
Give that a toss.

1656
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:36,636
That's gonna send up a little poof.

1657
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:38,716
It's only dangerous to ghosts.

1658
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,153
- All right.
- Okay.

1659
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:45,155
Oh, nice!

1660
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:47,080
- Ooh!
- Oh!

1661
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:51,669
Yeah, my mistake.
It was a medium poof.

1662
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:53,996
This puppy I like to call a Ghost Chipper.

1663
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:57,993
Hollow-laser technology,
sucks in the ghost and neutralizes it.

1664
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:01,072
Step up to bat and do what you're gonna do.

1665
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:03,994
You truly scare me.
I just want to let you know that.

1666
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:07,679
I'm gonna just...

1667
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,433
- Oh...
- Come on!

1668
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:17,829
Oh, it's like Mardi Gras in there.

1669
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:19,478
It's a proton glove.

1670
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:22,757
It's gonna maximize flexibility
during hand-to-specter combat.

1671
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:24,910
Just give it a punch,
it's motion-activated.

1672
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:29,400
Ha-ha!

1673
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:38,520
Okay. That...

1674
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:39,953
...was awesome!

1675
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:46,671
- No, that is a deadly high five.
- No.

1676
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:48,113
- No.
- Hey, ladies,

1677
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:50,395
I'd call this a successful test.

1678
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:54,953
It's fraudulent and unsafe, frankly.

1679
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:59,113
You know, these Ghostbusters
are creating an unnecessary panic

1680
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:00,952
- in a sad grab for fame.
- It's fine.

1681
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:03,429
People can rest assured
that these women are fake.

1682
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:05,634
Oh!

1683
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:06,720
Damn.

1684
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:09,016
- Aw, my favorite acid.
- It's okay. I'll get it. I'll get it.

1685
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:10,040
Be careful.

1686
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,376
Hey, guys, I've been meaning to ask,

1687
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,856
what was that thing that threw that man
out the window the other day?

1688
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,677
Kevin, it was a ghost.

1689
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:19,354
- A ghost?
- Do you not know what goes on here, Kevin?

1690
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:20,589
Okay, I've got it.

1691
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:22,914
We sell the restaurant.

1692
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,672
Guys, we haven't had customers, anyway.

1693
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:27,638
It's time to face the facts,
the restaurant is not working.

1694
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:29,073
You're standing in the acid.

1695
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:31,256
- Ah, not my slippers.
- It's hydrochloric acid.

1696
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:33,157
Get the baking soda. There you go.

1697
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:34,992
That's how you clean up hydrochloric.

1698
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:36,080
Good boy.

1699
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:39,516
- Oh, God, it stinks.
- Just a big, beautiful dummy.

1700
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:42,512
Well, it's official.
We're all ghost girls now.

1701
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:44,115
Can't see.

1702
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:46,696
- Well, that's the acid.
- Get back to the eyewash station.

1703
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:49,439
- Where is that?
- Back by the bathroom. Left.

1704
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:50,560
There you go.

1705
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,838
Stop when you hit something.

1706
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,194
- Okay.
- Jesus.

1707
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:56,280
Good job.

1708
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:59,354
All right, I would like
to remind everybody here

1709
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:01,795
that in a very short amount of time,

1710
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:05,190
we have seen multiple
Class 4 malevolent apparitions.

1711
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:06,475
- Yeah.
- We did.

1712
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:08,437
Who cares what anybody else
is saying about us?

1713
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:09,635
We know what we're doing.

1714
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:13,269
I mean, all morning,
I've been reading about this stuff.

1715
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:14,736
There's sightings all over the city.

1716
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:17,593
"Wailing spirit sighted at 6th and 26th."

1717
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:21,116
Another one,
"Spectral polar bear on 63rd and 5th."

1718
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:24,431
Then there was that weeping wall
in the thrift store at Chelsea.

1719
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:29,674
- Wait. Did you say 6th and 26th?
- Yeah. "Wailing spirits, 6th and 26th."

1720
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:33,230
6th and 26th. 6th and 26th. Okay.

1721
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:34,514
6th and 26th.

1722
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:39,798
Um, Aldridge Mansion. Um, Upper West Side.
Yes? 70... 72nd.

1723
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:41,296
Um, where did we find the first device?

1724
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:43,959
- Uh, at the subway, right here.
- Okay.

1725
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:45,553
Theater. Downtown. Downtown.

1726
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:47,312
- Downtown?
- Yes, yes. In here.

1727
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:48,856
Okay, what was the other address you said?

1728
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:51,314
Polar bear on 63rd and 5th Avenue.

1729
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:52,799
And the one in Chelsea?

1730
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:56,668
- Uh... Chelsea is at 10th Avenue and 18th.
- 18th. 10th and 18th.

1731
01:18:57,480 --> 01:18:58,480
Uh.

1732
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:10,034
What do those look like to you?

1733
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:13,278
Oh, It's an "X."
Touching other little "X's."

1734
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:14,759
- Ley lines.
- Ley lines.

1735
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:15,989
What's "ley lines"?

1736
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:19,789
It's a hidden network of energy lines
that run across the Earth.

1737
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:22,075
It's a current of supernatural energy.

1738
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:25,720
Supposedly, if you look at sacred
sites and weird events all over the world,

1739
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:27,990
and connect them with lines
where they intersect,

1740
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:30,640
it's an unusually powerful spot.

1741
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:31,936
Abby and I just dismissed this theory

1742
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:34,918
because it just seemed
too random to have any merit.

1743
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,632
Dismiss this.

1744
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:42,077
Okay. That looks like it's got some merit.

1745
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:46,229
He's using the devices
to charge the ley lines.

1746
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:50,150
- He's creating a vortex.
- A vortex.

1747
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:51,829
Oh, boy.

1748
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:55,117
Okay, if he gets one of his machines
in there and it's big enough,

1749
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:58,056
he's gonna be able
to rip a hole right through that barrier.

1750
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:00,230
Letting whatever's on this plane

1751
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:03,710
come crashing down on this plane.

1752
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:05,358
Okay, I'm calling this in.

1753
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:12,316
Okay, um, that intersection right there
between 7th and 8th.

1754
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,436
What is there now?

1755
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:18,559
- The Mercado.
- Mercado. It's Spanish for "table."

1756
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:20,676
The Mercado? That actually makes sense.

1757
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:23,593
Okay, yes, I'm looking
for Agents Hawkins and Rorke.

1758
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:26,240
The Mercado has
one of the weirdest histories

1759
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:27,514
of the buildings in New York.

1760
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:30,040
Okay, so it's your
standard-issue haunted building.

1761
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:32,310
No. This is even before it was a building.

1762
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:34,914
All sorts of massacres
happened at that spot.

1763
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,709
Like the peaceful trade between
the Lenape Indians and Captain Warren.

1764
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,711
Then, all of a sudden, everybody dies.

1765
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:43,792
Oh, my God, you guys.
This is the dude that was at the subway

1766
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:45,996
that was talking about the cataclysms!
This is him!

1767
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:47,755
Oh.

1768
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:49,592
It's always the sad, pale ones.

1769
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:52,274
Okay, ladies, let's gear up
and hit that Mercado.

1770
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:00,114
Who's in the mood to save New York City?

1771
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:28,870
And did you try adjusting
the thermostat before placing this call?

1772
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:31,997
Well, I'm terribly sorry
that you have a draft in your room.

1773
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:35,516
Why don't you hold while I connect you
to someone who might care.

1774
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:38,194
- Hi. Excuse me.
- Hold on.

1775
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:40,350
- What do you want?
- Where's your janitor?

1776
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:42,874
Oh, that nut-job! What has he done...

1777
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,558
I don't want to know.

1778
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:47,916
Just take the stairs down and get him out.

1779
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:20,316
Hey, stop right there!

1780
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:21,833
Shut it down!

1781
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:22,920
Ah.

1782
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:25,679
The Ghostbusters.

1783
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:28,513
Look, I think it's great
you found yourself a little hobby,

1784
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:31,398
and I'm sure, on paper,
flooding New York City with ghosts

1785
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:32,799
seemed like a great idea,

1786
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:35,314
but we happen to like the
world the way it is.

1787
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:39,154
Then you must've been afforded the basic
dignity and respect of a human being,

1788
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:40,355
which I have been denied.

1789
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:41,759
Not really.

1790
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:43,796
People dump on us pretty much all the time.

1791
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:48,558
I am a genius.
I see things that no one else does.

1792
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:52,872
And for it, I am rewarded
with nothing but scorn and mockery.

1793
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:56,236
Luckily, I am not
the only one seeking revenge.

1794
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,231
Behind these are millions of souls,

1795
01:22:58,320 --> 01:22:59,833
souls which have been cast aside.

1796
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:04,596
Souls who see the world
as it truly is, as garbage.

1797
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:06,750
Garbage that needs to be cleaned up.

1798
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:08,639
They're mostly dudes.

1799
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:10,916
When these barriers are destroyed,

1800
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:15,073
an army of the undead
will return to pester the living.

1801
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:18,197
"Pester the living"
doesn't sound so bad.

1802
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:22,872
They will return to pester the living
with unspeakable pain and torment.

1803
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:27,994
Children will be pestered limb from limb
in front of their own parents.

1804
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:31,709
The parents will be pestered in half
and pestered in half again.

1805
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:36,078
And pestered into the ground until their
bloody, pulpy bodies are nothing but meat.

1806
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:39,836
That's a different, uh, definition of
"pester" than what I was thinking.

1807
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:43,196
I think the word we're looking for
is apocalypse. Apocalypse.

1808
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:47,068
Well, let's get these barriers destroyed,
shall we?

1809
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:50,195
Uh, uh, uh, uh, wait, wait, wait! Rowan.

1810
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:54,512
I get it. You don't like people.
People can be terrible.

1811
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:58,229
The thing is, though,
there's so many terrific things out there.

1812
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:02,233
I mean, wonderful things
that are worth living for.

1813
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:05,312
I mean, you got soup,

1814
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:10,235
and, you know, that first...
You know when...

1815
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:13,437
Oh, God. I can only think of soup.
Anybody? Somebody? Patty?

1816
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:14,669
- Salad.
- Salad.

1817
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:16,496
- Whoa, whoa!
- No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait!

1818
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:17,999
Okay, stop what you're doing.

1819
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:19,593
The police are already on their way.

1820
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:22,399
It's over. You're going to jail, Rowan.

1821
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:24,789
Well, in that case,

1822
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,035
bye.

1823
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:38,440
That's a weird move.

1824
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:39,794
Oh, he dead. That's a dead man.

1825
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:41,916
See if you can shut that thing down.

1826
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:47,632
- Come on!
- Holtz?

1827
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:50,789
Holtz, are we good?

1828
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:54,589
Uh... Well, he's not,
but, yeah, we're okay.

1829
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:56,750
Okay. Well, that's over.

1830
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:59,308
Okay, we're down here! Down here!

1831
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:01,072
You hate to see the smart ones go bad.

1832
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:05,112
Man, it smells like burned bologna
and regrets down here.

1833
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:07,634
Like, um, the dude that worked here,

1834
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:10,598
he, like, dressed, like,
in a Captain Kirk-type outfit.

1835
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:12,256
- What's up?
- He was, like, standing over here...

1836
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:13,395
I don't know. It's strange.

1837
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:16,278
You know, his technology's
not that different from ours.

1838
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:19,477
It's basically, like, we're
both using the same science.

1839
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:21,630
- That is strange.
- I think I know why.

1840
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:25,673
Look what Mr. Cuckoo Pants
has been reading at the beach. No.

1841
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:26,829
Oh, my God.

1842
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:29,832
I told you that there would be
people out there that loved our work.

1843
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:32,696
Why am I so flattered that that weird
little sociopath bought our book?

1844
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:36,998
Oh, thank you for everything you did.
You saved us all.

1845
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:38,593
The mayor thanks you, of course.

1846
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:40,989
Privately, so don't tell anyone.

1847
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:42,080
Um... Can I walk you out?

1848
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:44,270
Well, why don't you all go get some rest?

1849
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:46,999
These gentlemen here
will get you out of here. Okay?

1850
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:48,296
- Oh, thank you. That's very nice.
- All right.

1851
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:51,039
- Thanks for all you've done, ladies.
- Thank you very much.

1852
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:53,190
I just have to say
a couple things to the press.

1853
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:54,508
You know how that goes.

1854
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:56,716
So we just are gonna fake-arrest you now.

1855
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:59,553
Oh, and we towed your car.
Real-tow, not fake-tow.

1856
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:00,776
- Ms. Lynch!
- What's that?

1857
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:02,480
- Ms. Lynch!
- What? Wait, why?

1858
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:03,520
Ow!

1859
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:04,736
- Excuse me!
- Stop resisting.

1860
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:06,876
I'm not. I'm walking with you.

1861
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:09,315
- Is New York in trouble?
- Everything is fine.

1862
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:15,839
It was just another publicity stunt
by these incredibly sad and lonely women.

1863
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:18,559
It's like they read Eat, Pray, Love
and just ran with it.

1864
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:38,910
Well, mission accomplished, ladies.

1865
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,560
I say we get some drinks and celebrate.

1866
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:43,551
How about it, Erin? It's my treat.

1867
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:45,358
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1868
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:47,032
A couple quick questions for my blog.

1869
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:51,398
First, how does it feel wasting
tax payer money and government resources

1870
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:52,879
with your pranks?

1871
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:55,952
Uh, why don't you go back to
your mother's basement where you live?

1872
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:58,836
Yeah, I plan to, after this.

1873
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:01,036
Ms. Gilbert, I asked around your hometown.

1874
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:02,856
I talked to somebody
you went to school with.

1875
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:05,110
They said when you were a kid,
you made up a ghost.

1876
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:08,835
So, tell me,
were you born a fraud, ghost girl?

1877
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:10,595
Don't call me that!

1878
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:12,193
Erin! Oh, my God!

1879
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:13,872
Erin, he's too pasty to fight.

1880
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:15,712
Erin, you're making us look bad right now.

1881
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,791
Erin, come on, let it go.

1882
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:19,996
They should put you back in therapy,
you freak.

1883
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:22,160
Oh!

1884
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:24,120
Oh, damn!

1885
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Hey.

1886
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:31,716
Guess whose desk I just set on fire.

1887
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:33,199
You'll never guess.

1888
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:37,159
You may guess when you see
your desk later. Okay.

1889
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:38,416
All right. Just read it. Just read it.

1890
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:40,078
"Midtown movie theater owner claims

1891
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:44,438
"Basset Hound
regularly attends matinees by himself."

1892
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:46,192
- Look at his ears.
- Yes, I see.

1893
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:47,320
I meant the one about me.

1894
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:49,240
- Oh.
- Yes.

1895
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:54,712
It's devastating.

1896
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:56,109
Oh, look, you're on TV.

1897
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:57,553
We spoke to Dr. Harold Filmore,

1898
01:27:57,640 --> 01:27:59,949
Physics Department Chair
at Columbia University,

1899
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:01,439
where Ms. Gilbert used to teach.

1900
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:02,520
Oh, no, no.

1901
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:06,155
It's unfortunate that we have
these former ties with Ms. Gilbert.

1902
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:10,995
Here at Columbia University,
we 're about real science, discovering truth,

1903
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:13,950
not lying for a sad moment of fame.

1904
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:16,793
You know what?
They don't know what they're talking about.

1905
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:20,080
We also spoke with the
Dean of the Kenneth P. Higgins Institute.

1906
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:21,160
Oh, God.

1907
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:25,193
Ms. Gilbert's association with the
Kenneth P. Higgins Institute, albeit distant,

1908
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:27,117
is a blight on this university.

1909
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:31,318
But, good news,
I have an album dropping in two weeks.

1910
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:34,360
It's called I'm ma Be Me, and I wouldn
't mind playing you the title track.

1911
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:36,391
Ha!

1912
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:37,800
God.

1913
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:39,313
Yo, Erin, shake that off.

1914
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:40,696
You know how many lives you saved?

1915
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:42,696
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we gotta get out there.

1916
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:45,314
We gotta get something to eat.
We gotta find that Basset Hound.

1917
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:46,833
I'll just see you guys tomorrow.

1918
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:48,672
I gotta go. I'm sorry.

1919
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:50,392
- Erin...
- I'm sorry!

1920
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:52,550
So, Abby, I've been doing
a lot of thinking,

1921
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:56,116
and congratulations,
I've decided to become a Ghostbuster.

1922
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:59,829
Oh, God. I don't have time to try to
explain why that's not going to happen.

1923
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:05,510
I thought they would've
been happy about that.

1924
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:52,752
Did you guys lose your keys?

1925
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:56,674
What did I tell you? Pin it to your bra strap.
That's where mine is, and it...

1926
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:21,434
Who's out there?
Holtzmann, I swear to God, I...

1927
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:46,039
Don't look so surprised.

1928
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:50,237
You didn't think I was gone when
there's so much left to do, did you, Abby?

1929
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:52,957
It's brilliant, really.

1930
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:58,239
My devices energized spectral entities
on a nuclear, paramolecular level.

1931
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:00,760
Sound familiar?

1932
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:02,951
It's the reverse of your research.

1933
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:06,552
Do it in the right place, with enough power,
and there goes the barrier.

1934
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:10,190
And then the world shall bend to...

1935
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:14,759
Okay. I apologize.
That looks nastier than I intended.

1936
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:18,560
Enjoy, Abby!

1937
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:36,256
Ghostbusters. What do you want?

1938
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:39,640
Hello? Guys, it's me.
Are you there? Please pick up if you're there.

1939
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:40,896
Call me as soon as you get this.

1940
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:44,390
I think when Rowan killed himself,
it was just the next step in his plan.

1941
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:46,914
The mayor's itinerary has been set.

1942
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:51,232
Mayor Bradley is meeting with the diplomats
at Lotus Leaf this very moment.

1943
01:31:52,120 --> 01:31:53,473
Lotus Leaf.

1944
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:59,357
Abby! We got you a sandwich
so you don't be picking off of ours, man.

1945
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:02,318
You need some food.
Your moods have been real bad, yo.

1946
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:03,594
Come on now.

1947
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:06,069
Abby? You in there?

1948
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:10,279
Everything okay?

1949
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,355
Abby, come and get your sandwich

1950
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:15,317
Come and get your sandwich, please

1951
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:17,632
You want your little sandwich?

1952
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:20,199
Abby...

1953
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:21,599
Hello, Jillian.

1954
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:23,189
Hello, Abby.

1955
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:25,553
Are you okay?

1956
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:26,993
I'm quite well.

1957
01:32:27,560 --> 01:32:28,879
That's good.

1958
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:40,959
You found my pipe.

1959
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:42,473
I got it at the dumpster yesterday.

1960
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:45,548
I'm gonna use it to make a proton shotgun.

1961
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:46,959
Pretty cool, right?

1962
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:49,833
If it doesn't work, we can just
swing it around and break stuff,

1963
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:51,512
so it's kind of a win-win.

1964
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:54,194
- What?
- What are you doing?

1965
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:56,149
Not my babies!

1966
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:58,315
Hey!

1967
01:32:58,640 --> 01:32:59,993
- Wait a minute!
- No!

1968
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:01,399
Man, are y'all playing?

1969
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:04,193
'Cause this ain't funny, man. Yo! For real!

1970
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:06,589
See, Abby, I told you
to have that sandwich, man.

1971
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:08,113
Low blood sugar is serious!

1972
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:09,713
- Hello, Patricia.
- What?

1973
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:16,474
Abby!

1974
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:18,637
What the...

1975
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:19,835
Look at the view.

1976
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:23,079
This is fun, right?

1977
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:25,640
Good-bye.

1978
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:28,518
I got you, baby! I got you!

1979
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:44,271
- Oh, my God, help me.
- Hi, Patty.

1980
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:50,272
Hell no! The Devil is a liar!

1981
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:52,469
Boo.

1982
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:53,834
Hellion, begone!

1983
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:56,079
Oh, shit.

1984
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:57,789
Oh, no!

1985
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:01,710
Holtzy! Got you, Holtzy!

1986
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:04,429
No!

1987
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:06,715
Get out of my friend, ghost!

1988
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:08,995
Ow!

1989
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:13,511
Ow! That's gonna leave a mark!

1990
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:16,194
The power of Patty compels you!

1991
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:17,800
Ow!

1992
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:19,355
Is that you, Abby?

1993
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:20,475
Where did he go?

1994
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:21,913
Hey, guys, check it out!

1995
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:23,149
Hey, listen.

1996
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:25,993
I figured you're gonna need my help,
so I borrowed all this stuff.

1997
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:28,913
If you could just chuck me down
my own proton pack, that'd be great.

1998
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,479
- Kevin, come inside!
- Kevin.

1999
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:31,736
- Come inside.
- I'm part of the team.

2000
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:32,976
I can help out.
I'm not gonna get in your way.

2001
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,194
- Come on, move!
- Move!

2002
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:35,896
I was born to be a Ghostbuster, all right?

2003
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:36,920
Nothing's gonna stop me!

2004
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:41,673
- Oh, man.
- Kevin!

2005
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:43,478
Come on, Rowan, get out of him!

2006
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:45,152
Thanks for the upgrade.

2007
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:47,079
Rowan, ya big bully!

2008
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:49,991
Hope this guy knows
how to ride a motorcycle.

2009
01:34:50,120 --> 01:34:51,348
Rowan, not Kevin!

2010
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:53,590
Yeah, he does.

2011
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:57,273
Oh, that's so not good.

2012
01:35:04,120 --> 01:35:06,776
No, no. It's just a magic trick.
He didn't actually cut her in half.

2013
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:09,216
- No, no. I was there. She was cut in half.
- There's two women.

2014
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:10,296
Yeah, I saw it.

2015
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:11,440
It's just a trick.

2016
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:12,840
Mayor Bradley, it's me!

2017
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:15,631
Who the shit is this?

2018
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:17,478
It's me! It's Erin.

2019
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:19,391
She thinks that's a sliding door.

2020
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:20,674
It's Erin. Hi!

2021
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:23,035
She thinks they're all doors. That's sad.

2022
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:24,553
She's a scientist.

2023
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:26,119
Mayor Bradley.

2024
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:28,319
You have to evacuate the city!

2025
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:29,480
Never say that word.

2026
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:30,936
You have to shut down the power
to the whole city!

2027
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:33,679
Don't you understand? He's using
the power to energize them!

2028
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:36,069
You know what, as you can see,
the mayor is very busy.

2029
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:37,309
Oh, no.

2030
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:38,515
It's happening.

2031
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,960
Can you hear it?

2032
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:43,674
It's...

2033
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:46,480
Oh, um...

2034
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:48,068
Okay, that's a dumpster.

2035
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:50,469
But the undead are still arriving.

2036
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:51,976
Please, Mayor Bradley,
you have to believe me.

2037
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,576
You're the only one
that can do something. Don't...

2038
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:55,160
Please don't be like the mayor in Jaws.

2039
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:58,909
Never compare me to the Jaws mayor. Never!

2040
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,096
Please, you have to get everyone out.

2041
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:01,216
You're endangering everyone in the city!

2042
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:02,389
That took way too long.

2043
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:03,515
What are you doing?

2044
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:05,113
My... Get off of me!

2045
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,072
Mayor Bradley, you have to listen to me!

2046
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:11,038
Get out of the city! Get out of the city!

2047
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:12,673
They're coming!

2048
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:15,115
Don't you understand?
These ghosts kill people!

2049
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:25,957
50 cents a T-shirt.

2050
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:28,076
My plan is to wear a new one every day,

2051
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:31,436
and then just throw 'em out
and then start over every month, yeah.

2052
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:34,956
Whoa. Hey. Man,
nobody ordered a Clark Kent strippergram.

2053
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:36,234
Clark Kent?

2054
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:39,395
Oh, because of the glasses
and the handsomeness?

2055
01:36:50,120 --> 01:36:52,509
I should have worked out more
when I was alive.

2056
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:05,515
Oh, I definitely should
have worked out more.

2057
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:42,950
You have to get out of the city!

2058
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:45,757
Please! Get out!

2059
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:48,949
Oh, no.

2060
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:51,239
It's happening.

2061
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:13,960
Oh...

2062
01:38:45,080 --> 01:38:47,310
City College must have just let out, huh?

2063
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:50,520
Yankees suck!

2064
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:55,352
What the hell am I doing in New York?

2065
01:38:56,920 --> 01:38:59,150
- Let's do this.
- Oh, yeah.

2066
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:09,391
Taxi! Taxi!

2067
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:14,311
- Where you going?
- Chinatown.

2068
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:16,834
Nah. That's, like,
one more block south than I want to go.

2069
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:19,480
Sir, those are actual ghosts flying around!

2070
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:21,949
Eh, they're Class 5 floating vapors.
Nothing to worry about.

2071
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:24,296
No, no, no, it's important.
Don't you see what's happening?

2072
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:25,520
Look, I don't go to Chinatown,

2073
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:28,028
I don't drive wackos,
and I ain't afraid of no ghosts.

2074
01:39:28,120 --> 01:39:29,633
What? No, no, no, wait!

2075
01:39:30,120 --> 01:39:31,997
That's a double negative!

2076
01:39:32,280 --> 01:39:33,952
That means you are afraid of ghosts.

2077
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:36,711
Oh, God, I got to get my gear.

2078
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:47,632
Seem to have hit an impasse.

2079
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:49,119
Yeah, I'd say so.

2080
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:53,992
All right, let's clear a path.

2081
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:56,311
You guys,
this looks like my kitchen.

2082
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:11,200
What the hell is that thing?

2083
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:16,789
Ew.

2084
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:18,108
- Hey, hey!
- Wait!

2085
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:19,559
Oh, really?

2086
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:21,278
Did you leave the keys in the car?

2087
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:29,030
My uncle is gonna be pissed.

2088
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:34,952
- Okay, light him up!
- No, don't shoot.

2089
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:37,096
The equipment on top of that
is basically a nuclear reactor.

2090
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:39,350
- What?
- Okay, I vote we don't shoot at that.

2091
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:56,710
Well, we just gave a ghost a nuke.

2092
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:58,392
We should probably run.

2093
01:40:58,640 --> 01:40:59,640
Yep.

2094
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:02,750
Go! Go! Moving out!

2095
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:26,795
Yo, was Thanksgiving
like Halloween back in the 1920s?

2096
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:29,030
'Cause that's a creepy-ass Macy's Parade.

2097
01:41:29,120 --> 01:41:33,432
I don't know. I've always kind of been
attracted to husky men in hats.

2098
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:35,296
Uh-oh.

2099
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:36,958
I just made eye contact.

2100
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:39,120
- With the balloon?
- Yeah, straight down the barrel.

2101
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:45,194
- Oh, damn.
- I think we may look like chew toys to him.

2102
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:47,317
All right, let's pop some balloons!

2103
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:16,272
Oh, Lord, have mercy.

2104
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:18,197
This is just wrong!

2105
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:20,795
I can't move my hand.

2106
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:22,950
I can't reach the trigger.

2107
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:26,872
You guys, this is exactly
how I pictured my death.

2108
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:38,229
Come on.

2109
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:41,038
Proton guns are all well and good,

2110
01:42:41,120 --> 01:42:43,873
but sometimes you need the Swiss Army.

2111
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:46,838
Welcome back!

2112
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:49,071
- Am I shouting?
- Yeah.

2113
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:52,159
I think the balloon popped my ear!

2114
01:42:52,240 --> 01:42:56,836
All right, let's go save this city
and get our terrible receptionist back.

2115
01:42:56,920 --> 01:42:58,911
We're not gonna find
another one that pretty.

2116
01:43:13,400 --> 01:43:14,799
Who's the flying beefcake?

2117
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:18,440
Hello.

2118
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:23,038
Oh, dear brave men and women
of the protection services industry,

2119
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:26,193
I would like to see you dance.

2120
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:31,960
Get it off.

2121
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:33,240
I can't. It won't work anymore.

2122
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:36,030
My baby moves at midnight

2123
01:43:37,480 --> 01:43:39,516
Goes right on till the dawn

2124
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:42,831
I control all of you.

2125
01:43:45,120 --> 01:43:47,634
My woman keeps me warm

2126
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:55,150
What you doin ' on your back, aah?

2127
01:43:55,240 --> 01:43:56,434
Oh, this is fun.

2128
01:43:56,520 --> 01:43:59,398
You should be dancing, yeah

2129
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:04,432
Aw, women. Always late.

2130
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:08,428
Probably couldn't decide
which dirty jumpsuit to wear.

2131
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:12,399
Let's give 'em a proper New York welcome,
shall we?

2132
01:44:12,640 --> 01:44:13,640
Boop.

2133
01:44:15,240 --> 01:44:17,993
Welcome to the glory days of New York City.

2134
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:19,115
Have fun!

2135
01:44:32,640 --> 01:44:34,039
Never been good in a fight.

2136
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:35,749
Well, good news.

2137
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,637
Here's your chance to work on that.

2138
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:42,431
Guys,
you all have your sidearms.

2139
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:44,158
I suggest you use them.

2140
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:45,639
Okay, power up.

2141
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:06,473
Holtzy, get down! Get down!

2142
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:13,600
Slap shot!

2143
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:15,751
Gotcha.

2144
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:21,157
This isn't very Puritan behavior!

2145
01:45:25,080 --> 01:45:26,308
D'oh. Nuts!

2146
01:45:32,640 --> 01:45:33,914
I'm getting the hang of this!

2147
01:45:37,120 --> 01:45:38,120
Oh, shoot.

2148
01:45:38,200 --> 01:45:39,838
I lost my glasses!

2149
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:42,195
Wait, wait, I got 'em! They're in my hand!

2150
01:45:42,280 --> 01:45:43,349
A little help!

2151
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:53,635
Oh, impressive.

2152
01:45:57,120 --> 01:45:58,872
Holtzy! I got you!

2153
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:02,311
It's chipping time now, ghost.

2154
01:46:04,240 --> 01:46:06,595
And this is what you get for sitting on me!

2155
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,035
Missed me!

2156
01:46:09,120 --> 01:46:10,189
Thanks, Patty.

2157
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:23,240
Oh, not you guys again!

2158
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:27,192
Say hello to my little...

2159
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:31,319
What the hell?

2160
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:37,993
Forgot about my new toys.

2161
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:42,149
Let's go.

2162
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:12,195
You just got Holtzmanned, baby!

2163
01:47:12,720 --> 01:47:13,755
You know what?

2164
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:16,274
I'm glad I didn't know
any of you when you were alive,

2165
01:47:16,360 --> 01:47:18,635
'cause I don't enjoy any of you,
especially you.

2166
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:20,640
Okay. All right, Abby,
let's reel it in tighter.

2167
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:23,029
- I don't like you either!
- We got to save our energy.

2168
01:47:23,120 --> 01:47:24,599
Come on, let's go.

2169
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:28,955
Oh, my God, you killed a Pilgrim.

2170
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:30,719
It appears I did.

2171
01:47:39,160 --> 01:47:41,151
- This is weird.
- It sure is.

2172
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:43,236
Hey, why y'all like this?

2173
01:47:43,480 --> 01:47:44,959
Something's up, man.

2174
01:47:47,720 --> 01:47:49,517
Yeah, great work, fellas.

2175
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:51,158
Your country thanks you.

2176
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:03,239
Well, that thing's having
the time of its life.

2177
01:48:04,440 --> 01:48:05,475
Let's go.

2178
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:30,835
Oh, God.

2179
01:48:32,280 --> 01:48:34,635
It feels like the slime is after me,
personally.

2180
01:48:35,120 --> 01:48:36,394
That's all I'm saying.

2181
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:37,799
This might be a crazy hunch,

2182
01:48:37,880 --> 01:48:40,235
but I think he's got that machine
up and running again.

2183
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:42,635
Come on.

2184
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:49,799
Damn, I missed.

2185
01:48:50,080 --> 01:48:51,080
Oh, Kevin!

2186
01:48:51,320 --> 01:48:53,959
Oh. Is that what this thing's name is?

2187
01:48:54,040 --> 01:48:59,194
Thought it'd be something more Australian
like "Jack-O" or "Dave-O" or "Rob-O."

2188
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:01,794
Oh, I see there's five of you now.

2189
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:03,635
Huh?

2190
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:06,874
Who are you?

2191
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:08,552
Oh, I'm Frank.

2192
01:49:09,560 --> 01:49:11,391
I just came down to get some ice.

2193
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:13,393
Get out of here!

2194
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:15,159
Get out of here!

2195
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:23,549
I think we should've gave him a heads up
about what was going on out there, y'all.

2196
01:49:23,800 --> 01:49:26,268
Well, it's been a very long day.
Why don't you take a seat?

2197
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:28,800
Please, sit.

2198
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:29,995
Don't mind if I do.

2199
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:31,240
Whoop!

2200
01:49:32,160 --> 01:49:33,388
Ah!

2201
01:49:33,480 --> 01:49:34,480
Okay.

2202
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:37,237
I do appreciate the joke. It's a classic.

2203
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:38,639
Oh, for fun.

2204
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:41,434
I know you're getting real comfy
in your Kevin skin suit,

2205
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:42,873
but it's time you hop out.

2206
01:49:43,320 --> 01:49:46,949
We like him,
despite his many, many frustrating quirks.

2207
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:49,634
- He just started figuring out the phones!
- Yeah.

2208
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:51,669
Mmm... I don't know.

2209
01:49:53,160 --> 01:49:55,071
Is this a little too Peter Pan?

2210
01:49:55,440 --> 01:49:57,158
Anyway, I'll embrace it.

2211
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:01,656
You know, to be honest with you,

2212
01:50:01,680 --> 01:50:03,875
this guy's making me feel
stupider by the second.

2213
01:50:04,040 --> 01:50:05,040
He's all yours.

2214
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:06,955
- No!
- No, no, no!

2215
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:11,637
Don't let Rowan get away!

2216
01:50:11,720 --> 01:50:13,597
I got his ass! Here I am.

2217
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:17,870
Nobody hurts Kevin, man!
Nobody hurts Kevin!

2218
01:50:17,960 --> 01:50:20,872
Come out, come out wherever you are

2219
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:21,995
Over here.

2220
01:50:24,080 --> 01:50:25,416
Those guns come with instructions?

2221
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:28,716
Come on, Rowan! Come get your virginity
out of the lost-and-found!

2222
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:30,597
- You shoot like girls.
- 12 o'clock!

2223
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:39,515
I think you broke it.

2224
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:40,919
Look what you made me do!

2225
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:42,638
It's ridiculous. Let's get Kevin.

2226
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:46,016
I knew
he was dumb as a box of rocks.

2227
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:48,474
I didn't know he's as heavy as one.
What's he made out of?

2228
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:50,437
Pure muscle. Oh, and baby-soft skin.

2229
01:50:51,680 --> 01:50:53,591
Come on, Rowan, show yourself!

2230
01:50:54,160 --> 01:50:56,037
What form would you prefer I take?

2231
01:50:56,120 --> 01:50:58,793
Uh, maybe something stationary.
Like a bull's-eye.

2232
01:50:58,920 --> 01:51:00,558
Well, I'll tell you what I prefer.

2233
01:51:00,640 --> 01:51:03,996
I prefer something nice and cute,
like a friendly little ghost.

2234
01:51:05,120 --> 01:51:06,872
Oh. Is this what you want?

2235
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:08,313
Something more familiar?

2236
01:51:08,680 --> 01:51:09,954
Mmm, Ice cream. Mmm.

2237
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:12,296
Well, you know what,
I don't have no problem with that.

2238
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:13,960
Thank you very much for being reasonable.

2239
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:16,349
If this is what you want, it works for me.

2240
01:51:18,280 --> 01:51:20,475
Oh, God, he's really going for it.

2241
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:22,710
Man, I said cute. Cute!

2242
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:23,949
Oh, God.

2243
01:51:24,520 --> 01:51:27,080
No. No, no, no.

2244
01:51:27,200 --> 01:51:28,200
No.

2245
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:31,153
Okay, this is not good.

2246
01:51:31,280 --> 01:51:32,280
Whoa!

2247
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:50,834
Run! Run!

2248
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:24,032
Come on!

2249
01:52:24,520 --> 01:52:25,669
Erin!

2250
01:52:32,360 --> 01:52:35,352
Okay. Homeboy is pretty much
not keeping up with what we agreed upon.

2251
01:52:38,360 --> 01:52:41,875
What part of "small and friendly"
did he not understand?

2252
01:52:47,320 --> 01:52:48,320
Oh!

2253
01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:49,754
What do we do now?

2254
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:52,816
We gotta go back there. We've got to shoot
directly in the portal with more power.

2255
01:52:52,840 --> 01:52:55,136
If we can do that, we might be able
to cause a reverse reaction.

2256
01:52:55,160 --> 01:52:56,513
We gotta cross the streams.

2257
01:52:56,600 --> 01:52:59,496
Wait, wait, wait. You mean that thing
you were talking about that's so powerful

2258
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:01,272
that will make all of our atoms implode?

2259
01:53:01,360 --> 01:53:03,656
No, implode is the wrong word.
It'll be more violent than that.

2260
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:06,035
We gotta cross 'em up,
and we've got an extremely good shot

2261
01:53:06,120 --> 01:53:09,669
at pulling all the ionized ecto-matter
back into the dimension of its origin.

2262
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:11,916
So, on the plus side, we save the world.

2263
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:16,198
And on the negative side, we experience the
most painful death conceivable of all time.

2264
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:18,436
Yeah. It's hard to shine
that penny, but yeah.

2265
01:53:18,760 --> 01:53:19,760
Okay.

2266
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:21,320
Let's do it.

2267
01:53:21,400 --> 01:53:24,073
Attagirl. Okay, let's go. Go, go, go.

2268
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:33,720
Oh!

2269
01:53:39,800 --> 01:53:41,233
All right, fire 'em up.

2270
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:49,320
Ahh!

2271
01:54:06,320 --> 01:54:07,355
The portal's too strong.

2272
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:09,874
We still don't have enough power
to reverse it.

2273
01:54:15,160 --> 01:54:17,754
Yo, what about that nuclear thing
on top of the car?

2274
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:20,832
If we can get those reactors
super-critical inside the vortex,

2275
01:54:20,920 --> 01:54:23,195
the beta radiation could 180 the polarity.

2276
01:54:23,280 --> 01:54:25,475
Causing a total protonic reversal.

2277
01:54:25,560 --> 01:54:27,676
It's gonna turn that portal
into a giant ghost trap.

2278
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:29,432
You are a genius, Patty.

2279
01:54:29,680 --> 01:54:30,908
I'm a Ghostbuster.

2280
01:54:31,640 --> 01:54:33,551
All right, let's narrow his path.

2281
01:54:41,640 --> 01:54:43,073
Aim for the silver canisters.

2282
01:55:05,080 --> 01:55:06,195
It's working!

2283
01:55:18,240 --> 01:55:19,275
He's too strong.

2284
01:55:19,360 --> 01:55:21,794
We can't let the portal close
with him still here.

2285
01:55:21,880 --> 01:55:22,915
All right, ladies.

2286
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:24,954
Let's loosen his grip.

2287
01:55:34,280 --> 01:55:35,696
Yo, that's where
you wanted us to shoot, right?

2288
01:55:35,720 --> 01:55:36,914
Yes.

2289
01:55:44,920 --> 01:55:46,069
Look out!

2290
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:48,589
Abby!

2291
01:56:06,760 --> 01:56:08,034
The portal's closing!

2292
01:56:08,120 --> 01:56:10,634
- Abby, hang on! I'm coming!
- What is she doing?

2293
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:18,315
Hang on, Abby!

2294
01:56:47,200 --> 01:56:48,519
Abby!

2295
01:56:57,880 --> 01:56:58,915
Erin.

2296
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:01,478
I wasn't gonna leave you twice.

2297
01:57:01,800 --> 01:57:02,915
Yeah.

2298
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:05,000
Mmm-hmm.

2299
01:57:05,200 --> 01:57:06,758
- Oh!
- Hold on!

2300
01:57:10,240 --> 01:57:12,216
- Oh, my God.
- We got to get 'em out of there.

2301
01:57:12,240 --> 01:57:13,760
We got to get 'em out of there!

2302
01:57:38,880 --> 01:57:40,313
Shut up!

2303
01:57:40,880 --> 01:57:42,598
Yeah!

2304
01:57:42,680 --> 01:57:43,715
Hell yeah!

2305
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:48,070
Yeah! Yeah!

2306
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:49,957
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

2307
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:51,080
Oh, my God!

2308
01:57:52,240 --> 01:57:53,719
- Whoa.
- Yeah! Yeah!

2309
01:57:54,440 --> 01:57:55,793
- What's "whoa"?
- Yes.

2310
01:57:55,920 --> 01:57:57,035
- Oh!
- No!

2311
01:57:58,440 --> 01:57:59,509
Oh, my...

2312
01:57:59,600 --> 01:58:01,750
Oh, my gosh.

2313
01:58:04,240 --> 01:58:05,798
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

2314
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:07,108
Oh, my gosh! Uh...

2315
01:58:08,320 --> 01:58:09,548
What year is it?

2316
01:58:09,640 --> 01:58:10,834
- It's 2040.
- What?

2317
01:58:10,920 --> 01:58:13,195
- Our president is a plant.
- Oh, my God!

2318
01:58:13,280 --> 01:58:14,872
I'm kidding. You were gone two seconds.

2319
01:58:14,960 --> 01:58:16,313
- We did it, huh?
- Yeah.

2320
01:58:16,440 --> 01:58:18,237
- Yeah, you did it.
- Yep.

2321
01:58:18,360 --> 01:58:19,679
- We all did it.
- We all did it.

2322
01:58:19,760 --> 01:58:21,496
- We all did it.
- That's right.

2323
01:58:21,520 --> 01:58:24,080
- We all did it.
- Well, uh...

2324
01:58:24,320 --> 01:58:26,390
What did you do, Kevin?

2325
01:58:26,480 --> 01:58:27,674
I did a lot, actually.

2326
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:29,656
I'll have you know that
I walked over to the power box,

2327
01:58:29,680 --> 01:58:30,829
pushed a bunch of buttons.

2328
01:58:30,920 --> 01:58:33,480
Everything got sucked into the portal,
then it closed up.

2329
01:58:33,560 --> 01:58:34,834
- Ah, Kev.
- That's...

2330
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:37,110
Sweet, sweet Kev. The two are unrelated.

2331
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:41,510
Uh, more important question.
When did you have time to get a sandwich?

2332
01:58:41,720 --> 01:58:44,016
Oh, when I was looking for you guys,
I looked in that deli over there.

2333
01:58:44,040 --> 01:58:47,669
Uh... When we were risking our lives,
trying to save New York City,

2334
01:58:47,760 --> 01:58:49,796
you stopped in to get a sandwich?

2335
01:58:49,880 --> 01:58:51,472
Quit splitting hairs, okay?

2336
01:58:51,600 --> 01:58:53,158
Potatoes, tomatoes. It doesn't matter.

2337
01:58:53,240 --> 01:58:54,992
Point is, the Ghostbusters...

2338
01:58:55,880 --> 01:58:57,199
Are back together again, okay?

2339
01:58:57,280 --> 01:58:58,560
And that's what friends are for.

2340
01:59:00,600 --> 01:59:02,477
- Just glad you okay, man.
- Kevin!

2341
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:04,278
Yes. Hold my hand longer.

2342
01:59:04,360 --> 01:59:05,918
Okay. Okay. Okay.

2343
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,389
I love the hair, by the way.
Makes you look a lot older.

2344
01:59:08,480 --> 01:59:09,708
- You know what?
- Hmm?

2345
01:59:11,560 --> 01:59:12,834
A little help, please?

2346
01:59:13,520 --> 01:59:14,520
Uh...

2347
01:59:16,280 --> 01:59:17,280
Really?

2348
01:59:20,080 --> 01:59:21,638
Can I have the beverage, please?

2349
01:59:21,720 --> 01:59:22,720
Don't.

2350
01:59:24,080 --> 01:59:25,080
Mmm.

2351
01:59:26,160 --> 01:59:27,388
And a muffin, thanks.

2352
01:59:28,240 --> 01:59:29,240
Oh, my God.

2353
01:59:30,080 --> 01:59:31,479
Are you a wizard?

2354
01:59:31,800 --> 01:59:33,279
In the aftermath of the events,

2355
01:59:33,360 --> 01:59:35,040
authorities are still trying to understand

2356
01:59:35,080 --> 01:59:37,913
what happened in Times Square
and throughout the city.

2357
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,230
I saw Pilgrims. Ghost Pilgrims.

2358
01:59:40,520 --> 01:59:44,479
So you're honestly gonna stand here
and tell me that we didn't all see ghosts,

2359
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:45,959
that what actually happened

2360
01:59:46,040 --> 01:59:48,759
was that terrorists drugged all
of the water with hallucinogens.

2361
01:59:48,840 --> 01:59:49,909
Yes. Yes.

2362
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:51,319
Wait, what?

2363
01:59:51,400 --> 01:59:53,072
- Baba Booey!
- I... I...

2364
01:59:53,320 --> 01:59:56,630
...with the government trying to claim
the event wasn't supernatural,

2365
01:59:56,720 --> 01:59:59,996
despite so many eyewitness accounts
to the contrary.

2366
02:00:00,080 --> 02:00:01,274
The big question is,

2367
02:00:01,360 --> 02:00:05,035
was it the four women
who refer to themselves as Ghostbusters

2368
02:00:05,120 --> 02:00:06,951
who actually thwarted the attack?

2369
02:00:07,040 --> 02:00:08,040
We may never know.

2370
02:00:08,080 --> 02:00:09,991
Well, now I know how Batman feels.

2371
02:00:11,880 --> 02:00:13,976
You know what?
You don't have to keep fiddling with it.

2372
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,719
I think it looks nice. Right?

2373
02:00:16,880 --> 02:00:18,472
I'd talk to you at an AA meeting.

2374
02:00:18,640 --> 02:00:20,471
It's my fault, anyway.

2375
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:22,256
The box said the color was called Garfield.

2376
02:00:22,280 --> 02:00:23,633
- Ooh.
- Mmm.

2377
02:00:23,720 --> 02:00:26,154
It wasn't even the cat.
It was the president.

2378
02:00:26,280 --> 02:00:27,280
Oh.

2379
02:00:27,320 --> 02:00:29,515
It was part of
the Dead Presidents Color Collection.

2380
02:00:29,600 --> 02:00:31,272
You stay away from Taft.

2381
02:00:31,360 --> 02:00:34,238
That's my mother's color.
I don't want to see that on anyone's head.

2382
02:00:34,320 --> 02:00:36,470
Mine was "Woman with a Secret."

2383
02:00:37,320 --> 02:00:39,072
And she was kind of going, "Shh."

2384
02:00:39,160 --> 02:00:40,991
And she appeared to be in a canoe.

2385
02:00:41,080 --> 02:00:43,136
You know what? I want to make a toast.

2386
02:00:43,160 --> 02:00:44,229
Oh.

2387
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:45,389
Uh-oh.

2388
02:00:45,480 --> 02:00:47,118
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

2389
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:51,549
Physics is the study of
the movement of, uh, bodies in space,

2390
02:00:51,680 --> 02:00:54,956
and it can unlock the mysteries
of the universe.

2391
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:59,670
But it cannot answer the essential question
of what is our purpose here.

2392
02:00:59,760 --> 02:01:03,116
And, to me, the purpose of life is to love.

2393
02:01:03,200 --> 02:01:06,749
And to love is what you have shown me.

2394
02:01:06,840 --> 02:01:09,752
I didn't think that I would
ever really have a friend until I met Abby,

2395
02:01:09,840 --> 02:01:12,070
and then I feel like I
have a family of my own.

2396
02:01:12,240 --> 02:01:13,673
And I love you. Thank you.

2397
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:15,400
Thank you.

2398
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:17,216
I mean, that was like a
real thing right there.

2399
02:01:17,240 --> 02:01:19,040
- Yeah, that was...
- That was, like, so real.

2400
02:01:19,120 --> 02:01:21,160
I'm so sorry I'm late.

2401
02:01:21,400 --> 02:01:22,435
Oh.

2402
02:01:22,520 --> 02:01:25,432
We want to thank you for your discretion.

2403
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:28,159
It's not working at all, but thank you.

2404
02:01:28,240 --> 02:01:32,233
Actually, we'd like you to continue
to study this subject,

2405
02:01:32,320 --> 02:01:33,878
fully funded.

2406
02:01:33,960 --> 02:01:37,077
You know, we need to be better prepared,
just in case.

2407
02:01:37,160 --> 02:01:38,798
- Yeah. Yes, that's smart.
- Yes.

2408
02:01:38,880 --> 02:01:40,836
Whatever you need, going forward.

2409
02:01:40,920 --> 02:01:42,114
Anything at all.

2410
02:01:43,280 --> 02:01:44,429
Anything?

2411
02:01:45,560 --> 02:01:46,629
Anything.

2412
02:01:46,720 --> 02:01:48,073
Hell yeah!

2413
02:01:49,560 --> 02:01:50,595
Second floor is mine.

2414
02:01:50,680 --> 02:01:52,511
You can't claim a whole floor.

2415
02:01:52,600 --> 02:01:53,696
- I just did.
- You can't...

2416
02:01:53,720 --> 02:01:55,438
You can't do that, Holtzy!

2417
02:01:55,760 --> 02:01:57,398
Not bad, ghost girl.

2418
02:01:57,480 --> 02:01:59,516
Thank you, and I proudly take that title.

2419
02:02:04,120 --> 02:02:05,872
- Is that...
- Patty's uncle.

2420
02:02:10,200 --> 02:02:11,349
Unc!

2421
02:02:12,160 --> 02:02:13,195
Where is it?

2422
02:02:13,720 --> 02:02:15,576
What are you talking about?
I told you what happened.

2423
02:02:15,600 --> 02:02:16,874
Where's the car?

2424
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:19,315
- It's on the other side.
- In Jersey?

2425
02:02:19,400 --> 02:02:21,960
- No, in the portal.
- Ah, huh...

2426
02:02:22,040 --> 02:02:24,679
You know what? We should probably
let them just work this out.

2427
02:02:24,760 --> 02:02:25,760
- Excuse me.
- Patty,

2428
02:02:25,800 --> 02:02:27,677
I got four funerals this weekend.

2429
02:02:27,760 --> 02:02:29,478
I can't do them with just one hearse.

2430
02:02:29,560 --> 02:02:31,136
Maybe you could do two at a time.

2431
02:02:31,160 --> 02:02:32,736
We're not stacking
'em like flapjacks!

2432
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:46,838
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

2433
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:48,234
I know what you did.

2434
02:02:48,480 --> 02:02:49,680
What? Oh...

2435
02:02:49,720 --> 02:02:52,393
Bennie, don't get weird on me, okay?

2436
02:02:53,760 --> 02:02:54,954
What is...

2437
02:02:55,400 --> 02:02:56,992
Yeah!

2438
02:02:57,080 --> 02:03:01,358
I'm just looking for a reasonable ratio
of wontons to broth.

2439
02:03:01,440 --> 02:03:02,953
This is absolute madness.

2440
02:03:03,080 --> 02:03:05,719
Come on, girl.
You deserve every wonton in the world.

2441
02:03:05,800 --> 02:03:07,870
Don't let any man tell you otherwise.

2442
02:03:07,960 --> 02:03:09,016
- Okay, you can go.
- All right.

2443
02:03:09,040 --> 02:03:10,336
- We still good for brunch?
- Nope.

2444
02:03:10,360 --> 02:03:11,360
Just go.

2445
02:03:26,840 --> 02:03:29,912
Ghostbusters. Please give
a detailed description of your apparition.

2446
02:03:30,200 --> 02:03:32,395
Mmm-hmm. Well, that sounds like

2447
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:36,792
an illusional meta-physious, spectro-mian.

2448
02:03:36,880 --> 02:03:37,995
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

2449
02:03:38,080 --> 02:03:39,718
I'm talking like you guys.

2450
02:03:39,800 --> 02:03:41,119
- Way to go, Kev.
- Yeah.

2451
02:03:41,200 --> 02:03:43,350
Well, that sounds very scary.

2452
02:03:43,440 --> 02:03:46,750
It's probably 'cause you got a lot of
bad karma from your previous life. Mmm.

2453
02:03:48,680 --> 02:03:49,908
Oh, I hate coffee.

2454
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:51,877
I'm just gonna disconnect his phone.

2455
02:03:51,960 --> 02:03:53,188
- He won't notice.
- No.

2456
02:04:09,280 --> 02:04:10,952
How's it going over here?

2457
02:04:11,120 --> 02:04:12,951
Um, good. Really good.

2458
02:04:13,040 --> 02:04:16,157
I'm working on some kind
of next-level stuff.

2459
02:04:16,240 --> 02:04:18,196
Case in point.

2460
02:04:18,520 --> 02:04:20,033
Whoa!

2461
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:22,479
Wow.

2462
02:04:22,800 --> 02:04:23,800
What is this for?

2463
02:04:23,880 --> 02:04:26,997
It catches ghosts
and it transports them somewhere else.

2464
02:04:27,080 --> 02:04:28,399
I don't know where, uh,

2465
02:04:28,520 --> 02:04:30,988
but I have a feeling it's Michigan.

2466
02:04:32,440 --> 02:04:34,032
Sorry, Lansing.

2467
02:04:45,760 --> 02:04:47,637
Hey, how's this containment unit?

2468
02:04:47,720 --> 02:04:49,199
Oh, you got that up and going?

2469
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:51,635
Oh, that?
Oh, that's going real smooth.

2470
02:04:51,720 --> 02:04:56,191
Uh, I just would say don't be in a room
with it for more than an hour at a time,

2471
02:04:56,280 --> 02:04:59,590
because I'm thinking a lot of hair loss.

2472
02:04:59,720 --> 02:05:02,280
Oh, well, that might be something
we want to work on. Oh.

2473
02:05:02,360 --> 02:05:05,955
Uh, hi. Hello. Sorry, I didn't know
anyone else was here.

2474
02:05:06,040 --> 02:05:07,616
What a ding-a-ling. I forgot to introduce.

2475
02:05:07,640 --> 02:05:09,949
This is my mentor, Dr. Rebecca Gorin.

2476
02:05:10,560 --> 02:05:12,312
This is reckless, Jillian.

2477
02:05:12,600 --> 02:05:14,136
All someone has to do is sneeze too hard

2478
02:05:14,160 --> 02:05:16,515
and everyone in this building
is going to disintegrate.

2479
02:05:16,760 --> 02:05:18,990
It's completely unstable.

2480
02:05:19,080 --> 02:05:20,672
Do we need this safety light?

2481
02:05:20,760 --> 02:05:24,912
Safety lights are for dudes.

2482
02:05:27,440 --> 02:05:28,475
I hate doing that.

2483
02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:32,272
Hey, y'all need to come check this out.
Come up to the roof.

2484
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:44,278
Is that for us?

2485
02:05:44,360 --> 02:05:47,716
I guess some people
actually do know what we did.

2486
02:05:48,200 --> 02:05:49,952
Well, that's not terrible.

2487
02:05:50,520 --> 02:05:51,953
No, it's not.

2488
02:05:52,040 --> 02:05:53,519
It's not terrible at all.

2489
02:06:14,120 --> 02:06:18,113
Who you gonna call when you feel
all pent up inside your head?

2490
02:06:18,360 --> 02:06:22,319
Do you wanna know how the story goes
or make it up instead?

2491
02:06:22,920 --> 02:06:24,672
Now, you're complicated

2492
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:26,791
Scares us to the bone

2493
02:06:27,280 --> 02:06:30,192
But no one says you're better off alone

2494
02:06:30,840 --> 02:06:32,558
I got the ghost

2495
02:06:32,680 --> 02:06:33,749
Get ghost

2496
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:35,319
Is scaring you the most

2497
02:06:35,440 --> 02:06:36,714
I think the ghost

2498
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:37,800
The ghost

2499
02:06:37,880 --> 02:06:39,552
Is scaring you the most

2500
02:06:39,800 --> 02:06:40,869
I got the ghost

2501
02:06:41,120 --> 02:06:43,953
That spirit you harbor in your bones

2502
02:06:44,720 --> 02:06:46,597
Likeness that you fear the most

2503
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:48,392
But don't forget you're gonna

2504
02:06:48,600 --> 02:06:49,828
Get ghost

2505
02:06:52,880 --> 02:06:54,359
Get ghost

2506
02:06:57,240 --> 02:06:58,639
Get ghost

2507
02:07:01,560 --> 02:07:02,959
Get ghost

2508
02:07:06,480 --> 02:07:10,473
Like the rhythm, it makes you feel
just a little like lifting off the ground

2509
02:07:10,680 --> 02:07:14,673
Feeling a pull and the party's full
and you just got to get out

2510
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,275
Oh, you're in no position

2511
02:07:17,520 --> 02:07:19,158
Call the other now

2512
02:07:19,680 --> 02:07:22,513
Funny how you're callin ' on us now

2513
02:07:23,400 --> 02:07:24,674
I got the ghost

2514
02:07:24,880 --> 02:07:25,880
Get ghost

2515
02:07:26,200 --> 02:07:27,599
Is scarin ' you the most

2516
02:07:27,680 --> 02:07:29,193
I think the ghost

2517
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:30,280
The ghost

2518
02:07:30,520 --> 02:07:31,839
Is scarin ' you the most

2519
02:07:32,200 --> 02:07:33,519
I got the ghost

2520
02:07:37,320 --> 02:07:39,072
Likeness that you fear the most

2521
02:07:39,200 --> 02:07:40,918
But don't forget you're gonna

2522
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:42,149
Get ghost

2523
02:07:45,240 --> 02:07:46,240
Get ghost

2524
02:07:49,560 --> 02:07:51,039
Get ghost

2525
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:55,194
Get ghost

2526
02:07:59,200 --> 02:08:01,270
When you start getting done
it's time to get ghost

2527
02:08:01,400 --> 02:08:03,595
Everybody 'round you start doin ' the most

2528
02:08:03,680 --> 02:08:05,716
Everybody pullin ' up with they hands out

Ay, wanna hold a couple bands now

But I'm busy getting ghost,
I ain 't never around

2534
02:08:17,080 --> 02:08:18,832
I get ghost with the big checks

2535
02:08:18,960 --> 02:08:21,269
Ghost Phantom
when I'm handling my business

2536
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:23,555
Move out the way 'cause I'm driving crazy

2537
02:08:23,640 --> 02:08:25,790
All these girls, girls date me

2538

Yeah!

2539
02:08:27,160 --> 02:08:29,469
But it really makes me feel good

2540
02:08:30,200 --> 02:08:33,237
Yeah, ghost, yeah

2541
02:08:35,440 --> 02:08:36,919

Get ghost

2546
02:09:10,760 --> 02:09:11,760
Get ghost

2547
02:09:14,720 --> 02:09:16,073
Get ghost

2548
02:09:23,480 --> 02:09:24,833
Get ghost

2549
02:09:28,040 --> 02:09:29,040
Get ghost

2550
02:09:40,320 --> 02:09:42,709
I've been a-dancing in a devil's dirt

2551
02:09:42,800 --> 02:09:45,314
I'm a whole lot of trouble
in a itty-bitty skirt

2552
02:09:45,440 --> 02:09:48,159
Well, the best kind of loving
is the one that hurts

2553
02:09:48,280 --> 02:09:50,953
You can get your kicks,
but I'll get mine first

2554
02:09:51,040 --> 02:09:53,474
I can take you down
when the damned get wild

2555
02:09:53,720 --> 02:09:56,359
There's a whole lot of sinning
but they're greener for miles

2556
02:09:56,480 --> 02:09:59,119
Three hits on the six,
there's a number that you dial

2557
02:09:59,200 --> 02:10:01,998
You can be like me but
I'm a real brat child

2558
02:10:02,080 --> 02:10:07,234
I do what the good girls don't

2559
02:10:07,360 --> 02:10:12,673
I do what the good girls should never ever,
never ever do

2560
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:14,353
Hey, hey, hey

2561
02:10:14,440 --> 02:10:17,159
Since I'm gonna go to hell anyway

2562
02:10:17,600 --> 02:10:19,716
I'll go out with a bang, bang, bang

2563
02:10:19,800 --> 02:10:23,429
Crash and burn it all away

2564
02:10:23,880 --> 02:10:25,233
Hey, hey, hey

2565
02:10:25,360 --> 02:10:28,670
Since I'm gonna go to hell anyway

2566
02:10:28,760 --> 02:10:30,830
I'll go out with a bang, bang, bang

2567
02:10:30,920 --> 02:10:34,708
Crash and burn it all away

2568
02:10:39,680 --> 02:10:42,797
Well, I walked in the light
and I lived in the sun

2569
02:10:42,880 --> 02:10:45,348
Now I die for the night
'cause the days are done

2570
02:10:45,600 --> 02:10:48,160
I kissed a couple of angels
but it wasn't much fun

2571
02:10:48,240 --> 02:10:50,879
Now I shake, shake, shake it
with an evil tongue

2572
02:10:51,040 --> 02:10:56,319
I do what the good girls don't

2573
02:10:56,400 --> 02:11:01,679
I do what the good girls should never ever,
never ever do

2574
02:11:02,160 --> 02:11:03,434
Hey, hey, hey

2575
02:11:03,520 --> 02:11:06,592
Since I'm gonna go to hell anyway

2576
02:11:06,680 --> 02:11:08,875
I'll go out with a bang, bang, bang

2577
02:11:08,960 --> 02:11:12,839
Crash and burn it all away

2578
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:14,319
Hey, hey, hey

2579
02:11:14,400 --> 02:11:17,551
Since I'm gonna go to hell anyway

2580
02:11:17,680 --> 02:11:19,875
I'll go out with a bang, bang, bang

2581
02:11:19,960 --> 02:11:23,669
Crash and burn it all away

2582
02:11:34,800 --> 02:11:40,113
I do what the good girls don't

2583
02:11:40,200 --> 02:11:45,433
I do what the good girls should never ever,
never ever do

2584
02:11:45,720 --> 02:11:47,039
Hey, hey, hey

2585
02:11:47,120 --> 02:11:50,351
Since I'm gonna go to hell anyway

2586
02:11:50,440 --> 02:11:52,635
I'll go out with a bang, bang, bang

2587
02:11:52,720 --> 02:11:56,554
Crash and burn it all away

2588
02:11:56,640 --> 02:11:57,959
Hey, hey, hey

2589
02:11:58,040 --> 02:12:00,952
Since I'm gonna go to hell anyway

2590
02:12:01,440 --> 02:12:03,635
I'll go out with a bang, bang, bang

2591
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:07,389
Crash and burn it all away

2592
02:12:07,520 --> 02:12:12,548
I do what the good girls don't

2593
02:12:12,640 --> 02:12:18,556
I do what the good girls should never ever,
never ever do

2594
02:12:34,640 --> 02:12:36,198
Ghostbusters!

2595
02:12:37,160 --> 02:12:38,639
If there's something strange

2596
02:12:38,920 --> 02:12:40,319
In your neighborhood

2597
02:12:41,120 --> 02:12:42,758
Who you gonna call?

2598
02:12:42,840 --> 02:12:44,273
Ghostbusters!

2599
02:12:51,080 --> 02:12:52,559
I ain't 'fraid of no ghost

2600
02:12:59,040 --> 02:13:00,951
I ain't 'fraid of no ghost

2601
02:13:01,600 --> 02:13:04,353
That's Ghostbusters, baby!

2602
02:13:11,200 --> 02:13:12,952
I call it the nutcracker.

2603
02:13:13,040 --> 02:13:14,951
Oh, 'cause it crushes the ghost.

2604
02:13:15,040 --> 02:13:16,359
No, it's for walnuts.

2605
02:13:19,320 --> 02:13:20,514
Smart.

2606
02:13:21,680 --> 02:13:22,680
Huh.

2607
02:13:25,720 --> 02:13:27,870
What is it? Did you get something?

2608
02:13:27,960 --> 02:13:30,599
Yeah. I heard something really weird.

2609
02:13:32,560 --> 02:13:33,879
What's "Zuul"?
