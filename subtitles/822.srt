1
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:45,878
The future...

2
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:48,339
The polar ice caps have melted,

3
00:00:48,424 --> 00:00:50,508
covering the earth with water.

4
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:55,596
Those who survived have adapted

5
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:57,515
to a new world.

6
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,828
Bad luck, English.

7
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:34,125
But the Slavers are producing a
good grade of poxy these days.

8
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:38,295
Cost you a handful of dirt
or maybe that wind chime.

9
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,674
- What are you doing here?
- Just waiting.

10
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,760
Take your hand off the sail.

11
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,429
Take it off!

12
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:51,350
I've seen your boat before.
Haven't seen you.

13
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,394
Took it legal.

14
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,024
Previous owner was dead
on the tiller when I found it.

15
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:01,027
You had another hour
before I traded up again.

16
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,612
Just improving my means.

17
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,533
- Well, I owe you then.
- No, thanks.

18
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:12,121
I got all the supplies I need.
Just came from an atoll.

19
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,750
Eight days east, if you're interested.

20
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,212
Two Drifters meet,
something needs to be exchanged.

21
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:23,841
I know the code.
But I'll give you this one for free.

22
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,803
Nothing's free in Waterworld.

23
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:29,680
Yeah.

24
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:41,734
Smokers.

25
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:45,196
Just enough wind to get away clean.

26
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,077
Forget the bag.

27
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:58,918
It's not worth it. You'll never make
it with your sails down.

28
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,211
Hey!

29
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:14,600
What can I say?

30
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,997
Joe, he's going for it.

31
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,791
What the hell?

32
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,048
Never seen that before.

33
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,346
Here we go! Go! Drive! Drive!

34
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,311
Faster! Faster!

35
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,627
Come on! He's gonna get it!
He's gonna get it!

36
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,232
- Go!
- Get him! Get him!

37
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:17,139
No! No!

38
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,980
Inbound! Straight out
from the gates.

39
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:17,032
English.

40
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,123
Flag's down, Drifter.
We got enough traders.

41
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,257
What does he have?

42
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,722
Dirt.

43
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,016
Open the gates!

44
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:29,355
Bones to berries. Veins to vine.

45
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:33,233
These tendons to trees.
This blood to brine.

46
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,361
Too old she was.

47
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:39,948
This woman does leave us,
recycled and enshrined

48
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,701
in the presence of him who leads us.

49
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,972
What is that?

50
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,230
You know me?

51
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,982
I know what you are.

52
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,150
Good.

53
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,570
Then you know if you look for trouble
while you're here,

54
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,948
you'll find more than you can handle.

55
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,617
You got two hours.

56
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,497
I'll only need one.

57
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,718
He's coming over here.

58
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,934
- Me.
- You each get one

59
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,395
if everything's here when I get back.

60
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,280
Pure dirt.

61
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,616
3.2 kilos.

62
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,037
How'd you come by so much of it?

63
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,875
Another atoll 30 horizons
west of here.

64
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,460
Where'd they get it?

65
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,922
- They didn't say.
- We heard about that place,

66
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:20,757
that they was all killed.

67
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,012
- That's why they didn't say.
- Smokers?

68
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:27,598
Maybe Smokers, maybe Slavers.

69
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:32,853
So what's the word? We trading or not?

70
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:37,274
We'll tally it like pure hydro.

71
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,031
Works out to 62 chits.

72
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,702
I want twice that.

73
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:54,333
I just want one sip of hydro!

74
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,376
No, not till you tell me.

75
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:59,880
She got inkings on her back.
I seen her.

76
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:03,425
They say if you read
the marks on the child,

77
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,386
they'll lead you
all the way to Dryland.

78
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:09,681
- Dryland's a myth.
- Some still believe.

79
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:13,060
They say the Smokers
even got an eye out for her.

80
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:17,856
Well, then, we'd better
keep it to ourselves.

81
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,507
- Help you?
- Yeah.

82
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,802
- Where's the store?
- You found it.

83
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,309
You don't have much.

84
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,563
You the man with the dirt?

85
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:17,457
Skoal.

86
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,005
- One more.
- Make it two.

87
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:26,258
A man this rich will buy for
a fellow outwater, I'm sure.

88
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,594
One.

89
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:35,183
That's an interesting
pair of boots you got.

90
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:38,186
- Trade?
- No.

91
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,355
Shame.

92
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,070
That's her.

93
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,531
Enola. Hey, what are you doing?

94
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:51,199
No, you can't do that.

95
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,827
I need another piece.
I want to draw some more.

96
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:57,247
I'll give it to you.
Just stay in the back.

97
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:59,958
With all those chits,
you could order up a bath.

98
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,644
- Have you ever had a freshwater bath?
- Why are you talking to me?

99
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,129
Just being friendly.

100
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:12,804
- Is that a tomato plant?
- Yeah.

101
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,765
You have a keen eye.

102
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:16,975
Saw one in a picture. How much?

103
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,608
Half your chits.

104
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,705
- I'll take them, too.
- Take what?

105
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:42,626
- You bought everything.
- I'll take them shelves.

106
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:48,507
So, what did you see out there
in your 15 months?

107
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:51,802
- Such as?
- An end to all this water.

108
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:53,428
Asking the wrong person.

109
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:54,721
Where did he come from?

110
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,640
- The one they buried today?
- Uh-huh.

111
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,767
She found the only end there is.

112
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,942
I've got a proposition
for you, Mariner.

113
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,611
I'm not staying.

114
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:13,699
We're not asking you to.
All we want is your seed.

115
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:17,869
We can look to our own
for impregnation,

116
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:22,833
but too much of that sort of thing
gets undesirable.

117
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:24,918
When she's pregnant,

118
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:28,088
you go on your way with all the
supplies you need.

119
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:32,134
You don't have anything. You're dying.

120
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:41,268
No man stays out that long
and turns down a woman.

121
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,898
- He's hiding something.
- Maybe he's a Smoker spy.

122
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:01,580
When the elders say so,
you can leave, and not before.

123
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,726
Gills.

124
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,104
Mutation!

125
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:28,565
He's a mutant!

126
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,610
My hand!

127
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,126
Throw the nets!

128
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,694
He's a murderer!

129
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:22,661
By what right...

130
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,998
You pay me to keep the peace.

131
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,168
- This isn't it.
- No!

132
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:33,421
- He has killed one of ours.
- He was defending himself.

133
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,923
He needs to be destroyed!

134
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:37,467
- Kill him. Let's kill him.
- That may be,

135
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:40,929
but not here and not like this.

136
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,588
What is it?

137
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:16,464
Damn.

138
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,969
They're too tight. I can't get it off.

139
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,057
Open the gate.

140
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,842
Is it a map?

141
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,804
You'd tell me if you knew,
wouldn't you, Enola?

142
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,139
Mmm-hmm.

143
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,395
- What are you drawing?
- I don't know.

144
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:17,984
Helen, look. Look at the prodigal
child's latest vision.

145
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:25,909
How soon before we can leave?

146
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:29,287
I don't have any idea yet
where we can go.

147
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:32,582
I haven't figured out
the tattoo on her back.

148
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:35,085
I'm a stupid man.
The answer's right there.

149
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:38,129
It's just beyond me.

150
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,926
Maybe he knows.

151
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,022
Yes, I see. They are webbed.

152
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:58,191
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven,

153
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:01,094
eight, nine, ten digits.
That's wonderful.

154
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,698
They tell me, too,
that you have gills. Isotropic gills.

155
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:07,742
Are they merely vestigial
or are they functional?

156
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:12,247
My name is Gregor.
I've just come to pay you a little...

157
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:14,749
Oh, my God.

158
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:20,755
I'm sorry. I'm not laughing at you.
I'm excited.

159
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,966
Your gills, they're functional.

160
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,428
Ichthyus sapien.
You can breathe in the water.

161
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,304
How deep can you go?

162
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:33,351
Look, I'm only here because I want
to learn more about you.

163
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:41,568
You don't like humans
very much, do you?

164
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,571
I can't say that I blame you.

165
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:48,033
But tell me, are all of your kind
as bad-tempered as you are?

166
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:54,497
- I have no kind.
- Oh, fish rot.

167
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:57,459
I'd be surprised if there weren't
others, and if there aren't,

168
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,294
there will be eventually.

169
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:04,549
Anyway, I've come here because
I need to ask you a question.

170
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:08,887
Where did your dirt come from?

171
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:10,805
Is it from Dryland?

172
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,141
Do you know what this is?

173
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:17,687
The ancients, they did
something terrible, didn't they?

174
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:21,524
To cause all this water.
Hundreds, hundreds of years ago.

175
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:24,069
If I tell you,
will you open this lock?

176
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,364
I haven't a key.

177
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,744
- There's a mooring cleat down there.
- What?

178
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,079
Good as any key.

179
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:35,789
A mooring cleat?

180
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:40,502
I won't hurt anyone. I'll just leave.

181
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:44,964
- I'll be right back.
- Gregor!

182
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:48,259
What's your business there?
Move along!

183
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:50,095
I'm not a brave man.

184
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:54,516
If you know anything about Dryland,
please tell me. Please!

185
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:57,435
Don't let it die with you.

186
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,021
No, no, no, no. Stop!

187
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,691
Gregor! Move along!

188
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:43,398
After considerable deliberation
of the evidence at hand,

189
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:49,487
it is our decision that this mute-o
does, indeed, constitute a threat.

190
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:53,700
Therefore, in the interest
of public safety,

191
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:57,453
he is hereby sentenced to be recycled

192
00:24:57,538 --> 00:24:59,581
in the customary fashion.

193
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:01,916
Proceed.

194
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,632
I'm sorry.

195
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:19,184
Bones to berries. Veins to vines.

196
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:23,313
These tendons to trees.
This blood to brine.

197
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:26,524
Too strange for life he was.

198
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:30,486
This mute-o now does leave us,

199
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:33,489
recycled and entombed,

200
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:37,118
in the presence of him who leads us.

201
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:51,591
Smokers! Get out of the sun!

202
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:57,972
- Hurry up!
- To your posts!

203
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:15,323
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

204
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,962
- Kill!
- There!

205
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:42,308
We are safe behind this wall.

206
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:44,769
Aren't we?

207
00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:55,029
Let me out!

208
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,365
Let me out! I'll fight!

209
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,814
Give me the key to the city now.

210
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:35,945
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

211
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:41,909
- Floor it! Floor it!
- Come on!

212
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:05,433
Swab it! Swab it!

213
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,102
God damn! More ammo!

214
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:24,660
Break down the door!

215
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,708
My God!

216
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,009
We'll have this atoll in no time.

217
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,139
Crank it! Crank it!

218
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,561
Look!

219
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,499
Look out!

220
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,649
Oh, no!

221
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,871
Keep that gas going! Fill them up!

222
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:31,287
Helen, come quickly!

223
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,539
Helen! Helen!

224
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:05,655
You're not supposed to go yet!

225
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:07,782
Infernal machine!

226
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:14,205
Gregor. Gregor, wait!

227
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:17,416
Helen, I tried. There was an accident.
I couldn't make it stop. Hurry!

228
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:19,585
- You can make it if you try. Run!
- Please, stop!

229
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,420
Up those stairs. Run! Quickly!

230
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:24,275
- Wait! Wait!
- I'll throw you a rope.

231
00:31:24,301 --> 00:31:25,408
Run quickly!

232
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:26,499
Throw the rope now.

233
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,101
- Come on. Run, Enola.
- Slow down! Wait!

234
00:31:28,116 --> 00:31:28,791
Throw the rope.

235
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:32,306
- No! No!
- Wait!

236
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,811
- Gregor, don't leave us!
- Oh, no!

237
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,146
I'm sorry! It was an accident!

238
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:46,988
Helen! Enola! Helen, I'm sorry!

239
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:59,333
Shoot him. Shoot him.

240
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:29,196
If I let you out of here,
you're taking us with you.

241
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:31,699
Sure.

242
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:37,288
Enola, get down.

243
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:40,333
Here. Get over here. Get down.

244
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:42,168
Hurry! Come on!

245
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,048
Get the gate.

246
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:48,359
Hurry up!

247
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,778
Kamikaze! Come on!

248
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,475
That made a hole.

249
00:34:34,156 --> 00:34:36,490
Find her! Get the girl!

250
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,872
There!

251
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:53,799
Go get that guy! Go! Kill him!

252
00:34:58,388 --> 00:34:59,930
- Wow!
- Enola!

253
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:13,819
- You're too slow!
- Run to the other side.

254
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:17,573
Come on!

255
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:25,831
Grab on! Hold on, hold on.

256
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:32,755
It's stuck! I can't make it through!

257
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,131
Let her go!

258
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,551
Just drop her!

259
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:55,236
Turn the wheel. The wheel! Turn it!

260
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:02,785
That! Come on! Push it!

261
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,996
- I am!
- Hurry! Now pull!

262
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:09,834
Push it! Push it hard! Push it!

263
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:13,379
Okay, okay! Now pull this!
Pull this! Go! Go!

264
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:15,881
Pull it! Pull!

265
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:29,562
Enola, jump.

266
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:34,149
- Jump! Look at me. Jump! Now!
- Okay!

267
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:53,085
Well, excuse me!

268
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:56,380
Did I say anybody could leave before
the battle was over? Did I?

269
00:36:56,464 --> 00:37:00,009
- No!
- No! Well, do something. I hate sails.

270
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,688
Hey! Can you steer?

271
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:14,690
Can I trust you?

272
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:52,645
Answer me this, somebody.
Why is that boat still firing?

273
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:56,565
- What's that cousin's name?
- Chuck.

274
00:37:56,691 --> 00:38:00,152
Hey, Chuck!
He's pulling him right into us.

275
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:04,865
Maybe he doesn't answer to Chuck.
Call him Charles. Charles!

276
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:09,745
Stop him! Stop him!

277
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:19,213
Charles!

278
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,258
Adios, cousins.

279
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,890
She's here somewhere. Keep looking.

280
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:13,934
Stop it!

281
00:39:14,728 --> 00:39:16,603
Let me down!

282
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:24,903
What you got?

283
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:27,990
Couple of heartbeats over there.
Aren't saying much.

284
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,717
If you'll notice the arterial
nature of the blood

285
00:39:31,743 --> 00:39:33,604
coming from the hole in my head,

286
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:37,875
you can assume that we're
all having a real lousy day.

287
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:41,795
So here it is, I need to know
about that tattooed girl.

288
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:45,883
First one that tells me lives.

289
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:50,721
- I saw a girl. I saw... It was...
- She had a big tattoo on her.

290
00:39:53,475 --> 00:39:55,350
You won. Start over.

291
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:57,311
I saw a girl.

292
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:02,024
I'm not sure, but I think she got on
that boat with three hulls.

293
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:05,569
The boat that cost me
1,000 G's of go-juice?

294
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,571
Yeah, the mute-o's boat.

295
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:11,575
- Mute-o?
- Yeah. He got these slits here.

296
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:15,162
Like fish gills.

297
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,247
He wasn't really a man.

298
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:20,626
A fluke of evolution.

299
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:24,004
Oh, I'm sorry. A fluke of...

300
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:26,465
- Evolution.
- I know!

301
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:30,594
No! No, you said you wouldn't kill me!
- Did I say that?

302
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,597
- Witnesses, anybody, did I?
- Yes, yes, yes! You said...

303
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,682
- You said it.
- Oh, I may have.

304
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:39,561
I may have.

305
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,654
We get to the 'Deez,

306
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:53,283
tank up that sky boat,
send it out on patrol.

307
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:59,706
We gotta keep an eye out
for that ichthy-freak.

308
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:25,607
You been there, haven't you?

309
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:31,905
Dryland?

310
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:34,741
You know where it is.

311
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:38,203
Yeah, I know where it is.

312
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:44,251
And... And we're going?

313
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:46,753
You and I are.

314
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:51,049
The kid we gotta pitch over the side.

315
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:56,763
- What?
- My boat's tore up.

316
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,434
I'm taking on water.

317
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:03,604
I'd be lucky to get half a hydro
ration out of that.

318
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:07,149
You know... I said I won't drink.

319
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,109
For 12 days?

320
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:16,700
No. It's better one of you dies now
than both of you die slow.

321
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:18,035
Wait. Wait.

322
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:22,206
We saved your life. We got you out.

323
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:25,792
No, you got me out so you could
get out. We're even.

324
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:27,920
She can cook. She can fish.

325
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:29,446
- So can I.
- Then take my necklace.

326
00:42:29,457 --> 00:42:30,322
Take my necklace.

327
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,633
- I got better ones below.
- No, look!

328
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,722
After what you went through
back there on the atoll,

329
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:41,141
I can understand
why you would want to.

330
00:42:41,935 --> 00:42:43,852
But she's a child.

331
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:56,990
Is there something else, then?

332
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,665
Enola! Go below.

333
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,626
Enola.

334
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:19,930
Yeah.

335
00:43:20,682 --> 00:43:22,516
You said so yourself.

336
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,852
Been out there a long time.

337
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,319
Couple hours ago,
I was potential dirt to you.

338
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,279
We're not like that.

339
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,239
You all are.

340
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:27,164
Know what I was really thinking?

341
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:30,917
Why I don't drop both of you
in my wake right now.

342
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:34,129
You got nothing I need.

343
00:44:50,772 --> 00:44:52,939
You're taking us to Dryland.

344
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,614
Killing's a hard thing to do well.

345
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:03,358
Believe me. I'm not the
one to start on.

346
00:45:03,384 --> 00:45:04,226
Both of us!

347
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:12,000
How long you plan to hold that on me?

348
00:45:12,085 --> 00:45:13,877
As long as it takes.

349
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,466
- Okay.
- No!

350
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:24,388
Let me out of here!

351
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:28,308
Where the hell are you?
Don't you touch my child.

352
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:30,227
Come here!

353
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,445
Okay, now, don't move, okay? There.

354
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:24,781
Oh, looking real good, yeah.

355
00:46:24,866 --> 00:46:27,200
There. There.

356
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:29,077
All done.

357
00:46:29,162 --> 00:46:32,664
Now, there may be some small
problem in depth perception.

358
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:35,417
Well, it better not screw up
my short game.

359
00:46:37,587 --> 00:46:38,587
Well?

360
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:40,297
- Looks good.
- I like it. Yeah.

361
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:43,258
- I like it better than your real eye.
- Much better.

362
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:47,220
- What do you say, Toby? The truth.
- Looks like shit.

363
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:50,056
That's why I love children. No guile.

364
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,438
It does look like shit.

365
00:46:57,482 --> 00:46:59,774
And it feels like cold shit!

366
00:46:59,859 --> 00:47:02,569
- Deacon?
- What...

367
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:07,157
I'm sorry. It's just that
there's a problem in the pit.

368
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:08,867
Maybe you should come.

369
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:15,790
Let's drive.

370
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:26,927
The pit. Don't bother
with the scenic route.

371
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:28,345
Drive!

372
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:31,806
Hey, it's driving better.

373
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,112
Get off!

374
00:47:47,615 --> 00:47:50,242
Get off. Get out of the way.

375
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:52,911
All right, all right, all right.
Okay, okay.

376
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:59,042
Bless you, cousins. Bless you.
Bless all you cousins over there.

377
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,418
Keep up the good work.

378
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:03,463
Growth is progress.
Growth is progress.

379
00:48:03,548 --> 00:48:08,218
Somebody! Hey, up there!

380
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,220
Take it off!

381
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,934
- Yes.
- Your Deaconship.

382
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:18,728
Hello. Good morning.

383
00:48:18,813 --> 00:48:22,440
Or night, whichever the case may be.

384
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:26,319
- What is it? I'm a busy man.
- I thought you should know.

385
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:31,283
We're down to exactly
four feet, nine inches

386
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:33,118
of black stuff.

387
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:38,665
Thank you, sir.

388
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:42,085
- How many G's is that after refining?
- Maybe three refuelers.

389
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:44,796
We'll burn through that in two lunars.
- Sweet Joe!

390
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,174
Will somebody please tell me
what's happening to this place?

391
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:50,510
We outgrowed it.

392
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:55,432
All right, the only thing that
is important is the tattooed girl.

393
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:58,435
We don't spare any go-juice
finding her.

394
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:02,105
We don't waste it anywhere else.
You cancel all those tractor pulls

395
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:04,024
and all that stuff until later.

396
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:05,442
You got it?

397
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:10,155
Dryland is the mother lode.

398
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:12,741
On your toes.

399
00:49:14,327 --> 00:49:15,577
Excellent.

400
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:47,734
- Hi.
- Move.

401
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:50,904
Enola! Enola, come here!

402
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:54,282
Come on!

403
00:49:57,078 --> 00:49:59,204
Enola, come over here.

404
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:14,260
Hey!

405
00:50:17,098 --> 00:50:21,559
- What are you doing?
- Decorating your boat. It's ugly.

406
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:28,024
- Where did you get this?
- From down below.

407
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:31,152
This is mine!
You don't touch anything of mine.

408
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:32,362
I drew it for you.

409
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:34,948
You don't draw on anything.
You understand?

410
00:50:40,204 --> 00:50:41,621
What...

411
00:50:44,417 --> 00:50:47,460
This is my boat.
I got it the way I like it.

412
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:50,213
You take up space
and you slow me down.

413
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:56,761
You know, she's just a little girl.

414
00:50:56,887 --> 00:51:00,014
- She doesn't know your rules.
- You wanna stay?

415
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:01,641
You teach her.

416
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:23,455
Enola, what'd I tell you?

417
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:31,087
You're not so tough. You know that?

418
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:37,677
How many people have you killed?

419
00:51:40,473 --> 00:51:43,349
Ten? Twenty?

420
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:46,234
You talk a lot.

421
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:49,214
I talk a lot 'cause you
don't talk at all.

422
00:51:49,899 --> 00:51:51,608
Now, how many?

423
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:55,028
Including little girls?

424
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,405
I'm not afraid of you.

425
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:04,537
I told Helen you wouldn't be so ugly
if you cut your hair.

426
00:52:08,501 --> 00:52:10,251
In fact, you talk all the time.

427
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,712
- It's like a storm when you're around.
- Enola!

428
00:52:12,797 --> 00:52:14,506
Hey! What are you doing?

429
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:18,760
- Helen!
- You bastard! She can't swim!

430
00:52:19,178 --> 00:52:22,055
Help me! Helen!

431
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:25,308
Helen, help me!

432
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:27,310
Helen!

433
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,063
Helen, help me!

434
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:41,157
Helen! Helen!

435
00:52:41,242 --> 00:52:42,867
Hold on!

436
00:52:43,786 --> 00:52:45,954
Look at me. Look at me. Look at me.

437
00:52:47,373 --> 00:52:51,292
Oh, please, come back. Please!

438
00:52:51,377 --> 00:52:54,504
Please! Oh, please!

439
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:00,760
Hey!

440
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:06,641
Hold on. Okay, almost.

441
00:53:19,989 --> 00:53:24,993
Thanks. I swear,
if you ever touch her again...

442
00:53:25,077 --> 00:53:27,120
You son of a bitch. Look at me.

443
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:29,914
You will go to bed that night
and you will never wake up.

444
00:53:29,999 --> 00:53:32,292
- Shut up.
- What?

445
00:53:33,085 --> 00:53:35,336
- Smokers?
- Yeah.

446
00:53:35,421 --> 00:53:37,672
Can't we outrun them?

447
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:41,593
Not with my sail down.

448
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:01,195
What are you thinking about?

449
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:02,989
That's a nice touch.

450
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:05,158
That's them.

451
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:13,833
Don't hit the kid.

452
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:30,808
Hey!

453
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:38,483
Coward!

454
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:48,618
Fuck!

455
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:18,231
No!

456
00:55:31,996 --> 00:55:32,996
Joe!

457
00:55:40,421 --> 00:55:41,629
Cut it!

458
00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:52,974
Come on! Come on!

459
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:29,218
All right. Okay.

460
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:32,198
Oh, I'm really sorry.

461
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:35,660
I'm sorry. But you didn't
give me much choice.

462
00:57:35,744 --> 00:57:37,078
Oh, I know.

463
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:40,873
But you ran away. I... What?

464
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:44,252
What are you... No! Please, no! No!

465
00:57:54,054 --> 00:57:58,516
Don't ever touch anything
on my boat again.

466
00:58:01,979 --> 00:58:03,896
She said she was sorry!

467
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:11,028
That means you're supposed
to say something back!

468
00:58:33,552 --> 00:58:35,386
- Did you say something?
Mmm-mmm.

469
00:58:59,411 --> 00:59:01,162
The child...
Did he have the girl with him?

470
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:02,330
Uh-huh.

471
00:59:02,414 --> 00:59:06,876
Seems to me if we launch now, we can
cut him down... just about here.

472
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:11,214
- If he doesn't change course.
- It's not likely.

473
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:14,884
He's a wily one, that ichthy-demon.

474
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:17,678
Yeah, if he knows he's been spotted,

475
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:21,599
he'll expect us to expect him
to change course,

476
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:25,186
which is exactly
why he'll keep his heading.

477
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:28,481
The important question is,
where's he heading?

478
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:32,151
And does he know
how precious his cargo is?

479
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:36,447
I say that he's headed here,
and we take him here.

480
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:45,998
Hello!

481
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:49,126
Drifter?

482
00:59:49,211 --> 00:59:50,419
Mmm-hmm.

483
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:52,171
Are we gonna stop?

484
00:59:52,256 --> 00:59:54,173
- Look at the flag!
- His flag's up.

485
00:59:54,258 --> 00:59:56,717
I thought you all
stopped for each other.

486
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:04,642
Well, maybe he has some food!

487
01:00:07,354 --> 01:00:09,730
Don't find many who follow
the rules anymore.

488
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:13,317
Well, make it quick.
What's your business?

489
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:19,615
Trade.

490
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:23,703
You got any resin?

491
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:28,520
Resin? He's gotta be out of his mind.

492
01:00:28,521 --> 01:00:31,402
He's out of his mind completely.
I don't have any resin.

493
01:00:31,795 --> 01:00:34,338
You been outwater a long time,
haven't you?

494
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:38,175
Must be joking me, man. Resin!
You don't got enough.

495
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:39,969
How about food?

496
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:42,013
Could you say that again, please?

497
01:00:42,097 --> 01:00:43,973
How about food?

498
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:47,518
Yeah, food. Yeah, that'd be good, eh?

499
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:50,563
I haven't eaten in,
well, you know, forever.

500
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:56,402
Which one of you two is the cook?
Cause I usually fall for the waitress.

501
01:00:58,447 --> 01:01:00,239
Like you said, I don't have much.

502
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:03,242
I'll say. Let's see.

503
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:06,746
We can start with that wee orchard
you got over there.

504
01:01:09,624 --> 01:01:11,417
All right, hold it there.

505
01:01:12,419 --> 01:01:14,420
- We can talk.
- Fair enough.

506
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:23,054
It's a nice rod, isn't it?

507
01:01:23,138 --> 01:01:25,348
I like that rod. It's a nice rod.

508
01:01:32,606 --> 01:01:35,358
Got yourself a wee harem
going here, now, don't you, eh?

509
01:01:41,782 --> 01:01:43,741
What do you want for the women?

510
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:45,493
We're not for sale.

511
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:49,372
Not for sale?
There's no such thing as not for sale.

512
01:01:49,456 --> 01:01:51,916
"Not for sale"! Not for sale, eh?

513
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:56,879
Are they a pair, or would you consider
selling them separate?

514
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:58,881
No. Our business is done here

515
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:01,133
unless you got some resin
for sale you can part with.

516
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:03,219
I told you once already,
I don't have it.

517
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:05,721
I don't have it.
Don't have it. Don't have it.

518
01:02:05,806 --> 01:02:09,975
Haven't seen that there for trade in
lunars now. Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

519
01:02:13,313 --> 01:02:16,357
I do have something that'll
make you change your mind.

520
01:02:17,192 --> 01:02:19,485
Something that you can't pass on.

521
01:02:21,613 --> 01:02:24,198
I took it off an atoller refugee camp.

522
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:27,493
The life savings of the entire clan.

523
01:02:35,335 --> 01:02:38,337
Paper. Look at my wee paper.

524
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:43,467
It's paper. Have you ever seen paper?
Look at it.

525
01:02:43,552 --> 01:02:44,844
Smell it.

526
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:49,557
I been saving it for a special trade.

527
01:02:52,561 --> 01:02:54,103
Don't you do it.

528
01:02:54,855 --> 01:02:57,773
You know, maybe I'm talking
to the wrong person here.

529
01:02:57,858 --> 01:03:00,651
Whose boat is this?
Is it your boat or your boat?

530
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:03,821
No. No, it's his boat.
But he doesn't own us.

531
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:12,538
Half an hour.

532
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:16,667
Is he out of his mind
or something here?

533
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:18,627
I got two pages in here, man!

534
01:03:18,712 --> 01:03:20,873
I mean, I'd get half a dozen girls
with this, you know.

535
01:03:20,881 --> 01:03:22,047
Half an hour.

536
01:03:23,717 --> 01:03:24,967
You trading or not?

537
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:26,051
Don't.

538
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:27,219
Shut up.

539
01:03:29,181 --> 01:03:30,264
Okay.

540
01:03:32,893 --> 01:03:35,394
Forty-five minutes
with the wee one over there.

541
01:03:35,479 --> 01:03:37,938
I like to do the talking,
if you know what I mean.

542
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:40,316
No!

543
01:03:42,444 --> 01:03:45,779
Fair enough.
Come, come, come, come, come!

544
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:48,407
No. My boat.

545
01:03:50,285 --> 01:03:52,703
Fair enough. Fair enough.
Good, good, good. Aye.

546
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:53,996
Helen.

547
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:57,416
- Sit down.
- Enola, just do as he says.

548
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:45,214
It's been a while for me now.

549
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:49,426
Guess it's been
more than a while, actually.

550
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:57,810
I've only got half an hour. Half an
hour, half an hour, half an hour...

551
01:04:59,229 --> 01:05:01,313
Right, right, right...

552
01:05:02,816 --> 01:05:05,901
You're so beautiful. Aye!
Anyone ever told you that?

553
01:05:05,986 --> 01:05:09,154
Give me that. What are you doing?
It's just a game.

554
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:15,494
Oh, I... I... We was just playing.

555
01:05:18,582 --> 01:05:20,624
The trade's off.

556
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:23,043
I changed my mind.

557
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:26,714
Well, you can't do that.

558
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:29,174
I mean, a deal's a deal, aye?

559
01:05:29,843 --> 01:05:31,760
I just did.

560
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:33,470
Hey!

561
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:38,058
She's mine. Aye. No.
No, no, I won't have it, no.

562
01:05:38,143 --> 01:05:40,978
Go on. Get, get, get.
Go, go, go. Good, good.

563
01:05:41,062 --> 01:05:45,399
But don't go too far, now.
This won't take but a minute.

564
01:05:50,238 --> 01:05:54,950
I hate this boat. I hate this boat!

565
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:57,745
You bastard.

566
01:06:02,876 --> 01:06:07,880
You're pretty stingy for a man who's
got everything, aren't you, now?

567
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:26,398
You bastard!

568
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:42,414
Where's me boat?

569
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:51,799
Help me to me boat.

570
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:56,178
Me boat.

571
01:07:29,337 --> 01:07:30,921
What the... No!

572
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:35,592
Never catch anything
with this. It's useless.

573
01:07:41,683 --> 01:07:46,395
Look, I'm sorry.
You were right about the pole.

574
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:49,982
You were right, but we have to eat.

575
01:07:55,238 --> 01:07:57,239
Now, I know you can hear me!

576
01:07:57,323 --> 01:08:00,826
Now, we can fish for ourselves.
You show us what to do.

577
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:03,537
You must know how. Even you gotta eat!

578
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:05,080
You just sit there.

579
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:30,564
What...

580
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:32,024
I don't know.

581
01:09:08,353 --> 01:09:09,937
Happy now?

582
01:09:28,373 --> 01:09:30,499
You don't like my singing, do you?

583
01:09:33,837 --> 01:09:37,256
Helen says you don't like my singing
'cause you can't sing.

584
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:45,889
- Ever try and listen?
- To what?

585
01:09:48,726 --> 01:09:50,602
The sound of the world.

586
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:58,485
- I don't hear anything.
- That's because you're too loud

587
01:09:58,570 --> 01:10:00,529
and you're moving around all the time.

588
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:02,281
Try sitting still.

589
01:10:04,242 --> 01:10:05,701
Eyeball?

590
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:23,635
I wish I had feet like his.

591
01:10:25,889 --> 01:10:27,681
Then maybe I could swim.

592
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:29,224
Enola.

593
01:10:34,355 --> 01:10:35,647
Sorry.

594
01:10:40,111 --> 01:10:42,571
Never met a person
who couldn't swim before.

595
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:46,491
I can't.

596
01:10:49,037 --> 01:10:50,954
People said I was weird.

597
01:10:51,831 --> 01:10:53,749
Maybe they were right.

598
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:59,338
Maybe they were right about you, too.

599
01:11:27,367 --> 01:11:29,326
Enola wanted to give you this.

600
01:11:33,831 --> 01:11:35,332
And this.

601
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:40,420
She won't take it again.

602
01:11:46,886 --> 01:11:48,804
You don't look much like her.

603
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:52,724
Well, I'm not her mother,
if that's what you're asking.

604
01:11:52,809 --> 01:11:54,184
You act like it.

605
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:59,898
What are those marks on her back?

606
01:11:59,983 --> 01:12:02,985
Nothing. They're just fanciful things.

607
01:12:04,112 --> 01:12:05,612
Like what she draws?

608
01:12:05,697 --> 01:12:07,406
She draws what she sees.

609
01:12:08,199 --> 01:12:09,658
She's like a mirror.

610
01:12:11,077 --> 01:12:13,495
People on the atoll
thought she was a...

611
01:12:15,248 --> 01:12:16,373
Freak?

612
01:12:19,085 --> 01:12:20,252
Yeah.

613
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:22,337
I just thought she was special.

614
01:12:30,722 --> 01:12:34,016
I'm not giving it to her. It's just...

615
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:35,392
A loan.

616
01:12:36,436 --> 01:12:39,271
Yeah. I'm not giving it to her.

617
01:12:44,694 --> 01:12:46,319
Is Dryland beautiful?

618
01:12:49,115 --> 01:12:50,365
You'll see.

619
01:13:17,143 --> 01:13:18,310
Enola?

620
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:21,897
Enola, what are you doing?

621
01:13:21,981 --> 01:13:23,732
Those monsters'll kill her!

622
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:25,484
No, they're asleep now.

623
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:30,072
Hands around my neck.

624
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:34,993
Let the water tell your arms
and legs how to move.

625
01:13:35,495 --> 01:13:37,788
We're going down. Hold your breath.

626
01:15:16,304 --> 01:15:19,973
- What is it?
- What is it?

627
01:15:21,601 --> 01:15:23,727
Barter outpost.

628
01:15:24,103 --> 01:15:26,271
You said we'd get to Dryland today.

629
01:15:26,647 --> 01:15:29,524
Today. Tomorrow. What's it matter?

630
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:32,027
I need resin.

631
01:15:42,413 --> 01:15:43,663
What is that?

632
01:15:43,748 --> 01:15:45,123
It's PortuGreek.

633
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:48,168
Their own language.

634
01:15:50,504 --> 01:15:52,547
Or so I thought.

635
01:16:21,869 --> 01:16:25,121
There's my girl. Yeah.

636
01:16:25,206 --> 01:16:29,084
Howdy, darling. Come on in here now.

637
01:16:58,072 --> 01:17:00,991
- What's going on?
- Smokers.

638
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:05,745
What the hell?

639
01:17:09,542 --> 01:17:12,627
He's spotted us. Sound it!

640
01:17:12,712 --> 01:17:16,631
Sound it! Sound it!
Sound it! Sound it!

641
01:17:37,903 --> 01:17:39,195
Enola!

642
01:17:52,293 --> 01:17:54,294
Starboard side! Now!

643
01:17:55,588 --> 01:17:57,005
Get in the chair!

644
01:18:03,721 --> 01:18:05,764
Watch it. He's clearing the net.

645
01:18:18,069 --> 01:18:19,402
Go to the helm.

646
01:18:22,531 --> 01:18:24,574
- Get the centerboard!
- Centerboard?

647
01:18:24,658 --> 01:18:27,452
What centerboard?
I don't know what to do!

648
01:18:29,914 --> 01:18:31,956
It's too late. Over here!

649
01:18:51,477 --> 01:18:53,103
No!

650
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:11,413
Give me that rifle.

651
01:19:12,331 --> 01:19:17,001
Boy, if you wanna do something right,
you've got to do it yourself.

652
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:18,878
All right.

653
01:19:26,053 --> 01:19:27,345
I winged him.

654
01:19:27,430 --> 01:19:30,932
I say we load all the go-juice
onto one boat and run the freak down.

655
01:19:31,016 --> 01:19:34,602
You can't catch him in ten boats,
and you wanna send just one?

656
01:19:34,687 --> 01:19:37,272
Well, I pray that you're joking.

657
01:19:45,531 --> 01:19:47,282
Bring me the trackers.

658
01:19:53,747 --> 01:19:55,165
He's hurt.

659
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:58,585
It's not what you think.
They weren't after her.

660
01:19:58,669 --> 01:20:00,086
I saw what I saw.

661
01:20:00,171 --> 01:20:01,296
What?

662
01:20:05,468 --> 01:20:07,010
No more lies.

663
01:20:09,597 --> 01:20:11,681
What are the marks on her back?

664
01:20:12,099 --> 01:20:15,310
People say it's the way to Dryland.

665
01:20:15,394 --> 01:20:17,061
Dryland's a myth!

666
01:20:17,146 --> 01:20:20,064
No! You said so yourself
that you know where it is.

667
01:20:20,733 --> 01:20:21,900
You did.

668
01:20:27,031 --> 01:20:30,408
You're a fool to believe in something
you've never seen before.

669
01:20:30,493 --> 01:20:34,662
I've seen it. I've touched it! Dirt
that was richer and darker than yours.

670
01:20:34,747 --> 01:20:36,706
It was in the basket
we found Enola in!

671
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:39,375
- It doesn't exist!
- Well, how can you be so sure?

672
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:44,297
Because I've sailed farther than most
have dreamed, and I've never seen it.

673
01:20:45,925 --> 01:20:47,926
But the things on your boat!

674
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:51,262
"Things on my boat" what?

675
01:20:51,347 --> 01:20:54,766
There are things on your boat
that nobody has ever seen!

676
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:57,060
What are these shells?

677
01:20:57,144 --> 01:21:00,104
And that reflecting glass?

678
01:21:00,189 --> 01:21:03,483
And the music box? That...

679
01:21:04,777 --> 01:21:08,196
Well, if not from Dryland,
then where? Where?

680
01:21:11,242 --> 01:21:12,909
You wanna see Dryland?

681
01:21:14,828 --> 01:21:16,788
You really wanna see it?

682
01:21:18,499 --> 01:21:20,583
I'll take you to Dryland.

683
01:21:28,425 --> 01:21:29,801
Get in.

684
01:21:36,016 --> 01:21:39,227
- Well, what about Enola?
- There's only air for one.

685
01:21:39,311 --> 01:21:41,604
Get in the water. It'll be all right.

686
01:21:47,278 --> 01:21:48,987
Don't touch anything.

687
01:21:53,993 --> 01:21:55,451
Okay?

688
01:25:26,789 --> 01:25:28,247
I didn't know.

689
01:25:30,417 --> 01:25:32,210
All this time...

690
01:25:33,754 --> 01:25:35,588
I didn't know.

691
01:25:35,672 --> 01:25:37,215
Nobody does.

692
01:25:45,557 --> 01:25:47,517
Can you get us out of here?

693
01:25:47,601 --> 01:25:51,103
I'd say there're
two chances of that.

694
01:25:51,188 --> 01:25:53,606
- Hey!
- No way and no how.

695
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:57,401
Should've bought me that drink.
Come on!

696
01:25:57,486 --> 01:25:59,070
This way. Come on!

697
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:08,579
Proper introductions first.

698
01:26:09,414 --> 01:26:10,915
I'm the Deacon.

699
01:26:16,213 --> 01:26:17,990
If you don't recall the face,

700
01:26:17,991 --> 01:26:20,867
perhaps it's 'cause I didn't always
look like this.

701
01:26:24,221 --> 01:26:28,558
Now, I suspect
she's somewhere real close.

702
01:26:28,642 --> 01:26:30,935
So we can tear this boat apart
looking for her,

703
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:33,688
but I'd rather
somebody tell me where she is.

704
01:26:33,772 --> 01:26:36,482
And the first one
that does that lives.

705
01:26:36,567 --> 01:26:41,404
And the runner-up... Well,
actually, there are no runners-up.

706
01:26:43,907 --> 01:26:46,284
Oh, sweet Joe, I love this part.

707
01:26:46,368 --> 01:26:49,453
Choose them. One, two. Live or die.

708
01:26:50,664 --> 01:26:53,833
You know, personally,

709
01:26:53,959 --> 01:26:56,919
I'd rather shoot
the sperm-of-the-devil here.

710
01:26:58,463 --> 01:27:00,256
But you know something?

711
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:02,842
I don't think you're
gonna tell me, are you?

712
01:27:02,926 --> 01:27:04,969
Too bad.

713
01:27:05,971 --> 01:27:09,348
Come on. What do you say?

714
01:27:09,433 --> 01:27:11,475
She's not your kind.

715
01:27:12,978 --> 01:27:15,271
You don't even have a kind.

716
01:27:15,355 --> 01:27:19,108
If you say it,
he'll still kill us both.

717
01:27:23,864 --> 01:27:25,990
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

718
01:27:27,826 --> 01:27:29,744
If you don't tell me,

719
01:27:29,828 --> 01:27:32,830
I swear to Poseidon
I will torch your boat.

720
01:27:39,838 --> 01:27:42,590
Refresh my memory. What
happens when neither of them talks?

721
01:27:42,674 --> 01:27:45,509
Never happened before.
Never happened before.

722
01:27:46,887 --> 01:27:48,220
All right!

723
01:27:48,305 --> 01:27:50,932
If they won't tell us
where she is, do them!

724
01:27:51,016 --> 01:27:53,392
Both of them! Kill them now!

725
01:27:53,477 --> 01:27:54,810
No!

726
01:27:55,228 --> 01:27:56,228
No!

727
01:27:56,313 --> 01:27:58,856
So gullible! Bring her here.

728
01:28:00,859 --> 01:28:03,694
- Take and ye shall receive!
- No! Leave her!

729
01:28:03,779 --> 01:28:06,697
So ends your daily sermonette!

730
01:28:06,782 --> 01:28:10,201
All we gotta do is figure out this
map. Turn her upside down.

731
01:28:10,327 --> 01:28:13,788
- Does that mean anything to you?
- No.

732
01:28:13,872 --> 01:28:17,208
We'll figure it out back at the 'Deez.
Back at the 'Deez, boys.

733
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:19,627
Careful with her. Careful with her!

734
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:22,129
- What about them?
- Do them both.

735
01:28:22,547 --> 01:28:23,798
Torch the boat.

736
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:29,845
We have to go under!

737
01:28:31,932 --> 01:28:33,933
No, I can't breathe like you!

738
01:28:34,726 --> 01:28:36,560
I'll breathe for both of us.

739
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:04,797
Helen!

740
01:29:07,426 --> 01:29:09,051
Helen, help!

741
01:29:09,136 --> 01:29:13,014
Helen! Helen!

742
01:29:44,004 --> 01:29:45,504
My boat.

743
01:29:55,474 --> 01:29:56,807
Enola.

744
01:29:59,644 --> 01:30:02,730
What is this?
Get those chains off her.

745
01:30:02,814 --> 01:30:05,733
What are we, barbarians here?

746
01:30:05,817 --> 01:30:08,194
Goodness gracious. Sakes alive.

747
01:30:08,278 --> 01:30:11,072
Come on out of here,
you big, nasty animal, you!

748
01:30:12,449 --> 01:30:14,325
Well, rub-a-dub-dub.

749
01:30:16,536 --> 01:30:19,038
You wanna come over here
and sit on my lap?

750
01:30:20,290 --> 01:30:21,457
No?

751
01:30:23,001 --> 01:30:24,627
How about a cigarette?

752
01:30:26,671 --> 01:30:29,465
Nothing like a good smoke
if you miss your mom.

753
01:30:29,549 --> 01:30:31,509
Never too young to start.

754
01:30:33,011 --> 01:30:36,764
No. Well, I got something
right here I know you'd like.

755
01:30:38,266 --> 01:30:40,142
Like to draw, don't you?

756
01:30:44,648 --> 01:30:46,190
Now, they're yours,

757
01:30:47,526 --> 01:30:51,904
if you help me with
just one problem, all right?

758
01:30:54,199 --> 01:30:57,827
Now, that tattoo on your back...

759
01:30:59,704 --> 01:31:04,625
I've been told that
that's actually a map?

760
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:09,463
It's the way to Dryland.

761
01:31:09,548 --> 01:31:11,382
Now we're getting someplace.

762
01:31:13,385 --> 01:31:16,554
Could you teach me how to read that?

763
01:31:18,974 --> 01:31:20,182
Setback.

764
01:31:23,228 --> 01:31:27,398
Well, have you ever heard
any of your friends talk about it?

765
01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:31,110
You know, like your mommy
or your pet fish?

766
01:31:31,194 --> 01:31:32,653
Did he say anything?

767
01:31:32,737 --> 01:31:35,239
You shouldn't make fun of him.
He wouldn't like it.

768
01:31:35,323 --> 01:31:40,244
Girl, I don't give a shit what
he'd like. He took out my eye.

769
01:31:40,745 --> 01:31:42,204
And if I ever see him again,

770
01:31:42,289 --> 01:31:46,667
I'm gonna cut open his head
and eat his brains!

771
01:31:46,751 --> 01:31:48,961
You think he'd like that?

772
01:31:49,045 --> 01:31:52,923
Can't kill him.
He's even meaner than you are.

773
01:31:53,717 --> 01:31:55,968
But he's not here.

774
01:31:56,052 --> 01:31:58,012
And he ain't coming.

775
01:31:58,096 --> 01:32:00,264
And no one's gonna save you.

776
01:32:01,433 --> 01:32:03,350
He'll come for me. He will.

777
01:32:03,435 --> 01:32:05,978
Then you better tell me
what I wanna know

778
01:32:06,062 --> 01:32:09,607
or he can see what's left of you
in a goddamn jar.

779
01:32:19,951 --> 01:32:22,077
We're going to die here, aren't we?

780
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:43,432
Aren't we?

781
01:32:53,235 --> 01:32:55,069
After the atoll,

782
01:32:56,196 --> 01:32:58,322
when I offered myself to you,

783
01:33:01,493 --> 01:33:03,285
why didn't you take me?

784
01:33:05,789 --> 01:33:07,873
'Cause you didn't really want me.

785
01:33:10,043 --> 01:33:11,418
Not really.

786
01:35:08,453 --> 01:35:10,120
Have I been asleep long?

787
01:35:16,461 --> 01:35:17,920
I was dreaming.

788
01:35:21,091 --> 01:35:22,383
It's funny.

789
01:35:24,052 --> 01:35:26,136
I always thought Dryland floated.

790
01:35:26,805 --> 01:35:30,682
That it drifted with the wind.
That's why it was so hard to find.

791
01:35:30,767 --> 01:35:33,018
Why did you believe in it so much?

792
01:35:34,312 --> 01:35:36,647
Because we weren't made for the sea.

793
01:35:38,191 --> 01:35:41,443
Got hands and feet.

794
01:35:41,528 --> 01:35:43,278
We're supposed to walk.

795
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,826
I miss her sound.

796
01:35:51,496 --> 01:35:52,663
Don't you?

797
01:35:56,418 --> 01:35:57,793
Helen!

798
01:35:58,837 --> 01:36:01,839
No, no, no.
Helen, up here. Above you!

799
01:36:02,006 --> 01:36:03,841
Gregor!

800
01:36:09,097 --> 01:36:11,473
Smart thinking, to burn your boat.

801
01:36:11,558 --> 01:36:15,310
Without the smoke,
I never would have found you.

802
01:36:15,395 --> 01:36:17,521
Who's that with you?

803
01:36:17,605 --> 01:36:20,858
Ichthyus sapien, is that really you?

804
01:36:21,734 --> 01:36:25,571
I'll throw the rope down.
You catch it. I'll help you climb up.

805
01:36:27,365 --> 01:36:31,452
Helen. Where's Enola?

806
01:36:31,536 --> 01:36:36,498
Smokers took her. They'd have me, too,
if it weren't for him.

807
01:36:36,583 --> 01:36:40,919
My friend, thank you.
Very human of you.

808
01:36:42,297 --> 01:36:44,965
Go grab your things quickly.
Quickly. Come.

809
01:36:53,266 --> 01:36:55,350
You see? Right down there.

810
01:36:55,435 --> 01:36:58,812
There's several of us survivors.
We'll just start over again.

811
01:37:00,565 --> 01:37:02,149
You can't ask us to go get her!

812
01:37:02,233 --> 01:37:03,817
Enola's the reason
we're in all this trouble.

813
01:37:03,902 --> 01:37:05,302
Forget it! We're not going.

814
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:06,904
They don't have any
reason to kill her.

815
01:37:06,988 --> 01:37:09,490
They need to find Dryland
just like we do.

816
01:37:09,574 --> 01:37:10,908
Of course.

817
01:37:10,992 --> 01:37:13,660
If the Mariner's
willing to go, why not us?

818
01:37:13,745 --> 01:37:15,454
If he wants to go,
then let him!

819
01:37:15,538 --> 01:37:18,081
We don't want you
here! You or the girl!

820
01:37:19,083 --> 01:37:23,587
Helen. The papers
the Mariner brought you...

821
01:37:23,671 --> 01:37:27,257
It's the same language
the tattoo is written in.

822
01:37:27,342 --> 01:37:28,550
They're numbers.

823
01:37:28,676 --> 01:37:31,720
- Gregor, you're as crazy as she is!
- We can't stay here!

824
01:37:31,804 --> 01:37:33,013
We're wasting valuable time.

825
01:37:33,097 --> 01:37:35,390
More Smokers will come.
We need to be moving now!

826
01:37:35,475 --> 01:37:39,686
My friends, don't you see we need this
child if we want to find Dryland?

827
01:37:39,771 --> 01:37:41,813
I'm not going. Nobody is.

828
01:37:41,898 --> 01:37:44,316
We've seen
their smoke on the horizon!

829
01:37:44,442 --> 01:37:47,194
- Know what that is yet?
- The number? Yes, I think I do.

830
01:37:47,278 --> 01:37:51,031
It seems to be some ancient form
of geographic location,

831
01:37:51,115 --> 01:37:52,658
latitude, longitude.

832
01:37:52,742 --> 01:37:54,284
It doesn't make sense, though.

833
01:37:54,369 --> 01:37:57,579
The numbers, they seem to be
backwards or something.

834
01:37:57,664 --> 01:37:59,915
- It's upside down.
- The world?

835
01:37:59,999 --> 01:38:02,584
The poles have reversed themselves?

836
01:38:02,669 --> 01:38:04,836
I've been mapping the cities below.

837
01:38:07,465 --> 01:38:11,134
The world wasn't created in a deluge.
It was covered by it.

838
01:38:11,219 --> 01:38:14,346
- That's blasphemy!
- No, it's true.

839
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:19,226
I've seen it with my own eyes. There
is land. It's right under our keel.

840
01:38:19,310 --> 01:38:21,478
- None of it's dry anymore.
- Some is.

841
01:38:23,106 --> 01:38:27,276
Enola's been there. I know that now.
I saw what she drew.

842
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:31,488
So that's why he's going after Enola,
to find Dryland.

843
01:38:32,115 --> 01:38:34,157
I don't care about Dryland.

844
01:38:34,242 --> 01:38:37,077
This is ridiculous.
Going after the Smokers?

845
01:38:37,161 --> 01:38:39,201
He doesn't even know which direction
they came from.

846
01:38:39,205 --> 01:38:40,126
I say let him go.

847
01:38:40,127 --> 01:38:42,441
We're better off without
them anyway!

848
01:38:44,085 --> 01:38:46,670
If she's alive,
I'll bring her back to you.

849
01:38:48,256 --> 01:38:52,509
Forget the mute-o, Helen.
If he brings her back they'll kill us!

850
01:38:52,594 --> 01:38:56,597
I can't stand it. We gotta go help
him. I can't ask him to do this alone.

851
01:38:56,681 --> 01:39:00,517
Oh, don't worry, my dear.
You're not going to have to.

852
01:39:06,774 --> 01:39:09,276
You got that tattoo figured out yet?

853
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:12,404
It would be easier
if it was flat, big and flat.

854
01:39:12,488 --> 01:39:15,282
- It needs to be flat.
- What you got in mind?

855
01:39:15,366 --> 01:39:19,661
Well, you cut it off her back.
You stretch it, mount it.

856
01:39:19,787 --> 01:39:20,754
Give us a proper look.

857
01:39:20,755 --> 01:39:23,315
Take her down
below until I holler.

858
01:39:24,375 --> 01:39:26,293
Saint Joe, we're close.

859
01:39:28,046 --> 01:39:30,297
After centuries of shame.

860
01:41:00,763 --> 01:41:03,724
- They're getting ugly.
- Don't I know it.

861
01:41:04,726 --> 01:41:06,810
Announce me, cousin.

862
01:41:11,232 --> 01:41:12,899
Hey. Here he is.

863
01:41:12,984 --> 01:41:14,776
Deacon!

864
01:41:14,861 --> 01:41:17,612
Rise up, brothers and sisters.

865
01:41:19,157 --> 01:41:22,534
Turn your eyes and open your hearts

866
01:41:22,618 --> 01:41:24,995
to your humble benefactor,

867
01:41:25,079 --> 01:41:28,790
your spiritual shepherd
and dictator for life,

868
01:41:28,875 --> 01:41:31,626
the Deacon of the 'Deez.

869
01:42:03,201 --> 01:42:04,785
Deacon!

870
01:42:06,871 --> 01:42:10,791
Children. Children of the provider.

871
01:42:12,376 --> 01:42:16,379
Citizens of the good ship.
Please, now, hear me speak.

872
01:42:20,426 --> 01:42:23,470
- I've had a vision.
- Yeah, we're tired of your visions!

873
01:42:23,554 --> 01:42:25,430
What about the land you promised us?

874
01:42:25,515 --> 01:42:28,558
Yeah!

875
01:42:28,643 --> 01:42:31,186
Oh, ye of little faith.

876
01:42:31,270 --> 01:42:33,522
I've had a vision so great

877
01:42:33,606 --> 01:42:36,983
that as it came to me, I wept.

878
01:42:37,068 --> 01:42:39,402
And in this splenditudinous
figment of wonder...

879
01:42:39,487 --> 01:42:40,737
Is that Bone's ride?

880
01:42:40,822 --> 01:42:43,365
- Is that blood on the seat?
...I saw.

881
01:42:43,449 --> 01:42:47,160
And you know what it is that I saw.

882
01:42:47,245 --> 01:42:51,498
I saw the land.

883
01:43:24,156 --> 01:43:25,532
Horse, that you?

884
01:43:30,955 --> 01:43:34,207
Look, just bring it in slow,
okay? I don't have all day.

885
01:43:36,669 --> 01:43:37,878
Horse!

886
01:43:37,962 --> 01:43:39,546
Just bring it up slow.

887
01:43:41,424 --> 01:43:44,217
I said slow! No, Horse!

888
01:43:49,015 --> 01:43:52,350
Shouldn't be doing that.
You're gonna get in trouble.

889
01:43:53,811 --> 01:43:55,312
That's right.

890
01:43:55,396 --> 01:43:56,730
You're not afraid.

891
01:43:56,814 --> 01:43:59,566
You've got your pet freak
coming to rescue you.

892
01:43:59,650 --> 01:44:02,235
He's not a freak,
and he can take you anytime.

893
01:44:04,113 --> 01:44:08,366
He's killed dozens of people, and he
doesn't have any mercy or anything.

894
01:44:08,451 --> 01:44:10,535
He even kills little girls.

895
01:44:12,455 --> 01:44:13,997
Haven't we all?

896
01:44:15,583 --> 01:44:16,708
Shit.

897
01:44:18,002 --> 01:44:19,127
It's Horse.

898
01:44:21,505 --> 01:44:23,798
- Find him. Find him!
- Come on!

899
01:44:26,052 --> 01:44:28,720
Yes! Yes! Yes!

900
01:44:28,804 --> 01:44:32,265
- Come on.
- Getting nervous, aren't you?

901
01:44:36,395 --> 01:44:37,854
I don't get nervous.

902
01:44:39,690 --> 01:44:42,359
And if there's
a river, we'll dam it.

903
01:44:42,443 --> 01:44:46,321
And if there's a tree, we'll ram it.

904
01:44:47,156 --> 01:44:49,866
'Cause I'm talking progress here.

905
01:44:49,951 --> 01:44:53,161
Yes, sir. I'm talking development.

906
01:44:53,245 --> 01:44:54,287
Yeah!

907
01:44:54,372 --> 01:44:59,125
For we shall suck and savor
the sweet flavor

908
01:44:59,210 --> 01:45:01,878
of Dryland.

909
01:45:02,171 --> 01:45:03,880
Face is all red.

910
01:45:05,549 --> 01:45:08,760
Helen said with anybody
that has a face that red,

911
01:45:08,844 --> 01:45:11,179
he's had too much sun
or too much to drink.

912
01:45:11,305 --> 01:45:13,825
All right, that's it. I'm gonna burn

913
01:45:13,826 --> 01:45:15,291
- your face.
- Almost time.

914
01:45:16,811 --> 01:45:18,019
What's up?

915
01:45:18,104 --> 01:45:20,230
We're just talking about her friend.

916
01:45:21,649 --> 01:45:24,943
- What's his name?
- He doesn't have a name.

917
01:45:25,027 --> 01:45:27,070
So death can't find him.

918
01:45:32,702 --> 01:45:35,245
Doesn't have a home
or people to care for.

919
01:45:36,414 --> 01:45:40,000
He's not afraid of anything,
men least of all.

920
01:45:40,084 --> 01:45:43,336
He's fast and strong like a big wind.

921
01:45:43,421 --> 01:45:47,173
He can hear 100 miles
and see 100 miles underwater.

922
01:45:47,258 --> 01:45:49,759
He can hide in the shadow
of the noon sun.

923
01:45:50,594 --> 01:45:54,597
He could be right behind you, and you
won't even know it till you're dead!

924
01:45:56,934 --> 01:45:58,226
Give it a rest.

925
01:46:00,312 --> 01:46:02,355
He'll come for me. He will.

926
01:46:02,440 --> 01:46:05,066
- We are the reason.
- Yeah?

927
01:46:05,151 --> 01:46:08,319
- Well, I hope he does.
- The Lord's creation.

928
01:46:10,406 --> 01:46:12,115
Remember you said that.

929
01:46:12,950 --> 01:46:14,659
Look at us.

930
01:46:15,619 --> 01:46:18,038
- Look at us here today.
- Yeah!

931
01:46:18,122 --> 01:46:21,833
Dryland is not just our destination,

932
01:46:22,460 --> 01:46:25,003
but it is our destiny!

933
01:46:33,637 --> 01:46:36,139
Find him. Find him!

934
01:46:36,223 --> 01:46:40,935
How can I find this glorious place?

935
01:46:41,479 --> 01:46:43,271
And he said to me,

936
01:46:44,398 --> 01:46:48,651
"A child shall lead you."

937
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:52,072
A child.

938
01:46:52,156 --> 01:46:54,491
- And behold!
- It's time.

939
01:46:55,076 --> 01:46:57,911
The instrument of our salvation!

940
01:47:05,002 --> 01:47:07,587
Our guide in the wild.

941
01:47:07,671 --> 01:47:10,090
Our beacon in the darkness.

942
01:47:10,174 --> 01:47:12,092
Turn her around, Nord.

943
01:47:12,176 --> 01:47:14,969
She has shown me the path!

944
01:47:19,225 --> 01:47:22,894
And before the holy-most
moment is upon us,

945
01:47:22,978 --> 01:47:26,689
let's sacrifice one to old Saint Joe.

946
01:47:29,693 --> 01:47:32,946
And let's get this tub of shit
up to speed.

947
01:47:39,495 --> 01:47:40,578
Yeah.

948
01:48:19,118 --> 01:48:19,618
Pull!

949
01:48:24,081 --> 01:48:26,249
- Pull.
- Pull!

950
01:48:45,978 --> 01:48:49,272
- So which way we rowing?
- I don't have a goddamn clue.

951
01:48:49,356 --> 01:48:51,065
Don't worry.

952
01:48:51,150 --> 01:48:54,319
They'll row for a month
before they figure out I'm faking it.

953
01:48:54,403 --> 01:48:57,197
But why?

954
01:48:57,281 --> 01:48:58,781
Oh, you want details.

955
01:48:58,866 --> 01:49:00,266
Well, I'm not telling these savages

956
01:49:00,326 --> 01:49:02,535
that we haven't solved the map yet.

957
01:49:02,620 --> 01:49:03,995
I promised them results,

958
01:49:04,079 --> 01:49:07,665
and I'll get them if I gotta cut them
out of her goddamn back.

959
01:49:10,252 --> 01:49:12,795
Who is that? Who is that?

960
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:16,799
Maybe one of the spare rowers?

961
01:49:24,475 --> 01:49:26,392
Why aren't you rowing?

962
01:49:35,819 --> 01:49:37,987
- It's him.
- It is him.

963
01:49:39,198 --> 01:49:41,366
You guys are in so much trouble.

964
01:49:44,745 --> 01:49:47,956
Well, I'll be damned.
It's the gentleman guppy.

965
01:49:49,166 --> 01:49:51,709
You know, he's like a turd
that won't flush.

966
01:49:52,878 --> 01:49:54,295
I want the girl.

967
01:49:58,217 --> 01:50:02,887
You know, I thought
you were stupid, friend.

968
01:50:04,014 --> 01:50:06,391
But I underestimated you.

969
01:50:06,475 --> 01:50:09,769
You're a total freaking retard.

970
01:50:12,690 --> 01:50:16,401
I want the girl. That's all.

971
01:50:16,485 --> 01:50:20,530
Well, what on this screwed-up earth
makes you think you're gonna get her?

972
01:50:28,831 --> 01:50:30,581
You know what this is?

973
01:50:35,296 --> 01:50:37,880
I drop it, you burn.

974
01:50:38,215 --> 01:50:41,718
We all burn.
Now, wait, wait, wait, wait.

975
01:50:43,095 --> 01:50:45,722
Let's not do anything rash here.

976
01:50:45,806 --> 01:50:48,308
I mean, are you sure
she's worth all this?

977
01:50:48,392 --> 01:50:51,561
She never does stop talking.
She never shuts up.

978
01:50:52,313 --> 01:50:55,398
- I noticed.
- What is it, then?

979
01:50:55,983 --> 01:50:57,442
It's the map.

980
01:50:58,402 --> 01:50:59,736
She's my friend.

981
01:51:01,196 --> 01:51:04,198
Golly gee. A single tear
rolls down my cheek.

982
01:51:04,283 --> 01:51:06,743
I mean, you're gonna
die for your friend?

983
01:51:08,620 --> 01:51:10,121
If it comes to that.

984
01:51:12,499 --> 01:51:14,334
He's bluffing. I'll kill him.

985
01:51:14,418 --> 01:51:16,586
He's not bluffing. He never bluffs.

986
01:51:16,670 --> 01:51:17,962
Shut up!

987
01:51:20,341 --> 01:51:24,135
I don't think you're gonna
drop that torch, my friend.

988
01:51:25,012 --> 01:51:28,222
- Why not?
- Because you're not crazy.

989
01:51:32,102 --> 01:51:33,853
No!

990
01:51:41,612 --> 01:51:43,321
Oh, thank God.

991
01:52:02,132 --> 01:52:04,050
Look out!

992
01:52:04,134 --> 01:52:05,551
That's him!

993
01:52:06,762 --> 01:52:08,679
Let's go, God damn it!

994
01:52:12,142 --> 01:52:14,977
Don't just stand there!
Kill something!

995
01:52:18,023 --> 01:52:19,774
Was this your big vision?

996
01:52:28,867 --> 01:52:32,286
I've always wanted
to drive this monster.

997
01:52:35,666 --> 01:52:38,000
There he is! There he is!

998
01:52:42,172 --> 01:52:43,923
That's him! There!

999
01:52:57,646 --> 01:53:00,523
Let me go! Let go!

1000
01:53:10,993 --> 01:53:12,118
Let go!

1001
01:53:16,582 --> 01:53:19,333
- Let me go! Let go!
- Pilot!

1002
01:53:19,418 --> 01:53:21,544
- Pilot!
- Let me go!

1003
01:53:21,628 --> 01:53:22,128
Let go!

1004
01:53:28,719 --> 01:53:31,721
You should've stayed underwater.

1005
01:53:40,981 --> 01:53:44,734
Now, you know how to fly an airplane?
You're lucky I do.

1006
01:53:45,903 --> 01:53:48,404
Now, you stop it!
You behave yourself, now!

1007
01:55:20,872 --> 01:55:22,540
It's going down.

1008
01:55:22,624 --> 01:55:24,727
- You can see it sinking.
- Gregor,

1009
01:55:24,753 --> 01:55:27,194
bring us right down on top of it.

1010
01:55:27,671 --> 01:55:29,755
- Hurry, Gregor!
- Don't worry.

1011
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:30,840
Hurry.

1012
01:55:44,980 --> 01:55:47,231
Enola! Up here!

1013
01:55:47,316 --> 01:55:48,608
Grab on!

1014
01:55:54,072 --> 01:55:55,823
Are they on yet?

1015
01:55:59,453 --> 01:56:01,662
What is it?
I don't know!

1016
01:56:13,717 --> 01:56:17,928
Got you! I'm gonna rip
your cute little lungs out.

1017
01:56:33,278 --> 01:56:35,321
Pull! Almost.

1018
01:57:15,737 --> 01:57:18,489
- No! Enola!
- No!

1019
01:57:20,742 --> 01:57:22,993
Saint Joe. Hole in one.

1020
01:57:23,078 --> 01:57:24,161
Helen!

1021
01:57:24,246 --> 01:57:25,830
No! Enola!

1022
01:57:26,081 --> 01:57:27,373
Helen!

1023
01:57:27,791 --> 01:57:29,792
Hey! Hey!

1024
01:57:36,466 --> 01:57:39,760
Oh, no! Quick!
What are we gonna do?

1025
01:57:43,598 --> 01:57:44,932
Tie this off.

1026
01:57:49,688 --> 01:57:51,647
Hurry! Tie it!

1027
01:57:57,237 --> 01:57:58,404
Got it!

1028
01:58:12,544 --> 01:58:13,919
Get them up now.

1029
01:58:25,599 --> 01:58:28,267
- Of course! North is south.
- What?

1030
01:58:28,351 --> 01:58:29,477
South is north.

1031
01:58:29,561 --> 01:58:30,853
I was swimming.

1032
01:58:31,855 --> 01:58:34,106
- I saw.
- My friends.

1033
01:58:34,191 --> 01:58:36,108
My friends, look.

1034
01:58:36,193 --> 01:58:37,943
If I take a bearing from the sun

1035
01:58:38,028 --> 01:58:40,863
and reverse the coordinates
on Enola's back,

1036
01:58:43,116 --> 01:58:45,201
then Dryland is that way!

1037
02:00:49,576 --> 02:00:50,910
It's fresh!

1038
02:00:50,994 --> 02:00:53,662
All of this! It's fresh!

1039
02:01:09,554 --> 02:01:11,513
I found something!

1040
02:01:24,819 --> 02:01:27,196
Maybe we should put them
under the dirt.

1041
02:01:28,365 --> 02:01:30,115
I think it was their way.

1042
02:01:32,535 --> 02:01:34,662
They must have known they were dying.

1043
02:02:05,360 --> 02:02:06,652
I'm home.

1044
02:02:18,123 --> 02:02:20,749
- Where's the Mariner?
- He was outside.

1045
02:02:25,922 --> 02:02:28,632
Wait. Wait! I want to show you this.

1046
02:03:41,331 --> 02:03:43,999
First time in your life
you got nothing to say?

1047
02:03:58,515 --> 02:04:00,224
Enola, I have to go now.

1048
02:04:01,392 --> 02:04:03,143
But you came back for me.

1049
02:04:05,230 --> 02:04:06,522
I like you.

1050
02:04:12,237 --> 02:04:13,862
Why are you leaving?

1051
02:04:17,367 --> 02:04:19,051
I don't belong here.
I belong out there.

1052
02:04:19,052 --> 02:04:21,061
You belong here.

1053
02:04:23,957 --> 02:04:26,583
It's too strange here.
It doesn't move right.

1054
02:04:27,377 --> 02:04:30,254
Helen said that
it's only landsickness.

1055
02:04:31,131 --> 02:04:34,007
We're all feeling it.
It'll go away soon.

1056
02:04:34,843 --> 02:04:36,385
It's more than that.
