1
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:02,538
Pull over to the side!

2
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,256
That old lady is crazy.

3
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:14,217
You can say that again.

4
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:16,594
Get her.

5
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,513
Can you believe this?

6
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:20,348
Good morning, all.

7
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:21,766
Good morning.

8
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,936
l trust we reviewed
our cases over the weekend?

9
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,020
-Yes.
-Yes.

10
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,272
l see you're watching
that Mabel Simmons case.

11
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:31,442
-lt's all over the news.
-Right.

12
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:35,988
Now, that old woman has been giving
the police the blues all of her life.

13
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,743
-She was an ugly baby.
-Okay.

14
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,788
-Petty theft at nine.
-My goodness.

15
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,582
lllegal gambling at 1 8.

16
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,334
That afro is thirsty.

17
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:51,504
-Check fraud.
-Not bad. Not bad.

18
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:54,131
-ldentity theft.
-Lord, help her.

19
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:55,591
lnsurance fraud.

20
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,718
Okay, everything except attempted murder.

21
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:00,429
-Attempted murder.
-Here we go!

22
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:01,722
Goodness!

23
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:03,975
-Assault.
-Nice.

24
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:08,729
The list goes on and on.
And so on and so on.

25
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:13,651
Unfortunately, our fine officers may have
made a mistake on her takedown,

26
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:18,364
so we have to handle this with care.
Who wants it?

27
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:24,161
Don't all volunteer at the same time.

28
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,830
You're supposed to be
helping me out with this.

29
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,583
We have no volunteers
for the Simmons case?

30
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:31,752
Okay.

31
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:34,589
Linda. lt's all yours.

32
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,966
-Thank you.
-God.

33
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,509
-Stop laughing.
-By the way,

34
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:43,222
let's congratulate our Linda Davis
on her 89% conviction rate.

35
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:45,474
Thank you.

36
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:48,728
With numbers like that,
you'll be D.A. one day.

37
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,855
-Okay.
-That's my girl.

38
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:55,526
Everyone else, let's check the boards
for the new cases, and let's get to court.

39
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:56,944
All right.

40
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:03,200
Honey, there goes our appointment.

41
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,828
l know. And you're just
all broke up about it, aren't you?

42
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,830
l am. You know what?
l've got a lot of work anyway.

43
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,373
l know. That's all right.

44
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,751
l guess after this case,
it's just you and me, Tanya.

45
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:16,547
Oh, good. That'll give me time to talk you
out of these taffeta bridesmaids dresses.

46
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:18,925
You like them, don't you, baby?

47
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,844
Take my advice, just nod and say yes.

48
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,388
-Of course...
-You're weak.

49
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:26,307
-He's smart. You're smart.
-Unbelievable.

50
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,558
l'm smart.

51
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:29,393
-Thank you.
-All right, l'll see you later.

52
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,312
-All right.
-Excuse me.

53
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,314
-And you have fun with that.
-Thank you.

54
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:35,650
So...

55
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,195
-You set a date.
-Yes, l set a date.

56
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,113
You know you're gonna
need a best man, right?

57
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:42,531
l told you, l got brothers.

58
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:46,118
Okay, but your brothers have not been the
kind of friend that l've been to you, man.

59
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,955
Chuck, the only reason
why you want to be in my wedding

60
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,414
is 'cause you want to be seen.

61
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:53,084
That hurts. That really hurts.

62
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:54,418
But you are right.

63
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:56,712
Linda's parents, they're loaded, Josh.

64
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,339
l know the governor's gonna be there,

65
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,091
-l know the mayor's gonna be there.
-Get out of here, man.

66
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:01,759
Come on, man. Hook your boy up.

67
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,219
-Please, l need you to be my usher.
-Please.

68
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,096
-But l don't want... Listen.
-That's an important job.

69
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,305
What could l say...

70
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:09,600
l just don't... l just don't know, Cora.

71
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:11,352
l just don't know.

72
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,272
Uncle Joe, are you all right?

73
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,193
Uncle Joe?

74
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,072
Breathe, Joe. Breathe.

75
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,202
You okay?

76
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,872
l'm good, Cora. Turn that oxygen up.

77
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,500
Now, you're not supposed
to be smoking around oxygen.

78
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:35,710
That's the problem.

79
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:38,295
Oxygen is everywhere in the air.

80
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,798
Every time you light a cigarette,
you lighting it in oxygen.

81
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,800
lf you ain't got no oxygen,
the fire won't work.

82
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,261
Learn some chimistry, honey.
Learn some chimistry.

83
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,345
Chemistry.

84
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,765
What the hell you talking about?
You don't know what you're talking about.

85
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,935
This help my blood pressure.

86
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,895
That what the doctor say.
Smoke to help my blood pressure.

87
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,314
You gonna fool around and blow you
and your blood pressure up.

88
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,649
That's right.

89
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:01,652
This here is good for you. lt's good for you.

90
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:03,821
lt came straight down from heaven.

91
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,031
God sent it down.

92
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,533
And he sent Viagra, he sent this,
and he sent that oxygen.

93
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:11,078
And if you put them all together,
you'll take a woman to heaven and back.

94
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:12,329
Thank you.

95
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:14,206
Joe, how you gonna
sit there and talk about God

96
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,459
with a joint in your hand and some Viagra?

97
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,336
God made this.

98
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,422
He made the birds and the bees

99
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,090
and the flowers.

100
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:24,383
And these trees.

101
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:28,345
Joe, you just like your sister.
Both of y'all going to hell!

102
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,058
-What?
-Uncle Joe?

103
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,476
-You want some?
-Joe, l...

104
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,436
No, l need you to focus, Uncle Joe.

105
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:36,562
Focus on what?

106
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,565
Why were y'all running from the police?
Madea? What happened?

107
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,776
Mabel always run from the police.
Cora, you know that.

108
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,527
Your mama been running from the police.

109
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:47,239
She's a ho. Po-po...
When the po-po come, she run like a ho.

110
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:49,200
You mama always been
running from the police.

111
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:51,786
l'm sorry to tell you,
but your mama's a po-po ho.

112
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,080
That fool is a thug.

113
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,706
Cora, that's right. Your mama a gangster.

114
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,209
King Kong ain't got nothing on her.
Got nothing on her.

115
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:01,462
Daddy!

116
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:02,588
Stop talking about my mama.

117
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,423
-l'm not talking about her.
-You going...

118
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:05,925
-Hey, Brown, Cora, how you all doing?
-Hey, Brian.

119
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,301
-Hey, Brian.
-l just saw the news.

120
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,886
What is going on with you and Madea?

121
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,473
What's happening? Are you all right?

122
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,641
No, l ain't all right.

123
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:14,809
What's wrong?

124
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,436
l can't feel my big toes.

125
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,688
Thank you, Lord.

l tell you what.

127
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:25,569
When your parents get to be a certain age,
it's like raising children.

128
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:28,364
My kids don't give me as much trouble
as you and Madea giving me.

129
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,741
What is the matter with you?
Have you done lost your mind?

130
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:33,619
And Madea is already on probation.
l don't know what she was thinking about.

131
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:34,995
That ain't never stopped your mama before.

132
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,455
l done got her out of trouble
three times already.

133
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,665
Yeah. That's true. That's true.

134
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,835
Well, she's going to jail this time.
To the big house! Prisoner. The slammer.

135
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,754
They gonna lock her up, press her down,
and shake her together and run it over.

136

Gonna be in her bosom, l'm telling you...

137
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,340

00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:49,426
Too much?

139
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:50,886
-Yes.
-Yes.

140
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:54,849
Wait. You all go ahead.
Finish saying what you all was saying.

Oh, no. l got to go.
They gonna put her in Alcatraz.

Get the hell on out of here.

You better behave yourself

00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,170

City of Atlanta vs Washington.

155
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,184
Ms. Washington,
you were arrested for prostitution.

156
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,602
Yes, Your Honor, she was.

157
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:43,939
Ms. Washington was arrested
several times before.

158
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,652
Candy?

159
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,116
Joshua?

160
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:59,121

Then give it to one of your colleagues.

00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,589
-Hey, what's going on?
-l know her.

00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,091
How?

lt's a long story. But will you take it?

166
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:16,764
What's the case?

167
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:18,682
Simple prostitution.

168
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,976
All right. But then you have to
take my drunk and disorderly.

169
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,102
-Fine.
-And then you have to

170
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,813

arrested twice for prostitution.

172
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:29,985
The People request no bail.

173
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,738
Your Honor, this woman was simply
walking home from the bus stop when...

174
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:37,993
Save it. Save it. Bail is set at $1 ,500,
cash or bond, until trial date.

175
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:41,538
-$1 ,500?
-Yes. $1 ,500.

176
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:44,124
Ms. Washington,
if you manage to make bail,

177
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,835
you better be back here for your trial.
Do you hear me?

178
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:48,671
-Yeah.
-lf you're not here,

179
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,130
you will regret it.

180
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,883
Go see the clerk for your trial date.

181
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,101
Next case.

182
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,937
City of Atlanta vs Mabel Simmons.

183
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,897
Hey, Cora. Hey, Brown.

184
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,359
lf the Lord get me out of this,
l'm going by the church.

185
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,653
-You better mean it, too.
-l'm going by the church.

186
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,863
-You better mean it.
-l mean it.

187
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,491
Hey, Judge. Girl, your hair is so pretty.

188
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,743
Who doing your hair? Lord have mercy.

189
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,078
How you doing?

190
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,746
Mabel Simmons, you come before me

191
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,415
more than you go
to the doctor for a checkup.

192
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:25,582
Listen, l done changed my life.

193
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:28,127
You ain't got to say nothing.
l am living for the Lord.

194
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:31,922
l am living for the Lord.
l am living for the Lord.

195
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:33,007
Hallelujer.

196
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,342
l feel Him down in my spirit.

197
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:38,887
You know, as l think
about the goodness of Jesus

198
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:42,599
and all that he has done for me,

199
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:47,313
my soul cries out,
"Hallelujer! Thank God for saving me."

200
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:48,856
You finished?

201
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:54,486
l don't believe that no more
than l believe that you'll stay out of trouble.

202
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,864
-Your Honor...
-Save it. l saw the video.

203
00:10:56,948 --> 00:11:01,618
And l told you that if she came back
before me again, she was going to jail.

204
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:02,786
She's going to jail this time.

205
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:04,288
Your weak ass.
You supposed to be a lawyer.

206
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,457
You supposed to be getting me off.
Weak ass.

207
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,543
l gotta get me a real lawyer.
Some Matt Johnson or somebody.

208
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,253
You weak-ass lawyer.

209
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,088
Oh, Lord.

210
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,049
Your Honor, there's something
you need to understand, though...

211
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,842
Brian, there's nothing you can do.

212
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,969
She's going to jail this time.

213
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:21,430
-l don't know about that.
-And why not?

214
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,391
Apparently, Your Honor,
our officers forgot to Mirandize her.

215
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,602
l was waiting for Miranda to come in,
and nobody came in.

216
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,896
l was waiting for her.
That's right. Ain't nobody Miranda me.

217
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,148
Miranda wasn't even in the room.

218
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,691
Excuse me?

219
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,318
We were fighting for our lives, Your Honor.

220
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,320
You forgot to Mirandize her?

221
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,364
That old woman got the strength
of any man.

222
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,994
l've got to let you go.

223
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,454
You gotta let me go.

224
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,750
-As much as l hate it, l have to.
-Yes, you do.

225
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,586
But l'm going to suspend
your driver's license indefinitely.

226
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,381
Suspend my license?
My license been suspended.

227
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,091
Hell, you ain't doing nothing.

228
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,592
l ain't had a license in 38 years.

229
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,636
Say, what the hell she talking about
she's gonna suspend my...

230
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,472
What that gonna do? l got keys.

231
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,141
l'm going to order you
to anger management counseling.

232
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,310
She'll take it. Thank you, Your Honor.
We appreciate it.

233
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:12,481
Go see the clerk. Get the paperwork done
and get her out of my courtroom now.

234
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,649
-You're free to go.
-Free to go?

235
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,860
Look at my neck! Hold on.
Wait a minute. Did you see my eye?

236
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,362
Saw your eye. Saw that face, too.

237
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,739
You're tore the hell up. l'm free to go.

238
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,324
l don't know if you's going home,

239
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,451
but l'm going home. l'm going home.

240
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:27,704
Calm down, Officer. lt's your fault.
You forgot to Mirandize her.

241
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:28,789
This is ridiculous.

242
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,041
Take care, Judge! l love you.

243
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:32,292
But l got to go.

244
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,586
But the saving grace is

245
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:37,256
she couldn't stay out of trouble
if you paid her.

246
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,507
She'll be back.

247
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:42,511
Hey, Joshua.

248
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:44,513
Hey.

249
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:46,473
Hey, Ellen.

250
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:50,018
-Who's this?
-This is Mindy.

251
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,562
Mindy.

252
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,522
Wait in the car, baby.

253
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,903
She's only 14, Josh.

254
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:02,739
Pimp found her in the bus station
and put her out in the streets.

255
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:04,491
l'm glad you found her.

256
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:05,742
Thank God.

257
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:08,412
You know, Ellen, l gotta tell you,

258
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:13,000
l think the job that you're doing
with these girls, it's great.

259
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:15,794
lt's just me trying to do
the work of my Lord.

260
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,963
l know you make Him proud.

261
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,506
Thanks again.

262
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:22,468
Hey, Ellen.

263
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:24,219
l want you to meet somebody.

264
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,597
Candy, this is Ellen Holmes.

265
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:30,309
She's a minister and she helps
get girls off the street.

266
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,478
-Hi.
-Hey.

267
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:35,481
Here's my card if you need anything.

268
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,524
Do l look like l'm on the streets to you?

269
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,360
No, but you look like
you work in the streets.

270
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:43,322
You know what? l ain't got no time
for no Jesus jokers, all right?

271
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,533
Fine. Then l ain't got time for you, either,
sucker.

272
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:49,786
See you later, Joshua.

273
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,625
What kind of minister is that?

274
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,835
l know. l know. She's the real deal, though.

275
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,214
So you bail me out?

276
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:01,548
Yeah.

277
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:02,716
So where do you want to do this?

278
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,385
We can go to your car,
we can go to your house, l'm not sure...

279
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,012
Wait, wait, wait.
What are you talking about?

280
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,306
You bailed me out,
so you must want something, right?

281
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,308
So what, do you think
l want some sex from you?

282
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,143
What you want, then?

283
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:16,021
What about, you know, like,
"How you been? How you doing?"

284
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:18,440
Ain't no man asking a woman
how she doing

285
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:21,944
unless he wants something, so what is it?
What you want from me, Josh?

286
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,863
Okay. What are you doing out here
on these streets, Candy?

287
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:27,991
How about you don't worry about that?
l gotta go. l ain't got time for...

288
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,494
Candy, hold on. Hold on. Just...

289
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:31,828
All right.

290
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:34,706
Let me take you to get something to eat.
You hungry?

291
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:39,044
Come on. Just... Please?

292
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,341
-The Lord is so good.
-Yes, He is.

293
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,844
He is so good he delivered your mama
out of the belly of that jail.

294
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:49,012
-Yes, he did.
-Yes.

295
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,681
We going to church Sunday, huh, Madea?

296
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,976
l ain't going to no church.

297
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,353
Now, hold up. Wait a minute.

298
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,313
Let me put some churching in it.

299
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,440
You said that if the Lord got you
through this,

300
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:02,234
you was going by the church.
And you're going.

301
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:05,028
And that's just what l'm going to do.
l'm going by the church.

302
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:07,823
-So when you coming?
-We just did.

303
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,283
l said l would go by the church.

304
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,451
We just passed by one. Hallelujer.

305
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:14,830
St. Philip and them. Hail Mary, full of grace,
and all you people, God bless you.

306
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,707
All you little Catholic people, hello.

307
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,960
Mabel. The Lord is just so...

308
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:23,255
You just make the Lord mad.

309
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,340
Bow your head. Let's pray for her.

310
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:26,550
Cora, bow your head.

311
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,219
-Brian, bow your head.
-Mr. Brown, l'm driving.

312
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:30,721
-Yes.
-The Lord know.

313
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:32,556
He can watch the wheel. Bow your head.

314
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,724
Mabel, you bow your head.

315
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:36,143
Brown, if you don't shut the hell up and...

316
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:39,313
Mabel, bow your head! Put your head
in your lap and smother yourself.

317
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:40,564
Bow your head!

318
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,442
Lord, don't send Madea to hell.

319
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:46,987
Just give her a little house
right outside the gates of heaven

320
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,740
so she can watch all of us go in.

321
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:50,949
Amend.

322
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,452
-And amend.
-Amen.

323
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:57,164
But, Madea, you can't make
those type of promises and break them.

324
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:58,498
-Cora.
-Yes?

325
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:01,418
-Do me a favor.
-Yes, ma'am.

326
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,337
Put the "shut" to the "up," okay?

327
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:04,588
"Shut" to the "up."

328
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,006
-l say, what?
-Madea.

329
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,507
Cora, don't even worry.

330
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:10,302
Just let it go.
l'm telling you, when she get in trouble,

331
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,386
then she come running to the church.

332
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:12,512
No, no, no.

333
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:15,098
Madea ain't fitting to get in no more trouble.
l ain't fitting to have that.

334
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:16,850
That's enough.
Between you and my daddy, that's enough.

335
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,101
You ain't getting in
no more trouble, Madea.

336
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:19,978
l'm telling you. You got off easy this time.

337
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:21,605
Who in the hell are you talking to?
l'm grown.

338
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:22,939
l am grown, okay, Brian?

339
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:25,025
You don't tell me nothing. l'm grown.

340
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,862
l wasn't in trouble that time.
You don't tell me nothing.

341
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:33,283
Madea, l was reading this pamphlet
from the courts about anger management.

342
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:35,285
lt says as women get older,

343
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,829
our bodies
don't produce as many hormones

344
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:40,624
as it needs to stay calm
and have stable moods.

345
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,377
But you going to see this doctor
is going to be real good for you.

346
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,879
l'm not going to no anger manager, Cora.

347
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,631
What the hell you bring
them down here for, Brian?

348
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,300
Why you yelling at me?
They wanted to come.

349
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:52,719
l mean, what was l supposed to do?
Mr. Brown jumped in the car.

350
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:55,263
You was happy to see us
when you wanted some of our prayer.

351
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:56,348
That's right.

352
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,725
l'm telling you,
you need to go see one of them doctors.

353
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:02,062
They gave me one of them...
What they said, Brian...

354
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,897
Coca-cola-osomy.

355
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,944
You had a colonoscopy, Mr. Brown?

356
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,153
Same thing.

357
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,905
l thought that fool said Coca-Cola.

358
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,157
He was making me thirsty
for a good ol' Coke.

359
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:17,327
Now, Mabel, when we get old,
we gotta keep ourself checked.

360
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:19,413
Now, you know they checked my prostate?

361
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:21,915
Mabel, you need to get
your prostate checked, too.

362
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,917
Women don't have a prostate, Mr. Brown.

363
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:26,795
Cora, l'm telling you. Madea got a prostate.

364
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:40,684
You know, there's more
where that came from.

365
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,609
Why you bail me out ofjail?

366
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:50,902
'Cause you're a friend.

367
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,365
l don't understand why you...

368
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,993
Why you have to do this.

369
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,620
You a smart girl.
You used to get straight A's.

370
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,289
You remember?

371
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,124
-Wow.
-What?

372
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:05,751
You really have tricked yourself

373
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,378
into believing that that night
ain't ever happened.

374
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,797
Well, Josh, it did happen.

375
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:13,717
And it changed my life forever.

376
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:20,557
l tried to look for you every day after that.

377
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,562
You must have been looking
in some pretty high places, Josh.

378
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,648
Candy, l don't understand
why you're out there on those streets.

379
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:32,569
Look. You deal with things your way,
and l deal with them mine.

380
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,488
l don't need you to be
judging me right now.

381
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:36,198
-l'm not judging you.
-Yes, you are!

382
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:39,242
What you think you doing sitting in here,
talking to me crazy!

383
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:40,952
-Will you... Please?
-Don't you shush me!

384
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:42,913
Tell me to be...
Oh, am l embarrassing you now?

385
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:45,248
So you all got something to say, too?
What you got? What?

386
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,333
Anybody else?

387
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,043
Please. l'm not your enemy.

388
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:52,047
Hey. What's up, Josh?

389
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,883
Chuck, this is an old friend of mine.

390
00:18:56,928 --> 00:18:59,012
Okay. How you doing? l'm Chuck.

391
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,475
Okay.

392
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:06,520
Hey, Baby.

393
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:07,896
-Hey.
-Hey.

394
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:09,439
Thought you were in court.

395
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:12,442
l was. lt got kicked. She wasn't Mirandized.

396
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:14,486
What's this?

397
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,322
She's a friend of mine.

398
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:19,115
What's her name?

399
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,538
l tried your friend. You made bail quickly.

400
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,959
Candy, this is my fiancée, Linda.

401
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:31,461
Wait, hold on. You said that's your fiancée?

402
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:33,547
You marrying her?

403
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,050
That'll never work.

404
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:44,850
l gotta go.

405
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:48,186
Hey, Candy.

406
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:50,564
Look, this is my number.

407
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,401
lf you need anything,
just give me a call, all right?

408
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,570
Yeah.

409
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,840
Are you going to handle it?

410
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,174
Yeah.

411
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:22,345
Honey,
you are an assistant district attorney.

412
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:25,390
You shouldn't be hanging out
with the likes of those people.

413
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,766
What are you doing with her?

414
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:28,435
Don't answer that.

415
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:34,065
She's an old friend,
and l was just trying to help her out.

416
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,442
Bad move.

417
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,820
-What did l say, Linda?
-You did.

418
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,780
-Didn't l? Didn't l say it?
-Yeah, you did.

419
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:42,073
What did you say?

420
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:46,953
l was talking to your future wife here,
remember that?

421
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:49,414
About the fact that you feel guilty, Josh.

422
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,583
l know. l made it out of the ghetto, too.

423
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,501
But l don't apologize for it.

424
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:56,838
But these people,
they will never let you forget.

425
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:58,298
And as long as you let them do that,

426
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,759
you will always feel
a sense of obligation to them.

427
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:03,303
-Now, am l right, or am l right?
-That is not it.

428
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:04,971
Don't talk. Just agree.

429
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:08,558
Well, whatever it is, the point is

430
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:11,353
they were afforded the same opportunities
you were.

431
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,480
You did something, they didn't.

432
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,815
Linda, it's not always that simple.

433
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,736
Just agree to disagree
and change the subject.

434
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,238
Okay, can we just order some food, maybe?

435
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:23,323
Yes.

436
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:28,036
-We're back at the house.
-My daddy is having a party here.

437
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,747
l gotta go pick up my kids.
You all gotta handle this.

438
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,833
l know Joe ain't having no party
at my damn house!

439
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:36,294
How could you...

440
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:38,588
l know Joe ain't having
no party at my damn house!

441
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:41,549
Yes, he is, Madea. He up and...

442
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,426
Wait. Just stay calm.

443
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:47,055
-Cora! Who these people, Cora?
-l don't know.

444
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,640
Cora, who are these people
up in my house?

445
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:49,724
l don't know.

446
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,122
Holy smoke.

447
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:14,374
-Look at all these people.
-The music's too loud.

448
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,127
Uncle Joe having a party.
l know Madea will be upset.

449
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:22,549
Madea's upset.

450
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,217
Hey, sexy.

451
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:28,513
You look like a bowl of peach ice cream.
l could...

452
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:33,560
Get out of my face before
l throw this oil all over you!

453
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:36,438
Oh, now you want to get kinky, huh?

454
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:37,689
Kinky? You...

455
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,649
l like that.

456
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:45,739
-The devil is a lie.
-He is.

457
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,632
Hey, sexy.

458
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,926
You want to spend some time with me

459
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,928
and be my client?

460
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,597
What kind of work she do, Cora?

461
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:13,767
A lawyer in the sickroom?
A doctor in the courtroom?

462
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:15,643
She's a...

463
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,812
Say it, baby!

464
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,189
l'm a prostitute.

465
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,690
A prosti-what?

466
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:22,942
"A prostitute" is what she said.

467
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:24,569
Streetwalker.

468
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:25,820
Woman of the night.

469
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:28,448
Cora, give me that oil.

470
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:31,618
The devil is a lie. The blood! The blood!

471
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:35,246
She a Mary Magdalene, Cora.

472
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:44,756
-Madea, just stay calm, okay?
-Mabel, don't have no nervous breakdown.

473
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,424
Stay calm, Madea. Just stay calm.

474
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,554
-Mabel, just...
-Where the hell is Joe?

He know l just got out ofjail.

476
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:57,811
Hey, Mabel. Hell, l didn't even know
you was coming home.

00:23:57,895 --> 00:23:59,562
How you doing? Good to see you.

478
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:01,815
Joe, who the hell are all these people
in my house?

479
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:05,819
When l saw the news,

00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:39,370
-Hi, Donna.
-Hi, Ellen.

510
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:41,664
This is my friend Candace.

511
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:45,543
Here you go again.

512
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:46,669
We've met.

513
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:48,963
This is my girl right here.
We were in New York together.

514
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:52,508
l begged her to come down here.
And she finally came.

515
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:53,593
ls that right?

516
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:55,094
Taking care of yourself out here?

517
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:56,721
Why you all in my business?

518
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,432
Candy. Ellen is good people.

519
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,392
l'm just here to help.

520
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:04,646
By thumping your Bible at me every
five minutes the way my grandmamma did?

521
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,855
Child, l don't even know your grandmamma,

522
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,858
and l don't carry no Bible around with me.
lt's at home on my mantel.

523
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:11,152
You ain't got to carry it
'cause you know every word in it.

524
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,779
You better know it.

525
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:14,030
Amen.

526
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,451
So, you gonna give me
some of them or not?

527
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:21,412
You asking me?

528
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:23,748
Go on, act right, man. She's good people.

529
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:26,084
May l have some, please?

530
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:28,795
"May l."

531
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,340
Look at you sounding all educated.

532
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:34,759
Here.

533
00:26:37,972 --> 00:26:40,056
Here's a voucher
for some food if you need it.

534
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,061
What?

535
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,896
You don't know how to say thank you.

536
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,816
Thank you.

537
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:52,026
-You on drugs?
-Why?

538
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,569
What is it, heroin or coke?

539
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:56,781
Lady, don't you be touching me.
You don't know me. You need to back up.

540
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:59,784
-Need some clean needles?
-l do. What's wrong with you?

541
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,286
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

542
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:04,080
-Thank you.
-Ladies, take care of yourselves.

543
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,416
And, Donna, l'm still waiting.

544
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:08,167
l know.

545
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,047
Donna, who is that fool?

546
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:18,177
Man, l've been on these streets
since l was 1 6 years old.

547
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:21,806
l've seen all kinds of people say they come
in the name of one god or another.

548
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:25,852
But that woman right there, she's real.

549
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:28,896
She's good folks, man.

550
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:32,942
She be around all types of dope boy,
pimps, addicts.

551
00:27:33,027 --> 00:27:35,236
She treats us all the same.

552
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:37,030
She preaches down at the prison.

553
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:40,908
Why she say she waiting on you?

554
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,246
l keep telling her
l'm gonna get off these streets.

555
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:54,005
No, sir. l... That's all l have.

556
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,508
The first, the last name.

557
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:01,637
That's all l have. Sure. No, l understand.

558
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:06,476
All right. Okay. Okay. Thank you.

559
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:11,230
-Any luck?
-Nope.

560
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,694
What about you?

561
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:18,071
Nope.

562
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:22,158
You know, tell me again.
Why are we doing this?

563
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:25,286
l'm just trying to find somebody
to help her get off these streets.

564
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:29,165
You never done this before, so it's...

565
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:30,792
We got history.

566
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:33,836
-Oh, you...
-No!

567
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,046
Not like that.

568
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,714
Here you are,
you trying to help this girl, man,

569
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:40,343
and l've never heard you mention her.
Okay, l've known you for what, three years?

570
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,261
And you know what? On top of all that,

571
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:45,056
we're supposed to be looking for
vacation spots for your honeymoon, man.

572
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,557
-We are.
-No, no, no. No.

573
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:49,102
"We." You call me up, you say,
"Man, come..."

574
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:50,186
Hey.

575
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,687
-Hey, baby.
-Hey, how you doing?

576
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:53,398
-Good. How are you?
-l am good.

577
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:56,442
Okay. You know what?
l'm gonna leave you lovebirds alone.

578
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:58,194
-Where you running off to?
-l gotta...

579
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:01,114
-To do... Yeah. Yeah.
-You ain't going nowhere.

580
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:03,032
l got a date, so...

581
00:29:03,117 --> 00:29:04,951
-What's your date's name?
-Lucky girl.

582
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,578
Leave me alone. l'm out.

583
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:09,914
So today was incredible.

584
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:13,042
l found these shoes.
The girls are gonna flip out.

585
00:29:13,127 --> 00:29:15,545
And l also found the most
amazing new dressmaker,

586
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:17,171
and she agreed to do the dress for us.

587
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,173
-That's great.
-l know.

588
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:22,093
Did you find any places
for the honeymoon?

589
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:26,389
No, actually, l was...

590
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:31,144
l was looking for
some of Candy's family in Texas.

591
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,149
Okay, so you're still
talking about this prostitute?

592
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:39,360
-Babe, why are you calling her a prostitute?
-That's what she is.

593
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:41,237
Babe, where l'm from

594
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:43,656
if somebody needs help,
you try to help them out.

595
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:48,661
Okay, sweetie, you know that you can only
help someone that wants to be helped.

596
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,163
Those people don't want help.

597
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,165
Honey, why are you calling them
"those people"?

598
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:56,210
l mean, those people,
people like her, from that side of the tracks.

599
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,546
l'm from the same street.

600
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,006
We were in college together until this...

601
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:03,509
Sweetie, that doesn't make any difference.
lt's not the same thing with you.

602
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,136
Sweetie, she's not like you.

603
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,973
lt is her own fault
if she didn't make something of herself.

604
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:12,393
Linda, you've always had things
handed to you.

605
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,897
-You've always been Daddy's little princess.
-What?

606
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:18,649
Until you've been on the streets,
you really wouldn't understand.

607
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:19,942
That is my cue to leave.

608
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:22,778
-What you mean...
-So l'm gonna let you cool off for a minute.

609
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:24,280
-What are you... Linda.
-Yes?

610
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,324
l'm sorry. l am.

611
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:29,410
But it bothered me seeing
that woman on the street.

612
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:31,579
-lt bothers you?
-Yes, it bothers me.

613
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:34,540
Okay. When she stops
bothering you so much,

614
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:35,958
why don't you give me a call?

615
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:37,460
-Linda. Linda.
-Okay?

616
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,129
Hey, l don't want you to go.

617
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:42,381
l don't want to hear about this girl anymore.

618
00:30:42,633 --> 00:30:44,008
-l'm done with her.
-Okay.

619
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,718
Now, you've helped her enough.

620
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,845
You won't hear about it again.

621
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:57,438
You still out here?

622
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:01,984
Yeah, girl. lt's a slow night.

623
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:04,487
No, it's not. Those Army boys just got paid.

624
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:08,074
You turned down, like, three
when l was here before.

625
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:10,159
What's up, girl?

626
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:14,914
l ran into somebody
who l knew from before earlier today.

627
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:16,415
l see.

628
00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:19,293
You started thinking about
what your life could have been.

629
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:20,628
No, not me.

630
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:24,006
l know l ain't got no time
to be chasing no dreams.

631
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:26,842
You ain't like the rest of us, Candy.

632
00:31:27,261 --> 00:31:30,346
You can get out of here
and make something of yourself.

633
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:32,682
What?
Me, some Betty Crocker mom or something?

634
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:34,308
No, you smart.

635
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,229
l see how you be reading them books.

636
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:41,774
Listen. Terry McMillan ain't doing nothing
to get me no fix, okay?

637
00:31:43,277 --> 00:31:46,779
All l'm saying is
if anybody can get out of here, you can.

638
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:49,156
l've seen you talk to a million people.

639
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,951
l've seen you talk your way
out of all kinds of stuff.

640
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,953
You can do it.

641
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,414
Whatever, Donna. Please.

642
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:58,791
All right, l'm gonna make a deal with you.

643
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,628
lf l get off these streets,
you gotta get off these streets.

644
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,592
All right. That's a bet.

645
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:10,344
Maybe we can help each other.

646
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:14,056
Now, you know we always do, girl.
You know what l was just thinking about?

647
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:15,391
Remember when we were
in New York, right...

648
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:16,475
Donna!

649
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,436
Candy, come on. Run! Run!

650
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:34,493
-Oh, my God.
-Think you can hide from me?

651
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:35,578
-No.
-l told you

652
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,204
not to be out here solo, Donna Lynn,
you hear me?

653
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:39,040
Okay, Daddy, please.

654
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:41,626
-Okay.
-Now get your ass out of here!

655
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,919
Okay. Candy, let's go.

656
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:46,172
-No, no, no. Not you.
-What you want with her?

657
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:48,257
You want a real woman.
You don't want her.

658
00:32:48,342 --> 00:32:50,134
l see what l want!
Now get your ass out of here!

659
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,385
She's just been here a couple of weeks!

660
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:54,305
l'm trying to show her the ropes.
She ain't ready! She ain't ready!

661
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,064
Where do you think you're going, huh?

662
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:04,857
Where the hell
do you think you're going, girl?

663
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:08,152
You're not going nowhere.
You understand me?

664
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:09,862
Nothing goes down...

665
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:56,784
Where do you think you're going?

666
00:33:56,868 --> 00:34:00,955
Please. Please. Please.
l won't tell anybody. l promise.

667
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,915
What? You think that scares me?

668
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:07,712
Please. Please, let me go. Please, let me go.

669
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:09,880
What are you gonna do for me
if l let you go?

670
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:12,508
What do you want me to do?

671
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:14,385
You belong to me.

672
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:15,761
You're my slave.

673
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:20,391
lf a slave want to be free,
they got to buy their freedom.

674
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:22,852
Okay. Okay.

675
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:26,772
l want you to get in that bathroom,
and l want you to get cleaned up.

676
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,024
l can get a premium for you.

677
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:30,776
All right, go on, baby.

678
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:34,780
Go on, it's all right.

679
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,621
You're gonna learn you ain't gonna be
protected on these streets

680
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:45,207
unless you got a pimp. You understand?

681
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:48,544
l've got this nice party
l'm going to take you to.

682
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:52,715
A lot of new potential clients.
A couple of Gs, easy.

683
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,301
l want you to make yourself
look real nice, girl.

684
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:57,386
l got a good feeling about you.

685
00:34:57,471 --> 00:34:59,680
You'll become my special girl.

686
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:02,224
Don't be wasting time in there, girl.

687
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:05,144
Come on now. We got to get there
in an hour. l don't want to be late.

688
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:11,400
l don't hear that shower in there, Candy.

689
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,070
What's going on in there?

690
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:17,156
Candy? Candy?

691
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,238
Okay. Okay.

692
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:04,620
Operator, l need District Attorney
Josh Hardaway.

693
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:07,540
Just connect me to his phone, please!
lt's an emergency!

694
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:22,513
Hello.

695
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:26,141
Hey.

696
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,435
You okay?

697
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,565
Are you serious? Where are you?

698
00:36:33,984 --> 00:36:36,235
Okay, l'm coming right now.

699
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:39,572
l'm coming... l'm coming right now.

700
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:42,950
All right. l know. All right. Bye.

701
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:24,783
Candy? Can you walk?

702
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:27,453
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

703
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,455
Okay. Okay.

704
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,013
lt's okay.

705
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,405
Baby?

706
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:48,450
l fell asleep.
How come you're not in bed, sweetie?

707
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:50,202
What? What's the matter?

708
00:38:51,413 --> 00:38:52,454
l can explain. l can explain.

709
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:55,332
ls that my robe? You can explain?

710
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:56,834
She's in trouble.
l'm just trying to help her out.

711
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,419
Why did you bring her here?

712
00:38:58,503 --> 00:38:59,962
Linda, she needs somebody.

713
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,880
l don't care what she needs!

714
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:04,258
Shush? Are you kidding me?

715
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:07,553
What is it with you and this girl?
What is going on here?

716
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:11,223
Linda, l told you,
l'm the only one that can help her out.

717
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:12,474
No, Josh. You know what?

718
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:15,102
You have some decisions to make
and some thinking to do.

719
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,645
l am leaving!

720
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:20,024
And stop shushing me!
Shushing me so the prostitute can sleep?

721
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:22,609
l am done, Josh. l cannot believe this.

722
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:25,154
Linda, just don't slam the door.

723
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:27,156
You slammed it.

724
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,199
Do you know how much a door costs?

725
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:32,036
You always did know how to pick them.

726
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,912
She's not your type.

727
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:40,294
How do you know what my type is?
You haven't seen me in five years.

728
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:44,506
Josh, l know you. Okay? And she is not it.

729
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:48,177
She's entirely too much of a princess.

730
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:50,512
lt ain't gonna work.

731
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:53,766
l bet you ain't even proposed to her.

732
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:58,729
Then why do you think
we're getting married then, smarty?

733
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,731
Because she told you you were.

734
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,274
You don't know me.

735
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:04,651
You think you know me,
but you don't know me, girl.

736
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:07,154
Josh, l know you. We grew up...

737
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:11,075
We spent every day together
when we were kids.

738
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,910
l know you.

739
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:14,828
Candace, people change.

740
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:17,790
l know that's right.

741
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:21,960
You're shaking. You cold?

742
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,299
This ain't the cold shakes, baby.

743
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:29,968
When did you start using?
When you got out of school?

744
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:33,680
Had to find some way to cope, just like you.

745
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:36,475
What are you talking about? Me?

746
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,601
Ambition.

747
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,562
Working two jobs

748
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:43,607
while you were in school full-time.

749
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,610
You did that so you
don't have to think about what happened.

750
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:49,822
That's a interesting concept you got.

751
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:52,991
Josh, l don't want to talk about this, okay?

752
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,411
All right. We don't have to...
We don't have to talk.

753
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:01,667
Hey, Josh.

754
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,252
Yeah?

755
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:08,590
You remember that bed-and-breakfast
that we were gonna open in Savannah?

756
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:10,759
Down by the river.

757
00:41:10,844 --> 00:41:13,095
Bells. l remember Bells.

758
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:15,389
-You remember?
-Yeah, l remember.

759
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,100
Oh, Josh.

760
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:21,103
l was gonna buy it

761
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:24,148
and live happily ever after.

762
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:26,859
So why didn't you buy it?

763
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:30,154
l couldn't find a job, and...

764
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:34,867
l ain't have no money.

765
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:36,535
l was so hungry.

766
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:42,708
And then l met this man,

767
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:46,336
and he said he loved me.

768
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:50,674
He said he was gonna take care of me.

769
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:55,137
And he said that if l loved him, then l would

770
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:57,347
sleep with him and his friend.

771
00:41:57,432 --> 00:42:01,185
And it turned into his other friends,
without him.

772
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,188
And then strangers.

773
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:07,983
lt took me four years,

774
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,943
four years

775
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:12,154
to get away from him.

776
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:14,781
CeCe, l'm sorry. l...

777
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,241
CeCe?

778
00:42:16,826 --> 00:42:18,035
Yeah.

779
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:21,413
That little girl, she died a long time ago.

780
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:28,962
Boy, are those tears in your eyes?

781
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:33,091
You better man up.
Don't you sit over there feeling sorry for me.

782
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,886
At least l get paid for what l do now.

783
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:38,555
You do not get paid for what you do.

784
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,519
l told all y'all
l ain't got no anger manager problem.

785
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:46,521
Y'all still insisting on me going.

786
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:48,232
Madea, you have
a anger management problem.

787
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:49,942
Fine, Cora. Take me down there, then.

788
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:52,236
l don't understand why...
That's why l'm gonna get you one of these.

789
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,487
One of what?

790
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,948
-This, right here. One of these.
-What is that?

791
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:58,617
lt's a reminder on how to treat people.

792
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:02,371
WWJD. l'm gonna get you one.
You know what that mean?

793
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:05,874
What that stand for?
"What's Wrong with Jermaine Dupri"?

794
00:43:05,959 --> 00:43:08,627
No. lt means "What Would Jesus Do?"
Everybody know that, Madea, come on.

795
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:09,753
-Come on.
-l don't know that.

796
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:12,464
Did you see that?

797
00:43:14,384 --> 00:43:15,842
-Did you see him?
-Yes, l saw it.

798
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,219
Cora, what you gonna do?

799
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:19,221
l'm gonna WWJD.

800
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:22,057
Cora, Jesus did not have no car.
You better go get that fool.

801
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:24,017
Madea, he gonna get his. No, l can't.

802
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:25,227
-Cora, Cora.
-He gonna get his.

803
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,271
Look at him, rushing.
He got stopped by the light.

804
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,314
Pull up on him, then. Roll up on him.

805
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:31,024
-Okay.
-l'm gonna do a drive-by.

806
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:35,904
No, you not.
You just calm down. l got this. l got this.

807
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:37,572
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.

808
00:43:37,657 --> 00:43:39,241
-Hey, fool!
-What?

809
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:41,785
You just cut in front of me.
Did you see that?

810
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,495
Go to hell.

811
00:43:44,414 --> 00:43:46,164
What... Did... What?

812
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:49,501
-Did you hear that?
-Did you show him your bracelet, Cora?

813
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:52,963
-Did you show him the WWJD?
-Don't be funny, Madea. That is not...

814
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,048
Cora, l didn't raise no punk.
You better go get that fool.

815
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:56,800
l'm not no punk, Madea, but he...

816
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:59,386
-Cora, you ain't gonna be no punk!
-l'm not no punk, Madea!

817
00:44:05,852 --> 00:44:09,146
We punked that dude in his face!
We got that fool!

818
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:28,081
Mama?

819
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,752
Girl, l ain't your mama.

820
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:37,799
Good morning.

821
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:40,635
What are you, a size five, six?

822
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,928
Why?

823
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:44,389
Probably a three.
You don't look like you eat much.

824
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:48,435
Josh, what... What the hell is this?

825
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:50,937
We both set up a job interview for you.

826
00:44:51,064 --> 00:44:53,398
l think l can cover that eye up.

827
00:44:53,483 --> 00:44:55,609
We have companies
that work with our ministries

828
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:58,820
to get women off the street.
That's if you want to be.

829
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:00,489
Who said l wanted to be, huh?

830
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:03,116
-Candy, you said that's what you wanted.
-Well, l told you.

831
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:06,495
l mean, sometimes women like her
say one thing one day,

832
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:08,997
and then they wake up and they say...

833
00:45:09,082 --> 00:45:12,250
Okay, what you mean, "girls like her"?
You don't even know me!

834
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:13,919
Chicks, junkies like you with a problem

835
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:16,254
say one thing one day
and another the other,

836
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:17,923
because you're on that stuff.

837
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:19,383
Go to hell.

838
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:21,093
You go first.

839
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:23,512
l ain't no damn addict.

840
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:27,766
Candy? Candy?

841
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:31,978
lf the public defender can show the judge
that you got a job,

842
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:33,563
that's gonna look really, really good.

843
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:35,774
And they may even suspend your sentence.

844
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:36,942
l need to know...

845
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:40,404
l need you to try this, please.

846
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:43,490
Fine! Fine!

847
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:44,658
Fine.

848
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:51,373
-Thank you.
-Okay, we'll see you there.

849
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:52,707
l gotta go to work.

850
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:55,168
Candy, after you're done,
can you come down to the courthouse?

851
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:59,381
l want to talk to your lawyer.
l want to see if l can help him through this.

852
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:00,966
Okay?

853
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:04,261
Yeah. Okay. Sure.

854
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:15,897
You want to try to get this job or not?

855
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:21,653
l told them that l didn't need to come here
and see you, okay?

856
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:24,739
You know, l don't usually
see people individually,

857
00:46:24,824 --> 00:46:28,702
but when l saw this tape
of you getting arrested,

858
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:31,329
l thought, "l have got
to talk to this woman."

859
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:35,709
What is wrong with you?
Why are you... Why are you so angry?

860
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,335
First of all, ain't nothing wrong with me.

861
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:40,422
Secondly, l'm not angry.
Okay? l'm not angry.

862
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:41,631
You seem angry right now.

863
00:46:41,716 --> 00:46:44,926
No, l'm not angry. This is how l am.
l don't have no hostility at all.

864
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:48,388
Do you have to be in control
all the time of everything?

865
00:46:48,473 --> 00:46:51,057
l don't have to be in control all the time.
l ain't got no problem with that.

866
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:52,976
Then why do you get so angry?

867
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:55,729
l don't get angry.

868
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:58,356
l keep trying to tell you and that judge
that l do not get angry.

869
00:46:58,441 --> 00:46:59,733
lf somebody do something to me,

870
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:02,110
l do something to them.
That's just common sense.

871
00:47:02,195 --> 00:47:03,653
So you believe in getting even?

872
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:05,572
Hell to the yeah.

873
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:08,283
Why do you feel the need that you gotta
get somebody all the time?

874
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:10,577
lt's like, "Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em."
You don't think that's angry?

875
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:11,870
lf they got me, got me, got me,

876
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:14,414
l gotta get them, get them, get them.
Yeah, that's what it is.

877
00:47:14,499 --> 00:47:16,333
What you call getting got

878
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:18,835
is a whole lot different
than what other people call getting got.

879
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,421
lt doesn't take much to "get you," does it?

880
00:47:21,506 --> 00:47:24,299
When you're "getting got" and somebody
done got you and you go get them.

881
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:25,634
When you get 'em,
everybody's gonna get got.

882
00:47:25,718 --> 00:47:27,969
Yeah, but if you're getting somebody
that you say got you

883
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:30,805
when they didn't get you to begin with,
then you're getting the gotters

884
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:31,973
when they didn't do anything to you
to get you.

885
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:34,809
Yeah, but if the gotters get me,
l'm going to get my Glock.

886
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:38,980
Yeah, well, but you don't get the Glock
when you haven't been got.

887
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:41,316
So what l'm trying to explain to you
is l don't care who done got me,

888
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,527
l'm gonna get them first.
You get me? l'm gonna get you.

889
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:44,903
Why is it so important?

890
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:47,864
Okay. l'm tired of you
asking me all these questions

891
00:47:47,949 --> 00:47:49,282
'cause l didn't sign up for this.

892
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:51,326
lt's the judge that
told me to come here, okay?

893
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:54,621
Everybody wants to get even.
Everybody want to get even.

894
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:58,333
All right. All right.
Let's just talk about your childhood.

895
00:47:58,417 --> 00:47:59,960
Okay? Let's talk about your childhood.

896
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:05,924
Let's talk about your childhood.

897
00:48:09,262 --> 00:48:13,056
Talking about my childhood
isn't gonna help us.

898
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,307
So what was your childhood like?

899
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:16,560
-What was yours like?
-Do you... Why...

900
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:20,855
Let's talk about your anger.
That's why you're here, right?

901
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,482
l'm not angry. l don't know why l'm here.

902
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:25,485
-Let's just try another approach, okay?
-Let's try another approach.

903
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:28,530
All right. Do you sleep well at night?

904
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:30,115
Do you sleep well at night?

905
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:32,951
Let's try not to answer a question
with a question.

906
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:35,328
Could we do that?
Could we at least do that?

907
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:37,622
Yes, if we at least
stop asking me all these questions,

908
00:48:37,707 --> 00:48:39,624
l wouldn't have to answer a question
with a question, now will l?

909
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:41,585
Can you stop? Can you just stop?

910
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:43,545
Can you just stop? Can you just stop?

911
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:47,257
-Okay.
-Are you getting angry, Doctor?

912
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:48,341
This isn't getting anywhere.

913
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:49,426
This is not getting anywhere.

914
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:53,388
No. l think l am gonna talk to the judge,
but l don't think this is getting anywhere.

915
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:55,098
-l think we're done.
-Thank you so much. l appreciate it.

916
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:56,600
-Okay, that's good.
-Wonderful to see you.

917
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:58,685
-Yes. Right.
-Great.

918
00:49:00,313 --> 00:49:02,355
Come on, Cora.
Let's get the hell out of here.

919
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,274
Wait a minute.

920
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:05,358
Well?

921
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:08,653
This lady is out of control.
She is... l can't help her.

922
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:12,324
Wait a minute now. Wait a minute now.
Now, you're the best.

923
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:15,702
Go see somebody else. l'm done.

924
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,245
Come on, Cora! Hell!

925
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:19,664
Now, what am l gonna do?

926
00:49:19,749 --> 00:49:22,042
l don't know who's going
to be able to help me. Ain't nobody...

927
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:27,589
Linda.

928
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:30,050
-Hey.
-Hey.

929
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:31,926
l've been trying to call you.

930
00:49:32,011 --> 00:49:34,429
You know what?
l got really busy with some stuff.

931
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:36,848
Avoiding me, right?

932
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:39,392
-No.
-l can explain.

933
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:41,895
Look, this isn't making any sense to me.

934
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:44,147
Okay? l mean, this girl,
she popped up out of nowhere.

935
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:46,858
Look, what if l had a pimp
who was a friend of mine

936
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:49,277
and he's in town for a month or so

937
00:49:49,362 --> 00:49:52,697
and he needs a place to sleep
so he's on my couch in your bathrobe?

938
00:49:52,782 --> 00:49:54,407
How do you feel about that? ls that okay?

939
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:56,868
l mean, seriously.
What would you have me think?

940
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,620
l know it sounds bad...

941
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:00,872
Yeah. We have built cases for death
on less than this.

942
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:02,374
So what do you want me to do?

943
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:05,293
l just want you to let this go.

944
00:50:05,378 --> 00:50:08,630
Really, l just want you to let her go back
to wherever it is she came from.

945
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:11,257
Josh, this is not our responsibility.

946
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:13,802
Look, l gotta go.

947
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:15,136
-Okay.
-Can we finish this later?

948
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:16,680
-All right. Thank you.
-All right. l'll call you.

949
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:18,640
Josh. Josh, Josh.

950
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:20,934
-What's up, man?
-Hey, what's going on, man?

951
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:23,311
-Nothing. You...
-l don't want to talk about it.

952
00:50:23,396 --> 00:50:25,313
-Okay. We don't have to talk about it.
-Please.

953
00:50:25,398 --> 00:50:27,774
l may have found a possible lead
for a brother of hers.

954
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:30,318
-Really?
-Yeah.

955
00:50:30,403 --> 00:50:32,404
-Thank you, man.
-lt's all good, bro.

956
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:33,988
-Yeah.
-lt's what l do.

957
00:50:34,073 --> 00:50:36,491
You know, it's funny, man.
They really don't get along.

958
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:56,344
lt says here that you went to college.

959
00:50:56,429 --> 00:50:58,346
Yeah, l did two years.

960
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:02,434
-What happened?
-l ain't finish.

961
00:51:02,518 --> 00:51:05,228
l see that.

962
00:51:08,441 --> 00:51:11,526
There are some blanks here
that you didn't fill out.

963
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,945
l didn't know the answer.
What you want me to do?

964
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:19,200
Looking at this application
tells me that you don't finish anything.

965
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:20,952
So why should we hire you?

966
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:23,037
Listen, man, l just need a job.

967
00:51:23,122 --> 00:51:25,623
You gonna give me one or not?
lt's real simple.

968
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,841
How bad do you want it?

969
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:57,071
l won't ask you to do anything
you haven't done a million times.

970
00:51:57,156 --> 00:51:59,032
l've seen your record.

971
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:09,042
Oh, God. No.

972
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:13,421
-What happened?
-Your Christian help ain't so Christian.

973
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:22,806
This is what your A-word get.
You're supposed to help these girls.

974
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:25,767
-You know how you set her back?
-Oh, God.

975
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:27,227
Dear Jesus.

976
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:35,819
Now l don't know where the hell Cora is at.
l done told her l need to go to the store.

977
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:37,946
And people done already told me
l can't be driving,

978
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:39,781
and she know that l need to go to the store.

979
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:41,866
That child gonna leave you
to starve to death.

980
00:52:41,951 --> 00:52:44,285
l told you when you were little
that the way you were treating her,

981
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:47,038
she's gonna leave you
to starve to death one day.

982
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:49,332
-And now's that time.
-Shut up, bastard.

983
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:52,460
Oh, Lord. Hello?

984
00:52:52,545 --> 00:52:55,088
-Cora.
-Hello, Madea. Yes?

985
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:56,798
-Corard!
-Yes, ma'am?

986
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:59,133
Where the hell you at?

987
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:01,010
l'm still at the hair salon.

988
00:53:01,095 --> 00:53:04,055
What the hell you doing at the hairdresser?
You been there five hours!

989
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:06,975
Your hair ain't but an inch and a half long!
What the hell they doing to you?

990
00:53:07,059 --> 00:53:10,311
l'm coming. l'm just trying to...
Can l have some "me" time, please?

991
00:53:13,649 --> 00:53:15,108
Hello? Hello?

992
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:19,153
-You need some what?
-Some "me" time.

993
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:22,073
Some what?

994
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:24,701
Some "me" time. Some time for myself.

995
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:26,786
-Cora?
-Yes, ma'am?

996
00:53:26,871 --> 00:53:29,122
Did l ever ask you
for some "me" time, Cora?

997
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:31,583
-No, ma'am.
-Did l ask you for some "me" time

998
00:53:31,667 --> 00:53:33,877
when l had to get up every four hours

999
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:36,671
and cook for you
up until the time you was 1 7 years old?

1000
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:39,048
-No, ma'am, you...
-Did l ask you for some "me" time

1001
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:41,593
when l had to hit that stripper pole
every night

1002
00:53:41,677 --> 00:53:43,636
trying to bring some money
into this house?

1003
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:45,305
Did l ask you for some "me" time then?

1004
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:46,973
-No, ma'am, no.
-All them old men...

1005
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,141
l'm up there trying to make it drizzle

1006
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:49,851
'cause they sure in the hell
couldn't make it rain!

1007
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:52,645
-What the hell is "me" time?
-l'm just taking care of myself.

1008
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,147
That's what l'm doing.
Getting some "me" time.

1009
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:55,648
Time for nothing! l'm going to the store.

1010
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:57,775
Hell, l don't need you to...
l'm a grown-ass woman!

1011
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:00,194
-l'm gonna go to the store myself.
-You can't go to the store.

1012
00:54:00,279 --> 00:54:02,697
You're not supposed to be driving.
l'll be there soon, okay?

1013
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:05,241
Who the hell you think you talking to,
telling me l can't drive?

1014
00:54:05,326 --> 00:54:06,910
lf l feel like driving, l'm driving!

1015
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:09,370
-You can't drive! You're gonna...
-Shut the hell up.

1016
00:54:09,455 --> 00:54:12,749
You get in that car, you going down, Mabel.
l'm not playing around.

1017
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:15,126
You going down. You understand?

1018
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:18,671
l'll be glad when you go down.

1019
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:21,174
Down to the graveyard
and become some maggot food.

1020
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:22,300
Hell, l'm grown. l'm home.

1021
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:24,135
What l'm supposed to do?
Just sit up in this house?

1022
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:26,262
You can miss a few meals.

1023
00:54:26,347 --> 00:54:27,430
One or two.

1024
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,557
Three or seven.

1025
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,393
Nine or eleven.

1026
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:35,480
Keep it up, Joe. Keep it up.

1027
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:39,067
Them people called! Them people called.
You ain't got to worry about no food.

1028
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:43,071
You can call them.
They said they'd bring it down here to ya.

1029
00:54:43,155 --> 00:54:45,573
What the hell you talking about, Joe?
Stop smoking that weed!

1030
00:54:45,658 --> 00:54:47,492
What the hell you talking about?
You're crazy as hell!

1031
00:54:47,576 --> 00:54:49,702
They said they'll give you three meals a day,

1032
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:54,207
and they'll give you a percentage
of the peoples who come through and pay.

1033
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,917
Well, where they feed you that much?

1034
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:59,837
One of the whales died.
They need another whale at the aquarium.

1035
00:54:59,922 --> 00:55:02,715
Go on down there and swim around for 'em.

1036
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:06,886
You rusty old bastard.
You fart, and dust come out.

1037
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:09,222
-Go to hell.
-Dead man walking!

1038
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:12,600
Walking the green mile.
Getting right with Jesus.

1039
00:55:12,685 --> 00:55:16,020
l'm gonna walk the green mile.
Get right with Jesus.

1040
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:27,907
l don't know what the hell you blowing at,
but keep blowing at me.

1041
00:55:27,992 --> 00:55:29,617
Come on, Grandma!

1042
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,125
You coming... You coming out?

1043
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:38,960
Hey! You coming out?

1044
00:55:39,545 --> 00:55:42,547
-Move it, lady!
-l guess you ain't coming out.

1045
00:55:48,554 --> 00:55:50,221
l like them shoes.

1046
00:55:52,224 --> 00:55:54,225
Come on, come on, come on!

1047
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,020
Here's a spot.

1048
00:55:57,104 --> 00:56:00,148
Now l got the groceries now,
l just need to get up in here.

1049
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:01,649
Come on out.

1050
00:56:12,745 --> 00:56:14,704

1051
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:17,248
l know damn well that you just...

1052
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,751
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1053
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:21,669
Lady, l know...

1054
00:56:21,754 --> 00:56:24,422
l know damn well you saw me
getting ready to take this spot.

1055
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:27,675
l saw you. l took it.

1056
00:56:27,968 --> 00:56:30,970
Why don't you move your little red car
before l move it for ya?

1057
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:34,974
Okay, go on in the store.

1058
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:37,560
Go on in the store. Just walk off.
Just walk off like you bad.

1059
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,187
You bad? You bad? Okay.

1060
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:43,316
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1061
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,402
l said l was waiting for that spot, lady.

1062
00:56:46,487 --> 00:56:48,821
Well, it's my spot now, Grandma.

1063
00:56:49,073 --> 00:56:50,156
Lady. Lady, look here.

1064
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,533
Lady! Lady, let me explain something...

1065
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:56,329
-Are you going to follow me into the store?
-Lady, let me explain something to you.

1066
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,539
Lord have mercy. Lord have mercy.

1067
00:56:58,624 --> 00:57:02,668
She gonna make me
tear the "K" and the "B" off of this Kmart.

1068
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:04,045
Let me back up.

1069
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:06,005
l ought to run right into her,
but Lord help me.

1070
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:07,757
l don't want to get in no trouble, Lord.

1071
00:57:08,342 --> 00:57:10,593
Help me, Jesus! Help me, Lord!

1072
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:14,055
You know, l'm ready
to go drive straight through this glass.

1073
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:16,849
That's all right. l'm gonna beat her ass.

1074
00:57:48,841 --> 00:57:50,633
Are you insane?

1075
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:52,844
Didn't l tell you? That was my parking spot.

1076
00:57:52,928 --> 00:57:56,389
And you gonna jump in front of me
and take my damn parking spot?

1077
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,850
Are you insane? Put my car down!

1078
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:00,768
Okay, l'm gonna put it down for ya.

1079
00:58:00,853 --> 00:58:04,021
Old woman, put my car down now!

1080
00:58:05,274 --> 00:58:06,357
Okay.

1081
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:24,458
My husband is a police officer,
and he is on his way right now!

1082
00:58:24,543 --> 00:58:28,379
l ain't scared of no po-po-po.
Call the po-po! Call the po-po!

1083
00:58:30,299 --> 00:58:34,719
Honey! This woman... This Jemima the Hun,

1084
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,138
she ruined my car!

1085
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:38,764
And l'm gonna get the hell out of here.

1086
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:42,977
lf he want me
he better come to my house to get me.

1087
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:44,312
He will!

1088
00:58:45,272 --> 00:58:48,357
Get over here now! The Kmart!

1089
00:58:51,737 --> 00:58:53,237
Am l forgiven?

1090
00:58:53,906 --> 00:58:56,157
Well, after those flowers
and those chocolates...

1091
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:59,202
-Yes.
-And that great movie that we just saw?

1092
00:58:59,745 --> 00:59:02,914
-You are definitely working on it.
-That's good.

1093
00:59:02,998 --> 00:59:04,749
Because l do not like it
when you're mad at me.

1094
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:07,335
Well, l don't like being mad at you.

1095
00:59:09,296 --> 00:59:11,672
-Oh, boy.
-Why don't we go inside and make up?

1096
00:59:11,757 --> 00:59:13,633
Let's go ahead.

1097
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:22,767
Can you just move a little faster, babe?

1098
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:30,066
Please. lt's me. lt's Josh.

1099
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:31,484
-Josh?
-Yeah.

1100
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:34,278
She's probably strung out on something.

1101
00:59:34,363 --> 00:59:37,448
l'm sorry. l'm sorry. l'm sorry.

1102
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:39,951
-l'm sorry.
-You ain't gotta be sorry.

1103
00:59:40,035 --> 00:59:41,202
All right?

1104
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:43,913
-Just try to... Try to relax.
-Okay, rest, rest.

1105
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:47,541
Josh, l promise, l'm trying to stop.
l'm trying to...

1106
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:48,876
Rest. Rest.

1107
00:59:48,961 --> 00:59:51,295
You have never done that for me.

1108
00:59:56,969 --> 00:59:58,803
What are you talking about, Linda?

1109
00:59:58,887 --> 01:00:02,098
This. The care that you're showing her.

1110
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:04,684
You've never done that for me.

1111
01:00:07,479 --> 01:00:09,522
Baby, please, not tonight.

1112
01:00:10,774 --> 01:00:11,857
Okay?

1113
01:00:12,192 --> 01:00:14,151
Josh, you're in love with her.

1114
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:16,821
Babe, what are you talking about?
l'm just trying to help out a friend.

1115
01:00:17,698 --> 01:00:21,200
l don't even know how to compete
with a drug-addicted prostitute.

1116
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:24,078
Linda, there's nothing going on with us.

1117
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:26,706
l have to go right now. l can't do this.

1118
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:28,958
-l can't do this, Josh. No. l'm sorry.
-Where are you going?

1119
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:31,502
-l can't do this right now.
-Linda.

1120
01:00:34,506 --> 01:00:37,049
Please come and lay with me. Please.

1121
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:39,427
Look, Candy...

1122
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:43,139
l don't think that'd be a good idea.

1123
01:00:43,223 --> 01:00:45,933
Josh, l don't mean like that.
l mean, remember when we were little

1124
01:00:46,018 --> 01:00:50,938
and my stepdad would be trying to get me
and you'd protect me.

1125
01:00:51,023 --> 01:00:53,274
Please, Josh, please.

1126
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:55,067
Josh, please, Josh.

1127
01:01:04,328 --> 01:01:05,661
All right.

1128
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:09,832
-All right.
-Please.

1129
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:11,542
All right.

1130
01:01:14,046 --> 01:01:16,047
Okay. lt's gonna be okay.

1131
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:18,382
lt's gonna be okay.

1132
01:01:19,551 --> 01:01:22,303
This is the DeKalb County SWAT team.

1133
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:25,306
Put your hands in the air
and walk backwards.

1134
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:39,362
You have the right
to speak to an attorney...

1135
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:40,446
-Don't move!
-l tell you what,

1136
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:41,864
l ain't going down without a fight!

1137
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:43,991
Come on, you bad.
What you gonna do? Come on.

1138
01:01:44,076 --> 01:01:45,993
You have the right to remain...
What the hell!

1139
01:01:46,078 --> 01:01:47,453
Don't move.

1140
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:49,330
Get off of me now!

1141
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:52,583
You're giving me a mammogram.
You squeezing my...

1142
01:02:12,396 --> 01:02:13,604
Candace.

1143
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:17,691
Candy?

1144
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:35,292
Okay.

1145
01:02:36,837 --> 01:02:38,295
Good morning.

1146
01:02:38,964 --> 01:02:39,964
You scared me.

1147
01:02:40,048 --> 01:02:41,632
What are you doing here so early?

1148
01:02:42,134 --> 01:02:44,135
l am preparing for court.

1149
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:47,430
You are preparing for court, huh?

1150
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:51,809
This is the... Candace Collins.

1151
01:02:52,227 --> 01:02:54,228
Sarah Lester. Wait, whoa.

1152
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:56,105
l remember this one.

1153
01:02:56,648 --> 01:02:58,107
This is Sarah Lester.

1154
01:02:59,151 --> 01:03:01,277
Yeah. Sarah... Sarah Lester.

1155
01:03:01,653 --> 01:03:04,321
This case was closed a couple years ago.

1156
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:10,077
Are you padding
this woman's file with a closed case?

1157
01:03:10,162 --> 01:03:11,912
Chuck, let me handle this, all right?

1158
01:03:11,997 --> 01:03:14,331
-You can't do that, Linda.
-lt's done.

1159
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:15,416
So, wait, wait, wait.

1160
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:18,419
ls this how you been
winning all your cases?

1161
01:03:18,837 --> 01:03:21,505
ls this how you've been
winning all your cases, Linda?

1162
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:23,924
l'm not gonna stand by
and let you do this, okay?

1163
01:03:24,009 --> 01:03:27,011
-l've got to...
-What? What do you have to do?

1164
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:30,139
Don't you forget your bar exam, baby.

1165
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:32,224
Remember how you cheated?

1166
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:37,188
Don't try me, Chuck. l have the proof.

1167
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:39,190
And l will use it.

1168
01:03:43,111 --> 01:03:44,987
Why are you doing this?

1169
01:03:45,322 --> 01:03:47,823
l mean, this woman
has done nothing to you...

1170
01:03:47,908 --> 01:03:49,867
How would you know that?

1171
01:03:53,914 --> 01:03:55,956
He's not in love with her.

1172
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:58,334
He loves you.

1173
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,879
How deep is your commitment
to this girl, Josh?

1174
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:04,048
She's a friend.

1175
01:04:05,175 --> 01:04:06,425
A friend?

1176
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:11,430
You know what a binge addict is?

1177
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:13,557
No.

1178
01:04:13,642 --> 01:04:16,560
They can stay clean for long periods of time

1179
01:04:17,229 --> 01:04:18,687
and then something sets them off

1180
01:04:18,772 --> 01:04:22,816
and they can go off
for days, weeks, and binge.

1181
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:28,531
'Cause this doesn't just go away like a cold.
This is a disease that has to be cured.

1182
01:04:29,157 --> 01:04:33,953
And if you're in it for the wrong reasons,
it's gonna destroy you so fast.

1183
01:04:37,666 --> 01:04:38,707
l'm gonna ask you again.

1184
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:41,919
How deep is your commitment
to this girl, Josh?

1185
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:55,015
When we were both back in college,

1186
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:57,017
she...

1187
01:04:57,852 --> 01:05:01,730
l was the only person
that she knew at the school.

1188
01:05:02,274 --> 01:05:04,358
And l knew her from the neighborhood.

1189
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:07,987
You know, the other students,
they really used to make fun of her.

1190
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:11,031
You know, like, her hair and her clothes.

1191
01:05:11,116 --> 01:05:13,367
l started getting embarrassed.

1192
01:05:14,244 --> 01:05:16,078
And they...

1193
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:20,583
l started avoiding her.

1194
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:24,628
And l was on the football team.
We were having this, like, big party.

1195
01:05:24,963 --> 01:05:30,426
And, you know, they told me
to invite Candy over.

1196
01:05:30,635 --> 01:05:31,719
You know, so l did.

1197
01:05:31,803 --> 01:05:34,722
l had a date, you know?
l really didn't want to...

1198
01:05:34,806 --> 01:05:36,265
l didn't even really want to be there.

1199
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:39,560
They told me that they would,
you know, keep her company

1200
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:41,312
while l was gone. And

1201
01:05:42,397 --> 01:05:44,398
l came back that night,

1202
01:05:46,693 --> 01:05:47,860
and...

1203
01:05:57,912 --> 01:06:00,998
l came back from... l came back that night...

1204
01:06:05,754 --> 01:06:07,671
l came back that night,

1205
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:10,549
and l went in my room,

1206
01:06:13,011 --> 01:06:14,178
and...

1207
01:06:20,185 --> 01:06:21,310
They had...

1208
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:26,190
They raped her.

1209
01:06:26,775 --> 01:06:29,860
And l didn't do...
l didn't do nothing about it.

1210
01:06:31,571 --> 01:06:33,280
l didn't do nothing about it.

1211
01:06:33,365 --> 01:06:36,200
l'm like, "What... What..."

1212
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:39,286
But l never, like, "Candy, l'm sorry."

1213
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:41,789
l never told her l'm sorry.

1214
01:06:41,873 --> 01:06:43,540
Josh, look at me. Josh.

1215
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:46,001
You can't carry that weight.

1216
01:06:46,086 --> 01:06:48,545
-What... Oh, my God... Girl...
-Josh,

1217
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:50,381
look at me.

1218
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:52,633
-Josh, look at me.
-Yes?

1219
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:55,469
-Yeah. l'm trying.
-Look at me. Look at me.

1220
01:06:55,553 --> 01:06:58,138
-You can't carry that weight.
-Okay.

1221
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:01,975
She had problems long before that party.

1222
01:07:05,897 --> 01:07:07,147
-Mabel.
-Brown.

1223
01:07:07,232 --> 01:07:09,483
Listen, listen.
l'm trying to see Judge Mablean.

1224
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:12,403
-Will you please be quiet?
-l'm trying to pray for you. Now pray.

1225
01:07:12,487 --> 01:07:15,614
God don't like you.
He grew you in a petri dish, Brown.

1226
01:07:15,699 --> 01:07:18,158
-l'm trying to help you.
-l don't need you to help me here!

1227
01:07:18,243 --> 01:07:20,077
Hey, hey, hey, Brian.

1228
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:23,247
Judge Mablean always give me
a slap on the wrist.

1229
01:07:23,331 --> 01:07:25,999
Well, this is not Judge Mablean.
This judge is tough.

1230
01:07:26,084 --> 01:07:28,043
-How tough could he be?
-All rise!

1231
01:07:28,128 --> 01:07:30,754
The Honorable Judge Mathis presiding.

1232
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:34,633
You may be seated.

1233
01:07:34,718 --> 01:07:38,929
First case, DeKalb County
calls Mabel Simmons.

1234
01:07:39,013 --> 01:07:40,097
Wait a minute.

1235
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:42,433
-ls that who the hell l think it is?
-Yes.

1236
01:07:42,517 --> 01:07:44,268
lt's all spelled out for you there,
Your Honor.

1237
01:07:44,352 --> 01:07:46,645
Yeah, l'm looking at this case,

1238
01:07:48,231 --> 01:07:51,024
-and your record is ridiculous, ma'am.
-Thank you.

1239
01:07:51,109 --> 01:07:53,610
l don't even know
how you're still on the street.

1240
01:07:53,695 --> 01:07:56,196
-Your Honor, the reason l'm on...
-l'm talking!

1241
01:07:56,281 --> 01:07:59,533
You should have been locked up
a long time ago with this.

1242
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:02,703
-Your Honor...
-Look, l speak, you listen.

1243
01:08:03,288 --> 01:08:06,081
And then l'll allow you to respond,
you understand?

1244
01:08:06,541 --> 01:08:07,541
Yes, sir.

1245
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:10,252
Who the hell he think he talking to?
Y'all better...

1246
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:11,754
-Mabel, be quiet.
-Madea!

1247
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:13,046
You better be quiet.

1248
01:08:13,131 --> 01:08:14,423
What do you have to say for yourself?

1249
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:16,341
Oh, now is my turn to talk?

1250
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:17,509
You've heard the saying,

1251
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:20,888
"Speak when you're spoken to,
or otherwise shut up."

1252
01:08:20,972 --> 01:08:22,765
Oh, it's Simon Says.
That's how this go, huh?

1253
01:08:22,849 --> 01:08:24,600
l don't have time for this.

1254
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:26,393
lt's time for some sentencing.

1255
01:08:26,478 --> 01:08:29,313
Bailiff, what time you have on your watch?

1256
01:08:29,397 --> 01:08:30,856
Five to 1 0:00, Judge.

1257
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:33,192
Five to ten. That's your sentence.

1258
01:08:33,276 --> 01:08:34,818
-Have a good day. Next.
-Oh, hell, no! You gonna...

1259
01:08:34,903 --> 01:08:36,570
Five? You gonna give me five years?

1260
01:08:36,654 --> 01:08:38,363
You ain't gonna take me back there to jail.

1261
01:08:38,448 --> 01:08:39,740
Come on here. What you gonna do?

1262
01:08:39,824 --> 01:08:41,909
Where the hell you going?
Give me five years.

1263
01:08:41,993 --> 01:08:43,827
-l got you.
-Let's go.

1264
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:46,079
You ain't gonna take me out of here!

1265
01:08:46,164 --> 01:08:47,498
l ain't going! l ain't going!

1266
01:08:47,582 --> 01:08:49,291
-l ain't going!
-Come on!

1267
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:51,126
l ain't going! l...

1268
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:06,141
Linda.

1269
01:09:06,226 --> 01:09:08,018
-Oh, hey, baby.
-Hey.

1270
01:09:09,687 --> 01:09:12,648
-Thanks for letting me borrow this.
-Oh, sure.

1271
01:09:12,732 --> 01:09:14,024
How'd it go today?

1272
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:15,818
-Seventeen years.
-What?

1273
01:09:15,902 --> 01:09:17,694
Seventeen years?
Babe, it was only two counts.

1274
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:20,364
Sweetie, sweetie,
you didn't see her New York sheet.

1275
01:09:20,448 --> 01:09:22,407
lt is as long as my arm.

1276
01:09:22,492 --> 01:09:24,117
-Yeah.
-Wow, l had no idea.

1277
01:09:24,202 --> 01:09:26,328
-She just was...
-l know, l know. l'm sorry. l'm so sorry.

1278
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:29,373
l really tried to be lenient with her, but,

1279
01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:33,460
you know,
once the judge saw the charges...

1280
01:09:33,545 --> 01:09:36,213
And on top of that,
she didn't show up today.

1281
01:09:37,465 --> 01:09:41,885
You know, maybe it's for the best.
Maybe now she can get her life together.

1282
01:09:43,096 --> 01:09:44,847
Maybe you're right.

1283
01:09:45,932 --> 01:09:48,058
So, she still at your place?

1284
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:50,769
No, she left.

1285
01:09:51,479 --> 01:09:56,567
Maybe now l can stop being mad at you
and we can go back to planning our future?

1286
01:09:57,277 --> 01:09:58,902
l would like that.

1287
01:09:59,404 --> 01:10:00,654
Me, too.

1288
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:04,408
-All right.
-Okay.

1289
01:10:26,389 --> 01:10:27,890
How you doing?

1290
01:10:31,561 --> 01:10:33,186
Hey, sweet thing.

1291
01:10:35,106 --> 01:10:36,690
What you looking for?

1292
01:10:36,774 --> 01:10:38,191
A good time.

1293
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:40,861
What's it gonna cost me?

1294
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:43,155
l'll give you a special. $50.

1295
01:10:44,115 --> 01:10:45,324
Get in.

1296
01:10:51,456 --> 01:10:54,207
Where you going? You want to party? Huh?

1297
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:56,793
Hey.

1298
01:12:15,206 --> 01:12:17,207
Get your damn hands off me.
Put your hands down.

1299
01:12:17,291 --> 01:12:20,043
l'm telling y'all right now,
l ain't scared of none of ya.

1300
01:12:20,128 --> 01:12:21,294
l ain't scared of none of ya.

1301
01:12:21,379 --> 01:12:24,965
Yeah, keep it up. Keep it up.
l ain't scared of none of ya.

1302
01:12:25,049 --> 01:12:29,219
You ain't got it.
We ain't all gonna be the same height here.

1303
01:12:30,138 --> 01:12:32,097
l'm here. Now let me go!

1304
01:12:32,974 --> 01:12:34,391
What the hell wrong with you?

1305
01:12:34,892 --> 01:12:36,393
How you do'ern?

1306
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:40,272
Guess this is my cell.
What the hell you smiling so much for?

1307
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:42,149
You the Martha Stewart of prison
or something?

1308
01:12:42,233 --> 01:12:43,233
No.

1309
01:12:43,651 --> 01:12:44,901
l'm T.T.

1310
01:12:45,486 --> 01:12:47,362
-You're who?
-l'm T.T.

1311
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:49,281
Like two of these?

1312
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:50,574
l'm T.T.

1313
01:12:51,159 --> 01:12:54,202
-l'm...
-Oh, T.T. T.T., how you do'ern?

1314
01:12:54,287 --> 01:12:57,205
l'm Mabel, but everybody
call me Madea. Heller.

1315
01:12:57,290 --> 01:13:00,000
l'm so happy that we are sharing a cell.

1316
01:13:00,585 --> 01:13:03,587
This is your bunk. l made it for you.

1317
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:05,839
Thank you, honey. l appreciate it.

1318
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:07,174
But l ain't into none of that freaky deaky.

1319
01:13:07,258 --> 01:13:09,342
Just 'cause you making the bunk,
don't mean l'm giving you nothing.

1320
01:13:09,427 --> 01:13:11,887
You ain't getting none of this good stuff,
you understand?

1321
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:13,013
You put your hands on me,

1322
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:14,639
l'm gonna punch all that Spanish
out your throat.

1323
01:13:14,724 --> 01:13:17,267
You gonna be talking straight-up English.

1324
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:20,479
You're so funny. l was just being nice.

1325
01:13:20,563 --> 01:13:22,981
When l saw you come in, l thought,

1326
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:26,109
"l hope she's in my cell."

1327
01:13:26,611 --> 01:13:27,861
Ta-da!

1328
01:13:29,113 --> 01:13:31,448
Brownies for my brownie!

1329
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:34,117
l made them myself.

1330
01:13:34,202 --> 01:13:35,702
What the hell you mean,
"Brownies for your brownie"?

1331
01:13:35,787 --> 01:13:37,329
You trying to call me black or something?

1332
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:38,789
Brownie!

1333
01:13:38,873 --> 01:13:41,625
Ain't no oven in here.
How the hell do you make a brownie?

1334
01:13:41,709 --> 01:13:43,376
l have my ways.

1335
01:13:44,796 --> 01:13:45,837
No, thank you.

1336
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:51,051
l saw you on TV. That was a great chase.

1337
01:13:51,469 --> 01:13:52,969
How long you have here, Madea?

1338
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:55,055
They tell me l got five years.

1339
01:13:55,139 --> 01:13:57,307
But l'm breaking the hell out of here
the first chance l get.

1340
01:13:57,975 --> 01:13:59,768
Can l come with you?

1341
01:14:03,022 --> 01:14:04,981
You seem like a nice, sweet person, honey.

1342
01:14:05,066 --> 01:14:07,109
What the hell you in here for?
Stealing flowers?

1343
01:14:07,193 --> 01:14:09,236
What'd you do?
Steal some candy from the Girl Scouts?

1344
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:10,403
What?

1345
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:13,490
No.

1346
01:14:14,158 --> 01:14:15,659
l murdered 1 8 men.

1347
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:17,410
-And the...
-l'm sorry.

1348
01:14:17,495 --> 01:14:19,121
You what to a ATM?

1349
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:21,665
l murder 1 8 men.

1350
01:14:23,126 --> 01:14:27,254
-Eighty?
-Eighteen! One-eight men.

1351
01:14:31,926 --> 01:14:34,845
l'm one of the first female serial killers.

1352
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:38,348
l'm going to be here till l...die.

1353
01:14:40,059 --> 01:14:42,978
But l'll be making you brownies,
my brownie!

1354
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:56,992
Hey, which one's yours?

1355
01:14:57,076 --> 01:14:59,161
You can take either one.

1356
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:00,912
Donna?

1357
01:15:02,790 --> 01:15:04,291
Candy. Oh, my God.

1358
01:15:04,375 --> 01:15:05,542
Candy!

1359
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:08,879
How are you doing?

1360
01:15:08,963 --> 01:15:11,131
-l am so glad to see you.
-l know.

1361
01:15:11,215 --> 01:15:12,507
l didn't know what happened to you.

1362
01:15:12,592 --> 01:15:15,719
l've been trying to reach you,
but you ain't got no address.

1363
01:15:19,473 --> 01:15:20,640
You look good.

1364
01:15:20,766 --> 01:15:23,435
Yeah, l'm doing good. How you doing?

1365
01:15:26,147 --> 01:15:29,107
-What?
-They gave me 1 7 years.

1366
01:15:29,901 --> 01:15:34,029
-For... For what?
-Donna, l don't know what l'm gonna do.

1367
01:15:34,405 --> 01:15:36,406
No, that ain't right.

1368
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:37,782
They had to trump your charges.

1369
01:15:37,867 --> 01:15:41,411
l don't know what happened.
l just know this ain't right.

1370
01:15:41,787 --> 01:15:43,038
Donna,

1371
01:15:44,332 --> 01:15:46,541
what am l gonna do for 1 7 years in here?

1372
01:15:46,626 --> 01:15:48,668
l've been going to Ellen's services.

1373
01:15:48,753 --> 01:15:50,003
Now wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1374
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:52,297
She teaches classes here.
You should come.

1375
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:54,049
l ain't trying to be in no church.

1376
01:15:54,133 --> 01:15:56,718
lt's not like that.
She teaches a group session here,

1377
01:15:56,802 --> 01:15:58,678
and she's really good.

1378
01:15:59,263 --> 01:16:01,890
l mean, she preaches,
but not like a preacher, you know?

1379
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:04,601
She makes it clear
so you can understand it.

1380
01:16:04,685 --> 01:16:06,811
Well, look at me.
l've been clean all this time.

1381
01:16:07,104 --> 01:16:11,775
And, if you take a course,
you get time off your sentence.

1382
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:14,236
You should come.

1383
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:18,865
l don't know how people eat this.
This is crazy as hell.

1384
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:22,410
l've seen people on Survivor
eat better food than this.

1385
01:16:25,873 --> 01:16:28,959
She ran like she was
running from some roaches.

1386
01:16:30,253 --> 01:16:32,545
-You're a cute little thing.
-Get your hands off of me.

1387
01:16:32,630 --> 01:16:34,798
-Feisty!
-Sal, leave her alone. That's my friend.

1388
01:16:34,882 --> 01:16:36,132
Was anybody talking to you?

1389
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:38,051
Young man.

1390
01:16:40,554 --> 01:16:42,222
This little lady don't want to
be bothered with you.

1391
01:16:42,306 --> 01:16:45,725
Now get on up and go on back to
where you came from. Now, go on.

1392
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:47,852
Who you think you're talking to, old lady?

1393
01:16:52,275 --> 01:16:55,443
You don't know me.
l'm gonna give you the benefit of the doubt.

1394
01:16:55,528 --> 01:16:58,238
Now get the hell up from the table
and go on now.

1395
01:16:58,322 --> 01:17:00,073
Go on. Go on, sir. Go on.

1396
01:17:00,157 --> 01:17:02,742
l see nobody told you l run this prison.

1397
01:17:02,827 --> 01:17:04,035
l'm Big Sal.

1398
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:07,914
And what Big Sal wants, Big Sal gets.
Get it?

1399
01:17:07,999 --> 01:17:10,667
l guess nobody told you that l'm Madea.

1400
01:17:10,751 --> 01:17:14,462
Ma to the damn D-E-A.
You understand that?

1401
01:17:14,547 --> 01:17:18,341
And what l want, l get.
Do you understand me?

1402
01:17:18,426 --> 01:17:19,426
l'm from the West End.

1403
01:17:19,510 --> 01:17:22,095
That's where we cut a fool first
and run like hell afterwards.

1404
01:17:22,179 --> 01:17:24,097
You understand? You don't know me.

1405
01:17:24,181 --> 01:17:26,725
You don't know who the hell you talking to.

1406
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:29,811
l will come across this table
and rip out your urethra tube.

1407
01:17:30,396 --> 01:17:31,896
l see l have to break you in.

1408
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:34,691
You gonna get broke the hell in, but...

1409
01:17:38,571 --> 01:17:39,571
We'll have our time.

1410
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:42,157
Yes, we will. l look forward to it.

1411
01:17:43,284 --> 01:17:44,576
A officer and a gentleman.

1412
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:50,415
Get the hell on out of here
with Alvin and the two chipmunks.

1413
01:17:51,584 --> 01:17:53,126
-What the hell is that?
-Thank you.

1414
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:54,753
l wasn't doing nothing for you, honey.

1415
01:17:54,837 --> 01:17:57,672
l just don't like people
messing over nobody, that's all.

1416
01:17:58,758 --> 01:18:01,551
l'm Terry, but everybody calls me T.T.

1417
01:18:03,637 --> 01:18:05,847
She say her name's T.T.
l thought she said titty, too,

1418
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:07,265
the first time l talked to her.

1419
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:09,267
l can't understand
what the hell she's saying.

1420
01:18:09,352 --> 01:18:11,019
Yeah, l'm Candace.

1421
01:18:11,103 --> 01:18:12,479
And l'm Donna.

1422
01:18:12,563 --> 01:18:14,397
Thank you for sticking up for my friend.

1423
01:18:14,482 --> 01:18:15,732
Yeah, y'all welcome.

1424
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:22,781
You have a letter.

1425
01:18:28,079 --> 01:18:29,746
Why won't you talk to him?

1426
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:31,289
'Cause l ain't got nothing to say to him.

1427
01:18:31,374 --> 01:18:34,209
Yeah, but maybe he can help you figure out
why you're in here so long.

1428
01:18:34,293 --> 01:18:36,252
Listen. l don't want to talk to him.

1429
01:18:36,337 --> 01:18:38,797
Well, obviously,
that man wants to be there for you,

1430
01:18:38,881 --> 01:18:41,216
so why don't you just let him...
Why don't you just see him?

1431
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:43,426
Why don't you just drop it?

1432
01:18:43,969 --> 01:18:45,970
Drop it. Yeah, all right.

1433
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:51,267
So l told them
they gonna give me five years.

1434
01:18:51,352 --> 01:18:54,020
Judge Mathis.
l said, "l don't care if it's Judge Judy, hell.

1435
01:18:54,105 --> 01:18:56,106
"You ain't fittin' to give me no five years."

1436
01:18:56,190 --> 01:18:57,607
But they did, and l'm here.

1437
01:18:57,691 --> 01:18:59,526
But l've been looking for a way
to break the hell out of here.

1438
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:01,820
These folks don't know me up here.
l will set it off.

1439
01:19:01,904 --> 01:19:03,071
Hi, sweetness.

1440
01:19:05,783 --> 01:19:08,034
-This...
-You looking good.

1441
01:19:08,327 --> 01:19:11,121
Oh, listen, l know you ain't talking to me.
She must be talking to you.

1442
01:19:11,205 --> 01:19:14,416
l ain't fittin' to let her take my "vigintitive."

1443
01:19:15,709 --> 01:19:17,544
-What's so funny?
-You funny.

1444
01:19:17,628 --> 01:19:20,380
You funny as hell,
looking like Lou Ferrigno.

1445
01:19:21,298 --> 01:19:23,133
Old lady, you don't know
who you talking to.

1446
01:19:23,217 --> 01:19:24,884
Yes, l do. l'm talking to you.

1447
01:19:24,969 --> 01:19:27,554
You better back the hell up out of my face...

1448
01:19:27,638 --> 01:19:29,305
-Leave me alone.
-Go ahead on, bro.

1449
01:19:29,390 --> 01:19:32,142
Go ahead on. Go ahead on, bro.
Y'all better tell him. He don't know.

1450
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:34,727
So when are you coming to see me,
sweetness?

1451
01:19:36,605 --> 01:19:37,939
Young man?

1452
01:19:38,816 --> 01:19:41,484
Didn't this little girl tell you
she don't want to be bothered with you?

1453
01:19:41,569 --> 01:19:44,988
Why the hell do you keep talking to her?
What is wrong with you?

1454
01:19:45,072 --> 01:19:46,739
What you gonna do?

1455
01:19:52,037 --> 01:19:55,039
Now, what you gonna do?

1456
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:57,542
That's what l want to know!
What you gonna do?

1457
01:19:57,626 --> 01:19:59,627
You gonna sit there
and tell something to me?

1458
01:19:59,712 --> 01:20:01,671
-You stop it! Stop it!
-l don't need this.

1459
01:20:01,755 --> 01:20:03,423
l don't need this!

1460
01:20:03,507 --> 01:20:05,008
Please, Grandma!

1461
01:20:07,887 --> 01:20:09,220
Come on, come on, you big hefer!

1462
01:20:09,305 --> 01:20:12,307
-Come on! Over in there.
-Yeah! Come on! Yeah!

1463
01:20:16,854 --> 01:20:18,146
Cover her up here.

1464
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:20,607
Hey! What's going on in here?

1465
01:20:21,859 --> 01:20:23,276
We not doing nothing.

1466
01:20:30,201 --> 01:20:32,577
l'm just telling how good God is.

1467
01:20:35,998 --> 01:20:40,293
All right, today,
we're gonna talk about forgiveness.

1468
01:20:40,377 --> 01:20:41,878
Why is this so important?

1469
01:20:41,962 --> 01:20:43,421
Yes, T.T.?

1470
01:20:43,506 --> 01:20:45,298
Because you have to forgive

1471
01:20:45,382 --> 01:20:47,383
-to be forgiven.
-Correct.

1472
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:50,720
We must forgive others
as Christ forgave us.

1473
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:54,307
Now, last week we talked about
the first steps to forgiveness.

1474
01:20:54,391 --> 01:20:55,642
Anybody know?

1475
01:20:57,019 --> 01:21:00,480
-Acknowledging what was done.
-That's right.

1476
01:21:00,981 --> 01:21:04,150
You know, a lot of times, we don't want to
acknowledge what we've done.

1477
01:21:04,235 --> 01:21:05,693
You know, when you don't
forgive somebody,

1478
01:21:05,778 --> 01:21:09,113
you give them power over your life.

1479
01:21:09,823 --> 01:21:12,659
They're sleeping at night,
and you're walking around

1480
01:21:12,743 --> 01:21:15,203
remembering everything that they've done.

1481
01:21:15,287 --> 01:21:17,330
You all know a little bit of my testimony.

1482
01:21:17,414 --> 01:21:21,125
Sixteen years living on the street.
Drug addiction, prostitution.

1483
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:23,878
And l did it because l was hurting myself.

1484
01:21:23,963 --> 01:21:27,173
l was hurting my daddy.
l was hurting my mother.

1485
01:21:27,258 --> 01:21:30,885
l was hurting every man
that did anything bad to me.

1486
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:33,471
Until one day the Lord spoke to me.

1487
01:21:35,849 --> 01:21:37,267
And He said,

1488
01:21:38,102 --> 01:21:40,812
"Forgiveness is not for the other person.

1489
01:21:41,981 --> 01:21:43,439
"lt's for you."

1490
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:45,483
And the longer you hold on to it,

1491
01:21:45,568 --> 01:21:49,195
the longer you hold on to
the pain and the past and the hurt,

1492
01:21:49,613 --> 01:21:51,948
the longer you hold yourself back
from being free.

1493
01:21:52,032 --> 01:21:54,200
Well, l can't forgive my daddy
for what he did to me.

1494
01:21:54,285 --> 01:21:55,535
He's the reason l'm in here.

1495
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:57,829
Well, Cookie, you know what?
Don't forgive him.

1496
01:21:57,913 --> 01:22:00,331
Because he's living his life. You're in here.

1497
01:22:00,416 --> 01:22:03,334
Forgiveness is not for them. lt is for you.

1498
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:06,379
Well, l can't forgive him.
You don't know what he did to me!

1499
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:09,382
Lord, do l have to listen
to all this melodrama?

1500
01:22:09,466 --> 01:22:11,301
ls there something wrong, Ms. Simmons?

1501
01:22:13,387 --> 01:22:14,554
ls there something wrong?

1502
01:22:14,638 --> 01:22:16,973
l'm sorry, Reverend Doctor
Bishop Preacher Lady,

1503
01:22:17,057 --> 01:22:18,141
whatever your name is.

1504
01:22:18,225 --> 01:22:19,976
l don't agree with all of this stuff.

1505
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:23,229
l hear what you say about forgiveness, yes.
You supposed to forgive people.

1506
01:22:23,314 --> 01:22:25,148
But this child over here
talking about what her daddy did.

1507
01:22:25,232 --> 01:22:28,651
Honey, your daddy is somewhere
living his life, and you on lockdown.

1508
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:30,653
Honey, you're in jail 'cause of what you did.

1509
01:22:30,738 --> 01:22:33,573
Learn how to take some
responsibility for yourself.

1510
01:22:33,657 --> 01:22:36,409
For your own stuff.
l can't stand for a woman to be the victim!

1511
01:22:36,493 --> 01:22:38,411
"This person did this,
that's why l'm this way."

1512
01:22:38,495 --> 01:22:39,871
Everybody in this place has got a story.

1513
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:41,706
Your mama and your daddy
done gave you life.

1514
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:44,917
That's all they was supposed to do.
No matter how good, how bad the life was,

1515
01:22:45,002 --> 01:22:49,088
it's up to you to make something out of it.
Suck it up and shut the hell up.

1516
01:22:49,173 --> 01:22:51,466
-But you don't know what he did!
-Let her talk!

1517
01:22:55,262 --> 01:22:56,846
Thank you, Biggie Smalls.

1518
01:22:57,556 --> 01:22:59,307
l love it when you call me Big Papa.

1519
01:23:00,017 --> 01:23:01,434
You're such a gentleman.

1520
01:23:03,771 --> 01:23:05,772
They say if l come here
l can get some time off,

1521
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:07,732
and l'm just trying to get some time off.
Do my time.

1522
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:10,109
l don't want to mess with nobody.
l don't want nobody to mess with me.

1523
01:23:10,194 --> 01:23:12,612
But this is crazy.
People, all of y'all up in here

1524
01:23:12,696 --> 01:23:15,073
need to understand something, okay?

1525
01:23:15,157 --> 01:23:18,368
Everybody got a life,
and what you do with that life is up to you.

1526
01:23:18,452 --> 01:23:20,828
Stop being the victim.
That's all l got to say. l ain't...

1527
01:23:20,913 --> 01:23:23,331
l don't feel like preaching, all that stuff.
l'm gonna leave that to you.

1528
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:24,791
Matter of fact, l don't even want to be here.

1529
01:23:24,875 --> 01:23:28,252
But l got to get out of here
because this is working on my damn...

1530
01:23:28,337 --> 01:23:30,880
This is working on my nerves. Sorry.

1531
01:23:31,423 --> 01:23:33,508
l can't be bothered with this.

1532
01:23:34,218 --> 01:23:35,927
Guess she told you.

1533
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:10,062
l'm glad you decided
to let me come see you.

1534
01:25:12,608 --> 01:25:13,691
Yeah.

1535
01:25:15,527 --> 01:25:16,736
So how are you?

1536
01:25:17,946 --> 01:25:19,447
l'm making it.

1537
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:23,075
So you're getting married soon, huh?

1538
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:24,243
Yeah.

1539
01:25:26,163 --> 01:25:27,663
Congratulations.

1540
01:25:28,248 --> 01:25:29,999
Good luck with that.

1541
01:25:30,417 --> 01:25:32,627
l... l really don't know what to say.

1542
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:35,463
l feel like l keep letting you down.

1543
01:25:36,423 --> 01:25:38,382
l've been going to Ellen.

1544
01:25:38,467 --> 01:25:41,969
And l've really been listening
to what she has to say.

1545
01:25:42,054 --> 01:25:44,764
And she says that if you love the Lord,

1546
01:25:45,349 --> 01:25:47,350
then everything's gonna
work out for good for you.

1547
01:25:47,434 --> 01:25:49,185
Do you believe that?

1548
01:25:50,229 --> 01:25:52,355
Yeah. Yeah, l believe that.

1549
01:25:52,981 --> 01:25:54,774
l know l do 'cause...

1550
01:25:55,692 --> 01:25:57,235
Josh, l gotta believe in something.

1551
01:25:57,694 --> 01:25:59,278
You can believe in me.

1552
01:25:59,696 --> 01:26:02,031
l know l wasn't there that night,

1553
01:26:02,115 --> 01:26:04,700
but l guarantee that'll never happen again.

1554
01:26:09,456 --> 01:26:12,667
Did you know they were
gonna do that to me that night?

1555
01:26:16,964 --> 01:26:20,466
Did you know that they were
gonna do that to me that night?

1556
01:26:20,843 --> 01:26:22,593
No, Candy, l didn't.

1557
01:26:22,678 --> 01:26:24,387
Josh, l needed you.

1558
01:26:24,930 --> 01:26:27,139
You weren't there for me.

1559
01:26:27,224 --> 01:26:30,393
You weren't there. l screamed for you.

1560
01:26:31,979 --> 01:26:34,689
And you never came for me.
You left me there.

1561
01:26:34,773 --> 01:26:35,898
Candy.

1562
01:26:36,316 --> 01:26:38,192
You didn't protect me.

1563
01:26:39,653 --> 01:26:41,279
Candy, l'm sorry.

1564
01:26:42,114 --> 01:26:43,781
Please forgive me.

1565
01:26:45,868 --> 01:26:47,118
Please.

1566
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:49,704
l was so mad at you, Josh.

1567
01:26:49,788 --> 01:26:52,415
l was so angry for so long.

1568
01:26:54,835 --> 01:26:56,252
But, Josh...

1569
01:26:57,170 --> 01:27:01,257
l forgive you.

1570
01:27:01,592 --> 01:27:04,343
You gotta go on,
and you gotta live your life,

1571
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:06,804
and l gotta live mine.

1572
01:27:06,889 --> 01:27:09,307
l'm not gonna be a victim anymore.

1573
01:27:09,892 --> 01:27:11,559
l gotta change my life for me.

1574
01:27:11,643 --> 01:27:13,269
Now you, go get married.

1575
01:27:13,770 --> 01:27:15,062
Be happy.

1576
01:27:15,355 --> 01:27:17,773
And l'm gonna try to do the same thing.

1577
01:27:24,615 --> 01:27:25,823
l gotta go.

1578
01:27:27,701 --> 01:27:29,660
Have a good wedding day.

1579
01:27:45,177 --> 01:27:46,719
Joshua? Joshua!

1580
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:48,638
Why are you not dressed?

1581
01:27:48,722 --> 01:27:51,390
Get the jacket on.
Linda's gonna be here in five minutes,

1582
01:27:51,475 --> 01:27:53,392
and l am not getting
cussed out behind you.

1583
01:27:53,477 --> 01:27:54,477
Get yourjacket on.

1584
01:27:54,561 --> 01:27:56,228
The mayor and the governor
are out there right now.

1585
01:27:56,313 --> 01:27:58,230
Are you gonna make them wait?
You just gonna make them wait?

1586
01:27:58,315 --> 01:27:59,357
-You gonna keep working?
-Whoa. My goodness.

1587
01:27:59,441 --> 01:28:00,483
-You gonna look at me like l'm stupid?
-Okay.

1588
01:28:00,567 --> 01:28:02,485
l will be out there. Thank you.

1589
01:28:02,569 --> 01:28:04,236
-Thank you, Josh. Thanks a lot.
-Just calm down. Calm down.

1590
01:28:04,321 --> 01:28:07,156
-Nice. Nice.
-l got it. l got it. l got it.

1591
01:28:08,033 --> 01:28:09,033
-Josh.
-Hey.

1592
01:28:09,117 --> 01:28:10,117
What are you doing?

1593
01:28:10,202 --> 01:28:11,786
Okay. lt's your wedding day.
Why are you working?

1594
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:14,121
-Brother, get dressed.
-l'm getting dressed, man.

1595
01:28:14,206 --> 01:28:16,916
l'm getting dressed. Yeah, you're right.

1596
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:21,879
Hey, l was looking at...

1597
01:28:22,756 --> 01:28:26,425
l was looking at Candy's file. And...

1598
01:28:28,804 --> 01:28:29,845
Something's not adding up.

1599
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:33,516
A girl gets 1 7 years, right?

1600
01:28:33,684 --> 01:28:36,602
And the maximum of this count is...

1601
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:40,690
lt's strange.

1602
01:28:44,569 --> 01:28:46,904
Josh, l gotta tell you something.

1603
01:29:21,314 --> 01:29:23,649
The couple has written their own vows.

1604
01:29:23,942 --> 01:29:28,571
These vows are from the heart
and will bind them together forever.

1605
01:29:30,574 --> 01:29:31,699
Josh,

1606
01:29:32,576 --> 01:29:34,577
you are my heart and soul.

1607
01:29:36,329 --> 01:29:38,622
l thank God for you every day.

1608
01:29:38,707 --> 01:29:42,251
l promise to love you
in sickness and in health.

1609
01:29:43,754 --> 01:29:46,422
l promise to give myself only to you.

1610
01:29:47,758 --> 01:29:49,925
And l promise to be honest

1611
01:29:51,595 --> 01:29:54,013
and to love you forever and ever.

1612
01:29:57,184 --> 01:29:58,434
Linda,

1613
01:29:59,019 --> 01:30:02,480
l will always know
that you are a wonderful woman.

1614
01:30:04,858 --> 01:30:07,276
But you are a conniving

1615
01:30:07,569 --> 01:30:10,279
and a manipulating human being,

1616
01:30:10,363 --> 01:30:12,114
and you disgust me.

1617
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:16,410
Joshua.

1618
01:30:19,289 --> 01:30:20,456
Ladies and gentlemen,

1619
01:30:20,916 --> 01:30:25,503
this beautiful, insecure woman
that l refuse to marry,

1620
01:30:25,587 --> 01:30:29,924
she padded charges on a case
that she handled,

1621
01:30:30,175 --> 01:30:33,928
sending somebody to jail for time
that they did not deserve.

1622
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:46,982
Thank you, man.

1623
01:31:09,005 --> 01:31:09,964
What are you doing here?

1624
01:31:10,048 --> 01:31:12,299
-You're supposed to be getting...
-Hey, Candy. Candy. Come here.

1625
01:31:12,384 --> 01:31:13,717
Come here.

1626
01:31:14,678 --> 01:31:15,719
No touching.

1627
01:31:15,804 --> 01:31:17,096
Shut up, man!

1628
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:20,516
-What are you doing?
-l gotta get you out of here, okay?

1629
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:22,351
l gotta get you out of here.
l gotta take you home.

1630
01:31:22,435 --> 01:31:25,104
-You understand me?
-What are you talking about?

1631
01:31:25,188 --> 01:31:26,355
l'm gonna get you out of here.

1632
01:31:26,439 --> 01:31:29,817
Linda is the last person in my life
that l'm gonna let hurt you.

1633
01:31:29,901 --> 01:31:31,402
l'm gonna be here for you.

1634
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:34,738
l'm gonna help you kick that crap
and the streets and all the other stuff

1635
01:31:34,823 --> 01:31:38,367
if it takes every breath in my body.
You understand me?

1636
01:31:38,451 --> 01:31:39,785
l love you.

1637
01:31:45,709 --> 01:31:47,084
No touching.

1638
01:31:48,795 --> 01:31:50,421
The heck with it.

1639
01:32:07,814 --> 01:32:10,482
lt's a public issue
because justice is for everyone.

1640
01:32:10,567 --> 01:32:11,567
God bless you.

1641
01:32:11,651 --> 01:32:13,068
You're on with Frank and Wanda. Hello?

1642
01:32:13,153 --> 01:32:15,321
It was when I was
reviewing Candace Washington's file

1643
01:32:15,405 --> 01:32:17,531
that I discovered Linda Davis had tried...

1644
01:32:17,616 --> 01:32:19,992
...judges who presided over each case
gave sentences...

1645
01:32:20,076 --> 01:32:21,952
The goal of the District Attorney's office

1646
01:32:22,037 --> 01:32:25,164
is to see that these seven
unjustly imprisoned women

1647
01:32:25,248 --> 01:32:27,666
be released immediately
and be reunited with their loved ones.

1648
01:32:27,751 --> 01:32:29,126
lt's 1 5 past the hour.

1649
01:32:29,211 --> 01:32:30,669
And it's The Tom Joyner Morning Show.

1650
01:32:30,754 --> 01:32:32,963
Sybil, this morning l am outraged.

1651
01:32:33,048 --> 01:32:37,593
l am outraged about this prosecutor
that has got Madea in jail.

1652
01:32:37,677 --> 01:32:40,554
This story is so unbelievable to me.
There is...

1653
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:42,473
This is Reverend Al Sharpton. We're back.

1654
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:45,100
l want to talk about
this hotshot district attorney

1655
01:32:45,185 --> 01:32:48,354
that's trying to build up a career,
trumping up charges on...

1656
01:32:48,438 --> 01:32:51,899
lt's Michael Baisden.
First the Gina Six, now the Georgia Seven,

1657
01:32:51,983 --> 01:32:55,694
which includes Madea,
an elderly woman sentenced for five years

1658
01:32:55,779 --> 01:32:58,197
for a victimless crime.
You know l would do it...

1659
01:32:58,281 --> 01:33:00,783
lt's 1 7 minutes after the hour.
Welcome back to the ride, y'all,

1660
01:33:00,867 --> 01:33:02,534
on The Steve Harvey Morning Show.

1661
01:33:02,619 --> 01:33:05,913
Call us because Madea deserves to be free.

1662
01:33:05,997 --> 01:33:09,625
...march down to the D.A.'s office
and get this accomplished!

1663
01:33:15,757 --> 01:33:18,509
We are back. Now, Mabel Simmons,

1664
01:33:18,593 --> 01:33:23,722
also known to the general population
as Madea, has been arrested,

1665
01:33:23,807 --> 01:33:26,558
and there's been yet another
"Free Madea" rally.

1666
01:33:26,643 --> 01:33:27,977
Now, come on.

1667
01:33:28,061 --> 01:33:30,396
-Okay, she carries a gun!
-She has to carry...

1668
01:33:30,647 --> 01:33:34,400
But she has to carry a gun.
She's a vulnerable, older black woman.

1669
01:33:34,484 --> 01:33:36,318
-Madea is not vulnerable.
-They're out to get her.

1670
01:33:36,403 --> 01:33:37,486
That's how l see it.

1671
01:33:37,570 --> 01:33:39,446
We have a right to carry
our guns and bear arms.

1672
01:33:39,531 --> 01:33:40,572
lt's in our Constitution.

1673
01:33:40,657 --> 01:33:43,033
She bears all those arms. She got guns.

1674
01:33:43,118 --> 01:33:44,785
She's just cutting people down.

1675
01:33:44,869 --> 01:33:46,412
And she was not the only one.

1676
01:33:46,496 --> 01:33:49,915
You put six, seven women in jail,
and with these kind of sentences,

1677
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,668
l mean, is this the kind ofjustice
we're looking for in the United States?

1678
01:33:52,752 --> 01:33:53,752
We have a news alert.

1679
01:33:53,837 --> 01:33:55,754
l am standing in front
of the Georgia State Courthouse,

1680
01:33:55,839 --> 01:33:58,132
where Assistant District Attorney
Linda Davis

1681
01:33:58,216 --> 01:34:04,179
was indicted today by a grand jury,
and the charges include fraud, tampering,

1682
01:34:04,264 --> 01:34:06,765
-and providing false documents.
-Man, l wish that chick had tried my case.

1683
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:11,186
At some point, maybe today,
maybe tomorrow, but at some point soon,

1684
01:34:11,271 --> 01:34:13,772
Linda Davis will have to turn herself in

1685
01:34:13,857 --> 01:34:14,982
-to the authorities...
-l don't believe that.

1686
01:34:15,066 --> 01:34:18,610
...and she will be officially processed.
What does that mean?

1687
01:34:18,695 --> 01:34:20,696
-That means that she will be fingerprinted...
-Unbelievable.

1688
01:34:20,780 --> 01:34:24,533
...and at some point,
she will stand against the wall of shame

1689
01:34:24,617 --> 01:34:29,538
and have her mug shot taken.
What a fall from grace for Linda Davis.

1690
01:34:30,165 --> 01:34:32,082
Turn the TV on!
We're sitting here looking at that!

1691
01:34:32,167 --> 01:34:33,250
What the hell's wrong with you?

1692
01:34:33,335 --> 01:34:36,337
Bernice Davis, lda Mae Jones,

1693
01:34:36,421 --> 01:34:39,590
Taketa Matthews, Andrea Thomas,

1694
01:34:39,674 --> 01:34:42,426
Candace Collins, Mabel Simmons,

1695
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:44,386
and Elizabeth Bryant.

1696
01:34:44,471 --> 01:34:46,680
There's been an investigation
in the D.A.'s offices

1697
01:34:46,765 --> 01:34:49,391
that has led
to the overturning of your convictions.

1698
01:34:49,809 --> 01:34:52,311
Get your things. You're going home.

1699
01:34:52,896 --> 01:34:54,021
What?

1700
01:34:54,898 --> 01:34:56,565
You're going home!

1701
01:34:57,067 --> 01:35:00,027
-This has got to be some kind ofjoke.
-Girl, go.

1702
01:35:00,111 --> 01:35:01,570
-Really?
-Yes.

1703
01:35:01,946 --> 01:35:02,988
Bye, Madea!

1704
01:35:03,365 --> 01:35:04,948
So you feel like justice has been served?

1705
01:35:05,033 --> 01:35:08,660
Yeah, justice is served.
You know, justice with...

1706
01:35:08,745 --> 01:35:11,330
Brian know about the justice
'cause he in justice.

1707
01:35:11,414 --> 01:35:14,041
l just think that we all are really,
really happy

1708
01:35:14,125 --> 01:35:16,919
-that this justice has been overturned.
-Yes, and you know what?

1709
01:35:17,003 --> 01:35:19,338
l'm gonna go buy her
a white dress with a white hat,

1710
01:35:19,422 --> 01:35:22,257
and white ruffled panties
and white ruffled socks and white shoes.

1711
01:35:22,342 --> 01:35:23,425
She's going to church this time.

1712
01:35:23,510 --> 01:35:25,010
You know, a better person to ask is Madea.

1713
01:35:25,095 --> 01:35:26,345
-Here she comes now.
-l'm out ofjail!

1714
01:35:26,429 --> 01:35:31,058
l watched the news! l watched the news!
l watched the news!

1715
01:35:33,561 --> 01:35:34,937
Soulja Boy!

1716
01:35:37,857 --> 01:35:39,858
l ain't got nothing to say.
l have nothing to say at all.

1717
01:35:39,943 --> 01:35:42,403
lt's just been really tough
being up in that prison.

1718
01:35:42,487 --> 01:35:45,364
And they really did all this stuff
to try to get me down.

1719
01:35:45,448 --> 01:35:49,076
But you can't keep me down.
Praise the Lord. God bless you. Hallelujer.

1720
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:52,371
Wait! Wait! Let's go, then.

1721
01:35:52,455 --> 01:35:55,999
Mabel, you're going to church.
We're gonna take you to church.

1722
01:36:22,735 --> 01:36:24,695
They tell me you're the best.

1723
01:36:24,779 --> 01:36:28,031
Well, look, l don't usually do this.
l mean, you need to know that.

1724
01:36:28,116 --> 01:36:29,992
l don't usually see people individually.

1725
01:36:30,076 --> 01:36:33,412
l saw the videotape of you getting arrested

1726
01:36:33,496 --> 01:36:35,998
and l thought,
"l have got to see this woman."

1727
01:36:36,082 --> 01:36:39,168
You can't think what you did was okay.

1728
01:36:39,711 --> 01:36:40,752
You don't know what happened.

1729
01:36:40,837 --> 01:36:41,837
What do you mean,
l don't know what happened?

1730
01:36:41,921 --> 01:36:45,591
l saw it on tape.
l saw you forklift a lady's car

1731
01:36:45,675 --> 01:36:47,718
out of a parking space.

1732
01:36:47,802 --> 01:36:49,303
You talking about that time.
l've been on several tapes.

1733
01:36:49,387 --> 01:36:51,180
l ain't know what you talking about. But...

1734
01:36:51,264 --> 01:36:52,431
They have that on video, too?

1735
01:36:52,515 --> 01:36:54,141
You know what happened?
That woman just...

1736
01:36:54,225 --> 01:36:56,143
l been riding around that parking lot
in the heat.

1737
01:36:56,227 --> 01:36:57,769
My air conditioner don't work
in my Cadillac.

1738
01:36:57,854 --> 01:36:59,062
l got that '78 Cadillac.

1739
01:36:59,147 --> 01:37:02,441
And l was driving around, driving around,
and could not get a parking spot.

1740
01:37:02,525 --> 01:37:05,694
And there she was, zoomed in there,
knew l was waiting for that spot.

1741
01:37:05,778 --> 01:37:06,862
What else was l supposed to do?

1742
01:37:06,946 --> 01:37:11,617
You go on to another space.
Do you have to be in control all the time?

1743
01:37:12,702 --> 01:37:14,661
No, l don't have to be in control all the time.

1744
01:37:14,746 --> 01:37:17,456
But that was my parking spot.
l wasn't going to another space.

1745
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:20,083
That was the closest one to the door
and that's the one l wanted.

1746
01:37:20,168 --> 01:37:22,920
Other people want stuff, too.
lt's not just about you.

1747
01:37:23,004 --> 01:37:25,130
lt's not just about you all the time.

1748
01:37:25,215 --> 01:37:26,798
ln my world, it's about me.

1749
01:37:26,883 --> 01:37:29,551
This is Madea's world.
lt's about me, Dr. Phil.

1750
01:37:29,636 --> 01:37:31,887
So, do you get angry
when you feel out of control?

1751
01:37:32,263 --> 01:37:35,849
l'm never angry.
l keep telling people l am not angry, okay?

1752
01:37:35,934 --> 01:37:37,809
lf somebody do something to me,
l do something back to them.

1753
01:37:37,894 --> 01:37:39,978
You don't bother me, l don't bother you.
That's just common sense.

1754
01:37:40,063 --> 01:37:42,564
So you weren't angry when you took
this lady's car and flipped it over?

1755
01:37:42,649 --> 01:37:44,399
Not at all. l was calm.
As cool as a cucumber.

1756
01:37:44,484 --> 01:37:47,069
-l was sitting there smoking a cigarette.
-Are you crazy?

1757
01:37:47,153 --> 01:37:49,404
-A little bit.
-Okay, l got a question for you.

1758
01:37:49,489 --> 01:37:50,989
Okay, l got a question for you, too.

1759
01:37:51,074 --> 01:37:53,325
-What about your childhood?
-What about your childhood?

1760
01:37:53,409 --> 01:37:56,078
Talking about my childhood's
not going to help you with your anger.

1761
01:37:56,162 --> 01:37:57,829
How do you know l'm angry?
l keep saying that l'm not.

1762
01:37:57,914 --> 01:37:59,331
But you keep insisting that l am.

1763
01:37:59,415 --> 01:38:01,166
-What's going on?
-Are you happy to be here talking to me?

1764
01:38:01,251 --> 01:38:02,668
No, l would rather...

1765
01:38:02,752 --> 01:38:04,878
l'd much rather be at the casino
playing blackjack or something.

1766
01:38:04,963 --> 01:38:06,505
But they told me
l have to come here and see you.

1767
01:38:06,589 --> 01:38:07,673
-So l'm here.
-Why?

1768
01:38:07,757 --> 01:38:09,424
Because the court made me come.

1769
01:38:09,509 --> 01:38:13,387
You forklift a woman's car
out of the parking lot!

1770
01:38:13,471 --> 01:38:15,222
Does that seem reasonable to you?

1771
01:38:15,306 --> 01:38:16,682
She took the parking spot.

1772
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:18,892
lt isn't your parking spot.

1773
01:38:18,977 --> 01:38:20,394
Yes, it was.
l was standing there waiting for it.

1774
01:38:20,478 --> 01:38:22,354
-Did it have your name on it?
-You didn't see it.

1775
01:38:22,438 --> 01:38:23,939
Did it have your name on it?

1776
01:38:24,524 --> 01:38:26,984
lt had handicap.
And that matches what l had in my car.

1777
01:38:27,068 --> 01:38:30,320
She just took it with her red convertible,
so l lifted it, flipped it. That's right.

1778
01:38:30,989 --> 01:38:33,907
Well, yeah, l believe the handicap part.
l got that.

1779
01:38:33,992 --> 01:38:36,577
Oh, wow. What are you trying to say?
You saying something's wrong with me?

1780
01:38:36,661 --> 01:38:39,288
Did you see me walk in here? l'm fine.

1781
01:38:39,372 --> 01:38:41,206
Then what are you doing
in a handicap space?

1782
01:38:41,291 --> 01:38:42,916
Because it was closer to the door.

1783
01:38:45,169 --> 01:38:46,169
What?

1784
01:38:52,635 --> 01:38:53,635
Because it was closer to the door.

1785
01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:56,221
And they always leave the spot,
the handicap, close to the door.

1786
01:38:56,306 --> 01:38:57,389
That's why l take 'em.

1787
01:38:57,473 --> 01:38:59,933
Do you feel like
you always have to get even?

1788
01:39:00,643 --> 01:39:01,977
Hell, yeah.

1789
01:39:02,061 --> 01:39:03,103
Why do you always have to get even?

1790
01:39:03,187 --> 01:39:06,732
Why can't you just let it roll off
like water off a duck's back?

1791
01:39:06,816 --> 01:39:08,150
'Cause l ain't no damn duck.

1792
01:39:08,484 --> 01:39:10,319
You don't have to
attack people all the time!

1793
01:39:10,403 --> 01:39:12,696
lf somebody do something to you,
you supposed to do something to him.

1794
01:39:12,780 --> 01:39:13,739
That's what the Bible say.

1795
01:39:13,823 --> 01:39:17,075
The Bible say in ll "Deuteronomo"
of the book of Jericho

1796
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:19,745
that the eye for the tooth
and the tooth for the people

1797
01:39:19,829 --> 01:39:21,663
and everybody who got the eye,
you punch 'em in it.

1798
01:39:23,625 --> 01:39:24,750
What?

1799
01:39:24,834 --> 01:39:26,376
l can tell you don't read the Bible.

1800
01:39:26,669 --> 01:39:28,420
So the Bible say turn the other cheek.

1801
01:39:28,504 --> 01:39:30,255
So somebody hit that cheek,
you turn to the other cheek.

1802
01:39:30,340 --> 01:39:31,590
You only have two cheeks.

1803
01:39:31,674 --> 01:39:34,259
Now how many cheeks you supposed to
let them hit before you whoop their ass?

1804
01:39:34,344 --> 01:39:36,303
Well, l don't think you ever
have to whoop their ass.

1805
01:39:36,387 --> 01:39:37,763
lt ain't about ass-whoopin'.

1806
01:39:37,847 --> 01:39:40,891
You don't open up a can of whoop ass
on everybody that you meet.

1807
01:39:40,975 --> 01:39:42,934
-You go with the flow.
-What do you mean?

1808
01:39:43,019 --> 01:39:44,853
Just letting people
walk over you like a doormat?

1809
01:39:44,937 --> 01:39:47,773
That's crazy as hell.
No, l've been in this life too long

1810
01:39:47,857 --> 01:39:50,734
to let some people just walk all over me.
l'm not fittin' to do that.

1811
01:39:50,818 --> 01:39:53,153
But it's easy for you
to get bothered, isn't it?

1812
01:39:53,237 --> 01:39:54,363
-No, it's not.
-lt doesn't take a whole lot

1813
01:39:54,447 --> 01:39:56,573
for you to get bothered.

1814
01:39:56,658 --> 01:39:57,949
No, it doesn't.

1815
01:39:58,034 --> 01:39:59,493
Yes, it does.

1816
01:39:59,577 --> 01:40:01,203
l beg to differ.

1817
01:40:01,871 --> 01:40:05,165
-Do you sleep well at night?
-Do you sleep well at night?

1818
01:40:06,334 --> 01:40:09,461
Okay, let's try not to answer a question
with a question, okay?

1819
01:40:09,545 --> 01:40:11,296
Well, if you stop asking questions,

1820
01:40:11,381 --> 01:40:12,798
l'll stop answering a question
with a question.

1821
01:40:12,882 --> 01:40:15,425
-Can you stop?
-Can you stop?

1822
01:40:17,011 --> 01:40:18,887
Okay. All right. Look.

1823
01:40:18,971 --> 01:40:20,138
Are you getting angry, Doctor?

1824
01:40:20,223 --> 01:40:22,808
Yeah, l'm getting angry.
Answer the question!

1825
01:40:22,892 --> 01:40:23,975
Answer what question?

1826
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:26,311
This isn't working. This isn't helping.

1827
01:40:26,396 --> 01:40:29,398
l don't think it's helping, either.
l told the judge l didn't need to come here.

1828
01:40:29,482 --> 01:40:31,274
-But you're here.
-Yes, l am here.

1829
01:40:31,359 --> 01:40:32,442
You're not making any sense.

1830
01:40:32,527 --> 01:40:34,444
-You're not making any sense!
-Do people...

1831
01:40:34,529 --> 01:40:36,363
Do you talk to people like this all the time?

1832
