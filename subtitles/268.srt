to feel how someone else feels.

465
00:36:42,965 --> 00:36:46,953
I'm just a kid. I'm not supposed
to be by myself all the time.

466
00:36:47,053 --> 00:36:50,773
This is child endangerment.
Which is a crime, by the way.

467
00:36:50,873 --> 00:36:55,461
But when I founded you, you were already
alone, so I thinks it is normal for you.

468
00:36:55,561 --> 00:36:58,211
When Boov are young,
we are kept in the warming oven.

470
00:37:04,487 --> 00:37:06,889
Is this normal for humanspersons?

471
00:37:06,989 --> 00:37:12,511
Well... usually, we don't cross the Atlantic
by ourselves until we're 16.

472
00:37:12,611 --> 00:37:17,442
No, none of this is normal!
Don't you get it? You ruined everything!

473
00:37:17,542 --> 00:37:23,173
I was finally happy here...
there, where I lived. With my mom.

474
00:37:23,673 --> 00:37:27,644
Do you know how hard it was
for me to fit in? How long that took?

475
00:37:27,844 --> 00:37:30,079

476
00:37:30,179 --> 00:37:35,918
Yes, I sees that! I did not realize!
We will resume the finding of Mimom.

477
00:37:36,018 --> 00:37:40,340
Stop saying that! She's just "my" mom.

478
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:45,178
Not yours. Mine.
How do you not understand this?

479
00:37:45,278 --> 00:37:49,932
How would you feel if some horrible aliens
took your mother from you?

480
00:37:50,032 --> 00:37:55,044
That could not to happen.
Boov are not having mimoms.

481
00:37:55,621 --> 00:37:58,680
Boov don't have families.

482
00:37:59,308 --> 00:38:03,238
No wonder you take things
and don't care about anybody else.

483
00:38:07,149 --> 00:38:09,952
So, your mimom...

484
00:38:10,052 --> 00:38:12,955
is a very important humansperson to you.

485
00:38:13,055 --> 00:38:15,392
More important than others.

486
00:38:15,492 --> 00:38:19,842
To not belong with her causes
you being sad.

487
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:27,403
But recent moments ago,
you are kicking on me and yelling.

488
00:38:27,503 --> 00:38:32,100
Which is seeming more to be
mad than sad.

489
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,509
Well, sometimes it's both.

490
00:38:35,609 --> 00:38:37,814
So...

491
00:38:37,914 --> 00:38:40,105
you are sad-mad.

492
00:38:52,762 --> 00:38:56,942
Humans are more complicated
than it said in the pamphlet.

493
00:39:03,481 --> 00:39:06,121
I vacuumed here as fast as I could.

494
00:39:06,342 --> 00:39:09,045
Whatfor is your plan for figuring out
the dumb Boov's password?

495
00:39:09,445 --> 00:39:11,405

499
00:39:21,791 --> 00:39:22,859
So?

500
00:39:23,459 --> 00:39:28,719
We could type in
random numbers and letters?

501
00:39:29,006 --> 00:39:30,926
I like it!

502
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,037
Get those big brains
plugged in and working.

503
00:39:34,137 --> 00:39:36,197
Away!

504
00:39:36,305 --> 00:39:39,889
You know what the Gorg will do
if they find us. Chomp, chomp, chomp.

505
00:39:44,313 --> 00:39:46,750
And that is why we keep running away.

506
00:39:48,276 --> 00:39:51,679
- Why do these Gorg hate you so much?
- Because they are Gorg.

507
00:39:51,779 --> 00:39:54,182
We calls Gorg the "takers"

508
00:39:54,282 --> 00:39:57,660
because if you has something,
they takes it.

509
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,455
Like, if you has a sandwich.
Or a planet.

510
00:40:00,555 --> 00:40:04,901
No, no. I get it. But... they're not
coming to this planet, right?

511
00:40:05,001 --> 00:40:06,711
No, no. Not to worry.

512
00:40:06,811 --> 00:40:10,073
The Big Brain Boov
will to fix my mistake.

513
00:40:10,173 --> 00:40:13,868
But I will still be very punished.
We has a rule.

514
00:40:13,968 --> 00:40:16,454
Nine mistakes and you are out.

515
00:40:16,554 --> 00:40:20,224
- How many mistakes do you have?
- 62.

516
00:40:24,687 --> 00:40:28,549
You know, when I'm stressed out,
my mom tells me jokes.

517
00:40:28,649 --> 00:40:33,054
- Boov do not do telling jokes.
- It's not that hard. I'll teach you.

518
00:40:33,154 --> 00:40:35,223
Knock, knock.

519
00:40:35,323 --> 00:40:38,373
You would say, "Who's there?"

520
00:40:39,802 --> 00:40:42,605
- You are there.
- No, just ask me.

521
00:40:42,705 --> 00:40:46,401
- Who is there?
- Now I say, "The interrupting cow."

522
00:40:46,501 --> 00:40:49,645
Now you say,
"The interrupting cow, who?"

523
00:40:49,745 --> 00:40:52,092
Let's just do it.
Knock, knock.

524
00:40:52,192 --> 00:40:55,029
- Who is there?
- The interrupting cow.

525
00:40:55,129 --> 00:40:57,678
- The interrupting cow...
- Moo!

The cow is to being an interrupting cow
and therefore interrupts me!

531
00:41:13,403 --> 00:41:16,364
- I know. That's why it's funny.

- That's enough.
- I'm the interrupting cow.

- Knock it off!

- But doos you listen? No!
- Oh, that's enough!

You are driving me to the crazy!

540
00:41:42,698 --> 00:41:45,736
It is never too late to run away.
That is the Boov motto.

541
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:48,838
Yes, but we're not doing that.
I have a plan.

542
00:41:48,938 --> 00:41:51,708
Is your plan to run away?
Because other-way-wise, it is stupid!

543
00:41:51,808 --> 00:41:53,968
All we have to do
is sneak into the city,

544
00:41:54,068 --> 00:41:56,971
get into the Great Antenna,
use it to find my mom

545
00:41:57,071 --> 00:41:59,182
and then sneak out again. See?

546
00:41:59,282 --> 00:42:02,393
But it still will not work
because my face is known.

547
00:42:02,493 --> 00:42:06,898
If I am seen by any Boov,
I am 100% popular for being arrested.

- What if I could fix that?

628
00:47:54,854 --> 00:47:57,557
- But I would not.
- But you might.

629
00:47:57,757 --> 00:47:59,344

- We could go round and round.

- Shush! Erase him!

Or I will mess with this...

00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:24,314
She is bluffing. She could not possibly
reach the gravity thingy.

638

Curse you and your tippy-toe tallness!

639
00:48:28,021 --> 00:48:29,288
But no problem.

640
00:48:29,388 --> 00:48:34,794
Boov technology is far too complicated
for simple humansgirl to figure out.

Captain Smek telled us
that the humans needed us.

That the humans were
just like the animals...

694

and that we could to make them better...

695
00:53:22,014 --> 00:53:23,933
teach to them.

696
00:53:24,033 --> 00:53:28,847

were simple and backwards.

It is what we thought.

700
00:53:35,903 --> 00:53:38,431
that we were thinking wrong.

701
00:53:38,531 --> 00:53:41,517
And that Captain Smek is the wrongest.

00:53:41,617 --> 00:53:46,164
I am thinking the Boov
should never have come to Smekland.

703

I do not fit in.
