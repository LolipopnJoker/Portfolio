1
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:30,094
You're not cold
or anything, are you'?

2
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:31,300
Everything all right?

3
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:33,302
Are you taking any medication?

4
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:36,138
Hmm?

5
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:38,640
Thank you.

6
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:40,605
How are you doing
this morning?

7
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:44,150
- Did you have a restful sleep last night?
- Oh, yeah.

8
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,481
- You did?
- I did.

9
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:46,949
And your dreams?
Nope.

10
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,029
Sometimes we don't
remember our dreams, you know?

11
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:50,152
That's right.

12
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:52,913
We do dream, but we
don't remember when we wake up.

13
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:57,622
But if we are dreaming some just
before we wake up, we remember those.

14
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:58,827
That's right.

15
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,036
Did you know...

16
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,499
A little, uh,
useful information.

17
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:05,834
Yeah.

18
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,960
When we wake up and say,

19
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:09,672
"The whole night, I was dreaming
this and that and everything,"

20
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,348
it's only 45 minutes maximum.

21
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:14,181
Did you know that? MAN: Yeah.
No, I did not. Yeah.

22
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,978
So the ordinary dream
is 10 or 15 minutes.

23
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:19,473
I'll see you all later.

24
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,308
Where are you going?
I'm going to see my patients.

25
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,944
Testing. Testing. Check,
check, check. One, two, three.

26
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:25,646
Testing. One, two, three.

27
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:31,528
We are now at Smith's Grove,
uh, rehabilitation facility.

28
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,157
We're here today
to interview a patient

29
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:36,581
that's spent the last
40 years in captivity

30
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:41,541
and, by all accounts, has not
uttered a word. This monster...

31
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:48,920
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

32
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:52,013
I'm Dr. Ranbir Sartain.
Great to finally meet you.

33
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:55,058
Thank you so much for taking the
time to meet with us today.

34
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,555
We were hoping
to have this opportunity

35
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,433
before he's transferred
to the new facility.

36
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:00,939
Glass Hill is far less
accommodating.

37
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,391
Glass Hill is the pit of hell.

38
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,439
For years, he's been
kept here to be studied.

39
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:09,322
I suppose the state has lost interest
in discovering anything further.

40
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:11,071
Well, that's why we're here.

41
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,826
Michael has been
my life's obsession.

42
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:16,872
I've examined every single
case file written on him.

43
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:19,370
I was a student of Dr. Loomis'
before he passed away.

44
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,460
And then I lobbied
the University of Illinois

45
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,083
to be assigned
to Michael myself.

46
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:25,664
Any progress?

47
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:29,710
Well, he's been seen by over
50 clinical psychiatrists,

48
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,921
and with each,
many different opinions.

49
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,965
Dr. Loomis was the only one
to see him in the wild.

50
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,885
And he concluded he was
nothing more than pure evil.

51
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:44,817
Our patients get fresh air, sunshine, a
view, proper exercise, healthy diet.

52
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:50,318
It pains me to see him transferred to
that less-than-desirable facility.

53
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:53,484
And there he is.

54
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,871
He can speak.
He just chooses not to.

55
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:00,707
I'd love to stand
closer to him, if I may.

56
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:04,036
Get a sense of his awareness,
or lack of awareness.

57
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,500
Oh, make no mistake,
he's aware.

58
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,424
He was watching you
<i>as</i> you arrived.

59
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,299
Perhaps you'd like
to tie your left shoelace?

60
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,844
Mr. Tovoli here, the
gentleman with the umbrella,

61
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,100
has a fixation
for such things.

62
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,728
Underestimate no one.
Of course.

63
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,900
And now step up
to the yellow line.

64
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,732
And no further.

65
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,031
Do not cross the line
under any circumstances.

66
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:36,818
Michael.

67
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:39,909
Michael.

68
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:43,409
I've got some people
who'd like to meet you.

69
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,712
Hello, Michael.

70
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:51,667
My name is Aaron Korey.

71
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:57,097
I've been following your case for years
and still know very little about you.

72
00:04:58,715 --> 00:04:59,841
I'd like to know more.

73
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:02,977
About that night.

74
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:05,939
About those involved.

75
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,399
Do you ever think
about them, Michael?

76
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,898
Feel guilt about their fate?

77
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,669
I borrowed something from a friend at
the attorney general's office, Michael.

78
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,283
You feel it,
don't you, Michael?

79
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:04,698
You feel the mask.

80
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,582
Figaro. Figaro!

81
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,131
Say something, Michael.

82
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,171
Say something.

83
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:32,983
You can feel it, can't you?

84
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,446
It's a part of you, Michael.

85
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:39,983
It's a part of you.

86
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,486
Say something.

87
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,368
Say something, Michael.

88
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:01,796
Say something!

89
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,157
<i>What is it we're after?</i>

90
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,701
<i>Okay,</i> well,

91
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:50,948
having witnessed the animal
in its captive state

92
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:53,250
and failed to provoke
any sort of response,

93
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:56,749
we now track down
its counterpart.

94
00:08:57,412 --> 00:09:01,542
Could it be that one monster
has created another?

95
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,711
And although the iron bars
and barbed wire

96
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,013
that separate them
are both strong and sharp,

97
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,850
the metaphysical lines
are blurred and slight.

98
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:14,979
Both exist in isolation,
fettered by their own fear

99
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,056
- and hatred of one another.
- This one.

100
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,140
Here?

101
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:21,023
Could it be that the only hope
of rehabilitation...

102
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,522
Spooky. ...is
through confrontation?

103
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:27,325
"Access has been denied.
Private property. No trespassing."

104
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,822
You might need this.

105
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,996
Dana, journalists don't pay
for their interviews.

106
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,748
Smile. We're on camera.

107
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,841
Yes.

108
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:53,677
<i>Hello. Um...</i>

109
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:55,687
We're looking
for Laurie Strode.

110
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,435
We're, um...

111
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:06,027
We're making a podcast, and...

112
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:07,858
We're investigative
journalists.

113
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:12,696
If you have a moment, we've
traveled a very long way.

114
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,500
How does $3,000 sound?

115
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,336
Hello.

116
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,635
May we come in,
and sit down and talk?

117
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,735
So...

118
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:35,621
Aaron and I have made several
award-winning public radio exposés.

119
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:39,082
Our last project shed new light on
a murder case from 20 years ago.

120
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:43,916
We like to reexamine incidents
with an unbiased lens.

121
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,631
I believe there's a lot to learn
from the horrors you experienced.

122
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:50,464
There's nothing to learn.

123
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:55,303
There are no new insights
or discoveries.

124
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,803
So, is he real?
Who?

125
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,772
The Boogeyman.

126
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,942
I read you quoted... You don't
believe in the Boogeyman?

127
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:11,281
I believe in Michael Myers,
deranged serial killer,

128
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,363
but the Boogeyman, no.

129
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:17,825
Well, you should.

130
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,491
Okay.

131
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,918
Michael Myers is a human being

132
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,166
who killed his sister
when he was six years old.

133
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:28,373
Then he came after you.

134
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:33,428
We just want to know why. We
want a glimpse inside his mind.

135
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:36,048
That's why your story
is so important.

136
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,390
My story?

137
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:41,768
Two failed marriages.

138
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:45,690
Rocky relationship with your
daughter and granddaughter.

139
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:49,061
Michael Myers
murdered five people.

140
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:54,073
And he's a human being
we need to understand?

141
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,200
I'm twice divorced.

142
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,570
And I'm a basket case.

143
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,033
They're transferring him.

144
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,702
Tomorrow, 7:00.

145
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,580
He'll be locked away
until the end of his days.

146
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:09,831
That's the idea.

147
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,546
Let's talk about when the state
came to take your daughter away.

148
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:20,095
She was 12 years old. They
said you were an unfit mother.

149
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,014
How long until
you regained custody?

150
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,224
I didn't.

151
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,564
But you already knew that.

152
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:34,939
Laurie, we saw him.

153
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,401
We met with Michael.

154
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:39,902
I showed him the mask.

155
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,657
There was nothing.
No response. Nothing.

156
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,869
He won't talk to anyone.
Never has,

157
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,997
but I think he might
speak with you.

158
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,755
So, why don't
you sit down with him

159
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:59,431
and say all the things
you must be longing to say?

160
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:05,137
Come with us, and let us
help you free yourself.

161
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,389
Please.

162
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,023
Time's up.

163
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,077
I'll accept my payment.

164
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,328
Get out.

165
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,869
You want to shit
under my sink?

166
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,922
I will murder you
and your whole family.

167
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,802
I switched from marshmallow
fluff to peanut butter.

168
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,004
See if those little bastards
eat that.

169
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,682
That ought to kill them.
Morning.

170
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:45,101
I rescheduled my last session,
<i>so</i> I can make it tonight.

171
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,808
You really didn't have to do that, Mom.
It's not a big deal.

172
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,514
You made it into
the National Honor Society.

173
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,019
Yeah.
That is a very big deal.

174
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,063
I just made it to the top
of my shop class,

175
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:57,113
making birdhouses and a
checkerboard made of teak.

176
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,274
We're excited
to meet Cameron.

177
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,110
That whole family, though,
they had a reputation.

178
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:05,037
Ray, come on. RAY: But it's true.
It's a relevant factor.

179
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,322
Ray. Ray

180
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,124
Do you remember the one time
Lonnie punched that cop in the face?

181
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,200
- Ray.
- That was a...

182
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,500
Oh! Mother...

183
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:14,581
Oh, man! I got peanut butter
on my penis.

184
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:17,217
Ew, Dad.
Instant karma.

185
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,589
Cameron is a good guy.
He's nothing like that.

186
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,512
You're gonna see
when you meet him tonight.

187
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,682
They're all nice guys
until they get you pregnant,

188
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,059
and then you gotta drive
in their pickup trucks,

189
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,137
and you clean their guns,
and you got children,

190
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,564
and you clean guns, and you
like to get high with them,

191
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,731
and then y'all get fat.

192
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:33,854
Hey. Dad?

193
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,059
What?
Can you stop?

194
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,646
I gotta clean this
peanut butter off my hand.

195
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,196
Did you invite Grandmother
like you said you would?

196
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:52,703
About tonight. You said
that you'd invite her.

197
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:56,130
Oh. Right. I did.

198
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,627
You did?
Yeah.

199
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,630
I talked to her yesterday.

200
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,836
She's not gonna be able
to come, honey. I'm sorry.

201
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,047
Really?
Yeah.

202
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:07,221
Baby, she's agoraphobic.

203
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:11,267
She needs cognitive behavioral
therapy, so don't take it personally.

204
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,019
That's Vicky. I gotta go.

205
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,477
Hey, I love you.

206
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:19,604
Have a good day.

207
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:22,486
- Bye, Dad. Love you.
- Okay.

208
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:25,030
<i>- So, my mom's a liar.
- What happened?</i>

209
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:28,530
She said that she invited my
grandmother tonight, but she didn't.

210
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,456
I mean, she never
even contacted her.

211
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:33,034
How do you know?
Because I called her myself.

212
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,914
That's bullshit.
Yeah.

213
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,288
Dude, what's your mom's deal?
Why would she say that'?

214
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,708
I don't know. She just tries
to keep me away from her.

215
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:42,673
Everyone
in my family, like,

216
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:45,676
turns into a total nutcase
this time of year.

217
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,008
If I were you guys, I
wouldn't celebrate, either.

218
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,684
I would just put up
a Christmas tree instead.

219
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,434
Just skip all over the creepy
Halloween shit, right?

220
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,807
Does your grandma
ever talk about it?

221
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,267
Yeah, it's pretty much
all she talks about.

222
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,568
It defines her life.

223
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,105
She's been traumatized
ever since.

224
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,365
Wasn't it
her brother who, like,

225
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,613
cold-blooded murdilated
all those teenagers?

226
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:11,038
No. That's just a bit that some people
made up to make them feel better, I think.

227
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,040
I mean, that is scary to
have a bunch of your friends

228
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,083
get butchered by some
random crazy person.

229
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,628
Is it, though? Because,
all things considered,

230
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,831
there's a lot worse stuff
that's happening today.

231
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:22,383
And, like, I mean, what,
a couple people getting killed

232
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,462
by one guy with a knife
is not that big of a deal.

233
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,388
Dude, her grandmother
was almost fucking murdered.

234
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,636
And she escaped, and they caught
him, and now he's incarcerated.

235
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,308
I'm just saying, like,
by today's standards...

236
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,773
Just shut the fuck up,
Dave. Shut up.

237
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,226
Oh, I'm sorry.
Yeah, shut up, Dave.

238
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,945
Hey, is it cool with you guys if I
explode one of these pumpkin heads?

239
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,147
Yeah. Yeah.
Go for it.

240
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,315
Oh, he's serious?

241
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:48,693
He's serious. Oh, God,
he's really blowing it up.

242
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:49,777
I know. He's such
a fucking moron.

243
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:51,908
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, Jesus.

244
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,784
Go, go, go, go, go. Happy Halloween!

245
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,918
Ah!

246
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,997
Cameron. I got you.
That was a good one.

247
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,252
Yes, that was very good.

248
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:05,426
Hey, do you have everything for
your costume tomorrow night?

249
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,924
Bonnie and Clyde must
roll as one, after all.

250
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:09,927
Um, no, I mean, I'm more
focused on tonight.

251
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,258
Tonight?

252
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,602
I thought you were joking when you
said your parents were old-fashioned.

253
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:18,606
Be nice, okay?
Okay.

254
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:19,682
It'll be fun.

255
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,601
I'm excited for tonight.
I need to calm down.

256
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:24,062
I'm excited for tonight, okay?
Okay.

257
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,690
Ooh... Ugh!

258
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,571
Ugh. You guys
are just barf, you know.

259
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,448
You're just...
You're two yucky dumpsters,

260
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:33,446
and I want to go diving.
Come here. No.

261
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,871
Dude, dude.
Right here, right here, right?

262
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:38,034
Oh. Mwah. Mwah. Dude, you got
your little chapped-lip crusties

263
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,460
all over me, man,
so thanks.

264
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,253
I know.
And you're welcome.

265
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,589
It's gross. It's a little
part of me for you.

266
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,166
For the rest of your day.
All right?

267
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,418
So, do you have everything ready
for your costume tomorrow?

268
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:49,803
Um...

269
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,722
- About that...
- What?

270
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,137
Are we seriously not?

271
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,810
You said we were gonna do this
whole Halloween dance together,

272
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,888
and now you just ditch me.

273
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,349
I mean, you just... You can't walk
all over town breaking hearts.

274
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,275
Okay. Hey, listen, listen.
All right?

275
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:04,898
Love. Truly.
Okay, lovebirds, later.

276
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:11,026
Now let's open our books
to Frankl's interpretation.

277
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:16,407
He said, "Fate took
a different course.

278
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:21,707
"I understand how someone who
has nothing left in this world

279
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,087
"may still know bliss."

280
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,175
His message
is totally hopeful.

281
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:32,468
Even in the most disparaging of
conditions, life can find its meaning,

282
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,674
and conversely,
so can one's suffering.

283
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:38,227
I can't accept this.

284
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:41,856
Use it for whatever
your heart desires.

285
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,234
I'll save it
for college then.

286
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:49,484
Fuck college. Go somewhere.
Go to Mexico.

287
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,239
Could you imagine?

288
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,862
Yeah, I can.

289
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,622
Look, don't worry
about your mom.

290
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:01,993
She will freak,

291
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:04,708
but she'll get over it.

292
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:07,127
Why Can't you?

293
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:12,962
The Boogeyman?

294
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:17,801
All this hiding, all this
preparation, it was for nothing.

295
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:21,679
I mean, it took priority over your family.
It cost you your family.

296
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:26,230
If the way I raised your mother
means that she hates me,

297
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:33,028
but that she's prepared
for the horrors of this world,

298
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,159
then I can live with that.

299
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,788
Say goodbye to Michael,
and get over it.

300
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:46,495
Goodbye.

301
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:23,833
<i>Dr. Samuel
Loomis, January 22, 1979.</i>

302
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:28,087
<i>Do you wish to give a statement regarding
your former patient, Michael Myers?</i>

303
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:30,919
<i>My suggestion
is termination.</i>

304
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,425
<i>Death is the only solution
for Michael.</i>

305
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,128
A2201. Myers, Michael.

306
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:40,638
<i>There's nothing to be
gained from keeping evil alive.</i>

307
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,093
A22...

308
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:48,228
<i>A shot of sodium thiopental
would render him unconscious.</i>

309
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:53,316
<i>I'll be with him to make sure
his life is extinguished.</i>

310
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:59,535
<i>My ear on his chest to hear for myself
that his vitals no longer function,</i>

311
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,867
<i>and immediately
incinerate the body.</i>

312
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:05,199
<i>It needs to die.</i>

313
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:07,409
<i>It needs to die!</i>

314
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:26,020
<i>It needs to die!</i>

315
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:32,727
Don't worry, Michael.
I'll be by your side.

316
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:46,874
Michael Myers is still my patient
until he's in somebody else's care,

317
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,664
so I'm seeing my duty
through till the end.

318
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,295
All right, move out.

319
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,531
...send my DNA away
to a stranger.

320
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:21,484
Why not? You can find out
some pretty interesting things.

321
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:23,031
Don't... I found out
that I'm part Cherokee.

322
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,283
I guess my dad's,
like, 7% Cherokee.

323
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,410
I know Lonnie. I went to
high school with him.

324
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:28,706
- He used to sell me peyote.
- Dad.

325
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,326
- Everyone knows Lonnie.
- Yeah.

326
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:31,995
Dad.
I'm sorry.

327
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:34,376
Um, this is a massive
overshare for our new friend.

328
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:37,709
No, he did. I learned a lot
about myself with his dad.

329
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,468
Tripped balls out in the
woods, me and his dad.

330
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:40,885
Boy, Ray...
Tripping balls.

331
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:43,764
No, really, keep talking.

332
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,217
So, you guys have big plans for
tomorrow at the high school?

333
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,301
What are you doing?

334
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:48,681
- Is it a dance or something?
- Yeah, it's a Halloween...

335
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:49,887
Costumes? CAMERON: Halloween dance.
Yep.

336
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,018
Costume party.
What are you going as?

337
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,896
Uh, well, I don't know
if I'm allowed to say.

338
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:56,231
- Please say.
- Oh, come on.

339
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,311
- I can... Okay.
- Come on.

340
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,613
So we're going
as Bonnie and Clyde.

341
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,315
- Oh, that's a great idea.
- Yeah.

342
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:02,365
Except...
Oh!

343
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:04,326
Ooh. Oh. No. Okay,
so just Bonnie and Clyde.

344
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,445
- That's it. Bonnie and Clyde.
- Bonnie and Clyde with a twist.

345
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,821
- Classic.
- Yeah!

346
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:09,031
I love that.
Nice.

347
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,240
That's so fun.
You'll see.

348
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:11,450
You know how
it ended, right?

349
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,168
- Their story ended a little...
- Yes. Hopefully...

350
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,495
Yes, with the bullets
and the bleeding.

351
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:15,829
Yeah.

352
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:18,211
You have a jalopy filled
with bullet holes from the G-men?

353
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:19,541
I wish
we had one of those.

354
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,093
- It was in Laughlin, like a Model A.
- I know.

355
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,215
Did you talk to Grandmother?

356
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:26,639
Yeah.

357
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:30,853
She said she was gonna come. She came
to my office. We had a nice talk.

358
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,350
Did you? Really?

359
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,101
That's a first.
It was nice.

360
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:35,725
Do you know
where she is then?

361
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:38,778
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I... That part... Oh.

362
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,320
- Great timing, Mom. Hi.
- I...

363
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:41,613
You made it.
It ran late. I'm sorry.

364
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:42,690
Hi. I'm so happy you came.
Hi, Mom.

365
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:43,774
Hi, Laurie.

366
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,450
- Hi. Hi. I'm, uh...
- Hi.

367
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:46,743
I'm the grandmother.

368
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,696
Nice to meet you.
I'm Cameron Elam.

369
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,827
And we're here celebrating our
daughter because of her...

370
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,874
Yes, I know.
How did it go?

371
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:57,084
Yes. It looks good on you. You Know,
I was in the Honor Society, too.

372
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:58,338
That's good. Why don't you
sit down, Mom?

373
00:24:58,414 --> 00:24:59,506
No, I'm good.
Yeah, have a seat.

374
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:00,924
Or we could go for a walk,
if you'd like.

375
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,047
Really? Did it go great?
Yeah? Yeah.

376
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:03,127
It went really...
It went, um...

377
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,553
- Hey, Mom?
- That's mine.

378
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,921
I thought
you quit drinking.

379
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,131
Mmm!

380
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,341
Mom, what are you doing?
What is this?

381
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:13,183
You know, this is exactly
why we don't reach out.

382
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:14,388
Mom.

383
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:18,021
I'm sorry.
I will sit down.

384
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:19,309
Okay.

385
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:23,652
Why don't we press the reset button?
Why don't we just start over, okay'?

386
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:26,442
All right, Mom...

387
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,531
- Sorry.
- Morn.

388
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,782
Please stop this.

389
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:35,701
Sorry.

390
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,204
I saw him.

391
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,002
The Shape.

392
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,129
Mom...
I wanted to kill him.

393
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,710
Okay,
that's enough, Laurie.

394
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,803
Laurie, that's enough.
I didn't know what to do.

395
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:48,722
- That's enough, Laurie.
- Okay.

396
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,266
I think maybe this is a little
bit too much for you, huh?

397
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,809
Why don't we go
for a walk, all right?

398
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:54,679
You said you were gonna try
to put the past behind you.

399
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:55,763
Laurie.

400
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:58,858
Okay? Are you gonna try to do that?
That's what you said you wanted to do.

401
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:02,653
I can't. Mom, look at me.
Look at me.

402
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:08,363
Should we, uh...

403
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:11,829
Really hate to say
I told you so, but...

404
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,649
I'm glad you got
to see that.

405
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,662
I never told you
how I spent my childhood.

406
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,033
Gotcha.

407
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,536
I learned how to shoot a gun
when I was eight.

408
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:02,747
I learned how to fight.

409
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,708
I had nightmares
about the basement.

410
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:13,800
Social Services came when I was
12 years old and took me away.

411
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:21,978
I've spent my entire life
trying to get over the paranoia

412
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,560
and neuroses that she has
projected on me.

413
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,320
Yeah, he reminds
me of, uh, Gary Hogeboom.

414
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,277
Yeah, that quarterback
thing is all messed up.

415
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:31,324
Good times, right?

416
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,280
What is she gonna do
with herself?

417
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,536
I know. It's not
your job to save her.

418
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,332
She'll be all right.

419
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,792
I can't get reception
on this thing

420
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:50,844
ever since the antenna
was bent at the car wash.

421
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:53,468
Why do we have to come out again?
We do this all the time.

422
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,634
What? You don't enjoy it? I like
being out in the woods and...

423
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:59,721
No, I enjoy it, but I'm
missing dance class for this.

424
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:01,805
And sometimes I would rather
do that than hunting.

425
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:04,392
I mean, is dance class
that important to you?

426
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:05,851
Yeah, it is.
You need some more time

427
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,151
in the woods to go
hunting and fishing. No.

428
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,649
On weekends,
I'll do it with you, Dad.

429
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,322
Like, I really love
spending time with you,

430
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:12,320
but right now dancing
is my thing, you know,

431
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,867
and it really hits me
in the heart. I mean, I...

432
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,110
Dad, look out!
Oh!

433
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,250
What the hell
happened to you, hoss?

434
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:23,956
Oh, shit.

435
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,414
Dad, look.

436
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:29,257
Lumpy, you stay here.

437
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,963
I'm gonna make sure
no one's hurt.

438
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,045
You call the police.
Okay.

439
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:35,256
Dad, be careful, please.

440
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:37,595
Hey, you fellas okay?

441
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:41,516
You all right?

442
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,233
<i>911.
What is the emergency?</i>

443
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:57,661
Yes. Um, there's
been an accident.

444
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:02,366
Uh, there's a bus. People
running around in the road.

445
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:04,581
My dad went to look.
I don't know.

446
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:06,795
Okay. Hold on.

447
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:08,872
I'll go check.

448
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:27,849
Dad?

449
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:12,940
Run.

450
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:17,904
Wait here.
I'll go get my dad.

451
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:20,110
Run!

452
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:22,904
Dad!

453
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,243
Daddy!

454
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:44,718
Don't shoot. Aah!

455
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:46,812
Oh, fuck!
Fuck!

456
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:18,961
"Don't need a credit carol
to ride this train."

457
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:22,881
Yo, Hawk, listen.
The ball come down loose,

458
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,966
that's where you're gonna mess up at.
Yo, Hawkins, would you like

459
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,144
a strawberry slushie
or a blue raspberry slushie?

460
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,680
Can you just bring me a coffee, will you?
I'll get you back later.

461
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:32,061
Pull a slingshot, it'll go
straight down the middle.

462
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,734
But you ain't never gonna beat my score,
so it makes no difference what you do.

463
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:35,982
Say that again.

464
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,608
You're never gonna beat my score, so it
doesn't make no difference what you do.

465
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:40,657
<i>Dispatch to unit 601.
We have a 10-50 on Marlow Road.</i>

466
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:42,909
Copy that, dispatch.
I'm on my way.

467
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,122
<i>Attention, all units.
We got an officer that's 10-23</i>

468
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:57,708
<i>and a possible 10-50
on Route 20. Will advise.</i>

469
00:31:58,125 --> 00:31:59,547
Sheriff's Department.

470
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,841
<i>Possible 10-98. Over.</i>

471
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,423
If you need assistance,
let yourself be known.

472
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:07,513
Signal 13.

473
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:09,265
Officer down.

474
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,064
I repeat, officer down.

475
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,603
I need assistance.
Send backup right away.

476
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:23,909
<i>Uh, roger that. 10-1, officer down.
Sending EMT and all available units.</i>

477
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,160
Ooh!

478
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:38,756
Show your hands!

479
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:43,254
I've been shot.

480
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:46,510
All right, stay with me.
Help's on the way.

481
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,300
What happened in here?

482
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:51,433
Did he escape?

483
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,062
Who?

484
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:54,807
Did who escape?

485
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:03,316
Well, I got a cousin works
at a graveyard not too far from here.

486
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:09,079
They got war generals,
philanthropists, a beatnik poet.

487
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:10,826
They got Muddy Waters.

488
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:12,499
Oh, and they got Bernie Mac.

489
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:14,793
People come from all over
to pay respects.

490
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:19,794
But this is Haddonfield, and
this is our only claim to fame.

491
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:23,753
Maybe you can explain to me what's
so special about Judith Myers.

492
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:29,432
As she sat combing
her hair, unaware,

493
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:32,933
her 6-year-old brother crept in
quietly with a kitchen knife.

494
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:37,895
He then proceeded to
slice the base of her skull,

495
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:40,732
scraping her spinal cord.

496
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:45,324
<i>When she turned, raising
her hands in self-defense,</i>

497
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,155
<i>he continued stabbing</i>

498
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:51,538
<i>into the nerves and arteries
of her palms.</i>

499
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:58,166
Three more stabs into her
sternum, penetrating her heart.

500
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:08,880
Hawkins.

501
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:14,511
Still checking IDs
of the patients we recovered

502
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:15,937
to figure out who's who.

503
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,015
Almost all accounted for.

504
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:20,351
Two of them were checking their
emails at a local library.

505
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:22,436
Just found three of them
holding hands,

506
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:25,489
chasing butterflies
at a flea market off the 220.

507
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:29,493
Butterflies? Still no idea
what really went clown.

508
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,370
Any word from Mr. Rip
Van Winkle over here?

509
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,081
Nurses say he's been in
and out, lost a lot of blood.

510
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:37,205
Somehow managed
to fall on a bullet.

511
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:40,003
I'm trying to get the whole story
because here's my concern.

512
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,584
Take a look at this list.

513
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:46,418
Most of them minor
offenders, mental patients.

514
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:49,134
One stuck out. A2201.

515
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:50,680
It's Michael Myers.

516
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:53,767
Babysitter Murders, 1978.

517
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:57,642
Forty years to this day.

518
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:01,316
Michael Myers loose
with a bunch of nutbags

519
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:03,359
in Haddonfield
on Halloween night?

520
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:06,237
We're gonna have a fucking
circus on our hands.

521
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:08,732
But hey.

522
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,323
What are we gonna do?
Cancel Halloween?

523
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,615
<i>WOMAN". Dr. Ray,
please pick up line two.</i>

524
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,433
I need to go to a number
two almost immediately.

525
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:38,519
Can I drive? Come
on, get in the car. Move it.

526
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,949
Want anything from the shop?
No. No, thank you.

527
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,297
Hmm.

528
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,513
Where's the loo?
Excuse me?

529
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:14,589
Bathroom.

530
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,053
It's out that way,
around the back.

531
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,390
Excuse me. Sorry.
Someone's in here.

532
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:58,777
Hello?

533
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:45,907
What the...

534
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,045
Help me!

535
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:01,764
Help me!

536
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,341
Aaron!

537
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,641
Get off me!

538
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:18,114
Aaron! Stop!

539
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:19,941
Help me!

540
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:28,242
Michael.
Aaron! Aaron!

541
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:47,097
Dana! No!

542
00:39:58,271 --> 00:39:59,318
Dana!

543
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:54,251
<i>Police have not
determined a cause of this accident.</i>

544
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,921
<i>This scene's still
very active, of course.</i>

545
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,919
<i>You can see the police tape
set up behind me.</i>

546
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:01,501
<i>That prison bus firmly down
in that ditch.</i>

547
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:06,048
<i>You can see the tow truck, of course, that
is trying to get that prison bus out.</i>

548
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,970
<i>A source tells us that bus</i>

549
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:10,973
<i>was transporting personnel
from a local state hospital.</i>

550
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,316
13 A-9.

551
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,145
Roger.

552
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:14,907
Ray?

553
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:22,256
Allyson?

554
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:27,633
Allyson? Is anyone home?

555
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:39,307
Karen?
Shh.

556
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:42,310
What?

557
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,229
Gotcha!

558
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,355
<i>Jesus.</i>

559
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:48,487
You're dead.
You scared me!

560
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,701
What are you doing
in our house?

561
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:52,245
You mean, how did I get
into your house?

562
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,701
You have no security
system, Karen.

563
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:56,875
Your side window
was wide open.

564
00:42:56,949 --> 00:43:00,749
Sometimes I can't tell the difference
between your stupidity and your ignorance.

565
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:02,163
Hey, Laurie,
this is my home,

566
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,374
and I can take care
of my own family, all right?

567
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:05,754
I know jujitsu.
I have studied...

568
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,001
- The bus crashed.
- Ray.

569
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:08,628
What?
Look, I have a plan.

570
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:10,797
Where's Allyson? We need
to get out of here now.

571
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:13,432
What bus crashed?

572
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:15,806
Put down that gun. Put down...
Hey, hey. Back off!

573
00:43:15,885 --> 00:43:17,887
Put down that gun. You're in my...
Put down the gun!

574
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:20,314
Mom, you need help,

575
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:22,858
and you are not welcome in
this house until you get it.

576
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:25,232
I have tried to protect you
and prepare you.

577
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,984
Now we have to hunt him down.

578
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:30,283
Yeah, and I am trying to
prepare dinner for my family.

579
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,493
The world is not
a dark and evil place.

580
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,995
It is full of love
and understanding,

581
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:37,665
and I'm not letting your
psychotic rants confuse me

582
00:43:37,824 --> 00:43:39,167
or convince me otherwise.

583
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:42,245
Keep the gun.
No! You need to go.

584
00:43:42,662 --> 00:43:43,663
Get out!

585
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:53,472
Son of a bitch.

586
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:08,817
Hawkins.

587
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:10,648
Frank!

588
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:13,868
Yeah?
Look at this.

589
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:19,165
It's a hospital gown.
State-issued.

590
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,743
Get on the phone to Smith's Grove.
Confirm the match.

591
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:24,412
You know I was there
that night.

592
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:26,497
I was there.

593
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,710
We have one order of business.

594
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:33,676
That's to hunt
this thing down.

595
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:40,686
There's a reason we're supposed
to be afraid of this night.

596
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:43,268
Trick or treat!

597
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:55,990
- Which one should we go to?
- They're all spooky.

598
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,947
I'm gonna pick that one
over across the street.

599
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:01,078
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

600
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,164
What the... Sorry.
Hey. Sorry about that.

601
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:09,340
Black cats and
goblins and broomsticks and ghosts.

602
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:12,961
Covens of witches
with all of their hosts.

603
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:15,387
You may think they scare me.

604
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:17,340
You're probably right.

605
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:20,973
Black cats and goblins
on Halloween night.

606
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:39,779
<i>Please!</i>

607
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:41,405
<i>Please let us out of here!</i>

608
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:06,097
...the <i>other side.</i>

609
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:08,982
<i>You are the sign.</i>

610
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:40,760
- Trick or treat!
- Hey, guys. Stay together.

611
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:44,094
Very scary.

612
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:51,935
Trick or treat, smell my
feet, give me something good to eat.

613
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:53,019
Wait, hang on, hang on.

614
00:46:53,102 --> 00:46:54,649
- I don't have my stethoscope.
- Come on!

615
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:56,106
I need it. I'm gonna get it.
We're going to be late.

616
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:57,565
I'll be right back.
Jeez!

617
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:09,786
Look. You're not gonna believe this.
They were in my pocket the whole time.

618
00:47:10,036 --> 00:47:11,253
Did Rebecca
give you directions?

619
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:12,876
Yeah. She did call me.

620
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,679
Hey, Sally.
How are you?

621
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:27,724
Really?

622
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,521
That's awful.

623
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:37,696
Well, I'll keep
my doors locked.

624
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:41,735
Thanks for telling me.

625
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:46,284
Billy's still out
at a party.

626
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,543
Let me know if you hear
anything else.

627
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:01,674
Good night, Sally.

628
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,154
Trick or treat!

629
00:48:27,196 --> 00:48:30,200
Bonnie and Clyde, you are lady-killers.
You guys are seriously beautiful.

630
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:31,283
You're seriously...
Give me a smile.

631
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:32,789
Give me a big smile.
Just hold her tight.

632
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:35,212
There we go. Do that. Do
that with your ass.

633
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:03,445
Okay, so, no, not... It's Vicky.
One second. One sec.

634
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:07,370
Okay, you don't have
to take it.

635
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:12,875
Hi. Oh, my gosh,
I wish that you were here.

636
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,122
It is so much fun.

637
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:17,000
God, I wish I was there.
I'm so fucking bummed.

638
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,376
<i>It's just, like,
so much easier</i>

639
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:20,629
to actually, like, talk to
people when you have no idea

640
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:23,002
<i>who they are. Yeah, dude, I
told you you'd have fun.</i>

641
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:26,548
How's Cameron? Is he looking super
fine in my grandma's skirt?

642
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:30,601
He is so sexy, it's a
little too much to take.

643
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:31,969
But...

644
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:36,728
<i>Where'd you go?
No, he's so sweet.</i>

645
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,059
I'm having the best time.

646
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:39,689
You know, you guys should just
come over here when it's done.

647
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:41,691
Dave's already on his way,
and he's gonna bring the, uh,

648
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:44,444
you know, the "Alakazam,"
if you know what I mean.

649
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,409
And Julian's parents aren't gonna
be back until, like, super late.

650
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:52,202
Okay, well, it is a school night, so
we're not gonna "kazam" too much.

651
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:55,952
Oh, come on. It's a "school night."
Don't be a needy bitch. Get over here.

652
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:58,455
Okay. I'll see you soon. We'll
come over as soon as it's over.

653
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,081
Okay, bye. Love you.

654
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:01,666
I heard you telling your
friends to come over here

655
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:04,047
and you're gonna smoke some weed.
No. No.

656
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:05,169
That "Alakazam"?

657
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:08,347
Julian, I'm talking about, like,
you know, like, a magic trick,

658
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:09,674
like, "abracadabra."
Mmm.

659
00:50:09,924 --> 00:50:11,972
I know you're talking about
smoking weed. Don't lie to me.

660
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:14,136
That's against the rules.
I'm telling my mom.

661
00:50:14,303 --> 00:50:16,101
Well, I'm gonna tell your mom
about your browser history.

662
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:17,348
You better not.

663
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:19,308
You can get me in trouble,
I can get you in trouble.

664
00:50:20,226 --> 00:50:21,227
I'm...

665
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:22,732
You used to be my favorite,
but now you're,

666
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:24,905
like, my tenth favorite boy
that I nanny.

667
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,195
And I babysit
some fucking loser kids.

668
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:31,078
If I had some other kind of babysitter,
she'd be reading me a story.

669
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:34,453
I wouldn't be up clipping
my nasty-ass toenails.

670
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:36,909
Uh-huh. Go to bed.
You used to be cool.

671
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:39,040
We used to be friends.
But now...

672
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:42,206
Okay.
Come on, go to bed.

673
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:43,632
Wait.
It's way past your bedtime.

674
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:44,959
You want to be a good kid?
Mmm-hmm.

675
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:46,920
Go to bed, go to bed.
How much do you get paid?

676
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:48,219
Come on, let's go, let's go.

677
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:50,302
I'll get ya. Come on.

678
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:54,134
Good night, little dude.

679
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:59,974
Hey, Vicky. Can you leave
the door open'? Just a crack?

680
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,058
Yeah.

681
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:03,693
Good night.

682
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:09,317
By the way, you're actually
my favorite kid I babysit for.

683
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:11,701
I like you, too.

684
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:14,071
Good night.

685
00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:12,421
That is not what...

686
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,429
Fuck.
Okay, that really...

687
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:19,220
That fucked me up. Okay.

688
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:24,938
Allyson!
Allyson, come here!

689
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:29,605
Wait. Hey, Allyson.
No. What was that?

690
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:32,901
Okay. What?
What was that? What's this?

691
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:36,411
What? Dude, have some
discretion, all right'?

692
00:52:37,196 --> 00:52:41,872
I don't know what you thought you saw,
but Kim literally was talking to me.

693
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,336
Really? She came up
to me and, like,

694
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:46,539
whispered in my ear, okay? You
don't have to cry about it.

695
00:52:46,622 --> 00:52:47,999
It's not that big a deal.

696
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:50,335
So Oscar got you fucked up?
No, I got...

697
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:52,260
I mean, I got
me fucked up. I...

698
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:54,588
Okay.

699
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:57,724
Hey, okay, can we just talk?
Okay. Don't.

700
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,263
Okay,
here, you know what? No.

701
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:00,969
Your fucking precious phone?

702
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,773
What the fuck?
You gonna get that?

703
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:10,446
Or do you want me
to get it?

704
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:22,537
Hold up, hold up.
Wait, wait, wait.

705
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:23,617
I'm done.

706
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:28,379
<i>This is Unit 14.</i>

707
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:30,128
<i>I'm out by
Old Lady Miller's house.</i>

708
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:32,130
<i>I don't see anything
suspicious out here. Over.</i>

709
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:35,550
<i>Uh, 10-4. You want to go
ahead and show yourself code two,</i>

710
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,427
<i>officially cancel request
for assistance?</i>

711
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:40,343
<i>Uh, affirmative. Over.</i>

712
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:14,426
Oh, shit.

713
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:15,502
Sorry.
Hi.

714
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:17,179
I didn't want to ring the
doorbell and wake up the kid.

715
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:19,048
It's okay. Check it out.
Fresh from my patch.

716
00:54:19,131 --> 00:54:20,257
Oh, my God.
His eyes are hearts.

717
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,512
I love it.
Yeah.

718
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:23,390
This is Tate.
Hello. Hi, Tate.

719
00:54:23,469 --> 00:54:25,096
Hello. What's up?
Hi. How are ya?

720
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:26,351
Do we have
the whole house to ourselves?

721
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:27,727
Is that how this works?
Yes.

722
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:30,271
Sweet. Until Allyson
and Cameron get here.

723
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:33,901
Okay, so, in the meantime,
you want to make some popcorn

724
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:35,151
and watch a spooky movie?

725
00:54:35,481 --> 00:54:37,609
Mmm, no. All right,
wait, check this out.

726
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:38,863
You're gonna like this.

727
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:45,078
I went and got this tattoo.

728
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:47,789
Because tonight
is the night,

729
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:50,000
the one we'll remember
for the rest of our lives.

730
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,247
You are so getting
dry-fucked tonight.

731
00:54:52,331 --> 00:54:55,005
Oh, yeah?
Fucking come here.

732
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:07,225
What?

733
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:09,727
What was that?
What was what?

734
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:11,691
Did you hear something?

735
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:14,186
No. What was it?

736
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:17,777
I don't know. I thought I heard,
like, a noise or something.

737
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:20,992
Yeah, it's probably just
Julian taking a dump.

738
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:23,036
Would you go look?

739
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:25,079
Do I have to?

740
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:26,582
Yeah, would you
please go look?

741
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:27,699
Okay.

742
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:30,327
It was weird.
All right.

743
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,584
All right, little buddy.

744
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:39,211
Oh, fuck me.

745
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:41,217
I saw someone in the hallway,
standing outside my door.

746
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:42,635
Oh.
What's up, buddy?

747
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:45,600
There was a fucked-up face,
watching me from the dark.

748
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:47,223
Ghosts and goblins,
little buddy?

749
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:50,101
Shut up, Dave! I heard him
breathing, and then I saw him.

750
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,057
He's in here.
Boogeyman's in this house.

751
00:55:52,558 --> 00:55:54,310
Okay. All right.
Come on, I got you.

752
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,062
Let's check it out.
Send Dave first.

753
00:55:57,938 --> 00:55:59,531
No, it's fine. It's fine.
No, no. No, it's not.

754
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:01,153
It's okay. Come on.
No, it's not.

755
00:56:01,233 --> 00:56:02,530
Come on, show me where
you saw Boogeyman.

756
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,327
I'll protect you. I'm strong.
I got you. No.

757
00:56:04,403 --> 00:56:05,575
Vicky, you go up there first.
I'll fight him off.

758
00:56:05,654 --> 00:56:06,701
Come on. I promise.
No.

759
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,325
- Can you call my mom?
- Yeah.

760
00:56:09,408 --> 00:56:11,001
If there's something
in the room, I'll call her.

761
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:13,204
He was standing
right there in the door.

762
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:15,038
I'll check it out.

763
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:27,142
Excuse me, sir.
What are you doing in here?

764
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:30,103
Please, you need to leave.

765
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:32,180
Please leave.

766
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:34,766
Vicky?

767
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:36,602
Get out now!

768
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:41,690
Gotcha.
You fucking kidding me?

769
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:44,526
You're safe.
Nothing's in here.

770
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:45,944
You're sure?
Mmm-hmm.

771
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:49,998
You checked
behind the curtains?

772
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,791
I checked the whole place.

773
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:32,699
Sick.

774
00:57:34,076 --> 00:57:37,421
See? There's nothing to be afraid
of. There's no Boogeyman in here.

775
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:39,047
What if it's a doll?

776
00:57:39,915 --> 00:57:42,794
Ooh, it could be, like, one of
those weird, like, kid dolls,

777
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:44,719
one of those weird babies,
and they stare at you

778
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:46,679
with those beady little eyes.

779
00:58:01,395 --> 00:58:02,396
Oh, fuck.

780
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:05,782
Ah, Sharia.

781
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:11,948
Could you close
the closet door?

782
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:13,615
Yeah.

783
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:28,964
Oh, shit!

784
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:32,509
on, God.

785
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:34,219
No!

786
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:35,937
On!

787
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:46,027
Help! Dave! Help me!

788
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:47,274
Vicky!

789
00:58:49,568 --> 00:58:51,161
Whoa!

790
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,075
Julian, run!

791
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:55,832
I'll go get help. Dave!
Dave! Vicky?

792
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:57,576
Get out of here!

793
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:01,375
Don't go up there!
You're gonna get killed, Dave.

794
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:02,873
Somebody help me!

795
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:04,048
Dave, help me!
Vicky.

796
00:59:04,124 --> 00:59:07,173
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

797
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:09,421
No! No!

798
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:12,800
Fuck this.

799
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:20,185
<i>All units, we have reports</i>

800
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:22,609
<i>of a domestic disturbance
at 707 Meridian Avenue.</i>

801
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:23,940
<i>Please respond. Over.</i>

802
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:25,228
Copy that, Dispatch.

803
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:32,452
Okay, guys, don't
forget to say thank you.

804
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:48,377
Come on.
That's enough. No, come on.

805
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:50,053
No, they can have
a little more, honey.

806
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:10,738
Trick or treat, smell
my feet, give me something good to eat.

807
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,377
Haddonfield
Sheriff's Department!

808
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:33,968
Responding to
a domestic disturbance!

809
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:47,940
I repeat. This is Officer
Hawkins. Please respond.

810
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:11,172
Get out of here! Now!

811
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:12,586
Let's go, guys. Move.

812
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:13,670
Get inside!

813
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:09,684
Oh, fuck!

814
01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:30,497
Michael!

815
01:02:44,552 --> 01:02:45,553
Oh, shit.

816
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:12,004
Laurie. Fuck!
Jesus Christ, Frank!

817
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:13,548
Fuck me!
What the fuck?

818
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:17,381
What the hell
are you doing here?

819
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:18,882
Frank, he's here.

820
01:03:20,255 --> 01:03:21,256
I know.

821
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:34,770
This way, please.

822
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:46,656
Look who's up.

823
01:03:48,867 --> 01:03:49,868
Where is he?

824
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:53,330
You tell me.

825
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:00,261
<i>The bus
lost control after Michael</i>

826
01:04:00,337 --> 01:04:02,214
overtook the first guard
and the driver.

827
01:04:02,464 --> 01:04:03,761
He's no longer dormant.

828
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:07,219
He only knows how to keep
moving and to keep killing.

829
01:04:07,469 --> 01:04:09,597
And he will kill again
unless he's captured.

830
01:04:11,598 --> 01:04:12,850
Come with me
for a minute.

831
01:04:13,475 --> 01:04:14,522
You sit still.

832
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:17,737
Well, I was sitting still
anyway. What do you mean?

833
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:18,813
He's an asset.

834
01:04:19,064 --> 01:04:22,318
He's not an asset. He's a liability.
No, no. He's on this hunt.

835
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:24,987
Nobody knows Myers
better than he does.

836
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:26,322
Oh, thank you.

837
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:28,953
You want me to take this
injured civilian to go look for

838
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:31,126
- a psychopathic serial killer?
- Sheriff.

839
01:04:31,326 --> 01:04:32,873
Frank. What are we doing?

840
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:34,295
We don't need your help
right now, Laurie.

841
01:04:34,371 --> 01:04:36,999
You're just standing here!
Please do something!

842
01:04:37,082 --> 01:04:38,174
Excuse me, Officers.

843
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:41,253
Laurie Strode.

844
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:47,767
Laurie Strode,
meet Dr. Sartain.

845
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:52,271
I'm Michael's doctor.
Ranbir Sartain.

846
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:54,808
Oh, you're the new Loomis.

847
01:04:57,477 --> 01:04:59,400
I read everything
about you and Michael.

848
01:05:02,941 --> 01:05:03,942
Everything.

849
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:07,655
Did you know
our friend Hawkins here

850
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:12,076
was the first responding deputy when
Michael was apprehended in 1978?

851
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:15,920
He stopped Loomis from
killing Michael that night.

852
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:22,091
Do you know that I pray every
night that he would escape?

853
01:05:22,836 --> 01:05:24,634
What the hell
do you do that for?

854
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:26,715
So I can kill him.

855
01:05:27,674 --> 01:05:29,392
Well, that was
a dumb thing to pray for.

856
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:39,769
I'm sure he'll apologize.
He just needs to sleep it off.

857
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:41,862
Cameron doesn't want anyone
to see him <i>as</i> a bad guy,

858
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,782
but then he gets drunk
and gets belligerent

859
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:46,235
and looks like an idiot.

860
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:50,368
And then I look like
an idiot for vouching for him.

861
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:56,332
I'm really tired of everybody
letting me down all the time.

862
01:05:58,538 --> 01:05:59,585
You deserve better.

863
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:02,375
I mean...

864
01:06:03,251 --> 01:06:05,174
Allyson, you're the
coolest, you're the prettiest,

865
01:06:05,253 --> 01:06:06,721
and you're the nicest girl
in school.

866
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:09,640
And if anyone doesn't appreciate
that, they're a crazy person.

867
01:06:11,259 --> 01:06:13,603
Thank you.
That's very sweet.

868
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:18,933
Let's get out of here.

869
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:20,768
I know a shortcut.

870
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:25,153
From a clinical perspective, Doctor,
would you say that Laurie Strode

871
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:26,983
has lost
her fucking marbles?

872
01:06:27,066 --> 01:06:30,366
There are many ways for tragedy
and violence to change a victim.

873
01:06:31,571 --> 01:06:34,324
They can grow accustomed
to always being afraid,

874
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:35,875
in constant fear.

875
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:39,413
They can grow weak,
they can grow strong.

876
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:41,623
But there's also
the other side.

877
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:43,208
What other side is that?

878
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:45,293
The effect
on the victimizer.

879
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:49,840
You see, this is what has
intrigued me through my studies.

880
01:06:50,632 --> 01:06:53,431
How does a crime
like Michael's affect him?

881
01:06:54,219 --> 01:06:55,220
Mmm-hmm.

882
01:06:56,054 --> 01:06:57,055
What's that feeling?

883
01:06:57,764 --> 01:07:01,143
Is he on a random path,
or is he emotionally driven?

884
01:07:01,226 --> 01:07:02,523
Triggered by something?

885
01:07:03,144 --> 01:07:07,194
Perhaps some unheard marching order
imprinted on his very being.

886
01:07:08,191 --> 01:07:09,989
I want to know
what he's feeling.

887
01:07:10,068 --> 01:07:13,368
I want to know what pleasure
he gets out of killing.

888
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:15,748
Where is this killer?
We gotta find him.

889
01:07:15,949 --> 01:07:18,418
I'm not gonna stand in the
way of justice this time.

890
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:20,412
Remember, he's property
of the state.

891
01:07:20,495 --> 01:07:22,839
He mustn't be harmed.
Oh, yeah?

892
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:24,332
We'll see about that.

893
01:07:54,988 --> 01:07:56,331
It's not safe here.

894
01:07:58,032 --> 01:08:00,455
Where's Allyson?
Where is she?

895
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:01,915
Where's Allyson?

896
01:08:02,453 --> 01:08:03,454
Honey, it's Mom.

897
01:08:03,538 --> 01:08:05,711
Can you please call me back the
second that you get this, please?

898
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:07,463
The police said that
they evacuated the dance,

899
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:08,885
and I can't get
in touch with you.

900
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,587
And they're making us go
to your grandmother's house

901
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:11,887
because it's safe...

902
01:08:11,963 --> 01:08:13,556
Sweetheart, this is
your grandmother.

903
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:17,723
There is a police officer waiting
at your house to bring you to us.

904
01:08:17,802 --> 01:08:19,054
We're all gonna be together.

905
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:21,773
Now, do <i>as</i> I say.

906
01:08:22,265 --> 01:08:23,983
Oh, shit.

907
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:25,275
It's treacherous
<i>as</i> hell here.

908
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:26,728
Okay.
You good?

909
01:08:27,395 --> 01:08:28,396
Take my hand.
Okay.

910
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:30,565
Right here. This is the
dumbest shortcut ever.

911
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:32,321
Watch out for
all the poison ivy.

912
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:34,361
Don't let me fall on that.
All right. I got you.

913
01:08:34,444 --> 01:08:35,696
I got you. Okay, I got you.
Okay, go.

914
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:38,956
Okay. You did it. Yay.

915
01:08:39,032 --> 01:08:40,500
Good job.
Yay.

916
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:42,368
What are you doing?

917
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:44,546
I mean, you deserve better.

918
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:45,873
Right? I mean...

919
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:49,049
What the fuck?
What?

920
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:51,173
You're not with Cameron anymore.
That does not...

921
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:53,800
That does not mean
I want to be with you.

922
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:56,133
I thought you were
sending me signals.

923
01:08:56,549 --> 01:08:58,597
Definitely no signals.
I'm so sorry.

924
01:08:58,676 --> 01:09:00,144
Please, you cannot
tell Cameron about this.

925
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:01,892
I didn't feel anything,
either. I swear.

926
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:03,973
I didn't... Wait, I didn't...
You are so pathetic.

927
01:09:04,057 --> 01:09:06,651
I'm going home. You can
figure your own shit out.

928
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:09,399
Who's there? What... Hey!

929
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:11,447
Motion sensor, dumb-ass!

930
01:09:13,775 --> 01:09:17,325
Allyson, I'm, like, really
drunk right now. Seriously.

931
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:19,656
I got really horny
at the party, and, like,

932
01:09:19,864 --> 01:09:22,492
all these girls were,
like, dancing on me.

933
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:25,124
Their beautiful bodies got me
all chubbed out, Allyson.

934
01:09:25,203 --> 01:09:26,750
I... Allyson, please!

935
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:29,252
They, like... They were
feeding me guacamole

936
01:09:29,624 --> 01:09:31,001
in all these sexy ways.

937
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:33,920
It's not my...

938
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:46,562
Happy Halloween,
Mr. Elrod. I'm just...

939
01:09:46,641 --> 01:09:48,143
I don't know, man.
I'm sorry.

940
01:09:48,226 --> 01:09:50,524
I'm not trying to trespass
on your yard and shit, man.

941
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:54,233
I was just trying to take a shortcut
with a really pretty girl, and I just...

942
01:09:54,315 --> 01:09:55,942
I just
really like her, man,

943
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:57,902
and I thought
that she liked me, too.

944
01:09:57,985 --> 01:09:59,487
And I just... It just...

945
01:09:59,987 --> 01:10:02,365
Have you ever really liked a girl
and you just couldn't have her?

946
01:10:04,701 --> 01:10:05,953
I'm... I'm sorry, man.

947
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:08,003
I'll just... I'll peace out
of your hair, man.

948
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:09,171
Thank you for...

949
01:10:19,382 --> 01:10:22,636
Hey, uh, where'd you go,
man? You're acting...

950
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:26,473
Dude, you're acting, like, really
sketchy right now. I don't...

951
01:10:28,266 --> 01:10:29,358
Uh...

952
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:32,645
What's up?

953
01:10:35,815 --> 01:10:37,817
I'm leaving, right...
I don't...

954
01:10:39,318 --> 01:10:40,444
I'm...

955
01:10:49,454 --> 01:10:52,128
Ow! Oh, my God!

956
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:54,459
Help me! Help!
Please! Somebody!

957
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:56,134
Somebody, help me, please!

958
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:57,632
Somebody, please!
Please, somebody!

959
01:10:58,004 --> 01:10:59,506
Somebody, please
help me! Please!

960
01:10:59,589 --> 01:11:00,636
Please, somebody, help me!

961
01:11:01,549 --> 01:11:03,893
Anybody! Anybody!
Oscar, come on.

962
01:11:03,968 --> 01:11:06,096
Please, dear God!
Please! Please!

963
01:11:07,054 --> 01:11:09,102
Help me! Help me! Help me!

964
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:10,812
Please help me!

965
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:24,280
Oscar!

966
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,568
Help! Let me in!

967
01:11:55,394 --> 01:11:56,941
Let me in!

968
01:12:00,358 --> 01:12:01,450
Help!

969
01:12:02,777 --> 01:12:03,903
Somebody!

970
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:06,447
Help!

971
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:10,581
Help! Help!

972
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:13,504
Somebody! Please!

973
01:12:14,372 --> 01:12:15,624
Help!

974
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:18,091
<i>'Cause my daughter
is not calling.</i>

975
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:19,134
<i>It's safer for you...</i>

976
01:12:19,252 --> 01:12:20,469
- She's not texting.
- Come on, Karen, let's go inside.

977
01:12:20,545 --> 01:12:21,671
Everyone's looking
for your daughter.

978
01:12:21,796 --> 01:12:22,843
Let them take care of it. So
whoever you had looking for her

979
01:12:22,922 --> 01:12:24,469
is obviously not able to
identify her.

980
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:25,842
- We're gonna find your daughter.
- It's Halloween.

981
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:27,017
We're gonna bring her here.
There are kids everywhere.

982
01:12:27,093 --> 01:12:28,436
Karen, come on.
There is no way.

983
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:29,888
Karen. Karen.
She had a costume, you know?

984
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:32,140
- We need to go in the house.
- We have everybody available...

985
01:12:32,223 --> 01:12:33,975
In the last 40 years, okay?

986
01:12:34,058 --> 01:12:35,605
Honey, if you let them do
their job, they're gonna...

987
01:12:35,685 --> 01:12:36,686
Karen!

988
01:12:43,401 --> 01:12:45,745
Just breathe. And if you
want, we can call someone...

989
01:12:51,075 --> 01:12:52,292
Stay in the car, Doctor.

990
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:53,995
You all right?
Take deep breaths, sweetheart.

991
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:55,375
He's down the street.
Okay.

992
01:12:55,496 --> 01:12:57,248
Okay. He's back. He
killed my friend.

993
01:12:57,331 --> 01:12:59,675
Everything's gonna
be all right. It's okay.

994
01:13:00,418 --> 01:13:01,544
Take a deep breath.

995
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:03,595
We're gonna take you back
to your mom, okay?

996
01:13:03,671 --> 01:13:05,594
I'm a doctor.
Lock your doors.

997
01:13:05,673 --> 01:13:08,301
Everybody, get back to your
houses now and lock your doors.

998
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:09,681
We're gonna take you
to your mom.

999
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,683
Don't worry about him.
Don't worry about him.

1000
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:14,349
Back in your houses now!

1001
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,017
You heard the officer.

1002
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:17,727
- What is going on?
- Back in your houses!

1003
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:19,278
Lock your goddamn doors.

1004
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:42,668
What's this?

1005
01:13:43,628 --> 01:13:44,754
It's my childhood.

1006
01:13:48,549 --> 01:13:49,550
Let's go.

1007
01:14:21,874 --> 01:14:23,501
All right, pick your poison.

1008
01:14:25,336 --> 01:14:27,930
I like a revolver.
They never jam.

1009
01:14:30,508 --> 01:14:32,852
This is accuracy
and stopping power.

1010
01:14:35,096 --> 01:14:36,473
This is tactical.

1011
01:14:36,931 --> 01:14:38,353
He waited for this night.

1012
01:14:39,225 --> 01:14:40,272
He's waited for me.

1013
01:14:40,977 --> 01:14:42,149
I've waited for him.

1014
01:14:44,563 --> 01:14:45,689
Come on, Michael.

1015
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:58,036
Allyson, keep your eyes open.

1016
01:14:58,369 --> 01:14:59,791
601.
He is out here somewhere.

1017
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:01,417
<i>Suspect reported on 11th,
near Saint Park.</i>

1018
01:15:01,664 --> 01:15:03,086
Copy that, Dispatch.

1019
01:15:03,874 --> 01:15:05,296
I got eyes.

1020
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:13,009
Look! It's him!
Here we go.

1021
01:15:15,302 --> 01:15:16,303
Brace yourselves.

1022
01:15:17,471 --> 01:15:19,394
Don't hit him!

1023
01:15:19,765 --> 01:15:21,233
- Watch out!
- Michael!

1024
01:15:28,691 --> 01:15:29,738
Don't shoot him.

1025
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:32,199
Doctor, get back in the car.
No!

1026
01:15:34,113 --> 01:15:35,740
You killed him.
He's dead.

1027
01:15:36,115 --> 01:15:37,458
Stand back.
No.

1028
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:39,661
I'm still gonna blow this
motherfucker's brains out.

1029
01:15:39,744 --> 01:15:41,417
Get away.
Leave my patient alone.

1030
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:43,335
Get away from the body.
Stand back.

1031
01:15:43,664 --> 01:15:45,712
I'm not gonna say it again.
Step away from the suspect.

1032
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:48,711
Step...

1033
01:15:56,343 --> 01:15:57,344
Fuck.

1034
01:16:05,936 --> 01:16:09,281
Help! Help! Help!

1035
01:16:22,953 --> 01:16:25,297
So this is what
it feels like.

1036
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:31,587
ALLYSON Help!

1037
01:17:14,421 --> 01:17:16,765
Make room for my patient.
No!

1038
01:17:25,266 --> 01:17:26,267
No!

1039
01:17:36,068 --> 01:17:40,164
These people want to kill this
man for the crimes you observed.

1040
01:17:40,698 --> 01:17:44,328
The most important opportunity to
understand the mind of evil, you see.

1041
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:46,629
So, when he awakes,
we'll be ready.

1042
01:17:48,164 --> 01:17:49,416
Ready for what?

1043
01:17:49,748 --> 01:17:50,874
A reunion.

1044
01:17:51,834 --> 01:17:56,305
Michael's pursuit of Laurie Strode
could be what keeps him alive.

1045
01:17:57,715 --> 01:18:01,185
I would suspect
the notion of being a predator

1046
01:18:01,719 --> 01:18:06,225
or the fear of becoming prey
keeps both of them alive.

1047
01:18:10,936 --> 01:18:12,188
You want a banh mi sandwich?

1048
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:13,318
A what? What is that?

1049
01:18:13,397 --> 01:18:14,740
A banh mi sandwich.
What's a...

1050
01:18:14,857 --> 01:18:16,609
What is that? I don't
even know what that is.

1051
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:18,535
I love that about you, Francis.
You're so predictable.

1052
01:18:18,611 --> 01:18:20,659
You're like a PB and J
every day kind of guy.

1053
01:18:20,738 --> 01:18:21,955
Oh, here we go.

1054
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:23,157
No, a banh mi sandwich.

1055
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:24,662
Banh mi is essentially just

1056
01:18:24,742 --> 01:18:27,871
the Vietnamese version
of a French baguette.

1057
01:18:28,037 --> 01:18:30,210
Mmm-hmm.
And the term actually refers

1058
01:18:30,289 --> 01:18:33,463
to the bread and not so much
the contents therein.

1059
01:18:33,584 --> 01:18:35,928
Mmm-hmm.
But your partner,

1060
01:18:36,003 --> 01:18:37,846
<i>the greatest partner tn the word.
Wow.</i>

1061
01:18:37,922 --> 01:18:41,222
...made an arrangement with the
Vietnamese folks at the restaurant

1062
01:18:41,592 --> 01:18:45,517
and had them make you your very own
peanut butter and jelly banh mi sandwich.

1063
01:18:47,598 --> 01:18:48,941
That sounds disgusting.

1064
01:18:49,016 --> 01:18:51,144
I'm not gonna try that.
I brought my own food.

1065
01:18:51,227 --> 01:18:52,604
I'm very happy with my...
What did you bring?

1066
01:18:52,811 --> 01:18:53,903
You want to see
what I brought'?

1067
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:55,276
Yeah, I do want
to see what you brought.

1068
01:18:56,232 --> 01:18:57,575
Ready? Look at this.
Look at that.

1069
01:18:58,525 --> 01:19:00,903
Fresh brownie.
Oh. Okay.

1070
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:03,580
Chocolaty homemade brownie.
I made that myself.

1071
01:19:03,656 --> 01:19:05,408
That's, like,
what a 5-year-old would eat

1072
01:19:05,491 --> 01:19:07,084
if they could make
their own lunch.

1073
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:09,374
I worked
with Michael for years,

1074
01:19:09,828 --> 01:19:12,456
but I've never seen him in
an uncontrolled environment.

1075
01:19:12,957 --> 01:19:14,709
I've never heard him
speak, you see.

1076
01:19:14,792 --> 01:19:17,887
In spite of my encouragements,
he remains unresponsive.

1077
01:19:18,671 --> 01:19:22,426
But tonight, so many
possibilities exist.

1078
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:26,595
He spoke to me.

1079
01:19:27,304 --> 01:19:31,059
He spoke to you? Yeah, um...
When he murdered my friend,

1080
01:19:31,141 --> 01:19:33,690
he saw me, and he spoke to me.

1081
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:34,941
What did he say?

1082
01:19:35,479 --> 01:19:36,696
One word.
What?

1083
01:19:37,147 --> 01:19:39,275
Let me go, and I will
tell you what he said.

1084
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:40,567
You must tell me. I must know.
You must tell me.

1085
01:19:40,651 --> 01:19:42,324
Let me go, and I'll tell you
what he said.

1086
01:19:42,403 --> 01:19:44,155
Just stop the car, and I'll
tell you what he said.

1087
01:19:51,912 --> 01:19:52,913
What is that?

1088
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:55,378
That's weird, right?

1089
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:56,792
Is that Hawkins?

1090
01:19:57,501 --> 01:19:58,502
I don't know.

1091
01:19:58,585 --> 01:19:59,928
What was the word?

1092
01:20:00,838 --> 01:20:02,431
Was it the sister's name?

1093
01:20:05,259 --> 01:20:06,260
Judith?

1094
01:20:13,309 --> 01:20:15,027
What was the word?
Fuck.

1095
01:20:17,396 --> 01:20:18,443
Michael.

1096
01:20:25,696 --> 01:20:27,539
606 to 601.

1097
01:20:29,241 --> 01:20:30,242
Hawkins.

1098
01:20:31,035 --> 01:20:32,833
Answer the fucking
radio, burnout.

1099
01:20:34,163 --> 01:20:35,164
<i>Hawkins?</i>

1100
01:20:37,041 --> 01:20:38,088
<i>606, 601.</i>

1101
01:20:39,293 --> 01:20:40,795
<i>Hawkins, please respond.</i>

1102
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:42,921
<i>Hawkins.</i>

1103
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:55,518
Let's go check it out.
All right.

1104
01:21:06,904 --> 01:21:07,905
Say something.

1105
01:21:31,845 --> 01:21:33,142
Can you see him?

1106
01:21:33,222 --> 01:21:34,849
<i>Hawkins, please respond.</i>

1107
01:21:35,849 --> 01:21:37,851
<i>Hawkins, please respond.</i>

1108
01:21:40,187 --> 01:21:42,030
Let's go and check it out.
All right.

1109
01:21:57,204 --> 01:21:59,673
Dispatch, be advised, we got
a man down. He's 10-7.

1110
01:22:00,249 --> 01:22:01,717
No sign of 601.

1111
01:22:27,484 --> 01:22:28,576
Karen, the lights.

1112
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:32,247
What are you doing? I thought
you said we were safer here.

1113
01:22:32,322 --> 01:22:34,666
You never wanted to listen
when I spoke of that night.

1114
01:22:34,741 --> 01:22:36,038
And this is why.

1115
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:39,163
I've been preparing for
this for a long time.

1116
01:22:39,288 --> 01:22:40,915
You want him to come here.

1117
01:22:40,998 --> 01:22:44,298
I'm so sorry, Karen.
I'm so sorry, baby.

1118
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:33,091
Any word?

1119
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:41,358
Hey, any word on Allyson?

1120
01:23:52,528 --> 01:23:53,529
Hey.

1121
01:23:54,488 --> 01:23:55,489
Guys.

1122
01:24:01,411 --> 01:24:02,913
What...

1123
01:24:32,609 --> 01:24:33,610
Ray!

1124
01:24:43,787 --> 01:24:44,788
Karen!

1125
01:24:47,958 --> 01:24:49,175
Where's Ray?

1126
01:24:51,378 --> 01:24:52,971
Michael's here.
Get downstairs.

1127
01:24:54,590 --> 01:24:56,137
Go, baby, go!

1128
01:25:49,061 --> 01:25:50,062
Mom!

1129
01:25:57,069 --> 01:25:58,070
Mom!

1130
01:26:56,086 --> 01:26:59,090
I was wrong to raise you the way I
did, but at least I can protect you.

1131
01:27:00,549 --> 01:27:02,096
Nothing will happen to you.

1132
01:27:03,176 --> 01:27:05,224
I know you thought
this was my cage.

1133
01:27:10,267 --> 01:27:11,268
I'm scared.

1134
01:27:53,518 --> 01:27:54,815
I have to finish this.

1135
01:27:59,733 --> 01:28:00,734
Mom.

1136
01:28:01,067 --> 01:28:02,990
I love you.
I love you, baby.

1137
01:28:58,166 --> 01:28:59,418
Come out, Michael.

1138
01:34:00,468 --> 01:34:01,469
Mom.

1139
01:34:06,975 --> 01:34:07,976
Grandmother?

1140
01:34:12,981 --> 01:34:13,982
Grandmother?

1141
01:34:22,532 --> 01:34:24,409
Baby.
Mom.

1142
01:34:24,492 --> 01:34:25,869
He's coming. Come on.

1143
01:34:26,035 --> 01:34:28,083
Come on. Come on.
Where's Grandmother?

1144
01:34:33,418 --> 01:34:34,761
I couldn't...
I couldn't find you guys.

1145
01:34:34,836 --> 01:34:37,259
It's okay. It's okay.

1146
01:34:52,937 --> 01:34:54,735
It's gonna be okay.
I'm locked in a cage.

1147
01:34:54,814 --> 01:34:56,612
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

1148
01:35:04,407 --> 01:35:05,408
Everything's
going to be okay.

1149
01:35:44,656 --> 01:35:47,284
Mom, I'm so sorry. I tried to
stop him from coming here.

1150
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:04,217
Okay. Okay.

1151
01:36:28,157 --> 01:36:29,158
Stay back.

1152
01:36:36,207 --> 01:36:37,709
Get back!
Get back, get back.

1153
01:36:49,470 --> 01:36:50,471
Stay back.

1154
01:36:58,271 --> 01:36:59,272
Mom?

1155
01:37:02,567 --> 01:37:03,693
Help us!

1156
01:37:04,485 --> 01:37:06,112
I can't do it.

1157
01:37:08,656 --> 01:37:11,284
I'm sorry.
I can't do it.

1158
01:37:15,538 --> 01:37:16,539
Gotcha.

1159
01:37:21,961 --> 01:37:23,929
Happy Halloween, Michael.

1160
01:37:35,058 --> 01:37:36,025
Come on, Allyson!

1161
01:37:36,142 --> 01:37:37,940
Come on, Allyson!
Allyson, go!

1162
01:37:38,019 --> 01:37:39,271
Allyson, come on!

1163
01:37:41,230 --> 01:37:42,231
Go!

1164
01:37:42,315 --> 01:37:44,283
Karen, come on, baby.
Come on!

1165
01:37:45,943 --> 01:37:46,944
Oh, God!

1166
01:37:54,285 --> 01:37:55,286
I got you!

1167
01:37:56,579 --> 01:37:57,705
Allyson, run!

1168
01:37:57,789 --> 01:38:00,338
Go! Go now!

1169
01:38:00,416 --> 01:38:01,508
Come on, kick him!

1170
01:38:01,918 --> 01:38:04,592
Allyson! Go!
Allyson, go!

1171
01:38:09,092 --> 01:38:10,093
Now go!

1172
01:38:34,492 --> 01:38:36,369
Okay. It's not
a cage, baby.

1173
01:38:38,830 --> 01:38:39,831
It's a trap.

1174
01:38:52,552 --> 01:38:53,724
Goodbye, Michael.

1175
01:39:52,236 --> 01:39:53,237
Oh, God,
someone's coming.

1176
01:39:53,321 --> 01:39:54,538
Someone's coming.

1177
01:39:57,825 --> 01:39:58,997
Hold her.
I got her.

1178
01:39:59,076 --> 01:40:00,328
I got her. Go!

1179
01:40:00,411 --> 01:40:01,537
Go, baby, go!

1180
01:40:02,246 --> 01:40:03,247
Hey!

1181
01:40:06,959 --> 01:40:07,960
Help us.
