1
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:05,005


2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,074


3
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:53,630
Radio host: Hope everybody's
ready to go out

4
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:54,855
and have a good time
tonight.

5
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,125
It's 8 P.M.,
Saturday evening,

6
00:00:57,158 --> 00:01:00,060
and it's still a hot one.

7
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:10,264
Officer:
Detail, atten-hut!

8
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:14,202
Present arms!

9
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:21,642
Man on radio: Com 2,
this is 5-0. We confirm.

10
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:40,661
Guard: I.D., please.

11
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:42,930
First sergeant white,
please proceed.

12
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:45,299
I believe I will.

13
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,867
Thank you kindly.

14
00:03:16,664 --> 00:03:19,633
Officer: Atten-hut!

15
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:41,855
Mc: And now I give you
a great general,

16
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,857
a great friend...

17
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,226
"Fighting" Joe Campbell!

18
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:00,874
At ease!

19
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,681
Thank you, all.

20
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:08,882
As you know,

21
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:12,620
my official retirement
isn't until next week.

22
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:15,623
But this here, now,

23
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:18,492
tonight with you

24
00:04:18,526 --> 00:04:20,060
is my real retirement.

25
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,996
Because you and i
have known fear together,

26
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,898
shed blood together,

27
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:27,601
battled pain
and suffering

28
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:30,003
and all of
their foot soldiers.

29
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:33,907
We know there is no glamour
in a sudden death

30
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:36,644
and that no one
ever wins a war,

31
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:37,911
and it is that knowledge

32
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,913
that will bind us together
forever.

33
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:42,716
That, and a love
for this country

34
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,952
that no bayonet can Pierce,

35
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:47,287
no bullet shatter.

36
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:54,928
To you.

37
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:56,464
All: To us!

38
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,981
Sergeant white here.

39
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:15,483
It's colonel Kent,
brenner,

40
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:16,960
so you can drop
the cheesy Southern accent.

41
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:17,951
Hey!

42
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,887
The only thing
keeping me alive

43
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,522
is that cheesy
Southern accent.

44
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:23,957
I was just checking up
on my favorite guest detective.

45
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,092
How you doing?

46
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,427
Oh, well,
you know, bill,

47
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,728
I just love
being undercover.

48
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:28,962
It's great.

49
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,740
I spent the last 2 weeks
smoking cheap cigars

50
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:33,501
and sweatin' my ass off
in that shitty houseboat.

51
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:35,569
Well, you got any sort
of time frame?

52
00:05:35,603 --> 00:05:37,605
Yeah. I'm meeting belling
tonight in the armory,

53
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:38,848
and then I'll
arrest him on Sunday

54
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:39,973
when we make
the exchange.

55
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,975
Then I'm going back
to Virginia.

56
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,687
All right, well, good enough.
Watch your back.

57
00:05:43,711 --> 00:05:47,681
Thank you. I believe I will.

58
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:56,356
Aww, man.

59
00:06:16,444 --> 00:06:17,478
Oww!

60
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:19,146
Out of gas?

61
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:20,814
Yeah.

62
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:22,816
That's why I'm looking
at a flat tire

63
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,685
with a pair of pliers
in my hand

64
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,487
instead of a lug wrench.

65
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:30,057
Uhh.

66
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:33,026
Uh-oh. She's a captain.

67
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,062
Uh-oh. She's a captain.

68
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:39,199
This looks like the work
of 10 chimpanzees.

69
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,168
Well, you just missed
the other 9.

70
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:43,036
They got bored
and went for a beer.

71
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,772
Hmm. Well,
i have a lug wrench.

72
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:45,973
Can I try?

73
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:49,409
Well, if you don't,
I'm gonna drag you over.

74
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,795
Get the spare.

75
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:09,429
Yes, ma'am.

76
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:22,976
Golly dang.

77
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:25,078
If you like piña coladas

78
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:26,814
and gettin' caught
in the rain,

79
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:30,150
I may just have to
marry you, captain.

80
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:33,887
You're gonna have to
take this in.

81
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:35,556
This spare's
just a temp tire.

82
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:38,792
Won't be good for more
than 30 miles or so.

83
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:41,128
Now, where would,
if a fella got courageous

84
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:44,231
and wanted to send you
a "thank you" notion

85
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:46,233
or a bauble
or a basket of fruit,

86
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:48,569
where might one find you?

87
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:49,903
Psy ops.

88
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:51,839
How's that?

89
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:53,106
Psychological
operations.

90
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,474
I teach there.

91
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:57,477
What do you teach?

92
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:01,615
Mostly we fuck
with people's minds.

93
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:11,592
Damn.

94
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,843
Brenner: There you go.

95
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:32,145
Genuine and made in the usa.

96
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,948
All you gotta do is give
dalbert and me 100,000 each

97
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:37,918
and you'll see them guns
come Sunday.

98
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:39,152
Belling:
You'll get your money

99
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,188
same time
i get the guns.

100
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:44,191
Now, you listen to me,
funny boy,

101
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:47,895
how do I know you ain't
one of them... them army cops?

102
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:49,863
Hey,
I'm a freedom fighter.

103
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:53,166
Well, check it out,
dalbert.

104
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,035
We-doggie!

105
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:58,038
We got ourselves
che fucking Guevara there.

106
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:00,173
Whoop-de-doo,
a freedom fighter.

107
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:03,777
Well, where's your
kooky red hat, boy?

108
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:05,613
Ain't never been
a freedom fighter worth a gob

109
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:08,882
ain't got him
a kooky red hat.

110
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,584
You listen to me,
stupid.

111
00:09:10,618 --> 00:09:11,551
Dalbert,

112
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:14,788
I think it's one of them,
uh, freudian, uh...

113
00:09:14,822 --> 00:09:15,789
Uhh!

114
00:09:15,823 --> 00:09:17,257
What? No.

115
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,192
Aah!

116
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,794
Hey, dalbert.
Dalbert.

117
00:09:20,828 --> 00:09:21,895
What?

118
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:22,896
Want to hear a joke?

119
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:23,931
No.

120
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:25,999
How many freedom fighters

121
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:28,001
does it take to screw in
a light bulb?

122
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:29,136
I don't know!

123
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:31,238
Hey, come on, man.
Relax, huh?

124
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:34,074
Well, he don't sound like no
criminal investigator to me.

125
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:35,609
No.
No.

126
00:09:35,643 --> 00:09:36,910
No.

127
00:09:36,944 --> 00:09:38,378
Well,
you're all right, pal!

128
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,313
I'm sorry about all that,
but, you know,

129
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:44,217
we get a little jumpy
around here before an exchange.

130
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:47,220
So we'll see you Sunday,
then.

131
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,221
I'll be there.

132
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:52,259
Yeah, you be there.
All right.

133
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:55,829
Oh, unclench your
ass cheeks, dalbert.

134
00:09:55,863 --> 00:09:58,832
The scary part is over.

135
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:36,436
Oh, don't tell me...
You need your oil changed.

136
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:40,774
Nope. This is a token
of my appreciation.

137
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:49,883
These are
strange chocolates.

138
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:51,418
They're bath products.

139
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:53,754
Bath products.

140
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:55,088
Bath products?

141
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:56,289
Mm-hmm.

142
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:57,825
Should I take a hint?

143
00:10:57,858 --> 00:10:59,893
No, of course not.

144
00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:01,294
Just bath products.

145
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,096
Everybody likes
bath products.

146
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,998
Do you?

147
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:06,767
Yes, I do.

148
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,036
Really? Tell me what you
like about bath products.

149
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:10,403
Well, I...

150
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:12,305
I like the pink soaps,

151
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:15,175
and I like
the skin softener,

152
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,844
and I like
the bath beads.

153
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:19,046
I particularly
like the bath beads.

154
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,048
Sometimes I draw a tub,

155
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:22,315
and I fill that tub

156
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,484
with skin softeners
and bath beads,

157
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,787
and I light
a few candles,

158
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,356
I put on
a little Coltrane,

159
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:32,125
and I just soak
my troubles away.

160
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:35,028
Very good,
first sergeant.

161
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:38,331
I levied a none-too-subtle
accusation of sexism at you,

162
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:41,134
and you took it 3 times
around the dance floor.

163
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:42,936
Not really.

164
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,272
I just dig bath beads.

165
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:47,941
Well, thank you.

166
00:11:47,975 --> 00:11:50,343
Maybe I'll see you around.

167
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,345
Am I being dismissed?

168
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,482
Do you mind terribly?
I've got a ton of work here.

169
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:57,785
No.

170
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:00,487
I just, uh, came by
to give you that.

171
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,956
Thank you.
It was sweet.

172
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,391
How's the tire?

173
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,529
Still rollin'. Yeah.

174
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,399
I'm glad.

175
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:16,069
Good-bye,
first sergeant.

176
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:18,371
Good-bye, captain.

177
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:05,218
Anchorwoman on TV:
Having announced his retirement,

178
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:06,419
general Joseph Campbell

179
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,889
is being considered
for the vice presidency.

180
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:11,191
Sources close to presidential
candidate bill post

181
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:14,161
tell us he is poised to select
general Joseph Campbell

182
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:15,262
as his running mate.

183
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,429
Earlier this year,

184
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,265
the general gave
the commencement address

185
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,867
at west point.

186
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,444
While it was meant to be
a nonpartisan appearance,

187
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,470
it certainly played
like a stump speech.

188
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:25,238
Campbell on TV:
Leading this country...

189
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:28,942
That is your destiny.

190
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:36,116
Anchorwoman: We'll be back
for more in a moment.

191
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,262
Shit!

192
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:47,080
Aah!

193
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:15,535
Soldier:
Pretty good.

194
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:17,837
Get way over
to that car, ok?

195
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,039
Ok.

196
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,115
And take it
into the door.

197
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:41,594
Ok. Backing out.

198
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:47,100
Snag.

199
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:48,435
On what?

200
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:50,069
I don't know.

201
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:52,405
Let's take a look.

202
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,758
Deputy:
Paul brenner!

203
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,526
Phone call
for Paul brenner!

204
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,727
What'd you say
your name is?

205
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:15,728
Frank white.

206
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,197
You military?

207
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,465
Yes, sir, I am.

208
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:20,433
I'm a sergeant
at the post armory.

209
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,736
Deputy:
Cid agent brenner?

210
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,481
And he walked out,
and the next thing I know,

211
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:26,673
you know,
he's blasting away.

212
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:28,741
Oh, you military boys
got stories

213
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:31,744
more full of holes
than a target range.

214
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:32,745
Sorry, pop.

215
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,547
It's colonel Kent
at the base.

216
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:35,915
Is there
a brenner here?

217
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:36,549
No.

218
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,485
I'm brenner.

219
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:39,852
I thought you was white.

220
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:42,222
I'm both.
Skunked ya.

221
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:44,557
Chief yardley.

222
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:45,758
Hey, bill.

223
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:48,628
No, man, it's over.
Belling's dead.

224
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:51,931
Ok. All right,
I'll see you there.

225
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:52,699
Thanks.

226
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:55,202
Yardley: Hold on,
soldier boy.

227
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:58,471
I want you to tell me
about this Mr. belling.

228
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:00,773
Soldier boy?

229
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:03,810
Ok, chiefie,
if you have to know.

230
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:05,745
I was planning to arrest him
in the morning

231
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:06,913
during weapons exchange.

232
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:08,948
But I guess he got wind
that I was part

233
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,951
of the criminal
investigation division.

234
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,254
See ya.

235
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,660
Good morning, sir.
Where to?

236
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:22,429
Urban warfare site.

237
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:25,808
You have business there,
sir?

238
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:26,833
Yes, I do.

239
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:28,735
Very good, sir.

240
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,419
Hey, bill.

241
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:47,854
Hello, Paul.

242
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:54,327
What have we got here?

243
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:56,996
Kent: Tortured...

244
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,866
Raped...

245
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:01,434
And murdered.

246
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:02,569
Mm-hmm.

247
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:07,474
Who found the body?

248
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:09,842
A bomb squad crew
doing exercises.

249
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,845
They called the tower,
tower called me.

250
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:14,881
First on the scene
was a pfc Robbins.

251
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:17,717
Mm-hmm.
Is he a suspect?

252
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,653
She.
So I sincerely doubt it.

253
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:22,555
Mm-hmm.

254
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:24,657
I have 6 of my boys
securing the scene.

255
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:26,359
Nothing's been touched.

256
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,247
Oh, no.

257
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:51,418
Kent: What is it, Paul?

258
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:55,622
I... I met her
the oth... the other day.

259
00:20:55,655 --> 00:20:58,525
Damn.

260
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:00,893
What a shame.

261
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:03,330
Lovely, lovely lady.

262
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:07,900
All right, let's see.
We got, um...

263
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:11,638
We got some rigor here.

264
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:14,341
Patechial hemorrhaging,

265
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:18,511
which is consistent
with asphyxia.

266
00:21:18,545 --> 00:21:20,513
Strangulation,
you think?

267
00:21:20,547 --> 00:21:23,450
Well, I'm assuming that,

268
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:25,952
but there's no tear
in the panties and...

269
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:29,922
No obvious sign of semen.

270
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:31,458
Is that hers?

271
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:33,059
Yeah.

272
00:21:41,568 --> 00:21:44,036
Why is she here?

273
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,972
Oh, h.Q. Called her.

274
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:48,941
She's a rape counselor.
Name is Sarah sunhill.

275
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:50,877
The victim doesn't
need counseling, bill.

276
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,345
She's dead.

277
00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:54,481
Yes, but she's also
a rape investigator.

278
00:21:54,514 --> 00:21:56,949
She was on her way
to another assignment,

279
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,818
and she agreed
to stay on for this.

280
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:00,453
Aren't we lucky?

281
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:07,427
Get forensics up here
from fort gillum.

282
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,729
Talk to Cal seiver.
He's the guy I work with.

283
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:11,130
Get a 50-yard grid
around the body

284
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,965
and make resin casts
of all the boot prints.

285
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,434
Let's see who was
here and when,

286
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:16,536
including disqualifying prints
of you and yours.

287
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:17,637
We also need records.

288
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,907
Captain Campbell's personal
and medical records. Asap.

289
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,575
I already did that.

290
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:24,811
Thank you.

291
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:25,845
You're welcome.

292
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:28,014
Uh, Sarah sunhill,
Paul bren...

293
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:30,717
Also, I want you to book
a sergeant dalbert elkins

294
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,851
at the armory.

295
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:33,095
He's the one who started
that arms deal

296
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:34,587
I was working on.

297
00:22:34,621 --> 00:22:35,988
Now...

298
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:38,991
She walked barefoot
from here to where she died.

299
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:40,627
Kent: Why do you
assume that?

300
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,162
The smudge marks
on her heels and asphalt.

301
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,864
Now, where does she live?
Victory gardens.

302
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:45,998
Now, where is that?

303
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:48,167
I believe
that's off post.

304
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,536
Yeah, well,
i have to go there.

305
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:51,003
I'll call the burfort
police chief.

306
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:52,715
He'll get a court order
and meet us out there.

307
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:54,483
No. That's yardley.
I don't want to work with him.

308
00:22:54,507 --> 00:22:55,747
Let's keep it
in the family, ok?

309
00:22:55,775 --> 00:22:58,010
Now, you can't
search her off-post house

310
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:00,012
without getting
a civilian search warrant.

311
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:01,681
Oh, come on, bill.

312
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:05,452
You need
civilian authority.

313
00:23:06,786 --> 00:23:08,555
Sometimes we got to
protect Paul brenner

314
00:23:08,588 --> 00:23:09,722
from himself.

315
00:23:09,756 --> 00:23:12,825
Does she have
family here?

316
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:14,026
Of course.

317
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,962
I suggest you notify them
right away.

318
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:19,766
Officer:
Detail, atten-hut!

319
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:23,135
Present arms!

320
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:26,038
You're, uh,
you're kidding, right?

321
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:27,840
Kidding about what?

322
00:23:27,874 --> 00:23:29,075
It's Elisabeth Campbell,
Paul.

323
00:23:29,108 --> 00:23:31,210
She's his kid.

324
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,780
Oh, no.

325
00:23:33,813 --> 00:23:34,947
Thought you knew.

326
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:36,516
No, I didn't.

327
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:37,149
Damn.

328
00:23:37,183 --> 00:23:39,652
The general's daughter.

329
00:23:39,686 --> 00:23:41,053
Yup.

330
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:56,869
What are you doing?

331
00:23:56,903 --> 00:23:59,438
I feel queasy.

332
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,108
Well, hop on,
I'll burp you.

333
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:04,877
Drive the car, Paul.

334
00:24:04,911 --> 00:24:07,780
Thought you said
you were queasy.

335
00:24:07,814 --> 00:24:10,983
Drive the car, Paul.

336
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,187
Sunhill: Now, look,

337
00:24:15,221 --> 00:24:16,623
I think I can help you
on this one,

338
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:18,124
but I don't want it
to be awkward.

339
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:21,093
Awkward? Now, why would you
think it would be awkward?

340
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:22,194
You're pouting.

341
00:24:22,228 --> 00:24:24,096
This is not pouting.

342
00:24:25,532 --> 00:24:26,799
Ok.

343
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:28,535
Sulky petulance, then.

344
00:24:28,568 --> 00:24:30,903
Wrong again.
This is just, uh...

345
00:24:30,937 --> 00:24:33,105
Thinking about Brussels,
you know?

346
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:34,841
We'll always have Brussels.

347
00:24:34,874 --> 00:24:35,842
Where?

348
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:38,477
The capital of Belgium.

349
00:24:39,846 --> 00:24:41,113
Why?

350
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:44,584
Why is it the capital,
or why will we always have it?

351
00:24:48,054 --> 00:24:49,589
Why was she murdered?

352
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,125
Well, possible motives
for murder

353
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:54,827
are profit, revenge,
jealousy,

354
00:24:54,861 --> 00:24:57,730
to conceal a crime, to avoid
humiliation and disgrace,

355
00:24:57,764 --> 00:25:01,500
or plain old homicidal mania.
Right there in the manual.

356
00:25:25,925 --> 00:25:27,560
Ooh, boy.

357
00:25:27,594 --> 00:25:28,861
Yup.

358
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,335
Brenner: Hello. We're here
to see the general.

359
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,804
Warrant officer
Paul brenner.

360
00:25:37,837 --> 00:25:38,871
Sarah sunhill.

361
00:25:38,905 --> 00:25:40,072
Oh, yes.

362
00:25:40,106 --> 00:25:42,174
I'm captain elby,
the general's aide.

363
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:45,111
Colonel Fowler,
the general's adjutant,

364
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:46,345
will take you in.

365
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,314
Please wait right here.

366
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,784
He's cute.

367
00:25:51,818 --> 00:25:53,285
Oh, please.

368
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:55,922
Probably practices
his salute in the mirror

369
00:25:55,955 --> 00:25:57,657
for hour...

370
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:00,092
Please, come in.

371
00:26:00,126 --> 00:26:02,094
And thank you
for coming.

372
00:26:09,702 --> 00:26:13,139
General, the cid
investigators are here.

373
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,142
Warrant officers
Paul brenner

374
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:17,877
and Sarah sunhill, sir.

375
00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:20,813
My deepest condolences,
sir.

376
00:26:20,847 --> 00:26:24,383
Brenner: Very sorry
for your loss, sir.

377
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,318
Thank you.

378
00:26:26,352 --> 00:26:29,121
Please, be seated.

379
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:38,230
First,
i want you to know

380
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:40,867
that you have
my full cooperation

381
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,936
and the cooperation
of everyone on this base.

382
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,237
Thank you, sir.

383
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:47,239
You understand
the time element?

384
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:50,009
The time element?
No, sir.

385
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:52,979
After 36 hours, the FBI
will send in a task force

386
00:26:53,012 --> 00:26:54,280
to investigate,

387
00:26:54,313 --> 00:26:57,684
but we prefer to keep this
an army matter.

388
00:26:57,717 --> 00:27:00,252
The general can keep a lid
on it through tomorrow.

389
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:02,188
Once the FBI moves in,

390
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:03,990
the media will be
all over this base.

391
00:27:04,023 --> 00:27:05,624
And my daughter's...

392
00:27:08,027 --> 00:27:11,263
Captain Campbell's death...

393
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:14,000
They'll turn it
into a goddamn circus.

394
00:27:14,033 --> 00:27:16,803
We'll do everything
we can, sir.

395
00:27:16,836 --> 00:27:18,637
I'm sure you will.

396
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,843
Look, let me be blunt.

397
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:27,146
You're going to have to
decide on this one, Paul...

398
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:30,282
Are you a soldier
or a policeman?

399
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:32,819
I'm a soldier, sir.

400
00:27:32,852 --> 00:27:36,889
I'm counting on it.

401
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:41,794
Sir,
i met your daughter.

402
00:27:42,862 --> 00:27:44,296
Really?

403
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,932
When was that?

404
00:27:45,965 --> 00:27:48,100
Well, it was just
a coincidence,

405
00:27:48,134 --> 00:27:51,470
but, uh, she helped me
change a tire.

406
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,242
That she could do.

407
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:58,410
She could do
almost anything.

408
00:27:58,444 --> 00:28:00,246
Her mother
was the same way.

409
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:03,249
Fix a tire, make a hell
of a key lime pie,

410
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:05,852
speak 5 languages.

411
00:28:05,885 --> 00:28:07,253
Extraordinary woman.

412
00:28:07,286 --> 00:28:11,023
2 extraordinary women.

413
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:17,696
Goddamn waste.

414
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,513
Again, our deepest
sympathies, sir.

415
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,339
And if there's
anything else

416
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:28,941
we can do for you
at this time...

417
00:28:28,975 --> 00:28:30,943
Just...

418
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,049
Just find
the son of a bitch.

419
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:38,717
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

420
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,858
Sir?

421
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:49,361
When I enlisted,
i was underage.

422
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:54,066
They... they sent me
straight to Vietnam,

423
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,401
and you were
my commander.

424
00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:58,370
You were a captain,

425
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:02,241
and I... I was so scared.

426
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:03,976
And one day
when I was on watch,

427
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:05,244
you came by and...

428
00:29:05,277 --> 00:29:07,546
And... and you saw
the fear. You...

429
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,917
You said, um, "well,
where are you from?"

430
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,551
And I said, "Boston."

431
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,121
And you said, "did you
know that last night

432
00:29:15,154 --> 00:29:17,123
"the Boston Red Sox won

433
00:29:17,156 --> 00:29:19,025
"against
the St. Louis cardinals

434
00:29:19,058 --> 00:29:20,827
in the sixth game
of the series?"

435
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:24,263
And you just
walked away.

436
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:27,399
Well, I knew...
I knew then that, uh...

437
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:29,335
I was gonna
get through it.

438
00:29:32,138 --> 00:29:33,539
Boston lost that series.

439
00:29:33,572 --> 00:29:37,776
Yes, but I made it home.

440
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:42,882
We'll find the son
of a bitch, sir.

441
00:29:56,929 --> 00:29:58,497
Mr. brenner.

442
00:30:02,568 --> 00:30:05,371
I understand you have
special arrest powers.

443
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:06,438
Yes, sir.

444
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:08,307
But I'm going to ask

445
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,242
before you
arrest anyone,

446
00:30:10,276 --> 00:30:11,377
you notify me.

447
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:14,480
Why is that, sir?

448
00:30:14,513 --> 00:30:16,082
We don't like
our personnel

449
00:30:16,115 --> 00:30:18,250
being arrested
by outside people

450
00:30:18,284 --> 00:30:19,986
without
our knowing about it.

451
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:23,389
There are 3 ways
of doing things...

452
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:26,993
The right way,
the wrong way,

453
00:30:27,026 --> 00:30:27,894
and the army way.

454
00:30:27,927 --> 00:30:31,597
See that in doing it
your way, Mr. brenner,

455
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:34,833
you don't forget
about the army way.

456
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:01,627
Our job here at psy ops
is to panic the enemy,

457
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,662
to blunt
his will to fight.

458
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,165
A psy operator must know
the customs and habits

459
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:07,366
of the enemy,

460
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:10,369
the current dissensions,
anxieties, and fears

461
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:11,971
to determine
vulnerability.

462
00:31:12,004 --> 00:31:15,207
To engage the enemy,
you must know the enemy

463
00:31:15,241 --> 00:31:16,208
inside out.

464
00:31:16,242 --> 00:31:18,244
You must fill him
with fear,

465
00:31:18,277 --> 00:31:21,080
and not just fear of dying.

466
00:31:21,113 --> 00:31:24,516
Fear of grotesque wounds
is much more terrifying.

467
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:27,386
Ugh.
Grotesque wounds.

468
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:30,889
I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

469
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:35,027
May I help you?

470
00:31:36,328 --> 00:31:38,998
Might I ask what you're doing
in captain Campbell's office?

471
00:31:39,031 --> 00:31:40,699
That depends
on who you are.

472
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,635
So comfortably ensconced
in her office, I might add.

473
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:46,538
Colonel Robert Moore.

474
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:47,715
Captain Campbell's
commanding officer

475
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,575
here at psy ops.
And you are?

476
00:31:49,608 --> 00:31:53,112
We're from the criminal
investigation division.

477
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:56,182
Warrant officers sunhill
and brenner.

478
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:59,585
And you're investigating?

479
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:02,054
The murder
of captain Campbell.

480
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:06,692
And now that
we know who you are,

481
00:32:06,725 --> 00:32:09,728
we'll need to
speak to you, colonel.

482
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,363
Of course.

483
00:32:11,397 --> 00:32:13,599
I just have, uh...

484
00:32:13,632 --> 00:32:17,003
I have a meeting.

485
00:32:17,036 --> 00:32:19,571
Something tells me
we could file colonel Moore

486
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:21,940
under "last to know."

487
00:32:25,411 --> 00:32:26,578
Are you married?

488
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:28,314
None of your business.

489
00:32:28,347 --> 00:32:30,216
Right.

490
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:38,357
Sunhill: Well,
she wasn't a hypochondriac.

491
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:41,160
She didn't dye her hair,
she didn't have oily skin,

492
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:43,595
and she keeps her method
of birth control

493
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:45,064
somewhere else.

494
00:32:45,097 --> 00:32:47,633
Or perhaps she required
her men to wear condoms.

495
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:50,702
Maybe you've heard that
condoms are in fashion again

496
00:32:50,736 --> 00:32:52,738
because of disease.

497
00:32:52,771 --> 00:32:54,606
Nowadays
you have to boil people

498
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,408
before you can
sleep with them.

499
00:32:56,442 --> 00:32:58,210
Care for a bath?

500
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,615
Oh, my.

501
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:05,751
This was one
squared-away soldier.

502
00:33:05,784 --> 00:33:08,720
Equally prepared
for a military ball

503
00:33:08,754 --> 00:33:11,623
or the next war
in the jungle.

504
00:33:17,363 --> 00:33:18,497
Moore on machine:
Liz, hi.

505
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:20,099
Uh, pick up.
It's Robert.

506
00:33:20,132 --> 00:33:24,403
I haven't heard from you,
so, ahem, call me, please.

507
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:27,239
Robert.

508
00:33:27,273 --> 00:33:29,508
Surprise, surprise.

509
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:46,192
Sunhill: Paul?

510
00:33:46,225 --> 00:33:48,160
Move aside.

511
00:33:48,194 --> 00:33:50,096
Man with a gun.

512
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:24,730
Sunhill:
There's nothing here.

513
00:34:24,763 --> 00:34:26,632
Let's go.

514
00:34:51,457 --> 00:34:53,725
There's a false wall.

515
00:35:16,482 --> 00:35:18,750
Uhh. Ha.

516
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:20,886
This is it.

517
00:35:25,524 --> 00:35:27,693
Oh, my god.

518
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:46,312
Brenner:
What have we got here?

519
00:35:46,345 --> 00:35:50,349
10 bucks says these are not
the lost honeymooners episodes.

520
00:36:17,576 --> 00:36:20,178
Get down!

521
00:36:25,651 --> 00:36:27,219
What do you think
you're doing?

522
00:36:27,253 --> 00:36:28,720
Stop it!

523
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,332
Aah!

524
00:36:44,436 --> 00:36:48,740
Well, how she died
does appear to be linked

525
00:36:48,774 --> 00:36:50,476
to how she lived.

526
00:36:54,413 --> 00:36:56,748
All right.
What we need to do here

527
00:36:56,782 --> 00:36:57,983
is to hold on
to these tapes

528
00:36:58,016 --> 00:36:59,385
till we need them.

529
00:36:59,418 --> 00:37:00,552
We empty the house,

530
00:37:00,586 --> 00:37:02,554
send this all
to the cid lab,

531
00:37:02,588 --> 00:37:03,855
padlock the house,

532
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:06,858
and we take our chances
with the local police staff.

533
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:08,560
Is this Paul brenner
speaking?

534
00:37:08,594 --> 00:37:09,795
This is Paul brenner,

535
00:37:09,828 --> 00:37:11,530
the career army officer
speaking,

536
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:12,798
not the cop.

537
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:14,008
The evidence of her killer
might be on that tape.

538
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:15,000
I don't have to
tell you that.

539
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:16,735
There's enough
evidence here

540
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:17,879
to ruin the lives
of everyone involved,

541
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:20,238
including the general.

542
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,041
Now, look,
we take the tapes,

543
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,810
we use them
when we need them,

544
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:28,347
let cid do their job,

545
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:31,317
and keep all nonmilitary
out of this, ok?

546
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,488
Ok.

547
00:37:36,522 --> 00:37:37,889
Good.

548
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:39,925
I'll call Kent.

549
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:41,493
All right. Here.

550
00:37:41,527 --> 00:37:42,594
It's hot.

551
00:37:42,628 --> 00:37:44,262
Thanks.

552
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:04,916
The phone's down.

553
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:08,420
I'm gonna go use
the cell in the car.

554
00:38:21,367 --> 00:38:22,434
Aah!

555
00:38:46,925 --> 00:38:48,326
Sunhill: Paul?

556
00:38:49,461 --> 00:38:51,329
Paul!

557
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:01,840
Did you make out
a face?

558
00:39:01,873 --> 00:39:03,074
Yeah.

559
00:39:03,108 --> 00:39:06,445
It was flat, steel,
and used to clear snow.

560
00:39:06,478 --> 00:39:08,780
Come on.

561
00:39:08,814 --> 00:39:09,857
So did you ever
marry that guy

562
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:11,450
you were seeing
on the side?

563
00:39:11,483 --> 00:39:14,152
Paul, this isn't exactly
the time to be...

564
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,020
Humor me.

565
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:16,121
I'm near concussed.

566
00:39:16,154 --> 00:39:18,023
Now, did you
or did you not

567
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:19,858
marry the guy you were
seeing on the side?

568
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:22,794
I was engaged to that guy.
I was seeing you on the side.

569
00:39:22,828 --> 00:39:24,362
Fine.

570
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:26,998
So how is the boy major?

571
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:28,476
He seemed a little annoyed
the last time

572
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,903
I saw him in Brussels
with a pistol in his hand.

573
00:39:35,774 --> 00:39:37,042
Make a hole!

574
00:39:42,781 --> 00:39:44,382
Identification,
please.

575
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:47,953
Are you working on
the murder case, ma'am?

576
00:39:47,986 --> 00:39:50,622
Yes, I am.
And this is my father.

577
00:39:50,656 --> 00:39:51,957
Please proceed.

578
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,645
What happened to you?

579
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:14,913
Went off post...

580
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:16,047
Without
civilian authority.

581
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:17,916
And my head paid
the price for it.

582
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:19,084
There you go.

583
00:40:19,117 --> 00:40:20,218
Per your request.

584
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,087
Is this
her entire record file?

585
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,922
That's it.

586
00:40:23,955 --> 00:40:25,524
Come up
with anything yet?

587
00:40:25,557 --> 00:40:27,793
No. Just a preliminary
list of suspects.

588
00:40:27,826 --> 00:40:29,461
Already? Who?

589
00:40:29,495 --> 00:40:30,929
Everyone.

590
00:40:30,962 --> 00:40:33,098
Well, you ought to
start getting alibis.

591
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:35,066
Ok, how about you?

592
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,068
Home in bed
when the tower called.

593
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:38,236
Aha!
Oh, fuck off, Paul.

594
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,871
Where were you
last night?

595
00:40:39,905 --> 00:40:41,082
I was busy killing
someone else.

596
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:42,674
I didn't have time
to kill 2 people.

597
00:40:42,708 --> 00:40:43,975
Likely story.

598
00:40:44,009 --> 00:40:45,110
And you?

599
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:48,113
Uh, I went to the v.O.Q.
At 1900 hours.

600
00:40:48,146 --> 00:40:50,115
I worked on my neely
case report

601
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:51,116
till about midnight,

602
00:40:51,149 --> 00:40:53,619
and then I went home.

603
00:40:53,652 --> 00:40:54,820
No witnesses.

604
00:40:54,853 --> 00:40:56,087
Pathetic,
the both of you.

605
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:58,557
Oh, you should have
invited me up to your room,

606
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,091
and we would have had
an alibi.

607
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:03,194
I would rather be
a murder suspect.

608
00:41:03,228 --> 00:41:04,095
Ohh.

609
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:05,997
Don't encourage her.

610
00:41:06,031 --> 00:41:07,666
By the way,
Cal seiver's here.

611
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:08,634
Oh, good.

612
00:41:08,667 --> 00:41:10,636
Now, look, Cal is the best
forensic man around,

613
00:41:10,669 --> 00:41:11,979
but don't say anything
about his hair.

614
00:41:12,003 --> 00:41:13,043
What's wrong
with his hair?

615
00:41:13,071 --> 00:41:14,706
He doesn't have any.

616
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,107
Hey, Cal!

617
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:19,110
Shouldn't you be
wearing a hat?

618
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:20,879
What the hell
happened to you?

619
00:41:20,912 --> 00:41:24,115
Well, you know, not everybody
loves me as much as you do, Cal.

620
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:25,083
This is Sarah sunhill.

621
00:41:25,116 --> 00:41:26,251
Hello.
How are you?

622
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:28,053
The entire world walked
around this body.

623
00:41:28,086 --> 00:41:30,556
Paul, there's gotta be
50 boot prints here.

624
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:32,157
Have you found
the clothes yet?

625
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,259
Not yet. I figured
you'd want some space,

626
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:35,994
so I commandeered
an empty hangar.

627
00:41:36,027 --> 00:41:38,129
Good man.
Have everything taken there.

628
00:41:38,163 --> 00:41:40,065
Is there any trace
of semen on the victim?

629
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:42,133
I ran an ultraviolet.
I can't find any.

630
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:43,835
The coroner
will run vaginal,

631
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:45,103
oral, and anal swabs,

632
00:41:45,136 --> 00:41:46,872
and we'll know about
that in due course.

633
00:41:46,905 --> 00:41:49,074
It is a strange rape.

634
00:41:49,107 --> 00:41:50,141
Yeah.

635
00:41:50,175 --> 00:41:51,777
Why do you say that?

636
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:54,145
Well, our guy wasn't
just a rapist. Excuse me.

637
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:55,881
He was
a premeditated killer.

638
00:41:55,914 --> 00:41:57,248
Brenner: Go ahead.

639
00:41:57,282 --> 00:42:00,786
He set up a rape kit,
tent pegs, and ropes,

640
00:42:00,819 --> 00:42:01,820
and he used it.

641
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:02,921
Yeah.

642
00:42:02,954 --> 00:42:06,157
Well, there are no signs
of a struggle.

643
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:07,593
She was a strong woman.

644
00:42:07,626 --> 00:42:08,760
I couldn't find
a bit of dirt

645
00:42:08,794 --> 00:42:10,629
under her fingernails.

646
00:42:10,662 --> 00:42:11,963
And how did he
hold a gun on her

647
00:42:11,997 --> 00:42:13,198
and manage to
tie the ropes?

648
00:42:13,231 --> 00:42:16,635
Unless it was
more than one person.

649
00:42:16,668 --> 00:42:18,904
What are those marks
on her cheeks?

650
00:42:18,937 --> 00:42:22,040
Those were tears, Paul.

651
00:42:23,942 --> 00:42:25,310
The panties
under the rope

652
00:42:25,343 --> 00:42:27,746
as if to protect
her neck from a burn.

653
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:29,180
I mean, what's
a little rope burn

654
00:42:29,214 --> 00:42:30,916
if you're going
to kill somebody?

655
00:42:30,949 --> 00:42:33,118
Sunhill's good.

656
00:42:33,151 --> 00:42:35,220
Oh, yeah.

657
00:42:35,253 --> 00:42:37,188
Sunhill has spoken.

658
00:43:41,052 --> 00:43:44,189
Brenner: Could you see
the body from here, private?

659
00:43:44,222 --> 00:43:46,792
No. But I saw
the headlights.

660
00:43:46,825 --> 00:43:48,259
The headlights?

661
00:43:48,293 --> 00:43:50,361
I... I hated
that it was her.

662
00:43:50,395 --> 00:43:52,130
Sunhill:
You knew her, then?

663
00:43:52,163 --> 00:43:54,399
No. But, um...

664
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:58,269
Captain Campbell
was, uh...

665
00:43:58,303 --> 00:44:01,406
She was real good
to female enlisted.

666
00:44:01,439 --> 00:44:02,373
How so?

667
00:44:02,407 --> 00:44:06,778
She, uh, organized
meetings for us, and, uh...

668
00:44:08,313 --> 00:44:10,148
See, there's a lot
of shit...

669
00:44:10,181 --> 00:44:14,285
I mean, there's a lot of stuff
if you're a woman in the army

670
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:17,422
to... that you got to
put up with, and, uh...

671
00:44:17,455 --> 00:44:20,025
A lot of people don't like
that we're here.

672
00:44:20,058 --> 00:44:25,163
But captain Campbell,
she encouraged us, and, uh...

673
00:44:25,196 --> 00:44:26,998
I'm sorry!

674
00:44:27,032 --> 00:44:28,099
You're allowed
to cry.

675
00:44:28,133 --> 00:44:29,476
No, it's all right.
It's all right.

676
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,069
Now, what about
the headlights?

677
00:44:31,102 --> 00:44:32,370
Now, you didn't...

678
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:33,480
Didn't you think
it was someone coming home

679
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:36,241
or using the latrine
or something?

680
00:44:36,274 --> 00:44:37,442
Sometimes people
go out there

681
00:44:37,475 --> 00:44:41,046
when the nights are nice
to fuck.

682
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:43,882
Pardon my French.

683
00:44:45,483 --> 00:44:47,118
But that's what
i thought...

684
00:44:47,152 --> 00:44:48,419
The first time.

685
00:44:48,453 --> 00:44:49,888
Both: The first time?

686
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:53,458
The first time I saw
the headlights was at 0300.

687
00:44:53,491 --> 00:44:57,963
They went away,
and they came back at 0330.

688
00:44:57,996 --> 00:45:02,000
Then they went away again,
then they came back at 0400.

689
00:45:04,836 --> 00:45:07,038
Ok. Thank you.

690
00:45:12,243 --> 00:45:14,379
Brenner:
What's going on, bill?

691
00:45:14,412 --> 00:45:16,347
What are you doing here,
yardley?

692
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:19,084
You got a shitload
of explaining to do, son.

693
00:45:19,117 --> 00:45:21,386
May I ask what your
official business is here?

694
00:45:21,419 --> 00:45:24,990
My official business
here, son,

695
00:45:25,023 --> 00:45:27,392
is to ask you
why there's a bunch of mps

696
00:45:27,425 --> 00:45:30,095
haulin' furniture
out of an off-post residence

697
00:45:30,128 --> 00:45:31,368
that belongs
to a murder victim.

698
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:34,365
The family of the deceased,
chief yardley,

699
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:36,367
asked me to take charge
of those items

700
00:45:36,401 --> 00:45:38,904
and transport them here.

701
00:45:38,937 --> 00:45:40,414
Sunhill, remind me
to call general Campbell

702
00:45:40,438 --> 00:45:42,507
and suggest that I take
charge of those items

703
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:43,909
and transport them here.

704
00:45:43,942 --> 00:45:44,910
You got it.

705
00:45:44,943 --> 00:45:46,311
Jesus, Paul.

706
00:45:46,344 --> 00:45:47,554
You know what you need,
chief yardley,

707
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:48,980
if you don't mind my saying,

708
00:45:49,014 --> 00:45:51,116
is a pair of them
mirrored sunglasses,

709
00:45:51,149 --> 00:45:52,250
for you
and the little one.

710
00:45:52,283 --> 00:45:54,953
That'd really
complete the picture.

711
00:46:01,192 --> 00:46:03,161
So...

712
00:46:03,194 --> 00:46:04,863
Did you ever marry,
uh...

713
00:46:04,896 --> 00:46:07,165
Major what's-his-name
with the gun?

714
00:46:07,198 --> 00:46:09,067
Yes, I did.

715
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,435
Oh...

716
00:46:10,468 --> 00:46:11,536
Congratulations.

717
00:46:11,569 --> 00:46:13,504
I'm extremely happy
for you, Sarah.

718
00:46:13,538 --> 00:46:14,539
And I wish you both

719
00:46:14,572 --> 00:46:16,174
the best that life
has to offer.

720
00:46:16,207 --> 00:46:18,176
I filed for a divorce.

721
00:46:18,209 --> 00:46:19,277
Good.

722
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,989
Thank you.

723
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:34,559
Sunhill:
2 club sodas, please.

724
00:46:41,066 --> 00:46:43,434
Elby: Let's go, boys.

725
00:46:43,468 --> 00:46:45,436
Come on,
i got no place to go!

726
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:47,038
You should
see her record.

727
00:46:47,072 --> 00:46:48,439
Brenner: And there's
your boyfriend

728
00:46:48,473 --> 00:46:50,541
from the
general's house.

729
00:46:50,575 --> 00:46:52,043
Valedictorian
in high school,

730
00:46:52,077 --> 00:46:52,944
super athlete.

731
00:46:52,978 --> 00:46:55,480
She picked west point,
like her daddy did.

732
00:46:55,513 --> 00:46:57,015
Brenner:
Now there's a guy

733
00:46:57,048 --> 00:46:59,184
who knows how
to have a good time.

734
00:46:59,217 --> 00:47:02,153
Paul, look at me.

735
00:47:02,187 --> 00:47:03,454
Ahem.

736
00:47:03,488 --> 00:47:05,456
I think something
happened to her there.

737
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:07,458
Elisabeth Campbell
was tops in her class,

738
00:47:07,492 --> 00:47:09,460
and she went all to shit
her sophomore year.

739
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:11,496
She barely
got through school.

740
00:47:11,529 --> 00:47:13,031
Senior year was better,

741
00:47:13,064 --> 00:47:15,166
and she managed to graduate
and get a degree, but...

742
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,202
She was never
quite the same.

743
00:47:17,235 --> 00:47:18,503
Hmm.

744
00:47:21,372 --> 00:47:23,308
I thought you hated
places like this.

745
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:24,475
I do.

746
00:47:24,509 --> 00:47:28,179
However, the murderer
may be in this room,

747
00:47:28,213 --> 00:47:30,515
sitting all smug
and shiny...

748
00:47:30,548 --> 00:47:32,283
Until we walked in.

749
00:47:32,317 --> 00:47:34,185
And now maybe
he's a little less smug

750
00:47:34,219 --> 00:47:36,087
and a little less shiny.

751
00:47:36,121 --> 00:47:38,223
And that's pretty cool,

752
00:47:38,256 --> 00:47:39,490
don't you think?

753
00:47:42,393 --> 00:47:44,195
What about you?

754
00:47:44,229 --> 00:47:45,496
Oh, I hope Brussels

755
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:47,198
wasn't the last time
you had a woman.

756
00:47:47,232 --> 00:47:48,533
Oh, brother.
Here we go.

757
00:47:48,566 --> 00:47:50,501
You know, I always
thought that you chose

758
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:52,437
to avoid a confrontation
with my fiancé

759
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:54,239
like I wasn't worth
the trouble.

760
00:47:54,272 --> 00:47:55,606
The man threatened
to kill me.

761
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:56,674
I chose discretion.

762
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:58,443
It's the better part
of valor.

763
00:47:58,476 --> 00:48:00,245
Weren't you decorated
for valor?

764
00:48:00,278 --> 00:48:01,512
Oh, please!

765
00:48:01,546 --> 00:48:05,216
Sometimes you just gotta
fight for what you want.

766
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:07,218
That's if you want it.

767
00:48:07,252 --> 00:48:10,255
I received a bronze star
for valor, miss sunhill,

768
00:48:10,288 --> 00:48:11,522
for charging up a hill

769
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:13,925
that I didn't particularly
need or want.

770
00:48:13,959 --> 00:48:14,993
And besides,

771
00:48:15,026 --> 00:48:16,537
I don't remember getting
any encouragement from you.

772
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:18,529
Well, maybe I wanted you
not to accept

773
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:19,998
my decision
to break it off.

774
00:48:20,031 --> 00:48:21,575
Maybe I wanted you to
take me away from him.

775
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,234
So we're talking
about telepathy here,

776
00:48:23,268 --> 00:48:24,535
not communica...

777
00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:26,413
You know, let's just talk
about this next week, ok?

778
00:48:26,437 --> 00:48:28,406
Fine.
Just one more thing.

779
00:48:28,439 --> 00:48:29,707
Is this next week
already?

780
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,010
You are such a goddamn
sharp detective,

781
00:48:32,043 --> 00:48:33,044
aren't you?

782
00:48:33,078 --> 00:48:34,645
But you sure
can't read yourself,

783
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:36,914
and you sure as hell don't
know a thing about women.

784
00:48:39,584 --> 00:48:41,352
You know...

785
00:48:41,386 --> 00:48:43,921
You're very cute
when I'm mad at you.

786
00:48:45,123 --> 00:48:46,357
However...

787
00:48:46,391 --> 00:48:48,426
If you'll excuse me,

788
00:48:48,459 --> 00:48:50,695
I'll take my anger out
on someone else.

789
00:49:07,545 --> 00:49:09,114
Ridiculous behavior
earlier.

790
00:49:09,147 --> 00:49:10,581
I'm sorry.

791
00:49:10,615 --> 00:49:13,184
Well, we didn't exactly
let you see it coming.

792
00:49:13,218 --> 00:49:15,753
Liz was more or less
my protége.

793
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,522
At least,
i like to think she was.

794
00:49:17,555 --> 00:49:18,523
We were...

795
00:49:18,556 --> 00:49:21,592
Very close.

796
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:23,061
Please sit down.

797
00:49:23,094 --> 00:49:25,063
Did you work together
on a daily basis?

798
00:49:25,096 --> 00:49:26,597
Absolutely.

799
00:49:26,631 --> 00:49:29,334
Did you, uh...

800
00:49:29,367 --> 00:49:32,470
Play together?

801
00:49:32,503 --> 00:49:35,540
What a truly
excellent question.

802
00:49:35,573 --> 00:49:36,774
You see,
here at psy ops,

803
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,976
that's one of the things
that we teach...

804
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,779
Threatening quietly.

805
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,548
Think of the echoes

806
00:49:43,581 --> 00:49:45,150
inherent in
those 4 simple words.

807
00:49:45,183 --> 00:49:46,551
"Did you...

808
00:49:46,584 --> 00:49:48,553
Play together?"

809
00:49:48,586 --> 00:49:51,489
Did you go out with her?

810
00:49:51,522 --> 00:49:52,623
Did you fuck her?

811
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:54,625
Did you love her?
If you did...

812
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:57,628
Did you love her so much
that you murdered her?

813
00:49:57,662 --> 00:49:59,730
I meant did you play golf
or tennis

814
00:49:59,764 --> 00:50:01,632
or checkers or something?

815
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:03,368
No, you didn't.

816
00:50:03,401 --> 00:50:05,636
No, I didn't.

817
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:08,539
So now, we both know
we're smart guys.

818
00:50:08,573 --> 00:50:10,641
Do you think
I'm involved in this?

819
00:50:10,675 --> 00:50:12,410
One way or another,
yes, I do.

820
00:50:12,443 --> 00:50:13,544
Then wouldn't it
behoove me

821
00:50:13,578 --> 00:50:14,755
to retain the services
of an attorney?

822
00:50:14,779 --> 00:50:15,746
I know a good one.

823
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:17,548
2 problems there.

824
00:50:17,582 --> 00:50:20,051
First, the obvious.
There are no good ones.

825
00:50:20,085 --> 00:50:21,752
Second...

826
00:50:21,786 --> 00:50:23,454
You're not a civilian,
colonel.

827
00:50:23,488 --> 00:50:24,522
You're in the army.

828
00:50:24,555 --> 00:50:25,799
You have no rights
to an attorney.

829
00:50:25,823 --> 00:50:28,526
You have no right
to remain silent.

830
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,804
And if you don't cooperate,
i may have to put you in jail,

831
00:50:30,828 --> 00:50:32,463
and that would make me
feel bad.

832
00:50:32,497 --> 00:50:34,165
You see what
you're doing here?

833
00:50:34,199 --> 00:50:35,400
Hmm...

834
00:50:35,433 --> 00:50:36,701
Looking for answers?

835
00:50:36,734 --> 00:50:38,736
Of course that. But how?

836
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:41,672
How?

837
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:43,574
You're trying
to make me like you.

838
00:50:43,608 --> 00:50:45,576
And you know what?

839
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:47,812
It's working. I do.

840
00:50:47,845 --> 00:50:50,848
But now do you see
what I'm trying to do?

841
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:53,351
I'm trying to make you
like me, too.

842
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:56,821
Do you like me yet?

843
00:50:56,854 --> 00:50:58,689
Why did you strangle her?

844
00:50:58,723 --> 00:51:01,359
Wrong. Sorry. Not
up to your standards.

845
00:51:04,462 --> 00:51:06,431
Did you go to college?

846
00:51:06,464 --> 00:51:08,199
What do you think?

847
00:51:11,469 --> 00:51:13,571
I think you did not.

848
00:51:13,604 --> 00:51:16,174
Why, did I make a mistake
in grammar?

849
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:18,576
Of course not.

850
00:51:18,609 --> 00:51:19,810
And even if you were to,

851
00:51:19,844 --> 00:51:21,812
I wouldn't be rude
enough to point it out.

852
00:51:21,846 --> 00:51:25,082
No, you have this chip
on your shoulder.

853
00:51:26,351 --> 00:51:27,718
Big one.

854
00:51:27,752 --> 00:51:29,592
Makes you good at your
job, though, doesn't it?

855
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:30,821
I would imagine.

856
00:51:30,855 --> 00:51:32,590
Holds you in good stead

857
00:51:32,623 --> 00:51:34,168
when you see those
commissioned officers,

858
00:51:34,192 --> 00:51:35,726
those spit-and-Polish
college types

859
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,195
just waiting for you.

860
00:51:37,228 --> 00:51:39,197
You're the scoundrel
in the rumpled suit

861
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:40,831
with a healthy disdain
for the rules,

862
00:51:40,865 --> 00:51:42,733
just waiting
to bring them down.

863
00:51:42,767 --> 00:51:44,135
Am I right?

864
00:51:44,169 --> 00:51:45,035
Nah. No.

865
00:51:45,069 --> 00:51:46,747
I'm just here to kick ass,
sleep till noon.

866
00:51:46,771 --> 00:51:49,607
And you cover
your inadequacies

867
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:50,841
with a condescension

868
00:51:50,875 --> 00:51:53,611
for the more robust
individuals around you.

869
00:51:53,644 --> 00:51:54,745
How am I doing?

870
00:51:54,779 --> 00:51:57,448
Not bad. Robust, even.

871
00:51:57,482 --> 00:51:58,783
When did...

872
00:51:58,816 --> 00:52:00,751
The event transpire?

873
00:52:00,785 --> 00:52:02,487
0400, we think.

874
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:03,521
Mmm. See that?

875
00:52:03,554 --> 00:52:04,765
My quick segue
back to the case?

876
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:06,357
Subtle as a chain saw.

877
00:52:06,391 --> 00:52:07,758
And where were you?

878
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:08,926
Snug in bed.

879
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:09,760
Witnesses?

880
00:52:09,794 --> 00:52:12,230
A wife, girlfriend,
roommate, hooker?

881
00:52:12,263 --> 00:52:13,564
I'm divorced.

882
00:52:13,598 --> 00:52:15,800
I'm between girlfriends,
i live alone,

883
00:52:15,833 --> 00:52:18,369
and I do not
use hookers.

884
00:52:18,403 --> 00:52:19,937
I actually have...

885
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,773
Absolutely no alibi
whatsoever.

886
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:24,942
Does that make me
a killer?

887
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,477
No.

888
00:52:26,511 --> 00:52:28,713
Makes you lonely
and unpopular.

889
00:52:28,746 --> 00:52:29,814
Mmm. Very good.

890
00:52:29,847 --> 00:52:31,949
Condescending and..

891
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:32,817
Clever.

892
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:36,187
No. Thank you.

893
00:52:36,221 --> 00:52:37,555
Ok, so...

894
00:52:37,588 --> 00:52:38,789
You called her machine.

895
00:52:38,823 --> 00:52:40,725
You're very concerned.

896
00:52:40,758 --> 00:52:42,327
What was this,
jealousy, perhaps?

897
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,861
Perhaps not.

898
00:52:46,764 --> 00:52:47,965
Liz was my friend.

899
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:50,501
I hadn't heard from her
in a couple of days.

900
00:52:50,535 --> 00:52:51,536
Ahem.

901
00:52:51,569 --> 00:52:52,937
Ok, so as her friend,

902
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:55,840
did you know anyone
that she was involved with?

903
00:52:55,873 --> 00:52:57,508
You mean sexually.

904
00:52:57,542 --> 00:52:58,943
Yes, sexually.

905
00:52:58,976 --> 00:53:00,811
She was seeing someone.

906
00:53:00,845 --> 00:53:02,547
Civilian.

907
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:04,315
A fella named yardley.

908
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:07,184
Police chief yardley?

909
00:53:08,653 --> 00:53:09,954
No.

910
00:53:09,987 --> 00:53:11,589
Nooo.

911
00:53:11,622 --> 00:53:12,823
Ah. Ok.

912
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:14,992
The son. His deputy.

913
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,761
Uh, Wes.

914
00:53:16,794 --> 00:53:18,996
Yes, Wes.
Yes, ok.

915
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,831
Uh, they'd been seeing
each other off and on,

916
00:53:20,865 --> 00:53:22,833
if you'll pardon the pun,
for a few months.

917
00:53:22,867 --> 00:53:25,303
Ok, so look, it's obvious
you were very close to her.

918
00:53:25,336 --> 00:53:27,838
I'm just trying to find out
what "very" means.

919
00:53:27,872 --> 00:53:31,008
It means...

920
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,877
Very.

921
00:53:33,744 --> 00:53:35,446
I was Liz's mentor.

922
00:53:36,581 --> 00:53:39,317
There was a trust...

923
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:40,585
She was, yes,

924
00:53:40,618 --> 00:53:41,586
a passionate
young woman,

925
00:53:41,619 --> 00:53:42,853
as well
she should have been,

926
00:53:42,887 --> 00:53:47,325
but had I ever taken
advantage of that...

927
00:53:48,626 --> 00:53:50,861
I would've
lost the trust.

928
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:53,864
So did I kill her?
Of course not.

929
00:53:53,898 --> 00:53:57,468
Did I love her?

930
00:53:57,502 --> 00:53:59,236
I loved her very much.

931
00:54:02,707 --> 00:54:04,609
Make of that
what you will.

932
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:11,782
Major Briggs,
please report to lab one.

933
00:54:22,927 --> 00:54:25,363
This is what made him
famous, isn't it?

934
00:54:25,396 --> 00:54:27,432
Oh, yeah, yeah.

935
00:54:27,465 --> 00:54:29,834
That's the ledgeworth
city riots.

936
00:54:29,867 --> 00:54:31,902
The whole city
was in chaos.

937
00:54:31,936 --> 00:54:33,338
The general quelled it.

938
00:54:33,371 --> 00:54:35,906
And then he brought in
unarmed troops

939
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,908
and his little daughter

940
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:39,510
just to prove
it was safe.

941
00:54:39,544 --> 00:54:41,812
She looks terrified.

942
00:54:48,486 --> 00:54:50,455
Excellent work.

943
00:54:50,488 --> 00:54:52,923
I'm going to head down
to the morgue.

944
00:54:52,957 --> 00:54:54,725
The report should be in.
You want to come?

945
00:54:54,759 --> 00:54:56,461
Yeah,
we'll meet you there.

946
00:54:56,494 --> 00:54:58,062
I gotta talk to Cal.
Cal!

947
00:54:58,095 --> 00:54:59,530
Coming.

948
00:54:59,564 --> 00:55:00,731
So how's Moore?

949
00:55:01,966 --> 00:55:03,534
Complicated.

950
00:55:03,568 --> 00:55:04,635
Yeah?

951
00:55:04,669 --> 00:55:05,836
Cal.

952
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:07,705
We got the dog tag latents
back from the lab.

953
00:55:07,738 --> 00:55:08,939
Partial prints

954
00:55:08,973 --> 00:55:10,813
belong to somebody other
than captain Campbell.

955
00:55:10,841 --> 00:55:11,809
Who's that?

956
00:55:11,842 --> 00:55:14,111
Robert Moore.

957
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:16,313
Hello.

958
00:55:27,492 --> 00:55:29,994
Smells good.

959
00:55:34,932 --> 00:55:36,434
What are
you doing here?

960
00:55:36,467 --> 00:55:38,769
I'm here to ask you
a question, Bobby.

961
00:55:38,803 --> 00:55:39,970
Huh.

962
00:55:40,004 --> 00:55:42,607
And the question is?

963
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:46,076
Why...

964
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:47,978
Were you so stupid...

965
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:50,881
As to leave your
fingerprints everywhere?

966
00:55:52,016 --> 00:55:53,984
My answer, you panicked.

967
00:55:54,018 --> 00:55:55,853
I teach panic, remember?

968
00:55:55,886 --> 00:55:57,021
And?

969
00:55:57,054 --> 00:55:58,131
Well, obviously,
i didn't plan for things

970
00:55:58,155 --> 00:55:59,990
to work out this way.

971
00:56:00,024 --> 00:56:00,991
Define "things."

972
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:03,994
Look, Paul...

973
00:56:04,028 --> 00:56:05,630
May I call you Paul?

974
00:56:05,663 --> 00:56:06,597
I so enjoyed it

975
00:56:06,631 --> 00:56:08,599
when you took the Liberty
of calling me Bobby.

976
00:56:08,633 --> 00:56:11,769
We are, I assume, still trying
to outsmart each other.

977
00:56:11,802 --> 00:56:13,471
Obviously, Paul...

978
00:56:13,504 --> 00:56:15,906
I cannot tell a lie
and say...

979
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:17,775
I know nothing
about all of this.

980
00:56:17,808 --> 00:56:19,009
Ahh.

981
00:56:20,778 --> 00:56:22,913
I also, sadly...

982
00:56:22,947 --> 00:56:24,615
Cannot tell the truth.

983
00:56:24,649 --> 00:56:27,552
'Cause you think silence
will save your ass.

984
00:56:27,585 --> 00:56:29,954
My ass, as you
so delicately put it,

985
00:56:29,987 --> 00:56:32,790
is already in a sling,
is it not?

986
00:56:32,823 --> 00:56:35,593
You mean the sex tapes.

987
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:44,835
You're good.

988
00:56:44,869 --> 00:56:48,038
Hmm. You're good.

989
00:56:48,072 --> 00:56:49,507
Great question.

990
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:51,084
Almost any answer
incriminates me, doesn't it?

991
00:56:51,108 --> 00:56:53,043
Yep. That's
why I like it.

992
00:56:53,077 --> 00:56:54,912
Yeah, so let's cut
the bullshit.

993
00:56:54,945 --> 00:56:56,046
Let's do that.

994
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,848
We both know
I'm pretty much destroyed,

995
00:56:57,882 --> 00:56:58,983
don't we?

996
00:56:59,016 --> 00:57:01,051
Can you think of
any compelling reason

997
00:57:01,085 --> 00:57:04,088
why Elisabeth should be
destroyed along with me?

998
00:57:05,623 --> 00:57:06,757
Can you?

999
00:57:06,791 --> 00:57:09,426
I can't... Paul.

1000
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:15,800
I watched the two of you...

1001
00:57:15,833 --> 00:57:17,802
On one of her tapes.

1002
00:57:20,905 --> 00:57:22,072
I don't think so.

1003
00:57:22,106 --> 00:57:24,008
You know, bluffing is
the last desperate act

1004
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:26,944
of the weak, Paul.

1005
00:57:26,977 --> 00:57:29,079
I'll not help you
ruin that girl.

1006
00:57:29,113 --> 00:57:30,681
She's suffered enough.

1007
00:57:30,715 --> 00:57:32,082
Leave it there.

1008
00:57:32,116 --> 00:57:34,519
I'm all you've got.

1009
00:57:36,053 --> 00:57:37,087
Wrong again.

1010
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:39,890
Hello, captain.

1011
00:57:39,924 --> 00:57:41,225
Hello.

1012
00:57:41,258 --> 00:57:43,103
Captain goodson is with
the judge advocate's office.

1013
00:57:43,127 --> 00:57:45,229
He's also my lawyer.

1014
00:57:45,262 --> 00:57:47,532
Anything you have to say
to colonel Moore...

1015
00:57:47,565 --> 00:57:50,234
I'll say
to colonel Moore.

1016
00:57:50,267 --> 00:57:52,202
Don't think you can
bully my client.

1017
00:57:52,236 --> 00:57:53,838
You know,
I'm done bullying.

1018
00:57:53,871 --> 00:57:55,973
You're under arrest,
Bobby. Come here.

1019
00:57:56,006 --> 00:57:57,207
Conduct unbecoming
an officer.

1020
00:57:57,241 --> 00:57:59,043
Plus article 1-34,

1021
00:57:59,076 --> 00:58:01,111
disorderly
and neglect,

1022
00:58:01,145 --> 00:58:03,047
accessory after the fact,
conspiracy,

1023
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,982
making false statements,
and...

1024
00:58:05,015 --> 00:58:07,151
Captain, you are the verge
of article 98,

1025
00:58:07,184 --> 00:58:10,054
noncompliance
with procedural rules.

1026
00:58:13,858 --> 00:58:15,826
Can I help you, ma'am?

1027
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,161
Just taking another look.

1028
00:58:17,194 --> 00:58:18,663
Go ahead, ma'am.

1029
00:58:18,696 --> 00:58:19,797
Thank you.

1030
00:58:40,217 --> 00:58:43,788
Is it possible the bag
holding the victim's clothes

1031
00:58:43,821 --> 00:58:46,857
was going to be picked up
by her killer

1032
00:58:46,891 --> 00:58:49,159
or by a third party?

1033
00:58:49,193 --> 00:58:51,528
Radio: 5-Charlie,
do you copy?

1034
00:58:54,131 --> 00:58:56,667
This is 5-Charlie.

1035
00:59:05,209 --> 00:59:10,314
Maybe she was here
for a secret rendezvous...

1036
00:59:10,347 --> 00:59:11,816
A tryst.

1037
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:16,553
Maybe the rape fantasy
was part of the thrill.

1038
00:59:17,354 --> 00:59:19,189
We all know
she had a predilection

1039
00:59:19,223 --> 00:59:21,258
for the gamier side of sex.

1040
00:59:22,693 --> 00:59:24,995
Is there anything
to the argument

1041
00:59:25,029 --> 00:59:26,230
that Elisabeth Campbell
picked

1042
00:59:26,263 --> 00:59:27,674
what amounted to
a nearly public place

1043
00:59:27,698 --> 00:59:29,934
because it presented
an element of...

1044
00:59:38,843 --> 00:59:40,711
Fuck.

1045
00:59:40,745 --> 00:59:42,579
Aah!

1046
00:59:47,818 --> 00:59:49,954
Hold that bitch down.
Let me get in there.

1047
00:59:51,722 --> 00:59:53,090
This is the army.

1048
00:59:53,123 --> 00:59:54,358
So you tell brenner,

1049
00:59:54,391 --> 00:59:56,961
you don't shit
on your brothers.

1050
00:59:58,295 --> 01:00:01,699
Rape investigator, huh?

1051
01:00:01,732 --> 01:00:03,868
Want to know
what it feels like? Huh?

1052
01:00:03,901 --> 01:00:08,038
Maybe it'll make you better
at your job, huh?

1053
01:00:08,072 --> 01:00:10,607
Huh? Huh?

1054
01:00:32,830 --> 01:00:33,931
Number 5.

1055
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:39,169
Got yourself a colonel
this time, huh?

1056
01:00:39,203 --> 01:00:42,006
Shut up, elkins.

1057
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:45,375
Aah.

1058
01:00:45,409 --> 01:00:47,053
You were acting as her shrink,
were you not?

1059
01:00:47,077 --> 01:00:49,213
Were you not?!

1060
01:00:49,246 --> 01:00:52,983
The Elisabeth I met
was bright and shiny.

1061
01:00:53,017 --> 01:00:54,919
The woman on the tape
is a different lady...

1062
01:00:54,952 --> 01:00:57,087
And there's a direct
connection, isn't there?

1063
01:00:57,121 --> 01:01:00,290
Isn't there?

1064
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:03,027
Are you going to pull
my fingernails out now?

1065
01:01:20,978 --> 01:01:23,313
What happened sophomore year
at the point?

1066
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:36,060
You're a murderer
or an accessory to murder.

1067
01:01:36,093 --> 01:01:38,428
Either way, you're gonna
get burned at the stake.

1068
01:01:38,462 --> 01:01:40,697
Nobody's gonna bail you out!

1069
01:01:42,132 --> 01:01:44,368
Moore: It was awful.

1070
01:01:50,174 --> 01:01:52,009
It was awful. Go ahead.

1071
01:01:54,845 --> 01:01:58,148
What, she violated a code?
She cheated? She lied? What?

1072
01:01:58,182 --> 01:01:59,516
Worse.

1073
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:00,517
Drugs.

1074
01:02:02,119 --> 01:02:03,153
Worse.

1075
01:02:03,187 --> 01:02:04,488
Rape.

1076
01:02:13,798 --> 01:02:14,531
Worse.

1077
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:17,367
What's worse than rape?

1078
01:02:17,401 --> 01:02:20,370
When you find that out...

1079
01:02:20,404 --> 01:02:23,073
Then you'll know everything,
won't you?

1080
01:02:49,433 --> 01:02:52,136
Tell me what the hell
happened, bill?

1081
01:02:52,169 --> 01:02:53,403
Look, I'm sorry, Paul,

1082
01:02:53,437 --> 01:02:56,140
but the mp claims he got
a call to leave his post.

1083
01:02:56,173 --> 01:02:57,413
I've got no record
of that call.

1084
01:02:57,441 --> 01:02:59,944
Probably a dead end,
but I'm gonna take it further.

1085
01:02:59,977 --> 01:03:03,213
I'm pulling up.
Talk to me later.

1086
01:03:03,247 --> 01:03:04,581
She's fine,
Paul.

1087
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:05,415
I'm ok.

1088
01:03:05,449 --> 01:03:07,784
Who did it?

1089
01:03:19,496 --> 01:03:21,832
Stupid play, elby.

1090
01:03:21,866 --> 01:03:23,200
Rookie move.

1091
01:03:23,233 --> 01:03:25,045
Should remember to take off
all identifying jewelry

1092
01:03:25,069 --> 01:03:26,270
before an attack.

1093
01:03:26,303 --> 01:03:27,480
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1094
01:03:27,504 --> 01:03:30,374
I told you I was in
the "o" club all night.

1095
01:03:30,407 --> 01:03:33,143
She's crazy,
and you're crazy.

1096
01:03:33,177 --> 01:03:35,379
Aah! You burnt me.

1097
01:03:35,412 --> 01:03:36,914
Sorry.

1098
01:03:36,947 --> 01:03:37,882
What the fuck?!

1099
01:03:37,915 --> 01:03:40,384
You just can't get good
styrofoam these days.

1100
01:03:40,417 --> 01:03:41,986
Ok, let's change
the subject.

1101
01:03:42,019 --> 01:03:44,955
What can you tell me about
captain Elisabeth Campbell?

1102
01:03:46,290 --> 01:03:48,158
What about her?

1103
01:03:48,192 --> 01:03:50,427
She was raped
and killed.

1104
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:51,628
You know what rape
usually is?

1105
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:55,099
It's a woman who changes
her mind afterward.

1106
01:03:57,201 --> 01:03:58,468
Would you classify

1107
01:03:58,502 --> 01:04:00,470
your relationship
with Elisabeth Campbell

1108
01:04:00,504 --> 01:04:02,172
as an intimate one?

1109
01:04:02,206 --> 01:04:04,341
You mean
was I fucking her?

1110
01:04:04,374 --> 01:04:05,642
Yeah, that is what I mean.

1111
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:07,644
Yeah.

1112
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:08,612
I was.

1113
01:04:08,645 --> 01:04:10,314
But that was all
i took it for.

1114
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:11,481
Just some
sport fucking.

1115
01:04:11,515 --> 01:04:13,183
I didn't think she'd
run off and tell him.

1116
01:04:13,217 --> 01:04:14,484
Tell who?

1117
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:16,586
The general. The bitch
told the general.

1118
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:17,421
Why?

1119
01:04:17,454 --> 01:04:18,422
Because
she's a freak,

1120
01:04:18,455 --> 01:04:19,623
and that's
what freaks do!

1121
01:04:19,656 --> 01:04:21,625
What about the general
and captain Campbell?

1122
01:04:21,658 --> 01:04:23,293
Were they close? No.

1123
01:04:23,327 --> 01:04:24,361
Why not?

1124
01:04:24,394 --> 01:04:25,930
I don't know.
You like your dad?

1125
01:04:25,963 --> 01:04:28,098
My dad was a drunk,
a gambler, and a womanizer.

1126
01:04:28,132 --> 01:04:29,499
I worshipped him.

1127
01:04:29,533 --> 01:04:32,669
Yeah, well, I think
I've said enough.

1128
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:33,938
Aah.

1129
01:04:33,971 --> 01:04:34,838
You cooperate,

1130
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:37,174
and maybe we'll keep it
out of the report.

1131
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:42,379
You guys don't get it.
With Elisabeth gone,

1132
01:04:42,412 --> 01:04:43,556
the general has got
a clear field

1133
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:45,549
to settle some scores.

1134
01:04:47,551 --> 01:04:49,519
And I'll be given

1135
01:04:49,553 --> 01:04:51,688
the opportunity
to resign.

1136
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:53,991
Maybe I can save
my marriage,

1137
01:04:54,024 --> 01:04:54,992
maybe I can't.

1138
01:04:55,025 --> 01:04:56,360
Oh, great.
There's a Mrs. elby.

1139
01:04:56,393 --> 01:04:57,928
And what does she do,

1140
01:04:57,962 --> 01:04:59,705
aside from wake up in the
middle of the night screaming?

1141
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:02,332
What do you mean
by settle some scores?

1142
01:05:02,366 --> 01:05:03,709
Look, I told you,
i am done talking!

1143
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:06,170
Hey, we just
got started, elby.

1144
01:05:06,203 --> 01:05:08,538
I'm gonna bring you
up on charges

1145
01:05:08,572 --> 01:05:10,307
for the assault
on agent sunhill.

1146
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:12,242
See how you like
40 years of sport fucking

1147
01:05:12,276 --> 01:05:14,678
in a military prison.

1148
01:05:14,711 --> 01:05:16,480
Aah!

1149
01:05:16,513 --> 01:05:20,017
Brenner: Ok. Dare me.

1150
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:21,385
Go ahead, motherfucker.
Dare me.

1151
01:05:22,586 --> 01:05:24,454
I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

1152
01:05:24,488 --> 01:05:27,091
What do you mean
by settle some scores?

1153
01:05:27,124 --> 01:05:29,926
Ok. Ok, ok, ok!

1154
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:38,268
When she was alive...

1155
01:05:40,537 --> 01:05:42,739
He couldn't touch her...

1156
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:45,242
Without embarrassing
himself.

1157
01:05:46,543 --> 01:05:48,945
He couldn't touch
any of us...

1158
01:05:50,247 --> 01:05:53,317
'Cause he knew
she would spill all.

1159
01:05:53,350 --> 01:05:54,518
All?

1160
01:05:54,551 --> 01:05:55,752
I mean...

1161
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:58,155
Imagine what
it would look like...

1162
01:05:58,188 --> 01:05:59,589
The general's
daughter

1163
01:05:59,623 --> 01:06:01,525
banging his entire
male staff.

1164
01:06:01,558 --> 01:06:02,759
Entire
male staff?

1165
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,594
Yeah. Yeah.
Everybody.

1166
01:06:04,628 --> 01:06:06,463
Well, at least
most of them.

1167
01:06:06,496 --> 01:06:08,598
What about
the sheriff's son?

1168
01:06:08,632 --> 01:06:12,136
No. That was
just for show.

1169
01:06:12,169 --> 01:06:13,537
She was pulling

1170
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:14,747
the longest military
train imaginable.

1171
01:06:14,771 --> 01:06:16,206
Right up the chain.

1172
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:17,783
She went through most
of the general's staff,

1173
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:19,609
plus the staff
of the judge advocate

1174
01:06:19,643 --> 01:06:21,745
and people like me
in key positions.

1175
01:06:21,778 --> 01:06:23,480
What about colonel Fowler?

1176
01:06:23,513 --> 01:06:26,550
Colonel Fowler
once told me...

1177
01:06:26,583 --> 01:06:28,785
He knew
all about this

1178
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:31,555
and that I was
part of the problem.

1179
01:06:31,588 --> 01:06:34,158
I think he meant
that he wasn't.

1180
01:06:34,191 --> 01:06:36,660
What do you think
about this, agent sunhill?

1181
01:06:36,693 --> 01:06:38,428
I think it's insane.

1182
01:06:38,462 --> 01:06:39,629
Not really.

1183
01:06:39,663 --> 01:06:41,798
Elisabeth
once told me

1184
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:44,568
she was conducting
a field experiment

1185
01:06:44,601 --> 01:06:46,803
in psychological
warfare...

1186
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:50,140
And that the enemy
was daddy.

1187
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:56,680
You ok?

1188
01:06:56,713 --> 01:06:58,182
Yeah.
I've been better.

1189
01:06:58,215 --> 01:06:59,116
God, Paul.

1190
01:06:59,149 --> 01:07:00,517
I know, I know.

1191
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:01,827
Most of these officers
are married.

1192
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:04,588
It's immediate grounds
for court-martial.

1193
01:07:04,621 --> 01:07:06,523
Their lives are over.

1194
01:07:06,556 --> 01:07:07,791
But I'll tell you this,

1195
01:07:07,824 --> 01:07:09,793
it's a hell of a motive
for murder.

1196
01:07:09,826 --> 01:07:11,528
How does it feel
to have our suspect list

1197
01:07:11,561 --> 01:07:13,163
multiply exponentially?

1198
01:07:13,197 --> 01:07:14,840
Well, at least we know who
the guys were on the tapes.

1199
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:17,201
Yeah. A bunch of creeps
willing to risk it all

1200
01:07:17,234 --> 01:07:18,668
for a piece of patch.

1201
01:07:18,702 --> 01:07:20,670
A piece of patch?

1202
01:07:20,704 --> 01:07:21,671
Sorry, darling.

1203
01:07:21,705 --> 01:07:23,207
I just get
back on the base,

1204
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:26,276
and it drudges up all
my old Alpha male behavior.

1205
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:27,344
Great.
What's next?

1206
01:07:27,377 --> 01:07:29,579
You gonna do a beer funnel
and light your own farts?

1207
01:07:29,613 --> 01:07:30,680
Maybe.

1208
01:07:30,714 --> 01:07:32,182
After we see Moore.

1209
01:07:32,216 --> 01:07:33,350
Oh, I can't wait.

1210
01:07:35,719 --> 01:07:37,321
Where is he?

1211
01:07:39,189 --> 01:07:40,590
Bill...

1212
01:07:40,624 --> 01:07:41,591
Where's Moore?

1213
01:07:41,625 --> 01:07:43,427
Uh, he was released.

1214
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:44,428
What?

1215
01:07:44,461 --> 01:07:45,562
Restricted
to quarters.

1216
01:07:45,595 --> 01:07:47,164
On whose orders?

1217
01:07:47,197 --> 01:07:49,599
On mine. Looked like he was
having a damn heart attack.

1218
01:07:49,633 --> 01:07:51,177
His lawyer came in,
had a valid complaint.

1219
01:07:51,201 --> 01:07:53,603
You can't put an officer
in common lockup.

1220
01:07:53,637 --> 01:07:55,539
He's a murder suspect,
bill!

1221
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:56,706
Since when?

1222
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:58,708
His prints are all over
the goddamn tags.

1223
01:07:58,742 --> 01:08:00,753
Well, you never informed us
he was a murder suspect.

1224
01:08:00,777 --> 01:08:04,314
He was being held here
for conduct unbecoming,

1225
01:08:04,348 --> 01:08:06,183
not murder.

1226
01:08:06,216 --> 01:08:07,717
I had no choice.

1227
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:09,453
I had no choice.
Bill...

1228
01:08:46,656 --> 01:08:47,757
Moore!

1229
01:09:07,677 --> 01:09:09,279
Brenner: Moore!

1230
01:09:23,527 --> 01:09:25,161
I'm going in.

1231
01:09:39,709 --> 01:09:41,245
Aah.

1232
01:10:15,612 --> 01:10:18,348
Oh, my god.

1233
01:10:48,645 --> 01:10:49,889
The organics
on Elisabeth Campbell

1234
01:10:49,913 --> 01:10:50,880
came back.

1235
01:10:50,914 --> 01:10:53,350
There was
no sign of rape.

1236
01:10:54,384 --> 01:10:55,819
What are your
thoughts on this?

1237
01:10:55,852 --> 01:10:56,886
Apparent suicide.

1238
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:59,389
Star pattern,
close-contact wound.

1239
01:10:59,423 --> 01:11:01,891
And I don't buy it.

1240
01:11:01,925 --> 01:11:03,427
Well, I'll do a U.V.

1241
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:05,429
And check his hands
for gunpowder residue.

1242
01:11:05,462 --> 01:11:08,332
I'll let you know if
i find any inconsistencies.

1243
01:11:12,469 --> 01:11:13,970
Colonel Kent!

1244
01:11:14,871 --> 01:11:16,272
Yeah?

1245
01:11:18,942 --> 01:11:20,444
Were you aware

1246
01:11:20,477 --> 01:11:23,913
of Elisabeth Campbell's
extracurricular activities?

1247
01:11:23,947 --> 01:11:24,914
How do you mean?

1248
01:11:24,948 --> 01:11:27,384
You know what I mean.

1249
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:30,554
Uh...

1250
01:11:30,587 --> 01:11:31,855
Uh...

1251
01:11:31,888 --> 01:11:33,623
Well...

1252
01:11:33,657 --> 01:11:35,625
There were...
There were rumors,

1253
01:11:35,659 --> 01:11:36,860
uh, innuendo.

1254
01:11:36,893 --> 01:11:40,397
I always took it
as false bravado.

1255
01:11:40,430 --> 01:11:42,632
Soldiers bragging,
that sort of thing,

1256
01:11:42,666 --> 01:11:43,800
but, uh...

1257
01:11:43,833 --> 01:11:46,302
Well, there was more to it
than that.

1258
01:11:47,837 --> 01:11:50,039
Mr. brenner.

1259
01:11:50,073 --> 01:11:52,108
As soon as
you're through here,

1260
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:54,110
we'll convene
at the general's house

1261
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:56,880
to coordinate the release
of the official findings.

1262
01:11:56,913 --> 01:11:58,582
What are you
talking about?

1263
01:11:58,615 --> 01:12:01,751
Obviously Moore
was overwhelmed with guilt.

1264
01:12:01,785 --> 01:12:03,953
We need to close up shop.

1265
01:12:03,987 --> 01:12:06,590
Determine what evidence
should be classified,

1266
01:12:06,623 --> 01:12:07,857
release a statement

1267
01:12:07,891 --> 01:12:09,131
about Moore's guilt
and suicide.

1268
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:11,961
You don't understand,
colonel Fowler.

1269
01:12:11,995 --> 01:12:13,863
This is
my investigation,

1270
01:12:13,897 --> 01:12:16,099
and it's still open.

1271
01:12:16,132 --> 01:12:19,135
Who the hell
do you think you are?

1272
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:20,704
It's over.

1273
01:12:20,737 --> 01:12:22,406
Over.

1274
01:12:22,439 --> 01:12:25,008
You'd better start thinking
about your career, understand?

1275
01:12:25,041 --> 01:12:27,977
And you better start
thinking about yours.

1276
01:12:28,011 --> 01:12:30,514
You are running
one lunatic base here.

1277
01:12:30,547 --> 01:12:32,716
You want to mess
with me, colonel?

1278
01:12:35,051 --> 01:12:37,654
Let's start
gouging away.

1279
01:12:44,027 --> 01:12:46,362
You've been warned.

1280
01:12:54,504 --> 01:12:55,138
Move out.

1281
01:12:55,171 --> 01:12:56,473
Soldier:
Yes, sir.

1282
01:12:56,506 --> 01:12:58,007
Huh? Huh?

1283
01:12:58,041 --> 01:12:59,943
What are you doing here,
yardley?

1284
01:13:01,845 --> 01:13:03,012
Shouldn't you be out

1285
01:13:03,046 --> 01:13:04,380
nightsticking
the colored folk?

1286
01:13:06,049 --> 01:13:08,418
Wait in the car.
I want to talk to him.

1287
01:13:08,452 --> 01:13:09,619
All right.

1288
01:13:09,653 --> 01:13:11,020
Your son Wes,

1289
01:13:11,054 --> 01:13:13,957
we gotta speak to him.

1290
01:13:13,990 --> 01:13:16,025
Apparently he was involved
with the victim,

1291
01:13:16,059 --> 01:13:18,127
but you neglected
to mention that to us.

1292
01:13:18,161 --> 01:13:20,830
Yardley: He was on duty
when it happened.

1293
01:13:20,864 --> 01:13:22,198
His partner
can verify it.

1294
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:24,634
And we got tapes
of his radio calls

1295
01:13:24,668 --> 01:13:26,903
all night long.

1296
01:13:26,936 --> 01:13:29,405
Just the same,
we'll be in touch.

1297
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:32,408
Good night.

1298
01:13:33,677 --> 01:13:35,411
Asshole.

1299
01:13:43,987 --> 01:13:45,154
What is that?

1300
01:13:45,188 --> 01:13:47,891
The gods have smiled on you,
Paul brenner.

1301
01:13:47,924 --> 01:13:49,225
Oh, yeah?
Why is that?

1302
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:51,661
Because it's a west point
psychological report

1303
01:13:51,695 --> 01:13:52,428
on Elisabeth Campbell

1304
01:13:52,462 --> 01:13:54,063
and pages
from her medical file...

1305
01:13:54,097 --> 01:13:55,765
Pages we were never given.

1306
01:13:55,799 --> 01:13:57,501
Well, what does it say?

1307
01:13:57,534 --> 01:14:01,437
It says we're going
to west point.

1308
01:14:11,915 --> 01:14:13,449
Yes?

1309
01:14:14,884 --> 01:14:16,820
Sunhill: Brenner
and sunhill, sir.

1310
01:14:16,853 --> 01:14:18,622
Come in, come in.

1311
01:14:18,655 --> 01:14:20,657
And talk loud.

1312
01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:22,992
Terrible thing
for a shrink to lose.

1313
01:14:23,026 --> 01:14:25,094
Can't hear some of my
patients half the time.

1314
01:14:25,128 --> 01:14:27,130
Course, considering
some of my patients,

1315
01:14:27,163 --> 01:14:29,999
maybe it's a blessing.

1316
01:14:30,033 --> 01:14:31,267
Colonel slesinger...

1317
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:34,137
Would you prefer being
called colonel or doctor?

1318
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:36,740
I prefer Donald,
and I'm assuming

1319
01:14:36,773 --> 01:14:39,108
you didn't fly up from
maccullum to bullshit.

1320
01:14:39,142 --> 01:14:41,678
No, sir. It's what
i told you on the phone.

1321
01:14:41,711 --> 01:14:44,147
Yes, and I told you
on the phone

1322
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:47,150
that I can't talk about
captain Campbell.

1323
01:14:47,183 --> 01:14:48,818
Nothing has changed.

1324
01:14:48,852 --> 01:14:50,820
You were her psychiatrist?

1325
01:14:50,854 --> 01:14:52,589
And a poor one at that.

1326
01:14:52,622 --> 01:14:54,724
Well, she was, uh...

1327
01:14:54,758 --> 01:14:57,160
At the end of her sophomore year
when she came to see you.

1328
01:14:57,193 --> 01:14:58,662
She must have been about 20.

1329
01:14:58,695 --> 01:15:01,598
She was in
a serious depression.

1330
01:15:01,631 --> 01:15:03,600
I take it from
your presence here

1331
01:15:03,633 --> 01:15:04,934
Lizzie's in
some trouble again.

1332
01:15:04,968 --> 01:15:06,636
Not now.

1333
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:08,504
That's good.

1334
01:15:09,706 --> 01:15:13,176
Well, she's too young
to be dead.

1335
01:15:19,182 --> 01:15:22,251
Sunhill: She was
strangled, sir.

1336
01:15:22,285 --> 01:15:24,721
Mock raped
and then strangled.

1337
01:15:37,333 --> 01:15:40,169
God damn it! God damn it!

1338
01:15:40,203 --> 01:15:43,640
I couldn't help her,
don't you see?

1339
01:15:43,673 --> 01:15:44,608
I tried...

1340
01:15:44,641 --> 01:15:48,211
But I could not unlock
her enough to trust me.

1341
01:15:48,244 --> 01:15:50,980
But you know what?

1342
01:15:51,014 --> 01:15:53,316
I still can't talk
about her.

1343
01:15:54,951 --> 01:15:56,552
Sunhill: No, you can't.

1344
01:15:58,021 --> 01:16:00,056
But you're angry, yes?

1345
01:16:00,089 --> 01:16:02,325
Of course.

1346
01:16:02,358 --> 01:16:06,830
Sometimes when I'm angry,
i talk to myself out loud.

1347
01:16:06,863 --> 01:16:08,197
Do you ever do that?

1348
01:16:08,231 --> 01:16:10,634
Just sort of... rant?

1349
01:16:15,972 --> 01:16:17,941
Yes.

1350
01:16:17,974 --> 01:16:20,576
Sometimes.

1351
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:24,380
Well, if you were to rant

1352
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:27,216
and we happened to be
in the vicinity...

1353
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:28,918
Free country.

1354
01:16:28,952 --> 01:16:31,587
That's my thoughts exactly.

1355
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:37,694
She sets a place on fire,
our Lizzie does.

1356
01:16:37,727 --> 01:16:40,263
Top woman here.

1357
01:16:40,296 --> 01:16:43,166
Pretty as hell.

1358
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:45,969
Outdoes most of the men
in the training runs.

1359
01:16:46,002 --> 01:16:50,774
At the end
of her sophomore year,

1360
01:16:50,807 --> 01:16:54,243
there was
a big night exercise.

1361
01:16:54,277 --> 01:16:56,612
Must've been
thousands involved.

1362
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:05,288
Lizzie got separated
from her group.

1363
01:17:10,827 --> 01:17:13,629
Found herself with about
a half a dozen men.

1364
01:17:26,843 --> 01:17:29,278
A very dark night.

1365
01:17:29,312 --> 01:17:32,281
Not only were the men
unknown to her...

1366
01:17:32,315 --> 01:17:36,652
But they were also
wearing camouflage.

1367
01:17:38,021 --> 01:17:40,389
They raped her
almost to death.

1368
01:17:40,423 --> 01:17:43,760
Raped her all night long.

1369
01:17:43,793 --> 01:17:46,195
Taking turns.

1370
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:49,198
Stripped her...

1371
01:17:49,232 --> 01:17:51,801
Spread-eagled her...

1372
01:17:58,341 --> 01:18:01,344
Nailed her to the earth
with tent pegs.

1373
01:18:01,377 --> 01:18:04,247
Just had
a whale of a time.

1374
01:18:11,955 --> 01:18:13,990
Threatened to kill her
if she talked.

1375
01:18:15,391 --> 01:18:19,095
Tied her underwear
around her throat?

1376
01:18:19,128 --> 01:18:20,463
Yes.

1377
01:19:11,414 --> 01:19:14,117
Slesinger:
Lizzie was hospitalized,

1378
01:19:14,150 --> 01:19:17,386
treated
for venereal disease,

1379
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:19,522
treated for pregnancy.

1380
01:19:39,075 --> 01:19:44,313
By the time I got to her,
she had gone away inside.

1381
01:19:44,347 --> 01:19:46,215
Never let me get close.

1382
01:19:46,249 --> 01:19:48,051
Who were these guys?

1383
01:19:48,084 --> 01:19:50,286
No.
I need a name.

1384
01:19:50,319 --> 01:19:53,923
Sorry. Medical ethics.

1385
01:19:57,093 --> 01:19:59,528
I am gonna finish
my work here.

1386
01:19:59,562 --> 01:20:02,365
I can't tell you
what to do,

1387
01:20:02,398 --> 01:20:04,968
but if you were to go
back to my office...

1388
01:20:05,001 --> 01:20:06,602
Key's under the mat...

1389
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:09,038
And you were to look up
Lizzie's files,

1390
01:20:09,072 --> 01:20:10,173
you might find

1391
01:20:10,206 --> 01:20:11,440
an additional
notation there

1392
01:20:11,474 --> 01:20:13,209
with a man's name on it.

1393
01:20:13,242 --> 01:20:17,546
Might be worth your while
to snoop. Up to you.

1394
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:19,615
Free country and all that.

1395
01:20:23,486 --> 01:20:26,022
Sorry I couldn't
be of any help.

1396
01:20:33,029 --> 01:20:35,965
Beginning our descent
to fort benning, ma'am.

1397
01:20:52,982 --> 01:20:55,351
Instructor: Pick it up!
Get them outta the water!

1398
01:20:55,384 --> 01:20:57,620
Now! Now! Ranger!
Let's go!

1399
01:20:57,653 --> 01:20:59,222
We ain't got all day!

1400
01:20:59,255 --> 01:21:01,490
Female on the floor!

1401
01:21:01,524 --> 01:21:03,426
Soldier:
Female on the floor!

1402
01:21:03,459 --> 01:21:06,129
Second soldier:
Female on the floor!

1403
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,535
Captain bransford?

1404
01:21:12,568 --> 01:21:15,504
Whoa. Yeah,
that would be me.

1405
01:21:15,538 --> 01:21:17,306
What can I do
for you, honey?

1406
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:20,276
Better yet,
what can you do for me?

1407
01:21:21,577 --> 01:21:23,112
Well, dear,

1408
01:21:23,146 --> 01:21:26,049
you can ask these
other men to excuse us.

1409
01:21:26,082 --> 01:21:28,985
Yeah, that's a cid badge
you're looking at.

1410
01:21:35,591 --> 01:21:37,560
Looks like I picked
the wrong woman to "honey."

1411
01:21:37,593 --> 01:21:39,528
Looks like.

1412
01:21:39,562 --> 01:21:41,297
I'm Sarah sunhill,
captain.

1413
01:21:41,330 --> 01:21:43,132
I'm a rape investigator
for the cid.

1414
01:21:43,166 --> 01:21:46,936
We need to talk about
Elisabeth Campbell.

1415
01:21:46,970 --> 01:21:48,571
Right. Liz.

1416
01:21:48,604 --> 01:21:50,974
Liz and I were classmates
together at the point.

1417
01:21:51,007 --> 01:21:53,909
Mm-hmm. Well, I only
have just one question.

1418
01:21:55,044 --> 01:21:57,913
How scared are you
right now?

1419
01:21:59,182 --> 01:22:01,550
I'm sorry, miss sunhill.

1420
01:22:01,584 --> 01:22:04,253
Is it possible that
you're in the wrong place?

1421
01:22:04,287 --> 01:22:06,555
Your heart's racing
a little faster,

1422
01:22:06,589 --> 01:22:07,732
there's a little ball
in your throat,

1423
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:09,959
it's sticky
under the arms.

1424
01:22:09,993 --> 01:22:11,027
Ok, I think
that's enough.

1425
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:14,463
You can sit
your ass back down.

1426
01:22:20,303 --> 01:22:22,571
I know you weren't
the leader.

1427
01:22:22,605 --> 01:22:24,583
If you say so, miss sunhill,
but I really do not know

1428
01:22:24,607 --> 01:22:26,209
what in the world
you're referring to.

1429
01:22:26,242 --> 01:22:28,144
You're too weak
to have started it.

1430
01:22:28,177 --> 01:22:30,279
You're just a guy
who's gotten by

1431
01:22:30,313 --> 01:22:31,580
on his smile
and his charm.

1432
01:22:31,614 --> 01:22:33,182
It's a good smile,

1433
01:22:33,216 --> 01:22:35,451
but you could
never lead a rape.

1434
01:22:35,484 --> 01:22:37,620
Well, that sure is
good to know.

1435
01:22:37,653 --> 01:22:41,590
Elisabeth Campbell
was murdered 36 hours ago.

1436
01:22:41,624 --> 01:22:45,594
Staked out with tent pegs
and strangled.

1437
01:22:45,628 --> 01:22:47,530
So I'm going to ask you
my question again,

1438
01:22:47,563 --> 01:22:49,532
captain bransford.

1439
01:22:49,565 --> 01:22:52,701
How scared are you
right now?

1440
01:22:52,735 --> 01:22:54,470
I was right here
on the post, lady.

1441
01:22:54,503 --> 01:22:57,073
But you were right there
7 years ago on maneuvers.

1442
01:22:57,106 --> 01:22:58,217
You were right there
for the rape.

1443
01:22:58,241 --> 01:22:59,475
You can't prove shit.

1444
01:22:59,508 --> 01:23:02,545
That's not what
Dr. slesinger's records say.

1445
01:23:02,578 --> 01:23:07,716
Yeah, ok. I went
to see slesinger.

1446
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:10,986
And I told him a story
that I had heard.

1447
01:23:12,188 --> 01:23:14,357
That's what his records say,
miss sunhill.

1448
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:15,624
It was just a story.

1449
01:23:15,658 --> 01:23:19,662
Somebody else's story,
and that's it, understand?

1450
01:23:33,676 --> 01:23:34,743
What is that?

1451
01:23:34,777 --> 01:23:37,380
What does it look like?

1452
01:23:37,413 --> 01:23:40,149
Well, it looks like
underwear.

1453
01:23:41,584 --> 01:23:43,519
Women's underwear.

1454
01:23:43,552 --> 01:23:46,255
Amazing scientific changes
in the last few years,

1455
01:23:46,289 --> 01:23:48,124
captain, wouldn't you agree?

1456
01:23:48,157 --> 01:23:49,592
I wouldn't know.

1457
01:23:49,625 --> 01:23:52,661
In certain fields,
it's been incredible.

1458
01:23:52,695 --> 01:23:55,298
Well, if you say so.

1459
01:23:55,331 --> 01:23:56,665
Like DNA...

1460
01:23:56,699 --> 01:23:59,402
If it's there,
it's there forever.

1461
01:24:01,337 --> 01:24:03,406
But then you probably
already knew that.

1462
01:24:05,441 --> 01:24:08,043
Those are hers,
aren't they?

1463
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:19,722
I tried to stop it.

1464
01:24:21,724 --> 01:24:24,393
I did everything I could,

1465
01:24:24,427 --> 01:24:26,329
but they hated her.

1466
01:24:26,362 --> 01:24:29,132
They hated her so much.

1467
01:24:29,165 --> 01:24:30,709
They hated that
she was smarter than them,

1468
01:24:30,733 --> 01:24:32,235
and they hated
being out there

1469
01:24:32,268 --> 01:24:34,370
with someone who had
to squat to piss.

1470
01:24:34,403 --> 01:24:35,738
I tried to save her.

1471
01:24:35,771 --> 01:24:38,774
I did everything I could,
but I couldn't make them stop.

1472
01:24:40,443 --> 01:24:43,346
Who were the others?

1473
01:24:43,379 --> 01:24:45,514
It was my recon squad.

1474
01:24:45,548 --> 01:24:47,716
Names are in the yearbook.

1475
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:51,287
Liz was my friend.

1476
01:24:55,358 --> 01:24:57,460
Thank you very much,
captain,

1477
01:24:57,493 --> 01:24:58,861
for your cooperation.

1478
01:24:58,894 --> 01:25:01,096
Someone from cid
will be in touch.

1479
01:25:05,768 --> 01:25:06,735
What are you doing?

1480
01:25:06,769 --> 01:25:08,737
What does it look like?

1481
01:25:08,771 --> 01:25:10,606
What about the DNA?

1482
01:25:10,639 --> 01:25:12,741
What DNA?

1483
01:25:12,775 --> 01:25:15,244
I bought those
an hour ago.

1484
01:25:15,278 --> 01:25:18,214
So long, honey.

1485
01:25:43,839 --> 01:25:46,209
That's a positive
match, right?

1486
01:25:46,242 --> 01:25:48,211
Cal: Yeah, Paul. It's
only a partial boot print,

1487
01:25:48,244 --> 01:25:49,778
but it's definitely
colonel Fowler's

1488
01:25:49,812 --> 01:25:51,380
and it's right
next to the body.

1489
01:25:51,414 --> 01:25:52,881
Good. Good work.

1490
01:25:52,915 --> 01:25:54,793
Now, look, we've only got
till the end of the day,

1491
01:25:54,817 --> 01:25:57,386
then the feds are gonna be
all over us. Gotta go.

1492
01:25:58,521 --> 01:25:59,655
Hi.

1493
01:25:59,688 --> 01:26:00,965
Look, I got a lot
on my plate just now.

1494
01:26:00,989 --> 01:26:03,192
I just want to thank you
for everything you did.

1495
01:26:03,226 --> 01:26:04,126
For what?

1496
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:07,162
For leaving the medical
records in the car.

1497
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:11,834
Now, did he instruct you to
give me the medical records?

1498
01:26:11,867 --> 01:26:13,802
Not in so many words,

1499
01:26:13,836 --> 01:26:15,738
but I think I knew
his wishes.

1500
01:26:15,771 --> 01:26:16,981
Anything that might
help Elisabeth.

1501
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:18,807
I'm sure you know
how much he loved her.

1502
01:26:18,841 --> 01:26:21,744
Not as much
as he loved you.

1503
01:26:21,777 --> 01:26:22,811
What do you mean?

1504
01:26:22,845 --> 01:26:24,813
I don't know.
Just something about

1505
01:26:24,847 --> 01:26:26,949
the surprise way
you came in that night,

1506
01:26:26,982 --> 01:26:29,818
the extra care he had
in making dinner.

1507
01:26:29,852 --> 01:26:31,687
What do you plan
on doing about it?

1508
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:34,357
Not a thing, other than to
tell you I'm sorry about Moore

1509
01:26:34,390 --> 01:26:36,859
and to ask you for your help.
Here, sit down.

1510
01:26:36,892 --> 01:26:38,761
What exactly
do you need to know?

1511
01:26:38,794 --> 01:26:40,763
I want to know
about the recreation

1512
01:26:40,796 --> 01:26:42,831
of the original rape.

1513
01:26:42,865 --> 01:26:45,301
I suppose that's
what it was.

1514
01:26:45,334 --> 01:26:47,470
Was it Moore's idea
to do this,

1515
01:26:47,503 --> 01:26:49,305
to cleanse her
of her past?

1516
01:26:49,338 --> 01:26:52,308
Oh, no. Jesus, no.
She thought it up.

1517
01:26:52,341 --> 01:26:54,377
He couldn't talk her
out of it.

1518
01:26:54,410 --> 01:26:58,481
So he felt so bad
that he killed himself?

1519
01:26:58,514 --> 01:27:00,949
Look, you and I both know
that's not how this happened.

1520
01:27:00,983 --> 01:27:05,421
And that is where they
screwed up, whoever did this,

1521
01:27:05,454 --> 01:27:08,424
because they didn't know
about Bob and me.

1522
01:27:08,457 --> 01:27:11,427
Bob could no sooner
have killed himself

1523
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:13,796
than I could pull
a chicken out of my ear.

1524
01:27:13,829 --> 01:27:15,640
But these nefarious types,
they don't get that.

1525
01:27:15,664 --> 01:27:18,401
They don't understand that.
Affairs of the heart.

1526
01:27:18,434 --> 01:27:20,002
Way beyond them.

1527
01:27:20,035 --> 01:27:22,871
Ok, so he staged
this thing, ok?

1528
01:27:22,905 --> 01:27:25,474
He tied her up, got rid
of her clothes, what?

1529
01:27:25,508 --> 01:27:28,577
Yeah. He also had to make
the call to the general

1530
01:27:28,611 --> 01:27:29,878
and play him the tape.

1531
01:27:29,912 --> 01:27:32,247
The tape?

1532
01:27:48,931 --> 01:27:52,267
Joe, brenner.

1533
01:28:02,745 --> 01:28:03,846
Paul...

1534
01:28:03,879 --> 01:28:05,548
Come in, please.

1535
01:28:10,386 --> 01:28:11,920
Just wanted
to say good-bye, sir.

1536
01:28:11,954 --> 01:28:14,457
I'll be driving back to
headquarters in the morning.

1537
01:28:14,490 --> 01:28:16,925
I'm leaving
tomorrow, too.

1538
01:28:16,959 --> 01:28:19,795
I'm taking Elisabeth
up to Michigan

1539
01:28:19,828 --> 01:28:22,064
to be buried
next to her mother.

1540
01:28:23,532 --> 01:28:27,970
Thank you...
For everything you did.

1541
01:28:28,003 --> 01:28:29,948
I understand you're still
going into politics, sir.

1542
01:28:29,972 --> 01:28:33,642
Oh... the jury's
still out.

1543
01:28:33,676 --> 01:28:35,310
We'll see.

1544
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:40,082
When you just thanked me
for what I had done,

1545
01:28:40,115 --> 01:28:42,385
what I wanted
to say to you

1546
01:28:42,418 --> 01:28:45,954
was I really
didn't do anything.

1547
01:28:45,988 --> 01:28:47,556
At least not
anything right.

1548
01:28:47,590 --> 01:28:49,958
I did a lot of things
that were wrong.

1549
01:28:49,992 --> 01:28:52,828
You're not responsible
for Moore's death, Paul.

1550
01:28:52,861 --> 01:28:55,097
Any good investigator has
to follow his instincts.

1551
01:28:55,130 --> 01:28:58,967
I'd like to talk to you
about that, sir.

1552
01:28:59,001 --> 01:29:01,970
We know Moore did it, then
killed himself out of guilt.

1553
01:29:02,004 --> 01:29:03,539
Then we're all
in agreement.

1554
01:29:03,572 --> 01:29:06,975
Then I got thinking,
what if I was wrong?

1555
01:29:07,009 --> 01:29:08,977
What if it wasn't
the same car 3 times,

1556
01:29:09,011 --> 01:29:10,846
but 3 different cars?

1557
01:29:10,879 --> 01:29:12,615
That's certainly
an interesting theory,

1558
01:29:12,648 --> 01:29:15,117
but what difference does it
make since Moore is dead?

1559
01:29:15,150 --> 01:29:16,985
Probably none, sir,

1560
01:29:17,019 --> 01:29:19,455
but it got me thinking
about your daughter

1561
01:29:19,488 --> 01:29:21,356
and what she told me
she taught.

1562
01:29:23,025 --> 01:29:25,994
"Mostly we fuck with
people's minds," she said.

1563
01:29:26,028 --> 01:29:27,796
Fowler: Ok, then...

1564
01:29:27,830 --> 01:29:30,633
Thank you, brenner.

1565
01:29:30,666 --> 01:29:32,000
You can go now.

1566
01:29:34,202 --> 01:29:36,004
Tell me about the rape.

1567
01:29:36,038 --> 01:29:37,606
Fowler:
But she wasn't raped!

1568
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:40,175
It was just made
to appear that way.

1569
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:43,512
The rape at west point.

1570
01:29:45,047 --> 01:29:47,049
It was kept
confidential,

1571
01:29:47,082 --> 01:29:48,617
for the good
of the academy.

1572
01:29:48,651 --> 01:29:50,018
And the army.

1573
01:29:50,052 --> 01:29:53,622
And it was best for
Elisabeth that way.

1574
01:29:53,656 --> 01:29:56,024
You were in Germany
when it happened.

1575
01:29:56,058 --> 01:29:59,161
Berlin. I was
stationed there.

1576
01:29:59,194 --> 01:30:00,963
I came back as
soon as I heard.

1577
01:30:00,996 --> 01:30:02,465
Fowler:
We flew all night.

1578
01:30:02,498 --> 01:30:04,767
And you went straight there
from the airport.

1579
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:06,769
Fowler: Of course!

1580
01:30:06,802 --> 01:30:08,403
No meeting first?

1581
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:15,043
Seems Mr. brenner
is very well-informed.

1582
01:30:15,077 --> 01:30:17,546
It was in her
psych record, sir.

1583
01:30:18,814 --> 01:30:21,984
It didn't happen that way!

1584
01:30:22,017 --> 01:30:26,054
George... he's right.

1585
01:30:26,088 --> 01:30:28,491
The meeting
did come first.

1586
01:30:30,092 --> 01:30:31,193
It was 7 years ago.

1587
01:30:31,226 --> 01:30:34,096
The details
get confusing.

1588
01:30:34,129 --> 01:30:35,698
It was nothing.

1589
01:30:35,731 --> 01:30:38,601
Just a quick briefing in
a hotel near the point.

1590
01:30:38,634 --> 01:30:42,605
General sonnenberg,
he was very...

1591
01:30:42,638 --> 01:30:44,106
Sympathetic.

1592
01:30:45,808 --> 01:30:49,812
I want justice
for my daughter.

1593
01:30:49,845 --> 01:30:53,682
I would give anything
if this had never happened,

1594
01:30:53,716 --> 01:30:56,084
but it did, and I'm
trying to tell you

1595
01:30:56,118 --> 01:30:58,086
the reality
of the situation.

1596
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:01,890
We'll never find them,
so we'll never know who did it.

1597
01:31:01,924 --> 01:31:03,659
But we do know this...

1598
01:31:03,692 --> 01:31:08,263
A coed academy is a good call,
a necessary call.

1599
01:31:08,296 --> 01:31:12,100
Better one unreported
and unvindicated rape

1600
01:31:12,134 --> 01:31:15,270
than to shake the foundations
of west point...

1601
01:31:15,303 --> 01:31:17,706
To cast suspicion
on a thousand soldiers

1602
01:31:17,740 --> 01:31:22,044
who did not gang-rape
a woman that night.

1603
01:31:22,077 --> 01:31:26,114
All you have to do
is convince your daughter

1604
01:31:26,148 --> 01:31:29,585
that she, the academy,

1605
01:31:29,618 --> 01:31:33,989
the army, and the cause of
equality would be best served

1606
01:31:34,022 --> 01:31:37,993
if she just forgot
about the whole thing.

1607
01:31:38,026 --> 01:31:40,863
These are the times
we live in, Joe.

1608
01:31:42,164 --> 01:31:44,132
Campbell: He was right.

1609
01:31:44,166 --> 01:31:47,002
If it had gone public,
it would have

1610
01:31:47,035 --> 01:31:50,072
permanently damaged
women in the military.

1611
01:31:52,174 --> 01:31:54,076
It would have destroyed
west point.

1612
01:31:54,109 --> 01:31:56,144
It was an
untenable situation.

1613
01:31:56,178 --> 01:31:58,146
Is that what
you told Elisabeth?

1614
01:31:58,180 --> 01:32:01,717
Not in
so many words, no.

1615
01:32:03,185 --> 01:32:04,319
She was...

1616
01:32:04,352 --> 01:32:08,323
In no condition
to understand that then.

1617
01:32:08,356 --> 01:32:12,227
I simply tried to tell
her that I loved her.

1618
01:32:14,730 --> 01:32:17,600
I loved her very much.

1619
01:32:18,734 --> 01:32:20,335
Daddy loves you...

1620
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:21,870
Mmm.

1621
01:32:21,904 --> 01:32:25,107
And he's so proud
of you.

1622
01:32:25,140 --> 01:32:28,176
Shh. Rest now.

1623
01:32:28,210 --> 01:32:31,113
Try not to think
about it anymore.

1624
01:32:31,146 --> 01:32:32,981
Shh. No, shh.

1625
01:32:33,015 --> 01:32:35,283
Baby, listen to me.

1626
01:32:35,317 --> 01:32:38,821
I only want what's
best for you.

1627
01:32:38,854 --> 01:32:39,622
Trust me.

1628
01:32:39,655 --> 01:32:44,559
Do you? Hmm?
Like you always did?

1629
01:32:48,664 --> 01:32:53,201
Then don't ever think
about any of this again.

1630
01:32:53,235 --> 01:32:57,673
I know, I know,
it was an awful thing.

1631
01:32:57,706 --> 01:33:00,008
A terrible,
terrible thing.

1632
01:33:00,042 --> 01:33:03,746
But thinking about it
won't help it,

1633
01:33:03,779 --> 01:33:05,848
so...

1634
01:33:07,282 --> 01:33:09,952
Close your eyes.

1635
01:33:12,254 --> 01:33:15,758
It never happened.

1636
01:33:15,791 --> 01:33:17,760
None of this...

1637
01:33:17,793 --> 01:33:20,262
Ever happened.

1638
01:33:45,287 --> 01:33:48,256
Not my finest hour.

1639
01:33:48,290 --> 01:33:50,859
Fowler: You were just
doing what you said...

1640
01:33:50,893 --> 01:33:53,061
Trying to protect her.

1641
01:33:53,095 --> 01:33:56,264
I did what I had to.

1642
01:33:56,298 --> 01:34:00,736
What I thought best
for everyone concerned.

1643
01:34:00,769 --> 01:34:04,272
There's nothing else
that could've been done.

1644
01:34:04,306 --> 01:34:06,441
We never would have
found them anyway.

1645
01:34:10,312 --> 01:34:11,714
Here you are, sir.

1646
01:34:11,747 --> 01:34:12,815
What is that?

1647
01:34:12,848 --> 01:34:17,019
Names of the perpetrators
by associate agent sunhill,

1648
01:34:17,052 --> 01:34:18,754
found with
a minimum of trouble.

1649
01:34:18,787 --> 01:34:20,723
Apple pie, sir.

1650
01:34:22,224 --> 01:34:25,193
Campbell: That's
just brilliant.

1651
01:34:25,227 --> 01:34:27,329
Each man will be looking
at 20 years, sir.

1652
01:34:27,362 --> 01:34:29,231
Fowler: I think
you'd better go now.

1653
01:34:29,264 --> 01:34:31,399
Fine.

1654
01:34:31,433 --> 01:34:33,769
We'll just deal with the
phone call issue tomorrow.

1655
01:34:33,802 --> 01:34:37,105
If you prefer.
Perhaps before your flight.

1656
01:34:37,139 --> 01:34:39,307
What phone call issue?

1657
01:34:39,341 --> 01:34:41,844
I've excellent
reason to believe

1658
01:34:41,877 --> 01:34:44,312
that Moore phoned
you at 0300 hours

1659
01:34:44,346 --> 01:34:46,348
the night
of the murder.

1660
01:34:47,983 --> 01:34:50,318
Why in the world
would he have done that?

1661
01:34:50,352 --> 01:34:51,920
Well, if I'm right, sir,

1662
01:34:51,954 --> 01:34:53,922
I think the whole
recreation of the rape

1663
01:34:53,956 --> 01:34:56,024
was Elisabeth's idea.

1664
01:34:56,058 --> 01:34:57,492
God knows why she did it.

1665
01:34:57,525 --> 01:34:59,461
Perhaps because you were
going into politics,

1666
01:34:59,494 --> 01:35:01,429
she thought this was
her last chance.

1667
01:35:01,463 --> 01:35:03,198
But I think
she got Moore to put her

1668
01:35:03,231 --> 01:35:07,202
in exactly the same position
the rapists did 7 years ago.

1669
01:35:07,235 --> 01:35:08,512
This time
you weren't in Germany,

1670
01:35:08,536 --> 01:35:11,273
and if I'm right,
she would have wanted you

1671
01:35:11,306 --> 01:35:13,275
to see firsthand
what you covered up.

1672
01:35:13,308 --> 01:35:16,344
That never happened.

1673
01:35:16,378 --> 01:35:18,847
A gift from Moore's lawyer.

1674
01:35:18,881 --> 01:35:20,482
Tape:
Dad, this is Elisabeth.

1675
01:35:20,515 --> 01:35:23,351
I need to discuss something
extremely urgent with you.

1676
01:35:23,385 --> 01:35:25,087
You must meet me
at the mount site

1677
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:27,455
no later than 0330 hours.

1678
01:35:27,489 --> 01:35:30,725
I have an answer
to your ultimatum.

1679
01:35:32,394 --> 01:35:35,397
It's hard to argue
with a recorded voice.

1680
01:35:35,430 --> 01:35:37,365
I'm sure that was
part of her plan.

1681
01:35:37,399 --> 01:35:40,302
What does she mean
by an ultimatum, sir?

1682
01:35:40,335 --> 01:35:43,371
I gave her 2 options...

1683
01:35:43,405 --> 01:35:45,507
Resign her commission

1684
01:35:45,540 --> 01:35:49,111
or agree to some
sort of therapy.

1685
01:35:49,144 --> 01:35:51,479
If she rejected
both of those,

1686
01:35:51,513 --> 01:35:53,816
I would instruct
the staff judge advocate

1687
01:35:53,849 --> 01:35:55,550
to investigate
her misconduct

1688
01:35:55,583 --> 01:35:59,287
and draw up charges for
a general court-martial.

1689
01:35:59,321 --> 01:36:03,926
I'm sure that seems
callous to you.

1690
01:36:03,959 --> 01:36:06,194
So you drove out
to the mount site.

1691
01:36:06,228 --> 01:36:09,031
Of course.

1692
01:36:09,064 --> 01:36:10,765
I needed an answer.

1693
01:36:12,567 --> 01:36:15,103
Elisabeth: Here's the answer
to your damn ultimatum!

1694
01:36:15,137 --> 01:36:17,405
Jesus Christ!

1695
01:36:17,439 --> 01:36:20,175
Do you see what
they did to me?

1696
01:36:20,208 --> 01:36:21,543
Do you see?

1697
01:36:21,576 --> 01:36:24,279
Don't turn away,
you coward!

1698
01:36:24,312 --> 01:36:28,416
Come closer! Get a better look!
See what they put me through!

1699
01:36:28,450 --> 01:36:30,886
What the fuck do you
hope to accomplish?

1700
01:36:30,919 --> 01:36:33,989
There's a rope
around my neck.

1701
01:36:34,022 --> 01:36:35,423
You can strangle me
if you want to

1702
01:36:35,457 --> 01:36:38,994
or you can just cover it up
like you did before.

1703
01:36:39,027 --> 01:36:42,164
Have you gone completely
out of your mind?!

1704
01:36:43,932 --> 01:36:46,234
It happened.

1705
01:36:46,268 --> 01:36:47,802
It happened!

1706
01:36:49,204 --> 01:36:51,073
I want to hear
you say it happened!

1707
01:36:51,106 --> 01:36:56,378
I don't give a damn what
happened to you 7 years ago.

1708
01:36:56,411 --> 01:36:58,146
Whatever hurts you
makes me stronger.

1709
01:36:58,180 --> 01:37:01,149
That which does not destroy me
makes me stronger.

1710
01:37:01,183 --> 01:37:04,953
You can't hurt me
anymore.

1711
01:37:07,489 --> 01:37:08,556
We're even.

1712
01:37:08,590 --> 01:37:12,160
That's fine with me.

1713
01:37:12,194 --> 01:37:14,062
You never helped me!

1714
01:37:16,098 --> 01:37:17,966
Daddy, please don't go.

1715
01:37:19,367 --> 01:37:20,869
Come back...

1716
01:37:20,903 --> 01:37:23,071
Please.

1717
01:37:23,105 --> 01:37:25,173
Please don't...

1718
01:37:28,443 --> 01:37:30,212
Daddy...

1719
01:37:39,554 --> 01:37:43,291
Brenner: So you were
in the second car.

1720
01:37:43,325 --> 01:37:47,229
Which means
colonel Fowler...

1721
01:37:47,262 --> 01:37:48,997
Must have been
in the third.

1722
01:37:53,168 --> 01:37:56,538
You couldn't expect the man
to deal with his own child.

1723
01:37:56,571 --> 01:38:00,175
She was screaming such
vituperations at him.

1724
01:38:03,078 --> 01:38:04,879
Course not.

1725
01:38:06,048 --> 01:38:08,516
So he called me...

1726
01:38:08,550 --> 01:38:10,518
And he asked me
to deal with it.

1727
01:38:10,552 --> 01:38:13,888
And I went.

1728
01:38:15,157 --> 01:38:17,192
And I found her dead.

1729
01:38:19,594 --> 01:38:21,696
You found her dead?

1730
01:38:21,729 --> 01:38:23,398
Of course.

1731
01:38:23,431 --> 01:38:28,603
But you will never get me to
testify against the general.

1732
01:38:30,438 --> 01:38:31,573
What?

1733
01:38:31,606 --> 01:38:35,543
I've been by
Joe Campbell's side

1734
01:38:35,577 --> 01:38:38,013
too many times.

1735
01:38:38,046 --> 01:38:41,183
Looked death in
the face with him...

1736
01:38:41,216 --> 01:38:43,318
Too many times.

1737
01:38:43,351 --> 01:38:45,553
I will not back down now.

1738
01:38:45,587 --> 01:38:48,556
What in god's name
are you talking about?

1739
01:38:48,590 --> 01:38:52,594
It wasn't like she
didn't give him reason.

1740
01:38:52,627 --> 01:38:54,596
George,
for Christ's sake!

1741
01:38:54,629 --> 01:38:58,566
And then
when we realized

1742
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:04,306
she was...
Fucking everybody

1743
01:39:04,339 --> 01:39:07,109
from bill Kent
to Jake elby,

1744
01:39:07,142 --> 01:39:09,577
it was too late
for official action.

1745
01:39:09,611 --> 01:39:12,114
Colonel Fowler!

1746
01:39:12,147 --> 01:39:16,318
We would have had to ask
for all their resignations.

1747
01:39:16,351 --> 01:39:18,120
Strangulation,
you think?

1748
01:39:18,153 --> 01:39:20,255
Then resign ourselves.

1749
01:39:21,556 --> 01:39:24,526
You need
civilian authority.

1750
01:39:24,559 --> 01:39:25,960
What happened to you?

1751
01:39:28,630 --> 01:39:30,132
You had no
other choice, sir.

1752
01:39:30,165 --> 01:39:33,601
You think I killed
my own daughter?

1753
01:39:33,635 --> 01:39:35,603
It'll die with me, Joe.

1754
01:39:35,637 --> 01:39:39,674
You sorry son of a bitch.

1755
01:39:40,808 --> 01:39:43,211
Where's Moore?
He was released.

1756
01:39:43,245 --> 01:39:44,346
Oh, my god.

1757
01:39:47,782 --> 01:39:49,484
Seiver.

1758
01:39:49,517 --> 01:39:50,618
Cal, it's me.

1759
01:39:50,652 --> 01:39:52,087
You arrest Fowler?

1760
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:53,621
No. Let me speak
to sunhill.

1761
01:39:53,655 --> 01:39:55,423
She's not here.
Got in about an hour ago,

1762
01:39:55,457 --> 01:39:56,767
then went back out
to the crime scene.

1763
01:39:56,791 --> 01:39:58,160
She go out there alone?

1764
01:39:58,193 --> 01:40:00,628
No, sir. She took
the big dog with her.

1765
01:40:00,662 --> 01:40:03,231
Captain America
himself... Kent.

1766
01:40:04,232 --> 01:40:07,269
His idea. He wants you
to meet them out there.

1767
01:40:07,302 --> 01:40:08,270
Yeah, of course he does.

1768
01:40:08,303 --> 01:40:11,773
Shit!

1769
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:27,021
Sunhill!

1770
01:40:32,827 --> 01:40:34,662
Bill, we've been through
this whole place

1771
01:40:34,696 --> 01:40:36,564
a dozen times before.
We're not gonna get

1772
01:40:36,598 --> 01:40:38,633
anything else
out of this.

1773
01:40:44,839 --> 01:40:46,174
Paul?

1774
01:40:47,209 --> 01:40:49,111
Sure, sure.

1775
01:40:49,144 --> 01:40:50,412
Paul.

1776
01:40:53,315 --> 01:40:54,149
I think the three of us

1777
01:40:54,182 --> 01:40:56,684
need to go back to
your office and talk.

1778
01:40:56,718 --> 01:40:58,686
I've always been
an outdoorsy kind of guy.

1779
01:40:58,720 --> 01:41:00,555
Why don't we
talk here? Kent.

1780
01:41:00,588 --> 01:41:04,626
That is if we have anything
really important to talk about.

1781
01:41:04,659 --> 01:41:05,793
I thought you'd do your job.

1782
01:41:05,827 --> 01:41:09,164
Pin it on Moore,
then move the fuck on.

1783
01:41:09,197 --> 01:41:10,565
Oh, god.

1784
01:41:10,598 --> 01:41:11,766
But I forgot

1785
01:41:11,799 --> 01:41:14,702
you were the nastiest rat
in the shithouse.

1786
01:41:14,736 --> 01:41:16,171
Just goes to show you.

1787
01:41:16,204 --> 01:41:18,206
Why'd you do it?

1788
01:41:19,507 --> 01:41:20,842
Why?

1789
01:41:20,875 --> 01:41:22,710
Well, you tell me.
You're the expert.

1790
01:41:22,744 --> 01:41:25,180
I think this was a woman

1791
01:41:25,213 --> 01:41:27,315
giving it out
all over the post,

1792
01:41:27,349 --> 01:41:28,816
and the one man
who cared about her,

1793
01:41:28,850 --> 01:41:30,852
the one who's willing
to risk it all for her,

1794
01:41:30,885 --> 01:41:32,854
is the person
she doesn't want.

1795
01:41:32,887 --> 01:41:37,091
And that's because she
couldn't want anybody.

1796
01:41:43,265 --> 01:41:46,734
See, I just wanted
to be with her forever.

1797
01:41:46,768 --> 01:41:48,470
She owned my heart.

1798
01:41:49,704 --> 01:41:50,872
She tormented me.

1799
01:41:50,905 --> 01:41:54,809
She became my obsession.

1800
01:41:56,778 --> 01:41:58,746
So I followed her

1801
01:41:58,780 --> 01:42:01,749
and found her
out there on the range...

1802
01:42:01,783 --> 01:42:03,918
On display.

1803
01:42:03,951 --> 01:42:05,887
Elisabeth.

1804
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:08,923
Get out of here, bill.
Get the fuck out of here.

1805
01:42:08,956 --> 01:42:11,926
He'll come back,
i know he will.

1806
01:42:11,959 --> 01:42:14,396
You can't be around.
You'll ruin it all.

1807
01:42:15,530 --> 01:42:16,764
What are you doing out here?

1808
01:42:16,798 --> 01:42:18,500
What's all this about?

1809
01:42:18,533 --> 01:42:19,767
Did my father send you?

1810
01:42:19,801 --> 01:42:20,902
Is that why you're here?

1811
01:42:20,935 --> 01:42:21,603
No.

1812
01:42:21,636 --> 01:42:23,505
Did he send you
to shut me up?

1813
01:42:23,538 --> 01:42:25,540
No.

1814
01:42:25,573 --> 01:42:26,774
No.

1815
01:42:26,808 --> 01:42:29,544
Well, this time
i won't be quiet.

1816
01:42:29,577 --> 01:42:32,214
This time I'm gonna
tell everything.

1817
01:42:32,247 --> 01:42:34,416
About him,
shh. About you.

1818
01:42:34,449 --> 01:42:35,783
I'm gonna
tell your wife.

1819
01:42:35,817 --> 01:42:38,520
I'm gonna tell
your kids.

1820
01:42:38,553 --> 01:42:40,788
Shh.

1821
01:42:40,822 --> 01:42:41,789
Don't touch me.

1822
01:42:41,823 --> 01:42:44,826
Get your hands
off me.

1823
01:42:50,598 --> 01:42:52,400
You repulse me.
Shh, shh.

1824
01:42:52,434 --> 01:42:53,468
You're a disgrace.

1825
01:42:53,501 --> 01:42:54,802
You're not a soldier.

1826
01:42:54,836 --> 01:42:56,704
You're not even a man.

1827
01:42:56,738 --> 01:42:58,673
You're just a fuck.

1828
01:42:58,706 --> 01:43:01,175
I fucked you.

1829
01:43:07,849 --> 01:43:09,551
Oh, Christ!

1830
01:43:14,289 --> 01:43:15,557
God!

1831
01:43:28,870 --> 01:43:31,005
Brenner: Come on, bill,
let's get going.

1832
01:43:31,038 --> 01:43:33,408
Come on.

1833
01:43:38,746 --> 01:43:41,349
I'm all yours, Paulie.

1834
01:43:41,383 --> 01:43:42,016
Whoa!

1835
01:43:42,049 --> 01:43:43,951
Before you come
any closer,

1836
01:43:43,985 --> 01:43:47,589
don't you want to know
where you're standing?

1837
01:43:47,622 --> 01:43:48,856
Where am I standing?

1838
01:43:48,890 --> 01:43:50,692
In a minefield.

1839
01:43:50,725 --> 01:43:52,360
Aw, come on, bill.

1840
01:43:52,394 --> 01:43:54,729
I buried some
bouncing betties.

1841
01:43:54,762 --> 01:43:56,598
Antipersonnel.

1842
01:43:56,631 --> 01:43:57,965
You buy that?

1843
01:43:57,999 --> 01:43:59,601
You're reasonably
safe here, Paul.

1844
01:43:59,634 --> 01:44:01,303
But little miss
can't-be-wrong

1845
01:44:01,336 --> 01:44:02,370
over there...

1846
01:44:02,404 --> 01:44:04,872
She's deep
in the hurt locker.

1847
01:44:04,906 --> 01:44:07,809
You remember how
the Betty works?

1848
01:44:07,842 --> 01:44:10,545
First man trips
the primary,

1849
01:44:10,578 --> 01:44:11,746
mine shoots up,

1850
01:44:11,779 --> 01:44:13,815
the rest of the column
walks into the blast.

1851
01:44:13,848 --> 01:44:16,551
Heads are removed,
or limbs. Whatever.

1852
01:44:16,584 --> 01:44:18,886
Backtrack
the way you came.

1853
01:44:18,920 --> 01:44:20,888
You know, it's amazing
what a load of shrapnel

1854
01:44:20,922 --> 01:44:22,757
will do to flesh and bone.

1855
01:44:22,790 --> 01:44:24,726
Brenner:
Sarah, you're fine.

1856
01:44:24,759 --> 01:44:26,260
God.

1857
01:44:29,096 --> 01:44:30,765
Boom!

1858
01:44:30,798 --> 01:44:32,900
Scared you, didn't I?

1859
01:44:32,934 --> 01:44:34,636
You're an asshole,
Kent.

1860
01:44:35,803 --> 01:44:37,305
Come on, bill,
it's over.

1861
01:44:39,474 --> 01:44:41,376
Yeah, it's over.

1862
01:44:44,846 --> 01:44:47,281
But not the way you think.

1863
01:45:16,878 --> 01:45:18,480
Atten-hut!

1864
01:45:18,513 --> 01:45:20,081
Present!

1865
01:45:20,114 --> 01:45:21,683
Hut!

1866
01:45:21,716 --> 01:45:23,117
Shoulder!

1867
01:45:23,150 --> 01:45:23,951
Hut!

1868
01:45:23,985 --> 01:45:25,553
Left shoulder!

1869
01:45:25,587 --> 01:45:27,555
Hut!

1870
01:45:28,990 --> 01:45:32,660
The human eye can distinguish
16 shades of gray.

1871
01:45:32,694 --> 01:45:35,963
A computer image processor
analyzing a fingerprint

1872
01:45:35,997 --> 01:45:38,866
can distinguish
256 shades of gray,

1873
01:45:38,900 --> 01:45:40,968
which is impressive.

1874
01:45:41,002 --> 01:45:44,038
The human heart,
mind, and soul, however,

1875
01:45:44,071 --> 01:45:46,974
can distinguish an infinite
number of emotional,

1876
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:49,711
psychological,
and moral shadings.

1877
01:45:49,744 --> 01:45:52,647
In psy ops we deal
with the blackest of black

1878
01:45:52,680 --> 01:45:54,749
and the whitest of white.

1879
01:45:54,782 --> 01:45:56,150
Thank you.

1880
01:45:56,183 --> 01:45:57,385
Ahem.

1881
01:46:00,555 --> 01:46:01,889
At ease, soldier.

1882
01:46:09,864 --> 01:46:11,433
Is colonel Fowler coming?

1883
01:46:11,466 --> 01:46:14,736
No. He's taking
some much-needed r&r.

1884
01:46:14,769 --> 01:46:16,838
He's a good man, George.

1885
01:46:16,871 --> 01:46:20,007
A good man
and a good soldier.

1886
01:46:20,041 --> 01:46:22,844
Sometimes the lines
get a little blurred,

1887
01:46:22,877 --> 01:46:25,847
but when push
comes to shove,

1888
01:46:25,880 --> 01:46:27,882
he'll do
what needs to be done.

1889
01:46:27,915 --> 01:46:30,017
And what is that, sir?

1890
01:46:30,051 --> 01:46:33,888
Why, say Moore
called him, of course,

1891
01:46:33,921 --> 01:46:36,157
and that i
was never out there.

1892
01:46:36,190 --> 01:46:38,125
He'll do that for me...

1893
01:46:38,159 --> 01:46:40,895
Even if it means
his career...

1894
01:46:40,928 --> 01:46:43,898
Like a good soldier.

1895
01:46:43,931 --> 01:46:48,102
Nothing is gained
by my involvement.

1896
01:46:48,135 --> 01:46:51,138
A letter of commendation
will be inserted

1897
01:46:51,172 --> 01:46:54,175
into your file...

1898
01:46:54,208 --> 01:46:58,680
In recognition of your
exemplary work on this case.

1899
01:47:06,087 --> 01:47:07,889
Remember
when I asked you

1900
01:47:07,922 --> 01:47:09,524
if you were a cop
or a soldier?

1901
01:47:09,557 --> 01:47:10,925
Yes, sir.

1902
01:47:10,958 --> 01:47:14,996
Well, you're
a soldier, Paul...

1903
01:47:15,029 --> 01:47:17,431
And a damn fine one.

1904
01:47:27,709 --> 01:47:29,677
General Campbell.

1905
01:47:30,778 --> 01:47:32,079
You're wrong.

1906
01:47:32,113 --> 01:47:33,915
I'm a rotten soldier.

1907
01:47:33,948 --> 01:47:35,249
Oh? And why is that?

1908
01:47:35,282 --> 01:47:38,520
You really don't
get it, do you?

1909
01:47:38,553 --> 01:47:39,386
The only mind

1910
01:47:39,420 --> 01:47:43,024
Elisabeth wanted
to fuck with was yours.

1911
01:47:45,059 --> 01:47:47,595
And you still don't get it.

1912
01:47:48,996 --> 01:47:51,165
I've done nothing wrong.

1913
01:47:52,667 --> 01:47:55,469
You killed her.

1914
01:47:57,138 --> 01:47:59,040
What did you say?

1915
01:47:59,073 --> 01:48:02,710
7 years ago
in that hospital room

1916
01:48:02,744 --> 01:48:04,946
when you told her
to just forget about it,

1917
01:48:04,979 --> 01:48:06,748
you killed her.

1918
01:48:06,781 --> 01:48:09,684
Kent killed her.

1919
01:48:09,717 --> 01:48:13,721
No. Kent just put her
out of her misery.

1920
01:48:15,590 --> 01:48:18,025
I once asked Moore
what was worse than rape.

1921
01:48:18,059 --> 01:48:20,762
Now I know.

1922
01:48:20,795 --> 01:48:23,297
Betrayal.

1923
01:48:23,330 --> 01:48:25,633
I loved Elisabeth...

1924
01:48:25,667 --> 01:48:28,903
But there were larger
issues to consider.

1925
01:48:28,936 --> 01:48:31,806
You traded her trust
for your career.

1926
01:48:31,839 --> 01:48:34,609
You made a deal, didn't you?

1927
01:48:34,642 --> 01:48:36,878
You kept silent,
and they gave you another star.

1928
01:48:36,911 --> 01:48:38,580
You watch your mouth,
brenner.

1929
01:48:38,613 --> 01:48:40,214
I'm gonna say that
in my report,

1930
01:48:40,247 --> 01:48:41,749
that you knew
she was out there,

1931
01:48:41,783 --> 01:48:43,618
that you went out
and talked to her

1932
01:48:43,651 --> 01:48:45,887
and left her there
to die.

1933
01:48:47,188 --> 01:48:49,757
You don't have
the balls.

1934
01:48:49,791 --> 01:48:51,593
Oh, you're wrong, sir...

1935
01:48:51,626 --> 01:48:54,161
Because that's just about
all I have left.

1936
01:48:54,195 --> 01:48:55,763
You do that,

1937
01:48:55,797 --> 01:48:58,299
and you can kiss
your career good-bye.

1938
01:48:58,332 --> 01:49:00,868
I'm gonna have you
court-martialed, general,

1939
01:49:00,902 --> 01:49:04,338
under article 32 for conspiracy
to conceal a crime.

1940
01:49:08,209 --> 01:49:10,912
Soldier: Ah-hut!

1941
01:49:24,225 --> 01:49:27,261
Soldier: Atten-hut!

1942
01:49:38,072 --> 01:49:39,807
When this all started,

1943
01:49:39,841 --> 01:49:44,378
I told you that we would find
the son of a bitch, sir.

1944
01:49:44,411 --> 01:49:48,850
I never expected that the son
of a bitch would be you.

1945
01:49:52,253 --> 01:49:54,388
Soldier: Firing party!

1946
01:49:54,421 --> 01:49:55,657
Ready!

1947
01:49:58,159 --> 01:49:59,761
Aim!

1948
01:49:59,794 --> 01:50:01,062
Fire!

1949
01:50:01,095 --> 01:50:03,130
Aim!

1950
01:50:03,164 --> 01:50:04,598
Fire!

1951
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:07,134
Aim!

1952
01:50:07,168 --> 01:50:08,602
Fire!

1953
01:50:14,742 --> 01:50:16,310
Present!

1954
01:50:17,444 --> 01:50:18,980
Arms!
