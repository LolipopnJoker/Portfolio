1
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,971
Wait for it.

2
00:01:22,921 --> 00:01:25,128
- Can I turn on the radio?
- No.

3
00:01:29,143 --> 00:01:31,599
Jane, you can't keep doing this.

4
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:36,110
The last seventeen occurrences,
had been predictable

5
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,228
- to the second.
- Jane...

6
00:01:37,228 --> 00:01:39,510
You're an astrophysicist
not some storm chaser.

7
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,386
I'm telling you,
there's a connection,

8
00:01:41,386 --> 00:01:44,369
between these atmosphere
disturbances and my research.

9
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:45,276
Erik, I...

10
00:01:45,276 --> 00:01:47,384
I wouldn't have asked you
to fly out here,

11
00:01:47,384 --> 00:01:49,497
if I wasn't absolutely sure.

12
00:01:49,497 --> 00:01:51,167
Jane?

13
00:01:51,167 --> 00:01:53,373
I think you wanna see this.

14
00:01:57,068 --> 00:01:58,540
What is that?

15
00:01:59,944 --> 00:02:01,120
God!

16
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,928
I thought you said,
it was a subtle aurora.

17
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:09,839
Go!

18
00:02:12,584 --> 00:02:14,369
Help me get down!

19
00:02:16,163 --> 00:02:18,600
- Get closer.
- Yeah, right! Good one!

20
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,777
Go!

21
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:38,898
What are you doing?

22
00:02:38,898 --> 00:02:42,390
I'm not dying
for six college credits!

23
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:05,466
I think that was legally
your fault.

24
00:03:05,466 --> 00:03:07,199
Get the first aid kit.

25
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:10,142
Do me a favor
and don’t be dead! Please!

26
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Where did he come from?

27
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,202
Once...

28
00:03:35,202 --> 00:03:39,528
mankind accepted
a simple truth,

29
00:03:39,528 --> 00:03:43,319
that they were not alone
in this universe.

30
00:03:45,033 --> 00:03:49,774
Some worlds, man believed
to be home to their gods.

31
00:03:49,774 --> 00:03:53,372
Others, they knew to fear.

32
00:03:56,177 --> 00:03:58,595
From a Realm
of cold and darkness,

33
00:03:58,595 --> 00:04:00,822
came the Frost Giants.

34
00:04:14,543 --> 00:04:16,639
Threatening to plunge
the mortal world,

35
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,907
into a new ice age.

36
00:04:24,762 --> 00:04:29,405
But humanity, would not face
this threat alone.

37
00:05:06,703 --> 00:05:08,965
Our armies drove
the Frost Giants,

38
00:05:08,965 --> 00:05:11,000
back into the heart
of their own world.

39
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,414
The cost was great.

40
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:19,888
In the end,
their king fell.

41
00:05:24,436 --> 00:05:28,115
And the source of their power,
was taken from them.

42
00:05:28,966 --> 00:05:31,054
With the last great war ended,

43
00:05:31,054 --> 00:05:33,575
we withdrew
from the other worlds,

44
00:05:33,575 --> 00:05:38,380
and returned home,
to the realm eternal...

45
00:05:39,417 --> 00:05:42,261
Asgard.

46
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:16,969
And here, we remain
as the beacon of hope.

47
00:06:16,969 --> 00:06:20,145
Shining out across the stars.

48
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:25,138
And though we have fallen
into man's myths and legends,

49
00:06:25,138 --> 00:06:27,530
it was Asgard,

50
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:31,849
and its warriors,
that brought peace...

51
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,762
to the universe.

52
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,858
But the day will come,

53
00:06:40,743 --> 00:06:45,913
when one of you,
will have to defend that peace.

54
00:06:45,913 --> 00:06:48,497
Do the Frost Giants
still live?

55
00:06:48,497 --> 00:06:50,438
When I'm a king...

56
00:06:50,438 --> 00:06:54,808
I'll hunt the monsters down,
and slay them all!

57
00:06:54,808 --> 00:06:56,859
Just as you did, Father.

58
00:06:56,859 --> 00:07:03,301
A wise king,
never seeks out war, but...

59
00:07:07,931 --> 00:07:10,140
he must always
be ready for it.

60
00:07:22,336 --> 00:07:24,544
- I'm ready, Father.
- So am I.

61
00:07:25,925 --> 00:07:28,684
Only one of you
can ascend to the throne.

62
00:07:28,684 --> 00:07:33,370
But both of you,
were born to be kings.

63
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,472
Oh, please.

64
00:08:09,258 --> 00:08:11,025
Yes!

65
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:56,153
Thor Odinson,

66
00:08:56,153 --> 00:08:57,625
my heir,

67
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:03,376
my first-born.

68
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:08,461
So long entrusted with
the mighty hammer, Mjolnir.

69
00:09:08,461 --> 00:09:12,464
Forged in the heart of
a dying star.

70
00:09:12,464 --> 00:09:14,685
It's power has no equal!

71
00:09:15,185 --> 00:09:21,310
as a weapon to destroy,
or as a tool to build.

72
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,253
It is a fit companion
for a King.

73
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:27,670
I have defended Asgard,

74
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:31,951
and the lives of the innocent
across the Nine Realms,

75
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:34,970
in the time
of the Great Beginning.

76
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,914
And though the day has
come for a new King...

77
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,573
Do you swear to guard
the Nine Realms?

78
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:07,673
I swear.

79
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:11,370
And do you swear
to preserve the peace?

80
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,703
I swear.

81
00:10:12,703 --> 00:10:15,723
Do you swear,

82
00:10:15,723 --> 00:10:18,565
to cast aside
all selfish ambition,

83
00:10:18,565 --> 00:10:21,440
and to pledge yourself only
to the good of the realms?

84
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,793
I swear!

85
00:10:22,793 --> 00:10:29,477
Then on this day,
I, Odin Allfather,

86
00:10:29,477 --> 00:10:35,325
will proclaim you...

87
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:46,690
The Frost Giants...

88
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:32,508
The Jotuns must pay for what
they’ve done!

89
00:11:32,508 --> 00:11:36,120
They have paid
with their lives.

90
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,396
The Destroyer did it's work,

91
00:11:38,396 --> 00:11:40,869
the Casket is safe,
and all is well.

92
00:11:40,869 --> 00:11:42,858
All is well?

93
00:11:42,858 --> 00:11:45,545
They broke
into the Weapons Vault!

94
00:11:45,545 --> 00:11:48,134
If the Frost Giants had stolen
even one of these relics...

95
00:11:48,134 --> 00:11:51,801
- But they didn’t.
- Well, I want to know why?

96
00:11:53,335 --> 00:11:55,707
I have a truce with Laufey,
King of the Jotun.

97
00:11:55,707 --> 00:12:00,960
He just broke your truce!
They know you're vulnerable.

98
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,191
What action would you take?

99
00:12:02,191 --> 00:12:04,715
March into Jotunheim
as you once did,

100
00:12:04,715 --> 00:12:06,353
teach them a lesson,

101
00:12:06,353 --> 00:12:08,097
break their spirits
so they’ll never dare--

102
00:12:08,097 --> 00:12:09,565
try to cross our borders again!

103
00:12:09,565 --> 00:12:11,028
You’re thinking only
as a warrior!

104
00:12:11,028 --> 00:12:13,793
- This was an act of war!
- It was the act of but a few,

105
00:12:13,793 --> 00:12:16,292
- doomed to fail.
- Look how far they got!

106
00:12:16,292 --> 00:12:18,942
We will find the breach in our
defenses, and it will be sealed.

107
00:12:18,942 --> 00:12:23,151
- As King of Asgard...
- But you're not King!

108
00:12:26,075 --> 00:12:27,550
Not yet.

109
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:02,122
It’s unwise to be in my company
right now, brother.

110
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:06,045
This was to be
my day of triumph.

111
00:13:08,365 --> 00:13:11,873
It will come.
In time.

112
00:13:11,873 --> 00:13:14,094
What’s this?

113
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,556
If it’s any consolation,
I think you’re right.

114
00:13:19,146 --> 00:13:22,673
About the Frost Giants,
about Laufey, about everything.

115
00:13:22,673 --> 00:13:25,968
If they found a way to penetrate
the Asgard defenses once,

116
00:13:25,968 --> 00:13:28,883
who’s to say they won’t try again.
Next time with an army.

117
00:13:28,883 --> 00:13:31,135
- Exactly!
- There’s nothing you can do,

118
00:13:31,135 --> 00:13:33,767
without defying Father.

119
00:13:34,704 --> 00:13:36,650
No. No, no, no, no, no.
I know that look!

120
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,851
It’s the only way to ensure
the safety of our borders.

121
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:41,712
- Thor, It’s madness.
- Madness?

122
00:13:41,712 --> 00:13:43,582
What sort of madness?

123
00:13:43,582 --> 00:13:45,779
We’re going to Jotunheim.

124
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:48,365
What?

125
00:13:48,365 --> 00:13:50,145
This isn’t like a journey to Earth,

126
00:13:50,145 --> 00:13:52,215
where you summon
a little lightning and thunder,

127
00:13:52,215 --> 00:13:55,269
and the mortals worship
you as a god.

128
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:56,285
This is Jotunheim.

129
00:13:56,285 --> 00:13:59,002
My father fought his way
into Jotunheim,

130
00:13:59,002 --> 00:14:02,144
defeated their armies,
and took their Casket.

131
00:14:02,144 --> 00:14:03,679
We would just
be looking for answers.

132
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:05,585
It is forbidden!

133
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:10,637
My friends, have you forgotten
all that we’ve done together?

134
00:14:10,637 --> 00:14:12,326
Fandral, Hogun?

135
00:14:12,326 --> 00:14:16,227
Who led you into
the most glorious of battles?

136
00:14:16,227 --> 00:14:17,466
You did.

137
00:14:17,466 --> 00:14:19,912
And Volstagg,
to delicacies so succulent,

138
00:14:19,912 --> 00:14:22,840
you thought you’d died
and gone to Valhalla?

139
00:14:24,268 --> 00:14:25,904
- You did.
- Yes.

140
00:14:25,914 --> 00:14:28,563
And who proved wrong all who
scoffed at the idea that--

141
00:14:28,563 --> 00:14:30,853
a young maiden could be one
of the fiercest warriors,

142
00:14:30,853 --> 00:14:32,000
this Realm has ever known?

143
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,949
- I did.
- True. But I supported you, Sif.

144
00:14:35,949 --> 00:14:38,088
My friends,

145
00:14:38,088 --> 00:14:40,154
We’re going to Jotunheim.

146
00:15:30,326 --> 00:15:32,254
Leave this to me.

147
00:15:33,052 --> 00:15:33,621
Good Heimdall...

148
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:35,936
You're not dressed
warmly enough.

149
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:37,066
I'm sorry?

150
00:15:37,066 --> 00:15:39,662
Do you think that
you can deceive me?

151
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,858
- You must be mistaken...
- Enough!

152
00:15:46,123 --> 00:15:47,813
Heimdall, may we pass?

153
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:54,537
Never has an enemy
slipped my watch, until this day.

154
00:15:56,073 --> 00:15:57,698
I wish to know
how that happened.

155
00:15:57,698 --> 00:15:59,061
Then tell no one
where we’ve gone,

156
00:15:59,061 --> 00:16:01,862
until we’ve returned.
Understand?

157
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:10,288
What happened?
Your silver tongue turn to lead?

158
00:16:54,407 --> 00:16:55,944
Be warned.

159
00:16:55,944 --> 00:16:57,794
I will honor my sworn oath,

160
00:16:57,794 --> 00:17:00,985
to protect this Realm
as its Gatekeeper.

161
00:17:00,985 --> 00:17:03,795
If your return threatens
the safety of Asgard,

162
00:17:03,795 --> 00:17:06,648
Bifrost will remain
closed to you.

163
00:17:06,648 --> 00:17:10,097
And you’ll be left to die
in the cold wastes of Jotunheim.

164
00:17:10,097 --> 00:17:12,079
Couldn’t you just leave
the bridge open for us?

165
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,230
To leave the bridge open,

166
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,552
would unleash
the full power of the Bifrost,

167
00:17:15,552 --> 00:17:19,138
and destroy Jotunheim
with you upon it.

168
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:23,096
- I have no plans to die today.
- None do.

169
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,502
We shouldn’t be here.

170
00:18:11,328 --> 00:18:13,638
Let's move.

171
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,053
Where are they?

172
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,803
Hiding. As cowards always do.

173
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:31,604
You've come a long way
to die Asgardians.

174
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:34,221
I am Thor Odinson.

175
00:19:34,221 --> 00:19:36,390
We know who you are.

176
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:39,335
How did your people
get into Asgard?

177
00:19:48,198 --> 00:19:52,440
The house of Odin
is full of traitors.

178
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,798
Do not dishonor
my father’s name with your lies!

179
00:19:55,798 --> 00:19:59,253
Your father is a murderer
and a thief.

180
00:19:59,253 --> 00:20:02,647
And why have you come here?
To make peace?

181
00:20:02,647 --> 00:20:06,577
You long for battle.
You crave it!

182
00:20:06,577 --> 00:20:12,646
You're nothing but a boy,
trying to prove himself a man.

183
00:20:12,646 --> 00:20:17,069
This boy has grown tired
of your mockery.

184
00:20:22,636 --> 00:20:25,373
Thor, stop and think.

185
00:20:25,373 --> 00:20:27,078
Look around you.
We are outnumbered.

186
00:20:27,078 --> 00:20:28,725
Know your place, brother...

187
00:20:28,725 --> 00:20:32,992
You know not what your actions
would unleash.

188
00:20:35,177 --> 00:20:37,258
I do.

189
00:20:37,258 --> 00:20:42,316
Go now, while I still allow it.

190
00:20:52,354 --> 00:20:56,761
We will accept
your most gracious offer.

191
00:21:08,113 --> 00:21:10,028
Come on, brother.

192
00:21:14,247 --> 00:21:16,322
Run back home, little princess.

193
00:21:16,572 --> 00:21:18,072
Damn!

194
00:21:23,614 --> 00:21:24,792
Next!

195
00:21:44,085 --> 00:21:46,913
At least make it
a challenge for me!

196
00:22:06,883 --> 00:22:09,397
That’s more like it!

197
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,901
Don’t let them touch you!

198
00:23:27,904 --> 00:23:29,082
Thor!

199
00:23:31,187 --> 00:23:34,228
- We must go!
- Then go!

200
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,459
Run!

201
00:24:00,662 --> 00:24:01,840
Thor!

202
00:25:08,449 --> 00:25:11,916
Heimdall! Open the bridge!

203
00:26:15,547 --> 00:26:18,356
Father!
We’ll finish them together!

204
00:26:18,356 --> 00:26:19,831
Silence!

205
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:32,510
Allfather.
You look weary.

206
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:35,963
Laufey. End this now.

207
00:26:35,963 --> 00:26:38,872
Your boy sought this out.

208
00:26:38,872 --> 00:26:40,348
You’re right.

209
00:26:41,556 --> 00:26:43,815
These are
the actions of a boy.

210
00:26:43,815 --> 00:26:45,500
Treat them as such.

211
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,386
You and I can end this,
here and now.

212
00:26:48,386 --> 00:26:49,987
before there’s further bloodshed.

213
00:26:49,987 --> 00:26:55,030
We are beyond diplomacy now,
Allfather.

214
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,687
He’ll get what he came for...

215
00:26:57,687 --> 00:27:02,152
war and death.

216
00:27:02,152 --> 00:27:03,627
So be it.

217
00:27:27,749 --> 00:27:28,774
Why did you bring us back?

218
00:27:28,774 --> 00:27:30,344
Do you realize what you’ve done?
What you’ve started?

219
00:27:30,344 --> 00:27:31,636
I was protecting my home.

220
00:27:31,636 --> 00:27:33,331
You cannot protect
your friends.

221
00:27:33,331 --> 00:27:35,093
How can you hope
to protect a kingdom?

222
00:27:35,093 --> 00:27:37,213
Get him to the healing room!
Now!

223
00:27:37,213 --> 00:27:39,017
There won’t be a kingdom
to protect,

224
00:27:39,017 --> 00:27:41,017
if you’re afraid to act!

225
00:27:41,749 --> 00:27:44,033
The Jotuns must learn
to fear me,

226
00:27:44,033 --> 00:27:45,897
just as they once
feared you.

227
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:48,352
That’s pride and vanity talking,
Not leadership!

228
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:50,454
Have you forgotten
everything I’ve taught you?

229
00:27:50,454 --> 00:27:53,318
- What of a warrior’s patience?
- While you wait and be patient,

230
00:27:53,318 --> 00:27:55,506
the Nine Realms laugh at us.

231
00:27:55,506 --> 00:27:56,643
The old ways are done.

232
00:27:56,643 --> 00:27:59,540
You’d stand giving
speeches while Asgard falls!

233
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:03,258
You’re a vain, greedy,
cruel boy!

234
00:28:03,258 --> 00:28:07,060
And you are an old man
and a fool!

235
00:28:12,805 --> 00:28:17,898
Yes. I was a fool,

236
00:28:17,898 --> 00:28:19,663
to think you were ready.

237
00:28:19,663 --> 00:28:22,214
- Father.
- Nay!

238
00:28:24,586 --> 00:28:29,227
Thor Odinson...

239
00:28:29,227 --> 00:28:32,614
You have betrayed the express
command of your King.

240
00:28:32,614 --> 00:28:35,179
Through your arrogance and
stupidity,

241
00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:37,086
you've opened these
peaceful Realms,

242
00:28:37,086 --> 00:28:42,829
and innocent lives to the horror
and desolation of war!

243
00:28:47,972 --> 00:28:49,371
You are...

244
00:28:49,371 --> 00:28:55,152
unworthy of these Realms!
unworthy of your title!

245
00:28:55,152 --> 00:28:57,789
You're unworthy...

246
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:04,284
of the loved ones,
you have betrayed.

247
00:29:14,184 --> 00:29:16,950
I now take from you,
your power!

248
00:29:17,493 --> 00:29:20,578
In the name of my father!

249
00:29:20,578 --> 00:29:23,134
And his father before!

250
00:29:23,134 --> 00:29:26,756
I, Odin Allfather,
cast you out!

251
00:29:32,709 --> 00:29:34,928
Whosoever holds
of this hammer,

252
00:29:34,928 --> 00:29:38,616
if he be worthy, shall possess
the power of Thor.

253
00:30:01,373 --> 00:30:03,272
I think that was legally
your fault.

254
00:30:03,272 --> 00:30:04,916
Get the first aid kit.

255
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:07,130
Do me a favor
and don’t be dead.

256
00:30:11,902 --> 00:30:15,481
Wow. Does he need CPR?
Because I totally know CPR.

257
00:30:27,476 --> 00:30:29,391
Where did he come from?

258
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,387
- You all right?
- Hammer! Hammer!

259
00:30:36,387 --> 00:30:39,351
Yeah, we can tell you’re hammered.
That’s pretty obvious.

260
00:30:39,351 --> 00:30:41,730
Oh, my God!
Erik, look at this.

261
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:44,549
We’ve got to move quickly
before this all changes.

262
00:30:45,574 --> 00:30:47,540
Jane, we have to take him to
the hospital.

263
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,855
- Father!
- He’s fine, look at him.

264
00:30:49,855 --> 00:30:51,236
Heimdall!

265
00:30:51,236 --> 00:30:54,058
I know you can hear me!
Open the Bifrost!

266
00:30:54,058 --> 00:30:55,993
Hospital.
You go, I'll stay.

267
00:30:55,993 --> 00:31:00,251
You! What Realm is this?
Alfheim? Nornheim?

268
00:31:00,251 --> 00:31:01,641
New Mexico!

269
00:31:01,641 --> 00:31:05,930
You dare threaten me,
Thor, with so puny a weapon!

270
00:31:09,342 --> 00:31:11,575
What?
He was freaking me out.

271
00:31:11,575 --> 00:31:13,766
Next time you decide
to taser someone,

272
00:31:13,766 --> 00:31:16,441
make sure
he's already in the car, okay?

273
00:31:17,316 --> 00:31:19,918
Jane, come on.

274
00:31:37,526 --> 00:31:41,676
- Name?
- He said it was "Thor".

275
00:31:41,676 --> 00:31:45,272
T-H-O-R.

276
00:31:45,272 --> 00:31:47,845
- And your relationship to him?
- I’ve never met him before.

277
00:31:47,845 --> 00:31:51,280
- Until she hit him with the car.
- I grazed him.

278
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,374
- But she tasered him.
- Yes, I did.

279
00:31:55,738 --> 00:31:56,914
Hi.

280
00:31:57,998 --> 00:31:59,432
Just taking a little blood.

281
00:31:59,432 --> 00:32:01,538
How dare you attack
the son of Odin!

282
00:32:01,538 --> 00:32:03,389
- I need some help!
- You need help?

283
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:06,681
Call security!

284
00:32:06,681 --> 00:32:08,991
Security to ER!
We need assistance!

285
00:32:22,425 --> 00:32:24,589
You’re no match
for the mighty...

286
00:33:16,401 --> 00:33:17,581
Huh.

287
00:33:25,458 --> 00:33:28,003
You don’t think this was just
a magnetic storm, do you?

288
00:33:28,003 --> 00:33:31,071
Look. The lensing around
these edges,

289
00:33:31,071 --> 00:33:33,674
is characteristic
of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

290
00:33:33,674 --> 00:33:34,689
A what?

291
00:33:34,689 --> 00:33:36,078
I thought you were
a science major.

292
00:33:36,078 --> 00:33:39,077
- Political Science.
- She was the only applicant.

293
00:33:39,077 --> 00:33:41,631
An Einstein-Rosen Bridge
is a theoretical connection,

294
00:33:41,631 --> 00:33:43,014
between two different points
of space-time.

295
00:33:43,014 --> 00:33:44,276
It's a wormhole.

296
00:33:44,276 --> 00:33:46,643
Erik, look...
What do you see?

297
00:33:46,643 --> 00:33:49,510
- Stars.
- Yeah. But not our stars.

298
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,224
See, this is the star alignment,

299
00:33:51,224 --> 00:33:53,210
for our quadrant,
this time of year.

300
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:56,909
And unless Ursa Minor
decided to take the day off...

301
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:58,859
these are someone
else’s constellations.

302
00:33:58,859 --> 00:34:01,276
Hey, check this out.

303
00:34:07,763 --> 00:34:09,681
No, it can't be.

304
00:34:11,415 --> 00:34:14,321
I think I left something
at the hospital.

305
00:34:28,882 --> 00:34:31,537
It’s not possible.

306
00:34:56,339 --> 00:34:58,956
- Oh, what the hell happened?
- I don't wanna know.

307
00:35:01,379 --> 00:35:04,549
I just lost my most important
piece of evidence. Typical.

308
00:35:04,549 --> 00:35:06,930
- Now what?
- We find him.

309
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:08,480
Did you see what he did
in there?

310
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,350
I'm not sure finding him
is the best idea.

311
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:11,568
Well, our data can't tell us--

312
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:12,860
what it was like to be
inside that event,

313
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,719
and he can.
So, we're gonna find him.

314
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:16,695
Okay.

315
00:35:16,695 --> 00:35:19,298
So you're gonna look
all over New Mexico, right?

316
00:35:19,298 --> 00:35:20,476
Exactly.

317
00:35:24,901 --> 00:35:27,112
Oh, what?

318
00:35:27,112 --> 00:35:30,570
I’m so sorry. I swear
I’m not doing this on purpose!

319
00:35:39,877 --> 00:35:43,845
# If you got a problem,
you don't care what it is #

320
00:35:43,845 --> 00:35:47,084
# you'll need a hand,
I can assure you this. #

321
00:35:47,084 --> 00:35:48,906
# I can help. #

322
00:35:48,906 --> 00:35:52,544
# I got two strong arms,
I can help. #

323
00:35:54,642 --> 00:35:57,024
# It would sure do me good #

324
00:35:57,024 --> 00:35:59,215
# to do you good
Let me help #

325
00:35:59,215 --> 00:36:01,272
Come on, pick it in now!

326
00:36:09,705 --> 00:36:11,179
Did it work?

327
00:36:31,625 --> 00:36:34,361
Sir...
we’ve found it.

328
00:36:40,111 --> 00:36:45,154
You know, for a crazy,
homeless person, he's pretty cut.

329
00:36:47,603 --> 00:36:49,524
Hey, sorry I tased you!

330
00:36:52,102 --> 00:36:54,022
Excuse me, excuse me!

331
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:03,313
- Umm.
- What is this?

332
00:37:03,313 --> 00:37:07,509
Oh...
My ex.

333
00:37:07,509 --> 00:37:11,607
Good with patience
and bad with relationships.

334
00:37:11,607 --> 00:37:14,086
Uh... They're the only clothes
I had that would fit you.

335
00:37:14,086 --> 00:37:17,205
- They will suffice.
- You're welcome.

336
00:37:17,205 --> 00:37:19,805
This mortal form
has grown weak.

337
00:37:19,805 --> 00:37:21,725
I need sustenance!

338
00:37:40,526 --> 00:37:42,296
We should never
have let him go.

339
00:37:42,296 --> 00:37:43,935
There was no stopping him.

340
00:37:43,935 --> 00:37:46,166
At least he’s only banished,
not dead.

341
00:37:46,166 --> 00:37:47,750
Which is what we’d all be
if that guard,

342
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:50,059
hadn’t told Odin
where we’d gone.

343
00:37:56,585 --> 00:37:58,593
How did the guard even know?

344
00:37:58,593 --> 00:38:00,287
I told him.

345
00:38:01,327 --> 00:38:02,287
What?

346
00:38:02,287 --> 00:38:04,901
I told him to go to Odin
after we’d left.

347
00:38:04,901 --> 00:38:06,523
He should be flogged
for taking so long.

348
00:38:06,523 --> 00:38:07,937
We should have never
reached Jotunheim.

349
00:38:07,937 --> 00:38:11,257
- You told the guard?
- I saved our lives.

350
00:38:11,257 --> 00:38:13,294
And Thor’s.

351
00:38:13,294 --> 00:38:16,985
I had no idea Father would
banish him for what he did.

352
00:38:16,985 --> 00:38:18,730
Loki...

353
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:19,905
you must go to the Allfather,

354
00:38:19,905 --> 00:38:21,518
and convince him
to change his mind!

355
00:38:21,518 --> 00:38:24,191
And if I do, then what?

356
00:38:24,191 --> 00:38:26,213
I love Thor more dearly
than any of you,

357
00:38:26,213 --> 00:38:27,662
but you know what he is.

358
00:38:27,662 --> 00:38:30,308
He’s arrogant, he’s reckless,
he’s dangerous!

359
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,544
You saw how he was today.

360
00:38:32,544 --> 00:38:35,494
Is that what Asgard needs
from its King?

361
00:38:38,867 --> 00:38:41,238
He may speak of
the good of Asgard,

362
00:38:41,238 --> 00:38:44,646
but he’s always been
jealous of Thor.

363
00:38:44,646 --> 00:38:46,976
We should be grateful to him.
He saved our lives.

364
00:38:46,976 --> 00:38:52,523
Laufey said there were traitors
in the House of Odin.

365
00:38:52,523 --> 00:38:57,219
A master of magic could bring
three Jotuns into Asgard.

366
00:38:57,558 --> 00:38:59,072
Loki’s always been one for
mischief,

367
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:02,760
but you’re talking about
something else entirely.

368
00:39:22,333 --> 00:39:24,307
Stop!

369
00:39:27,209 --> 00:39:31,004
- Am I cursed?
- No.

370
00:39:34,746 --> 00:39:36,867
What am I?

371
00:39:36,867 --> 00:39:39,050
You’re my son.

372
00:39:48,585 --> 00:39:50,504
What more than that?

373
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:56,783
The Casket
wasn’t the only thing,

374
00:39:56,783 --> 00:39:59,749
you took from Jotunheim
that day, was it?

375
00:40:05,733 --> 00:40:09,048
No.

376
00:40:09,048 --> 00:40:12,058
In the aftermath of the battle,
I went into the Temple,

377
00:40:12,058 --> 00:40:13,977
and I found a baby.

378
00:40:17,718 --> 00:40:21,173
Small for a giant’s offspring,

379
00:40:21,173 --> 00:40:25,125
abandoned, suffering,
left to die.

380
00:40:25,125 --> 00:40:27,664
Laufey’s son.

381
00:40:28,455 --> 00:40:31,219
Laufey’s son...

382
00:40:33,858 --> 00:40:35,900
Yes.

383
00:40:38,683 --> 00:40:42,213
Why? You were knee-deep
in Jotun blood.

384
00:40:42,213 --> 00:40:43,428
Why would you take me?

385
00:40:43,428 --> 00:40:46,029
- You were an innocent child.
- No.

386
00:40:46,029 --> 00:40:49,697
You took me for a purpose,
what was it?

387
00:40:52,753 --> 00:40:56,519
Tell me!

388
00:40:56,519 --> 00:40:59,719
I thought we could unite
our kingdoms one day,

389
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:02,968
bring about an alliance,
bring about a permanent peace,

390
00:41:02,968 --> 00:41:06,688
- ... through you.
- What?

391
00:41:06,688 --> 00:41:09,643
But those plans
no longer matter.

392
00:41:10,605 --> 00:41:14,126
So I am no more
than another stolen relic,

393
00:41:14,126 --> 00:41:16,532
locked up here until you
might have use of me.

394
00:41:16,532 --> 00:41:17,784
Why do you twist my words?

395
00:41:17,784 --> 00:41:20,034
You could have told me
what I was from the beginning.

396
00:41:20,034 --> 00:41:23,250
- Why didn’t you?
- You are my son.

397
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:25,783
I wanted only to protect you
from the truth.

398
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:27,289
What?
Because I...I...I...

399
00:41:27,289 --> 00:41:30,827
I'm the monster that parents
tell their children about at night?

400
00:41:30,827 --> 00:41:33,035
- Don’t...
- You know, it all makes sense now!

401
00:41:33,035 --> 00:41:35,768
Why you favored Thor
all these years.

402
00:41:35,768 --> 00:41:39,144
Because no matter how much
you claim to love me,

403
00:41:39,144 --> 00:41:40,628
you could never have
a Frost Giant,

404
00:41:40,628 --> 00:41:43,698
sitting on
the Throne of Asgard!

405
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:07,229
Guards!
Guards, please help!

406
00:42:12,705 --> 00:42:14,713
How'd you get inside
that cloud?

407
00:42:14,713 --> 00:42:17,423
Also how could you eat
an entire box of Pop Tarts,

408
00:42:17,423 --> 00:42:19,451
and still be this hungry?

409
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,075
This drink, I like it.

410
00:42:26,075 --> 00:42:28,828
- I know, it's great, right?
- Another!

411
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:32,648
Sorry, Izzy.
Little accident.

412
00:42:35,066 --> 00:42:37,025
- What was that?
- It was delicious. I want another.

413
00:42:37,025 --> 00:42:38,396
Well, you could have just
said so!

414
00:42:38,396 --> 00:42:41,148
- I just did.
- No. I mean ask nicely.

415
00:42:41,148 --> 00:42:42,447
I meant no disrespect.

416
00:42:42,447 --> 00:42:46,531
All right.
Well, no more smashing. Deal?

417
00:42:48,077 --> 00:42:51,995
- You have my word.
- Good.

418
00:42:52,975 --> 00:42:54,547
The usual, please, Izzy.

419
00:42:54,547 --> 00:42:57,657
You missed all the excitement
out at the crater.

420
00:42:57,657 --> 00:43:00,695
They’re saying some kind of
satellite landed out in the desert.

421
00:43:00,695 --> 00:43:03,410
Yeah, we were having
a good time with it,

422
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:04,735
Untill the Feds showed up.

423
00:43:04,735 --> 00:43:07,471
Excuse me, did you say
there was a satellite crash?

424
00:43:07,471 --> 00:43:08,767
Yeah.

425
00:43:08,767 --> 00:43:11,720
Oh, my God! This is going
on Facebook. Smile!

426
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:15,473
What did it look like,
the satellite?

427
00:43:15,473 --> 00:43:18,223
Well, I don’t know nothing
about satellites.

428
00:43:18,223 --> 00:43:23,792
But it was heavy.
Heavy. Nobody could lift it.

429
00:43:23,792 --> 00:43:26,776
They said it was radioactive.
I had my hands all over it.

430
00:43:26,776 --> 00:43:32,781
- Which way?
- Oh. Fifty miles west of here.

431
00:43:32,781 --> 00:43:34,266
But I wouldn't waste my time.

432
00:43:34,266 --> 00:43:36,616
Looked like the whole Army
was coming in when we left!

433
00:43:43,546 --> 00:43:46,281
- Where are you going?
- Fifty miles west of here.

434
00:43:46,281 --> 00:43:48,759
- Why?
- To get what belongs to me.

435
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:51,718
- Oh, so you own a satellite now?
- It's not what they say it is.

436
00:43:51,718 --> 00:43:52,572
Well, what ever it is,

437
00:43:52,572 --> 00:43:54,003
the government seems to think
it's theirs.

438
00:43:54,003 --> 00:43:56,290
So, you just intend
to go in there and take it?

439
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:58,801
Yes.

440
00:43:58,801 --> 00:44:00,462
If you take me there now,

441
00:44:00,462 --> 00:44:01,980
I’ll tell you everything
you wish to know.

442
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:03,549
- Everything?
- Yes.

443
00:44:03,549 --> 00:44:06,259
All the answers you seek will be
yours, once I reclaim Mjolnir.

444
00:44:06,259 --> 00:44:08,575
Myeu-muh?
What’s Myeu-muh?

445
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:10,492
Can I have a word, Jane?

446
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:16,655
Please don’t do this.

447
00:44:16,655 --> 00:44:19,307
You saw what I saw last night.
This is no coincidence.

448
00:44:19,307 --> 00:44:20,708
We have to find out
what's in that crater.

449
00:44:20,708 --> 00:44:22,603
But I'm not talking about
the crater. I'm talking about him.

450
00:44:22,603 --> 00:44:25,426
- But he's promising us answers.
- He’s delusional!

451
00:44:25,426 --> 00:44:28,366
Listen to what he's saying.
He's talking about Mjolnir,

452
00:44:28,366 --> 00:44:30,907
and Thor and Bifrost!

453
00:44:30,907 --> 00:44:33,189
It's the stories
I grew up with as a child.

454
00:44:33,189 --> 00:44:36,480
I'm just gonna drive him.
That's it!

455
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,053
He's dangerous, Jane.

456
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:47,381
I'm sorry.
But I can't take you.

457
00:44:47,381 --> 00:44:50,335
Then this is where
we say goodbye.

458
00:44:55,573 --> 00:44:59,527
Uh...

459
00:44:59,527 --> 00:45:00,705
Thank you!

460
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:08,918
Jane Foster, Erik Selvig, Darcy.
Farewell.

461
00:45:12,087 --> 00:45:15,791
Alright.
Back to work.

462
00:45:34,784 --> 00:45:38,343
Hey!
That’s my stuff!

463
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:43,929
What the hell is going on here?

464
00:45:43,929 --> 00:45:45,776
Ms. Foster, I’m Agent Coulson,
with SHIELD.

465
00:45:45,776 --> 00:45:47,529
Is that suppose
to mean something to me?

466
00:45:47,529 --> 00:45:49,322
- You can’t do this!
- Jane.

467
00:45:49,322 --> 00:45:52,235
Jane. This is a lot more serious
than you realize. Let it go.

468
00:45:52,235 --> 00:45:54,772
Let it go?
This is my life!

469
00:45:54,772 --> 00:45:56,789
We’re here investigating
a security threat.

470
00:45:56,789 --> 00:45:58,228
We need to appropriate
your records,

471
00:45:58,228 --> 00:45:59,574
and all your atmospheric data.

472
00:45:59,574 --> 00:46:02,333
By "appropriate"
you mean "steal"?

473
00:46:02,333 --> 00:46:04,920
Here. This should more than
compensate you for your trouble.

474
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,571
I can’t just buy replacements
of RadioShack!

475
00:46:07,571 --> 00:46:09,523
I made most of
this equipment myself!

476
00:46:09,523 --> 00:46:10,724
Then I’m sure
you can do it again.

477
00:46:10,724 --> 00:46:12,276
And I’m sure I can sue you,

478
00:46:12,276 --> 00:46:14,133
for violating
my constitutional rights!

479
00:46:14,133 --> 00:46:16,488
I'm sorry, Ms. Foster.
But we’re the good guys.

480
00:46:16,488 --> 00:46:18,581
So are we!

481
00:46:18,581 --> 00:46:22,475
I'm on the verge of understanding
something extraordinary.

482
00:46:22,475 --> 00:46:23,967
And everything I know
about this phenomenon,

483
00:46:23,967 --> 00:46:26,098
is either in this lab,
or in this book,

484
00:46:26,098 --> 00:46:28,148
and you can't just
take this with...

485
00:46:28,148 --> 00:46:32,130
- Hey!
- Jane! Easy! Easy!

486
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:37,312
Thank you
for your cooperation.

487
00:46:54,639 --> 00:46:57,657
Years of research, gone.

488
00:46:58,359 --> 00:47:00,937
They even took my iPod.

489
00:47:00,937 --> 00:47:03,652
- What about the backups?
- They took our backups.

490
00:47:03,652 --> 00:47:05,485
They took the backups
of our backups.

491
00:47:05,485 --> 00:47:07,361
They were extremely thorough.

492
00:47:07,361 --> 00:47:09,679
Just downloaded like
thirty songs onto there.

493
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:12,631
Could you please,
stop with your iPod!

494
00:47:13,262 --> 00:47:15,749
Who are these people?

495
00:47:16,935 --> 00:47:19,180
I knew this scientist.

496
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:21,868
a pioneer in gamma radiation.

497
00:47:21,868 --> 00:47:25,445
SHIELD showed up,
and...

498
00:47:25,445 --> 00:47:28,039
he wasn't heard from again.

499
00:47:28,039 --> 00:47:30,331
They're not gonna do that
to us.

500
00:47:30,331 --> 00:47:32,741
- I'm gonna get everything back.
- Come on, please!

501
00:47:32,741 --> 00:47:34,232
Let me contact
one of my colleagues.

502
00:47:34,232 --> 00:47:36,367
He's had some dealings
with these people before.

503
00:47:36,367 --> 00:47:39,667
I’ll email him
and maybe he can help.

504
00:47:39,667 --> 00:47:42,629
They took your laptop, too.

505
00:47:50,247 --> 00:47:54,018
All-Father, we must
speak with you urgently!

506
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:08,745
My friends.

507
00:48:08,745 --> 00:48:10,585
Where's Odin?

508
00:48:10,585 --> 00:48:13,535
Father has fallen
into the Odinsleep.

509
00:48:14,932 --> 00:48:18,268
Mother fears
he may never awaken again.

510
00:48:18,268 --> 00:48:19,302
We would speak with her.

511
00:48:19,302 --> 00:48:22,916
She has refused to leave
my father's bedside.

512
00:48:25,085 --> 00:48:28,035
You can bring
your urgent matter to me.

513
00:48:34,301 --> 00:48:35,778
Your King.

514
00:48:46,766 --> 00:48:52,167
My King, we would ask
that you end Thor's banishment.

515
00:48:55,931 --> 00:49:00,251
My first command can not be
to undo the Allfather’s last.

516
00:49:02,158 --> 00:49:04,860
We’re on the brink of war
with Jotunheim.

517
00:49:05,738 --> 00:49:08,729
Our people need
a sense of continuity,

518
00:49:08,729 --> 00:49:11,681
in order to feel safe
in these difficult times.

519
00:49:12,779 --> 00:49:18,008
All of us must stand together,
for the good of Asgard.

520
00:49:19,463 --> 00:49:21,418
Yes, of course.

521
00:49:21,418 --> 00:49:23,899
Good, then you await
for my word.

522
00:49:23,899 --> 00:49:25,964
If I may,

523
00:49:25,964 --> 00:49:29,678
beg the indulgence
of your majesty,

524
00:49:29,678 --> 00:49:32,954
- to perhaps reconsider...
- We're done!

525
00:50:35,487 --> 00:50:37,408
I need a horse!

526
00:50:39,089 --> 00:50:42,275
We don't have horses.
Just dogs, cats, birds.

527
00:50:42,275 --> 00:50:44,778
Then give me one of those,
large enough to ride.

528
00:50:45,901 --> 00:50:48,172
Hey, you still need a lift?

529
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:54,982
I've never done
anything like this before.

530
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:59,642
Have you ever done
anything like this before?

531
00:50:59,642 --> 00:51:03,434
Many times.
But you're brave to do it.

532
00:51:03,434 --> 00:51:06,018
Well, they just stole
my entire life's work.

533
00:51:06,018 --> 00:51:08,393
I don't really
have much left to lose.

534
00:51:09,793 --> 00:51:11,760
- But you're clever.
- Thanks.

535
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,738
Far more clever than
anyone else on this Realm.

536
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:17,437
Realm? Realm?

537
00:51:17,437 --> 00:51:20,864
- You think me strange?
- Yeah, I do.

538
00:51:20,864 --> 00:51:23,396
Good strange, or bad strange?

539
00:51:23,396 --> 00:51:25,317
I'm not quite sure yet.

540
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:32,017
I'm sorry.

541
00:51:37,346 --> 00:51:39,558
But who are you?

542
00:51:40,808 --> 00:51:42,610
Really?

543
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:47,081
You'll see soon enough.

544
00:51:47,081 --> 00:51:48,999
You promised me answers.

545
00:51:52,265 --> 00:51:54,312
What you seek, it's a bridge.

546
00:51:54,312 --> 00:51:56,167
Like an Einstein-Rosen Bridge?

547
00:51:56,167 --> 00:51:58,189
More like a rainbow bridge.

548
00:52:00,674 --> 00:52:02,890
God, I hope you're not crazy.

549
00:52:12,932 --> 00:52:15,893
I never get used
to seeing him like this.

550
00:52:15,893 --> 00:52:21,020
But he’s put it off
for so long now. But I fear...

551
00:52:22,714 --> 00:52:25,917
- How long will it last?
- I don't know.

552
00:52:25,917 --> 00:52:30,127
This time, it's different.
We were unprepared.

553
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:33,878
So why did he lie?

554
00:52:33,878 --> 00:52:35,423
He kept the truth
from you,

555
00:52:35,423 --> 00:52:38,313
so that you would never
feel different.

556
00:52:38,313 --> 00:52:44,038
You are our son, Loki.
And we your family.

557
00:52:44,957 --> 00:52:49,334
We mustn't lose hope that
your father will return to us.

558
00:52:50,413 --> 00:52:53,400
And your brother.

559
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,342
What hope is there for Thor?

560
00:52:55,342 --> 00:52:59,667
There's always a purpose
to everything your father does.

561
00:53:31,592 --> 00:53:33,370
This tube is a satellite crash?

562
00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:34,659
If they would've hauled
the wreckage away,

563
00:53:34,659 --> 00:53:36,984
they wouldn't built
a city around it.

564
00:53:37,694 --> 00:53:40,179
- You’re going to need this.
- What?

565
00:53:40,179 --> 00:53:41,657
Wait, why?

566
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,558
Now stay here.
Once I have Mjolnir,

567
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:50,335
I will return the items
they've stolen from you.

568
00:53:50,335 --> 00:53:54,014
- Deal?
- No! Look what’s down there!

569
00:53:54,014 --> 00:53:55,600
You think you're just
gonna walk in,

570
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,779
- grab our stuff, and walk out?
- No.

571
00:53:57,779 --> 00:53:59,967
I'm gonna fly out.

572
00:54:05,974 --> 00:54:07,189
Sir, feed from the keyhole.

573
00:54:07,189 --> 00:54:08,983
Can barely penetrate
the cloud cover.

574
00:54:08,983 --> 00:54:11,113
Tech’s barely working as it is,
with all the interference,

575
00:54:11,113 --> 00:54:12,297
that thing’s giving off.

576
00:54:13,209 --> 00:54:15,487
And we’ve got a commercial
aircraft coming in right over us,

577
00:54:15,487 --> 00:54:18,637
Southwest Airlines
Flight 5434.

578
00:54:18,637 --> 00:54:20,653
Reroute it,
like all the others.

579
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:22,514
Hold a sec...

580
00:54:22,514 --> 00:54:25,417
we've got something
outside the fence, west side.

581
00:54:25,417 --> 00:54:26,331
DeLancey, Jackson,

582
00:54:26,331 --> 00:54:29,176
west side perimeter,
go check it out.

583
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,290
DeLancey, Jackson,
report.

584
00:54:51,499 --> 00:54:53,912
Agent down!
We’ve got a perimeter breach!

585
00:55:06,401 --> 00:55:10,280
You’ve reached Dr. Erik Selvig.
Please leave me a message.

586
00:55:11,453 --> 00:55:15,016
Hi, Erik. It's me.
Don't worry, I'm fine. But...

587
00:55:15,016 --> 00:55:17,129
just in case you don’t hear
from me in the next hour,

588
00:55:17,129 --> 00:55:20,205
just come by the crater site
and try to find me, okay?

589
00:55:20,205 --> 00:55:21,968
I did exactly
what you told me not to.

590
00:55:21,968 --> 00:55:25,222
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. Bye!

591
00:55:27,042 --> 00:55:30,628
- You two, follow me!
- All the squad, move!

592
00:55:42,575 --> 00:55:46,964
Open the gate!
He breached our tunnel!

593
00:55:46,964 --> 00:55:49,101
Negative, negative!
Place is locked on!

594
00:56:04,864 --> 00:56:07,080
I need eyes up high.
With a gun.

595
00:56:32,330 --> 00:56:33,910
Pulling North!

596
00:56:41,712 --> 00:56:42,558
So, what have we got?

597
00:56:42,558 --> 00:56:45,243
There's a mass of electromagnetic
surge coming of that thing.

598
00:56:45,243 --> 00:56:46,991
Systems are barely coping.

599
00:56:47,583 --> 00:56:49,682
Barton. Talk to me.

600
00:56:50,738 --> 00:56:53,636
Do you want me
to slow him down, sir?

601
00:56:53,636 --> 00:56:56,123
Or you're sending in
more guys for him to beat up?

602
00:56:56,123 --> 00:56:57,302
I'll let you know.

603
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:13,488
You’re big.

604
00:57:14,485 --> 00:57:15,964
Fought bigger.

605
00:58:00,247 --> 00:58:02,245
You better call it Coulson,

606
00:58:02,245 --> 00:58:04,492
cause I'm starting to root
for this guy.

607
00:58:24,622 --> 00:58:27,881
- Last chance, sir!
- No, wait! I wanna see this.

608
00:59:11,042 --> 00:59:17,571
Why?!

609
00:59:37,205 --> 00:59:40,263
Alright, show’s over.
Ground units, move in.

610
01:00:31,969 --> 01:00:33,905
He committed a crime!
He's in jail!

611
01:00:33,905 --> 01:00:36,309
- I can't just leave him there!
- Why?

612
01:00:36,309 --> 01:00:41,059
- You didn't see what I saw!
- Look! Look! It's Myeu-muh.

613
01:00:45,075 --> 01:00:47,369
- Where'd you find this?
- The children's section.

614
01:00:47,369 --> 01:00:49,860
I just wanted to show you
how silly his story was.

615
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:51,687
But you're the one
who's always pushing me,

616
01:00:51,687 --> 01:00:54,388
to chase down every possibility,
every alternative!

617
01:00:54,388 --> 01:00:56,484
I'm talking about science,
not magic!

618
01:00:56,484 --> 01:00:58,968
Well magic's just science
that we don't understand yet,

619
01:00:58,968 --> 01:01:01,260
- Arthur C. Clarke.
- Who wrote science fiction.

620
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:04,374
- A precursor to science fact!
- In some cases, yes.

621
01:01:04,374 --> 01:01:05,914
Well, if there is
an Einstein-Rosen Bridge,

622
01:01:05,914 --> 01:01:07,171
then there's something
on the other side.

623
01:01:07,171 --> 01:01:09,093
And advanced beings
could have crossed it!

624
01:01:09,093 --> 01:01:11,594
Oh, Jane...

625
01:01:11,344 --> 01:01:12,844
A primitive culture like the vikings ...

626
01:01:13,194 --> 01:01:14,484
might have worshiped them as deities.

627
01:01:14,844 --> 01:01:15,844
Yes, yes, exactly!

628
01:01:16,094 --> 01:01:17,094
Thank you!

629
01:01:23,587 --> 01:01:24,538
You made my men,

630
01:01:24,538 --> 01:01:27,072
some of the most highly trained
professionals in the world,

631
01:01:27,072 --> 01:01:30,017
look like a bunch of
minimum wage mall cops.

632
01:01:31,608 --> 01:01:33,813
That's hurtful.

633
01:01:33,813 --> 01:01:35,073
In my experience,

634
01:01:35,073 --> 01:01:37,717
it takes someone
who's received similar training,

635
01:01:37,717 --> 01:01:40,297
to do what you did to them.

636
01:01:40,297 --> 01:01:43,235
Why don't you tell me,
where you received your training?

637
01:01:43,235 --> 01:01:47,531
Pakistan? Chechnya?
Afghanistan?

638
01:01:48,267 --> 01:01:51,606
You know, you strike me more
as the soldier of fortune type.

639
01:01:52,253 --> 01:01:55,335
Where was it?
South Africa?

640
01:01:56,629 --> 01:02:01,099
Certain groups pay very well
for a good mercenary like you.

641
01:02:02,942 --> 01:02:04,417
Who are you?

642
01:02:09,148 --> 01:02:11,744
One way or another we'll find out
what we need to know.

643
01:02:11,744 --> 01:02:13,661
We're good at that.

644
01:02:19,256 --> 01:02:21,494
Don't go anywhere.

645
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:29,821
Loki?
what are you doing here?

646
01:02:29,821 --> 01:02:31,673
I had to see you.

647
01:02:33,028 --> 01:02:37,086
What's happened?
Tell me? Is it Jotunheim?

648
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:38,396
Let me explain to father.

649
01:02:38,396 --> 01:02:40,309
Father is dead.

650
01:02:46,094 --> 01:02:47,276
What?

651
01:02:49,434 --> 01:02:52,061
Your banishment.

652
01:02:52,061 --> 01:02:55,471
The threat of a new war.

653
01:02:55,471 --> 01:02:57,680
It was too much
for him to bear.

654
01:02:59,723 --> 01:03:01,935
You mustn't blame yourself.

655
01:03:02,699 --> 01:03:05,172
I know that you loved him.

656
01:03:05,172 --> 01:03:08,195
I tried to tell him so,
but he wouldn't listen.

657
01:03:10,417 --> 01:03:12,622
So cruel to put the hammer
within your reach,

658
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:15,569
knowing that
you could never lift it.

659
01:03:17,921 --> 01:03:20,869
The burden of the throne
has fallen to me now.

660
01:03:26,857 --> 01:03:29,284
Can I come home?

661
01:03:29,284 --> 01:03:32,677
The truce with Jotunheim
is conditional upon your exile.

662
01:03:32,677 --> 01:03:34,378
Yes, but...
couldn't we find a way to...

663
01:03:34,378 --> 01:03:39,517
Your mother,
has forbidden your return.

664
01:03:41,919 --> 01:03:44,869
This is goodbye, brother.

665
01:03:46,178 --> 01:03:48,328
I'm so sorry.

666
01:03:53,816 --> 01:03:56,430
No.

667
01:03:56,430 --> 01:03:59,140
I am sorry.

668
01:04:03,576 --> 01:04:05,784
Thank you for coming here.

669
01:04:10,070 --> 01:04:11,820
Farewell.

670
01:04:24,561 --> 01:04:26,512
Goodbye.

671
01:04:26,512 --> 01:04:30,222
Goodbye?
I just got back.

672
01:05:05,764 --> 01:05:09,293
Sir...
he’s got a visitor.

673
01:05:14,146 --> 01:05:17,999
- His name is Donald Blake?
- Doctor Donald Blake.

674
01:05:17,999 --> 01:05:20,272
You have dangerous
co-workers, Doctor Selvig.

675
01:05:20,272 --> 01:05:21,874
He was distraught
when he found out,

676
01:05:21,874 --> 01:05:24,692
that you'd taken
all of our research.

677
01:05:24,692 --> 01:05:27,490
That was years of his life, gone!

678
01:05:29,133 --> 01:05:31,922
You can understand how a man
can go off like that.

679
01:05:31,922 --> 01:05:33,876
A big faceless organization
like yours,

680
01:05:33,876 --> 01:05:36,965
coming in with their
jack-booted thugs and...

681
01:05:38,034 --> 01:05:39,806
That's how he put it.

682
01:05:39,806 --> 01:05:40,854
That still doesn't explain,

683
01:05:40,854 --> 01:05:43,273
how he managed
to tear through our security.

684
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:47,010
Steroids!
He's a bit if a fitness nut.

685
01:05:48,017 --> 01:05:49,192
Sir?

686
01:05:54,021 --> 01:05:55,366
It says here
that he was an M.D.

687
01:05:55,366 --> 01:05:57,630
Well, he is!
Or he was.

688
01:05:57,630 --> 01:06:00,802
He switched careers
and became a physicist.

689
01:06:00,802 --> 01:06:02,148
A brilliant physicist.

690
01:06:02,148 --> 01:06:05,096
He's a... he's a wonderful man.
He's a man in pain.

691
01:06:07,086 --> 01:06:10,034
Oh, Donny, Donny, Donny!

692
01:06:10,587 --> 01:06:11,918
There you are!

693
01:06:11,918 --> 01:06:14,618
It’s gonna be all right,
I’m taking you home, now.

694
01:06:28,961 --> 01:06:31,514
Doctor Selvig?

695
01:06:31,514 --> 01:06:34,395
Just keep him away
from the bars.

696
01:06:34,395 --> 01:06:36,204
I will.

697
01:06:37,587 --> 01:06:40,782
- Where are we going?
- To get a drink.

698
01:06:40,782 --> 01:06:41,960
Follow them.

699
01:06:48,513 --> 01:06:50,753
You know,
I had it all backwards.

700
01:06:52,755 --> 01:06:54,675
I had it all wrong.

701
01:06:57,624 --> 01:07:01,853
Was that a bad thing, finding out
that you don't have all the answers?

702
01:07:01,853 --> 01:07:04,799
You start asking
the right questions.

703
01:07:07,861 --> 01:07:11,684
For the first time in...
in my life,

704
01:07:11,684 --> 01:07:17,660
I have no idea
what I'm supposed to do.

705
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:20,504
Anyone who's ever going
to find his way in this world,

706
01:07:20,504 --> 01:07:21,620
has to start by admitting,

707
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:23,686
he doesn't know
where the hell he is.

708
01:07:25,698 --> 01:07:27,210
Thank you,
for what you've done.

709
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:31,417
No, don't thank me.
I only did it for Jane.

710
01:07:31,417 --> 01:07:34,198
Her father and I
taught at University together.

711
01:07:34,198 --> 01:07:36,840
He was a good man.

712
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:39,262
He never listened.

713
01:07:39,262 --> 01:07:40,737
Neither did I.

714
01:07:42,077 --> 01:07:44,168
My father was trying
to teach me something.

715
01:07:44,168 --> 01:07:47,205
But I was too stupid to see it.

716
01:07:47,205 --> 01:07:48,904
I don't know
if you're delusional,

717
01:07:48,904 --> 01:07:52,927
or if you're putting
some kind of con. I don't care.

718
01:07:52,927 --> 01:07:55,530
I just care about her.

719
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:58,541
I've seen the way
she looks at you.

720
01:08:01,233 --> 01:08:04,124
I swear to you,
I mean her no harm.

721
01:08:04,124 --> 01:08:08,242
Good. In that case,
I'll buy you another round.

722
01:08:08,242 --> 01:08:10,926
And you'll leave town tonight.

723
01:08:15,087 --> 01:08:16,793
Two boilermakers!

724
01:09:08,649 --> 01:09:10,818
Kill him.

725
01:09:11,625 --> 01:09:14,682
After all I've done for you?

726
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:21,129
So you're the one who showed us
the way into Asgard.

727
01:09:21,129 --> 01:09:23,338
That was just a bit of fun really.

728
01:09:24,388 --> 01:09:28,257
To ruin my brother's big day.

729
01:09:28,257 --> 01:09:33,364
And to protect the realm from
his idiotic rule for a while longer.

730
01:09:33,364 --> 01:09:36,372
I will hear you.

731
01:09:39,031 --> 01:09:44,306
I will conceal you
and a handful of your soldiers,

732
01:09:44,306 --> 01:09:49,670
lead you into Odin's chambers
and you can slay him where he lies.

733
01:09:49,670 --> 01:09:51,882
Why not kill him yourself?

734
01:09:53,306 --> 01:09:56,782
I suspect that the Asgardians
would not take kindly to a King,

735
01:09:56,782 --> 01:09:59,836
who had murdered
his predecessor.

736
01:09:59,836 --> 01:10:04,783
Once Odin is dead,
I will return the casket to you.

737
01:10:04,783 --> 01:10:10,651
And you can return Jotunheim
to all it's uh...

738
01:10:10,651 --> 01:10:12,431
glory.

739
01:10:13,306 --> 01:10:16,279
I...

740
01:10:16,279 --> 01:10:18,562
accept.

741
01:10:23,924 --> 01:10:25,574
What troubles you, Gatekeeper?

742
01:10:25,574 --> 01:10:28,058
I turned my gaze upon you
in Jotunheim,

743
01:10:28,058 --> 01:10:31,433
but could neither see you
or hear you.

744
01:10:31,433 --> 01:10:32,541
You were shrouded from me,

745
01:10:32,541 --> 01:10:35,230
like the Frost Giants
had entered this Realm.

746
01:10:35,230 --> 01:10:36,649
Perhaps your senses
have weakened,

747
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:38,554
after your many years
of service.

748
01:10:38,554 --> 01:10:40,726
Or perhaps someone
has found a way to hide,

749
01:10:40,726 --> 01:10:43,904
that which he does not
wish me to see.

750
01:10:44,558 --> 01:10:47,582
You have great power,
Heimdall.

751
01:10:49,288 --> 01:10:51,205
Did Odin ever fear you?

752
01:10:52,943 --> 01:10:54,983
- No.
- And why is that?

753
01:10:54,983 --> 01:10:58,292
Because he is my King.
And I'm sworn to obey him.

754
01:10:58,292 --> 01:11:00,277
He was your King.

755
01:11:00,277 --> 01:11:03,508
And you are sworn
to obey me now.

756
01:11:03,508 --> 01:11:05,351
Yes?

757
01:11:09,778 --> 01:11:11,913
Yes.

758
01:11:11,913 --> 01:11:14,887
Then you'll open the Bifrost
to no one.

759
01:11:14,887 --> 01:11:18,568
Until I have repaired the damage
that my brother has done.

760
01:11:32,284 --> 01:11:34,905
Oh, my God!
Is he okay?

761
01:11:34,905 --> 01:11:37,002
He’s fine.
Not injured at all.

762
01:11:37,870 --> 01:11:40,067
- I'm Sorry, my friend.
- What happened?

763
01:11:40,067 --> 01:11:43,315
We drank. We fought.
He made his ancestors proud.

764
01:11:43,315 --> 01:11:45,227
Put him on the bed.

765
01:11:55,711 --> 01:12:00,738
Oh, I still don’t think
you’re the God of Thunder.

766
01:12:00,738 --> 01:12:03,050
But you ought to be.

767
01:12:14,072 --> 01:12:15,884
Are these your chambers?

768
01:12:15,884 --> 01:12:19,285
Uh... it’s more of
a temporary living situation.

769
01:12:19,285 --> 01:12:24,663
Oh, I'm sorry.
I don’t usually have guests.

770
01:12:24,663 --> 01:12:28,374
Actually...
We never had guests.

771
01:12:29,779 --> 01:12:32,139
That's not the right place
for it.

772
01:12:33,136 --> 01:12:35,029
I'm so sorry.

773
01:12:37,969 --> 01:12:41,824
- Can we go outside?
- Yes, of course.

774
01:12:46,839 --> 01:12:48,868
I come up here sometimes
when I can't sleep,

775
01:12:48,868 --> 01:12:51,334
or when I'm trying to reconcile
particle data,

776
01:12:51,334 --> 01:12:54,283
or when
Darcy's driving me crazy.

777
01:12:54,283 --> 01:12:57,967
I come up here a lot actually,
now that I think about it.

778
01:13:01,771 --> 01:13:04,755
I'm really glad you're safe.

779
01:13:04,755 --> 01:13:06,964
You've been very kind to me.

780
01:13:07,858 --> 01:13:10,335
I have been far less grateful
than you deserve.

781
01:13:10,335 --> 01:13:11,895
Well, I hit you with my car
a couple times,

782
01:13:11,895 --> 01:13:14,655
so I think
that kind of even things out.

783
01:13:16,429 --> 01:13:18,343
Perhaps I had it coming.

784
01:13:24,334 --> 01:13:25,809
Oh, my God!

785
01:13:26,812 --> 01:13:30,217
- I don't believe it!
- It was all I could get back.

786
01:13:30,217 --> 01:13:31,788
I'm sorry,
it's not as much as I promised.

787
01:13:31,788 --> 01:13:34,414
No! No! This is great!
This is...

788
01:13:34,414 --> 01:13:36,964
I don't have to start
from the scratch now.

789
01:13:36,964 --> 01:13:38,439
Thank you.

790
01:13:43,142 --> 01:13:44,613
What's wrong?

791
01:13:45,963 --> 01:13:48,166
SHIELD, whatever they are.

792
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:51,207
They're going to do everything
in their power,

793
01:13:51,207 --> 01:13:54,254
to make sure this research
never sees the light of day.

794
01:13:54,254 --> 01:13:58,543
No, Jane. Listen to me,
you must not give up.

795
01:13:58,543 --> 01:13:59,961
You must finish
what you started.

796
01:13:59,961 --> 01:14:02,850
- Why?
- Because you're right.

797
01:14:02,850 --> 01:14:04,319
Here, look.

798
01:14:06,666 --> 01:14:10,661
You're ancestors called it magic,
and you call it science.

799
01:14:10,661 --> 01:14:11,635
Well, I come form a place,

800
01:14:11,635 --> 01:14:14,584
where they're one
and the same thing.

801
01:14:28,189 --> 01:14:29,664
What is that?

802
01:14:30,594 --> 01:14:33,773
My father,
explained it to me like this,

803
01:14:33,773 --> 01:14:38,529
that your world is one of
the Nine Realms of the cosmos.

804
01:14:38,529 --> 01:14:41,831
Linked to each other
by the branches of Yggdrasil.

805
01:14:41,831 --> 01:14:44,065
The worlds tree.

806
01:14:44,065 --> 01:14:47,253
Now you see it everyday
without realizing.

807
01:14:47,253 --> 01:14:50,870
The images glimpsed through,
what did you call it? This...

808
01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:52,850
this hooble telescope.

809
01:14:52,850 --> 01:14:55,886
- Hubble.
- Hubble telescope.

810
01:14:58,851 --> 01:15:00,913
Tell me more.

811
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:03,228
So, the Nine Realms.

812
01:15:03,228 --> 01:15:05,983
Now there is Midgard,
which is earth.

813
01:15:05,983 --> 01:15:13,251
There's Alfheim, Vanaheim,
Jotunheim and Asgard.

814
01:15:13,251 --> 01:15:15,461
And that's were I come from.

815
01:15:32,374 --> 01:15:34,290
Thank you, Jane.

816
01:15:37,290 --> 01:15:39,248
Our dearest friend banished,

817
01:15:39,248 --> 01:15:41,751
Loki on the throne,
Asgard on the brink of war,

818
01:15:41,751 --> 01:15:43,629
Yet you've managed
to consume,

819
01:15:43,629 --> 01:15:45,845
four wild boar, six pheasant,

820
01:15:45,845 --> 01:15:48,672
a side of beef
and two casks of ale!

821
01:15:48,672 --> 01:15:51,362
Shame on you!
Don't you care!

822
01:15:51,362 --> 01:15:53,424
Do not mistake
my appetite for apathy!

823
01:15:53,424 --> 01:15:57,782
Stop it! Both of you!
Stop.

824
01:15:57,782 --> 01:15:59,306
We all know
what we have to do.

825
01:15:59,306 --> 01:16:03,146
We must go.

826
01:16:03,146 --> 01:16:05,498
We must find Thor.

827
01:16:06,739 --> 01:16:09,831
- It's treason.
- To hell with treason. It's suicide.

828
01:16:09,831 --> 01:16:12,992
Thor would do the same for us.

829
01:16:12,992 --> 01:16:15,747
Now, shh!

830
01:16:15,747 --> 01:16:18,244
Heimdall might be watching.

831
01:16:23,192 --> 01:16:25,403
Heimdall demands
your presence.

832
01:16:30,168 --> 01:16:31,763
We’re doomed.

833
01:16:31,763 --> 01:16:35,876
You would defy the commands
of Loki, our King,

834
01:16:35,876 --> 01:16:38,348
Break every oath
you have taken as warriors,

835
01:16:38,348 --> 01:16:40,880
and commit treason
to bring Thor back?

836
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:43,369
- Yes.
- Good!

837
01:16:43,369 --> 01:16:44,373
So you'll help us?

838
01:16:44,373 --> 01:16:46,885
I am bound by honor
to our King.

839
01:16:46,885 --> 01:16:50,072
I cannot open the bridge
to you.

840
01:16:50,072 --> 01:16:53,467
- Complicated fellow, isn't he?
- Now what do we do?

841
01:16:54,748 --> 01:16:55,926
Look!

842
01:17:15,404 --> 01:17:16,088
What the hell was that?

843
01:17:16,088 --> 01:17:18,354
I don’t know, sir. We got massive
energy readings out of nowhere,

844
01:17:18,354 --> 01:17:20,912
and then they just disappeared.
Fifteen miles due northwest.

845
01:17:20,912 --> 01:17:22,828
Let’s go take a look.

846
01:17:47,133 --> 01:17:49,277
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

847
01:17:49,277 --> 01:17:50,457
You're very welcome.

848
01:17:57,777 --> 01:18:00,362
Base to team two, we've got
activity outside the town.

849
01:18:00,362 --> 01:18:01,542
Stay on your target.

850
01:18:11,156 --> 01:18:13,925
Ensure my brother
does not return!

851
01:18:17,266 --> 01:18:19,182
Destroy everything!

852
01:18:29,795 --> 01:18:30,975
Mom?

853
01:18:39,169 --> 01:18:41,361
Is there a Renaissance Faire
in town?

854
01:18:41,361 --> 01:18:44,394
- Call it in.
- Yeah.

855
01:18:46,189 --> 01:18:50,146
Base, we've got... Xena,
Jackie Chan, and Robin Hood

856
01:18:50,146 --> 01:18:53,144
It's a beautiful theory, Jane.

857
01:18:53,144 --> 01:18:54,316
You won't be able
to convince...

858
01:18:54,316 --> 01:18:56,478
the scientific community
of any of it.

859
01:18:56,478 --> 01:18:58,038
Not without hard evidence.

860
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:00,713
Found you!

861
01:19:06,422 --> 01:19:07,897
My friends!

862
01:19:09,373 --> 01:19:11,705
This is good!
This is good!

863
01:19:11,705 --> 01:19:14,530
- I don't believe it!
- Oh, excuse me.

864
01:19:14,530 --> 01:19:17,476
Lady Sif,
and the warriors three.

865
01:19:18,955 --> 01:19:20,546
My friends,

866
01:19:20,546 --> 01:19:23,296
I have never been happier
to see anyone.

867
01:19:23,296 --> 01:19:25,506
But you should not have come.

868
01:19:26,961 --> 01:19:29,735
We're here to take you home!

869
01:19:29,735 --> 01:19:31,946
You know I can't go home.

870
01:19:33,678 --> 01:19:36,403
My father is...

871
01:19:36,403 --> 01:19:40,656
dead because of me.
I must remain in exile.

872
01:19:40,656 --> 01:19:42,492
Thor...

873
01:19:42,492 --> 01:19:45,471
your father still lives.

874
01:19:59,271 --> 01:20:02,640
Tell me, Loki, how did you get
the Jotuns into Asgard?

875
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:05,892
You think the Bifrost is the only
way in and out of this realm?

876
01:20:05,892 --> 01:20:07,556
There are secret paths
between the worlds,

877
01:20:07,556 --> 01:20:10,309
to which even you
with all your gifts are blind.

878
01:20:10,309 --> 01:20:13,563
But I have need of them
no longer, now that I am king.

879
01:20:13,563 --> 01:20:15,550
And I say,
for your act of treason,

880
01:20:15,550 --> 01:20:18,468
you are relieved of your duties
as Gatekeeper.

881
01:20:18,468 --> 01:20:20,666
And no longer
citizen of Asgard.

882
01:20:20,666 --> 01:20:22,876
Then I need no longer
obey you.

883
01:20:43,983 --> 01:20:46,638
Get somebody
from Linguistics down here.

884
01:21:14,284 --> 01:21:16,492
Was somebody else coming?

885
01:21:20,166 --> 01:21:23,328
- Is that one of Stark’s?
- I don't know.

886
01:21:23,328 --> 01:21:25,600
That guy never tells me
anything.

887
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:30,316
Hello!

888
01:21:30,316 --> 01:21:33,033
You’re using unregistered
weapons technology.

889
01:21:33,033 --> 01:21:35,278
Identify yourself.

890
01:21:38,062 --> 01:21:39,537
Here we go.

891
01:21:42,366 --> 01:21:44,515
Incoming!

892
01:21:51,286 --> 01:21:52,835
Jane, you have to leave.

893
01:21:52,835 --> 01:21:54,998
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm staying here.

894
01:21:54,998 --> 01:21:57,180
Thor is gonna fight with us.

895
01:21:57,180 --> 01:21:59,019
My friends,

896
01:21:59,019 --> 01:22:00,547
I'm just a man.

897
01:22:00,547 --> 01:22:03,203
I'll only be in the way,
or worse get one of you killed.

898
01:22:03,203 --> 01:22:05,339
But I can help
get these people to safety.

899
01:22:05,339 --> 01:22:07,970
Well, if you're staying,
then so am I.

900
01:22:07,970 --> 01:22:10,514
- We'll need some time.
- You'll have it.

901
01:22:10,514 --> 01:22:12,429
Okay, move it people!

902
01:22:12,986 --> 01:22:15,478
Everybody, out!
Use the backdoor!

903
01:22:15,478 --> 01:22:17,650
Go, hurry!
You can eat later!

904
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:31,595
Keep it distracted.

905
01:22:46,519 --> 01:22:49,006
For Asgard!!

906
01:23:24,463 --> 01:23:25,935
Fall back!

907
01:23:41,799 --> 01:23:44,001
Go, now! Run!

908
01:24:12,013 --> 01:24:13,848
Sif, you've done all you can.

909
01:24:13,848 --> 01:24:18,648
No! I will die a warrior's death.
Stories will be told of this day.

910
01:24:18,648 --> 01:24:21,592
Live, and tell those stories
yourself.

911
01:24:24,049 --> 01:24:25,949
Now, go!

912
01:24:33,246 --> 01:24:36,338
You must return to Asgard.
You have to stop Loki.

913
01:24:36,338 --> 01:24:37,624
What about you?

914
01:24:37,624 --> 01:24:41,122
Don’t worry, my friends.
I have a plan.

915
01:24:41,122 --> 01:24:42,597
Come on.

916
01:24:46,411 --> 01:24:49,192
We need to fall back.
Come on!

917
01:24:49,192 --> 01:24:50,371
Come on.

918
01:24:57,707 --> 01:24:59,120
Wait!

919
01:25:06,835 --> 01:25:08,643
What's he doing?

920
01:25:34,333 --> 01:25:38,492
Brother, whatever
I have done to wrong you,

921
01:25:38,492 --> 01:25:42,004
whatever I have done
to lead you to do this,

922
01:25:42,004 --> 01:25:48,000
I am truly sorry.
But these people are innocent.

923
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,782
Taking their lives
will gain you nothing.

924
01:25:58,848 --> 01:26:01,289
So take mine...

925
01:26:01,289 --> 01:26:03,141
and end this.

926
01:26:16,833 --> 01:26:18,013
No!

927
01:26:33,546 --> 01:26:38,254
- It's over.
- No. It's not over.

928
01:26:38,254 --> 01:26:41,797
- I mean, you're safe.
- We're safe.

929
01:26:42,887 --> 01:26:45,447
It's over.

930
01:26:50,206 --> 01:26:51,964
No.

931
01:27:09,989 --> 01:27:11,167
No.

932
01:27:39,076 --> 01:27:41,738
Whosoever holds
of this hammer,

933
01:27:43,553 --> 01:27:45,666
if he be worthy,

934
01:27:47,721 --> 01:27:50,570
shall possess
the power of Thor.

935
01:28:05,644 --> 01:28:06,826
Jane!

936
01:28:09,298 --> 01:28:11,502
- No. No.
- Let's go! Now!

937
01:28:11,502 --> 01:28:13,544
No!

938
01:28:32,778 --> 01:28:36,324
Oh. My. God.

939
01:29:46,041 --> 01:29:48,299
So is this
how you normally look?

940
01:29:48,299 --> 01:29:50,194
More or less.

941
01:29:50,194 --> 01:29:52,240
It's a good look.

942
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:53,976
We must go to the Bifrost site.

943
01:29:53,976 --> 01:29:55,463
I would have a word
with my brother.

944
01:29:55,463 --> 01:29:56,932
Excuse me!

945
01:30:00,387 --> 01:30:02,892
Donald,

946
01:30:02,892 --> 01:30:04,326
I don't think you've been
completely honest with me.

947
01:30:04,326 --> 01:30:05,916
Know this, son of Coul.

948
01:30:05,916 --> 01:30:07,579
You and I,
we fight for the same cause,

949
01:30:07,579 --> 01:30:08,902
the protection of this world.

950
01:30:08,902 --> 01:30:11,349
From this day forward
you can count me as your ally,

951
01:30:11,349 --> 01:30:14,168
if, you return the items
you have taken from Jane.

952
01:30:14,168 --> 01:30:16,126
- Stolen!
- Borrowed.

953
01:30:16,997 --> 01:30:19,034
Of course you can have
your equipment back.

954
01:30:19,034 --> 01:30:21,881
You're gonna need it
to continue your research.

955
01:30:21,881 --> 01:30:24,651
Would you like to see
the bridge we spoke of?

956
01:30:24,651 --> 01:30:26,938
Uh... sure.

957
01:30:28,695 --> 01:30:31,084
Wait!
I need to debrief you!

958
01:30:37,310 --> 01:30:39,226
Welcome to Asgard.

959
01:31:04,489 --> 01:31:06,702
Heimdall! Open the Bifrost!

960
01:31:14,470 --> 01:31:15,945
Heimdall.

961
01:31:19,906 --> 01:31:21,603
Heimdall.

962
01:31:23,278 --> 01:31:25,366
He doesn't answer.

963
01:31:25,366 --> 01:31:26,945
Then we’re stranded.

964
01:31:26,945 --> 01:31:30,830
Heimdall! If you can hear me,
we need you now!

965
01:31:30,830 --> 01:31:33,919
Heimdall!
we need you now!

966
01:31:39,785 --> 01:31:41,698
Heimdall!

967
01:31:55,988 --> 01:31:59,670
I must go back to Asgard.
But I give you my word,

968
01:32:00,287 --> 01:32:03,123
I will return for you.

969
01:32:10,305 --> 01:32:12,302
Deal?

970
01:32:25,131 --> 01:32:26,832
Deal.

971
01:32:41,867 --> 01:32:43,078
Get him to the healing room!

972
01:32:45,328 --> 01:32:46,328
Leave my brother to me.

973
01:33:10,587 --> 01:33:12,542
It's said,

974
01:33:12,542 --> 01:33:18,428
you can still hear and see
what transpires around you.

975
01:33:18,428 --> 01:33:21,199
I hope it's true.

976
01:33:23,817 --> 01:33:25,356
So that you may know,

977
01:33:25,356 --> 01:33:30,735
your death came
at the hand...

978
01:33:30,735 --> 01:33:33,060
of Laufey.

979
01:33:41,128 --> 01:33:44,073
And your death came
by the son of Odin.

980
01:33:49,510 --> 01:33:52,941
Loki,
you saved him.

981
01:33:57,162 --> 01:33:59,244
I swear to you mother,

982
01:33:59,244 --> 01:34:02,172
that they will pay
for what they have done today.

983
01:34:02,172 --> 01:34:03,942
Loki!

984
01:34:03,942 --> 01:34:06,068
Thor!

985
01:34:06,068 --> 01:34:08,279
I knew you'd return to us.

986
01:34:13,394 --> 01:34:14,989
Why don't you tell her?

987
01:34:14,989 --> 01:34:17,560
How you sent the Destroyer
to kill our friends!

988
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:19,766
- To kill me!
- What?

989
01:34:19,766 --> 01:34:22,368
Well, I must have been enforcing
father's last command.

990
01:34:22,368 --> 01:34:25,826
You're a talented lier, brother.
Always have been.

991
01:34:25,826 --> 01:34:27,529
It's good to have you back.

992
01:34:27,529 --> 01:34:31,210
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to destroy Jotunheim.

993
01:35:13,552 --> 01:35:14,552
You can't stop it.

994
01:35:15,902 --> 01:35:17,387
The Bifrost will build
until it rips Jotunheim apart.

995
01:35:40,775 --> 01:35:43,022
Jane?

996
01:35:44,035 --> 01:35:45,279
Why have you done this?

997
01:35:45,579 --> 01:35:48,143
To prove to father,
that I am a worthy son!

998
01:35:50,043 --> 01:35:52,135
When he wakes,
I will have saved his life.

999
01:35:52,435 --> 01:35:54,702
I will have destroyed
that race of monsters.

1000
01:35:55,199 --> 01:35:56,669
And I will be true heir
to the throne!

1001
01:35:57,169 --> 01:35:59,037
You can't kill an entire race!

1002
01:35:59,787 --> 01:36:00,787
Why not?

1003
01:36:03,989 --> 01:36:07,667
And what is this newfound love
for the Frost Giants?

1004
01:36:08,115 --> 01:36:11,584
You? who could have killed
them all with your bear hands.

1005
01:36:11,584 --> 01:36:14,074
- I've changed.
- So have I.

1006
01:36:15,553 --> 01:36:17,026
Now, fight me.

1007
01:36:20,084 --> 01:36:23,104
I never wanted the throne!

1008
01:36:23,104 --> 01:36:25,931
I only ever wanted to be
your equal.

1009
01:36:25,931 --> 01:36:27,709
I will not fight you, brother!

1010
01:36:27,709 --> 01:36:30,235
I'm not your brother.

1011
01:36:30,235 --> 01:36:33,553
- I never was!
- Loki, this is madness!

1012
01:36:33,553 --> 01:36:36,155
Is it madness?

1013
01:36:36,155 --> 01:36:38,736
Is it?

1014
01:36:38,736 --> 01:36:39,911
Is it?

1015
01:36:41,019 --> 01:36:44,694
Come on, what happened to you
on earth that turned you so soft?

1016
01:36:45,583 --> 01:36:47,793
Don't tell me it was that woman?

1017
01:36:48,540 --> 01:36:51,600
Oh! It was!

1018
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:54,268
Well, maybe
when we're finished here,

1019
01:36:54,268 --> 01:36:56,620
I'll pay here a visit myself!

1020
01:37:37,945 --> 01:37:39,121
Thor!

1021
01:37:46,606 --> 01:37:48,370
Brother, please!

1022
01:37:59,485 --> 01:38:00,842
Enough!

1023
01:38:44,811 --> 01:38:46,283
Look at you.

1024
01:38:48,424 --> 01:38:51,366
The mighty Thor!

1025
01:38:52,850 --> 01:38:55,810
With all your strength!

1026
01:38:55,810 --> 01:38:58,752
And what good
does it do you now?

1027
01:38:59,701 --> 01:39:03,619
Do you hear me, brother?
There's nothing you can do!

1028
01:39:21,559 --> 01:39:23,473
What are you doing?

1029
01:39:24,374 --> 01:39:28,048
If you destroy the bridge,
you’ll never see her again!

1030
01:39:37,424 --> 01:39:39,338
Forgive me, Jane.

1031
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:19,640
I could have done it, father!

1032
01:40:20,665 --> 01:40:22,896
I could have done it!

1033
01:40:22,896 --> 01:40:24,983
For you!

1034
01:40:24,983 --> 01:40:26,454
For all of us!

1035
01:40:28,395 --> 01:40:30,262
No, Loki.

1036
01:40:38,501 --> 01:40:39,972
Loki, no!

1037
01:40:47,256 --> 01:40:49,290
No.

1038
01:41:04,618 --> 01:41:06,646
It's gone.

1039
01:42:18,704 --> 01:42:21,664
And then,
with a mighty bellow,

1040
01:42:21,664 --> 01:42:26,277
I flew into the giant metal beast
and laid it low...

1041
01:42:26,277 --> 01:42:29,388
Is that another way of saying
you fell on your huge...

1042
01:42:29,388 --> 01:42:34,017
As a matter of fact,
falling down was a tactic.

1043
01:42:50,006 --> 01:42:52,948
My Queen,
I'm so sorry for your loss.

1044
01:42:58,794 --> 01:42:59,977
How is he?

1045
01:43:02,335 --> 01:43:04,546
He mourns for his brother.

1046
01:43:05,748 --> 01:43:07,953
And...

1047
01:43:07,953 --> 01:43:10,444
he misses her.

1048
01:43:10,444 --> 01:43:12,416
The mortal.

1049
01:43:28,328 --> 01:43:30,561
You'll be a wise king.

1050
01:43:34,354 --> 01:43:37,299
There will never be
a wiser king than you.

1051
01:43:38,063 --> 01:43:40,101
Or a better father.

1052
01:43:50,909 --> 01:43:54,701
I have much to learn.

1053
01:43:55,945 --> 01:43:57,853
I know that now.

1054
01:44:02,260 --> 01:44:05,706
But some day, perhaps,

1055
01:44:05,706 --> 01:44:08,393
I shall make you proud.

1056
01:44:15,343 --> 01:44:17,546
You’ve already
made me proud.

1057
01:44:31,934 --> 01:44:33,845
So, earth is lost to us?

1058
01:44:35,148 --> 01:44:39,322
No.
There is always hope.

1059
01:44:43,342 --> 01:44:45,254
Can you see her?

1060
01:44:47,708 --> 01:44:49,710
Yes.

1061
01:44:52,831 --> 01:44:54,530
I have the particle detectors.

1062
01:44:54,530 --> 01:44:56,825
Darcy, do you have
the SHIELD's satellite codes?

1063
01:44:56,825 --> 01:44:59,062
Yeah.
Have you seen my taser?

1064
01:44:59,062 --> 01:45:00,230
How is she?

1065
01:45:00,230 --> 01:45:02,966
In the car.
Come on, Jane.

1066
01:45:02,966 --> 01:45:05,461
She searches for you.

1067
01:53:14,515 --> 01:53:16,772
Doctor Selvig?

1068
01:53:19,515 --> 01:53:22,407
So, you're the man
behind all this?

1069
01:53:23,990 --> 01:53:26,856
It's quite a labyrinth.

1070
01:53:26,856 --> 01:53:31,320
I was thinking, they're taking me
down here to kill me.

1071
01:53:37,626 --> 01:53:41,527
I've been hearing about
the New Mexico situation.

1072
01:53:41,527 --> 01:53:43,601
Your work has impressed
a lot of people

1073
01:53:43,601 --> 01:53:45,334
who are much smarter
than I am.

1074
01:53:45,334 --> 01:53:47,504
I have a lot to work with.

1075
01:53:48,074 --> 01:53:51,625
The Forster theory,
a gate to another dimension.

1076
01:53:51,625 --> 01:53:53,794
It's unprecedented.

1077
01:53:55,505 --> 01:53:56,952
Isn't it?

1078
01:53:59,911 --> 01:54:03,641
Legend tells us one thing,
history another.

1079
01:54:03,641 --> 01:54:08,181
But every now and then, we find
something that belongs to both.

1080
01:54:16,024 --> 01:54:17,096
What is it?

1081
01:54:17,246 --> 01:54:18,246
Power, doctor.

1082
01:54:18,796 --> 01:54:20,562
If we can figure out
how to tap it,

1083
01:54:20,562 --> 01:54:22,445
maybe unlimited power.

1084
01:54:28,135 --> 01:54:30,311
Well, I guess
that's worth a look.

1085
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,419
Well, I guess
that's worth a look.
