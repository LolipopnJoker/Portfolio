1
00:01:11,311 --> 00:01:12,540
Wha... Ho!

2
00:01:12,613 --> 00:01:15,141
Whoa!

3
00:01:15,786 --> 00:01:19,282
Oh! Man, oh, man!

4
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,923
I almost lost it back there.

5
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,592
I didn't know what was going on.

6
00:01:23,669 --> 00:01:25,036
Oh!

7
00:01:25,105 --> 00:01:27,770
Oh...

8
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,910
Mmm.

9
00:01:49,956 --> 00:01:53,190
- Oh, hey, babe? Doug?
- Huh?

10
00:01:53,263 --> 00:01:56,292
Can you take Billy to school?
My day kinda got away from me.

11
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:59,205
Yeah, yeah. Unless there's
an emergency at the office.

12
00:01:59,275 --> 00:02:00,642
Oh, was there an emergency?

13
00:02:00,711 --> 00:02:02,908
You know, dentists
do have emergencies.

14
00:02:02,982 --> 00:02:05,214
- Oh.
- Sometimes.

15
00:02:05,288 --> 00:02:09,228
- Ah.
- We are doctors.

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,973
Hey, no, no! Not until your LDL
is under a hundred.

17
00:02:17,645 --> 00:02:21,176
Well, Mr. Putnam,
any plans this summer?

18
00:02:21,253 --> 00:02:24,852
What's... What'd he say?

19
00:02:24,927 --> 00:02:27,489
He said we're taking
an African safari.

20
00:02:27,566 --> 00:02:30,766
Africa. I don't think I've been
out of Cincinnati in 12 years.

21
00:02:30,839 --> 00:02:34,107
You owe it to yourself
to get out and enjoy life.

22
00:02:34,179 --> 00:02:38,644
You can't just live to work!
You need excitement!

23
00:02:40,392 --> 00:02:41,985
Come on. Don't be a baby,

24
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:45,592
it's a d... Oh, the suction,
the extractor. Hold on.

25
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:47,902
That'll suck the spots
off a Dalmatian.

26
00:02:47,974 --> 00:02:49,465
Help me, help me,
all right.

27
00:02:49,543 --> 00:02:52,208
Know what they call this?
One powerful little sucker.

28
00:02:52,282 --> 00:02:54,913
That's the brand name.
It's unbelievable.

29
00:02:54,988 --> 00:02:58,154
See? I have plenty of excitement
in my life, Mrs. Putnam.

30
00:03:03,572 --> 00:03:04,870
<i>Bobby?</i>

31
00:03:04,941 --> 00:03:07,378
Karen, I asked
for no disturbances.

32
00:03:07,447 --> 00:03:09,280
<i>I need to talk to you, Bobby.</i>

33
00:03:09,351 --> 00:03:11,787
Technically,
I'm at the office right now.

34
00:03:11,855 --> 00:03:14,349
And technically, you're
in our guest bedroom.

35
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:17,833
Look, I know baby. I... I just
gotta finish this chapter.

36
00:03:17,902 --> 00:03:19,200
I know. But you know what?

37
00:03:19,271 --> 00:03:21,765
I have to go to a job
that actually makes us money.

38
00:03:21,843 --> 00:03:24,109
And I'm late, so walk me to the door.

39
00:03:24,181 --> 00:03:26,515
Come on, Bobby.
I gotta get to work. OK?

40
00:03:26,586 --> 00:03:28,418
Oh, Wait. I forgot my cell phone.

41
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,756
- Stay.
- Hey, Daddy! Listen!

42
00:03:30,828 --> 00:03:34,130
Whoa.

43
00:03:34,201 --> 00:03:35,830
Hey, no. Inside voice.

44
00:03:35,904 --> 00:03:38,033
- Inside voice.
- Would you shut up!

45
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:41,412
God, it's like living
with a car alarm that shits.

46
00:03:41,483 --> 00:03:44,853
Whoa. What are you doing
trying to leave the house wearing that?

47
00:03:44,923 --> 00:03:48,020
- You look like a Eskimo hooker.
- Dad, that's the point.

48
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:51,535
- You wanna look like a hooker?
- Dad, you are so lame.

49
00:03:51,603 --> 00:03:55,840
It's hard for kids to respect a man
that don't do none of the providing.

50
00:03:55,912 --> 00:04:00,250
In my day the lady stayed home.
Not the lazy man.

51
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,655
In your day the men
had pyramids to build.

52
00:04:02,726 --> 00:04:04,092
How old is that?

53
00:04:04,162 --> 00:04:06,326
I'm in complete
control of my finan...

54
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,962
No.

55
00:04:09,038 --> 00:04:11,839
Hush. Come.

56
00:04:11,911 --> 00:04:14,644
How come she gets quiet
when you say something to her?

57
00:04:14,716 --> 00:04:17,187
Because you, my darling,
have no control.

58
00:04:17,255 --> 00:04:21,355
Baby, I know your how-to book
is gonna be a huge success someday.

59
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,593
But do you remember
what day today is?

60
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:25,035
No.

61
00:04:25,104 --> 00:04:27,336
We had agreed that
you would take a year off

62
00:04:27,409 --> 00:04:30,541
to pursue this little fantasy
of yours, but that year is up.

63
00:04:30,616 --> 00:04:32,175
Now you and I had a deal.

64
00:04:32,252 --> 00:04:34,883
Come on, baby.
Stressful cases.

65
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,985
Clients under duress.

66
00:04:37,062 --> 00:04:40,058
I'm tired of dealing
with shit all the time.

67
00:04:40,135 --> 00:04:43,039
Besides, how do we even know
they'll take me back?

68
00:04:43,108 --> 00:04:45,135
- Because I called.
- You're serious?

69
00:04:45,212 --> 00:04:48,412
The Firm is ecstatic
to have you back, Bobby.

70
00:04:48,485 --> 00:04:50,421
You got a nine o'clock
appointment.

71
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,590
- You call The Firm?
- Yeah, men's room.

72
00:04:55,667 --> 00:04:59,128
Some truck's driver must've crap
an entire cow in there, man.

73
00:04:59,207 --> 00:05:00,197
Good luck.

74
00:05:04,117 --> 00:05:05,950
I didn't want to
give him the key,

75
00:05:06,021 --> 00:05:07,957
but I didn't trust my instincts.

76
00:05:14,438 --> 00:05:18,469
I saw my father shot.
I never cry until today.

77
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:26,556
I got robbed yesterday,
and I know now,

78
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,725
your job is the bad one.

79
00:05:28,801 --> 00:05:31,364
Yeah.

80
00:05:48,975 --> 00:05:51,811
<i>- Dudley?
- Yes, good morning, Mac.</i>

81
00:05:51,881 --> 00:05:53,543
How's it going?

82
00:05:53,618 --> 00:05:55,747
<i>It is now
nine o'clock AM.</i>

83
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:59,056
Thanks, Mac.
Open Internet, please.

84
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:02,500
<i>- Command unknown.
- Open Internet.</i>

85
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:03,935
<i>Internet open.</i>

86
00:06:05,475 --> 00:06:07,968
I think I have to research
alternative specs.

87
00:06:08,047 --> 00:06:11,680
<i>- Searching alternative sex.
- What? No. I didn't say that.</i>

88
00:06:11,754 --> 00:06:13,519
<i>Granny Love dot org.</i>

89
00:06:13,591 --> 00:06:15,926
<i>- Want granny to take her teeth out?
- Shut down.</i>

90
00:06:15,997 --> 00:06:18,160
<i>Barnyard love.</i>

91
00:06:18,234 --> 00:06:20,671
<i>- I'm sorry.
- Enjoy the animals.</i>

92
00:06:21,607 --> 00:06:24,272
<i>Granny's gonna
spank your bottom.</i>

93
00:06:24,346 --> 00:06:26,009
<i>All kinds of fun.</i>

94
00:06:26,084 --> 00:06:28,715
<i>I can fix that.</i>

95
00:06:32,196 --> 00:06:34,189
Or not.

96
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:38,704
Well, iCat.

97
00:06:39,878 --> 00:06:41,940
Looks like it's you and me.

98
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,566
OK, Larry, so what are
you trying to tell me?

99
00:06:54,642 --> 00:06:57,135
- You're broke.
- Well, how does that work?

100
00:06:57,213 --> 00:06:59,946
You've spent everything
you had, then spent some more.

101
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:01,784
This is right here.
Nothing. Zero.

102
00:07:01,856 --> 00:07:03,188
You know what?

103
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,856
Maybe it's time for my wife,
the "supermodel,"

104
00:07:05,931 --> 00:07:08,459
to start paying for some things
for once in her life.

105
00:07:08,537 --> 00:07:09,835
You're getting divorced.

106
00:07:09,906 --> 00:07:13,209
- Why would she pay?
- Divorced, going broke...

107
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,216
You think I'm falling apart,
don't you?

108
00:07:15,284 --> 00:07:17,015
Not going broke.
You are broke.

109
00:07:17,087 --> 00:07:19,786
- OK.
- The door's behind you.

110
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,128
No, no, you listen to me, Toby.
You're not gonna push me around.

111
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,036
We agreed on a price, and
that's the price I'm gonna pay.

112
00:07:26,105 --> 00:07:29,134
You got it? And if you don't like it,
just walk away.

113
00:07:29,212 --> 00:07:31,945
I'll tell you this, you can
kiss your business goodbye.

114
00:07:32,017 --> 00:07:35,354
If you screw with Woody Stevens,
you go down hard. You got that?

115
00:07:35,425 --> 00:07:38,021
What?
No, money is not a problem.

116
00:07:38,097 --> 00:07:40,659
Don't insult me.
Don't insult me!

117
00:07:40,735 --> 00:07:42,136
Money's never a problem!

118
00:07:42,205 --> 00:07:44,972
You just have to honor
the correct price, you got that?

119
00:07:45,044 --> 00:07:46,946
What?

120
00:07:49,821 --> 00:07:52,793
Well, then go home, Toby!
You make me sick!

121
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,730
I can't do this many leaves
for ten bucks.

122
00:07:55,799 --> 00:07:57,062
It'll take hours!

123
00:07:57,135 --> 00:07:59,834
You should've thought of that
before you put that flyer

124
00:07:59,907 --> 00:08:02,674
on the telephone pole saying,
"Any yard for ten bucks."

125
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:06,012
Toby. Come on, let's talk.

126
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:08,580
Let's talk like men, OK?

127
00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:10,788
What's the problem?

128
00:08:10,863 --> 00:08:14,200
- Money's the problem!
- Grow up, Toby!

129
00:08:15,706 --> 00:08:18,007
- I hate you.
- I hate you!

130
00:08:19,547 --> 00:08:20,709
Moron!

131
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:26,990
- Kel, it's me.
- I'll be right down.

132
00:08:27,931 --> 00:08:29,263
Hey, Bill.

133
00:08:29,335 --> 00:08:34,003
You wanna shoot some hoops or
something before I take my ride?

134
00:08:34,077 --> 00:08:37,676
No, thanks.

135
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:41,191
- Uh...
- Hey, babe. How was work?

136
00:08:41,258 --> 00:08:42,989
- Mmm.
- Great.

137
00:08:43,062 --> 00:08:44,827
Good.

138
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,960
Hello? Cool. I'll ask right now.

139
00:08:47,037 --> 00:08:49,770
- Can I play ball with Stew and his dad?
- Of course you can.

140
00:08:49,843 --> 00:08:50,970
Cool. Thanks.

141
00:08:51,045 --> 00:08:53,608
Here, dude, I'll be right over,
OK? All right, bye.

142
00:08:53,684 --> 00:08:56,713
I just asked you if you wanted
to play ball. You said no.

143
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,851
Well, yeah. I mean,
Stew's dad is awesome.

144
00:08:58,927 --> 00:09:00,259
He can totally dunk.

145
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,801
The hoop's what?
Eight feet above the ground?

146
00:09:02,869 --> 00:09:06,934
- Anybody could dunk that.
- Well. See you guys later.

147
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,213
Doug, I am so sorry.
You know, I had no idea.

148
00:09:11,286 --> 00:09:13,313
It wasn't your fault.
You didn't know.

149
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:16,556
What do I gotta do
to relate to my son?

150
00:09:39,043 --> 00:09:41,070
Hey, guys?

151
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:43,174
Does this sound better?

152
00:09:44,186 --> 00:09:45,313
Whoa!

153
00:09:53,004 --> 00:09:56,306
I'm OK! I hit my butt.

154
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,489
Thanks, Woody.

155
00:10:35,557 --> 00:10:37,618
I feel really safe with you.

156
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:40,166
I noticed. If you ever
lay your head on my back again

157
00:10:40,233 --> 00:10:43,034
when you're riding bitch,
I'll throw you in the traffic.

158
00:10:43,106 --> 00:10:46,567
I... I was just trying
to keep the wind off my face.

159
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,813
- I felt you smell my neck.
- Guys, could we?

160
00:10:51,422 --> 00:10:53,449
Did you smell
that man's neck?

161
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,963
His cologne is fantastic.

162
00:10:56,032 --> 00:10:58,833
It's musky with an oaky finish.

163
00:10:58,904 --> 00:11:02,435
Like a lawyer cowboy.

164
00:11:02,512 --> 00:11:04,641
Lawyer cowboy?

165
00:11:05,618 --> 00:11:08,021
Wild Hogs aren't welcome here.

166
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,524
- Hey, Paul.
- How you doing?

167
00:11:09,593 --> 00:11:10,754
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Paul.

168
00:11:10,828 --> 00:11:12,024
Hey, Woody.

169
00:11:12,098 --> 00:11:14,797
Just waiting on those K-ones
to do your tax returns.

170
00:11:14,871 --> 00:11:18,207
We also need to talk about that
offshore incorporating thing.

171
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:19,940
Yeah, well,
I'll give you a call.

172
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:23,920
OK. I'll set up lunch.
Or we could do a day at the spa.

173
00:11:23,989 --> 00:11:25,891
Now that was fun.

174
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:28,931
- Huh?
- I don't remember that.

175
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:32,700
- Got your wine cooler, Dad.
- Oh, sweet. Thanks.

176
00:11:32,773 --> 00:11:35,210
- I'll see you Hogs in Hell!
- We'll make it.

177
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,046
- That was scary, Paul. Good work.
- See you later.

178
00:11:38,118 --> 00:11:41,215
- I'm not coming here anymore.
- But this is a Wild Hog tradition.

179
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,762
We're not Wild Hogs,
we're like wild lambs.

180
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,993
It's just a patch
that Doug's wife made.

181
00:11:46,067 --> 00:11:48,537
We sewed it on our jackets
so she wouldn't feel bad.

182
00:11:48,606 --> 00:11:50,165
- Is that a fact?
- Yeah.

183
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:52,109
Well, what has
your wife ever made us?

184
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:53,204
Hard.

185
00:11:53,281 --> 00:11:55,377
- Hey.
- That's true, she is really.

186
00:11:55,453 --> 00:11:59,017
- All I'm saying is she's good-looking.
- Show some respect.

187
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:02,031
Come on. That's what your wife does.
She's a swimsuit model.

188
00:12:02,099 --> 00:12:04,366
And it... And a good one,
I mean. She is hot.

189
00:12:04,438 --> 00:12:08,242
OK, here's a question:
What are we doing here?

190
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:10,646
Having... Having beers
like we do every week.

191
00:12:10,717 --> 00:12:14,350
No, no, no. Bigger picture. Life, man.
What do we have to look forward to?

192
00:12:14,424 --> 00:12:16,587
Riding in formation
in the Labor Day Parade?

193
00:12:16,663 --> 00:12:19,031
- Is that it?
- I'm looking forward to the parade.

194
00:12:19,101 --> 00:12:21,264
I got Tootsie Rolls
I can throw to the kids.

195
00:12:21,338 --> 00:12:22,932
Tootsie Rolls

196
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:24,774
that he can throw to the kids.

197
00:12:24,846 --> 00:12:28,650
Man, you can't even put on your
turn signal without busting your ass.

198
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,317
Look, let's put some
real miles on those bikes.

199
00:12:31,393 --> 00:12:34,797
- Road trip?
- Yeah. A road trip.

200
00:12:34,866 --> 00:12:39,069
Just us. No rules.
No Tootsie Rolls.

201
00:12:39,142 --> 00:12:41,909
Just us, the wind,
the road to the Pacific.

202
00:12:41,981 --> 00:12:44,042
We camp out for a week,
whenever we want,

203
00:12:44,118 --> 00:12:45,951
wherever we want.

204
00:12:46,022 --> 00:12:47,513
I mean, that's freedom, man.

205
00:12:47,592 --> 00:12:49,654
As long as we stop
at some Wi-Fi hotspots,

206
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,962
- count me in. Yep.
- You're in? All right.

207
00:12:52,034 --> 00:12:55,200
Eh, I can't.
I can't get the time off of work.

208
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,041
- You know, I'm a doctor.
- You're a dentist.

209
00:12:58,113 --> 00:13:01,518
Look, in college... Man,
he'd have been packed already.

210
00:13:01,587 --> 00:13:04,559
I'm not kidding. You know,
and on a bike, he's fearless.

211
00:13:04,627 --> 00:13:06,756
- He was fearless.
- Yeah, well, that was...

212
00:13:06,831 --> 00:13:09,861
This guy, we called him
"The Golden Knight." Where's that guy?

213
00:13:09,938 --> 00:13:12,876
- I wanna see that guy again.
- That guy's married now.

214
00:13:12,944 --> 00:13:16,782
And that guy, uh, used to...
used to get high a lot.

215
00:13:16,852 --> 00:13:19,254
- What's Claudia gonna say about this?
- Nothing.

216
00:13:19,323 --> 00:13:23,388
<i>She's in the Bahamas doing some
swimsuit thing for Sports Illustrated.</i>

217
00:13:23,465 --> 00:13:25,332
Look, if not now, when?

218
00:13:25,403 --> 00:13:29,035
Y'all know me.
I'm the first to get buck wild.

219
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:31,580
- But...
- No, you're afraid to ask your wife.

220
00:13:31,648 --> 00:13:35,247
True. True. I said true!

221
00:13:35,323 --> 00:13:36,952
Come on!

222
00:13:37,026 --> 00:13:40,123
<i>This is it, on the edge, we're living!
You know, St. Elmo's Fire,</i>

223
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:42,169
<i>The Wild Bunch.
You know, Deliverance!</i>

224
00:13:42,236 --> 00:13:43,329
<i>Deliverance?</i>

225
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,102
<i>- Uh... You know...
- Deliverance?</i>

226
00:13:45,176 --> 00:13:47,009
<i>Deliverance?</i>

227
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,950
Hey, dudes. We're gonna
ride as an American flag

228
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:51,248
in the parade this year.

229
00:13:51,321 --> 00:13:53,622
Each guy in our chapter
is a star.

230
00:13:53,693 --> 00:13:55,356
- A what?
- I'm gonna get sick.

231
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:58,800
- Who's gonna do the stripes?
- Lyman Middle School majorettes.

232
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,205
Oh, boy. Hey, we're
really living now, huh?

233
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:03,268
I hope we don't get
hit by a stray baton.

234
00:14:03,346 --> 00:14:05,213
You know what?
I'm outta here.

235
00:14:05,283 --> 00:14:07,515
I'm going with you guys
or without you guys.

236
00:14:07,588 --> 00:14:08,715
You know what I mean?

237
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,657
Take your smelly tees.
Good night.

238
00:14:10,727 --> 00:14:12,492
- I said I'd go.
- Come on back.

239
00:14:12,564 --> 00:14:15,297
Hmm. Oh, I almost forgot.

240
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:17,739
We're also gonna be wearing
these black ribbons

241
00:14:17,809 --> 00:14:20,645
in honor of Tom Peterson.
He died last week...

242
00:14:20,715 --> 00:14:24,780
Boom! Just like that.
Anyway, he'll be missed.

243
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,396
Tom Peterson. Tom Peterson.

244
00:14:28,464 --> 00:14:30,457
Do you remember that guy?

245
00:14:30,535 --> 00:14:32,562
He was our age.

246
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,255
- Mom, want some gravy?
- Oh, yeah, thanks.

247
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:50,232
- So how was your ride?
- I don't know.

248
00:14:50,308 --> 00:14:53,873
All Woody did was yap about taking
some stupid cross-country trip.

249
00:14:53,949 --> 00:14:56,078
Do you wanna talk
about going on this ride?

250
00:14:56,153 --> 00:14:57,850
I can't go on a cross-country trip.

251
00:14:57,923 --> 00:14:59,984
I can't walk away
from work anytime I want.

252
00:15:00,061 --> 00:15:02,464
Yeah, you know what,
you're right.

253
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:04,002
It's just as well.

254
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,008
Road trips probably aren't
the best thing for a guy your age.

255
00:15:07,076 --> 00:15:09,410
I mean, it's gotta be
really inconvenient.

256
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,179
Bunch of middle-aged guys
having to get off their bikes

257
00:15:12,253 --> 00:15:13,916
every 20 minutes to take a pee...

258
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:17,156
My age? What kind of crack is that?
What's wrong with my age?

259
00:15:17,229 --> 00:15:19,324
She talks like I'm not
right here, you know?

260
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,029
Doug, I'm joking.

261
00:15:21,104 --> 00:15:24,235
No, you know what I think?
I think you think I'm a boring guy.

262
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:26,611
I'm old and I'm boring now.
I've become lame.

263
00:15:26,682 --> 00:15:29,313
I think everybody thinks that
at this table. I'm lame!

264
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:31,654
- Admit it! I'm lame!
- Doug, calm down. It's OK.

265
00:15:31,725 --> 00:15:34,288
No, I'm not gonna calm down.
You know what I think?

266
00:15:34,364 --> 00:15:37,359
"Calming down" means
another word for "lame!"

267
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:40,968
I'm not lame!
You know, I'm wild and free!

268
00:15:41,045 --> 00:15:43,208
Wild and free and a man, yeah!

269
00:15:43,282 --> 00:15:46,186
A man that likes to eat meat.
I'm tired of not eating meat!

270
00:15:46,255 --> 00:15:48,522
Meat's good!
Good for men.

271
00:15:48,594 --> 00:15:52,328
And potatoes. I like
potatoes and I like gravy

272
00:15:52,401 --> 00:15:55,965
on my potatoes. Yum, yum!

273
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:02,950
- Don't make sudden moves.
- I'm living wild, living good.

274
00:16:03,023 --> 00:16:05,391
- It feels good, baby!
- Whoa, no, Dad. Your LDL.

275
00:16:05,461 --> 00:16:08,331
Butt out, LDLs! I miss butter.
You know why I miss butter?

276
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,566
The French think butter
is just like cheese, they eat it...

277
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,203
They eat it just like this.
Right off the stick.

278
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:18,151
And the French, who've never won
a major battle, they know how to eat!

279
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,156
And I...

280
00:16:20,224 --> 00:16:22,889
I am living,
and it feels great!

281
00:16:26,337 --> 00:16:28,135
Mmm...

282
00:16:29,008 --> 00:16:31,001
Hmm.

283
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,575
Doug, are you OK?

284
00:16:34,653 --> 00:16:36,054
Doug, you OK?

285
00:16:36,123 --> 00:16:39,027
- Yeah! I'm all right...
- Dad, just spit it out!

286
00:16:39,096 --> 00:16:40,325
Spit it out! Come on.

287
00:16:40,398 --> 00:16:42,334
- Breathe, breathe!
- I am not all right.

288
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,839
- Well, Mr. Madsen...
- Dr. Madsen...

289
00:16:47,914 --> 00:16:51,318
Oh, really? Great. Then I can
put this a little more simply.

290
00:16:51,388 --> 00:16:56,125
You had a catecholamine-induced,
super-ventricular tachyarrhythmia.

291
00:16:56,197 --> 00:16:59,728
I'm actually a dentist, so I
have no idea what you just said.

292
00:16:59,804 --> 00:17:02,435
- Stress-induced panic attack.
- I'm not stressed.

293
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:05,744
Your body says otherwise.
We see this a lot in middle-aged men.

294
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,880
- I'm not middle-aged.
- We hear that a lot, too.

295
00:17:08,957 --> 00:17:11,223
How 'bout we get you
out of here in a few minutes?

296
00:17:11,294 --> 00:17:13,925
<i>Dr. Wesley to imaging.
Dr. Wesley to imaging.</i>

297
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,663
I am a middle-aged man,
aren't I?

298
00:17:15,737 --> 00:17:19,267
Only mathematically.

299
00:17:19,344 --> 00:17:21,907
I think you need to let off some steam.

300
00:17:21,983 --> 00:17:24,146
You used to love to travel.

301
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,657
No, Doug, you used to play hockey.
You were crazy.

302
00:17:26,726 --> 00:17:28,958
You don't even
sing annoying eighties music.

303
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,397
Well, it's different now.

304
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:33,803
You know, I had to slow down
for... for you and Billy.

305
00:17:33,873 --> 00:17:35,775
Oh, so I'm the one
who did this to you?

306
00:17:35,844 --> 00:17:36,904
I'm in a hospital.

307
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,952
It's easier for me now to blame
other people for my problems.

308
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:44,290
W... I think you should
go on that trip.

309
00:17:44,361 --> 00:17:47,424
If you don't, I will fire up
the hog and go with the guys.

310
00:17:47,502 --> 00:17:50,337
- Woody doesn't have a plan.
- Yeah, but he never does.

311
00:17:50,408 --> 00:17:52,309
It's like taking a trip to nowhere.

312
00:17:53,681 --> 00:17:55,913
Maybe that's exactly what you need.

313
00:18:02,098 --> 00:18:03,862
What up?

314
00:18:03,935 --> 00:18:08,069
Hey. You're late! Supposed to
be here at eight-thirty, guys.

315
00:18:08,143 --> 00:18:11,115
Hey, look here,
if Karen calls,

316
00:18:11,183 --> 00:18:15,648
OK, I'm at a toilet
bowl seminar in Cleveland.

317
00:18:15,726 --> 00:18:18,128
Hey, no, I'm serious.

318
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:19,689
I need y'all to cover for me.

319
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:21,862
Yeah, sure.

320
00:18:22,873 --> 00:18:25,743
What? What?
What are you looking at?

321
00:18:25,812 --> 00:18:26,939
I got a tat.

322
00:18:27,015 --> 00:18:28,780
- Come on!
- Hell just froze over.

323
00:18:28,852 --> 00:18:31,187
- Let's see it!
- I'm a biker, dude!

324
00:18:31,257 --> 00:18:32,885
I got a tat!

325
00:18:32,961 --> 00:18:35,933
- It's an apple.
- Uh, Dudley, you know...

326
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,336
I know: Trademarked.
But what are they gonna say?

327
00:18:39,407 --> 00:18:42,311
It's in my skin, bitch!

328
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,685
- You guys aren't gonna wear helmets?
- I don't wanna wear a helmet.

329
00:18:47,757 --> 00:18:50,250
Maybe I don't want anything
between me and the road.

330
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:51,958
You will if your head falls on it.

331
00:18:52,032 --> 00:18:55,267
Woody, 62 percent of motorcycle
fatalities can be prevented with

332
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,674
- the use of an approved DOT helmet.
- That right?

333
00:18:57,744 --> 00:19:01,013
What's that leather condom
gonna protect you from? Snoopy?

334
00:19:01,085 --> 00:19:02,883
The Red Baron? How about dating?

335
00:19:02,955 --> 00:19:04,856
- You told me you liked it.
- Guys, hey!

336
00:19:04,926 --> 00:19:08,764
There are no rules on this trip.
We're just heading for the Pacific,

337
00:19:08,834 --> 00:19:12,238
- and there ain't no plans.
- Well, we got a week to do this, right?

338
00:19:12,307 --> 00:19:14,402
I figure we gotta be
in Illinois by tonight.

339
00:19:14,478 --> 00:19:17,041
Well, the way I mapped it out,
we should be 100 miles

340
00:19:17,117 --> 00:19:19,314
- past St. Louis by sundown.
- Good.

341
00:19:19,389 --> 00:19:21,916
What did I say?
I said it's the open road, OK?

342
00:19:21,993 --> 00:19:25,124
- Who knows where we're gonna be?
- I know where we're gonna be.

343
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,693
Dudley hooked me up.
Check out this thing.

344
00:19:27,772 --> 00:19:29,503
It's a GPS in my phone now.

345
00:19:29,575 --> 00:19:31,442
- Look at that.
- No kidding? Let me see.

346
00:19:31,513 --> 00:19:32,845
- Cool!
- What are you...

347
00:19:33,717 --> 00:19:36,450
- Hey, what'd you do that for?!
- For the good of the trip.

348
00:19:36,523 --> 00:19:39,427
You don't need a GPS
to discover America.

349
00:19:39,495 --> 00:19:41,522
You need a bike and
you need the road, OK?

350
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:44,366
Freedom. And if we have an
emergency, I got a cell phone.

351
00:19:44,439 --> 00:19:45,669
- No you don't.
- What?

352
00:19:45,742 --> 00:19:49,146
Hey! Why did you do that?
I got all my data in there!

353
00:19:49,215 --> 00:19:51,413
Well, how does that feel, Woody?

354
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:55,260
Feels good. Whoo!

355
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:57,821
<i># It's my prerogative!
Mm-mm-mm! #</i>

356
00:19:57,899 --> 00:19:59,562
- No cell phones!
- Wait a minute.

357
00:19:59,636 --> 00:20:01,902
- Come on, get rid of it.
- No, Doug, he's right.

358
00:20:01,975 --> 00:20:04,275
- No, no, wait, wait...
- Whoo!

359
00:20:04,346 --> 00:20:07,409
Yeah! Yeah, Wild Hogs, baby!
Wild Hogs!

360
00:20:07,486 --> 00:20:09,456
You did that so
Karen wouldn't call you.

361
00:20:09,523 --> 00:20:11,049
- Exactly.
- Come on, give it up.

362
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:14,931
So we're not gonna discuss this? We're
not gonna think about this? No, don't!

363
00:20:15,001 --> 00:20:16,766
- We need one phone.
- Freedom, baby!

364
00:20:19,644 --> 00:20:22,810
We gotta go.

365
00:20:24,287 --> 00:20:26,416
- Go, go!
- Come back here!

366
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,466
<i>[# Grand Funk Railroad: Walk Like A Man</i>

367
00:20:30,466 --> 00:20:32,436
<i>[# Grand Funk Railroad: Walk Like A Man</i>

368
00:20:54,448 --> 00:20:55,848
- Hey!
- Whoo!

369
00:20:55,917 --> 00:20:57,318
Where're you guys headed?

370
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,186
I love you!

371
00:21:03,099 --> 00:21:05,160
You're hot!

372
00:21:24,943 --> 00:21:27,540
- Losers.
- Look at these guys.

373
00:21:29,586 --> 00:21:30,884
Hey.

374
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:34,486
You guys wanna a ride?

375
00:21:38,003 --> 00:21:40,702
Well, all right.
Sleeping bags are all set.

376
00:21:43,782 --> 00:21:46,913
Bobby, I got two words
for you: Foot pump.

377
00:21:46,988 --> 00:21:50,723
Woody, I got four words for you:
Got a cheap-ass wife.

378
00:21:52,065 --> 00:21:55,835
Hey, guys, this is poop.
So don't eat it.

379
00:21:55,906 --> 00:21:58,070
- Oh, God.
- Excuse me, Mr. Hard Drive,

380
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,478
you're supposed to bury it,
not put it in a bag.

381
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:03,112
This is plastic,
I'm not gonna put it in the earth.

382
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:04,987
I'll find a garbage can tomorrow.

383
00:22:06,829 --> 00:22:10,633
So you gonna sit right next to me
with that doo-doo.

384
00:22:12,574 --> 00:22:15,238
Hey, come on.
Doesn't get any better than this.

385
00:22:15,312 --> 00:22:19,218
Sitting around a fire, chilling with
your best friends, relaxing, enjoying...

386
00:22:19,286 --> 00:22:21,553
Sorry, you gotta...
You gotta bury that thing.

387
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:24,654
- Otherwise I'll vomit in your lap.
...each other's company.

388
00:22:24,731 --> 00:22:27,328
I'll hang it from a tree
so the bears don't get it.

389
00:22:27,404 --> 00:22:30,035
- No, don't hang it in a tree!
- Why not?

390
00:22:30,109 --> 00:22:34,049
'Cause bears don't eat shit!

391
00:22:39,227 --> 00:22:40,525
What's up?

392
00:22:42,267 --> 00:22:44,761
Ever wake up and wonder
what happened to your life?

393
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:47,670
I really had such great plans.

394
00:22:47,745 --> 00:22:51,617
My life and my work
would be an adventure. You know?

395
00:22:51,686 --> 00:22:53,588
All of a sudden
I'm a suburban dentist.

396
00:22:53,657 --> 00:22:55,559
Hey, look, Doug,
I feel your pain, man.

397
00:22:55,627 --> 00:22:58,531
Look, I swore I would
never return to a job

398
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,766
where I had to wear
condoms on my shoes.

399
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,469
- You're still at The Firm?
- Yeah.

400
00:23:03,543 --> 00:23:07,074
And I get yelled at
by an ungrateful wife all night.

401
00:23:07,151 --> 00:23:10,123
- The whole thing has made me...
- A wimp.

402
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:13,721
I was gonna say miserable.
But you think I'm a wimp?

403
00:23:13,798 --> 00:23:16,668
No, I thought you were gonna say wimp,
so I just filled it in.

404
00:23:16,737 --> 00:23:19,470
You're a wimp, Bobby.
I... I'll say it.

405
00:23:19,543 --> 00:23:22,811
I mean, you're afraid of women.
It's kind of embarrassing.

406
00:23:22,883 --> 00:23:25,514
- I'm afraid of women.
- You're afraid to talk to women.

407
00:23:25,588 --> 00:23:27,148
Bobby's afraid they'll kill him

408
00:23:27,225 --> 00:23:29,491
in his sleep.

409
00:23:29,563 --> 00:23:32,797
Wow. Now I'm really
afraid of women.

410
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,999
At least one of us
is living the fairy tale.

411
00:23:35,074 --> 00:23:37,601
Right, Woody? Plenty of money,
travel all the time,

412
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,512
you got the swimsuit model
for a wife.

413
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:41,577
At least one of us
has got it made.

414
00:23:41,655 --> 00:23:44,821
Yeah, Well, one man's fairy tale
is another man's nightmare.

415
00:23:46,431 --> 00:23:48,833
You think that the
marshmallow's done, Doug?

416
00:23:48,902 --> 00:23:53,138
Oh. Hey, look at that. Anybody
want the first marshmallow?

417
00:23:53,212 --> 00:23:56,047
Starting to look like
Dudley's helmet.

418
00:23:58,121 --> 00:23:59,111
All right.

419
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:03,697
- I think I'm halfway there.
- Oh, in only one hour?

420
00:24:03,765 --> 00:24:05,632
Hey, Bobby, you sure
you wanna do that?

421
00:24:05,703 --> 00:24:08,676
You could use one of the spare
bags we got in the... tent!

422
00:24:08,743 --> 00:24:11,179
Hey, Dudley, go get
the water jug out of my bag!

423
00:24:11,248 --> 00:24:13,184
I want... Kick, kick,
kick, kick! Dirt!

424
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:14,345
I got it!

425
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,550
That's camp-stove fuel!

426
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:19,991
No!

427
00:24:21,134 --> 00:24:22,433
This is the wrong jug!

428
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:23,836
You think?

429
00:24:24,808 --> 00:24:25,867
Aw, God.

430
00:24:25,944 --> 00:24:27,971
This is supposed to be flame-retardant.

431
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:30,042
I guess it wasn't
"Dudley-retardant."

432
00:24:32,491 --> 00:24:34,894
All my drawers are burning.

433
00:24:36,867 --> 00:24:38,460
Oh, perfect!

434
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,795
What are you doing?

435
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:57,102
Huh? Keeping my face
out of the wind.

436
00:24:58,477 --> 00:25:03,146
Hey. Oh.
Boy, my ass is sore.

437
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,746
Mine, too.

438
00:25:04,824 --> 00:25:07,921
It's Woody's fault
for riding us so hard yesterday.

439
00:25:07,996 --> 00:25:11,993
The human body wasn't made to straddle
something that big for that long.

440
00:25:12,071 --> 00:25:16,239
Well, you know, it's gonna hurt a little
bit, and that's part of the experience.

441
00:25:16,313 --> 00:25:18,215
That's why we didn't bring our wives.

442
00:25:18,284 --> 00:25:20,686
What the...
What the hell?

443
00:25:20,756 --> 00:25:24,355
Somebody wanna explain to me
why I'm the one in the dirt...

444
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:27,231
...when I got sore jaws
from three hours of blowing...

445
00:25:29,306 --> 00:25:34,248
Please, please for the love
of God, finish your sentence.

446
00:25:38,158 --> 00:25:39,889
Let's see, what, uh...

447
00:25:39,961 --> 00:25:41,555
What exactly
do we have here?

448
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,964
We've got...

449
00:25:43,034 --> 00:25:47,874
...one, two, three men...
in a bed... spooning?

450
00:25:47,944 --> 00:25:49,538
This is not what it looks like.

451
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:52,552
This is a, uh... We, um...
What is it, Woody?

452
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,610
Camping.

453
00:25:53,689 --> 00:25:56,855
I'll tell you just exactly
what it is there, Poindexter.

454
00:25:56,929 --> 00:25:59,799
It is four counts
of indecent exposure,

455
00:25:59,868 --> 00:26:03,035
two counts of lewd,
lascivious behavior, and...

456
00:26:03,944 --> 00:26:07,576
...one count...
of pure jealousy.

457
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:11,112
- Huh?
- How you doing?

458
00:26:11,191 --> 00:26:12,751
- Hey, look.
- Whoa, we're not...

459
00:26:12,828 --> 00:26:14,695
Thanks for waking us up,
Officer.

460
00:26:14,765 --> 00:26:18,261
- Oh, it was actually...
- I get it. You gotta get going.

461
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,467
That's terrific.

462
00:26:19,542 --> 00:26:21,808
Five's a crowd? Is that
what I'm gleaning here?

463
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,285
Yeah, five's... uneven number.
Figure it out.

464
00:26:25,354 --> 00:26:27,824
You guys can't see it, can you?
You're too close.

465
00:26:27,892 --> 00:26:31,388
You don't realize how lucky
you are to have each other.

466
00:26:31,466 --> 00:26:35,497
Oh, daddy... Damn lucky.

467
00:26:37,344 --> 00:26:40,214
- I've always felt so.
- I know what you've felt.

468
00:26:40,284 --> 00:26:42,585
I have too.

469
00:26:55,014 --> 00:26:58,009
- You wearing pants?
- No.

470
00:26:58,087 --> 00:27:00,785
Would you please put some
pants on, for God's sake!

471
00:27:00,859 --> 00:27:02,487
Dudley!

472
00:27:02,562 --> 00:27:03,929
What a nice guy.

473
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:08,803
Mmm.
Oh, yeah.

474
00:27:09,811 --> 00:27:11,804
Whoo! Anybody else
gotta take a leak?

475
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:13,076
- No.
- No.

476
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:15,313
Hey, guys, last
stop for quite a while.

477
00:27:15,389 --> 00:27:18,793
I gotta pee again now.

478
00:28:07,127 --> 00:28:10,293
Wow. I can
smell them from here.

479
00:28:10,366 --> 00:28:13,999
Gentlemen,
that's the real deal.

480
00:28:45,305 --> 00:28:46,466
Ahh.

481
00:28:47,576 --> 00:28:49,135
What?

482
00:28:50,348 --> 00:28:54,049
Now, that's "wild!"

483
00:29:17,069 --> 00:29:19,165
Oh! Whoa, stop it!

484
00:29:19,241 --> 00:29:21,234
Biker in trouble!

485
00:29:41,953 --> 00:29:43,650
This is awesome!

486
00:29:46,562 --> 00:29:49,193
Thanks for
waiting for me, jerks!

487
00:29:49,769 --> 00:29:51,864
Yoo-hoo!

488
00:29:53,143 --> 00:29:55,773
Oh, it's...
Whoa, it's cold!

489
00:29:57,084 --> 00:29:59,714
- What?
- Why are you naked?

490
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:02,420
We're swimming. Did you guys
keep your skivvies on?

491
00:30:02,494 --> 00:30:04,795
There could be snapping
turtles or something.

492
00:30:04,866 --> 00:30:07,804
I kept mine on 'cause I didn't
want it to get dark in here.

493
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:10,969
I don't know, I thought we were
doing this wild and free thing.

494
00:30:11,045 --> 00:30:12,206
Yeah, well...

495
00:30:14,051 --> 00:30:16,522
More like, old and lame,
isn't it?

496
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:19,391
The high guy would've just
ripped 'em right off, you know,

497
00:30:19,463 --> 00:30:21,660
back in the... back in the day.

498
00:30:21,734 --> 00:30:24,969
- But the day's today, isn't it?
- This isn't necessary.

499
00:30:25,041 --> 00:30:28,741
Yeah, come on.
Come on! Huh?

500
00:30:30,284 --> 00:30:33,450
Now you see what you started?
You even got Doug out of his drawers.

501
00:30:33,524 --> 00:30:35,517
What the hell,
you know what I mean?

502
00:30:35,596 --> 00:30:37,394
But everybody
keep their distance.

503
00:30:37,465 --> 00:30:40,700
I don't want the whole size
thing to ruin our friendship.

504
00:30:40,773 --> 00:30:43,768
Launching mine.
Over your head, baby.

505
00:30:43,845 --> 00:30:45,838
Whew. You guys are nuts.

506
00:30:51,194 --> 00:30:53,027
Come on! Huh?

507
00:30:53,098 --> 00:30:57,732
Fine. I will
get naked with my gay friends,

508
00:30:57,807 --> 00:31:01,110
and if any of them look at
my junk, I will kill them.

509
00:31:04,454 --> 00:31:06,857
Gentlemen, these are
the good old days.

510
00:31:14,675 --> 00:31:17,009
Come on, kids!
Come on!

511
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:19,312
- Whoo!
- Oh, no.

512
00:31:19,384 --> 00:31:21,149
Last one in
smells like Uncle Eddie!

513
00:31:21,222 --> 00:31:22,884
Aw, hell no.

514
00:31:22,958 --> 00:31:26,227
Hope you guys don't mind company.
Minivan was getting crowded.

515
00:31:26,298 --> 00:31:30,295
There's a much shallower creek
for kids just up the canyon a bit.

516
00:31:30,373 --> 00:31:31,967
Oh, no, my kids like to dive.

517
00:31:32,043 --> 00:31:33,842
Marky, show this guy your dive.

518
00:31:33,914 --> 00:31:37,080
If you put your arms out, he
does a backflip right into them.

519
00:31:37,154 --> 00:31:39,124
No! Don't do that,
it's not a good idea.

520
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:40,751
Oh, hello.

521
00:31:40,828 --> 00:31:42,559
You gentlemen like potato salad?

522
00:31:42,632 --> 00:31:43,793
We've got extra.

523
00:31:43,867 --> 00:31:46,202
But, uh, you might wanna
eat that way over there.

524
00:31:46,273 --> 00:31:48,175
Uh, less ants and snakes.

525
00:31:48,243 --> 00:31:50,236
The kids are coming.
The kids are coming.

526
00:31:50,314 --> 00:31:52,341
No... Oh, whoa. Guys,
you can't swim here.

527
00:31:52,418 --> 00:31:54,888
Crawfish, big crawfish,
they're snapping... Ow!

528
00:31:54,957 --> 00:31:56,448
Crawfish!

529
00:31:56,526 --> 00:31:58,086
Lemme see if I can catch one!

530
00:31:59,098 --> 00:32:01,398
You see? He's
looking for crawfish!

531
00:32:01,469 --> 00:32:03,371
- I told you!
- He's gonna find a couple!

532
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,807
Where is he?

533
00:32:09,753 --> 00:32:12,019
Marky! Cooper! Ava!

534
00:32:12,091 --> 00:32:14,061
Let's, uh, let's get
out of the water.

535
00:32:14,128 --> 00:32:16,098
- Find a new spot.
- Why, Hugh?

536
00:32:16,166 --> 00:32:18,033
This is such a nice...

537
00:32:19,106 --> 00:32:21,167
Oh, my God.

538
00:32:21,244 --> 00:32:24,080
- I didn't wanna do this.
- Out of the water! Now!

539
00:32:24,149 --> 00:32:25,583
Kids, listen to your dad.

540
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,451
- No!
- Aw! We just got here!

541
00:32:27,522 --> 00:32:30,619
Get out of the damn water, now!
Run! Run! Run! Go!

542
00:32:30,696 --> 00:32:34,191
Take it. Take it! What's wrong
with these people? Come on, go!

543
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:36,935
I'll bet her potato salad
was really good.

544
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,444
- Maybe we should go.
- Yeah, let's go.

545
00:32:41,518 --> 00:32:42,918
Why? They ain't coming back!

546
00:32:42,987 --> 00:32:48,260
Fellas!
Forget about them!

547
00:32:48,332 --> 00:32:52,363
More room for us, huh?
Come on!

548
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,344
You like what you see?
Huh? Let's get involved!

549
00:33:02,093 --> 00:33:05,156
Whoo! Now that's
what I'm talking about!

550
00:33:05,232 --> 00:33:06,667
Whoo!

551
00:33:06,736 --> 00:33:10,038
I saw your bikes
over there and I...

552
00:33:11,846 --> 00:33:13,782
Chicken fights, fellas?

553
00:33:14,885 --> 00:33:17,322
No? Plan B...

554
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,757
- Marco...
- Polo.

555
00:33:20,831 --> 00:33:23,701
Mar... Marco...

556
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:27,574
Marco!

557
00:33:53,932 --> 00:33:55,628
Thank you so much!

558
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:59,300
And, uh, I left
a window open, all right?

559
00:34:37,754 --> 00:34:41,387
Oh, yeah.
Now, this is a biker bar.

560
00:34:41,462 --> 00:34:43,364
I'm buying, let's go.

561
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:48,704
I hope they have bran muffins.
I'm a little bound up.

562
00:34:53,553 --> 00:34:56,423
My damn leg's asleep!

563
00:34:56,492 --> 00:34:58,553
Oh, it's got an emblem, too.
An FLH emblem.

564
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:00,531
That is rare, man. Rare.

565
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,504
- Can you see this?
- Oh, man. That's beautiful.

566
00:35:04,676 --> 00:35:06,873
- What's wrong with you?
- My legs are asleep.

567
00:35:19,872 --> 00:35:21,808
How 'bout this one?

568
00:35:21,876 --> 00:35:24,211
Yeah.

569
00:35:25,684 --> 00:35:27,176
You guys want beers?

570
00:35:27,254 --> 00:35:30,385
I gotta find that guy with the
'55 bike, man. It is beautiful.

571
00:35:31,697 --> 00:35:35,501
Nice tat.
Where'd you get it?

572
00:35:35,572 --> 00:35:38,669
Leavenworth. You?

573
00:35:38,745 --> 00:35:40,806
Meadow Hills Galleria.

574
00:35:47,529 --> 00:35:50,797
I don't think I've ever seen
you guys around here before.

575
00:35:51,337 --> 00:35:52,897
What's your, uh...

576
00:35:52,974 --> 00:35:55,342
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Wild Hogs.

577
00:35:55,412 --> 00:35:57,314
That the name
of your little gang?

578
00:35:57,382 --> 00:36:00,548
Not a gang. We're friends
riding from Cincinnati to the coast.

579
00:36:00,623 --> 00:36:02,889
Hey, man. We in your seats?

580
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,896
- No.
- Nah, 'cause we could just...

581
00:36:04,964 --> 00:36:07,527
No. No, no,
n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-no.

582
00:36:07,603 --> 00:36:11,703
...we'll roll out.
- No, n-n-no. No. I insist. Sit.

583
00:36:11,778 --> 00:36:13,144
- Sit?
- Sit. I insist.

584
00:36:13,215 --> 00:36:15,685
I think I'm gonna
join you fellas.

585
00:36:15,753 --> 00:36:17,689
Actually, we have a...

586
00:36:17,757 --> 00:36:19,488
Yeah, let's join them.

587
00:36:19,561 --> 00:36:23,524
Make ourselves some
nice new little friends.

588
00:36:23,602 --> 00:36:25,094
- Nice patch.
- Yeah.

589
00:36:25,172 --> 00:36:28,042
Did you get your grandmother
to needlepoint that for you?

590
00:36:28,112 --> 00:36:31,107
Well, what's... what's going on
with you there, uh, Cochise?

591
00:36:31,184 --> 00:36:32,949
What's your story?

592
00:36:40,537 --> 00:36:43,064
Wh... What is that
supposed to be? Is he blind?

593
00:36:43,142 --> 00:36:44,873
He wasn't when he
walked in here.

594
00:36:44,945 --> 00:36:46,574
Hey! I'm talking to you!

595
00:36:46,649 --> 00:36:49,120
- You hear me?
- He can hear fine.

596
00:36:49,188 --> 00:36:51,658
Look, we're...
We don't want any trouble.

597
00:36:51,726 --> 00:36:55,097
I do.

598
00:36:55,167 --> 00:36:59,301
Actually, that's what
I'm looking forward to the most.

599
00:37:00,443 --> 00:37:02,436
That's what he's
looking forward to!

600
00:37:02,514 --> 00:37:05,681
I heard him say that. I heard him.

601
00:37:08,394 --> 00:37:09,453
Shut up.

602
00:37:12,368 --> 00:37:14,429
All right.

603
00:37:14,506 --> 00:37:16,999
You're looking for trouble?

604
00:37:19,316 --> 00:37:21,309
You gotta be careful
about Bobby here.

605
00:37:21,386 --> 00:37:23,219
His temper's like
a Roman candle.

606
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:25,955
Man...
That's a damn lie!

607
00:37:26,029 --> 00:37:28,522
On the other hand,
Woody over here,

608
00:37:28,601 --> 00:37:31,129
you get him mad,
people get broke.

609
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:34,238
Doug makes kids cry.

610
00:37:34,312 --> 00:37:37,182
- What?
- Yeah. You make kids cry.

611
00:37:37,252 --> 00:37:38,653
You made my child cry.

612
00:37:38,722 --> 00:37:40,658
Your kid was crying
before she got to me.

613
00:37:40,726 --> 00:37:43,128
Yeah. But I asked you
to give her a lollipop. Be...

614
00:37:43,198 --> 00:37:45,430
- It calms her down.
- You can't give a lolli...

615
00:37:45,502 --> 00:37:47,972
- All right, shut up!
- You know what?

616
00:37:48,041 --> 00:37:49,907
I think we better get out of here.

617
00:37:49,978 --> 00:37:52,608
No. We'll get
out of here at sundown.

618
00:37:52,683 --> 00:37:54,516
After we've had our beverage.

619
00:37:54,587 --> 00:37:57,115
Sundown, Hoss? What?

620
00:37:57,192 --> 00:38:02,430
These are on me. You got
the mocha lattes yesterday.

621
00:38:02,504 --> 00:38:04,166
- Ah...
- Hey, brother.

622
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,909
- Another Wild Hog!
- Yep.

623
00:38:08,983 --> 00:38:11,978
Yep-er-oonie.
That's our gang.

624
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:16,293
Hey, uh, who owns that
'48 Panhead outside?

625
00:38:16,365 --> 00:38:17,958
Uh, that's my '48.

626
00:38:18,035 --> 00:38:20,130
Sweet ride.

627
00:38:20,206 --> 00:38:24,112
And I'm sick of it.
How 'bout a trade there, brother?

628
00:38:24,181 --> 00:38:26,651
- Dudley. Dudley, Dudley.
- Oh. I wish.

629
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,282
I'm just on a Sportster.
Worth half of what yours is.

630
00:38:29,358 --> 00:38:31,522
A Sportster?
I grew up on a Sportster!

631
00:38:31,596 --> 00:38:33,498
I've been wanting another Sportster!

632
00:38:33,567 --> 00:38:36,060
Oh? No, no, no.
It's even better than that.

633
00:38:36,138 --> 00:38:38,040
In the gas tank
is one of my shoelaces.

634
00:38:38,109 --> 00:38:41,674
I dropped it in there when I was
trying to get my calculator watch out.

635
00:38:42,551 --> 00:38:44,076
- Dudley?
- Dudley.

636
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,318
Dudley...
You got a deal.

637
00:38:46,393 --> 00:38:49,992
- Seriously? You're serious?
- Think. He's not gonna trade the bike.

638
00:38:50,067 --> 00:38:52,299
Dudley, I wanna see
what you look like on that.

639
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:54,068
You're on.

640
00:38:54,142 --> 00:38:56,635
Ah! Dudley!
Dudley, no. No, wait a minute.

641
00:38:56,714 --> 00:38:58,239
We gotta trade...

642
00:38:58,316 --> 00:38:59,945
Yo, check this out.

643
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,924
Does anybody else get
that "pre-rape" feeling?

644
00:39:02,993 --> 00:39:06,899
I do.

645
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:12,177
Oh, oh, this is great!

646
00:39:12,245 --> 00:39:14,545
No, no, no, no, no, no.
This is Joker's Panhead.

647
00:39:14,616 --> 00:39:16,609
I thought we were
talking about this one.

648
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,520
Hey, your Panhead is over here.

649
00:39:18,591 --> 00:39:20,458
Oh. I was talking about...

650
00:39:20,528 --> 00:39:23,227
Nah, no, no, no, no.
I got a better one for you.

651
00:39:23,301 --> 00:39:26,797
It's right over here.
The red one, the Panhead.

652
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:28,343
- Where?
- Right there.

653
00:39:28,411 --> 00:39:30,678
That's a Panhead.
There're no other Panheads.

654
00:39:30,749 --> 00:39:31,944
- That?
- Yeah.

655
00:39:32,018 --> 00:39:33,715
That's a pile of junk.

656
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:36,420
Yeah. That's your pile of junk.

657
00:39:41,438 --> 00:39:43,965
- This guy's joking you.
- You wanna know the joke?

658
00:39:44,042 --> 00:39:46,673
The joke is suburban assholes
who buy leather outfits

659
00:39:46,748 --> 00:39:50,153
who think they're bikers.
And it's a joke that I'm damn sick of.

660
00:39:50,222 --> 00:39:52,989
You wanna know who
a real biker is? Damien Blade.

661
00:39:53,061 --> 00:39:55,897
He founded the Del Fuegos
and he built this bar

662
00:39:55,967 --> 00:39:58,164
for real bikers, not this!

663
00:39:58,238 --> 00:39:59,798
Hey, we have a right
to be bikers.

664
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:02,506
You don't have any rights.
Shut up! I knew you assholes

665
00:40:02,581 --> 00:40:05,211
the minute I laid eyes on you.
Look at the four of you!

666
00:40:05,286 --> 00:40:07,757
- You don't know us.
- You don't think I know you?

667
00:40:07,824 --> 00:40:10,261
What? You're probably a...
a podiatrist

668
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:12,664
or a ear-nose-and-throat specialist.

669
00:40:12,734 --> 00:40:14,636
- I wish.
- Orthodontist?

670
00:40:14,705 --> 00:40:17,404
Oh. Close enough.

671
00:40:17,477 --> 00:40:20,108
And you, Bobby,
guaranteed you're henpecked.

672
00:40:20,183 --> 00:40:22,984
- Right? Your wife wears the pants.
- You know my wife?

673
00:40:23,056 --> 00:40:25,583
And you, you anal-retentive wimp,

674
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:28,029
guarantee you bag your own shit.

675
00:40:28,099 --> 00:40:29,864
Wow, you're good.

676
00:40:29,936 --> 00:40:32,338
- What color am I thinking of?
- Shut up.

677
00:40:33,577 --> 00:40:35,444
You're the biggest
poser of them all,

678
00:40:36,249 --> 00:40:37,843
aren't you, squinty?

679
00:40:38,754 --> 00:40:41,191
Go home. Just go home.

680
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,730
Go home. You couldn't
handle this freedom anyhow.

681
00:40:43,797 --> 00:40:46,200
Get out of here.
Go back to your safe little lives.

682
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:48,331
Let's get our bikes.
We'll get out of here.

683
00:40:48,407 --> 00:40:50,970
You're not listening.
I'm taking your friend's bike

684
00:40:51,046 --> 00:40:53,209
and you guys are gonna
hit the road and go back

685
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:56,085
to wherever the hell it is
that you came from. Understand?

686
00:40:56,156 --> 00:40:58,251
We're gonna have to
work something out.

687
00:40:58,327 --> 00:41:01,892
All right.
Let's work something out.

688
00:41:16,731 --> 00:41:19,794
Hey! What's going on?
Something break?

689
00:41:19,871 --> 00:41:22,809
- What's up, man? What's up?
- This is bullshit, man.

690
00:41:22,877 --> 00:41:25,109
We should go back there
and get Dudley's bike.

691
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:27,482
That's why we're stopping?
What are you, nuts?

692
00:41:27,553 --> 00:41:28,954
We're gonna call the police.

693
00:41:29,023 --> 00:41:30,890
I gotta borrow somebody's cell phone.

694
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,987
Einstein had us
throw 'em away, remember?

695
00:41:33,064 --> 00:41:34,829
Hey, look, man,
damn the bike.

696
00:41:34,901 --> 00:41:37,304
He's gonna have to roll
with that little sidecar.

697
00:41:37,374 --> 00:41:39,469
- Right.
- Let's get up outta here, man.

698
00:41:39,544 --> 00:41:43,143
Come on. The trip is over 'cause
some tattooed bullies pushed us around?

699
00:41:43,219 --> 00:41:44,380
Yeah.

700
00:41:45,823 --> 00:41:46,813
I go where you go.

701
00:41:46,892 --> 00:41:48,589
Good. See? He's got balls.

702
00:41:48,662 --> 00:41:50,895
No. I mean my sidecar's
attached to your bike.

703
00:41:50,968 --> 00:41:53,769
I'd rather turn back.
But, honestly, how far could I roll?

704
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,331
I'm not gonna
let this happen.

705
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:57,243
I say we go back
and we get his bike.

706
00:41:57,313 --> 00:41:58,543
- You?
- Yeah.

707
00:41:58,617 --> 00:42:02,181
Who died and elected you pope? This
isn't about Dudley, this is about you.

708
00:42:02,257 --> 00:42:05,058
You, you. All through high school
it's always about you,

709
00:42:05,129 --> 00:42:06,894
- and I am sick of it!
- Oh, screw you.

710
00:42:06,966 --> 00:42:08,731
It's not my fault
you hate your life.

711
00:42:08,804 --> 00:42:11,742
- I love my life. Why do you...?
- Let me tell you something!

712
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:13,973
This trip's supposed
to be about adventure!

713
00:42:14,048 --> 00:42:17,179
But no. You're too busy dragging
your baggage to let that happen.

714
00:42:17,254 --> 00:42:19,121
Well, thank you, Dr. Freud.

715
00:42:19,192 --> 00:42:21,128
Look, I'm not going back
to get that bike

716
00:42:21,196 --> 00:42:23,724
to satisfy your bruised ego.
Are you guys with me?

717
00:42:23,801 --> 00:42:25,703
- Oh, I'm with you.
- Yeah, I agree.

718
00:42:25,772 --> 00:42:28,504
There you go, Woody.
We're not going back there with you.

719
00:42:28,578 --> 00:42:30,878
Should we go after him?

720
00:42:30,949 --> 00:42:32,418
Probably.

721
00:42:32,486 --> 00:42:34,979
- Are we going to?
- Nope.

722
00:43:33,776 --> 00:43:36,304
Come after us now, assholes.

723
00:43:56,355 --> 00:43:58,792
- I'll be a son of a gun.
- Oh, snap!

724
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:01,966
You did it!
You got her back!

725
00:44:02,034 --> 00:44:04,369
- Woo-hoo!
- Ha-ha!

726
00:44:04,439 --> 00:44:05,702
Who's your daddy?!

727
00:44:05,775 --> 00:44:08,269
- You are my daddy!
- Yeah, that's right, baby.

728
00:44:08,347 --> 00:44:10,283
Aw, man!

729
00:44:10,351 --> 00:44:12,583
- Thank you!
- How'd you do it?

730
00:44:12,655 --> 00:44:15,286
OK, they were
totally pissed off.

731
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:17,593
So I take a new tact. Reality.

732
00:44:17,665 --> 00:44:20,466
So I said to 'em,
"OK, assault us. No problem.

733
00:44:20,538 --> 00:44:22,167
Because we may not be
real bikers,

734
00:44:22,241 --> 00:44:24,804
but we know real lawyers.
And as soon as you touch us,

735
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,407
we'll sue you for everything
you got and everything

736
00:44:27,485 --> 00:44:29,547
you're gonna have."
And they backed down.

737
00:44:29,623 --> 00:44:31,684
They totally backed down.
It was awesome.

738
00:44:31,761 --> 00:44:33,731
- You really said that?
- Yeah!

739
00:44:33,798 --> 00:44:35,232
My man!

740
00:44:35,302 --> 00:44:37,795
- Show me love. Show me love.
- Yeah!

741
00:44:37,873 --> 00:44:40,436
Hey, guess what.
The trip's back on.

742
00:44:40,512 --> 00:44:41,980
- It's back on!
- The trip is on!

743
00:44:42,049 --> 00:44:44,076
Wait. We're gonna
go back that way, then?

744
00:44:44,153 --> 00:44:45,416
Yeah, they don't care.

745
00:44:45,489 --> 00:44:49,054
We should just do it before
they change their minds.

746
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:52,102
- Pacific Ocean, here we come!
- Whoo!

747
00:44:52,169 --> 00:44:54,571
<i>Highway to Hell]</i>

748
00:45:04,761 --> 00:45:07,995
Son of a bitch.
Come on. Come on!

749
00:45:26,271 --> 00:45:28,469
Thanks, guys!

750
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:36,548
Those assholes got balls.

751
00:45:36,626 --> 00:45:39,325
That I'm gonna put in
my mouth and chew on!

752
00:45:40,667 --> 00:45:43,104
You're gonna put what
in your mouth?

753
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:48,080
Come on! Del Fuegos,
let's smoke those hogs!

754
00:45:48,149 --> 00:45:49,914
- Let's go!
- Come on!

755
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,503
What the hell...?
Aw, shit!

756
00:46:01,577 --> 00:46:04,845
Fire, fire!
Fire, everybody.

757
00:46:04,917 --> 00:46:06,614
Hey! Fire,
come on, get off!

758
00:46:06,687 --> 00:46:07,916
Fire, fire!
Get away.

759
00:46:07,989 --> 00:46:10,016
Come on!

760
00:46:10,094 --> 00:46:12,690
Get out of there!
Get out of there!

761
00:46:28,397 --> 00:46:31,301
Oh, shit!

762
00:46:32,005 --> 00:46:34,841
Oh, God. Oh, no.

763
00:46:37,183 --> 00:46:39,244
Come on. Let's go!

764
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,950
What's your rush?
My balls are still vibrating.

765
00:46:42,026 --> 00:46:44,053
It's... It's the open road, man.

766
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:45,861
It's riding free,
that's the rush.

767
00:46:45,934 --> 00:46:48,029
This isn't freedom,
this is a gas station!

768
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:50,598
Built by the man!
A prison for our souls!

769
00:46:50,677 --> 00:46:52,305
My soul needs
something to drink.

770
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:53,439
I need gas.

771
00:46:53,515 --> 00:46:55,144
We'll get gas at the next station.

772
00:46:55,219 --> 00:46:57,918
Come on, Wild Hogs. Let's go!

773
00:46:57,991 --> 00:47:00,519
Whoo-hoo! Let's ride!

774
00:47:00,597 --> 00:47:02,897
Did I miss the espresso stop?

775
00:47:02,968 --> 00:47:05,872
He's moving.

776
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:08,707
Yahoo!

777
00:47:30,256 --> 00:47:32,021
Woody! You're an asshole.

778
00:47:32,094 --> 00:47:33,859
They should've had
a sign that said,

779
00:47:33,931 --> 00:47:36,334
"Last gas X amount of miles."

780
00:47:40,444 --> 00:47:42,880
I need something to drink.

781
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:45,888
I'm thirsty...
Or else I'm gonna die!

782
00:47:45,956 --> 00:47:49,656
Yeah. You know,
I keep... saving my spit

783
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:51,130
so it's like a drink of water,

784
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:53,294
and it just keeps
tasting like... my spit.

785
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,431
They say you can get

786
00:47:55,509 --> 00:47:58,481
something to drink
out of a cactus, right?

787
00:47:58,548 --> 00:48:00,347
Where are the cactuses?

788
00:48:00,418 --> 00:48:03,082
We're in a desert
that don't have no damn cactuses.

789
00:48:03,157 --> 00:48:04,421
Yeah.

790
00:48:04,493 --> 00:48:08,433
Actually, I think
when it's plural, it's "cacti."

791
00:48:08,501 --> 00:48:10,767
- I'm killing him.
- You're gonna kill him?

792
00:48:10,839 --> 00:48:13,333
We're all thinking it.
Gonna need the nourishment.

793
00:48:13,411 --> 00:48:14,971
He'll put up the least struggle.

794
00:48:15,048 --> 00:48:17,280
- Move out of the way.
- You love Dudley.

795
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:19,549
It's the sun.
It's making us all crazy.

796
00:48:19,623 --> 00:48:23,063
You're right, man.
My... my bad, Dud.

797
00:48:23,131 --> 00:48:25,158
You know, I don't know
what came over me.

798
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:28,731
Dehydration. Your blood's thickening,
so your heart's working harder

799
00:48:28,809 --> 00:48:31,542
to pump it through your arteries.
Less gets to your head.

800
00:48:31,615 --> 00:48:34,246
Our bodies are literally
trying to drink themselves.

801
00:48:34,321 --> 00:48:36,017
All right. I'm killing him.

802
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:38,323
Wait a minute.
They got a sign up here.

803
00:48:38,395 --> 00:48:40,228
Curve of the road.
Read it!

804
00:48:40,299 --> 00:48:43,294
- Madrid? Spain?
- No. It's Madrid.

805
00:48:43,372 --> 00:48:45,399
That's what the locals say.
I Googled it.

806
00:48:45,476 --> 00:48:48,175
Gonna be water, food and gas.

807
00:48:48,249 --> 00:48:52,121
- We're gonna live.
- We gonna live!

808
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:54,684
We gonna live, baby!

809
00:48:58,803 --> 00:49:00,432
It's closed!

810
00:49:00,507 --> 00:49:02,875
Ah, man! It's closed!

811
00:49:02,945 --> 00:49:05,473
But the diner up here...

812
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:08,147
The diner's open!
Come on!

813
00:49:08,223 --> 00:49:11,218
Get me a drink, quick!

814
00:49:11,296 --> 00:49:12,959
- We need water!
- Quick!

815
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:15,435
- Hey! Come on!
- Right here. Right here!

816
00:49:15,504 --> 00:49:16,494
Whoa!

817
00:49:16,572 --> 00:49:20,012
- Oh! Right here! Me!
- Me! Me!

818
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,674
- You?
- Me!

819
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:28,253
- Hey!
- You!

820
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:31,531
They were here three weeks ago.
They're already getting violent.

821
00:49:31,603 --> 00:49:34,039
It's OK, I got it.

822
00:49:38,484 --> 00:49:41,047
- You gentlemen like a seat?
- Is there a booth open?

823
00:49:41,123 --> 00:49:42,922
Let's go!

824
00:49:42,993 --> 00:49:44,393
- Yeah. Uh, what?
- Come on.

825
00:49:45,866 --> 00:49:48,632
- Keep moving!
- Uh, nice town.

826
00:49:52,045 --> 00:49:57,215
So, uh, I...

827
00:49:58,023 --> 00:49:59,583
Uh...

828
00:50:06,674 --> 00:50:10,045
- She is perfect.
- You like the waitress?

829
00:50:10,115 --> 00:50:13,178
Oh, man. I wanted to say
something funny to her,

830
00:50:13,255 --> 00:50:15,191
but all I could think
of was black jokes.

831
00:50:16,327 --> 00:50:19,231
- Like which ones?
- I forget.

832
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:22,933
Why don't you tell the one that ends
with you getting your ass whupped?

833
00:50:23,008 --> 00:50:25,809
- Would that be funny?
- I'll be laughing.

834
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:28,579
Oh, I'll be cracking up.

835
00:50:28,653 --> 00:50:32,559
Oh, it's the law. Oh, boy.

836
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:41,405
- You boys here for the Chile Festival?
- What, you have a problem?

837
00:50:41,479 --> 00:50:44,816
You look like you saw something
explode or something, all right.

838
00:50:44,886 --> 00:50:46,320
We're just passing through.

839
00:50:46,388 --> 00:50:49,987
The people around here
don't want any more trouble.

840
00:50:50,063 --> 00:50:52,591
Now me, I got no problem
with you Del Fuegos

841
00:50:52,668 --> 00:50:55,002
as long as you boys
could stay sober...

842
00:50:55,073 --> 00:50:58,170
No, no. No, we're... we're not
associated with those assholes.

843
00:50:58,246 --> 00:50:59,840
- You're not?
- No.

844
00:50:59,916 --> 00:51:01,442
- For real?
- Yeah.

845
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,924
Folks, they're not Del Fuegos.

846
00:51:07,031 --> 00:51:09,365
Are the Del Fuegos
a problem around here?

847
00:51:09,435 --> 00:51:12,100
Only if you expect 'em
to pay for a meal they just ate

848
00:51:12,174 --> 00:51:13,642
or a beer they just drank.

849
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:15,577
- Won't have problems with us.
- No, no.

850
00:51:15,648 --> 00:51:18,849
- Then welcome to Madrid.
- Excuse me, sheriff?

851
00:51:18,922 --> 00:51:21,051
- Uh, the Del Fuegos?
- Yeah.

852
00:51:21,126 --> 00:51:24,566
OK, now. How often might
they come through this town?

853
00:51:24,633 --> 00:51:26,660
Oh, once every few months.

854
00:51:26,737 --> 00:51:28,205
- Oh?
- Yeah. Yeah.

855
00:51:28,273 --> 00:51:30,767
And... the gas station,
now when would that be open?

856
00:51:30,845 --> 00:51:33,180
That's closed on Sundays.
So tomorrow morning.

857
00:51:33,251 --> 00:51:34,651
Oh, God.

858
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:38,216
But maybe you should seriously
consider spending the night.

859
00:51:38,294 --> 00:51:41,698
Because we're having
the world's hottest chili contest.

860
00:51:41,767 --> 00:51:44,603
The Chile Festival is not
something you wanna miss.

861
00:51:44,673 --> 00:51:47,474
Last year, somebody's throat
actually started to bleed.

862
00:51:47,546 --> 00:51:51,042
Oh, damn!
Somebody's throat started to bleed?

863
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:52,919
Yeah. Changed their life.

864
00:51:52,991 --> 00:51:55,325
It's great. Think about it.

865
00:51:56,765 --> 00:52:00,432
We gotta get out of this town, man.
This town is a drag. We gotta move on.

866
00:52:00,506 --> 00:52:02,840
- We gotta find a way out.
- Woody, chill out, man.

867
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:04,937
We finally get a chance to relax.

868
00:52:05,015 --> 00:52:06,917
Yeah. And being able
to use a bathroom,

869
00:52:06,985 --> 00:52:09,616
- that might be a good idea.
- And I can empty my poop bag.

870
00:52:09,691 --> 00:52:11,661
And you gonna re-use the bag?

871
00:52:11,728 --> 00:52:13,664
Woody, remember
the theme of this trip?

872
00:52:13,732 --> 00:52:15,531
"Whatever," remember?
"Whatever."

873
00:52:15,603 --> 00:52:16,902
OK, fine! Fine.

874
00:52:16,973 --> 00:52:19,774
We'll stay the night,
and we'll get gas in the morning. OK?

875
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:22,315
Calm down.
I don't understand what your rush is.

876
00:52:22,383 --> 00:52:25,116
I'm not in a rush, man.
I just wanna ride, man.

877
00:52:25,189 --> 00:52:26,749
I just wanna ride. You know?

878
00:52:26,826 --> 00:52:29,092
<i># Ride, Sally, ride #</i>

879
00:52:29,164 --> 00:52:32,729
You are so weird. He asks the...
You say the weirdest things, man.

880
00:52:32,805 --> 00:52:36,176
You're like, "We're digging roots,
buying real estate and shit."

881
00:52:36,245 --> 00:52:38,944
Yeah. Why don't you just...

882
00:52:39,018 --> 00:52:41,580
What?! What?

883
00:52:49,639 --> 00:52:51,232
All right, everybody come here.

884
00:52:51,309 --> 00:52:53,211
Come on.

885
00:52:55,551 --> 00:52:57,885
All right.

886
00:52:57,956 --> 00:52:59,448
We're here. Right?

887
00:52:59,526 --> 00:53:02,657
They could be in any of these towns.
Right around here. All right?

888
00:53:02,732 --> 00:53:04,929
We're gonna find them,
we're gonna get 'em.

889
00:53:05,003 --> 00:53:06,267
I don't know, Jack.

890
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:09,210
I mean, by my calculations...
I'm thinking,

891
00:53:09,279 --> 00:53:11,374
if they're four hours
ahead of us, we can...

892
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:14,787
Shut up! Anybody else wanna
tell me how hard this is gonna be?

893
00:53:14,857 --> 00:53:17,384
Huh? Any other naysayers?

894
00:53:17,462 --> 00:53:21,163
Good. I want you to
break up into two-man teams.

895
00:53:21,236 --> 00:53:23,297
You call me when you find 'em.

896
00:53:54,504 --> 00:53:57,670
Oh, snap.
A softball pitch.

897
00:53:57,744 --> 00:54:00,044
You... I gotta win
something for my girls.

898
00:54:00,115 --> 00:54:02,279
Wait a minute.
You think you're good at this?

899
00:54:02,354 --> 00:54:03,652
Oh, I know I'm good at this.

900
00:54:03,723 --> 00:54:07,094
Hey, on my Little League team,
they used to call me "Bull's Eye Bobby."

901
00:54:07,163 --> 00:54:09,099
- Yeah.
- 'Cause I had pinpoint control.

902
00:54:09,167 --> 00:54:10,157
Right.

903
00:54:10,236 --> 00:54:12,867
A hundred forty-four innings,
never walked a batter.

904
00:54:12,942 --> 00:54:14,433
Watch me work, baby.

905
00:54:14,511 --> 00:54:15,912
- Here you go.
- How you doin'?

906
00:54:15,981 --> 00:54:17,210
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

907
00:54:17,284 --> 00:54:19,516
All right, Bull's Eye Bobby, folks!

908
00:54:21,325 --> 00:54:23,660
Bull's Eye Bobby, baby.

909
00:54:24,632 --> 00:54:27,536
It's probably been, what?
Twenty-eight years, Bulls Eye?

910
00:54:34,252 --> 00:54:36,745
- Hey.
- Hi.

911
00:54:37,758 --> 00:54:39,751
So, um...

912
00:54:41,199 --> 00:54:43,328
- Excuse me?
- Never mind.

913
00:54:43,403 --> 00:54:46,638
- So you like chili?
- Oh, yeah. Not the hot stuff.

914
00:54:46,711 --> 00:54:49,181
But you put a nice,
mild turkey chili in front of me?

915
00:54:49,248 --> 00:54:50,649
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna eat it.

916
00:54:50,719 --> 00:54:53,452
That's too bad 'cause
I wanted you to try mine, but...

917
00:54:53,524 --> 00:54:55,585
...it's pretty hot.
- No, I'll try it!

918
00:54:55,662 --> 00:54:59,500
I like your kinda hot. The...
In your chili. The chili hot. Food hot.

919
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:02,371
That's the kinda hot
I wanna kiss. Eat.

920
00:55:03,845 --> 00:55:05,712
OK. If you're sure
you can handle it.

921
00:55:05,782 --> 00:55:08,481
Handle it? I'm a biker.

922
00:55:08,554 --> 00:55:10,547
- What'd you call him?
- Bull's Eye Bobby!

923
00:55:10,625 --> 00:55:12,026
Bull's Eye Bobby, baby.

924
00:55:12,095 --> 00:55:14,896
- Yeah, Bull's Eye. Yep.
- Ha-ha-ha!

925
00:55:16,370 --> 00:55:18,739
Oh...

926
00:55:20,846 --> 00:55:25,481
- I guess that counts as a walk?
- I'm gonna sit.

927
00:55:42,457 --> 00:55:43,892
Mmm.

928
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:46,453
Smooth. Tasty.

929
00:55:46,531 --> 00:55:49,059
Little... spice.

930
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:51,608
It gets a little hotter
as it sits in your throat.

931
00:55:52,544 --> 00:55:54,810
You OK?

932
00:55:54,882 --> 00:55:56,111
Mm.

933
00:55:56,184 --> 00:55:58,485
You want some of this?
Lt'll cool you down.

934
00:56:03,166 --> 00:56:05,500
Don't worry, your throat
won't actually bleed.

935
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:09,066
I understand.

936
00:56:13,052 --> 00:56:16,583
Mother of God!
I swallowed hot lava!

937
00:56:24,241 --> 00:56:26,040
Hundred and forty-four innings,

938
00:56:26,112 --> 00:56:27,979
you never hit anybody
in the crotch?

939
00:56:28,049 --> 00:56:30,384
Not on purpose, man, all right?
You all right?

940
00:56:30,454 --> 00:56:33,824
- Yeah, it's... Good fastball.
- Hey. I'd like you boys

941
00:56:33,894 --> 00:56:36,161
to meet my deputies,
Earl and Buck Dooble.

942
00:56:36,233 --> 00:56:38,226
- How are you, Earl?
- I'm Earl. He's Buck.

943
00:56:38,304 --> 00:56:40,706
- Earl, Buck.
- Now, just remember:

944
00:56:40,776 --> 00:56:44,078
Brother with the word "ear" in his name
has got both on his head.

945
00:56:45,986 --> 00:56:48,753
See, I can only say that
'cause I'm on his right side,

946
00:56:48,825 --> 00:56:51,159
which, as you can see,
is mostly blown off.

947
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:53,394
- You say something?
- I did not.

948
00:56:53,468 --> 00:56:56,770
Needless to say,
we don't carry firearms anymore.

949
00:56:56,841 --> 00:56:58,970
I mean, sometimes
you pull 'em out,

950
00:56:59,045 --> 00:57:01,608
you think they're not loaded,
and then sometimes...

951
00:57:01,684 --> 00:57:03,449
They blow your
deputy's ear off?

952
00:57:03,521 --> 00:57:05,457
Yeah.

953
00:57:07,897 --> 00:57:09,958
What brings you boys
on this trip, anyway?

954
00:57:10,035 --> 00:57:13,007
Firstly, we had to get away, OK?

955
00:57:13,074 --> 00:57:15,510
And secondly, you know,
you just never know

956
00:57:15,579 --> 00:57:18,107
how many more summers
you've got left.

957
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:21,646
- Do you?
- Wow. That's deep.

958
00:57:21,725 --> 00:57:23,592
I just came on this trip,

959
00:57:23,663 --> 00:57:26,430
you know, hoping to reclaim
the old Doug, you know?

960
00:57:26,502 --> 00:57:29,963
You know, I know
exactly what you mean.

961
00:57:30,042 --> 00:57:34,040
You know, you can never let life
get too stagnant or too safe.

962
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:35,710
Every now and then you gotta do

963
00:57:35,787 --> 00:57:38,919
what we folks around here
like to call "Slap the Bull."

964
00:57:38,994 --> 00:57:40,189
"Slapping the Bull"?

965
00:57:40,263 --> 00:57:42,826
That's just a little game we play

966
00:57:42,902 --> 00:57:45,806
to make sure your life
is not controlled by fear.

967
00:57:45,874 --> 00:57:47,571
Yeah, I wanna do that.

968
00:57:47,645 --> 00:57:49,740
Oh, come on, guys.
We're exhausted.

969
00:57:49,816 --> 00:57:52,515
I think we should just put
the bikes in back of the hotel,

970
00:57:52,588 --> 00:57:56,289
in a shed with the doors closed,
perhaps, and then play Scrabble

971
00:57:56,363 --> 00:57:58,629
in the... in the room
with the shades down.

972
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:02,071
Look, Aunt Bee, maybe you wanna do
something else here in Mayberry.

973
00:58:02,141 --> 00:58:03,131
Yeah.

974
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:06,808
- How 'bout a little Bull Slap?
- Sounds like something I could win at.

975
00:58:06,884 --> 00:58:08,820
- Yeah.
- I'll take a little Bull Slap.

976
00:58:08,888 --> 00:58:11,324
Look, Bull Slap for everybody.
Line 'em up.

977
00:58:11,393 --> 00:58:13,796
- Let's have a little Bull Slap.
- We'll do it!

978
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,232
So literally, we're gonna slap a bull?

979
00:58:17,304 --> 00:58:21,575
Yep. Right on the ass. And then you're
gonna wanna hightail it outta there.

980
00:58:21,647 --> 00:58:23,206
- Why?
- 'Cause he can kill you.

981
00:58:23,283 --> 00:58:24,775
- Mm-hmm.
- Perfect.

982
00:58:24,853 --> 00:58:27,188
Hey, man, I thought
this was a drinking game.

983
00:58:27,259 --> 00:58:29,889
Yeah, you know, you got
a lot of animals I would slap.

984
00:58:29,963 --> 00:58:32,764
A chicken, I'd slap a chicken.
Or a goat, maybe.

985
00:58:32,836 --> 00:58:34,533
A ferret, I'd slap, you know?

986
00:58:34,606 --> 00:58:36,735
But I'm not...
I'm not gonna slap a bull.

987
00:58:36,811 --> 00:58:39,647
Oh, come on, Doug.
It was your idea. Get in there!

988
00:58:39,716 --> 00:58:42,119
I didn't know we...
Look at the nuts on that thing!

989
00:58:42,189 --> 00:58:43,179
Come on!

990
00:58:43,257 --> 00:58:45,420
- It's not safe.
- Not safe. Know what?

991
00:58:45,495 --> 00:58:48,433
- You snooze, you lose. I'm going.
- Getting ready to do that?

992
00:58:48,502 --> 00:58:50,095
- Yep!
- Oh!

993
00:58:50,171 --> 00:58:53,166
You jackass. Go ahead, Woody.
Hope you're wearing a cup.

994
00:58:54,848 --> 00:58:57,445
- Right on the ass.
- He looks confident.

995
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:58,852
Easy.

996
00:59:08,242 --> 00:59:09,608
Whoa!

997
00:59:09,677 --> 00:59:12,809
Come on, get back, now!

998
00:59:14,922 --> 00:59:16,322
Way to get back!

999
00:59:16,391 --> 00:59:18,988
I just slapped
a big fat bull on the ass!

1000
00:59:19,063 --> 00:59:21,329
That was awesome! Who's next?

1001
00:59:21,402 --> 00:59:23,634
- Uh, Doug?
- Doug?

1002
00:59:23,706 --> 00:59:25,699
Yeah, no,
that'd be you, yeah.

1003
00:59:25,777 --> 00:59:27,075
Come on, Doug. Do it!

1004
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:28,740
It's... it... you could...

1005
00:59:28,816 --> 00:59:30,308
That's really an, um...

1006
00:59:30,387 --> 00:59:32,414
Doug, go.

1007
00:59:32,491 --> 00:59:34,586
- Come on, man!
- Handle your business.

1008
00:59:34,662 --> 00:59:36,655
- It was easy.
- I'm not gonna...

1009
00:59:36,732 --> 00:59:38,565
Yeah, come on! It's fun!

1010
00:59:39,471 --> 00:59:41,464
Old days, Doug. Old days.

1011
00:59:41,542 --> 00:59:43,740
All right, all right,
I'm gonna slap a bull.

1012
00:59:43,814 --> 00:59:45,807
- I'm gonna slap that bull.
- There you go.

1013
00:59:45,885 --> 00:59:47,946
- That's my Doug!
- There he goes.

1014
00:59:48,991 --> 00:59:50,927
Just slap it right there
on the rear end?

1015
00:59:50,995 --> 00:59:53,660
Right on the hind haunches.

1016
00:59:55,871 --> 00:59:58,103
You know, this is so good for Doug.

1017
00:59:58,177 --> 01:00:00,204
- Actually, it's good for all of us.
- Yeah.

1018
01:00:00,281 --> 01:00:02,148
Hey, thanks for bringing us here.

1019
01:00:02,218 --> 01:00:03,983
Sure. Glad we could help.

1020
01:00:04,055 --> 01:00:06,753
Yeah, and we never
seen it done twice in a row.

1021
01:00:06,828 --> 01:00:07,989
- Mm-mmm.
- What?

1022
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:10,728
Be interesting to see how
the bull takes being slapped

1023
01:00:10,802 --> 01:00:13,170
- now that he's alert.
- Mm-hmm.

1024
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:14,675
Alert?

1025
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:19,652
Get back!

1026
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,349
- Hurry!
- Hey! Come on.

1027
01:00:24,930 --> 01:00:26,729
Ow!

1028
01:00:28,505 --> 01:00:31,671
He coming back!

1029
01:00:32,913 --> 01:00:33,939
Bull!

1030
01:00:34,016 --> 01:00:37,216
He coming back!
He coming back! Oh...!

1031
01:00:37,289 --> 01:00:40,990
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Ah! He almost got me!

1032
01:00:41,064 --> 01:00:43,432
Come on! What's this bully want?
Come on, bully!

1033
01:00:43,501 --> 01:00:46,497
You don't wanna use mockery!
That never works!

1034
01:00:46,575 --> 01:00:48,009
Cowboy's in trouble!

1035
01:00:49,213 --> 01:00:51,377
Maybe if you just
try to reason with it!

1036
01:00:51,452 --> 01:00:53,854
- He's coming back for more! Look out!
- Whoa!

1037
01:00:53,923 --> 01:00:57,089
He's more afraid of you
than you are of him!

1038
01:00:57,163 --> 01:00:58,597
Watch out!

1039
01:00:58,666 --> 01:01:00,499
Watch out, watch out.
Come on!

1040
01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:02,472
- Come on, let's go, let's go!
- Oh!

1041
01:01:06,916 --> 01:01:08,384
What?!

1042
01:01:08,452 --> 01:01:12,860
- Yeah, man, this is living!
- Yeah, we slapped a bull on the ass!

1043
01:01:12,928 --> 01:01:14,294
- Yes, sir!
- Yeah!

1044
01:01:14,364 --> 01:01:16,266
Yeah, you sure did.

1045
01:01:16,335 --> 01:01:19,570
- You sure did!
- Hey, did y'all see my moves?

1046
01:01:19,642 --> 01:01:22,705
I was shaking and baking
just like the NFL, baby!

1047
01:01:22,782 --> 01:01:24,615
You hear what I'm saying?

1048
01:01:24,685 --> 01:01:27,919
I delivered it
right to the end zo...!

1049
01:01:46,429 --> 01:01:48,992
- Hey, look at him.
- He threw Bobby ten feet in the air.

1050
01:01:49,068 --> 01:01:51,767
Hey, man, that damn bull
kept following me around.

1051
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:55,178
- You think it was my cologne?
- What are you wearing, Rodeo Clown?

1052
01:01:55,248 --> 01:01:56,944
- Hold on...
- So now you got jokes?

1053
01:01:57,017 --> 01:01:59,250
Hey, Woody, you know,

1054
01:01:59,323 --> 01:02:03,058
I apologize for saying you had
ego issues earlier. All right?

1055
01:02:03,130 --> 01:02:04,689
I'm sorry I called you a pussy.

1056
01:02:06,403 --> 01:02:08,669
You didn't call me a pussy.

1057
01:02:08,742 --> 01:02:12,078
No, not to your face,
but that's what I was thinking!

1058
01:02:12,148 --> 01:02:15,382
Hey, we're just saying how much fun
this trip's turned out to be.

1059
01:02:15,455 --> 01:02:18,188
I was so close this time!
So close!

1060
01:02:18,395 --> 01:02:19,829
What's the matter, Dudley?

1061
01:02:20,399 --> 01:02:22,426
The waitress. I think she likes me.

1062
01:02:22,503 --> 01:02:24,496
- Good.
- No, it's not good.

1063
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,567
She told me to meet her
on the dance floor.

1064
01:02:26,645 --> 01:02:28,011
- So?
- So? Go dance.

1065
01:02:28,081 --> 01:02:31,281
I can't go on the dance floor.
You know what I look like.

1066
01:02:31,354 --> 01:02:34,019
The music moves me,
but it moves me ugly.

1067
01:02:34,093 --> 01:02:36,929
Well, do that... sprinkler thing
you did at my wedding.

1068
01:02:36,999 --> 01:02:38,798
- Yeah.
- I can't do the sprinkler.

1069
01:02:38,870 --> 01:02:41,204
I've gotta... I need to...

1070
01:02:43,111 --> 01:02:44,546
- No.
- Yes.

1071
01:02:44,615 --> 01:02:45,913
I said no.

1072
01:02:45,984 --> 01:02:49,047
Why don't we keep it simple,
why don't we just, uh...

1073
01:02:49,123 --> 01:02:52,061
We'll do the lindy.
I'll be the guy, you be the girl.

1074
01:02:52,129 --> 01:02:54,623
There we go.
And it's just... Remember?

1075
01:02:54,702 --> 01:02:56,968
- OK. Yeah, right.
- It's one and two

1076
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:59,442
and three and four,
and turn her around,

1077
01:02:59,511 --> 01:03:01,777
- and start over again.
- Do it two times, and...

1078
01:03:01,849 --> 01:03:03,648
- Whatever you want.
- I'll be the guy.

1079
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:05,782
- Be the guy, I'll be the girl.
- OK. Ready.

1080
01:03:05,858 --> 01:03:08,694
And one and two
and three and four.

1081
01:03:08,764 --> 01:03:12,670
One and two and three and four,
and turn me around and...

1082
01:03:12,739 --> 01:03:15,073
- Oh, yeah! Now we're...
- Oh, OK, that's enough.

1083
01:03:15,143 --> 01:03:17,808
- That's, uh, good lesson.
- What? No, wait. Is that it?

1084
01:03:17,882 --> 01:03:20,445
- Yeah, that's enough.
- That's just a pocket knife.

1085
01:03:22,458 --> 01:03:24,792
There she is.
You're ready. Go.

1086
01:03:24,863 --> 01:03:26,765
- Yeah, let's do it.
- I'm ready.

1087
01:03:26,833 --> 01:03:28,962
You're ready.
Come on. Go.

1088
01:03:56,294 --> 01:03:57,626
Yeah!

1089
01:04:03,708 --> 01:04:05,678
- Whoo!
- Check it out.

1090
01:04:16,033 --> 01:04:18,003
- Oh!
- Ahh!

1091
01:04:18,071 --> 01:04:19,802
Oh! Whoa, whoa.

1092
01:04:23,182 --> 01:04:24,707
He's panicking.

1093
01:04:54,145 --> 01:04:56,672
Hey! That's my phone!

1094
01:04:56,749 --> 01:04:58,776
Your minutes just expired.

1095
01:05:00,257 --> 01:05:03,718
- Baby! Baby, it's Murdock.
- Tell me you found them.

1096
01:05:03,798 --> 01:05:06,360
We did. They're in Madrid.

1097
01:05:06,436 --> 01:05:09,876
Good! Good, good,
good, good. I like Madrid!

1098
01:05:09,943 --> 01:05:11,913
The ground is soft enough
to bury them.

1099
01:05:11,981 --> 01:05:13,951
You want us to
smack 'em around a little?

1100
01:05:14,018 --> 01:05:15,419
<i>No! No! Listen to me!</i>

1101
01:05:15,488 --> 01:05:17,822
You just make sure
they stay there. OK?

1102
01:05:17,892 --> 01:05:19,919
But do not touch them.
They're mine.

1103
01:05:19,997 --> 01:05:22,366
I wanna feel their
bones break under my fists.

1104
01:05:22,435 --> 01:05:24,132
Sounds like
a good beating, Jack.

1105
01:05:24,206 --> 01:05:26,176
We'll leave 'em for you, then.

1106
01:05:27,746 --> 01:05:30,809
Anyone else want some
Wild Hog for breakfast?

1107
01:05:32,289 --> 01:05:35,386
Yee-ha!

1108
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:40,234
You expect me to pay
for this piss-warm beer?

1109
01:05:40,305 --> 01:05:42,742
Here, you can have it back.

1110
01:05:47,319 --> 01:05:49,722
If we drank piss,
we'd drink it cold!

1111
01:05:51,126 --> 01:05:52,288
What?!

1112
01:05:53,565 --> 01:05:55,432
Wait, guys, guys,
guys, guys, look...

1113
01:05:55,502 --> 01:05:57,495
We don't drink piss!

1114
01:05:59,177 --> 01:06:01,147
Hey, hey.

1115
01:06:01,214 --> 01:06:03,548
Hey, Woody.
Maybe it's time to give these guys

1116
01:06:03,618 --> 01:06:05,349
another one of your famous talks.

1117
01:06:05,422 --> 01:06:09,055
I think we just avoid them, OK?
I've handled this legally. We should go.

1118
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:12,193
You know what? I'm talking
to these assholes this time, Woody.

1119
01:06:12,269 --> 01:06:13,898
You shouldn't have to do it twice.

1120
01:06:13,973 --> 01:06:16,672
You took care of them
the last time, and I just sat there.

1121
01:06:16,746 --> 01:06:19,946
But this time, you know what?
They wanna see rage? Watch me.

1122
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:21,885
- Bobby, Bob...
- Whoa!

1123
01:06:22,624 --> 01:06:24,024
Hey, assholes!

1124
01:06:24,094 --> 01:06:27,294
You boys got a hell of a lot of trouble
coming. You know that, right?

1125
01:06:27,367 --> 01:06:28,630
I'm gonna tell you again,

1126
01:06:28,703 --> 01:06:32,234
like my friend told your stupid-ass,
cracker-ass, inbred buddies...

1127
01:06:32,310 --> 01:06:33,779
Did he just say "cracker"?

1128
01:06:33,847 --> 01:06:35,509
- "Cracker-ass."
- Oh, perfect.

1129
01:06:35,583 --> 01:06:38,453
You touch us, and we'll
sue your ass so hard,

1130
01:06:38,523 --> 01:06:40,892
you'll be taking out
a loan just to piss.

1131
01:06:40,961 --> 01:06:45,026
Now, if that ain't clear enough
for you, maybe this is: Splash.

1132
01:06:45,103 --> 01:06:47,096
Huh? Got it?
Did I get it in your mouth?

1133
01:06:47,174 --> 01:06:50,078
Splash! Splash! Splash!
Did I get you on some of that?

1134
01:06:50,146 --> 01:06:51,775
You crossed
a little line there.

1135
01:06:51,850 --> 01:06:54,686
No, no, no, no, no!
It ain't worth it, man.

1136
01:06:54,756 --> 01:06:56,419
Jack'll kill us if we touch him.

1137
01:06:56,493 --> 01:06:58,429
- So just...
- Break some of that up.

1138
01:06:58,497 --> 01:07:00,330
Got a little treat for you.

1139
01:07:00,401 --> 01:07:02,166
Huh? Break a little of that up.

1140
01:07:04,877 --> 01:07:07,074
Can you hear that?
Can you hear that?

1141
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:09,311
Uhh! Uhh!

1142
01:07:09,385 --> 01:07:11,116
Uhhh!

1143
01:07:11,189 --> 01:07:14,161
- That's not a discussion.
- No, that's a lawsuit.

1144
01:07:16,099 --> 01:07:19,869
- Aw, look at that.
- What?!

1145
01:07:22,412 --> 01:07:23,641
That's gonna stain.

1146
01:07:23,715 --> 01:07:27,314
Ha! You boys look like you
belong on a couple of hot dogs.

1147
01:07:27,389 --> 01:07:29,222
Now,

1148
01:07:29,293 --> 01:07:33,826
If there's any other Del Fuegos
that need that message repeated,

1149
01:07:33,903 --> 01:07:35,930
you tell them
that the Wild Hogs...

1150
01:07:39,581 --> 01:07:41,413
...are right here in Madrid, baby...

1151
01:07:41,485 --> 01:07:43,455
...ready to explain it again.

1152
01:07:43,522 --> 01:07:45,788
You got that?

1153
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:47,557
I said you got that?!

1154
01:07:49,367 --> 01:07:51,462
Sweet mother of mercy!

1155
01:07:51,538 --> 01:07:53,371
Huh?!

1156
01:07:54,978 --> 01:07:59,215
He don't want it.
He don't want it. I'm hungry.

1157
01:08:01,291 --> 01:08:02,520
Let's evacuate! Come on!

1158
01:08:07,337 --> 01:08:10,504
- Beer, here!
- Wild Hogs, I gotta tell you,

1159
01:08:10,577 --> 01:08:12,774
you don't know
how many broken windows

1160
01:08:12,848 --> 01:08:14,374
you guys saved this town.

1161
01:08:14,452 --> 01:08:17,891
Sheriff, it's the least we could do
for our new friends here in Madrid.

1162
01:08:17,958 --> 01:08:20,259
- Right, Bobby?
- Wild Hogs!

1163
01:08:20,330 --> 01:08:22,630
Wild Hogs!

1164
01:08:22,701 --> 01:08:24,466
That's some good work
you did there.

1165
01:08:24,538 --> 01:08:25,767
Hey, thank you, sheriff.

1166
01:08:25,841 --> 01:08:29,212
Now look, you know, if you need
something done, just come to me.

1167
01:08:29,281 --> 01:08:31,844
You know what I mean?
'Cause I will beat shit down.

1168
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,947
Let's say them peanuts
are bothering you.

1169
01:08:34,025 --> 01:08:36,359
Huh? I don't wanna hear it!
I don't wanna hear it!

1170
01:08:36,429 --> 01:08:39,401
What'd the sheriff tell you?
What'd the town people tell you?

1171
01:08:39,468 --> 01:08:41,939
What the...?
You know what I mean?

1172
01:08:42,007 --> 01:08:45,412
I ain't got no problem with it.
I ain't got no problem with it.

1173
01:08:45,481 --> 01:08:48,681
Yeah. Yeah.
That's all right.

1174
01:08:48,754 --> 01:08:52,056
This is great. Right, Woody?

1175
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:55,123
- Huh?
- You all right?

1176
01:08:57,940 --> 01:08:58,930
Yeah...

1177
01:09:00,411 --> 01:09:01,880
- I'm gonna call Kelly.
- Yeah.

1178
01:09:01,948 --> 01:09:04,214
Remind her just what
kind of a stud she married.

1179
01:09:04,286 --> 01:09:07,156
All right,
yeah, you do that.

1180
01:09:10,499 --> 01:09:11,967
Hey, hey, Bobby!

1181
01:09:12,035 --> 01:09:14,198
Next time, I handle
those bozos, eh?

1182
01:09:14,272 --> 01:09:17,039
The wrath of Dudley!
Wild Hogs!

1183
01:09:17,112 --> 01:09:19,242
Wild Hogs!

1184
01:09:19,317 --> 01:09:21,753
Tequila, on the Wild Hogs.

1185
01:09:25,262 --> 01:09:27,630
In New Mexico.
We actually slapped a bull.

1186
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:29,567
Slapped it right on the ass.

1187
01:09:29,637 --> 01:09:31,767
You have no idea
how turned on I am right now,

1188
01:09:31,842 --> 01:09:34,312
- but please be careful.
- We're like celebrities.

1189
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:36,647
- Well, Bobby is.
- Man, I crush them cashews.

1190
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:38,746
- Macadamia nuts?
- Oh, macadamia nut?

1191
01:09:38,823 --> 01:09:40,052
I'd kick it out the park.

1192
01:09:40,125 --> 01:09:42,790
Hey! And guess who
dropped by to say hello.

1193
01:09:42,864 --> 01:09:45,358
Karen. Yeah, I think
she's feeling a little lonely.

1194
01:09:45,436 --> 01:09:47,029
- Who's that?
- It's Doug.

1195
01:09:47,106 --> 01:09:49,270
Says they're having
a great time on the trip.

1196
01:09:49,344 --> 01:09:51,109
Kelly, don't tell her
about the...

1197
01:09:51,182 --> 01:09:52,673
Road trip?!

1198
01:09:55,323 --> 01:09:57,589
Hey! Dudley,
don't you wanna come inside?

1199
01:09:57,661 --> 01:09:59,825
I'm fine. I'm just gonna, um,

1200
01:09:59,899 --> 01:10:02,597
sit out here
for a little while, I think.

1201
01:10:02,671 --> 01:10:04,699
OK. You OK?

1202
01:10:05,510 --> 01:10:08,243
I'm fine. I'm... uh...

1203
01:10:11,823 --> 01:10:13,314
No, the truth is I'm not OK.

1204
01:10:13,393 --> 01:10:15,659
The truth is I like you a lot, Maggie.

1205
01:10:18,337 --> 01:10:20,899
I'm liking you a lot too.

1206
01:10:20,975 --> 01:10:24,073
See, that's what I was afraid of.

1207
01:10:25,117 --> 01:10:27,644
That you would like me
without knowing...

1208
01:10:27,722 --> 01:10:29,955
Without me telling you...

1209
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:35,395
I'm not a cool biker, Maggie.

1210
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:38,642
I'm not a cool anything.

1211
01:10:38,711 --> 01:10:40,442
I'm a computer programmer.

1212
01:10:40,515 --> 01:10:42,678
I'm just a geek.

1213
01:10:43,588 --> 01:10:47,255
I'm sorry if you thought
I was somebody that I'm not.

1214
01:10:54,410 --> 01:10:57,610
Mm-mm. You're not a geek.

1215
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:03,725
- You're a lot of fun.
- Hmm.

1216
01:11:06,635 --> 01:11:09,367
And you're really honest.

1217
01:11:12,513 --> 01:11:14,710
And you're really sweet.

1218
01:11:18,492 --> 01:11:21,225
You're the kind of guy
that's hard to find.

1219
01:11:29,147 --> 01:11:31,447
Sorry.

1220
01:11:31,518 --> 01:11:33,648
Try again. One more time.

1221
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:41,134
All right, Bobby!
All gassed up!

1222
01:11:42,641 --> 01:11:46,411
- Whoo! All gassed up, baby!
- All right. Let's get Dudley. Let's go!

1223
01:11:46,482 --> 01:11:48,110
- Clive, what's up?
- Hey! My man!

1224
01:11:48,186 --> 01:11:50,383
What you know? No good?
All right. OK.

1225
01:11:50,457 --> 01:11:53,486
We're going to high altitudes.
We should check tire pressure.

1226
01:11:53,563 --> 01:11:55,226
Whoa, no, no, little buddy.

1227
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:57,236
We gotta ride.
We gotta get going, OK?

1228
01:11:57,304 --> 01:11:59,706
We got new experiences
and new locations, right?

1229
01:11:59,776 --> 01:12:02,714
We can't leave, man.
I'm like the mayor of this town.

1230
01:12:02,782 --> 01:12:05,412
- My people need me.
- I said we're leaving!

1231
01:12:06,522 --> 01:12:07,752
Hey, guys.

1232
01:12:07,826 --> 01:12:09,853
We decided we wanna
have breakfast here.

1233
01:12:09,930 --> 01:12:12,127
Come on! Hey, cowboy!
Let's saddle up, OK?

1234
01:12:12,201 --> 01:12:14,434
You're burning daylight. Let's go!

1235
01:12:14,506 --> 01:12:16,499
Got a problem with
hanging a few minutes?

1236
01:12:16,577 --> 01:12:18,274
Do I look like
I have a problem? Do I?

1237
01:12:18,347 --> 01:12:19,713
- Yeah.
- Yes.

1238
01:12:19,783 --> 01:12:22,186
There you go again.
Saying the weirdest shit.

1239
01:12:33,477 --> 01:12:35,710
Del Fuegos!
Hide the bikes! Quick!

1240
01:12:35,782 --> 01:12:38,014
- Why, why?
- Just do it! Trust me!

1241
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:41,857
What's wrong?
Why are we hiding?

1242
01:12:41,928 --> 01:12:44,593
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

1243
01:12:55,455 --> 01:12:57,652
- Oh, God!
- Hey! Why are we hiding?

1244
01:12:57,726 --> 01:12:59,856
You took care of this
already, didn't you?

1245
01:12:59,932 --> 01:13:01,525
No, not like you think, OK?

1246
01:13:01,601 --> 01:13:04,072
Well, what is it that I think?

1247
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:06,303
I didn't really talk to them, OK?

1248
01:13:06,377 --> 01:13:08,848
- You serious?
- I knew something was wrong.

1249
01:13:08,916 --> 01:13:10,909
Dudley, you're like,
"I'm all stupid...

1250
01:13:10,987 --> 01:13:12,012
Not Dudley's fault!

1251
01:13:12,089 --> 01:13:14,583
...take my bike, give me
a piece of junk, I'm happy."

1252
01:13:14,661 --> 01:13:16,654
You're all,
"I'm scared. Let's get out."

1253
01:13:16,732 --> 01:13:18,133
- Whatever.
- It's our fault?

1254
01:13:18,202 --> 01:13:20,195
The Del Fuegos are all,
"You're nothing.

1255
01:13:20,273 --> 01:13:22,368
- We're real bikers."
- This isn't about us!

1256
01:13:22,444 --> 01:13:24,437
- What did you do?
- What did you do, Woody?

1257
01:13:25,483 --> 01:13:28,080
I...

1258
01:13:28,957 --> 01:13:31,793
I cut the gas lines
of their bikes.

1259
01:13:32,530 --> 01:13:33,829
And then I...

1260
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:36,929
- What?
- Maybe blew up their bar.

1261
01:13:37,007 --> 01:13:38,772
- Oh!
- Ah, perfect!

1262
01:13:38,844 --> 01:13:41,748
- Oh, we're dead!
- Oh, come on!

1263
01:13:41,816 --> 01:13:44,116
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

1264
01:13:44,187 --> 01:13:46,624
That means they're
just here to kill us.

1265
01:13:52,338 --> 01:13:54,570
No sign of 'em, Jack.

1266
01:13:58,150 --> 01:14:00,177
Wild Hogs!

1267
01:14:00,254 --> 01:14:03,317
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

1268
01:14:03,393 --> 01:14:05,864
I finally meet a girl,
and now I'm gonna die.

1269
01:14:05,932 --> 01:14:08,129
So all the mustard
and the ketchup...

1270
01:14:08,203 --> 01:14:10,139
...didn't help the situation, huh?

1271
01:14:10,207 --> 01:14:12,006
Ohhh!

1272
01:14:12,078 --> 01:14:15,745
Oh, you don't
wanna come out? We'll wait!

1273
01:14:16,821 --> 01:14:19,156
There's only one road
out of this town!

1274
01:14:19,226 --> 01:14:21,162
We own it!

1275
01:14:21,230 --> 01:14:25,000
Me and my boys will be
in this lovely little diner here!

1276
01:14:25,071 --> 01:14:29,740
Get out of here!
The longer you keep us waiting,

1277
01:14:29,814 --> 01:14:34,187
the worse it's gonna get for
the peaceful town of Madrid!

1278
01:14:38,131 --> 01:14:41,935
Jack! I'm going
to ask you not to.

1279
01:14:42,005 --> 01:14:43,838
What did you say,
you little turd?

1280
01:14:43,909 --> 01:14:45,902
- What did he say?
- He called him a turd.

1281
01:14:47,984 --> 01:14:49,920
Let's go!

1282
01:14:49,988 --> 01:14:52,221
Enjoy.

1283
01:14:52,293 --> 01:14:53,818
OK, I made a mistake.

1284
01:14:53,897 --> 01:14:56,926
Woody, we could have just
went home, man, and been fine.

1285
01:14:57,003 --> 01:14:59,530
Yeah, well, you know,
maybe I don't have a home.

1286
01:14:59,607 --> 01:15:01,543
Claudia left me.

1287
01:15:01,611 --> 01:15:03,809
Three months ago she left.

1288
01:15:03,883 --> 01:15:06,410
And then I fell apart.
Lost my clients.

1289
01:15:06,489 --> 01:15:08,425
And then I lost my job.

1290
01:15:08,493 --> 01:15:11,157
Now I got to sell the house
and I got to sell the car.

1291
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:13,566
Can't even get
the lawn raked, you know.

1292
01:15:13,636 --> 01:15:16,233
I just got the bike and I got
you guys. That's all I got.

1293
01:15:16,309 --> 01:15:19,007
So this trip is
all about you running away

1294
01:15:19,081 --> 01:15:22,110
from your miserable, screwed-up life?

1295
01:15:22,187 --> 01:15:24,852
And you screw up our lives?

1296
01:15:24,926 --> 01:15:26,258
Asshole!

1297
01:15:26,329 --> 01:15:30,565
I'm sorry about your situation,
Woody, but you're a lying asshole.

1298
01:15:30,637 --> 01:15:33,667
- Which is like an asshole's asshole.
- I thought that...

1299
01:15:33,744 --> 01:15:37,410
I thought that being a Wild Hog
meant something. But clearly it doesn't.

1300
01:15:37,485 --> 01:15:40,012
You don't care about me!
That's fine. I don't care.

1301
01:15:40,090 --> 01:15:42,151
It doesn't mean anything, Woody!

1302
01:15:42,227 --> 01:15:44,289
Remember, it's just
a patch my wife made!

1303
01:15:44,366 --> 01:15:46,461
We should go somewhere
to yell at each other

1304
01:15:46,537 --> 01:15:48,700
where there aren't people
trying to kill us.

1305
01:15:54,119 --> 01:15:55,610
Hey, Maggie.

1306
01:15:57,525 --> 01:15:59,586
Thanks for letting us
hide in your house.

1307
01:15:59,663 --> 01:16:00,791
Yeah, thanks.

1308
01:16:00,866 --> 01:16:04,134
It's hard not to when you're
screaming and kicking down the door.

1309
01:16:04,205 --> 01:16:05,697
Hey.

1310
01:16:05,776 --> 01:16:07,244
You OK?

1311
01:16:07,312 --> 01:16:10,045
Mm. Yeah.
Diner's the only thing I have.

1312
01:16:10,117 --> 01:16:12,645
If that gets destroyed, it's...

1313
01:16:12,723 --> 01:16:16,720
But you're safe.
You guys are safe.

1314
01:16:16,798 --> 01:16:18,427
Now just stay put.

1315
01:16:18,501 --> 01:16:20,767
Nobody has to go out
there and be a hero.

1316
01:16:20,839 --> 01:16:22,433
You got that right.

1317
01:16:22,509 --> 01:16:26,074
- You guys aren't going out there?
- You're the sheriff. Why don't you go?

1318
01:16:26,150 --> 01:16:29,554
Like, sheriff
of a town of 500 people.

1319
01:16:29,624 --> 01:16:32,620
I got my qualification
from a course on the Internet.

1320
01:16:32,697 --> 01:16:35,293
<i>For arms training,
they just told us to play Doom.</i>

1321
01:16:35,369 --> 01:16:37,305
I say we just wait it out,

1322
01:16:37,373 --> 01:16:39,469
they'll lose interest,
and they'll go.

1323
01:16:39,544 --> 01:16:41,707
Yeah, I agree.
Wait it out.

1324
01:16:43,051 --> 01:16:46,191
Hey. Where's Dudley?

1325
01:16:53,506 --> 01:16:55,476
Oh, Dudley. Don't do that.

1326
01:17:00,319 --> 01:17:02,016
All right, you Del Fuegos...

1327
01:17:08,970 --> 01:17:09,960
Hey!

1328
01:17:13,513 --> 01:17:14,913
Let's end this.

1329
01:17:14,982 --> 01:17:17,977
At least one of you
came out to face the music.

1330
01:17:18,056 --> 01:17:19,888
Very brave.

1331
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:21,223
But stupid.

1332
01:17:21,296 --> 01:17:23,630
I didn't come to face any music.

1333
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:26,832
I came here to stop you fellas
from hurting this diner,

1334
01:17:26,907 --> 01:17:30,038
which the love of my life
just happens to own.

1335
01:17:31,082 --> 01:17:35,615
So, if it's gotta get ugly...
I'll give you ugly.

1336
01:17:43,274 --> 01:17:45,335
It slipped out of my glove.

1337
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:48,508
Hey! Is it OK if I
tell people you guys did that?

1338
01:17:48,584 --> 01:17:50,349
I should be getting back.
It's late.

1339
01:17:50,421 --> 01:17:53,359
The guys are gonna be worrying.
We'll talk later.

1340
01:17:54,530 --> 01:17:56,432
Guys! Guys!

1341
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:58,903
No, no. You don't get to
hide out here with us.

1342
01:17:58,972 --> 01:18:02,467
You get to hide outside with those
crazy people that wanna kill us.

1343
01:18:02,547 --> 01:18:05,382
- They got Dudley. Look out the window.
- What?

1344
01:18:05,452 --> 01:18:08,583
All right, this is
what's gonna happen, Wild Hogs!

1345
01:18:08,659 --> 01:18:13,066
You're gonna pay
a disobedience fee of $10,000!

1346
01:18:13,134 --> 01:18:16,596
Plus another $40,000
to rebuild the bar!

1347
01:18:16,675 --> 01:18:19,272
And if you wanna
see your friend alive again,

1348
01:18:19,347 --> 01:18:21,340
do not call the cops!

1349
01:18:21,418 --> 01:18:24,117
If you're not here
in a half an hour to settle this,

1350
01:18:24,190 --> 01:18:27,287
I'm gonna take the fine out
on your friend's legs!

1351
01:18:27,363 --> 01:18:29,994
I'm gonna break 'em
with this tire iron!

1352
01:18:30,069 --> 01:18:32,198
Don't bring the money!

1353
01:18:32,273 --> 01:18:35,735
I'm a computer programmer!
I don't need my legs!

1354
01:18:35,814 --> 01:18:39,082
Fine! I'll break his hands!

1355
01:18:39,153 --> 01:18:40,679
- Yeah!
- Oh, damn it.

1356
01:18:40,757 --> 01:18:42,192
Bring the money!

1357
01:18:42,261 --> 01:18:44,925
Definitely!
Definitely bring money!

1358
01:18:44,999 --> 01:18:48,268
- Get him out of here!
- Now! We need money!

1359
01:18:50,744 --> 01:18:53,945
Dudley went to save the diner,
now they're gonna break his hands.

1360
01:18:54,018 --> 01:18:56,956
No, they're not. We're gonna...
We're gonna get him back.

1361
01:18:57,024 --> 01:19:00,019
I've called the highway patrol.
Gonna be here in two hours.

1362
01:19:00,096 --> 01:19:04,127
Hey, man. They said no cops, or else
they gonna take it out on Dudley.

1363
01:19:04,204 --> 01:19:07,199
We don't wanna piss 'em off
until we get him out of their hands.

1364
01:19:07,277 --> 01:19:09,714
You know, he's not exactly
in their hands now, OK?

1365
01:19:09,783 --> 01:19:11,446
Why not?
He was sitting right...

1366
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:14,856
- What the...?
- Get me down!

1367
01:19:15,127 --> 01:19:18,224
Why? You look good up there!

1368
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:20,566
You look like
a piata with red hair!

1369
01:19:21,707 --> 01:19:25,238
I think... I think I'm gonna keep you
up there till your buddies come!

1370
01:19:25,314 --> 01:19:27,808
And then if they don't,
I'm gonna bust you open

1371
01:19:27,886 --> 01:19:30,790
and we're gonna see
what falls out! Ha!

1372
01:19:31,928 --> 01:19:34,330
Bobby! Woody! Doug!

1373
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:36,393
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

1374
01:19:36,471 --> 01:19:39,033
Well, I know what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna go get him.

1375
01:19:39,109 --> 01:19:41,512
There you go
talking crazy again.

1376
01:19:41,581 --> 01:19:44,280
- They will kill you.
- No, I'm not talking crazy.

1377
01:19:44,353 --> 01:19:47,553
I have three people left
in my life that I care about,

1378
01:19:47,626 --> 01:19:49,755
and I let you guys down.

1379
01:19:49,830 --> 01:19:52,233
Nah. I'd rather go out there
and make it go right

1380
01:19:52,302 --> 01:19:55,764
and die doing it than be the asshole
that screwed everything up.

1381
01:19:55,843 --> 01:19:58,075
Hey, hey, Woody.
Woody, where you going?

1382
01:20:05,062 --> 01:20:06,291
Woody!

1383
01:20:08,234 --> 01:20:10,364
Don't you know hogs
run in packs, baby?

1384
01:20:13,712 --> 01:20:15,409
We're still Wild Hogs?

1385
01:20:15,483 --> 01:20:18,284
- Wild Hogs, man.
- Wild Hogs.

1386
01:20:18,355 --> 01:20:21,691
All right, here's how it's gotta go.
I gotta get up to 30 miles an hour.

1387
01:20:21,762 --> 01:20:25,361
It's only duct tape holding that rope.
I'll get him by the trunk and grab him

1388
01:20:25,436 --> 01:20:28,431
- and I'll save Dudley.
- You'll need a distraction.

1389
01:20:28,509 --> 01:20:32,142
Together, guys. Together we can do this.
And I'm ready. I'm ready.

1390
01:20:32,217 --> 01:20:33,618
I'm ready.

1391
01:20:33,687 --> 01:20:35,953
- What?
- What's wrong?

1392
01:20:36,024 --> 01:20:38,153
- It's gonna sound kind of stupid.
- What?

1393
01:20:38,229 --> 01:20:40,860
Well, before I go,
I need one of you to yell,

1394
01:20:40,934 --> 01:20:43,770
"It's the Golden Knight!"
It helps me get in the mood.

1395
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:45,605
Yeah, baby!

1396
01:20:45,677 --> 01:20:47,670
- It helps motivate me.
- He's back!

1397
01:20:49,118 --> 01:20:51,680
It's the Golden Knight.

1398
01:20:51,756 --> 01:20:53,750
With gusto, though.

1399
01:21:01,744 --> 01:21:04,044
- Now?
- Now!

1400
01:21:04,115 --> 01:21:06,586
Holy crap,
it's the Golden Knight!

1401
01:21:15,705 --> 01:21:18,336
Clear 'em out, boys!
Clear 'em out!

1402
01:21:18,411 --> 01:21:21,383
Del Fuego!
Come out and play, baby!

1403
01:21:21,450 --> 01:21:24,081
All day, baby! All day!

1404
01:21:24,156 --> 01:21:26,422
Thirty-five, 35, exactly 35!

1405
01:21:28,899 --> 01:21:31,735
Wild Hogs, baby! Wild Hogs!

1406
01:21:33,575 --> 01:21:35,602
OK, guys, slow down...
You're gonna...

1407
01:21:37,182 --> 01:21:38,947
Oh, no, no, no...
Ooh... Whoa!

1408
01:21:39,019 --> 01:21:42,390
Du-Dud-Dudley!

1409
01:21:42,460 --> 01:21:45,830
- Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho...
- All right, I gotcha. I gotcha.

1410
01:21:46,868 --> 01:21:50,239
- You having fun?
- That was amazing!

1411
01:21:50,309 --> 01:21:52,506
The tape was supposed to break!

1412
01:21:52,580 --> 01:21:53,570
Oh...

1413
01:21:55,754 --> 01:21:57,656
- Oh...
- There it goes.

1414
01:21:57,724 --> 01:21:59,193
- Is there a problem?
- Come on. Come on!

1415
01:21:59,193 --> 01:22:00,560
- Is there a problem?
- Come on. Come on!

1416
01:22:00,630 --> 01:22:02,793
You burned down Damien's bar,

1417
01:22:02,868 --> 01:22:05,134
you pull this little
circus act out here,

1418
01:22:05,205 --> 01:22:08,474
now you're gonna see what
it's like when you mess with us.

1419
01:22:08,546 --> 01:22:10,675
- That's right.
- Burn down the diner!

1420
01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:12,617
- Torch it!
- Whoa, whoa, look, look...

1421
01:22:12,688 --> 01:22:14,317
We can come up
with the money,

1422
01:22:14,391 --> 01:22:15,916
I got a little bit
in my savings.

1423
01:22:15,995 --> 01:22:18,899
It was my fault. I did it.
I cut the fuel lines.

1424
01:22:18,967 --> 01:22:21,267
Let me deal with it.
Let these guys go.

1425
01:22:21,339 --> 01:22:24,675
No! We're not gonna pay any money
and we're not calling the cops.

1426
01:22:26,215 --> 01:22:28,117
We're gonna stand here and fight.

1427
01:22:31,092 --> 01:22:32,561
You don't want our money.

1428
01:22:32,628 --> 01:22:34,564
What do you need money for?
You're free.

1429
01:22:34,632 --> 01:22:38,299
You're just here to get what you get
from the townspeople all the time, fear.

1430
01:22:38,374 --> 01:22:41,505
'Cause you're scary people.
People'll do anything to stay safe,

1431
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:44,609
including give up the biggest
part of their lives, adventure.

1432
01:22:44,686 --> 01:22:48,148
Let's have a little adventure, huh?
Let's fight. Let's dance, huh?

1433
01:22:48,227 --> 01:22:50,322
- Let's do it!
- Enough's enough.

1434
01:22:50,398 --> 01:22:53,461
- Let's kick some Del Taco ass.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1435
01:22:53,537 --> 01:22:55,804
Do either of you guys
have a knife or scissors?

1436
01:22:55,876 --> 01:22:57,037
A nail clipper?

1437
01:22:57,111 --> 01:22:59,047
All right,
so how do we do this?

1438
01:22:59,115 --> 01:23:01,108
Like high school?
A little circle, huh?

1439
01:23:01,186 --> 01:23:02,678
- Oh!
- Yeah!

1440
01:23:02,756 --> 01:23:05,353
Murdock, Red, Tiny.
Four on four.

1441
01:23:06,964 --> 01:23:09,367
- Body or face, pretty boy?
- Not the face.

1442
01:23:09,837 --> 01:23:12,468
Ow!

1443
01:23:23,665 --> 01:23:26,136
- I'll take him.
- Thank you!

1444
01:23:27,339 --> 01:23:29,468
Yah!

1445
01:23:37,293 --> 01:23:39,627
- Trade back! Trade back.
- I got him, I got him.

1446
01:23:39,698 --> 01:23:42,169
It's not really fair,
you know. I'm kinda tied up.

1447
01:23:45,109 --> 01:23:48,275
You ever see a hook off the jab?
Huh? Bring it!

1448
01:23:55,463 --> 01:23:57,798
- Oh!
- Let's have a little fun, baby.

1449
01:23:57,868 --> 01:23:58,893
Whew. Let's play.

1450
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:01,340
Golden Glove, baby.

1451
01:24:06,084 --> 01:24:08,145
Ow! Ow! You hit my helmet.

1452
01:24:08,223 --> 01:24:10,055
Are you OK, man?
You hurt your hand?

1453
01:24:10,127 --> 01:24:11,595
That actually really hurt.

1454
01:24:11,663 --> 01:24:13,530
Whoa!

1455
01:24:17,141 --> 01:24:19,270
Good shot! Get off!

1456
01:24:19,345 --> 01:24:20,608
Oh!

1457
01:24:20,681 --> 01:24:23,050
Uh-oh, no, no, no, no, don't...

1458
01:24:24,155 --> 01:24:25,316
- Throw sand!
- What?

1459
01:24:25,390 --> 01:24:27,223
- Throw sand!
- Yeah...

1460
01:24:28,664 --> 01:24:30,394
I didn't mean to aim there...

1461
01:24:32,171 --> 01:24:34,107
Ha! Whoo! Nice...

1462
01:24:40,922 --> 01:24:43,758
Damn!
I done knocked out my boy!

1463
01:24:43,828 --> 01:24:47,563
- Come on. You all right?
- Ooh...

1464
01:24:54,851 --> 01:24:56,547
Well, that was easy.

1465
01:24:59,292 --> 01:25:01,387
- Come on.
- Burn down the diner!

1466
01:25:01,464 --> 01:25:04,959
- Yeah!
- Come on!

1467
01:25:05,038 --> 01:25:08,101
- Oh, good. You want some more?
- Yeah, I got nothing to lose.

1468
01:25:08,178 --> 01:25:11,309
I got no wife.
No job. No house.

1469
01:25:11,384 --> 01:25:14,788
I got my friends, though.
I got them till the end.

1470
01:25:15,559 --> 01:25:17,756
- Oh!
- That's great!

1471
01:25:17,830 --> 01:25:20,803
You know, you know
what's so stupid about this?

1472
01:25:20,870 --> 01:25:25,334
We wanted to be like you guys. What I
see here is just a bunch of grown men

1473
01:25:25,412 --> 01:25:29,683
whose biggest decision in life is,
"Uh, sleeveless or, uh... sleeveless?

1474
01:25:29,755 --> 01:25:32,488
Do I shit behind the rock,
or over there by that bush?"

1475
01:25:33,095 --> 01:25:35,224
Grown men.
This is pathetic.

1476
01:25:35,300 --> 01:25:36,893
You go ahead
and kick our ass, OK?

1477
01:25:36,969 --> 01:25:39,600
Because we're not the posers.
You guys are the posers.

1478
01:25:40,243 --> 01:25:42,577
Ow!

1479
01:25:42,647 --> 01:25:46,587
Hey! Do yourselves a favor
and stay down!

1480
01:25:46,655 --> 01:25:49,422
Twenty-five years
of being yelled at.

1481
01:25:49,495 --> 01:25:51,055
Man, I ain't taking this...

1482
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:57,744
And I got a girlfriend.
Punch that out of me, bitches.

1483
01:25:58,947 --> 01:26:00,507
Hmm?

1484
01:26:05,995 --> 01:26:07,760
- Oh.
- Are we doing this?

1485
01:26:11,873 --> 01:26:13,638
- Let's do it.
- Yeah.

1486
01:26:13,710 --> 01:26:15,771
Come on.

1487
01:26:20,424 --> 01:26:23,487
- Come on.
- Come on.

1488
01:26:31,313 --> 01:26:32,680
You're kidding me, right?

1489
01:26:37,158 --> 01:26:38,684
What's wrong with you guys?

1490
01:26:40,599 --> 01:26:42,865
All right!
You wanna keep going?

1491
01:26:42,936 --> 01:26:45,464
I don't think so.

1492
01:26:45,542 --> 01:26:50,416
You're done, Jack.
You Del Fuegos! You are done!

1493
01:26:50,485 --> 01:26:52,752
And we want you
out of our town, now.

1494
01:26:52,824 --> 01:26:55,488
- And who's "we"?
- All of us.

1495
01:26:59,303 --> 01:27:02,275
If four people could
stand up to a gang of bikers,

1496
01:27:02,343 --> 01:27:04,209
I guess we can too!

1497
01:27:04,281 --> 01:27:07,047
Well, we'll fight you and
the Children of the Corn too.

1498
01:27:07,119 --> 01:27:11,618
'Cause the Del Fuegos don't
back down! This is our highway.

1499
01:27:11,695 --> 01:27:14,292
And we're gonna
defend our highway.

1500
01:27:14,367 --> 01:27:16,166
Wrong, Jack.

1501
01:27:17,875 --> 01:27:20,368
It's my highway.

1502
01:27:20,446 --> 01:27:21,745
Blade.

1503
01:27:22,751 --> 01:27:24,687
Hi, Maggie.

1504
01:27:26,491 --> 01:27:30,626
- Hmm. Bar burned down.
- Yeah.

1505
01:27:30,701 --> 01:27:33,571
These posers, these
four posers right here.

1506
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:37,580
Four guys
stand off 50 bikers...

1507
01:27:38,984 --> 01:27:41,148
...and they're the posers?
- Yeah.

1508
01:27:41,222 --> 01:27:43,158
They burnt down
the bar that you built.

1509
01:27:43,226 --> 01:27:44,524
It was a shithole.

1510
01:27:44,595 --> 01:27:47,066
I insured it for
twice what it was worth.

1511
01:27:47,134 --> 01:27:48,625
The guys did me a favor.

1512
01:27:48,703 --> 01:27:51,470
We were just following
the code that you wrote.

1513
01:27:51,542 --> 01:27:53,843
Why do you think
I don't wear the colors, Jack?

1514
01:27:53,914 --> 01:27:55,543
Why do you think I ride alone?

1515
01:27:55,618 --> 01:27:57,679
'Cause you don't
know about it anymore.

1516
01:27:57,756 --> 01:28:01,491
I think you all oughta get back on your
bikes and go out and ride the highway

1517
01:28:01,563 --> 01:28:03,829
until you remember
what riding's all about.

1518
01:28:05,003 --> 01:28:06,734
Let it go, Jack.

1519
01:28:19,566 --> 01:28:21,058
OK, Pop.

1520
01:28:22,907 --> 01:28:25,036
Takes after his mom.

1521
01:28:35,432 --> 01:28:37,800
Man, that was like
level 12 of Doom.

1522
01:28:39,607 --> 01:28:41,270
The posers.

1523
01:28:41,344 --> 01:28:43,678
- What do you guys call yourselves?
- I'm Woody.

1524
01:28:43,748 --> 01:28:44,876
- I'm Bobby.
- I'm Doug.

1525
01:28:44,952 --> 01:28:46,888
No, no, no. You all riding together?

1526
01:28:46,956 --> 01:28:49,256
- What do you...
- Hogs! Wild Hogs.

1527
01:28:49,327 --> 01:28:51,354
Wild...
Yeah, Wild Hogs.

1528
01:28:52,601 --> 01:28:56,507
Well, Wild Hogs,
ride hard or stay home.

1529
01:28:56,575 --> 01:29:00,345
- Yeah.
- Oh, and, guys, lose the watches.

1530
01:29:03,523 --> 01:29:05,186
- Freedom, baby.
- We did it, babe.

1531
01:29:05,260 --> 01:29:08,357
All day. All day.

1532
01:29:08,432 --> 01:29:11,927
Hey! Hey! We're Wild Hogs!
The saga continues!

1533
01:29:27,404 --> 01:29:28,668
What the hell?

1534
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:31,769
What in the world
is going on around here?

1535
01:29:32,949 --> 01:29:35,146
Plumbing conference?

1536
01:29:35,221 --> 01:29:36,621
Have you lost your mind?

1537
01:29:36,690 --> 01:29:38,091
Shut up, Doug!

1538
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:40,892
Bobby, who are these people,
and where are we at?

1539
01:29:40,966 --> 01:29:45,100
Well, obviously, I'm not at a...
plumbing conference in Cleveland, baby.

1540
01:29:45,174 --> 01:29:46,199
Oh, really?

1541
01:29:46,276 --> 01:29:48,303
Baby, I've been
fighting bikers all day,

1542
01:29:48,380 --> 01:29:50,543
this little Chinese
dude bust my nose,

1543
01:29:50,618 --> 01:29:52,417
I've been slapping bulls...

1544
01:29:52,488 --> 01:29:55,950
Bobby, I don't give a damn
about you fighting no bulls!

1545
01:29:56,029 --> 01:29:58,432
Now, I want you to get
your ass in that van

1546
01:29:58,501 --> 01:29:59,867
because we are going home.

1547
01:29:59,937 --> 01:30:02,100
I cannot believe you'd
deceive me like this!

1548
01:30:02,174 --> 01:30:03,803
- Karen...
- No, Bobby, I want...!

1549
01:30:03,878 --> 01:30:05,279
Karen!

1550
01:30:06,150 --> 01:30:07,948
Slow your roll.

1551
01:30:08,020 --> 01:30:11,118
Look, baby, I love you, OK?

1552
01:30:11,193 --> 01:30:13,254
But I'm tired of being talked at.

1553
01:30:13,331 --> 01:30:15,733
I don't talk at you, Bobby!

1554
01:30:15,803 --> 01:30:18,000
- I talk...
- Look at what you're doing now.

1555
01:30:18,074 --> 01:30:20,237
Come on. You feel me?

1556
01:30:20,312 --> 01:30:22,806
OK, baby, all right,
all right, I feel you.

1557
01:30:22,884 --> 01:30:25,081
Right now I just need
you to show me some love.

1558
01:30:25,155 --> 01:30:27,091
Just a little bit of love.

1559
01:30:27,794 --> 01:30:31,290
Oh... Mmm...

1560
01:30:31,368 --> 01:30:35,000
That's scrumptious.

1561
01:30:35,075 --> 01:30:37,069
You seriously got
in a fight with bikers?

1562
01:30:37,146 --> 01:30:39,480
A whole bunch of 'em.
We chased 'em out of town!

1563
01:30:39,551 --> 01:30:40,849
There was 50 of them.

1564
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:42,287
- It was something.
- Fifty?

1565
01:30:42,357 --> 01:30:44,759
I gotta tell the guys
about this. That is awesome!

1566
01:30:44,829 --> 01:30:46,457
I'll be right back, OK?

1567
01:30:46,531 --> 01:30:48,194
Doug, are you sure you're OK?

1568
01:30:49,571 --> 01:30:51,735
- Ow, ow, ow, ow...
- Oh, your ribs, your ribs.

1569
01:30:51,809 --> 01:30:53,802
- You're standing on my foot!
- Oh, sorry!

1570
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:55,405
So I'll see you when I get back?

1571
01:30:55,484 --> 01:30:57,146
- Mm-hmm.
- All right?

1572
01:30:57,220 --> 01:31:00,523
- Mmm. I love you.
- I love you too, baby.

1573
01:31:00,594 --> 01:31:02,291
All right.

1574
01:31:08,143 --> 01:31:09,771
Get a room, baby.

1575
01:31:09,845 --> 01:31:12,578
Can we? Do we have time?

1576
01:31:12,651 --> 01:31:14,712
When are you
coming back through?

1577
01:31:14,789 --> 01:31:16,122
A biker never knows.

1578
01:31:16,192 --> 01:31:18,321
Maybe a week.

1579
01:31:18,396 --> 01:31:20,059
Maybe a month.

1580
01:31:20,935 --> 01:31:23,303
Six days, ten hours, 27 minutes,

1581
01:31:23,373 --> 01:31:26,368
give or take six minutes
for wind resistance.

1582
01:31:30,788 --> 01:31:33,624
Well, I sure do wish
you guys would stick around.

1583
01:31:33,694 --> 01:31:36,165
We got some riding to do, sheriff.
Thanks anyway.

1584
01:31:36,233 --> 01:31:37,724
Well, I'll just say it:

1585
01:31:37,802 --> 01:31:39,863
You fellas were
a blessing to this place.

1586
01:31:39,940 --> 01:31:42,002
I mean, I'm not gonna
get all emotional

1587
01:31:42,078 --> 01:31:44,605
like old hamburger head
over here always...

1588
01:31:46,620 --> 01:31:48,283
What did you
just call me?

1589
01:31:48,357 --> 01:31:51,227
Uh, see, when we walked up,
you were on my...

1590
01:31:51,296 --> 01:31:54,291
You son of a bitch!

1591
01:31:55,104 --> 01:31:57,507
Come on, Buck, I swear.
That's the first time!

1592
01:31:57,576 --> 01:32:00,103
- I don't wanna hear it!
- Well, honestly, you can't.

1593
01:32:00,181 --> 01:32:01,844
I heard that.

1594
01:32:01,918 --> 01:32:04,890
- Ready to ride, guys?
- Ready to ride, baby.

1595
01:32:04,957 --> 01:32:07,053
Let's see what the
West Coast has to offer.

1596
01:32:07,129 --> 01:32:09,326
Think there'll be
any trouble along the way?

1597
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:11,336
Oh, I hope so.

1598
01:32:11,404 --> 01:32:13,340
Yeah, I like
the way you think.

1599
01:32:13,408 --> 01:32:15,435
I like the way you think.

1600
01:32:32,981 --> 01:32:35,384
I'm OK!
I just hurt my face.

1601
01:33:28,193 --> 01:33:29,594
Wow.

1602
01:33:31,132 --> 01:33:34,002
- Hey, we did it!
- Woo-hoo!

1603
01:33:34,072 --> 01:33:35,666
Do you believe this?

1604
01:33:40,318 --> 01:33:43,051
- Hello!
- Whoa, my goodness.

1605
01:33:43,124 --> 01:33:45,424
Whoa, oh, no. Oh, no.
Oh! Whoa!

1606
01:33:45,495 --> 01:33:47,830
Whoa! Ah!

1607
01:33:47,900 --> 01:33:48,890
Whoa!

1608
01:33:49,403 --> 01:33:51,966
Whoa! Sorry, sorry.

1609
01:33:53,545 --> 01:33:55,981
Two thousand miles,
but I finally got it.

1610
01:33:56,050 --> 01:33:58,749
'Bout time, rookie!

1611
01:34:00,726 --> 01:34:04,291
- Lot of distractions.
- California, baby!

1612
01:34:23,473 --> 01:34:25,909
<i>Welcome back
to Extreme Makeover: Home Edition.</i>

1613
01:34:25,977 --> 01:34:28,278
Now, we've met
some incredible families,

1614
01:34:28,349 --> 01:34:30,615
but this could be
the saddest story we've...

1615
01:34:30,687 --> 01:34:31,950
We've ever seen.

1616
01:34:32,023 --> 01:34:34,187
This family has lost everything.

1617
01:34:34,261 --> 01:34:37,324
They've lost their home,
they've lost their history,

1618
01:34:37,401 --> 01:34:39,030
they've lost their heritage.

1619
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:41,631
But this week, we've done
something about that.

1620
01:34:41,709 --> 01:34:44,876
So let's welcome back...
the Del Fuego family!

1621
01:34:51,195 --> 01:34:52,789
Well, Jack, two months ago, man,

1622
01:34:52,866 --> 01:34:54,665
you lost the only home
you ever knew.

1623
01:34:54,736 --> 01:34:57,367
But thanks to a call
from your friends, the Wild Hogs,

1624
01:34:57,442 --> 01:34:58,705
we built you a new one.

1625
01:34:58,777 --> 01:35:00,747
That's so great.

1626
01:35:00,815 --> 01:35:03,878
They... He didn't have to
mention us. That's... Oh, man.

1627
01:35:03,954 --> 01:35:05,685
<i>So you guys know what to say?</i>

1628
01:35:05,758 --> 01:35:09,391
- Say it with me!
- Bus driver, move that bus!

1629
01:35:13,975 --> 01:35:15,945
Oh!

1630
01:35:16,648 --> 01:35:18,082
Wow!

1631
01:35:25,097 --> 01:35:27,898
Usually we have some
pretty emotional reactions,

1632
01:35:27,970 --> 01:35:30,567
but, uh, Jack, you know, wow.

1633
01:35:30,642 --> 01:35:35,107
I'm not sure what
was going on with Jack.

1634
01:35:35,185 --> 01:35:36,744
Oh...

1635
01:35:36,821 --> 01:35:39,349
Thanks to our friends at Sears
and local breweries,

1636
01:35:39,427 --> 01:35:43,128
who provided state-of-the-art taps
and a year's supply of free beer!

1637
01:35:47,009 --> 01:35:49,913
Oh, my God! That is so cool!

1638
01:35:49,982 --> 01:35:51,747
That is so cool!

1639
01:35:51,819 --> 01:35:54,255
Cool as a parking lot
made out of real leather?

1640
01:35:54,323 --> 01:35:56,590
- Oh!
- That is so rad!

1641
01:35:56,662 --> 01:35:58,757
That is so rad!

1642
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:05,906
The bar was my home.
When it went down...

1643
01:36:05,981 --> 01:36:09,147
I felt... homeless.

1644
01:36:10,089 --> 01:36:13,619
Del Fuegos,
go check out your new home!

1645
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:21,710
Here's the thing, you're
talking about a bunch of guys

1646
01:36:21,780 --> 01:36:24,843
that grew up in broken homes.
They really didn't have a home.

1647
01:36:24,919 --> 01:36:27,082
And now they've got one.
With a bidet in it.

1648
01:36:27,157 --> 01:36:30,756
Thank you!

1649
01:36:34,405 --> 01:36:37,400
We love our bar.
Thanks, America!

1650
01:36:38,313 --> 01:36:40,112
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

1651
01:36:40,184 --> 01:36:42,051
Wild Hogs!

1652
01:36:44,180 --> 01:36:52,058
THE END
