2
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,515
Grandpa!

3
00:01:25,588 --> 00:01:29,417
You're not supposed to be up here,
looking at that.

4
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,947
I just wanted to know.

5
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,442
Well, you're old enough, I suppose.

6
00:01:36,308 --> 00:01:38,959
You should know the story.

7
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:42,704
OK, here we go.

8
00:01:43,669 --> 00:01:46,604
It was 1832.

9
00:01:47,637 --> 00:01:50,736
On a night much like this.

10
00:01:55,477 --> 00:01:56,460
Yah!

11
00:01:57,366 --> 00:02:03,411
<i>Charles Carroll was the last surviving
signer of the Declaration of Independence.</i>

12
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,728
<i>He was also a member
of a secret society known as the Masons.</i>

13
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,125
<i>And he knew he was dying.</i>

14
00:02:11,862 --> 00:02:14,252
<i>He woke up his stable boy
in the middle of the night</i>

15
00:02:14,326 --> 00:02:18,833
<i>and ordered him to take him to
the White House to see Andrew Jackson.</i>

16
00:02:18,902 --> 00:02:21,902
<i>Because it was urgent
that he speak to the president.</i>

17
00:02:22,871 --> 00:02:24,365
Did he talk to him?

18
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:27,542
No. He never got the chance.

19
00:02:27,607 --> 00:02:29,909
<i>The president wasn't there that night.</i>

20
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,353
But Charles Carroll had a secret.

21
00:02:34,423 --> 00:02:38,482
So he took into his confidence
the one person he could,

22
00:02:38,551 --> 00:02:41,398
my grandfather's grandfather,

23
00:02:42,135 --> 00:02:43,924
<i>Thomas Gates.</i>

24
00:02:43,992 --> 00:02:46,097
What was the secret?

25
00:02:48,792 --> 00:02:49,741
A treasure.

26
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,800
A treasure beyond all imagining.

27
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:01,745
<i>A treasure that had been
fought over for centuries</i>

28
00:03:01,816 --> 00:03:06,039
<i>by tyrants. Pharaohs.
Emperors. Warlords.</i>

29
00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:09,678
<i>And every time it changed hands
it grew larger.</i>

30
00:03:12,537 --> 00:03:14,992
And then suddenly...

31
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:17,329
it vanished.

32
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:22,132
<i>It didn't reappear
for more than a thousand years.</i>

33
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,958
<i>When knights from the First Crusade</i>

34
00:03:24,025 --> 00:03:27,320
<i>discovered secret vaults
beneath the Temple of Solomon.</i>

35
00:03:27,386 --> 00:03:29,807
<i>You see. The knights who found the vaults</i>

36
00:03:29,882 --> 00:03:34,138
<i>believed that the treasure
was too great for any one man -</i>

37
00:03:34,202 --> 00:03:36,111
<i>not even a king.</i>

38
00:03:36,186 --> 00:03:42,231
<i>They brought the treasure back to Europe
and took the name "the Knights Templar."</i>

39
00:03:44,635 --> 00:03:47,570
<i>Over the next century
they smuggled it out of Europe</i>

40
00:03:47,642 --> 00:03:50,457
<i>and they formed a new brotherhood
called the Freemasons.</i>

41
00:03:50,523 --> 00:03:53,206
<i>In honor of
the builders of the great temple.</i>

42
00:03:54,523 --> 00:03:55,952
<i>War followed.</i>

43
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:59,824
<i>By the time of the American Revolution
the treasure had been hidden again.</i>

44
00:03:59,899 --> 00:04:01,971
<i>By then the Masons included</i>

45
00:04:02,043 --> 00:04:06,004
<i>George Washington.
Benjamin Franklin. Paul Revere.</i>

46
00:04:07,003 --> 00:04:08,727
<i>They knew they had to make sure</i>

47
00:04:08,795 --> 00:04:12,090
<i>the treasure would never fall
into the hands of the British.</i>

48
00:04:12,156 --> 00:04:16,117
So they devised a series of clues
and maps to its location.

49
00:04:16,188 --> 00:04:18,905
Over time the clues were lost or forgotten,

50
00:04:18,972 --> 00:04:21,077
until only one remained -

51
00:04:21,148 --> 00:04:26,899
and that was the secret that Charles Carroll
entrusted to young Thomas Gates.

52
00:04:32,733 --> 00:04:33,715
Charlotte.

53
00:04:34,557 --> 00:04:37,873
"The secret lies with Charlotte."

54
00:04:38,525 --> 00:04:40,248
Who's Charlotte?

55
00:04:40,317 --> 00:04:43,863
Oh... not even Mr. Carroll knew that.

56
00:04:43,933 --> 00:04:45,689
Now look here, Ben.

57
00:04:45,757 --> 00:04:50,013
The Freemasons
among our Founding Fathers left us clues.

58
00:04:50,077 --> 00:04:51,506
Like these.

59
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:54,713
The unfinished pyramid.
The all-seeing eye.

60
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:59,288
Symbols of the Knights Templar,
guardians of the treasure.

61
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:04,918
- They're speaking to us through these.
- You mean laughing at us.

62
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,707
You know what that dollar represents?

63
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:10,262
The entire Gates family fortune.

64
00:05:10,335 --> 00:05:14,558
Six generations of fools...
chasing after fool's gold.

65
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:17,918
It's not about the money,
Patrick. It's never been about the money.

66
00:05:17,982 --> 00:05:20,055
Come on, son. Time to go.

67
00:05:20,671 --> 00:05:23,322
You can... say your goodbyes.

68
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,056
Grandpa?

69
00:05:32,127 --> 00:05:33,720
Hm?

70
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,242
Are we knights?

71
00:05:39,647 --> 00:05:41,982
Do you want to be?

72
00:05:42,048 --> 00:05:45,364
All right. Um... kneel.

73
00:05:56,544 --> 00:05:58,367
Benjamin Franklin Gates,

74
00:05:58,433 --> 00:06:03,801
you take upon yourself the duty
of the Templars, the Freemasons

75
00:06:03,873 --> 00:06:06,688
and the family Gates.

76
00:06:07,425 --> 00:06:09,367
Do you so swear?

77
00:06:09,441 --> 00:06:11,351
I so swear.

78
00:06:33,058 --> 00:06:35,327
I was thinking about
Henson and Peary,

79
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:39,802
crossing this kind of terrain with nothing
more than dog sleds and on foot.

80
00:06:39,874 --> 00:06:42,394
- Can you imagine?
- It's extraordinary.

81
00:06:48,227 --> 00:06:50,136
We getting closer?

82
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:54,040
Assuming Ben's theory's correct
and my tracking model's accurate,

83
00:06:54,115 --> 00:06:56,734
<i>we should be getting very close.</i>

84
00:06:56,803 --> 00:07:00,283
But don't go by me -
I broke a shoelace this morning.

85
00:07:03,395 --> 00:07:06,941
- It's... it's a bad omen.
- Shall we turn around and go home?

86
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:10,011
Or we could pull over
and just throw him out here.

87
00:07:11,811 --> 00:07:12,989
OK.

88
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,541
Riley, you're not missing that little
windowless cubicle we found you in?

89
00:07:16,612 --> 00:07:18,652
No, no. Absolutely not.

90
00:07:36,037 --> 00:07:38,754
Why are we stopping?
I thought we were looking for a ship.

91
00:07:38,821 --> 00:07:42,683
- I don't see any ship.
- She's out there.

92
00:07:52,549 --> 00:07:55,866
Look... this is a waste of time.

93
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:58,844
How could a ship wind up way out here?

94
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:01,918
Well, I'm no expert, but...

95
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:04,990
it could be that the hydrothermic properties
of this region

96
00:08:05,063 --> 00:08:07,583
produce hurricane-force ice storms

97
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:11,549
that cause the ocean to freeze
and then melt and then refreeze,

98
00:08:11,623 --> 00:08:16,096
resulting in a semisolid
migrating land mass

99
00:08:16,167 --> 00:08:19,680
that would land a ship right around here.

100
00:09:06,697 --> 00:09:08,421
Hello, beautiful.

101
00:09:16,329 --> 00:09:19,591
Have Viktor
check the fuel in the generators.

102
00:09:20,042 --> 00:09:24,744
Two years ago, if you hadn't shown up,
hadn't believed the treasure was real,

103
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,014
<i>I don't know
if I ever would have found Charlotte.</i>

104
00:09:27,082 --> 00:09:29,765
You would have found it, I have no doubt.

105
00:09:29,834 --> 00:09:34,057
That's why I didn't think it was
as crazy an investment as everyone said.

106
00:09:34,378 --> 00:09:38,405
<i>I'm just relieved that I'm not as crazy
as everyone says. Or said my dad was.</i>

107
00:09:38,827 --> 00:09:42,853
Or my granddad. Or my great-granddad.

108
00:09:43,402 --> 00:09:45,126
OK!

109
00:09:45,195 --> 00:09:47,170
Let's go!

110
00:09:47,915 --> 00:09:51,744
- Let's go find some treasure.
- Yeah, bring us back something.

111
00:10:01,995 --> 00:10:03,140
Urgh.

112
00:10:28,972 --> 00:10:31,111
Oh, God!

113
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,689
You handled that well.

114
00:10:36,717 --> 00:10:39,019
This is it.

115
00:10:39,469 --> 00:10:41,292
It's the cargo hold.

116
00:10:53,102 --> 00:10:55,753
Do you think it's in the barrels?

117
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:15,367
Gunpowder.

118
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:18,981
Ooh! Ooh! OK...

119
00:11:24,207 --> 00:11:27,502
Why would the captain
be guarding this barrel?

120
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,510
I found something!

121
00:11:59,824 --> 00:12:01,734
What is it?

122
00:12:18,514 --> 00:12:20,653
Do you guys know what this is?

123
00:12:21,106 --> 00:12:23,310
Is it a billion-dollar pipe?

124
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:28,327
It's a meerschaum pipe.
Ah, that is beautiful.

125
00:12:28,402 --> 00:12:31,664
Look at the intricacy of the scrollwork
on the stem.

126
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,757
- Is it a million-dollar pipe?
- No, it's a clue.

127
00:12:35,827 --> 00:12:38,477
Let me see that.

128
00:12:39,442 --> 00:12:41,581
No, don't break it!

129
00:12:41,651 --> 00:12:44,172
We are one step closer to the treasure,
gentlemen.

130
00:12:44,243 --> 00:12:46,763
<i>Ben, I thought you said that
the treasure would be on the Charlotte.</i>

131
00:12:46,835 --> 00:12:49,224
<i>No, "The secret lies with Charlotte."</i>

132
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:51,306
<i>I said it could be here.</i>

133
00:13:07,508 --> 00:13:10,028
It's Templar symbols.

134
00:13:16,244 --> 00:13:18,186
"The legend writ."

135
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,300
"The stain effected."

136
00:13:20,372 --> 00:13:23,340
"The key in Silence undetected."

137
00:13:23,893 --> 00:13:26,763
"Fifty-five in iron pen."

138
00:13:27,796 --> 00:13:30,098
"Mr. Matlack can't offend."

139
00:13:33,557 --> 00:13:35,662
It's a riddle.

140
00:13:38,677 --> 00:13:40,336
I need to think.

141
00:13:43,702 --> 00:13:45,644
"The legend writ."

142
00:13:45,718 --> 00:13:47,627
"The stain effected."

143
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,379
What legend?

144
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:55,506
There's the legend of the Templar treasure,
and the stain effects the legend.

145
00:13:55,574 --> 00:13:57,549
How?

146
00:13:57,622 --> 00:13:59,956
"The key in Silence undetected."

147
00:14:00,918 --> 00:14:02,828
Wait.

148
00:14:03,703 --> 00:14:07,565
The legend and the key...
Now there's something.

149
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,046
A map.

150
00:14:09,111 --> 00:14:11,794
Maps have legends, maps have keys.

151
00:14:11,863 --> 00:14:13,968
It's a map, an invisible map.
So now...

152
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:17,584
Wait a minute. What do you mean,
"invisible" - "an invisible map"?

153
00:14:17,655 --> 00:14:21,779
"The stain effected"
could refer to a dye or a reagent

154
00:14:21,848 --> 00:14:24,303
used to bring about a certain result.

155
00:14:24,376 --> 00:14:27,125
Combined with
"The key in Silence undetected,"

156
00:14:27,192 --> 00:14:31,981
the implication is that the effect is to make
what was undetectable detectable.

157
00:14:32,696 --> 00:14:36,722
Unless...
"The key in Silence" could be...

158
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:39,214
Prison.

159
00:14:39,993 --> 00:14:41,651
Albuquerque.

160
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,208
See, I can do it too.
Snorkel.

161
00:14:44,281 --> 00:14:46,931
That's where the map is.
Like he said, "Fifty-five in iron pen."

162
00:14:47,001 --> 00:14:48,408
"Iron pen" is a prison.

163
00:14:48,473 --> 00:14:53,688
Or it could be, since the primary writing
medium of the time was iron gall ink,

164
00:14:53,753 --> 00:14:56,567
the "pen" is... just a pen.

165
00:14:56,633 --> 00:15:00,888
But then why not say a pen?
Why... why say "iron pen"?

166
00:15:01,689 --> 00:15:03,664
'Cause it's a prison.

167
00:15:03,738 --> 00:15:07,699
Wait a minute. "Iron pen" - the "iron"
does not describe the ink in the pen,

168
00:15:08,538 --> 00:15:11,255
<i>it describes what was penned.</i>

169
00:15:11,322 --> 00:15:14,453
It was "iron" -
it was firm, it was mineral...

170
00:15:14,521 --> 00:15:16,115
No, no, no, that's stupid.

171
00:15:16,185 --> 00:15:21,423
It was... It was firm,
it was adamant, it was resolved.

172
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,040
It was resolved.

173
00:15:25,786 --> 00:15:27,695
"Mr. Matlack can't offend."

174
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:31,283
Timothy Matlack was the official scribe
of the Continental Congress.

175
00:15:31,354 --> 00:15:35,511
Calligrapher, not writer. And to make sure
he could not offend the map,

176
00:15:35,578 --> 00:15:39,223
it was put on the back of a resolution
that he transcribed,

177
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:43,066
a resolution that 55 men signed.

178
00:15:45,691 --> 00:15:48,440
The Declaration of Independence.

179
00:15:50,524 --> 00:15:51,985
Oh!

180
00:15:54,812 --> 00:15:59,067
Come on, there's no invisible map on the
back of the Declaration of Independence.

181
00:15:59,131 --> 00:16:01,520
That's clever, really.
A document of that importance

182
00:16:01,596 --> 00:16:03,735
would ensure the map's survival.

183
00:16:03,804 --> 00:16:06,488
And you said there were several Masons
signed it, yeah?

184
00:16:06,556 --> 00:16:09,687
Yeah. Nine, for sure.

185
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:14,353
We'll have to arrange a way to examine it.

186
00:16:14,429 --> 00:16:17,528
This is one of the most important
documents in history.

187
00:16:17,597 --> 00:16:21,787
They're not just gonna let us waltz in there
and run chemical tests on it.

188
00:16:21,853 --> 00:16:24,308
- Then what do you propose we do?
- I don't know!

189
00:16:27,997 --> 00:16:30,070
We could borrow it.

190
00:16:31,006 --> 00:16:32,915
Steal it?

191
00:16:34,269 --> 00:16:37,084
- I don't think so.
- Ben...

192
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:40,466
the treasure of the Knights Templar
is the treasure of all treasures.

193
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:43,127
Oh, I didn't know that.
Really?

194
00:16:43,934 --> 00:16:48,124
Look, Ben... I understand your bitterness.
I really do.

195
00:16:48,478 --> 00:16:50,486
You've spent your entire life
searching for this treasure,

196
00:16:50,558 --> 00:16:52,664
only to have
the respected historical community

197
00:16:52,734 --> 00:16:56,411
treat you and your family
with mockery and contempt.

198
00:16:56,478 --> 00:16:58,900
You should be able to rub this treasure
in their arrogant faces,

199
00:16:58,974 --> 00:17:01,560
and I want you to have
the chance to do that.

200
00:17:02,527 --> 00:17:03,989
How?

201
00:17:04,383 --> 00:17:07,034
We all have our areas of expertise.

202
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:11,476
You don't think mine are limited
to writing checks, do you?

203
00:17:11,551 --> 00:17:13,722
In another life...

204
00:17:14,527 --> 00:17:19,994
I arranged a number of operations of...
questionable legality.

205
00:17:22,495 --> 00:17:24,764
I'd take his word for it, if I were you.

206
00:17:26,624 --> 00:17:30,715
So don't worry.
I'll make all the arrangements.

207
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,367
No.

208
00:17:38,816 --> 00:17:41,434
I'd really need your help here.

209
00:17:41,504 --> 00:17:46,839
Ian... I'm not gonna let you steal
the Declaration of Independence.

210
00:17:46,912 --> 00:17:49,018
OK.

211
00:17:49,088 --> 00:17:52,285
From this point on
all you're going to be is a hindrance.

212
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:55,772
Hey!

213
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:59,616
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna shoot me, Shaw?

214
00:18:00,193 --> 00:18:02,876
Well, you can't shoot me.
There's more to the riddle.

215
00:18:02,945 --> 00:18:06,077
Information you don't have. I do.

216
00:18:06,146 --> 00:18:09,081
I'm the only one who can figure it out,
and you know that.

217
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:11,390
He's bluffing.

218
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:14,010
We played poker together, Ian.
You know I can't bluff.

219
00:18:14,082 --> 00:18:16,384
Tell me what I need to know, Ben,

220
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:18,622
or I'll shoot your friend.

221
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,064
Hey!

222
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,367
Quiet, Riley!
Your job's finished here.

223
00:18:26,882 --> 00:18:30,908
Look where you're standing.
All that gunpowder.

224
00:18:30,978 --> 00:18:34,656
You shoot me,
I drop this, we all go up.

225
00:18:36,003 --> 00:18:37,312
Ben...

226
00:18:38,531 --> 00:18:41,531
What happens when the flare burns down?

227
00:18:43,043 --> 00:18:45,596
Tell me what I need to know, Ben.

228
00:18:47,491 --> 00:18:49,051
You need to know...

229
00:18:49,123 --> 00:18:51,011
if Shaw can catch.

230
00:18:56,644 --> 00:18:58,237
Nice try, though.

231
00:19:09,157 --> 00:19:11,066
Get out, Shaw!

232
00:19:19,365 --> 00:19:20,926
Fool!

233
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,882
Riley, get over here!

234
00:19:32,069 --> 00:19:34,524
- What is this?
- Smuggler's hold. Get in!

235
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:41,220
Move! Get out of here!

236
00:19:41,286 --> 00:19:42,879
- What?
- Move! Get out!

237
00:19:44,006 --> 00:19:45,916
Follow me.

238
00:19:49,414 --> 00:19:51,170
Let's go, let's go!
She's gonna blow!

239
00:19:57,959 --> 00:20:00,031
Get down.

240
00:20:29,736 --> 00:20:33,151
OK, let's go.
Before someone sees the smoke.

241
00:21:02,601 --> 00:21:05,503
There's an Inuit village
about nine miles east of here.

242
00:21:05,578 --> 00:21:09,440
- It's popular with bush pilots.
- All right.

243
00:21:14,186 --> 00:21:17,666
- Then what are we gonna do?
- Start making our way back home.

244
00:21:17,738 --> 00:21:21,929
No, I meant about Ian. He's gonna steal
the Declaration of Independence, Ben.

245
00:21:23,114 --> 00:21:24,740
We stop him.

246
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,336
Is it really so hard to believe

247
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:45,770
that someone's gonna try to steal
the Declaration of Independence?

248
00:21:45,836 --> 00:21:48,203
The FBI gets 10,000 tips a week.

249
00:21:48,268 --> 00:21:50,570
They're not gonna worry about
something they're sure is safe.

250
00:21:50,636 --> 00:21:53,091
But anyone that can do anything
is gonna think we're crazy.

251
00:21:53,164 --> 00:21:56,164
Anyone crazy enough to believe us
isn't gonna want to help.

252
00:21:56,236 --> 00:22:00,841
We don't need someone crazy. But one
step short of crazy, what do you get?

253
00:22:00,908 --> 00:22:02,501
Obsessed.

254
00:22:02,573 --> 00:22:04,198
Passionate.

255
00:22:11,693 --> 00:22:13,897
Excuse me.

256
00:22:18,349 --> 00:22:20,869
- Dr. Chase can see you now, Mr. Brown.
- Thank you.

257
00:22:20,941 --> 00:22:22,151
Mr. Brown?

258
00:22:22,221 --> 00:22:25,451
The family name doesn't get a lot
of respect in the academic community.

259
00:22:25,517 --> 00:22:27,524
Huh. Being kept down by the man.

260
00:22:29,837 --> 00:22:31,692
A very cute man.

261
00:22:31,758 --> 00:22:33,994
Thank you.

262
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:36,134
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- Hi.

263
00:22:36,685 --> 00:22:38,758
- Abigail Chase.
- Paul Brown.

264
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:41,099
- Nice to meet you.
- Bill.

265
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,590
Nice to meet you, Bill.

266
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:46,793
- How may I help you?
- Your accent. Pennsylvania Dutch?

267
00:22:46,862 --> 00:22:49,677
- Saxony German.
- Oh!

268
00:22:49,742 --> 00:22:52,459
- You're not American?
- Oh, I am an American.

269
00:22:52,527 --> 00:22:55,494
I just wasn't born here.
Please don't touch that!

270
00:22:55,567 --> 00:22:58,982
Sorry. A neat collection.
George Washington's campaign buttons.

271
00:22:59,055 --> 00:23:01,608
You're missing the 1789 inaugural, though.

272
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,549
- I found one once.
- That's very fortunate for you.

273
00:23:04,623 --> 00:23:07,471
Now, you told my assistant
that this was an urgent matter.

274
00:23:07,535 --> 00:23:09,608
Ah. Yes, ma'am.

275
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,330
Well, I'm gonna get straight to the point.

276
00:23:13,904 --> 00:23:17,100
Someone's gonna steal
the Declaration of Independence.

277
00:23:19,504 --> 00:23:21,544
It's true.

278
00:23:23,056 --> 00:23:25,096
I think I'd better put you gentlemen
in touch with the FBI.

279
00:23:25,168 --> 00:23:26,990
- We've been to the FBI.
- And?

280
00:23:27,056 --> 00:23:30,352
They assured us that the Declaration
cannot possibly be stolen.

281
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:32,871
- They're right.
- My friend and I are less certain.

282
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:36,774
However, if we were given the privilege
of examining the document...

283
00:23:37,488 --> 00:23:41,351
we would be able to tell you for certain
if it were actually in any danger.

284
00:23:41,424 --> 00:23:43,367
What do you think you're gonna find?

285
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:49,638
We believe that there's an...
encryption on the back.

286
00:23:50,161 --> 00:23:52,943
- An encryption, like a code?
- Yes, ma'am.

287
00:23:53,009 --> 00:23:54,919
Of what?

288
00:23:54,994 --> 00:23:57,863
Uh... a cartograph.

289
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:00,141
- A map.
- Yes, ma'am.

290
00:24:00,594 --> 00:24:03,245
A map of what?

291
00:24:03,314 --> 00:24:05,834
The location of...

292
00:24:05,906 --> 00:24:13,490
...of hidden items
of historic and intrinsic value.

293
00:24:14,994 --> 00:24:18,343
- A treasure map?
- That's where we lost the FBI.

294
00:24:18,418 --> 00:24:21,233
You're treasure-hunters, aren't you?

295
00:24:21,298 --> 00:24:23,568
We're more like treasure-protectors.

296
00:24:24,147 --> 00:24:28,522
Mr. Brown, I have personally seen the back
of the Declaration of Independence,

297
00:24:28,595 --> 00:24:32,719
and I promise you, the only thing there
is a notation that reads,

298
00:24:32,787 --> 00:24:34,675
"Original Declaration of Independence,
dated...

299
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:37,521
"Four of July, 1776." Yes, ma'am.

300
00:24:37,588 --> 00:24:39,311
But no map.

301
00:24:51,988 --> 00:24:54,160
It's invisible.

302
00:24:54,228 --> 00:24:55,951
Oh! Right.

303
00:24:56,276 --> 00:25:00,270
And that's where we lost
the Department of Homeland Security.

304
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:03,373
What led you to assume
there's this invisible map?

305
00:25:03,828 --> 00:25:06,698
We found an engraving
on the stem of a 200-year-old pipe.

306
00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:09,074
Owned by Freemasons.

307
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:13,297
- May I see the pipe?
- Uh, we don't have it.

308
00:25:15,253 --> 00:25:18,548
- Did Big Foot take it?
- It was nice meeting you.

309
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:21,100
Nice to meet you, too.

310
00:25:21,813 --> 00:25:24,082
And, you know,
that really is a nice collection.

311
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:27,378
Must have taken you a long time
to hunt down all that history.

312
00:25:31,317 --> 00:25:34,416
If it's any consolation,
you had me convinced.

313
00:25:34,486 --> 00:25:36,853
It's not.

314
00:25:36,917 --> 00:25:40,562
I was thinking, what if we go public,
plaster the story all over the Internet?

315
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:44,820
It's not like
we have our reputations to worry about.

316
00:25:44,886 --> 00:25:49,109
Although I don't think
that's exactly gonna scare Ian away.

317
00:25:51,351 --> 00:25:54,450
180 years of searching,
and I'm three feet away.

318
00:25:55,351 --> 00:25:57,839
Of all the ideas
that became the United States,

319
00:25:57,911 --> 00:26:01,937
there's a line here
that's at the heart of all the others.

320
00:26:02,007 --> 00:26:05,356
"But when a long train of abuses
and usurpations,

321
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:08,017
pursuing invariably the same object,

322
00:26:08,088 --> 00:26:11,885
evinces a design to reduce them
under absolute despotism,

323
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,734
it is their right, it is their duty
to throw off such government

324
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,149
and provide new guards
for their future security."

325
00:26:20,888 --> 00:26:23,059
People don't talk that way anymore.

326
00:26:23,128 --> 00:26:25,038
Beautiful, huh?

327
00:26:26,552 --> 00:26:29,487
- No idea what you said.
- It means, if there's something wrong,

328
00:26:29,561 --> 00:26:33,751
those who have the ability to take action
have the responsibility to take action.

329
00:26:38,585 --> 00:26:40,440
I'm gonna steal it.

330
00:26:42,681 --> 00:26:44,372
What?

331
00:26:45,369 --> 00:26:48,468
I'm gonna steal
the Declaration of Independence.

332
00:26:52,473 --> 00:26:55,157
Uh... Ben?

333
00:26:56,026 --> 00:26:58,360
This is... huge.

334
00:26:58,937 --> 00:27:01,425
It's prison huge.

335
00:27:01,498 --> 00:27:03,800
You are gonna go to prison,
you know that?

336
00:27:03,866 --> 00:27:06,168
Yeah, probably.

337
00:27:06,234 --> 00:27:08,656
So that would bother most people.

338
00:27:09,306 --> 00:27:13,845
Ian's gonna try and steal it. And if he
succeeds, he'll destroy the Declaration.

339
00:27:13,914 --> 00:27:17,144
<i>The fact is, the only way to protect
the Declaration is to steal it.</i>

340
00:27:17,211 --> 00:27:19,699
It's upside down.

341
00:27:20,987 --> 00:27:23,321
I don't think there's a choice.

342
00:27:24,027 --> 00:27:26,416
Ben, for God's sakes,

343
00:27:26,491 --> 00:27:29,971
it's like stealing a national monument. OK?

344
00:27:30,043 --> 00:27:32,149
It's like stealing him.

345
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:36,759
<i>It can't be done. Not shouldn't be done.
It can't be done.</i>

346
00:27:38,076 --> 00:27:40,378
Let me prove it to you.

347
00:27:40,475 --> 00:27:43,061
OK, Ben, pay attention.

348
00:27:43,132 --> 00:27:45,914
I've brought you to the Library of Congress.

349
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:49,460
Why? Because it's the biggest library
in the world.

350
00:27:49,532 --> 00:27:51,605
Over 20 million books.

351
00:27:51,677 --> 00:27:54,044
And they're all saying
the same exact thing:

352
00:27:54,108 --> 00:27:56,377
Listen to Riley.

353
00:27:56,444 --> 00:28:01,016
What we have here, my friend,
is an entire layout of the archives.

354
00:28:01,084 --> 00:28:03,473
Short of builders' blueprints.

355
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:07,411
You've got construction orders,
phone lines,

356
00:28:08,252 --> 00:28:11,002
water and sewage -
it's all here.

357
00:28:11,069 --> 00:28:14,037
Now, when the Declaration
is on display, OK,

358
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:17,557
it is surrounded by guards
and video monitors

359
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:21,426
<i>and a little family from Iowa and little kids
on their eighth-grade field trip.</i>

360
00:28:21,501 --> 00:28:26,073
<i>And beneath an inch of bulletproof glass
is an army of sensors and heat monitors</i>

361
00:28:26,141 --> 00:28:29,305
<i>that will go off if someone gets too close
with a high fever.</i>

362
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:32,662
Now, when it's not on display,

363
00:28:33,534 --> 00:28:40,441
it is lowered into a four-foot-thick
concrete, steel-plated vault...

364
00:28:41,118 --> 00:28:45,374
that happens to be equipped
with an electronic combination lock

365
00:28:45,439 --> 00:28:47,414
and biometric access-denial systems.

366
00:28:47,487 --> 00:28:51,065
You know, Thomas Edison tried and failed
nearly 2,000 times

367
00:28:51,135 --> 00:28:54,932
to develop the carbonized cotton-thread
filament for the incandescent light bulb.

368
00:28:55,007 --> 00:28:56,349
Edison?

369
00:28:56,415 --> 00:28:58,422
When asked about it,
he said, "I didn't fail,

370
00:28:58,495 --> 00:29:01,178
I found out 2,000 ways
how not to make a light bulb."

371
00:29:01,248 --> 00:29:04,509
But he only needed to find one way
to make it work.

372
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,593
The Preservation Room.
Enjoy. Go ahead.

373
00:29:11,456 --> 00:29:14,140
Do you know
what the Preservation Room is for?

374
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:16,629
Delicious jams and jellies?

375
00:29:16,704 --> 00:29:19,257
No. That's where they clean,
repair and maintain

376
00:29:19,328 --> 00:29:21,084
all the documents
and the storage housings

377
00:29:21,152 --> 00:29:23,324
when they're not on display or in the vault.

378
00:29:23,392 --> 00:29:27,483
Now, when the case needs work they take
it out of the vault, directly across the hall

379
00:29:27,552 --> 00:29:29,308
<i>and into the Preservation Room.</i>

380
00:29:29,377 --> 00:29:33,151
<i>The best time for us. Or Ian. To steal it
would be during the gala this weekend</i>

381
00:29:33,217 --> 00:29:36,217
<i>when the guards are distracted
by the VIPs upstairs.</i>

382
00:29:36,289 --> 00:29:42,137
But we'll make our way to the Preservation
Room, where there's much less security.

383
00:29:43,105 --> 00:29:44,828
Huh.

384
00:29:44,897 --> 00:29:47,167
Well, if Ian...

385
00:29:47,234 --> 00:29:49,143
Uh...

386
00:29:49,217 --> 00:29:51,738
Preservation... Hm.

387
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:53,752
The gala, huh?

388
00:29:55,714 --> 00:29:57,983
This might be possible.

389
00:29:58,657 --> 00:30:00,413
It might.

390
00:30:31,203 --> 00:30:32,381
Ah...

391
00:30:32,835 --> 00:30:35,105
And we are in.

392
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,184
There you are.
Hello.

393
00:30:53,092 --> 00:30:55,002
The hallway.

394
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:02,622
That's what I want.

395
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,659
Game on.

396
00:31:50,567 --> 00:31:51,909
I'll buy that.

397
00:31:56,936 --> 00:31:58,365
Cool.

398
00:32:28,936 --> 00:32:31,140
This just came for you.

399
00:32:31,753 --> 00:32:34,120
I hope it's not from Stan.

400
00:32:36,169 --> 00:32:40,544
"For the woman who has everything else...
Thanks for listening. Paul Brown."

401
00:33:23,467 --> 00:33:25,027
Abigail Chase.

402
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,475
Hey, Mike.

403
00:33:45,548 --> 00:33:48,134
<i>- Let's do this by the book.
- Hallway is secure.</i>

404
00:33:48,205 --> 00:33:50,474
<i>- Keep the document level.
- No problem.</i>

405
00:33:51,244 --> 00:33:52,193
<i> What have you got?</i>

406
00:33:52,268 --> 00:33:54,156
<i> The heat sensor went off
in the Declaration frame.</i>

407
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:57,668
<i> Run full diagnostics.
Then I want them all changed out.</i>

408
00:33:57,741 --> 00:34:00,327
Our evil plan is working.

409
00:34:38,382 --> 00:34:40,324
Ben, are you sure that we should?

410
00:34:43,663 --> 00:34:44,939
<i> Riley.</i>

411
00:34:45,487 --> 00:34:47,756
<i>- Can you hear me?
- Unfortunately. Yeah.</i>

412
00:34:47,823 --> 00:34:49,482
<i>We're all set in here.</i>

413
00:34:49,551 --> 00:34:52,747
You want to go around to the front
and present your invitation.

414
00:34:52,815 --> 00:34:55,499
You're gonna have to show ID.
Go ahead, man.

415
00:34:59,727 --> 00:35:01,637
Howdy.

416
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:09,353
I need your invitation
and your ID, please.

417
00:35:26,865 --> 00:35:29,036
<i> How do you look?</i>

418
00:35:29,105 --> 00:35:32,040
<i>- Not bad.
- Mazel tov.</i>

419
00:35:39,089 --> 00:35:40,999
This is it.

420
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:14,825
For you.

421
00:36:14,899 --> 00:36:17,233
- Oh, Mr. Brown.
- Dr. Chase.

422
00:36:17,299 --> 00:36:20,528
<i>- What are you doing here?
- Is that that hot girl?</i>

423
00:36:20,596 --> 00:36:25,484
<i>- How does she look?
- I made a last-minute donation. A big one.</i>

424
00:36:25,555 --> 00:36:28,108
Well, on that subject,
thank you for your wonderful gift.

425
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:31,027
- Oh, you did get it? Good.
- Yes, thank you.

426
00:36:31,092 --> 00:36:35,085
You know, I really couldn't accept
something like that normally, but...

427
00:36:35,155 --> 00:36:37,065
I really want it.

428
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:40,271
<i>- Well, you needed it.
- Come on. Romeo. Get outta there.</i>

429
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:44,202
I have been wondering, though,
what the engraving indicated

430
00:36:44,276 --> 00:36:47,375
- on the pipe that Big Foot took.
- Hi.

431
00:36:47,796 --> 00:36:51,920
- Here you go.
- Oh, Dr. Herbert, this is Mr. Brown.

432
00:36:51,988 --> 00:36:53,068
- Hi.
- Hi there.

433
00:36:53,141 --> 00:36:56,524
<i>- Who's the stiff?
- Here, why don't you let me take that?</i>

434
00:36:56,597 --> 00:37:00,012
- So you can take that off his hands.
- Thank you.

435
00:37:01,077 --> 00:37:03,149
A toast, yeah?

436
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,294
To high treason.

437
00:37:05,366 --> 00:37:08,627
That's what these men were committing
when they signed the Declaration.

438
00:37:08,694 --> 00:37:13,713
Had we lost the war, they would have been
hanged, beheaded, drawn and quartered,

439
00:37:13,782 --> 00:37:18,092
and - Oh! Oh, my personal favorite -
and had their entrails cut out and burned!

440
00:37:20,214 --> 00:37:24,971
So, here's to the men
who did what was considered wrong

441
00:37:25,046 --> 00:37:28,013
in order to do what they knew was right.

442
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:31,059
What they knew was right.

443
00:37:42,071 --> 00:37:43,893
Well, good night.

444
00:37:43,959 --> 00:37:46,098
- Good night.
- Good night.

445
00:38:01,496 --> 00:38:03,765
Yeah!

446
00:38:05,336 --> 00:38:06,481
OK, go! Go!

447
00:38:18,808 --> 00:38:20,401
This better work.

448
00:38:26,553 --> 00:38:27,251
Clear!

449
00:38:32,473 --> 00:38:35,823
- On.
- Door one. 30 seconds.

450
00:38:44,346 --> 00:38:46,256
How does it look?

451
00:38:48,282 --> 00:38:51,413
It's working.
It's working...

452
00:38:51,482 --> 00:38:52,856
Unbelievable.

453
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:14,874
Second door. 90 seconds.

454
00:39:27,292 --> 00:39:29,812
Well done, boys. Let's go.

455
00:39:42,364 --> 00:39:44,753
- We're in the elevator.
- OK.

456
00:39:44,829 --> 00:39:46,967
I'm gonna turn off
the surveillance cameras. Ready?

457
00:39:47,549 --> 00:39:49,883
<i>In five. Four.</i>

458
00:39:49,948 --> 00:39:52,021
Three... Now.

459
00:39:53,821 --> 00:39:55,031
Ben Gates,

460
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:57,654
you are now the Invisible Man.

461
00:40:02,589 --> 00:40:05,273
- I'm here.
- Give me the letters for her password.

462
00:40:05,342 --> 00:40:07,414
What do you got for me?

463
00:40:10,046 --> 00:40:11,672
Hit me with it.

464
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,651
A-E-F-G...

465
00:40:13,726 --> 00:40:16,573
<i>L-O-R-V-Y.</i>

466
00:40:17,054 --> 00:40:19,924
Anagrams being listed.

467
00:40:19,998 --> 00:40:21,973
OK.

468
00:40:22,046 --> 00:40:24,632
Top results: "A glove fry."

469
00:40:24,703 --> 00:40:26,197
"A very golf."

470
00:40:26,271 --> 00:40:28,059
"Fargo levy."

471
00:40:28,127 --> 00:40:30,298
"Gravy floe. Valey frog."

472
00:40:30,366 --> 00:40:33,148
Also "Ago fly rev."

473
00:40:33,215 --> 00:40:35,516
Uh..."Grove fly a."

474
00:40:35,583 --> 00:40:37,339
"Are fly gov."

475
00:40:37,407 --> 00:40:39,545
"Era fly gov."

476
00:40:39,615 --> 00:40:41,851
<i>- "Elf gov ray."
- It's "Valley Forge."</i>

477
00:40:42,751 --> 00:40:45,271
"Valley For..."
I don't have that on my computer.

478
00:40:45,343 --> 00:40:48,311
It's "Valley Forge" -
she pressed the E and L twice.

479
00:40:54,271 --> 00:40:56,181
<i> We're in.</i>

480
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,422
Hello.

481
00:41:07,008 --> 00:41:08,983
Ben, you're doing great.

482
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:19,350
Ben, pick it up.

483
00:41:27,745 --> 00:41:29,633
You got about one...

484
00:41:34,145 --> 00:41:35,422
We own video.

485
00:41:36,194 --> 00:41:38,682
- I lost my feed.
- What?

486
00:41:38,754 --> 00:41:40,510
I lost my feed, Ben.

487
00:41:40,578 --> 00:41:42,520
<i>I don't know where anyone is.
I have nothing.</i>

488
00:41:42,594 --> 00:41:44,055
Ben, I have no...
Ben, I have nothing.

489
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:46,749
Get out of there.
Get out of there now.

490
00:41:46,818 --> 00:41:49,273
I'm taking the whole thing.
I'll get it out in the elevator.

491
00:41:49,346 --> 00:41:51,997
What are you talking about?
Is it heavy?

492
00:41:57,315 --> 00:41:59,736
Shaw. Door three, one minute.

493
00:42:15,043 --> 00:42:16,505
Gates.

494
00:42:20,868 --> 00:42:22,908
What was that?

495
00:42:24,932 --> 00:42:26,720
Who's shooting?

496
00:42:28,292 --> 00:42:30,464
- Damn.
- He's got the bloody map!

497
00:42:30,884 --> 00:42:33,437
Are you still there? Ben?

498
00:42:33,508 --> 00:42:35,068
I'm in the elevator.

499
00:42:35,652 --> 00:42:40,639
- Ian’s here. There was, uh, shooting.
- I hate that guy.

500
00:42:45,157 --> 00:42:49,467
Hey, Rebecca.
Do you have a Paul Brown on that list?

501
00:42:49,541 --> 00:42:50,970
Paul Brown?

502
00:42:51,045 --> 00:42:52,571
Uh, no. Not here.

503
00:43:05,701 --> 00:43:07,457
Have a good night.

504
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:17,125
Are you trying to steal that?

505
00:43:18,246 --> 00:43:19,523
Oh, uh...

506
00:43:21,959 --> 00:43:23,617
It's $35.

507
00:43:25,127 --> 00:43:27,331
- For this?
- Yeah.

508
00:43:27,399 --> 00:43:30,399
- That's a lot.
- Hey, I don't make the prices.

509
00:43:33,223 --> 00:43:35,263
It's, um...

510
00:43:37,511 --> 00:43:39,038
I have $32...

511
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,836
57 c.

512
00:43:45,479 --> 00:43:47,901
We take Visa.

513
00:43:57,064 --> 00:43:59,399
This is Mike. Sublevel three.
I have an alert.

514
00:43:59,464 --> 00:44:02,017
Where are you, Ben?

515
00:44:25,609 --> 00:44:28,097
<i>- Where are you?
- Stop talking.</i>

516
00:44:29,514 --> 00:44:31,685
Start the van.

517
00:44:37,674 --> 00:44:42,660
Ben, the...
the mean Declaration lady's behind you.

518
00:44:47,242 --> 00:44:48,933
Hey.

519
00:44:49,002 --> 00:44:51,490
Oh, it's you. Hello.

520
00:44:51,562 --> 00:44:54,148
Mr. Brown, what's going on?
What's that?

521
00:44:55,019 --> 00:44:57,255
- It's a souvenir.
- Really?

522
00:44:57,322 --> 00:44:59,265
Stop chatting and get in the van.

523
00:45:04,843 --> 00:45:06,698
Code red. Code red.
We have a break-in.

524
00:45:06,763 --> 00:45:10,505
Lock it down. Nobody leaves the building.
Get the FBI on the phone.

525
00:45:14,507 --> 00:45:17,028
- Did you enjoy the party?
- Yeah.

526
00:45:20,844 --> 00:45:23,746
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God! You did not?

527
00:45:24,395 --> 00:45:26,435
- No...
- Security! Over here!

528
00:45:26,508 --> 00:45:28,418
- Give me that!
- It's yours. Take it.

529
00:45:29,068 --> 00:45:30,726
- Security!
- Uh-uh-uh.

530
00:45:30,796 --> 00:45:34,571
- Over here! Security!
- Got you.

531
00:45:35,245 --> 00:45:36,193
Go.

532
00:45:36,268 --> 00:45:38,275
Viktor! Move!

533
00:45:38,348 --> 00:45:40,356
- We can't just let her go!
- We can. Go!

534
00:45:41,645 --> 00:45:44,230
- Security, over here!
- Wait. No, hold it.

535
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:45,861
Hold it!

536
00:45:47,981 --> 00:45:48,930
- Wha?
- Oh, bad.

537
00:45:49,005 --> 00:45:50,434
- What do you want?
- Give me the document.

538
00:45:50,509 --> 00:45:52,419
Bad, bad, bad!

539
00:45:56,045 --> 00:45:57,769
- Let me go!
- Just bring her!

540
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:59,212
No! No!

541
00:46:05,998 --> 00:46:07,754
- That's...
- Go! Go!

542
00:46:17,198 --> 00:46:19,205
And just who might you be?

543
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:25,518
- Once we catch them what do we do?
- I'm working on it.

544
00:46:27,343 --> 00:46:28,685
Right turn, right turn.

545
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:33,931
Why don't you just pass me that
document? Then we can all go home.

546
00:46:45,711 --> 00:46:47,086
Oh, no.

547
00:47:01,168 --> 00:47:02,630
Skidding, skidding, skidding.

548
00:47:09,009 --> 00:47:11,147
- Oh, no!
- Holy Lord!

549
00:47:15,409 --> 00:47:19,151
- Help!
- No! If she falls, the document falls.

550
00:47:20,305 --> 00:47:22,247
Get me next to her.

551
00:47:42,354 --> 00:47:44,209
- Thank you.
- No!

552
00:47:44,274 --> 00:47:46,795
Got it. Go on.

553
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:49,356
Abigail!

554
00:47:51,026 --> 00:47:53,547
Come on. Jump.

555
00:48:01,715 --> 00:48:06,025
- We lost them.
- That's all right. This... is what we need.

556
00:48:15,924 --> 00:48:18,477
Well done, Gates. Well done.

557
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:23,373
- Are you all right?
- No! Those lunatics...

558
00:48:23,444 --> 00:48:25,899
- You're not hurt, are you?
- You are all lunatics!

559
00:48:25,972 --> 00:48:27,434
- Are you hungry?
- What?!

560
00:48:27,508 --> 00:48:28,849
Are you all right?

561
00:48:28,917 --> 00:48:32,714
Still a little on edge from being shot at,
but I'll be OK. Thanks for asking.

562
00:48:32,788 --> 00:48:36,367
Yeah, well, I'm not all right. Those men
have the Declaration of Independence!

563
00:48:36,437 --> 00:48:39,503
- She lost it?!
- They don't have it.

564
00:48:41,204 --> 00:48:44,587
See? OK?
Now could you please stop shouting?

565
00:48:45,685 --> 00:48:49,068
- Give me that!
- You're still shouting. It's starting to annoy.

566
00:48:49,589 --> 00:48:52,884
You'd do well, Dr. Chase,
to be a bit more civilized in this instance.

567
00:48:53,205 --> 00:48:55,759
If this is the real one, what did they get?

568
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:57,873
A souvenir.

569
00:48:57,941 --> 00:49:01,389
I thought it'd be a good idea to have
a duplicate. It turned out I was right.

570
00:49:01,846 --> 00:49:07,924
I actually had to pay for the souvenir and
the real one, so you owe me $35, plus tax.

571
00:49:08,406 --> 00:49:11,188
- Genius.
- Who were those men?

572
00:49:11,254 --> 00:49:13,621
Just the guys we warned you
were gonna steal the Declaration.

573
00:49:13,687 --> 00:49:15,443
And you didn't believe us.

574
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:18,030
We did the only thing we could do
to keep it safe.

575
00:49:19,158 --> 00:49:20,653
<i>Verdammt! Give me that!</i>

576
00:49:20,726 --> 00:49:22,898
You know something?
You're shouting again.

577
00:49:22,967 --> 00:49:24,876
I'm pretty sure she was swearing, too.

578
00:49:24,951 --> 00:49:27,919
Well, we probably deserve that.

579
00:49:34,167 --> 00:49:36,272
Ladies and gentlemen...

580
00:49:36,343 --> 00:49:40,533
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is
Peter Sadusky. I'm the agent in charge.

581
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:43,534
I wanna reassure you,
you are not in danger in any way.

582
00:49:43,607 --> 00:49:48,212
If we all cooperate, we'll get through this
with as little frustration as possible.

583
00:49:48,664 --> 00:49:50,573
Thank you.

584
00:49:51,768 --> 00:49:56,307
Get positive IDs. Search everyone,
including the security staff.

585
00:49:56,377 --> 00:49:58,580
If they refuse,
detain them and get warrants.

586
00:49:58,649 --> 00:50:01,551
Agent Hendricks? You have something?

587
00:50:02,264 --> 00:50:02,930
Um...

588
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:07,278
- This isn't a day for "Um..."
- We got a tip several days ago

589
00:50:07,352 --> 00:50:10,287
that someone was going to steal
the Declaration of Independence.

590
00:50:10,361 --> 00:50:13,176
Do we have a name on the tipster?

591
00:50:13,241 --> 00:50:16,689
There was no file opened.
We didn't find the information credible.

592
00:50:18,201 --> 00:50:19,860
How about now?

593
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:23,858
<i>There is not a treasure map on the back
of the Declaration of Independence.</i>

594
00:50:23,929 --> 00:50:27,704
And there's no chance
anyone can steal this either.

595
00:50:28,666 --> 00:50:31,895
I leveled with you 100 percent.
Everything I told you was the truth.

596
00:50:31,961 --> 00:50:34,034
I want that document, Mr. Brown.

597
00:50:34,458 --> 00:50:37,044
OK, my name's not Brown.
It's Gates.

598
00:50:37,114 --> 00:50:39,383
I leveled with you 98 percent.

599
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:42,036
Wait a minute, did you just say "Gates"?

600
00:50:43,034 --> 00:50:44,627
Gates?

601
00:50:44,698 --> 00:50:48,047
You're that family with the conspiracy
theory about the Founding Fathers?

602
00:50:48,123 --> 00:50:51,385
- It's not a conspiracy theory.
- Per se.

603
00:50:51,451 --> 00:50:55,128
You know what? I take it back.
You're not liars. You're insane.

604
00:50:55,195 --> 00:50:57,334
There's a copy of the Declaration
on display now?

605
00:50:57,403 --> 00:50:59,508
- Yes, we decided to...
- Leave it there.

606
00:50:59,579 --> 00:51:02,067
The guests know something happened,
but they don't know what.

607
00:51:02,139 --> 00:51:05,205
They got him with a Taser at the service
entrance. He doesn't remember a thing.

608
00:51:05,275 --> 00:51:07,315
Also, we found bullet casings.

609
00:51:07,387 --> 00:51:08,980
Did we get a description
from the other guards?

610
00:51:09,051 --> 00:51:11,921
- Which guards?
- The guards that were fired upon.

611
00:51:11,996 --> 00:51:15,957
There weren't any other guards
on patrol down here.

612
00:51:16,252 --> 00:51:18,357
So...

613
00:51:18,428 --> 00:51:21,527
who was shooting,
who were they shooting at,

614
00:51:21,596 --> 00:51:23,865
and why weren't they getting along?

615
00:51:23,932 --> 00:51:26,649
You can't seriously intend
to run chemical tests

616
00:51:26,717 --> 00:51:29,783
on the Declaration of Independence
in the back of a moving van.

617
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:31,446
We have a clean-room environment
all set up.

618
00:51:31,517 --> 00:51:34,616
EDS suits, a particulate air filtration
system, the whole shebang.

619
00:51:34,685 --> 00:51:37,140
- Really?
- We can't go back there.

620
00:51:37,213 --> 00:51:38,904
What? Why not?

621
00:51:38,973 --> 00:51:42,650
This is the guy. Dr. Herbert said
Dr. Chase introduced him as Mr. Brown.

622
00:51:42,717 --> 00:51:43,961
Not on the guestlist.

623
00:51:44,029 --> 00:51:47,990
Now, the gift-store clerk - she said
he seemed... Well, she said "flustered."

624
00:51:48,061 --> 00:51:50,908
He tried to walk out with a copy
of the Declaration of Independence

625
00:51:50,974 --> 00:51:52,883
without paying.

626
00:51:52,957 --> 00:51:54,867
He paid with a Visa.

627
00:51:54,941 --> 00:51:57,975
"Charge to Benjamin Gates."

628
00:51:58,046 --> 00:52:00,664
A credit-card slip?

629
00:52:00,734 --> 00:52:02,327
Dude, we're on the grid.

630
00:52:02,398 --> 00:52:05,148
They'll have your records from forever.
They'll have my records from forever.

631
00:52:05,214 --> 00:52:08,597
I know. I know. It's only a matter of minutes
before the FBI shows up at my front door.

632
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:10,677
What do we do?

633
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:13,368
- We need those letters.
- What letters?

634
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:17,620
You know, get off the road,
take a right.

635
00:52:17,695 --> 00:52:19,451
What letters?

636
00:52:20,287 --> 00:52:25,109
You have the original Silence Dogood
letters? Did you steal those, too?

637
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:27,191
We have scans of the originals.

638
00:52:27,264 --> 00:52:30,013
- Quiet, please.
- How'd you get scans?

639
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:33,495
Oh, I know the person
who has the originals. Now shush.

640
00:52:36,415 --> 00:52:40,638
- Why do you need them?
- She really can't shut her mouth, can she?

641
00:52:40,704 --> 00:52:44,217
I'll tell you what, look.
I will let you hold onto this

642
00:52:44,288 --> 00:52:47,005
if you'll promise to shut up, please.

643
00:52:47,071 --> 00:52:49,527
Thank you.

644
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:52,510
- Ben, you know what you have to do.
- I know what to do.

645
00:52:52,577 --> 00:52:55,195
I'm just trying to think
of anything else we could do.

646
00:52:55,264 --> 00:52:57,882
Well, not to be a, uh, nudge,

647
00:52:57,952 --> 00:53:01,815
but you do realize how many people
we have after us.

648
00:53:01,888 --> 00:53:05,052
We probably have
our own satellite by now.

649
00:53:06,176 --> 00:53:11,392
It took you all of two seconds to decide
to steal the Declaration of Independence.

650
00:53:11,457 --> 00:53:15,254
Yeah, but I didn't think I was gonna
personally have to tell my dad about it.

651
00:53:15,329 --> 00:53:17,882
Hey, not cool! Not cool!

652
00:53:17,953 --> 00:53:19,993
Let me go!

653
00:53:20,066 --> 00:53:22,237
OK. You're let go. Go, shoo.

654
00:53:22,305 --> 00:53:24,509
I'm not going. Not without the Declaration.

655
00:53:24,577 --> 00:53:27,425
<i>You're not going with the Declaration.</i>

656
00:53:27,490 --> 00:53:31,003
Yes, I am. I'm not letting it
out of my sight, so I'm going.

657
00:53:31,074 --> 00:53:34,173
Wait. You're not going with us
with the Declaration.

658
00:53:34,242 --> 00:53:37,406
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

659
00:53:38,403 --> 00:53:40,508
Look, if you wanted to leave me behind,

660
00:53:40,579 --> 00:53:43,895
you shouldn't have told me
where you were going.

661
00:53:58,947 --> 00:54:00,857
Clear.

662
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:03,743
What the...

663
00:54:05,124 --> 00:54:07,742
Now we're getting somewhere.

664
00:54:08,708 --> 00:54:12,352
<i>They're digital scans of letters
to the editor of The New England Courant.</i>

665
00:54:12,419 --> 00:54:15,038
Written 1722.

666
00:54:15,108 --> 00:54:19,298
They're all from the same person.
"Your humble servant, Silence Dogood."

667
00:54:34,244 --> 00:54:36,132
Gentlemen...

668
00:54:36,197 --> 00:54:40,223
why is this word capitalized?

669
00:54:41,221 --> 00:54:43,970
Because it's important?

670
00:54:46,054 --> 00:54:48,355
Because it's a name.

671
00:54:48,422 --> 00:54:51,291
OK, I got it.
When Ben Franklin was only 15 years old

672
00:54:51,366 --> 00:54:54,181
he secretly wrote 14 letters
to his brother's newspaper

673
00:54:54,246 --> 00:54:57,792
pretending to be a middle-aged widow
named Silence Dogood.

674
00:54:57,862 --> 00:55:00,448
These letters were written
by Benjamin Franklin.

675
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:09,412
Looks OK.

676
00:55:09,478 --> 00:55:11,999
- Park a couple of blocks away.
- Well, how long do you think we got?

677
00:55:12,071 --> 00:55:15,551
I'm gonna give them a couple of hours
at least. I hope.

678
00:55:15,623 --> 00:55:19,453
What do we do about her?
I've got some duct tape in the back.

679
00:55:19,527 --> 00:55:21,698
No, that won't be necessary.
She won't be any trouble.

680
00:55:21,767 --> 00:55:24,866
- Promise you won't be any trouble.
- I promise.

681
00:55:24,935 --> 00:55:26,790
See? She's curious.

682
00:55:30,472 --> 00:55:34,749
Here's what I got on Gates. A degree
in American History from Georgetown,

683
00:55:34,824 --> 00:55:36,963
a degree in Mechanical Engineering
at MIT,

684
00:55:37,032 --> 00:55:40,381
Navy ROTC and Naval Diving
and Salvage Training Center.

685
00:55:40,456 --> 00:55:41,983
Hm.

686
00:55:42,056 --> 00:55:44,674
What in the world did this guy
want to be when he grew up?

687
00:55:44,744 --> 00:55:46,653
We keep our focus on Gates.

688
00:55:46,728 --> 00:55:48,965
Run him to ground.

689
00:55:49,032 --> 00:55:52,610
Compile a family-and-friends list.
Closest relative first.

690
00:55:53,096 --> 00:55:55,715
I want to find out who this guy is.

691
00:56:04,075 --> 00:56:05,285
Dad.

692
00:56:07,595 --> 00:56:09,505
Where's the party?

693
00:56:10,027 --> 00:56:12,100
Uh, well, uh...

694
00:56:12,171 --> 00:56:14,592
I'm in a little trouble.

695
00:56:14,667 --> 00:56:17,188
- Is she pregnant?
- Well, if she is,

696
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:21,537
are you gonna leave the woman carrying
your grandchild standing out in the cold?

697
00:56:21,612 --> 00:56:23,914
I look pregnant?

698
00:56:28,428 --> 00:56:31,527
This better not be about
that dumb treasure.

699
00:56:36,556 --> 00:56:39,110
Well, have a seat.
Make yourselves comfortable.

700
00:56:39,181 --> 00:56:42,890
There's some pizza.
It's still warm, I think.

701
00:56:42,956 --> 00:56:44,451
Dad...

702
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:51,115
I need the Silence Dogood letters.
Yeah, it's about the treasure.

703
00:56:51,181 --> 00:56:53,123
And he dragged you two
into this nonsense?

704
00:56:53,197 --> 00:56:55,586
- Literally.
- I volunteered.

705
00:56:55,661 --> 00:56:58,760
Well, unvolunteer,
before you waste your life.

706
00:56:58,829 --> 00:57:01,731
- Knock it off, Dad.
- Sure, sure, I know, I'm the family kook.

707
00:57:01,805 --> 00:57:04,009
I have a job, a house, health insurance.

708
00:57:04,077 --> 00:57:08,071
At least I had your mother, for however
brief a time. At least I had you.

709
00:57:08,142 --> 00:57:10,313
What do you have? Him?

710
00:57:12,462 --> 00:57:15,495
Look, if you just give us the letters,
we're gone.

711
00:57:15,566 --> 00:57:17,421
You disappoint me, Ben.

712
00:57:17,486 --> 00:57:22,375
Well, maybe that's the real Gates-family
legacy. Sons who disappoint their fathers.

713
00:57:23,822 --> 00:57:26,343
Get out. Take your troubles with you.

714
00:57:31,535 --> 00:57:33,957
<i>I found the Charlotte.</i>

715
00:57:38,159 --> 00:57:40,069
<i>The Charlotte?</i>

716
00:57:40,911 --> 00:57:43,661
- You mean she was a ship?
- Yeah, she was beautiful.

717
00:57:43,727 --> 00:57:44,709
It was amazing, Dad.

718
00:57:44,784 --> 00:57:47,435
And the treasure?

719
00:57:47,504 --> 00:57:50,155
No, no. But we found another clue
that led us here.

720
00:57:50,224 --> 00:57:52,809
Yeah, and that'll lead you
to another clue.

721
00:57:52,879 --> 00:57:55,367
And that's all you'll ever find,
is another clue. Don't you get it, Ben?

722
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,815
I finally figured it out.

723
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,011
The legend says that the treasure
was buried to keep it from the British.

724
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:02,699
But what really happened
was the legend was invented,

725
00:58:02,769 --> 00:58:06,860
to keep the British occupied
searching for buried treasure.

726
00:58:06,928 --> 00:58:10,060
The treasure is a myth.

727
00:58:10,129 --> 00:58:12,398
I refuse to believe that.

728
00:58:17,393 --> 00:58:21,484
Well, you can believe what you want.
You're a grown person. What am I doing?

729
00:58:21,553 --> 00:58:24,652
Do what you want, Ben.
Do what you want.

730
00:58:26,097 --> 00:58:30,669
He's probably right. You don't even know
if there is another clue.

731
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:36,938
Well, I can think of a way where we could
find out. And we can find out right now.

732
00:58:54,355 --> 00:58:56,362
Looks like animal skin.

733
00:58:56,979 --> 00:59:00,012
- How old is it?
- At least 200 years.

734
00:59:00,082 --> 00:59:03,661
- Really? You sure?
- Pretty darn.

735
00:59:03,731 --> 00:59:06,120
Now if this thing's in invisible ink,
how do we look at it?

736
00:59:06,195 --> 00:59:07,439
Throw it in the oven.

737
00:59:07,507 --> 00:59:09,034
- No.
- Uh-uh.

738
00:59:09,107 --> 00:59:11,661
Ferrous sulfate inks can only
be brought out with heat.

739
00:59:11,732 --> 00:59:14,798
- Yes, but this...
- It's very old.

740
00:59:14,868 --> 00:59:20,335
This is very old, and we can't
risk compromising the map.

741
00:59:20,404 --> 00:59:21,581
You need a reagent.

742
00:59:21,651 --> 00:59:24,237
Dad, it's really late.
Why don't you get some rest?

743
00:59:24,308 --> 00:59:26,697
I'm fine.

744
00:59:26,772 --> 00:59:28,528
Lemons.

745
00:59:34,868 --> 00:59:37,105
- You can't do that.
- But it has to be done.

746
00:59:37,172 --> 00:59:41,296
Then someone who is trained to handle
antique documents is gonna do it.

747
00:59:42,228 --> 00:59:44,083
OK.

748
00:59:45,845 --> 00:59:47,438
OK.

749
00:59:48,565 --> 00:59:51,500
Now, uh, if there is a secret message,

750
00:59:51,573 --> 00:59:56,658
it'll probably be marked by a symbol
in the upper right-hand corner.

751
00:59:56,725 --> 00:59:58,285
That's right.

752
01:00:01,910 --> 01:00:04,212
I am so getting fired for this.

753
01:00:34,359 --> 01:00:37,042
I told you. You need heat.

754
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:55,953
See?

755
01:00:58,552 --> 01:01:00,560
- We need more juice.
- We need more heat.

756
01:01:14,521 --> 01:01:16,823
That's not a map.

757
01:01:16,889 --> 01:01:19,889
- Is it?
- More clues. What a surprise.

758
01:01:19,961 --> 01:01:21,587
Are those latitudes and longitudes?

759
01:01:21,657 --> 01:01:24,112
That's why we need
the Silence Dogood letters.

760
01:01:24,185 --> 01:01:27,120
- That's the key?
- Yeah. "The key in Silence undetected."

761
01:01:27,194 --> 01:01:28,754
Dad, can we have the letters now?

762
01:01:28,826 --> 01:01:33,103
Will somebody please explain to me
what these magic numbers are?

763
01:01:33,177 --> 01:01:35,544
- It's an Ottendorf cipher.
- That's right.

764
01:01:35,610 --> 01:01:37,366
Oh, OK.

765
01:01:37,434 --> 01:01:40,249
- What's an Ottendorf cipher?
- They're just codes.

766
01:01:40,314 --> 01:01:44,471
Each of these three numbers
corresponds to a word in a key.

767
01:01:44,539 --> 01:01:47,256
Usually a random book
or a newspaper article.

768
01:01:47,322 --> 01:01:49,394
In this case,
the Silence Dogood letters.

769
01:01:49,466 --> 01:01:51,768
So it's like the page number
of the key text,

770
01:01:51,834 --> 01:01:55,031
the line on the page,
and the letter in that line.

771
01:01:55,099 --> 01:01:57,587
So, Dad, where are the letters?

772
01:01:57,659 --> 01:02:02,481
You know, it's just by sheer happenstance
that his grandfather...

773
01:02:02,555 --> 01:02:03,700
- Dad.
...even found them.

774
01:02:03,771 --> 01:02:05,975
They were in an antique desk
from the press room...

775
01:02:06,043 --> 01:02:07,636
<i>- Dad.
...of The New England Courant.</i>

776
01:02:07,707 --> 01:02:10,642
- That's a newspaper.
- Dad, where are the letters?

777
01:02:10,716 --> 01:02:13,367
I don't have them, son.

778
01:02:13,436 --> 01:02:16,087
- What?
- I don't have them.

779
01:02:22,684 --> 01:02:23,993
Where are they?

780
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:27,409
I donated them to the Franklin Institute
in Philadelphia.

781
01:02:27,997 --> 01:02:29,906
Time to go.

782
01:02:30,908 --> 01:02:35,382
I still can't believe it. All this time
no one knew what was on the back.

783
01:02:35,453 --> 01:02:36,860
- The back of what?
- Whoa!

784
01:02:36,925 --> 01:02:38,965
No!

785
01:02:39,037 --> 01:02:41,426
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- I know.

786
01:02:41,501 --> 01:02:44,021
Oh, my God. What have you done?
This is... this is the...

787
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:46,744
- I know!
- This is the Declaration of Independence.

788
01:02:46,813 --> 01:02:49,847
Yes. And it's very delicate.

789
01:02:49,917 --> 01:02:52,023
You stole it?

790
01:02:52,094 --> 01:02:57,244
Dad, I can explain, but I don't have time.
It was necessary. And you saw the cipher.

791
01:02:57,309 --> 01:02:59,927
And that will lead to another clue,
and that will lead to another clue!

792
01:02:59,997 --> 01:03:03,227
There is no treasure.
I wasted 20 years of my life.

793
01:03:03,294 --> 01:03:06,044
And now you've destroyed yours.

794
01:03:06,846 --> 01:03:08,919
And you pulled me into all this.

795
01:03:09,694 --> 01:03:12,411
Well, we can't have that.

796
01:03:16,862 --> 01:03:19,350
Come in!

797
01:03:19,423 --> 01:03:21,332
I'm in here.

798
01:03:22,270 --> 01:03:24,180
FBI, right?

799
01:03:27,903 --> 01:03:30,140
You gonna untie me?

800
01:03:32,735 --> 01:03:35,102
And you have no idea where he's going?

801
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:39,096
- Well, wouldn't I have told you if I did?
- Would you?

802
01:03:39,167 --> 01:03:41,207
He tied me to a chair.

803
01:03:41,279 --> 01:03:45,174
The garage is empty, but there's a Cadillac
De Ville registered to Patrick Gates.

804
01:03:45,248 --> 01:03:47,223
And he stole my car.

805
01:03:47,648 --> 01:03:51,161
Don't worry, Mr. Gates, we'll find your car.
And your son.

806
01:03:53,664 --> 01:03:55,933
Your dad's got a sweet ride.

807
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,750
I think we should change clothes.

808
01:03:58,816 --> 01:04:01,238
We look kind of conspicuous,
don't you think?

809
01:04:01,313 --> 01:04:04,182
I'd love to go shopping, too,
but we have no money.

810
01:04:04,256 --> 01:04:06,231
Here, I took this from his house.

811
01:04:06,305 --> 01:04:09,818
He usually tucks a few hundred dollars
somewhere between those pages.

812
01:04:09,889 --> 01:04:13,948
<i>- Common Sense. How appropriate.
- When are we gonna get there?</i>

813
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:17,465
I'm hungry. This car smells weird.

814
01:05:00,099 --> 01:05:02,139
Excuse me.

815
01:05:02,211 --> 01:05:05,026
Excuse me. Oops, sorry, sir. Excuse me.

816
01:05:05,091 --> 01:05:07,066
That's OK.

817
01:05:13,252 --> 01:05:15,259
S-S-A-N-D.

818
01:05:15,332 --> 01:05:17,918
OK. Huh.

819
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:20,925
You're sure this is right?

820
01:05:22,308 --> 01:05:23,618
OK.

821
01:05:23,685 --> 01:05:25,441
S-S-A...

822
01:05:26,436 --> 01:05:28,160
No, N.

823
01:05:28,229 --> 01:05:31,328
- That is an N.
- It doesn't look like an N.

824
01:05:33,188 --> 01:05:36,385
You know what? Here. Last one. OK?

825
01:05:37,573 --> 01:05:39,745
- One more dollar.
- Thank you.

826
01:05:40,261 --> 01:05:42,333
Go get the last four letters.

827
01:05:42,405 --> 01:05:44,739
Go get 'em, chief. Come on.

828
01:06:02,086 --> 01:06:06,342
OK. "The vision to see the treasured past

829
01:06:06,406 --> 01:06:12,604
comes as the timely shadow crosses
in front of the house of pass and..."

830
01:06:12,679 --> 01:06:15,199
"Pass and..." what?

831
01:06:28,135 --> 01:06:30,688
"Pass and..."

832
01:06:55,656 --> 01:06:58,078
What's going on?

833
01:07:00,104 --> 01:07:01,959
- I'm not sure.
- What's up?

834
01:07:04,392 --> 01:07:07,688
So you show up at your father's
door and say you're in trouble

835
01:07:07,753 --> 01:07:11,463
and the first thing he assumes
is I'm pregnant.

836
01:07:11,529 --> 01:07:13,831
Is there a question in there?

837
01:07:13,897 --> 01:07:16,352
I think there's an interesting story
in there.

838
01:07:16,425 --> 01:07:20,320
Well, my father thinks I've been
a little too cavalier in my personal life.

839
01:07:20,394 --> 01:07:22,979
- I see.
- Let me ask you something.

840
01:07:23,049 --> 01:07:25,864
Have you ever told someone -
not a relative - "I love you?"

841
01:07:25,930 --> 01:07:28,068
Yes.

842
01:07:28,137 --> 01:07:30,690
More than one someone?

843
01:07:31,530 --> 01:07:32,937
Yes.

844
01:07:33,002 --> 01:07:34,824
Oh. Well, then my father would say

845
01:07:34,890 --> 01:07:38,152
you've been a little too cavalier
in your personal life, too.

846
01:07:38,218 --> 01:07:41,535
So you get your sense of absolute certainty
from him, do you?

847
01:07:41,611 --> 01:07:43,465
Well, I'm sure I don't know
what you mean.

848
01:07:43,531 --> 01:07:48,103
Well, you're certain the treasure is real,
despite what anyone else thinks.

849
01:07:48,171 --> 01:07:49,600
No, but I hope it's real.

850
01:07:49,675 --> 01:07:54,017
I mean, I've dreamt it's real
since my grandfather told me about it.

851
01:07:54,091 --> 01:07:57,223
But I want to hold it.
I feel like I'm so close, I can taste it.

852
01:07:57,292 --> 01:08:01,831
But I just... I just want to know it's not just
something in my head or in my heart.

853
01:08:05,612 --> 01:08:08,427
People don't really talk that way, you know.

854
01:08:08,492 --> 01:08:11,972
I know. But they think that way.

855
01:08:17,836 --> 01:08:18,730
Hey.

856
01:08:18,796 --> 01:08:20,706
- Did you get it? Riley?
- Oh, I got it.

857
01:08:20,781 --> 01:08:24,392
"The vision to see
the treasured past comes

858
01:08:24,461 --> 01:08:29,611
as the timely shadow crosses
in front of the house of Pass and Stow."

859
01:08:29,677 --> 01:08:32,394
Now, "Pass and Stow," of course,
referring to...

860
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:35,210
- The Liberty Bell.
- Why do you have to do that?

861
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:37,666
Well, John Pass and John Stow
cast the bell.

862
01:08:37,741 --> 01:08:40,840
OK. Well, then, what does
the rest of this mean?

863
01:08:40,909 --> 01:08:45,448
Wait..."The vision to see the treasured
past" must refer to a way to read the map.

864
01:08:45,517 --> 01:08:46,979
Well, I thought the cipher was the map.

865
01:08:47,054 --> 01:08:49,803
No, the cipher was a way
to find the way to read the map.

866
01:08:49,870 --> 01:08:51,463
And the way to read the map can be found

867
01:08:51,534 --> 01:08:55,909
where the "timely shadow" crosses
in front of the Liberty Bell.

868
01:08:55,982 --> 01:08:59,113
Crosses in front of the "house"
of the Liberty Bell. Independence Hall.

869
01:08:59,182 --> 01:09:02,531
Right, so "timely shadow" -
it's a specific time.

870
01:09:03,022 --> 01:09:05,030
- Right.
- Uh, what time?

871
01:09:05,102 --> 01:09:07,785
What time? What time?

872
01:09:08,431 --> 01:09:11,530
Wait a minute, wait.
You're gonna love this.

873
01:09:11,599 --> 01:09:15,079
Excuse me, can I see one of those
hundred-dollar bills I paid you with?

874
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:16,678
No.

875
01:09:17,167 --> 01:09:20,484
Oh. Well, uh, here,
I have this diver's watch.

876
01:09:20,559 --> 01:09:23,210
It's called a Submariner. I dive with it.
It's actually quite valuable.

877
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:25,287
- You can use it as collateral.
- Whatever.

878
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:26,821
Thank you.

879
01:09:26,895 --> 01:09:29,513
On the back of a hundred-dollar bill
is an etching of Independence Hall

880
01:09:29,583 --> 01:09:31,144
- based on a painting done in...
- Hello.

881
01:09:31,216 --> 01:09:33,420
Thank you.
...in the 1780s, who...

882
01:09:33,488 --> 01:09:36,804
The artist was actually a friend
of Benjamin Franklin's. It's wonderful.

883
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,407
- Fascinating.
- Hold this.

884
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:40,422
OK.

885
01:09:40,879 --> 01:09:42,919
I'm not going anywhere.

886
01:09:43,408 --> 01:09:46,856
Now, I think that if we look
at this clock tower...

887
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:50,506
...we may find the specific time.

888
01:09:53,201 --> 01:09:56,267
- What do you see?
- 2:22.

889
01:09:56,337 --> 01:09:59,599
- What time is it now?
- Almost three.

890
01:10:00,784 --> 01:10:03,981
- We missed it.
- No, we didn't.

891
01:10:04,049 --> 01:10:06,766
We didn't miss it because... uh...

892
01:10:06,833 --> 01:10:10,957
You don't know this? I-I know something
about history that you don't know.

893
01:10:11,025 --> 01:10:12,968
I'd be very excited to learn about it, Riley.

894
01:10:13,041 --> 01:10:16,238
Well, hold on one second, let me just...
let me just take in this moment.

895
01:10:16,305 --> 01:10:18,727
This is... this is cool.

896
01:10:18,802 --> 01:10:22,446
Is this how you feel all the time? Because,
you know... Except for now, of course.

897
01:10:22,513 --> 01:10:24,521
- Riley!
- All right.

898
01:10:24,594 --> 01:10:29,711
What I know is that daylight savings
wasn't established until World War I.

899
01:10:29,778 --> 01:10:35,180
If it's 3pm now, OK, that means
in 1776, it would be 2pm.

900
01:10:35,250 --> 01:10:37,160
- Let's go.
- Riley, you're a genius.

901
01:10:37,234 --> 01:10:39,406
Yeah.

902
01:10:39,475 --> 01:10:42,955
Do you actually know who the first person
to suggest daylight savings was?

903
01:10:43,026 --> 01:10:45,710
- Benjamin Franklin.
- Benjamin Franklin.

904
01:10:46,291 --> 01:10:48,298
Is this real?

905
01:10:48,371 --> 01:10:50,575
Just tell me what you told my friend.

906
01:10:50,643 --> 01:10:54,222
Just a bunch of letters.
I can't remember.

907
01:10:54,292 --> 01:10:58,602
Can you remember which ones
you were gonna tell him next?

908
01:10:58,676 --> 01:11:01,327
Yeah, here. S-T-O-W.

909
01:11:09,012 --> 01:11:13,202
Top results: Liberty Bell
and Independence Hall.

910
01:11:16,436 --> 01:11:19,851
Imagine its impact
back in the 18th century.

911
01:11:19,924 --> 01:11:23,853
It could have been seen for miles around,
which was exactly its purpose,

912
01:11:23,924 --> 01:11:25,867
because it served as a beacon, as it were,

913
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:28,658
for people to collect and hear...

914
01:11:42,773 --> 01:11:43,722
Good stuff.

915
01:11:43,798 --> 01:11:47,246
It was in 1846,
on George Washington's birthday,

916
01:11:47,317 --> 01:11:50,318
that the final expansion
of the crack occurred,

917
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:52,756
retiring the Liberty Bell permanently.

918
01:11:52,822 --> 01:11:54,927
Eventually, it was moved from its place

919
01:11:54,998 --> 01:11:57,332
in Independence Hall steeple
and given its own...

920
01:11:57,398 --> 01:11:59,919
- Idiot.
- Who?

921
01:11:59,990 --> 01:12:01,452
- Me.
- What?

922
01:12:01,526 --> 01:12:04,461
It's not here. It's there.

923
01:12:05,302 --> 01:12:07,212
Come on.

924
01:12:15,351 --> 01:12:17,620
- What bell is this?
- It's the Centennial Bell.

925
01:12:17,687 --> 01:12:21,036
It replaced the Liberty Bell in 1876.

926
01:12:28,376 --> 01:12:30,351
There it is.

927
01:12:30,424 --> 01:12:33,653
All right. I'm gonna go down there,
and you meet me in the signing room.

928
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:35,989
- OK? All right.
- OK.

929
01:12:36,056 --> 01:12:38,325
All right, let's go.

930
01:12:38,392 --> 01:12:41,588
3:22. My idea.

931
01:13:46,491 --> 01:13:48,346
Hey. What'd you score?

932
01:13:48,412 --> 01:13:49,841
I found this.

933
01:13:49,915 --> 01:13:52,337
Some kind of ocular device.

934
01:13:52,411 --> 01:13:55,706
"The vision to see the treasured past."
Let me take this.

935
01:13:55,772 --> 01:13:59,350
Aw, they're like early American
X-ray specs.

936
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:02,006
Benjamin Franklin invented
something like these.

937
01:14:02,076 --> 01:14:03,385
Uh...

938
01:14:03,452 --> 01:14:05,656
I think he invented these.

939
01:14:05,724 --> 01:14:07,666
So, what do we do with them?

940
01:14:08,188 --> 01:14:10,195
We look through it.

941
01:14:12,988 --> 01:14:15,836
- Here, help me.
- Uh-huh.

942
01:14:16,284 --> 01:14:18,805
- Careful.
- You think?

943
01:14:23,388 --> 01:14:24,566
Whoo...

944
01:14:24,637 --> 01:14:28,915
- What?
- It's just that the last time this was here

945
01:14:28,989 --> 01:14:31,226
it was being signed.

946
01:14:33,725 --> 01:14:37,238
- Ben, there's another tour coming.
- Turn it over.

947
01:14:37,309 --> 01:14:39,863
- Careful.
- Spectacles.

948
01:14:51,646 --> 01:14:53,533
What do you see?

949
01:14:56,254 --> 01:14:58,775
What is it? Is it a treasure map?

950
01:14:58,847 --> 01:15:03,582
It says, "Heere at the wall,"
spelled with two E's.

951
01:15:03,647 --> 01:15:05,556
Take a look.

952
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:08,222
Ah.

953
01:15:09,407 --> 01:15:10,968
Wow.

954
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:15,479
Why can't they just say, "Go to this place,
and here's the treasure, spend it wisely?"

955
01:15:15,551 --> 01:15:17,885
Oh, no.

956
01:15:18,559 --> 01:15:20,861
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

957
01:15:21,823 --> 01:15:23,252
How'd they find us?

958
01:15:23,327 --> 01:15:26,743
Well, Ian has nearly unlimited resources.
And he's smart.

959
01:15:26,815 --> 01:15:29,369
I don't think we can get out
of here without being spotted.

960
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:32,254
Well, we don't want them to have
the Declaration, or the glasses.

961
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,840
But we especially don't want them
to have them both together.

962
01:15:34,912 --> 01:15:37,760
- So what do we do?
- We separate the lock from the key.

963
01:15:37,824 --> 01:15:39,799
- We're splitting up.
- Good idea.

964
01:15:39,872 --> 01:15:40,985
Really?

965
01:15:41,056 --> 01:15:43,161
I'll take this.

966
01:15:43,232 --> 01:15:46,778
And those. You keep that. Meet me at the
car and call me if you have any problems.

967
01:15:46,849 --> 01:15:49,696
Like if we get caught and killed?

968
01:15:49,761 --> 01:15:53,176
Yeah. That would be a big problem.
Take care of her.

969
01:15:53,249 --> 01:15:55,485
- I will.
- I will.

970
01:16:03,713 --> 01:16:05,372
We're on him.

971
01:16:07,810 --> 01:16:09,501
There he is.

972
01:16:13,441 --> 01:16:15,743
- Let's walk this way.
- Wait up.

973
01:16:16,450 --> 01:16:19,712
- Shaw, look. There's the others.
- I got it.

974
01:16:21,090 --> 01:16:25,979
Viktor, meet me at Fifth and Chestnut. Fifth
and Chestnut. They're heading your way.

975
01:16:50,116 --> 01:16:51,643
- Look out! Look out!
- Riley!

976
01:16:51,716 --> 01:16:54,530
- There they are! Move!
- Move!

977
01:16:55,331 --> 01:16:57,917
- Time to run.
- Keep up, Viktor! Move. Come on.

978
01:17:04,516 --> 01:17:06,851
In here.

979
01:17:11,589 --> 01:17:13,694
- Come on.
- Follow me.

980
01:17:18,757 --> 01:17:20,732
That way.

981
01:17:27,269 --> 01:17:30,400
If you're not a steak,
you don't belong here.

982
01:17:30,853 --> 01:17:34,017
I'm just trying to hide
from my ex-husband.

983
01:17:34,085 --> 01:17:36,769
- Who, baldy?
- Yes.

984
01:17:37,381 --> 01:17:39,454
Honey, stay as long as you like.

985
01:17:39,526 --> 01:17:41,730
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

986
01:17:41,798 --> 01:17:43,708
You want something?

987
01:17:49,478 --> 01:17:52,064
- Do you want something?
- Shut up.

988
01:17:54,726 --> 01:17:56,701
I see why you left him.

989
01:18:02,022 --> 01:18:03,964
Go around. Go around.

990
01:18:09,383 --> 01:18:11,041
Gates!

991
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:35,102
Ow!

992
01:18:35,944 --> 01:18:38,181
Aw, come on!

993
01:18:45,384 --> 01:18:47,239
Shh-shh-shh.

994
01:18:47,304 --> 01:18:49,694
- Where were you?
- Hiding.

995
01:18:49,768 --> 01:18:51,907
Come on. Let's go, let's go.

996
01:18:56,809 --> 01:18:59,711
Ian. Ian, I've got 'em.
They're heading toward City Hall.

997
01:18:59,785 --> 01:19:02,305
- OK, I'm on my way.
- Out of the way!

998
01:19:02,377 --> 01:19:04,265
Ow!

999
01:19:29,290 --> 01:19:30,567
Whoa!

1000
01:19:30,635 --> 01:19:32,293
They're headed for the breezeway
on the north side.

1001
01:19:32,363 --> 01:19:33,224
I'll be right there.

1002
01:19:42,316 --> 01:19:44,225
Hey, Gates!

1003
01:19:49,836 --> 01:19:53,098
Enough, man! Give me the document.

1004
01:19:54,156 --> 01:19:56,294
All right, Phil.

1005
01:20:12,429 --> 01:20:15,299
Watch out! Get out of my way!

1006
01:20:18,829 --> 01:20:20,618
Watch it!

1007
01:21:01,039 --> 01:21:03,144
Leave them! Let 'em go.

1008
01:21:06,031 --> 01:21:07,558
We've got it.

1009
01:21:08,368 --> 01:21:12,012
- FBI. Have you seen this guy?
- No.

1010
01:21:12,815 --> 01:21:14,538
Nope, I haven't seen him.

1011
01:21:14,607 --> 01:21:17,477
Ted. Philadelphia police
found Gates's car.

1012
01:21:17,552 --> 01:21:19,854
It's close.
We got surveillance there now.

1013
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:22,571
Let's go. Tell the boss
we got the car.

1014
01:21:24,943 --> 01:21:26,470
<i>- What?
- We lost it.</i>

1015
01:21:26,544 --> 01:21:30,057
<i>- What?
- We lost the Declaration. Ian took it.</i>

1016
01:21:32,144 --> 01:21:35,144
Yeah, uh, OK. You all right?
You both all right?

1017
01:21:35,216 --> 01:21:37,256
Yeah, yeah, we're all right.

1018
01:21:37,328 --> 01:21:40,427
<i>- Ben, I'm sorry.
- We'll be fine.</i>

1019
01:21:40,497 --> 01:21:42,886
Meet me at the car.

1020
01:21:48,561 --> 01:21:50,219
Suspect has arrived.

1021
01:21:53,586 --> 01:21:55,473
Hello, Mr. Gates.

1022
01:21:56,689 --> 01:21:59,788
Mr. Gates, face your father's car and
put your hands behind your back, please.

1023
01:21:59,857 --> 01:22:03,272
- We got one in custody.
- Gates, you're a hard man to find.

1024
01:22:03,345 --> 01:22:04,872
Could you please be careful?

1025
01:22:18,578 --> 01:22:21,927
Riley, do you know
how to get in touch with Ian?

1026
01:22:23,891 --> 01:22:25,679
Excuse me?

1027
01:22:29,971 --> 01:22:31,084
That's some story.

1028
01:22:31,155 --> 01:22:34,701
Well, it's the same story I tried to tell you
guys before the Declaration was stolen.

1029
01:22:34,771 --> 01:22:38,449
- By you.
- No, by Ian. I stole it to stop him.

1030
01:22:38,515 --> 01:22:41,614
I did it alone.
Dr. Chase was not involved.

1031
01:22:42,196 --> 01:22:45,392
And Ian still ended up with
the Declaration of Independence.

1032
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:47,402
Because of you.

1033
01:22:48,052 --> 01:22:50,867
So here's your options.

1034
01:22:50,932 --> 01:22:54,827
Door number one,
you go to prison for a very long time.

1035
01:22:55,316 --> 01:23:00,172
Door number two, we are going to get back
the Declaration of Independence,

1036
01:23:00,244 --> 01:23:04,848
you help us find it, and you still
go to prison for a very long time,

1037
01:23:04,916 --> 01:23:07,283
but you feel better inside.

1038
01:23:07,349 --> 01:23:10,611
Is there a door that doesn't lead to prison?

1039
01:23:11,349 --> 01:23:14,480
- Someone's got to go to prison, Ben.
- Yeah.

1040
01:23:16,789 --> 01:23:18,960
So what are these for?

1041
01:23:19,029 --> 01:23:20,939
It's a way to read the map.

1042
01:23:21,013 --> 01:23:22,671
Right.

1043
01:23:22,741 --> 01:23:24,235
Knights Templar.

1044
01:23:24,309 --> 01:23:25,684
Freemasons.

1045
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:28,171
Invisible treasure map.

1046
01:23:28,726 --> 01:23:32,370
- So what'd it say?
- "Heere at the wall."

1047
01:23:32,437 --> 01:23:34,859
Nothing else.

1048
01:23:34,934 --> 01:23:37,323
It's just another clue.

1049
01:23:37,398 --> 01:23:39,886
It looks like Ian Howe
could be a false identity.

1050
01:23:39,958 --> 01:23:42,511
Follow up with ATF and INS.

1051
01:23:43,062 --> 01:23:45,397
There's more to it.

1052
01:23:45,462 --> 01:23:47,883
- Standard tap procedure.
- Let's check the signal, folks.

1053
01:23:47,958 --> 01:23:50,195
- Lock it in.
- Are we set?

1054
01:23:50,262 --> 01:23:53,296
- Checking source.
- Unknown number.

1055
01:23:56,278 --> 01:23:57,489
Yes.

1056
01:23:57,559 --> 01:24:00,112
<i> Hello. Ben. How are you?</i>

1057
01:24:00,183 --> 01:24:03,499
<i>- Um, chained to a desk.
- Sorry to hear that.</i>

1058
01:24:03,991 --> 01:24:06,544
<i>I want you to meet me on the flight deck
of the USS Intrepid.</i>

1059
01:24:06,615 --> 01:24:08,590
<i>- You know where that is?
- New York.</i>

1060
01:24:09,015 --> 01:24:10,990
<i>Meet me there at ten o'clock
tomorrow morning.</i>

1061
01:24:11,064 --> 01:24:14,413
And bring those glasses
you found at Independence Hall.

1062
01:24:14,487 --> 01:24:16,757
<i>Yeah. I know about the glasses.</i>

1063
01:24:17,688 --> 01:24:21,463
We can take a look at the Declaration,
and then you can be on your way.

1064
01:24:21,528 --> 01:24:23,252
And I'm supposed to believe that.

1065
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:25,938
<i>I told you from the start.
I only wanted to borrow it.</i>

1066
01:24:26,392 --> 01:24:28,247
You can have it. And the glasses.

1067
01:24:28,312 --> 01:24:31,989
<i>I'll even throw in the pipe
from the Charlotte.</i>

1068
01:24:32,056 --> 01:24:33,714
I'll be there.

1069
01:24:33,784 --> 01:24:36,686
<i>And tell the FBI agents
listening in on this call</i>

1070
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:40,535
<i>if they want the Declaration back.
And not just a box of confetti.</i>

1071
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:42,902
Then you'll come alone.

1072
01:24:55,386 --> 01:24:58,069
<i>- Take positions.
- Perimeter looks normal.</i>

1073
01:24:58,137 --> 01:25:01,367
<i>- Can I get a status report?
- Crow's nest in position. Port side is quiet.</i>

1074
01:25:01,434 --> 01:25:02,863
<i> Copy that.</i>

1075
01:25:12,571 --> 01:25:16,051
- Gates is on the flight deck.
- Eyes on Gates.

1076
01:25:16,122 --> 01:25:19,221
<i>- Do not lose sight of primary mark.
- Brian. You're clear with N YPD.</i>

1077
01:25:19,291 --> 01:25:21,713
- I have a visual.
- Gates.

1078
01:25:21,786 --> 01:25:22,997
<i>Stay with the program.</i>

1079
01:25:23,067 --> 01:25:26,231
I hope your agents are all under four feet
tall and wearing little scarves.

1080
01:25:26,299 --> 01:25:28,154
Otherwise Ian's gonna know they're here.

1081
01:25:28,219 --> 01:25:30,936
<i>As soon as he shows you the Declaration.
We'll move in.</i>

1082
01:25:31,003 --> 01:25:33,524
Don't try anything.
Just let us handle it.

1083
01:25:33,595 --> 01:25:37,556
You know, Agent Sadusky,
something I've noticed about fishing:

1084
01:25:37,628 --> 01:25:40,311
It never works out so well for the bait.

1085
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:51,322
Sir, we've got some traffic incoming.
Looks like a sightseeing helicopter.

1086
01:25:51,388 --> 01:25:53,657
Unit two,
get an eyeball on that chopper.

1087
01:25:53,724 --> 01:25:57,073
Agent Michaels, get FAA flight plans
and authorization records on that craft.

1088
01:25:57,148 --> 01:26:00,345
If that's not Mr. Howe,
I want to know who it is.

1089
01:26:00,413 --> 01:26:04,471
- I got him. He's coming from the north.
- Gates. Are you with me?

1090
01:26:04,541 --> 01:26:08,218
Well, I'm sure not against you,
if that's what you're asking.

1091
01:26:30,462 --> 01:26:32,796
We've got some interference
on Gates's mike, sir.

1092
01:26:32,862 --> 01:26:34,007
This I know.

1093
01:26:35,422 --> 01:26:37,844
Hello, Ben.

1094
01:26:37,918 --> 01:26:41,267
Thomas Edison needed only one way
to make a light bulb.

1095
01:26:41,343 --> 01:26:43,644
Sound familiar?

1096
01:26:45,598 --> 01:26:47,703
<i>- Keep sightlines clear.
- What's the devil's going on?</i>

1097
01:26:47,774 --> 01:26:49,400
<i>There's a lot of commotion.
We can't see Gates.</i>

1098
01:26:49,471 --> 01:26:54,075
Go to the starboard observation point
behind the F-16 and here's what you do.

1099
01:26:55,519 --> 01:26:56,893
Gates? Gates?

1100
01:26:56,959 --> 01:27:00,440
<i> Air Tour helicopter.
You are in controlled airspace.</i>

1101
01:27:00,511 --> 01:27:02,005
<i>Vacate immediately.</i>

1102
01:27:02,079 --> 01:27:03,606
<i> Who's got Gates?</i>

1103
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:05,981
<i>- All agents. Report in.
- I can't see anything.</i>

1104
01:27:06,048 --> 01:27:09,212
<i>- Did Gates speak to anybody?
- Target is moving.</i>

1105
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:13,109
<i>- He's heading towards the stern.
- I've got him. He's coming this way.</i>

1106
01:27:13,184 --> 01:27:15,191
Anyone got a view of our friend Ian Howe?

1107
01:27:15,263 --> 01:27:17,086
Ian Howe is not at the stern, sir.

1108
01:27:17,152 --> 01:27:20,283
<i>Then why is he heading there?</i>

1109
01:27:20,352 --> 01:27:23,386
<i>He's at the observation deck.</i>

1110
01:27:23,456 --> 01:27:24,471
Sadusky.

1111
01:27:24,896 --> 01:27:26,751
<i>I'm still not against you.</i>

1112
01:27:26,817 --> 01:27:30,526
But I found door number three.
And I'm taking it.

1113
01:27:30,592 --> 01:27:32,535
- What's he talking about?
- Move in!

1114
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:34,747
<i>Move in! Move in on Gates!</i>

1115
01:27:44,353 --> 01:27:45,368
<i>Divers are a go.</i>

1116
01:27:45,441 --> 01:27:47,994
- Snipers, go to action zebra.
- All teams, move in. Pursue at own risk.

1117
01:27:48,065 --> 01:27:50,716
<i>- I repeat. Pursue at own risk.
- You first.</i>

1118
01:27:50,785 --> 01:27:53,306
Holy mackerel. He set us up.

1119
01:28:14,754 --> 01:28:18,366
<i> Agent Dawes. Do you have
a visual? Can you see Gates in the water?</i>

1120
01:28:18,434 --> 01:28:21,020
Sir, it's the Hudson. Nothing is visible.

1121
01:28:21,795 --> 01:28:23,705
Smart fish.

1122
01:28:41,411 --> 01:28:44,794
Hello, Ben. Welcome to New Jersey.

1123
01:28:45,796 --> 01:28:48,218
- What'd you do with Abigail and Riley?
- Hope these fit.

1124
01:28:48,292 --> 01:28:49,753
We had to guess your sizes.

1125
01:28:49,828 --> 01:28:51,803
I said, what'd you do
with Abigail and Riley?

1126
01:28:51,876 --> 01:28:54,015
He's the only one who could've
told you that line about Edison.

1127
01:28:54,085 --> 01:28:55,994
Did you bring the glasses?

1128
01:28:56,068 --> 01:28:57,824
I don't know.
Tell me what's happening here.

1129
01:28:57,892 --> 01:29:00,413
Ask your girlfriend.

1130
01:29:00,485 --> 01:29:02,819
She's the one calling all the shots now.

1131
01:29:02,884 --> 01:29:05,535
She won't shut up.

1132
01:29:08,677 --> 01:29:11,066
Yeah, hello.

1133
01:29:11,141 --> 01:29:13,312
It's for you.

1134
01:29:13,765 --> 01:29:17,540
- Hello.
- Hi, sweetie. How's your day going?

1135
01:29:17,605 --> 01:29:19,613
<i>Uh. Interesting. Dear.</i>

1136
01:29:19,685 --> 01:29:22,052
So, what, you working with Ian now?

1137
01:29:22,630 --> 01:29:26,492
It turns out helping someone escape
from FBI custody is a criminal act.

1138
01:29:26,566 --> 01:29:27,973
And he's the only criminal we knew.

1139
01:29:28,038 --> 01:29:30,886
<i>- So we called him and made a deal.
- Well, you're, um...</i>

1140
01:29:32,358 --> 01:29:34,911
You're... you're... you're all right, yeah?
I mean you're safe?

1141
01:29:34,982 --> 01:29:37,186
Yeah, we both are.

1142
01:29:37,254 --> 01:29:40,570
Riley's right here, doing
something clever with a computer.

1143
01:29:40,646 --> 01:29:42,654
I'm tracking him through the... Hey!

1144
01:29:42,726 --> 01:29:45,028
I'm tracking you through the GPS
in Shaw's phone.

1145
01:29:45,094 --> 01:29:48,226
They take a turn anywhere we don't want,
we'll know it. So don't worry.

1146
01:29:48,295 --> 01:29:53,565
If Ian tries to double-cross us, we can call
the FBI and tell them right where you are.

1147
01:29:53,639 --> 01:29:56,322
<i>- And where to find Ian.
- And where is that?</i>

1148
01:29:56,392 --> 01:29:58,563
Right across the street
from where we're hiding,

1149
01:29:58,631 --> 01:30:00,518
at the intersection
of Wall Street and Broadway.

1150
01:30:01,063 --> 01:30:03,365
Well, you figured out the clue.

1151
01:30:03,431 --> 01:30:06,530
<i>Simple. "Heere at the wall."
Wall Street and Broadway.</i>

1152
01:30:09,672 --> 01:30:11,679
Ben, there is a catch.

1153
01:30:11,752 --> 01:30:14,654
We made Ian believe
he could have the treasure.

1154
01:30:14,728 --> 01:30:16,638
It was the only way
we could get this far.

1155
01:30:16,712 --> 01:30:18,850
He's here.

1156
01:30:26,024 --> 01:30:27,934
Here we go.

1157
01:30:32,393 --> 01:30:33,375
Ben.

1158
01:30:33,449 --> 01:30:38,370
You all right? No broken bones?
A jump like that could kill a man.

1159
01:30:38,441 --> 01:30:41,092
Naw, it was cool.
You should try it sometime.

1160
01:30:43,530 --> 01:30:47,174
The Declaration of Independence.
And the meerschaum pipe.

1161
01:30:47,689 --> 01:30:49,599
All yours.

1162
01:30:50,473 --> 01:30:53,769
- That's it?
- That's it.

1163
01:30:53,834 --> 01:30:57,860
I knew you'd keep your promise.
Now, where is it? Where's my treasure?

1164
01:30:57,930 --> 01:30:59,654
It's right here.

1165
01:30:59,722 --> 01:31:02,821
The map said "Heere at the wall,"
spelled with two E's.

1166
01:31:02,890 --> 01:31:05,508
Wall Street follows the path
of an actual wall

1167
01:31:05,578 --> 01:31:08,578
that the original Dutch settlers built
as a defense to keep the British out.

1168
01:31:08,650 --> 01:31:12,993
The main gate was located at a street
called De Heere, also two E's.

1169
01:31:13,067 --> 01:31:15,620
Later De Heere Street was renamed
Broadway after the British got in.

1170
01:31:15,691 --> 01:31:18,146
So, "Heere at the wall."

1171
01:31:18,219 --> 01:31:21,514
Broadway, Wall Street.

1172
01:31:21,579 --> 01:31:23,335
Cheerio.

1173
01:31:24,716 --> 01:31:26,341
Just a moment, Ben.

1174
01:31:26,411 --> 01:31:31,016
Ian, if you break our deal, the FBI
will be only a few minutes behind you.

1175
01:31:31,083 --> 01:31:33,833
You might get away, you might not.

1176
01:31:37,228 --> 01:31:39,333
Is that all the map said?

1177
01:31:41,260 --> 01:31:43,365
Every word.

1178
01:31:45,260 --> 01:31:47,464
Oh, Ben.

1179
01:31:47,532 --> 01:31:50,664
You know the key
to running a convincing bluff?

1180
01:31:50,733 --> 01:31:54,562
Every once in a while
you've got to be holding all the cards.

1181
01:32:04,941 --> 01:32:06,402
Dad.

1182
01:32:08,845 --> 01:32:11,562
Is there anything else you want to tell me?

1183
01:32:15,469 --> 01:32:18,699
Trinity Church. We have to go
inside Trinity Church.

1184
01:32:21,998 --> 01:32:24,169
Good. Excellent.

1185
01:32:24,238 --> 01:32:27,140
Well, why don't you ask Dr. Chase
and Riley to join us?

1186
01:32:27,214 --> 01:32:30,280
I'm sure they're around here somewhere.

1187
01:32:35,278 --> 01:32:37,667
Are you all right?

1188
01:32:37,742 --> 01:32:40,164
What do you think? I'm a hostage.

1189
01:32:41,615 --> 01:32:43,786
Sit. Sit down.

1190
01:32:43,854 --> 01:32:46,888
- Let him go, Ian.
- When we find the treasure.

1191
01:32:46,959 --> 01:32:51,116
No, now. Or you can figure out
the clues for yourself.

1192
01:32:51,183 --> 01:32:52,971
Good luck.

1193
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:54,414
Ben.

1194
01:32:54,479 --> 01:32:58,189
I don't think you fully appreciate
the gravity of the situation.

1195
01:33:06,287 --> 01:33:08,654
Let's have a look at that map.

1196
01:33:43,314 --> 01:33:44,743
It's, uh...

1197
01:33:46,705 --> 01:33:49,258
It's... it's really quite something. It's, uh...

1198
01:33:49,329 --> 01:33:51,631
It really is remarkable. Take a look.

1199
01:33:57,906 --> 01:34:01,835
- "Parkington Lane."
- "Beneath Parkington Lane."

1200
01:34:01,907 --> 01:34:05,736
But why would the map lead us here,
then take us somewhere else?

1201
01:34:05,810 --> 01:34:08,199
- What's the purpose?
- Just another clue.

1202
01:34:08,275 --> 01:34:12,782
Dad. No, you're right. Parkington Lane
has to be here somewhere.

1203
01:34:13,875 --> 01:34:16,396
A street inside the church?

1204
01:34:16,466 --> 01:34:18,987
Not inside. Beneath.

1205
01:34:19,059 --> 01:34:20,968
Beneath the church.

1206
01:34:25,267 --> 01:34:27,689
- I'm so sorry, Ben.
- None of this is your fault.

1207
01:34:27,764 --> 01:34:28,811
- I co...
- Come on.

1208
01:34:38,132 --> 01:34:39,539
Look.

1209
01:34:40,884 --> 01:34:44,681
Cooperation only lasts as long
as the status quo is unchanged.

1210
01:34:44,757 --> 01:34:49,459
As soon as this guy gets to wherever this
thing ends, he won't need you anymore.

1211
01:34:49,524 --> 01:34:50,801
Or... or any of us.

1212
01:34:50,869 --> 01:34:54,546
So we find a way to make sure
the status quo changes in our favor.

1213
01:34:54,612 --> 01:34:58,387
- How?
- I'm still working on it.

1214
01:34:58,452 --> 01:35:01,452
Well, I guess I better
work on it too, then.

1215
01:35:01,525 --> 01:35:04,111
Hey! Par... Hey, I found it!

1216
01:35:04,181 --> 01:35:05,904
- Him!
- Ben!

1217
01:35:06,421 --> 01:35:08,331
It's a name.

1218
01:35:11,093 --> 01:35:12,784
Parkington Lane.

1219
01:35:12,853 --> 01:35:16,399
He was a third-degree master mason
of the Blue Lo...

1220
01:35:16,470 --> 01:35:18,674
Hey! Stop!

1221
01:35:32,407 --> 01:35:33,868
Easy.

1222
01:35:35,127 --> 01:35:37,232
- Whoa!
- Oh!

1223
01:35:37,303 --> 01:35:39,278
Careful no one steps in him.

1224
01:35:39,351 --> 01:35:41,391
All right, put it down.

1225
01:35:48,023 --> 01:35:52,944
OK. Who wants to go down
the creepy tunnel inside the tomb first?

1226
01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:58,135
Right. McGregor, Viktor, you stay here.

1227
01:35:58,647 --> 01:36:03,732
And if anyone should come out without me,
well... use your imagination.

1228
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:08,429
Shall we?

1229
01:36:25,464 --> 01:36:28,148
You got a light?

1230
01:36:44,090 --> 01:36:46,359
Careful.

1231
01:36:46,426 --> 01:36:48,630
Watch your step.

1232
01:36:54,170 --> 01:36:56,079
Come here.

1233
01:37:05,051 --> 01:37:07,352
Why does that never happen to me?

1234
01:37:13,147 --> 01:37:15,057
What's this?

1235
01:37:29,916 --> 01:37:31,825
It's a chandelier.

1236
01:37:40,636 --> 01:37:41,913
Here.

1237
01:37:57,213 --> 01:37:59,930
- Wow.
- Look at the elevators.

1238
01:37:59,997 --> 01:38:01,558
A dumbwaiter system.

1239
01:38:01,629 --> 01:38:04,117
How do a bunch of guys with hand tools
build all this?

1240
01:38:04,190 --> 01:38:07,670
Same way they built the pyramids
and the Great Wall of China.

1241
01:38:07,741 --> 01:38:10,708
Yeah. The aliens helped them.

1242
01:38:10,781 --> 01:38:12,953
Right, let's go. What are we waiting for?

1243
01:38:13,341 --> 01:38:17,302
I'm not going out on that thing.
200 years of termite damage and rot.

1244
01:38:17,374 --> 01:38:20,276
Dad, do what he says.

1245
01:38:38,814 --> 01:38:40,920
Watch your step.

1246
01:38:42,719 --> 01:38:44,574
We're right under the Trinity graveyard.

1247
01:38:44,639 --> 01:38:47,159
That's probably why
no one ever found this.

1248
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:53,589
What is that?

1249
01:38:57,824 --> 01:38:59,733
Subway.

1250
01:39:05,504 --> 01:39:07,643
Shaw! Oh, God, Shaw!

1251
01:39:17,889 --> 01:39:19,743
Oh, my God.

1252
01:39:24,097 --> 01:39:26,585
Hold on! Hold on!

1253
01:39:28,993 --> 01:39:31,197
OK, get on the elevator. Jump!

1254
01:39:34,241 --> 01:39:36,380
Ben! Grab my hand.

1255
01:39:38,306 --> 01:39:39,832
- Come on.
- Ian!

1256
01:39:39,905 --> 01:39:42,556
Abigail! Get on!

1257
01:39:46,178 --> 01:39:48,033
Jump!

1258
01:39:57,154 --> 01:39:58,202
Here.

1259
01:40:06,083 --> 01:40:07,676
Ben!

1260
01:40:08,419 --> 01:40:10,939
Get down there.
Get down there!

1261
01:40:16,131 --> 01:40:17,724
The Declaration.

1262
01:40:20,804 --> 01:40:22,909
- Do you trust me?
- Yes.

1263
01:40:36,485 --> 01:40:38,241
Oh, no! Ben!

1264
01:40:38,308 --> 01:40:39,737
Oh!

1265
01:40:44,197 --> 01:40:46,084
Hang on!

1266
01:40:54,469 --> 01:40:55,898
Son!

1267
01:41:02,662 --> 01:41:06,524
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I dropped you.
I had to save the Declaration.

1268
01:41:06,598 --> 01:41:10,973
No, don't be. I would have done
exactly the same thing to you.

1269
01:41:11,046 --> 01:41:13,119
Really?

1270
01:41:13,190 --> 01:41:16,638
I would have dropped you both.
Freaks.

1271
01:41:23,846 --> 01:41:25,985
Get on.

1272
01:41:26,055 --> 01:41:27,778
Ian...

1273
01:41:27,846 --> 01:41:30,181
it's not worth it.

1274
01:41:30,247 --> 01:41:34,720
Do you imagine any one of your lives
is more valuable to me than Shaw's?

1275
01:41:34,791 --> 01:41:36,035
We go on.

1276
01:41:37,767 --> 01:41:41,564
The status quo.
Keep the status quo.

1277
01:41:48,967 --> 01:41:52,131
- Now what?
- This is...

1278
01:41:52,199 --> 01:41:54,949
This is where it all leads.

1279
01:42:04,008 --> 01:42:05,917
OK, let's go.

1280
01:42:47,082 --> 01:42:49,537
What is this?

1281
01:42:49,610 --> 01:42:51,912
So where's the treasure?

1282
01:42:54,731 --> 01:42:56,040
Well?

1283
01:42:57,611 --> 01:42:59,782
This is it?

1284
01:42:59,850 --> 01:43:02,152
We came all this way
for a dead end?

1285
01:43:03,435 --> 01:43:04,776
Yes.

1286
01:43:07,883 --> 01:43:10,600
- There's gotta be something more.
- Riley, there's nothing more.

1287
01:43:10,667 --> 01:43:12,936
- Another clue, or...
- No, there are no more clues!

1288
01:43:13,003 --> 01:43:14,596
That's it, OK? It's over!

1289
01:43:14,667 --> 01:43:18,628
End of the road. The treasure's gone.
Moved. Taken somewhere else.

1290
01:43:19,884 --> 01:43:23,681
You're not playing games with me,
are you, Ben? Hm?

1291
01:43:23,756 --> 01:43:26,658
You know where it is.

1292
01:43:26,732 --> 01:43:28,357
No.

1293
01:43:31,916 --> 01:43:34,120
OK, go.

1294
01:43:34,189 --> 01:43:36,839
Hey, wait a minute.

1295
01:43:37,229 --> 01:43:39,400
- Hey! Ian, wait!
- Wait, wait, wait!

1296
01:43:39,468 --> 01:43:41,094
- Ian...
- We'll be trapped.

1297
01:43:41,165 --> 01:43:43,554
- Don't do this.
- You can't just leave us here.

1298
01:43:43,629 --> 01:43:47,404
Yes, I can.
Unless Ben tells me the next clue.

1299
01:43:47,469 --> 01:43:49,608
There isn't another clue.

1300
01:43:49,677 --> 01:43:53,954
Ian, why don't you come back down here
and we can talk through this together?

1301
01:43:54,029 --> 01:43:56,451
- Don't speak again.
- OK.

1302
01:43:57,838 --> 01:44:01,766
The clue. Where's the treasure?

1303
01:44:02,830 --> 01:44:03,877
Ben?

1304
01:44:06,830 --> 01:44:08,805
- The lantern.
- Dad...

1305
01:44:10,190 --> 01:44:12,426
The status quo has changed, son.

1306
01:44:12,494 --> 01:44:13,989
Don't.

1307
01:44:16,910 --> 01:44:20,587
It's part of freemason teachings.

1308
01:44:20,654 --> 01:44:23,950
In King Solomon's temple
there was a winding staircase.

1309
01:44:24,015 --> 01:44:29,732
It signified the journey that had to be made
to find the light of truth.

1310
01:44:29,807 --> 01:44:33,517
- The lantern is the clue.
- And what does it mean?

1311
01:44:33,583 --> 01:44:36,004
Boston. It's Boston.

1312
01:44:36,079 --> 01:44:37,705
The Old North Church in Boston,

1313
01:44:37,775 --> 01:44:41,124
where Thomas Newton
hung a lantern in the steeple,

1314
01:44:41,199 --> 01:44:44,974
to signal Paul Revere that the British
were coming. One if by land, two if by sea.

1315
01:44:45,039 --> 01:44:50,058
One lantern. Under the winding staircase
of the steeple, that's where we have to look.

1316
01:44:50,128 --> 01:44:53,357
- Thank you.
- Hey, you have to take us with you.

1317
01:44:53,424 --> 01:44:56,490
Why? So you can escape in Boston?

1318
01:44:56,559 --> 01:45:00,007
Besides, with you out of the picture
there's less baggage to carry.

1319
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:02,252
What if we lied?

1320
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:03,530
Did you?

1321
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:06,251
What if there's another clue?

1322
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:08,393
Then I'll know right where to find you.

1323
01:45:10,064 --> 01:45:11,952
See you, Ben.

1324
01:45:14,352 --> 01:45:16,011
- No!
- There's no other way out!

1325
01:45:16,081 --> 01:45:18,055
- Come back!
- You're gonna need us, Ian!

1326
01:45:19,025 --> 01:45:21,327
We're all gonna die.

1327
01:45:21,393 --> 01:45:25,255
It's gonna be OK, Riley.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1328
01:45:25,329 --> 01:45:27,369
It's OK, kiddo.

1329
01:45:27,441 --> 01:45:32,843
OK, boys, what's going on? The British
came by sea. It was two lanterns, not one.

1330
01:45:32,914 --> 01:45:35,980
Ian needed another clue,
so we gave it to him.

1331
01:45:36,050 --> 01:45:38,832
It was a fake.
It was a fake clue.

1332
01:45:38,898 --> 01:45:41,386
The all-seeing eye.

1333
01:45:41,458 --> 01:45:43,825
"Through the all-seeing eye."

1334
01:45:44,562 --> 01:45:47,431
That means... by the time Ian
figures it out and comes back here,

1335
01:45:47,506 --> 01:45:51,084
we'll still be trapped,
and he'll shoot us then.

1336
01:45:51,571 --> 01:45:54,124
Either way, we're gonna die.

1337
01:45:54,930 --> 01:45:58,094
Nobody's gonna die.
There's another way out.

1338
01:45:58,643 --> 01:45:59,658
Where?

1339
01:45:59,731 --> 01:46:02,251
Through the treasure room.

1340
01:46:08,756 --> 01:46:10,665
Here.

1341
01:46:20,052 --> 01:46:21,743
Riley.

1342
01:46:47,253 --> 01:46:50,549
Looks like someone got here first.

1343
01:46:51,733 --> 01:46:54,188
I'm sorry, Ben.

1344
01:46:54,261 --> 01:46:56,017
It's gone.

1345
01:46:58,422 --> 01:47:01,007
- Listen, Ben...
- It may have even been gone

1346
01:47:01,077 --> 01:47:04,820
before Charles Carroll
told the story to Thomas Gates.

1347
01:47:05,974 --> 01:47:08,014
It doesn't matter.

1348
01:47:08,085 --> 01:47:10,933
I know. 'Cause you were right.

1349
01:47:10,998 --> 01:47:13,748
No, I wasn't right.

1350
01:47:13,814 --> 01:47:16,400
This room is real, Ben.

1351
01:47:16,471 --> 01:47:18,707
And that means the treasure is real.

1352
01:47:19,191 --> 01:47:21,908
We're in the company of
some of the most brilliant minds in history,

1353
01:47:21,975 --> 01:47:25,652
because you found
what they left behind for us to find

1354
01:47:25,719 --> 01:47:28,207
and understood the meaning of it.

1355
01:47:28,279 --> 01:47:31,094
You did it, Ben. For all of us.

1356
01:47:32,055 --> 01:47:35,219
Your grandfather, and all of us.

1357
01:47:35,672 --> 01:47:39,534
And I've never been so happy
to be proven wrong.

1358
01:47:49,464 --> 01:47:51,537
I just...

1359
01:47:51,608 --> 01:47:54,575
really thought
I was gonna find the treasure.

1360
01:47:56,441 --> 01:47:58,295
OK.

1361
01:47:58,361 --> 01:48:01,012
Then we just keep looking for it.

1362
01:48:04,153 --> 01:48:06,062
I'm in.

1363
01:48:10,585 --> 01:48:12,341
OK.

1364
01:48:13,881 --> 01:48:16,914
Not to be Johnny Rain Cloud here,
but that's not gonna happen.

1365
01:48:16,985 --> 01:48:20,182
Because as far as I can see,
we're still trapped down here.

1366
01:48:20,249 --> 01:48:22,638
Yeah.

1367
01:48:22,714 --> 01:48:24,536
Now, Ben,
where is this other way out?

1368
01:48:24,601 --> 01:48:26,609
Well, that's it.
It doesn't make any sense,

1369
01:48:26,681 --> 01:48:29,748
because the first thing the builders
would have done after getting down here

1370
01:48:29,818 --> 01:48:32,752
was cut a secondary shaft back out for air...

1371
01:48:32,825 --> 01:48:35,859
- Right.
...and in case of cave-ins.

1372
01:48:57,178 --> 01:49:00,146
Could it really be that simple?

1373
01:49:04,411 --> 01:49:06,550
"The secret lies with Charlotte."

1374
01:50:30,911 --> 01:50:33,780
Scrolls from the library at Alexandria.

1375
01:50:35,808 --> 01:50:37,597
Could this be possible?

1376
01:50:56,321 --> 01:51:01,177
It's a big... bluish-green man,

1377
01:51:01,249 --> 01:51:03,998
with a strange-looking goatee.

1378
01:51:04,064 --> 01:51:06,748
I'm guessing that's significant.

1379
01:51:54,115 --> 01:51:55,064
Yes!

1380
01:52:06,404 --> 01:52:08,990
Riley, are you crying?

1381
01:52:09,060 --> 01:52:11,067
Look.

1382
01:52:11,140 --> 01:52:13,212
Stairs.

1383
01:52:28,869 --> 01:52:30,843
Hi.

1384
01:52:30,916 --> 01:52:32,826
Do you have a cell phone I could borrow?

1385
01:52:45,414 --> 01:52:48,283
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

1386
01:52:48,357 --> 01:52:51,554
You do know you just handed me
your biggest bargaining chip?

1387
01:52:51,622 --> 01:52:54,786
The Declaration of Independence
is not a bargaining chip.

1388
01:52:54,854 --> 01:52:56,512
Not to me.

1389
01:52:56,581 --> 01:52:58,240
Have a seat.

1390
01:52:58,662 --> 01:53:01,444
- So what's your offer?
- Oh...

1391
01:53:01,510 --> 01:53:04,325
How about a bribe? Say, uh...

1392
01:53:05,286 --> 01:53:08,450
ten billion dollars?

1393
01:53:08,518 --> 01:53:10,111
I take it you found the treasure?

1394
01:53:10,182 --> 01:53:12,670
It's about five stories
beneath your shoes.

1395
01:53:14,118 --> 01:53:16,257
Hm.

1396
01:53:16,327 --> 01:53:18,367
You know, the Templars
and the Freemasons believed

1397
01:53:18,439 --> 01:53:22,978
that the treasure was too great
for any one man to have, not even a king.

1398
01:53:23,047 --> 01:53:26,659
That's why they went to such lengths
to keep it hidden.

1399
01:53:26,727 --> 01:53:29,029
That's right.

1400
01:53:29,095 --> 01:53:32,511
The Founding Fathers believed
the same thing about government.

1401
01:53:32,583 --> 01:53:35,715
I figure their solution
will work for the treasure too.

1402
01:53:36,168 --> 01:53:37,215
Give it to the people.

1403
01:53:37,288 --> 01:53:42,176
Divide it amongst the Smithsonian,
the Louvre, the Cairo museum...

1404
01:53:42,248 --> 01:53:45,248
There's thousands of years
of world history down there.

1405
01:53:45,320 --> 01:53:49,576
And it belongs to the world,
and everybody in it.

1406
01:53:49,640 --> 01:53:53,218
You really don't understand
the concept of a bargaining chip.

1407
01:53:53,800 --> 01:53:58,273
OK, here's what I want.
Dr. Chase gets off completely clean,

1408
01:53:58,344 --> 01:54:00,352
not even a little Post-it
on her service record.

1409
01:54:00,425 --> 01:54:01,286
OK.

1410
01:54:01,353 --> 01:54:07,333
I want the credit for the find
to go to the entire Gates family,

1411
01:54:07,401 --> 01:54:10,085
with the assistance of Mr. Riley Poole.

1412
01:54:10,153 --> 01:54:12,389
And what about you?

1413
01:54:12,457 --> 01:54:14,399
I'd really love not to go to prison.

1414
01:54:14,473 --> 01:54:19,230
I can't even begin to describe
how much I would love not to go to prison.

1415
01:54:20,425 --> 01:54:23,393
Someone's got to go to prison, Ben.

1416
01:54:23,466 --> 01:54:28,419
Well, if you've got a helicopter,
I think I can help with that.

1417
01:54:36,523 --> 01:54:38,759
Freeze! FBI!

1418
01:54:40,778 --> 01:54:42,950
- Freeze! Don't move!
- Show me your hands!

1419
01:54:44,714 --> 01:54:48,031
- Put your hands up.
- Move, move, move.

1420
01:54:51,531 --> 01:54:53,354
You're under arrest, Mr. Howe.

1421
01:54:53,419 --> 01:54:56,648
We've got you on kidnapping,
attempted murder...

1422
01:54:56,715 --> 01:54:59,585
and trespassing on government property.

1423
01:55:07,596 --> 01:55:10,313
Yeah. You got it, chief.
Thank you. Bye.

1424
01:55:11,404 --> 01:55:14,273
They want us in Cairo next week
for the opening of the exhibit.

1425
01:55:14,348 --> 01:55:16,170
They're sending a private jet.

1426
01:55:16,236 --> 01:55:17,447
That's fun.

1427
01:55:17,516 --> 01:55:21,193
Yeah, big whoop. We could have had
a whole fleet of private jets.

1428
01:55:21,260 --> 01:55:24,326
Ten percent, Ben. They offered you
ten percent and you turned it down.

1429
01:55:24,396 --> 01:55:27,713
Riley, we've been over this.
It was too much. I couldn't accept it.

1430
01:55:27,789 --> 01:55:31,782
I still have this splinter that's been festering
for three months from an old piece of wood.

1431
01:55:31,853 --> 01:55:32,868
OK, I'll tell you what.

1432
01:55:32,941 --> 01:55:36,618
Next time we find a treasure
that redefines history for all mankind,

1433
01:55:36,685 --> 01:55:38,595
you make the call on the finder's fee.

1434
01:55:38,669 --> 01:55:41,059
That's not as funny.

1435
01:55:41,133 --> 01:55:43,108
What do you care?
You got the girl.

1436
01:55:44,078 --> 01:55:45,703
- It's true.
- It's true.

1437
01:55:48,974 --> 01:55:51,014
Rub it in.
Enjoy your spoils...

1438
01:55:51,086 --> 01:55:53,475
while I sit on one percent.

1439
01:55:55,022 --> 01:55:57,804
One stinkin' percent.
Half of one percent, actually.

1440
01:55:58,286 --> 01:56:00,653
One percent. Unbelievable.

1441
01:56:00,718 --> 01:56:02,627
I'm sorry for your suffering, Riley.

1442
01:56:02,702 --> 01:56:06,892
For the record, Ben,
I like the house.

1443
01:56:06,959 --> 01:56:10,254
You know, I chose this estate
because in 1812 Charles Carroll met...

1444
01:56:10,318 --> 01:56:14,955
Yeah, someone that did something
in history and had fun. Great. Wonderful.

1445
01:56:15,023 --> 01:56:16,681
Could have had a bigger house.

1446
01:56:25,104 --> 01:56:28,682
- I made something for you.
- You did? What?

1447
01:56:28,751 --> 01:56:30,660
- A map.
- A map?

1448
01:56:32,080 --> 01:56:33,935
Where does it lead to?

1449
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,815
You'll figure it out.

1450
