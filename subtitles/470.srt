1
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:57,974
[Jeanine] Peace.

2
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:03,980
Long ago, before
The Founders established
this great city of ours,

3
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,441
that word
was all but meaningless.

4
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:10,236
An ideal as elusive as a dream.

5
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,447
Now, 200 years later,

6
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:17,077
we are, all of us,
living proof that peace
is indeed attainable.

7
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:21,706
The reason for this is,
of course, our Faction System.

8
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:26,503
Erudite, Dauntless, Amity,
Candor, Abnegation.

9
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:30,006
In dividing people according
to personality and aptitude,

10
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:34,135
we've created a society
in which each faction
plays a critical role

11
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,638
in maintaining
the social order.

12
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:39,516
But this harmony we've
achieved is now under attack

13
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:42,227
from a small
but extremely dangerous group
of individuals.

14
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,436
[indistinct chatter]

15
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,189
We call them Divergents.

16
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,274
They are, in essence,

17
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,819
the worst of what
humanity used to be.

18
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:54,614
Rebellious, defiant
and uncontrollable.

19
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:58,785
Five days ago,
a rogue group of Divergents,

20
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,120
posing as Dauntless

21
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,163
brutally invaded Abnegation.

22
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,457
An obvious attempt
to cripple the Faction System

23
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,709
by attacking
its most vulnerable members.

24
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,131
These Divergents
despise our system

25
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,550
because they are incapable
of conforming to it.

26
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,552
These latest rumors,
for example,

27
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,513
that I was somehow behind
the attack on Abnegation,

28
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:21,975
nothing more
than Divergent propaganda.

29
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,185
I am devoting myself

30
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,479
to bringing these fugitives
to justice.

31
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:30,191
-I've exercised my right
as acting Council leader...
-[woman screaming]

32
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,651
...to declare martial law

33
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:35,530
until I'm confident
that any threat to our security
has been eliminated.

34
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,282
Tell Jeanine we got it.

35
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,954
[Jeanine] We are all
that is left of humanity.

36
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:45,623
The vast wall
that encloses this city

37
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,459
may protect us
from our toxic surroundings,

38
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,545
but it is up to us to confront

39
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:53,172
any element that could
poison us from within.

40
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:56,217
Because, when you are
civilization's last hope,

41
00:02:56,384 --> 00:03:00,722
peace is not merely an ideal.
It is an obligation.

42
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,433
And it is up to all of us
to take a stand

43
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,518
against its one true enemy,

44
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,354
Divergents.

45
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:12,984
[Tris panting]

46
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,117
[birds cawing]

47
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:35,340
[panting]

48
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,222
Amity.

49
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,142
We need to make sure
it's clear.

50
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:48,895
Tris!

51
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:08,706
Help us. Please help us.
Please.

52
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,043
Please help us.

53
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:13,127
You have to help us.

54
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,546
[Johanna]
Sorry, you have to leave.

55
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,132
You just don't belong here.

56
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,968
[Christina] It's all her fault.

57
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,474
You killed Will.

58
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:29,769
-No.
-[people murmuring]

59
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,854
[all whispering]
She killed him.

60
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,357
She killed him. She killed him.

61
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,901
She killed him.

62
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,823
Mama.

63
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:44,909
Mama.

64
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,830
-You killed us all.
-Will!

65
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:50,790
-[gunshot echoes]
-[gasps]

66
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,459
[panting]

67
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,508
[sighs in relief]

68
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,888
[birds cawing]

69
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,733
[children shouting]

70
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,278
And three!

71
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:45,363
[boy] Higher!

72
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:48,658
Hey.

73
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,034
[boy] Higher! Higher!

74
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,369
[Four] Wanna go higher?

75
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,287
[woman]
All right, everyone,
back to class. Let's go.

76
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,123
[Four]
Okay. Here we go. [grunts]

77
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,958
See ya. Bye.

78
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,085
[children shouting gleefully]

79
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,555
I just wanted to do
something different.

80
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,599
Yeah.

81
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,447
Well, it's definitely
different.

82
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,531
[both chuckle]

83
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,033
You don't like it?

84
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,244
No, I like it. I like it a lot.

85
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,371
I'm just surprised, that's all.

86
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,584
What's goin' on, Tris?

87
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:43,546
Nothin'. I'm fine. Just...

88
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:46,716
Still having nightmares?

89
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:51,888
No.

90
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:57,977
We're good.

91
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,314
You and me.

92
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,193
I know nothing else is,
but we are.

93
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,864
[woman on PA] Good morning,
and have a blessed day.

94
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,199
[sighs]

95
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:12,909
Time for chores.

96
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:24,295
[woman] All planters,
report to the dome.
All planters to the dome.

97
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,007
[Tris laughing]

98
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,092
[Tris] How much longer
do we have to stay here, Four?

99
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,094
[Four] Until we know
it's safe to leave.

100
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,307
[intense music playing]

101
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,668
[Four] Hey.

102
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,294
[Tris] Hi.

103
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,922
[Marcus] Son...

104
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,176
You can't ignore me forever.

105
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,472
I know you're thinkin'
about your next move,

106
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,015
but there are things
you don't know.

107
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,226
Marcus, please
just leave us alone.

108
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,981
Your mother didn't come back
to Abnegation just to save you.

109
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,774
She died trying to hide
something from Jeanine.

110
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,943
Something that was entrusted
to Abnegation a long time ago.

111
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,278
Marcus, stop.

112
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:33,322
Whatever you want from us,
you're not gonna get it.

113
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,661
I'm not the enemy here.

114
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,508
You found it.

115
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,556
It was in the home
of Natalie and Andrew Prior,

116
00:09:58,723 --> 00:09:59,765
like you said.

117
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,025
Mind telling me what's inside?

118
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,028
[Jeanine]
A message from The Founders
that will ensure

119
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,904
the future our people deserve.

120
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,328
Divergents will destroy
our society.

121
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,789
Unless we destroy them.

122
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,545
And now we can.

123
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:34,508
However, only a Divergent
can open this box.

124
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:44,226
Find them.
Every last one of them.

125
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:51,400
[indistinct conversations]

126
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:03,871
[man] Go with happiness.

127
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,332
Go with happiness.

128
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,044
-Go with happiness.
-Thank you.

129
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,004
Go with happiness.

130
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:15,674
Go with happiness.

131
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:18,761
I really don't know
how much longer

132
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,679
I can do this whole peace
and love thing.

133
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,848
It's the Amity way, all right?
We're just trying to blend in.

134
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:23,808
[Tris scoffs]

135
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,685
I'm trying to blend in.
It's just not working.

136
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,271
[Peter]
Comin' through on your right.
Okay, here we go.

137
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,606
Hey, look, a rainbow.

138
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:31,690
-Oh.
-It's pretty.

139
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,401
[woman] Go with happiness.

140
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,861
Virtual pathological
friendliness
with unquestioned passivism?

141
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,614
I love this place.
Thank you. Go with happiness.

142
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,117
Oops, excuse me.

143
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,827
Hey, Tris, I really like
your hair, by the way.

144
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,121
Did you try to cut it all short
and weird like that?

145
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,498
Peter, why don't you take
your food and sit down, huh?

146
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:48,582
Or what?

147
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,254
Besides, I think we should all
stick together now that we're

148
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:54,672
-all officially fugitives.
-[Tris shushes]

149
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,382
Wait, what do you mean,
"officially fugitives"?

150
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:57,716
-Oh, you don't know?
-Let's go, let's go.

151
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,884
You didn't tell Caleb?

152
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,929
Yeah, so now Jeanine is saying
that the attack on Abnegation

153
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,765
was orchestrated by a group
of renegade Divergents

154
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,100
and their sympathizers.

155
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,601
So then they're blaming
this whole thing on us?

156
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:12,898
Yeah. Jeanine needed a reason
to petition the Council
to institute martial law.

157
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,775
Now she has one.

158
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,485
[chuckling]

159
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,495
Staying here at Amity is still
our best option for now.

160
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,289
We need to keep an ear
to the ground.

161
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:30,207
Find out where
the rest of the Dauntless are.

162
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,835
Then we can make a move.

163
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,753
We need to kill Jeanine.

164
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,631
I know.

165
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,758
But we're not ready yet.

166
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,095
[sighs]

167
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,890
Beatrice, you're not
being serious, right?

168
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,933
No, I am being serious.

169
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,395
I'm not gonna stop
until she's dead.

170
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,647
Tris, you can't just
go around killing people.

171
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,149
No, she's right.
Listen to your sister.

172
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:59,612
Tris, I think
you should go to Erudite
and kill Jeanine yourself.

173
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,448
I'll stay with Caleb so that
you don't get him killed, too.

174
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,244
What?

175
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:08,829
[Peter] Come on, you know.

176
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,249
Like you did your parents.

177
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:18,881
[both grunting]

178
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:28,724
[Four] Come on!

179
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,645
What do you think you're doing?

180
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,733
My office. Now.

181
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,696
Enjoy your meal, everyone.
Enjoy your meal.

182
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,157
Calm down. Just calm down.

183
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:54,500
Was I not clear that the terms
of your sanctuary here

184
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,168
included nonviolence?

185
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,214
I can guarantee you
nothing like this
will ever happen again.

186
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,217
Well, be that as it may,

187
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,802
you can no longer stay
here with us.

188
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,305
Your presence
is just too disruptive.

189
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:15,187
Truth is that our sanctuary
was never gonna last
very long here anyways.

190
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,940
Was it? With you
not standing up to Jeanine.

191
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,066
[scoffs]

192
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,610
You don't understand us at all.

193
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,695
[Tris] No, I do understand you.

194
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:25,030
I understand that you think
you can stay out of this.

195
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,365
But you can't.

196
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:29,076
One day she's gonna show up
and Jeanine is gonna take
whatever power

197
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,244
you think you have
away from you.

198
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,245
[Four] Tris, Tris...

199
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:34,748
[inhales deeply]

200
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:38,711
[Four] Look, Johanna,
we need a little more time.

201
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,005
I need to find
out where the rest
of the Dauntless are.

202
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,172
Then we can leave.

203
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:45,301
And then what? Attack Erudite?

204
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,511
I will not be
a party to violence.

205
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,179
[Four]
And no one's asking you to.

206
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,056
We just need a few more days.

207
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,520
One.

208
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,399
One what?

209
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,027
One more chance.

210
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,866
See, to be Amity is to forgive.

211
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:12,411
Others. And yourself.

212
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,914
You're hurting, Tris.

213
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,878
And my heart goes out to you.

214
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:26,258
I know what it's like
to stand helpless

215
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,302
while you lose
the ones you love.

216
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,933
But killing Jeanine
is not going to bring
your mother back.

217
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,727
I know you're angry.

218
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,729
But you're letting it
consume you.

219
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,481
[footsteps approaching]

220
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:44,068
-[Johanna] What is it?
-[vehicles approaching]

221
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,949
[intense music playing]

222
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,921
Stay here. And keep quiet.

223
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,688
[indistinct chatter]

224
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:25,818
[Johanna] Gentlemen,

225
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,737
Amity welcomes you.

226
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:29,905
To what do we owe the pleasure?

227
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,615
This isn't really
a social call, Johanna.

228
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,200
We're looking for Divergents.

229
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,829
I see. Well, of course,
anything we can do to help.

230
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,248
Gonna need you to volunteer
your faction to be tested.

231
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,420
-New screening technology
from Erudite.
-[electronic voice] Amity...

232
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,879
Now that Jeanine's
heading up the Council,

233
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,756
the approval process
just got a little easier.

234
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,967
You're exceeding
your jurisdiction.

235
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:54,596
Now, Johanna, what happened
to that Amity politeness?

236
00:16:56,056 --> 00:17:00,102
The easy way or the hard way?
It's up to you.

237
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,066
All right.

238
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,485
But under protest.

239
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,073
Okay, we're good to go!
Move it out! Round 'em up.

240
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,199
[man] In the dome.

241
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,452
[male announcer on PA]
All Amity report to the dome

242
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,996
for new mandatory testing.

243
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:24,043
Please proceed to the dome
for mandatory testing.

244
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,254
[soldier 1] In the building.
Let's go. Get inside.

245
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,214
-Line up.
-[women screaming]

246
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,552
Let's go. Move it.

247
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:34,803
[soldier 2] This way.

248
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,348
[soldier 3] Line it up.

249
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,726
[man] Building secured.

250
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,605
[Eric]
You know something, lady?

251
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,609
You seem awfully stuck
in that doorway.

252
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:49,860
[laughs]

253
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:04,750
Eric's here.
We need to move now.
Come on.

254
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,926
What's up there?

255
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,762
-[whispering] Wait, stop.
-[Johanna] Just my office.

256
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,515
[horse whinnying]

257
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,520
[whispering] Go, go, go!

258
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,946
Hmm.

259
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,241
Hey.

260
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,035
There's two guards with guns.

261
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,955
We're going out the window?

262
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:45,833
We need to split up.

263
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,462
Okay, yeah. Okay.

264
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:52,923
Every man for themselves.

265
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,259
Good.

266
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,721
-Hey, they're up here! Hey!
-[Four] Go, go, go, go!

267
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,182
Eric, they're up here!
Come on, they're getting away!

268
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,561
All right, you ready?

269
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,149
[all grunting]

270
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,364
[Four] Let's go.

271
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,576
-Where?
-Out the window.

272
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,705
I got three on foot making
a break toward the dome.

273
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,915
-[electronic voice] Divergent.
-Got one.

274
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,168
[Eric on radio] I repeat,
three on foot toward the dome.

275
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,752
Over there!

276
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,255
-I demand amnesty!
-Get down! Now!

277
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,215
I'm the leader of Abnegation!
It is my right!

278
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,221
[people screaming]

279
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:45,017
Detain him!

280
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,436
-Whoa. Okay. All right.
-[soldier 1] Let's go.

281
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,609
Come on.

282
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:54,776
[vehicles approaching]

283
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:56,862
Come on, keep moving.

284
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,781
[intense music playing]

285
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:10,417
Come on!
Come on!

286
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,219
Come on.

287
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:26,558
Let's go!

288
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,783
[panting]

289
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,996
[Four] Keep going. Come on.

290
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:55,629
[train whistle blowing]

291
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:57,506
-[Four] Listen!
-[Caleb] What?

292
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:58,590
[Tris] Train!

293
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,219
-[Four] Go, go, go!
-[gunfire]

294
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,391
[Four]
Go! Come on!

295
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:08,725
Caleb!

296
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,435
Keep moving!

297
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,443
Go!

298
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,405
Ammo!

299
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,671
[Four]
Come on, come on!
Go! Go! Move!

300
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:54,813
[grunting]

301
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,400
Move! Go, go, go!

302
00:21:58,483 --> 00:21:59,776
Caleb!

303
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,111
Move!

304
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:12,956
[grunts]

305
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,676
[all panting]

306
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,601
[door opens]

307
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:40,025
Oh, you folks sure know
how to make an entrance.

308
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:44,654
[sighs]

309
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:46,198
[Four] Factionless.

310
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:47,365
[Edgar] Amity?

311
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,827
But you stand like Dauntless.

312
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,164
No idea what this one is.

313
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:56,708
Look, we just need to get
to the city, that's all.

314
00:22:56,792 --> 00:23:01,421
Well, too bad. Train's taken.
And you damaged our cargo.

315
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,968
[Caleb] These are
Abnegation fabric bolts.

316
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:08,887
And you're Factionless, right?

317
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:10,889
-Caleb.
-I used to be Abnegation.

318
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:14,142
We used to use those same bolts
to make clothes for you.

319
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,479
You're saying that
we're stealing from you?

320
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,440
No. No, no, no.
I'm no longer Abnegation.

321
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,317
So technically you're
not stealing from me, but...

322
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,236
[stammers]
No, you're not stealing at all.

323
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,738
[stuttering]
I mean, maybe.

324
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,449
It's a question of semantics,
I suppose, whether it's
stealing or charity.

325
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,784
[stammering]
But it's all really the same.

326
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,119
[Tris] That's enough! Get off!

327
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,745
Everybody, relax.
All right, you made your point.

328
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,372
We'll get off your train,
all right?

329
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:37,415
Got you. Will everybody
just relax, okay?

330
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,000
Why don't we, uh, take a seat!

331
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,085
[grunts]

332
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:42,295
-[Tris] Caleb!
-[all clamoring]

333
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,214
-[Four] Stop!
-I'm sorry, I was
just trying to help.

334
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:45,173
Don't!

335
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,508
Oh, yeah,
this is gonna be fun,
isn't it?

336
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,802
Everybody, just calm down.
All right?

337
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:52,806
Oh.

338
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,938

00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:16,640
[Tris] No!

351
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:19,476
Get off of me! Get off!

352
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:48,421
You all right? You okay?

353
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:50,924
Yeah.

00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,520
You say that again.

357
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:06,231
Tobias Eaton.

358
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,526
What? You know him?

359
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,195
I am him.

360
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,531
[laughing]

361
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,078
We have been looking for you.

362
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:23,373
Four, what are they
talking about?

363
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:25,834
Four.

364
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,011
[grunts]

365
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:43,184
Follow me.

366
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:45,228
[indistinct chatter]

367
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:51,109
[Caleb] Tris.
I'm sorry. I wanted to help...

368
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,330
[Tris] Four.

369
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:06,416
Four, why are they
looking for you?

370
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,877
How do they know your name?

371
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,590
[indistinct conversations]

372
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:20,180
[guns cocking]

373
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,433
This is Factionless?

374
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,978
This is insane.

375
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,599
Tobias.

376
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,563
Mother.

377
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:19,197
[whispering]
I thought she was dead.

378
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,535
Me too.

379
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:42,345
Someone please tell me
what's going on here.

380
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,269
Tobias' father
was very abusive.

381
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:53,148
I knew the only way
I could ever truly escape him

382
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:56,359
would be
to disappear completely.

383
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,114
Abnegation helped me
fake my death.

384
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:04,033
Anything to protect
Marcus' image.

385
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:07,162
But you just left him there
alone with Marcus?

386
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,247
I was very young.

387
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,793
I reached out to him
about a year ago.

388
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,421
I felt it was finally time
to reconnect.

389
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:17,505
[laughs]

390
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,175
I'm still your mother.

391
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:22,719
No, my mother's dead.

392
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,388
I went to her funeral
when I was six.

393
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:29,058
And she wasn't trying
to reconnect with me.

394
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:32,437
She was trying to use me,
like you are now.

395
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,022
Why?

396
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,107
She wants an army.

397
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,360
-An army?
-I want an alliance.

398
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:41,154
No, what you want is revenge.

399
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:42,655
-This isn't about me.
-[scoffs]

400
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:44,240
It's about putting an end
to a system that says

401
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:47,035
one group is more deserving
than another.

402
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,078
This city may be surrounded
by a wall,

403
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:51,706
but it doesn't have to be
a prison.

404
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,833
-I think that's a bit extreme.
-Hmm?

405
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:57,253
I mean, the Faction System
isn't perfect,
but it's hardly a prison.

406
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,881
Let me guess. Erudite.

407
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:03,551
I was Erudite.

408
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:10,350
You willing to kill Jeanine?

409
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,519
Absolutely.

410
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:16,064
When I was married to Marcus,
I knew her well.

411
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:19,067
And believe me,
there's nothing
she isn't capable of.

412
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,069
But I think
you already know that.

413
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,488
Tris, we can't trust her.

414
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:28,201
-Or maybe she knows--
-We're on the same side, Tris.

415
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,746
I'm Factionless
because I don't fit
into any one faction.

416
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,833
And you're Divergent because
you belong to too many.

417
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,585
But we're both
a threat to Jeanine.

418
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:41,464
My people are ready for war,
if that's what it takes.

419
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:42,757
And then what?

420
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,679
-We depose those in power.
-And once you've done that?

421
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,891
Once you've killed Jeanine,
who's in power then?

422
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:57,105
See, that's the part
that she always conveniently
leaves out.

423
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:01,359
Don't you tell me
this isn't about you.

424
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:03,194
This is only about you.

425
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,283
I know where the remaining
Dauntless are hiding.

426
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:09,868
Where?

427
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,744
They took shelter in Candor.

428
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,705
As far as I know,
they're still there.

429
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:15,790
Think about it.

430
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:19,419
If we were to combine forces,
Dauntless and Factionless,

431
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,588
we'd be unstoppable.

432
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,047
That's not gonna happen.

433
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:27,844
Thank you for your hospitality,
but we'll be leaving
in the morning.

434
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,470
Four, maybe this is...

435
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,264
Tobias, please, reconsider.

436
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,474
Don't you call me that.

437
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:38,021
My name's Four.

438
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:49,532
You wanna tuck him in,
or should I?

439
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:08,468
[door slamming]

440
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:14,015
Well, this...
This meal looks lovely.

441
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,102
Thank you.

442
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,784
I'm sorry.

443
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:42,293
I should have told you
about her.

444
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:44,587
[sighs]

445
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:56,849
No more secrets. Okay?

446
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:07,986
[gasps]

447
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:11,656
[whispering] I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to wake you.

448
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,912
I always loved
watching him sleep.

449
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,502
I take it you're setting out
for Candor in the morning?

450
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,045
Yeah.

451
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:34,554
Listen, I only want
what's best for him.

452
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:38,391
You hardly even know him.

453
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:43,021
You'd like to think that,
wouldn't you?

454
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,314
But deep down,
I think you're scared

455
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:46,482
I know him all too well.

456
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,321
-I'm not scared.
-Of course you are.

457
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:56,576
You're scared
he'll finally see you
for what you really are.

458
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,371
Deadly.

459
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,417
You don't believe me?

460
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:09,922
Ask him.

461
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:14,677
[panting]

462
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:18,347
[Four] You okay?

463
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,308
Yeah.

464
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:23,770
You sure?

465
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:25,688
Yeah.

466
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:41,704
[intense music playing]

467
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,155
I'm not coming with you guys.

468
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:17,782
What?

469
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:23,496
To Candor.
I'm not coming with you guys.

470
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:27,792
What are you talking about?

471
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,544
What's your plan?

472
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:32,630
You guys are gonna find
the rest of Dauntless.
Then what?

473
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:36,592
You attack Erudite,
assassinate Jeanine,
start a civil war?

474
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:41,139
I'm sorry, I'm just not...
I'm not cut out for that.

475
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:44,058
I'm not like you guys.

476
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,232
I need to go back
to Abnegation, maybe.

477
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,608
Sort out what
our parents left behind.

478
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,360
At least I'd be useful there.

479
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:57,071
Caleb, there's nothing left
at Abnegation.

480
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,033
Yeah.

481
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:36,903
-You okay?
-Just need to get to Candor.

482
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,033
Tris.

483
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:48,206
I know you think Caleb
is your responsibility,

484
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,582
but he made his own choice.

485
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,668
You can't protect everyone.

486
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:53,836
[chuckles]

487
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:55,922
I can't protect anyone.

488
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:57,798
Nobody can.

489
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:01,177
Him leaving isn't your fault.

490
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,596
None of this is your fault.

491
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:05,014
[sighs]

492
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,517
Johanna was right.
You have to forgive yourself.

493
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:17,443
Thank you.

494
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:19,028
[woman on PA] All factions
have been instructed to

495
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:22,240
-maintain a strict curfew
until further notice.
-[Tris] we gotta move.

496
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:25,618
Repeat. All factions
have been instructed

497
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:28,496
to maintain a strict curfew
until further notice.

498
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:32,375
All factions
have been instructed
to maintain a strict curfew...

499
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,433
-We found them.
-Yeah.

500
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:50,977
-[Hector] Four!
-[all greeting]

501
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,899
-Damn, is it good
to see you guys.
-How are you, Uriah?

502
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,818
I'm better now.
I'm not exactly built
for laying low.

503
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:00,820
-Tris!
-Christina.

504
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,616
-It's so good to see you.
-[Christina] You too.

505
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:08,411
Have you heard anything
about Will?

506
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,374
-No.
-Nothing?

507
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:15,084
No.

508
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,461
Something must have happened
to him.

509
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,881
He would have found me
by now, you know?

510
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:24,510
-Hey.
-Hey.

511
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,595
How you holdin' up?

512
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:29,015
How many Dauntless do we have?

513
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,391
Hundred and seventy-five.
Total.

514
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:33,185
-Hundred and seventy-five?
That's it?
-The rest followed Max.

515
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,229
Not near the numbers we need.

516
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,564
-No.
-[man] Hold it!

517
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,941
Drop your guns.

518
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:43,321
-Whoa, hey. They're with us.
-We know who you are.

519
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:46,490
Last warning. Drop your guns.

520
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:50,578
[Four] All right.

521
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:03,632
Easy.

522
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:18,272
I'm Jack Kang.
I'm leadership here.

523
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:19,774
Yeah, we know who you are.

524
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,400
And we're not a threat
to Candor.

525
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:24,195
That might be your truth.
It's not necessarily mine.

526
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:27,114
All I know for certain
is you're both wanted

527
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,116
for criminal insurgency
and conspiring

528
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,035
in the attack on Abnegation.

529
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:35,414
Those are lies.

530
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:38,209
If you were Candor,
I would take you at your word.

531
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,837
Unfortunately,
given the circumstances,

532
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,381
I'm obliged to hand you over
to the Council.

533
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,591
You can make your case there.

534
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:47,510
You might as well
just kill us now.

535
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:50,179
If Jeanine finds us,
we're not gonna live
to stand trial.

536
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:51,847
I doubt that very much.

537
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,099
She would never supersede
the Council.

538
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:56,727
Sure about that?
Who's gonna stop her? You?

539
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,940
Factional law must be upheld.

540
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,942
All right, wait, wait, wait.

541
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:04,860
Can I ask you one question?

542
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,112
[grunts]

543
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,072
Can I ask you one question?

544
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,658
Jeanine believes that Erudite
are most fit to govern

545
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,535
because they are the smartest.

546
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:15,538
Do you believe that Candor
is most fit to judge because
you're so honest?

547
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,750
I admit I do hold that belief.

548
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,752
Then would you say that
a trial held here at Candor

549
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:24,713
would be inherently more fair
than a trial held by Erudite?

550
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:25,798
Hmm.

551
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:30,553
The answer is yes.

552
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,305
In my opinion,
a Candor trial would have

553
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,516
the greatest chance
of achieving true justice.

554
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:37,810
So are you asking me
to petition the Council

555
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:39,311
to grant Candor
sole judiciary power?

556
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,188
No. As part of Candor's
initiation,

557
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,690
you administer a truth serum.

558
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:44,817
Correct?

559
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:49,196
We don't typically discuss
such matters out of faction.

560
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,489
That's a pretty evasive answer.

561
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,824
Evasion is not dishonest.

562
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:53,909
It's not exactly honesty
either.

563
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,872
Yes. We possess such a serum.

564
00:40:58,038 --> 00:40:59,331
Then use it on us.

565
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:01,250
-Four.
-If we're guilty,

566
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:03,210
we'll surrender
to the Council. All right?

567
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,714
If not, you've just saved
two lives.

568
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,299
And made some loyal allies.

569
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:09,967
[Jack] All right.

570
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,595
But you should know that
the serum can be quite brutal.

571
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,763
It was designed
for Candor applicants

572
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,891
who are already
predisposed to honesty.

573
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:20,102
Not everyone finds it so easy
to share their secrets.

574
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:24,857
-Don't wanna do this.
-We have to.

575
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,984
Neither of us have secrets
worth dying for.

576
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:31,030
[indistinct whispering]

577
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:38,787
May the truth set you free.

578
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:44,043
[instrumental music playing]

579
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,303
[breathing heavily]

580
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:57,890
[Jack speaking disorientedly]
Tobias Eaton,

581
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:04,230
you are accused of conspiring
with your fellow Dauntless

582
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:05,981
in the attack on Abnegation.

583
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:08,192
Is this true?

584
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,403
Conspiring, no.

585
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:13,989
But I did attack.

586
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:17,117
I was in a simulation
controlled by Jeanine

587
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,370
and the rest of the Dauntless
that she recruited.

588
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:21,914
Tris found me.

589
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,833
She managed to break me free
from the simulation,

590
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,252
and then together we...

591
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:28,754
Together we fought our way out.

592
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:36,679
So you're saying
that Jeanine orchestrated
this attack?

593
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,474
Yes.

594
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:45,813
One last thing.

595
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:49,942
If you suspected that Jeanine
had corrupted Dauntless,

596
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,735
why didn't you just leave?

597
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,281
Why did you stay?

598
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,449
[breathing heavily]
I wanted to leave.

599
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:01,245
But I fell in love
with Tris Prior.

600
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:06,166
And I couldn't leave her.

601
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:17,052
Thank you for your candor.

602
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,346
[all]
Thank you for your candor.

603
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,765
[Jack]
Tobias Eaton,
this trial is concluded.

604
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:25,311
And you are absolved of guilt
in the attack on Abnegation.

605
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,231
Miss Prior, if you would.

606
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:41,869
May the truth set you free.

607
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,344
Tris Prior,

608
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:02,431
Mr. Eaton said you managed
to free him from the sim.

609
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:06,560
[Tris] Yes.

610
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:09,605
[Jack] So you were never
under the simulation yourself?

611
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:12,399
No.

612
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:15,152
How is that possible?

613
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:18,447
Because I'm Divergent.

614
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:20,115
[people murmuring]

615
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,038
I see.

616
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:32,378
So you never harmed
any of your fellow Dauntless

617
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:33,587
or the Abnegation?

618
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:37,049
[breathing heavily]
I did.

619
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:42,137
Both.

620
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:46,308
Who?

621
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:48,143
[sniffling]

622
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:50,562
My mom.

623
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,232
Um...

624
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,443
I watched her die first.

625
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,029
And then my dad.

626
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:01,740
They were killed
trying to save me.

627
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:07,496
And... I... [straining]

628
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,750
Miss Prior,
the more you resist,

629
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:13,377
the more painful
the serum will be.

630
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,008
[Tris groans]

631
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:21,802
My friend...

632
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,514
I killed my friend.

633
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:30,102
He was trying to shoot me.
And I...

634
00:45:34,731 --> 00:45:37,901
[sobbing]
I shot him first.

635
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:43,907
What was his name?

636
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:46,618
I can't.

637
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:52,082
What was his name?

638
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,211
Will.

639
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:00,340
I killed Will.

640
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,805
'Cause that's what happens

641
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:12,978
to people when they get
close to me.

642
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:23,572
They get hurt or they die.

643
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:27,367
I can't forgive myself.

644
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:32,998
Thank you for your candor.

645
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:35,334
[all]
Thank you for your candor.

646
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:43,884
[sobbing]

647
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:52,184
Tris.

648
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:54,520
Tris.

649
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,941
I'm sorry, all right?

650
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:03,445
-I told you that
I didn't wanna do that.
-Hey...

651
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:16,959
-Christina...
-Go.

652
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:21,380
Go.

653
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:29,388
[woman groaning]

654
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:32,683
[electronic voice]
Abnegation sim complete.

655
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:36,186
Dauntless sim initiating.

656
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:41,775
[man]
Ma'am, the Divergent's
vitals are dropping.

657
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:43,860
If we don't pull her
out of the sim soon,
we'll lose her.

658
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:46,029
You'll stop when I say so.

659
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:53,662
She's gonna do it.

660
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,585
She's gonna pass the sim.

661
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:05,799
[electronic voice]
Dauntless sim failed.

662
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:09,761
[man]
Divergent Test Subject Six
is no longer viable.

663
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:10,846
[sighs]

664
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:14,224
All right, shut it down.

665
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,478
Wasting our time.

666
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,735
I've been assuming that
all Divergents are the same.

667
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:30,157
But some are
much stronger than others.

668
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:36,079
Assign all
non-essential personnel
to the Divergent detail.

669
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:38,040
We need to look harder.

670
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:40,626
We need to find that
very special one.

671
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:02,564
Where's your scary boyfriend?

672
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:08,945
Probably off
doing scary boyfriend things.

673
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:15,619
Mind if I join you?

674
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:22,542
I love heights.

675
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:27,506
From up here, it all just seems
so much smaller, you know?

676
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:30,592
I know it sounds crazy,

677
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:35,514
but sometimes
I think I see lights
out beyond the wall.

678
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:42,062
I know they say it's all just
wasteland out there, but...

679
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:45,607
We can't be the only ones left.

680
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:47,526
-Can we?

00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:53,156
Let's go!

00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:56,243
-Closest weapons?
-Ground floor.

[shushes]

692
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,191
They hurt my mommy?

693
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:53,568
Look, I got one, too.

694
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:56,822
See? It's okay.

695
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,324
It's just the thing that
made everybody go to sleep.

696
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,701
Okay, I need you
to do me a favor.

697
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:04,412
I need you to go to the top
of those stairs up there.

698
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:06,581
Don't come down
until your mommy comes
to get you.

699
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:08,667
-Don't come down?
-Don't come down.

700
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:10,168
Can you do that?

701
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:12,754
Be brave, okay?

702
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:16,007
Okay. Go.

703
00:52:24,724 --> 00:52:25,725

00:52:52,168 --> 00:52:53,295
Hey.

707
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:55,547
Why are we the only ones awake?

708
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:58,800
Because we're Divergents.

709
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:01,595
Come on, I need your help.
We have to open this.

710
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:03,179
Uriah, I need your help.

711
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:07,726
Go.

712
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:10,437
[Eric] Hey!

713
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,899
Look who decided to show up.

714
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,073
It's really good
to see you again.

715
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:32,417
All right, folks.
Nothin' to be nervous about.

716
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:34,961
Just a little
routine inspection.

717
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:37,005
Then we can all go back
to our business.

718
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:40,175
Hello.

719
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:48,016
-[electronic voice]
Divergent, 10 percent.
-Hmm.

720
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:50,101
Shit.

721
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:52,938
You're almost normal.

722
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:54,648
That's boring.

723
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:55,732
-[gunshot]
-[gasps]

724
00:53:57,233 --> 00:53:58,944
That is not
part of the mission.

725
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:00,445
[Eric] So what?

726
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:04,157
Far as I'm concerned
the rest of them
are still outlaws.

727
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:06,826
Let's just
wrap this up quickly.

728
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:09,162
The others
are gonna be awake soon.

729
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:23,677
-Hi, sweetie.
-I shouldn't...

730
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:27,722
[electronic voice]
Divergent, 40 percent.

731
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,724
I'm afraid
it's not you, either.

732
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:33,061
The lady said I shouldn't...

733
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:37,440
The lady said
I shouldn't come downstairs.

734
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:39,985
Guess you should've listened.

735
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:41,903
[Tris grunts]

736
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:53,123
[Max] Enough.
We still have to test her.

737
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:54,541
Eric!

738
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:55,667
[panting]

739
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,711
Jeanine told us
that we have to test everyone.

740
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:00,255
[groans]

741
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:07,971
[electronic voice]
Divergent, 100 percent.

742
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:09,389
I'll be damned.

743
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:12,434
-What?
-She's what
we've been looking for.

744
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:14,060
Bullshit.

745
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:21,568
[electronic voice]
Divergent, 100 percent.

746
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:26,448
Get her in a vehicle.
I'll alert Jeanine.

747
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:34,330
If you think you got lucky,
you're wrong.

748
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:37,542
You're gonna wish I killed you.

749
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:52,640
[man 1] Drop it. Don't move.

750
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:53,933
-Drop your weapon!
-[man 2] Get down.

751
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,393
-Let me see your hands.
-[man 3] Right there!

752
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,112
Hey.

753
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:09,949
Thank you.

754
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:14,454
It's lucky you got
that gun, Four.

755
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:15,538
[sighs]

756
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:19,084
Oh, we both know
you were never much
without one.

757
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:39,104
[screams]

758
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:43,566
[Four grunting]

759
00:56:46,611 --> 00:56:47,821
[Eric groans]

760
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:52,534
You think she's safe now?

761
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:54,452
You're wrong.

762
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:58,039
Jeanine's never gonna stop
searching for you.

763
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:03,795
Why? What does she want
with her?

764
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:06,464
Tell me.

765
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:09,717
Look, all I know is
she's exactly what
Jeanine needs.

766
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,886
She's the perfect subject.

767
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:16,015
[gun cocks]

768
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:17,517
Was that supposed to scare me?

769
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:22,063
You're responsible
for the death
of hundreds of people.

770
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:24,023
You know the punishment
for that.

771
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:25,316
Listen...

772
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:29,696
I've found a way to live
with the blood on my hands.

773
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:31,948
But can you?

774
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:40,707
-[gunshot]
-[body thuds]

775
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:06,107
Why won't they come out?

776
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:08,067
All I know is it put me
in a sleeping sim,

777
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,527
and then I woke up
to all hell breaking loose.

778
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:11,196
Hec! Don't play with it.

779
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:13,865
[indistinct conversations]

780
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:23,166
You all know what this means.

781
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:27,504
Thank you. For helping us.

782
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:29,589
I wish I could do more.

783
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:33,176
I had no idea
Jeanine was capable
of something like this.

784
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:36,346
It's time we fight back.

785
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:37,597
We don't have the numbers.

786
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,893
We will.
Once we get to Factionless.

787
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:45,813
[woman on PA]
Strict curfew
until further notice.

788
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:47,941
[Four] You heard Eric.

789
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:50,109
Jeanine's never gonna stop
coming after you.

790
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:51,861
It's our only option.

791
00:58:58,076 --> 00:58:59,702
[Jeanine] Tris Prior.

792
00:59:00,578 --> 00:59:04,040
Of course. It had to be her.

793
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:06,960
Is she still off the grid?

794
00:59:07,168 --> 00:59:10,088
Yeah. But I think
I found a solution.

795
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:16,469
It's Peter. Right?

796
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:20,139
Yeah. And, Jeanine,
can I just say that
it is truly an honor

797
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:22,058
to finally meet you in person?

798
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:27,188
[Four]
Congratulations, Mother.
You got your war.

799
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:30,817
I know you wish
there was another way.

800
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:32,777
But there isn't.

801
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:37,657
I'm the lesser of two evils.
Is that it?

802
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:44,831
You'd better be.

803
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:46,624
[Jeanine] Tell me,

804
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:49,127
why did you surrender
to Erudite?

805
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:52,297
What do you want?

806
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:56,843
I would like a position
in your regime.

807
00:59:58,511 --> 01:00:01,639
Ideally, I would like
a position with some
advancement opportunities.

808
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:02,849
[chuckles]

809
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:05,310
I may be Dauntless,
but I'm not just a meathead.

810
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:08,438
No offense, Max.

811
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:11,274
[scoffs]

812
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:15,320
Prove your worth to us.

813
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:18,865
Then we can discuss
your ambitions.

814
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:22,785
Great. When do I start?

815
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:25,371
Let's talk about
your friend Tris Prior.

816
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:29,167
How do I flush her out?

817
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:32,003
[Peter] Simple. The girl's
a walking bleeding heart.

818
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:34,297
She was born Abnegation.
That's her weak spot.

819
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:35,840
You just have to know
how to press it.

820
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:37,717
[Lauren] Help! Come quick!

821
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,052
[man]
It's coming from up there.

822
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:41,929
[woman] Christina!
Please, help!

823
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:44,390
-[indistinct conversations]
-Somebody do something!

824
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:47,769
[boy 1] Look!
[boy 2] On the ledge!

825
01:00:48,102 --> 01:00:53,232
[all] The traitor Tris Prior
must be surrendered to Erudite

826
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:56,611
or every day
more deaths will follow.

827
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:01,324
Go!

828
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:03,618
[all] Hand over Tris Prior

829
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:07,288
or every day
more deaths will follow.

830
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:11,584
Hand over Tris Prior

831
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:14,462
or every day
more deaths will follow.

832
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:15,755
[woman] Get down!

833
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:17,465
Hector! No!

834
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,677
[all] Hand over Tris Prior

835
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:23,596
-or every day
more deaths will follow.
-Christina!

836
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:24,806
No!

837
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:26,933
[people gasp]

838
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:29,769
[thud]

839
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:34,607
[panting]

840
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,861
Christina! Christina!

841
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:41,698
[struggling] Tris, help me.

842
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:43,783
Tris!

843
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:51,833
[Christina panting]

844
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:52,917
It's okay.

845
01:02:19,944 --> 01:02:22,155
We removed this
from the body of the suicide.

846
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:26,200
Marlene. Her name was Marlene.

847
01:02:27,326 --> 01:02:30,163
I'm sorry. Marlene.

848
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:33,249
It's a very sophisticated
sim serum injector.

849
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,543
It also has a radio transmitter
in its head.

850
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:37,170
How do we get them out?

851
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:41,090
I don't know.
This tech was built
to defend itself.

852
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:45,762
This tendril wraps around
the nearest major artery.

853
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:50,016
Try to remove them
and they kill the host.

854
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:51,768
[all murmuring]

855
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:57,648
-[Christina] So what do we do?
-Tori has to find a way
to neutralize the disks

856
01:02:57,732 --> 01:02:58,858
before we do anything else.

857
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:00,777
[Edgar]
Or we could do
the logical thing.

858
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:03,529
And we hand her over.

859
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:05,281
Nobody knows
about this alliance.

860
01:03:05,364 --> 01:03:06,866
We have to protect
that advantage.

861
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:11,662
If we hand Tris over now,
might buy us some time.

862
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:13,498
[indistinct chatter]

863
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:22,715
[Four]
I think it's a good idea.

864
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,175
-[woman] Get rid of her!
-Damn right.

865
01:03:24,258 --> 01:03:25,802
Except you'll have to go
through me first.

866
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:28,846
-Me, too.
-[all] And all of us.

867
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:30,431
[all clamoring]

868
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:43,986
Hey! I ain't the one
with the time bomb
in my arm.

869
01:03:45,738 --> 01:03:46,739
[man] Yeah!

870
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:48,783
[all shouting indistinctly]

871
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:09,595
[Tris sniffling]

872
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,310
I know what you're thinking.

873
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:20,815
But I'm not
gonna let you do it.

874
01:04:28,322 --> 01:04:30,283
I can't let anyone else die
because of me.

875
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:33,035
No one else is gonna die
because of you.

876
01:04:33,327 --> 01:04:35,454
Tori's gonna find a way
to disable the disks...

877
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:38,374
-And if she doesn't?
-Then... Then...

878
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:45,047
Then if she doesn't,
we figure it out.

879
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:46,966
Together.

880
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:50,845
You know I'm just one person.

881
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:54,849
I'm not worth it.

882
01:04:54,932 --> 01:04:58,185
No, you are worth it.
You are worth it to me.

883
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:01,480
I love you.

884
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:28,507

885
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:08,524

...plays a critical role in
maintaining the social order.

886
01:07:08,607 --> 01:07:11,527
But this harmony we've achieved
is now under attack.

887
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:15,656
This city may be
safely enclosed
behind a vast wall.

888
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:17,324
But make no mistake,

889
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:21,203
that wall alone
does not ensure our security.

890
01:07:22,663 --> 01:07:25,041
It is up to us,
every one of us,

891
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:28,002
to remain vigilant
in identifying and isolating

892
01:07:28,085 --> 01:07:30,004
any potential threat
to our stability.

893
01:07:30,629 --> 01:07:34,550
There are individuals
hiding among us
who must be contained.

894
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:40,222
So permit me to address
the objections
of my fellow faction leaders.

895
01:07:40,806 --> 01:07:42,600
I am aware that
there have been some concerns

896
01:07:42,683 --> 01:07:44,894
about the unavoidable raid
on Candor.

897
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:49,065
-So let me be clear.
-[alarms blaring]

898
01:07:49,148 --> 01:07:54,862
The harboring of Divergents
by any faction
cannot be tolerated.

899
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:58,657
Very soon,
I will be presenting

900
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:00,993
what I believe to be
no less than a mandate

901
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:03,370
from The Founders themselves.

902
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:05,456
And this will, I have no doubt,

903
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:08,250
validate the measures
I'm taking to keep the peace.

904
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:11,087
And provide the instructions
that will allow us

905
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:15,758
to eradicate
the Divergent crisis,
once and for all.

906
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:32,149
Where are you going?

907
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:34,860
Tris left. She's gone.

908
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:38,781
What? When?

909
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:41,826
-Last night.
-Wait.

910
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:44,453
[gun cocking]

911
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:46,330
Tobias!

912
01:08:46,413 --> 01:08:48,958
People look to you
for leadership.

913
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:50,709
You can't just abandon them.

914
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:56,799
Tobias!

915
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:02,721
[door opens]

916
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:07,685
[Peter] Wow.

917
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:11,730
I have to admit, I'm impressed.

918
01:09:12,898 --> 01:09:14,817
I mean, I knew that
you were dumb,

919
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:17,027
but I didn't think
that you were dumb enough

920
01:09:17,111 --> 01:09:20,906
to actually come down here
and turn yourself in.

921
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:27,830
The killings have to stop.

922
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:32,334
Well, that just goes to show
that you can take the girl
out of Abnegation,

923
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:34,545
but you can't take
the Abnegation outta the girl.

924
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:35,588
Let's go.

925
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:40,050
Once a stiff,
always a stiff, right?

926
01:09:51,145 --> 01:09:52,396
What is this?

927
01:09:52,646 --> 01:09:55,357
What is this?
This is the only reason
why you're alive, Tris.

928
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:57,484
Man, I love knowing stuff
that you don't.

929
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:01,405
Need you to open up
that box, Tris.

930
01:10:07,119 --> 01:10:09,288
The only way to open that box
is to pass the sims

931
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:11,040
of all five factions.

932
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:16,754
But the only people that
have tried to do it so far
have died. [laughing]

933
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:18,297
Oops.

934
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:21,383
I don't think
I was supposed to
tell you that.

935
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:22,885
Oh, well.

936
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:25,888
No pressure.

937
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:28,057
[Jeanine] Remarkable.

938
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:33,270
Chances of it being you,
of all people.

939
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:36,732
Nearly defies
the laws of probability.

940
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:43,656
As remarkable
as the amount of people
you've managed to murder.

941
01:10:45,449 --> 01:10:48,244
Dark times
call for extreme measures.

942
01:10:50,204 --> 01:10:52,539
You may find it
hard to believe,

943
01:10:52,873 --> 01:10:55,125
but I am serving
the greater good.

944
01:10:58,212 --> 01:11:00,631
Step up on the disk, please.

945
01:11:19,316 --> 01:11:20,901

946
01:11:21,402 --> 01:11:23,696

01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:32,663
Ma'am?

950
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:34,581
-Hmm?
-[Peter groaning]

951
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:40,796
Oh.

952
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:44,383
Stop the suicides
or I swear I will shoot him.

953
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:48,429
That's okay.
You can kill him if you want.
We have plenty of guards.

954
01:11:50,764 --> 01:11:52,141
What?

I'm guessing you need me alive
for this to work.

959
01:12:34,641 --> 01:12:35,559
Right?

960
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:39,813
[shouts] Right?

961
01:12:52,493 --> 01:12:53,702
[Caleb] Beatrice.

962
01:12:57,456 --> 01:12:58,540
Caleb.

963
01:13:00,292 --> 01:13:02,002

964
01:13:03,087 --> 01:13:06,215
-I--
-Don't engage the subject.

965
01:13:07,257 --> 01:13:09,927
Conditions are already
less than optimal.

966
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:19,436
Oh, my God.

967
01:13:30,781 --> 01:13:33,242
If I do this,
the suicides stop?

968
01:13:35,828 --> 01:13:39,706
No. The suicides will continue

969
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:43,460
until you succeed
and pass all five sims.

970
01:13:45,003 --> 01:13:47,297
Should be incentive enough.

971
01:13:50,843 --> 01:13:52,094
Good luck.

I'm trying.

You can do this.
I know you can.

You're brave.
Braver than anyone.

1013

I'm not brave, Mom.

I pretend that I am.

1015
01:19:29,598 --> 01:19:32,726
And I want people
to think that I am,
but I'm not.

I never wanted any of this.

You and Dad and Caleb
and then Four.

And I can't help but think
that if I was normal,

we would all still be together.

a Divergent anymore.

You weren't there.
You didn't even hear that.

all right?

01:22:01,958 --> 01:22:03,293
I'm sorry, Four.

that I was gonna go.

I didn't get to say it

if I was in a sim?

Wait, wait.

1064
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:17,492
[electronic voice]
Erudite sim complete.

1065
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:20,328
[Jeanine]
There's only Amity now.

1066
01:23:20,662 --> 01:23:22,163
[Peter]
She hasn't passed
Abnegation yet.

1067
01:23:22,372 --> 01:23:25,792
Yes, she has.
When she spared your life.

1068
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:29,295
This girl is extraordinary.

1069
01:23:30,171 --> 01:23:33,383
She's tested positive
for four factions in one day.

1070
01:23:33,675 --> 01:23:34,676
[chuckles]

1071
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:37,137
No one's gotten that far.

1072
01:23:37,387 --> 01:23:38,388
[machine beeping]

1073
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:40,432
[man] We've got a problem.

1074
01:23:45,770 --> 01:23:47,897
She's crashing.
We have to rest her.

1075
01:23:48,982 --> 01:23:51,901
Sure you're not letting
familial attachment
cloud your judgment?

1076
01:23:52,277 --> 01:23:53,445
See for yourself.

1077
01:23:56,948 --> 01:23:58,241
[panting]

1078
01:24:02,078 --> 01:24:03,246
Very well.

1079
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,374
Detach the subject.

1080
01:24:18,386 --> 01:24:21,264
Good work, everyone.
We'll resume tomorrow.

1081
01:24:50,752 --> 01:24:52,253
[door opens]

1082
01:25:04,224 --> 01:25:07,393
You were never planning on
going back to Abnegation,
were you?

1083
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:11,856
I had to do
what I felt was right.

1084
01:25:13,191 --> 01:25:15,235
Our parents
would be ashamed of you.

1085
01:25:16,486 --> 01:25:17,862
Well, maybe not.

1086
01:25:20,031 --> 01:25:22,158
I mean, I am willing
to sacrifice you,

1087
01:25:23,159 --> 01:25:25,745
the only family I have left,
the only person I love,

1088
01:25:25,829 --> 01:25:28,081
in order to preserve
what's best for everyone else.

1089
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,085
What's more selfless than that?

1090
01:25:41,469 --> 01:25:44,139
What does Jeanine think
is in that box, Caleb?

1091
01:25:44,931 --> 01:25:46,391
It's a message
from The Founders.

1092
01:25:46,474 --> 01:25:47,934
But the box was to be opened

1093
01:25:48,017 --> 01:25:50,478
only if the Faction System
broke down,

1094
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:52,981
which is why it requires
someone like you to open it.

1095
01:25:54,315 --> 01:25:56,776
You are living proof
that the Divergent problem

1096
01:25:56,860 --> 01:25:58,695
has grown beyond all control.

1097
01:25:59,696 --> 01:26:01,906
Do you even hear
what you're saying right now?

1098
01:26:03,324 --> 01:26:05,827
No one thinks it's your fault
that you were born this way.

1099
01:26:05,910 --> 01:26:08,163
Jeanine murdered
an entire faction, Caleb.

1100
01:26:08,329 --> 01:26:10,123
That faction
could no longer be trusted.

1101
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:12,000
She killed our parents.

1102
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:14,085
Our parents brought that
on themselves.

1103
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:15,628
What are you talking about?

1104
01:26:17,213 --> 01:26:18,339
The box?

1105
01:26:18,464 --> 01:26:20,800
It was in their house.
They were the ones hiding it.

1106
01:26:21,259 --> 01:26:22,927
All of those lives
could have been spared.

1107
01:26:25,388 --> 01:26:28,433
Seems we didn't know
our parents as well
as we thought we did.

1108
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:30,560
[door opens]

1109
01:26:31,102 --> 01:26:33,730
All right.
Family reunion's over.
It's time to go.

1110
01:26:41,696 --> 01:26:43,448
I got a little surprise
for you, Tris.

1111
01:26:47,785 --> 01:26:49,746
-[Tris] Four?
-Tris!

1112
01:26:50,163 --> 01:26:52,790
-Tris! Tris!
-Four! Four!

1113
01:26:53,082 --> 01:26:55,293
-Tris!
-Four! Four!

1114
01:26:55,835 --> 01:26:57,795
Stop! Four!

1115
01:26:57,879 --> 01:26:59,005
Four!

1116
01:26:59,631 --> 01:27:02,175
[screaming]
Stop, stop!

1117
01:27:02,383 --> 01:27:03,593
[Tris groaning]

1118
01:27:07,013 --> 01:27:09,557
I gather your brother
explained to you how vital

1119
01:27:09,641 --> 01:27:11,809
the work you're doing here
is to the future of this city?

1120
01:27:11,976 --> 01:27:13,228
Please, just let Four go.

1121
01:27:15,188 --> 01:27:16,940
If his well-being
is of such concern

1122
01:27:17,023 --> 01:27:19,984
then you should focus
on the task at hand.

1123
01:27:21,569 --> 01:27:22,737
[Jeanine sighs]

1124
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:25,198
Tell me,
do you appreciate irony?

1125
01:27:27,158 --> 01:27:28,701
You tested positive
for Erudite,

1126
01:27:28,785 --> 01:27:31,079
so you must have
the intellectual capacity.

1127
01:27:31,287 --> 01:27:32,413
Irony?

1128
01:27:32,497 --> 01:27:34,999
For instance, right now
you're filled with hate.

1129
01:27:35,083 --> 01:27:37,085
But you need to pass
an Amity sim.

1130
01:27:39,671 --> 01:27:40,755
[laughing]

1131
01:27:41,965 --> 01:27:44,634
Then there are other ironies
at work, too.

1132
01:27:44,884 --> 01:27:47,345
-Such as the fact that
your cherished mother--
-Don't.

1133
01:27:47,428 --> 01:27:49,597
Who you so dauntlessly saved
in the sim

1134
01:27:49,681 --> 01:27:51,474
is the reason you're
in this mess to begin with.

1135
01:27:51,557 --> 01:27:52,850
You're the reason
I'm in this mess.

1136
01:27:52,976 --> 01:27:55,436
Then there's
the most poignant irony
of all...

1137
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:58,356
-Stop.
-That Natalie Prior
not only died

1138
01:27:58,439 --> 01:28:00,942
trying to protect the data that
I now have in my possession.

1139
01:28:01,025 --> 01:28:02,819
Because you stole it from her.
You killed her for it!

1140
01:28:02,944 --> 01:28:05,571
Data that she
so selfishly withheld.

1141
01:28:05,655 --> 01:28:09,701
But her own daughter.
Her beloved Divergent Tris

1142
01:28:09,784 --> 01:28:12,537
-is going to be the one
to deliver it to me.
-I said stop!

1143
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:15,707
Therefore, your mother's death,

1144
01:28:15,915 --> 01:28:18,042
just like
your boyfriend's death,

1145
01:28:18,126 --> 01:28:20,712
will mean absolutely nothing.

1146
01:28:21,212 --> 01:28:23,673
[rumbling]

1147
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:31,074
Don't pull her out.

1148
01:29:32,075 --> 01:29:33,117
Not yet.

1149
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,001
[Jeanine] No.

1150
01:30:25,086 --> 01:30:26,087
No.

1151
01:30:28,005 --> 01:30:29,465
Bring her back!

1152
01:30:32,468 --> 01:30:33,970
Bring her back!

1153
01:30:34,971 --> 01:30:36,472
No!

1154
01:30:37,223 --> 01:30:39,892
Bring her back! Come on!

1155
01:30:40,518 --> 01:30:41,602
Come on.

1156
01:30:41,894 --> 01:30:42,895
Come on.

1157
01:30:46,023 --> 01:30:47,024
Bring her back!

1158
01:30:47,108 --> 01:30:49,318
[man on PA]
Test Subject Seven
is no longer viable.

[whispering]
I really thought
you were the one.

1161
01:31:27,690 --> 01:31:28,858
We'll just...

1162
01:31:32,195 --> 01:31:35,281
We'll just have to resume
our search.

1163
01:31:50,588 --> 01:31:52,632
Find solace
in your faction, Caleb.

1164
01:31:53,382 --> 01:31:54,550
We're your family now.

1165
01:32:42,098 --> 01:32:43,808
Jeanine wanted me
to show you this.

1166
01:33:03,953 --> 01:33:04,954

1167

1168
01:33:13,546 --> 01:33:16,090
Hey, Four.
Maybe do that thing you do?

1169
01:33:16,966 --> 01:33:18,301
[all grunting]

1170
01:33:22,179 --> 01:33:24,557
[Peter] Hey, Four, come on,
that was pretty good, right?

1171
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:26,684
First, I swiped a paralytic
from the infirmary.

1172
01:33:26,767 --> 01:33:28,853
Then I shot her up
when she was all
freakin' out about you.

1173
01:33:29,895 --> 01:33:31,480
I mean, I told these guys
I was pretty smart.

1174
01:33:31,564 --> 01:33:32,732
Guess they should've listened.

1175
01:33:38,487 --> 01:33:39,572
You're real.

1176
01:33:41,198 --> 01:33:42,450
Yeah, I'm real.

1177
01:33:44,785 --> 01:33:46,078
What are you doing here?

1178
01:33:48,205 --> 01:33:49,373
You die, I die.

1179
01:33:52,710 --> 01:33:54,712
Okay, guys, come on.

1180
01:33:54,795 --> 01:33:57,423
Let's go, seriously.
We can do that later.

1181
01:33:58,382 --> 01:33:59,800
-It's okay.
-Yeah.

1182
01:34:00,343 --> 01:34:02,011
[panting]

1183
01:34:04,138 --> 01:34:07,183
-Thank you, Peter.
-Yeah, whatever.
Now we're even, stiff.

1184
01:34:07,516 --> 01:34:09,435
All right. Come on, let's go.

1185
01:34:09,518 --> 01:34:10,853
Before Jeanine realizes
you're still alive.

1186
01:34:10,936 --> 01:34:12,688
-No, no, no.
-What?

1187
01:34:12,772 --> 01:34:13,814
The box.
We have to get the box.

1188
01:34:14,023 --> 01:34:16,150
What, are you kidding me?
Now's not the time
for a souvenir, Tris.

1189
01:34:16,233 --> 01:34:17,568
Four, you have to listen to me.

1190
01:34:17,651 --> 01:34:18,861
It's not what
Jeanine thinks it is.

1191
01:34:18,944 --> 01:34:21,322
I know it's not. My mother
would have destroyed it.

1192
01:34:22,239 --> 01:34:23,407
We have to get it.

1193
01:34:27,244 --> 01:34:28,788
Peter, is there
another way into the lab?

1194
01:34:30,039 --> 01:34:32,666
I mean, I'd have to go
into the control room
to disable all the doors.

1195
01:34:32,750 --> 01:34:33,959
Okay, good, then do that.

1196
01:34:36,921 --> 01:34:38,672
-Okay. Right now?
-Yeah.

1197
01:34:38,756 --> 01:34:41,008
You just chose our side,
whether you meant to or not.

1198
01:34:41,092 --> 01:34:43,177
If you wanna survive,
make sure we do.

1199
01:34:44,470 --> 01:34:45,513
Let's go.

Ma'am, our current assessment
with other possible candidates.

1204

[Jeanine] Correct. Female.

And we have the two males
introduced to you before.

1206

No guns. It'll draw
too much attention.

I can't. I can't.

I have to open it for her

Tris, if we don't leave now,
we're not gonna get outta here.

1237

You killed Will.
And your parents.

You're deadly.

1265

That's enough!

1266
01:39:46,855 --> 01:39:48,732
No one's gonna love you, Tris.

They're never even

This world will be

I come from outside the wall.

1284
01:41:29,833 --> 01:41:32,252
Where we have all
but destroyed each other.

1285
01:41:34,129 --> 01:41:36,840
We designed your city
as an experiment.

1286
01:41:37,591 --> 01:41:41,804
We believe it is the only way
to recover the humanity
we have lost.

1287
01:41:44,431 --> 01:41:47,893
And we created factions
to ensure peace.

1288
01:41:49,061 --> 01:41:51,188
But we believe there will be
those among you

1289
01:41:51,271 --> 01:41:54,191
who will transcend
these factions.

1290
01:41:54,983 --> 01:41:56,527
These will be the Divergent.

1291
01:41:59,029 --> 01:42:01,698
They are the true purpose
of this experiment.

1292
01:42:01,949 --> 01:42:05,619
They are vital
to humanity's survival.

then at least one of you

has succeeded.
