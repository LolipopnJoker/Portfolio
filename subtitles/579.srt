All this NBA dick

you need to say to her

1966
01:33:07,665 --> 01:33:09,250
that you can't
say in front of us.

1967
01:33:09,334 --> 01:33:10,335
Mmm-hmm.

1968
01:33:15,965 --> 01:33:18,259
It's okay. It's okay.

1969
01:33:20,637 --> 01:33:22,388
We'll wait for you
downstairs.

1970
01:33:24,641 --> 01:33:25,934
Here, take my stun gun.

1971
01:33:26,017 --> 01:33:28,478
Now, this button right here,
it raises the voltage of it.

you know what, fuck it.

I'm gonnajust leave
it on high, all right?

1974
01:33:32,357 --> 01:33:34,692
Just tag him right in the
balls if he do something.

1975
01:33:36,778 --> 01:33:39,197
Both balls. Dick, t00.

1976
01:33:49,624 --> 01:33:51,251
I spoke with Simone.

1977
01:33:54,587 --> 01:33:56,965
She agreed to sign an NDA

1978
01:33:57,048 --> 01:34:00,093
in exchange for a monthly
payment for her and the baby.

1979
01:34:00,385 --> 01:34:01,719
I could

1980
01:34:02,512 --> 01:34:03,596
kill you.

1981
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:05,890
Iam so furious right now.

every right to be.

love me anymore?

1984
01:34:17,235 --> 01:34:18,653
Of course I do.

1985
01:34:18,736 --> 01:34:22,198
I made a terrible mistake.

1986
01:34:23,867 --> 01:34:27,162
I know you can't trust me
as your husband anymore.

1987
01:34:28,538 --> 01:34:30,915
But you can trust
me as your partner.

1988

This deal will
set us up for life.

1989

But we can't do it apart.

Ryan without Stewart

shit about people for a living?
