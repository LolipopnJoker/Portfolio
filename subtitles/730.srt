Hello.

305
00:18:20,962 --> 00:18:22,862
What've you got there?

306
00:18:22,864 --> 00:18:27,801
Oh, uh... It's yours.
I found it in the attic.

307
00:18:27,803 --> 00:18:31,675
It has loads of things
from when you were my age.

308
00:18:33,742 --> 00:18:35,743
Haycorns.

309
00:18:35,745 --> 00:18:37,781
I mean, acorns.

310
00:18:39,782 --> 00:18:42,049
Nothing of any great
importance.

you should be doing something

more useful with your time?

314
00:18:46,822 --> 00:18:47,854

the book list

I've been very efficient.

318
00:18:54,697 --> 00:18:57,130

to do this weekend.

We'll go back to your cottage.

320

board games.

322
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,607
