1
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:24,500
Oh, my God!

2
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:34,343
Frank, thank God! I'm dead.

3
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:37,305
I'm dead.

4
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:41,810
Frank, I'm sorry. I got lost.
This town is so confusing.

5
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:44,520
It's Connecticut,
Vermon, Massachusetts

6
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:51,903
Man, What a day.
My wife had to work early.

7
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:55,695
So I took my kid to his new
school, we wont stop crying.

8
00:01:55,696 --> 00:01:58,367
He said he wants to
move back to Chicago.

9
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:04,248
- It broke my heart, Frank.
- Any more excuses?

10
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:05,968
No.

11
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:09,670
Good. When you work with
me, you be punctual.

12
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,884
- You got it?
- I'm sorry Frank. It won't happen again.

13
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,903
- Frank, how are you doing?
- It's good to see you again.

14
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:36,022
Hi, Marty. Sorry we're late.

15
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:39,784
Al, could go downstairs and
help out Jimmy and Raul.

16
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:44,914
Yeah, sure. Appreciate it.
This is his.

17
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:54,090
- You don't trust me?
- I live in a crappy neighbourhood.

18
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:58,970
- You got that funny money?
- Yeah. Right here.

19
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:04,809
It looks good. Looks real good.

20
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:10,398
- Now we're in business.
- Excellent.

21
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:15,236
There's just one problem.
Know this guy Al. ...

22
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:18,555
He keeps asking all these
questions about my counterfeiter.

23
00:03:18,556 --> 00:03:20,783
- Really?
- Yeah he asked me too many question

24
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:25,288
Now, my instinct usually tells me
when something's wrong.

25
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:30,710
And there's something wrong here.
So I had him followed.

26
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:34,797
He's a fucking Secret
Service agent, Frank.

27
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:52,717
What do you think I
ought to do, Frank?

28
00:03:52,718 --> 00:03:55,985
Make sure the body doesn't
wash up on shore.

29
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:01,365
I want you to pop him for me, okay?

30
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:09,290
- I think maybe you're with him.
- Look, you came to me, remember?

31
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:14,128
- So pop him. Show me I'm an asshole.
- I'm just a businessman.

32
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:16,213
So pop him...

33
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:19,383
...and let's do some business.

34
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,321
Yes, Frank, that's what I'm looking for.

35
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,893
Come on, let's go
get an omelette.

36
00:04:43,894 --> 00:04:46,285
You like omelette Frank?
I know a good place

37
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,207
Let me get my pistol.

38
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:54,043
My gun?

39
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,051
You're under arrest.

40
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:14,063
You're under arrest, too.
Secret Service.

41
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:20,460
You knew the gun
was empty, right?

42
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:26,351
You knew from the weight of the gun
that the chamber was empty, am I right?

43
00:05:26,352 --> 00:05:28,832
Well there could have
been one bullet there.

44
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:29,452
Oh my god.

45
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,124
Hey, Frank.

46
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:39,630
Frank, do you think we can go
someplace and talk about this?

47
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,685
You killed guys before, Frank?

48
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,522
Does it get to you?

49
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,733
It gets to you.

50
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,421
I don't think I cut out for
this undercover stuff.

51
00:06:04,422 --> 00:06:05,990
Man, I was so scared.

52
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:12,913
You know I joined
the Secret Service because. . .

53
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,793
...I've always wanted
to protect people.

54
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:21,797
The idea of throwing
yourself in front of a gun?

55
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,208
Hoping like hell that
the bullet hit you

56
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:26,983
instead of the guy you're protecting?
You find that appealing?

57
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:33,142
I don't know. Maybe I'm....

58
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:40,483
- Maybe I'm just wrong for the job.
- You're a good man, Al.

59
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,365
You'll make a good agent.

60
00:06:42,366 --> 00:06:46,481
How do you know? This the longest
conversation we ever had

61
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,994
I know things about people.

62
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:57,095
Come on, let's go get
something to eat.

63
00:06:57,096 --> 00:07:00,628
Nah. I want to got home,
hug my wife and kid

64
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,630
You know when I got into
town, a lot of guys

65
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,216
warned me you were
a pain in the ass.

66
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:06,050
And they were right

67
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:10,221
- I'lI see you in the office.
- Oh damn! The office.

68
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:14,054
Monroe wants us to
check out some wacko

69
00:07:14,055 --> 00:07:15,976
I'lI take care of it.

70
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,591
I'lI go with you.

71
00:07:17,592 --> 00:07:20,981
No. You go home, hug
your wife and kid.

72
00:07:27,311 --> 00:07:32,868
I am not a nosy lady. I don't snoop,
but the smoke alarm was going off.

73
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:36,455
I get scared.

74
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:42,253
I got more scared when
I see what is there inside.

75
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:51,178
The smoke was from crumbs
in the oven he left on.

76
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:21,750
Thirty-one years
Iim in this country.

77
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:26,505
I love the United States.
I go to White House.

78
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:33,637
Only United States can just anybody go
to the house of the President to visit.

79
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:38,726
So when I see this,
these killing things.. .

80
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:43,814
... I called the police. They said,
they called the Secret Service.

81
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,901
But two days you don't come.

82
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:53,149
Well the President gets
1,400 threats a year ma'am.

83
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,284
We've got to check them all.

84
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,345
You say his name's McCauley?

85
00:09:05,346 --> 00:09:08,923
Joseph McCrawley, from
Colorado, Denver.

86
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:18,557
I still remember it like yesterday.
I cried and cried.

87
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:03,394
- Joseph McCrawley, Denver. Right?
- That's right

88
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:08,023
Died over 30 years ago, age 11 .

89
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,526
Your guy must've got himself
a duplicate birth certificate. . .

90
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:13,404
...then used it to get a driver's licence.

91
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,700
- Thanks, Jack.
- See you.

92
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:24,873
Federal Agents. Open up!

93
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:21,930
Oh, my God! That's you.

94
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:34,670
- Yeah?
<i>- Frank Horrigan?</i>

95
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:39,508
- Yeah?
<i>- The Secret Service agent?</i>

96
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:44,680
- Yeah. What did I win?
<i>- My God, it's really you?</i>

97
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:50,686
- Who the hell is this?
<i>- That was you in my apartment last night.</i>

98
00:12:57,068 --> 00:13:02,156
- McCrawley?
<i>- Why not call me Booth?</i>

99
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:06,869
- Why not Oswald?
<i>- Booth had flair and panache.</i>

100
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:11,540
<i>He leap to the stage</i>
<i>after he shot Lincoln.</i>

101
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:17,796
- Where are you?
<i>- Closer than you'd imagine.</i>

102
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:21,542
<i>It's very exciting to talk to you.
I feel like I know you.</i>

103
00:13:21,543 --> 00:13:22,426
How's that?

104
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:26,363
<i>I've read about you and seen photos.
You were JFK's favourite agent.</i>

105
00:13:26,364 --> 00:13:27,806
<i>The best and the brightest</i>

106
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:32,394
<i>But that was a long time ago.</i>
<i>What kept you in the game all these years?</i>

107
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:36,134
Why don't we get together and
have a drink, we can talk about that.

108
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:39,326
<i> I'd love to but I think the less
you know about me, the better.</i>

109
00:13:39,327 --> 00:13:40,110
Why?

110
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:43,592
<i> Because I'm planning
to kill the President.</i>

111
00:13:43,593 --> 00:13:46,033
Now you shouldn't
go and said that.

112
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,615
It's a federal offence
to threat the President

113
00:13:48,616 --> 00:13:51,038
you could go to jail even
if you don't mean it.

114
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,916
<i>I mean it all.</i>

115
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,539
<i>JFK once said, all someone
needs is willingness </i>

116
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,923
<i>to trade his life for
the President's, right?</i>

117
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:05,761
- That's right.
<i>- I'm willing.</i>

118
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:11,141
<i>and going up against you, this raises</i>
<i>the game to a much higher level.</i>

119
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:16,647
<i>Fate has brought us together, Frank.</i>

120
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:23,111
<i>- I just can't get over the irony.</i>
- What irony?

121
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:28,408
<i>You being intimate involvement with</i>
<i>the assassinations of two presidents.</i>

122
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,459
Hang on a second will you.
I've got something on the stove.

123
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,889
He was owning the bulding
for three weeks.

124
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,828
He came and left about
and hour afterward

125
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:15,473
What's really weird is that
other tenants notice him,

126
00:15:15,474 --> 00:15:18,041
they pass him oin the stairs
but never really saw him.

127
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:22,170
I mean depending on who you're
talking to, he is between 5'8" and 6'2".

128
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:26,341
Between 165 and 180 pounds.

129
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:30,345
- Age?
- Between 28 and 45.

130
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:44,067
Before an election, panic is what
you've got on a good day. I think...

131
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,195
- They're been waiting for you.
- Hey, Frank.

132
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:47,980
Sam.

133
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:50,449
It's been a long time since anyone
seeing you in this part of the building.

134
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,157
Well, I hear the new
director isn't much fun.

135
00:15:54,158 --> 00:15:56,863
I've been the director
for almost two years.

136
00:15:56,864 --> 00:15:57,539
Yeah

137
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:01,118
Al D'Andrea. Director.
Frank, you know Matt Wilder.

138
00:16:01,119 --> 00:16:01,960
- Yeah. Matt
- Frank

139
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:06,006
He still owes me $20 from Super
Bowl 21. He always like Denver

140
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:09,093
This is agent-in-charge,
Bill Watts.

141
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:10,628
- Bill
- and LilIy Raines.

142
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:11,011
- Hello
- Lilly

143
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,763
Secretary's getting prettier
and prettier around here

144
00:16:14,764 --> 00:16:17,059
And field agents
get old and older

145
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:19,561
Lilly's an agent Frank.

146
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:24,191
I know that, I just wanted to see
if she had a sense of humour.

147
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,236
Have a seat.
Let's talk about this guy.

148
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:31,874
I guess we're calling
him Booth for now.

149
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:32,741
Yeah

150
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:37,621
- Alright. What do you know about him?
- Well, he's dangerous.

151
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:42,501
- How do you know?
- I know things about people Lily

152
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,970
Might I ask why didn't
you take appropriate

153
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:46,922
steps to know more
that first night?

154
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:51,301
- Well we had a busy day Bill
- Too busy to investigate properly?

155
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,279
Your report said, you were
only in the room 10 minutes

156
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,765
I didn't have a warrant.

157
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:59,833
Given your reputation for
undercover work, I wont take...

158
00:16:59,834 --> 00:17:01,685
What reputation are you
talking about Bill?

159
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,277
Alright, let's get
back on track.

160
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:05,458
I like to know what
reputation he's referring to?

161
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:06,112
Let's drop it!

162
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:09,111
Am I being paranoid,
or is he busting my balIs?

163
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:12,197
Probably a little of both.

164
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:18,620
You know Bill, there was a time around here
when I was almost as arrogant as you.

165
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:25,293
I don't have time for this. I've got
to pull 75 agents out of Miami.

166
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:29,256
Keep me posted, Sam, will you?

167
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:37,931
- So what do we do with this guy?
- We keep investigating.

168
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:39,962
Mean while if you can
have my phone tap

169
00:17:39,963 --> 00:17:41,601
What makes you think
he call again?

170
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:46,440
- He'll call again. He's got panache.
- Panache?

171
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,819
- Yes, it means flamboyance.
- I know what it means.

172
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:55,782
- Really? I had to look it up.
- All right, we'll tap your phone.

173
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,991
By the way Frank,
Watts no where near

174
00:17:58,992 --> 00:18:02,354
as arrogant as you were
when you had Kenedy's rear.

175
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:12,048
Just what reputation was Watts
referring to, Sam?

176
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,968
You know damn well

177
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,596
Is it because I'm considered
a borderline burn-out...

178
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:22,184
...with questionable social skills?

179
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:27,856
So what do you want to talk to me
about, besides your reputation?

180
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:31,610
I want to be assigned
to the President.

181
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,527
- Protection?
- That's right

182
00:18:33,528 --> 00:18:37,157
After all these years?
Frank, Christ, you're a dinosaur.

183
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,974
This guy's gonna make a try
and I got to be there.

184
00:18:40,975 --> 00:18:42,871
Watts will fight me to the nail

185
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,899
Then fight him back. You owe it to me
after 30 years doing you favours.

186
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,327
If you knew how many times
I protected your job.

187
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:50,712
I've got to come back Sam

188
00:18:55,635 --> 00:19:01,515
Do you really want to stand
post again Frank? At your age?

189
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:04,681
Yeah, I've got at least
one pair of good

190
00:19:04,682 --> 00:19:07,854
shoes in the back of
the closet somewhere.

191
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:09,624
All post, from Watts. We're stopping.
Traveller wants to work the ropes.

192
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,961
<i>The French President's going with him.</i>
<i>Get a security man up here.</i>

193
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:40,322
God damn it! Get back.

194
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:08,308
- What's going on here?
- Horrigan had a heart attack.

195
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:17,025
- Hey pal, are you okay?
- Get the hell out of here.

196
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:21,446
- What's the hell is going on?
- I had a call about a cardiac case.

197
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:26,117
- Are you all right, Frank?
- I'm on my break here.

198
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:29,537
I get it, you bastards.

199
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:33,500
Who's the wise guy?

200
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:37,379
Okay, everybody, back to work.

201
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,656
All right, who was the joker
who called those guys?

202
00:21:44,657 --> 00:21:46,388
It may not have been a joke.

203
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,975
You were looking a
bit peaked today.

204
00:21:48,976 --> 00:21:52,769
Well if I find it who it is,
I'lI pay him back in spades.

205
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:56,564
How can you be sure it was a him?

206
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:07,993
- Hey, you've missed my street, Al.
- Oh Frank, why don't you have a car?

207
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:12,288
I lived in New York a lot of years.
I like public transportation.

208
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:16,584
You like buses, that's great Frank,
why make me go out of my way?

209
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:20,422
I like your company.

210
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:27,679
- He's a weird-looking guy. Isn't he?
- lf he still looks like that.

211
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:34,102
PulI up over here. Will you?

212
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,232
<i>The President's political
troubles were hardly</i>

213
00:23:08,233 --> 00:23:10,889
<i>apparent around restaurant road
downtown at noon time today.</i>

214
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:13,586
<i>The motorcade with the
French President stopped</i>

215
00:23:13,587 --> 00:23:16,436
<i>twice so the man could greet
the enthusiastic crowds.</i>

216
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:19,245
<i>It remain to be seen whether
the Senate would react as</i>

217
00:23:19,246 --> 00:23:22,317
<i>favourly due to the new trade
agreement of the two leader side.</i>

218
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:25,744
<i>Mean while the French embassador
will host a formal dinner</i>

219
00:23:25,745 --> 00:23:28,948
<i>at the embassy to resuficate
for the President function.</i>

220
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:32,285
<i>and the Presidential political
advisors are said to be very pleased...</i>

221
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:35,342
<i>...with the French willing
to make a point in thanking</i>

222
00:23:35,343 --> 00:23:37,878
<i>the President so publicity
in an election year.</i>

223
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,792
It's a weird sub-culture, Al.

224
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:44,888
I like you to send some field
agents to check this things

225
00:23:44,888 --> 00:23:46,121
Ask about some wackos.

226
00:23:46,122 --> 00:23:48,747
Yeah. Sure first thing in the morning.
I'll check them Frank.

227
00:23:48,748 --> 00:23:49,932
I'll talk to Jack about it.

228
00:23:49,933 --> 00:23:52,889
Hang on, I've got
the other line.

229
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:58,019
- Yeah?
- Frank.

230
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:07,278
- Booth? How are you doing?
- I'm fine, thanks.

231
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:11,533
Hang on a second let me
get rid of the other call

232
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:12,810
You got it?

233
00:24:12,811 --> 00:24:16,914
We got it, Frank, keep him on
the line while we get the ANI.

234
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:22,710
- Yeah?
<i>- Trying to trace me Frank?</i>

235
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,097
Why didn't I think of that?

236
00:24:25,098 --> 00:24:28,967
You did or you're not an
adversary I hoped for

237
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:33,480
Speaking of which how are you?
I was worried about you today.

238
00:24:33,481 --> 00:24:34,556
Why?

239
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:39,519
In the motorcade, I thought
you were going to pass out.

240
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:43,565
You should get in shape
for that kind of duty.

241
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:50,071
<i>- Yeah, maybe you're right.</i>
- By the way, I'm watching your movie.

242
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:56,244
- Movie?
<i>- November '63. Kennedy's last days.</i>

243
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,330
<i>The arrival in Texas.</i>

244
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:03,751
<i>It must have been exciting
for you Fank.</i>

245
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:09,007
<i>Dallas. That morning at Love Field.</i>

246
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:14,929
<i>You all look so radiant.</i>
<i>JFK, Jackie and you.</i>

247
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:18,600
<i>You look so young and able, Frank.</i>

248
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,769
<i>What did happen to you that day?</i>

249
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:27,901
<i>Only one agent reacted to the gun fire
and you were closer to Kennedy than he was.</i>

250
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,809
<i>You must have looked
up at that window,</i>

251
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:34,115
<i>the Texas book depository
but you didn't react.</i>

252
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:38,620
<i>Later at night when the demons come...</i>

253
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,890
<i>...do you see the rifle
coming out of that window,</i>

254
00:25:41,891 --> 00:25:44,872
<i>or did you see Kennedy's
head being blown apart?</i>

255
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:48,746
<i>If you'd reacted to
that first shot,</i>

256
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:52,258
<i>Could you got there in time
to stop the big bullet?</i>

257
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:58,806
<i> and If you had, that could've been</i>
<i>your head that being blown apart.</i>

258
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:04,646
<i>Do you wish you'd succeeded, Frank?</i>
<i>or is life too precious?</i>

259
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:07,440
What's done is done, Booth.

260
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:12,362
I have that Esquire article
on the tenth anniversary. . .

261
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:15,114
...about you and the other
agents over there that day.

262
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:21,120
So sad how your wife left you
and took your little daughter.

263
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:26,125
and you were so forthright
about your drinking problem.

264
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:29,337
<i>And the fact that you weren't
easy to live with.</i>

265
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:33,341
I was so moved by your honesty.

266
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:38,846
The worId can be a cruel place
to an honest man. Frank

267
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:42,809
What about you, Booth?
What's your story?

268
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:46,646
It's an epic saga.

269
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:52,151
I'll talk to you again soon.
It's nice to have a friend.

270
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:02,453
- Did you get him?
- We got him.

271
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:26,025
He could have a device
manipulates the ANI

272
00:27:26,026 --> 00:27:30,690
and fake the caller ID make he seem
like he's calling from another number

273
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:33,224
This device, where
would he get it?

274
00:27:33,225 --> 00:27:36,321
He could build one if he has
knowledgable in digital circuitory

275
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,270
But you can't you
trace the call?

276
00:27:38,271 --> 00:27:41,385
We could run a comparity check.
If he was online with digital switches.

277
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:43,707
You mean, you can
trace the call?

278
00:27:43,708 --> 00:27:46,247
Not if he's on an old
twisted para-analog line, no.

279
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:48,740
Damn it, Jack will you
give me a straight answer,

280
00:27:48,741 --> 00:27:51,252
or I'm going to have my partner
to shoot off his foot.

281
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:55,118
Okay. If he calls again,
you keep him on the line.

282
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:57,842
We'll see what we can do.
Right Tony?

283
00:27:58,052 --> 00:28:03,598
I suggested that the police
don't go knocking down any more doors.

284
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:08,452
<i>I have that Esquire magazine
article on the 10th anniversary</i>

285
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:12,273
<i>about you and the other agents

290
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:34,325
I'm intrigue but why
play it for me?

291
00:28:34,326 --> 00:28:38,333
We like you to consider canceling the
President's dinner tomorrow night.

292
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:42,462
The state dinner, at
the French Embassy?

293
00:28:42,462 --> 00:28:44,267
You have any idea how
long it took to line

294
00:28:44,268 --> 00:28:46,155
up this trip for this
cIose to the election?

295
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:48,184
This guy manipulated the phone system.

296
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:51,520
If he has knowledge of explosives,
there could be a problem.

297
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,877
If you guys do your job and
there wont be any problems.

298
00:28:53,878 --> 00:28:57,486
It's not that hard to smuggle
weapons inside an embassy.

299
00:28:57,487 --> 00:28:59,472
You think the French want
to knock off the President?

300
00:28:59,473 --> 00:29:00,905
Are you nuts? They love him.

301
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:02,949
Why is it every chief of staff--

302
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,358
You have no reason to believe
that this guy is anymore

303
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:07,829
dangerous than thousand of other
people who makes idle treat.

304
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:10,605
But you want me to order
the itinerary of the world

305
00:29:10,606 --> 00:29:13,683
most powerful man and risk
offending 40 million Frenchman?

306
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:16,660
Now isn't possible
that this guy's push the

307
00:29:16,661 --> 00:29:19,799
buttons in you and that make
you overreacting just a little.

308
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,806
I'm trying to protect
your boss damn it.

309
00:29:22,807 --> 00:29:23,761
Well so am l.

310
00:29:24,138 --> 00:29:25,983
We're trailing 12
points in the polls,

311
00:29:25,984 --> 00:29:29,058
if he's doesn't get out there
he's out of the job in six weeks.

312
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:32,546
- He's got to be seen.
- Even if it kills him?

313
00:29:32,547 --> 00:29:33,922
Next order of business?

314
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:40,194
<i>How could being down 12 points down</i>
<i>look like good news?</i>

315
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:43,156
<i>The President was even worse off</i>
<i>weeks ago.</i>

316
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:46,421
<i>He's aids now to keep up with
the voters as much they can,</i>

317
00:29:46,422 --> 00:29:50,077
<i>especially in the Midwest and then the all
important swing from California.</i>

318
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:57,044
Ladies and gentleman, The President
and First Lady of the United States.

319
00:29:57,254 --> 00:30:01,549
and His Excellency, the
President of France and his wife.

320
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,093
Agent Raines, you do
look devastating tonight.

321
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:49,305
- Thank you.
- Good enough to eat, I might add...

322
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:52,808
...if you'll pardon the expression.

323
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:55,869
You know everytime I try
to be sympathise with you,

324
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,897
you say something
really annoys me.

325
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:01,192
Why sympathise?

326
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:05,196
The tape of that phone call.
When he mentioned your wife.

327
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:09,075
- Ex-wife.
- At any rate, I'm sorry.

328
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,383
It strange that
the only sympathy

329
00:31:11,384 --> 00:31:15,581
I get nowaday is a would-be assassin
or a woman I attend to annoy.

330
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:19,919
- Would you care to dance?
- Perhaps some other time.

331
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,421
I get off in a couple of hours.

332
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,536
What are you looking at?

333
00:31:26,537 --> 00:31:30,443
I was just wondering where
do you hide your firearm?

334
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:33,766
Don't tell me, let me guess.

335
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:46,258
<i>We're on our final approach to L.A.
the temperature is above 76 degrees.</i>

336
00:31:46,259 --> 00:31:48,406
<i>It's a beautiful day out there.</i>

337
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:52,743
<i>Thanks for flying with us and we're
looking foward to see you again.</i>

338
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:13,828
I like to deposit this
in the new account.

339
00:32:13,829 --> 00:32:17,643
Okay and I'll need to see
your appropriate resolutions

340
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:26,861
"Microspan Corporation."
What kind of business are you in?

341
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:30,428
- Software.
- Up in San Jose?

342
00:32:30,429 --> 00:32:31,174
Yes

343
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:35,161
I'm based there,
but I'm opening an office here in L.A.

344
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:38,859
- I like San Jose. Are you from there?
- No

345
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,499
Where are you from?

346
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:45,171
- Minneapolis.
- You're kidding! So am l.

347
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:50,092
Well, it's a small world.

348
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:54,035
I hated the winters.
Nine months of the year

349
00:32:54,036 --> 00:32:55,723
winter I stayed indoors
in pig out

350
00:32:55,932 --> 00:33:01,329
I moved here and lost 30 pounds so far.
What high school did you go to?

351
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,278
New Brighton High School.

352
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:11,238
- There isn't any New Brighton High School.
- There was when I was there.

353
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:15,576
Well, maybe I'm just confused.
It happens a lot.

354
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:20,132
What was the name of that high school
one on third just across from--

355
00:33:20,133 --> 00:33:23,351
I'm sorry but I'm very late for
a meeting, will this take long?

356
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:25,920
Not at all, just another minute.

357
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,299
Thank you.

358
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:40,935
- You have a very pleasant way about you.
- Thank you, Mr. Carney.

359
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:57,660
Agent Raines, how would you like
to give a colleague a ride home?

360
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:02,164
- Why do you keep flirting with me?
- Am I flirting with you?

361
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:05,327
You know I can't possibly go
anywhere so why keep doing it.

362
00:34:05,328 --> 00:34:07,837
Maybe because I know I can't
possibly go anywhere.

363
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:11,123
Come on, give me a lift and
I'll go buy you an ice cream.

364
00:34:11,124 --> 00:34:12,341
No further obligations.

365
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,052
Oh, boy.

366
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:21,367
I never worked with a female agent before.
How many are there?

367
00:34:21,368 --> 00:34:22,518
About 125.

368
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:28,315
- Pure window dressing.
- Excuse me?

369
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:34,071
Window dressing.
125 out of a little over 2,000.

370
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:37,075
They have you all around
so that the President

371
00:34:37,076 --> 00:34:39,452
can looks good to his
feminist voters.

372
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:43,790
Do you make an effort to be
obnoxious or is it a gift?

373
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:44,749
It's a gift.

374
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:47,761
Let's face it, half the thing
we do are window dressing.

375
00:34:47,762 --> 00:34:50,171
Take that along side running
with the limousine.

376
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:54,592
It'd take an anti-tank missile
to put a dent in that damn thing.

377
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,220
There we are out for show,

378
00:34:56,221 --> 00:34:59,221
trying to make the President
look more presidential.

379
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:04,977
If I'm here for the feminist vote,
what demographics do you represent?

380
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,438
Let's see.

381
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:10,900
White, piano-playing,
heterosexuals over the age of 50.

382
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:16,238
There ain't a lot of us,
but we do have a powerful lobby.

383
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,365
Well time flies when
you're being annoyed.

384
00:35:22,366 --> 00:35:23,829
Where are you going?

385
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:26,290
- I have a date.
- With whom?

386
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:29,585
That's none of your business.

387
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:34,173
- You want a ride?
- I don't think so.

388
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:38,636
I like it here this time of day.
I think I'll hang out.

389
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:42,264
Okay, well thanks for the ice cream.

390
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:45,851
- See you.
- You're welcome.

391
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:59,573
If she looks back,
that means she's interested.

392
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:04,312
Come on now, give me a lttle
look a little glance back.

393
00:36:04,313 --> 00:36:07,414
Give me a smug look
and be on your way.

394
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:23,037
Well, Abe... . Damn, I wish
I could've been there for you pal

395
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:34,900
Hi, baby, how are you doing?

396
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:38,946
Yes, I missed you too.

397
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:46,497
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.
- Mr Carney?

398
00:36:46,497 --> 00:36:49,069
I got your address
from the phone book.

399
00:36:49,069 --> 00:36:54,962
- But I'm not listed.
- Well, It best I better come clean.

400
00:36:56,089 --> 00:37:00,676
I followed you. I'm sorry,
I'm not very good at this.

401
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:08,317
I'm new in town. I was wondering
if you'd care to join me for dinner tonight.

402
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:11,562
That's sweet, but.. . .

403
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:15,333
and I also wanted to apologise
for lying to you this afternoon,

404
00:37:15,334 --> 00:37:17,727
we both know that I'm
not from Minneapolis.

405
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,696
I shouldn't ask so many questions.

406
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:26,191
Did you mention our conversation
to anyone at the bank this afternoon?

407
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:29,580
- No!
- May I?

408
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:35,628
Rory, settle down!

409
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:40,507
- Pam, what's going on? Oh, hi.
- This is my roommate.

410
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:45,400
- Sally, this is Mr. Carney.
- Jim. Call me Jim. Happy to meet you.

411
00:37:45,401 --> 00:37:46,639
Nice to meet you

412
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:48,922
I was just on my way out.

413
00:37:48,923 --> 00:37:52,353
I'm sorry, but I can't
let you ladies leave.

414
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:54,647
What?

415
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:58,150
You shouldn't have been
from Minneapolis.

416
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,987
Look Mr Carney I don't know
what you want, but. . . .

417
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,710
<i>- Hi, this is Sally
and this is Pam.</i>

418
00:38:23,711 --> 00:38:26,428
<i>Ethier we're out having
fun or we asleep.</i>

419
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:32,351
<i>- Leave your name and number.</i>
<i>- And we'll call you back. Bye.</i>

420
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:43,422
<i>Frank, I hope you don't mind
me calling you at the office.</i>

421
00:38:43,423 --> 00:38:45,322
<i>I was in the neighbourhood</i>

422
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:49,451
- No, why don't you drop by?
<i>- I'd love to Frank.</i>

423
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:54,248
<i>Let me take some time to welcome</i>
<i>those who are joining us late.</i>

424
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:58,419
<i>I'd love to drop by. I like to.</i>
<i>We've got so much in common.</i>

425
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:01,964
We do? Like what?

426
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:05,092
<i>We're both willing to trade</i>
<i>our lives for the President's.</i>

427
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:07,410
<i>We're both honest
and capable and we</i>

428
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:09,805
<i>were both betrayed by
people we trusted.</i>

429
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,892
- I wasn't betrayed, Booth.
<i>- Sure you were, Frank.</i>

430
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:15,958
<i>The Warren Commission report,</i>

431
00:39:15,959 --> 00:39:19,148
<i>they call your procedure
as seriously deficient.</i>

432
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:22,036
<i>They criticised you
and the other agents</i>

433
00:39:22,037 --> 00:39:24,194
<i>who're out drinking
late the night before.</i>

434
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:27,666
<i>As if Kennedy would be
alive today if you'd</i>

435
00:39:27,667 --> 00:39:30,161
<i>been in bed by 10 p.m
it's ludachrist</i>

436
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:34,572
Maybe they were right.

437
00:39:34,573 --> 00:39:37,374
<i>No, as the matter of fact,
they weren't right.</i>

438
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:40,009
<i>You wanted to stationed agents</i>

439
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:42,838
<i>on his bumpers and sideboard .
He refused.</i>

440
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:45,464
<i>and do you know why
I think he refused?</i>

441
00:39:45,465 --> 00:39:48,302
<i>I think he refused because
he had a death wish.</i>

442
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:51,013
<i>He talked all the time</i>
<i>about being assassinated.</i>

443
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:53,849
<i>His favourite poem was</i>
<i>"l Have a Rendezvous with Death"...</i>

444
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:57,478
<i>...which is not a good poem, Frank.</i>

445
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:58,979
<i>I think he wanted to die.</i>

446
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:04,266
<i>And I think he didn't care that
his death would ruin your life.</i>

447
00:40:04,267 --> 00:40:06,862
<i>I think he was a selfish bastard</i>

448
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:09,990
<i>But what do you think, Frank?</i>

449
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:14,036
<i>Frank?</i>

450
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,993
What about you, Booth?
Who betrayed you?

451
00:40:17,994 --> 00:40:20,167
I don't think he's
scrambling it.

452
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:26,090
<i>Some of the same people,</i>
<i>but I'm going to get even.</i>

453
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:32,179
<i>I'll have my day in the sun.</i>
<i>The question is, will you have yours?</i>

454
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:35,974
<i>I think you're in</i>
<i>for a lot more pain.</i>

455
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:39,553
How much of this shit
do I have to listen to?

456
00:40:39,554 --> 00:40:40,395
Jesus

457
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:44,062
He's right across the street.
LaFayette Park. Keep him on.

458
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:46,360
Booth!

459
00:41:19,957 --> 00:41:21,957
Did you see somebody over there?

460
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:26,984
I told you to get in shape, Frank.

461
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:39,872
Is this your current address?

462
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:43,917
And you didn't see anybody suspicious
hanging around that phone booth?

463
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:57,181
That's him! Al, that's him!

464
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:35,886
Secret Service! I'm impounding
this car. He put his hand on here.

465
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:42,267
- We got fingerprints.
- Are you all right, Frank?

466
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:35,654
Hey Tony, have a look at this.

467
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:41,173
- The print from Secret Service?
- Yeah, it's something strange here.

468
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:44,454
Shit! This is C-12.
We can't tell them.

469
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:53,547
Horrigan, I'm afraid
we've drawn a blank.

470
00:43:53,715 --> 00:43:54,795
You're sure?

471
00:43:54,796 --> 00:43:58,844
We ran that print against
everything we got

472
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,164
So what do we do now?

473
00:44:06,165 --> 00:44:08,901
Well I'm meeting with the
President in the morning.

474
00:44:08,902 --> 00:44:10,147
You keep investigating.

475
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:11,392
What should I do?

476
00:44:11,393 --> 00:44:15,110
You're an adult human being aren't you?
Think of something.

477
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,572
You know, you're a real pain in the ass
when things don't go your way Frank.

478
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:21,074
Well your friends warned
you about that.

479
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:39,468
<i>The President hit the
campaign trail today, he</i>

480
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:42,080
<i>left form Andrew Air
Force Base on world tour</i>

481
00:44:42,081 --> 00:44:45,147
<i>that will take him the 12
states over the next 6-days.</i>

482
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:48,174
<i>With just over a month to
go before the election,</i>

483
00:44:48,175 --> 00:44:50,354
<i>The President is trailing his
apponent by 10 points.</i>

484
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:54,190
<i>To close that gap, he'll concentrate
his campaign effort in the Midwest,</i>

485
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:55,859
<i>where he's sagging in the polls.</i>

486
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:59,216
<i>The campaign will wind up in
Chicago with a big rally.</i>

487
00:44:59,217 --> 00:45:02,435
<i>The President's campaign staff
is hopeful by that time...</i>

488
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,035
<i>Reservations. May I help you?</i>

489
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:08,390
Yes I'm calling to find
out when you have

490
00:45:08,391 --> 00:45:11,078
a flight on Tuesday from
Washington to L.A.?

491
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:11,750
Alright

492
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,695
and if possible I'd like
an open-ended ticket

493
00:45:14,696 --> 00:45:17,978
because I may have to make some
stops in the mid-west on my return.

494
00:45:17,979 --> 00:45:18,799
Okay checking

495
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:22,474
<i>To command post, C-5 agent, we'll
off-load the choppers first.</i>

496
00:45:22,475 --> 00:45:23,553
<i>Who's our route agent?</i>

497
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:27,265
<i>C-5 agent, check.
That'll be Jacqueline King.</i>

498
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:32,229
<i>Denver Command post, Watts,
we have arrival at 13:15.</i>

499
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:36,401
<i>King C-5 agent, where will
we keeping the cars secured?</i>

500
00:45:36,402 --> 00:45:39,019
<i>Denver PD has a
defense area for us.</i>

501
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,822
<i>Security room, Watts, we're ten
minutes out. Situation report..</i>

502
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:46,326
Here in Denver we gather today
in the shadow of giants.

503
00:45:46,536 --> 00:45:49,464
Brave pioneers who
overcame counterfying

504
00:45:49,465 --> 00:45:53,250
obstacles to carve a new
nation from the wilderness

505
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:58,755
Today we are asked
to match our vision to their vision.

506
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:02,592
And to pass that legacy on.

507
00:46:02,802 --> 00:46:07,222
- ls sector three secure?
<i>- Sector three is secure.</i>

508
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:11,712
<i>The President campaigning
today today in Denver.</i>

509
00:46:11,713 --> 00:46:13,190
<i>Mean while here in Washington..</i>

510
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:29,286
We are living in a time
of global economic transition.

511
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:34,458
We need compassion and vision
to create a future...

512
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:39,588
<i>...of peace and progress</i>
<i>for each and everyone...</i>

513
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:42,450
<i>That was The President
stumbling in Nebraska today,</i>

514
00:46:42,451 --> 00:46:45,051

later in the month.</i>

515
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:48,889
<i>to compete in the California's
crucial 54 electoral votes.</i>

516
00:47:07,408 --> 00:47:10,660
<i>Hi, Sandy Riggs calling
for James Carney.</i>

517
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:13,137
<i>James, if you're serious
about trying to</i>

518
00:47:13,138 --> 00:47:15,957
<i>catch a rally while you're in
the Midwest, you'd best call me.</i>

519
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:19,669
<i>The President's schedule change hour by hour.</i>

520
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:22,603
<i>and an answer to
your other question,</i>

521
00:47:22,604 --> 00:47:24,815
<i>just send a cheque to
the party headquarters.</i>

522
00:47:24,816 --> 00:47:27,218
<i>Thanks again.
I'm looking foward to meeting you.</i>

523
00:47:27,929 --> 00:47:29,930
Ladies and gentlemen
of Holly, Michigan. . .

524
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:33,433
...the President of the United States.

525
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:40,774
We've gone a long way toward achieving
that goal but there's a lot left to do....

526
00:47:40,942 --> 00:47:44,109
<i>Watts, Flynn we've got some
trouble on track up ahead.</i>

527
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:45,779
<i>You better notify the White House staff.</i>

528
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:49,658
<i>Milwaukee will be easy tomorrow.
We only got one side later.</i>

529
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:57,879
<i>May I have your
attention please,</i>

530
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:01,795
<i>Flight 318 to Milwaukee is
now boarding at Gate 21 .</i>

531
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:04,333
<i>Please have your
boarding passes ready.</i>

532
00:48:04,334 --> 00:48:07,535
<i>All passangers should proceed
to the boarding area now.</i>

533
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,933
Checking.

534
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:19,104
Hey, pal, found any bombs today?

535
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:26,280
- Hello Agent Raines.
- Agent Horrigan

536
00:48:26,281 --> 00:48:29,116
How the First Lady,
she ask about me?

537
00:48:29,117 --> 00:48:31,408
Have you gotten
to know them yet?

538
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:35,053
I normally preferred not to
know the people I'm protecting.

539
00:48:35,054 --> 00:48:35,912
Oh yeah? Why is that?

540
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:39,416
Well you never know, you might decide
they're not worth taking a bullet for.

541
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:42,877
Here comes my replacement.
Care to join me in the bar?

542
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:44,525
We can't drink on the road.

543
00:48:44,526 --> 00:48:47,902
Of course not. But they
have a hell of a piano player.

544
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:59,394
I've played for presidents
and I've with presidents.

545
00:48:59,604 --> 00:49:03,857
Nixon and I once did
a decent duet of "Moonglow."

546
00:49:04,025 --> 00:49:05,857
I heard he didn't like you.

547
00:49:05,858 --> 00:49:08,570
That's not true.
We got on all right.

548
00:49:08,821 --> 00:49:12,342
It was his Chief of Staff, now
that was another matter

549
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:13,911
We were once rally up to a bar,

550
00:49:13,912 --> 00:49:16,703
he ordered me to get rid of
some anti-war protesters.

551
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:18,580
and I said I couldn't do that.

552
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:21,541
I said that Freedom of
speech, that kind of stuff

553
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:26,588
He said, look when I'm talking to you,
I am the President.

554
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:28,163
I said, The President?

555
00:49:28,164 --> 00:49:31,593
You Iook like a sack of shit
in a cheap suit to me, sir!

556
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:34,900
Well I like the "sir"
.It was a classy touch.

557
00:49:34,901 --> 00:49:35,764
I thought so.

558
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:52,739
So Hoorigan how come you never wear
shades when you're standing post?

559
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:56,576
I like the wackos
to see the whites of my eyes.

560
00:49:56,744 --> 00:50:01,181
A good glare can be just as effective as a gun.
Know what I mean?

561
00:50:01,182 --> 00:50:02,290
Oh yeah

562
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:06,002
You know what I mean?

563
00:50:15,805 --> 00:50:17,263
Oh you got me.

564
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:20,767
You'd better stick to the shades,
sweetheart.

565
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:41,705
Agent Raines what are you afraid of?

566
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:46,418
I'm afraid of making a big mistake.

567
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:49,796
Good night.

568
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:50,857
Good, we've got some updates
on Milwaukee.

569
00:51:51,025 --> 00:51:53,359
Thanks.

570
00:52:42,785 --> 00:52:46,955
- Don't answer it.
- No. Oh, shit.

571
00:52:49,959 --> 00:52:53,837
- Raines.
- Watts

572
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:06,432
Okay, I'Il be right down.

573
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:14,983
Well Traveller's losing ground in
Georgia so Milwaukee's out tomorrow.

574
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:20,446
And they're staging a rally
somewhere outside Atlanta.

575
00:53:22,867 --> 00:53:25,451
Damn!

576
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:32,792
What am I doing?

577
00:53:39,008 --> 00:53:41,676
Oh, Lilly... .

578
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:48,016
Damn I've got to put all that shit
back on, god damn it!

579
00:53:55,983 --> 00:54:00,653
You don't know how glad I am to see you all
out here in the rain with me today.

580
00:54:00,863 --> 00:54:06,367
You know I've been going around saying,
"Don't just vote for me, join me."

581
00:54:06,619 --> 00:54:12,165
And today you certainly have.
You know, we may get a tad damp today.

582
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:16,878
But guess who's gonna be all wet
on Election Day?

583
00:54:27,348 --> 00:54:28,598
How about the watch list?

584
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:30,801
I got twenty-three crazies
under surveillance

585
00:54:30,802 --> 00:54:32,836
and Chicago intelligence
handling that morgue

586
00:54:32,837 --> 00:54:33,853
The hospital?

587
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:37,357
Saint Ann an extra units of
Traveller's blood type are on hand.

588
00:54:37,566 --> 00:54:40,706
Accessible to the
alternate route as well.

589
00:54:40,707 --> 00:54:42,459
<i>ETA Chicago 10 minutes</i>

590
00:54:51,372 --> 00:54:54,749
- Under the weather?
- Sick as a dog, Lilly.

591
00:54:55,668 --> 00:54:59,879
What's this? "Psychological
Profile of John Booth."

592
00:55:00,673 --> 00:55:03,591
- So did you make a mistake?
- What?

593
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:08,554
You said in the bar you were afraid
of making a big mistake.

594
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:16,896
Well I mean this job, let's be realistic.
It's not like we work in a bank.

595
00:55:18,899 --> 00:55:22,402
So you had an affair with an
agent that it came out deadly?

596
00:55:22,403 --> 00:55:23,569
He wasn't an agent.

597
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:27,498
But he left you because you
wouldn't quit your job?

598
00:55:27,499 --> 00:55:28,825
You were broken-hearted

599
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:33,287
I left him Frank because
I wouldn't quit my job for him.

600
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:36,416
and I did brake my heart.

601
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:43,214
You vowed never again to let a man
come between you and your career.

602
00:55:43,424 --> 00:55:48,803
Except now you're in love with me and
it scares you a little, doesn't it?

603
00:55:49,096 --> 00:55:52,765
- Blow your nose. Here.
- Sorry.

604
00:55:56,603 --> 00:56:02,859
What would happen
if I gave up my job for you?

605
00:56:06,238 --> 00:56:09,449
Why would you do that?

606
00:56:09,658 --> 00:56:12,354
Well maybe I vowed to
never again let my

607
00:56:12,355 --> 00:56:14,787
career come between
me and a woman.

608
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:23,755
Frank.. . .

609
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:28,259
- Hey, be careful, will you?
- Yeah?

610
00:56:28,469 --> 00:56:32,138
This whole event's been advertised
in advance. Just be alert.

611
00:56:45,986 --> 00:56:48,220
Watts, this is Horrigan,
it's a zoo here.

612
00:56:48,221 --> 00:56:51,657
It's not very secure, we gotta
take Traveller underground.

613
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:57,163
<i>All post, Watts. We are using the
alternate arrival site. Underground.</i>

614
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:14,262
Horrigan to Watts, I think
Booth may be here.

615
00:57:14,263 --> 00:57:16,724
<i>I thought you couldn't
identify him.</i>

616
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:18,543
I can't. Just call it a hunch.

617
00:57:18,544 --> 00:57:22,563
<i>We all do respect to your psychic abilities
but we sticking to the game plan.</i>

618
00:57:22,815 --> 00:57:25,733
<i>All posts take your positions.</i>

619
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:30,863
- You've got a fever, Frank.
- You stay alert in there, will you?

620
00:57:36,537 --> 00:57:40,706
One quality above all
marks this President.

621
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:43,735
and It has earned him
the affection of every

622
00:57:43,736 --> 00:57:46,129
working man and woman
of this country.

623
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:49,966
and that quality is courage.

624
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:58,141
The question is, will we stand
by the man who has stood by us?

625
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:02,395
- Post check, stage right?
- Stage right, all clear.

626
00:58:03,063 --> 00:58:06,732
- Stage left?
- Stage left, clear.

627
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:11,279
- Stage centre?
- Stage centre, clear.

628
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:18,744
The President of the United States
and the First Lady!

629
00:58:57,159 --> 00:59:00,411
- Gun!
- Get down!

630
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:17,303
<i> Security room, follow up,
what the hell's going on in there?</i>

631
00:59:20,182 --> 00:59:22,808
All clear.

632
00:59:23,018 --> 00:59:24,023
<i> False alarm.</i>

633
00:59:24,024 --> 00:59:27,813
<i> Traveller's secure.
All post resume positions.</i>

634
00:59:28,148 --> 00:59:31,817
- Are you hurt, Mr. President?
- I'm Okay. I'm all right.

635
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:37,784
Everything's all right, folks.
Everything's going to be just fine.

636
00:59:37,785 --> 00:59:40,451
We had a little
false alarm there.

637
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:45,915
That was exciting, wasn't it?
Take your seat, please.

638
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:50,115
Security room, Raines.
It was just a balloon popping.

639
00:59:50,116 --> 00:59:52,546
All clear.
Traveller wants to continue.

640
01:00:15,404 --> 01:00:19,031
Do you have any idea how many
votes you cost us last night?

641
01:00:19,283 --> 01:00:21,867
The President came off  looking
like a coward on national television.

642
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:23,761
I thought he came off all right.

643
01:00:23,762 --> 01:00:26,789
You were the one who came off
looking like a damn coward.

644
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:30,835
- Is this just a joke to you?
- No, you're a joke to me Harry.

645
01:00:31,086 --> 01:00:33,087
You have no idea what
we do around here

646
01:00:33,088 --> 01:00:34,279
That's enough Horrigan!

647
01:00:34,279 --> 01:00:35,754
You call me Harry one more time.

648
01:00:35,755 --> 01:00:37,781
You'll be busting
counterfeiters in Alaska!

649
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:40,554
You keep him away from The President,
away from the White House

650
01:00:40,555 --> 01:00:42,179
and you sure as hell
keep him away from me!

651
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:43,538
The man's a disgrace
to the sacred..

652
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:45,433
You can't talk to The White
House Chief of Staff like that.

653
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:46,892
I don't work for him.

654
01:00:47,144 --> 01:00:52,898
No. You work for me. At least
you did. You're off my detail.

655
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:06,620
My Super Bowl debt. ln case
I don't see you after this trip.

656
01:01:15,297 --> 01:01:17,089
You know, Frank.. .

657
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:22,136
...if you just acknowledge that
it was an unfortunate situation--

658
01:01:22,346 --> 01:01:25,030
I'm not going to apologise
for doing my job.

659
01:01:25,031 --> 01:01:26,640
I'm not saying you should.

660
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:30,811
- But the President was humiliated.
- He's alive didn't he?

661
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:33,710
Well yeah we here to safe
guard his dignity as well

662
01:01:33,711 --> 01:01:34,899
I'm not paid for that.

663
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:38,776
What about the time when Kennedy's
girlfriend caught in the

664
01:01:38,777 --> 01:01:41,405
white house and you
said she was with you.

665
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:46,694
Don't you go believe every
rumors someone tells you

666
01:01:46,695 --> 01:01:48,913
Frank Wilder told
me the whole story.

667
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:51,914
About how you were suspended
for a month without pay

668
01:01:51,915 --> 01:01:54,126
I say that was safe
guarding his dignity.

669
01:01:54,628 --> 01:01:58,714
- That was different. He was different.
- Maybe you were different.

670
01:01:58,924 --> 01:02:02,802
I was different.
The whole damn country was different.

671
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:06,071
Everything would be different
right now too if I'd

672
01:02:06,072 --> 01:02:08,557
been half as paranoid
as I am today. Fuck

673
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:17,149
Frank.. . .

674
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:36,043
Why not just retire, Frank? Live off
your pension. What's the point?

675
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:42,341
Somebody else asked me that
not long ago.

676
01:02:42,551 --> 01:02:46,387
You don't spend any money on anything,
except on jazz records.

677
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:50,724
I want to stay
on the Booth case, Sam.

678
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:56,188
All right, but as for
protective detail--

679
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:58,899
I understand.

680
01:03:03,864 --> 01:03:07,616
That thing in Chicago... .

681
01:03:07,826 --> 01:03:12,329
I've never been on the wrong side
of a judgement call like that.

682
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:14,626
You had the flu for Christ sake!

683
01:03:14,627 --> 01:03:17,626
That's been known can
impair your judgement.

684
01:03:17,836 --> 01:03:23,466
Face it, Frank.
You're too old for this shit.

685
01:04:18,939 --> 01:04:20,022
Hello.

686
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:23,776
What happened
in the Windy City, Frank?

687
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:26,779
<i>Booth?</i>

688
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:32,952
- Did the balloon get you a little panicky?
- You were there.

689
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,578
Yes, yes.

690
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:40,029
Watching The President, I
couldn't help wondering

691
01:04:40,030 --> 01:04:43,546
why you'd risk your life
to save a man like that.

692
01:04:43,797 --> 01:04:48,884
You have such a strange job. I can't
decide if it's heroic or absurd.

693
01:04:49,094 --> 01:04:51,566
Now, why would a man
like you risk want

694
01:04:51,567 --> 01:04:54,223
to risk his life to
kill a man like that?

695
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:57,266
<i> Don't you have a psychological
profile on me yet?.</i>

696
01:04:57,267 --> 01:04:59,228
I don't put a lot
of stock in them

697
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:04,316
Nor do I . A man's actions don't equal
the sum of his psychological parts.

698
01:05:04,526 --> 01:05:07,319
<i>- It doesn't work that way.</i>
- Just how does it work?

699
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:13,962
It doesn't work, Frank.

700
01:05:13,963 --> 01:05:18,330
God doesn't punish the wicked
and reward the righteous.

701
01:05:18,498 --> 01:05:22,835
<i>Everyone dies.</i>
<i>Some die because they deserve to.</i>

702
01:05:23,003 --> 01:05:26,100
<i>Others die simpley because
they come from Minneapolis.</i>

703
01:05:26,101 --> 01:05:27,676
<i>lt's random and meaningless.</i>

704
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:33,637
If none of this means anything then
why kill the President?

705
01:05:34,556 --> 01:05:36,650
To punctuate the dreariness.

706
01:05:36,651 --> 01:05:41,362
It's sounds to me like you
need to get yourself laid Booth.

707
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:43,852
You're the same as me Frank.

708
01:05:43,853 --> 01:05:46,942
Name one thing in your
life that has any meaning.

709
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:51,447
- I play the piano.
<i>- That's not enough.</i>

710
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:53,240
How do you know? Do you play?

711
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:58,037
I've seen you in your bar alone.

712
01:05:58,246 --> 01:06:04,793
There's no cause worth fighting for Frank.
All we have is the game.

713
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:09,715
- I'm on offence and you're on defence.
- When do we start playing the game?

714
01:06:10,717 --> 01:06:14,428
The clock's ticking, Frank.
Take care.

715
01:06:14,596 --> 01:06:17,723
<i>Wait. Wait, Booth.</i>

716
01:06:20,894 --> 01:06:24,772
Frank, he scrambled it again.
I missed him.

717
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:27,775
Fuck!

718
01:06:31,571 --> 01:06:33,197
Fucker.

719
01:06:57,055 --> 01:06:59,682
Jesus, Frank.

720
01:07:00,975 --> 01:07:04,878
I've been calling for hours.
I thought something happened to you.

721
01:07:04,879 --> 01:07:05,854
You okay?

722
01:07:06,064 --> 01:07:13,487
No I'm not Okay, I'm sick, I'm tired
and I'm armed, too. So be careful.

723
01:07:13,697 --> 01:07:15,898
You're also maybe a genius.

724
01:07:15,899 --> 01:07:19,159
Not to be recognised
in this lifetime.

725
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:21,275
Tell me, you listen to
the tapes, the call?

726
01:07:21,276 --> 01:07:22,705
Yeah Frank, remember you said--?

727
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:24,957
Call the field office in Minneapolis.

728
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:27,292
See what you can find
about accidental deaths.

729
01:07:27,502 --> 01:07:31,046
Frank!
Will you listen to me, please?

730
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:32,197
Spit it out, god damn it!

731
01:07:32,198 --> 01:07:35,759
You said to have field agents
checking the model builders right?

732
01:07:35,969 --> 01:07:38,942
There is a professor at
The Art Center College

733
01:07:38,943 --> 01:07:41,473
of Design in Pasadena
California Frank.

734
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:43,308
I think we've got something.

735
01:07:43,518 --> 01:07:44,890
Like I told your collegue,

736
01:07:44,891 --> 01:07:48,480
I met him at a design conference
in New Orleans about a year ago.

737
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:52,094
We ordered a few rounds of
drinks at the hotel bar.

738
01:07:52,095 --> 01:07:54,319
He seemed like a
nice enough guy.

739
01:07:54,529 --> 01:07:58,490
But when talked in term of politics
he took on a real nasty edge.

740
01:07:58,658 --> 01:08:01,703
He said he felt betrayed
by the government,

741
01:08:01,704 --> 01:08:05,164
that he wanted to exact
some measure of revenge.

742
01:08:05,373 --> 01:08:08,333
I mean the way he said it
scared the shit out of me.

743
01:08:08,543 --> 01:08:13,505
So I Okay said, Nice talking to you.
And I got the hell out of there.

744
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:18,594
But for the life of me
I cannot remember his name.

745
01:08:18,803 --> 01:08:23,056
But I'm pretty sure
he said he was from Phoenix.

746
01:08:23,266 --> 01:08:26,269
You know who you guys
ought to talk to,

747
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:27,985
a guy in Phoenix named
Walter Wickland.

748
01:08:27,986 --> 01:08:29,271
He know everybody down there

749
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:31,632
Why don't you book us
on a first flight to Phoenix.

750
01:08:31,633 --> 01:08:34,842
Hey how about we get a police artist
together with the professor here

751
01:08:34,903 --> 01:08:37,539
Have a composite
sketch faxed to us.

752
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:40,532
You figured that one
out by yourself, Al?

753
01:08:40,742 --> 01:08:45,621
- Kiss my ass, will you, Frank.
- I told you you'd make a good agent.

754
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:53,128
Well it doesn't look much like him,
but it's got to be Mitch, Mitch Leary.

755
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:59,301
- I haven't seen him in over a year.
- What do you know about the guy?

756
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:03,722
You see this wheelchair?
Mitch bought it for me.

757
01:09:03,932 --> 01:09:07,684
It cost over $1 ,000.

758
01:09:07,894 --> 01:09:11,897
- You see this?
- Take it easy now.

759
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:15,442
This is in case he ever comes back.

760
01:09:15,652 --> 01:09:18,987
He accused me of ripping
off one of his model design.

761
01:09:19,197 --> 01:09:22,658
He said my penalty for
disloyalty was death.

762
01:09:22,951 --> 01:09:26,578
If you put him away,
I'll sleep better.

763
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:29,312
Have you had any idea
where can we find him?

764
01:09:29,313 --> 01:09:32,125
Yeah I think I might've got
his address somewhere.

765
01:10:43,323 --> 01:10:45,866
Don't move.

766
01:10:55,543 --> 01:10:57,628
Drop it!

767
01:11:10,183 --> 01:11:13,185
- Let him go, Horrigan.
- I got him.

768
01:11:13,353 --> 01:11:18,148
It's okay. We're on the same team. Okay?

769
01:11:18,358 --> 01:11:24,237
- Hands, motherfucker!
- I'm getting my identification, okay?

770
01:11:25,156 --> 01:11:28,700
- Give it to me.
- David Coppinger. ClA.

771
01:11:29,869 --> 01:11:34,539
- And who's this asshole?
- He's with me.

772
01:11:36,084 --> 01:11:39,795
- Goddamn it!
- Who're you here for, Leary or me?

773
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:44,591
Mr. Leary used to be
one of our operatives.

774
01:11:45,885 --> 01:11:49,112
Did you know he's threatened
to kill the President.

775
01:11:49,113 --> 01:11:51,098
We didn't think he was serious
until you turn up that finger print

776
01:11:51,265 --> 01:11:54,226
- But you knew. You and the FBI.
- I understand your frustration.

777
01:11:54,394 --> 01:11:58,605
You understand my frustration?
You pompous son of a bitch!

778
01:11:58,898 --> 01:12:01,895
What the fuck did Leary
do for you anyway?

779
01:12:01,896 --> 01:12:03,986
Run coke ? Sell arms to Iran?

780
01:12:04,237 --> 01:12:08,699
It's a C-12 matter,
so this is off the record.

781
01:12:08,908 --> 01:12:10,826
If asked, I'm going to deny it.

782
01:12:13,913 --> 01:12:17,592
Leary's what we nowadays
call a wet boy.

783
01:12:17,593 --> 01:12:19,835
What's a wet boy, Frank?

784
01:12:20,086 --> 01:12:21,944
Leary's an assassin.

785
01:12:21,945 --> 01:12:28,260
In Leary case, that's a bit too gently.
He's more like a predator.

786
01:12:46,446 --> 01:12:49,448
- Was that you shooting?
- Yes.

787
01:12:49,657 --> 01:12:54,745
- What the hell kind of gun is that?
- Something I made.

788
01:12:55,663 --> 01:13:00,250
You made it?
That beats paying for it.

789
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:03,378
- Can I see it?
- Yeah.

790
01:13:04,297 --> 01:13:09,051
- It's light. What's it made of?
- It's composite. Like plastic.

791
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:14,264
Pretty neat! You mind if
I give her a little dance?

792
01:13:14,474 --> 01:13:18,185
- Not at all.
- Go for it.

793
01:13:26,486 --> 01:13:29,696
That is great! That is really great!

794
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:38,160
You won't be interested
in sell it, do you?

795
01:13:38,161 --> 01:13:39,581
No, I need it.

796
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:45,420
- For what?
- To assassinate the President.

797
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:57,849
- Why would you want to do that for?
- Why did you kill that bird, asshole?

798
01:14:05,233 --> 01:14:09,181
Mike Leary was one of our
most effective contractors,

799
01:14:09,182 --> 01:14:10,570
but times changed.

800
01:14:10,822 --> 01:14:13,682
Cutbacks had to be made.
Leary didn't take it too well,

801
01:14:13,683 --> 01:14:15,367
couldn't adjust to civilian life

802
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:17,776
We've not been able to
locate him for sometime now.

803
01:14:17,777 --> 01:14:19,426
Maybe you folks and
FBI had more luck.

804
01:14:19,427 --> 01:14:21,456
If we can work together
if that a possiblity

805
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:23,451
Wouldn't that be refreshing?

806
01:14:23,452 --> 01:14:26,878
We have his fingerprints and
we have numerous photograph.

807
01:14:27,338 --> 01:14:29,512
What makes you think he
look loke any of these.

808
01:14:29,513 --> 01:14:31,596
These things got to be
at least 15 years old.

809
01:14:31,597 --> 01:14:33,589
Man in his line stay
out of the camera eye.

810
01:14:33,761 --> 01:14:37,113
They're worthless, he'll
be in disguise, anyway.

811
01:14:37,114 --> 01:14:39,850
I think we need photo
alterations, Sam.

812
01:14:40,059 --> 01:14:45,480
Gentleman, what I'm about to
show you is highly classified.

813
01:14:47,150 --> 01:14:51,403
This is a former colleague
of Leary's. A close friend.

814
01:14:51,612 --> 01:14:53,918
He went by Leary's
home in Phoenix try

815
01:14:53,919 --> 01:14:56,992
pursuade him to accept
counselling and retrainning

816
01:14:57,243 --> 01:15:01,454
This is how Leary
treats his friends.

817
01:15:05,793 --> 01:15:08,328
We need every possible variable.

818
01:15:08,329 --> 01:15:12,924
Facial hair, skin colorization,
glasses, weight changes.

819
01:15:13,134 --> 01:15:16,803
and keep in mind
he's 15 years older now.

820
01:15:38,910 --> 01:15:43,496
As good as they are, they aren't
much good. The eyes are dead.

821
01:15:43,706 --> 01:15:47,792
You can always tell a man
by his eyes.

822
01:15:48,711 --> 01:15:50,887
Look tomorrow morning
I'd like you to--

823
01:15:50,888 --> 01:15:52,464
I'm resigning tomorrow Frank

824
01:15:52,632 --> 01:15:55,467
What?

825
01:15:55,635 --> 01:15:58,985
What for, just because you
were scared down in Phoenix?

826
01:15:58,986 --> 01:16:01,377
Hell I was scared too.
You did your job

827
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:08,980
I have nightmares Frank about that
boat with the bag over my head.

828
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:13,235
I can't breathe.
Phoenix just clinched it.

829
01:16:13,486 --> 01:16:16,685
The service has
counsellors for this

830
01:16:16,686 --> 01:16:19,366
I've been to counsellors Frank

831
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:23,245
Look I need you Al.
We can get this guy.

832
01:16:23,246 --> 01:16:24,496
I can't do it!

833
01:16:24,664 --> 01:16:31,503
Stop this cockamamie shit. Will you?
Come on, pal, I need you.

834
01:16:31,671 --> 01:16:34,464
Please.

835
01:16:38,261 --> 01:16:42,889
Okay, Frank.

836
01:16:49,897 --> 01:16:54,526
Cockamamie. That's a word
your generation hasn't embraced yet.

837
01:16:54,694 --> 01:16:57,183
Maybe you ought to use
it once in a while

838
01:16:57,184 --> 01:16:59,197
just kinda keep
it alive you know

839
01:16:59,365 --> 01:17:02,534
- Cockamamie!
- Yeah.

840
01:17:02,743 --> 01:17:03,394
Oh, God!

841
01:17:03,395 --> 01:17:05,996
Well, it made you
laugh for Christ sake

842
01:17:06,205 --> 01:17:08,206
You kill me, Frank.

843
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:15,130
Hello.

844
01:17:15,298 --> 01:17:18,952
Hello, Frank.
Let me take a second to give a hearty

845
01:17:18,953 --> 01:17:22,887
welcome to all of you joinning
our program in progress

846
01:17:23,097 --> 01:17:26,099
I know who you are, Leary.

847
01:17:31,314 --> 01:17:36,234
I'm glad Frank. Friends should be able
to call each other by name.

848
01:17:36,444 --> 01:17:39,946
- We're not friends.
<i>- Sure, we are.</i>

849
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:42,157
I've seen what you do to friends.

850
01:17:44,535 --> 01:17:49,331
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You slit your friend's throat.

851
01:17:58,257 --> 01:18:03,136
- You talked to Coppinger, Frank?
- Yeah that's right.

852
01:18:03,346 --> 01:18:07,307
Did you de-louse?
The man's a professional liar.

853
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,100
I saw the photos.

854
01:18:09,268 --> 01:18:12,270
<i>No, you saw what</i>
<i>he wanted you to see Frank.</i>

855
01:18:12,563 --> 01:18:16,107
I saw a picture of your friend
lying on the floor with his throat cut.

856
01:18:16,359 --> 01:18:20,950
What you didn't see Frank, what
you couldn't possibly know is

857
01:18:20,951 --> 01:18:26,356
that they sent my best friend...my
comrade in arms to my home to kill me

858
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:28,287
<i>- Your voice is shaking.</i>

859
01:18:28,288 --> 01:18:30,789
I never lied to you,
Frank and I never will

860
01:18:30,998 --> 01:18:35,585
Why is it everyone who ever knew you
said that you're a sick son-of-bitch.

861
01:18:35,795 --> 01:18:39,532
- Your colleagues. Your wife.
<i>- What does your wife say about you Frank?</i>

862
01:18:39,533 --> 01:18:40,965
We're not talking about me.

863
01:18:41,175 --> 01:18:45,136
Frank, you of all people,
I want you to understand.

864
01:18:45,346 --> 01:18:49,596
Because we both used to think that
this country was a very special place.

865
01:18:49,597 --> 01:18:50,975
You don't know what I--

866
01:18:51,143 --> 01:18:52,703
But you know about me,

867
01:18:52,704 --> 01:18:56,815
do you have any idea what I've
done for God and country?

868
01:18:56,982 --> 01:18:59,651
Some pretty fucking horrible things!

869
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:04,656
I don't even remember who I was
before they sunk their claws into me.

870
01:19:05,032 --> 01:19:06,859
They made you into
a real monster.

871
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:09,397
That's right.
And now they want to destroy me because

872
01:19:09,398 --> 01:19:12,497
we can't have monsters roaming the
quiet country side now can we.

873
01:19:15,668 --> 01:19:19,546
What do you see when you're in
the dark and the demons come?

874
01:19:23,884 --> 01:19:27,628
I see you, Frank.
I see you standing over

875
01:19:27,629 --> 01:19:31,015
the grave of another
dead President.

876
01:19:31,559 --> 01:19:33,620
That's not gonna happen.
I'm on to you

877
01:19:33,621 --> 01:19:34,519
Fuck you, Frank.

878
01:19:34,687 --> 01:19:37,037
I'm willing to trade
my life for his.

879
01:19:37,038 --> 01:19:40,191
I am smart and I am willing,
that's all it takes.

880
01:19:40,359 --> 01:19:44,529
That President is coming home
from California in a fucking box.

881
01:19:45,448 --> 01:19:49,534
- Where in California?
- The address?

882
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:51,992
Come on Frank.
I'll keep you in the game,

883
01:19:51,993 --> 01:19:53,955
but I'm not gonna
throw it for you.

884
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:57,939
- I want you to give yourself up.
<i>- Sorry to live a long and fruitful life?</i>

885
01:19:57,940 --> 01:19:59,461
Well we can work something out

886
01:20:01,714 --> 01:20:06,217
Frank, don't fucking lying to me.
I have a rendezvous with death.

887
01:20:06,427 --> 01:20:07,866
So does the President.

888
01:20:07,867 --> 01:20:10,680
And so do you Frank,
if you get too close to me.

889
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:13,600
You have a rendezvous
with my ass, motherfucker!

890
01:20:13,767 --> 01:20:18,104
Frank, do you know how
easily I could kill you, Frank?

891
01:20:18,314 --> 01:20:19,429
You know how many times

892
01:20:19,430 --> 01:20:21,900
I've watched you go in and
out of that apartment

893
01:20:22,067 --> 01:20:25,361
<i>You are alive because</i>
<i>I have allowed you to live.</i>

894
01:20:25,529 --> 01:20:29,908
so you show me some god damn respect!

895
01:20:40,252 --> 01:20:42,587
St. Francis Hotel,
Florida Avenue on North-east.

896
01:20:58,938 --> 01:21:00,271
Frank.

897
01:23:56,407 --> 01:23:59,659
Take my hand, Frank.

898
01:24:00,369 --> 01:24:04,080
Take it. If you don't, you'll die.

899
01:24:08,001 --> 01:24:10,795
Take it.

900
01:24:25,644 --> 01:24:29,981
You're gonna shoot me Frank
after I saved your life?

901
01:24:33,193 --> 01:24:34,861
Shit.

902
01:24:35,487 --> 01:24:39,657
The only way to save the President
is to shoot me.

903
01:24:39,825 --> 01:24:43,619
Are you willing to do that
to trade your life for his...

904
01:24:43,829 --> 01:24:47,165
...or is life too precious?

905
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:06,142
Leary, don't fucking move!

906
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:11,230
Frank, I got him!

907
01:25:15,319 --> 01:25:18,529
Al?

908
01:25:53,565 --> 01:25:56,692
There's nothing here.

909
01:26:46,577 --> 01:26:50,538
Frank, you've got a phone call.

910
01:27:00,465 --> 01:27:01,632
Yeah?

911
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:06,470
Frank, you looked so sad on the bus.
I'm sorry, it was self-defence.

912
01:27:12,978 --> 01:27:14,457
Tell me about Skellum.

913
01:27:14,458 --> 01:27:18,691
<i>You're barking up the wrong tree
Frank, Skellum is worthless.</i>

914
01:27:18,942 --> 01:27:21,013
Are you gonna meet him in L.A.?

915
01:27:21,014 --> 01:27:24,488
It's late in the game and
you're way behind Frank.

916
01:27:24,781 --> 01:27:28,951
I'm way ahead. Look Leary I know what you
look like. I've seen your eyes.

917
01:27:29,161 --> 01:27:31,068
<i> My eyes might look
different next time.</i>

918
01:27:31,069 --> 01:27:32,371
Not what's behind them wont

919
01:27:32,623 --> 01:27:35,266
You better pray I don't
find you, you prick

920
01:27:35,267 --> 01:27:37,668
Pray? Don't you want
to kill me, Frank?

921
01:27:37,836 --> 01:27:40,796
That's right.

922
01:27:41,006 --> 01:27:43,541
<i>The irony's so thick here so
thich you could choak on it</i>

923
01:27:43,542 --> 01:27:45,009
There is no fucking irony Mitch!

924
01:27:45,177 --> 01:27:49,395
Think Frank, the same government
that trained me to kilI,

925
01:27:49,396 --> 01:27:51,140
trained you to protect.

926
01:27:51,350 --> 01:27:55,144
and  now you want to kill me.
Up on that roof I protected you.

927
01:27:55,354 --> 01:27:57,188
They'll write books about us.

928
01:27:57,356 --> 01:28:03,402
- I'm tired of your bullshit!, Mitch
<i>- Don't be a poor sport.</i>

929
01:28:03,654 --> 01:28:08,802
You could have taken me out, but
you chose to save your ass,

930
01:28:08,803 --> 01:28:10,743
don't cry about it now. Okay?

931
01:28:12,162 --> 01:28:15,206
You know, It does make
me wonder about Dallas though.

932
01:28:15,415 --> 01:28:20,252
<i>Did you really do all you could,</i>
<i>or did you make a choice there too?</i>

933
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:27,927
Do you really have the guts
to take a bullet Frank?

934
01:28:28,178 --> 01:28:32,348
I'll be thinking about that
when I'm pissing on your grave.

935
01:28:36,895 --> 01:28:39,530
There's no one named Skellum
in all of Los Angeles?

936
01:28:39,531 --> 01:28:40,898
I ran 5 different counties

937
01:28:41,066 --> 01:28:45,277
- What about Louisiana?
<i>- Hang on.</i>

938
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:52,034
<i>Frank, no Skellums. Sorry.</i>

939
01:28:52,244 --> 01:28:54,954
Oh shit! Damn it!

940
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:06,206
The election's in three weeks and you're
asking me to commit political suicide.

941
01:29:06,207 --> 01:29:07,800
I'm asking you to stay
out of California.

942
01:29:08,051 --> 01:29:09,088
If this guy's so smart,

943
01:29:09,089 --> 01:29:11,929
he's not gonna tell you where
he'll going to make an attempt.

944
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:14,598
I don't think he'd lie to me.

945
01:29:14,766 --> 01:29:18,227
Ain't that sweet, you've become
that close, have you?

946
01:29:18,437 --> 01:29:22,773
Look people, California is the key
to the whole damn race.

947
01:29:22,983 --> 01:29:26,573
We narrow the gap to 5 points.
We can't let up now.

948
01:29:26,573 --> 01:29:30,224
We have to change our procedure.
Move around in unmarked cars

949
01:29:30,224 --> 01:29:32,390
Frisk people within 50 yards.

950
01:29:32,391 --> 01:29:35,601
Frisk people going in
at $10,000 dinners?

951
01:29:36,997 --> 01:29:38,802
You're overreacting
again Horrigan.

952
01:29:38,803 --> 01:29:41,208
If I don't overreact then
The President's dead.

953
01:29:41,418 --> 01:29:44,076
Why is he even here?
I told you to keep him away from me

954
01:29:44,077 --> 01:29:45,755
Frank's heading
this investigation.

955
01:29:45,964 --> 01:29:47,358
Then let him investigate,

956
01:29:47,359 --> 01:29:50,426
as long as he doesn't within
sight of The President.

957
01:29:51,261 --> 01:29:54,972
If you'lI excuse me, I'm in the
middle of a campaign here.

958
01:30:02,981 --> 01:30:06,650
- Frank. Hi.
- Hi.

959
01:30:07,986 --> 01:30:09,120
Up late?

960
01:30:09,121 --> 01:30:13,657
We'll advance to L.A.
It's will be a lot of work.

961
01:30:13,867 --> 01:30:18,329
- What's up?
- I've got a request.

962
01:30:19,790 --> 01:30:24,460
I'd like you to talk to Watts.
Get me on your advance team.

963
01:30:29,049 --> 01:30:34,011
- He thinks you'll overreact.
- What do you think?

964
01:30:34,179 --> 01:30:37,235
I think maybe you're too
close to all this Frank.

965
01:30:37,236 --> 01:30:39,558
That's why I've got
to be there Lily.

966
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:42,217
I can spot him.
I can anticipate him.

967
01:30:42,218 --> 01:30:44,814
You really think he'll
be in California?

968
01:30:45,023 --> 01:30:47,597
Why would he tip
you off like that?

969
01:30:47,598 --> 01:30:51,028
He wants to keep the game close.
He'll be there

970
01:30:54,116 --> 01:30:59,620
This has nothing to do with
you and me. Strictly professional.

971
01:31:00,288 --> 01:31:04,291
But that son of a bitch
killed my partner. My friend.

972
01:31:04,876 --> 01:31:08,546
I know. I'm sorry.

973
01:31:13,009 --> 01:31:16,053
You're looking at a living legend Lily

974
01:31:16,304 --> 01:31:20,724
The only active agent
who ever lost a President.

975
01:31:23,186 --> 01:31:25,896
Please.

976
01:31:39,786 --> 01:31:42,371
Mr. Horrigan, welcome to Los Angeles.

977
01:31:44,416 --> 01:31:46,773
<i>Can the President
close the remaining</i>

978
01:31:46,774 --> 01:31:49,378
<i>distance in the little
time he has left?</i>

979
01:31:49,588 --> 01:31:52,623
<i>He has in California they say,
The President will appear</i>

980

<i>for a rally at the Bonaventure
Hotel in Los Angelos.</i>

981
01:32:04,853 --> 01:32:10,232
<i>Field office, the advance team</i>

982
01:32:58,406 --> 01:33:01,283

983
01:33:06,373 --> 01:33:10,000
<i>Security room, TST, We've swept the
western end of the motorcade route.</i>

984
01:33:10,168 --> 01:33:12,927
<i>Manholes are secured.
Mailboxes removed.</i>

985
01:33:12,928 --> 01:33:15,006
<i>Abandoned vehicles towed,
bridges checks out.</i>

986
01:33:15,007 --> 01:33:16,090
<i>We're moving to Sector 3</i>

987
01:33:22,097 --> 01:33:26,517
We'll need sharpshooters
on both those towers there.

988
01:33:26,685 --> 01:33:31,939
We need sharpshooters
to cover those restricted areas.

989
01:33:32,148 --> 01:33:36,193
<i>Other polls today had the President</i>
<i>three points behind and still gaining.</i>

990
01:33:36,403 --> 01:33:38,148
<i>But here in the nation capital,</i>

991
01:33:38,149 --> 01:33:40,906
<i>he'll have to close that
margin in California.</i>

992
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:53,502
<i>Welcome to Los Angeles</i>
<i>International Airport.</i>

993
01:35:50,912 --> 01:35:55,109
Raines this is Horrigan,
double-checking those exits?

994
01:35:55,110 --> 01:35:57,751
<i> Yes, Frank this is the
third time now.</i>

995
01:36:07,303 --> 01:36:10,347
Watch list Paul Reubiac yellow,
section five.

996
01:36:16,688 --> 01:36:19,648
Secret Service.

997
01:36:27,198 --> 01:36:34,455
- Robert Stermer.
- He's a bellboy. He's been cleared.

998
01:36:36,541 --> 01:36:42,463
- Robert, have a nice day.
- No questions.

999
01:36:42,672 --> 01:36:47,134
Come on, pack it up. Let's go.
Come on. Pack it up and move

1000
01:36:47,844 --> 01:36:51,555
Mr. Carney, all set.

1001
01:36:51,723 --> 01:36:55,225
Finally we meet!
You are James Carney?

1002
01:36:55,393 --> 01:36:56,711
You must be Sandy Riggs.

1003
01:36:56,712 --> 01:36:59,267
I was starting to wonder
if you really existed,

1004
01:36:59,268 --> 01:37:01,982
maybe you're an angle send
down to help the party.

1005
01:37:02,192 --> 01:37:03,393
I'm very much human.

1006
01:37:03,394 --> 01:37:05,419
Well good then let's
have a drink,

1007
01:37:05,420 --> 01:37:08,197
you know they got the bar on top of
this place, it's beautiful what a view

1008
01:37:09,908 --> 01:37:11,556
When does the President arrive?

1009
01:37:11,557 --> 01:37:14,745
Tomorrow evening just in time
for dinner, which remind me,

1010
01:37:14,913 --> 01:37:17,614
Here's an invitation.
Don't lose it, will you James.

1011
01:37:17,615 --> 01:37:20,876
The Secret Service have been
driving me bunkers over this thing

1012
01:37:21,085 --> 01:37:22,584
I've got a you great seat,

1013
01:37:22,585 --> 01:37:25,756
just a stone throw across
from the President himself

1014
01:37:27,133 --> 01:37:31,220
So tell me James what is Microspan
Corporation all about?

1015
01:37:31,429 --> 01:37:33,706
I just came to meet the
President Mr Riggs

1016
01:37:33,707 --> 01:37:36,141
I wouldn't presume of
bore you with business.

1017
01:37:36,351 --> 01:37:40,270
I don't blame you. One thing I
don't understand is high-tech.

1018
01:37:40,438 --> 01:37:44,775
I can't wait to introduce you.
Look at this beautiful view.

1019
01:37:46,277 --> 01:37:48,028
Yes, very pretty.

1020
01:37:50,448 --> 01:37:54,868
Give me the list of dinner guests.
and who this fat cat organiser?

1021
01:37:55,078 --> 01:37:59,915
Sanford Riggs, The Chairman of
California Victory Fund.

1022
01:38:01,292 --> 01:38:05,462
Call LAPD and make sure
they have no uniforms missing.

1023
01:38:05,797 --> 01:38:07,724
It's been taken care of.

1024
01:38:07,725 --> 01:38:12,302
and call the hospital see if
they lay down supply of B+

1025
01:38:12,804 --> 01:38:18,308
Your average American businessman
who looks at product marketing...

1026
01:38:18,476 --> 01:38:20,701
He sees the length
and width of it.

1027
01:38:20,702 --> 01:38:23,730
The Japanese see the depth,
the long term effect

1028
01:38:23,940 --> 01:38:26,373
We look at the next
fiscal quater.

1029
01:38:26,374 --> 01:38:29,570
The Japanese look at
quarter of the century.

1030
01:38:29,779 --> 01:38:33,211
Try to get our people
understand that.

1031
01:38:33,212 --> 01:38:35,922
Mr. Riggs, can I talk
to you for a moment?

1032
01:38:35,923 --> 01:38:36,994
Excume me fellas

1033
01:38:37,829 --> 01:38:41,832
- Who's that?
- Secret Service agent.

1034
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:45,369
Do you know everyone who's
attending this dinner personally?

1035
01:38:45,370 --> 01:38:46,086
I sure do.

1036
01:38:46,296 --> 01:38:49,055
How about these pictures here,
any of them look familiar

1037
01:38:49,056 --> 01:38:51,717
Look I went through this with
another agent yesterday.

1038
01:38:51,926 --> 01:38:55,637
I'll cooperate, but this is
bordering on harassment.

1039
01:38:55,847 --> 01:38:59,266
I'm a harassing kind of guy.

1040
01:39:00,018 --> 01:39:01,935
No, no, no, no.

1041
01:39:03,354 --> 01:39:05,689
I'll be right back, Mr. Carney.

1042
01:39:06,107 --> 01:39:07,858
Bill he did what anyone of us would.

1043
01:39:08,026 --> 01:39:10,496
<i>- He beat up a bellboy on television.</i>
- No I was there

1044
01:39:10,497 --> 01:39:11,778
<i>I'd say he was a little overwrought.</i>

1045
01:39:12,030 --> 01:39:15,032
Well we're all a little overwrought knowing
Leary's out there someplace.

1046
01:39:15,283 --> 01:39:18,368
<i>- You don't think he's a liability?</i>
- No I don't think he's a liability.

1047
01:39:18,661 --> 01:39:21,496
<i>Well, you're in the minority.</i>
<i>I want him gone before Traveller's arrival.</i>

1048
01:39:21,706 --> 01:39:24,389
<i>Send him on to San Diego
first thing in the morning.</i>

1049
01:39:24,390 --> 01:39:25,959
By whose order, Harry Sargent?

1050
01:39:26,127 --> 01:39:30,547
<i>Traveller.</i>
<i>Do you want to tell him or should l?</i>

1051
01:39:30,757 --> 01:39:35,218
Miss Raines, somebody's
approaching Traveller's suite.

1052
01:40:11,673 --> 01:40:14,508
-Hi.
-Hi.

1053
01:40:15,927 --> 01:40:19,267
What are you doing
up here Frank?

1054
01:40:19,268 --> 01:40:23,392
I was just seeing
anything more I can do.

1055
01:40:25,103 --> 01:40:30,899
You know, between LAPD,
the FBI and the rest of us...

1056
01:40:31,109 --> 01:40:36,530
...there are 229 people
protecting Traveller tomorrow.

1057
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:40,534
A lot of guns.

1058
01:40:41,244 --> 01:40:46,790
If Leary gets off a shot, You and I
could be killed in the crossfire.

1059
01:40:48,459 --> 01:40:51,420
Frank.

1060
01:40:53,131 --> 01:40:57,926
- Bill Watts just called.
- Heard about the bellman?

1061
01:40:58,136 --> 01:41:01,304
So did Traveller.

1062
01:41:01,472 --> 01:41:07,227
They want you to go to San Diego
and assist in the advance tomorrow.

1063
01:41:07,437 --> 01:41:10,814
Just like that.

1064
01:41:11,107 --> 01:41:15,861
Frank, it's not just you against Leary.

1065
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:20,490
Have some faith in the rest of us.

1066
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:25,495
You know something?

1067
01:41:27,749 --> 01:41:31,752
For years I've been listening
to all these idiots on bars...

1068
01:41:31,961 --> 01:41:36,882
...with all their pet theories on Dallas.

1069
01:41:37,091 --> 01:41:40,844
It was the Cubans, or the CIA.

1070
01:41:41,053 --> 01:41:44,222
The white supremacists, or the mob.

1071
01:41:44,432 --> 01:41:49,811
Whether it was one weapon
or whether it was five.

1072
01:41:51,063 --> 01:41:54,691
None of that meant too much to me.

1073
01:41:55,359 --> 01:41:59,404
But Leary....

1074
01:41:59,614 --> 01:42:04,576
He questioned whether I had the guts
to take that fatal bullet.

1075
01:42:07,038 --> 01:42:10,832
God, that was a beautiful day.

1076
01:42:13,211 --> 01:42:16,671
The sun was out.

1077
01:42:17,381 --> 01:42:20,717
It had been raining all morning.

1078
01:42:24,555 --> 01:42:29,351
The first shot
sounded like a firecracker.

1079
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:33,730
I looked over and I saw him.
I could tell he was hit.

1080
01:42:36,943 --> 01:42:40,237
I don't know why I didn't react.

1081
01:42:40,446 --> 01:42:45,116
I should've reacted.
I should've been running flat out.

1082
01:42:46,536 --> 01:42:50,038
I just couldn't believe it.

1083
01:42:53,543 --> 01:42:58,380
If only I'd reacted,
I could've taken that shot.

1084
01:43:03,719 --> 01:43:07,514
It would've been alright with me.

1085
01:43:56,147 --> 01:44:00,233
- What's the number in San Diego office?
- 619 ukulele.

1086
01:44:00,651 --> 01:44:01,393
Ukulele?

1087
01:44:01,394 --> 01:44:04,362
That's how I remember it you
know, 7 numbers 7 letters.

1088
01:44:04,572 --> 01:44:08,867
You just push U-K-E-L-E-L-E, easy

1089
01:44:10,328 --> 01:44:14,409
What a minute, isn't
Ukulele spelled U-K-U?

1090
01:44:14,410 --> 01:44:15,707
I don't know.

1091
01:44:15,917 --> 01:44:21,171
But the phone number is U-K-E-L-E-L-E.

1092
01:44:29,597 --> 01:44:35,769
U-K-E-L. Wait a second.

1093
01:44:55,206 --> 01:44:56,247
Jesus.

1094
01:44:56,499 --> 01:45:01,086
We have an arrival. Chopper standing
by to take Travell's to site one.

1095
01:45:15,393 --> 01:45:19,187
<i>- Southwest Savings, may I help you?</i>
- Southwest?

1096
01:45:19,397 --> 01:45:25,026
<i>- Yes. May I help you? Hello?</i>
- What's your address?

1097
01:45:30,491 --> 01:45:32,701
Taxi!

1098
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:40,065
Raines to Lobby agent, post check.
Post 3?

1099
01:45:40,066 --> 01:45:41,084
<i>Roger, in place.</i>

1100
01:45:41,293 --> 01:45:43,837
- Post 6?
<i>- Roger in place.</i>

1101
01:45:44,046 --> 01:45:46,798
<i>- Post 12?</i>
- Roger, in place.

1102
01:45:52,972 --> 01:45:55,890
Wait right here.

1103
01:45:57,852 --> 01:45:58,827
I'm sorry there's no

1104
01:45:58,828 --> 01:46:01,312
Mitchel Leary or Joseph
McCrawley in our accounts.

1105
01:46:01,522 --> 01:46:06,776
Try to imagine him in disguise.
A hat, wigs, mustache, that sort of thing.

1106
01:46:07,611 --> 01:46:10,797
I haven't seen him but I've only
been here a couple of weeks

1107
01:46:10,798 --> 01:46:13,199
Who was in charge of new
accounts before you?

1108
01:46:13,409 --> 01:46:18,121
- Pam Magnus.
- Where can I find her?

1109
01:46:20,124 --> 01:46:24,502
She's dead. She was murdered.

1110
01:46:56,994 --> 01:47:00,537
Lily, she was murdered and
she was from Minneapolis

1111
01:47:00,538 --> 01:47:01,831
They won't cancel.
You know what Sargent said.

1112
01:47:02,041 --> 01:47:05,250
At least make the arrival underground.
Don't give Leary a target

1113
01:47:05,251 --> 01:47:06,336
They want a big show.

1114
01:47:06,545 --> 01:47:08,546
They said unless we have
proof that leary's here

1115
01:47:08,547 --> 01:47:10,465
The proof may just have
been a dead president?

1116
01:47:17,014 --> 01:47:20,576
I'm pulling up all the accounts
open by Pam the last 6 months.

1117
01:47:20,577 --> 01:47:22,951
The problem is we don't log it
by the date they're entered.

1118
01:47:22,952 --> 01:47:24,166
It's going to take time to compile

1119
01:47:24,230 --> 01:47:27,023
Fax me the list as soon as
you get them. Will you please

1120
01:47:30,653 --> 01:47:33,780
All agents in position.

1121
01:48:38,637 --> 01:48:43,725
- Please step back sir.
- Would you please empty your pockets.

1122
01:48:45,561 --> 01:48:48,646
Thank you.

1123
01:49:41,367 --> 01:49:42,909
You're from Texas though, right?

1124
01:49:51,001 --> 01:49:55,505
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>the President of the United States.</i>

1125
01:50:08,602 --> 01:50:09,852
I'm sorry?

1126
01:51:24,470 --> 01:51:27,972
Frank! What're you doing here? Watts
is gonna shit if he sees you!

1127
01:51:28,182 --> 01:51:30,072
Have you got a fax for me?

1128
01:51:30,073 --> 01:51:33,561
Yeah, just now, what is it?
What's this about?

1129
01:51:37,358 --> 01:51:41,277
What the hell is going on, Frank?

1130
01:51:54,875 --> 01:51:57,460
James Carney.

1131
01:52:14,144 --> 01:52:16,604
Carney, Mr. James.

1132
01:52:18,315 --> 01:52:21,609
- Jesus.
- Frank!

1133
01:52:39,420 --> 01:52:43,673
- What the hell is he doing here?
- I don't know.

1134
01:52:44,508 --> 01:52:47,969
- Who the hell gave you permission--
- He's here. His name is Jim Carney.

1135
01:52:48,137 --> 01:52:53,683
- I want the damn seating chart.
- Give him the chart.

1136
01:53:22,337 --> 01:53:25,423
Gun!

1137
01:53:38,312 --> 01:53:41,481
Stop! Put the gun down!

1138
01:54:04,588 --> 01:54:05,671
Get down!

1139
01:54:12,304 --> 01:54:13,930
Don't shoot!

1140
01:54:14,598 --> 01:54:17,808
Get him in the car!

1141
01:54:23,857 --> 01:54:25,233
Raines to shooter. Hold your fire!

1142
01:54:33,116 --> 01:54:34,367
Get out of his way!

1143
01:54:35,786 --> 01:54:37,703
He's got a hostage!

1144
01:54:45,003 --> 01:54:49,715
Raines to shooters.
If you have a shot, take it.

1145
01:55:03,063 --> 01:55:04,438
Nice view.

1146
01:55:06,066 --> 01:55:12,196
- What's the plan, captain?
- It's your man up there. You tell me.

1147
01:55:12,406 --> 01:55:14,376
All post hold radio traffic,

1148
01:55:14,377 --> 01:55:18,035
get me sharpshooters on the
north and west towers.

1149
01:55:18,245 --> 01:55:21,747
Take the subject out.

1150
01:55:38,473 --> 01:55:40,600
You had the guts.
You took the bullet.

1151
01:55:41,810 --> 01:55:47,189
- I broke my damn ribs.
- Sorry, I wasn't aiming at you.

1152
01:55:47,566 --> 01:55:52,403
Where the hell are the shooters?

1153
01:55:52,613 --> 01:55:54,576
West tower in place. No lights.

1154
01:55:54,577 --> 01:55:57,742
No light in sight, shit! No shot
from the north. We can't see inside

1155
01:55:57,951 --> 01:56:01,704
Wearing a bullet-proof vest Frank?
That's a bit of a cheat don't you think?

1156
01:56:01,872 --> 01:56:06,417
- Otherwise, you played a good game.
- It's no game, Leary.

1157
01:56:06,627 --> 01:56:11,213
I was doing my job.
What going to do now?

1158
01:56:11,381 --> 01:56:14,258
Do you believe
in the nobility of suicide?

1159
01:56:15,302 --> 01:56:16,302
No.

1160
01:56:16,470 --> 01:56:20,097
But if you want to blow your head off,
go ahead, be my guest.

1161
01:56:20,307 --> 01:56:22,771
Nicely put Frank,
except you see.

1162
01:56:22,772 --> 01:56:26,395
I don't want to leave this
miserable world alone.

1163
01:56:27,230 --> 01:56:32,234
- West tower, do you have a shot?
- Negative, too dark. Target unclear.

1164
01:56:33,654 --> 01:56:37,224
It's better to die with a
friend don't you think Frank?

1165
01:56:37,225 --> 01:56:40,284
Friend? You're a damn killer!
You sick bastard!

1166
01:56:40,494 --> 01:56:44,372
Don't talk to me like that,
I saved your life. You owe me.

1167
01:56:44,581 --> 01:56:49,627
- I don't owe you shit.
- I was always honest and fair with you.

1168
01:56:49,836 --> 01:56:54,924
- Go ahead and shoot.
- It's Frank. Quiet!

1169
01:56:55,133 --> 01:56:58,260
<i>- Come on damn it.</i>
- Frank, are you talking to me?

1170
01:56:58,470 --> 01:57:01,972
- Well what are you waiting for?
- What am I waiting for?

1171
01:57:02,182 --> 01:57:06,018
I'm waiting for you to show me
some god damn gratitude.

1172
01:57:06,269 --> 01:57:10,815
Without me, you're just be another
sad-eyed, piano-playing drunk.

1173
01:57:11,024 --> 01:57:14,902
<i>I brought you into this game.</i>
<i>I let you keep up with me.</i>

1174
01:57:15,362 --> 01:57:18,823
- I made you a god damn hero today.
- You didn't make me anything.

1175
01:57:19,032 --> 01:57:21,951
I redeemed your pathetic shitty life.

1176
01:57:22,202 --> 01:57:25,162
I just did my job. You're the one
with fucking the pathetic life.

1177
01:57:25,372 --> 01:57:27,149
<i> Go ahead and shoot! Damn it!</i>

1178
01:57:27,150 --> 01:57:30,334
They can't see inside.
lf they fire you'Il be hit.

1179
01:57:30,627 --> 01:57:34,463
- I want you to thank me first, Frank.
- Shut up and shoot.

1180
01:57:34,631 --> 01:57:36,298
All right, Frank.

1181
01:57:38,719 --> 01:57:39,943
All right, Frank.

1182
01:57:39,944 --> 01:57:43,472
Shooters stand by to fire.
Wait for my command.

1183
01:57:45,350 --> 01:57:49,353
- Sleep well, my friend.
- Just one thing, aim high.

1184
01:57:49,563 --> 01:57:52,064
- What?
- Aim high!

1185
01:57:52,315 --> 01:57:54,400
- Now!
- You bastard!

1186
01:58:46,369 --> 01:58:50,289
Take my hand.
If you don't, you'Il die.

1187
01:58:50,499 --> 01:58:53,140
You want to save me, Frank?

1188
01:58:53,141 --> 01:58:58,422
To be honest and fair with you, no.
But it's my job.

1189
01:59:04,304 --> 01:59:06,889
Take it.

1190
02:00:01,570 --> 02:00:05,322
- Are you okay?
- Stand back please.

1191
02:00:08,869 --> 02:00:11,996
We've been working with Agent
Horrigan for quite some time.

1192
02:00:12,163 --> 02:00:16,959
Yes, Frank exemplifies
courage and self-sacrifice. Frank!

1193
02:00:17,711 --> 02:00:21,839
I guess I overreacted again, Harry.

1194
02:00:41,109 --> 02:00:46,864
Agent Horrigan, why are you
retiring from the Secret Service?

1195
02:00:47,032 --> 02:00:48,639
Well because I hate desk work

1196
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:51,410
and I'm too old for running
along side limousine

1197
02:00:51,578 --> 02:00:54,602
And thanks to you people
pestering my pictures

1198
02:00:54,603 --> 02:00:57,625
up everwhere I'm no good
for undercover work.

1199
02:00:58,585 --> 02:01:00,676
- How are you, Frank?
- Sam

1200
02:01:00,677 --> 02:01:04,131
Frank, The President sent
his limo for you.

1201
02:01:04,341 --> 02:01:08,344
- Well that's the least he could do.
- Good. I love public transportation.

1202
02:01:12,057 --> 02:01:15,100
Come on in.

1203
02:01:16,436 --> 02:01:19,855
Make yourself at home.

1204
02:01:31,368 --> 02:01:35,996
- So, what do you think?
- I like it.

1205
02:01:36,164 --> 02:01:42,753
<i>Hello, Frank. By the time</i>
<i>you hear this, it'll be over.</i>

1206
02:01:42,963 --> 02:01:48,217
<i>The President is most likely dead</i>
<i>and so am l.</i>

1207
02:01:48,426 --> 02:01:55,891
<i> I wonder Frank, did you kill me? Who won</i>
<i>our game? Not going to matters.</i>

1208
02:01:56,101 --> 02:01:58,877
<i>For among friends, like you and me,
it's not wether you win or lose</i>

1209
02:01:58,878 --> 02:01:59,979
<i>it's how you play the game.</i>

1210
02:02:00,146 --> 02:02:02,898
<i>and now the game's done.</i>

1211
02:02:03,108 --> 02:02:06,068
<i>It's time to get on with your life.</i>

1212
02:02:06,236 --> 02:02:11,240
<i> But I worry that you have
no life to get on with Frank</i>

1213
02:02:11,408 --> 02:02:14,493
<i>You're a good man.</i>

1214
02:02:14,703 --> 02:02:18,831
<i>and good men, like you and me,</i>
<i>are destined to travel a lonely road.</i>

1215
02:02:19,874 --> 02:02:23,085
<i>Goodbye and good luck.</i>

1216
02:02:27,090 --> 02:02:32,261
I bet you that brown pigeon down
there flies off before the white one.

1217
02:02:32,429 --> 02:02:35,180
How do you know?

1218
02:02:35,432 --> 02:02:40,602
I know things about pigeons, Lilly.

1219
02:02:50,946 --> 02:02:58,946
