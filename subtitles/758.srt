506
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:20,158
Hey, I said, pull over to the side
and let me out.

507
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:24,180
Hey, that stuff goes on beautiful, Tony.
Best vinyl I ever seen at that price.

508
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:25,849
See? I told you.
You just listen to me, right?

509
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:29,602
You know, you saved me a bit
of change on the job. You know paint.

510
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:31,855
You ever want a job as a painter,
why don't you let me know, huh?

511
00:29:31,938 --> 00:29:33,690
You make twice as much
as you make here,

512
00:29:33,773 --> 00:29:35,984
but you break your back.
You interested?

513
00:29:36,067 --> 00:29:37,986
- I don't know.
- Don't be interested.

514
00:29:38,069 --> 00:29:41,573
You'll make twice as much,
but you'll break your back.

- I gave you a raise.</i>

516
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:47,245
- You gave me what?
- A raise.

517
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:51,124
- You kidding me?
- No. Come on, look. See how much it is.

518
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:53,585
You gave me a raise? Thank you.
I can't believe this.

519
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:55,044
Wait, hold on, you better look first.

520
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:56,754
I don't gotta look.
It don't make no difference.

521
00:29:56,838 --> 00:29:58,423
You gave me a raise.
That's the important thing.

522
00:29:58,506 --> 00:30:00,842
- It's only $2.50.
- So what?

523
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:03,303
That's $2.50. It ain't much.

524
00:30:03,386 --> 00:30:05,930
The important thing is it's a raise.
I think that's really great.

525
00:30:06,014 --> 00:30:07,932
I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna give you $3.50, all right?

526
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:09,392
- You do not have to, Mr. Fusco.
- I'll give you $3.50.

527
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:11,436
- I like the raise just the way it is.
- I'll give you $1 more.

528
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:13,313
Shut up, will you? $4.

529
00:30:13,396 --> 00:30:15,607
I'll make it an even $4.

530
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:16,983
Christ, I've never seen anybody

531
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:19,611
so shit-ass happy over
a crummy $2.50 raise.

532
00:30:19,694 --> 00:30:23,156
Wait a minute. $2?
You just said $4.00, didn't you?

533
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:29,704
What the hell are you doing?

534
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:32,165
- I just feel like it, all right?
- Girls do that.

535
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:34,292
I got a raise today.
How do you like that?

536
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:36,461
Yeah?
Why didn't you say so during dinner?

537
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:40,048
We could've used the conversation.
Put them down. Come here.

538
00:30:40,131 --> 00:30:42,926
- How much you get?
- It's gonna be $4.00.

539
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:45,386
It was... It was $2.50, right?

540
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,180
But he raised the raise

541
00:30:47,263 --> 00:30:49,766
when he found out
I wasn't so, you know, disappointed.

542
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:51,351
- $4.00?
- Yeah.

543
00:30:51,434 --> 00:30:54,562
Shit. You know what $4.00 buys today?

544
00:30:54,646 --> 00:30:56,940
It don't even buy $3.00.

545
00:30:57,023 --> 00:30:59,817
I don't see nobody giving you a raise
down at Unemployment.

546
00:30:59,901 --> 00:31:02,362
$4.00. Shit.

547
00:31:02,445 --> 00:31:05,156
I knew you'd piss on it.
Go on, just piss on it, right?

548
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,825
A raise says, like, you're good,
you know what I mean?

549
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:10,161
You know how many times somebody
told me I was good in my life?

550
00:31:10,245 --> 00:31:12,413
Two. Two. Twice. Two fucking times,

Why ain't you waiting inside?

555
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:47,198
Well, I wanted to watch you
come down the street.

556
00:31:47,282 --> 00:31:48,908
I like the way you walk.

557

Shit.

558
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:54,747
Tony, listen, I've been thinking.

559
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:57,500
Maybe I'll make it with you.

Annette. You know that?

I mean, you say we're gonna make it,
that means we're gonna make it, right?

563
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:09,053
I mean, like,
I got no say in this at all, right?

564
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:10,555
It's time we went out.

565
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:12,140
You told me you wanted to do it.

566
00:32:12,223 --> 00:32:14,058
You told me
how horny a man gets when he's 19,

567
00:32:14,142 --> 00:32:15,935
how much his balls ache
morning, noon and night,

568
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:18,980
six days a week, sometimes seven,
if he don't get it.

569
00:32:19,063 --> 00:32:21,482
How do you remember those things?

570
00:32:21,566 --> 00:32:23,901
Look, Annette, we're gonna be
spending a lot of time together,

571

you know, rehearsing,
practicing, whatnot.

it would be like we was going together.

And I won't be going with you.

00:32:31,868 --> 00:32:34,454

You a nice girl or you a cunt?

I don't know. Both?

576
00:32:36,748 --> 00:32:39,542
You can't be both. I mean, that's a thing
a girl's gotta decide early on.

577
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:42,628
You gotta decide whether
you're gonna be a nice girl or a cunt.

- Hey, Tony, my man.

00:37:53,147 --> 00:37:56,275
You gonna sleep here tonight?
You wanna sleep in my room?

669
00:37:56,359 --> 00:37:59,278
- Yeah, I thought I would.
- All right, you can...

670
00:37:59,362 --> 00:38:01,739
I'll get your blankets for you.

671
00:38:21,592 --> 00:38:24,095
Frank, how come you left? Really?

672
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:31,352
It's not easy to explain, Anthony.
A lot of things.

673
00:38:32,395 --> 00:38:34,814
One day, you look at a crucifix,

674
00:38:36,273 --> 00:38:39,402
and all you see
is a man dying on a cross.

675
00:38:40,736 --> 00:38:43,698
But that's only a backdrop
to something else.

676
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:48,911
Mama and Papa,
their dreams of pious glory.

677
00:38:49,453 --> 00:38:52,456
They turn you
into what they wish at a time...

678
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:57,753
You can't defend yourself
against their fantasies.

679
00:38:57,837 --> 00:39:02,049
All I ever really had any belief in
was their image of me as a priest.

680
00:39:02,133 --> 00:39:03,551
That's all.

681
00:39:11,434 --> 00:39:15,604
Guess we're gonna have to take
your picture down from the mantle.

682
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,986
Know what's weird?

683
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:25,239
Like, I always felt like
I was the shit of the family,

684
00:39:25,322 --> 00:39:26,699
and you was always, like, perfect.

685
00:39:26,782 --> 00:39:31,162
Now that I'm the disgrace to the family,
I'm not so perfect anymore.

686
00:39:31,954 --> 00:39:34,540
So, maybe you're not shit anymore.

687
00:39:37,001 --> 00:39:40,796
Yeah, maybe if you ain't so good,
I ain't so bad, you know?

688
00:39:41,464 --> 00:39:42,673
Yeah.

689
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,926
Ha.

690
00:39:52,433 --> 00:39:53,976
- Give me the groceries, motherfucker.
- Hey, come on.

691
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:55,436
- Hey, don't take my groceries, man.
- I'm hungry.

692
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:56,937
- I'm hungry, Gus.
- Hey, what are you doing?

693
00:39:57,021 --> 00:39:59,440
Hey, come on! Hey, come on!
Hey, don't eat the apple!

694
00:39:59,523 --> 00:40:01,442
- Give me... Give me it back.
- Here.

695
00:40:01,525 --> 00:40:03,694
Jesus.
What's the matter with you anyway?

696
00:40:03,778 --> 00:40:06,071
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

697
00:40:06,155 --> 00:40:08,032
My brother, he quit the Church.
You believe that?

698
00:40:08,115 --> 00:40:09,492
- Yeah?
- I feel...

699
00:40:09,575 --> 00:40:11,660
I feel wild. I got all this energy.
I can't believe it.

700
00:40:11,744 --> 00:40:12,828
Yeah?

701
00:40:12,912 --> 00:40:14,330
Hey, listen, I'll call you later tonight,
all right?

702
00:40:14,413 --> 00:40:15,748
Yeah, we'll do... Hey!

703
00:40:15,831 --> 00:40:18,375
- See you later, Gus.
- I'll see you.

Pete, she come in?

710
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:32,431
I told you on the phone,
she comes in on Tuesday.

711
00:40:32,515 --> 00:40:35,351
- I know. So, did she come in or what?
- And what is it today, huh?

712
00:40:35,434 --> 00:40:37,228
- It's Tuesday.
- Yeah.

Hello, Stephanie Mangano.

718
00:41:25,276 --> 00:41:27,611
I'm Tony Manero.

719
00:41:27,695 --> 00:41:30,656
We both got the same last initials.
How do you like that?

720
00:41:30,739 --> 00:41:32,867
Wow. We get married,
I don't have to change the monogram

721
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:34,827
on my luggage, huh?

722
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:38,539
Somebody told me
you was practicing to be a bitch.

723
00:41:38,622 --> 00:41:39,874
Is that true?

724
00:41:47,256 --> 00:41:49,425
All right, Mr. Manero.
What do you want to ask me?

725
00:41:49,508 --> 00:41:51,552
I would like to take you out to coffee.
Would that be good?

726
00:41:51,635 --> 00:41:53,637
That's it, huh?
You want me to have coffee with you?

727
00:41:53,721 --> 00:41:55,598
I think you're a very good dancer.

728
00:41:55,681 --> 00:41:59,351
You know that 2001 Odyssey,

729
00:41:59,435 --> 00:42:01,979
they got a dance contest now.

730
00:42:02,062 --> 00:42:05,566
And I think that we could be
a dynamite team together.

731
00:42:09,111 --> 00:42:11,447
- How old are you, huh?
- I'm 20.

732
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:17,661
Well, I'm 19 at the moment,
but I'll be 20 very shortly.

733
00:42:17,745 --> 00:42:19,204
What I think is this.

734
00:42:19,288 --> 00:42:21,248
There's a world of difference
between us, you know?

735
00:42:21,332 --> 00:42:24,084
Not just chronologically,
but emotionally,

736
00:42:24,168 --> 00:42:26,545
culturally, physically, every which way.

737
00:42:26,629 --> 00:42:28,339
And this world would get much bigger

738
00:42:28,422 --> 00:42:31,175
and much worse
with every passing week.

739
00:42:31,926 --> 00:42:33,594
What kind of shit is that?

740
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:36,263
- Coffee, not sex.
- Just coffee, huh?

741
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:39,183
See, look, where I work,
the people are very remarkable.

742
00:42:39,266 --> 00:42:41,769
They're not like these here
Bay Ridge people at all.

743
00:42:41,852 --> 00:42:43,854
You mean snobs
instead of slobs, right?

- What?
- Nothing.

00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:48,025
Hey, you know, Bay Ridge
ain't the worst part of Brooklyn.

You know what I'm talking?

747
00:42:49,276 --> 00:42:50,945
I mean, you know,
it ain't like a hellhole or nothing.

748
00:42:51,028 --> 00:42:53,781
Yeah, well, it ain't Manhattan.
It isn't Manhattan.

749
00:42:53,906 --> 00:42:55,699
You got no idea how it changes,
you know.

750
00:42:55,783 --> 00:42:57,201
Just right over there,
right across the river,

751
00:42:57,284 --> 00:42:59,453
everything is different,
completely different.

752
00:42:59,578 --> 00:43:01,038
It's beautiful, just beautiful.

753
00:43:01,121 --> 00:43:03,958
The people are beautiful,
offices are beautiful.

754
00:43:04,083 --> 00:43:06,794
The secretaries, you know,
they all shop at Bonwit Teller.

755
00:43:06,877 --> 00:43:07,962
Oh, yeah?

756
00:43:08,087 --> 00:43:09,880
And, like, the lunch hours
are beautiful, too.

757
00:43:09,964 --> 00:43:13,300
Like, you know, they'll give you,
like, two hours for lunch

758
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:15,135
- to do something that's related.
- Oh, yeah?

759
00:43:15,219 --> 00:43:18,055
Like we've seen
Zeffirelli's <i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

760
00:43:18,138 --> 00:43:22,059
Over here. <i>Romeo and Juliet,</i> yeah?
I read that in high school.

761
00:43:22,142 --> 00:43:25,145
That's... That's Shakespeare, right?

762
00:43:25,229 --> 00:43:28,232
No, it's Zeffirelli,
the director of the movie.

763
00:43:28,315 --> 00:43:31,402
- You know, the movie? Film.
- Yeah.

764
00:43:31,485 --> 00:43:33,904
You know what?
What I never understood

765
00:43:33,988 --> 00:43:35,823
about that <i>Romeo and Juliet,</i>

766
00:43:35,948 --> 00:43:39,243
I never understood why Romeo,
he took the poison so quick, you know?

767
00:43:39,326 --> 00:43:41,996
I feel like he could have waited
or something.

768
00:43:42,121 --> 00:43:45,124
Well, that's the way
they took the poison in those days.

769
00:43:47,001 --> 00:43:49,420
Hey, you gonna eat?
Here, look at a menu.

770
00:43:49,503 --> 00:43:52,423
No, no. I'll just have tea.
Tea with lemon.

771
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:57,011
I started drinking tea recently, you know.
It's really a lot more refined.

772
00:43:57,136 --> 00:43:58,846
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

773
00:43:58,971 --> 00:44:00,431
All those women executives
in my office,

774
00:44:00,514 --> 00:44:02,016
they all drink tea with lemon.

775
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:05,602
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. And you notice that I do, too.

776
00:44:05,686 --> 00:44:09,023
- I like coffee, you know? I drink coffee.
- Yeah.

777
00:44:12,526 --> 00:44:16,196
You see, like, I've only been
at this agency a really short time,

778
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:20,951
but already I'm functioning in a, kind of,
public relations capacity, you know.

779
00:44:21,035 --> 00:44:23,704
I fill in for the agents
when they're elsewhere.

780
00:44:23,787 --> 00:44:26,206
Like, this week, you know, I had...

781
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:29,209
I had business lunches
with Eric Clapton at La Cote Basque

782
00:44:29,334 --> 00:44:32,379
- and Cat Stevens at Le Madrigal.
- Oh, far out.

783
00:44:32,463 --> 00:44:35,883
Yeah. You heard of
those restaurants, huh?

784
00:44:35,966 --> 00:44:39,970
No, I don't know
those exact restaurants.

785
00:44:40,054 --> 00:44:41,221
I know the type.

786
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:43,474
Yeah, but you must have heard
of the artists.

787
00:44:43,557 --> 00:44:46,477
No, I... Not... I don't know... You know.

788
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,978
Not really.

789
00:44:48,687 --> 00:44:50,647
So what did you say "far out" for, huh?

790
00:44:50,731 --> 00:44:53,233
'Cause it sounded, like, far out.
Wasn't it? I mean...

791
00:44:53,317 --> 00:44:56,403
- Well, yeah.
- We'd like a lemon with some tea now.

792
00:44:56,528 --> 00:45:00,032
And I'd like a cheeseburger
and some coffee.

793
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,082
Hey, you know who came
in the office the other day?

794
00:45:08,207 --> 00:45:10,250
- Who?
- Laurence Olivier.

795
00:45:10,334 --> 00:45:11,502
Who's that?

796
00:45:11,585 --> 00:45:14,838
Who's Laurence Olivier?
You don't know who he is?

797
00:45:14,922 --> 00:45:16,256
Laurence Olivier, man!

798
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:18,509
He's the greatest actor
in the whole world.

799
00:45:18,592 --> 00:45:20,677
Oh, come on, you know who he is.

800
00:45:20,761 --> 00:45:21,929
He's the English actor,

801
00:45:22,054 --> 00:45:25,015
the one on television who does
all those Polaroid commercials.

802
00:45:25,099 --> 00:45:27,351
You know, Laurence Olivier.

803
00:45:27,434 --> 00:45:30,187
- Oh, him. Oh, he's good. He is good.
- Yeah.

804
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:32,022
Well, anyway,
he comes in the office, right?

805
00:45:32,106 --> 00:45:33,690
So, I just do a few errands for him.

806
00:45:33,774 --> 00:45:35,943
So, he goes around,
he tells everybody in the entire office,

807
00:45:36,026 --> 00:45:37,277
he says I'm the brightest,

808
00:45:37,361 --> 00:45:40,948
I'm the most vivacious thing
in the entire office he's seen in years.

809
00:45:41,031 --> 00:45:42,449
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

810
00:45:42,574 --> 00:45:47,204
Do you think that you could get, like,
a camera from him at a discount?

811
00:45:47,287 --> 00:45:49,957
I didn't ask him about a camera.

812
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,126
'Cause you got one already, right,
you sly fox, you.

813
00:45:52,251 --> 00:45:54,211
Hey, look, are you enjoying
all this stuff I'm telling you?

814
00:45:54,294 --> 00:45:55,629
Sure. I think it's good.

815
00:45:55,754 --> 00:45:58,132
Well, I just think maybe you can't handle
hearing about a kind of life

816
00:45:58,257 --> 00:46:01,301
that is so completely different
than yours.

817
00:46:01,426 --> 00:46:04,805
- You mean "better," don't you?
- Yes, I mean better. Sure, it's better.

818
00:46:04,888 --> 00:46:06,640
Can I have some ketchup, please?

819
00:46:06,723 --> 00:46:08,559
I mean, I'm out of this scene
almost completely,

820

I'm moving into Manhattan.

821

I'm getting my own apartment.

822

any idea how much I'm growing.

825

827
00:46:27,828 --> 00:46:30,581
Okay, listen. I like you.
We could dance together.

828
00:46:30,664 --> 00:46:33,167
That's it. We could just dance together
and nothing more.

829
00:46:33,292 --> 00:46:35,419
Nothing personal.
I don't want you coming on to me.

830
00:46:35,502 --> 00:46:36,587
Why not?

831
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:39,173
Because I don't date guys
like you anymore, for one thing.

832
00:46:39,298 --> 00:46:41,425
You're too young,
you haven't got any class, and, yeah,

833
00:46:41,508 --> 00:46:44,094
I'm sick of jerk-off guys
ain't got their shit together!

834
00:46:44,178 --> 00:46:46,847
Oh, come on.
It's easy to get your shit together.

835
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:50,350
All you need is a salad bowl
and a potato masher.

836
00:46:51,185 --> 00:46:52,936
Get your shit together.

837
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:55,606
- Would you like to know what I do?
- It's not necessary.

838
00:46:55,689 --> 00:46:57,441
I'll tell you what I do.

839
00:46:57,524 --> 00:47:00,694
I work in a paint store,
and I got a raise this week.

840
00:47:00,819 --> 00:47:02,613
Right. You work in a paint store, right?

841
00:47:02,696 --> 00:47:04,948
You probably live with your family,
you hang out with your buddies,

842
00:47:05,032 --> 00:47:07,951
and on Saturday night you go,
you blow it all off at 2001, right?

843
00:47:08,035 --> 00:47:10,704
- That's right.
- You're a cliché.

844
00:47:10,787 --> 00:47:13,665
You're nowhere,
on your way to no place.

845
00:47:17,336 --> 00:47:19,796
What do you got?
A fucking stairway to the stars or what?

846
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,131
- Yeah, maybe.
- Yeah.

847
00:47:21,215 --> 00:47:22,799
I'm taking a course, nights,
at the new school.

848
00:47:22,883 --> 00:47:24,551
Next semester, I'm gonna take two.

849
00:47:24,676 --> 00:47:26,386
Now, you, you probably
didn't get no college, did you?

850
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:27,721
No, I did not.

851
00:47:27,804 --> 00:47:29,640
Well, did you ever think
about going to college?

852
00:47:29,723 --> 00:47:31,058
- No.
- Not ever?

853
00:47:31,183 --> 00:47:32,976
- No. Did you?
- Well, not back then, no...

854
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:34,978
Then why the fuck
are you bugging me about it for?

855
00:47:35,062 --> 00:47:37,147
Well, why not? Why didn't
you ever want to go to college?

856
00:47:37,231 --> 00:47:39,733
- Oh, just fuck off, will you? I did not.
- No, really. Tell me. Why not?

857
00:47:39,858 --> 00:47:42,027
Oh, Jesus Christ! I didn't!

858
00:47:46,531 --> 00:47:49,493
The thing is
the high I get at 2001 is just dancing,

859
00:47:49,576 --> 00:47:52,913
it's not being the best
or nothing like that.

860
00:47:53,038 --> 00:47:55,499
The only thing is
that I would like to get that high

861
00:47:55,582 --> 00:47:58,752
someplace else in my life. You know?

862
00:47:58,835 --> 00:48:00,420
Like where?

863
00:48:00,504 --> 00:48:03,924
I don't know where.
I don't know. Someplace.

864
00:48:04,049 --> 00:48:06,927
You see, dancing, it can't last forever.

865
00:48:07,052 --> 00:48:09,596
It's a short-lived kind of thing.

866
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,099
But I'm getting older, you know.

867
00:48:13,725 --> 00:48:14,768
You know, I feel like...

868
00:48:14,851 --> 00:48:16,770
I feel like, you know,
so what, I'm getting older.

869
00:48:16,853 --> 00:48:19,439
Does that mean, like, I can't feel
that way about nothing left in my life?

870
00:48:19,523 --> 00:48:21,358
You know? Is that it?

871
00:48:21,441 --> 00:48:24,027
Listen, we gotta split here.

872
00:48:24,111 --> 00:48:26,446
No, I'll walk you the rest of the way.

873
00:48:26,571 --> 00:48:30,200
No, I'll meet you at the dance studio,
just like we said, okay?

874
00:48:30,284 --> 00:48:31,952
Stephanie, I can walk you home.

875
00:48:32,077 --> 00:48:34,955
Look, nothing personal, right?

876
00:48:35,038 --> 00:48:37,791
Oh, come on, Stephanie. I can walk you.

877
00:48:39,126 --> 00:48:42,796
Oh, Jesus Christ! You know?

878
00:48:50,637 --> 00:48:51,972
I don't know where he is.

879
00:48:52,097 --> 00:48:53,974
- Did you call him?
- No.

880
00:48:58,645 --> 00:49:00,314
What's the matter? What's going on?

881
00:49:00,439 --> 00:49:03,233
It's Gus, man. He's in the hospital.
The spics got him.

882
00:49:03,317 --> 00:49:04,985
- Spanish Barons?
- Barracudas.

883
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:07,487
- Hey, that's my fucking car!
- Forget the car!

884
00:49:07,571 --> 00:49:09,489
- Save it for the spics.
- Just give me the keys.

885
00:49:09,614 --> 00:49:12,576
- You're asking for it.
- I can't believe it. I just saw him.

886
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:15,329
He could have run, you know?
But he hung tight. That's Gus.

887
00:49:15,454 --> 00:49:17,497
TONY: Don't worry about it.
Okay? All right?

888
00:49:17,622 --> 00:49:19,333
I got in the hospital to see him.

889
00:49:19,416 --> 00:49:22,919
He got a broken nose, busted ribs,
a broken leg and four teeth knocked out.

890
00:49:23,003 --> 00:49:24,087
Shit.

891
00:49:24,171 --> 00:49:26,923
I mean, all he was doing was walking
along the street carrying his groceries,

892
00:49:27,007 --> 00:49:28,675
and three of them
do a shove number on him.

893
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,178
They spill his fucking groceries
into the street.

894
00:49:31,303 --> 00:49:34,264
So, he says under his breath,
"grease balls, spic dicks,"

895
00:49:34,348 --> 00:49:35,682
and they laid into him.

896
00:49:37,434 --> 00:49:41,146
(CAR HONKING)

897
00:49:47,611 --> 00:49:49,780
TONY: All right. Go check it out.

898
00:50:07,547 --> 00:50:09,549
Nobody in there, man.

899
00:50:13,553 --> 00:50:15,222
All right, all right.
This is what we're gonna do.

900
00:50:15,305 --> 00:50:16,390
We're just gonna cruise around

901
00:50:16,515 --> 00:50:18,308
until there's enough of them
that we can handle.

902
00:50:18,392 --> 00:50:20,560
BOBBY: Yeah, yeah, we'll just pick
off a couple on the street.

903
00:50:20,644 --> 00:50:22,479
- That's pussy, man!
- Fuck, man. Fuck.

904
00:50:22,562 --> 00:50:25,732
- You're fucked up!
- I'm sorry, guys.

905
00:50:25,816 --> 00:50:28,819
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

906
00:50:28,902 --> 00:50:30,195
You're sorry.

907
00:50:30,737 --> 00:50:33,156
Oh, forget it. We'll get them tomorrow.

908
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:39,663
All right, dream good. Jerk off better.

909
00:50:42,416 --> 00:50:44,501
Tony, I'm getting married.

910
00:50:45,419 --> 00:50:46,753
Will you cut it with that shit?

911
00:50:46,837 --> 00:50:49,506
No, listen.
I just wanted to let you know, all right?

912
00:50:49,589 --> 00:50:51,007
All right. Look. If you get married,

913
00:50:51,091 --> 00:50:52,843
we'll all go with you
on your honeymoon, all right?

914
00:50:52,926 --> 00:50:56,263
- You will? Okay.
- Okay, good. Take it easy.

915
00:50:56,388 --> 00:50:58,849
Come on, Bobby. Get in the car.

916
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:00,934
Hey.

917
00:51:01,059 --> 00:51:03,687
Hey, you know,
we should go to the hospital tomorrow.

918
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:05,439
You know what I'm talking?

919
00:51:05,564 --> 00:51:09,025
And you, cool off! You know?

920
00:51:09,109 --> 00:51:11,069
All right. Good night.

921
00:51:34,217 --> 00:51:36,803
Tony, what did you say
to Father Frank, Jr.?

922
00:51:36,928 --> 00:51:39,139
- What?
- What did you say? What did you do?

923
00:51:39,264 --> 00:51:40,557
Yeah, what did you say?

924
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,644
- What are you talking about?
- You must have said something to him.

925
00:51:44,728 --> 00:51:46,271
You sleep in the same room.
You talk to him.

926
00:51:46,354 --> 00:51:48,440
The next night he stays out all night,
he don't come back.

927
00:51:48,523 --> 00:51:51,443
- I said nothing to him.
- A priest staying out all night.

928
00:51:51,526 --> 00:51:52,944
A priest is not a priest no more,

929
00:51:53,028 --> 00:51:55,197
and he's grown up,
so he can do what he wants.

930
00:51:55,322 --> 00:51:57,115
Something you said to him.

931
00:51:57,199 --> 00:51:59,659
Oh, yeah? You try and blame me
now he ain't a priest no more?

932
00:51:59,784 --> 00:52:01,453
You been writing to him.

933
00:52:01,536 --> 00:52:04,706
I don't believe this.
You're trying to hang this on me?

934
00:52:06,041 --> 00:52:08,793
Forget it, all right?
He called. He called. He called.

935
00:52:08,877 --> 00:52:11,963
In a couple of days
he's gonna see he's wrong.

936
00:52:12,047 --> 00:52:14,966
He's going through, like,
a trial of the soul, you know?

937
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:16,718
He's going back to the church.
He's going back.

938
00:52:16,843 --> 00:52:18,345
No, he won't.
He's not going back to the church.

939
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:19,804
Yes, he is.
He's going back to the church!

940
00:52:19,888 --> 00:52:21,681
I'm telling you, he's going back!

941
00:52:23,016 --> 00:52:24,851
You know what?
You don't got a priest no more!

942
00:52:24,976 --> 00:52:26,061
And you got no saint!

943
00:52:26,186 --> 00:52:28,230

I just...

948
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:49,626
I didn't mean that. I'm sorry.
I'll never say that.

- Okay.

952
00:53:09,896 --> 00:53:11,231
- That's good.
- Yeah.

953
00:53:11,356 --> 00:53:15,735
Hey, listen, look, Annette.
I gotta tell you something, all right?

954
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:18,822
It's very hard to tell you this, but...

955
00:53:18,905 --> 00:53:21,950
I changed my mind
about us dancing together.

956
00:53:22,075 --> 00:53:23,952
I got another partner.

957
00:53:27,581 --> 00:53:30,125
Look, it's professional.
You know what I mean? It's like...

958
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:33,420
Things like this happen
when it's professional.

959

00:54:07,078 --> 00:54:09,414
I don't know.
Six, seven, something like that.

- you know...
- Dispensation.

1181
01:06:21,354 --> 01:06:25,608
Yeah. Do you think the Pope
could give Pauline an abortion?

1182

a dispensation for an abortion?

You know? I didn't know how to do stuff,
so I'd go to him and I would ask him,

1481
01:23:40,683 --> 01:23:42,811
and he would tell me how to do things.

1482
01:23:42,894 --> 01:23:45,188
And then I'd go back to work
and everything would be all right.

1483
01:23:45,271 --> 01:23:47,148
Otherwise, I'd be walking around
like an idiot,

1484

I don't know."

1485

- Yeah, he helps you. Helps you what?

1486
01:23:51,569 --> 01:23:54,030
Get in and out of the sack?
Is that what he helps you do?

1487
01:23:54,114 --> 01:23:55,657
- He helped me.
- Sure.

1488
01:23:55,740 --> 01:23:58,034
What the hell do you
expect me to do, man?

1489

All right, so he helped you.
That's good for you.

We'll sit down. All right?

1498
01:24:38,032 --> 01:24:40,285
Don't stop. Just take me home.
Just take me home, man.

You know how tall that bridge is?

1504
01:25:15,862 --> 01:25:19,365
That bridge, that tower right there,
goes up 690 feet.

1505
01:25:20,074 --> 01:25:23,495
They got 40 million cars
going across there a year.

1506
01:25:23,828 --> 01:25:28,124
127,000 tons of steel is involved in that.

1507
01:25:29,167 --> 01:25:30,418
The concrete there,

1508
01:25:30,502 --> 01:25:34,464
they got almost three-quarter
of a million yards of concrete.

1509
01:25:34,547 --> 01:25:35,673
That's right.

1510
01:25:35,757 --> 01:25:40,386
The center span, right there,
is 4,260 feet long.

1511
01:25:40,470 --> 01:25:43,223
And with the on-ramps,
it all together totals, like,

1512
01:25:43,306 --> 01:25:45,725
something like 2.5 miles.

1513
01:25:47,143 --> 01:25:49,562
You know all about the bridge,
don't you?

1514
01:25:49,646 --> 01:25:51,523
That's right.

1515
01:25:51,606 --> 01:25:53,983
I know everything about that bridge.

1516
01:25:54,067 --> 01:25:58,112
You know what else?
They got a guy buried in the cement.

1517
01:25:58,863 --> 01:26:00,365
Yeah?

1518
01:26:01,324 --> 01:26:03,409
Know how it happened?

1519
01:26:03,493 --> 01:26:05,912
Well, they was working on it,
apparently, at the time.

1520
01:26:05,995 --> 01:26:09,165
And they, I guess,
they were pouring the cement,

1521
01:26:09,249 --> 01:26:10,792
and he slipped off, you know,

1522
01:26:10,875 --> 01:26:14,879
on the upper part of the bridge
and, you know, fell in.

1523
01:26:17,715 --> 01:26:19,217

1524
01:26:19,634 --> 01:26:21,844

01:57:33,089 --> 01:57:35,216
Okay, what kind of job?

1967
01:57:37,009 --> 01:57:38,845
I don't know.

1968
01:57:38,928 --> 01:57:41,013
What did you do? You came in,
you couldn't do nothing, right?

1969
01:57:41,097 --> 01:57:43,266
I could type when I came.

1970
01:57:45,518 --> 01:57:48,938
No big deal. I'm an able person.
I mean, I can do these things.

1971
01:57:49,021 --> 01:57:51,065
Yeah, of course you can.

1972
01:57:53,401 --> 01:57:55,987
Tony, I wanna tell you something.

1973
01:57:56,904 --> 01:58:00,241
Now, you know, I said
all that stuff to you about...

1974
01:58:01,159 --> 01:58:04,537
Using you,
practicing my act on you, you know?

1975
01:58:05,163 --> 01:58:06,664
It wasn't true.

1976
01:58:06,747 --> 01:58:10,001
There's a lot of other reasons
that I was hanging around you.

1977
01:58:10,084 --> 01:58:13,337
- What do you mean?
- You made me feel better.

1978
01:58:14,922 --> 01:58:18,301
You gave me, like, admiration,
you know? Respect.

1979
01:58:19,385 --> 01:58:20,720
Support.

1980
01:58:25,266 --> 01:58:29,604
Stephanie, maybe now that, you know,
like, I'm gonna be in town like I planned,

1981
01:58:29,687 --> 01:58:32,440
maybe, like, we could see each other.

1982
01:58:33,733 --> 01:58:36,903
No, I don't mean like that.
I know what you're thinking.

1983
01:58:36,986 --> 01:58:39,780
You're thinking, like,
I'm promoting your pussy, but I ain't.

1984
01:58:39,864 --> 01:58:41,574
I mean, like, friends, right?

1985
01:58:41,657 --> 01:58:44,869
You know, like you once said,
we could help each other.

1986
01:58:44,952 --> 01:58:48,748
- Wanna be friends?
- Yeah. I'd like to be friends with you.

1987
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,461
Think you know how, huh?

1988
01:58:53,544 --> 01:58:55,296
Think you could be friends with a girl?

1989
01:58:55,379 --> 01:58:58,341
Could you stand
being friends with a girl, huh?

1990
01:58:59,300 --> 01:59:00,676
- The truth?
- Yeah.

1991
01:59:00,760 --> 01:59:01,802
I don't know.

1992
01:59:01,886 --> 01:59:03,095
(BOTH LAUGHING)

1993
01:59:03,179 --> 01:59:04,305
I don't know. I mean, I could try.

1994
01:59:04,388 --> 01:59:07,225
That's all I can say, Stephanie.
I could try.

1995
01:59:13,314 --> 01:59:15,358
Okay. Okay.

1996
01:59:16,442 --> 01:59:19,737
Let's be friends, all right?
We'll just be friends.

1997
01:59:21,030 --> 01:59:22,406
TONY: All right.

1998
01:59:23,491 --> 01:59:24,575
Okay.

1999
01:59:26,702 --> 01:59:28,246
(STEPHANIE CHUCKLING)

2000
01:59:29,205 --> 01:59:30,706
STEPHANIE: Friends, man.

2001
01:59:31,958 --> 01:59:36,087
<i>I know your eyes in the morning sun</i>

2002
01:59:36,170 --> 01:59:39,882
<i>I feel you touch me in the pouring rain</i>

2003
01:59:41,175 --> 01:59:45,763
<i>And the moment
That you wander far from me</i>

2004
01:59:45,846 --> 01:59:50,309
<i>I wanna feel you in my arms again</i>

2005
01:59:50,393 --> 01:59:54,814
<i>And you come to me
On a summer breeze</i>

2006
01:59:54,897 --> 01:59:59,527
<i>Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave</i>

2007
01:59:59,610 --> 02:00:03,447
<i>And it's me you need to show</i>

2008
02:00:03,531 --> 02:00:04,907
<i>How deep is your love</i>

2009
02:00:04,991 --> 02:00:09,453
<i>How deep is your love
How deep is your love</i>

2010
02:00:09,537 --> 02:00:12,999
<i>I really need to learn</i>

2011
02:00:13,082 --> 02:00:17,503
<i>'Cause we're living in a world of fools</i>

2012
02:00:17,586 --> 02:00:20,339
<i>Breaking us down</i>

2013
02:00:20,423 --> 02:00:24,010
<i>When they all should let us be</i>

2014
02:00:24,927 --> 02:00:28,681
<i>We belong to you and me</i>

2015
02:00:28,764 --> 02:00:31,225
<i>I believe in you</i>

2016
02:00:31,309 --> 02:00:36,230
<i>You know the door to my very soul</i>

2017
02:00:36,397 --> 02:00:40,985
<i>You're the light
In my deepest, darkest hour</i>

2018
02:00:41,110 --> 02:00:44,864
<i>You're my savior when I fall</i>

2019
02:00:45,781 --> 02:00:50,202
<i>And you may not think
I care for you</i>

2020
02:00:50,286 --> 02:00:54,999
<i>When you know down inside
That I really do</i>

2021
02:00:55,082 --> 02:00:58,586
<i>And it's me you need to show</i>

2022
02:00:59,003 --> 02:01:00,338
<i>How deep is your love</i>

2023
02:01:00,421 --> 02:01:04,842
<i>How deep is your love
How deep is your love</i>

2024
02:01:04,925 --> 02:01:07,386
<i>Well, you can tell
By the way I use my walk</i>

2025

<i>I'm a woman's man
No time to talk</i>

And women warm</i>

Since I was born</i>

It's okay</i>
