00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:17,786
Aah!

Mahtim!

7
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,989
MILO: Good afternoon,
gentlemen.

8
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:37,533
First off, I'd like
to thank this board...

9
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,827
for taking the time
to hear my proposal.

10
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,995
Now, we've all heard
of the legend of Atlantis...

11
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:44,331
a continent somewhere
in the mid-Atlantic...

12
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:46,458
that was home
to an advanced civilization...

13
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,002
possessing technology
far beyond our own...

14
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:51,380
that, according
to our friend Plato here...

15
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:53,841
was suddenly struck
by some cataclysmic event...

16
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,509
that sank it
beneath the sea.

17
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:58,429
Now, some of you may ask,
why Atlantis?

18
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,055
It's just a myth, isn't it?

19
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:01,348
Pure fantasy.

20
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,768
Well, that is
where you'd be wrong.

21
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,895
10,000 years
before the Egyptians...

22
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:07,896
built the pyramids...

23
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:10,983
Atlantis had electricity,
advanced medicine...

24
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,193
even the power of flight.
Impossible, you say?

25
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:14,862
Well, no.
No, not for them.

26
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,864
Numerous ancient cultures
all over the globe agree...

27
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,783
that Atlantis possessed
a power source of some kind...

28
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:22,202
more powerful than steam,
than... than coal.

29
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:23,495
More powerful than
our modern...

30
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:24,872
internal combustion engines.

31
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:28,625
Gentlemen, I propose
that we find Atlantis...

32
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,502
find that power source...

33
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,379
and bring it back
to the surface.

34
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:35,632
Now, this is a page
from an illuminated text...

35
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:38,886
that describes a book called
the Shepherd's Journal...

36
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,055
said to have been
a first-hand account...

37
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:43,390
of Atlantis
and its exact whereabouts.

38
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:46,477
Now, based on a centuries-old
translation of a Norse text...

39
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:49,229
historians have believed
the Journal resides in Ireland.

40
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:52,191
But after
comparing the text...

41
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,194
to the runes
on this Viking shield...

42
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,613
I found that
one of the letters...

43
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,156
had been mistranslated.

44
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:01,575
So, by changing this letter...

45
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:03,702
and inserting
the correct one...

46
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:05,079
we find that
the Shepherd's Journal...

47
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,705
the key to Atlantis...

48
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:10,709
lies not in Ireland,
gentlemen...

49
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,753
but in Iceland.

50
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:14,296
Uhh!

51
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:15,756
[Softly]
Pause for effect.

52
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:19,301

I'll take your questions now.

please excuse me for a moment?

I plotted the route...

00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,430
that will take myself
and a crew...

00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,640

to retrieve the Journal.

180
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,261
It's for you.

181
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:57,056
It's... it's from my grandfather.

182
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,766
He brought that package
to me years ago.

183
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,601
He said if anything
were to happen to him...

184
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:01,602
I should give it to you...

185
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:02,603
when you were ready...

186
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:05,272
whatever that means.

187
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:07,107
MILO: It...

188
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:09,943
It can't be.
It's the Shepherd's Journal.

189
00:10:09,995 --> 00:10:12,738
Mr. Whitmore,
this journal is the key...

190
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,282
to finding the lost
continent of Atlantis!

191
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:18,410
Atlantis! Ha ha ha!
I wasn't born yesterday, son.

192
00:10:18,494 --> 00:10:19,745
No, no, no.
Look... look at this.

193
00:10:19,787 --> 00:10:22,247
Coordinates. Clues.
It's all right here.

194
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:23,957
Yeah, looks like
gibberish to me.

195
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:25,459
That's because it's
been written in a dialect...

196
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:26,835
that no longer exists.

197
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:29,077
- So it's useless.
- No, no, just difficult.

198
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,131
I've spent my whole life
studying dead languages.

199
00:10:31,183 --> 00:10:32,633
It's not gibberish to me.

200
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:33,884
Ah, it's probably a fake.

201
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,429
Mr. Whitmore, my grandfather
would have known...

202
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:39,431
if this were a fake.
I would know.

203
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:42,476
I will stake everything I own,
everything that I believe in...

204
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:44,603
that this is the genuine
Shepherd's Journal.

205
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:45,771
All right,
all right.

206
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:46,855
So what do you want
to do with it?

207
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:48,440
Well, I'll... I'll...
I'll get funding.

208
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:49,983
I mean, I'll... The museum...

209
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:50,984
WHITMORE: They'll
never believe you.

210
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:53,904
I'll show them!
I will make them believe.

211
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:54,947
Like you did today?

212
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,324
Yes! Well, no.
How did you...

213
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:59,201
Forget about them,
OK? Never mind!

214
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:01,120
I will find Atlantis
on my own.

215
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,913
I mean, if I have
to rent a rowboat!

216
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,708
Congratulations, Milo.

217
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:08,419
This is exactly
what I wanted to hear.

218
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,003
But forget the rowboat, son.

219
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:13,924
We'll travel in style.

220
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:19,638
It's all been arranged,
the whole ball of wax.

221
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:20,681
Why?

222
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:22,391
For years your granddad
bent my ear...

223
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:23,934
with stories
about that old book.

224
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:25,310
I didn't buy it for a minute.

225
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:26,603
So finally I got fed up...

226
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:27,855
and made a bet
with the old coot.

227
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,815
I said, "Thatch, if you
ever actually find...

228
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:30,858
"that so-called journal...

229
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,443
"not only will I
finance the expedition...

230
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:33,986
"but I'll kiss you
full on the mouth."

231
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,028
Lmagine my embarrassment...

232
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,406
when he found
the darn thing.

233
00:11:37,448 --> 00:11:39,533
Now I know your
grandfather's gone, Milo...

234
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:41,869
God rest his soul,
but Preston Whitmore...

235
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,287
is a man who keeps his word.

236
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:44,288
You hear that, Thatch?

237
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:45,456
I'm going to the afterlife...

238
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,791
with a clear conscience,
by thunder!

239
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,710
[Chuckles]

240
00:11:50,753 --> 00:11:51,920
[Sighs]

241
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:57,509
Your grandpa was a great man.

242
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:59,511
You probably don't
realize how great.

243
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:03,474
Those buffoons at the museum
dragged him down...

244
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:04,933
made a laughingstock of him.

245
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:07,853
He died a broken man.

246
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:11,231
If I could bring back
just one shred of proof...

247
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:12,733
that'd be enough for me.

248
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:16,612
Ah, Thatch.

249
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,072
What are we
standing around for?

250
00:12:18,124 --> 00:12:19,114
We got work to do.

251
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:20,699
But, Mr. Whitmore, you know,
in order to do...

252
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:22,409
what you're proposing,
you're gonna need a crew.

253
00:12:22,461 --> 00:12:23,358
Taken care of!

254
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,412
You'll need engineers
and... and geologists.

255
00:12:25,464 --> 00:12:27,414
WHITMORE: Got 'em all.
The best of the best.

256
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:29,958
Gaetan Moliere,
geology and excavation.

257
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,502
The man
has a nose for dirt.

258
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:33,253
Vincenzo Santorini,
demolitions.

259
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:35,464
Busted him out
of a Turkish prison.

260
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:37,174
Audrey Ramirez.
Don't let her age fool you.

261
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:38,509
She's forgotten more
about engines...

262
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,052
than you or I will ever know.

263
00:12:40,094 --> 00:12:41,845
They're the same crew that
brought the Journal back.

264
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:42,846
Where was it?

265
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:44,556
WHITMORE: Iceland.

266
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,558
I knew it!
I knew it!

267
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:49,686
All we need now is
an expert in gibberish.

268
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,647
So it's decision time.

269
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,732
You can build on the foundation
your grandfather left you...

270
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:55,776
or you can go back
to your boiler room.

271
00:12:58,654 --> 00:13:01,240
- This is for real.
- Now you're catching on.

272
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,951
All right. OK. I-I-I'll
have to quit my job.

273
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:05,703
It's done.
You resigned this afternoon.

274
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:06,704
MILO: I did?
WHITMORE: Yep.

275
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:07,705
Don't like
to leave loose ends.

276
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:09,331
Um, my apartment.
I have to give notice.

277
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:10,916
- Taken care of.
- My clothes?

278
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,126
- Packed.
- My books?

279
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:13,794
- In storage.
- My cat?

280
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:15,629
[Meow]

281
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:16,880
My gosh.

282
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,799
Your granddad had a saying.

283
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:20,134
"Our lives are remembered...

284
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:22,386
by the gifts
we leave our children."

285
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,765
This journal
is his gift to you, Milo.

286
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:30,394
Atlantis is waiting.
What do you say?

287
00:13:30,436 --> 00:13:32,646
I'm your man, Mr. Whitmore.

288
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:34,022
You will not regret this.

289
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:38,110
Boy, I am so excited,
l-I-I-I can't even hold it in.

290
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:39,862
[Ship's horn blows]

291
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:47,244
Carrots.
Why is there always carrots?

292
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:48,787
I didn't even eat carrots.

293
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:51,999
PACKARD: Attention.
All hands to the launch bay.

294
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:55,002
To whoever took the "L"
from the Motor Pool sign...

295
00:13:55,044 --> 00:13:57,755
ha ha, we are
all very amused.

296
00:13:57,796 --> 00:14:00,674
Excuse me?
I need to, uh, report in?

297
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:02,009
Yes, Mr. Thatch?

298
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:03,635
Aah!
Uh, it's you!

299
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,596
Blondie, I got a bone
to pick with you.

300
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:06,638
Hold that thought.

301
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:08,223
What is it this time, Cookie?

302
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:11,894
You done stuffed my wagon full
to bustin' with non-essentials.

303
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:16,356
Look at all this...
cinnamon, oregano, cilantro.

304
00:14:16,408 --> 00:14:19,651
What in the cockadoodle
is cilantro?

305
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,028
And what is this?

306
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,154
That would be lettuce.

307
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:24,323
Lettuce? Lettuce?!

308
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,148
It's a vegetable, Cookie.

309
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,993
The men need
the four basic food groups.

310
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:30,078
I got your
four basic food groups!

311
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,122
Beans, bacon, whiskey, and lard!

312
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:33,290
[Warning alarm sounds]

313
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:35,667
All right, cowboy.
Pack it up and move it out.

314
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:38,921
PACKARD: Attention.
All hands to the launch bay.

315
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:41,006
Final loading in progress.

316
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,841
[Elevator starts]

317
00:14:51,183 --> 00:14:52,393
VINNY: [ltalian accent]
Hey, Junior.

318
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:54,311
If you're lookin'
for the pony rides...

319
00:14:54,353 --> 00:14:55,896
they're back there.

320
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:57,231
Excuse me.
Excuse me?

321
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:59,858
You dropped
your dy-dy-dy-dynamite.

322
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:00,943
Heh heh heh.

323
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:03,570
What else have you,
uh, got in there?

324
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:08,534
Oh, eh, gunpowder,
nitroglycerin, notepads...

325
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:11,912
fuses, wicks, glue, and...

326
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:13,706
paper clips.
Big ones.

327
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:16,625
You know, just,
uh, office supplies.

328
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:17,960
Milo! Where you been?

329
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,253
I want you to meet
Commander Rourke.

330
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:21,588
He led the Iceland team
that brought the Journal back.

331
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,090
Milo Thatch.

332
00:15:23,132 --> 00:15:25,592
Pleasure to meet the grandson
of old Thaddeus.

333
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:28,303
I see you got that journal.
Nice pictures, but...

334
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:30,305
I prefer a good western myself.

335
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:31,432
Pretty impressive, eh?

336
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:34,935
Boy, when you settle a bet,
y-you settle a bet.

337
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:36,603
Well, your granddad
always believed...

338
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:38,981
you couldn't put a price
on the pursuit of knowledge.

339
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:41,483
Well, uh, believe me
this'll be small change...

340
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:42,609
compared to the value
of what we're gonna...

341
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:43,736
learn on this trip.

342
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,113
Yes, this should be
enriching for all of us.

343
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:47,865
PACKARD: Attention,
all personnel.

344
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:50,951
Launch will commence
in 15 minutes.

345
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:52,369
- Mr. Whitmore.
- Rourke.

00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:53,370
ROURKE:
It's time.

347
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:56,623
- Bye, Mr. Whitmore!
- Make us proud, boy!

DIVING OFFICER:
Rig ship for dive!

349
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,084
CHIEF OF THE WATCH:
Aye, sir! Rig ship for dive.

350
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:01,045
Lieutenant, take her down.

351
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:02,629

PACKARD: Attention.

358
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:56,558
Tonight's supper
will be baked beans.

00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:07,152
Aah!

363
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:10,812
You have disturbed the dirt.

364
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:13,158
- Uh, pardon me?
- You have disturbed the dirt!

365
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,536
Dirt from around the globe,
spanning the centuries!

366
00:17:15,588 --> 00:17:17,162
[Gasps] What have you done?

367
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:19,415
England must never
merge with France!

368
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:21,750
- What's it doin' in my bed?
- You ask too many questions.

369
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:23,210
Who are you?
Who sent you? Speak up!

Hey, hey, hey!
Let go!

00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:29,007
Do not be such a crybaby.
Hold still.

Aha! There you are.

00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:33,887
Now tell me your story,
my little friend.

377
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:38,892
of a type used
in government buildings.

378
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:40,144

two years old,
third in a litter of seven.

380
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:44,356
There are all
the microscopic fingerprints...

381
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:45,816
of the mapmaker.

382

Moliere, now what
have I told you...

387
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,038
about playing nice
with the other kids?

388
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,373
Get back. I've got soap,
and I'm not afraid to use it.

390
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,459
Back, foul creature!

391
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,044

- Oh, boy.
- Nice, isn't it?

399
00:18:15,387 --> 00:18:16,680
The catalog says
that this little beauty...

400
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:18,557
can saw through a femur
in 28 seconds.

401
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,100
I'm bettin' I can
cut that time in half.

402
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:21,643
Now, stick out your
tongue and say "ahh."

405
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:25,773
Really? I have
family up that way.

406
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:27,649
Beautiful country up there.
Do you do any fishing?

407
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:29,057
[Garbled speech]

408
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,778
Me? I hate fishing.
I hate fish.

409
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:31,779
Hate the taste,
hate the smell...

410
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,238
and hate all them

411
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,240

please report to the bridge?

414
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:40,412
Thank you.

415
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:43,082
I mean, uh, uh,
nice meeting you.

416
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:44,333
Uh-huh. Nice meeting you, too.

417
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:51,757
So I says to him,
"What's wrong with my meatloaf?"

418
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:53,467
And he says to me... Oh.

419
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:56,178
Hold on a second, Margie,
I got another call.

420
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,597
Sir, we're approaching
coordinates.

421
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:00,641
Hello, Margie?
Yeah, so anyways, he says...

422
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:02,309
ROURKE: All right,
let's have a look around.

423
00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:04,395
HELGA: Aye, sir.
Set course to 2-4-0.

424
00:19:04,436 --> 00:19:06,355
15 degrees down angle
on the bow planes.

425
00:19:06,397 --> 00:19:08,232
Come right 2-4-0.

426
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,360
Welcome to the bridge,
Mr. Thatch.

427
00:19:11,402 --> 00:19:12,486
OK, everybody...

428
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:14,238
I want you
to give Mr. Thatch...

429
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:15,739
your undivided attention.

430
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,118
Good afternoon.
Can everyone hear me OK?

431
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:25,207
Heh, OK, uh, how...
how 'bout some slides?

432
00:19:25,249 --> 00:19:28,001
The... the first slide is
a depiction of a creature.

433
00:19:28,053 --> 00:19:29,712
A creature so frightening...

434
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:31,505
that sailors were said
to be driven mad...

435
00:19:31,557 --> 00:19:33,382
by the mere sight of it.

436
00:19:33,424 --> 00:19:35,342
PACKARD: Hubba, hubba.

437
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:37,845
Uh, I'm sorry.
That's... wrong.

438
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,722
[Spanish accent] Geez,
I used to take lunch money...

439
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:40,889
from guys like this.

440
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:42,391
Anyway, this, uh... OK.

441
00:19:42,433 --> 00:19:45,310
This is an illustration
of the Leviathan...

442
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:47,813
the creature guarding
the entrance to Atlantis.

443
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:49,304
With something like that...

444
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:51,692
I would have white wine,
I think.

445
00:19:51,744 --> 00:19:53,318
It's a mythical sea serpent.

446
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,820
He's described
in the Book of Job.

447
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:55,988
The... the Bible says...

448
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,614
"Out of his mouth
go burning lights...

449
00:19:57,656 --> 00:19:59,366
sparks of fire shoot out."

450
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:01,493
But more likely it's
a carving or a sculpture...

451
00:20:01,535 --> 00:20:02,536
to frighten
the superstitious.

452
00:20:02,578 --> 00:20:05,080
So we find this masterpiece.
Then what?

453
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:06,488
When do we dig?

454
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,750
Actually, we don't have to dig.

455
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,157
You see, according
to the Journal...

456
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,211
the path to Atlantis
will take us down a tunnel...

457
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:13,547
at the bottom of the ocean,
and we'll come up a curve...

458
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:15,215
into an air pocket
right here...

459
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:16,592
where we'll find
the remnants...

460
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:18,719
of an ancient highway
that will lead us to Atlantis.

461
00:20:18,761 --> 00:20:20,345
Kind of like the grease trap
in your sink.

462
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:22,973
Cartographer, linguist, plumber.

463
00:20:23,015 --> 00:20:24,266
Hard to believe
he's still single.

464
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:26,935
- You said there'd be digging.
- Go away, Mole.

465
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:28,771
Captain, you'd better
come look at this, sir.

466
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:30,272
OK, class dismissed.

467
00:20:30,314 --> 00:20:31,899
Give me exterior lights.

468
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:41,241
Look at that.

469
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:43,369
There are ships here
from every era.

"There you will find the path

480
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:21,657
Yes, Mrs. Packard.
What is it?

481
00:21:21,699 --> 00:21:23,742
I'm picking up something
on the hydrophone...

482
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:26,120
- I think you should hear.
- Put it on speakers.

Uh-uh. Bigger.

486
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:39,925
It sounds metallic.

487
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:41,989
Could be an echo off
one of the rocks.

488
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:44,012
Do you want to do my job?
Be my guest.

489
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:45,973
Is it just me,
or is that getting louder?

490
00:21:51,145 --> 00:21:53,313
Well, whatever it was,
it's gone now.

00:23:29,368 --> 00:23:30,869
Move!
Where? Move where?

526
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:32,037
Packard, sound the alarm!

527
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:33,372
He took his suitcase?

528
00:23:33,414 --> 00:23:35,249
Marge, honey,
I don't think he's comin' back.

529
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,084
- Packard!
- I have to call you back.

530
00:23:37,126 --> 00:23:38,711
No, no, I'll call you.

531
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,879
[Alarm sounds]

532
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:43,132
PACKARD: All hands,
abandon ship.

533
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:45,968
Move it, people!
Sometime today would be nice!

534
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:48,804
Come on! Everybody grab
a seat and buckle in.

535
00:23:48,846 --> 00:23:50,764
Lieutenant,
get us out of here!

536
00:23:53,976 --> 00:23:54,935
ROURKE: Lieutenant!

537
00:23:54,977 --> 00:23:56,186
HELGA: I'm working on it!

538
00:23:57,104 --> 00:23:58,522
[Roars]

539
00:24:05,154 --> 00:24:06,238
Hang on.

540
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,001
Where to, Mr. Thatch?

541
00:24:19,043 --> 00:24:21,545
We're looking for a big
crevice of some kind.

542
00:24:21,587 --> 00:24:22,744
There! Up ahead.

543
00:24:22,796 --> 00:24:25,007
All craft, make your mark
20 degrees down angle.

544
00:24:25,049 --> 00:24:27,259
Roger! 20 degrees down angle.

545
00:24:27,301 --> 00:24:28,635
Right behind you!

546
00:24:31,555 --> 00:24:32,514
MOLE: Sacre bleu!

547
00:24:32,556 --> 00:24:34,016
MAN: We're getting killed
out here!

548
00:24:44,026 --> 00:24:45,486
Look out!

549
00:24:48,822 --> 00:24:50,240
It's only a grease trap.
It's just like a sink.

550
00:24:50,282 --> 00:24:52,326
It's only a grease trap.
It's just like a sink!

551
00:25:48,924 --> 00:25:51,802
Seven hours ago,
we started this expedition...

552
00:25:51,844 --> 00:25:55,139
with 200 of the finest
men and women I've ever known.

553
00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:57,433
We're all that's left.

554
00:25:57,474 --> 00:25:59,643
I won't sugar-coat it,
gentlemen.

555
00:25:59,685 --> 00:26:01,812
We have a crisis on our hands.

556
00:26:01,854 --> 00:26:04,022
But we've been up this
particular creek before...

557
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:07,192
and we've always come through,
paddle or no paddle.

558
00:26:07,234 --> 00:26:09,570
I see no reason
to change that policy now.

559
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:12,573
From here on in,
everyone pulls double duty.

560
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:15,701
Everyone drives,
everyone works.

561
00:26:15,743 --> 00:26:17,995
Looks like all our chances
for survival...

562
00:26:18,037 --> 00:26:19,246
rest with you, Mr. Thatch.

563
00:26:19,288 --> 00:26:21,373
You and that little book.

564
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:23,584
We're all gonna die.

565
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:25,033
ROURKE: OK, people.
Saddle up.

566
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:28,088
Lieutenant, I want this convoy
moving five minutes ago.

567
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,298
Moliere, you're on point.

568
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:31,383
No, Vinney,
Audrey's taking the oiler.

569
00:26:31,425 --> 00:26:32,801
You know the rules.
I want you 50 yards...

570
00:26:32,843 --> 00:26:34,543
behind that truck at all times.

571
00:26:34,595 --> 00:26:35,596
And, Packard,
put out that cigarette.

572
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,545
[Beep]

573
00:26:36,597 --> 00:26:38,891
[Beep beep]

574
00:26:38,932 --> 00:26:40,684
[Beep beep beep]

575
00:26:40,726 --> 00:26:41,769
[Beep beep beep]

576
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,313
[Squeak]

577
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:47,066
Are you sure you're checked
out on this class of vehicle?

578
00:26:47,107 --> 00:26:49,276
- Uhh...
- Can you drive a truck?

579
00:26:49,318 --> 00:26:52,738
Pfft! Heh heh.
Of course I can drive a truck.

580
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,239
I mean, sure,
you got your steering...

581
00:26:54,281 --> 00:26:56,064
and your gas
and your brake...

582
00:26:56,116 --> 00:27:01,955
and, of course, this metal,
uh, looking... thing.

583
00:27:01,997 --> 00:27:03,999
OK, so it was a bumper car
at Coney Island...

584
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:05,459
but it's the same
basic principle!

585
00:27:05,511 --> 00:27:06,908
[Sighs]

586
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,462
[Brakes squeal]

587
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:13,926
[Horn beeps]
DRIVER: Come on!

588
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:15,094
MILO: Sorry abou...
sorry about that.

589
00:27:15,135 --> 00:27:16,553
SECOND DRIVER:
Come on, civilian!

590
00:27:16,595 --> 00:27:17,596
Oof.

591
00:28:13,152 --> 00:28:14,486
Ahh.

592
00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:15,863
You didn't just
drink that, did you?

593
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:16,905
- Mm-hmm.
- That's not good.

594
00:28:16,947 --> 00:28:18,156
That's nitroglycerin.

595
00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:19,366
- [Gags]
- Don't move.

596
00:28:19,408 --> 00:28:21,118
Eh, don't breathe.

597
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,288
Don't do anything,
except pray maybe.

598
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:25,330
- Boom!
- Aah!

599
00:28:25,372 --> 00:28:27,458
[Laughing]

600
00:28:46,268 --> 00:28:49,021
SWEET: [Chuckles]
Yeah.

601
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:04,244
MILO: Good night! Will you
look at the size of this!

602
00:29:04,296 --> 00:29:06,622
It's gotta be half a mile
high at least.

603
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:08,207
It... it must have
taken hundred...

604
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:11,085
no, pfft, thousands of years
to carve this thing.

605
00:29:11,137 --> 00:29:12,711
[Explosion]

606
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:17,466
Hey, look,
I made a bridge.

607
00:29:17,508 --> 00:29:19,259
It only took me,
like, what?

608
00:29:19,301 --> 00:29:21,553
10 seconds, 11, tops.

609
00:29:31,563 --> 00:29:33,607
[Chattering]

610
00:29:39,947 --> 00:29:41,990
Looks like we have
a little roadblock.

611
00:29:42,032 --> 00:29:43,575
Vinny,
what do you think?

612
00:29:43,617 --> 00:29:47,037
I could unroadblock that
if I had about 200 of these.

613
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:50,499
Problem is I only
got about... 10.

614
00:29:50,541 --> 00:29:52,584
Plus, you know,
five of my own...

615
00:29:52,626 --> 00:29:55,170
and a couple of cherry bombs...

616
00:29:55,212 --> 00:29:57,131
a road flare.

617
00:29:57,172 --> 00:30:00,259
Hey, too bad we don't have
some nitroglycerin, eh, Milo?

618
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,094
[Laughing hysterically]

619
00:30:02,136 --> 00:30:04,096
Looks like we're
gonna have to dig.

620
00:30:04,138 --> 00:30:05,305
[Gasps gleefully]

621
00:30:05,347 --> 00:30:07,474
It will be my pleasure.

622
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,982
Aah!

623
00:30:16,024 --> 00:30:16,984
[Backfires]

624
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:19,445
[Coughing]

625
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:21,280
[Beeps horn]
Oh! Stupid!

626
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:22,823
You are stupid!

627
00:30:23,824 --> 00:30:25,107
I don't understand it.

628
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:27,119
I just tuned this thing
up this morning.

629
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:28,120
Um...

630
00:30:28,162 --> 00:30:29,955
It looks like
the rotor's shot!

631
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:31,165
I'm gonna have
to pull a spare...

632
00:30:31,206 --> 00:30:32,374
from one
of the trucks.

633
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:34,126
- Can l...
- No toques nada!

634
00:30:34,168 --> 00:30:35,252
I'll be right back.

635
00:30:38,464 --> 00:30:40,007
[Hissing and groaning]

636
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,218
[Whoosh]

637
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,179
She lives!

638
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,056
Hey, what'd you do?

639
00:30:47,097 --> 00:30:49,224
Well, you know,
the boiler in this baby...

640
00:30:49,266 --> 00:30:51,602
is a Humac model P54/813.

641
00:30:51,643 --> 00:30:54,730
Now we got the 814
back at the museum.

642
00:30:54,772 --> 00:30:57,066
The heating cores
on the whole Humac line...

643
00:30:57,107 --> 00:30:59,151
have always been a little,
you know, temperamental...

644
00:30:59,193 --> 00:31:01,362
so sometimes you gotta... boom!

645
00:31:01,403 --> 00:31:02,488
Persuade 'em a little.

646
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:04,114
Yeah, yeah,
thank you very much.

647
00:31:04,156 --> 00:31:05,199
Shut up.

648
00:31:07,493 --> 00:31:09,119
Two for flinching.

649
00:31:09,161 --> 00:31:10,162
Ooh!

650
00:31:10,204 --> 00:31:11,789
[Mole laughing]

651
00:31:16,293 --> 00:31:19,046
This is it.
It's gotta be.

652
00:31:19,088 --> 00:31:21,507
ROURKE: All right,
we'll make camp here.

653
00:31:21,548 --> 00:31:22,549
Why is it glowing?

654
00:31:22,591 --> 00:31:25,677
Pah! It is a natural
phosphorescence.

655
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:29,139
That thing is going to keep me
up all night, I know it.

656
00:31:29,181 --> 00:31:30,641
[Triangle jangling]
COOKIE: Come and get it!

657
00:31:31,683 --> 00:31:34,019
For the appetizer,
Caesar salad...

658
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:36,063
escargot...

659
00:31:36,105 --> 00:31:37,940
and your Oriental
spring rolls.

660
00:31:37,981 --> 00:31:39,983
- Yuck.
- I wanted the escargot.

661
00:31:40,025 --> 00:31:41,235
Knock yourself out.

662
00:31:42,069 --> 00:31:43,862
There you go, Milo.

663
00:31:43,904 --> 00:31:45,656
Put some meat
on them bones.

664
00:31:45,698 --> 00:31:48,659
Thanks, Cookie.
That looks greasier than usual.

665
00:31:48,701 --> 00:31:50,828
You like it?
Well, have some more.

666
00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:52,705
You're so skinny,
if you turned sideways...

667
00:31:52,746 --> 00:31:54,623
and stuck out your tongue
you'd look like a zipper.

668
00:31:54,665 --> 00:31:56,917
You know, we've been
pretty tough on the kid.

669
00:31:56,969 --> 00:31:58,252
What do you say
we cut him some slack?

670
00:31:58,304 --> 00:31:59,795
Yeah, you're right.

671
00:31:59,837 --> 00:32:01,964
Hey, Milo! Why don't
you come sit with us?

672
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:04,216
Really? You don't mind?

673
00:32:04,258 --> 00:32:05,592
Nah. Park it here.

674
00:32:05,634 --> 00:32:07,094
Gee, this is great.

675
00:32:07,136 --> 00:32:08,095
I mean, you know...

676
00:32:08,137 --> 00:32:09,763
it's an honor to be
included in your...

677
00:32:09,805 --> 00:32:11,390
[Pbbbt]

678
00:32:11,432 --> 00:32:13,892
[Laughing]

679
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:17,396
- Mole!
- Ah, forgive me.

680
00:32:17,438 --> 00:32:19,440
I could not resist.

681
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:21,567
Hey, Milo, don't you ever
close that book?

682
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:23,569
Yeah, you must've read it
a dozen times by now.

683
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:26,655
I know, but this... this
doesn't make any sense.

684
00:32:26,697 --> 00:32:28,615
See, in this passage
here, the shepherd...

685
00:32:28,657 --> 00:32:30,221
seems to be leading
up to something.

686
00:32:30,273 --> 00:32:31,785
He calls it
the heart of Atlantis.

687
00:32:31,827 --> 00:32:34,496
It could be the power source
the legends refer to.

688
00:32:34,538 --> 00:32:36,790
But then it just...
it cuts off.

689
00:32:36,832 --> 00:32:38,292
It's almost like
there's a missing page.

690
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:40,044
Kid, relax.

691
00:32:40,085 --> 00:32:41,420
We don't get paid overtime.

692
00:32:41,462 --> 00:32:42,796
I know, I know.

693
00:32:42,838 --> 00:32:44,715
Sometimes I get
a little carried away.

694
00:32:44,757 --> 00:32:46,800
But, hey, you know, that's what
this is all about, right?

695
00:32:46,842 --> 00:32:50,637
I mean, discovery,
teamwork, adventure.

696
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:52,806
Unless, maybe...

697
00:32:52,848 --> 00:32:55,934
you're just in it
for the money.

698
00:32:55,976 --> 00:32:57,019
- Money.
- Money.

699
00:32:57,061 --> 00:32:58,020
- Money.
- Money.

00:32:58,062 --> 00:32:59,928
I'm gonna say...
money.

701
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:03,525
[Sighs] Well, I guess I set
myself up for that one.

702

[Grunts]

703
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:05,778
What, is something
wrong with your neck?

704
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:07,905
Oh, yeah, I must've
hurt it when...

705
00:33:07,946 --> 00:33:08,947

Aah! Ow!

706
00:33:08,989 --> 00:33:10,115

707
00:33:10,157 --> 00:33:11,700
[Grunts] Yeah!

708
00:33:11,742 --> 00:33:13,827
Hey, how'd you learn
how to do that?

709
00:33:13,869 --> 00:33:15,871
- An Arapaho medicine man.
- Get outta here.

710
00:33:15,913 --> 00:33:17,081
Born and raised with 'em.

711
00:33:17,122 --> 00:33:18,165
My father was an army medic.

712
00:33:18,207 --> 00:33:20,292
He settled down
in the Kansas Territory...

713
00:33:20,334 --> 00:33:21,335
after he met my mother.

714
00:33:21,387 --> 00:33:22,284
No kidding.

715
00:33:22,336 --> 00:33:24,463
Nope. I got a sheepskin
from Howard U.

716
00:33:24,505 --> 00:33:26,632
And a bearskin
from old Iron Cloud.

717
00:33:26,673 --> 00:33:28,634
Halfway through medical school,
I was drafted.

718
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:31,136
One day I'm studying gross
anatomy in the classroom...

719
00:33:31,178 --> 00:33:33,680
the next I'm sewing up
Rough Riders on San Juan Hill.

720
00:33:33,722 --> 00:33:35,099

721
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,850

722

my weight.

723
00:33:37,935 --> 00:33:39,019
Ha ha ha, don't you worry.

724
00:33:39,061 --> 00:33:41,855
It'll keep
and keep and keep.

725
00:33:42,523 --> 00:33:45,359
Thank God I lost my sense
of taste years ago.

726
00:33:50,531 --> 00:33:52,408
Aren't you going
to pitch up your tent?

727
00:33:52,449 --> 00:33:54,201
Uh, I did.

728
00:33:55,869 --> 00:33:57,496
I guess I'm still
a little rusty at this.

729
00:33:57,538 --> 00:33:59,112
I haven't
gone camping since...

730
00:33:59,164 --> 00:34:00,749
well, the last time
my grandpa took me.

731
00:34:00,791 --> 00:34:02,835
I never got to meet
your grandfather.

732
00:34:02,876 --> 00:34:03,836
What was he like?

733
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:05,327
Where do you start?

734
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:07,329
He was like a father
to me, really.

735
00:34:07,381 --> 00:34:09,508
My parents died
when I was a little kid...

736
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,385
and he took me in.

737
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:15,431
- [Chuckles]
- What?

738
00:34:15,472 --> 00:34:17,161
Well, I was
just thinkin'.

739
00:34:17,213 --> 00:34:18,851
One time, when I was eight,

740
00:34:18,892 --> 00:34:20,269
we were hiking along
this stream...

741
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:23,689
and I saw something
shining in the water.

742
00:34:23,731 --> 00:34:25,514
It was a genuine arrowhead.

743
00:34:25,566 --> 00:34:28,152
Well, you'd think I'd found
a lost civilization...

744
00:34:28,193 --> 00:34:30,070
the way Grandpa
carried on about it.

745
00:34:30,112 --> 00:34:31,113
It wasn't
until I was older...

746
00:34:31,155 --> 00:34:32,531
that I realized
that the arrowhead...

747
00:34:32,573 --> 00:34:33,741
was just
some compressed shale...

748
00:34:33,782 --> 00:34:35,325
mixed with zinc pyrite
that had fractured...

749
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:36,785
into an isosceletic
triangulate.

750
00:34:36,827 --> 00:34:39,872
[Giggles]
That is so cute!

751
00:34:39,913 --> 00:34:42,541
Say, Audrey,
uh, no... no offense...

752
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:44,752
but how does a teenager
become the chief mechanic...

753
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:46,587
of a multimillion dollar
expedition?

754
00:34:46,628 --> 00:34:48,589
Well, I took this job
when my dad retired.

755
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,631
But the funny thing was...

756
00:34:49,673 --> 00:34:51,550
he always
wanted sons, right?

757
00:34:51,592 --> 00:34:53,427
One to run his machine
shop and the other...

758
00:34:53,479 --> 00:34:55,429
to be middleweight
boxing champion.

759
00:34:55,471 --> 00:34:57,806
But he got my sister
and me instead.

760
00:34:57,848 --> 00:35:00,559
So, what... what happened
to your sister?

761
00:35:00,601 --> 00:35:03,228
She's 24 and 0, with a shot
at the title next month.

762
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,397
Anyway, I'm saving up...

763
00:35:05,439 --> 00:35:07,441
so my Papí and I
can open another shop.

764
00:35:07,483 --> 00:35:09,443
Forget your jammies,
Mrs. Packard?

765
00:35:09,485 --> 00:35:11,236
I sleep in the nude.

want a pair of these.

767

Well, as far as me goes...

769
00:35:16,408 --> 00:35:18,369

to blow things up.

771
00:35:19,453 --> 00:35:20,996

772
00:35:22,456 --> 00:35:24,583
My family owned
a flower shop.

773
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:26,627
We would sell roses...

774
00:35:26,668 --> 00:35:30,089

you name it.

775
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,590
One day, I'm making...

776
00:35:31,632 --> 00:35:35,469
about three dozen corsages
for this prom.

777
00:35:35,511 --> 00:35:37,721
You know, the one
they put on their wrist.

778
00:35:37,763 --> 00:35:40,432
And everybody, they come.
"Where is it?"

779
00:35:40,474 --> 00:35:42,976
"When is it?"
"Does it match my dress?"

780
00:35:43,028 --> 00:35:44,770
It's a nightmare.

781
00:35:44,812 --> 00:35:48,357
Anyway, I guess there
was this leak next door...

782
00:35:48,399 --> 00:35:50,275

783
00:35:50,317 --> 00:35:51,777

Oui, monsieur!

00:42:31,218 --> 00:42:32,469
They speak
my language!

Ooh, I like her.

Hmm! 'Bout time
someone hit him.

I'm just sorry
it wasn't me.

[Atlanteans speaking
various languages]

How do they know
all these languages?

892
00:42:46,942 --> 00:42:49,445
Their language must be
based on a root dialect.

893
00:42:49,486 --> 00:42:50,852
It's just like
the Tower of Babel.

894
00:42:50,904 --> 00:42:53,615
Well, maybe English
is in there somewhere.

895
00:42:53,657 --> 00:42:56,577
We are explorers
from the surface world.

really amazing is that...

908
00:43:29,651 --> 00:43:30,944
if you deconstructed
Latin, you overlaid it...

909
00:43:30,996 --> 00:43:31,893
with a little Sumerian...

throw in a dash
of Thessalonian...

911
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:35,449
you'd be getting close to their
basic grammatical structure.

912
00:43:35,501 --> 00:43:36,898
Or at least you'd be
in the same ballpark...

913
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:41,163
- Someone's having a good time.
- Like a kid at Christmas.

914
00:43:41,205 --> 00:43:44,625
Commander, there were not
supposed to be people down here.

Ahem. Uh, excuse me?
Commander?

922
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:57,573
You presume much...

923
00:44:57,614 --> 00:44:59,491
to think you are
welcome here.

924
00:44:59,533 --> 00:45:02,494
Oh, sir, we have come
a long way looking for...

925
00:45:02,536 --> 00:45:04,621
I know what you seek...

926
00:45:04,663 --> 00:45:06,999
and you will not
find it here.

927

Your journey has been in vain.

But we are peaceful explorers,
men of science.

929
00:45:12,713 --> 00:45:16,675
Heh heh heh.
And yet you bring weapons.

930
00:45:16,717 --> 00:45:21,346
Our weapons allow us to remove
obstacles we may encounter.

931
00:45:21,388 --> 00:45:26,351
Some obstacles cannot be removed
with a mere show of force.

May I respectfully request
that we stay one night, sir?

938
00:45:43,952 --> 00:45:46,747

time to rest, resupply...

939

and be ready to travel
by morning.

you would have
slain them on sight.

946
00:46:10,354 --> 00:46:12,554
A thousand years ago,
the streets were lit...

947
00:46:12,606 --> 00:46:15,567
and our people did not
have to scavenge for food...

of a crumbling city!

know any better!

We were once a great people.
Now we live in ruins.

952

The kings of our past
would weep...

how far we have fallen.

- Lf these outsiders...

can unlock the secrets
of our past...

956
00:46:33,252 --> 00:46:35,462
perhaps we can
save our future.

00:46:35,504 --> 00:46:38,090
What they have to teach us...

958
00:46:38,132 --> 00:46:40,551
we have already learned.

959
00:46:40,603 --> 00:46:42,918
Our way of life is dying.

960
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:45,681
Our way of life
is preserved.

Mmm. Kida, when you
take the throne...

962
00:46:49,852 --> 00:46:51,603
you will understand.

963
00:46:54,898 --> 00:46:55,858
So, how'd it go?

964
00:46:55,899 --> 00:46:58,944
Well, the King and his daughter
don't exactly see eye to eye.

965
00:46:58,986 --> 00:47:01,321
She seems to like us OK,
but the King...

966
00:47:01,363 --> 00:47:02,698
I don't know, I think
he's hiding somethin'.

967
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:06,410
Well, if he's hiding something,
I want to know what it is.

968
00:47:06,452 --> 00:47:08,203
Someone needs to
talk to that girl.

969
00:47:08,245 --> 00:47:09,204
I will go!

970

Someone with good people skills.

971
00:47:10,831 --> 00:47:11,832
I will do it!

972
00:47:11,874 --> 00:47:13,042
Someone who won't
scare her away.

973
00:47:13,083 --> 00:47:14,043
I volunteer!

974
00:47:14,084 --> 00:47:16,086
Someone who can
speak the language.

975
00:47:16,128 --> 00:47:18,568
For the good
of the mission, I will go!

00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:21,008

no for an answer.

some questions for you...

Yeah, that's it.

983
00:47:45,032 --> 00:47:46,992
I have some
questions for you...

984
00:47:47,034 --> 00:47:48,494
and you are not
leaving this city...

985
00:47:48,535 --> 00:47:49,870
until they are answered.

986
00:47:49,912 --> 00:47:51,622
Yeah, well, l... OK.

987
00:47:51,663 --> 00:47:53,165
Shh!
Come with me.

988
00:48:00,422 --> 00:48:03,842
Oh, there is so much
to ask about your world.

989
00:48:03,884 --> 00:48:06,595
You are a scholar, are you not?

990
00:48:06,637 --> 00:48:08,180
Judging from your
diminished physique...

991
00:48:08,222 --> 00:48:09,348
and large forehead...

992
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:10,849
you are suited for nothing else.

993
00:48:10,891 --> 00:48:12,559
What is your
country of origin?

994
00:48:12,601 --> 00:48:14,186
When did the flood
waters recede?

995
00:48:14,228 --> 00:48:15,354
- How did you...
- Wait a minute.

996
00:48:15,396 --> 00:48:16,438
I got a few questions
for you, too.

997
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,731
So let's do this, OK?

998
00:48:17,773 --> 00:48:18,816
You ask one,
then I'll ask one...

999
00:48:18,857 --> 00:48:19,858
then you, then me, then...

1000
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,485
Well, you get it.

1001
00:48:21,527 --> 00:48:24,530
Very well.
What is your first question?

1002
00:48:24,571 --> 00:48:26,782
Well, OK, uh,
how did you get here?

1003
00:48:26,824 --> 00:48:28,242
Well, I mean,
not you personally...

1004
00:48:28,294 --> 00:48:29,660
but your... your culture.

1005
00:48:29,702 --> 00:48:32,162
I mean, how did all of this
end up down here?

1006
00:48:32,204 --> 00:48:35,249
It is said that the gods became
jealous of Atlantis.

1007
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:38,252
They sent a great cataclysm
and banished us here.

1008
00:48:38,293 --> 00:48:41,255
All I can remember
is the sky going dark...

1009
00:48:41,307 --> 00:48:44,717
and people shouting
and running.

1010
00:48:44,758 --> 00:48:48,178
Then, a bright light,
like a star...

1011
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:50,097
floating above the city.

1012
00:48:50,139 --> 00:48:53,225
My father said it called
my mother to it.

1013
00:48:53,892 --> 00:48:55,436
I never saw her again.

1014
00:48:55,477 --> 00:48:57,708
I'm sorry. If it...
if it's any consolation...

1015
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,940
I-I know how you feel,
because I lost my...

Wait a minute. Wait a minute!
Whoa, back up!

Wh... what... what are
you telling me...

1018
00:49:04,445 --> 00:49:06,071
that you remember
because you were there?

1019
00:49:06,113 --> 00:49:07,562
No, that... that's impossible...

1020
00:49:07,614 --> 00:49:09,241
because, I mean,
that would make you...

1021
00:49:09,283 --> 00:49:13,412
you know,
8,500-8,800 years old.

1022
00:49:13,454 --> 00:49:14,455
Yes.

1023
00:49:15,539 --> 00:49:18,876
Oh, well, hey, uh, pfft!
Lookin' good.

1024
00:49:18,917 --> 00:49:21,128
Just, uh, ahem...

1025
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:22,588
You got another question for me?

1026
00:49:22,629 --> 00:49:25,924
Yes. How is it you found
your way to this place?

1027
00:49:25,966 --> 00:49:27,760
Well, I'll tell you,
it wasn't easy.

1028
00:49:27,801 --> 00:49:30,262
If it weren't for this book,
we never would have made it.

1029
00:49:30,304 --> 00:49:32,222
OK, second question.

1030
00:49:32,264 --> 00:49:33,807
Legend has it
that your people possessed...

1031
00:49:33,849 --> 00:49:35,517
a power source of some kind
that enabled them...

1032
00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:37,311
You mean you can
understand this?

1033
00:49:37,353 --> 00:49:38,729
Yes, I'm a linguist.

1034
00:49:38,771 --> 00:49:40,189
That's what I do,
that's my job.

1035

Now, getting back
to my question...

1036
00:49:41,398 --> 00:49:43,765
This, right here,
you can read this?

1037
00:49:43,817 --> 00:49:46,362
Yes, yes, I can read Atlantean,
just like you.

You can't, can you?

1039

No one can.

1040
00:49:51,825 --> 00:49:53,285
Such knowledge
has been lost to us...

1041

of the Mehbelmok.

Oh, the Great Flood.

1043
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:58,040
Show me.

1044
00:49:58,082 --> 00:49:59,124

Yes. But no matter
what I try...

1055

01:09:35,342 --> 01:09:37,970
SWEET: Milo,
you better get up here.

1398
01:09:41,223 --> 01:09:42,558
MILO:
How's he doing?

1399
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:44,643
Not good, I'm afraid.

1400
01:09:44,685 --> 01:09:46,270
Internal bleeding.

1401
01:09:46,311 --> 01:09:48,063
There's nothing more
I can do.

1402
01:09:48,105 --> 01:09:49,565
MILO: What a nightmare.

1403
01:09:49,606 --> 01:09:51,431
And I brought it here.

1404
01:09:51,483 --> 01:09:52,860
Ah, don't go
beating yourself up.

1405
01:09:52,901 --> 01:09:55,029
He's been after that
crystal since Iceland.

1406
01:09:56,405 --> 01:09:57,614
The crystal.

1407
01:09:57,656 --> 01:09:59,158
Sweet, that's it.

1408
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:00,659
These... these crystals...

1409
01:10:00,701 --> 01:10:02,411
they have some sort
of healing energy.

1410
01:10:02,453 --> 01:10:04,329
I've... I've seen it work.

1411
01:10:04,371 --> 01:10:05,539
KING: No.

1412
01:10:05,581 --> 01:10:07,583
Where is my daughter?

1413
01:10:07,624 --> 01:10:09,668
Well, she... she...

1414
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:11,003
Mmm.

1415
01:10:11,045 --> 01:10:12,504
She has been chosen...

1416
01:10:12,546 --> 01:10:14,506
like her mother before her.

1417
01:10:14,558 --> 01:10:15,758
What?

1418
01:10:15,799 --> 01:10:17,176
KING:
In times of danger...

1419
01:10:17,217 --> 01:10:19,261
the crystal
will choose a host...

1420
01:10:19,303 --> 01:10:20,846
one of royal blood...

1421
01:10:20,888 --> 01:10:22,473
to protect itself...

1422
01:10:22,514 --> 01:10:24,224
and its people.

1423
01:10:24,266 --> 01:10:25,768
It will accept no other.

1424
01:10:25,809 --> 01:10:28,187
W-Wait a minute.
Choose?

1425
01:10:28,228 --> 01:10:30,272
So this thing is alive?

1426
01:10:30,314 --> 01:10:32,024
In a way.

1427
01:10:32,066 --> 01:10:34,109
The crystal thrives...

1428
01:10:34,151 --> 01:10:35,736
on the collective emotions...

1429
01:10:35,778 --> 01:10:38,530
of all who came before us.

1430
01:10:38,572 --> 01:10:42,117
In return,
it provides power...

1431
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:45,537
longevity, protection.

1432
01:10:45,579 --> 01:10:46,747
As it grew...

1433
01:10:46,789 --> 01:10:49,875
it developed
a consciousness of its own.

1434
01:10:49,917 --> 01:10:51,710
[Coughs]

1435
01:10:52,378 --> 01:10:54,505
In my arrogance...

1436
01:10:54,546 --> 01:10:57,091
I sought to use it
as a weapon of war...

1437
01:10:57,132 --> 01:11:01,637
but it's power proved
too great to control.

1438
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:03,931
It overwhelmed us...

1439
01:11:03,972 --> 01:11:07,017
and led to our destruction.

1440
01:11:07,059 --> 01:11:08,936
That's why you hid it
beneath the city...

1441
01:11:08,977 --> 01:11:11,230
to keep history
from repeating itself.

1442
01:11:11,271 --> 01:11:14,566
KING: And to prevent Kida
from suffering the same fate...

1443
01:11:14,608 --> 01:11:16,902
as my beloved wife.

1444
01:11:16,944 --> 01:11:18,237
What do you mean?
Wh...

1445
01:11:18,278 --> 01:11:19,905
What's going to happen
to Kida?

1446
01:11:19,947 --> 01:11:23,242
If she remains bonded
to the crystal...

1447
01:11:23,283 --> 01:11:27,955
she could be lost to it forever.

1448
01:11:27,996 --> 01:11:32,543
The love of my daughter
is all I have left.

1449
01:11:32,584 --> 01:11:34,962
My burden
would have become hers...

1450
01:11:35,003 --> 01:11:36,380
when the time was right...

1451
01:11:36,422 --> 01:11:38,173
but now...

1452
01:11:38,215 --> 01:11:39,883
it falls to you.

1453
01:11:39,925 --> 01:11:42,261
Me?

1454
01:11:42,302 --> 01:11:44,054
Return the crystal.

1456
01:11:45,431 --> 01:11:48,079
Save Atlantis.

1457
01:11:48,131 --> 01:11:50,728
Save my daughter.

Hmm.

1462
01:12:11,081 --> 01:12:13,208
So, what's it going to be?

1463
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:15,878
Excuse me?

1464
01:12:15,919 --> 01:12:18,297
I followed you in,
and I'll follow you out.

1465
01:12:18,338 --> 01:12:19,840
It's your decision.

1466
01:12:19,882 --> 01:12:21,258
Oh, my decision?

1467
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:22,301
Well, I think we've seen
how effective...

1468
01:12:22,343 --> 01:12:23,761
my decisions have been.

1469
01:12:23,802 --> 01:12:25,095
Let's recap.

1470
01:12:25,137 --> 01:12:27,306
I lead a band
of plundering vandals...

1471
01:12:27,348 --> 01:12:28,682
to the greatest
archeological find...

1472
01:12:28,724 --> 01:12:30,017
in recorded history...

1473
01:12:30,059 --> 01:12:32,311
thus enabling
the kidnap and/or murder...

1474
01:12:32,353 --> 01:12:33,562
of the royal family...

1475
01:12:33,604 --> 01:12:35,022
not to mention
personally delivering...

1476
01:12:35,064 --> 01:12:36,774
the most powerful force
known to man...

1477
01:12:36,815 --> 01:12:38,598
into the hands
of a mercenary nutcase...

1478
01:12:38,650 --> 01:12:40,527
who's probably going
to sell it to the Kaiser!

1479
01:12:40,569 --> 01:12:42,738
Have I left
anything out?

1480
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:44,281
Well, you did
set the camp on fire...

1481
01:12:44,323 --> 01:12:45,449
and drop us
down that big hole.

1482
01:12:45,491 --> 01:12:46,658
Thank you.

1483
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:48,786
Thank you very much.

1484
01:12:52,373 --> 01:12:53,999
Of course,
it's been my experience...

1485
01:12:54,041 --> 01:12:55,125
when you hit bottom...

1486
01:12:55,167 --> 01:12:57,336
the only place
left to go is up.

1487
01:12:57,378 --> 01:12:59,296
[Sighs]
Who told you that?

1488
01:12:59,338 --> 01:13:02,341
A fella by the name
of Thaddeus Thatch.

1489
01:13:10,849 --> 01:13:12,226
Where are you going?

1490
01:13:12,267 --> 01:13:13,811
I'm going after Rourke.

1491
01:13:13,852 --> 01:13:15,312
Milo, that's crazy.

1492
01:13:15,396 --> 01:13:17,189
I didn't say
it was the smart thing...

1493
01:13:17,231 --> 01:13:19,149
but it is the right thing.

1495

he doesn't hurt himself.

you are doing?

1497
01:13:29,118 --> 01:13:30,327
Just follow my lead.

Hey, Milo,
you got something sporty?

1508
01:13:49,596 --> 01:13:51,181
You know, like a tuna?

1509
01:13:51,223 --> 01:13:52,474
How is this done?

1510
01:13:52,516 --> 01:13:54,601
All you got to do
is use the crystals.

1511
01:13:54,643 --> 01:13:55,936
Kida showed me.

1512
01:13:58,313 --> 01:14:00,024

01:32:21,177 --> 01:32:22,835
Whoa, whoa

1756
01:32:22,876 --> 01:32:25,619
Oh

1757
01:32:25,671 --> 01:32:27,276
All right

1758
01:32:27,328 --> 01:32:28,882
All right

1759
01:32:30,342 --> 01:32:33,971
When you finally
find that place

1760
01:32:34,013 --> 01:32:38,559
You'll find all you need

1761
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:42,813
Where the dream leads you

1762
01:32:42,855 --> 01:32:44,857
Your dream
will lead you on

1763
01:32:44,898 --> 01:32:49,987
Only your heart
can see

1764
01:32:50,029 --> 01:32:52,448
Oh, yeah

1765
01:32:52,489 --> 01:32:56,493
There's a world
that waits for you

1766
01:32:56,535 --> 01:32:59,246
You're not alone

1767
01:32:59,288 --> 01:33:02,207
You'll find your home

1768
01:33:02,249 --> 01:33:03,751
Where the dream takes you

1769
01:33:03,792 --> 01:33:07,588
Try to change your mind

1770
01:33:07,629 --> 01:33:10,507
Where the dream takes you

1771
01:33:10,559 --> 01:33:13,385
Try to change your heart

1772
01:33:13,427 --> 01:33:15,262
Where the dream takes you

1773
01:33:15,304 --> 01:33:20,267
But you must go

1774
01:33:20,309 --> 01:33:21,685
Where the dream
takes you

1775
01:33:33,530 --> 01:33:35,324
[Chorus singing]
