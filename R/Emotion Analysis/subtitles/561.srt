1
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,753
I had a vision in Amityville.

2
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:53,509
I had a premonition of your death.

3
00:00:55,978 --> 00:00:58,946
We have both seen the same inhuman spirit.

4
00:00:58,948 --> 00:01:01,757
Mom, who is that?

5
00:01:12,294 --> 00:01:16,468
The demon in your painting is real.

6
00:01:16,996 --> 00:01:21,082
The following occurred in 1952

7
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:28,953
Abbey of St Carta, Romania.

8
00:02:01,406 --> 00:02:05,901
GOD ENDS HERE

9
00:02:06,344 --> 00:02:09,006
Are you certain we're
making the right decision?

10
00:02:10,681 --> 00:02:12,911
We have no other choice.

11
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:32,822
Will the relic truly save us?

12
00:02:36,005 --> 00:02:37,796
Have faith, sister.

13
00:02:53,856 --> 00:02:56,280
Our father, who art in heaven,

14
00:02:56,304 --> 00:02:58,522
hallowed be thy name,

15
00:02:58,794 --> 00:03:02,034
Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done

16
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:04,287
on earth as it is in heaven...

17
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:07,092
Give us this day our daily bread...

18
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:09,984
And forgive us our trespasses,

19
00:03:10,008 --> 00:03:12,271
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

20
00:03:24,353 --> 00:03:25,353
Take it!

21
00:03:25,354 --> 00:03:28,222
This evil needs a vessel to escape.

22
00:03:28,788 --> 00:03:32,000
It will come after you next.
Don't let it have you.

23
00:03:32,024 --> 00:03:35,062
- You know what you must do.
- I can't.

24
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,088
Then, not even God...

25
00:04:46,794 --> 00:04:50,410
Forgive me, father, for the sin
that I'm about to commit.

26
00:05:23,427 --> 00:05:24,857
Forgive me, Lord.

27
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:45,917
Oh God!

28
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:58,588
VATICAN CITY

29
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,340
Father Burke?

30
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:04,664
Bishop.

31
00:07:05,724 --> 00:07:10,502
So, last time you were here was what night?
Six.. seven years ago?

32
00:07:11,462 --> 00:07:14,406
After my time as a chaplain
ended in the war, Yes.

33
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:18,080
We appreciate you coming again,
under such short notice.

34
00:07:20,705 --> 00:07:22,249
Father Burke.

35
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,070
Sit.

36
00:07:29,012 --> 00:07:32,435
We have received news that a
nun has taken her own life...

37
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:35,306
at an Abbey in the mountains of Romania.

38
00:07:35,452 --> 00:07:38,886
Suicide is a terrible, a terrible sin.

39
00:07:40,122 --> 00:07:43,556
But it doesn't strike me as a strong
enough reason for our reunion.

40
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,760
But the news of it would
not boast our arguments

41
00:07:46,784 --> 00:07:49,463
to keep with the
faith and the church...

42
00:07:49,465 --> 00:07:51,077
You are not telling me something.

43
00:07:51,101 --> 00:07:55,288
- Why do you say that?
- Because we are in the Vatican.

44
00:07:55,437 --> 00:07:57,424
Let me put it this way, father.

45
00:07:57,606 --> 00:08:01,520
In this, orbeat rare instance...

46
00:08:01,544 --> 00:08:05,173
We do not believe we are
the ones with the secret.

47
00:08:06,947 --> 00:08:08,859
Those are your travel documents...

48
00:08:08,883 --> 00:08:13,263
and contact information on the
man who discovered the nun.

49
00:08:13,287 --> 00:08:16,266
He lives near the Abbey in a
small village called Biertan.

50
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,314
You will want to talk to him first.

51
00:08:18,392 --> 00:08:21,038
Also in the file is the
name of a postulant...

52
00:08:21,062 --> 00:08:23,849
who can help assist you in your inquiries.

53
00:08:24,032 --> 00:08:29,147
Since it is a cloister at convent
and your access will be limited.

54
00:08:30,237 --> 00:08:34,758
She is also familiar
with the territory.

55
00:08:39,864 --> 00:08:43,519
VINCENT HOSPITAL,
London, England.

56
00:08:43,543 --> 00:08:47,040
I have survived many
terrifying encounters,

57
00:08:47,255 --> 00:08:50,842
but nothing could have
ever prepared me for this.

58
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:55,731
My only hope now is that the
beast could not smell me.

59
00:08:56,127 --> 00:09:00,339
But then, the wind changed and...

60
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:07,001
Run!
Run for your lives!

61
00:09:07,738 --> 00:09:11,184
Mother superior says that
dinosaurs were never really alive.

62
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,830
God just put their bones
here, to test our faith.

63
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:17,017
That seems like a pretty
dirty trick, don't you think?

64
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,192
Wait, they are not in the Bible.

65
00:09:19,216 --> 00:09:22,328
Well... do you believe in
penguins and koala bears?

66
00:09:22,352 --> 00:09:24,863
- Yes.
- They aren't in the Bible either.

67
00:09:25,888 --> 00:09:28,972
The Bible is God's love letter to us...

68
00:09:28,996 --> 00:09:32,016
but, it doesn't mean that he doesn't
want us to ask questions...

69
00:09:32,094 --> 00:09:34,238
about the wonders of his creation.

70
00:09:34,262 --> 00:09:36,174
But Mother Superior says...

71
00:09:36,198 --> 00:09:38,723
Wait a minute, you've got a little
something on your nose.

72
00:09:38,902 --> 00:09:40,233
There.

73
00:09:49,077 --> 00:09:52,490
- The Vatican?
- I'm as surprised as you.

74
00:09:53,047 --> 00:09:56,459
- I haven't yet taken my vows yet.
- Oh! He's aware of that.

75
00:09:56,483 --> 00:09:58,915
He is waiting for you in the garden.

76
00:10:00,254 --> 00:10:04,840
And change in to your habit.
This is an official visit.

77
00:10:08,129 --> 00:10:10,893
It shouldn't take more
than few days at most.

78
00:10:10,898 --> 00:10:13,255
You were recommended for
the journey because

79
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,572
of your familiarity
with the territory.

80
00:10:15,635 --> 00:10:16,835
The territory?

81
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:19,599
Yes. Romania.

82
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,787
I've never been in that part of the world.

83
00:10:24,811 --> 00:10:27,589
- Really?
- There must have been some mistake.

84
00:10:27,613 --> 00:10:30,733
I apologize if you coming here
was a waste of your time.

85
00:10:30,749 --> 00:10:33,087
No apologies are necessary.

86
00:10:33,319 --> 00:10:36,945
Every decision that Vatican
makes, is with purpose.

87
00:10:37,757 --> 00:10:40,441
I'm sure they had their
reasons for selecting you.

88
00:11:06,122 --> 00:11:09,712
BIERTAN, ROMANIA.

89
00:11:14,923 --> 00:11:16,255
What is it?

90
00:11:16,893 --> 00:11:18,726
Mr Theriault?

91
00:11:21,162 --> 00:11:22,362
Hi.

92
00:11:23,699 --> 00:11:25,851
Jealous husband or angry father?

93
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,468
I'm sorry, what?

94
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,765
Usually it's one of the two...

95
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,208
when an older man and

96
00:11:32,232 --> 00:11:34,806
a young, beautiful...

97
00:11:34,842 --> 00:11:38,600
not so innocent girl, show up in the
doors at this hour of the morning.

98
00:11:38,647 --> 00:11:42,646
I beg your pardon, Mr. Theriault,
but you and I have never met.

99
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,302
Then perhaps time we do.

100
00:11:47,321 --> 00:11:49,107
Call Me Frenchy,

101
00:11:49,131 --> 00:11:50,835
everyone does.

102
00:11:50,859 --> 00:11:54,994
Mr. Theriault, we are here because
of the nun you found at the abbey.

103
00:11:57,397 --> 00:11:59,087
How do you ...?

104
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,398
Oh you priest?

105
00:12:02,536 --> 00:12:04,442
And she's a nun.

106
00:12:08,273 --> 00:12:10,453
Forgive me for my impure thoughts, Sister.

107
00:12:11,009 --> 00:12:15,589
I had no idea. Never seen
a nun out of a vestments.

108
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:17,640
Not that I am opposed to.

109
00:12:18,317 --> 00:12:19,517
Excuse me.

110
00:12:19,953 --> 00:12:21,804
Mr. Theriault...

111
00:12:23,022 --> 00:12:25,646
The Abbey, is it far?

112
00:12:26,123 --> 00:12:30,041
Not of distance, no. But
takes time to get to.

113
00:12:30,727 --> 00:12:33,621
If I may ask, why were you there?

114
00:12:33,831 --> 00:12:36,241
I was delivering the quarterly supplies.

115
00:12:36,265 --> 00:12:39,281
Apparently, the Abbey
has had some kind of

116
00:12:39,305 --> 00:12:42,589
arrangement with the
village for centuries.

117
00:12:42,773 --> 00:12:45,943
Do you think you could take
us there sometime soon?

118
00:12:46,977 --> 00:12:48,691
Don't think so, Father.

119
00:12:49,445 --> 00:12:51,391
Is there someone else in the village then?

120
00:12:51,415 --> 00:12:54,844
Everyone in this village pretend
like the Abbey does not exists.

121
00:12:55,118 --> 00:12:57,695
Even talking about it
might get you in trouble.

122
00:12:58,954 --> 00:13:00,338
It's settled then.

123
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,944
You will take us.

124
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:07,851
- With all due respect, Father...
- Please, Frenchy.

125
00:13:09,938 --> 00:13:12,137
<i>Hey, go home.</i>

126
00:13:16,506 --> 00:13:19,765
You took a plane from Rome,
a bus from Bucharest...

127
00:13:20,207 --> 00:13:23,228
And now, my friends, you
are in the dark ages.

128
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,500
In the backwoods of Romania.

129
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,818
Now you travel by horse.

130
00:13:35,842 --> 00:13:38,138
Where are your things?

131
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:17,915
The postman's charge, 10 letters with an L.

132
00:14:20,664 --> 00:14:22,137
Deliveries.

133
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,257
Yeah, but not for this, Sister.

134
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:31,060
What brings a Frenchmen to
the countryside of Romania?

135
00:14:31,084 --> 00:14:34,287
Actually I'm French Canadian,
but don't tell anyone.

136
00:14:34,311 --> 00:14:36,316
Doesn't sound as romantic.

137
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:40,125
I came here looking for gold, but
when I met the people here...

138
00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:45,393
I just knew this was the place I was meant
to be. Wanted to help them. Anyway I could.

139
00:14:45,854 --> 00:14:47,519
That's very noble of you.

140
00:14:48,056 --> 00:14:49,467
I know.

141
00:14:50,758 --> 00:14:54,036
Tell me sister... How
long have you been a nun?

142
00:14:56,164 --> 00:14:59,065
I'm not a nun yet,
I'm still just a novice.

143
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:01,657
You still haven't taken
your temporary vows?

144
00:15:01,858 --> 00:15:03,143
Temporary?

145
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:06,450
I didn't think there was anything
temporary about being a nun.

146
00:15:06,474 --> 00:15:09,953
Temporary vows would help prepare me
for a life of total consecration.

147
00:15:09,977 --> 00:15:13,310
Would sister, or will?

148
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:18,206
What happened?

149
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,472
Everything alright?

150
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,264
We walk the rest of the way.

151
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:26,741
The horse won't go any further.

152
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:31,573
Maybe you should get a new horse.

153
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:35,272
It's not the horse, Father,
it's what lies ahead.

154
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,678
He is scared.

155
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:40,487
Locals say it's a cursed place.
And the horse agrees.

156
00:15:47,412 --> 00:15:51,486
If I may ask, Father, why is it the
church sends you on such tasks?

157
00:15:51,615 --> 00:15:55,937
The Church reaches out to me when they need
some investigation into unusual phenomenon.

158
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,494
Associated with Catholicism.

159
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:01,872
Unofficially they call
it "miracle hunting."

160
00:16:01,896 --> 00:16:03,903
I thought we were here
because of a suicide.

161
00:16:03,927 --> 00:16:07,103
We are, but it's only part
of our investigation.

162
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:12,364
I also have orders from the Vatican to
determine if the grounds are still...

163
00:16:13,234 --> 00:16:14,327
Holy.

164
00:16:14,351 --> 00:16:17,410
But I can give you my opinion
on that now, Father.

165
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:29,957
Result of the war?

166
00:16:31,152 --> 00:16:32,830
Bombing raids, yes.

167
00:16:32,854 --> 00:16:36,131
I heard stories of how the ground
shook for days after them.

168
00:16:36,257 --> 00:16:38,692
I've tried to find more information
on the castle itself...

169
00:16:38,693 --> 00:16:41,138
But there is no record
of it in the village.

170
00:16:41,162 --> 00:16:43,731
And the locals only spit
when it's mentioned.

171
00:16:43,898 --> 00:16:47,805
- Spit?
- Yeah, to ward off evil.

172
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:51,097
It is an old and silly superstition.

173
00:16:51,105 --> 00:16:54,518
And if you asked me, these crosses
that surround the Abbey...

174
00:16:54,542 --> 00:16:57,057
They keep evil in, not out.

175
00:16:58,044 --> 00:17:00,824
You tried to contact someone
inside when you found the nun?

176
00:17:00,848 --> 00:17:03,066
I did, no one responded.

177
00:17:03,751 --> 00:17:07,209
Then again in the two years
I've been delivering supplies,

178
00:17:07,455 --> 00:17:09,413
She was the first nun I'd seen.

179
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,101
Frenchy, when you found
the nun, what did you do?

180
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:19,541
I moved it to protect the
body from the elements.

181
00:17:19,565 --> 00:17:22,562
- Where did you move it to, son?
- The ice house.

182
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:25,105
That's where I leave my deliveries.

183
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:29,450
When I found the Sister, I thought...

184
00:17:30,358 --> 00:17:34,644
might be, moving her in here
would help preserve her.

185
00:17:45,656 --> 00:17:47,216
<i>After You.</i>

186
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,906
I should tell you one more thing, Father.

187
00:18:15,918 --> 00:18:19,815
- What?
- That's not how I left her.

188
00:18:21,355 --> 00:18:22,555
What do you mean?

189
00:18:22,556 --> 00:18:27,720
She was laying down when I left her here.
Not like that sitting up.

190
00:18:45,412 --> 00:18:48,470
There have been cases
of bodies twitching...

191
00:18:49,382 --> 00:18:52,828
or sitting up, not long after death.

192
00:18:52,852 --> 00:18:55,931
Yeah, but Father, who knows how long
she was dead when I found her.

193
00:18:55,955 --> 00:18:58,579
- You are not helping.
- Sorry.

194
00:19:09,635 --> 00:19:13,238
- Father, what is it?
- Seems to be a key of some kind.

195
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,656
DELIVERIES

196
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,894
That's the door the nuns would
enter from to choose supplies.

197
00:19:25,651 --> 00:19:27,884
So they wouldn't have to leave the castle.

198
00:19:30,621 --> 00:19:32,669
We should give her a proper burial.

199
00:19:34,893 --> 00:19:38,247
<i>In the name of the Father and
of the Son, and Holy Spirit.</i>

200
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:39,499
<i>Amen.</i>

201
00:19:50,071 --> 00:19:52,166
It's common practice during the plague,

202
00:19:52,201 --> 00:19:54,285
when people feared to be buried alive.

203
00:19:54,309 --> 00:19:57,621
If you were unfortunate
enough for it to happen...

204
00:19:57,645 --> 00:20:00,640
You could ring the bell,
to let those above

205
00:20:00,664 --> 00:20:03,233
ground know, they
have made a mistake.

206
00:20:03,252 --> 00:20:05,693
I think being here is a mistake.

207
00:20:25,305 --> 00:20:26,742
That's where I found her.

208
00:21:08,111 --> 00:21:11,162
How is that possible? It's been weeks.

209
00:21:11,709 --> 00:21:14,629
I told you. This place is...

210
00:21:15,058 --> 00:21:17,693
What is the opposite
of a miracle, Father?

211
00:23:03,113 --> 00:23:04,399
Hello?

212
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:10,911
Please excuse us for unannounced arrival.

213
00:23:15,262 --> 00:23:16,965
Hello?

214
00:23:18,475 --> 00:23:20,972
What is it you want?

215
00:23:22,691 --> 00:23:27,398
I'm Father Anthony Burke.
This is Sister Irene.

216
00:23:28,409 --> 00:23:32,278
- Are you the Reverend Mother?
- I am.

217
00:23:33,957 --> 00:23:37,673
You haven’t taken your vows yet.

218
00:23:39,636 --> 00:23:40,989
No.

219
00:23:41,013 --> 00:23:44,160
Why are you here, Father?

220
00:23:44,184 --> 00:23:48,475
We come on behalf of Rome, to inquire
about the recent death in your convent.

221
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,424
Recent death?

222
00:23:51,448 --> 00:23:53,735
One of your nuns.

223
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:58,943
I found her outside,
hang from her neck.

224
00:23:59,589 --> 00:24:01,842
Is that so?

225
00:24:02,943 --> 00:24:08,134
And you saw fit to bury her?

226
00:24:10,645 --> 00:24:13,933
Would you allow us for a moment?
Please.

227
00:24:24,127 --> 00:24:26,415
You should leave with him.

228
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:31,616
Are you saying you weren't aware
of the risk passing of the nun?

229
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,831
Rome is concerned about safety
and well-being of your closer.

230
00:24:35,855 --> 00:24:39,937
I would like to speak with your sister, so
I can offer my assurances to the church.

231
00:24:40,615 --> 00:24:44,069
I can offer the assurance you seek.

232
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:46,658
I'm afraid that won't suffice.

233
00:24:47,792 --> 00:24:53,569
They will just send more, and perhaps
less diplomatic church officials.

234
00:24:53,593 --> 00:24:55,950
Yes, Father.

235
00:24:55,974 --> 00:25:02,084
However the gate will be closing shortly as
we are about to take out vespers..

236
00:25:02,108 --> 00:25:07,430
Followed by the Great Silence
which ends near to morning.

237
00:25:07,454 --> 00:25:13,536
Come back tomorrow and you will find
the answers you seek.

238
00:25:14,004 --> 00:25:19,713
There is lodging in the convent,
you may stay there.

239
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:28,269
Thank you.

240
00:25:37,714 --> 00:25:42,446
Why could you not talk to the sisters now?
Why must we wait til morning?

241
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:47,455
The sisters took the vow of silence from
sunset to sunrise. That must be respected.

242
00:25:47,478 --> 00:25:49,503
You should begin heading back yourself.

243
00:25:49,527 --> 00:25:53,604
You might didn't wanna be caught
on the relics when night falls.

244
00:25:54,827 --> 00:25:57,115
Better roads than here, Father.

245
00:25:58,378 --> 00:26:01,374
We'll be fine son.
Come back in a few days.

246
00:26:01,924 --> 00:26:05,005
That should give us enough
time to get what we need.

247
00:26:06,892 --> 00:26:08,928
Yes, Father.

248
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:52,980
Hello?

249
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:23,004
Hey... Hey!

250
00:28:58,451 --> 00:29:01,499
I'll take.....that.

251
00:29:07,323 --> 00:29:13,523
OK... alright.

252
00:29:41,108 --> 00:29:42,963
- Father?
- Hmm?

253
00:29:42,987 --> 00:29:45,342
You mentioned miracle hunting before.

254
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:46,941
Is that...

255
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,514
Is that a roll you sought up..

256
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:52,619
No. God, no.

257
00:29:53,381 --> 00:29:55,231
I'm part of a...

258
00:29:55,255 --> 00:29:58,253
small select field that church
relies on to...

259
00:29:59,723 --> 00:30:02,011
look in to their more...

260
00:30:03,061 --> 00:30:04,764
Unusual matters..

261
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:07,213
So you knew Bishop Forne?

262
00:30:07,236 --> 00:30:10,024
- How do you...
- Because he helped me when I was younger.

263
00:30:10,534 --> 00:30:13,070
I had a series of visions
when I was a girl.

264
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:16,560
My father believed
I was mentally unstable.

265
00:30:16,584 --> 00:30:18,871
Or worse, a liar.

266
00:30:19,509 --> 00:30:21,822
But word of my vision reached the church..

267
00:30:21,846 --> 00:30:25,327
Cardinal Conroy, specifically, and
he sent Bishop Forne to meet with me.

268
00:30:25,351 --> 00:30:27,762
What were your visions?

269
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:34,313
There were many, never
the same one repeated.

270
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:40,437
But, after each one ended.
The same thought would be stuck in my head.

271
00:30:40,461 --> 00:30:42,749
Which was....what?

272
00:30:44,552 --> 00:30:46,462
Mary points the way.

273
00:30:55,943 --> 00:30:58,237
What is it, Father?

274
00:30:59,409 --> 00:31:06,105
I was, thinking of a similar incident I
encountered in France. During the war..

275
00:31:06,797 --> 00:31:10,042
I was stationed there, near Lyon.

276
00:31:10,805 --> 00:31:14,080
I was told to investigate
a boy with visions.

277
00:31:16,686 --> 00:31:19,475
But unlike your case...

278
00:31:20,068 --> 00:31:23,225
after what I believe
with careful evaluation...

279
00:31:25,911 --> 00:31:28,113
I made the judgment he was possessed...

280
00:31:28,414 --> 00:31:31,748
I'm persuaded to act accordingly
within the laws of the church.

281
00:31:33,716 --> 00:31:36,712
My God. Daniel...

282
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:43,432
What have they done to you?

283
00:31:53,249 --> 00:31:55,078
Was it a success?

284
00:31:55,673 --> 00:31:57,664
The church thought so.

285
00:31:58,718 --> 00:32:01,462
They believed the evil was cast out.

286
00:32:02,893 --> 00:32:04,804
But not you.

287
00:32:06,816 --> 00:32:11,147
The most glorious Prince,
of the Heavenly Armies...

288
00:32:11,988 --> 00:32:14,693
Saint Michael, the archangel...

289
00:32:21,424 --> 00:32:22,791
Help me, Father.

290
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:28,553
Come to the assistance of Daniel.
The God and may in, his likeness.

291
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:32,211
- Behold the cross of Lord.
- Why don't you help me?

292
00:32:32,235 --> 00:32:34,508
Begone, you evil forces.

293
00:32:40,957 --> 00:32:44,412
Daniel sustained severe injuries
during the exorcism.

294
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,317
Ones from which he couldn't recover.

295
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:49,713
Daniel, I'm so sorry.

296
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:00,815
He died, days later.

297
00:33:05,123 --> 00:33:10,352
I often wonder, if I was too eager
with my determination.

298
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,712
That is a puzzle.

299
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,493
Father.

300
00:36:21,605 --> 00:36:23,392
Father.

301
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,224
Daniel?

302
00:36:51,825 --> 00:36:54,321
Wait. No.

303
00:36:55,292 --> 00:36:57,075
Help.

304
00:36:57,668 --> 00:36:59,957
No.

305
00:38:15,341 --> 00:38:17,544
Help.

306
00:38:18,503 --> 00:38:20,314
Somebody.

307
00:40:11,404 --> 00:40:12,714
Help.

308
00:40:12,738 --> 00:40:14,609
Sister Irene. Help.

309
00:40:17,038 --> 00:40:20,286
Father?

310
00:40:23,048 --> 00:40:25,335
Father?

311
00:40:36,406 --> 00:40:38,234
Father?

312
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:16,722
Help.

313
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,473
Help me.

314
00:41:34,798 --> 00:41:36,941
- Father?
- Sister?

315
00:41:36,965 --> 00:41:39,699
- Sister Irene.
- Father, I can hear you.

316
00:41:39,723 --> 00:41:41,842
Over here.

317
00:41:43,229 --> 00:41:46,017
Thank God. Thank you.

318
00:42:49,134 --> 00:42:51,418
Hurry!!

319
00:43:14,423 --> 00:43:16,712
Thank you, Thank you sister.

320
00:43:24,564 --> 00:43:27,754
How did you get in there?
The ground was covered.

321
00:43:27,778 --> 00:43:31,111
There's some powerful evil
presence in this place.

322
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:42,511
Maybe those books will help
shine a light on our answer.

323
00:43:46,021 --> 00:43:49,652
There's more of it,
how's that possible?

324
00:43:49,676 --> 00:43:51,170
Another puzzle.

325
00:44:06,388 --> 00:44:08,090
Abbess?

326
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:14,850
As requested,
we're here to speak with the nuns.

327
00:44:22,293 --> 00:44:29,533
It seems like not so much as an invitation
as we get. - I'll go find the Abbess.

328
00:44:29,843 --> 00:44:31,754
Take this.

329
00:44:33,473 --> 00:44:35,514
See what that you can find out about it.

330
00:44:35,729 --> 00:44:38,582
It was obviously important to the desist.

331
00:44:39,192 --> 00:44:41,980
Sister, be careful please.

332
00:44:42,657 --> 00:44:44,528
I will, Father.

333
00:45:06,574 --> 00:45:08,649
Hello?

334
00:45:08,786 --> 00:45:10,405
Wait.

335
00:45:40,203 --> 00:45:41,861
<i>Plena, Dominus tecum.</i>

336
00:45:41,862 --> 00:45:47,428
<i>Benedicta Tu in mulieribus, et benedictus
fructus ventris tui nobis peccatoribus...</i>

337
00:45:47,452 --> 00:45:50,076
<i>nunc, et in hora mortis nostrae. Amen.</i>

338
00:45:50,918 --> 00:45:54,375
<i>Ave Maria, gratia plena, Dominus tecum.</i>

339
00:45:54,508 --> 00:45:58,170
<i>Benedicta Tu in mulieribus,
et Benedict fructus ventris tui, lesus.</i>

340
00:46:00,226 --> 00:46:05,642
<i>Maria, Mater Dei, Ora pro nobis
peccatoribus, nunc, et in hor...</i>

341
00:46:06,027 --> 00:46:08,732
<i>Ave Maria, gratia plena...</i>

342
00:46:10,366 --> 00:46:13,470
<i>- benetus fructus ventris tui, lesus.
- Sister?</i>

343
00:46:13,494 --> 00:46:16,743
<i>Ave Maria, gratia plena, Dominus tecum.</i>

344
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,648
<i>Benedicta Tu in mulieribus...</i>

345
00:46:19,672 --> 00:46:21,442
<i>ventris tui, lesus.</i>

346
00:46:21,466 --> 00:46:26,159
<i>Sancta Maria, Mater Dei,
Ora pro nobis peccatoribus...</i>

347
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:28,949
<i>nunc, et in hora mortis nostrae. Amen.</i>

348
00:46:29,397 --> 00:46:34,257
<i>Ave Maria, gratia plena, Dominus tecum.</i>

349
00:46:34,281 --> 00:46:36,532
<i>Benedicta Tu in mulieribus...</i>

350
00:46:36,549 --> 00:46:38,672
Sister.

351
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:41,921
We mustn't stop praying,
even for a second. This

352
00:46:41,945 --> 00:46:45,236
convent has had perpetual
etheration for centuries.

353
00:46:45,237 --> 00:46:47,871
This sisters prayers seems to maintain
the constant rituals.

354
00:46:47,895 --> 00:46:49,721
I'm so sorry to have disturbed her.

355
00:46:49,845 --> 00:46:54,230
Sister Ruth has listed more than just
someone sneaking up behind her.

356
00:46:54,254 --> 00:46:57,318
I'm Sister Oana.
We were told you were coming.

357
00:46:57,342 --> 00:46:59,829
Please, follow me.

358
00:47:01,072 --> 00:47:05,570
Benedicta Tu in mulieribus,
et Benedict fructus ventris tui, lesus.

359
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:19,346
What?

360
00:47:20,789 --> 00:47:25,396
Another round.
I told Luca it was on the house.

361
00:47:27,961 --> 00:47:31,634
- Why did you cover the mirror?
- It's tradition here when someone dies.

362
00:47:31,635 --> 00:47:33,830
You cover the mirror so
the deceased doesn't

363
00:47:33,854 --> 00:47:36,053
see their reflection
and become a ghost.

364
00:47:36,847 --> 00:47:40,081
- Someone died?
- You didn't hear?

365
00:47:40,227 --> 00:47:42,931
Luca's daughter committed suicide.

366
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:49,471
I can't believe it.
She was just a kid.

367
00:47:49,495 --> 00:47:54,060
12 years old.
Hang herself in his barn.

368
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,747
Hanged herself?

369
00:47:56,994 --> 00:47:58,280
Why?

370
00:47:58,304 --> 00:48:01,629
Why the Addi Constantine's
crop turn to dust?

371
00:48:01,653 --> 00:48:07,265
Why little Stefan struck blind?
It's that place. The abbey.

372
00:48:07,572 --> 00:48:11,954
Whatever evil is up there, it's
leaking out, poisoning us.

373
00:48:14,908 --> 00:48:17,655
And that couple that you took up there
yesterday.

374
00:48:18,628 --> 00:48:21,469
- Who were they?
- A priest and a nun.

375
00:48:21,493 --> 00:48:23,781
Are they still up there?

376
00:48:24,289 --> 00:48:26,950
Yeah, pick them up tomorrow.

377
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:29,107
You recently
discovered the body up

378
00:48:29,132 --> 00:48:31,417
- there..didn't you?
- Yeah Grigore, yeah.

379
00:48:31,441 --> 00:48:35,495
Well, I believe you are
about to discover two more.

380
00:48:48,221 --> 00:48:53,829
An out of the ground, formed
every beast of the field...

381
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:57,336
To every bird of the sky.

382
00:48:57,885 --> 00:49:04,012
Forever the man called the demon creature
at last, it's name.

383
00:49:06,816 --> 00:49:08,437
Valak.

384
00:49:09,763 --> 00:49:12,119
The defiler.

385
00:49:12,143 --> 00:49:14,023
The Profane.

386
00:49:14,047 --> 00:49:16,518
The Marquis of Snakes.

387
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:28,002
Sister.

388
00:49:31,524 --> 00:49:33,811
Sister Irene.

389
00:49:38,819 --> 00:49:43,527
Sister Victoria's death
was a terrible tragedy for the convent...

390
00:49:43,652 --> 00:49:46,148
but we still feel her presence.

391
00:49:46,424 --> 00:49:49,632
She was the most devoted out of any of us.

392
00:49:52,274 --> 00:49:54,561
Excuse me, sister.

393
00:50:07,758 --> 00:50:10,046
Sister Vic...

394
00:50:16,713 --> 00:50:20,449
Forgive us.
We are highly protective of our privacy.

395
00:50:20,473 --> 00:50:24,209
Some other sisters would prefer to not
speak to you, at all.

396
00:50:25,019 --> 00:50:27,782
We appreciate your willingness
to do so.

397
00:50:27,783 --> 00:50:32,695
Sister Oana, can you tell me
about the history of this abbey?

398
00:50:34,203 --> 00:50:37,628
It was built by a duke
in the Dark Ages.

399
00:50:39,326 --> 00:50:41,361
<i>The Duke of St. Carta.</i>

400
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:44,874
<i>He wrote countless texts
on witchcraft and rituals...</i>

401
00:50:45,528 --> 00:50:48,436
in which to call
upon the forces of hell.

402
00:50:48,657 --> 00:50:54,808
Hell used him to open a gateway, so that
an unspeakable evil would walk amongst us.

403
00:51:09,343 --> 00:51:11,627
But the church stormed the castle.

404
00:51:15,579 --> 00:51:19,825
They sealed the gateway,
using an ancient relic...

405
00:51:20,953 --> 00:51:24,054
Containing the blood of Jesus Christ.

406
00:51:28,073 --> 00:51:30,469
The church claimed the
castle for their own...

407
00:51:30,493 --> 00:51:35,169
and our perpetual praying began, to
secure the abbey and contain the evil.

408
00:51:35,193 --> 00:51:40,065
For centuries it worked,
and evil was keep at bay...

409
00:51:40,194 --> 00:51:42,769
until the bombs of war
shook the abbey...

410
00:51:44,015 --> 00:51:47,052
and evil found another way
to open the gateway.

411
00:51:48,014 --> 00:51:53,889
Sister Oana,
last night in the chapel I saw a nun.

412
00:51:54,996 --> 00:52:00,642
She was, she felt anything but holy.

413
00:52:00,806 --> 00:52:03,094
Did you see her too?

414
00:52:03,571 --> 00:52:06,191
I've seen her stalking
the hallways at night.

415
00:52:06,416 --> 00:52:08,580
We all have.

416
00:52:08,704 --> 00:52:11,296
She looks like us,
but she's not one of us.

417
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,839
It's something unholy.

418
00:52:13,039 --> 00:52:16,777
It takes on different forms to deceive us
and prey on our weaknesses.

419
00:52:16,801 --> 00:52:21,593
It appears as a nun so it could hide among
our clothes until it can corrupt us all.

420
00:52:21,617 --> 00:52:25,022
I fear her presence means
the portal has opened again.

421
00:52:25,047 --> 00:52:27,733
It means, Sister Victoria
commit the ultimate sin.

422
00:52:27,834 --> 00:52:29,508
Sister Oana.

423
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:35,099
Sister Ruth is nearly finished
with her prayers.

424
00:52:35,976 --> 00:52:39,097
- It's time you turn to yours.
- Yes sister.

425
00:52:45,549 --> 00:52:48,798
- You haven't taken your vows yet?
- No.

426
00:52:49,122 --> 00:52:53,317
Then, this is not a place for you.
You need to leave, now.

427
00:52:53,318 --> 00:52:54,983
She can't.

428
00:52:55,007 --> 00:52:58,670
The gates have closed.
You must stay until they open again.

429
00:52:58,671 --> 00:53:03,052
- When do they open?
- Sunrise, you must stay the night.

430
00:53:13,245 --> 00:53:15,529
Sister Irene.

431
00:53:28,186 --> 00:53:29,913
Good night, sister.

432
00:53:29,937 --> 00:53:33,110
- Sister, wait.
- Yes.

433
00:53:34,651 --> 00:53:37,522
Sister Victoria had this
in her possession when

434
00:53:37,546 --> 00:53:40,554
she died. Do you happen
to know what it's for?

435
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:42,284
No.

436
00:53:46,672 --> 00:53:48,970
Now please, I must go pray.

437
00:54:25,134 --> 00:54:27,421
Where are you?

438
00:54:29,201 --> 00:54:33,726
You wont find another way in, Father.

439
00:54:34,918 --> 00:54:36,873
Abbess?

440
00:54:47,771 --> 00:54:51,645
What is it that concerns you?

441
00:54:57,163 --> 00:55:03,187
I'm afraid..there is something very
wrong with this place, Abbess.

442
00:55:04,006 --> 00:55:10,011
Like many places in this world,
the abbey has a long history.

443
00:55:10,184 --> 00:55:15,064
Not all good, but we repent.

444
00:55:16,217 --> 00:55:20,770
That nun..I found her, clutching
the key in her hands.

445
00:55:20,794 --> 00:55:22,564
What does it open, Abbess?

446
00:55:23,329 --> 00:55:29,598
It's too late, Father.
Sister Irene is lost.

447
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,263
Abbess?

448
00:56:35,114 --> 00:56:37,217
Sister Irene.

449
00:56:37,241 --> 00:56:41,785
Mary points the way.

450
00:57:11,713 --> 00:57:13,044
Who are you?

451
00:58:10,553 --> 00:58:12,841
God save you.

452
00:58:37,729 --> 00:58:40,185
Sister please, come.

453
00:58:41,235 --> 00:58:43,230
Sister Oana?

454
01:00:14,131 --> 01:00:15,705
Oh God.

455
01:01:47,847 --> 01:01:49,718
Quiet.

456
01:01:55,644 --> 01:01:57,539
The evil grows stronger.

457
01:01:57,563 --> 01:02:00,187
Get your things and meet
me in the chapel, sister.

458
01:02:00,211 --> 01:02:02,672
Only prayer would get
us through the night.

459
01:02:03,072 --> 01:02:05,359
Go, leave.

460
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:08,842
Now.

461
01:02:47,175 --> 01:02:48,978
Santa María, Madre de
Dios, ruega por nosotros

462
01:02:49,002 --> 01:02:51,119
pecadores, ahora y en la
hora de nuestra muerte.

463
01:02:52,272 --> 01:02:54,105
Hello?

464
01:02:54,129 --> 01:02:55,647
Dios Te salve, Maria. Llena eres

465
01:02:55,671 --> 01:02:57,258
de gracia: El Senor es contigo.

466
01:02:57,282 --> 01:03:00,415

01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:49,186
How long have I been dead, Father?

483
01:03:51,383 --> 01:03:53,502
How long?

484
01:03:57,517 --> 01:03:58,843
Daniel?

485
01:03:59,936 --> 01:04:01,684
I'm sorry.

486
01:04:03,687 --> 01:04:05,855
Why didn't you help me?

487
01:04:34,216 --> 01:04:36,921
Mother of God Pray for us...

488
01:04:36,948 --> 01:04:39,120

We need to pray, now!

DELIVERIES

504
01:06:15,001 --> 01:06:18,422
"That's the door the nuns would enter
from to retrieve their supplies".

505
01:06:18,446 --> 01:06:21,232
"So they wouldn't have
to leave the castle".

506
01:07:34,011 --> 01:07:37,098
Holy Mother of God.

507
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:38,953
Frenchy.

508
01:07:38,982 --> 01:07:41,269
Thought you could use some help.

509
01:07:42,328 --> 01:07:44,083
Thank you.

510
01:07:44,107 --> 01:07:49,794
But please, by all means.
Next time, do use the shotgun.

511
01:07:50,841 --> 01:07:53,881
I'm saving that for emergencies, Father.

512
01:07:54,006 --> 01:07:56,878
Hail Mary, full of grace,

the Lord is with you.

526
01:08:39,339 --> 01:08:42,793
Benedicta Tu in mulieribus.

527
01:08:45,306 --> 01:08:47,510
Sister.

528
01:08:48,712 --> 01:08:51,000
Sister Irene.

529
01:08:52,586 --> 01:08:54,873
Father Burke.

530
01:09:01,801 --> 01:09:03,195
It's Father Burke.

531
01:09:03,219 --> 01:09:05,323
He will help us.

532
01:09:05,347 --> 01:09:07,217
Sister.

533
01:09:15,062 --> 01:09:17,266
Sister Irene.

534
01:09:21,548 --> 01:09:25,129
- Thank God, Father.
- Are you all right, sister?

535
01:09:25,555 --> 01:09:27,374
Frenchy?

536
01:09:27,398 --> 01:09:29,067
What happened?

537
01:09:29,068 --> 01:09:32,189
We've been praying, all of us together.

538
01:09:32,535 --> 01:09:37,490
Perpetual etheration, it's the only thing
that's been holding back the evil.

539
01:09:37,514 --> 01:09:39,314
Who's been praying?

540
01:09:39,338 --> 01:09:41,621
All of us. The other nuns.

541
01:10:03,509 --> 01:10:05,336
They were here.

542
01:10:05,636 --> 01:10:08,401
They were praying with me,
when we're attacked.

543
01:10:10,845 --> 01:10:12,973
The nuns tried to warn me.

544
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:15,959
- Visions.
- It felt so real.

545
01:11:07,089 --> 01:11:09,372
There's no one left.

546
01:11:12,237 --> 01:11:14,481
We have our answer, Father.

547
01:11:15,194 --> 01:11:19,014
As if there was any doubt,
before this place is no longer holy.

548
01:11:25,426 --> 01:11:26,791
Our Father.

549
01:11:34,197 --> 01:11:36,316
Father, what do we do?

550
01:11:37,386 --> 01:11:40,267
Get my bag, sister.
Holy cross.

551
01:11:40,291 --> 01:11:42,245
Put some holy water on this.

552
01:11:42,269 --> 01:11:44,850
- Here.
- Hurry! Please father, hurry.

553
01:11:46,993 --> 01:11:49,281
Put her down.
Cover its face.

554
01:11:52,363 --> 01:11:55,275
The Gods out, the demon in you...

555
01:11:55,299 --> 01:12:00,399
In the name of the God, and the Father all
vanity and the power of the Holy Spirit.

556
01:12:00,423 --> 01:12:04,514
I ask this in the name
forefather, Jesus Christ.

557
01:12:04,538 --> 01:12:07,672
Which is the Judge
all the living and the dead...

558
01:12:07,696 --> 01:12:10,191
and the world of fire.

559
01:12:27,892 --> 01:12:30,681
That felt like an emergency.

560
01:12:32,408 --> 01:12:34,323
We're too late.

561
01:12:34,947 --> 01:12:36,651
The evil is free.

562
01:12:36,675 --> 01:12:38,376
No.

563
01:12:38,894 --> 01:12:42,780
For demon to enter our world,
it must possess a human soul.

564
01:12:43,411 --> 01:12:47,219
Sister Victoria must have been the last nun
in this Cloistered.

565
01:12:47,243 --> 01:12:49,495
- You know what you must do.
- I can't.

566
01:12:49,519 --> 01:12:52,323
Then not even God...

567
01:12:55,266 --> 01:12:57,499
It wasn't suicide.

568
01:12:58,651 --> 01:13:00,938
<i>It was a sacrifice...</i>

569
01:13:02,457 --> 01:13:05,213
<i>so the evil wouldn't take her soul.</i>

570
01:13:07,015 --> 01:13:09,689
I did not understand what you just
said, but I ahh...

571
01:13:09,712 --> 01:13:13,943
Sounds like your investigation is complete.
So let's get out the here.

572
01:13:13,967 --> 01:13:17,509
- We can't just leave.
- Oh come on, why the hell not?

573
01:13:19,604 --> 01:13:23,835
We have to seal the gateway,
to contain the evil.

574
01:13:30,779 --> 01:13:32,982
The gateways is in the catacombs.

575
01:13:33,106 --> 01:13:38,150
But we can't close it,
without the relic, the blood of Christ.

576
01:13:38,516 --> 01:13:41,305
'Christ.' Jesus Christ?

577
01:13:43,099 --> 01:13:45,093
Did the sisters tell you where it is?

578
01:13:45,217 --> 01:13:48,767
The Abbess was found dead
in the tunnel to the catacombs.

579
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:52,561
I think I know where that tunnel is.

580
01:13:52,566 --> 01:13:56,196
Good, then that's where we look first.

581
01:13:56,220 --> 01:13:59,222
But Father, before we do...

582
01:14:00,587 --> 01:14:02,980
I'd like to take my vows.

583
01:14:04,186 --> 01:14:06,412
Are you certain?

584
01:14:06,945 --> 01:14:09,148
My visions.

585
01:14:09,177 --> 01:14:14,393
I now know they are miracle of God and
I am ready to commit my life to him.

586
01:14:14,449 --> 01:14:17,237
That sister is a noble act.

587
01:14:17,908 --> 01:14:19,526
It's a shame, but...

588
01:14:21,261 --> 01:14:26,605
By the authority entrusted to me,
and in the name of the church...

589
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:28,917
I receive the vows you have taken.

590
01:14:31,653 --> 01:14:33,940
I earnestly commend you to God.

591
01:14:33,982 --> 01:14:40,135
That your gift of self is made one,
with the sacrifice of the Eucharist...

592
01:14:40,217 --> 01:14:42,211
And might be brought to perfection.

593
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:47,355
May the love of God,
unite you forever and ever.

594
01:14:48,205 --> 01:14:52,413
In nomine Patris et Filii
et Spiritus Sancti.

595
01:14:52,624 --> 01:14:54,589
Amen.

596
01:15:12,180 --> 01:15:14,383
There's nothing here.

597
01:15:14,508 --> 01:15:16,470
There has to be.

598
01:15:16,494 --> 01:15:19,499
They told me this key unlocked
the doors to the relic.

599
01:15:19,523 --> 01:15:21,811
That could be anywhere in the castle.

600
01:15:23,029 --> 01:15:27,350
It is here, don't you see, sister?

601
01:15:27,660 --> 01:15:29,280
What?

602
01:15:31,975 --> 01:15:33,762
Mary points the way.

603
01:16:32,443 --> 01:16:34,730
The blood of Christ.

604
01:16:36,088 --> 01:16:38,299
Holy SHIT.

605
01:16:39,061 --> 01:16:41,348
The Holys'.

606
01:16:49,005 --> 01:16:55,584
Only a true bride of Christ
can wield something so sacred.

607
01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:02,231
Wait.

608
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,755
What is it?

609
01:17:04,779 --> 01:17:08,495
Shouldn't we say a prayer or
something first?

610
01:17:08,517 --> 01:17:11,975
There's a time for prayer,
and a time for action, son.

611
01:17:11,986 --> 01:17:14,042
Now is the time for action.

612
01:17:14,066 --> 01:17:17,831
Also still feels like a time for prayer
as well, Father.

613
01:17:27,063 --> 01:17:29,142
"Finit hic, Deo."

614
01:17:29,650 --> 01:17:31,660
"God ends here."

615
01:17:43,190 --> 01:17:46,936
We need to search everywhere
to find the gateway.

616
01:19:03,196 --> 01:19:06,148
Sister Irene. This way.

617
01:19:11,709 --> 01:19:13,872
Hello?

618
01:19:18,296 --> 01:19:20,583
Sister Irene.

619
01:19:21,124 --> 01:19:22,867
Sister.

620
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:41,139
Irene.

621
01:21:00,503 --> 01:21:04,580
Lord Jesus, in the holy name...

622
01:21:05,102 --> 01:21:08,848
I bind all evil spirits to this fire.

623
01:21:09,542 --> 01:21:13,416
Protect us from evil
with your holy light.

624
01:21:36,253 --> 01:21:39,627
Frenchy, help me.

625
01:21:42,579 --> 01:21:44,489
Of course.

626
01:22:49,773 --> 01:22:52,601
Notre Père qui es aux cieux

627
01:22:52,629 --> 01:22:54,733
Que ton nom soit sanctifi

628
01:22:54,757 --> 01:22:56,960
Que ton r gne vienne

629
01:22:57,638 --> 01:23:00,714
Que ta volont soit faite sur la terre
comme Au ciel

630
01:23:01,284 --> 01:23:03,446
Amen.

631
01:23:23,135 --> 01:23:28,042
You failed.
Just u failed everyone in your life.

632
01:23:34,807 --> 01:23:39,636
Tomorrow, a village will
be missing, you idiot.

633
01:23:39,646 --> 01:23:43,352
You should have kept dreaming
when you had the chance, Frenchman.

634
01:23:43,885 --> 01:23:45,879
I am French-Canadian.

635
01:23:55,019 --> 01:23:56,642
Run.

636
01:23:58,093 --> 01:23:59,839
Frenchy!

637
01:24:02,663 --> 01:24:04,863
No!

638
01:24:20,172 --> 01:24:24,157
Sister... Sister Irene.

639
01:25:38,199 --> 01:25:42,108
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

640
01:27:43,336 --> 01:27:45,163
Come on.

641
01:28:15,812 --> 01:28:19,628
I hope you don’t mind,
is called the 'kiss of life'.

642
01:28:20,587 --> 01:28:23,316
Just call that way.
It's just, it's not really...

643
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:26,813
Frenchy, what's your real name?

644
01:28:27,475 --> 01:28:29,049
Maurice.

645
01:28:30,011 --> 01:28:32,813
Thank you for saving my life, Maurice.

646
01:28:33,641 --> 01:28:35,095
You're welcome.

647
01:29:09,892 --> 01:29:11,603
We should get going.

648
01:29:11,627 --> 01:29:15,209
At your hands O'Lord, we humbly
deliver your servance...

649
01:29:15,632 --> 01:29:17,672
the nuns of St. Carta.

650
01:29:18,421 --> 01:29:21,626
They served You in this life
with strength and faith.

651
01:29:22,165 --> 01:29:25,248
Deliver them now from every evil.

652
01:29:25,257 --> 01:29:29,261
And let them live with you
in perfect grace forever.

653
01:29:29,348 --> 01:29:31,635
Amen.

654
01:29:32,380 --> 01:29:34,916
I thought this ground
wasn't holy anymore.

655
01:29:38,347 --> 01:29:40,634
It is now.

656
01:29:42,678 --> 01:29:44,816
Will you stay on in Biertan?

657
01:29:44,839 --> 01:29:49,632
I think I have live feel of Romania.
My father was a tomato farmer.

658
01:29:50,866 --> 01:29:53,153
Maybe I'll try that for while.

659
01:29:53,587 --> 01:29:56,696
Sounds little boring for a
world traveler like you.

660
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:58,547
Certainly hope so.

661
01:30:14,261 --> 01:30:16,868
20 YEARS LATER

662
01:30:17,431 --> 01:30:22,887
An exorcism can be very dangerous not only
for the victim, but for anyone in the room.

663
01:30:22,910 --> 01:30:26,432
Take Maurice Theriault.
His friends called him Frenchy.

664
01:30:26,456 --> 01:30:30,066
He was a French Canadian farmer.
Nothing more than a third grade education.

665
01:30:30,090 --> 01:30:32,711
After he was possessed...

666
01:30:34,346 --> 01:30:36,577
He spoke some of the best
Latin I had ever heard.

667
01:30:36,601 --> 01:30:41,757
And like that, an upside down cross
started to appear from within his body.

668
01:30:41,781 --> 01:30:45,606
Which brings me to the three stages
of demonic activities.

669
01:30:45,657 --> 01:30:47,066
Infestation...

670
01:30:47,551 --> 01:30:49,106
Oppression...

671
01:30:49,130 --> 01:30:50,996
Possession.
