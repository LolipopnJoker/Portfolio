Yeah, it didn't sound right to me, either.

715
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:10,380
I can't believe my parents
didn't tell me about this.

716
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:12,546
If people knew
where babies really came from,

717
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:13,842
they'd never have one.

718
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,722
Same thing with hot dogs, by the way.

I don't remember this place?

00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:21,353
BOSS BABY: Oh, you did.

722
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:23,765
But after normal babies
get their pacifiers taken away...

723
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,854
you forget all about Baby Corp.

724
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,359
How come you're not normal?

725
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:29,737
A few of us, the best of the best...

726
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,522

00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,445

728
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,943
For the ultimate honor.

729
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:38,529
Upper management.

730
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:42,200
This, Templeton,
is where all the action is.

FEMALE AUTOMATED VOICE:
<i>Nap time in Sector G.</i>

732
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,296
So this whole place is run by babies?

733
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:48,377
Yep.

734
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,712
My Dad says,
"Those who can, do."

735
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,297
"And those who can't,
supervise."

736
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:53,795
Your father is a hippie.

What happens when you grow up?

739
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:57,931
Well, we don't.

00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:01,390

Formula break is over!

We're in a crisis here!

744
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:08,977
Don't you know we're in a crisis here?

745
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:10,065
Who is that?

746
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,776
That is my boss.
Big Boss Baby.

747
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,906
What is she screaming about?

748
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,487
Well, see this pie chart?

749
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:18,949
Wow, it looks like a giant pie.

750
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,580
It represents all the love
there is in the world.

751
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,991
- I love pie.
- Who doesn't?

752
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:23,999
- Apple.
- Fine.

753
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:25,080
- No, cherry!
- Perfect!

754
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,118
- Not pumpkin.
- Okay.

755
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:27,082
That's a vegetable.

756
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:30,623
Point is, the puppies' slice
is getting bigger and bigger.

757
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:31,749
(BABY CRYING)

758
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,584
They're stealing all our love!

759
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:35,754
Oh, just like you did to me.

760
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:36,921
Exactly.

761
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,090
- Oh!
- And if this keeps up...

762
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,805
there might not be enough pie
left for babies.

763
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:42,934
No pie?

764
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,766
No pie.

765
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,357
So, my mission...
Whoa!

766
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,282
...is to find out
what this new puppy is.

767
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,444
So you're, like,
on a spy mission? Cool!

768
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:02,284
Yes! Cool!
And if... When I succeed...

769
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,824
I'll become a Baby Corp legend.

770
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:07,618
Like Super Big Boss Baby, Mega Boss Baby...

771
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:09,628
Seriously Big Boss Baby...

772
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:11,372
and him.

773
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,125
Whoa, now that's a big, fat baby.

774
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,718
No, that's Big Fat Boss Baby.

775
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:20,632
This is Super Colossal Big Fat Boss Baby.

776
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:22,550
He was the youngest Chief Executive Infant

777
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:24,135
in the history of the company.

778
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,974
Was? What happened to him?

779
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,809
Retired, years ago.

780
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:29,975
But I still try and live up to his legend.

781
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:31,813
In every situation, I ask myself...

782
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:33,979
"W-W-S-C-B-F-B-B-D?

783
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,322

Big Fat Boss Baby Do?"

784
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:40,861
So that's all you get?
Your picture on the wall?

785
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,323
Come here!

786
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:44,075
I'll get a promotion.

787
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:46,206

00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:48,208
with my own private potty.

789
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:49,744
Wow.

790
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,334
So when you're done,
you're coming back here?

791
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,089
A-S-A-P, T-i-m.

00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:56,842

I belong behind a desk.

So help me, I will nail
his diaper to the wall!

00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,515

from that little Boss Baby...

798
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:09,180
that we sent down to the Templetons?

- You're fired!

Oh, no.

If he doesn't come up with answers...

804
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:18,614
he is fired, retired!

805
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,524

If I don't find out what that
new puppy is and fast...

00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:49,220
not only will I not get that promotion...

819
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,638
I could get fired!

00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:53,398
Hey, relax.

00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,776
I'm sure there's other
cool jobs for babies, right?

Meanwhile, two days goes by like that.

If I'm fired, they'll take away my formula.

00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:07,613
I will turn into a normal baby...

829
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:09,578
and live here forever with you.

- Yes!

There's plenty of love for everyone.

01:27:03,135 --> 01:27:04,046
Even me?

1959
01:27:04,219 --> 01:27:05,710
Especially you.

1960
01:27:05,887 --> 01:27:07,253
Just ask your Uncle Ted.

THEODORE: Hey, kid,
I hear you're gonna have a baby sister.

1962
01:27:09,933 --> 01:27:11,174
I wanted a horse.

1963
01:27:11,351 --> 01:27:13,934
THEODORE: Here you go, kid.
Go get yourself a horse.

1964
01:27:14,104 --> 01:27:16,892
You know, I'm proud of you, Leslie.

<i>What the world needs now</i>

1969
01:27:48,346 --> 01:27:51,089
<i>Is love, sweet love</i>

1970
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:57,395
<i>It's the only thing that
there's just too little of</i>

1971
01:27:57,564 --> 01:28:00,773
<i>What the world needs now</i>

1972
01:28:01,610 --> 01:28:03,818
<i>Is love, sweet love</i>

1973
01:28:04,738 --> 01:28:07,025
<i>No, not just for some</i>

1974
01:28:07,783 --> 01:28:11,197
<i>But for everyone</i>

1975
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:15,910
<i>Lord, we don't
need another mountain</i>

1976
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:22,121
<i>There are mountains
and hillsides enough to climb</i>

1977
01:28:23,089 --> 01:28:28,426
<i>There are oceans
and rivers enough to cross</i>

1978
01:28:28,887 --> 01:28:32,676
<i>Enough to last
till the end of time</i>

1979
01:28:34,476 --> 01:28:37,844
<i>What the world needs now</i>

1980
01:28:38,814 --> 01:28:40,897

<i>Is love, sweet love</i>

1984
01:28:55,497 --> 01:29:00,288
<i>No, notjust for
some but for everyone</i>

1985
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:06,460
<i>Lord,
we don't need another meadow</i>

1986
01:29:06,758 --> 01:29:09,000
<i>There are cornfields</i>

1987
01:29:09,094 --> 01:29:12,303
<i>And wheat
fields enough to grow</i>

1988
01:29:13,139 --> 01:29:15,096
<i>There are sunbeams</i>

1989
01:29:15,183 --> 01:29:18,392
<i>And moonbeams enough to shine</i>

1990
01:29:18,854 --> 01:29:24,191
<i>Oh, listen,
Lord if you want to know</i>

1991
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:31,064
<i>What the world needs now</i>

<i>What the world needs now
is love, sweet love</i>

1995
01:29:47,632 --> 01:29:50,045
<i>No, notjust for some</i>

1996
01:29:50,135 --> 01:29:52,548
<i>But for...</i>

1997
01:29:56,558 --> 01:29:58,094
<i>Everyone</i>

1998
01:30:05,483 --> 01:30:09,318
<i>What the world needs now</i>

1999
01:30:12,908 --> 01:30:15,446

BOTH: Argh!

2004
01:30:25,795 --> 01:30:27,002
MOM: All right, guys.

2005
01:30:27,172 --> 01:30:28,208
Time for bed.

2006
01:30:28,381 --> 01:30:30,464
Oh, come on, Mom.
Just a little longer.

2007
01:30:30,634 --> 01:30:32,796
MOM: Okay.
(LAUGHS)

2008
01:30:34,971 --> 01:30:37,179
<i>Need a little love</i>

2009
01:30:38,266 --> 01:30:40,508
<i>Oh, we need love</i>

2010
01:30:44,314 --> 01:30:50,811
<i>What we need is love</i>

2011
01:37:10,199 --> 01:37:13,613
<i>Wake up, little halflings!
It's time to leave.</i>

2012
01:37:13,786 --> 01:37:17,200
<i>Go and live
your peasant lives.</i>

2013
01:37:18,249 --> 01:37:19,706
<i>Be gone with you!</i>
