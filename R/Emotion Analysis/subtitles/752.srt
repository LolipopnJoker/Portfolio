I saw that.

196
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,241
Um...

197
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:06,660
[both squeal]

198
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,911
Oh, how I've missed you!

199
00:07:08,911 --> 00:07:10,955
-Sebastian.

200
00:07:08,911 --> 00:07:10,955
-Your Majesty.

201
00:07:10,955 --> 00:07:13,207
-Sheila.

202
00:07:10,955 --> 00:07:13,207
-Majesty.

203
00:07:13,207 --> 00:07:14,668
What have you been up to?

204
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:16,461
Just partying, girl,

205
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:16,461
you know.

206
00:07:16,461 --> 00:07:18,171
Ohh! Oh, your foot!

207
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,590
I'm so sorry. Are y...

208
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,590
Are you all right?

209
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,842
I'll survive,

210
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,842
Your Highness.

211
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:24,927
The fault was

212
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:24,927
entirely my own.

213
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,346
I apologize.

214
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:28,598
Are you sure you don't want

215
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:28,598
to exchange licenses

216
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:30,016
and proof of insurance?

217
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,352
No, no, these shoes

218
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,352
were a little big anyway,

219
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:34,854
and swelling should

220
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:34,854
help them fit better.

221
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:38,650
[tango]

222
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:39,984
Whoa!

223
00:07:39,984 --> 00:07:41,736
Aha.

224
00:07:43,613 --> 00:07:45,615
Get a load

225
00:07:43,613 --> 00:07:45,615
of this guy.

226
00:07:45,615 --> 00:07:46,825
[both giggle]

227
00:07:46,825 --> 00:07:48,284
Shimmy-shim.

228
00:07:48,284 --> 00:07:52,497
Whoa, hey.

229
00:07:48,284 --> 00:07:52,497
Hey, hey, hey...

230
00:07:52,497 --> 00:07:54,708
You are

231
00:07:52,497 --> 00:07:54,708
a beautiful dancer.

232
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,334
Oh, why,

233
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,334
thank you so much.

234
00:07:56,334 --> 00:08:00,547
...like a deer or a chipmunk

235
00:07:56,334 --> 00:08:00,547
in the forest.

236
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:03,800
Looks like he's trying

237
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:03,800
to land a plane.

238
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,012
Woodland animals

239
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,012
are a lovely thing

240
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,012
to be compared to.

241
00:08:08,012 --> 00:08:09,556
May I?

242
00:08:13,434 --> 00:08:15,562
Your timing is impeccable.

243
00:08:13,434 --> 00:08:15,562
Thank you.

244
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:16,979
You're welcome,

245
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:16,979
Your Highness.

246
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:20,233
-Mia. I like

247
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:20,233
to be called Mia.

248
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:20,233
-Mm.

249
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,735
And you are...?

250
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:24,070
Nicholas.

251
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:24,070
Just Nicholas.

252
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:28,199
Well, I'm very glad

253
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:28,199
to see that my clumsiness

254
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:28,199
hasn't affected your dancing.

255
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:30,702
I'm sorry I stepped

256
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:30,702
on your foot.

257
00:08:30,702 --> 00:08:34,372
You can step on my foot

258
00:08:30,702 --> 00:08:34,372
anytime.

259
00:08:34,372 --> 00:08:37,250
[both] Aw...

260
00:08:40,503 --> 00:08:43,590
It is

261
00:08:40,503 --> 00:08:43,590
Prince Jacques' turn.

262
00:08:48,177 --> 00:08:50,054
Your Highness.

263
00:08:51,472 --> 00:08:56,770
If this were my party,

264
00:08:51,472 --> 00:08:56,770
we'd be kissing by now.

265
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,772
That's Prince Jacques.

266
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,481
He's about 12 years old.

267
00:09:00,481 --> 00:09:02,400
He's a very

268
00:09:00,481 --> 00:09:02,400
precocious prince.

269
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,028
He wears aftershave

270
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,028
to make people think

271
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,028
that he's older.

272
00:09:06,028 --> 00:09:08,865
May I blow in your ear?

273
00:09:08,865 --> 00:09:11,701
Can you reach it?

274
00:09:12,702 --> 00:09:14,579
-Princess..

275
00:09:12,702 --> 00:09:14,579
-Hmm?

276
00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:17,749
There's someone

277
00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:17,749
from Parliament

278
00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:17,749
you should meet, hmm?

279
00:09:17,749 --> 00:09:19,292
Charlotte, how many members

280
00:09:17,749 --> 00:09:19,292
of Parliament are there?

281
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,586
Only two left,

282
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,586
Your Highness.

283
00:09:21,586 --> 00:09:23,588
Ah. Hmm?

284
00:09:23,588 --> 00:09:25,799
-Aah! Oh, dear.

285
00:09:23,588 --> 00:09:25,799
-Your Highness, pardon me.

286
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,675
I am so sorry.

287
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,675
It was only an accident.

288
00:09:27,675 --> 00:09:29,928
It's fine, it's fine.

289
00:09:27,675 --> 00:09:29,928
No harm, no foul, no bruise.

290
00:09:29,928 --> 00:09:33,306
[laughs]

291
00:09:29,928 --> 00:09:33,306
Thank you so much.

292
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,558
You should be more careful,

293
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,558
Your Royal Highness.

294
00:09:35,558 --> 00:09:39,353
Somebody might try

295
00:09:35,558 --> 00:09:39,353
to take that away from you.

296
00:09:39,353 --> 00:09:43,524
Oh, I hope not,

297
00:09:39,353 --> 00:09:43,524
but thank you so much

298
00:09:39,353 --> 00:09:43,524
for all your help.

299
00:09:44,358 --> 00:09:46,986
Someone like me.

300
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,196
<i>Welcome back</i>

301
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,196
<i>to</i> Eggs With Elsie.

302
00:09:49,196 --> 00:09:53,117

305

Oh, hi.

306
00:09:53,117 --> 00:09:55,662
How's it going?

307
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:56,955
[turns off TV]

308
00:09:56,955 --> 00:09:58,873
I'm so sorry.

309
00:09:56,955 --> 00:09:58,873
I thought I was alone.

310
00:09:58,873 --> 00:10:01,626
No, miss. I'm Brigitte,

311
00:09:58,873 --> 00:10:01,626
if it pleases you,

312
00:09:58,873 --> 00:10:01,626
at your service.

313
00:10:01,626 --> 00:10:03,628
And I'm Brigitta,

314
00:10:01,626 --> 00:10:03,628
miss.

315
00:10:03,628 --> 00:10:05,296
Brigitte and Brigitta?

316
00:10:05,296 --> 00:10:08,508
I'm Mia, and, please,

317
00:10:05,296 --> 00:10:08,508
don't curtsy like that.

318
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:11,719
-Not like this?

319
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:11,719
How do you like it?

320
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:11,719
-Like this, maybe?

321
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:15,431
No, no, no,

322
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:15,431
I didn't mean like,

323
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:15,431
you know, this...

324
00:10:15,431 --> 00:10:18,017
No, no, not that way.

325
00:10:15,431 --> 00:10:18,017
I didn't mean it at, um...

326
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,102
The queen bids you

327
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,102
good morning, Princess.

328
00:10:20,102 --> 00:10:22,229
-She's in session

329
00:10:20,102 --> 00:10:22,229
with Parliament.

330
00:10:20,102 --> 00:10:22,229
-OK.

331
00:10:22,229 --> 00:10:24,315
I see you've met

332
00:10:22,229 --> 00:10:24,315
your lady's maids.

333
00:10:24,315 --> 00:10:26,442
Yeah. Um...

334
00:10:24,315 --> 00:10:26,442
[laughs]

335
00:10:26,442 --> 00:10:28,945
[whispers] How do you

336
00:10:26,442 --> 00:10:28,945
turn off the curtsies?

337
00:10:28,945 --> 00:10:32,072
Oh. Enough bowing.

338
00:10:28,945 --> 00:10:32,072
Back to your chores.

339
00:10:32,072 --> 00:10:34,742
Her Majesty will meet you

340
00:10:32,072 --> 00:10:34,742
in one hour at the throne room.

341
00:10:34,742 --> 00:10:37,996
-OK.

342
00:10:34,742 --> 00:10:37,996
-I'm sorry your suite

343
00:10:34,742 --> 00:10:37,996
isn't ready yet,

344
00:10:37,996 --> 00:10:40,289
but you're welcome to stay here

345
00:10:37,996 --> 00:10:40,289
in Her Majesty's suite...

346
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:41,833
No, no, no, it's fine.

347
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,961
Hey, can I explore

348
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,961
the palace a little bit?

349
00:10:44,961 --> 00:10:46,713
-Of course.

350
00:10:44,961 --> 00:10:46,713
-[dog barks]

351
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:48,965
Well, you've met Maurice.

352
00:10:48,965 --> 00:10:50,008
[barks]

353
00:10:50,008 --> 00:10:51,634
[Mia] Hey, Mo.

354
00:10:51,634 --> 00:10:54,345
The throne room in an hour?

355
00:10:54,345 --> 00:10:56,764
[man] The parliament

356
00:10:54,345 --> 00:10:56,764
of Genovia is in session,

357
00:10:56,764 --> 00:10:58,599
Prime Minister Motaz

358
00:10:56,764 --> 00:10:58,599
presiding.

359
00:10:58,599 --> 00:11:01,268
Viscount Mabrey,

360
00:10:58,599 --> 00:11:01,268
you have the floor.

361
00:11:01,268 --> 00:11:04,022
[man #2] Sir Mabrey,

362
00:11:01,268 --> 00:11:04,022
<i>s'il vous plait.</i>

363
00:11:04,022 --> 00:11:06,941
As we all know,

364
00:11:04,022 --> 00:11:06,941
the 21st birthday...

365
00:11:06,941 --> 00:11:09,736
-[snoring]

366
00:11:06,941 --> 00:11:09,736
-...of an heir

367
00:11:06,941 --> 00:11:09,736
to the Genovian bloodline

368
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:12,697
is indeed a matter

369
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:12,697
of great public significance.

370
00:11:12,697 --> 00:11:16,034
It signifies

371
00:11:12,697 --> 00:11:16,034
that this young person

372
00:11:16,034 --> 00:11:18,452
is eligible

373
00:11:16,034 --> 00:11:18,452
to assume the crown.

374
00:11:18,452 --> 00:11:22,790
Indeed, we are well aware

375
00:11:18,452 --> 00:11:22,790
of this, Viscount.

376
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,751
The queen has already indicated

377
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:27,420
that Princess Mia intends

378
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:27,420
to learn more at her side

379
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,881
before assuming the throne.

380
00:11:29,881 --> 00:11:34,635
It was not Princess Mia

381
00:11:29,881 --> 00:11:34,635
to whom I was referring.

382
00:11:55,113 --> 00:11:57,951
Oh, wow.

383
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:04,832
King Chevalier was

384
00:12:04,832 --> 00:12:09,503
the great-great-

385
00:12:04,832 --> 00:12:09,503
great-grandfather of...

386
00:12:09,503 --> 00:12:11,255
Hello?

387
00:12:11,255 --> 00:12:13,841
Uh....

388
00:12:13,841 --> 00:12:16,302
[clears throat]

389
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,721
Proceed.

390
00:12:22,558 --> 00:12:25,143
[gasps]

391
00:12:27,271 --> 00:12:29,482
Nice.

392
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,153
Hello?

393
00:12:36,864 --> 00:12:39,700
[squeals] OK.

394
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,577
Ooh.

395
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:59,846
[Viscount Mabrey] So, as of

396
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:59,846
the 20th of October last year,

397
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:04,433
on the occasion

398
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:04,433
of his 21st birthday,

399
00:13:04,433 --> 00:13:07,645
another Genovian

400
00:13:04,433 --> 00:13:07,645
of the royal bloodline

401
00:13:07,645 --> 00:13:10,606
became eligible

402
00:13:07,645 --> 00:13:10,606
to assume the throne.

403
00:13:10,606 --> 00:13:12,066
What?

404
00:13:12,066 --> 00:13:13,526
My nephew,

405
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,069
Lord Devereaux.

406
00:13:15,069 --> 00:13:17,363
I beg your pardon.

407
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:21,617
My nephew's mother

408
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:21,617
was my wife's sister,

409
00:13:21,617 --> 00:13:24,328
and therefore, Your Majesty,

410
00:13:24,328 --> 00:13:26,204
I am pleased to say

411
00:13:26,204 --> 00:13:28,833
that my nephew is ready

412
00:13:26,204 --> 00:13:28,833
to take his place

413
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:32,170
as Genovia's rightful king.

414
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:37,091
Shut<i> up.</i>

415
00:13:37,091 --> 00:13:39,593
I beg your pardon?

416
00:13:39,593 --> 00:13:40,887
I mean, um...

417
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:43,597
Uh, "shut up"

418
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:43,597
doesn't always mean...

419
00:13:43,597 --> 00:13:44,682
shut up.

420
00:13:44,682 --> 00:13:45,933
[speaking French]

421
00:13:45,933 --> 00:13:48,019
In America,

422
00:13:45,933 --> 00:13:48,019
it's like "Oh, my,"

423
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:49,436
"Gee whiz,"

424
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:49,436
"Wow."

425
00:13:49,436 --> 00:13:51,355
Thank you,

426
00:13:49,436 --> 00:13:51,355
Mr. Prime Minister.

427
00:13:51,355 --> 00:13:54,859
But isn't Princess Mia

428
00:13:51,355 --> 00:13:54,859
first in line to ascend

429
00:13:51,355 --> 00:13:54,859
the throne?

430
00:13:54,859 --> 00:13:56,110
Not yet.

431
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,695
Genovian law states

432
00:13:57,695 --> 00:14:02,533
that a princess must marry

433
00:13:57,695 --> 00:14:02,533
before she can take the throne.

434
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:05,078
We have never enforced

435
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:05,078
that law.

436
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:07,788
A man doesn't have to marry

437
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:07,788
to be king.

438
00:14:07,788 --> 00:14:11,167
This is the 21st century,

439
00:14:07,788 --> 00:14:11,167
for heaven's sake.

440
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:15,295
My granddaughter should be given

441
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:15,295
the same rights as any man.

442
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,297
Yeah! [gasps]

443
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,763
[Palimore] Genovia shall

444
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,763
have no queen

445
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:27,058
lest she be bound

446
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:27,058
in matrimony.

447
00:14:27,058 --> 00:14:29,309
Lord Palimore.

448
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:34,815
That is the law of Genovia

449
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:34,815
for the last 300 years.

450
00:14:34,815 --> 00:14:39,695
Princess Mia

451
00:14:34,815 --> 00:14:39,695
is not qualified to rule

452
00:14:34,815 --> 00:14:39,695
because she is unmarried.

453
00:14:39,695 --> 00:14:41,948
And forgive me,

454
00:14:39,695 --> 00:14:41,948
Your Majesty.

455
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:45,159
Not all of us are sure

456
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:45,159
that the princess

457
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:51,082
is the most suitable choice

458
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:51,082
to govern our great nation.

459
00:14:51,082 --> 00:14:52,833
[men] Ooh.

460
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,794
Now, now, gentlemen,

461
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,794
gentlemen, please.

462
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:57,630
I suggest

463
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:57,630
this honored body

464
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:01,050
allow Princess Mia

465
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:01,050
one year,

466
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,219
during which time

467
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,219
she must marry,

468
00:15:03,219 --> 00:15:06,222
or she forfeits

469
00:15:03,219 --> 00:15:06,222
the throne of Genovia

470
00:15:06,222 --> 00:15:07,807
to young Lord Devereaux.

471
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:09,142
What? No.

472
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:11,894
I object.

473
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:11,894
I object most strongly.

474
00:15:11,894 --> 00:15:13,854
-Sixty days.

475
00:15:11,894 --> 00:15:13,854
-Two months.

476
00:15:13,854 --> 00:15:15,397
[man] 60 days?

477
00:15:15,397 --> 00:15:17,357
30 days.

478
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:22,196
How could Parliament expect me

479
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:22,196
to fall in love in 30 days?

480
00:15:22,196 --> 00:15:25,241
It's like...

481
00:15:22,196 --> 00:15:25,241
It's like it's a big trick

482
00:15:25,241 --> 00:15:28,494
to get me to have

483
00:15:25,241 --> 00:15:28,494
an arranged marriage or--

484
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:32,248
No. That's it, there's no "or."

485
00:15:32,248 --> 00:15:35,668
An arranged marriage

486
00:15:32,248 --> 00:15:35,668
is my only choice.

487
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:40,547
What kind of person agrees

488
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:40,547
to an arranged marriage?

489
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:46,137
Uh... well, you agreed

490
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:46,137
to an arranged marriage.

491
00:15:46,137 --> 00:15:47,387
Right.

492
00:15:47,387 --> 00:15:49,932
Yes, I did,

493
00:15:49,932 --> 00:15:52,810
and it turned out

494
00:15:49,932 --> 00:15:52,810
quite splendidly.

495
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:55,855
He was my best friend.

496
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:58,691
We grew very fond

497
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:58,691
of each other.

498
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:01,068
Yeah, I'm sure, Grandma,

499
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:01,068
but...

500
00:16:01,068 --> 00:16:05,531
I dream of love,

501
00:16:01,068 --> 00:16:05,531
not... fondness.

502
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,533
But you don't have to

503
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,533
do this, Mia.

504
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,619
You don't have to

505
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,619
become queen.

506
00:16:12,288 --> 00:16:15,374
It's just so unfair.

507
00:16:21,255 --> 00:16:23,799
[father]<i> Amelia...</i>

508
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:27,803
[together] ...courage is not

509
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:27,803
the absence of fear...

510
00:16:27,803 --> 00:16:29,805
[Mia] ...but rather

511
00:16:27,803 --> 00:16:29,805
the judgment

512
00:16:29,805 --> 00:16:33,100
that something else

513
00:16:29,805 --> 00:16:33,100
is more important

514
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,812
than fear.

515
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:43,736
There are 550 years

516
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:43,736
of Renaldis on these walls,

517
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:47,907
and I will be up there

518
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:47,907
next to my father.

519
00:16:50,117 --> 00:16:55,497
I'm sure I want my chance

520
00:16:50,117 --> 00:16:55,497
to make a difference

521
00:16:50,117 --> 00:16:55,497
as a ruler.

522
00:16:55,497 --> 00:16:59,168
Spoken like a true queen.

523
00:17:04,715 --> 00:17:06,300
[Mabrey]<i> You, my boy,</i>

524
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,761
a true-born Genovian,

525
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,055
you should be our king.

526
00:17:11,055 --> 00:17:13,182
I agree,

527
00:17:13,182 --> 00:17:17,103
but... how can we

528
00:17:13,182 --> 00:17:17,103
make it happen?

529
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:18,896
Give me one of your arrows.

530
00:17:18,896 --> 00:17:21,440
I'm going to show you

531
00:17:18,896 --> 00:17:21,440
a trick that I learnt

532
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,776
from an old

533
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,776
Italian philosopher,

534
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,694
Niccolo Machiavelli.

535
00:17:25,694 --> 00:17:27,654
I can make this dart

536
00:17:27,654 --> 00:17:31,867
hit the bull's-eye every time.

537
00:17:33,035 --> 00:17:36,372
Haah!

538
00:17:36,372 --> 00:17:40,376
Yes, but...

539
00:17:36,372 --> 00:17:40,376
that is cheating.

540
00:17:40,376 --> 00:17:42,502
You've got it.

541
00:17:42,502 --> 00:17:46,257
[Queen] Lord Devereaux will be

542
00:17:42,502 --> 00:17:46,257
arriving shortly, Mrs. Cout,

543
00:17:46,257 --> 00:17:49,635
-with his snake of an uncle.

544
00:17:46,257 --> 00:17:49,635
-Yes, Your Majesty.

545
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,595
-Your Majesty...

546
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,595
-Hmm?

547
00:17:51,595 --> 00:17:53,555
I know Lionel is

548
00:17:53,555 --> 00:17:55,308
the Prime Minister's nephew and

549
00:17:53,555 --> 00:17:55,308
he's interning for the summer

550
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:57,517
because he wants to learn

551
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:57,517
about security,

552
00:17:57,517 --> 00:18:00,020
but he never leaves my side.

553
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,064
He sticks to me

554
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,064
like Velcro, madam.

555
00:18:02,064 --> 00:18:04,024
It won't last very long.

556
00:18:04,024 --> 00:18:06,068
He returns to school

557
00:18:04,024 --> 00:18:06,068
in the autumn.

558
00:18:06,068 --> 00:18:07,903
He wants an audience

559
00:18:06,068 --> 00:18:07,903
with you.

560
00:18:07,903 --> 00:18:10,072
-What, now?

561
00:18:07,903 --> 00:18:10,072
-Now.

562
00:18:10,072 --> 00:18:12,408
Lionel?

563
00:18:13,784 --> 00:18:15,744
Short.

564
00:18:15,744 --> 00:18:19,290
I don't know if you've met

565
00:18:15,744 --> 00:18:19,290
Mrs. Cout, our housekeeper,

566
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:22,001
and Priscilla and Olivia,

567
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:22,001
my lady's maids.

568
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:24,544
I'm doing a background check

569
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:24,544
on Olivia.

570
00:18:24,544 --> 00:18:28,007
Oh, that's not necessary,

571
00:18:24,544 --> 00:18:28,007
Lionel.

572
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:30,968
Everybody in this room

573
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:30,968
has high-priority clearance.

574
00:18:30,968 --> 00:18:33,304
Of course,

575
00:18:30,968 --> 00:18:33,304
of course.

576
00:18:33,304 --> 00:18:35,931
-Your Majesty.

577
00:18:33,304 --> 00:18:35,931
-Hmm?

578
00:18:35,931 --> 00:18:38,725
I would gladly

579
00:18:35,931 --> 00:18:38,725
take a bullet for you.

580
00:18:38,725 --> 00:18:40,644
Oh, how brave.

581
00:18:40,644 --> 00:18:44,023
Most interns don't even want

582
00:18:40,644 --> 00:18:44,023
to fetch me my tea.

583
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:47,234
The limousine

584
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:47,234
is at the gates, madam.

585
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:56,202
[Queen] The viscount is not

586
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:56,202
staying. Just the nephew.

587
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:58,371
Joseph, I want you

588
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:58,371
to protect him

589
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:00,706
and keep your eye on him

590
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:00,706
at all times.

591
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:03,000
-Of course. Lionel.

592
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:03,000
-Oh, hello.

593
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,335
So, is this all right

594
00:19:04,335 --> 00:19:05,752
to welcome the viscount

595
00:19:04,335 --> 00:19:05,752
and his nephew?

596
00:19:05,752 --> 00:19:08,088
Very appropriate

597
00:19:05,752 --> 00:19:08,088
and pretty.

598
00:19:08,088 --> 00:19:12,510
Oh, I can't believe Parliament

599
00:19:08,088 --> 00:19:12,510
invited the guy who's trying

600
00:19:08,088 --> 00:19:12,510
to steal the throne

601
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,970
to stay here with us

602
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,970
at the palace.

603
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:17,014
Oh, no, Parliament

604
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:17,014
didn't invite him.

605
00:19:17,014 --> 00:19:19,308
-I did.

606
00:19:17,014 --> 00:19:19,308
-Wha...?

607
00:19:19,308 --> 00:19:22,019
I offered to have him

608
00:19:19,308 --> 00:19:22,019
hung by his toes

609
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:23,603
in our courtyard.

610
00:19:23,603 --> 00:19:26,232
-Excuse me.

611
00:19:23,603 --> 00:19:26,232
-Yeah.

612
00:19:23,603 --> 00:19:26,232
What about Joe's suggestion?

613
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:28,901
No. If there's any

614
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:28,901
mischief going on,

615
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:32,821
I'd prefer it be

616
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:32,821
right under my nose.

617
00:19:36,325 --> 00:19:38,452
It's not a very difficult

618
00:19:36,325 --> 00:19:38,452
job, you know.

619
00:19:38,452 --> 00:19:42,248
You just have to open the door

620
00:19:38,452 --> 00:19:42,248
before the passenger dies

621
00:19:38,452 --> 00:19:42,248
of old age.

622
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:44,124
Hello. I'm here

623
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:44,124
to welcome you.

624
00:19:44,124 --> 00:19:47,044
Your staff is incompetent

625
00:19:44,124 --> 00:19:47,044
and unreliable.

626
00:19:47,044 --> 00:19:50,464
I just so don't want

627
00:19:47,044 --> 00:19:50,464
to be nice to this guy.

628
00:19:50,464 --> 00:19:53,092
He is rude, he's arrogant

629
00:19:50,464 --> 00:19:53,092
and self-centered, he's...

630
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:54,552
Have you met him?

631
00:19:54,552 --> 00:19:57,012
I ju-- No.

632
00:19:57,012 --> 00:19:58,222
Neither have I.

633
00:19:58,222 --> 00:20:00,391
Yeah, but he probably is,

634
00:19:58,222 --> 00:20:00,391
Grandma.

635
00:20:00,391 --> 00:20:03,227
I mean, like now,

636
00:20:00,391 --> 00:20:03,227
all of a sudden, out of nowhere,

637
00:20:03,227 --> 00:20:05,604
he wants to be

638
00:20:03,227 --> 00:20:05,604
the King of Genovia?

639
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:07,231
What is that about?

640
00:20:07,231 --> 00:20:08,815
Ohh, tush.

641
00:20:08,815 --> 00:20:11,444
Whatever he is,

642
00:20:08,815 --> 00:20:11,444
we will be charm itself.

643
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:14,863
We will present ourselves

644
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:14,863

645
00:20:14,863 --> 00:20:18,992
[Majordomo]

646
00:20:14,863 --> 00:20:18,992
Announcing Viscount Mabry

647
00:20:14,863 --> 00:20:18,992

649
00:20:24,582 --> 00:20:26,666
[Mabrey] Your Majesty.

650
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,128
-Your Highness.

651
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,128
-[Queen] Mabrey.

652
00:20:29,128 --> 00:20:31,755
[Mabrey] Ma'am,

653
00:20:29,128 --> 00:20:31,755
may I introduce my nephew,

654
00:20:31,755 --> 00:20:34,800
Lord Nicholas Devereaux.

655
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,387
Nicholas, we are delighted

656
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,387
to make your acquaintance.

657
00:20:38,387 --> 00:20:40,889
Your Majesty,

658
00:20:38,387 --> 00:20:40,889
the pleasure is all mine,

659
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:43,892
and thank you so much

660
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:43,892
for inviting me to stay

661
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:43,892
at the palace.

662
00:20:43,892 --> 00:20:47,438
May I present

663
00:20:43,892 --> 00:20:47,438
my granddaughter, Mia.

664
00:20:47,438 --> 00:20:49,689
Your Highness.

665
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:55,404
Mia, would you care

666
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:55,404
to welcome our guest?

667
00:20:55,404 --> 00:20:57,615
[sighs]

668
00:21:00,784 --> 00:21:03,579
<i>Lord</i> Nicholas.

669
00:21:03,579 --> 00:21:06,081
Uhh! Humph!

670
00:21:06,081 --> 00:21:08,459
[laughs]

671
00:21:08,459 --> 00:21:09,960
Ahh.

672
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,421
She always does that.

673
00:21:12,421 --> 00:21:15,591
Uh, I will personally

674
00:21:12,421 --> 00:21:15,591
get some ice for that foot,

675
00:21:15,591 --> 00:21:20,804
and I'll be with you

676
00:21:15,591 --> 00:21:20,804
as quickly as I possibly can.

677
00:21:20,804 --> 00:21:22,848
An accident.

678
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:25,434
Of course.

679
00:21:25,434 --> 00:21:29,605
She's training to be

680
00:21:25,434 --> 00:21:29,605
a flamenco dancer.

681
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:36,778
Would you care to explain

682
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:36,778
what was going on out there?

683
00:21:36,778 --> 00:21:38,280
Sorry.

684
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,617
I, uh, have met Lord Nicholas.

685
00:21:41,617 --> 00:21:44,370
Actually, yep,

686
00:21:41,617 --> 00:21:44,370
at the ball. Mm-hmm.

687
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:47,665
Didn't know who he was,

688
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:47,665
so, you know, we...

689
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:47,665
we danced,

690
00:21:47,665 --> 00:21:50,709
and I flirted.

691
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,878
I feel so stupid right now.

692
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:54,880
I see.

693
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:54,880
Well, as your queen,

694
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,466
I absolutely

695
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,466
cannot condone it.

696
00:21:57,466 --> 00:22:00,760
As a grandma, I say...

697
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,389
right on.

698
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:07,351
Now, if you'll come with me,

699
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:07,351
I have something to show you.

700
00:22:07,351 --> 00:22:08,686
Oh, OK.

701
00:22:08,686 --> 00:22:12,523
I think you could

702
00:22:08,686 --> 00:22:12,523
leave that right there.

703
00:22:12,523 --> 00:22:14,900
[Queen] Thank you,

704
00:22:12,523 --> 00:22:14,900
culinary people.

705
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,485
[whispers] I'll be back.

706
00:22:16,485 --> 00:22:20,072
The renovations for your suite

707
00:22:16,485 --> 00:22:20,072
are finally finished.

708
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:22,824
Should have been ready for you

709
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:22,824
when you arrived,

710
00:22:22,824 --> 00:22:26,286
but unfortunately

711
00:22:22,824 --> 00:22:26,286
we asked Rupert's cousin

712
00:22:26,286 --> 00:22:28,038
to do the bathroom.

713
00:22:28,038 --> 00:22:29,665
It's a good lesson.

714
00:22:29,665 --> 00:22:33,960
Nepotism belongs in the arts,

715
00:22:29,665 --> 00:22:33,960
not in plumbing.

716
00:22:37,548 --> 00:22:40,509
This is your very own suite.

717
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:42,678
-Are you serious?

718
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:42,678
-Mm-hmm.

719
00:22:42,678 --> 00:22:45,138
This is... Ah!

720
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:48,392
Wow.

721
00:22:48,392 --> 00:22:50,436
This is my room?

722
00:22:50,436 --> 00:22:52,605
[chuckles] Yes.

723
00:22:52,605 --> 00:22:54,732
Oh, Grandma.

Ha-ha!

00:23:06,744 --> 00:23:08,954
We just made the bed.

728
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:11,624
This so cool!

00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:14,209
Ah, Fat Louie.

731
00:23:14,209 --> 00:23:17,379
I think he rather likes

732
00:23:14,209 --> 00:23:17,379
his new abode as well.

739
00:23:34,563 --> 00:23:36,440
OK.

740
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,985
I have my own mall.

00:29:42,973 --> 00:29:47,769
be lucky for us, maybe.

971
00:29:50,897 --> 00:29:52,190
Do I have to

972
00:29:50,897 --> 00:29:52,190
put it on myself?

973
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,358
No, I can do that.

974
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:56,903
-OK.

975
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:56,903
-Yes.

976
00:29:58,613 --> 00:30:02,492
Oh, my goodness!

977
00:29:58,613 --> 00:30:02,492
It was a ring.

978
00:30:02,492 --> 00:30:05,912
A royal proposal

979
00:30:02,492 --> 00:30:05,912
has been made.

980
00:30:07,747 --> 00:30:09,666
-Fly the lovebirds.

983
00:30:11,751 --> 00:30:12,669
You ready?

984
00:30:12,669 --> 00:30:14,087
If you are.

986
00:30:14,087 --> 00:30:17,256
the royal engagement

987
00:30:17,256 --> 00:30:18,466
of Princess Mia

988
00:30:18,466 --> 00:30:22,095
and Andrew Jacoby,

989
00:30:18,466 --> 00:30:22,095
Duke of Kenilworth.

990
00:30:22,095 --> 00:30:24,723
[crowd cheering]

991
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:39,988
Yeah, just like

992
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:39,988
the princess.

993
00:30:54,669 --> 00:30:57,047
[Nicholas]<i> Uncle, I hate to say</i>

994
00:30:54,669 --> 00:30:57,047
<i>this, but you were wrong.</i>

995
00:30:57,047 --> 00:31:00,550
Princess Mia has managed

996
00:30:57,047 --> 00:31:00,550
to find a husband

997
00:30:57,047 --> 00:31:00,550
within a week.

998
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,552
Mia cannot possibly be happy

999
00:31:02,552 --> 00:31:05,471
with the idea

1000
00:31:02,552 --> 00:31:05,471
of an arranged marriage.

1001
00:31:05,471 --> 00:31:08,850
Your task is to romance her,

1002
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:12,062
show her what

1003
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:12,062
a real relationship

1004
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:12,062
could be like,

1005
00:31:12,062 --> 00:31:16,649
a relationship filled

1006
00:31:12,062 --> 00:31:16,649
with heat and passion.

1007
00:31:16,649 --> 00:31:19,027
And change her mind

1008
00:31:16,649 --> 00:31:19,027
about Andrew?

1009
00:31:19,027 --> 00:31:20,820
Exactly.

1010
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:24,574
And the 30-day deadline expires

1011
00:31:24,574 --> 00:31:26,243
and the throne is ours.

1012
00:31:26,243 --> 00:31:28,703
And you're sure

1013
00:31:26,243 --> 00:31:28,703
my father wanted this?

1014
00:31:28,703 --> 00:31:31,081
It was his dearest wish.

1015
00:31:31,081 --> 00:31:34,751
His last words to me were,

1016
00:31:31,081 --> 00:31:34,751
"Help him, Arthur.

1017
00:31:34,751 --> 00:31:36,920
One day, he could be king."

1018
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:40,799
I don't recall him

1019
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:40,799
ever mentioning that to me.

1020
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,718
Well, he wouldn't.

1021
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,718
You were only six years old

1022
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,718
when he died.

1023
00:31:43,718 --> 00:31:46,387
But you do remember

1024
00:31:43,718 --> 00:31:46,387
who he named you after,

1025
00:31:43,718 --> 00:31:46,387
don't you?

1026
00:31:46,387 --> 00:31:47,973
Yes, Grandfather Nicholas.

1027
00:31:47,973 --> 00:31:49,141
No, no, no, no!

1029

Power, my boy,

1030
00:31:52,102 --> 00:31:55,272
means never having

1031
00:31:52,102 --> 00:31:55,272
to say you're sorry.

1032
00:31:55,272 --> 00:31:56,397
[Fat Louie yowls]

00:31:58,357 --> 00:32:02,279
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

1035
00:31:58,357 --> 00:32:02,279
Come here, kitty, kitty.

1036
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:04,948
Yes. Thank you.

1037
00:32:04,948 --> 00:32:05,991
Thank you.

1038
00:32:05,991 --> 00:32:08,534
-Oh! Your Highness.

1039
00:32:05,991 --> 00:32:08,534
-Shh.

1040
00:32:08,534 --> 00:32:10,369
[softly] Andrew's plane

1041
00:32:08,534 --> 00:32:10,369
just took off.

1042
00:32:10,369 --> 00:32:12,580
He said he'd call

1043
00:32:10,369 --> 00:32:12,580
as soon as he arrives

1044
00:32:10,369 --> 00:32:12,580
in London.

1045
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:15,333
He won't be gone long.

1046
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:15,333
Why are we whispering?

1047
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:18,295
[whispering] I'm hiding

1048
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:18,295
from my lady's maids.

1049
00:32:18,295 --> 00:32:20,755
But I'm fine, I'm fine.

1050
00:32:26,427 --> 00:32:27,553

[whistling]

1052
00:32:35,394 --> 00:32:36,980
Are you having second thoughts?

1053
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,857
No. Actually,

1054
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,857
on the contrary,

1055
00:32:38,857 --> 00:32:40,733
I was just admiring

1056
00:32:38,857 --> 00:32:40,733
my ring.

1057
00:32:40,733 --> 00:32:42,861
It was Andrew's

1058
00:32:40,733 --> 00:32:42,861
grandmother's.

1059
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:45,905
You know, he really is

1060
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:45,905
so romantic.

1061
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:49,450
Well, if you'll

1062
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:49,450
excuse me,

1063
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:53,121
I really must go see

1064
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:53,121
to some wedding details.

1065
00:32:56,499 --> 00:32:58,835
I'm sorry. Is there something

1066
00:32:56,499 --> 00:32:58,835
you wanted to say to me?

1067
00:32:58,835 --> 00:33:00,545
No. No.

1068
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:03,340
You are the one

1069
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:03,340
who stomped on me

1070
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:03,340
with your big feet.

1071
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,883
Big feet?

1072
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:07,677

1073
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:07,677
I found her!

Uh, B-B-Brigitta,

1075
00:33:07,677 --> 00:33:11,723
I'm not here.

1076
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:14,184
It wasn't her.

1077
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:14,184
It was a ghost.

1078
00:33:14,184 --> 00:33:15,434
Whoo!

1079
00:33:15,434 --> 00:33:16,477
Well, you know,

1080
00:33:16,477 --> 00:33:18,437
you danced

1081
00:33:16,477 --> 00:33:18,437
with my big feet.

1082
00:33:18,437 --> 00:33:20,315
Fine.

1083
00:33:18,437 --> 00:33:20,315
I danced with you.

1084
00:33:20,315 --> 00:33:22,775
Call the Hague, convene

1085
00:33:20,315 --> 00:33:22,775
the war crimes tribunal.

1086
00:33:22,775 --> 00:33:25,611
Mia, I would remind you

1087
00:33:22,775 --> 00:33:25,611
that we only danced

1088
00:33:22,775 --> 00:33:25,611
for about a minute.

1089
00:33:26,487 --> 00:33:29,032
It was more than a minute.

1090
00:33:29,032 --> 00:33:31,826
Well, maybe a minute

1091
00:33:29,032 --> 00:33:31,826
and a half.

1092
00:33:31,826 --> 00:33:35,872
Fine. It was

1093
00:33:31,826 --> 00:33:35,872
a minute and a half,

1094
00:33:31,826 --> 00:33:35,872
but it was also a lie,

1095
00:33:35,872 --> 00:33:39,542
because you didn't tell me

1096
00:33:35,872 --> 00:33:39,542
who you were and that you

1097
00:33:35,872 --> 00:33:39,542
were trying to steal my crown.

1098
00:33:39,542 --> 00:33:40,752
Well, please pardon me.

1099
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:42,754
I had a momentary lapse

1100
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:42,754
of good manners.

1101
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:44,756
You see, usually when

1102
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:44,756
I ask a woman to dance,

1103
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:46,716
I always show her

1104
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:46,716
my family tree.

1105
00:33:46,716 --> 00:33:49,928
Oh, well, aren't you

1106
00:33:46,716 --> 00:33:49,928
just... crafty.

1107
00:33:49,928 --> 00:33:52,097
[Mrs. Cout] Let's look

1108
00:33:49,928 --> 00:33:52,097
in the ballroom.

1109
00:33:52,097 --> 00:33:54,557
[Brigitta] The ballroom?

1110
00:33:52,097 --> 00:33:54,557
I don't think...

1111
00:33:54,557 --> 00:33:57,977
Do you want to know what else

1112
00:33:54,557 --> 00:33:57,977
you were doing while you were

1113
00:33:54,557 --> 00:33:57,977
doing your little lie dance?

1114
00:33:57,977 --> 00:33:59,271
Lie dance?

1115
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:00,772
Oh. Yeah, that is exactly

1116
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:00,772
what you did.

1117
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:02,357
What is a lie dance?

1118
00:34:02,357 --> 00:34:04,401
[Mrs. Cout] I'll go

1119
00:34:02,357 --> 00:34:04,401
to the ballroom myself.

1120
00:34:04,401 --> 00:34:06,569
[Brigitta] All right.

1121
00:34:06,569 --> 00:34:09,155
[clears throat]

1122
00:34:09,155 --> 00:34:11,199
The lie dance

1123
00:34:09,155 --> 00:34:11,199
is not the point.

1124
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,825
-The point...

1125
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,825
-What is the point?

1126
00:34:12,825 --> 00:34:14,869
is that I--

1127
00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:16,913
The point is

1128
00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:16,913
that I'm onto you.

1129
00:34:16,913 --> 00:34:19,916
Oh, boy, am I onto

1130
00:34:16,913 --> 00:34:19,916
what you are trying to do.

1131
00:34:19,916 --> 00:34:21,751
And what am I

1132
00:34:19,916 --> 00:34:21,751
trying to do?

1133
00:34:21,751 --> 00:34:24,254
I think we both know

1134
00:34:21,751 --> 00:34:24,254
exactly what that is.

1135
00:34:24,254 --> 00:34:26,298
Oh, oh, please forgive

1136
00:34:24,254 --> 00:34:26,298
the intrusion,

1137
00:34:26,298 --> 00:34:30,176
-Your Highness,

1138
00:34:26,298 --> 00:34:30,176
Lord Devereaux.

1139
00:34:26,298 --> 00:34:30,176
-No, you don't... uh...

1140
00:34:30,176 --> 00:34:33,554
[Joe] I'm told

1141
00:34:30,176 --> 00:34:33,554
this Lord Devereaux boy

1142
00:34:30,176 --> 00:34:33,554
is a native Genovian,

1143
00:34:33,554 --> 00:34:35,556
recently graduated

1144

plays polo and rugby,

1147
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:41,229
and is known as

1148
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:41,229
quite the ladies' man.

1149
00:34:41,229 --> 00:34:45,275
-She was in a closet?

1150
00:34:41,229 --> 00:34:45,275
-With him, yes.

1151
00:34:45,275 --> 00:34:47,902
[sighs] Does she have

1152
00:34:45,275 --> 00:34:47,902
the makings of a queen?

1153
00:34:47,902 --> 00:34:51,281
Well, she's young,

1154
00:34:47,902 --> 00:34:51,281
but I've always

1155
00:34:47,902 --> 00:34:51,281
believed in her.

1156
00:34:51,281 --> 00:34:53,866
-The wedding invitations

1157
00:34:51,281 --> 00:34:53,866
have been sent out.

1158
00:34:51,281 --> 00:34:53,866
-Yes.

1159
00:34:53,866 --> 00:34:56,577

00:39:46,075 --> 00:39:49,078
<i>The whole court</i>

1349
00:39:46,075 --> 00:39:49,078
<i>will be watching,</i>

1350
00:39:46,075 --> 00:39:49,078
<i>plus the troops,</i>

1351
00:39:49,078 --> 00:39:52,290
<i>and I'm wearing</i>

1352
00:39:49,078 --> 00:39:52,290
<i>a floor-length dress.</i>

1353
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:55,668
<i>I also have to be ladylike</i>

1354
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:55,668
<i>while riding sidesaddle.</i>

1355
00:39:55,668 --> 00:39:56,711
<i>Ha!</i>

1356
00:39:56,711 --> 00:39:58,671
I can't ride

1357
00:39:56,711 --> 00:39:58,671
sidesaddle.

1358
00:39:58,671 --> 00:40:01,382
No, no, no, I couldn't

1359
00:39:58,671 --> 00:40:01,382
ride sidesaddle, either,

1360
00:39:58,671 --> 00:40:01,382
when I was your age,

1361
00:40:01,382 --> 00:40:04,302
and frankly, dear,

1362
00:40:01,382 --> 00:40:04,302
it is acutely uncomfortable.

1363
00:40:04,302 --> 00:40:06,429
Herbie is

1364
00:40:04,302 --> 00:40:06,429
my riding companion.

1365
00:40:06,429 --> 00:40:09,014
-Here he is.

1366
00:40:06,429 --> 00:40:09,014
-Oh.

1367
00:40:09,014 --> 00:40:10,475
Herbie.

1368
00:40:13,894 --> 00:40:15,480
It's a wooden leg.

1369
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,981
Yes.

1370
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:20,318
That is impressively

1371
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:20,318
sneaky, Grandma.

1372
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:22,861
Did you come up with this

1373
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:22,861
on your own?

1374
00:40:22,861 --> 00:40:24,530
Oh, no, it's

1375
00:40:22,861 --> 00:40:24,530
a centuries-old idea.

1376
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:28,284
-And you put the riding boot

1377
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:28,284
on it...

1378
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:28,284
-Exactly.

1379
00:40:28,284 --> 00:40:30,286
Our ancestors knew

1380
00:40:28,284 --> 00:40:30,286
a thing or two, right?

1381
00:40:30,286 --> 00:40:34,248
You just drape your skirt

1382
00:40:30,286 --> 00:40:34,248
over it, and nobody

1383
00:40:30,286 --> 00:40:34,248
suspects a thing.

1384
00:40:34,248 --> 00:40:35,833
[Majordomo] Hear ye, hear ye.

1385
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:39,545
Princess Amelia Mignonette

1386
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:39,545
Thermopolis Renaldi

1387
00:40:39,545 --> 00:40:42,465
reviews the royal guard

1388
00:40:39,545 --> 00:40:42,465
of Genovia.

1389
00:40:42,465 --> 00:40:44,550
Now, the last time

1390
00:40:42,465 --> 00:40:44,550
we spoke,

1391
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:49,555
you mentioned that, uh,

1392
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:49,555
Princess Mia's horse, Sandy,

1393
00:40:49,555 --> 00:40:51,766
gets easily spooked

1394
00:40:49,555 --> 00:40:51,766
by snakes,

1395
00:40:51,766 --> 00:40:55,311
so let's get it

1396
00:40:51,766 --> 00:40:55,311
really spooked, shall we?

1397
00:40:55,311 --> 00:40:56,979
This is a fake snake.

1398
00:40:56,979 --> 00:40:59,774
Oh, you're very observant,

1399
00:40:56,979 --> 00:40:59,774
a regular David Attenborough.

1400
00:40:59,774 --> 00:41:02,234
That's rubber, yes,

1401
00:40:59,774 --> 00:41:02,234
but it will spook the horse.

1402
00:41:02,234 --> 00:41:05,571
I'm Nick,

1403
00:41:02,234 --> 00:41:05,571
Viscount Mabrey's nephew.

1404
00:41:05,571 --> 00:41:08,407
Aha, the chap who's trying

1405
00:41:05,571 --> 00:41:08,407
to stage the palace coup.

1406
00:41:08,407 --> 00:41:10,576
I'm Andrew Jacoby.

1407
00:41:08,407 --> 00:41:10,576
Nice to meet you.

1408
00:41:10,576 --> 00:41:13,871
Lilly Moscovitz,

1409
00:41:10,576 --> 00:41:13,871
official best friend

1410
00:41:10,576 --> 00:41:13,871
of future queen.

1411
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:15,790
I don't like you.

1412
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:17,333
Pleasure.

1413
00:41:17,333 --> 00:41:20,085
Attend. Hut!

1414
00:41:21,587 --> 00:41:23,964
I like all these men

1415
00:41:21,587 --> 00:41:23,964
wearing helmets.

1416
00:41:23,964 --> 00:41:25,424
Open rank.

1417
00:41:25,424 --> 00:41:27,385

[Sandy neighing]

1419
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:52,034
Sandy, whoa. Oh!

1420
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:52,034
Oh! Ohh!

1421
00:41:52,034 --> 00:41:53,619
-My goodness. Oh, my...

1422
00:41:52,034 --> 00:41:53,619
-Easy.

1423
00:41:53,619 --> 00:41:54,746
-Princess.

1424
00:41:53,619 --> 00:41:54,746
-Sandy, easy.

1425
00:41:54,746 --> 00:41:57,498
-Oh!

1426
00:41:54,746 --> 00:41:57,498
-Princess. Princes.

1427
00:41:57,498 --> 00:41:59,792
It's OK, Princess.

1428
00:41:57,498 --> 00:41:59,792
I'm here.

1429
00:41:59,792 --> 00:42:00,877
[crowd murmuring]

1430
00:42:00,877 --> 00:42:02,879
Joe!

1431
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:04,129
No wonder she's so clumsy.

1432
00:42:04,129 --> 00:42:06,257
She's got a wooden leg.

1433
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:09,385
[laughter]

1434
00:42:09,385 --> 00:42:11,387
[Sandy neighs]

1435
00:42:11,387 --> 00:42:13,639
Talk about getting off

1436
00:42:11,387 --> 00:42:13,639
on the wrong foot.

1437
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:18,561
[Majordomo] The ceremony

1438
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:18,561
has officially ended.

1439
00:42:18,561 --> 00:42:20,979
[bangs staff]

1440
00:42:30,155 --> 00:42:34,243
[crying]

1441
00:42:34,243 --> 00:42:36,287
You shouldn't hide.

1442
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:40,082
It only makes them

1443
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:40,082
gossip more.

1444
00:42:40,082 --> 00:42:44,253
What do you want?

1445
00:42:44,253 --> 00:42:45,797
Why, just think, Mia.

1446
00:42:45,797 --> 00:42:47,840
One more leg, and, uh,

1447
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,551
you could have easily

1448
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,551
outrun your horse.

1449
00:42:50,551 --> 00:42:54,138
I don't need this right now.

1450
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:59,310
Mia, I... I'm sorry. I...

1451
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:01,353
[Mia] No, you're not.

1452
00:43:01,353 --> 00:43:04,565
You never think about

1453
00:43:01,353 --> 00:43:04,565
anyone but yourself,

1454
00:43:01,353 --> 00:43:04,565
so just this once,

1455
00:43:04,565 --> 00:43:06,567
can you please

1456
00:43:04,565 --> 00:43:06,567
let me be miserable

1457
00:43:06,567 --> 00:43:08,986
and not make me feel worse

1458
00:43:06,567 --> 00:43:08,986
about myself?

1459
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:12,281
-Just go away.

1460
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:12,281
Go away from me.

1461
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:12,281
-Mia.

1462
00:43:12,281 --> 00:43:14,617
Princess, excuse me.

1463
00:43:14,617 --> 00:43:17,161
The queen has arrived.

1464
00:43:18,454 --> 00:43:20,289
Yes.

1465
00:43:25,544 --> 00:43:30,591
Nicholas, am I going to be

1466
00:43:25,544 --> 00:43:30,591
disappointed in you?

1467
00:43:30,591 --> 00:43:32,217
[footsteps]

1468
00:43:32,217 --> 00:43:34,929
Unfortunate incident, that.

1469
00:43:34,929 --> 00:43:37,932
I'm just leaving.

1470
00:43:34,929 --> 00:43:37,932
You going to come

1471
00:43:34,929 --> 00:43:37,932
and see me off?

1472
00:43:37,932 --> 00:43:42,269
I'd like to speak

1473
00:43:37,932 --> 00:43:42,269
with your uncle alone,

1474
00:43:37,932 --> 00:43:42,269
Nicholas, please.

1475
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:52,237
Viscount, you may not be aware

1476
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:52,237
of what my job entails

1477
00:43:52,237 --> 00:43:53,698
as the royal head of security.

1478
00:43:53,698 --> 00:43:55,741
My job is to protect the crown,

1479
00:43:55,741 --> 00:43:58,494
to make sure no harm comes

1480
00:43:55,741 --> 00:43:58,494
to the crown,

1481
00:43:58,494 --> 00:44:02,331
to step in when someone toys

1482
00:43:58,494 --> 00:44:02,331
with the crown's emotions,

1483
00:43:58,494 --> 00:44:02,331
you see.

1484
00:44:02,331 --> 00:44:04,583
I think the entire country

1485
00:44:02,331 --> 00:44:04,583
understands

1486
00:44:04,583 --> 00:44:08,170
how well you cater

1487
00:44:04,583 --> 00:44:08,170
for the crown's emotions.

1488
00:44:11,131 --> 00:44:13,342
If you hurt my girl,

1489
00:44:13,342 --> 00:44:15,761
you will answer directly to me,

1490
00:44:15,761 --> 00:44:18,848
and whatever crimes I commit

1491
00:44:15,761 --> 00:44:18,848
against you, remember,

1492
00:44:18,848 --> 00:44:22,518
I have diplomatic immunity

1493
00:44:18,848 --> 00:44:22,518
in 46 countries,

1494
00:44:22,518 --> 00:44:24,436
including Puerto Rico.

1495
00:44:24,436 --> 00:44:26,689
Sir, you will find

1496
00:44:24,436 --> 00:44:26,689
that the word "fear"

1497
00:44:26,689 --> 00:44:28,399
is not in my vocabulary.

1498
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:32,194
Perhaps...

1499
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:32,194
but it's in your eyes.

1500
00:44:36,699 --> 00:44:38,993
You forgot something.

1501
00:44:40,327 --> 00:44:42,914
<i>Au revoir, Pierre.</i>

1502
00:44:40,327 --> 00:44:42,914
<i>Remercie beaucoup.</i>

1503
00:44:42,914 --> 00:44:44,415
<i>Tres bien,</i> Majesty.

1504
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:48,126
Nicholas, I... I want

1505
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:48,126
to ask you a question.

1506
00:44:48,126 --> 00:44:50,462
Of course, Majesty.

1507
00:44:50,462 --> 00:44:55,426
Why are you so against

1508
00:44:50,462 --> 00:44:55,426
Princess Mia being queen?

1509
00:44:55,426 --> 00:44:58,470
My uncle feels

1510
00:44:55,426 --> 00:44:58,470
that Princess Mia

1511
00:44:55,426 --> 00:44:58,470
doesn't know the people.

1512
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:01,097
And you feel you do?

1513
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:01,097
Know the people?

1514
00:45:01,097 --> 00:45:04,226
Yes. I was born here,

1515
00:45:01,097 --> 00:45:04,226
I went to primary school here.

1516
00:45:04,226 --> 00:45:06,020
I am a true Genovian.

1517
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:08,940
Mia didn't even know

1518
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:08,940
she was Genovian

1519
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:08,940
until high school,

1520
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,859
and to be frank, she's spent

1521
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,859
little time here since then.

1522
00:45:11,859 --> 00:45:14,110
Well, I happen to feel

1523
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:16,321
that she'll make a great ruler.

1524
00:45:16,321 --> 00:45:20,284
She's terribly bright,

1525
00:45:16,321 --> 00:45:20,284
sensitive, caring.

1526
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:23,161
-I know that.

1527
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:23,161
-You do?

1528
00:45:23,161 --> 00:45:25,623
Yes. Yes, I do,

1529
00:45:25,623 --> 00:45:27,708
but, well, how can one

1530
00:45:25,623 --> 00:45:27,708
rule the people

1531
00:45:27,708 --> 00:45:29,710
if they do not know

1532
00:45:27,708 --> 00:45:29,710
the people?

1533
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:33,380
Touché. That's

1534
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:33,380
a very good question.

to make me like you

1699
00:50:17,164 --> 00:50:19,208

to marry Andrew

1701
00:50:19,208 --> 00:50:21,252

I'll be two seconds, Mia.

[Queen] When are you going to

1732
00:51:19,393 --> 00:51:24,231
start acting responsibly?

00:51:34,241 --> 00:51:36,910
Do you think I plan for

1740

this kind of stuff to happen?

1741
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:39,121
I lost it.

1742
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:39,121
Sometimes you just lose it!

1743
00:51:39,121 --> 00:51:42,082
You can't afford to lose it.

1744
00:51:39,121 --> 00:51:42,082
Other people lose it.

1745

We're supposed to find it.

that concept?

1751

The concept is grasped.

1752
00:51:52,968 --> 00:51:56,430
The execution is...

1753
00:51:52,968 --> 00:51:56,430
a little elusive.

1754
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:58,682

1916
00:56:32,289 --> 00:56:35,791
you have to believe

1917
00:56:32,289 --> 00:56:35,791
that you're a princess.

1918
00:56:35,791 --> 00:56:39,421
You've gotta walk the way

1919
00:56:35,791 --> 00:56:39,421
you think a princess would walk,

1920
00:56:39,421 --> 00:56:40,464
so think tall.

1921
00:56:40,464 --> 00:56:43,007
You've gotta smile and wave

1922
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:44,259
and just have fun.

1923
00:56:44,259 --> 00:56:45,218
So, are you ready?

1924
00:56:45,218 --> 00:56:46,886
[all] Yes!

1925
00:56:46,886 --> 00:56:50,223
She's letting the children

1926
00:56:46,886 --> 00:56:50,223
join her. How charming.

1927
00:56:50,223 --> 00:56:51,642
Not for everyone.

1928
00:56:51,642 --> 00:56:53,518
Drumroll, please.

1929
00:56:53,518 --> 00:56:56,062

[Mia] And so, gentlemen,

1967
00:57:59,793 --> 00:58:03,087
the children from the shelter

1968
00:58:03,087 --> 00:58:05,131
will be housed

1969
00:58:03,087 --> 00:58:05,131
at the winter castle

1970
00:58:05,131 --> 00:58:08,259
in the mountains of Libbet.

1971
00:58:08,259 --> 00:58:10,428
The use of the castle

1972
00:58:08,259 --> 00:58:10,428
as a resort

1973
00:58:10,428 --> 00:58:14,391
is sort of a perk

1974
00:58:10,428 --> 00:58:14,391
for Parliament members

1975
00:58:10,428 --> 00:58:14,391
and dignitaries.

1976
00:58:14,391 --> 00:58:16,434
-Exactly.

1977
00:58:14,391 --> 00:58:16,434
-Ah.

1978
00:58:16,434 --> 00:58:18,269
Well, I'm going to de-perk it

1979
00:58:18,269 --> 00:58:20,313
and convert it

1980
00:58:18,269 --> 00:58:20,313
into a children's shelter

1981
00:58:20,313 --> 00:58:22,482
until money can be raised

1982
00:58:20,313 --> 00:58:22,482

1983
00:58:22,482 --> 00:58:25,527

1984
00:58:22,482 --> 00:58:25,527

1987
00:58:26,862 --> 00:58:29,573
Lord Crawley,

1988
00:58:26,862 --> 00:58:29,573
how is your brother doing?

1989
00:58:29,573 --> 00:58:31,491
I don't speak

1990
00:58:29,573 --> 00:58:31,491
to my brother.

1991
00:58:31,491 --> 00:58:35,495
Oh. Well, I've hired him

1992
00:58:31,491 --> 00:58:35,495
to be the architect

1993
00:58:31,491 --> 00:58:35,495
on the project.

-Dean.

1999
00:58:43,378 --> 00:58:46,130
[Mr. Crawley] I look forward

2000
00:58:43,378 --> 00:58:46,130
to getting your notes

2001
00:58:43,378 --> 00:58:46,130
on these plans,

2002
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:47,758
but no one else's.

2003
00:58:47,758 --> 00:58:49,551
-Oh, I'll give you notes...

2004
00:58:47,758 --> 00:58:49,551
-Oh, no, you won't.

2005
00:58:49,551 --> 00:58:51,261
-I'm an architect..

2006
00:58:49,551 --> 00:58:51,261
-I am part of this Parliament...

2007
00:58:51,261 --> 00:58:54,180
-You just go skiing.

-You're a couch potato.

2011
00:58:55,432 --> 00:58:56,683
-Outdoorsman.

2012
00:58:55,432 --> 00:58:56,683
-Couch potato.

2013
00:58:56,683 --> 00:58:57,726
-Outdoorsman.

2014
00:58:56,683 --> 00:58:57,726
-Couch potato...

2017
00:59:00,019 --> 00:59:01,479
of the plan,

2018
00:59:01,479 --> 00:59:04,023
and I intend

2019
00:59:01,479 --> 00:59:04,023
to see it through.

2020

2021
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:07,360

2022
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:07,360
it'll take too long

2023
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:10,071
to raise the money,

2024
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:10,071
do you?

2025
00:59:10,071 --> 00:59:12,407
We're setting up the ramp

2027
00:59:12,407 --> 00:59:14,618
OK.

-Hello.

2029
00:59:14,618 --> 00:59:15,786
-Hello.

2030
00:59:15,786 --> 00:59:17,704
My hello is insignificant.

2031
00:59:17,704 --> 00:59:19,748
Um, Rosencrantz,

So... are you crashing

2036
00:59:27,088 --> 00:59:28,465
Sadly, no.

2037
00:59:28,465 --> 00:59:30,884
I wanted to tell you

2038
00:59:28,465 --> 00:59:30,884
that I was very impressed

2039
00:59:30,884 --> 00:59:33,511
by what you did at the parade.

2040
00:59:33,511 --> 00:59:35,346
Thank you.

01:20:02,865 --> 01:20:05,993
<i>naughty princess,</i>

2663
01:20:05,993 --> 01:20:08,078
<i>or will Lord Nicholas Devereax</i>

2664
01:20:05,993 --> 01:20:08,078
<i>be the new king?</i>

2665
01:20:08,078 --> 01:20:10,873
<i>It's out of the frying pan</i>

2666
01:20:08,078 --> 01:20:10,873
<i>and into the fire</i>

2667
01:20:10,873 --> 01:20:12,207
<i>for Princess Mia.</i>

2668
01:20:12,207 --> 01:20:14,918
<i>Keep your eggs</i>

2669
01:20:12,207 --> 01:20:14,918
<i>sunny side up.</i>

2670
01:20:14,918 --> 01:20:17,629
I'd like to tell her

2671
01:20:14,918 --> 01:20:17,629
what she can do with her eggs.

2672
01:20:17,629 --> 01:20:22,342
-Lilly, could we have

2673
01:20:17,629 --> 01:20:22,342
a moment alone?

2674
01:20:17,629 --> 01:20:22,342
-Yes.

2675
01:20:32,268 --> 01:20:34,188
So?

2676
01:20:36,857 --> 01:20:39,275
I got played.

2677
01:20:41,945 --> 01:20:44,447
Uh-huh.

2678
01:20:44,447 --> 01:20:47,409
Well, the big question is,

2679
01:20:47,409 --> 01:20:50,162
do we still have a wedding?

2680
01:20:50,162 --> 01:20:53,289
Andrew, I'm so, so sorry.

2681
01:20:53,289 --> 01:20:56,334
I ju--

2682
01:20:53,289 --> 01:20:56,334
Andrew, please wait.

2683
01:20:56,334 --> 01:20:58,003
I promise you,

2684
01:20:56,334 --> 01:20:58,003
nothing happened.

2685
01:20:58,003 --> 01:21:00,296
But Mia, you still went,

2686
01:20:58,003 --> 01:21:00,296
didn't you? You went.

2687
01:21:00,296 --> 01:21:03,592
I don't think you understand.

2688
01:21:00,296 --> 01:21:03,592
I'm an extremely eligible

2689
01:21:00,296 --> 01:21:03,592
bachelor in England.

2690
01:21:03,592 --> 01:21:06,595
I really am.

2691
01:21:03,592 --> 01:21:06,595
I've got plenty of friends,

2692
01:21:06,595 --> 01:21:09,139
lots of lovely

2693
01:21:06,595 --> 01:21:09,139
women friends, and...

2694
01:21:09,139 --> 01:21:12,976
I still think this marriage

2695
01:21:09,139 --> 01:21:12,976
is a good idea.

2696
01:21:14,228 --> 01:21:16,146
Mia...

2697
01:21:21,359 --> 01:21:23,820
[bleats]

2698
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:27,323
The queen would not

2699
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:27,323
approve of spying.

2700
01:21:31,494 --> 01:21:34,372
So?

2701
01:21:34,372 --> 01:21:35,540
Anything?

2702
01:21:35,540 --> 01:21:37,500
I really want to say yes,

2703
01:21:35,540 --> 01:21:37,500
but no.

2704
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:40,963
There's just...

2705
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:40,963
there's no... spark.

2706
01:21:42,256 --> 01:21:44,174
Me, too.

2707
01:21:44,174 --> 01:21:46,176
-Really?

2708
01:21:44,174 --> 01:21:46,176
-Really.

2709
01:21:46,176 --> 01:21:48,178
I mean,

2710
01:21:46,176 --> 01:21:48,178
it was pleasurable.

2711
01:21:48,178 --> 01:21:50,222
-Very.

2712
01:21:48,178 --> 01:21:50,222
-But no fireworks.

2713
01:21:50,222 --> 01:21:51,306
None.

2714
01:21:51,306 --> 01:21:54,184
Ohh. What are we gonna do?

2715
01:21:54,184 --> 01:21:55,978
We will...

2716
01:21:55,978 --> 01:21:59,355
We will figure something out.

2717
01:21:59,355 --> 01:22:01,191
Hmm.

2718
01:22:03,485 --> 01:22:05,904
Mia...

2719
01:22:10,075 --> 01:22:12,535
You chose me...

2720
01:22:17,666 --> 01:22:20,169
-No privacy.

2721
01:22:17,666 --> 01:22:20,169
-No.

2722
01:22:23,297 --> 01:22:26,424
You chose me,

2723
01:22:23,297 --> 01:22:26,424
and I accepted,

2724
01:22:26,424 --> 01:22:29,552
and a gentleman

2725
01:22:26,424 --> 01:22:29,552
never backs out

2726
01:22:26,424 --> 01:22:29,552
on his word.

2727
01:22:29,552 --> 01:22:31,054
We are going to...

2728
01:22:31,054 --> 01:22:34,557
We're going to

2729
01:22:31,054 --> 01:22:34,557
stand up in church

2730
01:22:31,054 --> 01:22:34,557
and say, "I do,"

2731
01:22:34,557 --> 01:22:36,601
and tomorrow,

2732
01:22:34,557 --> 01:22:36,601
we'll be man and wife,

2733
01:22:36,601 --> 01:22:41,273
and you are going to make

2734
01:22:36,601 --> 01:22:41,273
an amazing Queen of Genovia.

2735
01:22:44,151 --> 01:22:45,485
Thank you.

2736
01:23:00,959 --> 01:23:04,129
I'm getting married today.

2737
01:23:04,129 --> 01:23:07,257
[Queen] She's getting married

2738
01:23:04,129 --> 01:23:07,257
today, Maurice.

2739
01:23:07,257 --> 01:23:09,885
[Maurice barking]

2740
01:23:15,015 --> 01:23:18,643
Your Highness,

2741
01:23:15,015 --> 01:23:18,643
we're running very late.

2742
01:23:18,643 --> 01:23:21,313
Grandma says

2743
01:23:18,643 --> 01:23:21,313
the queen is never late.

2744
01:23:21,313 --> 01:23:22,522
Everyone else

2745
01:23:21,313 --> 01:23:22,522
is simply early.

2746
01:23:22,522 --> 01:23:25,192
Your Highness,

2747
01:23:22,522 --> 01:23:25,192
a strange woman came in

2748
01:23:25,192 --> 01:23:28,570
and said that she wanted

2749
01:23:25,192 --> 01:23:28,570
to hide in your closet,

2750
01:23:25,192 --> 01:23:28,570
so I let her.

2751
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:32,782
Well, dear, that probably

2752
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:32,782
wasn't the wisest decision

2753
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:32,782
in the...

2754
01:23:32,782 --> 01:23:35,369
Now, this is what I call

2755
01:23:32,782 --> 01:23:35,369
a closet.

2756
01:23:35,369 --> 01:23:38,496
-Mom!

2757
01:23:35,369 --> 01:23:38,496
-Oh, my darling.

2758
01:23:38,496 --> 01:23:41,375
Oh, careful.

2759
01:23:38,496 --> 01:23:41,375
We're squashing Trevor.

2760
01:23:41,375 --> 01:23:43,418
Hi, Trevor.

2761
01:23:43,418 --> 01:23:45,837
He's sleeping. Shh.

2762
01:23:45,837 --> 01:23:50,466
Oh, he is the most

2763
01:23:45,837 --> 01:23:50,466
beautiful baby brother.

2764
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:54,388
We were joking.

2765
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:54,388
We knew it was your mother.

2766
01:23:54,388 --> 01:23:56,223
Your stepfather's

2767
01:23:54,388 --> 01:23:56,223
here, too.

2768
01:23:56,223 --> 01:23:59,101
Now, I'm your mother,

2769
01:23:56,223 --> 01:23:59,101
it's your wedding day,

2770
01:23:59,101 --> 01:24:00,769
I have to say something.

2771
01:24:00,769 --> 01:24:03,397
Being married

2772
01:24:00,769 --> 01:24:03,397
is about being yourself,

2773
01:24:03,397 --> 01:24:05,565
only with someone else.

2774
01:24:06,482 --> 01:24:08,277
Thanks, Mom.

2775
01:24:08,277 --> 01:24:09,778
[knock on door]

2776
01:24:09,778 --> 01:24:11,654
[mother] How are you feeling?

2777
01:24:09,778 --> 01:24:11,654
You look beautiful.

2778
01:24:11,654 --> 01:24:16,243
Paolo is back

2779
01:24:11,654 --> 01:24:16,243
to turn a caterpillar

2780
01:24:11,654 --> 01:24:16,243
into a butterfly.

2781
01:24:16,243 --> 01:24:18,494
-Oh.

2782
01:24:16,243 --> 01:24:18,494
-There she go, butterfly.

2783
01:24:18,494 --> 01:24:19,871
-Paolo.

2784
01:24:18,494 --> 01:24:19,871
-Coat off.

2785
01:24:19,871 --> 01:24:21,957
I say "butterfly,"

2786
01:24:19,871 --> 01:24:21,957
the coat comes off.

2787
01:24:21,957 --> 01:24:24,251
<i>-Principessa.</i>

2788
01:24:21,957 --> 01:24:24,251
-Paolo.

2789
01:24:24,251 --> 01:24:26,211
You remember

2790
01:24:24,251 --> 01:24:26,211
my mother, Helen.

2791
01:24:26,211 --> 01:24:28,922
Yes, yes.

2792
01:24:26,211 --> 01:24:28,922
And the new baby.

2793
01:24:28,922 --> 01:24:31,300
All Italian men love a baby

2794
01:24:28,922 --> 01:24:31,300
except Paolo.

2795
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:34,303
You gotta get out now

2796
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:34,303
because we have to go to work.

2797
01:24:34,303 --> 01:24:37,889
Five years ago, Paolo take you

2798
01:24:34,303 --> 01:24:37,889
from that to that.

2799
01:24:37,889 --> 01:24:40,767
Today, he give you this.

2800
01:24:40,767 --> 01:24:43,895
[assistants] A wedding look

2801
01:24:40,767 --> 01:24:43,895
for the bride.

2802
01:24:47,732 --> 01:24:49,734
I look like a moose.

2803
01:24:49,734 --> 01:24:51,736
Yes, but a very cute moose.

2804
01:24:51,736 --> 01:24:55,573
Make all the boy moose

2805
01:24:51,736 --> 01:24:55,573
go, "Whaah!" Ha-ha-ha-ha.

2806
01:24:55,573 --> 01:24:57,784
I have antlers.

2807
01:24:57,784 --> 01:25:00,078
Whaah. Ha-ha-ha-ha.

2808
01:25:00,078 --> 01:25:02,414
Go!

2809
01:25:04,166 --> 01:25:06,460
Ha-ha!

2810
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:08,003
I look like a poodle.

2811
01:25:08,003 --> 01:25:12,966
That's just the way I feel.

2812
01:25:08,003 --> 01:25:12,966
Here we go again.

2813
01:25:12,966 --> 01:25:14,301
Good. Sit up.

2814
01:25:14,301 --> 01:25:17,512
She kinda does look

2815
01:25:14,301 --> 01:25:17,512
like a poodle.

2816
01:25:19,139 --> 01:25:20,682
I like it.

2817
01:25:22,267 --> 01:25:26,813
[Paolo] This time I'm so sure,

2818
01:25:22,267 --> 01:25:26,813
I use my own pictures.

2819
01:25:26,813 --> 01:25:30,359
So,<i> un, deux, trois.</i>

2820
01:25:30,359 --> 01:25:34,070
[Mabrey]<i> Gretchen,</i>

2821
01:25:30,359 --> 01:25:34,070
<i>I can't find my gloves.</i>

2822
01:25:34,070 --> 01:25:35,780
You go on.

2823
01:25:35,780 --> 01:25:38,992
I think it would be better

2824
01:25:35,780 --> 01:25:38,992
if I didn't go to the wedding.

2825
01:25:38,992 --> 01:25:41,536
My boy.

2826
01:25:41,536 --> 01:25:43,497
Don't give up so easily.

2827
01:25:43,497 --> 01:25:45,540
Come to church.

2828
01:25:43,497 --> 01:25:45,540
Sweep her off her feet.

2829
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:48,126
In a week or two,

2830
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:48,126
she'll be yours.

2831
01:25:48,126 --> 01:25:51,546
The game is over, Uncle.

2832
01:25:48,126 --> 01:25:51,546
She's going to marry Andrew.

2833
01:25:51,546 --> 01:25:52,964
Ah, you're so right.

2834
01:25:52,964 --> 01:25:54,966
Ah, well, this is

2835
01:25:52,964 --> 01:25:54,966
a disaster in the making.

2836
01:25:54,966 --> 01:25:57,511
Wouldn't miss

2837
01:25:54,966 --> 01:25:57,511
a moment of it.

2838
01:25:59,762 --> 01:26:02,974
I'll try to catch

2839
01:25:59,762 --> 01:26:02,974
the garter. Ha-ha!

2840
01:26:02,974 --> 01:26:05,685
The royal carriage approaches!

2841
01:26:05,685 --> 01:26:07,103
What did he say, Artie?

2842
01:26:07,103 --> 01:26:09,856
-The princess is coming.

2843
01:26:07,103 --> 01:26:09,856
-Showtime.

2844
01:26:10,940 --> 01:26:13,693
Suki Sanchez here

2845
01:26:10,940 --> 01:26:13,693
from the USA.

2846
01:26:13,693 --> 01:26:16,488
A long way from home,

2847
01:26:13,693 --> 01:26:16,488
but happily following

2848
01:26:16,488 --> 01:26:18,573
a story that started

2849
01:26:16,488 --> 01:26:18,573
in the streets of San Francisco

2850
01:26:18,573 --> 01:26:20,616

01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:55,344
[Elsie] The princess

3041
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:55,344
is re-entering the church.

3042
01:32:55,344 --> 01:32:57,388
She's walking down the aisle.

3043
01:32:57,388 --> 01:33:02,143
More like cantering

3044
01:32:57,388 --> 01:33:02,143
down the aisle.

3045
01:33:02,143 --> 01:33:03,478
[singing faster]

3046
01:33:07,981 --> 01:33:10,443
[singing stops]

3047
01:33:10,443 --> 01:33:12,570
Andrew, wait.

3048
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:17,450
Everyone deserves the chance

3049
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:17,450
to find true love, right?

3050
01:33:17,450 --> 01:33:18,827
Yes.

3051
01:33:18,827 --> 01:33:21,830
Including us?

3052
01:33:21,830 --> 01:33:25,541
Uh...

3053
01:33:25,541 --> 01:33:27,460
Thank you.

3054
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:29,420
Huh?

3055
01:33:29,420 --> 01:33:31,380
Well, for, uh,

3056
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:33,466
saving me from doing

3057
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:33,466
the proper thing

3058
01:33:33,466 --> 01:33:35,551
for once in my life.

3059
01:33:37,261 --> 01:33:40,640
Now all I have to do

3060
01:33:37,261 --> 01:33:40,640
is tell Mummy.

3061
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:43,309
I have to tell everyone else.

3062
01:33:43,309 --> 01:33:45,937
[both] Good luck.

3063
01:33:50,608 --> 01:33:52,861
[Mia whispers] OK.

3064
01:33:52,861 --> 01:33:55,404
[mumbling]

3065
01:33:55,404 --> 01:33:58,115
Helen...

3066
01:33:58,115 --> 01:34:00,827
Welcome.

3067
01:34:00,827 --> 01:34:03,872
A few moments ago,

3068
01:34:00,827 --> 01:34:03,872
I realized the only reason

3069
01:34:03,872 --> 01:34:06,582
I was getting married

3070
01:34:03,872 --> 01:34:06,582
was because of a law,

3071
01:34:06,582 --> 01:34:09,084
and that didn't seem

3072
01:34:06,582 --> 01:34:09,084
like a good enough reason,

3073
01:34:09,084 --> 01:34:12,839
so I won't be

3074
01:34:09,084 --> 01:34:12,839
getting married today.

3075
01:34:12,839 --> 01:34:16,592
Sit. Sit.

3076
01:34:12,839 --> 01:34:16,592
There may be a dinner.

3077
01:34:19,178 --> 01:34:23,349
My grandmother has ruled

3078
01:34:19,178 --> 01:34:23,349
without a man at her side

3079
01:34:19,178 --> 01:34:23,349
for quite some time,

3080
01:34:23,349 --> 01:34:28,813
and I think she rocks at it.

3081
01:34:28,813 --> 01:34:30,815
So, as the granddaughter

3082
01:34:28,813 --> 01:34:30,815
of Queen Clarisse

3083
01:34:30,815 --> 01:34:32,149
and King Rupert...

3084
01:34:32,149 --> 01:34:35,611
[all] King Rupert,

3085
01:34:32,149 --> 01:34:35,611
may he rest in peace.

3086
01:34:35,611 --> 01:34:38,531
...I ask the members

3087
01:34:35,611 --> 01:34:38,531
of Parliament to...

3088
01:34:38,531 --> 01:34:41,116
to think about your daughters,

3089
01:34:41,116 --> 01:34:43,703
your nieces, sisters

3090
01:34:43,703 --> 01:34:45,538
and granddaughters,

3091
01:34:45,538 --> 01:34:48,624
and ask yourselves...

3092
01:34:48,624 --> 01:34:50,418
would you force them to do

3093
01:34:50,418 --> 01:34:53,588
what you're trying

3094
01:34:50,418 --> 01:34:53,588
to make me do?

3095
01:34:55,297 --> 01:34:58,927
I believe I will be

3096
01:34:55,297 --> 01:34:58,927
a great queen.

3097
01:34:58,927 --> 01:35:01,387
<i>I understand Genovia</i>

3098
01:34:58,927 --> 01:35:01,387
<i>to be a land</i>

3099
01:35:01,387 --> 01:35:03,389
<i>that combines</i>

3100
01:35:01,387 --> 01:35:03,389
<i>the beauty of the past</i>

3101
01:35:03,389 --> 01:35:06,392
<i>with all the best hope</i>

3102
01:35:03,389 --> 01:35:06,392
<i>of the future.</i>

3103
01:35:06,392 --> 01:35:08,477
-Not now.

3104
01:35:06,392 --> 01:35:08,477
-[women] Shh!

3105
01:35:08,477 --> 01:35:10,563
I feel in my heart and soul

3106
01:35:10,563 --> 01:35:13,024
that I can rule Genovia.

3107
01:35:13,024 --> 01:35:15,068
I... I love Genovia.

3108
01:35:15,068 --> 01:35:19,072
Do you think that I would

3109
01:35:15,068 --> 01:35:19,072
be up here in a wedding dress

3110
01:35:15,068 --> 01:35:19,072
if I didn't?

3111
01:35:19,072 --> 01:35:21,074
[laughter]

3112
01:35:21,074 --> 01:35:24,077
I stand here...

3113
01:35:24,077 --> 01:35:28,372
ready to take my place

3114
01:35:24,077 --> 01:35:28,372
as your queen...

3115
01:35:28,372 --> 01:35:31,250
without a husband.

3116
01:35:31,250 --> 01:35:34,211
[woman] Viva, Mia!

3117
01:35:41,469 --> 01:35:43,888
Every time...

3118
01:35:43,888 --> 01:35:48,768
Every time this charming,

3119
01:35:43,888 --> 01:35:48,768
young lady opens her mouth,

3120
01:35:48,768 --> 01:35:52,229
she demonstrates a contempt

3121
01:35:52,229 --> 01:35:54,690
for the customs of Genovia.

3122
01:35:54,690 --> 01:35:57,110
The law clearly states

3123
01:35:57,110 --> 01:36:01,906
an unmarried woman

3124
01:35:57,110 --> 01:36:01,906
cannot be queen.

3125
01:36:01,906 --> 01:36:04,450
Fortunately,

3126
01:36:04,450 --> 01:36:07,202
there is another heir.

3127
01:36:07,202 --> 01:36:08,871
No, there is not.

3128
01:36:08,871 --> 01:36:11,124
[crowd murmuring]

3129
01:36:11,124 --> 01:36:12,416
I decline.

3130
01:36:12,416 --> 01:36:14,418
I refuse to be king.

3131
01:36:14,418 --> 01:36:16,796
Ladies and gentlemen,

3132
01:36:16,796 --> 01:36:19,757
it is Princess Mia

3133
01:36:16,796 --> 01:36:19,757
who should have the crown.

3134
01:36:19,757 --> 01:36:22,927
She is bright

3135
01:36:19,757 --> 01:36:22,927
and she is caring,

3136
01:36:22,927 --> 01:36:26,388
but more importantly,

3137
01:36:22,927 --> 01:36:26,388
she has a vision,

3138
01:36:26,388 --> 01:36:28,141
one that will

3139
01:36:26,388 --> 01:36:28,141
take Genovia forward,

3140
01:36:28,141 --> 01:36:31,019
and if the Parliament

3141
01:36:28,141 --> 01:36:31,019
were astute,

3142
01:36:31,019 --> 01:36:33,104
they would name her queen.

3143
01:36:33,104 --> 01:36:34,438
Listen to her.

3144
01:36:34,438 --> 01:36:37,733
She'll lead us

3145
01:36:34,438 --> 01:36:37,733
into the 21st century.

3146
01:36:37,733 --> 01:36:39,443
And besides,

3147
01:36:39,443 --> 01:36:43,072
just think how lovely she'll

3148
01:36:39,443 --> 01:36:43,072
look on our postage stamp.

3149
01:36:43,072 --> 01:36:44,657
[laughter]

3150
01:36:44,657 --> 01:36:47,535
Lovely on a postage stamp?!

3151
01:36:47,535 --> 01:36:49,996
You would look lovely

3152
01:36:47,535 --> 01:36:49,996
on a postage stamp!

3153
01:36:49,996 --> 01:36:51,747
And don't you walk

3154
01:36:49,996 --> 01:36:51,747
away from me, sir!

3155
01:36:51,747 --> 01:36:54,583
You have a duty, sir,

3156
01:36:51,747 --> 01:36:54,583
to Genovia!

3157
01:36:56,627 --> 01:36:59,505
He's, uh,

3158
01:36:56,627 --> 01:36:59,505
he is very distressed.

3159
01:36:59,505 --> 01:37:02,800
Your duty, sir,

3160
01:36:59,505 --> 01:37:02,800
to the country,

3161
01:36:59,505 --> 01:37:02,800
to me, sir!

3162
01:37:03,885 --> 01:37:05,594
To Genovia!

3163
01:37:05,594 --> 01:37:06,846
To your father!

3164
01:37:06,846 --> 01:37:08,097
Nicholas!

3165
01:37:08,097 --> 01:37:11,559
-The door.

3166
01:37:08,097 --> 01:37:11,559
-Shut the doors, quickly.

3167
01:37:11,559 --> 01:37:13,602
Nicholas! Nicholas!

3168
01:37:13,602 --> 01:37:17,106
Nicholas, I cannot have you

3169
01:37:13,602 --> 01:37:17,106
giving all-all this up

3170
01:37:13,602 --> 01:37:17,106
just for a girl.

3171
01:37:17,106 --> 01:37:20,151
-Now-Now, we can...

3172
01:37:17,106 --> 01:37:20,151
-Enough, Uncle.

3173
01:37:20,151 --> 01:37:22,778
We're finished.

3174
01:37:24,697 --> 01:37:26,615
What is happening here?

3175
01:37:26,615 --> 01:37:29,284
Who's next in line

3176
01:37:26,615 --> 01:37:29,284
for the throne,

3177
01:37:26,615 --> 01:37:29,284
the Von Trokens?

3178
01:37:29,284 --> 01:37:30,536
We accept!

3179
01:37:30,536 --> 01:37:33,081
Sit down!

3180
01:37:35,248 --> 01:37:37,585
[coughs] Make a motion.

3181
01:37:37,585 --> 01:37:38,920
Are you OK?

3182
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:40,796
Make a motion!

3183
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:40,796
[coughs]

3184
01:37:40,796 --> 01:37:44,341
Ah, um, Prime Minister...

3185
01:37:44,341 --> 01:37:45,843
Yes, Princess?

3186
01:37:45,843 --> 01:37:49,097
I move to abolish

3187
01:37:45,843 --> 01:37:49,097
the marriage law

3188
01:37:49,097 --> 01:37:53,642
as it applies to present

3189
01:37:49,097 --> 01:37:53,642
and future queens of Genovia.

3190
01:37:53,642 --> 01:37:56,395
Will anyone second my motion?

3191
01:37:58,564 --> 01:38:00,775
Just keep

3192
01:37:58,564 --> 01:38:00,775
eye contact with them.

3193
01:38:00,775 --> 01:38:02,902
Stare them down.

3194
01:38:02,902 --> 01:38:06,864
N-N-N... soften,

3195
01:38:02,902 --> 01:38:06,864
soften. Good.

3196
01:38:12,536 --> 01:38:17,041
Ahem. I second the motion.

3197
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:22,130
It's time we had

3198
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:22,130
a new tradition.

3199
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:22,130
I like change.

3200
01:38:22,130 --> 01:38:23,714
I may grow a moustache.

3201
01:38:23,714 --> 01:38:26,092
I think you'd

3202
01:38:23,714 --> 01:38:26,092
look marvelous

3203
01:38:23,714 --> 01:38:26,092
with a moustache.

3204
01:38:26,092 --> 01:38:27,760
My father always favored

3205
01:38:26,092 --> 01:38:27,760
a Van Dyke....

3206
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:29,386
Gentlemen, please.

3207
01:38:29,386 --> 01:38:31,222
All those in favor

3208
01:38:31,222 --> 01:38:33,891
of abolishing

3209
01:38:31,222 --> 01:38:33,891
the marriage rule,

3210
01:38:33,891 --> 01:38:36,018
say, "Aye"

3211
01:38:38,938 --> 01:38:40,106
Aye.

3212
01:38:40,106 --> 01:38:42,483
Aye.

3213
01:38:42,483 --> 01:38:44,902
-Aye.

3214
01:38:42,483 --> 01:38:44,902
-Aye.

3215
01:38:44,902 --> 01:38:48,156
-You're not in Parliament.

3216
01:38:44,902 --> 01:38:48,156
Sit down.

3217
01:38:44,902 --> 01:38:48,156
-Someday.

3218
01:38:48,156 --> 01:38:50,241
[all] Aye.

3219
01:38:50,241 --> 01:38:52,868
The "ayes" have it.

3220
01:38:52,868 --> 01:38:55,663
Congratulations, Princess.

3221
01:38:55,663 --> 01:38:59,374
If I may say so myself,

3222
01:38:55,663 --> 01:38:59,374
you rule!

3223
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:11,720
Lionel...

3224
01:39:12,763 --> 01:39:15,057
Your Majesty...

3225
01:39:15,057 --> 01:39:16,184
Hmm?

3226
01:39:16,184 --> 01:39:19,728
The princess

3227
01:39:16,184 --> 01:39:19,728
would like a word.

3228
01:39:21,230 --> 01:39:23,941
Oh. Um...

3229
01:39:25,526 --> 01:39:31,240
Grandma... just because I didn't

3230
01:39:25,526 --> 01:39:31,240
