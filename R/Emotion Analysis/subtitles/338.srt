Huh?

30
00:02:07,623 --> 00:02:09,758
Oh, my God, it means:
"Cover me, go left."

31
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,926
Read the manual,
why don't you?

32
00:02:13,662 --> 00:02:15,798
Wait for my three count.

33
00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:17,967
And one, two...

34
00:02:17,968 --> 00:02:19,636
Unbelievable.

35
00:02:19,637 --> 00:02:21,303
FBI! Freeze! FBI! Hands
on top of your head!

36
00:02:21,304 --> 00:02:23,372
Don't move! Get 'em up!
Okay, calm down, okay, man?

37
00:02:23,373 --> 00:02:26,375
On your head! Hey,
calm down, tough guy.

38
00:02:26,376 --> 00:02:28,211
Surprise.

39
00:02:28,212 --> 00:02:29,846
We've checked everywhere.

40
00:02:29,847 --> 00:02:31,114
There's nothing.

41
00:02:31,115 --> 00:02:32,649
Well, place is clean, Ashburn.

42
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,385
Looks like your theory
has a few holes in it.

43
00:02:35,386 --> 00:02:36,652
Let's roll, boys.

44
00:02:36,653 --> 00:02:38,355
So you think it's clean, huh?

45
00:02:38,356 --> 00:02:40,223
Oh, here we go. Yeah,
that's what they...

46
00:02:40,224 --> 00:02:41,591
that's what they said last year

47
00:02:41,592 --> 00:02:42,993
right before I arrested
the Red Falls Killer.

48
00:02:42,994 --> 00:02:44,628
What are those?

49
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:46,530
Barbecue spareribs?

50
00:02:46,531 --> 00:02:48,232
Is that what that is?

51
00:02:48,233 --> 00:02:49,734
I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong.

52
00:02:49,735 --> 00:02:50,966
Or...

53
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,138
maybe I'm not.

54
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:56,841
Yeah. Airtight.

55
00:02:56,842 --> 00:02:58,042
Dipped in wax.

56
00:02:58,043 --> 00:02:59,544
I respect that.

57
00:02:59,545 --> 00:03:02,280
I especially like the
meat to distract the dog.

58
00:03:02,281 --> 00:03:03,981
And while that may have fooled

59
00:03:03,982 --> 00:03:05,751
the loudest breather
in the world,

60
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:07,285
it did not fool me.

61
00:03:07,286 --> 00:03:10,288
And, unfortunately, it's
not what I'm looking for.

62
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:12,190
So why don't we just
cut to the chase?

63
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:13,624
Are there guns in this house?

64
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,360
I don't know anything
about any guns.

65
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,529
Interesting.

66
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,364
Maybe I'm wrong. You know?

67
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,699
Mm, wait for it.

68
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,567
Maybe these guys are...
are right for a change.

69
00:03:22,568 --> 00:03:24,836
Stranger things have
happened, right, guys?

70
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:26,972
Mm, that's a trap.
Meteors, comets.

71
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,540
Somebody married Pete,
and he can't even

72
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,908
count to three. Uhuh.

73
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:30,842
See? Right there?

74
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:32,444
So frustrating.

75
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:34,414
You know, they
loved these houses

76
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:35,882
during the Prohibition Era.

77
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:38,517
You guys know what
prohibition is, don't you?

78
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:41,220
Yeah, selling your
ass for money?

79
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,323
Really? Really?

80
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:44,958
No. No, it was, uh, alcohol.

81
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,327
People loved to drink it, even
though they weren't supposed to,

82
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,828
and these houses had
all these little

83
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,930
nooks and crannies where
they could hide it.

84
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:52,631
Like this one.

85
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,101
Is there something behind me?

86
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:57,036
There is, isn't there?

87
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:58,538
Fuck.

88
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:00,205
Now you can roll.

89
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:02,909
Gentlemen.

90
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:05,812
Nice work, dick.

91
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,854
Jesus.

92
00:04:20,562 --> 00:04:22,295
Let's go. Ooh...

93
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,501
Hard to believe she's single.

94
00:04:32,641 --> 00:04:34,174
Oh!

95
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,650
Immediately below that, you
feel a little crease...

96
00:04:41,651 --> 00:04:43,818
Wow, that's pretty
impressive, huh?

97
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:45,920
Do you see that? Look at that.

98
00:04:45,921 --> 00:04:47,922
We'd want to make an incision
right through there.

99
00:04:47,923 --> 00:04:49,625
That's pretty amazing, huh?

100
00:04:49,626 --> 00:04:51,459
Pretty amazing.

101
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,661
Pumpkin!

102
00:04:52,662 --> 00:04:54,562
Here, kitty, kitty.

103
00:04:54,563 --> 00:04:57,065
Are you at the
neighbor's again?

104
00:04:57,066 --> 00:04:58,367
Pumpkin!

105
00:04:58,368 --> 00:05:00,569
Here, kitty, kitty.

106
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,271
Go on home.

107
00:05:02,272 --> 00:05:03,773
I'll see you tomorrow.

108
00:05:03,774 --> 00:05:05,807
There you go.

109
00:05:08,577 --> 00:05:10,346
Pumpkin, I told you

110
00:05:10,347 --> 00:05:12,213
to stay away from
that weird lady.

111
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:31,467
Yo, taxi!

112
00:05:41,112 --> 00:05:42,546
Mmhmm.

113
00:05:42,547 --> 00:05:44,581
<i>No, no, no, o lo lo...
lo siento.</i>

114
00:05:44,582 --> 00:05:46,184
<i>No, hay a poder
llegar temprano,</i>

115
00:05:46,185 --> 00:05:48,219
<i>llamar de Los vecinos
y diles que...</i>

116
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,188
<i>Lo siento. PerdÃ³n.</i>

117
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:51,588
Oh, boy.

118
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:53,423
Wife doesn't like you
working late, huh?

119
00:05:53,424 --> 00:05:55,293
What do you want?

120
00:05:55,294 --> 00:05:56,527
Oh, just, uh, letting you know

121
00:05:56,528 --> 00:05:57,962
that I have been
observing the agents,

122
00:05:57,963 --> 00:05:59,364
overseeing what
they've been up to,

123
00:05:59,365 --> 00:06:01,265
you know, keeping
an eye on them.

124
00:06:01,266 --> 00:06:02,734
Yeah. Supervising.

125
00:06:02,735 --> 00:06:04,370
Supervising. Yes, sir.

126
00:06:04,371 --> 00:06:05,971
Look, Ashburn...

127
00:06:05,972 --> 00:06:08,206
I haven't made any
decisions yet.

128
00:06:08,207 --> 00:06:09,640
Oh... of course not.

129
00:06:09,641 --> 00:06:11,542
Every... everyone
deserves a shot.

130
00:06:11,543 --> 00:06:14,346
I don't know if you are the
right person for this position.

131
00:06:14,347 --> 00:06:15,681
I'm s... I'm sorry, what?

132
00:06:15,682 --> 00:06:16,782
What? I'm confused.

133
00:06:16,783 --> 00:06:18,517
Walk with me.

134
00:06:18,518 --> 00:06:19,885
Sir, I don't... I
don't understand.

135
00:06:19,886 --> 00:06:21,686
I've closed more cases
than any agent here.

136
00:06:21,687 --> 00:06:23,155
Should I not have done that?

137
00:06:23,156 --> 00:06:24,390
You are a solid agent.

138
00:06:24,391 --> 00:06:26,291
There are many other
solid agents.

139
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:27,860
Well, none of them have closed

140
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:29,628
the Red Falls Killer case.

141
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:30,963
Ashburn, it's no secret

142
00:06:30,964 --> 00:06:33,032
that none of the other
agents like you.

143
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:34,768
What?

144
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,935
I've gotten countless
complaints of arrogance

145
00:06:36,936 --> 00:06:38,771
and competitiveness,
showmanship.

146
00:06:38,772 --> 00:06:40,339
Just give it a rest.

147
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,775
All right.

148
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,110
We've got a situation in Boston.

149
00:06:44,111 --> 00:06:47,647
The Feds picked up chatter
on a guy moving in.

150
00:06:47,648 --> 00:06:48,948
Simon Larkin.

151
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:50,718
We don't know what
he looks like,

152
00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:53,319
where he comes from, nothing.

153
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,855
We believe this guy is
doing the legwork for him.

154
00:06:55,856 --> 00:06:57,690
Julian Vincent, nasty
son of a bitch.

155
00:06:57,691 --> 00:07:01,128
Murder, extortion.

156
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,596
This is his M.O.

157
00:07:02,597 --> 00:07:04,965
The problem with guys
like that is that

158
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,766
everyone's too scared to talk.

159
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:09,002
Pack your bags. I'm
sending you to Boston.

160
00:07:09,003 --> 00:07:11,005
You know how to get
inside people's heads.

161
00:07:11,006 --> 00:07:13,107
You want to find
Larkin, get to Julian.

162
00:07:13,108 --> 00:07:16,209
You do well with this, we
can talk about the job.

Champaz? Did your Mom
give you that name?

Not exactly.

177
00:07:50,047 --> 00:07:51,746
Hey, Mullins.

178
00:07:51,747 --> 00:07:54,282
Captain wants to know
when you're coming in.

179
00:07:54,283 --> 00:07:55,617
Hey, you know what?

180
00:07:55,618 --> 00:07:57,453
Tell him I'll be there

00:07:57,454 --> 00:07:58,788
gofuckyourself o'clock.

182
00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:00,356
Okay? If there's no traffic.

183
00:08:00,357 --> 00:08:01,991
Thank you.

184
00:08:01,992 --> 00:08:03,993
That seems kind of expensive.
Expensive?

185
00:08:03,994 --> 00:08:05,929
Can you break a hundred? I
got a hundred right here.

186
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,530
No, baby, I'm not going
to break a hundred.

187
00:08:07,531 --> 00:08:08,865
All right, let me see.

188
00:08:08,866 --> 00:08:10,600
I don't think I have that.
Wow.

189
00:08:10,601 --> 00:08:12,101
My God, do you have,
like, a discount?

190
00:08:12,102 --> 00:08:13,669
Hey, what's going on here?

191
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,240
Okay, I don't want any
drugs, all right?

192
00:08:16,241 --> 00:08:17,574
Oh.

193
00:08:17,575 --> 00:08:19,476
No. Hi. How you doing?

194
00:08:19,477 --> 00:08:21,512
Are you trying to get a...
a deal on my girl here?

195
00:08:21,513 --> 00:08:23,012
Are you her pimp?

196
00:08:23,013 --> 00:08:24,548
No, we're just friends.
Isn't that right?

197
00:08:24,549 --> 00:08:26,517
Okay, well, it's... I think
this is just kind of...

198
00:08:26,518 --> 00:08:27,751
between her and I, so let's...

199
00:08:27,752 --> 00:08:29,620
Am I kind of invading
your space here?

200
00:08:29,621 --> 00:08:31,154
Kind of. I don't
want to do that.

201
00:08:31,155 --> 00:08:32,890
Let me see if this
will help you.

202
00:08:32,891 --> 00:08:35,093
All right, look, I...
I just wanted to...

203
00:08:35,094 --> 00:08:36,261
Oh.

204
00:08:36,262 --> 00:08:39,563
Well, it... it's, uh...

205
00:08:39,564 --> 00:08:42,432
it's a good thing I didn't
get the drugs from you.

206
00:08:42,433 --> 00:08:44,569
Yeah, can you imagine that?

207
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:47,272
That would have been...
That would have been crazy.

208
00:08:47,273 --> 00:08:50,174
That would have been bad.
That would have been bad.

209
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,376
Yeah, right?

210
00:08:52,377 --> 00:08:54,012
Whew!

211
00:08:54,013 --> 00:08:57,682
You'd better wipe that brow.

212
00:08:57,683 --> 00:08:59,083
Listen, um... Thanks.

213
00:08:59,084 --> 00:09:00,385
I got to ask,
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

214
00:09:00,386 --> 00:09:02,288
You know, whatever...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

215
00:09:02,289 --> 00:09:04,590
What was... what was
actually going on here?

216
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:07,258
Oh, we were just, um...

217
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:09,193
She looked kind of
sad, so I just...

218
00:09:09,194 --> 00:09:11,931
I kind of thought I'd help her
out and give her a ride home.

219
00:09:11,932 --> 00:09:13,365
That's nice, like
a Good Samaritan.

220
00:09:13,366 --> 00:09:15,067
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Were you depressed?

221
00:09:15,068 --> 00:09:16,335
Was he giving you a ride home?

222
00:09:16,336 --> 00:09:17,536
Yeah, I was kind of
cheering you up.

223
00:09:17,537 --> 00:09:19,038
Yeah, good for you.

224
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,674
You know who else is pretty sad?
Frank over here.

225
00:09:20,675 --> 00:09:23,175
Right, Frank, you get sad 'cause
you shit and piss yourself?

226
00:09:23,176 --> 00:09:24,910
You having a sad day, Frank?

227
00:09:24,911 --> 00:09:26,412
Hey, maybe you can put him
in the back of your car...

228
00:09:26,413 --> 00:09:28,881
You want to shit and piss
all over this guys car?

229
00:09:28,882 --> 00:09:30,517
You know what, let's
open up the...

230
00:09:30,518 --> 00:09:32,719
Frank, you want to shit your
pants and get in the...

231
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,087
Oh, good, it's open.

232
00:09:34,088 --> 00:09:35,255
I can put, uh, Frank in there.
Okay.

233
00:09:35,256 --> 00:09:36,456
He can shit and piss himself...
Okay.

234
00:09:36,457 --> 00:09:37,690
Until he's happy.

235
00:09:37,691 --> 00:09:38,857
I got some towels. I
can put some towels...

236
00:09:38,858 --> 00:09:40,527
Does that sounds good?
Yeah, sure.

237
00:09:40,528 --> 00:09:42,362
Why don't you let me see your I.D.
there? Oh, come on, please.

238
00:09:42,363 --> 00:09:44,230
Um... Yeah, hey, let me
just take the whole thing.

239
00:09:44,231 --> 00:09:45,932
I don't... Yeah, it's good.
It's... I got it.

240
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:46,933
Oh, good.

241
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:48,268
You know what?

242
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:49,937
I got nervous that
maybe you didn't have

243
00:09:49,938 --> 00:09:51,973
a wife and a whole
bunch of kids, but...

244
00:09:51,974 --> 00:09:53,239
but luckily, you do.

245
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,708
What's your wife's name?

246
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:55,976
Her name is Bella.

247
00:09:55,977 --> 00:09:57,844
Oh, Bella. Good.

248
00:09:57,845 --> 00:09:59,780
Hey, can I borrow your
phone for a minute?

249
00:09:59,781 --> 00:10:01,949
My... yeah, my...
my battery's out.

250
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,451
Why do you want to
borrow my phone?

251
00:10:03,452 --> 00:10:05,019
Because I asked you
for your phone.

252
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,020
Give me your fucking phone.

253
00:10:06,021 --> 00:10:07,421
Shut your mouth.

254
00:10:07,422 --> 00:10:09,457
Can't you just, like, g
give me one chance here?

255
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:10,958
Yeah, I'll give you one chance.

256
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,226
Hello?

257
00:10:12,227 --> 00:10:13,494
Yeah, who's this?
Is this Bella?

258
00:10:13,495 --> 00:10:15,162
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

259
00:10:15,163 --> 00:10:16,397
That's... Don't do that.
Don't do that.

260
00:10:16,398 --> 00:10:17,833
Ow! My God! Don't do that.

261
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:19,167
Yes, this is Officer Mullins.
God!

262
00:10:19,168 --> 00:10:20,769
I'm here with your husband.

263
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:21,770
God, what are you, Spock?

264
00:10:21,771 --> 00:10:23,270
No.

265
00:10:23,271 --> 00:10:25,139
No, he's not been in an
accident, unfortunately.

266
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,743
I just, uh... II do have him
here with a known prostitute.

267
00:10:27,744 --> 00:10:29,745
God! She's lying!

268
00:10:29,746 --> 00:10:31,013
Bella, she's lying!

269
00:10:31,014 --> 00:10:32,848
Oh, that's not the
first time, huh?

270
00:10:32,849 --> 00:10:34,549
God. Yeah, that's him.

271
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,319
He's crying 'cause I'm
breaking his fucking hand.

272
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,986
God. Oh, she said
do it harder.

273
00:10:37,987 --> 00:10:39,087
All right, Bella.

274
00:10:39,088 --> 00:10:40,455
Ow! God! That's for Bella.

275
00:10:40,456 --> 00:10:43,492
Well, you got to go with
your instincts, Bella.

276
00:10:43,493 --> 00:10:45,395
Yep, you're welcome.

277
00:10:45,396 --> 00:10:48,164
Yep, she's probably going to
burn your shit today, so...

278
00:10:48,165 --> 00:10:50,466
Come on, look, you don't
understand, all right?

279
00:10:50,467 --> 00:10:52,567
She just had a baby. There's
a lot going on down there.

280
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,269
I'm not going to touch that.
Why don't you take your, uh,

281
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,738
seat belt off for a minute?

282
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:57,006
Oh, come on, please...
come on. Yeah.

283
00:10:57,007 --> 00:10:58,474
No, you seem like
a reasonable guy.

284
00:10:58,475 --> 00:11:00,309
You look like you got...
Take your fucking belt off.

285
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,644
And you look like you
got some compassion.

286
00:11:01,645 --> 00:11:04,415
Listen, I love... I love
the sound of a guy that,

287
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:07,184
after his wife gives him
his fifth fucking child,

288
00:11:07,185 --> 00:11:09,118
complains about
her messy vagina.

289
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:11,487
And then you don't want
to fucking touch her!

290
00:11:11,488 --> 00:11:13,590
Get out of the fucking car. I
can unlock the door for you.

291
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:15,526
What the fuck, man? Get
out of the fucking car!

292
00:11:15,527 --> 00:11:17,261
Get out of the fucking car!
Are you kidding me?

293
00:11:17,262 --> 00:11:18,729
Come on! Get up
against the car.

294
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,197
What is your problem? You
asked for my phone...

295
00:11:20,198 --> 00:11:21,699
Turn around. You
want to do that?

296
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,600
Do you want to do that? It's hot!
The car is hot!

297
00:11:23,601 --> 00:11:26,536
Good! I hope it burns
your fucking dick off!

298
00:11:29,841 --> 00:11:32,711
Hey, it's Rojas, my
favorite asshole.

299
00:11:32,712 --> 00:11:34,212
Yeah, look what I found.

300
00:11:34,213 --> 00:11:35,980
Oh, no, did I take some
of your business away?

301
00:11:35,981 --> 00:11:37,581
That's a real shame.

302
00:11:37,582 --> 00:11:39,183
Lady, I don't even know
what you're talking about.

303
00:11:39,184 --> 00:11:40,417
I just stand on this corner,

304
00:11:40,418 --> 00:11:42,187
and I just do my
"sodukas," okay?

305
00:11:42,188 --> 00:11:44,289
Oh, is that right? First of
all, it's "soduko," dumb-ass.

306
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,224
And you want to
tell me that you're

307
00:11:46,225 --> 00:11:47,625
just here coincidentally,
right in the...

308
00:11:47,626 --> 00:11:49,627
right in the middle of
all the prostitutes?

309
00:11:49,628 --> 00:11:51,731
Lady, tell me this... why are
you so obsessed with me?

310
00:11:51,732 --> 00:11:53,064
You should be ashamed
of yourself,

311
00:11:53,065 --> 00:11:54,499
trying to break down a
successful black man.

312
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,667
You racist?

313
00:11:55,668 --> 00:11:58,169
And don't play that race
bullshit card with me!

314
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:00,806
Nine out of ten guys I
fuck are black guys.

315
00:12:00,807 --> 00:12:02,508
Lady, what I think
you need to do...

316
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:05,244
you need to go down the road,
take a vacation, okay?

317
00:12:05,245 --> 00:12:06,846
And go get your groove back.

318
00:12:06,847 --> 00:12:09,013
Lady, just relax, chill, okay?

319
00:12:09,014 --> 00:12:10,582
What is that?

320
00:12:13,619 --> 00:12:16,155
Take off.

321
00:12:16,156 --> 00:12:17,289
Yeah, that's what I thought.

322
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,992
I'm not a part of this!

323
00:12:18,993 --> 00:12:20,160

wrong with you?

352
00:13:31,968 --> 00:13:34,470
Bella, I'm sorry!

353
00:13:34,471 --> 00:13:36,539
Let me go! Hold still,
you piece of shit!

354
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,940
Ow! My leg, lady!

355
00:13:37,941 --> 00:13:39,141
Let me go!

356
00:13:39,142 --> 00:13:40,375
No! No!

357
00:13:40,376 --> 00:13:42,211
Lady, what the hell
is wrong with you?

358
00:13:42,212 --> 00:13:44,080
I'll tell you what the
hell's the matter with me.

359
00:13:44,081 --> 00:13:45,481
It's you, piece of shit.

360
00:13:45,482 --> 00:13:47,083
Son of a bitch.

361
00:13:47,084 --> 00:13:49,052
Stop moving!

362
00:13:49,053 --> 00:13:50,653
Leave me alone.
Leave me alone!

363
00:13:50,654 --> 00:13:51,921
Get off me! Shit.

364
00:13:51,922 --> 00:13:53,121
Get off me!

365
00:13:54,158 --> 00:13:55,958
Shit.

366
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,229
Yeah.

367
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,164
Man, lady, what the hell
did you throw at me?

368
00:14:01,165 --> 00:14:03,000
A watermelon. A watermelon?

369
00:14:03,001 --> 00:14:04,101
Ah, hell, no!

370
00:14:04,102 --> 00:14:05,836
See, I told you
you was a racist.

371
00:14:05,837 --> 00:14:07,871
Yeah? I tried to hit you with my car.
What's that make me?

372
00:14:07,872 --> 00:14:10,240
Yeah, let's see what you got in...
Oh, look at this.

373
00:14:10,241 --> 00:14:11,642
Look at this. Not
even my birthday.

374
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:13,244
Hey, man, you planted
that shit on me, man!

375
00:14:13,245 --> 00:14:14,545
Yeah, I planted it, yeah.

376
00:14:14,546 --> 00:14:16,180
You planted that on me!
I'm innocent!

377
00:14:16,181 --> 00:14:17,947
Shut up before I feed you watermelon.
Get up.

378
00:14:25,456 --> 00:14:26,423
Levy?

379
00:14:26,424 --> 00:14:27,825
Yeah. Federal Agent
Sarah Ashburn

380
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:30,262
from the New York field office.
Hi. How are you?

381
00:14:30,263 --> 00:14:31,563
I'm going to need all your files

382
00:14:31,564 --> 00:14:33,031
on all known drug
dealers of the area.

383
00:14:33,032 --> 00:14:34,599
Right. We heard you were coming.

384
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,534
Actually, I was expecting you.
Ah.

385
00:14:36,535 --> 00:14:37,935
I'll show you to your desk.
Oh, that won't be necessary.

386
00:14:37,936 --> 00:14:39,337
I won't be here long.

387
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:41,606
Okay. Okay. So I can carry these.
Thank you.

388
00:14:41,607 --> 00:14:42,840
Where is it?

389
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,878
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey! Ashburn!

390
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:48,046
Ashburn!

391
00:14:48,047 --> 00:14:49,282
Oh! Ooh. Oh, God.

392
00:14:49,283 --> 00:14:50,316
You okay? What? What is it?

393
00:14:50,317 --> 00:14:51,951
What is it? Okay.

394
00:14:51,952 --> 00:14:54,185
Lowend dealer just brought
into the East Boston precinct.

395
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:56,320
All right. Name's
Terrell Rojas.

396
00:14:57,756 --> 00:14:59,358
Oh. Oh, okay.

397
00:14:59,359 --> 00:15:00,793
Good. Thank you very much.

398
00:15:00,794 --> 00:15:02,028
Good... good luck out there.

399
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:03,562
It's not about luck, pal.

400
00:15:03,563 --> 00:15:04,896
Not about luck.

401
00:15:07,835 --> 00:15:09,268
Wow.

402
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:11,537
That was almost cool.

403
00:15:11,538 --> 00:15:13,571
Almost.

404
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:26,085
Come on, come on, come on.

405
00:15:26,086 --> 00:15:27,988
Ain't going to
fucking park today?

406
00:15:27,989 --> 00:15:29,156
All right.

407
00:15:29,157 --> 00:15:31,023
Here we go. Finally.

408
00:15:34,995 --> 00:15:36,998
Hey! I'm moving in there!

409
00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:38,498
No, don't...!

410
00:15:38,499 --> 00:15:40,634
Hey, hey, hey! No, get
back in your car.

411
00:15:40,635 --> 00:15:42,936
Hey! Hey!

412
00:15:42,937 --> 00:15:44,104
Hey, asshole!

413
00:15:44,105 --> 00:15:46,406
Goddamn it.

414
00:15:49,177 --> 00:15:50,445
FBI.

415
00:15:50,446 --> 00:15:52,180
Hey, you need to sign in.

416
00:15:52,181 --> 00:15:54,716
Come on. Let's go.

417
00:15:54,717 --> 00:15:56,683
Captain Woods?

418
00:15:58,152 --> 00:15:59,487
Captain Woods?

419
00:15:59,488 --> 00:16:01,022
Christ. I'm sorry?

420
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:03,324
Uh, how can I help you?

421
00:16:03,325 --> 00:16:04,793
Special Agent Sarah Ashburn.

422
00:16:04,794 --> 00:16:06,695
We got intel recently
that you brought in

423
00:16:06,696 --> 00:16:08,663
a dealer by the name
of Terrell Rojas.

424
00:16:08,664 --> 00:16:11,099
Uh, yeah, but Detective Mullins
isn't back from lunch yet.

425
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,667
I'm sure he won't mind.

426
00:16:12,668 --> 00:16:14,403
Well, he's a she, and we're not

427
00:16:14,404 --> 00:16:16,238
really allowed to go
near her collars.

428
00:16:16,239 --> 00:16:18,374
Let me tell you what I think.

429
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,875
I think that every second
we're standing here

430
00:16:19,876 --> 00:16:21,243
is interfering with the
federal investigation.

431
00:16:21,244 --> 00:16:22,779
So, if you'd be so kind

432
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,214
as to show Mr. Rojas to
an interrogation room.

433
00:16:25,215 --> 00:16:26,382
Thank you.

434
00:16:26,383 --> 00:16:27,983
Special Agent? Yes.

435
00:16:27,984 --> 00:16:30,185
This way. Okay.

436
00:16:30,186 --> 00:16:32,654
Special Agent? Yes.

437
00:16:35,992 --> 00:16:37,826
Special Agent?

438
00:16:51,242 --> 00:16:52,909
Shit.

439
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:57,013
You are looking at
possession with intent,

440
00:16:57,014 --> 00:17:01,886
which is a class D drug charge,
chapter 94C, section 32A.

441
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:04,288
I had a joint and a few
little bags of coke.

442
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:05,589
Since when is that shit illegal?

443
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:07,324
The answer to your
question is always.

444
00:17:07,325 --> 00:17:08,925
And with your priors,

445
00:17:08,926 --> 00:17:13,431
you are looking at 25 years
and some pretty stiff fines.

446
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,032
Who the hell cares about fines?

447
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:16,167
That's 25 years!

448
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:17,435
Never mind.

449
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:19,438
Let's see what you
make of these.

450
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,972
Huh? What do you
make of these?

451
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,308
What I make of them is
that somebody doesn't want

452
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:25,409
somebody else selling
on their turf.

453
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,811
But you're still here.

454
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:29,281
And you're alive. Why is that?

455
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:30,816
Who you working for? Nobody.

456
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:32,617
Who you working for? Who
you working for? Nobody.

457
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,453
Nobody! If I tell
you, that's my ass

458
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:36,620
chopped up into a million
motherfucking pieces!

459
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:39,790
Goddamn it.

460
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,061
Fucker.

461
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,663
God.

462
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:46,031
Push!

463
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:48,301
This motherfucker!

464
00:17:48,302 --> 00:17:50,103
Everybody's got to
fucking park in my spot.

465
00:17:50,104 --> 00:17:51,304
Goddamn it!

466
00:17:51,305 --> 00:17:52,772
Shit!

467
00:17:52,773 --> 00:17:54,306
Suitwearing, God...

468
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:55,807
Ow! Fuck!

469
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:56,942
God.

470
00:17:58,479 --> 00:17:59,645
Yeah, I said I'm...

471
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:01,080
fucking parking there.

472
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:04,382
That doesn't... Steal my
goddamn fucking space.

473
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:10,990
I don't want you to do time.

474
00:18:10,991 --> 00:18:14,360
I don't want you to get
chopped up into little, tiny,

475
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:16,163
mothereffin' pieces.

476
00:18:16,164 --> 00:18:17,331
Oh.

477
00:18:17,332 --> 00:18:18,699
I can protect you.

478
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,666
I can.

479
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:20,901
But you got, you
got to help me.

480
00:18:20,902 --> 00:18:22,102
I can help you.

481
00:18:22,103 --> 00:18:24,103
You're gonna help me? Yeah.

482
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:25,172
Tell me where I can find Julian.

483
00:18:25,173 --> 00:18:26,807
I don't deal with him like that.

484
00:18:26,808 --> 00:18:29,510
I get my stuff from this bitch
named Tatiana on Newkirk Avenue.

485
00:18:29,511 --> 00:18:31,378
Can you describe her to me?

486
00:18:31,379 --> 00:18:33,147
Well, she got brown eyes.
Okay.

487
00:18:33,148 --> 00:18:37,552
Mm, she got some
bigass "breastses."

488
00:18:37,553 --> 00:18:39,486
Big breastses. Okay.

489
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:42,856
Can you maybe be a little
bit more specific?

490
00:18:42,857 --> 00:18:46,261
Uh... like...

491
00:18:46,262 --> 00:18:50,131
her breastses is like this.

492
00:18:50,132 --> 00:18:51,798
Okay. Thank you.

493
00:18:56,905 --> 00:18:59,039
That's a shame.

494
00:19:04,981 --> 00:19:06,148
Don't.

495
00:19:06,149 --> 00:19:07,683
Oh, haha, oh, yeah!

496
00:19:07,684 --> 00:19:09,284
We're at a comedy party, yeah.

497
00:19:09,285 --> 00:19:10,885
Move the fuck out of my way.

498
00:19:10,886 --> 00:19:12,021
Get a room.

499
00:19:12,022 --> 00:19:14,290
Tim, you still owe me 40.

500
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,125
Yeah, tomorrow it's 60.

501
00:19:16,126 --> 00:19:17,993
Fucking dickweed.

502
00:19:17,994 --> 00:19:19,161
Why is the cage empty?

503
00:19:19,162 --> 00:19:21,665
What have I told you about
moving my prisoners?

504
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,366
He's in interrogation.

505
00:19:23,367 --> 00:19:26,802
Why would he be in interrogation
when I'm standing right here?

506
00:19:26,803 --> 00:19:28,404
Theythey came and got him.

507
00:19:28,405 --> 00:19:29,572
Who's "they"?

508
00:19:29,573 --> 00:19:31,508
Better be two of me.
Is it two of me?

509
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:32,776
It was a lady. She was...

510
00:19:32,777 --> 00:19:34,477
I'm a lady. Did I
come and get him?

511
00:19:34,478 --> 00:19:36,613
No, no, it was a different
lady, She was nice.

512
00:19:36,614 --> 00:19:37,981
I'm fuckin' nice. No, no.

513
00:19:37,982 --> 00:19:39,181
Why was she nice to you?

514
00:19:39,182 --> 00:19:40,550
She made me give her the keys.

515
00:19:40,551 --> 00:19:42,752
I'm gonna make you
fucking bend over,

516
00:19:42,753 --> 00:19:45,622
and I'm gonna reach up your
ass into your pocket and get

517
00:19:45,623 --> 00:19:46,823
the keys to your house.

518
00:19:46,824 --> 00:19:48,425
And then I'm gonna
drive there,

519
00:19:48,426 --> 00:19:50,995
come in your front fucking door
and kill you in your sleep.

520
00:19:50,996 --> 00:19:53,497
I think I have a clear idea
of what we're looking for,

521
00:19:53,498 --> 00:19:54,998
and I appreciate your time.

522
00:19:54,999 --> 00:19:56,900
Wow, lady, you're on
a real fuckin' roll.

523
00:19:56,901 --> 00:19:57,867
Excuse me? I...

524
00:19:57,868 --> 00:19:59,237
Yeah, no, I won't excuse you.

525
00:19:59,238 --> 00:20:00,605
I just spent the last 30 minutes

526
00:20:00,606 --> 00:20:01,939
thinking of different
ways to kill you.

527
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,774
I... I'm... I'm sorry,
when did we meet?

528
00:20:03,775 --> 00:20:05,509
What is this, your lawyer?

529
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,811
I'm... What are you,
insurance salesman?

530
00:20:06,812 --> 00:20:08,247
Do you sell those shitty suits?

531
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:09,580
I'm Special Agent Sarah Ashburn.

532
00:20:09,581 --> 00:20:10,948
How can I help you?

533
00:20:10,949 --> 00:20:12,750
You can get all of
that, get it up,

534
00:20:12,751 --> 00:20:15,152
and get it the fuck out of
here, 'cause this is my room.

535
00:20:15,153 --> 00:20:17,422
Were you, were you about to be,
uh, questioned by a detective?

536
00:20:17,423 --> 00:20:18,790
I am a detective,

537
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:21,126
and that's my perp. Ah.

538
00:20:21,127 --> 00:20:23,028
Ah, I... I understand now.

539
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:24,328
Well, um, Detective,

540
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:27,032
Mr. Rojas will be continuing
on with me at this point.

541
00:20:27,033 --> 00:20:27,933
No.

542
00:20:27,934 --> 00:20:29,668
It's a jurisdictional issue.

543
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:31,236
No, not gonna happen. And
so, uh, youryour efforts

544
00:20:31,237 --> 00:20:33,538
areare duly noted. Thank you so much.
Oh, great.

545
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:35,073
And if you're okay
with everything,

546
00:20:35,074 --> 00:20:36,276
could you justjust
maybe close the door

547
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:37,310
on the way out?

548
00:20:37,311 --> 00:20:38,845
I'll shut the door on you.

549
00:20:38,846 --> 00:20:40,746
Will you lay down here and
put your head in the door?

550
00:20:40,747 --> 00:20:43,548
And I'll slam it about
157,000 fucking times.

551
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:44,650
Aw, shit, girl, you better run.

552
00:20:44,651 --> 00:20:45,652
You need to shut your mouth.

553
00:20:45,653 --> 00:20:46,653
Run like you on fire.

554
00:20:46,654 --> 00:20:47,654
You need to be quiet.

555
00:20:47,655 --> 00:20:48,921
You're gonna get up,

556
00:20:48,922 --> 00:20:50,556
and we're gonna
settle this outside.

557
00:20:50,557 --> 00:20:52,191
Okay, now I'm... I won't
be going outside.

558
00:20:52,192 --> 00:20:54,761
You're gonna get up and
you're gonna come outside.

559
00:20:54,762 --> 00:20:55,862
No, ma'am. Not going outside.

560
00:20:55,863 --> 00:20:57,163
Fine. We'll do this inside.

561
00:20:57,164 --> 00:20:59,132
Can somebody please
remove this person

562
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:01,134
from the interrogation room?
We're good!

563
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:02,835
Mental illness is nothing
to be ashamed of.

564
00:21:02,836 --> 00:21:04,038
It runs in many families.

565
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:05,205
I'm gonna hit you.

566
00:21:05,206 --> 00:21:06,874
You're not gonna hit me.
Please don't.

567
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:07,908
I'm gonna hit you and knock
all your little buttons.

568
00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:08,909
Do not point your finger...

569
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,376
I'm gonna hit you there...

570
00:21:10,377 --> 00:21:11,678
No, do not put your
finger in my...

571
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:12,679
Stop touching my buttons,
stop touching...

572
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,281
Well, stop wearing buttons.

573
00:21:14,282 --> 00:21:16,717
Don't you... Don't you move
those fucking hands again.

574
00:21:16,718 --> 00:21:18,352
I'll get that stupid barrette.
H Hey, hey!

575
00:21:18,353 --> 00:21:20,554
I'll take that barrette right
out of your fucking hair!

576
00:21:20,555 --> 00:21:22,389
Hey, stop! Oh,
stop, stop, stop!

577
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:25,492
Hey, both of you, my office now.

578
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:27,628
Nope. Not in there.

579
00:21:27,629 --> 00:21:29,229
There is nothing I
can do, Mullins.

580
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,231
The FBI has jurisdiction.

581
00:21:31,232 --> 00:21:33,268
Maybe they're in here. Maybe
they're in here. Aw, come on.

582
00:21:33,269 --> 00:21:34,602
Nope. Stop. Will you stop?

583
00:21:34,603 --> 00:21:36,071
Nope, they're not in there.
Let me see.

584
00:21:36,072 --> 00:21:37,906
What is she doing?
They're not under there.

585
00:21:37,907 --> 00:21:40,307
She's looking for my balls.

586
00:21:40,308 --> 00:21:41,710
Oh.

587
00:21:41,711 --> 00:21:43,078
Hey, if anyone sees
the captain's balls,

588
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:44,245
let me know!

589
00:21:44,246 --> 00:21:47,115
They're about this
big, but a lot tinier.

590
00:21:47,116 --> 00:21:50,518
They're like a pea, or like
a, like a ball bearing,

591
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:52,788
or like, if you've ever
seen a mouse ball,

592
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:54,155
about half that size.

593
00:21:54,156 --> 00:21:55,690
Incredibly tiny.

594
00:21:55,691 --> 00:21:58,760
They're like really, really
tiny, little girl balls,

595
00:21:58,761 --> 00:22:00,196
if little girls had balls.

596
00:22:00,197 --> 00:22:02,965
So if you find little,
tiny, girl balls

597
00:22:02,966 --> 00:22:06,869
that are so fucking tiny and
shriveled up, let me know,

598
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:09,472
'cause I'll put them right
back up his scrotum!

599
00:22:09,473 --> 00:22:10,873
Knock it off, Mullins.

600
00:22:10,874 --> 00:22:12,441
How about you do
something for once?

601
00:22:12,442 --> 00:22:14,009
What do you want me to do?!

602
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:16,579
Uh, I'd like you to have my
back and stop being so goddamn

603
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,580
disappointing like
everybody else.

604
00:22:17,581 --> 00:22:19,483
Oh, well, that was professional.

605
00:22:19,484 --> 00:22:21,385
Oh, is that not professional?
Here.

606
00:22:21,386 --> 00:22:22,552
Let me, let me be professional.

607
00:22:22,553 --> 00:22:23,887
Let me help you
pick up your bag.

608
00:22:23,888 --> 00:22:25,253
That's very mature.

609
00:22:26,756 --> 00:22:28,992
Let me just straighten
that shit up.

610
00:22:28,993 --> 00:22:30,694
Oh, wait, hey, hey!

611
00:22:30,695 --> 00:22:31,862
Good news! Good news!

612
00:22:31,863 --> 00:22:33,296
I found his balls!

613
00:22:33,297 --> 00:22:34,765
Yeah, in a clear sack!

614
00:22:34,766 --> 00:22:35,932
Yeah, enjoy that.

615
00:22:35,933 --> 00:22:38,269
Shove those back up there.

616
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,070
Cop of the Year!

617
00:22:40,071 --> 00:22:42,372
Keep it up!

618
00:22:42,373 --> 00:22:44,407
This job is destroying me.

619
00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:47,278
You know how old I am?

620
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:49,847
Uh, uh, 58?

621
00:22:49,848 --> 00:22:52,283
I'm 43 years old.

622
00:22:52,284 --> 00:22:53,584
Mmhmm, mmhmm.

623
00:22:53,585 --> 00:22:55,318
Well, I always, see,
I always round up.

624
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:58,122
I have a fiveyearold son
who calls me Grandpa.

625
00:22:58,123 --> 00:23:02,026
So, uh, anywho, uh,
sir, if, um...

626
00:23:02,027 --> 00:23:07,533
if you could just, you know,
keep her away from me,

627
00:23:07,534 --> 00:23:10,535
that would be...
be very helpful.

628
00:23:10,536 --> 00:23:12,003
She stole your keys, didn't she?

629
00:23:12,004 --> 00:23:14,205
Yes, she did. Do you know
where I can find her?

630
00:23:14,206 --> 00:23:15,741
She's probably at O'Flanagan's.

631
00:23:15,742 --> 00:23:16,942
It's a bar down the street.

632
00:23:16,943 --> 00:23:18,110
Now, it's a little divey.

633
00:23:18,111 --> 00:23:19,944
You might want to wear a vest.

Oh, wow. Wow, okay,

Oh, my God.

653
00:24:02,991 --> 00:24:05,326
Did you drop something?

654
00:24:05,327 --> 00:24:07,595
Apologize. Apologies.

655
00:24:07,596 --> 00:24:09,529
You are so concerned about

656
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,966
taking down a guy like Rojas
when we have just wasted

657
00:24:11,967 --> 00:24:14,268
all this time, when I could
have stopped a drug lord

658
00:24:14,269 --> 00:24:17,705
who is far more dangerous and
supplies to people like Rojas.

659
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:18,873
Bullshit. Oh, really?

660
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,107
Who? Oh.

661
00:24:20,108 --> 00:24:22,277
Okay, you want to see
some bull feces?

662
00:24:22,278 --> 00:24:23,945
I think I said bullshit,
is what I said.

663
00:24:23,946 --> 00:24:25,446
Here you go. Here's
some bull poopoo.

664
00:24:25,447 --> 00:24:28,082
How's this for bull feces?
How does that look? Huh?

665
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:28,949
See that?

666
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,285
Oh, come on. I got a kid here.

667
00:24:30,286 --> 00:24:31,753
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

668
00:24:31,754 --> 00:24:33,121
I'm, I'm very
sorry, very sorry.

669
00:24:33,122 --> 00:24:35,190
Wait a minute, this is a bar.

670
00:24:35,191 --> 00:24:36,258
This is a b...

671
00:24:36,259 --> 00:24:37,292
No, absolutely not.

672
00:24:37,293 --> 00:24:38,760
Nononononono. Nonononono.

673
00:24:38,761 --> 00:24:40,662
Why do I not know who
Simon Larkin is?

674
00:24:40,663 --> 00:24:41,863
Uh, that would
probably be because

675
00:24:41,864 --> 00:24:43,298
the FBI knows
more than you do.

676
00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:44,933
Uh, anything that's happening
in my neighborhood,

677
00:24:44,934 --> 00:24:46,167
I have a right to know.

678
00:24:46,168 --> 00:24:47,769
Uh, no, you actually don't.

679
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,272
You want to know.

680
00:24:49,273 --> 00:24:51,541
And you do not have the
clearance that would allow you

681
00:24:51,542 --> 00:24:54,243
to read everything that
is on this file, okay?

682
00:24:54,244 --> 00:24:55,110
Okay, all right!

683
00:24:55,111 --> 00:24:56,711
You know, when
bad shit happens

684
00:24:56,712 --> 00:25:00,650
in my neighborhood, I get a
little passionate about it.

685
00:25:00,651 --> 00:25:02,518
I shouldn't have
read your files.

686
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:03,986
I went too far.

687
00:25:03,987 --> 00:25:06,389
Well, I... I accept
your apology.

688
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:07,925
But you need to understand

689
00:25:07,926 --> 00:25:10,092
that this is a highly
important case

690
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:12,795
and the information is
highly, highly sensitive.

691
00:25:12,796 --> 00:25:14,530
Therefore, we have these
clearances that mean...

692
00:25:14,531 --> 00:25:15,932
I don't have the clearances.

693
00:25:15,933 --> 00:25:17,134
I don't have the
clearances, right?

694
00:25:17,135 --> 00:25:20,837
I mean, you're...
you are, wow, FBI.

695
00:25:20,838 --> 00:25:22,072
Yes. I mean, you are...

696
00:25:22,073 --> 00:25:24,107
you're a goddamn
angel of the law.

697
00:25:24,108 --> 00:25:26,208
Well, I... that's a little...

698
00:25:26,209 --> 00:25:28,745
You know, I want you to spread
those wings out and just soar.

699
00:25:28,746 --> 00:25:29,746
While I appreciate
the sentiment...

700
00:25:29,747 --> 00:25:31,548
Hey!

701
00:25:31,549 --> 00:25:32,716
It's certainly not...

702
00:25:32,717 --> 00:25:34,351
Watch it.

703
00:25:34,352 --> 00:25:35,519
You watch it.

704
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,688
I'm a federal agent.

705
00:25:36,689 --> 00:25:37,822
Oh, yeah? Yeah.

706
00:25:37,823 --> 00:25:39,457
Well, guess what, you dick.

707
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:41,425
I'm a federal agent, too.

708
00:25:41,426 --> 00:25:43,427
I work at The Post Office.

709
00:25:43,428 --> 00:25:45,196
Well, I... I appreciate

710
00:25:45,197 --> 00:25:47,532
the work you do for us
down on the ground.

711
00:25:47,533 --> 00:25:48,666
Thank you. Thank you.

712
00:25:48,667 --> 00:25:50,101
Bet your ass you do.

713
00:25:50,102 --> 00:25:51,869
I can see no one will be
getting their mail today.

714
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,037
Wow.

715
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:54,205
Good burn. Good burn.

716
00:25:54,206 --> 00:25:56,975
You got burned, you
big drunk paddy!

717
00:25:56,976 --> 00:25:58,543
Kiss my cunt, you twat!

718
00:25:58,544 --> 00:25:59,711
Yeah. So we are...

719
00:25:59,712 --> 00:26:01,445
Hey. We are good?

720
00:26:02,497 --> 00:26:03,425
Thank you. Thank you.

721
00:26:03,783 --> 00:26:05,184
Hey, America thanks you.

722
00:26:05,185 --> 00:26:06,418
And I, it.

723
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:07,720
And it, you.

724
00:26:07,721 --> 00:26:09,388
Thank you.

725
00:26:09,389 --> 00:26:10,855
Whoaoa.

726
00:26:10,856 --> 00:26:13,192
Yes, okay.

727
00:26:13,193 --> 00:26:14,325
Good day.

728
00:26:16,463 --> 00:26:18,163
Dumbass.

729
00:26:18,164 --> 00:26:20,933
All prisoners, clear the yards.

730
00:26:20,934 --> 00:26:22,802
<i>So how you been, Jason?</i>

731
00:26:22,803 --> 00:26:24,870
You want to talk
about Simon Larkin?

732
00:26:24,871 --> 00:26:27,506
Uh, I never heard of him.

733
00:26:27,507 --> 00:26:29,041
Don't fucking lie to me.

734
00:26:29,042 --> 00:26:31,510
You're my goddamn brother,
I know when you're lying.

735
00:26:31,511 --> 00:26:33,613
I'm just a lowlevel guy.

736
00:26:33,614 --> 00:26:36,449
Okay? I heard of Larkin, but,
you know, I never met him.

737
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:38,018
Yeah, well, he's a
goddamn animal,

738
00:26:38,019 --> 00:26:39,985
and I'm trying to keep
him from meeting you.

739
00:26:39,986 --> 00:26:41,788
What, are you gonna
storm through Boston

740
00:26:41,789 --> 00:26:43,323
and take down a drug lord?

741
00:26:43,324 --> 00:26:45,392
Yeah, I might.

742
00:26:45,393 --> 00:26:46,893
Have you met me?

743
00:26:46,894 --> 00:26:48,495
Yeah, unfortunately.

744
00:26:48,496 --> 00:26:50,765
Yeah, shut up.

745
00:26:50,766 --> 00:26:52,833
Look, I get out
tomorrow, okay?

746
00:26:52,834 --> 00:26:54,001
I... I'm coming home.

747
00:26:54,002 --> 00:26:55,168
I'm gonna be fine.

748
00:26:55,169 --> 00:26:57,236
I promise, all right?

749
00:27:13,754 --> 00:27:15,156
Oh! Jesus!

750
00:27:15,157 --> 00:27:16,590
Never approach me if
I'm not expecting you!

751
00:27:16,591 --> 00:27:18,626
Cheese and rice, what
are you, an animal?!

752
00:27:18,627 --> 00:27:20,095
Okay, you know what?

753
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,363
You said you would
stay off my case,

754
00:27:21,364 --> 00:27:22,998
and where do I find you?
Right here.

755
00:27:22,999 --> 00:27:24,566
Right here in front of
Tatiana's apartment.

756
00:27:24,567 --> 00:27:25,800
What? I live here.

757
00:27:25,801 --> 00:27:27,168
Oh, okay, that's hilarious.

758
00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:28,603
Yeah, okay, you know
what's not funny?

759
00:27:28,604 --> 00:27:31,106
That you stole a
confidential FBI case file.

760
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:33,141
Oh, that's funny, I don't
remember any of that.

761
00:27:33,142 --> 00:27:35,177
I'm gonna say this
one more time.

762
00:27:35,178 --> 00:27:36,578
Stand down, Officer.

763
00:27:36,579 --> 00:27:37,747
Fuck off, Officer.

764
00:27:37,748 --> 00:27:39,382
Oh, okay, guess what?

765
00:27:39,383 --> 00:27:41,183
Now you've really done it.
I'm gonna call my boss.

766
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:43,685
Yeah, you do that,
tattle tits!

767
00:27:43,686 --> 00:27:45,020
Fucking narc!

768
00:27:45,021 --> 00:27:47,823
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

769
00:27:51,495 --> 00:27:52,495
Hale.

770
00:27:52,496 --> 00:27:53,563
It's Ashburn, sir.

771
00:27:53,564 --> 00:27:55,397
I'm gonna need authorization

772
00:27:55,398 --> 00:27:58,367
to suspend a police officer
from my investigation, sir.

773
00:27:58,368 --> 00:28:01,237
Ashburn, why is working
with local authorities

774
00:28:01,238 --> 00:28:03,106
a problem for you?
Sir, it's not.

775
00:28:03,107 --> 00:28:05,943
I understand how this might
sound coming from me,

776
00:28:05,944 --> 00:28:07,945
but I... I think this individual

777
00:28:07,946 --> 00:28:10,013
might actually be
mentally unstable.

778
00:28:10,014 --> 00:28:11,214
According to her captain,

779
00:28:11,215 --> 00:28:12,515
she grew up on those streets

780
00:28:12,516 --> 00:28:14,083
and she knows them
better than anyone.

781
00:28:14,084 --> 00:28:15,719
That seems like an asset
to our investigation.

782
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,920
Nonono. Sir, I...

783
00:28:16,921 --> 00:28:18,388
Just work with her.

784
00:28:18,389 --> 00:28:21,057
Just show me you can do this
or forget the promotion.

785
00:28:23,862 --> 00:28:27,197
Well, sir, no need, no need
to take someone's badge.

786
00:28:27,198 --> 00:28:28,565
I think I can, uh...

787
00:28:28,566 --> 00:28:30,968
I think I can work
something out, sir.

788
00:28:30,969 --> 00:28:32,970
All right. Thank you.

789
00:28:32,971 --> 00:28:34,672
Byebye.

790
00:28:34,673 --> 00:28:37,108
You know, uh...

791
00:28:37,109 --> 00:28:39,878
I just, I think just...
I think you and I

792
00:28:39,879 --> 00:28:41,278
got off on the wrong foot.

793
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,414
Oh. I don't know Boston,

794
00:28:43,415 --> 00:28:45,450
and you obviously have
a a lot of resources

795
00:28:45,451 --> 00:28:48,052
and a lot of knowledge about
the area thatthat could be,

796
00:28:48,053 --> 00:28:49,687
you know, could be useful.

797
00:28:49,688 --> 00:28:51,523
Probably very.

798
00:28:51,524 --> 00:28:53,359
So, uh, maybe we can
work together on this.

799
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,161
Yeah, I don't need your
help to take down Larkin.

800
00:28:56,162 --> 00:28:58,029
You know, you wouldn't even
have known about Larkin

801
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,998
if it wasn't for me, so
obviously the FBI can

802
00:28:59,999 --> 00:29:01,199
get information that
you can't, okay?

803
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,002
And there's a lot more

804
00:29:03,003 --> 00:29:04,537
where that comes from... a lot.

805
00:29:04,538 --> 00:29:06,272
Maybe I just need
to hear a little.

806
00:29:06,273 --> 00:29:07,873
"I need your help, Mullins."

807
00:29:07,874 --> 00:29:09,308
No, I won't be doing that.

808
00:29:09,309 --> 00:29:11,176
Okay, well, get your
ass back in your car.

809
00:29:11,177 --> 00:29:12,244
Okay, this is ridiculous, okay?

810
00:29:12,245 --> 00:29:13,579
I'm an FBI agent,

811
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,314
you're a police officer.
It's not...

812
00:29:15,315 --> 00:29:16,916
"I need your help, Mullins."

813
00:29:16,917 --> 00:29:18,551
I need your help, Mullins.

814
00:29:18,552 --> 00:29:21,153
Oh, God, what is... is
this a whisper party?

815
00:29:22,189 --> 00:29:23,990
I want that third
floor to hear it.

816
00:29:23,991 --> 00:29:25,491
"I need your help, Mullins."

817
00:29:25,492 --> 00:29:28,359
And then maybe give me a
little echo on that "Mullins."

818
00:29:32,933 --> 00:29:34,634
I need your help, Mullins!

819
00:29:34,635 --> 00:29:36,102
Mullins, Mullins...

820
00:29:36,103 --> 00:29:38,939
Just move, move, move!

821
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,208
God.

822
00:29:40,209 --> 00:29:41,808
Even in that, you're annoying.

823
00:29:41,809 --> 00:29:43,476
I will work with you,

824
00:29:43,477 --> 00:29:46,079
as long as we're clear
that this is my case.

825
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,814
That's actually not correct.

826
00:29:47,815 --> 00:29:49,951
This isn't your... Awesome.
Glad you see it my way.

827
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,687
Careful of the car.

828
00:29:52,688 --> 00:29:53,920
Goddamn it.

829
00:29:58,359 --> 00:30:00,761
Stand down. I got it.

830
00:30:00,762 --> 00:30:02,597
If you just, if you just let go.
I got it.

831
00:30:02,598 --> 00:30:04,198
I think I have it, just...
I got it.

832
00:30:04,199 --> 00:30:05,666
Just let me...

833
00:30:05,667 --> 00:30:08,103
I got it. Geez.

834
00:30:08,104 --> 00:30:10,271
Oh, shit.

835
00:30:20,749 --> 00:30:21,917
Ma'am, you, uh...

836
00:30:21,918 --> 00:30:24,353
Just go. Just go.

837
00:30:24,354 --> 00:30:26,153
Okay, now let me take
the lead on this.

838
00:30:26,154 --> 00:30:28,023
I'm a trained interviewer.
"Interviewer"?

839
00:30:28,024 --> 00:30:29,258
What are you, fucking
Barbara Walters?

840
00:30:29,259 --> 00:30:30,425
I just thought we were
gonna go in there

841
00:30:30,426 --> 00:30:31,960
and bring in some heat on her.

842
00:30:31,961 --> 00:30:33,295
I'm sorry, w what is...
what does that even mean?

843
00:30:33,296 --> 00:30:34,296
What does that mean?

844
00:30:34,297 --> 00:30:35,665
Me and you, we're the heat.

845
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:37,033
We go in there, we
interrogate her,

846
00:30:37,034 --> 00:30:38,268
we scare the shit
out of her...

847
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:39,602
See, we don't say
"interrogation."

848
00:30:39,603 --> 00:30:41,270
It's, it's much
too aggressive.

849
00:30:41,271 --> 00:30:43,305
Rule number one: Catch more
with sugar than a stick.

850
00:30:43,306 --> 00:30:44,940
That's a horrible
fucking saying.

851
00:30:44,941 --> 00:30:46,976
Okay, well, what we like to
do isis create aa genuine

852
00:30:46,977 --> 00:30:48,578
personal interest
in the subject,

853
00:30:48,579 --> 00:30:50,546
allowing them to open up. But
from then, I'm going to...

854
00:30:50,547 --> 00:30:52,548
Oh, God... uh, perform instant
personality assessments

855
00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:54,418
based on the MyersBriggs
theory, uh,

856
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,052
Thematic Apperception
Tests, and a few...

857
00:30:56,053 --> 00:30:57,787
well, a few others I won't,
I won't bore you with.

858
00:30:57,788 --> 00:31:00,390
Oh, my God, well, that's...
I am balls deep in boredom.

859
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:02,225
All right, as long
as you don't do

860
00:31:02,226 --> 00:31:03,693
that whole goddamn long
explanation again,

861
00:31:03,694 --> 00:31:05,329
we'll try it your way first.
Okay.

862
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,764
Only 'cause you're older.

863
00:31:06,765 --> 00:31:08,298
Oh, my God.

864
00:31:13,904 --> 00:31:15,406
Tatiana Krumova.

865
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:17,174
I'm Special Agent
Sarah Ashburn,

866
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:18,442
and this is Detective Mullins.

867
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:20,344
Detective Mullins.
Detective Mullins.

868
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:22,413
And we'd like to ask
you a few questions,

869
00:31:22,414 --> 00:31:23,548
if you could give us a moment.

870
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:25,816
Oh, shoot, you know, now is bad.

871
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:27,685
Oh. I'm making butter.

872
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:28,485
Oh. Oh, that's...

873
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:29,920
How about other time?

874
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:31,422
Well, if you could... How
about right fucking now?

875
00:31:31,423 --> 00:31:32,791
How's that? How's that?

876
00:31:32,792 --> 00:31:34,392
Right fucking now.

877
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:35,627
Well, Tatiana, thank you.

878
00:31:35,628 --> 00:31:37,629
This is, this is
very kind of you.

879
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:38,930
So...

880
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:41,031
how long have you lived here?

881
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:43,101
I've lived here
since I moved in.

882
00:31:43,102 --> 00:31:44,402
Shit.

883
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:47,405
Okay, that's very,
very helpful.

884
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:49,107
Okay, we'll get a
little more specific.

885
00:31:49,108 --> 00:31:50,208
Uh, what do you do

886
00:31:50,209 --> 00:31:51,510
for a living?

887
00:31:51,511 --> 00:31:53,479
I know what this asshole
does for a living.

888
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,880
What you know, asshole?

889
00:31:54,881 --> 00:31:56,147
Okay, sugar, no stick.

890
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:58,083
It is Bulgarian, is it not?

891
00:31:58,084 --> 00:31:59,818
No, I'm fucking French.

892
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:00,987
Oh, Jesus.

893
00:32:00,988 --> 00:32:02,120
Tatiana...

894
00:32:04,591 --> 00:32:06,325
I don't understand
what you're saying.

895
00:32:06,326 --> 00:32:07,660
Nice bullshit Bulgarian.

896
00:32:07,661 --> 00:32:09,563
Okay, you know what? That
was perfect Bulgarian.

897
00:32:09,564 --> 00:32:11,530
I mean, I don't understand
what you're talking about.

898
00:32:11,531 --> 00:32:13,966
Why I go to jail when
I don't do shits?

899
00:32:13,967 --> 00:32:15,534
Ah, okay.

900
00:32:15,535 --> 00:32:17,403
So she did understand
what I was saying,

901
00:32:17,404 --> 00:32:18,805
she just didn't
understand the context

902
00:32:18,806 --> 00:32:20,574
in which I said it to her.
Oh, sweet God.

903
00:32:20,575 --> 00:32:23,210
Okay, okay, all right,
Rosetta Stone, you're done.

904
00:32:23,211 --> 00:32:24,778
God.

905
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:25,911
Oh, Jesus.

906
00:32:25,912 --> 00:32:28,181
How many porns have been
made on this couch?

907
00:32:28,182 --> 00:32:29,950
Oh, this couch not of
your satisfaction?

908
00:32:29,951 --> 00:32:31,418
You're not comfy?

909
00:32:31,419 --> 00:32:32,819
I'll get comfy. When
my foot's up your ass.

910
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,154
Wow.

911
00:32:34,155 --> 00:32:35,422
That'll make me really comfy.
Stop.

912
00:32:35,423 --> 00:32:36,656
Don't poke me. Don't poke me.

913
00:32:36,657 --> 00:32:39,060
Listen, Tatiana, I want
to get really real.

914
00:32:39,061 --> 00:32:40,328
You ready to get
real, Tatiana?

915
00:32:40,329 --> 00:32:41,595
Let's get real.

916
00:32:41,596 --> 00:32:43,230
Okay, we both know you've been

917
00:32:43,231 --> 00:32:44,398
blowing shit up
your nose all day.

918
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:45,799
Man, I get it.

919
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,568
There's nothing more
I'd love to do than

920
00:32:47,569 --> 00:32:50,805
slip into my camisole, put my
feet up, have a little smack.

921
00:32:50,806 --> 00:32:52,607
Real good time, maybe
a couple cold ones,

922
00:32:52,608 --> 00:32:54,242
a little chip and dip,
watch some cartoons.

923
00:32:54,243 --> 00:32:55,743
I'd get a big bowl

924
00:32:55,744 --> 00:32:58,579
of fucking coke, I'd just
put my face right in it,

925
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,181
cut it with a little Ritalin.

926
00:33:00,182 --> 00:33:01,449
Heaven on fucking earth, right?

927
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:02,417
Sure. I'd camp out all week

928
00:33:02,418 --> 00:33:03,818
for tickets to that show.

929
00:33:03,819 --> 00:33:05,420
<i>WhWhatwhat is this,
Training Day?</i>

930
00:33:05,421 --> 00:33:08,090
All fucking week, I'd
camp out for that.

931
00:33:08,091 --> 00:33:09,625
But you, you piece of shit,

932
00:33:09,626 --> 00:33:11,459
you've been rolling
deep for a long time,

933
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:14,128
and now it's time you open
up that goddamn mouth

934
00:33:14,129 --> 00:33:15,831
and tell us what
we want to know.

935
00:33:15,832 --> 00:33:17,866
You got good point.
I tell you what.

936
00:33:17,867 --> 00:33:19,468
I open my mouth.

937
00:33:19,469 --> 00:33:21,570
You get the fuck
out my house now!

938
00:33:21,571 --> 00:33:23,105
How's that for open mouth?

939
00:33:23,106 --> 00:33:25,108
Fuck out! Get fuck out!

940
00:33:25,109 --> 00:33:26,909
Yeah. I'll get the fuck out.

941
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,343
All right.

942
00:33:28,344 --> 00:33:30,546
You should really stop
smoking, 'cause, uh...

943
00:33:30,547 --> 00:33:31,947
it's an awfully bad habit.

944
00:33:31,948 --> 00:33:34,217
You're leaving half your
lipstick in the ashtray.

945
00:33:34,218 --> 00:33:36,653
I had a, uh, great
aunt that lost

946
00:33:36,654 --> 00:33:38,588
most of her teeth
to, uh, smoking.

947
00:33:38,589 --> 00:33:40,356
Good to know. A lot
of fistfights, too,

948
00:33:40,357 --> 00:33:41,723
but, uh, mostly smoking.

949
00:33:41,724 --> 00:33:42,691
You know what?

950
00:33:42,692 --> 00:33:43,893
We're gonna get
out of your hair.

951
00:33:43,894 --> 00:33:44,727
So we're just gonna...

952
00:33:44,728 --> 00:33:45,928
What? That is not front door.

953
00:33:47,331 --> 00:33:48,598
Put your hands where I
can fucking see them!

954
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:50,066
Don't fucking move.

955
00:33:50,067 --> 00:33:51,534
What is this, your drug mule?!

956
00:33:51,535 --> 00:33:53,003
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my goodness.
That's my mother!

957
00:33:53,004 --> 00:33:55,139
Huh? Do you have balloons
of horse up your ass?!

958
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,906
You break my fucking door!
Stand down, Officer.

959
00:33:56,907 --> 00:33:57,874
Stand down, Officer.

960
00:33:57,875 --> 00:33:59,375
Who closes the door
to take a shit?!

961
00:33:59,376 --> 00:34:00,543
Get out! Humans do.

962
00:34:00,544 --> 00:34:02,413
Get out now. You get out.

963
00:34:02,414 --> 00:34:03,747
D Don't touch underpants!
Thank you.

964
00:34:03,748 --> 00:34:05,216
Get out, bull in China shop!

965
00:34:05,217 --> 00:34:06,383
Out of my house!

966
00:34:06,384 --> 00:34:07,918
What the fuck's wrong with you?!

967
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,621
Wow, you are just all
stick and no sugar.

968
00:34:10,622 --> 00:34:12,923
Did you get the
cigarette or not?

969
00:34:12,924 --> 00:34:17,394
Uh, uh, yeah, yeah,
ofofof course I did.

970
00:34:17,395 --> 00:34:18,695
Yeah.

971
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,999
I snagged these matches, too.

972
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,968
I think our guy likes
to go to Club Ekko.

973
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:24,136
Okay, hold on.

974
00:34:24,137 --> 00:34:25,303
Come on. Really?

975
00:34:25,304 --> 00:34:26,470
Yes, yes, really.

976
00:34:26,471 --> 00:34:28,005
Let's find out, shall we?

977
00:34:28,006 --> 00:34:29,373
All right, hang on.

978
00:34:29,374 --> 00:34:32,444
That couch was disgusting,
I need to wash my hands.

979
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:35,213
Wait a minute, you do,
you do live here?

980
00:34:35,214 --> 00:34:37,716
That's what I said.

981
00:34:37,717 --> 00:34:39,684
Oh.

982
00:34:41,987 --> 00:34:45,357
Wow, your windows are all...
all boarded up.

983
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:47,225
Yeah, I've got the glass,

984
00:34:47,226 --> 00:34:49,829
I just don't have the, you
know, the window blankets.

985
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:52,265
The curtains? You mean,
you mean the curtains?

986
00:34:52,266 --> 00:34:54,699
Whatever. Okay?

987
00:34:56,202 --> 00:34:58,204
That's just my family.

988
00:34:58,205 --> 00:34:59,372
That's...

989
00:34:59,373 --> 00:35:01,541
Oh.

990
00:35:01,542 --> 00:35:03,442
Yeah, it's sweet.

991
00:35:03,443 --> 00:35:05,144
You want something to eat?

992
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:06,946
I didn't finish my submarine
sandwich from the other day.

993
00:35:06,947 --> 00:35:09,249
Oh, God, no, thank you.
Thank you.

994
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:11,951
Well, I'm sorry I don't have
poached eggs in rubies for you.

995
00:35:11,952 --> 00:35:14,987
No, I... I don't, I
don't mean to be rude,

996
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:18,859
but one could catch aa MRSA
infection in here, that's all.

997
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,794
Yeah, what part of
that wasn't rude?

998
00:35:20,795 --> 00:35:22,229
Just for your, for
your own wellbeing.

999
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,630
I mean, for example, that door.

1000
00:35:23,631 --> 00:35:25,566
That door has absolutely
no way of locking.

1001
00:35:25,567 --> 00:35:26,934
Someone could barge
in at any moment.

1002
00:35:26,935 --> 00:35:28,035
It's not safe.

1003
00:35:28,036 --> 00:35:29,503
No one's coming in here,

1004
00:35:29,504 --> 00:35:33,040
'cause they know I keep
this fully stocked.

1005
00:35:33,041 --> 00:35:34,308
Oh, my God.

1006
00:35:34,309 --> 00:35:35,309
Yeah, I know.

1007
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:37,145
A Marlin 1894 CB?

1008
00:35:37,146 --> 00:35:38,313
Yeah.

1009
00:35:38,314 --> 00:35:40,114
Is that a FNPS 90?

1010
00:35:40,115 --> 00:35:41,249
Yeah. Nice one.

1011
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,549
You have all this
in your house?

1012
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:44,318
Yeah. You didn't even
mention my baby.

1013
00:35:44,319 --> 00:35:45,453
Look at this.

1014
00:35:45,454 --> 00:35:46,988
Oh, oh. Wow, wow.

1015
00:35:46,989 --> 00:35:48,422
My little pride and joy.

1016
00:35:49,925 --> 00:35:51,292
Okay.

1017
00:35:51,293 --> 00:35:54,496
This little beauty could
vaporize an aboveground pool,

1018
00:35:54,497 --> 00:35:56,265
if you didn't want the
pool anymore, you know?

1019
00:35:56,266 --> 00:35:57,899
No kidding. Pretty, huh?

1020
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,535
Yeah, how do you, how do you
refuse that sales pitch, huh?

1021
00:36:00,536 --> 00:36:03,271
You don't, unless
you're an asshole.

1022
00:36:03,272 --> 00:36:05,674
Wow.

1023
00:36:05,675 --> 00:36:07,943
Haven't seen one of these
since, what, World War II?

1024
00:36:07,944 --> 00:36:09,678
No, God, that's...
occasionally ticks.

1025
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:11,046
Put it back slowly.

1026
00:36:11,047 --> 00:36:12,213
Okay, okay. Slowly!

1027
00:36:12,214 --> 00:36:13,349
I'm sorry.

1028
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:14,516
Like, half that speed.

1029
00:36:14,517 --> 00:36:15,918
That's... God, okay.

1030
00:36:15,919 --> 00:36:18,153
Half that speed.

1031
00:36:18,154 --> 00:36:20,289
Stop sha... Put
your pinky down.

1032
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:21,824
I got it on eBay.

1033
00:36:21,825 --> 00:36:23,159
It was supposed to be
bigger and different.

1034
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,494
It doesn't matter.

1035
00:36:24,495 --> 00:36:27,262
I'm gonna "bad feedback"
his ass though.

1036
00:36:42,612 --> 00:36:44,748
All right, ladies.
Here's the DNA results

1037
00:36:44,749 --> 00:36:46,783
from the book of matches
and the cigarette butt

1038
00:36:46,784 --> 00:36:48,251
you got from Tatiana's.

1039
00:36:48,252 --> 00:36:49,819
We pulled two sets of prints.

1040
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,756
First one's a real nut job.

1041
00:36:51,757 --> 00:36:53,324
Look at this:
Reckless driving,

1042
00:36:53,325 --> 00:36:54,557
assault, arson.

1043
00:36:55,727 --> 00:36:57,661
Oh, God. Really?

1044
00:36:57,662 --> 00:36:58,862
Who the fuck is this guy?

1045
00:36:58,863 --> 00:37:00,331
He's my assistant. What...

1046
00:37:00,332 --> 00:37:01,465
Uh, you know I'm
an agent, right?

1047
00:37:01,466 --> 00:37:03,601
Arson? It was a drug house.

1048
00:37:03,602 --> 00:37:05,236
God, I... I really feel the need

1049
00:37:05,237 --> 00:37:06,904
to finish reading your files,
because this is just, um...

1050
00:37:06,905 --> 00:37:08,806
I feel the need for you to
stay out of my business

1051
00:37:08,807 --> 00:37:10,575
so I don't punch you in the teeth.
Okay. Okay. Okay.

1052
00:37:10,576 --> 00:37:12,276
All right, what did you find
out about the cigarette?

1053
00:37:12,277 --> 00:37:14,211
Okay. Hank LeSoire.

1054
00:37:14,212 --> 00:37:15,579
Local businessman.

1055
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,715
Got tons of ties to the
drug world, black market,

1056
00:37:17,716 --> 00:37:18,850
as well as prostitution rings.

1057
00:37:18,851 --> 00:37:20,252
Coowner of Club Ekko.

1058
00:37:20,253 --> 00:37:22,087
Well, it looks like we
found our distributor.

1059
00:37:22,088 --> 00:37:23,922
Can you, can you back
that up, please?

1060
00:37:23,923 --> 00:37:25,390
Back up to which one? That.

1061
00:37:25,391 --> 00:37:26,924
Hey! I'm not into you.

1062
00:37:26,925 --> 00:37:28,760
Your breast is invading my space.
It's just...

1063
00:37:28,761 --> 00:37:30,562
Well, keep your finger
out of my areola.

1064
00:37:30,563 --> 00:37:32,731
Well, contain your areola.

1065
00:37:32,732 --> 00:37:34,132
There. Now we're even.

1066
00:37:34,133 --> 00:37:36,702
Well, he looks like a
real Chatty Cathy.

1067
00:37:36,703 --> 00:37:37,804
Did you tap the phone?

1068
00:37:37,805 --> 00:37:39,238
I haven't been able to.

1069
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:41,040
Guy gets a new prepaid
every other week. Yeah.

1070
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:42,374
By the time I can get
his phone number

1071
00:37:42,375 --> 00:37:43,909
and hack in, he's
got a new one.

1072
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:45,811
Well, let's get a bug into the
phone this guy does have.

1073
00:37:45,812 --> 00:37:47,046
I want to know what
he's saying this week.

1074
00:37:47,047 --> 00:37:48,481
Yeah, just get a court
order and a bug,

1075
00:37:48,482 --> 00:37:49,749
and we'll just do it ourselves.
Right.

1076
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:50,950
If you're gonna
boss me around,

1077
00:37:50,951 --> 00:37:52,318
you can at least buy
me dinner first.

1078
00:37:52,319 --> 00:37:53,920
No. Okay. Cool.

1079
00:37:53,921 --> 00:37:55,955
I'll get that to you ASAP.

1080
00:37:55,956 --> 00:37:57,724
You gotta work on your game.

1081
00:37:57,725 --> 00:37:59,025
That was weak.

1082
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:01,027
What? I thought I
was being charming.

1083
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:02,795
I don't know what
to say to that.

1084
00:38:02,796 --> 00:38:04,763
Now I just feel bad for you.

1085
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:08,135
Okay, so LeSoire
coowns Club Ekko.

1086
00:38:08,136 --> 00:38:09,870
Let's get over there and
start surveilling it

1087
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:11,871
and figure out how to
get a bug in his phone.

1088
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:13,172
Tell me everything
you know about it.

1089
00:38:13,173 --> 00:38:15,109
It's just a shitty
club downtown.

1090
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:17,111
I've never been inside of it,
but there's always a line

1091
00:38:17,112 --> 00:38:19,079
of awful people
around the corner,

1092
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,281
and they've called PD a couple
of times to break up fights...

1093
00:38:21,282 --> 00:38:22,282
Oh, shit.

1094
00:38:22,283 --> 00:38:23,884
What's wrong?

1095
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:25,420
Justjust don't look, don't look...
don't look!

1096
00:38:25,421 --> 00:38:27,488
Just act like we're talking.
Hey, Shannon.

1097
00:38:27,489 --> 00:38:28,822
Hey, Robin.

1098
00:38:28,823 --> 00:38:30,624
I really enjoyed our
night together, Shannon.

1099
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:31,792
You just disappeared on me.

1100
00:38:31,793 --> 00:38:33,494
Yeah, I know. I was there.

1101
00:38:33,495 --> 00:38:35,830
Well, can I take you to dinner
or a movie or something?

1102
00:38:35,831 --> 00:38:37,699
God, buddy, do you not
hear how pathetic

1103
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,100
everything out of
your mouth sounds?

1104
00:38:39,101 --> 00:38:40,668
I mean, there's a girl
out there for you,

1105
00:38:40,669 --> 00:38:42,302
but it's not, it's not me.

1106
00:38:42,303 --> 00:38:43,738
Maybe it's her.

1107
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:45,573
Her lady business is
like an old dirty attic.

1108
00:38:45,574 --> 00:38:46,908
It's full of broken
Christmas lights

1109
00:38:46,909 --> 00:38:48,276
and, like, doll shoes and shit.

1110
00:38:48,277 --> 00:38:50,310
Why don't you clean
that out for her.

1111
00:38:51,379 --> 00:38:52,681
Uh, that's a,

1112
00:38:52,682 --> 00:38:55,084
that's a misrepresentation
of my vagina.

1113
00:38:55,085 --> 00:38:57,519
Oh, wow, what was that about?

1114
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,020
You sleep with a guy one time,

1115
00:38:59,021 --> 00:39:00,455
and he wants to get
married to you.

1116
00:39:00,456 --> 00:39:01,623
Jesus Christ.

1117
00:39:01,624 --> 00:39:03,224
Yeah, I know what you mean.

My Mom.

1123
00:39:14,437 --> 00:39:16,672
Ortiz settles into
the batter's box.

1124
00:39:16,673 --> 00:39:18,941
Verlander with the pitch
and a ground ball

1125
00:39:18,942 --> 00:39:21,344
right side through the legs
of Cabrera into right field.

1126
00:39:21,345 --> 00:39:23,947
Pedroia is headed
for second base.

1127
00:39:23,948 --> 00:39:25,415
He slides and he is...

1128
00:39:25,416 --> 00:39:27,850
How about I tell you a little
something about myself?

1129
00:39:27,851 --> 00:39:29,151
Oh, God. Let's see.

1130
00:39:29,152 --> 00:39:31,721
I went to undergrad at Yale.

1131
00:39:31,722 --> 00:39:35,358
I have been with the
Bureau for about 12 years.

1132
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,761
Um, up for a promotion.

1133
00:39:37,762 --> 00:39:39,697
See, I... I caught the,
um, I caught the Red...

1134
00:39:39,698 --> 00:39:41,699
the Red Falls Killer.

1135
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,600
Yeah, I remember thinking
that guy was innocent.

1136
00:39:43,601 --> 00:39:45,402
Yeah, he's been in
jail for 11 months.

1137
00:39:45,403 --> 00:39:48,004
That would make me
a horrible person,

1138
00:39:48,005 --> 00:39:50,308
if any of what you said was
actually factual, so...

1139
00:39:50,309 --> 00:39:52,109
Well, you can just tell
the judge you fucked up.

1140
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:55,613
I w... I... I... I didn't,
eh, I did not "F" up.

1141
00:39:55,614 --> 00:39:57,147
Listen, don't get your
panties in a wad.

1142
00:39:57,148 --> 00:39:58,583
Just... They're not
wadded, I'm just... my...

1143
00:39:58,584 --> 00:40:00,351
I'm intuitive, I
say what I feel.

1144
00:40:00,352 --> 00:40:01,986
I'm usually right. Oh.

1145
00:40:01,987 --> 00:40:04,387
Take it or leave it. Oh, I
didn't, I did not know.

1146
00:40:05,858 --> 00:40:07,693
Okay.

1147
00:40:07,694 --> 00:40:09,461
Hey, say hi to Tommy.

1148
00:40:09,462 --> 00:40:10,729
It's Tommy.

1149
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:11,864
All right, there's our guy.

1150
00:40:11,865 --> 00:40:13,630
I... I see him as well.

1157

We got to get past

We're not gonna have to,

1159
00:40:47,101 --> 00:40:48,468
'cause he's gonna come to us.

1160
00:40:48,469 --> 00:40:49,736
Come on. What?

1161
00:40:49,737 --> 00:40:52,238
Excuse me! Step aside, please.

1162
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:53,673
All right.

1163
00:40:53,674 --> 00:40:54,808
This is, this is
gonna go fast.

1164
00:40:54,809 --> 00:40:56,143
When I, when I pull the alarm,

1165
00:40:56,144 --> 00:40:57,844
the crowds are gonna head
towards the two exits.

1166
00:40:57,845 --> 00:40:59,279
He's gonna head towards
the nearest one,

1167
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,014
which is northeast, I will
bump into him in the crowd.

1168
00:41:01,015 --> 00:41:02,949
I will grab the cell, place
the bug within the phone,

1169
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:04,685
tell him he dropped his phone.

1170
00:41:04,686 --> 00:41:07,154
It's, it's, uh, something I
like to call a "cop drop."

1171
00:41:07,155 --> 00:41:09,556
Yeah. Got it.
Okay, here we go.

1172
00:41:12,625 --> 00:41:15,329
My God, there are absolutely no
wires attached to this thing.

1173
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:16,864
Now, what is that? What,
is that gum or is that...?

1174
00:41:16,865 --> 00:41:18,499
No, that's Silly Putty?

1175
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,833
I mean, why is it...? Don't
touch it, it's a condom.

1176
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:23,137
All right, he's on the move.

1177
00:41:24,306 --> 00:41:25,774
Okay, we got to get
out there and shake

1178
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:26,775
our asses like the
rest of the foxes.

1179
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:28,375
Ah, oh, yes, yes, yes,

1180
00:41:28,376 --> 00:41:29,944
dancing to get close to him...
that is a fantastic idea.

1181
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:31,078
Okay, here we go.
Jesus, don't do it.

1182
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:33,081
Don't, don't. What?

1183
00:41:33,082 --> 00:41:34,749
What, why are we...? Don't
do anything you're doing.

1184
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:35,984
But, but he's over that way.

1185
00:41:35,985 --> 00:41:37,852
Just... let's go
find a bathroom.

1186
00:41:37,853 --> 00:41:40,789
I told you, I don't have
to use the bathroom.

1187
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,291
Did I ask you about
your bathroom habits?

1188
00:41:42,292 --> 00:41:43,692
You are killing us out there.

1189
00:41:43,693 --> 00:41:44,859
You don't fit in.

1190
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,428
Take off that fucking jacket.

1191
00:41:46,429 --> 00:41:48,330
Well, this is a, this is a good jacket.
This is...

1192
00:41:48,331 --> 00:41:49,864
Really? 'Cause you look like
you're gonna set up a table

1193
00:41:49,865 --> 00:41:51,000
and do their fucking taxes.

1194
00:41:51,001 --> 00:41:52,168
Take off your jacket.

1195
00:41:52,169 --> 00:41:53,502
My God, this is ridiculous...
why...?

1196
00:41:53,503 --> 00:41:55,204
Your shitty jacket? My God.
Shhshh! Zip it.

1197
00:41:55,205 --> 00:41:58,340
Okay, jacket's off,
okay, jacket's off.

1198
00:41:58,341 --> 00:42:01,043
No, no, I can't watch whatever
process is about to happen.

1199
00:42:01,044 --> 00:42:02,044
Now unbutton your buttons.

1200
00:42:02,045 --> 00:42:03,546
I'm a federal agent.

1201
00:42:03,547 --> 00:42:05,281
I don't... Yeah, I know,
and you look like one.

1202
00:42:05,282 --> 00:42:07,016
Oh, God. You think you're
gonna bump into him

1203
00:42:07,017 --> 00:42:08,017
and he's not going to
think something's up?

1204
00:42:08,018 --> 00:42:09,486
Fine, fine, how's that?

1205
00:42:09,487 --> 00:42:11,488
Is that good, is that good? Can we go?
Can we please go?

1206
00:42:11,489 --> 00:42:13,255
I don't know how it's happening.
I think it's getting worse.

1207
00:42:13,256 --> 00:42:15,224
I... my fear is that I'm
gonna put you in a bikini

1208
00:42:15,225 --> 00:42:17,159
and you'll still look like
a fucking bank teller.

1209
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,930
Okay, do you have to use
that language, do you?

1210
00:42:19,931 --> 00:42:21,431
I'm trying to make a point.

1211
00:42:21,432 --> 00:42:23,734
I'm saying your face and
whatever is underneath

1212
00:42:23,735 --> 00:42:26,069
this shitty outfit is maybe
not terrible. Oh, okay.

1213
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:27,437
I'll have you know I
dress appropriately.

1214
00:42:27,438 --> 00:42:29,039
I, I, I like to...

1215
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,208
I got it, I got it.
It's when this...

1216
00:42:31,209 --> 00:42:32,876
your big flapping mouth...

1217
00:42:32,877 --> 00:42:34,578
starts running,
and then you put

1218
00:42:34,579 --> 00:42:38,483
th this getup on top of it,
and it's, it's just a...

1219
00:42:38,484 --> 00:42:40,184
it's a boner killer, and
I'm gonna help you.

1220
00:42:40,185 --> 00:42:42,286
What are you doing, what are
you doing, what are you doing,

1221
00:42:42,287 --> 00:42:43,754
what are you doing? Now, I
just want you to shut up.

1222
00:42:43,755 --> 00:42:45,088
Oh, my God, just...

1223
00:42:45,089 --> 00:42:46,423
Oh, my God. Would you shut up?

1224
00:42:46,424 --> 00:42:48,126
I, I only brought five
of these to Boston.

1225
00:42:48,127 --> 00:42:49,926
Then, I'll, I'll cut
the other four.

1226
00:42:51,063 --> 00:42:52,363
God, that's terrible fabric.

1227
00:42:52,364 --> 00:42:54,298
This was... Just get
that off your wrist.

1228
00:42:54,299 --> 00:42:56,669
This was one of
my favorite ones.

1229
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:57,869
Well...

1230
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:59,303
God, just take it
off, take it off!

1231
00:42:59,304 --> 00:43:01,939
Just give me a second,
I'll take it off!

1232
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:05,443
Okay, I, I look like
I've been attacked.

1233
00:43:05,444 --> 00:43:06,545
That's not my fault.

1234
00:43:06,546 --> 00:43:07,746
What, oh, it's my fault?
I'm gonna...

1235
00:43:07,747 --> 00:43:09,348
Let me even out the bottom.

1236
00:43:09,349 --> 00:43:12,151
Okay, would you just stop
carving up my clothes?! Stop!

1237
00:43:12,152 --> 00:43:13,518
I'm making shorts!

1238
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:14,719
Everybody likes shorts.

1239
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,455
Oh, my word.
Jesus, hold still.

1240
00:43:16,456 --> 00:43:17,523
Oh, please, just...

1241
00:43:17,524 --> 00:43:20,192
W... hey. That feels
awkward, weird.

1242
00:43:20,193 --> 00:43:21,493
Just don't touch that area.

1243
00:43:21,494 --> 00:43:22,828
Well, don't duck down.

1244
00:43:22,829 --> 00:43:24,531
You're gonna suck
my hand up there.

1245
00:43:24,532 --> 00:43:25,965
It's... will you pull...?

1246
00:43:25,966 --> 00:43:28,033
Stop pulling my pants off.

1247
00:43:28,034 --> 00:43:30,369
Jesus. What?

1248
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:31,570
What are those?

1249
00:43:31,571 --> 00:43:32,571
What? What are those?

1250
00:43:32,572 --> 00:43:33,973
Stop, stop it.

1251
00:43:33,974 --> 00:43:36,076
They're my Spanx, they
hold everything together.

1252
00:43:36,077 --> 00:43:39,379
Why, what's gonna f...
come fucking popping out?

1253
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:40,814
Nothing! It just
keeps everything

1254
00:43:40,815 --> 00:43:41,948
where it's supposed
to be, like in...

1255
00:43:41,949 --> 00:43:43,115
Shit, like medically?

1256
00:43:43,116 --> 00:43:46,219
No, no, not
medically, just to...

1257
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:49,122
Uh, just keeps it right
where it's supposed to be.

1258
00:43:49,123 --> 00:43:51,691
You got to, you got
to vent that furnace.

1259
00:43:51,692 --> 00:43:54,028
Okay. That's a lot of
compression and heat.

1260
00:43:54,029 --> 00:43:56,297
It gets plenty of
ventilation, thank you.

1261
00:43:56,298 --> 00:43:57,897
My hand's a foot off and it's on fire.
Okay, okay, well, then

1262
00:43:57,898 --> 00:43:59,032
why don't you cut
these shorts shorter

1263
00:43:59,033 --> 00:44:00,300
because no one can
see my cervix yet?

1264
00:44:00,301 --> 00:44:01,534
Go ahead. I'll
cut 'em shorter.

1265
00:44:01,535 --> 00:44:04,004
No, I'm... stop it,
we're finished.

1266
00:44:04,005 --> 00:44:05,372
Okay, let's just do you now.

1267
00:44:05,373 --> 00:44:07,074
Come on, let's just...
I, I don't need,

1268
00:44:07,075 --> 00:44:09,043
I don't need that to...
What do you mean?

1269
00:44:09,044 --> 00:44:12,481
I put out my sexuality
through motion.

1270
00:44:12,482 --> 00:44:13,948
When this starts
going, it's all...

1271
00:44:13,949 --> 00:44:15,449
You'll get it.

1272
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:18,152
So I have to look like this and
you get to look like that?

1273
00:44:18,153 --> 00:44:19,787
I know, it's not fair.

1274
00:44:19,788 --> 00:44:20,856
Oh, my God.

1275
00:44:20,857 --> 00:44:22,456
We got to tackle the helmet.

1276
00:44:23,658 --> 00:44:26,695
It's got a real...
style memory, huh?

1277
00:44:26,696 --> 00:44:28,896
Shit, you got to... you got
to flip that shit over.

1278
00:44:28,897 --> 00:44:30,298
Bend over. Why?

1279
00:44:30,299 --> 00:44:32,501
You look like Darth Vader.
Just flip it over.

1280
00:44:32,502 --> 00:44:34,770
God Almighty. God, just...

1281
00:44:34,771 --> 00:44:36,938
I gotta just finger tease
the shit out of this.

1282
00:44:36,939 --> 00:44:38,273
You're doing what?
You're finger...?

1283
00:44:38,274 --> 00:44:39,542
I'm going to finger tease it.

1284
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:42,278
What is that? What
does that mean?

1285
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:44,279
Not what you want it to mean.

1286
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:49,018
<i>♪ Now I lay me down ♪
♪ to sleep...? ♪</i>

1287
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:51,020

1288

1289
00:44:52,723 --> 00:44:54,524
What are you looking at?

1290
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:57,393
I like how your friend's shorts
make me feel in my shorts.

1291
00:44:57,394 --> 00:45:00,296
I am sorry, that was much
cruder than I meant it to be.

1292
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:02,031
I stand corrected
on the shorts.

1293
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,733
Let's proceed.

1294
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:05,535
Oh, God, we're dead.

1295
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:06,969
Ah, one o'clock, one o'clock.

1296
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:08,372
Mm, yeah. Let's do this.

1297
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:10,974
All right.

1298
00:45:10,975 --> 00:45:13,810
Get in there, get in there.

1299
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:15,478
How do you, how do you get in?
I don't know how you...

1300
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:17,281
How do you get in? In,
back, back it in.

1301
00:45:17,282 --> 00:45:18,749
Yeah, baby, yeah, let's go.
Get in there. Whoa.

1302
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,818
Get your hands in, get your
hands in and get the phone.

1303
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:21,819
Okay, Pinky. Yuck!

1304
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:23,120
Do the fucking cop drop.

1305
00:45:23,121 --> 00:45:24,721
I'm trying to! Do the
fucking cop drop!

1306
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,958
Oh, baby. I can't do
it from this position!

Okay, coming in one more time.

1310
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:33,964
Get her away, get her away.

00:45:33,965 --> 00:45:35,967
Aah! I got her, I

00:45:35,968 --> 00:45:37,101
You're like a fucking gnat!

get my phone?

Thanks a lot, bro, and
close a couple buttons.

1318
00:45:46,212 --> 00:45:48,046
You Ahole. Ahole! Club policy.
Whoa, Jesus.

1319
00:45:48,047 --> 00:45:49,214
There we go. God bless.

1320
00:45:49,215 --> 00:45:50,582
I got it, I got
the orange one.

1321
00:45:50,583 --> 00:45:52,584
Oh, my God, I need,
I need some water.

00:45:52,585 --> 00:45:54,486
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
My God,

00:45:54,487 --> 00:45:55,888
I will fucking kill you,
I will fucking kill you.

00:46:00,492 --> 00:46:01,860
Jesus, there's
too many of 'em.

1328
00:46:01,861 --> 00:46:03,796
Hey, all right, hi, hi.

1329
00:46:03,797 --> 00:46:06,098
Your moves are weird as shit.
I got it. Aah!

1330
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:07,466
Yeah? You have really soft hair.
And I love it.

1331
00:46:07,467 --> 00:46:09,068
Oh, yeah, oh, it's
the shampoo move.

1332
00:46:09,069 --> 00:46:10,269
Use your boobs.

1333
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:11,670
Oh, yeah, uh, okay.
Use your boobs!

1334
00:46:11,671 --> 00:46:13,505
You see these, see these?
Oh, my God, yeah.

1335
00:46:13,506 --> 00:46:15,307
Yeah, look at 'em, look at 'em.
Oh, my... oh, my God.

Oh, yeah. Shove him in
there, shove him in there.

00:46:18,545 --> 00:46:20,145
I'll get her, I'll get her.
Get her away.

1339
00:46:20,146 --> 00:46:21,747
Hey, what is this?

1340
00:46:21,748 --> 00:46:22,849
What's going on, girl?

1341
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:23,850
Whoa, yeah!

1342
00:46:23,851 --> 00:46:25,252
No. There we go.

1343
00:46:25,253 --> 00:46:27,220
Dave! Oh, God, back it in.
Am I in, am I in?

1344
00:46:27,221 --> 00:46:28,687
Get in there, get in there.
Whoa, please.

1345
00:46:28,688 --> 00:46:30,389
Hi. Hi.

1346
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:31,958
You know, you're the
first chick over 40

1347
00:46:31,959 --> 00:46:33,260
to give me a boner.

1348
00:46:33,261 --> 00:46:35,829
Great, great.

1349
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:36,930
Want to go get a drink?

1350
00:46:36,931 --> 00:46:38,831
Okay, yeah.

1351
00:46:40,901 --> 00:46:43,204
Maybe, maybe.

1352
00:46:43,205 --> 00:46:45,272
It's the only reason girls
hit on me, I think.

1353
00:46:45,273 --> 00:46:46,673
Oh, sorry, yeah. You know?

1354
00:46:46,674 --> 00:46:48,008
'Cause every night,
the hottest chicks...

1355
00:46:48,009 --> 00:46:49,142
they come in here,
they're like,

1356
00:46:49,143 --> 00:46:50,443
"Hey, there's LeSoire."

1357
00:46:50,444 --> 00:46:52,847
Short skirts, too much
makeup, just looking

1358
00:46:52,848 --> 00:46:54,982
like fucking gremlins, right?
Oh, I hate that.

1359
00:46:54,983 --> 00:46:57,251
Don't feed 'em, don't feed
'em after midnight, right?

1360
00:46:57,252 --> 00:46:59,119
Yeah. They turn
into more sluts.

1361
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,354
Fuck it.

1362
00:47:00,355 --> 00:47:02,256
Give me a whiskey.

1363
00:47:02,257 --> 00:47:03,824
I just noticed that
lion, that lion.

1364
00:47:03,825 --> 00:47:06,394
It's just... that is amazing.
Fuck, who the fuck keeps

1365
00:47:06,395 --> 00:47:08,362
putting lions in the back?

1366
00:47:08,363 --> 00:47:09,932
Fourteen dollars.

1367
00:47:09,933 --> 00:47:11,399
Fourteen dollars?!

1368
00:47:12,334 --> 00:47:14,101
I Is it magic fucking whiskey?

1369
00:47:14,102 --> 00:47:15,603
Do, do I get a
motorcycle with it?

1370
00:47:15,604 --> 00:47:17,939
Is it gonna be served
in Jesus' shoe?

1371
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:19,074
Can I sit on your lap?

1372
00:47:19,075 --> 00:47:20,409
Obviously. Okay, all right.

1373
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:21,944
Yeah, let's... I like
where this is going.

1374
00:47:21,945 --> 00:47:23,111
Me, too, Me, too.

1375
00:47:23,112 --> 00:47:24,413
I love foam. My
nephew knows Seal.

1376
00:47:24,414 --> 00:47:26,281
Trying to get Seal
to come up in here.

1377
00:47:26,282 --> 00:47:27,582
Oh! I would love to, oh!

1378
00:47:27,583 --> 00:47:28,884
We're having a, uh...

1379
00:47:28,885 --> 00:47:30,085
Yeah? big foam party later.

1380
00:47:30,086 --> 00:47:31,420
Oh, I look forward...
Hey, hey!

1381
00:47:31,421 --> 00:47:33,488
Oh, shit... I'm plastered.
So sorry.

1382
00:47:33,489 --> 00:47:35,090
Fuck, get up.

1383
00:47:35,091 --> 00:47:36,358
Let's go. God, I am so sorry.

1384
00:47:36,359 --> 00:47:38,294
Hey! Come on, honey, get up.
Drunk bitch.

1385
00:47:38,295 --> 00:47:39,729
Get her the fuck out of
here, guys, come on.

1386
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:41,264
Oh, God, she holds her
liquor like a fiveyearold.

1387
00:47:41,265 --> 00:47:42,932
I'm so sorry. Let's go.

1388
00:47:42,933 --> 00:47:44,433
I'm sorry. All right,
sweetheart, you're out.

1389
00:47:44,434 --> 00:47:46,234
I'm a pony! Time to go. Sorry.

1390
00:47:46,235 --> 00:47:48,137
I'm a pony! I'm so sorry.

1391
00:47:48,138 --> 00:47:49,973
Get her the fuck out of... yeah,
take her home. Come on, pony,

1392
00:47:49,974 --> 00:47:51,908
let's go. Hey, I got to drive
the school bus tomorrow.

1393
00:47:51,909 --> 00:47:53,943
It's my shift. What the
fuck are you talking about?

1394
00:47:53,944 --> 00:47:55,712
It's my shift! Here we go.

1395
00:47:55,713 --> 00:47:57,514
Come on, sweetheart, go. I
didn't get your number.

1396
00:47:57,515 --> 00:47:59,848
It's 21... 22... I'll
find you, I'll find you.

1397
00:48:11,562 --> 00:48:13,696
Oh, pretty nice, right? Wooh.

1398
00:48:13,697 --> 00:48:15,966
I have to say, that
was pretty awesome.

1399
00:48:15,967 --> 00:48:17,234
It really was, man.

1400
00:48:17,235 --> 00:48:18,502
Put 'er there. Put 'er there.

1401
00:48:18,503 --> 00:48:19,970
Yeah... no, put
'er, put 'er there.

1402
00:48:19,971 --> 00:48:21,405
Oh.

1403
00:48:21,406 --> 00:48:22,673
Aah! Don't do that.

1404
00:48:22,674 --> 00:48:25,377
What? You just make it odd.

1405
00:48:25,378 --> 00:48:26,444
I'm trying so hard not
to lash out at you,

1406
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:28,046
and you make it

1407
00:48:28,047 --> 00:48:29,612
really fucking impossible.

1408
00:48:31,449 --> 00:48:33,116
What was that about?
We got company.

1409
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:35,286
Oh, shit.

1410
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,821
Hold on,

1411
00:48:36,822 --> 00:48:38,790
I can lose 'em. Do you
want me to take the wheel?

1412
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:40,625
No, I was a precision
driver at Quantico.

1413
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:42,626
They thought I was the
instructor, I was that good.

1414
00:48:46,032 --> 00:48:47,031
Oh, shoot.

1415
00:48:49,168 --> 00:48:52,503
Lose 'em! I'm... What do you
think I'm trying to do?

1416
00:48:55,708 --> 00:48:57,742
Let me steer it, I... Stop
it, stop it, I got it.

1417
00:49:00,845 --> 00:49:02,680
Hold on.

1418
00:49:12,927 --> 00:49:14,460
Ha!

1419
00:49:14,461 --> 00:49:17,129
And that, that is how
you lose a tail.

1420
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:19,065
Nicely done. Yes.

1421
00:49:19,066 --> 00:49:21,101
I'm surprised.

1422
00:49:21,102 --> 00:49:22,736
Our friends are back.

1423
00:49:22,737 --> 00:49:24,604
I got it, I got it, I got it, tag out.
What are you doing?

1424
00:49:24,605 --> 00:49:26,206
I'll show you how I stop a tail.
What are you doing?

1425
00:49:26,207 --> 00:49:27,207
Just tell me what
you're doing.

1426
00:49:27,208 --> 00:49:28,807
Watch out!

1427
00:49:29,976 --> 00:49:31,143
Aah!

1428
00:49:32,746 --> 00:49:34,815
FBI! Drop your weapon!
Oh, my God.

1429
00:49:34,816 --> 00:49:36,883
What the hell is that?
I don't know.

1430
00:49:36,884 --> 00:49:39,219
Special Agent Garrett, DEA!
Drop it!

1431
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:41,355
No, seriously, what
the fuck are you?

1432
00:49:41,356 --> 00:49:42,623
What are you, fucking deaf?
I just told you.

1433
00:49:42,624 --> 00:49:45,691
DEA. Drop your fucking gun!
Now!

1434
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:49,630
Shit.

1435
00:49:49,631 --> 00:49:51,532
I'm, I'm very sorry
about earlier.

1436
00:49:51,533 --> 00:49:53,901
I just thought you
were an assassin

1437
00:49:53,902 --> 00:49:55,636
'cause of your weapon.

1438
00:49:55,637 --> 00:49:57,205
And because you
look evil as shit.

1439
00:49:57,206 --> 00:49:58,640
Yeah, I get it, all right?

1440
00:49:58,641 --> 00:50:00,808
I'm an albino, so I look
like a bad guy, right?

1441
00:50:00,809 --> 00:50:02,243
No, no, that's not... Yeah.

1442
00:50:02,244 --> 00:50:03,478
That's not what we were...
Yeah.

1443
00:50:03,479 --> 00:50:04,846
Yeah, well, I'm DEA. Hmm.

1444
00:50:04,847 --> 00:50:06,380
And let me tell you something.

1445
00:50:06,381 --> 00:50:07,783
Two months we been
sitting on that club,

1446
00:50:07,784 --> 00:50:09,184
and then you two come
in here one night

1447
00:50:09,185 --> 00:50:10,686
like a couple of
fucking amateurs,

1448
00:50:10,687 --> 00:50:12,421
and you almost blow the whole thing!
All right,

1449
00:50:12,422 --> 00:50:14,722
obviously you have no idea
who you're speaking with.

1450
00:50:14,723 --> 00:50:16,224
I'm Federal Agent
Sarah Ashburn...

1451
00:50:16,225 --> 00:50:17,726
Yes, I am sure your
credentials are

1452
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:21,296
quite impressive, as is your
choice of wardrobe there.

1453
00:50:21,297 --> 00:50:22,564
Nice hot pants. You
might want to try

1454
00:50:22,565 --> 00:50:24,066
shshaving above the
knee next time.

1455
00:50:24,067 --> 00:50:26,101
Are you giving beauty tips?

1456
00:50:26,102 --> 00:50:27,437
Do you own a fucking mirror?

1457
00:50:27,438 --> 00:50:28,638
Listen to me, all right?

1458
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:30,272
This whole "female
professionals"

1459
00:50:30,273 --> 00:50:32,274
"in the workplace" thing, man,
I'm fine with it, all right?

1460
00:50:32,275 --> 00:50:35,611
But here's the problem, all due
respect, with you people...

1461
00:50:35,612 --> 00:50:36,679
is that you get all excited,

1462
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,281
you let your
emotions take over,

1463
00:50:38,282 --> 00:50:40,517
your hormones kick in, you're
riding the cotton pony.

1464
00:50:40,518 --> 00:50:42,552
The next thing you know, you're
complimenting the bad guy

1465
00:50:42,553 --> 00:50:44,186
on his fucking couch!

1466
00:50:44,187 --> 00:50:46,689
Oh, well, all due respect
to you, who's your wife,

1467
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:48,591
a fivepound bag of flour
with a hole in it?

1468
00:50:48,592 --> 00:50:50,360
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
listen, ma'ams,

1469
00:50:50,361 --> 00:50:52,762
we've been cramped inside this
van for two months, all right,

1470
00:50:52,763 --> 00:50:54,465
and we're not gonna let you
swoop in from out of nowhere

1471
00:50:54,466 --> 00:50:56,000
and take all the credit.

1472
00:50:56,001 --> 00:50:58,536
I don't want to see you two
anywhere near this case.

1473
00:50:58,537 --> 00:51:00,737
We have got informants
everywhere.

1474
00:51:00,738 --> 00:51:02,305
We've got surveillance
everywhere.

1475
00:51:02,306 --> 00:51:03,773
We do not need the two of you

1476
00:51:03,774 --> 00:51:06,510
coming in with your estrogen
flying at full speed,

1477
00:51:06,511 --> 00:51:08,412
sticking out in the
middle of broad daylight,

1478
00:51:08,413 --> 00:51:09,747
fucking things up for us.

1479
00:51:09,748 --> 00:51:11,348
'Cause the two of
us are gonna bring

1480
00:51:11,349 --> 00:51:12,949
these guys in. Shit.

1481
00:51:14,019 --> 00:51:15,686
Fuck you, chalk balls.

1482
00:51:15,687 --> 00:51:17,620
Not even on your
birthday, sweetheart.

1483
00:51:18,522 --> 00:51:20,424
That's right, keep walking.

1484
00:51:20,425 --> 00:51:23,128
This isn't over.

1485
00:51:23,129 --> 00:51:24,496
Okay?

1486
00:51:24,497 --> 00:51:26,198
And FYI, women were b...
we were born

1487
00:51:26,199 --> 00:51:28,199
with hair on our legs. Yeah.

1488
00:51:31,268 --> 00:51:33,572
You don't have to stop.

1489
00:51:33,573 --> 00:51:34,773
Well, what are you doing?

1490
00:51:34,774 --> 00:51:36,106
Whoawhoawhoawhoa whoawhoawhoa!

1491
00:51:37,442 --> 00:51:39,610
Get...

1492
00:51:40,946 --> 00:51:43,316
Okay, do you want to tell me
what was wrong back there?

1493
00:51:43,317 --> 00:51:46,451
Nothing. I saw your face when you
were looking at the footage.

1494
00:51:46,452 --> 00:51:48,653
It looked like you saw
someone you knew.

1495
00:51:48,654 --> 00:51:51,390
Possibly your brother?

1496
00:51:51,391 --> 00:51:54,627
You did not read that
from my fucking face.

1497
00:51:54,628 --> 00:51:55,928
You read my file, didn't you?

1498
00:51:55,929 --> 00:51:57,430
God, you're an asshole.
Okay, yes,

1499
00:51:57,431 --> 00:51:59,164
I read your file, but
it is my job to know

1500
00:51:59,165 --> 00:52:02,068
everything about a case,
including who I work with.

1501
00:52:02,069 --> 00:52:03,236
I don't like that.

1502
00:52:03,237 --> 00:52:05,972
We should talk
to him tomorrow.

1503
00:52:05,973 --> 00:52:07,840
Where is he?

1504
00:52:07,841 --> 00:52:09,743
Probably at my parents'.

1505
00:52:09,744 --> 00:52:12,045
Well, then, let's go
to your parents'.

1506
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:15,414
I can't... no, I can't
go to my parents'. Why?

1507
00:52:15,415 --> 00:52:17,949
I'm the one that
put him in jail.

1508
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:21,621
Okay, never mind.

1509
00:52:22,589 --> 00:52:25,359
It's not like I
liked doing it.

1510
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:28,563
You know, he got mixed up with
a lot of really bad people

1511
00:52:28,564 --> 00:52:31,665
and then he started... he
started using that shit,

1512
00:52:31,666 --> 00:52:33,734
and I just had to get
him out of there.

1513
00:52:33,735 --> 00:52:37,371
You know, iironically, a lot
of people become addicted

1514
00:52:37,372 --> 00:52:38,673
when they're in... in prison.

1515
00:52:38,674 --> 00:52:39,941
I think it's like 80,

1516
00:52:39,942 --> 00:52:43,444
85% of the inmates
require treatment.

1517
00:52:43,445 --> 00:52:45,245
I hate you.

1518
00:52:45,246 --> 00:52:46,847
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.

1519
00:52:46,848 --> 00:52:48,783
But I... you know, I
actually wasn't finished.

1520
00:52:48,784 --> 00:52:50,384
I was going to say...

1521
00:52:53,254 --> 00:52:56,724
Why can't you just be quiet?

1522
00:53:39,235 --> 00:53:40,437
What the "F"?

1523
00:53:40,438 --> 00:53:42,706
These are cloth, they're nice.

1524
00:53:42,707 --> 00:53:44,607
I could have shot you.
Oh, I'm sorry,

1525
00:53:44,608 --> 00:53:47,410
do you not like someone
invading your privacy?

1526
00:53:47,411 --> 00:53:48,578
Oh, come on.

1527
00:53:48,579 --> 00:53:50,347
I, I glanced at your file.

1528
00:53:50,348 --> 00:53:51,948
You broke into my home.

1529
00:53:51,949 --> 00:53:54,385
I care about who I'm
working with, too,

1530
00:53:54,386 --> 00:53:56,554
and it's a little
uncomfortable

1531
00:53:56,555 --> 00:53:58,322
that you feel the need
to travel with trophies.

1532
00:53:58,323 --> 00:54:00,123
Okay, well, it's, it's
not what you think.

1533
00:54:00,124 --> 00:54:02,660
They moved me up here, they
rented this apartment, and,

1534
00:54:02,661 --> 00:54:03,894
and this is all my stuff.

1535
00:54:03,895 --> 00:54:06,163
These four shitty, sad boxes...
this is it?

1536
00:54:06,164 --> 00:54:08,065
This is your life?

1537
00:54:08,066 --> 00:54:09,266
Yes.

1538
00:54:09,267 --> 00:54:11,135
Oh, God.

1539
00:54:11,136 --> 00:54:13,305
I don't think that could be any
sadder if you threw it all

1540
00:54:13,306 --> 00:54:15,206
in the trash bag and started
dragging it behind you.

1541
00:54:15,207 --> 00:54:16,707
Oh, my word, you,

1542
00:54:16,708 --> 00:54:19,710
you use coffee filters for
toilet paper at your house.

1543
00:54:19,711 --> 00:54:21,780
I'm buying 'em anyway,
They have a dual purpose.

1544
00:54:21,781 --> 00:54:23,582
That's not what they're for.
Yeah, real fancypants.

1545
00:54:23,583 --> 00:54:26,718
I see it, I see it in here.

1546
00:54:26,719 --> 00:54:28,854
Looks like you were pretty
cool in high school, huh?

1547
00:54:28,855 --> 00:54:31,456
Yes, yes, III
was, but what...?

1548
00:54:31,457 --> 00:54:33,125
Because you weren't.

1549
00:54:33,126 --> 00:54:35,360
You know what that girl's not?
That girl's not cool.

1550
00:54:35,361 --> 00:54:38,163
My favorite part is, you
only have two signatures,

1551
00:54:38,164 --> 00:54:39,532
both by teachers.

1552
00:54:39,533 --> 00:54:42,435
Mrs. Burke said, "Have
a good summer."

1553
00:54:42,436 --> 00:54:43,603
That's a personal touch.

1554
00:54:43,604 --> 00:54:45,904
And then my real
favorite is this one.

1555
00:54:45,905 --> 00:54:48,540
"It'll get better."

1556
00:54:48,541 --> 00:54:50,443
Yes, fine.

1557
00:54:50,444 --> 00:54:52,478
Okay, now we're even.

1558
00:54:52,479 --> 00:54:54,714
Okay.

1559
00:54:54,715 --> 00:54:55,947
I see you have a cat.

1560
00:54:57,316 --> 00:54:59,119
Yep.

1561
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,421
Is he around? 'Cause
I'd kind of like to,

1562
00:55:01,422 --> 00:55:02,922
you know, pet him and stuff.

1563
00:55:02,923 --> 00:55:06,992
He ran away, uh, when
I was in New York.

1564
00:55:11,165 --> 00:55:14,067
Oh, God, that kind
of tears me up.

1565
00:55:14,068 --> 00:55:16,536
Yeah, it was, um, it was a loss.

1566
00:55:16,537 --> 00:55:18,872
That cat got one look
at your shitty life

1567
00:55:18,873 --> 00:55:22,609
and said, "No fucking
thanks, man.

1568
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:24,478
I am out of here."

1569
00:55:24,479 --> 00:55:25,879
I'm still

1570
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,116
kind of just grieving a
little bit about it.

1571
00:55:28,117 --> 00:55:32,352
That fucking tabby is an
asshole, that's what he is.

1572
00:55:32,353 --> 00:55:33,854
Fuck you.

1573
00:55:33,855 --> 00:55:36,691
Fuck you... that's what
I say to that cat.

1574
00:55:36,692 --> 00:55:38,025
Goddamn it.

1575
00:55:42,063 --> 00:55:44,666
Oh. Such a shitty,
shitty little life.

1576
00:55:44,667 --> 00:55:47,769
Even the... you can't
even keep a cat.

1577
00:55:47,770 --> 00:55:49,671
Ah, you know, that just
hurts a little bit.

1578
00:55:49,672 --> 00:55:51,906
That's just the grief.
No, not the grief.

1579
00:55:51,907 --> 00:55:53,441
It's just the, the pounding
a little bit, just...

1580
00:55:53,442 --> 00:55:54,877
Oh.

1581
00:55:54,878 --> 00:55:56,846
All right, well, don't be
a dick about it, but...

1582
00:55:56,847 --> 00:55:58,147
Well, thank you for that.
That was...

1583
00:55:58,148 --> 00:56:01,249
All right, let's hit
the road, okay?

1584
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:02,784
I gotta change.

1585
00:56:02,785 --> 00:56:05,287
What's the matter
with your pantsuit?

1586
00:56:05,288 --> 00:56:07,156
It's, it's pajamas.

1587
00:56:07,157 --> 00:56:08,891
Well, excuse the
shit out of me.

1588
00:56:08,892 --> 00:56:11,861
I didn't realize you
slept in a fucking tux.

1589
00:56:11,862 --> 00:56:14,063
W... Go ahead, get
your top hat.

1590
00:56:26,810 --> 00:56:28,878
You could get a
girlfriend and get a job.

1591
00:56:30,714 --> 00:56:32,315
You don't swear at me.

1592
00:56:32,316 --> 00:56:34,084
This is the place
where you're supposed

1593
00:56:34,085 --> 00:56:35,485
to be civilized. Okay,
stop yelling at everybody.

1594
00:56:35,486 --> 00:56:37,120
Okay? For once in your life,

1595
00:56:37,121 --> 00:56:38,421
be a mother. I don't know
why your whole family

1596
00:56:38,422 --> 00:56:39,789
is jealous of me, then.
Be a mother for once

1597
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:40,924
in your life, just...
Some chicken?

1598
00:56:40,925 --> 00:56:43,127
Oh, great, this asshole.

1599
00:56:43,128 --> 00:56:44,795
All right, just take it easy.

1600
00:56:44,796 --> 00:56:45,862
Hey, Pop.

1601
00:56:45,863 --> 00:56:47,097
Hey, pork chop.

1602
00:56:47,098 --> 00:56:49,799
Ah, well, well, well,
look who it is.

1603
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,269
Yeah, the rat's back in the house.
Nice.

1604
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:52,737
What, did you come back
to arrest somebody else?

1605
00:56:52,738 --> 00:56:54,238
Hey, you know, I saw Ma threw

1606
00:56:54,239 --> 00:56:55,940
a can of, uh, Diet Coke in
the garbage the other day.

1607
00:56:55,941 --> 00:56:57,174
She didn't even recycle it.

1608
00:56:57,175 --> 00:57:00,010
Dad here... he's splicing cable

1609
00:57:00,011 --> 00:57:02,146
off the neighbors next door.
Hey, come on, now, Mark.

1610
00:57:02,147 --> 00:57:03,748
Maybe you should start
fingerprinting him, huh?

1611
00:57:03,749 --> 00:57:06,017
That'd be a good call, and maybe
get yourself some stripes?

1612
00:57:06,018 --> 00:57:07,485
Petey over here, how
many, how many songs

1613
00:57:07,486 --> 00:57:10,022
you download illegally off
the Internet... 5,000?

1614
00:57:10,023 --> 00:57:11,924
Ten, 20,000. 20,000.

1615
00:57:11,925 --> 00:57:13,058
Mikey stole a laptop

1616
00:57:13,059 --> 00:57:14,326
from his work the other day.

1617
00:57:14,327 --> 00:57:15,793
Stole? I fucking worked
there for six weeks.

1618
00:57:15,794 --> 00:57:16,827
I deserved to fucking take it.

1619
00:57:16,828 --> 00:57:17,828
Exactly... no health insurance.

1620
00:57:17,829 --> 00:57:19,598
That balances out, but not you.

1621
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:21,600
You'll probably call in the
fucking SWAT team, won't you?

1622
00:57:21,601 --> 00:57:22,801
Uh, actually she could,

1623
00:57:22,802 --> 00:57:24,202
'cause these are
horrible examples.

1624
00:57:24,203 --> 00:57:27,638
Here are the nuggies.
All right, here we go.

1625
00:57:29,509 --> 00:57:34,112
What kind of an animal throws
her own brother in jail?

1626
00:57:34,113 --> 00:57:35,314
This kind of animal,
right here.

1627
00:57:35,315 --> 00:57:36,348
Shut up, shut up.

1628
00:57:36,349 --> 00:57:37,984
How about keeps him
from killing himself?

1629
00:57:37,985 --> 00:57:39,719
I was the only one that
got him off the street.

1630
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:41,120
None of you fucks did.

1631
00:57:41,121 --> 00:57:43,723
You should never
arrest your family.

1632
00:57:43,724 --> 00:57:45,624
Who the fuck are you?
That's Gina.

1633
00:57:45,625 --> 00:57:47,594
Well, tell Gina I'm going to
strangle her at the table.

1634
00:57:47,595 --> 00:57:48,895
Hey, she is my best friend.

1635
00:57:48,896 --> 00:57:49,929
You touch her, you got
to go through me first.

1636
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:51,564
Who the fuck are you?

1637
00:57:51,565 --> 00:57:54,000
I'll kill you and kill her
with your fucking dead body!

1638
00:57:54,001 --> 00:57:55,468
Okay, everybody calm down.

1639
00:57:55,469 --> 00:57:56,971
Shannon's right.

1640
00:57:56,972 --> 00:57:59,006
This one has no business
chiming in on a family matter.

1641
00:57:59,007 --> 00:58:00,040
"This one"? What,
why are you talking

1642
00:58:00,041 --> 00:58:01,040
about my girlfriend like that?

1643
00:58:01,041 --> 00:58:02,408
She wears sweatpants

1644
00:58:02,409 --> 00:58:03,676
to your mother's
dinner, that's why.

1645
00:58:03,677 --> 00:58:04,978
Those are her
classy sweatpants.

1646
00:58:04,979 --> 00:58:06,146
They don't say "Insert
Here" on the ass.

1647
00:58:06,147 --> 00:58:07,514
Her ass is hanging out!

1648
00:58:07,515 --> 00:58:10,416
Look at her, look at her
breasts at the table!

1649
00:58:13,488 --> 00:58:14,488
Welcome home.

1650
00:58:14,489 --> 00:58:15,823
Hey.

1651
00:58:15,824 --> 00:58:18,759
What, you here to arrest me?
I hope not.

1652
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,961
You selling Bibles?

1653
00:58:20,962 --> 00:58:22,963
No, she's... Ashburn.

1654
00:58:22,964 --> 00:58:24,566
Let's go, let's go.

1655
00:58:24,567 --> 00:58:25,867
We need to talk. Go.

1656
00:58:25,868 --> 00:58:27,602
Sit down.

1657
00:58:27,603 --> 00:58:28,769
Really?

1658
00:58:34,876 --> 00:58:36,878
Okay, enough,
enough, all right?

1659
00:58:36,879 --> 00:58:38,045
Get your hands off me.

1660
00:58:41,182 --> 00:58:43,352
Uh, that is, uh,
that's one of the,

1661
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:46,888
uh, better Jesus sportsthemed
paintings I've seen.

1662
00:58:46,889 --> 00:58:50,191
That's very good, nice.

1663
00:58:50,192 --> 00:58:51,593
What are you doing
at Club Ekko?

1664
00:58:51,594 --> 00:58:53,162
What are you, my mother?
What, were you following me?

1665
00:58:53,163 --> 00:58:54,463
How do you know I was there?

1666
00:58:54,464 --> 00:58:56,465
'Cause I know
everything, that's why.

1667
00:58:56,466 --> 00:58:58,300
Are you already working
for those guys again?

1668
00:58:58,301 --> 00:59:00,368
No, no, this guy Julian...
he sent for me

1669
00:59:00,369 --> 00:59:02,004
because he wants me to
start working for him,

1670
00:59:02,005 --> 00:59:03,472
but I told him, "No",

1671
00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:05,207
"I'm getting a straight
job," and it's fine.

1672
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,542
We're... everybody's cool now.

1673
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,811
Wewe... parted amicably.

1674
00:59:08,812 --> 00:59:10,346
Are you a "knock"?

1675
00:59:10,347 --> 00:59:12,482
I'm sorry? Are you a knock?

1676
00:59:12,483 --> 00:59:14,951
A knock. I d... I'm sorry,
I don't know what that is.

1677
00:59:14,952 --> 00:59:16,819
A knock. A knock.

1678
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:18,487
Am I speaking fucking Japanese?

1679
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:19,755
Yeah, listen to him.

1680
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:21,158
I'm gonna sound
it out for you.

1681
00:59:21,159 --> 00:59:26,296
Are you or are you not...

1682
00:59:26,297 --> 00:59:27,330
a knock?

1683
00:59:27,331 --> 00:59:28,365
A fucking knock.

1684
00:59:28,366 --> 00:59:30,334
<i>Like Johnny Depp
in 21 Jump Street.</i>

1685
00:59:30,335 --> 00:59:33,036
Ah, I see, I see,
okay, aa narc.

1686
00:59:33,037 --> 00:59:34,271
A knock, yes. Ah, yes, yes...
no, I...

1687
00:59:34,272 --> 00:59:35,639
What are you...
what was I saying?

1688
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,274
I was missing the "R"
when you were saying...

1689
00:59:37,275 --> 00:59:38,909
I heard "knock", but
apparently there's a "C."

1690
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:40,311
He said, he said
"knock." I said,

1691
00:59:40,312 --> 00:59:42,080
I said fucking "knock," right?
Wow.

1692
00:59:42,081 --> 00:59:43,114
Why are you wearing a
longsleeved flannel?

1693
00:59:43,115 --> 00:59:44,549
It's hot out.

1694
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:46,083
Eh, I'm, I'm a little
fluey, I was...

1695
00:59:46,084 --> 00:59:47,350
It's nothing. You
want, you want me

1696
00:59:47,351 --> 00:59:48,819
to break that thumb?
Please don't...

1697
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:49,921
Want me to break that thumb?
No, no, no.

1698
00:59:49,922 --> 00:59:50,922
Mercy, mercy, mercy.

1699
00:59:50,923 --> 00:59:52,090
Straighten that arm.

1700
00:59:52,091 --> 00:59:53,591
Uh, it looks worse than it is.

1701
00:59:53,592 --> 00:59:54,892
Itlt's not a big deal.

1702
00:59:54,893 --> 00:59:56,461
This guy Julian, you know,

1703
00:59:56,462 --> 00:59:58,230
they don't want me to stop
working, they like me.

1704
00:59:58,231 --> 01:00:00,065
You tell me where I can
find Julian right now.

1705
01:00:00,066 --> 01:00:01,065
No, just stay out of it.

1706
01:00:01,066 --> 01:00:02,533
They're fucking maniacs.

1707
01:00:02,534 --> 01:00:04,502
They'll chop you up oor
gun you down or worse.

1708
01:00:04,503 --> 01:00:06,704
Okay, we're... Jason, tell
me what you fucking know.

1709
01:00:06,705 --> 01:00:07,873
I don't know anything.

1710
01:00:07,874 --> 01:00:08,941
I, I... ouch!

1711
01:00:08,942 --> 01:00:10,476
D D DDon't.

1712
01:00:10,477 --> 01:00:13,011
Okay, Sal, Sal Natale.
I'll rip it open.

1713
01:00:13,012 --> 01:00:15,613
Okay, you know Sal Natale?

1714
01:00:15,614 --> 01:00:16,948
Of course I know Sal Natale.

1715
01:00:16,949 --> 01:00:18,484
He was going to steal
this huge shipment

1716
01:00:18,485 --> 01:00:20,486
they got coming in,
so they popped him.

1717
01:00:20,487 --> 01:00:22,020
He's in the trunk of his Caddy

1718
01:00:22,021 --> 01:00:23,255
under the Charles
River Bridge.

1719
01:00:23,256 --> 01:00:24,423
I want you to stay
in this house.

1720
01:00:24,424 --> 01:00:25,824
If I catch you out
of this house,

1721
01:00:25,825 --> 01:00:27,260
I'm gonna hurt you
worse than them.

1722
01:00:27,261 --> 01:00:28,795
What are you, what, what
are you doing here?

1723
01:00:28,796 --> 01:00:30,430
What are you doing? No, I'm
a, I'm a federal agent.

1724
01:00:30,431 --> 01:00:31,630
I'm a special agent, and I...

1725
01:00:31,631 --> 01:00:32,865
Special, like retarded?

1726
01:00:32,866 --> 01:00:34,566
Well, we don't use that word.

1727
01:00:34,567 --> 01:00:38,605
We say "special needs," but
II have a very high IQ.

1728
01:00:38,606 --> 01:00:40,240
Are you a boy or a girl?

1729
01:00:40,241 --> 01:00:41,908
That's a fair question.

1730
01:00:41,909 --> 01:00:43,643
Uh, I'm, I'm female.

1731
01:00:43,644 --> 01:00:45,044
No kidding.

1732
01:00:45,045 --> 01:00:46,613
All woman.

1733
01:00:46,614 --> 01:00:47,614
From the getgo?

1734
01:00:47,615 --> 01:00:48,748
Um... No operation?

1735
01:00:48,749 --> 01:00:49,749
Um...

1736
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:51,351
From birth, yes.

1737
01:00:51,352 --> 01:00:53,586
How you get that close
a shave on your face?

1738
01:00:53,587 --> 01:00:55,189
I need to go, but I'll
be back to, um...

1739
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:56,223
Get back to the airport?
Yeah, nice knowing you.

1740
01:00:56,224 --> 01:00:57,825
To... uh, yeah, thank you.

1741
01:00:57,826 --> 01:01:00,194
Yep, that's Sal Natale, all right.
Hmm.

1742
01:01:00,195 --> 01:01:02,195
Bullet hole through the head.

1743
01:01:02,196 --> 01:01:03,864
That's unusually
civilized for them.

1744
01:01:03,865 --> 01:01:05,299
Oh, they cut out
his tongue, too.

1745
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:06,901
Ah, there you have it.

1746
01:01:06,902 --> 01:01:08,469
They like to send a message.

1747
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:10,805
Did you find the tongue?
Sure. Yeah.

1748
01:01:10,806 --> 01:01:12,239
Shoved it up his anal cavity.

1749
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,441
Mmm. Ooh, that's
a weird message.

1750
01:01:13,442 --> 01:01:15,210
Yeah. The tip of the tongue

1751
01:01:15,211 --> 01:01:17,478
was sticking out of the rectum,
so it made it appear as if

1752
01:01:17,479 --> 01:01:19,914
his buttocks were giving
the police the raspberry.

1753
01:01:19,915 --> 01:01:22,884
Did they draw googly eyes or
anything on his butt cheeks?

1754
01:01:22,885 --> 01:01:24,219
No.

1755
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:27,055
Seems like kind of an
opportunity missed.

1756
01:01:27,056 --> 01:01:28,824
That would have been funny.

1757
01:01:28,825 --> 01:01:31,058
Well, II feel that they were

1758
01:01:31,059 --> 01:01:33,527
just trying to be
tongueincheek.

1759
01:01:35,697 --> 01:01:37,799
God, don't do that.

1760
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:40,534
Uh, where are his belongings?

1761
01:01:42,171 --> 01:01:44,373
Any clues as to where
the body was killed?

1762
01:01:44,374 --> 01:01:46,842
No. We're still looking
for their base camp.

1763
01:01:46,843 --> 01:01:48,510
Well, if there's anything on him

1764
01:01:48,511 --> 01:01:50,678
that will tell us,
I will find it.

1765
01:01:55,384 --> 01:01:57,253
Huh. What is that, coke?

1766
01:01:57,254 --> 01:01:58,287
I don't think so.

1767
01:01:58,288 --> 01:01:59,789
It's more like a coating.

1768
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:01,824
Same traces found on all
the victims' shoes.

1769
01:02:01,825 --> 01:02:02,992
All of them had...

1770
01:02:02,993 --> 01:02:05,194
Epoxy powder coating. Right?

1771
01:02:05,195 --> 01:02:07,263
That's right. Yeah.

1772
01:02:07,264 --> 01:02:09,065
And each sample was made
up of the same ingredient,

1773
01:02:09,066 --> 01:02:10,300
which probably
means that they...

1774
01:02:10,301 --> 01:02:11,768
They were all
killed, same place.

1775
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:12,769
Exactly.

1776
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:14,304
I checked it out. Wow.

1777
01:02:14,305 --> 01:02:16,439
There are three places that
have this kind of powder.

1778
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:19,009
Paint factory. Yes. Yeah.

1779
01:02:19,010 --> 01:02:21,011
I think we all know that.
Well, it's...

1780
01:02:21,012 --> 01:02:22,646
Take a look at this.

1781
01:02:22,647 --> 01:02:25,415
This one right here is
centered in the location...

1782
01:02:25,416 --> 01:02:26,817
Where all four... Where
all four dead...

1783
01:02:26,818 --> 01:02:28,519
bodies were found. Yeah.
dead bodies were found.

1784
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:29,454
Right.

1785
01:02:29,455 --> 01:02:30,488
That's what I thought.

1786
01:02:30,489 --> 01:02:32,022
This one shut down years ago,

1787
01:02:32,023 --> 01:02:34,024
owned by a man by the
name of Leif Sa...

1788
01:02:34,025 --> 01:02:35,465
Saggle... Sagglemint.
Sambertineson?

1789
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:37,829
Samber... Old Sagglemint.

1790
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:39,163
Santino.

1791
01:02:39,164 --> 01:02:41,366
Santino. Santino. Oh, Santino.
Santino.

1792
01:02:41,367 --> 01:02:43,701
Is that a derivative
of Sagglemint?

1793
01:02:43,702 --> 01:02:45,970
Get me the address to
that paint factory ASAP.

1794
01:02:45,971 --> 01:02:49,040
Excuse me, Ashburn? Um, I was
wondering if you would...

1795
01:02:49,041 --> 01:02:50,508
Okay, this is a little awkward.

1796
01:02:50,509 --> 01:02:52,744
Uh, it's nothing
personal, but as a rule,

1797
01:02:52,745 --> 01:02:54,045
I... I make it a point

1798
01:02:54,046 --> 01:02:56,515
not to date my coworkers, so...
thank you.

1799
01:02:56,516 --> 01:02:59,451
I was wondering if you would
not talk to me in that tone.

1800
01:02:59,452 --> 01:03:02,220
Oh. Oh! Yes, of course.

1801
01:03:02,221 --> 01:03:04,222
That's a little different.
Of course, yeah.

1802
01:03:04,223 --> 01:03:05,623
No, I... I wouldn't.
Why would I?

1803
01:03:05,624 --> 01:03:07,459
Why would you, really?
I wouldn't.

1804
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:09,461
Just, we should go to
the paint factory.

1805
01:03:09,462 --> 01:03:11,330
Well, are we clear here?
'Cause I don't...

1806
01:03:11,331 --> 01:03:12,865
It got real awkward
between you guys.

1807
01:03:12,866 --> 01:03:15,034
No, it's... I think
we're all good, right?

1808
01:03:15,035 --> 01:03:16,135
Uh, we're... We're
really good.

1809
01:03:16,136 --> 01:03:17,670
Same page. Yeah.

1810
01:03:17,671 --> 01:03:19,171
'Cause I don't want any bad...
I think we are.

1811
01:03:19,172 --> 01:03:20,472
We're all good, right?
Okay, here we go.

1812
01:03:20,473 --> 01:03:22,341
Let's go to the paint factory.

1813
01:03:22,342 --> 01:03:23,809
She doesn't want
to date coworkers,

1814
01:03:23,810 --> 01:03:25,345
so spread the word. Shut up.

Stop it.

1825
01:04:00,349 --> 01:04:02,183
Just cover me and go right.

1826
01:04:02,184 --> 01:04:03,517
Well, then, say that.

1827
01:04:03,518 --> 01:04:05,986
Stop making me
want to shoot you.

1828
01:04:08,656 --> 01:04:10,558
I don't know what
your problem is,

1829
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:12,461
but we told you...
stay out of the city.

1830
01:04:12,462 --> 01:04:13,929
I don't know what it is.

1831
01:04:13,930 --> 01:04:15,397
Are you, uh... you deaf?

1832
01:04:15,398 --> 01:04:16,664
Shh.

1833
01:04:16,665 --> 01:04:18,666
Do you not, uh... do
you speak English?

1834
01:04:18,667 --> 01:04:21,103
I got to do something
with you, man.

1835
01:04:21,104 --> 01:04:22,204
Look, Julian.

1836
01:04:22,205 --> 01:04:23,672
I'm sorry.

1837
01:04:23,673 --> 01:04:25,807
I'll sell for you guys,
whatever you want me to do.

1838
01:04:25,808 --> 01:04:27,442
I'm just trying to
make some extra money.

1839
01:04:27,443 --> 01:04:30,012
Okay? You can't blame
me for that, right?

1840
01:04:30,013 --> 01:04:31,813
Relax. I totally get it.

1841
01:04:31,814 --> 01:04:33,115
Thank you, man.

1842
01:04:33,116 --> 01:04:34,616
I'm not going to shoot you.

1843
01:04:34,617 --> 01:04:35,550
Okay.

1844
01:04:35,551 --> 01:04:37,185
It's cool, man. Thanks. He is.

1845
01:04:37,186 --> 01:04:39,154
Wait, wait, hold on,
hold on, hold on!

1846
01:04:39,155 --> 01:04:40,356
Shit.

1847
01:04:40,357 --> 01:04:42,125
All right, if...
if we grab Julian,

1848
01:04:42,126 --> 01:04:43,426
I can get into his head

1849
01:04:43,427 --> 01:04:44,994
and we'll have
Larkin by tonight.

1850
01:04:44,995 --> 01:04:46,328
Two against two. I
like those odds.

1851
01:04:46,329 --> 01:04:47,596
I'm going to call for backup.

1852
01:04:47,597 --> 01:04:50,366
It's already here.

1853
01:04:50,367 --> 01:04:52,435
Oh, hey. Shit.

1854
01:04:52,436 --> 01:04:53,603
I was looking for you.

1855
01:04:53,604 --> 01:04:55,204
Um, I forgot to
get your number.

1856
01:04:55,205 --> 01:04:56,639
Cool. Yeah.

1857
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:59,276
Uh, it's 1800
givemeyourfuckingguns.

1858
01:04:59,277 --> 01:05:00,778
That's... that's, uh...

1859
01:05:00,779 --> 01:05:03,145
that's... that's too many numbers.
Okay.

1860
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:07,383
Met these disasters at the
club the other night.

1861
01:05:07,384 --> 01:05:09,386
Now they're both here.

1862
01:05:09,387 --> 01:05:10,988
You think you might
have been bugged?

1863
01:05:10,989 --> 01:05:13,056
Give me a break.

1864
01:05:14,925 --> 01:05:16,491
What the fuck?

1865
01:05:20,931 --> 01:05:22,332
Think you're hot shit?

1866
01:05:22,333 --> 01:05:23,467
Guess what? You guys look

1867
01:05:23,468 --> 01:05:24,935
even older in this lighting.

1868
01:05:24,936 --> 01:05:26,638
Come on. Fuck you.

1869
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:28,406
Fuck you! It's not "fuck me."

1870
01:05:28,407 --> 01:05:30,075
It's "fuck you."

1871
01:05:30,076 --> 01:05:31,409
You know why?

1872
01:05:31,410 --> 01:05:33,643
Because I'm about
to fuck you up.

1873
01:05:37,215 --> 01:05:39,184
Pick it up.

1874
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:40,485
Do it.

1875
01:05:40,486 --> 01:05:42,152
Give me a reason to
shoot you in the face.

1876
01:05:47,325 --> 01:05:48,693
How long is this going to take?

1877
01:05:48,694 --> 01:05:50,328
I don't know. Maybe 12
hours, hopefully less.

1878
01:05:50,329 --> 01:05:52,063
I have... I have to find
out what drives him.

1879
01:05:52,064 --> 01:05:54,032
We could just go in there and
beat him with a phone book.

1880
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:56,202
No, no, no. For so many
reasons, no, okay?

1881
01:05:56,203 --> 01:05:57,770
You just need to be
patient, all right?

1882
01:05:57,771 --> 01:06:00,039
It is crucial... crucial
that you remain patient.

1883
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,739
It's also crucial
that you stop wearing

1884
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:03,508
that stupid barrette. What
are you doing? What...?

1885
01:06:03,509 --> 01:06:05,377
Don't... Just leave it. What
is the problem with this?

1886
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:06,879
I mean, you have
one on your head.

1887
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,914
Yeah, on top of my head,
like a normal person.

1888
01:06:08,915 --> 01:06:11,016
What is the difference?
Just move on.

1889
01:06:11,017 --> 01:06:12,485
Okay, if you enter that room,

1890
01:06:12,486 --> 01:06:14,521
you could break the bond
that we have created, okay?

1891
01:06:14,522 --> 01:06:17,323
Just please, please,
trust me on this one.

1892
01:06:17,324 --> 01:06:19,258
Okay, do you understand
how important this is?

1893
01:06:19,259 --> 01:06:21,594
Yeah, I do.

1894
01:06:21,595 --> 01:06:23,730
And you will be patient?

1895
01:06:23,731 --> 01:06:25,265
I will.

1896
01:06:25,266 --> 01:06:27,733
Okay. All right.

1897
01:06:31,704 --> 01:06:33,038
Hello.

1898
01:06:34,274 --> 01:06:35,408
Coffee?

1899
01:06:35,409 --> 01:06:36,676
I drink a little more coffee

1900
01:06:36,677 --> 01:06:38,745
than I probably should.
I... Aah!

1901
01:06:38,746 --> 01:06:39,546
Oh, my...

1902
01:06:39,547 --> 01:06:40,680
Where's Larkin?

1903
01:06:40,681 --> 01:06:42,150
You couldn't wait ten seconds?

1904
01:06:42,151 --> 01:06:44,085
Ten seconds? What's so funny?

1905
01:06:44,086 --> 01:06:46,487
You thinking you're
going to make me talk.

1906
01:06:46,488 --> 01:06:48,688
Yeah, you're talking
right now, dumb-ass.

1907
01:06:48,689 --> 01:06:50,858
You know, you look like one
of the Campbell's soup kids

1908
01:06:50,859 --> 01:06:52,426
who grew up and
became an alcoholic.

1909
01:06:52,427 --> 01:06:54,128
Oh, surprisingly catty.

1910
01:06:54,129 --> 01:06:55,830
You're a fucking genius.

1911
01:06:55,831 --> 01:06:58,099
I asked you to stay outside.

1912
01:06:58,100 --> 01:06:59,433
I need to go tough on him.

1913
01:06:59,434 --> 01:07:00,802
Oh, uh, are you not
already doing that?

1914
01:07:00,803 --> 01:07:02,303
No. I'm doing good copbad cop.

1915
01:07:02,304 --> 01:07:03,771
You know, I can hear you.

1916
01:07:03,772 --> 01:07:05,038
Shut up.

1917
01:07:06,708 --> 01:07:09,578
Just, please, don't
do anything crazy.

1918
01:07:09,579 --> 01:07:11,446
I'm not going to
do anything crazy.

1919
01:07:11,447 --> 01:07:12,881
What am I going to
do that's crazy?

1920
01:07:12,882 --> 01:07:14,783
I'm a police officer. Huh?
I mean, what, am I

1921
01:07:14,784 --> 01:07:16,718
going to shoot you in the dick?
Oh, my God.

1922
01:07:16,719 --> 01:07:19,688
You said nothing crazy,
and that is a nono.

1923
01:07:19,689 --> 01:07:20,756
Nono!

1924
01:07:20,757 --> 01:07:22,357
Turn around. I need you
to pass a polygraph.

1925
01:07:22,358 --> 01:07:23,959
Put it away. Turn around.

1926
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:25,727
No! Don't worry. She's
not going to do it.

1927
01:07:25,728 --> 01:07:26,929
She's not going
to do anything.

1928
01:07:26,930 --> 01:07:28,298
Oh, okay, so you
want to just...

1929
01:07:28,299 --> 01:07:29,599
you just want to go and gamble

1930
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:30,667
with your scrotum
and your testicles?

1931
01:07:30,668 --> 01:07:31,934
Okay, gamble away.

1932
01:07:31,935 --> 01:07:34,036
Just go to the corner.
I'm in it.

1933
01:07:34,037 --> 01:07:35,537
I'll tell you what
we're going to do.

1934
01:07:35,538 --> 01:07:36,838
We're going to play
a little game.

1935
01:07:36,839 --> 01:07:38,575
Okay? I'm going to take
out these bullets.

1936
01:07:38,576 --> 01:07:41,277
Except for this one, 'cause
this is my favorite.

1937
01:07:41,278 --> 01:07:42,712
I'm going to keep that in there.

1938
01:07:42,713 --> 01:07:44,681
And then you're going to
tell me where Larkin is,

1939
01:07:44,682 --> 01:07:46,815
and you're going to
tell me where and when

1940
01:07:46,816 --> 01:07:49,085
that shipment is
coming in, okay?

1941
01:07:49,086 --> 01:07:51,521
Right now.

1942
01:07:51,522 --> 01:07:54,190
I'm going to kill you
and everyone you know.

1943
01:07:54,191 --> 01:07:55,758
Aah! God, no.

1944
01:07:55,759 --> 01:07:57,828
Yeah, that's not what I
fucking asked you, is it?

1945
01:07:57,829 --> 01:07:59,396
Hey, straight arrow, take the
gun out of this one's hand.

1946
01:07:59,397 --> 01:08:00,831
Oh, now you want me
to save your scrotum?

1947
01:08:00,832 --> 01:08:02,633
When is the shipment coming in?
I don't know.

1948
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:04,367
Hey, hey, all right!

1949
01:08:04,368 --> 01:08:05,535
ThThere's a shipment
on Wednesday.

1950
01:08:05,536 --> 01:08:07,171
Where? II don't know.

1951
01:08:07,172 --> 01:08:08,973
I swear. I swear to
God, I don't know!

1952
01:08:08,974 --> 01:08:10,908
Tell her! Just tell her where it is!
I swear to God!

1953
01:08:10,909 --> 01:08:13,010
I don't know! Jesus Christ,
don't shoot me in the dick!

1954
01:08:13,011 --> 01:08:14,778
I don't know! It's going
to be on Wednesday!

1955
01:08:14,779 --> 01:08:16,047
That's four shots! Don't
take any more shots!

1956
01:08:16,048 --> 01:08:17,114
Don't shoot my dick off!

1957
01:08:17,115 --> 01:08:18,849
No! Just tell her
where it's coming in!

1958
01:08:18,850 --> 01:08:20,517
Honest to God, I don't
know where the drop is!

1959
01:08:20,518 --> 01:08:21,685
Don't shoot me in the dick!

1960
01:08:21,686 --> 01:08:22,853
Hey! Enough! Stop it!
Hey! Hey!

1961
01:08:22,854 --> 01:08:24,054
You brought Julian
and LeSoire in?

1962
01:08:24,055 --> 01:08:25,290
What are you, out of
your fucking minds?

1963
01:08:25,291 --> 01:08:26,491
Wasn't too smart.

1964
01:08:26,492 --> 01:08:27,859
Oh, okay, so you're
not supposed

1965
01:08:27,860 --> 01:08:29,060
to arrest someone when
they commit murder

1966
01:08:29,061 --> 01:08:30,795
and then turn around
and try and kill you

1967
01:08:30,796 --> 01:08:32,029
at the same time?
Yeah, you wanted us

1968
01:08:32,030 --> 01:08:33,464
to keep them on the street?
Yeah.

1969
01:08:33,465 --> 01:08:35,600
You shouldn't even
have been there!

1970
01:08:35,601 --> 01:08:37,335
Larkin is the big catch
here, not those two.

1971
01:08:37,336 --> 01:08:39,271
Now we're never going to be able
to bring these fucking guy...

1972
01:08:39,272 --> 01:08:41,473
Enough. Craig, calm the hell down.
We can all hear you.

1973
01:08:41,474 --> 01:08:42,841
Yeah, dogs can hear you.

1974
01:08:42,842 --> 01:08:44,543
Yeah, of course
dogs can hear me.

1975
01:08:44,544 --> 01:08:45,878
Yep. God, are you okay?

1976
01:08:45,879 --> 01:08:47,545
'Cause you... you
look really pale.

1977
01:08:47,546 --> 01:08:49,047
It's a genetic condition!

1978
01:08:49,048 --> 01:08:50,415
Ashburn, come here.

1979
01:08:50,416 --> 01:08:51,750
Fucking snow cone.

1980
01:08:51,751 --> 01:08:53,719
Oh, I get it.
That's a good one,

1981
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:56,054
'cause I'm really white.

1982
01:08:57,423 --> 01:08:59,825
Can I have a moment
with my agent, please?

1983
01:08:59,826 --> 01:09:02,028
I'm good.

1984
01:09:02,029 --> 01:09:05,665
All right. I'm going to
be right over there.

1985
01:09:05,666 --> 01:09:07,900
Right there.

1986
01:09:07,901 --> 01:09:08,968
Thank you.

1987
01:09:08,969 --> 01:09:10,703
Ashburn, why didn't
you alert anyone

1988
01:09:10,704 --> 01:09:12,439
once you found evidence
on Julian's whereabouts?

1989
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:14,241
Sir, it was an unconfirmed lead.

1990
01:09:14,242 --> 01:09:17,044
I wasn't going to waste anyone's
time until I knew it was real.

1991
01:09:17,045 --> 01:09:18,177
Just give it a rest.

1992
01:09:18,178 --> 01:09:19,345
I want you to stand down

1993
01:09:19,346 --> 01:09:20,579
while I figure out
how to repair

1994
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:21,882
all this shit with the DEA.

1995
01:09:21,883 --> 01:09:23,517
Sir, no, please. I...
I swear, I've...

1996
01:09:23,518 --> 01:09:25,952
I've been doing everything that
you sent me out here to do.

1997
01:09:25,953 --> 01:09:27,454
I... we've been doing
such good work.

1998
01:09:27,455 --> 01:09:29,189
I know. I know you are.

1999
01:09:29,190 --> 01:09:31,326
It's just...

2000
01:09:31,327 --> 01:09:32,826
I don't know, it's...

2001
01:09:32,827 --> 01:09:35,061
never easy when
you are involved.

2002
01:09:43,571 --> 01:09:45,540
Fuck that guy. Yeah, yeah.

2003
01:09:45,541 --> 01:09:48,041
Right? If you're not in trouble,
you're not doing your job.

2004
01:09:48,042 --> 01:09:49,677
Yeah.

2005
01:09:49,678 --> 01:09:51,679
We should go get a drink.

2006
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:53,881
Right? What's the point of
being a cop if you can't

2007
01:09:53,882 --> 01:09:55,416
get one drink at the
end of the night?

2008
01:09:55,417 --> 01:09:56,651
That's what I'm talking about.

2009
01:09:56,652 --> 01:09:58,487
Oh, II said just...
I just want one.

2010
01:09:58,488 --> 01:09:59,655
Yeah, oh, no, no. Here.

2011
01:09:59,656 --> 01:10:01,023
It is one. It is one.

2012
01:10:01,024 --> 01:10:02,990
Sometimes he just... he
likes to do this thing,

2013
01:10:02,991 --> 01:10:05,526
he pours them in three
little glasses,

2014
01:10:05,527 --> 01:10:07,295
but it's one.

2015
01:10:07,296 --> 01:10:09,098
All right. Here we go.

2016
01:10:09,099 --> 01:10:10,432
Fair enough.

2017
01:10:10,433 --> 01:10:11,967
Let's loosen that up.

2018
01:10:11,968 --> 01:10:13,801
Okeydokey.

2019
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:20,609
There you go. There you go.

2020
01:10:20,610 --> 01:10:22,211
Keep a pace. Okay.

2021
01:10:22,212 --> 01:10:24,380
Don't spit that shit out.
It's not free.

2022
01:10:24,381 --> 01:10:25,748
Let's go.

2023
01:10:25,749 --> 01:10:27,984
Keep that in.

2024
01:10:27,985 --> 01:10:28,885
Hey. Ooh.

2025
01:10:28,886 --> 01:10:30,553
Yeah. Hey. How you doing?

2026
01:10:30,554 --> 01:10:32,388
I haven't heard from you.

2027
01:10:32,389 --> 01:10:34,556
Shit.

2028
01:10:34,557 --> 01:10:37,127
No. Yeah, you haven't.

2029
01:10:37,128 --> 01:10:39,461
Well, then, I mean, did I
do something wrong or...?

2030
01:10:41,399 --> 01:10:44,434
Okay, here we go.

2031
01:10:44,435 --> 01:10:46,036
It's not you, It's me.

2032
01:10:46,037 --> 01:10:49,038
Uh, I'm still working on myself,

2033
01:10:49,039 --> 01:10:52,075
so I can't be a part of two
until I'm a better one.

2034
01:10:52,076 --> 01:10:53,743
Okay, don't. You don't
have to do that.

2035
01:10:53,744 --> 01:10:55,045
Uh, wait, I still...
my favorite's coming.

2036
01:10:55,046 --> 01:10:58,849
Oh. You make me want
to be a better woman.

2037
01:10:58,850 --> 01:11:00,584
Okay, you know what? I
thought we had a good time.

2038
01:11:00,585 --> 01:11:02,786
Yeah, I... we did
have a lot of fun.

2039
01:11:02,787 --> 01:11:05,456
And now we're
going to move on.

2040
01:11:05,457 --> 01:11:07,558
Let it go. Okay.

2041
01:11:07,559 --> 01:11:09,760
All right. Cool. All right.

2042
01:11:09,761 --> 01:11:12,062
Hey. Hey, no hard
feelings, all right?

2043
01:11:12,063 --> 01:11:13,397
Oh...

2044
01:11:16,568 --> 01:11:18,535
Okay.

2045
01:11:21,338 --> 01:11:22,573
Okay, hit it.

2046
01:11:22,574 --> 01:11:25,009
Hit it. Okay. Okay.

2047
01:11:26,411 --> 01:11:27,712
Bye. Bye. That's good.

2048
01:11:27,713 --> 01:11:29,614
I don't know how
else to say it.

2049
01:11:29,615 --> 01:11:31,249
It's pretty clear. Yeah.

2050
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:33,618
That's why you don't...
you don't feed strays.

2051
01:11:33,619 --> 01:11:34,619
Yeah.

2052
01:11:34,620 --> 01:11:36,455
Can we get two more?

2053
01:11:36,456 --> 01:11:38,223
Shots?

2054
01:11:38,224 --> 01:11:39,924
Six.

2055
01:11:41,193 --> 01:11:44,596
We should just get one
more of these, right?

2056
01:11:45,966 --> 01:11:47,766
I don't know, Mullins.

2057
01:11:47,767 --> 01:11:49,201
It's hard.

2058
01:11:49,202 --> 01:11:51,003
I know we're not
supposed to say this,

2059
01:11:51,004 --> 01:11:52,705
but being a woman in
this field is hard.

2060
01:11:52,706 --> 01:11:54,173
Well...

2061
01:11:54,174 --> 01:11:58,010
Men are just so intimidated
by me, which is, like, why?

2062
01:11:58,011 --> 01:12:01,281
And then you put your
personality on top of that,

2063
01:12:01,282 --> 01:12:02,715
and it is... Mmhmm.

2064
01:12:02,716 --> 01:12:04,150
It is off putting.

2065
01:12:04,151 --> 01:12:06,385
You know, I was, uh... I was
actually married for...

2066
01:12:06,386 --> 01:12:07,787
for six some years... same guy.

2067
01:12:07,788 --> 01:12:09,756
Was he a hearing man? Yes.

2068
01:12:09,757 --> 01:12:11,859
Yeah, he didn't, uh...
he didn't understand

2069
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:14,061
how much the job meant
to me, so I thought it'd

2070
01:12:14,062 --> 01:12:15,896
probably be best
to just be alone

2071
01:12:15,897 --> 01:12:18,064
rather than to, you know,
compromise the work.

2072
01:12:18,065 --> 01:12:20,234
I get that. Yeah. Yeah.

2073
01:12:20,235 --> 01:12:23,604
It's kind of weird that it
does get lonely a little bit.

2074
01:12:23,605 --> 01:12:25,072
You know, and it's...

2075
01:12:25,073 --> 01:12:26,673
it's hard to make
female friends.

2076
01:12:26,674 --> 01:12:27,908
Yeah.

2077
01:12:27,909 --> 01:12:29,711
I hung out, you know...

2078
01:12:29,712 --> 01:12:31,980
really just with my...
my brothers and stuff

2079
01:12:31,981 --> 01:12:33,580
growing up, and... Yeah.

2080
01:12:33,581 --> 01:12:36,583
They just kind of all turned
out to be terrible people.

2081
01:12:36,584 --> 01:12:38,086
So that's kind of a bummer.

2082
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:40,455
Your f... your family loves you.

2083
01:12:40,456 --> 01:12:41,856
I mean, in their own

2084
01:12:41,857 --> 01:12:43,791
unique... unique way, but they...
you know,

2085
01:12:43,792 --> 01:12:45,226
theythey love you, and
that's a wonderful...

2086
01:12:45,227 --> 01:12:46,294
Very unique.

2087
01:12:46,295 --> 01:12:47,962
That sounds like
it's coming from...

2088
01:12:47,963 --> 01:12:49,163
somebody that's an only child.

2089
01:12:49,164 --> 01:12:50,565
No, I...

2090
01:12:50,566 --> 01:12:53,101
I was actually raised with a
lot of children, so I had...

2091
01:12:53,102 --> 01:12:55,537
With the children?
What, in a circus?

2092
01:12:55,538 --> 01:12:57,673
Uh, no, just in...
in the houses.

2093
01:12:57,674 --> 01:13:00,643
Oh, my God.

2094
01:13:00,644 --> 01:13:03,177
You're a foster kid.

2095
01:13:03,178 --> 01:13:05,013
Yes, I was.

2096
01:13:05,014 --> 01:13:06,615
Oh, my God. Yes.

2097
01:13:06,616 --> 01:13:08,784
No... Jesus, that
clears up a lot.

2098
01:13:08,785 --> 01:13:10,452
Foster... foster kid.
That makes sense.

2099
01:13:10,453 --> 01:13:11,720
That's a tough go of it.

2100
01:13:11,721 --> 01:13:14,089
No, it was totally fine.

2101
01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:15,725
There was a lot of benefits

2102
01:13:15,726 --> 01:13:18,027
Toto being a foster kid.

2103
01:13:18,028 --> 01:13:19,895
Yeah? Yeah, oh, yeah.
You had...

2104
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:22,565
on Christmases, there was
thisthis local drug store

2105
01:13:22,566 --> 01:13:24,500
it would sponsor... sponsor us

2106
01:13:24,501 --> 01:13:28,738
and give us little baggies of,
you know, toiletries, and stuff.

2107
01:13:28,739 --> 01:13:30,173
On Thanksgiving... Oh, shit.

2108
01:13:30,174 --> 01:13:32,609
We would... we would
hit these different

2109
01:13:32,610 --> 01:13:33,977
puttputt golf courses.

2110
01:13:33,978 --> 01:13:36,146
It was, you know, you'd
meet all kinds of

2111
01:13:36,147 --> 01:13:37,347
other kids. Other sad kids?

2112
01:13:37,348 --> 01:13:39,482
Yeah, no. No, no, no.
Oh, Jesus.

2113
01:13:39,483 --> 01:13:44,255
That is the saddest series
of images I've ever heard.

2114
01:13:44,256 --> 01:13:46,023
No, I don't think
it affected me...

2115
01:13:46,024 --> 01:13:48,592
I mean, in the long
run, at all, At all.

2116
01:13:48,593 --> 01:13:50,327
You're probably fine. You
know, I can see how maybe

2117
01:13:50,328 --> 01:13:51,895
it was, you know,
like, a little bit,

2118
01:13:51,896 --> 01:13:54,498
but not anything that's...
A little bit.

2119
01:13:54,499 --> 01:13:55,666
Maybe it has? Maybe it has.

2120
01:13:55,667 --> 01:13:56,834
May...? Oh, God.

2121
01:13:56,835 --> 01:13:58,202
Oh, God, my life. Yeah. Okay.

2122
01:13:58,203 --> 01:13:59,570
Ugh. Oh, God.

2123
01:13:59,571 --> 01:14:02,006
All right. Yep.

2124
01:14:02,007 --> 01:14:03,608
All right. Let it out.

2125
01:14:03,609 --> 01:14:05,209
That's it. Oh, God.

2126
01:14:05,210 --> 01:14:07,011
Good for you to start
working through it.

2127
01:14:07,012 --> 01:14:08,446
I don't feel well.

2128
01:14:08,447 --> 01:14:10,181
Oh, Jesus. I don't feel well.
I don't...

2129
01:14:10,182 --> 01:14:12,050
I... Wow. Well, you're not
making me feel great.

2130
01:14:12,051 --> 01:14:13,518
All right. Get it, get it.

2131
01:14:13,519 --> 01:14:14,953
Blow it out.

2132
01:14:14,954 --> 01:14:16,622
Really let it go.

2133
01:14:16,623 --> 01:14:18,756

You've got more than...

01:14:18,757 --> 01:14:20,291
Oh!

2135
01:14:20,292 --> 01:14:21,226

2230
01:18:08,430 --> 01:18:10,763
All right, let's
see what you got.

2231
01:18:13,434 --> 01:18:14,435
Oh, shit.

2232
01:18:14,436 --> 01:18:16,271
That's great. Good evening.

2233
01:18:16,272 --> 01:18:17,839
That's great.

2234
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:19,173
There you go.

2235
01:18:19,174 --> 01:18:20,541
I didn't think you were

2236
01:18:20,542 --> 01:18:22,343
going to care that much
about your jacket.

2237
01:18:22,344 --> 01:18:24,345
You didn't care at all when
you gave away your car.

2238
01:18:24,346 --> 01:18:25,413
Who did I give it to?

2239
01:18:25,414 --> 01:18:26,648
To Wayne. Who's Wayne?

2240
01:18:26,649 --> 01:18:28,183
Wayne. He just
walked out of here.

2241
01:18:28,184 --> 01:18:29,985
You were sitting on
his lap all night.

2242
01:18:29,986 --> 01:18:31,586
You had your tongue
down his throat.

2243
01:18:31,587 --> 01:18:32,753
What?!

2244
01:18:37,626 --> 01:18:39,261
Oh, God.

2245
01:18:39,262 --> 01:18:40,962
Feels like we've
been hibernating.

2246
01:18:40,963 --> 01:18:42,430
Didn't bother you last night.

2247
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:43,699
Oh, Jesus, ten
missed messages.

2248
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:45,701
Will you just... will
you get him, please?

2249
01:18:45,702 --> 01:18:47,336
Hey, Wayne! Ashburn wants
her underwear back!

2250
01:18:47,337 --> 01:18:48,937
I do not!

2251
01:18:48,938 --> 01:18:50,438
You cannot take that car.

2252
01:18:50,439 --> 01:18:51,840
It's government property.

2253
01:18:51,841 --> 01:18:53,142
Oh, yeah?

2254
01:18:53,143 --> 01:18:55,611
Well, I pay taxes, so
fuck the government!

2255
01:18:55,612 --> 01:18:56,746
Let's not, okay?

2256
01:18:56,747 --> 01:18:58,680
Wayne, get out of the
car, you asshole.

2257
01:19:00,516 --> 01:19:01,616
Oh, God.

2258
01:19:08,658 --> 01:19:09,825
Oh, my God.

2259
01:19:09,826 --> 01:19:11,060
Oh, shit, Wayne.

2260
01:19:11,061 --> 01:19:12,362
Oh, my God.

2261
01:19:12,363 --> 01:19:14,064
God, your first boyfriend.

2262
01:19:14,065 --> 01:19:16,800
You two were electric.

2263
01:19:16,801 --> 01:19:18,368
How did Julian escape?

2264
01:19:18,369 --> 01:19:21,004
Federal marshals transferring
him got ambushed.

2265
01:19:21,005 --> 01:19:23,774
We're not sure whether Larkin's
men followed the marshals

2266
01:19:23,775 --> 01:19:25,909
or if they got information
from the inside.

2267
01:19:25,910 --> 01:19:27,144
Yeah, you don't think
it's a little obvious?

2268
01:19:27,145 --> 01:19:28,378
Oh, fuck you!

2269
01:19:28,379 --> 01:19:29,846
I know when I smell a
fucking albino rat.

2270
01:19:29,847 --> 01:19:31,482
If you want to be pointing
a finger around here,

2271
01:19:31,483 --> 01:19:32,583
why don't you point it
right back at yourself?!

2272
01:19:32,584 --> 01:19:34,084
All right, yeah.
No, because if

2273
01:19:34,085 --> 01:19:35,686
you two hadn't
brought Julian in,

2274
01:19:35,687 --> 01:19:38,288
then Larkin would've never even
known that we were onto him.

2275
01:19:38,289 --> 01:19:39,757
And then this whole
case wouldn't be

2276
01:19:39,758 --> 01:19:42,327
the giant mixedup bucket of
shit that it is right now.

2277
01:19:42,328 --> 01:19:44,595
So fuck you and your
albino prejudice!

2278
01:19:44,596 --> 01:19:47,165
Now Larkin knows who you are,
and Julian's angry as shit.

2279
01:19:47,166 --> 01:19:49,367
If I were you, I would
get out of town.

2280
01:19:49,368 --> 01:19:50,902
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

2281
01:19:50,903 --> 01:19:52,904
Ashburn, he's right.

2282
01:19:52,905 --> 01:19:54,105
This isn't a choice.

2283
01:19:54,106 --> 01:19:55,640
No! No way!

2284
01:19:55,641 --> 01:19:57,542
You're not my boss,
Puss In Boots.

2285
01:19:57,543 --> 01:20:00,079
And even if you were my boss,
you still couldn't stop me.

2286
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:03,048
I have more invested in this
case than any of you assholes.

2287
01:20:03,049 --> 01:20:05,316
And now you fucked it up, didn't you?
Mullins.

2288
01:20:05,317 --> 01:20:06,784
Yep, thanks.

2289
01:20:06,785 --> 01:20:07,987
That's another fuckedup
area of my life.

2290
01:20:07,988 --> 01:20:09,188
Thanks for bringing it up.

2291
01:20:09,189 --> 01:20:10,788
No, this was just
emailed to me.

2292
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:17,597
Okay, fine. I guess
I'm out of line, huh?

2293
01:20:17,598 --> 01:20:20,566
Yeah, I'm gonna step back and
see what you assholes can do.

2294
01:20:20,567 --> 01:20:22,067
Yeah, go USA. Let's go.

2295
01:20:22,068 --> 01:20:23,535
We got to get my
family out of there.

2296
01:20:23,536 --> 01:20:24,670
They're gonna kill them.

2297
01:20:24,671 --> 01:20:25,938
You know, let me
just talk to Hale.

2298
01:20:25,939 --> 01:20:27,507
The FBI can arrange
everything.

2299
01:20:27,508 --> 01:20:29,442
No! Are you kidding? We got
a mole in there somewhere.

2300
01:20:29,443 --> 01:20:30,810
And I'm assuming it's
the fucking albino,

2301
01:20:30,811 --> 01:20:32,379
but we don't know.
Could be Levy.

2302
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:33,813
It could be somebody
from my own precinct.

2303
01:20:33,814 --> 01:20:35,614
It could be your
boss, Puss In Boots.

2304
01:20:35,615 --> 01:20:38,284
We are going in there by
ourselves and doing it now.

2305
01:20:38,285 --> 01:20:40,452
Are you with me or not?

2306
01:20:43,923 --> 01:20:45,359
Okay, okay.

2307
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:47,094
This is bullshit.

2308
01:20:47,095 --> 01:20:49,295
Why should we uproot our lives
'cause you're an asshole?

2309
01:20:49,296 --> 01:20:50,530
Go. Hey, don't talk
to her like that.

2310
01:20:50,531 --> 01:20:51,865
It's not her fault.

2311
01:20:51,866 --> 01:20:53,833
Are you sure you want
to bring everyone?

2312
01:20:53,834 --> 01:20:55,603
<i>No, but it'd be like Schindler's List.
Dad! Come on!</i>

2313
01:20:55,604 --> 01:20:56,904
We cannot fit that in the car!

2314
01:20:56,905 --> 01:20:59,073
I don't want them to take
my treasures. Jesus.

2315
01:20:59,074 --> 01:21:00,608
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I'm
hoping, I'm hoping it's Vegas.

2316
01:21:00,609 --> 01:21:02,043
I thought you were outside.
Say byebye.

2317
01:21:02,044 --> 01:21:03,811
'Cause I'll get my boobs
done if we go there.

2318
01:21:03,812 --> 01:21:05,246
Say byebye. Say byebye. Say byebye.
No, no, no, no.

2319
01:21:05,247 --> 01:21:06,614
I'll call you when I get there.
Ow.

2320
01:21:06,615 --> 01:21:07,915
You are so rude. I know.
I'm so sorry.

2321
01:21:07,916 --> 01:21:09,183
This is my house. Can
you just go outside.

2322
01:21:09,184 --> 01:21:10,251
No, where are you going?
Outside.

2323
01:21:10,252 --> 01:21:11,452
I'll be right there. Outside.

2324
01:21:11,453 --> 01:21:12,753
Holy shit, I can see
through your shirt.

2325
01:21:12,754 --> 01:21:14,022
Oh, God, are you serious?
Oh, my God.

2326
01:21:14,023 --> 01:21:15,824
What are you doing
with the bat?

2327
01:21:15,825 --> 01:21:18,093
Just let 'em try to come over here, Shan.
Just let 'em try.

2328
01:21:18,094 --> 01:21:20,594
They're not going to throw softballs at you...
they're going to shoot you, moron.

2329
01:21:20,595 --> 01:21:23,331
Get your bag. Oh, would you get
over yourself, for Christ sake.

2330
01:21:23,332 --> 01:21:25,300
Bring it on, motherfuckers!

2331
01:21:25,301 --> 01:21:27,001
Not you, Mrs. Amendola.

2332
01:21:27,903 --> 01:21:28,970
Hi. Can I drive? Hi.

2333
01:21:28,971 --> 01:21:30,605
No, but if you could
make your way around...

2334
01:21:30,606 --> 01:21:32,275
Why don't you get
out and I'll drive.

2335
01:21:32,276 --> 01:21:33,743
But if you could make your...
I'm a really good driver.

2336
01:21:33,744 --> 01:21:34,543
Mullins!

2337
01:21:34,544 --> 01:21:35,677
Your Mom, your Mom.

2338
01:21:35,678 --> 01:21:37,412
Our lives are in danger.
Ma! Ma!

2339
01:21:37,413 --> 01:21:38,680
I may have to change my name.
Hey, come on.

2340
01:21:38,681 --> 01:21:40,615
What are you doing?
So if you get a call

2341
01:21:40,616 --> 01:21:42,718
from someone named Carla, it's me.
Stop! God Almighty!

2342
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:45,321
When did you become such
a fucking princess?

2343
01:21:45,322 --> 01:21:46,689
You make it impossible.
You hear this?

2344
01:21:46,690 --> 01:21:47,757
All right, seat
belts, everyone.

2345
01:21:47,758 --> 01:21:49,324
Come on, buddy.
Come on, buddy.

2346
01:21:49,325 --> 01:21:50,525
Right in here, buddy. No, no.
Highly allergic.

2347
01:21:50,526 --> 01:21:52,261
What the fuck is this?!
Highly allergic.

2348
01:21:52,262 --> 01:21:53,696
That's my puppy. I got him four months ago.
Highly allergic.

2349
01:21:53,697 --> 01:21:55,565
I named him Kevin Garnett.
No. No.

2350
01:21:55,566 --> 01:21:57,066
You're an asshole. You got to
see the cock on this thing.

2351
01:21:57,067 --> 01:21:58,067
We're going to a motel.

2352
01:21:58,068 --> 01:21:59,635
We're not bring... Move.

2353
01:21:59,636 --> 01:22:02,239
We're not bringing this
fucking horse to a motel.

2354
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:03,974
We got to get Gina. For what?

2355
01:22:03,975 --> 01:22:06,309
Because you put her
fucking life in danger!

2356
01:22:06,310 --> 01:22:07,477
Nobody gives a shit about her.

2357
01:22:07,478 --> 01:22:09,178
If I'm going, Gina's going.

2358
01:22:09,179 --> 01:22:10,781
Get in there. I'm not
going unless we get Gina.

2359
01:22:10,782 --> 01:22:12,182
Just get in. We're
getting Gina.

2360
01:22:12,183 --> 01:22:13,517
Move your feet!
I'll chop them off.

2361
01:22:13,518 --> 01:22:14,585
Thank you. Shut up!

2362
01:22:14,586 --> 01:22:15,853
We're going to Gina's!

2363
01:22:15,854 --> 01:22:17,721
Everyone put your seat belt on.

2364
01:22:17,722 --> 01:22:19,755
<i>God, I hope a truck
hits us and we all die.</i>

2365
01:22:21,859 --> 01:22:23,293
Oh, God.

2366
01:22:23,294 --> 01:22:24,927
What the fuck is
this girl doing?

2367
01:22:27,998 --> 01:22:29,033
Could she go any slower?

2368
01:22:29,034 --> 01:22:30,335
Could she physically
go slower?

2369
01:22:30,336 --> 01:22:31,569
Go get your girlfriend,

2370
01:22:31,570 --> 01:22:32,570
for God's sake.
Um, okay, please.

2371
01:22:32,571 --> 01:22:33,905
She's fine, Ma!

2372
01:22:33,906 --> 01:22:36,140
I forgot my curling
iron, Mrs. Mullins!

2373
01:22:36,141 --> 01:22:37,341
Come on, Gina!

2374
01:22:37,342 --> 01:22:38,376
Get in the car!

2375
01:22:38,377 --> 01:22:39,677
What the fuck?

2376
01:22:39,678 --> 01:22:41,279
I got you the rollie so
you could roll the bag,

2377
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:42,480
so get over here!

2378
01:22:42,481 --> 01:22:44,015
You kidding? You
bought me a bag

2379
01:22:44,016 --> 01:22:46,484
for Christmas so that I
could carry my own luggage?

2380
01:22:46,485 --> 01:22:48,154
Gina, come on. Let's go.

2381
01:22:48,155 --> 01:22:49,854
I'm gonna get you a
dicksucker for Christmas,

2382
01:22:49,855 --> 01:22:51,222
so I don't have
to do it no more.

2383
01:22:51,223 --> 01:22:52,223
Go get her! I'ml'm going!

2384
01:22:52,224 --> 01:22:53,525
Jesus Christ! Gina!

2385
01:22:53,526 --> 01:22:54,526
You really... you
didn't say that.

2386
01:22:54,527 --> 01:22:55,660
Oh, that got your attention.

2387
01:22:55,661 --> 01:22:56,962
Go on, go get her.
Come on, Pete,

2388
01:22:56,963 --> 01:22:58,697
just break up with this
girl, for fuck sakes.

2389
01:22:58,698 --> 01:23:00,099
This'll help. Come on,
you're making a scene!

2390
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:01,233
Let's go, let's go!

2391
01:23:01,234 --> 01:23:02,635
Let's go, you assholes. Okay?

2392
01:23:02,636 --> 01:23:03,836
Let's go, Mark! You think
you're man enough?

2393
01:23:03,837 --> 01:23:05,203
Come on! You fucking
man enough?

2394
01:23:05,204 --> 01:23:06,438
Knock it off!

2395
01:23:06,439 --> 01:23:08,340
Just knock it off!

2396
01:23:08,341 --> 01:23:09,775
I got this, I got this!
Come on.

2397
01:23:09,776 --> 01:23:11,944
Hey, assholes! Get in the car.

2398
01:23:11,945 --> 01:23:13,379
You animals! Whoa!

2399
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:14,680
Get in the car!
Get in the car!

2400
01:23:14,681 --> 01:23:16,183
Did she just pull out a gun?

2401
01:23:16,184 --> 01:23:17,551
You know what happens now?!

2402
01:23:17,552 --> 01:23:19,485
You don't get this one! No.

2403
01:23:19,486 --> 01:23:22,488
So, uh, Jason, your
family seemsseems nice.

2404
01:23:22,489 --> 01:23:25,292
Yeah, we, uh, we
have our good days.

2405
01:23:25,293 --> 01:23:27,160
But my makeup is in that one!

2406
01:23:27,161 --> 01:23:28,727
I'll rip your
fucking pants off!

2407
01:23:38,838 --> 01:23:40,640
<i>If we just knew where
that shipment was</i>

2408
01:23:40,641 --> 01:23:42,008
coming into, we would have,

2409
01:23:42,009 --> 01:23:43,744
we would have Larkin and
we would have Julian,

2410
01:23:43,745 --> 01:23:45,413
they would both be there,
and we could get them.

2411
01:23:45,414 --> 01:23:48,716
I'm just happy that Jason, you
know, is out of there for now.

2412
01:23:48,717 --> 01:23:50,083
Yeah.

2413
01:23:50,084 --> 01:23:51,618
It's a shame, though.

2414
01:23:51,619 --> 01:23:52,887
Having your brother
on the inside

2415
01:23:52,888 --> 01:23:54,288
would be a, would
be a coup for us.

2416
01:23:54,289 --> 01:23:55,690
That's what you want to say?

2417
01:23:55,691 --> 01:23:56,724
'Cause you're saying
that out loud.

2418
01:23:56,725 --> 01:23:58,459
Okay, you know what, Mullins?

2419
01:23:58,460 --> 01:24:00,394
You would say exactly the same
thing if it wasn't your brother.

2420
01:24:00,395 --> 01:24:01,696
We're done talking about this.

2421
01:24:01,697 --> 01:24:02,831
So, if it was just some
random drug dealer,

2422
01:24:02,832 --> 01:24:04,099
you wouldn't send him back in?

2423
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:05,366
If it was someone like,

2424
01:24:05,367 --> 01:24:07,034
I don't know, Rojas,
you wouldn't...

2425
01:24:07,035 --> 01:24:08,869
We're not talking about
Rojas, are we? Okay.

2426
01:24:08,870 --> 01:24:10,605
We're talking about Jason,
my brother, you fuckwit.

2427
01:24:10,606 --> 01:24:12,007
Okay, you know what?
We all have

2428
01:24:12,008 --> 01:24:13,709
a lot to lose if we
don't catch Larkin.

2429
01:24:13,710 --> 01:24:14,776
Yeah, what do you have to lose?

2430
01:24:14,777 --> 01:24:16,111
I have a lot. Yeah?

2431
01:24:16,112 --> 01:24:17,512
Some bullshit promotion?

2432
01:24:17,513 --> 01:24:19,581
You don't give a
shit about my family

2433
01:24:19,582 --> 01:24:21,617
or if Jason gets out
there and gets killed.

2434
01:24:21,618 --> 01:24:22,918
I feel that you're
not being honest.

2435
01:24:22,919 --> 01:24:24,453
Because nobody, nobody
forced your brother

2436
01:24:24,454 --> 01:24:25,587
to get involved with drugs.

2437
01:24:25,588 --> 01:24:27,055
You're an asshole for that.

2438
01:24:27,056 --> 01:24:29,057
Okay, you know what?
That's not helping either.

2439
01:24:29,058 --> 01:24:30,827
See, I'm trying to
create a dialogue.

2440
01:24:30,828 --> 01:24:33,529
Note that I am starting my
statements with "I feel."

2441
01:24:33,530 --> 01:24:35,264
I feel... Oh, I feel
like you're an asshole.

2442
01:24:35,265 --> 01:24:36,465
You know what I feel?

2443
01:24:36,466 --> 01:24:38,100
I feel that you have
worn that shirt

2444
01:24:38,101 --> 01:24:40,637
every single day this week, and
I feel that you turning it

2445
01:24:40,638 --> 01:24:42,472
inside out does not
make it a new shirt.

2446
01:24:42,473 --> 01:24:43,873
Well, I feel like it does.

2447
01:24:43,874 --> 01:24:46,309
Oh, really? Okay, well,
I feel I disagree.

2448
01:24:46,310 --> 01:24:47,443
Must be nice.

2449
01:24:47,444 --> 01:24:48,811
What? What? Must
be really nice

2450
01:24:48,812 --> 01:24:50,179
for you to just know everything.

2451
01:24:50,180 --> 01:24:51,881
To be so much smarter
than everybody else.

2452
01:24:51,882 --> 01:24:53,549
I... I don't profess
to know everything,

2453
01:24:53,550 --> 01:24:55,184
but I do know quite a bit.

2454
01:24:55,185 --> 01:24:57,453
And what I know is accurate
and scientifically proven,

2455
01:24:57,454 --> 01:24:58,756
and I just share that
information with you.

2456
01:24:58,757 --> 01:24:59,957
If you have a problem with that,

2457
01:24:59,958 --> 01:25:01,291
tune me out like
you always do.

2458
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:04,228
Help! He's choking!

2459
01:25:04,229 --> 01:25:05,862
Okay, I've got it, I've got it.
He's choking, help!

2460
01:25:05,863 --> 01:25:07,297
Sir. Somebody call
an ambulance!

2461
01:25:07,298 --> 01:25:08,931
Okay, I got it. I got it.
Call...

2462
01:25:09,968 --> 01:25:11,402
Check his mouth,
check his mouth!

2463
01:25:11,403 --> 01:25:12,603
Nothing in there!
Okay, all right.

2464
01:25:12,604 --> 01:25:14,772
Let's lay him down.
Sir, just relax.

2465
01:25:14,773 --> 01:25:16,173
Everything will be just fine.
Let me get his head back.

2466
01:25:16,174 --> 01:25:17,509
Okay? Yeah, okay.

2467
01:25:17,510 --> 01:25:18,843
He's choking. You're
gonna be okay.

2468
01:25:18,844 --> 01:25:19,943
I need a, I need a knife
and a straw please!

2469
01:25:19,944 --> 01:25:21,078
I need a knife and
a straw please!

2470
01:25:21,079 --> 01:25:22,646
Why do you need a
knife and a straw?

2471
01:25:22,647 --> 01:25:23,714
Why? I need them
'cause I'm gonna

2472
01:25:23,715 --> 01:25:25,149
perform an emergency
tracheotomy.

2473
01:25:25,150 --> 01:25:26,350
What?! I'm gonna need
a glass of vodka.

2474
01:25:26,351 --> 01:25:27,786
Vodka! It's a Denny's!

2475
01:25:27,787 --> 01:25:29,354
Uh, for sterilization...
hot water.

2476
01:25:29,355 --> 01:25:31,022
Do you know what you're doing?
Have you done this before?

2477
01:25:31,023 --> 01:25:32,490
Technically, technically,
no, but I've been,

2478
01:25:32,491 --> 01:25:33,925
I've been doing some
research, and I feel

2479
01:25:33,926 --> 01:25:35,793
fairly confident I know how.
Fairly confident?

2480
01:25:35,794 --> 01:25:37,429
Jesus! He's still choking, you know.
It isn't time to stop.

2481
01:25:37,430 --> 01:25:39,230
Okay, sir, what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna find your...

2482
01:25:39,231 --> 01:25:40,865
Oh, God, don't, please don't
put that in there. Shh.

2483
01:25:40,866 --> 01:25:42,033
Stop touching me... so, the
cricothyroid membrane...

2484
01:25:42,034 --> 01:25:44,002
I think, I think
it's right here.

2485
01:25:44,003 --> 01:25:45,738
I'm gonna make a small incision.
Please don't do that.

2486
01:25:45,739 --> 01:25:47,473
Let go of my hand, let go of
my hand, let go of my hand.

2487
01:25:47,474 --> 01:25:48,774
I'm gonna make a
small incision.

2488
01:25:48,775 --> 01:25:49,974
The reason I'm doing this...
Oh!

2489
01:25:49,975 --> 01:25:51,009
Oh, God.

2490
01:25:51,010 --> 01:25:52,677
Is because you're choking.

2491
01:25:52,678 --> 01:25:53,878
I'm gonna cut in...

2492
01:25:53,879 --> 01:25:55,314
Wow, okay, just a
little bigger.

2493
01:25:55,315 --> 01:25:57,583
Wow, okay, that goes in
deeper than I thought.

2494
01:25:57,584 --> 01:25:59,018
I'm gonna insert my fingers in here
because what's happening is...

2495
01:25:59,019 --> 01:26:01,153
Don't put your
finger in there.

2496
01:26:01,154 --> 01:26:03,022
Don't put your finger in there.
Wow, that feels a lot different.

2497
01:26:03,023 --> 01:26:04,324
There's the membrane, okay?

2498
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:05,391
It's a fucking horror show!

2499
01:26:05,392 --> 01:26:07,026
Don't put your
fingers in there!

2500
01:26:07,027 --> 01:26:08,928
Sir, what I'm gonna do
is I'm going to insert

2501
01:26:08,929 --> 01:26:10,429
the straw in the hole.

2502
01:26:10,430 --> 01:26:12,965
And it's gonna allow the
oxygen to get to your brain.

2503
01:26:12,966 --> 01:26:14,668
Now if you give it one moment,

2504
01:26:14,669 --> 01:26:16,002
you're gonna feel the oxygen
flow into your brain.

2505
01:26:16,003 --> 01:26:17,971
There we go.
That's not oxygen!

2506
01:26:17,972 --> 01:26:20,039
Jesus Christ, that's not oxygen!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

2507
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:21,607
That's a lot of blood.
What are you doing to him?

2508
01:26:21,608 --> 01:26:22,909
Oh, my God, ah! Oh, Jesus!

2509
01:26:22,910 --> 01:26:24,411
Oh, my God, there's
so much blood!

2510
01:26:24,412 --> 01:26:25,612
I don't know what I'm doing!

2511
01:26:25,613 --> 01:26:27,180
Stop crying! You did this!

2512
01:26:27,181 --> 01:26:28,949
Is the ambulance coming?!
You're fucking killing him!

2513
01:26:28,950 --> 01:26:30,450
I'm so sorry! I got it, I
got it, I got it, move!

2514
01:26:30,451 --> 01:26:31,731
I'm so sorry! What
are you doing?

2515
01:26:33,455 --> 01:26:34,555
So much blood!

2516
01:26:34,556 --> 01:26:35,989
You asshole! Oh, my God!

2517
01:26:35,990 --> 01:26:37,290
You probably could have just

2518
01:26:37,291 --> 01:26:39,025
pulled the piece of pancake
out of his throat.

2519
01:26:39,026 --> 01:26:40,427
He's alive, isn't he?

2520
01:26:40,428 --> 01:26:42,830
You know what? I have a cut
on my arm from earlier.

2521
01:26:42,831 --> 01:26:44,265
Do you think I
should amputate it?

2522
01:26:44,266 --> 01:26:45,566
You know you're not a
real doctor, right?

2523
01:26:45,567 --> 01:26:46,567
Yeah, neither are you.

2524
01:26:46,568 --> 01:26:47,902
Okay.

2525
01:26:47,903 --> 01:26:49,337
Yeah, byebye. You're
a reckless person.

2526
01:26:49,338 --> 01:26:51,072
See you later. Yeah, thank you.
Okay, thank you.

2527
01:26:51,073 --> 01:26:52,072
Byebye. Not you.

2528
01:26:55,610 --> 01:26:57,611
Oh, my God.

2529
01:27:03,252 --> 01:27:04,819
Ashburn.

2530
01:27:06,687 --> 01:27:08,823
Why don't you have
your own phone?

2531
01:27:08,824 --> 01:27:10,492
Who am I, the Queen of England?

2532
01:27:10,493 --> 01:27:13,362
I don't know, does the Queen of
England only wear sweatpants?

2533
01:27:13,363 --> 01:27:14,963
Fuck you. You... "F" you.

2534
01:27:14,964 --> 01:27:17,166
This is Mullins. Hey,
Shan, I left, all right?

2535
01:27:17,167 --> 01:27:18,434
I couldn't sit there anymore.
What are you talking about?

2536
01:27:18,435 --> 01:27:19,436
Where the hell are you?

2537
01:27:19,437 --> 01:27:20,736
Look, I talked to them,

2538
01:27:20,737 --> 01:27:21,870
and everything's
fine, all right?

2539
01:27:21,871 --> 01:27:22,871
Nothing's weird, we're good.

2540
01:27:22,872 --> 01:27:23,972
Nonono, nonono!

2541
01:27:23,973 --> 01:27:25,507
It doesn't work that way, Jason.

2542
01:27:25,508 --> 01:27:27,109
They know you're my brother.
Yeah, but they also know

2543
01:27:27,110 --> 01:27:28,678
you arrested me,
and I made it seem

2544
01:27:28,679 --> 01:27:30,246
like I hated you.
That's good, right?

2545
01:27:30,247 --> 01:27:31,514
Itit doesn't work that way.
What's happening?

2546
01:27:31,515 --> 01:27:33,082
Shut up for a minute.

2547
01:27:33,083 --> 01:27:34,784
Look, I know where the
shipment's going to, all right?

2548
01:27:34,785 --> 01:27:36,285
Okay, I don't give a
shit about the shipment!

2549
01:27:36,286 --> 01:27:37,854
What shipment? Just get
your ass back here now.

2550
01:27:37,855 --> 01:27:39,522
Let me talk... Look,
I'm gonna stick around

2551
01:27:39,523 --> 01:27:41,090
and work it or they're gonna
know something's weird.

2552
01:27:41,091 --> 01:27:42,992
Get off me. No, it's my phone.

2553
01:27:42,993 --> 01:27:44,961
Please trust me... I... I'm trying
to do the right thing here.

2554
01:27:44,962 --> 01:27:46,596
Are you, are you kidding me?
What?

2555
01:27:46,597 --> 01:27:47,832
Jason, Jason. Ow.

2556
01:27:47,833 --> 01:27:49,433
Jesus Christ. Jason! Ow!
Let go of my vest.

2557
01:27:49,434 --> 01:27:50,900
Shan. Ow. Jason, it's Ashburn.

2558
01:27:50,901 --> 01:27:52,035
What the fuck is going on?

2559
01:27:52,036 --> 01:27:53,736
Give it to me.
What have you got?

2560
01:27:53,737 --> 01:27:55,038
Don't talk to her! Look,
the shipment's coming

2561
01:27:55,039 --> 01:27:57,274
into the Boston Harbor
Shipyard at 11:00.

2562
01:27:57,275 --> 01:27:59,043
Okay. It's a big freighter,
tons of guys, all right?

2563
01:27:59,044 --> 01:28:00,878
No, I got it, I got... They're
gonna be heavily armed,

2564
01:28:00,879 --> 01:28:02,112
so you got to be
careful, you hear me?

2565
01:28:02,113 --> 01:28:03,113
Okay, okay. God, get off!

2566
01:28:03,114 --> 01:28:04,682
The ship is called the, uh,

2567
01:28:04,683 --> 01:28:06,217
"S.S. Tank" or something
like that, all right?

2568
01:28:06,218 --> 01:28:07,751
I promise we'll be there.

2569
01:28:07,752 --> 01:28:09,053
All right, II got to go.
Thank you.

2570
01:28:09,054 --> 01:28:10,521
I'll break your fucking arm!

2571
01:28:10,522 --> 01:28:12,323
God! Okay, take it easy.

2572
01:28:12,324 --> 01:28:14,391
Just take, just take it
easy, just take it easy.

2573
01:28:14,392 --> 01:28:15,627
Just...

2574
01:28:15,628 --> 01:28:18,396
Jason? Jason?

2575
01:28:18,397 --> 01:28:19,964
Shit!

2576
01:28:21,799 --> 01:28:23,200
You just made my
brother a dead man!

2577
01:28:23,201 --> 01:28:24,703
No, no, he's gonna be fine.

2578
01:28:24,704 --> 01:28:26,238
Mullins, I swear,
he'll be fine.

2579
01:28:26,239 --> 01:28:28,106
We'll... we're gonna
have thethe full power

2580
01:28:28,107 --> 01:28:29,708
of the, uh, the Boston FBI

2581
01:28:29,709 --> 01:28:32,477
down on that terminal
tonight, I promise you.

2582
01:28:32,478 --> 01:28:33,946
He's gonna be fine.

2583
01:28:33,947 --> 01:28:35,680
It really is a good thing.

2584
01:28:35,681 --> 01:28:37,281
You'llyou'll thank me.
Shut up!

2585
01:28:45,658 --> 01:28:47,627
All right. Ship's coming in.

2586
01:28:47,628 --> 01:28:48,828
Time to lock and load.

2587
01:28:48,829 --> 01:28:50,329
Okay, here we go.

2588
01:28:50,330 --> 01:28:52,630
Here we go.

2589
01:28:59,406 --> 01:29:00,940
Police. Put your hands up.

2590
01:29:00,941 --> 01:29:02,175
FBI!

2591
01:29:02,176 --> 01:29:03,510
Get your fucking hands in the air!
Now!

2592
01:29:03,511 --> 01:29:06,345
Let's see them!

2593
01:29:06,346 --> 01:29:07,914
Boat's clean.

2594
01:29:07,915 --> 01:29:09,849
It'sit's not clean.

2595
01:29:09,850 --> 01:29:12,352
We found a joint in that
girl's purse. If...

2596
01:29:12,353 --> 01:29:15,322
Oh, now, this is
really a mess.

2597
01:29:15,323 --> 01:29:18,225
Sir, we just, we just have
to hit the streets again.

2598
01:29:18,226 --> 01:29:20,459
We hit the streets, a and
if the shipment came in...

2599
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:22,029
Ashburn, enough.

2600
01:29:22,030 --> 01:29:23,797
It's over. I'm sending
you back to New York.

2601
01:29:23,798 --> 01:29:25,232
Sir, sir, nononono,
please, please.

2602
01:29:25,233 --> 01:29:26,967
I'ml'm telling
you, I'm so close.

2603
01:29:26,968 --> 01:29:28,969
I'm so close, and this was
just a little hiccup.

2604
01:29:28,970 --> 01:29:30,438
No, it wasn't a hiccup.

2605
01:29:30,439 --> 01:29:32,440
<i>Lo siento.</i>

2606
01:29:32,441 --> 01:29:33,575
Don't...

2607
01:29:33,576 --> 01:29:35,142
Don't even... Oh, God.

2608
01:29:38,478 --> 01:29:39,847
Uh, um, sorry.

2609
01:29:39,848 --> 01:29:41,316
Uh, Detective Mullins...
have you seen her?

2610
01:29:41,317 --> 01:29:42,717
Oh, hospital.

2611
01:29:42,718 --> 01:29:45,219
Some kind of family emergency.

2612
01:29:45,220 --> 01:29:48,021
Oh, God.

2613
01:30:04,473 --> 01:30:07,075
He's in an induced coma.

2614
01:30:07,076 --> 01:30:10,145
They shot him and left
him out in the street.

2615
01:30:10,146 --> 01:30:13,749
I'm so sorry, Mullins.

2616
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:15,884
I'm sorry.

2617
01:30:15,885 --> 01:30:17,721
Yeah, he was
trying to move on.

2618
01:30:17,722 --> 01:30:19,022
He had a job interview.

2619
01:30:19,023 --> 01:30:20,756
I... I saw the résumé.

2620
01:30:20,757 --> 01:30:22,291
It was a terrible résumé.

2621
01:30:22,292 --> 01:30:26,428
He... mentioned prison,
and in "special skills,"

2622
01:30:26,429 --> 01:30:29,599
he said, "Keeping
it real," but he...

2623
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:31,768
he was trying.

2624
01:30:31,769 --> 01:30:33,870
How'show's your
family holding up?

2625
01:30:33,871 --> 01:30:35,839
Well, they're not talking to me.

2626
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:37,707
Blame me more now than ever.

2627
01:30:37,708 --> 01:30:38,875
It's not your fault.

2628
01:30:38,876 --> 01:30:40,276
Yes, it is.

2629
01:30:40,277 --> 01:30:43,513
Damn it, I should have
handled it by myself.

2630
01:30:43,514 --> 01:30:45,482
So that's it?

2631
01:30:48,119 --> 01:30:50,621
I'm not your, I'm not
your partner anymore?

2632
01:30:50,622 --> 01:30:52,355
No, you're not.

2633
01:30:52,356 --> 01:30:54,557
You're another fucking
disappointment.

2634
01:30:54,558 --> 01:30:57,061
I just want you to know
that I'm gonna find

2635
01:30:57,062 --> 01:30:59,095
the man responsible for this.

2636
01:31:00,931 --> 01:31:02,499
Hey, Shan.

2637
01:31:05,070 --> 01:31:07,772

Hey.

2653
01:32:05,834 --> 01:32:07,165
I'll give these back to you.

2654
01:32:08,234 --> 01:32:10,571
Thank you so much for your help.

2655
01:32:10,572 --> 01:32:12,272
Anytime.

2656
01:32:12,273 --> 01:32:13,807
Hey...

2657
01:32:13,808 --> 01:32:15,142
We're gonna miss
you around here.

2658
01:32:15,143 --> 01:32:17,578
Oh, I don't think so.

2659
01:32:17,579 --> 01:32:18,846
I might.

2660
01:32:18,847 --> 01:32:20,314
Oh...

2661
01:32:22,883 --> 01:32:25,252
You did a good job out there.

2662
01:32:25,253 --> 01:32:27,821
Just keep your fingers
out of guys' necks.

2663
01:32:27,822 --> 01:32:29,224
It's nasty.

2664
01:32:29,225 --> 01:32:30,517
Bye.

2665
01:32:31,516 --> 01:32:32,610
Bye.

2666
01:32:32,611 --> 01:32:33,828
All right, if anybody
has any questions,

2667
01:32:33,829 --> 01:32:35,063
you come to Adam or myself.

2668
01:32:35,064 --> 01:32:36,263
That's all we got.

2669
01:32:36,264 --> 01:32:38,032
All right.

2670
01:32:38,033 --> 01:32:40,201
We sent out alerts to
airports, train stations.

2671
01:32:40,202 --> 01:32:41,903
DEA's gonna take the lead
on this one, all right?

2672
01:32:41,904 --> 01:32:43,638
Now, although this is

2673
01:32:43,639 --> 01:32:47,409
a joint task force, we're also
working with the Boston PD.

2674
01:32:47,410 --> 01:32:49,345
Right. Adam and I are gonna be
handpicking all the officers

2675
01:32:49,346 --> 01:32:50,746
so we don't wind up with this.

2676
01:32:50,747 --> 01:32:52,813
Ooh, ooh.

2677
01:32:53,982 --> 01:32:55,550
All right, any questions?

2678
01:32:55,551 --> 01:32:56,852
Hey.

2679
01:32:56,853 --> 01:32:58,220
Hey, that's not right.

2680
01:32:58,221 --> 01:33:00,422
No, it's not.

2681
01:33:00,423 --> 01:33:02,224
No, that officer that
you're making fun of,

2682
01:33:02,225 --> 01:33:04,426
the one that you're all laughing
at, has more integrity,

2683
01:33:04,427 --> 01:33:06,195
more commitment, more
courage and more guts

2684
01:33:06,196 --> 01:33:07,897
than anybody in this room.

2685
01:33:07,898 --> 01:33:09,864
Yeah. But less
mental stability.

2686
01:33:11,701 --> 01:33:13,936
Okay, okay, so, um,
justjust to be clear,

2687
01:33:13,937 --> 01:33:15,872
what does mental
instability look like?

2688
01:33:15,873 --> 01:33:17,340
Keeping people safe?

2689
01:33:17,341 --> 01:33:19,042
Protecting the community?
Getting the job done?

2690
01:33:19,043 --> 01:33:21,044
Is that what it looks like?
Well, then great.

2691
01:33:21,045 --> 01:33:22,411
If that's what mental
instability looks like,

2692
01:33:22,412 --> 01:33:23,979
sign me up for the crazy house.

2693
01:33:23,980 --> 01:33:25,916
That officer right there

2694
01:33:25,917 --> 01:33:27,984
is a better law
enforcement officer

2695
01:33:27,985 --> 01:33:30,020
than anybody in this room.

2696
01:33:30,021 --> 01:33:31,188
Myself included.

2697
01:33:31,189 --> 01:33:32,589
She is better than you,

2698
01:33:32,590 --> 01:33:34,192
she is better than you,

2699
01:33:34,193 --> 01:33:36,027
and she's definitely
better than you.

2700
01:33:36,028 --> 01:33:38,028
What are you doing?!
Are you texting?

2701
01:33:38,029 --> 01:33:39,162
Are you playing a game? What?

2702
01:33:39,163 --> 01:33:40,397
What is it? Put it away.

2703
01:33:40,398 --> 01:33:42,299
Put it away. God, you
guys are just...

2704
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:44,101
What is, what is the
matter with you?

2705
01:33:44,102 --> 01:33:46,103
You're such, you're
just such jerks!

2706
01:33:46,104 --> 01:33:48,673
You're just such...

2707
01:33:48,674 --> 01:33:50,208
You're just a shitjerk!

2708
01:33:50,209 --> 01:33:53,711
You're just a
shitjerk dickfucker!

2709
01:33:53,712 --> 01:33:57,448
You're a shitjerk
dickfucker assholer!

2710
01:33:57,449 --> 01:33:59,784
And you all can just
go fuck yourselves!

2711
01:33:59,785 --> 01:34:01,085
Not... sorry, senor, not you.

2712
01:34:01,086 --> 01:34:02,955
Pardon, please.

2713
01:34:02,956 --> 01:34:05,790
Just, all you fuckers!

2714
01:34:14,900 --> 01:34:16,501
Get on the ground!

2715
01:34:16,502 --> 01:34:18,503
You are under arrest! Put your
hands where I can see them,

2716
01:34:18,504 --> 01:34:20,038
and tell me where
the fuck Larkin is!

2717
01:34:20,039 --> 01:34:21,640
Hey.

2718
01:34:21,641 --> 01:34:25,277
I think it'd be much more better
if you put your hands up.

2719
01:34:25,278 --> 01:34:27,646
"Much more better"?

2720
01:34:27,647 --> 01:34:30,350
Drop the gun and take a
grammar course, you idiot.

2721
01:34:30,351 --> 01:34:32,452
Who the fuck are you?

2722
01:34:32,453 --> 01:34:35,021
Me and her?

2723
01:34:35,022 --> 01:34:36,921
We're the fuckin' heat.

2724
01:34:38,558 --> 01:34:41,027
All right.

2725
01:34:41,028 --> 01:34:42,929
We've got some scumbags
to visit, huh?

2726
01:34:42,930 --> 01:34:44,063
Yeah, we do.

2727
01:34:44,064 --> 01:34:45,231
Get up, asshole.

2728
01:34:45,232 --> 01:34:47,133
Let's go.

2729
01:34:47,134 --> 01:34:49,303
<i>♪ Ooh. ♪</i>

2730
01:34:49,304 --> 01:34:50,638
Where's Larkin?

2731
01:34:50,639 --> 01:34:52,105
What? I don't even
know who that is.

2732
01:34:52,106 --> 01:34:53,406
Where is he?! I told you,

2733
01:34:53,407 --> 01:34:54,807
I don't know who
the fuck that is!

2734
01:34:54,808 --> 01:34:56,976
Really? Okay, so it's clean?

2735
01:34:56,977 --> 01:34:59,113
Clean? You not
finding anything?

2736
01:34:59,114 --> 01:35:00,714
Nothing in here?
Really, you...

2737
01:35:00,715 --> 01:35:02,816
Right, okay, hhold on a second.
How about this?

2738
01:35:02,817 --> 01:35:05,379
Right there!

2739
01:35:06,453 --> 01:35:08,055
Got your pizza.

2740
01:35:08,056 --> 01:35:09,123
Got your pizza, mister.

2741
01:35:09,124 --> 01:35:10,390
Just a minute, Lou.

2742
01:35:11,525 --> 01:35:13,160
Fresh hot pizza.
Get on your knees!

2743
01:35:13,161 --> 01:35:14,962
What the fuck is this?
Get down on the ground!

2744
01:35:14,963 --> 01:35:16,563
Where's your stash? I
don't have anything yet.

2745
01:35:16,564 --> 01:35:18,333
I'm waiting to get some
from a new distributor.

2746
01:35:18,334 --> 01:35:19,634
Who's your new distributor?

2747
01:35:19,635 --> 01:35:21,335

Listen, I don't know
what y'all doing here!

2753
01:35:32,648 --> 01:35:33,581
I'm out the game.

2754
01:35:33,582 --> 01:35:34,983
You know what I hate? Drugs.

2755
01:35:34,984 --> 01:35:35,984
I'm a different man.

2756
01:35:38,053 --> 01:35:39,554
This is not mine.

2757
01:35:39,555 --> 01:35:41,256
I just bought that
refrigerator the other day.

2758
01:35:41,257 --> 01:35:42,857
This must have been in there.

2759
01:35:42,858 --> 01:35:46,595
We want to know where all
this new shit is coming from.

2760
01:35:46,596 --> 01:35:47,997
Where is Larkin?

2761
01:35:47,998 --> 01:35:50,700
Bitch, which part of "I'm
out" do you not understand?

2762
01:35:50,701 --> 01:35:52,433
I'm out!

2763
01:35:54,302 --> 01:35:55,571
You want to interview him?

2764
01:35:55,572 --> 01:35:56,772
Mm, no.

2765
01:35:56,773 --> 01:36:00,675
No, I think I have
something better in mind.

2766
01:36:01,912 --> 01:36:03,212
Oh, shit!

2767
01:36:03,213 --> 01:36:04,748
I don't know shit! Come on!

2768
01:36:04,749 --> 01:36:07,049
I don't know, you're getting
awfully heavy, Rojas.

2769
01:36:07,050 --> 01:36:08,617
Yeah, lie to me again.

2770
01:36:08,618 --> 01:36:10,820
I want to feel your body sliding
through my delicate hands.

2771
01:36:10,821 --> 01:36:12,888
I don't know shit!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

2772
01:36:12,889 --> 01:36:15,092
I can't, I can't hold you.
No, I don't want to die!

2773
01:36:15,093 --> 01:36:16,159
I don't want to die!

2774
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:17,527
Okay, okay!

2775
01:36:17,528 --> 01:36:19,296
It's at a warehouse
on Summer Street!

2776
01:36:19,297 --> 01:36:20,297
I'm almost disappointed.

2777
01:36:20,298 --> 01:36:21,398
Get me up!

2778
01:36:21,399 --> 01:36:22,565
All right, let's pull him up.

2779
01:36:22,566 --> 01:36:24,101
No, wait, I'm not
kidding anymore.

2780
01:36:24,102 --> 01:36:25,369
I really... I can't lift him up.
What?!

2781
01:36:25,370 --> 01:36:26,737
No! I can't lift him.

2782
01:36:26,738 --> 01:36:28,505
Shit, I've only done
this one other time,

2783
01:36:28,506 --> 01:36:29,940
and it was a really tiny hooker!

2784
01:36:29,941 --> 01:36:31,441
Lift my ass up!

2785
01:36:31,442 --> 01:36:33,311
You ain't fucking putting
nobody over no rails

2786
01:36:33,312 --> 01:36:34,846
you can't fucking lift them out!

2787
01:36:34,847 --> 01:36:36,247
Okay, okay.

2788
01:36:36,248 --> 01:36:40,484
Uh... just tuck your head
and relax your body.

2789
01:36:40,485 --> 01:36:41,986
Lady, what the fuck?!

2790
01:36:41,987 --> 01:36:42,987
God... Crap. Crap.

2791
01:36:42,988 --> 01:36:44,488
Get me up! Let me out!

2792
01:36:50,295 --> 01:36:51,996
Thankthank you again.

2793
01:36:51,997 --> 01:36:53,998
Thank you.

2794
01:36:53,999 --> 01:36:55,233
That was on me.

2795
01:36:55,234 --> 01:36:56,267
I take that.

2796
01:36:56,268 --> 01:36:58,169
I hope this ain't my car.

2797
01:36:58,170 --> 01:37:00,171
This my car? This my car?

2798
01:37:00,172 --> 01:37:01,874

2843
01:38:33,102 --> 01:38:34,970
from break at the same time?

2844
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:38,940
Unfortunate.

2845
01:38:38,941 --> 01:38:41,576
You guys get less attractive
everytime I see you.

2846
01:38:41,577 --> 01:38:43,311
Put the fucking guns down.
No, thanks.

2847
01:38:43,312 --> 01:38:44,313
Nice entrance, Teen Wolf.

2848
01:38:44,314 --> 01:38:45,815
What?!

2849
01:38:45,816 --> 01:38:47,783
You look like a Ninja Turtle, all right?
Take it easy.

2850
01:38:47,784 --> 01:38:50,453
I've held someone at gunpoint for
72 hours before... let's go.

2851
01:38:50,454 --> 01:38:51,721
Wewe need to do what
he says, all right?

2852
01:38:51,722 --> 01:38:52,721
What?!

2853
01:38:52,722 --> 01:38:54,190
It's the, it's the best thing.

2854
01:38:54,191 --> 01:38:55,758
What are we gonna do, shoot
our way out of this?

2855
01:38:55,759 --> 01:38:56,759
Okay, just put the
gun in the bag.

2856
01:38:56,760 --> 01:38:58,861
No, get your...
hold your gun up.

2857
01:38:58,862 --> 01:39:01,130
Just give them the bag and
give them everything! Come on!

2858
01:39:01,131 --> 01:39:02,666
Goddamn you.

2859
01:39:02,667 --> 01:39:04,668
I thought you had my back.
Put it in the bag

2860
01:39:04,669 --> 01:39:06,236
and slide it over, now.

2861
01:39:06,237 --> 01:39:07,670
It's in the bag!
It's in the bag!

2862
01:39:07,671 --> 01:39:09,838
Slide the bag over. Sorry.

2863
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:13,177
I guess you and her
are engaged now, huh?

2864
01:39:13,178 --> 01:39:14,278
What?!

2865
01:39:14,279 --> 01:39:16,980
Well, 'cause you just gave me

2866
01:39:16,981 --> 01:39:18,415
a ring, motherfucker!

2867
01:39:18,416 --> 01:39:19,849
Oh, shit.

2868
01:39:26,657 --> 01:39:28,058
Shit.

2869
01:39:28,059 --> 01:39:29,359
Oh.

2870
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:31,129
Get up. Get up already. Ow.

2871
01:39:31,130 --> 01:39:32,797
Oh, God.

2872
01:39:32,798 --> 01:39:34,465
No, no, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!
Pull it out.

2873
01:39:34,466 --> 01:39:35,533
Okay, that feels broken.
Pull it out.

2874
01:39:35,534 --> 01:39:36,733
It's out!

2875
01:39:37,936 --> 01:39:38,835
Nice work.

2876
01:39:38,836 --> 01:39:40,238
How many of you are there?

2877
01:39:40,239 --> 01:39:41,705
Really?

2878
01:39:44,609 --> 01:39:46,811
Hey...

2879
01:39:46,812 --> 01:39:48,846
How funny.

2880
01:39:48,847 --> 01:39:51,383
This is like when you
were interrogating me,

2881
01:39:51,384 --> 01:39:53,451
only now you're tied up

2882
01:39:53,452 --> 01:39:55,652
and I got all these knives.

2883
01:39:57,155 --> 01:40:00,492
You know, I don't like, uh...
I don't like to shoot people.

2884
01:40:00,493 --> 01:40:01,694
I like cutting people up.

2885
01:40:01,695 --> 01:40:03,861
It's kind of what I do.

2886
01:40:05,998 --> 01:40:08,167
That's athat's a... I like that one.
It's... That's a good one.

2887
01:40:08,168 --> 01:40:10,369
It's a good choice, It's small.
a small one.

2888
01:40:10,370 --> 01:40:11,971
You like this?

2889
01:40:11,972 --> 01:40:13,072
Not too flashy.

2890
01:40:13,073 --> 01:40:16,174
This is actually a
oystershucking knife.

2891
01:40:17,777 --> 01:40:20,714
Either of you ladies need
your oyster shucked?

2892
01:40:20,715 --> 01:40:22,282
Not at the moment.
Not me. Not me.

2893
01:40:22,283 --> 01:40:23,816
You know, I got to tell you,

2894
01:40:23,817 --> 01:40:28,121
I've done this a... lot of
times to a lot of people,

2895
01:40:28,122 --> 01:40:32,057
but you two... you're gonna
be the most fun. What?

2896
01:40:33,260 --> 01:40:35,061
Larkin's here.

2897
01:40:35,062 --> 01:40:37,197
Larkin. Upstairs.

2898
01:40:41,368 --> 01:40:43,236
The fun'll have to wait.

2899
01:40:43,237 --> 01:40:45,038
The boss is here.

2900
01:40:45,039 --> 01:40:48,142
Can you, uh, please excuse
me a second, ladies?

2901
01:40:48,143 --> 01:40:49,510
Sure. Take...

2902
01:40:49,511 --> 01:40:51,412
Yeah, take your time.
whatever time you need.

2903
01:40:51,413 --> 01:40:53,246
Okay, cool. Cool.

2904
01:40:53,247 --> 01:40:55,082
Oh, also, um...

2905
01:40:55,083 --> 01:40:57,551
would you mind
holding this for me?

2906
01:40:57,552 --> 01:41:00,054
Well, mymy hands are
tied, but I can...

2907
01:41:00,055 --> 01:41:03,024
Oh, okay. Let me help you.
Ooh! Jesus!

2908
01:41:03,025 --> 01:41:04,026
Thanks.

2909
01:41:04,027 --> 01:41:07,528
Fuck! Fuck! FF... Shh.

2910
01:41:07,529 --> 01:41:09,163
Fuck, fuck, fuck! Shh...!

2911
01:41:09,164 --> 01:41:11,032
Breathe through the pain.
Breathe through the pain.

2912
01:41:11,033 --> 01:41:13,368
Yeah, do that.

2913
01:41:13,369 --> 01:41:14,836
Do that, do that.

2914
01:41:14,837 --> 01:41:16,004
Breathe it out, breathe
it out, Oh, my God.

2915
01:41:16,005 --> 01:41:17,372
Breathe it out. Okay, Mullins.

2916
01:41:17,373 --> 01:41:18,807
Oh.

2917
01:41:18,808 --> 01:41:20,208
If we should perish in here...

2918
01:41:20,209 --> 01:41:22,344
We're not gonna. All
right, just shh...!

2919
01:41:22,345 --> 01:41:25,447
I know I'm not very good with
my feelings... oh, God...

2920
01:41:25,448 --> 01:41:27,282
but I need to tell
you something, okay?

2921
01:41:27,283 --> 01:41:29,484
Okay, you are...
you are smart,

2922
01:41:29,485 --> 01:41:31,720
you are smart and
you are intuitive,

2923
01:41:31,721 --> 01:41:34,457
and you're the best cop
I'vel've ever worked with.

2924
01:41:34,458 --> 01:41:35,491
Oh, God.

2925
01:41:35,492 --> 01:41:37,093
You, too. Thank you.

2926
01:41:37,094 --> 01:41:39,361
You were right... I went back
and looked at the evidence,

2927
01:41:39,362 --> 01:41:42,131
and I think the Red Falls
Killer is innocent. Oh...

2928
01:41:42,132 --> 01:41:43,700
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

2929
01:41:43,701 --> 01:41:45,268
Did you happen to
mention that to anybody

2930
01:41:45,269 --> 01:41:47,437
before you put yourself in a
lifethreatening situation?

2931
01:41:47,438 --> 01:41:48,504
No, no, I didn't!
No, I didn't!

2932
01:41:48,505 --> 01:41:49,972
Jesus! Good luck.

2933
01:41:49,973 --> 01:41:52,076
You're taking that to
your grave, probably.

2934
01:41:52,077 --> 01:41:53,776
Fuck, the other leg!
Fuck, the other leg!

2935
01:41:53,777 --> 01:41:56,279
Oh, God. I got it. I got it.

2936
01:41:56,280 --> 01:41:58,314
You can move your chair,
too, you know? Just...

2937
01:41:58,315 --> 01:42:00,116
I am moving my chair!

2938
01:42:00,117 --> 01:42:02,319
Just grab the knife.
Grab the knife.

2939
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:03,454
Take it. Take it.

2940
01:42:03,455 --> 01:42:04,921
Take it, just take it.

2941
01:42:06,191 --> 01:42:07,458
I'm sorry.

2942
01:42:07,459 --> 01:42:08,891
I got it!

2943
01:42:08,892 --> 01:42:09,793
Waah!

2944
01:42:09,794 --> 01:42:11,628
Shh. Shut up. Waah! Waah!

2945
01:42:11,629 --> 01:42:13,564
Shut up. Just come on,
come on, all right?

2946
01:42:13,565 --> 01:42:15,432
I am doing it as
fast as I can.

2947
01:42:15,433 --> 01:42:16,633
It's almost there, it's almost
there, it's almost there.

2948
01:42:16,634 --> 01:42:18,435
Whew... Come on. Got it!

2949
01:42:18,436 --> 01:42:22,374
Hurry up, hurry up...
hurry up, hurry up.

2950
01:42:22,375 --> 01:42:24,475
What? Somebody's coming up.

2951
01:42:24,476 --> 01:42:26,176
Got to put it back in. What?!

2952
01:42:26,177 --> 01:42:27,544
I got to put it back in,

2953
01:42:27,545 --> 01:42:28,913
and I'll put my hands
behind my back,

2954
01:42:28,914 --> 01:42:30,882
and then when he gets
close to me, I grab him.

2955
01:42:30,883 --> 01:42:32,784
But you got to shut up and
let me put it back in.

2956
01:42:32,785 --> 01:42:34,052
Okay, just put it
in, put it in...

2957
01:42:34,053 --> 01:42:35,754
Oh, my God, what are you...?
Jesus!

2958
01:42:35,755 --> 01:42:37,188
Sorry, it doesn't go
in that fuckin' easy.

2959
01:42:37,189 --> 01:42:38,723
Just... just... Just
shut up, shut up.

2960
01:42:38,724 --> 01:42:40,558
Ow! Motherfucker.

2961
01:42:40,559 --> 01:42:41,726
Oh... I'm sorry.

2962
01:42:41,727 --> 01:42:43,294
Oh, shit.

2963
01:42:43,295 --> 01:42:45,964
I'll pretend... I'll pretend
to keep my hands tied.

2964
01:42:45,965 --> 01:42:48,133
Shut up! Shut up!

2965
01:42:49,469 --> 01:42:50,770
Oh, no, Scoob!

2966
01:42:50,771 --> 01:42:53,037
Velma and Daphne got captured!

2967
01:42:53,038 --> 01:42:55,774
Ah, I never thought I'd
be happy to see you guys.

2968
01:42:55,775 --> 01:42:57,376
Come on, we got to get
her to the hospital.

2969
01:42:57,377 --> 01:42:58,744
Did you guys call this in?

2970
01:42:58,745 --> 01:43:00,546
Yeah, I sent a fuckin'
owl with a note.

2971
01:43:00,547 --> 01:43:01,981
How did you even
know we were here?

2972
01:43:01,982 --> 01:43:03,416
We followed you. I
knew you weren't

2973
01:43:03,417 --> 01:43:05,151
gonna give up that easily,
especially not after

2974
01:43:05,152 --> 01:43:06,486
they greased your
shitbag brother.

2975
01:43:06,487 --> 01:43:07,853
Fuck you. You know, it takes

2976
01:43:07,854 --> 01:43:09,655
a lot more than Larkin
to take down a Mullins.

2977
01:43:09,656 --> 01:43:11,924
Wait, JaJason's not dead?

2978
01:43:11,925 --> 01:43:13,659
Come on, Adam. Larkin
is on his way.

2979
01:43:13,660 --> 01:43:14,860
What is this, a Q and A?

2980
01:43:14,861 --> 01:43:16,163
Can we fuckin' do this later?

2981
01:43:16,164 --> 01:43:17,631
Yeah, wait... did he
talk to the police?

2982
01:43:17,632 --> 01:43:19,132
Did he see Larkin?
Well, how was she

2983
01:43:19,133 --> 01:43:20,967
supposed to know? He's been in a coma.
Can you please

2984
01:43:20,968 --> 01:43:22,169
continue untying my leg?
That's too bad.

2985
01:43:22,170 --> 01:43:23,803
Where is he? Is he
at Boston General?

2986
01:43:23,804 --> 01:43:25,305
Why, are you gonna send
him fuckin' flowers?

2987
01:43:25,306 --> 01:43:26,740
Why are you so...

2988
01:43:26,741 --> 01:43:28,875
Oh, my God.

2989
01:43:28,876 --> 01:43:30,143
You piece of shit.

2990
01:43:30,144 --> 01:43:32,746
You guys are working
with Larkin.

2991
01:43:32,747 --> 01:43:34,415
I really wish you
hadn't said that.

2992
01:43:34,416 --> 01:43:35,849
Said what?

2993
01:43:36,717 --> 01:43:38,752
Oh, God! Oh, God. Shit!

2994
01:43:38,753 --> 01:43:40,086
God, that felt good.

2995
01:43:40,087 --> 01:43:41,822
God, it wasn't the albino.

2996
01:43:41,823 --> 01:43:43,089
I feel bad.

2997
01:43:43,090 --> 01:43:44,759
Yeah, no, he wasn't
working for Larkin.

2998
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:46,194
He just wanted
you off the case

2999
01:43:46,195 --> 01:43:48,095
'cause he's a
misogynistic asshole.

3000
01:43:48,096 --> 01:43:49,897
Why are you doing this?
You getting some kind of,

3001
01:43:49,898 --> 01:43:51,432
what, a payoff, is
that what it is?

3002
01:43:51,433 --> 01:43:52,801
I was, in the beginning.

3003
01:43:52,802 --> 01:43:54,569
Six years dealing
with these lowlives,

3004
01:43:54,570 --> 01:43:55,703
making shit money.

3005
01:43:55,704 --> 01:43:57,905
Ah.

3006
01:43:57,906 --> 01:43:59,574
You're Larkin.

3007
01:43:59,575 --> 01:44:00,842
Holy shit.

3008
01:44:00,843 --> 01:44:02,277
<i>♪ Tada! ♪</i>

3009
01:44:02,278 --> 01:44:03,545
Get it? Right?

3010
01:44:03,546 --> 01:44:04,913
Makes perfect sense.

3011
01:44:04,914 --> 01:44:06,315
Uh, well, now I'm bragging,

3012
01:44:06,316 --> 01:44:08,783
but it's very nice
having a second income.

3013
01:44:08,784 --> 01:44:11,687
I heard shots. What the...?

3014
01:44:11,688 --> 01:44:12,721
Aw, the albino?

3015
01:44:12,722 --> 01:44:14,256
That guy was hilarious.

3016
01:44:14,257 --> 01:44:15,991
Boss, I don't think that
was such a good idea.

3017
01:44:15,992 --> 01:44:17,926
Yeah, well, you spend three
years in a van with him

3018
01:44:17,927 --> 01:44:19,328
and you'd kill him, too.

3019
01:44:19,329 --> 01:44:20,964
We'll pin it on LeSoire.

3020
01:44:20,965 --> 01:44:23,665
I've got to go to the
hospital to finish Jason.

3021
01:44:23,666 --> 01:44:25,400
You deal with these two.

3022
01:44:25,401 --> 01:44:27,236
No loose ends. Mmhmm.

3023
01:44:27,237 --> 01:44:28,837
Fuckin' rat.

3024
01:44:28,838 --> 01:44:31,641
We told you to stay
out of the way.

3025
01:44:31,642 --> 01:44:33,977
Goodbye.

3026
01:44:33,978 --> 01:44:35,245
You fuckin' rat!

3027
01:44:35,246 --> 01:44:37,580
See you, buddy. Don't
call me buddy.

3028
01:44:37,581 --> 01:44:39,514
He's actually a great guy.

3029
01:44:40,583 --> 01:44:42,318
All right, uh...

3030
01:44:42,319 --> 01:44:44,253
let's have some fun.

3031
01:44:48,791 --> 01:44:51,829
I've been waiting to
do this a long time.

3032
01:44:51,830 --> 01:44:53,796
Campbell's soup...

3033
01:44:53,797 --> 01:44:55,365
you're up first.

3034
01:44:55,366 --> 01:44:57,333
Please don't hurt us.
Please don't hurt us.

3035
01:44:57,334 --> 01:44:59,670
I didn't mean to say
that shit I said.

3036
01:44:59,671 --> 01:45:01,338
Please don't hurt us.

3037
01:45:01,339 --> 01:45:03,107
Aah! God!

3038
01:45:03,108 --> 01:45:04,508
Come on!

3039
01:45:04,509 --> 01:45:06,576
Son of a bitch!

3040
01:45:09,114 --> 01:45:12,248
Mullins, gun at 2:30! Mullins!

3041
01:45:13,685 --> 01:45:15,084
Get...

3042
01:45:16,153 --> 01:45:17,923
Get off! Don't!

3043
01:45:17,924 --> 01:45:20,591
You take one step, and
your partner gets it.

3044
01:45:23,662 --> 01:45:25,396
Oh. Ah.

3045
01:45:25,397 --> 01:45:26,765
Shit!

3046
01:45:26,766 --> 01:45:27,832
Nice.

3047
01:45:27,833 --> 01:45:28,934
Oh, my God... Oh, my God.

3048
01:45:28,935 --> 01:45:30,101
Look at me. Oh, God.

3049
01:45:30,102 --> 01:45:31,736
Look at me. Are you okay?
Oh, God,

3050
01:45:31,737 --> 01:45:32,904
I think I'm gonna throw up.

3051
01:45:32,905 --> 01:45:34,706
My God, it was a
really bad headbutt.

3052
01:45:34,707 --> 01:45:36,542
Yeah. Yeah. It was good.

3053
01:45:36,543 --> 01:45:37,977
But you're gonna feel it.

3054
01:45:37,978 --> 01:45:39,311
Go, go, go. Get
yourself untied.

3055
01:45:39,312 --> 01:45:40,579
And then we're gonna
go get Jason.

3056
01:45:40,580 --> 01:45:41,846
Okay, got it?

3057
01:45:41,847 --> 01:45:45,150
Why won't they answer my phone?

3058
01:45:45,151 --> 01:45:46,885
Go, go, go, go, go.

3059
01:45:54,292 --> 01:45:55,827
Oh, dickfucker!

3060
01:45:57,965 --> 01:46:00,532
Damn it, get off
the fuckin' phone!

3061
01:46:01,701 --> 01:46:03,268
Useless!

3062
01:46:15,817 --> 01:46:18,352
We got something.

3063
01:46:18,353 --> 01:46:20,354
I got it. I got it. Get
her on the stretcher.

3064
01:46:20,355 --> 01:46:22,022
No, no, I got it.

3065
01:46:22,023 --> 01:46:24,291
I got it! I got it,
I got it, I got it.

3066
01:46:24,292 --> 01:46:25,258
Okay, thank you.

3067
01:46:25,259 --> 01:46:27,127
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

3068
01:46:27,128 --> 01:46:28,996
Oh, crap.

3069
01:46:28,997 --> 01:46:30,130
There you go. Oh, crap.

3070
01:46:30,131 --> 01:46:32,200
All right, got to turn.

3071
01:46:32,201 --> 01:46:33,101
Call 911.

3072
01:46:33,102 --> 01:46:34,335
You won't shoot me?

3073
01:46:34,336 --> 01:46:36,637
Well, just... yeah,
call it, call it.

3074
01:46:39,206 --> 01:46:41,141
Where's my brother,
you asshole?

3075
01:46:41,142 --> 01:46:43,544
Okay, you know, it's that kind
of language from your family

3076
01:46:43,545 --> 01:46:46,247
that forced us to move him to
the east wing of the hospital.

3077
01:46:46,248 --> 01:46:48,416
I don't know why...
Move, dipshit!

3078
01:46:48,417 --> 01:46:49,651
Jason, I'm coming!

3079
01:46:49,652 --> 01:46:51,686
What the fuck?

3080
01:46:53,689 --> 01:46:55,255
Come on, come on.

3081
01:46:57,025 --> 01:46:59,560
Stupid, stupid chair!

3082
01:46:59,561 --> 01:47:01,396
Screw it.

3083
01:47:20,150 --> 01:47:22,786
Eee... Eee...

3084
01:47:22,787 --> 01:47:24,853
Eee...

3085
01:47:24,854 --> 01:47:27,423
Shit. You know,

3086
01:47:27,424 --> 01:47:30,326
it's amazing what a little air

3087
01:47:30,327 --> 01:47:33,163
in the bloodstream does
to the human heart.

3088
01:47:33,164 --> 01:47:34,564
You may not want
to watch this.

3089
01:47:34,565 --> 01:47:36,332
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

3090
01:47:36,333 --> 01:47:39,502
I just want you to know that...
I get it.

3091
01:47:39,503 --> 01:47:42,706
I get it. I mean,
I've been on the...

3092
01:47:42,707 --> 01:47:46,009
Eee... Eee... I've been on
the job a long time, and...

3093
01:47:46,010 --> 01:47:48,646
you just see so many
bad things and...

3094
01:47:48,647 --> 01:47:50,081
and bad people, and you...

3095
01:47:50,082 --> 01:47:52,483
you just start to
wonder if, you know,

3096
01:47:52,484 --> 01:47:55,185
is anybody good
anymore, and...

3097
01:47:55,186 --> 01:47:57,688
I just want you to
know that, you know,

3098
01:47:57,689 --> 01:47:59,323
you don't have to do this.

3099
01:47:59,324 --> 01:48:01,791
You don't have to do it.

3100
01:48:03,294 --> 01:48:05,396
I know.

3101
01:48:05,397 --> 01:48:07,966
But I do, because I have plans

3102
01:48:07,967 --> 01:48:11,435
that don't involve me going to
prison with people I put there.

3103
01:48:11,436 --> 01:48:12,870
So say goodbye

3104
01:48:12,871 --> 01:48:14,971
to your Mick brother.
Wait, wait, wait!

3105
01:48:16,242 --> 01:48:18,677
Drop it, or I'm gonna
fire this weapon.

3106
01:48:18,678 --> 01:48:21,078
Or I inject...

3107
01:48:22,013 --> 01:48:23,582
Oh, you shot him in the dick.

3108
01:48:23,583 --> 01:48:25,584
Twice.

3109
01:48:25,585 --> 01:48:27,119
Oh, shit!

3110
01:48:27,120 --> 01:48:29,821
I took a page right out
of your book, partner.

3111
01:48:29,822 --> 01:48:31,256
Oh, God, but I've
never done it.

3112
01:48:31,257 --> 01:48:33,325
I just... you know, I
just aim it at it.

3113
01:48:33,326 --> 01:48:35,528
I don't actually do it.
That's ffuckin' crazy.

3114
01:48:35,529 --> 01:48:37,864
What about Julian? I
take the bullets out!

3115
01:48:37,865 --> 01:48:40,432
What? I mean, I just use it
as a tactic to scare him.

3116
01:48:40,433 --> 01:48:42,400
I mean, Jesus, I'm
not fuckin' crazy.

3117
01:48:42,401 --> 01:48:45,905
Oh, my God, don't make me feel about it.
God! No, no, I know.

3118
01:48:45,906 --> 01:48:48,106
Hey, no, come...
Ooh, watch that leg.

3119
01:48:50,444 --> 01:48:52,078
You did good, little buddy.

3120
01:48:52,079 --> 01:48:54,946
You saved my brother's life.

3121
01:48:56,617 --> 01:48:58,017
Doing good. Thank you.

3122
01:48:58,018 --> 01:49:00,286
Yeah. Shit.

3123
01:49:00,287 --> 01:49:01,888
Internal Affairs
is going to open

3124
01:49:01,889 --> 01:49:05,626
a toptobottom investigation
of every department now.

3125
01:49:05,627 --> 01:49:06,660
Nice work.

3126
01:49:06,661 --> 01:49:09,495
Well, it was... it was
a team effort, sir.

3127
01:49:09,496 --> 01:49:12,900
Yeah. We put out
an APB on Julian.

3128
01:49:12,901 --> 01:49:15,769
Oh, don't bother,
He's in the trunk.

3129
01:49:15,770 --> 01:49:17,938
Oh, and, uh, sir...

3130
01:49:17,939 --> 01:49:21,575
uh, we're gonna have to reopen
the Red Falls Killer case.

3131
01:49:22,877 --> 01:49:24,745
Good for you.

3132
01:49:24,746 --> 01:49:26,180
I don't know.

3133
01:49:26,181 --> 01:49:29,283
I thought that would feel
good, but it felt awful.

3134
01:49:29,284 --> 01:49:31,052
You know, that's
probably gonna...

3135
01:49:31,053 --> 01:49:33,254
just keep feeling bad.

3136
01:49:33,255 --> 01:49:35,290
I'm glad you did it.

3137
01:49:35,291 --> 01:49:38,259
Should we be leaving the hospital?
Oh, shit. No.

3138
01:49:38,260 --> 01:49:40,195
Probably not. Probably not.

3139
01:49:40,196 --> 01:49:42,463
Spin it, spin it.
Okay, did it, did it.

3140
01:49:42,464 --> 01:49:45,333
Now, let's... let's
take this one though.

3141
01:49:45,334 --> 01:49:47,101
Okay. Is that clean?
Let's get you up here.

3142
01:49:47,102 --> 01:49:48,636
I'll get you...
It's clean enough.

3143
01:49:48,637 --> 01:49:50,272
Oh, my God, that smells. Get
off the leg, get off the leg.

3144
01:49:50,273 --> 01:49:51,774
Like several people
died on here.

3145
01:49:51,775 --> 01:49:53,209
Oh, my... Let me just sit.
Let's get your legs up.

3146
01:49:53,210 --> 01:49:54,676
No, I don't need
to be on my face.

3147
01:49:54,677 --> 01:49:56,244
You know, you can help the process.
Ow! God!

3148
01:49:56,245 --> 01:49:58,179
Not clean. Inchworm it up.

3149
01:49:58,180 --> 01:50:00,049
Come on. Come on. Okay,
okay, that's good.

3150
01:50:00,050 --> 01:50:01,250
Just flip me.

3151
01:50:01,251 --> 01:50:02,885
Get off the leg,
get off the leg,

3152
01:50:02,886 --> 01:50:04,353
off the leg.

3153
01:50:04,354 --> 01:50:06,488
Don'tdon't fall off.
Oh, my God. Okay.

3154
01:50:06,489 --> 01:50:08,425
Okay, I want this place
locked down, people.

3155
01:50:08,426 --> 01:50:10,926
Nobody goes in or out
without talking to me.

3156
01:50:10,927 --> 01:50:12,394
I want you three
stationed at each end

3157
01:50:12,395 --> 01:50:13,896
of the east wing. Let's go.

3158
01:50:13,897 --> 01:50:15,364
All right, let's clear
this hallway, people!

3159
01:50:15,365 --> 01:50:17,534
Let's go! What are you...

3160
01:50:17,535 --> 01:50:19,501
You two, get the
press out of here.

3161
01:50:20,937 --> 01:50:22,072
You okay?

3162
01:50:22,073 --> 01:50:24,773
Yeah, yeah, I'm good, I'm good.

3163
01:50:24,774 --> 01:50:26,810
Yeah, I knew you would be.

3164
01:50:26,811 --> 01:50:28,744
I'm good, too.

3165
01:50:29,646 --> 01:50:30,547
Excuse me.

3166
01:50:30,548 --> 01:50:32,115
You see this woman right here?

3167
01:50:32,116 --> 01:50:34,251
This is one of the best
agents in the FBI.

3168
01:50:34,252 --> 01:50:36,053
You make sure she's
well taken care of.

3169
01:50:36,054 --> 01:50:37,387
All right?

3170
01:50:39,389 --> 01:50:41,391
That was...

3171
01:50:41,392 --> 01:50:43,894
that was... that was
interesting, right?

3172
01:50:43,895 --> 01:50:46,197
I would look into that.
Yeah...

3173
01:50:46,198 --> 01:50:47,665
Oh, God! What is that?

3174
01:50:47,666 --> 01:50:49,667
All right. All right, let's go.
Oh, Christ.

3175
01:50:49,668 --> 01:50:51,869
Um, you actually
have to stay here.

3176
01:50:51,870 --> 01:50:53,404
Why? All right, well, just...

3177
01:50:53,405 --> 01:50:55,539
do what you can
to save that leg.

3178
01:50:55,540 --> 01:50:57,275
Oh, I'm not a doctor.

3179
01:50:57,276 --> 01:50:58,910
All right, fucktard,

3180
01:50:58,911 --> 01:51:01,746
I know you're not a doctor,
but tell it to the doctor.

3181
01:51:01,747 --> 01:51:02,846
How about that?

3182
01:51:05,784 --> 01:51:09,787
All right, I'll wait
right here for you.

3183
01:51:09,788 --> 01:51:11,455
Throw out that sandwich.

3184
01:51:11,456 --> 01:51:13,124
I'll bring you that sandwich!
No!

3185
01:51:13,125 --> 01:51:14,226
Throw it out!

3186
01:51:14,227 --> 01:51:16,094
You got it, buddy.

3187
01:51:16,095 --> 01:51:18,430
<i>For outstanding service,</i>

3188
01:51:18,431 --> 01:51:20,932
Officer Shannon Mullins.

3189
01:51:36,282 --> 01:51:38,151
There you go, Shan!
There you go, Shan!

3190
01:51:38,152 --> 01:51:40,452
That's what I'm talking about!

3191
01:51:40,453 --> 01:51:43,522
There you go, Shannon!

3192
01:51:45,525 --> 01:51:47,993
Hold it up! Hold it up! Yeah!

3193
01:51:59,572 --> 01:52:01,140
Take out the gun.
Take out the gun.

3194
01:52:04,746 --> 01:52:06,580
<i>Just a little snooze, man.</i>

3195
01:52:06,581 --> 01:52:09,382
I'd like to cake toast to Jason.
Cake toast.

3196
01:52:09,383 --> 01:52:11,151
Yeah! To Jason. Yeah, dude.

3197
01:52:11,152 --> 01:52:12,786
May I have your
attention, please?

3198
01:52:12,787 --> 01:52:15,155
I wanted you to have this...
it was your grandmother's.

3199
01:52:15,156 --> 01:52:17,191
Aw. She would've been
very proud of you

3200
01:52:17,192 --> 01:52:19,127
taking care of your brother.

3201
01:52:19,128 --> 01:52:21,162
Yeah, that's...
that's awesome.

3202
01:52:21,163 --> 01:52:22,697
Take a picture.
Take a picture.

3203
01:52:22,698 --> 01:52:26,967
Come on, take a picture. Oh, my God.
Are you serious?

3204
01:52:26,968 --> 01:52:29,036
"Dunkin' Jesus"? Yeah.

3205
01:52:31,640 --> 01:52:33,742
No cell phones.

3206
01:52:33,743 --> 01:52:35,477
How about now?

3207
01:52:35,478 --> 01:52:38,747
Oh, different story? Oh,
come on back. Jesus.

3208
01:52:44,019 --> 01:52:45,553
Ashburn. Hey, it's me.

3209
01:52:45,554 --> 01:52:46,788
Hey!

3210
01:52:46,789 --> 01:52:50,292
So, uh, you getting all
settled in your new digs?

3211
01:52:50,293 --> 01:52:52,261
Yeah, yeah, they're pretty...
pretty sweet.

3212
01:52:52,262 --> 01:52:54,629
Who needed that
promotion anyway?

3213
01:52:54,630 --> 01:52:56,966
I'm glad I stayed around where
all the action is, you know?

3214
01:52:56,967 --> 01:52:59,435
We got a lot of scumbags
we need to take down

3215
01:52:59,436 --> 01:53:00,436
here in Boston, Mullins.

3216
01:53:00,437 --> 01:53:01,437
Yeah, we do, right?

3217
01:53:01,438 --> 01:53:02,772
Hey, uh... Yeah.

3218
01:53:02,773 --> 01:53:04,540
Did you get that
package I sent over?

3219
01:53:04,541 --> 01:53:06,676
Oh! God, I haven't even opened it yet.
I'm sorry.

3220
01:53:06,677 --> 01:53:08,879
It's crazy, 'cause your Dad
sent me something, too, so...

3221
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:11,981
It's, like, the
Mullins' gift day.

3222
01:53:11,982 --> 01:53:12,982
Hold on.

3223
01:53:12,983 --> 01:53:14,116
Oh. Okay.

3224
01:53:14,117 --> 01:53:15,952
I signed... signed it in front.

3225
01:53:15,953 --> 01:53:18,155
Does that mean you broke
into my house again?

3226
01:53:18,156 --> 01:53:19,856
Maybe, maybe not, right?

3227
01:53:19,857 --> 01:53:22,125
Yeah, it's amazing how that door
just opens up all by itself.

3228
01:53:22,126 --> 01:53:23,894
Okay, I see it.
That's very funny.

3229
01:53:23,895 --> 01:53:25,829
No, I know. I was just kidding.

3230
01:53:25,830 --> 01:53:27,431
Just look at the...
look at the back.

3231
01:53:27,432 --> 01:53:29,466
Oh, you wrote
something else mean

3232
01:53:29,467 --> 01:53:31,468
and profanityladen in the back?

3233
01:53:31,469 --> 01:53:33,569
Okay, here it is.

3234
01:53:39,110 --> 01:53:40,243
Well...

3235
01:53:40,244 --> 01:53:42,411
don't make it weird.

3236
01:53:45,383 --> 01:53:47,018
Later, nerd.

3237
01:53:47,019 --> 01:53:49,153
Takes a nerd to know a nerd.

3238
01:53:49,154 --> 01:53:51,055
Okay. You made it weird.

3239
01:53:51,056 --> 01:53:52,857
Bye. Bye.

3240
01:53:54,260 --> 01:53:56,960
I left my baby in the car.

3241
01:54:17,850 --> 01:54:19,318
Hi.

3242
01:54:19,319 --> 01:54:21,287
Hey. There's, uh,
there's been something

3243
01:54:21,288 --> 01:54:24,723
I've been thinking about a lot,
and it's been bothering me,

3244
01:54:24,724 --> 01:54:26,992
and... well, I got
you something.

3245
01:54:26,993 --> 01:54:28,960
Oh. Okay. Oh.

3246
01:54:31,431 --> 01:54:33,633
I found your friend.

3247
01:54:33,634 --> 01:54:35,235
Pumpkin!

3248
01:54:35,236 --> 01:54:36,536
Awesome, right?

3249
01:54:36,537 --> 01:54:38,171
I drove all the way
to New Jersey,

3250
01:54:38,172 --> 01:54:40,640
and I was up and down these
streets and looking all over,

3251
01:54:40,641 --> 01:54:42,475
and, you know, I was
just about to give up,

3252
01:54:42,476 --> 01:54:43,977
and I was over by
your old place.

3253
01:54:43,978 --> 01:54:45,545
All of a sudden I hear
this little Bell,

3254
01:54:45,546 --> 01:54:47,046
and I thought, wait a minute.

3255
01:54:47,047 --> 01:54:48,815
I looked in your neighbor's
window, and I saw

3256
01:54:48,816 --> 01:54:50,284
this asshole sitting
right on the couch.

3257
01:54:50,285 --> 01:54:51,719
I said, "You are
coming with me",

3258
01:54:51,720 --> 01:54:53,787
even if you don't want
to go back with her..."

3259
01:54:53,788 --> 01:54:56,389
Oh, he fought you, huh? Yeah.
Yeah, he fought me.

3260
01:54:56,390 --> 01:54:57,924
Wow. Pretty hard,
but I'm just glad

3261
01:54:57,925 --> 01:55:00,561
that, you know, I could
kind of make this...

3262
01:55:00,562 --> 01:55:01,795
reuniting... Yeah. Oh, wow.

3263
01:55:01,796 --> 01:55:04,665
What a surprise this is. Huh.

3264
01:55:04,666 --> 01:55:06,834
What a surprise, huh?

3265
01:55:06,835 --> 01:55:09,271
Look at where you are.

3266
01:55:09,272 --> 01:55:11,672
This was never your cat, was it?
Yeah, no, no, no, it isn't.

3267
01:55:11,673 --> 01:55:14,074
Goddamn it, put him in the box.
Put him in the box.

3268
01:55:14,075 --> 01:55:17,077
Oh, can you... can
you put him back?

3269
01:55:17,078 --> 01:55:19,781
I... well, do I have a lot of choice?
Well, can you...

3270
01:55:19,782 --> 01:55:21,516
make sure he's got...
lot of water?

3271
01:55:21,517 --> 01:55:23,018
Just don't. He
likes to snuggle.

3272
01:55:23,019 --> 01:55:25,285
Don't make me put the
cat down and punch you.
