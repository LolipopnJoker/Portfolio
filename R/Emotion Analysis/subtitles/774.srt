1
00:02:18,809 --> 00:02:20,809
Max!

2
00:02:25,376 --> 00:02:27,034
Come here.

3
00:02:27,134 --> 00:02:30,070
Let's not make the sisters wait.

4
00:02:34,248 --> 00:02:37,354
This is Frey.

5
00:02:37,805 --> 00:02:41,439
She's new here too.

6
00:02:46,119 --> 00:02:48,142
Can you read?

7
00:02:53,263 --> 00:02:56,600
This is a giraffe.
They lived in Africa.

8
00:02:56,601 --> 00:02:57,953
Can you read?

9
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:00,053
Yes.

10
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,624
Max, are you stealing again?

11
00:03:33,861 --> 00:03:38,759
It breaks my heart. Why do you do it?

12
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,501
To save up?

13
00:03:40,601 --> 00:03:45,000
You want to buy a ticket to go up there?

14
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,600
That place is not for you, or me.

15
00:04:00,603 --> 00:04:03,300
It's not fair, sister.

16
00:04:03,301 --> 00:04:04,901
Why can't I go?

17
00:04:05,001 --> 00:04:07,501
There are things that can't be explained in life.

18
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:10,500
We just have to accept them.

19
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:13,600
But one thing I know for sure.

20
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:16,785
You're a very special person.

21
00:04:16,854 --> 00:04:20,400
One day you'll do something marvellous.

22
00:04:20,401 --> 00:04:23,380
You were born for it.

23
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,903
My little Max.

24
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,500
Max, very good!

25
00:05:14,566 --> 00:05:16,543
Wanna make the world better?

26
00:05:22,542 --> 00:05:25,517
Please kids! You think I got money?

27
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:46,608
I can buy my ticket to Elysium, huh?

28
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:18,440
Tag her quick!

29
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,886
Hello, Madame Delacourt.
- Hello.

30
00:13:26,986 --> 00:13:29,284
Hi, Ivan, how you've grown.

31
00:13:29,285 --> 00:13:30,447
Hi. You alright?

32
00:13:30,547 --> 00:13:33,700
Fine. Are the kids here?
- Yes, with Dominica.

33
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,751
I have a present for you.
Wanna see? It's in the salon.

34
00:13:36,851 --> 00:13:39,693
Go get it with your mother.

35
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,605
It's, by the canape.
- OK

36
00:13:41,705 --> 00:13:43,705
Bye.

37
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,346
<i>Impact imminent. Nine.

38
00:16:25,781 --> 00:16:26,681
Eight.

39
00:16:26,781 --> 00:16:27,681
Seven.

40
00:16:27,781 --> 00:16:28,681
Six.

41
00:16:28,781 --> 00:16:29,681
Five.

42
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:30,681
Four.

43
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:31,681
Three.

44
00:16:31,781 --> 00:16:32,681
Two.

45
00:16:32,781 --> 00:16:34,781
One.

46
00:17:03,114 --> 00:17:05,178
Only one made it.

47
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,700
As usual, the police man.

48
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,240
<i>Attention, doors are not aligned. Worker attend.

49
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:25,620
<i>Sister, they beat me up.

50
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,177
<i>I only want to live there.

51
00:23:31,002 --> 00:23:34,657
<i>See how beautiful it looks to us down here?

52
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,913
<i>Yes.

53
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,834
<i>Well, now...

54
00:23:39,934 --> 00:23:43,589
<i>See how beautiful we look to them up there.

55
00:23:45,811 --> 00:23:47,001
<i>Keep this.

56
00:23:47,101 --> 00:23:49,740
<i>Now it belongs to you.

57
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:54,011
<i>So you never forget where you come from.

58
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,737
Go! Get to work, Mr. Carlyle.

59
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
<i>Lower it to me.

60
00:39:42,283 --> 00:39:44,283
He's awake!

61
00:42:22,474 --> 00:42:24,474
Yes

62
00:43:02,356 --> 00:43:04,906
I'm shitting myself with fear.

63
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Thanks ma'am.

64
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:08,731
You're too heavy for me. Max, help me!

65
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,800
What is this?

66
01:11:22,204 --> 01:11:25,236
Guy.

67
01:38:53,142 --> 01:38:56,286
<i>We all have something special, Max.

68
01:38:56,864 --> 01:38:59,599
<i>Something we're destined to do.

69
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:02,705
<i>Something for which we were born.

70
01:39:59,144 --> 01:40:01,237
My baby. My dear.

71
01:41:27,874 --> 01:41:31,912
<i>See how beautiful it looks to us down here?

72
01:41:31,949 --> 01:41:35,401
<i>Now look how beautiful we look from up there.

73
01:41:35,501 --> 01:41:37,600
<i>Now it belongs to you.

74
01:41:37,946 --> 01:41:41,601
<i>So you'll never forget where you come from.

75
01:41:53,599 --> 01:41:55,845
<i>My little Max.
