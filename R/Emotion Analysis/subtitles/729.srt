00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:57,482
# Hot town,
summer in the city #

2
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,956
# Back of my neck
gettin' dirt and gritty #

3
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,857
# Been down,
isn't it a pity? #

4
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:04,327
# Doesn't seem to be
a shadow in the city #

5
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:06,228
#All around,
people lookin' half-dead #

6
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:09,665
#Walkin' on the sidewalk
hotter than a match-head #

7
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:11,930
# Come night,
it's a different world #

8
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:13,733
# Goin' off to find a girl #

9
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,967
# Come on, come on,
and dance all night #

10
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,703
# Despite the heat
it'll be all right #

11
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,574
#And, babe, don't you know
it's a pity #

12
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:22,045
#That the days
can't be like the nights #

13
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:24,139
# In the summer
in the city #

14
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,650
# In the summer
in the city #

15
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,653
# Cool town,
meetin' in the city #

16
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,882
# Dressed so fine
and lookin' so pretty #

17
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,049
# Cool cat
lookin' for a kitty #

18
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,320
# Gonna look in every
corner of the city #

19
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,725
#Turn round,
wheezing at the bus stop #

20
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:37,728
# Runnin- ##

21
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:56,845
Alan, Bomb Squad,
Special Services,

22
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,783
State Police,
and the FBI.

23
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:01,285
LieutenantJurgensen,
Plummer,

24
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:02,786
Go to St. John's emergency

25
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:06,290
in case we got any walk-ins
from the street.

26
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:08,292
Kramer,
get the city engineer.

27
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:10,794
I got to find out
our damage report.

28
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:12,296
Bonwit Teller.

29
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:15,299
Who would want to blow up
a department store?

30
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:18,302
Ever see a woman
miss a shoe sale?

31
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:19,803
Ricky, you and Joe

32
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:22,807
make sure the uniforms
get it cordoned off there

33
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:25,810
and don't let
the damn TV crews in.

34
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:26,810
Inspector, phone.

35
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:28,312
Not now. Benson, traffic!

36
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:30,780
Get 5th avenue
cleared up by 3:00,

37
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:33,284
or we got
the traffic jam from hell.

38
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:34,284
Walter.

39
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:35,285
Yeah.

40
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:37,447
I think you'd
better take this.

41
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:42,326
Major Case Unit.
Inspector Cobb.

42
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:46,330
Said Simple Simon to the pie man
going to the fair,

43
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:47,831
"Give me your pies...

44
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:49,834
or I'll cave
your head in. "

45
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:54,339
You see, Bonwit's was just to
make sure I had your attention.

46
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,772
Is there a detective
named McClane there?

47
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,274
He's on suspension.

48
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,278
No, Walter. He's not.

49
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,278
Not today.

50
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:02,780
Who is this?

51
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:04,281
Call me Simon.

52
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:05,783
What do you want?

53
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:08,285
I want to play
a game.

54
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:09,787
What kind of game?

55
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:11,288
Simon says.

56
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:14,792
Simon's going to tell
Lieutenant McClane what to do,

57
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:18,295
and Lieutenant McClane
is going to do it.

58
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:21,299
Noncompliance will
result in a penalty.

59
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,301
What penalty?

60
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:26,463
Another big bang
in a very public place.

61
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:32,310
What is it that you want
Lieutenant McClane to do?

62
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:34,312
Simon says
Lieutenant McClane

63
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:37,815
is to go to the corner of 138th street
und Amsterdam,

64
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:40,909
which is in Harlem,
if I'm not mistaken.

65
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:41,918
Kowalski!

66
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:43,989
Lambert! You know
where to find McClane?

67
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,786
I kind of doubt
you'll find him in church.

68
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:50,329
Well, you better find out
what rock he's under...

69
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,829
and kick it over.

70
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,369
John.

71
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:07,573
Thanks.

72
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:15,979
A few more.

73
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,560
Jesus,John.
You look like shit.

74
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:28,799
Where did we leave off
with that roster?

75
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:32,302
We got three killings
in Redhook the past two nights.

76
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:34,669
Put Minor on it.
And Genetti.

77
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,675
The Mayor's Office will call
before the day's out.

78
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:41,304
Next-14 dump trucks stolen from a yard
in Staten Island.

79
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,314
14-Jesus!

80
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,316
Are they starting
a construction company?

81
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:46,749
No, it was
John's landlady

82
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,616
going to clean
his apartment.

83
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:51,822
Insurance fraud.

84
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:54,324
That's a priority
out in California.

85
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:57,260
Contractor splits the money
with the thieves.

86
00:04:57,363 --> 00:05:01,265
We had that out in Jersey
a couple of years ago,Joe.

87
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:03,767
See what Kelly
can do with it.

88
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,839
Hey, what was the lottery number
last night?

89
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,804
4667. 4667. 4667.

90
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:12,844
You still betting
your badge, Rick?

91
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:14,276
Yeah.

92
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,780
6991 every week.

93
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,783
6991. Lucky number.

94
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:21,877
Half the cops in New York
play their badges.

95
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,956
How are the kids,John?

96
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:27,291
They're O.K.

97
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:28,291
Ahem.

98
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:30,521
Did you talk
with Holly?

99
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,458
No, I didn't talk
to Holly.

100
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:37,661
Coming up on it,
Inspector.

101
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,806
Hot in here,
or am I just scared to death?

102
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:44,035
Make sure
the gun's secure.

103
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:45,838
Yeah. It's good.

104
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,688
You're the first woman
since Holly

105
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:57,119
to see me do this.

106
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:59,088
I'm honored.

107
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,250
Yeah...

108
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,554
So was she.

109
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:08,133
So... where's the backup
going to be?

110
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,465
We're going to draw back
to 128th street.

111
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:15,666
What?

112
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:19,275
10 blocks?
You fucking kidding me?

113
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,279
Oh, man.
That's just great.

114
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,145
Walter, what is
all this about, huh?

115
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,775
If we don't do
what this guy says,

116
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,285
he'll blow up
another place.

117
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,821
Well, why me?

118
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:33,790
I have no idea.
He just said it had to be you.

119
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,793
It's nice
to be needed.

120
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,419
Frankly,John-

121
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,294
Hey, Walter, how about you mind
your fucking business

122
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,697
about Holly, huh?

123
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:45,293
This Simon is fucking up
a perfectly good hangover.

124
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,306
O.K.

125
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,751
We'll be back
to pick you up

126
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:02,252
in 15 minutes.

127
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:03,754
Take your time.

128
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:06,654
I expect to be dead
in four.

129
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,056
Let's go, Billy!

130
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:00,577
Hey, yo, Uncle!

131
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,580
Come look at this!

132
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:05,583
It's 10 after 9:00.
Why aren't you in school?

133
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,380
Tony wants to
sell you this.

134
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,217
Tony. That no-neck dude
they call Bad T?

135
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,588
He says he found it
in a dumpster.

136
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:16,628
He keeps stealing,
he'll be found in a dumpster.

137
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:19,664
He didn't steal it.
Says his uncle gave it to him.

138
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:22,359
Mm-hmm. Hand me
that newspaper over there.

139
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:26,336
Don't ever let
people use you.

140
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:29,340
You're running all over town
with stolen property.

141
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:30,636
If you get caught,

142
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:33,644
you're in trouble while he denies
the whole thing.

143
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:36,544
You mean you want us
to take it back to Tony?

144
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:39,277
No. I'll take it
back to Tony...

145
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:41,285
with a message.

146
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:42,786
Now, where you going?

147
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,151
- Why?
- School.

148
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:45,451
- Why?
- To get educated.

149
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:47,617
So we can go
to college.

150
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:49,126
And why is that
important?

151
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:50,286
To get 'espect.

152
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:52,057
Respect.
Who's the bad guys?

153
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:53,461
Guys who sell drugs.

154
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:54,624
Guys who have guns.

155
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:55,792
Who are the good guys?

156
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:56,869
We're the good guys.

157
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:58,027
Who's going to help you?

158
00:08:58,137 --> 00:08:59,035
Nobody.

159
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:00,400
Who's going to help you?

160
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:01,473
We'll help ourselves.

161
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:04,042
Who do we not want
to help us?

162
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,043
- White people.
- White people.

163
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:09,581
That's right. Get on out of here.
Go to school.

164
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,514
Uncle, you better
come look at this.

165
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:16,519
What?

166
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:18,590
A white man
in the street.

167
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:19,658
I've seen one.

168
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,522
Not like this.

169
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,268
Dial 911.

170
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:35,272
Tell the police
to get up here quick.

171
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:37,239
Somebody's about
to get killed.

172
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:40,335
And get your butts to school.
You hear me?

173
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:41,344
Yeah.

174
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:42,414
All right.

175
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:48,046
Back off, man.

176
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:07,599
Morning.

177
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,466
Good morning.

178
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:13,306
You having
a nice day, sir?

179
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:14,640
You feeling all right?

180
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,146
Not to get too personal,

181
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:18,148
but a white man in Harlem

182
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,650
wearing a sign that says,
"I hate niggers"

183
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,812
has either got serious
personal issues,

184
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:25,413
or not all his dogs
are barking.

185
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:27,651
Hey, I'm talking to you!

186
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,489
You got about 10 seconds

187
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:30,994
before those guys
see you,

188
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:33,497
and when they do,
they will kill you.

189
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,497
You understand?

190
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,831
You are about to have
a very bad day.

191
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:39,336
Tell me about it.

192
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:42,771
Sir, this is a police matter.
For your own safety-

193
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,775
Damn right
it's a police matter.

194
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:47,277
I suggest you hide
your butt in my shop

195
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,506
till the police
get here.

196
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:50,013
What the fuck?

197
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,476
Oh, shit.

198
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:03,294
Listen, I'm a cop.
I'm on a case.

199
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,261
Somebody blew up Bonwit Teller's
an hour ago.

200
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:06,797
Did you hear
about that?

201
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:10,562
Same asshole that did that
said I got to do this

202
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,638
or he's going to blow up
something else.

203
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:14,638
You should get
across the street.

204
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,298
Start acting crazy,
like loony tunes,

205
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:17,307
like Bellevue.

206
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,605
Hey, Zeus.
This your friend?

207
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:22,146
He look like
a friend of mine?

208
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,978
I think the dude just escaped
from some hospital,

209
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,483
you know,
like Bellevue?

210
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:33,688
I am the...

211
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,055
voice of my own God.

212
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:38,324
I told the librarian
that I had a bad headache,

213
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:39,830
but she didn't
believe me.

214
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:42,833
I really do have a bad headache,
a very bad headache!

215
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:44,061
My head does not-

216
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,068
Shut the fuck up!

217
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,407
You've made
a very bad mistake.

218
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:49,838
Bouya his ass.

219
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,842
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha!

220
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:53,343
Cut that shit off.

221
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:54,845
Fellas, fellas!

222
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:56,346
Nature boy here
hates niggers.

223
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,747
What are we going
to do about that?

224
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,785
Hold up, hold up,
hold up!

225
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,080
Oh, shit!

226
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:09,019
Back! Back up!

227
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:11,289
Back the fuck up!

228
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,295
Now!

229
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,094
Come on, man,
get up.

230
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,066
Get out of here!

231
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:20,730
Stop the cab-
stop the goddamn cab!

232
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,273
Don't shoot me!

233
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:24,808
Get up! Come on, get up!

234
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,309
Back off.
I mean it!

235
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,074
I don't want to,
but I will.

236
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:30,808
Go, go!

237
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,316
Get the fuck
out of here!

238
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,320
Don't stop. Don't stop.
Just keep driving.

239
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,821
Run the red light!

240
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,823
Here, man.
That's all I got.

241
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,825
Put that fucking
money away.

242
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,827
Just run all the lights.
Drive.

243
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,328
You got it, boss.

244
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,830
That cut deep?

245
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,832
How the hell
would I know?

246
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,299
Just keep pressure
on it.

247
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:51,334
Oh, fuck!

248
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,838
Jesus, right?
John McClane. I owe you.

249
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,339
Damn right you owe me!

250
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,774
Know what they're doing
to my shop right now?

251
00:12:58,878 --> 00:12:59,845
Chill out.

252
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,776
Chill out?
Are you trying to relate to me?

253
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,041
Talk like a white man.

254
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:04,275
Look,Jesus,
I'm sorry-

255
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,318
Why you keep calling meJesus?
I look Puerto Rican?

256
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,284
Guy back there
called you Jesus.

257
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:11,788
He said, " Hey, Zeus. "
My name is Zeus.

258
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:12,789
Zeus?

259
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:15,292
As in father of Apollo,
Mount Olympus?

260
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:16,793
Don't-fuck-with-me-

261
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:20,662
or-I'll-shove- a-lightning-bolt-
up-your-ass Zeus!

262
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:22,529
You got a problem
with that?

263
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,796
No. I don't have
a problem with that.

264
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:26,303
Downtown. Police Plaza.

265
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:27,997
Oh, ho. Oh.
That's just great.

266
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:34,612
Record of all callers...

267
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:40,810
Textbook megalomania.

268
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,319
It's a pathological state

269
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:45,322
in which fantasies of control
or omnipotence predominate.

270
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:46,914
He wants control
over him,

271
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:49,927
over his actions, over his thoughts,
even his emotions.

272
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,826
Sounds like
a secret admirer,John.

273
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,831
Yeah. Maybe he'll
send me flowers.

274
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,833
Everybody knows
you like pansies.

275
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,300
It's not that kind
of emotion.

276
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:58,529
This guy is ugly.

277
00:13:58,637 --> 00:13:59,695
How is that?

278
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:02,638
Nothing wrong with him
a shower wouldn't cure.

279
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:04,800
Beer's normally taken internally,
John.

280
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,276
Just give me some aspirins,
will you?

281
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:08,676
O.K. Hold this here.

282
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:10,715
This is Fred Schiller,John,

283
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:12,283
and he's a-

284
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:13,783
Shrink.
Yeah, I got it.

285
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:15,547
Yes. I was saying that

286
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:17,451
we're dealing
with a megalomaniacal personality

287
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:18,784
with possible paranoid
schizophrenic-

288
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:21,291
Skip to the part
where you tell me

289
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:24,294
what the fuck this
has to do with me.

290
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:25,624
I don't know,

291
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:28,131
but it does have specifically
to do with you.

292
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:31,135
This guy wants to pound you
till you crumble,

293
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:33,137
dance to his tune,
then-

294
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,207
Put on a dress
and fuck me?

295
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:38,208
I was going to say
kill you.

296
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,211
He's sitting on
an awful lot of rage,

297
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:44,544
and it could be manifested physically
if he's stressed.

298
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,118
Somebody he arrested,
somebody he pissed off?

299
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,312
That could be
one long list.

300
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:50,820
Fuck you,Joe.

301
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,823
These people don't like
to work anonymously.

302
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:56,326
They want you to know
who's doing it.

303
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:58,055
This name Simon is probably
not an alias.

304
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:00,097
It's probably Simon
or some variation.

305
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:01,860
"Simon, Robert E.
Busted in '86.

306
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,366
Extortion. Kidnapping.
10 to 15.

307
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,266
Did seven years
for good behavior.

308
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:08,807
Released on a state work furlough
two months ago. "

309
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,274
Thanks. Bob Simon
was a bankrupt businessman

310
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:12,776
who kidnapped
his partner's daughter.

311
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:14,778
He's a fuckup,
not a psycho.

312
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,847
The other guy's nuts.

313
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:18,849
A nut who knows
a lot about bombs.

314
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,782
We found this
in a playground.

315
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:22,786
Professional.
Very cool stuff.

316
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:24,287
You know, boom.

317
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,291
Think you should slam it around
like that, Charlie?

318
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,020
It's unmixed.
Can't hurt it.

319
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,688
This stuff is cutting edge,
a binary liquid.

320
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:32,855
A what?

321
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:34,592
Like epoxy.

322
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,167
Two liquids.

323
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:39,362
Either one
by itself...

324
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:42,306
you got nothing.

325
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,137
But mix them...

326
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:56,615
Ricky.

327
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:01,084
Aah!

328
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:03,991
Charlie, you'll be wearing that chair
up your ass!

329
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:05,927
Christ almighty, Charlie!

330
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:07,931
Like I said,
very cool stuff.

331
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:09,432
With a package
like this,

332
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:10,763
you get a warning.

333
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:12,769
The bomb
has to arm itself.

334
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:15,271
The red liquid
pumps into the clear

335
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:16,602
before it detonates.

336
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,108
How long before?

337
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,007
10 seconds, 2 minutes.

338
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:21,511
Could be anything.

339
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:23,740
But once it's mixed...

340
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:25,111
be somewhere else.

341
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:27,617
This stuff has got
to be pretty rare.

342
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,450
Find out if any of it's
missing someplace.

343
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,786
Livermore labs-
theft over the weekend.

344
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:35,155
Got enough to make
another one,Joe?

345
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,091
About 2,000 pounds.

346
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,424
Of that?

347
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,589
The detonating mechanism
can be anything-

348
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:41,927
radio, electrical.

349
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:44,935
You could use a beeper
and phone it in.

350
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:46,095
Inspector!
It's him.

351
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,435
He's got a feedback
loop on it.

352
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,768
A nasty
little trick-

353
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,308
Charlie. Charlie.

354
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,468
What?

355
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,512
Want to start the trace?

356
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:03,887
Simon.

357
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:07,220
He bought a board, walked the street,
and survived.

358
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:10,727
Where are my pigeons now?

359
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,558
Pigeons?

360
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:15,064
I had two pigeons,
bright and gay,

361
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,566
fly from me the other day.

362
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:18,363
Why was it
that they did go?

363
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,028
You cannot tell.
You do not know.

364
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:21,697
You mean McClane.

365
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:24,367
No. I mean Santa Claus.

366
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:27,710
Yeah, I'm here.

367
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,212
Ah. There after all.

368
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:30,713
And your friend?

369
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:33,546
Come on.
We need you in the other room.

370
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:35,051
Let's go. Come on.

371
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:37,054
They need you. Go.

372
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:38,453
Yeah, he's here, too.

373
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,990
May I speak with him?

374
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:44,327
Well, is the ebony samaritan
there now?

375
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,330
You got a problem
with ebony?

376
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,332
No, no. My only problem is

377
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,334
that I went
to some trouble

378
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:51,835
preparing that game
for McClane.

379
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:54,167
You interfered
with a well-laid plan.

380
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,332
You can stick
your well-laid plan

381
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:57,773
up your well-laid ass.

382
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:01,778
That was not smart.

383
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,110
There are lives
at stake here.

384
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:05,843
Not enough time,
Inspector.

385
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,112
You better hope
he calls back.

386
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,744
He will.

387
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:12,351
Ricky, tell those people

388
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,052
to shut the hell up
out there!

389
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,559
Hey! Keep it down here!

390
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:27,800
Simon.

391
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:30,136
He wasn't speaking
for all of us.

392
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:31,470
That was unpleasant.

393
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:32,976
Don't let it
happen again.

394
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:34,807
So what's your name,
boy?

395
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,312
Don't call me boy.

396
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,646
I'm sorry.
It was a poor attempt at humor.

397
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:42,151
I would send you home
with a chiding,

398
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:44,484
but now I think
you should join the game.

399
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,854
We got him.
A pay phone in Oslo.

400
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,256
Wait. They say it's Mexico.

401
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,258
Norway?

402
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:51,591
Now they're saying
it's Juarez, Mexico.

403
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:52,721
Forget it.

404
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:54,230
He's scrambling up
the system.

405
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,766
They don't know
where he is.

406
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,701
Having fun with the phone company,
are we?

407
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,034
Simon says McClane
and the samaritan

408
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,040
will go to
the subway station

409
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,370
at 72nd and Broadway.

410
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,376
I'll call you
in 15 minutes

411
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,708
on the pay phone
outside the station.

412
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:09,906
No police.

413
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:12,074
Failure to answer will constitute
noncompliance.

414
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:14,414
Do you understand me,John?

415
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,078
Oh, yes, I understand.

416
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:18,088
I understand
you're a fucking wacko

417
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,090
who likes to play
kid's games.

418
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:21,090
Hardly.

419
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:22,160
Hardly?

420
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,661
Then who are you,
somebody I sent up?

421
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:27,823
What did you do, shoplifting,
purse snatching...

422
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:29,161
cross-dressing, what?

423
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:31,168
You c-c-couldn't
catch me

424
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:34,330
if I stole your ch-chair
with you in it.

425
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:37,169
My ch-ch-chair
with me in it?

426
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,676
Let me ask you
a question, bonehead-

427
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:42,178
Why are you trying
to k-k-k-kill me?

428
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:44,010
John,John,
calm yourself.

429
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,016
Why don't you
come down here

430
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:48,678
and we'll figure this out
like men?

431
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:51,017
If killing you
was all I wanted,

432
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:52,522
you'd be dead by now.

433
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:54,182
Simon, this is Inspector Cobb.

434
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:56,523
I can appreciate your feelings
for McClane,

435
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:59,028
but believe me,
the jerk isn't worth it.

436
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:02,032
He stepped on so many toes
in this department,

437
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:04,364
next month he'll be
a security guard.

438
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:06,869
His wife wants nothing
to do with him,

439
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:09,873
and he's two steps shy
of becoming an alcoholic.

440
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:12,307
One step, one step.

441
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,140
Now listen to me.

442
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:16,646
You sound like a real smart guy.

443
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:18,306
What is it you want?

444
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,317
Are you talking
about money?

445
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,979
Well, whatever, whatever.

446
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:25,181
McClane is a toilet bug.

447
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,019
Now what would it take

448
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:30,026
just to forget him
and live happily ever after?

449
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:31,527
Money is shit to me.

450
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,530
I would not give up McClane

451
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:36,032
for all the gold
in your Fort Knox.

452
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:38,898
72nd street subway, pay phone,
15 minutes.

453
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,403
McClane and the samaritan.

454
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:42,405
If you're competent
in the least,

455
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:43,735
you've found the briefcase,

456
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:47,243
so you know what
I mean by penalty.

457
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,681
I want to thank you for that vote
of confidence.

458
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:54,013
I thought it was
worth a try.

459
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,586
This guy's a raving maniac.

460
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:57,086
He couldn't be any clearer.

461
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,749
He gave you clues
to his identity,

462
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:01,086
he spoke German,

463
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,252
he called it
your Fort Knox,

464
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,762
and he stammered when McClane
pushed him.

465
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:08,560
You believe this guy
really can't be bought?

466
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:11,568
The very mention of money only
enraged him further.

467
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:20,910
What's that?

468
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,913
It's your shield.

469
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:25,916
You asking me
to be a cop again?

470
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:27,576
Ricky, get him his gun.

471
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:29,415
Hey!

472
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:32,615
You didn't answer
my question, Walter.

473
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:34,624
Are you done, Lieutenant?

474
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:37,126
You two better get going

475
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,424
to get to 72nd street
on time.

476
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:40,964
Joe, they go with backup.

477
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:42,294
You got it.

478
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,801
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'm not going anywhere.

479
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:46,803
Simon says you got to go.

480
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:49,305
I'm not jumping through
hoops for some psycho.

481
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:51,808
That's a white man
with white problems.

482
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,310
Call me when he crosses
11 Oth street.

483
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:55,641
Hey.

484
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:57,112
Why'd you save my ass?

485
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:58,182
I didn't.

486
00:21:58,283 --> 00:21:59,682
I stopped a white cop

487
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:01,184
from getting killed in Harlem.

488
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:03,015
One white cop
gets killed today,

489
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:05,021
tomorrow we got
1,000 white cops,

490
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:08,024
all of them with itchy trigger fingers,
got it?

491
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:11,520
Get him back.

492
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:14,621
Where'd you find
that bomb?

493
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:16,166
Chinatown.

494
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:18,259
Shit.

495
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,203
Yo. Yo, partner.
Wait up.

496
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:23,206
Hey, hey,
I ain't your partner,

497
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:26,175
your neighbor, your brother,
or your friend.

498
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:27,677
I'm your total stranger.

499
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:30,179
O.K., stranger.

500
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:32,182
You know where that park is

501
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:33,945
at 115th street
and St. Nicholas?

502
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:37,385
Yeah. That's in Harlem.

503
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:39,889
Where do you think
we found that bomb?

504
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:41,219
Listen,

505
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:44,056
this guy doesn't care
about skin color,

506
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:45,629
even if you do.

507
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,061
What am I doing?

508
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:51,226
Cheer up. Things could be worse.

509
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:53,736
I was working
on a nice fat suspension,

510
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:56,239
smoking cigarettes and watching
Captain Kangaroo.

511
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,672
Come on.

512
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:08,977
O.K. They made it
to the phone,

513
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:10,315
but there's a problem.

514
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:11,650
How big a problem?

515
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:13,816
Oh, about 300 pounds.

516
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:16,155
Excuse me, ma'am.
We need this phone

517
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:17,489
for official
police business.

518
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:19,996
Honey, I'm a cop.
I need the phone.

519
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:22,498
Get off the damn phone, lady.
Police business.

520
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:23,829
Well, I never.

521
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:25,835
I can get used to this.

522
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:27,996
Find a phone across the street.

523
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:29,505
I'm the only one here

524
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:30,836
on official police business.

525
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:32,341
Don't do that shit again.

526
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:33,843
Let's get something
else straight-

527
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:36,505
you need me
more than I need you.

528
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:40,016
You don't like the way
I do things? I quit.

529
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:49,357
All right, I need you.

530
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,791
I need you more
than you need me.

531
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:03,235
Hello.

532
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:05,070
Birds of a feather
flock together.

533
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:06,576
So do pigs and swine.

534
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:08,873
Rats and mice
have their chance,

535
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,379
as will I have mine.

536
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:11,540
Nice. Rhymes.

537
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,210
Why was the phone busy?
Who were you calling?

538
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:15,547
The psychic hot line.

539
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:18,054
I'd advise you
to take this more seriously.

540
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:19,384
What should I say?

541
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:22,153
Simply say there was
a fat woman on it,

542
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,161
and it took a minute
to get her off.

543
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:28,664
Now,John, there's a significant amount
of explosive

544
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:32,168
in the trash receptacle
next to you.

545
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,670
Try to run,
and it goes off now.

546
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:37,333
I got a hundred
people out here.

547
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:38,841
That's the point.

548
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:41,003
Now do I
have your attention?

549
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:42,670
As I was going to St. Ives,

550
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:44,009
I met a man
with seven wives.

551
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:46,515
Every wife had seven sacks.
Every sack had seven cats.

552
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:48,017
Every cat
had seven kittens.

553
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,848
Kittens, cats,
sacks, and wives.

554
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:51,513
How many were going
to St. Ives?

555
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:52,851
My phone number is 555-

556
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:55,188
I didn't get that!
Say it again!

557
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:56,521
Not a chance.

558
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:57,617
But I didn't-

559
00:24:57,729 --> 00:24:59,959
My phone number
is 555 and the answer.

560
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:02,295
Call me in 30 seconds
or die.

561
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:05,832
All right, seven guys
with seven wives-

562
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:07,165
Shut up, McClane.

563
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:08,637
Seven guys
with seven wives-

564
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,970
He said seven wives
with seven sacks.

565
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:13,977
7 times 7 is 49.
Tell me the rest.

566
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,478
A sack with-
seven sacks-

567
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,810
Weren't you listening?
What's wrong with you?

568
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:19,543
A bad hangover, for one!

569
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:22,211
All right.
7 wives times 7-49,

570
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,719
with seven cats-

571
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,380
7 times 49 is 343, right?

572
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,718
Asking me
or telling me?

573
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:29,726
I'm telling you.
343 times 7 is...

574
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:31,227
21 and a 0... 24.

575
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:32,728
2,401.
What you got, right?

576
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:33,889
Yeah.

577
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:35,227
Is that it? 2401?

578
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:38,734
That's it. Dial 555-2401.

579
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:42,230
No, wait, wait!
It's a trick.

580
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,864
I forgot about the man.

581
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:46,205
Fuck the man!
We got 10 seconds!

582
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:49,212
He said how many
were going to St. Ives.

583
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:52,442
The riddle begins,
"as I was going to St. Ives. "

584
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,950
The wives aren't
going anywhere.

585
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,280
What are they doing?

586
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,218
How the hell
should I know?

587
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:59,222
Well, who's going to St. Ives?

588
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:00,222
The guy.

589
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:01,724
Just one guy?

590
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:03,225
The answer's 1.

591
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:04,727
How do you dial 1?

592
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:05,853
555-0001.

593
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:07,864
001.Just one guy's going.

594
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:08,864
Hello,John.

595
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:10,195
Yeah, piece of cake.

596
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:12,202
Give us something
harder next time.

597
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:13,703
But you're 10 seconds late.

598
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:15,500
No, no!
The answer is 1!

599
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:18,599
There's a bomb in the trash can!
Get down!

600
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:25,545
Get down! There's a bomb!

601
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:30,211
Welcome to New York.

602
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,889
Yeah. Get up. Come on.

603
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:38,223
Come on. Let's go.

604
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:44,126
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

605
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:54,306
Bomb.

606
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:59,581
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

607
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:00,912
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

608
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,077
Yeah.

609
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:04,417
I didn't say Simon says.

610
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:06,422
It's 9:50,John.

611
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:09,618
The number three train
is arriving now.

612
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:13,129
I left something provocative
on that train,John.

613
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:15,631
Simon says
get to the pay phone

614
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:18,635
next to the news kiosk
in Wall Street station

615
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:19,863
by 10:20,

616
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,804
or the number three train
and its passengers vaporize.

617
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:25,307
Use any means of travel
other than civilian,

618
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:26,468
I blow the train.

619
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:27,977
Attempt to evacuate
the subway,

620
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,307
I blow the train.

621
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:31,974
I call you in 30 minutes.
be there.

622
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:33,414
Fuck.

623
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:37,420
90 blocks in 30 minutes
in New York traffic?

624
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:39,114
It could be double that.

625
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:41,624
We don't even have a car!

626
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:43,785
Hey, hey, sir!
I'm a cop.

627
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:46,455
I'm requisitioning this car
for official police business.

628
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:48,361
Thanks very much. Get in.

629
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:50,866
Pretty slick.
I used to drive a cab.

630
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:53,199
The fastest way south is-aah!

631
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:55,204
What the fuck
are you doing?

632
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:01,377
You were saying?

633
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:04,380
I was saying
I used to drive a cab,

634
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:06,882
and 9th avenue is
the fastest way south.

635
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:08,976
We seem to be going east.

636
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:16,257
Where the hell
are you going?

637
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,726
9th avenue's
the quickest way-

638
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:19,387
I know what I'm doing.

639
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:22,022
Not even God knows
what you're doing!

640
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:24,795
They're headed east
on 72nd towards the park.

641
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:26,131
Wall Street is south!

642
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:28,137
Stop yelling.
I got a headache.

643
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:30,639
The best way south
is not 9th.

644
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:32,300
It's through the park.

645
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,173
Oh, dear.

646
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:37,877
I told you Park Drive's
always jammed.

647
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:39,745
I didn't say Park Drive.

648
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:44,480
I said through the park.

649
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:50,091
Shit! We lost them
in the park headed south.

650
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:53,087
Get out of here!

651
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:54,756
What are you, cr-

652
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:03,073
I got him, Connie.
He's taking the scenic route.

653
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:05,608
Out of the way!

654
00:29:08,546 --> 00:29:10,446
Get out of there!

655
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:17,787
Watch it, watch it,
watch it, watch it.

656
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:19,789
Are you aiming
for these people?

657
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:20,789
No.

658
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:22,018
Maybe that mime.

659
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:24,391
Whoa!

660
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:25,394
Tree! Tree!

661
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:32,363
What's going on here, man?

662
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,208
Tree! Tree!

663
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:42,135
Hang on.

664
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:43,805
Rock! Rock! Rock!

665
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:03,627
McClane!

666
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:11,398
How do Catholics
do their thing?

667
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:12,976
North, South, West, East.

668
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:14,635
How much time?

669
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:15,940
27 minutes.

670
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:18,345
Ha! 72nd and Broadway
to Central Park South

671
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:19,507
in three minutes.

672
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:23,117
It's got to be
a fucking record.

673
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:24,620
Come on, get out-

674
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:27,318
Yeah.

675
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:28,824
Now what?

676
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,733
We need a fire truck.

677
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:37,733
What?

678
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:38,825
To follow.

679
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:43,839
911.

680
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:45,341
<i>LieutenantJohn McClane,
N.Y.P.D..</i>

681
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:46,671
Access number 7479.

682
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:48,177
Calling from a civilian
transmitter.

683
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,509
Get me an emergency
dispatcher right away.

684
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:52,014
Dispatch. Go ahead.

685
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:53,515
I got two officers down

686
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:57,110
at 14th street and 9th avenue!
Need an ambulance! Over!

687
00:30:57,222 --> 00:31:00,191
The Roosevelt Hospital
is two blocks from there.

688
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:29,409
Slow the fuck down,
McClane!

689
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,919
It's like football.

690
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:34,219
Get yourself a blocker
and head for the end zone.

691
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,694
If you'd said
Wall Street,

692
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:41,196
we could have followed
him all the way.

693
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:43,824
Wrong. South of 14th street
is a different hospital.

694
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:45,095
Hang on.

695
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,841
Time?

696
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:57,471
10:02.

697
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,982
We're halfway there,
with 18 minutes to go.

698
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,109
Fuck this!
Hang on.

699
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:16,127
Hang on!

700
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,632
Get out of here!

701
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:19,134
Take the wheel!

702
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:21,603
We should be ahead
of that train, right?

703
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:23,606
I'm getting on
that train.

704
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:26,609
You got to get to
that phone by 10:20.

705
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,611
You fail,
I cover your ass.

706
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:30,613
I fail,
you cover my ass.

707
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:32,114
If we both fail?

708
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:33,615
Then we're both fucked.

709
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:36,312
Go, now! Get to that
phone booth by 10:20!

710
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:38,321
My lucky fucking day.

711
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:43,592
Shit!

712
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:44,957
Look out, ma'am!

713
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:49,326
Look out! Look out!

714
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:51,834
Look out!
Get out of the way!

715
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,002
This is a bad idea.

716
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:20,224
Whoa!

717
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:26,968
Excuse me.

718
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:27,969
Excuse me!

719
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:30,506
Get out of
the way, please.

720
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:45,821
112 Wall Street.

721
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:48,323
This isn't a taxi.
You don't understand.

722
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:50,826
Your light's on.
I'll make it simple.

723
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:54,329
112 Wall Street or I'll have
your medallion suspended.

724
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:57,265
What, you don't like
white people?

725
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,268
112 Wall Street.

726
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,301
You got it.

727
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,784
Move your legs!
Get your legs out of the way!

728
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:16,911
Sorry. Sorry.

729
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,925
Hey! Excuse me.

730
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:42,677
Hey!

731
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:00,658
Shit!

732
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:01,663
Excuse me.

733
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,165
Watch out!

734
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,758
Excuse me, sir.
Pardon me, please. Excuse-

735
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:09,773
Would you step out?

736
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:12,775
I'm a cop.
step out for a minute.

737
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:42,404
Excuse me, please.

738
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:44,407
Can I get
through here, please?

739
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:45,567
Excuse me.

740
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:47,735
Excuse me, please.
Pardon me.

741
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:50,939
Excuse me, but I'm expecting a call.
I need that phone.

742
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:52,709
Use the other phone.

743
00:35:57,855 --> 00:35:59,254
Sir, please.

744
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:01,257
I need to use
that phone.

745
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,759
Hey, listen, bro,
I was here first.

746
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:05,761
Bro?

747
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:08,263
Get away from
the goddamn phone!

748
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:09,765
Put your hands up!

749
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:28,318
I have to answer
that phone.

750
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:30,979
Shut up and
get 'em in the air!

751
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:32,487
Excuse me!
Pardon me!

752
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,285
Watch your back!
Watch it!

753
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:37,122
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm a New York police officer.

754
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:39,719
I'm going to ask you
to calmly and quietly

755
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:43,129
start moving toward
the other end of the car.

756
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:45,960
- Aah!
- Aah!

757
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,662
Go! Watch out!

758
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:49,171
Watch it! Watch it!

759
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:50,467
Go!

760
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,308
I have to answer

761
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:56,744
that phone.

762
00:36:56,847 --> 00:36:58,314
Get 'em up!

763
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:02,475
Look, if you have to shoot me,

764
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:05,647
then you go ahead
and you shoot me!

765
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:08,884
But I have to answer
this phone!

766
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:10,551
All right?

767
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:16,832
I'm here.

768
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:18,333
And McClane?

769
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:19,835
He's on his way.

770
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:22,838
Uh, he's a little slow.
He's out of shape.

771
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,340
The rules applied
to both of you.

772
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:28,503
I'm afraid this is noncompliance.
Goodbye.

773
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:37,853
Trust me, guys...

774
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:41,222
duck.

775
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:20,822
Get out of there!
Get out of there!

776
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:13,315
McClane?

777
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:16,819
Hee hee hee hee.

778
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:18,821
Ha ha ha ha ha.

779
00:39:20,424 --> 00:39:21,823
Wha-

780
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:23,325
Ha ha ha.

781
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:25,952
Ha ha ha ha ha.

782
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:28,463
You can see right down
into the subway.

783
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:30,193
How many fire trucks?

784
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:31,199
You guys.
You guys.

785
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:33,236
How can you see
from up here?

786
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:34,998
Get in there.

787
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:38,337
Officer, tell those people
to get the hell back!

788
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:40,842
We got a shitload
of cuts and bruises,

789
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:42,344
a couple of concussions,

790
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:44,346
some old guy's
pacemaker stopped,

791
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:47,349
and a pregnant girl's water broke,
and that's all.

792
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:48,349
How you doing,John?

793
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:50,352
Still can't hear too good.

794
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:52,354
It's a miracle
you're still alive.

795
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:54,356
Yeah, that's the problem,Joe.

796
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:55,516
What?

797
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:56,923
The miracle part.

798
00:39:57,027 --> 00:40:00,861
What are the odds of us
making it here on time?

799
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:01,863
Zip.

800
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:04,867
That bomb was going off
no matter what.

801
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:08,200
He wanted it to go off
right down here.

802
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:09,897
What's so special
about this place?

803
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:12,407
I don't know.
Something just doesn't add up.

804
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,000
Lieutenant McClane?

805
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:16,238
They're asking for you
and Mr. Carver.

806
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:19,176
Where?

807
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:20,477
John.

808
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:26,389
John, this is Andy Cross
with the FBI.

809
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,390
Mr. Jarvis. He's, uh-

810
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:31,120
I'm, uh,
with another agency.

811
00:40:31,228 --> 00:40:33,128
It's good to meet you.

812
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,891
This is Lieutenant McClane.

813
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:36,626
This is Mr. Carver.

814
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:39,931
Uh, we got a couple of questions.
First...

815
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:41,937
do you recognize this guy?

816
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,468
No.

817
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:49,876
How about this one?

818
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:54,742
Mm-mm.

819
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:56,444
How about you?

820
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,949
Did you recognize
the voice on the phone?

821
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:01,854
No.

822
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,426
Did you, uh,

823
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:07,224
notice any cars
following you?

824
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:09,825
No.

825
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:11,834
Anybody following
you at all?

826
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,096
Any kind
of surveillance-

827
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:15,866
telephone, house,
anything unusual at all?

828
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,701
Well, now that
you mention it,

829
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,368
I have experienced a...

830
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,379
you know,
like a burning sensation

831
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,914
between my toes.

832
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:27,415
I thought it was just some
athlete's foot

833
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:28,746
or something.

834
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,388
We read your jacket,
Lieutenant.

835
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,391
We were told you
would be cooperative.

836
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,892
Cooperate with what?

837
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,393
We're wasting time here.

838
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,963
You want to share
information,

839
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:42,532
how about sending
a little our way?

840
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:44,965
We want to hear
what he knows first.

841
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:47,162
We want to hear
what he knows first.

842
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:50,172
I know as much as you know,
all right?

843
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:53,175
There's a guy out there
setting off bombs.

844
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:54,676
He calls himself Simon.

845
00:41:54,778 --> 00:41:57,110
He speaks with
a German accent.

846
00:41:57,214 --> 00:41:59,944
For some reason,
he's very angry with me.

847
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:02,951
Maybe you can tell me why,
fellas, huh?

848
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:10,654
The first man there
is Mathias Targo.

849
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:12,854
Was Hungarian army,
explosives expert.

850
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:15,363
Now we believe he's working
for the Iranians.

851
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:16,364
Working?

852
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:17,661
Freelance terrorism,

853
00:42:17,768 --> 00:42:19,497
by contract.

854
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:21,366
Who's the girl?

855
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:22,871
Targo's other half.

856
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:25,373
Rumor is the Israelis
slipped a bomb

857
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:26,374
in between their sheets.

858
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:27,501
He wasn't at home,

859
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:29,511
but they think they got her.

860
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:32,013
The second man
was an obscure colonel

861
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:34,016
in the East German army.

862
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:35,380
Ran an infiltration unit,

863
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:38,887
the thing the Nazis did
at the Battle of the Bulge-

864
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:40,217
English-speaking troops.

865
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:41,552
I saw the movie.

866
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:43,820
All we know of him is

867
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:47,830
the GDR medical records show he suffers
from migraines.

868
00:42:47,932 --> 00:42:49,661
His name is Peter...

869
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:50,961
Kreig.

870
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:55,603
Well, that is an exceptional report,
fellas.

871
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:58,539
What does this
have to do with me?

872
00:42:58,642 --> 00:43:02,237
The name Gruber mean anything to you,
Lieutenant?

873
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,550
It rings a bell, yeah.

874
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:09,550
L.A.

875
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:10,642
What?

876
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:13,655
That thing in the building
in L.A.

877
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:16,859
Peter Kreig

878
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:20,294
was born Simon Peter...

879
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:21,364
Gruber.

880
00:43:21,465 --> 00:43:25,697
He's Hans Gruber's brother.

881
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:30,866
So...

882
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:33,375
Yeah. It's that thing in L.A.

883
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:36,878
We figured he's got you fitted up
for a toe tag,

884
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:38,881
and he's going
to do anything

885
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:40,382
to get it tied.

886
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:42,042
Inspector!

887
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:43,119
Inspector, it's him.

888
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:47,082
Don't let him know
we're here.

889
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,219
Simon.

890
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:52,522
Inspector.

891
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:56,031
Now, who from the FBI
is in the van?

892
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,964
Let's see,
almost certainly Cross.

893
00:43:58,068 --> 00:43:59,968
Come on, Andrew,
say hello.

894
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:01,094
Hello.

895
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:03,105
And I know
you never run alone,

896
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:04,606
so say hello, Bill.

897
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:07,609
Still trying to butch up
by chewing on your glasses?

898
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:09,338
Ha ha ha ha.

899
00:44:09,446 --> 00:44:11,846
This, gentlemen, as they say,

900
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:14,975
is where the plot thickens.

901
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:17,485
I have put 2,400 pounds
of explosives

902
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:20,489
in one of the 1,446 schools
in greater New York.

903
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:22,491
It is fitted with a timer

904
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:25,494
set to explode
at exactly 3 p. m.

905
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:27,461
Thank you.

906
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:29,361
Your silence says
I'm understood.

907
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:31,866
Did you say
2,400 pounds?

908
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:33,869
Yes, but please
don't interrupt again.

909
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:37,304
Simon says, if you attempt
to evacuate schools,

910
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:39,808
the bomb will be detonated
by radio.

911
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:41,810
Gentlemen,
someone will be watching.

912
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:44,813
Repeat-one school
will be dismissed at 3 p. m.

913
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:45,813
permanently, unless-

914
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:47,144
Unless what?

915
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:49,378
Unless John McClane
and his new best friend

916
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:51,386
complete the tasks
I set them.

917
00:44:51,488 --> 00:44:53,353
John, are you listening?

918
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:56,550
Yeah.

919
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,491
There's a pay phone
beyond hope,

920
00:44:58,595 --> 00:44:59,493
Tompkins Square Park.

921
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:02,190
20 minutes, go by foot.
No rush.

922
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:03,994
If you're really clever,

923
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:06,797
you'll learn the location of the bomb
and the disarming code.

924
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:08,428
By the way, gentlemen,

925
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:11,838
we got something of a bargain
on radio detonators.

926
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:13,341
The only problem is

927
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:16,345
the darn things respond
to police and FBI frequencies.

928
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:20,144
If I were you,
I'd keep off your radios.

929
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:21,342
Simon, wait-

930
00:45:25,956 --> 00:45:30,359
2,400 pounds of that liquid stuff.
My God!

931
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:32,759
Get me the commissioner.

932
00:45:32,863 --> 00:45:34,763
He's doing
a press conference.

933
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:36,560
He'll be here
in 30 minutes.

934
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:39,568
Get every senior officer
on the site right away.

935
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,365
Don't give me
any jurisdictional nonsense.

936
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:44,566
I got two kids in the school
on 64th street.

937
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:46,199
How can I help?

938
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:48,210
How many men
have you got?

939
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:51,076
75. I push the panic button,
I can get 500.

940
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:52,079
When?

941
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:53,080
2:30, 3:00.

942
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:55,083
Between now and then...

943
00:45:55,185 --> 00:45:58,018
we're going to have to
do this all by ourselves.

944
00:45:58,122 --> 00:46:00,090
Let's go.

945
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:02,590
Tompkins Square Park
is more than 2 miles away.

946
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:05,093
Get running. No radios.
Take my telephone.

947
00:46:05,195 --> 00:46:08,096
You get anything,
call me through the switchboard.

948
00:46:08,198 --> 00:46:09,256
Good luck.

949
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:11,266
Thanks.
Find that bomb.

950
00:46:11,368 --> 00:46:12,835
Ricky, where are they?

951
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:15,063
Right over here.

952
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:17,571
The senior man present
is Chief Allen.

953
00:46:17,674 --> 00:46:19,073
- Chief of what?
- Transit.

954
00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:20,074
Thanks, Ricky.

955
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:22,577
Gentlemen,
we have a decision to make.

956
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:25,079
Chief Allen,
the man who has done this

957
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:28,083
has told us he's planted
a very large bomb

958
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:30,085
in a New York school.

959
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:32,087
He's told us
we cannot evacuate,

960
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:35,056
but he has not said
we cannot search.

961
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:38,060
I recommend we get everybody,
and I mean everybody-

962
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:41,063
police, transit,
sanitation, fire,

963
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:42,564
even the goddamn
librarians-

964
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:44,361
and we start
searching schools,

965
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:46,095
and I mean right now.

966
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:48,603
I'm talking about
a thousand buildings,

967
00:46:48,705 --> 00:46:51,799
and we have 3 hours and 15 minutes
to do it.

968
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:54,810
I'd like to keep the media
out of this

969
00:46:54,912 --> 00:46:57,745
because if they get in,
we've got a panic.

970
00:46:57,848 --> 00:46:59,748
Are we in agreement?

971
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:01,750
Come on, guys, let's go!

972
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:19,334
They bought it.

973
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:22,938
You can begin.

974
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:38,948
Hook...

975
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:40,523
line...

976
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:45,522
and sinker.

977
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,994
You heard the man.
Let's go, let's go.

978
00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:55,903
Come on.

979
00:47:56,006 --> 00:47:57,473
Go. Let's go.

980
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:09,784
O.K. Hold on.

981
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:11,821
Darlene, honey, it's me.

982
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:28,431
Sergeant Turley.

983
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:29,869
Sergeant Turley!

984
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:32,965
In five minutes,
the volume in calls has tripled.

985
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:34,441
What the hell's going on?

986
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:36,512
Stop. Let me explain.

987
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:38,513
For the rest of the day,

988
00:48:38,615 --> 00:48:40,549
we're handling the department's
communications.

989
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:42,448
What do you mean, handle?

990
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:44,417
They're shutting down
the police band.

991
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:46,887
All calls will be coming through
this switchboard.

992
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:49,220
And I'm going to marry
Donald Trump.

993
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:51,351
Walsh, what's going on?

994
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:53,827
Why did everybody
tear out of here?

995
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,364
Pamela, look at your watch.

996
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:57,262
It's coming up
on shift change.

997
00:48:57,367 --> 00:48:59,767
The bean counters
are worried about overtime.

998
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:01,269
Everybody went
to punch out.

999
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:03,737
The next shift
will be here soon.

1000
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:06,138
You are so full of shit, Walsh!

1001
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:08,370
Thank you.

1002
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,912
What the hell?

1003
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,389
Hey. Whoa. Whoa.

1004
00:49:28,498 --> 00:49:29,396
Whoa.

1005
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:30,864
Detective.

1006
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,526
Bob Thompson...

1007
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,127
City Engineer's Office.

1008
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:38,139
We'd like to get an idea
of the damage.

1009
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:43,073
Man, you guys
really got here fast.

1010
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:45,908
Well...

1011
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:47,984
it's Wall Street, sir.

1012
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:50,212
A lot of money here.

1013
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,550
A lot of opinion-makers...

1014
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:56,592
the mayor doesn't want to piss off,
you know?

1015
00:49:56,693 --> 00:49:58,092
Is this it?

1016
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:04,394
Holy Toledo!

1017
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:06,594
Somebody had fun.

1018
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:08,102
I'd appreciate it

1019
00:50:08,205 --> 00:50:11,504
if you'd show my associates
the way down.

1020
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:14,876
Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

1021
00:50:14,978 --> 00:50:17,879
Jimmy, you got the flashlight?

1022
00:50:17,981 --> 00:50:20,245
Murphy, come on. You, too.

1023
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,510
Rick Walsh.

1024
00:50:21,618 --> 00:50:22,642
John Thompson.

1025
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:24,653
Come on, gentlemen.
Let's go.

1026
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:29,624
You were at World Trade's.

1027
00:50:29,726 --> 00:50:31,523
You know what
that mess was.

1028
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:05,793
Please inform Mr. Little

1029
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,921
that Mr. Vanderfluge is here.

1030
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:09,931
Mr. Vanderfluge.

1031
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:14,737
There's a Mr. Vanderfluge
for Mr. Little.

1032
00:51:29,286 --> 00:51:31,686
Go down 20 meters.

1033
00:51:31,788 --> 00:51:32,720
Come on.

1034
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:34,222
A lot of steam.

1035
00:51:34,324 --> 00:51:35,723
We snapped
some steam pipes.

1036
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:37,225
It's like a sauna.

1037
00:51:37,327 --> 00:51:39,887
The subway guys shut
down the third rail.

1038
00:51:39,996 --> 00:51:40,894
Emergency lighting?

1039
00:51:40,997 --> 00:51:42,396
Emergency lights
and there's some-

1040
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:43,397
Hey!

1041
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,058
No shooting!

1042
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:47,136
Speak English!

1043
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:49,603
Otto doesn't speak English.
do you, Otto?

1044
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:51,697
Where did we
get this guy?

1045
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:53,207
One ofTargo's thugs.

1046
00:51:55,345 --> 00:51:56,744
Go all the way up.

1047
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:58,508
All the way.

1048
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:07,222
So what's up with
this L.A. thing?

1049
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:08,723
You famous or something?

1050
00:52:08,825 --> 00:52:10,190
Yeah. For about five minutes.

1051
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:12,022
Don't tell me.
Rodney King, right?

1052
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:13,027
Fuck you.

1053
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,597
You know this guy Simon?

1054
00:52:14,698 --> 00:52:15,722
Yeah.

1055
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:18,699
I threw his little brother
off the 32nd floor

1056
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,702
of Nakatomi Towers
out in L.A.

1057
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,203
I guess he's pissed off.

1058
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:25,138
Wait. I'm in this shit
'cause some white cop

1059
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:27,642
threw some white asshole's
brother off a roof?

1060
00:53:13,256 --> 00:53:14,746
Mr. Vanderfluge.
Felix Little,

1061
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:15,756
Corporate relations.

1062
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,258
Sorry you had to wait,

1063
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,260
but there was
a subway explosion.

1064
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:21,125
It's played hell
with our alarms.

1065
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:22,630
I trust there's
nothing wrong?

1066
00:53:22,732 --> 00:53:24,131
No. Good Lord, no.

1067
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:25,633
Safe and secure.

1068
00:53:25,735 --> 00:53:28,363
You were concerned
about a currency exchange.

1069
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:31,872
We are not a commercial bank
in the normal sense.

1070
00:53:31,975 --> 00:53:34,808
We're... we're
primarily, uh...

1071
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:35,809
governments, central banks,

1072
00:53:35,912 --> 00:53:37,277
that sort of thing.

1073
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,541
Apart from the depository,
of course.

1074
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:40,809
Of course.

1075
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:43,818
And you are in the flower business,
Mr. Vanderfluge?

1076
00:53:47,657 --> 00:53:48,715
Back! Back!

1077
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:49,723
Come on!

1078
00:54:14,451 --> 00:54:15,509
Come on.

1079
00:54:29,799 --> 00:54:31,198
Oh, no,
Mr. Vanderfluge.

1080
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:33,792
That's the vault
elevator.

1081
00:54:33,903 --> 00:54:35,097
I'm sorry.

1082
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:37,537
Our alarms are
sonic and seismic.

1083
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:40,804
Two things which do not react well
to explosions.

1084
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:44,346
This subway business has knocked out
all of our systems.

1085
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:47,382
In fact, we gave up
and pulled the plug.

1086
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:49,349
The repair people
are downstairs now.

1087
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:50,350
Good Lord.

1088
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:51,477
Yeah.

1089
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:54,989
Heavens to Betsy!
If anyone knew. Ha ha ha.

1090
00:54:57,327 --> 00:55:01,491
But... I thought this
was a currency exchange.

1091
00:55:01,598 --> 00:55:04,965
Oh, I think we go straight
to the withdrawal.

1092
00:55:53,149 --> 00:55:54,047
Hey, Captain,

1093
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:55,845
come and take
a look at this.

1094
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:57,283
Something's going on.

1095
00:55:58,388 --> 00:56:00,322
You think you
can fix that?

1096
00:56:00,423 --> 00:56:01,390
Just a minute now.

1097
00:56:06,062 --> 00:56:07,324
O.K.
I'll be right back.

1098
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:08,328
Down!

1099
00:56:13,295 --> 00:56:15,456
Stay back!

1100
00:56:15,564 --> 00:56:16,690
Stay back!

1101
00:56:50,332 --> 00:56:53,062
Come on. Come on!

1102
00:57:03,145 --> 00:57:04,077
Front desk.

1103
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:07,411
Get your ass down here!
I'm under attack!

1104
00:57:07,516 --> 00:57:10,679
Just relax.
Maybe you'll live through this.

1105
00:57:10,853 --> 00:57:12,286
Shit!

1106
00:57:16,125 --> 00:57:17,023
Aah!

1107
00:57:17,126 --> 00:57:18,150
Aah!

1108
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:19,158
Aah!

1109
00:57:19,261 --> 00:57:20,159
Aah!

1110
00:57:20,262 --> 00:57:21,160
Aah!

1111
00:57:21,263 --> 00:57:22,753
Aah!

1112
00:57:22,865 --> 00:57:23,763
Aah!

1113
00:57:24,867 --> 00:57:26,095
Aah!

1114
00:57:26,202 --> 00:57:27,726
Aah!

1115
00:57:33,709 --> 00:57:36,872
I think he's dead,
my dear.

1116
00:57:39,815 --> 00:57:42,181
All right.
Let's see to the office workers.

1117
00:57:42,284 --> 00:57:44,479
Being done,
Herr Oberst.

1118
00:57:47,323 --> 00:57:48,722
Is this where...

1119
00:57:48,824 --> 00:57:51,850
Perimeter secure,
Herr Oberst.

1120
00:58:26,629 --> 00:58:30,190
$140 billion!

1121
00:58:30,299 --> 00:58:33,200
10 times
what's in Kentucky!

1122
00:58:33,302 --> 00:58:35,702
Fort Knox. Hah!

1123
00:58:35,804 --> 00:58:37,271
It's for tourists!

1124
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:51,717
Yeah?

1125
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:52,718
McClane.

1126
00:58:52,821 --> 00:58:54,721
John,
you're out of shape.

1127
00:58:54,823 --> 00:58:56,222
You barely made it.

1128
00:58:56,325 --> 00:58:57,724
We'll barely make it.

1129
00:58:57,826 --> 00:59:00,226
What do you want us
to do?

1130
00:59:00,329 --> 00:59:01,626
What has four legs

1131
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:03,755
and is always ready
to travel?

1132
00:59:03,866 --> 00:59:04,764
Huh?

1133
00:59:05,868 --> 00:59:07,267
What did he say?

1134
00:59:07,369 --> 00:59:10,270
What has four legs
and is always ready to travel?

1135
00:59:10,372 --> 00:59:11,669
Don't you have kids?

1136
00:59:11,774 --> 00:59:13,207
That's an elephant joke.

1137
00:59:18,647 --> 00:59:20,171
Whoa.

1138
00:59:20,282 --> 00:59:21,681
That a bomb?

1139
00:59:21,784 --> 00:59:23,684
Yeah. Go ahead and grab it.

1140
00:59:23,786 --> 00:59:25,185
No. You're the cop.

1141
00:59:25,287 --> 00:59:27,687
You're supposed to be
helping with this.

1142
00:59:27,790 --> 00:59:28,688
I'm helping.

1143
00:59:28,791 --> 00:59:30,190
When you going
to start helping?

1144
00:59:30,292 --> 00:59:32,419
After you get the bomb.

1145
00:59:49,812 --> 00:59:50,710
Careful.

1146
00:59:50,813 --> 00:59:52,007
I'm being careful.

1147
00:59:52,114 --> 00:59:53,274
Don't open it.

1148
00:59:53,382 --> 00:59:54,280
What?

1149
00:59:54,383 --> 00:59:56,283
I got to open it.

1150
00:59:56,385 --> 00:59:59,513
It's going to be
all right.

1151
01:00:09,832 --> 01:00:10,662
Shit!

1152
01:00:10,833 --> 01:00:11,663
Shit!

1153
01:00:11,767 --> 01:00:13,962
I told you
not to open it!

1154
01:00:18,307 --> 01:00:20,707
I trust you see
the message.

1155
01:00:20,809 --> 01:00:22,709
It has a proximity circuit,

1156
01:00:22,811 --> 01:00:24,210
so please don't run.

1157
01:00:24,313 --> 01:00:25,712
We're not going to run.

1158
01:00:25,814 --> 01:00:27,714
How do we turn
this off?

1159
01:00:27,816 --> 01:00:29,784
On the fountain
are two jugs.

1160
01:00:29,885 --> 01:00:32,854
Do you see them?
A 5 gallon and a 3 gallon.

1161
01:00:32,955 --> 01:00:37,358
Fill one jug with exactly
4 gallons of water.

1162
01:00:37,459 --> 01:00:41,156
Place it on the scale,
and the timer will stop.

1163
01:00:41,263 --> 01:00:42,491
You must be precise.

1164
01:00:42,598 --> 01:00:44,498
1 ounce or more or less

1165
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,124
will result in detonation.

1166
01:00:46,235 --> 01:00:48,863
- If you're still alive in
five minutes- - Wait a second!

1167
01:00:52,307 --> 01:00:54,707
I don't get it.
Do you get it?

1168
01:00:54,810 --> 01:00:55,708
No.

1169
01:00:57,312 --> 01:00:59,246
Get the jugs.

1170
01:01:00,816 --> 01:01:05,344
Obviously, we can't fill the 3-gallon
jug with 4 gallons, right?

1171
01:01:05,454 --> 01:01:07,354
I know. Here we go.

1172
01:01:07,456 --> 01:01:10,220
We fill the 3-gallon jug
exactly to the top, right?

1173
01:01:10,325 --> 01:01:11,223
Uh-huh.

1174
01:01:11,326 --> 01:01:13,760
We pour that 3 gallons
into the 5-gallon jug,

1175
01:01:13,862 --> 01:01:16,660
giving us 3 gallons
in a 5-gallon jug.

1176
01:01:16,765 --> 01:01:17,732
Then what?

1177
01:01:17,833 --> 01:01:20,734
We take the 3-gallon jug,
fill it a third-

1178
01:01:20,836 --> 01:01:23,031
He said be precise.
Exactly 4 gallons.

1179
01:01:23,138 --> 01:01:24,332
Every cop's running
his ass off,

1180
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:27,341
and I'm out here playing kid's games
in the park.

1181
01:01:27,443 --> 01:01:31,675
Hey! You want to focus
on the problem at hand?

1182
01:01:47,896 --> 01:01:50,797
You said, don't say anything
if you don't know!

1183
01:01:50,899 --> 01:01:53,197
Give me the fucking jug!
We're starting over!

1184
01:01:53,302 --> 01:01:54,701
We can't start over!

1185
01:01:54,803 --> 01:01:56,998
I'll put my foot
up your ass,

1186
01:01:57,106 --> 01:01:58,300
you dumb mother-

1187
01:01:58,407 --> 01:01:59,601
Say it! Say it!

1188
01:01:59,708 --> 01:02:02,609
You were going to call me a nigger,
weren't you?

1189
01:02:02,711 --> 01:02:04,611
I wasn't!
Yes, you were!

1190
01:02:04,713 --> 01:02:05,941
Asshole! How's that? Asshole!

1191
01:02:06,048 --> 01:02:08,380
You got some fucking problem
because I'm white?

1192
01:02:08,484 --> 01:02:09,712
Have I oppressed you?

1193
01:02:09,818 --> 01:02:12,150
Have I oppressed
your people somehow?

1194
01:02:12,254 --> 01:02:15,155
You don't like me
'cause you're a racist!

1195
01:02:15,257 --> 01:02:16,383
What?

1196
01:02:16,492 --> 01:02:18,722
You don't like me
'cause I'm white!

1197
01:02:18,827 --> 01:02:21,728
I don't like you because you're going
to get me killed!

1198
01:02:21,830 --> 01:02:24,731
Shit! We got
less than a minute.

1199
01:02:24,833 --> 01:02:26,232
Throw this thing away.

1200
01:02:26,335 --> 01:02:27,962
We can't!
It'll detonate!

1201
01:02:28,070 --> 01:02:30,664
Wait a second!
Wait a second!

1202
01:02:30,772 --> 01:02:33,673
I got it!
Exactly 2 gallons in here, right?

1203
01:02:33,775 --> 01:02:35,675
Leaving 1 gallon
of empty space.

1204
01:02:35,777 --> 01:02:36,766
Yeah.

1205
01:02:36,879 --> 01:02:38,779
A full 5 gallons here,
right?

1206
01:02:38,881 --> 01:02:42,180
pour 1 gallon out of 5 gallons
into there, we have exactly...

1207
01:02:42,284 --> 01:02:44,081
4 gallons!
4 gallons!

1208
01:02:44,186 --> 01:02:45,084
Come on!

1209
01:02:46,288 --> 01:02:48,688
Don't spill-
Don't spill it.

1210
01:02:48,790 --> 01:02:49,688
Good. Good.

1211
01:02:49,791 --> 01:02:51,349
We got 4 gallons.

1212
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:52,859
You did it, McClane!

1213
01:02:52,961 --> 01:02:55,862
Put it on the thing!
Get it down there!

1214
01:02:55,964 --> 01:02:58,694
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1215
01:03:02,638 --> 01:03:05,471
Congratulations.
You're still alive.

1216
01:03:05,574 --> 01:03:06,472
Huh?

1217
01:03:06,575 --> 01:03:07,473
Congratulations.

1218
01:03:07,576 --> 01:03:09,271
Yeah, we did it.

1219
01:03:09,378 --> 01:03:11,209
You surprise me again,
John.

1220
01:03:11,313 --> 01:03:13,838
This is becoming
an ugly habit.

1221
01:03:13,949 --> 01:03:16,850
I don't have the time right now,
Simon.

1222
01:03:16,952 --> 01:03:18,351
A deal's a deal.

1223
01:03:18,453 --> 01:03:19,511
Where's the school bomb?

1224
01:03:19,621 --> 01:03:22,522
On the contrary,
you have lots of time.

1225
01:03:22,624 --> 01:03:24,649
You have...

1226
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:28,161
2 hours and 47 minutes
precisely.

1227
01:03:28,263 --> 01:03:31,824
Plenty of time to test
those wits of yours.

1228
01:03:31,934 --> 01:03:33,333
Listen,jerk-off,

1229
01:03:33,435 --> 01:03:35,835
I got a bad
fucking hangover!

1230
01:03:35,938 --> 01:03:38,168
Now, where is
the school bomb?

1231
01:03:38,273 --> 01:03:40,264
Temper,John.

1232
01:03:40,375 --> 01:03:43,276
The road to truth
has many turns.

1233
01:03:43,378 --> 01:03:47,280
You'll find an envelope
under the rim of the fountain.

1234
01:03:47,382 --> 01:03:49,782
When you undertake
the trip it suggests,

1235
01:03:49,885 --> 01:03:51,284
ask yourself
this question-

1236
01:03:51,386 --> 01:03:55,049
What is 21 out of 42?

1237
01:03:56,959 --> 01:03:58,119
We're behind.

1238
01:03:58,227 --> 01:04:00,422
We should abandon
the rest and go.

1239
01:04:00,529 --> 01:04:02,997
Relax, Targo.
There's not a cop for 20 blocks.

1240
01:04:03,098 --> 01:04:07,501
He's sending us to the home team dugout
at Yankee Stadium.

1241
01:04:07,603 --> 01:04:10,003
We supposed to find
something there?

1242
01:04:10,105 --> 01:04:11,936
What's 21 out of 42?

1243
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:13,940
21 again.
Half of 42.

1244
01:04:14,042 --> 01:04:14,974
42 what?

1245
01:04:15,077 --> 01:04:17,944
How many players
on the Yankees ball club?

1246
01:04:18,046 --> 01:04:18,944
25.

1247
01:04:19,047 --> 01:04:20,446
What else is 21?

1248
01:04:20,549 --> 01:04:21,447
Blackjack.

1249
01:04:21,550 --> 01:04:22,448
It's a club.

1250
01:04:22,551 --> 01:04:25,452
It's a wild goose chase
is what it is.

1251
01:04:28,757 --> 01:04:31,157
Where's the nearest
"A" train?

1252
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:32,659
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1253
01:04:32,761 --> 01:04:36,595
You know,
some kid might find that.

1254
01:04:36,698 --> 01:04:38,188
You're right.

1255
01:04:43,272 --> 01:04:44,466
Come back here,

1256
01:04:44,606 --> 01:04:46,665
you little sons of bitches!

1257
01:04:46,775 --> 01:04:48,675
Hey, you!
I remember you!

1258
01:04:48,777 --> 01:04:50,677
Ha ha.

1259
01:04:50,779 --> 01:04:52,644
Hey, where you going?

1260
01:04:52,748 --> 01:04:53,976
What are you doing?

1261
01:04:54,082 --> 01:04:55,276
Let me go, dickhead!

1262
01:04:55,384 --> 01:04:56,783
Watch your mouth.

1263
01:04:56,885 --> 01:04:59,786
You going to juvenile hall
for a Butterfinger?

1264
01:04:59,888 --> 01:05:02,686
Look around.
All the cops are into something.

1265
01:05:02,791 --> 01:05:05,692
It's Christmas!
You could steal City Hall!

1266
01:05:13,168 --> 01:05:14,066
Come on.

1267
01:05:14,169 --> 01:05:15,568
My bike.

1268
01:05:15,671 --> 01:05:17,070
That's my bike!

1269
01:05:17,172 --> 01:05:19,140
Hey! Hey!
Where you going?

1270
01:05:19,241 --> 01:05:20,640
Yankee Stadium's that way!

1271
01:05:20,742 --> 01:05:21,674
You asshole!

1272
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:32,084
Why don't you run over
everybody in the street?

1273
01:05:32,187 --> 01:05:34,587
What the fuck
are we doing?

1274
01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:37,591
What is it that Wall Street
doesn't have?

1275
01:05:37,693 --> 01:05:38,921
You're talking in riddles.

1276
01:05:39,027 --> 01:05:41,518
What is it that Wall Street
does not have?

1277
01:05:41,630 --> 01:05:42,528
What? Schools.

1278
01:05:42,631 --> 01:05:44,360
And what do they have
a shitload of?

1279
01:05:44,466 --> 01:05:45,694
What?

1280
01:05:53,542 --> 01:05:55,703
I'll be back in a minute.

1281
01:05:55,811 --> 01:05:58,678
What am I supposed to do
with this?

1282
01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:01,271
Give it to those guys
over there.

1283
01:06:01,383 --> 01:06:02,611
He's here.

1284
01:06:02,718 --> 01:06:04,709
Perhaps you could be
more specific.

1285
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:06,219
McClane is here.

1286
01:06:06,321 --> 01:06:08,687
He's walking toward
the bank.

1287
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:12,726
The black man
is coming toward me.

1288
01:06:12,828 --> 01:06:17,731
And after we've gone
to all that trouble at the stadium.

1289
01:06:17,833 --> 01:06:19,198
Simon...

1290
01:06:19,301 --> 01:06:20,529
kill him.

1291
01:06:20,635 --> 01:06:23,695
Stop toying with him
and kill him now.

1292
01:06:23,805 --> 01:06:26,569
O.K. So be it.

1293
01:06:26,675 --> 01:06:28,575
May he rest in peace.

1294
01:06:28,677 --> 01:06:31,077
I'll inform Karl
in the lobby.

1295
01:06:31,179 --> 01:06:33,704
Pack up your team
and get out.

1296
01:06:33,815 --> 01:06:34,747
And this one?

1297
01:06:34,850 --> 01:06:36,317
Officer...

1298
01:06:39,321 --> 01:06:42,586
I'm going to need an answer
on that issue.

1299
01:06:47,829 --> 01:06:49,262
Let him go.

1300
01:06:49,364 --> 01:06:50,262
Understood.

1301
01:06:50,365 --> 01:06:51,662
Yes, sir?

1302
01:06:51,767 --> 01:06:54,736
John McClane says
to give you this.

1303
01:06:54,836 --> 01:06:56,235
Jesus, don't open it.

1304
01:06:56,338 --> 01:06:57,737
It's a bomb.

1305
01:06:57,839 --> 01:06:58,737
Another?

1306
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:00,239
Yeah.

1307
01:07:00,342 --> 01:07:01,741
Oh, I see.

1308
01:07:01,843 --> 01:07:03,743
We'd better move now.

1309
01:07:03,845 --> 01:07:05,745
Thank you for your assistance.

1310
01:07:05,847 --> 01:07:07,246
We really appreciate it.

1311
01:07:07,349 --> 01:07:08,338
Thank you.

1312
01:07:27,869 --> 01:07:31,703
Hey, y'all leaving
this place unguarded?

1313
01:07:52,327 --> 01:07:53,726
How you doing?

1314
01:07:53,829 --> 01:07:55,592
All right.

1315
01:07:55,697 --> 01:07:56,595
John McClane...

1316
01:07:56,698 --> 01:07:58,325
<i>N.Y.P.D..</i>

1317
01:07:58,433 --> 01:08:00,424
Are you all right?

1318
01:08:00,535 --> 01:08:01,729
Yes...

1319
01:08:01,837 --> 01:08:03,134
laundry day.

1320
01:08:03,238 --> 01:08:06,139
What can I do for you,
Lieutenant?

1321
01:08:06,241 --> 01:08:08,641
It's been quiet
all morning here?

1322
01:08:08,743 --> 01:08:09,641
Well-

1323
01:08:09,744 --> 01:08:11,177
Except for
that big explosion

1324
01:08:11,279 --> 01:08:12,678
a couple of hours ago.

1325
01:08:12,781 --> 01:08:15,147
Seen anything strange
happen in the last hour?

1326
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:18,151
No. We've had cops
in here pretty steady

1327
01:08:18,253 --> 01:08:19,652
since the subway thing.

1328
01:08:19,754 --> 01:08:22,689
We were going to make a round
on the vault floor

1329
01:08:22,791 --> 01:08:24,691
if you want
to tag along.

1330
01:08:24,793 --> 01:08:26,693
Sure. Think I will.

1331
01:08:26,795 --> 01:08:29,195
What do you think
of this heat?

1332
01:08:29,297 --> 01:08:30,696
Indian summer, huh?

1333
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:33,700
Feels like it's going to rain
like dogs and cats later.

1334
01:08:33,802 --> 01:08:35,702
Here's one of your guys.

1335
01:08:35,804 --> 01:08:38,204
Detective, uh, Otto, isn't it?

1336
01:08:38,306 --> 01:08:39,967
John McClane.

1337
01:08:43,512 --> 01:08:45,173
Mike, how you doing?

1338
01:08:47,148 --> 01:08:48,376
I keep telling myself

1339
01:08:48,483 --> 01:08:50,383
I'm going to
take the stairs

1340
01:08:50,485 --> 01:08:51,383
just for the exercise...

1341
01:08:51,486 --> 01:08:53,716
but on a hot day like this,

1342
01:08:53,822 --> 01:08:56,723
it seems I always end up
riding the lift.

1343
01:09:23,652 --> 01:09:26,553
What was the lottery number
last night?

1344
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:28,054
You play the lottery?

1345
01:09:28,156 --> 01:09:29,054
No?

1346
01:09:29,157 --> 01:09:32,058
My wife buys me two tickets
every week.

1347
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:34,355
Plays the same two numbers
all the time.

1348
01:09:34,462 --> 01:09:37,363
I say, "Why don't you play
a different number?"

1349
01:09:37,465 --> 01:09:39,695
She goes,
"Those are my lucky numbers. "

1350
01:09:39,801 --> 01:09:41,792
I got the tickets
right here-

1351
01:09:44,472 --> 01:09:46,372
Put that fucking gun down!

1352
01:09:46,474 --> 01:09:48,066
Put it down now!

1353
01:09:53,949 --> 01:09:55,177
Put it down!

1354
01:10:01,222 --> 01:10:03,349
Hello!

1355
01:10:03,458 --> 01:10:05,483
Anybody down here?

1356
01:10:15,770 --> 01:10:17,931
Freeze! Put your fucking hands
in the air!

1357
01:10:18,039 --> 01:10:19,438
No,John! No! No!

1358
01:10:19,541 --> 01:10:20,530
It's me!

1359
01:10:22,277 --> 01:10:24,677
You almost gave me
a heart attack.

1360
01:10:24,779 --> 01:10:25,973
You all right?

1361
01:10:26,081 --> 01:10:26,979
Huh?

1362
01:10:27,082 --> 01:10:28,276
You all right!

1363
01:10:28,383 --> 01:10:29,680
Yeah. It's not my blood.

1364
01:10:29,784 --> 01:10:30,978
What's going on
down here?

1365
01:10:31,086 --> 01:10:32,280
Go take a look.

1366
01:10:54,976 --> 01:10:56,238
Hey, McClane.

1367
01:10:56,344 --> 01:10:57,902
Where the hell
is everybody?

1368
01:10:58,013 --> 01:11:00,709
Simon fuckin' says!

1369
01:11:00,815 --> 01:11:03,215
I should've seen it coming
a mile away.

1370
01:11:03,318 --> 01:11:04,876
This was never
about revenge.

1371
01:11:04,986 --> 01:11:06,544
It's about a goddamn heist.

1372
01:11:06,655 --> 01:11:08,213
What was in the room?

1373
01:11:08,323 --> 01:11:09,881
This.

1374
01:11:09,991 --> 01:11:11,982
What is this?

1375
01:11:12,093 --> 01:11:13,651
Oh, shit!
Is this gold?

1376
01:11:13,762 --> 01:11:15,161
Yeah, it's gold.

1377
01:11:15,263 --> 01:11:16,491
Damn, this is heavy!

1378
01:11:16,598 --> 01:11:18,998
They cleaned out
a whole room of this?

1379
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:19,998
Yeah.

1380
01:11:20,101 --> 01:11:22,001
That would take
a tank or...

1381
01:11:22,103 --> 01:11:23,297
A dump truck.

1382
01:11:24,439 --> 01:11:25,997
14 great big
dump trucks.

1383
01:11:26,107 --> 01:11:28,769
We almost got hit
by a dump truck.

1384
01:11:28,877 --> 01:11:30,276
Damn! Slow down! Shit!

1385
01:11:30,378 --> 01:11:31,777
Put that shit down.

1386
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:33,108
No fuckin' way.

1387
01:11:33,214 --> 01:11:35,614
They ain't going to
let you keep it.

1388
01:11:35,717 --> 01:11:37,184
We'll need a car.

1389
01:11:43,458 --> 01:11:44,686
Can you hot-wire this?

1390
01:11:44,793 --> 01:11:47,193
Of course I can.
I'm an electrician.

1391
01:11:47,295 --> 01:11:49,388
Only problem is...

1392
01:11:52,467 --> 01:11:54,833
Takes too fuckin' long.

1393
01:12:06,781 --> 01:12:08,180
Not on the bridge!

1394
01:12:08,283 --> 01:12:10,945
Down there, McClane!
the FDR!

1395
01:12:14,155 --> 01:12:17,318
Let's go! Let's go!
Come on!

1396
01:12:17,425 --> 01:12:18,585
Oh, shit!

1397
01:12:18,693 --> 01:12:19,660
What?

1398
01:12:19,761 --> 01:12:20,989
Shot the phone.

1399
01:12:21,096 --> 01:12:24,224
Aw, too bad.
What's 21 out of 42?

1400
01:12:24,332 --> 01:12:25,890
I don't have a clue.

1401
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,160
What about Yankee Stadium?

1402
01:12:27,268 --> 01:12:29,259
We'll get there,
after we stop him.

1403
01:12:29,370 --> 01:12:31,270
Oh,Jesus Christ!

1404
01:12:31,372 --> 01:12:33,897
Who do you think you are, lady,
Hillary Clinton?

1405
01:12:34,008 --> 01:12:36,568
That's it! Hillary Clinton.
the 42nd president.

1406
01:12:36,678 --> 01:12:38,236
She'd be the 43rd president.

1407
01:12:38,346 --> 01:12:40,746
All right, all right,
but who's the 21 st?

1408
01:12:40,849 --> 01:12:42,749
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

1409
01:12:42,851 --> 01:12:44,079
No! Do you know?

1410
01:12:44,185 --> 01:12:45,083
No!

1411
01:12:45,186 --> 01:12:46,448
Well?

1412
01:12:46,554 --> 01:12:48,112
This engine's shit.
Step on it!

1413
01:12:48,223 --> 01:12:50,953
It's a Yugo.
It's built for economy, not speed.

1414
01:12:53,895 --> 01:12:55,453
Whoa! What are you doing?

1415
01:12:55,563 --> 01:12:56,962
Getting us
another phone.

1416
01:12:59,801 --> 01:13:00,768
Wait, Wait!

1417
01:13:00,869 --> 01:13:02,598
Wait, wait, wait!

1418
01:13:02,704 --> 01:13:04,262
Who was the 21 st president?

1419
01:13:04,372 --> 01:13:05,805
Go fuck yourself!

1420
01:13:08,209 --> 01:13:09,437
That guy was pissed.

1421
01:13:09,544 --> 01:13:12,035
He'll feel better when he looks
in the backseat.

1422
01:13:12,147 --> 01:13:14,047
Shit, that was
my gold bar!

1423
01:13:14,149 --> 01:13:16,879
This is McClane.
Get me Inspector Walter Cobb.

1424
01:13:16,985 --> 01:13:18,543
Where the hell are you?

1425
01:13:18,653 --> 01:13:20,553
It's not revenge.
It's a heist.

1426
01:13:20,655 --> 01:13:22,555
There's gold
in the Federal Reserve.

1427
01:13:22,657 --> 01:13:24,648
They took a shitload of it.

1428
01:13:24,759 --> 01:13:26,124
They're headed north
in dump trucks.

1429
01:13:26,227 --> 01:13:27,251
Have you been drinking?

1430
01:13:27,362 --> 01:13:28,829
Not since this morning.

1431
01:13:28,930 --> 01:13:31,296
There's a lot of
dump trucks northbound

1432
01:13:31,399 --> 01:13:33,128
on the FDR
at about 7 Oth.

1433
01:13:33,234 --> 01:13:35,464
Close the bridge.
Get some helicopters over there.

1434
01:13:35,570 --> 01:13:37,470
I couldn't close
a hot dog stand now.

1435
01:13:37,572 --> 01:13:38,470
I'm spread all over.

1436
01:13:38,573 --> 01:13:40,165
What about this damn bomb?

1437
01:13:40,275 --> 01:13:43,472
It's got something to do
with the 21 st president.

1438
01:13:43,578 --> 01:13:45,409
John,John, the 21 st what?

1439
01:13:45,513 --> 01:13:46,411
Walter!

1440
01:13:46,514 --> 01:13:49,483
Shit. Goddamn cellular fuckin' phones!

1441
01:13:49,584 --> 01:13:51,142
Reach Munsen
On the Triborough.

1442
01:13:51,252 --> 01:13:53,652
Tell him to close
all the East River bridges

1443
01:13:53,755 --> 01:13:54,687
north of 59th street.

1444
01:13:54,789 --> 01:13:56,017
Looking for dump trucks.

1445
01:13:56,124 --> 01:13:57,022
Dump trucks?

1446
01:13:57,125 --> 01:13:59,025
McClane says
there are dump trucks

1447
01:13:59,127 --> 01:14:01,994
headed up the FDR
loaded with gold.

1448
01:14:02,096 --> 01:14:04,929
They don't allow dump trucks
on the FDR!

1449
01:14:05,033 --> 01:14:06,432
- Connie!
- All right!

1450
01:14:06,534 --> 01:14:08,968
I won't argue,
no matter how stupid it is.

1451
01:14:09,070 --> 01:14:11,903
K-9. Check out
the boiler room.

1452
01:14:12,006 --> 01:14:13,405
Find anything, Charlie?

1453
01:14:13,508 --> 01:14:15,908
I could spend a week here
with an X-ray machine

1454
01:14:16,010 --> 01:14:17,910
and still not find it.

1455
01:14:18,012 --> 01:14:21,311
You've got five minutes.
Then we're moving up to 86th street.

1456
01:14:21,416 --> 01:14:23,316
Going as fast as we can.

1457
01:14:23,418 --> 01:14:24,476
What's up?

1458
01:14:24,586 --> 01:14:26,144
McClane was mentioning something

1459
01:14:26,254 --> 01:14:28,484
about the Federal Reserve building.

1460
01:14:28,590 --> 01:14:31,150
Isn't that near that
Wall Street bomb site?

1461
01:14:31,259 --> 01:14:32,157
Yeah.

1462
01:14:38,433 --> 01:14:40,697
How long do you want us
to stay here?

1463
01:14:40,802 --> 01:14:43,362
The men at the stadium.
Stay or go?

1464
01:14:43,471 --> 01:14:45,871
Karl should've
checked in by now.

1465
01:14:45,974 --> 01:14:46,872
Moment.

1466
01:14:54,515 --> 01:14:55,914
Come on, come on.

1467
01:14:58,453 --> 01:15:00,819
Stay where you are.
McClane may still turn up.

1468
01:15:01,923 --> 01:15:04,551
Relax, Targo.
If he is still alive...

1469
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:08,686
he won't be talking
to anyone.

1470
01:15:08,796 --> 01:15:10,661
It's the next turnoff.

1471
01:15:10,765 --> 01:15:13,598
Hi. It's Elvis Duran.
You're on the air. What's up?

1472
01:15:13,701 --> 01:15:17,102
First I want to tell you what
a great show you got.

1473
01:15:17,205 --> 01:15:19,605
I listen to you
all the time.

1474
01:15:19,707 --> 01:15:21,265
Thanks. What's on your mind?

1475
01:15:21,376 --> 01:15:23,276
Those cop cars speeding
around everywhere-

1476
01:15:23,378 --> 01:15:24,743
you know what
they're up to?

1477
01:15:24,846 --> 01:15:27,212
There's a bomb
in a school.

1478
01:15:27,315 --> 01:15:28,714
My cousin's a cop.

1479
01:15:28,816 --> 01:15:32,115
Somebody put a big bomb
in a school somewhere.

1480
01:15:32,220 --> 01:15:34,120
Only they don't know
which one.

1481
01:15:34,222 --> 01:15:36,122
so they're searching
all of them.

1482
01:15:36,224 --> 01:15:37,623
Shh! Shh!

1483
01:15:37,725 --> 01:15:40,125
Every school
in the metropolitan area.

1484
01:15:40,228 --> 01:15:42,253
Holy shit.

1485
01:15:42,363 --> 01:15:43,261
Doris. Annie?

1486
01:15:43,364 --> 01:15:45,389
Doris, can you reach my wife?

1487
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:48,492
Turley! Half the goddamn city

1488
01:15:48,603 --> 01:15:50,503
just called 911!

1489
01:15:53,107 --> 01:15:54,005
They're gone.

1490
01:15:54,108 --> 01:15:55,006
What?

1491
01:15:55,109 --> 01:15:56,201
They're gone!

1492
01:15:56,311 --> 01:15:57,869
Who is this guy,
Houdini?

1493
01:15:57,979 --> 01:15:59,606
Down there!
Down there!

1494
01:16:00,782 --> 01:16:02,374
This thing got air bags?

1495
01:16:02,483 --> 01:16:05,077
Your side does.
I don't know about mi-

1496
01:16:06,187 --> 01:16:08,178
McClane!

1497
01:16:27,809 --> 01:16:30,710
In the truck!
Let me see the hands!

1498
01:16:30,812 --> 01:16:32,541
Put them on the door!

1499
01:16:37,218 --> 01:16:38,480
Don't kill me!

1500
01:16:38,586 --> 01:16:39,985
Don't shoot me.

1501
01:16:41,155 --> 01:16:42,315
Truck driver?

1502
01:16:42,423 --> 01:16:45,688
No, I'm a beautician.
Of course I'm a truck driver!

1503
01:16:45,793 --> 01:16:47,761
Where you taking
this truck?

1504
01:16:47,862 --> 01:16:49,591
The aqueduct.

1505
01:16:49,697 --> 01:16:52,427
Why you taking this
to the race track?

1506
01:16:52,533 --> 01:16:55,866
No, the aqueduct!
The-the water aqueduct!

1507
01:16:55,970 --> 01:16:56,937
Aqueduct?

1508
01:16:59,173 --> 01:17:01,073
See? Goes from here

1509
01:17:01,175 --> 01:17:03,837
all the way up
to the Catskill Mountains!

1510
01:17:03,945 --> 01:17:04,934
What does?

1511
01:17:05,046 --> 01:17:08,341
That! The water pipe!
Goes for about 60 miles!

1512
01:17:15,323 --> 01:17:16,915
- Hey, you the foreman?
- Yeah.

1513
01:17:17,025 --> 01:17:18,925
N.Y.P.D.!
Any extra dump trucks

1514
01:17:19,027 --> 01:17:21,427
come through here
the last couple minutes?

1515
01:17:21,529 --> 01:17:23,656
I'm writing
those fuckin' clowns up!

1516
01:17:23,765 --> 01:17:26,029
They better start paying attention
to work orders.

1517
01:17:26,134 --> 01:17:27,226
What happened?

1518
01:17:27,335 --> 01:17:29,735
A dozen idiots
tore ass up the tube.

1519
01:17:29,837 --> 01:17:32,738
We're not loading up there anymore.
We're loading over here.

1520
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:34,740
So much for bridges
and helicopters.

1521
01:17:34,842 --> 01:17:37,242
Got a map showing
where this tunnel goes?

1522
01:17:37,345 --> 01:17:38,744
Yeah, right here.

1523
01:17:39,847 --> 01:17:41,906
We run pretty much
up under the saw mill

1524
01:17:42,016 --> 01:17:44,416
till you get up
to the coffer dam.

1525
01:17:44,519 --> 01:17:47,352
After that, we've already brought
the reservoir water down.

1526
01:17:47,455 --> 01:17:49,719
Any way in or out
of there?

1527
01:17:49,824 --> 01:17:51,758
There's vent shafts
every 2 miles.

1528
01:17:51,859 --> 01:17:53,417
I mean with a truck.

1529
01:17:53,528 --> 01:17:56,429
At the coffer dam.
You can get a truck in there.

1530
01:17:56,531 --> 01:17:59,295
Follow saw mill parkway up there.
It's about 20 miles.

1531
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,300
I'll meet you right there,
O.K.?

1532
01:18:01,402 --> 01:18:03,029
What am I doing?

1533
01:18:03,137 --> 01:18:04,900
You're going up
to Yankee Stadium!

1534
01:18:05,006 --> 01:18:06,200
McClane!

1535
01:18:06,307 --> 01:18:08,241
Go. We got less
than two hours!

1536
01:18:08,342 --> 01:18:09,741
Goddamn it!

1537
01:18:15,149 --> 01:18:17,379
Hey! Is something wrong?

1538
01:18:17,485 --> 01:18:19,886
480 yards of rock
moved so far.

1539
01:18:19,987 --> 01:18:22,387
Now, that's 10 times
the Hoover Dam.

1540
01:18:22,490 --> 01:18:25,982
Right now, there's 560 feet of rock
above our head.

1541
01:18:26,094 --> 01:18:28,722
This part is phase three
of tunnel three.

1542
01:18:28,830 --> 01:18:31,731
Planning for it
began back in 1954,

1543
01:18:31,833 --> 01:18:34,233
But construction didn't begin
tillJune of 1970.

1544
01:18:34,335 --> 01:18:37,736
You know what the most interesting part
of tunnel three is?

1545
01:18:37,839 --> 01:18:39,067
What's that,Jerry?

1546
01:18:39,173 --> 01:18:40,731
The valves. Each one...

1547
01:18:47,548 --> 01:18:51,245
Main departure
from tunnels one and two.

1548
01:18:52,353 --> 01:18:53,411
Come on!

1549
01:18:53,521 --> 01:18:56,081
What a hell of a place
to break down.

1550
01:18:56,190 --> 01:18:59,250
Hold it. Let me have your hard hat.
Got a jacket?

1551
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:00,918
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Here.

1552
01:19:01,028 --> 01:19:02,996
Wait here a minute.

1553
01:19:03,097 --> 01:19:06,498
Wait until he gets
alongside the door.

1554
01:19:06,601 --> 01:19:07,533
Hey! Fellas!

1555
01:19:07,635 --> 01:19:08,863
Mickey O'Brien,
aqueduct security.

1556
01:19:08,970 --> 01:19:11,803
We got a report
of a guy coming through here

1557
01:19:11,906 --> 01:19:13,134
with eight reindeer.

1558
01:19:20,648 --> 01:19:23,549
Yeah, they said he was
a jolly old fat guy

1559
01:19:23,651 --> 01:19:25,209
with a snowy white beard.

1560
01:19:25,319 --> 01:19:26,877
Cute red and white suit.

1561
01:19:26,988 --> 01:19:28,888
I'm surprised
you didn't see him.

1562
01:19:31,492 --> 01:19:33,892
What's with you guys
and these phones?

1563
01:19:35,763 --> 01:19:36,661
Give me something.

1564
01:19:38,332 --> 01:19:41,563
Holy shit.
Is that guy dead?

1565
01:19:41,669 --> 01:19:43,728
Yes,Jerry.
I'm afraid he is.

1566
01:19:43,838 --> 01:19:45,169
Jesus Christ.

1567
01:19:45,273 --> 01:19:49,676
I want you to get ahold
of a guy named Cobb.

1568
01:19:49,777 --> 01:19:52,746
walter Cobb. C-O-B-B.
He's the head of my police unit.

1569
01:19:52,847 --> 01:19:55,748
Get him down here.
Tell him you were with John McClane.

1570
01:19:55,850 --> 01:19:59,013
Tell him to find out
who the 21 st president was.

1571
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,553
Chester A. Arthur.

1572
01:20:00,655 --> 01:20:01,553
What?

1573
01:20:01,656 --> 01:20:03,317
Chester A. Arthur.

1574
01:20:03,424 --> 01:20:04,914
1881 to 1885.

1575
01:20:05,026 --> 01:20:06,755
Nominated vice president
in 1880.

1576
01:20:06,861 --> 01:20:10,695
Did you know he was
Collector of Customs here in New York?

1577
01:20:10,865 --> 01:20:13,197
No, I didn't know that,Jerry.

1578
01:20:13,301 --> 01:20:14,700
Take care of yourself.

1579
01:21:18,499 --> 01:21:20,899
We got to release
these traffic guys.

1580
01:21:21,002 --> 01:21:23,562
No. Traffic jams
we can take care of later.

1581
01:21:23,671 --> 01:21:25,036
What's wrong with this?

1582
01:21:25,139 --> 01:21:26,504
Frequencies are jammed.

1583
01:21:26,607 --> 01:21:27,869
What about Ricky?

1584
01:21:27,975 --> 01:21:29,772
Can't reach him. Walter.
Federal Reserve.

1585
01:21:29,877 --> 01:21:30,775
Yeah?

1586
01:21:30,878 --> 01:21:32,903
Biggest gold storage
in the world.

1587
01:21:34,148 --> 01:21:36,048
Get a unit
back down there.

1588
01:21:36,150 --> 01:21:39,449
Find Ricky. Find out
what the hell is going on.

1589
01:21:39,553 --> 01:21:41,817
Walter! You got to hear this!

1590
01:21:46,494 --> 01:21:49,395
I thought we were
going in the back way.

1591
01:21:49,497 --> 01:21:51,055
This is the back way.

1592
01:21:51,165 --> 01:21:54,566
You're about to have
a riot at every school in the city.

1593
01:22:00,341 --> 01:22:03,333
Start at the top floor,
20 men per floor.

1594
01:22:03,444 --> 01:22:06,845
Send the other 50 men to the basement
with us. What about McClane?

1595
01:22:06,947 --> 01:22:09,347
Not a word. I'm getting nothing.
Busy signal.

1596
01:22:09,450 --> 01:22:12,783
This is kind of putting all our eggs
in one basket, isn't it?

1597
01:22:12,887 --> 01:22:14,115
What if McClane's wrong?

1598
01:22:14,221 --> 01:22:16,189
Walter. This is Principal Martinez.

1599
01:22:16,290 --> 01:22:17,188
Inspector Cobb.

1600
01:22:17,291 --> 01:22:18,849
How do you do, inspector?

1601
01:22:18,959 --> 01:22:21,359
Principal, I don't want to alarm
your children.

1602
01:22:21,462 --> 01:22:24,795
Move them all into the auditorium
and keep them calm.

1603
01:22:42,783 --> 01:22:44,683
We're coming to the dam.

1604
01:22:44,785 --> 01:22:46,685
You can call the rear guard.

1605
01:22:51,826 --> 01:22:54,386
Rear guard.
You can close up now.

1606
01:22:55,830 --> 01:22:58,560
We've reached the dam.
You can come up now.

1607
01:22:59,834 --> 01:23:00,766
Nils.

1608
01:23:00,868 --> 01:23:02,563
You can close in now.

1609
01:23:03,838 --> 01:23:04,827
Nils.

1610
01:23:04,939 --> 01:23:07,430
Attention, attention.
Nils is dead.

1611
01:23:07,541 --> 01:23:09,600
I repeat-
Nils is dead, fuckhead.

1612
01:23:09,710 --> 01:23:12,042
So's his pal...
and those four guys

1613
01:23:12,146 --> 01:23:15,377
from the East German all-stars-
your boys at the bank-

1614
01:23:15,483 --> 01:23:16,916
They'll be a little late.

1615
01:23:17,017 --> 01:23:18,507
John.

1616
01:23:19,787 --> 01:23:22,187
In the back of the truck
you're driving,

1617
01:23:22,289 --> 01:23:24,689
there's $13 billion
worth in gold bullion.

1618
01:23:24,792 --> 01:23:27,192
Would a deal be out
of the question?

1619
01:23:27,294 --> 01:23:29,387
I got a deal for you.

1620
01:23:29,497 --> 01:23:33,194
Come out of hiding,
and I'll drive this truck up your ass.

1621
01:23:34,468 --> 01:23:35,730
How colorful.

1622
01:23:41,809 --> 01:23:44,209
I told you not to toy with him!

1623
01:23:44,311 --> 01:23:46,211
Thank you.
That's very helpful.

1624
01:23:49,316 --> 01:23:52,376
You jeopardized the mission
and the contract.

1625
01:23:52,486 --> 01:23:53,384
Ivan.

1626
01:23:54,488 --> 01:23:56,888
Herr Vogle will help me
reach the ship.

1627
01:23:56,991 --> 01:23:59,391
I'm going to put
an end to this.

1628
01:24:00,828 --> 01:24:02,352
Stop!

1629
01:24:05,499 --> 01:24:06,557
Targo!

1630
01:24:06,667 --> 01:24:07,565
Targo!

1631
01:24:07,668 --> 01:24:09,067
Here! Come here!

1632
01:24:10,838 --> 01:24:12,169
We blow the dam.

1633
01:24:12,273 --> 01:24:13,171
What?

1634
01:24:13,274 --> 01:24:14,741
We drown him.

1635
01:24:21,749 --> 01:24:24,650
Up there!

1636
01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:28,087
Walter!

1637
01:24:28,189 --> 01:24:29,747
Take a look at this.

1638
01:24:29,857 --> 01:24:33,486
Janitor said it was delivered
this morning. About 10:30, right?

1639
01:24:33,594 --> 01:24:34,993
Not hooked up.

1640
01:24:35,095 --> 01:24:35,993
Yeah?

1641
01:24:36,096 --> 01:24:38,496
O.K. Now take a look
at the front.

1642
01:24:40,968 --> 01:24:43,493
We drill the hinges.
Get everybody out.

1643
01:25:10,097 --> 01:25:10,927
Unh!

1644
01:25:17,805 --> 01:25:19,329
Unh...

1645
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:20,372
Unh!

1646
01:26:41,922 --> 01:26:43,651
Whoa...

1647
01:26:43,757 --> 01:26:45,019
Whoa!

1648
01:26:57,905 --> 01:26:59,202
Aah!

1649
01:27:05,212 --> 01:27:06,804
Aah!

1650
01:27:06,914 --> 01:27:07,812
Uhh!

1651
01:27:14,321 --> 01:27:15,310
McClane!

1652
01:27:17,424 --> 01:27:19,119
McClane!

1653
01:27:19,226 --> 01:27:20,557
Where are you?

1654
01:27:20,661 --> 01:27:21,628
Over here!

1655
01:27:21,729 --> 01:27:25,324
Hell of a way of flagging
somebody down.

1656
01:27:25,432 --> 01:27:26,558
Did you go to Yankee Stadium?

1657
01:27:26,667 --> 01:27:28,134
Yeah. There's nobody there.

1658
01:27:28,235 --> 01:27:29,634
You didn't see nobody?

1659
01:27:29,737 --> 01:27:31,602
Nobody was following you?

1660
01:27:31,705 --> 01:27:32,933
He's jerking us around.

1661
01:27:35,476 --> 01:27:36,943
Come on! Come on!

1662
01:27:37,044 --> 01:27:38,636
Holy shit!

1663
01:27:38,746 --> 01:27:39,735
Go! Go! Go!

1664
01:27:44,318 --> 01:27:46,252
It's not rigged.

1665
01:27:46,353 --> 01:27:47,411
Pull it.

1666
01:27:58,699 --> 01:28:01,759
Well, I'd say you could
call off your search.

1667
01:28:01,869 --> 01:28:03,496
Can you stop it?

1668
01:28:03,604 --> 01:28:05,731
I shouldn't even touch it.

1669
01:28:05,839 --> 01:28:08,501
Who knows what booby traps
this thing's got?

1670
01:28:08,609 --> 01:28:09,906
What about the code?

1671
01:28:10,010 --> 01:28:11,034
No word.

1672
01:28:11,145 --> 01:28:12,544
When do we evacuate?

1673
01:28:12,646 --> 01:28:15,877
Simon says he sees one kid
leave the building-boom.

1674
01:28:15,983 --> 01:28:18,884
We can't stand here
with our thumb up our ass

1675
01:28:18,986 --> 01:28:21,546
waiting for this
freaking thing to blow up!

1676
01:28:28,095 --> 01:28:29,027
Shit!

1677
01:28:29,129 --> 01:28:31,222
Keep your head down!

1678
01:28:31,331 --> 01:28:32,923
Hold it steady!

1679
01:28:37,004 --> 01:28:38,096
Go! Go!

1680
01:28:38,205 --> 01:28:39,502
They're in our way!

1681
01:28:39,606 --> 01:28:41,073
Go around them!

1682
01:28:53,887 --> 01:28:56,583
I found out who's
the 21 st president-

1683
01:28:56,690 --> 01:28:58,055
some guy named Arthur.

1684
01:28:58,158 --> 01:28:59,557
Chester A. Arthur?

1685
01:28:59,660 --> 01:29:01,423
Chester A. Arthur
elementary school?

1686
01:29:01,528 --> 01:29:02,426
That's it.

1687
01:29:02,529 --> 01:29:05,965
# Gently down the stream #

1688
01:29:06,066 --> 01:29:08,762
# Merrily, merrily,
merrily, merrily #

1689
01:29:08,869 --> 01:29:11,201
# Life is but a dream... ##

1690
01:29:26,487 --> 01:29:27,647
Hi, kids.

1691
01:29:27,755 --> 01:29:30,724
I know you usually have
assembly on Fridays,

1692
01:29:30,824 --> 01:29:32,223
but today is special.

1693
01:29:32,326 --> 01:29:35,227
Mr. Lambert here
is from the Fire Department.

1694
01:29:35,329 --> 01:29:37,229
Today he wants us to practice

1695
01:29:37,331 --> 01:29:39,799
a brand-new fire drill.

1696
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:42,334
I want you to divide in half.

1697
01:29:42,436 --> 01:29:44,336
Half of you go over here

1698
01:29:44,438 --> 01:29:46,838
and line up against the wall.

1699
01:29:46,940 --> 01:29:49,272
The other half go
in this direction.

1700
01:29:49,376 --> 01:29:52,072
Do it very quietly
and very quickly.

1701
01:29:52,179 --> 01:29:53,407
Everybody up, please.

1702
01:29:53,514 --> 01:29:54,913
Teachers, please help them.

1703
01:29:55,015 --> 01:29:56,312
Fire drill, my ass.

1704
01:29:56,416 --> 01:29:57,678
The Fire Department...

1705
01:29:57,785 --> 01:30:00,447
Maybe it's because of the radio.

1706
01:30:00,554 --> 01:30:03,580
You mean,
like they're after us?

1707
01:30:03,724 --> 01:30:05,089
Tommy squealed on us.

1708
01:30:05,192 --> 01:30:06,591
No, he didn't.

1709
01:30:06,693 --> 01:30:07,751
Come on.

1710
01:30:09,029 --> 01:30:10,496
Where you going?

1711
01:30:13,233 --> 01:30:14,632
Let me drive!

1712
01:30:14,735 --> 01:30:15,633
Go! Go!

1713
01:30:15,736 --> 01:30:17,294
Goddamn it!

1714
01:30:17,404 --> 01:30:21,306
Of course he put the bomb
up in that school.

1715
01:30:21,408 --> 01:30:23,205
Why would he do that?

1716
01:30:23,310 --> 01:30:25,039
To get your complete attention.

1717
01:30:29,449 --> 01:30:31,542
Find the fuse panel.

1718
01:30:31,652 --> 01:30:32,710
What?

1719
01:30:32,820 --> 01:30:34,219
Where's the fuse panel?

1720
01:30:34,321 --> 01:30:36,221
Pull out the antilock-brakes fuse.

1721
01:30:36,323 --> 01:30:37,517
Which one is it?

1722
01:30:37,624 --> 01:30:38,955
Yank them all out.

1723
01:30:39,059 --> 01:30:41,050
Put your head down.

1724
01:30:41,161 --> 01:30:43,823
Put your head fucking down.

1725
01:30:43,931 --> 01:30:45,330
Listen to me.

1726
01:30:45,432 --> 01:30:48,595
Hang the fuck on,
all right?

1727
01:31:13,994 --> 01:31:16,360
What the fuck happened?

1728
01:31:16,463 --> 01:31:18,988
You got a "Triple-A" card?

1729
01:31:19,099 --> 01:31:20,532
Keep moving.
Keep moving.

1730
01:31:20,634 --> 01:31:24,035
I've got the janitors
making a last sweep of the building.

1731
01:31:24,137 --> 01:31:25,866
Thank you, Miss Martinez.

1732
01:31:42,489 --> 01:31:43,717
Come on.

1733
01:31:45,225 --> 01:31:48,592
All right.
3s and 9s are wild.

1734
01:31:48,695 --> 01:31:50,128
Stay down.
Stay low.

1735
01:31:59,172 --> 01:32:01,766
Oh, man.

1736
01:32:04,177 --> 01:32:05,804
What are you doing?

1737
01:32:05,913 --> 01:32:06,971
Interrogating him.

1738
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:09,014
What's he going
to tell you?

1739
01:32:09,116 --> 01:32:11,448
I won't know
till I ask him.

1740
01:32:11,551 --> 01:32:14,281
See if there's aspirin
in that glove box.

1741
01:32:14,388 --> 01:32:16,618
No way. You do it.

1742
01:32:22,129 --> 01:32:23,187
10 quarters.

1743
01:32:23,297 --> 01:32:26,198
The guy in the dump truck
had 10 quarters.

1744
01:32:26,300 --> 01:32:27,631
Exactly 10 quarters.

1745
01:32:27,734 --> 01:32:30,703
Maybe they were making
long-distance phone calls.

1746
01:32:30,804 --> 01:32:31,862
No.

1747
01:32:31,972 --> 01:32:33,371
They're for the bridge,

1748
01:32:33,473 --> 01:32:36,374
it's for the toll
on the bridge.

1749
01:32:38,145 --> 01:32:39,203
There! There!

1750
01:32:39,313 --> 01:32:41,713
Down on the wharf-
dump trucks.

1751
01:32:41,815 --> 01:32:43,715
Right there.
Right there.

1752
01:32:45,319 --> 01:32:49,221
They got it loaded
on a ship already.

1753
01:32:49,323 --> 01:32:50,654
Shit!

1754
01:32:50,757 --> 01:32:52,657
How about the Coast Guard?

1755
01:32:52,759 --> 01:32:54,158
Take them an hour
to get here.

1756
01:32:54,261 --> 01:32:56,058
Shit!

1757
01:32:56,163 --> 01:32:57,494
We can jump.

1758
01:32:57,597 --> 01:32:58,495
What?

1759
01:32:58,598 --> 01:33:01,066
It's 100 feet
down to the deck.

1760
01:33:01,168 --> 01:33:03,193
But not to the crane.

1761
01:33:03,303 --> 01:33:05,737
The cables would
cut you in half.

1762
01:33:05,839 --> 01:33:07,602
I can make it.

1763
01:33:07,708 --> 01:33:10,677
Get down.
Look in the car for some gloves.

1764
01:33:13,714 --> 01:33:15,341
Six booby traps,

1765
01:33:15,449 --> 01:33:16,882
four dead ends,

1766
01:33:16,984 --> 01:33:19,544
#And a partridge
in a pear tree ##

1767
01:33:23,790 --> 01:33:26,190
O.K., honey...

1768
01:33:26,293 --> 01:33:28,284
let's dance.

1769
01:33:28,395 --> 01:33:30,192
We're going to have a race.

1770
01:33:30,297 --> 01:33:32,697
When I say "go,"
run like crazy.

1771
01:33:32,799 --> 01:33:35,199
Follow the police officer
and the firemen.

1772
01:33:35,302 --> 01:33:38,203
Walter, I think we're cutting this
a little thin.

1773
01:33:38,305 --> 01:33:40,205
No. We're going to wait.

1774
01:33:40,307 --> 01:33:42,639
McClane still
may get the code.

1775
01:33:44,945 --> 01:33:46,572
Line me up
with that crane.

1776
01:33:46,680 --> 01:33:47,942
Right there.

1777
01:33:48,048 --> 01:33:49,811
You're O.K.

1778
01:33:51,585 --> 01:33:53,553
This will take a miracle.

1779
01:33:53,653 --> 01:33:55,177
Keep your fingers crossed.

1780
01:33:56,289 --> 01:33:57,916
You almost got it.

1781
01:33:58,025 --> 01:33:59,822
Yeah! All right.

1782
01:33:59,926 --> 01:34:02,394
Where you going?
You in a hurry?

1783
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:04,088
I'm going first this time.

1784
01:34:04,197 --> 01:34:06,722
We have the intercom rigged, sir.

1785
01:34:06,833 --> 01:34:09,233
Walter, the kids may be fine,

1786
01:34:09,336 --> 01:34:10,928
But you wait much longer

1787
01:34:11,038 --> 01:34:12,733
and I'll pee
in my pants.

1788
01:34:12,839 --> 01:34:14,830
We're going to wait,
Connie.

1789
01:34:14,941 --> 01:34:16,932
Six more minutes.

1790
01:34:31,291 --> 01:34:32,258
Yo.

1791
01:34:32,359 --> 01:34:33,417
McClane.

1792
01:34:33,527 --> 01:34:35,256
Down there.

1793
01:34:44,805 --> 01:34:45,703
Oh, shit.

1794
01:34:45,806 --> 01:34:47,899
Go, man.
Go. Go. Go.

1795
01:34:57,384 --> 01:35:00,410
Aah!

1796
01:35:08,662 --> 01:35:11,563
Aah!
Whoa!

1797
01:35:13,733 --> 01:35:14,859
Ohh...

1798
01:35:14,968 --> 01:35:16,367
Boy, am I glad

1799
01:35:16,470 --> 01:35:19,200
you talked me
out of jumping.

1800
01:35:44,965 --> 01:35:46,262
Fuck.

1801
01:35:47,467 --> 01:35:48,866
Get his feet.

1802
01:36:29,342 --> 01:36:30,809
You go find Simon

1803
01:36:30,911 --> 01:36:34,005
and beat the fucking
code out of him.

1804
01:36:34,114 --> 01:36:35,513
Here. Take this.

1805
01:36:35,615 --> 01:36:37,014
How's it work?

1806
01:36:37,117 --> 01:36:39,483
You don't know how
to shoot a gun?

1807
01:36:39,586 --> 01:36:41,918
All brothers don't know
how to shoot guns.

1808
01:36:42,022 --> 01:36:44,923
Yank back on that,
pull the trigger.

1809
01:36:45,025 --> 01:36:46,083
That's it?

1810
01:36:46,193 --> 01:36:47,592
Just don't shoot yourself.

1811
01:36:47,694 --> 01:36:49,594
Hey. Don't be no hero.

1812
01:36:49,696 --> 01:36:51,960
You find him, come get me.

1813
01:37:18,024 --> 01:37:19,719
Stupid!

1814
01:37:19,826 --> 01:37:20,793
Stupid!

1815
01:38:02,869 --> 01:38:04,496
You have the autopilot set?

1816
01:38:04,604 --> 01:38:05,662
Yes, sir.

1817
01:38:05,772 --> 01:38:07,069
Good.

1818
01:38:12,479 --> 01:38:14,413
Don't fucking move.

1819
01:38:20,153 --> 01:38:22,815
Oh, the samaritan.

1820
01:38:22,922 --> 01:38:24,412
Give me the goddamn code.

1821
01:38:24,524 --> 01:38:25,548
Code?

1822
01:38:25,659 --> 01:38:26,717
Oh.

1823
01:38:26,826 --> 01:38:28,726
You mean for the school.

1824
01:38:28,828 --> 01:38:29,886
I'm sorry.

1825
01:38:29,996 --> 01:38:31,156
I can't do that.

1826
01:38:31,264 --> 01:38:33,732
You call in that code
right now,

1827
01:38:33,833 --> 01:38:37,234
or I blow your sick ass
into the next world.

1828
01:38:37,337 --> 01:38:39,999
If that's what
you got to do...

1829
01:38:52,519 --> 01:38:54,214
You've got to take
the safety catch off.

1830
01:38:54,321 --> 01:38:55,219
Ugh!

1831
01:38:55,322 --> 01:38:56,254
God!

1832
01:38:56,356 --> 01:38:57,823
See? That works.

1833
01:38:57,924 --> 01:38:59,983
Now where's McClane?

1834
01:39:12,472 --> 01:39:13,461
Nicht schiessen!

1835
01:39:16,309 --> 01:39:18,243
What was that?

1836
01:39:22,816 --> 01:39:25,307
He said, " Don't shoot. "

1837
01:39:25,452 --> 01:39:29,479
O.K., Charlie, we'll have to go
with the evacuation.

1838
01:39:29,589 --> 01:39:30,681
We're going to go.

1839
01:39:30,790 --> 01:39:32,348
You heard the man!
Let's go!

1840
01:39:32,459 --> 01:39:33,858
We're going to go.

1841
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:35,359
On my mark...

1842
01:39:35,462 --> 01:39:38,056
5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

1843
01:39:38,164 --> 01:39:39,062
go!

1844
01:39:39,165 --> 01:39:41,725
Go! Go! Go! Go!

1845
01:39:41,835 --> 01:39:43,359
Let's do it.

1846
01:39:43,470 --> 01:39:45,734
O.K., gang. Let's go!

1847
01:39:45,839 --> 01:39:47,238
Go! Go! Go!

1848
01:39:47,340 --> 01:39:49,001
Hip-hop! Hip-hop!

1849
01:39:49,109 --> 01:39:50,940
Run! Run! Run! Run!

1850
01:39:51,044 --> 01:39:52,341
We're going to win!

1851
01:39:52,445 --> 01:39:54,436
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1852
01:39:54,547 --> 01:39:55,912
Let's go! Keep moving!

1853
01:39:56,015 --> 01:39:56,913
Hurry up!

1854
01:39:58,618 --> 01:39:59,642
Ugh!

1855
01:40:06,526 --> 01:40:08,118
Keep going!

1856
01:40:08,228 --> 01:40:10,059
Look what they doing.

1857
01:40:11,798 --> 01:40:13,857
Yo! Where you going?

1858
01:40:13,967 --> 01:40:15,958
- What's going on?
- Where you going?

1859
01:40:16,069 --> 01:40:18,469
I see you all day,
little man,

1860
01:40:18,571 --> 01:40:19,595
policeman...

1861
01:40:20,974 --> 01:40:23,033
and you don't go away.

1862
01:40:23,143 --> 01:40:26,010
I'm like that fucking
Energizer bunny.

1863
01:40:28,314 --> 01:40:30,009
Where you going now, huh?

1864
01:40:33,386 --> 01:40:35,877
Going to arrest me, bunny?

1865
01:40:35,989 --> 01:40:38,048
Huh?

1866
01:40:38,158 --> 01:40:41,218
I think I'm going rest.

1867
01:40:41,327 --> 01:40:42,760
I'm kind of weak.

1868
01:40:53,339 --> 01:40:55,239
I knew it was bullshit.

1869
01:40:55,341 --> 01:40:56,740
There's nobody watching.

1870
01:40:56,843 --> 01:40:58,242
Time to get Charlie out.

1871
01:40:58,344 --> 01:40:59,436
Time's up.

1872
01:40:59,546 --> 01:41:01,446
Give me another 30 seconds.

1873
01:41:01,548 --> 01:41:04,278
It takes a minute 15
if you're a kid.

1874
01:41:04,384 --> 01:41:07,945
Last I looked,
you weren't too light on your feet.

1875
01:41:08,054 --> 01:41:10,045
Oh, my God!

1876
01:41:12,358 --> 01:41:14,258
Get them out of there!

1877
01:41:14,360 --> 01:41:15,759
The rooms are locked.

1878
01:41:15,862 --> 01:41:17,261
Out of my way!

1879
01:41:17,363 --> 01:41:19,456
Hey!

1880
01:41:19,566 --> 01:41:21,397
Any one marked "4."

1881
01:41:22,635 --> 01:41:24,034
What's going on, Walter?

1882
01:41:24,137 --> 01:41:26,537
We still have kids
in the building.

1883
01:41:31,811 --> 01:41:32,869
I'm staying.

1884
01:41:32,979 --> 01:41:35,379
No, Charlie.
Get out of there.

1885
01:41:36,883 --> 01:41:39,215
Ever see that show
The Addams Family?

1886
01:41:39,319 --> 01:41:41,787
They got a motherfucker
on there called Lurch.

1887
01:41:41,888 --> 01:41:44,948
You don't think I'm going to let you
get to that gun?

1888
01:41:46,326 --> 01:41:47,258
Oh.

1889
01:41:50,029 --> 01:41:50,961
Fuck!

1890
01:42:12,285 --> 01:42:13,183
Four... four...

1891
01:42:13,286 --> 01:42:14,981
Get out of the way!

1892
01:42:26,466 --> 01:42:27,865
Where are they, Walter?

1893
01:42:27,967 --> 01:42:29,730
Still in.

1894
01:42:35,642 --> 01:42:37,200
No guts...

1895
01:42:37,310 --> 01:42:38,368
no glory.

1896
01:42:41,447 --> 01:42:44,610
We can jump
to the next building!

1897
01:42:44,717 --> 01:42:45,706
Shit!

1898
01:42:45,818 --> 01:42:47,217
O.K.

1899
01:42:47,320 --> 01:42:49,220
O.K. Come on.
Come on.

1900
01:42:49,322 --> 01:42:52,291
Come on,
get them up here.

1901
01:42:52,392 --> 01:42:53,620
Come on. Come on.

1902
01:42:53,726 --> 01:42:54,624
Mayday! Mayday!

1903
01:42:54,727 --> 01:42:55,887
Bridgeport Coast Guard!

1904
01:42:55,995 --> 01:42:57,519
Coast Guard, come in.

1905
01:43:10,843 --> 01:43:12,174
Come on, kids!

1906
01:43:16,616 --> 01:43:18,049
Shit! It's too far!

1907
01:43:25,959 --> 01:43:27,654
No guts, no glory.

1908
01:43:28,761 --> 01:43:31,559
It's a big fucking white boat.

1909
01:43:31,664 --> 01:43:33,461
Please stay
on the line.

1910
01:43:51,584 --> 01:43:53,814
Pancake syrup?

1911
01:43:53,953 --> 01:43:55,682
Stupid...
stupid...

1912
01:43:58,658 --> 01:44:01,024
Hello,John McClane.

1913
01:44:01,127 --> 01:44:04,528
There was never
any bomb in the school.

1914
01:44:04,631 --> 01:44:06,223
Of course not.

1915
01:44:06,332 --> 01:44:08,732
I'm a soldier,
not a monster,

1916
01:44:08,835 --> 01:44:12,168
even though I sometimes
work for monsters.

1917
01:44:12,271 --> 01:44:13,670
No.

1918
01:44:13,773 --> 01:44:16,173
The real bomb
is on this ship.

1919
01:44:19,779 --> 01:44:21,713
Coast Guard.

1920
01:44:21,814 --> 01:44:25,682
I was telling them
where the boat was.

1921
01:44:25,785 --> 01:44:28,049
Game over, huh?

1922
01:44:28,154 --> 01:44:29,553
Not quite over.

1923
01:44:29,656 --> 01:44:32,147
Bridgeport Coast Guard,

1924
01:44:32,258 --> 01:44:34,556
come in, please.

1925
01:44:34,661 --> 01:44:36,185
They put you on hold?

1926
01:44:36,295 --> 01:44:39,196
She told me
to stay on the line.

1927
01:44:43,469 --> 01:44:45,494
Oh, God,
I love this country.

1928
01:44:45,605 --> 01:44:48,301
You know,
your brother was an asshole.

1929
01:44:48,408 --> 01:44:50,205
He really
was an asshole.

1930
01:44:50,309 --> 01:44:51,708
He was an asshole.

1931
01:44:51,811 --> 01:44:53,711
You got his number.

1932
01:44:54,947 --> 01:44:56,209
Yeah, O.K.

1933
01:44:57,817 --> 01:44:59,250
Forgive me.

1934
01:44:59,352 --> 01:45:02,219
Would you help
Mr. McClane below?

1935
01:45:02,321 --> 01:45:03,379
Ohh.

1936
01:45:03,489 --> 01:45:05,650
Careful now.

1937
01:45:05,758 --> 01:45:09,387
Now, do you have
the communique?

1938
01:45:09,495 --> 01:45:10,393
Bridgeport radio.

1939
01:45:10,496 --> 01:45:11,827
Come in, please,
Bridgeport.

1940
01:45:11,931 --> 01:45:12,989
Coast Guard.

1941
01:45:13,099 --> 01:45:14,498
Oh, you're there, dear.

1942
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:15,999
Yes, we're here.

1943
01:45:16,102 --> 01:45:18,502
Will you be able
to record a message?

1944
01:45:18,604 --> 01:45:19,502
Yes.

1945
01:45:19,605 --> 01:45:21,436
Then please begin now.

1946
01:45:26,779 --> 01:45:29,179
This is a communiqu
from the CRF.

1947
01:45:29,282 --> 01:45:30,579
For too long,

1948
01:45:30,683 --> 01:45:32,082
the West has conspired

1949
01:45:32,185 --> 01:45:34,415
to steal the wealth
of the world,

1950
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:36,420
consigning the balance of humanity

1951
01:45:36,522 --> 01:45:38,581
to economic starvation.

1952
01:45:38,691 --> 01:45:41,182
Today, we will level
the playing field.

1953
01:45:41,294 --> 01:45:44,058
In minutes, the contents
of the federal reserve bank-

1954
01:45:44,163 --> 01:45:47,291
the gold your economies
are built on-

1955
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:49,698
will be redistributed
by explosive

1956
01:45:49,802 --> 01:45:53,533
Across the bottom
of the Long Island Sound.

1957
01:45:53,639 --> 01:45:55,698
If you are not
in gridlock,

1958
01:45:55,808 --> 01:45:57,173
come and watch.

1959
01:46:01,447 --> 01:46:03,711
You going
to blow it all up?

1960
01:46:03,816 --> 01:46:05,215
That's the idea.

1961
01:46:05,318 --> 01:46:07,218
Some gentlemen
in the Middle East

1962
01:46:07,320 --> 01:46:09,720
think they'll make
lots of money.

1963
01:46:09,822 --> 01:46:12,222
See the men
safely off the ship,

1964
01:46:12,325 --> 01:46:14,725
and I'll see you
on the launch.

1965
01:46:14,827 --> 01:46:17,455
What's this got to do
with killing McClane?

1966
01:46:18,831 --> 01:46:20,731
Life has its little bonuses.

1967
01:46:20,833 --> 01:46:23,734
Didn't you say you didn't
even like your brother?

1968
01:46:23,836 --> 01:46:26,066
There's a difference
between not liking one's brother

1969
01:46:26,172 --> 01:46:28,572
and not caring when
some dumb Irish flatfoot

1970
01:46:28,674 --> 01:46:29,800
drops him out a window.

1971
01:46:29,909 --> 01:46:31,934
I didn't even know
that motherfucker.

1972
01:46:32,044 --> 01:46:34,239
I never invited you
aboard this ship.

1973
01:46:34,347 --> 01:46:36,747
No riddle's going to stop
this motherfucker?

1974
01:46:36,849 --> 01:46:39,249
No code, no riddle,
no fancy countdown.

1975
01:46:39,352 --> 01:46:41,149
Hey, fuckhead.

1976
01:46:41,254 --> 01:46:42,812
Yeah, you-fuckhead.

1977
01:46:42,922 --> 01:46:47,018
Just one thing
I got to know-

1978
01:46:47,126 --> 01:46:48,753
you got any aspirins?

1979
01:46:48,861 --> 01:46:51,261
I've had a bad
fucking headache

1980
01:46:51,364 --> 01:46:52,729
all day long.

1981
01:46:55,368 --> 01:46:57,336
Must be your lucky day.

1982
01:46:58,805 --> 01:47:00,204
Keep the bottle.

1983
01:47:00,306 --> 01:47:01,364
Right.

1984
01:47:12,718 --> 01:47:14,549
Where is the gold?

1985
01:47:16,055 --> 01:47:17,886
He's betrayed us.

1986
01:47:17,990 --> 01:47:20,925
The containers
are filled with that...

1987
01:47:54,527 --> 01:47:56,927
If I hadn't saved
your fucking ass,

1988
01:47:57,029 --> 01:47:59,930
I wouldn't be here about to blow up
with $100 billion.

1989
01:48:00,032 --> 01:48:02,432
You're only going
to blow up with me.

1990
01:48:02,535 --> 01:48:04,264
There's no gold
on this boat.

1991
01:48:04,370 --> 01:48:05,769
How do you know?

1992
01:48:05,872 --> 01:48:07,271
I know the family.

1993
01:48:07,373 --> 01:48:10,274
Only thing better than blowing up
$100 billion

1994
01:48:10,376 --> 01:48:12,207
is making people
think you did.

1995
01:48:12,311 --> 01:48:13,710
Well, where is it?

1996
01:48:13,813 --> 01:48:15,713
He must have
switched it somewhere.

1997
01:48:15,815 --> 01:48:18,215
That supposed to make me
feel better?

1998
01:48:18,317 --> 01:48:19,375
You're wrong.

1999
01:48:19,485 --> 01:48:20,884
You're not
going to die.

2000
01:48:20,987 --> 01:48:23,888
You know some cop trick
about handcuffs to get us out?

2001
01:48:23,990 --> 01:48:25,389
Yeah. Use a key.

2002
01:48:25,491 --> 01:48:27,721
You know how
to pick this lock?

2003
01:48:27,827 --> 01:48:30,227
Is this some
black shit again?

2004
01:48:30,329 --> 01:48:32,729
Are you a fucking locksmith
or not?

2005
01:48:32,832 --> 01:48:35,232
I need something
to do it with.

2006
01:48:35,334 --> 01:48:37,734
How about a splinter
of that cable?

2007
01:48:40,172 --> 01:48:41,230
Hold on.

2008
01:48:41,340 --> 01:48:43,740
What the fuck
are you doing?

2009
01:48:43,843 --> 01:48:45,970
Uh!

2010
01:48:46,078 --> 01:48:47,909
Fuck! Shit!

2011
01:48:48,014 --> 01:48:49,914
How's that?
that big enough?

2012
01:48:50,016 --> 01:48:51,415
Yeah. That might work.

2013
01:48:51,517 --> 01:48:53,917
I'm going to drop it
in your hand.

2014
01:48:54,020 --> 01:48:55,419
Cup your hand.

2015
01:48:55,521 --> 01:48:56,920
Don't drop
this motherfucker.

2016
01:48:57,023 --> 01:48:58,923
Get it in the right.

2017
01:48:59,025 --> 01:49:00,083
You ready?

2018
01:49:00,192 --> 01:49:02,626
1... 2... spit it.

2019
01:49:02,728 --> 01:49:03,786
Yeah!

2020
01:49:03,896 --> 01:49:04,794
Get it?

2021
01:49:04,897 --> 01:49:06,159
Move your hands.

2022
01:49:06,265 --> 01:49:07,755
O.K.

2023
01:49:07,867 --> 01:49:08,925
Damn, McClane,

2024
01:49:09,035 --> 01:49:11,367
I was just starting
to like you.

2025
01:49:11,470 --> 01:49:12,869
Don't. I'm an asshole.

2026
01:49:12,972 --> 01:49:14,872
What are you
talking about?

2027
01:49:14,974 --> 01:49:16,373
I lied to you.

2028
01:49:16,475 --> 01:49:17,635
About what?

2029
01:49:17,743 --> 01:49:21,372
Remember I said Weiss
found that bomb up in Harlem?

2030
01:49:21,480 --> 01:49:23,880
They found it
down in Chinatown.

2031
01:49:23,983 --> 01:49:27,384
That's low even for a white
motherfucker like you.

2032
01:49:28,721 --> 01:49:30,621
What the fuck was that?

2033
01:49:30,723 --> 01:49:32,122
I don't know.

2034
01:49:32,224 --> 01:49:34,624
Look, it was the only way

2035
01:49:34,727 --> 01:49:37,218
to get you to come with me.

2036
01:49:37,330 --> 01:49:38,797
You got a wife?

2037
01:49:38,898 --> 01:49:41,230
I'm surprised anybody
could stay with you

2038
01:49:41,334 --> 01:49:42,733
long enough to be married.

2039
01:49:42,835 --> 01:49:44,234
She didn't stick around.

2040
01:49:44,337 --> 01:49:45,736
We're sort of separated.

2041
01:49:45,838 --> 01:49:48,739
She was in L.A.,
I was in New York,

2042
01:49:48,841 --> 01:49:51,241
we had a fight
on the phone,

2043
01:49:51,344 --> 01:49:54,245
she hung up,
I didn't call her back.

2044
01:49:54,347 --> 01:49:56,247
How long ago was that?

2045
01:49:56,349 --> 01:49:57,748
About a year ago.

2046
01:49:59,185 --> 01:50:01,585
What the fuck
you laughing about?

2047
01:50:01,687 --> 01:50:03,587
You threw away
your marriage

2048
01:50:03,689 --> 01:50:06,089
because you were
too fucking stupid

2049
01:50:06,192 --> 01:50:08,092
to pick up the phone?

2050
01:50:08,194 --> 01:50:09,593
You think that's funny?

2051
01:50:09,695 --> 01:50:12,027
I bet you blame your wife, too.

2052
01:50:12,131 --> 01:50:15,032
My wife is a very stubborn woman.

2053
01:50:15,134 --> 01:50:17,034
You better stop
fucking laughing

2054
01:50:17,136 --> 01:50:18,535
and undo these cuffs.

2055
01:50:18,637 --> 01:50:19,626
They're almost...

2056
01:50:19,739 --> 01:50:20,637
there!

2057
01:50:20,740 --> 01:50:22,139
How's that
for concentration?

2058
01:50:23,309 --> 01:50:24,367
Oh, shit!

2059
01:50:24,477 --> 01:50:26,411
I dropped the pin.

2060
01:50:26,512 --> 01:50:27,911
Goddamn it!

2061
01:50:28,014 --> 01:50:29,208
Where'd it go?

2062
01:50:29,315 --> 01:50:30,304
Find it!

2063
01:50:30,416 --> 01:50:31,815
I don't see it.

2064
01:50:33,586 --> 01:50:36,020
What the fuck is that?

2065
01:50:36,122 --> 01:50:38,955
I think I made it mad.

2066
01:50:40,059 --> 01:50:43,153
Go, McClane,
get the fuck out of here.

2067
01:50:43,262 --> 01:50:46,425
Goddamn it!
Listen to me!

2068
01:50:46,532 --> 01:50:48,056
Just go.

2069
01:50:48,167 --> 01:50:50,567
It's hard enough
getting through the day

2070
01:50:50,669 --> 01:50:53,103
without your death
on my conscience.

2071
01:50:53,205 --> 01:50:55,673
All right. Tools...
Check the engine room.

2072
01:50:55,775 --> 01:50:57,003
There's no time!

2073
01:50:57,109 --> 01:50:59,236
What the hell's it doing now?

2074
01:50:59,345 --> 01:51:00,243
It's mixing.

2075
01:51:00,346 --> 01:51:01,779
Shit!

2076
01:51:01,881 --> 01:51:04,281
What the hell
are you doing?

2077
01:51:04,383 --> 01:51:05,577
Lean forward.

2078
01:51:05,684 --> 01:51:07,117
Lean forward,
goddamn it!

2079
01:51:07,219 --> 01:51:08,413
What-

2080
01:51:08,521 --> 01:51:11,012
What the fuck
are you doing?

2081
01:51:11,123 --> 01:51:12,351
Lean forward.

2082
01:51:12,458 --> 01:51:13,356
Oh, no!

2083
01:51:13,459 --> 01:51:14,653
Get ready!

2084
01:51:16,228 --> 01:51:17,627
Fucking shit! Shit!

2085
01:51:17,730 --> 01:51:19,197
Oh, goddamn!

2086
01:51:19,298 --> 01:51:20,458
Goddamn!

2087
01:51:20,566 --> 01:51:21,464
Come on!

2088
01:51:21,567 --> 01:51:22,465
Come on!

2089
01:51:22,568 --> 01:51:23,967
My leg. Ow!

2090
01:51:24,070 --> 01:51:25,594
Get up the stairs

2091
01:51:25,704 --> 01:51:27,103
Go! Go! Go! Go!

2092
01:51:27,206 --> 01:51:29,174
Get up the stairs!

2093
01:51:30,443 --> 01:51:31,501
Oh, shit!

2094
01:51:31,610 --> 01:51:32,599
Damn it!

2095
01:51:32,711 --> 01:51:34,508
Let's go!
Let's go!

2096
01:51:34,613 --> 01:51:36,012
Run, damn it!
Run!

2097
01:51:36,115 --> 01:51:37,776
I am!

2098
01:51:37,883 --> 01:51:40,181
Come on!
All right?

2099
01:51:40,286 --> 01:51:42,777
Watch, watch, watch!
Let's go!

2100
01:51:42,888 --> 01:51:45,448
Aah!
Aah!

2101
01:52:12,017 --> 01:52:13,382
How's he doing?

2102
01:52:13,486 --> 01:52:14,885
I'm shot
in the leg.

2103
01:52:14,987 --> 01:52:16,545
How you think
I'm doing?

2104
01:52:16,655 --> 01:52:18,054
He's going
to be just fine.

2105
01:52:18,157 --> 01:52:19,124
And you?

2106
01:52:19,225 --> 01:52:20,283
Fine.

2107
01:52:20,392 --> 01:52:22,189
You get Ricky
out of there?

2108
01:52:22,294 --> 01:52:24,956
Yeah, they found him.

2109
01:52:26,832 --> 01:52:28,732
You going to be
all right?

2110
01:52:28,834 --> 01:52:30,267
Got a bad headache.

2111
01:52:30,369 --> 01:52:31,768
Think they're mad at me?

2112
01:52:31,871 --> 01:52:33,463
I wouldn't worry about them.

2113
01:52:33,572 --> 01:52:34,971
They'll get to you
eventually.

2114
01:52:35,074 --> 01:52:37,133
They're busy with this
salvage operation.

2115
01:52:37,243 --> 01:52:39,177
No. Dredges!

2116
01:52:39,278 --> 01:52:40,540
Dredges!

2117
01:52:40,646 --> 01:52:42,671
There's no gold
out there.

2118
01:52:42,781 --> 01:52:44,749
What do you mean?

2119
01:52:44,850 --> 01:52:46,249
He took it.
He beat me.

2120
01:52:46,352 --> 01:52:47,751
He beat all of us.

2121
01:52:47,853 --> 01:52:49,150
He wasn't playing
against you.

2122
01:52:49,255 --> 01:52:50,654
Fuck that, McClane!

2123
01:52:50,756 --> 01:52:52,246
You're still alive,
aren't you?

2124
01:52:53,792 --> 01:52:55,419
Well, aren't you?

2125
01:52:55,528 --> 01:52:57,120
Yeah.

2126
01:52:57,229 --> 01:52:58,628
So he lost.

2127
01:52:58,731 --> 01:53:01,632
Lambert,
would you give him a quarter?

2128
01:53:02,735 --> 01:53:04,293
Asshole.

2129
01:53:08,741 --> 01:53:10,641
Yeah, it's collect from John.

2130
01:53:17,816 --> 01:53:21,377
Uh, Carmen,just tell them
you'll accept the charges.

2131
01:53:21,487 --> 01:53:23,819
Son of a bitch had aspirin.

2132
01:53:23,923 --> 01:53:25,322
Yeah, it's John.

2133
01:53:25,424 --> 01:53:27,324
I'm hanging in there.
Holly there?

2134
01:53:27,426 --> 01:53:28,791
I'll hold on.

2135
01:53:45,277 --> 01:53:47,370
Zeus, hold up!
Hold up!

2136
01:53:47,479 --> 01:53:48,707
John?

2137
01:53:48,814 --> 01:53:49,872
John?

2138
01:53:49,982 --> 01:53:52,143
John? Goddamn it!

2139
01:54:19,311 --> 01:54:20,869
Yesterday...

2140
01:54:20,980 --> 01:54:24,780
Yesterday we were
an army with no country.

2141
01:54:24,883 --> 01:54:26,646
Tomorrow...

2142
01:54:26,752 --> 01:54:30,153
we have to decide

2143
01:54:30,256 --> 01:54:32,724
which country
we want to buy!

2144
01:54:37,630 --> 01:54:38,688
And remember...

2145
01:54:38,797 --> 01:54:41,163
this is all due

2146
01:54:41,267 --> 01:54:44,168
to the g-g-g-gullibility

2147
01:54:44,270 --> 01:54:47,068
of the New York
Police Department!

2148
01:54:47,172 --> 01:54:48,696
To the police department!

2149
01:54:48,807 --> 01:54:49,865
Yeah!

2150
01:55:02,121 --> 01:55:03,281
Kamerad!

2151
01:55:04,556 --> 01:55:05,648
Kamerad!

2152
01:55:18,103 --> 01:55:19,502
Deitman, take over.

2153
01:55:19,605 --> 01:55:21,402
All right, listen up!

2154
01:55:21,507 --> 01:55:22,906
First squad,
you muster out

2155
01:55:23,008 --> 01:55:26,000
in half an hour
in the school bus!

2156
01:55:26,111 --> 01:55:28,011
You'll be
the lacrosse team!

2157
01:55:38,757 --> 01:55:40,281
No rush.

2158
01:55:40,392 --> 01:55:44,328
Jurgens, you'll be the padre!

2159
01:55:44,430 --> 01:55:46,057
Padre?

2160
01:56:09,788 --> 01:56:11,449
Lights! Douse those lights.

2161
01:56:34,279 --> 01:56:35,746
Hey, dickhead,

2162
01:56:35,848 --> 01:56:38,681
did I come at a bad time?

2163
01:56:41,587 --> 01:56:42,645
Aah!

2164
01:56:44,056 --> 01:56:47,116
Wow! I think she's pissed
at you, McClane.

2165
01:56:56,869 --> 01:56:57,893
Go!

2166
01:56:58,003 --> 01:56:59,368
Go!

2167
01:56:59,471 --> 01:57:00,802
Go!

2168
01:57:08,046 --> 01:57:10,412
He's under us now.
Come back around.

2169
01:57:10,516 --> 01:57:12,177
Zeus, what's on your side?

2170
01:57:12,284 --> 01:57:14,184
Look like roaches
in the lights.

2171
01:57:16,288 --> 01:57:18,688
I'll be going
to Nova Scotia.

2172
01:57:18,791 --> 01:57:20,554
You go with the trucks.

2173
01:57:20,659 --> 01:57:23,059
I have something
personal to finish.

2174
01:57:25,831 --> 01:57:27,230
Let's go to work.

2175
01:57:41,180 --> 01:57:42,579
That's right, run,
motherfuckers!

2176
01:57:42,681 --> 01:57:44,581
The exterminators
are here!

2177
01:57:44,683 --> 01:57:46,048
Whoo!

2178
01:57:56,195 --> 01:57:57,594
What the fuck?

2179
01:57:59,798 --> 01:58:01,698
We got a chopper behind us!

2180
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:03,461
Got a gun on board?

2181
01:58:03,569 --> 01:58:04,797
What is this?

2182
01:58:08,740 --> 01:58:11,538
Hold it still.
I can't see a thing.

2183
01:58:15,447 --> 01:58:16,846
Oh, shit!

2184
01:58:16,949 --> 01:58:18,177
Oh, shit!

2185
01:58:18,283 --> 01:58:20,615
What do you mean,
"Oh, shit"?

2186
01:58:21,720 --> 01:58:24,348
Hang on. Hang on.
We're going down.

2187
01:58:24,456 --> 01:58:25,514
Cease fire!

2188
01:58:25,624 --> 01:58:28,024
Hey, McClane,
what the fuck?

2189
01:58:30,095 --> 01:58:31,494
Hey, we got smoke!

2190
01:58:31,597 --> 01:58:34,998
We got fucking smoke
and shit flying on me!

2191
01:58:36,401 --> 01:58:37,299
Truck! Truck!

2192
01:58:37,402 --> 01:58:38,300
Hold on.

2193
01:58:44,810 --> 01:58:47,210
We got to get
out of here!

2194
01:58:47,312 --> 01:58:49,041
They'll start
shooting any second.

2195
01:58:49,147 --> 01:58:50,045
Oh, shit!

2196
01:58:50,148 --> 01:58:51,547
I can't get it off!

2197
01:58:51,650 --> 01:58:54,244
Look out!
Here he comes!

2198
01:58:56,455 --> 01:58:57,854
Can't get out, McClane.

2199
01:58:57,956 --> 01:58:59,355
Get him out of here.

2200
01:58:59,458 --> 01:59:00,686
Where you going?

2201
01:59:00,792 --> 01:59:02,123
I'll get his attention.

2202
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:22,975
Shit.

2203
01:59:23,081 --> 01:59:24,878
This keeps getting
better and better.

2204
01:59:30,022 --> 01:59:31,421
I had no idea

2205
01:59:31,523 --> 01:59:33,957
Canada could be
this much fun.

2206
01:59:38,230 --> 01:59:41,222
Just give me something
to shoot at.

2207
01:59:41,333 --> 01:59:42,732
Come on, hotshot.

2208
01:59:42,834 --> 01:59:45,132
Show me that smiling face.

2209
02:00:06,491 --> 02:00:08,356
Say hello to your brother.

2210
02:00:10,495 --> 02:00:12,087
Get out of here!

2211
02:00:28,280 --> 02:00:30,578
Yippee-ki-yay,
motherfucker.

2212
02:00:33,719 --> 02:00:36,119
Looks like you got
his attention.

2213
02:00:36,221 --> 02:00:37,813
Yeah, looks like it.

2214
02:00:39,725 --> 02:00:42,125
Think we should call
a fire truck?

2215
02:00:42,227 --> 02:00:43,694
Fuck them.
Let him cook.

2216
02:00:46,431 --> 02:00:47,989
Oh, shit!

2217
02:00:48,100 --> 02:00:49,624
What?

2218
02:00:49,735 --> 02:00:51,100
What?

2219
02:00:51,203 --> 02:00:53,603
I left Holly
hanging on hold.

2220
02:00:53,705 --> 02:00:55,104
Aw, call her back.

2221
02:00:55,207 --> 02:00:56,606
I don't know.

2222
02:00:56,708 --> 02:00:58,733
She's going to be pissed.

2223
02:00:58,877 --> 02:01:00,469
She'll get over it.

2224
02:01:00,579 --> 02:01:03,309
I don't know, Zeus.

2225
02:01:03,415 --> 02:01:04,814
Like I said,

2226
02:01:04,916 --> 02:01:06,816
she's a very stubborn woman.

2227
02:01:06,918 --> 02:01:10,149
She'd have to be
to stay married to you.

2228
02:01:10,255 --> 02:01:12,155
Ha ha ha!
