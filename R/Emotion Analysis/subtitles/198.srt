1
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,600
Hey, how did you manage to leave the cell?

2
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,100
How did you come out of cell? Open door 2.

3
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,100
How did you come out?

4
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,300
Return back to the cell!

5
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,200
I told you to go back to the cell!

6
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,300
Let's give you a few friends to play with.

7
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,100
Sorry.

8
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,600
- Send the guards there!
- Yes, sir!

9
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,200
Okay, I'm set. How is things going down below?

10
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,000
How do you think? I am in a sewer.

11
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,700
Doors do not open. We're stuck here.

12
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,000
Alarm goes off.

13
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,800
- We are in danger! We ask for reinforcements!
- Captain!

14
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,200
Damn!

15
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,700
- We need reinforcements.
- We have a problem in sector 2E.

16
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,300
I'm in position.

17
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,900
Move to phase two.

18
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,400
Wha,what are you doing? What are you doing?

19
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,300
What's wrong? What's happening, Benji?

20
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,000
O God! He is not gonna be in the extraction point.

21
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,300
Stay focus. He knows where he's going.

22
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,400
No,  no, I'm not. No, I wouldn't, I would not open that door, please.

23
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
Go to the  extraction point, Ethan.

24
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,500
I know, I know what this means, but I, I can't. I'm not authorized...

25
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,800
Go to the extraction point, Ethan. Go to the extraction point!

26
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,100
O, we gonna, each we gonna wait,
we gonna wait ,we gonna wait. Right, I can wait.

27
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,600
Okay fine! fine! fine!

28
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,100
There! You just, just screw the
whole thing up, on purposed.

29
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,500
What do you mean nobody works?

30
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,800
ah..Jane, we gonna have a slight delay.

31
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,200
Why do you wanna go in there?

32
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,600
Bogdan.

33
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,440
Bogdan.

34
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,400
- Sergei?
- Come on.

35
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,000
- You mean now?
- Yes, now.

36
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,300
I don't know what he's doing, and for some reasons I'm helping him

37
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,300
As long as he's in his ways should be in the sunk end

38
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,700
ah, we have a passenger.

39
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,700
Sergei!

40
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,600
Open all!

41
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,900
Come on!

42
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,200
God! This is a dead end!

43
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,500
Sergei, do not tell me that this is the end of our escape route.

44
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,000
Go ahead.

45
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
- Agent Hunt?
- And you're?

46
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,100
Agent Carter.

47
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,000
Okay.

48
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,200
- Who's your pal?
- I tell you on the way.

49
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,400
Light the fuse!

50
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:04,900
Mission Impossible 4:  GHOST PROTOCOL

51
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,400
- Sergei, what happens here?
- Everything is fine, Bogdan.

52
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,600
I don't mean to bring up elephant in the room,
but what's the big hairy Russian?

53
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,600
Who, Bogdan?

54
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,100
He said me intel. If I left him there, they would kill him.

55
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,800
So we're gonna give him his freedom.
Did you call these sweepers?

56
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,200
- Yeah, they're on their way
- Good, good.

57
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,800
Benji, how is it you're here?

58
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,700
Oh, I passed a few exam. Crazy, right?

59
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,100
Yeah, it's crazy.

60
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,600
- DNA test.
- It's me.

61
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,500
It's procedure. I'm just confirming it's you.

62
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,300
You're very thorough.

63
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,100
Sergei, are you not Russian?

64
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,700
- Yes perhaps.
- Sweeps are approaching, brooms are edged.

65
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,900
- Roger that.

66
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:20,500
Sergei, are you not Sergei?

67
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,800
You'll be fine. Bogdan ...

68
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,100
- I always take care of my friends.
- My friend ...

69
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,700
- Messy bringing him along?
- I thought it went rather well.

70
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,900
You want telling me what are you doing in Russian prison?

71
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,400
Wanna tell me why you brought me up?

72
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,200
This wasn't a rescue mission?

73
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,000
Let me put it this way...

74
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,900
If The Secretary wanted me out of there,

75
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,400
must be pretty bad out here.

76
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,400
We were after a file. We lost it.

77
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,200
We? Who lost it, you?

78
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,600
- Agent Hanaway.
- Where is Hanaway?

79
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,600
It was a little drop

80
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,900
... classified file.

81
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,600
It should've been a simple intercept.

82
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,700
They knew, which train the courier was on.

83
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,600
ETA 2 minutes on the courier.

84
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,600
- But there is one thing we didn't know.
- Wild Cat.

85
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,600
your train six minutes at.

86
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,900
Who the courier was.

87
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,500
Now or never, Bob Cap.

88
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,600
Hurry! Who's delivering the file, what's his name?

89
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,600
- Go ahead, shoot.
- We're out of time.

90
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,400
I need a name, folks.
You can't track all these people at once.

91
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,800
Aargh, Marek..Stefanski. For the love of God..

92
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,800
- You got it?
- Marek Stefanski.

93
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,000
Searching...

94
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,200
I'll take it from here.

95
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,300
Are you allright, buddy?

96
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,500
Hanaway dropped Marek, and grab his bag.

97
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,300
Sit down. Get your breath.

98
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,400
He had the file in his in hands. Easy in easy out.

99
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,900
file's secured.

100
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,000
But we weren't the only ones after it.

101
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,100
Bob Cap, someone else is scratched this party.

102
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,400
I'm not alone.

103
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,100
- Local police?
- No. Armed hostils.

104
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,200
Maintain, I'm coming. I will get him backing up.

105
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,900
Negative, Operator. Broad the route
southwest corner, 60 seconds.

106
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,900
Hanaway's lens came to a facial matched...
and triggered a warning.

107
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,000
But it was too late.

108
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:55,650
No!

109
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,300
You're gonna be okay.

110
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,900
You're so beautiful.

111
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,300
I should've told you..

112
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,700
It was my op.

113
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,100
I put him in the field.

114
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,300
And she left him just alive
enough for me to see him die.

115
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,600
I'm sorry.

116
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:52,700
- You know her?
- Sabine Moreau. Contract killer.

117
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,100
Works for diamonds.

118
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,800
Who is in the file?

119
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,400
Russian nuclear launch codes.

120
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,800
IMF's been looking for emerging
extremist, codenamed Cobalt .

121
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,100
He's determined to detonate a
nuclear weapon however he can.

122
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,200
We know Moreau works for him before.

123
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,300
What else did IMF know about him?

124
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,300
As much as you do now.

125
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,200
But if Moreau has nuclear launch codes,

126
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:37,200
you can bet Cobalt's confirmed person of
interest to enemy number one .

127
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,700
We're here.

128
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:05,600
- Agent confirmed.
- Why was he in prison?

129
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,400
He disobeyed. After he and his wife ... you know.

130
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,700
I thought he just been transferred. Or on leave.

131
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,700
There were rumours then...

132
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,500
to work on the unsanctioned hit.

133
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,200
Welcome back, Mr. Hunt.

134
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,500
In your absence, IMF has
learnt that Cobalt is, or was,

135
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,700
a level one nuclear strategist
for Russian Intelligent.

136
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,800
Therefore, the only way to
uncover his actual identity

137
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,700
is to infiltrate the Kremlin itself.

138
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,200
In order to get passed their checkpoints,

139
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,300
you'll be impersonating General Anatoly Fedorov.

140
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:42,200
We believe Cobalt will do everything he can
to destroy any record of his identity.

141
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,800
Your mission, should you choose to accept it,

142
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,000
is to penetrate the highly secured
archive inside the Kremlin.

143
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,600
And retrieve Cobalt's file,
before he can destroy it.

144
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,800
New intel suggests Cobalt is already in route,

145
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,100
leaving you... 4 hours 52 minutes

146
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,600
to infiltrate.

147
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,400
To save time, we've chosen your team for you.

148
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,400
Agent Carter and Dunn.

149
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:10,300
As always, should you or any member
of your team, be caught or killed.

150
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,100
The Secretary will disavow any
knowledge of your actions.

151
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:17,100
This message will self-destruct in 5 seconds.
Good luck, Ethan.

152
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,600
What do you got?

153
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,500
We're going into the Kremlin.

154
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,000
I thought you said "the Kremlin".

155
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,700
I thought you said "the Kremlin".

156
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,400
Okay.

157
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,900
This is very exciting.

158
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,600
Being on the field ... with you, you know.

159
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,800
It's a bit of a dream ... for me.

160
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,500
I love your disguise by the way.
You look just like him.

161
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,600
It's a shame would wear a masks.
You know like a full masks.

162
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,100
Everybody get to wear a mask, but Benji.

163
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,100
Sorry. I'm dead. I babbled when I am nervous.

164
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,600
When doing it again, shut up it.

165
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,800
Okay, settle secure to go,
that's x-ray machines, cameras...

166
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,600
metal detectors. Just what we expected.

167
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,300
We can do this.

168
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:36,000
Releasing in three, two, one.

169
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,100
Going fast, going fast, Kremlin going fast.

170
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,800
Mr. General.

171
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,600
I am Major Yegorov.
Show me the documents, please.

172
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:06,000
Don't you think I am?

173
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,400
It's not found.

174
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,900
Try it again, Major ... ... Yegorov.

175
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,200
Excuse me, General. I did not recognize.

176
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,900
You should be kicked out, Major Yegorov.

177
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,900
I think might not going well.

178
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,000
- Relax.
- Sorry.

179
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,600
I'm sorry, by the way ...

180
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,800
About you and Julia.

181
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,400
You know ... not working if i may ...

182
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:51,200
I wanted to say something before
you ran away but I,..I liked it.

183
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,400
here, he's off the phone now.

184
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,600
It's empty. The disks are empty.

185
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,200
Check in, team leader.

186
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,000
Over. Repeat, check in, team leader.

187
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,800
Have you made it to the archive room?

188
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,900
Captain, one is in the archive!

189
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,400
Someone is pickybacking our frequency.

190
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:09,600
Team leader, awaiting your go sign.
Standing by to detonate.

191
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,620
Abort!

192
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,400
Rendezvous nod 2.

193
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,800
What is it?

194
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,100
Close the gate!

195
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,100
Immediately!

196
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,100
Our media is no more thruthful than yours ...

197
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,900
...American.

198
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:41,700
But we both know, that there'll
cause of the explosion was you.

199
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:52,200
Awaiting your go sign, Team leader.
Standing by to detonate.

200
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,100
The worst part for you, team leader...

201
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:03,400
is I'm the man assigned to make you suffer for it,
for what you did to my country.

202
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:10,800
This is clinic, not a bar.
Stop looking at me.

203
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,100
Misha, help me with him. Quick!

204
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,000
I think you're proud to have survived.

205
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,100
I have a few questions I would ask them.

206
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,400
Watch where you walk!

207
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,100
- Go and get my car.
- Okay.

208
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,100
Look there!

209
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,000
Not a good idea.

210
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,500
Seem like one ... a minute ago.

211
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,300
What are you doing? Damn!

212
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,700
I can not believe it.

213
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,200
All units, we have a fugitive.
He took her to the west.

214
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,700
Insolidated insurance. How may I help you?

215
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,500
Search 20. Agent A2 delta echo
requesting immediate "evac".

216
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,900
Rendezvous Alpha 1-1-3.

217
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:14,800
Confirmed. Alpha 1-1-3.

218
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Anna, Anna, Anna.

219
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,900
I told myself ...

220
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,500
We should leave town for a couple of days.

221
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,600
Alex, you, me. Vacation.

222
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,100
- Now?
- Tonight.

223
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,000
Who we will go, father?

224
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,800
just, just the three of us.

225
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,300
Where will we go?

226
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,040
Leonid?

227
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,600
(news) ...has been transported to
anear hospital for treatment.

228
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,600
While Russian Officials continue to blame

229
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,800
a gas main break.

230
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,000
Experts has citing the shape of the blast area,

231
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,700
and the size of debris field is more consistent with

232
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,500
anonymous sand explosive.

233
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:47,600
Any speculations may have been
an undeclared act of aggression.

234
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:51,600
Although the Defence Ministry is maintaining
that this is strictly an accident...

235
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,600
Anna, pack a bag for Alex.

236
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,200
We're leaving now.

237
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,450
Anna.

238
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,500
Anna.

239
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,700
We have work to do.

240
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,900
Mr. Secretary.

241
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,400
There's in no way you're in Russia.

242
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,300
I'm not. Not since a bomb blew up the Kremlin.

243
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:06,100
Yesterday I flew in to accept the order of
friendship from Russian Prime Minister.

244
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:09,000
Now I'm headed back to Washington,

245
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,900
to hand the President my resignation.

246
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,400
My chief analyst, William Brandt.

247
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,300
- A pen
- Pardon me? - A pen.

248
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,300
Here.

249
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,000
Ethan, what happened in the Kremlin?

250
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,000
Chief analyst you say?

251
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,500
- I'm implying that I made about a call ...
- Europian male.

252
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,500
Fifties, about 6 foots,
180 pounds, blue eyes. Who is he?

253
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,500
Crude drawing, but by your description..

254
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,700
... that could be Kurt Hendricks.

255
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:47,600
190 IQ, served in Swedish Special Forces.

256
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,900
Professor of Physics, Stockholm University

257
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:52,200
Specialist in nuclear and game theory.

258
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,400
Asked to resign ...

259
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,000
... Well, because he's crazy.

260
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,840
Cobalt.

261
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,200
You have to allert the Kremlin
that one of their strategist

262
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,800
has a nuclear launch device.

263
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,200
And what if his operative has the code activated

264
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,600
What makes you say that?

265
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,500
I saw him.

266
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:16,200
Leaving the executive armory bag in hand,

267
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,500
he set off that explosion to cover his tracks.

268
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,800
It maybe weeks before the
Russians know it's missing.

269
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,500
- Unless we tell them.
- They won't listen to us.

270
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:28,200
As far as the Russian has concerned,
we just bombed the Kremlin.

271
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,700
Tension between United States
and Russia, hasn't been this high

272
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,300
since the Cuban Missile Crisis.

273
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:38,300
And the blame, right or wrong, points to IMF.

274
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:47,100
President has innitiated Ghost Protocol.

275
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:51,400
The entire IMF has been disavowed.

276
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,300
So what's happened now?

277
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:58,800
Now I've been ordered to take
you back to Washington.

278
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,100
Where D.O.D  will labelled you as rough extremist,

279
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:05,400
and hang the Kremlin bombing
on you and your team.

280
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,500
Unless ...

281
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:12,600
... you were to escape somewhere
between here and the airport

282
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:16,500
airing on assaulted Mr. Brandt and me.

283
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,100
Sir?

284
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:23,200
You will then illegally scrounge
whatever material you could from backup supply cash..

285
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,000
that I've overlooked the same cash..

286
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,700
- ..for your team awaiting for further orders.
- Sir, you may wanna read ...

287
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,600
You will then disappeared.

288
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,600
And this conversation never having taken place..

289
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,900
but your intention would be unclear.

290
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:40,300
But if anyone of your team is caught or killed,

291
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,500
they will be branded terrorists,

292
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:47,100
out to incite a global nuclear war.

293
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,000
Your mission.

294
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,600
Should you choose to accept it.

295
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,500
Ethan, you're my best man.

296
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,900
And I'm sorry it's come to this,

297
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,800
after all the sacrifices you've made.

298
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:15,300
We don't meet again, I just want you to know ...

299
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,600
I will always consider you a friend ...

300
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,900
Stay down. Drive, drive, drive!

301
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,600
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

302
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,300
Take deep breaths, stay with me.

303
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,300
- ready?
- yes

304
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,400
What do we do?

305
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,400
Wait here.

306
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,100
Where else to might I go?

307
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,800
Hey! hey, hey, hey.. There!

308
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,800
Stop! Hold your fire!

309
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:05,300
Hold your fire!

310
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,800
Enough!

311
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:10,100
Perhaps more are still alive.

312
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,900
Today, in a nearby prison two inmates escaped.

313
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:45,700
Who is this? What we know about him?

314
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,500
Why would that work?

315
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,900
- Why what work?
- The flare on the body.

316
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,100
- What watt were they work?
- They did work.

317
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:00,600
- Yeah, I know that...
- Hey! - But why?

318
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,500
- I mean, how did you know that
would draw their fire? - I didn't.

319
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,700
I played a hunch.

320
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:10,700
okay?
All right. What was your scenario?

321
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:13,800
Right, there was a guy being shot at the water.

322
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,300
All the sudden, such a light
out of a flare, turn around?

323
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,300
I mean, what you assume maybe thinking

324
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:23,200
- thinking?
- yeah.

325
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,200
I didn't assume they were thinking.

326
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,300
I assumed they were shooting at anything to move

327
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,700
and that just give them a target. But these ...

328
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,700
These guys are not schollars, you know?

329
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:40,600
- This is really happening, isn't it?
- Yeah.

330
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:45,000
- Okay. You know what that sound is?
- It's our ride out of here.

331
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,500
Our ride's green car, with 47.

332
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,500
I see three.

333
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Okay, Let's do it! go, go, go, go!

334
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:02,100
- All right. Forty-seven.
- I don't see it. - Forty seven.

335
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,300
Oh shit!

336
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,900
This is it. Where's the pass?

337
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,800
Enter your code.

338
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:23,100
Press ENTER.

339
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,700
Retinal scanner.

340
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:32,100
Retinal scan required.

341
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:34,100
Watch out.

342
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,400
Retinal scan required.

343
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,000
Agent confirmed.

344
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:54,300
Ethan?
Geez, I thought you were died.

345
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,300
- We are.
- Who's this?

346
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:59,900
Agent. Dunn and Carter.
William Brandt, chief analyst.

347
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,000
Analyst.

348
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,300
Agent confirmed.

349
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,500
Power of the world finally end.

350
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,900
It is my job to predict the unthinkable.

351
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:27,100
To treat the death of billions as a game.

352
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:31,500
After 20 years of this, I was none.

353
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:35,400
Until a new question crossed my mind.

354
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
What happens after the end of the world?

355
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,800
Are you sure your line is secure?

356
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,000
Every 2 or 3 million years ...

357
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,700
Are you certain your line is secure?

358
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:49,900
... some natural catastrophy
devastates all life on earth.

359
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:52,100
But life goes on.

360
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:55,700
And what little remain is made stronger.

361
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:59,600
Put simply world destruction, isn't unpleasant..

362
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:02,700
..but necessary part of evolution.

363
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:07,100
What happens then, I wondered.

364
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:10,100
When mankind faces the next end of the world.

365
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:12,800
I don't care what you have to do,
to get him to Dubai.

366
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,500
I'll make you worse as well. Just do it.

367
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:19,300
- I look to Hiroshima, Nagasaki.
- Well, I'll be waiting for your call.

368
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:22,100
Thriving cities, rebuilt from the ashes.

369
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:24,400
Monuments to unimaginable

370
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,100
dedicated to the concept of peace.

371
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:30,000
It's occured to me here, that nuclear war..

372
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,800
might have a place in the natural order.

373
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,700
But only if it could be controlled.

374
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:40,200
Only if attached every living song equally.

375
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:45,900
IMF and I believe this man, Kurt
Hendricks, is a nuclear extremist.

376
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,800
Codename, Cobalt.

377
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,300
Today he was seen leaving the
Kremlin, that would most likely

378
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:51,300
a nuclear launch device.

379
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:57,600
A few days ago, Sabine Moreau killed
one of our agents in Budapest.

380
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:00,300
We believe him off Russian nuclear launch code.

381
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:04,900
Intel indicates she would check in the
Burj Hotel in Dubai in 36 hours.

382
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,600
Mariusz Wistrom is known operative of Cobalt.

383
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:11,200
Wistrom is currently on route to Dubai.

384
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,900
For the launch device to work,
Cobalt needs the activation codes.

385
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:18,200
He's sending Wistrom, to buy them from Moreau.

386
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,000
The Secretary is dead.

387
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:31,200
The President has invoked Ghost Protocol.

388
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:33,600
We're shut down.

389
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:37,500
No satellites, safehouse, support or extraction.

390
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,000
The four of us ...

391
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:43,900
... and the content of this car
are all that remain of the IMF.

392
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:45,900
And as if this moment any actions are unsanctioned.

393
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:49,800
So if you want out, speak now.

394
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,500
Our mission is Hendricks.

395
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,900
We're all  distance between him and his goal,
nothing can be left to chance.

396
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:14,300
Everyone connected with this man is considered an asset

397
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,100
with valuable information about our target.

398
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:17,700
No one can know we're still online.

399
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:20,300
We lose Hendricks now, we lose him forever.

400
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:21,800
So, what's the plan?

401
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:24,400
Wistrom  will take delivery from Moreau in 36 hours.

402
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,800
Now we can not let the launch codes leave the hotel.

403
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,900
But we need Wistrom to lead us to Hendricks.

404
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:32,200
Yeah, we only do that if he has the codes

405
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,500
- Or if he thinks he has it.
- Objective. ..

406
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,200
... is to intercept the sale.

407
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,100
Place the authentic codes with counterfeits.

408
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:41,300
- and follow Wistrom to Hendricks.
- Well, that's, that's simple enough.

409
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,600
We just, we snatch the codes,
we generate some fakes.

410
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:47,000
Jane, you double Moreau
and sell the codes to Wistrom.

411
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,200
And bob your ankle.

412
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:52,100
And how do you propose, that we just
snatch the code from Moreau?

413
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:54,100
You take her out.

414
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:58,300
Yeah, we take her out,but you know, discreetly.

415
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:00,800
- Discreetly?
- Yeah.

416
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,900
- Right, she's an asset.
- Right.

417
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,700
I get it. Sorry. Nothing left to chance, he said.

418
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:08,200
I'm just, I'm a spit bowling.
You know, it's not all gonna be go.

419
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:11,600
- We don't touch Wistrom.. .
- All right. -..or Moreau.

420
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:16,400
As you asked for Hanaway,
but it has to be when I say.

421
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,000
After we had Hendricks.

422
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,900
- Only pack what we need.
- Yeah absolutely.

423
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:27,900
Only pack what we need. You never know.

424
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,050
DUBAI

425
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,900
So even if we can double Wistrom and Moreau,

426
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:01,400
How do we keep them in separate rooms,

427
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,800
Or having they think they are in the same room?

428
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:06,100
We give the hotel a facelift.

429
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,800
Wistrom will think he's arriving at Moreau's suite.

430
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,500
But really, he will be walking into our decoy room.

431
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,100
Where I'll double Moreau.

432
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:15,100
Downstairs Benji will double Wistrom...

433
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:17,600
- a masks!
- And meet with real Moreau.

434
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:21,200
And eh, huh, What am I doing?

435
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,500
You? You're the helper.

436
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,700
Help ... okay.

437
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:33,300
So, to the extent understand
what are you talking about here  ...

438
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,800
uhm, Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world.

439
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:39,300
And you want to alter its infrastructure,

440
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:41,300
with the hopes of convincing two people that

441
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:45,400
they had a meeting, which actually
really never happened ...

442
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,120
Right?

443
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:58,000
Camels.

444
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,500
ETA on dry cleaning.

445
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,900
I'm on my way out.

446
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,800
Okay, 34 minutes to doorknock.

447
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,600
wow,.. ehm, okay. this, this is a slight wrinkle,..
nothing, nothing to worry about.

448
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:08,300
We're just gonna have to go into
server room, from the outside.

449
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:14,300
- What? - Well, the firewalls in this
building serve a  military grade.

450
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:17,300
I mean, this would be a synched if I
could call Yusuf back at headquarter,

451
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:19,800
but Yusuf doen't exist anymore,
and neither do we.

452
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,400
I could hack it, but it would take too long.

453
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,500
Their hardware in.

454
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:25,300
And there's four layers of an exchange
security because not in server-in.

455
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:27,700
and there is no way we can get into it from inside.

456
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:32,700
If we can't get through the server, we don't
control the elevators, we don't control security cameras.

457
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:34,900
This operation is over even before it begins.

458
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:36,900
I'm telling you we can get to it from outside.

459
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:37,650
We?

460
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:41,500
I'm,  I'm on the computer.

461
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,200
I'm just a ... the helper.

462
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:52,100
- What floor is it now?
- 130.

463
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:53,950
130 ?

464
00:54:58,300 --> 00:54:59,500
- Vent out?
- pressure's unstiff.

465
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:00,500
don't have enough time.

466
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:01,900
- Elevator shaft.
- infrared sensors.

467
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:02,900
don't have enough time.

468
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,500
How am I suppose to do this?

469
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:16,900
Dammit!

470
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,800
Oh, that's high.

471
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:30,600
Okay, now remember, it's a rolling off
motion, that disengages the bond.

472
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,800
When the emitter is blue, that's full adhesion.

473
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,800
Easy way to remember. "Blue is glue."

474
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,800
- And when it's red?
- Dead.

475
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,500
ah, here's your cutter, okay?
And your server interface.

476
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:40,700
Both going back here.

477
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:42,300
One, two.

478
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:45,000
Okay Ethan, holds-all service, 11 stories up

479
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,300
and 7 units over.

480
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:47,700
Okay?

481
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
- Com check?
- Yeah, copy.

482
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,600
So ...

483
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:01,000
It's 26 minutes to doorknock.

484
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:17,700
Yeah ...

485
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:00,100
25 minutes to doorknock.

486
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:17,100
What the hell is that?

487
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:34,300
Hell, what the hell is that?

488
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:37,900
It's a sandstorm.

489
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:42,000
It's a long way off, Ethan.
There's shouldn't be a problem.

490
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:47,400
24 minutes to doorknock.

491
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,500
Where is Ethan?

492
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,800
You gotta be kidding me.

493
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:48,700
23 minutes to doorknock.

494
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,300
I'm in the server level.

495
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:34,300
23 minutes to doorknock.

496
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:37,400
Your countdown is not helping.

497
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,900
I'm just saying.

498
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,200
- I'm in.
- That's great, Ethan. You're half way home.

499
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,900
Located server.

500
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:30,600
Please tell me we're online.

501
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,700
All right, we're live.

502
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:34,600
Okay, now I have control of the elevators.

503
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:37,300
- And the security cameras.
- Time to evacuate.

504
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:40,200
Okay. You drive, and look out for
Wistrom and Moreau.

505
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:58,300
Moreau is at the elevator. It has resceduled.

506
01:00:58,600 --> 01:00:59,350
Go.

507
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:08,500
- We can't open this door, can  we?
- That door? No.

508
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:11,000
Ethan you gotta get down here now.

509
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:14,600
Ethan. Ethan. Is there a problem?

510
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,000
Ethan?

511
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:26,000
- We're not gonna make it.
- We have to make it.

512
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,600
Where is Ethan?

513
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:53,900
- Your line is not long enough!
- No, shit!

514
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:44,200
That was not easy, but I, I did it.

515
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,100
What I missed?

516
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,500
The lense might be a little uncomfortable.

517
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:02,000
It captures images and transmits them
to the printer in the briefcase.

518
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,300
- All right?
- hmm...

519
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:06,700
I can't see, one eye right of it, fine.

520
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:08,900
Blinks twice to activate the shutter.

521
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:12,800
Notice, the numbers are in order.

522
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,900
A perfect copy.

523
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,900
But the numbers are scrambled.

524
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:24,900
Masks? ah, 60 seconds.
Are you sure that I shouldn't wear a mask?

525
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:27,200
You know, cause I'm not exactly Omar Sharif.

526
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,600
I'll play a french. This is you tracking device.

527
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,400
- This is what you're tracking.
- paper clip?

528
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,100
No, it's a paper. It's in the briefcase.

529
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:35,200
It's caught to be isotops, which should give a unique  ...

530
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,600
- It just means that you can track documents,
even if they switch briefcases. - Range?

531
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:40,100
- Not that good, like a half a mile (800 meters).

532
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:42,300
Safest thing to do not let Wistrom out of your sight.

533
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:44,000
Is that Wistrom?

534
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:49,400
Who's out with him?

535
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,900
- I don't know. - We don't have an uplink,
so there's no facial recognition.

536
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:54,300
Who's out with him?

537
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:57,300
That's Leonid Lisenker. Polish phone cryptographer.

538
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:00,600
He redesigned Russia's nuclear security at the Cold War.

539
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:02,900
He set off to authenticate the launch codes.

540
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:04,600
- yeah shit, we are blown.
- No, no, no.

541
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:07,400
Well, we'll would be as soon as he sees
the counterfeit launch codes.

542
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:09,800
- We're not alone.
- He's in the elevator.

543
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:12,000
Delay it.

544
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:22,500
Benji, how long would take it reprogram the case?

545
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:24,500
Ah, a couple seconds. Wow, What for that?

546
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:27,500
- To make an exact copy of the launch codes.
- What?!

547
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,600
- You can't do that.
- Wistrom's on 22.

548
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:31,900
- Slow him down.
- I do what I can.

549
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:37,000
wait, wait, Ethan! Hey! Hang on now, hang on, just a second!

550
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,600
You, you're talking about handing over
active nuclear launch code to Wistrom?

551
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:43,300
- the case, reprogram the case.
- Listen, listen, stop! Listen, listen.

552
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:46,000
You're saying you're fixating, you're thinking clearly.

553
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,900
Listen, that's not gonna happened!

554
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:50,200
- I won't allow it.
- 33, and climbing.

555
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:53,600
Brandt, use your head. The mission is not
the code, the mission is Hendricks.

556
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:55,800
And this little play out, give him back codes neutralize it.

557
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,800
You know that won't do it. Failure to a terrorist...

558
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,800
...just a rehearsal for success.

559
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:01,100
41!

560
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:03,500
We lose Hendricks today, he shows
up somewhere else tomorrow.

561
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:06,200
He finds another way. With no IMF to stop him.

562
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:08,500
Now, it's now or never. Now hand me the case.

563
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,700
Nothing left to chance. You said that !

564
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:12,400
You're the analyst. Now tell me..

565
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,000
..there's another way for
Hendricks to get those codes. - 50!

566
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,800
You tell me that this is only happened
right here, right now. Today!

567
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:19,600
You tell me that, I'll walk away.

568
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,500
- We go without!
- Without masks?

569
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:31,100
- Changes to go.
- Ethan!

570
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:33,800
- We have no choice.
- Ethan, you will be walking on Moreau unarmed.

571
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:36,600
- Face first. Literally.
- How do we know they've met?

572
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:38,400
- How do we know they haven't?
- It doesn't matter!

573
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:42,400
Damn! We have no choice.

574
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,500
Goggles.

575
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,700
What if they have met?

576
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:43,800
Come in.

577
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:21,000
Which of one you is Wistrom?

578
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:24,000
Which one of you is Wistrom?

579
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:27,800
I am.

580
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:31,200
I admire your work.

581
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Sit.

582
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,200
Where are my codes?

583
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,900
Where are my diamonds?

584
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,700
close by.

585
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:07,500
- You have my payment?
- When I see the codes.

586
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,700
Not to worry. Come in!

587
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,700
I thought we could have tea.

588
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,600
Madam moiselle.

589
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:20,000
Misseur.

590
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,600
No diamonds, no codes.

591
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:25,800
No codes, no diamonds.

592
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:32,100
- Kill this one!
- We didn't came alone.

593
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:34,400
That hole I lay out there is killbox.

594
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:37,200
- You know who we work for.
- We come back for its codes,

595
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,700
or we don't come back.

596
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:43,200
- How good is your backup ?
- The best.

597
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:48,900
Kill them the best.

598
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:52,300
Do you care for some sugar?

599
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:57,700
Enough. Let's get this done.

600
01:08:57,700 --> 01:09:00,700
You want payment? I want guarantees.

601
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:04,100
When he's authenticated the codes, I'll
make a call and get your diamonds.

602
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:06,900
That, or ...

603
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:09,400
We alll go home in buckets.

604
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:12,900
Nobody leaves this hotel alive.

605
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:19,000
Get the papers .

606
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,300
- Is there a problem?
- It's locked.

607
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:42,200
Ah, forgive me.

608
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:45,600
There must be a key. For momento.

609
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:51,600
Misseur.

610
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:47,800
My mistake. It is a combination. Not a key.

611
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:51,200
You tell me the numbers!

612
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:57,500
We're good.

613
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:58,500
Zero

614
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:00,900
zero

615
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,700
zero

616
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:23,100
Come on, come on, come on, came on, came on.

617
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:08,100
It was a pleasure doing business with ...

618
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:10,500
Wistrom has launch codes and he's on the move.

619
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:13,500
Hey, I did what you asked, I did!

620
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:16,400
- Now let my family go.
- Release Leonid's family.

621
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:19,600
- Thank God!
- You can thank me in person.

622
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:37,300
It was a pleasure doing business with you.

623
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:46,200
Kill him!

624
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:55,800
Moreau's on the move!

625
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:58,100
I've got her.

626
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,900
Jane, she's an asset.

627
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:03,500
I need her alive.

628
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:06,500
Acknowledge!

629
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:09,000
Acknowledge!

630
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:23,700
Ah, Ethan, Wistrom is in the elevator.
I can't see Leonid there.

631
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:27,800
Benji, slow it down. Give me an elevator.

632
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,500
I'll handle it.

633
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:58,000
Benji, I got a lot call of Wistrom,
but I can't tell. Is he still in the elevator?

634
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:01,500
- Wistrom ... elevator ...
- Benji?

635
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,500
- Ethan, over!
- Benji. Benji, I lost.

636
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:11,600
Ethan, can you hear me?
Ethan, can you hear me? over!

637
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:14,600
Geez!

638
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,900
- Watch her!
- Why, why me?

639
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:27,600
If I'd do it, I'll kill her.

640
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:02,100
Hold it, Team Leader.
Do you really think I wouldn't catch up of you?

641
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:04,000
You and I are not enemies. It was a setup.

642
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:08,100
We'll find out your lies soon enough. Move it!

643
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:12,500
I'm sorry about this.

644
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:34,900
Leonid!

645
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:36,800
- Benji?
- Cover Benji!

646
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:39,000
I've got Leonid by the elevator, he's been shot.

647
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,600
What?

648
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:53,500
Hey, hey, stay with me, stay with me!

649
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:14,400
"No, no no no no no no no no no...

650
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,900
Jane, don't!

651
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:20,700
Now what happened with Moreau, Jane?

652
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:23,500
- She couldn't help us with...
- Yeah, so let's throw her off the building?

653
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:25,600
- I didn't throw her!
- That's throw her off the building!

654
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:28,200
She was not the mission, Jane.

655
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:31,800
The mission was to track the file back to Hendricks.

656
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:35,100
Whose in the wind ...

657
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:59,400
Better have good news for me. Is he here?

658
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:04,300
I got it. Talk to you later. I'll be there.

659
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:07,600
But no one will be following me.
Just make sure no one's following you.

660
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:10,400
- And how the hell that the Russians find us?
- Why do you ask me for?

661
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:13,100
Because you are in communication.
You in charge covering our tracks.

662
01:23:13,100 --> 01:23:16,200
We can not afford to make
mistakes like that now, Benji.

663
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:18,600
You are  not a technician anymore.
You're field agent.

664
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:20,700
And you're just an analyst?!

665
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:24,100
Right? Right?

666
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:28,700
Who are you really, Brandt?

667
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:31,100
- What do you ask me?
- What am I asking?

668
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:32,900
Let me see if I can put in another ...

669
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:44,700
How does an agent whose skills like that,
end up an analyst?

670
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:55,100
What if we all have secrets?

671
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:58,800
tell me, Ethan.

672
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:05,600
You tell me yours, I tell you mine.

673
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,100
I'm all clear.

674
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:28,600
I have friends in the region. Just sit tight.
I'll send someone to get you out of here.

675
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:30,700
What about Hendricks? What's the plan?

676
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:33,700
The plan was first to stop him together.

677
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:37,000
- And what would you gonna do?
- Change the plan.

678
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,100
Wait, that's it?

679
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:41,600
What we gonna do? go after him alone?

680
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:46,100
You can explain yourself, agent Brandt?

681
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:53,200
I was in a protection detail in Croatia.

682
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:56,800
Shadowing the assets, husband and wife.

683
01:25:57,800 --> 01:26:01,700
We were never suppose to know we were there.
Whole things routines as in no crap.

684
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:11,200
Three years in,we caught wind that this
Serbian hit squad was after our couple.

685
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:15,300
But my team had it under control,
I knew that they would coming.

686
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:21,000
But I couldn't shake this feeling that
I should warn the couple somehow.

687
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:24,100
I wanted to..  find the way to let them know

688
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:28,800
But you know, orders are oders, so I didn't.

689
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:37,900
One day, the husband decides to leave
the hotel and go for a run.

690
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:39,500
So I followed him.

691
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:42,800
And leave two men with the wife.

692
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:45,800
When I get back,

693
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:48,700
my guys were unconscious and the wife is gone.

694
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,500
Local police found her body three days later.

695
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:56,300
What was left over anyway.

696
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:04,000
It was my last day on the field.

697
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:08,200
I couldn't face another life or death situations after that.

698
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:10,000
So, what happened with her husband?

699
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Never saw him again.

700
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:18,400
Until two days ago, in Moscow, when the
Secretary introduced me to Ethan Hunt.

701
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,400
No, that's not what happened.
She left him, you know.

702
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:28,400
I heard that one too, Benji.

703
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:32,200
But, unfortunately, I was there.

704
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:36,700
Just like I was there when the
Secretary got the phone call..

705
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:41,300
..that Ethan was in custody for killing 6
Serbian nationals  in cold blood.

706
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:43,500
- ah, I'm sorry, shouldn't hit?
- Yeah.

707
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:46,500
Disavowed.

708
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:58,400
Last thing I know ... I am on the plane to Dubai.

709
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:03,600
Wondering the old time ... Do I tell him?

710
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:08,300
How do I tell him?

711
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:12,000
That I'm responsible.

712
01:28:13,700 --> 01:28:16,900
I could've warned him. I should've warned him.

713
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:21,700
But I didn't.

714
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:25,000
And she died.

715
01:28:30,700 --> 01:28:34,300
Sergei! Sergei, my friend!

716
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:37,300
I told you, I was gathered here. Didn't I say?

717
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:39,500
- I don't know it's him?
- Yes, it's him.

718
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:41,800
You trust me, I trust you, right?

719
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:46,900
This is the guy! This is the guy,
the one I told you about.

720
01:28:46,900 --> 01:28:49,800
So, we can take these things off.

721
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:57,500
Sorry, he's a great guy, but he doesn't
know you like I do, you understand.

722
01:28:57,500 --> 01:29:00,500
So, you work for American government?

723
01:29:01,700 --> 01:29:05,600
- And you are an arm stealer.
- No, no! Sergei, Sergei!

724
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:10,400
He's independent defense coordinator, right?

725
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:13,500
That's right, very classic job.

726
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:16,200
- Listen, he's a friend.
- Those diamonds are for Bogdan.

727
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:18,100
No, no, it's okay. He can have it.

728
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:21,900
Whatever arrangements you made with my
cousin, it's between you and him.

729
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:24,700
You want something from me, you pay.

730
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:27,600
You misunderstand. I am not buying.

731
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,500
I'm selling.

732
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:31,700
You selling?

733
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:34,800
- Selling what?
- The future.

734
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:37,400
Yeah, I got all I need, thank you.

735
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:39,900
Our countries are on the break of war.

736
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:42,200
War is very good for business.

737
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:44,900
Nuclear war?

738
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:55,300
Go on.

739
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:58,500
I'm looking for a man named Kurt Hendricks.
You may know him as Cobalt.

740
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:01,400
In this case, I think you know what he wants.

741
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:04,700
I bet he even try to buy it from you at some point.

742
01:30:05,700 --> 01:30:09,200
- Go on.
- He has a case, he has codes.

743
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:12,600
But they're worthless without tactical satellite.

744
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:16,000
I want to know where he get it.

745
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,900
A man with information like that
would be a potential terrorist.

746
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:27,000
And to your government,
a potential terrorist is a terrorist.

747
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:32,000
Do you help me?

748
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,900
My friends become your friends.

749
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,900
Sorry. I can not help you.

750
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:52,100
I certainly can not tell you that, Russia quitely
sold an obselete technical satellite...

751
01:30:52,100 --> 01:30:55,600
to a certain telecom in Mumbai.

752
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:59,500
And who ever gave them that idea?

753
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:02,500
An enterprising third party.

754
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:04,000
Working on commission.

755
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,800
Helping old friends, making new ones.

756
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:11,400
- Can the satellite be shut down?
- That would take a special skills then.

757
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:14,600
You can not do it alone.

758
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:42,700
- What's in the bags?
- It's our gear.

759
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:46,500
- How'd you get it?
- Made a friend.

760
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:50,100
- I'm glad we could help.
- You can help now.

761
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,600
- Look Ethan, before...
- Whatever happened, happened.

762
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:59,100
We still have a chance to clean this up.
But we have to do it now, we have to do it together.

763
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:08,400
Yeah sure, where are we going?

764
01:32:09,300 --> 01:32:10,020
India.

765
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:17,500
- India? India?
- Yeah, sure. - Okay.

766
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:23,200
Love the jet!

767
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:25,700
Where do you see the car?

768
01:32:31,900 --> 01:32:34,500
- Sidorov.
- (in Russian) What are you doing, man?

769
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:36,500
You were ...

770
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:40,100
I was worried for nothing.

771
01:32:44,700 --> 01:32:48,900
- I heard that you're looking for an American..
- Continue.

772
01:32:49,700 --> 01:32:55,600
And launching devices were stolen yesterday.

773
01:32:56,300 --> 01:33:00,700
- Seriously?
- I can help you find them.

774
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:04,000
If you agree with that.

775
01:33:09,700 --> 01:33:10,800
Brij Nath.

776
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:13,300
Brij Nath. Playboy. Multimedia tycoon.

777
01:33:13,700 --> 01:33:16,800
On the surface, this turn network as state of the art

778
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:20,300
but its  build time illegally acquired Cold War cast off

779
01:33:20,300 --> 01:33:22,200
including this,the Novosti satellite.

780
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:24,200
Hendricks needs it to launch a nuclear strike,

781
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:27,100
and we have to shut it down, before he gets that chance.

782
01:33:27,100 --> 01:33:29,900
And to do that we need to get the acess codes from him,

783
01:33:29,900 --> 01:33:32,000
one way or another.

784
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,500
And if I don't ...

785
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:37,500
None of this works.

786
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:40,200
- You can do this.
- Yeah.

787
01:33:40,700 --> 01:33:43,400
A week ago I would've believed you.

788
01:33:48,700 --> 01:33:51,500
I don't blame you for what happened.

789
01:33:55,900 --> 01:33:59,100
She took someone you cared about. That just not something ...

790
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:02,100
...you just, let go.

791
01:34:02,700 --> 01:34:06,300
Did that make you feel better?

792
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:10,200
When you kill the man who killed your wife?

793
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:20,800
We can't get them back.

794
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:30,500
Okay, to shut down the satellite we have to
manually tap into the central server.

795
01:34:30,500 --> 01:34:34,300
And you'll enter through the exhaust
vent wearing this under your suit.

796
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:36,500
I'll drop down into the computer ray

797
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:38,900
and I'll catch you, and we
have you along the relay room

798
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:41,100
and you jack into the panel.

799
01:34:44,300 --> 01:34:47,000
Okay, so we enter the party separately as guests

800
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,700
Ethan quarterbacks, while Jane gets the codes ...

801
01:34:49,700 --> 01:34:52,600
from billionaire, I switch off the vent, you jump into the computer,

802
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:54,600
and I'll catch you, you plug in the transmitter,

803
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:58,300
Ethan feeds me the codes, which I then use to pinpoit Hendricks' location.

804
01:34:58,300 --> 01:35:01,700
okay, you breach over something,

805
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:06,600
I think it really important to computer array, part,..
or I just,.. jump?

806
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:09,100
- And I catch you.
- Yeah.

807
01:35:09,100 --> 01:35:11,300
I don't,.. Why is it so hard to grasp?

808
01:35:11,300 --> 01:35:15,600
what, why? it, it's 25 foot drop..

809
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:18,300
- and it's using magnets.
- Yeah

810
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:22,900
In lye of our recent efforts, the technology is. ..

811
01:35:22,900 --> 01:35:26,500
Science is sign. I'd be more worried about the heat.

812
01:35:27,700 --> 01:35:29,900
And then there is that... What heat?

813
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:33,100
Well it's like any computer, isn't it?
If you switch off the fan,

814
01:35:33,100 --> 01:35:35,300
it's gonna get really hot.

815
01:35:35,300 --> 01:35:37,400
- Of course.
- Relatively, you know.

816
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:42,900
Of course it will. So I'm jumping into a ...

817
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:47,300
... an oven.
acentually.

818
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:49,300
Yeah, acentually.

819
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:52,900
But ...uhm, I'll catch you.

820
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:54,520
Great.

821
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:01,320
MUMBAI

822
01:37:17,700 --> 01:37:19,700
Com check?

823
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:22,300
Saturn got you 5 by 5, Jupiter.

824
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:26,200
This is Pluto.

825
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:30,200
I have arrived at the party.

826
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:35,900
There he is.

827
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:49,600
Get us that code.

828
01:37:57,200 --> 01:37:59,600
Venus is moving-in on target.

829
01:38:10,700 --> 01:38:12,900
Hook's in.

830
01:38:14,200 --> 01:38:16,800
you do make an impression.

831
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,300
Why am I Pluto? It's even not a planet anymore.

832
01:38:22,900 --> 01:38:25,500
I think Uranus is available.

833
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:27,700
Hehehe..
It's funny cause you said "anus".

834
01:38:41,700 --> 01:38:44,200
- I'm in position.
- Sending in the robot.

835
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:52,200
He's moving to you. In your back.

836
01:38:53,300 --> 01:38:56,700
- Don't wanna make it too easy for him.
- We can be talking all the time.

837
01:38:57,800 --> 01:39:01,400
In 20 minutes I want a glass of Cuv'e Louis
on every guest's hand.

838
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:04,300
And make sure all of them have  a bottle
take home by the end of the night.

839
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:11,300
Impressed yet?

840
01:39:11,300 --> 01:39:13,900
I'm more a Bourbon girl.

841
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:22,700
I am Brij Nath. Welcome to my humble home.

842
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:47,800
And.. robot's in position.

843
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:50,800
spinning down the turbine.

844
01:39:57,900 --> 01:40:02,200
He's emailing. Venus, V Venus, V Venus.

845
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:14,000
Husband? Boyfriend?

846
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:18,700
More of the co-worker.

847
01:40:18,700 --> 01:40:21,300
Saturn, take the lead.

848
01:40:25,100 --> 01:40:26,350
Okay.

849
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:39,300
- jump now?
- Yes, commit jump!

850
01:40:39,300 --> 01:40:40,600
- Jump?
- Jump!

851
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:43,500
- And I catch you.
- Now!

852
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:50,100
So, ah, you sure about the suit, right, Benji?

853
01:40:50,100 --> 01:40:52,300
Pretty sure.

854
01:40:52,600 --> 01:40:54,800
Now you're pretty sure?

855
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:57,300
Jump!

856
01:40:57,900 --> 01:40:58,620
O God!

857
01:41:00,900 --> 01:41:02,800
Jump!

858
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:04,900
Jump!

859
01:41:22,300 --> 01:41:24,500
Jupiter, he's gone.

860
01:41:29,300 --> 01:41:32,300
- Did you jump?
- Should I not in jump?

861
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:35,800
Cause I jumped!

862
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:38,600
Stand by.

863
01:41:45,900 --> 01:41:50,000
I'm playing a hunch. Don't hit me.

864
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:08,500
Hello?

865
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:12,600
My God, you are a passionate creature.

866
01:42:14,300 --> 01:42:17,400
I would like to show you my collection of art.

867
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:21,700
- I was waiting for you to ask.
- Then you have to find me.

868
01:42:22,300 --> 01:42:25,000
- come on.
- I'm heading upstairs.

869
01:42:43,300 --> 01:42:46,100
All right, and be careful.
It probably getting a bit hot.

870
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:49,500
You have to get to that satellite, before Hendricks does.

871
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:10,200
Look left, look up.
I find your complicious passion intriguing.

872
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:17,400
You can keep repeat telling anyone, but he's not your type.
completely not your type. He's completely cold, I'm hot.

873
01:43:18,700 --> 01:43:21,200
Like all Indian men are very hot.

874
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:25,400
8 o'clock, he's at your 8 o'clock.

875
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:28,500
As you walk toward me, you're getting hotter.

876
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,400
It's too much! too much, too much!

877
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:40,600
I see you.

878
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:45,200
I heard you have one of the finest
private collections in the world.

879
01:43:45,200 --> 01:43:48,100
Well, of the very licensed private  .

880
01:44:06,900 --> 01:44:09,000
Saturn, how are we doing in Relay room?

881
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,100
in position.

882
01:44:12,700 --> 01:44:14,800
I see the satellite .

883
01:44:20,500 --> 01:44:23,400
- Can I help you gentlemen?
- I don't think so.

884
01:44:29,700 --> 01:44:32,000
I need those codes, guys.

885
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:43,300
All originals from Shatpur district

886
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:49,000
You know the tantrics believe ...

887
01:44:50,300 --> 01:44:54,600
That there's lust chakra hide on most subconscious of desires..

888
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:51,100
Uplink to satellite. Reboot to original military specs.

889
01:45:51,100 --> 01:45:53,800
Download the virus.

890
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,200
What hell is that?

891
01:46:04,100 --> 01:46:06,400
- What the hell is that?
- What the hell's what?

892
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:09,700
- It's going haywire!
- It downloaded the virus from the satellite.

893
01:46:09,700 --> 01:46:12,700
Hendricks is killing the server,
before we can count the satellite.

894
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:14,600
Hendricks is reprogramming the satellite.

895
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:17,400
He's gonna lost its capabilty in five minutes.

896
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,500
- Is something wrong?
- No.

897
01:46:20,500 --> 01:46:23,200
Jane, you gotta move. We need that code.

898
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:26,000
Finally we are alone.

899
01:46:32,700 --> 01:46:36,200
Venus, now is your turn.
You kick his ass and get the code.

900
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:40,700
We are alone, aren't we?

901
01:46:40,700 --> 01:46:44,300
No one will interrupt us.

902
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:49,700
Move and I break your neck!

903
01:46:49,700 --> 01:46:52,200
The override sequence for the relay station.

904
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:54,900
Say it now, and never speak again!

905
01:46:55,900 --> 01:46:57,800
The codes!

906
01:46:57,800 --> 01:46:59,000
46-82-123.

907
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:08,600
- Benji, what happened?
- The system crashed, we're too late.

908
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:10,300
No, no, no. He reveals himself.

909
01:47:10,300 --> 01:47:12,400
Benji, can you pinpoint Hendricks location?

910
01:47:13,400 --> 01:47:17,200
Hendricks is signaling at a state room
tv station 6.7 miles from here.

911
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:20,300
Send me the coordinates. Good work Brandt.
Now, get the hell out of there.

912
01:47:20,300 --> 01:47:21,400
Back me up!

913
01:47:21,400 --> 01:47:24,700
Jane, time over on Nath. Meet me at the rally point.

914
01:47:29,300 --> 01:47:31,100
Sweet love.

915
01:47:31,400 --> 01:47:33,900
Faster, Benji. Just through it trough.

916
01:47:37,400 --> 01:47:40,300
Wait, stop! Take me through.

917
01:47:40,300 --> 01:47:44,000
It's not responding.
A liitle bit of patient would be appreciated.

918
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:01,800
ah, can't reach the top!

919
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:06,400
more fan, more fan, more fan!

920
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:08,800
There's nothing I can do, it maxed out.

921
01:48:27,200 --> 01:48:29,200
Brandt?

922
01:48:29,700 --> 01:48:33,500
Next time, I gonna seduce the rich guy.

923
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,400
Satellite's weaponized and online.

924
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:48,700
Upload the new authentication codes.

925
01:48:48,700 --> 01:48:51,100
Lock Russian Central Command out of the system.

926
01:48:51,100 --> 01:48:54,600
Isolate the sub, with fire just one missile.

927
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:57,700
An apparent retaliation for the Kremlin.

928
01:48:57,700 --> 01:48:59,900
That should start the ball running.

929
01:48:59,900 --> 01:49:01,500
I am here, Ethan.

930
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:04,000
How long it till Hendricks can launch the missile?

931
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,900
Less than 30 seconds.

932
01:49:07,300 --> 01:49:09,300
Find another route.

933
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:12,700
Turn left, up ahead, take the only way on the right.

934
01:49:27,100 --> 01:49:28,900
We have uplink.

935
01:49:38,900 --> 01:49:41,400
Ethan, Hendricks has started launch sequence.

936
01:49:41,400 --> 01:49:44,200
- How much time till the missiles are flight ?
- Three minutes!

937
01:49:48,300 --> 01:49:50,800
We're three  and half minutes out.

938
01:49:53,200 --> 01:49:55,400
We can make it.

939
01:49:56,200 --> 01:49:57,600
We can make it.

940
01:49:57,600 --> 01:50:01,200
Magellan Strait Pacific Ocean

941
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:05,600
Captain!

942
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:12,600
Call the head office to ask if
approved launching missiles.

943
01:50:12,600 --> 01:50:13,600
I understand!

944
01:50:14,900 --> 01:50:17,900
Iron gun start operation.

945
01:50:17,900 --> 01:50:20,100
Confirm the order of attack.

946
01:50:20,100 --> 01:50:22,300
Stop communication devices.

947
01:50:22,300 --> 01:50:24,400
Done.

948
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:27,900
Next left.

949
01:50:40,300 --> 01:50:42,100
Continue.

950
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:04,700
Ethan, we're too late.

951
01:51:04,700 --> 01:51:07,000
The missile's in the air.

952
01:51:19,100 --> 01:51:21,100
There has to be a way to abort the warhead.

953
01:51:21,100 --> 01:51:22,900
If there is a wild on the launch device.

954
01:51:22,900 --> 01:51:25,400
We gonna get that case!

955
01:51:34,900 --> 01:51:38,200
May there be peace on Earth.

956
01:51:42,500 --> 01:51:44,900
Disable the relay!

957
01:51:45,400 --> 01:51:47,600
Get Wistrom!
Inside, inside!

958
01:52:22,100 --> 01:52:23,900
Wistrom destroyed the relay.

959
01:52:23,900 --> 01:52:26,300
- Ethan ran after Hendricks and case, but..
- It doesn't matter if he has the case.

960
01:52:27,900 --> 01:52:31,700
- Can you fix it? - ah yeah, but it's gonna be
pointless we don't have any power.

961
01:52:31,700 --> 01:52:33,300
Wistrom!

962
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:37,100
- Jane?
- I'm okay.

963
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:40,600
oh, you are not okay, she's hit.

964
01:52:40,600 --> 01:52:42,400
You stay here and cover Benji.

965
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:45,700
- Benji, get the single wire back online!
- I get the power on.

966
01:52:45,700 --> 01:52:46,900
We can do this.

967
01:56:01,500 --> 01:56:05,000
I'm taking that briefcase!

968
01:56:08,200 --> 01:56:10,200
No, no!

969
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:58,800
- He's been gone too long.
- Dammit!

970
01:56:58,800 --> 01:57:02,800
Listen, when the power comes on,
this two drives are going to this bay, okay?

971
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:49,700
Mission...
accomplished!

972
01:58:00,100 --> 01:58:01,800
Damn!

973
01:58:30,700 --> 01:58:32,600
Do not shoot!

974
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:41,000
This one is mine.

975
01:58:52,700 --> 01:58:56,300
So we are not enemies?

976
01:58:57,400 --> 01:59:00,800
There a phone call from that arm stealer in Dubai.

977
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:03,900
You wanted me to find you.

978
01:59:06,200 --> 01:59:09,200
How else to deal with all these?

979
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:17,080
hospital?

980
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:22,440
SEATTLE

981
01:59:25,600 --> 01:59:28,200
(news) ...some sort of aircraft.

982
01:59:28,200 --> 01:59:31,900
but officials of Department of Defense
insisted was simply a meteor...

983
01:59:31,900 --> 01:59:34,400
large enough to be visible during daylight.

984
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:36,600
You actually said that?

985
01:59:36,600 --> 01:59:39,900
Outloud?
Mission accomplished?

986
01:59:40,300 --> 01:59:43,500
- I said it.
- You're still cornered Ethan.

987
01:59:43,900 --> 01:59:46,600
And I can't imagine the look on that guy's face.

988
01:59:48,300 --> 01:59:50,500
- Hey
- These must be them.

989
01:59:50,500 --> 01:59:54,100
Luther Stickell, the affirmative,
Carter, Dunn and Brandt.

990
01:59:55,400 --> 01:59:59,100
I borrowed an entire week in the
bottom of the San Francisco bay

991
02:00:00,200 --> 02:00:02,400
Well thanks to you class..

992
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:07,100
How do you know I got this ...

993
02:00:07,100 --> 02:00:10,200
I know. I see you in Kandahar.

994
02:00:13,500 --> 02:00:15,800
Hey thanks for meeting me.

995
02:00:15,800 --> 02:00:18,500
So, I heard the insurance companies
refused into pay the claim

996
02:00:18,500 --> 02:00:20,500
on that car you crashed, Ethan.

997
02:00:20,500 --> 02:00:24,300
Something about intentional a hundred meters
that could drop not being covered.

998
02:00:24,300 --> 02:00:26,000
Go figured.

999
02:00:28,900 --> 02:00:31,900
- How's the leg?
- Still working.

1000
02:00:32,900 --> 02:00:35,400
- You?
- Healing.

1001
02:00:37,500 --> 02:00:39,700
I'm fine, by the way.

1002
02:00:39,700 --> 02:00:43,400
But I'm not actually sleeping per say, you know.

1003
02:00:43,400 --> 02:00:45,100
Caught sweats, middle of the night.

1004
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,700
All these people are just happy and smiling,

1005
02:00:48,700 --> 02:00:53,000
and they are completely oblivious,
for the fact they were almost...vaporized.

1006
02:00:53,800 --> 02:00:57,100
- and if I've been inferred...
- Dumb luck?

1007
02:00:57,600 --> 02:00:59,000
Was it?

1008
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:03,700
I mean, look, we were unprepared, in the dark,

1009
02:01:03,700 --> 02:01:05,800
disavowed.

1010
02:01:06,300 --> 02:01:08,600
The only thing that functioned properly

1011
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,300
on that mission,

1012
02:01:11,800 --> 02:01:13,900
was this team.

1013
02:01:15,100 --> 02:01:17,700
I don't know how we ended up together,

1014
02:01:19,600 --> 02:01:22,000
but I'm glad we did.

1015
02:01:28,400 --> 02:01:30,700
Your missions.

1016
02:01:30,700 --> 02:01:33,300
Choose to accept them.

1017
02:01:37,900 --> 02:01:39,600
all right ... you know, I am in.

1018
02:01:39,900 --> 02:01:43,700
Seriously, this is not as hard as any mission
gonna rougher than the last one, is it?

1019
02:01:45,400 --> 02:01:48,400
It's just ... a bomb, is it?

1020
02:02:06,700 --> 02:02:09,400
- Thanks, Ethan.
- I thank you.

1021
02:02:11,500 --> 02:02:14,400
- Agent Hunt.
- Agent Carter.

1022
02:02:22,800 --> 02:02:24,900
Brandt.

1023
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:31,600
I'm not picking up that phone Ethan,
because I don't think you want me the field

1024
02:02:34,300 --> 02:02:37,000
I know your wife is dead.

1025
02:02:38,600 --> 02:02:41,600
I was there in Croatia.

1026
02:02:42,500 --> 02:02:45,200
I was there for one reason. One.

1027
02:02:46,200 --> 02:02:48,500
And I failed.

1028
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,200
It was my job to protect her.

1029
02:02:54,200 --> 02:02:57,100
How do you know she's dead?

1030
02:03:05,500 --> 02:03:08,600
- You killed those Serbians.
- I had to get her back.

1031
02:03:08,600 --> 02:03:10,500
You sent out to rankout prison.

1032
02:03:10,500 --> 02:03:12,400
That was a sacrifice I'm willing to make.

1033
02:03:12,400 --> 02:03:15,800
IMF suspected that Hendricks had people in rankout.

1034
02:03:18,100 --> 02:03:21,100
And six dead Serbians was your idea of cover?

1035
02:03:22,400 --> 02:03:25,200
I always not one, not

1036
02:03:41,200 --> 02:03:44,000
Secretary never told me.

1037
02:03:47,200 --> 02:03:50,600
I accepted the direct call prison mission on one condition.

1038
02:03:50,600 --> 02:03:53,900
No one can know she's still alive.

1039
02:03:54,400 --> 02:03:57,400
But ... you telling me.

1040
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:07,800
When did you find out that I was in Croatia?

1041
02:04:07,800 --> 02:04:12,300
- I put your file, after India.
- Great.

1042
02:04:14,200 --> 02:04:17,300
So, you had to fake your wife's death.

1043
02:04:17,800 --> 02:04:21,100
As long as we're together, she can never be safe.

1044
02:04:21,800 --> 02:04:24,700
It wasn't your job to protect her, Brandt.

1045
02:04:27,100 --> 02:04:29,300
It's mine.

1046
02:04:35,500 --> 02:04:39,500
- So we're good?
- We're good.

1047
02:06:00,900 --> 02:06:02,400
Good evening, Mr. Hunt.

1048
02:06:02,400 --> 02:06:06,300
36 hours ago, there was a breach on
military's communication network.

1049
02:06:06,300 --> 02:06:11,000
Now, an emerging terror organization
known as the Syndicate,

1050
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:12,400
has control over entire drone fleet.

1051
02:06:12,400 --> 02:06:19,100
Your targets: unknown.
Your mission, should you choose to accept it...
