Linda, with Ben, it was never
a question of "if," but "when."

I thought it'd be three plus.

Minus $35,000 for bait, tackle, fuel.
That comes out to $38,500.

- A few days.

00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,459
You're going away again?

181
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:03,130
Yeah.

182
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:05,757
Take me with you.

183
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,013
Come here.

184
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:15,434
Go back, Bobby.

185
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,937
Go back to what you did before.

186
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:22,191
- Pack cod, repair tackle.
- I'm sick of that.

187
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:24,234
It's safe and it pays.

188
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:26,403
Not enough.

189
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,114
Just one more time. I promise.

190
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:32,117
I have to try it again.
We need the money, baby.

191
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:34,912
Money. It's always about the money.

192
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:39,917
Well, I got a divorce lawyer,
a mountain of debt.

193
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,880
And there's your two kids.
You gotta get them back.

194
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:49,009
Do you think you'll love them?

195
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:51,094
They're yours, aren't they?

196
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:12,449
Hey, beautiful.

197
00:17:12,783 --> 00:17:13,909
Yeah, you.

198
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:16,537
Buy you a drink?

199
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:20,415
Seeing as I got two in front of me,
I don't think so.

200
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,335
I'm not very observant, am I?

201
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:27,923
I got a feeling, yeah,
along with a lot of other things.

202
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:29,883
Why don't we start over?

203
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:34,263
You know what would look good on you?
Me.

204
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:38,642
No good?

205
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:44,982
Have a drink. It's not that bad.

206
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:49,570
Thank you. Here's to crime.

207
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:52,990
(LAUGHS)

208
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:57,703
You're pathetic.

209
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:02,708
You still want to be a fisherman?

210
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,502
Who told you I wanted to be
a fisherman?

211
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,296
You want to come with me.

212
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:10,924
I want to come with you,
but I don't want to be a fisherman.

213
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:17,431
You know, buddy...

214
00:18:19,725 --> 00:18:23,312
...one of these days your mom's
gonna find you a new dad.

215
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,731
I don't want a new dad.

216
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,107
I'm sorry.

217
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:30,110
Your mom can't sit around
by herself all the time.

218
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:32,613
She isn't sitting around.

219
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,882
MURPH:
I'm sure he's a good guy.

220
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:56,428
I know your mom wouldn't take up
with anybody but a good guy.

221
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:01,850
And you know, buddy...

222
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,812
...the most important thing is
that you and Mommy are happy.

223
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:10,234
Can we talk about something else now?

224
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:13,737
Come here.

225
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:23,914
I miss you too, buddy.

226
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:32,506
I miss you so damn much.

227
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:37,010
What'd you say your name was again?

228
00:19:37,553 --> 00:19:39,596
Irene. Is that so tough?

229
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:41,473
I'm sorry. Listen.

230
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,018
Could I maybe take you home?

231
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:46,979
I don't think so.

232
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:52,359
I came to watch the game. Instead I
got schnockered with Bugsy.

233
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:56,822
- What does Bugsy stand for anyway?
- Michael.

234
00:19:57,489 --> 00:19:59,867
That's a nice name.
Why don't you use it?

235
00:20:00,284 --> 00:20:01,952
Because people know me as Bugsy.

236
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:06,999
I'm gonna shove off now.
Big day tomorrow.

237
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:09,751
I can't take you home?

238
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:11,628
What, in a wheelbarrow?

239
00:20:11,837 --> 00:20:13,755
Crew guys like you never have cars.

240
00:20:13,964 --> 00:20:16,592
Lay off. I got feelings too.

241
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,761
Where, down in your pants?

242
00:20:21,013 --> 00:20:24,183
Jesus, lady, where's the passion
in your life?

243
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:26,435
Home in bed.

244
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:29,104
One of them's 6, the other one's 8.

245
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:33,901
All I can say is,
there's some lucky kids.

246
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:36,111
They got a wonderful mother.

247
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:43,911
You're not messing with me, are you?

248
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:48,373
Haven't got time.
We're going out in two days.

249
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:52,377
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, Michael.

250
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:55,297
Gotta go.

251
00:20:57,049 --> 00:20:58,383
What do you mean?

252
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:02,262
- Where you going?
- Have these.

253
00:21:02,471 --> 00:21:04,097
- Thank you.
- See you.

254
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:10,145
IRENE: Bye, Ethel.
BUGSY: See you.

255
00:21:24,618 --> 00:21:25,536
- Heave.
- Swift.

256
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:27,412
Whoa, Jesus!

257
00:21:28,247 --> 00:21:29,289
Watch your step.

258
00:21:38,257 --> 00:21:39,091
Hm.

259
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:41,176
I smell Coppertone.

260
00:21:41,385 --> 00:21:43,345
That means that
Captain Linda Greenlaw...

261
00:21:43,554 --> 00:21:46,807
...a lady vain about her nose,
is in my wheelhouse.

262
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:48,392
Make that Hawaiian Tropic.

263
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,686
At least I got the nose right.

264
00:21:51,812 --> 00:21:54,523
Your guys are loading bait
and groceries.

265
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:58,569
- You doing a turnaround?
- No rest for the weary.

266
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:01,029
There you go.
Flaunting your work ethic.

267
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:03,532
I don't have a work ethic.
I just have work.

268
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:05,617
If I'm gonna catch up to you.

269
00:22:06,702 --> 00:22:08,453
I love to watch you study charts.

270
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:09,997
Why?

271
00:22:10,414 --> 00:22:11,915
You know them all by heart.

272
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:15,794
What's special about today
that you're blowing smoke up my ass?

273
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:17,337
I thought I'd make a pass.

274
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:24,887
You see, I'm looking for a guy
to come home to Maine with me...

275
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:26,597
...buy a house and raise kids.

276
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:28,724
What does that guy and you do after?

277
00:22:28,974 --> 00:22:30,017
Oh.

278
00:22:30,225 --> 00:22:33,478
The thing is, I'm happy.
I'm happy I'm fit to do this.

279
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:35,814
I just don't see the romance in it.

280
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:38,942
But you've got it, Captain Greenlaw.

281
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:41,111
You do. Believe me.

282
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,071
I've seen them come and go.

283
00:22:43,322 --> 00:22:46,783
The day I laid eyes on you, I said,
"She's gonna be a good one."

284
00:22:47,451 --> 00:22:49,286
You can't be good unless you love it.

285
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:53,624
The fog's just lifting.

286
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:57,544
You throw off your bow line,
throw off your stern.

287
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:01,048
You head out the South Channel...

288
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:04,510
...past Rocky Neck,
Ten Pound Island...

289
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:08,639
...past Niles Pond,
where I skated as a kid.

290
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:10,557
Blow your horn...

291
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:13,852
...and wave to the lighthouse
keeper's kid on Thatcher Island.

292
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:16,313
Then the birds show up.

293
00:23:16,522 --> 00:23:18,106
Black-backs...

294
00:23:18,357 --> 00:23:21,276
...herring gulls, big dump ducks.

295
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:24,571
The sun hits you.

296
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,491
Head north, open up to 12.

297
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:29,618
You're steaming now.

298
00:23:30,536 --> 00:23:33,455
The guys are busy,
you're in charge.

299
00:23:34,748 --> 00:23:38,043
You know what?
You're a goddamn swordboat captain.

300
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:43,382
Is there anything better in the world?

301
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:57,855
Sully.

302
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:02,901
So what do you think?

303
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:08,365
You been busy?

304
00:24:08,574 --> 00:24:09,992
Busy enough.

305
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,870
I was working menhaden in Annisquam.

306
00:24:13,245 --> 00:24:15,247
But they laid off Labor Day.

307
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:17,457
Mended nets over in Fairhaven.

308
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:20,502
That's crap.
What's this you're doing now?

309
00:24:21,879 --> 00:24:23,213
Helping out a friend.

310
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:24,882
He paying you?

311
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:27,050
He's my friend.

312
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:33,015
Murphy keep his site?

313
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,520
You want this job or not?

314
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:41,648
I do.

315
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:43,859
Yeah.

Lord, did I do that?

321
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:54,179
Yeah, you did.

322
00:25:55,264 --> 00:25:59,101
But I'm not completely blind.
I can still see out of the other one.

323
00:26:00,352 --> 00:26:01,603
Next time I should break a leg.

324
00:26:01,812 --> 00:26:04,523
Then you can stay home
and collect disability.

325
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:07,734
Think of all those
handicapped parking spaces.

326
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:13,282
Tell me last night was worth it.

327
00:26:13,991 --> 00:26:15,701
I can't remember.

328
00:26:16,368 --> 00:26:18,912
Can't remember, my ass.

329
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:21,540
No, I remember your ass.

330
00:26:23,709 --> 00:26:25,586

would never come.

TODD ON TV: The activity down near
Bermuda is deepening rapidly.

540

Given the warm and volatile
Gulf Stream...

541

this tropical storm into a hurricane.

545
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:35,235
I put so much ground beef and sausage
in this, it weighed out at 20 pounds.

More than most of our fish weigh.

You know why this lasagna weighs
20 pounds?

552
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:51,502
It tasted like you
threw in a shot put.

553

I once worked a site

The guy had a real bad accident.

00:58:58,121 --> 00:59:00,874
Murph going over, the shark,
a rogue wave...

709
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:02,084
Yeah, what else?

710
00:59:03,752 --> 00:59:07,673
Never mind unlucky.
We're just looking for some fish.

711
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:11,927
We had slumps before, you and I,
but nothing like this.

712
00:59:12,135 --> 00:59:15,597
You boys look like you got busted
in a brawl in Scollay Square.

713
00:59:15,806 --> 00:59:18,058
That's how we feel.
We want to go home.

714
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:23,605
You want to go home? You lonely for
that young mama who was all over you?

715
00:59:23,814 --> 00:59:25,858
My girl is none of your business.

716
00:59:26,066 --> 00:59:29,528
But you are. If you don't like it,
get the hell off! All of you.

717
00:59:32,906 --> 00:59:36,451
I look around and all I see are
little boys sitting on their asses...

718
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:38,745
...too scared to go
and get some pay dirt.

719
00:59:38,954 --> 00:59:42,374
Pay dirt? What are you talking about?
Where the hell is that?

720
00:59:42,583 --> 00:59:44,001
We covered the Grand Banks.

721
00:59:44,334 --> 00:59:47,171
The Grand Banks are west of us.
I'm headed east.

723
00:59:53,093 --> 00:59:54,761
The Flemish Cap?

724
00:59:55,304 --> 00:59:58,348
Why don't we steam to Portugal
while we're at it?

725
01:00:03,353 --> 01:00:05,689
So this is the moment of truth.

726
01:00:08,734 --> 01:00:11,069
This is where they separate
the men from the boys.

727
01:00:15,616 --> 01:00:16,867
How about it?

728
01:00:19,745 --> 01:00:21,538
- Are you Gloucestermen?
- Yeah.

729
01:00:21,788 --> 01:00:24,708
But why go all the way
to the Flemish Cap to prove it?

730
01:00:25,375 --> 01:00:26,919
Tell him, Alfred Pierre.

731
01:00:29,463 --> 01:00:31,048
That's where the fish are.

732
01:00:34,218 --> 01:00:35,844
Do we have any other choice?

733
01:00:36,553 --> 01:00:39,097
Yeah. Crawl home, busted.

734
01:00:47,314 --> 01:00:49,399

- All right.

735

Yeah, I'm steaming full-bore.

752

nearly off the charts.

What are you trying to prove?

754
01:01:49,543 --> 01:01:53,755
We got gale-force coming out
of Bermuda, stuff out of Sable Island.

at solid white chop.

COAST GUARD ON RADIO: Mistral,
this is Coast Guard rescue.

882
01:11:11,813 --> 01:11:13,023
Sandy!

883
01:11:15,776 --> 01:11:18,946
Edie, they heard me!
They're coming!

884
01:11:20,489 --> 01:11:24,076
(LAUGHS)

885
01:11:29,957 --> 01:11:31,959
PILOT:
Air Force rescue 2-3-1.

886
01:11:32,167 --> 01:11:34,002
We've located the Mistral.

887
01:11:34,253 --> 01:11:36,588
Position: 39.49 north...

888
01:11:36,797 --> 01:11:38,924
...69.52 west.

889
01:11:41,552 --> 01:11:43,095
How far's that last position?

890
01:11:43,303 --> 01:11:45,222
About 20.3 miles, captain.

891
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:47,349
CAPTAIN:
OD, boatswain on the bridge.

892
01:11:47,641 --> 01:11:50,227
(SHOUTING)

893
01:11:52,521 --> 01:11:54,106
Tallyho, there they are.

894
01:11:59,653 --> 01:12:02,531
- Okay, guys, showtime.
- You got it.

895
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:04,825
DARRYL:
Mistral, this is 2-3-1.

896
01:12:05,033 --> 01:12:08,328
We're gonna extract you
one at a time from the deck.

897
01:12:08,662 --> 01:12:10,914
Hey, Jeremy, I don't like this.

898
01:12:11,290 --> 01:12:14,626
DARRYL: Clock's ticking.
JEREMY: We better get them off now.

899
01:12:14,835 --> 01:12:15,878
Get closer, Darryl.

900
01:12:16,211 --> 01:12:17,504
Just a little closer.

901
01:12:17,754 --> 01:12:21,717
(SHOUTING)

902
01:12:22,593 --> 01:12:24,678
JEREMY:
Okay, deploying the basket.

903
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:27,222
Close to 2:00.

904
01:12:27,472 --> 01:12:28,724
Let's come right to 5.

905
01:12:29,349 --> 01:12:31,476
- Four. Three.
- Son of a bitch.

906
01:12:31,685 --> 01:12:33,604
Stop there. Hold your hover.

907
01:12:33,854 --> 01:12:35,022
Goddamn it!

908
01:12:35,230 --> 01:12:37,608
JEREMY:
Keep it steady, keep it steady.

909
01:12:39,526 --> 01:12:40,569
Shit!

910
01:12:47,159 --> 01:12:48,619
JEREMY:
Man out!

911
01:12:49,203 --> 01:12:51,455
- Shear the cable!
- No, I got it!

912
01:12:55,501 --> 01:12:57,503
Sandy!

913
01:13:05,344 --> 01:13:07,054
Sandy!

914
01:13:09,014 --> 01:13:10,015
Shit.

915
01:13:10,265 --> 01:13:11,767
DARRYL:
Bring up the basket!

916
01:13:15,437 --> 01:13:16,730
Sandy!

917
01:13:17,606 --> 01:13:18,857
Hold on!

918
01:13:19,066 --> 01:13:20,359
I got you!

919
01:13:20,692 --> 01:13:23,153
- Basket's in.
- Looks like I'm going for a swim.

920
01:13:23,362 --> 01:13:24,530
Okay, go get them.

921
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:26,406
Mitchell off intercom.

922
01:13:27,407 --> 01:13:28,867
It's time to get wet.

923
01:13:31,161 --> 01:13:33,288
We're gonna be all right.

924
01:13:34,873 --> 01:13:35,874
Go.

925
01:14:11,493 --> 01:14:12,494
Altitude.

926
01:14:13,662 --> 01:14:15,789
Altitude. Get her up, get her up!

927
01:14:21,503 --> 01:14:22,671
He's in the water.

928
01:14:26,592 --> 01:14:28,218
I'm going after him!

929
01:14:28,427 --> 01:14:29,845
No, no, wait! Stand by!

930
01:14:32,139 --> 01:14:33,682
DARRYL:
Jonesy, hold on.

931
01:14:42,608 --> 01:14:43,859
There! He's okay.

932
01:14:44,401 --> 01:14:47,154
JEREMY: This isn't working.
They'll have to get in the water.

933
01:14:58,457 --> 01:15:00,542
Come on, come on!

934
01:15:01,418 --> 01:15:02,961
You're having a blast, huh?

935
01:15:03,170 --> 01:15:06,423
- Want a turn?
- No, just watch. I want to watch.

936
01:15:06,632 --> 01:15:09,426
I'm studying up for the day
I get my own boat.

937
01:15:09,718 --> 01:15:11,470
Your own boat, huh?

938
01:15:11,678 --> 01:15:14,097
Want to give me a hand?
Grab the throttle.

939
01:15:16,850 --> 01:15:18,227
Hang on.

940
01:15:18,685 --> 01:15:21,104
(YELLS)

941
01:15:21,313 --> 01:15:23,148
- Ah, shit!
- Seven K, six easy.

942
01:15:23,357 --> 01:15:24,983
- Eight minimum.
- Ten.

943
01:15:25,442 --> 01:15:28,737
You know, I'm gonna get me
a new used Ford F-150...

944
01:15:28,987 --> 01:15:30,989
...take a ride to Digby with Irene.

945
01:15:31,198 --> 01:15:35,369
Going to get drunk, eat like a pig
and sleep like a child!

946
01:15:35,577 --> 01:15:37,037
Fish and fun-gee!

947
01:15:40,457 --> 01:15:44,795
DARRYL: Okay, Jer, too risky to
go lower. You gotta jump from here.

948
01:16:01,061 --> 01:16:04,565
Good afternoon, madam.
I'm Sergeant Jeremy Mitchell.

949
01:16:04,773 --> 01:16:07,150
I'll be your para-rescue jumper today.

950
01:16:07,484 --> 01:16:08,944
How are you?

951
01:16:09,194 --> 01:16:10,779
Okay so far.

952
01:16:26,628 --> 01:16:29,715
Keep your hands
and feet in the basket.

953
01:16:33,802 --> 01:16:35,095
- Careful.
- Okay!

954
01:16:35,304 --> 01:16:36,972
All right, here we go.

955
01:16:44,271 --> 01:16:45,230
You're next.

956
01:16:55,115 --> 01:16:56,700
Ah! Yeah!

957
01:16:56,909 --> 01:16:58,619
That was nothing!

958
01:16:59,077 --> 01:17:00,120
BILLY:
Come on!

959
01:17:14,551 --> 01:17:16,053
Oh, my God.

960
01:17:16,929 --> 01:17:18,514
It's happening.

961
01:17:56,218 --> 01:17:59,388
Andrea Gail, Andrea Gail.
This is Hannah Boden.

962
01:17:59,638 --> 01:18:03,767
(SHOUTING)

963
01:18:03,976 --> 01:18:05,185
...Billy, over.

964
01:18:06,895 --> 01:18:08,063
Calling the Andrea Gail.

965
01:18:08,313 --> 01:18:12,317
(BROKEN VOICE ON RADIO)

966
01:18:14,528 --> 01:18:16,947
Andrea Gail, do you read me?

967
01:18:17,155 --> 01:18:19,324
Do you read me? Come in!

968
01:18:19,533 --> 01:18:23,662
Come in, for God's sake, come in!
Billy, these storms have collided!

969
01:18:23,871 --> 01:18:25,289
They are exploding!

970
01:18:27,749 --> 01:18:29,042
Who is it?

971
01:18:29,710 --> 01:18:30,544
I don't know.

972
01:18:30,752 --> 01:18:32,588
Andrea Gail, come in!

973
01:18:33,839 --> 01:18:36,925
Whiskey-Yankee-Charlie 6-6-8-1, over.

974
01:18:37,134 --> 01:18:38,635
Talk to me, Billy, over.

975
01:18:38,844 --> 01:18:41,263
I repeat,
Whiskey-Yankee-Charlie 6-6-8-1...

976
01:18:43,390 --> 01:18:45,809
Look at your fax, damn it!
Look at your fax!

977
01:18:46,018 --> 01:18:49,104
Whiskey-Yankee-Charlie 6-6-8-1, over!

978
01:18:49,313 --> 01:18:51,732
LINDA: Where are you, Billy?
BILLY: Linda?

979
01:18:51,940 --> 01:18:53,150
Give me the coordinates.

980
01:18:53,358 --> 01:18:56,528
- 44 north, 56.4 west.
- We're 44 north...

981
01:18:56,737 --> 01:18:59,489
...56.4 west, headed west.

982
01:18:59,948 --> 01:19:04,912
I repeat, 44 north,
56.4 west, headed...

983
01:19:05,787 --> 01:19:07,372
Over.

984
01:19:07,581 --> 01:19:10,083
Billy, get out of there.

985
01:19:10,626 --> 01:19:14,004
Come about! Let it carry you out!
What the hell are you doing?

986
01:19:14,254 --> 01:19:15,339
Hang on!

987
01:19:17,049 --> 01:19:20,385
Billy! Billy, for chrissake!

988
01:19:20,594 --> 01:19:24,139
You're steaming into a bomb!
Turn around, for chrissake!

989
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:27,684
It's the antenna.

990
01:19:27,893 --> 01:19:30,103
Billy, can you hear me?

991
01:19:30,437 --> 01:19:34,024
You're headed right
for the middle of the monster.

992
01:19:35,192 --> 01:19:36,151
Billy.

993
01:19:43,617 --> 01:19:45,452
Oh, my God.

994
01:19:53,126 --> 01:19:54,169
(SQUEALS)

995
01:19:54,419 --> 01:19:55,462
BILLY:
Hang on!

996
01:19:57,214 --> 01:19:58,423
Take the wheel.

997
01:19:58,924 --> 01:20:00,300
No, I'll go.

998
01:20:02,344 --> 01:20:04,221
Mayday, mayday, mayday...

999
01:20:04,429 --> 01:20:06,139
...Coast Guard Boston.

1000
01:20:06,974 --> 01:20:10,102
This is fishing vessel Hannah Boden
relaying a mayday...

1001
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:12,563
...for swordboat Andrea Gail.

1002
01:20:12,813 --> 01:20:15,858
Last position, 44 north...

1003
01:20:16,233 --> 01:20:19,653
...56.4 west, over.

1004
01:20:20,654 --> 01:20:24,992
COAST GUARD: Advise you proceed to
next incident at your discretion, over.

1005
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:26,994
Yeah, roger, Boston.

1006
01:20:27,202 --> 01:20:30,080
I just got a mayday on a Gloucester
swordboat, the Andrea Gail.

1007
01:20:30,330 --> 01:20:34,751
44 north, 56.4 west, headed west.

1008
01:20:35,169 --> 01:20:37,713
Jesus. That's straight into hell.

1009
01:20:37,963 --> 01:20:40,799
Gloucester.
They're always from Gloucester.

1010
01:20:41,008 --> 01:20:44,803
It's an increased-risk mission,
so, you know, it's up to us.

1011
01:20:45,012 --> 01:20:47,181
I'm getting
a little air-to-air feeling.

1012
01:20:47,389 --> 01:20:49,349
Refuel in hell?
That's pretty sporty.

1013
01:20:49,683 --> 01:20:51,685
Call the cutter.
We're coming in hot.

1014
01:20:52,102 --> 01:20:54,938
People, slight change of plans!

1015
01:20:55,397 --> 01:20:58,358
We're gonna drop you on
the Coast Guard cutter Tamaroa.

1016
01:20:58,567 --> 01:21:01,695
We got some swordfishermen
who have lost their way.

1017
01:21:03,197 --> 01:21:04,781
Or their minds.

1018
01:21:45,072 --> 01:21:48,116
DARRYL: This is rescue 2-3-1
on final approach.

1019
01:21:48,325 --> 01:21:52,120
CONTROLLER:
Rescue 2-3-1, flight deck is green.

1020
01:21:52,746 --> 01:21:55,165
There it is.
You're being waved in.

1021
01:21:55,374 --> 01:21:57,000
Thirty meters and closing.

1022
01:21:57,209 --> 01:21:59,586
MAN:
Twenty-five meters, winds 43.

1023
01:21:59,795 --> 01:22:02,089
Set a line at 0-1 -0.

1024
01:22:02,548 --> 01:22:04,925
DARRYL:
Beautiful. We're coming.

1025
01:22:05,133 --> 01:22:06,343
JEREMY:
Watch this wave, cap.

1026
01:22:06,552 --> 01:22:08,595
CONTROLLER: 2-3-1, looking good.
Transfer at will.

1027
01:22:08,804 --> 01:22:09,888
Drop ladder.

1028
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:14,768
All right, send them down.

1029
01:22:14,977 --> 01:22:16,144
Put your foot out.

1030
01:22:16,854 --> 01:22:17,729
Left leg out.

1031
01:22:17,938 --> 01:22:19,815
Mind your helm, goddamn it.

1032
01:22:22,317 --> 01:22:23,735
Watch the deck!

1033
01:22:24,903 --> 01:22:26,154
Come on.

1034
01:22:27,030 --> 01:22:28,740
First survivor on deck.

1035
01:22:28,949 --> 01:22:32,494
- Where's our fuel?
- Refueling tanker is on the way.

1036
01:22:33,579 --> 01:22:35,539
JEREMY:
Second survivor on deck.

1037
01:22:35,789 --> 01:22:36,957
Jesus.

1038
01:23:37,392 --> 01:23:38,393
It's gone.

1039
01:23:40,854 --> 01:23:44,525
No antenna, no radio.
We're back in the 19th century.

1040
01:23:46,902 --> 01:23:48,153
Skip.

1041
01:23:48,612 --> 01:23:50,489
You want to call it quits,
turn around?

1042
01:23:51,740 --> 01:23:52,783
What do you think?

1043
01:23:54,743 --> 01:23:56,161
I think she's a hell of a boat.

1044
01:23:56,745 --> 01:23:58,038
With a hell of a crew.

1045
01:23:58,330 --> 01:23:59,665
And a hell of a skipper.

1046
01:24:02,125 --> 01:24:04,086
(RATTLES)

1047
01:24:04,461 --> 01:24:06,421
All right then, Gloucester...

1048
01:24:06,630 --> 01:24:08,048
...we're coming home!

1049
01:24:28,277 --> 01:24:29,528
Take the wheel!

1050
01:24:30,153 --> 01:24:31,113
Skipper, don't!

1051
01:24:31,321 --> 01:24:34,324
Take the goddamn wheel!
That's an order!

1052
01:24:45,085 --> 01:24:46,962
Damn, I can't see anything.

1053
01:24:53,468 --> 01:24:55,387
What's the gauge say?

1054
01:24:56,555 --> 01:24:59,349
It's low, Jonesy.
Where are they?

1055
01:24:59,558 --> 01:25:02,477
