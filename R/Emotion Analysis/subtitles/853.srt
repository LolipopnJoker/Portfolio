1
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,239
Up!

2
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,667
Still don't wanna talk?

3
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:24,960
Very well!

4
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:35,763
You will die a brutal death.

5
00:02:25,688 --> 00:02:28,357
- Keep this sucka steady, Toll!
- I'll do my best.

6
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,447
Here we go!!

7
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:44,832
Come on, you bastards!!

8
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,729
Eat shit!

9
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:19,617
- You better duck!
- Oh, shit!!

10
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,293
Yeah..

11
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:39,637
Turn around -

12
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:52,024
Brake!

13
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,413
- Watch your handling, slick!
- Shut up Gunner.

14
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:33,107
Incoming chopper!

15
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,819
We gotta get this thing outta here!

16
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,237
You got any ideas?

17
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:40,823
- That's what I'm asking you.
- Well I'm asking you!

18
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:48,789
Clear!

19
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:10,728
I got this.

20
00:05:57,107 --> 00:06:00,527
Think you're tough? Did your team arrive?

21
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:14,458
Toll Road, get 'em up.

22
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:24,510
- Trench?
- Oh, this is embarrassing.

23
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,513
- Yeah, sure is.
- What's he doing here?

24
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:29,848
Saving this Chinese billionaire.

25
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:32,768
Oh yeah? That's funny.
So are we.

26
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:35,396
Looks like we're in a sketchy problem,
aren't we?

27
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:38,023
Cut me loose!
Frankenstein.

28
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:39,441
Don't get nuts, Gunner.

29
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:40,692
Do it..

30
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:45,197
- Where's your team?
- Waiting.

31
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:48,784
I need a weapon, something big.
Yours!

32
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:52,454
My big weapons
hangin right where it is.

33
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,498
Come on, Caesar, you got a back-up.

34
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:59,461
If I don't get this back,
your ass is terminated.

35
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:00,754
In your dreams.

36
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:04,091
- Trench, We've got a way out.
- Thanks, I got my own.

37
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:07,219
- Let's get you out of here, pal.
- Hey look, I hate to break up the bromance.

38
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:09,638
We're 20 seconds late.

39
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,432
Get money bags UP!

40
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:12,724
A 'thank you' would be nice.

41
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:16,061
- I hate owing you.
- What'll you do, big boy??

42
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,484
Let's go, Yang!

43
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:24,111
You in?

44
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,571
Of course, I'm in.

45
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:27,990
Let's go!

46
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:38,792
I'm out.

47
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,088
Now you put on your lucky ring?

48
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,536
I got the gangbang right here!

49
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,394
I've got your back!

50
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:42,356
Keep moving!

51
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:45,859
- Oh shit!
- Here we go!

52
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:46,860
Geronimo!!

53
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,696
- Why always me?
- Are you hit?

54
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,240
Yeah, twice..

55
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:53,992
- Better you than me.
- That's nice, nice.

56
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,124
You order room service?

57
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:04,503
- Not really.
- Then this could be a pissy ending.

58
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,094
Not loaded?

59
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:14,137
We could only hope.

60
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,274
Sorry sir, I had to adjust for a windshift.

61
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:27,192
No problem, hit the last position.

62
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:28,485
Moving out, over.

63
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,197
Let's go.. go.. go!

64
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:20,495
OK, hold on ladies. The cavalry's here.

65
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,205
About time you got here!

66
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:26,084
- Wake up Sam.
- On it.

67
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:39,306
Shit!

68
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,241
This guy's good.

69
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:00,577
- You're good.
- Appreciate it, sir.

70
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,623
I swear I'll pick you up, Kid.

71
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,291
Won't be late, sir.

72
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:37,989
Alright guys, put your toys away.

73
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,551
Target in sight!

74
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:02,681
- Souped up!
- Fire...!

75
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,979
- You missed.
- You're aiming!

76
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:12,315
Fire!

77
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:18,864
Fire!

78
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:22,159
Fire!

79
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:37,632
That was a statement.

80
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,301
Hit it!

81
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:49,519
- Dump the ski!
- Come on, we need to lose weight!

82
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:56,985
Climb, baby!

83
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:08,705
Climb, baby!

84
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,797
Climb!

85
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:26,014
It ain't getting UP!

86
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:39,277
Lucky ring.

87
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,112
Lucky ring.

88
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:00,173
- How's the oil pressure?
- Bad..

89
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:03,593
- Great! And the altimeter?
- Can you believe it? Stuck at 10,000 ft.

90
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,679
- Hydraulics?
- What hydraulics?

91
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,181
Congratulations, you flew another piece of junk.

92
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:11,393
- Hey can we talk when you're not too busy?
- Sure, anytime.

93
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,271
- Kid's amazing.
- Really? So am I.

94
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:16,731
You're just used up.

95
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:19,651
Get the client ready!

96
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:26,074
- What is going on?
- Looks like you're taking a shortcut home, pal.

97
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:30,078
- Parachute good?
- Parachute?

98
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:31,746
Why are you gonna parachute?

99
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:34,791
Do you believe they changed
the landing party to tomorrow?

100
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,335
Yeah, it's OK, I'll get
home a little earlier.

101
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,963
- 15 seconds.
- Opening the hatch!

102
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,049
Yang, get money bags home safely.

103
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:46,177
- So when are you coming back?
- Maybe soon, maybe never.

104
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:48,138
Maybe try a new life.

105
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:52,851
- Then who am I supposed to pick on?
- You will find another minority.

106
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:56,187
Yang!
Smile...

107
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:01,568
See you later, alligator.

108
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:09,910
Now that's a real Chinese takeout.

109
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:18,418
- Floor it, I'm homesick.
- You got it.

110
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,102
Yes!
I love this song!

111
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:42,400
Christmas, my friend..

112
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,778
Please tell me you ain't
going through with this.

113
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:48,573
Course I am. Look at that girl,
who wouldn't marry her.

114
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:51,326
- She cheated on you.
- It was a half-cheat.

115
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:54,871
- Which is...
- The other side of her, half-truth.

116
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:57,874
Murky. I hate to break this to you, pal.

117
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:01,503
But your girlfriend over there
has a world-class cheating gene.

118
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,966
I should stab you in the heart.

119
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:06,967
Too late.

120
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:08,843
Hi..

121
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:12,389
You know I used to think
you had a black heart.

122
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:14,265
Black is too colorful.

123
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,393
- Hey babe!
- Hey!

124
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,521
- Hey Barney!
<i>-</i> Hey Lacy.

125
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:22,774
Promise next time not to
keep my baby away so long?

126
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,110
Cross my heart.

127
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:28,071
If he had one.

128
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,826
Look who's lost in space.

129
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:34,953
Got a pen?

130
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:40,500
Hey!

131
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:43,545
You got anything that doesn't
have skulls in it?

132
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:45,797
As a matter of fact, I don't.

133
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:02,397
Einstein's theory of spatial relativity.

134
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:05,066
But we have made it better.

135
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:12,323
Believe it or not, before Gunner
became chemically unbalanced,

136
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:16,161
he went to MIT and had a Master's
degree in chemical engineering.

137
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:18,413
This idiot actually had a
brain, can you believe that?

138
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:20,457
- What happened?
- He quit to be a bouncer.

139
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:23,710
I wanted to get close to this
girl and dance at this disco.

140
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,129
And I can't believe she dumped you.

141
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,506
- Wouldn't you?
- I would, yeah.

142
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:36,973
- Can we talk outside?
- Yeah, sure, let's go!

143
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,441
How do I put this...

144
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,985
Just be straight up, honest.

145
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,488
I feel, uh...

146
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:55,992
I'm not sure What I feel.

147
00:17:56,743 --> 00:18:00,288
This life...
it's not for you, is it?

148
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,208
I thought it was.

149
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:07,087
You gave me a chance to be one of you,
you got my respect forever.

150
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:09,089
And you got my respect too.

151
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:11,716
What are you gonna do?

152
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:15,136
I'd like to finish out the month.

153
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,388
Then I wanna go meet up my girlfriend.

154
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:19,265
Where's she from?

155
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:24,938
She's, uh, she's French. Believe it or not
I met her at Afghanistan, she was a nurse.

156
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,398
That comes in handy.

157
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,943
Yeah. You'd like her.

158
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:34,239
You know, she's the kind of person
you'd wanna do things for.

159
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:37,700
That's why I took this
job because the money's great..

160
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:40,370
Now I can afford to get
whatever that she deserves.

161
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,706
It's one of those things that just feels right.

162
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:48,753
I mean, you know when you could be with
someone and you don't even have to talk.

163
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:50,713
You already know what they're thinking.

164
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:52,132
You ever had that?

165
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,925
Sure.

166
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,639
I don't want you to think
that I'm deserting you.

167
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:00,765
No...

168
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:04,978
If I had to do it all over again at your age,

169
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:06,729
I'd do what you're doing.

170
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:10,483
Why don't you freshen up that beer.

171
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:12,569
Alright.

172
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:05,914
Barney Ross.

173
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:15,381
What do you want from me, Church?

174
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:18,718
Not too good on the memory
category are you, Barney?

175
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:23,139
You made a deal with me.

176
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,807
You gave me your word.

177
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:31,731
And you end up, blowing off half of Atlanta, punching
holes and a Bowie knife through a fellow CIA agent

178
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,233
even if he was a dirtbag.

179
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,777
But what breaks my heart,

180
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,739
is that you stole 5 million dollars from me.

181
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:48,831
And for all this male-patterned badness I gotta
put you in the deepest, darkest hole in Gitmo.

182
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,917
No sunlight.

183
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,711
- But I kept you out.
- Why?

184
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,715
Because I knew the day would come
when you were gonna pay me back.

185
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:00,802
Today is that day.

186
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:02,345
Keep talking.

187
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:07,475
Chinese plane got shot down over the
mountains near a hellhole called Gazak.

188
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:08,977
Yeah, who shot it down?

189
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,520
Take a guess.

190
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:16,734
Aboard that plane is a safe carrying
something you don't need to know about.

191
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:19,821
All you need to know is you can't
let it fall onto the wrong hands.

192
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:24,867
Now you're gonna get in there, you're gonna get
the contents of that safe, you're gonna bring it to me.

193
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,869
Should be a walk in the park for you.

194
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,080
And then we're even.

195
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:30,373
You get that?

196
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,377
The safe in that plane is very high-tech.

197
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:37,005
The access code changes every 120 seconds,

198
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:39,549
you use the wrong code, it blows.

199
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:41,426
- We need to get-
- Wait, Wait...!

200
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:43,136
We? Who's “we”? Who are you working with??

201
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:47,265
That's none of your business.
Let's just call our host The Corporation..

202
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:50,351
Alright? They're sending along a pro,

203
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:52,603
who specializes in this type of situation.

204
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:55,064
- Her name is Maggy Chan.
- A woman?

205
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:57,692
That usually goes along with the name Maggy, yeah.

206
00:21:57,692 --> 00:22:00,737
- Forget it.
- She can handle herself.

207
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:03,031
But let me be clear:

208
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:07,660
If anything happens to her,
She gets hanged there, she gets hurt,

209
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,622
she gets roughed up, she doesn't come back in
exactly the same condition she went in,

210
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:17,086
you and your little gang of psychotic
mutts will never be seen again.

211
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:20,715
And that, I promise you.

212
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:23,968
I don't make a very good babysitter.

213
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:30,183
You sound so sure.

214
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:41,569
You're gonna make a very good babysitter.

215
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:43,404
Be there at 7.

216
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:27,198
Hey. I'm Maggy Chan.

217
00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:28,449
You Barney Ross?

218
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:31,828
- Yeah.
- Mr. Church told you about me?

219
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,830
He said you wanna tag along.

220
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,207
Help, not tag along.

221
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:38,209
Nice motorcycle.

222
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:42,422
Where we're going, as you know,
we don't know what to expect.

223
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:44,132
Is it custom?

224
00:23:46,551 --> 00:23:49,137
I think it's a mistake, you coming along.

225
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:50,847
Build it yourself?

226
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,810
Yeah, I built it myself.
Are you playing games with me, Maggy?

227
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:56,853
No.

228
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:00,106
Are you playing games with me?

229
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:02,108
Church told me what you said.

230
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:03,818
I'm combat-proficient.

231
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:05,736
I don't need a babysitter.

232
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:10,616
So, when do we leave?

233
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:12,702
0500.

234
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:15,621
Nice meeting you.

235
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:58,498
She's into me.

236
00:24:58,873 --> 00:25:00,416
She hates you.

237
00:25:02,043 --> 00:25:03,127
Watch this.

238
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:37,370
You know if something happens to her,
it's coming back on us.

239
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:39,163
You ever think to ask me for my opinion?

240
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:43,543
I told you 10 times before, I didn't have a
choice unless you don't mind going to jail..

241
00:25:43,543 --> 00:25:46,337
- Yeah, well, Church intimidated you. Yeah.
- Really?

242
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:50,424
Is that the woman-you-can-never-
fully-trust calling again??

243
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:52,468
Yeah, I will stab you one day.

244
00:25:53,928 --> 00:25:58,057
Hey, baby.
Yeah, of course I'm thinking about you.

245
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:01,644
What else is there to think about?

246
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:04,814
Hopeless.

247
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:11,737
Hey.

248
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:14,699
You're in the army, right?

249
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:16,158
I can tell.

250
00:26:17,285 --> 00:26:22,081
Yes, ma'am.
3 years. Last tour was Afghanistan.

251
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,542
Didn't like it anymore?

252
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:26,794
It's a long story.

253
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:29,088
I would like to hear it.

254
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:31,173
Alright.

255
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:34,802
I, uh, was trained as a sniper...

256
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:39,807
and an instructor too but... I just really
wanna mix it up, you know, the action bit.

257
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:43,894
One time, we were stuck out in this hellhole valley.

258
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:47,773
About 30 Taliban opened up from these
houses in the hills above us.

259
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,526
They got about 8 of us pinned down bad.

260
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:54,405
So I called in for artillery support but,
“no way”, says the captain.

261
00:26:54,405 --> 00:26:56,616
Didn't want to endanger the locals.

262
00:26:56,616 --> 00:26:59,452
So we scattered, some crawled
through a ditch, some,

263
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:02,246
through a dry riverbed and the rest bailed, but...

264
00:27:02,622 --> 00:27:05,249
We were still stuck in the killzone.

265
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:09,920
And we battled for... I don't know, 3 hours?

266
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:13,132
And finally an apache gunship chopper

267
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:15,051
showed up to provide air cover.

268
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:17,094
Scattered the hajis but..

269
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:24,477
The smoke clears and four of my squad are
dead on the ditch and two on the riverbed.

270
00:27:32,735 --> 00:27:34,612
It's bad, sick...

271
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:37,198
All dead for nothing.

272
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:44,413
Do you know the most...
screwed up thing of all?

273
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:47,625
When I got back to base that night,
I found out that they had shot...

274
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:50,461
This stray dog that I adopted.

275
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:54,840
Commander's order's to get rid
of all animals on the base.

276
00:27:56,092 --> 00:27:59,261
I mean, think, we had enough
damn shooting for one day, you know?

277
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:06,769
Anyway.. I, figured it was time to move on.

278
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:10,064
I heard these guys were looking
for someone and here I am.

279
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:32,503
- You got that transponder?
- Yes, apparently, 15 km northwest.

280
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:33,671
Okay.

281
00:28:46,434 --> 00:28:47,643
Hello, darling..

282
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:49,729
Hello, darling..

283
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:51,605
We're a little busy...

284
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:54,358
- Right, let's move, wanna be outta here fast.
- The sooner, the better.

285
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:56,569
- Billy the Kid.
- Yeah?

286
00:28:56,736 --> 00:28:59,613
Today's your lucky day, you get to take point.

287
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:01,407
My pleasure, sir.

288
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:10,833
Impressive.

289
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:14,462
Hold on.

290
00:29:18,466 --> 00:29:20,092
Remember when you could do that?

291
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,469
No. Do you?

292
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:24,263
- I'd run away if I needed to.
- Really?

293
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:25,556
Look down.

294
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:30,186
Look down..
You see what I see'? Short legs.

295
00:29:30,186 --> 00:29:32,438
A thousand bucks, you can't catch him.

296
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,064
Come on, Flash!

297
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:37,193
- I'm a little busy.
- Oh, yeah..

298
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,461
Found the wreckage, spotted a hill, sir!

299
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:59,507
Slow down, Billy.
You're making us look bad.

300
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:01,258
Say again, over?

301
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:04,303
- You heard.
- Roger that, slowing down.

302
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:07,389
We appreciate it.

303
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:18,859
- Rest of the plane's over the hill, sir.
- Good work, Billy!

304
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:31,372
Looks like somebody had a bad day.

305
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:35,960
You guys, get to the right!

306
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,260
Piss off, you roamers.

307
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:51,016
Alright Billy, you get a vantage point up there.

308
00:30:56,689 --> 00:31:00,109
There's fur in the hands. This guy
was alive 'til the wolves got to him.

309
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:01,861
Be careful.

310
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:24,008
Is this it?

311
00:31:27,678 --> 00:31:29,138
Yes, it's here.

312
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:33,434
Caesar! I need you in here!

313
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:41,442
Caesar grab a hold of this thing,
I think it's spring loaded.

314
00:31:41,442 --> 00:31:42,943
Lee, hook it on.

315
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:45,779
Now on the count of three let's pull it back.

316
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:47,072
Ready?

317
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:52,453
One, two, three!

318
00:31:57,708 --> 00:31:58,626
We can't hold this!

319
00:31:58,626 --> 00:31:59,793
You have to.

320
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,015
Come on, Maggy!

321
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:15,893
Something's wrong.

322
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:18,854
- What?
- The explosive timer's triggered.

323
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:20,773
- How long?
- 54 seconds.

324
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:23,275
- If we leave now, we'll make it!
- Maggy, let it go!

325
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:24,944
No, I can do it!

326
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:29,281
- Come on, Maggy!
- Hey, What's going on?

327
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:32,242
She tripped the detonator, stay back!

328
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:39,708
I'm losing my grip.-

329
00:32:41,377 --> 00:32:43,504
You just, hold it..

330
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:49,635
Got it!

331
00:32:54,098 --> 00:32:56,308
Lucky I was here..

332
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:57,810
Just thinking that.

333
00:32:58,018 --> 00:33:00,604
I'm sorry, it's important I get this.

334
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:03,524
You got guts, no common sense.

335
00:33:03,524 --> 00:33:05,317
But guts. Come on.

336
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:08,570
It's alright, we got it, let's go.

337
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,613
You're strong.

338
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:12,992
Billy. Come on down, we're outta here.

339
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:15,411
What happened?

340
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:17,621
That woman is crazy, but I got a good pump.

341
00:33:25,129 --> 00:33:27,089
Aren't you curious about
what's inside the case?

342
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:29,591
No, I just wanna get Church off our backs.

343
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:30,926
Billy the Kid!

344
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:32,928
Where the hell is he?

345
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,929
Billy!

346
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:42,730
- Drop your weapons.
- No way.

347
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:44,314
Ain't happening.

348
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:46,442
No?

349
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:51,196
Are you sure?

350
00:33:58,037 --> 00:34:00,372
I'm sorry, sir, they were waiting.

351
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:03,417
- Drop the weapons now.
- Don't do it.

352
00:34:07,838 --> 00:34:09,840
He's a strong soldier.

353
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:12,217
Let's see how strong he is.

354
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:14,928
Do it.

355
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:21,769
No!

356
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:33,572
Don't do nothing he says!

357
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:37,868
Don't talk.

358
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:40,245
You should not speak.

359
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:45,542
- I'm gonna kill him.
- When I fire, his head,

360
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,044
will be gone.

361
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:52,216
- 3 seconds.
- Don't give your weapons, you don't owe me anything!

362
00:34:52,216 --> 00:34:53,217
1...

363
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:56,303
2...

364
00:34:57,846 --> 00:35:00,724
Don't do this! They'll kill everyone.

365
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:02,434
He's gonna kill him.

366
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:14,238
Drop them!!

367
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:20,744
I'm impressed. Very good use of intelligence.

368
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:25,249
Everybody stay calm, we'll be done soon.

369
00:35:25,249 --> 00:35:27,417
And then we will be on our way.

370
00:35:33,841 --> 00:35:35,259
Bring me that knife.

371
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:42,432
What's this symbol?

372
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,644
I like symbol.

373
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:52,568
This is the symbol of the goat.

374
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:56,572
The pet... of Satan.

375
00:35:58,574 --> 00:36:00,075
They say..

376
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:04,246
You have a case that belongs to me.

377
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:07,791
- Does it?
- Yes. Like your lives.

378
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:09,710
It's lost. He doesn't have it.

379
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,254
Last time, the case.

380
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:15,132
Or you will force me...

381
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:19,553
To cut..

382
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:23,182
His heart... out.

383
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:26,310
Do it, you piece of shit!

384
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,271
Wait!

385
00:36:34,193 --> 00:36:36,111
Let me have it.

386
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:53,003
Hey!

387
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:59,635
- You talking to me?
- Pick it up.

388
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:02,179
- Hand it to me.
- Humiliate yourself.

389
00:37:02,179 --> 00:37:04,431
- What was that?
- You heard..

390
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:12,564
Now pick it up..

391
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:15,108
...hand it to me nicely.

392
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:17,527
Or you will get what he got.

393
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:19,655
Do it, Lee.

394
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:33,043
You'll be alright, buddy.

395
00:37:41,051 --> 00:37:43,679
Respect is everything.

396
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:46,932
Without respect, we're just people...

397
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,643
...common, shitty people.

398
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:52,020
I'm sorry, sir.

399
00:37:52,813 --> 00:37:54,773
It's not your fault.

400
00:37:58,610 --> 00:37:59,945
Now what?

401
00:38:00,821 --> 00:38:03,240
We're both fighting men.

402
00:38:03,824 --> 00:38:10,998
And I respect that. And fighting men, they
don't deserve to be killed like sheep.

403
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,584
But...

404
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:23,677
Respect, must be taught.

405
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:29,474
Lie down with your face on the ground,

406
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:31,393
until we leave.

407
00:38:34,438 --> 00:38:36,189
Don't challenge me.

408
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:38,442
Get down.

409
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,631
Are you afraid of me?

410
00:39:02,049 --> 00:39:02,966
No.

411
00:39:03,425 --> 00:39:05,010
I'm not!

412
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:08,513
You should be.

413
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:34,539
- I'm dying.
- Don't talk, Billy.

414
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:35,832
Cut his hands loose.

415
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,835
Letter, in my pocket.

416
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:42,130
Okay kid, I got it.

417
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:44,591
I got it..

418
00:40:20,836 --> 00:40:22,337
I'm so sorry..

419
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:24,131
I blame you.

420
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:27,884
What was in the case?

421
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:33,306
A computer blueprint of a mine.

422
00:40:33,682 --> 00:40:34,891
A mine?

423
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:37,394
What mine?

424
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:44,860
The Russians stole nearly 5
tons of weapons grade Plutonium.

425
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:47,028
The mine was abandoned after the Cold War.

426
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:48,822
No one knows it's there.

427
00:40:48,822 --> 00:40:52,159
The blueprints show where the Plutonium is stored.

428
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:55,454
We have to stop it before it gets in the wrong hands.

429
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:57,706
Guess that didn't happen, did it?

430
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:02,669
This kid died so that some
dirtbag could make bombs.

431
00:41:05,881 --> 00:41:11,011
- I'm so sorry.
- Not as sorry as I am.

432
00:41:15,432 --> 00:41:17,017
Let's take care of him.

433
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:24,274
“Dear Sophia.

434
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:30,238
I wish I could find something different
to do besides just missing you...

435
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:31,615
...but I can't.

436
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:34,701
The team's treating me good.

437
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:37,621
We got each other's backs..

438
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:41,583
And I want you to know
that wherever I end up,

439
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:44,211
<i>I'll</i> be wanting the very best for you.

440
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:47,714
And if some miracle happens and I come back again,

441
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:51,218
I hope I'm still your man. Much love, Billy”.

442
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:56,515
Why is it that one of us...

443
00:41:56,723 --> 00:42:00,644
...who wants to live the most,
who deserves to live the most, dies.

444
00:42:00,644 --> 00:42:04,606
And the ones that deserve to die
keep on living.

445
00:42:05,524 --> 00:42:08,235
What's the message in that?

446
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:11,321
What's the plan?

447
00:42:12,322 --> 00:42:14,991
Track 'em, find 'em, kill 'em.

448
00:42:56,533 --> 00:42:59,536
CJ 1492 come up, requesting response immediately.

449
00:42:59,536 --> 00:43:00,787
Is this Bozo?..

450
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:04,499
CJ 1492 this is a secure airwave, do you read?

451
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:06,084
What's this about?

452
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:11,172
What's taking so long, Barney Ross? This should
have been a walk in the park for you guys.

453
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:14,342
- Where's the case?
- Don't have it.

454
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:18,054
I warned you what would happen to you
mutts if you pulled this shit again.

455
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:21,224
A good man died trying to get that case.

456
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:24,019
- I'm sorry about that.
- Oh, yeah?

457
00:43:24,019 --> 00:43:28,607
Yes, as a matter of fact, I am. Look, this sort of
situation comes with the territory, wouldn't you say?

458
00:43:28,607 --> 00:43:30,567
And so is payback.

459
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,946
You know, Church, you're that kind
of guy that pulls his strings

460
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:36,698
and everyone else does your dirty work

461
00:43:36,698 --> 00:43:41,578
because you've never had the
guts to do it yourself. We're done.

462
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:11,399
Sir, we got a problem.

463
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:13,276
The digging has slowed down.

464
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:14,569
Too many are dying,

465
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:15,862
and exhausted.

466
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:23,870
He's tired.

467
00:44:27,916 --> 00:44:30,043
Anybody else tired?

468
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:36,591
- Get more workers.
- Already taken most of the men from the villages.

469
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:38,593
Get all the rest.

470
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:41,554
Women, children, all of them.

471
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:56,236
Show me.

472
00:45:01,533 --> 00:45:03,743
Now we know where it is.

473
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:04,911
Right, right.

474
00:45:05,704 --> 00:45:08,039
Ok... I know what to do.

475
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:11,376
Good, I want the Plutonium all in 3 days.

476
00:45:13,253 --> 00:45:14,337
3 days?

477
00:45:14,504 --> 00:45:18,925
I have people, ready to pay 4 million a kilo, now.

478
00:45:19,718 --> 00:45:22,721
Three days. No more.

479
00:45:25,515 --> 00:45:29,060
Understood. 483 Yes, smart, imagine
if 6 pounds of pure Plutonium

480
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:32,272
is powerful enough to change
the balance of the world.

481
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:35,984
So imagine what 5 tons would do.

482
00:45:35,984 --> 00:45:37,861
It's very interesting.

483
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:49,372
- Something's happening.
- What?

484
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:51,458
The transmissions stopped.
They are underground

485
00:45:51,458 --> 00:45:53,501
I'm putting it down right here.

486
00:45:59,007 --> 00:46:01,426
Come on, let's hustle, hustle!
We gotta move!

487
00:46:03,303 --> 00:46:06,639
Christmas! Come on, Lee.
Do you even know what the hell you're doing?

488
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:08,933
5 minutes. Don't get your knickers in a twist.

489
00:46:27,744 --> 00:46:30,246
That transport truck, could be one of theirs.

490
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:32,373
Let's check this place out.

491
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:37,670
No shooting.

492
00:46:37,837 --> 00:46:39,839
- Classics?
- Yeah.

493
00:46:41,674 --> 00:46:43,384
I've been dying to use these.

494
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:45,845
We'll beat the truth out of them.

495
00:46:47,889 --> 00:46:49,724
Maggy, tell the guys to wait in the truck.

496
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:50,517
Okay.

497
00:47:04,697 --> 00:47:06,157
- They're here.
- Yeah.

498
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:20,338
You speak English?

499
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,932
- He's slightly gigantic.
- Shut up.

500
00:47:30,932 --> 00:47:32,308
Just saying.

501
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:43,820
- He's really gigantic.
- I said that!

502
00:47:56,291 --> 00:48:00,628
- Little bit of classics.
- I say we beat some info out of these guys and get moving.

503
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:02,964
- Sounds good to me.
- let's start with the midget.

504
00:48:02,964 --> 00:48:05,633
Calm down, boys. I can get them to talk

505
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:07,760
with much less effort.

506
00:48:10,346 --> 00:48:12,724
What are you gonna do, give them a pedicure?

507
00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:17,395
That's a little sick.

508
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:20,648
Christmas, I need you to hotwire that truck
and go back to the plane and get the weapons.

509
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:23,693
- She get one of those if she sends you to do it.
- Stop complaining.

510
00:48:23,693 --> 00:48:25,862
I should have bashed one of these up on your skull-

511
00:48:25,904 --> 00:48:28,865
- How did it go?
- We're on, let's move!

512
00:48:33,578 --> 00:48:38,207
They call themselves Sangs, they say they
control everything east of the mountains.

513
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:40,919
Robbery, kidnapping, assassinations.

514
00:48:40,919 --> 00:48:43,379
Basically a cartel for hire.

515
00:48:43,379 --> 00:48:46,716
- How do you know the language?
- Easy, put it together.

516
00:48:46,716 --> 00:48:50,219
It's a cross between Ukraine
and Bulgarian dialect.

517
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:51,721
Impressed?

518
00:48:53,056 --> 00:48:54,098
A little.

519
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:58,478
- Christmas!
- What?

520
00:48:58,519 --> 00:48:59,354
Why are you yelling?

521
00:48:59,354 --> 00:49:01,272
Because you gave me the shit job, that's why.

522
00:49:01,564 --> 00:49:04,025
<i>I'll</i> shoot you in the face when I see you.

523
00:49:04,192 --> 00:49:07,779
- Where are you?
- The 60-year old death-trap you call a plane.

524
00:49:07,779 --> 00:49:09,572
What's taking you so long?

525
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:13,743
Because there's bridges out, signs missing, I've been
driving in these damn roads for the last 7 hours!

526
00:49:13,743 --> 00:49:16,913
- You done complaining?
- Thanks for the sympathy.

527
00:49:40,103 --> 00:49:41,270
This is Weird.

528
00:49:43,856 --> 00:49:45,566
It's like home.

529
00:49:50,822 --> 00:49:52,448
What the hell is this place?

530
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:55,034
I believe it's an old Soviet army base.

531
00:49:55,243 --> 00:49:57,036
Probably used in the '80s,

532
00:49:57,036 --> 00:49:58,079
The Cold War.

533
00:49:58,621 --> 00:50:02,750
They most likely staged maneuvers and
practiced attacks against the US here.

534
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:05,378
Is there anything you don't know?

535
00:50:16,139 --> 00:50:19,809
Great, just what I need, 50-year old pizza.

536
00:50:24,981 --> 00:50:27,108
We'll bed down here for the night.

537
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:48,212
This tastes like shit. How's yours?

538
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:50,506
Can't complain about Rigatoni.

539
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:53,051
Dine ahead, fellas.

540
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:58,264
That's all I have to say. Hell,
what if you knew you were gonna die tomorrow?

541
00:50:58,264 --> 00:51:00,099
What would your last meal be?

542
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:02,143
- One choice.
- One choice?

543
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:05,646
- Probably cereal for you, huh?
- Well, what the hell is wrong with cereal?

544
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:06,564
It's cliché.

545
00:51:07,023 --> 00:51:11,235
You gotta be original, you know, if you
were an original, broad-thinking man,

546
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:13,529
you'd probably come up with some special cereal

547
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:15,782
like Eareal, you know, just like your ear...

548
00:51:15,782 --> 00:51:19,160
Pour milk on those suckas and just lay
it in, and you don't wanna eat shit..

549
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:23,247
For the record, my hearing is 20/20.

550
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:24,540
Barney?

551
00:51:25,374 --> 00:51:27,460
Donuts and most food that kills you.

552
00:51:29,921 --> 00:51:33,299
- That's deep, man.
- I think so.

553
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:34,258
Maggy?

554
00:51:35,093 --> 00:51:37,053
Crispy aromatic duck.

555
00:51:37,053 --> 00:51:39,055
With plum sauce.

556
00:51:39,305 --> 00:51:41,099
Very sexy.

557
00:51:43,726 --> 00:51:46,229
But I like Italian, too.

558
00:51:48,106 --> 00:51:51,109
I'm starting to think Italian’s overrated.

559
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:58,616
Hey. What about me?

560
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:05,289
My very Swedish dinner would be...

561
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,208
Baby seal,

562
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:09,377
and whale ass..

563
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:12,713
...In the summer.

564
00:52:13,965 --> 00:52:19,554
Bu I'd really die, for some Chinese.

565
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:27,353
Then you're gonna starve to death.

566
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:30,231
Alright, sweet dreams.

567
00:52:30,231 --> 00:52:33,109
Hey, Barney, I'm not done eating man.

568
00:52:55,840 --> 00:53:00,052
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure, go ahead.

569
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:04,015
Why are you so nervous around me?

570
00:53:05,183 --> 00:53:07,768
I don't get nervous, Maggy.

571
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:09,187
What is it then?

572
00:53:09,896 --> 00:53:12,815
I just like keeping a distance.

573
00:53:13,399 --> 00:53:16,402
Is it because you don't
want to know any more people?

574
00:53:16,444 --> 00:53:19,113
Let's just say that bad things have happened to people

575
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:20,907
I've come in close to.

576
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:24,368
Not a good way to live.

577
00:53:25,661 --> 00:53:26,871
I know.

578
00:53:29,123 --> 00:53:31,959
Do you think about the young man who died?

579
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,795
All the time.

580
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:38,341
You don't talk about him much.

581
00:53:38,341 --> 00:53:41,052
No, 'cause it's how we deal with death.

582
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:43,971
Can't change what it is so we keep it light

583
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:46,098
until it's time to get dark.

584
00:53:46,098 --> 00:53:48,517
And then we get pitch black.

585
00:53:49,477 --> 00:53:50,811
Understand?

586
00:53:51,229 --> 00:53:53,272
I understand.

587
00:53:57,235 --> 00:53:58,861
Goodnight.

588
00:54:03,491 --> 00:54:04,784
Goodnight, Maggy-

589
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:33,729
I swear to God, if he won't
stop snoring I'm gonna shoot him.

590
00:54:35,231 --> 00:54:36,232
Gunner!

591
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:40,736
You riding?

592
00:54:46,117 --> 00:54:49,912
I know it's a stupid question, I don't
suppose you have any more of that coffee?

593
00:54:49,912 --> 00:54:54,083
- Only makes one cup.
- Yeah, that's what I figured.

594
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:59,255
Listen up! This guy said that a congregation
of Sangs are probably in this area.

595
00:54:59,255 --> 00:55:00,965
Concentrated east.

596
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:03,009
So that's where we're going.

597
00:55:03,009 --> 00:55:04,635
We're out of here in 10 minutes.

598
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,971
Be ready, do what you got to do.

599
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:37,835
- We got to get out of here!
- Go!

600
00:55:38,169 --> 00:55:39,670
Go, go, go!

601
00:55:58,689 --> 00:56:00,066
Save your ammo.

602
00:56:03,694 --> 00:56:04,904
Where the hell are you?

603
00:56:05,029 --> 00:56:06,405
I'm almost there!

604
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:09,116
What's going on, are those shots?

605
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:10,785
Yeah!

606
00:56:13,579 --> 00:56:15,706
- What's happening?
- The Sang's got us pinned down.

607
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:18,167
- Can you hold them off?
- Yeah, maybe with a tank.

608
00:56:18,959 --> 00:56:21,295
- Oh, shit.
- What?

609
00:56:23,047 --> 00:56:26,050
They got a tank. Come on, come on!

610
00:56:35,226 --> 00:56:37,228
Let's roll, come on!

611
00:56:44,443 --> 00:56:45,444
I'm out.

612
00:56:46,987 --> 00:56:49,115
One left. Why not??

613
00:57:05,297 --> 00:57:08,759
- Hey who did that?
- Not me, I'm out!

614
00:57:18,686 --> 00:57:20,354
What just happened?

615
00:57:21,814 --> 00:57:23,482
Somebody got a little carried away.

616
00:57:23,482 --> 00:57:26,735
- Looks that way.
- Where're the shooters?

617
00:57:26,735 --> 00:57:30,573
I don't know, but if they had
wanted us dead, we'd be dead.

618
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:33,409
Barney.

619
00:57:49,383 --> 00:57:50,801
Don't freak out.

620
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:02,730
- Small world, huh, Barney?
- Booker.

621
00:58:03,939 --> 00:58:07,276
- Rumor has it, you were dead.
- Yeah, I heard that too.

622
00:58:07,276 --> 00:58:10,154
- So how's life treating you?
- Been better.

623
00:58:10,571 --> 00:58:12,406
You did all this?

624
00:58:12,573 --> 00:58:14,492
I fight solo, I thought you knew that?

625
00:58:14,492 --> 00:58:16,410
Yeah, I heard but I didn't buy it.

626
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:18,370
Well now you do.

627
00:58:19,455 --> 00:58:21,790
- This your team?
- Yeah..

628
00:58:21,916 --> 00:58:25,920
Gunner, Toll Road,
Hale Caesar and Maggy.

629
00:58:26,212 --> 00:58:27,588
Booker?

630
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:30,049
You're the one people
call the “Lone Wolf”?

631
00:58:30,049 --> 00:58:31,592
I've been called that.

632
00:58:31,884 --> 00:58:33,636
But I have mellowed.

633
00:58:36,764 --> 00:58:38,474
Not that much.

634
00:58:39,767 --> 00:58:41,435
I heard another rumor

635
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:43,812
that you were bitten by a King Cobra?

636
00:58:43,812 --> 00:58:48,275
Yeah, I was. But after five
days of agonizing pain,

637
00:58:48,943 --> 00:58:50,402
The cobra died.

638
00:58:58,744 --> 00:59:01,247
Hey Booker, great to see you.

639
00:59:01,497 --> 00:59:04,667
- So how'd you wind up in this godforsaken place?
- Yeah, we got ambushed by Sang

640
00:59:04,667 --> 00:59:07,044
about a 100 km east of here,
killed one of my men,

641
00:59:07,044 --> 00:59:08,921
- a young kid.
- Yeah, sorry to hear that.

642
00:59:08,921 --> 00:59:09,838
Yeah..

643
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:11,924
The Sans are the lowest form of scum.

644
00:59:11,924 --> 00:59:13,759
Shooting them have been a good business.

645
00:59:13,759 --> 00:59:15,844
- You know who the leader is?
- Yeah a guy named Vilain.

646
00:59:15,844 --> 00:59:17,179
Vilain?

647
00:59:17,221 --> 00:59:19,890
Yeah, he pretty much controls
everything in this area.

648
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:22,643
You're gonna need more men if
you'd expect to get out alive.

649
00:59:22,685 --> 00:59:23,727
Can you help out?

650
00:59:23,727 --> 00:59:27,231
- Sorry, Barney. I work alone.
- I understand.

651
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:29,525
- Thanks for showing up.
- My pleasure.

652
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:39,326
Hey Barney, there's a village
down the road. There are good people,

653
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:42,454
and they hate the Sangs. Maybe they can help out.

654
00:59:42,454 --> 00:59:44,999
- Thanks!
- Happy hunting!

655
00:59:53,799 --> 00:59:54,967
What happened?

656
00:59:55,301 --> 00:59:56,594
I'm still alive.

657
00:59:56,594 --> 00:59:58,095
It's a matter of opinion, what did I miss?

658
00:59:58,095 --> 01:00:01,265
<i>I'll</i> tell you all about it on the way.
Come on guys, unload these weapons.

659
01:00:01,265 --> 01:00:03,809
Looks like Christmas came way late this year.

660
01:00:03,809 --> 01:00:07,354
- Yeah I love you, too.
- Well, I'm happy to see you.

661
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:10,107
Finally. Somebody with class.

662
01:00:18,073 --> 01:00:20,367
It's got to be the town
that Booker was talking about.

663
01:00:20,659 --> 01:00:22,995
I could retire to a place like this.

664
01:00:25,414 --> 01:00:28,959
Clean air, no stress, raise some kids.

665
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:31,670
You know, Maggy, I could retire
to a pace like this.

666
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:33,631
You are so full of shit.

667
01:00:46,018 --> 01:00:47,811
They're missing us by a mile.

668
01:00:49,438 --> 01:00:52,358
- Put down guns.
- That's not happening!

669
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:56,862
Safest place is in front of their gun.

670
01:00:56,904 --> 01:00:59,323
- We will shoot you!
- No!

671
01:00:59,823 --> 01:01:01,116
Wait.

672
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:04,745
These guys are here to help.

673
01:01:04,787 --> 01:01:06,789
They want to help.

674
01:01:21,178 --> 01:01:23,472
Even you two rejects could
get lucky around here.

675
01:01:23,472 --> 01:01:25,307
- You think?
- I doubt it.

676
01:01:25,307 --> 01:01:26,475
Do you mind?

677
01:01:28,894 --> 01:01:31,980
- Who you are?
- We're American.

678
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:34,066
- Swedish.
- Blackford.

679
01:01:34,066 --> 01:01:36,276
- Chinese.
- Retards.

680
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:37,986
Are you done?

681
01:01:39,738 --> 01:01:41,407
What do you want?

682
01:01:41,824 --> 01:01:44,326
We are here to take care of The Sangs.

683
01:01:49,748 --> 01:01:50,791
Okay.

684
01:01:51,125 --> 01:01:52,292
Come inside.

685
01:01:54,670 --> 01:01:55,504
Come on.

686
01:02:05,681 --> 01:02:08,058
This is who we'd think you've come for.

687
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:10,352
This is who we will die for.

688
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:16,233
First, they told us there'd be good jobs, good money.

689
01:02:16,984 --> 01:02:20,154
Some went, but nobody come back.

690
01:02:20,154 --> 01:02:25,242
They come for more. They say as
soon as our men go to job,

691
01:02:25,826 --> 01:02:27,786
the others come home.

692
01:02:29,204 --> 01:02:33,917
My husband goes. For a long time we hear nothing.

693
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:35,043
Then...

694
01:02:35,627 --> 01:02:38,964
...the Sangs come and they take
all of the rest of the men.

695
01:02:39,214 --> 01:02:42,801
Force them to work in the mines.
Same in the next village.

696
01:02:42,843 --> 01:02:46,346
And the next, they take my sons.

697
01:02:46,555 --> 01:02:49,266
Now all that is left, are the very young.

698
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:51,101
And they will be back for them, too.

699
01:02:51,143 --> 01:02:51,769
I know this.

700
01:02:51,769 --> 01:02:54,605
- We all know this.
- So we hide them,

701
01:02:54,605 --> 01:02:58,066
- and we wait.
- Why don't you just move on?

702
01:02:58,066 --> 01:03:00,819
- Leave.
- This is our home.

703
01:03:00,944 --> 01:03:03,739
Our lives will be the last thing they'll take.

704
01:03:05,824 --> 01:03:07,576
Tell us why you're here now.

705
01:03:07,743 --> 01:03:09,495
We're tracking them.

706
01:03:10,078 --> 01:03:11,205
Can't you stay?

707
01:03:11,205 --> 01:03:14,291
And help? You saw the children!

708
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:17,085
Soon they'll be damned and they'll kill them all.

709
01:03:17,085 --> 01:03:19,338
We have our own business with them.

710
01:03:22,633 --> 01:03:23,634
Sorry..

711
01:03:24,384 --> 01:03:25,302
Let's go!

712
01:03:33,602 --> 01:03:35,312
I don't think they're
gonna last here much longer.

713
01:03:35,312 --> 01:03:37,064
I think they know that.

714
01:03:37,105 --> 01:03:38,774
So we're not gonna do anything about it?

715
01:03:41,235 --> 01:03:42,569
I have an idea.

716
01:03:43,153 --> 01:03:45,280
And with your ego I think
you're gonna love it.

717
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:46,907
- My ego?
- Your ego.

718
01:03:46,949 --> 01:03:49,201
- What you mean my ego?
- You got a big ego.

719
01:03:49,827 --> 01:03:53,330
- Check your ego out!
- Please, your ego is like the size of a dinosaur.

720
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:54,373
It's huge.

721
01:04:04,132 --> 01:04:05,342
We got it.

722
01:04:05,342 --> 01:04:07,386
We found the Plutonium.

723
01:04:24,236 --> 01:04:27,364
Eva.. The Sangs are coming! Warn everyone!

724
01:04:38,959 --> 01:04:40,419
Search all the houses!

725
01:04:40,919 --> 01:04:42,212
Keep on looking!

726
01:04:43,797 --> 01:04:45,215
Lari...!
Lari...!

727
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:21,293
Show us where the kid is, priest.

728
01:05:21,668 --> 01:05:23,962
And get out of our way.

729
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:26,924
By the power vested in me..

730
01:05:27,049 --> 01:05:29,509
I now pronounce you...

731
01:05:29,927 --> 01:05:31,386
...man and knife.

732
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:44,710
One more!

733
01:06:48,922 --> 01:06:50,716
Rest in pieces.

734
01:07:00,017 --> 01:07:02,019
- Is this the last one?
- Yes.

735
01:07:02,185 --> 01:07:03,228
Good.

736
01:07:11,403 --> 01:07:12,904
Chambers are cleared.

737
01:07:21,747 --> 01:07:22,998
Now a good sentence.

738
01:07:24,166 --> 01:07:26,084
You bury them all.

739
01:07:35,302 --> 01:07:37,220
I see about a dozen guards.

740
01:07:37,637 --> 01:07:40,599
Light weapons, couple of badass 50 cals.

741
01:07:40,599 --> 01:07:44,311
Worse, anti-tank devices.

742
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:47,481
There's no way our trucks
will get through that minefield.

743
01:07:48,774 --> 01:07:52,736
Look, I know this is a stupid question, but
you got any ideas so we won't get killed<i>'?</i>

744
01:07:53,612 --> 01:07:55,781
I got a few I'm thinking about.

745
01:08:30,941 --> 01:08:33,318
- Boom time?
- Boom time!

746
01:08:45,831 --> 01:08:47,499
Target in sight!

747
01:08:48,792 --> 01:08:50,418
Baby wants to travel!

748
01:08:50,418 --> 01:08:51,211
Fire!

749
01:08:53,421 --> 01:08:54,965
- Rock and roll!
- Fire!

750
01:08:57,509 --> 01:08:59,052
Bombs away!

751
01:09:06,726 --> 01:09:09,146
- Tighten up.
- What's happening now?!

752
01:09:09,146 --> 01:09:10,188
Chaos!

753
01:09:11,148 --> 01:09:13,859
- You're not doing what I think you're doing!
- Yeah, I am!

754
01:09:14,151 --> 01:09:15,694
Let's do it!

755
01:09:19,281 --> 01:09:20,866
Come on, let's move!

756
01:09:46,558 --> 01:09:48,560
You're gonna need a new plane.

757
01:09:54,441 --> 01:09:56,943
We'll be home soon...

758
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:10,540
- We are too late!!
- What?!

759
01:10:10,582 --> 01:10:11,333
The Plutonium is gone!

760
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:20,383
Come on, come on, get out of here!

761
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:25,263
- Go, go, go.
- Move it, move it!

762
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:29,059
Come on, get out of here!

763
01:10:51,831 --> 01:10:54,084
We're gonna be here a while.

764
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:04,844
Doesn't seem right.

765
01:11:04,928 --> 01:11:06,388
Going out this chickenshit way?

766
01:11:06,388 --> 01:11:08,181
Yeah, something like that.

767
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:11,851
Hey! It ain't over
yet, kids. I got a plan.

768
01:11:12,185 --> 01:11:13,812
Everybody calm down.

769
01:11:18,108 --> 01:11:19,776
Phosphate rock.

770
01:11:20,026 --> 01:11:22,946
- What is he doing?
- Probably making a bomb.

771
01:11:23,029 --> 01:11:25,740
- You serious?
- Ask him.

772
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:31,997
- What you doing, Gunner?
- I'm making a bomb. You mind?

773
01:11:32,998 --> 01:11:36,376
- A maniac with brains.
- Scary.

774
01:11:36,376 --> 01:11:39,629
Phosphate rock, got a density of 1.52,

775
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:41,881
melting point 44.2 centigrade.

776
01:11:41,881 --> 01:11:44,718
Guys! I want some gunpowder, fast!

777
01:11:44,718 --> 01:11:46,886
Do it! The man's a chemical engineer, right?

778
01:11:46,886 --> 01:11:48,096
And a full-pledged scholar.

779
01:11:48,888 --> 01:11:51,057
Pour it in the pipe.

780
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:53,226
Big man might be onto something.

781
01:11:53,226 --> 01:11:55,520
- You think?
- Probably not.

782
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:57,355
Need some help with that, let's go!

783
01:11:57,355 --> 01:11:59,190
Here you go, blow yourself up.

784
01:11:59,441 --> 01:12:00,817
Lighter.

785
01:12:02,319 --> 01:12:04,321
I want that back.

786
01:12:04,612 --> 01:12:07,240
Better get back! This is gonna be loud!

787
01:12:11,244 --> 01:12:12,454
Get back!

788
01:12:13,997 --> 01:12:17,500
Okay, alright, let's go!

789
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:22,839
Better turn around unless
you want your heads blown up.

790
01:12:23,298 --> 01:12:25,008
Better cover your ears.

791
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:40,565
- All the phosphate's must've been damp.
- Yeah, right.

792
01:12:40,607 --> 01:12:43,485
- Or you suck.
- there's that.

793
01:12:43,485 --> 01:12:45,945
Don't cry, Gunner.

794
01:12:46,738 --> 01:12:49,366
You almost had an idea.

795
01:13:14,474 --> 01:13:16,309
I'm back!

796
01:13:17,227 --> 01:13:19,479
How you doing, Trench?

797
01:13:24,234 --> 01:13:27,779
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

798
01:13:59,352 --> 01:14:02,689
- We're even now, right?
- Right.

799
01:14:02,689 --> 01:14:05,358
I'll be seeing you around, Trench. Thanks a lot.

800
01:14:05,358 --> 01:14:08,153
Relax, it's not over yet.

801
01:14:08,153 --> 01:14:10,113
- What?
- That's right.

802
01:14:16,870 --> 01:14:19,998
- How you doing, pal?
- Pretty good, Church, what're you doing here?

803
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:22,792
- Heard there's a party in town.
- Yeah, but it's my party.

804
01:14:23,001 --> 01:14:25,295
Has he always been this selfish?

805
01:14:25,295 --> 01:14:27,297
- Always.
- Thanks.

806
01:14:31,968 --> 01:14:34,596
You wanna kick Vilain's ass or not?

807
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:37,182
Don't forget the little rascal!

808
01:15:00,622 --> 01:15:01,623
Move it.

809
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:10,191
Take the rest of the
nukes to the hangar, now!

810
01:16:10,316 --> 01:16:12,485
And get the Plutonium on the plane.

811
01:16:21,578 --> 01:16:22,495
Follow me.

812
01:16:25,164 --> 01:16:27,041
We need to buy some time.

813
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:14,964
I'm out!

814
01:17:27,185 --> 01:17:29,354
Go.. go! Move!

815
01:17:50,625 --> 01:17:51,834
- Fun, huh?
- Yeah.

816
01:17:52,126 --> 01:17:53,670
Oh, there he is!

817
01:17:55,338 --> 01:17:56,172
Let's go!

818
01:17:56,464 --> 01:17:58,549
- Yeah!
- Tear him apart!

819
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:18,319
I'm almost out!

820
01:18:18,403 --> 01:18:19,445
I'll be back.

821
01:18:19,654 --> 01:18:21,239
You've been back enough.

822
01:18:21,406 --> 01:18:22,573
I'll be back.

823
01:18:23,491 --> 01:18:24,992
Yippee-ki-yay.

824
01:18:30,456 --> 01:18:32,583
Who's next? Rambo?

825
01:18:37,714 --> 01:18:38,840
Good bye!

826
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:43,052
Let's go.

827
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:47,432
Maggots.

828
01:19:04,073 --> 01:19:07,493
Start the engine. Get this thing in
the air. I want to make some money!

829
01:19:07,618 --> 01:19:08,286
Move!

830
01:19:14,417 --> 01:19:16,210
Trench! Get in!

831
01:19:20,465 --> 01:19:22,759
My shoe is bigger than this car.

832
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:26,012
Shoot something!

833
01:19:57,084 --> 01:19:58,503
Start the helicopter.

834
01:19:58,711 --> 01:20:00,588
We have a special guest coming!

835
01:20:02,548 --> 01:20:03,758
Let's go!

836
01:20:20,233 --> 01:20:21,567
Take care of him!

837
01:21:43,190 --> 01:21:45,318
Can't beat the Classic.

838
01:21:58,664 --> 01:22:01,167
- Barney!
- What are you doing here?

839
01:22:04,754 --> 01:22:08,424
Now I'm going there alone, don't follow
me no matter what, you understand?

840
01:22:09,258 --> 01:22:11,552
- You understand?
- Yes.

841
01:22:13,262 --> 01:22:16,557
If that door opens up and
I don't come out, and he does,

842
01:22:16,807 --> 01:22:18,225
you kill him.

843
01:22:25,566 --> 01:22:27,234
Let's make it more dramatic!

844
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:31,614
Now that's better!

845
01:22:47,171 --> 01:22:48,589
I'm out of bullets!

846
01:22:48,589 --> 01:22:49,966
That's your problem.

847
01:22:51,050 --> 01:22:52,343
Not really.

848
01:22:59,558 --> 01:23:01,727
You wanna kill me like a man?

849
01:23:04,855 --> 01:23:06,732
Or you wanna kill me...

850
01:23:10,111 --> 01:23:11,487
like a sheep?

851
01:23:32,466 --> 01:23:34,135
Nice knife.

852
01:23:49,358 --> 01:23:50,192
So...

853
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:53,112
What is it going to be?

854
01:23:56,949 --> 01:23:59,201
Man or sheep?

855
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:01,537
You wanna man up?

856
01:24:03,122 --> 01:24:05,166
I'll man you up.

857
01:24:18,387 --> 01:24:21,140
You must want to hurt me bad.

858
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:23,225
I'm not gonna hurt you.

859
01:24:23,976 --> 01:24:26,353
I'm gonna take your life.

860
01:24:28,606 --> 01:24:29,607
Come..

861
01:24:54,423 --> 01:24:56,342
Over so soon?

862
01:24:56,342 --> 01:24:58,844
I want my money's worth!

863
01:24:59,011 --> 01:25:01,555
- Come on, get UP!
- Coming right Up!

864
01:25:17,196 --> 01:25:18,864
Tastes good?

865
01:25:19,323 --> 01:25:20,866
Talking to me?

866
01:25:53,482 --> 01:25:54,233
Ironic.

867
01:25:55,067 --> 01:25:56,986
Here we are, you and I.

868
01:25:57,528 --> 01:25:58,946
And your knife.

869
01:26:01,323 --> 01:26:02,908
You're going to die.

870
01:26:03,576 --> 01:26:04,743
Like him.

871
01:26:06,162 --> 01:26:07,663
What was his name?

872
01:26:09,957 --> 01:26:11,500
What did you call him?

873
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:16,505
What does it matter?

874
01:26:20,092 --> 01:26:21,719
Come on, Vilain.

875
01:26:22,261 --> 01:26:24,138
Somebody's dying.

876
01:26:24,138 --> 01:26:25,222
Come on!

877
01:26:28,601 --> 01:26:32,479
Come on, Vilain! Come on!

878
01:26:56,337 --> 01:26:58,005
Berdiri Vilain.

879
01:27:02,051 --> 01:27:05,346
Get... up!

880
01:27:10,893 --> 01:27:13,729
Now turn around.

881
01:27:13,979 --> 01:27:16,398
Turn around, sheep!

882
01:27:28,661 --> 01:27:29,828
Now, Wham?

883
01:27:38,837 --> 01:27:40,881
His name was Billy.

884
01:28:01,151 --> 01:28:03,487
We oughta go to Turkey (?).

885
01:28:11,161 --> 01:28:13,664
- Did you win?
- I think so.

886
01:28:14,290 --> 01:28:15,833
Well, where's the proof?

887
01:28:17,501 --> 01:28:19,336
Head's up.

888
01:28:24,383 --> 01:28:25,926
Nice touch.

889
01:28:28,137 --> 01:28:30,139
It is a nice touch.

890
01:28:30,723 --> 01:28:32,224
A little extreme.

891
01:28:32,558 --> 01:28:33,892
But nice.

892
01:28:37,563 --> 01:28:39,732
As much as I hate to say this, Bam-Bam,

893
01:28:39,898 --> 01:28:41,984
now that we got control of the Plutonium,

894
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:44,320
that makes us even.

895
01:28:44,361 --> 01:28:45,446
Good.

896
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:49,158
So Maggy you'll be coming with us, then?

897
01:28:51,493 --> 01:28:52,911
When you're ready.

898
01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:01,420
So I just want..

899
01:29:12,181 --> 01:29:14,725
You're OK, just a little immature.

900
01:29:16,852 --> 01:29:18,687
I don't have to go.

901
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:21,523
If you want me to stay, <i>I'll</i> stay.

902
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:26,320
And I did save a babysitter's life.

903
01:29:26,904 --> 01:29:28,322
That you did do.

904
01:29:28,697 --> 01:29:30,366
Maybe I'm good luck for you.

905
01:29:30,866 --> 01:29:33,827
But I can be bad luck for you
and I can't allow that.

906
01:29:38,207 --> 01:29:40,292
If you ever want help,

907
01:29:41,043 --> 01:29:44,171
call me. Or you're dead.

908
01:29:44,463 --> 01:29:46,090
I'll do that.

909
01:29:55,557 --> 01:29:57,476
What are you doing here?

910
01:29:58,143 --> 01:30:00,687
Moving on, you killed all my business.

911
01:30:00,687 --> 01:30:02,815
I thought you were the “Lone Wolf'.

912
01:30:04,316 --> 01:30:06,610
Sometimes it's fun to run with the pack.

913
01:30:06,610 --> 01:30:09,780
You got a point. You take care, Maggy.

914
01:30:17,579 --> 01:30:22,126
Oh, I almost forgot. As a token of my
gratitude, my violent friend,

915
01:30:22,126 --> 01:30:25,295
I got you, and the little rascals a ride home.

916
01:30:27,089 --> 01:30:28,257
Behold!

917
01:30:28,799 --> 01:30:29,883
What?

918
01:30:33,262 --> 01:30:34,930
Consider it a gift.

919
01:30:36,890 --> 01:30:39,393
That thing belongs in a museum.

920
01:30:39,601 --> 01:30:40,978
We all do.

921
01:30:42,688 --> 01:30:45,274
- Hey. Fun, right?
- Yeah. Fun.

922
01:30:46,442 --> 01:30:47,776
Take care.

923
01:31:57,346 --> 01:31:58,388
To Billy!

924
01:31:59,306 --> 01:32:00,682
To Billy!

925
01:32:00,807 --> 01:32:01,558
To Billy!
