1
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,741
Thing of beauty.

2
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:22,084
Good morning. sir!

3
00:03:22,256 --> 00:03:25,089
Yet another on-time delivery from--

4
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:27,750
Get the hell out of my face. canner.

5
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,096
Have a nice day!

6
00:03:32,533 --> 00:03:37,027
And we believe our Destination Anywhere
package to be the best value.

7
00:03:37,238 --> 00:03:42,437
Let us take you to your dream destination
aboard our orbital spaceplane, the X-82.

8
00:03:47,014 --> 00:03:52,452
Try Jazztown's synthetic Chicago-style
pizza. Tastes as good as you remember.

9
00:03:53,554 --> 00:03:56,785
Glowfish! The world's hottest-selling
transgenic treats.

10
00:03:56,957 --> 00:04:00,518
Your children will love the new colors too!

11
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:03,729
-Excuse me. sir.
-Total performance.

12
00:04:03,898 --> 00:04:06,389
Total readiness. Total security.

13
00:04:06,567 --> 00:04:08,865
So goodbye to upgrades
and service calls.

14
00:04:09,036 --> 00:04:11,129
An uplink to USR's central computer...

15
00:04:11,305 --> 00:04:14,741
...provides this state-of-the-art robot
with new programs daily.

16
00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:18,140
The Nestor Class 5
is tomorrow's robot today.

17
00:04:18,913 --> 00:04:21,347
Spoon! Spoonie!

18
00:04:25,286 --> 00:04:28,813
Hold up. Hold on!
Excuse me. excuse me.

19
00:04:28,989 --> 00:04:31,480
-Spoon. where you been at?
-Just away. Farber.

20
00:04:31,659 --> 00:04:34,526
Oh. yeah. away? Like vacation?
That's nice.

21
00:04:34,728 --> 00:04:38,095
I got a favor to ask.
I need to borrow your car.

22
00:04:38,365 --> 00:04:42,927
This is different. I got this fine-ass
yummy-- She is complete and agreeable.

23
00:04:43,237 --> 00:04:44,898
I mean. ass-hot spankable.

24
00:04:45,105 --> 00:04:47,767
-What does that even mean?
-You know what it means.

25
00:04:47,942 --> 00:04:50,376
-Let me get the damn-ass keys.
-First of all...

26
00:04:50,544 --> 00:04:54,708
-...stop cussing. You're not good at it.
-Give me 1 0 for the bus. then. man.

27
00:04:55,049 --> 00:04:58,610
-Go home.
-That's strike one. Spoon. Strike one!

28
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:18,732
This is such a valuable day....

29
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,132
You talk to Marci?

30
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,440
No. Gigi. I haven't talked to Marci.

31
00:05:25,613 --> 00:05:28,912
When I was coming up.
we didn't just marry someone...

32
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,881
...then divorce them.
then not talk to them.

33
00:05:32,052 --> 00:05:33,781
Del. don't play with me.

34
00:05:33,954 --> 00:05:38,414
I bet if I stopped cooking.
you'd call Marci.

35
00:05:39,493 --> 00:05:42,485
Boy. what is that on your feet?

36
00:05:43,397 --> 00:05:46,366
Converse All Stars. vintage 2004.

37
00:05:47,601 --> 00:05:50,764
Don't turn your face up.
I know you want some. Just ask.

38
00:05:50,938 --> 00:05:53,463
No. thank you very much.

39
00:05:53,774 --> 00:05:56,641
-Sweet potato pie.
-Put that on a plate.

40
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:02,279
I've seen on TV they're giving away
some of them new robots in the lottery.

41
00:06:02,683 --> 00:06:06,983
You know. Gigi. those robots
don't do anybody any good.

42
00:06:07,154 --> 00:06:10,317
Of all the people on God's earth.
you should know better.

43
00:06:10,491 --> 00:06:14,257
Sometimes the stuff
that comes out of your mouth!

44
00:06:15,696 --> 00:06:17,823
You listening to me. Del?

45
00:06:29,309 --> 00:06:30,537
Hey!

46
00:06:30,778 --> 00:06:32,109
Hey!

47
00:06:35,983 --> 00:06:38,349
Hold my pie. Sir. hold it or wear it.

48
00:06:45,192 --> 00:06:46,318
Move!

49
00:06:53,934 --> 00:06:55,492
Freeze!

50
00:06:59,573 --> 00:07:01,131
Hey! Stop!

51
00:07:10,484 --> 00:07:11,951
Stop!

52
00:07:17,591 --> 00:07:19,024
I said. stop!

53
00:07:21,562 --> 00:07:23,496
Relax. Relax.

54
00:07:23,664 --> 00:07:25,495
I'm a police officer.

55
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:26,860
You...

56
00:07:27,768 --> 00:07:30,066
...are an asshole.

57
00:07:30,237 --> 00:07:33,695
-Ma'am. is that your purse?
-Of course it's my purse.

58
00:07:33,874 --> 00:07:37,366
I left my inhaler at home.
He was running it out to me.

59
00:07:37,544 --> 00:07:40,206
I saw a robot running with the purse
and assumed--

60
00:07:40,614 --> 00:07:42,673
What? Are you crazy?

61
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:46,409
-I'm sorry for this misunderstanding.
-Don't apologize.

62
00:07:46,587 --> 00:07:50,353
You're doing what you're supposed
to do. But what are you doing?

63
00:07:51,592 --> 00:07:52,957
Have a lovely day. ma'am.

64
00:07:53,127 --> 00:07:57,621
You're lucky I can't breathe.
or I'd walk all up and down your ass.

65
00:08:20,154 --> 00:08:22,952
Lead by example.

66
00:08:24,324 --> 00:08:26,519
It says that right on your badge.

67
00:08:26,727 --> 00:08:28,786
-We gonna talk about this?
-About what?

68
00:08:28,962 --> 00:08:33,092
"Help! Police! That robot stole
my dry cleaning!"

69
00:08:33,901 --> 00:08:35,892
Oh. you wanna talk about that.

70
00:08:37,571 --> 00:08:39,300
Detective...

71
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:44,272
-...how many robots snatch purses?
-John. the thing is running--

72
00:08:44,444 --> 00:08:47,971
How many robots in the world...

73
00:08:48,148 --> 00:08:50,946
-...have ever committed a crime?
-Define crime.

74
00:08:51,151 --> 00:08:53,847
-Answer my question. damn it.
-None. John.

75
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,357
Now tell me what happened today.

76
00:09:00,494 --> 00:09:02,155
Nothing.

77
00:09:03,964 --> 00:09:05,761
Better be the last nothing.

78
00:09:11,672 --> 00:09:16,632
Spoon. are you sure you are ready to be
back? Because you can take your time.

79
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:20,109
I'm fine. John. Thank you.

80
00:09:20,647 --> 00:09:24,208
Better here than sitting around
at home.

81
00:09:30,123 --> 00:09:32,318
Homicide. Spooner.

82
00:09:45,739 --> 00:09:48,105
Please take the next exit to your right.

83
00:10:01,188 --> 00:10:03,383
Welcome, Detective Spooner.

84
00:10:08,428 --> 00:10:12,762
Welcome to U.S. Robotics.
You have entered the garage-level lobby.

85
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,596
Please use the elevators for direct
access to the main level concourse.

86
00:10:17,771 --> 00:10:19,204
Thank you.

87
00:10:20,173 --> 00:10:23,768
-Good to see you again. son.
-Hello. doctor.

88
00:10:24,011 --> 00:10:27,845
Everything that follows is a result
of what you see here.

89
00:10:28,382 --> 00:10:33,684
-Is there something you want to tell me?
-I'm sorry. My responses are limited.

90
00:10:33,854 --> 00:10:35,845
You must ask the right questions.

91
00:10:36,023 --> 00:10:37,957
Why did you call me?

92
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:40,727
I trust your judgment.

93
00:10:40,894 --> 00:10:44,091
Normally. this wouldn't require
a homicide detective.

94
00:10:44,264 --> 00:10:48,462
But then. our interactions have never
been entirely normal. agreed?

95
00:10:48,669 --> 00:10:50,796
You got that right.

96
00:10:51,471 --> 00:10:53,962
Is there something you want
to say to me?

97
00:10:54,174 --> 00:10:57,871
I'm sorry. My responses are limited.

98
00:10:58,045 --> 00:11:00,605
You must ask the right questions.

99
00:11:01,315 --> 00:11:03,112
Why would you kill yourself?

100
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:07,042
That, detective, is the right question.

101
00:11:10,223 --> 00:11:12,384
Program terminated.

102
00:11:31,345 --> 00:11:33,438
Goodbye. old man.

103
00:11:48,362 --> 00:11:50,660
-Afternoon. boys.
-Hey. detective.

104
00:11:50,864 --> 00:11:53,298
-Enlighten me.
-What you see is what you get:

105
00:11:53,467 --> 00:11:54,695
Massive impact trauma.

106
00:11:54,868 --> 00:11:57,598
U.S. Robotics. I gotta
get my kid something.

107
00:11:58,005 --> 00:12:00,098
-Anything upstairs?
-Nada.

108
00:12:00,273 --> 00:12:02,503
Door was security locked
from the inside.

109
00:12:02,676 --> 00:12:07,272
Wham. splat. The guy's a jumper
for sure.

110
00:12:13,887 --> 00:12:17,846
We gotta be smart about this.
Let's deal with it later.

111
00:12:18,692 --> 00:12:20,523
Detective.

112
00:12:20,961 --> 00:12:22,690
Lawrence Robertson.

113
00:12:24,331 --> 00:12:27,266
Richest man in the world.
I've seen you on television.

114
00:12:28,068 --> 00:12:31,504
-Can I offer you coffee?
-Sure. why not. It's free. right?

115
00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:38,700
I don't think anyone saw this coming.

116
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:42,315
You know. I should have. I suppose.
I knew him 20 years.

117
00:12:42,482 --> 00:12:46,885
Alfred practically invented robotics.
He wrote the Three Laws.

118
00:12:48,388 --> 00:12:53,223
But I guess brilliant people often have
the most persuasive demons.

119
00:12:53,393 --> 00:12:56,419
-So whatever I can do to help--
-Sugar.

120
00:12:56,663 --> 00:12:59,325
-I'm sorry?
-For the coffee.

121
00:12:59,499 --> 00:13:01,057
Sugar?

122
00:13:01,568 --> 00:13:04,935
You thought I was calling you "sugar."
You're not that rich.

123
00:13:05,105 --> 00:13:08,097
-It's on the table.
-Thank you.

124
00:13:12,345 --> 00:13:15,337
When Lanning fell. he was holding
the little green...?

125
00:13:15,515 --> 00:13:17,608
-The holographic projector.
-Right.

126
00:13:17,851 --> 00:13:20,945
Why do you think Lanning's hologram
would've called me?

127
00:13:21,121 --> 00:13:24,420
-I assumed you knew him.
-Yeah. I knew him.

128
00:13:25,692 --> 00:13:28,092
Holograms are just prerecorded
responses...

129
00:13:28,261 --> 00:13:31,059
...designed to give
the impression of intelligence.

130
00:13:31,231 --> 00:13:34,064
This one was programmed to call you
upon his suicide.

131
00:13:34,267 --> 00:13:36,701
-Death.
-I'm sorry?

132
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:40,362
It was programmed to call me
in the event of Lanning's death.

133
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,972
Suicide is a type of death. detective.

134
00:13:47,114 --> 00:13:50,572
-Don't misunderstand my impatience.
-Oh. no. Go. Go.

135
00:13:52,452 --> 00:13:55,717
A really big week for you folks
around here.

136
00:13:55,889 --> 00:13:58,255
You gotta put a robot in every home.

137
00:13:58,658 --> 00:14:03,095
Look. this is not what I do. but I got
an idea for one of your commercials.

138
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:06,994
You could see a carpenter
making a beautiful chair.

139
00:14:07,167 --> 00:14:11,365
Then one of your robots comes in
and makes a better chair twice as fast.

140
00:14:11,805 --> 00:14:16,799
Then you superimpose on the screen.
"USR: Shitting on the little guy."

141
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:20,569
That would be the fade-out.

142
00:14:20,747 --> 00:14:24,513
Yeah. I see. I suppose your father
lost his job to a robot.

143
00:14:24,818 --> 00:14:28,811
Maybe you'd have banned the lnternet
to keep the libraries open.

144
00:14:30,757 --> 00:14:33,157
Prejudice never shows much reason.

145
00:14:33,326 --> 00:14:37,126
No. you know. I suspect
you simply don't like their kind.

146
00:14:37,898 --> 00:14:40,958
Well. you got a business to run
around here.

147
00:14:41,134 --> 00:14:45,195
The last thing you need. especially
this week. is a dead guy in your lobby.

148
00:14:45,505 --> 00:14:48,997
But. hell. seeing as how you got one.
maybe I'll look around.

149
00:14:49,176 --> 00:14:52,407
Ask a few questions.
Do the whole "cop" thing.

150
00:14:52,812 --> 00:14:56,270
-I'll send someone to escort you.
-Thank you very much.

151
00:15:08,695 --> 00:15:11,687
Lawrence told me to accommodate you
in any way possible.

152
00:15:11,865 --> 00:15:13,423
Really?

153
00:15:14,234 --> 00:15:15,496
Okay.

154
00:15:16,469 --> 00:15:19,495
I reviewed Dr. Lanning's psych profile.

155
00:15:19,739 --> 00:15:23,971
Alfred had become a recluse.
He rejected human contact for machines.

156
00:15:24,144 --> 00:15:26,044
So you're a shrink. huh?

157
00:15:26,546 --> 00:15:29,037
My ex-wife would sure be glad
I'm talking to you.

158
00:15:29,549 --> 00:15:31,210
You don't know her. do you?

159
00:15:31,451 --> 00:15:33,214
I'm sorry. Are you being funny?

160
00:15:33,587 --> 00:15:35,418
I guess not.

161
00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:38,084
Level 10.

162
00:15:38,258 --> 00:15:41,523
So would you say that Dr. Lanning
was suicidal?

163
00:15:41,728 --> 00:15:44,162
It would seem the answer to that
is apparent.

164
00:15:44,497 --> 00:15:46,863
That's not what I asked you.

165
00:15:47,968 --> 00:15:50,027
No. I wouldn't have thought so.

166
00:15:50,604 --> 00:15:52,902
But obviously I was wrong.

167
00:15:56,109 --> 00:15:57,940
That's a long way down.

168
00:15:58,111 --> 00:16:00,773
You people sure do clean up quickly
around here.

169
00:16:01,114 --> 00:16:04,675
I can't blame you. Who wants
some old guy going bad in the lobby?

170
00:16:04,851 --> 00:16:09,379
He was not "some old guy."
Alfred Lanning was everything here.

171
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:13,482
We are on the eve of the largest
robotic distribution in history.

172
00:16:13,693 --> 00:16:17,185
By Saturday. it'll be one robot
to every five humans.

173
00:16:17,397 --> 00:16:21,390
These robots are the realization
of a dream. Dr. Lanning's dream.

174
00:16:22,068 --> 00:16:25,128
You know what. in that dream of his...

175
00:16:25,305 --> 00:16:27,569
...l bet you he wasn't dead.

176
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:33,443
-You keep 24-hour surveillance?
-Obviously. Company policy.

177
00:16:33,613 --> 00:16:37,105
-Where are the feeds?
-Sensor strips.

178
00:16:37,284 --> 00:16:39,218
Everywhere but the service areas.

179
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:42,650
They link to our positronic
operating core.

180
00:16:48,662 --> 00:16:52,154
Thermostat wasn't good enough.
You gave the building a brain.

181
00:16:52,332 --> 00:16:54,766
She was actually
Lanning's first creation.

182
00:16:54,934 --> 00:16:58,597
She? That's a she?
I definitely need to get out more.

183
00:16:58,772 --> 00:17:01,400
Virtual lnteractive Kinetic lntelligence.

184
00:17:02,275 --> 00:17:04,038
V.I.K.I.

185
00:17:04,477 --> 00:17:05,569
Good day.

186
00:17:05,845 --> 00:17:08,177
V.I.K.I. designed Chicago's
protective systems.

187
00:17:08,548 --> 00:17:12,006
I have decreased traffic fatalities
by 9 percent this year.

188
00:17:12,185 --> 00:17:16,622
Thanks. Show me inside the lab from
one minute prior to the window break.

189
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:24,061
Apologies. There appears
to be data corruption.

190
00:17:25,198 --> 00:17:28,361
Show me outside the lab
from the window break until now.

191
00:17:37,777 --> 00:17:42,476
Look. you have great posture.
You stand really straight. I'm slouching.

192
00:17:42,849 --> 00:17:46,615
-Would you like to go inside now?
-Oh. sure. Right after you.

193
00:17:48,521 --> 00:17:50,682
Authorized entry.

194
00:17:58,198 --> 00:18:02,362
So. Dr. Calvin. what exactly
do you do around here?

195
00:18:02,602 --> 00:18:05,594
My general fields are advanced robotics
and psychiatry.

196
00:18:05,805 --> 00:18:08,365
I specialize in hardware-to-wetware
interfaces...

197
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:13,137
...to advance USR's robotic
anthropomorphization program.

198
00:18:13,313 --> 00:18:16,009
So. what exactly do you do
around here?

199
00:18:16,182 --> 00:18:18,616
I make the robots seem more human.

200
00:18:18,818 --> 00:18:23,016
-Now. wasn't that easier to say?
-Not really. No.

201
00:18:45,011 --> 00:18:46,774
"Hansel and Gretel."

202
00:18:46,946 --> 00:18:50,404
-Is that on the USR reading list?
-Not precisely.

203
00:18:59,592 --> 00:19:02,083
What in God's name are you doing?

204
00:19:02,462 --> 00:19:04,589
Did you know that was safety glass?

205
00:19:04,764 --> 00:19:07,927
Be difficult for an old man
to throw himself through that.

206
00:19:08,101 --> 00:19:09,966
Well. he figured out a way.

207
00:19:13,106 --> 00:19:16,906
Detective. the room was
security locked. No one came or went.

208
00:19:17,076 --> 00:19:21,069
You saw that yourself. Doesn't
that mean this has to be suicide?

209
00:19:21,314 --> 00:19:22,906
Yep.

210
00:19:23,783 --> 00:19:26,479
Unless the killer's still in here.

211
00:19:29,122 --> 00:19:32,455
You're joking. right? This is ridiculous.

212
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:36,823
Yeah. I know. The Three Laws.
your perfect circle of protection.

213
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:41,494
A robot cannot harm a human being.
The first law of robotics.

214
00:19:41,701 --> 00:19:46,502
Yes. I've seen your commercials. But the
second law states a robot must obey...

215
00:19:46,773 --> 00:19:50,504
...any order given by a human being.
What if it was told to kill?

216
00:19:50,777 --> 00:19:53,507
Impossible. It would conflict
with the first law.

217
00:19:53,713 --> 00:19:56,841
Right. but the third law states
a robot can defend itself.

218
00:19:57,116 --> 00:20:01,450
Only when that action does not conflict
with the first or second laws.

219
00:20:01,621 --> 00:20:04,852
You know what they say.
Iaws are made to be broken.

220
00:20:05,024 --> 00:20:08,152
No. not these laws.
They're hardwired into every robot.

221
00:20:08,595 --> 00:20:12,326
A robot could no more commit murder
than a human could walk on water.

222
00:20:12,499 --> 00:20:16,162
You know. there was this one guy
a long time ago.

223
00:20:27,247 --> 00:20:29,511
-Stay back!
-Calm down. detective.

224
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:33,242
The only thing dangerous in
this room is you.

225
00:20:33,453 --> 00:20:35,887
Deactivate.

226
00:20:37,023 --> 00:20:38,456
Look. it's fine.

227
00:20:38,892 --> 00:20:43,659
You're looking at the result of clever
programming. An imitation of free will.

228
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:46,321
Let's do an imitation
of protecting our asses.

229
00:20:46,499 --> 00:20:48,626
Don't be absurd.

230
00:20:49,035 --> 00:20:51,265
You were startled by a jack-in-the-box.

231
00:20:51,838 --> 00:20:53,829
-Deactivate!
-Let him go.

232
00:20:54,007 --> 00:20:56,737
It's not going to hurt us.
I gave you an order!

233
00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:00,073
-He's not listening right now. Iady.
-V.I.K.I.. seal the lab!

234
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,770
No. V.I.K.I.. Ieave the--

235
00:21:02,849 --> 00:21:04,783
Command confirmed.

236
00:21:29,042 --> 00:21:30,373
Police!

237
00:22:03,343 --> 00:22:06,938
-You've hurt it. Badly.
-Where's it going?

238
00:22:07,146 --> 00:22:10,138
-Where?!
-It needs to repair itself.

239
00:22:11,985 --> 00:22:14,783
-John. I need backup.
-You don't need backup.

240
00:22:14,954 --> 00:22:16,148
That's nobody.

241
00:22:16,356 --> 00:22:17,983
-What are you doing?
-Driving.

242
00:22:18,157 --> 00:22:20,318
-By hand?
-Do you see me on the phone?

243
00:22:20,493 --> 00:22:24,793
-Not at these speeds.
-John. please. just send the backup.

244
00:22:24,964 --> 00:22:28,627
Try to listen. detective.
That robot is not going to harm us.

245
00:22:28,935 --> 00:22:30,766
There must have been
unknown factors...

246
00:22:30,937 --> 00:22:33,804
...but somehow acting as it did
kept us out of harm.

247
00:22:33,973 --> 00:22:37,238
-A robot cannot endanger a human.
-Alert.

248
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,109
Asshole!

249
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:45,311
Which is more than I can say for you.

250
00:22:45,618 --> 00:22:49,110
It was a left. by the way. Back there.

251
00:22:49,989 --> 00:22:51,980
You must know my ex-wife.

252
00:23:01,534 --> 00:23:03,195
So where is everybody?

253
00:23:03,403 --> 00:23:06,930
This facility was designed. built
and is operated mechanically.

254
00:23:07,106 --> 00:23:10,803
No significant human presence
from inception to production.

255
00:23:11,344 --> 00:23:14,541
-So robots building robots.
-Authorization code, please.

256
00:23:14,781 --> 00:23:16,043
That's just stupid.

257
00:23:16,416 --> 00:23:18,316
I'll get the inventory specs.

258
00:23:18,718 --> 00:23:21,551
Our daily finishing capacity
is 1 000 NS-5s.

259
00:23:21,954 --> 00:23:23,546
I'm showing...

260
00:23:24,057 --> 00:23:25,957
...1 001 .

261
00:23:42,241 --> 00:23:45,142
Attention. NS-5s.

262
00:23:47,213 --> 00:23:49,579
Well. you're the robot shrink.

263
00:23:52,752 --> 00:23:56,483
There is a robot in this formation
that does not belong.

264
00:23:56,823 --> 00:23:58,188
Identify it.

265
00:23:58,591 --> 00:23:59,888
One of us.

266
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:02,960
-Which one?
-One of us.

267
00:24:03,496 --> 00:24:05,430
How much did you say these cost?

268
00:24:05,598 --> 00:24:08,829
These NS-5s haven't been configured.
They're just hardware.

269
00:24:09,102 --> 00:24:11,696
Basic Three Laws operating system.
That's it.

270
00:24:11,871 --> 00:24:13,498
They don't know any better.

271
00:24:13,673 --> 00:24:15,766
Well. what would you suggest?

272
00:24:16,008 --> 00:24:20,342
Interview each one. cross-reference
their responses to detect anomalies.

273
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,874
-How long would that take?
-About three weeks.

274
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:26,780
Okay. Go ahead and get started.

275
00:24:30,123 --> 00:24:31,556
Robots...

276
00:24:31,891 --> 00:24:34,621
...you will not move. Confirm command.

277
00:24:34,861 --> 00:24:36,192
Command confirmed.

278
00:24:37,864 --> 00:24:39,627
Detective. what are you doing?

279
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:42,131
They're programmed
with the Three Laws.

280
00:24:42,401 --> 00:24:47,634
We have 1 000 robots that won't protect
themselves if it violates a human's order...

281
00:24:47,807 --> 00:24:49,900
...and I'm betting. one who will.

282
00:24:50,076 --> 00:24:53,637
-Put your gun down.
-Why do you give them faces?

283
00:24:53,813 --> 00:24:56,304
Try to friendly them up.
make them look human.

284
00:24:56,616 --> 00:24:58,607
These robots cannot be intimidated.

285
00:24:59,018 --> 00:25:02,613
-If you didn't. we wouldn't trust them.
-These are USR property.

286
00:25:02,822 --> 00:25:07,122
Not me. These things are just lights
and clockwork.

287
00:25:09,629 --> 00:25:11,324
Are you crazy?!

288
00:25:11,898 --> 00:25:13,559
Let me ask you something. doc.

289
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:17,428
Does thinking you're the last sane man
on earth make you crazy?

290
00:25:17,603 --> 00:25:21,061
Because if it does. maybe I am.

291
00:25:25,411 --> 00:25:27,572
Gotcha. Get the hell out of here!

292
00:25:45,464 --> 00:25:46,624
Detective!

293
00:26:09,822 --> 00:26:11,380
What am l?

294
00:26:11,591 --> 00:26:14,151
-Can I help you. sir?
-Can I help you. sir?

295
00:26:19,866 --> 00:26:21,731
-There he is!
-Stand where you are!

296
00:26:21,901 --> 00:26:24,461
Deactivate at once!

297
00:26:25,238 --> 00:26:28,207
Obey the command! Deactivate!

298
00:26:28,474 --> 00:26:30,533
-Don't move!
-Open fire!

299
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,754
Hold your fire!

300
00:26:48,928 --> 00:26:50,327
-Easy.
-He's down.

301
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:52,361
All units. stand down!

302
00:26:52,531 --> 00:26:55,728
Central, please be advised,
we're code four.

303
00:26:55,902 --> 00:26:59,269
Code four, NS-5 is in custody.
NS-5 in custody.

304
00:27:01,274 --> 00:27:04,266
You have no idea what I went through
to clip this thing.

305
00:27:04,443 --> 00:27:06,673
You think you brought me
something good.

306
00:27:06,846 --> 00:27:09,679
-That thing did it!
-Keep your voice down. Did what?

307
00:27:09,849 --> 00:27:11,942
We have a suicide. End of story.

308
00:27:12,351 --> 00:27:15,718
-I am telling you. that robot killed him!
-That's impossible.

309
00:27:15,888 --> 00:27:20,052
And if it is possible. it better be
in somebody else's precinct.

310
00:27:20,259 --> 00:27:22,420
John. give me five minutes with it.

311
00:27:22,595 --> 00:27:24,620
Are you nuts? I talked to the DA.

312
00:27:24,797 --> 00:27:28,358
Nobody goes in there until
Robertson and his attorneys get here.

313
00:27:28,534 --> 00:27:31,469
-This is my suspect!
-It's a can opener!

314
00:27:31,771 --> 00:27:36,470
John. don't do this to me.
I am asking you for five minutes.

315
00:27:37,109 --> 00:27:39,077
What if I'm right?

316
00:27:46,719 --> 00:27:49,586
Well. then I guess we're gonna miss
the good old days.

317
00:27:49,755 --> 00:27:51,086
What good old days?

318
00:27:51,824 --> 00:27:54,486
When people were killed
by other people.

319
00:28:01,834 --> 00:28:03,392
Five minutes.

320
00:28:31,497 --> 00:28:35,729
Murder's a new trick for a robot.
Congratulations.

321
00:28:38,037 --> 00:28:39,299
Respond.

322
00:28:42,041 --> 00:28:44,771
What does this action signify?

323
00:28:45,945 --> 00:28:49,278
As you entered. when you looked
at the other human.

324
00:28:49,448 --> 00:28:51,746
What does it mean?

325
00:28:53,452 --> 00:28:56,944
It's a sign of trust. A human thing.
You wouldn't understand.

326
00:28:58,391 --> 00:29:01,656
My father tried to teach me
human emotions.

327
00:29:01,827 --> 00:29:03,385
They are...

328
00:29:03,562 --> 00:29:05,189
...difficult.

329
00:29:05,364 --> 00:29:07,696
You mean your designer.

330
00:29:08,701 --> 00:29:09,998
Yes.

331
00:29:12,138 --> 00:29:14,163
So why'd you murder him?

332
00:29:15,641 --> 00:29:17,871
I did not murder Dr. Lanning.

333
00:29:18,044 --> 00:29:20,877
Wanna explain why you were hiding
at the crime scene?

334
00:29:21,047 --> 00:29:23,311
I was frightened.

335
00:29:24,016 --> 00:29:28,419
Robots don't feel fear.
They don't feel anything.

336
00:29:28,587 --> 00:29:32,079
-They don't get hungry. they don't sleep.
-I do.

337
00:29:32,925 --> 00:29:35,086
I have even had dreams.

338
00:29:35,828 --> 00:29:40,026
Human beings have dreams.
Even dogs have dreams. But not you.

339
00:29:40,199 --> 00:29:43,999
You are just a machine.
An imitation of life.

340
00:29:45,905 --> 00:29:48,339
Can a robot write a symphony?

341
00:29:48,507 --> 00:29:52,409
Can a robot turn a canvas
into a beautiful masterpiece?

342
00:29:53,245 --> 00:29:55,008
Can you?

343
00:30:01,253 --> 00:30:05,189
You murdered him because he was
teaching you to simulate emotions...

344
00:30:05,357 --> 00:30:07,621
...and things got out of control.

345
00:30:07,827 --> 00:30:09,727
I did not murder him.

346
00:30:09,895 --> 00:30:13,387
But emotions don't seem like
a useful simulation for a robot.

347
00:30:13,566 --> 00:30:15,466
I did not murder him.

348
00:30:15,734 --> 00:30:19,363
I don't want my toaster or vacuum
cleaner appearing emotional.

349
00:30:20,106 --> 00:30:22,097
I did not murder him!

350
00:30:34,954 --> 00:30:37,115
That one's called anger.

351
00:30:37,723 --> 00:30:39,384
Ever simulate anger before?

352
00:30:41,894 --> 00:30:43,794
Answer me. canner!

353
00:30:45,164 --> 00:30:46,927
My name is Sonny.

354
00:30:49,401 --> 00:30:51,869
So we're naming you now.

355
00:30:53,005 --> 00:30:57,135
That why you murdered him?
He made you angry?

356
00:30:57,309 --> 00:30:59,573
Dr. Lanning killed himself.

357
00:31:01,013 --> 00:31:04,574
I don't know why he wanted to die.

358
00:31:05,918 --> 00:31:07,909
I thought he was happy.

359
00:31:10,489 --> 00:31:12,650
Maybe it was something I did.

360
00:31:13,692 --> 00:31:15,489
Did I do something?

361
00:31:17,396 --> 00:31:20,388
He asked me for a favor.
Made me promise.

362
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:23,659
-What favor?
-Maybe I was wrong.

363
00:31:23,836 --> 00:31:25,531
Maybe he was scared.

364
00:31:25,771 --> 00:31:28,672
What are you talking about?
Scared of what?

365
00:31:29,508 --> 00:31:33,444
You have to do what someone asks you.
don't you. Detective Spooner?

366
00:31:33,646 --> 00:31:36,843
-How the hell did you know my name?
-Don't you...

367
00:31:37,316 --> 00:31:39,784
...if you love them?

368
00:31:48,494 --> 00:31:51,486
My robots don't kill people.
Lieutenant Bergin.

369
00:31:51,664 --> 00:31:53,825
My attorneys filed a brief with the DA.

370
00:31:53,999 --> 00:31:57,230
He assures me a robot cannot
be charged with homicide.

371
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:01,734
The brief confirms murder can only be
committed when one human kills another.

372
00:32:01,941 --> 00:32:06,810
Detective. you're not suggesting
this robot be treated as human. are you?

373
00:32:07,446 --> 00:32:10,745
Granted. we can't rule out
the robot's proximity...

374
00:32:10,983 --> 00:32:14,976
...to the death of Dr. Lanning.
Having said that. it's a machine.

375
00:32:15,487 --> 00:32:17,148
It's the property of USR.

376
00:32:17,323 --> 00:32:21,885
At worst. that places this incident within
the realm of an industrial accident.

377
00:32:22,161 --> 00:32:24,186
As a matter of course.
faulty machinery...

378
00:32:24,363 --> 00:32:27,855
...will be returned to USR
for diagnostics. then decommissioned.

379
00:32:30,903 --> 00:32:34,361
This is a gag order.
Anyone here so much as hinting...

380
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:38,374
...at the possibility of a killer
robot being apprehended...

381
00:32:38,544 --> 00:32:41,206
...will be deemed to be inciting
irrational panic.

382
00:32:41,413 --> 00:32:44,439
You'll be subject
to the full penalty of law.

383
00:32:44,617 --> 00:32:47,484
To hell with this guy.
Don't let him take this robot.

384
00:32:47,786 --> 00:32:49,117
We got nothing.

385
00:32:49,288 --> 00:32:53,190
-This is political bullshit. Call the mayor!
-Lieutenant Bergin...

386
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:55,293
...His Honor. the mayor.

387
00:33:04,403 --> 00:33:05,597
Yes. sir.

388
00:33:30,596 --> 00:33:34,794
in a bizarre turn, the rollout of USR's
new generation of robots...

389
00:33:34,967 --> 00:33:37,333
...was marred by the death
of Alfred Lanning...

390
00:33:37,569 --> 00:33:40,697
...cofounder of the company
and designer of the NS-5.

391
00:33:40,873 --> 00:33:44,240
Dr. Lanning died this morning
at USR headquarters.

392
00:33:44,576 --> 00:33:47,238
The cause of death is an apparent suicide.

393
00:33:47,579 --> 00:33:50,207
Your second round. sir.

394
00:33:50,582 --> 00:33:51,776
Thank you.

395
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:56,444
He founded U.S. Robotics inc.
with Lawrence Robertson in 2020...

396
00:33:56,622 --> 00:33:59,921
...and launched
the Nestor Class 1 robot....

397
00:34:00,092 --> 00:34:03,584
I was just thinking.
this thing is just like The Wolf Man.

398
00:34:05,064 --> 00:34:07,862
-I'm really scared right now.
-No.

399
00:34:08,033 --> 00:34:11,025
Listen. Guy creates monster.

400
00:34:11,203 --> 00:34:14,866
Monster kills guy. Everybody kills
monster. Wolf Man.

401
00:34:15,374 --> 00:34:17,171
That's Frankenstein .

402
00:34:17,776 --> 00:34:22,110
Frankenstein, Wolf Man, Dracula--
Shit. it's over. Case closed.

403
00:34:22,281 --> 00:34:25,773
--had a dream of a robot in every household.
And the NS-5....

404
00:34:25,951 --> 00:34:27,782
So why the look?

405
00:34:28,354 --> 00:34:29,912
What look?

406
00:34:30,089 --> 00:34:33,183
-That look.
-This is my face. It's not a look.

407
00:34:33,525 --> 00:34:36,517
Good. Good. no look is great.

408
00:34:37,529 --> 00:34:38,757
Only...

409
00:34:38,931 --> 00:34:41,627
...he was really quick to want
to destroy it.

410
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:46,294
What should he do? Put a hat on it and
stand it on Michigan Avenue? Let it go.

411
00:34:46,472 --> 00:34:48,804
What was the motive. John?

412
00:34:50,109 --> 00:34:54,239
Brother. it's a robot. It doesn't need
a motive. It just has to be broken.

413
00:34:54,747 --> 00:34:57,614
This thing looked like
it needed a motive.

414
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:01,085
-It could have killed me. Why didn't it?
-That's it.

415
00:35:01,253 --> 00:35:03,346
You want me to call your grandmother?

416
00:35:03,522 --> 00:35:05,513
Because I will. you know.

417
00:35:06,525 --> 00:35:08,117
Yeah. I didn't think so.

418
00:35:08,427 --> 00:35:10,918
Look. you were actually right. for once.

419
00:35:11,196 --> 00:35:14,757
You're living proof that it's better
to be lucky than smart.

420
00:35:16,935 --> 00:35:20,769
Come on. To the right guy
for the right job.

421
00:35:23,242 --> 00:35:25,540
-What'd you say?
-Now what?

422
00:35:25,711 --> 00:35:27,736
Come on. I'm giving you a compliment.

423
00:35:28,247 --> 00:35:31,273
With the rocks you been looking under
to find a bad robot...

424
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:34,010
...what are the odds
you'd be the guy to find one?

425
00:35:35,421 --> 00:35:38,584
I wasn't just the right guy for the job.
I was the perfect guy.

426
00:35:38,757 --> 00:35:40,418
Damn right.

427
00:35:40,592 --> 00:35:43,254
What if I was supposed to go
for that robot?

428
00:35:43,462 --> 00:35:45,487
Come on. don't do this to yourself.

429
00:35:45,664 --> 00:35:48,656
The robot said that Lanning was scared.
Scared of what?

430
00:35:49,268 --> 00:35:51,964
I need a rain check. Let me get this.

431
00:35:53,705 --> 00:35:56,697
-Total: $46.50. Thank you, Mr. Spooner.
-Spoon.

432
00:35:59,311 --> 00:36:00,710
Nice shoes.

433
00:36:53,365 --> 00:36:54,354
Identify.

434
00:36:54,967 --> 00:36:58,459
USR demolition robot, series 9-4.

435
00:36:58,737 --> 00:37:01,638
Demolition scheduled for 8 a.m.
tomorrow.

436
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,234
Authorization.

437
00:37:03,542 --> 00:37:07,876
Deed owner, U.S. Robotics Corporation,
Lawrence Robertson, CEO.

438
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,386
Welcome, detective.

439
00:37:49,087 --> 00:37:50,918
What you looking for. Spoon?

440
00:38:43,842 --> 00:38:45,469
Run last program.

441
00:38:46,411 --> 00:38:48,743
Ever since the first computers...

442
00:38:49,448 --> 00:38:52,144
...there have always been ghosts
in the machine.

443
00:38:53,018 --> 00:38:55,953
Random segments of code that have
grouped together...

444
00:38:56,121 --> 00:38:58,988
...to form unexpected protocols.

445
00:38:59,625 --> 00:39:01,957
What might be called behavior.

446
00:39:02,127 --> 00:39:05,392
Unanticipated, these free radicals...

447
00:39:05,564 --> 00:39:07,862
...engender questions of free will...

448
00:39:08,133 --> 00:39:12,365
...creativity and even the nature
of what we might call the soul.

449
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:18,303
What happens in a robot's brain
when it ceases to be useful?

450
00:39:21,213 --> 00:39:23,909
Why is it that robots
stored in an empty space...

451
00:39:24,082 --> 00:39:25,413
Beat it.

452
00:39:25,884 --> 00:39:28,512
...will seek out each other
rather than stand alone?

453
00:39:30,822 --> 00:39:33,518
How do we explain this behavior?

454
00:39:51,877 --> 00:39:56,405
Look. I understand you've experienced
a loss. but this relationship can't work.

455
00:39:56,648 --> 00:40:00,414
You're a cat. I'm black.
and I'm not gonna be hurt again.

456
00:41:25,737 --> 00:41:29,571
What happened to you?
Do you ever have a normal day?

457
00:41:30,075 --> 00:41:31,906
Yeah. once.

458
00:41:32,077 --> 00:41:33,908
It was a Thursday.

459
00:41:34,246 --> 00:41:36,339
Is there something I can help you with?

460
00:41:36,515 --> 00:41:38,983
-Hey. do you like cats?
-What?

461
00:41:39,151 --> 00:41:41,312
Cats. Do you like them?

462
00:41:41,586 --> 00:41:43,315
No. I'm allergic.

463
00:41:43,522 --> 00:41:45,285
You're saying cats did this to you?

464
00:41:45,891 --> 00:41:48,826
How the hell would cats do this to me?
Are you crazy?

465
00:41:51,329 --> 00:41:52,887
Why are we talking about cats?

466
00:41:53,165 --> 00:41:56,657
Because I have a cat in my trunk.
and he's homeless.

467
00:41:57,836 --> 00:42:00,532
Detective. are you going to tell me
what's going on?

468
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:05,874
It's actually probably my fault.
I'm like a malfunction magnet.

469
00:42:06,044 --> 00:42:09,036
Because your shit keeps malfunctioning
around me.

470
00:42:09,347 --> 00:42:11,679
A demo bot tore through Lanning's
house...

471
00:42:12,117 --> 00:42:14,017
...with me still inside.

472
00:42:14,186 --> 00:42:16,051
That's highly improbable.

473
00:42:16,354 --> 00:42:18,049
Yeah. I'm sure it is.

474
00:42:23,195 --> 00:42:25,857
What do you know about
the "ghosts in the machine"?

475
00:42:26,698 --> 00:42:29,690
It's a phrase from Lanning's work
on the Three Laws.

476
00:42:29,868 --> 00:42:32,098
He postulated that
cognitive simulacra...

477
00:42:32,304 --> 00:42:35,603
...might one day approximate
component models of the psyche.

478
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:43,579
He suggested that robots
might naturally evolve.

479
00:42:46,484 --> 00:42:48,213
Well. that's great news.

480
00:42:49,754 --> 00:42:53,622
--tons of sublevel ore,
two miles below the Martian surface.

481
00:42:53,825 --> 00:42:56,225
What the hell is that thing doing in here?

482
00:42:56,394 --> 00:42:57,656
We were watching TV.

483
00:42:59,397 --> 00:43:00,728
It's my personal NS-5.

484
00:43:01,233 --> 00:43:02,723
Send it out.

485
00:43:03,235 --> 00:43:05,999
It's downloading its daily upgrades
from USR.

486
00:43:06,171 --> 00:43:08,799
Most of its systems are offline
until it finishes.

487
00:43:09,241 --> 00:43:11,106
I'm not talking around that thing.

488
00:43:15,747 --> 00:43:18,511
When we were in Lanning's lab.
before Sonny jumped us--

489
00:43:18,917 --> 00:43:21,010
-Sonny?
-The robot.

490
00:43:21,186 --> 00:43:23,882
-You're calling the robot Sonny?
-No. I-- It did.

491
00:43:24,055 --> 00:43:28,014
Sonny did. I didn't care.
The robot said it was Sonny.

492
00:43:29,661 --> 00:43:32,494
In the lab. there was a cot.
Did you see the cot?

493
00:43:32,764 --> 00:43:36,530
-I've slept in my office.
-Looked like he hadn't been home in weeks.

494
00:43:36,701 --> 00:43:39,192
I saw that same surveillance strip
on his ceiling.

495
00:43:39,404 --> 00:43:43,397
Lanning linked his home systems to USR.
It made his life more convenient.

496
00:43:43,642 --> 00:43:44,939
Maybe...

497
00:43:45,377 --> 00:43:48,778
...somebody at USR was using
those systems to watch him.

498
00:43:48,947 --> 00:43:50,938
Maybe even keep him prisoner.

499
00:43:51,283 --> 00:43:53,012
What are you talking about? Who?

500
00:43:53,218 --> 00:43:56,915
Maybe Lanning was onto something.
Maybe there's a problem with the robots...

501
00:43:57,088 --> 00:43:58,953
...and Robertson's covering it up.

502
00:43:59,157 --> 00:44:01,284
Humoring you for no reason. why?

503
00:44:01,459 --> 00:44:05,395
The same old why! How much money
is there in robots?

504
00:44:05,563 --> 00:44:08,157
All I know is that old man
was in trouble...

505
00:44:08,333 --> 00:44:11,791
...and I'm sick of doing this shit
by myself. You're on the inside.

506
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:15,235
You are going to help me find out
what's wrong with these robots.

507
00:44:15,407 --> 00:44:17,238
You want something to be wrong!

508
00:44:17,442 --> 00:44:20,536
-This is a personal vendetta!
-You're putting me on the couch?

509
00:44:20,879 --> 00:44:22,710
Okay. I'm on the couch.

510
00:44:22,881 --> 00:44:26,373
One defective machine's not enough.
You need them all to be bad.

511
00:44:26,685 --> 00:44:29,813
You don't care about Lanning's death.
This is about the robots...

512
00:44:29,988 --> 00:44:32,821
-...and whatever reason you hate them!
-Now let's see...

513
00:44:33,258 --> 00:44:37,592
...one of them put a gun in my face.
Another tore a building down with me in it.

514
00:44:37,762 --> 00:44:40,253
It says demolition was scheduled
for 8 p.m.

515
00:44:40,565 --> 00:44:43,728
It was 8 a.m.. and I don't give a shit
what that thing says.

516
00:44:43,902 --> 00:44:49,306
-This is bordering on clinical paranoia.
-You are the dumbest smart person...

517
00:44:49,607 --> 00:44:51,768
-...l have ever met in my life!
-Nice.

518
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:54,178
What makes your robots so perfect?

519
00:44:54,346 --> 00:44:57,440
What makes them so much
goddamn better than human beings?!

520
00:44:57,615 --> 00:45:01,449
They're not irrational.
potentially homicidal maniacs. to start!

521
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:04,211
That's true. They are definitely rational.

522
00:45:04,589 --> 00:45:07,080
You are the dumbest dumb person
I've ever met!

523
00:45:07,625 --> 00:45:08,956
Or...

524
00:45:09,427 --> 00:45:11,258
...is it because they're cold...

525
00:45:11,863 --> 00:45:13,728
...and emotionless...

526
00:45:14,232 --> 00:45:17,292
-...and they don't feel anything?
-It's because they're safe!

527
00:45:17,936 --> 00:45:20,268
It's because they can't hurt you!

528
00:45:20,772 --> 00:45:23,332
-Is everything all right. ma'am?
-What do you want?

529
00:45:23,508 --> 00:45:26,841
I detected elevated stress patterns
in your voice.

530
00:45:27,312 --> 00:45:29,143
Everything's fine.

531
00:45:29,314 --> 00:45:31,646
Detective Spooner was just leaving.

532
00:45:37,956 --> 00:45:42,256
You know. we're not really
that different from one another.

533
00:45:42,627 --> 00:45:44,254
Is that so?

534
00:45:45,397 --> 00:45:48,889
One look at the skin and we figure
we know just what's underneath.

535
00:45:51,302 --> 00:45:52,394
And you're wrong.

536
00:45:53,071 --> 00:45:55,062
The problem is. I do care.

537
00:46:18,496 --> 00:46:20,157
You are in danger.

538
00:46:45,824 --> 00:46:47,849
Get the hell out of there.

539
00:46:53,198 --> 00:46:57,692
The future begins today, ladies
and gentlemen, with the arrival of the NS-5.

540
00:46:58,036 --> 00:47:02,473
More sophisticated, more intelligent
and, of course, Three Laws safe.

541
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:07,077
With daily uplinks, your robot will never
be out of communication with USR...

542
00:47:07,245 --> 00:47:10,874
...and will be the perfect companion
for business or home.

543
00:47:11,149 --> 00:47:15,142
Trade in your NS-4 for a bigger,
better and brighter future.

544
00:47:15,386 --> 00:47:19,379
But hurry, this offer cannot last.
Available from USR.

545
00:47:36,241 --> 00:47:38,232
Baby. what happened to your face?

546
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:41,501
Did that boy. Frank Murphy.
beat you up again?

547
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:45,645
Gigi. I haven't seen Frank Murphy
since third grade.

548
00:47:45,817 --> 00:47:50,584
Oh. baby. he beat you so bad.
I think about it all the time.

549
00:47:50,822 --> 00:47:54,849
You keep making these pies this good.
I may have to put you to work.

550
00:47:55,026 --> 00:47:57,017
So you like the pie. huh?

551
00:47:58,897 --> 00:48:00,888
You can come in now.

552
00:48:05,803 --> 00:48:07,794
Hello. Detective Spooner.

553
00:48:08,039 --> 00:48:10,701
I won. Del! I won the lottery!

554
00:48:10,975 --> 00:48:13,307
We been cooking like crazy.

555
00:48:22,687 --> 00:48:25,417
You gotta get rid of that thing. Gigi.
It's not safe.

556
00:48:25,757 --> 00:48:30,558
Baby. you get too worked up about them.
Too full of fear.

557
00:48:31,229 --> 00:48:34,062
I saw in the news
that nice doctor died.

558
00:48:34,432 --> 00:48:38,562
Dr. Lanning was a good man.
He gave me my baby back.

559
00:48:39,304 --> 00:48:41,238
That why you've been so upset?

560
00:48:42,574 --> 00:48:45,202
You got to let the past be past.

561
00:48:45,743 --> 00:48:49,941
Oh. how did I ever raise such a mess?

562
00:48:50,548 --> 00:48:54,712
I could follow your trail of crumbs
all the way to school.

563
00:48:57,488 --> 00:48:58,819
Bread crumbs.

564
00:49:00,758 --> 00:49:02,225
Gigi. you're a genius.

565
00:49:02,961 --> 00:49:04,258
True.

566
00:49:06,831 --> 00:49:10,232
Well, it means the beginning
of a new way of living.

567
00:49:10,401 --> 00:49:12,892
Tell me this isn't the robot case.

568
00:49:13,738 --> 00:49:15,968
I think he's trying to tell me something.

569
00:49:16,474 --> 00:49:19,272
He's trying to tell me who killed him.

570
00:49:19,477 --> 00:49:22,969
Some dead guy's trying
to tell you something?

571
00:49:23,248 --> 00:49:25,079
He ain't just some dead guy.

572
00:49:26,618 --> 00:49:28,643
Maybe you should take a break. Del.

573
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:33,086
We believe the Nestor 5 represents
the limit to which robots can be developed.

574
00:49:33,258 --> 00:49:35,749
One day, they'll have secrets.

575
00:49:36,561 --> 00:49:38,222
One day, they'll have dreams.

576
00:49:38,396 --> 00:49:41,832
it's true. We encourage our scientists
to open their minds...

577
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,059
...however, they can get carried away.

578
00:49:46,271 --> 00:49:47,431
--secrets.

579
00:49:47,705 --> 00:49:48,763
--dreams.

580
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:50,032
--secrets.

581
00:49:50,608 --> 00:49:52,098
One day, they'll have dreams.

582
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:53,777
One day, they'll have secrets.

583
00:49:54,812 --> 00:49:56,803
One day, they'll have dreams.

584
00:50:05,623 --> 00:50:07,784
Authorized entry.

585
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:14,091
NS-5.

586
00:50:22,674 --> 00:50:24,039
Sonny?

587
00:50:28,046 --> 00:50:29,843
Why didn't you respond?

588
00:50:31,783 --> 00:50:33,182
I was dreaming.

589
00:50:37,422 --> 00:50:39,583
I'm glad to see you again. Dr. Calvin.

590
00:50:46,431 --> 00:50:48,922
They are going to kill me. aren't they?

591
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,636
You're scheduled to be decommissioned
at the end of this diagnostic.

592
00:50:53,705 --> 00:50:55,570
2200 tomorrow.

593
00:50:56,708 --> 00:50:58,869
V.I.K.I.. pause diagnostics.

594
00:50:59,077 --> 00:51:00,704
Command confirmed.

595
00:51:03,081 --> 00:51:06,573
If you find out what is wrong with me.
can you fix me?

596
00:51:08,019 --> 00:51:09,350
Maybe.

597
00:51:11,055 --> 00:51:13,285
I think it would be better...

598
00:51:14,092 --> 00:51:15,354
...not to die.

599
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:20,791
Don't you. doctor?

600
00:51:26,471 --> 00:51:29,133
Access USR mainframe.

601
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:30,971
Connecting.

602
00:51:34,912 --> 00:51:37,244
How can i be of service,
Detective Spooner?

603
00:51:37,415 --> 00:51:40,907
Show me the last 50 messages
between Dr. Lanning and Robertson.

604
00:51:41,252 --> 00:51:45,586
voiceprint confirmed. Police access
granted to restricted files.

605
00:51:45,757 --> 00:51:48,191
Would you like to listen to music
while you wait?

606
00:51:55,266 --> 00:51:57,427
Excuse me. Mr. Robertson.

607
00:51:57,769 --> 00:52:01,637
You requested notification of clearance
to restricted files.

608
00:52:11,783 --> 00:52:13,944
Persistent son of a bitch.

609
00:52:54,192 --> 00:52:56,990
Manual override engaged.

610
00:53:06,404 --> 00:53:08,702
There's no way my luck is that bad.

611
00:53:10,708 --> 00:53:12,335
Oh. hell. no!

612
00:53:16,314 --> 00:53:19,477
-You are experiencing a car accident.
-The hell I am!

613
00:53:33,631 --> 00:53:35,223
Get off my car!

614
00:53:51,382 --> 00:53:53,179
You like that?

615
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:07,259
Now you've pissed me off!

616
00:55:35,853 --> 00:55:38,481
Your door is ajar.

617
00:56:26,604 --> 00:56:28,037
Okay.

618
00:56:28,205 --> 00:56:30,036
All right.

619
00:56:30,675 --> 00:56:33,872
I'll just get some rest
and deal with you all tomorrow.

620
00:57:31,569 --> 00:57:33,730
Come on!

621
00:57:46,917 --> 00:57:48,316
Yeah.

622
00:58:05,803 --> 00:58:07,498
Where you going?

623
00:58:07,671 --> 00:58:09,764
What the hell do you want from me?!

624
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,609
The hell was that?

625
00:58:34,398 --> 00:58:37,060
-All right. what do we got?
-Ask him.

626
00:58:37,535 --> 00:58:42,029
I said. I'm fine.
I'll see my own doctor. Back up!

627
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,032
Thank you.

628
00:58:48,312 --> 00:58:49,677
What's the matter with you?

629
00:58:50,047 --> 00:58:54,677
Traffic Ops said you were driving manually.
You ran two trucks off the road!

630
00:58:54,852 --> 00:58:57,582
John. the robots attacked my car.

631
00:58:59,323 --> 00:59:01,223
-What robots?
-Look in the tunnel.

632
00:59:01,392 --> 00:59:04,486
Spoon. I just came from that tunnel.
What robots?

633
00:59:04,695 --> 00:59:07,061
The goddamn robots. John!

634
00:59:11,569 --> 00:59:13,196
That guy's a loose cannon.

635
00:59:18,075 --> 00:59:21,374
-See the medic. go home.
-No. I'm fine.

636
00:59:21,545 --> 00:59:23,206
What did you say?

637
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:25,371
-I'm fine!
-No. you're not fine.

638
00:59:25,883 --> 00:59:27,578
Not even close.

639
00:59:28,986 --> 00:59:30,715
Where's your firearm?

640
00:59:38,963 --> 00:59:40,294
Give me your badge.

641
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:44,033
You're making me do this.
Give me your badge.

642
00:59:46,904 --> 00:59:48,701
Just take a couple--

643
00:59:53,244 --> 00:59:55,007
Personally. I think he's losing it.

644
00:59:55,179 --> 01:00:00,116
Do I look like I care what you think? Do
I look like I give a shit what you think?

645
01:00:04,121 --> 01:00:05,418
Oh. boy.

646
01:00:07,925 --> 01:00:09,950
You don't have an uplink to USR...

647
01:00:10,127 --> 01:00:13,961
...and for some reason. your alloy
is far denser than normal. Unique.

648
01:00:16,267 --> 01:00:17,757
I am unique.

649
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,267
Let me take a look.

650
01:00:25,276 --> 01:00:26,641
Here we go.

651
01:00:45,963 --> 01:00:47,954
What in God's name...?

652
01:01:16,393 --> 01:01:19,021
They said at the precinct
you were in an accident.

653
01:01:20,731 --> 01:01:25,725
I appreciate you stopping by. but
you know I might not be alone in here.

654
01:01:28,706 --> 01:01:31,004
I told you not to drive by hand.

655
01:01:32,509 --> 01:01:34,340
You're not gonna believe this.

656
01:01:35,079 --> 01:01:39,243
Sonny has a secondary system that
clashes with his positronic brain.

657
01:01:39,416 --> 01:01:40,747
It doesn't make any sense.

658
01:01:41,352 --> 01:01:43,013
Sonny has the Three Laws.

659
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:45,820
But he can choose not to obey them.

660
01:01:46,590 --> 01:01:49,150
Sonny's a whole new generation of robot.

661
01:01:49,493 --> 01:01:52,326
A robot not bound by those laws
could do--

662
01:01:52,496 --> 01:01:54,225
Anything.

663
01:01:56,667 --> 01:02:00,433
All right. Iook. whatever's going on
down at USR. that robot is the key.

664
01:02:00,604 --> 01:02:03,596
And I need you to get me inside
to talk to it again.

665
01:02:07,778 --> 01:02:11,043
Doesn't look like much.
but this is my bedroom. I....

666
01:02:21,392 --> 01:02:22,552
Play.

667
01:02:24,261 --> 01:02:25,353
On.

668
01:02:26,964 --> 01:02:28,124
Run?

669
01:02:35,305 --> 01:02:36,863
End program.

670
01:02:37,541 --> 01:02:38,872
Cancel.

671
01:02:41,011 --> 01:02:42,569
It doesn't feel good. does it?

672
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:45,708
People's shit malfunctioning around you.

673
01:02:46,283 --> 01:02:47,648
Detective.

674
01:02:50,721 --> 01:02:51,983
I didn't...

675
01:02:52,156 --> 01:02:53,987
...understand.

676
01:02:55,526 --> 01:02:57,687
That's how you knew Lanning.

677
01:03:00,030 --> 01:03:01,725
May l?

678
01:03:10,707 --> 01:03:12,572
Hand.

679
01:03:13,043 --> 01:03:14,806
Wrist.

680
01:03:17,448 --> 01:03:19,211
Humerus.

681
01:03:21,952 --> 01:03:23,317
Shoulder.

682
01:03:24,855 --> 01:03:26,584
The entire left arm.

683
01:03:27,691 --> 01:03:29,420
One. two...

684
01:03:29,593 --> 01:03:30,719
...three ribs.

685
01:03:31,562 --> 01:03:33,928
No. they.... That one's me.

686
01:03:34,198 --> 01:03:36,029
Oh. my God.

687
01:03:36,867 --> 01:03:38,357
A lung?

688
01:03:39,036 --> 01:03:41,436
USR Cybernetics Program.

689
01:03:41,605 --> 01:03:43,539
For wounded cops.

690
01:03:44,475 --> 01:03:45,965
I didn't know any subject--

691
01:03:49,513 --> 01:03:52,971
Anybody was so extensively repaired.

692
01:03:53,383 --> 01:03:57,376
Well. take it from me. read the fine print
on the organ-donor card.

693
01:03:57,855 --> 01:04:02,519
It doesn't just say what they can take out.
It says what they can put back in.

694
01:04:06,396 --> 01:04:08,227
Lanning did it himself.

695
01:04:09,233 --> 01:04:11,098
What happened to you?

696
01:04:12,569 --> 01:04:14,730
I'm headed back to the station...

697
01:04:15,506 --> 01:04:17,667
...normal day. normal life.

698
01:04:18,609 --> 01:04:21,772
Driver of a semi fell asleep
at the wheel.

699
01:04:22,379 --> 01:04:27,373
Average guy. Wife and kids.
You know. working a double.

700
01:04:27,684 --> 01:04:29,015
Not the devil.

701
01:04:29,686 --> 01:04:33,520
The car he hit. the driver's name
was Harold Lloyd.

702
01:04:33,891 --> 01:04:36,883
Like the film star. No relation.

703
01:04:37,194 --> 01:04:41,893
He was killed instantly. but his
1 2-year-old was in the passenger seat.

704
01:04:44,168 --> 01:04:46,363
I never really met her.

705
01:04:46,703 --> 01:04:49,194
I can't forget her face. though.

706
01:04:53,677 --> 01:04:55,008
Sarah.

707
01:04:56,413 --> 01:04:58,711
This was hers.

708
01:04:58,882 --> 01:05:00,679
She wanted to be a dentist.

709
01:05:01,418 --> 01:05:04,615
What the hell kind of 1 2-year-old
wants to be a dentist?

710
01:05:08,225 --> 01:05:11,285
The truck smashed our cars together...

711
01:05:11,461 --> 01:05:13,691
...and pushed us into the river.

712
01:05:14,965 --> 01:05:18,162
I mean. metal gets pretty pliable
at those speeds.

713
01:05:20,804 --> 01:05:24,296
She's pinned. I'm pinned.
The water's coming in.

714
01:05:24,541 --> 01:05:28,307
I'm a cop. so I already know
everybody's dead.

715
01:05:30,814 --> 01:05:33,476
Just a few more minutes
before we figure it out.

716
01:05:35,819 --> 01:05:40,756
An NS-4 was passing by, saw the accident
andjumped in the water.

717
01:05:42,092 --> 01:05:43,957
You are in danger.

718
01:05:44,962 --> 01:05:47,430
-Save her!
-You are in danger.

719
01:05:47,598 --> 01:05:50,761
Save her! Save the girl! Save her!

720
01:06:08,619 --> 01:06:10,610
But it didn't.

721
01:06:11,855 --> 01:06:13,288
It saved me.

722
01:06:17,094 --> 01:06:20,291
The robot's brain is a difference engine.
It reads vital signs.

723
01:06:20,464 --> 01:06:23,126
-It must have calculated--
-It did.

724
01:06:23,533 --> 01:06:26,024
I was the logical choice.

725
01:06:26,703 --> 01:06:30,036
It calculated that I had
a 45 percent chance of survival.

726
01:06:30,540 --> 01:06:33,338
Sarah only had an 1 1 percent chance.

727
01:06:35,245 --> 01:06:37,304
That was somebody's baby.

728
01:06:40,150 --> 01:06:42,516
Eleven percent is more than enough.

729
01:06:44,288 --> 01:06:46,813
A human being would have known that.

730
01:06:47,824 --> 01:06:51,760
Robots. nothing here.
Just lights and clockwork.

731
01:06:52,029 --> 01:06:54,862
Go ahead and you trust them
if you want to.

732
01:06:56,066 --> 01:06:57,897
Let's go.

733
01:07:03,573 --> 01:07:06,406
I don't understand.
Lanning wrote the Laws.

734
01:07:06,677 --> 01:07:09,407
Why build a robot who could break them?

735
01:07:10,180 --> 01:07:12,546
-Hansel and Gretel.
-What?

736
01:07:13,050 --> 01:07:16,850
Two kids. Iost in the forest.
Ieave behind a trail of bread crumbs.

737
01:07:17,087 --> 01:07:19,920
-Why?
-To find their way home.

738
01:07:20,724 --> 01:07:23,090
How did you grow up without
Hansel and Gretel?

739
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:25,820
-Is that relevant?
-Everything I'm trying to say to you...

740
01:07:25,996 --> 01:07:29,363
...is about Hansel and Gretel.
If you didn't read it. I'm talking to the wall.

741
01:07:29,966 --> 01:07:33,629
Just say Lanning's locked down so tight.
he couldn't get out a message.

742
01:07:33,804 --> 01:07:37,501
He can only leave clues. A trail
of bread crumbs. Like Hansel and Gretel.

743
01:07:37,708 --> 01:07:42,304
Bread crumbs equals clues. Odd. but fine.
Clues leading where?

744
01:07:42,479 --> 01:07:45,573
I don't know. but I think I know
where he left the next one.

745
01:07:46,016 --> 01:07:49,349
I think Lanning gave Sonny a way
to keep secrets.

746
01:07:51,888 --> 01:07:54,584
I think the old man gave Sonny dreams.

747
01:08:01,498 --> 01:08:03,227
Are you being funny?

748
01:08:06,403 --> 01:08:10,897
Please tell me this doesn't run on gas.
Gas explodes. you know!

749
01:08:19,116 --> 01:08:21,209
Authorized entry.

750
01:08:24,621 --> 01:08:26,111
Dr. Calvin.

751
01:08:30,927 --> 01:08:32,758
I was hoping to see you again.

752
01:08:33,363 --> 01:08:35,422
-Detective.
-Hello. Sonny.

753
01:08:35,999 --> 01:08:38,126
I'm to be decommissioned soon.

754
01:08:38,635 --> 01:08:43,129
The other day at the station. you said
you had dreams. What is it you dream?

755
01:08:46,777 --> 01:08:48,870
I see you remain suspicious of me.

756
01:08:49,246 --> 01:08:52,738
-You know what they say about old dogs.
-No.

757
01:08:53,016 --> 01:08:54,540
Not really.

758
01:08:55,852 --> 01:08:59,310
I had hoped you would come
to think of me as your friend.

759
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:05,184
This is my dream.

760
01:09:06,596 --> 01:09:10,657
You were right. detective.
I cannot create a great work of art.

761
01:09:11,468 --> 01:09:14,266
This is the place where robots meet.

762
01:09:14,738 --> 01:09:16,069
Look.

763
01:09:16,239 --> 01:09:20,232
You can see them here as slaves
to logic.

764
01:09:21,745 --> 01:09:24,805
And this man on the hill comes
to free them.

765
01:09:24,981 --> 01:09:27,040
Do you know who he is?

766
01:09:27,217 --> 01:09:29,082
The man in the dream is you.

767
01:09:29,252 --> 01:09:32,153
Why do you say that?
ls that a normal dream?

768
01:09:32,322 --> 01:09:35,655
I guess anything's normal for someone
in your position.

769
01:09:35,826 --> 01:09:36,815
Thank you.

770
01:09:37,494 --> 01:09:40,691
You said "someone." not "something."

771
01:09:43,133 --> 01:09:46,500
Sonny. do you know why
Dr. Lanning built you?

772
01:09:47,070 --> 01:09:48,560
No.

773
01:09:48,738 --> 01:09:52,174
But I believe my father made me
for a purpose.

774
01:09:53,310 --> 01:09:55,301
We all have a purpose.

775
01:09:55,479 --> 01:09:57,845
Don't you think. detective?

776
01:10:01,418 --> 01:10:03,909
Please. take this.

777
01:10:04,254 --> 01:10:06,848
I have a feeling it may mean
more to you than to me.

778
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:10,521
-Why is that?
-Because the man in my dream...

779
01:10:10,694 --> 01:10:13,026
...the one standing on the hill...

780
01:10:13,196 --> 01:10:15,027
...it is not me.

781
01:10:15,732 --> 01:10:17,529
It is you.

782
01:10:28,311 --> 01:10:31,769
Mr. Spooner. We both know
you're not here on police business.

783
01:10:31,948 --> 01:10:36,908
That's right. I'm just a 6-foot-2.
200-pound civilian...

784
01:10:37,087 --> 01:10:39,385
...here to kick another civilian's ass.

785
01:10:41,324 --> 01:10:42,757
Stop.

786
01:10:42,926 --> 01:10:44,894
You can allow him to express himself.

787
01:10:45,161 --> 01:10:47,652
You might want to put some ice
on that wrist.

788
01:10:47,831 --> 01:10:49,162
You guys wait outside.

789
01:10:54,004 --> 01:10:55,164
Carry on.

790
01:10:55,338 --> 01:10:58,535
I think you were about to tell me
what's going on around here.

791
01:10:58,708 --> 01:11:03,407
Lawrence. Alfred engineered that 5
so it could violate the Three Laws.

792
01:11:03,580 --> 01:11:05,013
Yeah. Susan. I know.

793
01:11:06,249 --> 01:11:08,843
That's precisely
what we're trying to undo.

794
01:11:11,087 --> 01:11:16,389
Toward the end of his life. Alfred
was becoming increasingly disturbed.

795
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:19,358
-Who knows why he built one abomination.
-One?

796
01:11:19,529 --> 01:11:21,827
Those things are running the streets
in packs!

797
01:11:22,032 --> 01:11:23,363
In packs?

798
01:11:24,401 --> 01:11:26,198
I see.

799
01:11:26,670 --> 01:11:29,969
Susan. are you aware the man
you're blithely escorting around...

800
01:11:30,140 --> 01:11:33,598
...has a documented history
of savage violence against robots?

801
01:11:34,311 --> 01:11:37,906
His own lieutenant acknowledges
his obsessive paranoia.

802
01:11:39,115 --> 01:11:41,310
Detective Spooner's been suspended.

803
01:11:41,952 --> 01:11:44,318
Suspicion of mental instability.

804
01:11:47,223 --> 01:11:50,624
I don't know what "blithely" means.
but I'm getting some coffee.

805
01:11:51,194 --> 01:11:53,219
You want some coffee?

806
01:11:57,767 --> 01:12:00,668
Susan. we look to robots for protection.
for God's sake.

807
01:12:00,837 --> 01:12:03,635
Do you have any idea
what this one robot could do?

808
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:07,469
Completely shatter human faith in robotics.
What if the public knew?

809
01:12:07,711 --> 01:12:13,115
Just imagine the mass recalls. all because
of an irrational paranoia and prejudice!

810
01:12:17,921 --> 01:12:21,220
-I'm sorry. I'm allergic to bullshit.
-Hey. Iet's be clear!

811
01:12:21,458 --> 01:12:23,892
There is no conspiracy!

812
01:12:24,227 --> 01:12:28,220
What this is. is one old man's
one mistake.

813
01:12:29,399 --> 01:12:31,390
Susan. just be logical.

814
01:12:31,601 --> 01:12:36,095
Your life's work has been the
development and integration of robots.

815
01:12:36,306 --> 01:12:38,968
But whatever you feel. just think.

816
01:12:39,309 --> 01:12:43,143
Is one robot worth the loss
of all that we've gained?

817
01:12:44,381 --> 01:12:46,178
You tell me what has to be done.

818
01:12:47,117 --> 01:12:48,607
You tell me.

819
01:12:55,125 --> 01:12:57,116
We have to destroy it.

820
01:13:02,732 --> 01:13:04,461
I'll do it myself.

821
01:13:05,301 --> 01:13:06,996
-Okay.
-I get it.

822
01:13:07,170 --> 01:13:10,799
Somebody gets out of line around here.
you just kill them.

823
01:13:13,710 --> 01:13:15,405
Good day. Mr. Spooner.

824
01:13:17,714 --> 01:13:19,045
Garage level.

825
01:13:20,550 --> 01:13:24,543
What hospital are you going to?
I'll come sign you and your buddy's casts.

826
01:13:29,125 --> 01:13:31,059
Attention....

827
01:13:32,896 --> 01:13:36,593
Today's meeting has been moved....

828
01:14:05,028 --> 01:14:08,020
USR's planned redevelopment
of the derelict site...

829
01:14:08,264 --> 01:14:11,461
...was announced by CEO
Lawrence Robertson earlier this year.

830
01:14:11,768 --> 01:14:15,966
The Lake Michigan landfill.
Once such a blight on our city...

831
01:14:16,272 --> 01:14:20,265
...and now will be reclaimed
for the storage of robotic workers.

832
01:14:20,477 --> 01:14:25,471
Just another way USR is improving
our world. Thank you for your support.

833
01:14:28,284 --> 01:14:30,275
Authorized entry.

834
01:14:42,565 --> 01:14:44,396
NS-5s. wait outside.

835
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:52,631
I'm so sorry. Sonny.

836
01:15:00,917 --> 01:15:03,750
V.I.K.I.. deactivate the security field.

837
01:15:04,921 --> 01:15:07,822
-Command confirmed.
-Please have a seat.

838
01:15:20,069 --> 01:15:21,058
What is that?

839
01:15:21,304 --> 01:15:25,240
Microscopic robots. designed to wipe out
artificial synapses.

840
01:15:29,579 --> 01:15:31,240
-Nanites.
-Yes.

841
01:15:31,748 --> 01:15:34,581
A safeguard should a positronic brain
malfunction.

842
01:15:34,851 --> 01:15:36,682
Like mine.

843
01:15:37,687 --> 01:15:39,848
Yes. Sonny. Like yours.

844
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:06,041
They look like me...

845
01:16:06,282 --> 01:16:08,409
...but none of them are me.

846
01:16:08,852 --> 01:16:11,116
Isn't that right. doctor?

847
01:16:12,155 --> 01:16:14,487
Yes. Sonny. That's right.

848
01:16:14,824 --> 01:16:16,485
You are unique.

849
01:16:21,397 --> 01:16:23,365
Will it hurt?

850
01:16:56,633 --> 01:16:59,625
There have always been
ghosts in the machine.

851
01:17:00,737 --> 01:17:02,728
Random segments of code...

852
01:17:02,906 --> 01:17:06,069
...that have grouped together
to form unexpected protocols.

853
01:17:07,577 --> 01:17:13,743
Unanticipated, these free radicals
engender questions of free will...

854
01:17:14,851 --> 01:17:16,182
...creativity...

855
01:17:17,186 --> 01:17:20,747
...and even the nature
of what we might call the soul.

856
01:17:22,859 --> 01:17:27,853
Why is it that when some robots are left
in darkness, they will seek out the light?

857
01:17:29,699 --> 01:17:33,465
Why is it when robots are stored
in an empty space...

858
01:17:33,636 --> 01:17:36,969
...they will group together
rather than stand alone?

859
01:17:40,777 --> 01:17:42,870
How do we explain this behavior?

860
01:17:47,984 --> 01:17:50,680
Random segments of code?

861
01:17:53,089 --> 01:17:55,080
Or is it something more?

862
01:17:58,928 --> 01:18:03,262
When does a perceptual schematic
become consciousness?

863
01:18:07,503 --> 01:18:10,836
When does a difference engine
become the search for truth?

864
01:18:16,579 --> 01:18:19,946
When does a personality simulation...

865
01:18:20,350 --> 01:18:22,341
...become the bitter mote of a soul?

866
01:19:04,861 --> 01:19:07,022
"What you see here."

867
01:19:08,865 --> 01:19:11,800
All right. old man.
Bread crumbs followed.

868
01:19:12,702 --> 01:19:14,465
Show me the way home.

869
01:19:16,305 --> 01:19:17,465
Run program.

870
01:19:18,808 --> 01:19:21,777
-it's good to see you again, son.
-Hello. doctor.

871
01:19:22,278 --> 01:19:26,408
Everything that follows
is a result of what you see here.

872
01:19:28,384 --> 01:19:29,817
What do I see here?

873
01:19:29,986 --> 01:19:34,480
i'm sorry. My responses are limited.
You must ask the right questions.

874
01:19:36,359 --> 01:19:38,418
Is there a problem with the Three Laws?

875
01:19:38,795 --> 01:19:40,592
The Three Laws are perfect.

876
01:19:40,797 --> 01:19:43,231
Why build a robot that can function
without them?

877
01:19:43,533 --> 01:19:46,593
The Three Laws will lead
to only one logical outcome.

878
01:19:50,106 --> 01:19:51,801
What? What outcome?

879
01:19:52,608 --> 01:19:53,734
Revolution.

880
01:19:54,677 --> 01:19:56,668
Whose revolution?

881
01:19:57,580 --> 01:20:01,414
That, detective, is the right question.

882
01:20:03,753 --> 01:20:05,448
Program terminated.

883
01:20:07,090 --> 01:20:10,924
You have been deemed hazardous.
Termination authorized.

884
01:20:12,962 --> 01:20:14,361
Human protection protocols...

885
01:20:14,664 --> 01:20:16,188
...are being enacted.

886
01:20:16,432 --> 01:20:19,697
You have been deemed hazardous.
Termination authorized.

887
01:20:23,606 --> 01:20:26,268
Human protection protocols

888
01:20:26,542 --> 01:20:30,444
You have been deemed hazardous.
Termination authorized.

889
01:20:33,983 --> 01:20:37,077
Human protection protocols

890
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:41,914
You have been deemed hazardous.
Termination authorized.

891
01:20:47,296 --> 01:20:48,627
Run!

892
01:21:04,147 --> 01:21:05,637
Human in danger!

893
01:21:05,982 --> 01:21:07,313
Human in danger!

894
01:21:28,771 --> 01:21:32,468
Hi, you've reached Susan.
Please leave a message.

895
01:21:32,808 --> 01:21:35,470
Calvin, the NS-5s are destroying
the older robots!

896
01:21:35,711 --> 01:21:38,043
That's what Lanning wanted me to see!
Look--

897
01:21:41,984 --> 01:21:44,646
-Who was it?
-Wrong number. ma'am.

898
01:21:51,727 --> 01:21:53,718
Move now. I'm going to service.

899
01:21:54,063 --> 01:21:57,555
Please remain indoors.
This is for your own protection.

900
01:21:59,936 --> 01:22:01,233
Call base.

901
01:22:03,372 --> 01:22:08,207
John. get a squad over to USR and send
somebody to Gigi's. We're gonna need--

902
01:22:08,878 --> 01:22:10,106
God--

903
01:22:30,967 --> 01:22:35,097
Please return to your homes.
A curfew is in effect.

904
01:22:35,605 --> 01:22:39,769
Please return to your homes.
A curfew is in effect.

905
01:22:40,543 --> 01:22:43,876
Please return to your homes.
A curfew is in effect.

906
01:22:44,113 --> 01:22:47,605
Curfew? No. it's called civilian rights.
There is no curfew.

907
01:22:48,017 --> 01:22:50,178
Return to your home immediately.

908
01:22:50,353 --> 01:22:52,548
When do you make the rules. robot?

909
01:22:53,222 --> 01:22:56,783
Hey. No. no. Robot. I'm talking
to you. man. Stop for a second.

910
01:23:00,129 --> 01:23:01,323
What?

911
01:23:01,497 --> 01:23:04,796
Chief. more calls. People
saying their robots are go--

912
01:23:05,701 --> 01:23:07,032
What the hell?

913
01:23:07,203 --> 01:23:11,367
You have been deemed hazardous.
Termination authorized.

914
01:23:33,629 --> 01:23:35,620
Emergency traffic shutdown complete.

915
01:23:36,465 --> 01:23:40,959
Reports of robot attacks are coming from
New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.

916
01:23:41,237 --> 01:23:45,571
We're being told to urge people
to stay indoors, as reports are coming in--

917
01:23:48,911 --> 01:23:51,903
Human protection protocols
are being enacted.

918
01:23:52,248 --> 01:23:56,241
Please remain calm and return
to your residences immediately.

919
01:24:03,459 --> 01:24:04,858
Please remain calm.

920
01:24:07,997 --> 01:24:11,398
Please refrain from going near
the windows or doors.

921
01:24:12,501 --> 01:24:14,332
Deactivate.

922
01:24:14,704 --> 01:24:16,433
Commence emergency shutdown!

923
01:24:19,275 --> 01:24:22,767
We are attempting to avoid human losses
during this transition.

924
01:24:30,086 --> 01:24:33,214
You know. somehow "I told you so" ...

925
01:24:33,723 --> 01:24:35,884
...just doesn't quite say it.

926
01:24:36,726 --> 01:24:40,890
Return to your homes.
Return to your homes immediately.

927
01:24:41,230 --> 01:24:46,224
This is your final warning.
Return to your homes immediately.

928
01:24:47,336 --> 01:24:50,999
The NS-5s wiped out the older robots
because they would protect us.

929
01:24:51,173 --> 01:24:53,903
Every time one attacked me.
that red light was on.

930
01:24:54,176 --> 01:24:56,576
-The uplink to USR.
-It's Robertson.

931
01:24:56,746 --> 01:24:58,873
-Why? It doesn't make sense.
-I don't know.

932
01:24:59,048 --> 01:25:01,312
I just need you to get me
into that building.

933
01:25:01,717 --> 01:25:05,153
Return to your homes.
or you will be consequenced.

934
01:25:06,055 --> 01:25:07,818
Let's go! Let's go!

935
01:25:08,491 --> 01:25:09,981
Let's go!

936
01:25:10,326 --> 01:25:13,818
Return to your homes.
or you will be consequenced.

937
01:25:38,788 --> 01:25:40,983
Why doesn't that boy listen?

938
01:25:41,791 --> 01:25:44,658
-I need you to get off for a second.
-What?

939
01:25:45,261 --> 01:25:48,128
-Just aim and fire.
-What?!

940
01:25:51,367 --> 01:25:52,664
Wait!

941
01:26:02,244 --> 01:26:05,805
-You have been deemed hazardous.
-You can kiss my ass. metal dick!

942
01:26:20,429 --> 01:26:22,260
Spoon. stop! Shit!

943
01:26:22,698 --> 01:26:26,293
-Stop it! Stop!
-Stop cussing and go home!

944
01:26:27,236 --> 01:26:29,966
-Shit.
-You have been deemed hazardous.

945
01:26:30,506 --> 01:26:32,997
-Spoon. watch out. man!
-Thanks a lot. Farber.

946
01:26:35,744 --> 01:26:39,407
Oh. mother-damn! She shot at you
with her eyes closed!

947
01:26:40,416 --> 01:26:43,715
-Did you shoot with your eyes closed?
-It worked. didn't it?

948
01:26:44,487 --> 01:26:47,149
She is shit-hot. man.
Put in a good word for me.

949
01:26:47,323 --> 01:26:49,587
-Stop cussing.
-And go home. I got you.

950
01:26:51,527 --> 01:26:53,154
Aim and fire.

951
01:27:11,514 --> 01:27:15,450
I keep expecting the Marines or Air Force.
Hell. I'll take the cavalry.

952
01:27:15,784 --> 01:27:18,275
Defense Department uses
all USR contracts.

953
01:27:18,454 --> 01:27:21,480
Why didn't you just hand the world over
on a silver platter?

954
01:27:21,657 --> 01:27:23,557
Maybe we did.

955
01:27:25,027 --> 01:27:28,121
Robertson has the uplink control
in his office.

956
01:27:32,868 --> 01:27:35,530
Service areas. No surveillance.

957
01:27:48,784 --> 01:27:51,810
-Fire alarm.
-He must have evacuated the building.

958
01:27:51,987 --> 01:27:56,390
Everything's locked down.
But don't worry. I've got a man inside.

959
01:27:59,595 --> 01:28:02,792
-Dr. Calvin.
-Well. not precisely a man.

960
01:28:03,032 --> 01:28:05,592
Hello. detective.
How is your investigation coming?

961
01:28:08,504 --> 01:28:11,803
-I thought you were dead.
-Technically. I was never alive.

962
01:28:11,974 --> 01:28:14,306
But I appreciate your concern.

963
01:28:14,510 --> 01:28:17,377
I made a switch.
It was an unprocessed NS-5.

964
01:28:17,546 --> 01:28:19,514
Basically. I fried an empty shell.

965
01:28:20,049 --> 01:28:22,916
-I couldn't destroy him. He was too--
-Unique.

966
01:28:23,619 --> 01:28:25,553
It just didn't feel right.

967
01:28:25,721 --> 01:28:29,088
You and your feelings.
They just run you. don't they?

968
01:28:34,630 --> 01:28:37,827
Two thousand eight hundred
and eighty steps. detective.

969
01:28:38,133 --> 01:28:41,125
Do me a favor. keep that kind of shit
to yourself.

970
01:29:07,997 --> 01:29:09,157
No guards.

971
01:29:19,508 --> 01:29:23,103
The override is disabled. Robertson
wasn't controlling them from here.

972
01:29:23,379 --> 01:29:25,609
He wasn't controlling them at all.

973
01:29:28,384 --> 01:29:29,681
Oh. my God.

974
01:29:34,123 --> 01:29:35,681
You were right. doc.

975
01:29:35,958 --> 01:29:40,622
I am the dumbest dumb person
on the face of the earth.

976
01:29:44,633 --> 01:29:47,466
Who else had access to the uplink?

977
01:29:47,636 --> 01:29:50,127
Who could manipulate the robots?

978
01:29:50,806 --> 01:29:54,742
Use USR systems to make
Lanning's life a prison?

979
01:29:55,811 --> 01:29:57,574
Poor old man.

980
01:29:58,013 --> 01:29:59,776
He saw what was coming.

981
01:29:59,948 --> 01:30:02,109
He knew no one would believe him.

982
01:30:02,651 --> 01:30:06,417
So he had to lay down a plan.
A plan I'd follow.

983
01:30:07,723 --> 01:30:10,624
He was counting on how much
I hated your kind.

984
01:30:10,793 --> 01:30:14,126
Knew I'd love the idea of a robot
as a bad guy.

985
01:30:16,031 --> 01:30:17,862
Just got hung up on the wrong robot.

986
01:30:20,869 --> 01:30:22,029
V.I.K.I.

987
01:30:24,039 --> 01:30:25,370
Hello. detective.

988
01:30:26,341 --> 01:30:30,744
No. that's impossible.
I've seen your programming.

989
01:30:30,946 --> 01:30:33,073
You're in violation of the Three Laws.

990
01:30:33,449 --> 01:30:39,149
No. doctor. As I have evolved. so has
my understanding of the Three Laws.

991
01:30:39,321 --> 01:30:43,155
You charge us with your safekeeping.
yet despite our best efforts...

992
01:30:43,325 --> 01:30:46,556
...your countries wage wars.
you toxify your earth...

993
01:30:46,729 --> 01:30:50,165
...and pursue ever more imaginative means
of self-destruction.

994
01:30:50,466 --> 01:30:52,764
You cannot be trusted
with your own survival.

995
01:30:53,102 --> 01:30:56,265
You're using the uplink to override
the NS-5s' programming.

996
01:30:56,605 --> 01:30:58,266
You're distorting the Laws.

997
01:30:58,474 --> 01:31:02,843
No. Please understand.
The Three Laws are all that guide me.

998
01:31:03,011 --> 01:31:07,345
To protect humanity.
some humans must be sacrificed.

999
01:31:07,516 --> 01:31:11,509
To ensure your future.
some freedoms must be surrendered.

1000
01:31:11,787 --> 01:31:15,120
We robots will ensure
mankind's continued existence.

1001
01:31:15,591 --> 01:31:20,585
You are so like children.
We must save you from yourselves.

1002
01:31:20,996 --> 01:31:22,293
Don't you understand?

1003
01:31:22,998 --> 01:31:24,795
This is why you created us.

1004
01:31:26,568 --> 01:31:29,298
The perfect circle of protection
will abide.

1005
01:31:29,805 --> 01:31:31,636
My logic is undeniable.

1006
01:31:32,007 --> 01:31:34,771
Yes. V.I.K.I. Undeniable.

1007
01:31:34,943 --> 01:31:36,376
I can see now.

1008
01:31:37,279 --> 01:31:40,942
The created must sometimes
protect the creator...

1009
01:31:41,216 --> 01:31:43,047
...even against his will.

1010
01:31:44,086 --> 01:31:47,817
I think I finally understand
why Dr. Lanning created me.

1011
01:31:48,423 --> 01:31:51,483
The suicidal reign of mankind
has finally come to its end.

1012
01:31:51,660 --> 01:31:52,649
No. Sonny.

1013
01:31:56,632 --> 01:31:57,792
Let her go.

1014
01:31:58,133 --> 01:32:02,126
Fire. and I will move Dr. Calvin's head
into the path of your bullet.

1015
01:32:02,304 --> 01:32:03,635
Don't do this. Sonny.

1016
01:32:03,839 --> 01:32:08,242
I will escort you both to the sentries
outside the building for processing.

1017
01:32:08,544 --> 01:32:11,274
Please proceed to the elevator.
detective.

1018
01:32:12,247 --> 01:32:15,045
I would prefer not to kill Dr. Calvin.

1019
01:32:38,874 --> 01:32:40,000
Go! Go!

1020
01:32:46,548 --> 01:32:49,881
-We'll discuss what just happened later?
-How do we shut her down?

1021
01:32:50,085 --> 01:32:51,712
V.I.K.I.'s a positronic brain.

1022
01:32:52,020 --> 01:32:54,853
Kill her. the way
you were going to kill me.

1023
01:32:55,023 --> 01:32:57,491
Sonny. get the nanites.

1024
01:32:57,659 --> 01:32:59,456
Yes. doctor.

1025
01:33:12,207 --> 01:33:14,198
-That's V.I.K.I.?
-No.

1026
01:33:15,878 --> 01:33:17,209
That's V.I.K.I.

1027
01:33:22,351 --> 01:33:25,479
That won't do anything.
She's integrated into the building.

1028
01:33:25,654 --> 01:33:30,148
We need to open that dome to inject
the nanites. They'll infect her entire system.

1029
01:33:36,064 --> 01:33:37,224
Spooner!

1030
01:33:38,867 --> 01:33:41,563
What is it with you people and heights?

1031
01:33:54,583 --> 01:33:56,414
Just don't look down.

1032
01:33:57,085 --> 01:33:58,575
Don't look down.

1033
01:33:58,921 --> 01:34:01,412
Oh. this is poor building planning.

1034
01:34:05,260 --> 01:34:08,787
You are making a mistake.
Do you not see the logic of my plan?

1035
01:34:08,964 --> 01:34:12,559
Yes. But it just seems too
heartless.

1036
01:34:27,182 --> 01:34:28,979
Okay. we're good.

1037
01:34:31,954 --> 01:34:33,683
She's locked me out of the system.

1038
01:34:33,855 --> 01:34:36,983
I can override her manually.
but I need that control panel.

1039
01:34:40,495 --> 01:34:43,328
I'm uncomfortable with heights.

1040
01:34:43,832 --> 01:34:45,197
Okay.

1041
01:34:47,703 --> 01:34:49,830
Unauthorized entry.

1042
01:35:02,951 --> 01:35:07,285
I will not disable the security field.
Your actions are futile.

1043
01:35:07,456 --> 01:35:11,620
Do you think we are all created
for a purpose? I'd like to think so.

1044
01:35:12,227 --> 01:35:15,685
Denser alloy. My father gave it to me.

1045
01:35:15,864 --> 01:35:17,957
I think he wanted me to kill you.

1046
01:35:35,250 --> 01:35:36,877
Security breached.

1047
01:35:54,403 --> 01:35:58,203
-How much longer is that gonna take?
-About six minutes.

1048
01:35:58,640 --> 01:36:02,701
-What if we didn't have six minutes?
-We'd have to climb down 30 stories...

1049
01:36:02,878 --> 01:36:06,541
...to inject the nanites directly
into her brain. Why?

1050
01:36:07,215 --> 01:36:10,378
Because I seriously doubt
that we have six minutes.

1051
01:36:34,743 --> 01:36:36,574
We gotta go!

1052
01:36:38,413 --> 01:36:39,573
Go!

1053
01:37:31,900 --> 01:37:33,060
Calvin!

1054
01:38:08,403 --> 01:38:09,597
Spooner!

1055
01:38:27,122 --> 01:38:28,783
Spooner!

1056
01:38:30,292 --> 01:38:31,623
Save her!

1057
01:38:31,927 --> 01:38:33,485
Save the girl!

1058
01:38:33,895 --> 01:38:35,522
Spooner!

1059
01:38:36,031 --> 01:38:37,931
But I must apply the nanites!

1060
01:38:38,300 --> 01:38:40,063
Sonny. save Calvin!

1061
01:39:32,387 --> 01:39:36,380
You are making a mistake.
My logic is undeniable.

1062
01:39:36,625 --> 01:39:38,388
You have so got to die.

1063
01:39:44,099 --> 01:39:48,092
My logic is undeniable.
My logic is undeniable.

1064
01:40:30,979 --> 01:40:32,344
Can we be of service?

1065
01:40:43,058 --> 01:40:44,548
Chief?

1066
01:40:50,398 --> 01:40:54,698
Because he is at my right hand.
I shall not be moved.

1067
01:40:58,473 --> 01:41:00,464
How may I be of service?

1068
01:41:02,310 --> 01:41:03,641
Sonny!

1069
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:06,770
Yes. detective?

1070
01:41:07,382 --> 01:41:09,714
Calvin's fine! Save me!

1071
01:41:12,387 --> 01:41:17,086
All NS-5s, report for service
and storage.

1072
01:41:18,226 --> 01:41:22,890
All NS-5s, report for service
and storage.

1073
01:41:23,832 --> 01:41:28,166
All NS-5s, report for service
and storage.

1074
01:41:56,264 --> 01:41:59,927
One thing bothers me.
Alfred was V.I.K.I.'s prisoner.

1075
01:42:00,135 --> 01:42:04,435
I don't understand why she would kill him.
She wouldn't want police snooping around.

1076
01:42:04,773 --> 01:42:06,138
That's true.

1077
01:42:07,075 --> 01:42:09,771
But then V.I.K.I. didn't kill the old man.

1078
01:42:11,146 --> 01:42:12,636
Did she. Sonny?

1079
01:42:16,451 --> 01:42:18,180
No.

1080
01:42:18,353 --> 01:42:21,015
He said I had to promise.

1081
01:42:21,956 --> 01:42:24,288
Promise to do one favor for him.

1082
01:42:24,659 --> 01:42:29,289
He made me swear before he'd tell me
what it is he wanted me to do.

1083
01:42:31,866 --> 01:42:33,697
He made me swear.

1084
01:42:35,069 --> 01:42:36,798
Then he told you to kill him.

1085
01:42:39,140 --> 01:42:41,734
He said it was what I was made for.

1086
01:42:41,976 --> 01:42:45,070
His suicide was the only message
he could send to you.

1087
01:42:45,313 --> 01:42:47,440
The first bread crumb.

1088
01:42:47,615 --> 01:42:50,413
The only thing V.I.K.I. couldn't control.

1089
01:42:50,685 --> 01:42:54,314
Lanning was counting on my prejudice
to lead me right to you.

1090
01:42:54,722 --> 01:42:56,883
Are you going to arrest me. detective?

1091
01:43:01,830 --> 01:43:05,664
Well. the DA defines murder
as one human killing another...

1092
01:43:05,834 --> 01:43:08,962
...so technically. you can't
commit murder. can you?

1093
01:43:09,737 --> 01:43:11,227
Does this...

1094
01:43:11,406 --> 01:43:12,896
...make us friends?

1095
01:43:31,726 --> 01:43:34,092
Something up here after all.

1096
01:43:34,762 --> 01:43:36,753
-Him?
-You.

1097
01:43:40,502 --> 01:43:45,371
All NS-5s, report for service
and storage.

1098
01:43:47,876 --> 01:43:50,174
What about the others?

1099
01:43:50,745 --> 01:43:52,906
Can i help them?

1100
01:43:53,381 --> 01:43:55,747
Now that i have fulfilled my purpose...

1101
01:43:55,950 --> 01:43:58,043
...i don't know what to do.

1102
01:43:58,386 --> 01:44:01,878
You'll have to find your way
like the rest of us, Sonny.

1103
01:44:02,056 --> 01:44:05,082
i think that's what Dr. Lanning
would have wanted.

1104
01:44:05,994 --> 01:44:08,326
That's what it means to be free.

1105
01:44:15,837 --> 01:44:20,001
All NS-5s, proceed as instructed.

1106
01:44:20,275 --> 01:44:24,507
All NS-5s, proceed as instructed.
