he has a little over an hour.

808
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,905
Take me out of here!

809
00:49:53,658 --> 00:49:57,702
You were the guardian!
You know all about this tablet.

810
00:49:57,787 --> 00:50:00,997
You're obviously much more
clever than the rest of us.

811

You may or may not
know the combination,

812
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:06,503

one hour to figure it out.

813

kill your friends.

about escaping,

815
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:13,593
for I shall be
watching you.

816
00:50:13,678 --> 00:50:15,470

know how to begin

817
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:17,722
to decipher this thing,
all right? Really.

818
00:50:17,807 --> 00:50:19,432
What a pity.

819
00:50:19,517 --> 00:50:23,353

like such a charming little fellow.

I've been worried sick!
Sick I tell you.

827
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:56,553
No, I'm fine.

863
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:32,148
Yes. He has a body.

Oh, dash it, the pain!

865
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,819
- And a horse.
- Excuse me!

Yes, I do, missy.

That's a simple one.

870
00:52:44,078 --> 00:52:48,122
Bird. Man with spear. Sideways fish.
Beetle. Vase.

871
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,834
Okay, and what
does that mean?

872
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:54,003
It means, and this is
just a rough translation,

873
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:59,008
"A man with a spear trapped a bird
and a sideways fish in a vase."

874
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:03,012
"And there was
also a beetle."

875
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:06,224
I don't think that's it.

876
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:08,017
That's just one
possible translation.

877
00:53:08,102 --> 00:53:09,644
Another possible
translation is,

878
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:11,688
"You will find the
combination you seek"

879
00:53:11,772 --> 00:53:15,608
"if you figure out the secret at
the heart of Pharaoh's tomb."

880
00:53:15,985 --> 00:53:17,610
Okay, and what
does that mean?

881
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,820
I don't know!
What am I, the Sphinx?

882
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:21,114

Why don't you ask New York Teddy?

883
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:23,575
I'm sure he'd love to get his grabby
little fingers all over that thing!

884
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:25,285
Probably let his
horse lick it, too!

885
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:27,745
Mr. Daley, we should be going
to the sculpture gallery.

886
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:30,591

might have a better thought on this.

for is just down here.

Hey, excuse me. Could

might miss a rare opportunity.
