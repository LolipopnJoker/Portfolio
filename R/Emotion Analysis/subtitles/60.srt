1
00:00:31,894 --> 00:00:34,573
Start simple. Start with what
you know is the truth.

2
00:00:36,016 --> 00:00:39,804
My name is Katniss Everdeen.
My home is District 12.

3
00:00:40,133 --> 00:00:43,470
I was in the Hunger Games.
I escaped.

4
00:00:43,591 --> 00:00:46,970
Peeta... Peeta was left behind.

5
00:00:50,733 --> 00:00:54,214
Miss Everdeen?
You can't be in here.

6
00:00:56,093 --> 00:00:59,270
I had a nightmare.
Just five more minutes.

7
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:02,654
You need to sleep.
We can help you sleep.

8
00:01:04,054 --> 00:01:05,413
Just five more minutes.

9
00:01:06,373 --> 00:01:07,962
No.

10
00:01:08,584 --> 00:01:12,550
No, please, don't.
It's just five more...

11
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:17,430
Don't touch me! Don't! No!
No! Get off of me!

12
00:02:11,213 --> 00:02:12,492
Finnick.

13
00:02:16,813 --> 00:02:19,002
I wanted to go back for Peeta
and Johanna...

14
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,526
but I, uh...

15
00:02:22,492 --> 00:02:24,579
I couldn't move.

16
00:02:29,012 --> 00:02:32,241
They have Annie, too.
They took her.

17
00:02:34,906 --> 00:02:37,417
She's, uh...

18
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,707
she's in the Capitol.

19
00:02:43,132 --> 00:02:44,773
I wish she was dead.

20
00:02:47,332 --> 00:02:49,772
I wish they were all dead,
and we were, too.

21
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:19,951
Miss Everdeen.

22
00:03:20,051 --> 00:03:22,951
Colonel Boggs, District 13's
head of security.

23
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:24,752
I know you've been discharged...

24
00:03:24,852 --> 00:03:27,032
but President Coin's requested
to meet with you, first.

25
00:03:27,132 --> 00:03:29,032
Is there any news?

26
00:03:29,132 --> 00:03:30,852
I'm just here to escort you.

27
00:04:01,615 --> 00:04:04,835
We were always told there was
nothing left of 13.

28
00:04:04,935 --> 00:04:08,275
Capitol bombed the surface to
rubble...

29
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,935
but we're military, so we learned
to survive, down here.

30
00:04:11,895 --> 00:04:13,656
Preparing, training.

31
00:04:14,936 --> 00:04:16,056
The war never stopped for us.

32
00:04:47,218 --> 00:04:48,218
There she is.

33
00:04:49,178 --> 00:04:51,079
Our Girl on Fire.

34
00:04:51,179 --> 00:04:54,399
Madam President, may I present
you with The Mockingjay.

35
00:04:54,499 --> 00:04:57,359
What an honor it is to meet you.

36
00:04:57,459 --> 00:04:59,079
You're a courageous young woman.

37
00:04:59,179 --> 00:05:01,879
I know how disorienting this
must be.

38
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:03,520
And I can't imagine what it's
like to...

39
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,360
live through the atrocities
of those Games.

40
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,520
Katniss...

41
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,840
President Alma Coin.

42
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,280
Please know how welcome you are.

43
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,561
I hope you'll find some comfort
with us.

44
00:05:14,661 --> 00:05:17,481
We've known loss in 13, too.

45
00:05:17,581 --> 00:05:21,721
This is history.
Right here at this table.

46
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:22,961
I apologize.

47
00:05:23,061 --> 00:05:24,561
I wish you had more time
to recover...

48
00:05:24,661 --> 00:05:26,001
but unfortunately, we don't
have that luxury.

49
00:05:26,101 --> 00:05:27,262
Please, have a seat.

50
00:05:28,622 --> 00:05:30,942
Are you aware of what's
happened?

51
00:05:33,342 --> 00:05:35,662
When you fired your arrow
at the force field...

52
00:05:36,622 --> 00:05:39,123
you electrified the nation.

53
00:05:39,223 --> 00:05:40,923
There have been riots and
uprisings...

54
00:05:41,023 --> 00:05:44,043
and strikes in seven districts.

55
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:46,603
We believe that if we keep
this energy going...

56
00:05:46,703 --> 00:05:49,203
we can unify the districts
against the Capitol.

57
00:05:49,303 --> 00:05:52,004
But if we don't, if we let it
dissipate...

58
00:05:52,104 --> 00:05:55,004
we could be waiting another 75
years for this opportunity.

59
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:57,204
Everyone in 13 is ready for
this.

60
00:05:57,304 --> 00:05:58,804
What about Peeta?
Is he alive?

61
00:05:58,904 --> 00:06:02,364
I don't know.
And I wish that I did.

62
00:06:02,464 --> 00:06:03,565
But there's no way for me
to contact...

63
00:06:03,665 --> 00:06:05,485
my operatives inside the Capitol.

64
00:06:05,585 --> 00:06:07,445
The Capitol has always
suppressed...

65
00:06:07,545 --> 00:06:09,205
communication between the
districts...

66
00:06:09,305 --> 00:06:12,605
but I know their system very
well.

67
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,205
I managed to break through.

68
00:06:14,305 --> 00:06:16,566
All we need now is the perfect
message.

69
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,566
Katniss, here's what we need
to do.

70
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:21,246
We need to show them that the
Mockingjay's alive and well...

71
00:06:21,346 --> 00:06:24,486
and willing to stand up and
join this fight.

72
00:06:24,586 --> 00:06:27,006
'Cause we need every district...

73
00:06:27,106 --> 00:06:28,927
to stand up to this Capitol.

74
00:06:29,027 --> 00:06:31,247
The way you did.

75
00:06:31,347 --> 00:06:36,127
So, we're gonna shoot a series
of propaganda clips...

76
00:06:36,227 --> 00:06:37,767
propos, I like to call them...

77
00:06:37,867 --> 00:06:39,487
on The Mockingjay.

78
00:06:39,587 --> 00:06:41,408
Spreads the word...

79
00:06:41,508 --> 00:06:43,848
that we're gonna stoke the fire
of this rebellion.

80
00:06:43,948 --> 00:06:46,648
The fire that The Mockingjay
started.

81
00:06:46,748 --> 00:06:48,968
You left him there.

82
00:06:49,068 --> 00:06:51,488
You left Peeta in that arena
to die.

83
00:06:51,588 --> 00:06:53,049
Katniss, there are so many...

84
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:54,369
Peeta was the one who was
supposed to live.

85
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:55,409
Miss Everdeen.

86
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,209
This revolution is about everyone.

87
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:02,489
It's about all of us.

88
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:03,749
And we need a voice.

89
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,750
Then you should've saved Peeta.

90
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,671
Maybe you should have rescued
the boy, instead.

91
00:07:17,631 --> 00:07:18,591
Oh, no.

92
00:07:20,751 --> 00:07:24,771
No, listen to me. No one else
can do this, but her.

93
00:07:24,871 --> 00:07:26,151
This is not the girl you
described.

94
00:07:27,911 --> 00:07:30,652
Obviously, we need to make it
personal.

95
00:07:30,752 --> 00:07:32,412
Remind her who the real
enemy is.

96
00:07:32,512 --> 00:07:33,852
She knows who the enemy is.
That's not the issue.

97
00:07:33,952 --> 00:07:35,392
Unless she's forgotten.

98
00:07:37,112 --> 00:07:38,632
There's explaining and there's
showing.

99
00:07:40,472 --> 00:07:43,173
Let her see what the Capitol
did to 12.

100
00:07:43,273 --> 00:07:46,673
She can't handle it.
The Games destroyed her.

101
00:07:48,073 --> 00:07:49,753
This is the only choice you
have.

102
00:07:50,713 --> 00:07:51,933
People don't always show up...

103
00:07:52,033 --> 00:07:53,894
the way you want them to,
Madam President.

104
00:07:53,994 --> 00:07:56,574
But that anger, that anger-driven
defiance...

105
00:07:56,674 --> 00:07:58,854
that's what we want.
And we can redirect it.

106
00:07:58,954 --> 00:08:01,094
We need to unite these people
out there...

107
00:08:01,194 --> 00:08:02,294
that have been doing nothing
but killing each other...

108
00:08:02,394 --> 00:08:04,254
in an arena, for years.

109
00:08:04,354 --> 00:08:07,775
We have to have a lightning rod.

110
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:10,815
They'll follow her. She's the
face of the revolution.

111
00:08:10,915 --> 00:08:12,595
Let her see it.
Let her go home.

112
00:08:15,555 --> 00:08:16,555
Send her.

113
00:08:42,798 --> 00:08:43,958
I can't believe you're going
through with this.

114
00:08:45,638 --> 00:08:47,258
You can say "no."

115
00:08:47,358 --> 00:08:48,638
I need to see it for myself.

116
00:08:50,398 --> 00:08:51,598
This way.

117
00:09:46,323 --> 00:09:48,478
13 swept everything, top to
bottom...

118
00:09:48,578 --> 00:09:49,803
so, you'd be safe.

119
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:54,423
You sure you don't want me to
go with you?

120
00:09:54,523 --> 00:09:56,564
Yeah.
I'm sure.

121
00:10:00,164 --> 00:10:02,084
We'll have our eyes on you
from above.

122
00:13:24,061 --> 00:13:25,963
Figures.

123
00:13:28,781 --> 00:13:30,801
Hey!

124
00:13:30,901 --> 00:13:32,381
Come on.

125
00:13:34,261 --> 00:13:35,261
Don't you wanna see Prim?

126
00:13:36,862 --> 00:13:38,822
There you go.
You're breakin' my heart.

127
00:13:56,423 --> 00:13:57,503
Shh.

128
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,707
Egeria!

129
00:14:51,548 --> 00:14:53,108
We need to fix these lines.

130
00:14:54,388 --> 00:14:56,768
I won't say "rebels."

131
00:14:56,868 --> 00:14:59,848
These are senseless acts
of defiance.

132
00:14:59,948 --> 00:15:01,269
And I won't legitimize them.

133
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,589
We'll call them "criminals."

134
00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:08,549
Mmm.

135
00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:10,289
"Radicals."

136
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:12,409
Hmm.

137
00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:15,750
Otherwise we're breaking my
oldest rule.

138
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,430
Never let them see you bleed.

139
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,810
Citizens...

140
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:29,471
tonight I address all of Panem
as one.

141
00:15:30,831 --> 00:15:33,171
Since the Dark Days...

142
00:15:33,271 --> 00:15:37,011
Panem has had an unprecedented
era of peace.

143
00:15:37,111 --> 00:15:40,372
It is a peace built upon
cooperation.

144
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:44,852
And a respect for law and order.

145
00:15:44,952 --> 00:15:47,132
In the past weeks, you have
heard of sporadic violence...

146
00:15:47,232 --> 00:15:52,413
following the actions of a few
radicals in the Quarter Quell.

147
00:15:52,513 --> 00:15:55,693
Those who choose this
destructive path...

148
00:15:55,793 --> 00:15:57,933
your actions are based on a
misunderstanding...

149
00:15:58,033 --> 00:16:02,174
of how we have survived.
Together.

150
00:16:02,274 --> 00:16:04,974
It is a contract.

151
00:16:05,074 --> 00:16:10,214
Each district supplies the Capitol.
Like blood to a heart.

152
00:16:10,314 --> 00:16:15,655
In return, the Capitol provides
order and security.

153
00:16:15,755 --> 00:16:18,455
To refuse work...

154
00:16:18,555 --> 00:16:21,855
is to put the entire system
in danger.

155
00:16:21,955 --> 00:16:25,615
The Capitol is the beating
heart of Panem.

156
00:16:25,715 --> 00:16:27,616
Nothing can survive without
a heart.

157
00:16:29,716 --> 00:16:31,356
The criminals that kneel
before you...

158
00:16:32,836 --> 00:16:36,056
use symbols for the purpose
of sedition.

159
00:16:36,156 --> 00:16:37,836
Which is why all images...

160
00:16:37,876 --> 00:16:39,457
of The Mockingjay...

161
00:16:39,557 --> 00:16:40,637
are now forbidden.

162
00:16:42,517 --> 00:16:44,977
Possessing them will be
considered treason.

163
00:16:45,077 --> 00:16:46,757
Punishable by death.

164
00:16:48,437 --> 00:16:50,517
Justice shall be served swiftly.

165
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:54,898
Order shall be restored.

166
00:16:54,998 --> 00:16:57,478
To those who ignore the warnings
of history...

167
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:07,839
prepare to pay the ultimate
price.

168
00:17:50,882 --> 00:17:52,623
It's okay.

169
00:17:52,723 --> 00:17:54,543
We're okay.

170
00:17:54,643 --> 00:17:56,423
We're all here now.

171
00:17:56,523 --> 00:17:57,483
Buttercup!

172
00:17:59,443 --> 00:18:00,763
I smuggled him in.

173
00:18:04,764 --> 00:18:06,044
I got Dad.

174
00:18:09,844 --> 00:18:11,844
And I got some of your herbs,
from the kitchen.

175
00:18:13,724 --> 00:18:15,944
They have strict rules.

176
00:18:16,044 --> 00:18:18,045
I don't know what they'll do
if they find him here.

177
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:33,886
You should try to eat something.

178
00:18:47,487 --> 00:18:49,467
Hello.
Good evening.

179
00:18:49,567 --> 00:18:52,467
And a big welcome to all
in Panem.

180
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:54,228
I'm Caesar Flickerman.

181
00:18:54,328 --> 00:18:56,908
And whoever you are, whatever
it is you're doing...

182
00:18:57,008 --> 00:18:58,388
if you're working, put down
your work.

183
00:18:58,488 --> 00:19:00,308
If you're having dinner, stop
having dinner.

184
00:19:00,408 --> 00:19:04,628
Because you are going to want
to witness this, tonight.

185
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:06,549
There has been rampant
speculation...

186
00:19:06,649 --> 00:19:10,149
about what really happened
in the Quarter Quell.

187
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:11,709
And here to shed a little
light...

188
00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:14,389
on the subject for us is a
very special guest.

189
00:19:14,489 --> 00:19:17,730
Please welcome Mr. Peeta Mellark.

190
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,050
Peeta, a lot of people...

191
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:24,090
feel as though they are in
the dark.

192
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,150
Yeah, I know how they feel.

193
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,430
Now, to set the stage for us.

194
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:31,511
Talk us through what really
happened...

195
00:19:31,611 --> 00:19:33,871
on that final and controversial
night.

196
00:19:33,971 --> 00:19:36,191
Well, first off, you have to
understand...

197
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:39,151
that when you're in the Games...

198
00:19:39,251 --> 00:19:41,071
you only get one wish.
It's very costly.

199
00:19:41,171 --> 00:19:42,172
You're alive.

200
00:19:42,212 --> 00:19:43,432
It costs your life.

201
00:19:43,532 --> 00:19:45,372
I think it costs more than
your life.

202
00:19:45,412 --> 00:19:46,752
How do you mean?
What's more than your life?

203
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,892
I mean to murder innocent
people...

204
00:19:48,932 --> 00:19:50,832
that costs everything that
you are.

205
00:19:50,932 --> 00:19:52,112
Yes.

206
00:19:52,212 --> 00:19:55,933
So, you hold on to that one
wish.

207
00:19:55,973 --> 00:19:58,313
And that night my wish was to
save Katniss.

208
00:19:58,413 --> 00:19:59,713
Yes.

209
00:19:59,813 --> 00:20:01,533
I should've just run off
with her...

210
00:20:01,573 --> 00:20:02,433
earlier in the day, like she'd
wanted.

211
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:04,313
But you didn't.
No.

212
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:07,874
Why? Were you caught up in
Beetee's plan?

213
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:10,114
No, I was caught up trying
to play allies.

214
00:20:11,214 --> 00:20:12,774
And then they separated us...

215
00:20:15,134 --> 00:20:16,134
and that's when I lost her.

216
00:20:18,054 --> 00:20:19,995
And then the lightning hit...

217
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:23,515
and the whole force field around
the arena just blew out.

218
00:20:23,615 --> 00:20:24,835
Yes, but Peeta...

219
00:20:24,935 --> 00:20:28,075
Katniss is the one who blew
it out.

220
00:20:28,175 --> 00:20:29,035
No.

221
00:20:29,135 --> 00:20:30,435
You saw the footage.

222
00:20:30,535 --> 00:20:32,436
No, she didn't know what she
was doing.

223
00:20:32,536 --> 00:20:34,196
Neither of us knew...

224
00:20:34,296 --> 00:20:36,116
there was a bigger plan going
on. We had no idea.

225
00:20:36,216 --> 00:20:38,276
You had no idea?
No.

226
00:20:38,376 --> 00:20:40,556
All right. Well, Peeta, there are
many who find this suspicious...

227
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,556
to say the least.
Mmm-hmm.

228
00:20:42,656 --> 00:20:46,277
It seems as though she was
part of a rebel plan.

229
00:20:46,377 --> 00:20:47,677
Do you think it was part of
her plan...

230
00:20:47,777 --> 00:20:50,117
to be almost killed by Johanna?

231
00:20:50,217 --> 00:20:52,557
Or part of the plan to be
paralyzed by lightning?

232
00:20:52,657 --> 00:20:54,597
No, we were not part of any
rebel plan.

233
00:20:54,697 --> 00:20:56,918
We had no idea what was going on.

234
00:20:57,018 --> 00:21:00,238
All right. I believe you, Peeta
Mellark. Thank you.

235
00:21:00,338 --> 00:21:02,238
Yeah.

236
00:21:02,338 --> 00:21:03,838
And I was going to ask you to
speak about the unrest...

237
00:21:03,938 --> 00:21:05,958
but I think you might be
too upset.

238
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:07,558
No, I can.

239
00:21:07,658 --> 00:21:09,319
Are you sure?
Yeah, absolutely.

240
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:10,379
Thank you.

241
00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:18,559
I want everyone who's watching
to stop...

242
00:21:18,659 --> 00:21:21,800
and to think about what a civil
war could mean.

243
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,160
We almost went extinct once
before.

244
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,720
And now our numbers are even
fewer.

245
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,000
He's one of them.

246
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,000
Is this really what we wanna do?

247
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,000
He's a traitor.

248
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,480
Kill ourselves off?

249
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,521
Killing is not the answer.

250
00:21:32,621 --> 00:21:34,521
I can't believe he's doing this.

251
00:21:34,621 --> 00:21:36,641
Everyone needs to lay down
their weapons, immediately.

252
00:21:36,741 --> 00:21:37,681
Traitor!

253
00:21:37,781 --> 00:21:39,481
He's not one of us!

254
00:21:39,581 --> 00:21:41,561
This is treason!

255
00:21:41,661 --> 00:21:43,361
Are you calling for a ceasefire?

256
00:21:44,462 --> 00:21:46,202
Yeah.
I am.

257
00:21:46,302 --> 00:21:47,322
You're a puppet!

258
00:21:47,422 --> 00:21:48,722
Hang him!

259
00:21:48,822 --> 00:21:49,922
I want everyone to stop...

260
00:21:50,022 --> 00:21:52,082
the senseless violence.

261
00:21:52,182 --> 00:21:53,762
This is not the path to change.

262
00:21:53,862 --> 00:21:55,042
Traitor!

263
00:21:55,142 --> 00:21:57,903
It's not the path to justice.

264
00:22:20,024 --> 00:22:21,985
There can't be a ceasefire.

265
00:22:23,865 --> 00:22:25,705
Not after everything Snow's done.

266
00:22:27,305 --> 00:22:29,405
He could have done a lot of
damage, tonight.

267
00:22:29,505 --> 00:22:31,325
Most districts, people are still
too afraid to join.

268
00:22:31,425 --> 00:22:32,885
They need the courage.

269
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:34,026
Why do you think he said that?

270
00:22:36,826 --> 00:22:38,226
I don't know.
Maybe he was forced.

271
00:22:43,506 --> 00:22:45,026
He didn't look that bad.

272
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:49,747
Maybe he made some kind of deal
to protect you.

273
00:22:52,787 --> 00:22:54,587
He's still playing the game.

274
00:23:02,868 --> 00:23:05,708
No! No! No!

275
00:23:10,909 --> 00:23:14,009
I'm sorry.
It's just a nightmare.

276
00:23:14,109 --> 00:23:15,509
That's okay.
I get 'em, too.

277
00:23:20,029 --> 00:23:20,989
Peeta...

278
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,150
will you stay with me?

279
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,150
Yeah.

280
00:23:38,231 --> 00:23:39,191
Always.

281
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:47,432
Hey.

282
00:23:48,952 --> 00:23:50,232
Can't sleep?

283
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:09,553
Tell me what's happening.

284
00:24:11,354 --> 00:24:12,714
I'm good at keeping secrets.

285
00:24:13,954 --> 00:24:14,914
Even from Mom.

286
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:22,834
No one hates the Capitol
more than me.

287
00:24:25,355 --> 00:24:28,275
And I wanna help.
But I just keep thinking...

288
00:24:30,075 --> 00:24:32,555
even if we win this war, what
happens to Peeta?

289
00:24:34,235 --> 00:24:35,696
I know he's not safe there...

290
00:24:35,796 --> 00:24:37,776
but he's definitely not
safe here.

291
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:38,896
I don't think you know...

292
00:24:38,996 --> 00:24:41,716
how important you are to them.

293
00:24:41,756 --> 00:24:44,636
If you want something, you just
have to ask.

294
00:24:46,556 --> 00:24:49,137
You could demand almost anything.

295
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:51,697
They'd have to agree to it.

296
00:24:51,797 --> 00:24:54,157
I should wake you up more often,
Little Duck.

297
00:24:56,477 --> 00:24:58,037
Get some sleep, now.

298
00:24:59,437 --> 00:25:00,438
You too.

299
00:25:07,638 --> 00:25:09,818
Thank you for agreeing to meet
with me.

300
00:25:09,918 --> 00:25:12,579
I've decided I'll be your
Mockingjay.

301
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:15,319
But I have some conditions.

302
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:23,319
Peeta and the other Tributes...

303
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:25,660
Johanna Mason and Annie Cresta...

304
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,060
will be rescued at the earliest
opportunity.

305
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,460
If and when Peeta is liberated...

306
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,780
he will receive a full and
unconditional pardon.

307
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,900
No punishment will be inflicted.

308
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,721
And the same goes for the other
Tributes.

309
00:25:41,001 --> 00:25:43,321
No.

310
00:25:43,361 --> 00:25:45,941
It's not their fault you abandoned
them in the arena.

311
00:25:46,041 --> 00:25:48,121
They're doing and saying whatever
they can to survive.

312
00:25:48,161 --> 00:25:50,782
Individuals don't make demands
in 13.

313
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:53,242
There will be a tribunal.
And a fair judgment.

314
00:25:54,202 --> 00:25:55,402
Thank you.

315
00:25:56,962 --> 00:25:58,662
The Victors will be granted
immunity...

316
00:25:58,762 --> 00:26:00,142
and you will announce that...

317
00:26:00,242 --> 00:26:02,463
in front of the entire population
of 13.

318
00:26:02,563 --> 00:26:04,943
You will hold yourself and your
government responsible...

319
00:26:05,043 --> 00:26:07,303
or, you will find another
Mockingjay.

320
00:26:07,403 --> 00:26:10,423
That's it.
That's her, right there.

321
00:26:10,523 --> 00:26:12,263
Isn't that who I promised you?

322
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:14,504
She wears the costume...

323
00:26:14,604 --> 00:26:16,784
gunfire in the background.
A hint of smoke.

324
00:26:16,884 --> 00:26:18,164
Our Mockingjay.

325
00:26:19,764 --> 00:26:21,544
Madam President, we're losing
ground...

326
00:26:21,644 --> 00:26:23,264
because the people are losing
heart.

327
00:26:23,364 --> 00:26:24,464
This is worth the risk.

328
00:26:24,564 --> 00:26:26,185
She's worth the risk.

329
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:28,665
Pardons, tribunals.
Power of the people.

330
00:26:28,765 --> 00:26:32,185
It can all be the bedrock of
the new Panem, but...

331
00:26:32,285 --> 00:26:34,305
in wartime I think even the
noblest of causes...

332
00:26:34,405 --> 00:26:36,245
can be bent a little bit.
Right?

333
00:26:41,126 --> 00:26:43,006
Do you have any other conditions?

334
00:26:48,646 --> 00:26:50,994
My sister gets to keep her cat.

335
00:27:05,128 --> 00:27:06,088
Go away.

336
00:27:11,048 --> 00:27:12,728
Is it visiting hours, again?

337
00:27:14,529 --> 00:27:15,609
Miss Trinket...

338
00:27:17,409 --> 00:27:19,429
you see this door?

339
00:27:19,529 --> 00:27:22,309
It opens... from the inside.

340
00:27:22,409 --> 00:27:24,604
I've told you, these are the
standard living quarters.

341
00:27:24,704 --> 00:27:25,989
Same as everyone.

342
00:27:26,089 --> 00:27:29,266
You're not a prisoner. You're
free to join the rest of 13.

343
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:33,710
Not looking like this.
Thank you very much.

344
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:36,770
We have a bigger issue than
wardrobe, Miss Trinket.

345
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:38,470
Katniss has agreed to be "The
Mockingjay."

346
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:39,811
Oh, that poor thing.

347
00:27:39,851 --> 00:27:42,511
And your "Girl on Fire" is
burnt out.

348
00:27:42,611 --> 00:27:44,411
I need you to join this
team, now.

349
00:27:45,371 --> 00:27:46,911
I need someone she trusts.

350
00:27:47,011 --> 00:27:48,671
What about Haymitch?

351
00:27:48,771 --> 00:27:51,232
He's drying out in some facility,
a mile down.

352
00:27:51,332 --> 00:27:55,012
Aiding rebels is not really
my forte.

353
00:27:55,052 --> 00:27:59,432
Miss Trinket, your days in the
Capitol are over...

354
00:27:59,532 --> 00:28:00,732
no matter what happens here.

355
00:28:02,252 --> 00:28:05,033
If you wanna play a prisoner
of war, fine.

356
00:28:05,133 --> 00:28:07,012
Stay here and rot.

357
00:28:07,112 --> 00:28:09,718
I'll find someone else to be
The Mockingjay's escort.

358
00:28:10,053 --> 00:28:11,053
Who?

359
00:28:13,773 --> 00:28:17,254
Anyone... can be replaced.

360
00:28:18,854 --> 00:28:20,054
Not your Mockingjay.

361
00:28:22,574 --> 00:28:24,274
There isn't a soul in this
dungeon...

362
00:28:24,374 --> 00:28:25,734
who knows the first thing
about Katniss.

363
00:28:28,495 --> 00:28:30,955
You honestly believe one of
these cave dwellers...

364
00:28:31,055 --> 00:28:32,855
is going to take my place?

365
00:28:33,935 --> 00:28:34,935
No.

366
00:28:50,416 --> 00:28:52,437
Good afternoon.

367
00:28:52,537 --> 00:28:55,557
Thank you for interrupting
your schedules.

368
00:28:55,657 --> 00:28:58,717
They have already been adjusted
to compensate for the delay.

369
00:28:58,817 --> 00:29:00,917
I hardly ever see children
around here.

370
00:29:01,017 --> 00:29:02,757
Please, check in with your unit
supervisors when you resume work.

371
00:29:02,857 --> 00:29:05,478
A lot of them were lost in an
epidemic a few years ago.

372
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:08,398
I have an announcement for the...
Coin lost her family, too.

373
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:09,918
citizens of 13...
Daughter and a husband.

374
00:29:10,018 --> 00:29:12,638
and our welcome guests from 12.

375
00:29:12,738 --> 00:29:14,718
Katniss Everdeen has consented...

376
00:29:14,818 --> 00:29:17,239
to be the face of our cause...

377
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:20,879
to help unite the districts
against the Capitol.

378
00:29:20,979 --> 00:29:23,819
In exchange, I have promised...

379
00:29:23,859 --> 00:29:26,759
several concessions.

380
00:29:26,859 --> 00:29:29,480
First, we'll assess all
opportunities...

381
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,680
for the extraction of the
Victors...

382
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,700
held hostage in the Capitol.

383
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,980
Peeta Mellark...

384
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,261
Johanna Mason...

385
00:29:41,301 --> 00:29:42,561
Finnick, I made the deal for
Annie, too.

386
00:29:42,661 --> 00:29:44,301
and Annie Cresta.

387
00:29:45,421 --> 00:29:47,121
Once freed...

388
00:29:47,221 --> 00:29:49,841
they will be granted full pardon
for any and all crimes...

389
00:29:49,941 --> 00:29:52,261
committed against the rebel
cause.

390
00:29:53,582 --> 00:29:54,922
Good!

391
00:29:55,022 --> 00:29:56,782
That's good, Katniss.

392
00:29:58,982 --> 00:30:02,762
If Katniss Everdeen fails to
fulfill her duties...

393
00:30:02,862 --> 00:30:04,642
the deal will be off.

394
00:30:04,742 --> 00:30:06,963
Thank you for your attention.

395
00:30:07,063 --> 00:30:09,103
Please, resume with your
daily schedules.

396
00:30:12,943 --> 00:30:13,883
Madam President...

397
00:30:13,983 --> 00:30:15,203
Effie Trinket.

398
00:30:15,303 --> 00:30:16,963
Welcome to 13.

399
00:30:17,063 --> 00:30:19,784
Madam President, may I say you
are so very...

400
00:30:20,824 --> 00:30:22,864
concise?
Mmm.

401
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,604
You believe that there's more
to be said?

402
00:30:24,704 --> 00:30:25,904
May I speak freely?

403
00:30:25,944 --> 00:30:28,484
You don't appear to do
anything else.

404
00:30:28,584 --> 00:30:31,925
I'm only talking about
salesmanship.

405
00:30:32,025 --> 00:30:34,965
The thing with revolutions,
they're a tender flame.

406
00:30:35,065 --> 00:30:36,945
They need to be nurtured with
a little kindling...

407
00:30:36,985 --> 00:30:39,665
and warmth.

408
00:30:39,705 --> 00:30:40,605
Bit of oxygen.

409
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:42,806
Oxygen.

410
00:30:42,906 --> 00:30:45,006
One sure way to put it out is
to smother it.

411
00:30:45,106 --> 00:30:47,646
Or to use up all the air
in the room.

412
00:30:47,746 --> 00:30:48,826
Excuse me.

413
00:30:51,786 --> 00:30:55,107
You know what could use a
revolution? That hair.

414
00:30:56,507 --> 00:30:57,507
Effie?

415
00:30:58,947 --> 00:30:59,947
Oh!

416
00:31:02,947 --> 00:31:04,687
What are you doing here?

417
00:31:04,787 --> 00:31:06,808
I'm a political refugee.

418
00:31:06,908 --> 00:31:08,468
Plutarch rescued you?

419
00:31:08,508 --> 00:31:10,928
Rescued, yes, that's what he
calls it.

420
00:31:11,028 --> 00:31:13,648
You and I were both in the dark.

421
00:31:13,748 --> 00:31:17,008
Now I'm condemned to this life
of jumpsuits.

422
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:19,189
It is wonderful to see you again.

423
00:31:22,269 --> 00:31:23,389
Can you believe this place?

424
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:26,349
I miss coffee.

425
00:31:27,829 --> 00:31:30,369
I never knew any place could
be so strict.

426
00:31:30,469 --> 00:31:32,790
I mean, I thought at least...

427
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,430
in the higher ranks there'd
be some...

428
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:37,250
side action.

429
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,350
I miss my wigs.

430
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:41,250
Luckily, I remembered that this
was all the rage...

431
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:43,090
when I was coming up.

432
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:45,591
You know, everything old can
be made new again.

433
00:31:47,031 --> 00:31:48,271
Like democracy.

434
00:31:50,071 --> 00:31:52,031
Which brings me to this.

435
00:32:00,672 --> 00:32:01,792
Cinna.

436
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,632
He's dead, isn't he?

437
00:32:09,233 --> 00:32:10,393
Yes, dear.

438
00:32:14,713 --> 00:32:17,133
He made Plutarch promise not
to show you this...

439
00:32:17,233 --> 00:32:19,833
until you'd decided to be
The Mockingjay on your own.

440
00:32:21,514 --> 00:32:24,354
He knew the risks.
As we all do.

441
00:32:26,874 --> 00:32:29,194
He believed in this revolution.

442
00:32:31,114 --> 00:32:32,415
He believed in you.

443
00:32:32,515 --> 00:32:34,035
They're beautiful.

444
00:32:36,355 --> 00:32:38,215
They have it.

445
00:32:38,315 --> 00:32:40,115
They have the Mockingjay outfit.

446
00:32:42,515 --> 00:32:44,696
There's not much of a prep team
here in 13...

447
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,396
but we will make you...

448
00:32:47,956 --> 00:32:50,356
the best-dressed rebel in history.

449
00:32:54,316 --> 00:32:55,556
Okay.

450
00:32:56,997 --> 00:32:58,277
Bring up the lights.

451
00:33:15,638 --> 00:33:16,798
Cinna's final touch.

452
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:24,379
Everyone's either gonna wanna
kiss you, kill you...

453
00:33:24,479 --> 00:33:26,819
or be you.

454
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:27,999
Perfect.

455
00:33:28,959 --> 00:33:30,459
Absolutely perfect.

456
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,759
Okay.
Let's bring up the setting.

457
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,960
Huh.

458
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,160
Little wind.

459
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,900
Okay, Katniss...

460
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,140
we're gonna start you down
on one knee.

461
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,361
Okay.
And as you rise up...

462
00:33:47,401 --> 00:33:50,301
you're gonna hold your flag in
the air and deliver your line.

463
00:33:50,401 --> 00:33:52,501
And remember...

464
00:33:52,601 --> 00:33:54,141
you've just stormed the
outskirts of the Capitol...

465
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:55,981
arm-in-arm with your brothers
and sisters.

466
00:33:56,081 --> 00:33:57,041
Okay.

467
00:33:58,402 --> 00:34:00,762
Whenever you're ready.

468
00:34:03,722 --> 00:34:06,602
People of Panem, we fight,
we dare, we...

469
00:34:09,362 --> 00:34:10,903
Does she know the line?

470
00:34:11,003 --> 00:34:12,323
I know it. I got it. I'm sorry.
Okay, All right.

471
00:34:12,363 --> 00:34:13,943
Let's do it again.
She's warming up.

472
00:34:14,043 --> 00:34:17,283
All right. With energy.
Go.

473
00:34:17,323 --> 00:34:19,103
People of Panem, we fight!

474
00:34:19,203 --> 00:34:23,364
We dare to end this hunger
for justice!

475
00:34:23,404 --> 00:34:25,464
You've just been in battle!

476
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:28,324
I'm sorry.
Excuse my outburst.

477
00:34:28,364 --> 00:34:30,404
You've just been in battle.

478
00:34:31,364 --> 00:34:32,944
Let's try it again.

479
00:34:33,044 --> 00:34:34,004
Whenever you're ready.

480
00:34:35,285 --> 00:34:37,305
People of Panem, we fight!

481
00:34:37,405 --> 00:34:41,965
We dare to end this hunger
for justice.

482
00:34:52,446 --> 00:34:55,566
And that, my friends, is how
a revolution dies.

483
00:34:59,567 --> 00:35:01,047
Hello, Katniss.

484
00:35:04,647 --> 00:35:06,047
This how you greet an old friend?

485
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,607
Maybe I don't recognize
you sober.

486
00:35:10,927 --> 00:35:13,448
I guess it looks as bad as
it feels.

487
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:18,268
People of Panem, we fight!

488
00:35:18,368 --> 00:35:21,968
We dare!
We end this hunger for justice!

489
00:35:32,129 --> 00:35:34,469
Uh, Madam President...

490
00:35:34,569 --> 00:35:37,110
indulge me for a moment, if
you would.

491
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:39,390
Let's everybody think of one
incident...

492
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:42,590
where Katniss Everdeen genuinely
moved you.

493
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:44,990
Not where you were jealous of
her hairstyle...

494
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:47,671
or her dress went up in flames...

495
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:50,671
or she made a half-way decent
shot with an arrow.

496
00:35:50,771 --> 00:35:54,031
And not where Peeta made you
like her.

497
00:35:54,131 --> 00:35:56,811
No, I'd like you all to think
of one moment...

498
00:35:56,851 --> 00:35:59,531
where she made you feel
something real.

499
00:36:01,612 --> 00:36:04,632
When she volunteered for her
sister, at the Reaping.

500
00:36:04,732 --> 00:36:06,292
Excellent example.

501
00:36:07,252 --> 00:36:09,032
Okay.

502
00:36:09,132 --> 00:36:11,052
I hope that wasn't important.

503
00:36:11,092 --> 00:36:15,873
Uh... okay.
"Volunteer for sister."

504
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:17,673
Good.
What else?

505
00:36:17,773 --> 00:36:21,033
Oh, when she sang that song
for little Rue?

506
00:36:21,133 --> 00:36:24,354
Oh, yeah.
Who didn't get choked up at that?

507
00:36:24,454 --> 00:36:26,794
You know, I like you better,
Effie, without all that makeup.

508
00:36:26,894 --> 00:36:28,534
Well, I like you better sober.

509
00:36:29,814 --> 00:36:32,174
When she chose Rue as an ally,
as well.

510
00:36:32,214 --> 00:36:33,934
Mmm, yes.

511
00:36:33,974 --> 00:36:36,274
Now, what do all these have
in common?

512
00:36:36,374 --> 00:36:37,735
No one told her what to do.

513
00:36:38,695 --> 00:36:40,875
Unscripted, yes.

514
00:36:40,975 --> 00:36:42,115
So, maybe we should just leave
her alone.

515
00:36:42,215 --> 00:36:44,555
And wash her face.

516
00:36:44,655 --> 00:36:46,795
She's still a girl.
You made her look thirty-five.

517
00:36:46,895 --> 00:36:49,596
The opportunities for spontaneity...

518
00:36:49,696 --> 00:36:51,696
are obviously lacking below
ground.

519
00:36:51,736 --> 00:36:56,316
So, what you're suggesting is,
we toss her into combat?

520
00:36:56,416 --> 00:36:58,116
I can't sanction putting an
untrained civilian...

521
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,276
in battle just for effect.

522
00:37:00,376 --> 00:37:02,257
This is not the Capitol.

523
00:37:02,297 --> 00:37:04,597
That is exactly what I'm suggesting.
Put her in the field.

524
00:37:04,697 --> 00:37:05,837
No, we can't protect her.

525
00:37:05,937 --> 00:37:07,437
It has to come from her.

526
00:37:07,537 --> 00:37:09,457
That's what people respond to.

527
00:37:09,497 --> 00:37:12,197
You want a symbol for the
revolution?

528
00:37:12,297 --> 00:37:14,678
She cannot be coached into it.
Trust me, I know.

529
00:37:14,778 --> 00:37:16,658
Maybe there's someplace that's
less dangerous.

530
00:37:16,698 --> 00:37:18,558
District 8. They reported
heavy bombing, last week.

531
00:37:18,658 --> 00:37:20,338
There are no military targets
left.

532
00:37:20,378 --> 00:37:21,478
We can't guarantee her safety.

533
00:37:21,578 --> 00:37:23,498
You'll never be able to guarantee
my safety.

534
00:37:25,058 --> 00:37:26,259
I wanna go.

535
00:37:26,299 --> 00:37:27,659
And if you're killed?

536
00:37:29,299 --> 00:37:30,779
Make sure you get it on camera.

537
00:37:34,739 --> 00:37:36,619
I've made you some surprises.

538
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,020
Maybe you wanna try one out.

539
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,380
If you're gonna be a part of
Katniss' propo team...

540
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,860
you may as well look the part.

541
00:38:02,662 --> 00:38:06,022
And this one is for you.

542
00:38:08,582 --> 00:38:10,202
Plutarch wanted you to have
a weapon...

543
00:38:10,302 --> 00:38:12,022
for the sake of the propos...

544
00:38:12,062 --> 00:38:14,823
but I couldn't just make you
a fashion accessory.

545
00:38:17,823 --> 00:38:19,063
It's beautiful.

546
00:38:21,503 --> 00:38:22,983
And look here.

547
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:31,444
Regular. Incendiary.
Explosive arrows.

548
00:38:31,544 --> 00:38:33,324
All color-coded.

549
00:38:33,424 --> 00:38:36,844
And tell Finnick...

550
00:38:36,944 --> 00:38:38,845
I've got a trident for him...

551
00:38:38,945 --> 00:38:39,905
when he's ready.

552
00:38:41,025 --> 00:38:43,185
Might just cheer him... cheer
him up.

553
00:38:44,505 --> 00:38:45,605
Uh...

554
00:38:45,705 --> 00:38:48,865
let's not fire the red ones...
in here.

555
00:39:06,107 --> 00:39:07,767
You had all of this and you
just...

556
00:39:07,867 --> 00:39:09,667
left the districts to fend
for themselves?

557
00:39:11,547 --> 00:39:14,567
It's not that simple, Katniss.
We barely survived.

558
00:39:14,667 --> 00:39:15,708
We weren't in any kind of shape...

559
00:39:15,748 --> 00:39:17,608
to launch a counterattack.

560
00:39:17,708 --> 00:39:18,968
Yeah, we could've bombed the
Capitol...

561
00:39:19,068 --> 00:39:20,128
but they would've retaliated...

562
00:39:20,228 --> 00:39:21,368
with at least twice the firepower.

563
00:39:21,468 --> 00:39:24,188
Then what?

564
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:26,808
There would've been nobody
left to claim victory.

565
00:39:26,908 --> 00:39:28,489
Sounds like exactly what
Peeta said...

566
00:39:28,589 --> 00:39:30,109
and then you all called
him a traitor.

567
00:39:33,069 --> 00:39:34,589
This way, soldier.

568
00:39:35,909 --> 00:39:37,869
You are camera-ready.

569
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:42,270
Doesn't your comrade look
handsome?

570
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,230
Let's go.

571
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:49,990
Come back safe.

572
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:54,571
Quick introductions, Katniss.

573
00:39:54,671 --> 00:39:56,731
These people have come a long
way to support the cause.

574
00:39:56,831 --> 00:39:57,771
This is Cressida.

575
00:39:57,871 --> 00:39:59,391
In my opinion, one of the best...

576
00:39:59,431 --> 00:40:01,131
up-and-coming directors in
the Capitol.

577
00:40:01,231 --> 00:40:03,391
Until I up and left.
Hey.

578
00:40:03,431 --> 00:40:04,672
Hey.

579
00:40:04,712 --> 00:40:05,632
Let's see what you can do.

580
00:40:05,672 --> 00:40:06,672
All right.
Be careful.

581
00:40:08,392 --> 00:40:10,332
This is my assistant, Messalla.

582
00:40:10,432 --> 00:40:11,772
It's an honor to meet you.

583
00:40:11,872 --> 00:40:13,612
And your cameramen over there,
Castor.

584
00:40:13,712 --> 00:40:14,932
Hello.

585
00:40:15,032 --> 00:40:15,992
And Pollux.

586
00:40:18,873 --> 00:40:20,073
Let's get locked in.

587
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:28,193
You're all from the Capitol?

588
00:40:28,233 --> 00:40:29,494
Plutarch got you out?

589
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:31,574
Don't expect much chitchat
from him.

590
00:40:31,674 --> 00:40:35,214
He's an Avox. Capitol cut his
tongue out, years ago.

591
00:40:35,314 --> 00:40:37,854
And, no, it wasn't any sort of
rescue...

592
00:40:37,954 --> 00:40:39,274
if that's what you mean.

593
00:40:40,834 --> 00:40:42,695
We all fled on our own.

594
00:40:42,795 --> 00:40:44,575
For this.

595
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:45,675
For you.

596
00:41:16,357 --> 00:41:18,118
This has gotta be fast.
In and out.

597
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:36,839
Move out.

598
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,760
You're alive, then.
We weren't sure.

599
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,740
Katniss, Commander Paylor,
District 8.

600
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,595
Katniss has been recovering, but
she insisted on coming out...

601
00:41:54,695 --> 00:41:55,421
and seeing some of your wounded.

602
00:41:55,521 --> 00:41:57,579
Well, we've got plenty of those.

603
00:42:07,042 --> 00:42:09,322
We have a mass grave a few
blocks west, but...

604
00:42:09,362 --> 00:42:12,202
I can't spare the manpower
to move them yet.

605
00:42:12,242 --> 00:42:14,062
Hospital's past that curtain.

606
00:42:14,162 --> 00:42:16,582
Any hope you can give them,
it's worth it.

607
00:42:16,682 --> 00:42:19,863
The Capitol's done everything
they can to break us.

608
00:42:19,963 --> 00:42:21,943
Aren't you worried about having
all your wounded in one place?

609
00:42:22,043 --> 00:42:23,403
I think it's better than
leaving them to die.

610
00:42:24,443 --> 00:42:25,663
That's not what I meant.

611
00:42:25,763 --> 00:42:28,063
Well, that's my only other
option.

612
00:42:28,163 --> 00:42:30,283
You can come up with another,
I'm all ears.

613
00:42:31,244 --> 00:42:32,484
It's right through here.

614
00:42:44,725 --> 00:42:47,565
Don't film me in there.
I can't help them.

615
00:42:49,325 --> 00:42:50,765
Just let them see your face.

616
00:42:52,245 --> 00:42:53,205
Huh?

617
00:43:06,646 --> 00:43:07,687
Excuse me.

618
00:43:13,887 --> 00:43:15,167
Yeah.
You all right?

619
00:43:17,167 --> 00:43:18,447
It's okay.
Here, it's okay.

620
00:43:18,487 --> 00:43:20,088
I've got you.
It's all right.

621
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:50,850
Katniss Everdeen?

622
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:56,531
What are you doing here?

623
00:43:58,051 --> 00:43:59,891
I came... I came to see you.

624
00:44:01,771 --> 00:44:03,451
What about the baby?

625
00:44:09,012 --> 00:44:10,292
I lost it.

626
00:44:10,332 --> 00:44:11,492
Are you fighting, Katniss?

627
00:44:14,692 --> 00:44:15,932
You here to fight with us?

628
00:44:17,172 --> 00:44:18,292
I am.

629
00:44:20,052 --> 00:44:21,173
I will.

630
00:44:40,654 --> 00:44:41,774
Tighter.

631
00:44:42,734 --> 00:44:43,734
Tighter, tighter.

632
00:44:52,375 --> 00:44:55,915
Sir, some cameras were damaged
in the bombings...

633
00:44:56,015 --> 00:44:58,976
but we confirmed it's her.

634
00:45:02,296 --> 00:45:03,256
Zoom in.

635
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:12,357
She was visiting a make-shift
hospital.

636
00:45:12,457 --> 00:45:14,377
We're not sure if she's still
there.

637
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:16,297
Hmm.

638
00:45:18,297 --> 00:45:20,517
We can scramble hovercraft
from the border of 11.

639
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:22,258
We may be able to target her.

640
00:45:23,218 --> 00:45:25,018
Hmm.

641
00:45:25,058 --> 00:45:26,198
Kill the wounded.

642
00:45:26,298 --> 00:45:27,418
Sir...

643
00:45:29,138 --> 00:45:31,058
You wrote that speech yourself,
Egeria.

644
00:45:32,538 --> 00:45:35,739
Any association with the
Mockingjay symbol...

645
00:45:35,779 --> 00:45:38,599
is forbidden.

646
00:45:38,699 --> 00:45:41,739
Everyone inside that hospital
has committed treason.

647
00:45:43,739 --> 00:45:46,079
Show them what it costs...

648
00:45:46,179 --> 00:45:48,860
to be friends with Katniss
Everdeen.

649
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,420
Your mom's gonna be proud of you
when she sees the footage.

650
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:52,960
Will this play in the districts?

651
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:55,840
It'll be tattooed on their eyes.

652
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:57,720
There's a problem.

653
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:59,421
What kinda problem?

654
00:45:59,461 --> 00:46:01,521
Incoming bombers from the north.

655
00:46:01,621 --> 00:46:02,801
We need to find cover, now.

656
00:46:02,901 --> 00:46:03,861
There's a bunker in there.

657
00:46:17,342 --> 00:46:18,782
Straight ahead and down
the stairs.

658
00:46:20,702 --> 00:46:22,026
Katniss!

659
00:46:22,242 --> 00:46:23,302
Katniss?

660
00:46:24,663 --> 00:46:28,643
Everdeen!
Everdeen!

661
00:46:28,743 --> 00:46:30,143
Gale, back away from the wall!

662
00:46:45,624 --> 00:46:46,624
You okay?

663
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:54,145
Move!

664
00:47:01,426 --> 00:47:03,086
They're going after something
to the south.

665
00:47:03,186 --> 00:47:04,226
That's towards the hospital.

666
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:11,426
They're circling back around.
Come on!

667
00:47:48,429 --> 00:47:49,850
That's the hospital.

668
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,070
They're targeting the hospital.

669
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,574
Help them!

670
00:48:45,674 --> 00:48:46,994
Help them!
Get them out!

671
00:48:49,674 --> 00:48:51,815
Katniss?

672
00:48:51,915 --> 00:48:53,195
Katniss, can you tell everyone...

673
00:48:53,235 --> 00:48:54,475
what you're seeing right now?

674
00:48:57,675 --> 00:48:59,515
Katniss, what do you wanna say?

675
00:49:09,876 --> 00:49:11,876
I want the rebels to know
that I'm alive.

676
00:49:12,996 --> 00:49:15,097
That I'm in District 8...

677
00:49:15,197 --> 00:49:18,337
where the Capitol just bombed
a hospital...

678
00:49:18,437 --> 00:49:23,017
filled with unarmed men, women
and children.

679
00:49:23,117 --> 00:49:24,437
And there will be no survivors.

680
00:49:26,958 --> 00:49:29,018
If you think for one second...

681
00:49:29,118 --> 00:49:31,698
that the Capitol will ever
treat us fairly...

682
00:49:31,798 --> 00:49:33,998
you are lying to yourselves.

683
00:49:34,038 --> 00:49:35,658
Because we know who they are...

684
00:49:35,758 --> 00:49:36,938
and what they do.

685
00:49:37,038 --> 00:49:41,119
This is what they do!
And we must fight back.

686
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:49,179
I have a message for
President Snow.

687
00:49:49,279 --> 00:49:51,780
You can torture us, and
bomb us...

688
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,840
and burn our districts to
the ground.

689
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,800
But, do you see that?

690
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,600
Fire is catching.

691
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,641
And if we burn, you burn
with us!

692
00:50:24,922 --> 00:50:27,543
We know who they are and what
they do.

693
00:50:27,643 --> 00:50:30,343
This is what they do!

694
00:50:30,443 --> 00:50:31,643
And we must fight back.

695
00:50:33,443 --> 00:50:37,023
You can torture us, and
bomb us...

696
00:50:37,123 --> 00:50:39,343
and burn our districts to
the ground.

697
00:50:39,443 --> 00:50:41,204
Plutarch's faith in you wasn't
misplaced.

698
00:50:41,244 --> 00:50:42,644
But, do you see that?

699
00:50:42,684 --> 00:50:43,744
Thank you.

700
00:50:43,844 --> 00:50:45,044
Fire is catching.

701
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:46,664
Come up with me for the beginning.

702
00:50:46,764 --> 00:50:49,924
And if we burn, you burn
with us!

703
00:51:17,327 --> 00:51:20,047
There is no progress without
compromise.

704
00:51:21,167 --> 00:51:23,447
No victory without sacrifice.

705
00:51:24,847 --> 00:51:27,987
But I stand here with The
Mockingjay...

706
00:51:28,087 --> 00:51:31,528
to announce that our moment
has arrived.

707
00:51:56,170 --> 00:51:57,630
Beetee has increased...

708
00:51:57,730 --> 00:51:59,810
our use of the airwaves tenfold.

709
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:02,710
We will broadcast this message...

710
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:05,070
to all the districts, tonight.

711
00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:07,071
The Mockingjay's words...

712
00:52:07,171 --> 00:52:10,791
inspiring everyone to join
the rebellion.

713
00:52:10,891 --> 00:52:12,031
Together...

714
00:52:12,131 --> 00:52:14,311
we will become...

715
00:52:14,411 --> 00:52:16,411
an alliance to be reckoned with.

716
00:52:18,612 --> 00:52:22,412
Hoorah!
Hoorah!

717
00:52:25,692 --> 00:52:27,772
You don't like hearing a fight
song at a funeral, huh?

718
00:52:30,173 --> 00:52:31,393
The more people on our side...

719
00:52:31,493 --> 00:52:33,093
the closer we are to Peeta
and Annie.

720
00:52:36,093 --> 00:52:37,413
Yeah.

721
00:52:56,695 --> 00:52:58,655
By order of President Snow...

722
00:52:58,695 --> 00:53:02,155
daily production quotas have
been increased.

723
00:53:02,255 --> 00:53:06,075
All work shifts will be extended
by an extra two hours.

724
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:08,856
Failure to meet these quotas
will not be tolerated.

725
00:53:10,136 --> 00:53:12,096
By order of President Snow...

726
00:53:12,136 --> 00:53:14,816
daily production quotas have
been increased.

727
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:01,740
If we burn, you burn with us!

728
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:06,560
Yeah!

729
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,101
Whoo!

730
00:54:08,141 --> 00:54:09,501
Yeah!

731
00:54:29,782 --> 00:54:31,682
I got good news.
What?

732
00:54:31,782 --> 00:54:33,183
Coin agreed to let us hunt
above ground.

733
00:55:23,187 --> 00:55:25,027
He's not even afraid of us.

734
00:55:27,467 --> 00:55:29,027
They've never been hunted
before.

735
00:55:31,547 --> 00:55:32,947
It's almost not fair.

736
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:43,993
They want us back.

737
00:56:58,674 --> 00:57:00,055
They asked us to head for
Command.

738
00:57:00,155 --> 00:57:02,035
All right.
I gotta drop these off.

739
00:57:07,115 --> 00:57:09,855
She was arguably...

740
00:57:09,955 --> 00:57:12,016
our favorite Tribute.

741
00:57:12,116 --> 00:57:16,176
And I think that's what we all
find most astonishing...

742
00:57:16,276 --> 00:57:20,476
is that this girl was adored
in the Capitol.

743
00:57:21,516 --> 00:57:23,137
And I think for you, Peeta...

744
00:57:23,237 --> 00:57:26,657
it must be particularly painful.

745
00:57:26,757 --> 00:57:28,817
I wish I could give this rose
to you, Katniss.

746
00:57:28,917 --> 00:57:29,897
He's changed so much already.

747
00:57:29,997 --> 00:57:31,697
What are they doing to him?

748
00:57:31,797 --> 00:57:33,777
A sweet gesture for a girl
who has inspired...

749
00:57:33,877 --> 00:57:36,338
such violence.

750
00:57:36,438 --> 00:57:37,578
You must love her very much
to be able to forgive her.

751
00:57:37,678 --> 00:57:38,578
He's shaking.

752
00:57:38,678 --> 00:57:40,698
I don't think that I could.

753
00:57:40,798 --> 00:57:43,418
Unless, of course, Peeta, you
think that perhaps she's being...

754
00:57:43,518 --> 00:57:46,038
forced into saying...

755
00:57:46,078 --> 00:57:48,119
things that she doesn't even
understand.

756
00:57:50,239 --> 00:57:52,659
Yeah.
That's exactly what I think.

757
00:57:52,759 --> 00:57:53,939
Even his voice is different.

758
00:57:54,039 --> 00:57:54,979
I think they're using her...

759
00:57:55,079 --> 00:57:56,779
to whip up the rebels.

760
00:57:56,879 --> 00:57:58,819
I doubt she even knows what's
happening.

761
00:57:58,919 --> 00:58:00,660
And what's really at stake.

762
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:01,940
Now, Peeta, I doubt that
the rebels...

763
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,100
will ever let her see this.

764
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,580
But if they do, what would you
say to her?

765
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:08,141
To Katniss Everdeen...

766
00:58:08,241 --> 00:58:10,759
the once sweet Katniss Everdeen,
what will you say?

767
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,461
I would tell her to think
for herself.

768
00:58:13,561 --> 00:58:15,121
Yes.

769
00:58:18,121 --> 00:58:19,861
Don't be a fool, Katniss.

770
00:58:19,961 --> 00:58:23,341
I know you never wanted the
rebellion.

771
00:58:23,441 --> 00:58:24,822
The things that you did in
the Games...

772
00:58:24,922 --> 00:58:29,502
were never intended to start
all of this.

773
00:58:29,602 --> 00:58:30,502
The rebels have made you
into something...

774
00:58:30,602 --> 00:58:32,062
that you're not.

775
00:58:32,162 --> 00:58:34,222
Something that could destroy
all of us.

776
00:58:34,322 --> 00:58:37,903
So, if you have any power, or
any say...

777
00:58:38,003 --> 00:58:40,043
in what they do, or how they
use you...

778
00:58:41,923 --> 00:58:45,023
please, please, urge them to
stop this war...

779
00:58:45,123 --> 00:58:47,023
before it's too late.

780
00:58:47,123 --> 00:58:48,904
And ask yourself...

781
00:58:49,004 --> 00:58:51,004
can you trust the people you're
working with?

782
00:58:53,604 --> 00:58:54,844
Do you know what they really
want?

783
00:58:55,804 --> 00:58:57,344
We need to respond.

784
00:58:57,444 --> 00:58:59,224
Thank you, Peeta Mellark, for
these...

785
00:58:59,324 --> 00:59:02,665
revelations about the real
Mockingjay.

786
00:59:02,765 --> 00:59:03,865
Did you see what he looks like?

787
00:59:03,965 --> 00:59:05,305
I saw a coward.

788
00:59:05,405 --> 00:59:07,065
You don't have any idea what
he's going through.

789
00:59:07,165 --> 00:59:10,585
I don't care. I would never
say what he just said.

790
00:59:10,685 --> 00:59:12,945
Not if they tortured me.
Not with a gun to my head.

791
00:59:13,045 --> 00:59:16,186
That is the same Peeta that
defended you at the whipping post.

792
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:18,766
No, it's not. Now he's only
defending himself.

793
00:59:21,086 --> 00:59:22,546
Coin's called a meeting.
We need to respond.

794
00:59:22,646 --> 00:59:25,066
When did "we" become you and
Coin?

795
00:59:25,166 --> 00:59:27,227
Everyone has a choice.

796
00:59:27,327 --> 00:59:29,227
How can he sit there in the
Capitol and defend the people...

797
00:59:29,327 --> 00:59:31,287
who destroyed his home and
murdered his family?

798
00:59:32,247 --> 00:59:33,647
He doesn't know.

799
00:59:34,607 --> 00:59:36,027
How could he?

800
00:59:36,127 --> 00:59:38,368
Nobody's seen what the Capitol
did to 12.

801
00:59:39,488 --> 00:59:40,768
I have to show them.

802
00:59:55,609 --> 00:59:56,909
So, I wanna start with you...

803
00:59:57,009 --> 00:59:58,609
in front of the Justice Building,
okay?

804
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:04,410
Bang.
First shot.

805
01:00:16,851 --> 01:00:18,251
Katniss, tell us what happened,
here.

806
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:23,691
We were all standin' right
here...

807
01:00:28,452 --> 01:00:30,812
watchin' the Games, when you
fired that arrow.

808
01:00:32,052 --> 01:00:33,152
The screens just went dark.

809
01:00:33,252 --> 01:00:34,212
Nobody had any idea what happened.

810
01:00:37,332 --> 01:00:40,713
Peacekeepers forced us back
into our homes.

811
01:00:40,813 --> 01:00:43,093
For maybe an hour, the town
was just dead quiet.

812
01:00:46,533 --> 01:00:48,813
Little past 9:00, we heard
their trucks pullin' out.

813
01:00:51,574 --> 01:00:53,774
All of them.
Every single Peacekeeper.

814
01:00:56,334 --> 01:00:57,694
And I knew what that meant.

815
01:01:02,174 --> 01:01:03,635
Me and a couple of guys from
the mines...

816
01:01:03,735 --> 01:01:05,235
we started pulling people from
their houses...

817
01:01:05,335 --> 01:01:07,075
and tried to get 'em to the
fence line...

818
01:01:07,175 --> 01:01:08,935
but a lotta people were scared
of the forest.

819
01:01:10,055 --> 01:01:11,915
So, they headed up onto the road.

820
01:01:12,015 --> 01:01:13,535
Make a break for it, that way.

821
01:01:22,976 --> 01:01:24,416
Stay with Gale.

822
01:01:28,897 --> 01:01:31,177
915 of us made it to the fence.

823
01:01:33,177 --> 01:01:37,897
Then we watched as bombers
circled back towards the road.

824
01:01:42,698 --> 01:01:44,698
They firebombed them as they
ran away.

825
01:02:00,939 --> 01:02:03,659
915 outta 10,000.

826
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:11,280
I should've grabbed people.

827
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:12,620
I should've dragged 'em with me.

828
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:16,761
Some of the kids I could've
carried.

829
01:02:16,861 --> 01:02:18,941
You saved so many people, Gale.

830
01:02:20,261 --> 01:02:22,081
Without you, there would be
no District 12.

831
01:02:22,181 --> 01:02:23,861
Not even the memory of it.

832
01:02:55,584 --> 01:02:57,184
This is where you kissed me.

833
01:02:58,304 --> 01:02:59,904
I didn't think you remembered
that.

834
01:03:09,265 --> 01:03:11,425
I'd have to be dead to forget
that.

835
01:03:14,065 --> 01:03:15,385
Maybe not even then.

836
01:03:29,666 --> 01:03:31,027
I knew you'd do that.

837
01:03:32,267 --> 01:03:33,947
How?
I didn't.

838
01:03:34,907 --> 01:03:36,507
'Cause I'm in pain.

839
01:03:40,427 --> 01:03:41,907
That's the only way that I can
get your attention.

840
01:03:47,188 --> 01:03:49,868
Don't worry, Katniss.
It'll pass.

841
01:04:10,150 --> 01:04:11,110
Hey.

842
01:04:20,831 --> 01:04:22,591
Yeah, that's a mockingjay.

843
01:04:37,512 --> 01:04:39,432
Well, now they'll never shut up.

844
01:04:44,793 --> 01:04:45,953
You want me to sing?

845
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:09,660
That line was originally "necklace
of rope."

846
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:12,140
I had it changed to "necklace
of hope."

847
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:15,020
Wow.
You are a true wordsmith.

848
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:17,300
Little on the nose, but, of
course, so is war.

849
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,100
Every district's seeing this?

850
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:20,760
Yes.
But not the Capitol.

851
01:06:22,241 --> 01:06:24,901
I designed this signal defense
system for them.

852
01:06:25,001 --> 01:06:27,381
But I can't find my way
through it.

853
01:06:27,481 --> 01:06:29,821
Guess I did my job too well.

854
01:06:29,921 --> 01:06:32,721
At the time, I was just thinking
of the science of it all.

855
01:06:34,322 --> 01:06:35,849
We'll get through it.

856
01:06:36,536 --> 01:06:40,962
Are you, are you coming to the
tree?

857
01:06:40,963 --> 01:06:45,478
They strung up a man, they say
who murdered three.

858
01:06:45,578 --> 01:06:49,914
Strange things did happen here,
no stranger would it be...

859
01:06:50,014 --> 01:06:54,843
if we met at midnight, in the
hanging tree.

860
01:06:54,943 --> 01:06:59,389
Are you, are you coming to
the tree?

861
01:06:59,489 --> 01:07:04,033
Where dead man called out, for
his love to flee.

862
01:07:04,133 --> 01:07:08,451
Strange things did happen here, no
stranger would it be...

863
01:07:08,551 --> 01:07:13,779
if we met at midnight, in the
hanging tree.

864
01:09:00,244 --> 01:09:06,087
Moves... and countermoves.

865
01:09:27,056 --> 01:09:29,856
Katniss, you're wanted in
Command.

866
01:09:38,057 --> 01:09:40,717
Tonight, we've received reports...

867
01:09:40,817 --> 01:09:42,797
of derailed trains...

868
01:09:42,897 --> 01:09:45,517
of granaries on fire...

869
01:09:45,617 --> 01:09:50,038
and of a savage attack on the
hydro-electric dam in District 5.

870
01:09:50,138 --> 01:09:51,838
Oh, what have they done to you?

871
01:09:51,938 --> 01:09:56,758
I'm begging for restraint and
decency.

872
01:09:56,858 --> 01:09:59,598
We interrupt your regularly
scheduled horse manure...

873
01:09:59,698 --> 01:10:01,019
to bring you...

874
01:10:05,939 --> 01:10:07,079
That's it.
That's our footage.

875
01:10:07,179 --> 01:10:08,619
Beetee's in.

876
01:10:10,579 --> 01:10:11,599
Katniss?

877
01:10:11,699 --> 01:10:13,460
He sees it.
He sees our propo.

878
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:17,920
Katniss, are you there?

879
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:19,600
Peeta.

880
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:21,180
Katniss?

881
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:25,861
Peeta, please continue.

882
01:10:27,461 --> 01:10:30,500
You were telling us about these
savage attacks.

883
01:10:31,261 --> 01:10:32,221
Yeah.

884
01:10:36,541 --> 01:10:40,502
The attack on the dam was
a callous...

885
01:10:42,022 --> 01:10:45,782
and inhuman act of destruction.

886
01:10:52,023 --> 01:10:54,403
Think about it.

887
01:10:54,503 --> 01:10:58,563
How will this end?
What will be left?

888
01:10:58,663 --> 01:11:00,343
No one can survive this.

889
01:11:01,903 --> 01:11:03,164
No one is safe now.

890
01:11:03,264 --> 01:11:04,864
Not here in the Capitol...

891
01:11:06,344 --> 01:11:08,718
not in any of the districts.

892
01:11:12,104 --> 01:11:13,364
They're coming, Katniss.

893
01:11:13,464 --> 01:11:14,725
They're gonna kill everyone.

894
01:11:14,825 --> 01:11:16,465
And in District 13 you'll be
dead by morning!

895
01:11:17,785 --> 01:11:18,865
He's warning us.
That was a warning.

896
01:11:19,825 --> 01:11:21,245
Yes, it was.

897
01:11:21,345 --> 01:11:22,565
We have to get him out before
they kill him.

898
01:11:22,665 --> 01:11:23,525
Is there anything in the air?

899
01:11:23,625 --> 01:11:24,913
Nothing on Doppler, ma'am.

900
01:11:25,013 --> 01:11:26,966
He was in the mansion. He could
have overheard something.

901
01:11:27,066 --> 01:11:28,186
Possibly.

902
01:11:32,706 --> 01:11:33,946
It's time for an air raid
drill.

903
01:11:42,387 --> 01:11:44,167
This is a Code Red alert.

904
01:11:44,267 --> 01:11:45,607
Please, remain calm...

905
01:11:45,707 --> 01:11:47,627
and begin evacuation protocol.

906
01:11:50,267 --> 01:11:52,008
Prim!
Prim!

907
01:11:52,108 --> 01:11:53,168
Proceed to your nearest
stairwell...

908
01:11:53,268 --> 01:11:55,608
and descend to level 40.

909
01:11:55,708 --> 01:11:58,228
Blast doors will be sealed
in six minutes.

910
01:12:00,188 --> 01:12:02,368
This is a Code Red alert.

911
01:12:02,468 --> 01:12:03,849
Please, remain calm...

912
01:12:03,949 --> 01:12:06,409
and begin evacuation protocol.

913
01:12:06,509 --> 01:12:09,209
Proceed in an orderly fashion
to your nearest stairwell...

914
01:12:09,309 --> 01:12:11,369
and descend to level 40.

915
01:12:11,469 --> 01:12:13,049
Madam President...

916
01:12:13,149 --> 01:12:16,210
three Capitol squadrons just
entered our airspace.

917
01:12:16,310 --> 01:12:17,610
How much time do we have?

918
01:12:17,710 --> 01:12:19,190
They're a few seconds from range.

919
01:12:24,430 --> 01:12:25,690
Prepare to scramble the fleet.

920
01:12:25,790 --> 01:12:26,770
Copy that.

921
01:12:26,870 --> 01:12:29,751
Open up short-range air defense.

922
01:12:34,151 --> 01:12:36,171
Arm long-range missiles for
counter-attack.

923
01:12:36,271 --> 01:12:38,391
Blast doors will be sealed
in five minutes.

924
01:12:46,032 --> 01:12:47,652
This is a Code Red alert.

925
01:12:47,752 --> 01:12:49,372
Please, remain calm...

926
01:12:49,472 --> 01:12:51,772
and begin evacuation protocol.

927
01:12:51,872 --> 01:12:53,493
Proceed in an orderly fashion...

928
01:12:53,593 --> 01:12:54,613
to your nearest stairwell...

929
01:12:54,713 --> 01:12:56,733
and descend to level 40.

930
01:12:56,833 --> 01:12:59,993
Blast doors will close in
four minutes.

931
01:13:02,873 --> 01:13:04,734
This is a Code Red alert.

932
01:13:04,834 --> 01:13:06,254
Please, remain calm...

933
01:13:06,354 --> 01:13:08,254
and begin evacuation protocol.

934
01:13:08,354 --> 01:13:10,054
Proceed in an orderly fashion...

935
01:13:10,154 --> 01:13:11,774
to your nearest stairwell...

936
01:13:11,874 --> 01:13:13,694
and descend to level 40.

937
01:13:13,794 --> 01:13:16,875
Blast doors will close in three
minutes.

938
01:13:21,595 --> 01:13:23,455
This is a Code Red alert.

939
01:13:23,555 --> 01:13:25,175
Proceed in an orderly fashion...

940
01:13:25,275 --> 01:13:26,335
to your nearest stairwell...

941
01:13:26,435 --> 01:13:28,475
and descend to level 40.

942
01:13:37,436 --> 01:13:40,376
Continue to the Supply Station
and claim one pack...

943
01:13:40,476 --> 01:13:42,817
for each member of your
compartment.

944
01:13:42,917 --> 01:13:46,897
Please keep all personal items
within your assigned area.

945
01:13:46,997 --> 01:13:49,357
Be courteous to your fellow
citizens.

946
01:13:51,397 --> 01:13:53,698
This is a Code Red alert.

947
01:13:53,798 --> 01:13:56,898
All citizens should be inside
the bunker.

948
01:13:56,998 --> 01:13:58,826
Blast doors will close in...

949
01:13:58,926 --> 01:14:00,936
two minutes.
Mom!

950
01:14:02,638 --> 01:14:03,778
Where's Prim?

951
01:14:03,878 --> 01:14:05,499
I thought she went to find you.

952
01:14:05,599 --> 01:14:06,619
She must still be on the stairs.

953
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:08,239
There's no one on the stairs!

954
01:14:11,079 --> 01:14:13,219
She went back for the cat.

955
01:14:13,319 --> 01:14:15,339
This is a Code Red alert.

956
01:14:15,439 --> 01:14:17,219
All citizens should be inside
the bunker.

957
01:14:17,319 --> 01:14:18,740
Hey, stop!
Stop!

958
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:21,640
Blast doors will close in
one minute.

959
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:29,420
They hit the far edge of the
north-west quadrant.

960
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:30,501
Penetrated 40 feet.

961
01:14:30,601 --> 01:14:31,781
Missed the living quarters.

962
01:14:31,881 --> 01:14:34,021
Only minor damage to corridors
2 and 3.

963
01:14:34,121 --> 01:14:35,101
Is there any radiation?

964
01:14:35,201 --> 01:14:37,061
None detected.

965
01:14:37,161 --> 01:14:39,301
Doppler shows a fourth wave
approaching.

966
01:14:39,401 --> 01:14:41,101
Blast doors will close in
30 seconds.

967
01:14:41,201 --> 01:14:43,002
Prim!

968
01:14:45,282 --> 01:14:46,422
Prim!

969
01:14:46,522 --> 01:14:47,722
Katniss!

970
01:14:53,522 --> 01:14:54,663
This is a Code Red alert.

971
01:14:54,763 --> 01:14:56,223
Katniss!

972
01:14:56,323 --> 01:14:58,383
Blast doors will close in
15 seconds.

973
01:14:58,483 --> 01:14:59,643
Get down here!

974
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:03,143
Hurry!
This is a Code Red alert.

975
01:15:03,243 --> 01:15:06,163
Blast doors will close in
10 seconds.

976
01:15:07,124 --> 01:15:08,164
Nine...

977
01:15:09,204 --> 01:15:10,244
eight...

978
01:15:11,524 --> 01:15:12,484
seven...

979
01:15:13,764 --> 01:15:14,764
six...

980
01:15:16,524 --> 01:15:18,464
five...
Hold the doors!

981
01:15:18,564 --> 01:15:19,725
four...

982
01:15:21,285 --> 01:15:23,625
three...

983
01:15:23,725 --> 01:15:25,165
two...
Wait! Hold the doors!

984
01:15:26,125 --> 01:15:27,245
one.

985
01:15:28,845 --> 01:15:31,026
You went back for the cat?
What were you thinking?

986
01:15:31,126 --> 01:15:32,786
I wasn't gonna leave him behind.

987
01:15:32,886 --> 01:15:34,906
I couldn't live with myself.

988
01:15:35,006 --> 01:15:36,826
Blast doors are now sealed.

989
01:15:36,926 --> 01:15:38,086
I know, Prim.

990
01:15:43,327 --> 01:15:44,527
Let's go.

991
01:15:47,727 --> 01:15:49,387
Damage to the aquifer in the
northwest quadrant.

992
01:15:49,487 --> 01:15:51,147
We lost a transport corridor.

993
01:15:51,247 --> 01:15:52,827
There's nothing else in the
northwest.

994
01:15:52,927 --> 01:15:54,147
Our surface-to-air launchers
just took...

995
01:15:54,247 --> 01:15:55,988
a direct hit in sector 3.

996
01:15:56,088 --> 01:15:57,828
Because we revealed ourselves.

997
01:15:57,928 --> 01:15:59,848
They saw us firing, there.

998
01:16:02,888 --> 01:16:04,628
Stand down.
Don't launch the fleet.

999
01:16:04,728 --> 01:16:06,708
Another 12 Capitol bombers...

1000
01:16:06,808 --> 01:16:09,229
approaching sector 3 in attack
formation.

1001
01:16:09,329 --> 01:16:11,209
Hold fire on their approach.

1002
01:16:13,649 --> 01:16:15,149
Oh.

1003
01:16:15,249 --> 01:16:16,909
What'd they hit?

1004
01:16:17,009 --> 01:16:18,829
Bedrock. But there's debris
in the ventilation shaft.

1005
01:16:18,929 --> 01:16:20,110
They're not targeting our fleet.

1006
01:16:20,210 --> 01:16:22,110
Or our special weaponry.

1007
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:23,950
They don't know what we have,
or where we have it.

1008
01:16:24,050 --> 01:16:25,710
Can you confirm that everyone's
safely in the bunker?

1009
01:16:25,810 --> 01:16:27,790
Already done.

1010
01:16:27,890 --> 01:16:30,430
Conceal all remaining
anti-aircraft guns.

1011
01:16:30,530 --> 01:16:33,111
Seal launching pads and
ventilation corridors.

1012
01:16:33,211 --> 01:16:34,951
We are gonna wait this out.

1013
01:16:35,051 --> 01:16:36,471
This is what we're built for.

1014
01:16:36,571 --> 01:16:38,911
They'll seal us in here like
a tomb.

1015
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:40,431
The Capitol's working off some
outdated information.

1016
01:16:40,531 --> 01:16:42,231
I'd rather not update it
for them.

1017
01:16:42,331 --> 01:16:44,112
Madam President, I know it's
not my place...

1018
01:16:44,212 --> 01:16:45,592
It's not.
You're a welcome guest...

1019
01:16:45,692 --> 01:16:47,672
but you're out of your depth
down here.

1020
01:16:47,772 --> 01:16:50,352
Reduce oxygen to 14% to
conserve it.

1021
01:16:50,452 --> 01:16:52,352
Copy that.

1022
01:16:52,452 --> 01:16:54,312
Take a deep breath, Mr. Heavensbee.

1023
01:16:54,412 --> 01:16:55,572
It's gonna be a long night.

1024
01:17:33,015 --> 01:17:35,216
Prim, talk about something.
Anything.

1025
01:17:38,936 --> 01:17:40,616
They promoted me at the hospital.

1026
01:17:41,696 --> 01:17:43,316
I forgot to tell you.

1027
01:17:43,416 --> 01:17:44,576
They're training me to be
a doctor.

1028
01:17:46,737 --> 01:17:48,417
They'd be stupid not to.

1029
01:18:59,983 --> 01:19:01,023
Hey.

1030
01:19:02,263 --> 01:19:03,363
Can I sit?

1031
01:19:03,463 --> 01:19:04,503
Yeah.

1032
01:19:09,023 --> 01:19:11,644
Snow's using Annie to punish
you.

1033
01:19:11,744 --> 01:19:13,584
He's taunting us with them.

1034
01:19:14,944 --> 01:19:16,924
I didn't understand until
just now...

1035
01:19:17,024 --> 01:19:19,224
watching that stupid cat.

1036
01:19:27,305 --> 01:19:29,885
After your first Games...

1037
01:19:29,985 --> 01:19:33,145
I thought the whole romance
was an act.

1038
01:19:35,185 --> 01:19:38,046
We all expected you to continue
that strategy.

1039
01:19:38,146 --> 01:19:41,406
But it wasn't until Peeta's
heart stopped...

1040
01:19:41,506 --> 01:19:42,906
and he nearly died that

1041
01:19:45,546 --> 01:19:47,386
I knew I'd misjudged you.

1042
01:19:48,347 --> 01:19:49,507
You love him.

1043
01:19:51,947 --> 01:19:53,087
I'm not saying in what way.

1044
01:19:53,187 --> 01:19:54,927
Maybe you don't even know
yourself.

1045
01:19:55,027 --> 01:19:57,267
But anyone paying attention
can see it.

1046
01:19:58,707 --> 01:20:00,148
How do you live with it?

1047
01:20:02,628 --> 01:20:04,208
I drag myself outta nightmares...

1048
01:20:04,308 --> 01:20:07,168
and there's no relief in
waking up.

1049
01:20:07,268 --> 01:20:10,668
But, it's better not to give
in to it.

1050
01:20:13,029 --> 01:20:15,209
Takes ten times longer to put
yourself back together...

1051
01:20:15,309 --> 01:20:16,949
than it does to fall apart.

1052
01:20:26,830 --> 01:20:29,510
Katniss?
Katniss.

1053
01:20:30,470 --> 01:20:31,750
Come with me.

1054
01:20:37,351 --> 01:20:39,391
We took their best shot.
Didn't we?

1055
01:20:40,831 --> 01:20:42,691
Yeah.

1056
01:20:42,791 --> 01:20:44,251
Your mother and sister okay?

1057
01:20:44,351 --> 01:20:45,891
Yeah, they're fine.

1058
01:20:45,991 --> 01:20:48,491
I need you to do something
for us.

1059
01:20:48,591 --> 01:20:50,012
I need you to tell Panem...

1060
01:20:50,112 --> 01:20:52,252
that we survived an attack by
the Capitol...

1061
01:20:52,352 --> 01:20:54,172
with no casualties.

1062
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:56,312
And we remain fully operational.

1063
01:20:57,272 --> 01:20:58,312
Okay.

1064
01:20:59,272 --> 01:21:01,453
You should know something.

1065
01:21:01,553 --> 01:21:04,133
We had eight extra minutes
of civilian evacuation...

1066
01:21:04,233 --> 01:21:05,753
because of Peeta's warning.

1067
01:21:06,833 --> 01:21:08,313
I won't forget that.

1068
01:21:09,633 --> 01:21:11,193
Thank you.

1069
01:21:25,395 --> 01:21:27,175
So, Katniss...

1070
01:21:27,275 --> 01:21:30,275
it's "13 is alive and well,
and so am I."

1071
01:21:31,755 --> 01:21:32,795
Katniss?

1072
01:21:34,835 --> 01:21:35,915
Katniss.

1073
01:21:37,596 --> 01:21:40,036
Never one to waste it in
rehearsal, I know.

1074
01:22:42,361 --> 01:22:44,201
Why would they drop these?

1075
01:22:47,601 --> 01:22:49,061
For me.

1076
01:22:49,161 --> 01:22:50,681
Ready to go, Katniss?

1077
01:22:52,402 --> 01:22:53,882
We're gonna do this, just like
District 8.

1078
01:22:57,402 --> 01:22:58,722
Tell me about the roses.

1079
01:23:04,203 --> 01:23:08,203
Tell Snow, 13 is alive and well.

1080
01:23:12,683 --> 01:23:13,943
He's gonna kill Peeta.

1081
01:23:14,043 --> 01:23:15,023
Let's try again.
Can you speak up?

1082
01:23:15,123 --> 01:23:16,704
We don't have a mic on you.

1083
01:23:16,804 --> 01:23:20,244
"13 is alive and well, and so
am I."

1084
01:23:23,444 --> 01:23:25,284
He's gonna kill Peeta.

1085
01:23:28,125 --> 01:23:29,105
I can't.

1086
01:23:29,205 --> 01:23:30,325
Katniss?

1087
01:23:32,125 --> 01:23:33,185
You can do it, Katniss.

1088
01:23:33,285 --> 01:23:34,585
I can't do this.

1089
01:23:34,685 --> 01:23:37,665
"13 is alive and well, and so
am I."

1090
01:23:37,765 --> 01:23:39,425
He's just gonna keep...

1091
01:23:39,525 --> 01:23:40,626
He's never gonna stop.

1092
01:23:40,726 --> 01:23:42,386
Cressida, we should cut the
cameras.

1093
01:23:42,486 --> 01:23:43,706
as long as I'm The Mockingjay.
It's okay, Katniss.

1094
01:23:43,806 --> 01:23:46,406
No. He warned me.
He warned me about this.

1095
01:23:48,046 --> 01:23:50,546
He's doing this because I'm
The Mockingjay.

1096
01:23:50,646 --> 01:23:51,967
He's punishing Peeta to
punish me.

1097
01:23:52,927 --> 01:23:54,047
No.

1098
01:23:55,767 --> 01:23:56,947
No, I can't do this.

1099
01:23:57,047 --> 01:23:57,987
Katniss.

1100
01:23:58,087 --> 01:24:00,387
Don't make me do this!

1101
01:24:00,487 --> 01:24:01,587
Let her go.

1102
01:24:01,687 --> 01:24:04,608
I gotta get out of here.

1103
01:24:23,169 --> 01:24:25,909
So, this is the end, huh?

1104
01:24:26,009 --> 01:24:28,409
Guess this means we're gonna
hide down here forever.

1105
01:24:29,410 --> 01:24:32,070
I can't be The Mockingjay.

1106
01:24:32,170 --> 01:24:34,810
Not "The Mockingjay."
Just Katniss.

1107
01:24:37,410 --> 01:24:39,790
You know, you're the only...

1108
01:24:39,890 --> 01:24:41,811
real friend I have down here.

1109
01:24:46,171 --> 01:24:48,111
I don't suppose they gave you...

1110
01:24:48,211 --> 01:24:50,551
any kind of... medication?

1111
01:24:50,651 --> 01:24:51,831
You're unbelievable.

1112
01:24:51,931 --> 01:24:55,112
Okay, but I meant what I said.

1113
01:24:55,212 --> 01:24:57,732
Look, the reason I'm here is
to let you know...

1114
01:24:58,692 --> 01:25:00,172
they're rescuing Peeta.

1115
01:25:01,652 --> 01:25:02,872
What?

1116
01:25:02,972 --> 01:25:04,792
The dam going down in
District 5...

1117
01:25:04,892 --> 01:25:06,633
took out most of the power to
the Capitol.

1118
01:25:06,733 --> 01:25:08,633
Knocked out their signal defense.

1119
01:25:08,733 --> 01:25:10,513
Beetee's inside their system
now...

1120
01:25:10,613 --> 01:25:11,933
wreaking all kinds of havoc.

1121
01:25:12,893 --> 01:25:14,473
A window is open to us.

1122
01:25:14,573 --> 01:25:15,513
How much longer?
I don't know.

1123
01:25:15,613 --> 01:25:16,753
I guess until the Capitol...

1124
01:25:16,853 --> 01:25:17,914
can get the power back on.

1125
01:25:18,014 --> 01:25:19,554
And President Coin?

1126
01:25:19,654 --> 01:25:22,394
You know, I can never fully
support that woman...

1127
01:25:22,494 --> 01:25:25,234
in light of the prohibition...

1128
01:25:25,334 --> 01:25:27,154
they have going on around
this place...

1129
01:25:27,254 --> 01:25:29,915
but Plutarch got word...

1130
01:25:30,015 --> 01:25:32,595
that Peeta and the others are
in the Tribute Center.

1131
01:25:32,695 --> 01:25:33,955
And with the power out...

1132
01:25:34,055 --> 01:25:35,875
Coin sees this as an opportunity.

1133
01:25:35,975 --> 01:25:37,715
She knows that Peeta..

1134
01:25:37,815 --> 01:25:39,875
is the Capitol's weapon.
The same way you're ours.

1135
01:25:39,975 --> 01:25:41,595
And as opposed to having you
two...

1136
01:25:41,695 --> 01:25:43,516
pointing at each other...

1137
01:25:43,616 --> 01:25:44,896
she's going to get him.

1138
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:47,196
I have to go help.

1139
01:25:47,296 --> 01:25:49,316
Hey, hey, whoa, kiddo.
Wait.

1140
01:25:49,416 --> 01:25:51,276
Come on. What, are you just
gonna jump outta the vent...

1141
01:25:51,376 --> 01:25:52,436
and go storm the Capitol?

1142
01:25:52,536 --> 01:25:55,637
Besides, it's already underway.

1143
01:25:55,737 --> 01:25:58,837
Six soldiers went in.
Volunteer only.

1144
01:25:58,937 --> 01:26:01,577
And guess who was the first
brave soul to sign up?

1145
01:26:02,537 --> 01:26:03,897
Gale.

1146
01:26:13,258 --> 01:26:15,278
Okay, Finnick?
Yeah. Yeah.

1147
01:26:15,378 --> 01:26:18,378
Go in the center, there.
Those rocks.

1148
01:26:22,579 --> 01:26:24,639
Castor, to left.

1149
01:26:24,739 --> 01:26:26,559
Pollux, you're with me.

1150
01:26:26,659 --> 01:26:28,639
So, we'll go straight to camera.

1151
01:26:28,739 --> 01:26:30,880
Okay?
Finnick?

1152
01:26:30,980 --> 01:26:32,480
Yeah.

1153
01:26:32,580 --> 01:26:34,160
Okay.

1154
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:35,920
Take your time.

1155
01:26:36,020 --> 01:26:38,220
Just remember to keep talking
and don't stop.

1156
01:26:41,639 --> 01:26:44,550
This is Finnick Odair.

1157
01:26:44,901 --> 01:26:47,921
Winner of the 65th Hunger Games.

1158
01:26:48,021 --> 01:26:51,281
And I'm coming to you from
District 13, alive and well.

1159
01:26:51,381 --> 01:26:54,561
We've survived an assault
from the Capitol.

1160
01:26:54,661 --> 01:26:57,122
But, I'm not here to give you
recent news.

1161
01:26:57,222 --> 01:26:59,202
Why is Finnick doing a propo?

1162
01:26:59,302 --> 01:27:00,922
It's a lot more than that.

1163
01:27:01,022 --> 01:27:02,802
Beetee's commandeered the
system.

1164
01:27:02,902 --> 01:27:04,722
Now that they're down to
generator power...

1165
01:27:04,822 --> 01:27:06,802
there's a more limited range of
frequencies available to them.

1166
01:27:06,902 --> 01:27:08,563
And I'm filling them all up
with Finnick.

1167
01:27:08,663 --> 01:27:10,203
Not many will see it, but
whoever does...

1168
01:27:10,303 --> 01:27:11,883
will think it's another propo.

1169
01:27:11,983 --> 01:27:13,403
What they don't know is this
broadcast...

1170
01:27:13,503 --> 01:27:15,363
is jamming their entire system
with noise.

1171
01:27:15,463 --> 01:27:17,803
Early defense warning, internal
communications, everything.

1172
01:27:17,903 --> 01:27:19,603
As long as the broadcast goes
through...

1173
01:27:19,703 --> 01:27:22,164
our team should be able to get
in and out undetected.

1174
01:27:22,264 --> 01:27:25,124
The truth. Not the myths about
a life of luxury.

1175
01:27:25,224 --> 01:27:28,044
Not the lie about glory for
your homeland.

1176
01:27:28,144 --> 01:27:30,404
You can't survive the arena.

1177
01:27:30,504 --> 01:27:32,425
The moment you leave, you're
a slave.

1178
01:27:45,706 --> 01:27:47,406
Mockingjay One, Mockingjay One...

1179
01:27:47,506 --> 01:27:49,366
you are one minute out from
perimeter defense.

1180
01:27:49,466 --> 01:27:50,740
Going dark.

1181
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:53,200
Stay low, in case they're online.

1182
01:27:54,186 --> 01:27:56,887
President Snow used to sell me.

1183
01:27:56,987 --> 01:27:59,727
Or my body, at least.
I wasn't the only one.

1184
01:27:59,827 --> 01:28:01,963
If a Victor is considered
desirable...

1185
01:28:02,063 --> 01:28:03,434
the President gives them as
a reward...

1186
01:28:03,650 --> 01:28:05,462
or allows people to buy them.

1187
01:28:05,562 --> 01:28:08,487
If you refuse, he kills someone
you love.

1188
01:28:08,587 --> 01:28:11,388
Mockingjay One, you are 20 seconds
from perimeter defense.

1189
01:28:17,068 --> 01:28:18,008
Ten seconds.

1190
01:28:18,108 --> 01:28:20,168
Nine... eight...

1191
01:28:20,268 --> 01:28:23,689
seven... six... five...

1192
01:28:23,789 --> 01:28:26,329
four... three... two...

1193
01:28:27,389 --> 01:28:28,349
One.

1194
01:28:36,430 --> 01:28:37,930
No response from perimeter
defense.

1195
01:28:38,030 --> 01:28:39,330
We're inside Capitol airspace.

1196
01:28:39,430 --> 01:28:41,290
To make themselves feel better...

1197
01:28:41,390 --> 01:28:43,930
my patrons would make presents
of money, or jewelry.

1198
01:28:44,030 --> 01:28:48,611
But I found a much more valuable
form of payment.

1199
01:28:48,711 --> 01:28:49,571
Secrets.

1200
01:28:49,671 --> 01:28:50,911
Gear up.

1201
01:29:10,953 --> 01:29:11,953
Switching to Night View.

1202
01:29:20,273 --> 01:29:21,633
There.

1203
01:29:24,514 --> 01:29:27,014
Command, we have visual on the
Tribute Center.

1204
01:29:27,114 --> 01:29:28,874
Initiating final approach.

1205
01:29:33,234 --> 01:29:34,355
Masks on.

1206
01:29:39,795 --> 01:29:41,655
See, I know all the depravity...

1207
01:29:41,755 --> 01:29:43,135
the deceit and the cruelty...

1208
01:29:43,235 --> 01:29:46,376
of the Capitol's pampered elite.

1209
01:29:46,476 --> 01:29:48,136
But the biggest secrets are
about...

1210
01:29:48,236 --> 01:29:50,396
our good President, Coriolanus
Snow.

1211
01:29:58,116 --> 01:29:59,157
Open the door.

1212
01:30:08,517 --> 01:30:10,177
Command, this is Team Leader.

1213
01:30:10,277 --> 01:30:12,718
Prepare to deploy gas.
We will confirm once inside.

1214
01:30:16,838 --> 01:30:18,258
Such a young man when he rose
to power.

1215
01:30:18,358 --> 01:30:19,858
Such a clever one to keep it.

1216
01:30:19,958 --> 01:30:22,998
How, you may ask, did he do it?

1217
01:30:24,839 --> 01:30:25,879
One word.

1218
01:30:26,839 --> 01:30:27,919
Poison.

1219
01:30:34,399 --> 01:30:35,480
Get ready to drop.

1220
01:31:02,442 --> 01:31:04,442
He stopped every mutiny before
it even started.

1221
01:31:15,483 --> 01:31:16,443
Clear.

1222
01:31:20,283 --> 01:31:22,263
Clear.
Command, we're inside.

1223
01:31:22,363 --> 01:31:24,224
Heading toward target number
one.

1224
01:31:24,324 --> 01:31:26,604
Cell P45, lower level 2C.

1225
01:31:27,964 --> 01:31:29,304
Gas.

1226
01:31:29,404 --> 01:31:31,024
There are so many mysterious
deaths...

1227
01:31:31,124 --> 01:31:32,284
to adversaries.

1228
01:31:34,044 --> 01:31:35,964
Even to allies who were threats.

1229
01:31:47,165 --> 01:31:48,345
Snow would drink from the
same cup...

1230
01:31:48,445 --> 01:31:49,986
to deflect suspicion.

1231
01:31:50,086 --> 01:31:52,986
But antidotes don't always
work...

1232
01:31:53,086 --> 01:31:55,866
which is why he wears roses
that reek of perfume.

1233
01:31:55,966 --> 01:31:58,106
Help cover the scent of blood
from sores...

1234
01:31:58,206 --> 01:32:00,246
in his mouth, that will
never heal.

1235
01:32:24,048 --> 01:32:25,168
Gale.

1236
01:32:29,529 --> 01:32:31,589
But he can't hide the scent
of who he really is.

1237
01:32:31,689 --> 01:32:33,789
He kills without mercy.

1238
01:32:33,889 --> 01:32:36,209
He rules with deception and
fear.

1239
01:33:00,571 --> 01:33:02,072
His weapon of choice...

1240
01:33:02,172 --> 01:33:04,032
is the only thing suited to
such a man.

1241
01:33:04,132 --> 01:33:05,272
Poison.

1242
01:33:05,372 --> 01:33:07,452
The perfect weapon for a snake.

1243
01:33:09,892 --> 01:33:11,132
What is this place?

1244
01:33:21,733 --> 01:33:23,233
Beetee?
I'm losing them.

1245
01:33:23,333 --> 01:33:24,733
Powering back up.

1246
01:33:26,694 --> 01:33:28,234
Ma'am, the Capitol air defense
system...

1247
01:33:28,334 --> 01:33:30,114
is rebooting.
It's coming back online.

1248
01:33:30,214 --> 01:33:31,354
Must be diverting power from
another source.

1249
01:33:31,454 --> 01:33:32,834
And filtering transmissions.

1250
01:33:32,934 --> 01:33:34,714
Another 60 seconds and we'll
be cut off.

1251
01:33:34,814 --> 01:33:36,614
Madam President, should we call
back the hovercraft?

1252
01:33:38,534 --> 01:33:40,355
Broadcast me.

1253
01:33:40,455 --> 01:33:41,915
If Snow's watching this, maybe
he'll let the signal in...

1254
01:33:42,015 --> 01:33:44,195
if he sees me.

1255
01:33:44,295 --> 01:33:45,715
Put me on the air, so he can
see me.

1256
01:33:45,815 --> 01:33:47,155
Yes.
Yes.

1257
01:33:47,255 --> 01:33:48,515
Put her on.

1258
01:33:48,615 --> 01:33:50,836
Can we do this?
Can we still get in?

1259
01:33:50,936 --> 01:33:51,956
Yes.
For the moment.

1260
01:33:52,056 --> 01:33:53,196
The line's open.
He will only see you.

1261
01:33:53,296 --> 01:33:55,076
Okay, Katniss, go.

1262
01:33:55,176 --> 01:33:56,196
President Snow?

1263
01:33:56,296 --> 01:33:58,196
President Snow.
It's Katniss.

1264
01:33:58,296 --> 01:34:00,836
There's no guarantee he's
even watching.

1265
01:34:00,936 --> 01:34:02,476
I know, but he might be.

1266
01:34:02,576 --> 01:34:04,517
President Snow, I need to
speak with you.

1267
01:34:04,617 --> 01:34:06,877
Are you there?

1268
01:34:06,977 --> 01:34:10,457
President Snow, it's Katniss.
Can you hear me?

1269
01:34:11,657 --> 01:34:13,177
I need to speak with you.

1270
01:34:15,338 --> 01:34:17,118
President Snow, it's Katniss.

1271
01:34:17,218 --> 01:34:18,998
President Snow...

1272
01:34:19,098 --> 01:34:20,298
are you there?

1273
01:34:23,298 --> 01:34:24,818
Can you hear me?

1274
01:34:29,979 --> 01:34:31,479
President Snow...

1275
01:34:31,579 --> 01:34:33,699
Miss Everdeen.
What an honor.

1276
01:34:35,699 --> 01:34:37,639
I don't imagine you're calling...

1277
01:34:37,739 --> 01:34:39,499
to thank me for the roses.

1278
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:42,860
I never asked for this.

1279
01:34:44,420 --> 01:34:46,120
I never asked to be in
the Games.

1280
01:34:46,220 --> 01:34:47,920
Boggs?
Come in. Boggs?

1281
01:34:48,020 --> 01:34:49,220
I never asked to be The
Mockingjay.

1282
01:34:50,940 --> 01:34:52,881
Just wanted to save my sister...

1283
01:34:52,981 --> 01:34:54,641
and keep Peeta alive.

1284
01:34:54,741 --> 01:34:57,721
Come in.
Boggs?

1285
01:34:57,821 --> 01:34:59,401
Please, just let him go...

1286
01:34:59,501 --> 01:35:01,321
and I will stop being The
Mockingjay.

1287
01:35:01,421 --> 01:35:03,521
I will disappear. You will never
have to see me, ever again.

1288
01:35:03,621 --> 01:35:05,162
Miss Everdeen...

1289
01:35:05,262 --> 01:35:06,762
Boggs, come in.

1290
01:35:06,862 --> 01:35:07,962
you couldn't run from this...

1291
01:35:08,062 --> 01:35:10,002
Copy.

1292
01:35:10,102 --> 01:35:12,122
any more than you could have
run from the Games.

1293
01:35:12,222 --> 01:35:14,562
Command, I need a situation
report.

1294
01:35:14,662 --> 01:35:16,743
Boggs, we're running out of time.
Hurry.

1295
01:35:18,503 --> 01:35:19,403
Let's move.

1296
01:35:19,503 --> 01:35:20,643
Please.

1297
01:35:20,743 --> 01:35:22,223
You've won.

1298
01:35:25,623 --> 01:35:26,703
You've already beaten me.

1299
01:35:30,264 --> 01:35:32,784
Release Peeta.
And take me instead.

1300
01:35:35,024 --> 01:35:37,924
We're long past the opportunity...

1301
01:35:38,024 --> 01:35:39,884
for noble sacrifice.

1302
01:35:39,984 --> 01:35:41,845
Then tell me what to do.

1303
01:35:41,945 --> 01:35:43,885
I've always kept my promises,
haven't I?

1304
01:35:43,985 --> 01:35:46,685
You said you didn't want a war...

1305
01:35:46,785 --> 01:35:48,505
and that's just what's happened.

1306
01:35:50,145 --> 01:35:53,166
I told you what a fragile thing
peace was...

1307
01:35:53,266 --> 01:35:54,886
and still, like a child...

1308
01:35:54,986 --> 01:35:57,266
you took pleasure in breaking it.

1309
01:35:58,986 --> 01:36:00,926
I know what you are.

1310
01:36:01,026 --> 01:36:04,526
I know you can't see past your
narrowest concerns.

1311
01:36:04,626 --> 01:36:06,307
But please, Miss Everdeen.

1312
01:36:07,587 --> 01:36:10,447
I doubt you know what honesty
is, anymore.

1313
01:36:10,547 --> 01:36:11,607
Command, we're at the first
target.

1314
01:36:11,707 --> 01:36:13,247
Preparing to extract Peeta.

1315
01:36:13,347 --> 01:36:14,507
Will confirm when he's in hand.

1316
01:36:18,028 --> 01:36:19,728
Mockingjay One, prepare hovercraft
for evac.

1317
01:36:19,828 --> 01:36:20,928
You asked me to convince you...

1318
01:36:21,028 --> 01:36:22,688
that I was in love with Peeta.

1319
01:36:22,788 --> 01:36:24,268
Haven't I at least done that?

1320
01:36:25,628 --> 01:36:27,028
Miss Everdeen...

1321
01:36:28,988 --> 01:36:31,589
it's the things we love most...

1322
01:36:32,549 --> 01:36:33,909
that destroy us.

1323
01:36:36,109 --> 01:36:39,589
I want you to remember that
I said that.

1324
01:36:45,190 --> 01:36:46,610
Don't you think I know...

1325
01:36:46,710 --> 01:36:48,150
your friends are in the Tribute
Center?

1326
01:36:50,870 --> 01:36:51,950
Cut them off.

1327
01:36:53,430 --> 01:36:54,811
What happened?
Boggs, come in.

1328
01:36:54,911 --> 01:36:56,211
What happened?

1329
01:36:56,311 --> 01:36:58,451
Boggs, come in.
Do you read me?

1330
01:36:58,551 --> 01:36:59,731
He knows that they're in there.

1331
01:36:59,831 --> 01:37:01,211
It's a trap.
Katniss, hold it.

1332
01:37:01,311 --> 01:37:02,531
We have to get a hold of them.

1333
01:37:02,631 --> 01:37:04,171
We have to tell them to get out.
He knows.

1334
01:37:04,271 --> 01:37:06,051
There's no signal.
We can't contact them.

1335
01:37:06,151 --> 01:37:07,692
No.
Haymitch...

1336
01:37:07,792 --> 01:37:09,892
he knew the whole time.
He was taunting me.

1337
01:37:09,992 --> 01:37:12,212
No, Haymitch. They're in there.
No, we don't know that.

1338
01:37:12,312 --> 01:37:13,811
Did I lose them both tonight?

1339
01:37:14,232 --> 01:37:15,892
Did I lose them both tonight?

1340
01:37:15,992 --> 01:37:18,452
Did I lose them both tonight?
Shh.

1341
01:37:18,552 --> 01:37:21,493
Did I lose them?
I lost them both.

1342
01:37:21,593 --> 01:37:23,233
No!
No!

1343
01:37:31,994 --> 01:37:32,994
There's no news.

1344
01:37:35,194 --> 01:37:36,314
I'm sorry.

1345
01:37:39,634 --> 01:37:41,634
It's the worst torture in
the world.

1346
01:37:43,955 --> 01:37:46,675
Waiting, when you know there's
nothing you can do.

1347
01:37:52,075 --> 01:37:54,115
Especially for people like us.

1348
01:37:55,235 --> 01:37:59,196
But whatever strength, courage...

1349
01:38:00,156 --> 01:38:01,516
madness...

1350
01:38:02,716 --> 01:38:04,496
keeps us going, you find it...

1351
01:38:04,596 --> 01:38:05,876
at times like these.

1352
01:38:08,837 --> 01:38:11,377
You have it, soldier.

1353
01:38:11,477 --> 01:38:13,637
It's what's kept you alive
all this time.

1354
01:38:15,197 --> 01:38:16,877
And it won't fail you now.

1355
01:38:38,279 --> 01:38:39,479
They're back.

1356
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:48,880
I don't want that.

1357
01:38:53,680 --> 01:38:55,220
Johanna.

1358
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:56,280
Finnick!

1359
01:38:57,761 --> 01:38:59,141
Finnick!

1360
01:38:59,241 --> 01:39:01,681
Annie?
Annie!

1361
01:39:05,601 --> 01:39:07,521
You're safe.
You're safe.

1362
01:39:14,562 --> 01:39:15,802
Gale!

1363
01:39:18,922 --> 01:39:19,962
Are you okay?

1364
01:39:21,603 --> 01:39:23,023
What?
What is it?

1365
01:39:23,123 --> 01:39:24,423
I don't get it.

1366
01:39:24,523 --> 01:39:25,903
Every gun was back online...

1367
01:39:26,003 --> 01:39:27,923
and on us and we flew right
past them.

1368
01:39:28,883 --> 01:39:30,003
They let us go.

1369
01:39:35,284 --> 01:39:36,284
He's in there.

1370
01:39:38,604 --> 01:39:39,904
Gas we used on the guards...

1371
01:39:40,004 --> 01:39:41,804
knocked him out, too, but it's
wearing off now.

1372
01:39:44,284 --> 01:39:45,885
You should be there when he
wakes up.

1373
01:39:51,005 --> 01:39:52,205
Thank you.

1374
01:39:55,205 --> 01:39:56,285
Thank you.

1375
01:40:15,967 --> 01:40:17,127
Peeta.

1376
01:40:49,810 --> 01:40:51,510
Peeta!

1377
01:40:51,610 --> 01:40:54,790
Peeta! Get off!
Get off of her!

1378
01:40:54,890 --> 01:40:56,890
Let go!

1379
01:41:30,093 --> 01:41:32,073
No, Katniss. No, you're a little
swollen. Don't touch.

1380
01:41:32,173 --> 01:41:33,713
No, no, no.
Calm down.

1381
01:41:33,813 --> 01:41:35,334
Calm down.
You're okay.

1382
01:41:38,134 --> 01:41:39,494
Tell her she's awake.

1383
01:41:41,934 --> 01:41:43,514
Don't try to talk.

1384
01:41:43,614 --> 01:41:44,774
Peeta's okay.
I promise.

1385
01:41:45,970 --> 01:41:47,595
I just had to get him off you.

1386
01:41:54,135 --> 01:41:56,439
It's called "hijacking."

1387
01:41:57,347 --> 01:41:59,041
We don't know how long the
Capitol's been doing this...

1388
01:41:59,141 --> 01:42:00,542
to Peeta.

1389
01:42:01,176 --> 01:42:02,796
It's fear conditioning...

1390
01:42:02,896 --> 01:42:05,356
enhanced with tracker jacker
venom.

1391
01:42:05,456 --> 01:42:08,556
You were stung in your first
Games, remember?

1392
01:42:08,656 --> 01:42:11,216
The venom puts the subject in
a dissociative state.

1393
01:42:12,217 --> 01:42:15,477
And they torture him...

1394
01:42:15,577 --> 01:42:19,197
with shocks and beatings, and
strip down his identity.

1395
01:42:19,297 --> 01:42:21,917
And then, all of that suffering
and fear is redirected.

1396
01:42:22,017 --> 01:42:25,098
Associated with other memories,
or a person.

1397
01:42:26,858 --> 01:42:28,838
They can change his memories
of Katniss?

1398
01:42:28,938 --> 01:42:29,918
To make her seem life-threatening.

1399
01:42:31,778 --> 01:42:33,658
They turned him into a weapon,
Katniss.

1400
01:42:34,618 --> 01:42:35,778
To kill you.

1401
01:42:37,299 --> 01:42:38,959
But, you can reverse it?

1402
01:42:39,059 --> 01:42:40,439
The fear is the most difficult
thing to overcome.

1403
01:42:40,539 --> 01:42:43,159
We're hardwired to remember
fear best.

1404
01:42:43,259 --> 01:42:44,459
It's new terrain.

1405
01:42:46,019 --> 01:42:47,779
But we've put together a team.

1406
01:42:48,740 --> 01:42:50,700
I'm optimistic.

1407
01:43:16,182 --> 01:43:17,422
Good evening.

1408
01:43:18,662 --> 01:43:20,402
Yesterday, I authorized...

1409
01:43:20,502 --> 01:43:23,722
a covert rescue mission inside
the Capitol.

1410
01:43:23,822 --> 01:43:26,563
I am pleased to announce...

1411
01:43:26,663 --> 01:43:29,303
that the Victors have been
liberated!

1412
01:43:35,743 --> 01:43:40,444
Let this day mark an historic
change.

1413
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:43,724
With The Mockingjay and the
Victors beside us...

1414
01:43:43,824 --> 01:43:47,284
we have sent a clear message
to the Capitol.

1415
01:43:47,384 --> 01:43:51,225
That we will never again endure
injustice.

1416
01:43:56,265 --> 01:43:57,685
Today...

1417
01:43:57,785 --> 01:44:01,045
a day on which we reunited
family...

1418
01:44:01,145 --> 01:44:04,526
friends, and loved ones.

1419
01:44:04,626 --> 01:44:09,206
Let all of Panem come together.

1420
01:44:09,306 --> 01:44:13,126
Not to battle for the amusement
of the Capitol...

1421
01:44:13,226 --> 01:44:16,147
but to join hands in this fight.

1422
01:44:22,787 --> 01:44:25,047
Let today be the day we promise...

1423
01:44:25,147 --> 01:44:28,728
never to give up, never to
give in...

1424
01:44:28,828 --> 01:44:31,648
until we have made a new Panem...

1425
01:44:31,748 --> 01:44:35,768
where leaders are elected, not
imposed upon us.

1426
01:44:35,868 --> 01:44:37,928
And where the districts are
free...

1427
01:44:38,028 --> 01:44:40,249
to share the fruits of their
labors...

1428
01:44:40,349 --> 01:44:42,829
and not fight one another
for scraps!

1429
01:44:55,350 --> 01:44:57,530
This new Panem is on the horizon.

1430
01:44:57,630 --> 01:45:00,570
But we must take it for ourselves.

1431
01:45:00,670 --> 01:45:04,571
The road there leads through
the sharp mountains...

1432
01:45:04,671 --> 01:45:07,851
and deep ravines of District 2.

1433
01:45:07,951 --> 01:45:09,851
There, in the heart...

1434
01:45:09,951 --> 01:45:11,642
of Panem's steepest mountain
range...

1435
01:45:11,858 --> 01:45:15,512
lies the Capitol's principal
military facility.

1436
01:45:16,672 --> 01:45:19,452
We can conquer this stronghold...

1437
01:45:19,552 --> 01:45:22,492
because we are one people...

1438
01:45:22,592 --> 01:45:26,012
one army, one voice.

1439
01:45:26,112 --> 01:45:30,493
Because today is our new
beginning.

1440
01:45:30,593 --> 01:45:33,913
Today we have freed the Victors.

1441
01:45:34,873 --> 01:45:37,873
Tomorrow... Panem!

1442
01:45:45,794 --> 01:45:49,634
Hoorah!
Hoorah!
