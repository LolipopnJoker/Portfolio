1
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,488
Come on, Jake, slow down.

2
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,073
Hurry up.

3
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:34,616
Melanie!

4
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:37,953
We gotta get home
or Mom's gonna kill me.

5
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,538
Wow, did you see that?

6
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:42,458
1,001 , 1,002. . .

7
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,794
- Answer the question!
- No!

8
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:48,881
No, you won't answer,
or you won't marry me?

9
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:53,177
Jake Perry, I'm ten years old.
I got too much to live for.

10
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,223
Not that way, you don't. Come on!

11
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,564
Wow! Cool.

12
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,858
It's hot. Don't touch it.

13
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,610
We'll be safe here.

14
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:10,903
Says who?

15
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:12,362
Everybody.

16
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:17,159
Lightning never strikes
the same place twice.

17
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,331
Why would you want to marry me,
anyhow?

18
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:26,043
So I can kiss you any time I want.

19
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,165
Oh, my God.

20
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,712
Hi.

21
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:16,343
That accent of yours is a lot thicker
when you're dreaming.

22
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,595
How come y'all let me sleep?

23
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:22,307
- Calm down. It was five minutes.
- What did I say?

24
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:26,311
We're all getting big raises
when you become somebody.

25
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:29,148
Did they kill Badgley Mischka.

26
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,358
Laugh now, tomorrow it could be us.

27
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:34,319
Not us, you. I just make the coffee.

28
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:36,029
Thank you.

29
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:46,748
Thanks for the long night.
I'll see you at the show.

30
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,251
See you later. Get some rest.

31
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,861
Andrew.

32
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:04,076
Honey, there's a rose for every
moment I thought of you last night.

33
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,954
You must be exhausted.
Knock 'em dead.

34
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:11,083
I'll see you at the show.
It's gonna be great. I love you.

35
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,543
I can't wait to see you. Goodbye.

36
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:26,098
OK, people we are officially late!

37
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,975
- Melanie!
- Yes?

38
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:32,646
This top is supposed to be neon
aubergine but it's all wrong!

39
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:36,400
OK, don't panic. That's my job.
Put her on after Anouk.

40
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,528
The light cue is yellow.
She'll look eggplant.

41
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:42,489
Pan, it's wrong
because it's on backwards.

42
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,117
Miss Dixie, I'm scared of you!

43
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:48,245
Frederick, why are you here?
You're the competition.

44
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,123
Competition? Please!
Our designs are pearls.

45
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,709
Nothing comes between me
and my protegee.

46
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,003
This is, after all, all about me.

47
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:59,006
I love this. Stella McCartney's
gonna kill herself.

48
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,883
Why do I feel
like I'm in Times Square, naked?

49
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:06,930
You'll be fine. Seven years ago, you
were a debutante off the plantation.

50
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,642
Now you're my steel magnolia,
with her very own show.

51
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,853
Get out before you make me cry.

52
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,188
Bonne chance.

53
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:31,371
Secretary Hennings,
do you have a moment?

54
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,340
Please tell me
he has a flaw somewhere.

55
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:44,551
He asked me
to go to Ireland for Christmas.

56
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,804
He's going to ask you
a lot more than that.

57
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,848
You think so?

58
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:53,268
- It's time, let's do this.
- Alright, we got to go.

59
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,644
Places, everyone.

60
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:59,024
Let's go. Line up. OK, don't smile.
No smiles, just smirks.

61
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:04,613
Wait.

62
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,948
OK, go.

63
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,047
Honey!

64
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:25,092
- Congratulations.
- You're amazing.

65
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:28,428
- The flowers were insane.
- I want this day to be perfect.

66
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:32,224
- God, what if they hate me?
- Critics hate themselves.

67
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:35,268
Easy for you to say.
I don't have thick Hennings skin.

68
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:39,106
No, you don't.
And that is what I love about you.

69
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:44,486
I'm sorry. I have a meeting.
You enjoy it and I'll see you later.

70
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:47,489
We've got that thing tonight
at Lincoln Center.

71
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:49,866
- What thing?
- Fundraiser thing.

72
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:54,913
Right. The thing.
With your mother. That's tonight.

73
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,249
- I'm afraid so.
- OK.

74
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,876
I am so proud of you.

75
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,629
- Thank you.
- OK.

76
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,799
- I love you.
- I love you, too. Congratulations.

77
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:28,822
His meeting's running late.
He told me to take you inside.

78
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,282
Where are we?

79
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,830
- I'm so tired, Jimmy.
- Yeah.

80
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,709
- I've just had it.
- He shouldn't be too long.

81
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,671
Miss Carmichael, won't you come in?

82
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:56,057
So, have you made a decision?

83
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:59,102
- About what?
- Ireland.

84
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,647
Ireland, honey?
That's four months from now.

85
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:04,274
I was thinking
maybe. . .

86
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:07,486
. ..2-300 guests, tops.

87
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:12,282
For Christmas?
Are you on some sort of medication?

88
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,784
What's going on? Where are we?

89
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,683
Oh, my God!

90
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:53,990
Melanie Carmichael,
will you marry me?

91
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:59,704
Are you sure?
I mean, are you really sure?

92
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,290
If you're not,
we can just go back to the car.

93
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,794
- It's only been eight months.
- I never do anything rash.

94
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:09,089
I never ask a question
I don't know the answer to.

95
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:13,760
So at the risk
of being rejected twice,

96
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,179
I'm gonna ask you again.

97
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,726
Will you marry me?

98
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,689
Yes.

99
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,532
Pick one.

100
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:56,553
- Mayor, just one shot.
- Over here, Mayor.

101
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,598
- Where is he?
- Running late.

102
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,516
Thanks to that Carbuncle girl.

103
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,477
- Carmichael, designer, Southern.
- Whatever.

104
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,149
Your Honour, how do you answer

105
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:12,694
those who oppose
your street-improvement project?

106
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:15,864
I suggest
they drive through Brooklyn.

107
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,783
Maybe they'll disappear in a pothole.

108
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:22,537
Sources say your son's
engaged to Melanie Carmichael.

109
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,039
Do you have a comment?

110
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:27,876
Trust me if my son were engaged,
I'd have a comment.

111
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:34,674
- I thought you were tired.
- Jimmy, excuse us.

112
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:42,599
I planned this for weeks.
This thing tonight is perfect.

113
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,644
I can't wait to see my mother's face.

114
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:48,772
- Come on, let's call your parents.
- No!

115
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:52,192
I mean, not right this second.

116
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,695
What I mean is, would you mind

117
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,782
if we kept this to ourselves
for a few days?

118
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,951
Mel, it'll come out sooner or later.

119
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:06,539
I know but I haven't seen my folks
in about seven years.

120
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:11,002
I just feel like I should
probably tell them in person.

121
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,962
Of course.

122
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:17,634
And I think I should do it alone.

123
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:21,179
Mel, I'll have to meet them
eventually.

124
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,849
I know. And they will love you.
Eventually.

125
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:32,565
- Is it because I'm a Yankee?
- Well, that, and a Democrat.

126
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,863
OK. Mum's the word.

127
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,408
- No one will know.
- Thank you.

128
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:47,038
Secretary Hennings.

129
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,336
Hello.

130
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,009
Have you told your mother
you're engaged?

131
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,471
Sorry we're late.

132
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:06,474
That lipstick doesn't suit you.
What kept you?

133
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,352
- None of your business.
- What's going on?

134
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,063
Tom, always a pleasure.
Good to see you.

135
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:15,024
Melanie, darling.
So good to see you.

136
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,652
Look at you, the belle of the ball.

137
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,738
I hear your new line is good.

138
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:22,115
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

139
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,081
- Andrew.
- Yes?

140
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:34,127
Melanie is wearing a skating rink
on an important finger.

141
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:37,213
- I'd like to keep this. . .
- Oh, my God!

142
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,798
You're engaged?

143
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,469
. .quiet.

144
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,361
I'm your first New York friend

145
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:03,406
and I read about it
with 1 2 million other people.

146
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,326
Sorry. She grabbed my hand.
What could I do?

147
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:09,120
I know. We read about it.
Did you cry?

148
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,747
Wouldn't you?

149
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:14,793
One man for the rest of my life?
I'd bawl. Come and meet us.

150
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:19,589
I can't. I'm in Alabama.

151
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,384
Oh, my God.

152
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,179
Yeah.

153
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:49,721
He's loud, but he don't bite.
Shut up, hound

154
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,598
Lie down.

155
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,224
Come on, stay.

156
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,435
How can I help you?

157
00:14:55,644 --> 00:15:00,231
Well, you can get your stubborn ass
down here and give me a divorce.

158
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,323
Jake, I mean it. The joke's over.

159
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:11,784
Let's finish this.
I've got a plane to catch.

160
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,039
You're shitting me, right?

161
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:20,460
I never understood that expression,
but no, I'm not shitting you.

162
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:25,006
Look, it's even got these
idiot-proof tabs to make it easy.

163
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:28,927
One copy for me, one for you,
one for the lawyers.

164
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,516
What? Speak.

165
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:40,521
You show up here after seven years

166
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:45,443
without so much as a, "Hey, there,
Jake. Remember me, your wife?"

167
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:50,573
Or, "Hi, honey. Looking good.
How's the family?"

168
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,700
You expect me to say you look good?

169
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,453
Did the Piggly Wiggly
run out of soap?

170
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:59,207
They laugh at that up north,
or wherever you've been?

171
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:03,336
You knew where I was.
And don't pretend you missed me.

172
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:08,007
I missed you. But at this range,
my aim is bound to improve.

173
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:09,968
Is that a threat?

174
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:12,428
I've got a lawyer
charges $350 an hour.

175
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,264
He billed me every time
you sent these back.

176
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,308
I'm glad you got the message.

177
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,186
- Shut up, Bear!
- Shut up, Bryant!

178
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,693
What happened to Bear?

179
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:29,362
He died. You weren't here.

180
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,448
What are you doing?

181
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:36,035
Leaving. You should recognise
the gesture.

182
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,580
Could we try to keep
this as civilised as possible?

183
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,916
Please sign these so I can go home.

184
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,918
What do you know from home?

185
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,629
I bet your folks
don't know you're here.

186
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,339
That's my business.

187
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:51,551
Honey, those people
are the only family you got.

188
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,219
Don't "honey" me, honey!

189
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,263
Get your butt back in that car,

190
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:58,474
drive over and see 'em,
then maybe we'll talk.

191
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,436
Jake!

192
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,646
You dumb, stubborn, redneck hick!

193
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,566
You won't sign these
cos I want you to!

194
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,985
Wrong! I ain't signing

195
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,989
cos you've turned
into some hoity-toity Yankee bitch

196
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:16,617
and I'd like nothing better
than to piss you off!

197
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:33,134
What are you doing
with Mo SlideI's plane?

198
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,428
- That's my business!
- Fine!

199
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:36,679
Fine!

200
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,863
Divorce, my ass.

201
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,964
Hey, genius.

202
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,469
When you lock somebody out,

203
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:19,680
make sure they don't know
where the spare key is.

204
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:24,143
Well, see,
that's the thing about hide-a-keys.

205
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:27,563
It'd be nice if your wife
told you where it was.

206
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,191
I'm not your wife, Jake.

207
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,904
I'm just the first girl that climbed
in the back of your truck.

208
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,991
But you're right.

209
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:43,162
I have changed.
I don't even know that girl any more.

210
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:48,543
Well, then, allow me to remind you.

211
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:03,057
"Born into one of the wealthiest
families of Greenville, Alabama,

212
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:06,435
her daddy's in cotton
and all that that implies."

213
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,856
There is no listing for
an Earl Carmichael in Greenville.

214
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,190
Her high school?

215
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,485
No record of Melanie Carmichael
attending, ever.

216
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:18,656
Jesus! Whatever happened
to responsible journalism?

217
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:26,831
Something's wrong here.
Why would my son do this to me?

218
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,250
Maybe he loves her?

219
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:32,211
Please! This is classic rebound.

220
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,881
He's hurt from breaking up with. . .
Who was it?

221
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,675
Whitney Trusdale, lawyer,
San Francisco.

222
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,344
Yeah. There was a match
made in heaven.

223
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:44,348
Society, political family,
California.

224
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,851
All those electoral votes.

225
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,145
Get Andrew on the phone.

226
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:52,815
We only have a small window
for the Secretary of Housing.

227
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:56,903
Hold your questions
until after the presentation.

228
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,740
See the look on my Mom's face?
I thought her head would explode.

229
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:01,991
What'd she say?

230
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,410
I should date women like Mel,
not marry them.

231
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,204
- That's harsh.
- That's Mom.

232
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,581
- Thank you.
- Thanks a lot.

233
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,959
We hope to have
the Bronx Children's Hospital open. . .

234
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,961
Speak of the devil. Hello.

235
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,756
So, have you lovebirds set a date?

236
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,299
I plead the Fifth.

237
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,968
Try to keep your secrets,
I dare you.

238
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,595
You're in a better mood.

239
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,931
My approval rating
went up two points.

240
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,099
The public likes to know
I'm a mother.

241
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:31,854
- Always running for office.
- I'm only thinking of you. Say...

242
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:36,859
Do you have the Carmichaels' number
down there in Greenville?

243
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,737
I thought I should introduce myself.

244
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,697
I'd like to meet them first.

245
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,742
The press will be all over this.
Take it from me.

246
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,994
Happy couples don't sell.

247
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:52,250
If there are any skeletons in her
closet, we need to know about them.

248
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,547
You make clothes, right?

249
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,342
I design them.
There's a big difference.

250
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:04,011
You design anything with stripes?

251
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,639
You called the sheriff?

252
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:09,725
You know that old bastard hates me.

253
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,811
For good reason.

254
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:16,482
Well, hell's bells!
If it ain't Felony Melanie.

255
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:18,526
Wade?

256
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:23,698
Hot damn, girl,
do we miss you around here.

257
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,658
I saw poor Fuzz the other day.

258
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:28,619
You had to bring that up.
So, you're the Sheriff?

259
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:32,373
I get to frisk pretty things like you
and get paid for it.

260
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:36,460
Try and be more professional.
We got a crime suspect here.

261
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,046
You can't break into people's houses.

262
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:43,509
I didn't break in.
I used a key. My key.

263
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:48,681
It still ain't your house.
I'll have to escort you out.

264
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,308
Use the cuffs.

265
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:53,728
If you get him to sign these,
you can run me out of town.

266
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:57,189
- That's not your concern.
- What do we got here?

267
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,403
A bill of divorcement?

268
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:05,865
- You said you took care of this.
- I thought I had.

269
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:07,325
Obviously not.

270
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,910
If you are still married,
it's her house too.

271
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,830
This ain't nothing
but a domestic dispute.

272
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,041
He didn't hit you, did he?

273
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,126
If he did, I'll take him in.

274
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,838
We take that stuff
pretty serious nowadays.

275
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,844
No, Wade. Jake's never hit me.

276
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,097
You know what?

277
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:33,476
Every childhood memory I have
has you two in it.

278
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,145
Including the night
I lit my ass on fire.

279
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,815
Wade, Memory Lane is closed.

280
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:46,113
You two got a whole lot of catching
up to do. I'll leave you to it.

281
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:49,116
- I set you up with your wife.
- Sign the papers!

282
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:52,161
I can't do anything.
The law is the law.

283
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,497
She has done nothing wrong.

284
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:58,501
So shoplifting steaks
at Winn-Dixie is OK?

285
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,046
You know I took them back!

286
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:05,424
That vandalism at the stockyard?
Totally her.

287
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:08,594
Like I could tip a cow by myself.

288
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:12,640
Wade, isn't there
some outstanding warrant

289
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:16,769
for whoever dumped your
momma's tractor in the fish pond?

290
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,735
I have ten of these, then it's gone.

291
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:28,989
So if you are loving this monster...
How many?

292
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:31,450
Eight? We have eight only?

293
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,286
If I could say that in Italian,
I would.

294
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:40,668
9: 1 5? Honestly!
Who could be calling at this hour?

295
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:44,797
Hello? Hello?

296
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,799
Hey, Momma.

297
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:50,970
Melanie, is that you?
It's so late. Are you alright?

298
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,596
I ...

299
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,142
I thought I'd surprise you.

300
00:23:56,601 --> 00:24:00,688
This certainly is a surprise,
hearing from you,

301
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:03,107
you being such a busy girl an' all.

302
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:07,027
I call people while I'm doing
the dishes or shelling peas.

303
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:10,156
- Oprah calls it multitasking.
- Momma,

304
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:14,034
the call isn't the surprise.
I'm in town.

305
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,036
Lord love a duck!

306
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:21,500
My baby girl has finally come home.
Earl, she's in town.

307
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:25,087
If you're gonna repeat everything
she says, get off my chair.

308
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,506
- Momma...
- I'm just sitting here.

309
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,300
What happened to the sound?

310
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,927
I turned it down
to hear the phone ring.

311
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,637
Are you clairvoyant now?

312
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:36,474
It was so loud,
I couldn't hear myself think.

313
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:39,059
I heard it
at Joe and Merlene's house.

314
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,520
- Hello?
- I only get three minutes.

315
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,190
You didn't need to call.
Just come on by.

316
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:49,862
Well, that's the thing. I was hoping
Daddy could come and get me.

317
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:57,077
So, what put you in jail this time?

318
00:24:57,287 --> 00:25:01,790
Jake and his big fat mouth.
It was just a misunderstanding.

319
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,001
Like that wedding I paid for.

320
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,462
I would hardly call that a wedding.

321
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,130
The boy was nervous.

322
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,509
He was still drunk
from the night before.

323
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:14,428
- Can you blame him?
- Yes, I can!

324
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:17,306
I went to the reception
with puke down my dress

325
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,892
while he slept it off
in the Travelodge.

326
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:24,980
- You're still siding with that...
- I'm not siding with anybody.

327
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,192
- The boy's changed.
- Can we not talk about Jake?

328
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:31,570
I know he's the son you never had
but I'm your daughter.

329
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,448
Maybe you want to know
what's new with me.

330
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,701
OK. Shoot.

331
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:40,913
I met somebody.

332
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:44,041
And he's quite a catch.

333
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:47,294
He's really a great guy.

334
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,923
And I'm happy. Really.

335
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:57,346
Come to Momma, sugar.

336
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:00,766
Hey, Momma.

337
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:06,605
Good land of the living,
you are skin and bones.

338
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:11,402
Don't I get a smile?
I know you got one in there.

339
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:14,154
Let's not let all the bought air out.

340
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:22,079
Well, are you hungry?

341
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:25,249
You want me to reheat
some chicken fried steak?

342
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:28,210
- No, I'm fine.
- Sweetie, you look tired

343
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:32,506
Are you tired? Maybe it's the way
you're wearing your hair now.

344
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:37,886
You've done a lot with the place.

345
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,805
Lord, listen to that accent.

346
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:44,101
Sit in my good chair. Your momma
got me this Christmas before last.

347
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,478
When you were supposed to visit me?

348
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:50,065
I told you time and time again,
it just didn't suit.

349
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:53,277
Let me get you those tickets.

350
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:57,698
Sit down in it. Sit down.

351
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,244
Now watch this.

352
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:08,292
I mean, isn't that quite the deal?

353
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,962
There are hardly words.
How do I get out?

354
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:16,133
Oh, my God!

355
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:20,095
Jake tell you he's thinking
of getting one?

356
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:23,724
I see your priorities.
Jake, jail and then home.

357
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:26,393
It was just unfinished business.

358
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:29,313
Jake's doing alright.
Boy's going places.

359
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:32,316
Once upon a time
you were going places too.

360
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,193
Here are your tickets.

361
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:38,822
These were a gift.
I'd rather you guys just use them.

362
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:47,581
I don't understand how you visit
every stupid battlefield in the US

363
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,376
but you can't manage
to visit your daughter.

364
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:52,461
The door swings both ways.

365
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,631
Don't get me started
on things I don't understand.

366
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,965
Here we go.

367
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,677
You wanted me to get away
and be somebody.

368
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:02,096
You shoved me in beauty pageants.

369
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:06,058
- I'm just saying, is all.
- What are you trying to say?

370
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,435
Tell me what I can do
to make you happy.

371
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:12,815
- Just make yourself happy.
- Done. We're there, alright?

372
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:16,151
I've made something of myself.
I have a career.

373
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,653
People want to be me.

374
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,989
And somebody loves me
and I love him.

375
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:31,333
Pearl, get us some of that
baloney cake out of the icebox.

376
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,800
Your momma's a complex woman.

377
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,302
I'm going to bed.

378
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,766
Goodnight, darling.

379
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,523
You know nothing about her.

380
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,734
Are you even sure who she is?

381
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,152
I love her, Mom.

382
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:01,572
That's nice. But be careful.
You and I are different.

383
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:04,366
Not better, not worse,
just different.

384
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:09,204
We're in public life to serve,
so we have to set good examples.

385
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,998
Must you control everything?

386
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:15,377
Tell her I reserved the Plaza
for the second weekend in June.

387
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,255
We were thinking Christmas
in Ireland.

388
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:24,595
I won't let some girl
talk you into getting married. . .

389
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:29,308
She is not "some girl".
She's my fiancée, for Christ's sake.

390
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,605
You are just like your father.

391
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:39,651
One minute, you're brilliant,
controlled, steadfast.

392
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:43,322
The next, you're throwing it away
on some piece of ass.

393
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,328
Those are your issues, Mother,
not mine.

394
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,379
OK.

395
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:01,965
Hold on.

396
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:04,676
You know what?

397
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,971
How long does
a contested divorce take?

398
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,183
1 8 months?

399
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:16,104
Mr. Buford, I don't have 1 8 months.
I don't have 1 8 days.

400
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:18,857
That's just not going to work for me.

401
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,484
Yeah. Yes.

402
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:23,570
Don't see the likes of you
round these here parts.

403
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,364
Mr. Buford. . .

404
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:28,617
You look like sex on a stick.

405
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,494
I have to call you back.

406
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:33,247
Listen, why don't you just kiss my.. .

407
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,667
. .ass! Oh, my God.

408
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:40,921
Get in the truck cos I don't do
that sort of thing on the street.

409
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,341
Your momma raised you right.

410
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:47,594
What is that, Calvin Klein?
Very nice.

411
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:50,889
Very good. I better back off.

412
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:54,142
I don't want to get you in trouble
with the little lady.

413
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,061
There is a little lady?

414
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:59,565
I can't afford me, much less
some high-maintenance babe.

415
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:03,068
What about Cindy? You were hot
and heavy in high school.

416
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:06,613
She's a women's softball coach
in Nashville.

417
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,493
That explains some questions I had

418
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,954
about a game of post office
we played.

419
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,789
No!

420
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:20,752
I guess we all have our secrets,
Bobby Ray.

421
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,714
Yeah, we sure do.

422
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:28,093
But I read about yours
on the internet.

423
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,428
What?

424
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:32,014
I know about the cocks
in your henhouse.

425
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:36,727
God! Bobby Ray! You sure know
how to make a girl blush.

426
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:39,313
I gotta get back.
Are you in town for a while?

427
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:42,524
I hope not.
I'm just hitting the bank.

428
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,611
- I better scram.
- Very funny.

429
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:49,031
- It was good to see you.
- Good to see you, too. Bye.

430
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:54,912
Hi, Eugene.

431
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:56,788
How's your leg?

432
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:59,833
It don't give me too much trouble,
Miss Melanie.

433
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:03,462
Dorothea, I'm going to take my lunch.

434
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:10,969
Look what the cat dragged in.

435
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:15,891
Dorothea? My God, you've. . .

436
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,143
. .lost 1 1 0lbs, I know.

437
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,814
Well, congratulations.

438
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,524
Thanks.

439
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,777
You don't have an ATM.

440
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:29,029
Them things. Russ won't get one

441
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:32,824
because you lose personal contact
with customers.

442
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,285
Yes. That would be tragic.

443
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:40,832
Wade said you and Jake
had quite the reunion.

444
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,001
But that's just pillow talk.

445
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:48,131
- Are you and Wade...?
- Going on three years.

446
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:53,595
It ain't Tiffany's. But then
you can't believe everything on TV.

447
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,014
I need a withdrawal from my. . .

448
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:59,601
- . .joint account?
- My what?

449
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,270
Your joint account. With Jake.

450
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:05,899
From what I hear,
y'all are still married.

451
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:10,112
Why, yes.

452
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,615
Yes, we are.

453
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,119
Hi, honey.

454
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:02,956
Looking good. How's the family?

455
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,753
Cut the shit. Where's my stuff?

456
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:11,548
What kind of wife
doesn't pick up after her husband?

457
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:15,469
The kind that don't live here.

458
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:20,098
I'm going to ask you one last time.
Where is the hide-a-key?

459
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:24,478
I had the sweetest chat
with Wade's mom about her tractor.

460
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,648
Nice to see you got your accent back.

461
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:32,194
I stumbled across a few things today.

462
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:35,572
Holy shit!
What happened to the stove?

463
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:40,952
And where are them magnets
I had over here?

464
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:47,459
What the hell is this? Chick food?

465
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:51,171
Lite beer. Less calories.

466
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:56,176
I tried to get a new bed but have
you been to the Sit 'n Sleep lately?

467
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:58,970
I'll have to order something
from New York.

468
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,431
Whatever blows your dress up,
darlin'.

469
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,433
Go ahead and spend your money.

470
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:08,814
But, darlin', I thought you said
we should think of it as our money.

471
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:16,530
Just a guess but I think the words

472
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:20,575
"joint chequing" are flashing
in your head right now.

473
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:30,627
- How much did you take?
- All of it.

474
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,295
Son of a bitch!

475
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:35,173
You want a wife, you got a wife!

476
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,302
Why do you have all that cash?
Why don't you invest it?

477
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:40,971
If you don't get out. . .

478
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,348
Sign the papers
and I'll give it back.

479
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,599
- Fine!
- Fine.

480
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,144
Give me the pen.

481
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:50,480
- Why do you have all that cash?
- Give me the pen.

482
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:55,026
When did you quit the tyre factory?
Are you doing anything illegal?

483
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:58,280
Maybe I am. So?
I don't ask about your boyfriend.

484
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,907
Keep your nose out of my life. Deal?

485
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:06,371
Who told you?

486
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:10,625
Honey, just cos I talk slow
doesn't mean I'm stupid.

487
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:19,926
Look, Jake. . .

488
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:24,139
Nobody finds their soul mate
when they're ten years old.

489
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:28,518
Yeah, I guess.

490
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:32,272
I mean, where's the fun in that,
right?

491
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:50,498
I can't believe
you kept this all these years.

492
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,378
Most people don't know
lightning does that to sand.

493
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:59,174
Mel, you know what?

494
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:03,553
I just remembered
I got myself a hot date.

495
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,805
Mind if my lawyer looks at these?

496
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,766
- What?
- Hell.

497
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:10,602
I'm just a simple country boy.

498
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:13,855
There's words in there
I can't even pronounce.

499
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,524
You might be taking me
to the cleaner's.

500
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:20,320
- The cleaner's? You?
- What'd this set you back?

501
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:23,990
More than you make in a month.
Sign the damn papers!

502
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,746
Nah, but thanks for stopping by.

503
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:00,777
- I love you, I love you, I love you.
- Are you sitting down?

504
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,404
Why? Bad news?

505
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:05,573
I picked up New York magazine.
And I quote,

506
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,785
"That cool breath of fresh air
at Fashion Week

507
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:12,706
was the soon-to-be household name
of Melanie Carmichael."

508
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:16,209
"Fashion insiders
have labeled her the next big one."

509
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:21,006
Oh, my God! The next big one?

510
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:24,801
God, honey, I needed that
almost as much as I need you.

511
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,304
What is that noise?

512
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:31,266
- The sound of my past.
- Have fun.

513
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,059
OK, bye.

514
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,326
Batten down the hatches, boys!

515
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:54,873
Trouble just walked in, disguised
as my favourite daughter-in-law.

516
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:58,668
Drive that pretty face over here
and give me a hug.

517
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:01,171
Soon to be ex-daughter-in-law.

518
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:05,925
- Who's the lucky guy?
- His name is Andrew.

519
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:09,095
- He's in politics.
- He's got my vote.

520
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,556
Good to see you, baby girl.

521
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:16,353
Give this lady whatever she wants!
I'll catch up with you later.

522
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:23,735
I'll have a Grey Goose martini,
two olives, dirty.

523
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:30,450
Oh, my God! Melanie!

524
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:36,623
- Lurlynn?
- Yes! Oh, my God!

525
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:41,169
Look at you, all fancy,
like you stepped out of a magazine.

526
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:45,256
Well, thank you. Look at you.

527
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:48,259
You have a baby. In a bar.

528
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:50,387
Hell, I got three more at home.

529
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:54,307
This one's still on the tit,
so I can cart him anywhere.

530
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:55,558
Right.

531
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:58,853
I almost bought that exact same top
the other day.

532
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:04,359
But Clinton would kill me if I spent
30 bucks on a sweater thing.

533
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:08,530
That Jaclyn Smith
knows what she's doing.

534
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:12,575
Actually, it's mine.
Bergdorf just picked it up.

535
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,747
I design clothes now.

536
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:23,878
Now that you mention it,
I'm pretty sure I heard that.

537
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,172
So, do you know Jaclyn Smith?

538
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:33,096
Mind if I join you?

539
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:37,434
- Actually, we do.
- You must be Jake's hot date.

540
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:38,935
I'm Starr.

541
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:42,063
I'm Melanie, Jake's snotty
Yankee bitch wife,

542
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:45,525
whom he won't divorce,
even though I'm engaged.

543
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:48,570
Hot dog, Jake,
look at the size of that thing!

544
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:52,323
Honey, why don't you get us
a couple of drinks?

545
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,075
OK.

546
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,705
Is that a martini?

547
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:04,085
Not me and her "us", you and I "us".

548
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:15,513
Why do you make me
be mean to you?

549
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:19,350
Do you want to be humiliated
in front of all your friends?

550
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,520
Come on, Mel.
We were your friends too.

551
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:26,483
- Well, lookee, lookee, lookee.
- Hot damn!

552
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:30,987
Well, well, well. If it isn't
the two groomsmen of the apocalypse.

553
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:37,243
Hey, Eldon. Are you hungry?

554
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:39,162
I'm starving, Clinton.

555
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:41,122
No, don't you dare!

556
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,583
I could use a Melanie sandwich!

557
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:47,170
- Just like old times.
- Get your hands off me!

558
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:53,468
No! Not like old times, alright?
Times have changed.

559
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:56,971
No more Melanie sandwich,
no more Melanie taco,

560
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,890
and no more Melanie corndog.

561
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:01,017
- Sure.
- We're just playing.

562
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:03,269
Guys, let's play some pool.

563
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:06,773
You can't find a cue,
just pull the one shoved up her ass.

564
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:17,200
I can't believe you still wear
that same stupid hat.

565
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:20,537
Well, I just about got it broken in.

566
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:22,497
Now, sit your bony ass down

567
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:26,334
and watch me teach Jake here
how to lose at pool.

568
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,420
That's the thing.

569
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:33,800
I'm not really a watch-and-see
kind of girl, am I, Jake?

570
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:45,436
Come on, Bobby Ray, you got it.

571
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,356
Bobby Ray. . .

572
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:55,905
Don't blow this one, OK?
Alright, baby?

573
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:58,491
You can take the girl
out of the honky tonk

574
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:01,869
but you can't take
the honky tonk out of the girl.

575
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:08,918
So, Jake are you going
to divorce this girl or what?

576
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:12,714
Well, she waited seven years.

577
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:17,051
A couple more days won't kill her.
Unfortunately.

578
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,847
- Like it'll make a difference.
- You never know.

579
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:23,558
You might be interested
to know that Jake...

580
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:26,394
Let her think what she wants.

581
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,355
She made up her mind about me
a long time ago.

582
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,190
Some things never change.

583
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,485
Like Eldon here.

584
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:37,655
He never could get his balls
in the right pocket.

585
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:42,243
OK, Jake. It's you and Mel.

586
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:45,246
Clutch time.
Just like state playoffs.

587
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,582
We're down by six.
Seven seconds to go.

588
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:50,752
We need that beautiful 52-yard bomb!

589
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:58,092
- Remember that, Mel?
- How could I forget?

590
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,970
That was the night
Jake got me pregnant.

591
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:04,974
Why don't you just go public
with that shit?

592
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:09,729
Come on. It's not like
anybody can keep a secret here.

593
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:14,484
- Except for Bobby Ray.
- Now, what did I ever do to you?

594
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:20,031
You never did anything to me,
darling. Or any other girl in town.

595
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,659
Melanie, what is wrong with you?

596
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:25,370
- What do you mean?
- She's just unhappy.

597
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:29,582
I would be too if Women's Wear
Daily called me "less than mediocre".

598
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:35,630
Why don't you go to a gay bar?

599
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:42,261
Now what would B Ray do
in a gay bar?

600
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:54,732
Well. . .

601
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:59,529
I've had enough fun for one night.

602
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:03,741
Come on, I was just kidding.

603
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:09,497
Stella! How about another round
of drinks for my friends here?

604
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,416
Honey, you've had enough.

605
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:18,089
You know what? I think you're right.

606
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:21,426
I have had enough.

607
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:25,138
I mean, how do you people
live like this?

608
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:27,140
That's it, that's it.

609
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:30,059
Did you know
there's a world out there

610
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:34,814
that has nothing to do
with chitlins and children or beer?

611
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:37,650
I liked her better
when she was crazy.

612
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:38,901
Jake.

613
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:42,613
Why do you treat them
like something you stepped in?

614
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:45,283
- You asked for it!
- I asked for it?

615
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:47,285
You show up, steal my money

616
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:51,330
then insult my friends,
acting like you're better than them!

617
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:55,501
I am better than them!
And you stole my pen.

618
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,212
- That's all that matters to you.
- Thank you.

619
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:01,466
The money, the labels, the shoes.
You're pathetic!

620
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:05,136
Like you're going places.
I am, as soon as I get my keys.

621
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:08,139
- No, you don't.
- Give me my purse!

622
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:11,726
You want to kill yourself,
you do it somewhere else. There.

623
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:15,521
At least I'm doing something.
So what if you can't play football?

624
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:18,524
- Get a new dream. I did.
- Get in the truck now.

625
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:20,109
Alright!

626
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:29,118
I guess the date's over?

627
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:32,663
Do me a favour. Follow us home.

628
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,594
Evening, Earl.

629
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,471
Evening, Jake.

630
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:51,516
- Pearl.
- Jake.

631
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:45,695
Listen, Pearl, go easy on her.
We don't want another seven years.

632
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,868
We were wondering
when we'd see you.

633
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:58,708
Christ Almighty, Daddy, how will I
explain you in New York City?

634
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:03,796
History's history.
No use sweeping it under the rug.

635
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,511
- Wish me luck.
- Go get them Yankees.

636
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:15,391
People need a passport
to come down here.

637
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:37,788
Bryant, where is he?

638
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,674
Come here. Come on.

639
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:54,388
Come on. Bryant, come on.

640
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:57,516
What's she doing here?

641
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:01,020
I thought you'd be gone.

642
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:04,148
I put the money back.

643
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:12,281
Thanks. Saves me
from bouncing a lot of cheques.

644
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:16,118
Can he swim?

645
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:18,579
Doesn't look like it.

646
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:22,792
I like what you did, though.

647
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:26,337
To the house.
Should help it sell quicker.

648
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:27,838
Are you moving?

649
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:34,345
Well, I've been spending
a lot of my time in Tuscaloosa, so...

650
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:40,142
- How deep is that water?
- About eight feet.

651
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,235
Look, Mel, I signed your papers.

652
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:56,075
I never meant to hurt you
or anybody else for that matter.

653
00:49:56,994 --> 00:50:00,955
I just came out here
to say thank you.

654
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:07,086
You might want
to move out of the way.

655
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:10,423
You can't just leave!

656
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:14,135
Sure I can.

657
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:18,931
- You want to come?
- Where are you going?

658
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:27,064
I want to show you something.

659
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:33,821
- I can't.
- Can't or won't?

660
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:36,532
Both.

661
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:39,160
The girl I knew used to be fearless.

662
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:41,871
The girl you knew didn't have a life.

663
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:47,418
You better get on with it then.
Come on, Bryant.

664
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:51,547
Come on, boy, get in here.

665
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,690
Do you know
Bobby Ray Bailey's address?

666
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,942
81 3 Lafayette.

667
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,363
You don't remember me.

668
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:22,161
I remember you just fine. You used
to steal catfish from my pond.

669
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:27,249
Yes, sir. I did that.

670
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,002
I'm sorry.

671
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:36,217
On weekends, Bobby Ray
goes to the Carmichael plantation.

672
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:39,845
Visits with Colonel Murphy,
it being tourist season.

673
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:41,430
Thank you.

674
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:57,655
- Yes?
- Hi. I'm Melanie Carmi. . .

675
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:02,284
Melanie Smooter.

676
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:04,537
I'm here to see Bobby Ray.

677
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:10,209
If he's alive, he's out back.
Come on.

678
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:15,422
They're out here somewhere.
Watch your step.

679
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,806
Bobby Ray?

680
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:26,517
Melanie?
Don't move!

681
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:36,152
Hot damn!

682
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:38,821
Hold your fire, sir.

683
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:47,246
We weren't aiming for you but I
doubt I'd have gone to your funeral.

684
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:52,877
I guess I wouldn't blame you.

685
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:00,885
I'd forgotten how beautiful
this place was.

686
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:04,889
It doesn't take much
to forget things, does it?

687
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:09,226
- Bobby Ray, it's not like that.
- I'll tell you what it's not like.

688
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:12,730
It's not like Jake's the only one
you run out on.

689
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:17,359
I'm so sorry I outed you.

690
00:53:19,654 --> 00:53:22,781
I guess I figured
if I was pointing at you then.. .

691
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:26,118
. .nobody would see through me.

692
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:28,871
Bobby Ray!

693
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,497
I can't find the fuse!

694
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,714
I should go before he kills himself.

695
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:48,015
Bye.

696
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:01,779
Afternoon.

697
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:03,447
Can I help you?

698
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,658
Barry Lowenstein, New York Post.

699
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:09,536
Oh, boy. Am I glad to see you.

700
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:15,167
I'll tell you, it's definitely
another world down here.

701
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:17,419
- Did you say the Post?
- Yes.

702
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:20,422
I was hoping to interview you
and your family.

703
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:23,133
Maybe a few pictures,
if you don't mind.

704
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:28,514
No. I mean, yes, I do. Mind.
They're not here.

705
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,726
This is just as you described it.

706
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:36,021
It must have been amazing
growing up here.

707
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:38,482
Like a fantasy.

708
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:43,737
- Could I take a quick look inside?
- I'm on my way out.

709
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:48,659
- I'll come back then.
- OK, but just a peek.

710
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:53,205
This is it. Home, sweet home.

711
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,793
How old is this place?

712
00:54:58,003 --> 00:55:02,089
It was built
by my great-great-great-grandfather.

713
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:04,174
Charles Carmichael, in 1 853.

714
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:08,512
Boy. I bet you slid down
this bannister a time or two.

715
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:13,058
And over here, we have the...

716
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:19,148
. .kitchen. But who hasn't seen
one of those? Over here.

717
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:36,040
This is my favourite room.

718
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:40,711
It was part of the...
Underground Railroad.

719
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:43,213
Why are we whispering?

720
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:46,508
The whole place is haunted.

721
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:48,761
By ghosts of...

722
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:51,889
. .Civil War soldiers.

723
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:06,195
Dang Confederate buttons!

724
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:09,948
No wonder we lost the war.

725
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:14,328
Was that one of them?

726
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:17,206
Melanie?

727
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:22,419
- What are you doing in the closet?
- Barry Lowenstein, New York Post.

728
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:25,714
Miss Carmichael was showing me
around the plantation.

729
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:31,595
Mr Lowenstein is writing a piece
on the family,

730
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:34,556
since I'm marrying the mayor's son
and all.

731
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:37,226
I had no idea. Isn't that something?

732
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:40,145
Yeah.

733
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:45,818
A plantation by any other name
is just a farm.

734
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:49,113
But it does roll off the tongue
a little sweeter.

735
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:54,493
Miss Melanie forgot her manners.
I'm Bobby Ray.

736
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:56,078
Her cousin.

737
00:56:58,665 --> 00:56:59,706
Charmed.

738
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:07,631
The Yankees tried to destroy
our metal-forming capabilities

739
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:11,176
by placing barrels of powder
underneath the anvils.

740
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:15,139
All they managed to do was blow 'em
sky-high for a few seconds.

741
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:21,311
In honour of that act of stupidity,
we recreate it for the tourists.

742
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,991
What the hell was that?

743
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,242
Grandpa!

744
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:40,080
This here's Barry. He's doing
an article on Melanie's wedding.

745
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:43,167
Never heard of her!

746
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:53,427
Thanks!

747
00:57:57,891 --> 00:58:01,018
Well, aren't you just a big fat liar?

748
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:05,147
- Bobby Ray!
- Oh, go back to New York.

749
00:58:58,117 --> 00:58:59,993
I'm sorry about what I said.

750
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:03,747
- Really sorry.
- Oh, well.. . Forget it.

751
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:11,296
OK, y'all. You need to eat and be
quiet. We're gonna have us a visit.

752
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:28,814
You know, he went up there.

753
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,069
Who? Jake? When?

754
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:37,823
About a year after you left.

755
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:40,993
He don't know I know.
But Clinton let it slip once.

756
00:59:41,202 --> 00:59:44,538
- Jake was in New York?
- He'd never seen anything like it.

757
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:50,919
He realised straight off he'd need
more than an apology to win you back.

758
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:56,174
He needed to conquer the world first.
He's been trying ever since.

759
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:59,303
That's why he kept sending
the papers back.

760
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:01,263
Yeah.

761
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:06,393
It's funny how things don't work out.

762
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:10,480
It's funny how they do.

763
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:57,069
Look who I found by the parking lot,
hesitant to join us.

764
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:03,659
Anybody think of anything in here
that might bother Bobby Ray?

765
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,535
Clinton's breath?

766
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:12,250
- You still the same Bobby Ray?
- Last time I checked, yeah.

767
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:15,671
Well, then, let me buy you a drink.

768
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:18,340
You're really not my type.

769
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:28,350
Honey, you drink that from the top.

770
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:31,895
I'm just looking to see
who makes this Deep South Glass.

771
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:35,190
I wonder if you can get it
in New York. It's beautiful.

772
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,858
Jake!

773
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:41,738
Mel wants to know where she can find
some of that snooty-falooty glass.

774
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:44,533
- Why ask me?
- I don't know.

775
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:46,576
Maybe because you're. . .

776
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:50,372
You're all spiffed up and all.

777
01:01:50,581 --> 01:01:52,624
Am I missing something?

778
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:55,377
Let's show some respect, folks.

779
01:02:05,346 --> 01:02:09,307
Jake, when was the last time you
pushed me around the dance floor?

780
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:11,435
Clinton has got two left feet.

781
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:15,147
Well, Miss Taylor, I'd be honoured.
Let's do it.

782
01:02:15,356 --> 01:02:17,190
Come on, Mel! Get out here!

783
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,277
Aren't you the Lord of the Dance?

784
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:25,407
I ain't as clumsy as I look.
She just can't keep time.

785
01:02:25,616 --> 01:02:27,659
You might have to prove that to me.

786
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:45,343
He's pretty good. It might be you.

787
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:48,096
The hell you say! Let me at him.

788
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:54,686
Look at them two, welded together.

789
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:58,023
Why do they fight it?

790
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:04,237
Maybe we could just talk.

791
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:26,760
Come on. Let's go to the roadhouse.

792
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:28,136
Nah.

793
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:31,431
Let's drive to Fairview
and bowl a few frames.

794
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:36,311
- I don't think so.
- Want to go arrest somebody?

795
01:03:39,857 --> 01:03:42,442
- I know this great place where.. .
- No!

796
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:52,619
Y'all, I think I'm gonna
call it a night.

797
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:33,660
Hey there, boy.

798
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:36,454
Sorry it took me so long.

799
01:04:37,331 --> 01:04:40,458
I'd have come sooner
if I'd known you were sick.

800
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:47,716
Actually, that's probably not true.

801
01:04:50,761 --> 01:04:53,263
I've been pretty selfish lately.

802
01:04:55,641 --> 01:04:58,768
Dogs don't know anything about that,
do they, though?

803
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:05,150
You were always like
a big old pillow.

804
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:11,823
When everything went pear-shaped...

805
01:05:15,786 --> 01:05:18,288
. .you never left my side.

806
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:26,838
And then I just left you.

807
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:37,891
I bet you sat there
wondering what you'd done wrong.

808
01:05:43,022 --> 01:05:45,732
I told him it was my fault.

809
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:54,449
- Quit being so nice.
- It's the truth.

810
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:57,410
Why does it have to be
so complicated?

811
01:05:57,620 --> 01:06:00,163
- What?
- The truth.

812
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:04,084
Life.

813
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:06,544
This.

814
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:11,007
He was one hell of a good dog.

815
01:06:12,885 --> 01:06:14,344
Yeah.

816
01:06:16,055 --> 01:06:18,765
You looked like
you were having fun tonight.

817
01:06:21,894 --> 01:06:23,979
I'm happy in New York, Jake.

818
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:32,654
But then I come down here
and this fits too.

819
01:06:32,863 --> 01:06:36,199
Since when does it have to be
one or the other?

820
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:38,660
You can have roots and wings, Mel.

821
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:43,832
Maybe I can just fly south
for the winter.

822
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:49,421
Look.

823
01:06:50,047 --> 01:06:53,591
- What?
- There. Can you see 'em?

824
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:01,641
Lightning bugs. Only you.

825
01:07:04,645 --> 01:07:07,147
You know,
I still go out there sometimes.

826
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,527
I see those big thunderheads
rolling in.. .

827
01:07:14,238 --> 01:07:16,614
It's like a religion.

828
01:07:17,908 --> 01:07:20,201
I had a dream about it
the other night.

829
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:28,334
Ever wonder what would have
happened if we hadn't got pregnant?

830
01:07:28,544 --> 01:07:33,298
- Jake...
- Let me get this out before I can't.

831
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:39,387
I thought that baby
would be an adventure.

832
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:44,142
It took me a while to realise it
would have been your only adventure.

833
01:07:46,604 --> 01:07:48,897
I just guess
Mother Nature knew better.

834
01:07:50,941 --> 01:07:53,026
I was so ashamed.

835
01:07:56,781 --> 01:07:58,865
Cos I felt...

836
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:03,036
. .relieved.

837
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:10,710
And all of a sudden,
I just needed a different life.

838
01:08:14,381 --> 01:08:16,883
And you've done real well
for yourself.

839
01:08:18,803 --> 01:08:20,887
I'm proud of you, Mel.

840
01:08:23,891 --> 01:08:27,435
I'm just sorry I never danced
with you at our wedding.

841
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:34,359
I'm sure this next one
will go better for you.

842
01:08:40,324 --> 01:08:41,783
Jake, I can't do this.

843
01:08:47,873 --> 01:08:49,332
I know.

844
01:09:16,527 --> 01:09:18,236
Go home.

845
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:37,005
I'm just saying, is all.
I saw you two looking at each other.

846
01:09:37,214 --> 01:09:42,051
Momma, I can't help how Jake feels
about me. He's done nothing wrong.

847
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:45,889
- He's done nothing right either.
- Why are we having this argument?

848
01:09:46,098 --> 01:09:49,350
I'm leaving.
I'm marrying another man.

849
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:53,813
That's right, young lady. You get
a second chance, so don't mess it up.

850
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:58,193
- For whom? For me or for you?
- Don't sass me, OK?

851
01:09:58,402 --> 01:10:02,739
Don't you dare. I have put up with
an awful lot from you over the years.

852
01:10:02,948 --> 01:10:05,825
What? Like me quitting
your precious pageants?

853
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:09,329
I didn't want you to end up like me!
Damn it!

854
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:14,417
You need to stay far away from here.
That boy is quicksand.

855
01:10:15,669 --> 01:10:17,837
What's so wrong with being you,
Momma?

856
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:22,133
I just think that you deserve better,
that's all.

857
01:10:23,802 --> 01:10:25,887
I know you do.

858
01:10:29,433 --> 01:10:31,392
You always have.

859
01:10:32,978 --> 01:10:35,063
I'll see you in New York, alright?

860
01:10:36,315 --> 01:10:38,524
You'll like it.

861
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:40,777
I promise.

862
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:47,158
Don't forget to say goodbye
to your daddy.

863
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:08,346
Daddy?

864
01:11:23,445 --> 01:11:25,238
Who you looking for, darling?

865
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:27,490
Earl Smooter.

866
01:11:28,659 --> 01:11:30,743
Fifth Regiment?

867
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:33,663
Anybody seen Earl Smooter?

868
01:11:33,872 --> 01:11:35,790
He's about to surrender!

869
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:37,875
Thank you!

870
01:11:45,884 --> 01:11:47,969
After you.

871
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:57,645
Good afternoon.

872
01:11:57,855 --> 01:12:01,649
- How are you?
- Good, thanks. Yourself?

873
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:03,818
No complaints.

874
01:12:04,028 --> 01:12:07,113
- This is a beautiful house.
- Sure.

875
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:11,451
You here to see Bobby Ray?

876
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:14,912
Actually, I'm hoping
to surprise Melanie.

877
01:12:15,122 --> 01:12:17,790
- Melanie?
- My fiancee.

878
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:21,544
You got the wrong house, don't you?

879
01:12:22,463 --> 01:12:25,465
This is the Carmichael place,
isn't it?

880
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:28,384
Are we talking about the same girl?

881
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:30,928
- Melanie Smooter?
- Melanie Carmichael.

882
01:12:31,138 --> 01:12:33,765
Well, that explains it.

883
01:12:33,974 --> 01:12:36,351
It sure does.

884
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:39,687
Andrew Hennings.

885
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:43,107
- Jake Perry.
- Nice meeting you, Jake.

886
01:12:55,829 --> 01:12:57,830
Hey, Jake.

887
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,957
What's going on?

888
01:13:00,959 --> 01:13:05,171
Oh, you know.
Just talking to Mel's fiance here.

889
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:07,673
Wondering if you might know
where she is.

890
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:09,550
Andrew Hennings. You must be...

891
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:13,888
I'm Bobby Ray, her. . . cousin?

892
01:13:15,432 --> 01:13:19,602
- I see you've met Jake, her. . .
- Her other cousin.

893
01:13:20,604 --> 01:13:23,189
Family. It's great to meet you both.

894
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:28,444
Melanie said something about visiting
her daddy up at the battlefield.

895
01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:29,695
Battlefield?

896
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:33,991
In the South, the minute the
Confederacy died, it became immortal.

897
01:13:35,035 --> 01:13:38,162
Come on.
I'll give you a ride up there.

898
01:13:38,372 --> 01:13:41,457
That's great, thank you.
Nice meeting you.

899
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:54,804
So, who's. . . Melanie Snooter?

900
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:58,808
- Local hero round here.
- Why's that?

901
01:13:59,017 --> 01:14:02,520
- She blew up the bank.
- And that made her a hero?

902
01:14:02,729 --> 01:14:06,858
Well, notorious, anyway. She was ten.

903
01:14:08,235 --> 01:14:12,405
Fortunately, nobody was hurt,
except maybe the cat.

904
01:14:13,490 --> 01:14:14,657
What cat?

905
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:17,326
The one with the dynamite
on its back.

906
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:21,414
- She blew up a cat?
- He was scheduled to die anyway.

907
01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:24,917
- From dynamite?
- The vet said it had cancer.

908
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:30,965
So Eldon thought it'd be put in a
chamber that sucks their lungs out.

909
01:14:31,175 --> 01:14:33,551
Mel couldn't bear
the thought of that.

910
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:36,762
She wanted something more humane.

911
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:38,181
Yeah, sure.

912
01:14:38,390 --> 01:14:41,184
They were blasting
by the new highway,

913
01:14:41,393 --> 01:14:46,022
so we took ol' Fuzz up there,
taped him up.

914
01:14:46,231 --> 01:14:49,650
We used about 30 feet of fuse,
just to be safe.

915
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:53,404
- Said our prayers and ran like hell.
- Of course.

916
01:14:53,614 --> 01:14:58,618
So there we were, sitting in Virgie's
diner, feeling pretty blue,

917
01:14:58,827 --> 01:15:03,414
when Mel sees that cat trotting down
the road, searching for Eldon.

918
01:15:04,708 --> 01:15:05,791
No shit.

919
01:15:06,001 --> 01:15:09,295
We'd have caught him
but once that fuse hit his tail,

920
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:10,838
he took off like a shot.

921
01:15:11,048 --> 01:15:12,423
And into the bank.

922
01:15:14,301 --> 01:15:17,136
He probably wriggled loose
from the explosive

923
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:22,225
cos people still see him,
scorched tail and all.

924
01:15:22,434 --> 01:15:24,268
He's a bit skittish round humans.

925
01:15:27,022 --> 01:15:30,358
- That's quite a story.
- She was quite a girl.

926
01:15:33,237 --> 01:15:35,321
Whatever happened to her?

927
01:15:36,615 --> 01:15:39,033
Oh, you know.. .

928
01:15:39,243 --> 01:15:43,371
Wound up pregnant, married
some loser right out of high school.

929
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:18,864
Surprised?

930
01:16:23,954 --> 01:16:27,415
- What are you doing here?
- I came to deliver your fiance.

931
01:16:27,624 --> 01:16:29,875
- I think she was talking to me.
- Jake...

932
01:16:30,085 --> 01:16:31,586
Must be exhausting.

933
01:16:31,795 --> 01:16:32,920
- What?
- What?

934
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:35,548
- Living a lie.
- What is he talking about?

935
01:16:37,509 --> 01:16:40,636
You and I are in love
with two different people.

936
01:16:46,476 --> 01:16:48,394
Is he a second cousin?

937
01:16:49,563 --> 01:16:52,398
- He's my husband.
- Your what?

938
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:55,026
- My ex-husband.
- You married your cousin?

939
01:16:55,235 --> 01:16:57,820
- I came to finalise my divorce.
- Jesus Christ!

940
01:16:58,030 --> 01:17:00,531
Hey, darling. I thought that was you.

941
01:17:03,368 --> 01:17:06,203
This must be your new someone.

942
01:17:06,413 --> 01:17:08,331
Earl Smooter. Glad to meet you.

943
01:17:12,169 --> 01:17:13,878
Melanie Smooter.

944
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:19,342
Andrew, wait! Wait!

945
01:17:22,346 --> 01:17:24,680
I just. .. Please!

946
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:26,849
Let me try and explain myself.

947
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:30,936
You don't understand.
This is not who I am any more.

948
01:17:31,146 --> 01:17:34,357
I don't know who you are
but I know one thing.

949
01:17:34,566 --> 01:17:38,486
There is a Lear jet in Mobile
and I am on it.

950
01:17:59,466 --> 01:18:03,010
I know you're thinking
I spoiled things good this time.

951
01:18:03,762 --> 01:18:08,974
Don't go accusing me of thinking.
I ain't doing anything of the sort.

952
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:13,062
Anyway, spoiled is in the eye
of the beholder.

953
01:18:14,648 --> 01:18:16,190
Like these plums.

954
01:18:17,484 --> 01:18:20,027
Some people might call them spoiled

955
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:24,907
but I think that
these almost ruined ones

956
01:18:25,117 --> 01:18:27,368
sometimes make the sweetest jam.

957
01:18:29,579 --> 01:18:31,664
Do you need any help?

958
01:18:34,501 --> 01:18:37,878
It was kind of fun seeing Daddy
up there surrendering.

959
01:18:38,088 --> 01:18:42,258
Yeah. He sure does have a flair
for the dramatic.

960
01:18:42,467 --> 01:18:45,553
You certainly don't get it
from my side of the family.

961
01:18:48,056 --> 01:18:52,476
Hey, y'all, look who I found
walking down 958.

962
01:18:52,686 --> 01:18:56,272
Hi.

963
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:01,861
I thought you'd be halfway
to New York by now.

964
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:04,947
So did I .

965
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:10,619
If I'd known company was coming,
I'd have put on the dog.

966
01:19:12,038 --> 01:19:14,123
This is my momma.

967
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:19,128
She makes the best jam
in three counties.

968
01:19:20,797 --> 01:19:23,090
And my dad. You already met him.

969
01:19:26,136 --> 01:19:31,682
And this is our home.
This is where I grew up.

970
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:35,519
It's a pleasure meeting you both.

971
01:19:35,729 --> 01:19:39,940
I'm Andrew Hennings,
Melanie's fiance.

972
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:44,695
Well, that is
if she'll still have me.

973
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:55,414
Look, Mel, I really don't care
what happened down here.

974
01:19:56,458 --> 01:20:00,294
So you have a past.
I mean, who doesn't?

975
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:11,430
What I need to know is if there is
a place for me in your future.

976
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:16,560
Good Lord,
that is the sweetest thing.

977
01:20:18,146 --> 01:20:19,814
Go on.

978
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:28,614
Hello, New York City.

979
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:31,534
Woman, what are you gassin' about?

980
01:20:31,743 --> 01:20:35,788
Well, sir, my mother happens to be
the mayor up there.

981
01:20:35,997 --> 01:20:40,376
And she'd like nothing better than
a big, snazzy New York wedding.

982
01:20:43,588 --> 01:20:47,466
Well. . .
I suppose I could take off work.

983
01:20:50,387 --> 01:20:51,428
Andrew, I. . .

984
01:20:51,638 --> 01:20:54,974
I was thinking maybe
we could have the wedding here.

985
01:20:57,727 --> 01:20:58,769
Here?

986
01:20:58,979 --> 01:21:01,230
In my hometown.

987
01:21:02,357 --> 01:21:04,358
If you're worried about the money. ..

988
01:21:04,568 --> 01:21:08,279
It's not about the money, Andrew.
Not down here.

989
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:16,745
A lot of people are expecting us
to get married in the city.

990
01:21:17,581 --> 01:21:21,125
But I think a nice quiet
country wedding is just the ticket.

991
01:21:23,128 --> 01:21:29,258
Earl, Pearl, if you folks could
take care of the rehearsal dinner,

992
01:21:29,467 --> 01:21:32,136
I'd really like to take care
of the rest.

993
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:34,763
I think we could cover that.

994
01:21:36,766 --> 01:21:41,353
Heck! How many times does
your only daughter get married?

995
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:48,235
Other than before.

996
01:21:49,696 --> 01:21:52,823
- Felony Melanie?
- She was never convicted.

997
01:21:53,867 --> 01:21:57,870
Which is worse, child cat-killer
or sons of the Confederacy?

998
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:00,789
What do you suggest I do?
Dump her for being poor?

999
01:22:00,999 --> 01:22:02,583
You're a Democrat, remember?

1000
01:22:02,792 --> 01:22:06,587
There's nothing wrong with being
poor. I get elected by poor people.

1001
01:22:06,796 --> 01:22:10,591
And I commend her
for making something of herself.

1002
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,760
I'm upset that she lied to you.

1003
01:22:12,969 --> 01:22:15,179
So what?
She was ashamed of her background.

1004
01:22:15,388 --> 01:22:18,223
Who isn't embarrassed
by their parents at some point?

1005
01:22:18,433 --> 01:22:21,018
I'll assume
that's a rhetorical question.

1006
01:22:21,227 --> 01:22:22,978
Assume away.

1007
01:22:25,982 --> 01:22:27,983
No one can change my mind
about this.

1008
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:30,235
Not you, not the media, not anyone.

1009
01:22:31,321 --> 01:22:33,530
Fine.

1010
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:36,408
But admit it. I was right.

1011
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:41,538
Yes, you were right. But she came
clean. Can we move on?

1012
01:22:41,748 --> 01:22:45,250
There is a wedding in your future,
whether you like it or not.

1013
01:22:47,045 --> 01:22:51,382
And how does Miss Alabama plan
to accommodate 500 people?

1014
01:22:51,591 --> 01:22:53,550
She has connections at the jail?

1015
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:58,639
There are several excellent choices.
The Travelodge, Days Inn, Motel 6

1016
01:22:58,848 --> 01:23:02,017
and the Golden Cherry Motel,
where we will be.

1017
01:23:02,227 --> 01:23:04,311
Laugh now. But if this gets out...

1018
01:23:04,521 --> 01:23:08,357
It won't.
The press expects the Plaza in June.

1019
01:23:30,171 --> 01:23:31,672
About your wedding.

1020
01:23:31,881 --> 01:23:35,718
This place is gorgeous
and we can control the security.

1021
01:23:35,927 --> 01:23:37,302
The Carmichael plantation?

1022
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:40,222
It did inspire your identity,
did it not?

1023
01:23:40,432 --> 01:23:44,435
- You thought of everything.
- I always do. Keep in touch.

1024
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:25,142
- You guys remember the sheik?
- Yeah.

1025
01:24:25,351 --> 01:24:28,854
He proposed and I think I loved him,
despite his billions.

1026
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:30,397
Why didn't you say yes?

1027
01:24:30,607 --> 01:24:36,528
I realised my head and my heart
were saying two different things.

1028
01:24:36,738 --> 01:24:38,405
It's a big decision.

1029
01:24:38,615 --> 01:24:41,116
It's supposed to be
the easiest one you make.

1030
01:24:41,326 --> 01:24:42,367
Wasn't it?

1031
01:24:45,246 --> 01:24:49,124
Tabby, this is it! This is the stuff
I was telling you about.

1032
01:24:49,334 --> 01:24:51,627
"Deep South Glass."

1033
01:24:52,587 --> 01:24:54,421
Oh, yes. Let's.

1034
01:25:13,024 --> 01:25:15,109
Oh, that's pretty.

1035
01:25:20,406 --> 01:25:22,199
What's the matter?

1036
01:25:22,408 --> 01:25:23,575
Oh, my God.

1037
01:25:26,371 --> 01:25:27,830
Do we know...

1038
01:25:29,082 --> 01:25:30,874
. .Mo?

1039
01:25:40,051 --> 01:25:41,510
Mel?

1040
01:26:08,538 --> 01:26:10,539
Look at these.

1041
01:26:10,748 --> 01:26:13,959
It's what happens to sand
when it struck by lightning.

1042
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:16,670
- She's pulling your dick.
- No, really.

1043
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:19,965
I've seen it.
You just have to dig it up.

1044
01:26:32,979 --> 01:26:35,230
- Hey, Bryant.
- Friend of yours?

1045
01:26:50,830 --> 01:26:52,748
I saw him first.

1046
01:26:52,957 --> 01:26:56,668
I think he's already taken.

1047
01:26:58,755 --> 01:27:03,634
I ... I tried to call you
a couple of times.

1048
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:10,599
You and your friends should
look around and have some lunch.

1049
01:27:10,808 --> 01:27:12,643
Sit on the deck. It's nice.

1050
01:27:14,354 --> 01:27:15,395
Jake.

1051
01:27:20,652 --> 01:27:23,070
Come on, Bryant. Let's. . .

1052
01:27:23,279 --> 01:27:25,322
Let's leave this lady alone.

1053
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:28,700
Come on.

1054
01:27:38,711 --> 01:27:40,170
Sir, can we help you?

1055
01:27:41,381 --> 01:27:44,508
I'm looking for a Melanie Carmichael.

1056
01:27:45,927 --> 01:27:48,428
Anybody here recognise that name?

1057
01:27:49,389 --> 01:27:53,350
- What business you got with her?
- I'm afraid that's a private matter.

1058
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:56,853
Then I'm afraid we can't help you.

1059
01:28:08,616 --> 01:28:09,992
Damn reporters.

1060
01:28:10,201 --> 01:28:12,661
It's like the first ant at a picnic.

1061
01:28:14,372 --> 01:28:18,542
Now. This one here
is from Louisiana.

1062
01:28:19,252 --> 01:28:21,253
It's got a little alligator on top.

1063
01:28:21,462 --> 01:28:25,299
How sweet. I can see
where your daughter gets her taste.

1064
01:28:31,222 --> 01:28:33,849
This is one of those disasters
waiting to happen.

1065
01:28:34,058 --> 01:28:36,768
One of the big ones
only cockroaches survive.

1066
01:28:36,978 --> 01:28:39,146
It's going to be fine.

1067
01:28:49,699 --> 01:28:52,117
One down, seven million to go.

1068
01:28:52,327 --> 01:28:55,412
Careful. You just smashed
the state bird of Alabama.

1069
01:28:57,832 --> 01:28:59,416
Pearl.

1070
01:28:59,625 --> 01:29:01,585
Well, finally.

1071
01:29:01,794 --> 01:29:05,547
Oh, my. Well, I can see
why Melanie is so adorable.

1072
01:29:05,757 --> 01:29:08,300
I'm so happy to be here. Hi, Earl.

1073
01:29:08,509 --> 01:29:11,094
We're so happy to have you here.

1074
01:29:11,304 --> 01:29:14,431
I'm sorry the place is such a mess,
Mrs Hennings. Mayor!

1075
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,600
No, no. It's Kate.

1076
01:29:16,809 --> 01:29:21,355
I've been trying to get Earl to weed
these shrubs and repaint the trim.. .

1077
01:29:21,564 --> 01:29:25,650
Oh, my God!
Look how pretty she is, Earl.

1078
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:29,863
- I'll bet Kate could use a drink.
- Kate could indeed.

1079
01:29:30,073 --> 01:29:35,035
Come right on then. I've got some
fried pickles, hot out of the grease.

1080
01:29:35,244 --> 01:29:36,286
Yum.

1081
01:29:40,583 --> 01:29:42,709
It's a lovely chair, Earl.

1082
01:29:42,919 --> 01:29:46,338
To get the full effect,
you pull this handle here.

1083
01:29:46,547 --> 01:29:47,756
Daddy, no!

1084
01:29:47,965 --> 01:29:49,758
Hold onto your drink, Kate.

1085
01:30:16,577 --> 01:30:19,204
- Name?
- Wallace Buford.

1086
01:30:19,414 --> 01:30:23,250
I'm not on that list but I've got
some urgent business with the bride.

1087
01:30:23,459 --> 01:30:26,002
Not today, you don't. Trooper.

1088
01:30:26,212 --> 01:30:30,006
- Sir, let's get it turned around.
- Let's go.

1089
01:30:54,323 --> 01:30:55,365
Hi.

1090
01:30:56,325 --> 01:31:00,454
- There's a wedding going on.
- I heard a mention of it.

1091
01:31:01,372 --> 01:31:03,999
I sure hope this weather cooperates.

1092
01:31:04,208 --> 01:31:07,085
It's supposed to be a big one.

1093
01:31:07,753 --> 01:31:10,005
You know, Jake,.. .

1094
01:31:11,007 --> 01:31:14,134
. .you're my only son and I love you.

1095
01:31:14,844 --> 01:31:20,056
But sometimes you are
too much like your daddy.

1096
01:31:21,726 --> 01:31:23,810
She made her decision.

1097
01:31:26,647 --> 01:31:30,525
For somebody who's been
holding onto something so hard,

1098
01:31:30,735 --> 01:31:32,777
you're pretty quick to let it go.

1099
01:31:35,907 --> 01:31:39,493
I can't control her any more
than I can control the weather.

1100
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:56,760
It's just nerves.
You're doing the right thing.

1101
01:31:58,221 --> 01:32:00,305
Am l?

1102
01:32:01,974 --> 01:32:07,521
When I married your daddy. . .
Lord, I was a fool for that man.

1103
01:32:07,730 --> 01:32:10,232
I couldn't put one foot
in front of the other.

1104
01:32:10,441 --> 01:32:15,612
I remember thinking, "Preacher,
hurry up before he changes his mind."

1105
01:32:16,989 --> 01:32:18,865
Look where it got me.

1106
01:32:19,784 --> 01:32:24,204
Sometimes that man makes me
so mad, I could wring his neck.

1107
01:32:24,413 --> 01:32:25,747
But you still love him?

1108
01:32:25,957 --> 01:32:30,085
God knows I do.
And only He knows why.

1109
01:32:32,004 --> 01:32:33,046
Momma...

1110
01:32:33,256 --> 01:32:37,050
He can give you a life
that we never dreamed of.

1111
01:32:38,135 --> 01:32:39,594
And he adores you.

1112
01:32:43,849 --> 01:32:45,308
He does, doesn't he?

1113
01:33:19,302 --> 01:33:22,762
Even if he is a Yankee,
at least he's sober.

1114
01:33:22,972 --> 01:33:24,264
Miss Carmichael!

1115
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:28,935
Get here! Get back here!

1116
01:33:35,026 --> 01:33:36,484
Mr Buford?

1117
01:33:36,694 --> 01:33:38,945
Get your hands off me!

1118
01:33:39,155 --> 01:33:40,822
Let him go!

1119
01:33:44,660 --> 01:33:46,244
Melanie?

1120
01:33:46,454 --> 01:33:49,456
You are one hard woman
to get in touch with.

1121
01:33:51,792 --> 01:33:55,670
Mr Buford, he signed the papers.
What are you doing here?

1122
01:34:01,886 --> 01:34:04,679
He did. You didn't.

1123
01:34:05,848 --> 01:34:07,891
What?

1124
01:34:13,105 --> 01:34:14,564
I'm still married?

1125
01:34:16,442 --> 01:34:19,110
Well, . . . only if you want to be.

1126
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:22,822
For God's sakes, Melanie,
I thought you took care of this.

1127
01:34:23,032 --> 01:34:24,532
It's an honest mistake.

1128
01:34:24,742 --> 01:34:27,327
Then can we fix it
before we all get soaked?

1129
01:34:28,537 --> 01:34:30,955
Does anybody have a pen?

1130
01:34:32,625 --> 01:34:34,668
- Mom?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

1131
01:34:36,796 --> 01:34:39,005
Darling?

1132
01:34:40,716 --> 01:34:43,093
These things don't just happen,
you know.

1133
01:34:45,471 --> 01:34:48,390
You can't ride two horses
with one ass, sugarbean.

1134
01:35:23,759 --> 01:35:24,801
Andrew?

1135
01:35:26,470 --> 01:35:29,848
- You don't want to marry me.
- I don't?

1136
01:35:30,057 --> 01:35:34,102
No. No, you don't.

1137
01:35:34,311 --> 01:35:36,146
Not really.

1138
01:35:39,692 --> 01:35:41,776
You see, the truth is. . .

1139
01:35:43,738 --> 01:35:45,822
. . I gave my heart away long ago.

1140
01:35:47,825 --> 01:35:49,701
My whole heart.

1141
01:35:49,910 --> 01:35:51,953
And I never really got it back.

1142
01:35:53,038 --> 01:35:58,793
I don't even know what else to say
but I'm sorry. I can't marry you.

1143
01:36:05,968 --> 01:36:08,052
And you shouldn't want to marry me.

1144
01:36:17,646 --> 01:36:19,939
So this is what this feels like.

1145
01:36:22,359 --> 01:36:24,569
That's it?

1146
01:36:24,779 --> 01:36:29,407
You're letting her humiliate you with
some bullshit about an old husband?

1147
01:36:42,463 --> 01:36:44,255
Yeah.

1148
01:36:51,138 --> 01:36:53,223
I think I am.

1149
01:36:59,605 --> 01:37:01,689
Excuse me.

1150
01:37:09,949 --> 01:37:11,324
You. . .

1151
01:37:11,534 --> 01:37:14,244
In my entire life,

1152
01:37:14,453 --> 01:37:19,249
I have never met anyone
so manipulative, so deceitful.

1153
01:37:20,417 --> 01:37:21,751
And I'm in politics!

1154
01:37:22,503 --> 01:37:23,878
I'm just being honest.

1155
01:37:24,088 --> 01:37:27,966
I will not allow the future president
of the United States

1156
01:37:28,175 --> 01:37:31,511
to be dumped at the altar
by some psycho Daisy May!

1157
01:37:32,304 --> 01:37:36,391
- You go after him, you little bitch!
- Wait. Just a minute, missy.

1158
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:38,726
There's no need for name calling.

1159
01:37:38,936 --> 01:37:42,438
She spoke her piece
and that's all there is to it.

1160
01:37:43,232 --> 01:37:47,277
Go back to your double wide
and fry something.

1161
01:37:57,162 --> 01:37:59,455
Nobody talks to my momma like that!

1162
01:37:59,665 --> 01:38:02,750
Praise the Lord!
The South has risen again!

1163
01:38:13,596 --> 01:38:17,056
Hey! Y'all! lf you're friends
of the bride, stick around!

1164
01:38:17,266 --> 01:38:19,309
I'm gonna go find me a groom!

1165
01:39:14,239 --> 01:39:15,281
Hey, cowboy!

1166
01:39:20,871 --> 01:39:22,664
You owe me a dance.

1167
01:39:23,666 --> 01:39:25,667
Nice dress.
Where's your husband?

1168
01:39:25,876 --> 01:39:27,877
I'm looking at him.

1169
01:39:30,172 --> 01:39:32,507
Apparently,
you and I are still hitched.

1170
01:39:33,676 --> 01:39:36,177
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

1171
01:39:37,471 --> 01:39:39,597
Why didn't you say
you came to New York?

1172
01:39:40,766 --> 01:39:43,851
- I had to make something of myself.
- You about done?

1173
01:39:45,312 --> 01:39:48,815
What is it about Southern girls?
Can't make the right decision

1174
01:39:49,024 --> 01:39:50,733
till you try all the wrong ones?

1175
01:39:50,943 --> 01:39:52,068
I fight for what I want!

1176
01:39:52,277 --> 01:39:53,778
What do you want?

1177
01:39:53,988 --> 01:39:56,197
I don't even think you know.

1178
01:39:56,407 --> 01:40:01,035
You're the first boy I ever kissed,
Jake. I want you to be the last.

1179
01:40:01,245 --> 01:40:03,830
Maybe you and I had our chance.

1180
01:40:06,083 --> 01:40:08,918
Fine!
Have it your way, you stubborn ass!

1181
01:40:12,589 --> 01:40:15,508
What do you want to be married
to me for anyhow?

1182
01:40:22,683 --> 01:40:24,976
So I can kiss you anytime I want.

1183
01:40:44,872 --> 01:40:49,042
What the hell are you two
trying to do? Get yourselves killed?

1184
01:40:50,294 --> 01:40:52,628
What seems to be the trouble,
Officer?

1185
01:40:52,838 --> 01:40:54,964
I'm here to bring you in, young lady.

1186
01:40:55,174 --> 01:40:57,133
What'd she do this time?

1187
01:40:57,342 --> 01:41:01,679
Well, the way I hear it, it seems
she ran out on a perfectly good cake!

1188
01:41:35,089 --> 01:41:36,255
Here we go.

1189
01:41:36,465 --> 01:41:40,176
Well, folks. Look who finally
made it to their reception.

1190
01:41:40,385 --> 01:41:43,846
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mrs and Mr Jake Perry!

1191
01:41:59,905 --> 01:42:02,365
You might want to keep those
for the honeymoon.

1192
01:42:06,829 --> 01:42:08,913
Speech!

1193
01:42:10,499 --> 01:42:14,043
Well, I do believe
I owe this lady a dance.

1194
01:42:14,253 --> 01:42:15,461
You sure do!

1195
01:42:22,261 --> 01:42:23,803
Shut up, Bryant!

1196
01:42:26,598 --> 01:42:28,683
Look at this.

1197
01:42:34,606 --> 01:42:35,648
Hey, Stella.

1198
01:42:37,943 --> 01:42:39,735
Make it a slow one.

1199
01:43:19,109 --> 01:43:21,194
Smile!

1200
01:44:14,498 --> 01:44:16,582
Alright, stand right here.

1201
01:44:21,463 --> 01:44:23,547
Alright. Stand real close!
