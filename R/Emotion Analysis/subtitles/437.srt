1
00:00:37,587 --> 00:00:39,797
This is the Persian empire...

2
00:00:40,048 --> 00:00:42,174
...known today as Iran.

3
00:00:43,093 --> 00:00:47,137
For 2500 years, this land was
ruled by a series of kings...

4
00:00:47,305 --> 00:00:48,848
...known as shahs.

5
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,520
In 1950, the people of Iran
elected Mohammad Mosaddegh...

6
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:57,064
...a secular democrat,
as prime minister.

7
00:00:58,316 --> 00:01:01,485
He nationalized British and
U.S. petroleum holdings...

8
00:01:01,653 --> 00:01:04,613
...returning Iran's oil to its people.

9
00:01:05,782 --> 00:01:07,575
But in 1953...

10
00:01:07,742 --> 00:01:12,371
...the U.S. and Great Britain engineered
a coup d'etat that deposed Mosaddegh...

11
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:15,541
...and installed Reza Pahlavi as shah.

12
00:01:16,835 --> 00:01:20,296
The young shah was known
for opulence and excess.

13
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:23,340
His wife was rumored to bathe in milk...

14
00:01:23,508 --> 00:01:27,428
...while the shah had his lunches
flown in by Concorde from Paris.

15
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:30,264
The people starved.

16
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:35,769
The shah kept power through
his ruthless internal police:

17
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:37,688
The SAVAK.

18
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:41,442
An era of torture and fear began.

19
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:47,114
He then began a campaign
to westernize Iran...

20
00:01:48,116 --> 00:01:51,911
...enraging a mostly
traditional Shiite population.

21
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:56,874
In 1979, the people of
Iran overthrew the shah.

22
00:01:58,835 --> 00:02:03,005
The exiled cleric, Ayatollah
Khomeini, returned to rule Iran.

23
00:02:06,217 --> 00:02:10,971
It descended into score-settling,
death squads and chaos.

24
00:02:14,225 --> 00:02:17,937
Dying of cancer, the shah
was given asylum in the U.S.

25
00:02:19,856 --> 00:02:23,525
The Iranian people took to the
streets outside the U.S. embassy...

26
00:02:23,693 --> 00:02:26,278
...demanding that the
shah be returned...

27
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:27,780
...tried...

28
00:02:28,698 --> 00:02:30,074
...and hanged.

29
00:02:30,241 --> 00:02:34,078
Based on a true story.

30
00:02:34,245 --> 00:02:38,123
U.S. Embassy, Iran
- November 4, 1979

31
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:42,271
The carnival's a little
bigger today, huh?

32
00:03:43,815 --> 00:03:46,734
Windows are supposed to
be bulletproof, right?

33
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:48,944
Well, they've never been tested.

34
00:03:49,154 --> 00:03:53,574
You just need to finish
filling out this section here.

35
00:03:53,742 --> 00:03:55,534
We can process your visa.

36
00:04:45,376 --> 00:04:48,921
We need some security. Yes,
it's your responsibility.

37
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:50,297
They're over the walls.

38
00:04:50,465 --> 00:04:53,217
We should all split. I'm
gonna close up my office.

39
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:14,196
Oh, my God.

40
00:05:15,156 --> 00:05:17,324
Marines to Number One. Fall back.

41
00:05:17,492 --> 00:05:18,909
Can anyone hear me?
We need help.

42
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,994
I need police right now.
Right now, goddamn it!

43
00:05:21,162 --> 00:05:22,830
- Jesus.
- Can anybody hear me?

44
00:05:22,997 --> 00:05:24,832
There was a breach.

45
00:05:26,251 --> 00:05:27,668
Just burn everything! Burn it now!

46
00:05:27,836 --> 00:05:30,587
All right, burn everything! All
the files, file cabinet, safe.

47
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,646
Let's get a cart over
here. Burn it all. Come on.

48
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:50,691
Burn everything! Burn the
classifieds! Everything!

49
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:56,905
Don't fucking shoot anybody.

50
00:05:57,073 --> 00:05:59,783
You don't wanna be the son
of a bitch who started a war.

51
00:05:59,951 --> 00:06:01,743
They need an hour to
burn the classified.

52
00:06:02,745 --> 00:06:03,787
I need you to hold.

53
00:06:03,955 --> 00:06:08,000
If you shoot one person, they're gonna
kill every single one of us in here.

54
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:19,887
I'm telling you, if we're
going to go, we need to go now.

55
00:06:20,054 --> 00:06:23,640
- Okay, we need to make a decision...
- Can we wait until the Iranian police come?

56
00:06:23,808 --> 00:06:26,268
No, the police aren't
coming. It's been 45 minutes.

57
00:06:26,436 --> 00:06:29,438
- How do you know?
- The police have abandoned their posts.

58
00:06:29,606 --> 00:06:31,840
If the police are not coming,
then the army's gonna come.

59
00:06:31,908 --> 00:06:34,443
The prime minister won't let
the embassy be taken over.

60
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:35,988
The prime minister may come tomorrow,

61
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:38,780
but the Komiteh are here today.
So we have to evacuate.

62
00:06:38,948 --> 00:06:41,033
Look at me. No one is coming.

63
00:06:42,493 --> 00:06:45,245
Get the desk drawers.
Everything. Don't sort it.

64
00:06:45,413 --> 00:06:47,748
Get it down to the incinerator
in the vault! Go, now!

65
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:49,833
Tear gas as a last resort only.

66
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:52,336
I repeat: only if your
life is under threat.

67
00:07:30,124 --> 00:07:32,918
In here, we are in America right
now. Outside, we are in Iran.

68
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:35,587
- It's on American soil...
- I'm not going out into that.

69
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:37,005
They're not safe here.

70
00:07:37,173 --> 00:07:40,133
If they get caught applying
for visas to the U.S.?

71
00:07:40,301 --> 00:07:43,220
Mark, we are in the only building
with direct access to the street.

72
00:07:43,388 --> 00:07:45,429
If we're going to go,
then we need to go now.

73
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,139
Yeah, I'm in.

74
00:07:46,307 --> 00:07:47,724
- Yeah.
- Yeah, let's go.

75
00:07:52,814 --> 00:07:54,856
- I'm going outside.
- Why?

76
00:07:55,024 --> 00:07:56,483
To reason with them.

77
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:26,221
Open the door!

78
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:28,098
Open the fucking door!

79
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,811
You said you wanted to
see the world, right, Tom?

80
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,063
Let me in! Let me in!

81
00:08:43,031 --> 00:08:44,531
Burn it all. Come on.

82
00:08:44,699 --> 00:08:47,451
Get the safe, get the
filing cabinets, get it all.

83
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,377
All four drawers, I want
them shredded right now.

84
00:08:57,545 --> 00:08:59,338
Not gonna shred fast enough.

85
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:02,049
Grab the visa plates!

86
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:05,677
All four! And anything
else you see out there.

87
00:09:05,887 --> 00:09:07,637
When in doubt, just shred it!

88
00:09:10,141 --> 00:09:12,768
We got 10 minutes! Let's go,
let's go, let's go! Everything!

89
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:23,320
Get the shredder.

90
00:09:23,488 --> 00:09:25,030
There are no police.

91
00:09:31,662 --> 00:09:32,871
Jesus.

92
00:09:33,915 --> 00:09:36,833
Leave the building, go now.

93
00:09:37,001 --> 00:09:39,086
Iranians go first.

94
00:09:39,253 --> 00:09:40,879
Now, hurry!

95
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:56,311
Who has made this?!

96
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,277
It's done. They're in.

97
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:32,931
Okay, come on. We gotta
get off the streets.

98
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:34,641
This way. Up here to the left.

99
00:11:03,909 --> 00:11:05,172
STATE DEPARTMENT
- 7TH FLOOR

100
00:11:05,173 --> 00:11:08,508
- These fucks hit us, we can't hit them back?
- Mosaddegh, we did it to them first.

101
00:11:08,676 --> 00:11:12,095
You think the Soviets would put
up with this shit? They'd invade.

102
00:11:12,263 --> 00:11:14,848
We helped the guy torture and
de-ball an entire population.

103
00:11:15,016 --> 00:11:17,225
- How many were there?
- At least 50. We're not sure.

104
00:11:17,393 --> 00:11:19,436
- Schafer!
- You still haven't found Schafer?

105
00:11:19,604 --> 00:11:21,480
No, I was screaming his name
because I was fucking him.

106
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:24,024
CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE, TEHRAN

107
00:11:24,025 --> 00:11:25,025
Come in.

108
00:11:25,193 --> 00:11:26,860
It's confirmed, sir. Six escaped.

109
00:11:27,028 --> 00:11:29,196
- I was told five.
- No, sir, apparently it's six.

110
00:11:29,363 --> 00:11:32,699
SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE - What
happened? - Not clear. We know they escaped.

111
00:11:32,867 --> 00:11:35,035
- Where are they?
- The Canadian ambassador's house.

112
00:11:35,203 --> 00:11:38,914
- Do they stay put? Are we attempting rescue?
- Hold for the Secretary of State.

113
00:11:39,081 --> 00:11:40,874
Yes. Is White House joining?

114
00:11:41,042 --> 00:11:42,626
They claim the embassy
was a den of espionage.

115
00:11:42,793 --> 00:11:44,252
- We wish it was.
- A fuckin' den of espionage.

116
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,668
WHITE HOUSE, CHIEF OF
STAFF'S OFFICE

117
00:11:45,669 --> 00:11:46,989
CI's got three people over there, they
don't see a revolution coming?

118
00:11:47,057 --> 00:11:50,091
- Call it something other than intelligence.
- Hold for the chief of staff.

119
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:51,885
- Hodding.
- I'll call him back.

120
00:11:52,053 --> 00:11:54,179
They're sticking. No release
till we expel the shah.

121
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:57,390
- Put him on a plane, then. Fuck him.
- He's half-dead and he's in chemo.

122
00:11:57,558 --> 00:11:58,975
We took him in. He's ours now.

123
00:11:59,143 --> 00:12:01,603
Great, so we'll take in any
prick as long as he's got cancer?

124
00:12:01,771 --> 00:12:03,313
No, just the pricks on our side.

125
00:12:03,481 --> 00:12:07,025
So all our other pricks on their prick thrones
know when they get thrown out on a rail...

126
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:10,362
...they won't get their fucking spleens
taken out by some camel vet in Sinai.

127
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,031
What about the six who
are with the Canadians?

128
00:12:13,449 --> 00:12:16,076
We've got 60 in the embassy with
guns to their heads right now.

129
00:12:16,244 --> 00:12:19,037
The whole world is watching the embassy.
They're safer than the six on the street.

130
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,373
Banisadr's saying it'll
be over in 24 hours.

131
00:12:24,961 --> 00:12:27,462
We leave the six where they
are. I'll go brief the president.

132
00:12:30,758 --> 00:12:31,883
All right, let's get to it.

133
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:35,554
So far official comments about the
incident have been a model of restraint.

134
00:12:44,355 --> 00:12:48,692
69 DAYS LATER

135
00:13:01,372 --> 00:13:04,249
Iran's Revolutionary Guard has
rounded up a gang of terrorists...

136
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:08,920
...blamed for one murder of a half-dozen
followers of Ayatollah Khomeini.

137
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:12,841
It says security at Khomeini's
home now has been tightened.

138
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:17,679
This, by the way, is the 69th day that the
American hostages have been held in Tehran.

139
00:13:17,847 --> 00:13:19,889
There is no change reported
in the hostage situation.

140
00:13:21,517 --> 00:13:24,853
In this country, George Meany died
last night. He was 85 years old.

141
00:13:26,897 --> 00:13:28,315
Yeah.

142
00:13:29,525 --> 00:13:30,984
Yes.

143
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:34,446
What?

144
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,615
To begin with, of course...

145
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:40,452
...we wanted to learn about the hostages
held in the American embassy compound.

146
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,997
They may not understand what their
ordeal means to their countrymen.

147
00:13:44,165 --> 00:13:46,458
But this nation, their
nation, is outraged.

148
00:13:47,168 --> 00:13:49,523
C.I.A. HEADQUARTERS, VIRGINIA

149
00:13:49,524 --> 00:13:52,088
And we cannot really know what it is like
inside the prison that was once our embassy.

150
00:13:52,506 --> 00:13:56,718
Actions of Iran have
shocked the civilized world.

151
00:13:57,219 --> 00:13:59,679
Our embassy has been seized...

152
00:13:59,847 --> 00:14:04,851
...and more than 60 American citizens
continue to be held as hostages.

153
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:09,022
The situation in Iran this morning is
unchanged in regard to the hostages.

154
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:12,400
NBC's situation in Iran
has changed, however.

155
00:14:16,238 --> 00:14:19,157
- Is he back there?
- Office.

156
00:14:23,537 --> 00:14:25,080
What happened?

157
00:14:25,456 --> 00:14:28,041
The six of them went out a back exit.

158
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:30,710
Brits turned them away,
Kiwis turned them away.

159
00:14:30,878 --> 00:14:32,587
Canadians took them in.

160
00:14:32,755 --> 00:14:34,798
Traffic calls them "The Houseguests. "

161
00:14:34,965 --> 00:14:38,093
They haven't left the Canadian
ambassador's house since it happened.

162
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,470
- Why didn't we get them 10 weeks ago?
- Too dangerous.

163
00:14:40,638 --> 00:14:44,099
You got Revolutionary Guards going
door-to-door like Jehovah's Witnesses.

164
00:14:44,266 --> 00:14:47,560
Half of them think that Khomeini's been
too lenient on the ones in the embassy.

165
00:14:47,728 --> 00:14:49,187
What about the White House?

166
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:51,981
Carter's shitting enough
bricks to build the pyramids.

167
00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:53,191
The Canadians are done.

168
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:57,028
They say they're bearing too much risk. Their
foreign secretary corners Vance in Brussels...

169
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:59,739
...and told him she
wants the six of them out.

170
00:14:59,907 --> 00:15:02,450
- Who else knows?
- Just the families.

171
00:15:02,618 --> 00:15:05,328
Meanwhile, some genius in our
embassy was keeping a mug book...

172
00:15:05,496 --> 00:15:08,373
- ... on everybody who worked there.
- Jesus Christ.

173
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,709
We think it got shredded
before they got in.

174
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:14,921
But now the bastards are using
sweatshop kids to reassemble the shreds.

175
00:15:15,089 --> 00:15:18,800
And once they reassemble that book
they'll know six Americans got out.

176
00:15:18,968 --> 00:15:20,552
And they'll know what they look like.

177
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,096
Standing room only for
beheadings in the square.

178
00:15:23,264 --> 00:15:26,850
- Who's handling? - State
is coordinating in-house.

179
00:15:27,685 --> 00:15:29,144
State?

180
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:31,604
- They don't do exfils.
- They do now.

181
00:15:31,772 --> 00:15:34,232
They want to run it by us,
strictly as consultants.

182
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,443
Engell says it's a lose-lose.

183
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:40,321
These people die, they
die badly. Publicly.

184
00:15:40,489 --> 00:15:42,490
State wants the blame,
we'll give it to them.

185
00:15:43,451 --> 00:15:45,285
What does he want me here for?

186
00:15:45,453 --> 00:15:48,246
So he can tell State he ran
it by his best exfil guy.

187
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,254
Okay.

188
00:15:56,464 --> 00:15:59,174
This is Bob Pender from State O.S.

189
00:15:59,341 --> 00:16:01,217
He's been talking to Morgan at ExtAff.

190
00:16:01,385 --> 00:16:03,762
- Bob?
- Thank you.

191
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,597
All right.

192
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:07,640
Mark and Cora Lijek.

193
00:16:07,808 --> 00:16:11,227
Twenty-nine and 25. He's a consular
officer, she's an assistant.

194
00:16:11,562 --> 00:16:14,814
Newlyweds. They only just
got there a couple months ago.

195
00:16:15,566 --> 00:16:19,110
No language skills or
in-country knowledge.

196
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:22,655
Henry Lee Schatz. Agricultural
attache from Idaho.

197
00:16:22,823 --> 00:16:24,616
A bit of an oddball, apparently.

198
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:27,994
He was there to sell U.S.
tractors to Iranian agro.

199
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:30,747
Joe Stafford. Late 20s.

200
00:16:30,915 --> 00:16:32,791
He's smart and a climber.

201
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,042
Speaks Farsi.

202
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:37,045
He arranged the hire of his wife, Kathy.

203
00:16:37,213 --> 00:16:40,507
Embassy was understaffed, so the
faculty wives were the typing pool.

204
00:16:40,674 --> 00:16:43,218
And Bob Anders. Senior
consular officer...

205
00:16:43,385 --> 00:16:45,970
...oldest of the group and
most likely to be group leader.

206
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:49,015
They're in hiding at the
Canadian ambassador's residence.

207
00:16:49,183 --> 00:16:52,977
Fortunately, we do not believe the
Iranians are aware the six have escaped.

208
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:57,232
So, what we like for this are bicycles.

209
00:16:58,025 --> 00:17:01,027
We've identified back roads
from the Shemiran district.

210
00:17:01,195 --> 00:17:03,530
A couple of rat lines
through the mountains...

211
00:17:03,697 --> 00:17:04,989
...to the crossing near Tabriz.

212
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:08,034
Cars are off the table
because of the roadblocks.

213
00:17:08,202 --> 00:17:09,744
We wait till the weather clears up...

214
00:17:09,912 --> 00:17:13,289
...then deliver the six bikes, provide
them with maps to the Turkish border.

215
00:17:13,457 --> 00:17:16,084
We have intelligence
they can ride bicycles.

216
00:17:16,252 --> 00:17:19,212
Or we're prepared to send
in somebody to teach them.

217
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,223
Or you could just send in training wheels
and meet them at the border with Gatorade.

218
00:17:30,391 --> 00:17:31,850
Tony.

219
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:34,018
It's 300 miles to the Turkish border.

220
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:36,604
They'd need a support team
following them with a tire pump.

221
00:17:36,772 --> 00:17:39,148
We were just asked to sharpshoot this.

222
00:17:39,316 --> 00:17:40,692
State is handling the op.

223
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,110
I'm sorry, who is this?

224
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:46,698
Tony's an exfil spesh. He got a lot of
the shah's people out after the fall.

225
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:49,450
Sir, if these people can read or add...

226
00:17:49,618 --> 00:17:52,662
...pretty soon they're gonna figure
out they're six short of a full deck.

227
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:53,630
It's winter.

228
00:17:53,631 --> 00:17:56,833
You can't afford to wait around till spring
so it's nice enough to take a bike ride.

229
00:17:57,001 --> 00:18:00,587
The only way out of that city is the airport.
Build new cover identities for them...

230
00:18:00,754 --> 00:18:03,715
...you send in a Moses, he takes
them out on a commercial flight.

231
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:06,718
- We've explored those options.
- They'll never get past airport control.

232
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:09,429
- Komiteh own the place.
- They could pose as reporters.

233
00:18:09,597 --> 00:18:11,639
- The government issued
70-something... - Seventy-four.

234
00:18:11,807 --> 00:18:13,391
...visas for American journalists.

235
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,560
The Revolutionary Guards
keep them on 74 leashes.

236
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:17,646
If they're caught with
fake journalist creds,

237
00:18:17,647 --> 00:18:19,606
it's Peter Jennings' head
in a noose in an hour.

238
00:18:19,773 --> 00:18:21,900
North American accents
gives us limited options.

239
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:24,068
So we get the Canadians
to issue them passports.

240
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,654
What about English teachers
at the international school?

241
00:18:26,822 --> 00:18:29,490
It's a good idea, but that school's
been closed for eight months.

242
00:18:29,658 --> 00:18:31,284
Okay, so how about the do-gooders?

243
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:36,581
Six Canadians have been over there inspecting
crops, making sure the kids get enough to eat.

244
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:39,292
We give them creds, makes
them look like Ag NGOs.

245
00:18:39,877 --> 00:18:42,587
It's a Feed the Kids thing. Okay?

246
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:44,422
Those kids are black.

247
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,299
Those are African kids.

248
00:18:46,467 --> 00:18:49,677
- We get ethnically appropriate kids.
- Are there starving kids in Iran?

249
00:18:49,845 --> 00:18:52,513
I'm sure there's some
skinny kids in Iran, so...

250
00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:55,516
- What about missionaries?
- A logo with seeds. Call it "Seeds of Hope. "

251
00:18:55,684 --> 00:18:56,726
Hold on.

252
00:18:56,894 --> 00:19:00,438
Sir, do you have this newspaper in front
of you? Would you mind taking a look at it?

253
00:19:02,399 --> 00:19:03,691
What's in this picture?

254
00:19:03,859 --> 00:19:06,110
- Tehran.
- Right. What's on the ground?

255
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:09,948
- Snow.
- Right.

256
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,368
So, what crops are the do-gooders
inspecting under Frosty?

257
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:19,123
Sir, exfils are like abortions.

258
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,959
You don't wanna need one...

259
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:23,962
...but when you do, you
don't do it yourself.

260
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:30,551
You have a better plan?

261
00:19:31,553 --> 00:19:32,971
No, sir.

262
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,102
Whatever the conflicting
signals from Iran today...

263
00:19:39,269 --> 00:19:40,687
...and for that matter, every day...

264
00:19:40,854 --> 00:19:43,898
...about whether the hostages will
or will not be tried as spies...

265
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:47,777
...the government of the United States
has not deviated from its basic demand:

266
00:19:47,945 --> 00:19:50,071
The hostages must be freed.

267
00:19:50,239 --> 00:19:53,074
...claims to defend human rights,
it not only does not defend them...

268
00:19:53,242 --> 00:19:55,994
...it violates them for all nations.

269
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:57,996
We demand extradition...

270
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:01,442
U.S. EMBASSY, TEHRAN... of a man who,
for more than 37 years, with the...

271
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:06,295
United States' support has killed months-old
babies in the arms of their mothers.

272
00:20:06,463 --> 00:20:10,174
He said if the Americans try military
force to rescue the hostages...

273
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:14,053
...the students will kill them
all and blow up the embassy.

274
00:20:14,763 --> 00:20:18,182
Americans were outraged
at Iran and anyone Iranian.

275
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,185
Before that decision was taken,
there was a demonstration in Houston.

276
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,104
An Iranian flag was burned...

277
00:20:23,272 --> 00:20:27,108
...when anti-Iranian demonstrators
gathered near the Iranian consulate.

278
00:20:27,276 --> 00:20:30,528
...also is what led to a decision to
scrutinize the visas of Iranians...

279
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:33,573
They knew exactly what was
going to happen. They knew.

280
00:20:33,741 --> 00:20:36,242
But I don't understand
what they should do now.

281
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,995
Send him back, just to
be tortured and killed?

282
00:20:39,163 --> 00:20:41,539
I don't think that
justice is the worst thing.

283
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:44,500
When did people first tell you
that torture was going on in Iran?

284
00:20:44,668 --> 00:20:48,588
They would never come to me and say,
"Well, sir, we have tortured this fellow. "

285
00:20:48,756 --> 00:20:52,508
President Sadat of Egypt,
he calls you, Imam...

286
00:20:52,676 --> 00:20:55,011
Forgive me, his words, not mine.

287
00:20:55,179 --> 00:20:56,345
...a lunatic.

288
00:20:56,513 --> 00:20:59,515
Why didn't he have a choice? Why do
you think he didn't have a choice?

289
00:20:59,683 --> 00:21:01,017
He would've been referred
to as a barbarian.

290
00:21:01,185 --> 00:21:03,895
That's why they're saying
that their current regime...

291
00:21:04,063 --> 00:21:05,521
The shah did more for women's rights...

292
00:21:05,689 --> 00:21:08,816
I think you'd better... Please,
everyone, get into the crawlspace.

293
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:29,212
At one point, the mob
cornered one of the Iranians.

294
00:21:29,379 --> 00:21:32,799
When he tried to protect
himself, this is what happened.

295
00:21:33,383 --> 00:21:34,759
Just hit him again!

296
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:38,429
We're not gonna take it
anymore! We're sick of it!

297
00:21:39,515 --> 00:21:40,848
America!

298
00:21:41,016 --> 00:21:46,646
Even in our little community here, I mean,
people are drawn up tight, they're tense.

299
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,858
They shouldn't even let those
students in that embassy there.

300
00:21:51,026 --> 00:21:54,237
Just shoot a couple of them,
show them we mean business.

301
00:21:54,571 --> 00:21:57,573
Men who served in Vietnam for what
they believed was right are angry.

302
00:21:57,741 --> 00:21:58,825
I'm mad as hell.

303
00:21:58,992 --> 00:22:03,746
I'm like the guy screaming on that movie
program in Network, you know? I've had it.

304
00:22:03,914 --> 00:22:07,500
And if need be, I'll bear arms again.

305
00:22:07,668 --> 00:22:11,295
And that's the way it is
Wednesday, January 16th, 1980.

306
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:15,716
The 74th day of captivity
for 50 Americans in Iran.

307
00:22:24,268 --> 00:22:26,227
- Hello?
- Buddy man.

308
00:22:26,395 --> 00:22:27,854
I'll get Mom.

309
00:22:28,021 --> 00:22:29,522
I'm looking for you.

310
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,984
Did you do your homework tonight?

311
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:35,903
- Yeah, it was easy.
- Excellent. What are we watching?

312
00:22:36,071 --> 00:22:38,156
Battle for the Planet of the Apes.

313
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:39,657
Tell me, what channel is it on?

314
00:22:39,908 --> 00:22:41,075
Five.

315
00:22:45,122 --> 00:22:46,164
All right.

316
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:51,335
- What'd you do at school today?
- Nothing. I don't know. Nothing.

317
00:22:53,213 --> 00:22:55,756
Can't be nothing.
Something must've happened.

318
00:22:55,924 --> 00:22:57,758
After school I got some baseball cards.

319
00:22:57,926 --> 00:22:59,343
- Mm-hm. -
That was fun.

320
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:18,821
Okay, you know those
science-fiction movies?

321
00:23:18,989 --> 00:23:21,616
Star Trek, Star Wars. They need
an exotic location to shoot.

322
00:23:21,783 --> 00:23:24,243
Moonscape, Mars, desert, you know.

323
00:23:24,411 --> 00:23:25,703
Now, imagine this:

324
00:23:26,955 --> 00:23:31,125
They're a Canadian film crew on a
location scout for a science-fiction movie.

325
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:32,793
We put it out there...

326
00:23:32,961 --> 00:23:34,754
The Canadian producers put it out there.

327
00:23:34,922 --> 00:23:36,547
...that we're looking
at Egypt, Istanbul.

328
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:42,220
Then we go to the consulate and say,
"Hey, we wanna look at Iran too. "

329
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:46,933
I fly into Tehran, we all fly
out together as a film crew. Done.

330
00:23:47,267 --> 00:23:50,311
Flamboyant cover identities should be avoided,
as it increases operational visibility.

331
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:53,522
This is more plausible than foreigners
who wanna go be teachers in Iran.

332
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:56,192
You wanna blend in with the population,
you don't look like a rodeo clown.

333
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,070
Just gonna wake up tomorrow morning
and be in the movie business?

334
00:23:59,238 --> 00:24:01,072
We already have credentials
for the teachers.

335
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,032
- No, sir, we have a contact in L.A.
- Chambers.

336
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,326
John Chambers. He's a
Hollywood prosthetics guy.

337
00:24:05,494 --> 00:24:07,181
He's got an Oscar,
he did 'Planet of the Apes'.

338
00:24:07,182 --> 00:24:09,455
Did a bunch of contract
work for us in the past.

339
00:24:09,623 --> 00:24:13,651
I go see him, he sets us up.
One, two days, make it look real.

340
00:24:28,517 --> 00:24:32,436
I went outside for 30 seconds. Could you give
me a break? I can't breathe in this house.

341
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:35,606
- I need some fresh air. I can't breathe.
- Stay inside the fucking house.

342
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:38,609
- Who saw me go outside? I'm just curious.
- That's not the point, Bob.

343
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:41,028
- It doesn't matter who saw you go out.
- Did you see me?

344
00:24:41,196 --> 00:24:43,531
- No.
- I did, okay? I saw you.

345
00:24:43,699 --> 00:24:46,701
Bob, it only takes one
second for them to spot you.

346
00:24:51,999 --> 00:24:53,708
Some Americans are missing.

347
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:56,043
Look at the repaired
list of embassy employees.

348
00:24:57,546 --> 00:24:59,130
The numbers don't match.

349
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:02,216
Finish assembling the
pictures from the embassy.

350
00:25:02,384 --> 00:25:04,927
All I need is their faces
and I will find them.

351
00:25:05,095 --> 00:25:06,846
Yes, sir, it will be done.

352
00:25:19,109 --> 00:25:20,568
We want you to go to L.A.

353
00:25:20,736 --> 00:25:24,196
If you can make the movie thing
credible, we'll take you to the director.

354
00:25:25,032 --> 00:25:26,073
Don't fuck up.

355
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:28,701
The whole country is watching you.

356
00:25:29,244 --> 00:25:30,953
They just don't know it.

357
00:25:38,295 --> 00:25:39,378
My creation.

358
00:25:40,881 --> 00:25:42,548
My creation.

359
00:25:48,805 --> 00:25:49,889
What the fuck, Brian?

360
00:25:50,057 --> 00:25:51,265
- Cut.
- We're cutting.

361
00:25:51,433 --> 00:25:53,642
- What an idiot.
- It really hurt.

362
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,019
I'm sorry.

363
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:58,147
Chambers. John Chambers, makeup!

364
00:25:59,441 --> 00:26:04,111
BURBANK, CALIFORNIA
- JANUARY 19, 1980

365
00:26:09,951 --> 00:26:13,871
He says the Minotaur prosthetic
is too tight, so he can't act.

366
00:26:14,164 --> 00:26:16,791
If he could act, he wouldn't
be playing the Minotaur.

367
00:26:22,964 --> 00:26:24,382
Mr. Chambers?

368
00:26:25,092 --> 00:26:26,467
Kevin Harkins.

369
00:26:28,303 --> 00:26:29,762
Hey, Tony.

370
00:26:53,954 --> 00:26:55,079
Watch your head.

371
00:26:55,622 --> 00:26:57,164
What are you shooting?

372
00:26:57,499 --> 00:26:59,208
Monster movie.

373
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:01,377
Yeah? Any good?

374
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:04,839
Target audience will hate it.

375
00:27:05,006 --> 00:27:06,507
Who's the target audience?

376
00:27:06,716 --> 00:27:08,259
People with eyes.

377
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:12,179
Talk to me.

378
00:27:14,141 --> 00:27:15,516
It's an exfil.

379
00:27:15,684 --> 00:27:16,851
From where?

380
00:27:18,019 --> 00:27:19,437
Worst place you can think of.

381
00:27:19,604 --> 00:27:20,980
Universal City.

382
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,530
How are you gonna get into the embassy?

383
00:27:29,739 --> 00:27:33,033
They're not in the embassy. During
the takeover, six people escaped.

384
00:27:33,243 --> 00:27:35,035
They're hiding out in Tehran.

385
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:38,497
- And that's who I'm gonna go get.
- What am I making?

386
00:27:39,499 --> 00:27:41,375
I need you to help me make a fake movie.

387
00:27:41,543 --> 00:27:44,044
Heh. You came to the right place.

388
00:27:44,212 --> 00:27:47,381
I wanna set up a production company
and build a cover around making a movie.

389
00:27:47,549 --> 00:27:49,550
- That we're not gonna make.
- No.

390
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:52,470
So you wanna come to Hollywood
and act like a big shot?

391
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:54,597
- Without actually doing anything?
- No.

392
00:27:54,764 --> 00:27:56,348
You'll fit right in.

393
00:28:02,522 --> 00:28:03,731
Let's see.

394
00:28:04,357 --> 00:28:07,776
Well, this one's got an M.A. in
English. She should be your screenwriter.

395
00:28:07,944 --> 00:28:10,863
Sometimes they go along on scouts
because they want the free meals.

396
00:28:11,031 --> 00:28:12,740
Here's your director.

397
00:28:12,908 --> 00:28:15,075
Can you teach somebody
to be a director in a day?

398
00:28:15,285 --> 00:28:17,578
You can teach a rhesus monkey
to be a director in a day.

399
00:28:18,371 --> 00:28:21,582
Look, if you're gonna
do this, you gotta do it.

400
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:24,043
The Kho-maniacs are Froot
Loops, but they got cousins...

401
00:28:24,211 --> 00:28:26,420
...who sell prayer rugs
and eight-tracks on La Brea.

402
00:28:27,255 --> 00:28:30,549
You can't build cover stories
around a movie that doesn't exist.

403
00:28:30,717 --> 00:28:32,885
You need a script. You need a producer.

404
00:28:33,053 --> 00:28:34,220
- Make me a producer.
- No.

405
00:28:34,387 --> 00:28:37,723
You're an associate producer at best.

406
00:28:38,391 --> 00:28:41,435
If you're gonna do a $20
million Star Wars rip-off...

407
00:28:41,603 --> 00:28:45,439
...you need somebody who's a
somebody to put their name on it.

408
00:28:45,607 --> 00:28:47,525
Somebody respectable.

409
00:28:48,735 --> 00:28:49,944
With credits.

410
00:28:50,946 --> 00:28:53,614
Who you can trust with
classified information.

411
00:28:54,616 --> 00:28:56,825
Who'll produce a fake movie.

412
00:28:57,452 --> 00:28:58,869
For free.

413
00:29:12,801 --> 00:29:15,970
Hi. I only got a couple of minutes. I'm
getting a lifetime achievement award.

414
00:29:16,137 --> 00:29:17,721
- Mazel tov, Lester.
- Ah.

415
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:20,391
I'd rather stay home and count
the wrinkles on my dog's balls.

416
00:29:21,393 --> 00:29:25,646
Okay, you got six people hiding out
in a town of, what, 4 million people...

417
00:29:25,814 --> 00:29:29,483
...all of whom chant "Death to
America" all the livelong day.

418
00:29:29,651 --> 00:29:31,235
You want to set up a movie in a week.

419
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:34,822
You want to lie to Hollywood, a town
where everybody lies for a living.

420
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:37,491
Then you're gonna sneak 007 over here...

421
00:29:37,659 --> 00:29:41,161
...into a country that wants CIA
blood on their breakfast cereal...

422
00:29:41,329 --> 00:29:44,832
...and you're gonna walk the Brady Bunch
out of the most watched city in the world.

423
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,751
Past about a hundred militia
at the airport. That's right.

424
00:29:49,296 --> 00:29:50,671
Right.

425
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:54,174
Look, I gotta tell you.

426
00:29:54,342 --> 00:29:58,304
We did suicide missions in the
Army that had better odds than this.

427
00:29:58,471 --> 00:29:59,930
Sir, the car is here.

428
00:30:07,564 --> 00:30:10,608
You ever think, Lester, how
this is all for the cameras?

429
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:13,819
Well, they're getting the
ratings, I'll say that for...

430
00:30:25,707 --> 00:30:27,625
We're gonna need a script.

431
00:30:36,635 --> 00:30:38,719
Here, come on, come on, come on.

432
00:30:38,887 --> 00:30:40,054
- No, it's fine.
- Stop.

433
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:47,394
Okay.

434
00:30:57,572 --> 00:30:58,656
I love you.

435
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:10,584
PAT: Sahar, how are you doing?

436
00:31:11,586 --> 00:31:13,045
SAHAR: Fine, thank you.

437
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:16,507
Your friends from Canada, ma'am.

438
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:20,344
All this time. They never go out.

439
00:31:33,608 --> 00:31:35,442
PAT: Sahar knows.

440
00:31:39,072 --> 00:31:41,240
How about The Horses of Achilles?

441
00:31:41,408 --> 00:31:43,867
No good. Nobody does Westerns anymore.

442
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:48,205
- It's ancient Troy.
- If it's got horses in it, it's a Western.

443
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:49,415
Hey, Kenny, please.

444
00:31:49,958 --> 00:31:51,959
Yeah, it's John Chambers,
about the office space.

445
00:31:52,127 --> 00:31:54,586
It doesn't matter. It's a fake movie.

446
00:31:54,754 --> 00:31:58,257
If I'm doing a fake movie,
it's gonna be a fake hit.

447
00:31:58,425 --> 00:32:02,052
The cardinal wants all cover
options on his desk Friday morning.

448
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,472
Engell's prepping the bikes
option, the teachers option.

449
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,934
You have 72 hours to make yours better.

450
00:32:09,436 --> 00:32:10,644
Fine.

451
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:39,256
Hey, is A 006 still on the open list?

452
00:32:39,883 --> 00:32:40,924
Yeah, I'll hold.

453
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:45,429
"Fade in on a starship landing.
An exotic, Middle Eastern vibe.

454
00:32:45,597 --> 00:32:49,349
Women gather, offering ecstatic
libations to the sky gods.

455
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:52,978
Argo. A science-fantasy adventure. "

456
00:32:53,146 --> 00:32:56,356
- It's in turnaround. It's dog shit.
- It's a space movie in the Middle East.

457
00:32:56,524 --> 00:32:58,150
- Does it matter?
- Can we get the option?

458
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:00,819
Why do we need the option?

459
00:33:00,987 --> 00:33:04,865
You're worried about the
Ayatollah? Try the WGA.

460
00:33:06,701 --> 00:33:08,118
Just let me do the talking.

461
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:11,538
I've known this guy for 25 years. He's
full of shit and he comes on hard...

462
00:33:11,706 --> 00:33:13,373
...but I can handle him.

463
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,836
You want to go into production
with this in one month?

464
00:33:18,004 --> 00:33:19,630
Up like a carny ride.

465
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:20,839
One month, yeah.

466
00:33:21,007 --> 00:33:23,383
- Who are you again?
- Kevin Harkins. Studio Six Films.

467
00:33:23,551 --> 00:33:24,927
He's the money.

468
00:33:25,094 --> 00:33:30,182
Look, what do you say 15
thou and let's close on this?

469
00:33:32,227 --> 00:33:33,894
You want me to be honest with you, Les?

470
00:33:34,062 --> 00:33:36,522
No. I would like you
to bullshit me, Max.

471
00:33:36,689 --> 00:33:38,190
All right.

472
00:33:38,608 --> 00:33:41,068
I enjoyed your films. The early ones.

473
00:33:41,236 --> 00:33:45,364
I took this meeting out of respect,
because I wanted to say no to your face.

474
00:33:46,616 --> 00:33:48,408
Thank you. Very respectful.

475
00:33:48,743 --> 00:33:50,077
You're finished, Lester.

476
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,496
Get your cataracts
fixed, read the trades.

477
00:33:53,706 --> 00:33:56,250
MGM just capitalized for six new films.

478
00:33:56,417 --> 00:33:58,877
They're screaming for sci-fi.

479
00:33:59,128 --> 00:34:02,256
They're offering me four times
what you guys are offering me.

480
00:34:03,758 --> 00:34:07,219
Well, what can I say?

481
00:34:07,428 --> 00:34:09,012
Congratulations.

482
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:13,725
But, see, it kind of worries me, what
you said, and let me tell you why.

483
00:34:14,894 --> 00:34:18,647
Couple of weeks ago, I was sitting at
Trader Vic's, I was enjoying a Mai Tai...

484
00:34:18,815 --> 00:34:20,524
...when my pal Warren Beatty comes in.

485
00:34:20,692 --> 00:34:22,776
He wishes me well, we had a little chat.

486
00:34:23,278 --> 00:34:26,238
Seems he was attached
to star in Zulu Empire...

487
00:34:26,406 --> 00:34:28,615
...which was gonna
anchor that MGM slate.

488
00:34:28,783 --> 00:34:31,869
But Warren confided in me that
the picture's gone over budget...

489
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:34,955
...because the Zulu
extras wanna unionize.

490
00:34:35,123 --> 00:34:37,708
They may be cannibals, but
they want health and dental...

491
00:34:37,876 --> 00:34:39,167
...so the movie's kaput.

492
00:34:39,335 --> 00:34:42,546
Which means that the MGM
deal ain't gonna happen...

493
00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:45,549
...and your script ain't worth
the buffalo shit on a nickel.

494
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:47,968
So the way it looks to me...

495
00:34:48,177 --> 00:34:49,970
Through the cataracts, I grant you.

496
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:51,930
...is that you can either sign here...

497
00:34:52,098 --> 00:34:55,100
...and take $10,000 for
your toilet paper script...

498
00:34:55,268 --> 00:34:57,477
...or you can go fuck yourself.

499
00:34:58,313 --> 00:35:00,397
With all due respect.

500
00:35:06,696 --> 00:35:08,238
You really know Warren Beatty?

501
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:12,159
Yes, I do. I took a leak next
to him once at the Golden Globes.

502
00:35:12,827 --> 00:35:14,119
Taco?

503
00:35:32,472 --> 00:35:33,639
Got any kids, Lester?

504
00:35:34,974 --> 00:35:36,850
Yeah. I have two daughters.

505
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:39,519
You see them much?

506
00:35:40,146 --> 00:35:41,605
I talk to them once a year.

507
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:44,733
- Maybe.
- Why is that?

508
00:35:48,237 --> 00:35:50,238
I was a terrible father.

509
00:35:52,033 --> 00:35:55,327
The bullshit business,
it's like coal mining.

510
00:35:55,495 --> 00:35:58,789
You come home to your wife and
kids, you can't wash it off.

511
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:02,042
You?

512
00:36:03,378 --> 00:36:04,878
Yeah, I got a son.

513
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,256
He lives in Virginia with his mother.

514
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,845
You're divorced?

515
00:36:14,055 --> 00:36:15,847
Taking time off.

516
00:36:17,976 --> 00:36:20,060
He needs to be, you know...

517
00:36:20,228 --> 00:36:21,269
...where he is.

518
00:36:23,731 --> 00:36:25,732
Kids need the mother.

519
00:36:34,367 --> 00:36:37,119
They caught the shah's chief of security
trying to get on a plane to Paris.

520
00:36:40,081 --> 00:36:41,248
Listen.

521
00:36:41,416 --> 00:36:44,793
Since the incident, the number of
guards at the airport has doubled.

522
00:36:44,961 --> 00:36:47,879
Thorough background
examinations should be expected.

523
00:36:48,047 --> 00:36:51,258
The movie cover isn't strong enough
yet. I need another week, Jack.

524
00:36:51,718 --> 00:36:53,552
You don't have it.

525
00:36:55,555 --> 00:36:56,596
We got an office.

526
00:36:57,598 --> 00:36:59,683
We got business cards.

527
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:01,685
We got a poster.

528
00:37:02,603 --> 00:37:05,897
If I'm the Revolutionary Guard, that's
nothing we couldn't have made at home.

529
00:37:06,107 --> 00:37:08,025
Six people's lives depend on this.

530
00:37:09,444 --> 00:37:13,447
It's not enough. If we're gonna
fool these people, it has to be big.

531
00:37:13,614 --> 00:37:16,616
And it has to have something
that says it's authentic.

532
00:37:17,577 --> 00:37:20,787
I did a movie with Rock Hudson one time.

533
00:37:21,748 --> 00:37:24,082
If you wanna sell a lie...

534
00:37:25,126 --> 00:37:27,627
You get the press to sell it for you.

535
00:37:28,588 --> 00:37:32,340
No, no, no. Press event and then
they're gonna read through the script.

536
00:37:32,508 --> 00:37:36,470
Well, they got a bunch of actors,
they're gonna read from beginning to end.

537
00:37:36,637 --> 00:37:38,472
They have costumes and everything.

538
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:42,392
No, no, no, I can't. Variety
has an exclusive on that.

539
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,729
Is there any way to make
this more Middle Eastern?

540
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:47,981
Mesopotamia? Egypt?

541
00:37:48,149 --> 00:37:49,232
Iran.

542
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,986
Look, I can get you in, but you're gonna
have to promise me at least half a page.

543
00:37:53,154 --> 00:37:56,281
No, no, this thing's an event.
It's gonna be a spectacle.

544
00:38:58,219 --> 00:39:01,972
- Lester?
- Nina. You look fabulous.

545
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,223
You're doing the reading?

546
00:39:03,432 --> 00:39:05,559
I'm playing Serksi, the Galactic Witch.

547
00:39:05,726 --> 00:39:07,686
Great. I'll call you.

548
00:39:09,147 --> 00:39:11,731
Keep that fucking space
witch away from me.

549
00:39:11,941 --> 00:39:14,234
- You know her?
- I was married to her.

550
00:39:14,443 --> 00:39:16,069
Oh, my God, Iraq is amazing.

551
00:39:16,237 --> 00:39:17,362
Oh, we're shooting in Iran.

552
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:18,947
Iran with an N?

553
00:39:19,115 --> 00:39:20,699
Yeah. We're very excited.

554
00:39:20,867 --> 00:39:22,159
You ever watch the news?

555
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:24,077
What does the title refer to?

556
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:27,414
The Argo. You know, it's the thing.

557
00:39:27,582 --> 00:39:29,332
Like Jason and the
Golden Fleece, or what?

558
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,418
No, no. It's the ship.
It's the spaceship.

559
00:39:31,586 --> 00:39:36,423
It goes everywhere. It
goes all throughout space.

560
00:39:37,049 --> 00:39:38,216
So it's the Argonaut.

561
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:39,885
No.

562
00:39:40,052 --> 00:39:42,179
- What does "Argo" mean?
- I don't know.

563
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:43,430
You don't know?

564
00:39:43,598 --> 00:39:46,057
It means "Argo fuck yourself. "

565
00:39:48,186 --> 00:39:50,896
Excuse me. May I have your
attention, ladies and gentlemen?

566
00:39:51,063 --> 00:39:55,609
If our artists could settle in. We're
just about ready to begin the reading.

567
00:39:55,776 --> 00:39:59,529
Argo, by Mary Ann Boyd.

568
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:01,907
"Fade in on starship landing.

569
00:40:02,074 --> 00:40:03,617
Exterior, bazaar.

570
00:40:03,784 --> 00:40:06,620
An exotic, Middle Eastern vibe. "

571
00:40:14,295 --> 00:40:17,464
The people working
here are not diplomats.

572
00:40:17,632 --> 00:40:20,091
In fact, as Imam Khomeini said...

573
00:40:20,259 --> 00:40:24,137
...we have found no evidence that
proves that these people are diplomats.

574
00:40:24,305 --> 00:40:28,808
All evidence proves that
these people are spies.

575
00:40:28,976 --> 00:40:32,646
In the name of God, the
beneficent, the merciful...

576
00:40:32,813 --> 00:40:35,440
...our message to the
awakened peoples of the world:

577
00:40:35,608 --> 00:40:38,318
At this time we want to
expose the hateful acts...

578
00:40:38,486 --> 00:40:40,654
Our world has changed.

579
00:40:41,113 --> 00:40:44,074
The fire of hope stopped
burning in this galaxy long ago.

580
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:46,326
The ship is turning around.

581
00:40:46,535 --> 00:40:47,994
Fire the thrusters!

582
00:40:48,162 --> 00:40:50,580
He says a gravitational field
that strong will kill anyone.

583
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:53,124
...were completely unjustified.

584
00:40:53,292 --> 00:40:54,960
They and all others must know...

585
00:40:55,795 --> 00:40:58,672
...that the United States
of America will not yield...

586
00:40:58,839 --> 00:41:01,549
...to international
terrorism or to blackmail.

587
00:41:01,717 --> 00:41:05,428
Sir! We'll be crushed!
There's not enough time!

588
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:08,682
...are controlled by capitalists
and large oil companies.

589
00:41:08,849 --> 00:41:12,352
The United States government considers
revolutionaries as terrorists...

590
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:17,357
...but itself and its CIA are the most
terrorizing organization of all time.

591
00:41:17,566 --> 00:41:20,318
"The story was told, but
there are infinitely more.

592
00:41:20,486 --> 00:41:23,363
Three setting suns. The princess's
robes fall from her body. "

593
00:41:23,531 --> 00:41:26,366
If we find his ship we
will find our chance.

594
00:41:27,368 --> 00:41:31,162
Aboard the Argo lies my
hope, my hero, my husband.

595
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:34,708
We will begin the trials
and carry out the sentences.

596
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:38,908
You wonder where and how this seemingly
endless parade of hatred will end.

597
00:41:38,942 --> 00:41:39,606
EMBASSY BASEMENT - JANUARY 23, 1980

598
00:41:39,607 --> 00:41:43,508
What do they want? They say the
question should be not "what?" but "who?"

599
00:41:43,676 --> 00:41:46,344
The answer to that is clear.
They want their former shah.

600
00:41:46,512 --> 00:41:49,723
...Carter and his administration
shameful to talk about human rights.

601
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:54,144
Carter and his government have given
asylum to the worst criminal of all.

602
00:41:54,312 --> 00:41:55,353
For life?

603
00:41:55,521 --> 00:41:58,898
They will remain until
the shah is returned.

604
00:41:59,191 --> 00:42:02,694
But if the exiled shah, now
in a New York City hospital...

605
00:42:02,862 --> 00:42:06,031
...leaves the United States
for any place other than Iran...

606
00:42:06,198 --> 00:42:08,408
...harsher decisions will be
taken against the hostages.

607
00:42:14,707 --> 00:42:17,334
"We cut outside to the Shidoori Dome...

608
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:19,336
...holding on a single red flower...

609
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:22,922
...as it grows from the ruins
of a starship in the desert.

610
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:26,718
Fade to black. " The end.

611
00:42:32,058 --> 00:42:34,726
There is it. What'd I tell you?

612
00:42:35,102 --> 00:42:36,853
First shot of the picture.

613
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:42,442
Argo fuck yourself.

614
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:45,028
Argo fuck yourself.

615
00:43:07,802 --> 00:43:10,428
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY
OF STATE JANUARY 25, 1980

616
00:43:21,982 --> 00:43:26,569
Brace yourself. It's like talking to
those two old fucks on The Muppets.

617
00:43:30,116 --> 00:43:31,324
Aliens and robots?

618
00:43:32,701 --> 00:43:34,244
Yes, sir.

619
00:43:34,787 --> 00:43:38,123
You're telling me that there is a
movie company in Hollywood right now...

620
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:40,083
...that is funded by the CIA?

621
00:43:40,709 --> 00:43:41,876
Yes, sir.

622
00:43:43,212 --> 00:43:46,798
- What's wrong with the bikes again?
- We tried to get the message upstairs, sir.

623
00:43:46,966 --> 00:43:49,592
You think this is more
plausible than teachers?

624
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,138
Yes, we do. One, there are no
more foreign teachers in Iran.

625
00:43:53,305 --> 00:43:55,515
And we think everybody
knows Hollywood people.

626
00:43:55,724 --> 00:43:57,752
Everybody knows they'd
shoot in Stalingrad...

627
00:43:57,753 --> 00:44:00,228
...with Pol Pot directing
if it would sell tickets

628
00:44:00,438 --> 00:44:02,689
There are only bad options.

629
00:44:02,857 --> 00:44:04,357
It's about finding the best one.

630
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:07,360
You don't have a better
bad idea than this?

631
00:44:07,528 --> 00:44:10,280
This is the best bad idea we have, sir.

632
00:44:10,448 --> 00:44:11,489
By far.

633
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:23,793
The United States government has just
sanctioned your science-fiction movie.

634
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:25,962
Thank you, sir.

635
00:45:02,416 --> 00:45:07,337
I'm required to remind you that if you are
detained, the agency will not claim you.

636
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:10,173
Barely claim me as it is.

637
00:45:12,384 --> 00:45:14,093
Your "in case of's" good?

638
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:16,679
It's just Christine.

639
00:45:19,558 --> 00:45:21,559
I should've brought some
books to read in prison.

640
00:45:21,727 --> 00:45:22,769
No.

641
00:45:23,437 --> 00:45:25,438
They'll kill you long before prison.

642
00:45:27,441 --> 00:45:28,608
- Thanks for the ride.
- Yeah.

643
00:45:38,911 --> 00:45:39,953
Studio Six.

644
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:43,373
We got a green light. Keep the office
running until you hear otherwise.

645
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:46,834
Argo fuck yourself.

646
00:46:05,521 --> 00:46:07,313
Your attention, please.

647
00:46:07,481 --> 00:46:10,984
This is the final boarding call
for British Airways Flight 87.

648
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:45,018
"We are a nation of 35 million.

649
00:46:46,395 --> 00:46:50,189
And many of these people are
looking forward to martyrdom. "

650
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,695
- Hey.
- Hey.

651
00:46:56,405 --> 00:46:57,780
Come to bed.

652
00:46:58,782 --> 00:46:59,949
In five minutes.

653
00:47:11,795 --> 00:47:14,172
You know, she pleaded with me.

654
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:18,176
When it started in the
streets nine months ago...

655
00:47:19,219 --> 00:47:21,721
...she begged for us to leave.

656
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:25,725
She packed our bags, and I said:

657
00:47:25,893 --> 00:47:29,062
"You know what? You know,
just a little bit longer. "

658
00:47:31,398 --> 00:47:33,483
And all I was thinking was:

659
00:47:35,653 --> 00:47:37,195
"Stay.

660
00:47:38,197 --> 00:47:39,989
This is good for me.

661
00:47:41,116 --> 00:47:42,575
Stay.

662
00:47:45,621 --> 00:47:47,246
Show Newsom you got the balls. "

663
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:55,922
I can't believe I put
Kathy in this position.

664
00:48:04,473 --> 00:48:06,849
I think we're gonna die here.

665
00:48:33,836 --> 00:48:37,922
ISTANBUL, TURKEY
- JANUARY 27, 1980

666
00:48:56,358 --> 00:49:00,778
"Iran is 100 percent not in
a prerevolutionary state. "

667
00:49:00,946 --> 00:49:03,990
CIA brief, November 1st, 1979.

668
00:49:04,158 --> 00:49:06,159
Can't be right all the time.

669
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:07,827
Kevin.

670
00:49:08,328 --> 00:49:09,537
When'd you get back?

671
00:49:10,748 --> 00:49:12,957
The shah escaped in a 747...

672
00:49:13,167 --> 00:49:16,502
...so laden with gold bars, it
nearly didn't make it off the runway.

673
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:17,712
But you kept busy.

674
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:22,925
Ferrying out the torture apparatus
of our friend's fallen dictatorship.

675
00:49:23,385 --> 00:49:24,886
It's getting worse.

676
00:49:25,053 --> 00:49:28,014
Everyone who lands at Mehrabad
now fills in one of these.

677
00:49:29,183 --> 00:49:33,060
That slip makes a copy to the one underneath.
Passenger keeps yellow, airport keeps white.

678
00:49:33,228 --> 00:49:34,771
When you leave, they match them up...

679
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:37,315
...to verify you came into the
country when you say you did.

680
00:49:37,483 --> 00:49:41,444
So if they look, they'll see I didn't
come into the country with six people.

681
00:49:42,196 --> 00:49:43,946
If they look.

682
00:49:45,991 --> 00:49:50,995
When you land, you should go straight to the
Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance...

683
00:49:51,205 --> 00:49:52,622
...to kiss the ring.

684
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:56,000
Get on record as having
applied for a film permit.

685
00:49:56,335 --> 00:49:59,921
If they catch you later, at least they'll
be confused while they're torturing you.

686
00:50:03,884 --> 00:50:07,845
IRANIAN CONSULATE
- TURKEY

687
00:50:17,648 --> 00:50:19,774
What will be the purpose
of your visit to Iran?

688
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:23,277
Uh, film production. Business.

689
00:50:25,656 --> 00:50:28,449
Why didn't you get your visa in Canada?

690
00:50:29,827 --> 00:50:33,663
I would've loved to, except my boss
didn't send a telex till I got here.

691
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:37,917
Guy had an intelligent thought in
his head, it would die of loneliness.

692
00:50:58,897 --> 00:51:01,607
The Times and AP found out six escaped.

693
00:51:01,775 --> 00:51:05,111
They know who they are and they know
they're hiding out with the Canadians.

694
00:51:05,279 --> 00:51:07,071
Somebody with one of
the families talked.

695
00:51:07,281 --> 00:51:08,614
Mother of God.

696
00:51:08,782 --> 00:51:11,576
Yeah, I just put Vance on a plane
to take the editors to Le Cirque.

697
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:14,203
He thinks he can get them
to sit on it, for now.

698
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:17,164
Your guy better get them...

699
00:51:17,833 --> 00:51:19,709
...and get the hell out.

700
00:51:20,502 --> 00:51:23,462
The captain has informed us that
we have entered Iranian airspace.

701
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:28,134
We'll be coming through to collect
any remaining alcoholic beverages.

702
00:54:06,334 --> 00:54:08,002
This film crew is just yourself?

703
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:11,505
No, we have six more from
Canada meeting us today.

704
00:54:11,673 --> 00:54:13,507
You like to film at the bazaar?

705
00:54:14,009 --> 00:54:15,843
The bazaar, maybe the palace.

706
00:54:16,678 --> 00:54:18,304
Landmark sites.

707
00:54:18,513 --> 00:54:20,097
I see.

708
00:54:20,891 --> 00:54:22,767
The exotic Orient.

709
00:54:23,185 --> 00:54:26,562
Snake charmers, flying carpets.

710
00:54:27,481 --> 00:54:30,357
You came to us at a complicated time.

711
00:54:30,525 --> 00:54:34,528
Before the revolution, 40 percent of the movie
theaters in Tehran were showing pornography.

712
00:54:35,697 --> 00:54:36,947
I understand.

713
00:54:37,115 --> 00:54:40,284
The function of this
office is purification...

714
00:54:40,494 --> 00:54:43,746
...as well as promotion for the arts.

715
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,625
I'll review this for the minister.

716
00:54:48,376 --> 00:54:49,794
Okay. Thank you.

717
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:01,013
Lester, you're working late.

718
00:55:01,181 --> 00:55:03,099
Till the dawn's early light.

719
00:55:03,266 --> 00:55:07,144
You got stamina, Lester. I wanna be you.

720
00:55:07,354 --> 00:55:10,189
Well, I'm 150 years old, so
you wouldn't be me for long.

721
00:55:20,117 --> 00:55:22,284
- Mr. Ambassador.
- Ken Taylor.

722
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:23,953
Thank you for what you're doing.

723
00:55:24,746 --> 00:55:27,581
I was expecting more of a G-man look.

724
00:55:28,667 --> 00:55:30,668
I think you're thinking of the FBI, sir.

725
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:33,796
Ah. This way.

726
00:55:45,934 --> 00:55:49,645
- These are blank, you know. Stamps...
- Yeah, I'll take care of this.

727
00:55:51,857 --> 00:55:52,982
How long?

728
00:55:53,191 --> 00:55:55,985
A day, prep their covers.
Two if they need it.

729
00:55:56,153 --> 00:55:57,486
And you'll fly out with them?

730
00:55:57,904 --> 00:55:59,530
Yeah.

731
00:55:59,698 --> 00:56:01,365
There's something you should know.

732
00:56:01,575 --> 00:56:04,827
We think our housekeeper
has figured out who they are.

733
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:09,832
We don't know if we can trust
her, so sooner is better.

734
00:56:59,716 --> 00:57:01,008
Hi.

735
00:57:01,176 --> 00:57:03,052
My name's Kevin Harkins...

736
00:57:04,137 --> 00:57:05,721
...and I'm gonna get you home.

737
00:57:07,182 --> 00:57:09,808
These are the screenplays
for your cover identities.

738
00:57:11,436 --> 00:57:13,896
It's theater of the absurd.

739
00:57:14,064 --> 00:57:16,649
- What are our chances?
- Your chances are good.

740
00:57:16,816 --> 00:57:19,944
"Good"? Well, what's the
number value of "good"?

741
00:57:20,153 --> 00:57:22,863
Thirty percent chance of
being publicly executed?

742
00:57:23,031 --> 00:57:26,575
Can you tell me what the objection
was to normal cover identities?

743
00:57:26,743 --> 00:57:28,953
There are no Canadians in the
country for normal reasons.

744
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:30,663
- They'll sniff us out regardless.
- The Swedish Consul?

745
00:57:30,830 --> 00:57:34,500
They accused him of being an American at
the airport. They held him for an hour.

746
00:57:34,668 --> 00:57:37,711
We can't hold up under that. We don't
know what the hell movie people do.

747
00:57:37,879 --> 00:57:39,004
That's why I'm here.

748
00:57:39,172 --> 00:57:42,675
I'm gonna help you. I'll be with
you the whole way. This is what I do.

749
00:57:42,842 --> 00:57:44,885
Have you gotten people
out this way before?

750
00:57:46,221 --> 00:57:47,721
This would be a first.

751
00:57:49,224 --> 00:57:52,810
Do you know that every day they catch
another friend of the shah at the airport?

752
00:57:52,978 --> 00:57:55,479
Kangaroo trials and
then firing squads...

753
00:57:55,689 --> 00:57:58,399
...just for having American
names in their phone books.

754
00:57:58,566 --> 00:58:00,025
You've been here an hour.

755
00:58:00,193 --> 00:58:02,611
And you're asking us to trust
you with our lives, Mr...?

756
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:04,113
Harkins.

757
00:58:04,322 --> 00:58:06,115
That's your real name?

758
00:58:06,783 --> 00:58:07,950
No.

759
00:58:10,912 --> 00:58:14,707
I know there are risks
involved. Serious risks.

760
00:58:15,208 --> 00:58:16,917
But it is time to go.

761
00:58:19,379 --> 00:58:23,007
We've got orders to close the embassy and
go back. There's nowhere for them to stay.

762
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:29,221
We will never make it through
immigration at the airport. I'm serious.

763
00:58:29,389 --> 00:58:33,309
No, no, no, this is what, the part when we
say this is so crazy it might actually work?

764
00:58:33,476 --> 00:58:35,311
Joe, I saw it in Burma.
They get people out.

765
00:58:35,478 --> 00:58:38,731
Snitches in banana republics? They get
them over the border after the coup.

766
00:58:38,898 --> 00:58:39,940
That's your opinion, Joe.

767
00:58:40,108 --> 00:58:42,276
You know, his opinion got
us out in the first place.

768
00:58:42,777 --> 00:58:46,905
If we go out there with fake passports,
we are spies, period. That's execution.

769
00:58:47,073 --> 00:58:49,616
- You got a problem lying, Joe?
- Point is, we can't stay here.

770
00:58:50,285 --> 00:58:53,912
If we get caught, you and Pat go on trial
for harboring the enemy, you know that?

771
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:56,665
Pat and I have discussed
it. It's the risk we took.

772
00:58:57,459 --> 00:59:00,377
That man out there has got bad
cards and he is going to lose.

773
00:59:00,545 --> 00:59:03,839
And if he loses, it's our lives.

774
00:59:05,133 --> 00:59:07,134
And his life too.

775
00:59:08,553 --> 00:59:10,471
Look, we don't have any alternatives.

776
00:59:10,638 --> 00:59:11,847
We gotta go.

777
00:59:18,355 --> 00:59:21,815
These cover identities were created
specifically for each one of you.

778
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:24,526
What you need to do is memorize
everything that's inside.

779
00:59:24,694 --> 00:59:27,613
Who you are, what you are,
where you've been. Complete bio.

780
00:59:27,781 --> 00:59:28,864
And then add to that.

781
00:59:29,032 --> 00:59:32,451
Where do you vacation? What are your
allergies? Who'd you have an affair with?

782
00:59:32,619 --> 00:59:33,786
The only way this works...

783
00:59:33,953 --> 00:59:37,623
...is if you believe that you're these
people so much that you dream like them.

784
00:59:38,583 --> 00:59:40,292
Get started tonight.

785
00:59:41,002 --> 00:59:44,004
I'll be back tomorrow.
We'll get going. Good luck.

786
00:59:49,594 --> 00:59:51,303
Well, my guy kind of sucks.

787
00:59:51,471 --> 00:59:52,846
What's your name?

788
00:59:53,556 --> 00:59:55,849
Mike McEwan, eh? Heh.

789
00:59:56,810 --> 00:59:57,851
That was convincing.

790
00:59:58,019 --> 00:59:59,686
Kathy, what's your name?

791
01:00:27,674 --> 01:00:30,884
The Love Boat will be
seen 15 minutes from now.

792
01:00:31,052 --> 01:00:34,847
The State Department insisted today
that the crisis in Afghanistan...

793
01:00:35,014 --> 01:00:39,101
...will not divert the attention of the
United States from the plight of the hostages.

794
01:00:39,269 --> 01:00:41,979
...is perceived to be if not
impotent, then at least reluctant...

795
01:00:42,147 --> 01:00:46,650
Now the United States finds itself in such
bitter confrontation with the Soviet Union...

796
01:00:46,818 --> 01:00:49,653
...over that country's
invasion of Afghanistan...

797
01:00:49,863 --> 01:00:52,281
The United States is now
moving toward a decision...

798
01:00:52,449 --> 01:00:54,491
...to boycott the Summer
Olympics in Moscow...

799
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:58,871
Bad news, bad news. Even when
it's good news, it's bad news.

800
01:00:59,247 --> 01:01:03,375
John Wayne's in the ground six
months, this is what's left of America.

801
01:01:31,905 --> 01:01:35,532
"The Minister of Culture and Guidance
has approved your location scout.

802
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:37,618
He will send his representative
to meet you and your crew...

803
01:01:37,785 --> 01:01:41,371
...at the Khayyam entrance to the
Grand Bazaar tomorrow at 3 p. m. "

804
01:01:42,248 --> 01:01:43,415
They called your bluff.

805
01:01:43,583 --> 01:01:46,168
- Maybe they're cooperating.
- Absolutely not.

806
01:01:46,586 --> 01:01:50,964
Seven Americans walking the bazaar
is asking for a riot. It's the hive.

807
01:01:51,132 --> 01:01:52,466
Seven Canadians, Jack.

808
01:01:52,634 --> 01:01:55,761
Never give them multiple
shots at a cover.

809
01:01:56,471 --> 01:01:57,763
Are they even ready?

810
01:01:57,931 --> 01:01:59,181
They're getting there.

811
01:01:59,349 --> 01:02:00,891
There's no prize for "Most Improved. "

812
01:02:01,059 --> 01:02:03,769
I don't have a choice. We say no,
they show up at the residence...

813
01:02:03,937 --> 01:02:06,563
...and drag everyone out. You think
their covers are gonna hold up...

814
01:02:06,731 --> 01:02:08,565
...when they're getting
their fingernails pulled out?

815
01:02:29,337 --> 01:02:32,589
You want us to go to the Grand
Bazaar at 3:00 in the afternoon?

816
01:02:33,675 --> 01:02:36,677
You said a day to learn our covers,
then straight to the airport.

817
01:02:36,844 --> 01:02:38,470
They suspect something?

818
01:02:38,638 --> 01:02:41,390
What I know is, we need to
pretend to be a movie crew.

819
01:02:41,558 --> 01:02:44,977
We go to the bazaar today, we
fly out from the airport tomorrow.

820
01:02:47,063 --> 01:02:48,480
We won't do it.

821
01:02:50,275 --> 01:02:52,985
He told them that there were six
of us. So they're expecting six.

822
01:02:53,152 --> 01:02:55,362
It would be suspicious not
to show up at this point.

823
01:02:55,530 --> 01:02:57,656
What else do we have to do, all right?

824
01:02:57,824 --> 01:03:00,367
He's about to show them the
only cards that we're holding...

825
01:03:00,535 --> 01:03:04,204
- which is that they don't know we're here!
- That's the ball game, okay?

826
01:03:04,372 --> 01:03:06,498
Look, we don't have any other choice!

827
01:03:06,666 --> 01:03:09,001
Who says that we'll know
our covers well enough?

828
01:03:09,168 --> 01:03:10,919
We're not in the CIA.

829
01:03:12,046 --> 01:03:13,672
It's suicide.

830
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:15,924
I'm asking you to trust me.

831
01:03:17,343 --> 01:03:18,510
I don't trust you.

832
01:03:21,055 --> 01:03:23,599
This is the game, Joe. What
world are you living in?

833
01:03:23,766 --> 01:03:27,394
The one where they're hanging
people from construction cranes, Bob.

834
01:03:28,187 --> 01:03:30,647
It's too dangerous. I won't
bring my wife into the bazaar.

835
01:03:32,734 --> 01:03:34,067
Joe?

836
01:03:40,783 --> 01:03:42,618
So we'll see you at 2.

837
01:04:05,475 --> 01:04:10,562
So don't be recognizable but look
exactly like your passport photo.

838
01:04:11,814 --> 01:04:14,274
I haven't been this
nervous since our wedding.

839
01:04:16,069 --> 01:04:18,153
Only this isn't a huge
mistake, hopefully.

840
01:04:19,614 --> 01:04:21,490
Sorry. Okay.

841
01:04:24,243 --> 01:04:30,083
Hello?

842
01:04:38,466 --> 01:04:39,758
Who was that?

843
01:04:43,096 --> 01:04:44,805
- Mark?
- Yeah?

844
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:48,684
I'm scared.

845
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:52,270
It's okay.

846
01:05:40,153 --> 01:05:41,319
Where are they?

847
01:05:41,487 --> 01:05:42,821
In the kitchen.

848
01:05:59,756 --> 01:06:03,216
This is what I do. I get people out.

849
01:06:04,719 --> 01:06:07,554
And I've never left anyone behind.

850
01:06:09,265 --> 01:06:11,600
I wish I could believe you, Mr. Harkins.

851
01:06:16,731 --> 01:06:20,025
My name is Tony Mendez.
I'm from New York.

852
01:06:20,193 --> 01:06:22,944
My father worked construction. My
mother teaches elementary school.

853
01:06:23,112 --> 01:06:25,489
I have a wife and
a 10-year-old son.

854
01:06:27,909 --> 01:06:32,579
You play along with me today, I promise
you, I will get you out tomorrow.

855
01:06:36,959 --> 01:06:38,668
Fuck.

856
01:07:19,252 --> 01:07:21,127
Shit.

857
01:07:48,155 --> 01:07:49,656
Hang on.

858
01:08:37,830 --> 01:08:39,456
You all right?

859
01:08:44,712 --> 01:08:46,880
Okay. Tell me who you are.

860
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:49,841
Mike McEwan, cameraman.

861
01:08:50,384 --> 01:08:52,594
Robert Baker, director.

862
01:08:53,054 --> 01:08:55,055
Timothy Harris, location manager.

863
01:08:55,222 --> 01:08:57,223
Mary Ann Boyd, screenwriter.

864
01:08:57,391 --> 01:08:59,142
Rachel Dewart, production designer.

865
01:08:59,352 --> 01:09:01,061
Sean Bissett, associate producer.

866
01:09:01,228 --> 01:09:03,772
All right. Let's go make a movie.

867
01:09:17,078 --> 01:09:19,079
Welcome, welcome. My
name is Reza Bolhani.

868
01:09:19,246 --> 01:09:21,623
- Kevin Harkins. I'm the producer.
- Nice to meet you.

869
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:23,416
This is Mike McEwan, our cameraman.

870
01:09:23,584 --> 01:09:25,794
This is Tim. This is
Mary, our screenwriter.

871
01:09:25,962 --> 01:09:27,462
And this is our director, Bob Baker.

872
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:29,381
- You are the director?
- Yes.

873
01:09:29,548 --> 01:09:32,008
Is this film a foreign-bride film?

874
01:09:32,927 --> 01:09:34,219
Sorry?

875
01:09:34,387 --> 01:09:36,846
A film where a foreign
bride comes to Iran...

876
01:09:37,014 --> 01:09:40,558
...but she doesn't understand
the language or the customs...

877
01:09:40,726 --> 01:09:43,269
...and there is
misunderstandings and laughs.

878
01:09:43,437 --> 01:09:44,896
Oh, no.

879
01:09:50,111 --> 01:09:55,573
The bazaar in Tehran is one
of the largest in the world.

880
01:09:56,158 --> 01:10:00,328
This bazaar has been on this
spot for over 8000 years.

881
01:10:00,496 --> 01:10:04,708
You can find many items
such as paper, spices...

882
01:10:04,917 --> 01:10:07,419
...precious metals, all right here.

883
01:10:07,586 --> 01:10:08,795
Right this way, please.

884
01:10:14,176 --> 01:10:15,552
This way.

885
01:10:30,651 --> 01:10:31,943
- Uh, Mike?
- Yeah.

886
01:10:32,111 --> 01:10:35,131
If I was to say you're looking through
the wrong end of that viewfinder,

887
01:10:35,132 --> 01:10:36,281
...would I be right?

888
01:10:38,576 --> 01:10:40,160
Yup.

889
01:10:47,376 --> 01:10:48,501
Just a little further.

890
01:11:18,491 --> 01:11:21,743
Please wait here. Let's stay together.

891
01:11:38,552 --> 01:11:40,303
He wants the photograph you took.

892
01:11:40,471 --> 01:11:43,556
It's okay, it's her job to take
photographs. She's the production designer.

893
01:11:43,724 --> 01:11:46,976
He says he did not give you permission
to take a photograph of his store.

894
01:11:47,144 --> 01:11:49,813
That's okay. You can
tell him he can have it.

895
01:11:51,107 --> 01:11:53,191
Please, please, just
take the photograph.

896
01:12:02,993 --> 01:12:04,035
Peace be upon you.

897
01:12:04,203 --> 01:12:05,578
SAHAR: And upon you, sir. Welcome.

898
01:12:05,746 --> 01:12:06,996
I hope you are well.

899
01:12:07,164 --> 01:12:08,832
Thank you very much. How are you?

900
01:12:09,041 --> 01:12:11,417
I'm very well. What's your name?

901
01:12:11,585 --> 01:12:12,752
Sahar.

902
01:12:23,764 --> 01:12:26,933
He's saying that the shah killed
his son with an American gun.

903
01:12:36,610 --> 01:12:38,987
No, no, no! No! Canada!

904
01:12:39,155 --> 01:12:40,196
Canada!

905
01:12:40,364 --> 01:12:42,657
I would like to suggest
that we end our visit.

906
01:12:52,001 --> 01:12:53,084
You know, sister...

907
01:12:53,252 --> 01:12:57,255
...those who are with him, Rasool of
Allah, we are tender among ourselves.

908
01:12:57,423 --> 01:12:58,965
But stern against the Kufar.

909
01:12:59,592 --> 01:13:01,009
As God wills it.

910
01:13:02,636 --> 01:13:05,847
But those who sit silently have sinned.

911
01:13:07,308 --> 01:13:09,309
How else may I help, sir?

912
01:13:09,476 --> 01:13:11,811
No, no, just one thing.

913
01:13:13,689 --> 01:13:15,315
How long have they been here?

914
01:13:16,567 --> 01:13:17,609
Pardon?

915
01:13:18,944 --> 01:13:20,653
The guests of the Ambassador.

916
01:13:20,654 --> 01:13:22,030
The guests of the Ambassador.
How long have they been here?

917
01:13:24,909 --> 01:13:26,492
They arrived two days ago.

918
01:13:27,286 --> 01:13:31,998
Forgive my intrusion,
one must be vigilant.

919
01:13:33,292 --> 01:13:36,169
Everyone in this house
is a friend of Iran.

920
01:14:10,704 --> 01:14:12,163
How'd it go?

921
01:14:13,791 --> 01:14:15,416
What about tomorrow?

922
01:14:16,752 --> 01:14:18,294
Tomorrow they'll be ready.

923
01:14:22,216 --> 01:14:24,509
For Kennedy, a stunning turnaround...

924
01:14:24,677 --> 01:14:26,719
...one week after
humiliation in Illinois.

925
01:14:26,887 --> 01:14:28,179
I love New York.

926
01:14:29,556 --> 01:14:32,100
And I love Connecticut too.

927
01:14:32,268 --> 01:14:34,894
How did he win here? Well, he had help.

928
01:14:35,062 --> 01:14:39,691
I'm responsible for anything that
goes wrong in this government.

929
01:14:39,858 --> 01:14:43,903
A man in Scranton is placing a flag
in his lawn for every day of captivity.

930
01:14:44,905 --> 01:14:48,032
When he runs out of lawn,
Kennedy wins the primary.

931
01:14:48,575 --> 01:14:50,994
The six with the
Canadians are coming out.

932
01:15:02,047 --> 01:15:03,631
Who signed off on this?

933
01:15:03,799 --> 01:15:06,592
- You. Where was your passport issued?
- Vancouver.

934
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:08,052
- Where were you born?
- Toronto.

935
01:15:08,220 --> 01:15:10,221
"Torono. " Canadians
don't pronounce the T.

936
01:15:10,389 --> 01:15:12,807
Some Komiteh guard is
actually gonna know that?

937
01:15:12,975 --> 01:15:16,769
If you're detained for questioning, they
will bring in someone who knows that. Yes.

938
01:15:16,937 --> 01:15:20,148
Mary, who were the last three
prime ministers of Canada?

939
01:15:20,607 --> 01:15:23,109
Trudeau, Pearson and Diefenbaker.

940
01:15:23,277 --> 01:15:24,944
- What's your father's name?
- Howard.

941
01:15:25,112 --> 01:15:26,863
- What's his occupation?
- Fisherman.

942
01:15:27,031 --> 01:15:29,282
- Where were you born?
- Halifax, Nova Scotia.

943
01:15:29,450 --> 01:15:31,200
What's your date of birth?

944
01:15:31,368 --> 01:15:33,536
February 21st, 1952.

945
01:15:33,746 --> 01:15:35,663
- Good. What's your job on the movie?
- Producer.

946
01:15:35,831 --> 01:15:38,583
- Associate. Last movie you produced?
- High and Dry.

947
01:15:38,751 --> 01:15:40,251
- Who paid for that?
- CFDC.

948
01:15:40,419 --> 01:15:42,754
What's your middle name?
What's your middle name?

949
01:15:42,921 --> 01:15:44,630
- Leon?
- Shoot him. He's an American spy.

950
01:15:46,342 --> 01:15:50,094
Look, they're gonna try to break you,
okay? By trying to get you agitated.

951
01:15:50,262 --> 01:15:52,388
You have to know your
resume back to front.

952
01:15:52,556 --> 01:15:55,601
You really believe your little story's
gonna make a difference...

953
01:15:55,602 --> 01:15:56,893
...when there's a gun to our heads?

954
01:15:57,811 --> 01:16:00,980
I think my story's the only thing
between you and a gun to your head.

955
01:16:04,318 --> 01:16:05,360
Okay.

956
01:16:10,574 --> 01:16:13,534
Hey, they made it through
the location scout.

957
01:16:25,798 --> 01:16:27,173
You have a call.

958
01:16:38,102 --> 01:16:39,143
What is it?

959
01:16:39,311 --> 01:16:40,395
Go to black on green.

960
01:16:43,107 --> 01:16:44,190
Go.

961
01:16:44,358 --> 01:16:45,817
- It all just changed.
- What?

962
01:16:45,984 --> 01:16:47,776
They're calling the game.
You gotta come back.

963
01:16:47,777 --> 01:16:48,569
What?

964
01:16:48,737 --> 01:16:51,447
Joint Chiefs are planning a
military rescue of the hostages.

965
01:16:51,615 --> 01:16:54,158
Delta Force has started
training to storm the grounds.

966
01:16:54,326 --> 01:16:56,202
So if the six of them...

967
01:16:56,370 --> 01:16:59,997
...are brought down there,
they won't be held for long.

968
01:17:00,833 --> 01:17:04,544
Fuck. Goddamn it. I never would have exposed
them if I wasn't authorized to get them out.

969
01:17:04,711 --> 01:17:07,422
- It's over, Tony.
- If they stay here, they will be taken.

970
01:17:07,589 --> 01:17:12,343
- Probably not alive.
- Listen to me. The thinking has changed.

971
01:17:12,511 --> 01:17:16,180
Six Americans get pulled out of a
Canadian diplomat's house and executed...

972
01:17:16,348 --> 01:17:18,266
...it's a world outrage.

973
01:17:18,434 --> 01:17:21,394
Six Americans get caught
playing movie make-believe...

974
01:17:21,562 --> 01:17:24,230
...with the CIA at the
airport and executed?

975
01:17:24,398 --> 01:17:29,277
It's a national embarrassment.
They are calling the operation.

976
01:17:31,530 --> 01:17:34,073
We're responsible for these people.

977
01:17:35,075 --> 01:17:37,869
What we are is required
to follow orders.

978
01:17:38,745 --> 01:17:40,121
I'm sorry.

979
01:17:49,506 --> 01:17:50,882
Fuck!

980
01:17:57,723 --> 01:17:58,764
Come in.

981
01:18:00,392 --> 01:18:01,976
Ready to try again.

982
01:18:04,229 --> 01:18:06,981
You're ready. You worked hard.

983
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:11,027
Probably the best thing to do
for you right now would be...

984
01:18:11,904 --> 01:18:13,321
...just to relax.

985
01:18:14,156 --> 01:18:15,198
Okay.

986
01:18:15,741 --> 01:18:17,200
You did good.

987
01:18:18,118 --> 01:18:19,410
Thanks.

988
01:18:31,798 --> 01:18:35,092
Scorched-earth policy tonight.

989
01:18:36,803 --> 01:18:38,638
Nothing gets left.

990
01:18:45,771 --> 01:18:47,188
So you know.

991
01:18:48,982 --> 01:18:52,777
ExtAff wants you to burn the
passports before you leave.

992
01:18:54,947 --> 01:18:58,950
If we tell them now, they'll panic. I
think it's best if you just don't show.

993
01:19:01,453 --> 01:19:03,496
It was always a fucked mission.

994
01:19:04,164 --> 01:19:06,457
You came closer than anybody else.

995
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:22,223
If it keeps on rainin'
Levee's goin' to break

996
01:19:24,142 --> 01:19:29,814
When the levee breaks
I'll have no place to stay

997
01:21:34,439 --> 01:21:39,777
Ahem. It's off. They want
us to pack up the office.

998
01:21:41,488 --> 01:21:43,614
This can wait. Let's go get a drink.

999
01:22:08,932 --> 01:22:10,850
He's late.

1000
01:22:24,281 --> 01:22:25,322
O'Donnell.

1001
01:22:25,490 --> 01:22:26,741
Somebody's responsible...

1002
01:22:26,908 --> 01:22:28,743
...when things happen, Jack.

1003
01:22:29,411 --> 01:22:30,953
I'm responsible.

1004
01:22:31,163 --> 01:22:33,748
- I'm taking them through.
- Tony?

1005
01:22:43,675 --> 01:22:48,095
Alan. Alan. We need to confirm those
seven tickets out of Tehran on Swissair.

1006
01:22:48,263 --> 01:22:50,556
- N.E. shut that down.
- I say it's back on.

1007
01:22:50,724 --> 01:22:53,476
- I can't do it. It's backstopped.
- Hey, wait a minute.

1008
01:22:53,643 --> 01:22:56,645
What the hell you talking about,
backstopped? What the hell's that mean?

1009
01:22:56,813 --> 01:22:59,607
Carter's gotta say yes
for us to get the tickets.

1010
01:23:09,409 --> 01:23:10,618
It's time to go.

1011
01:23:20,962 --> 01:23:22,004
All right.

1012
01:23:23,757 --> 01:23:26,550
- Where's Engell?
- He's in a meeting.

1013
01:23:26,718 --> 01:23:29,637
- Pull him out.
- Uh...

1014
01:23:29,805 --> 01:23:30,971
Pull him out!

1015
01:23:31,139 --> 01:23:32,973
Thank you so much. I
really appreciate it.

1016
01:23:33,558 --> 01:23:35,226
- Thank you.
- See you soon.

1017
01:23:35,393 --> 01:23:37,311
- Sahar's on a bus.
- Great.

1018
01:23:37,479 --> 01:23:38,896
Sahar will be fine.

1019
01:23:39,064 --> 01:23:40,815
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1020
01:23:41,066 --> 01:23:44,318
- You two leave right now, right?
- We'll be on a train in half an hour.

1021
01:23:44,486 --> 01:23:45,569
Good.

1022
01:23:49,157 --> 01:23:50,366
N.E. said no.

1023
01:23:50,534 --> 01:23:55,204
This is not a long leasher, and it never
has been, and you don't decide if it goes!

1024
01:23:55,372 --> 01:23:56,580
It is going!

1025
01:23:56,748 --> 01:23:58,749
Jack, you are this close.

1026
01:23:58,917 --> 01:24:00,793
Am I? Am I really that close?

1027
01:24:00,961 --> 01:24:02,920
You are this goddamn
close to the line with me.

1028
01:24:03,088 --> 01:24:06,632
I am not gonna leave him at the airport
with six people and his dick in his hand.

1029
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:10,261
You tell the director to call the
White House. Do your fucking job!

1030
01:24:18,895 --> 01:24:19,979
Get to your plane, Claude.

1031
01:24:26,987 --> 01:24:30,447
First time anyone's gonna ask you a
question is at the first checkpoint.

1032
01:24:31,116 --> 01:24:33,617
The first checkpoint is just
to get a look at your passports.

1033
01:24:33,994 --> 01:24:37,788
Passports came straight from
Ottawa last week. They're clean.

1034
01:24:38,206 --> 01:24:40,040
Find the White House chief of staff.

1035
01:24:40,208 --> 01:24:41,292
How would I find him?

1036
01:24:41,459 --> 01:24:44,461
We're a fucking spy agency! Find him!

1037
01:24:45,213 --> 01:24:48,549
The second checkpoint is immigration.

1038
01:24:48,717 --> 01:24:50,467
You're each gonna
hand them one of these.

1039
01:24:50,635 --> 01:24:53,220
It says that you landed in
the country two days ago.

1040
01:24:53,972 --> 01:24:56,807
They'll look for the matching
white one, which doesn't exist.

1041
01:24:56,975 --> 01:24:58,767
You'll say you don't know what happened.

1042
01:24:58,935 --> 01:25:00,853
And if you believe they
lost the white slip...

1043
01:25:02,105 --> 01:25:03,188
...they'll believe it too.

1044
01:25:04,065 --> 01:25:07,151
Jordan's in the West Wing.
He's not taking calls.

1045
01:25:08,653 --> 01:25:10,154
Where are his kids?

1046
01:25:10,322 --> 01:25:11,363
What?

1047
01:25:11,531 --> 01:25:13,073
Where do his kids go to school?

1048
01:25:20,165 --> 01:25:21,582
Thank you, thank you.

1049
01:25:21,750 --> 01:25:24,001
Pace Academy, Buckhead, Georgia.

1050
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:28,422
White House.

1051
01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:33,177
Yes, this is Mr. Murphy from Pace
Academy calling for Mr. Jordan.

1052
01:25:33,345 --> 01:25:35,679
Yeah, I'm afraid it is an emergency.

1053
01:25:35,847 --> 01:25:38,057
Hold for the chief of staff's office.

1054
01:25:38,266 --> 01:25:40,809
The third checkpoint is the trap.

1055
01:25:40,977 --> 01:25:42,603
It's manned by the Revolutionary Guard.

1056
01:25:43,229 --> 01:25:45,481
Most of them were educated
in the U.S. or Europe.

1057
01:25:46,024 --> 01:25:48,901
And all of whom are
looking for Americans.

1058
01:26:00,747 --> 01:26:01,789
Hello?

1059
01:26:01,957 --> 01:26:03,749
- Jack O'Donnell, from C.I.
- Wait, wait, who?

1060
01:26:03,917 --> 01:26:07,711
Tehran Houseguest operation is ready now.
We don't have the president's go-ahead.

1061
01:26:07,879 --> 01:26:09,964
They are going to be captured.

1062
01:26:10,131 --> 01:26:11,256
David, pick up!

1063
01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:31,443
Zurich. It's under Harkins.

1064
01:26:39,619 --> 01:26:42,287
I'm sorry, sir, I don't seem
to have these reservations.

1065
01:26:45,834 --> 01:26:47,751
Telex on flash.

1066
01:26:48,670 --> 01:26:50,754
Would you mind checking again, please?

1067
01:26:59,431 --> 01:27:02,182
Copy D.S. Confirm the tickets! Go!

1068
01:27:15,697 --> 01:27:17,281
My apologies. It just came through.

1069
01:27:24,956 --> 01:27:26,665
Swissair says they
picked up the tickets.

1070
01:27:26,833 --> 01:27:29,501
Get the L.A. office, tell them
to be ready in case they call.

1071
01:27:29,669 --> 01:27:31,795
We told them to shut that down.

1072
01:28:02,911 --> 01:28:04,328
There you go.

1073
01:28:21,179 --> 01:28:22,596
Not here.

1074
01:29:25,827 --> 01:29:27,578
When did you come to Iran?

1075
01:29:28,121 --> 01:29:29,913
Two days ago.

1076
01:29:30,081 --> 01:29:31,748
What was the purpose of your visit?

1077
01:29:32,834 --> 01:29:35,419
We are looking for locations for a film.

1078
01:29:42,218 --> 01:29:43,302
We have a...

1079
01:29:43,469 --> 01:29:48,348
Oh, yeah. I've got a letter
from the Ministry of Culture.

1080
01:29:49,267 --> 01:29:51,518
If you want to take a
look at that. All right?

1081
01:30:11,706 --> 01:30:13,749
- Ahem.
- You can go.

1082
01:30:23,301 --> 01:30:24,968
Come on, come on.

1083
01:30:35,480 --> 01:30:41,144
Swissair Flight 363 is
now boarding Rows 18 to 35.

1084
01:31:16,354 --> 01:31:18,605
We're going to...

1085
01:31:47,135 --> 01:31:50,846
We're together, yes. The
six of us, we're from Canada.

1086
01:31:52,348 --> 01:31:54,433
Purser's telling Swissair
they're not on the plane.

1087
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,101
They should have boarded already.

1088
01:31:56,269 --> 01:31:57,853
Still no answer in L.A.

1089
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:24,087
Sir.

1090
01:32:34,098 --> 01:32:37,601
STAFFORD: Yes, it's a fantasy
story about a war in another world.

1091
01:32:37,769 --> 01:32:39,478
Here you can see our notices.

1092
01:32:43,775 --> 01:32:45,650
Of course I speak Farsi.

1093
01:32:45,818 --> 01:32:48,028
I wish to make a film in Iran.

1094
01:33:04,796 --> 01:33:08,256
No, I'm the writer.

1095
01:33:08,466 --> 01:33:10,342
Kevin, give me the storyboards.

1096
01:33:10,927 --> 01:33:14,971
These are the drawings that show
what we will film for the movie.

1097
01:33:15,139 --> 01:33:17,808
Alien villains have taken
over the hero's planet.

1098
01:33:17,975 --> 01:33:21,144
They fight for their families
and take back the city.

1099
01:33:21,312 --> 01:33:24,327
The villains know he is the chosen one,

1100
01:33:24,328 --> 01:33:27,651
so they kidnap his son
in the spice market.

1101
01:33:29,195 --> 01:33:31,822
So he and his wife storm the castle.

1102
01:33:31,989 --> 01:33:36,219
The people... hold that...
the people are inspired to join him.

1103
01:33:36,220 --> 01:33:38,995
They are farmers, but they learn to fight.

1104
01:33:42,750 --> 01:33:44,543
They shoot weapons at their enemies.

1105
01:33:48,756 --> 01:33:52,008
And the king of the aliens is destroyed
when the people find their courage.

1106
01:34:01,185 --> 01:34:03,311
You don't go until we verify.

1107
01:34:07,859 --> 01:34:09,901
I understand.

1108
01:34:10,069 --> 01:34:12,237
Sir, you can call our office.

1109
01:34:12,405 --> 01:34:13,738
They'll verify.

1110
01:34:39,015 --> 01:34:41,750
- It'd go all the way throughout the '30s.
- We're shooting right now.

1111
01:34:41,818 --> 01:34:42,973
We're just going to
the Producers Building.

1112
01:34:42,974 --> 01:34:45,896
Yeah, I understand.
We're shooting right now.

1113
01:35:19,931 --> 01:35:23,642
Swissair announces final
boarding for Flight 363 to Zurich.

1114
01:35:31,609 --> 01:35:33,360
Reset! We're back to one.

1115
01:35:33,528 --> 01:35:35,487
- All right, reset.
- We're going again!

1116
01:35:35,655 --> 01:35:38,657
- We're just right at the Producers...
- Right away, everyone! And rolling!

1117
01:35:38,824 --> 01:35:41,117
- We're going to the Producers Building.
- We're rolling.

1118
01:36:17,446 --> 01:36:20,407
Sorry, pal. We're gonna be
in the movie. Call my agent.

1119
01:36:20,616 --> 01:36:21,908
Sir!

1120
01:36:33,838 --> 01:36:35,839
Studio Six Productions.

1121
01:36:36,757 --> 01:36:39,175
May I speak to a Mr. Kevin Harkins?

1122
01:36:39,343 --> 01:36:43,513
I'm sorry, Mr. Harkins is out of country
on a location scout. May I take a message?

1123
01:37:01,157 --> 01:37:04,576
Doors are closing for
Flight 363 to Zurich.

1124
01:37:12,835 --> 01:37:14,044
We can go.

1125
01:37:23,262 --> 01:37:25,430
You keep these. It's a gift.

1126
01:37:52,917 --> 01:37:54,084
Miss.

1127
01:39:58,709 --> 01:40:00,710
Swissair 363, clearance for taxi?

1128
01:40:03,881 --> 01:40:07,383
Swissair 363, you are
number two for departure.

1129
01:40:14,725 --> 01:40:18,561
Ladies and gentlemen, from the flight
deck, we are number two for takeoff.

1130
01:40:55,766 --> 01:40:58,685
Swissair 363, you are
cleared for takeoff.

1131
01:41:02,773 --> 01:41:04,649
Swissair 363, cleared for takeoff.

1132
01:42:09,965 --> 01:42:11,007
We got wheels up.

1133
01:42:11,550 --> 01:42:12,592
Wait.

1134
01:42:28,192 --> 01:42:30,860
Ladies and gentlemen, it is
our pleasure to announce...

1135
01:42:31,028 --> 01:42:34,739
...that alcoholic beverages are now
available as we have cleared Iranian airspace.

1136
01:42:39,745 --> 01:42:41,245
I love you.

1137
01:43:23,288 --> 01:43:25,581
They're clear.
Ha-ha-ha!

1138
01:43:25,749 --> 01:43:27,250
Yes! Yes!

1139
01:43:28,127 --> 01:43:30,253
- Yeah!
- Yes!

1140
01:43:30,421 --> 01:43:31,587
Yeah, man.

1141
01:43:32,047 --> 01:43:33,756
They're out!

1142
01:43:33,924 --> 01:43:37,135
- They're out! They're out!
- We got them out!

1143
01:43:40,472 --> 01:43:41,597
They're out!

1144
01:43:45,978 --> 01:43:47,603
Yes!

1145
01:43:47,771 --> 01:43:49,939
Great work, boys.

1146
01:43:50,107 --> 01:43:51,107
We did it!

1147
01:44:03,120 --> 01:44:06,289
You are admitted to
the Republic of Iraq.

1148
01:44:50,834 --> 01:44:52,668
We made history tonight.

1149
01:44:53,837 --> 01:44:57,173
History starts out as farce
and ends up as tragedy.

1150
01:44:57,716 --> 01:44:59,342
Quote's the other way around.

1151
01:45:00,010 --> 01:45:02,512
- Yeah, who said it?
- Marx.

1152
01:45:03,430 --> 01:45:04,472
Groucho said that?

1153
01:45:09,019 --> 01:45:11,521
Call the Times, nail
it to the goddamn door.

1154
01:45:11,688 --> 01:45:13,397
CIA are the good guys.

1155
01:45:13,565 --> 01:45:15,399
The Canadians are the good guys.

1156
01:45:15,567 --> 01:45:17,276
Yeah, we're not greedy. Them too.

1157
01:45:18,028 --> 01:45:22,532
Only. Canada takes the credit, or
they retaliate against the hostages.

1158
01:45:23,367 --> 01:45:25,201
Great Satan wasn't involved.

1159
01:45:25,953 --> 01:45:27,954
No CIA.

1160
01:45:28,163 --> 01:45:29,705
Is that right, Jack?

1161
01:45:31,875 --> 01:45:33,584
Involved in what?

1162
01:45:34,586 --> 01:45:37,088
We were as surprised as anybody.

1163
01:45:40,050 --> 01:45:41,759
Thank you, Canada.

1164
01:45:41,969 --> 01:45:44,637
We knew that each day
they stayed there...

1165
01:45:44,805 --> 01:45:47,473
...the danger was becoming greater.

1166
01:45:47,683 --> 01:45:51,727
We had been looking for a solution to have them
leave the country during the past three months.

1167
01:45:51,895 --> 01:45:54,564
Day 87, and finally a
sliver of really good news.

1168
01:45:54,731 --> 01:45:58,526
The U.S. Department of State
hereby honors Joe Stafford...

1169
01:46:00,028 --> 01:46:01,445
...Kathy Stafford...

1170
01:46:02,739 --> 01:46:04,448
...Mark Lijek...

1171
01:46:05,075 --> 01:46:10,288
We Americans will be forever grateful to
our great friend and ally to the north...

1172
01:46:10,455 --> 01:46:14,709
...for the protection and the safe
passage provided for our diplomats.

1173
01:46:14,877 --> 01:46:16,127
Bob Anders.

1174
01:46:16,295 --> 01:46:19,005
Here, or anywhere in the world...

1175
01:46:19,173 --> 01:46:20,756
...Canada will pay...

1176
01:46:22,092 --> 01:46:26,095
...for this violation of
the sovereignty of Iran.

1177
01:46:26,263 --> 01:46:30,474
Thank you to Pat and Ken Taylor
and the great nation of Canada.

1178
01:46:34,313 --> 01:46:37,023
So I'm sitting in Jerry's this
morning, I'm having breakfast.

1179
01:46:37,191 --> 01:46:40,276
Waitress comes over to me, she's
waving a newspaper, and she says:

1180
01:46:40,444 --> 01:46:43,821
"You see what those Canadians pulled off?
Why can't we do something like that?"

1181
01:46:44,615 --> 01:46:46,449
And I said to her...
Do you know what I said?

1182
01:46:46,867 --> 01:46:47,992
No, what?

1183
01:46:48,535 --> 01:46:49,994
"Argo fuck yourself. "

1184
01:47:18,774 --> 01:47:19,815
All set.

1185
01:47:20,776 --> 01:47:22,151
Thanks a lot.

1186
01:47:33,288 --> 01:47:34,288
Ha!

1187
01:47:35,666 --> 01:47:39,168
Heh. And I left my
autograph book at home.

1188
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:46,509
His Eminence called me.

1189
01:47:46,677 --> 01:47:47,885
He wants to see you.

1190
01:47:48,387 --> 01:47:50,096
Probably wants to fire me himself.

1191
01:47:51,223 --> 01:47:53,557
He wants to give you
the Intelligence Star.

1192
01:47:54,768 --> 01:47:56,602
You're getting the
highest award of merit...

1193
01:47:56,812 --> 01:48:00,147
...of the Clandestine Services
of these United States.

1194
01:48:01,108 --> 01:48:03,025
Ceremony's on the 14th.

1195
01:48:03,193 --> 01:48:06,362
If they push it a week, I can
bring Ian. That's his winter break.

1196
01:48:07,864 --> 01:48:12,201
The op was classified, so
the ceremony's classified.

1197
01:48:12,369 --> 01:48:15,413
He can't know about it.
Nobody can know about it.

1198
01:48:16,957 --> 01:48:20,042
So they're just gonna give me an award
and then they're gonna take it back.

1199
01:48:20,627 --> 01:48:21,669
That's right.

1200
01:48:23,547 --> 01:48:25,881
If we wanted applause, we
would've joined the circus.

1201
01:48:27,592 --> 01:48:29,719
- I thought we did.
- Ha.

1202
01:48:30,387 --> 01:48:33,180
Carter said you were a great American.

1203
01:48:33,890 --> 01:48:35,558
Great American what?

1204
01:48:36,101 --> 01:48:37,560
He didn't say.

1205
01:48:50,907 --> 01:48:52,158
What happened to your picture?

1206
01:48:53,785 --> 01:48:54,994
It's in turnaround.

1207
01:49:37,287 --> 01:49:38,871
Can I come in?

1208
01:50:24,877 --> 01:50:28,788
The Iran Hostage Crisis ended
on January 20, 1981,

1209
01:50:28,789 --> 01:50:33,221
...when all remaining hostages were released.
They spent 444 days in captivity.

1210
01:50:37,222 --> 01:50:40,299
The involvement of the
C.I.A. complemented efforts of

1211
01:50:40,300 --> 01:50:43,490
the Canadian embassy in
freeing the six held in Tehran.

1212
01:50:43,530 --> 01:50:46,166
To this day, this story
stands as an enduring model

1213
01:50:46,167 --> 01:50:48,650
for international cooperation
between governments.

1214
01:50:48,776 --> 01:50:53,261
All of the Houseguests
returned to the U.S. Foreign Service

1215
01:50:53,262 --> 01:50:55,204
after their ordeal in Iran.

1216
01:50:56,742 --> 01:51:01,872
Oscar-winning makeup artist John Chambers
was awarded the C.I.A.'s Intelligence Medal,

1217
01:51:01,898 --> 01:51:03,385
its highest civilian honor.

1218
01:51:03,386 --> 01:51:06,745
He and Mendez remained friends until
Chambers' death in 2001.

1219
01:51:08,504 --> 01:51:11,935
Tony Mendez's Intelligence Star
was returned to him in 1997,

1220
01:51:11,961 --> 01:51:15,504
when the Argo operation was
declassified by President Clinton.

1221
01:51:25,521 --> 01:51:31,497
He lives in rural Maryland with his family.

1222
01:53:25,932 --> 01:53:31,136
They went in, as you know, under the
guise of creating a motion-picture film.

1223
01:53:31,146 --> 01:53:35,874
But that it had a very
high possibility of failure.

1224
01:53:35,942 --> 01:53:38,235
And after it was successful, of course...

1225
01:53:38,403 --> 01:53:41,196
...it was a great temptation
to reveal all the stories...

1226
01:53:41,364 --> 01:53:44,883
...so maybe I could take a little bit of
credit for it, since I was president...

1227
01:53:44,951 --> 01:53:50,138
...but we had to keep it secret.
Tony Mendez has gone down in CIA history...

1228
01:53:50,206 --> 01:53:51,582
...after his retirement...

1229
01:53:51,750 --> 01:53:57,689
...as one of the 50 most important
CIA operatives of all time.

1230
01:53:59,215 --> 01:54:04,595
Eventually we got every hostage
back home, safe and sound...

1231
01:54:04,763 --> 01:54:08,766
...and we upheld the integrity of
our country, and we did it peacefully.
