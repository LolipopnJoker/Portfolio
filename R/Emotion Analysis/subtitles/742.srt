And, now, you were gonna
tell us about Lady Bagshaw.

182
00:11:15,264 --> 00:11:16,997
Is she a very distant cousin?

183
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:18,632
No. Her father was
my great uncle.

184
00:11:18,634 --> 00:11:20,734
Then why have I
never heard of her?

185
00:11:20,736 --> 00:11:24,338
Because she chose to cut
herself off from the family.

186
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,342
- Do you know the reason?
- Maybe.

187
00:11:27,344 --> 00:11:30,545
See, I believe she means
to cheat your father

188
00:11:30,547 --> 00:11:33,046
of his rightful inheritance.

189
00:11:33,048 --> 00:11:34,515
She has no children.

190
00:11:34,517 --> 00:11:36,984
Your father is
her nearest relation.

191
00:11:36,986 --> 00:11:39,187
I won't have her put
on the spot.

192

ISOBEL:
You're plotting something.

193
00:11:40,356 --> 00:11:42,991
I see a Machiavellian look
in your eye.

194
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:45,760
Machiavelli is
frequently underrated.

195
00:11:45,762 --> 00:11:48,429
He had many qualities.

196
00:11:48,431 --> 00:11:50,564
So did Caligula,
not all of them charming.

197
00:11:50,566 --> 00:11:53,166
What are you up to, Granny?

198
00:11:53,168 --> 00:11:58,139
Well, ideally, I would like
Maud to see your father

199
00:11:58,141 --> 00:12:00,174
as the son she never had.

200
00:12:00,176 --> 00:12:02,577

I never had?

Mr. Bakewell said
that you'd warned him

that there was to be
a royal visit.

- Thank you.

Never for drinking.

1046

Lady Hexham these days,
Mr. Bates, but...

1047
00:47:05,378 --> 00:47:08,514
Thank you, Albert.
It's a relief.

1054

this up? Mr. Molesley?

1055

Andrew, yes.

1063

1075

You mean after the strike, sir?

1076
00:48:09,677 --> 00:48:12,777
Yes, if calmer means
more resigned.

1077
00:48:12,779 --> 00:48:14,646

1078

Hmm.
And you, Lady Grantham.

1079
00:48:17,451 --> 00:48:19,751
Were you affected
by the general strike?

1080
00:48:19,753 --> 00:48:24,924
Well, my maid was rather curt
with me while it was on, sir.

1081
00:48:24,926 --> 00:48:28,393
But, you know,
she is a communist at heart.

1082
00:48:28,395 --> 00:48:30,764
(chuckling): So I suppose
it was only to be expected.

1083

Wasn't the princess joining us?

1084
00:48:34,435 --> 00:48:35,934
Uh, they telephoned.

1085
00:48:35,936 --> 00:48:38,704
Lord Lacelles has been
held up by something.

1086
00:48:38,706 --> 00:48:41,639
Uh, but they are planning

I imagine the servants' bedrooms

1088

Why? Are you worried
for your maid?

1090

How clever of you.

1091
00:48:48,848 --> 00:48:50,782
Lucy is more of a companion
than a maid.

1092
00:48:50,784 --> 00:48:52,418
I'd hate for her
to be uncomfortable.

1093
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:54,389
Of course.

You can't embarrass Mama.

1096
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:03,262
I'm sorry, but you must wait
until we stand.

1097
00:49:03,264 --> 00:49:06,364
KING GEORGE: Lord Hexham,
how is Northumberland?

1098
00:49:06,366 --> 00:49:08,300
As beautiful as ever, sir.

1099
00:49:08,302 --> 00:49:10,305
Can it spare you, do you think?

1100
00:49:12,572 --> 00:49:14,005
Well, that was humiliating.

1101
00:49:14,007 --> 00:49:16,541
(scoffs) Go on.

1102
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:19,645
Oh! Well, we might as well
all go for a walk.

1103
00:49:19,647 --> 00:49:21,380
We cannot challenge the way

1104
00:49:21,382 --> 00:49:23,514

Mrs. Patmore.

1105
00:49:23,516 --> 00:49:25,451

- Why don't we all meet

1106
00:49:25,453 --> 00:49:27,886
- back here after the parade?
- CARSON: Anna, Mr. Bates,

1107
00:49:27,888 --> 00:49:31,657
there must be no trouble or
disloyal tomfoolery of any kind.

1108

1109
00:49:33,661 --> 00:49:36,027
We'll meet in the wine cellar.

- (sighs) No.

1114

- we should get moving.
- Ah. - Of course, sir.

1115

ISOBEL:
I'm so looking forward to this.

earlier? I couldn't hear.

He's planning a tour for the
Prince of Wales next March.

1121
00:49:59,987 --> 00:50:02,554
It'll take in most
of the African colonies

1122
00:50:02,556 --> 00:50:04,889
- and finish in Cape Town.
- And he wants you to go?

1123
00:50:04,891 --> 00:50:07,826

I'm a steadying influence.

01:02:48,054 --> 01:02:51,422
Certainly not to a stranger.

1380
01:02:51,424 --> 01:02:53,090
That seems odd, as the Crawleys

1381
01:02:53,092 --> 01:02:55,159
would die for the Crown
if they had to.

1382
01:02:55,161 --> 01:02:57,661
You can love people
you disagree with.

1383
01:02:57,663 --> 01:03:00,230
And you love them?

1384
01:03:00,232 --> 01:03:02,833
They're decent at the core.

1385
01:03:02,835 --> 01:03:06,204
People can be decent at the core
but very difficult to live with.

1386
01:03:06,206 --> 01:03:07,639
True enough.

1387
01:03:07,641 --> 01:03:10,340
And they're silly, too,
and snobbish at times.

1388
01:03:10,342 --> 01:03:13,244
And I wouldn't give tuppence
for their politics.

1389
01:03:13,246 --> 01:03:16,081
But I've learned to be happy
with all of that.

1390
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:18,215
And besides...

1391
01:03:18,217 --> 01:03:20,819
they're my daughter's family.

1392
01:03:20,821 --> 01:03:22,619
(chattering indistinctly)

1393
01:03:22,621 --> 01:03:24,422
PRINCESS MARY:
And she lives here?

1394
01:03:24,424 --> 01:03:28,326
I nearly took her away once.

1395
01:03:28,328 --> 01:03:31,228
But she belongs here now.

1396
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:34,199
I spent so much of my life
not belonging anywhere.

1397
01:03:34,201 --> 01:03:36,536
That's important to me.

1398
01:03:38,605 --> 01:03:41,172
I suppose, in the end,
it's deciding

1399
01:03:41,174 --> 01:03:43,543
what's important, isn't it?

1400
01:03:46,378 --> 01:03:49,346
You've given me a great deal
to think about, Mr. Branson.

1401
01:03:49,348 --> 01:03:50,882
Good things, I hope.

1402
01:03:50,884 --> 01:03:53,684
That may be so, but...

1403
01:03:53,686 --> 01:03:56,156
now we must go in.

1404
01:04:00,594 --> 01:04:02,126
(quiet chatter)

1405
01:04:02,128 --> 01:04:03,494
We must change.

1406
01:04:03,496 --> 01:04:05,295
And you leave in the morning.

1407
01:04:05,297 --> 01:04:07,599
I wonder if we might have
a talk later.

1408
01:04:07,601 --> 01:04:08,833
We'll find a cozy spot.

1409
01:04:08,835 --> 01:04:10,869
And Robert can join us.

1410
01:04:10,871 --> 01:04:12,737
I won't be interrogated, Violet.

1411
01:04:12,739 --> 01:04:16,808
Please, don't miss the chance
to settle things between you.

1412
01:04:16,810 --> 01:04:18,742
Very well.

1413
01:04:18,744 --> 01:04:20,777
But now I must go.

1414
01:04:20,779 --> 01:04:22,715
♪ ♪

1415
01:04:25,719 --> 01:04:28,152
That was helpful.
Thank you.

1416
01:04:28,154 --> 01:04:29,786
Well, I told you
I wanted to help.

1417
01:04:29,788 --> 01:04:32,359
Well, thanks to you,
we have her cornered.

1418
01:04:37,197 --> 01:04:38,862
Mr. Wilson.

1419
01:04:38,864 --> 01:04:40,898
There's a telephone call
for you.

1420
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:42,766
For me?

1421
01:04:42,768 --> 01:04:45,536
But, Sir Harry, they wouldn't
get to London until 9:00.

1422
01:04:45,538 --> 01:04:47,172
(over phone):
It doesn't matter.

1423
01:04:47,174 --> 01:04:49,373
The ball at Clarence House
won't start till 10:00.

1424
01:04:49,375 --> 01:04:51,375
What ball at Clarence House?

1425
01:04:51,377 --> 01:04:52,876
The Duke of Connaught's.

1426
01:04:52,878 --> 01:04:54,712
What are you playing at, Wilson?

1427
01:04:54,714 --> 01:04:56,280
I'm not questioning you, sir,

1428
01:04:56,282 --> 01:04:58,349
not if it's what
the Duke of Connaught wishes.

1429
01:04:58,351 --> 01:05:00,284
But how do I manage here?

1430
01:05:00,286 --> 01:05:02,186
Don't they have footmen
at Downton?

1431
01:05:02,188 --> 01:05:04,822
Yes, there are footmen.
But won't His Majesty...

1432
01:05:04,824 --> 01:05:07,224
His Majesty won't give
a tinker's cuss!

1433
01:05:07,226 --> 01:05:10,663
- Now, do as I say.
- Of course, Sir Harry. At once.

1434
01:05:12,732 --> 01:05:13,500
(snickering)

1435
01:05:16,569 --> 01:05:18,802
Everything all right,
Mr. Wilson?

1436
01:05:18,804 --> 01:05:20,471
I need to see my footmen

1437
01:05:20,473 --> 01:05:22,607
and the house footmen
and the hall boy.

1438
01:05:22,609 --> 01:05:24,808
Uh, when is the next train
to London?

1439
01:05:24,810 --> 01:05:26,513
I hope it's not bad news.

1440
01:05:28,248 --> 01:05:30,848
Not bad, exactly.

1441
01:05:30,850 --> 01:05:33,217
But irregular.

1442
01:05:33,219 --> 01:05:35,522
Very irregular, indeed.

1443
01:05:37,389 --> 01:05:38,989
(laughter)

1444
01:05:38,991 --> 01:05:42,360
I'll get drummed out of the
regiment if they ever find out.

1445
01:05:42,362 --> 01:05:44,362
Well, you sounded
convincing to me.

1446
01:05:44,364 --> 01:05:46,431
Oh, I'm very good
at doing Sir Harry Barnston,

1447
01:05:46,433 --> 01:05:49,433
- I can assure you.
- What if Mr. Wilson rings back?

1448
01:05:49,435 --> 01:05:51,436
No one queries
Sir Harry's orders.

1449
01:05:51,438 --> 01:05:52,704
But if he did?

1450
01:05:52,706 --> 01:05:54,706
Well, then they'd
uncover the trick.

1451
01:05:54,708 --> 01:05:57,275
But they couldn't
trace it back to me.

1452
01:05:57,277 --> 01:05:59,376
Right. Shall we go into York?

1453
01:05:59,378 --> 01:06:01,679
Sorry to miss out
on the fun, in a way.

1454
01:06:01,681 --> 01:06:04,549
Where shall I wait for you
when you're with your parents?

1455
01:06:04,551 --> 01:06:06,186
We'll find a pub.

1456
01:06:08,455 --> 01:06:10,387
(sighs)

1457
01:06:10,389 --> 01:06:11,989
(door opens)

1458
01:06:11,991 --> 01:06:14,692
Did you manage
to speak to someone?

1459
01:06:14,694 --> 01:06:17,328
I got hold
of Madame Seymour's assistant.

1460
01:06:17,330 --> 01:06:18,895
They've sent you the wrong one.

1461
01:06:18,897 --> 01:06:21,666
It's similar in style
but not, as you can see,

1462
01:06:21,668 --> 01:06:24,501
- in size.
- Well, where's my dress now?

1463
01:06:24,503 --> 01:06:25,940
On its way to New York.

1464
01:06:27,273 --> 01:06:28,405
Well, that's that, then.

1465
01:06:28,407 --> 01:06:30,275
(sighs) Wonderful.

1466
01:06:30,277 --> 01:06:31,976
Everything's going wrong
for me today.

1467
01:06:31,978 --> 01:06:35,313
- Milady?
- Oh. Never mind.

1468
01:06:35,315 --> 01:06:38,349
How are things downstairs?
Any better?

1469
01:06:38,351 --> 01:06:40,684
A bit better, yes, milady.

1470
01:06:40,686 --> 01:06:43,288
In fact,
I ought to be getting back.

1471
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:44,558
Of course.

1472
01:06:46,893 --> 01:06:48,759
Oh, one thing.

1473
01:06:48,761 --> 01:06:51,895
The painted glass
that used to sit by my bed,

1474
01:06:51,897 --> 01:06:53,900
was it broken while I was away?

1475
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,567
Leave it with me, milady.

1476
01:06:57,569 --> 01:06:59,436
And the dress.

1477
01:06:59,438 --> 01:07:02,639
You wouldn't mind a fitting
later tonight, would you?

1478
01:07:02,641 --> 01:07:04,741
I don't understand.
Who with?

1479
01:07:04,743 --> 01:07:07,547
I just had an idea.

1480
01:07:08,781 --> 01:07:10,782
(door opens)

1481
01:07:10,784 --> 01:07:11,983
LUCY:
I shouldn't think so,

1482
01:07:11,985 --> 01:07:13,817
not if she knows
what's good for her.

1483
01:07:13,819 --> 01:07:15,453
- (chuckles)
- Oh, I...

1484
01:07:15,455 --> 01:07:17,822
I'm sorry to interrupt.

1485
01:07:17,824 --> 01:07:20,657
How clever of you to find me.

1486
01:07:20,659 --> 01:07:23,661
Well, not really.
I lived here 40 years.

1487
01:07:23,663 --> 01:07:25,596
I assume this is your maid?

1488
01:07:25,598 --> 01:07:28,699
- Yes, this is Lucy Smith.
- Oh.

1489
01:07:28,701 --> 01:07:30,400
Good evening, Smith.

1490
01:07:30,402 --> 01:07:32,603
Good evening, milady.

1491
01:07:32,605 --> 01:07:35,038
- Shall I go?
- No, not for me.

1492
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:37,875
Not for me.
I'm delighted to meet you.

1493
01:07:37,877 --> 01:07:40,610
I've heard so much about you.

1494
01:07:40,612 --> 01:07:42,579
Is there something you want?

1495
01:07:42,581 --> 01:07:43,915
Hmm?

1496
01:07:43,917 --> 01:07:46,083
Oh, just-just to see
you're comfortable

1497
01:07:46,085 --> 01:07:48,985
and to confirm
our little chat for later.

1498
01:07:48,987 --> 01:07:50,788
I live my own life now, Violet.

1499
01:07:50,790 --> 01:07:52,590
I'm not what I was.

1500
01:07:52,592 --> 01:07:54,592
My father is gone.
My husband is gone.

1501
01:07:54,594 --> 01:07:56,793
I see no reason
not to do what I want.

1502
01:07:56,795 --> 01:07:59,630
Well, that doesn't mean
there is no reason,

1503
01:07:59,632 --> 01:08:02,132
merely that you cannot see it.

1504
01:08:02,134 --> 01:08:04,134
I think Lady Merton is right.

1505
01:08:04,136 --> 01:08:07,105
We'll have it out,
once and for all.

1506
01:08:07,107 --> 01:08:09,409
But now I must go
to Her Majesty.

1507
01:08:14,413 --> 01:08:15,581
Hmm.

1508
01:08:18,985 --> 01:08:21,385
WILSON: You're not to speak.
You're not to think.

1509
01:08:21,387 --> 01:08:23,054
Just follow my lead.

1510
01:08:23,056 --> 01:08:26,157
Their Majesties must not know
they're being served

1511
01:08:26,159 --> 01:08:27,891
by anyone different.
Do you hear me?

1512
01:08:27,893 --> 01:08:29,894
I don't want them
to even notice.

1513
01:08:29,896 --> 01:08:31,595
We will do our best, Mr. Wilson.

1514
01:08:31,597 --> 01:08:32,796
I don't want your best.

1515
01:08:32,798 --> 01:08:34,665
I want far better
than your best.

1516
01:08:34,667 --> 01:08:37,435
Is everything under control
here, Mr. Wilson?

1517
01:08:37,437 --> 01:08:39,636
I gather the others
caught the train.

1518
01:08:39,638 --> 01:08:41,872
And this is
what we're left with.

1519
01:08:41,874 --> 01:08:44,675
Mind you don't disgrace
the state livery, Albert.

1520
01:08:44,677 --> 01:08:46,144
Of course, Mr. Carson.

1521
01:08:46,146 --> 01:08:48,145
Where is Monsieur Courbet?

1522
01:08:48,147 --> 01:08:50,848
- I came in here to see him.
- PATMORE: Uh, he went out.

1523
01:08:50,850 --> 01:08:53,917
So I thought I'd better get on
with dinner. Wasn't I right?

1524
01:08:53,919 --> 01:08:56,753
- No, you were not right. You were entirely wrong!
- Oh!

1525
01:08:56,755 --> 01:08:57,857
(gasping)

1526
01:08:58,958 --> 01:09:00,625
Oh, I'm sorry.

1527
01:09:00,627 --> 01:09:03,629
I don't know h-how
that happened.

1528
01:09:05,197 --> 01:09:08,468
WILSON: Well, I shall
have to go and change.

1529
01:09:09,768 --> 01:09:12,705
We'll sort this out
when I return.

1530
01:09:22,449 --> 01:09:23,717
(whispers):
Andy.

1531
01:09:29,088 --> 01:09:30,854
BERTIE: If you don't
want me to, I won't.

1532
01:09:30,856 --> 01:09:32,155
But you've already said
that you will.

1533
01:09:32,157 --> 01:09:34,458
Because it's a fantastic chance.

1534
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:36,226
It didn't occur to me
you'd mind.

1535
01:09:36,228 --> 01:09:38,662
I don't, exactly.
Not in that way.

1536
01:09:38,664 --> 01:09:39,729
Then in what way?

1537
01:09:39,731 --> 01:09:41,232
I wasn't going to tell you.

1538
01:09:41,234 --> 01:09:44,668
I wasn't going
to tell anyone, but...

1539
01:09:44,670 --> 01:09:46,737
I might be pregnant.

1540
01:09:46,739 --> 01:09:48,672
(both chuckle softly)

1541
01:09:48,674 --> 01:09:50,511
Oh, darling.

1542
01:09:52,178 --> 01:09:54,511
- How marvelous.
- (both chuckle)

1543
01:09:54,513 --> 01:09:56,247
How fabulous.

1544
01:09:56,249 --> 01:09:58,216
My heart is bursting.

1545
01:09:58,218 --> 01:10:00,016
Oh, well, that's
exactly what I don't want.

1546
01:10:00,018 --> 01:10:02,519
- It could easily go wrong.
- Oh, but-but if it doesn't...

1547
01:10:02,521 --> 01:10:04,020
Then I'll give birth

1548
01:10:04,022 --> 01:10:07,093
just as you set off on

01:27:14,253 --> 01:27:16,252
She does.

1892
01:27:16,254 --> 01:27:18,555
For years,
I said I was her godmother,

1893
01:27:18,557 --> 01:27:20,857
but I told her the truth
on her 18th birthday.

1894
01:27:20,859 --> 01:27:23,693
How old was she when Jack died?

1895
01:27:23,695 --> 01:27:25,929
Six.

1896
01:27:25,931 --> 01:27:29,198
She'd lived with Jack
and his mother until then.

1897
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:30,800
But I took her into the house,

1898
01:27:30,802 --> 01:27:32,167
and she went
to the village school

1899
01:27:32,169 --> 01:27:34,537
until, eventually,
she became my maid.

1900
01:27:34,539 --> 01:27:36,238
I suppose
if she'd been your ward,

1901
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:37,841
people would have guessed.

1902
01:27:37,843 --> 01:27:39,208
Exactly.

1903
01:27:39,210 --> 01:27:41,077
Who takes notice of a servant?

1904
01:27:41,079 --> 01:27:42,982
I hid her in plain sight.

1905
01:27:44,115 --> 01:27:45,917
Did you love Jack Smith?

1906
01:27:49,021 --> 01:27:52,588
Everyone should know
a total love at least once.

1907
01:27:52,590 --> 01:27:55,026
Jack was mine.

1908
01:27:58,129 --> 01:28:01,564
My husband was very dull,
you know?

1909
01:28:01,566 --> 01:28:03,600
He wasn't a bad man, but...

1910
01:28:03,602 --> 01:28:06,670
but he wasn't a clever one,
either.

1911
01:28:06,672 --> 01:28:09,905
Then he died,
and Jack came to see me,

1912
01:28:09,907 --> 01:28:11,774
and it began from there.

1913
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:13,877
How daring.

1914
01:28:13,879 --> 01:28:15,744
I know it sounds reckless,

1915
01:28:15,746 --> 01:28:17,948
but I was 39
when I got pregnant.

1916
01:28:17,950 --> 01:28:20,750
I thought I was barren.

1917
01:28:20,752 --> 01:28:24,787
Of course, I knew I couldn't
tell my father, so...

1918
01:28:24,789 --> 01:28:26,756
I went to America.

1919
01:28:26,758 --> 01:28:28,658
They must have
thought that wild.

1920
01:28:28,660 --> 01:28:32,628
Well, little did they know
how wild it really was.

1921
01:28:32,630 --> 01:28:34,764
But you were happy with Jack?

1922
01:28:34,766 --> 01:28:38,033
(chuckles):
Oh, very.

1923
01:28:38,035 --> 01:28:40,806
We had ten years together
before he died.

1924
01:28:42,340 --> 01:28:46,242
I'd have married him
if I'd had the courage.

1925
01:28:46,244 --> 01:28:48,345
I was weak.

1926
01:28:48,347 --> 01:28:50,913
But you never knew my father.

1927
01:28:50,915 --> 01:28:53,750
I suppose royal service
kept you silent on the subject.

1928
01:28:53,752 --> 01:28:54,984
Yes.

1929
01:28:54,986 --> 01:28:57,886
In a way.

1930
01:28:57,888 --> 01:29:00,092
But it was cowardice, really.

1931
01:29:01,826 --> 01:29:04,193
Now, by making Lucy my heir,

1932
01:29:04,195 --> 01:29:06,965
I will have taken
the first step.

1933
01:29:08,667 --> 01:29:10,667
You must tell Violet at once.

- I couldn't.
- You're wrong.

1935
01:29:12,670 --> 01:29:15,037
As soon as she knows the truth,
she'll fathom your plans

1936
01:29:15,039 --> 01:29:17,774
and cease to fight you.

1937
01:29:17,776 --> 01:29:20,976

enjoying themselves tonight.

1941

But you're right.
We did have fun.

1942

Well, I'm glad it's gone well
for everyone.

1943

I could face doing it again.

1949

Should we really go on with it?

1950
01:29:50,808 --> 01:29:53,275
We're running the house
with too few people as it is,

1951
01:29:53,277 --> 01:29:56,145
and half of those here now
will leave soon.

1952
