Yeah.

345

A mistake? Why?

533

There is an argument
for catching Bourne instead of killing him.

All right, let's hear it.

535
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,930
Bourne's been off the grid
for a long time.

536

He's been hiding in the shadows,
he's seen things.

537
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,967
He knows things that
could help us.

538
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:55,010
Bringing him back in is
the smart move.

539
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,645
And how are we going
to do that?

540
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,404
Albert Hirsch wrote a psych
evaluation

541
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,720
when Bourne left
the program.

542
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,611
He concluded Bourne is still
a patriot at heart,

543
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:03,886
and that leaving
the program

544
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,088
could come back to
haunt him.

545
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,604
And what are you
suggesting?

546
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:12,047
I watched Bourne
with those files.

547
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,244
Desperately
looking into his past.

548
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:18,563
And I think he's at
a tipping point.

549
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:21,291
If I could get
face-to-face with him,

550
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,010
I think I can
bring him back in.

551
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:24,881
One attempt.

552
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,883
And if it fails,

553
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,528
you do what you have to.

554
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,765
Well, it makes sense to me.
What do you think, Bob?

555
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,082
Let's give it a shot.

Director Dewey's

Unwise?

Dewey's problem was
that he belonged in the past.

you can bring him in?

put down.
