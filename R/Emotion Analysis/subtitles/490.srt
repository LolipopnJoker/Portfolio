2
00:00:54,606 --> 00:00:56,439
They've broken through
the front lines!

3
00:00:56,441 --> 00:00:58,075
I've lost contact
with the capital!

4
00:00:58,077 --> 00:00:59,611
There's too many of them!

5
00:01:01,781 --> 00:01:03,015
Stand fast!

6
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:07,217
Finish them!

7
00:01:18,664 --> 00:01:20,532
Where's B-127?

8
00:01:34,281 --> 00:01:36,079
Sorry I'm late.
I hit a little traffic.

9
00:01:36,081 --> 00:01:38,048
Get down!
Incoming!

10
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,051
Uh, Optimus.

11
00:01:41,153 --> 00:01:45,289
Decepticons, attack!

12
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:49,928
Autobots, fall back!
Get to the tower!

13
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:54,034
Destroy the launch pad!
Let none escape!

14
00:01:59,872 --> 00:02:03,941
Cybertron has fallen.
Get to the escape pods.

15
00:02:03,943 --> 00:02:07,144
There are other Autobots
scattered across the galaxy.

16
00:02:07,146 --> 00:02:09,478
We must reach them
if we hope to survive.

17
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,017
Optimus, this is our home.
We have to fight for it.

18
00:02:17,857 --> 00:02:21,792
We will fight on. But we
must find refuge first.

19
00:02:21,794 --> 00:02:25,462
I found a planet that's well hidden.
Earth.

20
00:02:25,464 --> 00:02:28,398
You will travel there and
establish a base for us.

21
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,201
Once we've gathered the
others, we'll join you.

22
00:02:31,203 --> 00:02:33,036
You must protect
the planet.

23
00:02:33,038 --> 00:02:38,076
If the Decepticons find it, then
our people are truly finished.

24
00:02:38,078 --> 00:02:39,445
Now go!

25
00:02:54,693 --> 00:02:58,030
Good luck, soldier.
I'll buy you some time.

26
00:04:01,328 --> 00:04:02,393
No!

27
00:04:02,395 --> 00:04:03,827
Ow! Ow! Ow!

28
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:04,695
Okay, okay!

29
00:04:04,697 --> 00:04:06,699
I'm dead already,
man!

30
00:04:07,866 --> 00:04:09,967
Oh, not just you.

31
00:04:09,969 --> 00:04:11,501
Being the overachiever
that you are,

32
00:04:11,503 --> 00:04:13,771
you managed to get your
whole squad killed, Danny.

33
00:04:13,773 --> 00:04:14,639
Bravo.

34
00:04:14,641 --> 00:04:15,873
Come on, man.
Those things sting.

35
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,842
- What things? These things?
- Ow!

36
00:04:17,844 --> 00:04:19,978
You know, I wouldn't know.
I haven't been hit yet.

37
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,546
Ow! Okay, you know what?
That's too close, man.

38
00:04:22,548 --> 00:04:23,881
You could've taken out an eye.

39
00:04:23,883 --> 00:04:26,250
I got a date tonight, man.
This ain't sexy!

40
00:04:26,252 --> 00:04:28,518
- You're right. I'm sorry.
- Ow!

41
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,820
That one was on me.

42
00:04:29,822 --> 00:04:31,788
That's a malfunctioning
trigger.

43
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:34,925
This weapon is just faulty. Someone
is going to get a talking to...

44
00:04:34,927 --> 00:04:36,093
Man, would you stop?

45
00:04:36,095 --> 00:04:37,931
All right, just stop.

46
00:04:39,132 --> 00:04:41,199
I should've
let you die in Grenada.

47
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:42,967
If you did, we wouldn't be
able to come to the forest,

48
00:04:42,969 --> 00:04:45,003
run around and play
these awesome games.

49
00:04:45,005 --> 00:04:46,204
Exactly.

50
00:04:47,474 --> 00:04:49,007
Oh, I hate you.

51
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:52,276
Wow, man, that hurts.
'Cause I love you.

52
00:04:52,278 --> 00:04:55,079
But you refuse to let it in
'cause you got intimacy issues.

53
00:04:55,081 --> 00:04:56,948
A therapist will probably tell you
you weren't hugged enough as a kid.

54
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,818
- Look, man.
- Danny, I know I look stupid, but...

55
00:05:01,188 --> 00:05:02,987
Hey, yo, take cover!

56
00:05:15,235 --> 00:05:17,103
Danny.

57
00:05:17,504 --> 00:05:19,170
You okay?

58
00:05:19,172 --> 00:05:20,907
Uh, yeah, man.

59
00:05:23,542 --> 00:05:25,411
This is Agent Jack Burns.

60
00:05:25,413 --> 00:05:27,312
I need medical
up here now.

61
00:05:27,314 --> 00:05:28,579
We have
a projectile strike

62
00:05:28,581 --> 00:05:30,615
in the northwest corner
of the training course.

63
00:05:30,617 --> 00:05:32,484
Multiple injuries.

64
00:05:32,486 --> 00:05:37,355
And would someone please explain to me
why you dropped napalm on your own guys!

65
00:05:37,357 --> 00:05:40,825
<i>Negative. There are no
live fire drills in the northwest sector.</i>

66
00:05:40,827 --> 00:05:42,829
What the hell hit us, then?

67
00:05:55,675 --> 00:05:57,143
Target on your right!

68
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:16,297
I need all of you to fan out
and track that thing down now!

69
00:06:19,433 --> 00:06:20,633
Drive!

70
00:06:27,173 --> 00:06:28,174
There!

71
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:33,044
What the hell?

72
00:06:33,046 --> 00:06:34,147
Take it down!

73
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:40,787
Get down there now
and flush that thing out!

74
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:42,922
There it is!

75
00:06:51,764 --> 00:06:53,867
<i>Target has been located, sir.</i>

76
00:06:55,335 --> 00:06:56,336
Light it up!

77
00:07:07,181 --> 00:07:08,182
Damn it!

78
00:07:19,292 --> 00:07:20,660
Oh, no.

79
00:07:31,804 --> 00:07:34,108
It's going for the mine!
Cut it off!

80
00:07:50,391 --> 00:07:52,024
Move, move!

81
00:08:04,837 --> 00:08:05,937
Please.

82
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:07,774
This is a mistake.

83
00:08:09,376 --> 00:08:11,376
Stay cool.
Hold your fire.

84
00:08:11,378 --> 00:08:13,312
I don't want
to hurt anyone.

85
00:08:20,854 --> 00:08:22,189
Who called in the Air Force?

86
00:08:26,427 --> 00:08:28,229
That's not the Air Force.

87
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:34,867
Run.

88
00:08:58,359 --> 00:09:00,124
Did you think you could hide?

89
00:09:09,704 --> 00:09:11,870
Now you'll die screaming.

90
00:09:11,872 --> 00:09:14,074
Like your friends!

91
00:09:49,177 --> 00:09:51,843
Tell me where
your friends are hiding.

92
00:09:51,845 --> 00:09:53,579
I'll never talk.

93
00:09:53,581 --> 00:09:55,317
Is that right?

94
00:09:57,184 --> 00:09:59,151
Then let's
make it official.

95
00:10:28,449 --> 00:10:30,783
B-127...

96
00:10:30,785 --> 00:10:33,318
As a member
of the Autobot resistance,

97
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,787
you are a traitor
to Cybertron

98
00:10:35,789 --> 00:10:38,291
and are hereby sentenced

99
00:10:38,293 --> 00:10:39,294
to death.

100
00:10:46,301 --> 00:10:47,302
No!

101
00:10:48,235 --> 00:10:49,371
No!

102
00:12:22,464 --> 00:12:23,565
Ugh.

103
00:12:24,432 --> 00:12:25,733
Shut up.

104
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,896
Morning, Dad.

105
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:38,170
No! Don't tickle.

106
00:13:38,172 --> 00:13:40,375
Ow!

107
00:13:42,877 --> 00:13:44,078
Uh-oh!

108
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:46,078
Caught.

109
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,348
Gross, Ron.

110
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,451
Excuse me.

111
00:13:51,287 --> 00:13:53,554
Are those
your diving trophies?

112
00:13:53,556 --> 00:13:55,354
Taking up too much space
in my room.

113
00:13:55,356 --> 00:13:57,358
You're gonna
regret doing that.

114
00:13:58,226 --> 00:13:59,760
Where's breakfast?

115
00:13:59,762 --> 00:14:03,964
Breakfast is conveniently located
in the cupboards and the fridge.

116
00:14:03,966 --> 00:14:05,064
- Ah.
- Try to help out...

117
00:14:05,066 --> 00:14:06,699
- Yeah.
- ...a little.

118
00:14:06,701 --> 00:14:09,769
Since I'm such a big kid now, making
my own breakfast and what have you,

119
00:14:09,771 --> 00:14:13,707
you know how I could be an even
bigger help around here, Mom?

120
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:15,042
If I had a car.

121
00:14:15,044 --> 00:14:16,175
Charlie.

122
00:14:16,177 --> 00:14:17,978
What do you know,
it's my birthday tomorrow,

123
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,380
perfect timing
for a large cash gift.

124
00:14:20,382 --> 00:14:22,816
You know, $500 is really all
I need to finish the Corvette.

125
00:14:22,818 --> 00:14:27,253
I don't have $500. You
know how much nurses make.

126
00:14:27,255 --> 00:14:29,823
"Half as much as doctors
for twice the work," right?

127
00:14:29,825 --> 00:14:31,123
Tell you what, kiddo...

128
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,592
I got another
job interview tomorrow.

129
00:14:32,594 --> 00:14:35,028
If all goes well, I'll have
you swimming in car parts.

130
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,797
I prefer cash, Ron.

131
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,632
Don't be rude.
Feed the dog.

132
00:14:38,634 --> 00:14:41,068
Conan is Otis's dog.
Make him do it.

133
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:42,436
What?

134
00:14:42,438 --> 00:14:46,172
Aw! You look so grown
up in your karate suit.

135
00:14:46,174 --> 00:14:49,143
My baby boy
is becoming a man.

136
00:14:49,945 --> 00:14:51,545
Oh, shoot,
I'm gonna be late.

137
00:14:51,547 --> 00:14:55,214
Can you drop your brother at
karate on your way to work, please?

138
00:14:55,216 --> 00:14:57,050
Um, I could if I had a car.

139
00:14:57,052 --> 00:15:00,687
Just let him follow you on your
bike so nobody abducts him.

140
00:15:00,689 --> 00:15:03,824
Abducts him? You just
said he's a grown man now.

141
00:15:03,826 --> 00:15:07,496
If anyone tries anything, I will
rupture their freaking spleen.

142
00:15:41,096 --> 00:15:43,030
- That's two for you guys.
- Thanks, bro.

143
00:15:43,032 --> 00:15:45,264
All right.
Have a good one.

144
00:15:45,266 --> 00:15:46,902
Eat safe.

145
00:15:54,243 --> 00:15:56,176
Excuse me. Hi.
We've never actually met...

146
00:15:56,178 --> 00:15:57,511
Sorry, I can't right now.

147
00:15:57,513 --> 00:15:59,648
Yeah. Oh, okay.

148
00:16:00,716 --> 00:16:02,949
- Whoo!
- Hey, hot dog girl!

149
00:16:02,951 --> 00:16:04,951
Oh, my God!

150
00:16:04,953 --> 00:16:08,488
I'm so sorry.
Oh, God.

151
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:11,158
Someone's getting fired.

152
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,594
If I had to wear that,
I would pray to be fired.

153
00:16:14,596 --> 00:16:15,597
Good one, Tina.

154
00:16:19,635 --> 00:16:20,636
Let's go.

155
00:16:22,638 --> 00:16:23,704
Oops.

156
00:16:23,706 --> 00:16:24,707
Ooh.

157
00:16:58,707 --> 00:17:00,174
Come on.

158
00:17:00,176 --> 00:17:01,308
Hey, Uncle Hank.

159
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,845
Are you still working
on that damn car?

160
00:17:03,847 --> 00:17:05,849
You still working
on that damn personality?

161
00:17:07,516 --> 00:17:09,851
- What have you got for me?
- Whatever you want.

162
00:17:09,853 --> 00:17:12,786
Russians are gonna
blow us all to hell anyway.

163
00:17:12,788 --> 00:17:14,289
That's the spirit.

164
00:17:14,723 --> 00:17:16,556
Hey, kid.

165
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:17,958
Hand me the three-eighths,
would you?

166
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,596
- You working on the carburetor?
- Mmm-hmm.

167
00:17:23,766 --> 00:17:26,803
- You need the half-inch.
- I said the three...

168
00:17:27,137 --> 00:17:28,437
Huh.

169
00:17:30,272 --> 00:17:32,274
- Thanks, kid.
- Yep.

170
00:19:25,722 --> 00:19:28,522
Where is Optimus Prime?

171
00:19:28,524 --> 00:19:30,725
He survived the fall
of Cybertron.

172
00:19:30,727 --> 00:19:32,760
And no rebellion
is truly dead

173
00:19:32,762 --> 00:19:35,029
until the leader
is vanquished.

174
00:19:35,031 --> 00:19:37,632
So where is he?

175
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:41,636
My name is Cliffjumper, lieutenant
in the Autobot resistance.

176
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:44,105
My safe return will be considered...

177
00:19:44,107 --> 00:19:45,773
Wrong answer.

178
00:19:45,775 --> 00:19:49,111
We know he's planning to establish a base.

179
00:19:49,113 --> 00:19:52,014
Tell us where it is
and we'll let you live.

180
00:19:52,016 --> 00:19:55,250
My name is Cliffjumper,
lieutenant...

181
00:19:59,555 --> 00:20:01,222
No.

182
00:20:01,224 --> 00:20:03,424
That's B-127's signal.

183
00:20:03,426 --> 00:20:06,894
- Can you trace it?
- Already did.

184
00:20:06,896 --> 00:20:11,732
If you won't tell us where Prime
is, perhaps your young friend will.

185
00:20:11,734 --> 00:20:12,801
Never.

186
00:20:12,803 --> 00:20:17,406
You're a brave warrior.
You deserve a better death.

187
00:20:17,408 --> 00:20:19,274
But then again...

188
00:20:25,148 --> 00:20:27,617
Set course for Earth.

189
00:20:39,595 --> 00:20:41,063
I'll give you thirty bucks
for all of it.

190
00:20:41,065 --> 00:20:44,132
I can get twice
that much for the coil alone.

191
00:20:44,134 --> 00:20:46,401
From who? I'm the only one
that comes in here.

192
00:20:46,403 --> 00:20:47,969
I don't even know
how you're still open.

193
00:20:47,971 --> 00:20:50,606
Just take it. Go.
My show is on.

194
00:20:52,775 --> 00:20:54,809
Hey, where did you
get that Beetle?

195
00:20:54,811 --> 00:20:58,446
I swear to God, ever since
they put up that dumbass tower,

196
00:20:58,448 --> 00:21:00,916
I can't get a signal
to watch my shows.

197
00:21:00,918 --> 00:21:03,253
I've got to see what happens
to Alf this week.

198
00:21:14,298 --> 00:21:15,663
Come on!

199
00:21:30,214 --> 00:21:31,612
Are you kidding me?

200
00:21:36,453 --> 00:21:37,920
Damn it.

201
00:21:43,526 --> 00:21:45,028
I give up.

202
00:21:46,662 --> 00:21:50,365
I can't do this without you.

203
00:21:50,367 --> 00:21:54,169
<i>Nice to meet you.
Interested in a new Buick?</i>

204
00:21:54,171 --> 00:21:57,638
<i>- Nice try.
- All right, I touched. But I didn't eat.</i>

205
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,673
<i>And I'm supposed to
believe one of these steaks</i>

206
00:21:59,675 --> 00:22:01,709
<i>just got up and walked away
on its own?</i>

207
00:22:01,711 --> 00:22:04,312
<i>I've seen stranger.</i>

208
00:22:04,314 --> 00:22:05,780
<i>No dinner
for you tonight.</i>

209
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:10,117
<i>But I'm starved!
I've been fasting since lunch!</i>

210
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,791
<i>Well,
I did eat that pumpkin.</i>

211
00:22:34,111 --> 00:22:35,712
Happy birthday.

212
00:22:48,591 --> 00:22:50,127
I miss you, Dad.

213
00:22:51,594 --> 00:22:53,462
I think it's too low, honey.

214
00:22:53,464 --> 00:22:54,529
No.

215
00:22:54,531 --> 00:22:56,630
No, I think it goes
to that button.

216
00:22:56,632 --> 00:22:57,698
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

217
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,470
I don't know about...
Fix it.

218
00:23:00,472 --> 00:23:01,537
Hey.

219
00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:04,139
- Good morning, birthday girl!
- Hi.

220
00:23:04,141 --> 00:23:05,609
You look...

221
00:23:07,378 --> 00:23:08,378
Nice.

222
00:23:09,481 --> 00:23:11,012
Happy birthday, baby.

223
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:14,051
I love you. Come on, open your present.
I'm gonna be late for work.

224
00:23:15,651 --> 00:23:17,121
Thanks, Mom.

225
00:23:21,558 --> 00:23:23,293
Helmet. With...

226
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:25,161
Daffodils.

227
00:23:25,163 --> 00:23:26,895
So, I keep hearing

228
00:23:26,897 --> 00:23:30,899
about people on mopeds getting run
over and their brains smashed in.

229
00:23:30,901 --> 00:23:32,701
You got to wear this
from now on.

230
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:35,670
I don't care if it's not
the law. It's our law.

231
00:23:35,672 --> 00:23:37,741
Plus, look how cute it is.

232
00:23:40,077 --> 00:23:41,143
Yeah.

233
00:23:41,145 --> 00:23:42,711
Happy birthday.

234
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:45,013
I actually got you
a little gift, too, Charlie.

235
00:23:45,015 --> 00:23:48,086
I mean, it's small,
but, it's from the heart.

236
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,693
A smile is a powerful thing.

237
00:23:57,694 --> 00:23:59,227
It releases endorphins.

238
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:02,432
It says to the world,
"I'm fun and approachable."

239
00:24:04,468 --> 00:24:08,870
You know, there's a whole chapter in here
about how people who smile more often

240
00:24:08,872 --> 00:24:10,673
actually have more friends.

241
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:12,842
That's unbelievable.

242
00:24:12,844 --> 00:24:14,809
I really think it's gonna
change your whole outlook

243
00:24:14,811 --> 00:24:16,080
if you smile more often.

244
00:24:33,497 --> 00:24:34,965
I want the Beetle.

245
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,067
- What?
- The yellow Beetle, I want it.

246
00:24:38,069 --> 00:24:40,303
I'll make you a deal. If I get
that thing started, it's mine.

247
00:24:40,305 --> 00:24:43,239
That's no deal. That's
just you taking my car.

248
00:24:43,241 --> 00:24:47,243
If I get it started, I keep it and
I work here every day for a year!

249
00:24:47,245 --> 00:24:49,378
I'll scrub the grease
off the floors, okay?

250
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,481
I will pick up and organize every
scrap of paper in this place.

251
00:24:52,483 --> 00:24:56,220
I'll even detail your
horrible, disgusting toilets.

252
00:24:58,422 --> 00:25:00,391
Please.
It's my birthday.

253
00:25:01,226 --> 00:25:02,493
Sorry, no deal.

254
00:25:03,727 --> 00:25:05,729
'Cause we ain't hiring.

255
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:09,267
It's yours, kid.
Happy birthday.

256
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:13,371
Thank you.

257
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,673
Thank you,
thank you, thank you!

258
00:25:17,675 --> 00:25:19,810
And my toilets are gorgeous.

259
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,242
Oh, God, please.

260
00:25:54,112 --> 00:25:55,513
Come on.

261
00:25:59,783 --> 00:26:01,117
Oh, my...

262
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:03,119
Oh, my God!

263
00:26:03,121 --> 00:26:06,023
Oh, my God, thank you so much!
I love you!

264
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:16,034
- That thing ain't even safe to drive.
- It's a deathtrap.

265
00:26:19,904 --> 00:26:21,537
She's happy, though.

266
00:26:42,761 --> 00:26:44,028
Man.

267
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:46,130
Looks amazing.

268
00:26:58,343 --> 00:26:59,611
What?

269
00:27:56,402 --> 00:27:57,868
Oh, my God.

270
00:28:21,894 --> 00:28:23,460
Charlie,
what was that noise?

271
00:28:23,462 --> 00:28:25,695
Nothing! I'm fine. Mom, you should
go back to bed. Everything's fine.

272
00:28:25,697 --> 00:28:28,431
- What the hell is that?
- Um, it's...

273
00:28:28,433 --> 00:28:31,600
What is that car doing
in our garage?

274
00:28:31,602 --> 00:28:32,704
Car?

275
00:28:33,938 --> 00:28:36,475
Oh, that, uh, car

276
00:28:37,643 --> 00:28:39,209
is my car.

277
00:28:39,211 --> 00:28:41,178
Uncle Hank gave it to me.

278
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,413
- It runs.
- Yeah.

279
00:28:43,415 --> 00:28:45,014
Those aren't safe.

280
00:28:45,016 --> 00:28:47,551
I wish you would've told me
before you brought it home.

281
00:28:47,553 --> 00:28:49,287
Okay. Sorry.

282
00:28:50,221 --> 00:28:51,755
Um, I'm in the middle
of some stuff, Mom.

283
00:28:51,757 --> 00:28:54,758
Okay, I'll get out
of your hair, but...

284
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,593
Tell me things sometime.

285
00:28:57,595 --> 00:28:59,197
- I'm your mother.
- Okay.

286
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:01,064
Okay.

287
00:29:01,066 --> 00:29:02,232
Good night.

288
00:29:02,234 --> 00:29:05,302
- It really runs?
- Yeah, it really runs.

289
00:29:05,304 --> 00:29:06,305
Cool.

290
00:29:17,248 --> 00:29:18,915
You still in there?

291
00:29:22,654 --> 00:29:23,987
Okay.

292
00:29:23,989 --> 00:29:26,058
A little jumpy. I'm sorry.

293
00:29:36,468 --> 00:29:37,469
Okay.

294
00:30:02,961 --> 00:30:04,161
Hi.

295
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:18,610
Oh, God, are you...

296
00:30:21,513 --> 00:30:23,115
Do you speak?

297
00:30:35,595 --> 00:30:37,062
I won't hurt you.

298
00:31:02,622 --> 00:31:04,591
Can you understand me?

299
00:31:09,896 --> 00:31:11,463
What are you?

300
00:31:13,098 --> 00:31:14,766
Where did you come from?

301
00:31:15,969 --> 00:31:17,667
Okay. It's okay.

302
00:31:26,746 --> 00:31:28,246
You like my shirt?

303
00:31:28,948 --> 00:31:30,382
You a metal fan?

304
00:31:31,017 --> 00:31:32,284
No, wait...

305
00:31:33,019 --> 00:31:34,754
Oh, who? Me?

306
00:31:35,822 --> 00:31:37,189
Who am I?

307
00:31:38,891 --> 00:31:40,192
Oh, I'm...

308
00:31:41,426 --> 00:31:42,694
Charlie.

309
00:31:43,829 --> 00:31:45,428
Charlie Watson.

310
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,300
I'm 18.

311
00:31:47,834 --> 00:31:49,300
Today.

312
00:31:49,302 --> 00:31:51,471
Actually, it's
my birthday today.

313
00:31:53,573 --> 00:31:54,707
What's your name?

314
00:31:58,111 --> 00:32:00,579
You don't know
or you don't have a name?

315
00:32:05,384 --> 00:32:07,619
You sound like
a little bumblebee.

316
00:32:10,455 --> 00:32:12,659
I'm gonna call you that
from now on.

317
00:32:15,595 --> 00:32:16,696
Bumblebee.

318
00:32:18,731 --> 00:32:20,230
Matches your outfit, too.

319
00:32:46,893 --> 00:32:48,426
I want a divorce, Roy!

320
00:32:48,428 --> 00:32:50,594
Come on, Amber.
Give me one good reason.

321
00:32:50,596 --> 00:32:52,730
You tried to sleep
with my sister!

322
00:32:52,732 --> 00:32:54,131
Unsuccessfully!

323
00:32:54,133 --> 00:32:56,599
Yeah, you're unsuccessful
at everything.

324
00:32:56,601 --> 00:32:59,270
That down payment was for a house.
You bought a car.

325
00:32:59,272 --> 00:33:02,807
How stupid are you, Roy?
We don't need a car. God!

326
00:33:02,809 --> 00:33:06,412
Now, just settle down for
one second and hear me out.

327
00:33:08,247 --> 00:33:10,950
- What the hell is that?
- What?

328
00:33:13,853 --> 00:33:16,954
Oh, God, Roy, that thing
is coming right for us!

329
00:33:16,956 --> 00:33:18,756
No, no, no, no, no...

330
00:33:18,758 --> 00:33:20,557
Not my car. Not my car.

331
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,895
Please, God, no, not my car!

332
00:33:33,873 --> 00:33:35,875
Oh, thank God, my car.

333
00:33:36,676 --> 00:33:38,309
Yeah, I'm okay.

334
00:33:38,311 --> 00:33:41,379
Oh, that's good, baby.
That's good.

335
00:33:42,347 --> 00:33:43,983
Run. Run!

336
00:33:55,996 --> 00:33:57,263
Oh...

337
00:33:59,398 --> 00:34:01,901
God!

338
00:34:03,336 --> 00:34:04,804
Is that my car?

339
00:34:07,774 --> 00:34:08,841
Hello...

340
00:34:23,223 --> 00:34:24,321
Jeez!

341
00:34:24,323 --> 00:34:25,856
Earth.

342
00:34:25,858 --> 00:34:27,792
- Roy!
- Oh!

343
00:34:27,794 --> 00:34:29,193
How underwhelming.

344
00:34:29,195 --> 00:34:32,732
The indigenous life is even
more primitive than I expected.

345
00:34:34,534 --> 00:34:35,667
Hey...

346
00:34:38,538 --> 00:34:41,072
Hmm. I like
the way they pop.

347
00:34:41,074 --> 00:34:42,673
Focus, comrade.

348
00:34:42,675 --> 00:34:48,079
B-127's distress signal came from
the western coast of this continent.

349
00:34:48,081 --> 00:34:50,817
For now, we head west.

350
00:35:04,932 --> 00:35:07,331
When do they start
letting you use nunchucks?

351
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:08,800
I don't know,
but I hope soon.

352
00:35:08,802 --> 00:35:11,604
- Morning! See you guys later.
- Where you off to so fast?

353
00:35:12,471 --> 00:35:14,674
Nowhere. Have a nice day.

354
00:35:16,843 --> 00:35:18,077
Morning...

355
00:35:20,646 --> 00:35:21,747
Bee?

356
00:35:24,418 --> 00:35:26,084
Bee, where are you?

357
00:35:28,889 --> 00:35:31,256
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

358
00:35:31,258 --> 00:35:32,324
Bee!

359
00:35:32,326 --> 00:35:33,994
Where did you go?

360
00:35:39,799 --> 00:35:41,498
Otis!

361
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,400
Have you seen my car?

362
00:35:43,402 --> 00:35:44,602
Unfortunately, yes.

363
00:35:44,604 --> 00:35:46,704
No, have you seen
my car today?

364
00:35:46,706 --> 00:35:49,007
It was in the garage.
Someone stole it!

365
00:35:49,009 --> 00:35:50,675
No, idiot. Mom took it.

366
00:35:50,677 --> 00:35:52,143
She had to bring Conan to the vet

367
00:35:52,145 --> 00:35:54,246
because he swallowed, like,
a rubber glove or something

368
00:35:54,248 --> 00:35:56,114
and Ron needed
the station wagon.

369
00:35:56,116 --> 00:35:57,550
Thank God.

370
00:36:00,087 --> 00:36:01,420
Wait.

371
00:36:06,826 --> 00:36:08,959
Hi. Excuse me.
It's me again.

372
00:36:08,961 --> 00:36:11,230
- We never officially met, but...
- I can't right now. Sorry.

373
00:36:11,232 --> 00:36:12,898
Nope. Yep.

374
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,399
Okay.

375
00:36:18,038 --> 00:36:19,907
I know, buddy. Hang in there.

376
00:36:22,376 --> 00:36:24,575
You can't eat
everything you see.

377
00:36:24,577 --> 00:36:27,713
Just let this be
a good life lesson for you.

378
00:36:29,615 --> 00:36:32,585
Oh, my God. Stop it!
Don't do that!

379
00:36:37,057 --> 00:36:38,058
Bee, no!

380
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:44,831
- Mom?
- Whoa!

381
00:36:45,699 --> 00:36:48,199
Jesus! Charlie,
what are you doing?

382
00:36:48,201 --> 00:36:49,533
Mom, you gotta pull over.

383
00:36:49,535 --> 00:36:52,503
- What the hell is going on?
- Just pull the car over.

384
00:36:52,505 --> 00:36:55,441
Okay, okay. All right.

385
00:36:58,011 --> 00:37:01,980
Would you put that robot junk away?
What are you thinking?

386
00:37:01,982 --> 00:37:03,581
You almost gave me
a heart attack.

387
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:05,083
I thought
I was being carjacked.

388
00:37:05,085 --> 00:37:06,685
I'm taking the dog to the vet.

389
00:37:06,687 --> 00:37:10,755
I can't believe you would take him
without me. Mom, I'm so worried about him!

390
00:37:10,757 --> 00:37:12,524
He's my dog, too, you know.

391
00:37:12,526 --> 00:37:15,126
What happened to Conan
being Otis's dog?

392
00:37:15,128 --> 00:37:17,028
Mom, you're
being hysterical, okay?

393
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:19,331
You should not be driving
in such an emotional state.

394
00:37:19,333 --> 00:37:21,168
I know how you get
during emergencies.

395
00:37:22,035 --> 00:37:23,171
I'm a nurse.

396
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:26,506
Not of animals.

397
00:37:30,378 --> 00:37:34,012
Oh, okay. I'm happy
for you to drive.

398
00:37:34,014 --> 00:37:36,349
You weren't wearing
your helmet, by the way.

399
00:37:36,351 --> 00:37:37,918
- I saw that.
- Oh, shoot.

400
00:37:40,887 --> 00:37:42,420
Keep it together, Bee.

401
00:37:50,064 --> 00:37:51,065
Sir?

402
00:37:52,266 --> 00:37:53,466
Sir.

403
00:37:53,468 --> 00:37:55,869
I thought you'd want
to see this immediately.

404
00:38:00,807 --> 00:38:02,674
- They sure?
- Yes, sir.

405
00:38:02,676 --> 00:38:04,809
Two of them just
made contact in Texas.

406
00:38:04,811 --> 00:38:07,045
Intel says they're heading
west fast.

407
00:38:07,047 --> 00:38:08,648
Saddle up, Simmons.

408
00:38:09,483 --> 00:38:11,052
We're going to Texas.

409
00:38:12,887 --> 00:38:15,822
Okay, Bee, we need
to go over a few things.

410
00:38:21,728 --> 00:38:23,597
Okay. We're all clear.

411
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:29,167
All right.
I'm re-thinking the beach.

412
00:38:29,169 --> 00:38:30,170
Ugh.

413
00:38:31,605 --> 00:38:33,605
Oh, I'm good.

414
00:38:33,607 --> 00:38:35,209
No, I'm good, thanks.

415
00:38:37,278 --> 00:38:41,147
People can be terrible about
things they don't understand.

416
00:38:41,149 --> 00:38:43,848
If they find you, they'll probably
lock you up in a lab somewhere

417
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:45,550
and cut you
into tiny little pieces.

418
00:38:45,552 --> 00:38:48,622
It'll be bad, trust me.

419
00:38:51,925 --> 00:38:55,862
The only person you can show
yourself around is me, okay?

420
00:38:57,931 --> 00:39:00,132
So let's practice.
You ready?

421
00:39:00,134 --> 00:39:02,203
If you see anyone besides me,
what do you do?

422
00:39:05,473 --> 00:39:07,808
Great. Perfect.
Come back now.

423
00:39:09,876 --> 00:39:12,744
Okay, so let's say we're
driving and all of a sudden...

424
00:39:12,746 --> 00:39:15,283
Oh, shoot! Somebody's here!
Hide, Bee, hide!

425
00:39:27,695 --> 00:39:29,163
You serious?

426
00:39:33,101 --> 00:39:35,635
Bee, it's too late.
You're already dead.

427
00:39:39,507 --> 00:39:40,905
It's all right.

428
00:39:40,907 --> 00:39:44,843
That's why we're practicing.
You'll get it.

429
00:39:44,845 --> 00:39:48,649
<i>Fox-2 on approach.
Non-biologicals are inbound.</i>

430
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:09,067
The goal, sir, should be
to communicate with them.

431
00:40:09,069 --> 00:40:12,671
First contact
with an alien species.

432
00:40:12,673 --> 00:40:15,741
I've spent my whole life
waiting for this moment.

433
00:40:15,743 --> 00:40:18,946
If they make one wrong move,
we put 'em down.

434
00:40:34,095 --> 00:40:37,564
The humans are multiplying.
Please let me kill them.

435
00:40:37,566 --> 00:40:41,169
Not yet. B-127's
signal has gone silent.

436
00:40:42,303 --> 00:40:44,038
I have an idea.

437
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:48,941
Listen up! I'm Agent Burns
and this is Dr. Powell.

438
00:40:48,943 --> 00:40:52,744
We currently have 100 guns
pointed right at your head!

439
00:40:52,746 --> 00:40:54,647
So state your business.

440
00:40:54,649 --> 00:40:56,515
People of Earth,

441
00:40:56,517 --> 00:41:00,719
we are Decepticon peacekeepers
patrolling the galaxy.

442
00:41:00,721 --> 00:41:02,656
What are you doing?

443
00:41:02,658 --> 00:41:04,723
This is humiliating.

444
00:41:04,725 --> 00:41:07,860
We believe a dangerous
criminal from our world

445
00:41:07,862 --> 00:41:10,996
is hiding somewhere
on yours.

446
00:41:10,998 --> 00:41:12,867
How is it you think
we can help?

447
00:41:14,402 --> 00:41:16,804
We need your eyes.

448
00:41:17,471 --> 00:41:18,804
Wait.

449
00:41:18,806 --> 00:41:21,073
You want access
to our satellites?

450
00:41:21,075 --> 00:41:23,742
Our scanners'
range is limited.

451
00:41:23,744 --> 00:41:27,079
Your infrastructure
is primitive.

452
00:41:27,081 --> 00:41:30,950
But combined, they
could be quite powerful.

453
00:41:30,952 --> 00:41:32,586
No way!
Out of the question!

454
00:41:32,588 --> 00:41:35,555
We have a common enemy,
Agent Burns.

455
00:41:35,557 --> 00:41:37,890
There's a war raging
on our planet.

456
00:41:37,892 --> 00:41:42,696
If B-127 isn't found, that
war may find its way here.

457
00:41:42,698 --> 00:41:44,830
Perhaps...

458
00:41:44,832 --> 00:41:48,034
We can find a way
to help one another.

459
00:41:48,036 --> 00:41:49,935
We'll talk it over
with our superiors.

460
00:41:49,937 --> 00:41:52,972
In the meantime,
if you could follow us.

461
00:41:52,974 --> 00:41:55,642
Very well,
friend Powell.

462
00:41:55,644 --> 00:41:57,479
Take us to your leader.

463
00:42:08,122 --> 00:42:11,126
Must suck being
cooped up in a VW all day, huh?

464
00:42:12,661 --> 00:42:14,995
Is there anyone
that can help you?

465
00:42:14,997 --> 00:42:16,630
Do you have a family?

466
00:42:16,632 --> 00:42:19,733
You know, like a mom,
dad, siblings?

467
00:42:19,735 --> 00:42:21,135
You all love each other?

468
00:42:23,672 --> 00:42:25,104
Or drive each other crazy

469
00:42:25,106 --> 00:42:27,942
and you can't wait to get away
and start a whole new life.

470
00:42:34,015 --> 00:42:35,951
Do you want me
to see if I can fix it?

471
00:42:38,053 --> 00:42:39,888
I'll be gentle, I promise.

472
00:42:49,765 --> 00:42:50,963
Whoa.

473
00:42:54,636 --> 00:42:56,203
You lay down, okay?

474
00:42:59,742 --> 00:43:01,076
Hold still.

475
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,547
I think maybe
there's something...

476
00:43:17,258 --> 00:43:22,862
<i>B-127,
I pray this message finds you.</i>

477
00:43:22,864 --> 00:43:26,433
<i>Our war rages on.</i>

478
00:43:26,435 --> 00:43:27,903
<i>...planet Earth...</i>

479
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:30,272
<i>...survival...</i>

480
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:57,966
Ravage, eject!

481
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:17,384
<i>...your mission...</i>

482
00:44:17,386 --> 00:44:18,719
<i>...soldier...</i>

483
00:44:18,721 --> 00:44:19,988
<i>I...</i>

484
00:44:24,326 --> 00:44:25,692
Are you okay?

485
00:44:28,697 --> 00:44:30,330
Who was that?

486
00:44:30,332 --> 00:44:33,335
That voice said something
about a war.

487
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:36,271
Do you remember anything?

488
00:44:39,809 --> 00:44:43,679
Is the VW Beetle
some kind of disguise?

489
00:44:45,147 --> 00:44:47,082
Are you hiding
from something?

490
00:44:50,085 --> 00:44:51,453
Are you scared?

491
00:45:04,065 --> 00:45:05,401
It's broken.

492
00:45:07,603 --> 00:45:08,968
It's okay.

493
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:11,037
I think I can help.

494
00:45:12,574 --> 00:45:14,009
Let's go home.

495
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,780
<i>...and a basket case,</i>

496
00:45:20,782 --> 00:45:22,383
<i>a princess...</i>

497
00:45:22,385 --> 00:45:24,185
<i>- And a criminal.</i>
- All right, I'm almost done.

498
00:45:24,187 --> 00:45:25,987
<i>Does that
answer your question?</i>

499
00:45:26,522 --> 00:45:27,588
No way.

500
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:28,756
Are you actually
watching it?

501
00:45:32,994 --> 00:45:35,063
You can pop in another one
if you want.

502
00:45:44,406 --> 00:45:46,576
<i>Whoo! Come on, sweetie!</i>

503
00:45:47,643 --> 00:45:49,445
<i>You got this, Charlie girl!</i>

504
00:45:53,282 --> 00:45:54,849
<i>All right, Charlie girl!</i>

505
00:45:56,619 --> 00:45:57,885
<i>Hello, Brighton Falls.</i>

506
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:59,753
<i>This is Charlie Watson,
future Olympic gold medalist.</i>

507
00:45:59,755 --> 00:46:01,154
<i>That was so perfect.</i>

508
00:46:01,156 --> 00:46:03,156
<i>- Thanks, Dad.
- How do you feel?</i>

509
00:46:03,158 --> 00:46:05,160
No, no,
why would you play this?

510
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:10,466
Sorry. I just...

511
00:46:11,501 --> 00:46:12,602
I finished.

512
00:46:17,306 --> 00:46:19,242
Let's see
if we got something.

513
00:46:22,378 --> 00:46:23,513
Okay.

514
00:46:32,922 --> 00:46:34,257
Okay.

515
00:46:34,992 --> 00:46:36,459
All right.

516
00:46:42,398 --> 00:46:44,465
Oh, my God, yes!

517
00:46:44,467 --> 00:46:45,801
It worked!

518
00:46:46,569 --> 00:46:48,702
Look at you go.

519
00:46:48,704 --> 00:46:50,905
You got some moves.

520
00:46:57,646 --> 00:47:01,348
You know, Bee, music can
help you say what you're feeling.

521
00:47:04,687 --> 00:47:07,721
You're gonna love this.
It's brand new.

522
00:47:21,771 --> 00:47:23,205
Not a Smiths fan.

523
00:47:24,407 --> 00:47:25,641
Okay, um...

524
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:28,210
Here.

525
00:47:28,744 --> 00:47:30,344
Try this.

526
00:47:37,019 --> 00:47:38,387
Fine.

527
00:47:40,456 --> 00:47:42,525
Okay, where's my
Stevie Nicks?

528
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,163
Joan Jett and the Blackhearts.

529
00:47:48,397 --> 00:47:50,331
Stones.

530
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:52,869
Hey, hey, please don't touch those.
Please.

531
00:47:58,374 --> 00:48:00,610
They belonged to my dad.

532
00:48:19,295 --> 00:48:20,696
Do you want to hear it?

533
00:48:42,953 --> 00:48:45,686
We used to listen to this while
we'd work on the Corvette.

534
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:52,693
It was his favorite.

535
00:48:56,632 --> 00:48:59,569
He used to say it would
make the car feel better.

536
00:49:10,613 --> 00:49:13,447
We used to work on this car
every weekend together.

537
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,920
It was our thing.

538
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:26,363
That tape...

539
00:49:30,332 --> 00:49:32,401
That was the last time
I saw him.

540
00:49:36,439 --> 00:49:38,374
He died of a heart attack.

541
00:49:40,509 --> 00:49:42,545
I never got
to say goodbye.

542
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:48,852
You know, I always
thought if I could just

543
00:49:49,886 --> 00:49:52,422
finish fixing this car...

544
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:59,228
If I could just get it
to start up again,

545
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:02,331
he would hear me.

546
00:50:04,734 --> 00:50:06,435
He would hear me.

547
00:50:44,674 --> 00:50:46,941
I say this
with all due respect.

548
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:48,543
Have you lost your damn mind?

549
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:51,246
- That was with all due respect?
- The man's got a point, Doctor.

550
00:50:51,248 --> 00:50:54,983
Our satellite network is at the
forefront of our national defense.

551
00:50:54,985 --> 00:50:58,888
Sir, please. It could be a
once in a lifetime opportunity.

552
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:02,590
Can you imagine the advances an alliance
with these creatures might bring?

553
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:05,894
I imagine the advances.
An advance on Washington.

554
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:08,730
- New York. An advance on Chicago!
- That's not gonna happen.

555
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,533
They literally call
themselves "Decepticons."

556
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:13,168
That doesn't set off
any red flags?

557
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:15,904
Enough! From both of you.

558
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,304
Sir,

559
00:51:17,306 --> 00:51:21,610
we're talking about the most
advanced robotic system ever seen.

560
00:51:22,113 --> 00:51:23,711
If we tell them no,

561
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:27,216
they'll just take their technology
to the Russians instead.

562
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:32,687
Do you really want to go down in history
as the man who cost us the Cold War?

563
00:51:35,058 --> 00:51:36,092
Fine.

564
00:51:37,093 --> 00:51:39,696
We'll help them
find their fugitive.

565
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:41,896
And when it's done,

566
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:44,034
you can do all the
experiments you want. Hmm?

567
00:51:47,171 --> 00:51:48,371
Yes, sir.

568
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:52,509
Gentle... Uh, Robots.

569
00:51:54,312 --> 00:51:56,511
Welcome to Sector 7.

570
00:51:56,513 --> 00:51:59,614
How kind of you
to finally allow us in.

571
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:02,584
We're very happy
to have you here as friends.

572
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:04,452
Thank you, friend Powell.

573
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:08,790
My superior has agreed to grant you
limited access to our satellites.

574
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:13,996
In addition, you're welcome to
use all of our technology here.

575
00:52:13,998 --> 00:52:17,199
It's the largest super-array
of Crays on Earth.

576
00:52:17,201 --> 00:52:19,634
We thank you
for your hospitality.

577
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:24,572
Tell me, those vocal
communication devices you use,

578
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:26,541
do they function worldwide?

579
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:29,479
The telephones? Yes, why?

580
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:36,785
You got to pick
a station, man.

581
00:52:36,787 --> 00:52:38,453
I know there's
a lot of choices.

582
00:52:38,455 --> 00:52:40,289
"You want to go
on a date with me, maybe?"

583
00:52:42,026 --> 00:52:43,192
Okay, uh...

584
00:52:45,129 --> 00:52:46,594
What are you trying to do?

585
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:48,364
Here we go. Here we go.

586
00:52:48,366 --> 00:52:50,798
You're not a nerd. You're not a nerd.
You're not a nerd. You're not a nerd.

587
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,468
Okay, you're a nerd, but just don't
let her see that you're nerdy.

588
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:55,837
Excuse me. Sorry to barge in.
I just...

589
00:52:58,342 --> 00:53:00,142
Um...

590
00:53:00,144 --> 00:53:01,343
Do you, just...

591
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:03,444
No, no,
it's fine! Just...

592
00:53:03,446 --> 00:53:06,882
Just sit down, please?
Shh, don't scream, okay?

593
00:53:06,884 --> 00:53:08,350
What is that?

594
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:10,685
It's okay, okay?
Just breathe. Breathe.

595
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:13,090
- First of all, hi.
- Hi.

596
00:53:13,991 --> 00:53:15,456
I'm Charlie.

597
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:17,059
I'm Memo, hi.

598
00:53:17,061 --> 00:53:18,929
Hi, Memo. Um...

599
00:53:20,063 --> 00:53:21,696
It's nice to meet you.

600
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:23,232
Pleasure... Pleasure...

601
00:53:23,234 --> 00:53:26,904
Look, I know what you saw was
a little crazy. I can explain.

602
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:30,639
Yeah, I can't explain.
But here's the deal.

603
00:53:30,641 --> 00:53:32,374
If you tell anyone
what you just saw,

604
00:53:32,376 --> 00:53:34,444
I'm gonna have to
run you over with my car.

605
00:53:36,847 --> 00:53:37,913
Jeez.

606
00:53:37,915 --> 00:53:39,248
That was...

607
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:40,515
I don't mean that
in a mean way.

608
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:42,117
Okay? What I'm saying

609
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:45,890
is no one can know
what you just saw, okay?

610
00:53:47,925 --> 00:53:49,060
You promise?

611
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:51,794
Yeah.

612
00:53:51,796 --> 00:53:53,262
Okay.

613
00:53:53,264 --> 00:53:54,665
Okay.

614
00:53:57,735 --> 00:54:00,237
Bumblebee,
you can come out now.

615
00:54:07,345 --> 00:54:09,510
What?

616
00:54:09,512 --> 00:54:10,781
It's, uh...

617
00:54:11,316 --> 00:54:12,382
He.

618
00:54:12,384 --> 00:54:13,684
Wow.

619
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:22,492
He's been going up and down on that
dial all day today and I don't know why.

620
00:54:24,795 --> 00:54:26,931
- Hey, check out his reflexes.
- What?

621
00:54:27,932 --> 00:54:30,565
Oh! Oh, God!

622
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:32,134
- Yo, give me your shirt.
- Huh?

623
00:54:32,136 --> 00:54:33,435
Give me your shirt.

624
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:34,737
You mean the shirt
that I'm wearing?

625
00:54:34,739 --> 00:54:36,439
Yes, yes! Come on.
I'll give it back to you.

626
00:54:36,441 --> 00:54:37,673
Okay.

627
00:54:37,675 --> 00:54:40,077
Come on!
Give me your shirt!

628
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:47,151
All right.

629
00:54:52,589 --> 00:54:55,424
Wait, wait, wait! Hey, no, no!
You don't need to do this.

630
00:54:55,426 --> 00:54:57,826
- Yes, I do.
- No, but...

631
00:54:57,828 --> 00:55:00,763
- Come here. Come on!
- No, I get it. I get it!

632
00:55:00,765 --> 00:55:02,267
Whoo-hoo!

633
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,169
Oh.

634
00:55:07,905 --> 00:55:09,304
Sorry.

635
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:12,743
I know I promised you, but, yeah,
you're not getting that back.

636
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:35,264
It's incredible!

637
00:55:35,266 --> 00:55:38,801
They're combining
our technology seamlessly.

638
00:55:38,803 --> 00:55:41,336
Satellites, phones, computers.

639
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:45,909
<i>They're creating an
interconnected web of information.</i>

640
00:55:45,911 --> 00:55:48,677
Volumes of data
at their fingertips.

641
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:50,746
It's revolutionary.

642
00:55:50,748 --> 00:55:53,049
He's a weird guy. You ever
notice that about Powell?

643
00:55:53,051 --> 00:55:56,652
They're tracking
fluctuations in Energon levels.

644
00:55:56,654 --> 00:56:00,323
It's like a heat signature
specific to their species.

645
00:56:00,325 --> 00:56:01,723
<i>It's astonishing.</i>

646
00:56:01,725 --> 00:56:03,994
<i>It's beautiful. It's...</i>

647
00:56:04,429 --> 00:56:06,161
Hello? Hello?

648
00:56:06,163 --> 00:56:10,166
You've given them our satellites,
our comms, God knows what else.

649
00:56:10,168 --> 00:56:13,536
Yet in the space of a day
they've given us a way

650
00:56:13,538 --> 00:56:18,174
to not only hunt down B-127,
but all of them.

651
00:56:19,444 --> 00:56:23,679
Let them finish what they're doing.
Let them find B-127.

652
00:56:23,681 --> 00:56:26,682
And then I'll give you
permission to destroy them all.

653
00:56:26,684 --> 00:56:28,886
Use them for spare parts.

654
00:56:30,121 --> 00:56:31,590
Sir, yes, sir.

655
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:35,358
So you have no idea
where he came from?

656
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,860
No idea.

657
00:56:36,862 --> 00:56:38,828
You thought about
calling the cops?

658
00:56:40,031 --> 00:56:41,931
What are they
gonna do, Memo?

659
00:56:41,933 --> 00:56:45,602
They're just gonna send him away to a lab
and do weird science experiments on him.

660
00:56:49,608 --> 00:56:52,708
You're getting pretty good
with that radio dial, Bee.

661
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:55,144
Yeah, D.J. Bumble
in the house!

662
00:56:59,751 --> 00:57:02,252
Is that why you're always
messing with the dial?

663
00:57:02,254 --> 00:57:04,821
You're trying to teach
yourself how to talk, aren't you?

664
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:09,791
No way.

665
00:57:09,793 --> 00:57:12,428
Oh, my God, Bee, you're a genius!
You're an actual genius!

666
00:57:23,008 --> 00:57:26,009
- What is going on here?
- That's Jim from sixth period.

667
00:57:26,011 --> 00:57:28,912
He said
he was busy this week.

668
00:57:28,914 --> 00:57:30,916
You want
to check it out?

669
00:57:33,852 --> 00:57:36,519
- This is pretty cool.
- Okay.

670
00:57:36,521 --> 00:57:38,454
Bee, we'll be right back.

671
00:57:38,456 --> 00:57:40,822
Don't do anything crazy.

672
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:42,958
Hey, everybody, come watch!
Tripp's gonna jump!

673
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,594
You're off your nut.

674
00:57:44,596 --> 00:57:46,129
- What's going on over there?
- Don't do it, dude, you're crazy.

675
00:57:46,131 --> 00:57:47,797
Come on,
it's not that big a jump.

676
00:57:47,799 --> 00:57:49,799
God,
is that Tripp Summers?

677
00:57:49,801 --> 00:57:51,334
Oh, you know Tripp?

678
00:57:51,336 --> 00:57:54,204
I mean, yeah. I spilled a
gallon of lemonade on him once.

679
00:57:54,206 --> 00:57:57,809
Doesn't anyone have the balls
to jump off this thing with me?

680
00:57:59,945 --> 00:58:00,946
Ah!

681
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,546
A brave volunteer.

682
00:58:03,548 --> 00:58:06,148
Yeah, I... See, I didn't...
I didn't do that. I didn't actually...

683
00:58:16,094 --> 00:58:19,028
Hey, I know you.

684
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:21,030
Uh... No,
sorry about that. It...

685
00:58:21,032 --> 00:58:23,166
You were on the dive team
with my little sister.

686
00:58:23,168 --> 00:58:25,501
I saw you win state
a couple years ago.

687
00:58:26,605 --> 00:58:29,105
- Oh. Uh, yeah.
- Ladies and gentlemen.

688
00:58:29,107 --> 00:58:30,939
This just got
a whole lot more interesting.

689
00:58:30,941 --> 00:58:34,378
We have a championship
high-diver on our hands!

690
00:58:37,316 --> 00:58:39,650
Yeah, I actually,
I don't, I don't...

691
00:58:39,652 --> 00:58:40,783
I don't do it anymore.

692
00:58:40,785 --> 00:58:43,255
Oh, don't worry.
I won't make you go first.

693
00:58:48,694 --> 00:58:49,759
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
Watch it!

694
00:58:49,761 --> 00:58:51,127
Yeah, Tripp!

695
00:58:53,565 --> 00:58:55,066
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

696
00:58:57,737 --> 00:59:00,803
Dive Girl!
You better not back out on me.

697
00:59:06,646 --> 00:59:09,145
You guys, she's gonna do it!
She's gonna do it!

698
00:59:09,147 --> 00:59:13,451
Dive! Dive! Dive! Dive!

699
00:59:14,486 --> 00:59:15,719
Come on!

700
00:59:15,721 --> 00:59:19,790
Dive! Dive! Dive! Dive!

701
00:59:20,759 --> 00:59:23,162
<i>You got this, Charlie girl!</i>

702
00:59:33,171 --> 00:59:35,204
- Where you going?
- What, are you scared?

703
00:59:35,206 --> 00:59:36,774
- You okay?
- Let's just go.

704
00:59:36,776 --> 00:59:38,207
What a loser!

705
00:59:38,209 --> 00:59:39,909
Thought you said
you were on the diving team.

706
00:59:39,911 --> 00:59:42,414
I think she's
gonna cry in her car.

707
00:59:44,649 --> 00:59:46,385
Where you going,
sweetie?

708
00:59:54,593 --> 00:59:56,226
What happened out there?

709
00:59:56,228 --> 00:59:58,696
That was your big moment to look cool.

710
00:59:58,698 --> 01:00:00,096
What's your damage, Tina?

711
01:00:00,098 --> 01:00:01,665
Is that the churro guy?

712
01:00:01,667 --> 01:00:03,199
Where's your hairnet, dude?

713
01:00:03,201 --> 01:00:06,202
It's in the garbage, Einstein. You
throw them away after each use.

714
01:00:06,204 --> 01:00:09,606
For sanitary purposes,
obviously, but...

715
01:00:09,608 --> 01:00:13,310
This car
is an embarrassment.

716
01:00:13,312 --> 01:00:16,048
You should have your dad
buy you a better one.

717
01:00:19,685 --> 01:00:21,086
Oh, wait...

718
01:00:22,355 --> 01:00:23,356
Sorry.

719
01:00:40,573 --> 01:00:42,272
You okay?

720
01:00:42,274 --> 01:00:43,841
I'm fine.

721
01:00:43,843 --> 01:00:45,244
They're idiots.

722
01:00:46,512 --> 01:00:49,080
But I think I know something
that'll make you feel better.

723
01:00:49,749 --> 01:00:51,315
What?

724
01:00:51,317 --> 01:00:53,284
Revenge.

725
01:00:54,653 --> 01:00:55,885
I don't want revenge.

726
01:00:55,887 --> 01:00:57,253
I do.

727
01:00:57,255 --> 01:00:59,724
What about you, Bee?
Want some revenge?

728
01:01:07,133 --> 01:01:09,235
Come on. I got an idea.

729
01:01:11,035 --> 01:01:12,902
This is Tina's house.

730
01:01:14,306 --> 01:01:16,807
And this,
it's toilet paper.

731
01:01:16,809 --> 01:01:18,544
You use it for when you...

732
01:01:19,779 --> 01:01:21,212
Here, just take a roll.

733
01:01:25,384 --> 01:01:29,052
No, no, no, no. You've got...

734
01:01:29,054 --> 01:01:30,923
You got to throw it.

735
01:01:32,525 --> 01:01:33,659
Like this.

736
01:01:37,496 --> 01:01:38,597
Not bad.

737
01:01:50,877 --> 01:01:52,976
Not... Yeah, um...

738
01:01:52,978 --> 01:01:55,780
Okay, look, Bee,
you be our egg man.

739
01:01:55,782 --> 01:01:58,415
- Right? Yeah. So...
- Love that.

740
01:01:58,417 --> 01:02:00,553
- You see these right here?
- Mmm-hmm.

741
01:02:02,954 --> 01:02:06,122
You grab one
of these, like so.

742
01:02:06,124 --> 01:02:09,259
- And that right there, that's your target.
- That's right.

743
01:02:09,261 --> 01:02:11,565
All right? Just throw
it like this.

744
01:02:13,032 --> 01:02:14,899
I think we could
just hand it to him...

745
01:02:14,901 --> 01:02:16,235
He could maybe,
yeah, and then...

746
01:02:17,069 --> 01:02:18,604
Uh...

747
01:02:21,707 --> 01:02:23,742
- Bee, what are...
- What, um...

748
01:02:32,016 --> 01:02:33,685
Don't hurt me.

749
01:02:33,687 --> 01:02:35,522
Oh, my God...

750
01:02:41,628 --> 01:02:42,694
Oh, shit!

751
01:02:46,933 --> 01:02:49,168
- Hide, hide, hide.
- Hide!

752
01:02:51,770 --> 01:02:52,937
- Stay...
- Oh, okay!

753
01:02:52,939 --> 01:02:54,404
Okay. Okay.

754
01:02:54,406 --> 01:02:55,674
Hide, Bee!

755
01:03:07,554 --> 01:03:09,154
Go, go, go!

756
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:24,771
Mom!

757
01:03:39,685 --> 01:03:42,152
That was insane!

758
01:03:42,154 --> 01:03:44,022
My heart right now

759
01:03:44,024 --> 01:03:45,088
is going crazy.

760
01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:46,593
Uh-oh!

761
01:03:47,394 --> 01:03:49,093
- Oh, God.
- Stop the car, please.

762
01:03:50,297 --> 01:03:52,497
Bee, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

763
01:04:02,576 --> 01:04:03,641
Bumblebee!

764
01:04:22,127 --> 01:04:23,595
Oh, my God!

765
01:04:34,075 --> 01:04:36,276
Oh, my God, we're
committing a felony!

766
01:04:42,816 --> 01:04:44,649
We got a yellow vehicle

767
01:04:44,651 --> 01:04:47,387
driving its damn self
through the Pico Tunnel.

768
01:04:57,698 --> 01:04:59,199
Uh...

769
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:31,731
Good night.

770
01:05:35,969 --> 01:05:37,203
Good night.

771
01:05:46,881 --> 01:05:48,348
Good night, Bee.

772
01:06:01,494 --> 01:06:04,929
Morning, buddy.
I got to go to work, okay?

773
01:06:04,931 --> 01:06:08,833
Bee. Listen to me. You need
to stay in this garage, okay?

774
01:06:08,835 --> 01:06:10,069
After what
happened last night,

775
01:06:10,071 --> 01:06:12,071
I'm pretty sure the cops
are looking for you,

776
01:06:12,073 --> 01:06:14,775
and, uh, you don't
exactly blend in.

777
01:06:15,843 --> 01:06:17,642
I'll be back, all right?

778
01:06:21,148 --> 01:06:22,415
Here.

779
01:06:24,417 --> 01:06:25,919
You can have my Pop-Tart.

780
01:06:37,031 --> 01:06:41,602
I need you to go to the frozen
banana stand and steal some sticks.

781
01:06:42,737 --> 01:06:43,836
We're out of sticks.

782
01:06:43,838 --> 01:06:46,539
Can't we just sell the
hot dogs without the sticks?

783
01:06:47,041 --> 01:06:48,107
No.

784
01:09:27,235 --> 01:09:30,203
- What's happening here?
- We got a hit, I think. Where's that location?

785
01:09:30,205 --> 01:09:33,807
Near San Francisco. A coastal
town named Brighton Falls.

786
01:09:52,459 --> 01:09:54,695
You have a personal call.

787
01:09:58,999 --> 01:10:01,600
- Hello?
- <i>Charlie, hey, it's Memo.</i>

788
01:10:01,602 --> 01:10:03,871
You got to come home
right now.

789
01:10:10,879 --> 01:10:13,547
It's bad.
It's really, really bad.

790
01:10:18,887 --> 01:10:20,155
Where's Bumblebee?

791
01:10:25,926 --> 01:10:29,429
Bumblebee,
what have you done?

792
01:10:29,431 --> 01:10:31,930
What were you thinking?
What...

793
01:10:31,932 --> 01:10:34,602
I told you to hide
in the garage!

794
01:10:36,404 --> 01:10:38,037
Great.

795
01:10:38,039 --> 01:10:39,973
Helpful shame spiral, Bee.

796
01:10:41,675 --> 01:10:45,378
I'm not mad, okay?
This is all my fault.

797
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:47,182
I never should
have left you.

798
01:10:51,652 --> 01:10:53,785
Hey, okay, maybe
don't transform all the way?

799
01:10:53,787 --> 01:10:56,188
We've still got to get
you through the door.

800
01:10:57,426 --> 01:10:58,827
Come on, buddy.

801
01:10:59,894 --> 01:11:01,096
It's okay.

802
01:11:20,248 --> 01:11:21,783
I am so screwed.

803
01:11:34,996 --> 01:11:37,763
And now you're
crippled for life.

804
01:11:37,765 --> 01:11:39,833
Honey, watch the hair.

805
01:11:45,508 --> 01:11:48,308
Go. Now. But be quiet.

806
01:11:48,310 --> 01:11:49,809
Mom, wait!

807
01:11:52,047 --> 01:11:53,281
Oh, my God!

808
01:11:56,017 --> 01:11:57,884
- Mom...
- What happened?

809
01:11:57,886 --> 01:12:00,119
I'm sorry.
This is all my fault.

810
01:12:00,121 --> 01:12:01,487
What'd you do to my TV?

811
01:12:01,489 --> 01:12:05,158
Look, Mom, I can explain. We will
talk about this later, all right?

812
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:07,460
- Now, I have to go.
- Are you kidding me?

813
01:12:07,462 --> 01:12:08,861
No. You're not
going anywhere.

814
01:12:08,863 --> 01:12:11,664
- It's about my car. It's really important.
- About your car?

815
01:12:11,666 --> 01:12:15,968
That you spend all day and night shut in
that garage, doing God-knows-what with?

816
01:12:15,970 --> 01:12:18,071
Mom, I can't.
I really can't right now.

817
01:12:18,073 --> 01:12:20,507
Oh, no, you really can,
Charlie.

818
01:12:20,509 --> 01:12:22,543
You really can.

819
01:12:22,545 --> 01:12:23,709
I have had it!

820
01:12:23,711 --> 01:12:26,279
Your attitude,
your always sulking around.

821
01:12:26,281 --> 01:12:29,916
You brought home that piece of
crap without even asking me!

822
01:12:29,918 --> 01:12:32,953
Everyone in this family
is trying to be happy,

823
01:12:32,955 --> 01:12:35,556
and all you want to do
is make things harder.

824
01:12:35,558 --> 01:12:37,357
You know, Mom,
just because you've moved on

825
01:12:37,359 --> 01:12:40,927
and you're happy with your
new life doesn't mean I have!

826
01:12:40,929 --> 01:12:43,696
You've found a replacement
for my dad and I haven't,

827
01:12:43,698 --> 01:12:44,831
okay, and I never will!

828
01:12:44,833 --> 01:12:47,200
So I'm sorry if that
makes things harder,

829
01:12:47,202 --> 01:12:48,968
but in ten months from now

830
01:12:48,970 --> 01:12:50,872
you won't even have
to deal with me!

831
01:12:52,606 --> 01:12:54,008
Charlie!

832
01:13:04,018 --> 01:13:05,354
Hey, you okay?

833
01:13:07,122 --> 01:13:08,223
Yeah.

834
01:13:10,925 --> 01:13:12,959
I just feel like
ever since my dad died,

835
01:13:12,961 --> 01:13:16,131
I've become this drain
on everyone, and I hate it.

836
01:13:17,599 --> 01:13:18,998
It's like everybody expects me

837
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,101
to act like
nothing ever happened,

838
01:13:21,103 --> 01:13:23,738
and it's impossible
to do that.

839
01:13:25,874 --> 01:13:29,078
About your dad,
I'm really sorry.

840
01:13:29,545 --> 01:13:31,545
Thanks.

841
01:13:31,547 --> 01:13:34,316
You know, there's
this quote that I like.

842
01:13:35,950 --> 01:13:39,387
"The darkest nights
produce the brightest stars."

843
01:13:43,691 --> 01:13:45,161
That's nice.

844
01:13:46,061 --> 01:13:47,997
My mom got it
from Weight Watchers.

845
01:14:02,777 --> 01:14:05,479
Get out and move
away from the vehicle.

846
01:14:06,649 --> 01:14:08,481
Stay cool, Bee.

847
01:14:17,593 --> 01:14:18,659
What's going on?

848
01:14:20,162 --> 01:14:21,061
Hey!

849
01:14:21,063 --> 01:14:22,830
- Come on!
- Stop it!

850
01:14:23,499 --> 01:14:25,131
Let go of me!

851
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,402
- Weapons now! Take it down!
- Run!

852
01:14:28,404 --> 01:14:30,269
No, don't run.
Do not run!

853
01:14:34,143 --> 01:14:35,209
She ran.

854
01:14:58,734 --> 01:15:00,336
Please tell me
they're on our side.

855
01:15:13,349 --> 01:15:15,349
No more running.

856
01:15:15,351 --> 01:15:17,451
No more hiding.

857
01:15:20,990 --> 01:15:25,727
B-127, you're a traitor
and a coward.

858
01:15:25,729 --> 01:15:28,130
Tell us where
Optimus Prime is hiding.

859
01:15:31,166 --> 01:15:33,202
Bee, look out!

860
01:15:34,937 --> 01:15:36,937
Why isn't he fighting back?

861
01:15:36,939 --> 01:15:38,804
Why don't you fight?

862
01:15:38,806 --> 01:15:40,409
Leave him alone!
Please!

863
01:15:44,413 --> 01:15:45,846
Again.

864
01:15:49,218 --> 01:15:50,219
Hit it again!

865
01:15:51,721 --> 01:15:53,320
Stop! Stop it!

866
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:26,720
Your daughter stole
government property, Mrs. Watson.

867
01:16:26,722 --> 01:16:29,022
She's been
having trouble adjusting,

868
01:16:29,024 --> 01:16:31,725
but we had no idea
it was this serious.

869
01:16:31,727 --> 01:16:32,959
I...

870
01:16:32,961 --> 01:16:34,362
Charlie. Honey.

871
01:16:34,364 --> 01:16:37,532
I didn't steal anything,
and he doesn't belong to them.

872
01:16:37,534 --> 01:16:38,932
- "He?"
- Ma'am.

873
01:16:38,934 --> 01:16:41,335
I can assure you
that it is an "it".

874
01:16:41,337 --> 01:16:43,471
And "it" is a highly dangerous
war machine.

875
01:16:43,473 --> 01:16:46,808
No, he isn't, okay, Mom?
He's not some "war machine."

876
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:50,243
I don't know
what he is, but...

877
01:16:50,245 --> 01:16:51,945
He's my friend.

878
01:16:51,947 --> 01:16:54,815
Ma'am, your daughter's had
a traumatic experience today.

879
01:16:54,817 --> 01:16:57,018
Maybe doesn't understand
everything she's seen.

880
01:16:57,020 --> 01:16:58,319
She's disoriented.

881
01:16:58,321 --> 01:17:00,987
No, I'm fine, Mom.
I'm completely fine, okay?

882
01:17:00,989 --> 01:17:03,857
You have to believe me, please.
I didn't steal anything!

883
01:17:03,859 --> 01:17:06,195
Stop! Just go
to your room.

884
01:17:13,202 --> 01:17:15,270
When I was going
through puberty,

885
01:17:16,505 --> 01:17:18,572
I stole things, too.

886
01:17:18,574 --> 01:17:21,444
- Stole a box of Mallomars once.
- Yeah, we know.

887
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:06,221
Boom.

888
01:18:07,289 --> 01:18:08,891
Caught you.

889
01:18:08,893 --> 01:18:10,826
Oh, Mom's gonna love this.

890
01:18:10,828 --> 01:18:12,593
Look, Otis, you need
to go home and...

891
01:18:12,595 --> 01:18:14,095
Mom!

892
01:18:14,097 --> 01:18:16,997
No, Otis, stop it! Why would you do that?

893
01:18:16,999 --> 01:18:19,734
Let go of me! You're touching my buttocks!

894
01:18:19,736 --> 01:18:22,572
I will tell you a secret
if you shut up.

895
01:18:23,773 --> 01:18:27,642
Okay, so, um,
this is my room.

896
01:18:27,644 --> 01:18:29,309
Just make yourself at home.

897
01:18:29,311 --> 01:18:31,411
These are actually
my sister's stuff.

898
01:18:31,413 --> 01:18:34,382
She likes playing pranks, like
putting her stuff over here.

899
01:18:34,384 --> 01:18:36,584
- Can I, uh, sit down?
- Yeah, yeah. Mmm-hmm.

900
01:18:36,586 --> 01:18:38,252
<i>Residents of
Brighton Falls have been witness</i>

901
01:18:38,254 --> 01:18:40,655
<i>to an unusual sight
this evening.</i>

902
01:18:40,657 --> 01:18:44,158
<i>Armed Forces pouring into town
as part of what we are told</i>

903
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:47,060
<i>is a routine military exercise</i>

904
01:18:47,062 --> 01:18:49,797
<i>setting up camp
at our own McKinnon Air Base.</i>

905
01:18:49,799 --> 01:18:53,066
If Bumblebee's still alive,
that's where they're keeping him.

906
01:18:53,068 --> 01:18:55,168
We have to go.
We have to try and save him.

907
01:18:55,170 --> 01:18:57,073
Count me in. I'll take point.

908
01:18:58,074 --> 01:18:59,741
- No, you won't.
- Come on.

909
01:18:59,743 --> 01:19:01,175
No, Otis.

910
01:19:01,177 --> 01:19:03,578
- But I can help. Master Larry says I...
- I need someone here.

911
01:19:03,580 --> 01:19:07,782
I need someone reliable to make sure that
Mom and Ron don't know that I'm gone.

912
01:19:07,784 --> 01:19:09,285
I'm someone reliable.

913
01:19:11,019 --> 01:19:12,388
Hell, yeah, you are.

914
01:19:17,327 --> 01:19:18,528
Good luck.

915
01:19:19,061 --> 01:19:20,662
You, too.

916
01:19:20,664 --> 01:19:22,131
Get over here.

917
01:19:26,971 --> 01:19:28,336
Oh.

918
01:19:28,338 --> 01:19:29,506
Let's do this.

919
01:19:32,075 --> 01:19:33,140
Tell us where

920
01:19:33,142 --> 01:19:35,142
Optimus Prime
and the rebels are hiding,

921
01:19:35,144 --> 01:19:38,114
and we can end this war.

922
01:19:40,350 --> 01:19:41,215
Talk!

923
01:19:41,217 --> 01:19:43,451
Who is Optimus Prime?

924
01:19:43,453 --> 01:19:46,055
This doesn't
concern you, human Powell.

925
01:19:46,423 --> 01:19:48,526
Last chance.

926
01:19:54,899 --> 01:19:57,498
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

927
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:59,600
It's a terrible idea,
but I've got to try it.

928
01:19:59,602 --> 01:20:02,303
You can't get... Well, why
don't you... Stop, stop, wait...

929
01:20:02,305 --> 01:20:05,408
- How'd you know the power was off?
- I didn't. Let's go.

930
01:20:10,981 --> 01:20:12,246
Can I?

931
01:20:12,248 --> 01:20:14,518
His memory cells are fried.

932
01:20:15,385 --> 01:20:16,652
Finish him.

933
01:20:22,893 --> 01:20:28,095
<i>We will fight on. Regroup,
rebuild, and retake our home.</i>

934
01:20:28,097 --> 01:20:30,698
<i>But we must find refuge first.</i>

935
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:32,301
<i>You will travel to Earth.</i>

936
01:20:32,303 --> 01:20:35,003
<i>Once we've gathered
the others, we'll join you.</i>

937
01:20:35,005 --> 01:20:37,204
<i>You must protect the planet.</i>

938
01:20:37,206 --> 01:20:42,778
<i>If the Decepticons find it, then
our people are truly finished.</i>

939
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:45,047
<i>Stay safe, soldier.</i>

940
01:20:45,049 --> 01:20:47,450
<i>I am coming.</i>

941
01:20:49,118 --> 01:20:51,752
Prime is coming here?

942
01:20:51,754 --> 01:20:53,955
They're all coming here.

943
01:20:53,957 --> 01:20:58,193
This is our chance to wipe out
the Autobot resistance for good.

944
01:20:58,195 --> 01:21:01,830
We'll burn the whole
planet to cinders.

945
01:21:01,832 --> 01:21:04,231
We must get word
to Cybertron immediately.

946
01:21:04,233 --> 01:21:05,366
<i>This is Burns.</i>

947
01:21:05,368 --> 01:21:08,070
Tell them to bring an army.

948
01:21:08,072 --> 01:21:10,471
Burns, we made
a terrible mistake.

949
01:21:10,473 --> 01:21:11,572
Powell?

950
01:21:11,574 --> 01:21:14,408
And thanks to
our human allies,

951
01:21:14,410 --> 01:21:16,912
I know just how to get
the message home.

952
01:21:16,914 --> 01:21:19,213
They're using our satellites.

953
01:21:19,215 --> 01:21:20,782
<i>They're calling an army.</i>

954
01:21:20,784 --> 01:21:23,051
They're gonna kill us all.

955
01:21:23,053 --> 01:21:28,023
Thank you for your
hospitality, friend Powell.

956
01:21:28,025 --> 01:21:29,593
He's all yours.

957
01:21:30,928 --> 01:21:32,159
- No.
<i>- Powell?</i>

958
01:21:32,161 --> 01:21:33,695
<i>- You have to stop them!</i>
- Powell!

959
01:21:38,234 --> 01:21:39,600
Where's the Krazy Glue?

960
01:21:39,602 --> 01:21:42,238
What, did she cut
the wire to the TV?

961
01:21:42,672 --> 01:21:44,206
Ron.

962
01:21:44,208 --> 01:21:46,608
Charlie!

963
01:21:46,610 --> 01:21:47,676
Charlie!

964
01:21:47,678 --> 01:21:51,181
Nice! Reel-to-reel still works.

965
01:21:52,016 --> 01:21:54,616
Where is
your sister?

966
01:21:54,618 --> 01:21:57,953
Charlie's fallen ill and must stay in
her bedroom for the rest of the evening.

967
01:21:57,955 --> 01:22:01,790
She wishes not to be troubled.
Keep clear of her chambers.

968
01:22:01,792 --> 01:22:02,826
What?

969
01:22:07,097 --> 01:22:08,530
Charlie has fallen ill

970
01:22:08,532 --> 01:22:11,400
and must stay in her bedroom
for the rest of the evening.

971
01:22:11,402 --> 01:22:13,935
- She wishes not to...
- Otis!

972
01:22:13,937 --> 01:22:16,105
Are you on drugs? Hmm?

973
01:22:16,107 --> 01:22:17,539
No, no. Mom, Mom, Mom.

974
01:22:17,541 --> 01:22:19,341
- Please stop. Stop!
- Charlie!

975
01:22:19,343 --> 01:22:21,443
- Mom, there is no reason to go...
- Where is she?

976
01:22:21,445 --> 01:22:23,547
- Mom, stop!
- Quit it, Otis.

977
01:22:29,552 --> 01:22:30,754
Where is she?

978
01:22:31,922 --> 01:22:33,290
Uh...

979
01:22:34,458 --> 01:22:35,759
Otis?

980
01:22:38,262 --> 01:22:40,929
I found a tower
to transmit our message.

981
01:22:40,931 --> 01:22:42,964
It's close.

982
01:22:42,966 --> 01:22:47,669
Oh. B-127.
I almost forgot.

983
01:22:47,671 --> 01:22:48,970
I didn't.

984
01:22:51,175 --> 01:22:52,710
No! Don't shoot!

985
01:22:54,712 --> 01:22:56,011
No!

986
01:23:11,562 --> 01:23:12,696
Bee!

987
01:23:15,132 --> 01:23:16,667
Talk to me, Bee, talk to me.

988
01:23:23,074 --> 01:23:25,942
I can fix this.
I can fix this.

989
01:23:30,048 --> 01:23:31,180
Charlie.

990
01:23:31,182 --> 01:23:34,649
You got to wake up, Bee.
You got to wake up.

991
01:23:34,651 --> 01:23:35,652
Please.

992
01:23:37,488 --> 01:23:39,356
Charlie, we got to go.

993
01:23:43,894 --> 01:23:45,161
- The gun.
- What?

994
01:23:45,163 --> 01:23:46,731
The electric gun. Get it.

995
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:50,501
I can fix you.

996
01:23:53,004 --> 01:23:54,336
Come on, Bee.

997
01:23:54,338 --> 01:23:55,839
Come back to me.

998
01:24:02,012 --> 01:24:03,814
Come on, give me
the other one.

999
01:24:10,121 --> 01:24:11,790
Bee, come on.

1000
01:24:13,925 --> 01:24:15,693
I can't lose you, too, Bee.

1001
01:24:16,127 --> 01:24:17,528
Please, Bee!

1002
01:24:31,742 --> 01:24:32,744
I'm sorry.

1003
01:24:46,891 --> 01:24:48,026
Oh.

1004
01:24:57,735 --> 01:24:59,569
Oh, my God.

1005
01:24:59,571 --> 01:25:01,773
Come on, Bee, we've got
to get you out of here.

1006
01:25:13,985 --> 01:25:17,220
Charlie, there's like
a million guys out there!

1007
01:25:17,222 --> 01:25:19,521
We got to move, now.

1008
01:25:19,523 --> 01:25:21,659
Come on, Bee, you've gotta get up.
Can you get up?

1009
01:25:22,527 --> 01:25:24,529
There's a door in my way.

1010
01:25:26,965 --> 01:25:27,997
They've got bombs!

1011
01:25:27,999 --> 01:25:29,767
- We got to go.
- Bee, come on.

1012
01:25:31,736 --> 01:25:32,668
Charlie!

1013
01:25:32,670 --> 01:25:34,038
You've gotta get up, come on.

1014
01:25:34,939 --> 01:25:36,538
- Three.
- Charlie!

1015
01:25:36,540 --> 01:25:38,274
- Two.
- Come on.

1016
01:25:38,276 --> 01:25:39,374
One.

1017
01:25:39,376 --> 01:25:40,711
- Charlie!
- Come on.

1018
01:25:57,762 --> 01:25:58,963
Memo?

1019
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:05,301
Memo. Memo, wake up.

1020
01:26:06,905 --> 01:26:08,173
Easy.

1021
01:26:11,277 --> 01:26:12,477
Easy.

1022
01:26:15,046 --> 01:26:16,380
Hold your fire!

1023
01:26:16,382 --> 01:26:18,116
Get the kid out of here.

1024
01:26:19,417 --> 01:26:22,618
Memo! Wake up, Memo!

1025
01:26:22,620 --> 01:26:23,886
Come on, kid.

1026
01:26:23,888 --> 01:26:25,056
Hey! No!

1027
01:26:25,890 --> 01:26:26,958
Bee!

1028
01:26:27,191 --> 01:26:28,291
Run!

1029
01:26:30,427 --> 01:26:31,628
Bee!

1030
01:26:32,865 --> 01:26:34,064
Run!

1031
01:26:34,066 --> 01:26:36,226
- Let go of me!
- You need to get away from that thing.

1032
01:26:39,003 --> 01:26:41,139
- Take it down!
- No, stop!

1033
01:26:42,674 --> 01:26:45,474
- Stop it!
- Contain it and dismantle it!

1034
01:26:45,476 --> 01:26:47,777
Strip it down to parts!

1035
01:26:47,779 --> 01:26:50,513
Leave him alone!
You don't understand.

1036
01:26:51,983 --> 01:26:53,481
Fight back, Bee!

1037
01:26:53,483 --> 01:26:55,919
- Bee!
- Kid, stop! It's a machine!

1038
01:26:55,921 --> 01:26:58,454
He's more human
than you'll ever be!

1039
01:26:58,456 --> 01:27:00,556
That is enough!

1040
01:27:23,514 --> 01:27:24,815
Oh, shit.

1041
01:27:36,027 --> 01:27:37,061
Open fire!

1042
01:27:50,209 --> 01:27:52,177
Fall back! Take cover!

1043
01:28:07,825 --> 01:28:08,827
Bee!

1044
01:28:11,363 --> 01:28:12,698
Bee!

1045
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,567
Bee, stop!

1046
01:28:36,121 --> 01:28:38,955
You remember, don't you?

1047
01:28:43,395 --> 01:28:44,997
They're coming back.

1048
01:28:50,302 --> 01:28:51,669
Oh, God.

1049
01:28:52,171 --> 01:28:53,638
Are you okay?

1050
01:28:54,273 --> 01:28:56,840
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

1051
01:28:56,842 --> 01:28:58,811
We need to get out of here.

1052
01:28:59,912 --> 01:29:01,914
We've got to get you
someplace safe.

1053
01:29:05,284 --> 01:29:07,784
Bee, stop. They will kill you!

1054
01:29:07,786 --> 01:29:10,153
<i>If the Decepticons find Earth,</i>

1055
01:29:10,155 --> 01:29:13,292
<i>then our people
are truly finished.</i>

1056
01:29:14,792 --> 01:29:17,662
Okay.
Then we fight.

1057
01:29:25,572 --> 01:29:27,538
Let's go, get in.

1058
01:29:29,608 --> 01:29:31,777
Go on. I'll buy you
some time with these guys.

1059
01:29:42,687 --> 01:29:44,157
You just kiss me?

1060
01:29:45,358 --> 01:29:46,656
On the cheek.

1061
01:29:46,658 --> 01:29:48,127
Still counts.

1062
01:29:54,534 --> 01:29:55,734
Still counts.

1063
01:30:05,477 --> 01:30:06,677
Halt!

1064
01:30:08,081 --> 01:30:09,413
Stop.

1065
01:30:14,254 --> 01:30:15,721
Well, that didn't work.

1066
01:30:22,562 --> 01:30:23,829
Move, move!

1067
01:30:39,811 --> 01:30:41,747
Faster, Bee, faster!

1068
01:30:44,384 --> 01:30:46,249
We should really look
into getting seatbelts.

1069
01:30:46,251 --> 01:30:47,684
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

1070
01:30:47,686 --> 01:30:49,953
It's okay. She's gonna steal the
robot back, fight off the police,

1071
01:30:49,955 --> 01:30:52,055
kill two bigger robots,
and come right back home.

1072
01:30:52,057 --> 01:30:53,123
Shut up, Otis.

1073
01:30:53,125 --> 01:30:54,457
<i>Folks, this just breaking.</i>

1074
01:30:54,459 --> 01:30:57,562
<i>There appears to be
a high-speed chase underway</i>

1075
01:30:57,564 --> 01:30:59,430
<i>just outside
McKinnon Air Base.</i>

1076
01:30:59,432 --> 01:31:00,665
Go right! Go right!

1077
01:31:13,345 --> 01:31:15,512
Closer. Closer.

1078
01:31:15,514 --> 01:31:16,647
You lose that car,

1079
01:31:16,649 --> 01:31:18,817
I will
personally rip your face off.

1080
01:31:22,455 --> 01:31:23,521
Oh, God!

1081
01:31:23,523 --> 01:31:24,723
It's all under control.

1082
01:31:28,927 --> 01:31:30,595
- Charlie!
- Mom?

1083
01:31:30,597 --> 01:31:32,796
You pull that car over
right this second.

1084
01:31:32,798 --> 01:31:34,965
This is very unsafe,
what you're doing.

1085
01:31:34,967 --> 01:31:36,800
Mom, you got to get
out of here, okay?

1086
01:31:36,802 --> 01:31:38,937
Whoa! Whoa!

1087
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:42,105
Mom...

1088
01:31:42,107 --> 01:31:44,310
You have to trust me, please!

1089
01:31:45,678 --> 01:31:46,877
Charlie!

1090
01:31:46,879 --> 01:31:49,182
- We got to help her, Ron!
- Hang on.

1091
01:31:51,883 --> 01:31:53,819
Oh, my God! Ron!

1092
01:31:56,955 --> 01:31:58,822
Get out of the way!

1093
01:31:58,824 --> 01:32:00,824
Oh, my gosh!
What are you doing?

1094
01:32:00,826 --> 01:32:02,395
I saw this on <i>Miami Vice.</i>

1095
01:32:06,098 --> 01:32:08,165
God!

1096
01:32:08,167 --> 01:32:10,768
- Oh. Oh. I got it, I got it, I got it.
- Oh, my God!

1097
01:32:10,770 --> 01:32:12,839
Whoa!

1098
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:22,213
Whoa!

1099
01:32:25,618 --> 01:32:26,818
Whoa!

1100
01:32:34,861 --> 01:32:36,262
Nice driving, Ron.

1101
01:32:38,231 --> 01:32:41,032
Is everyone okay?

1102
01:32:41,034 --> 01:32:44,035
Ron! We have
a kid in the car!

1103
01:32:44,037 --> 01:32:46,903
I was trying to save
the other kid! What was I...

1104
01:32:46,905 --> 01:32:48,639
It was a lose-lose.

1105
01:32:48,641 --> 01:32:51,311
Otis? Otis,
are you all right?

1106
01:32:52,712 --> 01:32:56,015
That was radical.

1107
01:33:23,076 --> 01:33:25,878
Preparing satellites
to transmit our message.

1108
01:33:44,897 --> 01:33:46,933
Okay. What's the plan?

1109
01:33:51,270 --> 01:33:56,440
This is the plan? I hate this plan.
Bee, I want to help.

1110
01:34:02,048 --> 01:34:06,252
You're actually talking. And
you're listening to The Smiths.

1111
01:34:16,563 --> 01:34:17,564
Be careful.

1112
01:34:26,539 --> 01:34:29,942
Handle him! And finish
the job this time!

1113
01:34:46,559 --> 01:34:47,560
Oh, shit!

1114
01:35:14,922 --> 01:35:16,788
How the hell am I
gonna get up there?

1115
01:36:51,652 --> 01:36:54,086
There. The one on the tower.

1116
01:37:54,314 --> 01:37:56,818
You think these little chains
can hold...

1117
01:38:09,497 --> 01:38:10,698
Okay.

1118
01:38:35,823 --> 01:38:37,659
Hold on!

1119
01:38:57,011 --> 01:38:58,813
What are you doing?

1120
01:39:37,985 --> 01:39:39,419
Come on.

1121
01:39:44,492 --> 01:39:45,593
Come on.

1122
01:40:05,780 --> 01:40:06,781
No.

1123
01:40:28,603 --> 01:40:32,973
After I kill you,
I kill her.

1124
01:40:32,975 --> 01:40:34,042
Bee, no!

1125
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:39,212
You missed.

1126
01:40:46,020 --> 01:40:47,588
You'll kill us both!

1127
01:40:57,331 --> 01:40:58,767
Bumblebee!

1128
01:42:19,714 --> 01:42:21,049
Oh, God.

1129
01:42:22,884 --> 01:42:24,385
You.

1130
01:42:30,391 --> 01:42:31,927
You need to get outta here.

1131
01:42:33,528 --> 01:42:35,061
What do you mean?

1132
01:42:35,063 --> 01:42:37,429
I mean my friends are coming.

1133
01:42:37,431 --> 01:42:39,067
And they're gonna
be looking for him.

1134
01:42:42,871 --> 01:42:44,139
Thank you.

1135
01:42:46,440 --> 01:42:48,010
Thank you.

1136
01:43:03,091 --> 01:43:04,491
Hey, soldier!

1137
01:43:35,190 --> 01:43:37,558
I'm here. I made it.

1138
01:43:38,459 --> 01:43:40,427
What's going on?

1139
01:43:40,429 --> 01:43:42,197
World's already
been saved, kid.

1140
01:43:43,299 --> 01:43:44,733
Cool.

1141
01:43:46,034 --> 01:43:47,636
Cool.

1142
01:43:50,273 --> 01:43:52,808
Hey, can you call my mom?

1143
01:44:01,016 --> 01:44:02,516
This is it, Bee.

1144
01:44:27,541 --> 01:44:29,144
Bee, I can't go with you.

1145
01:44:39,688 --> 01:44:41,957
You've got people out there
that need you.

1146
01:44:45,227 --> 01:44:46,828
And so do I.

1147
01:44:55,772 --> 01:44:57,507
I gotta let you go.

1148
01:45:04,846 --> 01:45:06,180
<i>Thank you...</i>

1149
01:45:06,182 --> 01:45:07,515
<i>So much...</i>

1150
01:45:07,517 --> 01:45:08,681
<i>For giving me...</i>

1151
01:45:08,683 --> 01:45:10,052
<i>My voice.</i>

1152
01:45:14,356 --> 01:45:16,324
Thank you for...

1153
01:45:17,826 --> 01:45:19,962
For making me feel
like me again.

1154
01:45:25,468 --> 01:45:26,936
I'll never forget you.

1155
01:45:38,548 --> 01:45:40,248
Goodbye, Bumblebee.

1156
01:46:09,345 --> 01:46:11,013
No way.

1157
01:46:11,614 --> 01:46:14,315
You kidding me?

1158
01:46:14,317 --> 01:46:18,352
Are you telling me you could've
been a Camaro this whole time?

1159
01:46:18,354 --> 01:46:21,422
Oh, my God!

1160
01:47:07,702 --> 01:47:09,238
Here you go, ma'am.

1161
01:47:17,346 --> 01:47:18,846
Baby.

1162
01:47:18,848 --> 01:47:20,781
Thank God you're all right.

1163
01:47:20,783 --> 01:47:22,018
Thanks for coming, Mom.

1164
01:47:27,790 --> 01:47:29,624
That was some driving, Ron.

1165
01:47:29,626 --> 01:47:32,061
Well, I've taken a few notes.

1166
01:47:34,497 --> 01:47:35,697
Otis.

1167
01:47:37,433 --> 01:47:38,767
They forced me to tell.

1168
01:47:41,137 --> 01:47:43,003
I'm glad they did.

1169
01:47:43,005 --> 01:47:44,675
I couldn't have done it
without you guys.

1170
01:47:49,879 --> 01:47:51,314
Hey, Charlie.

1171
01:47:56,852 --> 01:47:58,454
I'll be right back,
okay?

1172
01:48:01,991 --> 01:48:05,392
Wow, um,
what happened to you today?

1173
01:48:05,394 --> 01:48:06,894
Oh, this?

1174
01:48:06,896 --> 01:48:11,235
Oh, you know, robot fights, high-speed
chases, international disasters.

1175
01:48:12,302 --> 01:48:13,702
The usual.

1176
01:48:13,704 --> 01:48:15,269
- Right.
- Yeah.

1177
01:48:26,717 --> 01:48:28,148
Ooh, um...

1178
01:48:28,150 --> 01:48:29,782
Yeah, hmm...

1179
01:48:29,784 --> 01:48:31,019
- Not quite there yet.
- Nope.

1180
01:48:31,021 --> 01:48:32,456
- Yep. Okay, okay.
- No. Yeah.

1181
01:48:51,140 --> 01:48:55,043
Old friend,
you kept this planet safe.

1182
01:48:55,045 --> 01:49:00,148
Because of you,
we have a future, B-127.

1183
01:49:00,150 --> 01:49:01,650
<i>My name...</i>

1184
01:49:01,652 --> 01:49:02,783
<i>Is...</i>

1185
01:49:02,785 --> 01:49:04,152
<i>Bumblebee.</i>

1186
01:49:29,979 --> 01:49:31,780
Let's see
if we got something.

1187
01:49:31,782 --> 01:49:34,318
Oh, my God, yes!
