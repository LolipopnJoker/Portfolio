2
00:00:40,297 --> 00:00:44,494
Year after year, 20-something
women come to New York City...

3
00:00:44,668 --> 00:00:47,500
...in search of the two L's:

4
00:00:47,671 --> 00:00:50,866
Labels and love.

5
00:00:53,742 --> 00:00:55,904
- Yeah.
- It's the best.

6
00:00:57,047 --> 00:00:59,105
Hot dress!

7
00:00:59,516 --> 00:01:02,610
Twenty years ago, I was one of them.

8
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:18,826
Having gotten the knack for labels early,
I concentrated on my search for love.

9
00:01:19,003 --> 00:01:23,165
Turns out, a knockoff is not as
easy to spot when it comes to love.

10
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,240
What? You're married?

11
00:01:25,407 --> 00:01:27,672
You fucking asshole!
Motherfucker, you're married?

12
00:01:27,844 --> 00:01:30,175
- Until it is.
- I fucking hate you.

13
00:01:30,348 --> 00:01:32,780
That is why you need help to spot them.

14
00:01:33,316 --> 00:01:34,942
Lots of help.

15
00:01:35,117 --> 00:01:38,143
Help also known as Charlotte York...

16
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,621
...Miranda Hobbes...

17
00:01:42,425 --> 00:01:44,220
...and Samantha Jones.

18
00:01:44,527 --> 00:01:47,928
- Oh, my God, look at his.
Hey.

19
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,458
Hi, how are you?

20
00:01:53,236 --> 00:01:54,327
Oh, well.

21
00:01:56,274 --> 00:02:00,232
My name is Carrie Bradshaw,
and I'm a writer.

22
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:04,210
Year after year,
my single girlfriends were my salvation.

23
00:02:04,382 --> 00:02:07,009
And as it turns out, my meal ticket.

24
00:02:09,251 --> 00:02:12,242
I've been dating since I was 15.
I'm exhausted. Where is he?

25
00:02:12,421 --> 00:02:14,821
Charlotte was looking
for the perfect love.

26
00:02:14,991 --> 00:02:18,049
- Trey can't get it up.
- Well, almost perfect.

27
00:02:18,227 --> 00:02:19,750
I'm becoming a Jew.

28
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,932
We're not barren,
we're reproductively challenged.

29
00:02:27,103 --> 00:02:29,333
- They're giving us a baby.
- That's our baby.

30
00:02:29,506 --> 00:02:32,906
So Charlotte and Harry journeyed
to China and back...

31
00:02:33,076 --> 00:02:35,270
...for their daughter, Lily.

32
00:02:36,112 --> 00:02:38,636
Miranda was a disciple of tough love.

33
00:02:38,815 --> 00:02:40,510
Bye. Great sex.

34
00:02:42,352 --> 00:02:43,944
- Steve, I'm pregnant.
- You're what?

35
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,142
Carrie.

36
00:02:45,322 --> 00:02:48,188
I, Miranda Hobbes,
take you, Steve Brady...

37
00:02:48,357 --> 00:02:51,385
And Miranda journeyed to Brooklyn
for Brady and Steve.

38
00:02:51,561 --> 00:02:53,722
Who wants a Popsicle?

39
00:02:53,898 --> 00:02:55,864
Oh, man. Boy.

40
00:02:56,033 --> 00:02:58,968
Samantha's love was sex.

41
00:02:59,136 --> 00:03:00,659
Lots of sex.

42
00:03:00,838 --> 00:03:03,360
I'm dating a guy
with the funkiest-tasting spunk.

43
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,870
Can I cancel my rice pudding?

44
00:03:05,042 --> 00:03:08,636
And then she found a man
that combined sex and love.

45
00:03:08,812 --> 00:03:10,144
I'm gonna help you be a star.

46
00:03:11,915 --> 00:03:13,212
Yes, he is interested...

47
00:03:13,383 --> 00:03:18,615
So Samantha journeyed to Hollywood
with television star Smith Jerrod.

48
00:03:19,256 --> 00:03:23,021
As for me,
I was looking for something big.

49
00:03:24,194 --> 00:03:25,492
Get in.

50
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:31,692
Mr. Big. Turns out when that big
love comes along, it's not always easy.

51
00:03:31,969 --> 00:03:33,128
Just tell me I'm the one.

52
00:03:33,303 --> 00:03:36,431
And despite all the other chapters
of my life...

53
00:03:36,607 --> 00:03:40,099
...no one was ever quite
big enough until...

54
00:03:40,276 --> 00:03:41,573
Carrie, you're the one.

55
00:03:41,745 --> 00:03:44,646
And just like that, I was.

56
00:03:46,284 --> 00:03:49,046
Three books and three years later...

57
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,986
...we still feel like those
four single girls.

58
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:55,716
And even though time
had moved us on...

59
00:03:55,893 --> 00:03:59,453
...I managed to stay exactly
where I was:

60
00:04:01,732 --> 00:04:02,791
In love.

61
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,806
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

62
00:04:18,081 --> 00:04:19,983
I got a good feeling
about this one, kid.

63
00:04:20,152 --> 00:04:22,210
Oh, I hope so.
I've always loved this block.

64
00:04:23,153 --> 00:04:25,178
Hi, 3C?

65
00:04:25,357 --> 00:04:28,223
Finding the perfect apartment
in New York City...

66
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:32,055
...is like finding the perfect partner.
It can take years.

67
00:04:32,228 --> 00:04:35,925
- So how many is this?
- Thirty-three.

68
00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:38,261
Lucky 33.

69
00:04:41,472 --> 00:04:46,409
- The worst. I just left you a message.
- And the kitchen's through here.

70
00:04:47,812 --> 00:04:49,473
That's the window with the best view.

71
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:54,908
Thirty-four? Lucky 34?

72
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,411
Well, if anything else opens up,
let us know.

73
00:04:58,591 --> 00:05:01,421
We're very interested
in this building.

74
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:04,459
I do have another apartment
that's not even on the market yet.

75
00:05:04,628 --> 00:05:05,889
Care to take a look?

76
00:05:06,064 --> 00:05:07,086
- Sure.
- Sure.

77
00:05:07,263 --> 00:05:08,821
All right, then.

78
00:05:09,467 --> 00:05:12,229
It's more than you were looking to pay.

79
00:05:12,402 --> 00:05:14,701
- How much more?
- More.

80
00:05:23,316 --> 00:05:26,011
So this is where they keep the light.

81
00:05:26,183 --> 00:05:28,241
Oh, my God.

82
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:33,289
I have died
and gone to real-estate heaven.

83
00:05:34,391 --> 00:05:36,358
Just a simple home for two.

84
00:05:37,928 --> 00:05:40,897
And across the rooftop terrace...

85
00:05:41,066 --> 00:05:43,328
What, nirvana?

86
00:05:47,406 --> 00:05:50,499
Hello. I live here.

87
00:05:51,109 --> 00:05:52,837
Your wife has quite a sense of humor.

88
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:57,109
- They're not married.
- He's my boyfriend.

89
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,446
This way.

90
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:04,245
Aren't I a little old
to be introduced as your boyfriend?

91
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:08,255
Point taken. From now on,
you'll be my man-friend.

92
00:06:08,426 --> 00:06:12,156
- That sounds like a dog.
- Well, if the shoe fits...

93
00:06:12,328 --> 00:06:14,729
And this is the master bedroom.

94
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,161
Uh.

95
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:20,598
It's hideous. I hate it. Hurts my eyes.

96
00:06:21,773 --> 00:06:25,571
- How is this place even available?
- Nasty divorce.

97
00:06:25,743 --> 00:06:28,872
If you live here,
what is there to fight about?

98
00:06:35,387 --> 00:06:36,683
Hm.

99
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:40,516
- Well, now I understand the divorce.
- I can build you a better closet.

100
00:06:43,495 --> 00:06:44,963
Welcome home, baby.

101
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:49,131
Can...? Can we afford this?

102
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,994
I got it.

103
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,737
Okay, let's sign some contracts.

104
00:06:55,907 --> 00:06:57,169
"I got it. " Just like that.

105
00:06:57,342 --> 00:07:00,309
- Like he was picking up a check for coffee.
- It sounds perfect.

106
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:02,741
Except for the closet,
which Big says he can redo.

107
00:07:02,915 --> 00:07:04,540
And he says the kitchen needs work.

108
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:08,048
Of course, I don't know about that
because I keep sweaters in my stove.

109
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,346
So he bought it
and you'll live there with him.

110
00:07:10,521 --> 00:07:11,818
Yes, together. That's right.

111
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,653
But he'll own it, so
you're keeping your own place, right?

112
00:07:14,827 --> 00:07:17,386
I haven't figured out the details,
but I'm a smart girl.

113
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,961
I'll figure out something
that I'm comfortable with.

114
00:07:20,131 --> 00:07:22,223
I just wanna be sure
that you're being smart.

115
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,832
And I love you for that.

116
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:26,560
But for now,
can't you stop worrying for me...

117
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:29,933
...and just go ahead and feel
what I want you to feel, jealous?

118
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:35,574
Oh, jealous of me living in this
gorgeous penthouse in Manhattan.

119
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,576
- All right, I'm jealous.
- Thanks.

120
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:40,648
You live in real-estate heaven
and I live in Brooklyn.

121
00:07:40,818 --> 00:07:43,718
New York magazine said
Brooklyn is the new Manhattan.

122
00:07:43,887 --> 00:07:45,719
Whoever wrote that
lives in Brooklyn.

123
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:48,291
- Hey, there she is.
Hey, Hollywood.
- Hey.

124
00:07:50,028 --> 00:07:51,927
Oh, lady. Hi.

125
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,065
- How was your flight?
- Fabulous.

126
00:07:54,233 --> 00:07:55,255
- Oh, good.
- Good.

127
00:07:55,432 --> 00:07:57,060
- Let's go in. I'm so excited.
Show us.

128
00:07:58,403 --> 00:08:03,466
It was a rare occasion that brought
all types of New York women together.

129
00:08:03,641 --> 00:08:05,164
Sorry.

130
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:09,470
Blair Elkenn was a waitress
turned model turned actress...

131
00:08:09,648 --> 00:08:12,549
...turned billionaire's girlfriend
who came home one night...

132
00:08:12,717 --> 00:08:16,346
...to find herself unceremoniously
turned out on the street.

133
00:08:16,521 --> 00:08:17,545
Oh, my God.

134
00:08:17,724 --> 00:08:21,055
And now she was getting
the ultimate breakup revenge:

135
00:08:21,226 --> 00:08:23,249
An embarrassing
and very public auction...

136
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:26,557
...of all the jewelry he had given her
when they were happy.

137
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:30,057
There it is. My baby.

138
00:08:30,235 --> 00:08:31,723
Oh, she's a beauty.

139
00:08:31,903 --> 00:08:34,837
When I saw it in the catalog,
I said to Smith:

140
00:08:35,006 --> 00:08:39,465
"This flower ring is the essence of me.
One of a kind, filled with fire. "

141
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:42,580
- And a little too much.
- Exactly.

142
00:08:42,748 --> 00:08:46,274
Let's go spend some of
my hard-earned Hollywood money.

143
00:08:46,451 --> 00:08:49,419
And now Lot 39, the flower ring.

144
00:08:49,586 --> 00:08:50,612
That's it.

145
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:53,519
We'd like to start the bidding
on this at $ 10,000, please.

146
00:08:53,693 --> 00:08:56,523
At ten-thousand doll...
Thank you, madam. At 10,000.

147
00:08:56,695 --> 00:08:59,184
Fifteen thousand. At $ 15,000.

148
00:08:59,364 --> 00:09:02,265
Hey, she's bidding for somebody
on the phone.

149
00:09:03,035 --> 00:09:05,901
That's not fair.
- Bitch.

150
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,094
The gloves are off.

151
00:09:08,273 --> 00:09:10,833
At $30,000. Now it's against you.
Thirty-five thousand.

152
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,443
- I work hard, I deserve this.
- At 40,000 now.

153
00:09:13,713 --> 00:09:17,113
At 40? Forty thousand?
Forty thousand, thank you.

154
00:09:17,283 --> 00:09:20,218
Forty-five thousand. At $45,000.
Now 50,000?

155
00:09:20,386 --> 00:09:22,945
Fifty fucking thousand.

156
00:09:23,722 --> 00:09:28,351
At 50,000. Fifty-five thousand?
At $55,000 against you.

157
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:32,962
Would you like to say 60?
Sixty to our colorful bidder? At 60,000?

158
00:09:33,131 --> 00:09:35,190
I draw the line at 50.

159
00:09:37,503 --> 00:09:40,836
I thought this auction would be more fun,
but it's kind of sad.

160
00:09:41,006 --> 00:09:42,063
Isn't it?

161
00:09:42,241 --> 00:09:45,404
I thought it was just sad for me
because I know her.

162
00:09:45,578 --> 00:09:47,272
But it really is sad, huh?

163
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,839
And it's funny
because they were so happy.

164
00:09:50,015 --> 00:09:52,482
- Yeah, till they weren't.
- I know, right?

165
00:09:53,817 --> 00:09:57,948
We all told her to get married
but she didn't wanna listen.

166
00:09:58,124 --> 00:10:01,388
He'd been married three times before,
so she let it ride...

167
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:05,392
...and then she came home one night
and he had locked her out.

168
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,428
She didn't even have anywhere to live.

169
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,095
Such a shame. After 10 years.

170
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,965
She was a smart girl...

171
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,267
...till she fell in love.

172
00:10:23,515 --> 00:10:25,643
I'm thinking...

173
00:10:26,484 --> 00:10:29,612
...I'm going to sell my apartment...

174
00:10:29,788 --> 00:10:31,848
...and put the money towards
heaven on 5th.

175
00:10:32,023 --> 00:10:34,013
Why? You love your apartment.

176
00:10:34,192 --> 00:10:38,185
I know, but there's plenty of room
in the new place and...

177
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:41,759
And besides, I...

178
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:44,493
I want to make us a life there.

179
00:10:44,803 --> 00:10:47,863
You know, I... I want it to be ours.

180
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:51,203
It is ours. I bought it for us.

181
00:10:51,377 --> 00:10:55,211
And that's so amazing,
but you bought it.

182
00:10:56,014 --> 00:11:01,179
So really it's your place
and if anything were to happen...

183
00:11:01,352 --> 00:11:02,752
What's going to happen?

184
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,723
Come on, I have to be smart here.We're
not married, I'd have no legal rights...

185
00:11:07,894 --> 00:11:12,125
...you know, to...
To this home that I built...

186
00:11:13,232 --> 00:11:15,061
...with you.

187
00:11:17,204 --> 00:11:19,069
Did you wanna get married?

188
00:11:22,241 --> 00:11:25,869
Well, I didn't...
I didn't think that was an option.

189
00:11:26,246 --> 00:11:27,644
What if it was an option?

190
00:11:29,515 --> 00:11:31,539
Why? What, do you wanna get married?

191
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,943
I wouldn't mind being married to you.

192
00:11:35,121 --> 00:11:37,554
Would you mind being married to me?

193
00:11:38,157 --> 00:11:42,183
No. No, not if...
Not if that's what you wanted.

194
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,887
I mean, is...? Is that what you want?

195
00:11:48,934 --> 00:11:50,925
I want you.

196
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,332
So...

197
00:11:54,073 --> 00:11:55,768
...okay.

198
00:11:55,941 --> 00:11:57,431
So...?

199
00:11:57,676 --> 00:12:00,873
-Really? We're..? We're getting married?
-We're getting married.

200
00:12:01,047 --> 00:12:04,504
- Should we get you a diamond?
- No, no.

201
00:12:05,118 --> 00:12:07,712
Just get me a really big closet.

202
00:12:08,888 --> 00:12:14,019
So the other night Big and I
were talking about...

203
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:19,187
...you know,
moving in together and our future...

204
00:12:19,365 --> 00:12:22,199
...and, you know, what makes sense
as we move forward and...

205
00:12:23,937 --> 00:12:25,836
...well...

206
00:12:27,306 --> 00:12:28,864
...we decided to get married.

207
00:12:31,777 --> 00:12:33,769
- And I'm deaf.
- I'm so excited!

208
00:12:34,247 --> 00:12:36,441
- Everybody is looking.
- Sorry!

209
00:12:36,615 --> 00:12:38,642
I'm so sorry, everyone...

210
00:12:38,817 --> 00:12:41,946
...but this is my friend
and she just got engaged.

211
00:12:42,121 --> 00:12:47,286
And she has been going out
with the man for 10 years.

212
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:52,792
I'm mortified.

213
00:12:52,966 --> 00:12:56,060
There is literally a ringing in my ear.

214
00:12:57,503 --> 00:12:58,969
And the big news
was about to go bicoastal.

215
00:12:59,138 --> 00:13:00,161
Samantha Jones.

216
00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:04,436
Well, I made a little decision
I hope you'll be happy about.

217
00:13:04,612 --> 00:13:09,446
- Oh, honey, you finally got Botox.
- No, I did not get Botox.

218
00:13:09,615 --> 00:13:13,109
-I'm telling you,Carrie,you're gonna love it.
-I did not call...

219
00:13:13,286 --> 00:13:15,948
...to talk about Botox.
- Well, I'm just saying.

220
00:13:16,122 --> 00:13:18,351
So last week...

221
00:13:18,525 --> 00:13:21,890
...after the auction,
I started thinking about my options.

222
00:13:22,061 --> 00:13:25,155
- Right.
- And, um...

223
00:13:27,633 --> 00:13:30,193
Well, Big and I decided
to get married.

224
00:13:31,272 --> 00:13:34,240
- Really?
- Yeah.

225
00:13:34,609 --> 00:13:37,303
Well, that's great.

226
00:13:38,012 --> 00:13:39,875
You sounded more excited
about the Botox.

227
00:13:40,046 --> 00:13:43,345
Honey, I am excited for you,
but you know me.

228
00:13:43,517 --> 00:13:45,506
I don't really believe in marriage.

229
00:13:45,685 --> 00:13:49,348
Now, Botox, on the other hand,
that works every time.

230
00:13:49,522 --> 00:13:51,455
Honey, I... I gotta go.

231
00:13:51,624 --> 00:13:54,023
We can catch up
when I'm in town next week.

232
00:14:07,107 --> 00:14:08,131
Hello.

233
00:14:08,908 --> 00:14:10,375
I think I was in shock.

234
00:14:10,945 --> 00:14:13,174
I mean, it's you getting married.

235
00:14:13,346 --> 00:14:15,575
This is not some
random person, it's you.

236
00:14:15,749 --> 00:14:16,773
Yeah, I hear you.

237
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:20,579
I thought that after that big mess with
Aidan, you'd never wanna get married.

238
00:14:21,954 --> 00:14:24,889
So I put you in my
"we're never getting married" file.

239
00:14:25,057 --> 00:14:27,253
Now I'm gonna have to
take you out of that file.

240
00:14:27,426 --> 00:14:31,420
Well, I'm sorry about
all the extra paperwork.

241
00:14:31,599 --> 00:14:32,622
You'll get my bill.

242
00:14:32,798 --> 00:14:35,768
Samantha, it just feels
so different this time.

243
00:14:35,936 --> 00:14:40,703
You know, there's no clichéd
romantic kneeling on one knee.

244
00:14:40,874 --> 00:14:42,465
It's just...

245
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:47,369
...two grownups making a decision
about spending their lives together.

246
00:14:48,014 --> 00:14:50,607
Well, I'm happy for you.

247
00:14:51,283 --> 00:14:52,649
Oh, and hey, one more thing.

248
00:14:52,819 --> 00:14:57,189
I want you to be maid of honor.

249
00:14:57,357 --> 00:15:00,621
- How do you feel about that?
- The same way you feel about Botox:

250
00:15:00,794 --> 00:15:02,524
Painful and unnecessary.

251
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:07,796
-Seventy-four,75,76. Seventy-six guests.
-Seventy-five sounds better.

252
00:15:07,968 --> 00:15:11,460
A small wedding of 75 guests.

253
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:14,697
Seventy-six trombones, yes.
Seventy-six guests, no.

254
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,865
As a wedding gift,
Charlotte had given me...

255
00:15:17,043 --> 00:15:19,670
...Anthony Marantino,
friend and wedding planner.

256
00:15:19,847 --> 00:15:21,473
All right.

257
00:15:21,947 --> 00:15:23,778
Well, that's...

258
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,947
Cutthroat. I love it.
I hope you're this decisive...

259
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,056
...when it comes to location and the dress.
- I found the dress.

260
00:15:30,224 --> 00:15:32,623
- What? When?
- Yeah, the other day. I have it.

261
00:15:34,862 --> 00:15:38,319
- This is gonna be good.
- I am so excited.

262
00:15:38,498 --> 00:15:40,329
Okay.

263
00:15:40,835 --> 00:15:42,699
Here it is.

264
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,470
That was the exact reaction
I was aiming for.

265
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:53,142
It's pretty, but it's... It's so simple.

266
00:15:53,313 --> 00:15:55,213
It's simple and classic.

267
00:15:55,382 --> 00:16:00,478
When I saw it, I thought,
"That is what I should marry Big in. "

268
00:16:00,654 --> 00:16:04,954
- Well, who's it by? What's the label?
- No one. I found it at a vintage shop.

269
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,654
The bride wore a dress by no one.

270
00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:11,422
Oh, come on,
you know I'm gonna merchandise it up...

271
00:16:11,599 --> 00:16:13,998
...style it up with some shoes.
- Right.

272
00:16:15,236 --> 00:16:17,170
The invitation is fancier than the dress.

273
00:16:17,337 --> 00:16:19,305
- I heard that.
- I meant you to.

274
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,897
Don't tell anyone.

275
00:16:31,184 --> 00:16:34,951
- "The ultimate single gal, Carrie
Bradshaw, will be married in Manolos...

276
00:16:35,123 --> 00:16:39,683
...to New York financier
John James Preston come fall. "

277
00:16:39,859 --> 00:16:43,023
- Our wedding's on Page Six.
- Who would put that in there?

278
00:16:43,196 --> 00:16:48,498
"Proving to single gals everywhere
that there can be a happy ending over 40."

279
00:16:50,938 --> 00:16:52,426
- Carrie.
- Congratulations.

280
00:16:52,605 --> 00:16:56,099
It seemed everywhere I went,
people had seen Page Six.

281
00:16:56,277 --> 00:17:00,237
Even people you didn't expect,
like my Vogue editor, Enid.

282
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,974
We're putting together
our annual age issue...

283
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,640
...and we'd like you to do 40.

284
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:07,081
- Great. Who am I interviewing?
- No.

285
00:17:07,253 --> 00:17:09,347
You. You are 40.

286
00:17:09,524 --> 00:17:13,219
I want you to be featured in
the magazine as the 40-year-old...

287
00:17:13,394 --> 00:17:16,055
And here's the brilliant twist.
- Bride.

288
00:17:18,065 --> 00:17:21,363
Wait, I'm...
I would be in the magazine?

289
00:17:21,535 --> 00:17:24,992
In bridal couture.
It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity...

290
00:17:25,172 --> 00:17:30,303
...so spare me a week of
faux soul-searching and just say yes.

291
00:17:30,477 --> 00:17:33,877
Enid, I am so very flattered,
but honestly, I...

292
00:17:34,047 --> 00:17:35,776
Carrie, Vogue designers.

293
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,609
Vogue photographers.

294
00:17:37,785 --> 00:17:39,411
Vogue airbrushing.

295
00:17:40,054 --> 00:17:42,921
Nod your head. Yes.

296
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,087
Thank you. It will be a sensation.

297
00:17:48,263 --> 00:17:50,730
We're calling it "The Last Single Girl. "

298
00:17:50,898 --> 00:17:54,925
Well, I'm hardly the last single girl.

299
00:17:55,103 --> 00:17:59,298
No, but 40 is the last age a woman
can be photographed in a wedding gown...

300
00:17:59,474 --> 00:18:02,374
...without the unintended
Diane Arbus subtext.

301
00:18:02,544 --> 00:18:06,037
I thought the issue was
"Great Style at Every Age. "

302
00:18:06,214 --> 00:18:09,307
Style, yes. Bride, no.

303
00:18:14,153 --> 00:18:16,314
- Is that better?
- Just your typical Wednesday.

304
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:18,958
Hanging out with old friends
like Stanford Blatch...

305
00:18:19,592 --> 00:18:22,495
...and new friends like Vera Wang.

306
00:18:22,665 --> 00:18:26,258
She's looking at home for someone
who didn't think she had the bride gene.

307
00:18:26,432 --> 00:18:29,162
- Well, I guess with the right man...
- And the right dress.

308
00:18:29,703 --> 00:18:33,162
When I get married, I'm wearing
something like that, only bigger.

309
00:18:34,441 --> 00:18:35,931
Beauty. Hot.

310
00:18:36,478 --> 00:18:38,000
Love the veil.

311
00:18:38,178 --> 00:18:40,476
And Carolina Herrera.

312
00:18:43,118 --> 00:18:45,518
- Nothing fancy, but it's beautiful.
Good work.

313
00:18:45,686 --> 00:18:46,777
Great, let's do it.

314
00:18:57,999 --> 00:19:00,193
And Christian Lacroix.

315
00:19:09,678 --> 00:19:10,975
And Lanvin.

316
00:19:15,951 --> 00:19:16,974
And Dior.

317
00:19:25,727 --> 00:19:28,286
And Oscar de la Renta.

318
00:19:32,198 --> 00:19:36,500
And finally, Vivienne Westwood.

319
00:19:36,672 --> 00:19:39,003
A dress so special...

320
00:19:39,174 --> 00:19:44,167
...it could bring a wedding tear from
even the most unbelieving of women.

321
00:19:50,317 --> 00:19:54,584
And then, the impossible happened.

322
00:20:20,848 --> 00:20:22,213
And just like that...

323
00:20:22,384 --> 00:20:26,444
...Vivienne Westwood
kicked my sweet little suit's ass.

324
00:20:35,528 --> 00:20:37,224
Can I lean?

325
00:20:44,271 --> 00:20:47,402
Are you the last person in New York
still taking out library books?

326
00:20:47,575 --> 00:20:49,874
I love the smell.

327
00:20:51,112 --> 00:20:52,545
Mm.

328
00:20:53,781 --> 00:20:56,750
Oh. That's an oldie.

329
00:20:57,218 --> 00:20:59,652
"Love Letters of Great Men,
Volume One. "

330
00:20:59,822 --> 00:21:01,880
- Oh, am I in there?
- No, no.

331
00:21:02,057 --> 00:21:06,187
But some of your classmates are,
like Voltaire, Napoleon.

332
00:21:07,762 --> 00:21:11,925
- Young lady, you need to get glasses.
- No, I don't. I have yours.

333
00:21:12,099 --> 00:21:14,329
Okay, here's Napoleon.

334
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:18,432
"My dearest Josephine,
I wake consumed with thoughts of you. "

335
00:21:18,607 --> 00:21:21,839
Typical short guy.
Gives it all away upfront.

336
00:21:22,144 --> 00:21:25,113
- Why are you reading this?
- It's research for my new book.

337
00:21:25,281 --> 00:21:28,875
- Oh. What's it about?
- Love.

338
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:30,677
I used to write about finding love.

339
00:21:30,853 --> 00:21:34,254
Now I wanna write about
what happens after you've found it.

340
00:21:34,423 --> 00:21:36,185
Interesting.

341
00:21:36,357 --> 00:21:39,588
- What happens?
- Mm. Stay tuned.

342
00:21:40,261 --> 00:21:42,525
Oh, here, listen. It's Beethoven.

343
00:21:42,698 --> 00:21:45,063
Bring it, Ludwig.

344
00:21:46,702 --> 00:21:50,160
"My thoughts go out to you,
my immortal beloved.

345
00:21:50,339 --> 00:21:54,138
I can live only wholly with you
or not at all. "

346
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,641
Good stuff.

347
00:21:55,811 --> 00:21:58,176
"Be calm my life, my all.

348
00:21:58,347 --> 00:22:01,180
Only by calm consideration
of our existence...

349
00:22:01,351 --> 00:22:04,147
...can we achieve
our purpose to live together.

350
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,753
Oh, continue to love me.
Never misjudge...

351
00:22:06,921 --> 00:22:09,856
...the most faithful heart of your beloved.

352
00:22:10,024 --> 00:22:15,154
Ever thine. Ever mine. Ever ours. "

353
00:22:19,101 --> 00:22:21,500
Have you ever written me a love letter?

354
00:22:21,668 --> 00:22:23,136
Does a love fax count?

355
00:22:24,038 --> 00:22:28,169
- When have I ever gotten a love fax?
- Oh, I'm sure my secretary sent you one...

356
00:22:28,344 --> 00:22:30,675
...at some point.
- Yeah.

357
00:22:31,146 --> 00:22:34,241
What can I tell you, baby?
It's not my style.

358
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:37,782
Besides, those guys had to write.
They were separated from their loves...

359
00:22:37,952 --> 00:22:41,615
...by wars
and hundreds and hundreds of miles.

360
00:22:41,789 --> 00:22:43,917
I'm right here.

361
00:22:44,094 --> 00:22:46,028
Hello.

362
00:22:47,496 --> 00:22:51,591
- You make me very happy.
- Yeah, yeah. Put it in writing.

363
00:22:52,735 --> 00:22:57,399
With my mind prenuptially preoccupied,
I became delinquent with my library books.

364
00:22:57,573 --> 00:23:01,374
So now the tragic love stories
of Wuthering Heights and Love Story...

365
00:23:01,545 --> 00:23:03,670
...were going to cost me
more than a few tears.

366
00:23:03,846 --> 00:23:05,836
Excuse me, which way is the wedding?

367
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,980
Up the stairs.

368
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,053
It was perfect.

369
00:23:21,231 --> 00:23:24,255
Big and I would be married
in the classic New York landmark...

370
00:23:24,433 --> 00:23:28,199
...that housed all the great love stories.

371
00:23:31,374 --> 00:23:33,169
Where is the waiter with the check?

372
00:23:33,341 --> 00:23:36,936
Jeez, Miranda, relax.
Magda hasn't even finished yet.

373
00:23:37,112 --> 00:23:39,739
I still have a brief to work on
when I get home.

374
00:23:39,914 --> 00:23:43,475
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- I'll take him.

375
00:23:43,653 --> 00:23:44,710
Thank you, Magda.

376
00:23:45,653 --> 00:23:49,420
We're gonna wash that beautiful face.
Come, darling.

377
00:23:51,794 --> 00:23:52,817
What?

378
00:23:52,995 --> 00:23:55,463
We can't let the hard-working nanny
finish her supper?

379
00:23:55,632 --> 00:23:59,260
I'm sorry, I'm exhausted.
Brady woke me up at 5 a. m.

380
00:23:59,435 --> 00:24:02,460
- Hey, he woke me up too.
- Yeah.

381
00:24:02,638 --> 00:24:05,435
We gotta stop letting Brady
come into our bed.

382
00:24:09,813 --> 00:24:11,677
You got milk on your top lip.

383
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:14,610
What now?

384
00:24:14,784 --> 00:24:18,083
- It's like you're always criticizing me.
- I am not.

385
00:24:19,021 --> 00:24:23,185
You wanna go through life with foam
on your lip and no one ever telling you?

386
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:33,029
Anything you wanna tell me?

387
00:24:40,109 --> 00:24:42,976
Hm. Is there anything you wanna tell me?

388
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:54,113
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Wait. Wait. Don't come already.

389
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:57,849
- Yeah.
- No, wait. Get on top.

390
00:24:58,026 --> 00:25:00,655
Let's just get it over with.

391
00:25:04,867 --> 00:25:08,303
I mean, we gotta get up
in four and a half hours.

392
00:25:09,506 --> 00:25:12,962
We never have sex
and you wanna get it over with?

393
00:25:18,182 --> 00:25:22,049
- Steve, we have sex.
- When was the last time we had sex?

394
00:25:23,019 --> 00:25:24,814
Um...

395
00:25:27,557 --> 00:25:30,390
There was snow on the ground.

396
00:25:36,901 --> 00:25:39,595
- How often do you guys have sex?
- Sex.

397
00:25:39,769 --> 00:25:41,565
- Miranda, please.
- What?

398
00:25:42,038 --> 00:25:44,165
She's 3.
She doesn't know what it means.

399
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:46,331
I'm 41 and I still don't know
what it means.

400
00:25:46,508 --> 00:25:48,772
I know, but she is repeating everything.

401
00:25:48,945 --> 00:25:53,075
If I'd known the girl talk was gonna be on
lockdown, I wouldn't have flown 3000 miles.

402
00:25:53,248 --> 00:25:55,877
No, we can talk.
Let's just not use that word.

403
00:25:56,519 --> 00:26:00,045
Fine. How often do you guys...?

404
00:26:00,223 --> 00:26:01,917
- Color?
- Thank you.

405
00:26:02,091 --> 00:26:06,425
Well, I can't color enough.
I could color all day every day.

406
00:26:06,597 --> 00:26:10,691
If I had my way,
I would use every crayon in my box.

407
00:26:10,868 --> 00:26:14,099
We get it. You love to color.

408
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:16,032
Why are you asking?

409
00:26:16,205 --> 00:26:21,405
Well, last night Steve and I were coloring,
and I was just about to...

410
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:24,341
Come.
I'm sorry, there's no crayon equivalent.

411
00:26:24,513 --> 00:26:28,040
And he wanted to switch positions
and I said:

412
00:26:29,052 --> 00:26:30,610
"Let's just get it over with. "

413
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:35,783
- He kept trying to make it last longer.
- This is bad?

414
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:38,827
- It is when you have a full-time job.
- I have a full-time job.

415
00:26:38,996 --> 00:26:41,829
You don't also have a 5-year-old,
play dates, PTA meetings...

416
00:26:41,999 --> 00:26:45,434
...and a mother-in-law in a rest home
with advancing Alzheimer's.

417
00:26:45,602 --> 00:26:48,799
We're just going through
a no-coloring phase.

418
00:26:48,973 --> 00:26:51,770
- It comes and goes, right?
Every couple is different.

419
00:26:52,175 --> 00:26:54,666
Harry and I make love
two, three times a week.

420
00:26:54,843 --> 00:26:58,074
- Great, now I feel worse.
- Well, when was the last time for you?

421
00:27:00,084 --> 00:27:02,176
- Six months ago.
- Oh, my.

422
00:27:03,454 --> 00:27:05,444
It sounds long.

423
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:08,592
- But... But that's a dry spell.
- I bet it is.

424
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:12,159
Hey, Carrie. What about you and Big?

425
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,655
Come on. I told. Tell.

426
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:17,059
Mm-mm.

427
00:27:17,234 --> 00:27:19,200
But I will tell you this.

428
00:27:19,369 --> 00:27:21,132
When Big colors...

429
00:27:22,704 --> 00:27:26,104
...he rarely stays inside the lines.

430
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:28,766
Well, this has been very helpful.

431
00:27:38,555 --> 00:27:40,386
John?

432
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,424
- Hey.
- Come here.

433
00:27:57,607 --> 00:28:00,404
Totally outside the lines.

434
00:28:08,351 --> 00:28:11,718
Well, send it to Smith Jerrod
at the office address.

435
00:28:12,188 --> 00:28:14,520
I gotta go. Something just came up.

436
00:28:16,626 --> 00:28:20,527
- I got a gift for you.
- So far, I like it.

437
00:28:29,005 --> 00:28:30,336
How'd...?

438
00:28:30,908 --> 00:28:34,036
Wait. That was you on the phone
at the auction.

439
00:28:34,211 --> 00:28:38,341
- I knew how much you wanted it.
- But I was gonna buy it for myself.

440
00:28:38,749 --> 00:28:40,578
Well, I wanted to give it to you.

441
00:28:41,452 --> 00:28:43,578
For our anniversary.

442
00:28:43,753 --> 00:28:45,744
We met five years ago today.

443
00:28:47,257 --> 00:28:48,623
Right.

444
00:28:49,693 --> 00:28:51,024
Do you like it?

445
00:28:51,194 --> 00:28:54,094
Well, just to be clear,
this is a ring with diamonds...

446
00:28:54,264 --> 00:28:57,029
...it's not a diamond ring, right?
- Yeah.

447
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,327
Well, in that case, I love it.

448
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:03,871
It's my second favorite thing
I've ever found in there.

449
00:29:05,609 --> 00:29:10,273
Now, my gift is a little bit more oral.

450
00:29:11,715 --> 00:29:16,617
- Babe, I have to go to bed.
- Bed? It's 7:30.

451
00:29:16,787 --> 00:29:20,482
I have to be at the studio by 6 a. m.
And I need to get a workout in before that.

452
00:29:20,657 --> 00:29:22,319
You see, this is how it starts.

453
00:29:22,493 --> 00:29:26,825
Next thing you know, we're only
having sex three or four times a week.

454
00:29:56,827 --> 00:30:00,787
And that is how Samantha learned
she had a new neighbor.

455
00:30:01,698 --> 00:30:04,599
From then on, night after night...

456
00:30:04,768 --> 00:30:07,327
...while Smith got his beauty sleep...

457
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:14,040
...Samantha found something
more interesting to watch than TiVo.

458
00:30:18,215 --> 00:30:21,012
- Keep going.
- Okay.

459
00:30:22,085 --> 00:30:24,213
- Keep them closed.
- Okay.

460
00:30:25,689 --> 00:30:29,022
Okay. Open them.

461
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:33,386
Double doors.

462
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:35,998
So far, so good.

463
00:30:46,379 --> 00:30:48,505
Oh, my God.

464
00:30:51,782 --> 00:30:56,515
- Oh, you did me proud, mister.
- You like it?

465
00:30:57,922 --> 00:30:58,979
"Like it?"

466
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:05,988
It's love at first sight.

467
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:08,357
Oh, my.

468
00:31:08,532 --> 00:31:11,764
Here. Wait.

469
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:13,459
Hold this.

470
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:24,111
Now I believe this is all really happening.

471
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:27,107
I can't believe it sold so fast.

472
00:31:27,284 --> 00:31:30,152
- It's a sign.
- Yeah, it's a sign I priced it too low.

473
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:34,922
Hey, that's the food. Will you buzz
them in? And money's on the table.

474
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:38,425
I'm gonna get started on the closet.
I should be done in about 17 years.

475
00:31:38,595 --> 00:31:41,893
All right. Pink Post-it: Take.

476
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:45,358
Purple: Toss. Yellow: Storage.

477
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:47,937
Oh, you're very good friends.

478
00:31:53,877 --> 00:31:55,674
Oh, my God.

479
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:01,447
- I can't believe it.
Lily, look who it is. Aunt Samantha.

480
00:32:03,889 --> 00:32:07,483
- What are you doing here?
- A lot of shit went down in this place.

481
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:10,184
Attention must be paid.

482
00:32:10,761 --> 00:32:11,852
Ah.

483
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,456
Really, champagne.

484
00:32:23,576 --> 00:32:25,475
- Remember this?
- Oh, yeah.

485
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:28,942
While Samantha put on
The Best of the '80s...

486
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:33,282
...I put on the worst.

487
00:32:40,457 --> 00:32:42,084
Banana clip.

488
00:32:45,864 --> 00:32:47,626
Yeah.

489
00:32:48,198 --> 00:32:49,826
Work it.

490
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,593
Madonna.

491
00:32:53,773 --> 00:32:56,968
Whoo, whoo!

492
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,007
No fun.

493
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,302
Aw.

494
00:34:02,674 --> 00:34:04,437
Work it harder.

495
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,345
Oh, man.

496
00:34:27,534 --> 00:34:29,022
- Come here.
- Come here.

497
00:34:29,202 --> 00:34:31,532
Come on, don't be shy.
Come on.

498
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:42,907
It took four friends three days...

499
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:47,176
...to put 20 years into 38 boxes.

500
00:35:28,594 --> 00:35:30,721
While I run over
to see your mother tomorrow...

501
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:33,831
...maybe you could take Brady
by the first birthday party alone.

502
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:38,697
And then I'll meet you at the twins' party,
and you can leave and be at the bar by 6.

503
00:35:39,605 --> 00:35:41,004
What's the matter?

504
00:35:43,242 --> 00:35:45,674
I had sex with someone else.

505
00:35:48,581 --> 00:35:51,448
And you're so amazing...

506
00:35:52,084 --> 00:35:54,848
...and I don't know how
I could do that to you.

507
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:58,749
You and I hadn't had sex
in a really long time and I...

508
00:35:58,924 --> 00:36:00,254
God.

509
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:03,318
It didn't mean anything.
It just happened once.

510
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,190
And it's been killing me.

511
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:09,027
It's killing you?

512
00:36:09,201 --> 00:36:10,463
It just happened.

513
00:36:11,237 --> 00:36:13,932
L... I...

514
00:36:14,106 --> 00:36:15,937
I... I... I wasn't thinking.

515
00:36:16,241 --> 00:36:18,904
Do not follow me.

516
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:32,214
Scout, off.

517
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:42,897
Miranda, it's still me.

518
00:36:46,373 --> 00:36:47,999
Is it?

519
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:04,253
Steve. I just... I can't believe it.

520
00:37:04,724 --> 00:37:06,883
- That's what I said.
Yes, it's sad.

521
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:10,152
But I'm not gonna make it any sadder
by staying at a bad hotel...

522
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:13,197
...while I look for a place.
Could you pass the salt?

523
00:37:13,367 --> 00:37:15,767
Plus, I have to be downtown
and close to Brooklyn.

524
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:18,768
We're gonna keep Brady's life
as normal as we possibly can.

525
00:37:18,938 --> 00:37:21,964
I'm gonna have him on my days
and Steve will have him on his...

526
00:37:22,142 --> 00:37:24,871
...and Magda will shuttle
back and forth between.

527
00:37:25,044 --> 00:37:28,036
Well, I don't really know
if this question is allowed...

528
00:37:28,214 --> 00:37:29,875
...but how is Steve handling this?

529
00:37:30,049 --> 00:37:32,985
Says he's devastated,
begs me to forgive him.

530
00:37:33,153 --> 00:37:35,746
It's not gonna happen.
I can barely even look at him.

531
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,047
Miranda, honey,
are you sure you wanna do this?

532
00:37:38,557 --> 00:37:40,957
It's just one time.
Anyone can have a slip.

533
00:37:41,127 --> 00:37:45,222
Even if I could get my mind around that
justification, it's the cheating part.

534
00:37:45,665 --> 00:37:49,567
The behind-my-back part, the violation
of the trust. That's what's killing me.

535
00:37:58,778 --> 00:38:01,210
Thank you for being you.

536
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:07,943
Charlotte made love to Harry
four times that week.

537
00:38:08,122 --> 00:38:11,454
Okay. Wedding crunch time.
We need to get really serious here.

538
00:38:12,825 --> 00:38:15,591
Okay, not now.
I just got an e-mail from our contractor.

539
00:38:15,763 --> 00:38:18,390
He's pushed the move-in date yet again.

540
00:38:18,565 --> 00:38:20,464
- I gotta write this guy and...
- No, no, no.

541
00:38:20,634 --> 00:38:24,433
No. Wedding before contractor, all right?

542
00:38:24,606 --> 00:38:29,302
Unless you're planning to invite him,
which would make the guest list 201.

543
00:38:31,043 --> 00:38:34,068
Two hundred?
Jesus, Carrie, it went up again?

544
00:38:34,247 --> 00:38:37,239
- It's the dress.
- You said 75 people.

545
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:41,146
How can I explain this?

546
00:38:42,923 --> 00:38:44,514
Look...

547
00:38:44,991 --> 00:38:46,959
...you play poker, right?

548
00:38:47,127 --> 00:38:49,186
Well, the dress upped the ante.

549
00:38:51,332 --> 00:38:52,764
Hey.

550
00:38:54,501 --> 00:38:57,469
How you doing on your vows?

551
00:38:57,637 --> 00:39:02,301
A reminder. You'll be saying these in front
of a lot of people, so the pressure is on.

552
00:39:02,475 --> 00:39:04,374
All right, up. I have to finish this. Up.

553
00:39:04,544 --> 00:39:06,205
- Hey.
- I don't have time for this.

554
00:39:06,378 --> 00:39:10,839
- You're not taking it seriously.
- No, no, I'm not. It is a circus.

555
00:39:15,522 --> 00:39:17,386
Two hundred people?

556
00:39:17,557 --> 00:39:19,821
Page Six?

557
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:28,059
This is my third marriage.
How do you think that makes me look?

558
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:39,670
I didn't know that was even an issue.

559
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,711
So why didn't you say anything sooner?

560
00:39:47,621 --> 00:39:51,351
- You wanted all of this.
- Well, yeah.

561
00:39:51,859 --> 00:39:54,088
- But don't you want...?
- I want you.

562
00:39:54,395 --> 00:39:55,885
That's what I want.

563
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:00,494
I could have just gone down to city hall.

564
00:40:20,286 --> 00:40:23,119
I think it's too late for city hall now.

565
00:40:24,325 --> 00:40:27,317
Well, no, I wasn't suggesting that...

566
00:40:27,494 --> 00:40:28,791
I was just saying.

567
00:40:31,664 --> 00:40:34,565
See, that's the face...

568
00:40:34,735 --> 00:40:37,795
...I've been trying to avoid.

569
00:40:38,672 --> 00:40:40,401
Come here.

570
00:40:46,847 --> 00:40:49,644
You're a great man-friend.

571
00:40:53,153 --> 00:40:57,851
And soon,
it was the night before the big day.

572
00:41:00,027 --> 00:41:02,051
There they are.

573
00:41:20,214 --> 00:41:23,182
Now, I know it's tradition
at the rehearsal dinner...

574
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:28,151
...for the maid of honor to reveal
embarrassing things about the bride.

575
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:33,188
But in our group, we never kiss and tell.

576
00:41:34,496 --> 00:41:38,487
- So I'd like to make a toast to the groom.
- There's a word he's heard before.

577
00:41:42,201 --> 00:41:44,830
- Who's that guy again?
- Karl. He's a partner at the firm.

578
00:41:45,005 --> 00:41:46,028
Karl's kind of a jerk.

579
00:41:46,207 --> 00:41:48,264
You know what they say,
three time's a charm.

580
00:41:48,441 --> 00:41:50,671
Hey, dickwad, I'm speaking.

581
00:41:53,147 --> 00:41:56,014
- Yeah, Samantha.
- Yeah.

582
00:41:58,351 --> 00:42:02,788
Now, there were times when we had
our doubts about this gorgeous man.

583
00:42:02,956 --> 00:42:07,415
But after careful observation
over the last hundred years...

584
00:42:07,594 --> 00:42:09,720
...my doubts are over.

585
00:42:09,897 --> 00:42:12,889
So here's to the groom...

586
00:42:13,067 --> 00:42:16,400
...a man who finally got "Carrie-d" away.

587
00:42:16,571 --> 00:42:18,628
Aww.

588
00:42:18,805 --> 00:42:20,067
Here's hoping, John.

589
00:42:20,373 --> 00:42:22,501
That guy is a jackass. Here.

590
00:42:22,677 --> 00:42:24,575
- Cheers.
- That was really nice. Thank you.

591
00:42:24,744 --> 00:42:26,871
There's nothing like
an illegal Cuban cigar...

592
00:42:27,047 --> 00:42:29,606
...after dinner, huh?
Exactly.

593
00:42:29,783 --> 00:42:31,875
So that was quite a toast, Samantha.

594
00:42:32,052 --> 00:42:33,314
Well, you're quite a guy.

595
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,248
Oh, my God, there's a cab.
Oh, yeah.

596
00:42:35,423 --> 00:42:37,413
- Hey, buddy, hold on.
- Get it.

597
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,487
Steve.

598
00:42:41,196 --> 00:42:44,891
- I don't wanna bother you all.
- You're not bothering us.

599
00:42:46,334 --> 00:42:47,995
But...

600
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:51,297
...I need to talk to Miranda.

601
00:42:51,905 --> 00:42:54,396
Samantha, could you ask her
to come out?

602
00:42:54,574 --> 00:42:56,873
I don't wanna go in. It's a party and all.

603
00:42:57,811 --> 00:42:59,175
Sure.

604
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:06,884
Hey. I haven't talked to you all night.

605
00:43:07,055 --> 00:43:08,613
Steve's here.

606
00:43:12,426 --> 00:43:15,191
They're not poodles.
You know what I mean.

607
00:43:15,764 --> 00:43:19,597
Hey, guys. Would you give us...?

608
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,330
Yeah, sure, going in.

609
00:43:25,572 --> 00:43:27,335
You're all right?

610
00:43:35,116 --> 00:43:38,950
You didn't leave me any choice.
You won't return my calls.

611
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:42,180
You only talk to me in front of the baby
and I can't say anything.

612
00:43:42,357 --> 00:43:45,723
What could you possibly have to say
that could make it any better?

613
00:43:46,194 --> 00:43:51,290
- Please. It was just that one time.
- You broke us!

614
00:43:51,466 --> 00:43:54,399
You broke us. What we had is broken.

615
00:43:56,069 --> 00:43:57,730
What the fuck is happening?

616
00:44:04,979 --> 00:44:07,708
I changed who I was for you.

617
00:44:14,354 --> 00:44:15,821
Hey.

618
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:19,858
- Are you all right?
- No, I'm not all right.

619
00:44:20,428 --> 00:44:25,295
You two are crazy to get married.
Marriage ruins everything.

620
00:44:36,044 --> 00:44:40,845
Hey. There you are.
I thought you'd skipped out on me.

621
00:44:41,016 --> 00:44:42,142
No.

622
00:44:42,317 --> 00:44:45,183
Well, the all-gal sleepover's
about to commence.

623
00:44:51,058 --> 00:44:53,687
Hey, is everything okay?

624
00:44:53,863 --> 00:44:56,421
Yeah. I'm just tired, I guess.

625
00:44:56,598 --> 00:44:58,897
All right. Well, go home and go to sleep.

626
00:44:59,068 --> 00:45:01,968
But first give me a kiss good night
and make it a good one...

627
00:45:02,304 --> 00:45:06,604
...because it's the last single-girl kiss.

628
00:45:09,043 --> 00:45:13,069
- I always knew she would marry Big.
- Oh, you did not.

629
00:45:13,248 --> 00:45:15,580
- That's crazy.
- Yes, I did.

630
00:45:15,749 --> 00:45:20,119
After every breakup I secretly thought,
"Nope. They belong together. "

631
00:45:20,288 --> 00:45:22,221
You thought that
after the second breakup?

632
00:45:22,389 --> 00:45:24,084
- Yup.
- After the fifteenth?

633
00:45:24,259 --> 00:45:27,228
Ha-ha. That's hilarious.
We broke up a lot.

634
00:45:27,395 --> 00:45:30,922
Yeah, but after the breakups
comes the hot make-up sex.

635
00:45:34,002 --> 00:45:37,459
Hey, you wanna get that? Open up.

636
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:40,201
- Now say something.
- Sex.

637
00:45:44,546 --> 00:45:47,014
Are you sure she's not my child?

638
00:45:47,681 --> 00:45:49,842
- Hello?
- It's me.

639
00:45:50,019 --> 00:45:52,417
Oh, my God, did you just hear Lily?

640
00:45:52,586 --> 00:45:55,350
- I need to talk.
- What?

641
00:45:55,521 --> 00:46:01,189
I'm sitting here
trying to write these vows and...

642
00:46:02,331 --> 00:46:04,627
Is this something we really wanna do?

643
00:46:05,968 --> 00:46:09,403
Hey, you know what? You guys, it's Big.
I'm gonna... I'm gonna take it.

644
00:46:10,204 --> 00:46:13,537
Get some sleep, groomie.

645
00:46:17,545 --> 00:46:20,514
- What's the matter?
- It's just...

646
00:46:20,847 --> 00:46:24,079
...everything is great as it is.

647
00:46:24,987 --> 00:46:27,820
- I don't wanna screw it up.
- You won't.

648
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:30,287
I screwed it up twice before.

649
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,256
Here's the thing.

650
00:46:33,762 --> 00:46:39,131
This is me you're marrying tomorrow.
Me. It's nobody else.

651
00:46:40,035 --> 00:46:43,266
- Yeah?
- And I'm marrying you.

652
00:46:43,438 --> 00:46:44,962
It's me and you.

653
00:46:45,374 --> 00:46:48,308
And do you wanna hear
the great news there?

654
00:46:48,476 --> 00:46:49,499
Yeah.

655
00:46:49,678 --> 00:46:52,510
We've both already done
everything we can to screw it up.

656
00:46:54,249 --> 00:46:57,876
- Is that a smile I'm hearing?
- Yeah.

657
00:46:58,053 --> 00:47:02,489
It sounds to me like you've got
a bit of writer's block on the vow front.

658
00:47:02,658 --> 00:47:03,785
Yeah.

659
00:47:03,959 --> 00:47:06,825
And I find, you know,
as a professional writer...

660
00:47:06,996 --> 00:47:10,896
...that it's best to just, you know...

661
00:47:11,066 --> 00:47:14,694
...just stop thinking about it so much
and go to bed.

662
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:16,928
And in the morning...

663
00:47:17,104 --> 00:47:20,336
- You'll know what to do.
- Exactly.

664
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:23,638
And if not, then just write this:

665
00:47:23,813 --> 00:47:25,438
I will love you.

666
00:47:25,614 --> 00:47:27,708
Simple, to the point...

667
00:47:27,883 --> 00:47:32,182
...and I swear I won't even
try to take credit for it.

668
00:47:34,123 --> 00:47:36,615
So you're gonna go to bed now, right?

669
00:47:37,427 --> 00:47:40,986
Okay. Good night.

670
00:47:41,162 --> 00:47:44,221
I'll see you tomorrow. And hey...

671
00:47:45,433 --> 00:47:47,527
...it's me and you.

672
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:23,198
Now, there's a bride.

673
00:48:29,279 --> 00:48:31,405
Before we leave, we're gonna
pick up our flowers, right, girls?

674
00:48:32,981 --> 00:48:35,848
Miranda, you're gonna have the dahlias.
Samantha, you have the roses.

675
00:48:36,019 --> 00:48:39,681
- And Charlotte...
We can take care of it.

676
00:48:40,889 --> 00:48:42,584
Hello?

677
00:48:43,393 --> 00:48:46,155
Could you put Carrie
on the phone, please?

678
00:48:47,694 --> 00:48:48,958
Hello?

679
00:48:54,771 --> 00:48:57,705
Who let the dogs out?
Get these dogs out of here!

680
00:48:57,874 --> 00:49:01,537
That's all we need is the lift of a leg
on the train of a dress.

681
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:04,075
Could you open this door, please?

682
00:49:04,246 --> 00:49:07,114
- Wait, wait, hold it.
I'm trying to find out...

683
00:49:07,284 --> 00:49:08,579
- Oh, my God.
Hey.

684
00:49:08,752 --> 00:49:10,946
- The girls are in this car.
- All of us together?

685
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:14,088
All of you together.
Okay? Come on, lift it up. Let's go.

686
00:49:14,255 --> 00:49:16,122
Hey, it's Carrie. Leave me a message.

687
00:49:16,293 --> 00:49:20,285
- See you then. Bye-bye.
Just so beautiful.

688
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,127
Blue.
Yes, sir.

689
00:49:26,302 --> 00:49:29,600
- Red and black.
Okay, I'll see you there.

690
00:49:29,772 --> 00:49:31,865
- Where's black?
- Oh, I'm coming, I'm coming.

691
00:49:32,041 --> 00:49:33,974
- You're following the red.
- I'm coming.

692
00:49:34,144 --> 00:49:36,611
Okay. Come on. Let's go.

693
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:38,939
- Ready?
- Yeah, okay, you're in.

694
00:49:39,114 --> 00:49:40,307
Okay.

695
00:49:40,481 --> 00:49:44,577
There's the bride. Look, she's dressed
like a princess, do you see?

696
00:49:44,752 --> 00:49:46,812
- Can you hold that?
- Oh, yes.

697
00:49:46,989 --> 00:49:48,423
Thank you. Okay.

698
00:49:49,092 --> 00:49:51,024
Come on, scootch over.

699
00:49:53,496 --> 00:49:56,556
It's like pushing a cream puff
through a keyhole.

700
00:49:56,732 --> 00:49:57,926
See you at the library.

701
00:49:58,101 --> 00:50:01,537
- Hey, it's Carrie. Leave me a message.
- Why haven't you called me back?

702
00:50:01,704 --> 00:50:05,366
Look, I really need to talk to you.
Call me as soon as you get this.

703
00:50:07,842 --> 00:50:10,903
No more wedding guests on these stairs,
understand? Bridal party only.

704
00:50:11,079 --> 00:50:12,308
Got it.

705
00:50:13,716 --> 00:50:16,149
We've got a problem. They're not here.

706
00:50:16,318 --> 00:50:19,116
- They're probably stuck in traffic.
- Both of them?

707
00:50:25,395 --> 00:50:30,356
- Hey, it's Carrie. Leave me a message.
- I can't go in without you.

708
00:50:32,001 --> 00:50:33,593
Baby...

709
00:50:35,104 --> 00:50:40,005
...this whole bride-and-groom thing
has really got me thrown.

710
00:50:44,646 --> 00:50:47,481
I need to know that it's still us.

711
00:50:47,651 --> 00:50:51,644
Just you and me. Like you said.

712
00:50:56,926 --> 00:50:58,723
I was putting it on.
I know.

713
00:50:58,894 --> 00:51:00,258
Good job. Beautiful.

714
00:51:01,631 --> 00:51:04,863
Come on, baby.
Turn around, let me see you.

715
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:10,232
You look so beautiful.

716
00:51:19,383 --> 00:51:20,542
It looks beautiful.

717
00:51:20,717 --> 00:51:22,581
It really does. It looks so beautiful.

718
00:51:23,619 --> 00:51:25,143
Oh, look at Mommy, here they come.

719
00:51:25,322 --> 00:51:26,583
Easy does it.
We're here.

720
00:51:26,756 --> 00:51:29,849
The traffic was the worst.
57th Street was just...

721
00:51:30,026 --> 00:51:33,895
- It's okay.
Hello. You guys look great.

722
00:51:36,164 --> 00:51:39,963
- Okay, honey, let's go upstairs.
Ready. We're ready.

723
00:51:41,504 --> 00:51:43,266
He's not here.

724
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,569
- Who's not here?
- The groom.

725
00:51:46,343 --> 00:51:47,365
What's happening?

726
00:51:49,045 --> 00:51:53,175
- Big's not here.
- But we're 25 minutes late.

727
00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:55,476
Well, did anybody call him?

728
00:51:58,721 --> 00:52:02,213
Well, give me a phone.
Somebody give me a phone.

729
00:52:06,395 --> 00:52:09,330
- All right, I don't know how to work this.
- Here, sweetie.

730
00:52:09,499 --> 00:52:11,057
Thank you.

731
00:52:21,644 --> 00:52:25,307
Hey, you know what?
Let me just look at your tie for a minute.

732
00:52:25,516 --> 00:52:27,347
Hello.
- Are you okay?

733
00:52:27,518 --> 00:52:28,917
I've been calling for an hour.

734
00:52:29,086 --> 00:52:32,577
- Why haven't you been answering?
- Because I don't know where my phone is.

735
00:52:34,057 --> 00:52:35,820
So, what's going on? Where are you?

736
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:39,490
I was out front. I just left.

737
00:52:43,167 --> 00:52:44,793
I can't do this.

738
00:52:50,039 --> 00:52:51,802
Oh, my God.

739
00:52:56,312 --> 00:52:58,507
Carrie? Carrie.

740
00:53:01,784 --> 00:53:05,777
- He's not coming. Oh, my God.
- What do you mean, "He's not coming"?

741
00:53:08,725 --> 00:53:10,625
Get me out of here.

742
00:53:10,793 --> 00:53:12,351
- Get me out of here!
- Go, go, go.

743
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:15,657
- You take her, I'll take care of all of this.
All right, all right.

744
00:53:15,833 --> 00:53:17,265
Here we go.

745
00:53:39,088 --> 00:53:41,489
What the fuck am I doing?
Turn around, go back.

746
00:53:41,659 --> 00:53:43,181
It's a one-way street.

747
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:45,987
By the time we go around the block,
she'll be gone.

748
00:53:46,162 --> 00:53:48,461
There's no one behind us. Turn around.

749
00:53:56,172 --> 00:53:59,164
- I think this is them.
- Pull over. Pull over.

750
00:54:00,611 --> 00:54:02,168
Carrie.

751
00:54:09,319 --> 00:54:13,278
Carrie. I freaked out for a minute,
but I'm ready now.

752
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:17,650
Oh, God.

753
00:54:19,864 --> 00:54:23,162
I knew
you would do this! I knew it!

754
00:54:23,333 --> 00:54:26,302
- Carrie, I'm sorry.
- I am humiliated!

755
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:29,064
I'm sorry. I'm... I'm sorry, Carrie.

756
00:54:29,239 --> 00:54:30,330
Come on. Come on.

757
00:54:31,708 --> 00:54:35,474
- Carrie, wait, I'm sorry. Carrie...
- No! No!

758
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:38,508
Come on, we're gonna get in the car.

759
00:54:39,416 --> 00:54:41,749
It's all right, it's all right.

760
00:55:03,574 --> 00:55:05,098
Let's go, man. Move it.

761
00:55:34,037 --> 00:55:37,063
I thought I would still be in extreme pain.

762
00:55:40,277 --> 00:55:42,245
I feel nothing.

763
00:55:45,016 --> 00:55:47,348
I'd like some more nothing.

764
00:55:53,323 --> 00:55:55,017
Yes, I'm still jilted.

765
00:55:56,994 --> 00:56:00,394
What the hell got into him?
He was perfectly fine at the dinner.

766
00:56:01,465 --> 00:56:03,956
I knew it when he called last night.

767
00:56:04,501 --> 00:56:07,401
- I could tell.
- Then why didn't you say anything?

768
00:56:09,507 --> 00:56:12,340
I didn't wanna believe it. I di...

769
00:56:12,511 --> 00:56:15,741
I didn't even wanna say it out loud.

770
00:56:18,282 --> 00:56:21,376
- Now I have nowhere to live.
- You'll stay here.

771
00:56:21,553 --> 00:56:22,813
Forever.

772
00:56:23,921 --> 00:56:26,446
Maybe you should eat something.

773
00:56:27,624 --> 00:56:29,922
- Anyone? Hungry?
- No.

774
00:56:31,828 --> 00:56:34,991
I can never go back there again.
How am I gonna get my clothes?

775
00:56:35,165 --> 00:56:39,329
Oh, honey, I can hire people to do all that.
Anything you need.

776
00:56:40,071 --> 00:56:41,266
A hit man?

777
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:46,139
I have nothing to wear
but a wedding gown.

778
00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:49,573
You have your honeymoon clothes here.

779
00:56:50,748 --> 00:56:53,078
Well, there's the silver lining.

780
00:56:54,985 --> 00:56:59,115
A honeymoon
at a romantic Mexican resort...

781
00:56:59,289 --> 00:57:01,223
...that's prepaid on my credit card...

782
00:57:01,391 --> 00:57:03,859
...because I wanted to surprise
the man who jilted me.

783
00:57:04,027 --> 00:57:05,688
I can get you out of that.

784
00:57:05,862 --> 00:57:08,764
Worse comes to worse,
I'll say there was a death or something.

785
00:57:08,933 --> 00:57:10,661
Wasn't there?

786
00:57:14,339 --> 00:57:17,798
Keep those eyes closed.
Keep them closed.

787
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:33,416
Charlotte.

788
00:57:33,591 --> 00:57:35,387
Come here. Come here.

789
00:57:38,428 --> 00:57:41,225
I did something really bad, I think.

790
00:57:41,933 --> 00:57:44,767
I said something to Big
at the rehearsal dinner.

791
00:57:46,305 --> 00:57:47,463
What do you mean?

792
00:57:47,639 --> 00:57:51,130
It was right after Steve showed up.
I was upset.

793
00:57:51,309 --> 00:57:55,039
Big came over to me,
and I said something like:

794
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,938
"You're crazy to get married. "

795
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:00,649
It just came out.

796
00:58:00,818 --> 00:58:04,778
- Do you think it's totally the reason?
- No.

797
00:58:04,956 --> 00:58:07,948
Big has been weird
about marriage for years.

798
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:13,621
- I keep thinking I should tell Carrie.
- No, no, no.

799
00:58:13,798 --> 00:58:17,096
This is a bad time to even mention it.

800
00:58:18,168 --> 00:58:22,901
No, no, no. Find another time later.

801
00:58:23,074 --> 00:58:24,062
Uh-huh.

802
00:58:24,243 --> 00:58:28,178
Well, it turns out, I couldn't get her
out of the honeymoon, but I got us in.

803
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:32,080
- What?
- I just booked us three seats on the flight.

804
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:34,946
Mexico, here we come.

805
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:38,154
I can't go to Mexico. I have a job.

806
00:58:46,365 --> 00:58:49,355
Jerrod. Smith Jerrod, with a J.

807
00:58:49,534 --> 00:58:53,401
That's right. Great, thank you.

808
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:58,698
- Make sure that the car is there...
- We're here, I'll call you back later.

809
00:59:01,779 --> 00:59:02,803
Welcome to Mexico.

810
00:59:08,452 --> 00:59:10,011
Do you have wi-fi? Thanks.

811
00:59:13,759 --> 00:59:16,989
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
I'm waiting for a Mr. And Mrs. Preston.

812
00:59:17,162 --> 00:59:21,325
Honey, you'll be waiting a long time.
We'll talk.

813
00:59:27,772 --> 00:59:30,672
This will kill her.

814
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:34,670
- Where is she?
- In the powder room.

815
00:59:34,847 --> 00:59:37,575
- Well, let's look around.
- Yeah.

816
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,831
And this is a master suite.

817
01:00:39,243 --> 01:00:41,177
Oh, my God.

818
01:00:41,879 --> 01:00:43,541
Here.

819
01:00:43,714 --> 01:00:45,546
You get that side.

820
01:00:47,387 --> 01:00:49,547
Where are we gonna put these?

821
01:00:50,454 --> 01:00:54,515
Here. No more honeymoon stuff.
This is very important.

822
01:01:00,866 --> 01:01:02,629
Here she comes.

823
01:01:15,914 --> 01:01:17,641
It's going to be a gorgeous sunset.

824
01:01:19,852 --> 01:01:21,114
Close the shutters.

825
01:01:28,293 --> 01:01:29,555
All of them.

826
01:01:50,749 --> 01:01:52,376
Morning.

827
01:01:54,754 --> 01:01:56,244
Did I dream it?

828
01:02:10,202 --> 01:02:11,999
Carrie?

829
01:02:12,938 --> 01:02:15,566
It's dinnertime. You slept the whole day.

830
01:02:16,708 --> 01:02:18,335
So?

831
01:02:31,357 --> 01:02:35,793
Honey? You have to eat a little breakfast.

832
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:38,989
I'm tired.

833
01:02:39,164 --> 01:02:42,599
Well, eat something,
then you can go back to sleep.

834
01:03:17,235 --> 01:03:19,568
- Oh, thank you, Paulo.
- Sure.

835
01:03:22,776 --> 01:03:27,643
With all this gorgeous fresh food, you're
gonna eat that pudding crap the entire trip?

836
01:03:27,814 --> 01:03:30,373
It's the only thing in the pantry
that's totally safe.

837
01:03:30,550 --> 01:03:34,315
See? "Made in Poughkeepsie. "
I didn't wanna chance it.

838
01:03:34,488 --> 01:03:36,251
It's a five-star resort.

839
01:03:36,622 --> 01:03:38,613
It's Mexico.

840
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:48,328
Carrie.

841
01:03:50,937 --> 01:03:52,028
Is there coffee?

842
01:03:53,105 --> 01:03:55,836
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

843
01:04:02,949 --> 01:04:05,348
The sun feels nice.

844
01:04:09,187 --> 01:04:11,315
Jesus, honey, wax much?

845
01:04:11,691 --> 01:04:14,660
What? I didn't know
I was gonna be wearing a bathing suit.

846
01:04:15,028 --> 01:04:17,791
- What are you talking about?
- I forgot to wax.

847
01:04:17,963 --> 01:04:21,729
- Since when, 1998?
I've had other things on my mind.

848
01:04:21,901 --> 01:04:24,496
I could be on death row
and not have that situation.

849
01:04:24,672 --> 01:04:27,764
Well, when you're married,
you have a different set of priorities.

850
01:04:27,940 --> 01:04:29,532
Oh, honey, don't blame marriage.

851
01:04:29,710 --> 01:04:32,576
This one's married and
she's not growing a national forest.

852
01:04:32,746 --> 01:04:36,646
How do you even cross your legs?
Let me make you a spa appointment.

853
01:04:36,816 --> 01:04:39,411
Any thicker,
and you won't be able to find it.

854
01:04:41,754 --> 01:04:43,721
So, what, it's my fault?

855
01:04:43,891 --> 01:04:47,018
I let the sex go out of my marriage.
I deserve what I got?

856
01:04:47,193 --> 01:04:50,891
- Thanks for understanding.
- Honey, I'm sorry. That's not what I...

857
01:04:51,065 --> 01:04:52,690
I'm fine.

858
01:05:04,011 --> 01:05:06,639
Hey, let's go down to the hotel
for dinner tonight.

859
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:08,577
- Really?
- Yeah.

860
01:05:08,748 --> 01:05:11,445
I gotta do something
to pull me out of my "Mexi-coma. "

861
01:05:11,617 --> 01:05:14,210
Oh, honey, you made a little joke.

862
01:05:14,387 --> 01:05:16,321
Good for you.

863
01:05:17,157 --> 01:05:18,316
Yeah.

864
01:05:34,675 --> 01:05:38,805
- My name is Felix, I'll be your server.
- Felix, we'll start with cuatro margaritas.

865
01:05:38,979 --> 01:05:41,209
Oh, no, I'm not drinking.
Just bottled water.

866
01:05:41,379 --> 01:05:43,610
- I'll drink hers.
- May I have your room numbers?

867
01:05:45,051 --> 01:05:48,987
We're staying in one of the private houses.
Uh, number 3.

868
01:05:49,590 --> 01:05:50,749
Very good, Mrs. Preston.

869
01:05:55,596 --> 01:05:57,257
That was like taking a bullet.

870
01:06:02,504 --> 01:06:05,267
Charlotte has pudding in her Prada.

871
01:06:11,613 --> 01:06:14,079
- Will I ever laugh again?
- Yes.

872
01:06:14,248 --> 01:06:17,944
- When?
- When something is really, really funny.

873
01:06:20,922 --> 01:06:24,720
Thank God for that mariachi band
or I'd be able to hear my own thoughts.

874
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:28,659
Fabulous. And keep them coming.

875
01:06:30,296 --> 01:06:31,661
Thanks.

876
01:06:37,403 --> 01:06:38,837
Thank you.

877
01:06:44,877 --> 01:06:47,607
He couldn't get out of the car.

878
01:06:48,082 --> 01:06:51,517
After 10 years
of what he already put me through...

879
01:06:51,685 --> 01:06:55,849
...he couldn't make the effort
and get out of the car.

880
01:06:56,157 --> 01:06:57,988
I made the effort.

881
01:06:58,157 --> 01:06:59,955
I put a bird on my head.

882
01:07:00,127 --> 01:07:01,650
- Is that what that was?
- Yeah.

883
01:07:01,829 --> 01:07:04,354
- I thought it was feathers.
- It was a bird.

884
01:07:04,531 --> 01:07:07,864
- It was beautiful.
Beautiful.

885
01:07:08,268 --> 01:07:10,394
He's a bad guy.

886
01:07:11,471 --> 01:07:13,664
Always was.

887
01:07:13,841 --> 01:07:17,743
- Bad guys do bad things.
- And good guys do bad things.

888
01:07:17,912 --> 01:07:20,846
The good guys screw you
and the bad guys screw you.

889
01:07:21,014 --> 01:07:23,073
The rest of them
don't know how to screw you.

890
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:26,377
- Trust me, I've done the legwork.
After everything I know...

891
01:07:26,553 --> 01:07:30,957
...after 20 years of
everything we've learned...

892
01:07:31,125 --> 01:07:35,025
...I threw it all away for the thrill of
putting his name on the honeymoon suite.

893
01:07:36,496 --> 01:07:38,760
If I met me now, I wouldn't know me.

894
01:07:40,234 --> 01:07:42,701
As long as we're going down this road...

895
01:07:42,871 --> 01:07:47,329
...I can't believe
that my life revolves around a man.

896
01:07:47,507 --> 01:07:49,839
On what planet
did I allow that to happen?

897
01:07:50,011 --> 01:07:51,070
But you love him.

898
01:07:51,246 --> 01:07:54,942
Does that mean saying his name
50 times more a day than I say my own?

899
01:07:55,682 --> 01:07:59,516
Does it mean worrying about him
and his needs before me and mine?

900
01:07:59,686 --> 01:08:02,052
Is it all about the other person?
Is that love?

901
01:08:02,222 --> 01:08:05,588
- No, that's marriage.
- Even this ring.

902
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:07,250
I wanted to buy this for myself.

903
01:08:07,428 --> 01:08:09,690
That meant something to me,
to be able to do that.

904
01:08:09,863 --> 01:08:13,458
- And then he buys it for me.
- Because he knew how much you loved it.

905
01:08:13,634 --> 01:08:17,570
Yes, but now every time I look down at it,
I see him not me.

906
01:08:19,908 --> 01:08:22,432
- Is every...?
- We'll take another round.

907
01:08:22,743 --> 01:08:25,769
- Another?
- Relax. We're on vacation.

908
01:08:25,948 --> 01:08:27,710
Technically, we're on my honeymoon.

909
01:08:27,881 --> 01:08:30,782
No, I think we're on their honeymoon.

910
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:34,720
Yeah, it's all so hot three days in.

911
01:08:42,263 --> 01:08:45,756
"Mailbox full. " Yeah, I'll bet it is.

912
01:08:45,933 --> 01:08:48,232
- There's no time like the present.
No.

913
01:08:49,136 --> 01:08:50,965
I'm not ready to face it all yet.

914
01:08:51,705 --> 01:08:54,936
Hey. I'm going for a run
and then to the gym for Pilates.

915
01:08:55,108 --> 01:08:57,133
Anybody wanna...?

916
01:08:58,412 --> 01:09:00,675
- Hi.
- Hey, good news.

917
01:09:00,846 --> 01:09:02,906
I got an e-mail
from your buyer's attorney.

918
01:09:03,084 --> 01:09:06,679
They're willing to sell you back
your old apartment at the escalated price...

919
01:09:06,854 --> 01:09:09,719
...and "are willing to vacate
by the time you return...

920
01:09:09,890 --> 01:09:11,917
...pending an additional financial offer. "

921
01:09:12,093 --> 01:09:15,757
Well, apparently you can go home again,
but it'll cost you.

922
01:09:15,931 --> 01:09:18,625
- Let's work on getting your things there.
Wow...

923
01:09:19,033 --> 01:09:21,696
...you two could rule the world.

924
01:09:22,403 --> 01:09:24,928
After her workout,
Charlotte couldn't help but think...

925
01:09:25,106 --> 01:09:27,004
...how truly blessed she was.

926
01:09:27,174 --> 01:09:30,906
This week had made her feel more grateful
than ever for her happy marriage.

927
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:35,378
And just for a second, while picturing
her loved ones at home in New York...

928
01:09:35,550 --> 01:09:39,750
...she forgot where she was
and opened her mouth.

929
01:10:02,142 --> 01:10:03,165
Hello, miss.

930
01:10:07,347 --> 01:10:09,543
- Have you had that happen?
Not recently.

931
01:10:09,717 --> 01:10:11,445
Sweetie, what's...?

932
01:10:11,618 --> 01:10:13,518
It's locked, she's mopping.

933
01:10:13,688 --> 01:10:15,280
Try the...

934
01:10:24,165 --> 01:10:26,565
- Did you just...?
- Shut up, shut up, shut up!

935
01:10:26,734 --> 01:10:28,724
And just like that...

936
01:10:28,903 --> 01:10:30,961
...Charlotte "Poughkeepsied"
in her pants.

937
01:10:33,174 --> 01:10:36,700
Oh, my God.

938
01:10:40,213 --> 01:10:41,545
Miranda was right.

939
01:10:41,717 --> 01:10:46,585
When something was really,
really funny, I laughed.

940
01:10:47,622 --> 01:10:49,556
Oh, my God.

941
01:11:14,349 --> 01:11:15,712
First message:

942
01:11:15,885 --> 01:11:20,980
Received Saturday,
September 20th, 12:30 p. m.

943
01:11:21,156 --> 01:11:24,590
Carrie, call me.
I need to talk to you before...

944
01:12:16,611 --> 01:12:20,479
There was no better time I could think of
to hire an assistant.

945
01:12:20,649 --> 01:12:24,106
Um, no. I do not lift boxes.

946
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:29,351
Yeah, definitely, no.
I would love a career in fashion.

947
01:12:29,524 --> 01:12:31,492
Oh.

948
01:12:32,527 --> 01:12:34,393
This is not nonfat.

949
01:12:34,730 --> 01:12:36,161
Oh.

950
01:12:36,330 --> 01:12:40,359
I love your books. Your shit's brilliant.

951
01:12:40,536 --> 01:12:42,127
Cathy?

952
01:12:43,138 --> 01:12:45,833
- You seem drunk.
- Little bit.

953
01:12:46,007 --> 01:12:47,839
Never made it to bed last night.

954
01:12:48,011 --> 01:12:50,374
But I type like a motherfucker!

955
01:12:50,546 --> 01:12:52,536
I have a degree in finance
from Princeton...

956
01:12:52,714 --> 01:12:55,376
...and I've been assistant to a V.P.
At Merrill Lynch.

957
01:12:55,551 --> 01:13:00,681
That's impressive. And, Paul,
why do you think you're right for this job?

958
01:13:08,497 --> 01:13:13,161
- So you're from St. Louis?
- That's right. Louise from St. Louis.

959
01:13:13,335 --> 01:13:15,235
And you have a degree
in computer science?

960
01:13:15,405 --> 01:13:18,395
- Yes, that's correct.
- Well, good for you. I can barely text.

961
01:13:20,442 --> 01:13:24,139
- Have you ever been a personal assistant?
- No, but I'm the oldest of six kids...

962
01:13:24,313 --> 01:13:26,506
...so I'm sure I can handle
anything you got.

963
01:13:26,683 --> 01:13:29,515
- Wow. Six kids, what's that like?
- Crowded.

964
01:13:29,952 --> 01:13:33,080
I had to move to New York just to
get some room. Where did I end up?

965
01:13:33,257 --> 01:13:35,883
In a one-bedroom apartment
with three roommates.

966
01:13:36,391 --> 01:13:39,553
Well, aside from the space issue,
why'd you move to New York?

967
01:13:41,496 --> 01:13:42,758
To fall in love.

968
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:47,665
- What? That's corny, right?
- No.

969
01:13:47,836 --> 01:13:51,795
No, no, it's... It's just very honest.

970
01:13:52,841 --> 01:13:57,038
I don't think that I've heard
anybody say that in a very long time.

971
01:13:57,578 --> 01:13:58,910
Well...

972
01:14:00,850 --> 01:14:04,182
So Louise from St. Louis,
I just have one more question.

973
01:14:04,354 --> 01:14:05,378
Okay.

974
01:14:05,588 --> 01:14:07,920
How does an unemployed girl
with three roommates...

975
01:14:08,091 --> 01:14:10,615
...afford the Patchwork Denim Bowley
Louis Vuitton bag?

976
01:14:10,994 --> 01:14:15,396
It's rented. Bag Borrow or Steal?
It's like Netflix for purses.

977
01:14:15,564 --> 01:14:19,330
- How can I not know about this?
- Girl, stick with me. I'll hook you up.

978
01:14:24,339 --> 01:14:27,399
And did she hook me up.

979
01:14:27,944 --> 01:14:31,937
Hi. This is Louise.
I'm calling for Carrie Bradshaw.

980
01:14:32,582 --> 01:14:36,643
Yes, she received your invitation,
but she will be unable to attend.

981
01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:38,447
Thank you.

982
01:14:42,524 --> 01:14:44,582
Put that over there.

983
01:14:45,695 --> 01:14:47,560
After only three days...

984
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:52,358
...I began to think of her
as Saint Louise from St. Louis.

985
01:14:53,103 --> 01:14:55,295
Ain't nothing in there for you.

986
01:14:56,205 --> 01:14:59,299
And as I moved back
into my old apartment...

987
01:14:59,475 --> 01:15:02,443
...Miranda searched for a new one,
downtown.

988
01:15:02,611 --> 01:15:05,581
You see the Chinese writing?
Yeah.

989
01:15:05,749 --> 01:15:08,979
New York magazine says this is
the new up-and-coming neighborhood.

990
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:12,944
- Okay, maybe down that way?
- Maybe you come home.

991
01:15:14,424 --> 01:15:17,051
Look, white guy with a baby.

992
01:15:17,427 --> 01:15:20,883
Wherever he's going,
that's where we need to be.

993
01:15:21,663 --> 01:15:23,154
Come on.

994
01:15:28,571 --> 01:15:33,200
I lived here before.
This used to be all-Ukrainian area.

995
01:15:33,410 --> 01:15:35,104
A U-Haul.

996
01:15:35,845 --> 01:15:37,242
Coming or going?

997
01:15:37,913 --> 01:15:40,973
- Going. Oh, boy. I'm gonna check it out.
- Okay.

998
01:15:41,151 --> 01:15:42,139
Wait down here, okay?

999
01:15:43,786 --> 01:15:44,980
Okay.

1000
01:15:45,154 --> 01:15:47,520
Hi. Do you have an apartment?
Stay, stay, stay.

1001
01:16:01,838 --> 01:16:06,034
And there in old Ukrainia,
Miranda found her new apartment.

1002
01:16:06,208 --> 01:16:08,974
- Hi. I'm interested in the apartment upstairs.
Yeah.

1003
01:16:10,780 --> 01:16:13,247
"And there they remained
for the rest of their days...

1004
01:16:13,415 --> 01:16:15,406
...for the birds
were constantly on guard...

1005
01:16:15,584 --> 01:16:19,020
...and the women could not so much
as step one foot out the door.

1006
01:16:19,188 --> 01:16:23,716
And Cinderella and the prince
lived happily ever after. "

1007
01:16:30,267 --> 01:16:33,758
You know that this is just a fairy tale,
right, sweetheart?

1008
01:16:33,937 --> 01:16:37,269
I mean, things don't always
happen like this in real life.

1009
01:16:37,940 --> 01:16:42,239
- I just think you should know that now.
- Again.

1010
01:16:43,414 --> 01:16:45,245
And another one bites the dust.

1011
01:16:45,416 --> 01:16:47,405
- Hi.
Hi.

1012
01:16:47,884 --> 01:16:49,850
Mommy's home.

1013
01:16:50,452 --> 01:16:52,852
Thanks for watching Lily
while I went to the doctor.

1014
01:16:53,021 --> 01:16:57,118
- Oh, sure. Everything okay?
- Mm-hm.

1015
01:16:57,828 --> 01:17:01,730
- I'm pregnant.
- How?

1016
01:17:01,898 --> 01:17:06,562
You know how people always say
that when you stop trying, it can happen?

1017
01:17:06,737 --> 01:17:10,069
And my doctor says that she knows
other couples who have adopted...

1018
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:12,401
...and then they get pregnant.

1019
01:17:13,043 --> 01:17:16,342
- Sweetie.
- Carrie, I'm pregnant.

1020
01:17:18,148 --> 01:17:21,082
I guess in certain houses,
fairy tales do come true.

1021
01:17:24,434 --> 01:17:26,628
Oh, that was really hot.

1022
01:17:28,005 --> 01:17:32,407
- You seem kind of distant.
- Distant? You're still in me.

1023
01:17:39,650 --> 01:17:44,176
- Do you wanna talk about it?
- When have I ever wanted to talk about it?

1024
01:17:44,353 --> 01:17:47,790
Okay. I'll talk about it.

1025
01:17:47,958 --> 01:17:50,255
Your best friends got screwed over
by their guys.

1026
01:17:50,426 --> 01:17:52,859
How could you not be distant?

1027
01:17:54,664 --> 01:17:56,860
It's more than that.

1028
01:17:58,003 --> 01:18:02,802
Lately, I haven't been feeling
a connection to...

1029
01:18:03,308 --> 01:18:05,104
- What, me?
- No.

1030
01:18:05,642 --> 01:18:11,045
To it, here. I have no real connection
to our life here.

1031
01:18:11,214 --> 01:18:13,911
What life here? Seriously.

1032
01:18:14,084 --> 01:18:15,380
All I do is work...

1033
01:18:15,552 --> 01:18:17,951
...and you run off to New York
every chance you get.

1034
01:18:18,122 --> 01:18:22,387
Well, not every chance I get.
Only for the A-list things.

1035
01:18:22,559 --> 01:18:25,652
And my managing you, it's...
It's getting to be too much.

1036
01:18:25,829 --> 01:18:27,557
I'm starting to resent it.

1037
01:18:27,730 --> 01:18:30,325
For the last two years,
it's been all about you.

1038
01:18:30,502 --> 01:18:33,630
Well, for the first three years,
it was all about you.

1039
01:18:33,805 --> 01:18:36,932
I know. That was so much more fun.

1040
01:18:39,311 --> 01:18:42,473
Well, I won't be coming to New York
for a while.

1041
01:18:42,647 --> 01:18:46,046
We're gonna spend some time
reconnecting on weekends...

1042
01:18:46,215 --> 01:18:48,080
...do the L.A. -couple thing.

1043
01:18:48,252 --> 01:18:50,413
Yeah, hi. Can you put on Samantha?

1044
01:18:51,021 --> 01:18:55,014
Really. At first I was all,
"You can't tell me what I can do. "

1045
01:18:55,192 --> 01:18:57,160
But then I had to admit, he had a point.

1046
01:18:57,394 --> 01:18:59,725
Please deposit another 85 cents.

1047
01:18:59,897 --> 01:19:01,762
Honey, a payphone? Where's your cell?

1048
01:19:01,932 --> 01:19:04,263
At the bottom of the ocean in Mexico.

1049
01:19:04,435 --> 01:19:08,030
- Want me to hook you up with a new one?
- No, not yet. No phone, no calls.

1050
01:19:08,206 --> 01:19:12,300
No calls, no questions.
No questions, no explaining no wedding.

1051
01:19:12,476 --> 01:19:14,875
Plus, it's an excuse
to bust out the gloves.

1052
01:19:15,143 --> 01:19:17,204
Please deposit another 85...

1053
01:19:17,981 --> 01:19:20,882
Carrie Bradshaw's web page is a mess.

1054
01:19:21,051 --> 01:19:23,177
Interesting. So is Carrie Bradshaw.

1055
01:19:24,388 --> 01:19:28,949
Hey, when are we gonna get to the really
important stuff, like unpacking my closet?

1056
01:19:29,126 --> 01:19:32,061
One thing at a time. You ever gonna
answer any of these e-mails?

1057
01:19:32,228 --> 01:19:33,787
- Yes.
- When?

1058
01:19:34,999 --> 01:19:36,761
- Now?
- Okay.

1059
01:19:36,935 --> 01:19:40,461
- Well, I'll read and you tell me what to do.
- Okay.

1060
01:19:40,838 --> 01:19:45,206
Who's john@jjpny. com?

1061
01:19:46,177 --> 01:19:49,704
Oh, shit. That's him, right?

1062
01:20:02,127 --> 01:20:03,149
Delete.

1063
01:20:05,628 --> 01:20:08,960
And isn't there some cyberspace place
that you can send those...

1064
01:20:09,133 --> 01:20:12,534
...so that I never have to see
an e-mail from him ever again?

1065
01:20:13,505 --> 01:20:15,232
Do that, please.

1066
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:19,933
You sure you wanna end
all communication with him?

1067
01:20:20,111 --> 01:20:21,579
Mm-hm.

1068
01:20:25,683 --> 01:20:28,048
Okay. Great.

1069
01:20:30,588 --> 01:20:32,452
I can't believe you're even dressing up.

1070
01:20:32,623 --> 01:20:36,114
All the parents in Brady's school
dress up. It's fun.

1071
01:20:36,292 --> 01:20:40,457
Fun thought up by a group of non-working
mothers with nothing else to do all day.

1072
01:20:40,632 --> 01:20:45,624
All right, what do they got?
Witch and sexy kitten.

1073
01:20:45,803 --> 01:20:50,138
That's it. The only two choices
for women, witch and sexy kitten.

1074
01:20:50,308 --> 01:20:52,400
You just said a mouthful there, sister.

1075
01:20:52,577 --> 01:20:56,776
Maybe I should wear this and
a briefcase, and go as myself.

1076
01:20:57,749 --> 01:20:59,977
I got an e-mail from Big.

1077
01:21:00,585 --> 01:21:02,313
"I don't know what to say. "

1078
01:21:02,488 --> 01:21:07,425
- Uh, then don't send an e-mail.
- What were you expecting?

1079
01:21:08,192 --> 01:21:11,559
And in the subject box, two words:

1080
01:21:11,728 --> 01:21:14,993
- "I'm sorry. "
- Ugh.

1081
01:21:15,365 --> 01:21:17,493
Steve is all about the "I'm sorry. "

1082
01:21:17,669 --> 01:21:20,398
"I'm sorry" e-mails,
"I'm sorry" voice mails...

1083
01:21:20,572 --> 01:21:23,096
..."I'm sorry" flowers, "I'm sorry" cards.

1084
01:21:23,274 --> 01:21:27,210
How about, don't do anything
to be "I'm sorry" for?

1085
01:21:27,378 --> 01:21:29,743
Well, maybe he's sorry.

1086
01:21:29,913 --> 01:21:32,245
Well, maybe so is Big.

1087
01:21:32,584 --> 01:21:33,811
Point taken.

1088
01:21:36,221 --> 01:21:37,709
Hey, you're scaring the women.

1089
01:21:37,889 --> 01:21:41,688
It's gonna take a little more than that
to scare me after what I've been through.

1090
01:21:42,260 --> 01:21:46,856
I still cannot believe this happened to me.
I mean, I... I know it happened.

1091
01:21:47,031 --> 01:21:52,162
But I just... I can't believe it happened.

1092
01:21:53,505 --> 01:21:59,374
I lay awake at night going over
every detail of that last week in my head.

1093
01:22:00,179 --> 01:22:05,615
Carrie, there's a detail about that last week
I've been meaning to tell you.

1094
01:22:05,782 --> 01:22:08,876
- At the rehearsal dinner...
- And then I saw it.

1095
01:22:09,052 --> 01:22:13,352
The only thing scary enough to scare me
after what I'd been through.

1096
01:22:13,524 --> 01:22:16,425
You look great.
You look amazing. So that's the worst of it.

1097
01:22:16,595 --> 01:22:17,787
Wait, wait, wait.

1098
01:22:19,164 --> 01:22:21,221
What does it say there
in the editor's note?

1099
01:22:21,399 --> 01:22:24,629
"The wedding of Carrie Bradshaw
and John James Preston was canceled...

1100
01:22:24,801 --> 01:22:27,997
...as this issue went to press.
Bradshaw is... "

1101
01:22:30,241 --> 01:22:32,435
Bradshaw is what?

1102
01:22:33,877 --> 01:22:34,901
Wait...

1103
01:22:37,148 --> 01:22:41,140
"Bradshaw is still single
and living in New York City. "

1104
01:22:48,593 --> 01:22:50,788
I didn't wanna buy it...

1105
01:22:50,962 --> 01:22:53,556
...but I figured it was
one less Vogue in New York.

1106
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:56,334
I saw it. The pictures are gorgeous.

1107
01:22:56,502 --> 01:22:58,058
Yeah, I'm a beautiful bride.

1108
01:22:58,536 --> 01:23:00,798
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

1109
01:23:00,972 --> 01:23:04,202
Hey, hey, hey, come on in.
- Come on, sweetie.

1110
01:23:04,375 --> 01:23:06,171
Get your hat.

1111
01:23:07,312 --> 01:23:09,472
- Look, the people who don't know...
- Yeah.

1112
01:23:09,646 --> 01:23:12,708
...will only see the beautiful pictures.
The people who do know...

1113
01:23:12,885 --> 01:23:14,908
...will only see what an asshole he is.

1114
01:23:16,254 --> 01:23:17,619
Mommy said a bad word.

1115
01:23:20,758 --> 01:23:23,852
Oh. Is that for me?

1116
01:23:24,028 --> 01:23:26,861
Oh, Lily, thank you.

1117
01:23:27,031 --> 01:23:29,225
Hey, what are you gonna be
for Halloween?

1118
01:23:29,399 --> 01:23:30,458
Cinderella.

1119
01:23:31,537 --> 01:23:35,870
- Or we also bought Mulan.
- No.

1120
01:23:36,342 --> 01:23:39,333
We came to ask you if you would
go trick-or-treating with us.

1121
01:23:39,510 --> 01:23:42,207
- Yeah!
It's just in our building...

1122
01:23:42,381 --> 01:23:44,814
...if you're in the mood.
- Yeah!

1123
01:23:45,883 --> 01:23:47,782
Yeah!

1124
01:23:57,997 --> 01:23:59,931
- No costume?
No, look closer.

1125
01:24:00,098 --> 01:24:04,466
I'm the scariest thing in New York,
jilted at 41. Boo!

1126
01:24:07,906 --> 01:24:10,066
You know you have to
give me some of your loot?

1127
01:24:10,242 --> 01:24:12,903
- Yeah.
- Aw.

1128
01:24:13,712 --> 01:24:16,374
Let's put your mask on.

1129
01:24:16,547 --> 01:24:18,981
- Look...
- Trick or treat!

1130
01:24:19,151 --> 01:24:21,515
Oh! Carrie.

1131
01:24:21,687 --> 01:24:23,450
I saw you in Vogue.

1132
01:24:23,622 --> 01:24:25,612
I'm so sorry.

1133
01:24:27,291 --> 01:24:28,349
There you go, honey.

1134
01:24:30,796 --> 01:24:32,955
Trick or treat!

1135
01:24:57,423 --> 01:24:58,821
Louise.

1136
01:25:01,226 --> 01:25:04,388
Oh, my Lord. I didn't even recognize you.

1137
01:25:04,563 --> 01:25:07,428
That's the point. My head's
in the Witness Protection Program.

1138
01:25:07,597 --> 01:25:09,658
I'm feeling that look on you though.

1139
01:25:09,836 --> 01:25:14,465
- And I am feeling that Chanel on you.
- Mine till Tuesday.

1140
01:25:16,641 --> 01:25:20,042
- All right, so...
- Here. Time to rejoin the world.

1141
01:25:20,213 --> 01:25:22,042
Already?

1142
01:25:23,882 --> 01:25:29,343
- Your new number, area code 347-85...
- Ho... Ho... Hold it.

1143
01:25:29,621 --> 01:25:31,280
347?

1144
01:25:31,456 --> 01:25:35,187
Oh, no. No, I'm a 917 gal,
always have been.

1145
01:25:35,494 --> 01:25:38,362
I tried. It's no longer available.

1146
01:25:38,531 --> 01:25:39,963
Now you're 347.

1147
01:25:40,432 --> 01:25:41,660
Samantha Jones.

1148
01:25:41,834 --> 01:25:45,098
Carrie Bradshaw. Or I used to be.

1149
01:25:45,269 --> 01:25:46,499
Talk to me.

1150
01:25:47,105 --> 01:25:50,872
I'm a 347 area code. How awful is that?

1151
01:25:51,043 --> 01:25:53,011
347 is the new New York.

1152
01:25:53,178 --> 01:25:57,239
Well, I want the old New York
with my old 917 and my old will to live.

1153
01:25:57,417 --> 01:26:01,183
Old New York, new New York.
Honey, at least it's New York.

1154
01:26:01,886 --> 01:26:04,515
Another hard thing about being in L. A:

1155
01:26:04,823 --> 01:26:06,882
My sex-on-a-stick next-door neighbor.

1156
01:26:07,060 --> 01:26:09,585
- I can't stop looking at him.
- Looking?

1157
01:26:09,762 --> 01:26:14,927
Just looking. After seeing Steve's face
at the rehearsal dinner, I could never...

1158
01:26:15,934 --> 01:26:18,959
Oh, but you should see this guy.
Every night...

1159
01:26:19,138 --> 01:26:21,765
...sex with a different partner. He's like...

1160
01:26:22,675 --> 01:26:27,110
...me five years ago.
- Yeah. When I was a 917.

1161
01:26:27,279 --> 01:26:30,372
I mean, what's the point
of having a hot guy next door...

1162
01:26:30,548 --> 01:26:33,143
...if you can't have sex with him?

1163
01:26:33,319 --> 01:26:37,118
We agreed that no one else from the show
but Smith was going to be on the cover.

1164
01:26:38,390 --> 01:26:40,449
Well, get back to me.

1165
01:26:46,064 --> 01:26:47,121
Hey.

1166
01:27:15,395 --> 01:27:18,831
And in an effort to stay out of the house
and out of trouble...

1167
01:27:18,998 --> 01:27:21,521
...Samantha went shopping.

1168
01:27:24,604 --> 01:27:26,003
Rescue a puppy today?

1169
01:27:34,012 --> 01:27:38,574
- She needs a good home. Interested?
- No.

1170
01:27:38,751 --> 01:27:42,653
And just as Samantha convinced herself
that the dog wasn't for her...

1171
01:27:46,492 --> 01:27:49,552
She's been fixed,
but she hasn't lost the urge.

1172
01:27:58,238 --> 01:28:01,695
And because Samantha
couldn't get off...

1173
01:28:03,110 --> 01:28:04,507
...she got things.

1174
01:28:16,855 --> 01:28:20,051
What would happen if these
were to magically disappear?

1175
01:28:20,226 --> 01:28:24,218
- Yeah, I know where you live.
- For a pair like this, I could move.

1176
01:28:24,763 --> 01:28:27,425
Wait, Carrie, not that one.

1177
01:28:33,267 --> 01:28:34,961
Do you want me to get rid of it?

1178
01:28:36,937 --> 01:28:38,563
No.

1179
01:28:39,438 --> 01:28:41,267
No, it's too beautiful.

1180
01:28:43,109 --> 01:28:44,632
I'll just...

1181
01:28:44,843 --> 01:28:47,711
...bury it deep in the back...

1182
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:50,007
...like I did my feelings.

1183
01:28:51,218 --> 01:28:54,674
- Do you miss him?
- Every day.

1184
01:28:56,022 --> 01:28:58,047
It's weird...

1185
01:28:58,990 --> 01:29:01,516
...I haven't cried very much at all.

1186
01:29:01,794 --> 01:29:03,659
I don't know, maybe...

1187
01:29:04,397 --> 01:29:08,094
Maybe you're only allotted
a certain amount of tears per man...

1188
01:29:08,267 --> 01:29:10,166
...and I used mine up.

1189
01:29:10,336 --> 01:29:12,668
Yeah, I know how you feel.

1190
01:29:12,839 --> 01:29:16,332
Because my St. Louis boyfriend
broke up with me last year...

1191
01:29:16,642 --> 01:29:18,439
...and I miss him all the time.

1192
01:29:18,846 --> 01:29:23,681
Suddenly, it dawned on me. There
were two broken hearts in my walk-in.

1193
01:29:26,953 --> 01:29:30,514
Louise, we need a cocktail.
Grab your rental.

1194
01:29:31,358 --> 01:29:34,020
And it threw me so hard.

1195
01:29:34,429 --> 01:29:37,191
Because, you know, I thought Will...

1196
01:29:37,363 --> 01:29:39,057
That's his name.

1197
01:29:39,499 --> 01:29:43,799
- I thought he was the love of my life.
- Well, what happened?

1198
01:29:44,770 --> 01:29:48,228
He said he loved me and all,
but he didn't think that I was the one.

1199
01:29:49,708 --> 01:29:54,545
That shit hurt. But, you know, whatever.

1200
01:29:54,715 --> 01:29:57,683
- I'm not gonna give up on love.
- Good.

1201
01:29:57,850 --> 01:30:00,182
Love is the thing, you know.

1202
01:30:02,989 --> 01:30:04,013
You see that?

1203
01:30:04,191 --> 01:30:09,060
That's love.
And I'm bringing it to me all day long.

1204
01:30:10,998 --> 01:30:12,589
Excuse me.

1205
01:30:17,537 --> 01:30:21,233
Oh, I remember that smile.
Who's the guy?

1206
01:30:21,407 --> 01:30:24,569
Someone I just met.
He wants me to meet him for drinks.

1207
01:30:24,744 --> 01:30:27,770
At 11:30? Oh, that's a booty call.

1208
01:30:27,948 --> 01:30:31,508
No, it's not.
He's a waiter, he just got off work.

1209
01:30:31,684 --> 01:30:35,916
Louise. Now, I may not get texts,
I may not send texts, but trust me.

1210
01:30:36,090 --> 01:30:39,285
The subtext of that text? Booty.

1211
01:30:40,527 --> 01:30:43,519
But if he meets me,
then it's not a booty call, right?

1212
01:30:45,697 --> 01:30:49,361
All right, then. Enjoy yourself.

1213
01:30:49,536 --> 01:30:51,263
That's what your 20s are for.

1214
01:30:51,939 --> 01:30:54,237
Your 30s are to learn the lessons.

1215
01:30:54,408 --> 01:30:57,001
Your 40s are to pay for the drinks.

1216
01:30:57,577 --> 01:31:01,307
Well, in that case, I'll take another one.

1217
01:31:03,083 --> 01:31:05,075
It's all about the desk.

1218
01:31:05,252 --> 01:31:08,277
If I find the desk, the writing will come.
And it better come...

1219
01:31:08,455 --> 01:31:12,516
...because I'm using my new book advance
to pay the fancy decorator.

1220
01:31:13,828 --> 01:31:18,626
I think it is so great that you're
redoing your entire apartment.

1221
01:31:18,798 --> 01:31:21,232
Yeah, well, out with the old and...

1222
01:31:21,401 --> 01:31:24,960
...oh, in with the overpriced.

1223
01:31:28,009 --> 01:31:32,809
Hey. Harry called me and
mentioned that you're not running.

1224
01:31:33,013 --> 01:31:37,383
- Why'd he do that?
- Because he loves you and he's concerned.

1225
01:31:37,550 --> 01:31:39,678
There's nothing to be concerned about.

1226
01:31:39,854 --> 01:31:44,585
Well, did...? Did the doctor say
that it's not safe or something?

1227
01:31:45,458 --> 01:31:48,519
No. She said because
I'm already a runner, it's fine.

1228
01:31:49,629 --> 01:31:51,255
So then, why are you not...?

1229
01:31:51,430 --> 01:31:53,694
Because I'm afraid
something bad is gonna happen.

1230
01:31:53,867 --> 01:31:57,702
- It's a miracle I'm even pregnant.
- Okay.

1231
01:31:58,839 --> 01:32:01,636
I have everything I ever wanted.

1232
01:32:01,808 --> 01:32:04,174
I am so happy that I'm terrified.

1233
01:32:04,711 --> 01:32:09,670
Nobody gets everything that they want.
Look at you. Look at Miranda.

1234
01:32:10,450 --> 01:32:12,849
You're good people
and look at what happened to you.

1235
01:32:13,018 --> 01:32:15,318
Of course something bad
is gonna happen to me.

1236
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:17,046
Sweetie...

1237
01:32:17,225 --> 01:32:19,920
...you shit your pants this year.

1238
01:32:20,093 --> 01:32:21,218
Maybe you're done.

1239
01:32:25,868 --> 01:32:28,529
You run every day, that's what you do.

1240
01:32:28,704 --> 01:32:32,569
You can't stop being who you are
because you're afraid, right?

1241
01:32:34,408 --> 01:32:35,705
All right.

1242
01:32:36,109 --> 01:32:39,476
Okay. Here we go.

1243
01:32:41,314 --> 01:32:42,975
Okay.

1244
01:32:47,319 --> 01:32:50,448
And as the last
of the autumn leaves fell away...

1245
01:32:50,623 --> 01:32:53,059
...so did Charlotte's fear.

1246
01:32:55,196 --> 01:33:00,462
By the time the first snow fell,
Charlotte got her stride back.

1247
01:33:07,841 --> 01:33:11,505
Are you sure you don't want me
to R.S.V.P. To any of these holiday parties?

1248
01:33:11,679 --> 01:33:14,305
No, I am perfectly happy
spending time alone.

1249
01:33:14,481 --> 01:33:16,813
You sure?
Because this looks like a good one.

1250
01:33:16,983 --> 01:33:20,247
Go home. Seriously,
you're gonna miss your plane, go.

1251
01:33:20,655 --> 01:33:24,489
Okay. But first...

1252
01:33:27,463 --> 01:33:29,693
Merry Christmas.

1253
01:33:31,799 --> 01:33:35,359
- You didn't have to.
- It's just something silly.

1254
01:33:37,738 --> 01:33:39,171
Oh.

1255
01:33:39,706 --> 01:33:43,197
- Oh, Louise from St. Louis.
- You said you never saw it.

1256
01:33:43,376 --> 01:33:45,777
Well, jeez.

1257
01:33:45,946 --> 01:33:47,881
Now I feel bad.

1258
01:33:48,049 --> 01:33:51,575
If I had known
we were exchanging gifts...

1259
01:33:55,356 --> 01:33:58,188
...I would have bought you one
two weeks ago...

1260
01:33:58,359 --> 01:34:00,918
...and hidden it here.

1261
01:34:04,399 --> 01:34:09,027
- That is not what I think it is.
- I don't know, open it.

1262
01:34:21,983 --> 01:34:23,848
Oh, my God.

1263
01:34:24,118 --> 01:34:26,245
My very own Louis Vuitton?

1264
01:34:26,422 --> 01:34:29,252
That's right. No more rental for you.

1265
01:34:29,791 --> 01:34:32,691
Look who's home from the big city.

1266
01:34:34,328 --> 01:34:37,319
It was the best money I'd ever spent.

1267
01:34:38,199 --> 01:34:41,327
New Year's Eve and a cup of noodles.

1268
01:34:50,779 --> 01:34:53,213
So you remember
what you're gonna say at midnight?

1269
01:34:53,382 --> 01:34:56,543
- Happy New Year.
- Yeah.

1270
01:34:56,717 --> 01:34:59,515
Except you're gonna say it
much more excited than that.

1271
01:34:59,687 --> 01:35:04,988
- You're gonna say, "Happy New Year!"
- Happy New Year.

1272
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:09,721
Yeah. And you say that
and then you kiss.

1273
01:35:17,572 --> 01:35:19,096
All right.

1274
01:35:19,774 --> 01:35:21,765
- All ready to go, B-boy?
- Yeah.

1275
01:35:21,943 --> 01:35:24,934
Did you remember to pack
the Batman that Santa brought you?

1276
01:35:25,113 --> 01:35:26,477
I think it's in the kitchen.

1277
01:35:26,648 --> 01:35:28,739
Oh, you gotta have the new Batman, huh?

1278
01:35:36,625 --> 01:35:38,820
You got plans with the girls?

1279
01:35:38,993 --> 01:35:40,290
Um...

1280
01:35:40,462 --> 01:35:43,328
We're all kind of staying in tonight.

1281
01:35:45,199 --> 01:35:48,191
Would you like to
come out and eat with us?

1282
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:52,769
We could go someplace
on your side of the bridge.

1283
01:35:52,941 --> 01:35:55,773
No. Thank you.

1284
01:35:59,915 --> 01:36:02,748
Miranda, I never meant to hurt you.

1285
01:36:07,121 --> 01:36:09,112
I found him.

1286
01:36:09,956 --> 01:36:13,290
- Batman.
- Oh, there he is. Batman.

1287
01:36:13,460 --> 01:36:15,087
- Okay.
- Okay.

1288
01:36:15,263 --> 01:36:16,924
- Put your hat on.
- Yeah.

1289
01:36:17,097 --> 01:36:20,125
- It's snowing out.
- Here you go.

1290
01:36:20,303 --> 01:36:23,031
I'm gonna bring Batman.
Okay.

1291
01:36:23,205 --> 01:36:24,934
Happy New Year.

1292
01:36:25,774 --> 01:36:27,035
Happy New Year.

1293
01:36:28,242 --> 01:36:29,402
Kiss.

1294
01:36:40,322 --> 01:36:42,619
All right, I'll see you tomorrow.

1295
01:36:45,595 --> 01:36:47,494
This is my new...

1296
01:36:50,298 --> 01:36:52,095
You know what we're gonna do?

1297
01:36:52,267 --> 01:36:55,462
We're gonna light a firecracker
at midnight.

1298
01:37:46,922 --> 01:37:49,686
- Hello?
Happy New Year.

1299
01:37:49,857 --> 01:37:51,520
We're having a fabulous time.

1300
01:37:51,693 --> 01:37:54,218
The only thing missing is you. Come.

1301
01:37:54,396 --> 01:37:57,832
That's sweet but I can't.
I'm... I'm writing.

1302
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,967
Oh, okay.

1303
01:38:00,536 --> 01:38:02,162
You're not really writing, are you?

1304
01:38:03,739 --> 01:38:07,038
No. You're not really
having a fabulous time, are you?

1305
01:38:07,209 --> 01:38:08,870
No. Rescue me.

1306
01:38:10,546 --> 01:38:11,977
There's no one fun here.

1307
01:38:12,147 --> 01:38:13,910
It's very forced-festive.

1308
01:38:14,082 --> 01:38:17,313
Oh, yes. That's just what
every New Year's Eve party needs...

1309
01:38:17,486 --> 01:38:19,647
...a visit from the lost Brontë sister.

1310
01:38:20,989 --> 01:38:23,149
Well, better a Brontë sister
than a Hilton sister.

1311
01:38:23,326 --> 01:38:25,349
Thanks, but...

1312
01:38:25,526 --> 01:38:30,122
...by 10 p. m. I will be in bed asleep...

1313
01:38:31,098 --> 01:38:37,059
...and blissfully unaware of
how fabulous this night is supposed to be.

1314
01:38:58,127 --> 01:39:00,059
- Hello?
So I thought...

1315
01:39:00,227 --> 01:39:02,321
...that one of the perks
of having a family...

1316
01:39:02,498 --> 01:39:06,228
...was that you didn't have to spend
New Year's Eve alone with Chinese food.

1317
01:39:06,402 --> 01:39:08,890
I am alone with Chinese food.

1318
01:39:09,738 --> 01:39:13,435
- I was asleep.
- Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

1319
01:39:13,610 --> 01:39:17,339
No, no, that's okay. Where's Brady?

1320
01:39:17,513 --> 01:39:21,210
- It's Steve's night.
- Oh. Right.

1321
01:39:21,384 --> 01:39:26,150
- Don't wake up. Go... Go back to sleep.
- No, it's okay.

1322
01:39:26,322 --> 01:39:28,789
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

1323
01:39:28,956 --> 01:39:31,016
I got all choked up...

1324
01:39:31,194 --> 01:39:34,719
...watching stupid New Year's Eve stuff
alone on TV.

1325
01:39:34,897 --> 01:39:38,730
- You want me to come over?
- I'm all the way downtown.

1326
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:41,563
No, I can... You know, I can...
I grab a cab.

1327
01:39:42,573 --> 01:39:46,337
On New Year's? No way.
I'm... I'm... I'm fine.

1328
01:39:46,510 --> 01:39:48,910
Really. I just...
I just wanted to talk a little.

1329
01:39:49,079 --> 01:39:52,672
Go back to sleep. I'll...
I'll see you next year.

1330
01:39:53,148 --> 01:39:55,548
- Good night.
- Good night.

1331
01:40:33,556 --> 01:40:35,047
Good one.

1332
01:40:41,130 --> 01:40:43,724
- It's almost time.
- Champagne?

1333
01:40:54,009 --> 01:40:56,909
Oh, my God. Thank God you're here.

1334
01:42:30,206 --> 01:42:32,800
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

1335
01:42:33,176 --> 01:42:35,111
You're not alone.

1336
01:42:39,315 --> 01:42:42,216
Happy New Year.

1337
01:43:27,097 --> 01:43:29,257
- A young child that perhaps they've...
- Oh!

1338
01:43:29,433 --> 01:43:31,297
- Hey, easy there, girl.
- You all right?

1339
01:43:31,466 --> 01:43:32,492
Yeah. Thanks.

1340
01:43:32,670 --> 01:43:35,866
Three months driving in L.A.
And I forgot how to use my fucking legs.

1341
01:43:36,040 --> 01:43:37,803
Every spring, the women of New York...

1342
01:43:37,975 --> 01:43:42,376
...leave the foolish choices of their past
behind and look forward to the future.

1343
01:43:42,545 --> 01:43:44,740
This is known as Fashion Week.

1344
01:43:44,982 --> 01:43:46,949
Excuse me. Hi.

1345
01:43:47,917 --> 01:43:49,543
Oh, there we are.

1346
01:43:50,153 --> 01:43:54,089
- We're in the front row?
- I had to pull some strings.

1347
01:43:54,624 --> 01:43:56,682
- Very nice.
- I should go thank them.

1348
01:43:56,860 --> 01:44:00,852
Decide where we're gonna go for lunch
and I'll make a call. It's just like old times.

1349
01:44:01,466 --> 01:44:03,955
So this is what you all
spent your Saturdays doing...

1350
01:44:04,135 --> 01:44:06,932
...while I was with Brady and Steve
at the Brooklyn Aquarium?

1351
01:44:07,604 --> 01:44:09,433
Well...

1352
01:44:09,706 --> 01:44:11,901
...not every Saturday.

1353
01:44:12,075 --> 01:44:16,274
Just so you know, we always had
front row at the mammal show.

1354
01:44:17,380 --> 01:44:19,506
Steve does the funniest
dolphin impression.

1355
01:44:19,683 --> 01:44:23,550
Actually, it's more Steve as a dolphin.

1356
01:44:28,925 --> 01:44:30,722
You really can't forgive him?

1357
01:44:32,029 --> 01:44:33,620
Are you suggesting something?

1358
01:44:34,598 --> 01:44:37,464
I like Steve. I always liked Steve.

1359
01:44:37,634 --> 01:44:41,264
He's apologized 100 times.
He's not seeing anyone else.

1360
01:44:41,439 --> 01:44:42,461
What's it gonna take?

1361
01:44:42,839 --> 01:44:44,931
Are you also suggesting
that she forgive Big?

1362
01:44:45,109 --> 01:44:49,271
No. I could kill Big.

1363
01:44:49,713 --> 01:44:52,113
Sometimes when I'm running...

1364
01:44:52,414 --> 01:44:56,715
...I imagine what I would say to him
if I ever saw him again.

1365
01:44:56,887 --> 01:44:59,913
I have the perfect opening line.

1366
01:45:00,091 --> 01:45:02,057
Do you wanna hear it?

1367
01:45:02,893 --> 01:45:05,020
Uh, yeah.

1368
01:45:06,263 --> 01:45:09,288
I curse the day you were born.

1369
01:45:10,601 --> 01:45:14,127
That's impressive. You better work up
a hand gesture to go with it.

1370
01:45:25,116 --> 01:45:27,084
I didn't know if it was the fashion...

1371
01:45:27,250 --> 01:45:30,048
...or the fact that the four of us
were together again...

1372
01:45:30,221 --> 01:45:32,951
...but for the first time in a long time...

1373
01:45:33,124 --> 01:45:35,524
...I felt like myself.

1374
01:46:06,592 --> 01:46:10,993
Well, let's get a cab, okay?
I'm absolutely starving. I don't know what...

1375
01:46:11,161 --> 01:46:12,753
Fur is murder!

1376
01:46:12,929 --> 01:46:16,363
Murder! Murder!

1377
01:46:16,533 --> 01:46:20,595
- Murder! Murder!
- God, I miss New York.

1378
01:46:23,504 --> 01:46:28,375
And a couple of weeks later, I met
Saint Louise's St. Louis boyfriend, Will.

1379
01:46:28,546 --> 01:46:31,344
Over Christmas, they realized
how much they loved each other.

1380
01:46:31,515 --> 01:46:33,176
- I'm Carrie.
- Will.

1381
01:46:33,751 --> 01:46:36,014
Just in time for Valentine's Day.

1382
01:47:01,878 --> 01:47:02,904
Hello?

1383
01:47:03,081 --> 01:47:06,413
I'm calling to make sure that you
aren't hanging from your shower rod.

1384
01:47:07,217 --> 01:47:11,017
- You called about an hour too early.
- So, what's the V-Day plan?

1385
01:47:11,188 --> 01:47:14,714
Well, Miranda and I are going to dinner...

1386
01:47:14,892 --> 01:47:17,291
...and then a very violent slasher movie.

1387
01:47:17,461 --> 01:47:19,053
- Perfect.
- You?

1388
01:47:19,429 --> 01:47:22,660
I'm making Smith sushi.
Pause for reaction.

1389
01:47:22,833 --> 01:47:24,699
Wow, you do that?

1390
01:47:24,869 --> 01:47:27,235
We took a class a while back.

1391
01:47:27,406 --> 01:47:29,532
And when he comes in that door
at 7:30...

1392
01:47:29,708 --> 01:47:33,700
...I'm going to surprise him by
laying naked on the dining-room table...

1393
01:47:33,879 --> 01:47:36,210
...covered with homemade sushi.

1394
01:47:36,381 --> 01:47:38,905
Boy, you do have time on your hands.

1395
01:47:39,350 --> 01:47:41,181
So, what else is new?

1396
01:48:04,808 --> 01:48:07,937
There is a whole lot of love in this room.

1397
01:48:08,113 --> 01:48:11,240
Is it me or is Valentine's Day
this year on steroids?

1398
01:48:11,415 --> 01:48:14,942
No. I think it was like this last year.
We just played for the other team.

1399
01:48:15,754 --> 01:48:18,813
Good evening.
This is our Valentine's night menu.

1400
01:48:18,991 --> 01:48:22,756
All of our specials are romantically themed
and designed to be split for two.

1401
01:48:22,926 --> 01:48:24,259
- Are we having wine?
- Yes.

1402
01:48:24,430 --> 01:48:25,657
- Glass or a...?
- Bottle.

1403
01:48:25,865 --> 01:48:28,764
I'll be right back to take
you and your girlfriend's order.

1404
01:48:35,206 --> 01:48:39,005
Why would you have looked
at the Vogue today of all days?

1405
01:48:39,175 --> 01:48:41,200
Because I'm an emotional cutter.

1406
01:48:42,381 --> 01:48:45,440
I deserve what I got.
Running all over New York...

1407
01:48:45,617 --> 01:48:48,084
...believing that I'm finally getting
my happy ending.

1408
01:48:48,251 --> 01:48:49,913
"See? Love does conquer all.

1409
01:48:50,086 --> 01:48:52,249
Look at me in
my one-of-a-kind wedding gown...

1410
01:48:52,424 --> 01:48:55,416
...marrying the love of my life. "
- Would you like another bot...?

1411
01:48:55,593 --> 01:48:56,992
- Yes.
- Yes.

1412
01:48:58,563 --> 01:49:01,690
And Miranda, in that article,
I did not say "we" once.

1413
01:49:02,134 --> 01:49:06,660
No. The whole article
was "I think" and "I want. "

1414
01:49:06,838 --> 01:49:09,897
- It was from your point of view.
- Yeah, exactly. My point of view.

1415
01:49:10,075 --> 01:49:13,375
Exactly. The whole wedding
was my point of view.

1416
01:49:14,578 --> 01:49:17,306
I let... I let the wedding
get bigger than Big.

1417
01:49:19,918 --> 01:49:23,353
I am the reason that
he did not get out of the car.

1418
01:49:24,991 --> 01:49:26,513
Okay.

1419
01:49:27,293 --> 01:49:31,819
I said something to Big
that I shouldn't have...

1420
01:49:31,997 --> 01:49:33,828
...at the rehearsal dinner.

1421
01:49:34,331 --> 01:49:35,822
What do you mean?

1422
01:49:37,135 --> 01:49:40,194
After Steve showed up,
I was really upset.

1423
01:49:40,372 --> 01:49:42,600
And I bumped into Big...

1424
01:49:45,309 --> 01:49:47,743
...and I said that you two
were crazy to get married.

1425
01:49:47,913 --> 01:49:50,244
Here we go, your Shiraz.

1426
01:49:59,791 --> 01:50:02,350
Okay, great. Thanks so much.

1427
01:50:06,799 --> 01:50:10,630
I'm sorry. I was upset. Steve had...

1428
01:50:10,801 --> 01:50:15,237
I have been going over this and over this
in my mind for five months.

1429
01:50:16,974 --> 01:50:20,602
And for five months,
you kept a secret like that?

1430
01:50:20,779 --> 01:50:23,305
- I tried to tell you once, but then...
- Once?

1431
01:50:23,483 --> 01:50:26,076
You tried to tell me once?

1432
01:50:26,551 --> 01:50:29,451
You should have tried to tell me
every single day.

1433
01:50:29,620 --> 01:50:32,054
I know. I was waiting for the right time.

1434
01:50:32,224 --> 01:50:35,124
There is no right time to tell me
that you ruined my marriage.

1435
01:50:35,292 --> 01:50:37,817
It just happened. I wasn't thinking.

1436
01:50:39,899 --> 01:50:43,664
- Carrie, please don't go.
- You know what I think hurts the most?

1437
01:50:44,535 --> 01:50:46,935
Is that you kept a secret from me.

1438
01:50:47,105 --> 01:50:51,405
And I have never, ever
kept a secret from you.

1439
01:50:51,576 --> 01:50:53,237
Ever.

1440
01:50:55,547 --> 01:50:57,674
No, I'm lying. For the last five months...

1441
01:50:57,849 --> 01:51:02,182
...I've been thinking that it is
a huge mistake that you left Steve.

1442
01:51:02,354 --> 01:51:03,821
There.

1443
01:51:04,756 --> 01:51:06,518
How does it feel?

1444
01:51:06,691 --> 01:51:09,591
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1445
01:51:29,748 --> 01:51:31,772
Any minute now.

1446
01:51:41,627 --> 01:51:43,527
Hey, babe, it's me. Pick up.

1447
01:51:44,329 --> 01:51:45,886
Pick up.

1448
01:51:46,299 --> 01:51:48,425
All right, it's 7:20. I'm still at the studio.

1449
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:52,560
We're behind. I'm gonna be a little bit late.
Sorry. Bye.

1450
01:52:02,247 --> 01:52:03,941
Forty minutes later...

1451
01:52:04,115 --> 01:52:08,483
...sushi, Samantha, still no Smith.

1452
01:52:15,027 --> 01:52:16,995
This is bullshit.

1453
01:52:48,228 --> 01:52:52,595
It was the same Valentine night
Samantha had planned...

1454
01:52:52,765 --> 01:52:54,959
...minus the sushi.

1455
01:52:56,535 --> 01:52:58,730
And the other woman.

1456
01:53:08,782 --> 01:53:10,611
I'm home.

1457
01:53:11,116 --> 01:53:13,915
- Man, that was a long day.
- You're three hours late.

1458
01:53:14,087 --> 01:53:16,417
Bummer, I know. Did you eat?

1459
01:53:16,589 --> 01:53:18,079
Yes, I ate.

1460
01:53:18,257 --> 01:53:20,384
I ate the sushi
that I hand-made for you.

1461
01:53:20,859 --> 01:53:25,796
The sushi that I laid all over my naked body
as a Valentine surprise for you.

1462
01:53:26,266 --> 01:53:28,789
Why are you so upset? I called.

1463
01:53:28,968 --> 01:53:30,799
I couldn't pick up the phone.

1464
01:53:30,970 --> 01:53:33,962
My body was covered everywhere
with sushi.

1465
01:53:34,141 --> 01:53:37,667
I got wasabi in places where
one should never get wasabi.

1466
01:53:37,842 --> 01:53:42,906
Oh, you think it's funny
that I slaved all day in this kitchen...

1467
01:53:43,083 --> 01:53:45,915
...to make a lovely meal for you?

1468
01:53:46,752 --> 01:53:50,280
You made some sushi. It's not a big deal.

1469
01:53:50,457 --> 01:53:52,616
"Not a big deal. " Here.

1470
01:53:53,427 --> 01:53:54,825
I am not the type of woman...

1471
01:53:54,994 --> 01:53:57,292
...who sits home all day
waiting for a man!

1472
01:53:58,432 --> 01:54:02,993
Enjoy your California handmade roll!

1473
01:54:05,171 --> 01:54:08,606
Happy fucking Valentine's Day.

1474
01:54:16,749 --> 01:54:18,581
It's Carrie, leave me a message.

1475
01:54:18,752 --> 01:54:21,447
Carrie, it's me. Please pick up.

1476
01:54:21,619 --> 01:54:26,250
Three days of
"I'm sorry" calls and e-mails and flowers...

1477
01:54:26,426 --> 01:54:28,359
...and I still wasn't ready.

1478
01:54:28,527 --> 01:54:32,053
It was the longest we'd ever gone
without speaking.

1479
01:54:38,704 --> 01:54:39,966
Carrie.

1480
01:54:40,539 --> 01:54:41,631
Hi.

1481
01:54:42,609 --> 01:54:46,203
- I need to talk to you.
- How long have you been waiting here?

1482
01:54:47,881 --> 01:54:49,643
Seventeen-dollars long.

1483
01:54:52,217 --> 01:54:54,379
Please get in. It just hit 18.

1484
01:55:08,067 --> 01:55:12,697
- This is weird, not talking.
- I'm upset.

1485
01:55:13,973 --> 01:55:18,604
Carrie, I understand, but it just happened.
I never meant to hurt you.

1486
01:55:23,082 --> 01:55:25,072
You have to forgive me.

1487
01:55:26,820 --> 01:55:28,012
You know...

1488
01:55:28,187 --> 01:55:29,210
- What?
- No.

1489
01:55:29,389 --> 01:55:31,480
No, please, what were you gonna say?

1490
01:55:31,657 --> 01:55:34,625
You badger me to forgive you
in three days.

1491
01:55:34,794 --> 01:55:38,732
You won't even consider forgiving Steve
for something he did six months ago.

1492
01:55:39,131 --> 01:55:40,689
It's not the same thing.

1493
01:55:41,736 --> 01:55:43,292
It's forgiveness.

1494
01:55:48,208 --> 01:55:51,041
I don't know that I can trust
that it won't happen again.

1495
01:55:52,612 --> 01:55:54,375
Steve, you're very quiet today.

1496
01:55:56,215 --> 01:56:00,515
Miranda, I know I made it hard
for you to trust me...

1497
01:56:03,788 --> 01:56:06,587
...but you made it hard for me to trust you.
- Me?

1498
01:56:06,759 --> 01:56:10,160
The way you treated me
and cut me out of your life like that.

1499
01:56:10,329 --> 01:56:12,992
I mean, yeah, I broke a vow...

1500
01:56:13,167 --> 01:56:16,135
...but what about the other vows?

1501
01:56:16,304 --> 01:56:20,261
Like promising to love someone
for better or for worse.

1502
01:56:20,440 --> 01:56:22,169
What about that?

1503
01:56:22,809 --> 01:56:25,972
How do I know she's not gonna
punish me for the rest of my life?

1504
01:56:26,145 --> 01:56:27,407
You don't.

1505
01:56:28,247 --> 01:56:32,776
And she doesn't know for sure that
you won't have another indiscretion.

1506
01:56:35,355 --> 01:56:38,416
All you can know is that
you wanna move forward...

1507
01:56:38,592 --> 01:56:42,995
...and risk that the love you have
for each other won't allow that to happen.

1508
01:56:46,299 --> 01:56:49,234
And that's what we'll discover here.

1509
01:56:55,042 --> 01:56:57,531
So we're done with our last session.

1510
01:56:57,710 --> 01:57:00,271
We're not allowed to talk to each other
for two weeks...

1511
01:57:00,447 --> 01:57:04,176
...while we figure out if being together
again is something that we really want.

1512
01:57:04,350 --> 01:57:07,807
And then we had to
pick a place to meet...

1513
01:57:07,987 --> 01:57:11,947
...and if we both show up on that day,
the past no longer exists.

1514
01:57:12,127 --> 01:57:14,821
It's like showing up
is the promise to each other...

1515
01:57:14,996 --> 01:57:19,557
...that we're both willing to
let it all go and move forward.

1516
01:57:19,733 --> 01:57:21,063
Wow.

1517
01:57:21,235 --> 01:57:23,668
- Can you do that?
- I don't know.

1518
01:57:23,838 --> 01:57:27,001
I don't know.
I have a lot of thinking to do.

1519
01:57:27,174 --> 01:57:30,801
- Thinking? Or feeling?
- What do you mean?

1520
01:57:30,977 --> 01:57:35,311
Well, Miranda, you're a lawyer. You know,
you can argue both sides of any case.

1521
01:57:35,483 --> 01:57:40,886
But why we feel what we feel
isn't logical. It's emotional.

1522
01:57:41,055 --> 01:57:42,919
So I'm sorry, Harvard, but I'm afraid...

1523
01:57:43,089 --> 01:57:46,547
...you're gonna have to base
this decision on your emotions.

1524
01:57:46,727 --> 01:57:49,921
Well, then I'm screwed.
I don't know what I feel.

1525
01:57:50,096 --> 01:57:52,496
You will. There will come a moment
when you know.

1526
01:57:52,666 --> 01:57:55,293
And if it's "yes,"
then all that brilliant logic...

1527
01:57:55,468 --> 01:57:58,062
...it's gonna go right out the window
with the past.

1528
01:57:58,239 --> 01:57:59,227
Ugh.

1529
01:57:59,405 --> 01:58:02,067
And I thought picking a spot to meet
was gonna be the challenge.

1530
01:58:02,241 --> 01:58:05,440
- Where is it?
- On the Brooklyn Bridge.

1531
01:58:06,615 --> 01:58:10,744
- Halfway between our two places.
- Very logical, and yet poetic.

1532
01:58:11,283 --> 01:58:13,479
Poetic if we both show up.

1533
01:58:13,653 --> 01:58:16,418
Otherwise you're on a bridge, rejected.

1534
01:58:17,690 --> 01:58:19,682
It's not a good plan.

1535
01:58:25,066 --> 01:58:27,193
- Hey.
Hey.

1536
01:58:27,701 --> 01:58:29,100
I got two pieces of good news.

1537
01:58:29,268 --> 01:58:31,932
- Oh, and I've got two coffees.
- Thank you.

1538
01:58:32,106 --> 01:58:33,835
Here you go. So, what's up?

1539
01:58:34,009 --> 01:58:37,944
I just heard from your realtor
and the apartment on 5th has finally sold.

1540
01:58:38,112 --> 01:58:42,548
You got 60 days before the new owner
takes possession, and you're out of there.

1541
01:58:44,084 --> 01:58:45,984
And what is the other news?

1542
01:58:50,958 --> 01:58:54,824
I'm moving back to St. Louis
and we're getting married in the fall.

1543
01:58:54,996 --> 01:58:56,427
Oh, my God.

1544
01:58:57,098 --> 01:58:59,965
Wait a minute, I gotta see that.

1545
01:59:00,165 --> 01:59:04,727
- Well, it's gorgeous.
- And you know what? It ain't rented.

1546
01:59:09,075 --> 01:59:11,167
On the day of her decision deadline...

1547
01:59:11,344 --> 01:59:14,973
...true to form, Miranda had argued
both sides of the case.

1548
01:59:15,149 --> 01:59:16,673
Thank you.

1549
01:59:38,706 --> 01:59:40,696
It suddenly dawned on Miranda...

1550
01:59:40,875 --> 01:59:44,936
...that Steve's list might have
had more cons than pros.

1551
02:00:30,192 --> 02:00:33,216
And Miranda never looked back.

1552
02:00:38,934 --> 02:00:42,368
Well, almost never.

1553
02:00:42,536 --> 02:00:44,162
Kiss me.

1554
02:00:48,942 --> 02:00:52,605
Meanwhile, back in Lost Angeles...

1555
02:00:55,450 --> 02:00:59,079
Turns out New Age philosophy
wasn't the secret.

1556
02:01:01,089 --> 02:01:04,718
Samantha had money, a career,
and a man who loved her.

1557
02:01:04,894 --> 02:01:08,851
But still, she couldn't shake the feeling
that something was missing from her life.

1558
02:01:09,029 --> 02:01:10,929
Baby, come back.

1559
02:01:11,432 --> 02:01:13,525
That's not our house.

1560
02:01:13,702 --> 02:01:16,363
Where are you going?

1561
02:01:53,340 --> 02:01:55,900
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

1562
02:01:56,077 --> 02:01:57,474
I'm your next-door neighbor...

1563
02:01:57,645 --> 02:02:00,342
...and my dog ran up on
your dick... Deck.

1564
02:02:03,284 --> 02:02:06,412
Suddenly it wasn't so secret
what she was missing.

1565
02:02:06,787 --> 02:02:08,119
Wanna join me?

1566
02:02:11,992 --> 02:02:13,550
Uh...

1567
02:02:18,065 --> 02:02:20,899
Hey. I'm Dante.

1568
02:02:21,068 --> 02:02:23,832
Stop by anytime.

1569
02:02:26,075 --> 02:02:28,134
It was official.

1570
02:02:28,310 --> 02:02:30,801
From the minute she met Dante...

1571
02:02:30,979 --> 02:02:34,073
...Samantha was in hell.

1572
02:02:35,952 --> 02:02:39,045
And by spring, I looked like my old self...

1573
02:02:39,220 --> 02:02:43,019
...in my new apartment,
just in time for the baby shower.

1574
02:02:43,191 --> 02:02:45,591
- Oh, excuse me, honey. Hi.
- Sure.

1575
02:02:45,760 --> 02:02:46,783
Hi.

1576
02:02:46,962 --> 02:02:49,487
A woman put a glass on your new desk
without a coaster.

1577
02:02:49,664 --> 02:02:52,222
I said, "If you do it again,
I'm gonna break your arm. "

1578
02:02:52,399 --> 02:02:53,423
- Thanks.
- Bathroom?

1579
02:02:53,602 --> 02:02:56,197
- Yes. Hey, how's it going?
- Pretty good, I think.

1580
02:02:56,372 --> 02:02:57,838
Good, good, good.

1581
02:02:58,006 --> 02:03:00,474
Where's Samantha?
Her plane landed two hours ago.

1582
02:03:00,642 --> 02:03:03,042
Oh, you know her.
She's probably working out first.

1583
02:03:03,211 --> 02:03:05,042
There's no place like home.

1584
02:03:05,214 --> 02:03:07,373
Sweetie.

1585
02:03:09,518 --> 02:03:10,849
You have a rat in your purse.

1586
02:03:11,020 --> 02:03:13,282
- That rat better be housebroken.
- Take your coat?

1587
02:03:13,456 --> 02:03:16,389
- Sure.
- Hey, cute bag.

1588
02:03:17,659 --> 02:03:19,147
Oh, my gosh, Samantha.

1589
02:03:21,428 --> 02:03:23,624
You have a dog.

1590
02:03:23,799 --> 02:03:26,767
Did you ever think you'd see the day?
Me with a pooch?

1591
02:03:26,935 --> 02:03:28,698
Mother of God, what's with the gut?

1592
02:03:30,706 --> 02:03:32,605
Well, she's eating something out there.

1593
02:03:33,475 --> 02:03:35,534
- Come on in!
Hi!

1594
02:03:35,710 --> 02:03:37,438
We've been waiting for you.

1595
02:03:41,317 --> 02:03:44,682
I eat so I won't cheat.

1596
02:03:44,853 --> 02:03:46,514
What exactly are you eating?

1597
02:03:46,922 --> 02:03:49,186
Everything except Dante's dick.

1598
02:03:49,356 --> 02:03:52,019
Language, please.
This is a grown-up apartment now.

1599
02:03:52,929 --> 02:03:56,057
I guess I didn't realize how big I was
until I saw it on your faces.

1600
02:03:56,233 --> 02:03:59,065
How...? And I say this with love.

1601
02:03:59,235 --> 02:04:01,758
How could you not realize it?

1602
02:04:01,938 --> 02:04:05,305
- I've been avoiding mirrors.
- Well, I'm proud of you for not cheating.

1603
02:04:05,475 --> 02:04:07,566
I don't think there's anything
to be proud of.

1604
02:04:07,743 --> 02:04:11,873
I stuff my face to stop myself from
doing something that feels natural to me.

1605
02:04:12,047 --> 02:04:16,279
Now, listen, this isn't about the weight.
You would look gorgeous at any size.

1606
02:04:16,451 --> 02:04:19,977
- But are you happy?
- Well...

1607
02:04:21,556 --> 02:04:26,790
...relationships aren't always
about being happy, right?

1608
02:04:26,963 --> 02:04:29,590
I mean, how often do you feel happy
in your relationship?

1609
02:04:30,432 --> 02:04:32,731
I'm pretty sure that's to you.

1610
02:04:33,869 --> 02:04:37,234
- Every day.
- You feel happy every day?

1611
02:04:37,406 --> 02:04:41,433
Not all day every day, but every day.

1612
02:04:41,611 --> 02:04:44,099
When was the last time you felt happy?

1613
02:04:44,279 --> 02:04:46,371
Six months ago.

1614
02:04:46,648 --> 02:04:49,582
I think that's normal for L.A.

1615
02:04:49,751 --> 02:04:52,481
- What am I gonna do?
- What's your gut tell you?

1616
02:04:55,824 --> 02:05:00,625
I know, but Smith stayed with me
through chemo.

1617
02:05:01,797 --> 02:05:04,630
And if he can stay with me
through that...

1618
02:05:04,799 --> 02:05:08,064
...then I should be able to
stay in this relationship for him.

1619
02:05:08,237 --> 02:05:11,968
Sweetie, you just compared
your relationship to chemo.

1620
02:05:12,140 --> 02:05:16,666
There we were,
the three mirrors Samantha couldn't avoid.

1621
02:05:16,844 --> 02:05:18,869
And Samantha?

1622
02:05:19,383 --> 02:05:21,942
That pillow cost $300.

1623
02:05:31,627 --> 02:05:33,594
Hi.

1624
02:05:33,762 --> 02:05:35,731
My little monster. Hi.

1625
02:05:37,400 --> 02:05:40,265
Hey. You're home.

1626
02:05:40,434 --> 02:05:43,994
- I thought you were staying the week.
- We need to talk.

1627
02:05:45,307 --> 02:05:47,570
Oh, man.

1628
02:05:49,445 --> 02:05:52,471
- I knew this was coming.
- Yeah.

1629
02:05:52,648 --> 02:05:54,514
This isn't working.

1630
02:05:54,684 --> 02:05:58,641
I've done my best.
I've given it five years and 15 pounds.

1631
02:05:58,821 --> 02:06:00,720
Well, what?

1632
02:06:02,893 --> 02:06:06,759
- You don't love me anymore?
- Yes, I love you.

1633
02:06:07,296 --> 02:06:08,523
It's just...

1634
02:06:10,865 --> 02:06:14,324
I'm just gonna say the thing
you're not supposed to say.

1635
02:06:14,870 --> 02:06:17,303
I love you but I love me more.

1636
02:06:17,473 --> 02:06:20,967
And I've been in a relationship
with myself for 49 years...

1637
02:06:21,145 --> 02:06:23,077
...and that's the one I need to work on.

1638
02:06:25,814 --> 02:06:30,219
You're gonna find a wonderful woman
who loves being in a relationship.

1639
02:06:33,423 --> 02:06:35,514
What will you find?

1640
02:06:36,159 --> 02:06:37,625
I don't know.

1641
02:06:38,326 --> 02:06:40,955
But that's a risk I'm willing to take.

1642
02:06:45,400 --> 02:06:50,169
- Hey, no. Keep it.
- Okay.

1643
02:06:53,075 --> 02:06:55,635
Every time I look down at it...

1644
02:06:59,014 --> 02:07:01,278
...I'm gonna think of you.

1645
02:07:03,586 --> 02:07:07,647
Some love stories aren't epic novels.
Some are short stories.

1646
02:07:07,824 --> 02:07:11,758
But that doesn't make them
any less filled with love.

1647
02:07:12,262 --> 02:07:13,728
At this time...

1648
02:07:13,896 --> 02:07:16,161
...we ask that all passengers
fasten their seat belts...

1649
02:07:16,333 --> 02:07:18,733
...in preparation for landing.

1650
02:07:19,202 --> 02:07:22,261
We're landing in New York.

1651
02:07:22,671 --> 02:07:24,264
I'm gonna need to take that now.

1652
02:07:26,976 --> 02:07:29,740
Okay. Here we go now. Give me that.

1653
02:07:32,948 --> 02:07:35,849
As someone returned to my life...

1654
02:07:36,018 --> 02:07:37,042
...someone left.

1655
02:07:37,219 --> 02:07:39,380
- Stamps, mailing labels.
- Okay.

1656
02:07:39,556 --> 02:07:43,185
And I put all your unopened mail
from your P.O. Box in these envelopes.

1657
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:44,884
All right.

1658
02:07:48,798 --> 02:07:50,959
And please, please...

1659
02:07:51,133 --> 02:07:54,193
...do not make a mess
out of CarrieBradshaw. Com.

1660
02:07:54,371 --> 02:07:57,828
- Okay.
- It's my masterpiece.

1661
02:07:58,807 --> 02:08:02,436
- What am I gonna do without you?
- You'll find some other girl...

1662
02:08:03,079 --> 02:08:05,012
...but she won't have my style.

1663
02:08:06,047 --> 02:08:08,072
Saint Louise.

1664
02:08:09,620 --> 02:08:11,347
You brought me back to life.

1665
02:08:11,954 --> 02:08:15,391
And you gave me Louise Vuitton.

1666
02:08:21,765 --> 02:08:25,166
Serious. We need to stop crying.

1667
02:08:26,435 --> 02:08:28,596
- Your keys.
- Oh, thanks.

1668
02:08:28,772 --> 02:08:32,036
Wait, wait, wait. Don't forget your love.

1669
02:08:32,908 --> 02:08:36,139
No. I found my love.

1670
02:08:36,446 --> 02:08:38,878
I'm leaving that with you.

1671
02:08:39,583 --> 02:08:43,576
- See you at my wedding.
- I'll meet you in St. Louis.

1672
02:08:47,524 --> 02:08:49,015
Bye.

1673
02:08:55,732 --> 02:08:57,426
And a couple of weeks later...

1674
02:08:57,601 --> 02:09:00,764
...a slow-moving Charlotte
grabbed a quick lunch.

1675
02:09:00,938 --> 02:09:02,733
- Well, when are you due?
- Next week.

1676
02:09:02,904 --> 02:09:06,101
- You look gorgeous.
- Oh, thank you.

1677
02:09:18,054 --> 02:09:21,683
- Hi. Can I get you something to drink?
- No, no.

1678
02:09:21,859 --> 02:09:24,258
- No?
- No. I can't stay.

1679
02:09:24,728 --> 02:09:27,389
Help me. Help me move the table.

1680
02:09:30,900 --> 02:09:32,491
Charlotte.

1681
02:09:33,437 --> 02:09:35,596
Charlotte, wait. Wait.

1682
02:09:35,770 --> 02:09:39,035
Charlotte. Charlotte, don't run,
you're pregnant.

1683
02:09:39,208 --> 02:09:42,906
I don't wanna see you.
I'm so mad at you.

1684
02:09:43,080 --> 02:09:47,778
I was always on your side.
And then you go and you do that to Carrie.

1685
02:09:47,951 --> 02:09:53,287
No! No! I'm not gonna cry.
I'm not gonna waste tears on you.

1686
02:09:54,557 --> 02:09:57,457
I curse the day you were born.

1687
02:10:01,264 --> 02:10:03,788
I think my water just broke. Oh, my God.

1688
02:10:03,968 --> 02:10:06,094
- Taxi!
- My car's right there.

1689
02:10:06,268 --> 02:10:08,897
I don't wanna get in your car! Taxi!

1690
02:10:09,073 --> 02:10:11,666
Please, I gotta get you
to the hospital, okay? Please?

1691
02:10:12,642 --> 02:10:13,665
- Okay?
Lenox Hill.

1692
02:10:13,844 --> 02:10:15,435
Okay. Start the car.

1693
02:10:24,320 --> 02:10:25,311
Hey.

1694
02:10:25,489 --> 02:10:29,652
Hi. Congratulations. A girl.

1695
02:10:30,125 --> 02:10:32,923
It's my lot in life to be surrounded
by beautiful women.

1696
02:10:33,697 --> 02:10:35,130
Come here.

1697
02:10:40,438 --> 02:10:43,930
- She's gorgeous.
- Say hello to Rose.

1698
02:10:44,109 --> 02:10:48,601
- Rose. What a beautiful name.
- It's after Harry's bubbe.

1699
02:10:48,778 --> 02:10:51,974
Now we got a Lily and a Rose.

1700
02:10:52,651 --> 02:10:54,083
Well...

1701
02:10:54,251 --> 02:10:58,049
...I have to say,
you two are very cool customers...

1702
02:10:58,222 --> 02:11:03,454
...making the "baby's here" call
without all the "I'm in labor" drama.

1703
02:11:03,626 --> 02:11:06,219
There was plenty of drama.

1704
02:11:07,162 --> 02:11:09,961
My water broke while I was standing
in front of a restaurant.

1705
02:11:10,368 --> 02:11:14,531
- Wow, that's very dramatic.
- Wait, wait, she's not done.

1706
02:11:14,706 --> 02:11:17,696
- It broke while I was talking to Big.
- What?

1707
02:11:17,874 --> 02:11:19,934
See? Drama.

1708
02:11:20,112 --> 02:11:22,738
I ran into him and
I got so upset, my water broke.

1709
02:11:23,749 --> 02:11:27,478
He brought her to the hospital,
stayed until the baby was born.

1710
02:11:28,652 --> 02:11:31,211
I think he was hoping to see you.

1711
02:11:34,324 --> 02:11:38,525
Well, today is not about him.
It's about beautiful baby Rose.

1712
02:11:39,663 --> 02:11:43,222
So we know she has Charlotte's hair.
What else do we know?

1713
02:11:45,969 --> 02:11:49,929
- She's a doll. Mazel tov.
- Thank you.

1714
02:11:50,941 --> 02:11:52,406
Bye.

1715
02:11:52,778 --> 02:11:55,906
He asked me to ask you to call him.

1716
02:11:56,781 --> 02:11:59,841
I know, it's none of my business,
but I felt bad for the schmuck...

1717
02:12:00,017 --> 02:12:02,313
...hanging around the hospital
hoping to see you.

1718
02:12:02,485 --> 02:12:07,184
Every time he heard someone in heels
walking down the hall, his heart stopped.

1719
02:12:09,060 --> 02:12:13,496
Harry, it's... It's so much more complicated
than you can imagine.

1720
02:12:13,665 --> 02:12:17,623
I know it is, and you have every right
to never call him, but I just...

1721
02:12:17,802 --> 02:12:21,670
I'm a big pile of love today
and I feel bad for the guy.

1722
02:12:21,838 --> 02:12:24,739
He said he's been writing you,
but you never responded.

1723
02:12:26,377 --> 02:12:27,808
No, he's never written to me.

1724
02:12:27,978 --> 02:12:31,070
He said he wrote because
he didn't have your phone number.

1725
02:12:32,117 --> 02:12:35,051
No, he's never written. Ever.

1726
02:12:35,219 --> 02:12:38,245
Then why would he say he had?

1727
02:13:18,629 --> 02:13:23,588
Two hours, two manila envelopes
and countless e-mails later...

1728
02:13:23,767 --> 02:13:27,897
...I was just about to give up
on the big riddle when...

1729
02:13:28,072 --> 02:13:32,599
I had told Louise to put Big in a place where
I would never have to hear from him again.

1730
02:13:44,757 --> 02:13:46,189
This is Louise, leave a message.

1731
02:13:46,357 --> 02:13:48,348
Hey... Hey, Louise, it's me.

1732
02:13:48,527 --> 02:13:52,894
Can you give me the password
for your assistant file?

1733
02:13:53,064 --> 02:13:54,496
Um...

1734
02:13:54,666 --> 02:13:57,066
Okay, call me. Thanks.

1735
02:13:59,371 --> 02:14:01,598
Oh, shit.

1736
02:14:17,922 --> 02:14:21,483
As soon as I typed in "love,"
there he was.

1737
02:14:26,764 --> 02:14:29,062
And because Big
still didn't have the words...

1738
02:14:29,234 --> 02:14:31,930
...he retyped a love letter
from Beethoven.

1739
02:14:34,039 --> 02:14:35,266
And Lord Byron.

1740
02:14:36,875 --> 02:14:39,208
And John Keats.

1741
02:14:39,545 --> 02:14:40,841
And Voltaire.

1742
02:14:41,546 --> 02:14:45,641
There they were, the love letters
of great men, volume one.

1743
02:14:45,816 --> 02:14:50,254
Plus one more
written by John James Preston.

1744
02:15:06,472 --> 02:15:08,961
I wanted to call him, but our love...

1745
02:15:09,141 --> 02:15:12,370
...Carrie and Big,
volumes one, two and three...

1746
02:15:12,844 --> 02:15:14,744
...stopped me.

1747
02:15:20,085 --> 02:15:21,109
Hello?

1748
02:15:21,285 --> 02:15:24,255
I didn't hear my phone.
We're shopping for my wedding gown.

1749
02:15:24,422 --> 02:15:26,583
That dress makes your boobies look big.

1750
02:15:26,758 --> 02:15:29,625
- Mama, can you please? This is a work call.
- Shut up.

1751
02:15:29,795 --> 02:15:34,594
- No, it's okay, I figured it out.
- Well, I was gonna call you anyway.

1752
02:15:34,767 --> 02:15:37,098
Today is the final day
on the 5th Avenue apartment.

1753
02:15:37,268 --> 02:15:39,461
You have till 6:00
before they change the locks.

1754
02:15:39,639 --> 02:15:41,402
No, I don't need to go over there.

1755
02:15:41,973 --> 02:15:43,907
Do you not want those never-worn shoes?

1756
02:15:44,075 --> 02:15:46,440
Oh, God, I completely forgot.

1757
02:15:46,610 --> 02:15:50,237
If you don't, you can send them to me
and I'll squeeze my feet into them.

1758
02:15:50,415 --> 02:15:52,280
But it's already 5:00.

1759
02:15:52,449 --> 02:15:55,940
Hello? They are never-been-worn,
$400 shoes.

1760
02:15:56,121 --> 02:16:00,992
Actually 525.
Yeah, okay. All right, thanks. Bye.

1761
02:16:01,827 --> 02:16:03,885
Taxi!

1762
02:16:13,339 --> 02:16:16,830
The light in our prewar apartment...

1763
02:16:17,008 --> 02:16:20,307
...looked completely different postwar.

1764
02:16:40,931 --> 02:16:45,632
I was gonna get these to you.
I didn't want it to be a total loss.

1765
02:16:45,938 --> 02:16:49,805
It wasn't logic, it was love.

1766
02:17:10,930 --> 02:17:13,898
Why did we ever decide to get married?

1767
02:17:16,067 --> 02:17:21,562
I guess we were afraid
it would mean something if we didn't.

1768
02:17:25,812 --> 02:17:28,644
I'm sorry to have done that to you.

1769
02:17:29,581 --> 02:17:32,277
I'm sorry to have done that to you.

1770
02:17:36,255 --> 02:17:38,346
You know the funny part?

1771
02:17:40,392 --> 02:17:42,586
Is there a funny part?

1772
02:17:42,762 --> 02:17:47,061
We were perfectly happy before
we decided to live happily ever after.

1773
02:17:47,532 --> 02:17:49,397
Guess the joke's on us.

1774
02:17:58,444 --> 02:18:02,312
- It's a good closet.
- Thanks.

1775
02:18:05,584 --> 02:18:07,949
It's comfortable.

1776
02:18:08,320 --> 02:18:11,651
Is this what you had in mind
when you installed the carpet?

1777
02:18:12,692 --> 02:18:15,683
I'd like to think I was that smooth.

1778
02:18:23,101 --> 02:18:26,936
We better get up
before the new owners bust in on us.

1779
02:18:36,015 --> 02:18:39,745
And the way we decided to get married...

1780
02:18:39,919 --> 02:18:41,852
...it was all business.

1781
02:18:42,020 --> 02:18:44,147
No romance.

1782
02:18:46,659 --> 02:18:51,755
That's not the way
you propose to someone.

1783
02:18:53,199 --> 02:18:55,167
This is.

1784
02:18:58,705 --> 02:19:00,764
Carrie Bradshaw...

1785
02:19:01,474 --> 02:19:02,838
...love of my life...

1786
02:19:05,743 --> 02:19:07,768
...will you marry me?

1787
02:19:12,651 --> 02:19:14,981
See, this is why there's a diamond.

1788
02:19:15,154 --> 02:19:17,281
You need to do something
to close the deal.

1789
02:19:41,847 --> 02:19:43,040
And forsaking all others...

1790
02:19:43,216 --> 02:19:47,117
And in the end, Carrie Bradshaw
married John James Preston...

1791
02:19:47,287 --> 02:19:48,949
...in a label-less dress.
- I do.

1792
02:19:49,421 --> 02:19:52,084
Then by the power vested in me
by the state of New York...

1793
02:19:52,260 --> 02:19:56,820
...I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

1794
02:20:07,439 --> 02:20:09,405
Ever thine. Ever mine.

1795
02:20:10,210 --> 02:20:12,871
Ever ours.

1796
02:20:15,315 --> 02:20:17,645
So you're okay that it was just us?

1797
02:20:17,816 --> 02:20:22,378
It was perfect. You and me, like I said.

1798
02:20:22,556 --> 02:20:25,819
Still, it would have been nice
if you had the girls here.

1799
02:20:27,493 --> 02:20:29,893
Which is why I called them.

1800
02:20:34,202 --> 02:20:36,895
- Hi, Carrie!
- Mazel tov!

1801
02:20:40,105 --> 02:20:43,200
- Ham and eggs. Ham and eggs for you, sir.
- Yup, that's me.

1802
02:20:43,376 --> 02:20:46,035
It wasn't a fancy, designer reception either.

1803
02:20:46,579 --> 02:20:48,706
Just food and friends.

1804
02:20:50,917 --> 02:20:52,781
Butter, ma'am?

1805
02:20:55,055 --> 02:20:56,749
How's the marriage going?

1806
02:21:16,943 --> 02:21:22,107
"And as I put the wedding gown away,
I couldn't help but wonder:

1807
02:21:22,282 --> 02:21:26,481
'Why is it that we're willing
to write our own vows...

1808
02:21:26,653 --> 02:21:30,145
...but not our own rules?"'

1809
02:21:30,390 --> 02:21:32,879
And that's just a little something
I'm working on.

1810
02:21:35,329 --> 02:21:37,091
Thank you.

1811
02:21:38,765 --> 02:21:40,424
Oh, my God.

1812
02:21:42,868 --> 02:21:45,495
Maybe some labels
are best left in the closet.

1813
02:21:45,671 --> 02:21:47,196
Maybe when we label people:

1814
02:21:47,375 --> 02:21:51,606
"Bride," "groom," "husband,"
"wife," "married," "single"...

1815
02:21:51,778 --> 02:21:55,270
...we forget to look past the label
to the person.

1816
02:21:56,484 --> 02:21:59,507
- This is delicious.
- Why did we ever stop drinking these?

1817
02:21:59,685 --> 02:22:03,314
- Because everyone else started.
- Well, that one's an oldie but goodie.

1818
02:22:03,490 --> 02:22:06,288
And speaking of an oldie but goodie...

1819
02:22:09,228 --> 02:22:11,322
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

1820
02:22:12,298 --> 02:22:14,322
Wait, wait, wait. A toast.

1821
02:22:14,501 --> 02:22:16,024
To Samantha.

1822
02:22:16,203 --> 02:22:18,966
Fifty and fabulous.

1823
02:22:25,077 --> 02:22:26,909
To us...

1824
02:22:28,649 --> 02:22:29,741
...and the next 50.

1825
02:22:29,917 --> 02:22:32,215
To the next 50.

1826
02:22:34,320 --> 02:22:38,690
And there, in the same city
where they met as girls...

1827
02:22:38,859 --> 02:22:43,190
...four New York women
entered the next phase of their lives...

1828
02:22:43,362 --> 02:22:46,992
...dressed head to toe in love.

1829
02:22:47,635 --> 02:22:49,829
