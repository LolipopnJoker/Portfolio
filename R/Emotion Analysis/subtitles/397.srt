- We're...
- We're...

20
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:13,535
Sophie, Ali, Lisa!
We're the greatest, bestest mates!

21
00:03:13,618 --> 00:03:14,661
- I'm tough.
- I'm tall.

22
00:03:14,744 --> 00:03:16,663
- I'm tiny.
And we're gonna rock this place.

23

- Sophie, it's beautiful.
- I want one.

25
00:03:25,255 --> 00:03:27,048
I'm getting married tomorrow.

26
00:03:27,132 --> 00:03:28,341
I'm so glad you're here,

27
00:03:28,425 --> 00:03:33,179
because I have a secret
and I can't tell anybody else.

28
00:03:33,263 --> 00:03:37,183
- Sophie, you're knocked up?
- No! No! No!

29
00:03:38,393 --> 00:03:40,520
I've invited my dad to my wedding.

30
00:03:40,645 --> 00:03:42,313
You are joking!

31
00:03:42,397 --> 00:03:46,109
- You found him at last?
- No! No, no, no, no, no, not exactly.

32
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:53,950
Okay. You know what my mom always said
when I asked about my father.

33
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:56,119
It was a summer romance,

34
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:59,456
and he'd gone long before she realised
that she was expecting me.

35
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:02,709
And I'd always kind of accepted that
that's all I'd ever know.

36
00:04:02,792 --> 00:04:06,796
Well, I was ransacking some old trunks
and I found this.

37
00:04:08,465 --> 00:04:11,259
It's the diary she kept
the year she was pregnant with me.

38
00:04:11,342 --> 00:04:13,762
Sophie!

39
00:04:13,845 --> 00:04:17,932
"July 17th. What a night!"

40
00:04:18,016 --> 00:04:20,226

- I do!

142
00:10:08,366 --> 00:10:10,201

I'm getting married tomorrow.

143
00:10:10,285 --> 00:10:11,619
Please be careful.

144
00:10:11,703 --> 00:10:13,705
So?
There are pins in the dresses.

145
00:10:13,788 --> 00:10:15,457
What do you think?

146
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,542
Oh, yes!

147
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,294
"Oh, yes." If you had your way,

148
00:10:19,377 --> 00:10:22,213
it'd be a three-minute wedding
in jeans and T-shirts,

149
00:10:22,297 --> 00:10:24,007
washed down with a bottle of beer.

150
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,301
You make me sound so unromantic!

151
00:10:26,384 --> 00:10:28,261
I just thought we should save
our money for travelling.

152
00:10:28,344 --> 00:10:30,180
Well, we're not going anywhere yet.

153
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:33,224
Anyway, please leave. We're very, very busy.

154
00:10:33,308 --> 00:10:35,268
I'm just getting some props for tonight.

155
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:38,897
For his bachelor party.

156
00:10:42,067 --> 00:10:44,402
Why haven't you told him
you've invited your dads?

157
00:10:44,486 --> 00:10:46,738
Because he would say that
I'd have to tell my mom.

158
00:10:46,821 --> 00:10:48,907
Donna's absolutely gonna kill you
when she finds out.

159
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,910
By the time she finds out, it'll be too late.

160
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:56,081
I feel like there's a part of me missing,

161
00:10:57,624 --> 00:10:59,584
and when I meet my dad,

162
00:11:02,253 --> 00:11:06,716
everything will fall into place.

163
00:11:13,765 --> 00:11:15,892
More open!
I'm on it. I'm on it.

164
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,352
That's good.

165
00:11:19,396 --> 00:11:20,563
That's it.

166
00:11:28,947 --> 00:11:30,740
Come on, Cleopatra.

167
00:11:38,373 --> 00:11:39,416
My shoe!

168
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:46,798
Will you look at what the tide washed in?

169
00:11:48,383 --> 00:11:53,096
- For one night.
- And one night only.

170
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:59,102
- Donna and the Dynamos!
- Donna and the Dynamos!

171
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,028
Look at you!

172
00:12:09,112 --> 00:12:11,364

- Look at you!

173
00:12:11,448 --> 00:12:12,782
You look fantastic!

174
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:14,075
You look like an old hippie!

175
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:15,952
She looks fab.

176
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:18,288
These are new, though.
Where did you get these?

177
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:20,623
Husband number three!

178
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:24,210
- Dynamos! Dynamite!
- Dynamos! Dynamite!

179
00:12:24,294 --> 00:12:26,171
Sleep all day and...

180
00:12:26,254 --> 00:12:28,006
All night!

181
00:12:34,804 --> 00:12:36,973
So, any men at this wedding?

182
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:39,517
Gorgeous Greeks of independent means?

183
00:12:39,601 --> 00:12:42,854
Here we go! Husband number four!

184
00:12:42,937 --> 00:12:46,733
- No! Not for me, for her!
- He's coming!

185
00:12:46,816 --> 00:12:49,194
For her, now that her book is a bestseller,

186
00:12:49,277 --> 00:12:52,864
and she's got the whole world
stuffing, what,

187
00:12:52,947 --> 00:12:56,910
mushrooms? Various vegetables?

188
00:12:56,993 --> 00:12:58,870
It's time to find Mr Right!

189
00:12:58,953 --> 00:13:01,998
Oh, please. Boring!

190
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:05,043
Great couple of role models
you two are for Sophie!

191
00:13:05,126 --> 00:13:08,129
A serial bride and a little hermit over here!

192
00:13:09,047 --> 00:13:11,633
That's me! I'm a lone wolf!

193
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,848
So, when are the lovebirds
flying the nest?

194
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:22,102
Oh, God! Who knows?

195
00:13:22,185 --> 00:13:26,815
You know, I do not know what is going on
in that child's head sometimes.

196
00:13:26,898 --> 00:13:29,484
She wants a big white wedding, and

197
00:13:29,567 --> 00:13:32,529
she and Sky are making
all kinds of plans for the hotel.

198
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:34,697
Sometimes I think they'll never leave.

199
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:37,242
Yeah, but do you really want her to?

200
00:13:37,325 --> 00:13:39,702
Well, I want what's best for her.

201
00:13:39,911 --> 00:13:40,954
Of course not!

202
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:46,459
Sky! Come meet my backup girls.

203
00:13:46,543 --> 00:13:48,420
Backup girls, my ass!
Backup girls, my ass!

204
00:13:48,503 --> 00:13:50,380
He's the leading man at tomorrow's shindig.

205
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,090
The lucky man.
- Hello.

206
00:13:52,173 --> 00:13:54,676
- You must be Rosie.
- I am.

207
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:56,720
- How are you?
- Very well.

208
00:13:57,762 --> 00:13:59,597
And you must be Tanya.

209
00:14:00,014 --> 00:14:03,601
- I've heard so much about you.
- All bad, I hope.

210
00:14:03,685 --> 00:14:05,103
- Yes.
- And all true.

211
00:14:05,186 --> 00:14:06,438
Donna... Here, let me get them.

212
00:14:08,773 --> 00:14:12,110
I know who you are.
You're Bill Anderson, aren't you?

213
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:17,866
♫ - Bloke in a Boat in Botswana. ♫
- Yes, I am.

214
00:14:17,949 --> 00:14:21,119
You know, your books are a godsend
on dull business trips.

215
00:14:21,202 --> 00:14:24,038
Now, I may look like I'm pondering
my securities, but in reality,

216
00:14:24,122 --> 00:14:28,752
I'm trekking across
some remote corner of the planet.

217
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:30,795
You should try it for real sometime.

218
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:33,923
No, certainly, I'll never be
the spontaneous adventurer.

219
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:38,261
- You're a close friend of Donna's?
- No, I haven't heard from her for 20 years.

220
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:41,014
Really?
- And then this invite, out of the blue.

221
00:14:41,097 --> 00:14:42,849
You know, that's a coincidence,
neither had I.

222
00:14:42,932 --> 00:14:45,477
- Going about!
- You got it!

223
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:50,857
Right. Wait...
I've got it. Fine. Fine.

224
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:55,487
You should have brought
the iron lung.

225
00:14:55,612 --> 00:14:58,073
Why did I wear stilettos?

226
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:00,950
- Oxygen.
- Oh, my God!

227
00:15:02,577 --> 00:15:04,871
- Auntie Rosie!
- Hey, hey!

228
00:15:04,954 --> 00:15:09,292
- Look at Sophie. She's gotten so beautiful!
- I know.

229
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,795
Come here to me.

230
00:15:13,296 --> 00:15:20,220
Sophie Sheridan, you get more gorgeous
every time I see you. You do.

231
00:15:20,303 --> 00:15:24,307
- I bet you don't remember me.
- Not with all that plastic surgery.

232
00:15:25,016 --> 00:15:28,728
Of course I do, Auntie Tanya.
You haven't changed at all.

233
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:31,147
- I'm so happy for you.
- Look at my baby,

234
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:33,900
her whole life ahead of her.

235
00:15:33,983 --> 00:15:39,239
Oh, please, I'm getting married.
I'm not joining a convent!

236
00:15:39,322 --> 00:15:41,324
- She's feisty. I love that.
- Yeah.

237
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:43,701
She's a chip off the old block.

238
00:15:44,494 --> 00:15:47,664
If she were more like me,
she wouldn't be getting married at 20.

239
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:49,416
Or married at all.

240
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,670
I meant to get the laundry down
before you came.

241
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:54,796
Tanya's going home!

242
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:57,841
And you'd think with all this
new technology,

243
00:15:57,924 --> 00:16:00,885
they would figure out a machine
that would make the beds.

244
00:16:00,969 --> 00:16:03,221
And if they did,
you'd be going along behind it,

245
00:16:03,304 --> 00:16:04,639
making them again.

246
00:16:04,723 --> 00:16:06,349
I know you, Mom.

247
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:11,479
But I am good at modern...
Tell them about the Internets.

248
00:16:11,563 --> 00:16:13,690
- He's gonna put me on the line.
Online.

249
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:15,150
I'm designing a website.

250
00:16:15,233 --> 00:16:19,404
I just think this place has so much potential,
and no one knows we're here.

251
00:16:19,487 --> 00:16:23,867
So, if I market it really, really well, then,
hopefully, people will come flooding in.

252
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:27,871
We just want this to be
the ultimate romantic destination.

253
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:30,331
This was once supposed to be
the site of Aphrodite's fountain,

254
00:16:30,415 --> 00:16:32,917
you know, the goddess of love.
And if you drank the water,

255
00:16:33,001 --> 00:16:35,712
you were supposed to find true love
and perfect happiness.

256
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:38,715
- I'll have a glass of that.
- Yeah, I'll have a bucket.

257
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,675
♫ Aphrodite's spa? ♫

258
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:43,261
Well, I thought you didn't want
boatloads of tourists.

259
00:16:43,386 --> 00:16:45,388
Oh, no, not boatloads, no.

260
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:48,892
But, you know, a few more would be nice.

261
00:16:50,268 --> 00:16:54,230
Okay, now, the thing about the toilet,

262
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:59,402
if it doesn't flush right away, just go
and come back in a while, and it should...

263
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:03,073
Nothing works around here, except for me.

264
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:07,410
I've been running this hotel for 15 years,
and I have never had a day off.

265
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:08,745

Do you feel it?

The earth moved, darling.
We're falling apart here.

320
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:14,139
Don't think about it, come on.
Let's go have fun.

321
00:20:24,733 --> 00:20:26,985
Tanya's packed for a world tour.

322
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:30,155
Oh, Donna. Donna!

323
00:20:30,613 --> 00:20:32,949
Does she wear it or floss with it?

324
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:34,242
Floss you.

325
00:20:34,325 --> 00:20:35,452
Is it edible, Tanya?

326
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:36,619
Listen to this.

327
00:20:37,829 --> 00:20:40,123
"The world's most luxurious moisturiser

328
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:42,917
"contains flakes of 24-carat gold

329
00:20:43,001 --> 00:20:45,128
"and extracts of donkey testicle."

330
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:46,671
You're just jealous.

331
00:20:46,755 --> 00:20:48,965
At a thousand dollars a dollop.

332
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:50,633
Tell you, that's the price you have to pay

333
00:20:50,717 --> 00:20:53,178
if you wanna drink before 11:00
in the morning.

334
00:20:53,261 --> 00:20:55,388
- And we do.
- We do.

335
00:20:57,474 --> 00:20:58,516
Hi.

336
00:20:59,851 --> 00:21:00,935
May I help you?

337
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:03,021
Sure, we're here for the wedding.

338
00:21:03,104 --> 00:21:04,773
- I'm Bill Anderson.

339
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:07,233
I'm Bright, Harry Bright.

340
00:21:08,443 --> 00:21:09,986
Sam Carmichael.

341
00:21:16,785 --> 00:21:18,578
You are expecting us?

342
00:21:18,703 --> 00:21:20,622
Oh, my God. Yes!

343
00:21:21,372 --> 00:21:23,500
You're not Donna's daughter?

344
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,503
I thought you looked familiar.

345
00:21:26,878 --> 00:21:28,171
Sofia.

346
00:21:28,254 --> 00:21:30,965
- It's Sophie.
- Well, Sofia is the Greek.

347
00:21:31,174 --> 00:21:33,802
Well, I'm named after a Sofia.

348
00:21:33,885 --> 00:21:38,223
I used to have a great-aunt
living on the mainland named Sofia.

349
00:21:38,973 --> 00:21:42,268
Would you mind if we see our rooms
before we see your mother?

350
00:21:42,352 --> 00:21:43,436
Sure.

351
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,022
It's just that I'd quite like to freshen up
before the big reunion.

352
00:21:46,106 --> 00:21:49,609
No! No! I mean, yes,

353
00:21:49,692 --> 00:21:51,277
but come this way.

354
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:06,042
Come on!

355
00:22:11,673 --> 00:22:13,216
Oh, my God!

356
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:16,261
I got a crack in my courtyard.
I gotta go fix it.

357
00:22:16,344 --> 00:22:18,430
- Hey, listen, Donna? Donna.
- I'm serious. Move.

358
00:22:19,514 --> 00:22:20,598
Sit down!

359
00:22:20,682 --> 00:22:22,058
- She won't let me go!
- I know...

360
00:22:22,142 --> 00:22:24,769
I know you're going to make
a fortune with web's...

361
00:22:24,853 --> 00:22:27,397
- "With web's..."
- With Sky's site.

362
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,023
I know you're gonna make a fortune with

363
00:22:29,107 --> 00:22:31,443
- Sky's website, but...
- It's good.

364
00:22:31,526 --> 00:22:33,403
Are you gonna be okay until then?

365
00:22:33,486 --> 00:22:35,947
I think Tanya is offering to pawn her bling.

366
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:38,450
- No, seriously, Donna...
- Oh, my God.

367
00:22:38,533 --> 00:22:40,785
- Do you need a loan?
- No, sweet.

368
00:22:40,869 --> 00:22:44,497
Oh, God, I'm just whining, you know me.

369
00:22:44,581 --> 00:22:46,833
I don't need to be taken care of.

370
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:49,544
Yeah, but are you being taken care of?

371
00:22:49,627 --> 00:22:52,297
- What do you mean?
- Are you getting any?

372
00:22:52,756 --> 00:22:53,798
Oh, you mean...

373
00:22:59,012 --> 00:23:02,098
Down, boy, down, boy.
No, it takes too much energy.

374
00:23:02,182 --> 00:23:05,226
Yeah. Just more plumbing
to be maintained, isn't it?

375
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,603
Yeah.

376
00:23:06,686 --> 00:23:10,607
Oh, God, I'm so glad
that whole part of my life is over.

377
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,275
You know, seriously.

378
00:23:13,485 --> 00:23:15,820
I do not miss it at all.

379
00:23:20,283 --> 00:23:22,994
Then it's just right here. Good.

380
00:23:25,622 --> 00:23:27,791
Where's Donna? Hey! Okay.

381
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:31,336
Up you go.

382
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,057
You know,

383
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:47,352
I don't want to seem ungrateful
for the scenic tour,

384
00:23:47,435 --> 00:23:48,978
but might I be shown my room now?

385
00:23:49,062 --> 00:23:52,399
Well, don't hold your breath, Harry,
but I think this is your room.

386
00:23:52,482 --> 00:23:53,983
Can we see Donna now?

387
00:23:55,193 --> 00:23:56,945
I sent the invites.

388
00:23:57,487 --> 00:23:59,489
My mom doesn't know anything.

389
00:24:02,158 --> 00:24:05,286
Well, she's done so much for me,
and she's always talking about you guys

390
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:07,330
and the good old days, and

391
00:24:07,455 --> 00:24:09,833
I thought, what an amazing surprise for her

392
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:12,460
that you are all gonna be at my wedding.

393
00:24:12,794 --> 00:24:14,921
Hang on, Sophie.

394
00:24:15,255 --> 00:24:16,840
I can't be here.

395
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,134
The last time I saw your mother,

396
00:24:19,217 --> 00:24:21,094
she said she never wanted to see me again.

397
00:24:21,177 --> 00:24:25,265
That was years ago.
Please, it would mean a lot to me.

398
00:24:25,348 --> 00:24:27,517
- Why?
Listen, I can see that you've been

399
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,685
to a great deal of trouble.

400
00:24:28,768 --> 00:24:31,187
Might I suggest that we all reconvene
on your boat?

401
00:24:31,271 --> 00:24:32,689
- Good idea.
- Nope.

402
00:24:33,314 --> 00:24:35,483
- Why?
- It's an adventure, Harry.

403
00:24:35,567 --> 00:24:37,318
- It's good for you.
- Oh, I see.

404
00:24:37,569 --> 00:24:40,572
Okay, when I sent the invites,
it was a long shot that you'd even reply.

405
00:24:40,655 --> 00:24:43,700
And now you've come all this way
for a wedding.

406
00:24:44,075 --> 00:24:48,121
Surely there must have been
some special reason for you to be here.

407
00:24:49,122 --> 00:24:52,333
Like some siren call, maybe?

408
00:24:53,543 --> 00:24:58,048
You're a little minx, you know that?
You're just like your mother.

409
00:24:58,131 --> 00:25:00,675
I'm glad my boys haven't met you.
They'd never recover.

410
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:02,719
- You have sons?
- Yes, two.

411
00:25:03,803 --> 00:25:06,056
And someday, I'd like to bring them here.

412
00:25:06,139 --> 00:25:07,891
Like you used to bring my mother?

413
00:25:17,233 --> 00:25:18,777
- No.
- It's Donna.

414
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:21,571
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Listen, listen, she can't know.

415
00:25:21,654 --> 00:25:23,073
I'm going to go. Please stay.

416
00:25:23,156 --> 00:25:27,160
Promise me that you'll not tell anybody
that I invited you.

417
00:25:27,243 --> 00:25:28,745
Okay? Promise?

418
00:25:28,828 --> 00:25:31,039
- You got it, baby.
- It's a promise.

419
00:25:31,122 --> 00:25:33,750
- I might regret it, but okay.
- Okay.

420
00:25:40,215 --> 00:25:42,384
There wouldn't, by any chance,
happen to be a trouser press

421
00:25:42,467 --> 00:25:43,843
on the island, would there?

422
00:26:04,906 --> 00:26:06,616
Harry?

423
00:26:10,787 --> 00:26:11,830

I'd better be dreaming.
You'd better not be here.

465
00:28:47,193 --> 00:28:48,611
You want me to pinch you, Donna?

466
00:28:48,695 --> 00:28:53,575
No! You keep your hands to yourself,
Bill Anderson.

467
00:28:54,784 --> 00:28:57,162
You probably don't recognise me, do you?

468
00:28:58,329 --> 00:29:00,957
Harry! It is you!

469
00:29:01,958 --> 00:29:04,794
I probably changed a bit,
but you certainly haven't.

470
00:29:06,588 --> 00:29:09,632
Why are you here?
What are you doing here?

471
00:29:09,716 --> 00:29:11,342
I'm writing a travel piece.

472
00:29:11,426 --> 00:29:13,386
I'm here on
a spontaneous holiday.

473
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,474
I just dropped in to say hi.

474
00:29:18,016 --> 00:29:20,351
Okay. What is this?

475
00:29:20,435 --> 00:29:24,314
It's one of those serendipitous moments
in life when three complete strangers

476
00:29:24,397 --> 00:29:26,316
share a common thought.

477
00:29:27,692 --> 00:29:28,985
Strangers?

478
00:29:29,861 --> 00:29:33,656
- You don't know each other?
- That's generally the definition.

479
00:29:33,865 --> 00:29:36,826
Okay, good, but who... Why are you here?

480
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:39,204
Who said that you could
stay up in my old goat-house?

481
00:29:39,287 --> 00:29:40,830
Didn't catch the name.
- Greek lady.

482
00:29:40,914 --> 00:29:42,665
- Well, she spoke Greek.
- Yeah.

483
00:29:42,749 --> 00:29:44,918
Or maybe she said we couldn't
stay in the old goat-house.

484
00:29:45,001 --> 00:29:47,003
- Yeah, maybe that was it, in Greek.
- There you go.

485
00:29:47,087 --> 00:29:49,672
Yeah, that's it, that's it.
You can't stay here because

486
00:29:49,756 --> 00:29:52,717
I'm closed and I'm full.

487
00:29:52,801 --> 00:29:56,638
And I'm busy, I'm really...
I have a wedding, my...

488
00:29:56,721 --> 00:29:58,139
Local girl's getting married...

489
00:29:58,223 --> 00:29:59,516
Donna. Donna, don't worry about us.

490
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:01,059
Bill here is used to roughing it.

491
00:30:01,142 --> 00:30:03,686
- And Harry here...
- I'm spontaneous.

492
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:05,146
Spontaneous.

493
00:30:07,357 --> 00:30:09,067
What about you?

494
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:11,361
Just wanted to see the island.

495
00:30:11,861 --> 00:30:14,072
You know what it meant to me.

496
00:30:16,241 --> 00:30:19,452
Okay, I'm gonna arrange for a boat

497
00:30:19,536 --> 00:30:23,039
to take you all back to the mainland.

498
00:30:23,123 --> 00:30:25,125
- I have a boat, Donna.
- You have a boat?

499
00:30:25,208 --> 00:30:26,543
Good, get on it,

500
00:30:26,626 --> 00:30:27,836
and anchors away.

501
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,921
- Hey, Donna...
- Away, away.

502
00:30:30,547 --> 00:30:32,340
It's good to see you.

503
00:30:39,723 --> 00:30:42,726
Now, baby, this should
tickle your taste buds.

504
00:30:42,809 --> 00:30:46,020
Down, big fella.
I'm old enough to be your mother.

505
00:30:46,312 --> 00:30:47,731
Grandmother.

506
00:30:48,273 --> 00:30:49,357
Where's Sophie?

507
00:30:49,482 --> 00:30:52,569
- I think she went down to the beach.
- What's up?

508
00:31:01,578 --> 00:31:02,787
Donna?

509
00:31:06,124 --> 00:31:08,251
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

Sophie's dad.

546
00:34:01,591 --> 00:34:04,594
Remember how I said it was Sam?
Sam the architect,

547
00:34:04,677 --> 00:34:06,262
who had to go home to get married?

548
00:34:06,346 --> 00:34:09,641
I'm not sure that it was him,

549
00:34:09,724 --> 00:34:14,312
because there were two other guys
around the same time.

550
00:34:15,563 --> 00:34:18,733
Donna Sheridan. You shady lady.

551
00:34:18,817 --> 00:34:20,193
Why didn't you tell us?

552
00:34:20,276 --> 00:34:23,863
Well, I never knew that
I would ever, ever have to.

553
00:34:23,947 --> 00:34:27,075
I never imagined I'd see all three of them

554
00:34:27,158 --> 00:34:28,785
in my old goat-house

555
00:34:28,868 --> 00:34:31,454
the day before my daughter's wedding!

556
00:34:31,788 --> 00:34:34,416
- The old goat-house?
- The old goat-house?

557
00:34:37,043 --> 00:34:39,963
No! No! Wait!

558
00:34:40,588 --> 00:34:41,631
Shoot!

559
00:34:42,465 --> 00:34:45,135
Rosie! Tanya!

560
00:34:45,468 --> 00:34:47,804
Wait a minute! Don't let them hear you!

561
00:34:49,514 --> 00:34:51,850
- There's no one here.
- Are you sure?

562
00:34:51,933 --> 00:34:53,393
Of course I'm sure!

563
00:34:53,476 --> 00:34:56,062
Do you think
I would forget my daughter's dads?

564
00:34:56,146 --> 00:34:59,065
They were all here. Sam Carmichael,

565
00:34:59,149 --> 00:35:02,152
Bill Anderson and Harry "Head Banger."

566
00:35:02,235 --> 00:35:03,528
Harry "Head Banger."

567
00:35:03,611 --> 00:35:05,363
They must've gone
back to their boat.

568
00:35:05,447 --> 00:35:08,116
I hope they run aground and drown.

569
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:09,909
What are they doing here?

570
00:35:09,993 --> 00:35:11,661
It's like some hideous trick of fate.

571
00:35:22,672 --> 00:35:24,382
It's very Greek.

572
00:35:26,509 --> 00:35:30,263
- Do they know about Sophie?
- What are they, psychic?

573
00:35:30,346 --> 00:35:32,515
No! I've never told a soul.

574
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:36,061
Oh, Donna,
keeping it to yourself all these years.

575
00:35:36,144 --> 00:35:38,396
It doesn't matter about me.

576
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:44,027
The only thing that matters
is that Sophie never finds out.

577
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:46,362
Well, maybe she would be cool with it.

578
00:35:46,446 --> 00:35:47,989
"Cool with it"?

579
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:53,370
You don't know my daughter.
This would be like a bombshell.

580
00:35:53,453 --> 00:35:55,121
Donna, they've gone!

581
00:35:55,205 --> 00:35:56,998
I don't know that.

582
00:35:57,082 --> 00:36:00,877
I don't know where they are.
I don't know why they're here.

583
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,171
And I have brought this all on myself

584
00:36:03,254 --> 00:36:06,383
because I was a stupid, reckless little slut!

585
00:36:08,968 --> 00:36:11,388
Don't you sound like your mother?

586
00:36:12,055 --> 00:36:14,474
- I do not!
- Yes, you so do!

587
00:36:14,557 --> 00:36:17,477
- Oh, my God, I do not.
- You do, it's Catholic guilt!

588
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,187
You've been living like a nun.

589
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:21,689

You promised you'd come to my wedding.

Yes, well, your mother ejected us
from the goat-house.

- No.

00:41:01,219 --> 00:41:04,431
She's just not even thinking straight.
She's so stressed about the wedding.

You know, but she's got no idea
that you're her lovely surprise.

- Sofia, that I'm named after.
- My great-aunt Sofia?

868
00:54:56,012 --> 00:54:57,263
I guess.

869
00:54:58,056 --> 00:55:01,017
I always heard her money was left to family.

870
00:55:08,191 --> 00:55:10,360
- How old are you?
- I'm 20.

871
00:55:14,072 --> 00:55:16,241
Will you excuse me a minute?

872
00:55:19,536 --> 00:55:20,829
I'm sorry.

873
00:55:24,249 --> 00:55:25,375
Bill!

874
00:55:27,085 --> 00:55:28,461
Bill, wait.

875
00:55:29,379 --> 00:55:31,840
Why did your great-aunt
leave my mother money?

876
00:55:31,923 --> 00:55:33,425
I don't know!

877
00:55:33,508 --> 00:55:36,136
All my life, there's been
this huge unanswered question,

878
00:55:36,219 --> 00:55:38,638
and I don't want any more secrecy!

879
00:55:38,722 --> 00:55:41,683
What do you want from me?
- Bill, please!

880
00:55:46,104 --> 00:55:47,814
Are you my father?

881
00:55:48,606 --> 00:55:51,151
Yes. I think so.

882
00:55:53,945 --> 00:55:54,988
Yes.

883
00:55:56,406 --> 00:55:58,116
You know what comes next?

884
00:55:58,324 --> 00:56:02,620
Oh, you're not going to tell me
that you have a twin sister, are you?

885
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:06,041
Will you give me away tomorrow?

886
00:56:06,458 --> 00:56:09,627
- Give you away?
- No! Our secret until the wedding.

887
00:56:12,714 --> 00:56:13,923
Cute.

888
00:56:18,803 --> 00:56:20,013
Oh, God.

889
00:56:23,308 --> 00:56:24,434

I'm your...

00:59:19,484 --> 00:59:21,277
Who's giving you...

945
00:59:24,114 --> 00:59:26,199
Stand back, everybody.
- Give her some space.

00:59:26,282 --> 00:59:27,826
Soph...
Baby!

947
00:59:32,789 --> 00:59:35,834
Come on, Mother, rise and shine.

948
00:59:35,917 --> 00:59:37,419
I was tossing and turning all night.

949
00:59:38,670 --> 00:59:41,840
Those three guys are still loose
on this island.

950
00:59:41,923 --> 00:59:43,007
We got to do something.

951
00:59:43,091 --> 00:59:46,386
Donna! Donna! Donna! Donna.
It's all under control.

952
00:59:46,678 --> 00:59:50,432
I have been tossing and turning all night.
I've got three dads coming to my wedding,

953
00:59:50,515 --> 00:59:53,101
and I have to tell two of them
they're surplus. Only, which two?

954
00:59:53,184 --> 00:59:54,519
It's all under control.

955
00:59:54,602 --> 00:59:56,521
I'm taking Bill and Sam fishing...

956
00:59:56,604 --> 00:59:58,815
We're each gonna go off.
We're gonna grab a man,

957
00:59:58,898 --> 01:00:01,234
interrogate him, swap notes and decide.

958
01:00:01,317 --> 01:00:03,945
And Harry's talked Tanya into water sports.

959
01:00:05,363 --> 01:00:08,366
Oh, God.
Nurse, donkey testicles, quickly!

960
01:00:32,098 --> 01:00:34,726
- No, after you. Please.
- No. No. Go ahead.

961
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:37,103
No, no, no, no, you first.

962
01:00:38,396 --> 01:00:41,441
- I want to get something off my chest.
- Me, too.

963
01:00:49,032 --> 01:00:51,993
Last night,
I discovered something wonderful.

964
01:00:52,577 --> 01:00:55,914
It was a wake-up call,
a way to look at myself and

965
01:00:56,206 --> 01:00:58,541
what I really want out of life.

966
01:01:00,502 --> 01:01:03,797
Last night? You didn't know?

967
01:01:05,382 --> 01:01:08,051
You didn't even suspect that you were...

968
01:01:08,134 --> 01:01:11,513
Well, no. Of course not.
That's always been a secret.

969
01:01:14,057 --> 01:01:16,434
And now we... Say it out loud.

970
01:01:16,518 --> 01:01:19,938
No! No! No! It's absolutely hush-hush.
I mean, for now.

971
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,732
All will be revealed tonight.

972
01:01:23,441 --> 01:01:26,277
Talking of revelations, last night...

973
01:01:28,029 --> 01:01:31,616
You and the little lady?
I think I know what's going on.

974
01:01:33,368 --> 01:01:35,245
- No, you don't. You don't.
- It's obvious.

975
01:01:35,328 --> 01:01:38,415
I saw it from the moment
you clapped eyes on each other.

976
01:01:39,332 --> 01:01:40,792
You're kidding.

977
01:01:42,293 --> 01:01:44,337
I'm gonna level with you, Harry.

978
01:01:44,546 --> 01:01:46,715
I don't think I can do this.

979
01:01:47,006 --> 01:01:49,175
Well, she's a wonderful girl,

980
01:01:49,884 --> 01:01:52,345
but can I take her on in my life?

981
01:01:52,595 --> 01:01:55,306
Bill, where's your spontaneity?

982
01:01:56,015 --> 01:01:57,726
It's this...

983
01:01:58,685 --> 01:02:02,564
- This family, you know?
- You don't have to marry her.

984
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:04,482
What?

985
01:02:06,109 --> 01:02:09,154
Hey, right in time for breakfast.

986
01:02:09,237 --> 01:02:12,032
We're serving up the works here.

987
01:02:12,115 --> 01:02:15,493
- Think you just did.
Sunny-side up! Lox or ham?

988
01:02:15,827 --> 01:02:17,287
I'll just...

989
01:02:19,831 --> 01:02:21,499
I'm just gonna...

990
01:02:24,544 --> 01:02:26,171
What a mess!

991
01:02:28,548 --> 01:02:30,258
- Hey!
- What?

992
01:02:31,384 --> 01:02:33,845
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.

993
01:02:33,928 --> 01:02:35,972
- Sophie.
- What?

994
01:02:38,058 --> 01:02:41,436
Last night, you and Sky... What's wrong?

995
01:02:43,688 --> 01:02:46,524
Tell me. Tell me what's wrong.

996
01:02:50,945 --> 01:02:54,032
- I don't know what to do.
- You know what to do.

997
01:02:57,744 --> 01:03:00,038
You don't have to do anything.

998
01:03:02,165 --> 01:03:06,086
Not too late, I can still call off the wedding.
Everybody will understand.

999
01:03:06,169 --> 01:03:08,380
Call... Call off the wedding?

1000
01:03:08,671 --> 01:03:10,799
- Isn't that what you want?
- No.

1001
01:03:11,549 --> 01:03:12,634
No.

1002
01:03:13,885 --> 01:03:15,887
No, that's what you want.

1003
01:03:16,388 --> 01:03:17,722
- No!
- Yes! God!

1004
01:03:17,806 --> 01:03:18,848
Sophie!

1005
01:03:18,932 --> 01:03:21,518
You just... You have no idea.

1006
01:03:21,601 --> 01:03:22,769
You never had a wedding.

1007
01:03:22,852 --> 01:03:24,687
You never did
the marriage-and-babies thing.

1008
01:03:24,771 --> 01:03:26,064
You just did the baby thing.

1009
01:03:26,147 --> 01:03:28,066
- Well, good for you.
- You know, I don't know why

1010
01:03:28,149 --> 01:03:31,820
- you're going off on me now! I really don't!
- Because I...

1011
01:03:32,529 --> 01:03:35,407
- God! I love Sky, and I want to be with him!
- Good! Great.

1012
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:39,786
And I don't want my children growing up
not knowing who their father is.

1013
01:03:39,869 --> 01:03:42,080
Because it's just... It's crap!

1014
01:03:42,455 --> 01:03:45,417
Voulez-vous

1015
01:03:46,626 --> 01:03:49,587
What are you doing?
- Stop, you're terrible.

1016
01:03:49,671 --> 01:03:51,589
Come on, man. What are you talking about?

1017
01:03:51,673 --> 01:03:55,802
Okay, okay, Sophie's gonna have
an absolutely beautiful wedding, right?

1018
01:03:56,428 --> 01:03:58,430
You're supposed to be helping me.

1019
01:03:58,513 --> 01:04:00,974
You guys... He's got to get ready.

1020
01:04:09,399 --> 01:04:11,651
I see you kept my bagpipes.

1021
01:04:14,487 --> 01:04:17,615
They're supposed to ward off
unwanted visitors.

1022
01:04:19,409 --> 01:04:22,245
Well, you don't need bagpipes to do that.

1023
01:04:23,288 --> 01:04:25,540
What are you doing here, Sam?

1024
01:04:25,832 --> 01:04:28,001
This is our dream, remember?

1025
01:04:29,335 --> 01:04:32,797
- Villa on the island?
- Yeah. Well, this is my reality.

1026
01:04:33,298 --> 01:04:36,301
Hard work and a crippling mortgage. Shoot!

1027
01:04:37,552 --> 01:04:41,014
And a hotel that's crumbling around me.

1028
01:04:41,097 --> 01:04:45,226
- Look, I'll help... Let me have a look at this...
- No, that's all right, I can

1029
01:04:45,310 --> 01:04:47,312
deal my own disasters.

1030
01:04:47,395 --> 01:04:50,565
Why didn't you tell me
it was Sophie getting married?

1031
01:04:50,648 --> 01:04:52,150
Well, I didn't think
it was any of your business.

1032
01:04:52,233 --> 01:04:54,319
Why is she getting married?
Settling down on the island?

1033
01:04:54,402 --> 01:04:57,489
I mean, if it was up to me,
I'd be telling her to go get a life.

1034
01:04:57,572 --> 01:04:59,324
- Yeah.
- She's a bright kid.

1035
01:04:59,407 --> 01:05:01,326
I know. I know.

1036
01:05:01,826 --> 01:05:04,579
But, you know, my daughter
has a mind of her own.

1037
01:05:04,913 --> 01:05:09,209
Oh, yeah. I see that. I see that.

1038
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:12,712
- But she's so young.
- I know.

1039
01:05:13,171 --> 01:05:15,173
I mean, does she know
what she really wants?

1040
01:05:15,256 --> 01:05:18,343
You see, I think part of her
just wants to let you know

1041
01:05:18,426 --> 01:05:22,013
that she isn't going to leave you
alone here, on your own.

1042
01:05:24,349 --> 01:05:26,559
- What do you mean?
- Donna, look.

1043
01:05:26,643 --> 01:05:30,230
I have two grown children.
I know something about letting go.

1044
01:05:30,522 --> 01:05:32,190
If Sophie felt you were okay on your own,

1045
01:05:32,273 --> 01:05:34,693
would she want something different
for herself?

1046
01:05:34,776 --> 01:05:36,861
Okay, here's the thing.

1047
01:05:36,945 --> 01:05:39,989
I love being on my own. I really do.

1048
01:05:40,073 --> 01:05:42,117
You know, every morning,
I get up and I thank God

1049
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:44,703
that I don't have some middle-aged,
menopausal man

1050
01:05:44,786 --> 01:05:46,413
telling me how to run my life.

1051
01:05:46,496 --> 01:05:49,207
You know, I'm free and I'm single.

1052

- Hello.

I just wanted to give you this.

1132

I don't mean here, here.

1133
01:12:03,123 --> 01:12:07,293
- I mean, why are you on this island?

What is this?

1135
01:12:10,004 --> 01:12:13,508
Now, I realised you'll have had to
tighten your belt a bit over the years,

1136
01:12:13,591 --> 01:12:15,635
bringing up Sophie on your own,

1137
01:12:15,719 --> 01:12:19,139
and I just wanted to make
a small contribution to the wedding.

1138
01:12:23,268 --> 01:12:26,479
- I can't accept this. I can't...
- No. No.

1139
01:12:26,855 --> 01:12:28,231
- Harry, I can't.
- No. No.

1140
01:12:28,314 --> 01:12:31,317
- Harry? I can't...
- No, you'll have to catch me first.

1141
01:12:32,861 --> 01:12:35,363
- Sky.
- What's the matter?

1142
01:12:35,572 --> 01:12:38,116
- You have to help me.
- Why, what's happened?

1143
01:12:38,658 --> 01:12:39,701
Baby?

1144
01:12:40,952 --> 01:12:42,162
Sophie!

1145
01:12:43,038 --> 01:12:44,164
Soph.

1146
01:12:46,041 --> 01:12:48,668
I've done something completely insane.

1147
01:12:49,377 --> 01:12:52,255
All my dads are here for our wedding,
and they all think they're giving me away.

1148
01:12:52,338 --> 01:12:53,840
All your what?

1149
01:12:55,258 --> 01:12:59,429
I read Mom's diary,
and I have three possible fathers.

1150
01:13:00,722 --> 01:13:02,849
But how are they here now?

1151
01:13:03,183 --> 01:13:04,768
I invited them.

1152
01:13:06,686 --> 01:13:08,605
I thought that I would know my dad
right away,

1153
01:13:08,688 --> 01:13:10,357
but I didn't. I just...

1154
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:13,026
I have no idea.
And now, my mom is gonna kill me,

1155
01:13:13,109 --> 01:13:15,445
- and they're gonna hate me, and you...
- Hold on. Hold on.

1156
01:13:15,528 --> 01:13:17,655
You invited these guys
and you didn't tell me?

1157
01:13:17,739 --> 01:13:20,450
No, I thought you would try to stop me.

1158
01:13:21,785 --> 01:13:23,995
- I know I messed up.
- Sophie?

1159
01:13:25,538 --> 01:13:27,999
Is that what this whole
big white wedding is about?

1160
01:13:28,083 --> 01:13:30,877
- You finding your dad?
- No. No!

1161
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:33,421
I wanted to take a boat to the mainland
with a couple of witnesses.

1162
01:13:33,505 --> 01:13:36,383
And you insisted on this sodding circus
so you could play Happy Families.

1163
01:13:36,466 --> 01:13:39,803
It's about knowing who I am. And I wanted
to get married knowing who I am.

1164
01:13:39,886 --> 01:13:42,764
That doesn't come from finding your father,

1165
01:13:43,139 --> 01:13:45,558
that comes from finding yourself.

1166
01:13:46,810 --> 01:13:50,063
And the irony is,
I was travelling to find myself.

1167
01:13:51,439 --> 01:13:53,900
I put everything on hold for you.

1168
01:13:56,236 --> 01:13:58,738
Because I loved you
and I wanted what you wanted.

1169
01:13:58,822 --> 01:14:00,240
Now, I don't know.

1170
01:14:00,907 --> 01:14:02,158
You don't know if you love me?

1171
01:14:02,242 --> 01:14:05,328
Of course I love you.
I just wish you'd told me.

1172
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:08,832
Is everything okay?

1173
01:14:09,749 --> 01:14:11,793
- Sophie, what's wrong?
- Not now, Sam.

1174
01:14:11,876 --> 01:14:13,461
Yes, yes, yes, now.

1175
01:14:13,545 --> 01:14:15,630
Because I'm supposed to be
giving you away.

1176
01:14:15,714 --> 01:14:17,799
And how can I when I know
you're not really gonna be happy?

1177
01:14:17,882 --> 01:14:21,052
I've heard all this from my mother, and
I think she knows me better than you do.

1178
01:14:21,136 --> 01:14:23,972
I know. But I've done the big white wedding,
and believe me,

1179
01:14:24,055 --> 01:14:27,767
- it doesn't always end in "happy ever after."
- That is you. That's not me.

1180
01:14:27,851 --> 01:14:30,645
Okay? I love Sky more than anything
in the world. And I...

1181
01:14:31,896 --> 01:14:34,816
Did you feel that way
before you got married?

1182
01:14:36,651 --> 01:14:37,736
No.

1183
01:14:54,377 --> 01:14:57,714
Hey, aren't you supposed to be
getting dressed?

1184
01:14:57,797 --> 01:15:00,925
Where's Ali and Lisa?
I thought they were going to help you.

1185
01:15:01,009 --> 01:15:02,635
Will you help me?

1186
01:15:07,182 --> 01:15:11,102
Wait. It's okay, it's okay.

1187
01:15:11,269 --> 01:15:12,979

I don't know.

01:27:32,218 --> 01:27:35,805
I don't care if you slept with
hundreds of men.

1339
01:27:37,390 --> 01:27:40,727
You're my mom, and I love you so much.

1340
01:27:42,729 --> 01:27:44,397
Oh, Soph.

1341
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:50,612
And I haven't slept with hundreds of men.

1342
01:27:54,407 --> 01:27:57,535
Am I getting this right?

1343
01:27:57,619 --> 01:28:02,665
Sophie may be mine,
but she may be Bill's or Harry's?

1344
01:28:02,749 --> 01:28:06,419
Yeah, yeah. That's right.
And don't get all self-righteous with me,

1345
01:28:06,503 --> 01:28:09,214
because you have
no one but yourself to blame.

1346
01:28:09,297 --> 01:28:13,468
Yeah, if you hadn't just dumped my mother
and gone off and married somebody else...

1347
01:28:13,551 --> 01:28:18,139
Hey, hey, wait a minute!
I had to go home. I was engaged.

1348
01:28:18,223 --> 01:28:21,601
But I told Lorraine I couldn't marry her,
and I came right back.

1349
01:28:25,146 --> 01:28:27,190
You... You...

1350
01:28:28,608 --> 01:28:30,860
- Why didn't you call me?
- Because I was crazy enough

1351
01:28:30,944 --> 01:28:32,529
to think that you would be waiting for me.

1352
01:28:32,612 --> 01:28:36,199
Only when I arrived, they told me
you were off with some other guy.

1353
01:28:38,868 --> 01:28:43,248
So, Lorraine called me an idiot
and married me to prove it.

1354
01:28:43,373 --> 01:28:45,417
Sorry, can I just... Might I just butt in?

1355
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:47,460
Oh, Harry, don't... It's all right.
You don't have to.

1356
01:28:47,544 --> 01:28:52,382
No, no, I just wanted to say it's great
to have even a third of Sophie.

1357
01:28:52,465 --> 01:28:55,635
I never thought I'd get
even that much of a child.

1358
01:28:55,844 --> 01:28:58,805
Donna, you were the first girl I ever loved.

1359
01:28:59,723 --> 01:29:03,018
Well, actually, you were
the last girl I ever loved.

1360
01:29:04,561 --> 01:29:07,814
Now, this gives me an excuse
to come here much more often.

1361
01:29:07,897 --> 01:29:10,900
We can find out if you want,

1362
01:29:11,234 --> 01:29:13,153
but I'm with Harry.

1363
01:29:14,070 --> 01:29:17,866
- Being a third of your dad is great by me.
By me, too.

1364
01:29:17,949 --> 01:29:19,367
I'll take a third.

1365
01:29:19,451 --> 01:29:23,997
Typical, isn't it? You wait 20 years for a dad,
and then three come along at once.

1366
01:29:27,834 --> 01:29:29,002
Dearly beloved...

1367
01:29:29,085 --> 01:29:34,966
You know, I have no clue which one of you
