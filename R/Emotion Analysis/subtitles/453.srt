1
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:18,429
The Ring of the Fisherman,
which bears the official papal seal...

2
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:22,600
...must be destroyed immediately
following the pope's death.

3
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:27,480
The papal apartment is then sealed
for nine days of mourning...

4
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:30,274
...a period known as sede vacante:

5
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:33,027
The time of the empty throne.

6
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:36,823
Over the last several days...

7
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,992
...Catholic leaders from every corner
of the world...

8
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,079
...have flocked to Rome,
shocked by the sudden death...

9
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:47,291
...of this progressive
and beloved pope.

10
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:56,509
Today, in St. Peter's Square...

11
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:59,095
...the faithful pray
that there is among them...

12
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:01,806
...another leader
who can unite their Church...

13
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:05,935
...which has been so riven by change
and dissent in recent years.

14
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:12,859
As the body of the pontiff
passes by...

15
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,320
...we see prayers are being offered
by the preferiti...

16
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:18,698
...favorites among those
being considered...

17
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:22,785
...to succeed him
as the Vicar of Christ.

18
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:35,172
At the end of the mourning period,
the College of Cardinals...

19
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,802
...will lock itself behind the doors
of the Sistine Chapel for conclave...

20
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,222
...the process by which they
will choose a new leader...

21
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,017
...for the world's
one billion Catholics...

22
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:48,978
...who now find their Church
at a crossroads...

23
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:53,065
...its ancient traditions threatened
by a modern world.

24
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:04,785
Attention, control group going online
for LHC beam event.

25
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,163
We are powering up.

26
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,252
Attention, Category One personnel:

27
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,839
Interlock areas are now restricted.

28
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:46,577
ATLAS underground
is now in restricted mode.

29
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:50,039
Protons are being loaded.

30
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:57,338
Powering on LHC magnets.

31
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,218
Ion source stage
in four, three, two....

32
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:04,095
We are powering up. Here we go.

33
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,138
Start the collision sequence.

34
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:21,988
Beam-on-beam stability is good.
Take your places, people.

35
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,031
ATLAS at CMS, check.

36
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,580
We have got 10 to the 13th protons
per bunch.

37
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,251
Let's hope the heavy ion guys
didn't mess up.

38
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:38,421
Beams at relativistic velocities.

39
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,049
Luminosity monitors operational.

40
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:44,427
Beamline has no restrictions.

41
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,387
Enable beam capture.

42
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,764
Accelerating the beam.

43
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,766
Stage one, line up.

44
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,560
Magnets to full field.

45
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:54,353
Load functions to magnets.

46
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,439
Last P is still too high.

47
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,692
Yeah, we got luminosity of 10 to 34.

48
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:02,570
Inject particle beams.

49
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,448
Filling the LHC.

50
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:15,583
Particles in transition.

51
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:22,131
Collisions are fixed and running.

52
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:25,551
LHC injecting protons, beam one.

53
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:29,805
Lock the feedback systems.

54
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:33,642
Particles at 99 percent
the speed of light.

55
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,853
Colliding stable beams.

56
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,522
Enact injection kicker.

57
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:43,861
We have a signal
on the luminosity monitors.

58
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:46,155
We have events.

59
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:53,537
Protons are moving.

60
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,779
That's a crate of beer on the way.

61
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,036
A swim might help your jet lag.

62
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,871
I beg your pardon?

63
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,000
You got bags under your eyes.
It's 5 in the morning.

64
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,960
And you're from the Vatican.

65
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:31,296
Crossed keys under the triregnum.

66
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:33,799
It's a papal symbol.

67
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:40,472
Claudio Vincenzi,
Corpo della Gendarmeria Vaticano.

68
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,017
Vatican police?

69
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,395
I was expecting another letter.

70
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,650
My request for access
to your archives.

71
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,986
Shouldn't you be in Rome?

72
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,196
A kind of busy time for you guys,
isn't it?

73
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:59,491
In fact, I was in New York,
detailed to the U.N.

74
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,910
I receive a phone call
in the middle of the night:

75
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,580
"Find Professor Robert Langdon.

76
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:07,416
A matter of great urgency."

77
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:11,670
They said to show you this.

78
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,935
The Illuminati? They disappeared
hundreds of years ago.

79
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,771
Did they? Look at that again.

80
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,022
It's an ambigram.

81
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,274
It's the same image
forward and backward.

82
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:35,611
Now, that's common for a symbol,
like a yin and yang or a swastika...

83
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:37,029
...but that's a word.

84
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,114
That Illuminati
ambigramatic symbol...

85
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:42,117
...has been considered a myth
for 400 years.

86
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,911
Supposedly, in the 16th century...

87
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,082
...some artist created it as a tribute
to Galileo's love of symmetry.

88
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,708
It was only gonna be revealed...

89
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,127
...when the Illuminati
had amassed enough power...

90
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,463
...to resurface and carry out
their final goal.

91
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:55,923
I wrote a book about it.

92
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,467
Which is why you're here.

93
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,803
The Art of the Illuminati
by Robert Langdon.

94
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,304
Part One.

95
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:05,432
Haven't been able to finish Part Two.
I'm not allowed access...

96
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,309
...to your archives.

97
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:15,150
It's remarkable. Singular.

98
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,152
Someone is trying
to make you believe...

99
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,655
...the Illuminati themselves
have returned to Rome.

100
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:22,199
Right after the death of a pope.

101
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:28,705
Four cardinals were kidnapped
from inside the Vatican...

102
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,792
...sometime between
3 and 5 a.m. this morning.

103
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,669
Shortly afterward...

104
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:36,755
...that document was sent
to the Office of the Swiss Guard...

105
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:40,551
...along with the threat the cardinals
will be publicly executed...

106
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:44,388
...one per hour, beginning at 8 p.m.
tonight in Rome.

107
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,359
-Conclave.
-Was to begin today.

108
00:12:57,527 --> 00:13:00,863
We've postponed its start
for a few hours, a story of illness.

109
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,240
There are no suspicions yet.

110
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:05,868
What do you want from me?

111
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:10,372
These criminals
who sent this ambigram...

112
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,375
...meant it as a taunt, a provocation.

113
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:17,212
But Captain Olivetti think if you can
use it to learn their identity...

114
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,465
...perhaps we can stop
this abomination.

115
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:25,929
Why me?

116
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,725
Your expertise. Your erudition.

117
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:34,563
Your recent involvement
with certain Church, shall we say...

118
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,440
...mysteries.

119
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,401
I wasn't under the impression
that episode...

120
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,570
...had endeared me to the Vatican.

121
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:42,946
Oh, it didn't.

122
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:46,074
But it did make you--
What's the word?

123
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,035
--formidabile.

124
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,120
Formidable.

125
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:54,249
A Vatican jet is standing by
20 minutes from here.

126
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:55,584
Will you come with me?

127
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:06,136
Professore Langdon,
you've spent your life...

128
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:09,514
...searching for symbols like the one
you now hold in your hand.

129
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,975
How much longer are we
going to pretend...

130
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:14,478
...you have not already
decided to come?

131
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:24,321
If the Illuminati have returned
and are in Rome...

132
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:27,616
...we will hunt them down
and kill them.

133
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,702
The Illuminati
did not become violent...

134
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,997
...until the 17th century. Their name
means "the enlightened ones."

135
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:37,167
They were physicists
and mathematicians, astronomers.

136
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:40,212
They were concerned with
the Church's inaccurate teaching...

137
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,339
...and were dedicated
to scientific truth.

138
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,049
But the Vatican didn't like that.

139
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,218
So the Church began to--
How did you say it?

140
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,429
Oh, "hunt them down and kill them."

141
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,181
Drove them underground.

142
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,768
Into a secret society.

143
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,205
Excuse me.

144
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:07,591
Comandante Richter assures me
the guard...

145
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,178
...is doing everything humanly possible
to find the prefefiti.

146
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:14,264
A long way to say very little.

147
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,018
What if you were to begin
in their absence?

148
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:19,936
They are the four leading candidates.

149
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,272
If they're not present,
they're not eligible.

150
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,736
There will be no consensus without
them. Who are we to vote for?

151
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:34,951
It is as much a sin to offer flattery
as to accept it.

152
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,913
May I suggest you at least consider
the possibility.

153
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:39,748
No, no, no. There is no possibility.

154
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:44,586
I have been chosen Great Elector.
I am not eligible.

155
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,842
Camerlengo asks how long we can
postpone the opening prayer...

156
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,720
...without making another
announcement to the public.

157
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:58,433
Tell the camerlengo the cardinal-elect
will take every minute required...

158
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,853
...to perform the sacred trust.

159
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:05,524
No further announcements
are necessary.

160
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:10,112
He'll be concerned
about the public dimension.

161
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,907
-People will think--
-What we tell them to think.

162
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,579
-Professor Langdon.
-Yes.

163
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,623
Welcome to Vatican City.

164
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,794
Ernesto Olivetti, inspector general
of the Vatican police force.

165
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,963
-My pleasure.
-This way, please.

166
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:30,799
We'll meet in the headquarters
of the Swiss Guard.

167
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,135
I thought you were Swiss Guard.

168
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,970
No, la Gendarmeria.

169
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:38,723
We are responsible for everything
inside the Vatican walls...

170
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:42,310
...with the exception
of the security of His Holiness...

171
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,104
-Yeah.
-...and the Apostolic Palace.

172
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:45,814
That is Swiss Guard.

173
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,693
The Roman carabinieri are here
as well in an advisory capacity.

174
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:51,528
So jurisdictionally, this is....

175
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,572
A goddamn nightmare.

176
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,415
Oh, yes, Pope Pius IX's
great castration.

177
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,543
-l beg your pardon?
-1857, Pope Pius IX...

178
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:10,255
...felt the male form
would inspire lust.

179
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:11,923
So he took a hammer and chisel...

180
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,759
...and unmanned hundreds
of these statues.

181
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,847
The plaster fig leaves
were added later.

182
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,519
Are you anti-Catholic,
Professor Langdon?

183
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:28,106
No. I'm anti-vandalism.

184
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:34,237
I urge you to guard your tone here.

185
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:38,491
The Swiss Guard is a calling,
not a profession...

186
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:43,455
...and it encourages
a certain zealotry.

187
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,582
Commander Richter,
the head of the Guard...

188
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,417
...is a deeply spiritual man...

189
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:50,128
...and he was close
to the late pope. Understood?

190
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:53,423
Look, I don't study symbols
because I consider them unimportant.

191
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:55,926
Ceremony, traditions,
it's how we mark our lives.

192
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,969
I just-- I just hope I can help.

193
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,763
So do l.

194
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:02,349
You were my idea.

195
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,154
Wait here. Please.

196
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:19,824
Commander?

197
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,326
Commander Richter?

198
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:23,870
Professor Langdon is here.

199
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:26,831
Well, we have bigger problems
than that now.

200
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,419
Dr. Vetra?

201
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,340
I'm Commander Richter, comandante
principale of the Swiss Guard.

202
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,800
Thank you for coming.

203
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:38,510
Hello.

204
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:41,012
-Professor Langdon.
-Yes.

205
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,682
What a relief,
the symbologist is here.

206
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,850
This way, please, Miss Vetra.

207
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,604
The situation has changed.

208
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:53,066
We received another threat
from the kidnapper.

209
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:56,027
The canister was stolen from our lab
around noon yesterday.

210
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,739
The intruder killed my research
partner, Silvano Bentivoglio...

211
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:03,201
...and mutilated him
in order to bypass security.

212
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,161
We use retinal scanners.

213
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:07,831
They cut out his eye.

214
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,376
Is that your stolen canister,
Miss Vetra?

215
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,170
Where is that camera, Number 86?

216
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,964
It's wireless. It too was stolen.

217
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:17,966
It could be anywhere
inside the Vatican.

218
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:21,219
That canister contains
an extremely combustible substance.

219
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:24,264
We need to locate it immediately
or evacuate Vatican City.

220
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:26,933
I'm quite familiar
with incendiaries, Miss Vetra.

221
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:29,394
I've never heard of antimatter
being used as such.

222
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:32,564
Well, it's never been generated
in significant quantities before.

223
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:35,442
It's a way of studying the origins
of the universe...

224
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,486
...to try to isolate what some people
call "the God particle."

225
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,864
But there are implications
for energy research--

226
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:42,907
"The God particle"?

227
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,744
What we call it isn't important.

228
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,579
It's what gives all matter mass.

229
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,706
The thing without which
we could not exist.

230
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:52,584
You're talking about
the moment of creation.

231
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,377
Yes. In a way, I am.

232
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:57,505
The antimatter is suspended there...

233
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:01,259
...in an airtight nanocomposite shell
with electromagnets in each end.

234
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:04,721
If it were to fall out of suspension
and come in contact with matter...

235
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:07,766
...say, the bottom of the canister,
the two opposing forces...

236
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,018
...would annihilate one another
violently.

237
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:12,479
And what might cause it
to fall out of suspension?

238
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,064
The battery going dead.

239
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:17,567
-Which it will, just before midnight.
-What kind of annihilation?

240
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:20,445
-How violent?
-A cataclysmic event.

241
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:25,116
A blinding explosion equivalent
to about five kilotons.

242
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:29,287
Vatican City
will be consumed by light.

243
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,750
Those are the exact words
the kidnapper used.

244
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:37,337
We will destroy your four pillars.

245
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,173
We will brand your preferiti...

246
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:43,676
...and sacrifice them
on the altars of science...

247
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,805
...then bring your church down
upon you.

248
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:50,475
Vatican City
will be consumed by light.

249
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:54,813
A shining star at the end
of the Path of Illumination.

250
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,362
It's the ancient Illuminati threat.

251
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,323
Destruction of Vatican City
through light.

252
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:09,202
Four pillars,
there's your kidnapped cardinals.

253
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:12,205
You didn't tell me they
were the prefefiti, the favorites...

254
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:14,165
...to be named the next pope.

255
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:18,545
Play it again.

256
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,762
We will destroy your four pillars.

257
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,141
We will brand your preferiti--

258
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,518
Wait, stop it. Stop it.

259
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,980
"Brand" them.

260
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:41,151
That's another Illuminati legend.

261
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:46,698
This one says
that there are a set of five brands...

262
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,074
...each one an ambigram.

263
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:50,785
The first four are the fundamental
elements of science:

264
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:53,037
Earth, air, fire and water.

265
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,707
The fifth, it's a mystery.

266
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,878
Maybe it's this.

267
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,172
He said they'd be killed publicly.

268
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:03,882
Yes.

269
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:06,885
Revenge for la purga.

270
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:08,678
"La purga"?

271
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:13,683
Oh, jeez, you guys don't even read
your own history, do you?

272
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:18,855
1668, the Church kidnapped
four Illuminati scientists...

273
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:21,149
...and branded each one of them
on the chest...

274
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:23,234
...with the symbol of the cross...

275
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,987
...to purge them of their sins,
and they executed them.

276
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,406
Threw their bodies into the street
as a warning...

277
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:32,202
...to others to stop questioning
Church rulings on scientific matters.

278
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:33,411
They radicalized them.

279
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:36,539
The purga created a darker,
more violent Illuminati...

280
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:39,250
...one bent on retribution.

281
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,836
Look how they intend
to finally get it:

282
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:45,423
Using antimatter, technology,
to destroy the Church.

283
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,884
Science obliterates religion.

284
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:50,887
Is there any more?

285
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:55,808
--and sacrifice them
on the altars of science...

286
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:58,853
...then bring your church down
upon you.

287
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:02,482
Vatican City will be consumed
by light.

288
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:06,903
A shining star at the end
of the Path of Illumination.

289
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:09,197
"Path of Illumination."

290
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:14,536
I need access
to the Vatican archives.

291
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:19,082
Professor, I don't think
this is the appropriate--

292
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,125
Your petition has been denied
seven times.

293
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,796
No, no. This has nothing to do with
my work. The Path of Illumination...

294
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:27,799
...is a trail that leads
to the Church of the Illumination...

295
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:31,052
...the place where the Illuminati
would meet in secret.

296
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,471
If I can find the segno, the sign...

297
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:38,268
...that marks the beginning of that
path, the four churches along it...

298
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:41,187
...may be where he intends
to murder your cardinals.

299
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:44,148
One every hour at 8, 9, 10 and 11.

300
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,985
Then the device explodes
at midnight.

301
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:50,863
If we can figure out the first church
and get there before he does...

302
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:54,158
...maybe we can stop it.
But I can't find the start of the path...

303
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,244
...until I get into the archives.

304
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,913
Even if I wanted to help you...

305
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:01,583
...access to the archives
is only by written decree...

306
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,627
...by the curator
and the Board of Vatican Librarians.

307
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:06,462
Or by papal mandate.

308
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:10,466
Yes, but as you no doubt have heard,
the Holy Father is dead.

309
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:12,594
What about il camerlengo?

310
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:16,097
The camerlengo is just a priest here,
the former pope's chamberlain.

311
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:20,268
Doesn't the power of the Holy See rest
in him during tempe sede vacante?

312
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:31,112
Fellas, you called me.

313
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,198
His Holiness once told me a pope...

314
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,994
...was a man torn between
the real world and the divine.

315
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:41,331
It seems the real world
is upon us tonight.

316
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:46,002
I'm familiar with Illuminati lore
and the legend of the brandings.

317
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,714
La purga is a dark stain
on this Church's history.

318
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:52,925
I'm not surprised this ghost
has returned to haunt us.

319
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:58,514
Comandante, have you begun
the search for this explosive device?

320
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,391
Of course, but it could be anywhere.

321
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,478
My primary concern at the moment
is the safety of the cardinals.

322
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:05,647
The Sistine Chapel is a fortress.

323
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,524
As long as the cardinals
are in conclave, your concerns...

324
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:11,235
...are at a minimum.
Devote as many of your resources--

325
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,613
If you're about to suggest
a naked-eye search...

326
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:17,158
...of the entire Vatican City, I will tell
you we do not have the people.

327
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:20,328
Though I am not His Holiness,
when you are addressing me...

328
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,914
...you are addressing this office.
Do you understand?

329
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:26,250
Yes, Father.

330
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,586
Good.

331
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:33,508
You said the image on the screen
was illuminated by artificial light.

332
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:35,802
Might I suggest
methodically cutting power...

333
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:38,096
...to various sections of the city.

334
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,848
When the image goes dark,
you'll have a specific idea...

335
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,101
...of the camera's location.

336
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:49,982
Dr. Vetra, besides yourself
and your research partner...

337
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,569
...who else knew
about this antimatter project?

338
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:58,366
No one but the research team.
This project was strictly confidential.

339
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:00,451
But Silvano kept detailed journals.

340
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:01,911
If he told anyone else...

341
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:05,039
...about what we were doing,
he would have made a note.

342
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:06,624
Do you have these journals?

343
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:09,335
I can have them flown here
from Geneva in an hour.

344
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:11,170
Please.

345
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:13,881
Professor Langdon.

346
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:30,690
Mr. Langdon, you are correct that I
may grant you access to the archives.

347
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:34,569
Thank you, Padre.

348
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:38,489
I said that you were correct
that I may, not that I will.

349
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,660
Christianity's most sacred codices
are in that archive.

350
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:47,582
Given your recent entanglement
with the Church...

351
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,084
...there is a question I'd like
to ask you first...

352
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:52,712
...in the office of His Holiness.

353
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,180
Do you believe in God, sir?

354
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:09,353
Father, I simply believe
that religion--

355
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:13,024
I did not ask if you believe
what man says about God.

356
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:15,026
I asked if you believe in God.

357
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:19,697
I'm an academic.

358
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:23,785
My mind tells me I will never...

359
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,495
...understand God.

360
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,122
And your heart?

361
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,252
Tells me I'm not meant to.

362
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,297
Faith is a gift...

363
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,716
...that I have yet to receive.

364
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:47,809
Be delicate with our treasures.

365
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:55,399
The archives are this way.

366
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,485
Professor Langdon.

367
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,739
If this path really leads
to the Church of Illumination...

368
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:04,242
...that may be where they've hidden
the antimatter.

369
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,202
"A shining star
at the end of the path."

370
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,411
Follow the path.

371
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,414
-We may find the canister.
-Can you deactivate the device?

372
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,916
I can change the batteries...

373
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:14,335
...as long as we have
more than five minutes.

374
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:17,755
That would give us another 24 hours
to get it safely back to CERN.

375
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:21,884
Robert Langdon.

376
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:23,719
Vittoria Vetra.

377
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:27,390
Are you really a symbologist,
or was he mocking you?

378
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:29,725
Well, both. You're a physicist?

379
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:33,104
Bio-entanglement physics.
Interconnectivity of life systems.

380
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:34,564
Okay.

381
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:37,775
Your project, it was geared
towards energy research?

382
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,110
Eventually, yes.

383
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:43,281
One speck of antimatter
could power an entire city for a month.

384
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:45,867
Or tonight, I guess, destroy one.

385
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:48,911
What are we looking for
in the archives?

386
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,788
A bound volume written by Galileo.

387
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,582
Galileo was Illuminati?

388
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:55,459
Yeah. And an obedient Catholic
who didn't think...

389
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,503
...that Church and science
were enemies...

390
00:29:57,671 --> 00:30:00,006
...but a different language
telling the same story.

391
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:02,842
He wanted like minds
to find the Church of Illumination...

392
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:08,264
...but he couldn't exactly advertise its
location so he created a coded path.

393
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:11,642
Richter has started to turn off
the power of various grids.

394
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,936
It'll be back on in a minute.

395
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:18,149
Then some unknown Illuminati master
sculpted four statues.

396
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:21,360
Each one a tribute to one
of the fundamental elements...

397
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,279
...earth, air, fire, water...

398
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:26,908
...and placed the statues out in public
in churches throughout Rome.

399
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,660
Each statue held a clue
pointing to the next.

400
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,330
At the end of the path
was the Church of Illumination.

401
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,458
If you could find that,
you were one of them.

402
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:38,377
What makes you think he's going
to murder in the churches?

403
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:40,880
The Illuminati called
those four churches...

404
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:44,884
...by the special name,
L'Altare della scienza.

405
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:48,012
"Sacrifice them on the altars
of science," he said.

406
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,847
Exactly.

407
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:55,937
Oh, wow. Look at this.

408
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,547
Excuse me, signore.

409
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:27,760
Cardinal Strauss,
you've been informed of the situation?

410
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:29,387
Yeah.

411
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:33,432
My belief is we should proceed
with the sealing of conclave.

412
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,395
At this late hour?
That would be highly unorthodox.

413
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:41,023
And yet within Church law.
It's in my power. I am Great Elector.

414
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:43,359
The cruelest honor in Christendom.

415
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:46,904
I have no personal ambitions,
Patrick.

416
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:50,908
Only those I hold for my Church,
St. Peter's Church...

417
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:53,911
...which is under attack
at its most vulnerable moment.

418
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,496
And this is not a coincidence.

419
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:59,083
The Church will not fall in a day.
We must evacuate Vatican City.

420
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:02,169
Oh, that is exactly what they want.

421
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,005
Publicity and panic.

422
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:07,174
No, we must not give them oxygen
for the media fire.

423
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:10,428
But the people
in St. Peter's Square--

424
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:14,765
Care deeply about their Church,
as we do.

425
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,351
Their faith will sustain them.

426
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,021
Their faith will not protect them
from an explosion.

427
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,731
Well....

428
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:26,402
We are all bound for heaven
eventually, are we not?

429
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:29,947
Spoken like one who has enjoyed
the blessings of a long and full life.

430
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:31,615
Patrick...

431
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:35,036
...do not confuse the power
of the office you temporarily hold...

432
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:38,122
...with your true place
here in the Vatican.

433
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,460
You were a favorite
of His Holiness...

434
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:46,464
...but His Holiness
is with his father now.

435
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,259
Mea culpa.

436
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,678
Seal the doors.

437
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:09,653
Extra Omnes.

438
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,859
Hello. This way, please.

439
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,570
Oh, beautiful.

440
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,201
The chambers are hermetic vaults.

441
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:41,579
Oxygen is kept
at lowest possible levels.

442
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,622
It's a partial vacuum inside.

443
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,292
So extended stays
are not recommended.

444
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:50,087
So don't panic if you feel
lightheaded at first.

445
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,851
I'll be just outside the door.

446
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,687
Watching you, Mr. Langdon.

447
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,956
By the way,
it's normal to feel a little light-headed.

448
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:31,045
Yeah. Feels like I'm scuba diving
with the wrong mixture.

449
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,047
Take a second. We have time.

450
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,759
Actually, I take that back.

451
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:40,721
-ls that Mickey Mouse?
-Yeah. It's a long story.

452
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:35,234
Conclave will go on without us.

453
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:39,321
It must, now of all times.

454
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:42,199
May God forgive you
for what you've done.

455
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,001
Father, if God has issues...

456
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:56,255
...they won't be with what I've done.

457
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:59,216
They will be
with what I'm about to do.

458
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,032
It was confiscated
from the Netherlands...

459
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:26,285
...by the Vatican
just after Galileo died.

460
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:28,912
I've been petitioning to see it
for about 10 years...

461
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,707
...ever since I realized
what was in it.

462
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,792
What makes you so sure
the segno's there?

463
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,335
The number 503.

464
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:39,506
I kept seeing it over and over again
in Illuminati letters...

465
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:43,469
...scribbled in the margins,
sometimes just signed "503."

466
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,304
It's a numeric clue. But to what?

467
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:48,390
Five? Well, that's a meaningful
number to the Illuminati.

468
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:51,852
There's the pentagram, Pythagoras,
dozens of other examples in science.

469
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,062
But what about three?

470
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:56,398
Didn't make sense until I thought,
"What if it's Roman numerals?"

471
00:37:56,566 --> 00:38:00,444
-DIII.
-D-three. Galileo's third text.

472
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:05,532
"Dialogo. Discorso. Diagramma."

473
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:12,456
Yeah.

474
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,003
Just a few days with this...

475
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:20,339
...and I could have
actually finished my book...

476
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:23,926
...and sold dozens of copies
at the Harvard bookstore.

477
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:26,678
"ll Diagramma Veritatis."

478
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,680
Diagram of Truth.

479
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,433
I know about Dialogo and Discorsi.

480
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:35,354
Galileo laid out his theories about
the Earth revolving around the sun.

481
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:38,440
Yeah, and said the Earth
was not the center of some universe...

482
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:41,235
...with heaven above, hell below,
as the Church had said.

483
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:44,780
So they forced him to recant in the
second book. But what was this one?

484
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:46,573
This is how he got the word out.

485
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:49,535
This is the truth, not what the Vatican
forced him to write.

486
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:53,288
Smuggled out of Rome, printed
in Holland on sedge papyrus, see?

487
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:56,834
That way any scientist caught with
a copy could just throw it in water...

488
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,628
...and Galileo's heresy
would dissolve, disappear.

489
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:03,215
And between that
and Vatican burnings...

490
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:06,552
...it's possible that
this is the only copy that remains.

491
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,720
And if I'm correct...

492
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:13,559
...the segno is hidden
on page number--

493
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,310
Five.

494
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,020
Yeah.

495
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:25,154
Do you need help with the Latin?

496
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,406
Sure.

497
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:39,751
Movement of the planets,
elliptical orbits, heliocentricity.

498
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:45,757
Sorry, I don't think there's anything
that could be interpreted as a--

499
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:47,259
Wait, wait, wait.

500
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:49,428
Do that again.

501
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,097
What is that?

502
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:58,228
Wait a minute, it's a watermark.
And there's a line of text.

503
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,564
Go back.

504
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:02,900
It's in English.

505
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:06,445
English? Why English?

506
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:09,489
English wasn't used in the Vatican.
It was too polluted.

507
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:12,201
It was free-thinking.
It was a language of radicals...

508
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:15,078
...like Shakespeare and Chaucer.

509
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:19,541
Here's another one. "The path of light
is laid, the sacred test--"

510
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:24,129
-Will you write this down as I dictate?
-Sorry, professor, no time.

511
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:31,845
Yeah, yeah, what the hell. Yeah.

512
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,487
Twenty minutes till 8.

513
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:50,489
-Where are we headed?
-Hold on, hold on.

514
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:53,659
I'll tell you in a minute.
Let me see that page again.

515
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,625
Where did you get that paper?

516
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:03,085
We borrowed it.

517
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:06,505
"From Santi's earthly tomb
with demon's hole."

518
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:07,798
Are you insane?

519
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:10,968
"'Cross Rome the mystic elements
unfold.

520
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:14,513
The path of light is laid,
the sacred test.

521
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:18,850
Let angels guide thee
on thy lofty quest."

522
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:22,604
You removed a document
from the Vatican Archives?

523
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:24,189
She did.

524
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:31,029
"From Santi's earthly tomb."

525
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:34,366
-The first marker is at Santi's tomb.
-Yeah.

526
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:36,785
-But who's Santi?
-Raphael.

527
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:39,705
-ll Raffaello, the sculptor?
-Yeah, Santi was his last name.

528
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:41,707
So the path starts
at Raphael's tomb.

529
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:43,959
Raphael's buried at the Pantheon.

530
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:47,296
-Isn't the Pantheon a church?
-Oldest Catholic church in Rome.

531
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:10,277
I just pulled a dozen of our best men
for this.

532
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:14,239
-You better be right.
-This is one of the busiest spots.

533
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:17,200
-He'd never get away with it.
-The poem implies--

534
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,411
"The poem"? Unbelievable.

535
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:20,871
I'm basing this operation...

536
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:24,583
...on an American's interpretation
of a 400-year-old poem.

537
00:42:24,751 --> 00:42:27,586
The information we have
clearly refers to Raphael's tomb.

538
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:29,504
Raphael's tomb
is inside that building.

539
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:33,759
Because the Vatican destroyed all of
the pagan statues in the late-1800s...

540
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:37,471
...if this is the marker, whatever clues
were here to lead us are gone now.

541
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:40,932
The path is dead. So this is it,
your only chance.

542
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,436
Separate approaches.

543
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:48,190
No closer than two blocks
and no uniforms. Three minutes.

544
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:50,442
And I need a set of eyes inside.

545
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:55,906
Excuse me?

546
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:59,493
Weightlifters in matching suits and
earpieces? They're hardly disguised.

547
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,620
-Well, it's what I have.
-Fine, I'll go in.

548
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:04,915
You don't have communication.
You can't carry a walkie-talkie.

549
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:07,042
-Tourists have cell phones.
-No, no.

550
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,419
You can't send her in there alone.

551
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,464
All right, I won't.

552
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:26,853
Don't look so anxious.
We're supposed to be married.

553
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:30,482
Well, maybe we're not
getting along today.

554
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:34,403
Hold my hand.

555
00:43:35,488 --> 00:43:40,325
-But don't crush it.
-Sorry. A nervous newlywed.

556
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,831
Oh, look. Look, honey, the oculus.

557
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,667
That could be the "demon's hole"
in the poem.

558
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:50,627
Why are the tombs at an angle?

559
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:53,004
They're facing east
to worship the rising sun.

560
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,714
But this is a Christian church.

561
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:58,009
New religions often adopt
the existing customs and holidays...

562
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:00,011
...to make conversion
less of a shock.

563
00:44:00,847 --> 00:44:02,681
Like the 25th of December?

564
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:05,308
It's the pagan celebration
of the Unconquered Sun...

565
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:08,186
...and also makes a handy date
for the birth of Christ.

566
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:10,021
-Let's check the recesses.
-Okay.

567
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:13,400
I'll go to the right.
I'll meet you at 180 degrees.

568
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:17,320
Follow me, please.

569
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:21,116
Now, the Pantheon, which means
"Temple of All Gods"...

570
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:25,579
...was originally built as a temple
to all the gods of ancient Rome...

571
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:27,914
...in 27 B.C.

572
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:31,501
Although the design of the building
is usually credited...

573
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,879
...to Apollodorus of Damascus....

574
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:36,715
Robert!

575
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:40,302
Robert.

576
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:44,598
It's Raphael's tomb.

577
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:47,225
-But it's the wrong one.
-What are you talking about?

578
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:51,730
He was moved here in 1759, a century
after Diagramma was published.

579
00:44:51,898 --> 00:44:54,483
Where was he originally buried?

580
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,735
Urbino, I think.
"Santi's earthly tomb."

581
00:44:56,903 --> 00:44:59,529
What could it possibly be?
"Santi's earthly tomb."

582
00:45:01,616 --> 00:45:04,075
Damn it. Santi's tomb.

583
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:06,578
It must mean a chapel that he built.

584
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:08,914
He's not buried in it, he designed it.

585
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:11,333
The "demon's hole,"
it's not that oculus.

586
00:45:11,501 --> 00:45:13,084
It's an undercroft. It's a crypt.

587
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:14,920
-Are there any questions?
-Yes.

588
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,255
Yes.

589
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:20,759
Did Raphael Santi ever design
a chapel with an ossuary annex...

590
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:23,762
...and an angel figure commissioned
by the Catholic Church?

591
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:27,599
I'm sorry, I can only think of one.

592
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:31,102
One is good.

593
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,605
-Wrong? What do you mean?
-It's the Chigi Chapel...

594
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:35,941
...in the church
of the Santa Maria del Popolo.

595
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:39,277
It was once called the Capella della
Terra, the Chapel of the Earth.

596
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:41,780
Earth, the first element. That's it.

597
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:45,242
-You were certain about the Pantheon.
-We have four minutes.

598
00:45:47,954 --> 00:45:49,704
Back to the Vatican? You can't.

599
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:52,290
If you care at all
about your church, you'll listen.

600
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:54,125
My church?

601
00:45:55,795 --> 00:45:58,129
My church comforts
the sick and dying.

602
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,673
My church feeds the hungry.

603
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,968
What does your church do,
Mr. Langdon?

604
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:06,221
That's right, you don't have one.

605
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:10,141
Take him if you want.
I'm done with him.

606
00:46:22,572 --> 00:46:25,699
All right, this makes sense.
Look, right in front of the church.

607
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:27,534
An obelisk, a lofty pyramid.

608
00:46:27,702 --> 00:46:30,328
Egyptian symbol
adopted by the Illuminati.

609
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:33,623
If he's going to kill him,
he'll do it here.

610
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:51,266
Eight o'clock.

611
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:02,152
Robert.

612
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,256
No, no, here. It's an annulus.

613
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,495
Which one is the Chigi Chapel?

614
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:55,372
It's in one of these apses.

615
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:49,611
Pyramids in a Catholic church.

616
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:53,323
This is it. This is the Chigi Chapel.

617
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:12,800
The demon's hole.

618
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:18,473
But it's askew.

619
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:20,099
Come here.

620
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:29,234
Hand me your flashlight.

621
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:31,027
What's that?

622
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:32,839
I call as my witness Christ the Lord...

623
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:35,883
...who will be my judge,
that my vote is given...

624
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:38,970
...to the one before God
I think should be elected.

625
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:07,915
I elect as the most high pontiff,
Dominic Scolamiero.

626
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:24,140
Edoardo Rossi.

627
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:27,518
They are voting for themselves
to prevent a majority.

628
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:31,481
They are waiting for the prefefiti
to be rescued.

629
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:35,818
Perhaps we should as well, yes?

630
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:55,922
Not until the smoke is white...

631
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:59,509
...will the College of Cardinals
have chosen a new Holy Father.

632
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:03,805
For now, the Vatican seat
of ultimate power remains vacant.

633
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:12,897
Get the body out of there,
and search the rest of the building.

634
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:14,899
-Chartrand!
-Sir?

635
00:53:15,067 --> 00:53:17,485
Outside, a perimeter.
Secure but invisible.

636
00:53:17,653 --> 00:53:19,195
No lights, no guns, nobody knows.

637
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:20,405
-Understand?
-Yes, sir.

638
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:22,532
I'm calling all off-duty.

639
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:24,534
No information.

640
00:53:25,244 --> 00:53:27,537
Is it Raphael?

641
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:29,497
The chapel is Raphael.

642
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:32,625
But the sculptures are Bernini.

643
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:38,631
The unknown Illuminati master...

644
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:40,800
...Bernini?

645
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:43,845
He worked for the Church.

646
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:46,431
Almost exclusively.

647
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:49,684
But the Illuminati were infiltrators.

648
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:53,438
There wasn't a powerful organization
they didn't penetrate...

649
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:56,983
...including the Vatican
by hiding in plain sight.

650
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:03,239
Habakkuk and the Angel.

651
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:07,034
He's the prophet that predicted
the annihilation of the Earth.

652
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:11,622
"Let angels guide thee
on thy lofty quest."

653
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,961
This is the first marker.

654
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:19,005
The path is alive.

655
00:54:31,852 --> 00:54:33,311
Southwest.

656
00:54:33,479 --> 00:54:35,605
It was pointing southwest.

657
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:39,192
Earth, air, fire, water.
We're looking for a Bernini sculpture...

658
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,526
...having to do with air.

659
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:43,613
The second church is somewhere
southwest of here.

660
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,156
You're sure this time?

661
00:54:45,324 --> 00:54:48,784
I need a map showing
all the churches of Rome.

662
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:53,831
I could use it now.

663
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:32,703
All right, the purple areas with these
black crosses represent the churches.

664
00:55:33,205 --> 00:55:35,540
But nothing intersects the line
until it hits--

665
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:38,709
-Until it hits St. Peter's.
-Michelangelo designed St. Peter's...

666
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:41,254
-...not Bernini.
-Michelangelo designed the Basilica.

667
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:43,297
Bernini designed St. Peter's Square.

668
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:46,509
The second marker must be
a statue in St. Peter's Square.

669
00:55:52,391 --> 00:55:54,642
It's 10 minutes till 9.
Can you go any faster?

670
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:57,645
Not unless you want the full attention
of the world press.

671
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:10,199
There was no consensus
after the first ballot...

672
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:14,537
...but Cardinal Baggia, the Italian,
is the odds-on favorite....

673
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:18,249
There is no new Pope,
but it is possible...

674
00:56:18,417 --> 00:56:22,670
...that Cardinal Guidera, the Spaniard,
is the most probable....

675
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:29,343
It is possible that Cardinal Ebner,
from Germany, is the favorite....

676
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:33,639
Stem cell research is murder!

677
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:36,684
You're condemning sick people to die.

678
00:56:36,852 --> 00:56:38,603
Man is not God.

679
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:52,908
There, another obelisk.

680
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:56,287
Check the crowd. It's almost 9.
He's gotta be here already.

681
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:33,991
There must be 100 statues
up there.

682
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:37,119
None of them are angels.
Those are all saints.

683
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:41,999
How in God's name would anyone
create a sculpture about air?

684
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:52,843
Bas-relief. Of course.
It's still a sculpture.

685
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:55,680
Check the ground.
Look at the carvings.

686
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:58,516
Look for another having something
to do with air.

687
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:21,580
"West Ponente." West wind.

688
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:24,083
Vittoria!

689
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:25,501
Here it is.

690
00:58:26,378 --> 00:58:29,672
West wind. An angel
blowing out five streaks of air.

691
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,424
This is it.

692
00:59:35,197 --> 00:59:37,198
Get the police!

693
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,034
Call an ambulance!

694
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:50,795
He's still alive.

695
01:00:05,936 --> 01:00:08,896
His chest.
They punctured his lungs.

696
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:25,579
Clear the square.

697
01:01:28,977 --> 01:01:31,687
"--from within your walls to squeeze
life from the Bishop."

698
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:35,357
He's actually claiming responsibility
for the death of His Holiness.

699
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:37,902
That's ridiculous.
He died of a stroke.

700
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:41,155
It implies the Illuminati murdered him
with his own medication.

701
01:01:41,323 --> 01:01:43,157
What?

702
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:45,242
Down here.

703
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:48,370
"With man's solution
we stilled his heart.

704
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:52,249
With his own needle
did we pierce his unholy veil."

705
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:56,170
Did the Holy Father take any kind
of medication by injection?

706
01:01:56,338 --> 01:01:57,504
Tinzaparin.

707
01:01:58,423 --> 01:01:59,840
He had thrombophlebitis.

708
01:02:00,008 --> 01:02:03,344
He took an injection every day.
But no one knew that.

709
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:04,595
Someone knew.

710
01:02:04,763 --> 01:02:08,098
Well, he had health concerns
and seizures as well.

711
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:11,685
But he took steps to make sure
he was watched, for safety.

712
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:14,939
He didn't want it made public,
so we have no reason to discuss it.

713
01:02:15,106 --> 01:02:17,650
Tinzaparin is lethal
in the wrong dosage.

714
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:20,235
An overdose could cause
massive internal bleeding...

715
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:21,570
...and brain hemorrhages.

716
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:25,532
It might look like a stroke at first, but in
a few days his body would show signs.

717
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,117
This could easily be examined.

718
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:28,953
In case you're not aware of it...

719
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:32,498
...papal autopsy is prohibited
by Vatican law.

720
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:34,917
We're not going to defile
His Holiness's body...

721
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:36,710
...just because his enemies claim--

722
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:39,922
-Why would they send this letter now?
-Well, to cause panic.

723
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:42,424
"The sun will blind at midnight...

724
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:45,219
...and neither police nor professors
can stop it."

725
01:02:45,971 --> 01:02:47,346
He knows I'm here.

726
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:50,349
Obviously they were hoping
this letter would become public.

727
01:02:50,517 --> 01:02:52,518
We might be wise to preempt
their attempt...

728
01:02:52,686 --> 01:02:55,813
...by making an announcement
of our own to refute this absurd claim.

729
01:02:55,981 --> 01:02:57,523
That's out of the question.

730
01:02:57,691 --> 01:03:00,818
Cardinal Strauss has insisted
this entire matter be kept internal.

731
01:03:00,986 --> 01:03:03,153
He shouldn't be aware of it.
He's in conclave.

732
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:07,241
His final instructions before sealing
the doors were very clear.

733
01:03:07,409 --> 01:03:10,452
Cardinal Strauss does not dictate
Vatican protocols.

734
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:13,080
As you say, yet, technically...

735
01:03:13,248 --> 01:03:14,790
...now that conclave has begun...

736
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:18,002
...it's his privilege and duty
to control public announcements.

737
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:20,838
I've drafted a release
about the incident in the piazza...

738
01:03:21,006 --> 01:03:24,508
...but any other statements
are specifically prohibited.

739
01:03:24,676 --> 01:03:29,513
For that, Cardinal has asked me
to remind you we have a chimney.

740
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:36,020
Commander Richter,
the search for the device?

741
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:40,065
Well, we've turned the power on and
off to about 20 percent of Vatican City.

742
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:42,860
-Nothing on the video yet.
-We're running out of options.

743
01:03:43,028 --> 01:03:44,862
How long would you need
to evacuate?

744
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:48,198
If I pull all my men from the search
for the bomb, 30 minutes.

745
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:54,329
Mr. Langdon. You have been right
so far about the path. It's now 9:15.

746
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:56,457
How quickly can you find
the next church?

747
01:03:56,624 --> 01:03:59,543
The lines on the carving pointed east,
away from Vatican City.

748
01:03:59,711 --> 01:04:02,546
But there were five of them,
so there's room for error.

749
01:04:02,714 --> 01:04:05,049
About 20 churches intersect
those lines.

750
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:07,217
None of them have names
that invoke fire.

751
01:04:07,385 --> 01:04:10,179
So a Bernini sculpture must be inside
one of them that does.

752
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:12,473
We'll need to get
into the archives to find it.

753
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:15,476
-Would you escort Mr. Langdon?
-Yes, Father.

754
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,063
Silvano's journals.

755
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:21,899
The killer's name could be in here.
May I stay?

756
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,068
Please. Fine, of course.

757
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:27,571
Professor.

758
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:31,742
Would it surprise you to find
those clothes suit you?

759
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:34,745
It would surprise the hell out of me.

760
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:55,015
The Vatican is expressing sympathy
for the mugging victim...

761
01:04:55,183 --> 01:04:59,478
...a Düsseldorf tourist,
now confirmed dead....

762
01:04:59,646 --> 01:05:04,108
The Vatican police have a suspect
in custody....

763
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:11,281
The Vatican will allow the crowd back
into St. Peter's Square...

764
01:05:11,449 --> 01:05:13,158
...where security will be doubled....

765
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:17,579
The Vatican did admit that where there
are crowds, so often follows crime.

766
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:20,499
We're trying now to get the name
of the tourist who was--

767
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:23,335
-Oh, wait.
-Hand to the right. Keep panning.

768
01:05:23,503 --> 01:05:25,420
We're getting word now of smoke.

769
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:27,881
Smoke from
the Sistine Chapel chimney.

770
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:30,300
Apparently there's been
another vote.

771
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:32,136
The smoke is black.

772
01:05:32,303 --> 01:05:35,013
Once again, the cardinals have failed
to reach consensus...

773
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:37,766
...and the Catholic Church
remains without a leader.

774
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:48,318
What are you looking for now?

775
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:50,863
Church assets.

776
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:52,573
I beg your pardon?

777
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:54,658
Artwork. It's valuable.

778
01:05:54,826 --> 01:05:57,995
Corporations tend to keep track
of their holdings.

779
01:05:58,163 --> 01:06:01,790
The Catholic Church
is not a corporation, it's a beacon.

780
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:05,586
A source of inspiration for one billion
lost and frightened souls.

781
01:06:05,753 --> 01:06:08,422
Sure, I get that. It's also a bank.

782
01:06:19,184 --> 01:06:22,686
Commander Olivetti said I was not
to leave your side this time.

783
01:06:25,064 --> 01:06:26,273
It wasn't me, it was her.

784
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:26,959
Power is now cut to Zone 73.

785
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:29,461
No light reaction on the monitor.

786
01:07:29,629 --> 01:07:33,131
Restore power and move on to 74.

787
01:07:43,643 --> 01:07:44,935
What sort of signs?

788
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:48,021
I'm sorry?

789
01:07:51,693 --> 01:07:56,238
If the Holy Father was given
an overdose of Tinzaparin...

790
01:07:56,447 --> 01:07:58,448
...what signs would his body bear?

791
01:08:00,368 --> 01:08:02,244
Bleeding of the oral mucosa.

792
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:04,871
His tongue.

793
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:09,167
Postmortem, the blood congeals and
turns the inside of the mouth black.

794
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:13,505
Even after 14 days?

795
01:08:13,673 --> 01:08:16,591
It wouldn't show up
until at least a week after his death.

796
01:08:21,848 --> 01:08:23,765
He was very important to me.

797
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:27,602
Yeah, I understand.

798
01:08:32,859 --> 01:08:35,027
Will you come with me, please?

799
01:08:42,076 --> 01:08:44,202
Signore, would you organize
a security team...

800
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:46,788
...to escort Miss Vetra and myself
down to the crypt?

801
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:49,249
-Yes, sir.
-We'll be leaving straightaway.

802
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:09,811
Do you smoke?

803
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:13,774
A little bit.

804
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:16,568
Then you better sit down
before you keel over.

805
01:09:18,905 --> 01:09:21,323
And what's all that right there?

806
01:09:22,909 --> 01:09:25,243
What does this say
in Italian right here...

807
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:27,829
...next to the Ecstasy of Saint Teresa?
Right there.

808
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:33,043
"Moved at suggestion of the artist."

809
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:37,672
"Moved"? To another church.
At the suggestion of Bernini?

810
01:09:38,341 --> 01:09:39,841
I don't know.

811
01:09:41,552 --> 01:09:44,429
Here. Translate all of this for me...

812
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:46,598
...and I'll buy you a pack of smokes.

813
01:09:46,766 --> 01:09:48,600
I'm looking for a reference to fire.

814
01:09:48,768 --> 01:09:50,352
Fires.

815
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:55,565
-"Seraphim," meaning "the fiery one."
-Right.

816
01:09:56,692 --> 01:10:00,946
"His great, golden spear,
a point of fire."

817
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:06,785
Then "woman left completely afire."

818
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:10,956
Ecstasy of Saint Teresa.
Saint Teresa on fire.

819
01:10:11,124 --> 01:10:14,084
So this sculpture
was moved to this church?

820
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:19,131
Why did they shut down the system?
They know we're down here.

821
01:10:19,298 --> 01:10:23,218
If there's no power,
there's no oxygen.

822
01:10:23,386 --> 01:10:26,388
-Can we get out?
-The door is electronic.

823
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:29,474
Oh, God.

824
01:10:29,642 --> 01:10:31,393
Well, that's disappointing.

825
01:10:33,187 --> 01:10:34,396
Where are we going?

826
01:10:34,605 --> 01:10:36,565
To see my father.

827
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:38,150
I don't understand.

828
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:42,237
I was orphaned when I was 9 years
of age. A bombing in Ulster.

829
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:45,699
The UVF protesting the visit
of a Catholic archbishop.

830
01:10:45,867 --> 01:10:50,537
The archbishop felt responsible,
and he adopted me the following day.

831
01:10:50,705 --> 01:10:53,832
I was raised by him
and by the Church.

832
01:10:54,125 --> 01:10:56,543
He was the wisest man I ever met.

833
01:10:56,711 --> 01:11:00,505
Even when I was young and stubborn,
I wanted to be ordained.

834
01:11:00,673 --> 01:11:04,176
But I was brought up in Italy, so l
also wanted to do my military service.

835
01:11:04,343 --> 01:11:05,927
I wanted to fight.

836
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:09,764
He told me, "Learn to fly."

837
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:12,184
So I joined
the Aeronautica Militare...

838
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:16,104
...flew helicopters,
bringing the wounded back to hospital.

839
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:17,439
He was a great man.

840
01:11:17,648 --> 01:11:19,691
Your father died?

841
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:22,277
Fourteen days ago.

842
01:11:23,571 --> 01:11:25,572
Command, do you read me?

843
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:28,450
Power is off. Oxygen is very low.

844
01:11:28,659 --> 01:11:30,785
Come in. Can you read me?

845
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:32,037
Can you get anything?

846
01:11:32,205 --> 01:11:36,458
No. The walls are lead-lined.
There's no signal.

847
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:00,495
This way.

848
01:15:09,004 --> 01:15:13,007
If the Holy Father was murdered,
the implications are profound.

849
01:15:13,634 --> 01:15:15,760
Vatican security is impenetrable.

850
01:15:15,928 --> 01:15:18,847
No one from the outside
could have got anywhere near him.

851
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:20,640
It was someone on the inside.

852
01:15:20,808 --> 01:15:23,601
And we can trust no one.

853
01:15:25,396 --> 01:15:28,440
No light reaction on Zone 97.

854
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:32,861
Based on the rate the battery
is using power...

855
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:36,114
...the device will detonate
just before midnight.

856
01:15:58,053 --> 01:16:00,054
Holy Father...

857
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:04,434
...when I was young, you told me
the voice in my heart was God's voice.

858
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:08,146
You said I should follow it,
no matter how painful.

859
01:16:08,314 --> 01:16:10,064
Forgive me.

860
01:16:10,232 --> 01:16:11,649
Please.

861
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:13,568
Give me strength.

862
01:16:14,862 --> 01:16:19,866
What I do, I do in the name
of everything you believe.

863
01:16:30,544 --> 01:16:32,045
Remove the cover.

864
01:16:35,382 --> 01:16:37,175
Did you not hear me?

865
01:16:37,468 --> 01:16:40,512
Signore, by law,
we are at you command, but--

866
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:44,057
One day I will ask your forgiveness for
putting you in this position.

867
01:16:44,225 --> 01:16:46,059
But today I ask your obedience.

868
01:16:47,978 --> 01:16:50,688
Vatican laws are there
to protect this church.

869
01:16:50,856 --> 01:16:55,026
And it's in that spirit that I command
you to break one of them now.

870
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:52,208
God help us.

871
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:08,141
Santa Maria della Vittoria.
Do you know it?

872
01:18:08,309 --> 01:18:11,561
-Yes, I do.
-It's the next church.

873
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:29,662
I think someone just tried to kill me.

874
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:32,165
-l promise you we had no idea--
-He knows I'm here.

875
01:18:32,333 --> 01:18:33,916
-Yes.
-You heard me ask permission.

876
01:18:34,126 --> 01:18:36,044
-You gave me an escort.
-We had no idea...

877
01:18:36,211 --> 01:18:40,381
...that portions of our white zones
were cross-wired with that building.

878
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:42,508
Commander Richter
was extending the search.

879
01:18:42,676 --> 01:18:46,137
If he had known,
he never would have killed the power.

880
01:18:47,181 --> 01:18:49,432
Or there is the other possibility.

881
01:18:49,642 --> 01:18:52,143
Is it conceivable the Illuminati...

882
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:55,146
...have infiltrated the Swiss Guard?

883
01:18:58,442 --> 01:18:59,942
Perhaps.

884
01:19:05,449 --> 01:19:09,994
-l wanna speak to the camerlengo.
-The camerlengo is unavailable.

885
01:19:10,204 --> 01:19:13,873
He's found evidence that the
Holy Father was indeed murdered.

886
01:19:15,292 --> 01:19:17,627
-He is seeking guidance.
-From whom?

887
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:20,338
From God.

888
01:19:20,673 --> 01:19:22,382
-Make an effort. Please.
-Yeah, yeah.

889
01:19:55,499 --> 01:19:56,833
The journals. Where are they?

890
01:19:59,837 --> 01:20:02,088
Who took the journals
from this desk?

891
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:12,306
Someone is here? What is this?

892
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:15,184
Signore, this is unacceptable.

893
01:20:15,769 --> 01:20:19,105
For a camerlengo to enter the chapel
once conclave has begun....

894
01:20:19,273 --> 01:20:22,525
Forgive me.
There's been a development.

895
01:20:33,036 --> 01:20:35,705
His Holiness Celestine V
was murdered.

896
01:20:35,873 --> 01:20:39,542
Is it so hard to believe
it could happen again?

897
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:42,003
Signori, please a moment.

898
01:20:42,171 --> 01:20:44,756
Please, signori.

899
01:20:46,133 --> 01:20:48,718
Our Church is at war.

900
01:20:49,803 --> 01:20:53,264
We are under attack
from an old enemy.

901
01:20:53,432 --> 01:20:54,807
The Illuminati.

902
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:57,560
They have struck us from within.

903
01:20:58,061 --> 01:21:00,188
Murdering our Holy Father.

904
01:21:00,647 --> 01:21:05,318
And threatening us all with destruction
at the hands of their new god, science.

905
01:21:05,486 --> 01:21:08,696
They call it retribution.
They think it justified.

906
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:11,741
Because of the Church's attacks
on men of science in the past.

907
01:21:11,909 --> 01:21:13,576
And it's true.

908
01:21:14,203 --> 01:21:15,495
Since the days of Galileo...

909
01:21:15,662 --> 01:21:19,415
...this Church has tried to slow
the relentless march of progress...

910
01:21:19,583 --> 01:21:21,876
...sometimes with misguided means.

911
01:21:23,337 --> 01:21:27,006
But science and religion
are not enemies.

912
01:21:27,174 --> 01:21:28,841
There are simply some things...

913
01:21:29,009 --> 01:21:32,094
...that science is just too young
to understand.

914
01:21:32,262 --> 01:21:37,350
So the Church pleads,
"Stop. Slow down. Think. Wait."

915
01:21:37,851 --> 01:21:40,603
And for this they call us backward.

916
01:21:40,771 --> 01:21:42,939
But who is more ignorant...

917
01:21:43,190 --> 01:21:45,358
...the man
who cannot define lightning...

918
01:21:45,526 --> 01:21:49,445
...or the man who does not respect
its natural awesome power?

919
01:21:50,072 --> 01:21:52,615
The battle is well underway, signori.

920
01:21:53,283 --> 01:21:54,992
We must defend ourselves.

921
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:58,162
But what if this time we fight
their stealth with openness?

922
01:21:58,330 --> 01:22:00,957
Combat their wicked scheme
with simple truth...

923
01:22:01,124 --> 01:22:04,168
...and end this brutish battle
once and for all.

924
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:13,261
We must open the doors, tear down the
blacken curtains and speak to our flock.

925
01:22:13,428 --> 01:22:16,347
If the outside world could see
this Church as I do...

926
01:22:16,515 --> 01:22:18,683
...looking beyond the ritual
of these walls...

927
01:22:18,851 --> 01:22:22,353
...they would see a modern miracle.

928
01:22:22,521 --> 01:22:25,523
A brotherhood of imperfect,
simple souls...

929
01:22:25,691 --> 01:22:28,401
...who want nothing more
than to be voices of compassion...

930
01:22:28,569 --> 01:22:31,946
...in a world spinning out of control.

931
01:22:33,073 --> 01:22:36,576
Signori, I ask...

932
01:22:37,536 --> 01:22:39,579
...l pray...

933
01:22:39,746 --> 01:22:42,081
...that you break this conclave.

934
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:45,334
Open the doors...

935
01:22:45,502 --> 01:22:47,753
...evacuate St. Peter's Square...

936
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:50,882
...and tell the world the truth.

937
01:23:24,583 --> 01:23:26,459
Oh, my God.

938
01:23:26,627 --> 01:23:28,544
Get him down!

939
01:23:29,755 --> 01:23:31,547
No!

940
01:23:40,724 --> 01:23:42,600
There, there, that chain.
On that pulley.

941
01:23:42,768 --> 01:25:47,266
This bench. Get this pew up here.
Make a ladder.

942
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:53,374
My son...

943
01:26:55,126 --> 01:26:57,837
...God answers all prayers...

944
01:26:59,130 --> 01:27:00,965
...but sometimes his answer is no.

945
01:27:03,176 --> 01:27:05,803
The College will not break conclave.

946
01:27:07,097 --> 01:27:08,430
May I suggest...

947
01:27:09,266 --> 01:27:10,641
...you direct your energies...

948
01:27:10,809 --> 01:27:14,478
...to helping the Swiss Guard find
this explosive device...

949
01:27:15,146 --> 01:27:16,814
...if it exists.

950
01:27:18,108 --> 01:27:19,650
And leave Church leadership...

951
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:23,821
...to its leaders.

952
01:27:37,002 --> 01:27:38,168
Eminence.

953
01:27:40,839 --> 01:27:45,175
There is a growing fear
that without the four prefefiti...

954
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:50,931
...a two-thirds majority
for any candidate will not be possible.

955
01:27:51,099 --> 01:27:53,934
-Unless--
-Speak plainly.

956
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:56,645
It is the recommendation of many...

957
01:27:56,813 --> 01:28:00,441
...that you ask to be removed
from your post as Great Elector...

958
01:28:01,484 --> 01:28:05,070
...thereby making yourself eligible...

959
01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:08,365
...to wear the Ring of the Fisherman.

960
01:28:09,534 --> 01:28:11,368
Well...

961
01:28:11,536 --> 01:28:13,829
...if it is God's will...

962
01:28:21,087 --> 01:28:22,838
...may his will be done.

963
01:28:51,242 --> 01:28:53,577
Signore, are you okay?

964
01:29:18,561 --> 01:29:21,438
Those journals are private property.
I demand you return them.

965
01:29:21,606 --> 01:29:25,192
They're material evidence
in a Vatican investigation.

966
01:29:27,195 --> 01:29:29,405
I am an Italian citizen.
My rights do not end...

967
01:29:29,572 --> 01:29:32,366
-...just because I crossed to the other--
-This is not Italy.

968
01:29:32,534 --> 01:29:34,576
It's not even Rome, it's the Vatican.

969
01:29:34,744 --> 01:29:36,537
A country of its own
with its own laws.

970
01:29:36,705 --> 01:29:40,040
And when those journals passed
the border, they became my property.

971
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:42,042
I will give them back to you...

972
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:45,546
...when I've decided they contain
nothing of value to the investigation.

973
01:29:45,714 --> 01:29:48,841
Do you have something to hide,
Comandante Richter?

974
01:29:51,344 --> 01:29:53,637
Do you, Dr. Vetra?

975
01:30:15,493 --> 01:30:18,454
Were it up to me,
it would not be this way.

976
01:30:19,873 --> 01:30:22,541
It's a sin to kill with pain.

977
01:30:23,668 --> 01:30:25,502
It's a sin to kill without reason.

978
01:30:29,382 --> 01:30:30,924
Father...

979
01:30:32,552 --> 01:30:33,927
...they make me a sinner.

980
01:31:13,718 --> 01:31:16,303
Saint Teresa on fire.

981
01:31:19,390 --> 01:31:21,058
Professor Langdon?

982
01:31:22,268 --> 01:31:24,186
-What direction is that?
-West, I think.

983
01:31:24,354 --> 01:31:27,189
"'Cross Rome
the mystic elements unfold."

984
01:31:28,608 --> 01:31:30,901
Piazza Barberini is here.

985
01:31:31,069 --> 01:31:34,071
Saint Teresa is here.

986
01:31:34,656 --> 01:31:36,782
Where is the Santa Maria
del Popolo?

987
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:39,576
-Santa Maria del Popolo?
-Yes.

988
01:31:40,662 --> 01:31:42,162
Thank you.

989
01:31:42,872 --> 01:31:44,998
St. Peter's is here.

990
01:31:45,166 --> 01:31:47,292
We are here.

991
01:31:48,837 --> 01:31:50,379
A church with water....

992
01:31:52,715 --> 01:31:54,508
Wait, wait, wait.

993
01:31:54,676 --> 01:31:56,343
"'Cross Rome."

994
01:31:58,471 --> 01:32:00,514
The poem must mean it literally,
cross Rome.

995
01:32:00,682 --> 01:32:02,850
Professor, Commander Richter
has ordered me...

996
01:32:03,017 --> 01:32:04,726
...to escort you to the Vatican.

997
01:32:04,894 --> 01:32:06,061
Piazza Navona.

998
01:32:06,229 --> 01:32:09,982
Earth. Air. Fire. Water.

999
01:32:10,149 --> 01:32:12,109
Cross Rome.

1000
01:32:12,277 --> 01:32:14,444
Bernini's Four Rivers.

1001
01:32:15,154 --> 01:32:18,490
Professor Langdon, the Vatican insists
that I have to take you back.

1002
01:32:18,658 --> 01:32:21,660
The Vatican is about to see
its fourth cardinal murdered tonight.

1003
01:32:21,828 --> 01:32:26,748
Now, look. You can do as they say
and force me back to the Vatican...

1004
01:32:26,916 --> 01:32:28,959
...where we can all mourn
his death together.

1005
01:32:29,127 --> 01:32:33,046
Or you can show how real cops act,
and take me to the Piazza Navona...

1006
01:32:33,214 --> 01:32:36,425
...where we still might be able
to stop it.

1007
01:32:39,387 --> 01:32:42,097
Oh, by all means, let's talk it over.

1008
01:32:42,265 --> 01:32:44,933
In 14 minutes, he's gonna be dead.

1009
01:32:50,857 --> 01:32:52,024
This way, professor.

1010
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:02,451
Yes, Padre?

1011
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:06,455
At 11:15,
if the Church is still in peril...

1012
01:33:06,664 --> 01:33:09,541
...give the order
to evacuate the cardinals.

1013
01:33:10,043 --> 01:33:12,127
But with dignity.

1014
01:33:12,295 --> 01:33:16,256
Let them walk out into St. Peter's
Square with their heads held high.

1015
01:33:16,424 --> 01:33:19,092
I don't want the last image
of this Church to be of men...

1016
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:21,428
...sneaking out the back door.

1017
01:33:38,529 --> 01:33:40,572
"Let angels guide thee...."

1018
01:33:45,954 --> 01:33:47,496
There it is.

1019
01:33:47,705 --> 01:33:49,831
-There it is.
-Professor, I know this fountain.

1020
01:33:49,999 --> 01:33:53,502
-There is no angel on it.
-The dove. The Angel of Peace.

1021
01:33:53,711 --> 01:33:56,004
And it's looking in what direction?

1022
01:33:56,214 --> 01:33:57,923
East, I think.

1023
01:34:09,352 --> 01:34:10,644
Professor, just wait here.

1024
01:34:11,312 --> 01:34:13,063
Stay put.

1025
01:34:49,684 --> 01:34:51,768
Good evening. Can you help me?

1026
01:34:52,186 --> 01:34:54,396
I'm waiting for a doctor.

1027
01:35:10,872 --> 01:35:12,581
Come here.

1028
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:18,086
Stay calm. Don't shoot.

1029
01:35:55,416 --> 01:35:56,500
Hey!

1030
01:36:11,349 --> 01:36:12,766
Help!

1031
01:36:12,934 --> 01:36:13,975
Somebody help!

1032
01:36:53,349 --> 01:36:55,058
Help, somebody!

1033
01:38:09,133 --> 01:38:10,717
Cardinal Baggia?

1034
01:38:10,885 --> 01:38:12,135
Cardinal Baggia.

1035
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:16,431
Where was he hiding you?

1036
01:38:16,599 --> 01:38:18,725
The Church of Illumination,
where is it?

1037
01:38:19,352 --> 01:38:22,646
Castel-- Castel Sant'Angelo.

1038
01:38:24,148 --> 01:38:25,565
Castle of the Angel.

1039
01:38:48,547 --> 01:38:51,508
Sir, there's news
about Cardinal Baggia.

1040
01:38:52,051 --> 01:38:55,595
The cardinal told Langdon he was
being held in Castel Sant'Angelo.

1041
01:38:55,763 --> 01:38:58,682
If Langdon's right,
that's where the bomb is.

1042
01:38:58,849 --> 01:39:00,600
Send everyone we can spare.

1043
01:39:00,768 --> 01:39:01,935
And you?

1044
01:39:02,103 --> 01:39:03,812
I'm staying here.

1045
01:39:17,159 --> 01:39:18,702
Vittoria.

1046
01:39:19,537 --> 01:39:21,037
-You're all right.
-I'm all right.

1047
01:39:21,205 --> 01:39:22,789
What about you? I just heard.

1048
01:39:22,957 --> 01:39:24,332
I'm all right, I'm okay.

1049
01:39:30,589 --> 01:39:33,883
Robert, we can't trust Richter.
He took Silvano's journals.

1050
01:39:34,051 --> 01:39:36,761
There must be something in there
he doesn't want us to see.

1051
01:39:36,929 --> 01:39:38,722
The head of the Swiss Guard.

1052
01:39:40,141 --> 01:39:43,226
Castel Sant'Angelo, it's close,
so the signal from that camera...

1053
01:39:43,394 --> 01:39:45,145
...could still reach the Vatican.

1054
01:39:47,064 --> 01:39:49,899
The Church of Illumination
is somewhere here.

1055
01:39:50,067 --> 01:39:52,360
Your canister is inside it.

1056
01:40:12,715 --> 01:40:14,174
Come with me.

1057
01:40:18,095 --> 01:40:21,723
For 400 years, the Illuminati
met right under the Church's nose.

1058
01:40:21,891 --> 01:40:25,352
The Vatican used this as a hideout
and as a prison for their enemies.

1059
01:40:25,519 --> 01:40:30,398
If the explosion happens here, would
the blast radius take out the Vatican?

1060
01:40:30,566 --> 01:40:32,609
And part of Rome along with it.

1061
01:40:34,653 --> 01:40:36,029
Go on.

1062
01:40:50,961 --> 01:40:52,796
They're pointing to it. The angels.

1063
01:40:52,963 --> 01:40:54,923
The canister must be down there.
Come on.

1064
01:41:43,305 --> 01:41:45,640
-Where are they going?
-To search the outer castle.

1065
01:41:45,808 --> 01:41:48,143
No, no. It has to be here!

1066
01:41:53,190 --> 01:41:54,983
Robert, it's a dead end.

1067
01:41:55,151 --> 01:41:57,193
No, it's not.

1068
01:41:57,361 --> 01:41:59,737
See if you can find a flashlight.

1069
01:42:16,672 --> 01:42:19,090
All of these stones
are rectangular granite.

1070
01:42:19,258 --> 01:42:22,343
Except right here. What is this?

1071
01:42:26,056 --> 01:42:27,265
It's a pentagram.

1072
01:42:27,683 --> 01:42:28,766
An eye...

1073
01:42:29,477 --> 01:42:31,060
...that leads to....

1074
01:42:31,228 --> 01:42:32,729
Nowhere.

1075
01:42:41,906 --> 01:42:43,156
Robert?

1076
01:42:45,075 --> 01:42:47,577
These walls overlap
and there's a passageway back here.

1077
01:42:47,745 --> 01:42:49,287
Here, let me have the flashlight.

1078
01:43:13,103 --> 01:43:16,231
It's a passageway
that leads to the Vatican.

1079
01:43:16,398 --> 01:43:17,941
An ancient escape route.

1080
01:43:20,778 --> 01:43:21,819
My God.

1081
01:43:24,782 --> 01:43:26,115
Here.

1082
01:43:28,369 --> 01:43:30,286
Look.

1083
01:43:52,017 --> 01:43:54,519
This would be the perfect place
for the Illuminati to blow...

1084
01:43:54,687 --> 01:43:55,728
...the whole building up.

1085
01:43:55,896 --> 01:43:57,939
Here. Here.

1086
01:44:02,987 --> 01:44:06,990
Get on the radio. Get the word out.
Conclave remains sealed.

1087
01:44:07,157 --> 01:44:09,617
But the camerlengo gave the order
for evacuation at--

1088
01:44:09,785 --> 01:44:11,578
I'm countermanding it.

1089
01:44:17,167 --> 01:44:19,294
This is it. This is their church.

1090
01:44:21,672 --> 01:44:24,674
The canister should be lit
by artificial light.

1091
01:44:48,449 --> 01:44:49,616
It's not here, Robert.

1092
01:44:49,783 --> 01:44:52,577
"A shining star at the end of the path."
It has to be.

1093
01:44:52,745 --> 01:44:54,621
It's not here.

1094
01:44:54,788 --> 01:44:56,789
-What did the poem say?
-Nothing.

1095
01:44:56,957 --> 01:45:01,878
Nothing, it's all over. It was just the
four lines, each one describing the....

1096
01:45:11,472 --> 01:45:12,722
There's a fifth brand.

1097
01:45:13,390 --> 01:45:15,600
It's not an ambigram,
it's just two crossed keys.

1098
01:45:15,768 --> 01:45:18,561
-The symbol for the Vatican.
-No.

1099
01:45:19,396 --> 01:45:20,813
No, the papacy.

1100
01:45:20,981 --> 01:45:22,398
They intend to kill him.

1101
01:45:22,566 --> 01:45:25,193
Before they destroy the Vatican,
they're gonna kill...

1102
01:45:25,361 --> 01:45:27,987
-...and brand the pope himself.
-There is no pope.

1103
01:45:28,155 --> 01:45:29,781
Tempe sede vacante.

1104
01:45:29,948 --> 01:45:31,908
ll camerlengo.

1105
01:45:33,827 --> 01:45:36,579
-We have to warn him.
-Take a step back, please.

1106
01:45:37,706 --> 01:45:40,249
Take your cell phone
from your pocket.

1107
01:45:43,504 --> 01:45:45,004
Throw it in the fire.

1108
01:45:56,141 --> 01:45:57,558
Murderer.

1109
01:45:57,726 --> 01:46:00,269
You know, when they call me...

1110
01:46:00,521 --> 01:46:01,896
...and they all call me...

1111
01:46:02,523 --> 01:46:05,066
...it is so important to them
that I know...

1112
01:46:05,234 --> 01:46:07,944
...that what they ask
is the Lord's will.

1113
01:46:08,112 --> 01:46:10,947
Or Allah's, or Yahweh's.

1114
01:46:12,366 --> 01:46:14,283
And I suppose they're right.

1115
01:46:18,664 --> 01:46:22,333
Because if he was not vengeful,
I would not exist, now would I?

1116
01:46:23,127 --> 01:46:25,712
I've had several chances
to eliminate you tonight.

1117
01:46:25,879 --> 01:46:28,089
You're still alive
because you have no weapon...

1118
01:46:28,257 --> 01:46:31,342
...and they didn't ask me to kill you,
but if you pursue me...

1119
01:46:31,510 --> 01:46:33,636
...it is another matter.

1120
01:46:40,352 --> 01:46:41,644
Be careful.

1121
01:46:42,229 --> 01:46:44,355
These are men of God.

1122
01:46:56,869 --> 01:46:58,619
The camerlengo.

1123
01:47:19,224 --> 01:47:21,517
-Camerlengo will grant you audience.
-Good.

1124
01:47:21,894 --> 01:47:23,811
I'd like to see him alone.

1125
01:47:25,689 --> 01:47:28,858
That's impossible, sir.
No one sees the camerlengo alone.

1126
01:47:29,026 --> 01:47:31,235
Have you forgotten
who you're working for?

1127
01:47:33,030 --> 01:47:34,489
No, sir.

1128
01:47:58,972 --> 01:48:01,057
Have you come to make me a martyr?

1129
01:48:08,315 --> 01:48:10,900
Here. Here. Here.

1130
01:49:37,696 --> 01:49:40,072
-l need to see the camerlengo.
-He is not available.

1131
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:43,159
-l demand to see the camerlengo!
-He is not available.

1132
01:49:43,952 --> 01:49:45,620
We'll see about that.

1133
01:49:55,047 --> 01:49:57,923
All locked up. Senza chiave,
it's a one-way portal.

1134
01:49:58,091 --> 01:50:00,343
The only entrance
is on the other side.

1135
01:50:00,510 --> 01:50:03,220
No! Hey!

1136
01:50:03,388 --> 01:50:08,601
I don't care who he talks to.
He doesn't go into that room.

1137
01:50:10,646 --> 01:50:13,814
This is Robert Langdon and Dr. Vetra!
Open the door!

1138
01:50:15,776 --> 01:50:16,942
Open up!

1139
01:50:20,822 --> 01:50:22,198
Open the door!

1140
01:50:22,407 --> 01:50:24,033
Hey!

1141
01:50:27,371 --> 01:50:29,372
The camerlengo is in danger.

1142
01:50:43,136 --> 01:50:44,970
He's the one! He's got a gun!

1143
01:50:49,476 --> 01:50:51,185
-Illuminatus!
-You bastard.

1144
01:50:51,353 --> 01:50:54,021
-Illuminatus!
-Sanctimonious bastard!

1145
01:51:03,657 --> 01:51:05,074
Order the evacuation.

1146
01:51:05,242 --> 01:51:07,034
We only have 19 minutes.

1147
01:51:11,373 --> 01:51:13,124
Here, he's--

1148
01:51:13,291 --> 01:51:15,292
Get the helicopter
for the older cardinals.

1149
01:51:15,460 --> 01:51:16,836
Yes, sir.

1150
01:51:29,850 --> 01:51:31,183
Robert?

1151
01:51:31,351 --> 01:51:34,645
The brand, the symbol,
could it have another meaning?

1152
01:51:40,652 --> 01:51:43,404
Crossed keys.
But those are upside down.

1153
01:51:44,030 --> 01:51:45,531
St. Peter.

1154
01:51:46,742 --> 01:51:48,492
The first pope...

1155
01:51:49,369 --> 01:51:51,078
...was crucified upside down.

1156
01:51:51,246 --> 01:51:53,789
-On Vatican Hill.
-A few hundred feet below us.

1157
01:51:53,957 --> 01:51:55,291
Necropolis, city of the dead.

1158
01:51:55,459 --> 01:51:57,877
"Upon this rock
I will build my church."

1159
01:51:58,044 --> 01:52:00,921
Or bring it down upon itself.

1160
01:52:01,798 --> 01:52:04,800
The bomb is in St. Peter's tomb.

1161
01:52:19,983 --> 01:52:21,484
The grid is still cycling.

1162
01:52:21,651 --> 01:52:24,028
The power to this section
must be down.

1163
01:53:22,379 --> 01:53:25,214
It must be here. It must be.

1164
01:53:36,726 --> 01:53:38,394
Don't touch it.

1165
01:53:39,521 --> 01:53:41,605
We have seven minutes.

1166
01:53:47,070 --> 01:53:49,405
Robert, hold this.

1167
01:54:30,488 --> 01:54:32,489
It's cold down here, isn't it?

1168
01:54:32,657 --> 01:54:33,991
What's wrong?

1169
01:54:34,576 --> 01:54:36,952
Cold decreases battery life.

1170
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:40,915
We may have less than five minutes.

1171
01:54:41,583 --> 01:54:42,917
So?

1172
01:54:43,084 --> 01:54:45,669
If I pull the power
with less than five minutes...

1173
01:54:45,837 --> 01:54:48,380
...the residual charge
won't hold suspension.

1174
01:54:50,258 --> 01:54:53,218
We should leave it here
and get clear if we can.

1175
01:54:53,386 --> 01:54:55,596
-At least down here, the damage--
-No!

1176
01:54:55,764 --> 01:54:57,932
-No, wait!
-Father!

1177
01:55:00,352 --> 01:55:02,269
We are live here
at St. Peter's Square...

1178
01:55:02,437 --> 01:55:05,940
...where despite a bomb threat
and an order of evacuation...

1179
01:55:06,107 --> 01:55:09,693
...the crowd is actually growing
in size as we await an official...

1180
01:55:09,861 --> 01:55:11,779
...announcement
from the Vatican spokesman...

1181
01:55:11,947 --> 01:55:13,948
...as to the exact nature
of the threat...

1182
01:55:14,115 --> 01:55:17,701
...and whether or not they
are treating it as a credible danger.

1183
01:55:25,335 --> 01:55:26,543
This way.

1184
01:55:59,369 --> 01:56:01,286
A bomb?

1185
01:56:06,001 --> 01:56:09,837
Roberto, there's an emergency.
I'll take her up alone.

1186
01:56:13,925 --> 01:56:15,676
He's got clearance.

1187
01:56:40,910 --> 01:56:42,828
Oh, my God.

1188
01:58:44,367 --> 01:58:45,742
Get down!

1189
02:01:38,541 --> 02:01:40,625
Cardinal Strauss?

1190
02:01:40,918 --> 02:01:44,838
It was the camerlengo.
He saved us all!

1191
02:01:45,006 --> 02:01:48,967
He saved the church and he is alive.

1192
02:01:49,927 --> 02:01:51,511
Praise God. Praise God.

1193
02:01:57,268 --> 02:01:58,685
He is alive.

1194
02:01:58,853 --> 02:02:02,356
He sacrificed himself for all of us.

1195
02:02:09,364 --> 02:02:11,573
It's so incredible. He survived.

1196
02:02:30,426 --> 02:02:34,388
You know, the worst thing
we thought would happen...

1197
02:02:34,555 --> 02:02:38,558
...was that our work would fall into
the hands of the energy companies.

1198
02:02:40,770 --> 02:02:43,063
We thought
we could change the world.

1199
02:02:43,606 --> 02:02:44,815
So naive.

1200
02:02:44,982 --> 02:02:48,610
No, no. Not naive.

1201
02:02:48,778 --> 02:02:50,612
Innocent, maybe.

1202
02:02:50,780 --> 02:02:53,073
But that's not a crime.

1203
02:02:54,450 --> 02:02:56,576
I'm not so sure.

1204
02:02:58,162 --> 02:03:00,664
Go back to work.

1205
02:03:01,582 --> 02:03:03,667
Change the world.

1206
02:03:22,603 --> 02:03:25,647
A gift. Do you understand
what I'm saying?

1207
02:03:25,815 --> 02:03:28,650
For Catholics, for everyone.

1208
02:03:28,818 --> 02:03:32,404
Camerlengo's age
shouldn't be an obstacle.

1209
02:03:32,572 --> 02:03:34,781
Signori, you are no doubt aware...

1210
02:03:34,949 --> 02:03:38,618
...that by holy law the man is ineligible
for election to the papacy.

1211
02:03:38,786 --> 02:03:40,662
He is not a cardinal, he is a priest.

1212
02:03:40,830 --> 02:03:42,539
He is of insufficient age.

1213
02:03:42,707 --> 02:03:45,834
Well, maybe there's a way
we could consider the possibilities.

1214
02:03:46,002 --> 02:03:50,630
I am sorry. The protocols of conclave
are not subject to modification.

1215
02:03:50,798 --> 02:03:52,716
I will not call a ballot on this matter.

1216
02:03:52,884 --> 02:03:55,719
But, signore,
you would not call the ballot.

1217
02:03:55,887 --> 02:03:57,179
Surely you remember...

1218
02:03:57,346 --> 02:04:00,140
...you gave up your post
as Great Elector.

1219
02:04:00,308 --> 02:04:02,476
They are singing
in St. Peter's Square.

1220
02:04:02,643 --> 02:04:05,353
And what happened here tonight
transcends our laws.

1221
02:04:05,521 --> 02:04:06,563
Does it?

1222
02:04:06,731 --> 02:04:09,858
Is it God's will
that we give ourselves over to frenzy?

1223
02:04:10,026 --> 02:04:11,651
Discard the rules of the Church?

1224
02:04:11,819 --> 02:04:14,404
Perhaps we need not discard them.

1225
02:04:15,198 --> 02:04:21,119
Signore, I am thinking now of Romano
Pontifici Eligendo, Numero Sessanta--

1226
02:04:21,287 --> 02:04:23,079
Acclamation by Adoration.

1227
02:04:24,499 --> 02:04:27,584
If the Holy Spirit speaks
through us...

1228
02:04:27,752 --> 02:04:30,128
...and we call a man's name
out loud--

1229
02:04:30,296 --> 02:04:32,923
That is election by adoration.

1230
02:04:33,090 --> 02:04:35,509
-He's God's choice.
-Yes.

1231
02:04:35,676 --> 02:04:40,680
And the candidate need only be
an ordained member of the clergy...

1232
02:04:40,848 --> 02:04:45,560
...present in the Sistine Chapel
at the moment of his election.

1233
02:04:53,611 --> 02:04:55,111
I think we have it settled.

1234
02:05:18,803 --> 02:05:20,011
Signore Camerlengo.

1235
02:05:20,638 --> 02:05:21,680
Yes?

1236
02:05:21,847 --> 02:05:25,892
The cardinals ask you to join them
in conclave as soon as possible.

1237
02:05:26,060 --> 02:05:27,269
Me?

1238
02:05:27,436 --> 02:05:29,521
Yes, Padre.

1239
02:05:52,086 --> 02:05:53,253
What are you doing?

1240
02:05:53,421 --> 02:05:56,506
Silvano's journals. I want them back.

1241
02:06:20,948 --> 02:06:22,949
Richter said...

1242
02:06:24,118 --> 02:06:26,119
...His Holiness suffered
from seizures...

1243
02:06:26,287 --> 02:06:28,622
...but steps were taken...

1244
02:06:29,749 --> 02:06:31,416
...for safety.

1245
02:06:35,796 --> 02:06:38,798
"Made sure he was watched,"
he said.

1246
02:06:40,301 --> 02:06:43,970
What if he was trying
to give me this key?

1247
02:06:44,639 --> 02:06:47,015
That's the papal office.

1248
02:06:47,183 --> 02:06:49,059
If the pope was worried
about seizures...

1249
02:06:49,226 --> 02:06:52,312
...he must have had Richter
install cameras without telling anyone.

1250
02:06:52,480 --> 02:06:55,148
To keep an eye on him. For safety.

1251
02:06:56,984 --> 02:06:58,735
Maybe it records.

1252
02:07:09,747 --> 02:07:11,456
I read the journals, Patrick.

1253
02:07:11,624 --> 02:07:14,209
The scientist kept journals. So?

1254
02:07:14,377 --> 02:07:16,086
Well, you figure prominently
in them.

1255
02:07:16,796 --> 02:07:17,837
Really?

1256
02:07:18,005 --> 02:07:22,425
Bentivoglio wasn't just a physicist,
he was also a Catholic priest.

1257
02:07:23,010 --> 02:07:27,013
And as such, he was deeply conflicted
about the implications of his work...

1258
02:07:27,181 --> 02:07:29,683
...and in need of spiritual guidance.

1259
02:07:29,850 --> 02:07:31,685
Like Galileo.

1260
02:07:32,645 --> 02:07:35,897
About a month ago, he requested
an audience with the pope...

1261
02:07:36,065 --> 02:07:37,774
...but you know that.

1262
02:07:37,942 --> 02:07:41,194
Because you granted the audience,
and you were also present during it.

1263
02:07:41,362 --> 02:07:44,364
The God particle.
To actually claim an act of creation.

1264
02:07:44,532 --> 02:07:46,366
The blasphemy. The arrogance.

1265
02:07:46,534 --> 02:07:49,119
The Holy Father didn't see it
like that.

1266
02:07:49,286 --> 02:07:51,204
He urged him to go public.

1267
02:07:51,372 --> 02:07:53,289
His Holiness
thought that the discovery...

1268
02:07:53,457 --> 02:07:57,502
...could actually scientifically prove
the existence of a divine power...

1269
02:07:57,670 --> 02:08:00,672
...and begin to bridge the gap
between science and religion.

1270
02:08:00,840 --> 02:08:03,550
His work was not religious,
it was sacrilegious.

1271
02:08:03,718 --> 02:08:08,596
But you saw the pope's position
as a softening of Church law.

1272
02:08:09,390 --> 02:08:13,017
As an old man's weakness.
Your father's weakness.

1273
02:08:13,686 --> 02:08:15,353
You murdered the Vicar of Christ.

1274
02:08:15,521 --> 02:08:19,399
He raised me to protect this Church,
even from within.

1275
02:08:19,567 --> 02:08:23,570
And then you conjured up
an old enemy from the past.

1276
02:08:23,738 --> 02:08:25,572
The Illuminati.

1277
02:08:25,740 --> 02:08:29,868
You found the ancient brands in the
papal vaults, and put them to use.

1278
02:08:30,035 --> 02:08:31,077
To spread fear.

1279
02:08:31,245 --> 02:08:33,663
The cardinals are men of belief.

1280
02:08:33,831 --> 02:08:37,333
Right now, their belief in evil
is uniting them.

1281
02:08:37,501 --> 02:08:40,670
The entire Catholic world
will be united by this attack.

1282
02:08:40,838 --> 02:08:42,756
There is no attack.

1283
02:08:43,758 --> 02:08:46,551
You're trying to convince the cardinals
they're in a war...

1284
02:08:46,719 --> 02:08:48,803
...so they will choose a warrior
to lead them.

1285
02:08:48,971 --> 02:08:50,096
We are at war.

1286
02:08:50,264 --> 02:08:52,223
We're weak
when we should be strong.

1287
02:08:52,391 --> 02:08:56,227
If science is allowed
to claim the power of creation...

1288
02:08:56,395 --> 02:08:58,104
...what is left for God?

1289
02:08:58,272 --> 02:08:59,939
It didn't work, Patrick.

1290
02:09:01,442 --> 02:09:04,819
-It isn't finished.
-Oh, yes, it's finished.

1291
02:09:06,030 --> 02:09:07,947
It's finished.

1292
02:09:08,949 --> 02:09:11,785
I've shown the journals
to Father Simeon.

1293
02:09:11,952 --> 02:09:14,245
The moment the doors
to the conclave open...

1294
02:09:14,413 --> 02:09:17,332
...he will tell the cardinals
what you've done.

1295
02:09:17,875 --> 02:09:20,376
I was planning on doing this alone.

1296
02:09:23,297 --> 02:09:24,714
Put it down.

1297
02:09:27,384 --> 02:09:30,136
But perhaps it's better
that you're here.

1298
02:09:30,304 --> 02:09:31,429
Put it down.

1299
02:09:33,265 --> 02:09:35,058
Put it away.

1300
02:09:47,404 --> 02:09:50,406
Help! He's the one! He's got a gun!

1301
02:09:54,245 --> 02:09:56,496
-Illuminatus!
-You bastard.

1302
02:09:56,664 --> 02:09:59,207
-Illuminatus!
-Sanctimonious bastard!

1303
02:10:14,598 --> 02:10:17,600
And get the helicopter
for the older cardinals, right?

1304
02:10:21,188 --> 02:10:22,355
Robert?

1305
02:10:22,523 --> 02:10:25,275
The brand, the symbol,
could it have another meaning?

1306
02:11:08,861 --> 02:11:11,821
I've been summoned by
the College of Cardinals.

1307
02:12:25,270 --> 02:12:26,562
Gently...

1308
02:12:26,730 --> 02:12:28,231
...but within our walls.

1309
02:13:31,920 --> 02:13:35,631
Father, into thy hands
I commend my spirit.

1310
02:14:29,353 --> 02:14:31,020
Church sources now confirm...

1311
02:14:31,188 --> 02:14:33,439
...that Camerlengo
Father Patrick McKenna...

1312
02:14:33,607 --> 02:14:38,402
...has died of internal injuries
sustained in his heroic fall.

1313
02:14:38,570 --> 02:14:40,696
Crowds of the faithful are calling for...

1314
02:14:40,864 --> 02:14:44,867
...the camerlengo's immediate
canonization and sainthood.

1315
02:14:45,035 --> 02:14:48,704
The Vatican also announced
the death of three of its cardinals...

1316
02:14:48,872 --> 02:14:51,374
...in the fire
at Santa Maria della Vittoria.

1317
02:14:51,542 --> 02:14:54,043
--as we await the appearance
of the new Holy Father...

1318
02:14:54,211 --> 02:14:55,837
...Cardinal Baggia of Italy...

1319
02:14:56,004 --> 02:14:59,590
...one of the four original prefefiti,
who, despite terrorist attempts...

1320
02:14:59,758 --> 02:15:01,926
...at disruption,
seems to have been selected...

1321
02:15:02,094 --> 02:15:04,512
...in one of the swiftest
and smoothest conclaves...

1322
02:15:04,680 --> 02:15:06,472
...in modern Church history.

1323
02:15:13,438 --> 02:15:15,356
Professor Langdon? Please.

1324
02:15:32,791 --> 02:15:36,127
A token of thanks
from His Holiness...

1325
02:15:36,295 --> 02:15:39,380
...and from his new camerlengo.

1326
02:15:40,632 --> 02:15:43,426
We are grateful you saved his life.

1327
02:15:43,594 --> 02:15:46,846
And it's our understanding
that you require this text...

1328
02:15:47,014 --> 02:15:49,056
...to complete your scholarly work.

1329
02:15:51,101 --> 02:15:54,228
We ask only that
in your last will and testament...

1330
02:15:54,396 --> 02:15:56,689
...you ensure...

1331
02:15:56,857 --> 02:15:58,774
...it finds its way home.

1332
02:16:01,528 --> 02:16:02,612
Of course.

1333
02:16:02,779 --> 02:16:04,989
And when you write of us...

1334
02:16:05,157 --> 02:16:07,950
...and you will write of us...

1335
02:16:08,118 --> 02:16:10,411
...may I ask one thing?

1336
02:16:10,579 --> 02:16:12,163
Do so gently.

1337
02:16:14,666 --> 02:16:16,167
I'll try.

1338
02:16:16,335 --> 02:16:18,169
Religion is flawed...

1339
02:16:18,837 --> 02:16:21,672
...but only because man is flawed.

1340
02:16:21,840 --> 02:16:25,259
All men, including this one.

1341
02:16:39,858 --> 02:16:41,692
He chose the name Luke.

1342
02:16:44,655 --> 02:16:47,365
There's been many Marks
and Johns...

1343
02:16:49,034 --> 02:16:50,618
...never a Luke.

1344
02:16:51,328 --> 02:16:52,703
It's said he was a doctor.

1345
02:16:54,039 --> 02:16:58,042
It's quite a message,
science and faith all in one.

1346
02:16:58,210 --> 02:16:59,835
The world is in need of both.

1347
02:17:02,714 --> 02:17:05,132
You will counsel him wisely.

1348
02:17:05,467 --> 02:17:09,053
I am an old man.
I will counsel him briefly.

1349
02:17:14,685 --> 02:17:16,727
Mr. Langdon...

1350
02:17:21,900 --> 02:17:26,529
...thanks be to God for sending
someone to protect his Church.

1351
02:17:30,742 --> 02:17:33,411
I don't believe he sent me, Father.

1352
02:17:33,578 --> 02:17:35,871
Oh, my son...

1353
02:17:36,039 --> 02:17:38,082
...of course he did.
