1
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:53,043
Stop!

2
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:13,063
Hey, y'all

3
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,418
Little bugger!

4
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,589
Not live rounds, Lara.

5
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,926
He's in real pain right now.

6
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:46,430
This is a major remodel.
This is a disaster.

7
00:05:46,514 --> 00:05:50,267
Was it programmed to stop before it
took my head off?

8
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:54,104
Ah, well, that would be a no.

9
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:57,942
But you said make it more challenging,
so...

10
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,860
Hence, the live fire.

11
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,451
Live rounds again.

12
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,453
Poor Simon.

13
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:11,789
What has she done to you?

14
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:10,639
Oh. Very funny.

15
00:07:10,723 --> 00:07:13,100
I'm only trying to turn you into a lady.

16
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:17,688
And a lady should be modest.

17
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,566
Yes, a lady should be modest.

18
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,667
Brothers and sisters,

19
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:42,171
today is the 15th of May,

20
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:46,508
the first day of the planetary alignment,

21
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:51,013
and we are still no nearer to discovering
the location of the key.

22
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:52,681
It seems

23
00:07:52,765 --> 00:07:55,643
we are running out of time.

24
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:58,103
This is not acceptable.

25
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:03,942
Mr. Powell,
your explanation for this, please?

26
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:09,031
I have no explanation.
Certainly no excuses.

27
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:12,743
Except to once again
respectfully remind the council

28
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,536
that we are working from clues

29
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,414
based on
ancient cosmological models

30
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:21,377
predating Aristotle.

31
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:25,047
But I'm happy to announce
that we're almost ready.

32
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,384
And I am supremely confident

33
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:32,888
that we will have our answer in time
for the relevant planetary alignment.

34
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:36,767
So, we will have possession
of the key in

35
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:39,478
one week.

36
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,607
Yes, indeed. One week.

37
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:48,070
This is good news, Mr. Powell,
but remember,

38
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,906
we have only a single opportunity

39
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:54,326
to retrieve the two halves of the triangle.

40
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:57,079
And if we fail,

41
00:08:57,162 --> 00:09:01,125
we must wait another 5,000 years.

42
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,087
I don't know about you,
but that's more time

43
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,298
than I am prepared to commit
to this enterprise.

44
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,427
We shall be ready.

45
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:14,930
Trust me.

46
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:29,653
- We're not... We're not ready, are we?
- No.

47
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:39,329
Good morning, Lara.
And what a beautiful morning it is.

48
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:42,958
Back to work, I'm afraid.

49
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,211
It's adventure time.

50
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:50,466
Egypt again.

51
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:54,178
It's nothing but pyramids and sand.

52
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:57,222
I know. Gets everywhere. In the cracks.

53
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:02,686
Spanish galleon?

54
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,816
Do you know what day it is, Hillary?

55
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:11,820
Yes, of course.

56
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:14,990
The 15th.

57
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:18,827
And that is never a good day.

58
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,520
I miss you, Daddy.

59
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:50,400
I wish we could get back the time
that was stolen from us.

60
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:16,927
My father would loved to have seen this.

61
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:22,349
Tonight Pluto and Neptune
align with Uranus.

62
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,893
It's the first stage of the alignment
of all nine planets

63
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:28,146
culminating in a full solar eclipse.

64
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:31,316
It only happens once every 5,000 years.

65
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,235
When is the eclipse?

66
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,279
One week from today.

67
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:40,284
But there is plenty to look out for
until then.

68
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:43,412
Incredible.

69
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:19,531
I wish you could remember her.
She loved you so much.

70
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,325
Mummy!

71
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:26,038
I wish I could remember her, too.

72
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:29,207
- I still have you, Daddy.
- Yes, you do.

73
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:39,051
The exact alignment of the planets
necessary to activate the triangle

74
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:43,555
only occurs once every 5,000 years.

75
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:47,976
But that will prove to be
just long enough

76
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,355
for little Lara Croft to grow up

77
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,066
and to find it.

78
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:57,105
Bryce!

79
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:00,817
Hello, fellas.

80
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,403
- How's business?
- Bryce!

81
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:07,824
Okay, okay. I'm coming. I'm coming.

82
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,581
We have 83 rooms.
Why can't you live in the house?

83
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:17,209
Well, I'm a free spirit, me.

84
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:18,460
Right.

85
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,963
What's that smell?

86
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:24,716
5:00 a.m. Let's go.

87
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:30,097
This had better be good.

88
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,936
It's a clock.

89
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:39,940
I found it last night. It was ticking.

90
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:46,113
Must be one of them ticking clocks, eh?

91
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:49,407
It was hidden in a secret room.

92
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,368
Bryce.

93
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,871
Don't start.

94
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:59,918
Well, Lara, it's a clock. It ticks.
It tells the time. It's wrong.

95
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:02,045
It started ticking

96
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:05,382
last night during the first stage
of the alignment.

97
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:12,597
Well, gonna need some coffee.

98
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,771
Okay, in we go.

99
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,693
Looks pretty ordinary to me.

100
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,528
Well, keep looking.

101
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:34,494
Your coffee, sir.
Decaf latte with non-fat milk.

102
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:39,666
Oh, champion. Steaming sump oil.

103
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:47,424
Wait. What did you do?

104
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:50,927
- I don't know. What did I do?
- Where is that?

105
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:53,930
I don't know.
I just took my hand off the fiber optics.

106
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:55,724
What is that?

107
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:59,060
- Oh, bugger!
- Bugger.

108
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,359
Screw 13 to quadrant four.

109
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:11,698
- Screw 14 to quadrant three.
- Oh, please.

110
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:16,077
It's my map,
so I know where they all came from.

111
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,997
It's camouflage.

112
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,427
Okay.

113
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,231
Hidden within.

114
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:48,985
What is that?

115
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,742
The All Seeing Eye.

116
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:13,051
Lot 121, a Louis XV Ormolu
mounted bracket clock.

117
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:17,347
Showing on my left, £1,800,000.

118
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:21,226
£1,800,000. Thank you.
£1,800,000. £1,900,000.

119
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,228
£2,000,000. £2,000,000, now.

120
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:26,314
£2,100,000. £2,100,000, now.

121
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:30,819
£2,100,000.
Any advance on £2,100,000?

122
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:34,239
Any more?
£2,100,000. £2,200,000. Thank you, sir.

123
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:37,075
£2,200,000 now.

124
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:40,245
At £2,200,000. £2,300,000.

125
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:42,414
£2,300,000. £2,400,000.

126
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:47,002
Lady's bid, £2,400,000 now. £2,400,000.

127
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:49,087
Against you, sir. Two million five? No.

128
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,590
£2,400,000, then.
Lady's bid at £2,400,000.

129
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:54,384
£2,500,000.

130
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:57,971
In a new place at £2,500,000.

131
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:01,766
Any more at £2,500,000?

132
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:03,977
Sold.

133
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,647
Lara, my dear.

134
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:09,941
- Mr. Wilson.
- Let's go into my study.

135
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:12,152
Let me take that for you.

136
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:14,946
Lara Croft. I don't believe it.

137
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:19,784
- I'll just be a minute.
- Hi.

138
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:27,208
You still pretending to be
a photojournalist?

139
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:31,421
You know, I think it's really cool
that you still have a day job,

140
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:35,342
even though it's obviously just for show.

141
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:39,596
So, Alex, are you still pretending
to be an archeologist?

142
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,767
Lara,

143
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:46,311
do we always have to fight like this?

144
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:48,730
I mean, maybe we don't.

145
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:51,691
- Maybe we do.
- Why?

146
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:54,611
- You stole my prayer wheels.
- Stole? Stole?

147
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,654
From you? You know, that's funny.
You know, it's...

148
00:19:56,738 --> 00:20:00,116
It's not like you ever really owned them
or anything.

149
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,787
Hey, you're the tomb raider.

150
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,663
Mr. West, we are ready for you.

151
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:08,708
Oh, I think your clients need you.

152
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:13,046
Go ahead. You're wanted on the floor.

153
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:17,300
After all, as you once said
so memorably, "It's all just a business."

154
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:19,844
Right? So go do business.

155
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:20,970
Go.

156
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:49,791
Lara, this is a unique object.

157
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,086
Only one of the dials is working.

158
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:55,505
It glows, like the eye, lesser.

159
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:59,050
But it seems to be getting brighter.

160
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:01,553
And it's also running backwards,

161
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:04,973
like it's not so much keeping time,
but counting down to something.

162
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:06,307
- Yes.
- And look at the back.

163
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:10,895
It's as though it fits into something,
almost like a key.

164
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:18,194
Yes. Yes, fascinating.
Incredibly beautiful.

165
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:21,114
My father once told me

166
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:23,867
of a magical triangle
stamped with the All Seeing Eye.

167
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,036
He said it gave its possessor
extraordinary power,

168
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,456
the power to control time.

169
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:33,293
He called it the Triangle of Light.
Have you heard of it?

170
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:35,420
No. No, I haven't.

171
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:44,971
He always steered his own course,
your father.

172
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,974
He was a great man.

173
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:53,146
Would you like some port?

174
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:56,483
- It's really very fine.
- No.

175
00:21:56,566 --> 00:21:59,068
I can't help you, Lara.

176
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:03,448
This clock truly is mystery.

177
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:25,762
- Hello.
- Lara?

178
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,764
Hello, it's Mr. Wilson.

179
00:22:27,889 --> 00:22:31,768
Yes. Well, I...
You see, I had a second thought

180
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,020
about that clock.

181
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:37,023
There is a man
who may be able to help you.

182
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:40,777
I gave him your number.
His name is Manfred Powell.

183
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:42,779
You should see him.

184
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:45,198
Thank you. I will.

185
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:47,867
- Goodbye, Lara.
- You take care.

186
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:49,702
Thank you.

187
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:53,206
Bugger.

188
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,643
Forgive me.

189
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:28,992
Lady Croft.

190
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:31,828
- Ah, Mr. Powell.
- Oh, no, no, no. Good heavens, no.

191
00:23:31,953 --> 00:23:35,748
I'm actually his associate, Mr. Pimms.

192
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:39,669
- Mr. Pimms?
- Yeah, like the beverage.

193
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,347
Yeah, she's here.

194
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:56,978
What does Mr. Powell do?

195
00:23:57,812 --> 00:24:00,523
He's a lawyer. I'm his law clerk.

196
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:04,819
It's a fairly recent appointment,
but enjoying it, all the varied work.

197
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,823
- A lawyer.
- Isn't it obvious?

198
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,452
Lady Croft, my pleasure.

199
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:15,788
- Manfred Powell, Q.C.
- Good morning.

200
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:19,834
I believe you are quite an authority
on things ancient and mythological.

201
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:21,294
Well, I travel.

202
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:24,297
No, no, Mr. Wilson said
you were quite the archeologist.

203
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,673
Please.

204
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:29,469
Oh, he's very sweet.

205
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:31,888
He knew your father, I believe.

206
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,351
Yes, they were great friends.

207
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:40,063
I had the honor of meeting him
myself once, in Venice.

208
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:43,816
I was so sorry to hear about his death.

209
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:51,324
This is the clock I spoke of.

210
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:56,996
Very interesting.

211
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,919
It's a shame
you only brought photographs.

212
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:08,049
Nevertheless, it is fascinating.

213
00:25:08,216 --> 00:25:11,094
You said it started ticking the night
of the alignment.

214
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:12,261
Yes.

215
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:19,519
- You said you were a lawyer?
- Yes.

216
00:25:20,228 --> 00:25:22,730
And the study of clocks is a hobby?

217
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:25,608
This is an obsession.

218
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:30,530
Really my speciality.
My practice centers around antiquities.

219
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:33,032
But the origin of this clock

220
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:34,951
completely eludes me.

221
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:40,289
I think I've never seen anything quite
so beautiful

222
00:25:40,415 --> 00:25:42,583
that I know so little about.

223
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:50,133
This is a pleasurable torment.

224
00:25:51,843 --> 00:25:53,803
My ignorance amuses me.

225
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:58,433
"My ignorance amuses me."

226
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:02,353
"My ignorance amuses me"?

227
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:05,982
Yes, well, I've always found
your ignorance quite amusing.

228
00:26:06,107 --> 00:26:08,484
- Powell, however, is not ignorant.
- No?

229
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:09,986
No.

230
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:12,196
He's a liar.

231
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:29,172
- Anything you need?
- No. Thank you, Hillary.

232
00:26:29,297 --> 00:26:32,300
- Don't you stay up too late.
- I won't.

233
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,259
Forward team, wait for my command.

234
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:23,726
In position awaiting your order.

235
00:28:47,435 --> 00:28:48,686
Bastards!

236
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:51,606
Bloody hell!

237
00:28:57,278 --> 00:28:58,988
On the left. On the left.

238
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:23,095
Come on, Simon!

239
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:31,020
Bugger!

240
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:22,631
Lara, Lara, are you there? Pick up!

241
00:31:23,007 --> 00:31:25,593
Lara, can you hear me? Are you okay?

242
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:30,431
I'm in the equipment room.
They're stealing my bloody clock.

243
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:31,974
I know. I saw them.

244
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:39,523
- You have to be my eyes.
- Are you armed?

245
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:42,902
After a fashion, yes.

246
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:45,488
All right. Three bad guys.

247
00:31:45,613 --> 00:31:47,615
Number one standing by
the Aston Martin.

248
00:31:47,698 --> 00:31:48,949
Right.

249
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:52,620
Bingo!

250
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:11,555
- Next.
- Okay, number two,

251
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,557
crouched by the McLaren.

252
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:18,020
Oh, bugger!

253
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:30,825
- Are you okay?
- I just found my car keys.

254
00:32:45,381 --> 00:32:47,675
You're done, mate. Nice one.

255
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:07,755
I think they've all gone.

256
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:11,425
Well, they got what they came for.

257
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:14,762
Sorry about that.

258
00:34:15,638 --> 00:34:17,014
That's fine.

259
00:34:58,681 --> 00:34:59,848
Hello?

260
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:07,439
What the hell happened here?

261
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:19,118
- Morning.
- Lady Lara Croft?

262
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:21,704
Yes. You have something for me?

263
00:35:31,672 --> 00:35:35,009
I woke up this morning,
and I just hated everything.

264
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,720
Right. Thanks.

265
00:35:42,725 --> 00:35:45,561
Who's Stribling,
Clive and Winterset then?

266
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:50,065
- Sounds like a bunch of lawyers.
- They are a bunch of lawyers.

267
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:54,236
- Well, I'll shut my face again.
- You are nosy.

268
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:56,572
I'm not nosy. I just saw the name.

269
00:35:56,655 --> 00:36:00,200
It was a funny name.
I just asked her what the name was.

270
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:05,331
It's from my father.

271
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:10,669
It was written before he died

272
00:36:10,753 --> 00:36:13,672
and delivered today
as per his instructions.

273
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:16,508
- Blimey!
- Holy...

274
00:36:26,352 --> 00:36:28,937
"To see a world in a grain of sand

275
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:31,440
"and a heaven in a wild flower,

276
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:35,277
"hold infinity in the palm of your hand

277
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:37,529
"and eternity in an hour."

278
00:36:39,198 --> 00:36:40,699
William Blake.

279
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:09,103
The All Seeing Eye.

280
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,919
"My darling daughter,

281
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:37,005
"I knew you'd figure this out.

282
00:37:37,131 --> 00:37:39,842
"If you are reading this letter,
I am no longer with you"

283
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:44,221
and I miss you,
and love you always and forever.

284
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:47,891
It also means I have failed

285
00:37:48,225 --> 00:37:51,437
and must place an awful burden
on your shoulders.

286
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:56,567
"Lara, by now I am sure you will have
discovered the clock I concealed."

287
00:37:57,234 --> 00:38:00,904
The clock is the key, Lara.

288
00:38:00,988 --> 00:38:05,909
"It will unlock the hiding place of two
pieces of a sacred icon."

289
00:38:05,993 --> 00:38:09,830
This is the magical triangle I told you
about when you were a little girl.

290
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:14,418
The Triangle of Light.
But it is no bedtime story.

291
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:18,464
"The triangle was forged from metal
found in the crater of a meteor

292
00:38:18,547 --> 00:38:20,591
"that had fallen to Earth
at the exact moment

293
00:38:20,674 --> 00:38:23,760
"of the previous alignment
of the nine planets.

294
00:38:23,844 --> 00:38:26,430
"The people of the light built a great city
in this crater

295
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:30,434
"where they worshipped the triangle
for its ability to control time.

296
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:35,063
"It gave its possessor a power that
could be used for good or great evil.

297
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:38,859
"An abuse of this power
led to the destruction of the city.

298
00:38:41,278 --> 00:38:45,073
"To be sure no man would ever again
wield this power,

299
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:47,326
"they split the triangle into two pieces

300
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:50,871
"and hid them
at opposite ends of the Earth.

301
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:55,083
"Lara, do you remember the jasmine
that only grows in one temple

302
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:57,961
"along the ancient Khmer trail
in Cambodia?

303
00:38:58,045 --> 00:39:00,130
"Find that,
and you will have found the entrance

00:39:00,214 --> 00:39:02,382
"to the Tomb of the Dancing Light

305
00:39:02,466 --> 00:39:05,469
"where the first half of the triangle
is hidden."

306
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:08,222
You must be there
at the exact moment

307
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:11,558
of the second phase
of the planetary alignment.

308
00:39:11,642 --> 00:39:14,520
"You must hurry.
You have very little time.

309
00:39:14,603 --> 00:39:16,438
"And as the planets move
into alignment,

310
00:39:16,522 --> 00:39:18,982

"This you must prevent at all costs.

00:39:39,503 --> 00:39:43,757
"So, Lara,
I am asking you to complete my work,

00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:48,470
"to find and destroy
both halves of the triangle."

318
00:39:51,807 --> 00:39:56,645
How are you going to get to Cambodia
and get the clock back in 15 hours?

319
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,814
I'll be calling in a favor.

320
00:39:59,648 --> 00:40:02,901
- What kind of favor?
- Well, that is a secret.

321
00:40:02,985 --> 00:40:05,529
If I told you, I'd have to kill you.

322
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:17,583
Lady Croft, are you on target? Over.

323
00:40:17,666 --> 00:40:20,752
Right on target. Thank you, boys.
Over and out.

324
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:04,212
How predictable.

325
00:41:09,009 --> 00:41:10,969
Alex West.

326
00:41:11,762 --> 00:41:14,181
What are you doing here?

327
00:41:54,513 --> 00:41:57,766
We have 72 minutes
to the next alignment.

328
00:41:57,849 --> 00:41:59,768
We have to work faster.

329
00:42:11,154 --> 00:42:12,656
Come on, guys!

330
00:42:50,694 --> 00:42:53,989
Come on, guys! Come on. Pull!

331
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:55,449
Pull! It's coming!

332
00:43:08,462 --> 00:43:09,546
Good.

333
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:45,916
So, any sign of Lady Croft?

334
00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:47,542
Not yet.

335
00:43:47,626 --> 00:43:50,921
Lara's overrated.
She's good, don't get me wrong,

336
00:43:51,004 --> 00:43:53,381
but she's in it for the glory,

337
00:43:53,715 --> 00:43:56,009
whereas I'm in it for the money.

338
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:58,220
Fortunately.

339
00:43:58,303 --> 00:44:01,932
- Into the belly of the beast.
- And out of the demon's ass.

340
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:10,917
Jasmine.

341
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,027
Remember, what we are looking for
is hidden not only in space,

342
00:47:01,111 --> 00:47:02,779
but also in time.

343
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:05,407
The clock is the key.

344
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:16,501
My God.

345
00:47:24,843 --> 00:47:27,846
"Return the iron
to the stone's embrace,

346
00:47:27,929 --> 00:47:29,973
"the wheel of heaven will turn.

347
00:47:30,098 --> 00:47:32,934
"Exhume the light
from its watery grave

348
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:36,604
"to receive the gift of heaven

349
00:47:37,105 --> 00:47:40,191
"as you are condemned
to the depths of hell."

350
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:46,281
Right. Pretty much touch anything
and you get your head chopped off.

351
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:49,826
We have two minutes, Mr. West.

352
00:47:49,951 --> 00:47:52,620
You're the tomb raider. Figure it out.

353
00:48:06,342 --> 00:48:07,385
Mr. West.

354
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:10,513
Tempus fugit.

355
00:48:11,973 --> 00:48:14,476
Yes, "time flies."

356
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:16,895
It's the swords!

357
00:48:16,978 --> 00:48:20,398
Come on, guys. Get up here.
Give me a hand here.

358
00:48:25,195 --> 00:48:28,656
That's it. Come on. Coming down.

359
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:31,451
I want them all down.

360
00:48:31,534 --> 00:48:33,953
Take them,
carry them across the ladders.

361
00:48:34,037 --> 00:48:35,872
Come on, guys. Let's hustle.

362
00:48:37,499 --> 00:48:41,419
All right.
Now slide them into the slots over there.

363
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:46,007
We place the clock here
at the exact moment of alignment.

364
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:48,760
Come on. Let's go! Move it!

365
00:48:51,054 --> 00:48:53,515
Too slow, ladies, too slow. Come on.

366
00:49:00,772 --> 00:49:02,857
- That's it.
- Count it down.

367
00:49:04,526 --> 00:49:07,278
- The timing needs to be exact.
- No shit.

368
00:49:32,095 --> 00:49:33,763
60 seconds to go.

369
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:38,726
59, 58, 57,

370
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:40,186
56,

371
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:44,399
55, 54, 53,

372
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:47,527
52, 51,

373
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:49,654
50 seconds.

374
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:58,746
Cease fire! Hold your fire!

375
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:06,754
- Keep counting.
- You're making a big mistake!

376
00:50:07,005 --> 00:50:09,716
41, 40,

377
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:11,426
- 39...
- Alex West.

378
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:13,178
- ...38...
- Hey, Lara.

379
00:50:13,261 --> 00:50:14,888
- ...37...
- Tourist visa?

380
00:50:14,971 --> 00:50:17,807
- No, I'm working.
- Lady Croft, tell me,

381
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:20,226
is there a good reason
why I just kept you alive?

382
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:23,271
Yes. That is not the true eye.

383
00:50:24,606 --> 00:50:27,984
- This is the true eye.
- It's not, actually.

384
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:29,527
- It's a mirror image.
- Miss Croft,

385
00:50:29,611 --> 00:50:32,697
I think you're trying to cheat me
out of my little ray of sunshine.

386
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,782
Why would I try and cheat you out
of anything now?

387
00:50:34,866 --> 00:50:37,744
I need you to get the piece
so I can steal it from you later.

388
00:50:37,827 --> 00:50:40,163
You're bluffing.
Julius, make a mental note.

389
00:50:40,288 --> 00:50:42,707
Kill Miss Croft
if she attempts any such thing.

390
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:44,667
Yes, sir, Mr. Powell.

391
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:45,877
Well, we can do it my way

392
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,087
or we can all come back in time
for the next alignment

393
00:50:48,171 --> 00:50:50,423
and you are welcome
to try and kill me, then.

394
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:53,551
In, oh, say another 5,000 years.

395
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:02,018
Twelve, eleven,

396
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:03,561
ten,

397
00:51:03,645 --> 00:51:06,064
nine, eight,

398
00:51:07,065 --> 00:51:11,486
seven, six, five,

399
00:51:13,238 --> 00:51:15,865
four, three,

400
00:51:17,158 --> 00:51:19,911
two, one,

401
00:51:22,664 --> 00:51:23,748
zero.

402
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:30,588
Well, I guess she was right.

403
00:51:40,515 --> 00:51:42,684
The log must pierce the urn.

404
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:49,482
Come on!

405
00:51:51,234 --> 00:51:54,028
It's slowing down.
It's never gonna make it.

406
00:52:11,254 --> 00:52:12,338
No.

407
00:52:44,412 --> 00:52:46,581
Pure light, fire and water.

408
00:53:39,926 --> 00:53:40,968
Croft!

409
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:19,924
Get the clock.

410
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:21,300
Got it.

411
00:55:20,568 --> 00:55:21,777
Blast!

412
00:59:20,975 --> 00:59:22,810
Hold it right there!

413
00:59:25,354 --> 00:59:28,858
Lara, give it up.

414
00:59:30,151 --> 00:59:32,486
Are you going to shoot me, Alex?

415
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:29,001
Do you know where I can
make an international call?

416
01:00:31,796 --> 01:00:33,881
My phone is wet.

417
01:00:43,891 --> 01:00:45,142
Yes?

418
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:47,394
Lady Croft, how are you?

419
01:00:47,895 --> 01:00:49,063
Alive.

420
01:00:49,313 --> 01:00:50,815
And kicking, I hope.

421
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,567
- And you?
- Superlative.

422
01:00:53,734 --> 01:00:57,238
Of course, I digress.
You have my half of the triangle.

423
01:00:57,404 --> 01:00:59,532
And you have my father's clock.

424
01:00:59,615 --> 01:01:02,910
Listen, my dear. Without each other
we are quite useless at this point.

425
01:01:03,285 --> 01:01:05,663
We should reevaluate our positions.

426
01:01:05,746 --> 01:01:08,332
Like it or not,
you and I are in business together.

427
01:01:08,582 --> 01:01:10,084
We should have a business meeting.

428
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:14,588
You mean you'd love to have
another opportunity to try and kill me.

429
01:01:14,672 --> 01:01:16,423
Oh, that's harsh.

430
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:20,010
But perhaps. Wait and see.

431
01:01:20,803 --> 01:01:23,472
Come to Venice, Via Dolorosa.

432
01:01:24,056 --> 01:01:26,433
Wonderful. Bye then.

433
01:01:30,271 --> 01:01:31,939
Harder.

434
01:01:35,484 --> 01:01:37,736
Here it comes. Hide, everybody.

435
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:40,447
Look out. It's some sort of machine.

436
01:01:41,907 --> 01:01:44,285
Bryce, it's me.

437
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:47,621
- Hello?
- Bryce, it's Lara. I found the temple.

438
01:01:48,289 --> 01:01:50,833
- Ran into Mr. Powell.
- Did you get the clock?

439
01:01:50,958 --> 01:01:53,627
No, but I got the first piece.

440
01:01:54,086 --> 01:01:55,462
Oh, beautiful, smashing.

441
01:01:55,546 --> 01:01:57,882
Seems I'm level pegging
with Mr. Powell.

442
01:01:57,965 --> 01:01:59,717
Well, won't he just want to kill you now?

443
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:00,843
No, silly.

444
01:02:00,968 --> 01:02:04,221
His problem is that he needs the piece
that I have.

445
01:02:04,305 --> 01:02:07,308
Until then, I'm his new best friend.

446
01:02:07,391 --> 01:02:09,727
What about the other half?
The final alignment

447
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:13,147
is in 66 hours and 53 minutes,
and we've still got no idea

448
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:15,900
where the second piece is hidden.

449
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:18,527
He's going to tell me
where the second piece is.

450
01:02:18,694 --> 01:02:21,947
- He will?
- Bryce, trust me. Pack for Venice.

451
01:02:22,031 --> 01:02:24,783
Pack for where? Hello? Lara?

452
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:28,954
Bye then.

453
01:02:59,026 --> 01:03:00,152
Drink.

454
01:03:03,906 --> 01:03:05,032
Rest.

455
01:03:06,992 --> 01:03:09,078
There's no rest for the wicked.

456
01:03:09,912 --> 01:03:11,956
You got what you came for?

457
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:14,291
- I did, yes.
- Too bad.

458
01:03:14,917 --> 01:03:16,543
Bad for the world.

459
01:03:17,086 --> 01:03:18,629
The world is safe now.

460
01:03:19,588 --> 01:03:22,174
Little bit safer, perhaps,

461
01:03:23,008 --> 01:03:25,219
because you will go on.

462
01:03:25,302 --> 01:03:27,805
Your father said you will never give up.

463
01:03:27,888 --> 01:03:31,392
My father? You knew my father?

464
01:03:32,643 --> 01:03:33,978
Now, drink.

465
01:03:34,269 --> 01:03:36,063
Finish your tea.

466
01:03:38,107 --> 01:03:42,361
It tastes quite bad,
but it is good for you.

467
01:03:43,445 --> 01:03:44,530
See?

468
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:25,821
Good evening.

469
01:04:29,241 --> 01:04:31,368
You're with the Illuminati.

470
01:04:34,329 --> 01:04:35,706
Beg your pardon?

471
01:04:36,123 --> 01:04:39,376
There's no such thing.
It's just a bedtime story.

472
01:04:46,842 --> 01:04:48,218
Illuminati.

473
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:51,680
The people of the light.

474
01:04:54,016 --> 01:04:56,018
Have you brought my triangle?

475
01:04:56,477 --> 01:05:00,355
No, of course you haven't.
You've hidden it somewhere.

476
01:05:01,857 --> 01:05:04,193
Well, you can keep the triangle
you have

477
01:05:04,693 --> 01:05:08,363
and I will keep your father's clock,
and we can be partners.

478
01:05:08,572 --> 01:05:10,324
Who sits here?

479
01:05:12,367 --> 01:05:14,703
We can be partners
and go for the big prize,

480
01:05:15,662 --> 01:05:17,206
the Triangle of Light.

481
01:05:17,289 --> 01:05:20,209
Yes, but who sits here?

482
01:05:21,335 --> 01:05:24,755
It's an incredible dream,
an awesome power.

483
01:05:25,506 --> 01:05:27,424
It could set right so many wrongs.

484
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:31,512
I don't think you sit here, do you?

485
01:05:42,731 --> 01:05:44,566
I sit here

486
01:05:45,526 --> 01:05:47,945
on God's right hand, as it were.

487
01:05:50,197 --> 01:05:51,323
In fact,

488
01:05:51,406 --> 01:05:55,410
I now sit exactly where your father sat.

489
01:05:59,748 --> 01:06:00,916
You're lying.

490
01:06:01,416 --> 01:06:06,004
No. No, he mentored me in the order.

491
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:09,633
It was truly an honor.

492
01:06:11,051 --> 01:06:12,594
I don't believe you.

493
01:06:14,721 --> 01:06:16,265
My father was not with the Illuminati.

494
01:06:16,348 --> 01:06:19,017
- He would have told me.
- He had a great many secrets.

495
01:06:22,771 --> 01:06:24,189
Not from me.

496
01:06:24,815 --> 01:06:26,441
Especially from you.

497
01:06:31,446 --> 01:06:33,115
I know what you want, Lara.

498
01:06:34,366 --> 01:06:35,909
Oh, I doubt it.

499
01:06:45,419 --> 01:06:47,629
Another life with your father,

500
01:06:48,672 --> 01:06:50,424
a second chance.

501
01:06:51,216 --> 01:06:53,719
It'll be within my power to give.

502
01:06:55,095 --> 01:06:57,306
The triangle gives its possessor

503
01:06:58,682 --> 01:07:00,559
the power of God,

504
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:05,814
to move back and forth through time,
undo the past.

505
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:10,944
Help me, and you will get
what I know you want,

506
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:13,530
to have your father returned to you.

507
01:07:18,118 --> 01:07:21,163
And how do I know
once I gave you that piece

508
01:07:21,413 --> 01:07:23,707
that you wouldn't then just try to kill me?

509
01:07:26,919 --> 01:07:29,379
Would it make it easier for you

510
01:07:30,005 --> 01:07:33,842
on more familiar ground,
if I killed you now?

511
01:07:36,011 --> 01:07:37,638
Will you reconsider?

512
01:08:38,782 --> 01:08:41,702
- Hello, Alex.
- I suppose you think

513
01:08:41,785 --> 01:08:43,578
I'm a greedy, unscrupulous sellout

514
01:08:43,662 --> 01:08:46,581
- and do about anything for money.
- Yes, that's right.

515
01:08:48,542 --> 01:08:50,419
Well, the money bit's true, I guess.

516
01:08:54,965 --> 01:08:56,758
Is it, Alex?

517
01:08:57,092 --> 01:09:01,096
If you cross me,
we may not be able to remain friends.

518
01:09:05,767 --> 01:09:07,311
Always a pleasure.

519
01:09:11,273 --> 01:09:12,899
Now for a cold shower.

520
01:09:14,318 --> 01:09:15,777
I think we're in big trouble.

521
01:09:15,861 --> 01:09:17,195
- Hold this, will you?
- Thank you.

522
01:09:17,446 --> 01:09:20,824
They... They already think that we have
Lady Croft's piece of the triangle.

523
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:23,869
Yes. They think it's in that box
you're carrying right now.

524
01:09:25,746 --> 01:09:26,955
Is it?

525
01:09:27,122 --> 01:09:28,874
Why don't you worry
about something else?

526
01:09:28,957 --> 01:09:30,459
Of course it's not.

527
01:09:31,251 --> 01:09:35,005
I don't understand. What chance of
success do we have without the piece?

528
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:37,591
Zero. Don't dwell on it.

529
01:09:37,674 --> 01:09:38,759
But...

530
01:09:42,846 --> 01:09:44,014
Lady Croft.

531
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:48,268
What a nice surprise.

532
01:09:50,854 --> 01:09:52,314
Thank you.

533
01:09:55,108 --> 01:09:57,986
Now, time to save
the universe again then, is it?

534
01:09:58,236 --> 01:09:59,654
Absolutely.

535
01:10:34,189 --> 01:10:36,858
Are we sure she's really necessary?

536
01:10:37,776 --> 01:10:40,987
Well, one tomb raider is good.
Two, better.

537
01:10:49,538 --> 01:10:53,041
Me bum's gone to sleep again,
all down the left cheek.

538
01:10:53,208 --> 01:10:55,627
Really? That's fascinating.

539
01:11:01,967 --> 01:11:04,052
- How much longer?
- A few hours.

540
01:11:04,553 --> 01:11:06,721
We have to take the last hour over land.

541
01:11:06,805 --> 01:11:09,307
Helicopters won't fly
near the ruined city.

542
01:11:11,101 --> 01:11:12,477
It's a dead zone.

543
01:11:54,561 --> 01:11:56,813
We take all doggies.

544
01:11:58,023 --> 01:12:00,442
Much-o U.S. greenback.

545
01:12:01,526 --> 01:12:03,028
All doggies.

546
01:12:31,264 --> 01:12:35,267
- Are you going to the ice lake?
- Yes,

547
01:12:35,268 --> 01:12:38,562
- To the crater?
- Yes, To the meteor crater,

548
01:12:38,563 --> 01:12:42,859
Don't go, You're risking everything,
To see him again,

549
01:12:44,402 --> 01:12:46,446
To see who?

550
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:48,114
Your father,

551
01:13:56,683 --> 01:13:58,351
Welcome to the dead zone.

552
01:14:13,867 --> 01:14:15,952
It's not a country. It's an ice cube!

553
01:14:19,664 --> 01:14:21,207
Come on!

554
01:15:49,963 --> 01:15:52,090
All right. Let's go.

555
01:16:45,226 --> 01:16:46,644
Go on, get it!

556
01:16:54,402 --> 01:16:55,904
Holy shit.

557
01:16:57,864 --> 01:17:02,035
It's a time storm. Time is broken here.

558
01:17:02,327 --> 01:17:05,955
We must find the eye! All of you! Hurry!

559
01:17:06,289 --> 01:17:09,209
We're running out of time! Hurry! Hurry!

560
01:17:28,645 --> 01:17:29,896
It's begun.

561
01:17:33,107 --> 01:17:35,443
$50 says the piece is inside the sun.

562
01:18:19,279 --> 01:18:23,283
For God's sake, hurry! The eclipse
will be over in a few minutes!

563
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:33,626
Alex, give me the clock.
I know what to do.

564
01:19:28,431 --> 01:19:30,016
Has she got the piece?

565
01:19:40,401 --> 01:19:41,819
We will now

566
01:19:41,903 --> 01:19:44,405
unite these two parts,

567
01:19:45,031 --> 01:19:47,700
the past and the present.

568
01:19:48,868 --> 01:19:51,913
At last, we of the Illuminati

569
01:19:52,038 --> 01:19:55,541
will control time
and fulfill the sacred promise

570
01:19:55,708 --> 01:19:57,210
to our ancestors.

571
01:19:57,877 --> 01:20:01,923
- Soon, the entire world will bow...
- Enough of this twaddle.

572
01:20:07,971 --> 01:20:09,222
Go on! Go on!

573
01:20:36,290 --> 01:20:38,626
Not quite what you hoped for,
Mr. Powell?

574
01:20:43,297 --> 01:20:44,424
Lara,

575
01:20:46,426 --> 01:20:48,594
I have a gut instinct about this.

576
01:20:50,346 --> 01:20:53,099
After all, you are the daughter
of a genius.

577
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:54,809
Let me test my theory.

578
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:49,989
You had to let him go.
No more bubbles.

579
01:21:50,823 --> 01:21:53,159
You show me
how to complete the triangle,

580
01:21:53,868 --> 01:21:55,745
we can change his fate.

581
01:21:56,996 --> 01:22:00,583
If you deliver me the power of God,
I will spare him.

582
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:03,169
It's only a little trip back in time.

583
01:22:04,003 --> 01:22:08,674
But I'm pretty sure you've figured out
the answer to the problem.

584
01:22:10,343 --> 01:22:13,846
And then, of course,
there's the loss of your father.

585
01:22:14,097 --> 01:22:15,515
I can change that.

586
01:22:30,113 --> 01:22:31,364
You'd better be ready for this.

587
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:41,040
- Unhook your laser sight.
- Do it.

588
01:23:17,952 --> 01:23:20,413
"To see a world in a grain of sand."

589
01:23:53,613 --> 01:23:54,780
Daddy?

590
01:23:59,785 --> 01:24:00,786
Lara.

591
01:24:04,123 --> 01:24:05,291
Is this real?

592
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:08,878
It is a crossing

593
01:24:10,046 --> 01:24:12,173
of my past and your present.

594
01:24:12,965 --> 01:24:15,134
Why did you not tell me
about the Illuminati?

595
01:24:15,801 --> 01:24:17,470
You were only a child.

596
01:24:17,553 --> 01:24:19,430
You could have written in your journals.

597
01:24:19,513 --> 01:24:23,476
- You never mentioned it, not once.
- Lara, I burst to tell you everything.

598
01:24:23,976 --> 01:24:26,270
But in the fierceness
of my own battles,

599
01:24:26,354 --> 01:24:29,148
I strove to tell you
only that which would inspire you

600
01:24:29,232 --> 01:24:30,816
and keep you safe.

601
01:24:32,151 --> 01:24:34,070
I love you so much.

602
01:24:35,446 --> 01:24:36,906
But I've missed you.

603
01:24:38,324 --> 01:24:40,076
And I have missed you.

604
01:24:43,329 --> 01:24:45,248
I know why you came here,

605
01:24:45,331 --> 01:24:48,584
why you took the power of the light,
but this must not happen.

606
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:52,505
Why? Why can't we use the power
just this once?

607
01:24:54,423 --> 01:24:55,967
Why can't you stay?

608
01:24:56,550 --> 01:24:59,178
We can't change time.

609
01:25:00,513 --> 01:25:02,390
But time was stolen from us

610
01:25:04,767 --> 01:25:06,269
and it's not fair.

611
01:25:06,769 --> 01:25:08,938
No, it's not fair.

612
01:25:09,981 --> 01:25:12,024
But you have stolen time itself

613
01:25:12,733 --> 01:25:15,027
and you must give it back.

614
01:25:16,821 --> 01:25:19,156
You must destroy the triangle.

615
01:25:21,284 --> 01:25:23,035
Suddenly I feel so alone.

616
01:25:24,412 --> 01:25:29,250
You're never alone. I am with you
always, just as I've always been.

617
01:26:56,629 --> 01:26:57,671
No.

618
01:27:11,936 --> 01:27:13,270
Move out!

619
01:27:22,696 --> 01:27:23,823
Lara.

620
01:27:25,658 --> 01:27:26,784
Wait!

621
01:27:28,285 --> 01:27:29,995
Your father begged for his life

622
01:27:30,079 --> 01:27:31,997
when we caught him betraying us.

623
01:27:32,081 --> 01:27:34,834
He pleaded like a baby.

624
01:27:34,917 --> 01:27:36,168
Surrender.

625
01:27:38,254 --> 01:27:39,547
Never.

626
01:27:43,050 --> 01:27:47,680
He seemed particularly concerned
that I shouldn't take this.

627
01:27:53,394 --> 01:27:56,605
Lara, no! The place is coming down!

628
01:27:56,689 --> 01:27:59,692
- This is insane!
- Get them out of here.

629
01:28:04,613 --> 01:28:05,948
You just hurry.

630
01:28:18,169 --> 01:28:19,753
There you go,

631
01:28:20,171 --> 01:28:21,589
safe and sound.

632
01:28:32,933 --> 01:28:34,185
No guns.

633
01:31:31,904 --> 01:31:33,155
Oh, my God!

634
01:31:36,158 --> 01:31:37,576
Quiet.

635
01:32:10,943 --> 01:32:12,069
What?
