1
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:27,402
Love

2
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:31,989
is a many splendoured thing

3
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,989
I'm going back to Australia,
I might never see you again.

4
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,158
Don't talk that way, Sandy.

5
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:16,826
But it's true.

6
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,580
I've just had the best summer of my life
and now I have to go away.

7
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:22,206
It isn't fair.

8
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:32,008
Danny, don't spoil it.

9
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:35,470
It's not spoiling it, Sandy,
it's only making it better.

10
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:38,181
Danny, is this the end?

11
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,516
Of course not.

12
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:42,935
It's only the beginning.

13
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,104
This is the main brain, Vince Fontaine.

14
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:47,940
Beginning your day with the only way,
music, music, music.

15
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,692
Get out of bed,
it's the first day of school.

16
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:53,029
Don't be a slob, don't get a job.
Go back to class, you can pass.

17
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,697
And to start the day off nice and fine,

18
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:57,492
l'm gonna play
a new old favourite of mine.

19
00:01:57,785 --> 00:02:00,787
l solve my problems and l see the light

20
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:03,122
We got a loving thing

21
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:05,374
We got to feed it right

22
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,796
There ain't no danger we can go too far

23
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,717
We start believing now
that we can be who we are

24
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,136
Grease is the word

25
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:23,309
They think our love
is just a growing pain

26
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,645
Why don't they understand?

27
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:28,564
It's just a crying shame

28
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:32,068
Their lips are lying, only real is real

29
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:34,487
We stop the fight right now

30
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,739
We got to be what we feel

31
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:38,324
Grease is the word

32
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,077
Is the word, is the word that you heard

33
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:44,413
It's got groove, it's got meaning

34
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,917
Grease is the time

35
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:50,753
is the place, is the motion

36
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,507
Grease is the way we are feeling

37
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:01,097
We take the pressure
and we throw away

38
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:05,810
Conventionality belongs to yesterday

39
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,856
There is a chance
that we can make it so far

40
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,402
We start believing now
that we can be who we are

41
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:15,862
Grease is the word

42
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:18,990
Is the word, is the word that you heard

43
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:22,118
It's got groove, it's got meaning

44
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,621
Grease is the time

45
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,499
is the place, is the motion

46
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:32,795
Now grease is the way we are feeling

47
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:36,173
This is a life of illusion

48
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,509
Wrapped up in troubles

49
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,303
Laced in confusion

50
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:43,806
What are we doing here

51
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:47,560
We take the pressure
and we throw away

52
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:52,356
Conventionality belongs to yesterday

53
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,527
There is a chance
that we can make it so far

54
00:03:56,653 --> 00:04:00,990
We start believing now
that we can be who we are

55
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:02,450
Grease is the word

56
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:05,786
ls the word
is the word that you heard

57
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:09,165
It's got groove, it's got meaning

58
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,460
Grease is the time

59
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:15,296
is the place, is the motion

60
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,841
Grease is the way we are feeling

61
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:37,818
Grease is the word
is the word that you've heard

62
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:40,529
It's got groove, it's got meaning

63
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:44,492
Grease is the time

64
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,994
is the place, is the motion

65
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:50,748
Grease is the way we are feeling

66
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:57,922
Grease is the word
is the word, is the word

67
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,852
You're not supposed to eat this,
you're supposed to bury it.

68
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:13,187
Hey, that's a homemade lunch.

69
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,064
Old lady drag her carcass
out of bed for you?

70
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,525
Sure, Putzie. She does it every year
on the first day of school.

71
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:18,985
Big deal.

72
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,322
-Kenickie! Over here, Kenickie.
-Kenickie.

73
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:24,407
Hey, where you at?

74
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,575
We're right here.

75
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,995
-Where were you all summer?
-What are you, my mother?

76
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,246
I'm just asking.

77
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,957
I was working, which is more than
any of youse kids can say.

78
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,542
-Working?
-That's right.

79
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:36,836
I was lugging boxes
at Bargain City, moron.

80
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,213
-Nice job.
-Eat me.

81
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,465
-I'm saving up to get me some wheels.
-Yeah?

82
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,092
-You wanna hear what I did?
-No.

83
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,969
Hey, there's Danny!

84
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:50,266
-Hey, Danny!
-Danny! Danny!

85
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,811
-Hey, hey!
-How you doing, huh?

86
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,354
Hey, Danny!

87
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:04,488
Hey, you seen any new broads
over there?

88
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:07,408
Nah, just the same old chicks
everybody's made it with.

89
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,036
Hey, so what'd you do all summer,
Danny, huh?

90
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,830
I was hanging around down the beach,
you know. You know.

91
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,833
I know what you mean, it's tough with
all those chicks hanging around you.

92
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,919
Yeah, well, the only thing that
hangs around you, Sonny, are the flies.

93
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,546
Hey, right here, Putzie, huh?

94
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,008
Hey, how was
the action at the beach, man?

95
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:28,304
-It was flipping.
-Yeah? Crazy?

96
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:32,391
I did meet this one chick.
She was sort of cool, you know.

97
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:34,685
You mean she puts out?

98
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,897
Oh, come on, Sonny,
is that all you ever think about?

99
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:39,398
Freaking A!

100
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,986
Hey, guys, wait up.

101
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,030
Do I look okay, Frenchy?

102
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:49,116
-Sure, you look good.
-I'm really nervous, you know.

103
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:52,119
-You look terrific.
-So, this is Rydell?

104
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,538
Yep, you'll love it.

105
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:58,250
I loved the last school I was at.
I wish I was there right now.

106
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:01,003
Still, I'm no stranger to heartbreak.

107
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,464
Why? You got psoriasis?

108
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,396
Oh, God.

109
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,609
Well, here we are again.

110
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,694
Yeah, but this time we're seniors.

111
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,239
And we're gonna rule the school.

112
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:33,202
-Jan, that is so adolescent.
-We are adolescent.

113
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,079
We don't have to flaunt it.

114
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,747
Okay, girls.

115
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,208
Let's go get them.

116
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,091
Blanche, do you have
the new schedules?

117
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,885
Yes, Miss McGee,
I just had my hands on them.

118
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,680
Oh, good, they'll be nice and smudged.

119
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:54,598
Oh, here we are.

120
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:57,309
If it had been a snake,
it would've bitten me.

121
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:01,230
Blanche, these are the schedules
we couldn't find for last semester.

122
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,483
Now, maybe next year,
you'll find the ones for this semester.

123
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:14,076
I've got Kenickie again.

124
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:16,120
He's been here longer than I have.

125
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:20,166
It's the first day of school
and already my castor oil is missing.

126
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:24,128
How many days till Christmas vacation?

127
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,422
-Eighty-six.
-Eighty-six?

128
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,883
-I'm counting.
-Oh.

129
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,552
-May I help you, dear?
-Oh, yes, this is my first day of school.

130
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,262
I'm not really sure
where I'm supposed to be.

131
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,181
Oh, well, welcome to Rydell.

132
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:38,267
You'll have to fill out
a few of these forms, but...

133
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,270
Will you excuse me for a minute?
I'll be right back.

134
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,815
Oh, excuse me,
do you have a pencil, please?

135
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,234
Oh, yes, dear. There you are.

136
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:59,788
Jeez. Every teacher I got this year
has flunked me at least once.

137
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,040
If you don't watch it,

138
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:03,042
you're gonna be spending all your time
in McGee's office.

139
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,211
Yeah, well, this year she's gonna wish
she'd never seen me.

140
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,213
Oh, yeah? And what are you gonna do?

141
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,797
I just ain't gonna take any of her crap.

142
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:11,217
That's all,
I don't take no crap from nobody.

143
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,802
-Sonny?
-Oh, hello, ma'am.

144
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,971
Aren't you supposed to be
in Homeroom right now?

145
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,223
I was just going for a walk.

146
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,558
-You were just dawdling, weren't you?
-Yes, ma'am.

147
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:23,395
That is no way
to start a new semester, Mr LaTierri.

148
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,816
Perhaps a session
of banging erasers after school

149
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,235
would put you on the right track.

150
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:30,653
Yes, ma'am.

151
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,655
Are you just going to
stand there all day?

152
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,740
No, ma'am. I mean, yes, ma'am.
I mean, I'm just...

153
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,992
-Well, which is it, yes or no?
-No, ma'am.

154
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,411
-Good. Then move.
-Yes, ma'am.

155
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:44,583
I'm sure glad
you didn't take any of her crap, Sonny.

156
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:46,502
You would've really told her off, huh?

157
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:49,588
"Mr LaTierri. Yes, ma'am, no, ma'am."

158
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:52,174
-Hey, Eugene.
-How you doing?

159
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:54,176
Shake, buddy.

160
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,430
Hey, what's wrong?
You're wearing glasses.

161
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,599
-I got astigmatism.
-Oh, too bad.

162
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:02,017
Come on, let's go.

163
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:08,524
As I go travelling down life's highway

164
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:12,987
Whatever course
my fortunes may foretell

165
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:21,537
Good morning, boys and girls,
and welcome to what we're sure will be

166
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,872
our greatest year at Rydell.

167
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:27,293
Saturday night will be
our first pep rally and bonfire,

168
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:31,630
and I want to see all of you students
out there with plenty of support

169
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:34,633
for Coach Calhoun
and the Rydell Rangers.

170
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,887
If you can't be an athlete,
be an athletic supporter.

171
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:42,224
And now for the really good news

172
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,810
and probably
one of the most exciting things

173
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,146
to ever happen at Rydell High.

174
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:51,984
National Bandstand television show
has selected Rydell

175
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,737
as a representative
American high school

176
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:58,824
and will do a live broadcast
from our very own gym.

177
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,744
lt is our chance to show

178
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:05,914
the entire nation what fine,
bright, clean-cut,

179
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:10,544
wholesome students
we have here at Rydell.

180
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:30,939
Hey, did you guys get a look at Zuko
this morning?

181
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,942
Looking pretty good this year,
huh, Rizz?

182
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:35,194
That's ancient history.

183
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,946
Well, history sometimes repeats itself.

184
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:40,449
-Hey, you guys.
-Hi, Frenchy.

185
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,867
-Hi, French.
-Go sit down.

186
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,870
This here is Sandy Olsson.

187
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:48,290
And that's Jan and Marty,
and this here's Rizzo.

188
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,210
She just moved here
from Sydney, Australia.

189
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,045
How are things down under?

190
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,922
Oh, fine, thanks.

191
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,386
-Hey, Marty, are those new glasses?
-Oh, yeah, just got them for school.

192
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,054
Don't you think
they make me look smarter?

193
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,556
Nah, you can still see your face.

194
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:07,059
How do you like school so far, Sandy?

195
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,977
-It's different.
-Hi, kids.

196
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:13,565
Patty Simcox,
the bad seed of Rydell High. Hi!

197
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,818
Oh, I just love the first day of school,
don't you?

198
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,236
It's the biggest thrill of my life.

199
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,821
Oh, you'll never guess what's happened.

200
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:20,072
Probably not.

201
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,990
They just announced the nominees
for Student Council

202
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,742
and guess who's up for Vice President?

203
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:25,994
-Who?
-Me. Isn't that the most?

204
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,497
-To say the least.
-The very least.

205
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,499
I just hope
I don't make too poor a showing.

206
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,835
Well, we certainly wish you
the best of luck, don't we, girls?

207
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,670
Yeah, sure. I've got my fingers crossed.

208
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,338
-Thank you.
-Here.

209
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:40,426
Oh, you must think I'm a terrible clod
for not introducing myself to your friend.

210
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,678
Hi, I'm Patty Simcox.

211
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:44,972
Welcome to Rydell.

212
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,770
Well, I hope you'll be
at cheerleader tryouts.

213
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:54,273
We'll have so much fun
and get to be lifelong friends.

214
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,942
You guys, how do you like Sandy, huh?

215
00:12:57,026 --> 00:13:00,195
Do you think we could let her in
the Pink Ladies?

216
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,781
She looks too pure to be pink.

217
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:04,450
Oh, double doo-doo!

218
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:05,784
-Please.
-What's up, Doc?

219
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:08,704
One of my diamonds
just fell in the macaroni.

220
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:12,124
Hey, Kenickie,
you want a piece of salami?

221
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,710
Are you kidding?
If I eat that, I'll smell like you.

222
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,628
What a stink!

223
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,672
Hey, guys. Guys, look.

224
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,886
Ladies and gentlemen,
dingleberries on parade!

225
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,179
Yeah.

226
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:29,475
Hey, look! You really put your foot
into it this time, Chisum.

227
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:32,144
Try hopscotch, you hot dog!

228
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:35,898
-What a gavone.
-Gumdrops, man.

229
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,737
Hey, any of you guys
see that new chick at registration?

230
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:45,073
Oh, she sure beats the foam domes
around here.

231
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,992
You mean herjugs
were bigger than Annette's?

232
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,328
Nobody's jugs
are bigger than Annette's.

233
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:50,662
Right.

234
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,043
Hey, guys.

235
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:57,920
Hey!

236
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,757
Hi, girls.

237
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,593
-You're a sick man, Putz.
-Hey!

238
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,515
Hey, I wanna hear about
what Danny did at the beach.

239
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,016
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

240
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,267
Nah, it was nothing.

241
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,686
-Sure, nothing, Zuko. Right?
-Come on, Danny.

242
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,021
You got in her drawers, right?

243
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,106
Yeah, come on, come on.
Tell us about that girl.

244
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,108
What'd you do this summer, Sandy?

245
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:23,362
Oh, I spent most of it at the beach.
I met a boy there.

246
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:26,114
Hauled your cookies
all the way to the beach for some guy?

247
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,200
Well, he was sort of special.

248
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,452
There ain't no such thing.

249
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,287
He was really romantic.

250
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,456
-Everything about it.
-Come on, man.

251
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,792
Come on, you don't want to hear
all the horny details.

252
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:37,960
Are you kidding me!

253
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:39,628
All right! I'll tell you.

254
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:43,465
Summer lovin'
Had me a blast

255
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:47,386
Summer lovin'
Happened so fast

256
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:51,056
I met a girl crazy for me

257
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:54,643
Met a boy cute as can be

258
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:58,480
Summer days drifting away

259
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:01,233
To uh-oh those summer nights

260
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,151
Well-a well-a well-a huh!

261
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:05,237
Tell me more, tell me more

262
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,989
Didja get very far?

263
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:08,657
Tell me more, tell me more

264
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,492
Like does he have a car?

265
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:14,913
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo,
doo-doo doo-doo-doo

266
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:18,333
She swam by me, she got a cramp

267
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:22,254
He ran by me, got my suit damp

268
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:26,425
I saved her life, she nearly drowned

269
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:29,928
He showed off, splashing around

270
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:33,348
Summer sun, something's begun

271
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:36,018
But uh-oh those summer nights

272
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:38,103
Well-a well-a well-a huh!

273
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,105
Tell me more, tell me more

274
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,024
Was it love at first sight?

275
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,026
Tell me more, tell me more

276
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,777
Did she put up a fight?

277
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:49,364
Dam, doo-bee-doo, doo-bee-doo,
doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-bee

278
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:53,702
Dam, doo-bee-doo, doo-bee-doo,
doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-bee-dam

279
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:57,080
Took her bowling in the arcade

280
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:01,251
We went strolling, drank lemonade

281
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:04,963
We made out under the dock

282
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:08,592
We stayed out till ten o'clock

283
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:12,137
Summer fling, don't mean a thing

284
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:16,642
But uh-oh those summer nights

285
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,810
Tell me more, tell me more

286
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:20,687
But ya don't gotta brag

287
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:23,023
Tell me more, tell me more

288
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,900
'Cause he sounds like a drag

289
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,029
Shoo-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop,
shoo-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop

290
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,657
Shoo-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop,
shoo-bop-bop

291
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,241
Yeah

292
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:36,953
He got friendly holding my hand

293
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,041
She got friendly down in the sand

294
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,795
He was sweet, just turned eighteen

295
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:46,338
Well, she was good

296
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,715
Ya know what l mean

297
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,802
Summer heat, boy and girl meet

298
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:55,764
But uh-oh those summer nights

299
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:58,642
Tell me more, tell me more

300
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:00,602
How much dough did he spend?

301
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,562
Tell me more, tell me more

302
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,940
Could she get me a friend?

303
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,611
lt turned colder

304
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,322
That's where it ends

305
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:17,577
So l told her we'd still be friends

306
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:23,250
Then we made our true love vow

307
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:29,631
Wonder what she's doing now

308
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,554
Summer dreams

309
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:40,183
ripped at the seams

310
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:44,312
But uh-oh

311
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,527
those summer

312
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,407
nights

313
00:17:55,491 --> 00:18:00,662
Tell me more, tell me more

314
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,797
He sounds real nice.

315
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,883
True love
and he didn't lay a hand on you?

316
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,426
Sounds like a creep to me.

317
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,887
Well, he wasn't. He was a gentleman.

318
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,889
Hey, what was his name?

319
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:21,183
Danny. Danny Zuko.

320
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:26,062
Well, I think he sounds peachy keen.

321
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:28,774
Well, maybe, if you believe in miracles,

322
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:31,568
Prince Charming
will show up again someday.

323
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:33,487
Somewhere unexpected.

324
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:35,447
See you later.

325
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,199
Come on, girls.

326
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,077
Do you really think so, Frenchy?

327
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:43,205
-Sure.
-Yeah?

328
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,708
Sandy, I think we ought to get to class.

329
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,773
Do the splits, give a yell!

330
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:11,817
Show a little spirit for old Rydell!

331
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:14,110
Way to go, red and white!

332
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:16,738
Go Rydell, fight, fight, fight!

333
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:26,581
And now...

334
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,709
Quiet, please.

335
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:36,800
Quiet, everyone. And now,
boys and girls, the man of the hour.

336
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,844
The coach we're all depending on

337
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:42,514
to pull Rydell out of
the seven-season slump,

338
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,433
our very own Coach Calhoun.

339
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,152
Who's the best?

340
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:57,571
Rydell!

341
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:02,284
Give them hell, Rydell!

342
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:07,998
I just wanna tell you students
that we have a banner year coming up,

343
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,541
a banner year.

344
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,209
Because my boys are primed.

345
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:14,629
I mean really primed
because I primed them.

346
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:17,173
I mean, they're not only primed,
they're honed.

347
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,926
Honed to a sharp razor-edge.

348
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,554
And we're not
just going out there to win,

349
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,181
we're going out there for glory.

350
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:27,058
When we get out there,

351
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:31,104
we're gonna yank them
and tear them and rip them!

352
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:34,107
We're gonna take them
and roll them around

353
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,484
and rip them up to pieces!

354
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:39,237
And then we're gonna slaughter them.

355
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:43,325
And after the slaughter is over,
we're gonna come back here

356
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,161
and ring that victory bell.

357
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,498
Like we always wanted to.

358
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,481
Hey, Dan, watch this.

359
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:20,528
Do a split, give a yell,
shake a tit for old Rydell!

360
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,034
Guys.

361
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:28,662
Be cool, huh?

362
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:32,999
Hey, watch out, pinhead.

363
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,422
Well, what do you think?

364
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:42,217
What a hunk ofjunk.

365
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:45,136
Wait till I give it a paint job
and soup up the engine, man.

366
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,180
She's gonna run like a champ.

367
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,057
I'm racing her at Thunder Road.

368
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:50,392
Thunder Road?

369
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:52,352
Yeah. You wanna make something of it?

370
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:55,563
I wanna see you
make something of this heap.

371
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,983
You're cruising for a bruising.

372
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:01,903
Hey, what're the Scorpions doing here?
This ain't their turf.

373
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,699
Think they wanna rumble?

374
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:08,451
Yeah, if they do,
we're gonna be ready for them.

375
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:18,086
All right, gang! Let's go get them!

376
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,805
Hey, chick.

377
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:30,724
What you doing?

378
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,144
-Oh, thanks, Frenchy.
-That's all right.

379
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,229
You know something?
You were really great out there.

380
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,273
No, I really messed up,
I was so nervous.

381
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:40,775
Oh, no. Your split was divoon.

382
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,361
-Hi, Sandy.
-Oh, hi, Rizz. Hi, girls.

383
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:45,655
-We got a surprise for you.
-Surprise? What is it?

384
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,282
You'll see. Right, Rizz?

385
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:49,576
Hey, just let me comb
your hair down a little bit here.

386
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,286
Where are we going?

387
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:53,163
Want a little lipstick?

388
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:57,584
You know, if we fix up this car, it
could be make-out city, you know that?

389
00:22:57,668 --> 00:23:00,962
Right, a chick is gonna have to put out
before she even gets in.

390
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,505
You'd better believe it, man.

391
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:05,467
Hey, Zuko. I got a surprise for you.

392
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,135
Oh, yeah?

393
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:09,304
Yeah.

394
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:12,640
Sandy!

395
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:14,392
Danny?

396
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:18,063
What are you doing here? I thought
you were going back to Australia.

397
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:20,148
We had a change of plan.

398
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:21,649
I can't...

399
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:26,488
That's cool, baby.
I mean, you know how it is.

400
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:28,364
Rocking and rolling and whatnot.

401
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:31,326
-Danny?
-That's my name, don't wear it out.

402
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:32,744
What's the matter with you?

403
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:36,664
What's the matter with me, baby?
What's the matter with you?

404
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,252
What happened to the Danny Zuko
I met at the beach?

405
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:45,715
Well, I do not know.
I mean, maybe there's two of us, right?

406
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:50,053
Why don't you take out
a missing-persons ad,

407
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:52,847
or try the Yellow Pages? I don't know.

408
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:58,228
You're a fake and a phoney
and I wish I'd never laid eyes on you.

409
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,358
-I wonder if she carries silver bullets.
-Yeah.

410
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:08,530
So she laid her eyes on you,
huh, Zuko?

411
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:11,407
Hey, I bet that's not all
she's laid on him.

412
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:14,619
-Yeah, right.
-Hey, Zuk! I got a car, remember?

413
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,247
-Come on, Danny.
-All right, who's got beer money?

414
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:19,249
-Well, I swiped my brother's ID.
-I got $2.50.

415
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,084
All right, give me that.

416
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:27,048
He was so nice to me this summer.

417
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:30,718
Listen, Sandy, men are rats.

418
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:35,557
Listen to me. They're fleas on rats.

419
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:39,727
Worse than that,
they're amoebas on fleas on rats.

420
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:43,565
I mean, they're too low
for even the dogs to bite.

421
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:47,902
The only man a girl can depend on
is her daddy.

422
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:51,447
-You know what you need?
-What?

423
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:54,284
A night out with the girls. Huh?

424
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:58,580
We're having a sleepover
at my house tonight. Wanna come?

425
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,916
Good. You'll love it. Come on.

426
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,378
Hey, look, it's Jan.

427
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,756
Brush-a, brush-a, brush-a
Get the new lpana

428
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:12,010
With the brand-new flavour
It's dandy for your teeth

429
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:15,346
Brush-a, brush-a, brush-a
New Ipana toothpaste

430
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:19,267
Brush-a, brush-a, brush-a
Knocks out decay germs fast

431
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,895
Fast, fast, you sure are right

432
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,272
Turn it off.

433
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:27,692
-Hey. Hey, hand me a ciggie butt.
-Oh, me, too. Over here.

434
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:30,111
-Hey, you want one, Sandy?
-No, thanks, I don't smoke.

435
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:33,198
-You don't?
-Go ahead, try it. It won't kill you.

436
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:35,241
Give her a Hit Parade.

437
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:43,458
Oh, I forgot to tell you, you shouldn't
inhale unless you're used to it.

438
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:46,252
Sandy, let me teach you
how to French inhale.

439
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:48,463
It's really cool, watch.

440
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:55,011
God! That is the ugliest looking thing
I ever saw.

441
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:57,430
Nah, the guys really go for it.

442
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,515
And that's how I got my nickname,
Frenchy.

443
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:01,142
Sure it is.

444
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,478
-Oh.
-Okay.

445
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:07,440
Okay, how about a little Sneaky Pete
to get the party going?

446
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,778
Italian Swiss Colony?
Wow, it's imported.

447
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:14,405
Hey, I brought some Twinkies.
Anybody want one?

448
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:17,158
Twinkies and wine?
Oh, that's real class, Jan.

449
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:20,370
It says right here it is a dessert wine.

450
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:23,289
Hey, Sandy didn't get any wine.

451
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:24,791
Oh, that's okay.

452
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:27,085
I bet you never had
a drink before either.

453
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:29,921
Oh, yes, I did. I had some champagne
at my cousin's wedding once.

454
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,798
Ring-a-ding-ding!

455
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:34,467
What's wrong? We don't got cooties.

456
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:41,349
Hey, Sandy, would you like me
to pierce your ears for you?

457
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,394
Shut up!

458
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:48,231
-Quiet.
-Isn't that awfully dangerous?

459
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:51,693
Oh, no. I know what I'm doing.
I'm gonna be a beautician, you know.

460
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:54,362
-What's the matter? You afraid?
-No, I'm not.

461
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:56,239
Here, Frenchy,
you can use my virgin pin.

462
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:58,283
Yeah, it's nice to know
it's good for something.

463
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,784
-It's perfect.
-Frenchy, I really don't think

464
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:00,994
it's a good idea.

465
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:04,497
-Oh, no, it's okay. Listen...
-My father won't like it. I promise you...

466
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:07,750
Sandy, why don't we
go into the bathroom?

467
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,336
My mother'll kill me
if I get blood all over the carpet.

468
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:12,547
-What?
-It only bleeds for a second.

469
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:14,424
Frenchy, I don't feel very well.

470
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,301
Don't worry about it, Sandy.
If she screws up,

471
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:19,095
she can always fix your hair
so your ears don't show.

472
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:24,058
Sandy, Sandy, beauty is pain.

473
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:28,521
Could you please get me some ice
to numb her ear lobes?

474
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:33,026
Why don't you just let the cold water run
and stick her ear under the faucet?

475
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,701
Personally, I'm getting rather chilly.

476
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:44,829
-Hey, what's that?
-From Bobby in Korea.

477
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:48,082
-Are you going with a Korean?
-Dummy, he's a Marine.

478
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,751
-A Marine?
-A Marine?

479
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,545
Wanna see a picture?

480
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:56,549
God.
You're turning into a one-woman USO.

481
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,012
Hey, you guys, Sandy's sick.

482
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:04,390
I just did one ear.
She saw the blood and...

483
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:07,060
You ain't getting your hands on my ears.

484
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:08,853
Oh, yeah? Well, you'll be sorry

485
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,731
because I have been accepted
to La Cafury Beauty School.

486
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,733
You mean
you're dropping out of Rydell?

487
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,693
Hey, I don't look at it as dropping out.

488
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:18,654
I look at it
as a very strategic career move.

489
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:23,117
-Why's it torn in half?
-His old girlfriend was in the picture.

490
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:30,333
Sandy, here's your toothbrush.

491
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:34,462
Oh, thanks, Frenchy.
I'm sorry to be so much trouble.

492
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:37,298
It's okay.

493
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:41,636
Miss Goody Two-Shoes
makes me wanna barf.

494
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:46,182
Look at me, l'm Sandra Dee

495
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:49,977
Lousy with virginity

496
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:53,898
Won't go to bed till I'm legally wed

497
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,943
l can't, l'm Sandra Dee

498
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,278
Watch it

499
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:01,531
Hey, I'm Doris Day

500
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:05,451
I was not brought up that way

501
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:07,078
Won't come across

502
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:09,247
Even Rock Hudson lost

503
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:14,460
his heart to Doris Day

504
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:17,380
l don't drink or swear

505
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:19,424
I don't rat my hair

506
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:21,843
I get ill from one cigarette

507
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:26,722
Keep your filthy paws
off my silky drawers

508
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:29,517
Would you pull that crap
with Annette?

509
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:36,023
As for you, Troy Donahue

510
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:39,694
I know what you wanna do

511
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,571
You got your crust

512
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:43,781
I'm no object of lust

513
00:29:43,866 --> 00:29:47,201
l'm just plain Sandra Dee

514
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:52,373
Elvis! Elvis! Let me be

515
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:55,376
Keep that pelvis far from me

516
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,378
Just keep your cool

517
00:29:57,504 --> 00:30:00,256
Now you're starting to drool

518
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,759
Hey, Fongool

519
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,053
l'm Sandra Dee

520
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:14,604
You're making fun of me, Rizz?

521
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,691
Some people are so touchy.

522
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,197
'Cause when the wind
was blowing my way

523
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:26,657
It smelled just like the halls
of old Rydell

524
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:29,160
And if you got to use a toilet

525
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,786
and later on they start
to scratch like hell

526
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:32,580
Will you shut up, you vultures?

527
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:34,332
Hey, I changed my mind.
Let's get out of here.

528
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:37,251
-Hey, what do you mean?
-What do you mean, what do I mean?

529
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:41,714
They can't come in here. My folks'll flip.

530
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:44,175
-Hey, Putzie, why don't you call her?
-Come on. Let's get out of here.

531
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:47,220
"Oh, Sandy.
Wherefore art thou, Sandy?"

532
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:49,263
-Shut up! Sit down.
-Come on, let's go.

533
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:52,975
You goody-goodies
are too much for me.

534
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:57,063
I'm gonna get my kicks
while I'm still young enough to get them.

535
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:59,857
What's she gonna do,
shimmy down the drainpipe?

536
00:30:59,942 --> 00:31:01,901
Hey, look. There's Rizzo.

537
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:04,445
Hey, Rizzo, you're doing that
without a net.

538
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,330
Swell bunch you are,
rushing to help a lady.

539
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:17,166
-Lady? I don't see a lady.
-Shut up. Shut up!

540
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:20,503
-What's up, Kenick?
-One guess.

541
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:24,674
-You got a lot to offer a girl.
-Yeah, you know it.

542
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,093
What say you, Zuk?

543
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:30,221
You're looking good, Rizz.

544
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:34,141
-Eat your heart out.
-Well, sloppy seconds ain't my style.

545
00:31:39,982 --> 00:31:42,358
Where are you going? To flog your log?

546
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:46,487
Well, it's better than
hanging around with you dorks.

547
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,155
-Hey, Danny!
-Hey, Danny!

548
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:50,700
Your chariot, my lady.

549
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:04,589
I don't know what I ever saw
in Danny Zuko.

550
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:07,341
Don't sweat it, honey. Have one of mine.

551
00:32:09,011 --> 00:32:11,387
-There's so many of them.
-I know.

552
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:14,473
-How do you keep up with all of them?
-I'm a terrific pen pal.

553
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:17,018
Hopelessly devoted
to each and every one.

554
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:28,195
-Hey, what are you doing?
-Okay.

555
00:32:28,322 --> 00:32:30,448
So what do you guys
think this is, a gangbang?

556
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:31,907
You wish.

557
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:35,911
-Hey, hit the pavement.
-You got to be kidding.

558
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:37,622
-I said now!
-All right, all right.

559
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:39,248
-Move it!
-Remember us in your will.

560
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,334
-Your will, all right.
-Come here.

561
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:49,216
When a guy picks a chick over
his buddies, something got to be wrong.

562
00:32:49,343 --> 00:32:50,426
You said it.

563
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:53,220
Come on, guys,
let's go for a slice of pizza.

564
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:56,891
Can I have some of that?

565
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:58,726
Sure.

566
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:02,063
-Thanks.
-Wait.

567
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:27,421
Guess mine is not
the first heart broken

568
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:33,803
My eyes are not the first to cry

569
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:38,224
l'm not the first to know

570
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:43,270
There's just no getting over you

571
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:53,280
You know I'm just a fool who's willing

572
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:59,912
To sit around and wait for you

573
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:03,958
But, baby, can't you see

574
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:09,255
There's nothing else for me to do?

575
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:16,095
I'm hopelessly devoted to you

576
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:23,561
But now there's nowhere to hide

577
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:26,897
Since you pushed my love aside

578
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:30,484
I'm out of my head

579
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:52,339
Hopelessly devoted to you

580
00:34:56,845 --> 00:35:02,016
My head is saying, "Fool, forget him"

581
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:08,189
My heart is saying, "Don't let go

582
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:13,027
"Hold on to the end"

583
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:17,490
And that's what l intend to do

584
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:24,789
I'm hopelessly devoted to you

585
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:31,962
But now there's nowhere to hide

586
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:35,299
Since you pushed my love aside

587
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:39,136
I'm out of my head

588
00:35:39,221 --> 00:36:00,407
Hopelessly devoted to you

589
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:13,337
Is acne ruining your life?

590
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,756
Do you close your eyes
when you look in the mirror?

591
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:17,007
Fear no more.

592
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:21,178
Face up to Face-Off, for deep
penetration into infected pores.

593
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:24,348
Help dry up the unsightly pimples
and blemishes...

594
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:43,367
-Rizz. Rizz.
-Could you call me by my first name?

595
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:46,453
-Oh...
-Betty.

596
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:48,622
-Betty.
-Betty. Betty. Betty.

597
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,791
Oh, Betty. Betty.

598
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:52,626
Betty.

599
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,464
Have you got something?

600
00:36:57,883 --> 00:36:59,466
Are you kidding?

601
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:10,144
-My 25 cent insurance policy.
-Big spender.

602
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:15,900
-What?
-It broke.

603
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,402
How could it break?

604
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:21,614
I bought it
when I was in the seventh grade.

605
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,174
What the hell?

606
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:49,850
Hey, what the hell
you think you're doing?

607
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:52,770
You parked in a no-parking zone, creep.

608
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:55,940
The whole place
is a no-parking zone, crater-face.

609
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:58,150
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah!

610
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:04,949
You're gonna pay for that.

611
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:09,286
Yeah, well, I'll give you 75 cents for
the whole car, including your chick.

612
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,382
We just got to bang out the dent,
that's all there is to it.

613
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:22,716
The problem isn't in the dent,

614
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:25,219
the problem's
in this rubber-band engine.

615
00:38:25,345 --> 00:38:26,804
The problem's in your mouth.

616
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:28,973
Yeah, and where you gonna get
a new carburettor, huh?

617
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:33,352
-You ever heard of borrowing?
-Kenickie, you got any Scotch tape?

618
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:36,313
Hey, big stuff. What do you drive, huh?

619
00:38:36,398 --> 00:38:38,816
-I drive.
-Yeah? How about you?

620
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,484
-Who, me?
-Yeah.

621
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,319
Well, what about Doody?

622
00:38:42,404 --> 00:38:44,989
-Well, hey, I...
-That's what I thought.

623
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:46,407
Now come on, guys.

624
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:50,077
Now, this car could be a major piece
of machinery, you know that?

625
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:52,329
Look at this.

626
00:38:52,706 --> 00:38:55,040
Why, this car could be systematic.

627
00:38:56,418 --> 00:38:58,085
Hydromatic.

628
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,587
Ultramatic.

629
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:03,841
Why, it could be Greased Lightning.

630
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:05,342
Greased Lightnin'!

631
00:39:05,427 --> 00:39:09,013
We'll get some overhead lifters
and four barrel quads, oh, yeah

632
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:11,432
Keep talkin'
Wooh, keep talking

633
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:14,852
With fuel injection cut-off
and chrome plated rods, oh, yeah

634
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:17,354
We'll get it ready
I'll kill to get it ready

635
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:20,441
With a four-speed on the floor
they'll be waitin' at the door

636
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:21,942
You know that ain't no shit

637
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:24,361
We'll be getting lotsa tit
in Greased Lightnin'

638
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:26,780
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go

639
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:30,034
Go, Greased Lightnin'

643
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,960

The chicks'll cream

645
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,548
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go

646
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:48,761
We'll get some purple French taillights
and thirty inch fins, oh, yeah

647
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:54,433
A palomino dashboard
and dual muffler twins, oh, yeah

648
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:59,396
With new pistons, plugs and shocks
I can get off my rocks

649
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:01,065
You know that I ain't braggin'

650
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:03,567
She's a real pussy wagon
Greased Lightnin'

651
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,652
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go

652
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:09,073
Go, Greased Lightnin'

Lightnin'

667
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,232
-Come on, guys. Let's get to work.
-Yeah.

668
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:27,753
Hey, Zuk, man.
Those Scorpions, they're asking for it.

669
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,049
Danny, what's up?
You still thinking about that chick?

670
00:42:32,634 --> 00:42:35,552
-What are you, nuts?
-Well, no. I was just thinking.

671
00:42:35,637 --> 00:42:38,305
-Get in there. Don't think so much.
-No, that's cool, that's cool.

672
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:42,893
Hey, guys.

673
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:46,980
-Hey, Kenickie, Zuko.
-How's it hanging, huh?

674
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:49,983
Okay, the meeting is in session.

675
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:53,820
-You know what I heard?
-What?

676
00:42:53,947 --> 00:42:56,323
Last year the fuzz
had Thunder Road staked out,

677
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,283
and everybody got hauled to the clink.

678
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:01,411
So? Nobody's gonna catch
Greased Lightning.

679
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:03,121
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

680
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,500
Somebody snaking you, Danny?

681
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:09,670
-Oh, bite the weenie, Rizz.
-With relish.

682
00:43:14,676 --> 00:43:18,845
-I don't know about these chicks.
-Yeah, they're only good for one thing.

683
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,681
Then what are you
supposed to do with them

684
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:23,767
for the other 23 hours
and 45 minutes of the day?

685
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:26,103
Is that all it only takes, 1 5 minutes?

686
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:31,692
-Want some new music?
-Yeah.

687
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,986
I need some money.

688
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:37,698
Thanks.

689
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,373
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

690
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:53,297
Hi, Danny!

691
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:57,718
-I can't talk to you right now.
-Listen, what are you doing later?

692
00:43:57,802 --> 00:44:00,387
-I can't talk, all right?
-Call me.

693
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:13,317
-Hi, Sandy.
-Oh, hi.

694
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:15,485
-How are you?
-Fine, thanks.

695
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:16,570
That's good.

696
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:20,824
Hey, Sandy, I've been wanting
to talk to you for a long time now.

697
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:23,744
-What about?
-Well, about that night at the bonfire.

698
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:26,330
I mean, the way I acted,
that was terrible.

699
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:29,082
I mean, it really was. I mean,
it wasn't me, you got to know that.

700
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:32,419
I mean, it was me, of course,
but it wasn't me.

701
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:37,007
You see, Sandy, I got this image, right?
I got this...

702
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:40,344
Well, that's why I'm so glad
that Tom's such a simple person.

703
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:48,226
Simple's right.
Too bad his brains are in his biceps.

704
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,771
Jealous, are you?

705
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:55,525
Jealous? Oh, come on, Sandy,
don't make me laugh.

706
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,695
And what have you ever done?

707
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:05,285
Oh, come on!
I can run circles around those jerks.

708
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:07,621
I'll believe that when I see it.

709
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:35,148
Let's start with the first rule.
Cut it down to two packs a day, huh?

710
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:36,441
There we go.

711
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:43,240
Now, what sort of athletics
are you interested in, huh?

712
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:44,908
You like the rings?

713
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:47,911
Yeah, I installed a set of rings
just a couple of weeks ago.

714
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:54,167
Well, the first thing we have to do
is you have to change.

715
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,503
Well, I know. That's why I'm here,
you know, to change.

716
00:45:56,629 --> 00:45:59,172
-No, I mean your clothes.
-Oh.

717
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:08,098
All right, let's knock it off.

718
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:11,101
Fellows, I wanna introduce a new man.

719
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:14,187
Danny. Let's give him a tryout, huh?

720
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:17,691
You better watch it.

721
00:46:17,817 --> 00:46:20,777
All right, come on, come on, come on.
A little fire, come on, here we go.

722
00:46:20,862 --> 00:46:22,362
-Come on, come on.
-Hey, Danny.

723
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:36,001
You have to dribble.

724
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:41,965
-Here you go, Coach.
-Thank you, son.

725
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:44,217
Now, just dribble the ball,
put it in the basket.

726
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:46,803
-Think you can do that?
-Can I do that!

727
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:48,722
-Okay.
-Let's go.

728
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:50,640
Danny, over here. Danny!

729
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:52,142
Let's go.

730
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:54,144
-Come on, Arnold.
-Come on, get it up.

731
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,897
Get it up there.
Hey, that's it. Go, go, go.

732
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,648
Get him, Danny. Get him.

733
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:02,235
There we are. Go, go. Get him.
That's it. That's it. That's it.

734
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:05,655
What'd I do?

735
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:08,033
-Is he kidding?
-Boy, oh, boy.

736
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:13,830
I want you to meet
your wrestling partner.

737
00:47:13,915 --> 00:47:16,208
Danny, Andy.

738
00:47:17,877 --> 00:47:20,420
-Are you crazy?
-Come on, come on, come on.

739
00:47:20,505 --> 00:47:23,173
All right, come on, let's start.
Let's get into first position.

740
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,091
Danny, you get down.

741
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,094
Okay, Andy, get down. Ready?

742
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:29,679
Okay?

743
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:35,185
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

744
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:38,772
Danny, you gotta try. You gotta try.
Try, come on.

745
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,273
Come on, let's get down.

746
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:43,360
All right, Andy, let's change positions.
You get down. Come on.

747
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:50,534
All right. Ready?

748
00:47:53,955 --> 00:47:55,872
-Give?
-Yeah, I give.

749
00:47:55,957 --> 00:47:57,207
Good.

750
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:03,588
He's a hitter.

751
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:10,637
I think you're gonna like baseball.
It's not that much of a contact sport.

752
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:13,390
Now, get in there and let's see
what you can do, all right?

753
00:48:13,474 --> 00:48:15,308
Throw the ball. Come on. Let's play.

754
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:16,810
Hey, where would you like it, huh?

755
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:18,812
Come on, man.
Let's pitch this guy out here.

756
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:21,648
-He can't hit.
-This boy can't even bat.

757
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:24,651
-Strike.
-See? I told you. He doesn't even swing.

758
00:48:24,944 --> 00:48:28,738
What kind of ball player are you?
Come on. Put it in here, Pitcher.

759
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:31,658
Strike.

760
00:48:32,994 --> 00:48:34,744
Come on, a little pepper, a little fire.

761
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:37,664
Come on, a little fire in there.
Come on, come on. Let's see you hit it.

762
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:39,499
Put it in, put it in, put it in.

763
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,794
Foul ball.

764
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:48,174
-Easy, easy, easy.
-Now! Come on! Come on!

765
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:50,468
Put the bat down. Put the bat down!

766
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:55,682
Now, there's a lot of other sports
that don't have any contact at all.

767
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:58,351
-Oh, yeah, like what?
-Like track.

768
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:02,314
-What do you mean, running?
-What, you mean just like running?

769
00:49:03,024 --> 00:49:05,442
I mean something
that needs endurance.

770
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:09,863
Something that needs stamina.
Like, long-distance running.

771
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:12,490
Cross-country running.

772
00:49:15,036 --> 00:49:17,329
-That could be cool.
-Good.

773
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:23,043
Hey, cut it.
Come on, keep those legs high.

774
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:26,129
Take 1 0 laps.

775
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:45,565
Danny.

776
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:51,863
Danny, are you all right?

777
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:55,533
Danny, talk to me.

778
00:49:57,078 --> 00:50:00,330
The least you can do is talk to me
after the way you treated me.

779
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:03,249
The way I treated...
Sandy, I told you I was sorry about that.

780
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:04,751
Got you talking.

781
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:09,214
-You sure you're okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

782
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:14,010
-So, still going out with that jockstrap?
-Well...

783
00:50:15,096 --> 00:50:19,099
-Well, is he taking you to the dance?
-Well, that all depends.

784
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:20,767
-On what?
-On you.

785
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:22,435
-On me?
-Yeah.

786
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:25,188
He can stag it.

787
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:31,486
Come on.

788
00:50:43,499 --> 00:50:46,042
Sandy, come on,
let's go someplace else tonight.

789
00:50:46,127 --> 00:50:47,460
Why?

790
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:51,297
Because we can't be alone here,
that's why.

791
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:52,590
Danny.

792
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:55,969
Okay.

793
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:00,265
Two burgers and a moo-juice,
coming up.

794
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:06,229
You nearly pulled my arm
out of the socket.

795
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:09,566
Well, I didn't want to miss this table.
It's the best table they got.

796
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:11,609
What are you doing?

797
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:13,695
I just want a little privacy for us,
all right?

798
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:17,157
-What'll it be, kids?
-Oh, a cherry soda, please.

799
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:19,242
-Danny?
-Oh, I'm not very hungry.

800
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,828
Just give me a double polar burger
with everything

801
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,747
and a cherry soda
with chocolate ice cream.

802
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:25,915
That sounds good. I'll have the same.

803
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,209
The same? You can eat a lot, can't you?

804
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:30,712
-You know, you're funny.
-No, you are.

805
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:34,007
How you doing, Zuk, huh? Nice?
Golden glooms.

806
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:37,135
-Hi, Rizzo. How are you?
-Peachy keen, jelly bean.

807
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:41,097
Hey, you got a couple of quarters?
We can split an Eskimo Pie.

808
00:51:41,182 --> 00:51:45,435
-My Dutch treat days are over.
-You plan on staying home a lot.

809
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,812
Hey, greetings, pals and gals.

810
00:51:47,897 --> 00:51:51,775
Hey, I got 23 cents. Anybody wanna
chip in for a Dog-Sled Delight?

811
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:54,110
I don't know where all my money goes.

812
00:51:54,195 --> 00:51:56,154
A dime here, 1 5 cents there.

813
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:57,572
Yeah, well, in another couple of months,

814
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:59,616
Frenchy here will be able
to take us all out. Huh?

815
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,409
-A working girl with income.
-Hey, that's right.

816
00:52:01,494 --> 00:52:04,287
Well, you know, they don't pay
you very much to start off with.

817
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:06,080
Yeah, well, that's still more
than we make.

818
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:08,792
So ante up because
I don't get my allowance until Friday.

819
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:11,169
-What? You get an allowance?
-When I'm a good boy I do.

820
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:14,005
Hey, Viola, a Dog-Sled Delight
with four spoons.

821
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:17,008
-And an Eskimo Pie with a knife.
-Hi, gang.

822
00:52:18,928 --> 00:52:21,346
Here you are. Grab it and growl.

823
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:28,102
I got so many hickeys
people will think I'm a leper.

824
00:52:28,187 --> 00:52:32,065
Hey, cheer up. A hickey from Kenickie
is like a Hallmark card.

825
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:34,734
"When you care enough
to send the very best."

826
00:52:35,945 --> 00:52:37,403
You pig.

827
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:39,823
I love it when you talk dirty.

828
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:44,244
My parents want to invite you over to
tea on Sunday. Do you wanna come?

829
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:48,915
-I don't like tea.
-You don't have to drink tea.

830
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:51,835
Well, I don't like parents.

831
00:52:53,963 --> 00:52:55,380
Want some?

832
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:58,633
You sure are a cheap date.

833
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:00,593
Oh, I didn't mean it the way it came out.

834
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:01,886
I understand.

835
00:53:01,971 --> 00:53:04,138
I always thought you were
a very understanding person.

836
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:05,431
I am.

837
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:09,185
And I also think
that there's more to you than just fat.

838
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,770
Thanks.

839
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:12,397
You're welcome.

840
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:14,399
-You got a date for the dance-off?
-No.

841
00:53:14,483 --> 00:53:16,109
-Wanna go?
-Yeah.

842
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,111
Oh, no, I'm gonna be a senior forever

843
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,488
if I don't study
for that dumb algebra test tomorrow.

844
00:53:20,573 --> 00:53:23,157
Hey, you're in luck, luscious.
You got an armed escort home.

845
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:26,202
It's not the arms
I'm worried about, Sonny.

846
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:27,829
It's the hands.

847
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:29,414
She loves me.

848
00:53:32,084 --> 00:53:34,419
-Hey, you coming, French?
-Oh, I don't think so.

849
00:53:34,503 --> 00:53:36,546
I think I'd like to hang out
a little bit longer.

850
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:37,755
All right.

851
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,174
I have been dieting all day long.

852
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:42,677
My mom's apple pie
is better than this stuff.

853
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:45,054
-Do you want a piece?
-Yeah, sure.

854
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:47,432
-Hey, Putzie.
-Yeah?

855
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:49,183
Fifteen minutes.

856
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:52,645
You know, Danny,
I'm kind of worried about this dance-off.

857
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:55,023
Maybe they dance differently
than we do back home.

858
00:53:55,107 --> 00:53:58,276
Don't worry about it.
Maybe we'll invent the Kangaroo Bop.

859
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:02,363
Come on, let's get out of here, Sandy.

860
00:54:02,448 --> 00:54:04,282
Zuko, see you later, okay.

861
00:54:05,034 --> 00:54:07,368
-Bye, Frenchy.
-See you, Sandy.

862
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:13,041
Great. I get stuck
with the cheque again. Give me money.

863
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:16,628
Okay, what is it, huh?
What's with you tonight?

864
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:18,296
You've got the personality of a wet mop.

865
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:19,547
Don't start with me.

866
00:54:19,632 --> 00:54:22,967
Oh, sure, fine. Okay, eureka.
How about I finish with you, huh?

867
00:54:23,052 --> 00:54:24,510
Finish this!

868
00:54:26,138 --> 00:54:28,097
To you from me, Pinky Lee.

869
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:31,935
Sorry, French.

870
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:34,354
Rizzo!

871
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:40,401
Hey, Rizzo! I wanna talk to you! Now!

872
00:54:42,488 --> 00:54:44,781
No use crying over spilled milkshake.

873
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:46,824
Oh, I'll be okay.

874
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:50,328
You know it's near closing time,
don't you?

875
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:52,830
Do you mind if I stay around
a little longer, Vi?

876
00:54:52,915 --> 00:54:54,666
No, suit yourself.

877
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:57,251
-Wow.
-What?

878
00:54:57,461 --> 00:55:01,631
Well, I hate to tell you this
but your hair looks like an Easter egg.

879
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:03,591
Oh, yeah.

880
00:55:03,676 --> 00:55:06,803
Well, I had a little trouble
in tinting class.

881
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:10,723
In fact, I had a little trouble
in all my classes.

882
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:13,643
Beauty school sure wasn't
what I thought it was gonna be.

883
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:15,853
Oh, nothing ever is.

884
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,483
Vi?

885
00:55:21,902 --> 00:55:23,444
I dropped out.

886
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:26,030
What do you think of waitressing?

887
00:55:26,115 --> 00:55:28,199
You're too young to know.

888
00:55:28,909 --> 00:55:31,869
Hey, maybe I could be
a telephone operator.

889
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:37,000
Nah, I don't think I would like to wear
those little things over my ears.

890
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:42,088
God, if only I could have
a guardian angel to tell me what to do.

891
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:45,341
You know, like Debbie Reynolds
had in Tammy.

892
00:55:45,426 --> 00:55:47,093
What do you think?

893
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:50,263
If you find him,
give him my phone number.

894
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:08,781
Your story's sad to tell

895
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:13,453
A teenage ne'er-do-well

896
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:19,584
Most mixed-up non-delinquent
on the block

897
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:26,049
Your future's so unclear now

898
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,386
What's left of your career now?

899
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:34,140
Can't even get a trade in

900
00:56:35,059 --> 00:56:38,436
on your smock

901
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:56,412
Beauty School Dropout

902
00:56:57,331 --> 00:57:00,666
No Graduation Day for you

903
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:02,835
Beauty School Dropout

904
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:07,340
Missed your midterms
and flunked shampoo

905
00:57:07,466 --> 00:57:10,676
Well, at least you could have taken time

906
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:13,679
to wash and clean your clothes up

907
00:57:13,806 --> 00:57:16,265
After spending all that dough

908
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:19,769
to have the doctor fix your nose up

909
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:21,854
Baby, get movin'

910
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:26,192
Why keep your feeble hopes alive?

911
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:29,362
What are you provin'?

912
00:57:29,488 --> 00:57:32,865
You've got the dream but not the drive

913
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:36,035
If you go for your diploma

914
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,955
you could join a steno pool

915
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:41,124
Turn in your teasing comb

916
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:44,210
and go back to high school

917
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,967
Beauty School Dropout

918
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:54,554
Hangin' around the corner store

919
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:57,140
Beauty School Dropout

920
00:57:58,058 --> 00:58:01,561
It's about time you knew the score

921
00:58:01,687 --> 00:58:04,814
Well, they couldn't teach you anything

922
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:07,817
You think you're such a looker

923
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:11,404
But no customer would go to you

924
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:14,532
unless she was a hooker

925
00:58:18,871 --> 00:58:20,580
Baby, don't sweat it

926
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:22,081
Don't sweat it

927
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:25,334
You're not cut out to hold a job

928
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:27,420
Better forget it

929
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:28,754
Forget it

930
00:58:28,881 --> 00:58:32,091
Who wants their hair done by a slob?

931
00:58:32,176 --> 00:58:35,761
Now your bangs are curled
your lashes twirled

932
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:38,347
But still the world is cruel

933
00:58:38,432 --> 00:58:40,683
Wipe off that angel face

934
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:43,561
and go back to high school

935
00:58:44,897 --> 00:58:46,606
Baby, don't blow it

936
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:51,277
Don't put my good advice to shame

937
00:58:51,403 --> 00:58:53,279
Baby, you know it

938
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:57,867
Even Dear Abby'd say the same

939
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:59,785
Now, I've called the shot

940
00:58:59,912 --> 00:59:01,454
Get off the pot

941
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:06,125
I really gotta fly

942
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:09,879
Gotta be goin'

943
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:13,633
to that malt shop

944
00:59:13,717 --> 00:59:18,804
in the sky

945
00:59:23,936 --> 00:59:26,896
-Beauty School Dropout
-Beauty School Dropout

946
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:29,607
Go back to high school

947
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:33,319
-Beauty School Dropout
-Beauty School Dropout

948
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:36,072
Go back to high school

00:59:36,657 --> 00:59:39,742
-Beauty School Dropout
-Beauty School Dropout

950
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:43,913
Go back to high school

951
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:58,511
-Just lower your head, Kenickie.
-What are you doing?

952
00:59:58,637 --> 01:00:00,429
Come on, Kenickie.
Give him a break, huh?

953
01:00:00,514 --> 01:00:04,183
-Oh, I'll give you a break all right.
-No, we'll work on the brakes later.

954
01:00:04,268 --> 01:00:05,768
Move over, slick.

955
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:08,020
-Hey, fruitcake, you got it on backwards.
-All right.

956
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:09,981
What kind of car
did you swipe this from anyway?

957
01:00:10,065 --> 01:00:11,107
-Your mother's.
-Your mother's.

958
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,943
Hey, Charlie, don't forget
the other cable, huh?

959
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:16,779
There's a ramp set up
at the service door for that camera.

960
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:20,783
Rizz.

961
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:30,001
Can you believe it?
We'll be on nationwide television.

962
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:36,966
-How you doing?
-You still gonna go to the dance?

963
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:40,720
Man, I'm gonna have
the hottest date there.

964
01:00:41,805 --> 01:00:45,224
Biggest thing that ever happened
to Rydell High and we don't have dates.

965
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:47,310
What about Rudie
from the Capri Lounge?

966
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:49,562
-Get serious.
-It's a suggestion.

967
01:00:49,688 --> 01:00:51,230
Well, I already called him.

968
01:00:57,821 --> 01:01:00,406
Relax, I think our luck is changing.

969
01:01:07,748 --> 01:01:09,415
Do you know what you're doing?

970
01:01:09,541 --> 01:01:11,667
What we're doing. Come on.

971
01:01:41,448 --> 01:01:43,908
Hey, Marty, you're looking good.

972
01:01:44,618 --> 01:01:47,286
Would you just excuse me one second?

973
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:52,541
You're feeling good, too, huh?

974
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:55,378
Sonny, there he is.
Look, that's Vince Fontaine.

975
01:01:55,462 --> 01:01:57,546
Yeah, I've seen better heads
on a mug of beer.

976
01:01:57,631 --> 01:02:00,383
Would you grow up? He's the living end.

977
01:02:00,467 --> 01:02:02,760
Yeah, if you like older guys.

978
01:02:15,774 --> 01:02:17,316
Danny, this is so exciting.

979
01:02:17,401 --> 01:02:20,486
Yeah, well, you see what you gotta do
is make friends with the cameraman.

980
01:02:20,612 --> 01:02:23,155
-You know the cameraman?
-Yeah, his name's Ted.

981
01:02:23,824 --> 01:02:25,908
Doody, how do I look?

982
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:28,661
Like a beautiful blonde pineapple.

983
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:31,580
That's good. That's good.

984
01:02:31,665 --> 01:02:34,583
You're late, fellows.
Where you been, huh?

985
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:37,586
-Boy, the gym never looked so good.
-Yeah, did you bring the provisions?

986
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:41,424
All right, kids.
I want a big circle here, a big circle.

987
01:02:42,843 --> 01:02:46,929
Come on, boys and girls,
we are going on the air very shortly.

988
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:49,765
But first,
let's have some warm-up numbers

989
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:52,685
with Johnny Casino and The Gamblers.

990
01:03:57,501 --> 01:04:00,002
-What are their names?
-Fred and Ginger.

991
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:02,713
-Fred and Ginger.
-But... Go tell him the truth.

992
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:27,363
I hope I don't get camera fright.

993
01:04:27,447 --> 01:04:30,115
Oh, don't worry about it.
We're gonna be cool, all right?

994
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,034
-Yeah?
-Don't worry?

995
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:34,036
Good. Come on, let's go.

996
01:04:51,972 --> 01:04:54,139
Why don't you let me lead for a change?

997
01:04:54,266 --> 01:04:56,308
I can't help it. I'm used to leading.

998
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:57,601
Okay.

999
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:03,732
Doody, can't you turn me around
or something?

1000
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:06,151
Don't talk, French. I'm trying to count.

1001
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:11,156
A melody that's never the same

1002
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:13,909
A melody that's calling your name

1003
01:05:13,994 --> 01:05:16,495
Did you ever think about
taking up singing professionally?

1004
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:20,332
Come back to me, please

1005
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:24,670
Hey, Zuko! Zuk! Zuk!
I want you to meet Cha Cha DiGregorio.

1006
01:05:24,796 --> 01:05:27,339
-How you doing, Zuko baby?
-All right.

1007
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:30,009
-Who is she?
-They call me Cha Cha,

1008
01:05:30,093 --> 01:05:32,678
'cause I'm the best dancer
at Saint Bernadette's.

1009
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,972
With the worst reputation.

1010
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:37,433
Let's go, Sandy.

1011
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:42,187
-Who's that girl?
-She's just a girl I know, that's all.

1012
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:49,445
Hi.

1013
01:05:51,323 --> 01:05:53,115
I'm Vince Fontaine.

1014
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:56,952
Hey, do your folks know
I come into your room every night?

1015
01:05:57,037 --> 01:05:59,163
Over KZAZ, that is.

1016
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:04,460
I'm judging the dance contest.

1017
01:06:04,544 --> 01:06:06,545
I don't think I'm entered.

1018
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:08,464
A knockout like you?

1019
01:06:08,548 --> 01:06:10,633
-What's your name?
-Marty.

1020
01:06:10,717 --> 01:06:14,011
-Marty what?
-Maraschino.

1021
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:16,388
You know, like in cherry.

1022
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:41,288
-What are you doing?
-Washing my hands.

1023
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:04,436
How do you know her?

1024
01:07:04,938 --> 01:07:07,773
She's just an old friend of the family,
that's all.

1025
01:07:14,948 --> 01:07:17,533
-Aren't you glad to be back?
-Oh, yeah.

1026
01:07:17,617 --> 01:07:20,202
Besides, blondes do have more fun.

1027
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:31,463
When I hear music,
I just can't make my feet behave.

1028
01:07:31,548 --> 01:07:34,091
-Thinks she's Tinker Bell.
-Hush, Sonny.

1029
01:07:47,147 --> 01:07:49,231
The Rydell fight song!

1030
01:08:13,173 --> 01:08:16,425
-When you are finished.
-We're finished.

1031
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:20,846
You will be happy to know that
I am not judging the dance contest.

1032
01:08:26,311 --> 01:08:29,188
I think we all owe a round of applause

1033
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:32,608
to Patty Simcox and Eugene Felsnick

1034
01:08:32,692 --> 01:08:35,277
and committee
for their beautiful decorations.

1035
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:37,529
Let's hear it for the toilet paper!

1036
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:46,371
In a few moments, the entire nation
will be watching Rydell High.

1037
01:08:46,498 --> 01:08:47,873
God help us!

1038
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:50,793
And I want you all
to be on your best behaviour.

1039
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:52,628
No heinie biting!

1040
01:08:54,714 --> 01:08:58,467
And now, here he is,
the Prince of the Platters,

1041
01:08:58,551 --> 01:09:00,636
Mr Vince Fontaine.

1042
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:10,062
Mr Vince Fontaine!

1043
01:09:34,337 --> 01:09:37,422
Hey, it's great being here
at Rydell High.

1044
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:41,677
What's your name, sweetheart?

1045
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:45,264
Hiya, honey.

1046
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:47,432
And now for the rules.

1047
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:52,187
Game rule one.

1048
01:09:52,772 --> 01:09:54,439
All couples must be boy-girl.

1049
01:09:54,566 --> 01:09:56,358
Yeah, too bad, Eugene.

1050
01:09:58,903 --> 01:10:01,280
All right, all right, all right. Come on.

1051
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:03,282
Game rule two.

1052
01:10:03,408 --> 01:10:05,784
During the dance contest,
if you're tapped on the shoulder,

1053
01:10:05,869 --> 01:10:08,704
you must leave
the floor immediately or else.

1054
01:10:08,788 --> 01:10:10,038
l mean it.

1055
01:10:10,123 --> 01:10:11,707
And rule three,

1056
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:16,712
anyone doing tasteless or vulgar
movements will be disqualified.

1057
01:10:16,796 --> 01:10:18,547
That leaves us out.

1058
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:24,636
Can we keep it clean, please?
Let's keep it clean.

1059
01:10:24,721 --> 01:10:27,139
-Twenty seconds.
-Oh, 20 seconds.

1060
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:28,891
Thank you, fans and friends
and odds and ends.

1061
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:31,143
And now for you gals and guys,
a few words to the wise.

1062
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:32,644
You Jims and Sals are my best pals,

1063
01:10:32,729 --> 01:10:34,062
and to look your best
for the big contest,

1064
01:10:34,147 --> 01:10:35,480
just be yourselves and have a ball.

1065
01:10:35,607 --> 01:10:36,899
That's what it's all about after all!

1066
01:10:36,983 --> 01:10:38,650
So forget about the camera
and think about the beat,

1067
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:40,152
we'll give the folks at home
a real big treat.

1068
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:41,403
Don't worry about where the camera is,

1069
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:42,821
just keep on dancing, that's your biz.

1070
01:10:42,906 --> 01:10:44,406
Hey, and if I tap your shoulder,
move to the side,

1071
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:45,908
let the others finish the ride.

1072
01:10:45,992 --> 01:10:47,326
Ten seconds.

1073
01:10:47,452 --> 01:10:48,994
Nine, eight,

1074
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:52,414
seven, six, five, four,

1075
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:54,583
three, two, one.

1076
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:56,168
On the air.

1077
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:58,170
Hello, welcome to National Bandstand,

1078
01:10:58,296 --> 01:11:00,255
coming to you live
from Rydell High School.

1079
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:03,175
This is the event you've all been
waiting for, the National Dance-Off.

1080
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:06,678
And away we go with
Johnny Casino and The Gamblers.

1081
01:11:22,028 --> 01:11:24,029
Look, there's the camera!

1082
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:35,207
-Look, it's Putzie and Jan.
-Yeah.

1083
01:12:00,692 --> 01:12:02,734
Oh, there's Danny and Sandy.

1084
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:25,340
Now to the event you've all been
waiting for, the National Dance-Off.

1085
01:12:25,425 --> 01:12:27,592
Some lucky guy and gal
is gonna go bopping home

1086
01:12:27,677 --> 01:12:29,011
with some fantabulous prizes.

1087
01:12:29,095 --> 01:12:30,512
But don't feel bad if I bump youse out

1088
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:32,180
'cause it doesn't matter
if you win or lose,

1089
01:12:32,265 --> 01:12:34,766
it's what you do
with your dancing shoes.

1090
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:37,102
Hey, does everybody here know Marty?

1091
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:43,066
Okay, cats, throw your mittens
around your kittens and away we go!

1092
01:12:47,405 --> 01:12:49,698
That wasn't supposed to happen!

1093
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:52,367
Let's go! Let's hand jive!

1094
01:12:53,953 --> 01:12:56,455
Before I was born late one night

1095
01:12:57,707 --> 01:13:00,375
My papa said everything's all right

1096
01:13:01,711 --> 01:13:03,211
The doctor made my ma lay down

1097
01:13:03,296 --> 01:13:04,713
That guy over there
with the chick in the red,

1098
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:05,881
throw them out.

1099
01:13:05,965 --> 01:13:08,133
With her stomach bouncing all around

1100
01:13:08,468 --> 01:13:10,719
'Cause a bebop stork
Was about to arrive

1101
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:12,804
My mom gave birth to the hand jive

1102
01:13:14,474 --> 01:13:17,392
I could barely walk
When l milked a cow

1103
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:20,645
When I was three, I pushed a plough

1104
01:13:21,981 --> 01:13:24,775
While chopping wood, I'd move my legs

1105
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:28,779
And started dancing
While I gathered eggs

1106
01:13:29,822 --> 01:13:31,490
The townfolk clapped
When I was only five

1107
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:34,326
l'd outdance them all
He's born to hand jive

1108
01:13:35,286 --> 01:13:37,454
Yes, move it, buddy.

1109
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:40,916
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1110
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,001
Shake it, shake it, shake it.

1111
01:13:43,086 --> 01:13:45,003
Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy.

1112
01:13:45,838 --> 01:13:47,339
Attagirl!

1113
01:13:48,091 --> 01:13:51,093
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

1114
01:13:51,177 --> 01:13:52,177
Everybody!

1115
01:13:52,345 --> 01:13:59,142
Born to hand jive, baby

1116
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:01,019
Yeah.

1117
01:14:01,104 --> 01:14:03,438
Here we go. Come on.

1118
01:14:03,523 --> 01:14:06,024
Hey, break it up, break it up!
What is that?

1119
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:08,193
Break it up!

1120
01:14:11,197 --> 01:14:13,156
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1121
01:14:14,117 --> 01:14:16,118
Come on now, shake it!

1122
01:14:16,202 --> 01:14:17,661
Yeah!

1123
01:14:18,663 --> 01:14:20,122
Twist it!

1124
01:14:30,216 --> 01:14:31,842
All right, get it!

1125
01:15:03,374 --> 01:15:09,921
How low can you go?

1126
01:15:10,047 --> 01:15:12,215
No, no, don't. Bad boy! Not here!

1127
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:40,410
There you go!

1128
01:15:42,288 --> 01:15:44,289
Come on now, hand jive!

1129
01:16:06,812 --> 01:16:08,813
That's the stuff!

1130
01:16:12,235 --> 01:16:13,777
Do it, baby!

1131
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:17,280
Do it!

1132
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:30,669
That's the hand jive grand jive!

1133
01:16:50,523 --> 01:16:52,899
Yeah, now let's bring it up!

1134
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:54,818
Bring it on up!

1135
01:16:57,363 --> 01:17:00,240
Higher!

1136
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:04,244
Higher and higher!

1137
01:17:04,829 --> 01:17:07,872
Now can you hand jive, baby?

1138
01:17:08,374 --> 01:17:11,376
Oh, can you hand jive, baby?

1139
01:17:11,752 --> 01:17:16,756
Oh, yeah

1140
01:17:17,717 --> 01:17:19,843
Born to hand jive!
Oh, yeah!

1141
01:17:19,927 --> 01:17:21,678
Oh, yeah!

1142
01:17:21,762 --> 01:17:24,097
Now let's meet them.
Here they are, the new champs.

1143
01:17:24,223 --> 01:17:26,391
Come on. Come on over here.

1144
01:17:28,394 --> 01:17:32,605
-Can l have your names, please?
-Cha Cha DiGregorio and Danny Zuko.

1145
01:17:33,316 --> 01:17:34,441
Cha Cha and Danny, congratulations.

1146
01:17:34,567 --> 01:17:35,942
Come on, we're gonna do it now.

1147
01:17:36,068 --> 01:17:38,153
-Where's Marty?
-Don't worry, she's in good hands.

1148
01:17:38,237 --> 01:17:40,280
-Whose?
-I don't know.

1149
01:17:42,241 --> 01:17:45,410
Now let's see our champs
in a spotlight dance.

1150
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:49,247
Blue moon

1151
01:17:51,751 --> 01:17:55,211
You saw me standing alone

1152
01:17:57,965 --> 01:18:02,302
Without a dream in my heart

1153
01:18:04,305 --> 01:18:08,475
Without a love of my own

1154
01:18:09,977 --> 01:18:12,729
Ready? One, one, two, three, go.

1155
01:18:12,813 --> 01:18:14,814
Blue moon

1156
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:21,446
I wonder who that is on the right?

1157
01:18:21,947 --> 01:18:25,492
We have pictures
of you so-called mooners.

1158
01:18:25,618 --> 01:18:28,203
And just because the pictures
aren't of your faces

1159
01:18:28,287 --> 01:18:30,246
doesn't mean we can't identify you.

1160
01:18:30,331 --> 01:18:34,334
At this very moment, those pictures
are on the way to Washington

1161
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:39,631
where the FBI has experts
in this type of identification.

1162
01:18:39,757 --> 01:18:44,761
If you turn yourselves in now,
you may escape a federal charge.

1163
01:19:07,159 --> 01:19:09,953
Come on, Doody, watch your hands.
Putzie, move it out.

1164
01:19:10,037 --> 01:19:12,455
I feel like a meatball in here.

1165
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:15,208
-Okay, let's go find the chicks.
-Yeah.

1166
01:19:15,501 --> 01:19:17,293
Marty. Marty.

1167
01:19:22,341 --> 01:19:24,843
Hold my money. Don't let me
go near the refreshment stand.

1168
01:19:24,969 --> 01:19:27,011
-All right.
-I'm not hungry.

1169
01:19:27,138 --> 01:19:29,180
-I'm not hungry.
-Hey, what's happening?

1170
01:19:29,974 --> 01:19:32,016
There's nobody here.

1171
01:19:36,355 --> 01:19:39,566
Oh, come on, Sandy.
I told you on the phone that I was sorry.

1172
01:19:39,692 --> 01:19:42,819
-I know that you did.
-Well, you do believe me, don't you?

1173
01:19:42,903 --> 01:19:46,322
Well, yes, but I still think
that you and Cha Cha went together.

1174
01:19:47,074 --> 01:19:50,201
We did not go together, Sandy.
We just went together, that's all.

1175
01:19:50,327 --> 01:19:53,872
-It's the same thing.
-No. No. No.

1176
01:20:16,061 --> 01:20:18,938
Oh! Oh, Sandy, I'm sorry. I...

1177
01:20:28,407 --> 01:20:29,574
Sandy,

1178
01:20:31,452 --> 01:20:33,453
would you wear my ring?

1179
01:20:33,913 --> 01:20:36,664
Oh, Danny. I don't know what to say.

1180
01:20:36,749 --> 01:20:38,750
-Say "yes."
-Yes.

1181
01:20:43,297 --> 01:20:46,007
Oh, Danny, this means so much to me,

1182
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:48,468
'cause I know now that you respect me.

1183
01:20:56,435 --> 01:20:57,769
Hey, Rizz?

1184
01:20:57,895 --> 01:20:59,229
Watch it.

1185
01:21:00,439 --> 01:21:03,691
-What is with you tonight?
-I feel like a defective typewriter.

1186
01:21:03,776 --> 01:21:05,818
-Huh?
-I skipped a period.

1187
01:21:05,945 --> 01:21:08,363
-You think you're PG?
-I don't know. Big deal.

1188
01:21:08,447 --> 01:21:11,324
-Well, was it Kenickie?
-Nah, you don't know the guy.

1189
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:13,993
Well, hey, Rizz, look...
Look, Rizz, it's okay.

1190
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:17,580
I caught Vince Fontaine trying to put
aspirin in my Coke at the dance.

1191
01:21:17,665 --> 01:21:20,959
Hey. Marty, you ain't gonna tell
nobody about this, right?

1192
01:21:21,085 --> 01:21:23,795
Oh, sure, Rizz.
Look, I'll take it to the grave, okay?

1193
01:21:27,466 --> 01:21:31,010
Coming through, coming through.
Come on, lady with a baby.

1194
01:21:34,515 --> 01:21:36,558
Hey, Marty, what's up?

1195
01:21:36,642 --> 01:21:39,018
Rizzo's pregnant. Don't tell anybody.

1196
01:21:43,691 --> 01:21:46,150
Hey, Rizzo's got a bun in the oven.

1197
01:21:57,621 --> 01:21:59,455
Rizzo's knocked up.

1198
01:22:03,377 --> 01:22:05,712
Rizzo, I hear you're knocked up.

1199
01:22:05,838 --> 01:22:06,963
-You do, huh?
-Yeah.

1200
01:22:07,047 --> 01:22:09,173
Boy, good news really travels fast.

1201
01:22:09,883 --> 01:22:12,010
Why didn't you tell me about it?

1202
01:22:12,511 --> 01:22:13,928
What's it to you?

1203
01:22:14,013 --> 01:22:16,264
I thought I might be able
to do something.

1204
01:22:16,348 --> 01:22:18,016
You did enough.

1205
01:22:19,393 --> 01:22:21,978
I don't run away from my mistakes.

1206
01:22:22,313 --> 01:22:26,190
Hey, don't worry about it, Kenickie.
It was somebody else's mistake.

1207
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:33,990
Thanks a lot, kid.

1208
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:36,576
Anytime.

1209
01:22:43,667 --> 01:22:46,836
-Oh, I hope you're not getting a cold.
-Oh, no. No.

1210
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:49,922
It's just probably
a little drive-in dust, that's all.

1211
01:23:02,227 --> 01:23:04,395
-Danny!
-Sandy! Oh, Sandy.

1212
01:23:04,521 --> 01:23:06,898
-Danny, what are you doing?
-Oh, Sandy.

1213
01:23:07,024 --> 01:23:08,691
Don't worry about it, nobody's watching.

1214
01:23:08,776 --> 01:23:10,526
Danny, get off me!

1215
01:23:10,944 --> 01:23:14,906
Sandy, what's the matter with you?
I thought I meant something to you.

1216
01:23:15,032 --> 01:23:16,407
Meant something to you?

1217
01:23:16,533 --> 01:23:19,452
You think I'm gonna stay here
with you in this sin wagon?

1218
01:23:19,578 --> 01:23:21,871
You can take this piece of tin!

1219
01:23:22,539 --> 01:23:25,541
Sandy, you just can't
walk out of a drive-in!

1220
01:23:35,094 --> 01:23:37,595
Stranded at the drive-in

1221
01:23:38,931 --> 01:23:42,266
Branded a fool

1222
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:45,937
What will they say

1223
01:23:46,772 --> 01:23:49,899
Monday at school?

1224
01:23:57,408 --> 01:24:01,619
Sandy, can't you see

1225
01:24:01,745 --> 01:24:04,622
I'm in misery?

1226
01:24:05,916 --> 01:24:07,834
We made a start

1227
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:10,169
Now we're apart

1228
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:13,506
There's nothin' left for me

1229
01:24:14,758 --> 01:24:16,968
Love has flown

1230
01:24:17,094 --> 01:24:22,265
All alone I sit and wonder why-yi-yi-yi

1231
01:24:23,684 --> 01:24:27,103
Why you left me

1232
01:24:27,646 --> 01:24:33,276
Oh, Sandy

1233
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:37,363
Baby, someday

1234
01:24:37,489 --> 01:24:40,825
when high school is done

1235
01:24:42,286 --> 01:24:46,205
Somehow, some way

1236
01:24:46,331 --> 01:24:49,500
our two worlds will be one

1237
01:24:50,836 --> 01:24:54,964
ln heaven forever

1238
01:24:55,048 --> 01:24:58,509
and ever we will be

1239
01:24:59,386 --> 01:25:02,722
Oh, please, say you'll stay

1240
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:06,058
Oh, Sandy

1241
01:25:09,563 --> 01:25:11,856
Sandy, my darling

1242
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:14,567
you hurt me real bad

1243
01:25:15,402 --> 01:25:17,195
You know it's true

1244
01:25:18,363 --> 01:25:21,365
But, baby, you gotta believe me
when I say

1245
01:25:23,035 --> 01:25:25,077
I'm helpless without you

1246
01:25:26,079 --> 01:25:28,247
Love has flown

1247
01:25:28,373 --> 01:25:33,503
All alone I sit, I wonder why-yi-yi-yi

1248
01:25:34,671 --> 01:25:38,216
Oh, why you left me

1249
01:25:39,009 --> 01:25:41,427
Oh, Sandy

1250
01:25:43,847 --> 01:25:50,394
Sandy

1251
01:25:54,566 --> 01:25:58,736
Why-yi-yi-yi?

1252
01:25:59,905 --> 01:26:01,739
Oh, Sandy!

1253
01:26:06,453 --> 01:26:08,246
Head it out. Come on, guys.

1254
01:26:08,372 --> 01:26:10,748
All right, pull out!
Pull out! Pull out!

1255
01:26:15,629 --> 01:26:18,214
Well, the crate shaped up.

1256
01:26:18,298 --> 01:26:20,258
And it's as hot as the parts on it.

1257
01:26:20,384 --> 01:26:22,552
Hey, we didn't steal all of it.
Some of it was donated.

1258
01:26:22,636 --> 01:26:25,263
Yeah, this baby's gonna knock them
on their ears at Thunder Road.

1259
01:26:25,389 --> 01:26:27,723
You're right.
You could still change your mind.

1260
01:26:27,808 --> 01:26:31,143
-The flag goes down in three hours.
-And Greased Lightning strikes.

1261
01:26:31,270 --> 01:26:32,728
Hey, Mrs Murdock, you coming?

1262
01:26:32,813 --> 01:26:36,023
I don't expect my boys to let me down,
and I won't let them down.

1263
01:26:36,108 --> 01:26:38,442
-That's the way!
-Way to go, Murdock!

1264
01:26:39,111 --> 01:26:41,112
I wanna talk to you.

1265
01:26:43,448 --> 01:26:46,284
Hey, look, those guys at Thunder Road,
they don't fool around.

1266
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:47,994
You know that, right?

1267
01:26:48,662 --> 01:26:50,663
You want me to punk out?

1268
01:26:50,789 --> 01:26:53,666
No, I'm not saying punking out,
but I'm just...

1269
01:26:54,793 --> 01:26:56,794
You know what I mean. I...

1270
01:26:58,088 --> 01:27:02,592
Hey, Danny, we've been friends
a long time, right?

1271
01:27:03,176 --> 01:27:04,343
Yeah.

1272
01:27:05,929 --> 01:27:08,431
Well, you remember the drive-in
the other night, we went

1273
01:27:08,515 --> 01:27:11,893
and the movie, and it was like the duel
and the guy's best friend went with him

1274
01:27:11,977 --> 01:27:15,021
and was like his lieutenant,
like his second, you know?

1275
01:27:15,147 --> 01:27:16,772
Yeah. So?

1276
01:27:18,859 --> 01:27:23,446
Well, I thought that you could maybe
be my second at Thunder Road.

1277
01:27:23,864 --> 01:27:26,365
What do you mean? You want me
to drive with you or what?

1278
01:27:26,491 --> 01:27:27,533
No, I...

1279
01:27:29,953 --> 01:27:32,121
Oh. Hey, hey.

1280
01:27:38,045 --> 01:27:40,338
Well, listen, I'll pick you up
at 3:00, huh?

1281
01:27:40,464 --> 01:27:42,089
-Yeah, see you later.
-Yeah.

1282
01:27:42,174 --> 01:27:45,343
Hey, open up the door.
What are you guys standing around for?

1283
01:27:45,469 --> 01:27:48,512
Get that can off the front of the car,
you putz.

1284
01:27:55,145 --> 01:27:56,729
Oh, hello, Rizz.

1285
01:27:56,855 --> 01:27:59,523
-Are you going to Thunder Road?
-Not a chance.

1286
01:27:59,650 --> 01:28:01,776
I've got to go. I have to talk to Danny.

1287
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:05,029
Unless you got wheels and a motor,
he won't know you're alive.

1288
01:28:05,155 --> 01:28:07,782
Listen, Rizz, I know that we
haven't been the best of friends,

1289
01:28:07,866 --> 01:28:09,492
but if there's anything I can do...

1290
01:28:09,576 --> 01:28:13,371
Oh, I can take care of myself
and anybody else who comes along.

1291
01:28:13,997 --> 01:28:17,166
You think I don't know
what people are saying about me?

1292
01:28:17,584 --> 01:28:18,751
Hey.

1293
01:28:22,881 --> 01:28:24,173
Thanks.

1294
01:28:34,559 --> 01:28:37,228
That's the one I was telling you about.

1295
01:28:39,231 --> 01:28:42,900
There are worse things I could do

1296
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:47,196
than go with a boy or two

1297
01:28:48,407 --> 01:28:50,491
Even though the neighbourhood

1298
01:28:50,575 --> 01:28:54,245
thinks I'm trashy and no good

1299
01:28:54,371 --> 01:28:58,165
I suppose it could be true

1300
01:28:58,250 --> 01:29:02,294
But there are worse things I could do

1301
01:29:02,421 --> 01:29:07,550
I could flirt with all the guys

1302
01:29:10,262 --> 01:29:15,307
Smile at them and bat my eyes

1303
01:29:17,269 --> 01:29:20,938
Press against them when we dance

1304
01:29:21,064 --> 01:29:24,483
Make them think they stand a chance

1305
01:29:24,609 --> 01:29:28,487
Then refuse to see it through

1306
01:29:29,322 --> 01:29:31,741
That's a thing I'd never do

1307
01:29:32,284 --> 01:29:37,455
I could stay home every night

1308
01:29:39,124 --> 01:29:43,794
Wait around for Mr Right

1309
01:29:46,173 --> 01:29:49,633
Take cold showers every day

1310
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:53,095
And throw my life away

1311
01:29:53,180 --> 01:29:56,307
on a dream that won't come true

1312
01:29:58,518 --> 01:30:03,522
l could hurt someone like me

1313
01:30:06,276 --> 01:30:11,155
Out of spite orjealousy

1314
01:30:13,283 --> 01:30:16,494
l don't steal and l don't lie

1315
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:19,955
But I can feel and I can cry

1316
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:25,169
A fact I'll bet you never knew

1317
01:30:27,798 --> 01:30:32,343
But to cry in front of you

1318
01:30:34,679 --> 01:30:37,348
That's the worst thing

1319
01:30:37,474 --> 01:30:42,061
l could do

1320
01:31:26,898 --> 01:31:28,899
So, you guys think
you got a winner there, huh?

1321
01:31:29,025 --> 01:31:30,192
That's right.

1322
01:31:30,277 --> 01:31:33,320
Yeah, well, it takes more than a coat
of paint to make it at Thunder Road.

1323
01:31:33,405 --> 01:31:34,905
-Oh, yeah?
-You guys ain't thinking

1324
01:31:35,031 --> 01:31:36,574
about changing your mind, are you?

1325
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:39,660
-No way.
-Good, 'cause we're racing for pinks.

1326
01:31:39,744 --> 01:31:40,995
Pinks?

1327
01:31:41,079 --> 01:31:44,248
Pinks, you punk.
Pink slips. Ownership papers.

1328
01:31:46,418 --> 01:31:47,918
Come on, Zuk.

1329
01:31:48,211 --> 01:31:51,297
Come on. Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it, all right?

1330
01:31:51,423 --> 01:31:53,424
Hey, get the dude, man.

1331
01:31:59,931 --> 01:32:04,435
-What did she give him?
-A lock of hair from her chest.

1332
01:32:07,647 --> 01:32:09,273
Poor Kenickie.

1333
01:32:11,484 --> 01:32:15,654
See a penny, pick it up,
all day long you'll have good luck.

1334
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:17,281
Give me that.

1335
01:32:20,493 --> 01:32:23,037
If it were in any better condition,
it would fly.

1336
01:32:23,121 --> 01:32:24,288
Yeah, well, she's gonna.

1337
01:32:24,414 --> 01:32:27,166
Here, Kenickie. I brought you
a little something for good luck.

1338
01:32:27,292 --> 01:32:28,959
-Gee, thanks.
-Oops, I'm sorry.

1339
01:32:29,085 --> 01:32:31,503
Hey, don't worry about it.
Don't worry, I'll get it.

1340
01:32:36,468 --> 01:32:37,843
You putz!

1341
01:32:39,346 --> 01:32:41,805
Oh, here, put this under his head.

1342
01:32:43,016 --> 01:32:46,060
-Zuko, he's out cold.
-What are we gonna do?

1343
01:32:46,144 --> 01:32:48,687
Kenickie. Hey, talk to me, buddy, huh?

1344
01:32:48,813 --> 01:32:50,773
-What?
-You okay?

1345
01:32:52,150 --> 01:32:54,360
Yeah. I'm okay.

1346
01:32:54,486 --> 01:32:55,611
I'm fine.

1347
01:32:55,695 --> 01:32:57,613
-Oh, God.
-Oh, you can't drive.

1348
01:32:57,697 --> 01:33:02,326
Hey, no, really, I'm all right.
I'm just seeing two of you, man.

1349
01:33:03,662 --> 01:33:06,455
Hey, you want me to drive for you, huh?

1350
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:10,542
Yeah.

1351
01:33:10,669 --> 01:33:12,962
All right. Come on, let's help him up.

1352
01:33:13,046 --> 01:33:15,214
Hey, Marty, give me a hand.

1353
01:33:30,563 --> 01:33:31,730
Hey.

1354
01:33:32,399 --> 01:33:34,358
The rules are, there ain't no rules.

1355
01:33:34,484 --> 01:33:35,901
It's to the second bridge and back

1356
01:33:36,027 --> 01:33:38,529
and the one
who makes it here first, wins.

1357
01:33:39,322 --> 01:33:41,031
Haul ass, kid.

1358
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:03,345
You ain't gonna see me for dust, Zuko.

1359
01:34:30,457 --> 01:34:31,915
Zuk! Go! Go! Go!

1360
01:34:35,962 --> 01:34:37,212
Come on, baby.

1361
01:36:14,352 --> 01:36:17,146
-All right!
-Congratulations!

1362
01:36:24,904 --> 01:36:31,452
For he's a jolly good fellow

1363
01:36:31,536 --> 01:36:34,037
Which nobody can deny

1364
01:36:35,498 --> 01:36:38,250
Look at me

1365
01:36:38,376 --> 01:36:41,378
There has to be

1366
01:36:42,046 --> 01:36:46,550
something more
than what they see

1367
01:36:47,385 --> 01:36:49,887
Wholesome and pure

1368
01:36:50,013 --> 01:36:53,640
Oh, so scared and unsure

1369
01:36:53,725 --> 01:36:58,270
A poor man's Sandra Dee

1370
01:36:58,688 --> 01:37:00,439
Danny won.

1371
01:37:00,565 --> 01:37:02,399
-Isn't that great?
-Yeah.

1372
01:37:04,694 --> 01:37:07,571
What's the matter? Aren't you happy?

1373
01:37:07,697 --> 01:37:10,449
No, not really, Frenchy,
but I think I know a way I could be.

1374
01:37:10,575 --> 01:37:12,951
-Could you help me?
-Of course.

1375
01:37:13,077 --> 01:37:15,787
-Can I come over to your place?
-Sure. Come on.

1376
01:37:20,752 --> 01:37:25,881
Sandy, you must start anew

1377
01:37:26,257 --> 01:37:30,385
Don't you know what you must do?

1378
01:37:30,470 --> 01:37:33,180
Hold your head high

1379
01:37:33,264 --> 01:37:36,225
Take a deep breath and sigh

1380
01:37:36,309 --> 01:37:38,018
Come on, Sandy.

1381
01:37:38,102 --> 01:37:39,811
Goodbye

1382
01:37:39,938 --> 01:37:44,942
to Sandra Dee

1383
01:38:01,751 --> 01:38:03,627
Attention, seniors.

1384
01:38:03,753 --> 01:38:06,755
Before the merriment
of commencement commences,

1385
01:38:06,839 --> 01:38:10,217
I hope that your years with us
here at Rydell High

1386
01:38:10,301 --> 01:38:13,011
have prepared you
for the challenges you face.

1387
01:38:13,137 --> 01:38:17,808
Who knows, among you, there may be
a future Eleanor Roosevelt,

1388
01:38:17,976 --> 01:38:20,310
or a Rosemary Clooney.

1389
01:38:20,436 --> 01:38:23,021
And among you young men,
there may be

1390
01:38:23,147 --> 01:38:26,650
a Joe DiMaggio,
a President Eisenhower

1391
01:38:26,776 --> 01:38:29,278
or even a Vice President Nixon.

1392
01:38:30,029 --> 01:38:34,741
But always you will have
the glorious memories of Rydell High.

1393
01:38:34,826 --> 01:38:36,660
Rydell forever.

1394
01:38:36,786 --> 01:38:38,495
Bon voyage.

1395
01:38:44,168 --> 01:38:46,837
Oh, Blanche, stop blubbering.

1396
01:39:27,754 --> 01:39:29,046
How many?

1397
01:39:29,756 --> 01:39:31,006
One.

1398
01:39:35,053 --> 01:39:37,763
I don't believe it. I don't believe it.

1399
01:39:37,889 --> 01:39:41,058
-How can we flunk Phys Ed?
-Did I take Phys Ed?

1400
01:39:42,685 --> 01:39:44,394
Step right up here!

1401
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:48,357
It's for a wonderful cause,
the Teachers' Retirement Fund.

1402
01:39:48,441 --> 01:39:50,817
Give them a pie in the puss.

1403
01:39:50,902 --> 01:39:53,737
Coach Calhoun, how could you
have flunked the T-Birds?

1404
01:39:53,863 --> 01:39:55,906
Don't worry, you'll get your diplomas.

1405
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:57,908
All you have to do
is come back to summer school.

1406
01:39:58,034 --> 01:40:00,077
Summer school? Look out!

1407
01:40:02,622 --> 01:40:05,791
Now see, if you'd have come to class,
you wouldn't have missed me.

1408
01:40:05,917 --> 01:40:08,418
Wise guy, huh? Take that!

1409
01:40:10,129 --> 01:40:12,964
Why, you couldn't even pitch one inning.

1410
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:20,097
-What's your name? I want you.
-It's Eugene.

1411
01:40:20,223 --> 01:40:22,307
-You're a great pitcher.
-Oh, thank you.

1412
01:40:31,943 --> 01:40:33,318
Rizzo!

1413
01:40:33,444 --> 01:40:34,945
Hey, Rizzo!

1414
01:40:35,071 --> 01:40:37,781
Get off of that thing,
you got a condition.

1415
01:40:37,907 --> 01:40:39,991
Forget it. It was a false alarm.

1416
01:40:40,118 --> 01:40:42,077
-What?
-I'm not pregnant.

1417
01:40:47,125 --> 01:40:49,334
Yeah, well,
I'll make an honest woman of you.

1418
01:40:49,836 --> 01:40:52,963
Listen, fella, if this is a line,
I ain't biting.

1419
01:40:53,798 --> 01:40:55,799
That's a bona fide offer.

1420
01:40:55,925 --> 01:40:58,635
Well, it ain't moonlight and roses, but...

1421
01:41:06,352 --> 01:41:08,186
Hey, there's Zuko.

1422
01:41:08,312 --> 01:41:10,313
You gotta be kidding, man!

1423
01:41:12,358 --> 01:41:14,025
Hey, what is this? Halloween?

1424
01:41:14,152 --> 01:41:16,361
Where did you swipe
this letterman sweater, huh?

1425
01:41:16,487 --> 01:41:19,072
While you tools were out stealing
hubcaps, I lettered in track.

1426
01:41:19,157 --> 01:41:20,449
How do you like that?

1427
01:41:20,533 --> 01:41:23,034
I can't believe it.
Danny Zuko turned jock?

1428
01:41:23,161 --> 01:41:26,246
-That's right, I did.
-What you doing? Deserting us?

1429
01:41:26,330 --> 01:41:29,499
Well, you guys can't follow a leader
all your lives, can you?

1430
01:41:30,001 --> 01:41:31,084
Oh, come on, guys.

1431
01:41:31,169 --> 01:41:33,670
You know you mean a lot to me.
It's just that Sandy does, too

1432
01:41:33,796 --> 01:41:36,339
and I'm gonna do anything I can
to get her, that's all.

1433
01:41:48,019 --> 01:41:49,311
Sandy!

1434
01:41:51,147 --> 01:41:53,398
Tell me about it, stud.

1435
01:42:00,990 --> 01:42:03,033
I got chills

1436
01:42:03,159 --> 01:42:05,243
They're multiplyin'

1437
01:42:05,369 --> 01:42:09,748
And l'm losin' control

1438
01:42:10,208 --> 01:42:14,169
'Cause the power you're supplyin'

1439
01:42:14,253 --> 01:42:16,546
It's electrifyin'

1440
01:42:23,387 --> 01:42:25,263
You better shape up

1441
01:42:26,015 --> 01:42:27,891
'Cause l need a man

1442
01:42:29,227 --> 01:42:32,395
And my heart is set on you

1443
01:42:32,730 --> 01:42:34,689
You better shape up

1444
01:42:35,066 --> 01:42:37,359
You better understand

1445
01:42:38,402 --> 01:42:40,570
To my heart I must be true

1446
01:42:40,696 --> 01:42:43,907
Nothin' left, nothin' left for me to do

1447
01:42:44,033 --> 01:42:46,660
-You're the one that l want
-You are the one l want

1448
01:42:46,744 --> 01:42:49,037
You oo oo, honey

1449

1454
01:42:59,590 --> 01:43:01,633
-Oh, yes, indeed
-Yes, indeed

1455
01:43:06,722 --> 01:43:11,017
If you're filled with affection

1456
01:43:11,102 --> 01:43:15,146
You're too shy to convey

1457
01:43:15,273 --> 01:43:19,776
Meditate my direction

1458
01:43:20,778 --> 01:43:23,113
-Feel your way
-Wow!

1459
01:43:24,448 --> 01:43:26,449
I better shape up

1460
01:43:26,951 --> 01:43:29,995
-'Cause you need a man
-l need a man

1461
01:43:30,121 --> 01:43:33,248
Who can keep me satisfied

1462
01:43:33,332 --> 01:43:35,750
I better shape up

1463
01:43:35,835 --> 01:43:39,045
-If I'm gonna prove
-You better prove

1464
01:43:39,130 --> 01:43:41,631
that my faith is justified

1465
01:43:41,757 --> 01:43:45,051
-Are you sure?
-Yes, I'm sure down deep inside

1466
01:43:45,136 --> 01:43:47,888
-You're the one that l want
-You are the one l want

1467
01:43:47,972 --> 01:43:49,848
You oo oo, honey

1468

You're the one that l want

1499
01:44:59,877 --> 01:45:03,380
Hey, everybody.
Rizzo and Kenickie made up.

1500
01:45:03,506 --> 01:45:04,923
All right!

1501
01:45:05,049 --> 01:45:07,759
Oh, look! Oh, the gang's together.

1502
01:45:07,885 --> 01:45:09,886
Well, what are we gonna do
after graduation?

1503
01:45:10,012 --> 01:45:12,597
Yeah, maybe we'll never
see each other again.

1504
01:45:12,723 --> 01:45:14,849
-No, that will never happen.
-How do you know?

1505
01:45:14,934 --> 01:45:16,267
What do you mean how do I know?

1506
01:45:30,074 --> 01:45:34,119
We go together like ra-ma
la-ma la-ma ka ding-a da ding-a dong

1507
01:45:34,245 --> 01:45:36,246

Wha oooh, yeah

1512
01:45:47,091 --> 01:45:48,967
We're one of a kind like

01:45:49,093 --> 01:45:51,678
Dip da-dip da-dip
Doo-wop da doo-bee doo

Wa-wa-wa-waaah

1519
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:06,609
When we go out at night

1520
01:46:06,736 --> 01:46:08,820
And stars are shinin' bright

1521
01:46:08,946 --> 01:46:12,449
Up in the skies above

1522
01:46:12,950 --> 01:46:15,243
Or at the high school dance

1523
01:46:15,327 --> 01:46:17,412
Where you can find romance

1524
01:46:17,496 --> 01:46:21,791
Maybe it might be love

1525
01:46:21,917 --> 01:46:24,044
