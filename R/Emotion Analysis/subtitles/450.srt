1
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:33,131
<i>We've put an explosive charge
in your head.</i>

2
00:00:39,338 --> 00:00:41,033
Does that sound familiar?

3
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:46,472
The Rabbit's Foot. Where is it?

4
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,207
I gave it to you.

5
00:00:49,348 --> 00:00:52,340
Ethan, where's the Rabbit's Foot?

6
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:56,216
Wait... What are you saying?
That wasn't it?

7
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:59,986
- What I gave you, was that...
- I'm going to count to 10.

8
00:01:00,092 --> 00:01:04,153
You're going to tell me
where the Rabbit's Foot is or she dies.

9
00:01:12,204 --> 00:01:14,570
Jules, it's going to be okay.

10
00:01:15,741 --> 00:01:18,335
It's going to be okay.
Do you understand?

11
00:01:19,478 --> 00:01:20,604
One.

12
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,008
You listen to me.
I got exactly what you asked for.

13
00:01:24,116 --> 00:01:26,380
Did you want something else?

14
00:01:26,919 --> 00:01:28,648
If there was a misunderstanding,
I will fix it.

15
00:01:28,754 --> 00:01:30,654
I can get it, whatever you want.

16
00:01:30,756 --> 00:01:31,916
Two.

17
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:35,451
Listen. Talk to me. We can talk,

18
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:37,353
like gentlemen.

19
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,290
- Three.
- God!

20
00:01:50,476 --> 00:01:53,104
All right. All right, all right.

21
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:57,138
I know where the Rabbit's Foot is.

22
00:01:58,351 --> 00:01:59,477
I can help you.

23
00:01:59,585 --> 00:02:02,247
The way you helped me
on the airplane?

24
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:04,017
That way?

25
00:02:04,523 --> 00:02:07,048
You put the gun down.
I'm not talking to you like this.

26
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:09,593
That's your choice. Four.

27
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:12,555
The Rabbit's Foot's in Paris.

28
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:15,395
You want to know where in Paris?
Then let her go.

29
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:18,595
- 'Cause you will not...
- It's not in Paris. Five.

30
00:02:20,506 --> 00:02:22,133
I can get it for you.

31
00:02:22,241 --> 00:02:24,141
But you kill her, you do this,
you get nothing.

32
00:02:24,243 --> 00:02:26,473
- Six.
- Are you listening to me?

33
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:29,742
The only way you're going
to get what you want is for you to...

34
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:31,942
- Do you think I'm playing?
- Son of a bitch!

35
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:34,383
Do you think I'm playing?
You don't think I'll do it?

36
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,318
Where is it? Where the hell is it?

37
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:37,889
- Look at me.
- Where the hell is it?

38
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,390
- Stay with me.
- Seven! Seven!

39
00:02:40,526 --> 00:02:45,020
I am going to kill you.
I swear to God I'm going to kill you!

40
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:47,189
- Eight!
- No, please.

41
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:56,033
Please. Don't do this. Just let her go.

42
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,976
I promise you. I promise you.

43
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,742
- I can figure out how to get whatever...
- Nine.

44
00:03:04,917 --> 00:03:07,044
Listen to me. Listen to me.

45
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:10,518
I want to help you.

46
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,350
I want to help you get
whatever you want.

47
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:17,156
But you got to do what's right.
What you know is right.

48
00:03:23,402 --> 00:03:26,030
No. No.

49
00:03:29,775 --> 00:03:30,833
No.

50
00:03:30,943 --> 00:03:31,655
- Ten.
- Don't!

51
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:32,368
- Ten.
- Don't!

52
00:04:10,649 --> 00:04:12,583
- What are you doing?
- Your brother wants another one.

53
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:14,346
Oh, God, no.
Ethan, that's what we talked about...

54
00:04:14,453 --> 00:04:16,421
- I'm watching him. He's fine.
- That's how it is with Rick.

55
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:19,082
He's fine and then suddenly he's naked
and he's hugging everybody.

56
00:04:19,191 --> 00:04:22,058
- I'll take full responsibility for Rick.
- You will? Full?

57
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:24,652
- Well, mostly full.
- It's a huge responsibility.

58
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,322
It's going well, right?

59
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,730
- It's going really well.
- Yeah.

60
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,564
Julia, your sister's here.

61
00:04:32,004 --> 00:04:34,472
- Give me a hug.
- You look so beautiful.

62
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,666
I don't know about that. So, is this him?

63
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,404
- I hope so.
- Oh, come here. Oh, gosh.

64
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:42,076
All right. Mom's dying to see you.

65
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:44,206
I can't believe
you guys came all the way to Virginia.

66
00:04:44,316 --> 00:04:45,544
Like we'd miss your engagement...

67
00:04:45,651 --> 00:04:49,485
When Julia called and told me
that she was getting married,

68
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,591
I had one thought,
that it was just too bad

69
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:56,958
that Daddy wasn't here
to walk her down the aisle.

70
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,294
And then when Julia told me...
Thanks, Mom.

71
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,867
That Ethan doesn't have
his parents anymore, either,

72
00:05:02,968 --> 00:05:04,765
I got really sad.

73
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:09,034
But it occurred to me
that this is about starting a new family

74
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:11,104
and how beautiful that is.

75
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,338
And I just want to say
I am making Julia an aunt,

76
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,278
so I expect the same treatment
very, very soon.

77
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:18,645
Cheers!

78
00:05:24,356 --> 00:05:25,653
Department of Transportation?

79
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,953
I've been there over 10 years now.
Wow.

80
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,618
What do you do at the DOT?

81
00:05:29,728 --> 00:05:31,252
I study traffic patterns.

82
00:05:31,363 --> 00:05:33,661
You hit the brakes for a second,
just tap them on the freeway,

83
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:35,631
you can literally track
the ripple effect of that action

84
00:05:35,734 --> 00:05:37,258
across a 200-mile stretch of road,

85
00:05:37,369 --> 00:05:38,666
because traffic has a memory.

86
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:40,762
It's amazing. It's like a living organism.

87
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:42,568
Freshen that up for you?
What is it, vodka martini?

88
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:43,767
Yeah. Thanks.

89
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:45,810
Ladies, do you need...

90
00:05:49,281 --> 00:05:50,839
- I'd marry him.
- I would, too.

91
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,783
Okay, so, a three-week
heli-boarding honeymoon?

92
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,820
- Okay, you actually get dropped...
- From a helicopter, yeah.

93
00:05:56,922 --> 00:05:58,890
- It's how they met.
- Really?

94
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:00,856
- Tell her the story.
- There's no story.

95
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,552
It is a good story. Tell the story.

96
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:05,721
First of all,
no one was ever good enough for Julia.

97
00:06:05,831 --> 00:06:07,059
Oh, here we go.

98
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:11,102
Not spontaneous enough,
adventurous enough, funny enough...

99
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:14,001
You know what? No, that's not true.
You make it sound like I've never dated.

100
00:06:14,106 --> 00:06:15,130
No one we liked.

101
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:17,038
- That is true.
- That is true.

102
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,423
Then she goes and gets in a chopper
that takes off from this lake...

103
00:06:34,526 --> 00:06:37,324
- What was the name of that lake?
- Lake...

104
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,798
Lake Wanaka. Wanaka.

105
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,295
Wanaka. Thank you.

106
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,165
- Oh, he heard that?
- How did he hear that?

107
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:48,240
And the hospital's cool
with you taking three weeks?

108
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,332
Yeah, I'm not the only nurse
employed there, you know.

109
00:07:17,002 --> 00:07:19,300
I'm psyched that you're going
to be my brother, man.

110
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:20,429
So am I, Rick.

111
00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:22,404
No, it's awesome.
I think it's going to be sick.

112
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:24,908
Me, too, man.
I just got to get the phone.

113
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,841
- You rock hard.
- Okay.

114
00:07:27,913 --> 00:07:28,971
Hello?

115
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:31,174
<i>- Is this Mr. Ethan Hunt?
- Yes, it is.</i>

116
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:33,785
<i>This is Ready-Travel Resort Services.</i>

117
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:38,516
<i>We'd like to offer you a chance to win
an all-expense-paid trip to Mexico.</i>

118
00:07:57,209 --> 00:07:59,234
We ran out of ice.
I'll be back in 10 minutes.

119
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:01,609
- Oh, no. Can't somebody else go?
- No, I got it.

120
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:03,648
I'll be right back. Hi, Betsy.

121
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:05,080
Thank you.

122
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,201
$1.86.

123
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:37,579
Thanks for coming.
Can't decide what size Slurpee to get.

124
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,684
I usually go for the 900-ouncer.

125
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:45,049
How's that party? Sorry I had to call you.

126
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:47,148
- Yeah, you should have come.
- You should have invited me.

127
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:49,625
- You know I would have.
- Thanks.

128
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:55,225
I know we joke about it, but I am always
this close to begging you

129
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,700
to stop training our people
and get your ass back in the field.

130
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:00,670
But that's not what you do anymore,
and so I respect that choice.

131
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:04,903
You know I do. Family's everything.

132
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:09,478
Come on, John. What's going on?

133
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,148
It's Agent Farris.

134
00:09:15,754 --> 00:09:17,779
She was on an operation.

135
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,926
She's disappeared.
Been off-grid 11 hours.

136
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:27,565
I'm sending in Search and Rescue.
I was hoping you'd want in.

137
00:09:32,337 --> 00:09:34,703
You've got good people for that.

138
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,337
Yeah. Yep, that we do.

139
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:44,349
Wheels up at sunrise
if you have a change of heart.

140
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,681
Take some pictures of the party for me.

141
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:09,135
<i>Ethan. Three days ago,</i>

142
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:12,733
<i>Agent Lindsey Farris was captured
while on a surveillance operation.</i>

143
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:15,575
<i>This is the man she was tracking.
His name is Owen Davian.</i>

144
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:16,978
<i>Details are eyes-only,</i>

145
00:10:17,082 --> 00:10:19,846
<i>but I can tell you
that Davian's a black-market trafficker.</i>

146
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,853
<i>Extremely dangerous
and a priority for us.</i>

147
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:24,917
<i>At 1400 hours today,</i>

148
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:27,184
<i>a recon satellite ID'd
a caravan of vehicles</i>

149
00:10:27,292 --> 00:10:30,921
<i>with plates matching those known to
have been used by Davian's operatives.</i>

150
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:33,589
<i>They stopped at a derelict factory
outside Berlin.</i>

151
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:36,964
<i>It appears they have a hostage.
We believe it's Agent Farris.</i>

152
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:39,162
<i>Normally we would disavow,</i>

153
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:41,330
<i>but Lindsey may be the key
to getting us closer to Davian,</i>

154
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,135
<i>and that's a risk we need to take.</i>

155
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:45,938
<i>Your mission,
should you choose to accept it,</i>

156
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:48,603
<i>is to find Lindsey and bring her home.</i>

157
00:10:48,747 --> 00:10:50,977
<i>I've already assembled a team.</i>

158
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,978
<i>I have them standing by,
awaiting your word.</i>

159
00:10:54,753 --> 00:10:59,053
<i>This message, let's call it
my excellent engagement gift to you,</i>

160
00:10:59,591 --> 00:11:01,218
<i>will self-destruct in five seconds.</i>

161
00:11:01,326 --> 00:11:03,920
<i>Good luck, Ethan, and thanks again.</i>

162
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,039
<i>Am I ready?</i>

163
00:11:33,525 --> 00:11:35,925
- You okay?
- Yeah.

164
00:11:37,796 --> 00:11:39,058
Yeah.

165
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:56,645
You know, I'm sorry. I realized
I didn't tell you that the office called

166
00:11:57,549 --> 00:11:59,949
during the party.
I have to go to Houston for a night.

167
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:03,954
METRO's having
a public transpo conference.

168
00:12:07,025 --> 00:12:10,517
- It's so last-minute.
- I know.

169
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,883
Well, well, well.

170
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:42,653
Now, if it isn't
Mr. "Those Who Can't Do, Teach"

171
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:44,285
back in the field.

172
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:46,557
- What's up, baby?
- Hey, man.

173
00:12:47,432 --> 00:12:50,959
Hey, Ethan, don't worry.
We're going to get the girl.

174
00:12:51,503 --> 00:12:55,234
Or have you been away so long
you've forgotten how good we are?

175
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:58,167
Welcome back, brother.

176
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:23,967
Is our truck in place?

177
00:13:24,102 --> 00:13:25,194
Weapons good to go?

178
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,033
- Yeah. You?
- Yeah.

179
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:29,100
You know I got your six.

180
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:31,641
Hey, man. That's your job.

181
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:56,059
<i>Guns one, activated.
Guns two, activated.</i>

182
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:59,160
<i>Guns three, activated.
Guns four, activated.</i>

183
00:14:00,205 --> 00:14:01,638
<i>Guns ready.</i>

184
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:09,508
All four guns operational.

185
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:13,311
They've got men on
the second, third, fourth floors.

186
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,816
<i>I count 14 of them.</i>

187
00:14:16,955 --> 00:14:19,048
Observer, I'm in approach position.

188
00:14:19,157 --> 00:14:21,022
Roger that. Stand by.

189
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,426
<i>Target match.</i>

190
00:14:27,532 --> 00:14:30,433
The prize is on the sixth floor.
Two Tangos with her.

191
00:14:30,802 --> 00:14:32,133
Moving in.

192
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,779
<i>So, Raider One, at some point,</i>

193
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:53,289
we got to go over
this whole "getting married" thing.

194
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,189
Negative, Observer.

195
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:58,125
I don't respect you nearly enough
to have that conversation.

196
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,390
<i>You may not respect me,</i>

197
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:01,625
<i>but for now you're stuck
with my voice in your head.</i>

198
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:04,634
So, this girl,
what the hell do you see in her anyway?

199
00:15:04,736 --> 00:15:07,899
Who, Julia? You've never met her.

200
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:10,906
Yeah, and the way things are,
I probably never will.

201
00:15:11,109 --> 00:15:14,078
<i>Lucky for her, right?
That's what you're thinking.</i>

202
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:16,012
They've got communications gear.

203
00:15:16,114 --> 00:15:19,083
Two Tangos, second floor,
northwest corridor.

204
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:20,918
Groundhog, that's you.

205
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:22,646
<i>You need to grab that gear
on the second floor</i>

206
00:15:22,754 --> 00:15:24,119
<i>as soon as we go hot.</i>

207
00:15:24,222 --> 00:15:26,713
Copy that. I'll need two minutes,

208
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:28,591
which means
you'll need me in one, right?

209
00:15:28,693 --> 00:15:30,251
Yeah, just about.

210
00:15:30,395 --> 00:15:32,693
Raider One,
make a left at the top of the stairs.

211
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:35,733
<i>The prize should be
at the end of the hall.</i>

212
00:15:54,252 --> 00:15:56,379
Phoenix, I have eye on the prize.

213
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:58,422
Give her 10 cc's more.

214
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:05,861
- Call me when she wakes.
- Okay.

215
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:08,561
We need touchdown in less than three.
Do you copy?

216
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,100
<i>Roger that, I copy.</i>

217
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:13,261
Please, when do I not copy?
All I do is copy.

218
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:19,975
Stand by to go live. On my mark.

219
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:22,205
<i>Three.</i>

220
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,372
<i>Two.</i>

221
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,211
One. Execute.

222
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,121
<i>Warning. Warning.</i>

223
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:58,783
Raider One, you're clear. Move!

224
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:08,626
Lindsey. Lindsey.

225
00:17:10,328 --> 00:17:11,556
Ethan?

226
00:17:13,164 --> 00:17:15,189
I'm going to get you home.

227
00:17:19,771 --> 00:17:22,001
Observer, I've got the prize.
Evac in three.

228
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:23,540
<i>Roger that.</i>

229
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:33,210
This is adrenaline.
Lindsey, you're going to feel this.

230
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:52,232
<i>Groundhog, second floor is clear.</i>

231
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:53,837
On the move!

232
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:18,763
Observer, we're on the move. Wrap out.

233
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:21,058
<i>- Evac in 90 seconds.
- Roger that.</i>

234
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,929
Phoenix, get to the LZ now.

235
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:25,229
Roger, Observer. On my way.

236
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:44,078
Ethan. I have to talk to you.

237
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:46,089
- Come on, come on.
- I have to talk to you right now!

238
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:49,285
Just for you. Turn off your transmitter.

239
00:18:50,428 --> 00:18:51,952
Do it, Ethan!

240
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,634
Ethan!

241
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:14,982
- Lindsey! Moving!
- Moving!

242
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:28,324
Mag!

243
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:31,291
Ready to move.

244
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,225
We evac from here.

245
00:19:57,395 --> 00:19:58,726
Get down!

246
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:07,628
I'm out. How many rounds you got?

247
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,303
Enough.

248
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:23,584
Now I'm out.

249
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,391
T minus five, baby.

250
00:20:40,972 --> 00:20:42,997
Lindsey, hold on to me.

251
00:21:04,395 --> 00:21:05,623
Luther!

252
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,728
Rolling!

253
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,784
God! My head! What is that?

254
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,652
- What is...
- Is she okay?

255
00:21:38,763 --> 00:21:40,890
Lindsey! Let's get to the chopper.

256
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:42,523
Zhen, get rid of the truck.

257
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:43,965
Let's go!

258
00:21:50,608 --> 00:21:53,338
God! What is that? You can't hear that?

259
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:56,245
- Oh! God!
- What's wrong with her?

260
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,078
- Let's go!
- We loaded?

261
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:01,448
Yeah. Let's do it! Move out!

262
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,789
Go, go, go, go, go!

263
00:22:30,548 --> 00:22:32,311
- Son of a bitch.
- No!

264
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:35,783
Guys, we got company.
I'm going to try and lose them.

265
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:37,411
Hurts so much.

266
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:40,853
Turn it off. Please.

267
00:22:57,675 --> 00:22:59,302
Please, Ethan.

268
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:12,619
Guys, their missiles are hot!

269
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:19,125
Incoming! Hold on.

270
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:33,203
Okay. That was lucky.
We only get one of those.

271
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,581
Do we have a defibrillator?

272
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,521
Ethan, turn it off!

273
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:50,494
Bring it on!

274
00:23:53,097 --> 00:23:55,793
Ethan! What is it?
Did they put something in my head?

275
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,834
They injected you
with a time-release charge.

276
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,460
- Do you remember that?
- No. Time-release...

277
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:00,935
An explosive. They've activated it.

278
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,438
It's gonna detonate
unless we fry the charge,

279
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,700
- which is what we're gonna do.
- No, Ethan.

280
00:24:03,808 --> 00:24:05,173
Zap her like that, you'll stop her heart.

281
00:24:05,276 --> 00:24:07,836
Then I'll zap her again
and bring her back.

282
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,038
Do it!

283
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:11,240
Guys! They're firing another one!

284
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:20,684
- Ethan!
- Zhen!

285
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,260
Zhen, hold on. Hold on, hold on!

286
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:47,979
- I want you to set it for 150.
- 150.

287
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:49,815
Lindsey, I'm gonna short out
the explosive in your head.

288
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:51,889
- You're gonna be okay.
- It'll need 30 seconds.

289
00:24:53,157 --> 00:24:54,454
Damn it.

290
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:56,756
- Twenty-five seconds!
- Come on.

291
00:24:56,861 --> 00:24:58,658
We're almost there.

292
00:25:02,266 --> 00:25:04,234
- They have us locked.
- Twenty seconds.

293
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:07,165
Hold on.

294
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:25,516
I got them!

295
00:25:25,656 --> 00:25:28,090
- Ten seconds.
- Almost there. Almost there.

296
00:25:28,292 --> 00:25:29,782
Give me the paddles.

297
00:25:29,894 --> 00:25:32,362
Ethan. Thank you.

298
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:08,660
Shit.

299
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:46,895
Hey.

300
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:49,799
Hey.

301
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:58,905
How did it go?

302
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:05,414
I'm sorry. Fine. I'm sorry.

303
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:07,649
I'm just tired.

304
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:39,249
I read your training brief
on Agent Farris.

305
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,790
The words you used were
"beyond capable."

306
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:43,291
That still stand, Mr. Hunt?

307
00:27:43,394 --> 00:27:45,726
- Mr. Brassel...
- Does it stand?

308
00:27:46,497 --> 00:27:47,691
Yes, sir, it does.

309
00:27:47,798 --> 00:27:51,029
Because we've got a corpse downstairs
that says otherwise.

310
00:27:51,135 --> 00:27:52,796
Killed by a detonator

311
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:56,134
implanted in her skull
through the nasal cavity.

312
00:27:57,308 --> 00:28:00,471
Mr. Brassel, it's unacceptable to judge
Agent Farris' competence based...

313
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:02,671
It's unacceptable
that chocolate makes you fat,

314
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,805
but I've eaten my share.
And guess what?

315
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:07,248
Now, I approved Agent Farris'
surveillance op

316
00:28:07,351 --> 00:28:09,478
based on your evaluations, Mr. Hunt,

317
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:12,020
of a woman
who allowed herself to be captured.

318
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:15,092
So you go to recover her.
You encounter a dozen men.

319
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,854
You don't grab any of them?

320
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:20,590
Our objective, Mr. Brassel,
was to recover Agent Farris.

321
00:28:21,532 --> 00:28:23,693
Davian employs a cellular structure
at his organization.

322
00:28:23,801 --> 00:28:25,860
The men there
more than likely had no information...

323
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,962
Who's drawing these conclusions?
Is it you?

324
00:28:29,106 --> 00:28:32,234
- I am, sir. Based upon...
- I'm not on you yet.

325
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:35,445
You allowed Farris
to board your chopper without a scan.

326
00:28:35,546 --> 00:28:37,605
That explosive device
could have taken you all out.

327
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:42,175
There is one reason that you are sitting
here before me today, and that is luck.

328
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,586
Because your operation was
poorly conceived and executed worse.

329
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:49,023
- Two laptops were recovered...
- I'm aware of that.

330
00:28:49,126 --> 00:28:50,457
We've talked to Tech Services.

331
00:28:50,561 --> 00:28:52,927
They doubt
if they can reconstitute the drives.

332
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:56,295
"Crispy," I believe,
is what they called them. Worthless.

333
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,698
Mr. Brassel,
as Operation Manager of this office,

334
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:00,236
- I have the authority...
- Excuse me.

335
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:03,364
Did you just throw a title at me,
Mr. Musgrave?

336
00:29:03,507 --> 00:29:06,840
I don't care if your daddy plays golf
with the President.

337
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:10,038
This is Intelligence.
So far I haven't seen any.

338
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:13,309
You think this op was worth the risk,
Mr. Hunt.

339
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,846
What do you know about Owen Davian?

340
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,447
He was the one
who brought gas centrifuge technology

341
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:22,617
to Korea from Pakistan.

342
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:26,891
He was also the man who sold Toxin
Five to the Armahad Republic Jihad.

343
00:29:27,331 --> 00:29:31,563
He is a man who provides,
provides, provides!

344
00:29:32,903 --> 00:29:36,566
And he remains invisible.
He's a goddamn invisible man.

345
00:29:36,707 --> 00:29:39,642
Wells, not Ellison,
in case you want to be cute again.

346
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:41,507
We can't find him.

347
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:46,081
He knows it. It's emboldened him.

348
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:49,978
I've been trying to bring Davian down
since the day that I got here.

349
00:29:50,087 --> 00:29:51,281
Do you know what I've got for it?

350
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:53,619
It's never been confirmed
the Toxin Five theft was Davian.

351
00:29:53,724 --> 00:29:57,751
Mr. Musgrave, please don't interrupt me
when I'm asking rhetorical questions.

352
00:29:57,862 --> 00:29:59,955
Your operation has achieved one thing.

353
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:03,261
You have reminded Davian
that he is winning.

354
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:07,761
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go inform Mr. and Mrs. Farris

355
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:11,740
that their baby girl was killed
in a head-on collision on I-95.

356
00:30:13,811 --> 00:30:16,336
<i>I stand here today deeply saddened</i>

357
00:30:16,647 --> 00:30:19,411
by the death of one of God's children,

358
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:22,248
Lindsey Elizabeth Farris.

359
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:27,788
It is always startling when the Lord
takes one of our young so unexpectedly.

360
00:30:28,926 --> 00:30:33,954
<i>Be aggressive. Come on. Stay focused.
Keep your knees bent. Good. Good.</i>

361
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:36,157
<i>Now, to fire the lock,
the extractor has to be...</i>

362
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:38,201
<i>That bag's not going to hit you back.
Hit harder.</i>

363
00:30:38,302 --> 00:30:40,702
<i>Don't rely on your sights.
Keep your eyes dead on the target...</i>

364
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:42,397
<i>Attack me. Come on.</i>

365
00:30:42,506 --> 00:30:45,634
<i>Don't ever release the firing pin
unless the extractor's...</i>

366
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:47,802
<i>Good. There you go. Good.</i>

367
00:30:48,145 --> 00:30:52,411
<i>Identify the target. Point and shoot.
It's very simple. You point and shoot.</i>

368
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,608
<i>Stay focused.</i>

369
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:56,710
<i>Miss Farris, you know
how many recruits I've trained.</i>

370
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:58,686
<i>I'm proud to say that you are the first</i>

371
00:30:58,789 --> 00:31:01,417
<i>that I've recommended
for active field duty.</i>

372
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:02,890
<i>Congratulations.</i>

373
00:31:02,993 --> 00:31:04,392
<i>Am I ready?</i>

374
00:31:10,601 --> 00:31:11,693
Yes?

375
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:13,866
<i>Is this Mr. Kelvin?</i>

376
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:18,270
Yes. Who is this?

377
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:20,708
<i>I'm calling from Norfolk Mail Service.</i>

378
00:31:20,811 --> 00:31:23,245
<i>Lindsey Farris
rents a post office box here.</i>

379
00:31:23,347 --> 00:31:24,974
<i>She sent you a piece of mail from Berlin</i>

380
00:31:25,082 --> 00:31:26,982
<i>and asked us to call you
when it arrived.</i>

381
00:31:27,084 --> 00:31:28,949
<i>It came this morning.</i>

382
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:34,655
Thank you.

383
00:31:38,462 --> 00:31:40,555
- This right here.
- Thanks.

384
00:31:57,982 --> 00:31:58,627
<i>It's a microdot.</i>

385
00:31:58,662 --> 00:31:59,272
<i>It's a microdot.</i>

386
00:31:59,383 --> 00:32:01,681
A microdot with nothing on it.
This is unusual.

387
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:03,777
Lindsey wouldn't send me
a blank microdot.

388
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:05,446
I'm telling you, man, there's no image.

389
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:06,887
Then you're not looking
in the right place.

390
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:08,458
Where the hell am I supposed to look?

391
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,026
There's not much square footage
to this thing.

392
00:32:10,127 --> 00:32:11,560
Why would Lindsey send me
a blank microdot?

393
00:32:11,662 --> 00:32:13,425
I don't know.
Why would Lindsey send you anything?

394
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:16,193
You were her instructor,
not her handler.

395
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:19,927
Listen, man.
I don't mean to cross the line,

396
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:23,969
but was there something going on
between you two?

397
00:32:24,074 --> 00:32:25,769
You and Lindsey.

398
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,801
Lindsey was like my little sister.

399
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,847
And you never

400
00:32:31,882 --> 00:32:34,680
slept with your little sister, right?

401
00:32:37,721 --> 00:32:40,451
Hey, brother, if I don't ask you, who will?

402
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:43,049
Maybe it's magnetic. The microdot.

403
00:32:43,894 --> 00:32:45,555
Well, that's old school.

404
00:32:45,696 --> 00:32:49,154
If she was in a hurry and only had
access to black-market gear, maybe.

405
00:32:49,266 --> 00:32:51,496
- Could you get the tools to read it?
- I might know a guy.

406
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:54,002
- Magnetic means encrypted.
- Yeah, I know that.

407
00:32:54,104 --> 00:32:56,766
Yeah. Be right there.

408
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:00,076
The thing about Lindsey is
she was brand-new.

409
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:03,339
She was sweet.
Remember when you were sweet?

410
00:33:03,447 --> 00:33:06,974
- Can you remember that far back?
- Yeah, well, barely.

411
00:33:07,384 --> 00:33:10,842
In Germany,
you asked me what it is I see in Julia.

412
00:33:11,355 --> 00:33:14,381
What I see in Julia is life before all this.

413
00:33:15,192 --> 00:33:16,853
And it's good.

414
00:33:19,196 --> 00:33:20,629
Benji, what have you got?

415
00:33:20,731 --> 00:33:22,961
Well, these hard drive platters
are just fried.

416
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:24,830
- Yeah.
- You know, they made a mess of them.

417
00:33:24,935 --> 00:33:26,334
It's just like...
There's holes in them and stuff.

418
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:28,337
And it's got scorched
all the way through. And then...

419
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:29,997
Look, this one's got
a hole in it and stuff.

420
00:33:30,107 --> 00:33:31,369
I can't believe. I can't even look at it.

421
00:33:31,475 --> 00:33:33,670
- Benji. Did you recover anything?
- Yes. Yes.

422
00:33:33,777 --> 00:33:36,678
Despite the aforementioned conditions
of the hard drive you brought back,

423
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:41,342
I managed to recover
portions of two dozen e-mail files.

424
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:42,976
Also made what I believe to be

425
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:46,056
a thoroughly
promotion-worthy breakthrough.

426
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:49,950
Your Mr. Davian is going
to arrive in Rome the day after tomorrow

427
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:53,086
and attend a function
at one Vatican City.

428
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:55,357
What the hell is Davian
doing at the Vatican?

429
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:57,491
It's all got to do with the "Rabbit's Foot."

430
00:33:57,601 --> 00:33:58,693
Rabbit's Foot?

431
00:33:58,802 --> 00:34:00,497
Yeah, well,
I'm assuming it's like a code word

432
00:34:00,604 --> 00:34:02,731
for something he's about to sell
to an unspecified buyer,

433
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,435
for $850 million, by the way.
Or maybe it's not a code word.

434
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:09,239
Maybe it's just a really,
really expensive bunny appendage.

435
00:34:09,346 --> 00:34:10,870
You have no idea what it is?

436
00:34:10,981 --> 00:34:13,711
It's interesting. I used to have
this professor at Oxford, okay?

437
00:34:13,817 --> 00:34:16,911
Dr. Wickham, his name was,
and he was like this massive, fat guy.

438
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:19,387
You know, huge, big guy.
We used to call him...

439
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:21,253
You know... Well, I won't tell you
what we used to call him.

440
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:24,088
He taught biomolecular kinetics
and cellular dynamics,

441
00:34:24,194 --> 00:34:26,219
and he used to sort of
scare the underclassmen

442
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:29,493
with this story about how the world
would eventually be eviscerated

443
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,931
by technology.

444
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:34,493
You see, it was inevitable
that a compound would be created,

445
00:34:34,638 --> 00:34:37,129
which he referred to as the "Anti-God."

446
00:34:37,274 --> 00:34:39,504
It was like an accelerated mutator,
a sort of, you know,

447
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:42,670
like an unstoppable force
of destructive power

448
00:34:42,813 --> 00:34:44,542
that would just lay waste to everything.

449
00:34:44,648 --> 00:34:46,843
To buildings and parks
and streets and children

450
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:49,442
and ice cream parlors, you know?

451
00:34:49,653 --> 00:34:52,417
So whenever I see, like,
a rogue organization,

452
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:56,186
willing to spend this amount of money
on a mystery tech,

453
00:34:56,827 --> 00:34:59,660
I always assume it's the Anti-God.

454
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:04,027
End-of-the-world kind of stuff,
you know?

455
00:35:05,769 --> 00:35:08,932
But, no, I don't have any idea what it is.
I was just speculating.

456
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:11,405
- Did you brief Musgrave on this?
- Who, me? No, not yet.

457
00:35:11,508 --> 00:35:13,169
- Good. Don't.
- What?

458
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:15,039
- Don't tell anyone about this.
- This took me ages.

459
00:35:15,145 --> 00:35:16,544
If something goes wrong
with the operation,

460
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:19,081
I want Musgrave to have deniability.

461
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:21,777
- That's great work, Benji.
- What operation?

462
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,054
That look in your eye
is a pain in my ass.

463
00:35:25,155 --> 00:35:27,020
You know that, right?

464
00:35:28,225 --> 00:35:30,989
<i>Any available resident to Pediatrics.</i>

465
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:34,391
<i>Any available resident to Pediatrics.</i>

466
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,064
<i>Rehabilitative Care, call the pharmacy.</i>

467
00:35:40,871 --> 00:35:42,862
<i>Rehabilitative Care, call the...</i>

468
00:35:43,807 --> 00:35:45,866
I have to go away again.

469
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:50,341
On business. Two days.

470
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:53,046
Two days?

471
00:35:54,151 --> 00:35:55,277
Yeah.

472
00:36:01,925 --> 00:36:03,893
Ethan, what's going on?

473
00:36:05,562 --> 00:36:08,087
I keep thinking you just need time

474
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:13,434
to tell me whatever it is that it's...

475
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:20,035
But nothing in my mind makes sense.

476
00:36:22,746 --> 00:36:23,906
Yeah.

477
00:36:27,951 --> 00:36:29,441
What's wrong?

478
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:39,692
What are you not telling me?

479
00:37:06,356 --> 00:37:08,620
I need to ask you for something.

480
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:11,159
And it's the most...

481
00:37:20,804 --> 00:37:22,431
I need you to trust me.

482
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:27,007
Of course I trust you.

483
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:35,077
Am I ever going to be able
to understand what this is?

484
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:40,513
I need you to trust me.

485
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:47,823
Yes.

486
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:50,666
I trust you.

487
00:37:53,837 --> 00:37:55,031
Is it...

488
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:57,836
Tell me it's real.

489
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:04,712
I mean us.

490
00:38:06,316 --> 00:38:08,011
Tell me it's real.

491
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:12,186
Follow me.

492
00:38:13,657 --> 00:38:15,056
<i>The vows you're about to take</i>

493
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:18,720
are not to be taken
without careful thought and prayer.

494
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:23,798
This love is not to be diminished
by difficult circumstances

495
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:26,995
and it is only to be dissolved by death.

496
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:30,871
Do you have the rings?

497
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:32,301
Yeah.

498
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:48,418
Repeat after me.

499
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:57,496
I, Julia Anne Meade...

500
00:38:58,702 --> 00:39:01,762
"I, Julia Anne Meade..."

501
00:39:02,272 --> 00:39:05,332
...hereby take Ethan Matthew Hunt...

502
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:09,040
"...hereby take Ethan Matthew Hunt..."

503
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:11,840
...to be my lawfully wedded husband.

504
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:14,913
"...to be my lawfully wedded husband."

505
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:34,233
Tomorrow may be the only time
we can predict

506
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:35,896
where Owen Davian is going to be.

507
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:37,530
Charity event. Vatican City.

508
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:40,633
Our mission is to get in
and kidnap Davian.

509
00:39:40,777 --> 00:39:43,143
I don't know why he's so happy.

510
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,745
I did remind him
that the Vatican is the Vatican.

511
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:50,952
A 109-acre sovereign state
in the middle of Rome,

512
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:54,649
surrounded by a 60-foot wall,
which is monitored 24/7,

513
00:39:54,791 --> 00:39:57,225
with over 200 CCTV cameras.

514
00:39:58,462 --> 00:40:00,828
That's not even
what makes it a challenge.

515
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:05,129
Getting Davian is good.
But getting his buyers is even better.

516
00:40:05,802 --> 00:40:09,294
If they realize he's been grabbed,
they'll disappear.

517
00:40:09,439 --> 00:40:11,464
I'm sorry, what are you saying?

518
00:40:11,608 --> 00:40:12,905
No matter how we grab Davian,

519
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,841
his clients are gonna know
he's been taken.

520
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:17,778
No, they won't. Access point is here.

521
00:40:18,148 --> 00:40:21,174
It's a one-way street
adjacent to the Vatican wall.

522
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:24,481
I'll need 30 seconds.
And we'll need a truck.

523
00:41:01,591 --> 00:41:03,149
Now we've pissed off
every Italian in Rome,

524
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,318
go do what you got to do.

525
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:06,794
- Don't forget the smoke.
- Yeah.

526
00:41:48,905 --> 00:41:50,202
"Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall."

527
00:43:04,514 --> 00:43:07,176
Alpha team, this is Bravo.
Right on schedule.

528
00:43:08,051 --> 00:43:10,110
<i>We should have breach in 60.</i>

529
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,848
Roger that. Charlie team, report.

530
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:15,482
<i>Well, I don't have anything
to report, really.</i>

531
00:43:18,795 --> 00:43:20,763
Except I think I should be right on time.

532
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:21,922
We'll be waiting for you.

533
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:24,762
<i>- ETA two minutes.
- Roger that.</i>

534
00:43:56,366 --> 00:43:57,993
Charlie team, did you fire the tracer yet?

535
00:43:59,369 --> 00:44:00,700
Stand by.

536
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:17,653
Firing the tracer. Now.

537
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:26,588
Alpha, I'm in. T minus two minutes.

538
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:28,095
Roger that.

539
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:32,095
Charlie team, I see you.

540
00:44:32,602 --> 00:44:34,968
<i>I'm looping the security feed.
Stand by to move.</i>

541
00:44:35,071 --> 00:44:36,436
Roger that.

542
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:39,607
Video is looped. Go.

543
00:44:53,723 --> 00:44:56,055
Alpha team,
catacomb video taken care of?

544
00:44:56,159 --> 00:44:58,184
Taken care of. We're good to go.

545
00:45:06,636 --> 00:45:10,037
<i>- Delta team, do you copy?
- All I do is copy.</i>

546
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:13,640
That's funny.
Get ready to move into position.

547
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:16,211
<i>- I'm already there.
- Really?</i>

548
00:45:18,848 --> 00:45:20,406
<i>ETA 30 seconds.</i>

549
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:22,075
See you in 30.

550
00:45:31,628 --> 00:45:33,095
Alpha team moving into position.

551
00:45:33,196 --> 00:45:34,959
Bravo standing by for transmission.

552
00:45:37,033 --> 00:45:38,125
Transmitting.

553
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:42,800
Got you.

554
00:45:57,554 --> 00:45:59,021
Miss Onia Demea.

555
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,724
I should be on the list. Thank you.

556
00:46:02,859 --> 00:46:04,156
I'm sorry. Your name is not here.

557
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:06,092
There must be some mistake.

558
00:46:15,071 --> 00:46:16,095
Miss Demea?

559
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:18,431
Just a minute.

560
00:46:54,778 --> 00:46:56,211
She made it.

561
00:47:17,767 --> 00:47:19,200
We have a photo opportunity.

562
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:22,331
<i>Just give me the word. I'm standing by.</i>

563
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:24,066
Delta, ready for upload.

564
00:47:41,057 --> 00:47:43,116
Delta team, download good.

565
00:47:54,337 --> 00:47:57,033
Listen, man, I didn't mean to be
so cavalier the other day

566
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:58,664
about you getting engaged.

567
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:01,403
I know that. Thanks.

568
00:48:04,347 --> 00:48:07,475
But a normal relationship
isn't viable for people like us.

569
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:10,382
- I don't agree with that.
- Then I'm smarter than you.

570
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:12,978
I'm going up. I agree with Luther.

571
00:48:13,123 --> 00:48:17,059
We can't have real relationships.
But you see, I love that.

572
00:48:42,018 --> 00:48:44,213
Twenty-three months.
That's as long as it'll last

573
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:47,289
when you got the baggage we do
and the lifestyle we got.

574
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:49,324
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

575
00:48:50,393 --> 00:48:53,191
Look at me.
I know what I'm talking about.

576
00:48:53,329 --> 00:48:56,264
And you know
I know what I'm talking about.

577
00:49:08,478 --> 00:49:09,809
Wait here.

578
00:49:31,835 --> 00:49:33,166
Davian just picked up a briefcase.

579
00:49:33,269 --> 00:49:34,998
We're going to have to
move sooner than we thought.

580
00:49:35,104 --> 00:49:38,938
<i>- Can you identify who made the drop?
- Negative. How close are you guys?</i>

581
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:41,101
We're just printing now.

582
00:50:00,396 --> 00:50:02,660
I'm not proud of it.
I'm not happy about it,

583
00:50:02,765 --> 00:50:04,596
but I've lived with women a few times,

584
00:50:04,701 --> 00:50:06,794
and it doesn't ever make it to two years.

585
00:50:06,903 --> 00:50:08,666
- You can't.
- Thanks for the advice,

586
00:50:08,771 --> 00:50:11,296
but it's different for me
than it is for you, you know?

587
00:50:11,407 --> 00:50:13,398
- I'm not in the field anymore.
- Oh, okay.

588
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,705
Here's a retirement present.

589
00:50:18,848 --> 00:50:22,443
In our job, there's always going to be
something between you and a woman.

590
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:23,712
Always.

591
00:50:23,853 --> 00:50:26,048
- Luther, listen.
- Dishonesty.

592
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:28,851
A dishonesty that poisons everything.

593
00:50:28,958 --> 00:50:30,619
I think I need to tell you something...

594
00:50:30,727 --> 00:50:33,594
Stop talking. This isn't about you, Ethan.

595
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:38,256
And whoever this girl is, you're going to
end up messing up her life, too.

596
00:50:38,401 --> 00:50:39,834
Don't do it.

597
00:50:41,237 --> 00:50:43,933
Jules and I got married two days ago.

598
00:50:46,075 --> 00:50:47,702
Congratulations.

599
00:50:48,711 --> 00:50:51,111
Thanks. Thanks.

600
00:50:55,885 --> 00:50:58,718
<i>- He's walking. I'm going in.
- Roger that.</i>

601
00:50:59,889 --> 00:51:01,413
I'm on my way.

602
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:07,961
Ma'am. I need you to step back.

603
00:51:08,097 --> 00:51:09,997
No. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

604
00:51:10,099 --> 00:51:12,499
I always spill red wine
on my white custom-made shirt.

605
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:15,901
- Okay. Step back.
- It's fine. It's fine. Bathroom.

606
00:51:18,641 --> 00:51:20,074
Tell me you're on your way.

607
00:51:20,176 --> 00:51:21,871
I'm on the move.

608
00:51:30,954 --> 00:51:32,080
Move it. Come on.

609
00:51:35,658 --> 00:51:37,649
His bodyguards
are checking out the bathroom.

610
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:40,056
I'm almost there.

611
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:21,996
He's going in.

612
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:51,959
Quiet. Read this.

613
00:52:52,101 --> 00:52:53,363
Slowly.

614
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:56,566
Read it.

615
00:52:58,408 --> 00:53:01,741

00:53:53,329 --> 00:53:55,854
Everything is not all right.

See you in the sewer.

00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:56,021
- She's sorry about your shirt.
- That's no problem.

641
00:54:59,362 --> 00:55:02,695
Her hotel has laundry service,
and she'll happily take care of it.

642
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,096
You want to wash my shirt?

643
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,725
What are we going to do

00:55:12,341 --> 00:55:14,206
She'll think of something.

646
00:55:15,178 --> 00:55:16,770
She would like to drive.

647
00:55:16,879 --> 00:55:18,403
Follow me to the hotel.

648
00:55:18,514 --> 00:55:20,311
Sir, would you like us
to watch the case?

649
00:55:20,416 --> 00:55:21,474
No.

650
00:55:22,852 --> 00:55:24,683
- Nice job.
- Thank you.

651
00:56:03,092 --> 00:56:05,560
- What's up?
- Nothing. What's up with you?

652
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:06,923
Nothing.

653
00:56:25,147 --> 00:56:26,671
Blow the car.

654
00:56:28,784 --> 00:56:30,775
Oh. It's such a nice car.

655
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,115
And yet, do it.

Send him in.

661
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:11,221
Ethan Hunt and his team
just grabbed Owen Davian in Rome.

662
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:14,761
They're headed back now.
I thought you should know.

663
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:17,661
You were aware of this operation?

664
00:57:19,802 --> 00:57:21,167
Yes, I was.

665
00:57:22,138 --> 00:57:23,730
Then good work.

666
00:57:27,476 --> 00:57:28,807
Thank you.

667
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:05,104
You're dead, Mr. Davian.

668
00:58:09,852 --> 00:58:11,683
There were witnesses.

669
00:58:15,057 --> 00:58:17,287
That was you in the bathroom.

670
00:58:17,393 --> 00:58:19,122
Now, you're going to tell us everything.

671
00:58:19,228 --> 00:58:21,753
Every buyer you've worked with.
Every organization.

672
00:58:21,864 --> 00:58:23,126
What the hell is your name?

673
00:58:23,232 --> 00:58:25,359
Names, contacts, inventory lists.

674
00:58:25,501 --> 00:58:28,334
You have a wife, girlfriend?

675
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:32,640
It's up to you how this goes.

676
00:58:32,742 --> 00:58:35,643
Because you know
what I'm going to do next?

677
00:58:35,745 --> 00:58:38,077
I'm going to find her, whoever she is,

678
00:58:38,214 --> 00:58:41,479
I'm going to find her,
and I'm going to hurt her.

679
00:58:45,187 --> 00:58:47,121
You were apprehended carrying details

680
00:58:47,223 --> 00:58:50,249
of the location of something
code named the Rabbit's Foot.

681
00:58:50,359 --> 00:58:54,056
I'm going to make her bleed, and cry,
and call out your name.

682
00:58:54,196 --> 00:58:57,893
And you're not going to be
able to do shit. You know why?

683
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:00,493
What is the Rabbit's Foot?

684
00:59:00,603 --> 00:59:02,867
Because you're going to be
this close to dead.

685
00:59:02,972 --> 00:59:04,132
And who is the buyer?

686
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:07,732
And then I'm going to kill you
right in front of her.

687
00:59:08,944 --> 00:59:11,139
- I'm going to ask you one more time.
- What's your name?

688
00:59:11,247 --> 00:59:12,714
- What is the Rabbit's Foot?
- Who are you?

689
00:59:12,815 --> 00:59:13,873
And who is the buyer?

690
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:16,349
You don't have any idea
what the hell is going on, do you?

691
00:59:16,452 --> 00:59:20,889
I mean, you saw what I did to your
little blonde friend at the factory, right?

692
00:59:23,959 --> 00:59:26,393
Well, that was nothing. That was

693
00:59:28,497 --> 00:59:29,623
fun.

694
00:59:33,669 --> 00:59:35,136
That was fun.

695
01:00:06,168 --> 01:00:08,261
What is the Rabbit's Foot?

696
01:00:15,177 --> 01:00:17,668
- Ethan!
- What is the Rabbit's Foot?

697
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:19,579
Ethan, stop!

698
01:00:19,682 --> 01:00:21,115
What is it?

699
01:00:22,351 --> 01:00:23,818
Don't do it!

700
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:27,011
- Ethan!
- What is the Rabbit's Foot?

701
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:30,285
You tell me!

702
01:00:30,392 --> 01:00:32,053
Ethan, stop! Don't do it.

703
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:34,322
This isn't you, man! This isn't you!

704
01:00:34,497 --> 01:00:37,193
We can use him, Ethan! You know that!

705
01:00:43,639 --> 01:00:45,607
No, Ethan! Don't do it!

706
01:00:47,343 --> 01:00:48,810
Please, stop!

707
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:21,670
What I'm selling,

708
01:01:22,378 --> 01:01:24,369
and who I'm selling to,

709
01:01:27,049 --> 01:01:30,246
is the last thing
you should be concerned about,

710
01:01:32,755 --> 01:01:33,983
Ethan.

711
01:02:32,348 --> 01:02:35,476
Ethan, we got it. Lindsey's microdot.

712
01:02:35,985 --> 01:02:37,748
It's a video file.

713
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:45,151
<i>Ethan, I don't know what they've
told you. I don't know what you think.</i>

714
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:46,853
<i>Just listen to me.</i>

715
01:02:46,962 --> 01:02:49,487
<i>Brassel sent me to Germany
to surveil an exchange,</i>

716
01:02:49,598 --> 01:02:51,623
<i>to ID a man named Owen Davian.</i>

717
01:02:51,767 --> 01:02:54,497
<i>I tagged his phone,
and I intercepted a transmission.</i>

718
01:02:54,603 --> 01:02:57,970
<i>I traced the call through the
IMF network, and this is what came up.</i>

719
01:02:58,073 --> 01:03:01,133
<i>The call to Davian
came from Brassel's office.</i>

720
01:03:02,011 --> 01:03:04,912
<i>It's Brassel.
I think he's working with Davian.</i>

721
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:06,982
<i>I think I'm being set up...</i>

722
01:03:21,196 --> 01:03:22,458
Ethan!

723
01:03:55,125 --> 01:03:56,615
You all right?

724
01:04:04,234 --> 01:04:06,168
Someone call for help!

725
01:04:07,237 --> 01:04:09,535
Does anyone have a cell phone?

726
01:04:43,073 --> 01:04:44,870
Everybody, get down!

727
01:04:45,442 --> 01:04:48,741
Get down! Get down, get down!
Everybody, get down!

728
01:05:05,062 --> 01:05:07,530
- There's a woman down.
- I see her.

729
01:05:25,048 --> 01:05:27,346
Get down! Get down! Stay down!

730
01:05:28,619 --> 01:05:31,213
Everybody, get down! Get down!
Stay down!

731
01:05:31,321 --> 01:05:32,686
Get down!

732
01:05:36,059 --> 01:05:37,287
Open up!

733
01:05:37,427 --> 01:05:39,725
Open up! I need the prisoner!

734
01:05:55,846 --> 01:05:57,245
Oh, my God!

735
01:05:57,948 --> 01:06:00,348
It's really bleeding.
Don't leave me, okay?

736
01:06:00,450 --> 01:06:02,384
Don't worry. I'm right here.

737
01:06:02,486 --> 01:06:04,818
Ethan, there's a G36 in the truck!

738
01:06:04,955 --> 01:06:05,979
I know! I know!

739
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:39,287
Turn the drone around.
There's an IMF agent in the truck.

740
01:06:47,197 --> 01:06:49,427
Ethan! Get out of the truck!

741
01:06:56,873 --> 01:06:58,306
Ethan, move!

742
01:09:08,772 --> 01:09:11,172
- Hello?
- Rick, this is Ethan. Is Julia home?

743
01:09:11,274 --> 01:09:14,368
Hey, man. Look, I hope you're not mad
I'm here. It's just...

744
01:09:14,478 --> 01:09:15,775
Rick, I'm not mad. Is Julia home?

745
01:09:15,879 --> 01:09:17,813
I tried her cell phone,
and there was no answer.

746
01:09:18,381 --> 01:09:21,976
No. Sorry.
Hey, did your friend find you?

747
01:09:23,787 --> 01:09:25,186
Which friend?

748
01:09:25,322 --> 01:09:27,916
<i>I don't know. Just some English guy.</i>

749
01:09:30,227 --> 01:09:31,592
Rick, what did you tell him?

750
01:09:31,695 --> 01:09:34,562
<i>Look, it's all good, man.
I told him I didn't know where you were,</i>

751
01:09:34,664 --> 01:09:38,122
<i>and Julia might, and he should
just try her at the hospital.</i>

752
01:09:39,836 --> 01:09:40,928
Hello?

753
01:09:47,043 --> 01:09:49,637
- All right, see you tomorrow, Sally.
- All right. Good night, honey.

754
01:09:57,220 --> 01:09:59,620
<i>Hi. It's Julia.
Please leave me a message...</i>

755
01:10:07,197 --> 01:10:11,156
<i>... at 4:00 today, the Chesapeake Bay
Bridge is closed in both directions.</i>

756
01:10:11,268 --> 01:10:13,099
- Sixth floor.
- Sally, this is Ethan.

757
01:10:13,203 --> 01:10:15,262
<i>- I need to talk to Julia.
- Hey, honey.</i>

758
01:10:15,372 --> 01:10:17,067
She just went downstairs.
I'll transfer you.

759
01:10:38,061 --> 01:10:39,255
Damn it!

760
01:10:40,130 --> 01:10:41,188
Excuse me.

761
01:10:41,298 --> 01:10:43,664
I was wondering if you knew
where I might find this patient.

762
01:10:43,767 --> 01:10:46,361
Probably not. But I'll know who can.

763
01:10:51,641 --> 01:10:53,108
What's that?

764
01:11:08,425 --> 01:11:10,359
Sally. Where's Julia?

765
01:11:10,894 --> 01:11:13,260
- Where's Julia?
- I think she left.

766
01:11:13,396 --> 01:11:15,591
Have you tried the east building?

767
01:11:22,138 --> 01:11:24,072
- Has Julia left yet?
- I haven't seen her.

768
01:11:24,174 --> 01:11:26,404
- Mike, Mike. Have you seen Julia?
- Hey, you okay?

769
01:11:26,509 --> 01:11:28,033
- Have you seen Julia?
- No.

770
01:11:32,582 --> 01:11:34,413
Watch it, buddy!

771
01:11:45,095 --> 01:11:47,655
<i>- Jules?
- You hung me outside of an airplane.</i>

772
01:11:47,797 --> 01:11:49,594
<i>You can always tell
someone's character</i>

773
01:11:49,699 --> 01:11:52,224
<i>by the way they treat those
they don't need to treat well.</i>

774
01:11:52,335 --> 01:11:56,237
<i>- If you hurt her, I swear...
- Don't threaten me. Just don't.</i>

775
01:11:56,339 --> 01:12:00,173
<i>The briefcase I picked up in Rome,
the one you took from me,</i>

776
01:12:00,310 --> 01:12:02,403
<i>contains the location
of the Rabbit's Foot.</i>

777
01:12:02,512 --> 01:12:05,913
<i>You're going to get it and bring it to me.
The Rabbit's Foot.</i>

778
01:12:06,016 --> 01:12:08,917
<i>Ethan, you had a watch
last time I saw you.</i>

779
01:12:09,019 --> 01:12:11,783
<i>You have 48 hours,
starting on my mark.</i>

780
01:12:11,888 --> 01:12:13,116
Wait, wait, wait.

781
01:12:13,223 --> 01:12:15,282
<i>Now, call me at this number
when you have it.</i>

782
01:12:15,392 --> 01:12:18,122
<i>- Just wait.
- Julia's life for the Rabbit's Foot.</i>

783
01:12:18,228 --> 01:12:21,629
<i>- You have 48 hours, or she dies.
- Wait! Wait. Wait.</i>

784
01:12:26,336 --> 01:12:28,634
<i>Condition 1-116. All units on scene.</i>

785
01:12:28,738 --> 01:12:30,672
We need you to come with us.

786
01:12:30,807 --> 01:12:33,139
Just... Pete, what the hell is this?

787
01:12:33,243 --> 01:12:35,939
Sorry about that, Mr. Hunt.
We were told to bring you in.

788
01:12:36,046 --> 01:12:38,173
<i>- Okay.
- Get ready to transport.</i>

789
01:12:38,315 --> 01:12:40,078
Whoa. Hey. Just not right now.

790
01:12:40,183 --> 01:12:42,583
- Just tell them you came and that...
- Ethan. Get in.

791
01:12:42,686 --> 01:12:46,053
We don't want to use force here,
and you know we will. Ethan, get in.

792
01:12:46,156 --> 01:12:48,420
- Tell them that you came here...
- Ethan!

793
01:12:48,525 --> 01:12:50,618
...and that I left already, okay?

794
01:12:55,532 --> 01:12:56,726
Freeze!

795
01:12:57,033 --> 01:13:00,161
Ethan, stop! Stop, Ethan!

796
01:13:14,217 --> 01:13:16,014
Yeah. Get his hands.

797
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:46,849
I reviewed the transcript
of your Berlin operation.

798
01:13:46,950 --> 01:13:48,850
It's very interesting.

799
01:13:48,952 --> 01:13:51,011
It seems that Agent Farris
had some information

800
01:13:51,121 --> 01:13:54,352
she wished to share with you
but not with this agency.

801
01:13:54,457 --> 01:13:56,220
Something you failed to report.

802
01:13:56,326 --> 01:13:59,523
You ordered the Vatican operation
without proper approvals.

803
01:13:59,629 --> 01:14:02,063
That mission
resulted in a catastrophic attack.

804
01:14:02,165 --> 01:14:04,065
And then you fled the scene.

805
01:14:04,167 --> 01:14:07,261
Now, I am not a stranger to disrespect.

806
01:14:08,104 --> 01:14:10,971
You don't get to where I am
without developing a thick skin.

807
01:14:11,074 --> 01:14:13,235
But what I won't stand for,

808
01:14:13,610 --> 01:14:16,875
what I will lose sleep over,
and I love my sleep,

809
01:14:17,180 --> 01:14:20,911
is the idea of an irresponsible
rogue agent working in my office.

810
01:14:21,017 --> 01:14:24,783
So I'm going to
slow things way down here.

811
01:14:28,425 --> 01:14:29,892
You can look at me

812
01:14:29,993 --> 01:14:33,156
with those judgmental,
incriminating eyes all you want,

813
01:14:33,296 --> 01:14:34,957
but I bullshit you not.

814
01:14:35,098 --> 01:14:38,898
I will bleed on the flag
to make sure the stripes stay red.

815
01:14:57,954 --> 01:15:00,252
I don't know what to say to you.

816
01:15:01,458 --> 01:15:04,188
Brassel's right. You're out of control.

817
01:15:05,528 --> 01:15:06,961
Look at me.

818
01:15:08,731 --> 01:15:13,031
Ethan, at least show me the courtesy
of looking at me when I'm talking to you.

819
01:15:21,678 --> 01:15:25,910
I intercepted Davian's call. I know he
wants the Rabbit's Foot for Julia's life.

820
01:15:26,015 --> 01:15:27,482
It's just...

821
01:15:29,886 --> 01:15:31,114
This is

822
01:15:31,921 --> 01:15:33,650
<i>so disappointing.</i>

823
01:15:34,290 --> 01:15:37,726
Go to Shanghai.
Feng Shan Apartments... 1406.

824
01:15:42,665 --> 01:15:46,362
I wish there was something I could do
to help you, but...

825
01:15:51,808 --> 01:15:53,639
Take him to the holding cell.

826
01:17:07,483 --> 01:17:08,916
No, I'm on it.

827
01:17:09,052 --> 01:17:11,145
Yes, sir. There's no need to panic.
I'll get him back.

828
01:17:11,254 --> 01:17:12,312
Sir? Ethan Hunt...

829
01:17:12,422 --> 01:17:13,787
I know what happened.
Give me the radio.

830
01:17:13,890 --> 01:17:16,688
This is Director Brassel. Ethan Hunt
is attempting to escape the building.

831
01:17:16,793 --> 01:17:18,784
He's in the west cargo elevator.
He must be stopped.

832
01:17:18,895 --> 01:17:21,659
I want Mendoza and Graham
in the situation room right away.

833
01:17:21,764 --> 01:17:23,493
I'm having the building surrounded, sir.

834
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:25,295
I've got units posted
at all the entrances.

835
01:17:25,401 --> 01:17:28,666
<i>This is Brassel again. I'm ordering
a code-six lockdown. I repeat.</i>

836
01:17:28,771 --> 01:17:31,069
- It's Hunt.
- I know it's Hunt.

837
01:17:32,842 --> 01:17:35,572
Hunt was flagged
on sub-basement nine.

838
01:17:35,678 --> 01:17:38,977
I want all security personnel
down there now.

839
01:17:39,515 --> 01:17:41,176
Security channel's jammed.

840
01:17:41,284 --> 01:17:44,378
Hunt must be holding down
the transmit button.

841
01:18:07,944 --> 01:18:09,741
You've got to be kidding me.

842
01:18:20,456 --> 01:18:24,790
<i>Last call for flight 1162 for Helsinki,
now boarding at gate 46.</i>

843
01:18:27,830 --> 01:18:30,526
<i>Final call for Mr. Bower.
Final call for Mr. Bower.</i>

844
01:18:30,633 --> 01:18:32,191
<i>Please come to gate 4.</i>

845
01:18:33,069 --> 01:18:35,970
- Mr. Pavel Sobo... Sobotka.
- Sobotka.

846
01:18:36,072 --> 01:18:39,132
Sobotka. Okay.
And you're flying to Shanghai?

847
01:18:42,645 --> 01:18:46,308
I don't speak Czech. I'm sorry.
Let's see about your flight.

848
01:18:46,416 --> 01:18:47,610
Okay.

849
01:18:47,717 --> 01:18:49,548
- Okay.
- Okay.

850
01:20:27,984 --> 01:20:29,474
Don't kill me.

851
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:32,351
I'm sorry.

852
01:20:33,723 --> 01:20:35,088
I'm sorry.

853
01:20:36,826 --> 01:20:40,353
Musgrave told us about Julia.
We're here to help.

854
01:20:40,496 --> 01:20:42,589
To get your wife,
you'll need the Rabbit's Foot.

855
01:20:42,698 --> 01:20:44,723
According to the plans
from Davian's briefcase,

856
01:20:44,834 --> 01:20:48,292
it's in a laboratory on the 56th floor
of the Hengshan Lu Building.

857
01:20:48,404 --> 01:20:50,269
Which is a nightmare
for just about every reason.

858
01:20:50,373 --> 01:20:54,002
They're a Chinese military contractor.
We have no pull, no details.

859
01:20:54,143 --> 01:20:55,940
The good news is, whatever it is,

860
01:20:56,045 --> 01:20:58,309
the Rabbit Foot's small,
so we can steal it.

861
01:20:58,414 --> 01:21:01,110
The bad news, we got to steal it.

862
01:21:01,984 --> 01:21:04,646
From a thief's point of view,
this is worst-case scenario.

863
01:21:04,754 --> 01:21:06,949
The security guards
are all privately-contracted

864
01:21:07,056 --> 01:21:08,421
former People's Liberation Army.

865
01:21:08,524 --> 01:21:10,788
The only access to the lab
is by private elevator.

866
01:21:10,893 --> 01:21:13,555
And that can only be activated
by persons inside the lab.

867
01:21:13,663 --> 01:21:16,496
All of it surveilled by
security cameras within the building.

868
01:21:16,599 --> 01:21:18,464
What about the roof?

869
01:21:19,402 --> 01:21:22,166
Four guards full time.
Two on each rooftop.

870
01:21:22,271 --> 01:21:24,068
Langley was a cakewalk
compared to this.

871
01:21:24,173 --> 01:21:25,697
That's the one.

872
01:21:26,609 --> 01:21:28,577
- How tall is that building?
- Why?

873
01:21:28,678 --> 01:21:30,976
It's 162 meters at the highest point.

874
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:33,514
What about that, the building
on the left? How tall is that one?

875
01:21:33,616 --> 01:21:35,083
Says 226 meters.

876
01:21:35,218 --> 01:21:37,846
226. Distance between the buildings?

877
01:21:37,954 --> 01:21:39,751
47.55 meters across.

878
01:21:56,405 --> 01:21:57,565
Ethan?

879
01:21:58,307 --> 01:22:01,071
That's good. I think it's tall enough.

880
01:22:02,278 --> 01:22:04,712
- For what?
- A fulcrum.

881
01:22:06,816 --> 01:22:09,512
Oh, you're gonna swing...
No, no, no, no. Wait, wait.

882
01:22:09,619 --> 01:22:12,019
- You could bounce right off the roof.
- Yes, I could.

883
01:22:12,121 --> 01:22:14,248
Even if you made it to the rooftop,
took out the guards,

884
01:22:14,357 --> 01:22:17,986
and got the Rabbit's Foot, you can't just
walk out of the lobby. What's your exit?

885
01:22:18,094 --> 01:22:19,721
Base-jump off the top. I need a chute.

886
01:22:19,829 --> 01:22:22,024
Even at 162, you're pushing
minimum height for a jump.

887
01:22:22,131 --> 01:22:23,689
Chute opens any lower than that
and you're dead.

888
01:22:23,799 --> 01:22:24,857
What are you going to do?

889
01:22:24,967 --> 01:22:27,060
Land in the middle of Shanghai
and hope no one notices?

890
01:22:27,169 --> 01:22:28,431
Central Park's two blocks away.

891
01:22:28,537 --> 01:22:30,437
Wait, wait, Ethan, I'm not saying
I have a better idea,

892
01:22:30,539 --> 01:22:33,007
but there's a point
where bold becomes stupid.

893
01:22:33,109 --> 01:22:35,577
Now, we don't even know
what this thing is, and you're talking

894
01:22:35,678 --> 01:22:38,545
about handing it over to a guy
who provides terrorists with information.

895
01:22:38,648 --> 01:22:40,741
Luther, of course I'm not
suggesting that we just hand it over.

896
01:22:40,850 --> 01:22:43,717
We're going to tag the Rabbit's Foot
so we can trace it and know where it is.

897
01:22:43,819 --> 01:22:46,720
Now, you know we can get
that gear here. I just deliver it myself.

898
01:22:46,822 --> 01:22:49,689
We contact Musgrave,
have the IMF trace a tag, order a raid,

899
01:22:49,792 --> 01:22:51,555
get the Rabbit's Foot back, grab Davian.

900
01:22:51,661 --> 01:22:54,357
Now, if I get out with Julia, we win.

901
01:22:55,498 --> 01:22:57,261
If I don't, then...

902
01:23:03,673 --> 01:23:06,540
Look, then she's dead anyway.
And so am I.

903
01:23:07,743 --> 01:23:09,040
You know?

904
01:23:09,178 --> 01:23:13,512
Goddamn it, it's 8:11, it's 8:12.

905
01:23:16,018 --> 01:23:19,146
And we have two hours
before they kill my wife.

906
01:23:20,056 --> 01:23:21,785
Are you in or not?

907
01:23:29,365 --> 01:23:31,060
Of course we're in.

908
01:24:03,399 --> 01:24:05,162
You got 18 minutes.

909
01:24:07,570 --> 01:24:09,470
You're going to make it over there.

910
01:24:09,572 --> 01:24:12,905
You're going to find the Rabbit's Foot,
get back to the roof,

911
01:24:13,042 --> 01:24:14,839
radio me when you're ready to make
the jump,

912
01:24:14,944 --> 01:24:17,378
and we're going to come get you.

913
01:24:18,381 --> 01:24:20,110
Thank you for coming.

914
01:24:20,883 --> 01:24:22,350
That's my job.

915
01:24:58,654 --> 01:24:59,985
Batter up.

916
01:25:27,783 --> 01:25:30,809
Oh, yeah. They're freaking out.
Hit them again.

917
01:27:05,714 --> 01:27:06,840
Okay.

918
01:27:08,384 --> 01:27:09,373
<i>He made it.</i>

919
01:27:09,585 --> 01:27:10,950
He made it.

920
01:27:14,089 --> 01:27:15,852
I knew he'd make it.

921
01:27:30,406 --> 01:27:33,307
I'm going in. I'll be out in five minutes.

922
01:27:41,483 --> 01:27:43,883
- It's been 12 minutes.
- He's got five minutes left.

923
01:27:43,986 --> 01:27:47,422
If he doesn't call Davian in five minutes,
Julia's dead.

924
01:27:47,523 --> 01:27:48,888
<i>Anything?</i>

925
01:27:50,459 --> 01:27:51,448
Negative.

926
01:27:51,594 --> 01:27:53,721
<i>How about you? Any good news?</i>

927
01:27:53,829 --> 01:27:55,262
No, nothing.

928
01:27:55,431 --> 01:27:56,921
Come on, Ethan.

929
01:28:06,208 --> 01:28:07,675
What is that?

930
01:28:12,848 --> 01:28:17,148
When I was little I had a cat,
and he used to run away all the time.

931
01:28:18,654 --> 01:28:21,782
And it's just a prayer I'd say
to bring him home.

932
01:28:23,726 --> 01:28:25,250
Teach it to me.

933
01:28:27,029 --> 01:28:29,224
<i>I've got the Rabbit's Foot,
but I can't make it to the roof.</i>

934
01:28:29,331 --> 01:28:32,129
What the hell do you mean you can't
make it to the roof? Where are you?

935
01:28:32,234 --> 01:28:34,293
<i>Look up! Look up, look up!</i>

936
01:28:37,172 --> 01:28:39,333
- Oh, shit.
- He's way too low.

937
01:30:30,119 --> 01:30:33,111
- Ethan! Get in! They're coming!
- Who?

938
01:30:33,255 --> 01:30:35,883
Building security, and they're pissed.

939
01:30:38,494 --> 01:30:40,325
Okay. Go, go, go, go.

940
01:30:47,202 --> 01:30:49,295
How much time you got left?

941
01:30:49,605 --> 01:30:51,402
Less than two minutes.

942
01:30:57,713 --> 01:31:00,841
You gotta get us out of here.
I lost the signal.

943
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:05,315
- You okay?
- Not yet.

944
01:31:13,695 --> 01:31:14,821
Come on. Come on.

945
01:31:22,237 --> 01:31:23,864
I don't have a signal.
I don't have a signal.

946
01:31:23,972 --> 01:31:25,166
I'm on it. I'm on it. I'm on it!

947
01:31:33,649 --> 01:31:34,707
Zhen!

948
01:31:36,852 --> 01:31:38,479
Damn it. I'm sorry.

949
01:31:46,728 --> 01:31:48,389
Put pressure on it.

950
01:31:48,897 --> 01:31:52,025
- Tell me when you get a signal.
- What are you doing?

951
01:32:11,119 --> 01:32:12,677
I got a signal!

952
01:32:17,025 --> 01:32:18,322
Hit redial.

953
01:32:20,462 --> 01:32:23,158
<i>You only had five seconds left.
Do you realize that?</i>

954
01:32:23,265 --> 01:32:25,563
The Rabbit's Foot. I have it.

955
01:32:25,934 --> 01:32:29,927
<i>The train yard at Dunan Zhong Lu.
Wait for me there. Alone.</i>

956
01:32:33,242 --> 01:32:34,709
<i>- Yeah?
- Go secure.</i>

957
01:32:34,810 --> 01:32:36,038
We are.

958
01:32:37,145 --> 01:32:39,170
<i>I have the Rabbit's Foot.</i>

959
01:32:39,281 --> 01:32:41,511
- You okay?
- I'm tagging it now.

960
01:32:44,486 --> 01:32:46,852
You need to run a trace.
Make sure we have eyes on this thing.

961
01:32:46,955 --> 01:32:49,924
- What's the tag?
- 6-3-9-6-4-1.

962
01:32:50,893 --> 01:32:52,053
Got it.

963
01:32:54,796 --> 01:32:56,127
I see you on Luang Tao Lu Road.

964
01:32:56,231 --> 01:32:59,723
If you don't hear from me in eight hours,
you send an army after this thing.

965
01:32:59,835 --> 01:33:01,700
- Good luck.
- You, too.

966
01:33:09,111 --> 01:33:10,908
<i>- Mr. Musgrave.
- Yeah.</i>

967
01:33:11,146 --> 01:33:13,205
<i>It's come to my attention
that yesterday afternoon</i>

968
01:33:13,315 --> 01:33:14,805
<i>you sent a team to the Far East.</i>

969
01:33:15,450 --> 01:33:17,509
We received intel that
Hadaam Saleen Bahar

970
01:33:17,619 --> 01:33:18,881
was en route to Shanghai.

971
01:33:18,987 --> 01:33:21,285
- Hadaam Saleen Bahar.
- That's right.

972
01:33:21,423 --> 01:33:23,357
You know what I'd love?
I'd love to see that intel.

973
01:33:23,458 --> 01:33:25,928
- I'll be in my office.
- Yes, sir.

974
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:39,930
Thanks again.

975
01:33:40,342 --> 01:33:42,310
I'll see you back home.

976
01:33:43,211 --> 01:33:44,439
Ethan.

977
01:33:45,647 --> 01:33:48,616
You know they probably plan
to kill you both.

978
01:33:50,319 --> 01:33:52,617
Then I won't see you back home.

979
01:33:54,189 --> 01:33:55,747
Better get back.

980
01:34:42,738 --> 01:34:45,138
Drink it. No questions.

981
01:35:48,737 --> 01:35:50,102
Good morning.

982
01:36:06,021 --> 01:36:07,147
Jules.

983
01:36:08,356 --> 01:36:11,223
We've put an explosive charge
in your head.

984
01:36:11,326 --> 01:36:13,385
Does that sound familiar?

985
01:36:14,129 --> 01:36:16,427
The Rabbit's Foot. Where is it?

986
01:36:17,165 --> 01:36:18,826
I gave it to you.

987
01:36:19,434 --> 01:36:21,629
Now, I'm going to count to 10

988
01:36:21,770 --> 01:36:25,399
and you're going to tell me
where the Rabbit's Foot is

989
01:36:26,808 --> 01:36:28,173
or she dies.

990
01:36:53,368 --> 01:36:56,701
Seems we have a lot to talk about.
Don't we?

991
01:36:59,541 --> 01:37:01,475
- Do you think I'm playing?
- Son of a bitch!

992
01:37:01,576 --> 01:37:04,306
Do you think I'm playing?
You don't think I'll do it?

993
01:37:04,412 --> 01:37:05,470
Where is it?

994
01:37:05,580 --> 01:37:06,945
- Look at me.
- Where the hell is it?

995
01:37:07,048 --> 01:37:08,310
- Look at me. Stay with me.
- Seven!

996
01:37:08,416 --> 01:37:10,646
I am going to kill you.
I swear to God I'm going to...

997
01:37:10,752 --> 01:37:12,617
- Eight!
- No, please.

998
01:37:14,422 --> 01:37:17,949
Please. Don't do this. Just let her go.

999
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:21,552
I promise you. I promise you.

1000
01:37:21,930 --> 01:37:24,626
- I can figure out how to get whatever...
- Nine.

1001
01:37:25,667 --> 01:37:28,602
Listen to me. I want to help you get
whatever you want.

1002
01:37:28,703 --> 01:37:32,230
But you got to do what's right.
What you know is right.

1003
01:37:33,175 --> 01:37:34,642
No, please...

1004
01:37:37,279 --> 01:37:38,337
No.

1005
01:37:40,582 --> 01:37:41,571
No.

1006
01:37:41,950 --> 01:37:43,679
- Ten.
- Don't!

1007
01:38:00,535 --> 01:38:04,164
I pushed him as far as he can go.
I know he's not lying.

1008
01:38:04,472 --> 01:38:05,996
I understand.

1009
01:38:06,608 --> 01:38:09,771
I've got some questions
I want to ask him first.

1010
01:38:32,234 --> 01:38:33,861
It's complicated.

1011
01:38:40,775 --> 01:38:42,970
You can't just open the canister.

1012
01:38:43,111 --> 01:38:45,944
We had to make sure
you brought the real thing.

1013
01:38:46,081 --> 01:38:49,380
The Rabbit's Foot. Now we know.

1014
01:38:58,159 --> 01:39:01,390
Don't you touch her!
Don't you touch her!

1015
01:39:10,639 --> 01:39:14,075
Davian's translator,
his Head of Security.

1016
01:39:15,377 --> 01:39:18,505
Remember?
At the Vatican she failed him.

1017
01:39:20,882 --> 01:39:25,080
Ethan, Julia is still alive.

1018
01:39:25,887 --> 01:39:29,755
Davian wanted to kill you both,
but I convinced him otherwise.

1019
01:39:29,858 --> 01:39:33,692
Julia hasn't seen me.
She doesn't know anything. She's clean.

1020
01:39:33,862 --> 01:39:36,160
She can go on to have a life.

1021
01:39:36,564 --> 01:39:41,126
As long as you tell me,
what was in Lindsey's message?

1022
01:39:42,137 --> 01:39:44,970
I know she sent you a microdot
from Berlin.

1023
01:39:46,374 --> 01:39:48,842
Did Lindsey know
about me and Davian?

1024
01:39:48,977 --> 01:39:51,912
Is that why she sent the message
to you? Did you read it?

1025
01:39:52,013 --> 01:39:53,640
Did anyone else see it?

1026
01:39:53,748 --> 01:39:56,046
Did she know about the work
I was doing?

1027
01:39:56,151 --> 01:39:58,119
Could I be compromised at IMF?

1028
01:39:58,219 --> 01:39:59,846
Ethan. Ethan.

1029
01:40:01,323 --> 01:40:03,655
Did she buy that Brassel set her up?

1030
01:40:03,758 --> 01:40:05,487
Did she buy that?

1031
01:40:06,761 --> 01:40:08,194
You told him.

1032
01:40:09,564 --> 01:40:12,032
That's how Davian knew
Lindsey was coming.

1033
01:40:12,167 --> 01:40:13,725
You told him.

1034
01:40:15,704 --> 01:40:17,968
I thought you could get her back.

1035
01:40:18,073 --> 01:40:21,668
But I wasn't gonna let Brassel,
of all people, undo the work I'd done.

1036
01:40:21,776 --> 01:40:26,213
I took action, Ethan, on behalf
of the working families of our country.

1037
01:40:26,348 --> 01:40:27,747
The Armed Forces, the White House.

1038
01:40:27,849 --> 01:40:29,783
I'd had enough
of Brassel and his sanctimony.

1039
01:40:29,884 --> 01:40:33,183
IMF Executive Director.
He's an affirmative action poster boy.

1040
01:40:33,288 --> 01:40:36,746
You grab Davian like he wanted,
then what?

1041
01:40:37,359 --> 01:40:38,986
Davian's a weed.

1042
01:40:40,695 --> 01:40:44,722
You cut him out, two more spring up
just like him the next day.

1043
01:40:44,933 --> 01:40:46,833
Arrest him? Then what?

1044
01:40:48,269 --> 01:40:49,668
You use him.

1045
01:40:51,139 --> 01:40:53,767
Collaborate with him.

1046
01:40:55,276 --> 01:40:57,267
And it's Christmas.

1047
01:40:59,114 --> 01:41:02,049
In 18 hours,
the Rabbit's Foot will be delivered

1048
01:41:02,150 --> 01:41:05,449
to its Middle Eastern buyer,
and we'll have credible intel to prove it.

1049
01:41:05,553 --> 01:41:08,386
US Security Council will get a report
by this time tomorrow.

1050
01:41:08,490 --> 01:41:11,550
We're talking a military strike
within a week.

1051
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:14,019
And when the sand settles,

1052
01:41:14,496 --> 01:41:16,964
our country will do what it does best.

1053
01:41:17,098 --> 01:41:19,760
Clean up. Infrastructure.

1054
01:41:21,503 --> 01:41:23,095
Democracy wins.

1055
01:41:27,475 --> 01:41:30,308
What was Lindsey's message?

1056
01:41:31,346 --> 01:41:34,645
You tell me, and Julia walks.

1057
01:41:37,252 --> 01:41:39,720
It's the only play you have left.

1058
01:41:41,089 --> 01:41:44,456
Not till I hear her voice,
know she's alive.

1059
01:41:46,628 --> 01:41:47,925
Of course.

1060
01:42:01,042 --> 01:42:02,407
Put her on.

1061
01:42:10,018 --> 01:42:11,080
<i>- Jules?
- Ethan?</i>

1062
01:42:11,115 --> 01:42:12,142
<i>- Jules?
- Ethan?</i>

1063
01:42:12,454 --> 01:42:15,685
When we met,
there was a lake near the mountain.

1064
01:42:17,892 --> 01:42:19,860
What was the lake called?

1065
01:42:21,196 --> 01:42:22,424
<i>Wanaka.</i>

1066
01:42:23,031 --> 01:42:24,589
<i>Please, Ethan.</i>

1067
01:42:24,799 --> 01:42:27,324
<i>- Jules.
- Ethan, I don't understand...</i>

1068
01:42:46,721 --> 01:42:48,211
Benjamin Dunne.

1069
01:42:48,990 --> 01:42:50,048
Benji, it's me.

1070
01:42:50,158 --> 01:42:53,184
<i>- Ethan.
- What? No. Really?</i>

1071
01:42:53,328 --> 01:42:54,989
<i>Listen to me very carefully.
I need your help.</i>

1072
01:42:56,698 --> 01:42:59,929
I need to trace the location
of the last call made from this phone.

1073
01:43:00,034 --> 01:43:01,661
Look, no. Ethan. Shush.

1074
01:43:01,769 --> 01:43:03,498
<i>They're looking...
Everyone's looking for you.</i>

1075
01:43:03,605 --> 01:43:06,665
<i>Everyone I know. They're looking...
I just looked it up.</i>

1076
01:43:06,774 --> 01:43:08,605
<i>Okay, you're on
Interpol's most wanted list.</i>

1077
01:43:08,710 --> 01:43:11,178
And that, by the way,
is a spectacular list to be on.

1078
01:43:11,279 --> 01:43:13,747
<i>Whatever happened, I'm sorry,
but I'm hanging up now right now.</i>

1079
01:43:13,848 --> 01:43:15,076
Benji, I don't have time for this.

1080
01:43:15,183 --> 01:43:16,810
What do you think happened?
I've been set up.

1081
01:43:16,918 --> 01:43:19,978
I think I like my job. Okay? A lot.

1082
01:43:20,088 --> 01:43:21,919
All right? And you know
they're gonna be taping this call.

1083
01:43:22,257 --> 01:43:24,987
And you know you can erase it.
I'm giving you the number right now.

1084
01:43:25,093 --> 01:43:27,186
- Are you ready?
- All right. Just hang on.

1085
01:43:27,295 --> 01:43:29,661
I'm gonna lose my citizenship
because of this, you know.

1086
01:43:29,764 --> 01:43:32,597
7-3-4-4-2-5-6-4-3-6-7.

1087
01:43:32,734 --> 01:43:35,498
Okay. Wait. Okay. Hold the line, please.

1088
01:43:49,817 --> 01:43:51,409
- Are you there?
- Yeah.

1089
01:43:51,553 --> 01:43:52,747
<i>Okay.</i>

1090
01:43:53,454 --> 01:43:56,582
<i>Maybe we can share a jail cell together,
you know?</i>

1091
01:43:56,724 --> 01:43:59,249
If this all goes tits up, which it will.

1092
01:43:59,394 --> 01:44:01,191
The location of that number
is Shanghai.

1093
01:44:01,296 --> 01:44:02,558
There, I just told you. Shanghai.

1094
01:44:02,664 --> 01:44:05,292
I've just aided and abetted an enemy
of the state. Fantastic. Thank you.

1095
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:07,698
Am I close?
Use this phone to track my location.

1096
01:44:07,802 --> 01:44:10,202
Oh, you're there. Well, you're close.

1097
01:44:10,305 --> 01:44:12,068
How close?
Is the signal in the building?

1098
01:44:12,173 --> 01:44:13,640
No, no, no. It isn't coming from there.

1099
01:44:13,741 --> 01:44:15,538
It's in a building
one mile to the northeast.

1100
01:44:15,643 --> 01:44:17,235
<i>Benji, lead me to the signal.</i>

1101
01:44:29,791 --> 01:44:33,283
<i>There is one thing. What the hell
are you doing in Shanghai?</i>

1102
01:44:33,428 --> 01:44:35,589
I'll tell you when I see you.

1103
01:44:44,138 --> 01:44:46,402
What you...
You need to go north.

1104
01:44:46,507 --> 01:44:48,873
Okay, there's a bridge.
Get to it, cross it.

1105
01:44:48,977 --> 01:44:52,310
<i>Make a left. Go three-quarters of a mile
along the river.</i>

1106
01:44:52,447 --> 01:44:54,244
I got it. I got it.

1107
01:45:29,651 --> 01:45:31,585
Good, good. That's right.
Keep going. Keep going.

1108
01:45:31,686 --> 01:45:33,085
Make your next left
and then the next one.

1109
01:45:33,187 --> 01:45:34,779
And then follow that down 1,000 yards.

1110
01:45:34,889 --> 01:45:36,550
A thousand yards.

1111
01:45:36,924 --> 01:45:39,825
<i>- Okay. Okay, okay.
- Okay, okay. Left. Left.</i>

1112
01:45:40,395 --> 01:45:42,488
Yeah, that's good. That's good.
Keep going. Keep going.

1113
01:45:42,597 --> 01:45:44,724
Okay, now look... Hiya. Hi.

1114
01:45:44,866 --> 01:45:46,333
<i>Benji, where?</i>

1115
01:45:46,434 --> 01:45:48,698
<i>- Benji? Which way do I go?
- Now take a right.</i>

1116
01:45:55,443 --> 01:45:56,910
Okay. Go down, left.

1117
01:45:57,345 --> 01:45:59,176
Left? I'm going left.

1118
01:46:01,082 --> 01:46:02,174
<i>Good, good.</i>

1119
01:46:02,283 --> 01:46:04,012
It's in the second building on your left.

1120
01:46:04,118 --> 01:46:06,484
The signal bearing's
plus or minus three meters

1121
01:46:06,587 --> 01:46:07,713
from the northeast corner.

1122
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:09,518
I owe you.

1123
01:48:06,808 --> 01:48:08,708
Jules. Jules.

1124
01:48:09,377 --> 01:48:11,004
You're gonna be okay.

1125
01:48:14,048 --> 01:48:15,310
Oh, God!

1126
01:48:15,850 --> 01:48:16,874
God!

1127
01:48:27,562 --> 01:48:29,996
I've activated the charge in your head.

1128
01:48:35,503 --> 01:48:37,971
You have maybe four minutes left.

1129
01:48:47,448 --> 01:48:50,144
Didn't I tell you
she'd call out your name?

1130
01:48:56,257 --> 01:48:59,226
Ethan. Ethan.

1131
01:49:03,364 --> 01:49:04,422
No.

1132
01:49:09,303 --> 01:49:10,600
Please.

1133
01:49:15,443 --> 01:49:18,776
And I told you I was going to kill you
in front of her?

1134
01:49:18,913 --> 01:49:21,438
Well, I'm going to kill her in front of you.

1135
01:51:13,995 --> 01:51:15,121
Ethan?

1136
01:51:18,432 --> 01:51:19,899
Are you okay?

1137
01:51:21,002 --> 01:51:22,731
I don't understand
what's going on, Ethan.

1138
01:51:22,837 --> 01:51:25,772
- I know. I know. Just wait.
- What do those men want from you?

1139
01:51:25,873 --> 01:51:28,501
Why are we here?
How did you find me?

1140
01:51:29,610 --> 01:51:32,408
Please, Ethan.
What the hell is going on?

1141
01:51:32,580 --> 01:51:33,877
Are you okay?

1142
01:51:34,015 --> 01:51:37,712
Ethan, what's wrong? Okay. Oh, God.

1143
01:51:40,855 --> 01:51:44,723
I'm going to tell you everything.
You just stay with me.

1144
01:51:51,365 --> 01:51:54,266
Ethan. What's happening?
What are you looking for?

1145
01:51:54,402 --> 01:51:57,098
- We've got to get out of here.
- Not yet.

1146
01:51:58,906 --> 01:52:00,601
- They don't have one!
- What?

1147
01:52:00,708 --> 01:52:03,108
- A defibrillator.
- A defibrillator?

1148
01:52:03,244 --> 01:52:04,336
Ethan?

1149
01:52:05,112 --> 01:52:09,048
Ethan? Who are these people?
What the hell are we doing here?

1150
01:52:11,952 --> 01:52:13,180
Good!

1151
01:52:14,622 --> 01:52:16,715
This is a Beretta 92F.

1152
01:52:17,558 --> 01:52:19,355
It's a very accurate,
close-range weapon.

1153
01:52:19,460 --> 01:52:21,690
- Don't point it at me.
- Sorry.

1154
01:52:23,664 --> 01:52:25,063
It holds 15 rounds.

1155
01:52:25,166 --> 01:52:28,533
When the mag is empty,
the slide will lock back like this.

1156
01:52:28,636 --> 01:52:30,866
How do you know so much about this?

1157
01:52:30,971 --> 01:52:33,565
To reload, push this button.

1158
01:52:34,008 --> 01:52:35,566
The empty mag falls out

1159
01:52:35,676 --> 01:52:37,610
and you shove the other one in,

1160
01:52:37,745 --> 01:52:40,213
like the batteries in the flashlight
in the kitchen,

1161
01:52:40,314 --> 01:52:42,248
then release the slide.

1162
01:52:45,453 --> 01:52:47,478
- Why are you giving me a gun?
- There could be others.

1163
01:52:47,588 --> 01:52:49,351
If you have to use it, you stay low.

1164
01:52:49,457 --> 01:52:52,153
You identify your enemy.
Point and shoot.

1165
01:52:52,293 --> 01:52:53,851
It's very simple. Point and shoot.

1166
01:52:53,961 --> 01:52:55,326
Stand back.

1167
01:52:57,098 --> 01:52:58,156
Good.

1168
01:52:59,500 --> 01:53:02,230
I have a charge in my head.
I'm going to die unless you kill me.

1169
01:53:02,336 --> 01:53:04,327
- What?
- Throw the switch on and off.

1170
01:53:04,438 --> 01:53:05,871
- Don't forget the off.
- I can't do that.

1171
01:53:05,973 --> 01:53:08,203
You can bring me back.
I'll come back.

1172
01:53:08,309 --> 01:53:10,539
- I can't.
- You have to! There's no time!

1173
01:53:10,644 --> 01:53:12,111
Now! Please!

1174
01:53:18,986 --> 01:53:21,511
Wait, wait! Wait. Wait. I love you.

1175
01:53:21,822 --> 01:53:23,153
I love you.

1176
01:54:38,299 --> 01:54:39,527
Oh, God.

1177
01:54:45,706 --> 01:54:47,173
Come on, baby.

1178
01:54:51,545 --> 01:54:54,946
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight,

1179
01:54:55,082 --> 01:54:58,677
nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen,
fourteen, fifteen.

1180
01:55:03,791 --> 01:55:08,285
Come on, baby.
I need you to come back.

1181
01:55:09,730 --> 01:55:11,288
I need you back.

1182
01:55:57,544 --> 01:55:58,841
Oh, God.

1183
01:56:08,122 --> 01:56:09,521
You did that?

1184
01:56:13,394 --> 01:56:14,486
Wow.

1185
01:56:41,388 --> 01:56:43,481
So, I was just thinking...

1186
01:56:45,926 --> 01:56:49,862
I was thinking you might want to tell me
why we're in China.

1187
01:56:51,398 --> 01:56:52,626
I know.

1188
01:56:56,737 --> 01:56:57,795
I...

1189
01:56:59,606 --> 01:57:01,471
I work for an agency.

1190
01:57:02,543 --> 01:57:04,135
It's called IMF.

1191
01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:08,848
What does that stand for?

1192
01:57:10,084 --> 01:57:12,143
Impossible Mission Force.

1193
01:57:13,120 --> 01:57:14,314
Shut up.

1194
01:57:15,222 --> 01:57:16,587
No, I'm not kidding.

1195
01:57:16,690 --> 01:57:20,558
You don't understand.
Everything I'm telling you is top-secret.

1196
01:57:20,694 --> 01:57:22,389
You can trust me.

1197
01:57:22,896 --> 01:57:24,158
Yeah, I know.

1198
01:57:25,566 --> 01:57:28,126
<i>Just wanna show my appreciation
for your work.</i>

1199
01:57:35,609 --> 01:57:39,511
Call it reparations for anything
I might have put you through.

1200
01:57:39,913 --> 01:57:42,006
You should know
the White House has contacted me.

1201
01:57:42,116 --> 01:57:44,448
Now, there's a job that they are

1202
01:57:45,119 --> 01:57:47,713
very interested
in speaking with you about.

1203
01:57:51,158 --> 01:57:53,592
Thank you,

1204
01:57:54,661 --> 01:57:55,821
but I have a lot to think about.

1205
01:57:55,929 --> 01:57:58,955
You aren't considering quitting,
are you, Ethan?

1206
01:57:59,099 --> 01:58:01,693
I'm considering
going on my honeymoon.

1207
01:58:04,671 --> 01:58:05,831
- Have fun.
- Thank you.

1208
01:58:05,939 --> 01:58:07,031
Yeah.

1209
01:58:08,842 --> 01:58:10,400
Hey, one thing.

1210
01:58:11,979 --> 01:58:14,243
The Rabbit's Foot. What is it?

1211
01:58:17,684 --> 01:58:20,482
Promise me you'll stay, I'll tell you.

1212
01:58:23,123 --> 01:58:25,921
- I'll send you a postcard.
- Fair enough.

1213
01:59:10,522 --> 02:05:22,000
