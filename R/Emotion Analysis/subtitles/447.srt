00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,166
Hello? This is
Sandy Patterson.

2
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,446
<i>Yes, Mr. Patterson.</i>

3
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,041
<i>I'm Janine from the
Fraud Protection Department</i>

4
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,088
<i>of Identi-vault
Credit Monitoring Service.</i>

5
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,083
<i>We're calling today
because, unfortunately,</i>

6
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,528
<i>it appears that someone has
attempted to steal your identity.</i>

7
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,641
Are you kidding me?

8
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,446
<i>Gosh, I wish I were. We did
catch this in time, however.</i>

9
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,727
<i>But I do suggest
you taking advantage</i>

10
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,007
<i>of our free total
protection plan,</i>

11
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,921
<i>which safeguards your credit
rating against theft and fraud.</i>

12
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,890
Yes, please.
If it's free, absolutely.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,810
<i>Just terrific.
I went for this plan myself.</i>

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,570
<i>Mr. Patterson,
I'm gonna need to</i>

15
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,210
<i>verify some
information from you.</i>

16
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,364
I'm gonna need your
full name, date of birth,

17
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,126
and Social Security
number, please.

18
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,884
<i>Sure, understood.
Here it comes.</i>

19
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,407
What can I get for you?

20
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,641
I'm gonna have a melon ball.

21
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,842
And some tequila.
And let's start a tab.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,729
You got it.

23
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,006
And keep it open.

24
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,330
My friends can't make it.

25
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,525
Here I am, stuck with all these
premium tequila shots, so...

26
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,728
That's what we're drinking.

27
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,041
No.

28
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,287
My name's Sandy.

29
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,407
Hi, Sandy.

30
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,369
Okay. Cheers.

31
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,681
Mmm!

32
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,686
Let's get another round.

33
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,765
Chug! Chug! Chug!

34
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,129
Another round on me!

35
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,730
Sandy! Sandy! Sandy!

36
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,887
Who the hell is she?

37
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,610
Who cares?
She's buying free drinks.

38
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,281
Let's go!

39
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,247
When I say "Sandy,"
you say "Patterson."

40
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,289
- Sandy!
- Patterson!

41
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,089
Sandy!
Patterson!

42
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,924
Who wants another drink?

43
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,764
We do!

44
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,970
Enough. No more.

45
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,724
Ma'am, get down.

46
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,327
Who here wants to see me
swing on that chandelier?

47
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,928
No, no, no.
You can't be up there.

48
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,441
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

49
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,002
Uh, yeah, yeah, you can hear me,
because you're answering me.

50
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,481
Whoa, I didn't hear that either.

51
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,724
Here we go, bitches!

52
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,763
Ma'am, you've gotta get down.

53
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,241
Oh, shit.

54
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,005
Whoo-hoo!

55
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,290
Sandy! Sandy! Sandy!

56
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,807
It's over.
Shaw's over, okay?

57
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,486
You, you're out of here.
You're done, come on.

58
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,449
No. You're out of here.

59
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,047
Go back behind the bar and start
making more drinks for my friends.

60
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,487
These aren't
your friends, okay?

61
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,450
They like you because
you're buying them drinks.

62
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,602
People like you
don't have friends.

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,527
I think we're really hitting it off.
Don't you?

64
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,681
Sandy Patterson.

65
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,086
That's me.

66
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,084
You're under arrest for assault
and public intoxication.

67
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,844
I don't think that's accurate.

68
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,571
Blow into this.

69
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,165
Oh, my pleasure.

70
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,681
How did I do?

71
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,569
Huh. Look at that.

72
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,927
Happy birthday,
Sandy Patterson.

73
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,686
Shit.

74
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,243
All right, cheese!
There it is.

75
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,810
Happy birthday,
Sandy Patterson.

76
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,001
Happy birthday, Daddy.

77
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,440
Thank you.
Thank you all for coming.

78
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,082
Make a wish.
Here we go.

79
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,681
Bravo!

80
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,603
That's great. One lungful.

81
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,886
I made you this, Daddy.

82
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,008
Thank you. Look at that.

83
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,366
Did you see that, Mommy?
I did.

84
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,881
Looks very expensive.
Did you steal it?

85
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,680
This looks very expensive.

86
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,326
Little thief! You know what
happens to thieves? Huh?

87
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,290
Let me tell you what happens to a thief.
This is your punishment.

88
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,442
Be careful!
Just the face!

89
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,604
There it is. That's what you get!

90
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,685
Do you see?
Don't steal things.

91
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,167
All right, let's get a knife,
I want to start on this.

92
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,921
Come on, not on your birthday.

93
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,324
After rent, utilities, gas and
phone, we saved a little this month.

94
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,527
Ooh! How much?

95
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,926
<i>$14.03.</i>

96
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,685
Half of that's mine, you know.

97
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,164
You're welcome.
Invest it wisely.

98
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,402
What about your bonus?

99
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,449
They got canceled again.

100
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,480
It's the financial industry, I can't
exactly argue things are going well.

101
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,763
You're gonna get promoted.
Mmm-hmm.

102
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,841
You're going to.
It's fine, we're fine.

103
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,565
I know.
We are pregnant, though.

104
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,449
I'm pregnant.

105
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,362
Look at me. We're fine.

106
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,683
Until braces and
college and weddings.

107
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,327
Maybe this one's a boy
and we can send him to work.

108
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,528
Like, in a mine.

109
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,170
Yeah. It's a reasonable plan.

110
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,807
Oh!

111
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,009
I have one more present
for you to unwrap.

112
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,327
Oh!

113
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,122
Why don't we... Let's go, let's go.
Let's go to a room.

114
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,881
I rented a room in the back.

115
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,250
Patterson.
Hi, good morning.

116
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,521
Good morning.

117
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,682
Hey. Did I ask you to pay for
the Westfield sweep account

118
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,767
under the holding corp?

119
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,841
Yeah.

120
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,921
Shit. It was supposed to...

121
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,490
Supposed to be
under the subsidiary,

122
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,971
so you could roll over
the qualified plan.

123
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,565
I did it both ways.
I had a feeling.

124
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,404
I knew you would.

125
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,607
I'll e-mail it to you.

126
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,761
You're the best, Patterson.

127
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,921
Sandy.
Yeah?

128
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,884
Cornish wants you
in his office.

129
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,568
Hey, cheese dick.
Cheese dick? Me?

130
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,647
I wanna talk to you.

131
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,807
You got a minute?
Yeah, sorry.

132
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,291
What have you been up to?

133
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,885
Oh, I just got here, actually.
Just starting...

134
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,724
I got the thing.
Oh, you got the thing.

135
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,406
Uh-huh. Well, we could go...

136
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,809
Okay, well, we'll meet then.

137
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,971
I'm gonna need you
to do something for me.

138
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,041
That one mine?
Yeah, you.

139
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,121
Anything.
She said come on in.

140
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,201
All right, good.

141
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,641
Was that...
Yes.

142
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,531
You're not gonna. Good. All
right, thank you. You, too.

143
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,090
You process all the
in-house accounts, right?

144
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,207
I do.

145
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,568
I need you to cut some
bonus checks for me.

146
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,562
Bonus checks!
We have not...

147
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,846
Oh, that's great.

148
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,285
We have not had
them for three years,

149
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,566
I heard we weren't
getting them again.

150
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,005
Yeah, it's not a
company-wide bonus, though.

151
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,407
It's only on the partner level.
It's for retention.

152
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,481
Not for us.

153
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,846
The checks are being
cut to the people

154
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,160
on that list,
who are all partners,

155
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,925
but the retention program is to
keep the entire company healthy.

156
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,891
But there's
no money going to...

157
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,089
We survived a terrible,
terrible moment in our history,

158
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,766
and we retained
60% of the workforce.

159
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,841
Lost 40, though.

160
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,160
Those are pretty
impressive numbers,

161
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,720
so I think everybody
should be happy about this.

162
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,926
Well, this is great news.

163
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,680
I don't understand the tone of your voice.
You're acting like it's a...

164
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,171
No, I was just so excited

165
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,566
because we haven't had the
bonuses for three years.

166
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,688
The company's doing well, I
thought maybe this was the day.

167
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,600
Okay. Just because Harry
Cornish gets a bonus

168
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,290
doesn't necessarily
mean that Peterson...

169
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,640
What's your
first name, Peterson?

170
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,644
It's Sandy Patterson.

171
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,881
Was that rough?

172
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,651
The first name is...
No, it's Sandy Koufax.

173
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,051
Oh, right.

174
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,850
My dad was a big ball fan.

175
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,849
Let me go cut these checks.

176
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,001
You watch baseball?

177
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,760
It just sounded funny,
the way you said it.

178
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,720
I'll leave that one alone,
it's your dad.

179
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,961
Oh, yeah. No.

180
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,042
Seriously, though, what is
it exactly that you do?

181
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,600
I manage the
in-house accounts, sir.

182
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,563
So, essentially,
you do what the program

183
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,529
that my wife uses,
called Quicken, does.

184
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,291
Well...
You put numbers in boxes.

185
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,050
You could train a baboon
to do it, if you had to.

186
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,646
The fact of the matter is,
the economy is changing.

187
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,960
People like me are important.

188
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,480
We bring the money in and pay
people like you with it.

189
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,721
You understand?

190
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,525
You know what? I'm gonna get you
a copy of The Fountainhead.

191
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,331
You're gonna read it, you're gonna
understand why this is good for everybody.

192
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,323
All right. Let's do it today,
because I gotta get on the plane,

193
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,401
'cause I gotta go to Tahiti.

194
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,641
You're gonna go
to Tahiti today?

195
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,041
Yeah, I'm going today. Not
private, either. Commercial.

196
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,446
Sure. We all have
to take a haircut.

197
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,323
Private would be excessive.
Not you. All right.

198
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,561
Man.

199
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,281
Sandy Patterson.

200
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,250
<i>Hello, Sandy, I'm Jeanette
from Lady's Choice Salon.</i>

201
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,131
<i>I'm calling to confirm your
appointment for this Friday at 3:00.</i>

202
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,801
Sorry, you've got
the wrong number.

203
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,203
<i>Oh, is this
Sandy Bigelow Patterson?</i>

204
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,044
Yeah. But...

205
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,603
"407." Where is that?

206
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,444
<i>Winter Park, Florida.</i>

207
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,490
Okay. You've got Denver, here.
How did you dial this number?

208
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,122
<i>Well, you didn't leave one when you made
the appointment, so we googled you.</i>

209
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,725
I see. Well,
you've got the wrong...

210
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,801
Sorry, buddy.

211
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,724
Can you meet me in the parking garage?
Level 7B.

212
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,802
Sure.
Thanks.

213
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,121
Hey. He's here.

214
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,280
What's this? What's going on?
Is everything all right?

215
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,401
You like getting fucked?

216
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,842
Because that is what's
happening upstairs.

217
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,401
Aren't you sick of
getting fucked by Cornish?

218
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,841
Yeah, I'm a little sore.

219
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,527
We don't like it either.
That's why we're leaving.

220
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,880
We're starting our own firm.
We're taking all our clients.

221
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,567
Come with us.

222
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,846
Come with you?

223
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,491
Sandy, you're the best
at what you do.

224
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,530
You'd be a VP. You'll
have your own office.

225
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,284
What are you making right now?

226
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,801
I make 50.

227
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,286
How about 250?

228
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,241
When are you doing this?

229
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,441
Now.

230
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,161
Now. Today, now?

231
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,361
Come on.

232
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,809
Could I have everybody's
attention please?

233
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,644
The six of us are leaving
to start a new company.

234
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,361
You now have our new
contact information.

235
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,401
If you think of yourself as a
cog, we're not interested.

236
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,720
But if you want to be a
part of building something,

237
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,724
if you want to be a part of
changing this awful business,

238
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,370
stand up now and join us.

239
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,165
That's wonderful, everybody.

240
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,886
Isn't that inspiring?

241
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,561
A start-up.

242
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,045
Please, I invite you, anybody
who wants to join this fellow,

243
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,040
I'm considering it myself.

244
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,004
But if you do join these traitors,
you will live to regret it.

245
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,251
Because this firm has offices in
20 cities in three continents,

246
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,641
and you do not
want us as an enemy.

247
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,285
Last chance.
Who's with us?

248
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,964
I am.
Who said that?

249
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,881
I did.

250
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,730
Sandy. Anybody else
want to join him?

251
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,080
All he's got
are threats, people.

252
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,447
And all they have is Sandy.

253
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,603
You better pray this works. You
better pray this works, Sandy.

254
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,728
You better pray this works,
because I'm coming for you.

255
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,690
And I'm killing you everywhere.
Don't come crawling back!

256
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,280
What?

257
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,451
Oh! Boy, that's nice.

258
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,650
That looks good, that looks good.
I lost my wedding ring. Shh!

259
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,407
Fifteen years of marriage.
Can you believe that?

260
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,081
May I see your ID?
Mmm-hmm.

261
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,241
Yes, you can.

262
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,401
Sandy Bigelow Patterson.

263
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,327
We just got married
back in St. Paul.

264
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,244
Yeah. Howard's a surgeon.

265
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,050
So, he fixes smiles.

266
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,411
Yeah, he's kind of
the big guy for teeth.

267
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,129
My friends took me out
for my birthday.

268
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,971
They made a big deal
out of me turning 30.

269
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,522
I was like,
"Thirty, what? No way."

270
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,325
I mean, I hit it pretty hard
in my twenties, so...

271
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,528
Do you like to hit it hard?

272
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,808
I bet you do.
I bet you can hit that

273
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,561
so hard.

274
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,964
There we go, okay.

275
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,360
Let's get them off it.

276
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,928
Ma'am? Ma'am.

277
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,881
What the fuck?

278
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,768
Ma'am, your card was declined.

279
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,650
Oh, yeah.

280
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,441
Here, use this one.

281
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,081
That one's done.

282
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,801
Great.

283
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,927
Hi. Good morning.

284
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,685
Something wrong with pump five.
It's not taking my card.

285
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,600
Thanks.

286
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,210
You don't pay your bills, man.
I gotta cut the card.

287
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,322
"Cut the card."
No, I absolutely pay my bills.

288
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,970
Run it one more time. Nothing
wrong with that card.

289
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,201
That's not what
it says right here.

290
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,771
I don't care what the screen says.
Maybe it's broken.

291
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,684
I'll go somewhere else.
You're not cutting that card.

292
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,330
Cutting the card?
That's ridiculous.

293
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,209
Tell you what,
I'll go somewhere else.

294
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,407
You go somewhere else?

295
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,165
Look, that's my <i>papi.</i>
He owns this store.

296
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,685
He says cut the card.
<i>Señor.</i>

297
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,842
If you don't pay your bills...
My bills are paid.

298
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,604
Oh, your bills are paid.
I gotta cut the card.

299
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,886
Do not cut that card.

300
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,082
I'm gonna cut the card.
I just cut the card.

301
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,922
Go pay your bills, Randy.
It's Sandy.

302
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,081
Sandy?

303
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,522
How's my credit exceeded?

304
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,720
<i>Well, Mr. Patterson,
your balance is $12,243.67.</i>

305
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:31,687
That's absurd. I use the
card for gas and for coffee.

306
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,044
<i>I'm showing $4,345 from
Great Beyond Water Sports.</i>

307
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,407
Well, I'll stop you there, because
I've never heard of that place.

308
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,968
"Great Beyond Water Sports"?
Nope, I've never been there.

309
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,282
And that was this morning?
I just left the house.

310
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,642
Except for the gas station
that I went to,

311
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,882
where my card
got chopped in half

312
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,725
by an angry man in
a glass box, okay?

313
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,043
So, first things first, I need
a fresh card in the mail.

314
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,244
And Loretta, I need you on
the stick to unscrew me.

315
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,324
This is clearly on your end.
This is not me.

316
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,403
Or I'll fix it.
Where's the surf shop?

317
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,562
<i>Well, sir, it's in
Winter Park, Florida.</i>

318
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,611
Florida? I'm in Colorado,
you know, so...

319
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,410
- Damn it.
<i>- Excuse me?</i>

320
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,528
Unbelievable. I gotta call you back.

321
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,761
<i>Driver.</i>
Sorry!

322
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,081
<i>Pull the vehicle to
the side of the road.</i>

323
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,646
<i>NCIC
says 10-29F, use caution.</i>

324
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,444
Step out of the vehicle,
Mr. Patterson.

325
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,090
Okay, coming out of the
vehicle for hands-free?

326
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,123
That seems just
a little bit excessive.

327
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,247
Mr. Patterson,
you're under arrest.

328
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,321
Under arrest?

329
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,527
You have the right
to remain silent.

330
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,647
Hey, wait a second.

331
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,168
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

332
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,604
The arresting officer ran
your license through the NCIC.

333
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,445
You were booked for felony assault
two weeks ago in Florida.

334
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,126
What? No, I wasn't.
What are you talking about?

335
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,248
I've never even been to Florida.
You've never been to Florida?

336
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,687
No, sir. This whole morning...

337
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,284
Well, hang on a second.
Was it Winter Park, Florida?

338
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,361
See, that's good.

339
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,130
We're dropping the whole
"there's been a mistake" thing.

340
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,691
I got it now. Listen...

341
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,251
The problem is,
Mr. Patterson,

342
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,045
is that you missed your court
date three days ago in Florida.

343
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,280
Officer, let me just explain.

344
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,403
And the judge has issued a
warrant for your arrest.

345
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,161
Yeah...
So what we're gonna do

346
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,970
is we're gonna go ahead and
ship you back down to Florida.

347
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,121
You can work on your tan.

348
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,247
Sir. Yeah, listen.
You're not listening.

349
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,367
Sit down.
Sorry.

350
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,045
There's a person
that has my same name

351
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,565
that is doing
things in Florida.

352
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,645
This guy is making salon appointments,
he's buying beach equipment.

353
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,410
He's maxing out my credit card.

354
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,451
Are you Sandy Bigelow
Patterson, born May 18th, 1974?

355
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,567
That is you, correct?

356
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,205
Yeah, but it's not
me doing this stuff.

357
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,681
I've never even been to the state.
I'm here with you guys.

358
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,081
I'm in Colorado.
How can I be in Florida?

359
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,560
Call Winter Park PD.
Pull the mug shot.

360
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,444
Okay, uncuff him.

361
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,285
Uncuff me. That's great.

362
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,044
Can I see?

363
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,561
Whoa.

364
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,201
Is that a woman?

365
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,051
If I had to guess, it's the
woman that stole your identity,

366
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,124
obviously taking advantage of the
fact that you have a female name.

367
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,009
Oh, it's not female,
it's unisex.

368
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,880
When you say "stole my identity,"
do you mean credit card fraud?

369
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,126
Oh, no, no, it's a lot
worse than that.

370
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,565
See, what happens is,
they get a hold of

371
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,971
your name, your birthday,
Social Security.

372
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,724
And then they run up debt,

373
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,370
get arrested,
commit crimes as you.

374
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,010
What do you do now? You
go down, you go get her?

375
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,249
Oh, no, we don't go get anyone.
Let me walk you out.

376
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,722
See, we're Denver PD. All we
do is open and close the case.

377
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,723
Now, if she buys
something on Amazon,

378
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,609
then Seattle PD
would investigate.

379
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,604
Your mobile company's in Ohio,
then Cleveland PD handles that.

380
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,444
Then so on and so forth
for every single theft.

381
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,682
Well, hang on. How long
does all this take?

382
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,649
About six months to a year.

383
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,721
A Year?

384
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,961
Yeah. So why don't
you go ahead

385
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,082
and just leave your contact
information with this gentleman here?

386
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,288
You might want to hold on to this
mug shot in case you may need it.

387
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,327
Great. Okay.

388
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,970
Listen, I'm gonna
need this solved

389
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,485
a whole lot quicker
than a year, Detective.

390
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,201
Okay, listen, I understand that
this is really frustrating for you,

391
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,527
but our percentage rate in solving
these cases is pretty high.

392
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,647
Yeah? How many?

393
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,000
About 5 to 10 percent.

394
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,167
That's garbage.

395
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,402
We'll be in touch
with you, Sandy.

396
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,120
Hi, I'm Sandy...
Mr. Patterson.

397
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,164
I know who you are.
I'm Jessica. Hi.

398
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,287
Welcome.

399
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,610
Anything you need, just ask.

400
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,091
Your office
is right over there.

401
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,323
Office. Nice to meet you.

402
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,491
Patterson?
Sorry.

403
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,411
I had a hell of a morning.

404
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,527
Listen to this.
Can you explain this to me?

405
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,641
What do you got?

406
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,804
These are emails I received from
a couple of prospective clients.

407
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,961
No, no, no.

408
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,804
You defaulted on
six credit cards?

409
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,882
No, I didn't, actually.
You did.

410
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,081
No. You have nine
other delinquencies.

411
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,400
This is what my morning's
been all about.

412
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,847
Your credit score's a 240.
A 240!

413
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,685
There are homeless people with
better numbers than that, Sandy.

414
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,888
Dude, you have a warrant
out for your arrest.

415
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,530
This is
a financial institution.

416
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,729
How am I supposed to give you
access to $5 billion in funds?

417
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,245
My identity's been stolen.

418
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,121
I was at the police
station all morning.

419
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,481
Don't worry about it, though.

420
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,971
I'm gonna get on the phone,
I'm going to clean it up.

421
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,247
They can run my credit tomorrow
and it's gonna be fine, okay?

422
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,526
What the fuck is this?

423
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,365
Those are cops!
That's my guy.

424
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,363
This is the detective
that's handling my case.

425
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,649
Hi. I was just filling my
boss in on our situation.

426
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,884
Did you find her? Do you
have some good news?

427
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,042
No, I'm sorry, we don't
have any good news.

428
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,646
Soon after you left, we got
a call from Orlando Metro.

429
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,851
They just busted a narcotics
dealer named Paolo Gordon.

430
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,685
Your name and your credit
cards turned up in connection

431
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,091
with the investigation.

432
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,446
Ah! This...

433
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,801
One of my colleagues spoke to your
former employer, Mr. Harold Cornish.

434
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,847
Yeah.

435
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,366
And he said that, in fact,
you are a drug dealer.

436
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,651
That's...
He's a fucking liar.

437
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,451
I've got a warrant
to search the premises.

438
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,204
For drugs.
Oh.

439
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,485
And guns.

440
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,040
This is a waste of time.
I understand.

441
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,646
It's not me, it's the
woman in the picture.

442
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,365
Just doing my job.
I need to put that out.

443
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,010
Okay.

444
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,083
Okay, guys, let's...

445
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,280
Okay, we're done.

446
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,005
You can let your
employees back in now.

447
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,121
Thank you.

448
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,123
So, no Oxy?
No, no Oxy.

449
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,327
Did you find my weapons?

450
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,683
I'm not an idiot,
Mr. Patterson, okay?

451
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,524
I know almost certainly
it's the woman in Florida.

452
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,721
Yeah.

453
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,848
But until we know for sure
that you didn't do this,

454
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,126
it's an open investigation.

455
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,611
For narcotics.

456
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,441
Let me walk you out.

457
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,320
We're gonna have to
talk about our options.

458
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,609
I think we got to let you go.

459
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,444
I know where she is. Hey!

460
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,564
I know exactly where she's
gonna be tomorrow afternoon.

461
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,722
If I tell you, you can tell the
Winter Park Police Department,

462
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,962
they can grab her,
and we're done.

463
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,162
No, no, it doesn't work like that.
Why not?

464
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,561
Well, they'd have to bring her
up on local charges first.

465
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,807
And it would pretty much be about a
year before we get a shot at her.

466
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,043
I mean, she'd have to be standing
right here to do you any good.

467
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,129
That's the new
standard of police work?

468
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,407
I mean, the criminal's got to be
standing right in front of you?

469
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,244
Have a good day.
Hang on, hang on.

470
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,482
If they won't bring her here,
what if I bring her here?

471
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,766
What if, somehow,
I get her here,

472
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,887
and I put her right
in front of you,

473
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,241
she gives you a full statement
and owns up to everything?

474
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,010
Then we'd be done, wouldn't we?

475
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,685
Oh, I wouldn't recommend that,
Mr. Patterson.

476
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,410
You see, criminals
generally just don't

477
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,010
volunteer confessions
to policemen.

478
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,447
All right, what about this?

479
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,841
What about if I ask
her to talk to you?

480
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,004
Because she cost me my job
and I want to get my job back,

481
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,766
and in return,
I don't press any charges.

482
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,366
She doesn't have to worry about me.
There's no cops.

483
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,601
But there are cops.

484
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,808
You're down the hall, you're
listening to a thing. I'm wearing...

485
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,405
What?
That's ridiculous.

486
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,080
No, no, no, this sort of thing
tends to work pretty well. Right?

487
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,605
And we do have enough
for an eavesdrop warrant.

488
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,160
No, no. Sandy, I need somebody
here doing the work right now.

489
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,368
I'm the best at what I do.
Those are your words.

490
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,760
I'm just looking for
a little bit of time.

491
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,321
We don't have time. I'm supposed
to put everything on hold?

492
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,401
We have clients!

493
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,847
Listen, I gave up everything because I
believe in you. Just believe in me.

494
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,605
Come on, you know me.
Come on, Daniel.

495
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,169
I'll give you one week.
Really?

496
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,241
But that's it.

497
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,721
That's all I need. Thank you.

498
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,961
One week, Patterson!

499
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,566
I'm calling to confirm my wife's
appointment for tomorrow at 3:00.

500
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,802
Thank you. She ended up
making the appointment.

501
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,725
I didn't realize that she's
gonna be in the area.

502
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,487
Anyway, I need your address
because she lost it.

503
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,722
Okay. Got it. Thank you.

504
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,922
She'll see you tomorrow
at 3:00. Bye-bye.

505
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,766
Okay. I've got cash for the plane
ticket, I've got my sock money.

506
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,763
Did you call the cab?
Don't do this.

507
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,764
Don't start this again. Trish, I
need you to just hang in there.

508
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,445
This is not who we are.

509
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,005
You're not Batman.
Do not unpack this.

510
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,764
Please, I can't
refold all this stuff.

511
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,649
Do you even know
how to use those?

512
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,802
It's just in case.
It is my only option.

513
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,009
It is our only option.

514
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,920
Let me see the picture
of her again.

515
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,926
Make you feel
better to see that?

516
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,001
Uh-huh.

517
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,441
Yeah. She's not dangerous.

518
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,690
That number right
there is her height.

519
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,042
It's hobbit height.

520
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,291
I'm going after Bilbo.

521
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,402
Yeah, I can do this,
I really can.

522
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,289
But I can't do it
without your support.

523
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,282
Okay? Please trust me.

524
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,521
Thank you.

525
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,644
If all goes well, I'll be right
back here tomorrow night.

526
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,041
Also, I borrowed
your anxiety pills

527
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,645
because I might have to
coax her onto the airplane.

528
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,290
Oh, good.
Okay, that's fine

529
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,961
'cause why would I
need those right now?

530
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,007
I'll call you
when I land, okay?

531
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,201
Goodbye, you guys.

532
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,322
Daddy, the TV's broken.

533
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,688
Oh. Well, you know.
Come here.

534
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,322
Some things are broken,
but only for a few days.

535
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,880
That's why I have
to go on this trip

536
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,365
to pretty much the worst
place in America.

537
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,204
But Daddy's gonna
fix these problems.

538
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,488
When I get back,
it's all gonna be perfect.

539
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,847
I promise, okay? Come here.

540
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,843
It's too late for TV anyway,
you guys are going to bed.

541
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,686
Do some drawing,
and then PJs. Goodbye.

542
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,480
Go get this bitch.

543
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,246
Roger.

544
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,006
Ooh!

545
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,967
Okay.

546
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,201
Okay.

547
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,086
My neck.
Oh, man, I taste blood.

548
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,085
Oh, jeez.

549
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,366
You got an injury.

550
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,562
Oh, my neck. My neck got it.
Sorry about that.

551
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,529
I didn't assume you were
gonna come to a full stop

552
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,721
in the middle of the highway.

553
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,764
Oh, a mama badger and a
baby crossing the road.

554
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,886
A badger, huh?

555
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,371
Yeah. Oh, my God.

556
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,161
My fibromyalgia's just
shooting down my spine.

557
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,004
Jeez Louise.

558
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,248
No, this is totally my fault.
You got your license on you?

559
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,845
Why don't we swap information?

560
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,769
We can get the insurance
companies involved.

561
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,246
I guess that's
what it comes to.

562
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,121
I hate to tell you, but that's
a custom paint job. Thank you.

563
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,967
You know,
if it's okay with you,

564
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:29,647
I'm okay and I'm cool
with just doing cash.

565
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:34,522
Yeah, cash would be a lot easier,
wouldn't it, Sandy Bigelow Patterson?

566
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,567
Yeah.

567
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,165
Bigelow is such a rare name.

568
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,163
Well, it's a family name,
you know.

569
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,130
It goes back to the Mayflower.

570
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,401
Is that right?

571
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,891
Yeah. Jeremiah Bigelow.

572
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,283
Maybe you've heard of him.
Pretty prominent bear hunter.

573
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,090
Sounds brave.
Kind of a big deal.

574
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,722
Here's my license
with my name right there.

575
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,645
Sandy Bigelow Patterson.

576
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,601
Gotcha.

577
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,282
Ow! Not my hair, you fuck!

578
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,444
You're not going anywhere.

579
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,051
Get out of the car!

580
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,322
Ow! Keep it!

581
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,005
Took the lift out of the crown!

582
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,408
I fucking just had it done!

583
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,890
No, no, no!

584
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,481
What, are you crazy?

585
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,565
What are you doing?

586
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,120
You're looking for these? You're
not gonna find them, stupid.

587
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,164
See you, Sandy!

588
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,684
Oh, come on.

589
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,607
Hi.

590
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,887
<i>Hey, it's me.
Is this a bad time?</i>

591
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,008
No, great time.
What's going on, honey?

592
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,289
<i>We just got a call from a debt
collector from Fiat Automotive.</i>

593
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,402
<i>They said we're behind
on some payments.</i>

594
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,366
A call from a...
From a debt collector, huh?

595
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,329
<i>I guess she
bought herself a car.</i>

596
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,482
Well, honey, that is just...

597
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,528
You sound really weird.
Are you sure you're okay?

598
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,525
Yeah, I'm good.

599
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,370
Okay.

600
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,850
Let's see what kind of crap you
have in your bag, Sandy Patterson.

601
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,930
Here you go. Thanks.

602
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,968
Ooh! Nice.

603
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,930
Ding-dong!
Shit.

604
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,320
Put it down.

605
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,928
Now, we're gonna have a little chat.
Okay.

606
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,641
Okay? We can do it the hard way,
or we can do it the easy way.

607
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,050
I'd like to pick the easy way.

608
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,840
Get over here and
give me your wrists.

609
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,649
Okay.

610
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,480
Now, I have a plan...

611
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,402
Shit! I'm a lady,
you fucking animal.

612
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,244
Give me your wrist.
Stop fighting me.

613
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,891
Yeah, I'll fight it. You like that?
You like that?

614
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,008
How about that?
You like hitting girls?

615
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,650
Sandy? This isn't cute, Sandy!

616
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,807
Stay down!

617
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,326
Oh, shit!

618
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,167
Shit.

619
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,126
Shit, shit. Ow!

620
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,207
Ha!

621
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,887
Stay down.

622
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,724
You threw like a fucking girl.

623
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,809
Now, once you hear my plan,
you're gonna wanna come with me.

624
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,724
I'm not going
anywhere with you!

625
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,450
Fuck you, Sandy. Damn it. Stop
right there and listen to me.

626
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:13,286
No, go home to your shitty wife
and your fucking dumb-ass kids.

627
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,407
Stop right there!

628
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,205
Why did you do that?

629
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,441
You did that.

630
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,920
Well, that was not
the easy way.

631
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,526
I loved that guitar.
I'm gonna sue you.

632
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,920
You're gonna sue me?

633
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,970
Really, you're gonna sue me?
Enjoy the empty accounts.

634
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,610
I'll be taking my car keys.

635
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,604
And what are these?

636
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,721
These are future victims?

637
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,086
Put my shit down.

638
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,241
They can thank me later.

639
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,049
Is that how you buy all this crap?
What do you need this for?

640
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,121
You're sick.

641
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,331
This stuff is things I use for my
charity that I help children with.

642
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,487
For the what?

643
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,244
For my children's charity,
you dick.

644
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,681
Oh, that makes sense.
I apologize.

645
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,450
Now, you're coming with me.
Give me your wrist.

646
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,045
What's your name, by the way?

647
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,004
Julia.
Julia?

648
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,369
Diana!
Open the fucking door!

649
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,404
Shit!

650
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,567
Who's that?

651
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,166
Just changing my clothes.
I'll be right out!

652
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:09,006
Don't lie to me. Those credit
cards you sold Paolo were shit.

653
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,889
No, no, no,
it's a misunderstanding.

654
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,884
It will be so funny when I
explain it to you guys.

655
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,610
You're coming with us, now!

656
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,887
Just give me the car keys.

657
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,450
No, you're not
taking the car again.

658
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,246
Shit!

659
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,162
Go, go, go!

660
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,249
What? What the...

661
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,447
You little bitch.

662
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,204
You just make friends
wherever you go, huh?

663
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,283
Who were those people?
Don't worry about it.

664
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,043
And what the hell is that?
Is that a bobby pin?

665
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,361
Yep, sure as shit is.

666
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,806
You're wasting your time.
That's not coming off.

667
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,121
Yeah, we'll see about that.

668
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,930
How about you just apologize
for getting me shot at?

669
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,161
I'm not gonna
apologize for that

670
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:05,291
because you should not
have broken into my home.

671
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,960
So, it's a little
lesson for you, Sandy.

672
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,531
Pull over.
I'm not pulling over.

673
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,205
We're going to an airport

674
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,567
and we're taking the first
flight to Denver, Diana.

675
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,007
Why don't you pull over
before I kick your ass again?

676
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,571
As soon as I explain it, you're
gonna come with me. All right?

677
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,600
I'll tell you what, why don't we find
a bar, we calm down a little bit...

678
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,087
I buy you a drink, I talk, you listen?
Does that sound fair?

679
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,049
That sounds fair, Sandy.

680
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,565
You'll behave yourself
if we find a bar?

681
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,006
Oh, totally.
Great.

682
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,161
Yeah, I'll behave myself

683
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,083
because you will
have probably dosed me

684
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,969
with a shitload of
Trish Patterson's Xanax.

685
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,246
Hey, when did you get those?

686
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,562
I had two hands down your
pants, and you didn't notice,

687
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,563
so you should deal with that.

688
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,046
Fucking dead below the waist.

689
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,167
You're disgusting.

690
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,771
Just pull the car over.

691
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,880
Is that what you want?
Yes.

692
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,411
Jesus Christ, yes.

693
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,922
Here you go. You're sure? Right
in the middle of the highway.

694
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,047
Yeah, right in the middle
of the highway.

695
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,167
Really?

696
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,323
All right. I'll tell you what, then.
I'll just call the police

697
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,050
and I'll tell them that
there's a criminal

698
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,724
out here with a known warrant

699
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,325
just hanging around
the highway.

700
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,244
I got a lot of evidence
they'd like to see.

701
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,651
You got nothing.

702
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,369
Hey! I'm calling
the police right now.

703
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,602
Good luck, pal.
I'll be long gone.

704
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,489
It's ringing.

705
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,010
What are you, a fucking Kenyan?

706
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,371
Listen, I just need
you to talk to my boss.

707
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,885
That's it. And I won't
press charges, okay?

708
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,451
I'm losing my job
because of you.

709
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,646
Your job?
That's right.

710
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,881
I didn't fire you.

711
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,883
Effectively, you did.
I don't think I did.

712
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,400
And I don't wanna go to Colorado
and meet your anxious wife.

713
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,965
You're right, she is anxious.
She's very anxious.

714
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,167
You wanna know why?

715
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,647
Because we have two daughters
and a third on the way.

716
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,040
We live in a very,
very small apartment,

717
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,481
about half the size of that
house I bet you stole.

718
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,961
Hey, I worked hard
for that house.

719
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:46,489
I'm proud of it. I have a
seven-year amorticized sub-rate...

720
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,561
It's amortized.

721
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,723
Well, I can't get into that.
You're not gonna get it.

722
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,847
Enough, all right?

723
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,328
This is a free trip, okay?
It's on me, all right?

724
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,606
No cops.

725
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,364
All you need to do is talk
to my boss, that's it.

726
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,887
And then we're done. That's all.
It's very simple.

727
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,326
Come on, it's in Denver.
You're gonna love it.

728
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,686
There's nobody
shooting at you there.

729
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,240
You stay here,
they're gonna find you.

730
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,406
Hey, hey, hey!

731
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,885
Come on.

732
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,849
This is ridiculous.

733
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,921
Shit.

734
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,001
You blow a tire?

735
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,605
Yeah, I blew a fucking tire.

736
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,121
Why don't you
rest that in the car?

737
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,131
Put the air on.

738
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,245
I won't talk to the cops.

739
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,289
Right, no cops.
I said that.

740
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,401
And don't lie to me.

741
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,249
I'm not.
I'm not lying, I swear.

742
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,845
Yeah? You swear
on your kids?

743
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,284
Yeah, swear on your kids.

744
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,046
Yes, I swear on my kids.

745
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,045
Shotgun.

746
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,326
I'll need the keys.

747
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,561
Here you go.

748
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,404
Thank you.

749
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,448
- Yeah?
<i>- Did you get her?</i>

750
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,521
Almost.

751
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,647
<i>Almost?</i>

752
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,646
Okay, then I almost won't kill
you when I get out of here.

753
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:15,327
She's a nobody who sells
credit cards she already used.

754
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,720
We'll get the money back.

755
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,445
<i>It is beyond that, Marisol.</i>

756
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:22,605
Now, this nobody of yours is
causing me a big problem.

757
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,842
<i>She's become a liability.</i>

758
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,082
One of her cards
tipped off the cops.

759
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,486
She gotta go. You get
Julian and you get it done.

760
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,005
Okay, but she's with some guy.

761
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,448
You kill her, you kill him,
you kill anyone you need to.

762
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,961
Okay.

763
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,849
Speed this
shit up, we gotta go.

764
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,683
- I don't work for you.
- Oh, yes, you do.

765
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,485
Hank!

766
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,965
You got it, Paolo.

767
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,887
So, I was wondering,

768
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,606
how is it that we're
getting on that plane?

769
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,408
I already have my ticket,
and I brought cash for yours.

770
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,325
Are we both going to show our
Sandy Bigelow Patterson,

771
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,801
same birthday, everything,
at the same time?

772
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,009
Let the airline just have a
field day with that, or...

773
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,646
Yeah, that's what I thought.

774
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,171
Son of a bitch!

775
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,564
Well, we're driving now.
We're driving, then.

776
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,085
Okay.

777
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,041
Oh! I can't believe
I missed that.

778
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,569
You've gotta feel so dumb.

779
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,290
Please don't.

780
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,168
Think we just need
a little music.

781
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,691
Dude, I can hit this.

782
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,484
Hello? Yeah?
What do you got?

783
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,961
<i>Got a runner.
Pays 50 K.</i>

784
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,724
50 K?
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

785
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,041
You got a name?

786
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,521
<i>Sandy Patterson. She
skipped a few court dates.</i>

787
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,767
Any leads?

788
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,126
<i>Yeah, she just
swiped a credit card</i>

789
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,646
<i>at a place near you
called Lady's Choice.</i>

790
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,651
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
We're closed.

791
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,644
Do you know a Sandy Patterson?
A customer?

792
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,644
Used a credit card here
earlier today around 4:00?

793
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,040
You her boyfriend or something?

794
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,161
Oh, no, no.

795
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,649
No. I'm a skiptracer.
A collector.

796
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,843
Like a bounty hunter.

797
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,005
I find people that owe money and I
bring them back to where they belong.

798
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,083
Oh, this Sandy, she owe a lot?

799
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,925
Yeah, well, they don't
send me for a little.

800
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,006
No, she jumped bail and I've
been hired to bring her back.

801
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,966
I would like to help you out,

802
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,521
but I ain't supposed to share
client information, so...

803
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,967
Of course, I understand.

804
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,806
This is a nice place.

805
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,927
Yeah.

806
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,329
I hear this stuff's
pretty flammable.

807
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,089
Be a shame if your place of
employment burned to shit.

808
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,721
You want to show me where
that appointment book is?

809
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,921
There you go.

810
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,406
Oh, jeez.

811
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,489
I really do
appreciate your help.

812
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,721
Go on. Take it.

813
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,246
Now, how about a smile?

814
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,243
Look at you light up a room.

815
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,120
I'm gonna have a hard time
forgetting that face.

816
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,407
You go on and forget
about this one.

817
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,362
Yeah, not what I was planning,

818
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,490
but I will be home on Sunday
or Monday by the latest.

819
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,201
It is what it is, I guess.
How are the girls?

820
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,210
Okay. I love you, too.

821
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,966
I'll call you later. Bye.

822
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,931
How long have you
guys been together?

823
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,605
I'm not going to
talk about myself.

824
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,600
Or my family. You're never going
to know anything about me.

825
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,644
There's nothing wrong
with being a simple guy.

826
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,006
I'm just a simple gal.

827
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:27,169
From Wisconsin. You know?
I'm a cheesehead.

828
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,367
Fascinating.

829
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,481
I'm from Morganville.

830
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,211
It's a little, tiny town,
but charming.

831
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,447
I don't care.

832
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,887
Mom's 70. Still working.

833
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,611
Dad retired about, I guess, two and a...

834
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,888
I want to say two and a half years.
Two, two and a half...

835
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,929
Jesus Christ.
Two and a half years ago.

836
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,122
He was a principal
at a middle school.

837
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,361
They sound so normal.

838
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,522
How'd they have a criminal
asshole for a daughter

839
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,045
who just goes around
wrecking people's lives?

840
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,246
How'd that work out?

841
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:56,087
I think you're painting it with
the most negative brush possible.

842
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,605
I bet that they would paint
it the same exact way.

843
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,001
I mean, what you do is...
I use the system.

844
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,245
I use the system that's provided...
You cheat the system.

845
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,288
Now, the fact that I... No,
I do not cheat the system.

846
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,482
I use the system.
If there's a loophole,

847
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,891
and I go through the loophole,

848
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,525
I'm not doing anything wrong.

849
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,563
You create a lot
of destruction.

850
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,530
You know, it's not my fault if people
don't check their own finances.

851
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,486
All you do is make one call
to the credit card company,

852
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,763
they take the charge off.
It's a victimless crime...

853
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:23,841
You don't take any
accountability for this?

854
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,843
It's not a victimless...
I'm a victim!

855
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,369
We're kind of in the midst of a
pivotal moment here, you know?

856
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,561
This is...

857
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,966
I think we might want
to take stock of this.

858
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:37,203
We're kind of bonding.

859
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,730
It's kind of like family,
or brother and sister,

860
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,004
if brother and sister were

861
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,923
pretty attracted to each other.

862
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,209
We are just driving to Denver.
There will be nothing else.

863
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,324
I just thought,

864
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,568
in the spirit of honesty,
I'd put out there

865
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,131
that I visually enjoy you.

866
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,726
Hmm.

867
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:02,682
And I've always, you know,
really liked tall men.

868
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,963
What are you talking...
I'm average height.

869
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,320
Not to me, stretch.

870
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,441
Great.

871
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,127
Look at that.
See that? "Adventure."

872
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,964
I love that.

873
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,201
When are we going to pull over?

874
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,327
We're not.

875
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:21,326
You know, they say driving tired is
more dangerous than driving drunk

876
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,960
and that's a statistical fact.

877
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,167
I doubt it.

878
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,087
You know,
I drive drunk all the time.

879
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,967
Never had a problem. I slept-drove
once and I smashed into an Arby's.

880
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,201
Take a nap.

881
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:38,081
All right. Whatever you say.
Going down. Thank you.

882
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,047
Uh-oh.

883
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,121
What happened?

884
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,970
You look taller from down here.

885
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,805
Welcome to the Colonnade.

886
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,166
How y'all doing?

887
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,368
Good.
We're famished, though.

888
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,807
We just drove all
the way from Gibson, so.

889
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:00,966
You know what, do you think we can
maybe have a booth instead of a table?

890
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,408
It's just it's real hard for Walt
there to sit on a hard chair,

891
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,642
'cause of his accident
and he, uh...

892
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,161
You know what I mean?
He doesn't...

893
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,249
Just right at the base.

894
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,568
Okay?
Okay. Yeah.

895
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,121
Come on.

896
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,924
Oh! This is nice.

897
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,723
It's nice and soft, Walt.
You like that.

898
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,291
Just leave me out of
the school plays, okay?

899
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,486
I'm not comfortable with it.

900
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,485
Now, I have allotted
us each $8 per meal,

901
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:42,245
so it looks like
you can get one of the...

902
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,569
One of the salads
or a soup or...

903
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:45,801
Sorry, I'm quick.

904
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,327
The tomato soup for me,
please. That'll do it.

905
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,165
I'm going to take a full
slab of the baby backs,

906
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,131
and I'm going to take that
with mashed taters,

907
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:58,251
hushpuppies and I'm going
to have a sweet tea.

908
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,521
The fuck you are.

909
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,322
I don't know what that means.

910
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,284
I asked you to eat less food.

911
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:07,921
What is wrong with you?

912
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,770
This is a beautiful woman.

913
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,161
You let her eat.

914
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,169
No, he's right.

915
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:17,767
You know, I've put on a little bit
of weight because of all the stress.

916
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,883
Walter is a fireman.

917
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,691
Yeah. It's okay, it's okay.

918
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,565
He was in a pretty intense...

919
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,721
She doesn't care.

920
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,691
...accident last year, and
he injured his male parts.

921
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,328
Oh. They're just
shredded down there.

922
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,925
And now he can't work.

923
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:36,889
He wants to fight fires,

924
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,564
and he wants to
pee standing up.

925
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:43,726
Don't you want to pee standing up?
I know you do, but he can't.

926
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,926
Just bring two soups.

927
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,846
And he can't lay with me
like a husband should,

928
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,331
on account of the injury.

929
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,560
And I don't even need him to,

930
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,923
but he gets mad at me,
and takes his anger out on me.

931
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,645
And then I feel
bad about myself

932
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,290
and I feel ugly,
and then I eat.

933
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,807
Lord knows, I know I eat.
I know I do.

934
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,482
No, no. You just wait
right here, sweetheart, okay?

935
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,846
Okay.

936
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,200
I'm going to wait right here.

937
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:08,321
<i>God.</i>

938
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,561
You're breaking the rules.

939
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,045
You understand that?
You're breaking the rules.

940
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,964
Society can't function
without rules.

941
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,166
Ah.

942
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,287
You follow the rules, right?

943
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,407
I sure do.

944
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,244
Oh, yeah, how's that
working out for you?

945
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,328
Yeah. Hold on just a minute.

946
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:28,530
This is from the buffet,
and it is on the house.

947
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:29,841
That's so sweet.

948
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,286
Enjoy your soup.

949
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,651
And if you have to pee, the
ladies' room is right back there.

950
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,726
God bless you. God bless you.
All right. Okay, okay.

951
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,371
You know what a sociopath is?

952
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,684
Do they like ribs?

953
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,930
Hey, how you doing? I need
one room, two beds, please.

954
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,001
Oh, sorry.

955
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,242
We only have
single beds left tonight.

956
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,686
Are you kidding me?
Nope.

957
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,888
We don't really mind.
I mean, it's an inconvenience,

958
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,248
but my husband can't really
digest stuff anyway

959
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:07,045
because of his intestinal surgery,
so just comp us the mini-bar.

960
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,440
He can digest Pringles.

961
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,762
Right, that's right. I'm Walt.
This is the wife, Myra.

962
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,446
She's a functional idiot.
Wears diapers like a chimp.

963
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,125
I'm running her
down to Disneyland.

964
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,645
She loves the noise
and the sugar.

965
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:17,767
He's just tired from the drive.

966
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,410
We're going to have to figure
out the mattress thing

967
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,845
because even though
I can't have sex with her

968
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,724
due to my cock and balls
getting shot off

969
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,040
in an apparent
warehouse fire...

970
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,047
Oh, shit.

971
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,640
I wouldn't share
a bed with her anyway.

972
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,166
I'd much rather sleep on the floor.
Do you want to know why?

973
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,321
Because you got no dick?

974
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,370
Close. It's because
she repulses me.

975
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,288
She's the worst
person I've ever met.

976
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,007
Screw you. You got a bar?

977
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,889
Yeah, the Foxhole.
It's across the lot.

978
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,122
Thank you. You're not
going to the Foxhole.

979
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,045
Hey. I don't need to go to Denver.
You need me to go to Denver.

980
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,123
No splitting up.

981
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:49,401
Do you still want the room?

982
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,289
Yeah, I do, real quick.

983
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:52,521
Fucking chimp on the loose.

984
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,842
It's not my business, I'm
really sorry about your dick,

985
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:58,960
but you got to treat your lady
better, or somebody else is gonna.

986
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:02,000
Appreciate it. Are we on the set
of your talk show right now?

987
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,483
Do you know what?
Being nice is a choice.

988
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:05,880
Can I just get the fucking key?

989
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,129
Uh... Oh!
Are you in a hurry?

990
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,125
Oh, no.

991
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,044
I have to go get
this magnetized,

992
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,849
because it wasn't
magnetized properly.

993
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,321
This might take a while.

994
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,365
Can I have a double melon ball?

995
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,961
Thanks.

996
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,840
Is that a melon ball?

997
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:28,527
Yep.

998
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,606
Do you like milkshakes?

999
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,245
I'm just trying
to have a drink.

1000
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:39,041
Sorry, that probably sounded like
a dumb pickup line, I apologize.

1001
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,484
I don't like milkshakes,
I love them.

1002
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,246
You're going to
flip out over these.

1003
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,448
Stu, mix us up
two grasshoppers.

1004
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,481
Oh!

1005
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,006
I'm Big Chuck.

1006
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,400
Yes, you are.

1007
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,207
I'm Margie.

1008
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:03,322
Pleasure to make your acquaintance.
You, too.

1009
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,440
I love a man
that wears jewelry.

1010
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,250
Thank you very much.

1011
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,925
I like my turquoise
like I like my women,

1012
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,923
American and top-grade.
Oh!

1013
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,681
100%.

1014
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,364
100%.

1015
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,091
To you.

1016
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,090
You know what they say
about grasshoppers?

1017
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,161
Mmm-mmm.

1018
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,925
Hard on the outside and soft
and creamy on the inside.

1019
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,361
Oh, I always like
soft and creamy.

1020
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:34,363
I'm soft and creamy.
I know you are.

1021
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,402
Why don't we go make sure
that table's okay?

1022
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,606
Looks like it's in danger.

1023
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:44,651
Let me get your bag.

1024
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:49,327
I'd like you to get that,
like you to get that.

1025
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,600
I'll just get
your drink for you.

1026
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,642
Why don't you get that?
I'll get that.

1027
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,484
You wait here.
I'll be right back.

1028
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:12,521
I'm back.

1029
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,161
Agile.

1030
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,440
Quick like a panther.

1031
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:19,923
Cheers to you.
Cheers to you.

1032
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,680
Release it. Let it burn.

1033
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,004
Mmm!
Mmm mmm mmm.

1034
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:34,681
Down it goes.

1035
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,407
Hey.

1036
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,721
You're here five minutes, you
already made a friend, huh?

1037
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,405
This must be Walter.

1038
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,481
- Walter.
- Hello.

1039
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,642
Howdy, Walt. I'm Big Chuck.
Hi, there.

1040
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:51,043
I got to tell you, this little
Margie is quite a lady.

1041
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,202
- Oh, "Margie"?
- Sit your ass down.

1042
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,886
Drinks are on me. Stu's going to set you up.
I wish I could.

1043
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:58,042
Stu, let's get Walt a round.
His dick's broken.

1044
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,204
It's much, much too late.
Never mind, Stu. I got to...

1045
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:03,522
Honey, I got to
get you out of here.

1046
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:07,361
Here's the thing,
I don't want to go.

1047
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:08,561
But it's super late.

1048
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,041
We got to get all the way
to St. Louis tomorrow, so...

1049
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,282
Then you should go, honey.

1050
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,887
But you are with me, honey.

1051
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:19,487
All right, listen up. I don't want
to get between husband and wife.

1052
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:22,040
You're not. You're not, believe me.
Is it Chuck?

1053
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,770
Yeah, Big Chuck.
Big Chuck.

1054
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:27,805
You're not, Big Chuck. I get it.
So, can we?

1055
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,085
I think we got a good one.

1056
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,447
What is that?

1057
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,045
I think we got a good one.

1058
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:35,925
Listen, I'm going to
tell you what's going on.

1059
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,250
Walt likes to watch.

1060
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,245
Walt's a watcher.

1061
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,001
Oh!

1062
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,287
No.

1063
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,806
You like to spectate, huh?
That's funky, man.

1064
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,008
You like a show?
He loves it.

1065
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,686
Okay. He likes to
just plan it all out,

1066
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,081
like what he's gonna say
and his little outfit.

1067
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,640
His gray shirt and his
stupid hands on his hips.

1068
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,006
He's like, "I'm gonna
come in and say,"

1069
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,764
"'What are you doing
with my wife?"'

1070
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,444
But what he really wants is...

1071
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,966
He likes to watch
me with other men.

1072
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,121
He does?

1073
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:07,611
Yeah, that's how
he gets aroused.

1074
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,205
You got a little
bone-bone now, huh?

1075
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,368
I'd really like to go, though.

1076
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,887
Here we go. It's time to go.
He said so.

1077
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,161
Yeah.

1078
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,890
And I'm going to go
out on the dance floor

1079
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,007
and we're going
to dance real slow.

1080
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,047
No, no, no.

1081
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:22,567
And we're going to dance real
close, and you can stay and watch.

1082
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:25,007
Or you can go.
That's your choice.

1083
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,730
I can't go.
You know I can't go.

1084
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,041
Thanks for your help, pal.

1085
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:31,284
Well, well.
We got us a watcher.

1086
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:34,091
Ohhh! We got a watcher!

1087
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,001
Honey, look.

1088
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,962
Walt!

1089
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,404
Let's drop this sucker
into first.

1090
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:10,404
Let's take this party up to the room.
All right.

1091
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:15,049
Do you realize how long it's been since
I've been touched below the waist?

1092
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:16,681
It's been a long time.

1093
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,810
You really want me
to answer that?

1094
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,406
Ain't happening tonight, either.
Oh, yes, it is!

1095
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,970
Hey, you snuck up on me. Hey!

1096
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,041
Come on.

1097
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,250
Thanks for the walk home.

1098
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:30,768
We made it, but as you can see,
lam getting ready for bed.

1099
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,726
Please say your goodnights. No,
no, meaning, "Leave, please."

1100
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,640
Don't shut the door.
Leave it...

1101
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,240
Now what do I do?

1102
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,767
Oh, now, this is
his favorite part.

1103
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:42,961
Okay.

1104
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,570
He likes to be
humiliated verbally.

1105
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:45,766
No, I don't.

1106
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,888
You little sissy boy. Huh?

1107
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,086
It's enough of this.

1108
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,731
Sissy boy, huh?
You hard now?

1109
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,241
I'm inverted.

1110
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:56,728
Now it's time to give him
the Big Chuck show.

1111
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:04,244
No need for the show.
Put it back on.

1112
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:21,288
Mmm-mmm.
I've had enough show.

1113
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,041
Oh! Shake it,
shake it, shake it!

1114
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,206
Ohhh! Look at him
peeking over here.

1115
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,964
I can't let her
out of my sight.

1116
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,441
He's not going anywhere. You
are right in his sweet spot.

1117
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,846
Now what do I do?

1118
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,685
I want you to
take him physically.

1119
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:41,127
Let's not cross a line.
Hey, Chas.

1120
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,930
Relax, Walt.
Friend.

1121
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,525
Big Chuck likes to share.

1122
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:45,806
I don't want
anything you've got.

1123
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:49,601
Why don't you and me share?

1124
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:50,927
Okay. God damn it.

1125
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,286
I'm sleeping in the bathroom.

1126
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,562
Oh! Here it comes.

1127
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:58,007
There it was, right there.
Uh-oh!

1128
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:01,127
Looks like it's
just me and you now.

1129
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:08,487
It sure is. I'm going to
make tonight so special.

1130
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,848
Backing up. Oh, no!

1131
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,923
You know what?

1132
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:17,007
I'm going to swim in there.

1133
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:23,404
I'm going to make you one of
my special famous cocktails.

1134
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:26,530
Well, I hope that cocktail
has a punch.

1135
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:28,648
Oh, you know what?
You're going to love it.

1136
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,401
I'm going to love it
because you made it.

1137
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:37,767
It's going to be so good.

1138
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,602
I don't know if I can do this.

1139
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,210
Yeah, that's okay.

1140
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:02,489
I wasn't really in
the mood for it anyway.

1141
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,085
No, I'm sorry.

1142
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,401
It's not a big deal.

1143
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:08,404
It's just that I ain't been with
another woman since my wife passed.

1144
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:14,962
And I'm sorry, because here you
are, and you're so beautiful.

1145
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,008
And you're so colorful.

1146
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,728
You look
like Dorothy from <i>The Oz.</i>

1147
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:25,645
Flowers.

1148
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,327
And I do, I appreciate y'all

1149
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:34,803
inviting me up here to your super
fucking weird sexual tryst,

1150
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:38,641
but I'm scared.

1151
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,570
Oh, Big Chuck.

1152
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:43,405
I do like you.

1153
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:45,930
I really do.

1154
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,163
Margie.

1155
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:54,881
Yes?

1156
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,608
I do want to make love to you.

1157
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,769
Oh, my God. Take me.

1158
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,121
Oh, God!

1159
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,248
Call me Big Papa Huge Time.
Big Papa Huge Time!

1160
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,323
Call me Big Papa Huge Time.

1161
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,970
Big Papa Huge Time!

1162
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,129
Shut up!

1163
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:19,885
- Oh!
- Oh, God!

1164
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,007
Feel the thunder, baby!

1165
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:22,645
Get on top!

1166
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:26,123
Fuck me!

1167
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,606
Break my hip!
I'll break it.

1168
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:28,960
Break my fucking hip!

1169
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:32,607
Rub it clockwise!
Clockwise, clockwise!

1170
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,649
What do you say?
I say, "Mama."

1171
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,962
Stick them both in. Pull them taut.

1172
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,088
How many is that?
What the hell is that?

1173
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,281
Come on!

1174
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:41,646
Stop! Foxhole! Foxhole!

1175
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,764
The safe word's "foxhole,"
God damn it!

1176
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:52,965
Here it comes!

1177
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:54,401
Mmm.

1178
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:57,410
Big Chuck will be ready for
round two in just a minute.

1179
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,649
I'll tell
you, Walt's a lucky guy.

1180
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:03,163
You are such a good person.

1181
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:30,121
Diana?

1182
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:39,081
Diana!

1183
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:25,289
<i>Hello? Daddy?</i>

1184
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:28,647
<i>Daddy. Hello?</i>

1185
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:30,841
<i>Are you there?</i>

1186
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,205
Fuck.

1187
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:04,122
I was just checking our ice.

1188
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,001
Morning.

1189
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:32,167
I just have flashes of
hearing an elephant and...

1190
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:34,482
Oh, God.
I'm just real sore.

1191
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,608
I'll bet you're just torn to shit.
Get in the car.

1192
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,160
I think he really ripped it.

1193
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:39,481
You might have to look.

1194
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:41,642
I'm going to return the
card key to the front desk.

1195
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,489
I'm going to be watching. If you
take a step out of the car,

1196
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:44,971
I'm going to kill you. I'm serious.
Get in the car.

1197
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:47,247
I got to have the keys.
I got to put the air on.

1198
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:48,890
Never going to happen.
Swing a leg.

1199
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,440
Can you get me
some Strawberry Quik?

1200
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:52,084
Because I gotta
balance my electrolytes.

1201
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:53,241
If they've got it.

1202
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,689
Strawberry Quik.

1203
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:02,331
Hey. Good morning.
I'm checking out of 192.

1204
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,047
Did you enjoy your stay, sir?

1205
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:06,121
No.

1206
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:07,526
That's good.

1207
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,489
Do you sell Strawberry Quik?

1208
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:11,210
Yes. You want some?

1209
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:12,681
Not today.

1210
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:17,284
This coffee over here free?

1211
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,044
Yeah.
Super.

1212
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:23,330
Creamer used to be 50 cents, but
everyone was stealing it anyway.

1213
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:25,530
Okay.

1214
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:43,727
The interstate is just south of here, right?
Is there a gas...

1215
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:46,566
You fucking dick!

1216
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,129
No, no! God! Ow!

1217
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:53,402
No! Shit!

1218
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:57,811
Hey!

1219
01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:59,127
Hey!

1220
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:01,081
Hey!

1221
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,365
- Hey.
<i>- Hey, there.</i>

1222
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:19,481
Got her.

1223
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:22,927
See you in an hour?

1224
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,445
<i>Yeah, why don't you bring
her to the Atlanta office?</i>

1225
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:25,761
<i>It's right off the 75...</i>

1226
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:28,082
Excuse me, sir.
Did you take my friend?

1227
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:29,611
I gotta go. No.

1228
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,046
Come on, I saw you take her.

1229
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,049
Well, then don't
ask me, shithead.

1230
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:35,600
Sandy! Get me out
of this fucking van!

1231
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:36,926
I got it.

1232
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:38,690
Hey! Can you pull over, pal?
I need her.

1233
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:40,684
Your girlfriend's
in a lot of trouble.

1234
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:42,410
She's not my girlfriend.
Watch out.

1235
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,090
Hey! You get back there!

1236
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:55,646
Hey, buddy.

1237
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,564
That's not Sandy Patterson.

1238
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:59,210
Yes, it is.
No, you got the wrong guy.

1239
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:00,964
It's me, I'm Sandy Patterson.

1240
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:02,610
No, Sandy's a girl's name.

1241
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,125
It's not, it's unisex!

1242
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:05,725
What, like a hermaphrodite?

1243
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,325
Sandy!

1244
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:08,561
Fuck you, tranny!

1245
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,768
Get me out of this van.

1246
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:13,921
Hey, hey, hey!

1247
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:18,321
Shit.

1248
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:36,009
Hey, hey, I got her first.
Pull over.

1249
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:38,208
You can't have her!
Shit!

1250
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:46,965
Shit.

1251
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,001
Motherfucker.

1252
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:17,210
Listen, God damn it!

1253
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:18,566
Ram him.
Do what?

1254
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,324
Ram the quarter panel.

1255
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:22,409
I don't have collision on this!

1256
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:23,761
I don't give a shit!
Ram him!

1257
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:24,921
I'm not doing it.

1258
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:30,405
You son of a bitch.

1259
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:34,246
Get in the back!
No!

1260
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,562
Get off of me, you asshole!

1261
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:42,361
Shit.

1262
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:43,771
Did you punch him in the neck?

1263
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:45,405
I can't get him off the wheel.

1264
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:46,721
Pull over to the side.

1265
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:49,207
I can't get him
off the wheel. Ram him.

1266
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:50,930
I'm not comfortable with it!

1267
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:52,809
I don't give a shit!
Ram that panel!

1268
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:00,361
Shit.

1269
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:04,245
Hit it harder,
you fucking vagina!

1270
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:48,567
I'm going to be sick.

1271
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:49,766
You Okay?

1272
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,484
Are you all right?
You're bleeding.

1273
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:53,801
Are you okay?
Oh, shit.

1274
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:55,166
That was so violent.
Tell me you're all right.

1275
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:56,361
I am all right. Yeah.

1276
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:57,646
Okay. All right, okay.

1277
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:58,761
Oh, God.

1278
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:01,440
Okay. All right. This guy
does not look great.

1279
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:02,521
Hey!

1280
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,086
Oh, God.

1281
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:05,811
Maybe he's just...

1282
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,081
That doesn't look good.

1283
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:09,322
I can't believe I did that.

1284
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:13,805
You did it. You did it.
God, you did it too hard.

1285
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:16,690
I tried a small one
on the first one.

1286
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,041
And you said...
What did you call me?

1287
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,168
I called you names, okay?

1288
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,924
Your rental car doesn't
even have a scratch on it.

1289
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,323
Yeah, that's great news.
The car is fine.

1290
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:27,681
What's more important...

1291
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,726
God. My glasses
were in there.

1292
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:54,249
Well, you've come
to the right man.

1293
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:57,051
Anybody looking to buy or
sell anything around here,

1294
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,531
they come through me.

1295
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,449
All right.
How much is this one?

1296
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:02,804
That one is 350,000.

1297
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,041
350?

1298
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:07,568
I can get this for 100,000,
easy, at a short sale.

1299
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:11,202
Well, I'm impressed. Clearly, you
both have done your research.

1300
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:13,010
So, I'm also sure that you know

1301
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:14,730
that this is
a traditional community.

1302
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,202
What this means?
"Traditional"?

1303
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:19,289
It means no homosexuals.

1304
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:21,966
It means no foreigners.

1305
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:23,969
It means no blacks.

1306
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:25,890
We are two of those things.

1307
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:29,644
Hey, you two of these things.

1308
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:32,804
I mean, around these parts,
you're basically black.

1309
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:35,920
And a foreigner.
I'm just black.

1310
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:37,730
Now, understand, me myself?

1311
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:40,082
I am not a judgmental man.

1312
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:43,244
But you should know that the
buyers and the sellers here,

1313
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:44,686
their values are more...

1314
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:45,841
Traditional.

1315
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:47,606
Bingo, sister.

1316
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:50,604
Traditional, like meeting
whores at hotel bars?

1317
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:54,327
Who are you?

1318
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:57,046
Your whore,
she's in a rental car.

1319
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:00,010
We called up our friends in the
company, they look up the Lo-yack.

1320
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:01,281
The what?

1321
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:04,011
LoJack. Foreigners,
they can't say J's.

1322
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:05,760
And they say it's at a hotel.

1323
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:07,484
The people at the hotel
gave us a story

1324
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:11,326
about you and another man and her,
all sexing together in a pile.

1325
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,331
It's disgusting.

1326
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:16,051
But to answer your question, the
Lo-yack is an excellent product.

1327
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:17,850
It makes our work much easy.

1328
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:19,601
What kind of work?

1329
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:22,723
This our work.

1330
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:23,881
Oh.

1331
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,327
Very traditional.
Know what I'm saying, Chuck?

1332
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:31,008
Now, who is she with,
and where is she going?

1333
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:33,169
It's not a true allergy,

1334
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:36,085
but there's definitely
a sensitivity.

1335
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:38,771
I need that other roll of tape.

1336
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:41,161
What are you doing?
Is he still... Tape?

1337
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:43,647
I need the other roll of tape.

1338
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:45,529
You're taping him?

1339
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:48,411
Oh, Jesus, it's here.
Yes, I'm taping him.

1340
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:51,967
No, no. Oh, no!

1341
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,809
God damn it!

1342
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:58,525
I told you it
was going to overheat.

1343
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,080
I said you better
coast down the hill.

1344
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:03,607
How am I supposed to propel down
the fucking highway in neutral?

1345
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:05,290
I said I could show you.

1346
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:14,011
I'm going to give you a juice.
It's fruit punch.

1347
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:17,281
Yeah, that's nice and juicy.

1348
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:20,447
These are nice,
I'll tell you that.

1349
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:22,284
God, you keep yourself up.

1350
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,410
That's just...

1351
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:27,450
Oh, God, your beard
smells like sandwiches.

1352
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:28,521
That's nice.

1353
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:43,210
Okay, listen, the...

1354
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:44,406
Say goodbye to
your art project.

1355
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:45,720
The bus station's
down the road.

1356
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:47,330
- We can walk it. Let's go.
- Coming.

1357
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:49,050
Wherever you are,

1358
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:53,689
you better believe I'm going
to find you, or die trying.

1359
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:56,206
All right.

1360
01:10:56,360 --> 01:11:00,684
I get it, scary, survival,
end-of-days guy.

1361
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:03,161
You should be nicer.
I gave you juice.

1362
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:15,084
No, it was a van that crashed.

1363
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:17,720
A couple of people
got in, drove away.

1364
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:21,646
Kind of an average fella,
short gal, somewhat wide.

1365
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:24,451
Took off north
on the 520 right there.

1366
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:31,851
Yeah, I'm fine. We're
still on course, honey.

1367
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:35,326
I don't know. Where Yoda lives.

1368
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,887
"These are not the droids
you're looking for."

1369
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,041
Remember...
Tell her that.

1370
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,847
I know it. Honey, you're
breaking up a little bit.

1371
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:45,209
Honey? Hello?

1372
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,001
Shit.

1373
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:49,049
How's everything going at home?

1374
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:50,810
I don't know.
We didn't get that far.

1375
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:52,962
Because I'm out here.

1376
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:58,486
I guess I should thank you
for saving me back there.

1377
01:11:58,840 --> 01:11:59,841
You're a good friend.

1378
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:01,007
I'm not your friend.

1379
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:03,242
I am not your friend,
we're not hanging out.

1380
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:06,529
I heard you yell to that guy,
"Did you take my friend?"

1381
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:09,206
Yeah, that's a saying. You haven't
heard that saying before?

1382
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,681
Besides, friends don't steal
friends' identities, do they?

1383
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:14,481
You're diabolical.

1384
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:15,966
Well, thanks.

1385
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:17,320
That's not a compliment.

1386
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:18,521
I know.

1387
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:23,045
Here we go.
Here we go.

1388
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:25,244
Aw, come on!

1389
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:26,561
You're doing great.

1390
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:28,521
You are going to have to
hide on the next one.

1391
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:29,891
It's clearly you.

1392
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:31,246
Oh, it's me.

1393
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:34,609
I have never been passed up
when I got this thing out.

1394
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:37,040
I don't doubt that you do
real well on the side of the road.

1395
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:38,411
But I don't know why
you're not trusting this.

1396
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:39,561
Stop for one second.

1397
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:42,086
It is only two miles
straight through there.

1398
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:43,969
Two miles through the woods?

1399
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,728
Yeah. Are you allergic
to woods or something?

1400
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:48,684
Come on, you want to go
10 more miles on this road?

1401
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:49,881
Get some more blisters?

1402
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:52,122
Come on, that's a shortcut.

1403
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:56,967
Yes? There's a yes. Finally.

1404
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:59,649
I knew you were probably wrong.

1405
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:01,161
I knew your phone
was going to die.

1406
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:02,640
I should've said something.

1407
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,962
You knew it. What are you?
You're like a psychic, huh?

1408
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:06,929
Well, you know what? I am.

1409
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:08,640
I'm not going to
get into it, but I am.

1410
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:11,331
Really? On top of everything
else, you're a psychic.

1411
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:13,130
That's amazing.

1412
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:14,970
Pick a number between 1 and 10.

1413
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:19,805
Four.
Four.

1414
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:23,811
I know, it was a gift.

1415
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,367
Your gifts abound.
That's amazing.

1416
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:28,204
I think so, too.

1417
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:31,445
Then why don't you rest
your talents, Megamind.

1418
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,250
The sun is going to
be up in a few hours,

1419
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:35,448
and we'll take it
the rest of the way.

1420
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,843
Hey, hey, hey. Spread out.

1421
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,729
You've got the whole forest,
what are you doing?

1422
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:46,121
It's cold. This is what
they do on Survivor.

1423
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:48,647
When they want to get punched?
Get off of me.

1424
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,564
Do you usually listen to music

1425
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:56,806
before you go to bed?

1426
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:59,247
No, just a lot of silence.

1427
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,086
Oh, my God.

1428
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:11,600
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1429
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,086
You're like a four-year-old.

1430
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:19,521
You know, this light is very
flattering on your chin.

1431
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:24,929
Oh, my God. Diana.

1432
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:27,606
I'm serious, get your hand off. Please,
I don't want to play footsies.

1433
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:28,886
I'm not doing anything.

1434
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:32,124
Snake! Snake! Snake!
Oh, my God!

1435
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:33,321
Shit.

1436
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:35,084
Get away from me!

1437
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:38,761
Throw him! Throw him!

1438
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:44,320
Oh, God, it was so close to me.

1439
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,170
Thanks for the help.
You're welcome.

1440
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:48,651
This is no longer
our sleeping spot.

1441
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:50,006
There's probably
a fucking ton of them.

1442
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:52,083
They're not
pack animals, Sandy.

1443
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:54,004
I know they're not
pack animals, okay?

1444
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:55,761
But have you ever heard of a snake nest?

1445
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:56,961
Oh, shit.

1446
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:59,281
Just the mere thought of that
is going to keep me up...

1447
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:00,846
Oh, God.

1448
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:02,121
Don't move.

1449
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:03,645
Not a problem.
I'm not moving.

1450
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:05,450
Shit, it's huge!

1451
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:07,130
No shit. Get him off me.

1452
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:09,487
Okay. I got it.

1453
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:11,480
What's the plan with the fire?

1454
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:12,646
What are you
doing with the fire?

1455
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:13,767
Get away from me
with that thing.

1456
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:16,002
I saw it on a television show.
Snakes hate fire.

1457
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:18,481
Unless that was about spiders.
I don't know.

1458
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,290
You're going to burn me, and
you're going to piss him off.

1459
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:22,806
Get away from me.
Be quiet and stay still.

1460
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:24,160
Get away from me
with that thing.

1461
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:26,330
Oh, God!

1462
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,006
That's not helping.

1463
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:30,527
It just keeps looking at me.

1464
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:32,327
Oh, he's tightening.

1465
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:37,170
Turn your face away.

1466
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:38,287
Okay.

1467
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:40,488
It's almost over.

1468
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:45,170
Trouble.
He's got the neck.

1469
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:52,290
God! Don't let it
come near me.

1470
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,447
That hurts!

1471
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:57,527
That hurt. That hurts!

1472
01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:58,841
Oh, God.

1473
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:18,681
Okay.

1474
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,848
Okay. Go slow, fella.

1475
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,731
Just go slow. Easy.

1476
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:27,570
Where are we?
What is this?

1477
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:30,200
Bus station, middle of nowhere.

1478
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:32,281
Whose pants are these?

1479
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:34,084
I got them out of
the lost and found.

1480
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:36,046
It's a good fit, huh?

1481
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:38,607
Yeah. Okay.
Better get on a bus.

1482
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:43,240
We're not getting on any bus
for three days, not to Denver.

1483
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:44,321
What?

1484
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,767
There's not a bus from here
to Denver for three days.

1485
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:50,246
Hey. When's
the next bus to Denver?

1486
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:52,446
Wednesday.

1487
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:57,246
Fuck! That's too late.

1488
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:06,126
Phone's gone, wallet's gone
because the pants are gone.

1489
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:17,650
We're done. I'm done.

1490
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:22,604
I lose, you win.
You're a great thief.

1491
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:25,449
I got nothing left.

1492
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:31,844
I got no money, I got no time,
I got no job, I got no chance.

1493
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:42,285
I've got these weird pants on,
out in the middle of nowhere.

1494
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:46,885
How did we get here anyway?

1495
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:49,725
I carried you.

1496
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:50,801
You what?

1497
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:54,041
I carried you.
It's not a big deal.

1498
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:56,727
You were unconscious.

1499
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,291
We were like, a half mile
from the main road.

1500
01:17:58,480 --> 01:17:59,527
Jesus Christ.

1501
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,570
So, I just I scooped you up
and flagged down a truck

1502
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:05,371
and he gave us a ride here,
dropped us off.

1503
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,526
You carried me a half mile.
That's, uh...

1504
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:12,445
Probably not even that far.

1505
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:15,046
You get these shoes the same
place you got the pants?

1506
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:17,646
No. Yeah.

1507
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,440
The clerk said an EMT took
them off a dead hobo, so...

1508
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,047
Come on.

1509
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:23,360
He's not going
to need them back, so...

1510
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:25,483
A guy died in these?

1511
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:26,687
Because you needed shoes.

1512
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,211
What is the matter with you?

1513
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:31,924
My socks, though...

1514
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:33,525
They're your socks,
they're not dead guy socks.

1515
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:35,921
I've got money in here. I've got money.
I got sock money.

1516
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,001
We don't have...

1517
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:39,730
What the hell?
Hey.

1518
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:42,565
Why are we living like animals if
you've got money in your socks?

1519
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:45,001
I've got $300 and I need to
be in Denver by Tuesday.

1520
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:47,527
You can get a pretty cheap car
over there at Andrew's.

1521
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:49,569
Tell him Carl sent you.
He's a good man, Andrew.

1522
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:51,006
He was with my
sister for a bit.

1523
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:52,167
Oh, yeah?

1524
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:56,682
You got a beautiful yard here, Andrew.
Here's 200 of the finest.

1525
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:58,285
Keys? Thank you.

1526
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:00,807
Ooh! And it's got satellite.

1527
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:04,209
I'm glad we're not
buying that one. Jesus.

1528
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:28,930
Morning.

1529
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:30,886
Morning.

1530
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:34,324
I'm supposed to be
meeting some friends here.

1531
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:37,324
Was there a man and a lady
come through here?

1532
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:39,244
Both answer to the name Sandy.

1533
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:41,287
Well,

1534
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,089
we get tons of
people through here.

1535
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:50,844
Ahhh!
I've had a shitty day

1536
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:53,924
and you got a face that
looks like a dog's asshole.

1537
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,161
Were they here or not?

1538
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:57,641
They came through earlier.
I sent them to get a car.

1539
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:58,807
Where?

1540
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,211
Andrew's Auto Salvage.

1541
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:01,646
Write it down.

1542
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:11,290
I wasn't here.

1543
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:21,841
Thank you.

1544
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:25,689
Consider that a warning.
We need her more than you do.

1545
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:27,764
Better luck next time, old man.

1546
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:29,206
Fuck you.

1547
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:31,880
Shh!

1548
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,650
That's what I always
thought, but then I thought,

1549
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:49,006
"You know what?
I'm going to do it."

1550
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:50,889
"I'm going to wallpaper the
garage." And I found...

1551
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:53,088
First I thought, "Well, is
that going to be crazy?"

1552
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:54,611
But it's not really that crazy,

1553
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:56,523
because I found something
kind of thematically on point.

1554
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:58,762
You wouldn't rather just listen to this?
That's a good song.

1555
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:02,208
Oh, it is a good song. I like that.
It's got tires on it.

1556
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:05,364
It's wallpaper with tires,
which I thought was...

1557
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:06,441
Ow!

1558
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:08,170
You okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.

1559
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:11,369
I think it would be so cute.
It's red and...

1560
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:13,205
God damn it!

1561
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,249
It was one of those badgers. Oh.

1562
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:39,122
How great is the ride
on this Caprice, huh?

1563
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,044
You know this is
the last tank, right?

1564
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,724
This is not going
to get us to Denver.

1565
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:44,724
You know, I could help us out.

1566
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:47,445
How? Did you find
some sock money?

1567
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:51,167
No, I didn't find sock money. But
I've got my credit card burner.

1568
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:53,482
I can get a card, fill this
tank up in 15 minutes.

1569
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:56,291
I told you, this trip
will not turn me into you.

1570
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:58,442
I am not saying
that we have to go out

1571
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:00,443
and steal from orphans
and baby puppies.

1572
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:02,165
No one deserves
to get stolen from.

1573
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,084
I don't know why you don't get that.
Just drop it.

1574
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:06,322
I get it,
I just find it bizarre

1575
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:08,488
that you don't have
any kind of shit list.

1576
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:09,721
I find it pretty
hard to believe

1577
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:10,881
that you can't come
up with one person

1578
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:14,004
that deserves the wrath
of Sandy Patterson.

1579
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:20,370
My old boss, Harold Cornish,

1580
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:23,490
is a partner here at this
major financial institution.

1581
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:25,880
They have got a branch here in St.
Louis. Here is the plan.

1582
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:28,760
<i>We're gonna go inside, we're gonna
get his financial information</i>

1583
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:30,484
<i>for your little
credit card toy.</i>

1584
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:32,688
<i>Social Security numbers, bank
account numbers, routing numbers,</i>

1585
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:35,326
<i>it's all stored on hard copies
in there, in the Record</i> Room.

1586
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:36,845
<i>We just need a little
code to get in there.</i>

1587
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,082
<i>Yeah, but we can't get in
there with you looking like that.</i>

1588
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:41,811
<i>That's a great point.
There is a way around that.</i>

1589
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:44,082
Oh!

1590
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:45,921
Are you okay?

1591
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:47,761
What is it? What is it?

1592
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:50,451
My fibromyalgia. Oh, God,
my leg is cramping up.

1593
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:51,851
What can I do? What can I do?
Oh, God. Rub it.

1594
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,081
Rub it?
Rub it! Rub it!

1595
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:54,286
Rub it! It's cramping.

1596
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,001
Oh!

1597
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:58,841
Up?

1598
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:01,161
Higher, higher, higher.

1599
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:02,361
Higher.
A little higher.

1600
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:03,601
Oh, God, it's in my glutes.

1601
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:09,966
Get in there!

1602
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:11,360
How is this helping you?

1603
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:14,171
On, God!

1604
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:20,489
God, get in there!
All right, get off me.

1605
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:21,607
Get off me.

1606
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:33,641
I thought it was gonna
be a couple of offices.

1607
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:35,325
No. Come on.

1608
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:38,401
Who is this guy?

1609
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:42,327
That's Accounts Processing. That's
the "me" of this branch. Come on.

1610
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:43,811
Oh. That shouldn't
be any problem.

1611
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:45,600
No offense, but just
keep your mouth shut.

1612
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:47,643
This will be over in a minute.

1613
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:50,451
Hi. Good morning.

1614
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:55,003
Tina... Van Westengarden.
How are you?

1615
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:58,288
I'm fine. Can I help you?

1616
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:02,007
I'm here with my boss, Harold Cornish.
We're in from Denver.

1617
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:03,730
Oh. I'm familiar
with the name.

1618
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:05,120
I'm sure you are.

1619
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:07,160
We're gonna need to get
into your Accounts Room.

1620
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:09,160
Do you have
an authorization letter?

1621
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:17,962
I'm gonna be
real honest with you.

1622
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:19,451
I fucked up.

1623
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:24,165
I just kind of completely blanked
on that authorization letter.

1624
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:27,324
He basically runs me 24-7.
He's...

1625
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:30,131
Cornish is... He's a handful.
I mean...

1626
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:32,169
Honestly, he's an asshole.

1627
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:35,241
And I'm just hoping that we can

1628
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:40,040
figure something out, and you
can do me a solid and...

1629
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,207
You know, I don't think you
want to see me shit-canned.

1630
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:45,881
On my birthday.

1631
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:49,845
'Cause I'm getting married.

1632
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,161
This weekend...

1633
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:55,045
'Cause I got pregnant.

1634
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:57,001
Just a sec.

1635
01:24:57,320 --> 01:24:59,846
Twins. And my cat died.

1636
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:01,041
How are we doing over there?

1637
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:02,810
We doing good?
You calling security?

1638
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:05,247
You better not be calling security.
Hang up the phone right now.

1639
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:06,487
I wasn't calling security.

1640
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:07,965
Yes, you were. Hang it up.

1641
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:09,645
Right now.

1642
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:13,281
I'm sorry, but you're not allowed
back there without authorization.

1643
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:15,290
I'm not... You're not allowed
back there without authorization.

1644
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:16,761
I can do whatever
the hell I want.

1645
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:19,402
I don't have to tell
you that we suspect

1646
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:20,970
that there are some
people at this branch

1647
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:22,680
that are doing some
very, very bad things.

1648
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:24,330
And I don't have to tell you
that I've been sent here

1649
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:27,643
to look very quietly
at some records.

1650
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:31,805
Mr. Cornish, I don't mean any
offense, but we have rules.

1651
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:33,610
I know you have rules.

1652
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:35,330
Like never backdate a 5590

1653
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:39,570
or don't stamp a 33-B transfer
without telling a client first.

1654
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:42,048
I bet you do that one
twice a month, don't you?

1655
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:45,163
Tanya, can you give
us a minute, please?

1656
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:47,482
It's Tina, but...

1657
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:49,165
See what I mean?
What did I say?

1658
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:50,600
Nothing. You said that.

1659
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:53,644
I have you at a disadvantage.

1660
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:56,127
You don't know me,
but I know you, Ken.

1661
01:25:56,280 --> 01:26:00,126
I know that you
make $49,395 a year.

1662
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:04,170
I know that you work very hard for
that wife and child right there.

1663
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:06,121
I know that you're
real good at your job,

1664
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:07,685
that you take care
of this company

1665
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:10,411
and you do things that
they'll never know about,

1666
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:11,686
that they'll never appreciate.

1667
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:13,569
So, you're very proud, right?

1668
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:15,480
But you're scared.

1669
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:18,048
You're scared because
you're dispensable.

1670
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:21,568
You're scared because you know
that, more than likely, one day,

1671
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:25,088
you're gonna be replaced by
somebody younger, somebody cheaper,

1672
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:26,327
maybe even by an app.

1673
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:28,161
But not me.

1674
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:31,131
I'll be fine, 'cause I'm
on a different level.

1675
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:37,284
So if I don't get into that room
today, I'll be okay. But not you.

1676
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:39,885
You're still
going to be scared.

1677
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:43,204
And that's not fair, is it?

1678
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:45,891
Here's what we can do, though.

1679
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:49,482
You can help me today and someday
I might be able to help you.

1680
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:52,250
But you're gonna have
to break the rules.

1681
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:54,881
9488.

1682
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:16,371
Got it.

1683
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:24,491
Let me see it.

1684
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:26,364
This is it. Right there.

1685
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:29,086
We got it.

1686
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:30,571
All right. That's what I need.

1687
01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:47,690
Shit.

1688
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:55,571
Got it.

1689
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:58,484
Got it.
Wow.

1690
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:16,765
Okay, great. Good job.

1691
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:19,366
Let's put this baby to use, get some
gasoline and hit the road again.

1692
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:21,927
Wait, wait, wait.
Hit the road? No, no.

1693
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:25,402
I am exhausted. I need to sleep
for at least a couple of hours.

1694
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:27,927
I need something to eat
that doesn't come out of a bag

1695
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:30,925
and I need to put at least some
of my parts into a shower.

1696
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,001
I bet you're a real mess.

1697
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:33,930
Do we get you
a Motel 6, or something?

1698
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:37,286
Motel 6? No, no, no.

1699
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:40,042
Mr. Cornish, we go
wherever we want.

1700
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:43,882
Come on. Let's go.

1701
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:53,201
I need a room, please.

1702
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:54,361
How about a suite?

1703
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:56,442
Thank you, Mr. Cornish.

1704
01:28:56,640 --> 01:28:57,766
Yes, hello.

1705
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:14,404
God, they're real. They're real.
Yeah.

1706
01:29:41,680 --> 01:29:44,331
Just get there!
Get there! Get there!

1707
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:50,001
I miss you.

1708
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:51,650
<i>I miss you, too, sweetheart.</i>

1709
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:53,922
We're just gonna
rest for a little bit,

1710
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,082
and then one last
haul to get home.

1711
01:29:56,280 --> 01:29:57,327
<i>Thank God.</i>

1712
01:29:57,480 --> 01:29:58,447
Have you talked to Daniel?

1713
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:01,205
Yeah, spoke to Daniel.
Everything's gonna be fine.

1714
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:04,046
Oh! This place has
a shopping arcade.

1715
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:06,329
Reservation's at 8:00, okay?

1716
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:07,686
And no jewelry.

1717
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,525
I'll get cash for tips.

1718
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:11,768
<i>Is that her?</i>
Yeah, that's her.

1719
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:13,844
Okay. Drive safely, will you?

1720
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,968
Okay. I'll see you soon.

1721
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:46,282
Oh, that's a nice match.

1722
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:48,329
Now, that is a nice match.

1723
01:30:56,120 --> 01:30:57,565
Oh, that's nice.

1724
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:03,564
No, dear. More is not more.

1725
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,723
Oh, that's better. Okay.

1726
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:11,526
She is the best.

1727
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:37,241
Um...

1728
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:40,444
Maybe you could help me.

1729
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:43,684
Oh, honey.

1730
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:45,806
We'll take care of you.

1731
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:47,211
I've done a lot of
the groundwork for you.

1732
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:48,327
Really!

1733
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:50,045
It's really more
of a touch-up.

1734
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:54,365
Okay.

1735
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:20,081
Diana.

1736
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:22,121
What?

1737
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:23,441
You look beautiful.

1738
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:25,241
It's just all...

1739
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:28,122
It's all tricks and stuff.

1740
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:31,441
Not tricks, that's you.

1741
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:34,606
I said no jewelry.

1742
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:36,566
Oh, God, were you serious?

1743
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:37,687
Yeah.

1744
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:39,644
Oh, God. You've gotta
work on your tone.

1745
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:41,649
It was my tone?
It's vague.

1746
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:45,967
It's not just the top, it's
the Lucite, too.

1747
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:47,207
This is great.

1748
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:49,522
I'd like to make a toast.
To you. Oh.

1749
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:51,603
I thought I was the enemy.

1750
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:56,450
You are, but I gotta admit,
you taught me something.

1751
01:32:57,160 --> 01:32:59,001
Well, you taught me a few things.
You taught me

1752
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:03,524
about getting what you want, and
you taught me about confidence.

1753
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:05,529
Maybe a little bit too much
about confidence.

1754
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:07,802
Did you see me with that
poor Ken Talbott today?

1755
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:09,325
Yeah, you were
pretty hard on him.

1756
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:10,401
I know.

1757
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:12,650
But people have been hard
on me my whole life,

1758
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:14,290
and I just don't want to feel
like the chump anymore.

1759
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:15,811
And you showed me that.

1760
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:17,325
Did I?
Yeah.

1761
01:33:17,480 --> 01:33:19,960
You also completely
messed up my life,

1762
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:21,405
but I guess it needed
a little messing up,

1763
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:22,920
needed a little bit
more Diana in it.

1764
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:24,166
Well.

1765
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:25,526
Or whatever your real name is.

1766
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:27,841
That is my real name.

1767
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:28,921
That's not. Come on.

1768
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:30,321
It is.
We're friends now.

1769
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:31,731
That's my name, I don't
know what to tell you.

1770
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:34,485
Will you tell me your real name?
Finally, please?

1771
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:36,761
What does it matter?

1772
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:38,086
Exactly. What does it matter?

1773
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:39,366
Fine, it's Marla.

1774
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:41,164
Why are you lying to me?
Just tell me your name.

1775
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:42,287
I don't wanna tell you.

1776
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:43,925
Don't get pissed off. I'm
not getting pissed off.

1777
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,331
Just drop it.

1778
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:47,403
This is weird. Why won't
you tell me your name?

1779
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:48,647
It can't be worse than Sandy.

1780
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:49,846
Because I don't know it.

1781
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,002
Come on.
I don't know it.

1782
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:53,401
You don't know it.

1783
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:54,851
I don't know it.

1784
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:57,080
Really?

1785
01:33:57,680 --> 01:34:00,889
What about your family? What
about Morganville, Wisconsin?

1786
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,601
Are you telling me
that was all bullshit?

1787
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:06,401
No. There's
a great little town.

1788
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:08,562
It's Morganville,
it's in Wisconsin.

1789
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:12,486
And there's a really nice little
police station in the center of town

1790
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:15,689
where people that don't want
their babies can leave them.

1791
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:18,845
So, what name is
it that you want?

1792
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:21,440
Because I had six of them by the
time I was through foster care.

1793
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:23,846
That's a...

1794
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:28,050
That's a tough
life road to go...

1795
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:31,568
I mean, no one who could have
helped you out maybe, early on,

1796
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:33,041
and put you down
a different path?

1797
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:34,201
No.

1798
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:37,571
No, there's been no one, ever,

1799
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:40,722
to put me down
a different path.

1800
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:42,881
To do anything for me.

1801
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:45,645
There's never been anybody.
It's just been me.

1802
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:48,961
So, I don't give
a shit about people,

1803
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:51,088
and people don't give a shit about me.
And that's just how it is.

1804
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:52,401
I give a shit about you.

1805
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:54,403
You don't give a shit about me.

1806
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:56,484
You just want me
to clean up my mess.

1807
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:58,085
You don't give a shit about me.

1808
01:34:58,240 --> 01:34:59,571
And I know it.

1809
01:35:00,640 --> 01:35:03,325
I have been on my own
all my life.

1810
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:06,766
Nobody even knows I'm here.
Nobody ever knows where I am.

1811
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:08,843
Because there is nobody.

1812
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:13,049
I got sick,
I took care of myself.

1813
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:14,929
I needed shit for school,
I got it.

1814
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:17,241
You're so stupid.

1815
01:35:17,320 --> 01:35:20,369
Do you think your
fucking fancy suit

1816
01:35:20,440 --> 01:35:22,886
and acting like an asshole is
gonna make your daughters happy?

1817
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:24,007
You think that's
what they want?

1818
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:27,004
They want some big man
treating people like shit?

1819
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:31,363
I would have done anything
to have somebody like you.

1820
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:34,931
Just to actually be there
and care about me.

1821
01:35:35,120 --> 01:35:37,122
Just to fucking be there.

1822
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:40,363
You're such an asshole,
you're trying to be more like me.

1823
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:42,284
Nice choice, Sandy.

1824
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:53,965
Nice, I'm never gonna be able
to duplicate this makeup.

1825
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:55,281
Here.

1826
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:56,805
I don't want it.
I don't want it.

1827
01:35:57,400 --> 01:35:58,481
I'm sorry.

1828
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:02,561
I'm sorry I gave you some
lame dumpster baby story.

1829
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:03,721
I was just lying.

1830
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:05,769
That's what I do, I lie.

1831
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:12,485
Mr. Cornish.

1832
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:16,324
You are a fraud, a thief,

1833
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:18,687
and an asshole,
whoever you are.

1834
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:20,524
You're both under arrest
for credit fraud.

1835
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:22,523
Stand up. Hands where
I can see them.

1836
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:25,121
- He didn't do anything. He's just trying to get me...
- Save it.

1837
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:26,920
Put your hands in front of you.

1838
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,843
Okay. Come on, let's go.

1839
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:02,201
It's them.

1840
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:16,043
See you around.

1841
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:28,681
Yeah.

1842
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:31,041
She got arrested.
What the hell do we do?

1843
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:36,521
<i>Follow her to the station, you
bail her out and you kill her.</i>

1844
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:39,687
Ahhh!

1845
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:40,761
Damn it!

1846
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:42,126
Burns, don't it?

1847
01:37:42,280 --> 01:37:44,089
You! What you do that for?

1848
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:46,011
You shot me first.

1849
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:49,170
I didn't shoot you.
This bitch shot you.

1850
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:51,121
Good point.

1851
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:56,970
You know what?
You're crazy!

1852
01:37:57,280 --> 01:38:00,966
Yep, diagnosis and everything.

1853
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:03,205
Let's go for a ride.

1854
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:06,930
Hey, man,
this is some bullshit.

1855
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:09,447
If you wanna kill me, you
could just kill me right now.

1856
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:11,080
Gotta get in this
motherfucking trunk.

1857
01:38:12,160 --> 01:38:14,561
I'm gonna get in this
motherfucking trunk for now.

1858
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:15,801
How did you find us?

1859
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:17,849
Same way you found them.

1860
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,571
Car had satellite radio,
tracked the GPS.

1861
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:24,485
What if we work together?
We split the cash.

1862
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:28,402
This ain't about
the money anymore.

1863
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:31,450
They wrecked my van,
this is personal.

1864
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:35,091
Around, please.

1865
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:13,931
Hey, you guys have got
a pretty sweet ride, here.

1866
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:16,242
What is this?
An '08 or '09 Crown Vic?

1867
01:39:17,320 --> 01:39:18,446
'08.

1868
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:21,365
Ah! '08.
All right, I thought so.

1869
01:39:22,120 --> 01:39:24,646
What is this, like
250 ponies under the hood?

1870
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:26,643
You can feel that, right?

1871
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:28,480
I need you to close your eyes.

1872
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:30,409
What?
And slide right.

1873
01:39:30,760 --> 01:39:32,444
What the fuck?

1874
01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:35,769
Hey! Pull over, pull over!

1875
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:37,801
Jesus Christ!

1876
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:45,921
Are you out of your mind?
This is a terrible idea.

1877
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:47,487
Hey! It's stuck.

1878
01:39:47,560 --> 01:39:48,971
Are you insane?
What are we doing?

1879
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:50,280
We're getting away.

1880
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:52,363
All units, we need backup!
We need backup!

1881
01:39:53,680 --> 01:39:56,160
Put down your weapon!
Get out of your vehicle!

1882
01:39:56,520 --> 01:39:58,841
We can't go this way.

1883
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,206
Shit.
What now, huh?

1884
01:40:07,880 --> 01:40:08,927
Shit.

1885
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:13,721
There.

1886
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,082
Diana. Hey.

1887
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:44,326
Diana.

1888
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,286
Diana!

1889
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:00,804
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go!

1890
01:41:01,680 --> 01:41:04,047
Get up, you fucking baby.

1891
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:10,090
Don't move!

1892
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:13,569
Keep your hands up.
Put them on the wheel.

1893
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:16,165
Get out.

1894
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:21,084
Slow down. I got
punched in the throat.

1895
01:41:21,240 --> 01:41:24,210
I got hit by a fucking car.
Did you see that?

1896
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:30,680
What have you got in the trunk?

1897
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,040
I don't know anything about
the people in the trunk.

1898
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:36,646
Let me see your hands.

1899
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:38,688
My hands? He shot me!

1900
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:39,966
They shot me first.

1901
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:41,280
We're all going downtown.

1902
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:43,848
For what? I'm in a trunk.

1903
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,843
How about you do your little
handcuff trick for me?

1904
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,843
Just wait till we
get back to the car.

1905
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,240
Oh, come on,
just take them off!

1906
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:51,528
Shut up and give me a minute.

1907
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:56,687
You should be dead.
You got hit by a car.

1908
01:41:56,880 --> 01:41:58,484
I mean, are you even human?

1909
01:41:58,640 --> 01:42:00,369
It just looked bad.

1910
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:02,124
It sure did.

1911
01:42:04,040 --> 01:42:05,041
You know, the...

1912
01:42:05,240 --> 01:42:08,005
Part of the trick is
to just relax your legs.

1913
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:09,764
Better chance of
catching a roll.

1914
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:12,491
I read it on wikiHow.

1915
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:16,008
You can make light of it, but
what you did saved my life.

1916
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:18,083
And thank you.

1917
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:21,449
You were only in that spot
because of me, so...

1918
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:24,084
Fair is fair.

1919
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:26,961
Shit.

1920
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:39,242
You know you were right.
I don't want to go to jail.

1921
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:43,850
Please help me out.

1922
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:45,961
I know.

1923
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:52,451
So, what, 900 miles to Denver?

1924
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:55,881
Yeah.

1925
01:42:57,440 --> 01:42:59,283
All right. Here we go, huh?

1926
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:01,246
You want to buckle up?

1927
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:03,169
You want to take
your tampon out?

1928
01:43:06,360 --> 01:43:08,203
Ready?
Yep, let's go.

1929
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:45,881
No, no, no, no.

1930
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:04,601
Hello?

1931
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:06,330
Dad!
Daddy!

1932
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:07,811
Hi.

1933
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:09,081
Mmm!

1934
01:44:12,360 --> 01:44:13,725
Hi.

1935
01:44:19,800 --> 01:44:20,926
Hmm.

1936
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:25,330
Diana, Trish, Jessie, Franny.

1937
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:27,841
- Meet Diana.
- Hi.

1938
01:44:28,280 --> 01:44:29,361
Oh.

1939
01:44:30,040 --> 01:44:31,041
Hi.

1940
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:32,811
Nice to meet you.

1941
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:34,371
Nice to meet you, too.

1942
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:37,285
Diana's gonna be staying
with us just for tonight,

1943
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:39,169
and I'm going to take her into
work with me in the morning.

1944
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:40,810
If that's okay.

1945
01:44:41,160 --> 01:44:43,322
It's kind of mandatory.

1946
01:44:57,640 --> 01:44:59,881
It's a lovely dinner,
Mrs. Patterson.

1947
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:01,041
Oh, thank you.

1948
01:45:04,840 --> 01:45:07,684
I like how you decorated and...

1949
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:09,569
Like, you put stuff on shelves.

1950
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,001
It's nice.

1951
01:45:11,440 --> 01:45:12,680
Thank you.

1952
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:24,722
You've got some
food on your face.

1953
01:45:25,480 --> 01:45:26,606
Where?

1954
01:45:26,680 --> 01:45:28,648
Up here, like, in this area.

1955
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:30,649
No, you have food on your face.

1956
01:45:30,840 --> 01:45:32,251
No, I don't have food
on my face. Where?

1957
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:33,401
There!

1958
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:35,330
- Here?
- No!

1959
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:38,204
I would know.
It's not over here.

1960
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:40,084
- That's my clean cheek.
- Now you have three places.

1961
01:45:40,240 --> 01:45:42,004
Here, here and here.

1962
01:45:42,160 --> 01:45:45,323
You guys are driving me crazy,
because nothing's here.

1963
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:47,241
Nothing's here.

1964
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:52,681
See?

1965
01:45:52,760 --> 01:45:54,205
Babe, babe, mease.

1966
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:56,445
Oh! That's a lot.

1967
01:46:04,360 --> 01:46:05,850
Would you like
some help with that?

1968
01:46:06,600 --> 01:46:08,921
That's okay.
I'm almost done.

1969
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:13,601
I, uh...

1970
01:46:14,280 --> 01:46:16,806
I know you're
probably wondering

1971
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:22,969
what happened on our whole
trip and the open road.

1972
01:46:23,120 --> 01:46:28,650
And I just wanted to put your mind
at ease that nothing happened

1973
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:31,326
between the two of us.

1974
01:46:32,920 --> 01:46:37,801
I put off a pretty intense
vibe, you know, sexually.

1975
01:46:38,240 --> 01:46:42,370
Not intentionally.
I just... Put out a musk.

1976
01:46:43,240 --> 01:46:45,004
I just want you to know that

1977
01:46:46,160 --> 01:46:49,243
I put it out there,
but he did not pick it up.

1978
01:46:51,240 --> 01:46:52,765
And, you know, there's...

1979
01:46:53,160 --> 01:46:55,128
It's surprising.
'Cause I...

1980
01:46:55,280 --> 01:46:58,329
I don't know if you've heard
of the Bermuda Triangle,

1981
01:46:59,280 --> 01:47:01,681
which is kind of in here.

1982
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:05,841
And it's... You know...

1983
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:09,689
Once you go in, it's real
hard to come back out.

1984
01:47:10,640 --> 01:47:11,687
You know?

1985
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:13,569
Because some people
don't want to.

1986
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:17,961
Some people just get lost
in there, emotionally.

1987
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:22,805
I just wanted you to know that
he was a perfect gentleman.

1988
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:27,323
And he did not lay a finger,

1989
01:47:27,960 --> 01:47:28,961
you know,

1990
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:31,607
on, or in, me.

1991
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:35,851
Okay.

1992
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:40,961
You know, I, uh...

1993
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:44,164
He really loves you.

1994
01:47:46,920 --> 01:47:48,445
Thank you.

1995
01:47:50,680 --> 01:47:52,170
Okay.

1996
01:48:09,480 --> 01:48:11,528
She'd go away for, like,

1997
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:13,731
10 years.

1998
01:48:14,680 --> 01:48:16,603
I mean, she's not a bad person.

1999
01:48:23,080 --> 01:48:25,890
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I'm such a chump.

2000
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:30,570
You're not a chump.

2001
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:35,129
If I didn't turn her in...

2002
01:48:35,720 --> 01:48:36,721
I mean...

2003
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:42,005
We'd survive.

2004
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:29,125
Diana.

2005
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:32,563
I'm going in alone.

2006
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,490
Where's Diana?

2007
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:44,483
She said she had to go.

2008
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:49,091
How long ago did she leave?

2009
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:52,410
After she did our hair
and our makeup.

2010
01:50:21,600 --> 01:50:23,284
Well, as a shareholder
of the fund...

2011
01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:26,521
Couldn't make it happen.

2012
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:31,203
And to be honest, it wouldn't
have happened anyway.

2013
01:50:32,520 --> 01:50:34,045
It just wasn't meant to be.

2014
01:50:34,680 --> 01:50:36,125
Patterson.

2015
01:50:52,640 --> 01:50:53,801
Hi.

2016
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:55,490
Hi, Sandy.
Okay.

2017
01:50:55,640 --> 01:50:56,687
What's going on?

2018
01:50:56,760 --> 01:50:59,401
That completes the statement process.
You've been read your rights.

2019
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:01,249
This officer's gonna
take you into custody.

2020
01:51:02,840 --> 01:51:04,490
Mr. Patterson.

2021
01:51:05,320 --> 01:51:07,322
You are no longer a focus
in this investigation.

2022
01:51:08,240 --> 01:51:11,289
And she took responsibility for
everything that happened in St. Louis.

2023
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:12,880
I'd be happy to
provide your employer

2024
01:51:12,920 --> 01:51:14,251
with a letter
making that clear.

2025
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:17,081
You got your good name back.

2026
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:19,684
Congratulations.
Thanks.

2027
01:51:21,680 --> 01:51:24,968
Could I have just one
second with her, please?

2028
01:51:26,160 --> 01:51:27,685
Sure. Let's go.

2029
01:51:29,200 --> 01:51:30,406
Thanks.

2030
01:51:32,840 --> 01:51:34,490
I don't understand.

2031
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:38,122
Well, if I pop out of these that
quickly, he'll get all emasculated.

2032
01:51:39,800 --> 01:51:41,404
And there was
a pretty good chance

2033
01:51:41,480 --> 01:51:44,051
that this thing was gonna
end with cops, right?

2034
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:47,365
I just didn't think
I'd still be here.

2035
01:51:48,120 --> 01:51:51,488
I just thought I'd take
advantage of a free ride,

2036
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:54,207
and when I felt
like it, skip out.

2037
01:51:56,800 --> 01:51:58,290
I just didn't do that.

2038
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:00,130
How come you snuck
away this morning?

2039
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:02,402
Because I knew you weren't
gonna turn me in.

2040
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:06,689
And this was the right thing.

2041
01:52:10,560 --> 01:52:11,891
I gotta go.

2042
01:52:12,840 --> 01:52:14,080
Thank you.

2043
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:17,443
I really loved our trip.

2044
01:52:32,920 --> 01:52:33,921
Congratulations.

2045
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,206
Thanks.

2046
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:38,127
This is you. Come on.

2047
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:47,729
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

2048
01:52:48,360 --> 01:52:53,127
<i>Happy birthday, dear Daddy</i>

2049
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:54,770
Come on, girls.

2050
01:52:54,920 --> 01:52:58,447
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

2051
01:52:58,520 --> 01:53:01,967
<i>Happy birthday to me</i>

2052
01:53:02,120 --> 01:53:03,610
Okay, big breath, big wish.

2053
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:05,170
Everybody together.
Close together.

2054
01:53:06,280 --> 01:53:08,521
Yay for Daddy!

2055
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:10,611
Does Mommy want one more?
Yes.

2056
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:13,644
Honey, honey, honey, please. Are
you kidding me? Mmm mmm mmm.

2057
01:53:13,800 --> 01:53:16,929
You know what? Actually,
we'll take this to go.

2058
01:53:17,080 --> 01:53:19,890
We gotta go. It's very late.
Let's go.

2059
01:53:20,120 --> 01:53:21,963
I can't believe
how beautiful she is.

2060
01:53:22,720 --> 01:53:25,451
I mean, to me, she still... She
really does look like a Diana.

2061
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:26,601
Let it go.

2062
01:53:27,080 --> 01:53:28,491
I'm letting it go, but...

2063
01:53:28,640 --> 01:53:30,324
Sorry.

2064
01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:31,561
Are you kidding me?

2065
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:33,449
You are pulling these
out of your pocket. No.

2066
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:36,171
I will shiv you in the yard. I
will shiv you in the yard, I will.

2067
01:53:36,640 --> 01:53:39,291
<i>All right,
visitation's over in five minutes.</i>

2068
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:40,646
All right, break it down
for us real quick.

2069
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:42,650
Okay. Here we go.

2070
01:53:43,080 --> 01:53:44,081
Math, A.

2071
01:53:44,160 --> 01:53:45,161
Typical.

2072
01:53:45,240 --> 01:53:46,571
Accounting, B.

2073
01:53:46,640 --> 01:53:47,721
Nice.

2074
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:49,126
And Econ?

2075
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:51,248
Well, you know.
What happened?

2076
01:53:51,400 --> 01:53:53,164
You guys have been studying
for weeks, haven't you?

2077
01:53:53,320 --> 01:53:54,970
I know, but I just got this.

2078
01:53:55,360 --> 01:53:56,486
Oh!

2079
01:53:57,320 --> 01:53:58,685
Nice going.

2080
01:53:58,840 --> 01:53:59,921
I know. I know.

2081
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:01,240
I'm putting this in the file.

2082
01:54:01,320 --> 01:54:04,802
Oh, come on, it's not like
somebody's gonna hire an ex-con.

2083
01:54:05,080 --> 01:54:07,811
I'm actually starting
a first step program,

2084
01:54:07,960 --> 01:54:09,371
and I have a few years
to figure it out.

2085
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:10,930
Three, with good behavior.

2086
01:54:11,080 --> 01:54:13,082
And how is that going,
by the way?

2087
01:54:13,200 --> 01:54:14,281
Great. Great.

2088
01:54:14,360 --> 01:54:15,441
Decent, you know.
Good.

2089
01:54:15,520 --> 01:54:18,888
Some of these dykes are still really
getting up into my sweet junk,

2090
01:54:18,960 --> 01:54:20,530
but I don't let them.

2091
01:54:20,680 --> 01:54:22,842
Girls, "sweet junk" is just...

2092
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:25,964
Dessert. She's having
a problem in the mess hall.

2093
01:54:26,040 --> 01:54:27,041
We should probably get going.

2094
01:54:27,120 --> 01:54:29,566
The lesson there,
if you listen,

2095
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:31,842
is that if you're in the woods,

2096
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:36,209
maybe a boyish female bear
with corn rows

2097
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:41,407
comes at you this way, meaning
this way, and you just deflect.

2098
01:54:42,160 --> 01:54:46,165
It is always nice to see
you, and we'll wait out...

2099
01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:47,401
Girls, let's get going.

2100
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:50,046
What are you gonna do? Not let
them in, right? Come here.

2101
01:54:50,200 --> 01:54:51,690
Bye, Diana.

2102
01:54:51,840 --> 01:54:53,569
Stay beautiful, okay?

2103
01:54:55,880 --> 01:54:57,006
Okay, I'll see you
in a couple months?

2104
01:54:57,240 --> 01:54:58,844
Okay. Love you.

2105
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:00,445
Love you, too.

2106
01:55:01,560 --> 01:55:02,891
I got you something.

2107
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:05,124
Ooh! I pulled some
strings with Reilly,

2108
01:55:05,280 --> 01:55:08,682
and we ran your fingerprints through
the Wisconsin state database,

2109
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:10,405
and we got that.

2110
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:17,686
My name.

2111
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:21,320
Dawn Budgie.

2112
01:55:23,240 --> 01:55:25,607
That's a terrible fucking name.

2113
01:55:26,240 --> 01:55:27,730
It's a really bad name.

2114
01:55:29,240 --> 01:55:32,449
It's not as great as I
was hoping, but it's you.

2115
01:55:33,080 --> 01:55:34,605
Thanks, Sandy.

2116
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:40,208
But I already know who I am.

2117
01:55:48,120 --> 01:55:49,929
Yep. Thanks.

2118
01:56:12,760 --> 01:56:14,603
Back in your cage, bitch.

2119
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:18,244
Shit!

2120
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:20,405
Budgie?

2121
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:25,126
Sorry.

2122
02:00:19,960 --> 02:00:21,689
<i>No, Sandy's a girl's name.</i>

2123
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:23,285
<i>It's not, it's unisex!</i>
