Somebody's protecting him.

549

Who has the power to do that?

550
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:29,721
Someone far beyond us here.

551
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:34,058
We better stay off
the street for now.

552
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,728
I wanna be
a Hunter-Warrior like you.

553
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:40,230
Alita, that's impossible.

554
00:41:40,232 --> 00:41:41,697
We could be a team.

555
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:43,532
Alita, this is dangerous,
dirty work.

556
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:45,335
- I know.
- No, you don't.

557

How is that
your choice to make?

558
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:48,737
It's out of the question.

559
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:50,605
I might need
a life-or-death situation

560
00:41:50,607 --> 00:41:51,907
to remember who I was.

561
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:54,043
Even if it's just
for a second.

562
00:41:54,045 --> 00:41:56,212
Alita, some things are
better left forgotten.

563
00:41:56,214 --> 00:41:59,148
I don't want blood
on these hands, too.

564
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:01,052
Then I'll find out
for myself.

I'll introduce you around.

00:43:36,248 --> 00:43:37,816
Who's the top player?

587
00:43:40,418 --> 00:43:41,416
Right now, I'd say Jashugan

588
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:43,585
has the best chance
of making Final Champion.

589
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:45,987
Camber's still off
in the left bogie.

What's Final Champion?

592
00:43:50,328 --> 00:43:53,061
It's the best thing
a Motorball player can win.

593
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:55,998
Every few years, they choose a
player that can't be beaten...

594
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,733

smooth is fast.

Do it once, do it right.

598
