If only they'd look closer

184
00:11:53,128 --> 00:11:56,298
Would they see a poor boy?

Oh, Prince Achmed.
You're not leaving so soon, are you?

Rajah was just playing with him.
Weren't you, Rajah?

204
00:13:01,321 --> 00:13:03,448
You were just playing
with that overdressed,

Oh, sure. People who tell you
where to go and how to dress.

- Really? How come?
- Why, you...

372
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:17,043

- Yeah, of course.

And does Abu
have anything else to say?

380

How may I be of service to you?

407
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,905
The guards just took a boy
from the market, on your orders.

408

Your father has charged me
with keeping peace in Agrabah.

Why, kidnapping the princess,
of course.

If you could just... Aah! That hurt!

413

I'll never see her again.

00:34:23,727 --> 00:34:25,020
No.

536
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:27,856
No!

537
00:34:33,153 --> 00:34:34,238
Jasmine?

538
00:34:37,032 --> 00:34:38,450
SULTAN: Oh, dearest.

539
00:34:39,326 --> 00:34:40,744
What's wrong?

540
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:42,162
(SNIFFLING)

541
00:34:42,204 --> 00:34:44,832
Jafar has

542
00:34:44,873 --> 00:34:47,459
done something terrible.

543
00:34:47,501 --> 00:34:50,254
There, there, my dear.

544
00:34:50,337 --> 00:34:52,464
We'll set it right.

545
00:34:52,506 --> 00:34:55,175
Now, tell me everything.

546
00:34:57,928 --> 00:34:59,138
Oh.

547
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,224
Aladdin. Wake up.

548
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:03,559
Aladdin.

549
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:06,979
Oh! My head.

550
00:35:10,107 --> 00:35:11,483
We're trapped.

551
00:35:11,525 --> 00:35:14,737
That two-faced son of a jackal!

552
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:15,946
(SNARLING)

553
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:20,367
Whoever he was,
he's long gone with that lamp.

554
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:21,785
Aha!

555
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:25,205
(CHUCKLING)
Why, you hairy little thief.

556
00:35:25,956 --> 00:35:29,209
Looks like such a beat-up,
worthless piece of junk.

557
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,712
Hey, I think there's
something written here,

558
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:34,590
but it's hard to make out.

559
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:49,229
Aaaaahhhhh!

560
00:35:49,563 --> 00:35:50,731
Oy!

561
00:35:51,273 --> 00:35:56,528
10,000 years will give you
such a crick in the neck.

562
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:58,030
Hang on a second.

563
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,741
Whoa! Whoa!

564
00:36:00,824 --> 00:36:03,243
Does it feel good to be outta there.

565
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,496
I'm telling you,
nice to be back, ladies and gentlemen.

566
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:07,498
Hi. Where you from?
What's your name?

567
00:36:07,581 --> 00:36:09,166
Uh... Uh, Aladdin.

568
00:36:09,249 --> 00:36:12,086
Aladdin. Hello, Aladdin.
Nice to have you on the show.

569
00:36:12,127 --> 00:36:14,338
Can we call you Al?
Or maybe just Din?

570
00:36:14,421 --> 00:36:18,592
How about Laddie? Sounds like,
"Here, boy. C'mon, laddie."

571
00:36:19,551 --> 00:36:21,887
I must have hit my head
harder than I thought.

572
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:24,807
Do you smoke? Mind if I do?
(GIGGLING)

573
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:27,518
Oh, sorry, Cheetah.
Hope I didn't singe the fur.

574
00:36:27,601 --> 00:36:30,187
Yo, Rugman. Haven't seen you
in a few millennia.

575
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:33,816
Give me some tassel. Yeah. Yo, yo.

576
00:36:33,899 --> 00:36:37,611
Say, you're a lot smaller
than my last master.

577
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,029
Either that or I'm gettin' bigger.

578
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:41,240
Look at me from the side.
Do I look different to you?

579
00:36:41,281 --> 00:36:44,243
Wait a minute. I'm your master?

580
00:36:44,284 --> 00:36:47,413
That's right. He can be taught.
What would you wish of me?

581
00:36:47,454 --> 00:36:49,623
The ever impressive,

582
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:52,960
the long contained,

583
00:36:53,001 --> 00:36:54,044
the often imitated,

584
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:56,130
but never duplicated...

585
00:36:56,213 --> 00:36:58,298
(ECHOING) Duplicated, duplicated...

586
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:02,219
Genie of the Lamp!

587
00:37:02,302 --> 00:37:04,054
Right here direct from the lamp,

588
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:06,724
right here
for your very much wish fulfillment.

589
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:07,975
Thank you.

590
00:37:08,183 --> 00:37:11,395
- Whoa. Wish fulfillment?
- Three wishes, to be exact.

591
00:37:11,478 --> 00:37:14,314
And ixnay on the wishing
for more wishes.

592
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:17,109
That's it. Three. Uno, dos, tres.

593
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:19,486
No substitutions, exchanges or refunds.

594
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,821
Now I know I'm dreaming.

595
00:37:21,196 --> 00:37:24,783
Master, I don't think you quite realize
what you've got here.

596
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:30,038
So why don't you just ruminate
whilst I illuminate the possibilities.

597
00:37:31,331 --> 00:37:34,001
(SINGING)
Well Ali Baba had them 40 thieves

598
00:37:34,084 --> 00:37:35,836
Scheherazade had a thousand tales

599
00:37:36,336 --> 00:37:38,672
But, master, you're in luck
'Cause up your sleeves

600
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:41,049
You got a brand of magic never fails

601
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:43,635
You got some power
In your corner now

602
00:37:43,677 --> 00:37:45,971
Some heavy ammunition in your camp

603
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:48,474
You got some punch, pizzazz
Yahoo and how

604
00:37:48,515 --> 00:37:51,685
See, all you got to do
Is rub that lamp and I'll say

605
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:55,856
"Mr. Aladdin, sir
What will your pleasure be?"

606
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:58,317
Let me take your order
Jot it down

607
00:37:58,358 --> 00:38:00,319
You ain't never had a friend like me

608
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:05,657
Life is your restaurant
And I'm your maitre d'

609
00:38:05,699 --> 00:38:08,118
Come on, whisper what it is you want

610
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:10,245
You ain't never had a friend like me

611
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:12,998
Yes, sir
We pride ourselves on service

612
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,626
You're the boss, the king, the shah

613
00:38:15,709 --> 00:38:18,086
Say what you wish
It's yours, true dish

614
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:21,215
How 'bout a little more baklava?

615
00:38:21,256 --> 00:38:25,552
Have some of column A
Try all of column B

616
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:27,888
I'm in the mood to help you, dude

617
00:38:27,971 --> 00:38:30,307
You ain't never had a friend like me

618
00:38:31,975 --> 00:38:34,311
Oh, my

619
00:38:34,394 --> 00:38:36,730
No, no

620
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:38,065
My, my

621
00:38:38,148 --> 00:38:39,483
(SCATTING)

622
00:38:39,566 --> 00:38:41,985
Can your friends do this?

623
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:44,446
Can your friends do that?

624
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,907
Can your friends pull this

625
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:49,409
Out their little hat?

626
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,787
Can your friends go poof

627
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:54,206
Hey, looky here
Ha-ha!

628
00:38:54,414 --> 00:38:57,584
Can your friends go
"Abracadabra, let her rip"

629
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:59,753
And then make the sucker disappear?

630
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,422
So don't you sit there
Slack-jawed, buggy-eyed

631
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,591
I'm here to answer
All your midnight prayers

632
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:07,386
You got me bona fide certified

633
00:39:07,427 --> 00:39:09,429
You got a genie
For your charge d'affaires

634
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,807
I got a powerful urge to help you out

635
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:14,101
So what's your wish?
I really wanna know

636
00:39:14,184 --> 00:39:16,436
You got a list
That's three miles long, no doubt

637
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,523
All you got to do is rub like so

638
00:39:19,606 --> 00:39:23,735
Mr. Aladdin, sir
Have a wish or two or three

639
00:39:23,777 --> 00:39:26,280
I'm on the job, you big nabob

640
00:39:26,321 --> 00:39:28,365
You ain't never had a friend
Never had a friend

641
00:39:28,448 --> 00:39:30,951
You ain't never had a friend
Never had a friend

642
00:39:31,034 --> 00:39:35,289
You ain't never had a friend

643
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:38,584
Like me

644
00:39:38,792 --> 00:39:40,002
Ah-ha-ha!

645
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:43,297
- Wah-ha-ha!
- (GREEDY LAUGH)

646
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:46,133
You ain't never had a friend like me

647
00:39:46,216 --> 00:39:48,260
- (BUZZING)
(WEAK APPLAUSE)

648
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:51,096
(CHATTERING) Huh?

649
00:39:51,471 --> 00:39:53,515
- (GROANS)
- So, what'll it be, master?

650
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:57,895
You're gonna grant me
any three wishes I want, right?

651
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,146
Ah, almost.

652
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:02,357
There are a few provisos,
a couple of quid pro quos.

653
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:03,525
Like?

654
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:06,820
Ah, rule number one, I can't kill anybody.

655
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:08,238
So don't ask.

656
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:09,573
Rule number two.

657
00:40:09,656 --> 00:40:13,243
I can't make anybody
fall in love with anybody else.

658
00:40:13,827 --> 00:40:15,871
You little ponem there.

659
00:40:15,954 --> 00:40:20,542
Rule number three. I can't bring
people back from the dead.

660
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:23,420
It's not a pretty picture.
I don't like doing it.

661
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:26,131
Other than that, you got it.

662
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:27,674
- Hmm.
- Oh!

663
00:40:29,968 --> 00:40:33,055
Provisos? You mean limitations?

664
00:40:33,138 --> 00:40:36,183
On wishes? Some all-powerful genie.

665
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,102
Can't even bring people
back from the dead.

666
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:42,606
I don't know, Abu. He probably
can't even get us out of this cave.

667
00:40:42,689 --> 00:40:45,067
Looks like we're gonna have to
find a way out of here.

668
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:47,110
Excuse me?

669
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:49,988
Are you lookin' at me?
Did you rub my lamp?

670
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:53,033
Did you wake me up?
Did you bring me here?

671
00:40:53,158 --> 00:40:55,118
And all of sudden
you're walking out on me?

672
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:58,080
I don't think so, not right now.

673
00:40:58,163 --> 00:41:00,540
You're gettin' your wishes, so sit down!

674
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,876
- (ABU SCREECHES)
- In case of emergency,

675
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,504
the exits are here, here,
here, here, anywhere.

676
00:41:05,545 --> 00:41:07,881
Keep your hands and arms
inside the carpet.

677
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,883
We're...

678
00:41:11,009 --> 00:41:13,387
Outta here!

679
00:41:14,888 --> 00:41:17,557
SULTAN: Jafar, this is an outrage.

680
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:20,477
If it weren't for all your years
of loyal service...

681
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,940
From now on, you are to discuss
sentencing of prisoners with me,

682
00:41:25,023 --> 00:41:27,526
before they are beheaded.

683
00:41:27,567 --> 00:41:30,529
I assure you, Your Highness,
it won't happen again.

684
00:41:30,612 --> 00:41:31,989
Jasmine...

685
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:36,910
Jafar. Let's put this whole
messy business behind us.

686
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:38,078
Please.

687
00:41:38,161 --> 00:41:42,749
My most abject and humblest apologies
to you as well, Princess.

688
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:45,711
At least some good will come
of my being forced to marry.

689
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:50,048
When I am queen,
I will have the power to get rid of you.

690
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,717
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

691
00:41:51,758 --> 00:41:54,094
There, now. That's nice.
All settled, then.

692
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:58,265
Now, Jasmine, getting back
to this suitor business... Jasmine?

693
00:41:58,932 --> 00:42:00,267
Jasmine!

694
00:42:00,934 --> 00:42:02,185
(GROWLS)

695
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:05,564
If only I had gotten that lamp.

696
00:42:05,605 --> 00:42:08,734
<i>"1 will have the power to get rid of you"</i>

697
00:42:08,942 --> 00:42:12,404
(GROWLING)
To think we got to keep kissing up

698
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:16,158
to that chump and his chump daughter

699
00:42:16,241 --> 00:42:18,744
- for the rest of our lives...
- No, Iago.

700
00:42:18,785 --> 00:42:22,622
Only until she finds a chump husband.

701
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,499
Then she'll have us banished.

702
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:27,169
Or beheaded.

703
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,795
BOTH: Eww!

704
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:32,257
Oh. Wait a minute. Jafar.

705
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:35,177
What if you were the chump husband?

706
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,470
What?

707
00:42:36,511 --> 00:42:39,806
Okay, you marry the princess, all right?

708
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:43,393
And, uh, then you become the sultan.

709
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:44,478
Oh.

710
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:47,814
Marry the shrew.

711
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:49,733
I become the sultan.

712
00:42:49,816 --> 00:42:53,653
- The idea has merit.
- Yes, merit. Yes.

713
00:42:53,737 --> 00:43:00,243
And then we drop papa-in-law
and the little woman off a cliff.

714
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:02,329
Yaaah!

715
00:43:02,412 --> 00:43:04,289
Kersplat!

716
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:05,665
(WICKED LAUGHTER)

717
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:09,252
I love the way
your foul little mind works.

718
00:43:09,544 --> 00:43:12,172
(BOTH LAUGH SINISTERLY)

719
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:22,182
Thank you for choosing Magic Carpet
for all your travel needs.

720
00:43:22,265 --> 00:43:25,894
Don't stand until the rug
has come to a complete stop.

721
00:43:25,977 --> 00:43:29,106
Thank you. Goodbye now.
Good-bye. Thank you.

722
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:33,318
Well, how about that,
Mr. Doubting Mustafa?

723
00:43:33,693 --> 00:43:38,323
Oh, you sure showed me.
Now, about my three wishes.

724
00:43:38,448 --> 00:43:40,534
Dost mine ears deceive me?

725
00:43:40,575 --> 00:43:43,703
Three? You are down by one, boy.

726
00:43:43,745 --> 00:43:47,582
Ah, no. I never actually wished
to get out of the cave.

727
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:49,376
You did that on your own.

728
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:53,713
Well, I feel sheepish.

729
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:57,008
All right, you bad boy,
but no more freebies.

730
00:43:57,092 --> 00:44:00,262
Fair deal. So, three wishes.

731
00:44:00,345 --> 00:44:02,472
I want them to be good.

732
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:04,224
What would you wish for?

733
00:44:04,349 --> 00:44:05,725
Me?

734
00:44:06,476 --> 00:44:08,603
No one's ever asked me that before.

735
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:11,982
Well, in my case... Ah, forget it.

736
00:44:12,065 --> 00:44:13,608
- What?
- No, I can't. I...

737
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:16,069
Come on. Tell me.

738
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:18,029
Freedom.

739
00:44:18,071 --> 00:44:19,156
You're a prisoner?

740
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:21,575
It's all part and parcel
of the whole genie gig.

741
00:44:21,658 --> 00:44:25,370
Phenomenal cosmic powers...

742
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:26,872
Itty bitty living space.

743
00:44:26,913 --> 00:44:29,082
Genie, that's terrible.

744
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:32,252
But, oh, to be free...

745
00:44:32,335 --> 00:44:34,254
Not have to go,
"Poof. What do you need?

746
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:36,798
"Poof. What do you need?
Poof. What do you need?"

747
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:38,800
To be my own master.

748
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:41,761
Such a thing would be greater
than all the magic

749
00:44:41,803 --> 00:44:45,098
and all the treasures in all the world.

750
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,516
But what am I talking about?

751
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,935
Let's get real here.
It's not gonna happen.

752
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:51,438
Genie, wake up and smell the hummus.

753
00:44:51,521 --> 00:44:52,772
Why not?

754
00:44:52,814 --> 00:44:56,693
The only way I get outta this
is if my master wishes me out.

755
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,362
So you can guess how often
that's happened.

756
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:01,031
I'll do it. I'll set you free.

757
00:45:01,114 --> 00:45:05,368
- Uh-huh, yeah, right.
- No, really, I promise.

758
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:07,037
After I make my first two wishes,

759
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,372
I'll use my third wish to set you free.

760
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:12,751
Well, here's hopin'. All right.

761
00:45:12,792 --> 00:45:14,961
Let's make some magic.

762
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:17,756
So how 'bout it?
What is it you want most?

763
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:21,885
Well, there's this girl.

764
00:45:21,968 --> 00:45:23,053
Wrong.

765
00:45:23,136 --> 00:45:25,847
I can't make anybody
fall in love, remember?

766
00:45:25,972 --> 00:45:30,352
Oh, but, Genie,
she's smart and fun and...

767
00:45:30,435 --> 00:45:32,395
- Pretty?
- Beautiful.

768
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:35,690
She's got these eyes that just...
And this hair. Wow.

769
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:37,943
And her smile... (SIGHS)

770
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,527
Ami.

771
00:45:40,111 --> 00:45:41,863
C'est l'amour.

772
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:43,990
But she's the princess.

773
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:46,451
To even have a chance, I'd have to be...

774
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:49,329
Hey, can you make me a prince?

775
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:50,830
Let's see here.

776
00:45:50,872 --> 00:45:53,667
Chicken a la king? Nope.

777
00:45:53,708 --> 00:45:56,920
Alaskan king crab.
Ow. I hate it when they do that.

778
00:45:57,003 --> 00:45:59,464
Caesar salad. Ah! Et tu, Brute? No.

779
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:02,384
Aha. "To make a prince."

780
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:05,303
Is that an official wish?
Say the magic words.

781
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:08,181
Genie, I wish for you
to make me a prince.

782
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:09,683
All right!

783
00:46:09,766 --> 00:46:11,017
Yo, yo! Woof! Woof!

784
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:15,188
First, that fez-and-vest combo
is much too third century.

785
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:17,190
These patches.
What are we trying to say, beggar?

786
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,526
No. Let's work with me here.

787
00:46:20,026 --> 00:46:22,696
Ooh. I like it. Muy macho.

788
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:26,032
Now, it still needs something.
What does it say to me?

789
00:46:26,157 --> 00:46:28,868
It says mode of transportation.

790
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:31,871
Excuse me, monkey boy.
Aqui. Over here.

791
00:46:31,913 --> 00:46:34,165
- Uh-oh.
- GENIE: Here he comes.

792
00:46:34,207 --> 00:46:37,127
What better way to make your
entrance on the streets of Agrabah

793
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:40,797
than riding
your very own, brand-new camel?

794
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,132
Watch out. They spit.

795
00:46:42,215 --> 00:46:44,217
Mmm. Not enough.

796
00:46:45,468 --> 00:46:48,972
Still not enough.
Let's see. What do you need?

797
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:51,558
Yes!

Sire, I've found a solution
to the problem with your daughter.

809
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:32,390
Awk. The problem with your daughter.

810
00:47:32,557 --> 00:47:34,267
Oh, really?

811
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:35,643
Right here.

"If the princess has not chosen
a husband by the appointed time,

"then the sultan shall choose for her."

814
00:47:43,276 --> 00:47:46,529
But Jasmine hated all those suitors.

815
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:48,615
How could I choose someone
she hates?

816
00:47:48,656 --> 00:47:51,034
Not to worry, my liege. There is more.

a suitable prince cannot be found..."

Why, that would be me.

824
00:48:12,138 --> 00:48:15,975
But I thought the law says
that only a prince can marry a princess.

825
00:48:16,017 --> 00:48:17,310
I'm quite sure that...

for desperate measures, my lord.

00:48:22,023 --> 00:48:24,609
Yes. Desperate measures.

00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:35,008
Splendid. Absolutely marvelous.

884
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:36,509
(CLEARS THROAT)

885
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:38,595
Your Majesty,

886
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:41,264
I have journeyed from afar
to seek your daughter's hand.

887
00:51:41,347 --> 00:51:43,099
Prince Ali Ababwa.

888
00:51:43,182 --> 00:51:46,269
Of course. I'm delighted to meet you.

889
00:51:46,352 --> 00:51:50,315
This is my royal vizier, Jafar.
He's delighted, too.

890
00:51:50,648 --> 00:51:52,317
Ecstatic.

891
00:51:52,358 --> 00:51:55,361
- I'm afraid, Prince Abubu...
- Ababwa.

892
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:56,613
Whatever.

893
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:59,782
You cannot just parade in here
uninvited and expect to...

894
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:03,202
By Allah,
this is quite a remarkable device.

895
00:52:03,369 --> 00:52:04,454
Ooh.

896
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:08,207
I don't suppose I might...

897
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:11,377
Why, certainly, Your Majesty.
Allow me.

898
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,715
Sire, I must advise against this.

899
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:18,760
Oh, button up, Jafar.
Learn to have a little fun.

900
00:52:18,843 --> 00:52:20,428
Ow, ow, ow.

901
00:52:21,804 --> 00:52:23,056
Ahh! Whoa!

902
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:24,891
Look out, here I come.

903
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:31,981
Just where did you say you were from?

904
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:36,861
Oh, much farther than
you've traveled, I'm sure.

905
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:39,197
- Try me.
- SULTAN: Look out, Polly.

906
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:42,909
Hey, watch it.

907
00:52:42,992 --> 00:52:45,036
Watch it with the dumb rug.

908
00:52:45,411 --> 00:52:46,913
Aah!

909
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:48,623
Whew!

910
00:52:55,254 --> 00:52:57,173
Out of the way. I'm coming in to land.

911
00:52:57,256 --> 00:52:59,092
Jafar, watch this.

912
00:52:59,133 --> 00:53:01,594
- Spectacular, Your Highness.
- That was lovely.

913
00:53:02,553 --> 00:53:06,391
Yes, I do seem to have a knack for it.

914
00:53:06,432 --> 00:53:08,851
This is a very impressive youth.

915
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:11,187
And a prince besides.

916
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:14,857
(WHISPERS) If we're lucky, you won't
have to marry Jasmine after all.

917
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:17,610
- I don't trust him, Sire.
- Nonsense.

918
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:22,323
One thing I pride myself on, Jafar,
I'm an excellent judge of character.

919
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:25,034
Oh, excellent judge. Yeah, sure. Not!

920
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:28,705
SULTAN: Jasmine will like this one.

921
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:30,957
And I'm pretty sure
I'll like Princess Jasmine.

922
00:53:30,998 --> 00:53:35,169
Your Highness, no.
I must intercede on Jasmine's behalf.

923
00:53:35,294 --> 00:53:37,505
This boy is no different from the others.

924
00:53:37,588 --> 00:53:40,299
What makes him think
he is worthy of the princess?

925
00:53:40,341 --> 00:53:43,636
Your Majesty, I am Prince Ali Ababwa.

926
00:53:43,678 --> 00:53:46,639
Just let her meet me.
I will win your daughter.

927
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:48,307
How dare you.

928
00:53:48,474 --> 00:53:52,186
All of you.
Standing around deciding my future?

929
00:53:52,311 --> 00:53:55,106
I am not a prize to be won.

930
00:53:55,648 --> 00:53:57,483
Oh, dear.

931
00:53:58,484 --> 00:54:02,905
Don't worry, Prince Ali.
Just give Jasmine time to cool down.

932
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:08,035
I think it's time to say good-bye
to Prince Abubu.

933
00:54:11,956 --> 00:54:13,833
ALADDIN: (SIGHS)
What am I gonna do?

934
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:16,252
Jasmine won't even let me talk to her.

935
00:54:16,335 --> 00:54:19,964
I should've known I couldn't pull off
this stupid prince wish.

936
00:54:20,923 --> 00:54:22,550
(GROWLING)

937
00:54:23,342 --> 00:54:25,136
So move.

938
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:27,597
Hey.

939
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:30,683
That's a good move.

940
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:33,102
I can't believe it. I'm losing to a rug.

941
00:54:34,103 --> 00:54:35,271
Genie, I need help.

942
00:54:35,354 --> 00:54:38,024
All right, Sparky, here's the deal.

943
00:54:38,107 --> 00:54:41,486
If you wanna court the little lady,
you got to be a straight shooter.

944
00:54:41,527 --> 00:54:43,988
- Do you got it?
- What?

945
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:46,491
(READING)

946
00:54:46,532 --> 00:54:47,784
No way.

947
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:52,205
If Jasmine found out I was really
some crummy street rat,

948
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:53,498
she'd laugh at me.

949
00:54:53,539 --> 00:54:56,042
A woman appreciates a man
who can make her laugh.

950
00:54:57,376 --> 00:55:01,714
Al, all joking aside,
you really ought to be yourself.

951
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:03,716
Hey, that's the last thing I wanna be.

952
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:05,885
Okay, I'm gonna go see her.

953
00:55:05,968 --> 00:55:10,181
I just...
I got to be smooth, cool, confident.

954
00:55:11,682 --> 00:55:13,351
How do I look?

955
00:55:14,435 --> 00:55:17,021
Like a prince.

956
00:55:25,738 --> 00:55:27,198
(SIGHS)

957
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:31,744
- ALADDIN: Princess Jasmine?
- (GROWLING)

958
00:55:32,995 --> 00:55:35,915
- Who's there?
- It's me, Prince Ali.

959
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:39,544
Ahem. Uh, Prince Ali Ababwa.

960
00:55:39,585 --> 00:55:41,212
I do not want to see you.

961
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:43,589
No, no, please, Princess.
Give me a chance.

962
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:46,425
- JASMINE: Just leave me alone.
- Down, kitty.

963
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:49,053
So, how's our little beau doing?

964
00:55:50,429 --> 00:55:52,890
- Good kitty, take off.
- (RAJAH GROWLING)

965
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:54,100
Down, kitty.

966
00:55:54,141 --> 00:55:55,560
Wait. Wait.

967
00:55:55,601 --> 00:55:57,770
Do I know you?

968
00:55:57,854 --> 00:56:00,189
Uh, no. No.

969
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:04,944
You remind me of someone
I met in the marketplace.

970
00:56:04,986 --> 00:56:07,405
The marketplace?

971
00:56:07,446 --> 00:56:09,782
I have servants who go
to the marketplace for me.

972
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:14,453
Why, I even have servants who go to
the marketplace for my servants,

973
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:16,122
so it couldn't have been me you met.

974
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:20,543
No. I guess not.

975
00:56:20,793 --> 00:56:23,504
GENIE: Enough about you, Casanova.
Talk about her.

976
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:26,299
She's smart, fun, the hair, the eyes.

977
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:27,884
Anything. Pick a feature.

978
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:30,887
Ahem. Uh, Princess Jasmine?
You're very...

979
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:32,680
Wonderful, magnificent, glorious,

980
00:56:32,763 --> 00:56:34,056
- punctual.
- Punctual.

981
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,308
- Punctual?
- Sorry.

982
00:56:35,433 --> 00:56:37,852
- Uh, beautiful.
- Nice recovery.

983
00:56:37,935 --> 00:56:38,936
Hmm.

984
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,646
I'm rich, too, you know.

985
00:56:41,397 --> 00:56:44,150
- Yeah.
- The daughter of a sultan.

986
00:56:44,483 --> 00:56:46,444
I know.

987
00:56:46,485 --> 00:56:49,447
A fine prize for any prince to marry.

988
00:56:50,489 --> 00:56:52,783
Uh, right. Right. A prince like me.

989
00:56:52,825 --> 00:56:54,410
Warning! Warning!

990
00:56:54,493 --> 00:56:56,621
Right. A prince like you.

991
00:56:57,330 --> 00:57:00,958
And every other stuffed shirt,
swaggering peacock I've met.

992
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,710
Mayday! Mayday!

993
00:57:04,086 --> 00:57:06,631
JASMINE: Just go jump off a balcony!

994
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:08,966
- What?
- Stop her. Stop her!

995
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:10,843
- Want me to sting her?
- Buzz off.

996
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:14,680
Okay, fine.
But remember, "bee" yourself.

997
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:16,515
- Yeah, right.
- What?

998
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:19,268
Uh... Uh, you're right.

999
00:57:20,519 --> 00:57:23,856
(SIGHS) You aren't just
some prize to be won.

1000
00:57:24,523 --> 00:57:26,651
You should be free
to make your own choice.

1001
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,611
I'll go now.

1002
00:57:28,694 --> 00:57:30,696
- No!
- What? What?

1003
00:57:31,113 --> 00:57:32,531
How...

1004
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:34,325
How are you doing that?

1005
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:37,286
- It's a magic carpet.
- It's lovely.

1006
00:57:38,579 --> 00:57:40,373
- (KISSES)
- You, uh...

1007
00:57:40,414 --> 00:57:43,209
You don't want to go for a ride, do you?

1008
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:46,212
We could get out of the palace,
see the world.

1009
00:57:46,253 --> 00:57:48,547
- Is it safe?
- Sure. Do you trust me?

1010
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:52,677
- What?
- Do you trust me?

1011
00:57:55,179 --> 00:57:56,514
Yes.

1012
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:15,574
(SINGING) I can show you the world

1013
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:20,037
Shining, shimmering, splendid

1014
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:21,747
Tell me, Princess

1015
00:58:21,872 --> 00:58:27,753
Now, when did you last
Let your heart decide

1016
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:31,757
I can open your eyes

1017
00:58:31,882 --> 00:58:35,219
Take you wonder by wonder

1018
00:58:35,594 --> 00:58:38,431
Over, sideways and under

1019
00:58:38,514 --> 00:58:42,059
On a magic carpet ride

1020
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:46,063
A whole new world

1021
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:49,692
A new fantastic point of view

1022
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:54,655
No one to tell us no
Or where to go

1023
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:57,408
Or say we're only dreaming

1024
00:58:57,450 --> 00:59:01,245
A whole new world

1025
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:05,332
A dazzling place
I never knew

1026
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:09,920
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear

1027
00:59:09,962 --> 00:59:14,175
That now I'm in
A whole new world with you

1028
00:59:14,258 --> 00:59:17,887
ALADDIN: Now I'm in
A whole new world with you

1029
00:59:17,970 --> 00:59:21,682
JASMINE: Unbelievable sights

1030
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:25,436
Indescribable feeling

1031
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:28,481
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling

1032
00:59:28,564 --> 00:59:31,650
Through an endless diamond sky

1033
00:59:31,817 --> 00:59:35,654
- A whole new world
- Don't you dare close your eyes

1034
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:39,533
- A hundred thousand things to see
- Hold your breath, it gets better

1035
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:43,829
I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far

1036
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:47,333
I can't go back to where I used to be

1037
00:59:47,374 --> 00:59:50,628
- A whole new world
- Every turn a surprise

1038
00:59:50,669 --> 00:59:54,673
- With new horizons to pursue
- Every moment red-letter

1039
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:59,303
BOTH: <i>I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare</i>

1040
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:06,060
Let me share
This whole new world with you

1041
01:00:06,143 --> 01:00:09,855
- A whole new world
- A whole new world

1042
01:00:09,897 --> 01:00:13,901
- That's where we'll be
- That's where we'll be

1043
01:00:13,984 --> 01:00:18,197
- A thrilling chase
- A wondrous place

1044
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:21,951
For you and me

1045
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:39,385
- It's all so magical.
- Yeah.

1046
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:44,181
It's a shame Abu had to miss this.

1047
01:00:44,348 --> 01:00:46,392
Nah. He hates fireworks.

1048
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:48,394
He doesn't like flying, either.

1049
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:52,523
Uh, that is, um... Oh, no.

1050
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:54,733
You are the boy from the market.
I knew it.

1051
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:57,194
- Why did you lie to me?
- Jasmine, I'm sorry.

1052
01:00:57,236 --> 01:00:58,988
- Did you think I was stupid?
- No.

1053
01:00:59,071 --> 01:01:00,990
- That I wouldn't figure it out?
- No.

1054

1398
01:21:24,796 --> 01:21:28,007
- Huh?
- You wanted to be a genie, you got it.

1399
01:21:28,091 --> 01:21:29,300
What?

1400
01:21:29,384 --> 01:21:31,511
And everything that goes with it.

1401
01:21:32,136 --> 01:21:35,348
- No! No!
- I'm gettin' out of here.

1402
01:21:35,431 --> 01:21:37,350
ALADDIN:
Phenomenal cosmic powers...

1403
01:21:37,433 --> 01:21:40,436
You're the genie. I don't want...

1404
01:21:40,478 --> 01:21:41,896
Itty bitty living space.

1405
01:21:42,313 --> 01:21:45,191
Al, you little genius, you.

1406
01:21:52,782 --> 01:21:54,659
- Ahh!
(MEOWS)

1407
01:22:00,206 --> 01:22:02,417
JAFAR: Get your blasted beak
out of my face.

1408
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:06,045
- IAGO: Oh, shut up, you moron.
- Don't tell me to shut up.

1409
01:22:06,129 --> 01:22:07,338
Allow me.

1410
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:11,384
Ten thousand years in a
Cave of Wonders ought to chill him out.

1411
01:22:11,509 --> 01:22:13,469
(IAGO YELLING INDISTINCTLY)

1412
01:22:13,511 --> 01:22:15,680
JAFAR: Shut up!

1413
01:22:21,602 --> 01:22:23,187
Jasmine...

1414
01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:26,566
I'm sorry I lied to you
about being a prince.

1415
01:22:27,066 --> 01:22:28,443
I know why you did.

1416
01:22:30,278 --> 01:22:35,158
Well, I guess this is good-bye?

1417
01:22:35,199 --> 01:22:38,202
Oh, that stupid law. This isn't fair.

1418
01:22:38,953 --> 01:22:40,455
I love you.

1419
01:22:41,289 --> 01:22:45,626
(SNIFFLES) Al, no problem.
You've still got one wish left.

1420
01:22:45,710 --> 01:22:47,712
Just say the word
and you're a prince again.

1421
01:22:47,879 --> 01:22:49,881
But, Genie, what about your freedom?

1422
01:22:50,047 --> 01:22:53,009
Hey, it's only an eternity of servitude.

1423
01:22:53,217 --> 01:22:55,178
This is love.

1424
01:22:55,219 --> 01:22:59,557
Al, you're not gonna find another girl
like her in a million years.

1425
01:22:59,682 --> 01:23:01,851
Believe me, I know. I've looked.

1426
01:23:03,227 --> 01:23:05,271
Jasmine, I do love you,

1427
01:23:05,354 --> 01:23:08,691
but I got to stop pretending
to be something I'm not.

1428
01:23:09,233 --> 01:23:10,985
I understand.

1429
01:23:13,779 --> 01:23:15,656
Genie, I wish for your freedom.

1430
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:18,493
One bona fide
prince pedigree coming up.

1431
01:23:18,576 --> 01:23:21,746
- What?
- Genie, you're free.

1432
01:23:42,683 --> 01:23:45,394
I'm free. I'm free.

1433
01:23:45,436 --> 01:23:47,772
Quick. Quick.
Wish for something outrageous.

1434
01:23:47,813 --> 01:23:50,107
<i>Say, " want the Nile"
Wish for the Nile. Try that.</i>

1435
01:23:50,191 --> 01:23:52,944
<i>- Uh, wish for the Nile.
- No way!</i>

1436
01:23:53,069 --> 01:23:54,612
(LAUGHING GLEEFULLY)

1437
01:23:54,654 --> 01:23:56,989
Oh, does that feel good! Oh!

1438
01:23:57,281 --> 01:24:00,618
I'm free! I'm free at last!

1439
01:24:00,701 --> 01:24:03,913
I'm hittin' the road.
I'm off to see the world. I'm...

1440
01:24:12,421 --> 01:24:14,465
Genie, I'm...

1441
01:24:14,507 --> 01:24:17,009
I'm gonna miss you.

1442
01:24:17,093 --> 01:24:19,303
Me, too, Al. (SNIFFLES)

1443
01:24:20,763 --> 01:24:22,765
No matter what anybody says,

1444
01:24:23,724 --> 01:24:26,310
you'll always be a prince to me.

1445
01:24:27,603 --> 01:24:28,646
That's right.

1446
01:24:28,729 --> 01:24:31,899
You've certainly proven your worth
as far as I'm concerned.

1447
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:35,486
It's that law that's the problem.

1448
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:38,781
- Father?
- Well, am I sultan or am I sultan?

1449
01:24:38,823 --> 01:24:40,491
From this day forth,

1450
01:24:40,533 --> 01:24:45,162
the princess shall marry
whomever she deems worthy.

1451
01:24:45,496 --> 01:24:47,999
Him. I choose...

1452
01:24:49,083 --> 01:24:51,836
I choose you, Aladdin.

1453
01:24:53,504 --> 01:24:55,339
Call me Al.

1454
01:24:56,382 --> 01:24:59,844
Oh, all of you, come over here.
Big group hug.

1455
01:24:59,885 --> 01:25:01,637
Group hug.

1456
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:03,264
Mind if I kiss the monkey?

1457
01:25:04,015 --> 01:25:05,224
Ooh, hairball.

1458
01:25:05,308 --> 01:25:07,852
Well, I can't do any more damage
around this Popsicle stand.

1459
01:25:07,935 --> 01:25:10,396
I'm outta here!

1460
01:25:10,479 --> 01:25:12,898
Bye-bye, you two crazy lovebirds!

1461
01:25:12,982 --> 01:25:15,693
Hey, Rugman, ciao. I'm history.

1462
01:25:15,735 --> 01:25:17,361
No, I'm mythology.

1463
01:25:17,445 --> 01:25:20,364
I don't care what ll am. I'm free!

1464
01:25:23,534 --> 01:25:26,037
(SINGING) A whole new world

1465
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:28,873
A whole new life

1466
01:25:28,914 --> 01:25:34,754
For you and me

1467
01:25:34,837 --> 01:25:38,507
A whole new world

1468
01:25:47,558 --> 01:25:49,518
(LAUGHING)

1469
01:25:51,395 --> 01:25:53,397
Made you look.
