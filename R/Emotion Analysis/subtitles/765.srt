1
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:46,129
- You bringing Micky in?
- Yeah, he's gonna come.

2
00:00:46,297 --> 00:00:47,964
He should be here as well.

3
00:00:48,132 --> 00:00:49,966
You think he'll answer questions?

4
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:52,135
They said it was
gonna be both of us here.

5
00:00:53,304 --> 00:00:57,140
- Am I looking right in the camera here?
- Just look at me, right here.

6
00:00:57,308 --> 00:01:00,852
All right. You don't want me to look
in the camera with the...

7
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,812
- Right over here.
...interviews?

8
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:07,650
I started boxing
when I was 12 years old,

9
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:10,153
and I'd lie and say I was 18,
or whatever it was.

10
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:12,238
You know, I had a different
name and everything.

11
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:13,573
I mean, I don't know how many fights...

12
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:17,118
I'd done a hundred, more than that,
before I turned professional.

13
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:20,163
- Go ahead and sit right there.
- Why we doing this?

14
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:22,415
- I don't wanna do this.
- You want to start again?

15
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:26,252
This is my younger brother.
I taught him everything he knows.

16
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,296
I'm still his trainer.
You know, we got different styles.

17
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:32,467
I'm fuckin' squirrelly as fuck.
I'm like... I'm not even there.

18
00:01:32,635 --> 00:01:34,052
You know, that's what Sugar Ray said.

19
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,638
I was the most tricky fighter
he'd ever come across.

20
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:40,016
In '78, I fought Sugar Ray Leonard.

21
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:42,435
I went toe-to-toe with him.
He couldn't get to me.

22
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,354
He couldn't get to me.

23
00:01:44,522 --> 00:01:47,190
They called me the pride...
the pride of Lowell.

24
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:49,943
Everybody still talks about it,
especially my brother.

25
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:51,903
His whole life he wanted
to do what I did, you know?

26
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:54,864
But we're very different fighters.

27
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,741
Micky's, you know,
he's a heavy hitter.

28
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,160
He's got... a thunderous,

29
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:02,330
I'm telling you,
thunderous left punch.

30
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:04,791
Micky, he gets you
and he takes a punishment,

31
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,293
I don't know why he does it,
till you're right fuckin' in there.

32
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,546
He likes getting on the inside,
I stay on the outside.

33
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,493
Come on.

34
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,413
Dicky.

35
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,587
Would you come on?

36
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:53,590
Will you stop?
You gotta help me finish this.

37
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:57,385
Come on!

38
00:02:57,553 --> 00:02:59,387
- And predictable as ever.
- All right.

39
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:00,722
- You don't need to be Columbo
- Here you go.

40
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,099
To see where this fight is headed.

41
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:07,270
Bam! Over right hand
puts Micky Ward down!

42
00:03:07,438 --> 00:03:10,773
HBO's making a movie
on me and my comeback!

43
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:16,529
And my brother is gonna beat
Saoul Mamby in Atlantic City next week!

44
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:20,450
The pride of Lowell is back!

45
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:24,370
Quacka!
Who wants some?!

46
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,623
Who wants some?!

47
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:49,229
Hey! I want a cut.

48
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:55,235
Are you good?
You guys having a good day?

49
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,196
How are ya?

50
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:03,868
Come on! What you got?
What you got going on?

51
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:06,829
Lou! Hey, Lou!

52
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:09,207
- How are you guys?
- Dicky.

53
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:14,879
Making my comeback.

54
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:19,008
Hey, naughty, naughty.
What's going on here?

55
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:24,597
Hey, Dicky, Micky!
Take my picture.

56
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,015
- Take a picture?
- Yeah.

57
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:37,026
- Hey!
- Hey, Louie!

58
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,195
HBO's making a movie on me!

59
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:41,781
What's going on? Hey, beautiful.

60
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,706
Did you tap that?

61
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,458
I can't remember. I got CRS:
I Can't Remember Shit!

62
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:56,504
Hey, Jerry Garcia!

63
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:58,840
Are you nuts?

64
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:01,718
How'd you get here?
You drive around?

65
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:05,138
Hey, Ray. Ray. I love you, Ray.

66
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:07,056
You're doing well.

67
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:21,738
You're walking. Get on it.

68
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,584
- We make a mistake?
- Nah, I mean, he'll be here.

69
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:37,170
You know, like I said,
sometimes he goes on his own schedule

70
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:39,881
but when he gets here, we work hard.
You know, nobody pushes me harder.

71
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:43,217
He's supposed to be
training you right now, right?

72
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:46,095
Why don't you just go talk to them,
my sisters? They'll talk your ear off.

73
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:47,305
You gotta pay them to shut up.

74
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:49,557
He can tell you
how Dicky was helping him.

75
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:51,934
Yeah, come on, Micky.

76
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:56,439
- O'Keefe!
- Hey, we don't know where Dicky is.

77
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,608
You know where he is.

78
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:19,379
What's that Keystone Kop
doing in there? Where's Dicky? Girls?

79
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,464
- I don't know.
- Did you see him, your brother?

80
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:23,633
- Not this morning?
- Look at Ma!

81
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:26,803
All dressed up for the movie, huh?

82
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,472
- Wow!
- Get outta the ring, O'Keefe.

83
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,516
My Dicky should be doing that, huh?

84
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,935
Your Dicky ain't here, Alice.

85
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:36,854
Micky's got an important fight
coming up and he's not training.

86
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:39,690
Don't. Just forget about him.

87
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:42,235
He's number two man.
He's not part of this, all right?

88
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:44,153
- He's not being handled right.
- You get me coming in all right?

89
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:45,488
You want me to do that again?

90
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:48,157
Get out of the ring, O'Keefe.
Dicky's the trainer.

91
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:51,327
- I'm doing a favor, Alice.
- I will show you over here

92
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:54,747
these scrapbooks
I've been collecting for years.

93
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,583
Micky used to follow
his big brother everywhere.

94
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,293
Taught ya everything, didn't he, honey?

95
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:03,756
In '78, we got the offer
to fight Sugar Ray Leonard.

96
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,967
Oh, my God, it was...
Have you seen that video?

97
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:08,261
Oh, you're from HBO.
You gotta see it again. Come on.

98
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:09,762
Art, Art, where's the video at?

99
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:19,856
Tonight, my son is gonna surprise
everybody and beat Sugar Ray Leonard.

100
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,191
Believe me, I know it.

101
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:26,195
Sugar Ray might have
some trouble tonight.

102
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:29,657
That's a good possibility.
He comes in here against a good boxer,

103
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:33,035
a young man who can punch,
and I would like to say at this time

104
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,496
that physically
they're just about equal.

105
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:57,268
Leonard is down.
Let's see if that's a knockdown.

106
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:00,396
This is unbelievable.

107
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,567
Eklund just walked over him!

108
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:07,737
Nobody seems
to know what's happening!

109
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:16,787
Dicky did it.
Yeah. Tricky Dicky did it.

110
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,541
- Dicky did it.
- Weren't you supposed to be

111
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,710
training Micky right now?

112
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:26,380
- No, it ain't till 9:00.
- Dicky, it's fucking 11:45!

113
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:29,050
- It's 11:45, Dick.
- What?!

114
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:31,719
Where'd you fuckin'
park the car, Boo Boo?!

115
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:33,429
I didn't park it. You did.

116
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:35,431
- I didn't park it.
- Check your pockets for the keys.

117
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,934
- You got the keys, yeah?
- I didn't park it, man.

118
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,853
- Down there? I don't know.
- Check your pockets, all right?

119
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,772
- You're fuckin' mental.
- Fuck it!

120
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,024
I'll run. I need the fuckin' roadwork.

121
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:50,279
- Roadwork? Are you crazy?
- He's a great runner.

122
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:17,473
Hey.

123
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:18,683
Hey!

124
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,602
Quacka!

125
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:25,314
- Hey, Dicky.
- Better late than never.

126
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:28,484
Oh, look! Detective's on the scene.

127
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:34,031
Gonna get to the bottom of this.

128
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:38,286
- Figure this one out, huh?
- Dick, you're an asshole.

129
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:39,912
Hold it, hold it.
Let me get this straight.

130
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,499
You guys are working in the same corner
as Micky, together, right?

131
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:46,460
Yeah. Yeah, they're both in my corner,
and this is what goes on.

132
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:47,878
OK.

133
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:49,839
Don't you have
a job to go to or something?

134
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:52,675
Really, O'Keefe has a job
that he should be at.

135
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:54,969
Yeah, Sergeant
O'Keefe's working overtime here.

136
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:59,515
So we got Saoul Mamby,
Jewish, black, former world champ.

137
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,517
I think we got all the bases covered.

138
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:06,063
And my kid brother,
he's lost three fights in a row.

139
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,024
You know, he can't get used
to losing. It's a mental thing.

140
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,443
But we're gonna break
that with Mamby, right?

141
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:11,944
Yeah, I hope, if we can train...

142
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,697
We can train, right. Enough of you
wasting time, Mick. You know?

143
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:16,282
- Wasting time?
- Half the fuckin' day's gone!

144
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,409
- We got work to do.
- Yeah, half the day's gone,

145
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:20,161
- and I been waiting here for you.
- You wanna win?

146
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,631
Jab, two, three, four.
Left, right, punch right. Jab...

147
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:36,052
And again! One, two, three, four...

148
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:39,221
One, two, three, four, five...
Jab, jab...

149
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:42,391
There you go! There you go!

150
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,735
Come on, move!
Might as well drop the weight,

151
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:54,528
we're gonna out-box Mamby.

152
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:57,782
- Take it out on the mitts.
- Head, body, head.

153
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,367
That's your fuckin' combo.
Head, body, head.

154
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:01,911
Head, body, head, body.
My Dicky taught him that.

155
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,747
You know,
Sugar Ray's gonna be there,

156
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:07,541
calling the fight for ESPN.

157
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:10,920
I ain't seen him
since I knocked him down.

158
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:13,172
Like 14 years ago or somethin'. Right?

159
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:15,591
Hook!

160
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,802
Let's get
a real sparring going on here.

161
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:19,428
Don't wanna embarrass yourself.

162
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,681
Don't wanna embarrass yourself
in front of Sugar Ray, do you, Mick?

163
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,558
- You got him...
- Come on. Head, body, head!

164
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:25,851
Fuck.

165
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:29,605
- Fuckin' yeah. That's your punch, Mick.
- Oh, my God.

166
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:31,357
That's your punch.

167
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:34,193
That's your liver punch.
It shuts the whole fuckin' body down.

168
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:37,738
George's fingers are so fuckin' fat,
he can't even dial the phone!

169
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:40,825
Hey, right there, Tar!

170
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:43,411
That's not helping, George!

171
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,705
- Hold on. Wait a minute. I'm confused.
- What?

172
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,707
- Yeah, I'm confused, too.
- We're confused.

173
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:50,292
- George is whose father?
- You're confused?

174
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:55,214
- Dick Eklund Sr. Is Dicky's...
- Donna's, Gail's and Phyllis's father.

175
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,590
- Is Dick Eklund.
- Yeah.

176
00:11:56,758 --> 00:12:00,511
And even though Alice is an Eklund,
so is Cindy and Cathy,

177
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:03,723
- George is really their...
- And Micky...

178
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,850
- No. Micky and I are...
- Sherri Ward.

179
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,226
- We're Wards.
- The Wards.

180
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:11,480
It's not the way it sounds. Dick Eklund
and I were separated, right?

181
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:14,942
And then there was George,
just George. George is my man.

182
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:19,363
- Georgie's our poppa.
- After Dick, it was just George.

183
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:22,324
Charlene! Charlene!

184
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,746
Hey, Charlene!

185
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,665
- We're doing shots with Charlene!
- Yeah, you get over here.

186
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:33,002
- Come on! Come over here.
- Come on, drink yours.

187
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:36,839
On the count of three... Three!

188
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,720
Good job, fellas.
Oh, hey, one more time.

189
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:52,313
Why don't you just go talk to her?
She's a nice girl.

190
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,649
I told her all about you.

191
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:58,194
I don't wanna ask her
if she's gonna say no.

192
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:02,281
Can't beat that ass, can ya?

193
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:06,202
Get out of the booth.
Come on. Come on.

194
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:15,211
Are you just gonna stand there
and stare at my ass?

195
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:19,381
Your father stares at my ass,
but he talks to me.

196
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,592
Thinks you're the greatest.

197
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,178
- He didn't tell me you were mute.
- Keep the change, doll.

198
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:25,638
He told me you're
Kenny Fleming's sister.

199
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,473
- This is a tip?
- Yeah, that's my tip.

200
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,225
You know what the bell
says about this tip?

201
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:32,019
Cheap bastard. Cheap fucker.

202
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:33,938
Comes in here every day,
gives me shitty tips.

203
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:36,649
- Fuck that.
- Yeah, fuck you, too.

204
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:40,152
- Forget it, boys...
- You pave streets, right?

205
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,446
- Yeah, I do. And I'm a fighter.
- Oh, yeah,

206
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,073
I heard you were a stepping-stone.

207
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:49,537
- No, I'm no stepping-stone.
- You're the guy they use,

208
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:51,914
against the other fighters
to move the other fighters up.

209
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:54,083
I've had a few tough fights,
but that's not who I am.

210
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:56,585
The next fight's gonna show who I am.

211
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,838
Yeah, and he's
gonna lose that one, too.

212
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,590
Scotch and soda, Charlene.
And one for yourself.

213
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:04,677
So move that sugar ass
and get my...

214
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,762
You be nice. OK?

215
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,556
Be respectful.
Don't disrespect her.

216
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:11,392
Hey, don't hurt your hands.
We got a fight next week.

217
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,978
Besides, you wipe
your ass with that one.

218
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:16,063
Don't lean up, or I'm gonna hit you
in the cocksucker.

219
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:19,233
- He's gonna beat Saoul Mamby, say it!
- Yeah, he's gonna beat him!

220
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:22,444
Right? Right? Hey!

221
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,780
- Right.
- That's right!

222
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:26,448
I'm gonna take your drink, as well.
I'm taking his drink.

223
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:29,451
Hey, this guy's gonna be champion.
He's a great guy.

224
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:32,705
He's a great fighter. You can't
go wrong. Thanks for the drink.

225
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:35,291
Those cameras are makin'
a movie about him.

226
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,793
He knocked down
Sugar Ray Leonard on HBO,

227
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:39,587
that's why they're following him
around with the camera.

228
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,463
And now they're making
a movie about his comeback.

229
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:44,216
Yeah, everybody's talking about it.
But who are you fightin'?

230
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,052
- Saoul Mamby.
- Saoul Mamby?

231
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,264
- What kind of name is that?
- Black and Jewish.

232
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:52,474
Where did they find a guy like that?

233
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,476
He's no joke. Former world champ.

234
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,937
- Former champ?
- Yeah.

235
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:58,981
- I match up good with him though.
- Yeah?

236
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:00,816
- Yeah.
- What does that mean?

237
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:03,903
Well, I got lighter, you know?
I have a reputation for brawlin',

238
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,655
but I'm not gonna brawl with him.
I'm gonna try and out-box him.

239
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,449
- And there's a difference?
- Yeah, you know.

240
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:10,784
Brawlin', you slug it out.
I hit you, you hit me.

241
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:14,204
Boxing's a chess game, you know?
I pick my punches to take him down.

242
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:16,916
And go head, body, head, body.

243
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:20,920
- What is "head, body, head, body"?
- Well, I hit him in the head,

244
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,380
and then his hand's gonna go up
to protect himself,

245
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,466
so it opens up his body,
and then when I hit him in the body,

246
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:27,885
the hand goes back down,
I go back up to the head,

247
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:30,012
hand goes back up, hit him in the body.

248
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,640
People who don't know fighting
think you can do a lot of damage

249
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:36,602
hitting somebody in the head,
but you do more hitting 'em in the body.

250
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,355
So what do you think?
Can I take you out?

251
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,609
Are you married?

252
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,611
No. Would I ask you out
if I was married?

253
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,863
- What kind of guy do you think I am?
- Happens all the time. Trust me.

254
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,698
I'm not like that.

255
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:52,785
I'm not married. I got a daughter.
I see her every other weekend.

256
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:55,287
Her name's Kasie. But that's it.

257
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,665
Come on. Let me take you out.

258
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,168
When?

259
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:03,671
Saturday night.
I get back from Atlantic City.

260
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,565
- Is this the real number?
- You have to call it and see.

261
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:27,152
I will. Saturday. Dinner and a movie.

262
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:51,468
- Hey. Jimmy.
- Micky, hey. How's it going?

263
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,762
I don't think Laurie's
expecting you right now.

264
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,766
What's he doin' here?
This isn't your visitation day, Micky.

265
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,102
Look, I just want to say hi to Kasie.

266
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,770
It's not your day. Good-bye.

267
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,856
Yeah, but I'm not
around next weekend.

268
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:08,277
- You ditchin' the days you do have?
- No, I have a fight. I told you that.

269
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:13,073
- Jimmy...
- I can't get in the middle.

270
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:16,326
I can't talk to her, OK?
So I'm asking you, Jimmy.

271
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:18,704
I want to talk to my daughter. Now.

272
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:21,290
- Talk to your father.
- Goddamn it, Jimmy.

273
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,292
Daddy's gonna fight Saoul Mamby.

274
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,294
That's right. I want
to tell you that after I win,

275
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:28,422
I'm gonna start making good money,
and I'll move into a bigger apartment

276
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,799
like we talked about
so you can live with me more days, OK?

277
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,801
- Yeah, bigger apartment!
- Wish me luck, all right?

278
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:36,388
Don't hold your breath, Kasie.
It's cruel to mislead your child, Micky.

279
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:37,973
Good luck, Daddy.

280
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:41,477
Thanks, Kasie.
I love you, honey. Bye, baby.

281
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:44,146
Where is he?

282
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:47,274
Jesus Christ.
Un-fucking-believable.

283
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,618
- Quit worrying, for crying out loud.
- Blow that shit in my face.

284
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:01,997
You know, it's none of my business.
I go to a lot of meetings,

285
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:05,000
and they have a saying,
"Let Go and Let God."

286
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:07,419
- You gotta let him go, Mick.
- He's taught me everything I know.

287
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:10,297
He's been in my corner.
I can't do it without him.

288
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:11,840
You're already doing it without him.

289
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:14,510
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

290
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:17,638
Look, you know where he is.
Why don't you just go get him?

291
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:20,849
- Can you get him?
- I'm not fuckin' going to get him.

292
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:24,895
Are we all gonna go over there in
the limo with Alice? We can't do that.

293
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,030
Dicky.

294
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:39,743
- Your mother's outside.
- What?

295
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,831
Dicky, your mother's outside!
She's down there!

296
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,711
I'm not here.

297
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:53,549
- Oh, no.
- What?

298
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:55,217
- I gotta go check...
- Dicky, no!

299
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:57,261
Don't, Dicky! Dicky!

300
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:58,637
- He's goin'...
- Dicky...

301
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,430
...better get out of here.
- Dicky, no!

302
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,725
Quacka, what the fuck are you doing?

303
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:06,061
You know we gotta go to the airport
now. We got a flight to catch.

304
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:08,730
You know how important
this fight is to me.

305
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,899
Hey, don't tell Ma I'm here,
all right?

306
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,109
- She knows!
- No, no, no.

307
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:14,194
- Pick me up back at the house.
- Are you fucking...

308
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,405
- I'll go through the yards.
- She's in the driveway right now.

309
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:18,448
All right, but hurry up.
She's in the fuckin' driveway.

310
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:20,284
- We got a flight to catch.
- You son of a bitch.

311
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:22,911
You do this on the day your
brother's traveling?!

312
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:25,581
What are you doing?

313
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,457
- Why'd you make me do that?
- What the fuck you hit him for?

314
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:28,917
Why'd you make me do that to you?

315
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:30,294
- Jesus!
- Oh, my God, Dicky.

316
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:31,962
I was on my way! Ma...

317
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:35,299
- What are you doing in this place?
- There you go. There you go.

318
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:38,135
Why can't we just go to the fuckin'
airport for once, please?

319
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:41,054
- We got a plane to catch.
- Hey, Alice, what about your husband?

320
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:43,640
He's laying on the fuckin' ground.
You wanna help your husband?

321
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:46,518
What are you doing running in here
like a silverback fuckin' gorilla?

322
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,146
- We had to get him, for Chrissakes.
- Yeah, you got him all right.

323
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:50,772
You got him, pal.

324
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:12,169
You see Mamby?
You see how Mamby's arm comes up?

325
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:15,714
Leaves his side open, you just
light him up like a pinball machine.

326
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:19,301
He's gonna be pissin' blood.
No way you lose, Mick. No way.

327
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:20,969
- Hey, Lou.
- Dicky boy.

328
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:24,473
Hey, listen, what? ESPN can't
get us better rooms than this?

329
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:26,308
I wouldn't worry about
the rooms right now, Dicky.

330
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,727
- We got bigger headaches.
- Like what?

331
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:32,648
- Doctor won't let Mamby fight.
- Why not?

332
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:34,942
- He's got the flu.
- Mamby got the flu?

333
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:36,151
Yeah.

334
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:37,653
Micky, we can still have a fight.

335
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,572
- With who?
- Mike Mungin.

336
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,907
Mike who, Mungin?
Who's that?

337
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,909
Guy from Philly?
Isn't he in prison?

338
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:46,828
He's been out a few months. I've
called everybody, checked everywhere.

339
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:49,122
He's the only guy I could find.

340
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,917
My last few fights were rough, Lou.
This one's supposed to be easier.

341
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:54,169
I mean, we've been fuckin'
preparing for Mamby.

342
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:56,004
Yeah, but this guy
just came off the couch.

343
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:59,466
He's been sittin' on his ass.
Could be an easy win for Mick.

344
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,761
Joey Ferrell, remember him?
He knocked his ass out.

345
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,429
Micky knocked out Joey Ferrell.

346
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,682
Exactly.
And Mungin just got off the couch.

347
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:08,767
Can't make weight.
Might be a bit over, though.

348
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:12,020
- How over?
- Maybe 162, 165.

349
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:16,275
One-sixty-five?
Micky dropped weight. He's 146.

350
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:19,987
Lou, we prepared for Mamby. All right?
We prepared for Mamby.

351
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:23,115
This guyjust got off the couch.
Micky's in shape.

352
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:26,535
Roadwork, everything else.
This other guy, he hasn't done dick.

353
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:30,330
Don't forget, you don't fight,
nobody gets paid.

354
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,253
OK.

355
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:41,842
So, Lou... Come on, please.

356
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,928
Mick...
Joey Ferrell knocked him out.

357
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:46,513
Gonna be a hell of a fight, huh?

358
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:50,559
- I'm not doing this. 165 is big.
- You knocked out Joey Ferrell.

359
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:53,687
- So what? He's a middleweight.
- He just got off the couch.

360
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:56,315
He's got 20 pounds on me, Dicky.

361
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:59,234
Joey Ferrell knocked him out,
you knocked out Joey Ferrell.

362
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:01,945
- You just said that.
- Yeah, right. You can't be scared.

363
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:03,238
- Scared?
- Yeah.

364
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:05,699
- Why don't you go fuckin' fight him?
- I'll go fuckin' fight him. He's fat.

365
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:07,909
Good. Snap out the teeth.
This is your big comeback, right?

366
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:11,455
- That's what Alice wants.
- You knocked out Joey Ferrell.

367
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:14,833
All right. I knocked out Joey Ferrell,
OK? But the guy is a middleweight.

368
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:18,045
I'm a welterweight. They didn't have
a fuckin' heavyweight to throw in there?

369
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:20,756
Tell him, Dicky. He can do it, right?
He can do anything.

370
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:23,091
Oh, yeah, Alice. No problem.

371
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:25,594
You watch from the outside, pal.

372
00:22:25,762 --> 00:22:30,932
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mike "Machine Gun" Mungin!

373
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:34,978
Holy shit.

374
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:37,439
Hey, hey, look.
That's Sugar Ray Leonard.

375
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:39,274
Hey, Ray. Ray, Ray, Ray.

376
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:42,027
- Hey, Ray! Sugar Ray! Over here!
- Dicky.

377
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:43,987
Come on, look at the size of that guy.

378
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:47,407
- Holy shit.
- Yeah, holy shit.

379
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:49,159
That guy's no welterweight.

380
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:53,038
All right, Mick. We'll have to run
the first few rounds, tire him out.

381
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:54,581
He did not just get off
the fuckin' couch.

382
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:56,625
If he did,
I'm gonna buy a couch like that.

383
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:58,960
I don't care who that guy is...

384
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:01,421
Look at me.
You're Micky Ward.

385
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:03,799
You're Micky Ward.

386
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:09,930
Micky Ward, fighting a last-minute
replacement from Philadelphia.

387
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:12,474
Ward, thrown around
by a much bigger man!

388
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:15,644
- Punches, smashing Ward back!
- Jab!

389
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:17,521
Now it's big Mike...

390
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:20,941
Ward goes down! Ward goes down!

391
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:24,027
- Come on! Come on!
...four, five...

392
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:26,571
...six...

393
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:29,116
Micky Ward's a fuckin' bum!
Get rid of this dude!

394
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:30,450
- Shut up!
- Motherfucker!

395
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:34,329
Mungin didn't even
know he'd be fighting today.

396
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:36,289
Hey, you, back off!

397
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:41,002
Come on! No, no, no, Mick!

398
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:44,881
Ward, a respected fighter.

399
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:47,300
You hope this mismatch
doesn't hurt his confidence.

400
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:51,471
- You're a loser!
- You're a loser!

401
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:14,494
Ladies and gentlemen,

402
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:16,288
before we get started,
a lot of people have been asking

403
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:19,207
about the big night
of boxing on November 4.

404
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,626
Three world championship bouts...

405
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:24,713
Ray! Hey, Ray! Ray!

406
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:29,551
- Hey!
- Dicky. How you doin', man?

407
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:31,887
- How are ya?
- All right, man.

408
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:35,599
He's 165 pounds.
ESPN screwed us. You know?

409
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:38,935
- The guy was huge.
- Hey. You know, I...

410
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:41,062
I knocked Ray down.

411
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,898
I look like shit,
but I knocked Ray down.

412
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:45,400
Hey, let me buy
you guys a drink. All right?

413
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,569
- Want a cold one?
- No, no, no.

414
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:50,071
I got to leave. I got a plane to catch.
Next time, right?

415
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:53,116
Hey, Ray, wait, wait. HBO's makin'
a movie on me. You know?

416
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:55,744
Can I call ya?

417
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:59,581
I'm gonna get a fight, and I just like
ya to be there for old time's sakes.

418
00:24:59,749 --> 00:25:02,417
- You commentate or something.
- What's the movie about?

419
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:04,753
My comeback. Right?

420
00:25:04,921 --> 00:25:07,756
- Call me. Love you, brother.
- I'll call ya.

421
00:25:07,924 --> 00:25:09,424
You don't be a stranger!

422
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:12,177
He's funny,
"What's the movie about?"

423
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:13,553
What's that?

424
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:16,181
You can do better. You're too
good a boxer, I've watched you.

425
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:18,350
- Are you going to the hospital?
- What is that?

426
00:25:18,518 --> 00:25:22,270
- They said I need to get stitches.
- Mick, nobody's got heart like you.

427
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:25,357
You're a very talented fighter,
but you're not getting the right fights.

428
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:27,859
- It's killing your chances.
- What's he talking to Mike Toma for?

429
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,529
- I don't know, Dick.
- I want to give you a real shot.

430
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:34,241
I want you to come with me.
I want to pay you to train with my guys.

431
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:35,742
- Where?
- Las Vegas.

432
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:39,120
Do it right and make one last run
at this thing before it's too late.

433
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:40,789
What about my brother?

434
00:25:40,957 --> 00:25:43,416
With all due respect,
he's too much trouble.

435
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:46,670
You owe it to yourself
to come to Vegas.

436
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:49,339
Come on, Mick,
what has Dicky done for you?

437
00:25:49,507 --> 00:25:52,259
He got you into fights, he lets
you get beat, like you did tonight.

438
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:56,054
You shouldn't have been in that fight.
Eighteen pounds, think of it that way.

439
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:57,681
You should've given it up.

440
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:02,310
Sit down in the car there.
Come on, you.

441
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:05,313
- Sit the hell down.
- A little more Scotch for Mama.

442
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:07,941
There you go. Nice and easy.
Don't hurt yourself coming back.

443
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:10,986
- Will ya, ya old broad ya?
- Oh, my God.

444
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:14,364
Oh, my God, that Sugar Ray,
he's a beautiful man, isn't he?

445
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:15,865
He didn't recognize me
straight away.

446
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:17,867
You seen the way
he was looking at me?

447
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:21,121
He's a good guy.
I like him, I like him.

448
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:25,250
I seen him on ringside, he was
so happy seeing me and Mick together.

449
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:28,336
He's all about family, that guy.
Loves to see a family stick together.

450
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:32,173
Mick, what'd Mike Toma
want with you last night?

451
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:34,509
- He wants to train me in Vegas.
- What?

452
00:26:34,677 --> 00:26:36,845
You can't trust that guy, Micky.
He ain't family, you know?

453
00:26:37,013 --> 00:26:41,558
You don't know him. He say anything
about me? Did he say I could come?

454
00:26:41,726 --> 00:26:43,560
He didn't mention you.

455
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:48,189
What are you gonna do in Vegas
without your brother?

456
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:50,609
That guyjust wants to use you
like a piece of toilet paper.

457
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:53,153
What are you gonna do in Vegas
without Dicky? Without your family?

458
00:26:53,321 --> 00:26:56,031
- I know, that's what I told him.
- You told him that, right?

459
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:58,992
Yeah, I told him. I said that I needed
to be with my family in Lowell.

460
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,369
That's right.
Nothing wrong with that.

461
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:03,246
Sugar Ray said call him.
We're gonna call him, baby.

462
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:04,497
That's right.

463
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:06,708
You guys can spar a little, right?

464
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:08,877
Where are they?

465
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:10,879
- There's my champ!
- Daddy's home!

466
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:14,758
- Daddy's home! Daddy's home!
- Give him a big hug.

467
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:16,009
I love you!

468
00:27:16,886 --> 00:27:18,053
Thank you.

469
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,221
Your face hurting you, sweetheart?

470
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:24,559
No? 'Cause it's killing me.
Come on.

471
00:27:24,727 --> 00:27:25,894
Did Uncle Micky win the fight?

472
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:28,688
No, Micky didn't win this time.
Not this time.

473
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:32,359
Hey, Mick, you take care.
I'll call you tomorrow.

474
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:34,861
Cheer up. We'll get you another fight.

475
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:37,113
I don't know, Ma. I don't
think I wanna do this no more.

476
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:38,657
What don't you wanna do no more?

477
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:40,283
Just, I don't wanna do it anymore.

478
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:44,704
- What are you?
- Hey, Mick, ESPN screwed us.

479
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:49,250
All right? They owe us. We'll get
another fight. You'll heal up.

480
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:51,753
- It's gonna be OK.
- Yeah, listen to your brother.

481
00:27:51,921 --> 00:27:53,880
They owe us big-time, sweetheart.

482
00:27:54,048 --> 00:27:55,757
Maybe they'll even
do Dicky's comeback fight.

483
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:57,425
What do you think?

484
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:00,970
Oh, come on, cheer up. You take
a little soak when you get home,

485
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:03,306
have a day or two to think about it.
I'll find you a better fight.

486
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:05,141
A much better fight.
I'm gonna talk to them.

487
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:07,727
- For Chrissakes, Alice.
- What?

488
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:09,437
He's been through the ringer.
Leave him alone, will ya?

489
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:10,605
What are you talking about?

490
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:12,565
Let him get some time to himself.
He just got finished.

491
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:14,567
- What's your fuckin' problem?
- Come on.

492
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:16,820
Where's Micky?
Is Micky not gonna come in?

493
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:19,781
No, he's not coming in.
He needs to get back and get some rest.

494
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:22,409
Come on, let's go inside.

495
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:24,828
No. He's gonna go rest.
He's all grumpy.

496
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:27,455
He's beat up,
he's a little embarrassed, I think.

497
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:29,374
Look at him.
Have you even seen him?

498
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:29,058
Who is it?

499
00:29:49,914 --> 00:29:52,207
I saw the shade move.

500
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:54,125
Micky, the shade is still moving.

501
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:57,504
I saw you come to the window,
I know you're in there.

502
00:29:57,671 --> 00:30:00,507
Least you can do is open up
this door and tell me to my face

503
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:02,884
why you didn't call me yesterday.

504
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:10,099
Why'd you stand me up last night?

505
00:30:11,227 --> 00:30:14,479
I started to call. I was gonna call,
but... I just couldn't.

506
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:16,147
'Cause you lost the fight?

507
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,900
Maybe, yeah.
'Cause I lost the fight.

508
00:30:19,068 --> 00:30:20,819
How'd you know my house, anyway?

509
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:22,779
I asked my brother.

510
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:25,740
Your thing's coming off.

511
00:30:25,908 --> 00:30:27,784
I mean your other thing.

512
00:30:29,912 --> 00:30:31,579
You got any tape?

513
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:42,465
Did the black Jewish guy
do this to you?

514
00:30:42,633 --> 00:30:46,010
I didn't get to fight
the black Jewish guy.

515
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:49,848
You didn't get to go
head, body, head?

516
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:53,893
Saoul Mamby got the flu. Guy who
took his place had 20 pounds on me.

517
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:56,729
I never should've fought him.

518
00:30:56,897 --> 00:31:01,526
- Why did you?
- Nobody would've got paid.

519
00:31:01,694 --> 00:31:04,445
Everybody said I could've beat him.

520
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:06,948
Who's everybody?

521
00:31:07,116 --> 00:31:09,909
My mother, my brother.

522
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:15,623
So are you gonna take me
to dinner and a movie, or what?

523
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:45,570
- Hey.
- Hey.

524
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:50,033
- You look great.
- Thank you.

525
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,993
Got a nice house, too.

526
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:54,203
It's an apartment building.
There's five of 'em in there.

527
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:56,039
One of my old roommates lives in one.

528
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:57,582
Roommate?
What, were you in the Army?

529
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,834
- College.
- College. Wow.

530
00:32:00,002 --> 00:32:02,629
Yeah, a lot of good it did me.
I work in a bar.

531
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:05,673
Well, you seem to enjoy it.
You're very popular down there.

532
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:08,343
Yeah, popular.
I gotta get out of there.

533
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:11,054
If I don't drink while I'm working,
I'll fuckin' kill myself.

534
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:14,307
- What college?
- URI. Full boat.

535
00:32:14,475 --> 00:32:15,600
Full boat's a scholarship, right?

536
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:17,894
- Yeah.
- For what?

537
00:32:18,062 --> 00:32:21,356
- I was a high jumper.
- High jumper? You gotta be kidding me.

538
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:24,817
Fuck you. I was good. I was
New England champ. I cleared 5' 8".

539
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:27,862
- Wow.
- Never graduated. I partied too hard.

540
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,197
You?

541
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:46,547
What are we doing
in Richie Rich Lexington?

542
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:48,049
You come to this theater a lot?

543
00:32:48,217 --> 00:32:50,134
Yeah, it's a good theater.
They got good movies here.

544
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:53,304
- Yeah, like what?
- Belli Epi-que.

545
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:57,183
I think it's Belle Epic.
It's "epic." Belle Epic.

546
00:32:57,351 --> 00:33:00,436
Belle Epoque.
The New York Times loved it.

547
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:02,438
Well, I never heard of it.

548
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:04,691
Where'd you hear about it?
The New York Times?

549
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:07,068
No, a guy from work.

550
00:33:07,236 --> 00:33:09,070
And the cinematography
is supposed to be gorgeous.

551
00:33:09,238 --> 00:33:10,530
Oh, cool.

552
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:28,589
Thank you.

553
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:40,685
That's the movie you wanted to see?

554
00:33:40,853 --> 00:33:43,104
There wasn't even any good sex in it.

555
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:46,691
Had to read the whole fuckin' movie.
Fuckin' subtitled.

556
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:50,028
And some guy from a road crew
recommended it to you?

557
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:52,030
A fuckin' subtitled movie?

558
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:55,241
What's going on?

559
00:33:55,409 --> 00:33:58,453
What's going on? You got a girlfriend
or something? You hiding me from her?

560
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,122
I don't have a girlfriend, all right?

561
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:03,124
I... I like you.

562
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:07,003
I came here 'cause I don't
wanna show my face in Lowell.

563
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:09,589
I told everybody I was gonna win
that fight and get back on track.

564
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:12,300
I told my daughter I was gonna get
a bigger apartment so she can move in.

565
00:34:12,468 --> 00:34:14,260
You don't think I wanted to call you?

566
00:34:14,428 --> 00:34:19,724
I was embarrassed. I mean... I'm sick
of being a fuckin' disappointment. I...

567
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:26,981
You really think
your family's looking out for you?

568
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:32,153
Don't say that about my family.

569
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:36,199
What else can I say
after what you told me?

570
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:38,409
I mean, look at your face.

571
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,204
Look at you.

572
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:08,981
Bullshit, Lou. I'm not gonna
stop callin' till you make this right

573
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:11,484
and give us a fight that's fair.

574
00:35:11,652 --> 00:35:14,403
My boy could've got killed last time.

575
00:35:16,532 --> 00:35:18,157
Yeah, like what?

576
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:22,370
Just don't tell me he just
got off the fuckin' couch.

577
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,418
He's coming off a loss?

578
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:32,338
Sounds very interesting.
I'll get back to you.

579
00:35:32,506 --> 00:35:34,674
We got a great opportunity here.

580
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:37,093
We gotta go find Micky.

581
00:35:37,261 --> 00:35:40,054
Nobody's seen him
for like three weeks.

582
00:35:41,098 --> 00:35:42,390
Jesus.

583
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:45,977
Used to be Dicky we couldn't find,
now it's both of them?

584
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:48,187
Ma, I think he's
with that girl from the bar.

585
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:51,315
- What girl?
- It's that fuckin' girl, Charlene.

586
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:53,401
That's who he's with.
That girl from the bar.

587
00:35:53,569 --> 00:35:56,737
George was all fuckin' eager
for them to get together.

588
00:35:57,447 --> 00:35:59,031
I heard she's into three-ways.

589
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:01,993
- Yeah, with other girls.
- Yeah, like one of those MTV girls.

590
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:03,911
MTV...
What are you talking about?

591
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,246
Wild.

592
00:36:05,414 --> 00:36:08,499
She acts all fuckin' superior
'cause she went to college.

593
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:12,295
You girls just go
find your brother, Micky.

594
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:14,964
Tell him we've got important
business to discuss.

595
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:17,967
I've gotta go find Dicky.

596
00:36:26,894 --> 00:36:28,561
Dicky!

597
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:20,321
Hey, Ma, there's nothing
in there. I just...

598
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:24,825
It was just some friends I was seeing,
you know?

599
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:27,662
Don't worry about it, Ma.

600
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:35,378
I was just helping 'em out, you know?

601
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:37,964
Hey, Alice...

602
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:41,008
Alice...

603
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:44,929
I started a joke

604
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:50,017
Which started the whole world cryin'

605
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:54,313
Oh, if only I'd seen

606
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:58,192
That the joke was on me

607
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:02,029
I started to cry

608
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:07,493
Which started
the whole world laughin'

609
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:11,414
Oh, if only I'd seen

610
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:14,875
That the joke was on me

611
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:18,713
I looked at the skies

612
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:24,719
Runnin' my hands over my eyes

613
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:30,558
And I fell out of bed

614
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:33,102
Hurting my head...

615
00:38:49,578 --> 00:38:52,621
So you're Beaver
and you're Red Bear.

616
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:56,751
- Red Beard.
- She's Red Dog, and that's Beaver.

617
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:59,337
You're Red Dog. You're Beaver.

618
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:02,048
- Yeah, don't use those names.
- It's just for family.

619
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:04,050
Be nice.

620
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:05,885
Don't use the nicknames.

621
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:09,680
I don't think
I'll fuckin' call 'em anything.

622
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,433
Speaking of family...

623
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:26,072
Hello.

624
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:30,743
- Alice, this is Charlene.
- Hi.

625
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:33,746
I've heard a lot about you.

626
00:39:33,914 --> 00:39:35,831
Really? I've heard
a lot about you, too.

627
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:37,917
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Same thing you meant.

628
00:39:38,085 --> 00:39:40,127
Can we just sit down
and talk about business?

629
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:45,383
I got you another fight, Mick.
Just like I said I would.

630
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:48,302
Lou Gold and ESPN made it right.

631
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:53,974
Just like I told you. Joe Belinc.
Six weeks. The Foxwoods.

632
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:57,561
Kid's like, you know,
ten and eight, he's nothin'.

633
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:58,979
You know? And they're
gonna pay us 20 grand.

634
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:01,816
- Seventeen-five, Dick.
- Seventeen-five.

635
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:04,944
Which is still... good money, Mick.

636
00:40:05,112 --> 00:40:06,779
Yeah.

637
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:10,491
Yeah, that's good, Dick. I'm just,

638
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:13,202
you know, trying to figure out
what's best for me.

639
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:18,124
Like what?

640
00:40:22,504 --> 00:40:24,755
What's best for you, sweetheart?

641
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,007
Come on, Mick, I thought
you'd be more excited.

642
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:29,510
Why ain't you more excited?
It's a good fight, good money.

643
00:40:29,678 --> 00:40:33,013
I got tough with Lou Gold.
Told him he owes us.

644
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:38,144
Yeah, I know, Ma. I don't want things
going the way they've been going.

645
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:42,189
Mick, that last fight,
it was unfair. That was unfair.

646
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:45,693
- And we ain't gonna repeat that. Right?
- No, not on your life.

647
00:40:46,987 --> 00:40:49,196
No, but...
It's just you in the ring.

648
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:50,906
Yeah, I know it's me in the ring.

649
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:53,200
But I don't like the way things
have been going here.

650
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:55,619
- Where?
- Here. This. Us. Lowell.

651
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:57,621
The whole routine.

652
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,999
- George, stay out of it.
- You're doing all the talking.

653
00:41:00,167 --> 00:41:01,542
Let him talk. Listen.

654
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:04,503
- I'm askin' him.
- You're tellin' him.

655
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:06,046
- Listen.
- Stay out of it.

656
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:08,007
Don't tell me to stay out of it.

657
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:10,384
Mick, what's the problem?

658
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:14,221
- The problems.
- What problems?

659
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:17,641
- Problems...
- Like what?

660
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:21,896
Like, maybe you not
showing up on time to train.

661
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:25,274
Like maybe him having to come
find you in a crack house

662
00:41:25,442 --> 00:41:28,110
when you're supposed
to be at the airport.

663
00:41:30,614 --> 00:41:34,074
I'm sorry. I don't know who
you are, or why you're talking.

664
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:37,786
I'm Charlene. We just met.

665
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:40,873
We're together. Do we need
to do this again? Hi, I'm Charlene.

666
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:43,459
Hi, I'm Charlene.

667
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:44,919
Hi, I'm Charlene.

668
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:47,755
Hey, we're together!

669
00:41:48,757 --> 00:41:52,885
What are you gonna do, Mick? Listen
to some MTV girl who works in a bar?

670
00:41:53,053 --> 00:41:54,887
What's she know about boxing?

671
00:41:55,055 --> 00:42:00,017
I know that going to Vegas
and gettin' paid to train year-round

672
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:02,686
sounds a hell of a lot better
than what you got him doing here.

673
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:08,442
You gonna let her talk
like that to your mother?

674
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:10,027
Come on, Micky.

675
00:42:10,195 --> 00:42:13,781
I told you, we're together.
This is my girlfriend. I want her here.

676
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:20,079
I have done everything...
everything I could for you, Micky.

677
00:42:20,247 --> 00:42:23,666
- This MTV girl comes along...
- Stop calling me an MTV girl,

678
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:25,125
whatever the fuck that means.

679
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:26,669
- Skank.
- It's wild.

680
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:33,300
I've been doing this over 15 years.
She comes in, disrespects me.

681
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:36,136
She don't mean no disrespect, OK?

682
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:40,474
I had a chance to get paid to train
year-round, year-round, OK?

683
00:42:40,642 --> 00:42:41,892
That's all she's talking about.

684
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,978
I would hope that you guys
could appreciate that.

685
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:48,232
I know what you're talking about.
All right? I could've had that.

686
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:53,988
You know? I had... I had opportunities,
like maybe you're gonna have.

687
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:59,618
Now... You want money
so you can train year-round? Yeah?

688
00:42:59,786 --> 00:43:01,620
I'll get you money
so you can train year-round.

689
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:03,747
- You? How?
- Yeah, I'll do it. Trust me.

690
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:07,668
Hey, trust me. All right? Done.

691
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:13,716
All right? Charlene? Yeah? Everyone?

692
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:21,682
So, you put in $200, right?

693
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:24,560
Then you get ten other people
to put in 200...

694
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:28,022
...and you got your 2,000.

695
00:43:33,987 --> 00:43:37,364
- Everybody give you $200?
- No, not everybody, just ten of you.

696
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:39,074
Ten lucky ones.

697
00:43:42,621 --> 00:43:43,662
You rip us off.

698
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:45,372
No, no, I'm giving you an opportunity.

699
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,625
You give me $200.

700
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:51,754
No, you get that from ten other people
who you offer the opportunity to.

701
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:54,548
Right? You understand? No?

702
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:02,056
He thinks you think
Cambodian people are stupid.

703
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:07,353
I love Cambodian people.
I mean, look at Karen.

704
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:10,522
She's my girlfriend.
She's beautiful. I love her.

705
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:13,359
You know, and Brian.
We work on a road crew together.

706
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:17,029
- Well, not so much lately.
- We work on a road crew together.

707
00:44:17,197 --> 00:44:19,490
You haven't been showing up,
that's all I'm saying.

708
00:44:19,658 --> 00:44:22,326
This ain't an anti-Cambodian thing.

709
00:44:22,494 --> 00:44:24,411
White people do this
to other white people.

710
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:27,456
- It's what makes the world go round.
- Boo Boo, I don't think that's helping.

711
00:44:27,624 --> 00:44:31,335
I mean, this is...
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

712
00:44:36,091 --> 00:44:38,258
I mean, they didn't understand.

713
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:40,511
You know, I mean,
they're practically my gang.

714
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:44,056
Usually, they listen to what I say,
but theyjust didn't understand

715
00:44:44,224 --> 00:44:46,475
the opportunity, you know,
I was offering them.

716
00:44:46,643 --> 00:44:49,061
- What were we talking about?
- Before you fought Sugar Ray.

717
00:44:49,229 --> 00:44:52,106
Right, right, right. I mean,
Sugar Ray was too much too soon.

718
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:55,776
You know, I needed to build up slow.
You know, right?

719
00:44:55,944 --> 00:44:57,945
What's this movie about, again?

720
00:44:58,113 --> 00:45:00,656
I told you,
it's about crack addiction.

721
00:45:00,824 --> 00:45:04,702
Showing what it really is
so kids can see it for real.

722
00:45:07,247 --> 00:45:08,956
Fuck.

723
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:13,252
We gotta get Mick's money.

724
00:45:25,557 --> 00:45:28,142
Yes! That was awesome!

725
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:54,168
Go. Right now.

726
00:45:57,505 --> 00:46:00,132
Go, go, go...

727
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:15,230
- Get out of the car!
- Oh, shit!

728
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:18,025
Get out of the car, now!
Move!

729
00:46:18,193 --> 00:46:20,569
Put your hands on the roof!
Put your hands on the roof!

730
00:46:20,737 --> 00:46:22,321
- That's it! Empty your pockets!
- Are you a cop?

731
00:46:22,489 --> 00:46:26,492
Go to the fuckin' sidewalk. Move!
Fuckin' move! Don't turn around!

732
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:29,328
Don't turn around!
Gonna have to take your vehicle.

733
00:46:29,496 --> 00:46:31,997
- How am I gonna get home?
- That's your problem!

734
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:35,375
Get us some rocks.
How much we got here? Count it.

735
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,297
What the fuck?!

736
00:46:40,465 --> 00:46:43,133
That's the guy! He did it to me
and he's doing it again!

737
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:47,054
- Dicky, get on the ground, right now!
- Get that fucking!

738
00:47:18,294 --> 00:47:21,088
Ta-da! What do you think?

739
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:25,926
Open the door!
Trying to get off the fuckin' street!

740
00:47:26,094 --> 00:47:30,055
What the fuck! I'm trying
to get off the fuckin' street!

741
00:47:30,223 --> 00:47:32,266
Get your fuckin' hands off me!

742
00:47:35,103 --> 00:47:37,229
Did you hear me?!

743
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:44,278
You gotta see this!
They're fuckin' up Dicky Eklund!

744
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,826
It's Dicky! It's Dicky Eklund.
The cops are all over him.

745
00:47:50,994 --> 00:47:53,620
They're fuckin' punching him,
they're beatin' him. He needs help!

746
00:47:55,874 --> 00:47:58,542
Stay here! Don't get up. Stay here!

747
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:00,544
- Listen to him. You stay right here.
- I gotta go.

748
00:48:00,712 --> 00:48:04,089
You better get back here.
Are you fuckin' kidding me?

749
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:13,599
Hey, what the fuck? Come on,
just put him in the car!

750
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:16,310
You don't need to do that!
Just put him in the car!

751
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:18,645
- Come on, just let him go!
- You wanna get involved?

752
00:48:18,813 --> 00:48:21,106
Now you're involved!

753
00:48:21,274 --> 00:48:24,651
You're fuckin' up my brother!
I'll kill you!

754
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:26,820
He's a fighter! Break his fuckin' hands!

755
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:32,075
- Don't!
- I didn't do nothing!

756
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:34,578
- I didn't do nothing!
- Shut the fuck up.

757
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:40,459
Move 'em out!

758
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:44,546
Micky, your hand. Your hand.

759
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:46,715
Don't tell me to come on.

760
00:48:46,883 --> 00:48:48,675
Back up yourself, for Chrissake.

761
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:51,178
Hey, separate cars, separate cells.

762
00:48:51,346 --> 00:48:54,389
I don't want them making up
some bullshit defense story.

763
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:56,725
Come on, folks,
time to go home. Let's go.

764
00:48:58,353 --> 00:49:00,020
- No blankets.
- Dicky!

765
00:49:00,188 --> 00:49:01,313
What the fuck, man!

766
00:49:01,481 --> 00:49:04,232
- Micky!
- Jesus Christ.

767
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,276
Don't get involved.
You shouldn't get involved, sir.

768
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:07,861
Look at his hands.

769
00:49:08,029 --> 00:49:09,196
Shit.

770
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:15,661
Go home, folks. Good night!

771
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:39,059
Welcome back, Dicky.
That's 27 arrests.

772
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:50,278

Bail set at $25,000.
Case continued, two weeks from today.

778
00:50:10,591 --> 00:50:14,302
- Come on.
- Judy, can I the file three-57?

779
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:17,597
I need a copy
of the discovery reports as well.

780
00:50:21,477 --> 00:50:23,353
Mick, you're gonna say it
was self-defense, right?

781
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:24,646
- You did it to yourself, Dicky.
- What?

782
00:50:24,814 --> 00:50:26,064
You're gonna say it was
self-defense, right?

783
00:50:26,232 --> 00:50:28,942
You came outside, you seen them
beatin' on me, I didn't do nothin'.

784
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:31,987
Right? I was just waitin' outside like
anybody? Mick, I was doing it for you!

785
00:50:32,155 --> 00:50:33,613
You did it for me? What, this?

786
00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:36,324
Do me a favor, don't do fuckin'
nothing for me no more, OK?

787
00:50:36,492 --> 00:50:38,243
I'm fuckin' done lyin' for you.

788
00:50:38,411 --> 00:50:40,495
What are you
gonna do without me?

789
00:50:41,581 --> 00:50:43,957
This isn't how it was meant to go down!

790
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:46,043
They should've just put me in the car!

791
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:49,755
Oh, Mick, come on! Mick!

792
00:51:03,019 --> 00:51:06,313
Dicky!
Hey, what's up, Dicky?!

793
00:51:07,523 --> 00:51:09,900
Hey, Eklund!

794
00:51:10,068 --> 00:51:11,651
Dicky!

795
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:14,613
Hey, you knocked out Sugar Ray!

796
00:51:14,781 --> 00:51:17,657
Dicky, Dicky, Dicky...

797
00:52:00,576 --> 00:52:02,035
Who is it?

798
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:10,544
I don't want to see you, Micky.

799
00:52:10,711 --> 00:52:14,047
- Charlene...
- I can't take it.

800
00:52:14,215 --> 00:52:17,092
I'm not gonna let you
or your family drag me down.

801
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:19,803
I'm quitting, Charlene, OK?
I'm done fightin'.

802
00:52:19,971 --> 00:52:21,972
I don't need it anymore.

803
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:25,892
- That's fuckin' stupid.
- What? Why?

804
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:28,395
Because it's sad that you
let them take it away from you

805
00:52:28,563 --> 00:52:30,438
with their stupid bullshit.

806
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:34,734
What else can I do, Charlene?

807
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:36,403
There's a lot you can do, Micky.

808
00:52:36,571 --> 00:52:38,321
There's this guy that
your dad wants you to meet.

809
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:41,241
You just don't think you
can do it without Dicky.

810
00:52:41,409 --> 00:52:43,743
Charlene...

811
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:45,245
Don't call.

812
00:52:45,413 --> 00:52:47,414
Come on.

813
00:52:47,582 --> 00:52:49,249
Don't call me, OK?

814
00:52:58,551 --> 00:53:00,927
Hey, Dicky, you hurtin', man?

815
00:53:02,597 --> 00:53:04,598
Poor fucker!

816
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:09,269
Hang in there, man!

817
00:53:09,437 --> 00:53:11,188
Go, Dicky!

818
00:53:17,862 --> 00:53:19,487
Hey, Dicky!

819
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:22,824
Hey, keep it quiet!

820
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:41,509
Hey, Micky!
Bring another bucket, huh?

821
00:53:43,596 --> 00:53:44,846
Good.

822
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:58,193
And this Friday,
an HBO original documentary.

823
00:53:58,361 --> 00:54:01,321
Right here in Lowell, Mass,
the story of Dick Eklund,

824
00:54:01,489 --> 00:54:03,573
a once-promising boxer
who turned criminal...

825
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:19,881
Oh, look who it is.

826
00:54:23,552 --> 00:54:24,886
That's him.
That's Dicky's brother.

827
00:54:25,054 --> 00:54:26,346
- Hey, Micky.
- Regular.

828
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,351
Hey.

829
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:34,771
- Hey, what's up, Mick?
- Look who's here.

830
00:54:36,691 --> 00:54:39,025
- Good to see you, bro.
- How you doing?

831
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:41,361
How you feeling? How's the hand?

832
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:44,823
- It's gettin' there.
- Looks better.

833
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:48,618
Why don't you come down to the gym?
And work out. If you want.

834
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:51,955
- Hey, you fat fuck, you're getting big.
- Yeah, I know. I just...

835
00:54:52,123 --> 00:54:54,165
Been roofin' with my father,
spending time with Kasie.

836
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:56,167
Now I gotta worry about
this movie on HBO tonight.

837
00:54:56,335 --> 00:54:57,836
What are yous looking at?

838
00:54:59,171 --> 00:55:01,756
Movie's not about him.
It's about his crazy brother.

839
00:55:01,924 --> 00:55:03,633
I gotta go.

840
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:06,428
- Come back to the gym, Mick.
- Bye, Mick!

841
00:55:06,595 --> 00:55:09,639
Don't go watch
that crazy shit on TV, don't!

842
00:55:15,187 --> 00:55:16,896
Hollywood!

843
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:21,234
Get a look! Get a look, all right!

844
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:25,947
Going to Hollywood!
Going to Hollywood, yeah!

845
00:55:30,745 --> 00:55:32,579
All right!

846
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:42,464
All right, get this started!

847
00:55:55,603 --> 00:55:58,730
Lowell was the birthplace of
the Industrial Revolution in America.

848
00:55:58,898 --> 00:56:02,525
Industrial Revolution... Lowell.

849
00:56:03,361 --> 00:56:06,821
I used to live over there.
This town got good memories, right?

850
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:08,948
- Check it out.
- Fuck, yeah.

851
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:11,785
- This house here, this white house?
- Oh, yeah.

852
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:14,496
White, big fat guy.
First time I got my crack, over here.

853
00:56:14,663 --> 00:56:16,790
Did you ever know that?
They smoke crack at the White House?

854
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:20,251
White, black, Puerto Rican, everything.

855
00:56:20,419 --> 00:56:22,921
The first time I did crack, or whatever,
I was about 23

856
00:56:23,089 --> 00:56:24,798
and a friend of mine gave me
a gram, or whatever.

857
00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:26,883
Fuck, I wish that'd never happened.

858
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:30,512
Before that, I'd been doing
the Silver Mittens and stuff.

859
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:34,224
I was the only kid.
I'd be 12... I was shit... faced.

860
00:56:34,392 --> 00:56:35,975
I'll tell ya how crack works.

861
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:42,107
When it enters your lungs...
When it enters your lungs...

862
00:56:42,274 --> 00:56:45,985
- I wanna watch, Daddy.
- Oh, my God. No, sweetie.

863
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:49,280
- You go back upstairs.
- But I wanna watch Daddy on TV.

864
00:56:49,448 --> 00:56:52,492
I know, baby. You can't watch
Daddy right now, all right?

865
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:55,161
You go back upstairs
and go to bed, OK?

866
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:57,414
OK, yeah, there's my boys
right there. Check 'em out.

867
00:56:57,581 --> 00:57:01,126
- What kind of snake's that? Python?
- Yeah, check it out, man.

868
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:03,586
- It's not gonna bite me or something?
- He's cool.

869
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:08,716
It's been a while.
I'll take anything right now.

870
00:57:10,094 --> 00:57:11,928
I never thought
I'd kiss a fuckin' snake.

871
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:13,471
I always dreamed about it...

872
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:18,226
Do a lot of shit
when you're high, right?

873
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:23,273
Dicky... put Lowell on the map.

874
00:57:23,441 --> 00:57:25,984
He knocked Sugar Ray Leonard down.

875
00:57:26,152 --> 00:57:30,947
Yeah, he knocked him down,
but I don't think it was a knockdown.

876
00:57:31,115 --> 00:57:33,783
- I think he slipped.
- He knocked him down.

877
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:36,286
- He didn't slip.
- He slipped.

878
00:57:36,454 --> 00:57:38,705
- Oh... and you're from Lowell.
- Yeah, come on.

879
00:57:38,873 --> 00:57:42,292
- That's a fuckin' lie!
- They said he's in trouble with drugs.

880
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:45,211
What is this? Are you talking
shit about the family?

881
00:57:45,379 --> 00:57:48,548
- Oh, no, no, no...
- I heard you say "Dicky, Micky..."

882
00:57:48,716 --> 00:57:50,717
We're not like that.
This is not what Lowell is all about.

883
00:57:50,885 --> 00:57:52,260
I thought he could make a comeback

884
00:57:52,428 --> 00:57:55,221
- and make us proud, but he didn't.
- I don't know what Dicky was thinking.

885
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:57,515
Very disappointing,
very disgusting.

886
00:57:57,683 --> 00:58:00,894
You brought the city of
Lowell back 30 years. We're not happy.

887
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:02,812
- Hello?
- Jimmy?

888
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:05,565
Hey, will you do me a favor?
Make sure Kasie's not watching HBO?

889
00:58:05,733 --> 00:58:08,318
Actually, we're watching it right now,
Mick, but don't worry about it.

890
00:58:08,486 --> 00:58:10,153
I got it...

891
00:58:10,321 --> 00:58:13,406
I want her to see it.
Let her see who her uncle is.

892
00:58:13,574 --> 00:58:14,949
- What?
- Who you are.

893
00:58:15,117 --> 00:58:17,243
Who I am?
What are you talking about?

894
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:20,622
- Kids need to know the truth, Mick.
- Laurie, turn it off, please.

895
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:23,166
She does not need to see this.
She doesn't need to see it.

896
00:58:23,334 --> 00:58:24,751
She's a kid.

897
00:58:25,252 --> 00:58:28,755
When you smoke crack, you know...

898
00:58:28,923 --> 00:58:31,090
...you feel so much lighter.

899
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:34,469
You know, you feel young, like when
everything was in front of you,

900
00:58:34,637 --> 00:58:36,971
everything was just...

901
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:41,142
...everything was... just...

902
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:43,186
...it was in front of you, you know?

903
00:58:44,605 --> 00:58:46,940
And then...

904
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:49,776
...it fades and you
gotta get high again.

905
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:58,785
Your part in the movie
is gonna end with you going to jail.

906
00:59:00,579 --> 00:59:04,707
What about little Dicky?
Who's gonna take care of him, huh?

907
00:59:07,962 --> 00:59:10,463
You guys can't talk to 'em?

908
00:59:11,632 --> 00:59:13,508
Oh, man...

909
00:59:13,676 --> 00:59:16,219
Turn this shit off.
Turn this off, all right?

910
00:59:16,387 --> 00:59:18,346
Turn it off. Will you turn this off?

911
00:59:18,514 --> 00:59:21,015
If you don't...
I'm turning it fuckin' off.

912
00:59:24,311 --> 00:59:25,979
Hey, hey, that is my life.

913
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:27,689
- My movie night!
- That's my fuckin' life out there.

914
00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:30,692
- I wanna watch this. I don't care.
- I will fuck you up!

915
00:59:30,859 --> 00:59:33,444
You fuckin' want some?
Don't fuckin' try me.

916
00:59:33,612 --> 00:59:36,155
I still fuckin' got it, OK?

917
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:38,074
You fuckin' want some?!

918
00:59:38,242 --> 00:59:40,910
That's my son there,
and you're laughin' at him?!

919
00:59:42,538 --> 00:59:47,333
That's my son. He's crying. He needs me.
And I'm fuckin' stuck in here?

920
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:50,503
But you know what?
Dicky was a street kid.

921
00:59:50,671 --> 00:59:54,841
Micky, you watching this?
What are they doing to us?

922
00:59:56,552 --> 00:59:59,887
Ma, I don't know what to tell you.

923
01:00:00,055 --> 01:00:01,973
You're pretending like you
don't know what's going on.

924
01:00:02,141 --> 01:00:04,058
He's been doing this for years.

925
01:00:05,311 --> 01:00:08,354
Yeah, I know it's horrible, Ma, but...

926
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:15,361
- What do you think?
- You think they set him up?

927
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:17,572
What do you think he was doing?

928
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:21,159
You know, gave him money,
gave him drugs for the movie. Right?

929
01:00:24,496 --> 01:00:28,124
Micky... Micky?

930
01:00:29,043 --> 01:00:30,710
Shit. Micky...

931
01:02:46,597 --> 01:02:48,639
- You got a new bag, huh?
- Yup.

932
01:02:48,807 --> 01:02:51,017
- New bracket, too?
- Yup.

933
01:02:51,185 --> 01:02:53,853
- What happened to the peanut?
- I don't know.

934
01:02:54,772 --> 01:02:56,355
It's like a beach ball.

935
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:27,488
- Mick. Sal Lonano.
- Hey, Mick, how you doing?

936
01:04:27,656 --> 01:04:29,198
You own a cab company,
you're a good businessman, right?

937
01:04:29,366 --> 01:04:32,285
- Yeah, he's very organized.
- How's the hand?

938
01:04:32,452 --> 01:04:35,454
It's good. You know,
it's getting better. Stronger.

939
01:04:35,622 --> 01:04:39,333
Yeah, you know, I made a few calls
already. I talked to Buddy Tags.

940
01:04:39,501 --> 01:04:43,212
Said he can set up something local,
something to start back with.

941
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,298
- Get your confidence back.
- That's it.

942
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:47,300
You gotta get your confidence back.
That's all.

943
01:04:49,761 --> 01:04:53,973
Your dad wants Sal to manage ya,
and he wants me to train ya.

944
01:04:54,141 --> 01:04:56,642
But I'll only do it on one condition.

945
01:04:58,645 --> 01:05:02,648
- No crazy-time nonsense.
- It's how it's gotta be.

946
01:05:02,816 --> 01:05:06,068
- No Dicky. No Alice.
- No Dicky. No Alice.

947
01:05:06,236 --> 01:05:08,863
I get it, I get it.
I'm good, I understand.

948
01:05:09,031 --> 01:05:11,324
- Look, I appreciate the opportunity.
- I can't take the bullshit, Mick.

949
01:05:11,491 --> 01:05:14,327
- No offense, Georgie.
- None taken.

950
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:17,747
I'm gonna be the one who gets
his balls cut off, anyway.

951
01:05:18,874 --> 01:05:21,500
- Yeah. You laugh.
- You...

952
01:05:21,668 --> 01:05:24,837
...fuckin' traitor!
- What are you doing?

953
01:05:25,505 --> 01:05:29,884
What the hell's the matter with you?!
Come on! The pans hurt!

954
01:05:30,052 --> 01:05:31,344
Do they hurt?! I hope it hurts!

955
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:33,846
- Sal Lonano is a good man!
- A good man?!

956
01:05:34,014 --> 01:05:36,223
He's a legitimate businessman,
for Chrissakes!

957
01:05:36,391 --> 01:05:38,517
- Legitimate businessman?
- Yes. What?

958
01:05:38,685 --> 01:05:40,269
Oh, my God,
you know what that sounds like?

959
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:43,064
- He's a crook, George!
- He owns a taxi cab company!

960
01:05:43,231 --> 01:05:45,566
- He's organized!
- Oh, my God. He's a cab driver.

961
01:05:45,734 --> 01:05:47,193
He knows everything
about boxing, right?

962
01:05:47,361 --> 01:05:51,489
I don't think so! He's gonna steal
your son's money and rob him blind!

963
01:05:51,657 --> 01:05:54,158
Why would you think that?
Why would you even think that?

964
01:05:54,326 --> 01:05:56,869
- Why can't you trust anybody with?
- I know people.

965
01:05:57,037 --> 01:05:59,622
I know, George, you think I don't
know anything, but I know people.

966
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:01,707
- I know you know people.
- And that Sal Lonano

967
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:05,544
banana fucking thing,
we don't need that in our lives!

968
01:06:05,712 --> 01:06:07,546
We haven't made one dollar
with these kids!

969
01:06:07,714 --> 01:06:10,257
- You betrayed me!
- Oh, bullshit, I betrayed you.

970
01:06:10,425 --> 01:06:12,551
- You always react the same way.
- He's a fuckin' crook!

971
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:15,388
What's Micky supposed to do?
Dicky's in jail!

972
01:06:15,555 --> 01:06:18,349
We're not talking about his trainer,
sweetheart!

973
01:06:18,517 --> 01:06:21,644
We're talking about his manager,
that's me!

974
01:06:21,812 --> 01:06:23,980
But, Mom, maybe Micky
should try something different!

975
01:06:24,147 --> 01:06:26,107
What are you doing opening
your mouth in my kitchen?

976
01:06:26,274 --> 01:06:30,069
- You owe me $200.
- I said I was gonna pay you next week.

977
01:06:30,237 --> 01:06:31,862
I don't want
another word outta you.

978
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:33,572
That was last month
you told me two weeks.

979
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:36,993
You take sides against me in
my own house, you owe me money?

980
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:38,744
And Ma's been great
to Micky, Sherri.

981
01:06:38,912 --> 01:06:41,872
Really, I mean, who's gonna look out
for Micky better than his own mother?

982
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:44,792
It's that fuckin' girl, Charlene.
We gotta get rid of her.

983
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:47,878
Ma, we gotta get rid of her.
It's that girl, Charlene. She gotta go.

984
01:06:48,046 --> 01:06:49,422
You're gonna get Charlene involved?

985
01:06:49,589 --> 01:06:53,092
- Is that what you're telling me?
- I know where she lives.

986
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:54,719
What are you pickin' on her for?

987
01:06:54,886 --> 01:06:57,763
She lives in that
yellow house on Stevens Street.

988
01:06:57,931 --> 01:07:00,391
I'm gonna go talk to Micky,
sort this out for myself.

989
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:05,604
Yeah, sure. You go handle it
with your vigilantes. All of yous now.

990
01:07:05,772 --> 01:07:06,856
This is wrong, Alice!

991
01:07:14,448 --> 01:07:15,740
I got it!

992
01:07:15,907 --> 01:07:17,700
Get outta my way! Get in the car!

993
01:07:18,326 --> 01:07:20,202
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

994
01:07:20,954 --> 01:07:22,788
Get in the car.

995
01:07:46,063 --> 01:07:48,397
- Yeah, they're in there!
- Up there on the second floor.

996
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:50,066
Micky!

997
01:07:50,984 --> 01:07:54,737
Where the hell are you?
You up there? Come on down!

998
01:07:54,905 --> 01:07:56,447
Where are you?

999
01:07:57,491 --> 01:08:00,409
Holy shit, Micky, your mother
and your sisters are here.

1000
01:08:00,577 --> 01:08:03,579
No, don't.
Do not go out there. Please.

1001
01:08:03,747 --> 01:08:07,333
No, I'm not hiding from
your crazy fuckin' family.

1002
01:08:18,887 --> 01:08:20,096
Hi.

1003
01:08:20,263 --> 01:08:21,972
Well, well, well.
Look at this.

1004
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:23,265
Look at what?

1005
01:08:24,226 --> 01:08:27,436
- Why you hiding from us, Micky?
- He's not hiding.

1006
01:08:27,604 --> 01:08:30,106
Wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to my son.

1007
01:08:30,273 --> 01:08:31,690
What are you doing, Mickster?

1008
01:08:31,858 --> 01:08:34,193
I'm right here.
I ain't hiding from nobody, Alice.

1009
01:08:34,361 --> 01:08:38,030
You're not helping yourself with
your father's scumbag friend Lonano.

1010
01:08:38,198 --> 01:08:40,574
What are you gonna do,
turn your back on Dicky next?

1011
01:08:42,285 --> 01:08:44,954
All we ever wanted for you
was to be world champion.

1012
01:08:45,122 --> 01:08:47,665
Micky's a grown man.
He can think for himself.

1013
01:08:47,833 --> 01:08:50,209
- Shut your mouth.
- Skank.

1014
01:08:50,377 --> 01:08:53,921
Don't call me skank. I'll rip that nasty
hair right out of your fuckin' head.

1015
01:08:54,089 --> 01:08:56,465
I'm his mother. And his manager.

1016
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:58,884
You're not my manager anymore.
And I'm not waiting for Dicky, OK?

1017
01:08:59,052 --> 01:09:00,845
I'm not gettin' any younger.

1018
01:09:01,012 --> 01:09:02,888
Who's gonna look after you, sweetheart?

1019
01:09:03,056 --> 01:09:06,559
I mean, come on. I know you don't
understand it, but I had nine kids

1020
01:09:06,726 --> 01:09:10,062
- and I love every one of you the same.
- You got a funny way of showing it,

1021
01:09:10,230 --> 01:09:12,064
letting him get beat up,
letting him get his hand broken.

1022
01:09:12,232 --> 01:09:14,984
- You're crazy.
- You fuckin' bar skank!

1023
01:09:15,152 --> 01:09:17,695
- What did I just say to you?
- Don't put your hands on her...

1024
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:24,910
- Get off of me!
- Stop it!

1025
01:09:27,038 --> 01:09:29,373
Let her go!
Let her go!

1026
01:09:31,376 --> 01:09:33,419
- Fuck you, Charlene!
- Fuck you!

1027
01:09:33,587 --> 01:09:37,423
- Get the fuck outta here! Now!
- Fuck you, Charlene!

1028
01:09:37,591 --> 01:09:39,466
- Skank!
- Micky...

1029
01:09:42,387 --> 01:09:45,222
- Fuckin' bitch!
- Oh, my God! Gail!

1030
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:47,474
What'd she do to your nose?

1031
01:09:55,108 --> 01:09:57,276
What is happenin'?
What is happenin' to everybody?

1032
01:09:57,444 --> 01:09:59,778
I don't understand, sweetheart.

1033
01:10:44,824 --> 01:10:48,661
Why... Why do you think
I spell my name with an E?

1034
01:10:48,828 --> 01:10:50,287
'Cause I don't.

1035
01:10:50,455 --> 01:10:52,748
- No-E Micky Ward.
- Hey, somebody push the button.

1036
01:10:54,501 --> 01:10:57,086
- Where we going? What's with the ring?
- Ring's across the street.

1037
01:10:57,254 --> 01:10:59,255
- The ring's across the street?
- Yeah.

1038
01:10:59,422 --> 01:11:01,966
Yeah, smaller venue.
They got no dressin' rooms over there.

1039
01:11:02,133 --> 01:11:06,136
- Yeah, but...
- Micky, It's just a start. Don't worry.

1040
01:11:08,515 --> 01:11:11,558
Hey. Good luck.

1041
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:24,863
That's it!

1042
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:30,869
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

1043
01:12:57,123 --> 01:12:59,208
Visit for Dick Eklund.

1044
01:12:59,376 --> 01:13:00,584
Dicky!

1045
01:13:00,752 --> 01:13:03,045
Eklund, you got a visitor!

1046
01:13:04,297 --> 01:13:08,384
Heard you won a bunch of fights, Mick.
That's good.

1047
01:13:08,551 --> 01:13:10,427
I know you know what I been doing.

1048
01:13:10,595 --> 01:13:13,305
I'm sure Alice
and everybody else told you.

1049
01:13:13,473 --> 01:13:16,058
I just wanted to tell you
to your face myself.

1050
01:13:16,226 --> 01:13:19,645
I got new management.
Mickey O'Keefe's my trainer now.

1051
01:13:19,813 --> 01:13:21,772
It's all good.

1052
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:25,192
Yeah. They got you fightin'
Alfonso Sanchez.

1053
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:26,944
- On HBO.
- And you're proud of that?

1054
01:13:27,112 --> 01:13:31,031
- Fuckin' right.
- HBO is invested in the Mexican.

1055
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:33,158
I didn't think they were gonna be
invested in me?

1056
01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:36,620
- I got a shot. I'm gonna take it.
- Wake up.

1057
01:13:36,788 --> 01:13:38,831
They don't care if he kills you.

1058
01:13:38,998 --> 01:13:43,544
Mike Toma did it. He's using you,
like a stepping-stone for Sanchez.

1059
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:48,340
- Why don't you see?
- Oh, I see.

1060
01:13:48,508 --> 01:13:52,010
How could I stand a chance without the
great Dick Eklund in my corner, right?

1061
01:13:52,178 --> 01:13:54,471
You didn't give a fuck
if I got killed by Mungin.

1062
01:13:54,639 --> 01:13:58,350
Now all of a sudden you're worried
Sanchez is gonna hurt me? Why?

1063
01:13:58,518 --> 01:14:01,437
'Cause you're stuck in here and can't
be the center of attention no more?

1064
01:14:01,604 --> 01:14:03,355
- You need it that bad?
- I've seen this Mexican fight.

1065
01:14:03,523 --> 01:14:06,316
He fights, hits,
like a fuckin' mule, all right?

1066
01:14:06,484 --> 01:14:08,735
Fifteen knockouts, undefeated.
You crazy?

1067
01:14:08,903 --> 01:14:11,363
And that taxi cab idiot,
Lonano, he went right for it.

1068
01:14:11,531 --> 01:14:14,158
He's a paper gangster,
he's using you to steal money.

1069
01:14:14,325 --> 01:14:17,661
Why can't you just shut up
and be happy for me?

1070
01:14:17,829 --> 01:14:21,039
I spent the last ten years of my life
in bad fights set up by you and Alice.

1071
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:22,916
I finally got a good thing going for me

1072
01:14:23,084 --> 01:14:25,836
and you can't be fuckin'
happy for me? Why?

1073
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,047
What's your plan?
How you gonna fight Sanchez?

1074
01:14:29,215 --> 01:14:32,801
- I ain't here to talk about that.
- What's your plan?

1075
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:35,512
- I am not here to talk about that.
- What's your plan?

1076
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:37,639
Yes, you are.

1077
01:14:37,807 --> 01:14:39,850
You watch the fight
and you'll see the plan.

1078
01:14:40,018 --> 01:14:43,228
I can't watch it. They don't let us.
It's too fuckin' violent. I mean...

1079
01:14:43,396 --> 01:14:44,771
Two minutes, Dicky.

1080
01:14:44,939 --> 01:14:47,274
They'll let us watch a stupid
documentary about crack,

1081
01:14:47,442 --> 01:14:51,195
but I can't watch my own
brother fighting, you know?

1082
01:14:51,362 --> 01:14:55,115
Hey... Mick, what is it?

1083
01:14:55,283 --> 01:14:57,576
You scared? You embarrassed
because you don't even have a plan?

1084
01:14:57,744 --> 01:14:59,745
I'm your brother. Just tell me.

1085
01:14:59,913 --> 01:15:01,538
Are you gonna shit on it
no matter what I say?

1086
01:15:01,706 --> 01:15:03,582
I'm not gonna shit on it. Just tell me.

1087
01:15:06,669 --> 01:15:08,754
Go toe-to-toe.
Overhand right in the middle rounds.

1088
01:15:08,922 --> 01:15:11,048
He's weak against the overhand right.

1089
01:15:12,258 --> 01:15:14,551
Who came up with that?
Fatty fuck O'Keefe?

1090
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:15,761
Fuck you, Dicky.

1091
01:15:16,387 --> 01:15:19,014
You gotta run against this guy.
Let him punch himself out.

1092
01:15:19,182 --> 01:15:21,225
Take him to the body, right? Get inside.

1093
01:15:21,392 --> 01:15:24,102
Switch stances like you're gonna
work his right, hit him on the left.

1094
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:26,188
You ain't me. All right?
You can't be me.

1095
01:15:26,356 --> 01:15:27,940
- Careful. Switch outside...
- You had a hard enough time

1096
01:15:28,107 --> 01:15:29,775
being you when you had
your fuckin' chance,

1097
01:15:29,943 --> 01:15:33,403
and that's why you're in here.
I'll fight Sanchez the way I fight.

1098
01:15:33,571 --> 01:15:36,114
I'm talking about the way
you fight, you moron!

1099
01:15:37,534 --> 01:15:40,369
Yeah, you know I'm right!
He knows I'm right. All right.

1100
01:15:43,831 --> 01:15:45,290
He knows I'm right.

1101
01:15:48,795 --> 01:15:54,216
Ward's record: 29 wins,
seven losses so far, 20 KOs.

1102
01:15:54,384 --> 01:15:57,678
He's been a little better since
he refocused himself on the sport,

1103
01:15:57,845 --> 01:15:59,388
as JB pointed out.

1104
01:16:04,936 --> 01:16:09,398
Now, here's Ward's opponent,
Alfonso Sanchez, out of Tijuana, Mexico.

1105
01:16:09,566 --> 01:16:14,653
You see the record: 16 wins,
15 KOs, eight first-round KOs.

1106
01:16:14,821 --> 01:16:16,572
There's Mike Toma,
the promoter of the fight,

1107
01:16:16,739 --> 01:16:18,323
who has a lot invested in Sanchez.

1108
01:16:18,491 --> 01:16:20,117
And he says that Sanchez is

1109
01:16:20,285 --> 01:16:24,580
one of the most talented young
prospects in the sport of boxing.

1110
01:16:33,798 --> 01:16:38,760
This is really one of
the saddest kinds of fights in boxing.

1111
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:41,597
- Get out of the corner!
- Micky Ward is 31 years old,

1112
01:16:41,764 --> 01:16:44,766
he's here because he needs the money,
he's taking a beating...

1113
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:47,185
And my point is
that he doesn't really have to sit here

1114
01:16:47,353 --> 01:16:49,980
and take this beating.
He can do something about it.

1115
01:16:50,148 --> 01:16:52,190
Which is what?
Have his corner throw in the towel?

1116
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:54,401
- Or fight back.
- Get back.

1117
01:16:56,779 --> 01:16:57,863
You can see his power.

1118
01:16:58,031 --> 01:16:59,948
Every time he hits Ward,
he backs him up.

1119
01:17:00,116 --> 01:17:02,034
How about taking points away from him?

1120
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:04,995
Larry, unless
the referee does, you can't.

1121
01:17:05,163 --> 01:17:06,663
The referee should just go
ahead and stop this fight.

1122
01:17:06,831 --> 01:17:10,334
He knows that Micky doesn't want
to be here. I wouldn't even make...

1123
01:17:10,501 --> 01:17:12,544
He's fightin' scared, Dick.

1124
01:17:12,712 --> 01:17:14,796
Runnin' away, not hittin' back.

1125
01:17:14,964 --> 01:17:18,550
Oh, Jesus. He's gonna get hurt.

1126
01:17:18,718 --> 01:17:20,719
Doing that same old shit.

1127
01:17:20,887 --> 01:17:23,180
They never seen such
an embarrassing performance.

1128
01:17:23,348 --> 01:17:25,390
He's doing what I told him, Ma.
He's doing what I told him.

1129
01:17:25,558 --> 01:17:27,225
Don't worry about it.
He's doing what I told him.

1130
01:17:27,393 --> 01:17:30,228
Micky Ward, showing nothing
but respect.

1131
01:17:30,396 --> 01:17:31,980
What are you runnin' around for?
Stop running around!

1132
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:35,192
Shut the fuck up, Sal!
Shut the fuck up!

1133
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:37,694
I don't know what you're doing, Micky.
Want to fuckin' tell me?

1134
01:17:37,862 --> 01:17:39,071
'Cause I don't know what you're doing.

1135
01:17:39,238 --> 01:17:41,740
We have lost all five rounds,
is that what you want?

1136
01:17:41,908 --> 01:17:44,201
Dreadful.
This is dreadful, dreadful stuff.

1137
01:17:44,369 --> 01:17:46,953
You gotta show me something soon,
Mick, or I'm gonna stop the fight.

1138
01:17:47,121 --> 01:17:48,246
Now they're gonna stop the fight, Micky.

1139
01:17:48,414 --> 01:17:50,290
He's gotta go inside, Ma.

1140
01:17:50,458 --> 01:17:52,584
He's gotta take it to the body.
He's gotta.

1141
01:17:52,752 --> 01:17:53,960
Come on, get your punches up...

1142
01:17:54,128 --> 01:17:56,338
- Don't stop the fight.
- They're gonna stop this fight.

1143
01:17:56,506 --> 01:17:58,674
Then you gotta do something, baby.

1144
01:17:58,841 --> 01:18:00,467
That's not what we talked about, Micky.

1145
01:18:00,635 --> 01:18:03,679
We had a plan and you're
not doing it. Now, let's go.

1146
01:18:03,846 --> 01:18:04,888
All right, Micky.

1147
01:18:05,056 --> 01:18:08,934
You've lost the first five rounds.
What's the next strategy gonna be?

1148
01:18:09,102 --> 01:18:12,854
Double right hand by Sanchez,
then a triple left hook.

1149
01:18:13,022 --> 01:18:15,982
A couple of the left hooks landed
flush on the cheek of Micky Ward.

1150
01:18:16,150 --> 01:18:18,443
Ward tying Sanchez up.

1151
01:18:18,611 --> 01:18:20,404
Very curious performance
by Micky Ward.

1152
01:18:20,571 --> 01:18:21,863
Come on, Micky, come on!

1153
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:24,825
Ward seems...
trying to land one big shot

1154
01:18:24,992 --> 01:18:27,244
to change Sanchez's mind...

1155
01:18:27,412 --> 01:18:29,079
And he's beginning to open up.

1156
01:18:29,247 --> 01:18:31,790
Taking advantage of more and more
opportunities to get close to Ward

1157
01:18:31,958 --> 01:18:33,375
and throw against a fighter...

1158
01:18:33,543 --> 01:18:34,543
Time!

1159
01:18:34,711 --> 01:18:37,045
...who's not defending himself
by punching.

1160
01:18:37,797 --> 01:18:40,132
Sanchez is gonna try
to end this fight.

1161
01:18:46,723 --> 01:18:48,598
- What are you doing? Come on!
- That's it.

1162
01:18:49,642 --> 01:18:50,976
Good boy!

1163
01:18:52,353 --> 01:18:53,645
He's down on an uppercut!

1164
01:18:57,817 --> 01:19:01,319
- Nicely thrown left uppercut inside.
...three, four, five...

1165
01:19:01,487 --> 01:19:04,698
And right after Ward threw
a pretty good right hand.

1166
01:19:04,866 --> 01:19:07,826
Mick, you all right?
Come to me. Come to me.

1167
01:19:07,994 --> 01:19:09,870
This is a fight
that should be stopped.

1168
01:19:11,247 --> 01:19:12,789
Come on, head, body, head.

1169
01:19:15,626 --> 01:19:17,085
This is not professional.

1170
01:19:17,253 --> 01:19:19,004
That's exactly what I'm saying.

1171
01:19:19,172 --> 01:19:22,174
- Punch him! You gotta punch!
- Someone should pay me to watch this.

1172
01:19:22,341 --> 01:19:25,343
Come on, man! Head, body, head!

1173
01:19:27,054 --> 01:19:28,346
That was a good body shot by Ward.

1174
01:19:28,514 --> 01:19:30,974
That was good.
Maybe it'll turn him around.

1175
01:19:31,142 --> 01:19:33,310
Maybe. I'm talking about if I...

1176
01:19:34,645 --> 01:19:37,522
Sanchez drops
like he's shot! Oh, my God!

1177
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:41,735
The most unlikely
knockout you have ever seen.

1178
01:19:41,903 --> 01:19:44,780
That was a kidney shot,
the kind of kidney shot...

1179
01:19:44,947 --> 01:19:46,865
...nine, ten!

1180
01:19:49,452 --> 01:19:51,745
I still don't believe
what I just saw.

1181
01:19:55,708 --> 01:19:57,876
Oh, Micky won!

1182
01:20:00,463 --> 01:20:02,798
Now, did Micky Ward
just make idiots of us all

1183
01:20:02,965 --> 01:20:06,968
with a spectacular piece of strategy?
Take another look. Amazing.

1184
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:09,721
A brilliant win in the career
of Micky Ward out of Lowell, Mass.

1185
01:20:09,889 --> 01:20:13,183
Unbelievable defeat
at the hands of Micky Ward,

1186
01:20:13,351 --> 01:20:17,729
who had all but given away the first
half-dozen rounds of the battle.

1187
01:20:17,897 --> 01:20:20,023
I think what Micky did was he recognized

1188
01:20:20,191 --> 01:20:21,942
that he'd hurt the guy
with the body shot.

1189
01:20:22,109 --> 01:20:24,903
Micky's a better fighter than that to
not be runnin' from that guy like that.

1190
01:20:25,071 --> 01:20:27,030
Theater of the unexpected.

1191
01:20:27,198 --> 01:20:29,533
Hey, you never know
what can happen, right?

1192
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:31,159
Never give up in this game, right?
Never give up.

1193
01:20:32,161 --> 01:20:33,745
You can't make it up, folks.

1194
01:20:33,913 --> 01:20:35,372
You hear what he said?

1195
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:37,207
He said, "You can't give up
in this game."

1196
01:20:37,375 --> 01:20:40,252
Well, maybe Micky Ward
heard me say you should stop this fight

1197
01:20:40,419 --> 01:20:42,087
and he went out and stopped it.

1198
01:20:42,922 --> 01:20:45,465
- Right there. Right there.
- Yeah! I can't believe it.

1199
01:20:45,633 --> 01:20:48,468
I'm lookin' over, and I'm thinkin'
to myself like they were thinkin':

1200
01:20:48,636 --> 01:20:49,845
This thing is over.

1201
01:20:50,012 --> 01:20:51,930
But I tell you what, if you
looked at the commentators,

1202
01:20:52,098 --> 01:20:54,683
they started to take their headsets off
before he was even counted out.

1203
01:20:54,851 --> 01:20:56,184
Theyjust wanted to get out of there.

1204
01:20:56,352 --> 01:20:59,020
Mick, Mick.
I just spoke to Mike Toma.

1205
01:20:59,188 --> 01:21:01,523
- He told me something very interesting.
- Holy shit, what?

1206
01:21:01,691 --> 01:21:03,024
He just told me,

1207
01:21:03,192 --> 01:21:05,735
had Sanchez won tonight,
he would've gotten the title shot.

1208
01:21:05,903 --> 01:21:08,947
- Holy Christ, that's beautiful.
- Why? Why is that beautiful?

1209
01:21:09,115 --> 01:21:13,702
- A title shot. Mick gets the shot.
- Micky gets the shot!

1210
01:21:13,870 --> 01:21:17,247
- Are you kidding me?
- Are you sure about that?

1211
01:21:17,415 --> 01:21:20,625
I just spoke to the guy. Mike!
Come here, Mike. Look, tell these guys.

1212
01:21:20,793 --> 01:21:22,544
- Hey, Mike Toma. Thank you.
- Congratulations.

1213
01:21:22,712 --> 01:21:25,797
You're not a stepping stone anymore.
I always knew you had the talent.

1214
01:21:25,965 --> 01:21:28,758
That was a hell of a strategy, wearing
him down and taking it to the body.

1215
01:21:28,926 --> 01:21:31,845
Thirty years in the business,
I'd never seen a knockout like that.

1216
01:21:32,013 --> 01:21:33,471
Larry Merchant was writing
your obituary,

1217
01:21:33,639 --> 01:21:34,931
and Sanchez drops
like he's shot with a gun.

1218
01:21:35,099 --> 01:21:36,808
Where'd you get that?

1219
01:21:36,976 --> 01:21:38,310
That's the first thing
my brother taught me.

1220
01:21:38,477 --> 01:21:39,895
Tap 'em to the head,
ding 'em to the body.

1221
01:21:40,062 --> 01:21:42,063
- That's a hell of a body shot.
- Thank you.

1222
01:21:42,231 --> 01:21:45,317
- You ready for a title shot?
- I ain't gettin' no younger.

1223
01:21:45,943 --> 01:21:48,236
Thanks, Mr. Toma. Thank you.

1224
01:21:48,404 --> 01:21:50,322
He's ready. You're ready, aren't ya?

1225
01:21:51,282 --> 01:21:53,867
Shea Neary in London
for the title.

1226
01:21:54,035 --> 01:21:55,952
Are you kidding,
we got some celebrating to do.

1227
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:57,495
- Yeah, I think so.
- Thank you so much.

1228
01:21:57,663 --> 01:22:00,165
- Gonna have a great champ in my boy.
- Thank you, Mr. Toma.

1229
01:22:02,710 --> 01:22:04,669
It's what your brother
would've always wanted.

1230
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:06,588
He's not even gonna be there.

1231
01:22:32,657 --> 01:22:35,700
- Hey!
- Daddy!

1232
01:22:35,868 --> 01:22:37,869
- Come here, buddy.
- Daddy, Daddy!

1233
01:22:38,996 --> 01:22:41,164
Good to see you!

1234
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:46,836
That's a good hug!
That's a good hug! Yeah!

1235
01:22:47,004 --> 01:22:49,297
- Sweetheart.
- Hey, Ma.

1236
01:22:49,465 --> 01:22:54,052
Oh, you look so good. Oh, my God.

1237
01:23:01,477 --> 01:23:04,270
- You have clean teeth.
- I do! Look at my teeth!

1238
01:23:05,064 --> 01:23:06,982
I got new teeth. Everything.

1239
01:23:07,149 --> 01:23:08,441
How you think I look?

1240
01:23:08,609 --> 01:23:10,735
- Good.
- Yeah?

1241
01:23:23,582 --> 01:23:25,709
Cake and more cake.

1242
01:23:25,876 --> 01:23:28,420
- Ice cream?
- Ice cream and cake.

1243
01:23:28,587 --> 01:23:31,172
Ice cream and cake and cake. Right?

1244
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:34,467
Ice cream, cake and cake.
Ice cream, cake and cake...

1245
01:23:34,635 --> 01:23:36,219
Quacka!

1246
01:23:41,392 --> 01:23:42,892
Ma.

1247
01:23:55,823 --> 01:23:58,867
- They gave you some new teeth, huh?
- Yeah.

1248
01:24:03,289 --> 01:24:05,582
Hey, Georgie. What, they let
you outta the house now?

1249
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:08,251
- Yeah.
- Lettin' him outta the house, Ma?

1250
01:24:08,419 --> 01:24:10,462
Hey, look, I want you
to meet Sal Lonano.

1251
01:24:17,303 --> 01:24:19,262
How you doing, Dicky?

1252
01:24:21,307 --> 01:24:22,766
Let's spar.

1253
01:24:30,983 --> 01:24:32,442
Hey, Charlene.

1254
01:24:57,676 --> 01:24:59,302
Welcome back!

1255
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:02,472
It's supposed to be a surprise.
You're late.

1256
01:25:03,307 --> 01:25:05,433
- Hey.
- Hey.

1257
01:25:05,601 --> 01:25:09,062
Mick, I can't even tell you, being in
this smelly-ass locker room. You know?

1258
01:25:09,230 --> 01:25:11,856
Being back with you,
this is what got me through.

1259
01:25:12,024 --> 01:25:16,402
- You look good. Your eyes are clear.
- Yeah. You know...

1260
01:25:17,613 --> 01:25:20,323
...Alice says prison might've
been the best thing for me.

1261
01:25:20,491 --> 01:25:23,868
Got me clean. Got me clear. Up here.

1262
01:25:24,995 --> 01:25:26,955
It's a beautiful thing, Dick.

1263
01:25:28,707 --> 01:25:32,502
- I gotta talk to you about something.
- Yeah.

1264
01:25:32,670 --> 01:25:36,131
Look at this locker.
The old locker.

1265
01:25:36,298 --> 01:25:37,924
I love it. Fuckin' love it.

1266
01:25:39,969 --> 01:25:43,429
I made a promise to them
I wouldn't work with you again.

1267
01:25:53,274 --> 01:25:57,026
I had to. After everything
that happened, I'm sorry.

1268
01:26:01,949 --> 01:26:04,325
You stickin' to that?

1269
01:26:05,744 --> 01:26:10,331
I'm glad you're back. You look good.

1270
01:26:10,499 --> 01:26:13,751
I don't know what else to say.

1271
01:26:20,718 --> 01:26:23,011
- Mick, you fuckin' kidding me?
- No, I'm not.

1272
01:26:27,766 --> 01:26:30,727
- Oh, hey, Mick.
- Come on, come on!

1273
01:26:30,895 --> 01:26:34,939
You gotta... Ma. You gotta
do this at home. Please?

1274
01:26:35,107 --> 01:26:36,774
What are you talkin' about?
What's the matter?

1275
01:26:36,942 --> 01:26:38,985
Mom, please?

1276
01:26:39,153 --> 01:26:41,446
All right, girls. Let's pack it up.

1277
01:26:41,614 --> 01:26:43,072
I know. We'll see him at home.

1278
01:27:05,387 --> 01:27:07,722
- What the hell?
- Would you please pack it up?

1279
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:09,307
- Why?
- Let's get it put away.

1280
01:27:10,059 --> 01:27:12,852
If that's what Micky wants,
we're gonna put it away.

1281
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:15,230
- There's your brother.
- Dicky...

1282
01:27:15,397 --> 01:27:18,608
- How ya doing?
- Micky?

1283
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:25,740
That's nice. That's nice.

1284
01:27:25,908 --> 01:27:27,325
We've been working on it
for two weeks.

1285
01:27:27,493 --> 01:27:29,410
Sherri, come on, stop it.

1286
01:27:29,578 --> 01:27:30,995
All right, girls,
come on, let's go home.

1287
01:27:31,163 --> 01:27:33,498
It's not the time to do this,
obviously. Come on.

1288
01:27:33,666 --> 01:27:37,919
You stay here.
What the hell's going on?

1289
01:27:38,087 --> 01:27:40,588
- What's going on?
- We ain't gonna work together.

1290
01:27:41,632 --> 01:27:43,341
He don't want me to work with him.

1291
01:27:43,509 --> 01:27:45,593
What're you talking about?

1292
01:27:45,761 --> 01:27:47,804
That's not right.

1293
01:27:47,972 --> 01:27:51,432
Micky never would've won
Sanchez without Dicky.

1294
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,810
That's fuckin' bullshit! Take it back!

1295
01:27:53,978 --> 01:27:56,312
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Don't you fuckin'
talk to my mother that way.

1296
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:57,522
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

1297
01:27:57,690 --> 01:27:59,190
Take 'em home.

1298
01:28:01,235 --> 01:28:02,694
Why don't you ask Micky?

1299
01:28:03,612 --> 01:28:05,863
If we're gonna train, they gotta go.

1300
01:28:06,031 --> 01:28:07,949
They gotta go, Mick, come on.

1301
01:28:08,951 --> 01:28:12,620
Ask him, George. Ask him if he would've
won Sanchez without his brother?

1302
01:28:12,788 --> 01:28:14,455
Hey, take him outside, all right?

1303
01:28:16,667 --> 01:28:19,002
No, I wouldn't have won Sanchez
if it wasn't for Dicky.

1304
01:28:20,129 --> 01:28:21,296
How can you say that to O'Keefe?

1305
01:28:21,463 --> 01:28:22,964
Because it's true.

1306
01:28:23,799 --> 01:28:25,550
I went with that game plan,
it wasn't working.

1307
01:28:25,718 --> 01:28:27,719
So I went back to what
I learned with Dicky.

1308
01:28:27,886 --> 01:28:30,763
And I wouldn't have won without you,
either, O'Keefe, OK?

1309
01:28:31,598 --> 01:28:34,434
I mean, you know that.
We worked hard. You got me ready.

1310
01:28:34,601 --> 01:28:37,061
You got your confidence
and your focus from O'Keefe,

1311
01:28:37,229 --> 01:28:40,481
and from Sal and
your father and from me.

1312
01:28:42,067 --> 01:28:44,235
- Dicky's a junk bag.
- Hey.

1313
01:28:44,403 --> 01:28:45,528
He's a junk bag!

1314
01:28:45,696 --> 01:28:47,238
- Fuck you, Charlene.
- Fuck you.

1315
01:28:47,406 --> 01:28:48,823
- I'm eight months sober.
- Oh, yeah,

1316
01:28:48,991 --> 01:28:50,742
and I'm sure you're gonna need
something now that you're out.

1317
01:28:50,909 --> 01:28:52,702
"Oh, my back. Oh, my back."

1318
01:28:52,870 --> 01:28:55,163
- Fuck you always picking on me for?
- No, fuck you!

1319
01:28:55,331 --> 01:28:57,081
And what about O'Keefe?
We're in the same boat.

1320
01:28:57,249 --> 01:28:59,834
One day at a fucking time, right,
O'Keefe? You know what I mean?

1321
01:29:00,002 --> 01:29:01,377
What, it's all right
for him to be here?

1322
01:29:01,545 --> 01:29:03,880
Why am I the fuckin' problem?
I'm his blood, I'm his family!

1323
01:29:04,048 --> 01:29:06,049
- You are the problem!
- I'm the one fighting, OK?

1324
01:29:06,216 --> 01:29:08,676
Not you, not you, and not you.

1325
01:29:10,095 --> 01:29:12,013
- I know what I need.
- And you need Dicky?

1326
01:29:12,181 --> 01:29:13,723
I want Dicky back.

1327
01:29:14,933 --> 01:29:17,185
And I want you, Charlene.
And I want O'Keefe.

1328
01:29:17,353 --> 01:29:19,771
I want my family.
What's wrong with that?

1329
01:29:21,648 --> 01:29:23,608
It's not the deal we made, baby.

1330
01:29:23,776 --> 01:29:25,276
She's right, Micky.
That's not the deal.

1331
01:29:25,444 --> 01:29:29,364
It wasn't the deal.
Come on, you can't do this to us.

1332
01:29:29,531 --> 01:29:31,157
- You sound like them now.
- I sound like them now?

1333
01:29:31,325 --> 01:29:32,950
- Yeah, you sound like them.
- You sound like them.

1334
01:29:33,118 --> 01:29:34,535
How could I do this to you?
"You can't do that to us.

1335
01:29:34,703 --> 01:29:38,289
He can't do that to us."
You sound like them.

1336
01:29:38,457 --> 01:29:40,083
You should fuckin' listen to yourself.

1337
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:42,794
You sound like them and maybe
this is where you belong.

1338
01:29:42,961 --> 01:29:44,379
That's the way you love him?

1339
01:29:44,546 --> 01:29:46,547
- Charlene!
- Come on!

1340
01:29:46,715 --> 01:29:49,967
- You wanted your brother? Good luck.
- O'Keefe, come on.

1341
01:29:50,135 --> 01:29:52,804
- Mickey.
- Mickey.

1342
01:29:55,933 --> 01:29:58,434
Come on, everything
happens for a reason.

1343
01:29:59,269 --> 01:30:04,440
You know? Maybe it's for the best.
God has a plan.

1344
01:30:06,860 --> 01:30:08,653
Wanna spar with your brother?

1345
01:30:15,327 --> 01:30:17,495
Dick Eklund, pride of Lowell!

1346
01:30:18,414 --> 01:30:20,498
Watching that for years, huh?

1347
01:30:23,502 --> 01:30:24,544
Micky, Micky!

1348
01:30:24,711 --> 01:30:27,213
Whoa, hey!
What the hell are you doing?

1349
01:30:27,381 --> 01:30:28,631
Micky!

1350
01:30:28,799 --> 01:30:30,675
- Daddy! Daddy, Daddy!
- For crying out loud!

1351
01:30:30,843 --> 01:30:32,343
Take that baby out of here.

1352
01:30:32,511 --> 01:30:34,137
I told you take him away
ten minutes ago!

1353
01:30:35,097 --> 01:30:38,349
Sweetheart, you all right?
You OK? Your back?

1354
01:30:38,517 --> 01:30:41,811
What are you doing?
What's the matter with you?

1355
01:30:41,979 --> 01:30:45,690
Can this be my fight, Alice?
Just once?

1356
01:30:45,858 --> 01:30:49,360
Maybe just this one time
not for Dicky?

1357
01:30:49,528 --> 01:30:51,571
I know you think he's coming back.

1358
01:30:51,738 --> 01:30:53,614
He's 40 years old and doesn't
have a tooth in his head

1359
01:30:53,782 --> 01:30:56,451
- that's his fuckin' own.
- I'll go fuckin' ten rounds.

1360
01:30:56,618 --> 01:30:58,703
Let your brother talk
for a minute here, all right?

1361
01:30:58,871 --> 01:31:00,663
- What are you sayin', sweetheart?
- I'm Shea Neary...

1362
01:31:00,831 --> 01:31:03,875
Shut up before I bust your
fuckin' head open, Dicky.

1363
01:31:04,042 --> 01:31:06,919
- Hey, hey...
- What're you gonna do? I'm Shea Neary.

1364
01:31:07,087 --> 01:31:08,421
You want me to bust
your fuckin' head open?

1365
01:31:08,589 --> 01:31:09,964
Come on, come on! George, please!

1366
01:31:10,132 --> 01:31:12,216
- Dicky!
- Please! What are you saying?

1367
01:31:12,384 --> 01:31:15,845
- Tell me what you're saying.
- This is supposed to be my fight.

1368
01:31:16,013 --> 01:31:18,556
This is my shot at a title.
I won't get another one after this.

1369
01:31:18,724 --> 01:31:20,183
- Am I being selfish?
- No.

1370
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:23,102
Am I saying, "Micky, Micky, Micky?"
You know what? If I am, I'm sorry.

1371
01:31:23,270 --> 01:31:24,729
I thought I was fightin'
for the championship.

1372
01:31:24,897 --> 01:31:26,898
And I thought you
were my mother, too.

1373
01:31:28,233 --> 01:31:30,276
I am your mother.

1374
01:31:31,153 --> 01:31:32,737
Yeah, Ma.

1375
01:31:35,073 --> 01:31:39,243
Mick, I'm sorry. I had no idea
you felt like that, all right?

1376
01:31:39,411 --> 01:31:41,579
If I made mistakes,
I'm gonna be better.

1377
01:31:42,748 --> 01:31:47,084
I don't wanna hurt you.
I am so sorry. I'm sorry.

1378
01:31:52,925 --> 01:31:54,175
Dicky!

1379
01:31:54,343 --> 01:31:55,718
Stay with him.

1380
01:31:56,678 --> 01:32:00,431
Dicky... Dicky!

1381
01:32:05,979 --> 01:32:07,939
- Dicky!
- Gotta do something.

1382
01:32:08,106 --> 01:32:10,608
Dicky, wait, come on!

1383
01:32:10,776 --> 01:32:14,904
- Micky wants you! I want you!
- I gotta do something.

1384
01:32:15,072 --> 01:32:17,323
I know what that means.
Don't do this!

1385
01:32:45,769 --> 01:32:47,353
Hey, Chan.

1386
01:32:52,067 --> 01:32:54,569
- What's going on?
- Hey, Dicky.

1387
01:32:56,488 --> 01:32:57,905
Hey, Dicky's back!

1388
01:32:58,073 --> 01:32:59,657
Hey!

1389
01:33:01,660 --> 01:33:02,910
Look at you!

1390
01:33:03,078 --> 01:33:06,163
What's up, my boy?
How you doing? Good to see you, man.

1391
01:33:06,331 --> 01:33:09,834
- You look good. Welcome back.
- Yeah, you're looking good.

1392
01:33:10,002 --> 01:33:11,669
- Great.
- Good to see ya.

1393
01:33:11,837 --> 01:33:14,338
- Welcome home.
- Hi, honey.

1394
01:33:16,174 --> 01:33:18,467
What's up, man?
You're looking good.

1395
01:33:18,635 --> 01:33:20,928
- Wanna head upstairs?
- Dicky's back.

1396
01:33:21,096 --> 01:33:23,472
- Hi, Dicky. We're gonna party.
- Go upstairs, man?

1397
01:33:27,436 --> 01:33:30,271
- Go upstairs, take a while?
- We missed you!

1398
01:33:30,439 --> 01:33:33,691
- Let's go, buddy.
- Come on, Dicky.

1399
01:33:37,195 --> 01:33:41,157
- Make for a little party for you...
- Hey, come back.

1400
01:33:41,992 --> 01:33:44,410
- What the fuck's that all about?
- What the hell was that?

1401
01:34:00,385 --> 01:34:03,054
Charlene? It's Dicky.

1402
01:34:04,806 --> 01:34:07,058
Get off my porch,
you piece of shit.

1403
01:34:09,394 --> 01:34:11,062
How fuckin' dare you...

1404
01:34:12,481 --> 01:34:13,689
...cocksucker...

1405
01:34:14,483 --> 01:34:15,608
...fuckin'...

1406
01:34:19,071 --> 01:34:20,363
You're a fuckin' asshole, Dicky.

1407
01:34:20,530 --> 01:34:22,406
I want you off my fuckin' porch!

1408
01:34:22,574 --> 01:34:25,576
Why don't you just fuckin'
come down here and talk to me?

1409
01:34:25,744 --> 01:34:28,079
Such an asshole, coming to my
fucking house. You piece of shit!

1410
01:34:28,246 --> 01:34:29,747
- Standing on my porch...
- Charlene...

1411
01:34:29,915 --> 01:34:33,542
It's not fuckin' lady-like to be
shoutin' in the street like this.

1412
01:34:33,710 --> 01:34:35,419
You're such a fuckin' cocksucker
coming over here.

1413
01:34:35,587 --> 01:34:37,380
- Please?
- Oh, yeah, you think I fuckin' care?

1414
01:34:37,547 --> 01:34:40,758
- Come on, just fuckin'...
- Get off my fuckin' porch, Dicky!

1415
01:34:40,926 --> 01:34:44,804
Would you just fuckin'
come down here... and talk to me?

1416
01:34:54,398 --> 01:34:57,108
What kind of dog is that?
Is that a Cocker Spaniel?

1417
01:35:02,781 --> 01:35:04,448
All right, I know you
can't fuckin' stand me.

1418
01:35:04,616 --> 01:35:05,741
Really, what makes you say that?

1419
01:35:05,909 --> 01:35:09,370
I ain't got no use for you, either.
All right? But my brother loves ya.

1420
01:35:09,538 --> 01:35:11,664
And you can't just
run away because of me.

1421
01:35:11,832 --> 01:35:13,791
He don't deserve that. All right?

1422
01:35:13,959 --> 01:35:16,419
So I will quit if you want me to quit.

1423
01:35:16,586 --> 01:35:19,380
- You're full of shit.
- I swear to God.

1424
01:35:19,548 --> 01:35:21,465
I will quit if it means
you'll come back, all right?

1425
01:35:21,633 --> 01:35:23,259
But I want you to think about something.

1426
01:35:23,427 --> 01:35:26,429
Micky has a chance to do
something that I never did.

1427
01:35:26,596 --> 01:35:28,139
That in my time, I never had.

1428
01:35:28,306 --> 01:35:31,308
"Oh, yeah, my big chance
was with Sugar Ray Leonard.

1429
01:35:31,476 --> 01:35:33,394
I'm so great.
I'm the pride of fuckin' Lowell.

1430
01:35:33,562 --> 01:35:35,521
Oh, yeah, I fought Sugar Ray Leonard."
I've heard it.

1431
01:35:35,689 --> 01:35:36,897
I came here to make things right.

1432
01:35:37,065 --> 01:35:38,441
- OK, let's make things right.
- Yeah.

1433
01:35:38,608 --> 01:35:42,862
Number one: You didn't knock down
Sugar Ray Leonard. He tripped.

1434
01:35:44,489 --> 01:35:47,116
I was in the ring. Don't you think
I know what really happened that day?

1435
01:35:47,284 --> 01:35:50,578
All right? What have you
ever done with your life?

1436
01:35:50,746 --> 01:35:52,747
- I like my life.
- Yeah, what you ever done with it?

1437
01:35:52,914 --> 01:35:55,624
- I like my life now, Dicky.
- What have you done with your life?

1438
01:35:55,792 --> 01:35:57,168
You're a college dropout, Charlene.

1439
01:35:57,335 --> 01:36:00,129
You're just a little bar girl.
Your life sucks.

1440
01:36:01,590 --> 01:36:04,633
All right. I drank too much.

1441
01:36:04,801 --> 01:36:06,844
I worked in a lot of bars.

1442
01:36:07,012 --> 01:36:09,972
And I ruined a lot of opportunities, but
I'm trying to do something better here.

1443
01:36:10,140 --> 01:36:12,516
- And so is Micky.
- And so am I.

1444
01:36:14,311 --> 01:36:19,148
And he needs me. You heard him.
And I know he needs you.

1445
01:36:22,235 --> 01:36:24,361
What is that blue shit on your arm?

1446
01:36:25,530 --> 01:36:27,198
It's icing.

1447
01:36:30,368 --> 01:36:34,705
OK. I'll see ya in Micky's corner.
Otherwise, go fuck yourself.

1448
01:36:34,873 --> 01:36:36,791
- It's a deal.
- All right? It's a deal.

1449
01:36:49,346 --> 01:36:51,597
We worked it out for you. Ask her.

1450
01:36:53,266 --> 01:36:56,852
Good. Go get O'Keefe back, too.

1451
01:36:57,896 --> 01:36:59,647
I will.

1452
01:37:04,903 --> 01:37:05,986
Hey, Mick...

1453
01:37:08,406 --> 01:37:11,826
You think I knocked down
Sugar Ray Leonard?

1454
01:37:11,993 --> 01:37:15,746
Went ten rounds. One of the best
ever and he couldn't hurt you.

1455
01:37:15,914 --> 01:37:17,832
You were my hero.

1456
01:37:18,458 --> 01:37:20,251
I was.

1457
01:37:21,795 --> 01:37:23,337
I was.

1458
01:37:28,510 --> 01:37:30,511
I'm sorry.

1459
01:37:30,679 --> 01:37:32,263
You are?

1460
01:38:50,175 --> 01:38:52,259
There's a press conference downstairs.

1461
01:38:53,136 --> 01:38:54,678
Come on, let's go.

1462
01:38:55,180 --> 01:38:56,305
Spot of tea, mate!

1463
01:38:56,473 --> 01:39:00,601
Neary: Ten stone... six pound.

1464
01:39:07,233 --> 01:39:11,320
Ward: Ten stone... six pound.

1465
01:39:12,447 --> 01:39:15,199
Hey, Micky, Micky Ward!
We have a question over here.

1466
01:39:17,452 --> 01:39:20,371
- How you been training?
- I train, I train hard.

1467
01:39:20,538 --> 01:39:22,790
Shea's 22 and 0.
He's never been knocked down.

1468
01:39:22,958 --> 01:39:25,250
- That's gonna change tomorrow.
- In fact, we expected

1469
01:39:25,418 --> 01:39:26,669
a much better fighter.

1470
01:39:27,545 --> 01:39:29,421
I'm just grateful to be here
and have the opportunity.

1471
01:39:29,589 --> 01:39:31,048
Thank you guys for the shot.

1472
01:39:31,216 --> 01:39:35,302
Shea, who do you respect as a fighter?
And who would you like to fight next?

1473
01:39:36,554 --> 01:39:38,847
I plan on moving right
through Micky Ward tomorrow.

1474
01:39:39,015 --> 01:39:41,058
Moving on to other great fighters,
like Gatti.

1475
01:39:41,226 --> 01:39:43,477
Yeah, I believe Gatti and I
would make a great match.

1476
01:39:43,645 --> 01:39:45,145
Are you scared, Mr. Ward?

1477
01:39:58,243 --> 01:40:01,495
And now, ladies and
gentlemen, 12 rounds of boxing

1478
01:40:01,663 --> 01:40:07,292
for the WBU Welterweight
Championship of the World!

1479
01:40:11,256 --> 01:40:12,339
I can't see!

1480
01:40:13,883 --> 01:40:17,261
Here I go again on my own

1481
01:40:18,930 --> 01:40:22,516
Goin' down the only road
I've ever known

1482
01:40:24,185 --> 01:40:28,439
Like a drifter
I was born to walk alone

1483
01:40:29,816 --> 01:40:33,360
- Hey, fellas, let's go.
- I made up my mind

1484
01:40:35,947 --> 01:40:38,782
I ain't wasting no more time

1485
01:40:40,201 --> 01:40:44,621
Here I go again on my own

1486
01:40:45,790 --> 01:40:49,460
Going down the only road
I've ever known

1487
01:40:51,087 --> 01:40:54,673
Like a drifter I was born
to walk alone

1488
01:40:54,841 --> 01:40:56,800
Don't listen to 'em, Mick.

1489
01:40:57,719 --> 01:41:00,304
I made up my mind

1490
01:41:02,766 --> 01:41:05,976
I ain't wasting no more time...

1491
01:41:09,981 --> 01:41:12,191
And there is Micky Ward
of Lowell, Massachusetts,

1492
01:41:12,358 --> 01:41:15,736
entering the ring. It's his
first fight outside the United States.

1493
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:21,909
Micky Ward: 30 wins, seven losses.
He's gotten better recently, 20 KOs.

1494
01:41:23,244 --> 01:41:26,789
And now Ward awaits his
opponent, Shea Neary.

1495
01:41:26,956 --> 01:41:31,710
Neary regards himself
as the European Arturo Gatti.

1496
01:41:31,878 --> 01:41:34,505
Meaning that he is a head-on,
high-contact fighter

1497
01:41:34,672 --> 01:41:37,508
who throws 70 punches per round.

1498
01:41:39,052 --> 01:41:40,677
Neary's from Liverpool
and should have

1499
01:41:40,845 --> 01:41:42,805
a huge following here tonight.

1500
01:41:44,724 --> 01:41:49,186
Accompanied
by Paint the Town Red by The Mahones.

1501
01:41:49,354 --> 01:41:52,773
Neary is the current
Welterweight Champion of the World.

1502
01:41:52,941 --> 01:41:56,527
He is a very tough young man.
Beyond dedicated.

1503
01:41:56,694 --> 01:42:00,531
Lives a Spartan existence.
And according to his promoters,

1504
01:42:00,698 --> 01:42:05,035
does nothing but eat,
drink, think, fantasize...

1505
01:42:05,203 --> 01:42:07,579
...dream of fighting.

1506
01:42:07,747 --> 01:42:11,375
Shea Neary has had 22
professional fights and won them all.

1507
01:42:11,543 --> 01:42:13,544
Seventeen KOs.

1508
01:42:23,847 --> 01:42:27,432
Come out when you hear the bell.
Don't piss about. Shake hands.

1509
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:31,603
Both of ya... shake hands!

1510
01:42:31,771 --> 01:42:35,566
As close as we just saw
them in the middle of the ring,

1511
01:42:35,733 --> 01:42:38,068
- forehead to forehead,
- Did you see that?

1512
01:42:38,236 --> 01:42:43,824
That's how close we expect them to be
for as long as this fight goes on.

1513
01:42:43,992 --> 01:42:45,909
Ward is a long ways from home.

1514
01:42:46,077 --> 01:42:47,744
Don't coast in a foreign country.

1515
01:42:47,912 --> 01:42:49,621
Well, the big challenge for Ward

1516
01:42:49,789 --> 01:42:52,749
is to get off to a faster start
than is customary for him.

1517
01:42:52,917 --> 01:42:56,461
Micky Ward, a notoriously
slow starter in big fights,

1518
01:42:56,629 --> 01:42:59,047
Shea Neary, an ultra-fast starter.

1519
01:42:59,215 --> 01:43:01,425
And that's the question
that hovers over round one.

1520
01:43:01,593 --> 01:43:03,093
Will Ward be ready for the fight?

1521
01:43:03,261 --> 01:43:06,638
Already, Shea Neary starts
taking it to him on the ropes!

1522
01:43:06,806 --> 01:43:09,933
And Neary going to the body,
which is Ward's specialty.

1523
01:43:11,269 --> 01:43:13,437
Neary bangs Ward to the body.

1524
01:43:13,605 --> 01:43:15,439
And a big uppercut by Neary.

1525
01:43:15,607 --> 01:43:17,774
Neary leads off with a good left jab.

1526
01:43:17,942 --> 01:43:19,860
- Come on, Micky!
- Keeps Ward off balance,

1527
01:43:20,028 --> 01:43:21,403
jabbing here and there.

1528
01:43:23,448 --> 01:43:27,576
There's a good left hook
by Neary as he stepped in on Ward.

1529
01:43:27,744 --> 01:43:32,623
Ward not able to deal with him very well
when Neary stands at range like this.

1530
01:43:32,790 --> 01:43:34,750
- Come on!
- That's it! Get him!

1531
01:43:34,918 --> 01:43:37,461
And a left hook
lands up top from Micky Ward.

1532
01:43:38,630 --> 01:43:40,464
Neary digging his
own right hand to the body.

1533
01:43:40,632 --> 01:43:42,591
They trade shots at close range.

1534
01:43:43,927 --> 01:43:46,303
Ward, he's trying
to match Neary blow for blow

1535
01:43:46,471 --> 01:43:51,767
and now Neary starts to come on and
take the last 30 seconds of the round...

1536
01:43:51,935 --> 01:43:53,101
How about that?

1537
01:43:53,269 --> 01:43:54,478
Break!

1538
01:43:55,730 --> 01:43:58,565
Tremendous barrage in
the first minute. Just look at this.

1539
01:43:58,733 --> 01:44:02,277
- Unbelievable.
- What a great round one!

1540
01:44:02,445 --> 01:44:06,198
Ward is gonna have
to pick up the tempo

1541
01:44:06,366 --> 01:44:08,450
and beat him with volumes of punching.

1542
01:44:08,618 --> 01:44:11,703
No doubt, Neary is a better boxer.

1543
01:44:14,165 --> 01:44:19,002
Four hard right hands...
Neary has belted in the last minute.

1544
01:44:19,170 --> 01:44:22,506
Quicker than Ward,
more assertive than Ward,

1545
01:44:22,674 --> 01:44:24,299
surer of what he wants to do.

1546
01:44:24,467 --> 01:44:27,094
They're standing and trading shots
at the center of the ring.

1547
01:44:27,262 --> 01:44:29,137
Ward's gonna have
to step it up a little bit more

1548
01:44:29,305 --> 01:44:30,389
than he is right now.

1549
01:44:30,556 --> 01:44:32,349
Micky Ward's corner
taking a real deep look

1550
01:44:32,517 --> 01:44:33,767
at what's going on now.

1551
01:44:33,935 --> 01:44:37,562
And his family at ringside well aware
he's stepping up in class.

1552
01:44:37,730 --> 01:44:40,649
Ward has fallen to the pedal.
He's gotta be more aggressive.

1553
01:44:40,817 --> 01:44:42,985
He can't just try to wait
until everything is perfect.

1554
01:44:43,152 --> 01:44:46,113
His dominance over Micky Ward
is increasing as the fight goes on

1555
01:44:46,281 --> 01:44:50,617
because his technical plan
was the right one and he's executing it.

1556
01:44:50,785 --> 01:44:54,496
Punches like these make it seem...

1557
01:44:55,331 --> 01:44:58,000
...that it's now Neary's fight.

1558
01:44:59,502 --> 01:45:01,378
Ward hasn't been in this kind of war

1559
01:45:01,546 --> 01:45:04,006
with this strong of fighter as Neary.

1560
01:45:05,717 --> 01:45:09,636
They are trying
to hurt each other with every punch.

1561
01:45:09,804 --> 01:45:14,266
They've tested each other's will,
now they're testing each other's skill.

1562
01:45:14,434 --> 01:45:17,686
And Ward wobbled there
by a right cross from Neary!

1563
01:45:17,854 --> 01:45:20,397
Ward hurting now. His legs are gone.

1564
01:45:20,565 --> 01:45:24,109
Neary goes to the body
as he tries to finish Micky.

1565
01:45:25,361 --> 01:45:27,404
Vicious body shots from Neary.

1566
01:45:27,572 --> 01:45:31,074
And Ward still doesn't
even try to move off the ropes!

1567
01:45:31,242 --> 01:45:33,410
I don't know if he can, Jim.

1568
01:45:33,578 --> 01:45:35,579
He's waiting for Neary
to punch himself out.

1569
01:45:35,747 --> 01:45:38,457
Down goes Micky Ward! He may be out.

1570
01:45:38,624 --> 01:45:39,875
That ain't fuckin' it!

1571
01:45:40,043 --> 01:45:43,378
- One... two...
- Come on! That's it!

1572
01:45:44,756 --> 01:45:48,216
- That's my boy!
- Forward! Forward! Come on!

1573
01:45:50,011 --> 01:45:52,137
Ward is out on his feet.

1574
01:45:52,305 --> 01:45:55,265
Loser! Go back to America!

1575
01:45:55,433 --> 01:45:58,769
- This could be it for Micky Ward.
- Dicky, give him the fuckin' stool.

1576
01:45:58,936 --> 01:46:00,937
Charlene, will you get
the fuck outta here.

1577
01:46:01,105 --> 01:46:03,148
He needs to fuckin' sit down!

1578
01:46:03,816 --> 01:46:06,401
His brother's got
Ward jumping to wake up his legs.

1579
01:46:08,279 --> 01:46:12,240
I think this could be Ward's last chance
to turn this fight around.

1580
01:46:12,408 --> 01:46:14,451
It's Micky Ward
against the aggressiveness

1581
01:46:14,619 --> 01:46:16,578
and clean punching of Shea Neary.

1582
01:46:17,747 --> 01:46:20,957
If you don't have your defense up,
you can really get hurt.

1583
01:46:21,125 --> 01:46:23,251
He's making it very
difficult for Micky Ward.

1584
01:46:23,419 --> 01:46:26,004
I don't think he's gonna
get into it at this rate.

1585
01:46:26,172 --> 01:46:28,340
This is a survival mode...

1586
01:46:28,508 --> 01:46:32,302
Are you like me? Was just
good enough to fight Sugar Ray?

1587
01:46:32,470 --> 01:46:33,970
Never had to win, did I?

1588
01:46:34,138 --> 01:46:37,307
You gotta do more in there.
You gotta win a title.

1589
01:46:37,475 --> 01:46:40,435
For you, for me, for Lowell.

1590
01:46:40,603 --> 01:46:43,355
This is your time, all right?
You take it.

1591
01:46:43,523 --> 01:46:45,440
I had my time and I blew it.
You don't have to.

1592
01:46:45,608 --> 01:46:47,359
All right?
You fuckin' get out there,

1593
01:46:47,527 --> 01:46:49,528
and use all the shit
that you've been through,

1594
01:46:49,695 --> 01:46:51,571
all the shit we've gone through
over the fuckin' years

1595
01:46:51,739 --> 01:46:54,741
and you put it in that ring right now.
This is yours. This is fuckin' yours.

1596
01:46:54,909 --> 01:46:57,828
OK. Fuckin' head, body, head, body.

1597
01:46:57,995 --> 01:46:59,579
Say it back to me.
Fuckin' say it back to me.

1598
01:46:59,747 --> 01:47:01,289
- Head, body, head, body.
- Head, body, head, body.

1599
01:47:01,457 --> 01:47:04,084
Get in your mind this is
fucking yours. Fuckin' do it.

1600
01:47:04,252 --> 01:47:06,044
Stay off the fuckin' ropes.

1601
01:47:11,008 --> 01:47:13,176
If I'm in Micky Ward's corner tonight,

1602
01:47:13,344 --> 01:47:16,054
I thinking if he doesn't pick things up
this round and get going,

1603
01:47:16,222 --> 01:47:18,807
he'll just get totally wiped out.

1604
01:47:20,518 --> 01:47:22,602
Off the ropes!
Get off the ropes, Mick!

1605
01:47:23,980 --> 01:47:26,690
Once again, Ward against
the ropes as Neary is free to attack.

1606
01:47:26,858 --> 01:47:29,443
What are you doing? Come on, Mick!

1607
01:47:30,194 --> 01:47:33,029
Sometimes if you wanna win,
you gotta be something that you're not.

1608
01:47:33,197 --> 01:47:34,865
Come on!

1609
01:47:35,867 --> 01:47:38,118
Off the fuckin' ropes, Mick,
that ain't it!

1610
01:47:38,286 --> 01:47:40,162
Neary continues to pound away.

1611
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:48,378
Don't take no abuse!
This is your time Micky! It's up to you!

1612
01:47:48,546 --> 01:47:51,715
- Two big misses by Neary!
- That's it! That's it!

1613
01:47:51,883 --> 01:47:55,177
Ward seemingly getting his legs back.

1614
01:47:55,344 --> 01:47:57,387
He backs Neary off.

1615
01:47:57,555 --> 01:47:59,306
- Ward trades his way back.
- That's it!

1616
01:47:59,474 --> 01:48:01,933
Ward nods as if to say,
"Come on!"

1617
01:48:02,518 --> 01:48:04,060
"Come on, let's fight!"

1618
01:48:04,228 --> 01:48:05,979
Just imagine if you bought a ticket.

1619
01:48:06,147 --> 01:48:08,398
Closer and closer to Neary's ribcage.

1620
01:48:08,566 --> 01:48:11,234
This is becoming Micky Ward's fight.

1621
01:48:11,402 --> 01:48:13,361
And a left hook to the body
and an uppercut lands

1622
01:48:13,529 --> 01:48:15,864
- and now he backs Neary off.
- Head, body, head fuckin' body!

1623
01:48:17,366 --> 01:48:19,576
Ward hurt Neary with a body shot.

1624
01:48:19,744 --> 01:48:22,370
Ward hurts him again
with that left to the body.

1625
01:48:22,538 --> 01:48:26,208
Oh, and that one plants
Neary on his butt.

1626
01:48:26,375 --> 01:48:28,919
First time in 23 professional fights

1627
01:48:29,086 --> 01:48:32,172
- that Shea Neary has been down.
- This is it! This is it!

1628
01:48:32,340 --> 01:48:34,883
This is it, Micky!

1629
01:48:35,051 --> 01:48:38,094
Keep going! Don't look at me for it!
Take it to him!

1630
01:48:40,598 --> 01:48:44,935
- Come on, Micky, get in there!
- Ward lands a huge left hook!

1631
01:48:45,102 --> 01:48:47,854
As Micky Ward pounds away!

1632
01:48:48,022 --> 01:48:51,691
Goes to the body with the left hook!
Lands the uppercut again!

1633
01:48:51,859 --> 01:48:53,777
Neary down for the second time.

1634
01:48:53,945 --> 01:48:55,946
Mickey Vann's gonna stop it there.

1635
01:48:56,113 --> 01:49:00,534
"Irish" Micky Ward
with a big eight-round TKO!

1636
01:49:01,285 --> 01:49:02,577
He's done it again.

1637
01:49:04,372 --> 01:49:05,539
He's done it again.

1638
01:49:05,706 --> 01:49:10,669
The grinding, gutty Micky Ward
pulls out another big victory!

1639
01:49:23,516 --> 01:49:26,893
You're the champion of the world, Mick!
You're the fuckin' champ of the world!

1640
01:49:27,979 --> 01:49:29,688
You fuckin' did it!

1641
01:49:37,947 --> 01:49:40,365
Oh, you're the best!

1642
01:49:40,533 --> 01:49:45,161
- Oh, I love you!
- My boy's the champion of the world!

1643
01:49:46,038 --> 01:49:47,539
I love you!

1644
01:50:18,029 --> 01:50:21,364
This town always said,
you're a fuckin' boxer, right?

1645
01:50:21,532 --> 01:50:25,452
He thought he was a piece of shit. He
put Lowell back on the map, you know?

1646
01:50:25,620 --> 01:50:26,870
- We.
- I tell ya...

1647
01:50:27,038 --> 01:50:29,247
- We.
- No, but hold on.

1648
01:50:29,415 --> 01:50:31,333
Who used to be the pride of Lowell?

1649
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:33,877
Right here.
Who's the pride of Lowell now?

1650
01:50:34,045 --> 01:50:36,921
Right there.
That's how it's meant to be, you know?

1651
01:50:37,089 --> 01:50:38,882
Handin' it down to him.

1652
01:50:39,050 --> 01:50:42,552
Nothin' better than that.
Nothin' better than that.

1653
01:50:42,720 --> 01:50:46,264
He did it. I gotta go.
I gotta go.

1654
01:51:15,002 --> 01:51:18,254
Oh, look at cabbage head. Boo Boo!
Quacka!

1655
01:51:21,133 --> 01:51:23,677
- What's up buddy?
- Boo, where's your teeth?

1656
01:51:23,844 --> 01:51:27,013
Oh, I'm under arrest!
Let's go, move it out!

1657
01:51:29,225 --> 01:51:30,600
It's been real, ain't it?

1658
01:51:30,768 --> 01:51:34,145
It's been real, it's been unreal.
It's been a great experience.

1659
01:51:34,313 --> 01:51:36,231
Just glad it's done, finally,

1660
01:51:36,399 --> 01:51:39,442
and thanks to everyone so much,
from the bottom of my heart.

1661
01:51:39,610 --> 01:51:41,945
Thanks so much,
all you Hollywood people.

1662
01:51:42,113 --> 01:51:44,948
Now you know what I mean
when I say I can't get a word in.

1663
01:51:45,116 --> 01:51:47,742
I'm telling ya.
He'll never get a word in.

1664
01:51:47,910 --> 01:51:49,452
- All right, thank you.
- Thank you.

1665
01:51:49,620 --> 01:51:51,621
Thanks, everybody.
