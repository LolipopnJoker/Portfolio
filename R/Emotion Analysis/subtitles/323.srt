1
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:38,746
The oldest stories ever told
are written in the stars.

2
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:45,919
Stories of time before man and
gods, when Titans ruled the earth.

3
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,505
The Titans were powerful...

4
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:51,717
but their reign was ended
by their own sons...

5
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:56,889
Zeus, Poseidon and Hades.

6
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:00,476
Zeus convinced his
brother Hades...

7
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:04,605
to create a beast so strong it
could defeat their parents.

8
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,648
And from his own flesh...

9
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:11,195
Hades gave birth to an
unspeakable horror...

10
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,280
the Kraken.

11
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:23,540
Zeus became king of the heavens.

12
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:27,795
Poseidon, king of the seas.

13
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:31,340
And Hades, tricked by Zeus...

14
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:36,762
was left to rule the underworld
in darkness and in misery.

15
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:41,266
It was Zeus who created man...

16
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:45,604
and man's prayers fed
the gods' immortality.

17
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:52,861
But in time, mankind
grew restless.

18
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:55,155
They began to question the gods...

19
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:59,368
and, finally, rise
up against them.

20
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:09,336
Into this world, a child was born.

21
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:13,048
A boy who would change everything.

22
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,129
Perseus.

23
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,287
What is it, son?

24
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,040
I'll have a brother
or a sister soon.

25
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,548
Think we're gonna love
this child differently

26
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:34,338
to the way we love you? We won't.

27
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,674
This child will be yours.

28
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,509
Me...

29
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,386
I'm no one's son.

30
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,973
I am your father, Perseus.
Marmara is your mother.

31
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:48,936
And you'll always be our son.

32
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:53,857
The bond between us is much
more than flesh and bone.

33
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,943
The love we have for you...

34
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:00,989
it's that love that gods
and kings fight over.

35
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,533
I've never understood the gods.

36
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:06,536
But even I don't question that
you were saved for a reason.

37
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,997
And some day...

38
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:14,336
that reason is gonna take
you far away from here.

39
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:16,838
But not tonight?

40
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,987
Perseus. Perseus.

41
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:42,364
Getting frail, old man.

42
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:45,117
Marmara. Marmara.

43
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:53,250
Another day, nothing.

44
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,003
Caught on the reef.

45
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,548
To whom do I direct our gratitude
for this glorious bounty?

46
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,008
Spyros, please.

47
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:04,428
Poseidon, Zeus? Who
do I thank, Marmara?

48
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:07,431
- Thank the men who provoke them.
- They crush my island.

49
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,725
They put a plague on yours.

50
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:12,436
They take from us what they
want. We're their slaves.

51
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,062
The gods gave us life.

52
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,395
For that, we should be thankful.

53
00:05:16,396 --> 00:05:18,817
I'm tired of being
thankful for scraps.

54
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,528
I'm a fisherman. Perseus
is a fisherman.

55
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:24,990
They've even taken that
away from us. What we are.

56
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,451
Still they want us
to love them anyway.

57
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:29,786
One day...

58
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,414
somebody's gonna have
to make a stand.

59
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,916
One day, somebody's
gonna have to say:

60
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,376
"Enough."

61
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:10,410
Just like the day you came to me.

62
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:16,625
The storm brought me right to you.

63
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:24,007
I know you have questions, son.

64
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,968
I wish I had the answers.

65
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,517
I have everything I need...

66
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,560
right here.

67
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:40,774
Good night, son.

68
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,627
Hold her steady.

69
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,546
Tekla, the wreath.

70
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,256
Fetch the wreath.

71
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:07,425
The statue of Zeus. Magnificent.

72
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,357
Something isn't right.

73
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,194
The soldiers, what are they doing?

74
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:31,783
Come on.

75
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,493
Lift it.

76
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,789
Hang on.

77
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,464
In the name of the king and queen.

78
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,633
Who are they?

79
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,719
Soldiers from Argos.

80
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:53,388
What have they done?

81
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:57,058
They've declared war.
War against the gods.

82
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,416
- Let's turn the boat around.
- No.

83
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,001
Do nothing.

84
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,758
Behind you.

85
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,365
Hold on.

86
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,997
Tekla.

87
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:02,290
Where's the boy?

88
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,131
Tekla.

89
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,118
No.

90
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,997
- Go.
- No.

91
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,396
No.

92
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:13,069
Zeus, you must bring an end to
this. They attack our temples.

93
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,864
Now they dare to
desecrate Zeus' image.

94
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,365
We could reach out to them.

95
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,159
An accommodation could
be made. A truce.

96
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,119
No.

97
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,584
I created them...

98
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:31,838
and they reward my
love with defiance?

99
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,299
There will be no truce.

100
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,426
Finally.

101
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,553
Some rage from you.

102
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,850
How long has it been?

103
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,227
How long, brother...

104
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:49,189
since you've seen my face?

105
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,441
Hades.

106
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:03,411
Endless years, I've watched
from the underworld...

107
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:08,750
and saw your wrath
tempered with love.

108
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,252
You created them for one reason...

109
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:16,800
so their prayers would
fuel our immortality.

110
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,511
But you love them too well.

111
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:21,179
They've grown strong.

112
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:26,601
And now I am forced to rise
because we are all threatened.

113
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,686
What do you want, brother?

114
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,773
Let me loose upon them.

115
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,776
They will pray again...

116
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:38,113
and you will bathe in
their awe and fear.

117
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,199
And we will grow strong again.

118
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,618
He belongs in the
underworld, not here.

119
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,079
You do not tell me where I belong.

120
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,751
You say it is love that feeds us.

121
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,505
But you depend on their love.

122
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:58,466
I've only learned to
live on their fear...

123
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,010
their pain.

124
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:05,598
Zeus, our brother speaks
the truth. Hear him.

125
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,441
Go. Do what you will.

126
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:15,984
Father, we need the mortals.

127
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,485
No, Apollo.

128
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,112
Hades is right.

129
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,865
Their insolence has a price.

130
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:25,994
Like children, they need to be
reminded of the order of things.

131
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,329
Set an example, brother.

132
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,331
Turn them on each other...

133
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,209
and back into our arms.

134
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,670
- Are we the last boat to come in?
- No, captain.

135
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:20,048
You're the only one.

136
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,592
Is he one of ours?

137
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,386
No. We found him off
Paxos amongst our dead.

138
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,055
He was the only survivor.

139
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,974
Let the palace figure out
what to do with him.

140
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,769
Squad by four.

141
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,979
Go on.

142
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,233
Because if we show
the gods our love...

143
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,693
they shall show us love
in return. They shall.

144
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:43,404
They gave us the corn in the
fields, the sun in the sky.

145
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,156
These are all gifts given to us.

146
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,659
Gifts can be taken away.
This will be taken away...

147
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:49,577
if we do not pay love to our gods.

148
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,715
If we do not, we stay
in filth and misery,

149
00:13:51,716 --> 00:13:53,456
which we have brought
upon ourselves.

150
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,334
- Move. Out of the way.
- Our gods, we beg for the whip...

151
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,379
The beauty and clarity
of servitude.

152
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:03,299
Man cannot rule man. You defy the
gods and you will be punished.

153
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,716
Is this all there is?

154
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,927
We lost many men, Your Majesty...

155
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,929
but we have victory.

156
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:55,685
To King Kepheus. To
Queen Cassiopeia.

157
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:00,857
No.

158
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,362
To you...

159
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,032
our mighty legion.

160
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,832
Our heroes who have
dared to strike

161
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,953
a blow at the heart of Zeus.

162
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,042
The temples are burning.

163
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,502
The statues have fallen.

164
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,088
We have starved them
of our prayers.

165
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:25,757
Tonight...

166
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:28,301
after a generation of struggle...

167
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:31,137
the sun does not set
over the ocean.

168
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:34,599
It sets on Olympus itself.

169
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,352
A new era has begun.

170
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:40,355
The era of man.

171
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,067
That frown doesn't
suit you, Andromeda.

172
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:47,278
Have something to drink.
You'll feel more lively.

173
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,617
Andromeda.

174
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,586
What's your name?

175
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:05,588
Perseus.

176
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:09,217
Take this.

177
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,594
Please drink.

178
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,891
- Hands off.
- Enough.

179
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,894
Our daughter, the missionary.

180
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,816
Have you seen what's
happening out there?

181
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,193
Have you even bothered to look?

182
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,445
We serve as an inspiration.

183
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:32,782
Hundreds of our men have
lost their lives...

184
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,410
yet we celebrate.

185
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,500
You provoke the
gods and you act as

186
00:16:37,501 --> 00:16:38,996
if there will be no consequence.

187
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,165
Well, what do you want?
Should we be afraid?

188
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:45,503
Should we be trembling and
soiling ourselves in fear?

189
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,213
The gods need us.

190
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,673
They need our worship.

191
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,884
What do we need of them?

192
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:54,637
- Look at my daughter.
- Don't.

193
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,849
What could be more
divine than her face?

194
00:16:58,016 --> 00:17:00,560
More beautiful than all
the women of Greece.

195
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:03,283
More beautiful than
Aphrodite herself.

196
00:17:03,284 --> 00:17:05,314
The Olympians should envy her.

197
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,213
We are the gods now.

198
00:17:07,214 --> 00:17:10,361
My queen. You're
making a spectacle.

199
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,699
Interesting.

200
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,868
You.

201
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:21,140
You are specks of dust
beneath our fingernails.

202
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:24,602
Your very breath is a
gift from Olympus.

203
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,439
You have insulted powers
beyond your comprehension.

204
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,149
Who are you?

205
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:34,445
I am Hades.

206
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,033
Kneel.

207
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,334
Not now, Perseus.

208
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,294
You will have your chance.

209
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,554
What do you know of beauty?

210
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:02,682
What is more beautiful than death?

211
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:10,314
Gaze upon me, mortal queen.

212
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,492
- Mother.
- Princess.

213
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,917
In 10 days...

214
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:33,296
when the sun is eclipsed...

215
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,757
I will unleash the Kraken.

216
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,094
Argos will be swept
from the earth...

217
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:43,431
and all of you with it.

218
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,851
Unless...

219
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,062
you sacrifice the princess...

220
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:53,274
you so foolishly
compare to the gods.

221
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,527
Only her blood will
sate the Kraken...

222
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,779
and Zeus...

223
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:02,783
who you have so offended.

224
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,539
Choose your penance, Argos.

225
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,626
Destruction or sacrifice.

226
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,920
This is the will of Zeus.

227
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:18,966
The will of your father.

228
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:35,149
There is a demigod in Argos.

229
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,028
That is impossible.

230
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:41,197
He's yours.

231
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,867
His name is Perseus.

232
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,411
We could offer him sanctuary.

233
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,998
Have I heard his prayers?

234
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,335
This son knows no love for me.

235
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,694
He's no different from
any of the others

236
00:20:56,695 --> 00:20:58,422
who have turned their backs on us.

237
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:02,510
For the last time, demigod, speak.

238
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:06,681
- I'm not a demigod.
- Who are you? Why were you sent?

239
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,474
I don't know.

240
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,733
I advise against this, sire.

241
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,095
He's not to be trusted.

242
00:21:19,096 --> 00:21:20,861
What would you have me do? Draco.

243
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,700
Leave him.

244
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,248
Is it possible?

245
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:35,668
If it's true you are
the son of Zeus...

246
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,712
you can save us.

247
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,757
You must save us.

248
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:44,427
I can't save you. I'm just a man.

249
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:48,222
My lord, as terrible as it
is to utter the words...

250
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,099
a sacrifice is the only way.

251
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,018
Don't even say the word.

252
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:53,602
He's right.

253
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,689
No one should have to die for me.

254
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,150
Let Perseus go.

255
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:03,904
Sire, we need to get the
princess out of the city now.

256
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:06,907
- I'll find a place to hide her.
- You can't hide from Hades.

257
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:09,452
So says the bastard son of a god.

258
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,208
My father...

259
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:18,753
was killed by a god.

260
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:23,340
My mother, sister...

261
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:27,803
everyone I loved was
killed by a god.

262
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,806
I mend nets...

263
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,933
not wield a sword.

264
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,487
So, demigod, you have a visitor.

265
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,948
She says she knows you.

266
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:54,205
My name is Io, Perseus.

267
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,332
And how do you know me?

268
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,876
I've watched you all your life.

269
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,629
I guided you to your family.

270
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:06,467
Are you a god?

271
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,302
There are gods and
there are men...

272
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,972
and there are those of
us who are in between.

273
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,432
Many years ago...

274
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,228
I refused a god's advance.

275
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:19,396
I was cursed with agelessness.

276
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:22,108
That's not much of a curse.

277
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:25,528
I've lived for years
watching my loved ones die.

278
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:28,572
I imagine you're sympathetic
to that plight.

279
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,329
Is it true?

280
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,083
Am I the son of Zeus?

281
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:41,210
Yes.

282
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:47,341
The story of your birth began with
the rebellion of King Acrisius.

283
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:54,557
Mankind had grown tired of the
gods' mistreatment and cruelty.

284
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:58,769
Acrisius led a siege on Olympus.

285
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,397
It is said the other gods...

286
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:05,359
wanted to simply lay waste
to Acrisius and his army...

287
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,320
but Zeus loved man too much.

288
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:13,117
Instead, he chose to make
an example of Acrisius.

289
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:17,872
He disguised himself
as the king...

290
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:21,417
and visited the chamber where
the king's wife was sleeping.

291
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:22,626
My king.

292
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,846
Zeus?

293
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,563
Acrisius grew mad with rage.

294
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:46,317
He ordered the execution
of his wife...

295
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:48,903
and Zeus' newborn son.

296
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:56,660
I curse you, Zeus.

297
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,288
I deny you the body you soiled...

298
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,373
and the bastard child with it.

299
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,754
No.

300
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:23,312
The queen and her child
were cast into the sea.

301
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,522
Your mother was killed, but you...

302
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,442
part man, part god, you lived.

303
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:31,111
I've watched over
you ever since...

304
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,251
waiting for the day
when you will help

305
00:25:33,252 --> 00:25:35,324
bring an end to the
tyranny of the gods.

306
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:38,702
You were born to kill the Kraken.

307
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:43,415
I don't know why I was born...

308
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,752
or what I am.

309
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,714
But I know it's not the
Kraken I wanna kill.

310
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:53,425
How do I get to Hades?

311
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:55,636
If the Kraken falls...

312
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:59,473
Hades will be weak enough for
you to strike a deathly blow.

313
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,434
Only then will you have
the revenge you seek.

314
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:04,645
Then they better release me.

315
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,359
If the Kraken can be killed...

316
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,736
the Stygian witches will know how.

317
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:15,698
The witches are further away
than the legion has ever been.

318
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:16,991
No man can go there.

319
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:18,826
No man.

320
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,664
Keep your distance, Io.

321
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:29,461
Zeus, forgive us for these
affronts and protect us.

322
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:34,300
And you still believe
they're going to help?

323
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,427
This is suicide.

324
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:38,929
And the shields. Come on, boys.

325
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,140
It's a lost cause.

326
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,934
We've no chance, and you know it.

327
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:48,147
Here's who you drew into this,
Perseus. An honour guard.

328
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,693
Young men who look good
on a reviewing stand...

329
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:56,572
and old soldiers, heading
towards retirement.

330
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:59,408
Do you know what the Kraken is?

331
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:04,872
The Kraken is the end of us.
A colossal, elemental beast.

332
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,916
It doesn't think. It doesn't
feel. Even the gods fear it.

333
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:11,266
And you, you're going to kill it?

334
00:27:11,267 --> 00:27:12,504
Don't come.

335
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:16,258
- I don't need your help.
- Of course not.

336
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:19,303
You're the son of Zeus.

337
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,972
- But we have orders.
- Come, we need to leave.

338
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,686
Gentlemen, may our
journey be long,

339
00:27:24,687 --> 00:27:27,019
filled with agony and torment...

340
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:30,105
and may we all complain about
it bitterly as old men.

341
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:33,317
- So what should we bring?
- Bring everything.

342
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:40,115
What makes you think the
witches will tell us anything?

343
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:43,535
Oh, they'll tell us,
or I'll kill them too.

344
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,376
Come on. Let's go, boys.

345
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,921
- What is this?
- Just leave it.

346
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:02,262
Don't leave us to the mercy
of the gods. Please.

347
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,015
Don't go. Please stay.

348
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:10,020
Stay here. Please?
Please? Help us.

349
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,858
You're just going to make
the gods angrier. Please.

350
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:17,111
Just sacrifice the princess.

351
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:20,280
Watch your mouth.
Stay back. Stay back.

352
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,074
You'd think they
might be thankful.

353
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,326
You cannot desert us.

354
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,286
Maybe they're tired
of being thankful.

355
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:28,956
Good news.

356
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,208
My brother and I have decided...

357
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,334
to accompany you on your journey.

358
00:28:33,335 --> 00:28:35,129
We have enough strangers here.

359
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:38,132
We can be of great help to
you, trust me. You'll need us.

360
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:40,050
I need soldiers, not hunters.

361
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:43,459
Which one of your
soldiers knows how

362
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,180
to cut the impenetrable skin...

363
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:46,807
of the Nemean lion?

364
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:51,019
Which one of them knows the soft
points on a centaur's armour?

365
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:54,000
Which one of them
knows which jugular

366
00:28:54,001 --> 00:28:56,442
to slice on a five-headed Hydra?

367
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:59,987
- The middle one.
- The middle one. Good guess.

368
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,531
My brother and I, we
know how to kill.

369
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,324
- We enjoy it.
- If you can keep up...

370
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:06,410
and you don't mind
dying, come along.

371
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,663
It is death who should
be afraid of us.

372
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,421
King Acrisius.

373
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:02,216
There is no Acrisius.

374
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,593
Just Calibos.

375
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,645
We have an enemy in common.

376
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,898
- Zeus.
- Zeus.

377
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:23,237
My brother.

378
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,115
What do you want from me?

379
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:31,703
Zeus' seed in your wife survived.

380
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:34,498
The child of your shame.

381
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,292
Perseus.

382
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,961
He lives?

383
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:42,047
You murdered your
wife for nothing.

384
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:48,178
Now Perseus hurls himself
from Argos to destroy me.

385
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:50,472
He must die.

386
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,227
- What would you have me do?
- Zeus must think I serve him...

387
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:58,188
but I am growing stronger.

388
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:02,109
Until I possess my full power...

389
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:07,447
you will be my weapon.

390
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,118
Come.

391
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,691
Use this.

392
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:46,778
Kill Perseus for me.

393
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:51,033
And I'll destroy Zeus for you.

394
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,201
I serve you.

395
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:55,579
The boy will die.

396
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,461
How far is it?

397
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,630
Four days to the witches.

398
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:08,216
Four days? I'm tired already.

399
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,597
Here, use this.

400
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:20,395
Would you like us to wait?

401
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,148
Oops.

402
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:21,331
You really are a fisherman.

403
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,458
You should've seen my father.

404
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:25,419
You.

405
00:33:26,003 --> 00:33:27,713
Bring your weapon.

406
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,015
Have you handled a sword before?

407
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:41,309
- There's been no need.
- I see.

408
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,979
Left foot forward.

409
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:50,736
Your motions should be fluid.

410
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,613
The weapon is a part of you.

411
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,159
Like the sting on a wasp.

412
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,788
Stay focused.

413
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,415
Know what's around you.

414
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:08,628
Keep your balance at all times.

415
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:10,255
You fall...

416
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:13,175
you die.

417
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,139
Get up.

418
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,521
Don't...

419
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,750
There is a god in you.

420
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:48,627
Be sure to bring it.

421
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,340
End of lesson.

422
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,280
Perseus.

423
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:20,969
A gift from the gods.

424
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,972
- Forged on Olympus.
- Why?

425
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:26,266
Just accept it.

426
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:30,395
I can do this as a man.

427
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,399
So it's yours.

428
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:47,954
Gentlemen, retrieve our saviour.

429
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:49,641
The Pegasus.

430
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,853
No man has ever ridden one.

431
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:02,195
It's a message.

432
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:04,364
They're watching us.

433
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,216
Perseus.

434
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,844
Perseus.

435
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:28,930
Perseus.

436
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,560
Why does it always have to be...?

437
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,311
Listen.

438
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,447
Help me.

439
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,324
Help me.

440
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,331
You reek of your father.

441
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:05,193
- Who was that?
- I don't know. Let's ask him.

442
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:50,530
Let it go.

443
00:40:51,448 --> 00:40:52,490
No. We split up.

444
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,118
Just follow the blood.

445
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,089
Come on.

446
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:15,638
Look. His blood.

447
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,707
Are you happy now?

448
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:45,627
Attack.

449
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,846
Wait. Wait.

450
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:02,185
What is that?

451
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:40,700
Come on.

452
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:44,120
Ixas.

453
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:47,373
Spear.

454
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,770
Draco.

455
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:27,830
Faster.

456
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:35,046
Let's go, let's go.

457
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:37,131
Go, jump.

458
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:12,333
Run.

459
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,794
- Back up. Back up. Back up.
- There's more.

460
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:17,255
- Run.
- Everyone. Back to back.

461
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,353
Stand your ground.

462
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:40,945
Three more. In the name of
the gods, they're bigger.

463
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:02,842
What are they?

464
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,802
Djinn.

465
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:11,017
I fought them in the legion.

466
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:13,227
This is their desert.

467
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:16,397
- Enemies?
- I thought so.

468
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:20,485
They aren't human. Not any more.
Desert conjurers, cutthroats.

469
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:22,591
Well, somebody should thank them.

470
00:46:22,592 --> 00:46:23,592
What?

471
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:49,472
- What is it?
- Venom. From Hades.

472
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:55,645
- Pray. Pray to Zeus for strength.
- No. No.

473
00:46:55,812 --> 00:46:57,730
Pray to your damn father.

474
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:00,066
Hear my prayer. Protect
and heal your son.

475
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:02,652
- No.
- Please, Zeus, hear me.

476
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:14,330
Would you like some bread?

477
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,207
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

478
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:17,583
- Please.
- Have some bread.

479
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,293
Over here. Over here.

480
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:21,629
- For you.
- Please.

481
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:32,515
No.

482
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:36,602
We must turn our hearts to Hades.

483
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:39,063
It is the only way.

484
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:43,568
Brothers and sisters.

485
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:47,071
Come to me. Come.

486
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:53,160
I have the way out of our misery.

487
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:55,705
Hades has asked for the princess.

488
00:47:56,790 --> 00:48:00,835
Sacrifice one for the
life of the city.

489
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:05,881
Why do they remain
silent while we suffer?

490
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:09,594
Why do they guard the woman
whose death will save us?

491
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:12,096
Is she better than any one of you?

492
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:15,391
We have long worshipped
Zeus in Argos.

493
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:19,895
But it is Hades who now
offers us salvation.

494
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,567
We must pray to the one
who showed us our sin...

495
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:27,653
and who offers us redemption...

496
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,947
through blood.

497
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:47,423
A bribe for the ferryman.

498
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,683
When they get injured in battle...

499
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:01,812
they replace their limbs with
charwood and black magic.

500
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,399
They feel no pain.

501
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:07,360
Live hundreds of years.

502
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:09,487
So how old is that one?

503
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,035
I don't care. I don't trust them.

504
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,338
You're burning.

505
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:33,094
Drink this.

506
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:40,518
I'll get more water.

507
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:20,266
Come on.

508
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,272
Look out.

509
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:37,741
What?

510
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,286
What's he saying?

511
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:42,882
The Djinn have waited
many years for the

512
00:50:42,883 --> 00:50:44,707
one who will free
them from the gods.

513
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:47,659
He says he is no
friend of the humans.

514
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:48,660
You don't say.

515
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,506
But the only way we can
help Perseus is together.

516
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,640
Draco.

517
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:03,350
Look.

518
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:14,612
Together.

519
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:35,007
- He's not ready to travel.
- Time is slipping away, Io.

520
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:36,982
He may be a demigod,
but he's still mortal.

521
00:51:36,983 --> 00:51:37,983
Feeling better?

522
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:39,345
- Yeah, a bit.
- Good.

523
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,516
Your pride is killing my men.

524
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:46,352
- You were given gifts. Use them.
- Those gifts are a trap.

525
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,208
I don't care what
they are. Use them.

526
00:51:48,209 --> 00:51:49,209
No.

527
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:51,941
I will not use that sword or
anything that they give me.

528
00:51:52,108 --> 00:51:54,276
So we'll just continue to die.

529
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:04,411
I can't become like them.

530
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:10,876
If I do this, I do it as a man.

531
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:15,130
But you are not just a man.

532
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:17,841
I choose to be.

533
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:21,470
A man cannot do this, Perseus.

534
00:52:22,138 --> 00:52:23,514
According to who?

535
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:25,432
The gods?

536
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:39,905
If I had your gifts...

537
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:44,076
When you need your
sword, it's in my bag.

538
00:52:55,171 --> 00:52:56,213
They're riding them.

539
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:14,106
They tried to kill us.
I'm not getting on it.

540
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:18,152
Magnificent.

541
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,404
What are you waiting for?

542
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:23,616
Well, we need to make
up for lost time.

543
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,984
We're making good time.

544
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:02,071
Not good enough. The
eclipse is drawing near.

545
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:05,532
How close are we to
the Norn Mountains?

546
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:09,161
It'll be two days before
we reach the witches.

547
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,335
This thing is making me feel sick.

548
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:18,629
Trust me, it's better to
be on one than in one.

549
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:28,305
What, don't you ever smile?

550
00:54:28,473 --> 00:54:31,350
When I spit in the
eyes of the gods...

551
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,311
then I'll smile.

552
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:17,271
- What is this place?
- The Garden of Stygia.

553
00:55:18,314 --> 00:55:21,233
This is where the Kraken
defeated the Titans.

554
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:23,610
It's what Argos will
look like when we fail.

555
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:26,697
Every step we take is
an insult to the gods.

556
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:28,991
- Good.
- Perseus.

557
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:34,371
Only ask what you need
to know. Nothing more.

558
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:36,582
Of course.

559
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:18,665
Visitors.

560
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:20,292
- Who is it?
- Visitors.

561
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,377
Got the eye.

562
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:24,922
- Give it to me.
- Who is it?

563
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:30,177
Who is it? Who is it?

564
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:33,680
The eye. Give it to me.

565
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:35,140
Perseus, no.

566
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,476
We didn't come here to fight.

567
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:41,855
- We just have one question.
- Young Perseus.

568
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:44,316
- Son of Zeus.
- So fresh.

569
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:45,526
- Perseus.
- Closer.

570
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:46,777
A little nibble.

571
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:50,489
- Flesh of a god.
- Flesh of a god.

572
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:53,909
- Witch.
- Don't. Easy.

573
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:57,830
Stale meat, ladies.

574
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:05,112
So which one's gonna
answer my question?

575
00:57:05,113 --> 00:57:06,879
You want to know about the Kraken.

576
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:07,880
Kraken?

577
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:09,383
- Do it.
- Kill it.

578
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:11,677
- That's right.
- A wasted journey.

579
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,720
The Kraken fears no weapon.

580
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:15,722
It must have a weakness.

581
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,308
Maybe.

582
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:20,936
But knowledge demands payment.

583
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:23,355
- Sacrifice.
- Sacrifice.

584
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:24,648
- Eusebios.
- Watch out.

585
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:28,986
- Look out.
- Ixas, shoot.

586
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:34,741
- Help.
- The eye.

587
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:44,376
- Let him go. Do it.
- You wouldn't dare.

588
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:47,170
We cannot see the answers
without the eye.

589
00:57:47,338 --> 00:57:48,463
Let him go.

590
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:52,384
Now answer the question.

591
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:54,928
How do we kill the Kraken?

592
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:57,681
- There is a solution.
- Solution.

593
00:57:57,849 --> 00:57:59,516
But it is an impossible one.

594
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:01,727
- Yeah?
- The Gorgon, Medusa.

595
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:03,395
Medusa.

596
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:06,732
Anything of flesh is
killed by her gaze.

597
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:07,923
Killed by her.

598
00:58:07,924 --> 00:58:10,736
Her prison lies across
the River Styx...

599
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:13,989
- at the edge of the underworld.
- A Titan against a Titan.

600
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:16,909
She's no use against the
Kraken. We can't control her.

601
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:19,870
Then we take her head.

602
00:58:20,496 --> 00:58:23,999
- Clever boy.
- Now the eye. Give us the eye.

603
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,500
- The eye.
- The eye.

604
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:31,798
Where is it?

605
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:39,640
But wait. There's more. Don't
you want to know more?

606
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:41,058
Perseus, no.

607
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:44,227
- Tell him.
- Tell him.

608
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:45,437
What?

609
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:48,190
Your journey does not end well.

610
00:58:49,233 --> 00:58:51,109
Fate has spoken.

611
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:57,616
You will die, son of Zeus.

612
00:59:00,244 --> 00:59:01,662
It's a lie. Come.

613
00:59:02,538 --> 00:59:03,789
Written as history.

614
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:07,960
Perseus.

615
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:11,213
You will die.

616
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:32,234
Why are the Djinn leaving us?

617
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:35,362
They believe we will all
die. It's the prophecy.

618
00:59:57,468 --> 00:59:58,510
Who are you?

619
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:11,273
Well, you can call me Father...

620
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:14,985
- if you wish.
- My father's dead.

621
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,154
He was killed by a god.

622
01:00:17,321 --> 01:00:20,198
An unfortunate casualty in a
war men brought on themselves.

623
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:24,619
Men didn't murder my
family. Your brother did.

624
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:27,205
You heard the witches' prophesy.

625
01:00:27,373 --> 01:00:29,875
You will not defeat the
Kraken, much less Hades.

626
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:31,981
If you continue this journey, you

627
01:00:31,982 --> 01:00:34,212
will die, and Argos
will still fall.

628
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:36,048
If you're so sure,
why are you here?

629
01:00:36,215 --> 01:00:38,008
To offer you sanctuary.

630
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:41,970
Your blood is mine, Perseus,
and that makes you a god.

631
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:44,806
It's time you came to Olympus
and started living like one.

632
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:47,934
Rather die in the mud with those
men than live forever as a god.

633
01:00:48,102 --> 01:00:49,478
You foolish boy.

634
01:00:49,645 --> 01:00:52,647
Man's entire existence
is a gift of my grace.

635
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:54,232
For someone who created man...

636
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,777
you don't know much about us.

637
01:00:57,445 --> 01:00:59,404
We live...

638
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:02,324
we fight and we die...

639
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:05,202
for each other, not for you.

640
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:08,580
Tell Hades I'll see him soon.

641
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:12,094
I will not make this offer again.

642
01:01:12,095 --> 01:01:13,095
Good.

643
01:01:13,096 --> 01:01:14,920
Because I'd hate to
refuse you twice.

644
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:17,130
Perseus.

645
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:18,882
Wait.

646
01:01:25,598 --> 01:01:28,058
It's expensive where you're going.

647
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:54,668
Kucuk fashioned this
shield from the Scorpioch.

648
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:58,880
Stronger and lighter
than any metal.

649
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:01,383
Very rare and high-quality item.

650
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:07,722
We can fight anywhere...

651
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:12,144
but not in the underworld.

652
01:02:13,312 --> 01:02:14,855
Yeah.

653
01:02:19,443 --> 01:02:20,944
Good luck, fisherman.

654
01:02:35,668 --> 01:02:37,586
We all heard what
the witches said.

655
01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:41,256
But we can prove them wrong.

656
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:44,259
I need your help.

657
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:57,230
It wasn't the gods that
saved me up there.

658
01:02:59,775 --> 01:03:02,110
If you believe that
we have a chance.

659
01:03:06,073 --> 01:03:08,283
I never liked Argos much anyway.

660
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:15,248
I know the way.

661
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:23,381
Then we go to the
underworld. We kill Medusa.

662
01:04:13,474 --> 01:04:17,268
- Now what?
- We wait for Charon.

663
01:04:18,312 --> 01:04:20,021
Charon only ferries the dead.

664
01:04:21,065 --> 01:04:22,607
Any volunteers?

665
01:04:32,785 --> 01:04:33,994
Heads we swim.

666
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:01,813
A bribe for the ferryman.

667
01:05:57,661 --> 01:05:59,370
So, what happens
when we get there?

668
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:01,581
Just another beast to kill.

669
01:06:02,374 --> 01:06:04,000
A beast?

670
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:07,295
Medusa was beautiful once.

671
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:10,298
So beautiful as to tempt Poseidon.

672
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:12,675
When he came for her...

673
01:06:12,843 --> 01:06:14,949
she ran to Athena's
temple thinking

674
01:06:14,950 --> 01:06:17,055
that the goddess
would protect her.

675
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:19,265
She didn't.

676
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:22,769
Poseidon took her
on the cold floor.

677
01:06:23,562 --> 01:06:25,939
She prayed to Athena
for comfort...

678
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:28,483
but the goddess felt
nothing but disgust.

679
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:32,320
She made sure no one would
ever want Medusa again.

680
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:34,719
One look at the
creature she has become

681
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:36,783
will turn any living
thing to stone.

682
01:06:37,576 --> 01:06:41,287
I cannot assist you there.
A curse prevents me.

683
01:06:42,414 --> 01:06:44,486
It was Athena's one bit
of solace to Medusa

684
01:06:44,487 --> 01:06:46,417
so that Medusa would
never harm a woman.

685
01:06:47,586 --> 01:06:50,130
Only men are allowed
in the temple.

686
01:06:51,006 --> 01:06:53,758
Though no man has
ever made it out.

687
01:07:27,668 --> 01:07:30,795
Medusa's got a tail and
that's how she'll use it.

688
01:07:32,006 --> 01:07:33,506
Listen.

689
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:36,843
Hear her muscles coil.

690
01:07:37,511 --> 01:07:39,929
Smell her skin.

691
01:07:40,598 --> 01:07:43,308
Feel her hunger in your gut.

692
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:46,102
Medusa's killed you twice now.

693
01:07:47,354 --> 01:07:49,851
Do you think she'll
hand you her head?

694
01:07:49,852 --> 01:07:51,900
She won't be gracious about it.

695
01:07:52,359 --> 01:07:55,778
One look in her eyes and
you'll turn to stone.

696
01:07:57,656 --> 01:07:59,157
Good.

697
01:08:02,953 --> 01:08:06,331
- Try not to enjoy this so much.
- I'm trying to help you live.

698
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:09,667
Don't look at me.

699
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:32,106
Ease your storm.

700
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:42,784
We're nearing Medusa's lair.

701
01:08:59,176 --> 01:09:02,303
I never thought I could
reach this place.

702
01:09:04,223 --> 01:09:05,515
Who'd you lose?

703
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:13,982
My daughter.

704
01:09:16,068 --> 01:09:18,695
Taken away on her 16th birthday.

705
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:22,198
Dragged down here.

706
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:25,076
I have a feeling
I'll see her soon.

707
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:32,667
You brought us this far. Let's
go the rest of the way.

708
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:54,194
How many coins did
you get, Perseus?

709
01:09:54,195 --> 01:09:55,195
Just the one.

710
01:10:21,216 --> 01:10:23,217
I only knew one great
man in my life.

711
01:10:26,221 --> 01:10:27,764
My father.

712
01:10:30,768 --> 01:10:31,976
Now I know four more.

713
01:10:35,814 --> 01:10:36,856
And a woman.

714
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:41,319
And whatever the hell you are.

715
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:48,159
I know we're all afraid.

716
01:10:48,452 --> 01:10:49,869
But my father told me:

717
01:10:50,037 --> 01:10:53,081
Someday someone was gonna
have to take a stand.

718
01:10:53,582 --> 01:10:56,751
Someday someone was gonna
have to say enough.

719
01:10:59,671 --> 01:11:00,880
This could be that day.

720
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:04,717
Trust your senses.

721
01:11:04,885 --> 01:11:07,053
And don't look this
bitch in the eye.

722
01:11:38,168 --> 01:11:40,795
Doesn't really inspire confidence.

723
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:41,796
Quiet.

724
01:11:42,172 --> 01:11:44,424
- Listen.
- Eusebios.

725
01:11:44,591 --> 01:11:46,384
Keep your eyes down.

726
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:09,907
Here we go.

727
01:12:20,627 --> 01:12:22,670
Solon.

728
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,134
Keep going.

729
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:32,263
Flank her.

730
01:12:36,268 --> 01:12:38,936
- Draco.
- Go.

731
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:41,439
Eusebios, follow me.

732
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:48,154
Hang on.

733
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:23,356
Eusebios.

734
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:28,194
Remember what Perseus said.

735
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:36,285
Eyes down.

736
01:13:50,842 --> 01:13:52,385
Ixas, no.

737
01:13:59,017 --> 01:14:00,518
Eyes down.

738
01:14:05,357 --> 01:14:11,862
Where are you?

739
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:22,081
Eusebios.

740
01:14:28,338 --> 01:14:29,755
Go.

741
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:46,272
Wait here.

742
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:48,899
I'll lure her out.

743
01:14:50,193 --> 01:14:51,861
Get ready.

744
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:40,284
Now.

745
01:15:57,552 --> 01:16:00,346
Together.

746
01:16:42,389 --> 01:16:44,807
Let them know men did this.

747
01:18:10,435 --> 01:18:12,311
Just you and me, son of Zeus.

748
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:23,841
Perseus.

749
01:19:24,801 --> 01:19:26,552
Don't become one of them.

750
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:44,194
Io, I'm here.

751
01:19:46,573 --> 01:19:48,574
There's no time.

752
01:19:51,536 --> 01:19:53,203
The eclipse.

753
01:19:54,497 --> 01:19:57,875
Perseus, you must go
before it's too late.

754
01:20:02,756 --> 01:20:04,340
I'm not going anywhere.

755
01:20:05,550 --> 01:20:07,635
My fate is certain.

756
01:20:07,802 --> 01:20:11,138
But the fate of Argos
is still in your hands.

757
01:20:12,057 --> 01:20:14,391
All my life you've been there.

758
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:16,727
You never left me.

759
01:20:18,813 --> 01:20:19,980
I can't leave you.

760
01:20:21,775 --> 01:20:24,276
This part of the journey
you must do alone.

761
01:20:24,986 --> 01:20:26,403
Perseus...

762
01:20:26,571 --> 01:20:28,906
you're not just part
man, part god...

763
01:20:31,117 --> 01:20:33,285
you're the best of both.

764
01:20:38,792 --> 01:20:41,168
Everything will be all right.

765
01:21:36,975 --> 01:21:38,517
Brother.

766
01:21:39,144 --> 01:21:42,646
It is time for the mortals to pay.

767
01:21:45,316 --> 01:21:47,693
My child waits to do your will.

768
01:21:58,204 --> 01:21:59,955
Leave us.

769
01:22:07,005 --> 01:22:09,256
Release the Kraken.

770
01:22:36,868 --> 01:22:39,953
The Kraken comes now.

771
01:22:40,413 --> 01:22:44,750
Our suffering ends when
the beast is sated.

772
01:22:45,335 --> 01:22:47,336
Will it take us...

773
01:22:48,129 --> 01:22:51,256
or will it take Andromeda?

774
01:22:51,424 --> 01:22:53,509
Andromeda.

775
01:22:56,721 --> 01:22:58,472
It's my name they're calling.

776
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:01,892
This cannot continue.

777
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,446
- Stay back.
- Stay back.

778
01:23:44,477 --> 01:23:47,229
Look. The Kraken. Help us.

779
01:24:14,257 --> 01:24:16,341
Andromeda.

780
01:24:18,845 --> 01:24:23,849
Hades, we sacrifice our
princess in your name.

781
01:24:29,397 --> 01:24:32,649
It comes, brothers and sisters.

782
01:25:03,598 --> 01:25:05,224
Argos has fallen.

783
01:25:06,309 --> 01:25:08,977
Do you feel stronger, brother?

784
01:25:09,604 --> 01:25:12,356
You thought the Kraken would
bring you their prayers.

785
01:25:12,857 --> 01:25:17,110
But the Kraken is my
child. It feeds only me.

786
01:25:17,278 --> 01:25:20,656
I command Olympus.
Remember who you serve.

787
01:25:21,324 --> 01:25:23,575
I serve myself.

788
01:25:23,743 --> 01:25:26,870
I have since you cheated me.

789
01:25:28,122 --> 01:25:30,332
You sent me to the
underworld to be hated...

790
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:32,584
while you basked in their love.

791
01:25:33,711 --> 01:25:35,254
We need the love of humans.

792
01:25:35,421 --> 01:25:37,339
No, you need it.

793
01:25:37,507 --> 01:25:39,132
I survive on their fear.

794
01:25:39,717 --> 01:25:41,885
Your reign is over, brother Zeus.

795
01:25:42,053 --> 01:25:46,181
You'll watch while my blessed
avenger devours their hopes.

796
01:25:46,349 --> 01:25:49,393
And then finally
you'll know my pain.

797
01:25:49,936 --> 01:25:53,188
There is still a
demigod in Argos...

798
01:25:53,356 --> 01:25:55,065
brother.

799
01:25:59,737 --> 01:26:00,779
Perseus.

800
01:26:34,105 --> 01:26:36,398
The bag. Come on.

801
01:26:48,911 --> 01:26:50,579
Hyah.

802
01:28:07,031 --> 01:28:10,283
Hey, fisherman.

803
01:29:15,266 --> 01:29:16,975
Come on.

804
01:30:21,457 --> 01:30:23,333
No.

805
01:31:10,423 --> 01:31:12,215
I'm a god.

806
01:31:12,383 --> 01:31:14,092
I will live forever.

807
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:15,719
But not here.

808
01:32:41,472 --> 01:32:43,973
The boats are coming for us.

809
01:32:48,938 --> 01:32:50,355
For you. Not for me.

810
01:32:51,816 --> 01:32:53,441
You won't stay, will you?

811
01:32:55,111 --> 01:32:56,986
Perseus, Argos needs a ruler.

812
01:32:57,863 --> 01:32:59,197
I cannot be a king.

813
01:33:00,199 --> 01:33:02,033
I serve you better as a man.

814
01:33:03,285 --> 01:33:05,745
You'll make a fine queen for them.

815
01:33:45,744 --> 01:33:48,538
Olympus owes you a
debt of gratitude.

816
01:33:50,207 --> 01:33:51,833
As do I.

817
01:33:52,001 --> 01:33:53,626
Hades lives.

818
01:33:54,086 --> 01:33:56,379
He's just sent back
to the underworld.

819
01:33:56,547 --> 01:33:58,506
Biding his time, no doubt.

820
01:33:58,674 --> 01:34:00,581
Waiting for men to
grow weak, and in

821
01:34:00,582 --> 01:34:02,385
their weakness, he grows stronger.

822
01:34:03,220 --> 01:34:05,513
It's mankind who holds
the key to Hades' rise.

823
01:34:05,681 --> 01:34:06,723
It always was.

824
01:34:06,891 --> 01:34:09,267
So we'll see him again.

825
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:11,144
Yes.

826
01:34:11,312 --> 01:34:14,105
But now the world knows
a man can stop him.

827
01:34:14,899 --> 01:34:17,734
Of course, you had some help.

828
01:34:17,902 --> 01:34:21,070
A sword, the Pegasus...

829
01:34:22,031 --> 01:34:24,462
I wanted men to
worship us again, but

830
01:34:24,463 --> 01:34:26,701
I didn't want it to cost me a son.

831
01:34:28,954 --> 01:34:30,246
That's almost human of you.

832
01:34:30,414 --> 01:34:32,262
I don't suppose
you'll reconsider my

833
01:34:32,263 --> 01:34:34,209
offer to take your
place as one of us.

834
01:34:38,797 --> 01:34:41,216
I've got everything
I need right here.

835
01:34:42,009 --> 01:34:43,885
You may not want to
be a god, Perseus...

836
01:34:44,053 --> 01:34:47,597
but after feats like yours,
men will worship you.

837
01:34:48,974 --> 01:34:50,850
Be good to them.

838
01:34:51,018 --> 01:34:53,353
Be better than we were.

839
01:34:54,605 --> 01:34:57,941
And if you insist on continuing
this mundane human existence...

840
01:34:58,108 --> 01:34:59,901
I won't have you do it alone.

841
01:35:01,237 --> 01:35:02,820
You're the son of Zeus, after all.
