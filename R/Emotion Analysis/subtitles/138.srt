1
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:49,963
I'm gonna turn over the next card.
I want you to concentrate.

2
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:52,966
I want you to tell me
what you think it is.

3
00:02:58,471 --> 00:02:59,848
Square.

4
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:02,225
Good guess. But wrong.

5
00:03:11,776 --> 00:03:13,528
Clear your head.

6
00:03:15,613 --> 00:03:18,908
All right. Tell me what you think it is.

7
00:03:20,285 --> 00:03:21,870
Is it a star?

8
00:03:22,954 --> 00:03:26,708
It is a star. Very good. That's great.

9
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,627
Okay. All right.

10
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:33,798
Think hard. What is it?

11
00:03:34,591 --> 00:03:36,467
Circle.

12
00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:40,555
Close. But definitely wrong.

13
00:03:42,724 --> 00:03:44,350
Okay.

14
00:03:45,852 --> 00:03:48,271
- All right. Ready?
- Yeah.

15
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:49,814
All right.

16
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:53,151
What is it?

17
00:03:55,528 --> 00:03:56,863
Come on.

18
00:03:58,156 --> 00:03:59,991
Figure eight.

19
00:04:02,452 --> 00:04:06,247
Incredible. That's 5 for 5.
You can't see these, can you?

20
00:04:06,414 --> 00:04:10,376
- You're not cheating me, are you?
- No, I swear they're just coming to me.

21
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,670
Okay.

22
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:18,301
- Nervous?
- Yes. I don't like this.

23
00:04:18,468 --> 00:04:23,723
You only have 75 more to go, okay?
What's this one?

24
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:29,228
It's a couple of wavy lines.

25
00:04:29,395 --> 00:04:33,191
- Sorry. This isn't your lucky day.
- I know.

26
00:04:35,944 --> 00:04:37,779
Wait...

27
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:43,242
I'm getting a little tired of this!

28
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:45,912
You volunteered, didn't you?
We're paying, aren't we?

29
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:49,332
Yeah, but I didn't know you were
gonna give me electric shocks!

30
00:04:49,499 --> 00:04:51,542
What are you trying
to prove here, anyway?

31
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:55,672
I'm studying the effect of negative
reinforcement on ESP ability.

32
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:59,300
The effect? I'll tell you what
the effect is. It's pissing me off!

33
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:01,302
Well, then maybe my theory is correct!

34
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:05,264
- You can keep the 5 bucks. I've had it.
- I will, mister!

35
00:05:09,227 --> 00:05:11,938
You may as well get used to that.

36
00:05:12,188 --> 00:05:16,859
It's the kind of resentment that your
ability will provoke in some people.

37
00:05:17,193 --> 00:05:20,279
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?

38
00:05:21,614 --> 00:05:24,075
You're no fluke, Jennifer.

39
00:05:24,242 --> 00:05:26,703
This is it. This is definitely it!

40
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:29,247
Did those UV lenses come in
for the video camera?

41
00:05:29,414 --> 00:05:32,959
And that blank tape, I need it,
the one you erased yesterday.

42
00:05:33,126 --> 00:05:36,254
- Will you excuse me for a second?
- Sure.

43
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:40,925
I'm right in the middle
of something, Ray.

44
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:42,760
I need more time with this subject.

45
00:05:42,927 --> 00:05:45,430
Could you come back in an hour,
hour and a half?

46
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:47,598
Peter, at 1:40 p.m...

47
00:05:47,765 --> 00:05:51,185
...at the main branch of The New York
Public Library on Fifth Avenue...

48
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:56,065
...10 people witnessed a free-floating,
full-torso, vaporous apparition.

49
00:05:56,232 --> 00:05:58,401
It blew books off shelves
from 20 feet away...

50
00:05:58,568 --> 00:06:00,945
...and scared the socks
off some poor librarian.

51
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:03,322
I'm very excited. I'm very pleased.

52
00:06:03,489 --> 00:06:07,410
I want you to get right down there,
check it out, and get back to me.

53
00:06:07,577 --> 00:06:10,413
You're coming with us on this one.
Spengler went down there.

54
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,624
He took PKE valences,
went right off the top of the scale.

55
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:18,129
Buried the needle.
We're close on this one. I can feel it.

56
00:06:20,882 --> 00:06:24,719
I can feel it. We're very, very close.

57
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:29,932
I have to go now, Jennifer, but I'd
like to work with you some more.

58
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:32,268
Perhaps you could come back
this evening at...?

59
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:33,811
Eight o'clock?

60
00:06:33,978 --> 00:06:38,858
I was just going to say, "8:00?"
You are a legitimate phenomenon.

61
00:06:41,903 --> 00:06:43,237
As a friend, I must say...

62
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:46,365
...you've finally gone around the bend
on this ghost business.

63
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:49,535
You guys have been meeting
every schizo in the five boroughs...

64
00:06:49,702 --> 00:06:52,705
...who says he has a paranormal
experience. What have you seen?

65
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:58,211
You forget, I was there at an undersea,
unexplained mass sponge migration.

66
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:03,257
Oh, Ray, the sponges migrated
about a foot and a half.

67
00:07:09,222 --> 00:07:11,182
- You're here.
- Yeah, what have you got?

68
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:14,560
This is big, this is very big.
There's definitely something here.

69
00:07:14,727 --> 00:07:18,481
Egon, this reminds me of the time you
tried to drill a hole through your head.

70
00:07:18,648 --> 00:07:20,691
- Remember that?
- That would've worked if...

71
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:23,778
I'm Roger Delacorte.
Are you the men from the university?

72
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:27,532
Yes. I'm Dr. Venkman.
Dr. Stantz. Egon.

73
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:31,702
Thank you for coming. I hope we
can clear this up quickly and quietly.

74
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:36,207
Let's not rush things. We don't
even know what you have yet.

75
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,709
I don't remember seeing any legs...

76
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:42,046
...but it definitely had arms,
because it reached out for me.

77
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:44,340
Arms? I can't wait
to get a look at this.

78
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:47,301
Alice, I'll ask you a couple
of standard questions, okay?

79
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:49,804
Have you or any member
of your family...

80
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:54,058
...ever been diagnosed schizophrenic,
mentally incompetent?

81
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:57,979
My uncle thought he was St. Jerome.

82
00:07:59,147 --> 00:08:01,941
I'd call that a big yes.

83
00:08:02,984 --> 00:08:06,404
Are you habitually using drugs,
stimulants, alcohol?

84
00:08:06,571 --> 00:08:09,866
- No.
- No, no. Just asking.

85
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:13,536
Are you, Alice,
menstruating right now?

86
00:08:13,703 --> 00:08:18,875
- What has that got to do with it?
- Back off, man. I'm a scientist.

87
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:22,170
Ray, it's moving. Come on.

88
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:48,654
Look!

89
00:08:54,285 --> 00:08:58,122
- This is hot, Ray.
- Symmetrical book-stacking.

90
00:08:58,289 --> 00:09:02,210
Just like the Philadelphia
mass turbulence of 1947.

91
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:06,631
You're right. No human being
would stack books like this.

92
00:09:07,131 --> 00:09:10,718
Listen! Do you smell something?

93
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:22,313
Talk about telekinetic activity.
Look at this mess.

94
00:09:23,231 --> 00:09:25,524
Raymond, look at this.

95
00:09:26,025 --> 00:09:28,236
Ectoplasmic residue.

96
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:32,490
- Venkman, get a sample of this.
- It's the real thing.

97
00:09:32,657 --> 00:09:34,992
Somebody blows their nose,
and you wanna keep it?

98
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,827
I'd like to analyze it.

99
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:40,957
- There's more over here.
- I'm getting stronger readings here.

100
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:48,798
This way.

101
00:09:50,675 --> 00:09:52,301
Come on.

102
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:04,522
Egon, your mucus.

103
00:10:11,821 --> 00:10:13,864
This happen to you before?

104
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:17,368
First time?

105
00:10:42,727 --> 00:10:44,478
It's here.

106
00:10:45,396 --> 00:10:49,608
A full torso apparition. And it's real.

107
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:56,282
So, what do we do?

108
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:04,206
Could you come over here
and talk to me for a second, please?

109
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:06,542
Could you just come here
for a second, please?

110
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:10,171
Right over here.
Come here, Francine. Come here.

111
00:11:10,755 --> 00:11:13,841
- What do we do?
- I don't know. What do you think?

112
00:11:14,008 --> 00:11:15,801
Stop that!

113
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:19,263
We've gotta make contact.
One of us should try to speak to it.

114
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,890
Good idea.

115
00:11:29,607 --> 00:11:31,108
Hello.

116
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,319
I'm Peter.

117
00:11:34,153 --> 00:11:37,448
Where are you from? Originally.

118
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:45,331
All right. Okay.
The usual stuff isn't working.

119
00:11:45,498 --> 00:11:49,835
Okay, I have a plan.
I know exactly what to do.

120
00:11:51,796 --> 00:11:53,923
Now, stay close.

121
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:56,300
Stay close.

122
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,470
I know. Do exactly as I say.

123
00:11:59,637 --> 00:12:01,889
Get ready. Ready?

124
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:03,557
Get her!

125
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:15,152
- Did you see it? What was it?
- We'll get back to you.

126
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:16,654
Wait!

127
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:30,042
"Get her." That was your whole plan.
Get her.

128
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:35,005
- It was scientific.
- I just got overexcited.

129
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:39,176
But wasn't it incredible, Pete?
We actually touched the etheric plane.

130
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:41,429
You know what this could mean
to the school?

131
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:43,931
Yeah, it's gonna be bigger
than the microchip.

132
00:12:44,098 --> 00:12:45,808
The experience wasn't wasted.

133
00:12:45,975 --> 00:12:48,811
According to these readings,
we have an excellent chance...

134
00:12:48,978 --> 00:12:50,646
...of catching and holding a ghost.

135
00:12:50,813 --> 00:12:54,817
This is great. If the ionization rate is
constant for all ectoplasmic entities...

136
00:12:54,984 --> 00:12:58,195
...we could really bust some heads.
In a spiritual sense, of course.

137
00:12:58,362 --> 00:13:01,365
Spengs, you serious
about this catching a ghost?

138
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:03,451
I'm always serious.

139
00:13:03,993 --> 00:13:07,663
Egon, I'm gonna take back some
of the things I've said about you.

140
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:12,293
You've earned it.

141
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:18,507
The possibilities are limitless.
Hey, Dean Yeager.

142
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:24,638
I trust you're moving us
to better quarters on campus.

143
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:26,891
No, you're being moved off campus.

144
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:29,727
The Board of Regents has decided
to terminate your grant.

145
00:13:29,894 --> 00:13:32,730
You are to vacate
these premises immediately.

146
00:13:32,897 --> 00:13:35,900
This is preposterous.
I demand an explanation.

147
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:39,069
Fine. This university
will no longer continue...

148
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:42,573
...any funding of any kind
for your group's activities.

149
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,408
But the kids love us.

150
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:50,706
Dr. Venkman, we believe the purpose
of science is to serve mankind.

151
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:55,419
You, however, seem to regard science
as some kind of dodge or hustle.

152
00:13:55,628 --> 00:13:58,005
Your theories are the worst kind
of popular tripe.

153
00:13:58,172 --> 00:14:01,509
Your methods are sloppy, and your
conclusions are highly questionable.

154
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:05,137
You are a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman.

155
00:14:06,222 --> 00:14:07,765
I see.

156
00:14:07,932 --> 00:14:12,770
And you have no place in this
department or in this university.

157
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:16,190
This is a major disgrace.
Forget MIT or Stanford now.

158
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:18,776
They wouldn't touch us
with a 10-meter cattle prod.

159
00:14:18,943 --> 00:14:21,278
You're always so concerned
about your reputation.

160
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:24,281
Einstein did his best stuff
when he was a patent clerk.

161
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:26,283
You know how much
a patent clerk earns?

162
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:30,120
The university gave us money.
We didn't have to produce anything.

163
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:33,374
You've never been out of college.
You don't know what it's like.

164
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:36,961
I've worked in the private sector.
They expect results.

165
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:38,963
For whatever reasons, Ray...

166
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:44,218
...call it fate, call it luck,
call it karma...

167
00:14:44,385 --> 00:14:47,221
...I believe that everything
happens for a reason.

168
00:14:47,388 --> 00:14:51,475
I believe that we were destined
to get thrown out of this dump.

169
00:14:51,684 --> 00:14:56,647
- For what purpose?
- To go into business for ourselves.

170
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:03,445
This ecto-containment system
Spengler and I have in mind...

171
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:07,157
...will require a load of capital.
Where will we get the money?

172
00:15:08,826 --> 00:15:12,496
I don't know. I don't know.

173
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:16,750
You're never gonna regret this, Ray.

174
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:19,503
My parents left me that house.
I was born there.

175
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:22,923
You won't lose the house. Everybody
has three mortgages nowadays.

176
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,759
But at 19 percent?
You didn't even bargain with the guy.

177
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:28,429
Ray, for your information,
the interest rate alone...

178
00:15:28,596 --> 00:15:31,348
...for the first five years
comes to 95,000 dollars.

179
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:34,518
Will you guys relax? We are
on the threshold of establishing...

180
00:15:34,727 --> 00:15:37,771
...the indispensable defense science
of the next decade:

181
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:41,525
Professional paranormal
investigations and eliminations.

182
00:15:41,734 --> 00:15:46,363
The franchise rights alone will make
us rich beyond our wildest dreams.

183
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:49,700
There's office space,
sleeping quarters and showers...

184
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:51,452
...and there's a full kitchen.

185
00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:56,540
It just seems a little pricey for a unique
fixer-upper opportunity, that's all.

186
00:15:56,749 --> 00:15:58,542
What do you think, Egon?

187
00:15:58,751 --> 00:16:00,961
I think this building
should be condemned.

188
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:03,672
There's metal fatigue
in all the load-bearing members.

189
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,468
The wiring is substandard.
It's inadequate for our power needs.

190
00:16:07,635 --> 00:16:10,554
And the neighborhood
is like a demilitarized zone.

191
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:13,641
Hey, does this pole still work?

192
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:20,731
Wow, this place is great.
When can we move in?

193
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:24,902
You gotta try this pole.
I'm gonna get my stuff.

194
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:33,285
Hey, we should stay here tonight,
sleep here. You know, to try it out.

195
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:45,255
- I think we'll take it.
- Good.

196
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,375
Hi.

197
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:29,383
- Dana, it's you.
- Hi. Yes, Louis, it's me.

198
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,927
- I thought it was the drugstore.
- Are you sick?

199
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:33,804
No, I'm fine. I feel great.

200
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:37,141
Just ordered some more vitamins
and stuff. I was just exercising.

201
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:39,977
I taped <i>@0-Minute Workout</i>
and played it at high speed...

202
00:17:40,144 --> 00:17:42,312
...so it took 10 minutes.
Got a great workout.

203
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:44,231
Want to come in for a mineral water?

204
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:47,651
I'd really like to, Louis,
but I have a rehearsal. Excuse me.

205
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,987
No sweat.
I'll take a rain check on that.

206
00:17:50,154 --> 00:17:53,615
I have plenty of low-sodium mineral
water and other nutritious foods.

207
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:55,659
- But you already know that.
- I know that.

208
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:58,912
That reminds me, I'm having
a big party for all my clients.

209
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,914
My fourth anniversary
as an accountant.

210
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:03,000
Even though you do
your own tax return...

211
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:04,960
...stop by, since you're
my neighbor.

212
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:07,254
Thank you, Louis.
I'll really try to stop by.

213
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:10,591
You shouldn't leave your TV
on so loud when you go out.

214
00:18:10,758 --> 00:18:12,760
The creep down the hall
phoned the manager.

215
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,095
That's strange.
I didn't realize I left it on.

216
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:18,098
I climbed on the ledge
and tried to disconnect the cable...

217
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:21,685
...but I couldn't get in,
so I turned up my TV real loud too...

218
00:18:21,894 --> 00:18:25,189
...so everyone would think both our
TVs had something wrong with them.

219
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:28,942
Okay, so I'll see you later, huh?
I'll give you a call.

220
00:18:29,902 --> 00:18:32,196
I gotta have a shower.

221
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,369
<i>Are you troubled by strange noises
in the middle of the night?</i>

222
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:42,706
<i>Do you experience feelings of dread
in your basement or attic?</i>

223
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:46,126
<i>Have you or any of your family ever
seen a spook, specter or ghost?</i>

224
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:49,880
<i>If the answer is yes, pick up your
phone and call the professionals.</i>

225
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:51,548
<i>Ghostbusters.</i>

226
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:54,051
<i>Our courteous staff is on
call @4 hours a day...</i>

227
00:18:54,218 --> 00:18:56,512
<i>...to serve
your supernatural-elimination needs.</i>

228
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:59,848
<i>We're ready to believe you.</i>

229
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:13,130
Zuul.

230
00:20:17,593 --> 00:20:19,136
You don't think it's too subtle?

231
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:22,931
You don't think people are gonna
drive down and not see the sign?

232
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:33,400
You can't park that here!

233
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:39,656
Everybody can relax, I found the car.

234
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:42,284
Needs some suspension work
and shocks...

235
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:46,496
...and brakes, brake pads, linings,
steering box, transmission, rear end.

236
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:48,165
- How much?
- Only 4800.

237
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:51,001
Maybe new rings, also mufflers,
a little wiring.

238
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:57,674
- Janine, any calls?
- No.

239
00:20:57,841 --> 00:21:00,344
- Any messages?
- No.

240
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:04,681
- Any customers?
- No, Dr. Venkman.

241
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:08,101
It's a good job, isn't it?

242
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:11,688
Type something, will you?
We're paying for this stuff.

243
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:15,192
Don't stare at me.
You've got the bug eyes.

244
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:17,527
Janine?

245
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:20,822
Sorry about the "bug eyes" thing.
I'll be in my office.

246
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:26,828
You're very handy. I can tell.

247
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:32,709
- I bet you like to read a lot too.
- Print is dead.

248
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:36,713
Oh, that's very fascinating to me.
I read a lot myself.

249
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,551
Some people think I'm too intellectual,
but it's a fabulous way to spend time.

250
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:45,847
I also play racquetball.
Do you have any hobbies?

251
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:49,935
I collect spores, molds and fungus.

252
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:56,233
Hello?

253
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:17,462
Excuse me. Is this...?
This is the Ghostbusters' office.

254
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:20,590
Yes, it is. Can I help you?

255
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:24,678
I don't have an appointment.
I'd like to talk to someone, please.

256
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:29,975
I'm Peter Venkman. May I help you?

257
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:35,480
Well, I don't know. What I have
to say may sound a little unusual.

258
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:38,483
That's all we get, day in, day out,
around this place.

259
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:42,154
- Come into my office, Miss...
- Barrett. Dana Barrett.

260
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,616
And this voice said, "Zuul," and then I
slammed the refrigerator door and left.

261
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:49,828
That was two days ago, and I haven't
been back to my apartment.

262
00:22:49,995 --> 00:22:53,165
Generally, you don't see that
behavior in a major appliance.

263
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:54,666
What do you think it was?

264
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:57,294
Well, if I knew what it was,
I wouldn't be here.

265
00:22:57,461 --> 00:22:59,004
Egon, what do you think?

266
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:02,299
She's telling the truth.
At least she thinks she is.

267
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:06,970
Well, of course I'm telling the truth.
Who would make up a story like that?

268
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:09,014
Some are people
who just want attention.

269
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:11,308
Others are nutballs
who come off the street.

270
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:15,854
You know what it could be? Past life
experience intruding on present time.

271
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:18,648
Could be a memory stored
in the collective unconscious.

272
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:21,860
I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance
or telepathic contact either.

273
00:23:22,027 --> 00:23:24,613
I'm sorry, I don't believe
in any of those things.

274
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:28,992
Well, that's all right. I don't either.
But there are some things we do...

275
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:32,704
...standard procedures in a case
like this, which often bring us results.

276
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:35,957
I could check out the structural details
in the building.

277
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:38,710
Maybe the building has a history
of psychic turbulence.

278
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:40,212
Right. Good idea.

279
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:42,547
I could search "Zuul"
in the usual literature.

280
00:23:42,756 --> 00:23:45,217
<i>- Spates Catalog.
- Tobin's Spirit Guide.</i>

281
00:23:45,383 --> 00:23:49,346
I'll take Miss Barrett back
to her apartment and check her out.

282
00:23:49,513 --> 00:23:53,517
I'll go check out
Miss Barrett's apartment. Okay?

283
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:55,894
Okay.

284
00:23:56,686 --> 00:23:59,523
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

285
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,698
Please, let me.

286
00:24:08,865 --> 00:24:13,078
If something's gonna happen here,
I want it to happen to me first.

287
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:19,417
That's the closet.

288
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:28,218
They hate this.

289
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,720
I like to torture them.

290
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:34,724
That's right, boys. It's Dr. Venkman!

291
00:24:40,355 --> 00:24:42,399
It's a lot of space.

292
00:24:43,692 --> 00:24:46,444
- Just you?
- Yes.

293
00:24:47,028 --> 00:24:48,405
Good.

294
00:24:52,576 --> 00:24:54,953
What is that thing you're doing?

295
00:24:55,704 --> 00:24:58,915
It's technical.
It's one of our little toys.

296
00:24:59,082 --> 00:25:00,625
I see.

297
00:25:02,836 --> 00:25:06,756
That's the bedroom.
But nothing ever happened in there.

298
00:25:09,718 --> 00:25:11,845
What a crime.

299
00:25:13,763 --> 00:25:16,766
You know, you don't act
like a scientist.

300
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:21,771
- They're usually pretty stiff.
- You're more like a game-show host.

301
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:30,363
That's the kitchen, huh?

302
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:44,753
- Dana, are these the eggs?
- Yes.

303
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,089
I was over there, and these eggs
jumped out of their shells...

304
00:25:48,256 --> 00:25:50,842
- ...and started to cook on the counter.
- That is weird.

305
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:55,138
That's when I started to hear that awful
noise coming from the refrigerator.

306
00:25:56,181 --> 00:26:00,644
You've come all this way. Would you
like to check the refrigerator?

307
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:05,482
Better check the fridge. Good call.

308
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:12,906
Oh, my God.

309
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:15,951
Look at all the junk food.

310
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:18,995
- No. Goddamn it! This wasn't...
- You actually eat this stuff?

311
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:21,039
This wasn't here.
There was nothing here.

312
00:26:21,206 --> 00:26:24,834
There was a space and a building
with flames coming out of it.

313
00:26:25,001 --> 00:26:28,713
There were creatures writhing around,
and they were growling and snarling.

314
00:26:28,922 --> 00:26:31,675
And there were flames,
and I heard a voice say, "Zuul."

315
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:33,176
It was right here.

316
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:35,178
I'm sorry, I'm not getting any reading.

317
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:38,390
Well, are you sure
you're using that thing correctly?

318
00:26:38,556 --> 00:26:42,560
I think so. But I'm sure
there are no animals in there.

319
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:44,062
Well, that's great.

320
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:47,816
Either I have a monster in my kitchen,
or I'm completely crazy.

321
00:26:47,983 --> 00:26:50,318
I don't think you're crazy.

322
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:56,032
Oh, good. That makes me
feel so much better.

323
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:57,867
Let me tell you something about me.

324
00:26:58,034 --> 00:27:01,162
I come home from work to my place,
and all I have is my work.

325
00:27:01,329 --> 00:27:02,872
There's nothing else in my life.

326
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:07,335
I meet you and say, "There's someone
with the same problem I have."

327
00:27:07,502 --> 00:27:10,338
Yes, we both have
the same problem. You.

328
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:16,219
I'm gonna go for broke.

329
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:21,766
- I am madly in love with you.
- I don't believe this.

330
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:24,519
Will you please leave?

331
00:27:24,769 --> 00:27:28,064
And then she threw me out of her life.
She thought I was a creep.

332
00:27:28,231 --> 00:27:31,234
She thought I was a geek,
and she probably wasn't the first.

333
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:33,695
You are so odd.

334
00:27:37,615 --> 00:27:40,076
- No.
- I've got it!

335
00:27:40,243 --> 00:27:43,038
- No.
- I'll prove myself to you.

336
00:27:43,204 --> 00:27:44,956
That's not necessary.

337
00:27:45,123 --> 00:27:47,917
- Yeah, I'll solve your little problem.
- Okay.

338
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:51,755
And then you'll say, "Pete Venkman's
a guy who can get things done."

339
00:27:51,921 --> 00:27:53,923
- "I wonder what makes him tick."
- I wonder.

340
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:57,093
"I wonder if he'd be interested
in knowing what makes me tick."

341
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:00,055
I'll bet you're gonna be thinking
about me after I'm gone.

342
00:28:00,221 --> 00:28:01,639
I bet I am.

343
00:28:03,141 --> 00:28:04,809
No kiss?

344
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:16,780
To our first customer.

345
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:20,075
To our first and only customer.

346
00:28:21,326 --> 00:28:22,994
I'll need to draw some petty cash.

347
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:25,997
I should take her out to dinner.
We don't want to lose her.

348
00:28:26,206 --> 00:28:31,294
This magnificent feast here
represents the last of the petty cash.

349
00:28:33,004 --> 00:28:35,632
Hey, slow down. Chew your food.

350
00:28:36,883 --> 00:28:39,219
Hello, Ghostbusters.

351
00:28:39,803 --> 00:28:42,680
Yes, of course they're serious.

352
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:46,184
You do?

353
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:48,728
You have?

354
00:28:48,895 --> 00:28:50,647
No kidding.

355
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:54,692
Well, just give me the address.

356
00:28:55,318 --> 00:28:59,614
Yes, of course.
Oh, they'll be totally discreet.

357
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,409
Thank you.

358
00:29:02,826 --> 00:29:04,828
We got one!

359
00:29:09,707 --> 00:29:11,418
It's a call!

360
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:20,552
Come on!

361
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:57,464
Hey, anybody see a ghost?

362
00:30:02,385 --> 00:30:04,762
- Thank you for coming so quickly.
- Jesus!

363
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:07,974
The guests are asking questions,
and I'm running out of excuses.

364
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:09,476
Has it happened before?

365
00:30:09,684 --> 00:30:12,228
Most of the original staff
knows about the 12th floor.

366
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:13,897
- The disturbances, I mean.
- Yeah.

367
00:30:14,063 --> 00:30:16,983
But it's been quiet for years
up until two weeks ago.

368
00:30:17,192 --> 00:30:18,943
It was never, ever this bad, though.

369
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:23,156
- Did you ever report it to anyone?
- No. Heavens, no.

370
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:25,950
The owners don't like us
to even talk about it.

371
00:30:26,117 --> 00:30:28,119
I hope we could take care
of this quietly.

372
00:30:28,286 --> 00:30:29,621
- It's done.
- Tonight.

373
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:31,331
Yes, sir. Don't worry.

374
00:30:31,498 --> 00:30:34,083
We handle this kind of thing
all the time.

375
00:30:42,258 --> 00:30:45,595
What are you supposed to be,
some kind of a cosmonaut?

376
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:49,641
No, we're exterminators. Somebody
saw a cockroach up on 12th.

377
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:54,229
- That's gotta be some cockroach.
- Bite your head off, man.

378
00:30:57,941 --> 00:31:01,528
- Going up?
- I'll take the next one.

379
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:07,992
It just occurred to me we haven't had
a successful test of this equipment.

380
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,370
- I blame myself.
- So do I.

381
00:31:10,537 --> 00:31:13,540
- Well, no sense worrying about it now.
- Why worry?

382
00:31:13,748 --> 00:31:18,294
Each of us is wearing an unlicensed
nuclear accelerator on his back.

383
00:31:18,461 --> 00:31:22,882
Yep. Well, let's get ready.
Switch me on.

384
00:31:58,918 --> 00:32:01,588
What the hell are you doing?

385
00:32:03,047 --> 00:32:05,258
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.

386
00:32:05,425 --> 00:32:07,510
We thought you were someone else.

387
00:32:09,846 --> 00:32:11,806
Successful test.

388
00:32:12,223 --> 00:32:13,933
I guess so.

389
00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:16,561
- I think we'd better split up.
- Good idea.

390
00:32:16,728 --> 00:32:18,688
Yeah, we can do
more damage that way.

391
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:49,469
Venkman? Venkman!

392
00:32:57,226 --> 00:32:59,562
Disgusting blob.

393
00:33:00,355 --> 00:33:02,649
I'm gonna have to hold him myself.

394
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,983
Come in, Ray.

395
00:33:47,652 --> 00:33:50,530
Venkman! I saw it! I saw it!

396
00:33:50,905 --> 00:33:52,699
It's right here, Ray.

397
00:33:52,907 --> 00:33:54,450
It's looking at me.

398
00:33:54,617 --> 00:33:56,536
<i>He's an ugly little spud, isn't he?</i>

399
00:33:56,703 --> 00:33:58,204
I think he can hear you, Ray.

400
00:33:58,413 --> 00:34:00,289
Don't move. It won't hurt you.

401
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:09,841
Venkman!

402
00:34:11,676 --> 00:34:14,303
Venkman! Pete!

403
00:34:16,931 --> 00:34:18,975
Venkman, what happened?
Are you okay?

404
00:34:19,142 --> 00:34:20,560
He slimed me.

405
00:34:20,727 --> 00:34:24,147
That's great! Actual physical contact!

406
00:34:24,313 --> 00:34:26,482
- Can you move?
<i>- Ray. Ray! Come in, please!</i>

407
00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:27,984
I feel so funky.

408
00:34:28,151 --> 00:34:30,653
Spengler! I'm with Venkman.

409
00:34:30,862 --> 00:34:32,321
He got slimed!

410
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:34,407
<i>That's great, Ray. Save some for me.</i>

411
00:34:34,574 --> 00:34:37,243
<i>Get down here, right away!
It just went into a ballroom.</i>

412
00:34:37,452 --> 00:34:38,745
Okay, we'll be right there.

413
00:34:41,956 --> 00:34:44,333
If you and your staff
could please wait out here...

414
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,836
...we'll take care of everything.

415
00:35:05,271 --> 00:35:07,774
There it is. On the ceiling.

416
00:35:10,109 --> 00:35:12,528
That's the one that got me.

417
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:21,454
All right, boys.

418
00:35:21,621 --> 00:35:23,372
Ready?

419
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:24,874
Throw it!

420
00:35:34,509 --> 00:35:35,885
I did that. I did that.

421
00:35:36,052 --> 00:35:38,721
- That's my fault.
- It's okay. The table broke the fall.

422
00:35:39,222 --> 00:35:41,724
There's something very important
I forgot to tell you.

423
00:35:41,891 --> 00:35:44,227
- What?
- Don't cross the streams.

424
00:35:45,102 --> 00:35:47,021
- Why?
- It would be bad.

425
00:35:47,313 --> 00:35:50,775
I'm fuzzy on the whole good/bad thing.
What do you mean, "bad"?

426
00:35:50,942 --> 00:35:54,737
Imagine all life as you know it stopping
instantaneously and every molecule...

427
00:35:54,904 --> 00:35:57,156
...in your body exploding
at the speed of light.

428
00:35:57,907 --> 00:35:59,575
Total protonic reversal.

429
00:35:59,742 --> 00:36:03,663
Right, that's bad. Okay,
important safety tip. Thanks, Egon.

430
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:08,251
All right, Ray, take the left.
Egon, take the right.

431
00:36:14,799 --> 00:36:17,426
Okay, Ray, just give me
one high and outside.

432
00:36:17,593 --> 00:36:19,345
Ray!

433
00:36:22,056 --> 00:36:23,474
Egon!

434
00:36:31,274 --> 00:36:33,276
Okay, all right.
Hold it, hold it, hold it!

435
00:36:36,779 --> 00:36:38,322
Nice shooting, Tex!

436
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:40,783
I assure you, there is no problem
with the room.

437
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:43,286
It'll be ready as soon as your guests
are here.

438
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:45,538
It took something out of him,
but he'll move.

439
00:36:45,705 --> 00:36:48,624
I need some room to put the trap
down. Give me some room.

440
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:51,711
You'll excuse me, please.

441
00:36:58,175 --> 00:37:01,178
- Gotta get this in the clear.
- Wait, wait, wait!

442
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:03,973
I've always wanted to do this.

443
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,683
And...

444
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:08,728
- The flowers are still standing!
- Okay, on my go-signal.

445
00:37:08,895 --> 00:37:12,148
Spengler, I want a confinement stream
from you, okay? Go!

446
00:37:12,315 --> 00:37:15,067
Okay, hold him up there.
He's gonna move. Hold him up!

447
00:37:15,234 --> 00:37:16,652
Go!

448
00:37:18,487 --> 00:37:20,323
- It's working.
- Start bringing him down.

449
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:22,241
You got him. Don't cross the stream.

450
00:37:22,408 --> 00:37:26,579
Maybe now you'll never slime a guy
with a positron collider, huh?

451
00:37:26,746 --> 00:37:30,124
Venkman, shorten your stream.
I don't want my face burned off.

452
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:33,336
I'm opening the trap now.
Don't look directly into the trap.

453
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,088
I looked at the trap, Ray.

454
00:37:36,255 --> 00:37:40,676
Turn your streams off when I close
the trap. Get ready. I'm closing it.

455
00:37:40,843 --> 00:37:42,762
Now!

456
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,657
It's in there.

457
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:08,162
Well, that wasn't such a chore,
now, was it?

458
00:38:10,915 --> 00:38:13,209
Mr. Smith, quickly.
I want that door open now!

459
00:38:13,376 --> 00:38:15,169
Donald, stand over there.

460
00:38:15,795 --> 00:38:18,547
We came, we saw, we kicked its ass!

461
00:38:18,714 --> 00:38:20,132
Did you see it? What is it?

462
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:21,634
We got it.

463
00:38:21,801 --> 00:38:23,803
What is it?
Will there be any more of them?

464
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:26,889
What you had there
was what we refer to as a focused...

465
00:38:27,056 --> 00:38:30,810
...non-terminal repeating phantasm,
or a class-five full-roaming vapor.

466
00:38:30,977 --> 00:38:32,687
Real nasty one too.

467
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:34,689
And now...

468
00:38:34,855 --> 00:38:36,190
...let's talk seriously.

469
00:38:36,357 --> 00:38:40,736
For the entrapment, we're gonna have
to ask you for four big ones, $4000.

470
00:38:40,903 --> 00:38:44,073
But we are having a special this week
on proton charging...

471
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,574
...and storage of the beast.

472
00:38:45,741 --> 00:38:48,244
That's only gonna come to
1000 dollars, fortunately.

473
00:38:48,411 --> 00:38:51,998
Five thousand dollars? I had no idea
it'd be so much. I won't pay it.

474
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:54,333
That's all right.
We can just put it back.

475
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,377
We certainly can, Dr. Venkman.

476
00:38:56,544 --> 00:39:00,089
No! All right! Anything.

477
00:39:00,256 --> 00:39:01,590
Thanks so much.

478
00:39:01,757 --> 00:39:03,551
Thank you. Hope
we can help you again.

479
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:06,554
Coming through! One class-five
free-roaming vapor.

480
00:39:06,762 --> 00:39:09,849
<i>Morning, I'm Roger Grimsby.
Today, the entire Eastern seaboard...</i>

481
00:39:10,016 --> 00:39:13,060
<i>...is alive with talk of incidents
of paranormal activity.</i>

482
00:39:13,269 --> 00:39:16,147
<i>Alleged ghost-sightings
and supernatural occurrences...</i>

483
00:39:16,313 --> 00:39:18,941
<i>...have been reported
across the entire tri-state area.</i>

484
00:39:19,108 --> 00:39:21,652
Everybody has heard ghost stories
around the campfire.

485
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:24,989
My grandma used to spin yarns
about a spectral locomotive...

486
00:39:25,156 --> 00:39:27,658
...that would rocket past the farm
where she grew up.

487
00:39:27,825 --> 00:39:29,910
But now, as if
some unforeseen authority...

488
00:39:50,306 --> 00:39:51,640
Stand aside, please!

489
00:39:51,807 --> 00:39:55,061
Hi, this is Larry King. The phone-in
topic, ghosts and ghostbusting.

490
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:57,772
The controversy builds,
more sightings are reported.

491
00:39:57,938 --> 00:39:59,440
Some maintain that these...

492
00:39:59,607 --> 00:40:03,319
...professional paranormal eliminators
in New York are the cause of it all.

493
00:40:08,824 --> 00:40:10,117
I got it! I got it!

494
00:40:11,827 --> 00:40:13,120
Pete! Ray!

495
00:40:22,046 --> 00:40:24,340
<i>Still making headlines
all across the country...</i>

496
00:40:24,507 --> 00:40:28,135
<i>...the Ghostbusters are at it again,
this time at the dance club...</i>

497
00:40:28,344 --> 00:40:32,098
<i>...The Rose. The boys in gray slugged
it out with a pesky poltergeist...</i>

498
00:40:32,264 --> 00:40:36,143
<i>...then stayed to dance with the ladies
who witnessed the disturbance.</i>

499
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:39,355
<i>This is Casey Kasem.
Now on with the countdown.</i>

500
00:40:39,522 --> 00:40:41,649
Twenty-four hours a day,
seven days a week.

501
00:40:41,857 --> 00:40:44,527
No job is too big. No fee is too big.

502
00:40:45,986 --> 00:40:48,489
Is it just a mist,
or does it have arms and legs?

503
00:40:48,656 --> 00:40:51,283
<i>As they say in TV, I'm sure
there's one big question...</i>

504
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:54,662
<i>...on everybody's mind and I imagine
you are the man to answer that.</i>

505
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:57,998
<i>How is Elvis,
and have you seen him lately?</i>

506
00:41:42,334 --> 00:41:44,545
Do you believe in UFOs,
astral projections...

507
00:41:44,712 --> 00:41:47,173
...mental telepathy, ESP,
clairvoyance...

508
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:50,384
...spirit photography,
telekinetic movement...

509
00:41:50,551 --> 00:41:55,431
...full-trance mediums, the Loch Ness
monster and the theory of Atlantis?

510
00:41:55,598 --> 00:41:59,727
If there's a steady paycheck in it,
I'll believe anything you say.

511
00:42:00,936 --> 00:42:03,898
I gotta get some sleep. I'm dying.

512
00:42:04,064 --> 00:42:05,482
You don't look good.

513
00:42:05,649 --> 00:42:07,568
- I don't?
- Well, you've looked better.

514
00:42:07,735 --> 00:42:09,403
You didn't used to look like this.

515
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:11,488
Can you hold, please?

516
00:42:11,655 --> 00:42:14,241
Here's the paper on the Brooklyn.
She paid with Visa.

517
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:16,535
Here's tonight's worksheet.

518
00:42:16,702 --> 00:42:18,370
Oh, great. Two more free repeaters.

519
00:42:18,537 --> 00:42:21,540
This is Winston Zeddmore.
He's here about the job.

520
00:42:21,707 --> 00:42:24,585
Beautiful. You're hired.
Ray Stantz, Pete Venkman.

521
00:42:24,752 --> 00:42:28,047
- Congratulations.
- Can you help me, please?

522
00:42:31,467 --> 00:42:32,968
Welcome aboard.

523
00:42:34,178 --> 00:42:36,597
I don't know where they get
these guest conductors.

524
00:42:36,764 --> 00:42:39,516
It's not gonna do him much good
to scream at us in German.

525
00:42:39,683 --> 00:42:43,062
Well, I don't think that the man
is competent to conduct...

526
00:42:43,229 --> 00:42:44,688
...a major symphony orchestra.

527
00:42:45,981 --> 00:42:51,028
- Could you wait here a minute?
- Sure.

528
00:42:56,408 --> 00:42:58,577
Dr. Venkman. This is a surprise.

529
00:42:58,744 --> 00:43:01,080
- That was a wonderful rehearsal.
- You heard that?

530
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:03,165
Yes. You're the best one in your row.

531
00:43:03,332 --> 00:43:04,792
Oh, thank you.

532
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,504
You're good. Most people can't hear
me with the whole orchestra playing.

533
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:10,297
I don't have to take this abuse.

534
00:43:10,506 --> 00:43:12,758
I got hundreds of people
dying to abuse me.

535
00:43:12,925 --> 00:43:14,969
I know. You're a big celebrity now.

536
00:43:15,135 --> 00:43:18,347
Do you have some information
for me on my case?

537
00:43:22,726 --> 00:43:24,353
Who's the stiff?

538
00:43:24,853 --> 00:43:28,065
The stiff happens to be one of
the finest musicians in the world.

539
00:43:28,232 --> 00:43:30,067
Do you have information
for me, please?

540
00:43:30,234 --> 00:43:32,778
Well, sure, but I prefer
to give it to you in private.

541
00:43:32,945 --> 00:43:36,282
- Why don't you tell me now?
- Okay. I found the name Zuul for you.

542
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:41,954
The name Zuul refers to a demigod
worshiped around 6000 B.C. by the...

543
00:43:42,329 --> 00:43:44,331
What's that word?

544
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:46,083
- "Hittites."
- Hittites...

545
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:49,336
...the Mesopotamians
and the Sumerians.

546
00:43:50,254 --> 00:43:52,715
"Zuul was the minion of Gozer."

547
00:43:52,881 --> 00:43:55,092
What's Gozer?

548
00:43:55,259 --> 00:43:59,471
- Gozer was very big in Sumeria.
- Well, what's he doing in my icebox?

549
00:43:59,638 --> 00:44:02,641
I'm working on that. If we could
get together Thursday night...

550
00:44:02,808 --> 00:44:06,145
...I'm thinking 9-ish, you know,
we could exchange information.

551
00:44:06,312 --> 00:44:09,606
I can't see you Thursday. I'm busy.

552
00:44:09,773 --> 00:44:13,193
Miss Barrett, you think there is
something wrong up here that says:

553
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:17,531
"He enjoys taking his evenings off
and spending it with his clients."

554
00:44:17,698 --> 00:44:20,617
No. I'm making a special exception
in your case...

555
00:44:20,784 --> 00:44:22,369
...because...

556
00:44:22,703 --> 00:44:24,038
...I respect you.

557
00:44:24,204 --> 00:44:26,332
It's corny, but I respect you
as an artist.

558
00:44:26,498 --> 00:44:30,377
As a dresser too. This is a magnificent
coordination you have going today.

559
00:44:30,586 --> 00:44:33,047
- See you Thursday.
- I'll bring the <i>Roylance Guide...</i>

560
00:44:33,213 --> 00:44:35,424
...and we'll eat and read.

561
00:44:42,097 --> 00:44:44,308
- So who the hell is that?
- He's just a friend.

562
00:44:44,475 --> 00:44:45,893
- A friend?
- An old friend.

563
00:44:46,101 --> 00:44:47,728
Bye! Well, I'll see you Thursday!

564
00:44:47,895 --> 00:44:51,607
I'm sorry I didn't get to meet you, sir.
I'm glad you're feeling much better.

565
00:44:51,774 --> 00:44:54,651
You're still very pale, though.
A little sun.

566
00:44:54,818 --> 00:44:57,488
- Well, what does he do?
- He's a scientist.

567
00:45:08,832 --> 00:45:13,003
This is where we store all the vapors
and entities and slimers that we trap.

568
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:18,550
Very simple, really. A loaded trap
here. Open, unlock the system.

569
00:45:18,717 --> 00:45:20,052
Insert the trap.

570
00:45:21,929 --> 00:45:23,889
Release.

571
00:45:24,807 --> 00:45:28,435
Close, lock the system.
Set your entry grid.

572
00:45:28,644 --> 00:45:30,062
Neutronize your field.

573
00:45:30,396 --> 00:45:32,189
And...

574
00:45:32,356 --> 00:45:34,983
...when the light is green,
the trap is clean.

575
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:38,112
The ghost is incarcerated here
in our custom storage facility.

576
00:45:38,278 --> 00:45:41,865
There's a man from the EPA here
to see you. He's waiting in your office.

577
00:45:42,032 --> 00:45:44,660
- EPA? What's he want?
- I don't know.

578
00:45:44,827 --> 00:45:47,830
All I do know is I've been working
two weeks without a break...

579
00:45:47,996 --> 00:45:50,707
...and you promised me
you'd hire more help.

580
00:45:50,874 --> 00:45:53,210
Janine, someone
with your qualifications...

581
00:45:53,377 --> 00:45:57,256
...would have no trouble finding
a topflight job in either...

582
00:45:57,423 --> 00:46:00,259
...the food service or
housekeeping industries.

583
00:46:01,009 --> 00:46:05,097
- Are you gonna answer that?
- I've quit better jobs than this.

584
00:46:05,806 --> 00:46:07,724
Ghostbusters! What do you want?

585
00:46:07,891 --> 00:46:10,477
- Can I help you?
- I'm Walter Peck.

586
00:46:10,686 --> 00:46:14,314
I represent the Environmental
Protection Agency, the third district.

587
00:46:14,481 --> 00:46:16,984
Great. How's it going down there?

588
00:46:19,236 --> 00:46:21,196
Are you Peter Venkman?

589
00:46:22,197 --> 00:46:23,782
Yes, I'm...

590
00:46:23,949 --> 00:46:25,284
...Dr. Venkman.

591
00:46:25,451 --> 00:46:28,245
Exactly what are you a doctor of,
Mr. Venkman?

592
00:46:28,412 --> 00:46:31,832
Well, I have Ph.D.'s in parapsychology
and psychology.

593
00:46:32,583 --> 00:46:34,418
I see.

594
00:46:34,585 --> 00:46:37,463
And now you catch ghosts.

595
00:46:37,629 --> 00:46:39,631
Yeah. You could say that.

596
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:42,634
And how many ghosts have you
caught, Mr. Venkman?

597
00:46:42,801 --> 00:46:45,471
- I'm not at liberty to say.
- And where do you put...

598
00:46:45,637 --> 00:46:48,515
...these ghosts
once you catch them?

599
00:46:48,724 --> 00:46:51,143
Into a storage facility.

600
00:46:51,518 --> 00:46:54,646
And would this storage facility
be located on these premises?

601
00:46:54,813 --> 00:46:59,485
- Yes.
- And may I see this storage facility?

602
00:46:59,651 --> 00:47:03,030
- No.
- And why not, Mr. Venkman?

603
00:47:04,573 --> 00:47:07,826
Because you did not use
the magic word.

604
00:47:10,078 --> 00:47:13,749
What is the magic word,
Mr. Venkman?

605
00:47:15,083 --> 00:47:16,418
"Please."

606
00:47:17,794 --> 00:47:21,548
May I please see the storage facility,
Mr. Venkman?

607
00:47:21,757 --> 00:47:23,217
Why do you want to see it?

608
00:47:23,383 --> 00:47:25,677
Well, because I'm curious.

609
00:47:25,969 --> 00:47:28,263
I want to know more about
what you do here.

610
00:47:28,847 --> 00:47:31,266
There've been a lot of wild
stories in the media...

611
00:47:31,433 --> 00:47:34,353
...and we want to assess
any possible environmental impact...

612
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:35,854
...from your operation.

613
00:47:36,021 --> 00:47:38,065
For instance, the presence
of noxious...

614
00:47:38,273 --> 00:47:41,527
...possibly hazardous waste chemicals
in your basement.

615
00:47:41,693 --> 00:47:45,906
Now, you show me what is down there,
or I come back with a court order.

616
00:47:46,907 --> 00:47:50,994
You go get a court order, and I'll sue
your ass for wrongful prosecution!

617
00:47:51,787 --> 00:47:54,540
You can have it your way,
Mr. Venkman.

618
00:47:55,123 --> 00:47:57,626
I'm worried. It's crowded in there,
and my data...

619
00:47:57,793 --> 00:48:00,587
...points to something big
on the horizon.

620
00:48:00,796 --> 00:48:02,714
What do you mean, "big"?

621
00:48:03,298 --> 00:48:07,719
Well, let's say this Twinkie
represents the normal amount...

622
00:48:07,886 --> 00:48:10,430
...of psychokinetic energy
in the New York area.

623
00:48:10,597 --> 00:48:14,351
According to this morning's sample,
it would be a Twinkie...

624
00:48:14,518 --> 00:48:18,063
...35 feet long, weighing
approximately 600 pounds.

625
00:48:19,481 --> 00:48:21,149
That's a big Twinkie.

626
00:48:21,316 --> 00:48:23,735
We could be on the verge
of a fourfold cross-rip...

627
00:48:23,902 --> 00:48:27,239
...a PKE surge of incredible,
even dangerous, proportions.

628
00:48:27,823 --> 00:48:31,285
We just had a visit from the
Environmental Protection Agency.

629
00:48:31,451 --> 00:48:33,620
- How's the grid holding up?
- Not good.

630
00:48:33,829 --> 00:48:35,664
Tell him about the Twinkie.

631
00:48:36,623 --> 00:48:38,166
What about the Twinkie?

632
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:35,682
- Oh, Dana, it's you.
- Hello, Louis.

633
00:49:35,891 --> 00:49:38,685
You gotta come in here.
You're missing a classic party.

634
00:49:38,894 --> 00:49:43,023
Yes, well, I would, Louis,
but I have a date coming over.

635
00:49:46,234 --> 00:49:47,861
You made a date...

636
00:49:48,028 --> 00:49:54,284
- ...tonight?
- Well, I'm sorry, Louis. I forgot.

637
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:59,081
Oh, that's okay.
You can bring him along.

638
00:49:59,539 --> 00:50:02,709
All right. Maybe we'll stop by, okay?

639
00:50:02,918 --> 00:50:04,670
That's great. I'll tell everybody.

640
00:50:04,836 --> 00:50:07,798
We're gonna play Twister,
we're gonna do some break dancing...

641
00:50:07,964 --> 00:50:09,758
Hey...

642
00:50:10,592 --> 00:50:14,388
Hey, let me in! It's Louis!
Somebody, let me in!

643
00:50:39,496 --> 00:50:41,039
Hello?

644
00:50:41,206 --> 00:50:43,291
Hi, Mom.

645
00:50:43,458 --> 00:50:45,127
I've been busy.

646
00:50:45,293 --> 00:50:47,796
Well... No, everything is fine.

647
00:50:47,963 --> 00:50:51,174
Yeah. No, just that one time.

648
00:50:51,341 --> 00:50:53,427
Oh, I am.

649
00:50:54,302 --> 00:50:56,054
I will.

650
00:50:57,305 --> 00:51:01,977
I won't. Mom, I have to go.
I have a date.

651
00:51:02,227 --> 00:51:06,356
Yes. No, no one you know. It's...

652
00:51:07,315 --> 00:51:10,110
Well, he's a Ghostbuster.

653
00:51:10,694 --> 00:51:12,863
Those guys on TV.

654
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:15,615
Yes, well, I'll have to let you know.

655
00:51:15,782 --> 00:51:18,243
Okay. Love to Dad.

656
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:21,997
Right. Bye. Bye.

657
00:51:42,392 --> 00:51:44,436
Oh, shit.

658
00:52:15,926 --> 00:52:19,179
Do you have any Excedrin
or Extra Strength Tylenol?

659
00:52:19,346 --> 00:52:22,557
Gee, I think all I got is
acetylsalicylic acid. Generic.

660
00:52:22,724 --> 00:52:26,561
I can get 600 tablets of that for the
same price as 300 of the name brand.

661
00:52:26,728 --> 00:52:28,980
Makes good financial sense.
Good advice.

662
00:52:29,147 --> 00:52:31,817
This is real smoked salmon
from Nova Scotia, Canada...

663
00:52:31,983 --> 00:52:33,318
...24.95 a pound.

664
00:52:33,485 --> 00:52:35,570
It only cost me 14.12
after tax, though.

665
00:52:35,737 --> 00:52:37,656
I'm giving this as
a promotional expense.

666
00:52:37,823 --> 00:52:41,743
That's why I invited clients instead
of friends. Having a good time, Marv?

667
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:44,579
How you doing? Have some Brie.
It's at room temperature.

668
00:52:44,746 --> 00:52:46,414
You think it's too warm for Brie?

669
00:52:46,581 --> 00:52:48,750
Louis, I'm going home.

670
00:52:48,917 --> 00:52:51,586
Don't leave yet. Listen,
maybe if we start dancing...

671
00:52:51,753 --> 00:52:53,755
...other people will join in.

672
00:52:53,922 --> 00:52:55,757
Okay.

673
00:52:58,552 --> 00:53:01,429
Oh, don't move.
I just gotta get the door.

674
00:53:02,848 --> 00:53:04,558
- Ted! Annette!
- Hi.

675
00:53:04,724 --> 00:53:07,102
I'm glad you could come.
Give me your coats.

676
00:53:07,269 --> 00:53:09,729
Everybody, this is Ted
and Annette Fleming.

677
00:53:09,896 --> 00:53:11,231
How are you?

678
00:53:11,398 --> 00:53:14,234
Ted has a small carpet-cleaning
business in receivership.

679
00:53:14,401 --> 00:53:17,654
Annette's drawing a salary from
a deferred bonus from two years ago.

680
00:53:17,821 --> 00:53:21,867
They got 15,000 left
on the house at 8 percent.

681
00:53:22,033 --> 00:53:24,411
So they're okay!

682
00:53:24,578 --> 00:53:26,830
Does anybody want
to play Parcheesi?

683
00:53:29,958 --> 00:53:31,751
Okay, who brought the dog?

684
00:53:53,648 --> 00:53:58,695
Help! There's a bear loose
in my apartment! Help! Help!

685
00:54:01,072 --> 00:54:02,449
Help!

686
00:54:02,616 --> 00:54:05,660
- What?
- A bear in his apartment.

687
00:54:10,081 --> 00:54:12,375
I'm gonna bring this up
at the tenants' meeting.

688
00:54:12,542 --> 00:54:15,754
There's not supposed to be
any pets in the building.

689
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:35,523
Let me in. There's gotta be a way
in here. I gotta get...

690
00:54:38,735 --> 00:54:41,613
Somebody, let me in!

691
00:54:47,911 --> 00:54:49,245
Nice doggy.

692
00:54:49,412 --> 00:54:51,373
Cute little pooch.

693
00:54:51,539 --> 00:54:54,417
Maybe I got a Milk-Bone.

694
00:55:13,895 --> 00:55:15,814
- What happened?
- Some moron brought...

695
00:55:15,981 --> 00:55:19,067
...a cougar to a party,
and it went berserk.

696
00:55:20,902 --> 00:55:24,280
Hi, I'm going up to Dana Barrett's.
Okay.

697
00:55:43,466 --> 00:55:45,510
Hello?

698
00:55:48,013 --> 00:55:50,557
That's a different look for you,
isn't it?

699
00:55:50,724 --> 00:55:52,767
Are you the Keymaster?

700
00:55:54,561 --> 00:55:56,646
Not that I know of.

701
00:56:08,616 --> 00:56:10,618
Are you the Keymaster?

702
00:56:10,785 --> 00:56:12,120
Yes.

703
00:56:12,495 --> 00:56:15,457
I'm a friend of his.
He told me to meet him here.

704
00:56:16,124 --> 00:56:18,668
- I didn't get your name.
- I am Zuul.

705
00:56:18,835 --> 00:56:21,004
I am the Gatekeeper.

706
00:56:26,801 --> 00:56:31,639
- What are we doing today, Zuul?
- Prepare for the coming of Gozer.

707
00:56:32,432 --> 00:56:33,975
Gozer, huh?

708
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:36,811
The Destructor.

709
00:56:45,028 --> 00:56:46,362
Are we still going out?

710
00:56:49,491 --> 00:56:53,078
You know, you could pick up the place
if you're expecting someone.

711
00:56:53,745 --> 00:56:56,664
Do you want this body?

712
00:56:57,332 --> 00:56:58,792
Is this a trick question?

713
00:57:02,337 --> 00:57:04,672
I guess the roses worked, huh?

714
00:57:04,839 --> 00:57:06,883
Take me now...

715
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:08,676
...sub-creature.

716
00:57:08,843 --> 00:57:10,678
We never talk anymore.

717
00:57:11,429 --> 00:57:16,810
Easy. I make it a rule never to get
involved with possessed people.

718
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:20,855
It's more of a guideline than a rule.

719
00:57:21,022 --> 00:57:22,440
You know, I can...

720
00:57:22,607 --> 00:57:25,026
I want you inside me.

721
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:27,946
Go ahead. No, I can't.

722
00:57:28,113 --> 00:57:30,824
Sounds like you got at least
two people in there already.

723
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:32,826
Might be a little crowded.

724
00:57:32,992 --> 00:57:35,245
Come on, why don't you
just quit trying...

725
00:57:35,411 --> 00:57:38,540
...to upset and disturb Dr. Venkman
and just relax.

726
00:57:38,706 --> 00:57:42,252
Lie down there. Relax.
Put your hands on your chest.

727
00:57:42,418 --> 00:57:45,255
What I'd really like to do
is talk to Dana.

728
00:57:45,421 --> 00:57:47,298
I want to talk to Dana.

729
00:57:47,465 --> 00:57:48,883
Dana, it's Peter.

730
00:57:49,050 --> 00:57:52,762
There is no Dana.
There is only Zuul.

731
00:57:52,971 --> 00:57:54,889
Oh, Zuulie, you nut. Come on.

732
00:57:55,473 --> 00:57:57,809
Come on, I want to talk
to Dana. Dana.

733
00:57:57,976 --> 00:58:00,353
Just relax. Come on. Dana.

734
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:02,397
Dana. Can I talk to Dana?

735
00:58:02,564 --> 00:58:06,317
There is no Dana, only Zuul.

736
00:58:06,484 --> 00:58:09,070
What a lovely singing voice
you must have.

737
00:58:09,237 --> 00:58:11,239
Now, I'm gonna count
to three, Zuulie.

738
00:58:11,406 --> 00:58:12,991
And if I don't talk to Dana...

739
00:58:13,741 --> 00:58:16,870
...there's gonna be some real trouble
in this apartment, I think.

740
00:58:17,036 --> 00:58:18,454
One.

741
00:58:20,832 --> 00:58:22,500
Two.

742
00:58:24,085 --> 00:58:25,753
Two and a half.

743
00:59:09,464 --> 00:59:11,174
Please come down.

744
00:59:13,176 --> 00:59:18,640
I am the Keymaster.
The Destructor is coming.

745
00:59:18,806 --> 00:59:21,893
The Traveler. The Destroyer.

746
00:59:27,732 --> 00:59:29,442
Gatekeeper.

747
00:59:35,156 --> 00:59:36,491
I am Vinz.

748
00:59:36,658 --> 00:59:39,077
Vinz Clortho, Keymaster of Gozer.

749
00:59:39,244 --> 00:59:42,830
Volguus Zildrohar, Lord of the
Sebouillia. Are you the Gatekeeper?

750
00:59:42,997 --> 00:59:45,959
He pulls the wagon, I make
the deals. You want a ride?

751
00:59:55,176 --> 00:59:58,846
Wait for the sign.
Then all prisoners will be released.

752
00:59:59,013 --> 01:00:02,600
You will perish in flame,
you and all your kind! Gatekeeper!

753
01:00:02,976 --> 01:00:04,310
What an asshole.

754
01:00:10,733 --> 01:00:13,528
- Dropping off or picking up?
- Dropping off.

755
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:15,697
Just a moment.

756
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,910
- You a Ghostbuster?
- Yes.

757
01:00:21,077 --> 01:00:23,371
We picked up this guy.
We don't know what to do.

758
01:00:23,538 --> 01:00:26,040
Bellevue doesn't want him.
I'm afraid to lock him up.

759
01:00:26,207 --> 01:00:29,127
I know you guys are into this stuff,
so I figured we'd check.

760
01:00:29,294 --> 01:00:30,878
All right.

761
01:00:33,923 --> 01:00:36,050
Are you the Gatekeeper?

762
01:00:39,053 --> 01:00:41,389
You better bring him inside.

763
01:00:42,515 --> 01:00:45,018
You are so kind to take
care of that man.

764
01:00:45,184 --> 01:00:47,061
You know, you are
a real humanitarian.

765
01:00:47,228 --> 01:00:49,689
I don't think he's human.

766
01:00:57,655 --> 01:00:59,198
What did you say your name was?

767
01:01:00,241 --> 01:01:02,410
Vinz Clortho, Keymaster of Gozer.

768
01:01:02,577 --> 01:01:04,746
According to this,
his name's Louis Tully.

769
01:01:04,912 --> 01:01:07,332
Lives on Central Park West.

770
01:01:09,042 --> 01:01:11,502
Do you want some coffee, Mr. Tully?

771
01:01:11,753 --> 01:01:13,713
- Do I?
- Yes, have some.

772
01:01:13,921 --> 01:01:16,215
Yes, have some.

773
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:20,595
Vinz, you said before you
were waiting for a sign.

774
01:01:20,762 --> 01:01:23,514
- What sign are you waiting for?
- Gozer the Traveler.

775
01:01:23,681 --> 01:01:25,933
He will come in one
of the pre-chosen forms.

776
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:30,355
During rectification of the Vuldronaii,
the Traveler came as a large Torb.

777
01:01:30,938 --> 01:01:34,275
Then, during the third reconciliation
of the Meketrex supplicants...

778
01:01:34,442 --> 01:01:37,779
...they chose a new form for him,
that of a giant Sloar!

779
01:01:37,945 --> 01:01:40,448
Many Shubs and Zuuls knew
what it was to be roasted...

780
01:01:40,656 --> 01:01:43,284
...in the depths of the Sloar that day,
I can tell you.

781
01:01:43,451 --> 01:01:46,788
- Egon.
- Excuse me.

782
01:01:48,790 --> 01:01:51,959
There's something very strange
about that man.

783
01:01:54,170 --> 01:01:56,923
I'm usually very psychic,
and I have a terrible feeling...

784
01:01:57,090 --> 01:02:00,176
...that something awful
is gonna happen to you.

785
01:02:01,052 --> 01:02:03,679
I'm afraid you're gonna die.

786
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,266
I'll get it.

787
01:02:09,977 --> 01:02:12,230
- Hello?
<i>- Egon, it's Peter.</i>

788
01:02:12,397 --> 01:02:15,650
- Thanks, I've got it.
- I have news from the world of Gozer.

789
01:02:15,817 --> 01:02:18,986
<i>- What is it, Peter?</i>
- I'm here with Dana Barrett.

790
01:02:19,153 --> 01:02:21,781
It seems the Goz has been
putting some moves...

791
01:02:21,948 --> 01:02:24,992
- ...on my would-be girlfriend.
<i>- How is she?</i>

792
01:02:25,159 --> 01:02:28,663
I think we can get her
a guest shot on <i>Wild Kingdom.</i>

793
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:31,791
I just whacked her up
with about 300 cc's of Thorazine.

794
01:02:31,958 --> 01:02:36,087
She's gonna take a little nap now,
but she says she's the Gatekeeper.

795
01:02:36,254 --> 01:02:38,673
- Does that make any sense to you?
- Some.

796
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:41,426
I just met the Keymaster.
He's here with me now.

797
01:02:41,592 --> 01:02:44,345
Oh, wonderful. We have
to get these two together.

798
01:02:46,848 --> 01:02:49,267
I think that would be
extraordinarily dangerous.

799
01:02:49,434 --> 01:02:52,770
Okay, well, hold onto him.
I'll be there in a little while.

800
01:02:52,937 --> 01:02:55,148
Good.

801
01:02:55,314 --> 01:03:00,236
Thank you, Vinz. We have to find Ray.
I need him here immediately.

802
01:03:04,782 --> 01:03:08,202
Bad news, honey, I gotta go to work.

803
01:03:08,369 --> 01:03:11,247
Hey, will you stay here in bed
until I get back?

804
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:25,219
- Hey, Ray, do you believe in God?
- Never met him.

805
01:03:25,386 --> 01:03:29,891
Yeah, well, I do. And I love
Jesus' style, you know?

806
01:03:30,057 --> 01:03:34,020
This roof cap is made of
a magnesium-tungsten alloy.

807
01:03:34,187 --> 01:03:36,522
What are you so involved
with there?

808
01:03:36,689 --> 01:03:40,026
These are blueprints for the ironwork
in Dana Barrett's apartment...

809
01:03:40,193 --> 01:03:42,987
...and they're very, very strange.

810
01:03:43,154 --> 01:03:46,699
Hey, Ray, do you remember
something in the Bible about...

811
01:03:46,866 --> 01:03:50,870
...the last days, when the dead
would rise from the grave?

812
01:03:51,287 --> 01:03:54,081
I remember Revelations 7:12.

813
01:03:54,582 --> 01:03:56,709
And I looked as he opened
the sixth seal.

814
01:03:56,876 --> 01:03:58,836
And behold, there was
a great earthquake.

815
01:03:59,003 --> 01:04:01,422
And the sun became
as black as sackcloth.

816
01:04:01,797 --> 01:04:03,341
And the moon became as blood.

817
01:04:03,508 --> 01:04:06,427
And the seas boiled.
And the skies fell.

818
01:04:08,221 --> 01:04:11,098
- Judgment day.
- Judgment day.

819
01:04:11,265 --> 01:04:14,268
Every ancient religion has its myth
about the end of the world.

820
01:04:14,435 --> 01:04:18,105
Myth? Ray, has it ever
occurred to you...

821
01:04:18,314 --> 01:04:20,441
...maybe the reason
we've been so busy...

822
01:04:20,608 --> 01:04:23,736
...is because the dead have
been rising from the grave?

823
01:04:28,824 --> 01:04:33,329
- How about a little music?
- Yeah.

824
01:05:12,243 --> 01:05:13,786
This way.

825
01:05:22,336 --> 01:05:26,799
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Just where do you think you're going?

826
01:05:26,966 --> 01:05:30,136
Step aside, or you'll be arrested
for interfering with the police.

827
01:05:30,303 --> 01:05:32,847
No. Hold on. I've seen TV.
You can't come in here...

828
01:05:33,014 --> 01:05:34,515
...without a warrant or a writ.

829
01:05:34,682 --> 01:05:37,810
Cease and Desist All Commerce
order. Seizure of Premises.

830
01:05:37,977 --> 01:05:40,771
Ban of Public Utilities
for Non-Licensed Waste Handlers...

831
01:05:40,938 --> 01:05:43,691
...and a federal
Entry and Inspection order.

832
01:05:44,609 --> 01:05:46,944
Vinz, there's one more test
I'd like to perform.

833
01:05:47,111 --> 01:05:51,365
Egon. I tried to stop them.
He says they have a warrant.

834
01:05:51,532 --> 01:05:55,202
- Excuse me, this is private property.
- Shut this off. Shut these all off.

835
01:05:55,411 --> 01:05:58,122
I'm warning you. Turning off these
machines is hazardous.

836
01:05:58,289 --> 01:06:00,791
I'll tell you hazardous.
You're facing prosecution...

837
01:06:00,958 --> 01:06:03,169
...for a half-a-dozen
environmental violations.

838
01:06:03,336 --> 01:06:05,880
You shut off these beams,
or we shut them off for you.

839
01:06:10,635 --> 01:06:13,471
Understand, this is a high-voltage
laser containment system.

840
01:06:13,638 --> 01:06:16,390
Turning it off would be
like dropping a bomb in the city.

841
01:06:16,557 --> 01:06:19,894
Don't patronize me. I'm not stupid,
like the people you bilk.

842
01:06:20,061 --> 01:06:23,481
At ease, officer. I'm Peter Venkman.
There's been a misunderstanding...

843
01:06:23,648 --> 01:06:25,733
...and I want to cooperate
in any way I can.

844
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:28,319
Forget it. You had your chance
to cooperate...

845
01:06:28,486 --> 01:06:32,239
...but you thought it'd be more fun to
insult me. Now it is my turn, wise-ass.

846
01:06:32,406 --> 01:06:34,408
He wants to shut down
the protection grid.

847
01:06:34,575 --> 01:06:37,244
You shut that thing down,
we won't be held responsible...

848
01:06:37,411 --> 01:06:41,165
- You'll be responsible. Shut it off.
- No, we won't be held responsible.

849
01:06:41,332 --> 01:06:44,335
Don't shut it off. I'm warning you.

850
01:06:45,461 --> 01:06:48,089
I've never seen anything like this.
I don't know...

851
01:06:48,255 --> 01:06:51,759
Yeah, I'm not interested in
your opinion. Just shut it off.

852
01:06:53,094 --> 01:06:55,096
My friend, don't be a jerk.

853
01:06:55,262 --> 01:06:57,890
- Step aside.
- If he does that again, you shoot him.

854
01:06:58,057 --> 01:07:00,226
You do your job.
Don't tell me how to do mine.

855
01:07:00,393 --> 01:07:03,104
- Thank you, officer.
- Shut it off!

856
01:07:25,793 --> 01:07:27,253
Oh, shit.

857
01:07:42,309 --> 01:07:44,979
Clear the building!

858
01:08:14,258 --> 01:08:17,011
This is it. This is the sign.

859
01:08:17,178 --> 01:08:21,098
Yeah, it's a sign, all right.
We're going out of business.

860
01:08:31,066 --> 01:08:33,110
Hey, aim up there.

861
01:08:33,569 --> 01:08:35,488
- What happened?
- Storage facility blew.

862
01:08:35,654 --> 01:08:38,199
- He shut off the protection grid.
- Oh, great.

863
01:08:38,365 --> 01:08:40,159
- That's bad, isn't it?
- Yeah.

864
01:08:40,326 --> 01:08:42,870
- Where's the Keymaster?
- Shit.

865
01:08:43,078 --> 01:08:45,372
- Who's the Keymaster?
- Oh, come on.

866
01:08:45,706 --> 01:08:48,501
Hold it. I want this man arrested.

867
01:08:48,667 --> 01:08:52,129
These men are in criminal violation
of the Environmental Protection Act.

868
01:08:52,296 --> 01:08:54,882
- This explosion is a direct result of it.
- Your mother!

869
01:08:55,090 --> 01:08:57,384
Come on, hold it! Hold it! Hold it!

870
01:09:41,762 --> 01:09:47,768
Columbia Building, 57th Street.
I'm in a hurry, so let's not dawdle.

871
01:10:41,989 --> 01:10:44,158
Hey, guard!

872
01:10:44,325 --> 01:10:46,660
Look, I want to make a phone call.

873
01:10:46,827 --> 01:10:49,330
I just work with these guys.
I wasn't even there.

874
01:10:49,496 --> 01:10:52,666
The structure of this roof cap
is like the telemetry tracker...

875
01:10:52,833 --> 01:10:56,837
...that NASA uses to identify
dead pulsars in deep space.

876
01:10:57,004 --> 01:11:03,010
Cold-riveted girders
with cores of pure selenium.

877
01:11:03,218 --> 01:11:05,346
Everybody getting this so far?

878
01:11:05,512 --> 01:11:08,807
So what? I guess they just don't
make them like they used to.

879
01:11:08,974 --> 01:11:11,310
No. Nobody ever made
them like this.

880
01:11:11,477 --> 01:11:16,190
The architect was either a certified
genius or an authentic wacko.

881
01:11:16,357 --> 01:11:19,443
Ray, for a moment...

882
01:11:19,610 --> 01:11:22,696
...pretend that I don't know
anything about metallurgy...

883
01:11:22,863 --> 01:11:28,160
...engineering or physics and just
tell me what the hell is going on.

884
01:11:28,452 --> 01:11:30,371
You never studied.

885
01:11:30,955 --> 01:11:34,792
The whole building is a huge
superconductive antenna...

886
01:11:34,959 --> 01:11:37,378
...that was designed and
built for the purpose...

887
01:11:37,544 --> 01:11:40,714
...of pulling in and concentrating
spiritual turbulence.

888
01:11:40,881 --> 01:11:46,553
Your girlfriend lives in the
corner penthouse of spook central.

889
01:11:48,055 --> 01:11:50,557
She's not my girlfriend.

890
01:11:50,724 --> 01:11:54,228
I find her interesting because she's
a client and sleeps above her covers.

891
01:11:54,395 --> 01:11:58,399
Four feet above her covers.
She barks. She drools. She claws.

892
01:11:58,565 --> 01:12:01,026
It's not the girl, Peter,
it's the building.

893
01:12:01,193 --> 01:12:05,239
Something terrible is about to enter
our world. This building is the door.

894
01:12:05,406 --> 01:12:07,366
The architect's name
was Ivo Shandor.

895
01:12:07,533 --> 01:12:11,161
I found it in <i>Tobin's Spirit Guide.</i>
He was also a doctor.

896
01:12:11,328 --> 01:12:13,831
He performed a lot
of unnecessary surgery.

897
01:12:13,998 --> 01:12:16,875
And then, in 1920,
he started a secret society.

898
01:12:17,042 --> 01:12:20,838
- Let me guess. Gozer worshipers.
- Right.

899
01:12:21,714 --> 01:12:23,215
No studying.

900
01:12:23,382 --> 01:12:28,929
After World War I, Shandor decided
that society was too sick to survive.

901
01:12:32,433 --> 01:12:35,602
He wasn't alone. He had close
to a thousand followers when he died.

902
01:12:35,811 --> 01:12:37,730
They conducted rituals
up on the roof...

903
01:12:37,896 --> 01:12:41,442
...bizarre rituals intended to bring
about the end of the world.

904
01:12:41,608 --> 01:12:44,611
And now it looks like
it may actually happen.

905
01:12:51,452 --> 01:12:54,121
We have to get out of here
and find a judge or something.

906
01:12:54,329 --> 01:12:57,791
Hey, wait a minute.
Hey, hey, hey. Hold it.

907
01:12:58,125 --> 01:13:00,127
Are we going to go
before a judge to say...

908
01:13:00,294 --> 01:13:03,547
...that a Babylonian god is
gonna drop in on Central Park West...

909
01:13:03,714 --> 01:13:06,800
- ...and start tearing up the city?
- Sumerian, not Babylonian.

910
01:13:06,967 --> 01:13:09,636
- Yeah, big difference.
- No offense...

911
01:13:09,845 --> 01:13:11,472
...but I gotta get my own lawyer.

912
01:13:11,638 --> 01:13:14,266
Okay, Ghostbusters.
The mayor wants to see you guys.

913
01:13:14,433 --> 01:13:16,351
The whole island's going crazy.
Let's go.

914
01:13:16,643 --> 01:13:19,646
I gotta split. The mayor wants to
rap with me about some things.

915
01:13:43,670 --> 01:13:47,341
- I am the Keymaster.
- I am the Gatekeeper.

916
01:14:29,675 --> 01:14:34,221
- Back. Back. Stay back.
- Stay back. Stay back.

917
01:14:41,645 --> 01:14:44,731
I've got a city blowing up,
and you aren't giving me answers.

918
01:14:44,940 --> 01:14:47,901
We're blocking the bridges,
the roads...

919
01:14:48,068 --> 01:14:49,570
The Ghostbusters are here.

920
01:14:49,736 --> 01:14:52,489
The Ghostbusters.
Okay, the Ghostbusters.

921
01:14:52,656 --> 01:14:54,241
Hey, and where's this Peck?

922
01:14:54,408 --> 01:14:58,495
Peck. I am Walter Peck, sir, and
I am prepared to make a full report.

923
01:14:58,662 --> 01:15:01,039
These men are consummate
snowball artists.

924
01:15:01,206 --> 01:15:04,001
They use sense and nerve gases
to induce hallucinations.

925
01:15:04,168 --> 01:15:07,504
People think they're seeing ghosts,
and they call these bozos...

926
01:15:07,671 --> 01:15:10,090
...who show up to deal
with the problem...

927
01:15:10,257 --> 01:15:12,092
...with a fake electronic light show.

928
01:15:12,259 --> 01:15:15,095
Everything was fine with our system
until the power grid...

929
01:15:15,262 --> 01:15:18,891
- ...was shut off by dickless here.
- They caused an explosion.

930
01:15:19,057 --> 01:15:24,188
- Is this true?
- Yes, it's true. This man has no dick.

931
01:15:25,772 --> 01:15:29,735
Hey, come on. Knock it off.
Hey, break it up!

932
01:15:29,902 --> 01:15:31,737
- All right.
- Well, that's what I heard.

933
01:15:31,904 --> 01:15:33,363
This is City Hall.

934
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:36,575
Now, what am I gonna do here, John?
What is this?

935
01:15:36,742 --> 01:15:39,453
All I know is that was no light show
we saw this morning.

936
01:15:39,620 --> 01:15:43,540
I've seen every form
of combustion known to man...

937
01:15:43,707 --> 01:15:45,584
...but this beats the hell out of me.

938
01:15:45,751 --> 01:15:48,212
The walls in the 53rd Precinct
were bleeding.

939
01:15:48,378 --> 01:15:50,881
- How do you explain that?
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.

940
01:15:51,048 --> 01:15:52,633
Oh, Your Eminence.

941
01:15:58,597 --> 01:16:01,225
- How are you, Lenny?
- You're looking good, Mike.

942
01:16:01,391 --> 01:16:04,978
We're in a real fix here.
What do you think I should do?

943
01:16:05,145 --> 01:16:08,065
Officially, the church
will not take any position...

944
01:16:08,232 --> 01:16:11,610
...on the religious implications
of these phenomena.

945
01:16:11,777 --> 01:16:13,278
Personally, Lenny...

946
01:16:13,737 --> 01:16:17,658
...I think it's a sign from God.
But don't quote me on that.

947
01:16:18,033 --> 01:16:19,493
That's a smart move, Mike.

948
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:21,328
I won't call a press conference...

949
01:16:21,536 --> 01:16:24,331
...and tell everyone to start praying.

950
01:16:26,333 --> 01:16:29,127
I'm Winston Zeddmore, Your Honor.

951
01:16:29,294 --> 01:16:31,672
I've only been with the company
for a couple weeks.

952
01:16:31,838 --> 01:16:34,508
But I gotta tell you,
these things are real.

953
01:16:34,841 --> 01:16:38,679
Since I joined these men,
I have seen shit that'll turn you white.

954
01:16:39,554 --> 01:16:41,181
Well, you can believe Mr. Pecker.

955
01:16:41,348 --> 01:16:43,850
- My name is Peck.
- Or you could accept the fact...

956
01:16:44,059 --> 01:16:47,437
...that this city is headed for
a disaster of biblical proportions.

957
01:16:47,604 --> 01:16:51,316
- Well, what do you mean, "biblical"?
- What he means is Old Testament.

958
01:16:51,483 --> 01:16:53,610
- Real wrath-of-God-type stuff.
- Exactly.

959
01:16:53,777 --> 01:16:57,197
Fire and brimstone down from
the skies. Rivers and seas boiling.

960
01:16:57,364 --> 01:16:59,825
Forty years of darkness.
Earthquakes. Volcanoes.

961
01:16:59,992 --> 01:17:02,160
- Dead rising from the grave.
- Human sacrifice.

962
01:17:02,327 --> 01:17:05,539
Dogs and cats living together.
Mass hysteria.

963
01:17:05,706 --> 01:17:07,874
Enough! I get the point.

964
01:17:09,710 --> 01:17:11,044
But what if you're wrong?

965
01:17:11,211 --> 01:17:14,548
If I'm wrong, nothing happens.
We go to jail, peacefully, quietly.

966
01:17:14,715 --> 01:17:18,218
We'll enjoy it. But if I'm right...

967
01:17:18,385 --> 01:17:21,555
...and we can stop this thing...

968
01:17:21,722 --> 01:17:27,144
Lenny, you will have
saved the lives...

969
01:17:27,311 --> 01:17:31,565
...of millions of registered voters.

970
01:17:37,029 --> 01:17:40,907
I don't believe you're seriously
considering listening to these men.

971
01:17:48,248 --> 01:17:50,751
Get him out of here.

972
01:17:50,917 --> 01:17:53,545
- Bye.
- I'll fix you. I'm gonna fix you.

973
01:17:53,712 --> 01:17:56,548
I'll get you a nice fruit basket.
I'm going to miss him.

974
01:17:56,715 --> 01:17:58,133
All right. All right.

975
01:17:58,675 --> 01:18:02,054
We got work to do. Now,
what do you need from me?

976
01:18:15,942 --> 01:18:17,944
Come on, let's run some red lights!

977
01:19:20,841 --> 01:19:22,759
Hello, New York.

978
01:19:28,932 --> 01:19:31,685
Hello, everybody!

979
01:19:31,852 --> 01:19:35,188
Dr. Ray Stantz, would you please?
The heart of the Ghostbusters.

980
01:19:35,355 --> 01:19:38,525
Thank you. They love you.
They love you here.

981
01:19:39,109 --> 01:19:43,655
- I like that shirt, friend.
- Ghostbusters! All right!

982
01:19:46,324 --> 01:19:49,453
Gotta run. Got a date with a ghost.

983
01:19:49,619 --> 01:19:52,372
Okay, whatever happens,
let's be professional.

984
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:27,073
We might have to put a little
overtime in on this one.

985
01:21:22,045 --> 01:21:25,131
There they are. There they are.

986
01:21:31,888 --> 01:21:34,599
I was in no way prepared for that.

987
01:21:35,475 --> 01:21:38,478
It's all right. Don't worry.
We're fine. We can handle it.

988
01:21:38,645 --> 01:21:40,981
We can take it.
They want to play rough.

989
01:21:41,147 --> 01:21:45,652
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!
Ghostbusters!

990
01:21:47,362 --> 01:21:48,947
- Wanna play rough?
- Yeah.

991
01:21:49,114 --> 01:21:50,865
Let's do it.

992
01:22:15,890 --> 01:22:17,934
Where are we?

993
01:22:18,101 --> 01:22:22,188
It looks like we're
in the teens somewhere.

994
01:22:22,397 --> 01:22:26,651
Well, when we get to 20, tell me.
I'm gonna throw up.

995
01:22:58,224 --> 01:23:02,854
- Twenty-two. Is this it?
- Yep.

996
01:23:11,738 --> 01:23:14,407
Art deco. Very nice.

997
01:23:14,574 --> 01:23:17,452
- Where is it?
- It's at the end of the hall.

998
01:23:57,909 --> 01:24:00,537
Hey, where do these stairs go?

999
01:24:03,081 --> 01:24:04,749
They go up.

1000
01:24:09,462 --> 01:24:12,048
Okay, go ahead. Come on.
Go ahead.

1001
01:24:13,133 --> 01:24:15,135
Watch it. Go ahead.

1002
01:24:54,424 --> 01:24:55,800
Dana.

1003
01:25:10,148 --> 01:25:14,152
Okay, so she's a dog.

1004
01:25:53,608 --> 01:25:55,318
It's a girl.

1005
01:26:00,698 --> 01:26:03,076
- It's Gozer.
- I thought Gozer was a man.

1006
01:26:03,243 --> 01:26:07,080
- It's whatever it wants to be.
- Whatever it is, it's gotta get by us.

1007
01:26:07,247 --> 01:26:08,748
Right.

1008
01:26:09,415 --> 01:26:11,417
Go get her, Ray!

1009
01:26:23,763 --> 01:26:25,932
Gozer the Gozerian?

1010
01:26:28,268 --> 01:26:33,356
Good evening. As a duly designated
representative of the city...

1011
01:26:33,523 --> 01:26:35,233
...county and state of New York...

1012
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:37,902
...I order you to cease
all supernatural activity...

1013
01:26:38,069 --> 01:26:39,946
...and return to your place of origin...

1014
01:26:40,154 --> 01:26:42,949
...or to the nearest convenient
parallel dimension.

1015
01:26:43,157 --> 01:26:45,785
That ought to do it.
Thanks very much, Ray.

1016
01:26:45,952 --> 01:26:48,538
Are you a god?

1017
01:26:55,044 --> 01:27:00,466
- No.
- Then die!

1018
01:27:24,324 --> 01:27:30,455
Ray, when someone asks you
if you're a god, you say, "Yes."

1019
01:27:31,122 --> 01:27:35,835
All right. This chick is toast.

1020
01:27:48,139 --> 01:27:50,642
- Got your stick?
- Holding it.

1021
01:27:52,685 --> 01:27:54,145
Heat them up!

1022
01:27:54,604 --> 01:27:56,022
Smoking!

1023
01:27:56,689 --> 01:27:59,525
- Make them hard.
- Ready!

1024
01:27:59,692 --> 01:28:02,946
Let's show this prehistoric bitch
how we do things downtown.

1025
01:28:05,531 --> 01:28:06,991
Throw it!

1026
01:28:15,875 --> 01:28:19,712
- Nimble little minx, isn't she?
- We better go full stream.

1027
01:28:19,879 --> 01:28:22,173
Aim for the flattop.

1028
01:28:31,975 --> 01:28:33,726
Wasn't so hard.

1029
01:28:40,066 --> 01:28:41,567
We neutronized it.

1030
01:28:41,734 --> 01:28:44,362
You know what that means?
A complete particle reversal.

1031
01:28:44,529 --> 01:28:47,365
And we had the tools.
We had the talent.

1032
01:28:47,532 --> 01:28:49,826
It's Miller time.

1033
01:28:49,993 --> 01:28:54,664
- Ray, this looks extraordinarily bad.
- Oh, no.

1034
01:28:54,831 --> 01:28:56,332
What?

1035
01:29:05,883 --> 01:29:07,593
Look out!

1036
01:29:30,324 --> 01:29:36,289
Sub-creatures. Gozer the Gozerian,
Gozer the Destructor...

1037
01:29:36,456 --> 01:29:41,085
...Volguus Zildrohar
the Traveler has come.

1038
01:29:41,252 --> 01:29:44,130
Choose and perish.

1039
01:29:44,338 --> 01:29:47,800
What do you mean, "choose"?
We don't understand.

1040
01:29:47,967 --> 01:29:53,639
Choose. Choose the form
of the Destructor.

1041
01:29:53,848 --> 01:29:58,436
Oh, I get it. I get it. Oh, very cute.

1042
01:29:58,978 --> 01:30:01,814
Whatever we think of.
If we think of J. Edgar Hoover...

1043
01:30:01,981 --> 01:30:05,276
...J. Edgar Hoover will appear and
destroy us, so empty your heads.

1044
01:30:05,443 --> 01:30:08,321
Don't think of anything.
We've only got one shot at this.

1045
01:30:08,488 --> 01:30:12,325
The choice is made.

1046
01:30:12,492 --> 01:30:14,744
The Traveler has come.

1047
01:30:14,911 --> 01:30:16,996
Nobody choosed anything.

1048
01:30:17,163 --> 01:30:18,623
- Did you choose anything?
- No.

1049
01:30:18,790 --> 01:30:20,124
- Did you?
- My mind is blank.

1050
01:30:20,291 --> 01:30:22,668
I didn't choose anything!

1051
01:30:32,303 --> 01:30:34,180
I couldn't help it.

1052
01:30:35,181 --> 01:30:37,350
It just popped in there.

1053
01:30:38,017 --> 01:30:41,604
What? What just popped in there?

1054
01:30:41,771 --> 01:30:44,649
- I tried to think...
- Look!

1055
01:30:45,608 --> 01:30:48,152
- No! It can't be.
- What is it?

1056
01:30:48,319 --> 01:30:50,029
- It can't be.
- What did you do, Ray?

1057
01:30:50,196 --> 01:30:52,323
Oh, shit.

1058
01:31:03,209 --> 01:31:05,294
It's the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.

1059
01:31:36,909 --> 01:31:38,911
There's something
you don't see every day.

1060
01:31:39,078 --> 01:31:40,913
I tried to think of a harmless thing.

1061
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:43,082
Something I loved
from my childhood.

1062
01:31:43,249 --> 01:31:48,087
Something that could never, ever
possibly destroy us. Mr. Stay Puft.

1063
01:31:48,254 --> 01:31:50,256
Nice thinking, Ray.

1064
01:31:51,257 --> 01:31:53,259
We used to roast
Stay Puft marshmallows...

1065
01:31:53,426 --> 01:31:55,261
...by the fire at Camp Waconda.

1066
01:31:57,054 --> 01:32:01,267
Ray, has gone bye-bye, Egon.
What have you got left?

1067
01:32:01,601 --> 01:32:06,772
Sorry, Venkman. I'm terrified beyond
the capacity for rational thought.

1068
01:32:16,782 --> 01:32:19,785
- Oh, no.
- Mother pus bucket.

1069
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:27,084
Nobody steps on a church
in my town.

1070
01:32:27,251 --> 01:32:30,213
One, two, three, roast him.

1071
01:32:50,024 --> 01:32:51,651
Funny, us going out like this.

1072
01:32:51,817 --> 01:32:54,153
Killed by a 100-foot
marshmallow man.

1073
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:57,490
We've been going about this wrong.
This Mr. Stay Puft is a sailor.

1074
01:32:57,657 --> 01:33:01,494
He's in New York. We get this
guy laid, we won't have any trouble.

1075
01:33:05,414 --> 01:33:08,459
I have a radical idea.
The door swings both ways.

1076
01:33:08,626 --> 01:33:11,128
We could reverse the particle flow
through the gate.

1077
01:33:11,295 --> 01:33:13,130
How?

1078
01:33:13,297 --> 01:33:15,508
- We'll cross the streams.
- Excuse me, Egon.

1079
01:33:15,675 --> 01:33:17,468
You said crossing the streams
was bad.

1080
01:33:17,635 --> 01:33:20,763
- Cross the streams.
- You're gonna endanger us.

1081
01:33:20,930 --> 01:33:22,682
You're gonna endanger our client...

1082
01:33:22,848 --> 01:33:25,851
...the nice lady who paid us in
advance before she became a dog.

1083
01:33:26,060 --> 01:33:30,147
Not necessarily. There's definitely
a very slim chance we'll survive.

1084
01:33:35,861 --> 01:33:39,615
I love this plan. I'm excited
to be a part of it. Let's do it.

1085
01:33:39,782 --> 01:33:43,494
This job is definitely not
worth 11,500 a year.

1086
01:33:47,123 --> 01:33:48,624
Hurry.

1087
01:33:50,584 --> 01:33:52,962
See you on the other side, Ray.

1088
01:33:55,214 --> 01:33:57,883
Nice working with you, Dr. Venkman.

1089
01:34:06,225 --> 01:34:07,893
Let's turn them on, Spengler!

1090
01:34:11,147 --> 01:34:13,399
Now, Spengler!

1091
01:34:18,696 --> 01:34:20,573
Get out of here!

1092
01:35:13,751 --> 01:35:15,252
Winston.

1093
01:35:16,212 --> 01:35:17,963
Are you all right?

1094
01:35:23,177 --> 01:35:24,637
Venkman?

1095
01:35:24,804 --> 01:35:26,138
Spengler!

1096
01:35:27,139 --> 01:35:28,641
Venkman!

1097
01:35:31,977 --> 01:35:33,479
Spengler.

1098
01:35:34,897 --> 01:35:37,733
Oh, Spengler. Oh, are you okay?

1099
01:35:37,900 --> 01:35:39,985
I feel like the floor of a taxicab.

1100
01:35:40,194 --> 01:35:42,321
- Venky!
- Yeah, where are you?

1101
01:35:42,488 --> 01:35:44,824
Oh, thank God.

1102
01:35:45,950 --> 01:35:47,660
- You okay?
- I'm all right.

1103
01:35:47,827 --> 01:35:49,286
- You all right?
- I'm all right.

1104
01:35:49,453 --> 01:35:51,747
- You all right?
- Yeah. You okay?

1105
01:35:51,914 --> 01:35:53,416
Fine.

1106
01:36:01,715 --> 01:36:04,677
It smells like barbecued dog hair.

1107
01:36:05,177 --> 01:36:07,138
Oh, Venkman.

1108
01:36:07,304 --> 01:36:09,515
Oh, Venkman, I'm sorry.

1109
01:36:10,224 --> 01:36:13,144
I'm sorry. I just... I just forgot.

1110
01:36:27,533 --> 01:36:29,118
Look!

1111
01:36:56,270 --> 01:36:59,064
Somebody turn on the lights!

1112
01:36:59,231 --> 01:37:02,359
- Help! Somebody!
- Go check on that little guy.

1113
01:37:07,865 --> 01:37:09,783
What happened?

1114
01:37:19,001 --> 01:37:20,753
Where am I?

1115
01:37:22,588 --> 01:37:25,716
Oh, hi.

1116
01:37:26,091 --> 01:37:27,927
You'll be all right.

1117
01:37:28,427 --> 01:37:31,931
Boy, the superintendent's
gonna be pissed.

1118
01:37:33,432 --> 01:37:35,351
Are you okay?

1119
01:37:36,018 --> 01:37:37,895
Who are you guys?

1120
01:37:38,062 --> 01:37:40,105
We're the Ghostbusters.

1121
01:37:42,942 --> 01:37:44,360
Who does your taxes?

1122
01:37:45,110 --> 01:37:48,239
You know, Mr. Tully,
you are a most fortunate individual.

1123
01:37:48,405 --> 01:37:50,699
- I know.
- You have been a participant in...

1124
01:37:50,866 --> 01:37:54,453
...the biggest interdimensional cross
rip since the Tunguska blast of 1909.

1125
01:37:54,620 --> 01:37:56,789
- Felt great.
- We'd like to get a sample...

1126
01:37:56,956 --> 01:37:59,833
- ...of your brain tissue.
- Okay.

1127
01:38:02,878 --> 01:38:05,589
I love this town!

1128
01:38:49,425 --> 01:38:51,427
Egon!

1129
01:38:58,392 --> 01:39:00,311
What's going on?

1130
01:39:01,353 --> 01:39:03,689
Does anybody want to interview me?

1131
01:39:03,897 --> 01:39:07,276
I'm an eyewitness. I was up there.

1132
01:39:07,818 --> 01:39:09,987
I want to go with them in the car.
