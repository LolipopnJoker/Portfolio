<i>all kinds of problems

4
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:28,627
<i>Pete Giddings will have
the forecast.</i>

5
00:01:28,629 --> 00:01:30,862
<i>And we'll show you
what would happen to the Bay</i>

6
00:01:30,864 --> 00:01:33,264
<i>if some scientists' predictions
come true.</i>

7
00:01:33,266 --> 00:01:35,069

<i>It's Hands Across America.</i>

13
00:01:48,281 --> 00:01:50,248
<i>A 4,000-mile-long chain</i>

00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:59,891
<i>and across fruited plains,

17
00:01:59,893 --> 00:02:01,692
<i>That's right.</i>

18
00:02:01,694 --> 00:02:05,163
<i>This summer, six million people

19
00:02:05,165 --> 00:02:07,598

<i>how you can be a part

22
00:02:21,981 --> 00:02:23,748
Put some heat on that one.

23
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,184
Yeah, I guess
I missed my chance to go pro.

24
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,287
Oh!

25
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:31,923
Tell you what.

26
00:02:31,925 --> 00:02:33,625
Right now, you could walk away

27
00:02:33,627 --> 00:02:36,026
with a prize
from the second level,

28
00:02:36,028 --> 00:02:39,297
or you could keep going for
a prize from the third level.

29
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:41,166
Okay.
What do you think, Addy?

30
00:02:41,168 --> 00:02:43,969
Should we stop or keep going?

31
00:02:46,006 --> 00:02:49,006
Don't look at me.
It's your birthday.

32
00:02:49,008 --> 00:02:51,008
I want number 11.

33
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,977
- Yeah?
- That one?

34
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:54,679
- Yeah.
- All right.

35
00:02:54,681 --> 00:02:56,317
Uh, yeah, uh, that one.

36
00:02:58,384 --> 00:03:00,186
- Thanks, man.
- Of course.

37
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:05,756
Yeah.

38
00:03:05,758 --> 00:03:08,760
That shirt better not
give her nightmares.

39
00:03:08,762 --> 00:03:11,996
In trouble for winning
my daughter a T-shirt.

40
00:03:11,998 --> 00:03:13,931
That's a new one.

41
00:03:13,933 --> 00:03:16,701
She was terrified
when it came on TV.

42
00:03:16,703 --> 00:03:18,370
You'd know that
if you were around, right?

43
00:03:18,372 --> 00:03:20,704
Who let her watch it?

44
00:03:23,943 --> 00:03:25,744
You know...

45
00:03:25,746 --> 00:03:27,745
you know, they're filming
something by the carousel.

46
00:03:27,747 --> 00:03:29,780
You should see if
they're looking for extras.

47
00:03:29,782 --> 00:03:31,382
Uh... I need another beer.

48
00:03:38,025 --> 00:03:40,225
I can't have a beer now?

49
00:03:40,227 --> 00:03:43,794
Hey. How about the Big Dipper?

50
00:03:43,796 --> 00:03:45,964
Addy, you want to try it?

51
00:03:45,966 --> 00:03:48,198
Russel, you know she's
not big enough to do that.

52
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,300
And I sure as hell
am not doing it, so...

53
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:56,407
Whac-A-Mole!

54
00:03:56,409 --> 00:03:58,410
Yeah, Whac-A-Mole, guy.

55
00:03:58,412 --> 00:04:00,911
- That's what I'm talking about.
- How many tickets?

56
00:04:00,913 --> 00:04:03,982
- Two tickets.
- Two tickets!

57
00:04:03,984 --> 00:04:05,449
Two tickets!

58
00:04:05,451 --> 00:04:07,452
Hey, Addy,
come to the bathroom.

59
00:04:07,454 --> 00:04:09,953
I don't have to go.

60
00:04:14,093 --> 00:04:16,360
Russel?

61
00:04:16,362 --> 00:04:19,430
Russel! Can you watch
your daughter, please?

62
00:04:19,432 --> 00:04:21,168
I'm watching.

63
00:04:23,103 --> 00:04:25,704
Baby, stay close, okay?

64
00:04:37,216 --> 00:04:38,916
- Glen.
- What?

65
00:04:38,918 --> 00:04:41,051
- Stop it.
- I'm not doing anything.

66
00:04:41,053 --> 00:04:42,420
You keep doing scissors.

67
00:04:42,422 --> 00:04:44,022
Ah, I'm just cruising.

68
00:04:44,024 --> 00:04:46,791
Come on.

69
00:04:46,793 --> 00:04:48,358
Um, what?

70
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,161
- This is ridiculous.
- It's too rad.

71
00:04:50,163 --> 00:04:51,829
Two knots. Come on, now.

72
00:04:51,831 --> 00:04:53,163
What?

73
00:04:53,165 --> 00:04:56,134
- This is... this is impossible.
- Oh, my God.

74
00:05:54,961 --> 00:05:57,230
Don't do it. Don't do it.

75
00:06:08,908 --> 00:06:12,142
<i>These, the earth and water,</i>

76
00:06:12,144 --> 00:06:15,980
<i>he divided into places
from which life could spring.</i>

77
00:06:15,982 --> 00:06:18,149
<i>The mountains and the valleys</i>

78
00:06:18,151 --> 00:06:22,252
<i>and the waters
were all where they should be.</i>

79
00:06:24,124 --> 00:06:27,457
<i>Then Sotuknang went to Taiowa
and said,</i>

80
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:30,161
<i>"I want you to see
what I have done.</i>

81
00:06:30,163 --> 00:06:32,029
<i>And I have done well."</i>

82
00:06:32,031 --> 00:06:34,598
<i>And Taiowa looked and said,</i>

83
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,500
<i>"It is very good.</i>

84
00:06:36,502 --> 00:06:39,269
<i>"But you are not done with it.</i>

85
00:06:39,271 --> 00:06:42,373
<i>"Now you must create life
of all kinds</i>

86
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:45,512
<i>and set it in motion
according to my plan."</i>

87
00:06:51,218 --> 00:06:52,983
<i>...and went
into the endless space</i>

88
00:06:52,985 --> 00:06:55,385
<i>and gathered substance
to create his helper,</i>

89
00:06:55,387 --> 00:06:57,454
<i>the Spider Woman.</i>

90
00:06:57,456 --> 00:07:01,091
<i>"Look all about you,
Spider Woman," said Sotuknang.</i>

91
00:07:01,093 --> 00:07:03,360
<i>"Here now is endless space,</i>

92
00:07:03,362 --> 00:07:06,264
<i>"but in the world,
there is no joyful movement.</i>

93
00:07:06,266 --> 00:07:07,598
<i>The world needs..."</i>

94
00:12:13,673 --> 00:12:15,339
We made it!

95
00:12:15,341 --> 00:12:17,307
- Why?! Why?!
- No, Dad!

96
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:19,810
- 'Cause y'all sleep too much.
- All right.

97
00:12:19,812 --> 00:12:22,280
Come on. Let's go.

98
00:12:22,282 --> 00:12:24,549
Careful. Hey, hey, hey!

99
00:12:24,551 --> 00:12:26,349
- Ah, whatever.
- Bags in the house first.

100
00:12:26,351 --> 00:12:27,919
Look, look, look, look, look.

101
00:12:27,921 --> 00:12:29,786
- Ew.
- Come on.

102
00:12:29,788 --> 00:12:31,388
You're too old.

103
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,623
- You know the drill.
- Don't judge me.

104
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,759
Don't judge me.

105
00:12:35,761 --> 00:12:37,695
- Little dude.
- The Wi-Fi's not working.

106
00:12:37,697 --> 00:12:40,464
You don't need the Internet.
You got the Outernet.

107
00:12:40,466 --> 00:12:41,732
Good one.

108
00:12:41,734 --> 00:12:43,434
<i>Okay, okay, okay.</i>

109
00:12:43,436 --> 00:12:44,801
Knock-knock.

110
00:12:44,803 --> 00:12:46,637
- Who's there?
- You.

111
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,772
You who?

112
00:12:47,774 --> 00:12:49,272
Yoo-hoo.

113
00:12:49,274 --> 00:12:50,541
Open up the door.

114
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,611
My God, what's wrong with you?

115
00:12:53,613 --> 00:12:55,646
- Can we get a dog?
- No, we can't.

116
00:12:55,648 --> 00:12:57,214
You should run
while you're here.

117
00:12:57,216 --> 00:12:58,348
Jason, eat something.

118
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,816
- Something.
- What?

119
00:12:59,818 --> 00:13:01,551
- What's with all the attitude?
- For me.

120
00:13:01,553 --> 00:13:02,652
I'm sorry.

121
00:13:02,654 --> 00:13:04,488
Yay, track and field.

122
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,824
Whoa. You don't want
to run anymore?

123
00:13:06,826 --> 00:13:08,526
You love track and field.

124
00:13:08,528 --> 00:13:11,395
- Well, what's the point?
- The Olympics.

125
00:13:11,397 --> 00:13:12,997
I'm not gonna make it
to the Olympics, guys.

126
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:15,432
You could do anything
you set your mind to.

127
00:13:15,434 --> 00:13:16,700
Can I drive
while we're up here?

128
00:13:16,702 --> 00:13:18,236
- No.
- No.

129
00:13:18,238 --> 00:13:19,570
Well, that's what
I set my mind to.

130
00:13:19,572 --> 00:13:21,339
- You know...
- Where you going, Jason?

131
00:13:21,341 --> 00:13:22,672
- Jason?
- Well, Cara and Haley...

132
00:13:22,674 --> 00:13:23,907
Yeah, I'm gonna get something.

133
00:13:23,909 --> 00:13:25,443
You need to come
and finish your food.

134
00:13:25,445 --> 00:13:26,844
Cara and Haley drove
with parent supervision.

135
00:13:26,846 --> 00:13:28,579
Yeah, well,
you don't need to know

136
00:13:28,581 --> 00:13:30,781
how to drive when you're
an Olympic-caliber athlete.

137
00:13:30,783 --> 00:13:32,416
- Oh, my God.
- You run.

138
00:13:32,418 --> 00:13:34,785
- You run on the sand.
- Why?

139
00:13:34,787 --> 00:13:37,287
Because it's harder, okay?

140
00:13:37,289 --> 00:13:38,789
- No traction.
- Mm.

141
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,858
Practice on the beach,
you get on dry land,

142
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,925
you take off.

143
00:13:41,927 --> 00:13:43,526
We're going to the beach?

144
00:13:43,528 --> 00:13:45,463
Yeah. Well, later.

145
00:13:45,465 --> 00:13:47,265
Once we get settled.

146
00:13:47,267 --> 00:13:50,001
- What beach?
- Santa Cruz.

147
00:13:50,003 --> 00:13:52,335
Josh, Kitty and the girls
are gonna be there.

148
00:13:58,677 --> 00:14:00,310
What are you doing?

149
00:14:00,312 --> 00:14:01,579
It's a magic trick.

150
00:14:01,581 --> 00:14:03,546
I left it here last year.

151
00:14:03,548 --> 00:14:04,684
Okay. Let's see it.

152
00:14:11,057 --> 00:14:12,989
This thing's kind of bullshit.

153
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:16,594
Hey. What, are we cursing
at the table now?

154
00:14:16,596 --> 00:14:18,329
When you point a finger
at someone else,

155
00:14:18,331 --> 00:14:19,700
you have three pointing
back at you.

156
00:14:22,835 --> 00:14:25,835
What is that supposed to mean?

157
00:14:25,837 --> 00:14:28,506
It's four fingers
pointing back at you.

158
00:14:28,508 --> 00:14:29,839
What are you talking...?

159
00:14:29,841 --> 00:14:31,574
Look. See?

160
00:14:31,576 --> 00:14:33,743
One's a thumb,
and it's not pointing at you.

161
00:14:33,745 --> 00:14:35,546
<i>So, what is it?</i>

162
00:14:36,783 --> 00:14:39,316
I think she has
post-traumatic stress disorder.

163
00:14:39,318 --> 00:14:41,685
She wasn't in 'Nam.

164
00:14:41,687 --> 00:14:44,789
Okay? She got lost.
For 15 minutes. That's...

165
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,656
That can be very scary.

166
00:14:46,658 --> 00:14:48,492
No, you don't know
what happened to her.

167
00:14:48,494 --> 00:14:49,926
Anything could've
happened to her.

168
00:14:49,928 --> 00:14:53,730
Okay, so... so how-how do we
get her to talk?

169
00:14:53,732 --> 00:14:55,999
Look, I think
we need to encourage her

170
00:14:56,001 --> 00:14:58,868
to draw, to write, to dance.

171
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,939
Anything to help her
tell us her story.

172
00:15:04,043 --> 00:15:06,312
I just want
my little girl back.

173
00:15:08,081 --> 00:15:09,850
It's gonna be okay.

174
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,462
- Um...
- I'm sorry.

175
00:15:24,464 --> 00:15:27,765
- Is...
- I'm... I'm gonna...

176
00:15:27,767 --> 00:15:29,836
I need to have a smoke.

177
00:16:04,604 --> 00:16:07,637
I don't get
why we have a summer home

178
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:09,507
by the beach

179
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:10,807
and don't go to the beach.

180
00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:12,075
What about the beach
right here?

181
00:16:12,077 --> 00:16:13,978
- What beach?
- There's a beach right there.

182
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,546
That is not a beach.

183
00:16:15,548 --> 00:16:17,147
That is a bay.
That is a shore.

184
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:19,083
I'm talking about a real beach,

185
00:16:19,085 --> 00:16:21,518
with people and sand,
amusement park.

186
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,720
There's, like...
It's crowded there.

187
00:16:23,722 --> 00:16:25,723
- Oh, come...
- And, like, there's weirdos

188
00:16:25,725 --> 00:16:29,026
at that beach and...
I-I'm not going to that beach.

189
00:16:29,028 --> 00:16:31,462
- We're not going.
- Okay.

190
00:16:31,464 --> 00:16:33,464
I guess I'll just cancel, then.

191
00:16:33,466 --> 00:16:35,098
Okay.

192
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,700
It just sucks, is all.

193
00:16:37,702 --> 00:16:39,804
I mean...

194
00:16:39,806 --> 00:16:42,506
I know Jason really was
looking forward to it.

195
00:16:42,508 --> 00:16:44,041
This is the first summer

196
00:16:44,043 --> 00:16:46,009
we've been back here
since Grandma died.

197
00:16:46,011 --> 00:16:48,945
I know it's been
pretty hard on him.

198
00:16:53,152 --> 00:16:55,084
We leave before dark.

199
00:16:55,086 --> 00:16:56,554
Yeah.

200
00:16:56,556 --> 00:16:57,854
Yes. Yes.

201
00:16:57,856 --> 00:16:59,656
It's gonna be great.

202
00:16:59,658 --> 00:17:01,658
- And you're gonna enjoy it.
- Mm-hmm.

203
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,892
Mm-hmm.

204
00:17:02,894 --> 00:17:04,127
Mm-hmm.

205
00:17:04,129 --> 00:17:05,996
Are you really not
gonna kiss me?

206
00:17:05,998 --> 00:17:07,030
Mm-mm.

207
00:17:07,032 --> 00:17:10,200
You're not gonna kiss me?

208
00:17:10,202 --> 00:17:13,470
Hmm? Mm...

209
00:17:18,009 --> 00:17:20,076
Where's your brother?

210
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:21,879
Your brother... where is he?

211
00:17:21,881 --> 00:17:23,881
I don't know.

212
00:17:23,883 --> 00:17:25,519
Really?

213
00:17:28,086 --> 00:17:29,756
Jason?

214
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,866
Jason?

215
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:04,748
Baby, that's why
you can't play in here.

216
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,884
- Didn't this happen last year?
- Zora, please.

217
00:19:18,163 --> 00:19:21,364
Yeah!

218
00:19:21,366 --> 00:19:24,334
That's right.
What do you think?!

219
00:19:24,336 --> 00:19:27,770
Daddy is home, baby!

220
00:19:29,342 --> 00:19:31,342
Craw Daddy!

221
00:19:33,378 --> 00:19:36,145
- He's kidding, right?
- He is not kidding.

222
00:19:36,147 --> 00:19:38,649
Got a cassette player
and everything.

223
00:19:38,651 --> 00:19:40,617
Leather seats!

224
00:19:40,619 --> 00:19:42,353
Glove compartment!

225
00:19:42,355 --> 00:19:45,889
- Wow.
- That's right.

226
00:19:45,891 --> 00:19:48,792
It's even got
one of these, baby!

227
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:55,301
Oh, I got it, I got it.
Guy taught me how to do this.

228
00:19:59,805 --> 00:20:02,909
It veers a little to the left,
so you got to hold on to it.

229
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:09,013
Least I got it really cheap.

230
00:20:09,015 --> 00:20:11,347
- Will we all fit, though?
- You know what?

231
00:20:11,349 --> 00:20:13,350
Y'all are spoiled.

232
00:20:19,424 --> 00:20:21,961
Spoiled.

233
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:34,337
Did you know that there's
fluoride in the water

234
00:20:34,339 --> 00:20:36,643
that the government uses
to control our minds?

235
00:20:41,413 --> 00:20:44,217
I forgot. Nobody cares about
the end of the world.

236
00:20:49,387 --> 00:20:51,822
Maybe you could just tell us
what's supposed to happen,

237
00:20:51,824 --> 00:20:53,757
and then we can picture it.

238
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:56,026
Maybe you can
kiss my anus, Zora.

239
00:20:56,028 --> 00:20:58,828
- Ew!
- Whoa, whoa! - What?

240
00:20:58,830 --> 00:20:59,962
"Anus" isn't a cuss word.

241
00:20:59,964 --> 00:21:01,398
Why are we even talking
about anuses?

242
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,433
- Why would you say that?
- I would have

243
00:21:03,435 --> 00:21:06,870
actually preferred you use
a curse word in this case.

244
00:21:06,872 --> 00:21:09,038
Mom, I can see you laughing.

245
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,842
- I am not laughing.
- Where'd you even learn that?

246
00:21:11,844 --> 00:21:14,077
Okay, we don't always
have to be talking.

- It's about drugs.
- It's not about drugs.

256
00:21:43,275 --> 00:21:45,109
It's a dope song.
Don't do drugs.

257
00:21:47,179 --> 00:21:49,278
- Jason, come on.
- Hmm?

258
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,981
Get in rhythm.

259
00:21:54,053 --> 00:21:55,853
There you go. There you go.

260
00:22:10,001 --> 00:22:12,268
Oh, yeah.

261
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:16,073
Welcome to Santa Cruz.

262
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:20,110
Huh?

263
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:30,187
Santa Cruz!

264
00:22:30,189 --> 00:22:32,122
Santa Cruz!

265
00:22:32,124 --> 00:22:34,958
- Santa Cruz!
- Okay, we get it!

266
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,428
Santa Cruz! Santa Cruz!

267
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,296
Santa Cruz!

268
00:22:40,298 --> 00:22:41,931
- She did...
- Five minutes.

269
00:22:41,933 --> 00:22:43,299
- You can't even talk.
- Look, I don't want to

270
00:22:43,301 --> 00:22:45,067
- talk about who can't talk.
- Russ...

271
00:22:45,069 --> 00:22:46,503
- What's gonna happen?
- If something happened to her...

272
00:22:46,505 --> 00:22:48,538
What's gonna happen,
okay? She left!

273
00:22:53,345 --> 00:22:55,478
Oh, my God.

274
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,215
- Don't look. Don't look.
- Is he dead?

275
00:22:58,217 --> 00:23:00,083
You got to be kidding me.

276
00:23:48,334 --> 00:23:51,133
- Hey.
- Hey! What's up? - Hey.

277
00:23:51,135 --> 00:23:53,437
Thought you guys said 2:30.
Where's the efficiency, man?

278
00:23:53,439 --> 00:23:56,073
- Us Wilsons, you know, we take our time.
- Hey.

279
00:23:56,075 --> 00:23:58,174
- Hey. Look at you.
- Oh, my God, look at you.

280
00:23:58,176 --> 00:23:59,642
- Yes.
- Welcome to paradise.

281
00:23:59,644 --> 00:24:01,478
- Of course, man. - Hey.
- You look so pretty!

282
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,513
- Hi. How are you?
- Thank you.

283
00:24:02,515 --> 00:24:03,613
Oh, the girls are gonna be
so happy to see you.

284
00:24:03,615 --> 00:24:05,915
Uh, what do you want?
I can get some beer for you.

285
00:24:05,917 --> 00:24:07,084
- Becca! Lindsey! Look who's here!
- No.

286
00:24:07,086 --> 00:24:08,317
- No?
- The answer is no.

287
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:09,620
- Please.
- He's old enough.

288
00:24:09,622 --> 00:24:11,153
- In a couple more years.
- Don't hawk her.

289
00:24:11,155 --> 00:24:13,523
- All right, all right.
- Hi.

290
00:24:13,525 --> 00:24:15,292
- No shit. You got the boat?
- Yep, I got the boat.

291
00:24:15,294 --> 00:24:16,459
- Good for you, dude.
- Boom.

292
00:24:16,461 --> 00:24:18,061
That's fucking awesome.
What'd you get?

293
00:24:18,063 --> 00:24:20,029
- A dinghy? You get, like...
- Oh, shut up.

294
00:24:20,031 --> 00:24:21,965
You got to make sure
you have the essentials.

295
00:24:21,967 --> 00:24:23,600
- You got the life preservers?
- Got that.

296
00:24:23,602 --> 00:24:25,334
- You got a fire extinguisher?
- Got that.

297
00:24:25,336 --> 00:24:28,205
Do you have a flare gun?

298
00:24:28,207 --> 00:24:31,208
I knew you'd fucking forget the flare gun.

299
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:33,309
We got to get out there
and do a double excursion.

300
00:24:33,311 --> 00:24:35,679
We're right across the bay
from you guys, for fuck's sake.

301
00:24:35,681 --> 00:24:37,381
Sure you don't want
anything to drink?

302
00:24:37,383 --> 00:24:39,949
- No, I'm good. Thanks.
- This rosé is delicious.

303
00:24:39,951 --> 00:24:43,056
Mm-hmm. I'm sure, yeah.

304
00:24:44,589 --> 00:24:46,623
Did you guys have
a good summer so far?

305
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:48,458
Yeah, it's been great.

306
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:51,228
No, a little bit small,
but a classic design, you know?

307
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,395
You good?

308
00:24:52,397 --> 00:24:54,463
Yeah.

309
00:24:54,465 --> 00:24:55,901
What?

310
00:24:57,001 --> 00:24:59,268
I have a hard time just...

311
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:01,337
you know, talking.

312
00:25:01,339 --> 00:25:03,105
Oh, I get that.

313
00:25:03,107 --> 00:25:05,441
Yeah, no, I totally get that.

314
00:25:05,443 --> 00:25:07,544
You guys, uh, want something?

315
00:25:07,546 --> 00:25:09,278
Got a full bar here.

316
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,547
No. All good. Water.

317
00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:13,150
You want thirds, huh?

318
00:25:13,152 --> 00:25:15,651
- Thank you.
- Okay.

319
00:25:15,653 --> 00:25:18,020
I'm gonna get my wife
her medicine.

320
00:25:18,022 --> 00:25:19,488
That's beautiful, isn't it?

321
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:20,724
Here you go.

322
00:25:20,726 --> 00:25:22,159
- Just... - Mm, yeah.
- Ah, ah.

323
00:25:22,161 --> 00:25:24,260
What do we say?

324
00:25:24,262 --> 00:25:25,461
I hate you?

325
00:25:25,463 --> 00:25:26,697
- That works.
- Yeah?

326
00:25:26,699 --> 00:25:29,333
- Yeah.
- Good.

327
00:25:29,335 --> 00:25:31,468
Never stops.

328
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,703
I think about
murdering him sometimes.

329
00:25:33,705 --> 00:25:36,305
- So nothing's changed, huh?
- Nope.

330
00:25:36,307 --> 00:25:40,379
Oh, actually,
a little something has changed.

331
00:25:42,114 --> 00:25:44,347
Oh, my God.

332
00:25:44,349 --> 00:25:46,182
Did you get something done?

333
00:25:46,184 --> 00:25:48,084
Just, like, an itsy-bitsy,
little... a little thing.

334
00:25:48,086 --> 00:25:50,386
- Oh, fuck off.
- Yeah.

335
00:25:50,388 --> 00:25:52,189
Well, you look just like
you did last year.

336
00:25:52,191 --> 00:25:53,457
Aw, thank you.

337
00:25:53,459 --> 00:25:55,092
I mean, that's the idea,
you know.

338
00:25:55,094 --> 00:25:57,526
- Just, like, a little bit can go a long way.
- Mm.

339
00:25:57,528 --> 00:26:00,630
Not that you need
anything, whore.

340
00:26:11,509 --> 00:26:13,509
- Oh, man.
- Oops.

341
00:26:13,511 --> 00:26:15,411
What was it?

342
00:26:15,413 --> 00:26:18,547
Just a stupid tunnel.
That's all.

343
00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:21,287
Ugh.
Beach toys are such baby shit.

344
00:26:29,028 --> 00:26:31,394
Your brother's so weird.

345
00:26:31,396 --> 00:26:33,532
He just has
a hard time focusing.

346
00:26:35,467 --> 00:26:38,035
Are you going in the water?

347
00:26:38,037 --> 00:26:40,202
- No.
- Why not?

348
00:26:40,204 --> 00:26:41,604
Yeah, why not?

349
00:26:41,606 --> 00:26:43,774
- Hey, where are you going?
- To the bathroom.

350
00:26:43,776 --> 00:26:46,142
Why don't you pee in the ocean?

351
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:48,045
Jinx. Double jinx.

352
00:26:48,047 --> 00:26:49,712
Triple jinx. Blackout.

353
00:26:49,714 --> 00:26:52,282
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

354
00:26:52,284 --> 00:26:54,354
Do you ever wish
you kept dancing?

355
00:26:56,154 --> 00:26:58,154
Sometimes, yeah.

356
00:26:58,156 --> 00:27:00,657
'Cause you were, like,
you were really good, right?

357
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:02,459
Yeah, well...

358
00:27:02,461 --> 00:27:04,193
I peaked at 14.

359
00:27:04,195 --> 00:27:05,728
Oh, I mean, didn't we all?

360
00:27:17,643 --> 00:27:19,609
I think I could have been
a movie star

361
00:27:19,611 --> 00:27:23,313
if the girls hadn't been born
at exactly the wrong time.

362
00:27:23,315 --> 00:27:25,782
I went to Stella Adler,

363
00:27:25,784 --> 00:27:29,286
and I booked two commercials
before I met Josh.

364
00:27:29,288 --> 00:27:30,487
It's just, I stopped auditioning

365
00:27:30,489 --> 00:27:31,555
when I got pregnant.

366
00:27:31,557 --> 00:27:32,623
Then the move to San Francisco

367
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:35,292
was a career killer, and...

368
00:27:35,294 --> 00:27:37,360
I was supposed to keep flying
back to L.A.

369
00:27:39,832 --> 00:27:41,198
It's just...

370
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,434
Jesus. Watch it.

371
00:27:44,336 --> 00:27:47,470
Ugh. That's crazy.

372
00:27:47,472 --> 00:27:51,243
Been having so many
crazy coincidences lately.

373
00:28:10,729 --> 00:28:12,664
Yeah, that's what he said.

374
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,554
- Anyways, we should go back to our place.
- Sure.

375
00:28:37,556 --> 00:28:39,421
- I think it's vodka o'clock.
- Oh, yeah. Definitely.

376
00:28:39,423 --> 00:28:41,190
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay, good. Let's pack up.

377
00:28:41,192 --> 00:28:42,659
Okay.

378
00:28:45,364 --> 00:28:46,662
Where's Jason?

379
00:28:46,664 --> 00:28:47,831
Mm...

380
00:28:47,833 --> 00:28:50,566
Jason. Where's Jason?

381
00:28:50,568 --> 00:28:52,369
Gabe.

382
00:28:52,371 --> 00:28:54,403
Where's Jason?

383
00:28:54,405 --> 00:28:56,273
Jason?

384
00:28:57,875 --> 00:28:59,345
Jason?

385
00:29:00,846 --> 00:29:03,348
- Jason?
- Jason!

386
00:29:04,449 --> 00:29:06,586
- Jason?
- Jason!

387
00:29:10,556 --> 00:29:12,455
- Where were you?
- I was in the bath...

388
00:29:12,457 --> 00:29:14,324
No! You don't do that.

389
00:29:14,326 --> 00:29:15,926
You don't run off
without telling me.

390
00:29:15,928 --> 00:29:17,693
- Ow.
- I'm sorry.

391
00:29:17,695 --> 00:29:19,461
Okay, okay, okay,
okay, we're good.

392
00:29:19,463 --> 00:29:22,268
- We're good. All right.
- You don't do that to me.

393
00:29:24,236 --> 00:29:26,268
- Understand?
- Sorry.

394
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:27,671
I'm gonna get ready to go.

395
00:29:27,673 --> 00:29:29,305
- Okay?
- I think we're gonna head out.

396
00:29:29,307 --> 00:29:30,673
- Yeah.
- Okay?

397
00:29:30,675 --> 00:29:32,741
- No worries.
- Yeah, we're...

398
00:29:32,743 --> 00:29:35,644
<i>The Houston
Astros were essentially short</i>

399
00:29:35,646 --> 00:29:38,381
<i>one everyday player
heading into the season.</i>

400
00:29:38,383 --> 00:29:39,716
<i>No incumbent...</i>

401
00:29:39,718 --> 00:29:41,785
You saw their new car, right?

402
00:29:41,787 --> 00:29:43,519
He had to do it.

403
00:29:43,521 --> 00:29:46,256
He just had to get that thing
to fuck with me, too.

404
00:29:46,258 --> 00:29:47,724
I guess mission accomplished.

405
00:29:47,726 --> 00:29:50,259
Don't run inside.

406
00:29:56,335 --> 00:29:58,969
Way to freak Mom out.

407
00:29:58,971 --> 00:30:00,536
<i>And here's something you don't</i>

408
00:30:00,538 --> 00:30:02,538
<i>see every day:
extra innings in Minnesota.</i>

409
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,806
I'm gonna go say good night.

410
00:30:03,808 --> 00:30:06,742
<i>11-11,
tied in the seventh inning.</i>

411
00:30:06,744 --> 00:30:09,645
<i>Yeah, you see, Hollister, known
for his late-inning fastball,</i>

412
00:30:09,647 --> 00:30:11,314
<i>comes in at a cool...</i>

413
00:30:11,316 --> 00:30:13,315
You good?

414
00:30:13,317 --> 00:30:17,353
I'm just gonna watch
the Giants highlights, okay?

415
00:30:17,355 --> 00:30:21,391
I'll see you later
in the magic room.

416
00:30:21,393 --> 00:30:22,992
Night-night.

417
00:30:22,994 --> 00:30:25,894
- Good night.
- Phone off.

418
00:30:46,451 --> 00:30:47,920
Mask off.

419
00:30:51,589 --> 00:30:54,024
You thought I was dead?

420
00:30:54,026 --> 00:30:57,326
Um, no. Uh, I just...

421
00:30:57,328 --> 00:31:01,030
I just didn't know
if you were lost or...

422
00:31:01,032 --> 00:31:03,533
taken or...

423
00:31:03,535 --> 00:31:05,834
By terrorists and perverts?

424
00:31:09,775 --> 00:31:14,313
Stick with me,
and I'll keep you safe, okay?

425
00:31:24,623 --> 00:31:26,292
Look.

426
00:31:30,561 --> 00:31:32,365
11:11.

427
00:31:36,401 --> 00:31:37,836
Bedtime.

428
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:07,533
Who's this?

429
00:32:12,671 --> 00:32:14,671
<i>You know, I was thinking about</i>

430
00:32:14,673 --> 00:32:17,606
getting some fishing gear
tomorrow.

431
00:32:17,608 --> 00:32:20,776
Four rods, we can all
go fish off the dock.

432
00:32:20,778 --> 00:32:23,546
You know?

433
00:32:23,548 --> 00:32:25,750
Of course,
there's the boat, too.

434
00:32:29,755 --> 00:32:33,155
I'm just saying, if we could
get out there in open water...

435
00:32:33,157 --> 00:32:36,494
I'm not trying to force anyone.

436
00:32:57,648 --> 00:32:59,451
Hey.

437
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,420
Gabe, I want to go.

438
00:33:03,422 --> 00:33:05,555
Where you trying to go?

439
00:33:05,557 --> 00:33:07,657
I can't be here. I...

440
00:33:07,659 --> 00:33:10,826
It's too much.

441
00:33:10,828 --> 00:33:12,528
You serious?

442
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:14,930
Being here, it, um...

443
00:33:14,932 --> 00:33:17,467
Hmm.

444
00:33:17,469 --> 00:33:19,803
It feels like...

445
00:33:19,805 --> 00:33:21,440
there's this, um...

446
00:33:23,508 --> 00:33:27,610
...black cloud
just hanging over me,

447
00:33:27,612 --> 00:33:30,212
and, uh...

448
00:33:30,214 --> 00:33:33,682
I don't feel like myself.

449
00:33:33,684 --> 00:33:36,054
I think you look like yourself.

450
00:33:43,228 --> 00:33:45,431
Okay. Yeah.

451
00:34:01,011 --> 00:34:03,813
When I was a kid,

452
00:34:03,815 --> 00:34:06,852
I went to that boardwalk
with my parents.

453
00:34:08,619 --> 00:34:10,586
<i>I wandered off.</i>

454
00:34:10,588 --> 00:34:13,088
<i>I don't know why. I just did.</i>

455
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:15,661
<i>I ended up
in that hall of mirrors.</i>

456
00:34:17,628 --> 00:34:20,132
<i>There was another girl
in there.</i>

457
00:34:22,934 --> 00:34:25,735
<i>She looked like me.</i>

458
00:34:25,737 --> 00:34:28,905
<i>Exactly like me.</i>

459
00:34:28,907 --> 00:34:30,807
But you were in
the hall of mirrors...

460
00:34:30,809 --> 00:34:33,008
She wasn't a reflection.

461
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:35,079
She was real.

462
00:34:37,548 --> 00:34:40,148
She was real.

463
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,684
She...

464
00:34:48,193 --> 00:34:51,997
I ran as fast as I could.

465
00:34:56,902 --> 00:34:59,070
My whole life, I've...

466
00:35:02,706 --> 00:35:07,045
I've felt like
she's still coming for me.

467
00:35:08,146 --> 00:35:09,945
Okay, well, whatever happened,

468
00:35:09,947 --> 00:35:12,817
happened a-a long time ago,
right?

469
00:35:14,952 --> 00:35:18,054
You know how sometimes
things line up?

470
00:35:18,056 --> 00:35:20,822
- Yeah.
- You know, like coincidences.

471
00:35:20,824 --> 00:35:22,758
Since we've been here,

472
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,864
they've been happening
more and more.

473
00:35:27,798 --> 00:35:31,700
I think...
I feel like it means,

474
00:35:31,702 --> 00:35:33,938
like, she's getting closer.

475
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:38,043
Who? The mirror girl?

476
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:42,644
You don't believe me.

477
00:35:42,646 --> 00:35:44,012
I-I... I-I do.

478
00:35:44,014 --> 00:35:45,615
I do.

479
00:35:45,617 --> 00:35:48,784
I'm-I'm processing. Okay?

480
00:35:48,786 --> 00:35:52,021
I just...

481
00:35:52,023 --> 00:35:57,025
can't believe you kept
all this inside for so long.

482
00:35:57,027 --> 00:35:58,595
Come on.

483
00:35:58,597 --> 00:36:00,662
You know I'm here, right?

484
00:36:00,664 --> 00:36:02,599
I'm pretty sure
I could kick your ass,

485
00:36:02,601 --> 00:36:05,767
so if she looks like you,
then...

486
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:11,007
Okay. Bad joke.

487
00:36:11,009 --> 00:36:12,641
All right.

488
00:36:12,643 --> 00:36:14,744
I'm sorry. My bad.

489
00:36:14,746 --> 00:36:16,746
I'm just trying
to lighten the mood.

490
00:36:18,016 --> 00:36:20,016
Oh, shit.

491
00:36:20,018 --> 00:36:22,651
We lost power.
Perfect timing.

492
00:36:22,653 --> 00:36:25,287
See, this is why Josh has
a backup generator.

493
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:28,191
God! Hell!

494
00:36:28,193 --> 00:36:29,992
Jesus!

495
00:36:29,994 --> 00:36:32,028
Okay, we lost power.
Go back to bed.

496
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:34,697
There's a family
in our driveway.

497
00:36:34,699 --> 00:36:38,967
What? There is not a family
in our driveway.

498
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:45,407
Huh. Who is that?

499
00:36:45,409 --> 00:36:47,075
Uh-uh.

500
00:36:47,077 --> 00:36:49,012
Oh, it is a family.

501
00:36:49,014 --> 00:36:50,749
What, y'all scared of a family?

502
00:36:51,849 --> 00:36:53,715
A bogeyman's family.

503
00:36:53,717 --> 00:36:55,985
Okay, all right.
Enough... enough of that.

504
00:36:55,987 --> 00:36:57,220
No. Uh-uh.

505
00:36:57,222 --> 00:36:59,889
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Uh-uh.

506
00:36:59,891 --> 00:37:01,257
What?

507
00:37:01,259 --> 00:37:02,724
Zora, give me your phone.

508
00:37:02,726 --> 00:37:03,925
- I'm not on it.
- Zora!

509
00:37:03,927 --> 00:37:05,662
Sorry.

510
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:07,063
Is there someone outside?

511
00:37:07,065 --> 00:37:10,066
It's just a family
standing outside.

512
00:37:10,068 --> 00:37:13,135
It's probably the neighbors.

513
00:37:13,137 --> 00:37:13,970
You're kidding me, right?

514
00:37:13,972 --> 00:37:15,204
- Hello.
- I'm scared.

515
00:37:15,206 --> 00:37:16,738
My name is Adelaide Wilson.

516
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,106
Are you seriously
calling 911 right now?

517
00:37:18,108 --> 00:37:19,441
We're at 2311 Seagull Way. Shh!

518
00:37:19,443 --> 00:37:21,077
Everything's good.
We lost power.

519
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:22,711
There are four trespassers
on our property.

520
00:37:22,713 --> 00:37:23,979
- All right, sure, okay.
- Yes.

521
00:37:23,981 --> 00:37:25,380
- You know what?
- What?

522
00:37:25,382 --> 00:37:27,717
- I'm gonna fix this.
- No, we don't.

523
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:29,385
- I'm gonna find out who they are...
- What?

524
00:37:29,387 --> 00:37:31,253
No, they haven't,
but I know they will.

525
00:37:31,255 --> 00:37:33,088
...find out what they want,
and everything's gonna be fine.

526
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:34,856
- Gabe.
- Calm down, okay?

527
00:37:34,858 --> 00:37:36,391
15 minutes?
No, no, no, that's too long.

528
00:37:36,393 --> 00:37:37,927
Oh, boy.

529
00:37:37,929 --> 00:37:39,729
No, you don't,
you don't understand. We...

530
00:37:39,731 --> 00:37:42,097
How about we all just try
to keep calm...

531
00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:43,965
- Gabe. - Dad.
- ...keep our heads,

532
00:37:43,967 --> 00:37:45,400
and everything's gonna
be all right.

533
00:37:45,402 --> 00:37:47,135
No, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

534
00:37:47,137 --> 00:37:49,137
Just one sec... Gabe.

535
00:37:56,347 --> 00:37:58,380
Trying to have a vacation,

536
00:37:58,382 --> 00:38:01,450
and my whole family lost
they goddamn minds.

537
00:38:04,054 --> 00:38:05,954
Hi.

538
00:38:05,956 --> 00:38:07,960
Can I help you?

539
00:38:13,965 --> 00:38:16,331
Okay.

540
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:19,501
If y'all are out here
trying to scare people,

541
00:38:19,503 --> 00:38:22,340
I think you picked
the wrong house for that.

542
00:38:26,244 --> 00:38:28,244
Zora...

543
00:38:28,246 --> 00:38:30,182
put your shoes on.

544
00:38:33,784 --> 00:38:36,952
I... I asked you nice.

545
00:38:36,954 --> 00:38:40,224
Now I need y'all
to get off my property.

546
00:38:51,001 --> 00:38:52,471
Okay.

547
00:39:09,353 --> 00:39:11,887
Okay, let's call the cops.

548
00:39:11,889 --> 00:39:14,356
I did.
They're 14 minutes away.

549
00:39:14,358 --> 00:39:16,892
What? 14 minutes?

550
00:39:16,894 --> 00:39:20,162
Okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay.

551
00:39:20,164 --> 00:39:21,963
Okay, okay.

552
00:39:21,965 --> 00:39:24,499
- Jason, give me the bat.
- What bat?

553
00:39:24,501 --> 00:39:26,202
The baseball bat. The bat.

554
00:39:26,204 --> 00:39:27,936
- There's one in the cl...
- Here, here.

555
00:39:27,938 --> 00:39:29,005
- Thank you.
- Gabe?

556
00:39:29,007 --> 00:39:30,305
All right, hold on.

557
00:39:30,307 --> 00:39:31,941
I got this.
Let's try this again.

558
00:39:31,943 --> 00:39:35,177
- Gabe?
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

559
00:39:35,179 --> 00:39:37,112
All right.

560
00:39:37,114 --> 00:39:39,884
- Gabe!
- I got this. I got this.

561
00:39:43,954 --> 00:39:46,222
Now, I thought
I already done told y'all

562
00:39:46,224 --> 00:39:48,291
to get off my property.

563
00:39:48,293 --> 00:39:53,295
Okay? So, if y'all want to
get crazy, we can get crazy.

564
00:39:53,297 --> 00:39:57,769
Now, the cops are
already on they way.

565
00:40:01,905 --> 00:40:05,273
Hey. Hey, hey, hey!

566
00:40:05,275 --> 00:40:06,511
Hey!

567
00:40:13,451 --> 00:40:14,983
Oh!

568
00:40:14,985 --> 00:40:16,420
Sh...

569
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:22,023
They're going around.

570
00:40:22,025 --> 00:40:23,492
Is the back door locked?

571
00:40:23,494 --> 00:40:25,862
- My window's open.
- Gabe... Zora, no!

572
00:40:25,864 --> 00:40:27,597
Gabe, Jason!

573
00:40:41,112 --> 00:40:43,979
Yo, I'm serious, man!

574
00:40:43,981 --> 00:40:46,081
I will break your head!

575
00:40:46,083 --> 00:40:47,985
If I were you...

576
00:40:54,525 --> 00:40:56,525
Gabe.

577
00:41:31,362 --> 00:41:33,262
- The key.
- What key?

578
00:41:33,264 --> 00:41:35,067
- The damn hide-a-key.
- Hide-a-key?

579
00:41:36,166 --> 00:41:38,469
What kind of white shit...?

580
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:48,110
Oh, shit.

581
00:42:27,985 --> 00:42:31,186
- Mom?
- Just stay close.

582
00:42:31,188 --> 00:42:33,289
What's going on?

583
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,099
What?

584
00:44:24,101 --> 00:44:26,434
It's us.

585
00:44:36,414 --> 00:44:38,380
We don't have anything here.

586
00:44:38,382 --> 00:44:40,316
This is our summer home.

587
00:44:40,318 --> 00:44:42,617
- Gabe.
- We just got in today, so...

588
00:44:42,619 --> 00:44:44,753
Once...

589
00:44:44,755 --> 00:44:46,391
upon...

590
00:44:49,226 --> 00:44:51,730
...a t-ime...

591
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:57,833
...there was a girl.

592
00:44:57,835 --> 00:45:01,903
And the girl had...

593
00:45:01,905 --> 00:45:03,842
a sh-adow.

594
00:45:07,545 --> 00:45:12,313
The two were connected,

595
00:45:12,315 --> 00:45:14,682
tethered together.

596
00:45:14,684 --> 00:45:17,786
When the girl ate,

597
00:45:17,788 --> 00:45:20,789
her food was given to her

598
00:45:20,791 --> 00:45:23,791
warm and tasty.

599
00:45:23,793 --> 00:45:27,463
But when the shadow was hungry,

600
00:45:27,465 --> 00:45:29,465
she had to eat rabbit,

601
00:45:29,467 --> 00:45:33,235
raw and bloody.

602
00:45:33,237 --> 00:45:35,804
On Christmas,

603
00:45:35,806 --> 00:45:39,675
the girl received
wonderful toys,

604
00:45:39,677 --> 00:45:42,878
soft and cushy.

605
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:47,182
But the shadow's toys
were so sharp and cold,

606
00:45:47,184 --> 00:45:49,284
they'd slice
through her fingers

607
00:45:49,286 --> 00:45:51,854
when she tried
to play with them.

608
00:45:51,856 --> 00:45:56,624
The girl met a handsome prince

609
00:45:56,626 --> 00:45:58,626
and fell in love,

610
00:45:58,628 --> 00:46:03,599
but the shadow,
at that same time,

611
00:46:03,601 --> 00:46:05,800
met Abraham.

612
00:46:05,802 --> 00:46:10,773
It didn't matter
if she loved him or not.

613
00:46:10,775 --> 00:46:14,876
He was tethered to
the girl's prince, after all.

614
00:46:14,878 --> 00:46:20,249
Then the girl had
her first child,

615
00:46:20,251 --> 00:46:22,550
a beautiful baby girl.

616
00:46:22,552 --> 00:46:24,920
But the shadow,

617
00:46:24,922 --> 00:46:28,757
she gave birth
to a little monster.

618
00:46:28,759 --> 00:46:32,760
Umbrae was born laughing.

619
00:46:32,762 --> 00:46:36,999
The girl had a second child,
a boy this time.

620
00:46:37,001 --> 00:46:42,338
They had to cut her open
and take him from her belly.

621
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:46,541
The shadow had to do it all...

622
00:46:46,543 --> 00:46:49,411
herself.

623
00:46:49,413 --> 00:46:50,878
She named him Pluto.

624
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,682
He was born to love fire.

625
00:46:54,684 --> 00:46:59,554
So, you see,
the shadow hated the girl

626
00:46:59,556 --> 00:47:03,025
so much for so long,

627
00:47:03,027 --> 00:47:07,996
until one day
the shadow realized

628
00:47:07,998 --> 00:47:13,204
she was being tested by God.

629
00:47:18,775 --> 00:47:20,411
Excuse me.

630
00:47:21,978 --> 00:47:23,747
Excuse me.

631
00:47:25,815 --> 00:47:27,749
What do you want?

632
00:47:27,751 --> 00:47:29,851
You could have my wallet.

633
00:47:29,853 --> 00:47:31,686
You-you could have the car.

634
00:47:31,688 --> 00:47:33,421
Gabe.

635
00:47:33,423 --> 00:47:35,360
Yeah.

636
00:47:37,894 --> 00:47:40,461
You can have the boat,
for all I care.

637
00:47:40,463 --> 00:47:43,699
Nobody wants the boat, Dad.

638
00:47:43,701 --> 00:47:45,467
How about this?

639
00:47:45,469 --> 00:47:47,469
You take me to the ATM...

640
00:47:57,081 --> 00:47:59,317
What are you people?

641
00:48:04,487 --> 00:48:07,291
We're Americans.

642
00:48:18,436 --> 00:48:21,503
Tether yourself to the table.

643
00:48:24,442 --> 00:48:25,507
Addy, don't do it.

644
00:48:25,509 --> 00:48:27,342
Maybe I should cut...

645
00:48:27,344 --> 00:48:29,380
something off of you.

646
00:48:31,581 --> 00:48:34,318
It's... it's okay.

647
00:48:55,106 --> 00:48:57,042
Just...

648
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:01,713
Don't hurt my children.

649
00:49:24,668 --> 00:49:26,401
Yo.

650
00:49:43,521 --> 00:49:44,952
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Get your hands off me.

651
00:49:44,954 --> 00:49:46,421
- No. Gabe, no.
- No, wait, no. Dad!

652
00:49:46,423 --> 00:49:47,923
Wait. Wait.

653
00:49:47,925 --> 00:49:49,490
Get off me, man.

654
00:49:49,492 --> 00:49:51,159
Look, Gabe...

655
00:49:51,161 --> 00:49:53,695
Wait. Gabe.

656
00:49:53,697 --> 00:49:55,831
Oh, please,
please, please stop!

657
00:49:55,833 --> 00:49:57,465
- Stop, please!
- Gabe.

658
00:49:58,702 --> 00:50:00,869
Stop, stop. Wait. Wait.

659
00:50:00,871 --> 00:50:03,838
Wai... Please!

660
00:50:05,175 --> 00:50:07,175
Okay. Okay.

661
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:16,855
- Mom.
- Little girl.

662
00:50:18,088 --> 00:50:19,958
Run!

663
00:50:21,192 --> 00:50:23,827
Go.

664
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:55,657
You want me, right?

665
00:51:02,632 --> 00:51:03,932
No.

666
00:51:03,934 --> 00:51:06,168
- He's not going.
- Careful.

667
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:09,771
He has a t-emper.

668
00:51:37,867 --> 00:51:41,036
No, no, no, no, no, no,

669
00:51:41,038 --> 00:51:43,740
no, no, no, not that shit.

670
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:48,142
No. No.

671
00:51:48,144 --> 00:51:50,081
Okay.

672
00:51:51,681 --> 00:51:53,180
- I'm scared.
- Look...

673
00:51:53,182 --> 00:51:54,916
Look at me.

674
00:51:54,918 --> 00:51:57,221
You're gonna be okay.

675
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:04,726
Show him one of your tricks.

676
00:52:04,728 --> 00:52:06,595
Okay.

677
00:52:08,932 --> 00:52:10,632
Go play, boys.

678
00:52:14,237 --> 00:52:19,007
Don't burn our house down.

679
00:52:43,032 --> 00:52:44,365
Stop, man.

680
00:52:44,367 --> 00:52:46,133
Please stop.

681
00:52:46,135 --> 00:52:48,306
No, no, stop, stop, stop.

682
00:52:50,139 --> 00:52:51,840
Please.

683
00:52:51,842 --> 00:52:53,708
Come on, man, stop.

684
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:55,376
Stop it.

685
00:52:56,947 --> 00:52:59,280
I got a family, man.
Please don't. No.

686
00:55:16,385 --> 00:55:18,322
What the fuck?

687
00:55:20,891 --> 00:55:23,327
Get off my car!

688
00:55:26,163 --> 00:55:29,164
Are you...?
Come here. Come...

689
00:55:29,166 --> 00:55:31,436
Goddamn it,
get your ass over here.

690
00:55:36,773 --> 00:55:39,240
I said, "Come here."

691
00:55:39,242 --> 00:55:40,941
Kid, I'm talking to you.

692
00:55:48,918 --> 00:55:51,054
What do you want?

693
00:55:59,429 --> 00:56:01,231
What?

694
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:09,740
What do we want?

695
00:56:11,809 --> 00:56:13,974
We want...

696
00:56:13,976 --> 00:56:16,413
to take our t-ime.

697
00:56:18,081 --> 00:56:21,449
We've been waiting for this day

698
00:56:21,451 --> 00:56:24,088
for so long.

699
00:56:26,356 --> 00:56:28,389
I call it...

700
00:56:28,391 --> 00:56:32,163
"The Untethering."

701
00:58:54,304 --> 00:58:56,104
That's yours.

702
01:00:30,333 --> 01:00:32,467
It hangs to the left.

703
01:00:32,469 --> 01:00:34,672
It hangs to the goddamn left.

704
01:02:06,795 --> 01:02:08,498
Jason.

705
01:02:28,251 --> 01:02:30,617
Jason.

706
01:02:33,255 --> 01:02:34,688
Baby.

707
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:36,324
Come on. Come on.

708
01:02:38,961 --> 01:02:40,662
Let's go.

709
01:02:45,869 --> 01:02:47,601
Keys.

710
01:02:51,708 --> 01:02:54,541
- Mom! Mom!
- Zora!

711
01:02:58,215 --> 01:02:59,880
This way. Come on!

712
01:02:59,882 --> 01:03:01,451
Come on, come on!
Go, go, go!

713
01:03:03,353 --> 01:03:04,952
Hey!

714
01:03:14,264 --> 01:03:16,530
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on,

715
01:03:16,532 --> 01:03:19,300
come on, come on, come on.

716
01:03:21,003 --> 01:03:24,572
Oh. Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go!

717
01:04:09,385 --> 01:04:12,586
- Josh? What was that?
- What?

718
01:04:12,588 --> 01:04:14,488
I heard something outside.

719
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:17,358
Okay.

720
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:19,594
A rustling.
Walking, like a person.

721
01:04:19,596 --> 01:04:21,862
There's a person walking around
outside our fucking house.

722
01:04:21,864 --> 01:04:23,865
It's probably a squirrel.
I don't know.

723
01:04:23,867 --> 01:04:25,603
Would you please get up
and look?

724
01:04:26,936 --> 01:04:29,704
I'm busy.
I'm... I'm busy.

725
01:04:29,706 --> 01:04:31,275
So...

726
01:04:33,543 --> 01:04:36,677
Maybe it's a-a pizza guy.
Maybe the girls ordered pizza.

727
01:04:36,679 --> 01:04:39,079
Get up and take a look.
I'm scared.

728
01:04:39,081 --> 01:04:40,914
Oh, I don't want to.
I want to stay down here.

729
01:04:40,916 --> 01:04:42,617
I want to just stay
in my cozy spot.

730
01:04:42,619 --> 01:04:44,351
- Get up and look.
- Jesus Christ.

731
01:04:44,353 --> 01:04:46,320
Hey, uh, Ophelia, lights up.

732
01:04:46,322 --> 01:04:48,523
Turning lights up.

733
01:04:48,525 --> 01:04:50,958
I feel like I heard the
backup generator go on, too.

734
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:52,860
What do you know
about the backup generator?

735
01:04:52,862 --> 01:04:54,896
Can you stop being
an asshole for two seconds?

736
01:04:54,898 --> 01:04:56,998
- Just look.
- All right. I'm looking.

737
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,800
I'll get my binoculars.

738
01:04:58,802 --> 01:05:01,702
I see nothing.
I see beautiful stars.

739
01:05:01,704 --> 01:05:03,371
Are you really looking?

740
01:05:03,373 --> 01:05:05,505
Yeah, I'm looking.

741
01:05:05,507 --> 01:05:07,575
Oh, shit.
No, yeah, I...

742
01:05:07,577 --> 01:05:09,510
- There's something out there.
- Don't fuck with me, Josh.

743
01:05:09,512 --> 01:05:10,978
I'm not fucking with you.
I'm serious.

744
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:12,347
There's something out there.
Look.

745
01:05:12,349 --> 01:05:13,981
Look behind the car.

746
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:15,983
- Where? I don't see it.
- It's by the car.

747
01:05:15,985 --> 01:05:17,517
- Look.
- I can't...

748
01:05:17,519 --> 01:05:19,019
- Oh, shit.
- What?

749
01:05:19,021 --> 01:05:21,722
Oh, my God, it's O.J.

750
01:05:21,724 --> 01:05:24,958
It's O.J. Simpson.

751
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:27,662
What is wrong with you?
Seriously.

752
01:05:28,998 --> 01:05:30,430
Ophelia,
give me some Beach Boys.

753
01:05:30,432 --> 01:05:31,599
Playing "Good Vibrations"

754
01:05:31,601 --> 01:05:32,766
- by the Beach Boys.
- Really? - Why not?

755
01:05:32,768 --> 01:05:34,668
It's our last night here.

756
01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:36,503
- Let's have a little party.
- Ophelia, turn it down.

757
01:05:36,505 --> 01:05:38,139
Turning down "Good
Vibrations" by the Beach Boys.

758
01:05:38,141 --> 01:05:40,041
Would you chill out, all right?
There's nobody out there.

759
01:05:40,043 --> 01:05:42,043
Just go back upstairs.
I'll be up in a few minutes.

760
01:05:42,045 --> 01:05:43,644
Everything's gonna be fine.

761
01:05:43,646 --> 01:05:45,612
What's going on?

762
01:05:45,614 --> 01:05:47,148
Uh, nothing.

763
01:05:47,150 --> 01:05:48,548
- Nothing, guys.
- Jesus.

764
01:05:48,550 --> 01:05:49,883
The backup generator went on.

765
01:05:49,885 --> 01:05:51,619
We're just trying
to figure it out.

766
01:05:51,621 --> 01:05:53,621
- Go back to sleep.
- Just because we're in our rooms

767
01:05:53,623 --> 01:05:55,055
doesn't mean we're sleeping.

768
01:05:55,057 --> 01:05:56,891
Fine. I don't know.
Go back to your rooms.

769
01:05:56,893 --> 01:05:58,492
Guys, we have to be out of here

770
01:05:58,494 --> 01:05:59,894
at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow,
sharp, so...

771
01:06:01,697 --> 01:06:03,697
- Hello?
- Oh, my God.

772
01:06:06,001 --> 01:06:07,802
Josh!

773
01:07:23,545 --> 01:07:25,713
Please stop.

774
01:07:25,715 --> 01:07:29,550
Stopping "Good
Vibrations" by the Beach Boys.

775
01:07:32,621 --> 01:07:34,557
Ophelia...

776
01:07:36,893 --> 01:07:39,025
Ophelia, call the police.

777
01:07:39,027 --> 01:07:40,494
Sure.

778
01:07:40,496 --> 01:07:43,097
Playing "Fuck tha Police"
by N.W.A.

779
01:07:57,179 --> 01:08:00,680
Josh, we need your help.

780
01:08:07,556 --> 01:08:09,891
Addy!

781
01:08:12,661 --> 01:08:15,128
Addy!

782
01:08:15,130 --> 01:08:17,264
No!

783
01:08:17,266 --> 01:08:19,834
No! No! No! No!

784
01:08:21,738 --> 01:08:24,007
Go, go, go, go, go, go. Run.

785
01:08:36,953 --> 01:08:38,919
Come here!

786
01:08:38,921 --> 01:08:41,791
Huh? Follow me!

787
01:08:42,926 --> 01:08:44,659
Yeah.

788
01:08:46,328 --> 01:08:48,696
Let's go, Bad Josh!

789
01:08:48,698 --> 01:08:51,132
Let's go!

790
01:08:53,002 --> 01:08:55,135
Hey!

791
01:09:31,207 --> 01:09:34,040
No! No! No!

792
01:12:47,904 --> 01:12:50,103
Come on!

793
01:12:50,105 --> 01:12:52,442
Goddamn it.

794
01:15:12,581 --> 01:15:15,281
No, no, no, no. Please.

795
01:15:15,283 --> 01:15:17,518
No, no. No.
No, no. No.

796
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:19,352
No! No, no.

797
01:15:19,354 --> 01:15:21,187
No, Zora. No!

798
01:15:21,189 --> 01:15:23,389
Please, please.

799
01:15:23,391 --> 01:15:26,125
No! No!

800
01:15:26,127 --> 01:15:28,062
No, please, no!

801
01:15:28,064 --> 01:15:31,365
No, no, no.

802
01:15:56,591 --> 01:15:58,659
It was unlocked.

803
01:15:58,661 --> 01:16:02,428
Boats are done.

804
01:16:02,430 --> 01:16:04,430
I am done with boats.

805
01:16:16,145 --> 01:16:18,711
I can't believe they're dead.

806
01:16:20,682 --> 01:16:22,683
Why are they doing this?

807
01:16:22,685 --> 01:16:24,718
I'm sorry,
but all of our operators

808
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:26,452
are busy at the moment.

809
01:16:26,454 --> 01:16:28,187
Please hold, and the next
available operator will...

810
01:16:28,189 --> 01:16:29,790
It's all just craziness.

811
01:16:29,792 --> 01:16:32,291
I'm sorry,
but all of our operators

812
01:16:32,293 --> 01:16:33,729
are busy at the moment.
Please...

813
01:16:35,530 --> 01:16:38,499
How does 911 keep you on hold
all night long?

814
01:16:38,501 --> 01:16:40,567
I just don't get it.

815
01:16:40,569 --> 01:16:43,070
It's too many twins, man.

816
01:16:50,046 --> 01:16:52,345
How many of everybody
is there gonna be?

817
01:17:04,159 --> 01:17:05,259
<i>The boardwalk
was getting ready to close,</i>

818
01:17:05,261 --> 01:17:06,660
<i>and a bunch of us
had just gotten out,</i>

819
01:17:06,662 --> 01:17:09,329
<i>and we were going to our cars
when the attack happened.</i>

820
01:17:09,331 --> 01:17:10,496
- Oh, shit.
- <i>People were shouting, and...</i>

821
01:17:10,498 --> 01:17:11,732
- Don't curse.
- <i>...I-I just thought it was</i>

822
01:17:11,734 --> 01:17:14,201
<i>somebody acting out,
and then we just saw red.</i>

823
01:17:14,203 --> 01:17:16,335
- <i>Uh, you saw red?</i>
- <i>Yes, they were wearing red.</i>

824
01:17:16,337 --> 01:17:18,071
<i>They didn't look right.
They had scissors,</i>

825
01:17:18,073 --> 01:17:20,307
<i>and they were just walking up
to people in the crowd</i>

826
01:17:20,309 --> 01:17:21,808
<i>and stabbing them.</i>

827
01:17:21,810 --> 01:17:23,843
<i>You said
they were stabbing people?</i>

828
01:17:23,845 --> 01:17:25,379
<i>Yeah, it was chaos,</i>

829
01:17:25,381 --> 01:17:27,080
<i>and then we-we just
started running.</i>

830
01:17:27,082 --> 01:17:28,315
<i>Where-where did they come from?</i>

831
01:17:28,317 --> 01:17:29,849
<i>What? I-I-I don't know.</i>

832
01:17:29,851 --> 01:17:32,218
<i>Someone said that they were
coming from the sewers.</i>

833
01:17:32,220 --> 01:17:34,187
<i>The sewers?
Okay, how many are...</i>

834
01:17:34,189 --> 01:17:36,123
<i>I'm sorry.
I think they're coming.</i>

835
01:17:36,125 --> 01:17:38,625
<i>Uh, uh, ma'am?</i>

836
01:17:38,627 --> 01:17:41,327
<i>Ma'am?</i>

837
01:17:41,329 --> 01:17:45,365
<i>Um, okay, uh, so we certainly
hope everything is okay there.</i>

838
01:17:45,367 --> 01:17:48,335
<i>It's too early to say
what exactly is unfolding,</i>

839
01:17:48,337 --> 01:17:50,470
<i>but it does appear
we are in the midst</i>

840
01:17:50,472 --> 01:17:52,473
<i>of a brutal
and terrifying attack</i>

841
01:17:52,475 --> 01:17:55,241
<i>by people who are being
described as wearing red,</i>

842
01:17:55,243 --> 01:17:56,876
<i>carrying scissors or shears,
and doing</i>

843
01:17:56,878 --> 01:17:59,513
<i>what can only be described
as wreaking havoc on folks</i>

844
01:17:59,515 --> 01:18:02,348
- <i>just out for a Friday night.</i>
- And they look like us.

845
01:18:02,350 --> 01:18:04,351
They don't even know that yet.

846
01:18:04,353 --> 01:18:06,120
<i>Okay, Chris,
I'm gonna cut you off.</i>

847
01:18:06,122 --> 01:18:08,625
- <i>Okay.</i>
- <i>We have new images coming in here.</i>

848
01:18:11,226 --> 01:18:13,759
<i>Here, we see a man</i>

849
01:18:13,761 --> 01:18:16,562
<i>wearing red who...</i>

850
01:18:16,564 --> 01:18:18,264
<i>Okay, this...</i>

851
01:18:18,266 --> 01:18:21,268
<i>this seems to be
a group of individuals</i>

852
01:18:21,270 --> 01:18:25,606
<i>engaged in some sort
of demonstration or protest.</i>

853
01:18:25,608 --> 01:18:28,608
<i>It-it's not clear at this time
if or how</i>

854
01:18:28,610 --> 01:18:29,777
<i>these people are connected
to the attacks.</i>

855
01:18:29,779 --> 01:18:31,644
- What is that?
- <i>They are forming what looks</i>

856
01:18:31,646 --> 01:18:33,312
- <i>like a human chain.</i>
- That's them.

857
01:18:33,314 --> 01:18:35,148
What are they doing?

858
01:18:35,150 --> 01:18:36,583
I don't know,
but that would take

859
01:18:36,585 --> 01:18:38,755
a shitload of coordination.

860
01:18:40,655 --> 01:18:42,589
<i>So, obviously,
if you have children present</i>

861
01:18:42,591 --> 01:18:45,259
<i>watching us right now,
you should turn them away.</i>

862
01:18:45,261 --> 01:18:47,628
<i>We aren't sure
what is about to happen.</i>

863
01:18:49,864 --> 01:18:53,232
- We have to go.
- What? You're joking, right?

864
01:18:53,234 --> 01:18:55,501
Zora, Jason, help your father.

865
01:18:55,503 --> 01:18:57,905
Wait, she's trippin'.
Where would we go?

866
01:18:57,907 --> 01:18:59,572
- The police, right?
- No.

867
01:18:59,574 --> 01:19:01,808
We need to move
and keep moving.

868
01:19:01,810 --> 01:19:03,277
We take the coast.

869
01:19:03,279 --> 01:19:05,411
- We go to Mexico.
- Mexico?

870
01:19:05,413 --> 01:19:07,380
Okay. Whoa.

871
01:19:07,382 --> 01:19:09,183
Whoa. Whoa!

872
01:19:09,185 --> 01:19:11,718
We got everything we need here.

873
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:13,519
Food, water, backup generator.

874
01:19:13,521 --> 01:19:15,888
We're as safe here
as we're gonna be anywhere.

875
01:19:15,890 --> 01:19:17,759
Tell that to Josh and Kitty.
They're right here.

876
01:19:21,229 --> 01:19:23,629
- You're scaring the kids.
- Too late.

877
01:19:23,631 --> 01:19:26,567
They think like us.
They know where we are.

878
01:19:26,569 --> 01:19:30,336
They won't stop until
they kill us or we kill them.

879
01:19:30,338 --> 01:19:32,606
Then let's make
some traps or something.

880
01:19:32,608 --> 01:19:34,607
Like, some <i>Home Alone</i>
type stuff.

881
01:19:34,609 --> 01:19:35,742
That way, if she comes...

882
01:19:35,744 --> 01:19:37,811
Tell me you did not
just reference <i>Home Alone.</i>

883
01:19:37,813 --> 01:19:39,845
- You know what I'm talking about.
- Gabe.

884
01:19:39,847 --> 01:19:41,682
They've been planning this.

885
01:19:41,684 --> 01:19:43,517
They have the upper hand.

886
01:19:43,519 --> 01:19:45,518
This is the time to run,

887
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:48,824
not to be sprinkling
Micro Machines on the floor.

888
01:19:49,925 --> 01:19:51,424
What are Micro Machines?

889
01:19:51,426 --> 01:19:52,960
What's <i>Home Alone?</i>

890
01:19:52,962 --> 01:19:55,629
We're not going anywhere,
and that's final.

891
01:19:55,631 --> 01:19:58,868
You don't get to make
the decisions anymore!

892
01:20:04,939 --> 01:20:07,473
So...

893
01:20:07,475 --> 01:20:10,380
does this mean
we get their car?

894
01:20:13,349 --> 01:20:15,949
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

895
01:20:15,951 --> 01:20:17,718
Who's got the keys?

896
01:21:45,974 --> 01:21:47,710
Come on.

897
01:21:50,945 --> 01:21:52,713
- Let's go.
- Get in the car.

898
01:21:52,715 --> 01:21:54,380
Get in the car.

899
01:21:55,751 --> 01:21:57,451
- I'm driving.
- No way.

900
01:21:57,453 --> 01:21:59,018
I told her no.

901
01:21:59,020 --> 01:22:00,887
Dad's leg is messed up.
You're handcuffed.

902
01:22:00,889 --> 01:22:02,555
It's not safe.
I'm driving.

903
01:22:02,557 --> 01:22:03,956
Zora, no.

904
01:22:03,958 --> 01:22:05,858
I have the highest kill count
in the family.

905
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:07,660
You don't have
the highest kill count.

906
01:22:07,662 --> 01:22:08,928
I killed both twins.

907
01:22:08,930 --> 01:22:10,796
Wrong.
I just killed the second one.

908
01:22:10,798 --> 01:22:12,499
I killed Kitty.

909
01:22:12,501 --> 01:22:15,568
So that's one, one,
one and two. I killed two.

910
01:22:15,570 --> 01:22:17,603
I killed myself and Josh, so...

911
01:22:17,605 --> 01:22:18,804
Zo... It doesn't matter.

912
01:22:18,806 --> 01:22:20,473
Zora, get in the back.

913
01:22:20,475 --> 01:22:22,075
- Look! - No.
- Oh, shit, put the windows up.

914
01:22:22,077 --> 01:22:23,646
Put the windows up.
Put the windows up.

915
01:22:38,627 --> 01:22:40,026
Okay.

916
01:22:40,028 --> 01:22:42,129
You're gonna want to...

917
01:22:42,131 --> 01:22:44,033
back up.

918
01:22:45,868 --> 01:22:47,737
- Buckle up.
- Huh?

919
01:22:50,805 --> 01:22:52,805
- Zora!
- Whoa...

920
01:22:52,807 --> 01:22:55,875
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

921
01:22:55,877 --> 01:22:57,811
Where is she? Did I get her?

922
01:23:09,056 --> 01:23:11,057
She's there, she's there!

923
01:23:11,059 --> 01:23:12,425
Jesus!

924
01:23:20,034 --> 01:23:21,503
Okay.

925
01:23:37,085 --> 01:23:40,019
Zora.

926
01:23:40,021 --> 01:23:42,455
Be careful.

927
01:23:43,625 --> 01:23:45,858
Okay, you're going too fast!

928
01:23:51,632 --> 01:23:53,168
She's dead now, right?

929
01:23:58,673 --> 01:24:00,540
- What are you doing?
- Mom.

930
01:24:00,542 --> 01:24:02,241
Where's she going?
Wait... And she left.

931
01:24:02,243 --> 01:24:04,710
Your mom left the car.

932
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:47,653
Shh, shh.

933
01:24:57,733 --> 01:24:59,098
Shh.

934
01:26:37,332 --> 01:26:39,933
Whoa.

935
01:26:39,935 --> 01:26:42,134
Is that our car?

936
01:26:42,136 --> 01:26:44,303
It's the one
that looks like me.

937
01:26:46,675 --> 01:26:47,941
Shit.

938
01:26:47,943 --> 01:26:49,579
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What, what?

939
01:27:07,929 --> 01:27:10,833
Stay in the car.
Lock the doors.

940
01:27:41,262 --> 01:27:43,295
What is she doing?

941
01:28:05,787 --> 01:28:07,356
It's a trap.

942
01:28:09,291 --> 01:28:11,159
Get out.

943
01:28:31,512 --> 01:28:33,215
Please.

944
01:28:46,895 --> 01:28:48,364
No.

945
01:29:02,978 --> 01:29:05,247
No.

946
01:29:29,837 --> 01:29:32,340
Jason. Jason!

947
01:29:33,841 --> 01:29:35,508
Jason?

948
01:29:35,510 --> 01:29:37,246
Jason!

949
01:29:39,314 --> 01:29:41,113
Jason!

950
01:29:41,115 --> 01:29:43,415
No! No!

951
01:29:43,417 --> 01:29:45,285
- Addy!
- Mom!

952
01:34:47,889 --> 01:34:49,488
Here.

953
01:34:49,490 --> 01:34:50,889
- We can hide here.
- Okay.

954
01:34:50,891 --> 01:34:53,392
- They probably got bandages and stuff.
- Okay.

955
01:34:55,697 --> 01:34:57,463
Mom knows what to do.

956
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:08,210
Look.

957
01:35:11,613 --> 01:35:13,315
It's the line.

958
01:35:16,917 --> 01:35:20,322
Looks like some kind
of fucked-up performance art.

959
01:35:48,248 --> 01:35:50,816
Where is he?

960
01:35:54,521 --> 01:35:58,527
How it must have been
to grow up with the sky.

961
01:35:59,827 --> 01:36:04,196
To feel the sun,
the wind, the trees.

962
01:36:04,198 --> 01:36:07,633
But your people
took it for granted.

963
01:36:07,635 --> 01:36:10,503
We're human, too, you know.

964
01:36:10,505 --> 01:36:13,539
Eyes, teeth,

965
01:36:13,541 --> 01:36:16,378
hands, blood.

966
01:36:17,478 --> 01:36:20,245
Exactly like you.

967
01:36:22,250 --> 01:36:24,349
And yet...

968
01:36:24,351 --> 01:36:27,753
it was humans

969
01:36:27,755 --> 01:36:29,955
that built this place.

970
01:36:29,957 --> 01:36:34,893
I believe they figured out
how to make a copy of the body

971
01:36:34,895 --> 01:36:36,896
but not the soul.

972
01:36:36,898 --> 01:36:40,799
The soul remains one,
shared by two.

973
01:36:40,801 --> 01:36:43,835
They created the T-ethered

974
01:36:43,837 --> 01:36:48,708
so they could use them
to control the ones above.

975
01:36:48,710 --> 01:36:50,279
Like puppets.

976
01:36:51,779 --> 01:36:56,715
But they failed, and they
ab-andoned the Tethered.

977
01:36:56,717 --> 01:37:00,785
For generations, the Tethered
continued without direction.

978
01:37:02,489 --> 01:37:04,893
They all went mad down here.

979
01:37:08,829 --> 01:37:12,865
And then... there was us.

980
01:37:15,302 --> 01:37:16,902
Put some heat on that one.

981
01:37:16,904 --> 01:37:19,405
Yeah, I guess
I missed my chance to go pro.

982
01:37:19,407 --> 01:37:20,909
<i>You remember?</i>

983
01:37:26,814 --> 01:37:30,683
We were born special.

984
01:37:30,685 --> 01:37:33,952
- I want number 11.
- Yeah?

985
01:38:19,033 --> 01:38:20,933
Addy, you want to try it?

986
01:38:44,992 --> 01:38:49,928
God brought us tog-ether
that night.

987
01:39:36,543 --> 01:39:40,414
I never st-op thinking
about you.

988
01:39:42,182 --> 01:39:45,151
<i>How things could have been.</i>

989
01:39:45,153 --> 01:39:48,787
<i>How you could have
taken me with you.</i>

990
01:39:52,126 --> 01:39:54,160
Years after we met...

991
01:39:56,497 --> 01:39:58,533
<i>...the miracle happened.</i>

992
01:40:01,435 --> 01:40:03,902
<i>That's when I saw God,</i>

993
01:40:03,904 --> 01:40:07,839
<i>and he showed me my path.</i>

994
01:40:07,841 --> 01:40:09,942
<i>You felt it, too.</i>

995
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:15,447
<i>The end of our dance,</i>

996
01:40:15,449 --> 01:40:19,218
<i>the Tethered saw
that I was different.</i>

997
01:40:19,220 --> 01:40:23,022
<i>That I would deliver them
from this misery.</i>

998
01:40:23,024 --> 01:40:26,125
I found my faith,

999
01:40:26,127 --> 01:40:28,964
and I began to prepare.

1000
01:40:30,530 --> 01:40:33,732
<i>It took years to plan.</i>

1001
01:40:39,707 --> 01:40:42,110
<i>Everything had to be perfect.</i>

1002
01:40:45,846 --> 01:40:48,613
<i>I didn't just need to kill you.</i>

1003
01:40:48,615 --> 01:40:51,784
<i>I needed to m-ake a statement</i>

1004
01:40:51,786 --> 01:40:54,722
<i>that the whole world would see.</i>

1005
01:40:58,158 --> 01:41:00,593
It's our time now.

1006
01:41:00,595 --> 01:41:03,597
Our t-ime up there.

1007
01:41:15,810 --> 01:41:18,043
And to think,

1008
01:41:18,045 --> 01:41:20,181
if it weren't for you...

1009
01:41:22,850 --> 01:41:26,087
...I never would have
danced at all.

1010
01:46:39,065 --> 01:46:41,567
My baby. My baby.

1011
01:46:41,569 --> 01:46:43,869
I found you.

1012
01:46:43,871 --> 01:46:45,172
Oh!

1013
01:46:47,574 --> 01:46:49,107
Look.

1014
01:46:49,109 --> 01:46:50,545
Look, look, look.

1015
01:46:59,587 --> 01:47:02,888
They're all gone now.

1016
01:47:02,890 --> 01:47:04,423
Okay?

1017
01:47:04,425 --> 01:47:06,360
They can't hurt you.

1018
01:47:08,229 --> 01:47:10,298
You understand?

1019
01:47:11,465 --> 01:47:13,397
Uh-uh.

1020
01:47:15,402 --> 01:47:17,302
No.

1021
01:47:17,304 --> 01:47:20,007
Everything's gonna be
like it was before.

1022
01:47:25,578 --> 01:47:27,514
Yeah.

1023
01:48:36,382 --> 01:48:38,650
She wasn't in 'Nam.

1024
01:48:38,652 --> 01:48:40,986
<i>Okay? She got lost.
For 15 minutes. That's...</i>

1025
01:48:40,988 --> 01:48:42,521
<i>That can be very scary.</i>

1026
01:48:42,523 --> 01:48:44,423
<i>No, you don't know
what happened to her.</i>

1027
01:48:44,425 --> 01:48:46,991
- Anything could've happened to her.
- Okay, okay.

1028
01:48:46,993 --> 01:48:49,961
So how-how...
how do we get her to talk?

1029
01:48:49,963 --> 01:48:52,597
<i>Encourage her to draw,</i>

1030
01:48:52,599 --> 01:48:54,598
<i>to write, to dance.</i>

1031
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:57,235
<i>Anything to help her
tell us her story.</i>

1032
01:48:58,972 --> 01:49:02,076
I just want
my little girl back.

1033
01:50:11,177 --> 01:50:13,178
<i>Okay? She left.</i>

1034
01:50:13,180 --> 01:50:15,580
- She...
- I told you to look after her.

1035
01:50:15,582 --> 01:50:17,682
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Look at you.

1036
01:50:17,684 --> 01:50:19,584
- It's not my fault she left.
- Look at you.

1037
01:50:19,586 --> 01:50:21,553
It's not my fault
she... Yeah, well, look at me.

1038
01:50:21,555 --> 01:50:22,757
Look at you. Look at you!
