Hey, that capoeira shit was amazing.

1830
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:03,044
But you learned some of that shit
from me too. Right, James?

1831
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:06,409
James. What's going on here?
What the hell did you do to my boat?

1832
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:07,686
Man, fuck this boat!

1833

We taking the evidence that you framed
your son-in-law with, sick son of a bitch.

1834
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:13,925
How could you do this to me, Martin?
Ten years in prison?

1835
01:36:14,120 --> 01:36:16,566
James, you realize
that I didn't mean to hurt you.

1836
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:19,087
I'm very fond of you,
but Himalayan Tiger tanked...

1837
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:23,450
...and I had to get the money from somewhere.
I had no choice. It was you or me.

1838
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:25,125
That sounds like a choice!

1839
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:28,409
James, fuck him. We're leaving.

1840
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:31,769

some fraud shit, get an iPad.

- Alissa.

01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:39,887
- James. Daddy, what's he doing here?
MARTIN: It's fine, honey.

1844
01:36:40,240 --> 01:36:41,287
Uh, James.

1845
01:36:41,480 --> 01:36:45,121
I have a wonderful idea.
Why don't you come with us?

1846
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:49,331
We'll start a whole new life in Cape Verde
and nobody has to go to prison.

- Were you in on this?
- No, not at first.

1850
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:01,683
And when he told me about it,
I was really mad at him.

1851
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:04,770
But then he explained how he was able
to hide most of the money...

1852
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:06,450
...so, really, there's no harm done.

1853
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:11,123
James, now there's still time
to get everything you want.

1854
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:13,609
Everything.

1855
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:16,965
No! I don't want any of it.

switch off, man? I got nothing left up top.

1858
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:30,647

of everything, didn't you?

1866

You point at him. I'll point at Martin.
