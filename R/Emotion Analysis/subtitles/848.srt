00:32:42,295 --> 00:32:45,047
<P Class=EN>Then again, maybe one of us won't.

826
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:52,222
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

827
00:32:52,222 --> 00:32:53,514
<P Class=EN>- You, go ahead.<br>- Me?

828
00:32:53,514 --> 00:32:53,682
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

829
00:32:53,682 --> 00:32:55,058
<P Class=EN>Yeah.

830
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:55,225
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

831
00:32:55,225 --> 00:32:59,270
<P Class=EN>My name's Dewey Oxberger.<br>My friends call me Ox.

832
00:32:59,270 --> 00:32:59,437
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

833
00:32:59,437 --> 00:33:02,440
<P Class=EN>You might have noticed<br>I've got a slight weight problem.

834
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:02,899
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

835
00:33:02,899 --> 00:33:04,692
<P Class=EN>- No!<br>- Yeah, I do.

836
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:04,859
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

837
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:07,403
<P Class=EN>Anyway, I went to this doctor.

838
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:07,612
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

839
00:33:07,612 --> 00:33:10,906
<P Class=EN>Well, he told me I swallowed<br>a lot of aggression...

840
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:11,116
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

841
00:33:11,116 --> 00:33:13,034
<P Class=EN>...along with a lot of pizzas.

842
00:33:13,034 --> 00:33:13,201
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

843
00:33:13,201 --> 00:33:14,785
<P Class=EN>Pizzas!

844
00:33:14,785 --> 00:33:15,286
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

845
00:33:15,286 --> 00:33:17,329
<P Class=EN>I'm basically a shy person.

846
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:17,539
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

847
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:19,457
<P Class=EN>I'm a shy guy...

848
00:33:19,457 --> 00:33:19,624
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

849
00:33:19,624 --> 00:33:23,210
<P Class=EN>...and he suggested taking one<br>of these aggression-training courses.

850
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:23,378
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

851
00:33:23,378 --> 00:33:27,006
<P Class=EN>You know, these aggressive-training<br>courses like EST, those type of things.

852
00:33:27,006 --> 00:33:27,173
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

853
00:33:27,173 --> 00:33:30,593
<P Class=EN>Anyway, it costs 400 bucks<br>to join this thing.

854
00:33:30,593 --> 00:33:30,802
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

855
00:33:30,802 --> 00:33:33,387
<P Class=EN>Well, I didn't have the money.

856
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:33,555
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

857
00:33:33,555 --> 00:33:38,810
<P Class=EN>And I thought to myself,<br>"Join the Army. It's free. "

858
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:39,019
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

859
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:42,230
<P Class=EN>So I figured while I'm here<br>I'll lose a few pounds.

860
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:42,397
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

861
00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:45,316
<P Class=EN>You got a six- to eight-week training<br>program here, a tough one.

862
00:33:45,316 --> 00:33:45,525
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

863
00:33:45,525 --> 00:33:47,485
<P Class=EN>Which is perfect for me.

864
00:33:47,485 --> 00:33:47,652
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

865
00:33:47,652 --> 00:33:51,822
<P Class=EN>I'm gonna walk out of here<br>a lean, mean, fighting machine.

866
00:33:51,822 --> 00:33:53,491
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

867
00:33:53,491 --> 00:33:55,868
<P Class=EN>- Good thinking, Ox. Real good.<br>- It is.

868
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:56,619
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

869
00:33:56,619 --> 00:33:58,162
<P Class=EN>Ziskey.

870
00:33:58,162 --> 00:33:58,329
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

871
00:33:58,329 --> 00:34:01,123
<P Class=EN>I've always been kind<br>of a pacifist.

872
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:01,750
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

873
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,836
<P Class=EN>When I was a kid my father told me,<br>"Never hit anyone in anger...

874
00:34:04,836 --> 00:34:05,003
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

875
00:34:05,003 --> 00:34:09,007
<P Class=EN>...unless you're absolutely sure<br>you can get away with it. "

876
00:34:09,007 --> 00:34:10,425
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

877
00:34:10,425 --> 00:34:12,510
<P Class=EN>I don't know what kind<br>of soldier I'll make...

878
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:12,677
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

879
00:34:12,677 --> 00:34:18,182
<P Class=EN>...but I want you guys to know that<br>if we ever get into real heavy combat...

880
00:34:18,182 --> 00:34:18,391
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

881
00:34:18,391 --> 00:34:22,353
<P Class=EN>...I'll be right behind you guys<br>every step of the way.

882
00:34:22,353 --> 00:34:26,107
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

883
00:34:26,107 --> 00:34:30,402
<P Class=EN>Okay, Mr. Pushups.<br>Let's hear your story.

884
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:30,904
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

885
00:34:30,904 --> 00:34:34,866
<P Class=EN>Chicks dig me because<br>I rarely wear underwear...

886
00:34:34,866 --> 00:34:35,075
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

887
00:34:35,075 --> 00:34:38,203
<P Class=EN>...and when I do,<br>it's usually something unusual.

888
00:34:38,203 --> 00:34:38,370
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

889
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:43,708
<P Class=EN>But now I know why I have always<br>lost women to guys like you.

890
00:34:43,708 --> 00:34:43,917
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

891
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:46,085
<P Class=EN>It's not just the uniform.

892
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:46,294
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

893
00:34:46,294 --> 00:34:48,754
<P Class=EN>It's the stories that you tell.

894
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:48,922
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

895
00:34:48,922 --> 00:34:51,341
<P Class=EN>So much fun and imagination.

896
00:34:51,341 --> 00:34:51,758
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

897
00:34:51,758 --> 00:34:53,801

00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:53,968
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

00:34:53,968 --> 00:34:57,012

00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:58,390
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

901
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:01,726
<P Class=EN>When you stole that cow...

902
00:35:01,726 --> 00:35:01,935
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

903
00:35:01,935 --> 00:35:05,229
<P Class=EN>...and your friends tried<br>to make it with the cow.

904
00:35:05,229 --> 00:35:05,438
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

905
00:35:05,438 --> 00:35:08,399
<P Class=EN>I want to party with you, cowboy.

906
00:35:08,399 --> 00:35:08,983
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

907
00:35:08,983 --> 00:35:12,236
<P Class=EN>The two of us together,<br>forget it.

908
00:35:12,236 --> 00:35:13,488
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

909
00:35:13,488 --> 00:35:15,740
<P Class=EN>I'm gonna go out on a limb here.

910
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,659
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

911
00:35:17,659 --> 00:35:20,995
<P Class=EN>I'm gonna volunteer my leadership<br>to this platoon.

912
00:35:20,995 --> 00:35:21,204
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

913
00:35:21,204 --> 00:35:24,123
<P Class=EN>An Army without leaders<br>is like a foot...

<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

915
00:35:24,749 --> 00:35:26,584

<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

917
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:29,754
<P Class=EN>And Sergeant Hulka isn't always<br>gonna be there...

918
00:35:29,754 --> 00:35:29,921
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

919
00:35:29,921 --> 00:35:32,548
<P Class=EN>...to be that big toe for us.

920
00:35:32,548 --> 00:35:33,341
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

921
00:35:33,341 --> 00:35:37,219
<P Class=EN>I think that we owe<br>a big round of applause...

922
00:35:37,219 --> 00:35:37,387
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

923
00:35:37,387 --> 00:35:40,348
<P Class=EN>...to our newest, bestest buddy...

931
00:35:56,448 --> 00:35:59,659
<P Class=EN>We're gonna see what kind<br>of soldier you are.

00:35:59,659 --> 00:35:59,826
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

933
00:35:59,826 --> 00:36:02,453

<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

939
00:36:08,043 --> 00:36:12,297
<P Class=EN>And then we're gonna do 10 miles,<br>rain or shine.

940
00:36:12,297 --> 00:36:13,131
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

941
00:36:13,131 --> 00:36:16,300

<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

943
00:36:16,468 --> 00:36:18,470

00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:18,678
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

945
00:36:18,678 --> 00:36:21,347

<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

957

<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

1105
00:44:10,942 --> 00:44:13,945
<P Class=EN>That's just the way<br>we like to keep it, captain.

1106
00:44:13,945 --> 00:44:14,446
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

1107
00:44:14,446 --> 00:44:16,906

<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

1111
00:44:20,827 --> 00:44:24,038

00:44:24,205 --> 00:44:26,957

1114
00:44:26,957 --> 00:44:27,167
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

1115
00:44:27,167 --> 00:44:29,627
<P Class=EN>...and then we'll go<br>our separate ways.

1116
00:44:29,627 --> 00:44:30,086
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

1117
00:44:30,086 --> 00:44:31,962
<P Class=EN>Dismissed, captain.

00:44:31,962 --> 00:44:57,447
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

1119
00:44:57,447 --> 00:44:59,490
<P Class=EN>Okay, major, let's go!

00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:00,075
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

1121
00:45:00,075 --> 00:45:01,326
<P Class=EN>Go!

1122
00:45:01,326 --> 00:45:02,285
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

1123
00:45:02,285 --> 00:45:03,703
<P Class=EN>Go!

1124
00:45:03,703 --> 00:45:05,163
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

1125
00:45:05,163 --> 00:45:06,831
<P Class=EN>Russell!

1126
00:45:06,831 --> 00:45:07,999
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

1127
00:45:07,999 --> 00:45:10,334
<P Class=EN>They're all going backpacking, John!

1128
00:45:10,334 --> 00:45:13,880
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

1129
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,673
<P Class=EN>Go! Go! Go!

1130
00:45:15,673 --> 00:45:31,856
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

1131
00:45:31,856 --> 00:45:34,859
<P Class=EN>The important thing is not to panic.

1132
00:45:34,859 --> 00:45:35,026
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

1133
00:45:35,026 --> 00:45:37,737
<P Class=EN>We should, like, build a shelter,<br>I think.

1134
00:45:37,737 --> 00:45:37,862
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

1135
00:45:37,862 --> 00:45:41,699
<P Class=EN>Then we make some stone tools and<br>we can cut some spears and arrows.

1136
00:45:41,699 --> 00:45:41,908
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

1137
00:45:41,908 --> 00:45:44,368
<P Class=EN>Because tonight we're gonna go out<br>and kill a wild boar.

1138
00:45:44,368 --> 00:45:44,577
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

1139
00:45:44,577 --> 00:45:46,662
<P Class=EN>And then we're gonna dry the meat<br>for travelling.

1140
00:45:46,662 --> 00:45:46,871
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

1141
00:45:46,871 --> 00:45:49,748
<P Class=EN>And in the morning<br>we can chop down a big tree...

1142
00:45:49,748 --> 00:45:49,916
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

1143
00:45:49,916 --> 00:45:51,417
<P Class=EN>...and make a dugout canoe.

1144
00:45:51,417 --> 00:45:51,626
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

1145
00:45:51,626 --> 00:45:55,087
<P Class=EN>And we could find a river<br>that'll probably run down to the ocean.

1146
00:45:55,087 --> 00:45:55,296
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

1147
00:45:55,296 --> 00:45:58,507
<P Class=EN>If we're lucky, we'll drift into<br>one of those major shipping lanes...

1148
00:45:58,507 --> 00:45:58,717
<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

1357
00:54:59,591 --> 00:55:03,595

<P Class=EN>&nbsp;

2321
01:34:09,366 --> 01:34:11,701
<P Class=EN>We'd have that EM-50 back here<br>inside of 24 hours.
