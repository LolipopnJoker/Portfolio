1
00:00:50,552 --> 00:00:52,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anything goes</font>

2
00:01:00,812 --> 00:01:03,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anything goes</font>

3
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:24,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anything goes</font>

4
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:50,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anything goes</font>

5
00:03:10,108 --> 00:03:11,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be careful.</font>

6
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:29,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You never told me you spoke
my language, Dr. Jones.</font>

7
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:32,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only on special occasions.</font>

8
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:35,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, it is true?</font>

9
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:37,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You found Nurhachi?</font>

10
00:03:38,011 --> 00:03:39,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know I did.</font>

11
00:03:39,721 --> 00:03:43,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Last night one of your boys
tried to get Nurhachi</font>

12
00:03:43,141 --> 00:03:44,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">without paying for him.</font>

13
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:46,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have insulted my son.</font>

14
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:48,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you have insulted me.</font>

15
00:03:49,898 --> 00:03:51,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I spared his life.</font>

16
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:53,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aren't you going to introduce us?</font>

17
00:03:57,906 --> 00:03:59,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is Willie Scott.</font>

18
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:03,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is Indiana Jones,
famous archeologist.</font>

19
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:07,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I thought archeologists
were always funny little men</font>

20
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">searching for their mommies.</font>

21
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:11,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mummies.</font>

22
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:13,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones found Nurhachi for me,</font>

23
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:17,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he's going to deliver him now.</font>

24
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:21,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say, who is this Nurhachi?</font>

25
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:23,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put the gun away, sonny.</font>

26
00:04:27,727 --> 00:04:30,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I suggest you give me what you owe me</font>

27
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or anything goes.</font>

28
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:43,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open it.</font>

29
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The diamond, Lao.</font>

30
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:55,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The deal was for the diamond.</font>

31
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:19,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Lao...</font>

32
00:05:23,908 --> 00:05:25,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To your very good health.</font>

33
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:27,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lao! He put a hole...</font>

34
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:30,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He put two holes
in my dress from Paris!</font>

35
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:32,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sit down!</font>

36
00:05:35,628 --> 00:05:39,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, you bring me Nurhachi.</font>

37
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:42,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My pleasure.</font>

38
00:05:42,093 --> 00:05:44,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who on Earth is this Nurhachi?</font>

39
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here he is.</font>

40
00:05:54,272 --> 00:05:57,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This Nurhachi's a real small guy.</font>

41
00:06:00,445 --> 00:06:03,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Inside are the remains of Nurhachi,</font>

42
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:07,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">first Emperor of Manchu Dynasty.</font>

43
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:10,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome home, old boy.</font>

44
00:06:20,256 --> 00:06:23,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now, you give me the diamond.</font>

45
00:06:24,886 --> 00:06:26,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you trying to develop
a sense of humor,</font>

46
00:06:26,846 --> 00:06:28,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or am I going deaf?</font>

47
00:06:34,145 --> 00:06:35,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that?</font>

48
00:06:36,022 --> 00:06:37,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Antidote.</font>

49
00:06:38,274 --> 00:06:39,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To what?</font>

50
00:06:39,984 --> 00:06:43,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The poison you just drank, Dr. Jones.</font>

51
00:06:47,784 --> 00:06:50,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The poison works fast, Dr. Jones.</font>

52
00:06:59,712 --> 00:07:00,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Lao.
- Lao!</font>

53
00:07:01,506 --> 00:07:04,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You keep the girl. I find another.</font>

54
00:07:08,221 --> 00:07:09,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good service here.</font>

55
00:07:10,056 --> 00:07:11,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not a waiter.</font>

56
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:14,852
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wu Han's an old friend.
Game's not over, Lao.</font>

57
00:07:15,812 --> 00:07:17,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Antidote.</font>

58
00:07:31,953 --> 00:07:33,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy...</font>

59
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:39,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry, Wu Han,
I'll get you out of here.</font>

60
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not this time, Indy.</font>

61
00:07:42,338 --> 00:07:44,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I followed you on many adventures,</font>

62
00:07:45,049 --> 00:07:49,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but into the great unknown mystery,
I go first, Indy.</font>

63
00:07:53,224 --> 00:07:56,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't be sad, Dr. Jones.</font>

64
00:07:56,102 --> 00:07:58,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will soon be joining him.</font>

65
00:08:04,235 --> 00:08:06,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Too much to drink, Dr. Jones?</font>

66
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:00,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, nuts!</font>

67
00:09:10,468 --> 00:09:13,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The antidote.
- Where's the diamond?</font>

68
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

69
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:49,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay there!</font>

70
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:32,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

71
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:36,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to die!</font>

72
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:49,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you?</font>

73
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:55,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow! Holy smoke!</font>

74
00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:57,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Crash landing!</font>

75
00:10:57,867 --> 00:11:00,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Short Round, step on it.</font>

76
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:03,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okeydokey, Dr. Jones.
Hold on to your potatoes.</font>

77
00:11:03,414 --> 00:11:06,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For crying out loud,
there's a kid driving the car!</font>

78
00:11:21,432 --> 00:11:23,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow! Wow.</font>

79
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:28,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's the antidote? Let me have it.</font>

80
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:29,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, I just met you, for Christ's sakes.</font>

81
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:31,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me...</font>

82
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not that kind of girl.</font>

83
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Dr. Jones, no time for love.</font>

84
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:37,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got company.</font>

85
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I hope you choke.</font>

86
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:48,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No shooting.</font>

87
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:06,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, you asked for it.</font>

88
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:28,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is fun!</font>

89
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here, hold this.</font>

90
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:40,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's my gun? Where's my gun?</font>

91
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:42,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I burned my fingers,
and I cracked a nail!</font>

92
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:54,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones... I'm Art Weber.</font>

93
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:56,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I spoke with your assistant.</font>

94
00:12:56,527 --> 00:12:58,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've managed to secure three seats,</font>

95
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:00,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but there might be
a slight inconvenience</font>

96
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:04,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as you will be riding
on a cargo full of live poultry.</font>

97
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:05,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is he kidding?</font>

98
00:13:05,286 --> 00:13:07,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Madam, it's the best I could do
on such short notice.</font>

99
00:13:07,997 --> 00:13:12,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heavens, aren't you Willie Scott,
the famous American female vocalist?</font>

100
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:15,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Owe you a gin.</font>

101
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:26,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice try, Lao Che.</font>

102
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:34,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good-bye, Dr. Jones.</font>

103
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:14,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what are you supposed to be,
a lion tamer?</font>

104
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:17,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm allowing you to tag along,</font>

105
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:20,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so why don't you give
your mouth a rest?</font>

106
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:22,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, doll?</font>

107
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:24,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean, "tag along"?</font>

108
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:26,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ever since you got into my club,</font>

109
00:14:26,534 --> 00:14:28,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you haven't been able
to take your eyes off me.</font>

110
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:30,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah?</font>

111
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no.</font>

112
00:16:08,469 --> 00:16:11,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no! Mister, mister...</font>

113
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, mister, wake up. Please, mister...</font>

114
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:14,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You call him Dr. Jones, doll!</font>

115
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:18,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, Dr. Jones, Dr. Jones.
Oh, wake up, please!</font>

116
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:20,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are we there already? Oh, good.</font>

117
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:21,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

118
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:27,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No one's flying the plane!
- Oh, boy...</font>

119
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:30,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They've all gone!</font>

120
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:36,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know how to fly, don't you?</font>

121
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">NO. Do you?</font>

122
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:39,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no.</font>

123
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:41,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, my God!
- How hard can it be?</font>

124
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:43,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm gonna faint.
- Altimeter! Okay.</font>

125
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:45,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Air speed. Okay.</font>

126
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:46,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuel...</font>

127
00:16:48,092 --> 00:16:49,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuel?</font>

128
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:51,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuel?</font>

129
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:07,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think we got a big problem.</font>

130
00:17:07,236 --> 00:17:08,737
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dr. Jones!
- Shorty!</font>

131
00:17:08,821 --> 00:17:11,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones! No more parachutes!</font>

132
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shorty!</font>

133
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:16,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on, give me a hand!
- What's that?</font>

134
00:17:16,245 --> 00:17:17,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move the box!</font>

135
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:19,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones, you're crazy!</font>

136
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shorty, get our stuff!</font>

137
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:33,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A boat? We're not sinking.</font>

138
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:35,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're crashing!</font>

139
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:38,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grab on, Shorty! Grab on!</font>

140
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:40,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Lady, I can't breathe!
- Tight!</font>

141
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:21,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Slow it down!</font>

142
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:25,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That wasn't so bad, was it?</font>

143
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:41,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put on the brakes!</font>

144
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:48,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hate the water, and I hate being wet,</font>

145
00:18:49,338 --> 00:18:50,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I hate you!</font>

146
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:53,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good. Good!</font>

147
00:19:18,617 --> 00:19:19,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones?</font>

148
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:22,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm all right, Shorty.</font>

149
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:24,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You Okay?</font>

150
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:35,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are we, anyway?</font>

151
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:41,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">India.</font>

152
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do you know that?</font>

153
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:37,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I sure hope this means dinner.</font>

154
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:39,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, I'm starving.</font>

155
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:41,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

156
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:50,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't eat this.</font>

157
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:54,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's more food
than these people eat in a week.</font>

158
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:56,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're starving.</font>

159
00:21:56,775 --> 00:21:58,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I'm sorry. You can have...</font>

160
00:21:58,568 --> 00:21:59,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eat it.</font>

161
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:03,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not hungry.</font>

162
00:22:05,784 --> 00:22:09,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're insulting them,
and you're embarrassing me.</font>

163
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:12,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Eat it.
- Eat it.</font>

164
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:13,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eat.</font>

165
00:22:28,265 --> 00:22:29,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bad news coming.</font>

166
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:34,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you provide us with a guide
to take us to Delhi?</font>

167
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:37,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a professor.
I have to get back to my university.</font>

168
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:39,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. Sajnu will guide you.</font>

169
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:47,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On the way to Delhi,
you will stop at Pankot.</font>

170
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:51,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pankot is not on the way to Delhi.</font>

171
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:53,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will go to Pankot Palace.</font>

172
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:56,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought the palace had been deserted
since the 1850s.</font>

173
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:59,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Now there is a new Maharajah,</font>

174
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:04,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and again the palace
has the power of the Dark Light.</font>

175
00:23:05,469 --> 00:23:08,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is that place kill my people.</font>

176
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:10,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What has happened here?</font>

177
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:12,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The evil start in Pankot,</font>

178
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then like monsoon,</font>

179
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:20,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it moves darkness</font>

180
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">over all country,</font>

181
00:23:26,073 --> 00:23:27,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">over all country.</font>

182
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:29,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The evil?</font>

183
00:23:33,163 --> 00:23:34,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What evil?</font>

184
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:36,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See? Bad news.</font>

185
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:39,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You listen to Suwamu. You leave Lanka.</font>

186
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:44,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They came from palace</font>

187
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:50,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and took Sivalinga from our village.</font>

188
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:52,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Took what?</font>

189
00:23:52,682 --> 00:23:54,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a stone, a sacred stone</font>

190
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:56,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from a shrine that protects the village.</font>

191
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:59,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is why Siva brought you here.</font>

192
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:10,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We weren't brought here.</font>

193
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:13,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our plane crashed.</font>

194
00:24:13,703 --> 00:24:15,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It crashed.</font>

195
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:16,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no.</font>

196
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:22,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We prayed to Siva to help us
find the stone.</font>

197
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:28,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was Siva who made you fall
from the sky.</font>

198
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:35,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you will go to Pankot Palace
to find Sivalinga</font>

199
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:38,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and bring back to us.</font>

200
00:24:39,271 --> 00:24:40,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bring back to us.</font>

201
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:42,983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bring back to us.</font>

202
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:45,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bring back to us.</font>

203
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones, did they make
the plane crash</font>

204
00:24:49,197 --> 00:24:50,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to get you here?</font>

205
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:55,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Shorty, it's just a ghost story.
Don't worry about it.</font>

206
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:01,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They took the stone from here.</font>

207
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:10,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was the stone very smooth
like a rock from a sacred river?</font>

208
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

209
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:13,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With three lines across it</font>

210
00:25:13,889 --> 00:25:15,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">representing the three levels
of the universe.</font>

211
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:17,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's right.
- Yes.</font>

212
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've seen stones like the one you lost.</font>

213
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:24,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But why would Maharajah
take the sacred stone from here?</font>

214
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:27,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They says we must pray
to their evil god.</font>

215
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:31,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We says we will not.</font>

216
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:34,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me, I don't understand
how one rock</font>

217
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:36,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">could destroy a whole village.</font>

218
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:43,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's saying when
the sacred stone was taken,</font>

219
00:25:43,084 --> 00:25:45,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the village wells dried up,
and the river turned to sand.</font>

220
00:25:50,842 --> 00:25:52,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The crops were swallowed by the earth,</font>

221
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:55,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the animals laid down
and turned to dust.</font>

222
00:25:57,057 --> 00:25:59,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then one night
there was a fire in the fields.</font>

223
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:03,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The men went out to fight the fire.</font>

224
00:26:03,104 --> 00:26:06,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When they came back,
the women were crying in the darkness.</font>

225
00:26:17,244 --> 00:26:18,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Children.</font>

226
00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:22,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He says they stole their children.</font>

227
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sankara! Sankara...</font>

228
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:19,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ranjit!</font>

229
00:27:20,765 --> 00:27:22,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ranjit!</font>

230
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:49,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sankara.</font>

231
00:28:05,268 --> 00:28:08,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Little boy escaped from the evil palace.</font>

232
00:28:09,814 --> 00:28:12,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Many other children still there.</font>

233
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:14,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What we do, Dr. Jones?</font>

234
00:28:22,786 --> 00:28:24,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What you think?</font>

235
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:30,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think that somebody believes
the good luck rock from this village</font>

236
00:28:30,502 --> 00:28:32,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is one of the lost Sankara Stones.</font>

237
00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:34,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is Sankara?</font>

238
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:37,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fortune and glory, kid.</font>

239
00:28:39,302 --> 00:28:40,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fortune and glory.</font>

240
00:29:05,161 --> 00:29:08,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Willie, quit monkeying around
on that thing.</font>

241
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:19,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, wait a second! Indy!</font>

242
00:29:19,384 --> 00:29:21,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't go to Delhi like this!</font>

243
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:25,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not going to Delhi, doll.
We're going to Pankot Palace.</font>

244
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:27,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pankot?</font>

245
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:29,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't go to Pankot! I'm a singer.</font>

246
00:29:29,936 --> 00:29:32,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I need to call my agent.
ls there a phone?</font>

247
00:29:32,647 --> 00:29:34,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anybody, I need a phone!</font>

248
00:30:25,158 --> 00:30:28,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, quit complaining.
This is expensive stuff.</font>

249
00:30:29,913 --> 00:30:32,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You come to America with me
and we get job in circus.</font>

250
00:30:32,457 --> 00:30:34,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You like that? You like America?</font>

251
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:36,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're my best friend.</font>

252
00:30:36,753 --> 00:30:38,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're my best friend.</font>

253
00:30:39,923 --> 00:30:41,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What big birds!</font>

254
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:45,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those aren't big birds, sweetheart.</font>

255
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're giant vampire bats.</font>

256
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bats?</font>

257
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:01,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pipe down, you big baboon.
This doesn't hurt.</font>

258
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:04,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what you really need?
You really need a bath.</font>

259
00:31:14,415 --> 00:31:16,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ha-ha, very funny.</font>

260
00:31:17,502 --> 00:31:18,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very funny.</font>

261
00:31:20,004 --> 00:31:21,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very funny.</font>

262
00:31:21,548 --> 00:31:22,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All Wet.</font>

263
00:31:23,883 --> 00:31:26,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was happy in Shanghai.</font>

264
00:31:27,637 --> 00:31:30,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had a little house and a garden.</font>

265
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:33,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My friends were rich.</font>

266
00:31:33,268 --> 00:31:35,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We went to parties
all the time in limousines.</font>

267
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:37,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hate being outside!</font>

268
00:31:40,775 --> 00:31:43,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a singer! I could lose my voice!</font>

269
00:31:46,531 --> 00:31:48,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think we'll camp here tonight.</font>

270
00:31:50,702 --> 00:31:52,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cut it out.</font>

271
00:31:58,209 --> 00:32:00,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What do you got?
- Two sixes.</font>

272
00:32:00,295 --> 00:32:02,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aha-ha, three aces. I win.</font>

273
00:32:03,047 --> 00:32:05,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two more game, I have all your money.</font>

274
00:32:07,844 --> 00:32:10,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's poker, Shorty, anything can happen.</font>

275
00:32:11,097 --> 00:32:13,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where did you find
your little bodyguard?</font>

276
00:32:13,683 --> 00:32:16,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't find him, I caught him.</font>

277
00:32:16,144 --> 00:32:17,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

278
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:20,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shorty's family were killed
when the Japanese bombed Shanghai.</font>

279
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:22,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's been living on the streets
since he was 4.</font>

280
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:26,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I caught him trying to pick my pocket,
didn't I, short stuff?</font>

281
00:32:29,866 --> 00:32:32,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Biggest trouble with her is the noise.</font>

282
00:32:40,043 --> 00:32:43,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! You cheat, Dr. Jones. You cheat!</font>

283
00:32:43,212 --> 00:32:44,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What do you mean?
- You take four card.</font>

284
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You pay now.
- Oh, they were stuck together.</font>

285
00:32:48,718 --> 00:32:50,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No stuck. No mistake.
- They were stuck together.</font>

286
00:32:50,094 --> 00:32:51,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a mistake.</font>

287
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm very little. You cheat very big.</font>

288
00:32:54,557 --> 00:32:56,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones, you cheat!</font>

289
00:32:56,434 --> 00:32:58,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You pay money. You owe me 10 cent.</font>

290
00:32:59,103 --> 00:33:00,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at this. Look at this.</font>

291
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:06,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You accuse me of cheating.
You're cheating.</font>

292
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:14,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You make me poor. No fun.</font>

293
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:16,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Play with you no fun.</font>

294
00:33:16,746 --> 00:33:19,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I quit.
- I quit, too.</font>

295
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:21,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This place is completely surrounded.</font>

296
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:24,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The entire place is crawling
with living things.</font>

297
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:26,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why they call it
the jungle, sweetheart</font>

298
00:33:26,589 --> 00:33:28,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God, what else is out there?</font>

299
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:29,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Willie, wait...</font>

300
00:33:34,931 --> 00:33:36,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Willie, Willie...</font>

301
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:39,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that?
Is that short for something?</font>

302
00:33:39,936 --> 00:33:43,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Willie" is my professional name,
Indiana.</font>

303
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:46,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, lady, you call him Dr. Jones.</font>

304
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:48,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My professional name.</font>

305
00:33:50,405 --> 00:33:52,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you dragging us off
to this deserted palace?</font>

306
00:33:52,949 --> 00:33:54,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fortune and glory?</font>

307
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:56,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fortune and glory.</font>

308
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well...</font>

309
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:01,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this is a piece of an old manuscript.</font>

310
00:34:03,126 --> 00:34:05,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This pictograph represents Sankara,
a priest.</font>

311
00:34:05,962 --> 00:34:07,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Scram.</font>

312
00:34:08,214 --> 00:34:11,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gentle. Gentle.
This is hundreds of years old.</font>

313
00:34:11,092 --> 00:34:12,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that some kind of writing?</font>

314
00:34:12,552 --> 00:34:14,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, it's Sanskrit.</font>

315
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cut it out.</font>

316
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:17,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's part of the legend of Sankara.</font>

317
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:20,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He climbs Mount Kalisa
where he meets Siva,</font>

318
00:34:20,268 --> 00:34:21,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the Hindu god.</font>

319
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:24,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's Siva?
And what's he handing the priest?</font>

320
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Rocks.
- Stop.</font>

321
00:34:28,192 --> 00:34:30,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He told him to go forth and combat evil.</font>

322
00:34:30,778 --> 00:34:33,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And to help him,
he gave him five sacred stones</font>

323
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with magical properties.</font>

324
00:34:35,074 --> 00:34:36,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Magic rocks?</font>

325
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:38,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My grandpa was a magician.</font>

326
00:34:38,161 --> 00:34:40,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He spent his entire life
with a rabbit in his pocket</font>

327
00:34:40,538 --> 00:34:41,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and pigeons up his sleeves.</font>

328
00:34:41,622 --> 00:34:44,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He made a lot of children happy
and died a very poor man.</font>

329
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:48,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Magic rocks. Fortune and glory.</font>

330
00:34:48,171 --> 00:34:50,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sweet dreams, Dr. Jones.</font>

331
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are you going?</font>

332
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd sleep closer, if I were you.</font>

333
00:34:56,012 --> 00:34:57,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For safety's sake.</font>

334
00:34:58,055 --> 00:35:01,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones, I'd be safer
sleeping with a snake.</font>

335
00:35:03,311 --> 00:35:05,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said, cut it out!</font>

336
00:35:09,984 --> 00:35:11,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hate that elephant.</font>

337
00:35:40,264 --> 00:35:41,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy, look!</font>

338
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:46,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see it, Shorty. That's it. Pankot Palace.</font>

339
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:07,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones, what you look at?</font>

340
00:37:08,436 --> 00:37:10,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't come up here.</font>

341
00:37:15,818 --> 00:37:18,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! No, no, no, no! Don't leave! No!</font>

342
00:37:18,487 --> 00:37:21,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No,no,no,no,no!</font>

343
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, baby elephant, stay here!</font>

344
00:37:23,326 --> 00:37:25,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no! Indy!</font>

345
00:37:25,494 --> 00:37:27,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're stealing our rides!</font>

346
00:37:28,164 --> 00:37:29,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We walk from here.</font>

347
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:07,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello.</font>

348
00:38:08,162 --> 00:38:10,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should say you look rather lost.</font>

349
00:38:11,707 --> 00:38:13,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But then I cannot imagine
where in the world</font>

350
00:38:13,918 --> 00:38:15,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the three of you would look at home.</font>

351
00:38:16,045 --> 00:38:18,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not lost.
We're on our way to Delhi.</font>

352
00:38:18,881 --> 00:38:20,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is Miss Scott.</font>

353
00:38:20,841 --> 00:38:22,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is Mr. Round.</font>

354
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Short Round.</font>

355
00:38:24,053 --> 00:38:25,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My name is Indiana Jones.</font>

356
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:29,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones, the eminent archeologist?</font>

357
00:38:29,517 --> 00:38:31,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hard to believe, isn't it?</font>

358
00:38:32,228 --> 00:38:35,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I remember first hearing your name
when I was up at Oxford.</font>

359
00:38:36,482 --> 00:38:39,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Chattar Lal,
Prime Minister to His Highness,</font>

360
00:38:39,235 --> 00:38:41,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the Maharajah of Pankot.</font>

361
00:38:41,988 --> 00:38:43,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm enchanted.</font>

362
00:38:43,572 --> 00:38:46,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Enchanted. Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.</font>

363
00:38:46,409 --> 00:38:48,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome to Pankot Palace!</font>

364
00:38:51,914 --> 00:38:53,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Enchanted, huh?</font>

365
00:39:05,011 --> 00:39:07,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shorty, where's my razor?</font>

366
00:39:32,038 --> 00:39:36,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are fortunate tonight
to have so many unexpected visitors.</font>

367
00:39:36,751 --> 00:39:38,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This is Captain...
- ...Blumburtt.</font>

368
00:39:38,586 --> 00:39:40,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">11th Poona Rifles.</font>

369
00:39:40,129 --> 00:39:43,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you, sir, are Dr. Jones, I presume.</font>

370
00:39:43,466 --> 00:39:44,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am, Captain.</font>

371
00:39:44,675 --> 00:39:48,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain Blumburtt and his troops
are on a routine inspection tour.</font>

372
00:39:48,804 --> 00:39:52,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The British find it amusing
to inspect us at their convenience.</font>

373
00:39:52,433 --> 00:39:56,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do hope, sir, that it's not
inconvenient to you, sir.</font>

374
00:39:57,813 --> 00:40:00,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The British worry so about their empire.</font>

375
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:03,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Makes us all feel like
well-cared-for children.</font>

376
00:40:13,996 --> 00:40:16,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look beautiful.</font>

377
00:40:16,957 --> 00:40:19,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think the Maharajah
is swimming in loot.</font>

378
00:40:19,293 --> 00:40:22,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe it wasn't such a bad idea
coming here after all.</font>

379
00:40:23,214 --> 00:40:25,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look like a princess.</font>

380
00:40:25,549 --> 00:40:29,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Lal, what do they call
the Maharajah's wife?</font>

381
00:40:29,595 --> 00:40:32,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His Highness has not yet taken a wife.</font>

382
00:40:32,264 --> 00:40:33,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How interesting.</font>

383
00:40:33,432 --> 00:40:36,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, maybe it's because
he hasn't found the right woman.</font>

384
00:40:50,324 --> 00:40:52,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His Supreme Highness,</font>

385
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:55,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">guardian of Pankot tradition,</font>

386
00:40:57,498 --> 00:40:59,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the Maharajah of Pankot,</font>

387
00:41:00,793 --> 00:41:02,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Zalim Singh.</font>

388
00:41:24,692 --> 00:41:26,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the Maharajah?</font>

389
00:41:27,027 --> 00:41:28,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A kid?</font>

390
00:41:30,865 --> 00:41:33,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe he like older women.</font>

391
00:41:42,001 --> 00:41:43,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain Blumburtt was just telling me</font>

392
00:41:43,711 --> 00:41:46,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">something of the interesting
history of the palace,</font>

393
00:41:46,255 --> 00:41:48,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the importance it played in the mutiny.</font>

394
00:41:48,966 --> 00:41:53,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It seems the British never forget
the Mutiny of 1857.</font>

395
00:41:54,597 --> 00:41:56,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, well, you know, I think
there are other events,</font>

396
00:41:56,765 --> 00:41:58,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">before the mutiny, going back a century,</font>

397
00:41:59,059 --> 00:42:01,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">back to the time of Clive,
that are more interesting.</font>

398
00:42:02,104 --> 00:42:04,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what events are those, Dr. Jones?</font>

399
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, if memory serves me correctly,
this area, this province,</font>

400
00:42:07,776 --> 00:42:10,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">was the center of activity
for the Thuggee.</font>

401
00:42:13,032 --> 00:42:15,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Snake... Surprise.</font>

402
00:42:16,243 --> 00:42:17,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the surprise?</font>

403
00:42:27,379 --> 00:42:30,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones, you know perfectly well</font>

404
00:42:30,466 --> 00:42:32,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the Thuggee cult has been dead
for nearly a century.</font>

405
00:42:33,052 --> 00:42:34,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, of course.</font>

406
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:37,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Thuggee was an obscenity</font>

407
00:42:37,473 --> 00:42:40,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that worshipped Kali
with human sacrifices.</font>

408
00:42:41,227 --> 00:42:43,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The British Army
nicely did away with them.</font>

409
00:42:46,649 --> 00:42:49,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I suppose stories
of the Thuggee die hard.</font>

410
00:42:50,069 --> 00:42:52,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are no stories any more.</font>

411
00:42:53,072 --> 00:42:54,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not so sure.</font>

412
00:42:55,324 --> 00:42:57,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We came from a small village.</font>

413
00:42:57,493 --> 00:42:58,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The peasants there told us</font>

414
00:42:58,744 --> 00:43:01,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pankot Palace was growing
powerful again</font>

415
00:43:01,163 --> 00:43:03,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because of some ancient evil.</font>

416
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:05,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Village stories, Dr. Jones.</font>

417
00:43:05,668 --> 00:43:08,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're just fear and folklore.</font>

418
00:43:10,297 --> 00:43:13,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're beginning to worry
Captain Blumburtt.</font>

419
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:19,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not worried, Mr. Prime Minister,
just interested.</font>

420
00:43:34,947 --> 00:43:37,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? You are not eating?</font>

421
00:43:39,743 --> 00:43:41,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had bugs for lunch.</font>

422
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:46,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me your hat.</font>

423
00:43:48,377 --> 00:43:49,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>

424
00:43:49,795 --> 00:43:51,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause I'm gonna puke in it.</font>

425
00:43:54,091 --> 00:43:58,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, the villagers also told us
Pankot Palace had taken something.</font>

426
00:43:58,554 --> 00:44:01,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones, in our country,</font>

427
00:44:01,348 --> 00:44:04,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's not usual for a guest
to insult his host.</font>

428
00:44:05,644 --> 00:44:07,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

429
00:44:07,896 --> 00:44:09,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought we were talking about folklore.</font>

430
00:44:10,357 --> 00:44:14,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me, sir,
do you have anything simple, like soup?</font>

431
00:44:15,654 --> 00:44:18,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What exactly was it
they say was stolen?</font>

432
00:44:19,992 --> 00:44:21,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A sacred rock.</font>

433
00:44:24,496 --> 00:44:26,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see, Captain, a rock!</font>

434
00:44:42,097 --> 00:44:45,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something connected the villagers' rock</font>

435
00:44:46,435 --> 00:44:49,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the old legend
of the Sankara Stones.</font>

436
00:44:49,188 --> 00:44:53,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable
to vicious rumors.</font>

437
00:44:53,859 --> 00:44:56,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I seem to remember that in Honduras</font>

438
00:44:56,195 --> 00:44:58,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you were accused of being
a grave robber</font>

439
00:44:58,322 --> 00:45:00,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">rather than an archeologist.</font>

440
00:45:00,115 --> 00:45:03,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, the newspapers greatly
exaggerated the incident.</font>

441
00:45:03,535 --> 00:45:06,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And wasn't it the Sultan of Madagascar
who threatened to cut your head off</font>

442
00:45:06,872 --> 00:45:08,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if you ever returned to his country?</font>

443
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:09,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it wasn't my head.</font>

444
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:10,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then your hands, perhaps.</font>

445
00:45:10,793 --> 00:45:12,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it wasn't my hands,</font>

446
00:45:12,878 --> 00:45:13,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it was my...</font>

447
00:45:15,339 --> 00:45:16,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My misunderstanding.</font>

448
00:45:16,715 --> 00:45:19,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Exactly what we have here, Dr. Jones.</font>

449
00:45:19,093 --> 00:45:22,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have heard the evil stories
of the Thuggee cult.</font>

450
00:45:23,222 --> 00:45:26,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought the stories were told
to frighten children.</font>

451
00:45:26,934 --> 00:45:30,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Later, I learnt
the Thuggee cult was once real</font>

452
00:45:30,145 --> 00:45:32,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and did of unspeakable things.</font>

453
00:45:32,981 --> 00:45:36,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am ashamed of what happened here
so many years ago,</font>

454
00:45:36,652 --> 00:45:37,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I assure you</font>

455
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:42,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this will never happen again
in my kingdom.</font>

456
00:45:42,991 --> 00:45:44,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I offended you,</font>

457
00:45:46,161 --> 00:45:47,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then I am sorry.</font>

458
00:45:58,632 --> 00:46:00,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dessert!</font>

459
00:46:13,188 --> 00:46:15,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chilled monkey brains.</font>

460
00:46:30,956 --> 00:46:32,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I'll just check on Willie.</font>

461
00:46:34,501 --> 00:46:36,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's all you better do.</font>

462
00:46:38,589 --> 00:46:40,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me later what happened</font>

463
00:46:40,799 --> 00:46:42,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Am-scray.</font>

464
00:46:53,395 --> 00:46:55,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got something for you.</font>

465
00:46:55,564 --> 00:46:59,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's nothing you have
that I could possibly want.</font>

466
00:46:59,485 --> 00:47:00,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

467
00:47:13,874 --> 00:47:15,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a very nice man.</font>

468
00:47:15,876 --> 00:47:18,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe you could be my palace slave.</font>

469
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:30,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wear your jewels to bed, Princess?</font>

470
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

471
00:47:34,853 --> 00:47:36,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And nothing else.</font>

472
00:47:36,939 --> 00:47:38,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That shock you?</font>

473
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:39,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing shocks me.</font>

474
00:47:40,609 --> 00:47:42,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a scientist.</font>

475
00:47:43,695 --> 00:47:46,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, as a scientist,
you do a lot of research?</font>

476
00:47:47,533 --> 00:47:48,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Always.</font>

477
00:47:49,159 --> 00:47:51,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what sort of research
would you do on me?</font>

478
00:47:55,082 --> 00:47:56,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nocturnal activities.</font>

479
00:47:56,542 --> 00:47:59,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You mean like what sort of cream
I put on my face at night,</font>

480
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:01,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what position I like to sleep in?</font>

481
00:48:01,547 --> 00:48:02,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mating customs.</font>

482
00:48:02,965 --> 00:48:04,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Love rituals?</font>

483
00:48:04,299 --> 00:48:07,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Primitive sexual practices.</font>

484
00:48:07,094 --> 00:48:08,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you're an authority in that area?</font>

485
00:48:09,137 --> 00:48:10,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Years of fieldwork.</font>

486
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:22,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't blame you for being sore at me.</font>

487
00:48:22,985 --> 00:48:25,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can be hard to handle.</font>

488
00:48:26,321 --> 00:48:28,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've had worse.</font>

489
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you'll never have better.</font>

490
00:48:33,912 --> 00:48:35,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

491
00:48:35,706 --> 00:48:37,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As a scientist,
I don't want to prejudice my experiment.</font>

492
00:48:38,041 --> 00:48:39,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll let you know in the morning.</font>

493
00:48:40,794 --> 00:48:43,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why, you conceited ape.</font>

494
00:48:43,463 --> 00:48:45,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not that easy.</font>

495
00:48:47,384 --> 00:48:49,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not that easy, either.</font>

496
00:48:50,012 --> 00:48:51,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trouble with you is, Willie,</font>

497
00:48:51,638 --> 00:48:53,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're too used to getting your own way.</font>

498
00:48:54,683 --> 00:48:55,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you're just too proud to admit</font>

499
00:48:56,018 --> 00:48:59,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones.</font>

500
00:48:59,688 --> 00:49:02,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you want me, Willie,
you know where you can find me.</font>

501
00:49:03,317 --> 00:49:04,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">5 minutes.</font>

502
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:06,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll be back over here in 5 minutes.</font>

503
00:49:06,945 --> 00:49:08,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be asleep in 5 minutes.</font>

504
00:49:08,572 --> 00:49:09,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">5.</font>

505
00:49:09,865 --> 00:49:12,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know it, and I know it.</font>

506
00:49:26,882 --> 00:49:28,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">5 minutes.</font>

507
00:49:31,053 --> 00:49:33,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">4 and a half.</font>

508
00:50:26,858 --> 00:50:29,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Palace slave."</font>

509
00:50:29,486 --> 00:50:31,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Nocturnal activities."</font>

510
00:50:33,407 --> 00:50:35,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a "conceited ape"?</font>

511
00:50:36,034 --> 00:50:37,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"I'll tell you in the morning."</font>

512
00:50:39,329 --> 00:50:40,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't believe it.</font>

513
00:50:41,373 --> 00:50:42,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's not coming.</font>

514
00:50:43,083 --> 00:50:44,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's not coming.</font>

515
00:50:47,045 --> 00:50:48,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't believe I'm not going.</font>

516
00:51:08,775 --> 00:51:10,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indiana Jones!</font>

517
00:51:10,402 --> 00:51:13,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is one night you'll never forget!</font>

518
00:51:13,155 --> 00:51:16,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the night
I slipped right through your fingers!</font>

519
00:51:18,368 --> 00:51:19,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sleep tight,</font>

520
00:51:19,703 --> 00:51:21,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and pleasant dreams!</font>

521
00:51:24,332 --> 00:51:26,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could have been
your greatest adventure.</font>

522
00:51:37,554 --> 00:51:38,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones, your whip!</font>

523
00:52:00,202 --> 00:52:01,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shorty,</font>

524
00:52:01,369 --> 00:52:02,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">turn off the switch.</font>

525
00:52:09,002 --> 00:52:10,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy.</font>

526
00:52:11,505 --> 00:52:14,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be gentle with me.</font>

527
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:22,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm here.</font>

528
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:34,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's nobody here.</font>

529
00:52:35,237 --> 00:52:37,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm here.</font>

530
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy, you're acting awfully strange.</font>

531
00:53:06,935 --> 00:53:09,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I'm right here.</font>

532
00:53:21,992 --> 00:53:26,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Follow in the footsteps of Siva."</font>

533
00:53:26,454 --> 00:53:28,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What does that mean?</font>

534
00:53:31,376 --> 00:53:34,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Do not betray these truths."</font>

535
00:53:34,713 --> 00:53:37,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shorty, go get our stuff.</font>

536
00:54:06,328 --> 00:54:08,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay behind me, Short Round.</font>

537
00:54:09,456 --> 00:54:13,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Step where I step,
and don't touch anything.</font>

538
00:54:25,597 --> 00:54:27,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I step where you step.</font>

539
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:29,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I touch nothing.</font>

540
00:54:30,352 --> 00:54:32,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy!</font>

541
00:54:52,999 --> 00:54:54,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I step on something.</font>

542
00:54:55,961 --> 00:54:58,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, there's something on the ground.</font>

543
00:54:58,296 --> 00:55:00,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Feel like step on fortune cookies.</font>

544
00:55:01,841 --> 00:55:04,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not fortune cookies.</font>

545
00:55:06,096 --> 00:55:08,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me take a look.</font>

546
00:55:21,611 --> 00:55:23,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's no cookies.</font>

547
00:55:23,947 --> 00:55:25,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all right. I got him.</font>

548
00:55:29,077 --> 00:55:31,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go. There, go.</font>

549
00:56:10,994 --> 00:56:12,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop.</font>

550
00:56:12,162 --> 00:56:15,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, just stand up against the wall,
will you?</font>

551
00:56:30,388 --> 00:56:32,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You say to stand against the wall!</font>

552
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:33,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I listen to what you say!</font>

553
00:56:34,059 --> 00:56:36,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Not my fault! Not my fault!
- Willie, get down here!</font>

554
00:56:36,227 --> 00:56:38,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're in trouble!</font>

555
00:56:38,354 --> 00:56:41,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Willie! Willie!</font>

556
00:56:41,149 --> 00:56:43,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bet I get all dirty again.</font>

557
00:56:44,194 --> 00:56:45,737
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Willie, get down here!
- Not my fault!</font>

558
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:46,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're in trouble!</font>

559
00:56:47,405 --> 00:56:50,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trouble? Trouble? What sort of...</font>

560
00:57:05,715 --> 00:57:07,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is serious!</font>

561
00:57:07,509 --> 00:57:10,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are two dead people down here!</font>

562
00:57:11,054 --> 00:57:14,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There're going to be
two dead people in here! Hurry!</font>

563
00:57:14,349 --> 00:57:16,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've almost had enough of you two.</font>

564
00:57:16,684 --> 00:57:17,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Willie!</font>

565
00:57:17,852 --> 00:57:19,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the rush?</font>

566
00:57:19,729 --> 00:57:22,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a long story, Willie.
Hurry, or you don't get to hear it.</font>

567
00:57:24,901 --> 00:57:27,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, what is this?</font>

568
00:57:29,531 --> 00:57:31,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy, what is this?</font>

569
00:57:31,241 --> 00:57:33,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't see a thing!</font>

570
00:57:34,369 --> 00:57:35,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hurry!</font>

571
00:57:35,537 --> 00:57:37,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right!</font>

572
00:57:37,539 --> 00:57:38,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I broke a nail.</font>

573
00:57:53,263 --> 00:57:54,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Willie, hurry!</font>

574
00:57:54,889 --> 00:57:56,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're in my hair!</font>

575
00:57:56,975 --> 00:57:58,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut up, Willie!</font>

576
00:58:00,019 --> 00:58:02,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Indy, let me in!
- No, let us out!</font>

577
00:58:02,605 --> 00:58:04,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let me in!
- Let us out!</font>

578
00:58:04,732 --> 00:58:06,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Shut up!
- I'm down here!</font>

579
00:58:06,526 --> 00:58:07,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're all over me!</font>

580
00:58:08,653 --> 00:58:11,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's got to be
a fulcrum release lever somewhere.</font>

581
00:58:11,406 --> 00:58:12,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

582
00:58:12,574 --> 00:58:14,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A handle that opens the door.</font>

583
00:58:14,617 --> 00:58:16,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Go on!
- They're just, just square holes!</font>

584
00:58:16,411 --> 00:58:17,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go to the right hole.</font>

585
00:58:19,247 --> 00:58:20,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hurry, Willie!</font>

586
00:58:27,589 --> 00:58:30,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The other one! The other right.
Your other right!</font>

587
00:58:30,675 --> 00:58:33,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The one on your right!
- There's slime inside!</font>

588
00:58:33,678 --> 00:58:35,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't do it.</font>

589
00:58:35,388 --> 00:58:37,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can do it. Feel inside.</font>

590
00:58:37,473 --> 00:58:38,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

591
00:58:42,103 --> 00:58:43,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You feel inside!</font>

592
00:58:43,938 --> 00:58:45,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do it now!</font>

593
00:58:45,315 --> 00:58:46,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay!</font>

594
00:58:55,867 --> 00:59:00,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Willie, we are going to die!</font>

595
00:59:01,789 --> 00:59:03,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's soft.</font>

596
00:59:06,127 --> 00:59:07,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's moving!</font>

597
00:59:15,553 --> 00:59:16,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got it!</font>

598
00:59:31,319 --> 00:59:33,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get 'em off of me! Get 'em off of me!</font>

599
00:59:33,446 --> 00:59:36,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're all over me! Get 'em off me!</font>

600
00:59:38,826 --> 00:59:40,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

601
00:59:42,247 --> 00:59:44,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It wasn't me! It's her!</font>

602
00:59:46,084 --> 00:59:47,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>

603
00:59:47,335 --> 00:59:50,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go! Move! Come on, move! Come on!</font>

604
01:00:51,399 --> 01:00:53,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a Thuggee ceremony.</font>

605
01:00:53,568 --> 01:00:55,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're worshipping Kali.</font>

606
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:07,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you ever seen anything
like this before?</font>

607
01:01:07,373 --> 01:01:09,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nobody's seen this for a hundred years.</font>

608
01:02:44,679 --> 01:02:49,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kali Ma. Kali Ma...</font>

609
01:02:50,309 --> 01:02:51,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kali Ma!</font>

610
01:03:28,681 --> 01:03:30,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's still alive.</font>

611
01:04:54,809 --> 01:04:56,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kali Ma.</font>

612
01:05:57,955 --> 01:06:01,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the rock
they took from the village.</font>

613
01:06:01,208 --> 01:06:03,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's one of the Sankara Stones.</font>

614
01:06:10,968 --> 01:06:12,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why they glow like that?</font>

615
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:16,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The legend says</font>

616
01:06:16,599 --> 01:06:17,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when the rocks are brought together,</font>

617
01:06:17,933 --> 01:06:20,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the diamonds inside them will glow.</font>

618
01:06:20,978 --> 01:06:22,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Diamonds?</font>

619
01:06:22,104 --> 01:06:23,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Diamonds.</font>

620
01:06:23,272 --> 01:06:24,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Diamonds!</font>

621
01:06:24,565 --> 01:06:25,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Diamonds.</font>

622
01:06:42,708 --> 01:06:44,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, hey.</font>

623
01:06:44,085 --> 01:06:47,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I want you two
to stay up here and keep quiet.</font>

624
01:06:47,922 --> 01:06:49,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shorty, you keep an eye on her.</font>

625
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:51,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Why, where are you going?
- Down there.</font>

626
01:06:51,133 --> 01:06:54,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Down there? Are you crazy?</font>

627
01:06:54,261 --> 01:06:57,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not leaving here without the stones.</font>

628
01:06:57,473 --> 01:07:00,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You could get killed chasing after
your damn fortune and glory!</font>

629
01:07:00,768 --> 01:07:01,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe.</font>

630
01:07:03,354 --> 01:07:05,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But not today.</font>

631
01:08:20,473 --> 01:08:22,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be careful.</font>

632
01:09:32,086 --> 01:09:33,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's he going?</font>

633
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:38,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me go!</font>

634
01:09:41,428 --> 01:09:43,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run, Willie! Run!</font>

635
01:11:17,691 --> 01:11:19,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones!</font>

636
01:11:21,570 --> 01:11:22,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I keep telling you,</font>

637
01:11:23,030 --> 01:11:26,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you listen me more, you live longer.</font>

638
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:28,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, let me die.</font>

639
01:11:30,329 --> 01:11:31,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I pray to Siva,</font>

640
01:11:32,164 --> 01:11:35,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Let me die," but I do not.</font>

641
01:11:35,876 --> 01:11:38,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now... Now the evil of Kali take me.</font>

642
01:11:40,422 --> 01:11:41,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How?</font>

643
01:11:41,674 --> 01:11:44,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They will make me drink
the blood of the Kali.</font>

644
01:11:44,551 --> 01:11:47,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I'll fall into
the Black Sleep of the Kali Ma.</font>

645
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:49,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that?</font>

646
01:11:50,432 --> 01:11:51,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We become like them.</font>

647
01:11:54,311 --> 01:11:58,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll be alive, but like a nightmare.</font>

648
01:11:58,190 --> 01:12:01,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You drink blood,
you not wake up from nightmare.</font>

649
01:12:13,539 --> 01:12:17,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were caught trying to steal
the Sankara Stones.</font>

650
01:12:18,252 --> 01:12:20,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There were five stones in the beginning.</font>

651
01:12:21,422 --> 01:12:24,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Over the centuries,
they were dispersed by wars,</font>

652
01:12:24,425 --> 01:12:26,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">sold off by thieves like you.</font>

653
01:12:26,635 --> 01:12:28,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thieves like me, huh?</font>

654
01:12:29,930 --> 01:12:32,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Still missing two.</font>

655
01:12:33,017 --> 01:12:35,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A century ago,
when the British raided this temple</font>

656
01:12:35,352 --> 01:12:37,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and butchered my people,</font>

657
01:12:37,312 --> 01:12:41,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a loyal priest hid the last two stones
down here in the catacombs.</font>

658
01:12:41,775 --> 01:12:44,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So that's what you've got
these slaves digging for, huh?</font>

659
01:12:45,529 --> 01:12:46,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're innocent children.</font>

660
01:12:46,947 --> 01:12:49,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They dig for the gems
to support our cause.</font>

661
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:53,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They also search
for the last two stones.</font>

662
01:12:56,290 --> 01:12:59,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Soon we will have
all the five Sankara Stones,</font>

663
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:02,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the Thuggees will be all powerful.</font>

664
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:06,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a vivid imagination.</font>

665
01:13:11,138 --> 01:13:14,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't believe me?</font>

666
01:13:15,601 --> 01:13:18,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will, Dr. Jones.</font>

667
01:13:20,147 --> 01:13:24,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will become a true believer.</font>

668
01:13:42,002 --> 01:13:43,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

669
01:14:07,861 --> 01:14:09,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones!</font>

670
01:14:09,196 --> 01:14:10,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't drink, it's bad!</font>

671
01:14:10,739 --> 01:14:12,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't drink!</font>

672
01:14:12,825 --> 01:14:14,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Spit it out!</font>

673
01:14:48,152 --> 01:14:49,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones...</font>

674
01:15:07,754 --> 01:15:11,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You dare not do that.</font>

675
01:15:29,735 --> 01:15:31,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leave him alone, you bastards!</font>

676
01:15:42,331 --> 01:15:44,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The British in India will be slaughtered.</font>

677
01:15:44,625 --> 01:15:46,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then we will overrun the Muslims.</font>

678
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then the Hebrew God will fall.</font>

679
01:15:50,505 --> 01:15:53,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then the Christian God
will be cast down and forgotten.</font>

680
01:15:55,969 --> 01:15:59,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Soon, Kali Ma will rule the world.</font>

681
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones...</font>

682
01:17:50,876 --> 01:17:53,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kali Ma protects us.</font>

683
01:17:53,837 --> 01:17:56,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are her children.</font>

684
01:17:57,215 --> 01:17:59,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We pledge our devotion to her</font>

685
01:17:59,426 --> 01:18:01,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with an offering of flesh...</font>

686
01:18:01,428 --> 01:18:03,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

687
01:18:06,099 --> 01:18:08,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...And blood.</font>

688
01:18:17,277 --> 01:18:21,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your friend has seen,
and she has heard.</font>

689
01:18:22,741 --> 01:18:25,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now she will not talk.</font>

690
01:18:34,961 --> 01:18:36,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not going to have
anything nice to say</font>

691
01:18:36,838 --> 01:18:38,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about this place when I get back.</font>

692
01:18:39,007 --> 01:18:42,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy! For God sakes, help me!</font>

693
01:18:42,469 --> 01:18:44,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the matter with you?</font>

694
01:18:59,820 --> 01:19:02,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no.</font>

695
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come.</font>

696
01:19:37,649 --> 01:19:39,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come.</font>

697
01:20:01,673 --> 01:20:03,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indiana...</font>

698
01:20:05,051 --> 01:20:08,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indiana, help us.</font>

699
01:20:22,194 --> 01:20:24,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, snap out of it.</font>

700
01:20:25,739 --> 01:20:28,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not one of them.</font>

701
01:20:30,285 --> 01:20:32,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not one of them.</font>

702
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:37,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please come back to us.</font>

703
01:20:38,418 --> 01:20:40,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't leave me.</font>

704
01:20:53,433 --> 01:20:56,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

705
01:20:58,730 --> 01:21:00,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

706
01:21:01,024 --> 01:21:02,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you mad?</font>

707
01:22:19,394 --> 01:22:22,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This can't be happening,
this can't be happening.</font>

708
01:22:22,647 --> 01:22:25,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wake up, Willie, wake up.</font>

709
01:22:56,848 --> 01:22:59,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! No! No!</font>

710
01:23:11,738 --> 01:23:13,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no!</font>

711
01:23:14,366 --> 01:23:16,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wake up, Dr. Jones, wake up!</font>

712
01:23:20,914 --> 01:23:22,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Jones!</font>

713
01:23:38,264 --> 01:23:39,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy, I love you.</font>

714
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:43,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wake up, Indy! Wake up!</font>

715
01:23:45,939 --> 01:23:49,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're my best friend! Wake up, Indy!</font>

716
01:23:54,322 --> 01:23:56,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait! Wait!</font>

717
01:23:57,117 --> 01:23:58,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's mine!</font>

718
01:24:02,205 --> 01:24:04,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm all right, kid.</font>

719
01:24:49,002 --> 01:24:50,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mola Ram!</font>

720
01:26:12,252 --> 01:26:14,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me some slack!</font>

721
01:26:33,231 --> 01:26:35,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Willie, Willie, wake up!</font>

722
01:26:37,986 --> 01:26:40,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Willie, Willie, it's me! I'm back!</font>

723
01:26:43,241 --> 01:26:45,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy.</font>

724
01:27:12,937 --> 01:27:15,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy, my friend.</font>

725
01:27:16,190 --> 01:27:18,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, kid.</font>

726
01:27:24,866 --> 01:27:27,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy, now, let's get out of here.</font>

727
01:27:30,580 --> 01:27:32,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. All of us.</font>

728
01:28:46,531 --> 01:28:48,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

729
01:29:04,632 --> 01:29:05,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got to save him!</font>

730
01:29:05,842 --> 01:29:08,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He can take care of himself.
- He needs me.</font>

731
01:29:10,805 --> 01:29:12,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got to save Indy!</font>

732
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:26,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, save him.</font>

733
01:29:30,450 --> 01:29:31,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drop him down!</font>

734
01:29:31,951 --> 01:29:34,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I kill you! Drop him down!</font>

735
01:30:05,443 --> 01:30:06,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the matter with him?</font>

736
01:30:50,279 --> 01:30:52,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here. Try this.</font>

737
01:32:07,190 --> 01:32:09,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, Indy!</font>

738
01:33:11,295 --> 01:33:13,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was the Black Sleep of Kali.</font>

739
01:33:26,852 --> 01:33:28,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Short Round!</font>

740
01:33:29,230 --> 01:33:32,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quit fooling around with that kid!
Get down in the cart, now!</font>

741
01:33:32,733 --> 01:33:33,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okeydokey, Indy!</font>

742
01:33:34,485 --> 01:33:37,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please listen.
To get out, you must take the left tunnel.</font>

743
01:33:37,697 --> 01:33:39,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

744
01:34:26,871 --> 01:34:28,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shorty! Quit stalling!</font>

745
01:34:29,498 --> 01:34:30,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Indy!</font>

746
01:34:30,833 --> 01:34:31,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go!</font>

747
01:34:32,251 --> 01:34:33,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go! Go!</font>

748
01:34:36,881 --> 01:34:38,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shorty, look out!</font>

749
01:34:46,307 --> 01:34:47,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on!
- Indy!</font>

750
01:34:53,814 --> 01:34:54,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hurry!</font>

751
01:35:00,112 --> 01:35:02,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hurry! Hurry up!</font>

752
01:35:07,661 --> 01:35:11,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy, take the left tunnel! The left tunnel!</font>

753
01:35:11,123 --> 01:35:13,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Indy! You missed it! Left tunnel!</font>

754
01:35:44,824 --> 01:35:46,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got company!</font>

755
01:35:50,871 --> 01:35:52,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Stop.
- Let her go!</font>

756
01:35:52,706 --> 01:35:54,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let go of the brake.
- What?</font>

757
01:35:54,875 --> 01:35:56,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- Let her go.</font>

758
01:35:56,460 --> 01:35:57,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our only chance is to outrun them.</font>

759
01:36:14,937 --> 01:36:16,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shorty?</font>

760
01:36:16,147 --> 01:36:18,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come up here and take the brake.</font>

761
01:36:19,191 --> 01:36:21,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch it on the curves,
or we'll fly right off the track</font>

762
01:36:21,944 --> 01:36:23,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

763
01:37:44,610 --> 01:37:46,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you doing?
- Short cut.</font>

764
01:37:46,779 --> 01:37:48,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes, Indy.
- Short, cut.</font>

765
01:38:12,638 --> 01:38:14,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch it!</font>

766
01:38:18,269 --> 01:38:19,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy, help!</font>

767
01:38:22,898 --> 01:38:24,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- "Hang on!
- Indy!</font>

768
01:38:25,025 --> 01:38:27,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Pull him in.
- Let me go! Let me go!</font>

769
01:38:28,862 --> 01:38:30,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let go of him!</font>

770
01:38:31,574 --> 01:38:33,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! No!</font>

771
01:38:34,034 --> 01:38:35,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pull him in!</font>

772
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:36,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'll catch him!
- No!</font>

773
01:39:22,916 --> 01:39:23,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Duck!</font>

774
01:39:43,854 --> 01:39:44,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- All right.
- What?</font>

775
01:39:45,022 --> 01:39:46,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brakes. Brakes.</font>

776
01:39:46,690 --> 01:39:48,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Slow us down.
- Okay.</font>

777
01:39:53,906 --> 01:39:56,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Big mistake. Big mistake, Indy.</font>

778
01:39:56,492 --> 01:39:57,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Figures.</font>

779
01:40:18,847 --> 01:40:20,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going too fast!</font>

780
01:40:20,432 --> 01:40:21,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Too fast!</font>

781
01:40:21,892 --> 01:40:23,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going to crash!</font>

782
01:40:35,781 --> 01:40:37,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Water, water, water!</font>

783
01:40:37,491 --> 01:40:38,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Look! Look there!
- Water!</font>

784
01:40:39,118 --> 01:40:41,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Fire! You're on fire!
- Water, water!</font>

785
01:40:41,453 --> 01:40:44,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Look. ..
- Water, water.</font>

786
01:40:45,541 --> 01:40:47,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Water, water.</font>

787
01:40:48,043 --> 01:40:50,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Come on!</font>

788
01:41:03,767 --> 01:41:05,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go!</font>

789
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:11,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run, run!</font>

790
01:41:23,829 --> 01:41:25,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Willie, look out!</font>

791
01:41:35,340 --> 01:41:36,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

792
01:41:36,550 --> 01:41:39,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Head for the bridge. Go!</font>

793
01:41:40,596 --> 01:41:42,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Willie, this way.</font>

794
01:41:55,402 --> 01:41:56,737
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God.</font>

795
01:41:56,820 --> 01:42:01,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, let's go. Strong bridge.</font>

796
01:42:02,034 --> 01:42:03,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, strong wood.</font>

797
01:42:04,703 --> 01:42:06,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>

798
01:42:06,121 --> 01:42:07,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look!</font>

799
01:42:07,664 --> 01:42:09,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shorty!</font>

800
01:42:11,835 --> 01:42:13,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help! I'm falling down.</font>

801
01:42:16,507 --> 01:42:18,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help!</font>

802
01:42:19,927 --> 01:42:21,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not very funny.</font>

803
01:42:46,411 --> 01:42:47,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Back!</font>

804
01:43:13,438 --> 01:43:15,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome.</font>

805
01:43:27,786 --> 01:43:29,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let her go, Mola Ram.</font>

806
01:43:29,997 --> 01:43:33,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are in a position
unsuitable to give orders.</font>

807
01:43:34,459 --> 01:43:35,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch your back!</font>

808
01:43:45,012 --> 01:43:46,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want the stones, let 'em go.</font>

809
01:43:51,226 --> 01:43:52,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let her go!</font>

810
01:43:54,146 --> 01:43:56,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drop them, Dr. Jones.</font>

811
01:43:56,815 --> 01:43:59,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They will be found.</font>

812
01:43:59,276 --> 01:44:01,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You won't.</font>

813
01:44:04,156 --> 01:44:05,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy!</font>

814
01:44:05,324 --> 01:44:06,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Behind you!</font>

815
01:44:15,542 --> 01:44:17,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit.</font>

816
01:44:28,263 --> 01:44:29,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go on.</font>

817
01:44:31,016 --> 01:44:32,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go.</font>

818
01:44:41,652 --> 01:44:43,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go on! Go on!</font>

819
01:44:44,446 --> 01:44:46,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get moving.</font>

820
01:44:50,077 --> 01:44:52,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shorty...</font>

821
01:44:57,584 --> 01:45:00,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hang on, lady. We going for a ride.</font>

822
01:45:01,964 --> 01:45:03,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God!</font>

823
01:45:05,634 --> 01:45:09,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Oh, my God!</font>

824
01:45:09,554 --> 01:45:11,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is he nuts?</font>

825
01:45:12,057 --> 01:45:13,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He no nuts.</font>

826
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:15,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's crazy.</font>

827
01:45:15,519 --> 01:45:20,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mola Ram, prepare to meet Kali</font>

828
01:45:20,357 --> 01:45:22,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in hell.</font>

829
01:45:23,193 --> 01:45:24,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

830
01:45:24,861 --> 01:45:26,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You fool!</font>

831
01:46:26,465 --> 01:46:28,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indy, cover your heart!</font>

832
01:46:28,258 --> 01:46:30,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cover your heart!</font>

833
01:46:30,844 --> 01:46:32,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God!</font>

834
01:46:42,481 --> 01:46:43,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

835
01:47:26,858 --> 01:47:28,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Look out!
- No!</font>

836
01:47:53,718 --> 01:47:55,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

837
01:47:59,683 --> 01:48:01,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Let's go!</font>

838
01:48:02,310 --> 01:48:04,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The stones are mine!</font>

839
01:48:05,397 --> 01:48:07,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've betrayed Siva.</font>

840
01:48:11,611 --> 01:48:13,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You betrayed Siva.</font>

841
01:48:22,581 --> 01:48:23,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You betrayed Siva!</font>

842
01:48:56,114 --> 01:48:58,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it's about time.</font>

843
01:49:16,301 --> 01:49:17,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold your fire.</font>

844
01:51:20,383 --> 01:51:22,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We know you are coming back</font>

845
01:51:22,927 --> 01:51:25,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when life return to our village.</font>

846
01:51:29,768 --> 01:51:36,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now you can see the magic
of the rock you bring back.</font>

847
01:51:36,566 --> 01:51:40,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I understand its power now.</font>

848
01:51:46,117 --> 01:51:47,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You could've kept it.</font>

849
01:51:47,702 --> 01:51:49,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What for?
They'd just put it in a museum.</font>

850
01:51:49,704 --> 01:51:52,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It'd be another rock collecting dust.</font>

851
01:51:52,207 --> 01:51:55,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But then it would've given you
your fortune and glory.</font>

852
01:51:55,835 --> 01:51:57,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anything could happen.</font>

853
01:51:57,670 --> 01:51:59,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a long way to Delhi.</font>

854
01:51:59,964 --> 01:52:01,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, thanks.</font>

855
01:52:01,132 --> 01:52:03,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No more adventures with you,
Dr. Jones.</font>

856
01:52:03,468 --> 01:52:07,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sweetheart, after all the fun
we've had together?</font>

857
01:52:08,181 --> 01:52:11,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you think I'm going to Delhi with you,
or anyplace else</font>

858
01:52:11,309 --> 01:52:13,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">after all the trouble
you've gotten me into,</font>

859
01:52:13,395 --> 01:52:15,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">think again, buster!</font>

860
01:52:15,188 --> 01:52:17,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going home to Missouri
where they never feed you snakes,</font>

861
01:52:17,690 --> 01:52:20,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">before ripping your heart out
and lowering you into hot pits!</font>

862
01:52:20,485 --> 01:52:23,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is not my idea of a swell time!</font>

863
01:52:24,072 --> 01:52:26,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me, sir. I need a guide to Delhi.
If you could...</font>

864
01:52:46,845 --> 01:52:48,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very funny.</font>

865
01:52:54,519 --> 01:52:56,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very funny.</font>
