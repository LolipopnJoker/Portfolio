1
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,300
All were transported?

2
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,440
Almost.

3
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,720
"Almost."

4
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,160
Sir, with all due respect,

5
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,520
are you sure
this is our best option?

6
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,400
I mean, why can't we just
correct the problem?

7
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,440
Because my fuckin' nephew

8
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,120
killed a dog.

9
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,040
And he stole a car.

10
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,720
A car

11
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,600
which currently
is among our inventory.

12
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,320
So we're giving everything up
for a car?

13
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,360
It's not just a car.

14
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,800
It is John wick's car.

15
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,760
Oh.

16
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,480
Sir, why don't we just
give it back?

17
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,440
He killed my nephew.

18
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,200
My brother.

19
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,000
<i> And a dozen of my men.</i>

20
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,000
Over his car.

21
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,400
And a puppy.

22
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,200
And you...

23
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,440
You think he will stop now?

24
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,480
<i> Hmm?</i>

25
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,840
<i> Sir, he's one man.</i>

26
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,440
Why don't we just
eliminate him?

27
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,480
John wick

28
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,680
<i> is a man of focus...</i>

29
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,880
Commitment...

30
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,320
And sheer fuckin' will!

31
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,640
He once killed
three men in a bar...

32
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,840
With a pencil. I know.
I've heard the story.

33
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,560
With a fucking pencil!

34
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,360
Who the fuck can do that?

35
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,200
I can assure you

36
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,760
<i> that the stories you hear</i>
<i> about this man,</i>

37
00:05:54,760 --> 00:06:00,440
if nothing else,
has been watered down.

38
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:19,270
You have my car...

39
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,090
THE BOOGEYMAN.

40
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,240
Peace.

41
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:28,270
Can a man like you know peace?

42
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,550
Why not?

43
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,060
Peace.

44
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,650
Enjoy your retirement...

45
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,560
Mr. wick.

46
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,080
Hey, buddy.

47
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,160
Hey.

48
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,800
Good dog.

49
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,080
<i> What are you doing, John?</i>

50
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,080
<i> Looking at you.</i>

51
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,120
<i> What are you doing?</i>

52
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,600
<i> I'm waiting for you.</i>

53
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,680
<i> Come here.</i>

54
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,840
Hey, boy.

55
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,880
Nice peaceful place
you got here.

56
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,840
Hey, aurelio.
Hey.

57
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
John, what the hell?
I thought you loved this car.

58
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,560
What do you think?

59
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,760
Well, your motor's
about to fall out

60
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,120
and the chassis's
all bent up,

61
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,040
the driveshaft
is all destroyed.

62
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,200
And I don't know
if you noticed,

63
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,720
but you got a crack
in your windshield.

64
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,960
I mean...
What do I think?

65
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,600
I could fix this.

66
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,840
Thanks for finding her.

67
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,480
Not a problem, man.
I just made a few calls.

68
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,640
No big deal.

69
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,760
Let me know
when it's fixed.

70
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,280
All right.
It'll be ready Christmas...

71
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,560
2030.

72
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,000
Ciao, John.

73
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,280
Santino.

74
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,480
May I come in?

75
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:18,170
Of course.

76
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,680
Coffee?

77
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,920
Good to see you.

78
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,040
Good to see you.

79
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,640
I was sorry to hear
about your wife, John.

80
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,000
Thank you.

81
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,720
Hi.

82
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,360
And the dog,
does he have a name?

83
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,440
No.

84
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,880
Listen, John,
with all sincerity...

85
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,040
I don't want to be here.

86
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,680
Please, don't.

87
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,680
I'm asking you
not to do this.

88
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,680
I'm sorry.

89
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,840
No one gets out
and comes back

90
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,960
without repercussions.

91
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,480
I do this
with a heavy heart, John.

92
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,280
But remember,
if not for what I did

93
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,320
on the night
of your impossible task,

94
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,160
you wouldn't be here
right now, like this.

95
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,040
This is because of me.

96
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,800
This, in part, is mine.

97
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,680
Take it back.

98
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,680
"Take it back"?
Take it back.

99
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:14,520
A marker is no
small thing, John.

100
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,640
For a man to Grant
a marker to another,

101
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,200
is to bind a soul
to a blood oath.

102
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,960
Find someone else.

103
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,920
Listen to me.

104
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,160
What is this? Hmm?

105
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,720
Do you remember?
This is your blood.

106
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,560
You came to me.
I helped you.

107
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,240
And if you don't do this,

108
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,480
you know the consequences.

109
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,360
I'm not that guy anymore.

110
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,680
You are always
that guy, John.

111
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,560
I can't help you.

112
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,520
I'm sorry.

113
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,880
Yes. You're right.

114
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,680
You can't.

115
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,000
But he can.

116
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,480
I'll see you soon, John.

117
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,600
You have
a beautiful home, John.

118
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,960
Well, good evenin', John.

119
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,040
Hey, Jimmy.

120
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,640
Gas leak?

121
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,960
Yeah, gas leak.

122
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,200
You workin' again?

123
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,320
I'll see you, Jimmy.

124
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,240
Come on, boy.

125
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,880
Good night, John.

126
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,640
Oh, shit.

127
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,280
I'd like to see the manager.

128
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,840
How good to see you again
so soon, Mr. wick.

129
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,080
Shall I announce you?

130
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,120
Yes, please.

131
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,600
Stay.

132
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,520
Mr. wick is on his way
to see you, sir.

133
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,560
Impeccable.

134
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,480
Put these into circulation.

135
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,920
Where is he?

136
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,560
Thank you, my friend.

137
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,600
Beautiful work.
Beautiful.

138
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,160
What are you doing,
Jonathan?

139
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,400
He burned my house down.

140
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,760
You rejected his marker.
You're lucky he stopped there.

141
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,600
What the hell
were you thinking,

142
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,520
giving a marker to a man
like Santino d'Antonio?

143
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,680
It was the only way
i could get out.

144
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,560
Oh. You call this "out"?

145
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,480
What did you think
was gonna happen?

146
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,360
What did you expect? Huh?

147
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,920
Did you really think
this day was never
going to come? Hmm?

148
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,880
What does he want you to do?

149
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,080
I didn't ask.

150
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,200
I just said no.

151
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,600
Two rules that
cannot be broken,
Jonathan.

152
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,360
No blood
on continental grounds,

153
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,600
and every marker
must be honored.

154
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:16,000
Now, while my judgment
comes in the form
of excommunicado,

155
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
the high table demand
a more severe outcome

156
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
if their traditions
are refused.

157
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,000
I have no choice?

158
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,400
You dishonor the marker,
you die.

159
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,360
You kill the holder
of the marker, you die.

160
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,480
You run, you die.

161
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,080
This is what you
agreed to, Jonathan.

162
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,480
Do what the man asks.

163
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,360
Be free.

164
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,800
Then, if you want
to go after him,

165
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,000
burn his house down,
be my guest.

166
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,280
But until then...

167
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,040
Rules.

168
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,960
Exactly. Rules.

169
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,240
Without them,
we'd live with the animals.

170
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,920
Do you board?

171
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,880
I'm sorry to say, sir,
but this facility does not.

172
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,600
I, however,
would be willing to accept

173
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,840
the responsibility,
should you wish.

174
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,840
Appreciate that.

175
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,400
Does he have a name, sir?

176
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,080
No.

177
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,080
Good dog.

178
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,480
Stay.

179
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:31,160
This was
my father's collection.

180
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,480
I see little more than just
paint on canvas, of course.

181
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,520
But I do find
myself here.

182
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,800
Please.

183
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,360
I didn't want
to do this, John.

184
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:59,720
Had you stayed retired,
i would have respected it.

185
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,960
Look at you.

186
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,080
You're thinkin' about it,
aren't you?

187
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,720
You're counting exits,
guards...

188
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,120
Could you get
to me in time?

189
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,240
How would you do it,
i wonder?

190
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,280
That woman's pen?

191
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,600
His cane?

192
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,000
Maybe his glasses?

193
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,440
My hands.

194
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,320
Ah.

195
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,680
How exciting.

196
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,440
Yet, you know you
cannot, can you?

197
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:42,280
I told you
i needed that guy,

198
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,520
the way you are looking
at me right now.

199
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,040
I needed the boogeyman.

200
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,360
I needed John wick.

201
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,320
Just tell me what you want.

202
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,880
I want you to kill my sister.

203
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,440
Why?

204
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,440
There are 12 seats
at the high table.

205
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,440
Camorra, mafia,
and ndrangheta.

206
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,240
The Chinese, the Russian.

207
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,360
When my father died...

208
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,000
He willed his seat to her.

209
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,480
She represents camorra now.

210
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,720
And I can't help but wonder

211
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,520
what I might accomplish
in her stead.

212
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:38,480
You want me to kill
Gianna d'Antonio?

213
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,360
I could never do it.

214
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,880
She is my blood.

215
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,840
I still love her.

216
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,520
It can't be done.

217
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:52,760
She's in Rome
for her coronation.

218
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,440
You will take
the catacombs in...

219
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,200
It doesn't matter
where she is.

220
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:03,120
That's why I need the ghost,
<i> lo spettro,</i> John wick.

221
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,000
That's why I need you.

222
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,040
Do this for me,

223
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,960
and your marker is honored.

224
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,840
What say you?

225
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,160
Never one to waste words.

226
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,400
Fifty-nine, zero, 3.5.

227
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:39,970
Happy hunting!

228
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,400
Welcome to the Continental of Rome.

229
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:31,110
How might I be of assistance?

230
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,620
I would like a room.

231
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,800
Jonathan!

232
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,480
Julius.

233
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,280
Ciao. Nice to see you.

234
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,920
I fail to recall the last
time you were in Rome.

235
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,560
And here I'd heard

236
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,560
you had retired.

237
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,360
I had.

238
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,680
Then humor me with
but one question.

239
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,400
No.

240
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,000
All right, then.

241
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:29,280
One of our finest rooms.

242
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,360
And enjoy your stay.

243
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,800
Mr. wick.

244
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,920
Is the sommelier in?

245
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,640
I have never known him
not to be.

246
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,560
Good afternoon, Mr. wick.

247
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,560
It's been a long time.

248
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,000
I'd like a tasting.

249
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,880
I am quite excited
to show you something.

250
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,280
First...

251
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,360
<i>Good morning, Mr. Wick!</i>

252
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,320
Hi, Angelo.

253
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,720
Welcome back to Rome.

254
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,520
Would you be in
need of a new suit?

255
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,200
I am.

256
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,520
I know of your past fondness
for the German varietals,

257
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,720
but I can
wholeheartedly endorse
the new breed of Austrians.

258
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:00,120
Glock .34 and .26.

259
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:03,080
This is the original map
of the d'Antonio estate.

260
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,400
Here, you have
all the ancient ruins.

261
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,560
Tell me, Mr. wick,
is this a formal event
or a social affair?

262
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,680
Social.

263
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,400
And is this for day
or evening?

264
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,720
I need one for day
and one for night.

265
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,800
Recontoured grips.

266
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,920
Flared magwell
for easier reloads.

267
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,080
And I know you'll appreciate
the custom porting.

268
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,480
What's next?

269
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:33,120
I need something robust.
Precise.

270
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:36,920
"Robust. Precise."

271
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:42,160
This is the map of the temple
and catacombs underneath.

272
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,880
In what style?
Italian.

273
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,640
How many buttons?
Two.

274
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,120
Trousers?
Tapered.

275
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,520
How about the lining?

276
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,360
Tactical.

277
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,920
Ar-15, 11.5-inch.

278
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,800
Compensated with
an ion-bonded bolt carrier.

279
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,920
Trijicon accupoint
with one-six magnification.

280
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:05,040
And this is
the modern blueprint.

281
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,120
There are one, two,
three gates.

282
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,520
Silicon carbide discs.
Ceramic matrices.

283
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,040
Accompanying laminates.

284
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,000
Cutting-edge body armor.

285
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,520
We just sew it between
the fabric and the lining.

286
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,120
Zero penetration.
However...

287
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,040
Quite painful, I'm afraid.

288
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,280
Could you recommend anything
for the end of the night?

289
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,760
Something big, bold.

290
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,640
May I suggest
the Benelli m4?

291
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,640
Custom bolt carrier release
and charging handle.

292
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,080
Textured grips,
should your hands get wet.

293
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,160
An Italian classic.

294
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,040
Dessert?

295
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,880
Dessert.

296
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:57,600
The finest cutlery.
All freshly stoned.

297
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,200
Well done.

298
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,080
Could you do
a rush order?
I sure can.

299
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,000
Where would you
like to have it sent?

300
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,160
The hotel.

301
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,400
Shall I have everything
sent to your room?

302
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,800
Yes. Thank you.
Excellent.

303
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,360
Mr. wick?

304
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,760
Do enjoy your party.

305
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,640
Good evening.

306
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,440
Are you enjoying
the party?

307
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:16,490
Excuse me, miss.

308
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,080
Mr. Akoni is waiting.

309
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,240
Mr. Akoni.

310
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,280
Are you enjoying
the festivities?

311
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:12,690
Thank you for seeing me.

312
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,080
Please. Sit.

313
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,120
Ms. d'Antonio,

314
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,120
you can't just take
what is rightfully mine.

315
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,440
Nothing was taken.

316
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,520
Those among your own came
to us with these territories.

317
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,440
A knife was pressed
to their throats.

318
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,720
Semantics.

319
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,080
Besides...

320
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:38,480
That blade you speak of
was meant for their children.

321
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:42,920
They were only
meant to watch.

322
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:46,560
What is yours is now ours,
Mr. akoni.

323
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,640
Now go.

324
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,040
Enjoy the party.

325
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,960
Have some fun.

326
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:05,370
Why dont you go to
entertain our guests...

327
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:07,960
while I freshen up my makeup.

328
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:10,260
Okay, Signora.

329
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:16,570
What could I do without you,
Cassian?

330
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,440
John.

331
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,440
Gianna.

332
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,400
There was a time
not so long ago

333
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,640
in which I considered us
as friends.

334
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,440
I still do.

335
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,200
Yet here you are.

336
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,080
What brought you back, John?

337
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,840
A marker.

338
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:32,840
Held by?

339
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,560
Your brother.

340
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,520
Tell me, John.

341
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,640
This marker...

342
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:50,600
Is it how you got out?

343
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,240
And what was her name,

344
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,920
this woman whose life
has ended my own?

345
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,640
Helen.

346
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:03,720
"Helen."

347
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,240
This Helen...

348
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:13,080
Was she worth the price
that you now seek to pay?

349
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,000
Now,

350
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,680
let me tell you what happens
when I die.

351
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:29,760
Santino will lay claim
to my seat at the table.

352
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,760
He will take New York.

353
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:38,960
And you will have been the one
who gifted it to him.

354
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,720
What would your Helen
think about that, John?

355
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,840
What would your Helen
think about you?

356
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,480
Hmm?

357
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,360
Why?

358
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,160
Because I lived
my life my way.

359
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,800
And I will die my way.

360
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,880
Do you fear damnation, John?

361
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:41,920
Yes.

362
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:50,560
You know,

363
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:53,880
I always thought
i could escape it.

364
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,720
That I'd see it coming.

365
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,880
That I'd see you.

366
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:14,000
John?

367
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,320
Cassian.

368
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,080
You working?

369
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:27,640
Yeah.

370
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:29,400
You?

371
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,760
Yeah.

372
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,240
Good night?

373
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,160
Afraid so.

374
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,800
I'm sorry to hear that.

375
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,640
Loose ends?

376
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,600
Just one.

377
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,160
Yeah...

378
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:01,000
You're not havin'
a good night,
are you, John?

379
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:22,640
Gentlemen!

380
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:25,760
Gentlemen!

381
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:39,400
Do I need to remind you

382
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:40,800
that there will be
no business

383
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,880
conducted on
the continental grounds?

384
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:45,760
No,<i> signore.</i>

385
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:48,040
No, sir.

386
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:55,720
Now, may I suggest
a visit to the bar,

387
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,400
so you can calm yourselves.

388
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:04,160
Gin, wasn't it?

389
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:06,240
Yes.

390
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,880
Bourbon, right?

391
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:12,880
Yeah.

392
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,840
I had a marker.

393
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:42,880
Whose?

394
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:45,440
Her brother.

395
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:51,480
I see.

396
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:54,800
You had no choice.

397
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,600
He wants her seat
at the table.

398
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:04,800
He'll get it now.

399
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:08,760
Yeah.

400
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:11,520
Yeah.

401
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:15,360
So you're free.

402
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:23,040
Am I?

403
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:26,560
No.

404
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:29,720
Not at all.

405
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:35,560
You killed my ward.
Someone I was close to.

406
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:39,920
An eye for an eye, John.

407
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:42,880
You know how it goes.

408
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:46,120
Yeah.

409
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:53,840
I'll make it quick.

410
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,480
I promise.

411
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:00,000
I appreciate that.

412
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:03,080
I'll try and do the same.

413
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:13,440
This round's on me.

414
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:18,720
Consider it
a professional courtesy.

415
01:05:41,870 --> 01:05:44,870
<i>Having a tough night?</i>

416
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:50,880
<i>Can I buy a drink?</i>

417
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,120
No. Thanks.

418
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:07,300
Not him... me.
Be seeing you.

419
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:10,900
Not if i see you first.

420
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,680
<i> Hello, John.</i>

421
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:58,080
<i> I understand if you are upset.</i>

422
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:00,600
<i> And I know it might</i>
<i> feel personal.</i>

423
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:03,000
<i> But what kind of man</i>
<i> would I be</i>

424
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,280
<i> if I didn't avenge</i>
<i> my sister's murder?</i>

425
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:07,720
John?

426
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:25,040
Could you let
management know

427
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:27,080
I'll be checking out
in the morning.

428
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:06,720
Operator. How may
i direct your call?

429
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,640
- Accounts payable.
<i>- One moment, please.</i>

430
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:23,080
Accounts payable.
How may I help you?

431
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:24,480
<i> I'd like</i>
<i> to open an account.</i>

432
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:26,800
Name on the account?
John wick.

433
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:28,520
<i> Verification?</i>

434
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:30,400
<i> 9305-05.</i>

435
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:33,760
<i> State of contract?</i>

436
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:36,160
Open.
<i> Denomination?</i>

437
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,200
Seven million.

438
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:40,920
Processing. Please hold.

439
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:46,720
I appreciate
the service.
My pleasure.

440
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:48,800
You will find
safe passage below.

441
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,400
Transportation is
waiting for you.

442
01:08:55,800 --> 01:09:00,000
May you have
a safe journey, Mr. wick.

443
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:09,400
Sorry, i fucked up.

444
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:28,960
Order confirmed.

445
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:34,720
What is this?
He completed the task.

446
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:38,080
The marker is over.

447
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,240
Mark it.

448
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:43,360
If Mr. wick
isn't dead already,

449
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:44,640
he soon will be.

450
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:49,840
Will you mark it, sir?

451
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:06,400
You have no idea
what's coming, do you?

452
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:11,480
I have everyone
in New York looking for him.

453
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:13,720
I doubt
we will see him again.

454
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:17,720
Do you now?

455
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:22,360
You stabbed the devil
in the back

456
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:25,280
and forced him back
into the life
that he had just left.

457
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,920
You incinerated
the priest's temple.

458
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:31,040
Burned it to the ground.

459
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:35,920
Now he's free of the marker,
what do you think he'll do?

460
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:40,960
<i> He had a glimpse</i>
<i> of the other side</i>

461
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,600
<i> and he embraced it.</i>

462
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:44,480
<i> But you,</i> signor<i> d'Antonio...</i>

463
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:46,720
...took it away from him.

464
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:49,160
He was already back.

465
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:51,800
Oh, he came back for love,
not for you.

466
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:55,040
He owed me.
I had every right.

467
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:58,000
And now he's coming again.

468
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:01,520
<i> He did tell you</i>
<i> not to do this.</i>

469
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:05,880
He did warn you.

470
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:07,400
<i> Please notify mta personnel</i>
<i> of any suspicious activity.</i>

471
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:17,040
<i> Your attention, please.</i>

472
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:20,160
<i> The broad street bound</i>
<i> c train is now arriving.</i>

473
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:23,160
<i> Your attention, please.</i>

474
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:26,480
<i> The broad street bound</i>
<i> c train is now arriving.</i>

475
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:41,400
<i> Next stop, canal street.</i>

476
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:02,840
<i> This is canal street.</i>

477
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:08,320
<i> This is the broad street</i>
<i> bound c train.</i>

478
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:10,720
<i> The next stop</i>
<i> is rector street.</i>

479
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:36,760
<i> This is rector street.</i>

480
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:44,320
<i> This is the broad street</i>
<i> bound c train.</i>

481
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:47,480
<i> The next stop is broad street.</i>

482
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:09,320
<i> This is broad street.</i>

483
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:12,160
<i> This is the last stop</i>
<i> on the southbound c train.</i>

484
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:14,440
The blade is in your aorta.

485
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:17,440
You pull it out,
you'll bleed,
and you will die.

486
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:18,840
<i> This is the end of the line.</i>

487
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:24,480
Consider this
a professional courtesy.

488
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:27,360
<i> This is broad street.</i>

489
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:30,360
<i> This is the last stop</i>
<i> on the southbound c train.</i>

490
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,080
<i> This is the end of the line.</i>

491
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:11,560
We say things,
we see things.

492
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:15,160
The things you see
are nightmares, man.

493
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:16,960
Like this one time...

494
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:21,640
Take me to him.

495
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:26,560
Tell him it's John wick.

496
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:44,880
You know, they just...
They put it in everything!

497
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:46,720
Hey, man. You got a quarter?

498
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:35,080
As I live and breathe!

499
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:37,640
John wick.

500
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:39,480
The man.

501
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:41,920
The myth.

502
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:44,840
The legend.

503
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:46,840
You're not very good
at retiring.

504
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:50,400
I'm workin' on it.

505
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:53,680
Mr. wick doesn't remember,
but we met many years ago,

506
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:55,520
before my ascension...

507
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:59,240
When I was just
a pawn in the game.

508
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:03,520
We met and
you gave me a gift,

509
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,320
the gift that would
make me a king.

510
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:10,880
You don't remember,
but there I was,
standing in an alleyway.

511
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:14,000
I didn't even
hear you comin'.

512
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:19,640
You gave me this.

513
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:26,200
Gift from the boogeyman.

514
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:28,760
Perfect for every occasion.

515
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:34,240
But you also gave me a choice.

516
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:38,040
Pull my gun,
shoot you in the back,
and die.

517
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:40,360
Or keep the pressure
on my neck...

518
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:42,760
...and live.

519
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:47,960
And so you see,
i survived.

520
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:52,760
No one sneaks up
on me anymore,
thanks to you.

521
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:56,080
I am all-seeing
and all-knowing.

522
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:00,000
Then you know
why I'm here.

523
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:05,280
Santino d'Antonio, yes.

524
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:07,520
Your contract went wide, John.

525
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:11,280
That's bad for your health.

526
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:12,960
What's the number
up to now, Earl?

527
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:18,400
$7 million! Damn!

528
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:21,240
It's Christmas. We're going
to applebee's after this.

529
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,080
I need your help.

530
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:30,800
You have eyes begging
for change on every corner
in the city.

531
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:34,160
I'm thinkin'
you can find Santino.

532
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:37,080
I need you to move me.
Underground.

533
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:39,160
Get me to him.

534
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:42,400
How sweet it is!

535
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:45,120
The boogeyman
begging me for help.

536
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:46,880
Well, of course, John.

537
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:49,520
Yes, John.
Whatever you'd like, John.

538
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:52,280
Would you like a back rub
with that, John?

539
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:54,720
You're going to help me.

540
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:58,160
Why the fuck
would I do that?

541
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:02,120
Because I'm the only one
that can help you.

542
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:22,360
You're gonna help me out?

543
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:26,160
That's downright
upright of you, Mr. wick.

544
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:28,440
You sound positively
magnanimous.

545
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:31,960
But look around you.

546
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:35,480
How much help does it
look like I need?

547
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:48,000
It seems to me that
the real question,
Mr. wick,

548
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,920
is who in
this cruel world of ours
is going to help you?

549
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:07,720
There's a storm coming.

550
01:26:07,720 --> 01:26:11,040
Not just for me.
For all of us.

551
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:13,360
For everyone
under the table.

552
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:15,400
Yes, killing someone
who has a seat
at the high table

553
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:17,080
does create a problem.

554
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:19,040
But it's your problem, baby.

555
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:24,160
After all, none of my people
sent Gianna d'Antonio

556
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:25,920
to the hereafter.

557
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:31,200
That being said,
Santino has her seat now.

558
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:34,240
And he wants the city.

559
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:38,120
When he's done uptown,
you think he's gonna
stop at 14th street?

560
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:41,080
We'll just have
to take care of ourselves.

561
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:43,880
Oh, yeah?
For how long?

562
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:46,000
And how much blood?

563
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:48,640
You kill Santino,

564
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:51,040
the camorra,
and the high table
come for you.

565
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:55,400
I kill Santino,
they come for me.

566
01:26:56,680 --> 01:27:00,280
He's offered $7 million
for your life.

567
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:04,440
$7 million is a lot
of money, Mr. wick.

568
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:12,560
So I guess
you have a choice.

569
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:14,920
You want a war?

570
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:17,360
Or do you wanna
just give me a gun?

571
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:32,160
Somebody, please!
Get this man a gun!

572
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:41,440
Kimber 1911, .45 acp.

573
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:46,160
Seven-round capacity.

574
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:56,280
Seven rounds?

575
01:27:56,280 --> 01:27:59,920
$7 million gets you
seven rounds.

576
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:03,440
That's a million dollars
a round, baby.

577
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:15,560
Let's go.

578
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:19,760
Your descent into hell
begins here, Mr. wick.

579
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:21,560
He's at the museum.

580
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:22,720
Earl will guide you.

581
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:24,840
Do be careful
on your way down.

582
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:29,680
Oh, and remember,
you owe me.

583
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:33,120
You don't want me
owing you.

584
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:03,200
Welcome, everyone.

585
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:06,200
Let us toast to the future
of the high table

586
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:09,160
and of course,
to the memory of
my dear sister.

587
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:27,400
Nice to see you.

588
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:38,640
Mr. akoni, how are you?

589
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:34,560
Wick is here.

590
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:35,600
Yeah.

591
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:27,480
You and you, with me.
You, go.

592
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:44,720
<i> Welcome to</i>
<i> "reflections of the soul"</i>
<i> at the new modern NYC.</i>

593
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,760
<i> Within this exhibition,</i>

594
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:50,880
<i> the interplay of light</i>
<i> and the nature of self-images</i>

595
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:53,560
<i> coalesce to provide</i>
<i> an experience</i>

596
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:55,240
<i> which will highlight</i>
<i> the fragility</i>

597
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:59,040
<i> of our perception of space</i>
<i> and our place within it.</i>

598
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:02,120
<i> We hope through this exhibit</i>
<i> we can provide new insights</i>

599
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:04,120
<i> into your understanding</i>
<i> of the world,</i>

600
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:07,680
<i> and just possibly lead you</i>
<i> to deeper reflection</i>

601
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:09,120
<i> into the nature of self.</i>

602
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:20,100
My God, John.

603
01:33:20,201 --> 01:33:22,201
You dont get it.

604
01:33:23,480 --> 01:33:26,320
The marker
is complete, John.

605
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:28,000
You should have
just run away.

606
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,320
You know what the camorra
will do to you.

607
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:43,680
You think
you're old testament?

608
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:46,080
No, John.

609
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:49,400
No.

610
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:53,280
Killing me won't
stop the contract.

611
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:58,800
Killing me will make it
so much worse.

612
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:02,760
John,

613
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,320
you know what I think?

614
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:10,120
I think you are
addicted to it.

615
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:11,160
To the vengeance.

616
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:33,760
<i> Welcome to</i>
<i> "reflections of the soul"</i>
<i> at the new modern NYC.</i>

617
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:37,560
No wife.

618
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:40,480
No life.

619
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:43,800
No home.

620
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:48,440
Vengeance,
it's all you have.

621
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:51,960
You wanted me back.

622
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:53,960
I'm back.

623
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:45,880
<i> You are now exiting</i>
<i> "reflections of the soul"</i>
<i> at the new modern NYC.</i>

624
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,500
Go. I'll finish this.

625
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:50,880
<i> We hope that your journey</i>
<i> through the exhibit</i>

626
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:53,920
<i> has been one of</i>
<i> reflective contemplation</i>

627
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:56,040
<i> allowing for a new</i>
<i> perspective and insight.</i>

628
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:03,800
<i> You are now exiting</i>
<i> "reflections of the soul..."</i>

629
01:39:11,688 --> 01:39:15,988
- Be seeing you.
- Sure.

630
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:23,360
<i> You are now exiting</i>
<i> "reflections of the soul..."</i>

631
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:37,400
Good evening.

632
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,640
Is the manager in?

633
01:39:40,640 --> 01:39:43,440
The manager is always in.

634
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:50,200
Winston.

635
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:53,440
Mr. d'Antonio.

636
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:56,200
Your evening has
been colorful, I see.

637
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:59,600
Seeking safe harbor,
i presume?

638
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:01,880
I want his membership
revoked. Now.

639
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:03,520
In the eyes
of this institution,

640
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:06,240
Mr. wick has breached
no legalities.

641
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:08,320
Then you know
that I have the right
to demand of you...

642
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:12,360
Nothing. You demand nothing
of me, Mr. d'Antonio.

643
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:15,120
This kingdom is mine
and mine alone.

644
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:19,680
All right.

645
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:22,880
Then enjoy your kingdom,
Winston, while you still can.

646
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:25,840
And you
its privileges, sir.

647
01:40:38,440 --> 01:40:40,880
I'm here to see
Santino d'Antonio.

648
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:46,920
He's waiting for you
in the lounge, sir.

649
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:37,960
Duck fat.

650
01:41:37,960 --> 01:41:39,760
Makes all the difference.

651
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:41,360
Jonathan...

652
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:42,480
Have you seen
the menu here?

653
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:46,560
Lot of options.
Jonathan,
listen to me...

654
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:49,960
A man can stay here
a long time

655
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:52,200
and never eat
the same meal twice.

656
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:55,160
Jonathan,
just walk away.

657
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:58,640
Yeah, Jonathan.

658
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:00,800
Walk...

659
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:09,640
What have you done?

660
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:14,480
Finished it.

661
01:42:32,240 --> 01:42:34,080
How was he?

662
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:36,920
He was a good dog.
I have enjoyed
his company.

663
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:43,000
Let's go home.

664
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:17,280
Mr. wick?

665
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:25,600
If you would be
so inclined.

666
01:44:58,600 --> 01:44:59,680
Come on, boy.

667
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:10,120
It has been
a pleasure, Mr. wick.

668
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:18,240
Goodbye.

669
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:55,160
Jonathan.

670
01:45:55,160 --> 01:45:56,320
Winston.

671
01:45:57,920 --> 01:45:59,160
What am I lookin' at?

672
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:03,760
The camorra's doubled
Santino's open contract.

673
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:04,960
It's gone international.

674
01:46:06,240 --> 01:46:07,480
High table?

675
01:46:07,480 --> 01:46:08,480
Mmm-hmm.

676
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:11,120
And the continental?

677
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:15,080
You killed a man
on company grounds,
Jonathan.

678
01:46:15,080 --> 01:46:18,320
You leave me no choice but
to declare you excommunicado.

679
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:24,120
The doors to any service
or provider in connection
with the continental

680
01:46:24,120 --> 01:46:26,080
are now closed to you.

681
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:31,400
I am so sorry.

682
01:46:33,680 --> 01:46:35,680
Your life is now forfeit.

683
01:46:38,200 --> 01:46:40,120
Then why am I not dead?

684
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:43,720
Because I deemed it
not to be.

685
01:46:46,680 --> 01:46:47,680
Now.

686
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:17,280
You have one hour.
I can't delay it any longer.

687
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:20,360
You might need this...

688
01:47:22,440 --> 01:47:23,480
Down the road.

689
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:28,840
Winston...

690
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:31,360
Tell them.

691
01:47:32,360 --> 01:47:34,560
Tell them all.

692
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:36,520
Whoever comes,

693
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:37,800
whoever it is,

694
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:40,400
I'll kill them.

695
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:42,360
I'll kill them all.

696
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:47,680
'Course you will.

697
01:47:52,040 --> 01:47:53,280
Jonathan.

698
01:47:55,160 --> 01:47:56,640
Winston.

699
01:48:18,280 --> 01:48:19,760
Accounts payable.

700
01:48:22,160 --> 01:48:26,080
One-one-one-one-one.

701
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:29,880
In one hour.

702
01:48:30,640 --> 01:48:31,800
John wick.

703
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:35,320
Excommunicado.

704
01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:01,280
Order 11111 confirmed.
