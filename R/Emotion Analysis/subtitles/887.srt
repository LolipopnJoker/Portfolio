1
00:01:05,771 --> 00:01:08,205
Mom says we have to be polite
to her dates...

2
00:01:08,373 --> 00:01:11,069
and we will if he makes it to the door.

3
00:01:49,081 --> 00:01:52,608
- Merry Christmas, sucker.
- And don't come back for Kwanzaa.

4
00:01:53,085 --> 00:01:54,916
Think you're going out with our mama?

5
00:01:55,087 --> 00:01:56,918
I'm gonna get you two.

6
00:02:04,496 --> 00:02:07,158
Get me out of here!

7
00:02:10,902 --> 00:02:13,097
Lindsey, you really think Dad's
coming back?

8
00:02:13,271 --> 00:02:16,934
Any day now. But until then,
we have to keep Mom available.

9
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:19,336
Problem is, she's just too pretty.

10
00:02:19,511 --> 00:02:21,775
That just makes our job
a whole lot tougher.

11
00:02:22,814 --> 00:02:25,112
Sometimes I feel sorry for her.

12
00:02:25,283 --> 00:02:29,413
Well, I feel sorry for the next sucker
who tries to put the moves on her.

13
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:44,499
- Mr. Persons.
- My man.

14
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:46,694
What you got for me?

15
00:02:59,518 --> 00:03:03,682
- I'll get the door for you.
- Got that new-car smell, you know?

16
00:03:04,589 --> 00:03:06,580
This puppy's missing one thing.

17
00:03:10,128 --> 00:03:13,757
Welcome to the big leagues, Satch.
Let's make it happen.

18
00:03:15,767 --> 00:03:19,828
Look at this ride. Parchment leather
with the satin nickel trim.

19
00:03:20,972 --> 00:03:24,669
Look out, ladies, here we come. Holla.

20
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,988
Nick Persons. How's it going, man?

21
00:03:41,993 --> 00:03:43,858
How's it look?

22
00:03:57,876 --> 00:04:01,835
Keep driving, fool. That's the one
that sicced her dog on you.

23
00:04:19,531 --> 00:04:23,228
What? You want some of this, huh?
You want a piece of me?

24
00:04:40,485 --> 00:04:45,422
Oh, my goodness.
Six thousand pounds of respect.

25
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:48,491
- Yeah. It's nice, huh?
- Yeah.

26
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,991
- Take it for a spin?
- Yeah.

27
00:04:50,161 --> 00:04:51,822
I don't think so.

28
00:04:52,797 --> 00:04:57,029
- Man, what did that unit set you back?
- I got a good deal on it.

29
00:04:57,202 --> 00:04:59,796
Right. Your payments probably
cost more than my car.

30
00:04:59,971 --> 00:05:02,735
Marty, my shoes cost more than your car.

31
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:06,275
Look, Nick, here come your
favorite customers.

32
00:05:06,444 --> 00:05:10,107
- Hey, mister, you got any Yu-Gi-Oh?
- What you think?

33
00:05:10,482 --> 00:05:12,074
You got any Dragon Ball GT?

34
00:05:12,284 --> 00:05:15,253
Look, you come in here every day
asking the same questions.

35
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:20,119
We ain't got no Pokémon, no Digimon,
no Buffy, no SpongeBob...

36
00:05:20,292 --> 00:05:22,760
no Beanie Babies and no shoplifters.

37
00:05:22,928 --> 00:05:25,761
Now, get! Both of y'all, get!

38
00:05:31,036 --> 00:05:33,869
You better get.
You better get out of here.

39
00:05:35,006 --> 00:05:37,702
- You got a way with kids.
- They're like cockroaches...

40
00:05:37,876 --> 00:05:39,537
except you can't squish them.

41
00:05:41,846 --> 00:05:44,838
- You gonna clean that?
- I don't do windows.

42
00:05:45,283 --> 00:05:47,808
What? It’ll dry.

43
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:54,558
People wanna know why I hate kids.

44
00:06:18,116 --> 00:06:20,516
What's the matter with you?

45
00:06:23,755 --> 00:06:27,589
- I think I'm in love.
- Love? No...

46
00:06:27,993 --> 00:06:30,587
What do you mean, love?

47
00:06:30,962 --> 00:06:34,921
Oh, yeah, that's the new girl from
the party-planning place. Yikes.

48
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,930
- She's so fine.
- Yeah.

49
00:06:38,103 --> 00:06:40,333
- Man, I got to get with that.
- Whoa, whoa.

50
00:06:40,505 --> 00:06:41,767
She's a divorcée, man.

51
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,272
That's way too much baggage
for a guy like you.

52
00:06:45,076 --> 00:06:47,408
Don't be so quick to judge people, man.

53
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:49,740
This isn't the Nick the Quick that I know.

54
00:06:50,015 --> 00:06:52,540
- Hey, I had broccoli yesterday.
- So?

55
00:06:52,717 --> 00:06:55,845
Sometimes you got to try
something new, my friend.

56
00:06:56,021 --> 00:06:57,852
Look and learn.

57
00:07:15,874 --> 00:07:17,364
- Mom! Mom!
- Mom! Mom!

58
00:07:21,179 --> 00:07:23,374
- How was school?
- I got 100 on my test.

59
00:07:23,548 --> 00:07:25,812
- Big deal.
- Okay, all right.

60
00:07:25,984 --> 00:07:28,452
Who wants to go shoe shopping? Let's go.

61
00:07:33,224 --> 00:07:35,784
- What happened?
- Oh, man, she's a breeder.

62
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,222
Two of them.

63
00:07:59,884 --> 00:08:01,146
Hey, wait!

64
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,344
- Oh, no.
- Help!

65
00:08:03,521 --> 00:08:05,489
Do you have any jumper cables?

66
00:08:05,757 --> 00:08:08,021
No. No!

67
00:08:11,162 --> 00:08:13,926
Hey, Nick, don't do this.

68
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:16,932
She's got two kids and a broken-down car.

69
00:08:17,102 --> 00:08:20,128
What's next? You gonna
ask her mama to move in with us?

70
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:34,208
Oh, I'm so happy to see you.
I've been standing out here forever.

71
00:08:37,222 --> 00:08:38,780
You know what?

72
00:08:38,957 --> 00:08:42,484
This might not be a good idea,
because we got rain, electricity.

73
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,424
Oh, but I sure do appreciate it.

74
00:08:48,933 --> 00:08:50,230
Okay.

75
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:56,001
You know, you look so familiar.

76
00:08:56,241 --> 00:08:58,141
Have we met before?

77
00:08:58,309 --> 00:09:01,403
Well, I'm Nick. I work right across
the street from you.

78
00:09:01,579 --> 00:09:05,879
Oh, that's right. You're the guy
that owns that cute little toy store.

79
00:09:06,451 --> 00:09:09,249
Fine sports collectibles.

80
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,547
Fine sports collectibles.

81
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,553
I'll hook this up for you.

82
00:09:26,571 --> 00:09:29,165
I think my car hates me.

83
00:09:29,774 --> 00:09:32,470
Oh, but, Nick, this is a nice ride.

84
00:09:32,644 --> 00:09:34,407
- Oh, you like this, huh?
- Yeah.

85
00:09:34,579 --> 00:09:37,241
You know, look.
It even heats the undercarriage.

86
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:40,276
I like it.

87
00:09:41,186 --> 00:09:43,154
"I like it."

88
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:46,290
Remember the score:
One player, two kids and...

89
00:09:46,858 --> 00:09:48,450
Holy moly!

90
00:09:50,195 --> 00:09:51,822
Oh, that is so cool.

91
00:09:51,996 --> 00:09:53,964
That's a Satchel Paige bobblehead.

92
00:09:54,132 --> 00:09:56,225
That's when he played for the Monarchs.

93
00:09:56,401 --> 00:10:01,031
What? A woman that knows a little
something about Satchel?

94
00:10:01,206 --> 00:10:04,607
He was my daddy's idol.
He pitched for five decades...

95
00:10:04,776 --> 00:10:08,803
including three shutout innings
for the Royals at the age of 59.

96
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:12,143
Well, you know, my man Satch
used to have a saying:

97
00:10:12,317 --> 00:10:15,309
"Age is a question of mind over matter.

98
00:10:15,486 --> 00:10:18,319
If you don't mind, it don't matter."

99
00:10:18,489 --> 00:10:21,049
You know that?

100
00:10:25,496 --> 00:10:26,963
This is Suzanne.

101
00:10:27,131 --> 00:10:29,122
Hubba-hubba. Now, that's a woman.

102
00:10:29,434 --> 00:10:34,098
Plenty of smarts, easy on the eyes,
and can quote my stats.

103
00:10:34,272 --> 00:10:37,332
I don't care if she got 100 kids.
I like her.

104
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:42,007
All we gotta do is lose the small fries.

105
00:10:42,247 --> 00:10:45,182
Now, I'm not saying
drop them in the shark tank. No.

106
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,444
But there's nothing kids like more
than military school.

107
00:10:48,853 --> 00:10:50,980
Out of sight, out of mind.

108
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,087
Excuse me?

109
00:10:56,227 --> 00:10:57,353
I don't mind.

110
00:10:57,528 --> 00:11:01,191
- If you need a lift, I'll give you a ride.
- Oh, okay.

111
00:11:01,366 --> 00:11:05,769
Smooth, Nick. Here's how I think
that we gonna make our move.

112
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:08,834
Pretend like you gonna help her
with her seat belt...

113
00:11:09,007 --> 00:11:13,501
then with your free hand, put your
arm around her shoulder and... Hey!

114
00:11:13,678 --> 00:11:17,546
Let me out! How am I gonna
wave you home if I can't see the play?

115
00:11:17,715 --> 00:11:20,479
I'm a hall-of-famer.
How about showing some respect?

116
00:11:21,786 --> 00:11:23,276
And that's my story.

117
00:11:23,454 --> 00:11:25,388
What about you, Nick? Are you local?

118
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:29,316
- Black man from Oregon?
- Right.

119
00:11:29,494 --> 00:11:31,655
No. I'm from St. Louis.

120
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:35,890
I actually moved out here to play
Triple-A ball with the Beavers...

121
00:11:36,067 --> 00:11:39,503
but ended up hurting my shoulder,
and it kind of ended my career.

122
00:11:39,671 --> 00:11:41,536
Oh, you threw your arm out pitching.

123
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,572
Well, not exactly.

124
00:11:44,742 --> 00:11:48,200
I tore my rotator cuff lifting my
big-screen TV out of a U-Haul.

125
00:11:51,783 --> 00:11:53,842
- That's really sad.
- I know.

126
00:11:54,018 --> 00:11:58,717
Good thing there's athlete's insurance,
in case you do something stupid.

127
00:12:01,492 --> 00:12:04,620
So, you know, I was wondering...

128
00:12:04,796 --> 00:12:08,493
if maybe you'd consider...
If you wasn't busy...

129
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,369
- What is going on out here?
- Mom, where have you been?

130
00:12:12,537 --> 00:12:16,667
Miss Mable burned our dinner,
fell asleep and just keeps farting.

131
00:12:19,243 --> 00:12:21,404
Kevin and Lindsey, this is Mr. Persons.

132
00:12:21,579 --> 00:12:23,672
He was nice enough to give me a ride home.

133
00:12:23,848 --> 00:12:25,941
What's he want, a reward?

134
00:12:27,952 --> 00:12:29,249
You know what?

135
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,684
I really better get out of here.

136
00:12:32,056 --> 00:12:34,024
Smart.

137
00:12:36,027 --> 00:12:39,690
Hey, Nick? I don't mean to be a pest...

138
00:12:39,864 --> 00:12:44,198
but I was just wondering if you could
give me a ride to work tomorrow.

139
00:12:44,369 --> 00:12:47,463
- Of course.
- Oh, great. Thank you.

140
00:12:47,772 --> 00:12:50,400
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

141
00:12:52,377 --> 00:12:54,072
Mom, do you know what time it is?

142
00:12:54,245 --> 00:12:56,713
Excuse me, I'm the mother.
Get in the house.

143
00:12:56,881 --> 00:12:58,542
- Get in the house.
- It's raining.

144
00:12:58,716 --> 00:13:01,184
- Get in the house.
- Who is this stud, Nick?

145
00:13:01,352 --> 00:13:03,320
You're supposed to be in bed.

146
00:14:07,051 --> 00:14:10,179
Nick, thank you so much for
helping me these past couple days.

147
00:14:10,354 --> 00:14:14,723
- You are so sweet.
- Yeah, I know.

148
00:14:15,993 --> 00:14:17,688
Hey, does this seem ripe to you?

149
00:14:19,163 --> 00:14:23,657
I don't know. I don't eat food unless
it has an expiration date on it.

150
00:14:23,835 --> 00:14:28,363
Nick, you are funny. You eat worse
than my 7-year-old son.

151
00:14:28,739 --> 00:14:30,969
You kind of dress like him too.

152
00:14:31,142 --> 00:14:32,575
What's wrong with that?

153
00:14:32,877 --> 00:14:35,744
And do you know I have never
seen you without a hat?

154
00:14:36,047 --> 00:14:38,709
- You don't need to see me without it.
- Let me see.

155
00:14:38,883 --> 00:14:40,316
- What's under there?
- What?

156
00:14:40,485 --> 00:14:42,885
- Come on, Nick.
- Watch out. Get back. Hold on.

157
00:14:43,054 --> 00:14:46,023
- Get back.
- Give me that.

158
00:14:51,362 --> 00:14:54,763
Hang on. Don't move.

159
00:14:55,466 --> 00:14:57,229
There.

160
00:15:04,942 --> 00:15:06,933
- Nick, wait.
- Right.

161
00:15:07,111 --> 00:15:09,773
- Wanna go to my apartment?
- No, I can't. I can't.

162
00:15:09,947 --> 00:15:14,509
I've thought about it. I really have.
But let's be realistic. I'm a single mom.

163
00:15:14,685 --> 00:15:17,745
No, you're a sexy mama.

164
00:15:19,156 --> 00:15:22,250
Do you know this whole time
we've been hanging out...

165
00:15:22,426 --> 00:15:24,758
you've never once asked me about my kids?

166
00:15:26,831 --> 00:15:30,358
- How they doing?
- I bet you don't remember their names.

167
00:15:32,436 --> 00:15:34,996
Rudy and Theo?

168
00:15:35,172 --> 00:15:36,867
Nick.

169
00:15:40,545 --> 00:15:43,412
I think we should just be friends.

170
00:15:47,084 --> 00:15:49,485
Next point wins. Let's go.

171
00:15:50,755 --> 00:15:53,053
Hold on to your earrings there,
Yao Bling...

172
00:15:53,224 --> 00:15:57,490
because I'm gonna embarrass you.
And it's gonna hurt because I love you.

173
00:15:57,662 --> 00:15:59,926
- Give me that.
- Hey, that's a foul.

174
00:16:00,097 --> 00:16:02,429
- Come on, man, you hit my hand.
- No, I didn't.

175
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,898
Right here, baby. Right here.

176
00:16:05,069 --> 00:16:06,263
Game time.

177
00:16:07,204 --> 00:16:09,934
Yeah, baby. Yeah. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

178
00:16:10,308 --> 00:16:12,868
Get off of me, Lurch.
That was a moving pick.

179
00:16:13,044 --> 00:16:15,069
Let's run it again. Same teams. Come on.

180
00:16:15,313 --> 00:16:16,974
No. I gotta go, y'all.

181
00:16:17,148 --> 00:16:19,275
What? We're tied. Somebody has to lose.

182
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:22,613
- It's the American way.
- Hey, somebody did lose.

183
00:16:22,787 --> 00:16:25,779
- You know I gotta go do that thing.
- What thing? What?

184
00:16:25,957 --> 00:16:29,415
You know, I gotta take Suzanne
to the airport in the morning.

185
00:16:29,961 --> 00:16:33,829
Take Suzanne to the airport
in the morning.

186
00:16:33,998 --> 00:16:36,660
- You are stuck in the friend zone.
- Get out of here.

187
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:39,667
Listen to me. We've been friends
a very long time...

188
00:16:39,837 --> 00:16:42,431
and I am telling you,
you gotta dump this girl.

189
00:16:42,607 --> 00:16:45,804
- What? We not even going out.
- That's the point, Nick.

190
00:16:45,977 --> 00:16:49,105
Whatever it is you don't have
going on, it has got to end.

191
00:16:50,314 --> 00:16:53,249
Okay, for all those who listen
to this clown...

192
00:16:53,417 --> 00:16:55,851
Nick Persons will never be
in the friend zone.

193
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,478
- Understand that and believe that.
- Friend zone. Friend zone.

194
00:16:59,657 --> 00:17:02,182
- Don't say I didn't warn you.
- Friend zone.

195
00:17:10,835 --> 00:17:13,167
- Here you go.
- Oh, Nick, thank you so much.

196
00:17:13,337 --> 00:17:15,134
You are such a great friend.

197
00:17:16,073 --> 00:17:18,564
<i>The friend zone is for losers only.</i>

198
00:17:18,843 --> 00:17:22,370
<i>Please unload your friend
and get on with your life.</i>

199
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,380
- Well, wish me luck.
- Good luck.

200
00:17:27,451 --> 00:17:29,681
Thanks for everything, Nick.

201
00:17:30,888 --> 00:17:33,948
Suzanne, can I talk to you real quick?

202
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:35,720
Sure.

203
00:17:35,893 --> 00:17:39,727
You know, what we got going... I mean,
we don't really have something...

204
00:17:39,897 --> 00:17:41,956
I don't really know what to call this...

205
00:17:42,133 --> 00:17:44,067
- Hang on.
- ...but it seems kind of...

206
00:17:44,235 --> 00:17:46,396
This is Suzanne.

207
00:17:48,239 --> 00:17:50,173
Yes, Frank.

208
00:17:50,341 --> 00:17:51,365
Just one sec.

209
00:17:54,145 --> 00:17:56,306
Well, when did that happen?

210
00:17:57,014 --> 00:18:00,006
Well, actually,
I'm already at the airport.

211
00:18:00,451 --> 00:18:03,045
- Hey. You can't park here.
- I know.

212
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,121
My friend's making a call.
She'll be off in a second.

213
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:08,554
- Gonna be an expensive call.
- I'm right here.

214
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:10,622
That's why you're getting a ticket.

215
00:18:10,795 --> 00:18:14,060
They're expecting to spend
New Year's Eve with you.

216
00:18:14,231 --> 00:18:17,223
Oh, don't... Don't even go there
with me, Frank.

217
00:18:17,401 --> 00:18:20,564
You haven't spent five minutes
with your kids since Labor Day.

218
00:18:21,605 --> 00:18:26,133
Frank, you know what?
I am so sick of this.

219
00:18:27,178 --> 00:18:31,478
I... Hello? Hello?

220
00:18:31,982 --> 00:18:34,780
Know what?
That lady's got enough problems.

221
00:18:38,556 --> 00:18:40,751
All right, let's move it along.

222
00:18:46,664 --> 00:18:48,529
- I'm not going.
- What's the matter?

223
00:18:48,699 --> 00:18:52,157
My ex is sick, and he's not
gonna pick up the kids.

224
00:18:55,005 --> 00:18:57,974
- What about the babysitter?
- She's leaving for Las Vegas...

225
00:18:58,142 --> 00:19:01,669
- with her church group.
- Oh, no.

226
00:19:02,913 --> 00:19:04,778
You know, my kids miss him so much...

227
00:19:04,949 --> 00:19:08,885
and all he ever does is pull the rug
out right from under them.

228
00:19:10,855 --> 00:19:13,153
I'm gonna lose my job.

229
00:19:25,703 --> 00:19:27,864
What if I bring them?

230
00:19:28,038 --> 00:19:30,563
I couldn't ask you to do that.
That's too much.

231
00:19:30,741 --> 00:19:33,642
Why not? Look, it's no big deal. Serious.

232
00:19:36,347 --> 00:19:38,440
- Really?
- Positive.

233
00:19:39,283 --> 00:19:42,013
- Are you sure?
- I wanna help you on this.

234
00:19:43,788 --> 00:19:46,018
Nick, this is huge.

235
00:19:47,358 --> 00:19:49,019
Thank you so much.

236
00:19:49,794 --> 00:19:52,092
You are a lifesaver.

237
00:19:52,263 --> 00:19:56,324
Okay, so I'll get the three tickets, and
as soon as you guys land, call me.

238
00:19:57,301 --> 00:20:00,634
Oh, no, I meant that I'll drop them off
at the airport.

239
00:20:00,805 --> 00:20:03,899
Oh, no. You can't expect the kids
to travel alone, Nick.

240
00:20:04,074 --> 00:20:07,566
Kevin's got asthma. That recycled air
in the plane... I mean, yuck.

241
00:20:07,745 --> 00:20:09,838
But it'd be fine. Kids fly all the time.

242
00:20:10,014 --> 00:20:12,505
It's nothing.
I'll make sure they get on the plane.

243
00:20:12,683 --> 00:20:16,642
They'll get milk and cookies, little
plastic wings, get to meet the pilot.

244
00:20:16,821 --> 00:20:19,654
You know, it'd be real cool.

245
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:24,993
Especially with me sitting next to them
making sure everything is all right.

246
00:20:25,629 --> 00:20:29,224
Oh, how could I ever repay you?

247
00:20:42,346 --> 00:20:44,678
Obviously, you don't care
that she's using you.

248
00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:46,407
But ask yourself this:

249
00:20:46,584 --> 00:20:49,382
Would you trust a woman
who'd trust you with her kids?

250
00:20:49,553 --> 00:20:51,953
I'm tempted to call Child Services
right now.

251
00:20:52,356 --> 00:20:54,688
Uncle Nick loves kids.

252
00:20:55,192 --> 00:20:59,060
Big lummox.
Might as well just put myself on eBay.

253
00:21:00,764 --> 00:21:04,359
Hello. I'm here to pick up the kids.

254
00:21:06,203 --> 00:21:08,603
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

255
00:21:08,772 --> 00:21:11,935
What you wasting your time
with Miss Suzanne for?

256
00:21:12,376 --> 00:21:14,571
- Excuse me?
- You come with me.

257
00:21:15,379 --> 00:21:18,974
Miss Mable will take you
on a guided tour to Sin City.

258
00:21:19,884 --> 00:21:22,216
Oh, God. Excuse me.

259
00:21:23,287 --> 00:21:26,552
Hello? Somebody?

260
00:21:27,391 --> 00:21:29,382
Who wants to go to Vancouver?

261
00:21:45,676 --> 00:21:48,474
Mom says that we should be polite.

262
00:21:48,913 --> 00:21:52,781
Now, kids, I know you're disappointed
about your father...

263
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:56,381
but you're going to have fun.

264
00:21:57,254 --> 00:21:58,687
Aren't you?

265
00:21:58,856 --> 00:22:01,120
- Yes, Miss Mable.
- Yes, Miss Mable.

266
00:22:03,894 --> 00:22:06,089
Hey, did you bring us a gift?

267
00:22:06,263 --> 00:22:09,926
Yeah, Mom's man friends
always bring us presents.

268
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,625
Oh, of course.

269
00:22:12,803 --> 00:22:17,035
What kind of guy you think I am?
Uncle Nick loves kids.

270
00:22:17,574 --> 00:22:21,374
As a matter of fact... Look, look, look.

271
00:22:21,545 --> 00:22:23,843
Dr. Munchies pizza coupon.

272
00:22:24,014 --> 00:22:27,780
You get a free liter of soda with any
purchase of a large pepperoni.

273
00:22:27,952 --> 00:22:31,251
- What's a liter?
- Oh, yeah, and for you...

274
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:37,859
- Look at that. Corkscrew.
- Cool.

275
00:22:38,162 --> 00:22:41,325
- Hey, it's got a knife.
- You can't give him that.

276
00:22:41,632 --> 00:22:43,327
- Shut up.
- Make me.

277
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,491
I don't make trash. I bury it.

278
00:22:45,669 --> 00:22:49,969
- Well, I'll bury my foot in your...
- Say it. You're too scared to say it.

279
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,869
Be quiet, you paranoid dunce.

280
00:22:52,042 --> 00:22:53,407
- Chicken.
- Stop it. Stop it.

281
00:22:57,381 --> 00:22:59,246
Hey, wanna learn some Chinese?

282
00:23:00,651 --> 00:23:02,346
Sure. What you got?

283
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:09,517
Sensei says,
"The first one is always a decoy."

284
00:23:11,061 --> 00:23:13,120
Shotgun!

285
00:23:14,098 --> 00:23:18,296
That's my seat. You stop.

286
00:23:23,774 --> 00:23:27,073
They gonna eat you alive.

287
00:23:29,146 --> 00:23:32,115
- You're too ugly to sit in the front seat.
- That's my seat.

288
00:23:32,349 --> 00:23:34,442
Hey! Watch the paint.

289
00:23:42,126 --> 00:23:44,856
Okay, now, once we get in this terminal...

290
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:47,020
I want everybody sticking together.

291
00:23:47,197 --> 00:23:48,926
Now, be careful opening that door.

292
00:23:51,502 --> 00:23:53,527
Man! What did...?

293
00:23:57,975 --> 00:24:01,775
- Sorry, Nick.
- Oh, damn!

294
00:24:01,945 --> 00:24:05,039
- Boy, didn't you hear what I just said?
- You swore.

295
00:24:05,215 --> 00:24:08,878
You damn right I swore. That's about
$400 worth of damage to my new car.

296
00:24:09,053 --> 00:24:12,181
That's twice. Now you have to put
$2 in the swear jar.

297
00:24:12,356 --> 00:24:14,881
Yeah, well, he gotta put about $400
in my pocket.

298
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:16,890
- You got $400 for me?
- No.

299
00:24:17,061 --> 00:24:18,255
And I want it cash.

300
00:24:23,467 --> 00:24:25,935
Okay, man, no tears, all right?

301
00:24:26,103 --> 00:24:27,661
I won't change diapers out here.

302
00:24:27,838 --> 00:24:32,002
Real good. Have you ever thought
of being a youth pastor or a therapist?

303
00:24:32,176 --> 00:24:35,270
Look, it ain't like I said I was gonna
take off my belt.

304
00:24:35,446 --> 00:24:37,676
He's gonna beat me, Lindsey! Save me!

305
00:24:37,848 --> 00:24:39,782
- Hey. Hey, man.
- Don't touch me!

306
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:42,248
- Little dude. Kevin. Come here.
- Get away!

307
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:43,886
Is there a problem here, sir?

308
00:24:44,054 --> 00:24:46,318
Just a little game I'm playing
with the kids.

309
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,754
Boy, bring your butt back here!

310
00:24:48,926 --> 00:24:51,360
Kevin. Boy. Look.

311
00:24:51,528 --> 00:24:53,826
Yo, yo, yo. Hey, hey. Look, look.

312
00:24:53,997 --> 00:24:55,624
Look, I got money. Check it out.

313
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:57,562
Will that shut you up, huh?

314
00:24:57,734 --> 00:24:59,998
Here you go. Ten bucks. Come on.

315
00:25:00,971 --> 00:25:02,666
Yeah. That's right.

316
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,570
Hey, you can't buy us off. Apologize.

317
00:25:05,742 --> 00:25:07,607
No, no. We're cool.

318
00:25:08,011 --> 00:25:10,241
Yeah. We cool, little mama.

319
00:25:10,414 --> 00:25:14,180
Plus, there's enough to go around.
Got a ten-spot for you too.

320
00:25:15,486 --> 00:25:18,478
I do believe I'm older than him.

321
00:25:22,793 --> 00:25:27,162
I can't believe I'm getting hustled
by a couple of gangsters. Here.

322
00:25:27,798 --> 00:25:30,289
Now, hurry up. We can't be late.

323
00:25:32,069 --> 00:25:34,833
When we go through, they can see
our bones and innards?

324
00:25:35,105 --> 00:25:38,074
- No, fool, that's an x-ray.
- Wrong answer.

325
00:25:38,242 --> 00:25:39,504
It's a metal detector.

326
00:25:39,676 --> 00:25:41,371
Oh, to see if you have any bombs?

327
00:25:41,979 --> 00:25:43,970
You're not allowed to say "bombs" here.

328
00:25:44,148 --> 00:25:47,914
- Why can't you say "bomb"?
- Please remove all metal objects.

329
00:25:48,085 --> 00:25:50,349
Keys, loose change, cell phones, jewelry.

330
00:25:50,521 --> 00:25:52,751
Okay. Just might take a minute.

331
00:25:57,294 --> 00:26:02,561
I hope you left Nick's little present
in the car, or else you're going to jail.

332
00:26:18,182 --> 00:26:20,173
Cell phone.

333
00:26:21,985 --> 00:26:23,316
Car keys.

334
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,049
Excuse me. Sir?

335
00:26:39,169 --> 00:26:40,466
What? What?

336
00:26:40,637 --> 00:26:42,764
Sir, can you step to the red line, please?

337
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:45,272
I put everything on the tray.

338
00:26:46,543 --> 00:26:49,740
Please raise your arms
and separate your legs.

339
00:27:02,826 --> 00:27:04,054
Corkscrew!

340
00:27:11,401 --> 00:27:14,632
Let's just get out of here before
I end up in Guantánamo Bay.

341
00:27:14,805 --> 00:27:16,830
Our dad would've never given him a knife.

342
00:27:17,007 --> 00:27:19,771
- Yeah, I'm not your dad.
- That's for sure.

343
00:27:23,547 --> 00:27:25,572
All right, let's go. Pick it up.

344
00:27:25,749 --> 00:27:29,014
It's actually gonna work out better
because trains are more fun.

345
00:27:29,186 --> 00:27:31,984
- Do you got any snacks?
- You mean candy?

346
00:27:32,155 --> 00:27:33,952
- No way.
- I have to pee.

347
00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:38,826
Can't you wait till we get on the train?
It's right there.

348
00:27:38,996 --> 00:27:42,693
- I don't think I can wait that long.
- Yes, you can. Come on.

349
00:27:42,866 --> 00:27:45,596
He's prone to bladder infections,
you know.

350
00:27:47,871 --> 00:27:50,305
All right, man, go do your business.

351
00:27:52,075 --> 00:27:53,770
Aren't you coming in with me?

352
00:27:55,879 --> 00:27:58,575
Yeah, but I'm not touching nothing.

353
00:28:01,551 --> 00:28:02,950
All aboard!

354
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,021
- Come on, come on.
- I'm coming.

355
00:28:08,158 --> 00:28:10,319
Wait. My shoe's untied.

356
00:28:11,328 --> 00:28:12,989
Come on.

357
00:28:14,364 --> 00:28:16,093
All clear.

358
00:28:19,002 --> 00:28:20,333
Come on, Kevin. Hurry up.

359
00:28:22,506 --> 00:28:24,406
Over...

360
00:28:26,376 --> 00:28:29,470
Loop. Other loop.

361
00:28:31,048 --> 00:28:34,211
You know what? Let me do it.
Let me do it. Let me do it.

362
00:28:36,553 --> 00:28:38,521
No! Pull from the first loop.

363
00:28:38,689 --> 00:28:42,216
- Otherwise it's too tight at the top.
- Okay, okay.

364
00:28:42,426 --> 00:28:46,021
The boy has problems. He won't eat
anything orange, steamed or poached.

365
00:28:46,196 --> 00:28:48,892
And what he does eat, they can't touch.

366
00:28:49,132 --> 00:28:51,760
- Okay, there you go.
- No. Do it again.

367
00:28:51,935 --> 00:28:53,630
That doesn't feel right.

368
00:28:53,804 --> 00:28:55,635
His socks can't have elastic in them.

369
00:28:55,806 --> 00:28:58,400
And he won't use a toothbrush
more than five days.

370
00:28:58,575 --> 00:29:00,372
- Shut up!
- Make me.

371
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:02,273
Who'd wanna make another one...?

372
00:29:02,446 --> 00:29:03,845
Come on.

373
00:29:04,681 --> 00:29:07,309
Hold on, hold on. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

374
00:29:23,867 --> 00:29:27,234
Hey. Where's Galaktico's cape?

375
00:29:32,442 --> 00:29:34,103
Kevin.

376
00:29:35,779 --> 00:29:38,247
<i>Final boarding call
for Vancouver passengers...</i>

377
00:29:38,415 --> 00:29:40,883
<i>departing from track two.</i>

378
00:29:45,522 --> 00:29:47,888
Look, it's damp.

379
00:29:54,631 --> 00:29:57,896
Kevin! Lindsey!

380
00:30:02,172 --> 00:30:06,438
Hey! Hey! Kevin! Lindsey!

381
00:30:13,183 --> 00:30:15,413
Hey. The train's moving.

382
00:30:19,322 --> 00:30:20,949
Out my way.

383
00:30:21,358 --> 00:30:23,690
Hey! Crazy kids. Yo!

384
00:30:24,361 --> 00:30:26,989
Hey! Hey, come on!

385
00:30:27,197 --> 00:30:28,721
What are you doing?

386
00:30:28,899 --> 00:30:30,196
Sorry, lady.

387
00:30:30,367 --> 00:30:32,528
- Hey!
- What's he doing?

388
00:30:32,702 --> 00:30:36,502
I think he wants us to jump
onto a moving train.

389
00:30:42,813 --> 00:30:47,182
Hey! Kevin! Lindsey! Hey! Get up here!

390
00:30:47,451 --> 00:30:48,850
Come on!

391
00:30:49,019 --> 00:30:51,613
Hey, what are you doing? Run!

392
00:30:51,788 --> 00:30:53,915
Are you crazy? Jump!

393
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:56,183
Come on!

394
00:31:04,835 --> 00:31:06,826
Mama.

395
00:31:09,206 --> 00:31:14,234
- Hey, Nick, how's the train ride going?
- Well, we haven't exactly left yet.

396
00:31:14,411 --> 00:31:17,312
We decided to drive.
It should be much more educational.

397
00:31:17,481 --> 00:31:21,008
Oh, no, Nick, I cannot let you do that.
That's way too much trouble.

398
00:31:21,184 --> 00:31:23,311
No, no. It'll only take
a few more hours...

399
00:31:23,487 --> 00:31:26,456
and gives me a chance to get
to know Kevin and Lindsey.

400
00:31:26,623 --> 00:31:28,614
<i>Okay. I'm really impressed.</i>

401
00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:31,527
<i>- You're very sweet.
- Yes, I am.</i>

402
00:31:31,862 --> 00:31:36,299
You sound like you have everything
under control. Can I talk to the kids?

403
00:31:36,466 --> 00:31:37,990
Oh, okay.

404
00:31:38,168 --> 00:31:41,604
Look, don't tell them nothing
that happened, okay?

405
00:31:42,806 --> 00:31:44,831
<i>- He lost our luggage.
- What?</i>

406
00:31:45,008 --> 00:31:46,339
- Are you guys dating?
- No.

407
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:48,068
- No.
- Let me talk.

408
00:31:48,245 --> 00:31:49,769
We wanna go to Dad's.

409
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,376
You cannot go to Dad's now.
You're going with Nick.

410
00:31:53,783 --> 00:31:56,115
Why? Dad's house is in the same direction.

411
00:31:56,586 --> 00:31:59,521
Nick could drop us off there
on his way not to date you.

412
00:31:59,689 --> 00:32:01,850
<i>Honey, your dad is sick and in bed.</i>

413
00:32:02,025 --> 00:32:03,356
<i>Now, if you want me to...</i>

414
00:32:03,527 --> 00:32:06,724
I can just quit my job, and we'll
go live in a cardboard box.

415
00:32:07,631 --> 00:32:09,758
Whatever.

416
00:32:10,634 --> 00:32:13,068
- Let him drive.
- Be nice.

417
00:32:13,236 --> 00:32:14,931
<i>- I love you.
- Love you too.</i>

418
00:32:15,105 --> 00:32:16,766
Bye.

419
00:32:18,808 --> 00:32:22,471
Now, look, driving you two gremlins
on New Year's Eve...

420
00:32:22,646 --> 00:32:26,878
for over 300 miles was never
on the agenda. Okay?

421
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:30,542
We just drove across town,
and y'all done messed up my door.

422
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,484
So now I got to lay down some rules.

423
00:32:33,757 --> 00:32:34,781
Rule number...

424
00:32:38,295 --> 00:32:41,025
Rule number one:
Don't touch the climate control.

425
00:32:41,565 --> 00:32:43,590
Rule number two: Don't kick the seat.

426
00:32:43,767 --> 00:32:46,565
Rule number three: Don't play with toys.

427
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:50,033
- Can I play with my pizza coupon?
- No sassing me.

428
00:32:50,206 --> 00:32:53,437
No eating in the car, no drinking
in the car and no smoking.

429
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:55,305
- I don't smoke.
- Good.

430
00:32:55,478 --> 00:32:57,002
Don't start on my watch.

431
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,045
I don't want you to touch the radio.

432
00:32:59,215 --> 00:33:02,116
I don't even want you to sniff
the new-car smell.

433
00:33:02,285 --> 00:33:05,083
I want you to sit down
on that protective plastic...

434
00:33:05,255 --> 00:33:07,689
and be seen, not heard.

435
00:33:29,879 --> 00:33:34,111
You know, if you're thinking about
my mom, you're wasting your time.

436
00:33:34,818 --> 00:33:38,686
I'm not wasting my time, because
me and your mom, we're just friends.

437
00:33:38,855 --> 00:33:42,689
That's good, because Mom's still
into Dad, and he's totally into her.

438
00:33:42,859 --> 00:33:44,451
They're getting back together.

439
00:33:45,128 --> 00:33:47,494
Whoopee! I'm happy for them.

440
00:33:47,664 --> 00:33:49,256
Or maybe you guys should go out.

441
00:33:49,432 --> 00:33:52,629
A couple of dates with you would
really make her appreciate Dad.

442
00:33:55,405 --> 00:33:57,305
Let's go.

443
00:34:02,145 --> 00:34:04,579
Have a taste of my steel, zombie.

444
00:34:05,115 --> 00:34:07,879
- Yes!
- That game doesn't sound G-rated.

445
00:34:08,118 --> 00:34:10,086
Yeah, but it's keeping him occupied.

446
00:34:10,253 --> 00:34:14,417
The boy played Lady Pac-Man at the
mall and had nightmares for a week.

447
00:34:14,591 --> 00:34:16,491
- Give it here, Kevin.
- Hey, give it!

448
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:19,060
- Give it to me. What did I say?
- It's not yours!

449
00:34:19,229 --> 00:34:22,198
- Give it here now!
- You're not the boss of me!

450
00:34:22,365 --> 00:34:23,764
Cut it out.

451
00:34:23,933 --> 00:34:26,697
Why don't we call Mom
and see what she has to say.

452
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:28,837
Fine.

453
00:34:29,005 --> 00:34:30,734
You win.

454
00:34:33,109 --> 00:34:34,337
Snitch.

455
00:34:36,746 --> 00:34:38,270
Baby.

456
00:34:38,448 --> 00:34:41,178
- Big baby.
- Bigger baby.

457
00:34:41,551 --> 00:34:44,213
- Giant baby.
- Enormous baby.

458
00:34:44,387 --> 00:34:47,015
- Humongous baby.
- Colossal baby.

459
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:49,181
- Am not. Am not.
- Are too. Are too.

460
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:50,826
- Am not. Am not.
- Are too.

461
00:34:51,027 --> 00:34:52,392
Okay, okay.

462
00:34:52,562 --> 00:34:55,360
You're both acting
like a couple of babies.

463
00:35:12,082 --> 00:35:13,811
Keep it moving. Come on.

464
00:35:15,685 --> 00:35:18,745
That's right. Drink your juice, baby.

465
00:35:19,689 --> 00:35:23,386
- Hey, no food in the car.
- It's not food. It's juice.

466
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,152
- Same difference. Give it.
- Mine.

467
00:35:25,328 --> 00:35:26,852
Hey!

468
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,463
Man, see?

469
00:35:28,631 --> 00:35:30,861
Oh, y'all think that's funny, don't you?

470
00:35:31,034 --> 00:35:32,729
It's not funny.

471
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:41,777
Whoa, whoa, whoa. No.

472
00:35:42,045 --> 00:35:44,570
One thing you gotta know here,
we keep it real.

473
00:35:44,748 --> 00:35:46,477
You can believe that.

474
00:35:51,488 --> 00:35:52,716
Yuck! Noisy.

475
00:35:52,889 --> 00:35:55,119
- What is that?
- 50 Cent.

476
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:57,782
Well, I'll pay him a dollar
just to shut up.

477
00:35:59,763 --> 00:36:02,197
Do you have any Justin Timberlake
or Clay Aiken?

478
00:36:03,666 --> 00:36:06,362
Lord, these kids
are ethnically challenged.

479
00:36:06,903 --> 00:36:08,461
Do you know you can get shot...

480
00:36:08,638 --> 00:36:10,970
by playing those CDs
in my old neighborhood?

481
00:36:11,141 --> 00:36:14,577
- We're not ghetto.
- Or trying to be ghetto fabulous.

482
00:36:14,744 --> 00:36:16,939
We're just fabulous.

483
00:36:35,899 --> 00:36:38,493
About time. Open road.

484
00:36:38,668 --> 00:36:40,499
Vancouver, here we come.

485
00:36:52,482 --> 00:36:53,676
Yeah.

486
00:37:08,464 --> 00:37:09,692
I have to pee.

487
00:37:10,099 --> 00:37:12,795
What? No, no, you do not have to pee.

488
00:37:12,969 --> 00:37:14,834
Didn't you go at the train station?

489
00:37:15,004 --> 00:37:17,871
I tried to go, but there was a man
standing next to me...

490
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:19,338
so it just went away.

491
00:37:19,509 --> 00:37:21,875
But look, man, all this open road.

492
00:37:22,045 --> 00:37:24,707
You can hold it. I know you can.
Cross your legs.

493
00:37:26,149 --> 00:37:29,243
- You should've asked before we left.
- I did.

494
00:37:29,419 --> 00:37:33,219
No, you asked before we got on the
train, not before we left the station.

495
00:37:33,489 --> 00:37:35,684
You're supposed to ask
before every segment.

496
00:37:35,925 --> 00:37:38,723
- Everyone knows that.
- Evidently not.

497
00:37:39,128 --> 00:37:41,790
I'm not gonna make it.
Do you have a bottle?

498
00:37:42,065 --> 00:37:44,192
- No.
- How about this ashtray?

499
00:37:44,367 --> 00:37:46,665
Kevin, there's no receptacle
in this vehicle.

500
00:37:46,836 --> 00:37:50,033
Now, look, the exit is about
a mile away, and you can hold it.

501
00:37:50,673 --> 00:37:52,868
How far is a mile?

502
00:37:53,042 --> 00:37:56,273
I don't know, 5000 and some kind of feet.

503
00:37:56,446 --> 00:37:59,938
Look, think of something else.
Football, a math test...

504
00:38:00,116 --> 00:38:02,141
puberty.

505
00:38:03,086 --> 00:38:04,986
- Are we there yet?
- No.

506
00:38:05,154 --> 00:38:07,088
I'm sure the carpet is absorbent.

507
00:38:07,257 --> 00:38:08,747
Oh, here it comes!

508
00:38:09,158 --> 00:38:12,594
For God's sakes, man,
he's gonna make his water in your car!

509
00:38:12,762 --> 00:38:14,093
No, he ain't.

510
00:38:17,901 --> 00:38:22,099
Incoming! Incoming! Incoming!

511
00:38:23,273 --> 00:38:25,241
Hold it, man.

512
00:38:25,608 --> 00:38:29,271
- Hold it. Oh, no. Look, right here.
- Yeah.

513
00:38:32,215 --> 00:38:33,477
Here we go. Here we go.

514
00:38:39,155 --> 00:38:41,988
In here, in here. Hold it, hold it.

515
00:38:42,158 --> 00:38:43,716
- This is taken!
- I'm sorry!

516
00:38:43,893 --> 00:38:46,953
- Oh, it's dribbling out.
- Okay, go, go. Just go.

517
00:38:53,202 --> 00:38:55,295
- That's disgusting!
- Hey, wait a minute.

518
00:38:55,471 --> 00:38:57,132
Wait a minute, lady. Hold up.

519
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:17,990
Bought us some groceries for later.

520
00:39:18,161 --> 00:39:19,822
Your mama said you liked fruit.

521
00:39:21,464 --> 00:39:23,796
- Garlic olives?
- Hey, it's a truck stop.

522
00:39:23,967 --> 00:39:25,366
That's all they had.

523
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:31,038
You see this?

524
00:39:32,108 --> 00:39:34,508
Because of you guys,
I gotta do this right here.

525
00:39:34,677 --> 00:39:37,544
You squeezed it, not me.

526
00:39:37,847 --> 00:39:39,405
It's not coming out.

527
00:39:42,952 --> 00:39:44,943
Hit that green button for me, please.

528
00:39:47,824 --> 00:39:51,191
- Yo, yo, yo.
- Hey. Hey, it's Marty. What's up, man?

529
00:39:51,361 --> 00:39:54,228
How's it going with those
stupid brats you got with you?

530
00:39:54,397 --> 00:39:58,766
<i>Remember this: If the kids hate you,
the mama won't date you.</i>

531
00:39:58,935 --> 00:40:01,130
- Man!
- Where'd you go?

532
00:40:01,304 --> 00:40:02,771
What, are you in a tunnel?

533
00:40:02,939 --> 00:40:04,531
Are you...? Hello?

534
00:40:12,348 --> 00:40:13,610
Okay. All right.

535
00:40:15,952 --> 00:40:17,749
Seat belts.

536
00:40:18,855 --> 00:40:21,255
Nobody gotta go to the bathroom, right?

537
00:40:24,494 --> 00:40:26,052
Okay, here we go.

538
00:40:30,833 --> 00:40:33,063
Nick, we already know about you and Mom.

539
00:40:34,837 --> 00:40:36,566
- You do?
- Of course.

540
00:40:36,739 --> 00:40:39,799
- She talks about you all the time.
- Yeah, Mom's into you.

541
00:40:39,976 --> 00:40:42,536
She says you're better looking
than Taye Diggs.

542
00:40:42,712 --> 00:40:44,043
Oh, yeah?

543
00:40:44,213 --> 00:40:46,477
- I am, huh?
- Oh, sure.

544
00:40:46,649 --> 00:40:49,049
In fact, she told me...

545
00:40:50,053 --> 00:40:52,886
My gosh. Get his inhaler.
He's having an asthma attack.

546
00:40:53,056 --> 00:40:55,581
- What? Where is it?
- It's in the back. Hurry up!

547
00:40:55,858 --> 00:40:57,382
- Go! Go!
- All right, I'm going.

548
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,084
- I got it. I got it.
- Move it!

549
00:41:01,364 --> 00:41:03,025
Good one, Lindsey.

550
00:41:03,733 --> 00:41:05,200
Very funny.

551
00:41:05,368 --> 00:41:07,165
- Open up.
- I knew you were lying.

552
00:41:07,336 --> 00:41:10,703
"We're just friends." You're just
using us to suck up to our mama.

553
00:41:10,873 --> 00:41:12,101
- What?
- Yeah.

554
00:41:12,275 --> 00:41:16,439
You're just a dirty, horny sex man
like all the others. Nasty man.

555
00:41:16,612 --> 00:41:18,671
- You're a nasty, bad man.
- Look...

556
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:21,180
I tried to do your mama
a favor, you booger.

557
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:23,978
You probably wanna kiss her, don't you?

558
00:41:24,153 --> 00:41:26,917
Look, look. Off the glass. Off the glass.

559
00:41:27,723 --> 00:41:29,987
And you, open this door.

560
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:31,751
You forgot the magic word.

561
00:41:32,528 --> 00:41:35,827
- Open this damn door.
- You just swore again.

562
00:41:35,998 --> 00:41:39,058
- Lindsey, he just swore again.
- So what?

563
00:41:39,235 --> 00:41:42,432
- Hey, I'm not playing with you.
- You can't make us do anything.

564
00:41:42,872 --> 00:41:44,703
Hey, this is my car!

565
00:41:44,874 --> 00:41:47,172
You hear me, little girl? This is my car!

566
00:41:49,378 --> 00:41:52,142
You better not. Look at me. I'm serious.

567
00:41:52,748 --> 00:41:55,842
I'm not playing with you,
little girl, okay?

568
00:41:56,185 --> 00:41:58,585
If you don't open up
before I count to three...

569
00:41:58,754 --> 00:42:00,016
somebody gonna get it.

570
00:42:02,125 --> 00:42:03,558
One.

571
00:42:06,095 --> 00:42:07,460
Two.

572
00:42:08,731 --> 00:42:09,993
Three.

573
00:42:10,566 --> 00:42:13,967
No! No! Hey, you stop that car!

574
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,169
Where did he go?

575
00:42:21,444 --> 00:42:23,344
- Now you gonna get it!
- Go! Floor it!

576
00:42:23,813 --> 00:42:25,644
Get out of there! Whoa! Hey!

577
00:42:26,115 --> 00:42:28,276
Stop! Wait a minute!

578
00:42:28,451 --> 00:42:31,147
I don't have any insurance on you, girl!

579
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,651
Hey!

580
00:42:33,289 --> 00:42:36,747
Watch what you're doing!
Watch the spinners!

581
00:42:37,093 --> 00:42:39,118
You're messing up my spinners!

582
00:42:39,295 --> 00:42:41,889
- You know how much they cost?
- You can't catch us.

583
00:42:42,565 --> 00:42:44,032
No!

584
00:42:49,572 --> 00:42:51,631
You little... Give me them keys!

585
00:42:51,807 --> 00:42:54,207
- Dirty sex man.
- What y'all think you're doing?

586
00:42:54,377 --> 00:42:57,369
Let go of my hat! Give me them keys!

587
00:43:00,183 --> 00:43:02,344
Hey, Lindsey, stop this crazy thing!

588
00:43:02,518 --> 00:43:05,351
That man's setting a bad example
for them kids.

589
00:43:05,521 --> 00:43:06,783
- Wait a minute!
- Go! Go!

590
00:43:18,301 --> 00:43:20,428
Now that's frontier justice.

591
00:43:51,434 --> 00:43:53,425
- Hey, turn up the rear heat.
- Yeah.

592
00:43:53,603 --> 00:43:55,127
No. No heat.

593
00:43:55,304 --> 00:43:57,829
No talking.
You're lucky I'm letting you live.

594
00:43:58,007 --> 00:43:59,998
- But...
- But my butt.

595
00:44:00,176 --> 00:44:02,736
I should pull off
on the side of the road...

596
00:44:02,912 --> 00:44:05,073
dig a hole, and bury both you two.

597
00:44:05,581 --> 00:44:07,481
That's what I should do. Yeah.

598
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:10,744
A hundred years from now,
a grizzly will find your bones...

599
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,514
and pick his teeth with them.
Wouldn't like that.

600
00:44:13,823 --> 00:44:16,485
Can't believe you two. Are you crazy?

601
00:44:16,993 --> 00:44:19,518
- We have rights.
- No, no, you have no rights.

602
00:44:22,098 --> 00:44:26,091
This is my ship, buddy.
I'm the CEO of this SUV.

603
00:44:26,269 --> 00:44:27,827
Believe that.

604
00:44:28,638 --> 00:44:32,699
Breaker, breaker, 26, this is Big Al
out on Highway 5, mile marker 16.

605
00:44:32,875 --> 00:44:36,242
I got two little lambs here been
snatched up by the big, bad wolf.

606
00:44:36,412 --> 00:44:38,778
I need some backup, pronto.

607
00:44:40,349 --> 00:44:42,442
<i>Ten-four, Big Al. Let's squash this bug.</i>

608
00:44:43,486 --> 00:44:48,048
You had no consideration
for my life, your life or my spinners.

609
00:44:52,495 --> 00:44:54,019
What? What do you want?

610
00:44:54,196 --> 00:44:56,130
I'm driving here!

611
00:45:08,778 --> 00:45:11,747
Mister In-a-Hurry. Idiot.

612
00:45:17,219 --> 00:45:18,846
Why is he slowing down?

613
00:45:28,564 --> 00:45:30,191
I don't like this.

614
00:45:30,566 --> 00:45:33,501
Pull over right now.
Pull it over. Pull it over.

615
00:45:33,669 --> 00:45:36,331
- You better do what he says.
- Like hell I will.

616
00:45:36,505 --> 00:45:38,700
I've seen those vigilante trucker movies.

617
00:45:40,543 --> 00:45:42,374
I said, pull over!

618
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:45,670
What you doing?

619
00:45:46,215 --> 00:45:47,546
Oh, no!

620
00:45:53,689 --> 00:45:55,384
My paint!

621
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,384
You think you got me boxed in?

622
00:45:59,729 --> 00:46:03,187
Well, you can kiss my 330
cubic inches of V8 power, sucker!

623
00:46:04,233 --> 00:46:05,723
Hold on.

624
00:46:25,054 --> 00:46:26,453
Help!

625
00:46:29,291 --> 00:46:32,055
Your insurance premiums
are going through the roof.

626
00:47:20,276 --> 00:47:23,143
No! No! No!

627
00:47:24,914 --> 00:47:26,779
What was Mom thinking?

628
00:47:26,949 --> 00:47:30,146
I don't know. I like him.
He's kind of funny.

629
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:31,911
Hey, don't get soft.

630
00:47:32,087 --> 00:47:35,545
This man is not our daddy. He's the enemy.

631
00:47:37,827 --> 00:47:40,295
Take me now! Take me now!

632
00:47:40,729 --> 00:47:43,994
This is why we don't come to the city.

633
00:48:06,405 --> 00:48:08,165
Look. Look, man, all I need...

634
00:48:08,323 --> 00:48:12,669
is four rims and four tires,
and I'm gone, I'm out of here.

635
00:48:12,828 --> 00:48:14,129
Can you help me?

636
00:48:14,288 --> 00:48:19,510
No, I cannot do it. I told you already,
the SUV is too big. You no listen.

637
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:23,388
- So look, use smaller ones.
- Smaller?

638
00:48:23,547 --> 00:48:25,757
Okay. I put on a smaller tire for you.

639
00:48:25,958 --> 00:48:27,885
- Good.
- Now, you come back Tuesday.

640
00:48:28,085 --> 00:48:29,948
- What?
- Today is New Year's Eve.

641
00:48:30,087 --> 00:48:32,973
Time for me to go home.
Thank you. Bye-bye.

642
00:48:33,632 --> 00:48:36,977
See, there's Dad's right there.
It's about 30 miles away.

643
00:48:37,177 --> 00:48:39,855
I'm not walking 30 miles.

644
00:48:40,681 --> 00:48:43,358
Who said anything about walking?

645
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:47,654
But I have to go home.
It's New Year's Eve. Dick Clark.

646
00:48:47,855 --> 00:48:51,033
- Let me just pay you extra.
- No, no, no and no.

647
00:48:51,233 --> 00:48:53,535
I can make it worth your while.

648
00:48:53,635 --> 00:48:58,040
See what I got? Yao Ming. Rookie card.

649
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:01,135
Oh, I see. So you think
that just because I am Chinese...

650
00:49:01,293 --> 00:49:03,670
you can get me to do anything.

651
00:49:04,705 --> 00:49:06,340
Hologram.

652
00:49:08,584 --> 00:49:10,802
My Navigator.

653
00:49:15,841 --> 00:49:17,351
No!

654
00:49:20,012 --> 00:49:21,522
Kevin!

655
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:25,609
Lindsey! Stop playing,
because I'm not in the mood!

656
00:49:32,357 --> 00:49:34,318
Hey! Hey!

657
00:49:34,735 --> 00:49:36,620
Dad's, here we come.

658
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:42,167
Damn! Hey! Hey!

659
00:49:42,326 --> 00:49:45,609
Hey! What are you doing?

660
00:49:45,738 --> 00:49:47,915
Jump! Jump!

661
00:49:48,115 --> 00:49:49,666
You think he can catch us?

662
00:49:49,867 --> 00:49:51,293
Hey!

663
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:54,555
- Maybe 10 years ago.
- Hey!

664
00:49:54,755 --> 00:49:57,516
Don't be scared. Just jump.

665
00:49:57,716 --> 00:49:59,351
No!

666
00:50:03,931 --> 00:50:06,692
What's wrong with you kids?

667
00:50:23,492 --> 00:50:24,481
Come on.

668
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:27,522
Come on. Get! Go!

669
00:50:30,432 --> 00:50:32,662
Come on, fleabag.

670
00:50:35,671 --> 00:50:37,138
No way!

671
00:50:37,306 --> 00:50:40,798
What? Now, get your narrow
butts on this horse now!

672
00:50:47,316 --> 00:50:50,808
- Hey, how you doing, baby?
- Hi. Is everything okay?

673
00:50:51,253 --> 00:50:53,915
Oh, yeah, everything is cool.

674
00:50:54,089 --> 00:50:55,579
Can I call you right back?

675
00:50:55,758 --> 00:50:58,158
Wait, what's that sound?
You sound very jiggly.

676
00:50:59,561 --> 00:51:02,086
Must be your phone.
Everything's cool on this end.

677
00:51:02,264 --> 00:51:05,256
- Are you gonna be here soon?
- Sort of. Kind of.

678
00:51:06,535 --> 00:51:08,264
Let me call you back in 10 minutes.

679
00:51:08,437 --> 00:51:10,598
Wait, wait, I wanna say hi to the kids.

680
00:51:11,073 --> 00:51:12,540
Oh, okay.

681
00:51:13,075 --> 00:51:16,442
She wanna talk to you guys
and make sure everything is all right.

682
00:51:18,814 --> 00:51:20,714
- Hi, Mom.
- Hey.

683
00:51:20,883 --> 00:51:22,578
<i>Hi, babies. How are you doing?</i>

684
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:25,185
<i>- Are you having fun with Nick?
- Come on.</i>

685
00:51:25,654 --> 00:51:27,588
Hit the turbo!

686
00:51:27,823 --> 00:51:30,451
Let's go! Let's go!

687
00:51:34,229 --> 00:51:37,562
I know, baby, but just try
to make the best of it, okay?

688
00:51:37,733 --> 00:51:41,430
<i>- I love you.
- Love you too. Bye.</i>

689
00:51:45,774 --> 00:51:48,937
- Scoot over, I'm coming aboard.
- That's a bad idea.

690
00:51:49,111 --> 00:51:50,738
- Says who?
- Says the guy...

691
00:51:50,913 --> 00:51:52,505
who put all that junk there.

692
00:51:53,549 --> 00:51:55,039
Oh, snap!

693
00:52:09,798 --> 00:52:11,663
I hate horses.

694
00:52:16,138 --> 00:52:19,596
What take so long?
I have to hang mirror ball.

695
00:52:32,054 --> 00:52:34,716
You little snotty-nosed runts.

696
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:36,551
I know exactly where you are.

697
00:52:36,725 --> 00:52:38,750
You messing with Nick the Quick, baby.

698
00:52:38,927 --> 00:52:42,021
Now's your chance. Hit yourself
over the head with a brick...

699
00:52:42,197 --> 00:52:44,495
and say that they were kidnapped.

700
00:52:44,666 --> 00:52:46,133
Shut up.

701
00:52:50,839 --> 00:52:52,898
Happy New Year.

702
00:53:03,051 --> 00:53:04,882
You think Nick's okay?

703
00:53:05,053 --> 00:53:07,021
What are you worried about him for?

704
00:53:07,189 --> 00:53:09,885
I'm not. It's just...

705
00:53:10,058 --> 00:53:11,787
maybe we were a little rough.

706
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,188
Oh, please.

707
00:53:13,362 --> 00:53:16,525
That player got what he deserved.

708
00:53:16,698 --> 00:53:18,757
"Get your butts on this horse."

709
00:53:18,934 --> 00:53:21,494
"You got $400?"

710
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:28,009
I've been thinking. We should've
brought soup or something.

711
00:53:28,177 --> 00:53:29,405
What for?

712
00:53:29,578 --> 00:53:32,411
Because Dad's sick. What is he gonna eat?

713
00:53:32,581 --> 00:53:34,481
He's a dad. I'm sure he has soup.

714
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:37,951
He must be lonely, living all by himself.

715
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,712
Look, don't bug him about that.

716
00:53:39,888 --> 00:53:43,153
If we want him to hook up with Mom,
we have to be subtle. Got it?

717
00:53:43,325 --> 00:53:44,883
I got it.

718
00:54:21,163 --> 00:54:23,791
Come on, y'all. Let's get out of here.

719
00:54:57,699 --> 00:55:00,497
Want some chocolate cake?
It's world-famous.

720
00:55:00,669 --> 00:55:02,933
Mom says I shouldn't have sugar.

721
00:55:05,474 --> 00:55:08,307
What about you?
It’ll make your mouth all chocolatey.

722
00:55:09,211 --> 00:55:10,439
No, thanks.

723
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:44,301
Hey. You forgot something.

724
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:54,452
Sorry about what happened today.

725
00:55:55,324 --> 00:55:57,918
I really wish you guys
didn't have to see that.

726
00:55:59,695 --> 00:56:01,822
He used to look at me like that.

727
00:56:03,031 --> 00:56:04,692
I know, man.

728
00:56:06,735 --> 00:56:09,863
And when he hugged you,
you thought he'd never let you go.

729
00:56:10,906 --> 00:56:14,307
They make you laugh,
they tell you they love you...

730
00:56:14,476 --> 00:56:16,444
then one day, they never come back.

731
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:20,443
I bet you know all about leaving,
don't you, player?

732
00:56:22,818 --> 00:56:25,480
Know what? As a matter of fact, I do.

733
00:56:26,922 --> 00:56:30,323
But only because the same thing
happened to me when I was your age.

734
00:56:31,259 --> 00:56:33,250
Yeah, my pops walked out on us too.

735
00:56:35,964 --> 00:56:38,626
It's a shame that anybody
can call theyself a father.

736
00:56:39,067 --> 00:56:40,364
But listen...

737
00:56:40,535 --> 00:56:42,935
he's the failure in this, not you.

738
00:56:43,638 --> 00:56:45,833
He's the one that's gonna miss out.

739
00:56:46,942 --> 00:56:50,935
I just hope it don't take you guys as
long as it took me to figure that out...

740
00:56:51,313 --> 00:56:54,544
because it's true.
You guys are some cool kids.

741
00:56:58,754 --> 00:57:01,587
There you go.
Come on, let's get out of here.

742
00:57:18,206 --> 00:57:20,606
- Nick?
- What's up, little man?

743
00:57:21,243 --> 00:57:24,679
If my dad left and your dad left...

744
00:57:25,113 --> 00:57:27,673
does that mean I'll end up like you?

745
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:31,417
I ain't doing too bad.
Look, I have blingage.

746
00:57:31,787 --> 00:57:33,414
That's not exactly what I meant.

747
00:57:33,855 --> 00:57:37,484
<i>I was watching Oprah, and it was
all about how depressed and lonely...</i>

748
00:57:37,659 --> 00:57:40,787
- bachelors like you are.
- But I'm not depressed or lonely.

749
00:57:40,962 --> 00:57:42,589
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

750
00:57:42,764 --> 00:57:44,425
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

751
00:57:44,599 --> 00:57:47,830
Mom says that if a man is
not married by the time he's 35...

752
00:57:48,103 --> 00:57:50,833
- he's either damaged or gay.
- What?

753
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,631
Well, that would explain those earrings.

754
00:57:54,409 --> 00:57:55,603
Watch it, sucker.

755
00:57:55,777 --> 00:57:58,302
But you do have intimacy issues,
don't you?

756
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,004
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

757
00:58:00,182 --> 00:58:01,513
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

758
00:58:01,683 --> 00:58:03,913
Look, it's obvious you need a timeout...

759
00:58:04,086 --> 00:58:05,917
and you need a little tickle time.

760
00:58:06,088 --> 00:58:10,787
Because all you do is ask
a thousand questions, huh?

761
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:13,325
Hey. Are you all right?

762
00:58:17,265 --> 00:58:18,789
Kevin.

763
00:58:23,171 --> 00:58:25,435
I'm good.

764
00:58:25,607 --> 00:58:28,804
- You sure?
- Yeah, except...

765
00:58:28,977 --> 00:58:31,639
- I'm out.
- Okay, don't worry about that.

766
00:58:31,813 --> 00:58:33,713
We'll get you more once we get there.

767
00:58:34,015 --> 00:58:35,710
Oh, sure, we can wait...

768
00:58:35,884 --> 00:58:37,784
if you want me to die!

769
00:58:44,726 --> 00:58:48,162
They're closing! Do something, Nick.

770
00:58:48,330 --> 00:58:51,231
No, no, wait. Hold on!
Wait a minute. We need a refill.

771
00:58:51,399 --> 00:58:53,765
Sorry, we're closed. Come back Tuesday.

772
00:58:53,935 --> 00:58:55,903
But I got a sick kid here.

773
00:58:58,707 --> 00:59:01,676
Look, I couldn't help you
even if I wanted to.

774
00:59:01,843 --> 00:59:03,868
The pharmacist has left for the holiday.

775
00:59:04,045 --> 00:59:06,479
- Well, where is he?
- He's off duty.

776
00:59:06,748 --> 00:59:10,548
And I doubt very much he's gonna
want some guy interrupting his holi...

777
00:59:13,922 --> 00:59:16,447
Just a second, sir,
and I'll draw you up a map.

778
00:59:22,264 --> 00:59:24,824
Hey, Nick, that guy was such a meanie.

779
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,025
How'd you get him to do what you wanted?

780
00:59:27,202 --> 00:59:29,966
Oh, that was simple.
I just gave him the look.

781
00:59:30,138 --> 00:59:31,537
It works every time.

782
00:59:31,706 --> 00:59:35,073
- It even worked through glass?
- Oh, yeah.

783
00:59:35,243 --> 00:59:37,871
The look is something
I developed when I was a kid.

784
00:59:38,046 --> 00:59:39,741
I had somewhat of a reputation.

785
00:59:39,915 --> 00:59:42,008
Surprise, surprise.

786
00:59:42,184 --> 00:59:45,676
I don't want everybody stepping
to me, so I give them the look...

787
00:59:45,854 --> 00:59:47,549
which told them, "Back off.

788
00:59:47,722 --> 00:59:50,486
That's a bad mother..." "Shut your mouth."

789
00:59:50,659 --> 00:59:52,718
I wish I could do that.

790
00:59:52,894 --> 00:59:55,021
You got somebody bothering you at school?

791
00:59:55,197 --> 00:59:58,189
An asthmatic in the accelerated
program? What do you think?

792
01:00:01,836 --> 01:00:04,634
Try this. It's foolproof.

793
01:00:07,075 --> 01:00:09,635
No, no, check the lip, check the lip.

794
01:00:13,715 --> 01:00:15,649
Man, do not take my lunch money.

795
01:00:17,285 --> 01:00:19,753
Here we go, killer. Come on.

796
01:00:32,367 --> 01:00:34,460
Hey, hey, where y'all going?

797
01:00:37,606 --> 01:00:40,131
Excuse me, I'm looking for the pharmacist.

798
01:00:40,442 --> 01:00:41,773
Delwyn? Sure.

799
01:00:41,943 --> 01:00:43,968
He's...

800
01:00:44,145 --> 01:00:46,409
- He's right over there.
- That's enough.

801
01:00:46,581 --> 01:00:48,014
- I got it.
- Give me that.

802
01:00:48,583 --> 01:00:50,949
Stop clowning around now.

803
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:52,711
- Yo.
- Give me my shoe.

804
01:00:52,887 --> 01:00:55,151
Yo. Excuse me, are you the pharmacist?

805
01:00:55,890 --> 01:00:57,551
Not at the moment. Why?

806
01:00:57,859 --> 01:01:01,192
Well, look, I got a kid with me, man.
He's got asthma real bad.

807
01:01:02,864 --> 01:01:05,230
Try some steam. That usually helps.

808
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,493
Hey, hey. Knock it off.

809
01:01:07,669 --> 01:01:09,762
- Steam?
- That's enough of that.

810
01:01:09,938 --> 01:01:14,568
Look, look, all I need is a refill, okay?
And I know you can help.

811
01:01:14,743 --> 01:01:17,075
I'm asking you nice.

812
01:01:18,446 --> 01:01:22,507
Mister, I've been married
for 38 years. You can't scare me.

813
01:01:22,684 --> 01:01:26,347
Come on, man, you the pharmacist.
I know you took a oath or something.

814
01:01:26,855 --> 01:01:28,584
Not that I can remember, no.

815
01:01:28,757 --> 01:01:31,157
Hey, will you go over there
and behave yourself?

816
01:01:31,326 --> 01:01:33,419
Yeah, go get him over there.

817
01:01:34,529 --> 01:01:36,724
You know, folks around here
like to barter.

818
01:01:37,198 --> 01:01:39,325
You get what you want, I get what I want.

819
01:01:39,501 --> 01:01:43,130
One hand washes the other.
I scratch your back...

820
01:01:43,305 --> 01:01:45,068
Get to the point.

821
01:01:47,742 --> 01:01:49,869
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you can't clown me.

822
01:01:50,445 --> 01:01:51,844
Watch the kids.

823
01:01:52,681 --> 01:01:54,444
All of them?

824
01:01:59,254 --> 01:02:00,812
You little...

825
01:02:03,992 --> 01:02:05,482
Oh, my word.

826
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:08,094
Pie and cake and brownies and pie.

827
01:02:08,263 --> 01:02:09,662
You said "pie" twice.

828
01:02:09,831 --> 01:02:11,355
I like pie.

829
01:02:12,033 --> 01:02:14,024
Kevin, you know Mom would be upset...

830
01:02:14,202 --> 01:02:17,638
if we were even thinking
about trying any of these...

831
01:02:17,872 --> 01:02:19,897
chocolatey...

832
01:02:20,075 --> 01:02:21,736
creamy...

833
01:02:22,444 --> 01:02:24,139
delicious...

834
01:02:26,147 --> 01:02:28,411
Hey, I was gonna eat those brownies.

835
01:02:28,583 --> 01:02:30,574
What? Just take those.

836
01:02:30,752 --> 01:02:32,413
No, I want yours.

837
01:02:46,067 --> 01:02:47,398
Take it easy, man.

838
01:02:50,338 --> 01:02:51,737
Sorry.

839
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:13,491
Ridiculous.

840
01:03:13,661 --> 01:03:15,959
What? I got this.

841
01:03:21,269 --> 01:03:23,965
All right, timeout. Get off of him.

842
01:03:24,139 --> 01:03:26,334
Get off of him. Get out of here.

843
01:03:26,508 --> 01:03:29,068
Get off of him, you little gangsters.
Watch out.

844
01:03:29,477 --> 01:03:32,037
You too! Off of him!

845
01:03:32,213 --> 01:03:34,443
What is wrong with you kids?

846
01:03:34,616 --> 01:03:37,278
Why y'all ganging up on him?

847
01:03:37,719 --> 01:03:38,947
You think you so tough?

848
01:03:40,822 --> 01:03:43,347
I'd like to see you try that
with somebody my size.

849
01:03:46,928 --> 01:03:48,452
Okay! Okay, man!

850
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:51,064
All right, get off me, you little maggots!

851
01:03:51,833 --> 01:03:55,098
- Do you think we should help him?
- I'm getting mad now. Hey!

852
01:03:55,904 --> 01:03:57,565
- After this bite.
- Hey, that's it.

853
01:03:57,739 --> 01:03:59,866
Now, I'm gonna count to three.

854
01:04:01,009 --> 01:04:02,636
Hey, wait a minute!

855
01:04:02,811 --> 01:04:04,608
Okay! Get off!

856
01:04:04,779 --> 01:04:07,646
My shoe! Come back here with my shoe.

857
01:04:15,824 --> 01:04:18,349
All right, people,
it's time for some karaoke.

858
01:04:19,961 --> 01:04:21,326
What is she doing?

859
01:04:33,942 --> 01:04:35,307
She can sing?

860
01:04:49,023 --> 01:04:50,422
She can sing.

861
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:28,455
Kevin, enough. Kevin, please.

862
01:06:31,826 --> 01:06:35,387
I didn't know you could sing that good.
Why you didn't say nothing?

863
01:06:35,563 --> 01:06:37,929
Because before, you were the enemy.

864
01:06:38,499 --> 01:06:42,868
You know who can sing? Galaktico can sing.

865
01:06:44,405 --> 01:06:45,929
Hey.

866
01:06:46,107 --> 01:06:48,337
Okay. All right, okay, okay.

867
01:06:48,509 --> 01:06:51,307
Put that down, settle down
and put on your seat belt.

868
01:06:51,546 --> 01:06:53,844
I know why your mama
won't let you have sugar.

869
01:06:54,148 --> 01:06:56,946
Hyper down. You're like some kind
of crazy dog.

870
01:06:57,418 --> 01:07:00,979
I know you are, but what am I, Rover?

871
01:07:05,793 --> 01:07:08,557
Nick, I don't feel so good.

872
01:07:09,097 --> 01:07:11,429
Do you got anything to drink?

873
01:07:14,969 --> 01:07:16,561
There you go.

874
01:07:18,806 --> 01:07:23,140
I'm sorry, Nick, I accidentally
spilled a drop on the floor.

875
01:07:23,311 --> 01:07:25,609
Little man, don't even worry about it.

876
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:28,214
There's nothing more
that you can do to this car.

877
01:07:31,586 --> 01:07:32,848
Oh, no!

878
01:07:33,221 --> 01:07:36,156
I can't see. I can't see!

879
01:07:44,666 --> 01:07:46,725
Is everybody all right?

880
01:07:46,901 --> 01:07:49,802
I feel much better now.

881
01:07:53,574 --> 01:07:57,169
Nick, where are my kids? You were
supposed to be here two hours ago.

882
01:07:57,345 --> 01:07:59,370
We had a slight delay at the border.

883
01:07:59,547 --> 01:08:01,276
We're gonna need more paper towels.

884
01:08:01,449 --> 01:08:03,041
<i>Paper towels? What's going on?</i>

885
01:08:03,384 --> 01:08:06,376
Nothing. We just pulled over
to clean out the Navigator.

886
01:08:06,554 --> 01:08:07,816
Are you kidding me?

887
01:08:07,989 --> 01:08:11,755
It's freezing outside, and you've got
my kids cleaning your precious car?

888
01:08:11,926 --> 01:08:13,917
Suzanne, it's not like it seems, okay?

889
01:08:14,095 --> 01:08:15,926
<i>Well, it sounds pretty bad from here.</i>

890
01:08:16,497 --> 01:08:20,797
<i>Nick, if you're not here by 8:00,
you're gonna be in big trouble.</i>

891
01:08:21,135 --> 01:08:24,536
<i>- Suzanne, I got this.
- Eight o'clock, Nick.</i>

892
01:08:26,207 --> 01:08:29,608
All right, guys, we gotta hustle.
Your mom's getting worried.

893
01:08:29,777 --> 01:08:33,269
- But it stinks in here.
- Hold your breath.

894
01:08:33,915 --> 01:08:35,143
What?

895
01:08:35,316 --> 01:08:36,874
If we don't move...

896
01:08:37,051 --> 01:08:38,643
maybe it won't kill us.

897
01:08:41,389 --> 01:08:43,619
Oh, man, you're scared of that deer?

898
01:08:44,125 --> 01:08:46,389
He ain't gonna hurt you.

899
01:08:46,561 --> 01:08:49,997
They come out of the woods when
they get cold. He's probably hungry.

900
01:08:50,164 --> 01:08:51,631
Try this.

901
01:08:56,137 --> 01:09:01,006
- Hey. Look what I got.
- Nick, deers are herbivores.

902
01:09:01,175 --> 01:09:03,837
So what? Everybody loves chocolate chip.

903
01:09:05,179 --> 01:09:07,807
Hey, buddy, come on.

904
01:09:08,149 --> 01:09:10,344
Cookie.

905
01:09:12,687 --> 01:09:14,587
Okay, okay, hey, hey, come on.

906
01:09:15,223 --> 01:09:17,350
- No.
- What? He's not gonna hurt you.

907
01:09:17,792 --> 01:09:21,523
Look, I'm right here with you.
Come on, come on. Come on.

908
01:09:21,696 --> 01:09:23,527
Slow. Come on.

909
01:09:23,698 --> 01:09:26,258
Slowly. Don't scare it. Get in there.

910
01:09:26,434 --> 01:09:29,426
- What if he's rabid?
- Come on, come on. There we go.

911
01:09:29,604 --> 01:09:31,629
There you go. There you go.

912
01:09:32,173 --> 01:09:35,142
See, he's gentle. He's not gonna hurt you.

913
01:09:35,309 --> 01:09:36,970
- Give him another.
- No way.

914
01:09:37,145 --> 01:09:38,737
- Now, look.
- Where's my camera?

915
01:09:46,554 --> 01:09:48,419
Hey, hey. Hey.

916
01:09:50,158 --> 01:09:52,490
Down, boy. Sit.

917
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:54,560
Hey, Bambi. Sit!

918
01:09:57,165 --> 01:09:58,826
Come on, now.

919
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,695
Bambi.

920
01:10:02,670 --> 01:10:05,195
Give him the look, Nick!
Give him the look!

921
01:10:05,373 --> 01:10:07,739
All right, you want a piece of me?

922
01:10:13,147 --> 01:10:15,377
Say uncle. Are you done?

923
01:10:15,550 --> 01:10:17,518
Your head gotta go over my fireplace?

924
01:10:17,685 --> 01:10:20,518
- Show him who's boss, Nick.
- Now, just let it go.

925
01:10:20,688 --> 01:10:23,156
Let it go.

926
01:10:23,324 --> 01:10:26,350
Now, get your tail out of here
before I kick some deer butt.

927
01:10:26,527 --> 01:10:28,256
You better run.

928
01:10:33,401 --> 01:10:35,869
- I hope you got some nice shots.
- Yep.

929
01:10:36,304 --> 01:10:38,704
Now help me find my keys.

930
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:41,501
Come on out of there.

931
01:10:46,814 --> 01:10:48,372
If your mama ever asks...

932
01:10:48,549 --> 01:10:51,382
don't let her know
I know how to hot-wire a car.

933
01:10:51,686 --> 01:10:53,415
But you don't know how to do it.

934
01:10:53,821 --> 01:10:56,312
Quiet down out there.

935
01:10:56,490 --> 01:10:58,549
Have patience.

936
01:11:03,531 --> 01:11:05,897
- Turn it off, Nick!
- All right, calm down.

937
01:11:06,067 --> 01:11:08,968
- Hurry up. It's loud.
- And scary.

938
01:11:09,303 --> 01:11:11,168
This should do it.

939
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:22,144
- Nick, the car's on fire. It's burning.
- Oh, no.

940
01:11:22,550 --> 01:11:25,314
It's gonna burn. Nick, hurry.

941
01:11:25,486 --> 01:11:28,978
- Be careful.
- Come on, Nick, do it.

942
01:11:29,423 --> 01:11:30,822
Put it out! Put it out!

943
01:11:33,094 --> 01:11:35,824
It's gonna burn, Nick! Hurry!

944
01:11:35,997 --> 01:11:38,090
This could be toxic.

945
01:11:38,266 --> 01:11:40,063
Worthless.

946
01:11:40,234 --> 01:11:42,634
- Galaktico!
- Kevin, step back. I got it.

947
01:11:44,338 --> 01:11:47,273
Hey, Nick, don't forget me. I'm over here.

948
01:11:47,441 --> 01:11:49,170
I'm on the dashboard, remember?

949
01:11:49,343 --> 01:11:52,005
Hey! Don't let me burn!

950
01:11:52,179 --> 01:11:54,113
I'm a limited edition!

951
01:11:56,284 --> 01:12:00,015
Oh, man.
I never even got to read the manual.

952
01:12:10,631 --> 01:12:12,599
Hit the dirt!

953
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:27,705
Why?

954
01:12:28,549 --> 01:12:30,176
Oh, no.

955
01:12:31,786 --> 01:12:34,346
This is about a year's pay.

956
01:12:35,556 --> 01:12:37,387
What did I do?

957
01:12:37,558 --> 01:12:40,254
What did I do?
Why is this happening to me?

958
01:12:44,231 --> 01:12:45,630
It was you two.

959
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:48,963
If I didn't volunteer to babysit
you two little demons...

960
01:12:49,136 --> 01:12:52,469
this wouldn't have never happened,
and I'd still have my car.

961
01:12:55,876 --> 01:12:58,436
Go ahead and cry. I don't care.

962
01:13:03,417 --> 01:13:05,510
Okay, all right, stop the waterworks.

963
01:13:07,688 --> 01:13:10,851
Oh, all right. Oh, come on, come on.

964
01:13:11,625 --> 01:13:15,061
Stop crying. Stop crying.

965
01:13:15,229 --> 01:13:17,857
It's not your fault. It's not your fault.

966
01:13:18,032 --> 01:13:22,128
No, no. I just got a little upset, okay?

967
01:13:22,303 --> 01:13:24,271
That's why you buy insurance.

968
01:13:24,438 --> 01:13:27,066
All right, let's sit down. Sit down.
Come on, now.

969
01:13:27,241 --> 01:13:30,870
Right here, right here.
It's only a car, okay?

970
01:13:31,278 --> 01:13:33,303
We are a lot of trouble.

971
01:13:33,481 --> 01:13:36,382
That's why our daddy
doesn't wanna be with us.

972
01:13:36,617 --> 01:13:38,517
Whoa, whoa.

973
01:13:38,686 --> 01:13:40,483
Look at me.

974
01:13:40,654 --> 01:13:42,713
Don't say that. That's not true.

975
01:13:42,890 --> 01:13:44,790
But we destroyed your Navigator.

976
01:13:45,493 --> 01:13:48,951
That? Oh, that's nothing.

977
01:13:50,197 --> 01:13:53,064
That's just a material object.

978
01:13:53,634 --> 01:13:54,931
It means nothing.

979
01:13:55,102 --> 01:13:57,593
I wouldn't wanna spend New Year's
with us either.

980
01:13:58,205 --> 01:13:59,900
Who would?

981
01:14:01,909 --> 01:14:03,877
Me.

982
01:14:04,512 --> 01:14:06,070
I would.

983
01:14:07,615 --> 01:14:09,708
But you know what?

984
01:14:09,884 --> 01:14:12,375
Maybe your mother's right, you know.

985
01:14:12,553 --> 01:14:14,111
Maybe I'm not cut out for this.

986
01:14:14,422 --> 01:14:16,788
I mean, look at you two. You're a mess.

987
01:14:16,957 --> 01:14:20,222
I keep losing you,
feeding you the wrong stuff.

988
01:14:20,995 --> 01:14:24,089
If you were goldfish, you'd be dead.

989
01:14:25,066 --> 01:14:28,467
You know, you're doing okay.
This is just your first day.

990
01:14:28,769 --> 01:14:32,102
Yeah, you have to get experience.
You'll get used to it.

991
01:14:32,273 --> 01:14:34,639
Yeah, and there's books you can read too.

992
01:14:36,877 --> 01:14:38,435
Thanks.

993
01:14:38,612 --> 01:14:39,909
But you know what?

994
01:14:40,347 --> 01:14:42,781
If we're not magically in front
of your mother...

995
01:14:42,950 --> 01:14:44,941
in the next 30 minutes or so...

996
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:46,916
she'll never talk to me again.

997
01:14:47,088 --> 01:14:51,286
Hey, if it's the bottom of the ninth, and
you're down two runs, do you quit?

998
01:14:51,459 --> 01:14:55,293
No. You put that ball back on the tee,
and you keep swinging.

999
01:15:00,468 --> 01:15:02,561
Well, let's keep swinging.

1000
01:15:02,736 --> 01:15:05,762
Come on. Let's go.

1001
01:15:08,209 --> 01:15:11,872
Now we gotta figure out how
we gonna get to Vancouver.

1002
01:15:13,347 --> 01:15:16,248
Hey, look.

1003
01:15:16,417 --> 01:15:18,612
I found your keys, Nick.

1004
01:15:19,353 --> 01:15:21,184
What?

1005
01:15:21,355 --> 01:15:23,687
It's just my luck.

1006
01:15:32,133 --> 01:15:34,260
Let's get out of here.

1007
01:15:36,203 --> 01:15:38,603
- Come on.
- Right here, baby. Come on, now.

1008
01:15:41,775 --> 01:15:43,106
Yo, yo, yo, hey!

1009
01:15:43,878 --> 01:15:45,709
You got one.

1010
01:15:51,285 --> 01:15:52,684
Oh, man, thanks.

1011
01:15:52,853 --> 01:15:57,085
We're on our way to Vancouver,
and I really, really appreciate this.

1012
01:15:57,258 --> 01:15:59,749
I couldn't leave these kids
here on the highway.

1013
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:03,494
That's why I'm leaving you, you animal!

1014
01:16:04,165 --> 01:16:07,032
Wait a minute!
Come back here, you hillbilly!

1015
01:16:07,201 --> 01:16:08,566
Come here!

1016
01:16:09,803 --> 01:16:11,964
No. Let me in. Let...

1017
01:16:14,675 --> 01:16:18,202
Hey, yo, bring me back my kids!

1018
01:16:28,189 --> 01:16:29,679
Stop.

1019
01:16:32,026 --> 01:16:33,254
Mister, are you crazy?

1020
01:16:33,427 --> 01:16:36,191
Some psycho trucker took my kids.
We gotta catch him.

1021
01:16:36,363 --> 01:16:39,662
Well, hop aboard. I'll help you.
Ernst to the rescue.

1022
01:16:43,470 --> 01:16:47,065
Suzanne, they'll be here any minute.
I'm sure they're fine.

1023
01:16:47,241 --> 01:16:50,267
Now, let's concentrate on the party.

1024
01:17:00,921 --> 01:17:02,786
We were completely wrong about Nick.

1025
01:17:03,324 --> 01:17:07,658
Yeah, but now we know
he's kind and gentle.

1026
01:17:07,828 --> 01:17:11,787
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, slim, get me closer.

1027
01:17:11,966 --> 01:17:13,399
- Come on, Nick.
- I got it.

1028
01:17:13,567 --> 01:17:15,000
- Get off.
- Open up, you jerk.

1029
01:17:15,169 --> 01:17:16,796
Nick, save us! Help!

1030
01:17:16,971 --> 01:17:18,404
- Stop this truck!
- Get off!

1031
01:17:18,572 --> 01:17:20,904
- You lunatic!
- Stop this truck!

1032
01:17:22,943 --> 01:17:24,968
Kind and gentle, huh?

1033
01:17:28,315 --> 01:17:30,010
- Go, man.
- I'm moving.

1034
01:17:30,184 --> 01:17:32,084
This thing wasn't built for speed.

1035
01:17:36,023 --> 01:17:38,184
Come on, you're driving like a old lady.

1036
01:17:38,359 --> 01:17:41,157
No, no, you watch.
Ernst knows how to drive.

1037
01:17:47,101 --> 01:17:48,830
That's what I'm talking about.

1038
01:17:49,003 --> 01:17:51,403
- Let us out now.
- We wanna go with Nick.

1039
01:17:51,572 --> 01:17:53,301
Let us out.

1040
01:17:54,708 --> 01:17:58,542
Come on, slim, don't let him
push you around. Do it. Do it.

1041
01:18:01,715 --> 01:18:04,377
Dag-bernit, I've had enough of this.

1042
01:18:13,294 --> 01:18:16,457
- Come on, slim, they getting away.
- It won't turn over.

1043
01:18:17,998 --> 01:18:20,489
I can't do anything about it.

1044
01:18:20,668 --> 01:18:21,999
I'm sorry.

1045
01:18:24,505 --> 01:18:27,838
Boy, it's true. Never a cop around
when you need one.

1046
01:18:30,577 --> 01:18:32,238
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

1047
01:18:37,618 --> 01:18:38,812
Bad! Hit you!

1048
01:18:46,193 --> 01:18:47,353
- Geronimo!
- Geronimo!

1049
01:18:52,166 --> 01:18:54,794
- Look, it's Elite Catering.
- This is Mom's party.

1050
01:18:54,968 --> 01:18:56,435
Let's go.

1051
01:19:07,915 --> 01:19:09,940
- Come on.
- I want some cotton candy.

1052
01:19:10,384 --> 01:19:12,511
- Got you.
- Run! Save yourself!

1053
01:19:13,620 --> 01:19:15,247
Wait. Wait.

1054
01:19:15,422 --> 01:19:17,390
At least slow down.

1055
01:19:20,694 --> 01:19:23,060
You two are a peck of trouble,
you know that?

1056
01:19:28,602 --> 01:19:30,763
Wait. I'm trying to protect you.

1057
01:19:31,505 --> 01:19:33,939
You're going down, sucker.

1058
01:19:35,109 --> 01:19:36,906
Get off me.

1059
01:19:52,259 --> 01:19:54,056
Come on. Come on.

1060
01:19:56,730 --> 01:19:59,130
I'm gonna give you a knuckle sandwich.

1061
01:20:01,301 --> 01:20:04,634
- Let me at him. Get your hands off me.
- What's wrong with you two?

1062
01:20:04,905 --> 01:20:06,770
- He's a kidnapper!
- He's a kidnapper!

1063
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:08,771
- He's a kidnapper!
- He's a kidnapper!

1064
01:20:08,942 --> 01:20:11,604
- Let me at him.
- Yeah. Nick, get him!

1065
01:20:11,779 --> 01:20:12,939
Police.

1066
01:20:25,259 --> 01:20:27,090
Mom!

1067
01:20:27,261 --> 01:20:29,923
Lindsey, honey.

1068
01:20:30,097 --> 01:20:34,227
Oh, baby, Mommy was so worried
about you. Are you okay?

1069
01:20:34,401 --> 01:20:37,199
Yep. Eight o'clock, just like you said.

1070
01:20:37,371 --> 01:20:39,532
Now, where is your brother and that Nick?

1071
01:20:40,808 --> 01:20:42,673
I left them by the ice-skating rink.

1072
01:20:42,843 --> 01:20:46,609
Now, I need to know what's going
on here, and I want the truth.

1073
01:20:47,281 --> 01:20:51,877
The truth? I don't think there's time
for the truth.

1074
01:20:58,292 --> 01:20:59,691
Get him!

1075
01:20:59,860 --> 01:21:01,623
I'm the good guy. Get him.

1076
01:21:02,095 --> 01:21:04,859
Get your hands off me,
you stinking snowman.

1077
01:21:06,099 --> 01:21:07,862
Wait a minute. You don't understand.

1078
01:21:08,035 --> 01:21:12,972
I got permission from his mother
to bring him here. Kevin, tell him.

1079
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:15,165
Kevin!

1080
01:21:21,682 --> 01:21:23,650
Let me go. He needs his inhaler.

1081
01:21:24,418 --> 01:21:25,908
Kevin. Kevin.

1082
01:21:26,086 --> 01:21:28,247
Oh, no. Come on, man.

1083
01:21:28,422 --> 01:21:30,253
Come on, Kevin.

1084
01:21:30,424 --> 01:21:32,255
Come on, man. Breathe.

1085
01:21:32,426 --> 01:21:34,257
Breathe, breathe.

1086
01:21:34,561 --> 01:21:36,756
Come on. Come on, breathe.

1087
01:21:37,130 --> 01:21:39,098
Kevin.

1088
01:21:40,434 --> 01:21:42,334
Kevin.

1089
01:21:48,175 --> 01:21:51,235
Don't you ever scare me
like that again. You hear me?

1090
01:21:51,912 --> 01:21:54,073
Don't you ever do that.

1091
01:21:54,248 --> 01:21:57,877
Maybe it won't be so bad
to turn out like you after all.

1092
01:22:00,053 --> 01:22:01,486
Kevin!

1093
01:22:01,655 --> 01:22:04,852
- Mommy.
- Oh, Kevin, honey, come here.

1094
01:22:05,025 --> 01:22:08,119
I don't know what Mommy was
thinking. I should've come home.

1095
01:22:08,295 --> 01:22:10,593
- Are you okay?
- It's okay, Mom. I'm fine.

1096
01:22:10,764 --> 01:22:12,231
Yeah, it's okay. He's fine.

1097
01:22:13,066 --> 01:22:14,761
You call this fine?

1098
01:22:14,935 --> 01:22:17,096
Look at this. This is a catastrophe.

1099
01:22:17,271 --> 01:22:19,000
No, Suzanne, you don't understand.

1100
01:22:19,172 --> 01:22:22,073
- I mean, we... Me and the kids...
- Nick, please.

1101
01:22:22,242 --> 01:22:23,903
It's bad enough as it is.

1102
01:22:27,814 --> 01:22:30,044
I really wanted to believe in you.

1103
01:22:32,119 --> 01:22:35,577
Ma'am, did this man have permission
to watch your children?

1104
01:22:40,394 --> 01:22:42,294
Yes.

1105
01:22:43,897 --> 01:22:46,764
But it was a mistake,
and it won't happen again.

1106
01:22:53,740 --> 01:22:55,173
Come on, you guys.

1107
01:22:55,709 --> 01:22:57,233
- Suzanne, no.
- But, Mom...

1108
01:22:57,411 --> 01:23:00,505
I don't wanna hear it.
I'm not in the mood to argue. Let's go.

1109
01:23:00,681 --> 01:23:02,410
- Mommy.
- Let's go.

1110
01:23:02,583 --> 01:23:04,175
Suzanne.

1111
01:23:13,427 --> 01:23:14,826
Nick.

1112
01:23:15,729 --> 01:23:17,424
Listen...

1113
01:23:17,898 --> 01:23:20,128
I'm sorry for all the trouble.

1114
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:24,930
If you're serious about heading home,
I'd be proud to give you a lift.

1115
01:23:25,839 --> 01:23:27,466
Appreciate that, Big Al.

1116
01:23:27,641 --> 01:23:29,632
I got my truck right...

1117
01:23:30,277 --> 01:23:34,304
Hey, what are you doing, you turkey?
You can't tow my truck!

1118
01:23:34,481 --> 01:23:37,382
Put it down. I'm here.
Put it down right now.

1119
01:23:37,551 --> 01:23:39,212
Officers, arrest this man!

1120
01:23:47,394 --> 01:23:49,191
Yo, Nick.

1121
01:23:49,696 --> 01:23:51,288
Excuse me.

1122
01:23:51,465 --> 01:23:52,693
Hey, Nick, remember me?

1123
01:23:52,866 --> 01:23:55,630
I'm in here with a mint stuck to my head.

1124
01:23:56,203 --> 01:23:57,534
Hey, brother.

1125
01:23:57,704 --> 01:24:01,470
What are you moping about?
You should be celebrating.

1126
01:24:01,642 --> 01:24:04,270
You finally got rid
of that highfalutin woman...

1127
01:24:04,444 --> 01:24:07,743
with that smart-mouth little girl
and that sickly boy.

1128
01:24:08,782 --> 01:24:12,980
Yes, sir. It's New Year's Eve,
and you are free at last.

1129
01:24:13,153 --> 01:24:15,087
Time to hit some clubs.

1130
01:24:15,589 --> 01:24:18,649
And they got some foxy ladies here.

1131
01:24:18,825 --> 01:24:21,316
Did you know Vancouver
produces more Playmates...

1132
01:24:21,495 --> 01:24:23,554
than any other city in the world?

1133
01:24:23,730 --> 01:24:25,561
Let's go, player.

1134
01:24:42,683 --> 01:24:45,413
Thanks, Dad, that was a lot of fun.

1135
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:21,415
Hey, Nick.

1136
01:25:21,588 --> 01:25:23,988
You know what they call
a 50-year-old bachelor?

1137
01:25:24,491 --> 01:25:25,890
What?

1138
01:25:26,059 --> 01:25:27,720
Lonely.

1139
01:25:50,517 --> 01:25:52,382
Who is it?

1140
01:25:53,086 --> 01:25:54,314
Room service.

1141
01:25:56,490 --> 01:25:58,958
We didn't order anything,
and that won't change.

1142
01:25:59,326 --> 01:26:01,317
Let me explain, okay?

1143
01:26:01,495 --> 01:26:05,226
I know you're upset,
and you have a right to be...

1144
01:26:05,398 --> 01:26:08,424
- but there's a good reason why all...
- Nick, they're kids.

1145
01:26:08,602 --> 01:26:11,298
They don't need reasons and excuses.
They need a man.

1146
01:26:11,605 --> 01:26:14,597
So whatever it is that you have to say,
just drop it.

1147
01:26:14,775 --> 01:26:18,006
I've been down this road before,
and I'm not going back.

1148
01:26:18,178 --> 01:26:20,339
- Good night.
- Wait, wait.

1149
01:26:22,883 --> 01:26:25,283
Just let me say goodbye to the kids.

1150
01:26:26,353 --> 01:26:28,014
I don't think that's a good idea.

1151
01:26:30,290 --> 01:26:31,655
Please.

1152
01:26:37,898 --> 01:26:39,365
Make it quick.

1153
01:26:41,034 --> 01:26:42,729
- Nick!
- Nick!

1154
01:26:42,903 --> 01:26:46,600
Hey, how you guys doing? You all right?

1155
01:26:46,773 --> 01:26:50,038
I knew you'd come back.
Lindsey didn't think so, but I did.

1156
01:26:50,210 --> 01:26:53,373
Boy, you know I'm gonna be
your friend always, right?

1157
01:26:53,547 --> 01:26:57,210
But Mama's not gonna date you anymore.

1158
01:26:57,684 --> 01:26:58,878
Listen, you guys.

1159
01:27:01,054 --> 01:27:03,022
Up here.

1160
01:27:05,592 --> 01:27:09,995
Your mother is a very,
very wonderful lady.

1161
01:27:10,964 --> 01:27:14,593
And she's gonna be dating guys
that are much better than me.

1162
01:27:14,768 --> 01:27:18,670
So you guys gotta stop
chasing them off, okay?

1163
01:27:18,839 --> 01:27:21,000
And stay away from their cars.

1164
01:27:21,174 --> 01:27:23,005
Unless they're bulletproof.

1165
01:27:26,279 --> 01:27:29,680
How do I know we'll ever see you again?

1166
01:27:31,318 --> 01:27:33,286
I got something for you.

1167
01:27:33,787 --> 01:27:38,724
I want you to hold on
to my man Satch, okay?

1168
01:27:39,092 --> 01:27:41,925
That's until I see you again.

1169
01:27:43,163 --> 01:27:44,892
All right...

1170
01:27:45,065 --> 01:27:46,430
I gotta get going.

1171
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:49,228
Do you have to?

1172
01:27:49,402 --> 01:27:52,200
Yeah, little man, I think so.

1173
01:27:52,806 --> 01:27:55,798
Look, I got one more thing for you.

1174
01:28:00,180 --> 01:28:02,410
There you go.

1175
01:28:03,683 --> 01:28:05,810
And for you.

1176
01:28:06,586 --> 01:28:09,180
Now you have blingage.

1177
01:28:11,825 --> 01:28:14,055
I love you guys.

1178
01:28:19,432 --> 01:28:21,900
See you later, okay?

1179
01:28:22,068 --> 01:28:23,660
All right.

1180
01:28:29,009 --> 01:28:32,775
Suzanne, I'm sorry about
what happened today.

1181
01:28:32,946 --> 01:28:35,039
I really am.

1182
01:28:35,882 --> 01:28:38,248
I just wanna know if
we can still be friends.

1183
01:28:39,085 --> 01:28:41,417
Nick, I don't think that's gonna happen.

1184
01:28:45,058 --> 01:28:47,083
Okay.

1185
01:28:49,062 --> 01:28:50,825
Nick?

1186
01:28:51,965 --> 01:28:54,126
We can't be friends...

1187
01:28:55,468 --> 01:28:58,995
