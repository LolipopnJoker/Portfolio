Fred, before you go... (GRUNTS)

00:52:00,621 --> 00:52:03,123
Would you mind chipping your "X"
on a couple of these?

851
00:52:03,207 --> 00:52:04,666
Yeah, sure. What are they?

852
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:07,294
Well, you sign these
and your buddies down in the quarry

853
00:52:07,377 --> 00:52:09,213

854
00:52:09,379 --> 00:52:13,759

all those memos I been sendin' in.

who's to thank for this.

858
00:52:26,688 --> 00:52:30,275
(GRUNTS) Mr. Flintstone,
up to now our relationship

859
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:33,111
has not been based on mutuality
of admiration or respect.

860
00:52:33,237 --> 00:52:34,279
Huh?

861
00:52:34,363 --> 00:52:37,699
Put simply, you hate my bird guts
and I think you're dumber than mud.

862
00:52:37,741 --> 00:52:41,870
-Ah. Well, good night.
-Still, I wish to pass on an old dictum...

863
00:52:42,037 --> 00:52:43,914
From business school
that may be apropos here.

Excuse me. I'm the executive,
you're the office equipment.

866
00:52:50,963 --> 00:52:53,882

the office equipment for advice,

No, thank you, Fred.
I'll wait till Barney gets here.

He started some new job today.
I'm not sure what time he gets done.

I'll get you a fresh tablecloth, sir.

he'd never find a job and

we'd be stuck with him forever.

Fred, did you hear what happened
to everyone at the quarry today?

917
00:55:52,311 --> 00:55:55,939
Yup. A few hours ago,
I sent them all off on a nice, long vacation.

918
00:55:56,148 --> 00:55:59,109
You mean, a permanent vacation.
He fired them!

Who are you going to believe,
me or some busboy?

923
00:56:09,077 --> 00:56:11,788
That busboy is
your best friend!

924
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:15,834
Best friend? I lost my best friend
the day I became an executive!

925
00:56:15,918 --> 00:56:18,629
He's just jealous
of my hard-earned success.

926
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:22,591
Hard-earned? Tell me something,
Mr. Vice President,

927
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:25,427
what's a graduated
inventory plan, huh?

928
00:56:25,469 --> 00:56:27,471
How about supply and demand?

929

Hey, Fred!
What's two and two?

930
00:56:31,558 --> 00:56:35,771
I didn't come here to talk business.
I'm out with my wife.

931
00:56:35,938 --> 00:56:38,148
Now,
get me a clean spoon.

932
00:56:38,649 --> 00:56:39,983
That does it!

933
00:56:40,901 --> 00:56:45,656
The only reason you got that job
is 'cause I switched tests with you.

934
00:56:45,822 --> 00:56:49,743
-Oh, Barney.
-Oh-ho-ho, that's rich!

935
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:54,831
What good would it do me to switch tests
with the guy that got the lowest score?

936
00:56:54,998 --> 00:57:00,045
-Think about it, Fred.
-Oh, finally it all makes sense.

937
00:57:00,212 --> 00:57:02,339
You don't believe this, do you?

938
00:57:02,506 --> 00:57:04,800
Are you calling my husband a liar?

939
00:57:04,967 --> 00:57:06,760
This has gone far enough.

940
00:57:06,927 --> 00:57:11,682
After everything that we've done for you.
We took you into our home.

have you lost your mind?

01:24:43,417 --> 01:24:46,837
Let's ride with the family down the street

1343
01:24:47,004 --> 01:24:50,299
Through the courtesy
of Fred's two feet

1344
01:24:50,465 --> 01:24:52,968
When you're with the Flintstones

1345
01:24:53,135 --> 01:24:57,222
Have a yabba-dabba-doo time
A dabba-doo time

1346
01:24:57,389 --> 01:25:00,726
We'll have a gay old time

1347
01:25:07,941 --> 01:25:11,028
(DINO BARKING)

1348
01:25:40,849 --> 01:25:43,810
MAN: The Flintstones!

1349
01:25:45,229 --> 01:25:48,023
Flintstones
Meet the Flintstones

1350
01:25:48,190 --> 01:25:51,944
They're the modern
Stone Age family

1351
01:25:52,110 --> 01:25:54,738
From the
town of Bedrock

1352
01:25:54,905 --> 01:25:58,825
They're a page
right out of history

1353
01:25:58,992 --> 01:26:02,371
Someday maybe
Fred will win the fight

1354
01:26:02,538 --> 01:26:05,624
Then that cat will
stay out for the night

1355
01:26:05,791 --> 01:26:08,377
When you're
with the Flintstones

1356
01:26:08,544 --> 01:26:12,673
Have a yabba-dabba-doo time
A dabba-doo time

1357
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:16,260
We'll have a gay old time

1358
01:26:23,267 --> 01:26:28,313
We'll have a gay old time

1359
01:26:30,941 --> 01:26:33,026
Yeah!

1360
01:26:37,447 --> 01:26:38,949
Yabba-dabba-doo!

1361
01:26:39,116 --> 01:26:41,743
I was travelin' to Earth
and what did I spot

1362
01:26:41,910 --> 01:26:44,246
A little village by the water
Sign said Bedrock

1363
01:26:44,413 --> 01:26:46,915
I met this kid named Fred
He didn't wear no socks

1364
01:26:47,082 --> 01:26:49,585
He had a part-time gig
at the Gravel Pit slingin' rocks

1365
01:26:49,751 --> 01:26:52,671
Said he was into hip hop
Could he kick a spell I told him go for it

1366
01:26:52,838 --> 01:26:55,549
But at first said what you think
I said you're style is prehistoric

1367
01:26:55,716 --> 01:26:58,594
Sounds stuck in the Stone Age
You're still using a hammer and chisel

1368
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:00,554
Carving out your lyrics
on stone pages

1369
01:27:00,721 --> 01:27:03,891
It's about time you heard a style from a real
before-the-wheel rapper

1370
01:27:04,057 --> 01:27:06,476
Set it off and he said yabba-dabba-doo

1371
01:27:06,643 --> 01:27:08,770
Then he got to prove
The fella's suddenly standing

1372
01:27:08,937 --> 01:27:10,772
In the middle of a crowd of K drummers

1373
01:27:10,939 --> 01:27:13,150
Sayin' tell us how you flipped
the script and ripped

1374
01:27:13,317 --> 01:27:16,320
I get busy one time They said yeah
yeah I'm hip, I'm hip

1375
01:27:16,486 --> 01:27:18,322
Didn't know the time
Didn't know about fly

1376
01:27:18,488 --> 01:27:22,034
So I, you know, I had to show
a Cave Man how to rock

1377
01:27:24,870 --> 01:27:27,581
In the Stone Age

1378
01:27:27,748 --> 01:27:29,708
I showed a Cave Man
how to rock

1379
01:27:29,875 --> 01:27:33,212
Yabba-dabba-doo!

1380
01:27:35,714 --> 01:27:38,217
In the Stone Age

1381
01:27:38,383 --> 01:27:40,344
I showed a Cave Man
how to rock

1382
01:27:40,511 --> 01:27:43,555
Yabba-dabba-doo!

1383
01:27:50,187 --> 01:27:53,941
Barney Rubble
Fred Flintstone

1384
01:27:57,444 --> 01:28:00,739
Hey, Freddie boy
Don't try to get too close

1385
01:28:00,906 --> 01:28:04,701
I don't want to catch
a man with those

1386
01:28:07,204 --> 01:28:10,207
We'll meet at
the Bedrock disco

1387
01:28:10,290 --> 01:28:13,418
Who cares that I got T. Rex

1388
01:28:13,544 --> 01:28:15,796
On my radio

1389
01:28:16,547 --> 01:28:22,052
On this prehistoric day
I feel duty-bound to say

1390
01:28:22,511 --> 01:28:27,057
Before I reach
my destination

1391
01:28:27,224 --> 01:28:32,563
On this prehistoric day
I feel duty-bound to say

1392
01:28:32,729 --> 01:28:37,401
I owes an explanation

1393
01:28:37,568 --> 01:28:40,696
Give me one good reason

1394
01:28:42,573 --> 01:28:46,034
Give me two good reasons

1395
01:28:47,661 --> 01:28:50,789
Give me three good reasons

1396
01:28:50,956 --> 01:28:55,252
Why's men do what they do

1397
01:28:58,422 --> 01:29:02,217
Yabba-dabba-doo Yabba-dabba-doo
Yabba-dabba-doo

1398
01:29:06,597 --> 01:29:09,766
Anarchy in Bedrock

1399
01:29:09,933 --> 01:29:13,395
Stop in some time
and meet Betty and Wilma

1400
01:29:13,562 --> 01:29:16,815
Try some Flint upside-down
Rubble bubble cake

1401
01:29:16,982 --> 01:29:19,902
Or just try
Fruity Pebbles

1402
01:29:20,068 --> 01:29:22,821
'Cause I

1403
01:29:22,988 --> 01:29:26,116
Wanna be

1404
01:29:26,283 --> 01:29:28,744
Fred Flintstone

1405
01:29:30,746 --> 01:29:33,999
Is this the U.S.D.A.

1406
01:29:34,166 --> 01:29:37,461
Is this Hollywood

1407
01:29:37,628 --> 01:29:40,756
Is this Bedrock

1408
01:29:40,923 --> 01:29:44,218
I thought it was Hollyrock

1409
01:29:44,384 --> 01:29:46,678
'Cause I

1410
01:29:46,845 --> 01:29:50,265
Wanna be

1411
01:29:50,432 --> 01:29:52,809
Fred Flintstone

1412
01:29:55,312 --> 01:29:58,941
Yabba-dabba-doo

1413
01:30:04,905 --> 01:30:07,491
