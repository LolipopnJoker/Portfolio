Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius (2001) (1CD Subtitle - 23,976fps - English)

2
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,160
you better have a look at this, sir.

3
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,240
- Commercial flight. - No. Too fast, sir.

4
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,400
- One of our own?. - Air Force has nothing scheduled.

5
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,280
We've got ourselves a bogie.

6
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,080
Orange Leader to Delta Group. Anticipate visual contact...

7
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,280
now.

8
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,160
Holy cow pie!.

9
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,640
Hi! Nice antiques.

10
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,560
Gotta blast!

11
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,880
Fusion mix stable, engine cycling at one million giga joules.

12
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,800
Cool! We didn't blow up.

13
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,080
Great! Jimmy, I think they want us to pull over.

14
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,840
Nope. No time for that, Carl. Stand by with the satellite.

15
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,320
Okay. What do I do again?.

16
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,120
you're the deployment system, Carl.

17
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,000
As soon as we clear the atmosphere, you just throw it.

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,400
- Right. - Prepare to leave the atmosphere!

19
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,280
Sorry about the toast, dear. I had to make it in the oven.

20
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,240
- I can't find our toaster anywhere. - Oh, looky!

21
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,960
Well, this oven toast is brilliant, sugar booger.

22
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,760
And your yolks are absolutely perfect too.

23
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,160
Oh, run away with me, my love.

24
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,200
We'll take my car. your transmission needs a new compression cuff.

25
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,640
Whatever. Ooh, this is a good one. Quack, quack.

26
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,160
Would you try calling Jimmy?. He's going to miss the bus again.

27
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,000
Jimmy! Breakfast! Time to come down!

28
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,960
Down. down. down. down. down. quackk Down. down. down. down. down. quackk

29
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,960
Up, up, up!

30
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,640
Engaging pulse rockets now!

31
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,680
- No! - Now?.

32
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,360
Is this supposed to happen?.

33
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,840
Come on. think. think. think!

34
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,480
Brain blast!

35
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,920
Give me your lunch!

36
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,840
Thanks, boy.

37
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,360
Don't try that at home.

38
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,080
Must engage stabilizers!

39
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,040
Now just a quick stop at my house.

40
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,360
I don't know, Jimmy. I gotta get to school on time. Besides, you pro--

41
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,480
- Right. Gotcha. - I didn't mean--

42
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,240
See you in homeroom!

43
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,680
Fasten your seat belt, Goddard. It's gonna be a bumpy ride!

44
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,040
Well, what do you know. The chimney fell off again.

45
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,920
That wasn't so bad, huh?.

46
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,000
James Isaac Neutron!

47
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I see you up there.

48
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,440
How many times have we told you not to launch yourself off the roof?.

49
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,400
Probably nine. Exactly nine.

50
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,880
They say repetition is good for a developing brain.

51
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,680
Then just what do you think youâ€™re doing?.

52
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,320
I received a message from space but it was garbled in the ionosphere...

53
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,040
so I had to launch a communications toaster-- I mean satellite.

54
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,920
Well, message from space?. Wow!

55
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,040
Don't encourage him, Hugh.

56
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,280
Jimmy, we've repeatedly told you not to talk to strangers.

57
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,840
Mom, I'm on the verge of contact with an advanced alien civilization.

58
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,080
I don't care how advanced they say they are, Jimmy.

59
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,840
If your father and I haven't met them, they're strangers, right?.

60
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,200
Well, except for policemen. They're there to help you.

61
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,440
Oh, you gotta admit that is pretty neat!

62
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,360
But very unsafe, honey. That's bad.

63
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,800
Deactivate pants!

64
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,400
Engage Gingivitis 2000.

65
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,480
Robo-Barber prototype, engage!

66
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,840
On-line.

67
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,240
Ta-da.

68
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,840
You rock.

69
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,240
You go. girl.

70
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,920
Shoe-bot!

71
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,520
- Oh. - Sorry.

72
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,520
Bye, Goddard!

73
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,440
- Wait! I'm here! - Good-bye, son! Have a good day!

74
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,280
Oh, Goddard! Not on the porch!

75
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,200
Hey! Hey, wait!

76
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,960
Seems like the perfect opportunity to try out the bubble gum mobile!

77
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,320
No, Jimmy, don't try it! It's too soon.

78
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,280
Nonsense! All great inventions need a test run.

79
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,880
All right!

80
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,120
- Right here! - Look! Neutron's got another one.

81
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,160
Nice invention, Nerdtron.

82
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,880
Too bad somebody already invented the bus.

83
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,280
Hey, guys! I've got it down this time.

84
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,760
Internal combustion is such old science.

85
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,920
Bubble travel is the way of the future!

86
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,880
I guess trees are, like, the brakes?.

87
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,880
Hello. Jimmy!

88
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,720
Oh, Carl.

89
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,440
Careful! Careful!

90
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,600
Thanks.

91
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,000
That's what I'm here for.

92
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,080
- What a day, huh?. - Look at the bright side, Carl:

93
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,240
The worst is behind us.

94
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,960
And my fossil-to-chromosome ratios clearly demonstrate...

95
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,840
that female dinosaurs, like this plesiosaurus...

96
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,440
were the stronger and smarter of their species.

97
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,920
But, so, what else is new?.

98
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,560
After class, I'll be happy to demonstrate how boy dinosaurs...

99
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,680
got their butts kicked by girl dinosaurs on a regular basis.

100
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,520
Excuse me, but the mandible crest of Cindy's alleged plesiosaur...

101
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,360
is actually that of a male megalosaur...

102
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,240
as defined by last week's World Congress of Palaeontologists.

103
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,840
Those findings were inconclusive, and you know it, Neutron!

104
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,240
Miss Fowl, what is the standard for research...

105
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,360
on these extra-credit reports?.

106
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,800
Um, yes, well, um--

107
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,880
Let's move along to show-and-tell now, shall we?.

108
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,000
This is Ultra Lord!

109
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,440
Sheen...

110
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:56,240
this is the seventh week in a row you've shown Ultra Lord in class.

111
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,000
Miss Fowl, this one is different.

112
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,560
This Purple Vengeance version with power fists and nuclear knees...

113
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,680
is in rare, never-been-seen condition...

114
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,160
making it highly collectible.

115
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,800
Never-been-seen, huh?. Then how do you know it's even in there?.

116
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,120
Hey, Jimmy. Wanna see a frog?.

117
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,280
That looks great!

118
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,560
Thanks. What are you drawing?.

119
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,600
FlyCycle modifications for Goddard, second prototype.

120
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,160
Prototype, huh?.

121
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,360
Oh, well, you know, that looks good too.

122
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,480
- Thanks, Carl. - Carl!

123
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,800
Would you please share with us your show-and-tell?.

124
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,120
Oh, okay.

125
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,000
This is my inhaler.

126
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,320
It provides fast-acting relief of bronchial swelling...

127
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,720
due to asthma or allergies.

128
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,000
One touch of the button, and--

129
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,080
I can't see!

130
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,080
Thank you, Carl.

131
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,960
All right, next we have--

132
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,640
Nick!

133
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,880
yes, Nick.

134
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,880
you are a tad tardy again!

135
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,280
Oh, my. Am I?.

136
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,280
It took me a while to copy my mom's handwriting for this late note.

137
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,600
your show-and-tell, please.

138
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,720
How's it going'?. you know, I don't really do show-and-tell.

139
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,200
Oh, oh, yes. That's right.

140
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,720
Thank you, Nick.

141
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,160
Did you drop this?.

142
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,400
yes, well, I, um-- My-- drop-- pencil.

143
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,800
We eagerly await another one of your...

144
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,240
interesting show-and-tells.

145
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,480
As a matter of fact, I brought my latest invention.

146
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,760
Behold the shrink ray!

147
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,400
What's the matter, Neutron-- aren't you short enough already?.

148
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,880
Funny, Cindy.

149
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,760
But this device is more suited to shrink something...

150
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,520
as vast as space itself like, say, your mouth.

151
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,160
Help me! Help me! I'm so tiny!

152
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,040
Just like Jimmy's brain!

153
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,840
So much for the Nobel Prize!

154
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,400
- Children, that's enough! - Better luck next time!

155
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,760
It worked this morning.

156
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,280
I like your useless shrink ray, Jimmy.

157
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,960
It's probably just

158
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,800
Oh, my!

159
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,000
Back, back, leviathan!

160
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,480
Come on, Jimmy. Some of the greatest inventors of all time...
Come on, Jimmy. Some of the greatest inventors of all time...

161
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,760
started as complete, hopeless failures too.

162
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,080
Well, thank you, Carl. I feel better, I think.

163
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,880
- I'm glad. - That's good. Hey!

164
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,840
RetroLand Theme Park! Check it out!

165
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,720
Meet UltraLord live!

166
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,480
Look! It's the state-of-the-art, bone-warping gravity ride!

167
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,480
- I could hang out with UltraLord! - And there's a petting zoo!

168
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,640
- Well, look at this! - No! Meet UltraLord live!

169
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,200
Llamas and capybaras.

170
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,600
- Who cares?. Meet UltraLord live! - But I'm gonna touch a llama!

171
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,240
Guys, we have got to go to the grand opening tonight.

172
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,680
yeah!

173
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,200
yeah.

174
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,080
But my folks won't let me stay out after dark.

175
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,480
Well, it is a school night.

176
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,880
Pukin' Pluto, there's gotta be something we can do.

177
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,800
It's the grand opening!

178
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,440
- Sneak out. - What?.

179
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,640
you heard me, dweebs. Sneak out.

180
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,080
Well, yeah, but my parents sorta told me--

181
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,840
Parents?. What-- are you guys gonna be kids forever?.

182
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,040
What your parents don't know won't hurt 'em, right?.

183
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,720
But Nick, sneaking out is so, so barbaric!

184
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,280
Whatever, Neutron. But there's only one opening night...

185
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,400
and anybody who matters is gonna be there.

186
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,200
What do you think, Jimmy?.

187
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,960
Nick has a point. There is only one opening night.

188
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,080
Think, think, think.

189
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,320
Well, according to the Newville Journal of Medicine...

190
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,480
monkeys are easily influenced by positive reinforcement...

191
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,800
e.g., the giving of a banana.

192
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,040
And, since human and monkey DNA only differ by two percent...

193
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,280
the same principle should work on our parents.

194
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,360
My dad's allergic to bananas.

195
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,160
Oh, it's not the bananas, it's the principle!

196
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,480
It's called psychology. All you have to do is butter 'em up.

197
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,040
Give it a try. I'll call you guys later.

198
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,720
We go to RetroLand tonight!

199
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,880
Look out!

200
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,960
Slow down!

201
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,240
I know!

202
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,080
Excuse me! you through with that?. Thanks!

203
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,440
A few oysters.

204
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,520
One lump of coal coming up!

205
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,720
- Thanks, Gus! - Hi, Jimmy!

206
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,960
Excuse me!

207
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,880
Jimmy, is that you, dear?.

208
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:06,040
yeah, Mom! I'll be in, in a second!

209
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,760
DNA match confirmed. Welcome home. Jimmy.

210
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,960
Eliminate school smell.

211
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,360
Normal odour restored.

212
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,320
- Thank you, Vox. - You're welcome.

213
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,280
Warning. Entry tube closed for maintenance.

214
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,120
- Thank you, Vox. - You're welcome.

215
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,000
Here, Goddard. Here, boy!

216
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,000
Here, Goddard!

217
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,440
Hey, look what I brought ya-- aluminium!

218
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,960
Do you want it?. Do you want it, huh?.

219
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,720
Sit!

220
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,640
Roll over!

221
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,200
Play dead!

222
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,520
Mental note: Fix bug in obedience program.

223
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,720
Good boy!

224
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,760
Okay, Goddard, let's check the experiments.

225
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,400
The invisible hamsters are looking great.

226
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,280
I think.

227
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,560
Let's see how the girl-eating plant is doing.

228
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,440
Nice choice...

229
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,360
as usual.

230
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,200
The latest burping soda formula.

231
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,440
A guaranteed one burp per sip.

232
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,000
Excuse you.

233
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,200
There's still no reply to our satellite message.

234
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,120
Jeez, it's been a whole day.

235
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,360
you'd think we would have heard from an alien civilization by now, huh?.

236
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,240
Oh, well. Come on, Goddard.

237
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,400
Say ahh.

238
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,400
Add a little sand...

239
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,960
and in ya go!

240
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,080
Iâ€™m just an old lump of coal

241
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,400
But I'm gonna be a diamond some day Oh. yeah

242
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,520
Jimmy!

243
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,840
Hi, Mom!

244
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,120
Jimmy, you scared the bejeebers out of me!

245
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,400
Oh, sorry about your bejeebers, Mom.

246
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,200
- Might I add how lovely you look?. - I'm covered in transmission fluid.

247
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,440
Exactly! And might I say filth never looked so good?.

248
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,480
yes, well, how was show-and-tell today?.

249
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,960
It was okay. But first, happy birthday, Mom!

250
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,440
Jimmy, these are beautiful!

251
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,400
But, sweetie, it's not my birthday.

252
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,280
Oh, it's not?. Then whatever will I do...

253
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,920
with these lovely pearls and priceless earrings?.

254
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,240
These can't be real!

255
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,600
Oh, but they can, and they are!

256
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,240
And all these fabulous gifts and prizes could be yours...

257
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,640
if you know the correct answer to this question:

258
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,600
Please may I go to RetroLand tonight?.

259
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,160
- No, it's a school night. - Thank you and might I say--

260
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,840
- Did you just say no?. - yes.

261
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,360
- yes! - No.

262
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,720
- No?. - yes.

263
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,320
- yes! -Jimmy--

264
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,400
But-But-- all my friends are going...

265
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,560
and anybody who matters is going to be there, Mom!

266
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,120
I matter, and your father matters, and you matter.

267
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,200
But you're not going. Maybe we can go next weekend.

268
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,240
Wait. There must be something else in here to change your mind.

269
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,600
No, Jimmy, no! Look out! Look out, Jimmy! No!

270
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,960
Jimmy, be careful!

271
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,120
Mom, get me out! I'm starting to get a little--

272
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,280
I didn't do it!

273
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,840
Stop, drop and roll!

274
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,280
Goddard!

275
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,280
Okay, Jimmy. That's the last straw.

276
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,040
We have told you time and time again about playing with rockets.

277
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,720
But, Mom, it's technically not a rocket.

278
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,640
It's more of a jet-pack-type thing.

279
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,800
I don't care what type thing it is.

280
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,360
you just climb those stair-type things right now.

281
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,360
your father will have a few words to say to you when he gets home.

282
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,240
- It's not a rocket. - March!

283
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,020
yes!

284
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:37,260
The kingy loves his little orthgot. yes, he does.

285
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:40,060
yes, he does. yes, he does.

286
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,060
yes, he does.

287
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:48,860
Sire. My king. It appears to be some type of alien transmission device.

288
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:54,700
Tell me, when did it become acceptable...

289
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:58,060
to approach my royal throne unannounced?.

290
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,660
- Oh, yes, of course, my king-- - Space him!

291
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,700
Oh, wait!

292
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,500
Whoa!

293
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,780
Ooh! Oh, I missed it.

294
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,660
Can I-- Can I space another?.

295
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,620
- Oh, please, brother?. - I said no, Ooblar.

296
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,460
Oh, please, oh, please.

297
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,660
I would love for that to stop.

298
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,100
Oh, please!

299
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,180
What have we here?.

300
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,100
As the king's royal assistant...

301
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,940
I am the official checker of the new things to be checked.

302
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,700
It's all right! It's all right. I'll handle this.

303
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,620
Hello!

304
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:48,420
What galaxy are you from?.

305
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,900
- Ooblar. - Where is your leader?.

306
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:54,060
Ooblar, stop it. It's toast.

307
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,380
Hello, Toast!

308
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:02,620
I greatly admire your ship!

309
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,100
Beginning transmission from Earth.

310
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,180
Greetings from planet Earth.

311
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:14,220
I'm Jimmy Neutron. and youâ€™re an alien life-form.

312
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,100
- Oh, what a bi g head. - I welcome...

313
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:21,140
the exchange of scientific knowledge and universal brotherhood.

314
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,900
This here is my dog. Goddard.

315
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:30,340
And this that you're looking at is my room. That's where I sleep.

316
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,900
And this is my mom and dad right here-- mom. dad.

317
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,620
Freeze that image!

318
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:44,420
They look delicious!

319
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,780
The search is over!

320
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:00,060
Dad, all my friends will be there!

321
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,780
I know, son.

322
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,260
But if all your friends were named Cliff, would you jump off them?.

323
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,060
I don't think you would. you see, Jimmy--

324
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:10,420
Jimmy. Jim, Jim, Jimmy. Jim, James. Son...

325
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:14,060
let me tell you a little about rockets.

326
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,460
Oh, they're big-people things, son.

327
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,140
And you just can't go around playing with big-people...

328
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,740
fiery, flying things.

329
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:27,020
Because that's what rockets are. Rockets are flying things.

330
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:30,060
Well, I hope this talk has helped.

331
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:37,260
Oh, and by the way, Mom says you're grounded. Sorry!

332
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:40,140
Oh! What good is it to be a genius...

333
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,780
if you can't even go out on a school night?.

334
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,100
Goddard, options.

335
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,380
Apologize. Your parents love you.

336
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,700
Next.

337
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,460
Create a time capsule. Escape to the future.

338
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,860
Oh. Take too long. Next.

339
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,580
Build Goddard a female poodle.

340
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,900
Goddard, this is serious!

341
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,660
Sneak out.

342
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:08,340
That's it! Barbaric problems call for barbaric solutions.

343
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,700
Phone, please.

344
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,340
Carl?. It's me.

345
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,020
you get permission?. Me neither.

346
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,180
It turns out parents don't understand psychology.

347
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,820
Tell Sheen to meet us at RetroLand in one hour.

348
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,420
We're sneakin' out.

349
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,660
Hold it right there!

350
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,660
- Flurp! - Take that!

351
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:35,100
Jimmy's awfully quiet up there. Do you think we were too tough?.

352
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,900
Oh, I don't think so, dear, no.

353
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,180
- Maybe I should check on him. - Oh, now, now.

354
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:44,980
I'm sure he's just reflecting on the error of his ways...

355
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,580
dealing with it in a mature, responsible manner.

356
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,500
Mom says you're grounded. Take that!

357
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,740
It's working now.

358
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:58,980
Okay, Goddard. you know what to do.

359
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,300
Good boy!

360
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,780
See ya later, Goddard!

361
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:09,340
Mmm! Jimmy's a big boy now.

362
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:13,940
- Don't you worry. - Oh, I suppose you're right.

363
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:17,980
yeah, sure. Look, I was a kid once. I remember being grounded a week...

364
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:21,900
and not being allowed to go to my best friend's bachelor party.

365
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,060
- What did you do?. - Actually, I snuck out.

366
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,300
you don't think that Jimmy--

367
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,540
Oh, no, no. Besides, how's he gonna sneak out?.

368
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:36,380
It's not like he can just walk right out the front door.

369
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,820
That's true.

370
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,580
RetroLand, here I come.

371
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:59,220
Libby, you're breaking my concentration.

372
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:03,420
Hey, I gotta choose a ring that fits my personality.

373
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:06,100
yeah, here we go! Here we go!

374
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,020
Tell me what it is you're supposed to be doing again?.

375
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,980
Tai Chi while drinking Purple Flurp.

376
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:18,580
Tai Chi promotes wellness, relaxes...

377
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:21,660
and rejuvenates the body, whereas Purple Flurp...

378
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:26,060
being 98% sugar, creates tension...

379
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,380
a temporary rush of energy and mood swings.

380
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,940
I figure if I do them together...

381
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:35,940
I achieve perfect balance.

382
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:44,180
Wow. It's better than the poster!

383
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:48,300
Gentlemen, this will be a night we shan't easily forget.

384
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,180
I don't know what shan't means, but let's go!

385
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:24,100
Do you promise to use your powers for good and not evil?.

386
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,340
yes, UltraLord.

387
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:28,980
Now, counterpart, take this UltraMask...

388
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,660
- I will! Give it to me! - and lead the fight for justice!

389
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,020
Is this kid with anyone?.

390
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,100
Go, Carl!

391
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,860
Wow! Now, that's what I call a ride!

392
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,500
Let's go!

393
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:07,420
This is way beyond awesome!

394
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:11,180
Just think: If you boneheaded dweebs had listened to your parents...

395
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:15,100
you'd be home in bed, instead of riding this monster.

396
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,260
Oh, man, this is great!

397
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:28,540
- I tell you, he's fine. - Just a quick peek, Hugh.

398
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:31,020
There. Now, what'd I tell you?.

399
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:35,900
- Jimmy, are you awake, dear?. - yes, Mother, I am awake.

400
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:40,020
Son, your mother and I just wanted to say good night.

401
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,820
yes, and to tell you that we love you.

402
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:51,820
Oh, honey, I know you're upset.

403
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:56,620
We don't like to punish you. you're such a special boy.

404
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:32,500
This says we should encourage Jimmy without overindulging him.

405
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,180
Okay. What does it say about rockets?.

406
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:37,500
Is there someone in the kitchen?.

407
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,540
Our kitchen?. I didn't hear anything.

408
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,180
Honey, did you leave the green light on?.

409
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,740
Jimmy?.

410
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:59,060
you're not Jimmy!

411
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,740
Hugh, are you all right?.

412
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,380
Was that so cool?.

413
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,860
- That was great. - Mind-bending!

414
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:51,140
yeah! Hey, my pants are almost dry.

415
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:54,700
Hey, Jimmy, I never thought I'd say it, but here goes:

416
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:57,660
you know what?. That Nick is not such a bad guy.

417
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,660
Are you kidding?. He's a genius!

418
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:02,740
- He's a genius! - No offence, Jimmy.

419
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,180
None taken!

420
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,820
Actually, his insights on dealing with parents are quite refreshing.

421
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:11,380
Wouldn't it be great if our folks all disappeared for a while?.

422
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:15,220
Oh, yeah. Oh, hey, a shooting star!

423
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:18,300
Cool! you get to make a wish. Lucky.

424
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,140
What should I wish for?.

425
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:24,140
I know what I'd wish for. I'd wish for no more parents.

426
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:27,020
That way, we could do whatever we wanted, whenever we wanted.

427
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:31,140
We'd be free! We could have fun all the time!

428
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,940
yeah!

429
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:40,260
Lift off in five. four. three. two--

430
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,740
We have lift off!

431
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,380
Abort mission. Abort mission!

432
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:50,500
Goddard, wake mode.

433
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,860
All right, come on, boy. Race ya to the kitchen!

434
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,460
Beat ya!

435
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:02,220
Hey, Mom, did you get any more Purple Flurp?.

436
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,140
Mom?.

437
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,220
Dear son/daughter--

438
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,460
We've gone to Florida for an extended vacation.

439
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,580
Love. your parents. 

440
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:17,340
yeah. My parents went to Florida too.

441
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,260
That's weird.

442
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,180
From the look of it...

443
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:24,460
I'd say a lot of parents are gone.

444
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:29,260
- Did they all go to Florida?. - Maybe they went to get juice.

445
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:33,100
I don't digest pulp well. It makes me bloaty.

446
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,620
Goddard, scan for adult life-forms.

447
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:45,860
Just as I thought. There are no adults anywhere within radar.

448
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,820
They're gone. The whole city!

449
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,940
No parents.

450
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:56,100
No parents!

451
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,260
Excuse me!

452
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,900
I'm letting out the cold!

453
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,980
I'm peeing in the shower!

454
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,220
Llama, llama, llama!

455
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:22,780
I'm walking up the down escalator!

456
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:26,220
My clothes don't match. I'm out in public and my clothes don't match

457
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:40,300
I'm still doin' it! Go, go, go!

458
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:46,740
Welcome to the Candy Bar. Whoopee cushion or non-whoopee cushion?.

459
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,180
What'll it be, boys?.

460
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:01,220
We'll have what he's throwing.

461
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,740
Excellent choice!

462
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,260
Hang on!

463
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,660
No skiing in the halls!

464
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:17,340
Don't make me get the protractor!

465
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:50,620
Morning, Goddard. Oh, my head. What a night!

466
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:54,740
Oh, I'm stuffed now. I-I couldn't have anoth--

467
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,940
Okay, one more.

468
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,540
I'm gonna have one more, and then that'll be it.

469
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:06,260
What a battle. Are there any survivors?. Help me!

470
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,620
I remember my first time.

471
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,020
Shake it off, Neutron!

472
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,540
I gotta get home. Mom and Dad might be back by now.

473
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,260
Come on, Goddard.

474
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:31,180
We interrupt this program to bring you this special report.

475
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:33,020
Hey. knock it off. Arnie!

476
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,700
Trouble in paradise.

477
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:38,460
That's what some kids are saying in the aftermath of yesterdayâ€™s...

478
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,780
Mom and Dad are gone  celebrations.

479
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,700
Here's Courtney Tyler.

480
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:47,020
What started as an awesome day has become. like. a real bummer.

481
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:50,180
- Help us! - I don 't know how to make lunch!

482
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:52,100
Somebody hold me!

483
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:55,540
I was playing on the teeter-totter...

484
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:58,820
and the next thing I knew I was on the ground...

485
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:01,380
and my knee hurt!

486
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,580
Reports of tummy aches. owies and constipation...

487
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:09,620
have reached epidemic numbers over the past few hours...

488
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:12,020
with little indication of slowing down.

489
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:17,700
And so we were gonna see who could eat the most cotton candy...

490
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:20,380
and I won!

491
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:25,660
I want my mommy!

492
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,500
So. there you have it.

493
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:32,540
I want my mommy too!

494
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,940
Mom?. Dad?.

495
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:53,940
What kind of parents take off and leave their kid?.

496
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,540
And they didn't even say good-bye!

497
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:07,660
Son. your mother and I just wanted to say good night.

498
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,340
Yes. and to tell you that we love you.

499
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,680
We only do what we do because we love you.

500
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,720
Maybe we can all go to RetroLand next weekend. the three of us.

501
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,360
What about my fabulous dog. Goddard?

502
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,600
Sure. your fabulous dog. Goddard. too.

503
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,520
Well. good night. son.

504
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,480
Good night. Jimmy. Sweet dreams. We'll see you in the morning.

505
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:38,120
Okay, so they said good night.

506
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,360
 In the morning?. Hey, wait a minute!

507
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,600
Play back the last part again, audio only.

508
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,240
Good night. Jimmy. Sweet dreams. We'll see you in the morning.

509
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:50,880
There! Why would she say that if they weren't gonna be here?.

510
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,920
Come on, Goddard. We're goin' to the lab.

511
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,920
It's just as I thought.

512
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,840
The serifs and kerning on this note...

513
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,880
don't match Mom and Dad's handwriting.

514
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,560
This note's a fake!

515
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,480
What is it, boy?.

516
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,840
The long-range space scanner-- it detected something!

517
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:13,240
Filtering out background radiation, and there it is!

518
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:18,720
Jumpin'Jupiter! The Earth's been visited by aliens!

519
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,400
Okay, so me, you and a dog...

520
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:27,720
are gonna battle an alien civilization, right, by ourselves?.

521
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,440
But he's a good dog. Aren't you, boy?.

522
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,840
The last time we tried this, Jim...

523
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,080
we couldn't even break free of the atmosphere.

524
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,520
I know. But I recalculated the thrust-to-fuel ratio...

525
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:43,160
and I've adjusted the engine accordingly.

526
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,640
- I can fix that. - Neutron!

527
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,640
- What is it?. - An angry mob!

528
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,080
In times of crises, intellectuals are always the first to go!

529
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,880
Well, they don't look angry.

530
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,960
They look like they're about to barf.

531
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,400
Let me go!

532
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,480
you are messing with powers beyond your mortal comprehension.

533
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,120
Okay, Neutron.

534
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:14,520
UltraFreak here says you really know what happened to all our parents.

535
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,360
Jimmy, how ya doin'?.

536
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,920
I didn't say nothing about our parents being abducted by aliens--

537
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,840
Where's my mom and dad?.

538
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,840
Tell us where they are!

539
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,040
Goddard, star map 72, please.

540
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,120
Right about there.

541
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,480
Sensors picked up ion trails indicating the departure route...

542
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,160
for whatever alien intelligence has abducted our parents.

543
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:41,360
They lead to the Orion star system three million light-years away.

544
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,400
So we'll need to leave by Friday.

545
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,280
Okay, that gives us about two days to collect the plutonium...

546
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,800
design and test our fusion engines and build our fleet of warships.

547
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,840
We'll also need to bring snacks. Any questions?.

548
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,280
Are you sure about this, Neutron?.

549
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,440
Well, the data seems to support this hypothesis.

550
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,880
Never argue with the data.

551
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,120
Okay, Neutron, here's the lowdown.

552
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,760
you get us to those kidnapping alien scuzballs...

553
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,320
and I'll take it from there.

554
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,240
We're getting our parents back.

555
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,480
Okay, Ben, that's good. Let it down slow.

556
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,880
Two more turns, Emma, not too tight.

557
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,160
yup. Tape adhesion is within operational limits.

558
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,920
Aw, what-- Cindy!

559
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:51,280
What did you do to that intergalactic starship?.

560
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:55,200
We thought that the deep recesses of space could use a feminine touch.

561
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:59,240
- What do you think, Jimmy?. - yeah, it's okay, I guess.

562
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,360
They kinda ruined it though.

563
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,800
Hey, Jimmy! Do these fusion reactors need fuel rods?.

564
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:08,760
Sheen, it's not rocket science. you just have to--

565
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,720
Actually, I guess it is rocket science.

566
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:14,320
- No fuel rods, Sheen! - Okay.

567
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,160
And for the final touch--

568
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,280
Good work, everybody.

569
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:32,240
We're ready for intergalactic travel.

570
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:37,040
-Neutron, this is gonna work, right?. -yeah, what if it doesn't work?.

571
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,040
It will work!

572
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,080
I'm 95% sure it will.

573
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:44,880
Ninety-five?. yeah?. And the other five percent?.

574
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,920
We blow up.

575
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,320
But just a little.

576
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:52,080
Look, a 95 is still an A.

577
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:57,000
yeah, I can deal with that. I never got a 95 in my life.

578
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:02,240
you heard the man. Stop suckin' your thumbs, and let's light this candle!

579
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,800
Goddard, initiate launch sequence.

580
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,000
Please make sure your seat belts are fastened...

581
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:16,720
and remember to keep hands and arms inside the vehicles at all times.

582
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,400
yeah!

583
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,280
Come on, everybody. Get in formation.

584
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,400
Carl, you're too low.

585
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:07,360
Come on, you stupid butterfly! Will you-- Whoa!

586
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,840
Go, counterparts, go!

587
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:17,840
Hang on. We're passing through the stratosphere.

588
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,240
Now the mesosphere.

589
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,640
Entering ionosphere.

590
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,560
Now I know why they all end in fear!

591
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:31,240
That's it, baby. Engaging pulse rockets now!

592
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,800
Come on, come on.

593
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:06,440
Look, Goddard, the wonders of the universe.

594
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:11,640
We're witnessing celestial events no person, or dog, has ever seen.

595
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:16,320
It's incredible!

596
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,640
Beautiful, isn't it, Nick?.

597
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:29,480
yeah, yeah. Wake me when we get there.

598
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:31,540
Hey, Jimmy!

599
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:34,820
Do you think we can rotate ships after a while?.

600
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:37,020
Hey, we'll switch!

601
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:46,340
Hey, this astronaut food isn't too bad.

602
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:48,060
That's toothpaste, Carl.

603
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,300
Oh. Minty.

604
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,660
Hey, what's happening?.

605
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:57,460
Meteor shower! Evasive action!

606
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:10,860
I do so relish these times of peril.

607
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:32,460
- That was close. - Look out!

608
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,860
We gotta find shelter!

609
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:44,620
Asteroid bearing two-thirty-six mark seven degrees.

610
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,060
Come on!

611
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:13,780
So these three filmmakers find all these sticks in the trees...

612
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,820
shaped like stick people...

613
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,300
and the girl filmmaker starts cryin'...

614
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:23,380
and her nose starts dripping, and they don't have any tissue at all.

615
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:25,980
None?.

616
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:27,700
None.

617
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,900
So then they start to hear...

618
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:34,220
really scary noises and voices coming from outside.

619
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:37,180
So they leave the tent.

620
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,300
Don't leave the tent! Don't leave the tent!

621
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:43,620
Oh, yeah, Carl, they leave the tent, and they follow the voices...

622
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:46,860
when from out of the darkness comes the--

623
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:52,540
That was so choice! you should have seen your faces.

624
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:56,940
Did they really leave the tent, Nick?.

625
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:00,980
There's a red giant! And that's a white dwarf!

626
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:03,100
you can relate, huh, Neutron?.

627
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:08,260
Hey, Jimmy, what's the matter?.

628
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:12,980
In case you haven't noticed, I'm not exactly the tallest guy around.

629
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:17,380
Shorty, squirt, small stuff, shrimp-- gets to you after a while.

630
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:19,580
And next year, there'll be dances.

631
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:23,620
Who wants to dance with a guy who looks like he should still be in Gymboree?.

632
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,020
I didn't think we liked girls yet.

633
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:29,940
Oh, we don't. No, not yet.

634
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:32,740
No. However, one day, Carl...

635
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:35,580
an influx of hormones that we can't control...

636
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:37,700
will overpower our better judgment...

637
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:41,180
and drive us to pursue the female species against our will.

638
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:45,380
Stop talking like that, Jimmy! you're gonna give me nightmares.

639
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:50,460
Listen, I wouldn't worry. Puberty is light-years away for you and me.

640
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:58,820
you know, we should've never wished on that star and...

641
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:01,860
I, I miss my folks.

642
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:05,620
My mom used to tuck me in bed every night...

643
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:08,580
before she was abducted by aliens.

644
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:13,580
Before my dad was abducted by aliens...

645
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,980
he would always read me to sleep.

646
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:20,180
And before my mom was inducted by aliens...

647
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:24,420
she would rub my tummy, and she'd sing--

648
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:29,860
- What?. - Nothing!

649
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:33,900
Come on, you guys. We gotta keep our heads.

650
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:36,220
We'll find 'em.

651
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:10,940
What is it, boy?.

652
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:16,580
Sensor sweeps reveal many advanced cities and ion energy signatures.

653
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:18,020
That's it!

654
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:20,700
We found it! I repeat, we found it!

655
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:25,700
Nick, we'll contact you as soon as we find the parents...

656
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:27,820
so you can kick some alien buttocks!

657
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,260
Piece of cake.

658
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:32,620
Okay, scouting party, follow me!

659
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:35,100
I'll be back, Nick!

660
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,260
Whoa, what is that?.

661
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:11,820
They've evolved beyond the need for mere conventional bodies.

662
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:15,740
They must be an advanced species millions of years ahead of us.

663
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:20,940
Wow! When I sneeze, it looks like an advanced species too.

664
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:29,180
Okay, they're this way.

665
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:33,580
Right this way, sire.

666
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:38,580
Ooblar, these humans look so scrawny.

667
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:41,740
Hardly very appetizing. Are you sure they're yummy?.

668
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:46,460
I assure you, my slimy sovereign, Poultra will be quite pleased.

669
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:49,980
Humans are mostly water, with a crunchy bony center.

670
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:52,100
Think nuts and chews.

671
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:54,420
- There they are. - What are they doing?.

672
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,700
What are those goofy-looking things on their heads?.

673
00:51:56,820 --> 00:52:00,180
It looks like some kind of mind-control device.

674
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:04,660
Mom, Dad. Dad, it's me, Jimmy. Over here.

675
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:07,540
Jim, Jim, Jim, Jimmyâ€™s, James, James, Jim.

676
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:11,380
Big fiery flying Jimmy. Hi, Jimmy.

677
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:14,340
Some dream, huh?. Attack of the Big Egg People.

678
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,660
- I think I've seen this one before. - No, Dad.

679
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:20,220
you're wearing a mind-control device. Take yours off. Hurry!

680
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:24,820
- Dad?. - Intruder alert! Intruder alert!

681
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:26,820
- Dad, no, no! No! - Intruder alert!

682
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:31,340
your dad's like a mind-controlled duck man.

683
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:33,340
Let's get outta here!

684
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:36,500
Come back! Join us, Jimmy!

685
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:46,100
Well, well!

686
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:50,140
If it isn't the littlest rescue party. How cute.

687
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:52,220
Hello, itty-bitty humans.

688
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:55,020
you let us go, you big ball of phlegm!

689
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:58,580
That's no way to talk to the king! He is the royal phlegm.

690
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:00,780
- Ooblar. - Sorry, sire.

691
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:04,980
It's only fair to warn you that if you don't release us in 24 hours...

692
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:07,380
an army of highly-trained combat specialists...

693
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:10,260
is poised to destroy your entire planet.

694
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:12,100
- Oh, really?. - Really.

695
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:16,580
Oh, my! Our entire planet! Whatever shall we do?.

696
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:18,140
Do you mean...

697
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:21,380
this army of highly-trained combat specialists?.

698
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:23,420
Hey, Nick!

699
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:28,980
Get your grubs off me, egghead!

700
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:33,100
Don't look so surprised. We're an advanced alien race.

701
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:37,500
- What did you expect?. - What do you want with our parents?.

702
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:41,340
It's not what I want. It's what Poultra wants.

703
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:44,020
- Who's Poultra?. - Poultra is our god...

704
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,980
the mightiest, most ferocious creature in all--

705
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:50,340
Oh, I get tired of answering this. Roll tape.

706
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:57,660
Hello and welcome to our special edition of Poultra: God of Wrath.

707
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:00,220
Brought to you by Goom--

708
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:02,420
Commercials! I hate them.

709
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:03,980
Welcome back.

710
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:07,820
If youâ€™re watching this. chances are your friends and or relatives...

711
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:11,180
are about to be sacrificed to the mighty Poultra.

712
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:12,980
Which is a great honor indeed.

713
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:14,700
And very painful.

714
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:21,340
And this yearâ€™s human sacrifices feature something very special--

715
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:23,260
actual humans!

716
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:26,420
And it's all thanks to Jimmy Neutron.

717
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:28,900
Greetings from planet Earth!

718
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,540
I'm Jimmy Neutron. and youâ€™re an alien life-form.

719
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:33,500
I'm Jimmy Neutron. and youâ€™re an alien life-form.

720
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,620
Without the coordinates you gave us...

721
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:38,420
we never would have found your puny little planet.

722
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:43,020
For such a tiny earthling, you've been a very big help, Jimmy Neutron.

723
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:46,180
Guards, throw these minuscule vermin into the dungeon...

724
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:48,100
until they're of worthier size.

725
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:51,620
And oh, give Mr. Neutron the presidential suite.

726
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:53,460
What?.

727
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:02,460
Ohh! Isn't this a funny-wunny little toy!

728
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:06,900
Get it off me!

729
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:10,340
Take this infernal thing to the lab and have it torn apart!

730
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:13,900
Oh, yes, great saliva-armed one.

731
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:15,900
Hold it! Move along.

732
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:18,020
- Goddard! - Move!

733
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,520
So, it was Neutron all along.

734
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,440
I mean, he got us into this.

735
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:46,480
Jimmy, didn't your parents ever tell you not to talk to strangers?.

736
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,360
That's rule number one.

737
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:51,160
Oh, come on, you guys! Give him a break.

738
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:53,360
Jimmy didn't mean to ruin our lives...

739
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:56,720
and get our parents eaten by a giant space monster!

740
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:01,600
She's right. We must ask ourselves, What would UltraLord do??'

741
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,520
Let's think about that, Sheen.

742
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:06,400
Maybe sit on a shelf, because he's a doll!

743
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,000
He's not a doll! He's an action figure! There's a difference.

744
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:13,120
Come on, Nick, let Sheen talk. Maybe he's onto something.

745
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,240
What would UltraLord do, Sheen?.

746
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:17,240
Well, in episode 224...

747
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:20,400
he fried the Zeebot's brain with his heat-seeking infra-thought.

748
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,120
It was cool!

749
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,160
Well, I'm convinced, folks.

750
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:29,040
That's pretty much the stupidest thing I've ever heard!

751
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:31,640
No, this is the stupidest thing you've ever heard!

752
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:36,600
- Oh, you're such a baby! - Why don't you leave me alone?.

753
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,000
you're picking on me because you're insecure!

754
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:42,480
Jimmy, you there?.

755
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:47,080
Look, don't listen to them. They're just scared.

756
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,000
Are you okay?.

757
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,760
yeah, I'm fine.

758
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:55,520
Don't be so hard on yourself. We'll get out of this.

759
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:00,200
Okay, so you made a mistake.

760
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:03,000
Beating yourself up isn't gonna fix anything.

761
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:08,160
you know, I was the smartest kid in school until you came along.

762
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:11,320
And I admit you know more about some things than I do.

763
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:14,680
But I know one thing that you don't seem to get...

764
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:18,520
and that's that we're never getting outta here without you.

765
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:21,400
So why don't you buck up, mister...

766
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:24,000
and put that big brain of yours back to work?.

767
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,200
Nick can handle the fighting stuff...

768
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,520
but first we have to get out of this cell.

769
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,240
Cindy?.

770
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,840
Why are you being so nice to me?.

771
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:38,880
'Cause there's a bunch of kids in here that need you...

772
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,760
and I do too.

773
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:50,960
I am never complaining about my parents again.

774
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,160
We didn't even get our one phone call.

775
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,560
That's it!

776
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,480
Libby, let me see your cell phone.

777
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,880
Okay, but I don't think my service plan...

778
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:04,000
covers anything outside our solar system.

779
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:07,840
- Who're you calling?. - A friend of mine.

780
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,000
All right, little Earth doggy.

781
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,880
Ooblar is going to take you apart into tiny little pieces.

782
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,320
All right?.

783
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:27,400
Hey! Give me that!

784
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:29,880
Fine! We'll use this one then.

785
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:32,000
No-no-no-no!

786
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:36,000
Would you stop that! Those are mine!

787
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:48,600
That's not funny. Stop it! And give me my thing!

788
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,400
Come on, boy, pick up.

789
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:55,600
Oh, good! Good. Perhaps we'll get somewhere.

790
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:57,880
Goddard, you're okay.

791
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:02,960
I miss you too, boy. Listen, what's your situation?.

792
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,800
Evil scientist, huh?.

793
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:11,800
Okay, I've got an idea. Put me on speaker, Goddard.

794
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,960
Danger! Danger!

795
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:18,600
You have initiated self-destruct sequence alpha.

796
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:21,760
That's my bad. Back in you go.

797
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,840
Self-destruct sequence is now engaged.

798
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:27,440
No-no-no! I put it back in. you understand me?.

799
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:31,560
This unit will yield a 50-megaton nuclear blast in ten seconds.

800
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,360
That's not good!

801
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:37,960
Please clear a 30-square mile area. Thank you. And have a nice day.

802
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:39,600
Ten. nine--

803
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:42,960
No! Bad dog! Mother!

804
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:45,560
Is he gone, boy?.

805
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:49,080
Great! Lock on to this signal and get here as fast as you can.

806
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,960
Halt! Who goes there?.

807
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:00,400
Oh, the guard!

808
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:02,640
By order of the most esteemed King Goobot...

809
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:06,640
it is my privilege and honor to mercilessly exterminate you.

810
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:09,320
Think, think. Goddard, play dead.

811
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:22,480
Good boy, Goddard, good boy!

812
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:24,760
Guess I'll make that bug a feature.

813
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:27,080
- Good dog, Goddard! - Way to go!

814
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:30,040
- Come on! Let's get the others! - Nice work, Jimmy.

815
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:36,560
Hey, Cindy, thanks.

816
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:39,840
If you ever tell anyone I was nice to you...

817
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,760
you'll wind up looking like that guy.

818
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,920
Let's go, Neutron! It's egg-scrambling time.

819
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:49,720
- Wait for me, Nick! - Come back!

820
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:52,760
Please?.

821
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,120
Bring out the humans!

822
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:21,160
It's show time.

823
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:22,720
Everybody out.

824
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:38,640
Kick it!

825
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:03,000
- Look, you guys, a football game! - I don't think so, Carl.

826
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:05,680
Goddard, binoscope mode!

827
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,000
What a lame halftime show.

828
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:20,520
They're making our parents dance so lame.

829
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:23,520
No, my dad really dances like that.

830
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:28,600
The festival is starting.

831
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,880
Our parents-- they'll be eaten!

832
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:35,200
Nobody eats my parents unless I say so! Come on!

833
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:39,920
Begin the incubation!

834
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:48,240
C'mon, Nick. Show them what you're made of!

835
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:50,160
Halt!

836
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:52,000
Hey, cool spear.

837
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,680
Oh, you really think so?. I guess so, because--

838
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:57,840
Mind if I try?.

839
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,800
No-no-no!

840
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:02,840
My hero!

841
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:05,880
Come on, everyone!

842
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:27,840
My hero?.

843
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:30,160
Okay, we need another plan.

844
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,440
Probably a Nick-less one.

845
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:43,400
Poultra! Poultra!

846
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,120
Citizens of yokus...

847
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:49,720
I, King Goobot V...

848
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:52,800
give you sacrifice!

849
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:02,880
That's a big chicken.

850
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,680
What do we do now?.

851
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:28,480
Think! Think!

852
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,400
Brain Blast!

853
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:40,360
Okay, everybody, listen up. We don't have much time.

854
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:42,680
I've got to make it to that control tower.

855
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:46,480
Cindy, Libby, keep the guards busy until Sheen arrives with the ship.

856
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:49,339
Okay, I heard the ship part, but was that, Sheen, get the ship?.

857
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:51,260
- yeah. - Ohh! Oh.

858
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:54,740
There's a transport ship big enough to carry us out of here.

859
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:56,540
I need you to get it here as fast as you can.

860
01:04:56,660 --> 01:05:00,380
But I don't have a driver's license. I have no hand-eye coordination.

861
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:03,180
Ask yourself, what would UltraLord do?.

862
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:07,380
I accept this responsibility...

863
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:10,820
understanding the consequences you've bestowed against me.

864
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:15,820
Poultra, din-dins. yummy, yummy, foodie-woodie.

865
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:21,780
This is it, people. These crummy aliens stole our parents.

866
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:23,700
It's time to show them what we're made of.

867
01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:27,700
We're tough, we're mean! Darn it, we're carbon-based life-forms!

868
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:29,820
Now, who's gonna kick buttocks?.

869
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:31,820
The carbonated  life-forms!

870
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:41,620
What?. What?. What is this?. Stop those kids!

871
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:42,980
After 'em!

872
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:48,540
Cindy, Purple Flurp!

873
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:52,060
Dragon whips her tail.

874
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:04,060
Let's dance!

875
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:12,700
yeah, Jimmy!

876
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:15,860
Come on, boy!

877
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:17,580
Jimmy!

878
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:19,300
Carl, show-and-tell!

879
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:22,180
Come here, you!

880
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:24,580
I can't see!

881
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:30,620
you want some?. you want a piece of me?.

882
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:33,900
I didn't think so!

883
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:45,100
Munchy, crunchy time. There you go!

884
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:50,860
- Fetch, boy! - Hey, hey, gimme' that!

885
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:52,700
- Come back here! - Everybody up.

886
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:04,580
Hey, nice party! Gotta blast!

887
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:06,700
Neutron!

888
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:08,620
Okay, let's move out.

889
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:15,140
Guards, vaporize the Earth brats!

890
01:07:19,620 --> 01:07:22,420
Hurry! Head to the exit!

891
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:26,620
- Hey, where's Sheen?. - I don't know.

892
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:28,380
Stop them!

893
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:43,220
All right, Sheen!

894
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:48,900
your ship awaits, Captain Jimmy!

895
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:02,780
Ooblar, protect--

896
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:09,220
Oh, pooh!

897
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:11,220
Everybody to the ship!

898
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:16,300
Poultra, quickly! your dinner's getting away!

899
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:18,220
Okay, let's get outta here.

900
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:20,260
Come on!

901
01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:29,180
We gotta do this quick! Launch positions.

902
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:31,660
Core temperature optimal. Engaging primary plasma coils.

903
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:34,420
- Jim, I think we better leave now. - Beginning countdown. Ten. Nine.

904
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:36,660
Eight--

905
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:38,180
One!

906
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:50,540
To the ships!

907
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:52,940
And could someone bring me a bucket?.

908
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:56,420
We made it!

909
01:08:56,420 --> 01:08:59,740
Jimmy, here they come!

910
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:07,700
Time to discipline the naughty children. Open fire!

911
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:21,620
Okay, who wants fried chicken?.

912
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:47,420
So, Neutron, now it's just you and I.

913
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:49,260
All weapons on-line!

914
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:54,220
UltraLord is not afraid of chickens He is not afraid

915
01:09:57,580 --> 01:10:00,860
Okay. he may be a little bit afraid of chickens

916
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:03,140
This thing's too slow. I can't outrun 'em!

917
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:05,460
- Incoming message. - On screen.

918
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:08,700
You see. Jimmy. you can't win.

919
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:11,580
All of your friends and family would be safe at home...

920
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:14,860
if it wasn't for one little problem-- you.

921
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:17,740
- Little?. - Now you all must die!

922
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:23,020
Little, huh?. I'll show you little.

923
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:24,940
Cindy, take over. C'mon, boy.

924
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:29,340
What are you doing?. Is this one of those macho things?.

925
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:34,020
We haven't field tested this feature yet, but we have no choice, buddy.

926
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:36,620
Goddard, FlyCycle!

927
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:49,780
Would you look at this?. I do believe he's going to ram us, Ooblar.

928
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:53,420
Remind me to clean the windshield later.

929
01:10:56,580 --> 01:10:59,540
you steal my parents, you threaten my dog.

930
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:01,380
Itsy-bitsy Jimmy Neutron!

931
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:04,260
He does look a bit small and silly, doesn't he?.

932
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:07,500
you attack my friends, and you made fun of my size!

933
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:09,900
- Tiny, tiny. - So, so tiny!

934
01:11:09,980 --> 01:11:14,700
Well, I may be small, but I've got a big brain!

935
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:22,100
- No! - Not tiny!

936
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:28,020
Can't we call this whole thing a mistake and go back to your plan...

937
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:31,180
rendezvous for universal brotherhood and what not?.

938
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:42,980
you've not seen the last of us...

939
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:45,500
Jimmy Neutron!

940
01:11:47,980 --> 01:11:50,260
you look marvellous sunny-side up, sire.

941
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:52,100
That's no yolk.

942
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:56,420
All right, Jimmy!

943
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:59,180
Orbiting around Jimmy's big head.

944
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:01,500
Estimated time to ear, seven minutes.

945
01:12:06,980 --> 01:12:11,180
So I guess I can't call you short anymore.

946
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:15,580
Don't worry. I'm sure there are other insults you can come up with.

947
01:12:21,940 --> 01:12:24,980
Let me tell you, as soon as we get home...

948
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:27,380
we're going out dancing!

949
01:12:30,940 --> 01:12:32,580
UltraDad!

950
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:35,060
UltraSon!

951
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:37,940
Dad?. Daddy!

952
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:40,140
Hey, Neutron...

953
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:41,700
nice job.

954
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:44,060
Thanks.

955
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:47,900
I've got that for you, dear.

956
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:54,060
Mom, Dad...

957
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:57,900
I should've listened to you when you said don't talk to strangers.

958
01:12:57,980 --> 01:13:02,300
See, I guess I thought I was smart enough to do everything on my own...

959
01:13:02,380 --> 01:13:04,220
that I didn't need you.

960
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:06,700
But I was wrong.

961
01:13:06,820 --> 01:13:08,820
I love you guys.

962
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:11,220
We love you too, Jimmy.

963
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:14,380
Having a genius for a son may not always be easy...

964
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:16,700
but it's always interesting.

965
01:13:16,780 --> 01:13:18,980
you make us so proud.

966
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:20,540
you sure do.

967
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:23,780
Not every family gets to ride in an alien spaceship...

968
01:13:23,780 --> 01:13:27,420
hurtling at warp speeds, millions of miles from home.

969
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:29,460
We thank you for that.

970
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:32,300
Now you gotta admit, that is pretty neat.

971
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:39,980
There you are, gentlemen.
There you are, gentlemen.

972
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:41,420
Freeze!

973
01:13:41,620 --> 01:13:45,180
- It's okay, it's just breakfast. - I knew that.

974
01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:48,540
I don't remember buying this brand of soda.

975
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:49,860
No, Mom--

976
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:52,380
Jimmy, it's just soda.

977
01:13:52,460 --> 01:13:54,260
Mom, no!

978
01:13:56,020 --> 01:13:59,460
Goodness! Excuse me!

979
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:02,140
Boy, it's a scorcher out there!

980
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:03,660
Thanks, honey.

981
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:08,460
At least it's coming out of the attic, not the basement!

982
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:23,060
James Isaac Neutron--

983
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:28,260
Onward, Mr. Wiggles. We reach the cafeteria by dawn!
