All these years...

379
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:44,340
I was convinced
I had the incorrect sequence.

380
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,340
Or perhaps the wrong symbols

381
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,010
to open the door.

382
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:54,180
But on that woman's

383
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,690
the seven symbols.

384
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:02,660

repeated itself seven times.

385
