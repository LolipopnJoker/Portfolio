1
00:01:35,598 --> 00:01:36,933
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

2
00:01:37,016 --> 00:01:38,684
<i>Woke up today</i>

3
00:01:38,768 --> 00:01:42,271
<i>Feeling the way I always do</i>

4
00:01:42,772 --> 00:01:44,065
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

5
00:01:44,148 --> 00:01:47,485
<i>Hungry for something that I can't eat</i>

6
00:01:47,568 --> 00:01:49,237
<i>Then I hear that beat</i>

7
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,199
<i>That rhythm of town
Starts calling me down</i>

8
00:01:53,283 --> 00:01:57,120
<i>It's like a message from high above</i>

9
00:01:57,203 --> 00:01:58,580
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

10
00:01:58,663 --> 00:02:02,625
<i>Pulling me out to the smiles
And the streets that I love</i>

11
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:06,046
<i>- Good morning, Baltimore!
- Good morning, Baltimore</i>

12
00:02:06,129 --> 00:02:09,674
<i>Every day's like an open door</i>

13
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,178
<i>Every night is a fantasy</i>

14
00:02:13,261 --> 00:02:16,973
<i>Every sound's like a symphony</i>

15
00:02:17,057 --> 00:02:20,727
<i>Good morning, Baltimore</i>

16
00:02:20,811 --> 00:02:23,939
<i>And someday when I take to the floor</i>

17
00:02:24,022 --> 00:02:27,818
<i>The world's gonna wake up and see</i>

18
00:02:27,901 --> 00:02:30,696
<i>Baltimore and me</i>

19
00:02:40,622 --> 00:02:41,957
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

20
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,584
<i>Look at my hair</i>

21
00:02:43,667 --> 00:02:47,713
<i>What 'do can compare with mine today?</i>

22
00:02:47,796 --> 00:02:49,214
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

23
00:02:49,298 --> 00:02:52,593
<i>I've got my hairspray and radio</i>

24
00:02:52,676 --> 00:02:54,428
<i>I'm ready to go</i>

25
00:02:54,511 --> 00:02:56,263
<i>The rats on the street</i>

26
00:02:56,347 --> 00:02:58,057
<i>All dance around my feet</i>

27
00:02:58,182 --> 00:03:02,144
<i>They seem to say,
"Tracy, it's up to you"</i>

28
00:03:02,228 --> 00:03:04,939
<i>So, oh, oh, don't hold me back</i>

29
00:03:05,064 --> 00:03:07,650
<i>'Cause today all my dreams
Will come true</i>

30
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:11,112
<i>Good morning, Baltimore</i>

31
00:03:11,195 --> 00:03:14,740
<i>There's the flasher
Who lives next door</i>

32
00:03:14,824 --> 00:03:18,327
<i>There's the bum on his barroom stool</i>

33
00:03:18,411 --> 00:03:22,248
<i>They wish me luck on my way to school</i>

34
00:03:22,331 --> 00:03:25,626
<i>Good morning, Baltimore</i>

35
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,754
<i>And someday when I take to the floor</i>

36
00:03:28,838 --> 00:03:32,884
<i>The world's gonna wake up and see</i>

37
00:03:32,967 --> 00:03:35,303
<i>Baltimore and me</i>

38
00:03:37,722 --> 00:03:39,599
<i>I know every step</i>

39
00:03:39,682 --> 00:03:41,309
<i>I know every song</i>

40
00:03:41,392 --> 00:03:44,979
<i>I know there's a place where I belong</i>

41
00:03:45,063 --> 00:03:48,483
<i>I see all those party lights
Shining ahead</i>

42
00:03:48,566 --> 00:03:52,403
<i>So someone invite me
before I drop dead</i>

43
00:03:52,487 --> 00:03:54,572
<i>Before she drops dead</i>

44
00:03:54,656 --> 00:03:57,575
<i>So, oh, oh, give me a chance</i>

45
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:01,830
<i>'Cause when I start to dance
I'm a movie star</i>

46
00:04:01,913 --> 00:04:03,206
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

47
00:04:03,289 --> 00:04:06,626
<i>Something inside of me makes me move</i>

48
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,461
<i>When I hear that groove</i>

49
00:04:08,545 --> 00:04:10,171
<i>My ma tells me "no"</i>

50
00:04:10,255 --> 00:04:12,257
<i>But my feet tell me "go"</i>

51
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,386
<i>It's like a drummer inside my heart</i>

52
00:04:21,767 --> 00:04:24,352
<i>So, oh, oh, don't make me wait</i>

53
00:04:24,436 --> 00:04:32,653
<i>One more moment for my life to start</i>

54
00:04:32,736 --> 00:04:36,031
<i>I love you, Baltimore</i>

55
00:04:36,114 --> 00:04:39,660
<i>Every day's like an open door</i>

56
00:04:39,743 --> 00:04:43,247
<i>Every night is a fantasy</i>

57
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,834
<i>Every sound's like a symphony</i>

58
00:04:46,917 --> 00:04:50,504
<i>And I promise, Baltimore</i>

59
00:04:50,587 --> 00:04:53,590
<i>That someday when I take to the floor</i>

60
00:04:53,674 --> 00:04:57,761
<i>The world's gonna wake up and see</i>

61
00:04:57,845 --> 00:05:01,432
<i>Gonna wake up and see</i>

62
00:05:01,515 --> 00:05:05,019
<i>- Baltimore and me
- Yes, more or less, we all agree</i>

63
00:05:05,102 --> 00:05:08,773
<i>- Baltimore and me
- Someday the world is gonna see</i>

64
00:05:08,856 --> 00:05:17,198
<i>Baltimore and me</i>

65
00:05:22,411 --> 00:05:24,664
Mount Everest is the most famous

66
00:05:24,747 --> 00:05:28,334
but not the highest
geographical point on this Earth.

67
00:05:28,417 --> 00:05:30,795
Now, who can tell me what that is?

68
00:05:30,878 --> 00:05:32,630
Um, excuse me, Miss Whimsy?

69
00:05:33,131 --> 00:05:34,465
I can't see the board again.

70
00:05:35,925 --> 00:05:37,218
Tracy Turnblad.

71
00:05:37,844 --> 00:05:39,137
If I have to write you up

72
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:42,348
for inappropriate hair height
one more time,

73
00:05:42,432 --> 00:05:44,434
you will be removed to detention.

74
00:05:44,517 --> 00:05:46,769
Miss Wimsey,
what am I supposed to do?

75
00:05:46,853 --> 00:05:49,856
Hair can't just hang there
like a dead thing on your cheeks.

76
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:51,900
I mean, Well,

77
00:05:52,692 --> 00:05:54,319
You know what I mean. I,

78
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:00,533
As I said, it is not Mount Everest.

79
00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:06,539
Now, next week, we will be talking
about earthquakes and volcanoes.

80
00:06:06,623 --> 00:06:09,251
And as exciting as that might sound,

81
00:06:09,334 --> 00:06:13,129
we have to look back
approximately 60 million years.

82
00:06:13,213 --> 00:06:14,714
Now, if you turn your pages,

83
00:06:14,798 --> 00:06:16,758
we are going to start
with the Ring of Fire.

84
00:06:16,842 --> 00:06:21,179
I want you to contemplate what causes
the separation of the two components.

85
00:06:34,776 --> 00:06:36,695
Penny, come on, hurry!

86
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,490
Outta my way!

87
00:06:40,616 --> 00:06:41,825
Push! We're late.

88
00:06:54,421 --> 00:06:56,340
- One minute to air.
- Okay.

89
00:07:04,682 --> 00:07:06,183
<i>Don't change that channel.</i>

90
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:08,602
<i>Coming up next,</i>
The Corny Collins Show.

91
00:07:08,936 --> 00:07:09,979
Thirty seconds.

92
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:20,156
- Hiya, Dad!
- Goodbye!

93
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:21,532
Hi.

94
00:07:21,616 --> 00:07:22,658
It's my daughter.

95
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:25,036
10 seconds. Places, everyone.

96
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:28,247
Hurry up, Penny, we're missing it!

97
00:07:28,331 --> 00:07:30,291
My mom says I'm not allowed
to perspire!

98
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:36,172
<i>Hey there, teenage Baltimore!</i>

99
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:37,632
<i>Don't change that channel</i>

100
00:07:37,715 --> 00:07:40,218
<i>'cause it's time</i>
<i>for</i> The Corny Collins Show!

101
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,304
<i>Brought to you
by Ultra Clutch hairspray.</i>

102
00:07:44,013 --> 00:07:47,600
<i>Oh, every afternoon
When the clock strikes four</i>

103
00:07:47,684 --> 00:07:49,602
<i>Bop-bee-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba, bee-ba</i>

104
00:07:49,686 --> 00:07:53,231
<i>Well, a crazy bunch of kids
Crash through that door, yeah</i>

105
00:07:53,314 --> 00:07:55,442
<i>Bop-bee-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba, bee-ba</i>

106
00:07:55,525 --> 00:07:58,111
<i>Well, they throw off their coats
And leave the squares behind</i>

107
00:07:58,194 --> 00:07:59,738
<i>And then they shake it,
Shake it, shake it</i>

108
00:07:59,821 --> 00:08:01,031
<i>Like they're losing their mind</i>

109
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:02,365
<i>You'll never see them frown</i>

110
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:04,701
<i>'Cause they're the nicest kids
In town</i>

111
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:07,454
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

112
00:08:07,537 --> 00:08:09,414
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

113
00:08:09,497 --> 00:08:12,709
<i>Oh, every afternoon
You turn your TV on, huh</i>

114
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:15,128
<i>Na, na, na</i>

115
00:08:15,212 --> 00:08:18,548
<i>Yeah, we know you turn the sound up
When your parents are gone, yeah</i>

116
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:20,884
<i>Na, na, na</i>

117
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,637
<i>Then you twist and shout
For your favourite star</i>

118
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,431
<i>And when you've practiced every step
That's in your repertoire</i>

119
00:08:26,515 --> 00:08:31,311
<i>You better come on down
And meet the nicest kids in town</i>

120
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:35,274
<i>Nice white kids
Who like to lead the way</i>

121
00:08:35,357 --> 00:08:38,110
<i>And once a month
We have our Negro Day</i>

122
00:08:38,193 --> 00:08:40,737
<i>And I'm the man
Who keeps it spinning round</i>

123
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:43,866
<i>Mr Corny Collins
With the latest, greatest</i>

124
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:47,745
<i>Baltimore sound</i>

125
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:50,622
<i>So, every afternoon, drop everything</i>

126
00:08:51,248 --> 00:08:53,250
<i>Bop-bee-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba, bee-ba</i>

127
00:08:53,334 --> 00:08:56,879
<i>Who needs to read and write
When you can dance and sing, yeah!</i>

128
00:08:56,962 --> 00:08:59,256
<i>Bop-bee-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba, bee-ba</i>

129
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,926
<i>Forget about your algebra
And calculus</i>

130
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:04,512
<i>You can always do your homework
On the morning bus</i>

131
00:09:04,595 --> 00:09:06,138
<i>Can't tell a verb from a noun</i>

132
00:09:06,222 --> 00:09:08,391
<i>They're the nicest kids in town</i>

133
00:09:08,474 --> 00:09:09,975
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

134
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:11,977
<i>Roll call!</i>

135
00:09:13,312 --> 00:09:14,355
I'm Amber.

136
00:09:14,939 --> 00:09:15,982
Brad.

137
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,775
- Tammy.
- Fender.

138
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:18,901
- Brenda.
- Sketch.

139
00:09:18,985 --> 00:09:20,027
- Shelley.
- IQ.

140
00:09:20,111 --> 00:09:21,153
Lou Ann.

141
00:09:21,237 --> 00:09:22,613
<i>- Joey. Mikey.
- Vicki. Becky.</i>

142
00:09:22,697 --> 00:09:23,739
<i>- Bix.
- Jesse.</i>

143
00:09:23,823 --> 00:09:24,866
<i>- Darla.
- Paulie.</i>

144
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:26,159
<i>- Noreen.
- Doreen.</i>

145
00:09:27,201 --> 00:09:29,245
<i>And I'm... Link.</i>

146
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:33,124
<i>So, if every night you're shaking
As you lie in bed</i>

147
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,752
<i>- Mony, mony</i>
- Shake it, baby

148
00:09:35,835 --> 00:09:39,339
<i>And the bass and drums
Are pounding in your head</i>

149
00:09:39,422 --> 00:09:41,633
<i>Mony, mony, ooh, mony, mony</i>

150
00:09:41,716 --> 00:09:44,427
<i>Who cares about sleep
When you can snooze in school</i>

151
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,971
<i>You'll never get to college
But you'll sure look cool</i>

152
00:09:47,055 --> 00:09:48,556
<i>Don't need a cap or a gown</i>

153
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,017
<i>When you're the nicest kids in town</i>

154
00:09:51,976 --> 00:09:54,270
They must think my ears
are garbage cans.

155
00:09:54,813 --> 00:09:57,148
Would you turn that racket down?

156
00:09:58,149 --> 00:09:59,609
I'm trying to iron here.

157
00:10:00,193 --> 00:10:01,778
<i>Nicest kids in...</i>

158
00:10:05,031 --> 00:10:06,074
<i>Kids in town</i>

159
00:10:06,157 --> 00:10:07,200
<i>- Whoo!
- Whoo!</i>

160
00:10:08,618 --> 00:10:11,037
Ma, it's not racket.
It's <i>The Corny Collins Show.</i>

161
00:10:11,121 --> 00:10:13,415
Well, it's turning your brains
into mud.

162
00:10:13,498 --> 00:10:15,459
Mrs Turnblad, it's a new dance!

163
00:10:15,542 --> 00:10:17,169
The Stricken Chicken.

164
00:10:17,252 --> 00:10:18,962
Well, I can't hear myself think.

165
00:10:19,463 --> 00:10:21,840
How am I supposed
to negotiate pleats?

166
00:10:22,549 --> 00:10:24,176
- Edna?
- I'm in here, Prudy.

167
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:25,594
What's that racket?

168
00:10:27,971 --> 00:10:29,306
Oh, Tracy.

169
00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:30,682
Edna, is my laundry ready?

170
00:10:30,766 --> 00:10:31,808
Yep.

171
00:10:32,684 --> 00:10:34,186
That'll be three dollars, hon.

172
00:10:34,686 --> 00:10:36,647
That's pretty pricey
for a pair of petty pants.

173
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,065
Well, I'm sorry, Prudy,

174
00:10:38,148 --> 00:10:41,360
but some of your personal stains
required pounding with a rock.

175
00:10:42,694 --> 00:10:44,196
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.

176
00:10:45,656 --> 00:10:48,826
You're letting her listen
to that race music again?

177
00:10:48,909 --> 00:10:51,704
My daughter spends every afternoon
at the Stamp and Coin Club.

178
00:10:51,787 --> 00:10:53,789
Oh, really?
Well, your daughter hap...

179
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,877
Oh, what is that? The Waving Raven?

180
00:10:58,919 --> 00:10:59,962
It's a little twitchy.

181
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,341
Oh, you wanna play Charades now.
All right.

182
00:11:05,217 --> 00:11:06,260
Okay, go ahead.

183
00:11:06,719 --> 00:11:07,928
You.

184
00:11:08,012 --> 00:11:09,138
Penny.

185
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,723
No.

186
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,643
Tracy Turnblad.

187
00:11:13,726 --> 00:11:14,769
Are you trying to tell me

188
00:11:14,852 --> 00:11:17,480
that Penny didn't get permission
from her mother to be here?

189
00:11:17,563 --> 00:11:18,606
What?

190
00:11:19,106 --> 00:11:20,149
Penny.

191
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:22,735
You are banned from this house!

192
00:11:22,818 --> 00:11:24,862
You will never watch that show again!

193
00:11:24,946 --> 00:11:26,197
Without that show, I have nothing!

194
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,074
Having nothing builds character!

195
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,952
Toodle-oo, Edna!

196
00:11:38,626 --> 00:11:39,919
Give them a hand, folks.

197
00:11:40,003 --> 00:11:41,588
All right, all right.

198
00:11:44,757 --> 00:11:46,968
And, once again,
that's the Stricken Chicken.

199
00:11:47,051 --> 00:11:48,094
We will be right back

200
00:11:48,178 --> 00:11:50,054
for some more
of that hot Detroit sound.

201
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:52,974
And we're off!

202
00:11:53,767 --> 00:11:54,976
Corny.

203
00:11:56,644 --> 00:11:58,104
"Detroit sound"?

204
00:11:58,188 --> 00:12:00,273
What's that,
the cries of people being mugged?

205
00:12:00,357 --> 00:12:02,192
Aw, Velma.
The kids dig the rhythm and blues.

206
00:12:02,275 --> 00:12:03,568
Yeah, they're kids, Corny.

207
00:12:03,652 --> 00:12:06,529
That's why we have to steer them
in the white direction.

208
00:12:06,613 --> 00:12:07,656
Right direction?

209
00:12:08,782 --> 00:12:10,033
Didn't I say that?

210
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:18,917
I'll do it.

211
00:12:23,213 --> 00:12:24,381
You try that again

212
00:12:24,464 --> 00:12:26,091
and there'll be stumps
where your feet should be.

213
00:12:26,174 --> 00:12:27,718
You got that? You little who...

214
00:12:27,801 --> 00:12:30,178
- Amber.
- Holy moly.

215
00:12:30,262 --> 00:12:31,346
Baby.

216
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,973
Good job dancing today.

217
00:12:33,056 --> 00:12:34,099
It's time.

218
00:12:35,184 --> 00:12:36,768
- Link.
- Amber.

219
00:12:37,686 --> 00:12:39,980
Amber. Amber, Amber, Amber.

220
00:12:41,523 --> 00:12:43,400
Save your personal life
for the cameras, sweetie.

221
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:45,110
Shiny.

222
00:12:47,196 --> 00:12:48,364
Tammy, Lou Ann, you're gonna die.

223
00:12:48,447 --> 00:12:50,741
Speaking of cameras,
did you have a nice nap?

224
00:12:50,824 --> 00:12:51,867
If you'd do your job,

225
00:12:51,951 --> 00:12:53,702
my daughter wouldn't have to fight
to be visible.

226
00:12:53,786 --> 00:12:56,413
I gotta show some of the
other kids once in a while.

227
00:12:56,497 --> 00:12:58,582
You know, this is a small city.

228
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,000
There aren't that many stations.

229
00:13:00,501 --> 00:13:01,544
This time next year,

230
00:13:01,627 --> 00:13:03,003
you could be wearing
an ill-fitting tux,

231
00:13:03,087 --> 00:13:04,630
snapping bar mitzvah photos.

232
00:13:06,173 --> 00:13:07,299
I don't know.

233
00:13:14,348 --> 00:13:15,558
Show Link.

234
00:13:15,641 --> 00:13:17,435
This is nuts. She can't even dance.

235
00:13:17,977 --> 00:13:19,520
Plastic little spastic.

236
00:13:20,188 --> 00:13:23,232
Oh, Link.
I can dance so much better than her.

237
00:13:23,816 --> 00:13:26,110
- Why don't you notice me at school?
- Mm-hmm.

238
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,281
<i>Ooh</i>

239
00:13:32,241 --> 00:13:33,368
Hey.

240
00:13:33,451 --> 00:13:36,454
That was our very own Link Larkin
singing <i>It Takes Two</i>.

241
00:13:36,537 --> 00:13:38,623
And I'm Motormouth Maybelle
reminding,

242
00:13:38,706 --> 00:13:41,751
the last Tuesday of this month's
your rhythm and blues day.

243
00:13:41,834 --> 00:13:44,420
That's right!
Negro Day will be coming your way.

244
00:13:44,504 --> 00:13:46,464
So don't... Uh...

245
00:13:47,006 --> 00:13:48,258
Over here.

246
00:13:49,217 --> 00:13:50,260
Thank you.

247
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,555
<i>So, catch all the crooning
when you're all set and tune in.</i>

248
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:55,473
<i>Thank you, Motormouth. And now...</i>

249
00:13:55,557 --> 00:13:57,225
Owner's coming.
He'll call my mother again. Let's go!

250
00:13:57,308 --> 00:13:59,352
<i>- ...very own fun-loving...</i>
- Hey!

251
00:13:59,436 --> 00:14:00,770
<i>Come on up here, Brenda.
Brenda will be taking...</i>

252
00:14:00,854 --> 00:14:01,896
What?

253
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,773
...a leave of absence from the show.
How long you gonna be gone, Brenda?

254
00:14:04,983 --> 00:14:06,234
Just nine months.

255
00:14:07,194 --> 00:14:09,112
Seems like we'll have an opening
here on the show for a girl

256
00:14:09,196 --> 00:14:12,199
just as fun-loving,
but maybe not quite as freewheeling.

257
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:14,701
Wanna be one
of the nicest kids in town?

258
00:14:14,785 --> 00:14:18,080
Cut school tomorrow and come down
to station WYZT to audition.

259
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:24,836
- No.
- But, Ma.

260
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,257
Don't test me, Tracy Turnblad.
My diet pill's wearing off.

261
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,133
But come on!

262
00:14:30,217 --> 00:14:33,011
No one is auditioning for anything
in this household.

263
00:14:33,095 --> 00:14:34,721
But why not? Why not?

264
00:14:34,805 --> 00:14:36,431
Because dancing is not your future.

265
00:14:36,515 --> 00:14:39,518
One day, you're gonna own
Edna's Occidental Laundry.

266
00:14:40,686 --> 00:14:42,354
I don't wanna be a laundress.

267
00:14:42,438 --> 00:14:43,564
I wanna be famous!

268
00:14:43,647 --> 00:14:44,857
Look, if you wanna be famous,

269
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,859
learn how to take blood
outta car upholstery.

270
00:14:46,942 --> 00:14:48,652
That's a skill you can take
right to the bank.

271
00:14:48,736 --> 00:14:51,363
- Hey. What's all the ruckus in here?
- Not a word.

272
00:14:51,447 --> 00:14:53,949
Daddy, tomorrow I'm auditioning
to dance on a TV show.

273
00:14:54,033 --> 00:14:55,534
- No, she is not!
- You are?

274
00:14:55,618 --> 00:14:57,119
First the hair, now this?

275
00:14:57,203 --> 00:14:59,205
But all the kids
are batting up their hair now, hon.

276
00:14:59,288 --> 00:15:01,165
- You're no help.
- It's "ratting," Daddy.

277
00:15:01,248 --> 00:15:03,292
And our first lady,
Jacqueline Kennedy, does it.

278
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,543
I don't believe that.

279
00:15:04,627 --> 00:15:05,836
What do you mean
you don't believe that?

280
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,338
- I don't.
- How else would it look that way?

281
00:15:07,421 --> 00:15:09,590
I believe that it is naturally stiff.

282
00:15:09,924 --> 00:15:12,385
She doesn't understand anything.

283
00:15:12,468 --> 00:15:15,221
- Dancing on that show is my dream.
- I know.

284
00:15:15,304 --> 00:15:16,806
Just because
she wouldn't know a dream

285
00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:17,932
if it bit her on the nose!

286
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,601
Well, I have information
for you, missy.

287
00:15:20,685 --> 00:15:23,980
I once had a dream that I owned
a coin-operated laundromat,

288
00:15:24,063 --> 00:15:27,066
and I came down from that cloud
real quickly, I'll tell you that.

289
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,192
No!

290
00:15:28,276 --> 00:15:29,569
- Oh, Wilbur.
- Fine! I'm going to my room!

291
00:15:29,652 --> 00:15:31,696
She thinks I'm being mean,
but I'm not.

292
00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:32,822
Those TV people,

293
00:15:32,905 --> 00:15:36,784
they don't pick people like Tracy
or... girls like us.

294
00:15:37,744 --> 00:15:39,412
They're gonna hurt her, Wilbur.

295
00:15:40,371 --> 00:15:41,623
I'll talk to her.

296
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,959
Okay. Talk to her.

297
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:50,131
I'll talk to her. Don't you worry.

298
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:51,257
Okay.

299
00:15:53,134 --> 00:15:54,177
What?

300
00:15:58,723 --> 00:16:02,185
Tracy, this TV thing.
You really want it?

301
00:16:02,811 --> 00:16:03,937
With all my heart.

302
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,355
Then you go for it!

303
00:16:06,189 --> 00:16:07,899
This is America, babe.

304
00:16:07,983 --> 00:16:09,568
You gotta think big to be big.

305
00:16:09,651 --> 00:16:11,987
Big ain't the problem
in this family, Wilbur.

306
00:16:12,863 --> 00:16:14,239
You follow your dream.

307
00:16:15,365 --> 00:16:16,616
Mine came true,

308
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,578
and now, I have
the most precious thing in the world.

309
00:16:21,496 --> 00:16:23,415
The Taj Mahal of joke shops.

310
00:16:28,962 --> 00:16:30,672
Back step, cha-cha-cha.

311
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,466
Side step, front step.

312
00:16:32,549 --> 00:16:34,218
Back and turn.

313
00:16:34,301 --> 00:16:36,053
Front step, cha-cha-cha.

314
00:16:36,136 --> 00:16:37,805
Tammy, sharper.

315
00:16:37,888 --> 00:16:39,640
Side step, front step.

316
00:16:39,723 --> 00:16:41,892
Back, again. Front step.

317
00:16:41,975 --> 00:16:44,603
Oh, my god, Penny.
There's Link. Link!

318
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:46,355
Penny, pinch me!

319
00:16:47,982 --> 00:16:49,525
You told me to.

320
00:16:50,067 --> 00:16:52,069
I can't believe
I'm really here auditioning.

321
00:16:52,152 --> 00:16:53,195
- Side step, front step.
- I can't believe I'm really here

322
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,780
watching you audition.

323
00:16:55,823 --> 00:16:57,616
Front step, cha-cha-cha.

324
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,326
Back step, cha-cha-cha.

325
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,496
Side step, front step, back and...

326
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,374
Oh, Amber, look at this motley crew.

327
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,585
This town sure has gone downhill

328
00:17:07,668 --> 00:17:09,712
since I was crowned
Miss Baltimore Crabs.

329
00:17:10,212 --> 00:17:13,549
<i>Oh, my god, how times have changed</i>

330
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:17,053
<i>These girls must be blind
Or completely deranged</i>

331
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:19,013
<i>But time seemed to halt</i>

332
00:17:19,096 --> 00:17:22,016
<i>When I was Miss Baltimore Crabs</i>

333
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:24,102
Amber, that move is far too dirty.

334
00:17:24,185 --> 00:17:26,104
Mother, wake up
from that dream of yours.

335
00:17:26,187 --> 00:17:28,147
This isn't 1930.

336
00:17:28,231 --> 00:17:31,109
<i>You can laugh but life's a test</i>

337
00:17:31,192 --> 00:17:32,819
<i>Don't do this, don't do that</i>

338
00:17:32,902 --> 00:17:35,071
<i>Remember, Mother knows best</i>

339
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,823
<i>For the crown's in the vault</i>

340
00:17:36,906 --> 00:17:40,118
<i>From when I won Miss Baltimore Crabs</i>

341
00:17:40,201 --> 00:17:41,953
<i>These steps are perfect ammunition</i>

342
00:17:42,036 --> 00:17:45,957
<i>Let me show you how your mommy dear
Took out the competition</i>

343
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,751
Girls, go get them.

344
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:49,419
Boys, let's rumba.

345
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:52,964
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

346
00:17:53,048 --> 00:17:56,635
<i>Those poor runner-ups
Might still hold some grudges</i>

347
00:17:56,718 --> 00:18:00,138
<i>They padded their cups
But I screwed the judges</i>

348
00:18:00,221 --> 00:18:01,973
<i>Those broads thought they'd win</i>

349
00:18:02,057 --> 00:18:05,060
<i>If a plate
They would spin in their dance</i>

350
00:18:06,228 --> 00:18:07,687
<i>Not a chance</i>

351
00:18:07,771 --> 00:18:09,231
<i>Boys, put me down</i>

352
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:12,776
Good morning, ladies.
Let's see what you got.

353
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:16,530
<i>Twist, twist, twist, twist
Mashed potato, mambo</i>

354
00:18:16,613 --> 00:18:17,864
<i>Ready, begin</i>

355
00:18:17,948 --> 00:18:21,285
<i>On my show you'll never find
A thrusting hip or bump and grind</i>

356
00:18:21,368 --> 00:18:23,161
<i>What's that
A dance for fleas and ticks?</i>

357
00:18:23,245 --> 00:18:24,955
<i>Oh, you should have seen
My bag of tricks</i>

358
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:28,876
<i>Oh, I hit the stage batons ablaze</i>

359
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:32,337
<i>While belting Aida
And preparing soufflés</i>

360
00:18:32,421 --> 00:18:34,173
<i>But that triple somersault</i>

361
00:18:34,256 --> 00:18:39,261
<i>Is how I clinched
Miss Baltimore Crabs</i>

362
00:19:06,956 --> 00:19:07,999
Proceed.

363
00:19:08,082 --> 00:19:09,792
<i>Are you scared we're on live?</i>

364
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,627
<i>No, I'm sure I can cope</i>

365
00:19:11,711 --> 00:19:14,046
<i>Well, this show isn't broadcast in...</i>

366
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:15,172
<i>- Cinemascope
- Cinemascope</i>

367
00:19:15,256 --> 00:19:17,341
<i>I never drank one chocolate malt</i>

368
00:19:17,425 --> 00:19:21,012
<i>No desserts for Miss Baltimore Crabs</i>

369
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:25,892
<i>This one will never get a date
In those hand-me-down clothes</i>

370
00:19:25,975 --> 00:19:29,687
<i>Ha! Kid, she'll never get a date
Till Daddy buys her a new nose</i>

371
00:19:29,771 --> 00:19:31,564
<i>I would say, "Oy gevalt"</i>

372
00:19:31,648 --> 00:19:35,151
<i>If I wasn't Miss Baltimore Crabs</i>

373
00:19:36,778 --> 00:19:38,446
<i>Do you dance like you dress?</i>

374
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:40,240
<i>Amber, there's no need to be cruel</i>

375
00:19:40,323 --> 00:19:42,992
<i>Would you swim in an integrated pool?</i>

376
00:19:43,785 --> 00:19:46,287
I sure would.
I'm all for integration.

377
00:19:46,371 --> 00:19:48,331
It's the new frontier!

378
00:19:48,415 --> 00:19:50,250
Not in Baltimore, it isn't.

379
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:51,960
And may I be frank?

380
00:19:52,043 --> 00:19:53,712
<i>First impressions can be tough</i>

381
00:19:53,795 --> 00:19:55,547
<i>And when I saw you, I knew it</i>

382
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:59,342
<i>If your size weren't enough
Your last answer just blew it</i>

383
00:19:59,426 --> 00:20:02,929
<i>And so, my dear, so short and stout</i>

384
00:20:03,013 --> 00:20:04,347
<i>You'll never be in</i>

385
00:20:04,431 --> 00:20:06,516
<i>- So we're kicking you out
- So we're kicking you out</i>

386
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,518
<i>With your form and your face</i>

387
00:20:08,602 --> 00:20:10,103
<i>Aw, well, it isn't your fault</i>

388
00:20:10,187 --> 00:20:11,563
<i>You're just down with a case</i>

389
00:20:11,646 --> 00:20:19,029
<i>Of Miss Baltimore Crabs</i>

390
00:20:20,864 --> 00:20:22,199
You may go.

391
00:20:22,282 --> 00:20:24,326
Um, thank you?

392
00:20:28,997 --> 00:20:30,707
I think they secretly liked you.

393
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,806
Cutting my class, Tracy Turnblad?

394
00:20:45,889 --> 00:20:49,018
I trust it was something
really important.

395
00:20:49,101 --> 00:20:50,352
It should've been.

396
00:21:15,336 --> 00:21:17,129
<i>There's a party grooving
Let's get down</i>

397
00:21:17,213 --> 00:21:19,423
- What you looking at?
- Nothing. Not you.

398
00:21:24,554 --> 00:21:25,972
Can I help you?

399
00:21:26,055 --> 00:21:27,598
That move's swift.

400
00:21:27,682 --> 00:21:28,725
You got that right.

401
00:21:29,225 --> 00:21:31,144
The man can dine me
on a diet of detention,

402
00:21:31,227 --> 00:21:33,563
so long as he don't starve me
of my tunes, baby.

403
00:21:34,314 --> 00:21:36,024
- Does that dance have a name?
- Oh, this?

404
00:21:36,566 --> 00:21:38,902
Call it
the "Peyton Place After Midnight."

405
00:21:38,985 --> 00:21:42,280
I use it to attract, uh,
the opposite sex.

406
00:21:42,363 --> 00:21:43,448
Wow.

407
00:21:44,491 --> 00:21:46,785
That is so groovy.

408
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:54,834
You're really good.

409
00:21:54,918 --> 00:21:55,961
Why, thank you.

410
00:21:56,044 --> 00:21:59,548
So, would it be kinda like this?

411
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,925
You can't do that dance.

412
00:22:02,008 --> 00:22:03,093
Hello, now.

413
00:22:03,176 --> 00:22:04,594
Not bad for a white chick.

414
00:22:06,805 --> 00:22:08,974
Hey, I know
where I've seen you before.

415
00:22:09,057 --> 00:22:10,767
- Where?
- On Corny's show on Negro Day.

416
00:22:10,851 --> 00:22:13,645
Negro Day's the best.
I wish every day were Negro Day.

417
00:22:14,104 --> 00:22:16,273
At our house, it is.

418
00:22:18,609 --> 00:22:19,901
Hey.

419
00:22:19,985 --> 00:22:21,194
Show me another one?

420
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,863
You wanna see another one.

421
00:22:22,946 --> 00:22:26,200
Well, here's a little
something signified to say,

422
00:22:26,283 --> 00:22:28,702
"Hello, my name is Seaweed...

423
00:22:29,953 --> 00:22:31,038
J,

424
00:22:31,747 --> 00:22:32,790
Stubbs."

425
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:34,416
What's yours, baby?

426
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:39,463
I'm Tracy Turnblad!

427
00:22:40,047 --> 00:22:41,924
You're gonna get it, white girl!

428
00:22:42,716 --> 00:22:43,968
Well, Tracy,

429
00:22:44,051 --> 00:22:45,928
you got it going on, girl.
You one of us.

430
00:22:46,345 --> 00:22:50,015
You're joining this program
already in progress!

431
00:22:50,975 --> 00:22:52,226
Well, let's go.

432
00:23:11,537 --> 00:23:13,372
No, I get who Caesar is.

433
00:23:13,456 --> 00:23:14,832
But what's the "Ideas of March"?

434
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:17,168
I mean, how can a month have an idea?

435
00:23:18,336 --> 00:23:19,378
Hold on.

436
00:23:19,462 --> 00:23:20,505
Come on.

437
00:23:30,223 --> 00:23:31,808
How you liking detention now?

438
00:23:31,891 --> 00:23:35,854
I'm a bad, bad girl
who needs to be punished.

439
00:23:42,485 --> 00:23:43,528
Hey.

440
00:23:44,696 --> 00:23:47,657
You know,
Corny's hosting the hop tomorrow.

441
00:23:49,743 --> 00:23:52,329
If he saw you dancing like that,
he'd put you on the show.

442
00:23:53,747 --> 00:23:54,789
See you.

443
00:23:56,124 --> 00:23:57,167
Sorry, little darling.

444
00:23:57,709 --> 00:23:59,252
Hope I didn't dent your 'do.

445
00:24:01,505 --> 00:24:03,423
- Hey!
- See you all later.

446
00:24:04,299 --> 00:24:06,301
Hey, Trace. I was looking for you.

447
00:24:07,052 --> 00:24:08,095
What?

448
00:24:09,137 --> 00:24:11,640
<i>I can hear the bells</i>

449
00:24:11,723 --> 00:24:13,058
What? What are you talking about?

450
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:17,187
<i>Well, don't you hear them chime?</i>

451
00:24:17,271 --> 00:24:18,730
"Chime" is not exactly
how I'd put it.

452
00:24:19,565 --> 00:24:26,321
<i>Can't you feel my heartbeat
Keeping perfect time?</i>

453
00:24:26,405 --> 00:24:33,203
<i>And all because he touched me</i>

454
00:24:33,287 --> 00:24:35,122
<i>He looked at me and stared</i>

455
00:24:35,205 --> 00:24:37,583
<i>Yes, he bumped me</i>

456
00:24:37,666 --> 00:24:39,376
<i>My heart was unprepared</i>

457
00:24:39,501 --> 00:24:41,837
<i>When he tapped me</i>

458
00:24:41,921 --> 00:24:44,131
<i>And knocked me off my feet</i>

459
00:24:44,214 --> 00:24:47,927
<i>One little touch
Now my life's complete</i>

460
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:50,346
<i>- 'Cause when he nudged me</i>
- Oh!

461
00:24:50,429 --> 00:24:52,306
<i>Love put me in a fix</i>

462
00:24:52,389 --> 00:24:54,725
<i>Yes, it hit me</i>

463
00:24:54,809 --> 00:24:56,435
<i>Just like a ton of bricks</i>

464
00:24:56,519 --> 00:24:58,688
<i>Yes, my heart burst</i>

465
00:24:58,771 --> 00:25:01,190
<i>Now I know what life's about</i>

466
00:25:01,273 --> 00:25:05,152
<i>One little touch
And love's knocked me out</i>

467
00:25:05,236 --> 00:25:07,863
<i>And I can hear the bells</i>

468
00:25:07,947 --> 00:25:10,032
<i>My head is spinning</i>

469
00:25:10,116 --> 00:25:12,076
<i>I can hear the bells</i>

470
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,287
<i>Something's beginning</i>

471
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:18,499
<i>Everybody says
That a girl who looks like me</i>

472
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:20,168
<i>Can't win his love</i>

473
00:25:20,251 --> 00:25:22,295
<i>Well, just wait and see</i>

474
00:25:22,378 --> 00:25:24,964
<i>'Cause I can hear the bells</i>

475
00:25:25,048 --> 00:25:27,133
<i>Just hear them chiming</i>

476
00:25:27,216 --> 00:25:29,177
<i>I can hear the bells</i>

477
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,304
<i>My temperature's climbing</i>

478
00:25:31,387 --> 00:25:33,181
<i>I can't contain my joy</i>

479
00:25:33,264 --> 00:25:37,894
<i>'Cause I finally found the boy
I've been missing</i>

480
00:25:37,977 --> 00:25:43,608
<i>Listen, I can hear the bells</i>

481
00:25:44,859 --> 00:25:46,194
<i>Round one</i>

482
00:25:46,277 --> 00:25:49,072
<i>He'll ask me on a date, and then</i>

483
00:25:49,155 --> 00:25:50,490
<i>Round two</i>

484
00:25:50,573 --> 00:25:53,326
<i>I'll primp but won't be late because</i>

485
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:56,997
<i>Round three
Is when we kiss inside his car</i>

486
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,626
<i>Won't go all the way
but I'll go pretty far</i>

487
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:03,420
<i>Round four</i>

488
00:26:03,503 --> 00:26:06,214
<i>He'll ask me for my hand and then</i>

489
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:07,674
<i>Round five</i>

490
00:26:07,758 --> 00:26:10,427
<i>We'll book the wedding band so by</i>

491
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,553
<i>Round six</i>

492
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:14,097
<i>Amber, much to your surprise</i>

493
00:26:14,181 --> 00:26:18,101
<i>This heavyweight champion
Takes the prize</i>

494
00:26:18,185 --> 00:26:20,729
<i>And I can hear the bells</i>

495
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:22,981
<i>My ears are ringing</i>

496
00:26:23,065 --> 00:26:24,858
<i>I can hear the bells</i>

497
00:26:24,942 --> 00:26:27,111
<i>The bridesmaids are singing</i>

498
00:26:27,194 --> 00:26:31,365
<i>Everybody says
That a guy who's such a gem</i>

499
00:26:31,448 --> 00:26:32,950
<i>Won't look my way</i>

500
00:26:33,033 --> 00:26:35,285
<i>Well, the laugh's on them</i>

501
00:26:35,369 --> 00:26:37,705
<i>'Cause I can hear the bells</i>

502
00:26:37,788 --> 00:26:39,999
<i>My father will smile</i>

503
00:26:40,082 --> 00:26:41,709
<i>I can hear the bells</i>

504
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:44,211
<i>As he walks me down the aisle</i>

505
00:26:44,295 --> 00:26:46,005
<i>My mother starts to cry</i>

506
00:26:46,088 --> 00:26:50,676
<i>But I can't see 'cause Link and I
Are French kissing</i>

507
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:56,474
<i>Listen, I can hear the bells</i>

508
00:26:56,557 --> 00:26:57,600
Yeah.

509
00:27:01,562 --> 00:27:03,564
<i>I can hear the bells</i>

510
00:27:03,648 --> 00:27:05,858
<i>My head is reeling</i>

511
00:27:05,942 --> 00:27:07,735
<i>I can hear the bells</i>

512
00:27:07,818 --> 00:27:10,112
<i>I can't stop the pealing</i>

513
00:27:10,196 --> 00:27:14,117
<i>Everybody warns
That he won't like what he'll see</i>

514
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,246
<i>But I know that he'll look
Inside of me</i>

515
00:27:18,329 --> 00:27:20,581
<i>Yeah, I can hear the bells</i>

516
00:27:20,665 --> 00:27:23,084
<i>Today's just the start 'cause</i>

517
00:27:23,167 --> 00:27:24,669
<i>I can hear the bells</i>

518
00:27:24,752 --> 00:27:27,255
<i>Until death do us part and</i>

519
00:27:27,338 --> 00:27:31,259
<i>Even when we die
We'll look down from up above</i>

520
00:27:31,342 --> 00:27:35,597
<i>Remembering the night
That we two fell in love</i>

521
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,515
<i>We both will shed a tear</i>

522
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:42,312
<i>And he'll whisper
As we're reminiscing</i>

523
00:27:42,395 --> 00:27:47,942
<i>- Listen, I can hear the bells
- She can hear the bells</i>

524
00:27:48,026 --> 00:27:53,823
<i>- I can hear the bells
- She can hear the bells</i>

00:27:53,907 --> 00:28:02,249
<i>- I can hear the bells
- Bum, bum, bum</i>

526
00:28:14,553 --> 00:28:16,972
<i>Hey, little girl
With the cash to burn</i>

527
00:28:18,515 --> 00:28:21,310
<i>Well, I'm selling something
You won't return</i>

528
00:28:22,686 --> 00:28:25,272
<i>Hey, little girl
Take me off the shelf</i>

529
00:28:26,565 --> 00:28:29,485
<i>'Cause it's hard having fun
Playing with yourself</i>

530
00:28:30,986 --> 00:28:32,863
<i>Once you bounce
Through the whole selection</i>

531
00:28:32,946 --> 00:28:35,032
<i>Shake those hips in my direction</i>

532
00:28:35,115 --> 00:28:36,992
<i>Prettier package you never did see</i>

533
00:28:37,076 --> 00:28:38,994
<i>Take me home and then unwrap me</i>

534
00:28:39,078 --> 00:28:42,498
<i>Shop around but, little darling
I've got to be</i>

535
00:28:42,581 --> 00:28:44,625
<i>The ladies' choice</i>

536
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:46,669
<i>Ladies' choice</i>

<i>The ladies' choice</i>

538
00:28:50,881 --> 00:28:52,425
Go on. Get out there and show them.

539
00:28:52,508 --> 00:28:53,884
It's packed pretty tight.

540
00:28:53,968 --> 00:28:55,469
Okay, I'll go in front of you
and I'll push.

541
00:28:55,553 --> 00:28:58,431
<i>Test drive this American male</i>

542
00:28:58,514 --> 00:28:59,557
Wait.

543
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,684
<i>It's gonna take cash to fill my tank</i>

544
00:29:01,767 --> 00:29:03,519
<i>It's gonna take cash to fill my tank</i>

545
00:29:03,603 --> 00:29:05,479
<i>So let's crack open your piggy bank</i>

546
00:29:05,563 --> 00:29:07,940
Hey, Seaweed!
Wanna do Peyton Place for Corny?

547
00:29:08,024 --> 00:29:09,692
Are you crazy?
You gotta dance with your crowd,

548
00:29:09,775 --> 00:29:11,569
- I gotta dance with mine.
- Why?

549
00:29:11,652 --> 00:29:12,945
It's just the way it is, Tracy.

550
00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:14,280
But it's your dance.

551
00:29:14,363 --> 00:29:15,907
Well, how 'bout you go
borrow it for a second.

552
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,909
- Really?
- Go get it, girl.

553
00:29:19,535 --> 00:29:21,579

What is she doing?

557
00:29:34,175 --> 00:29:36,052
All right! Yeah!

558
00:29:44,811 --> 00:29:46,521
<i>Hey, little girl on a spending spree</i>

559
00:29:46,604 --> 00:29:48,565
<i>I don't come cheap
But the kisses come free</i>

560
00:29:48,648 --> 00:29:52,193
<i>On closer inspection
I'm sure that you'll agree</i>

561
00:29:52,652 --> 00:29:54,905
<i>Oh, hey, little girl,
Listen to my plea</i>

562
00:29:54,988 --> 00:29:57,073
<i>I come with a lifetime guarantee</i>

563
00:29:57,157 --> 00:30:00,494

That baby makes three</i>

00:30:17,636 --> 00:30:20,138
Mr And Mrs Turnblad!

570
00:30:22,307 --> 00:30:23,559
Hey, look out!

571
00:30:25,477 --> 00:30:26,937
Mrs Turnblad!

572
00:30:29,022 --> 00:30:30,941
Mr Turnblad, come quick!

573
00:30:31,025 --> 00:30:32,401
- Me?
- Come on!

574
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:36,530
Mrs Turnblad! Come quick!

575
00:30:36,614 --> 00:30:37,656
You gotta see this!

576
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,366
Oh, I read all about it.

577
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:41,827
- It's a big fake Hollywood set.
- No, Mrs...

578
00:30:41,911 --> 00:30:44,038
You think I'm gonna think
that he's really up there?

579
00:30:44,121 --> 00:30:46,207
It's not John Glenn, Mrs Turnblad!

580
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:48,000
- Well, why are we watching this?
- Just watch.

581
00:30:48,083 --> 00:30:49,126
<i>- Lou Ann!
- Joey!</i>

582
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:50,419

00:30:50,503 --> 00:30:51,545

586
00:30:54,548 --> 00:30:56,258
<i>And I'm Tracy!</i>

587
00:30:57,885 --> 00:30:59,053
- Oh! Oh, my!
- She...

588
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:01,597
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

589
00:31:01,681 --> 00:31:05,142
<i>And the bass and drums
Are pounding in your head</i>

590
00:31:05,226 --> 00:31:06,269
Go, Tracy!

591
00:31:06,352 --> 00:31:07,645
- Go, go, Tracy!
- Go, go, Tracy!

592
00:31:07,728 --> 00:31:10,314
<i>Who cares about sleep
When you can snooze in school</i>

593
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:12,984

594

<i>Don't need a cap and a gown</i>

595
00:31:14,444 --> 00:31:16,904

00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:23,661
<i>Kids in town</i>

597
00:31:23,745 --> 00:31:25,038
<i>- Whoo!
- Whoo!</i>

598
00:31:25,121 --> 00:31:27,123
Yeah! That was the dance of the week.

599
00:31:27,206 --> 00:31:29,209
I don't know what happened,
Mr Spritzer.

600
00:31:29,292 --> 00:31:32,420
Corny had some sort of aneurysm
or something, and...

601
00:31:33,087 --> 00:31:34,130
picked her.

602
00:31:34,214 --> 00:31:36,841
...brand-new Council Member,
Miss Tracy Turnblad.

603
00:31:36,925 --> 00:31:37,967
So, Trace,

604
00:31:38,051 --> 00:31:40,303
come on, cosy up to old Corny
and tell us about yourself.

605
00:31:40,387 --> 00:31:42,555
Well, I watch <i>The Corny Collins Show,</i>

606
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:44,432
and I do absolutely nothing else!

607
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,144
Oh, Wilbur, to think that
I almost stopped her,

608
00:31:48,228 --> 00:31:49,604
from reaching for the stars.

609
00:31:49,688 --> 00:31:52,858
And now,
here she is on local daytime TV.

610
00:31:52,941 --> 00:31:54,192
She's gonna be a regular!

611
00:31:54,651 --> 00:31:58,488
Imagine, my little girl,
regular at last.

612
00:31:58,572 --> 00:32:00,699
I also hope
to be the first woman president

613
00:32:00,782 --> 00:32:02,117
or a Rockette!

614
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,952
And if you were president, Tracy,

615
00:32:04,036 --> 00:32:05,746
what would your first
official act be?

616
00:32:07,622 --> 00:32:09,833
I'd make every day Negro Day.

617
00:32:11,293 --> 00:32:13,795
I read you
like tomorrow's headlines, Tracy.

618
00:32:13,879 --> 00:32:14,922
What do you think, kids?

619
00:32:15,005 --> 00:32:16,340
You think we might have
a hot new candidate

620
00:32:16,423 --> 00:32:17,841
for Miss Teenage Hairspray?

621
00:32:17,925 --> 00:32:19,885
That's only the dream of my life.

622
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,804
But Miss Hairspray is mine.

623
00:32:21,887 --> 00:32:23,055
Uh, we're on the air.

624
00:32:23,138 --> 00:32:25,307
And your dream
will be coming to you, sweetheart,

625
00:32:25,391 --> 00:32:28,435
Saturday, June 2nd,
right here on WYZT.

626
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:30,604
You have to vote for a person, Corny,
not one of the Himalayas.

627
00:32:30,688 --> 00:32:31,897
Hi, Penny.

628
00:32:31,981 --> 00:32:33,399
Always the charmer, Amber.

629
00:32:35,526 --> 00:32:38,612
I want that chubby communist girl
off the show!

630
00:32:38,696 --> 00:32:41,323
Well, let me be the first
to toss the harpoon.

631
00:32:41,407 --> 00:32:42,533
She's a corrupting influence!

632
00:32:42,616 --> 00:32:46,203
I agree. We don't want our dancers
thrusting like savages!

633
00:32:46,287 --> 00:32:47,747
Hey, speak for yourself.

634
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:48,998
Don't get flip with me.

635
00:32:49,081 --> 00:32:50,291
I'm not.

636
00:32:50,374 --> 00:32:52,168
Look, now I got some new ideas
for the show.

637
00:32:52,251 --> 00:32:53,878
First, we get rid of Negro Day.

638
00:32:53,961 --> 00:32:55,421
Finally, some sense outta you.

639
00:32:55,504 --> 00:32:57,465
And we mix those kids in
with the rest of the Council.

640
00:32:57,548 --> 00:32:58,758
Mix those kids?

641
00:32:58,841 --> 00:32:59,884
That's right, I said it.

642
00:33:00,009 --> 00:33:02,011
This is not a black-and-tan cocktail!

643
00:33:02,094 --> 00:33:03,304
Well, why couldn't it be?

644
00:33:03,387 --> 00:33:05,515
Velma, isn't this where
it's all heading anyway?

645
00:33:06,015 --> 00:33:08,226
Now, you can fight it
or you can rock out to it.

646
00:33:08,351 --> 00:33:10,478
Maybe it is time
for some fresh ideas,

647
00:33:10,561 --> 00:33:13,564
like, like a nice, fresh new host!

648
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,902
Gee, Velma,
how do you fire Corny Collins,

649
00:33:17,986 --> 00:33:19,362
from <i>The Corny Collins Show?</i>

650
00:33:21,572 --> 00:33:23,783
They do it all the time on Lassie!

651
00:33:23,866 --> 00:33:26,077
Velma, you've let this go too far!

652
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,579
- Me?
- Fix it!

653
00:33:27,662 --> 00:33:29,122
- What?
- Fix it!

654
00:33:32,834 --> 00:33:36,713
<i>Hey, look out for that moving van
Driving down our streets</i>

655
00:33:36,796 --> 00:33:38,631
<i>You better lock up your man</i>

656
00:33:38,715 --> 00:33:41,926
<i>Before he meets the new girl in town</i>

657
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:43,845
<i>Who just came on the scene,</i>

658
00:33:43,928 --> 00:33:46,389
TracyFace whoopee cushion.
Good choice.

659
00:33:46,473 --> 00:33:48,934
We got your Tracy souvenirs for days.

660
00:33:49,017 --> 00:33:51,144
Here, your signed photos.

661
00:33:52,395 --> 00:33:53,522
Tracy wigs.

662
00:33:53,605 --> 00:33:55,065
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa</i>

663
00:33:55,148 --> 00:34:00,862
<i>We don't know what to do
'Bout the new girl in town</i>

664
00:34:02,322 --> 00:34:05,993
<i>The new girl in town
Seems to dance on air</i>

665
00:34:06,076 --> 00:34:07,285
<i>The new girl in town</i>

666
00:34:07,369 --> 00:34:09,663
<i>She's got the coolest hair</i>

667
00:34:09,746 --> 00:34:15,127
<i>You better tell the homecoming queen
To hold onto her crown</i>

668
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:16,962
<i>Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa</i>

669
00:34:17,045 --> 00:34:20,966
<i>Or she's gonna lose it to
The new girl in town</i>

670
00:34:21,049 --> 00:34:24,595
That big little girl
is sending my sales through the roof.

671
00:34:24,678 --> 00:34:27,389
More people are breathing aerosol
than oxygen!

672
00:34:27,473 --> 00:34:29,224
Do you think you could show us
some of those new dance moves?

673
00:34:29,308 --> 00:34:31,185
- Yeah, sure.
- Ooh, pretty flowers.

674
00:34:31,268 --> 00:34:32,519
Tracy, wait up!

675
00:34:34,313 --> 00:34:35,356
<i>She's hip</i>

676
00:34:36,148 --> 00:34:37,316
<i>So cool</i>

677
00:34:38,025 --> 00:34:41,654
<i>I'm gonna get her after school</i>

678
00:34:41,737 --> 00:34:44,740
<i>And yet we'd like to be like her</i>

679
00:34:44,824 --> 00:34:48,953
<i>'Cause she's the kitten
That the cats prefer</i>

680

682
00:34:56,544 --> 00:34:58,170
<i>I can't stop crying</i>

683
00:34:58,254 --> 00:35:01,966
<i>And so in my own tears
I'm gonna drown</i>

684
00:35:02,049 --> 00:35:03,759
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa</i>

685
00:35:03,843 --> 00:35:07,638
<i>'Cause he wants to rendezvous

<i>We're kinda sad and blue</i>

687
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:11,267
<i>Yes, it's true, girl</i>

688
00:35:11,392 --> 00:35:13,144
<i>We'd like to say</i>

689
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:17,398
<i>To the new girl in town</i>

690
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:20,610
<i>The new girl in town</i>

691
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,615
Hi, I'm here to see Tracy Turnblad.

692
00:35:26,699 --> 00:35:27,826
Where's her write-up?

693
00:35:27,909 --> 00:35:30,328
She doesn't need a detention slip.
She's with me.

694
00:35:33,373 --> 00:35:35,250
Penny, this is Seaweed.
Seaweed, this is Penny.

<i>To the new girl in town</i>

697
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:53,685
<i>The new girl in town</i>

698
00:35:53,768 --> 00:35:55,812
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa</i>

699
00:35:55,896 --> 00:35:57,689
<i>From out of the blue, girl</i>

700
00:35:57,773 --> 00:35:59,649
<i>This town's in a stew, girl</i>

701
00:35:59,733 --> 00:36:01,276
<i>What a hullabaloo, girl</i>

702
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,362
<i>She ain't just passing through, girl</i>

703
00:36:03,445 --> 00:36:05,155
<i>She's sticking like glue, girl</i>

704
00:36:05,238 --> 00:36:06,782
<i>To the man I thought I knew, girl</i>

705
00:36:06,865 --> 00:36:08,450
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa</i>

706
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:10,410
<i>Hey, look out for that moving van</i>

707
00:36:10,494 --> 00:36:12,621
<i>Look out, look out, look out</i>

708
00:36:13,747 --> 00:36:18,043
<i>She was the new girl in</i>

709
00:36:18,961 --> 00:36:21,380
<i>Town</i>

710
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:28,429
And that's the way you do it.

711
00:36:28,512 --> 00:36:30,973
And I'm your fabled
Miss Motormouth Maybelle,

712
00:36:31,056 --> 00:36:34,059
your DJ <i>du jour</i>,
pitching rhythm your way.

713
00:36:34,143 --> 00:36:37,354
So, hey, better stay
and shimmy and sway.

714
00:36:37,438 --> 00:36:40,024
We'll be right back
with more Negro Day.

715
00:36:40,107 --> 00:36:41,775
"Brought to you by...

716
00:36:41,859 --> 00:36:44,278
Nap-a-Way, for stubborn hair.

717
00:36:46,739 --> 00:36:49,533
Every kink will be gone in a blink."

718
00:36:51,285 --> 00:36:52,328
We're off.

719
00:36:58,918 --> 00:36:59,961
Girls, that was great.

720
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:02,839
How dare you pick the same song?

721
00:37:03,214 --> 00:37:04,257
They wrote it.

722
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,675
You watch yourself.

723
00:37:05,758 --> 00:37:08,386
You are one inch
from being cancelled.

724
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:10,513
You know what your demographic is?

725
00:37:10,596 --> 00:37:12,932
Cleaning ladies and lawn jockeys.

726
00:37:19,689 --> 00:37:21,649
A foot in the door, that's all it is.

727
00:37:22,275 --> 00:37:23,902
One toe at a time.

728
00:37:28,656 --> 00:37:29,699
Hello?

729
00:37:30,366 --> 00:37:32,535
Is this the Turnblad residence?

730
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:35,538
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Mr Pinky speaking.

731
00:37:35,622 --> 00:37:38,833
Mr Pinky from... from the dress shop?

732
00:37:38,917 --> 00:37:40,168
Uh-huh.

733
00:37:40,251 --> 00:37:41,544
<i>I'd like Tracy for our spokesgirl.</i>

734
00:37:41,628 --> 00:37:42,796
You want Tracy to do what?

735
00:37:42,879 --> 00:37:44,923
<i>- Be our spokesgirl.</i>
- Be a spokesgirl?

736
00:37:45,006 --> 00:37:46,216
<i>I think she'd be perfect.</i>

737
00:37:47,008 --> 00:37:49,511
<i>I'd like to meet her
and discuss the details.</i>

738
00:37:49,594 --> 00:37:51,221
<i>As soon as possible.</i>

739
00:37:51,304 --> 00:37:52,347
Okay, um...

740
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:54,224
Well, we'll have
to send someone down to meet you.

741
00:37:54,307 --> 00:37:55,809
<i>- Tonight, if you can.</i>
- So, um...

742
00:37:55,892 --> 00:37:58,854
- Oh, okay. Bye-bye, Mr Pinky.
<i>- Bye-bye.</i>

743
00:37:58,937 --> 00:38:00,480
The Mr Pinky?

744
00:38:00,564 --> 00:38:02,441
From Mr Pinky's hefty hideaway!

745
00:38:02,524 --> 00:38:03,900
A spokesgirl?

746
00:38:03,984 --> 00:38:05,944
Oh, tell me I get a free caftan.
Tell me!

747
00:38:06,028 --> 00:38:07,070
Oh, Tracy!

748
00:38:07,154 --> 00:38:10,407
I think perks like caftans
have to be negotiated.

749
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:12,117
Maybe we should get you an agent.

750
00:38:12,201 --> 00:38:14,244
Okay. You be my agent!

751
00:38:14,328 --> 00:38:16,413
What? Tracy Turnblad!

752
00:38:16,497 --> 00:38:18,832
Has fame gone to your head
and made you wacky?

753
00:38:18,916 --> 00:38:20,167
Well, why not?

754
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,294
Who's going to look out for me
better than my mom?

755
00:38:22,378 --> 00:38:23,754
Me, an agent?

756
00:38:24,254 --> 00:38:26,590
You see me hobnobbing
and drinking rum and cokes

757
00:38:26,674 --> 00:38:27,967
with all those hoi pollois?

758
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:29,635
And out-negotiating them.

759
00:38:29,718 --> 00:38:30,803
Oh, you're crazy!

760
00:38:31,929 --> 00:38:35,099
Oh, Tracy,
I haven't left this house in years.

761
00:38:35,182 --> 00:38:36,308
Then isn't it time you did?

762
00:38:36,392 --> 00:38:37,768
Oh, no, Tracy.

763
00:38:38,561 --> 00:38:40,479
We'll have your father meet with him.

764
00:38:40,563 --> 00:38:42,356
I don't wanna be seen like this.

765
00:38:43,023 --> 00:38:44,066
Why not?

766
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:46,944
I'll do it after my next diet.
That's when I'll do it.

767
00:38:47,028 --> 00:38:48,571
You see,
the neighbours haven't seen me

768
00:38:48,654 --> 00:38:50,114
since I was a size 10.

769
00:38:50,197 --> 00:38:51,699
Don't make me do it, Tracy.

770
00:38:52,283 --> 00:38:54,994
Ma, it's changing out there.

771
00:38:55,077 --> 00:38:56,537
You'll like it.

772
00:38:56,621 --> 00:38:58,039
People who are different...

773
00:38:58,122 --> 00:38:59,832
Their time is coming.

774
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:05,213
<i>Hey, Mama, hey, Mama, look around</i>

775
00:39:05,296 --> 00:39:08,299
<i>Everybody's grooving
To a brand-new sound</i>

776
00:39:08,382 --> 00:39:11,260
<i>Hey, Mama, hey, Mama follow me</i>

777
00:39:11,344 --> 00:39:13,930
<i>I know something's in you
That you wanna set free</i>

778
00:39:14,013 --> 00:39:17,016
<i>So let go, go, go of the past now</i>

779
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:20,103
<i>Say hello to the love in your heart</i>

780
00:39:20,186 --> 00:39:23,064
<i>Yes, I know
That the world's spinning fast now</i>

781
00:39:23,147 --> 00:39:25,275
<i>You gotta get yourself
A brand-new start</i>

782
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:27,861
<i>Hey, Mama, welcome to the '60s</i>

783
00:39:27,944 --> 00:39:30,905
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

784
00:39:30,989 --> 00:39:34,075
<i>Oh, Mama, welcome to the '60s</i>

785
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:36,995
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

786
00:39:37,078 --> 00:39:39,539
<i>Go, Mama, go, go, go</i>

787
00:39:40,874 --> 00:39:42,876
<i>Welcome to the '60s</i>

788
00:39:42,959 --> 00:39:44,210
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

789
00:39:44,294 --> 00:39:45,712
<i>Hey, Mama</i>

790
00:39:46,296 --> 00:39:48,632
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

791
00:39:49,257 --> 00:39:50,634
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

792
00:39:50,717 --> 00:39:53,470
<i>Hey, Mama, hey, Mama, have some fun</i>

793
00:39:53,553 --> 00:39:56,556
<i>I haven't left this house since 1951</i>

794
00:39:56,681 --> 00:39:59,309
<i>Hey, Mama, hey, Mama, take a chance</i>

795
00:39:59,393 --> 00:40:02,396
<i>Oh, Tracy, it's been years
Since someone asked me to dance</i>

796
00:40:02,479 --> 00:40:05,357
<i>So let go, go, go of the past now</i>

797
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,360
<i>Say hello to the light in your eyes</i>

798
00:40:08,443 --> 00:40:11,071
<i>Yes, I know
That the world's spinning fast now</i>

799
00:40:11,154 --> 00:40:13,782
<i>But you gotta run the race
To win the prize</i>

800
00:40:13,866 --> 00:40:16,285
<i>Hey, Mama, welcome to the '60s</i>

801
00:40:16,368 --> 00:40:19,246
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

802
00:40:19,329 --> 00:40:22,332
<i>Oh, Mama, welcome to the '60s</i>

803
00:40:22,416 --> 00:40:25,336
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

804
00:40:25,419 --> 00:40:28,047
<i>Go, Mama, go, go, go</i>

805
00:40:29,256 --> 00:40:30,925
<i>Welcome to the '60s</i>

806
00:40:31,008 --> 00:40:32,051
Ma, you did it!

807
00:40:32,134 --> 00:40:34,512
Oh, Tracy, I'm a little lightheaded.

808
00:40:34,595 --> 00:40:36,514
There's so much air out here!

809
00:40:37,306 --> 00:40:39,141
Can't we go someplace that's stuffy?

810
00:40:39,225 --> 00:40:41,268
No, Ma, you're on your way.

811
00:40:43,896 --> 00:40:46,524
<i>Hey, Mama, welcome to the '60s</i>

812
00:40:46,607 --> 00:40:49,694
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

813
00:40:49,777 --> 00:40:52,530
<i>Oh, Mama, welcome to the '60s</i>

814
00:40:52,613 --> 00:40:55,616
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

815
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,827
<i>Go, Mama, go, go, go</i>

816
00:40:58,953 --> 00:41:00,496
They're so glamorous.

817
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,622
Wow.

818
00:41:03,833 --> 00:41:05,084
- It kicked!
- Swell.

819
00:41:05,626 --> 00:41:07,712
Let's toast to that. To your boy!

820
00:41:07,795 --> 00:41:09,297
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

821
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,799
<i>Welcome to the rhythm
Of a brand-new day</i>

822
00:41:11,883 --> 00:41:13,509
<i>Take your old-fashioned fears</i>

823
00:41:13,593 --> 00:41:15,386
<i>And just throw them away</i>

824
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:17,889
<i>You should add some colour
And a fresh new 'do</i>

825
00:41:17,972 --> 00:41:21,684
<i>'Cause it's time for a star
Who looks just like you</i>

826
00:41:33,655 --> 00:41:35,031
I thought we marked these down.

827
00:41:35,573 --> 00:41:36,616
What?

828
00:41:42,414 --> 00:41:43,665
Thank you, Nadine.

829
00:41:47,669 --> 00:41:49,546
There's my shining star!

830
00:41:49,629 --> 00:41:51,214
Fantastic to meet you!

831
00:41:51,298 --> 00:41:52,799
I'm Mr Pinky.

832
00:41:52,883 --> 00:41:54,050
It's so nice to meet you.

833
00:41:55,343 --> 00:41:58,764
Tracy, is this your older sister?

834
00:41:59,431 --> 00:42:00,474
Oh, my.

835
00:42:01,016 --> 00:42:03,727
Perhaps she'd like
some complimentary couture.

836
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:05,145
Couture?

837
00:42:05,229 --> 00:42:07,356
Now, if you'll just sign here.

838
00:42:08,148 --> 00:42:11,276
Flattery will not distract
Miss Turnblad's agent

839
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,278
from reading the fine print.

840
00:42:13,737 --> 00:42:14,988
Her agent?

841
00:42:15,489 --> 00:42:17,074
Tracy, eat your donuts.

842
00:42:17,825 --> 00:42:18,867
Let's talk.

843
00:42:19,702 --> 00:42:21,161
All right, let's see here.

844
00:42:22,538 --> 00:42:23,872
All right. Now...

845
00:42:27,126 --> 00:42:28,168
No!

846
00:42:28,669 --> 00:42:30,921
I want a non-exclusive contract.

847
00:42:31,505 --> 00:42:33,549
Extensions by mutual option.

848
00:42:33,632 --> 00:42:35,885
And I want you to absorb
my 15 percent commission.

849
00:42:35,968 --> 00:42:37,344
Not a dime over ten!

850
00:42:38,387 --> 00:42:39,764
Throw in a bustier?

851
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:44,935
Fifty-four double D?

852
00:42:46,062 --> 00:42:47,355
Triple E.

853
00:42:47,772 --> 00:42:49,315
I hit the mother lode!

854
00:42:49,398 --> 00:42:50,483
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

855
00:42:50,566 --> 00:42:52,276
Care for a Baby Ruth?
I got one right here.

856
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:55,279
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

857
00:42:55,363 --> 00:42:58,282
<i>Oh, Mama, welcome to the '60s</i>

858
00:42:58,366 --> 00:43:01,369
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

859
00:43:01,452 --> 00:43:04,038
<i>Go, Mama, go, go, go</i>

860
00:43:05,998 --> 00:43:08,543
<i>Don't-cha let nobody try
To steal your fun</i>

861
00:43:08,626 --> 00:43:11,963
<i>'Cause a little touch of lipstick
Never hurt no one</i>

862
00:43:12,046 --> 00:43:14,632
<i>The future's got a million roads
For you to choose</i>

863
00:43:14,716 --> 00:43:17,927
<i>But you'll walk a little taller
In some high-heeled shoes</i>

864
00:43:18,011 --> 00:43:20,722
<i>And once you find the style
That makes you feel like you</i>

865
00:43:20,805 --> 00:43:22,182
<i>Something fresh, something new</i>

866
00:43:22,265 --> 00:43:23,683
<i>Step on out, hear us shout</i>

867
00:43:23,766 --> 00:43:25,643
<i>Mama, that's your cue</i>

868
00:43:29,689 --> 00:43:31,483
<i>Ba da ba da ba da</i>

869
00:43:36,738 --> 00:43:37,989
<i>Step on out, hear us shout</i>

870
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:39,991
<i>Mama, that's your cue</i>

871
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:42,827
<i>Hey, Tracy, hey, baby, look at me</i>

872
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:45,872
<i>I'm the cutest chickie
That you ever did see</i>

873
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:48,875
<i>Hey, Tracy, hey, baby, look at us</i>

874
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,711
<i>Where is there a team
That's half as fabulous</i>

875
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:54,631
<i>I let go, go, go of the past now</i>

876
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:57,676
<i>Said hello to this red-carpet ride</i>

877
00:43:57,759 --> 00:44:00,762
<i>Yes, I know
That the world's spinning fast now</i>

878
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:02,973
<i>Tell Lollobrigida to step aside</i>

879
00:44:03,056 --> 00:44:05,601
<i>Your Mama's welcoming the '60s</i>

880
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:08,729
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

881
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:11,565
<i>Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-baby</i>

882
00:44:11,648 --> 00:44:14,693
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

883
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:16,904
<i>Go, Mama, go, go, go</i>

884
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:22,159
<i>Welcome to the '60s</i>

885
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:24,828
<i>Open the door to the girl
Who has more</i>

886
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:27,915
<i>She's a star, Tracy, go, go, go</i>

887
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,254
<i>Hey, Mama, welcome to the '60s</i>

888
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:35,506
<i>- Your mama's hip, your mama's in
- Hey, Mama</i>

889
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:38,259
<i>Your mama's looking at herself
And wondering, "Where you been?"</i>

890
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:39,385
<i>Where you been?</i>

891
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:40,511
<i>- Your mama's lit
- Lit</i>

892
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:41,637
<i>- She's all aglow
- Go, Mama</i>

893
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,097
<i>Your mama once was holding back</i>

894
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,641
<i>But Mama's gotta let go, go, go</i>

895
00:44:45,725 --> 00:44:47,727
<i>Welcome to the "six," to the "O"</i>

896
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,520
<i>To the apostrophe "S"</i>

897
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:52,440
<i>Hey-yay, baby, yeah</i>

898
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:55,651
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

899
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:01,657
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

900
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:03,785
<i>Go, Mama, go, go, go</i>

901
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:07,580
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

902
00:45:07,664 --> 00:45:10,541
<i>Go, Mama, go, go, go</i>

903
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:17,090
Wait until Dad sees you.

904
00:45:17,674 --> 00:45:18,758
Sees me?

905
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:21,010
He never notices what I wear.

906
00:45:21,678 --> 00:45:23,513
In 20 years,
he's never even said to me,

907
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:24,973
"Nice muumuu" or nothing.

908
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:26,099
Now he will.

909
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:30,061
Well, maybe if he leaves that shop
for five minutes.

910
00:45:30,145 --> 00:45:32,731
I swear,
I don't know what goes on down there.

911
00:45:32,814 --> 00:45:33,857
Well.

912
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:36,109
Mrs Turnblad.

913
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,779
I'd know
whose mother you were anywhere.

914
00:45:39,863 --> 00:45:40,906
Really?

915
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:42,574
Hello, Amber.

916
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:43,742
Hello, Tracy.

917
00:45:44,576 --> 00:45:47,788
Ma, this is Amber and Mrs Von Tussle.

918
00:45:47,871 --> 00:45:50,373
Mrs Von Tussle
is the station's manager.

919
00:45:50,457 --> 00:45:52,709
Oh, the station manager.

920
00:45:53,877 --> 00:45:56,296
Oh, it was so nice of you
let her on that show.

921
00:45:56,380 --> 00:46:00,384
Well, Tracy certainly has...
redefined our standards.

922
00:46:00,467 --> 00:46:01,718
That's for sure.

923
00:46:02,177 --> 00:46:03,428
Let me guess...

924
00:46:04,304 --> 00:46:05,472
brand-new dress?

925
00:46:05,556 --> 00:46:06,932
Oh, yes.

926
00:46:07,015 --> 00:46:08,725
Well, you'll stop traffic.

927
00:46:11,186 --> 00:46:13,105
It was nice meeting you. Tracy.

928
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:17,901
Bye, Tracy.

929
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:23,490
Ma, don't listen to a word she says!

930
00:46:23,574 --> 00:46:24,909
I'm taking this back.

931
00:46:24,992 --> 00:46:26,410
- Don't you dare.
- I am.

932
00:46:26,493 --> 00:46:27,912
Don't you dare!

933
00:46:27,995 --> 00:46:29,496
Don't you know why she hates us?

934
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:32,917
She's afraid I'll beat Amber
for Miss Teenage Hairspray.

935
00:46:34,168 --> 00:46:35,211
Really?

936
00:46:35,294 --> 00:46:37,713
They can't put Tracy in special ed.

937
00:46:37,797 --> 00:46:38,923
I won't have it.

938
00:46:39,006 --> 00:46:41,300
I mean,
even if I have to tutor her myself,

939
00:46:41,384 --> 00:46:43,219
they cannot hold my friend back.

940
00:46:43,302 --> 00:46:45,221
You're a saint.

941
00:46:45,304 --> 00:46:46,347
Oh, and it's totally not true

942
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:48,224
about her
and the entire football team.

943
00:46:48,307 --> 00:46:49,600
I mean, please.

944
00:46:49,684 --> 00:46:52,562
Anybody can get grass stains
all over their back.

945
00:46:53,479 --> 00:46:54,647
Amber, stop it.

946
00:46:55,189 --> 00:46:56,524
I'm sick of you doing that.

947
00:46:56,607 --> 00:46:58,484
Just because she's a good dancer.

948
00:46:59,485 --> 00:47:02,029
I'm sorry,
you think that she can dance?

949
00:47:02,113 --> 00:47:04,323
Well, maybe you'd rather have her
as your partner.

950
00:47:04,407 --> 00:47:06,200
You could get sponsored by Goodyear.

951
00:47:06,284 --> 00:47:07,327
Excuse me.

952
00:47:07,869 --> 00:47:09,704
What is going on back there?

953
00:47:12,206 --> 00:47:16,669
Tracy, that's horrible.
Mr Flak does not have breasts.

954
00:47:16,753 --> 00:47:18,338
What? No!

955
00:47:18,421 --> 00:47:19,839
I would... I would never.

956
00:47:34,562 --> 00:47:36,022
Oh, and Mr Larkin,

957
00:47:36,106 --> 00:47:38,400
perhaps you'd like to share
with the rest of the class

958
00:47:38,483 --> 00:47:40,861
Patrick Henry's immortal last words.

959
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,530
"Kiss my ass"?

960
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:55,083
You didn't have to do that, Link.

961
00:47:55,167 --> 00:47:56,460
Hey, no prob.

962
00:47:56,543 --> 00:47:59,296
Besides, it looks like
a cool scene down here.

963
00:47:59,838 --> 00:48:01,006
Right.

964
00:48:01,089 --> 00:48:02,466
Hey, cool.

965
00:48:04,343 --> 00:48:05,802
Hey, Tracy!

966
00:48:11,308 --> 00:48:12,351
Not quite, huh?

967
00:48:13,018 --> 00:48:15,229
Aw, damn. Just when I was getting it.

968
00:48:16,355 --> 00:48:17,773
Listen, man,
you ain't gotta stop now.

969
00:48:17,856 --> 00:48:19,900
My mom's having
a platter party tonight.

970
00:48:19,984 --> 00:48:22,278
- Y'all wanna come check it out?
- Now?

971
00:48:22,361 --> 00:48:25,114
Would you mind if I, too,
checked it out?

972
00:48:25,197 --> 00:48:26,782
I've never been
to North Avenue before.

973
00:48:26,866 --> 00:48:28,784
Uh, well, would it be safe?

974
00:48:28,868 --> 00:48:30,244
You know, for us?

975
00:48:30,327 --> 00:48:32,455
Calm down, cracker boy!

976
00:48:32,538 --> 00:48:33,664
It's cool.

977
00:48:33,747 --> 00:48:36,333
Wow, being invited places
by coloured people!

978
00:48:36,417 --> 00:48:38,377
It feels so hip!

979
00:48:38,461 --> 00:48:41,881
I'm glad y'all feel that way
'cause, uh, not many people do.

980
00:48:42,506 --> 00:48:44,717
- Y'all know what I'm saying?
- Yeah, that's right.

981
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,136
<i>Hey!</i>

982
00:48:47,219 --> 00:48:49,764
<i>I can't see why people look at me</i>

983
00:48:49,847 --> 00:48:53,643
<i>And only see the colour of my face
Ah, yeah</i>

984
00:48:53,726 --> 00:48:56,312
<i>Then there's those that try to help
God knows</i>

985
00:48:56,395 --> 00:48:59,857
<i>But always have to put me in my place</i>

986
00:48:59,941 --> 00:49:02,694
<i>But I won't ask you
To be colour-blind</i>

987
00:49:02,777 --> 00:49:06,322
<i>'Cause if you pick the fruit
Then, girl, you're sure to find</i>

988
00:49:06,406 --> 00:49:09,325
<i>The blacker the berry
The sweeter the juice</i>

989
00:49:09,409 --> 00:49:12,620
<i>I could say it ain't so
But, darling, what's the use?</i>

990
00:49:12,704 --> 00:49:15,957
<i>The darker the chocolate,
the richer the taste</i>

991
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:17,750
<i>And that's where it's at</i>

992
00:49:17,834 --> 00:49:20,044
<i>Now, baby, run and tell that</i>

993
00:49:20,128 --> 00:49:21,755
<i>- Now run and tell that
- Aw, sugar</i>

994
00:49:21,838 --> 00:49:24,591
<i>- Run and tell that
- Run and tell that</i>

995
00:49:24,674 --> 00:49:25,717
<i>Hey, yeah!</i>

996
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,428
<i>I can't see why people disagree</i>

997
00:49:28,511 --> 00:49:31,931
<i>Each time I tell them
What I know is true, oh, no</i>

998
00:49:32,015 --> 00:49:34,768
<i>- And if you come
- And see the world I'm from</i>

999
00:49:34,851 --> 00:49:38,396
<i>I bet your heart
Is gonna feel it, too, yeah</i>

1000
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,525
<i>I could lie but, baby, let's be bold</i>

1001
00:49:41,608 --> 00:49:42,734
<i>Vanilla can be nice</i>

1002
00:49:42,818 --> 00:49:44,986
<i>But if the truth be told</i>

1003
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:47,614
<i>Blacker the berry,
the sweeter the juice</i>

1004
00:49:47,697 --> 00:49:50,951
<i>I could say it ain't so
But, darling, what's the use?</i>

1005
00:49:51,034 --> 00:49:54,329
<i>The darker the chocolate,
the richer the taste</i>

1006
00:49:54,413 --> 00:49:55,497
<i>And that's where it's at</i>

1007
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:58,542
<i>Oh, baby, baby, run and tell that</i>

1008
00:49:58,625 --> 00:50:00,002
<i>- Run and tell that
- Aw, sugar</i>

1009
00:50:00,085 --> 00:50:01,712
<i>Go run and tell that</i>

1010
00:50:01,795 --> 00:50:04,840
<i>- Run and tell that
- Go on and run and tell that</i>

1011
00:50:04,923 --> 00:50:07,509
<i>- Run and tell that
- Hey, run and tell</i>

1012
00:50:07,593 --> 00:50:08,761
<i>Go tell</i>

1013
00:50:08,844 --> 00:50:11,263
<i>Keep moving, people
Run and tell that</i>

1014
00:50:13,849 --> 00:50:14,892
Link!

1015
00:50:14,975 --> 00:50:16,018
Link Larkin!

1016
00:50:18,437 --> 00:50:19,689
<i>Hey, yeah!</i>

1017
00:50:20,815 --> 00:50:24,277
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

1018
00:50:24,694 --> 00:50:26,529
<i>Hey! Whoo!</i>

1019
00:50:27,989 --> 00:50:29,699
<i>Whoo!</i>

1020
00:50:30,742 --> 00:50:33,453
Come here, girl.
This is my sister, Little Inez.

1021
00:50:33,537 --> 00:50:35,080
Oh, I know Tracy Turnblad.

1022
00:50:35,164 --> 00:50:36,707
Good for you, girl!
You got on the show.

1023
00:50:36,790 --> 00:50:38,459
- Well, you better be next.
- You got that right.

1024
00:50:38,542 --> 00:50:40,503
Oh, you know she is.
You better show them, girl.

1025
00:50:40,586 --> 00:50:42,296
Go, girl!

1026
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:45,550
<i>I'm tired of covering up all my pride</i>

1027
00:50:45,633 --> 00:50:48,344
<i>So give me five
On the black hand side</i>

1028
00:50:48,428 --> 00:50:51,890
<i>I got a new way of moving
And I got my own voice</i>

1029
00:50:51,973 --> 00:50:54,726
<i>So how can I help
But to shout and rejoice</i>

1030
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:58,480
<i>Oh, the people 'round here
Can barely pay their rent</i>

1031
00:50:58,564 --> 00:51:01,609
<i>They try to make a dollar
Outta fifteen cent</i>

1032
00:51:01,692 --> 00:51:04,779
<i>But we got a spirit
Money just can't buy</i>

1033
00:51:04,862 --> 00:51:07,573
<i>It's deep as a river
And soars to the sky</i>

1034
00:51:07,657 --> 00:51:09,826
<i>- To the sky!
- Hey!</i>

1035
00:51:09,909 --> 00:51:12,412
<i>I can't see the reason it can't be</i>

1036
00:51:12,495 --> 00:51:15,123
<i>The kinda world
Where we all get our chance</i>

1037
00:51:15,207 --> 00:51:17,167
<i>- Oh, yeah
- The time is now</i>

1038
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:18,836
<i>So we can show them how</i>

1039
00:51:18,919 --> 00:51:22,381
<i>Just turn the music up
And let's all dance, yeah, yeah</i>

1040
00:51:22,464 --> 00:51:25,676
<i>'Cause all things are equal
When it comes to love</i>

1041
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,805
<i>Well, that ain't quite true
'Cause when push comes to shove</i>

1042
00:51:28,888 --> 00:51:31,724
<i>The blacker the berry
The sweeter the juice</i>

1043
00:51:31,808 --> 00:51:35,228
<i>They say it ain't so
But, darling, what's the use?</i>

1044
00:51:35,312 --> 00:51:38,440
<i>The darker the chocolate
The richer the taste</i>

1045
00:51:38,523 --> 00:51:39,691
<i>And that's where it's at</i>

1046
00:51:39,775 --> 00:51:44,196
<i>Now, baby, baby, baby
Run and tell that</i>

1047
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,865
<i>Run and tell that</i>

1048
00:51:45,948 --> 00:51:47,241
<i>- Run and tell that
- Oh, baby</i>

1049
00:51:47,324 --> 00:51:48,909
<i>Go run and tell that</i>

1050
00:51:48,993 --> 00:51:55,208
<i>Go home and run and tell that</i>

1051
00:51:55,291 --> 00:52:02,257
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

1052
00:52:02,341 --> 00:52:09,890
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

1053
00:52:09,974 --> 00:52:11,017
<i>Whoo!</i>

1054
00:52:11,601 --> 00:52:13,436
- Go, baby!
- Yeah!

1055
00:52:16,064 --> 00:52:17,440
It was horrible.

1056
00:52:18,024 --> 00:52:19,609
Mom, he just danced on that bus

1057
00:52:19,693 --> 00:52:21,695
with that great white whale
and those negroes.

1058
00:52:21,778 --> 00:52:22,821
No, honey.

1059
00:52:22,904 --> 00:52:25,782
Reeling him back in
is the easiest thing in the world.

1060
00:52:25,866 --> 00:52:28,243
Remember, I control his career.

1061
00:52:31,705 --> 00:52:35,042
<i>Now, don't worry.
Mommy will take care of everything.</i>

1062
00:52:59,736 --> 00:53:02,614
Are you all hungry for some good fun?

1063
00:53:04,324 --> 00:53:05,367
<i>Yeah</i>

1064
00:53:06,368 --> 00:53:09,913
<i>Bring on that pecan pie</i>

1065
00:53:09,997 --> 00:53:14,752
<i>Pour some sugar on it
Sugar, don't be shy</i>

1066
00:53:14,835 --> 00:53:19,757
<i>Scoop me up a mess
Of that chocolate swirl</i>

1067
00:53:19,841 --> 00:53:23,761
<i>Don't be stingy, I'm a growing girl</i>

1068
00:53:23,845 --> 00:53:29,059
<i>I offer big love with no apology</i>

1069
00:53:29,142 --> 00:53:33,689
<i>How can I deny the world
The most of me?</i>

1070
00:53:33,772 --> 00:53:38,486
<i>I am not afraid
To throw my weight around</i>

1071
00:53:38,569 --> 00:53:41,989
<i>Pound by pound by pound</i>

1072
00:53:42,573 --> 00:53:47,871
<i>Because I'm big, blonde
And beautiful</i>

1073
00:53:47,954 --> 00:53:52,542
<i>Face the fact
It's simply irrefutable</i>

1074
00:53:52,626 --> 00:53:56,755
<i>No one wants a meal
That only offers the least</i>

1075
00:53:56,839 --> 00:54:00,634
<i>When, girl, we're serving up
The whole damn feast</i>

1076
00:54:02,887 --> 00:54:06,683
Well, looks like y'all
took a step outta bounds.

1077
00:54:06,766 --> 00:54:07,809
Now who we got here?

1078
00:54:07,892 --> 00:54:09,686
Mom, I want you to meet
my new friends.

1079
00:54:09,769 --> 00:54:12,230
This here is Link. Tracy Turnblad.

1080
00:54:12,314 --> 00:54:15,442
This is just so Afro-tastic!

1081
00:54:15,817 --> 00:54:17,361
And this young lady right here...

1082
00:54:18,153 --> 00:54:19,279
is Penny Pingleton.

1083
00:54:21,407 --> 00:54:23,242
I'm very pleased
and scared to be here.

1084
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:24,910
Oh, now, honey.

1085
00:54:24,994 --> 00:54:27,663
We got more reason to be scared
on your street.

1086
00:54:28,456 --> 00:54:30,792
Latoya, put that record down.
You gonna scratch it.

1087
00:54:30,875 --> 00:54:31,918
Can't you keep your little girl...

1088
00:54:32,001 --> 00:54:34,170
Shall we dance? Come on.

1089
00:54:35,589 --> 00:54:37,466
My name is Mike.

1090
00:54:37,549 --> 00:54:38,759
<i>Mike?</i>

1091
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:39,885
Yes, Mike.

1092
00:54:39,968 --> 00:54:42,221
<i>- Mike who?</i>
- It's Mike!

1093
00:54:42,304 --> 00:54:43,472
Anyway...

1094
00:54:44,098 --> 00:54:46,183
I'm calling
because I have some information

1095
00:54:46,267 --> 00:54:47,852
about your daughter's whereabouts.

1096
00:54:47,935 --> 00:54:49,645
<i>- What?</i>
- Right now, as we speak,

1097
00:54:49,729 --> 00:54:52,649
your daughter has entered
a hotbed of moral...

1098
00:54:53,691 --> 00:54:55,110
turpentine.

1099
00:54:55,694 --> 00:54:57,946
<i>Baby don't sleep</i>

1100
00:54:58,029 --> 00:54:59,948
<i>Baby don't eat</i>

1101
00:55:00,365 --> 00:55:04,912
<i>Baby just like another boink-boink</i>

1102
00:55:04,995 --> 00:55:07,832
Link, aren't you gonna get
in awful trouble for this?

1103
00:55:07,915 --> 00:55:09,625
I'm not planning on telling my dad.

1104
00:55:09,709 --> 00:55:12,086
No, I mean in trouble
with someone else.

1105
00:55:13,463 --> 00:55:14,505
Maybe.

1106
00:55:15,131 --> 00:55:16,174
Maybe it's worth it.

1107
00:55:17,008 --> 00:55:19,219
I think knowing you's the start
of a pretty big adventure.

1108
00:55:23,432 --> 00:55:25,517
Tracy Edna Turnblad!

1109
00:55:27,061 --> 00:55:28,896
Oh, we get any more
white people in here.

1110
00:55:28,979 --> 00:55:30,439
This gonna be a suburb.

1111
00:55:32,984 --> 00:55:36,362
Do you know what I had to pay a cab
just to consider coming down here?

1112
00:55:36,446 --> 00:55:37,822
Oh, uh, Mom...

1113
00:55:37,906 --> 00:55:40,116
No call! You just disappear.

1114
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,536
And all mashed up against a crooner?

1115
00:55:42,619 --> 00:55:45,247
Um, Edna Turnblad, this is Link.

1116
00:55:47,499 --> 00:55:48,751
Come on, we're going.

1117
00:55:48,834 --> 00:55:51,212
And, Penny, go home
before your mother shoots you.

1118
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:52,421
Miss Edna, is it?

1119
00:55:52,505 --> 00:55:54,799
Hi, I mean,
you don't have to rush off, you know.

1120
00:55:54,882 --> 00:55:57,093
Well, I do. I left my iron on.

1121
00:55:57,176 --> 00:55:58,261
Oh, your iron.

1122
00:55:59,137 --> 00:56:00,471
Well, before you go,

1123
00:56:00,597 --> 00:56:04,768
you sure you wouldn't like to have
a little something to eat?

1124
00:56:14,904 --> 00:56:16,405
Is that braised?

1125
00:56:16,489 --> 00:56:18,574
<i>Whoa, oh, oh</i>

1126
00:56:18,658 --> 00:56:20,368
<i>Whoa, oh, oh</i>

1127
00:56:20,451 --> 00:56:25,165
<i>Slice me off a piece
Of that hogshead cheese</i>

1128
00:56:25,248 --> 00:56:29,795
<i>And take a look inside
My book of recipes</i>

1129
00:56:29,878 --> 00:56:34,591
<i>Now, don't you sniff around
For something fluffy and light</i>

1130
00:56:34,675 --> 00:56:38,804
<i>We need a man
Who brings a man-size appetite</i>

1131
00:56:38,888 --> 00:56:44,060
<i>We'll use a pinch of sugar
And a dash of spice</i>

1132
00:56:44,143 --> 00:56:48,815
<i>I'll let you lick the spoon
Because it tastes so nice</i>

1133
00:56:48,899 --> 00:56:52,945
<i>We keep it in the oven
Till it's good and hot</i>

1134
00:56:53,028 --> 00:56:57,491
<i>Keep on stirring
Till it hits the spot</i>

1135
00:56:57,575 --> 00:57:02,788
<i>Because I'm big, blonde
And beautiful</i>

1136
00:57:02,872 --> 00:57:07,544
<i>There is nothing 'bout us
That's unsuitable</i>

1137
00:57:07,627 --> 00:57:11,673
<i>Why sit in the bleachers
Timid and afraid</i>

1138
00:57:11,756 --> 00:57:16,345
<i>When, Edna,
You look like the whole parade?</i>

1139
00:57:16,428 --> 00:57:19,348
<i>They say that white
Has might and thin is in</i>

1140
00:57:19,431 --> 00:57:21,016
<i>Well, that's just bull</i>

1141
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:22,893
<i>'Cause, ladies, big is back</i>

1142
00:57:22,977 --> 00:57:25,813
<i>And as for black, it's beautiful</i>

1143
00:57:25,897 --> 00:57:28,066
<i>All shapes and sizes follow me</i>

1144
00:57:28,149 --> 00:57:35,407
<i>Who wants a twig
When you can climb a whole tree</i>

1145
00:57:35,490 --> 00:57:37,117
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

1146
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:41,038
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

1147
00:57:43,290 --> 00:57:45,376
Groovy, baby. Groovy!

1148
00:57:54,761 --> 00:57:56,012
Hello?

1149
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,623
Hello?

1150
00:58:31,801 --> 00:58:33,219
Oh, my god!

1151
00:58:34,554 --> 00:58:36,014
Oh, you got me.

1152
00:58:37,182 --> 00:58:40,977
Welcome... to the Hardy-Har Hut.

1153
00:58:41,061 --> 00:58:44,022
If we can't put a smile on your face,
your skin's too tight.

1154
00:58:44,106 --> 00:58:45,858
- Oh!
- Bop, bop.

1155
00:58:45,941 --> 00:58:48,068
- Oh.
- I got something for you. Yeah.

1156
00:58:48,152 --> 00:58:49,361
It's just in.

1157
00:58:49,445 --> 00:58:51,655
You're gonna love it.

1158
00:58:54,325 --> 00:58:55,576
Cigarette?

1159
00:58:58,746 --> 00:59:00,457
Tempting but, uh...

1160
00:59:01,374 --> 00:59:03,084
No, thanks!

1161
00:59:03,168 --> 00:59:05,003
Well, eh, okay.

1162
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:08,924
What can I do you for?

1163
00:59:09,007 --> 00:59:10,092
Something for the mister?

1164
00:59:10,175 --> 00:59:14,263
Sadly, there is no mister
at the moment.

1165
00:59:14,347 --> 00:59:16,098
Beautiful woman like yourself?

1166
00:59:16,807 --> 00:59:18,226
My husband...

1167
00:59:20,854 --> 00:59:22,605
accidentally suffocated.

1168
00:59:24,065 --> 00:59:26,651
- You need a fella.
- I do.

1169
00:59:26,735 --> 00:59:28,111
I do need a fella.

1170
00:59:28,654 --> 00:59:33,576
And the way to a man's heart
is through his funny bone.

1171
00:59:33,659 --> 00:59:35,745
Now here's an icebreaker for you.

1172
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:41,167
Oh, Miss Maybelle,
you do throw a lovely party.

1173
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:42,794
But what are you celebrating?

1174
00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:45,630
Well, it's kind of an ending.

1175
00:59:45,714 --> 00:59:47,924
But it deserved
to go out with a bang.

1176
00:59:48,925 --> 00:59:49,968
What ended?

1177
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,931
- Negro Day.
- What?

1178
00:59:54,014 --> 00:59:56,392
All right. Time y'all knew.

1179
00:59:58,227 --> 01:00:01,439
Velma Von Tussle just told me
we have had our last show.

1180
01:00:01,522 --> 01:00:02,565
- No.
- What?

1181
01:00:02,648 --> 01:00:05,276
Yeah, it seems our little show
was a nice little placeholder,

1182
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:07,237
but it was time to get some ratings.

1183
01:00:07,654 --> 01:00:09,573
I didn't wanna tell y'all up front.

1184
01:00:10,365 --> 01:00:12,659
I just wanted
to have a little fun tonight.

1185
01:00:12,743 --> 01:00:14,953
But I practiced so hard.

1186
01:00:15,037 --> 01:00:17,247
Now I'll never get a chance
to be on the show.

1187
01:00:17,331 --> 01:00:20,376
Oh, you will be seen, baby.
I promise.

1188
01:00:20,459 --> 01:00:23,421
You can't have your own show?
Fine, you'll come dance with us.

1189
01:00:24,714 --> 01:00:27,342
Honey, you been dozing off
during history?

1190
01:00:27,425 --> 01:00:29,219
Yes, always.

1191
01:00:29,302 --> 01:00:32,222
Trace, black and whites
ain't never danced on TV together.

1192
01:00:32,305 --> 01:00:34,599
Well, if we can't dance...

1193
01:00:35,434 --> 01:00:38,020
maybe we should just march.

1194
01:00:40,189 --> 01:00:42,316
Ooh, that'd get some big ol' ratings.

1195
01:00:42,399 --> 01:00:44,110
Better time slot, too.

1196
01:00:44,652 --> 01:00:46,904
Like on the 11:00 news.

1197
01:00:48,072 --> 01:00:49,198
What y'all say?

1198
01:00:49,282 --> 01:00:52,243
Should we give this fine woman
all the ratings she deserves?

1199
01:00:52,327 --> 01:00:54,037
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1200
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:55,288
Hey, hey!

1201
01:00:55,372 --> 01:00:57,582
Well, it is a school night...

1202
01:00:57,666 --> 01:00:59,084
and I think
we ought to call it a night.

1203
01:00:59,167 --> 01:01:00,544
Tell you what.
We meet up at the church

1204
01:01:00,627 --> 01:01:05,341
Friday, 4:00,
and we will march on WYZT.

1205
01:01:05,424 --> 01:01:07,510
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1206
01:01:07,593 --> 01:01:08,636
Yeah!

1207
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:10,847
Tracy, you can't protest, hon.

1208
01:01:10,930 --> 01:01:12,265
I mean, these are lovely people,

1209
01:01:12,390 --> 01:01:14,642
but if you protest,
you'll be on lists.

1210
01:01:14,726 --> 01:01:16,061
You'll be on files.

1211
01:01:16,144 --> 01:01:17,979
J. Edgar Hoover'll
be still wiretapping

1212
01:01:18,063 --> 01:01:19,982
your cold, dead body in the grave.

1213
01:01:20,065 --> 01:01:21,108
Oh, Mother.

1214
01:01:21,191 --> 01:01:23,277
Link, we're going with them, right?

1215
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:25,362
Walk with me.

1216
01:01:26,489 --> 01:01:30,201
You want your Belgian chocolate
animal droppings.

1217
01:01:32,286 --> 01:01:34,664
Dot, dot. This store's for you.

1218
01:01:36,916 --> 01:01:38,710
- Oh! What a treasure trove.
- Huh?

1219
01:01:38,793 --> 01:01:40,170
Come here, baby.

1220
01:01:41,797 --> 01:01:42,839
Don't be sad.

1221
01:01:43,549 --> 01:01:45,092
We gonna make it happen, okay?

1222
01:01:45,175 --> 01:01:47,094
- Can I go?
- Now, come on, now.

1223
01:01:47,177 --> 01:01:48,929
I can't be worried about you
out there.

1224
01:01:50,473 --> 01:01:51,515
Trace...

1225
01:01:52,475 --> 01:01:55,186
I been smiling and dancing
on this show for 3 years.

1226
01:01:56,396 --> 01:01:57,856
Mrs Von Tussle just promised
I could sing

1227
01:01:57,939 --> 01:01:59,190
at the Miss Hairspray pageant.

1228
01:01:59,274 --> 01:02:01,234
She's... she invited agents.

1229
01:02:02,569 --> 01:02:03,987
That's my shot, Trace.

1230
01:02:04,821 --> 01:02:06,114
I can't jeopardize that.

1231
01:02:06,865 --> 01:02:08,242
But it's what's right.

1232
01:02:09,201 --> 01:02:10,452
I'm sorry, Trace.

1233
01:02:11,454 --> 01:02:12,913
I just think this adventure's...

1234
01:02:13,497 --> 01:02:14,749
a little...

1235
01:02:14,832 --> 01:02:15,875
too big for me.

1236
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:19,963
Oh, God. No, no, no.
That's not what I...

1237
01:02:20,046 --> 01:02:22,340
I get it, Link. It's your shot.

1238
01:02:22,424 --> 01:02:23,508
No, Trace, that's not what I...

1239
01:02:23,592 --> 01:02:24,718
It's fine.

1240
01:02:27,846 --> 01:02:29,306
Oh, hon.

1241
01:02:33,102 --> 01:02:34,145
I should go.

1242
01:02:35,396 --> 01:02:36,439
Give him time.

1243
01:02:36,522 --> 01:02:38,524
He'll figure out
he's crazy 'bout you.

1244
01:02:38,608 --> 01:02:41,569
You have to say that.
You're my mother.

1245
01:02:42,153 --> 01:02:45,198
Well, I know
a little something about men.

1246
01:02:45,282 --> 01:02:49,745
And, my personal favourite,
X-ray specs.

1247
01:02:49,828 --> 01:02:51,163
You can see through anything.

1248
01:02:51,246 --> 01:02:53,165
Skin, clothes, you name it.

1249
01:02:54,833 --> 01:02:55,918
Now, take your father.

1250
01:02:56,001 --> 01:02:59,046
And he's always downstairs
in that shop working late.

1251
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:01,549
Do I take it personal? No.

1252
01:03:01,632 --> 01:03:04,093
Men always put their career first.

1253
01:03:04,177 --> 01:03:06,137
- Remember that.
- Okay.

1254
01:03:06,763 --> 01:03:08,557
I'm really tired.
I'm gonna go to bed.

1255
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,434
All right, hon. Night.

1256
01:03:10,517 --> 01:03:12,436
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

1257
01:03:13,187 --> 01:03:15,314
I think I'm gonna go to bed, too.

1258
01:03:15,397 --> 01:03:16,982
Oh, I'm so tired.

1259
01:03:22,822 --> 01:03:24,615
You don't need those...

1260
01:03:26,534 --> 01:03:28,703
to see what's under these clothes.

1261
01:03:29,913 --> 01:03:31,540
There's a product that really works

1262
01:03:31,623 --> 01:03:34,459
'cause these are phony
as a three-dollar bill.

1263
01:03:38,839 --> 01:03:40,508
Incredible!

1264
01:03:40,591 --> 01:03:42,259
I could do a fan dance
with a lettuce leaf

1265
01:03:42,343 --> 01:03:45,555
and you would remain
completely obtuse!

1266
01:03:45,638 --> 01:03:46,681
Obtuse.

1267
01:03:46,764 --> 01:03:48,516
Yes, obtuse!

1268
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:49,893
I flunked geometry.

1269
01:03:49,976 --> 01:03:52,729
Yeah, well...
And biology too, no doubt!

1270
01:03:52,812 --> 01:03:53,855
Yeah.

1271
01:03:55,774 --> 01:03:57,276
Wait! How about this?

1272
01:03:57,359 --> 01:03:59,278
Okay.

1273
01:04:01,906 --> 01:04:04,116
<i>Those lips, those eyes</i>

1274
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,242
<i>That food</i>

1275
01:04:05,326 --> 01:04:07,537
<i>Well, there ain't nothing
Like a spread</i>

1276
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:09,789
<i>To get you in the mood</i>

1277
01:04:09,872 --> 01:04:14,377
<i>Wilbur, can't you feel
The burning flame of hot desire</i>

1278
01:04:14,461 --> 01:04:16,880
<i>You're gonna need
More than some seltzer</i>

1279
01:04:16,963 --> 01:04:19,007
<i>To put out this fire</i>

1280
01:04:19,091 --> 01:04:22,845
<i>I'm wailing, "Look out, old Balti...</i>

1281
01:04:22,928 --> 01:04:26,307
<i>"...More!" I'm selling something
You can't purchase</i>

1282
01:04:26,390 --> 01:04:28,100
<i>At a ten-cent store</i>

1283
01:04:28,184 --> 01:04:30,603
<i>Oh, Wilbur, I feel like a princess</i>

1284
01:04:30,686 --> 01:04:32,605
<i>Come on and take me to the ball</i>

1285
01:04:32,689 --> 01:04:35,316
<i>I bet you're tired of heavy lifting</i>

1286
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,360
<i>Get your hands on something small</i>

1287
01:04:38,570 --> 01:04:40,197
<i>Because I'm a-big...</i>

1288
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:41,406
<i>...blonde...</i>

1289
01:04:41,490 --> 01:04:43,492
<i>- ...and beautiful
- ...and beautiful</i>

1290
01:04:43,575 --> 01:04:45,494
<i>It's time to face the facts</i>

1291
01:04:45,577 --> 01:04:48,247
<i>It's irrefutable</i>

1292
01:04:48,330 --> 01:04:50,207
<i>Why waste one more minute</i>

1293
01:04:50,291 --> 01:04:52,293
<i>Now I feel brand spanking new</i>

1294
01:04:52,418 --> 01:04:53,961
<i>Hey, Wilbur, take a look</i>

1295
01:04:54,045 --> 01:04:55,296
<i>It's all for</i>

1296
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:56,548
<i>You</i>

1297
01:04:56,631 --> 01:04:57,799
You?

1298
01:04:59,843 --> 01:05:01,720
- Edna.
- Your wife!

1299
01:05:02,137 --> 01:05:04,223
You said she was out! Wait a minute!

1300
01:05:04,306 --> 01:05:05,349
Hi, hon.

1301
01:05:07,559 --> 01:05:09,895
Ma, you don't really believe
that he would do that.

1302
01:05:09,979 --> 01:05:13,232
You are never setting foot
on that show again.

1303
01:05:13,316 --> 01:05:14,776
You hear me?

1304
01:05:14,859 --> 01:05:18,029
I heard you the first 400 times, Ma.

1305
01:05:41,179 --> 01:05:42,347
Hey.

1306
01:05:49,021 --> 01:05:50,272
Daddy!

1307
01:05:50,981 --> 01:05:52,316
It wasn't me.

1308
01:05:53,275 --> 01:05:56,028
I had to improvise
a bed out of something.

1309
01:05:56,112 --> 01:05:57,989
Whoopee cushions?

1310
01:05:58,072 --> 01:06:01,659
That will play heck with my sciatica.

1311
01:06:02,952 --> 01:06:04,037
That one was me.

1312
01:06:06,247 --> 01:06:08,708
Daddy, are you okay?

1313
01:06:10,627 --> 01:06:13,422
Tracy, you know...

1314
01:06:14,298 --> 01:06:17,259
These peepers have never looked
at another woman.

1315
01:06:18,886 --> 01:06:21,806
This heart only beats for size 60.

1316
01:06:22,890 --> 01:06:25,685
Daddy, you know what Velma wanted.

1317
01:06:25,768 --> 01:06:28,063
She wanted me off the show.

1318
01:06:28,146 --> 01:06:32,150
And I knew that,
but how could she go that far?

1319
01:06:32,234 --> 01:06:34,736
Come here. Come here, little girl.

1320
01:06:35,863 --> 01:06:38,115
Little girl.

1321
01:06:38,198 --> 01:06:41,619
And then,
to just cancel Negro Day like that.

1322
01:06:41,702 --> 01:06:44,247
Just to make sure
that nobody who's different,

1323
01:06:44,330 --> 01:06:46,499
or who's black, or Chinese,

1324
01:06:46,583 --> 01:06:48,918
or maybe who needs to lose
a few pounds.

1325
01:06:49,002 --> 01:06:51,421
What are you talking? Stop it.

1326
01:06:51,504 --> 01:06:52,964
What are you talking?

1327
01:06:53,882 --> 01:06:56,301
I think I've been in a bubble
or something.

1328
01:06:56,385 --> 01:06:59,888
Thinking that fairness
was just going to happen.

1329
01:06:59,972 --> 01:07:01,432
It's not.

1330
01:07:01,515 --> 01:07:03,351
I think people like me

1331
01:07:03,434 --> 01:07:06,771
are gonna have to get up
off their father's laps

1332
01:07:06,854 --> 01:07:09,148
and go out there and fight for it.

1333
01:07:17,574 --> 01:07:19,076
Your mother and I,

1334
01:07:19,159 --> 01:07:21,412
we don't see too far past
our front door.

1335
01:07:21,495 --> 01:07:25,166
But you...
see all the way to Schenectady.

1336
01:07:25,249 --> 01:07:29,212
So, if there's something
you need to stand up for,

1337
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:31,756
don't you listen to old dogs like us.

1338
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:34,718
We need to learn some new tricks...

1339
01:07:35,844 --> 01:07:37,053
from you.

1340
01:07:37,971 --> 01:07:40,098
You don't need new tricks, Dad.

1341
01:07:40,182 --> 01:07:42,017
You need Mom.

1342
01:07:47,982 --> 01:07:49,734
She changed the locks.

1343
01:08:02,205 --> 01:08:03,457
Good night, Daddy.

1344
01:08:13,593 --> 01:08:14,635
Aw, love.

1345
01:08:16,054 --> 01:08:17,555
Come on, baby.

1346
01:08:22,394 --> 01:08:25,981
Honey, took me five years
to figure out you were flirting.

1347
01:08:27,024 --> 01:08:28,359
How could I ever?

1348
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:32,446
Well, she is very glamorous.

1349
01:08:33,364 --> 01:08:34,532
Edna.

1350
01:08:38,995 --> 01:08:41,998
She just makes me feel old.

1351
01:08:42,082 --> 01:08:43,375
Nonsense.

1352
01:08:43,875 --> 01:08:45,335
Doll!

1353
01:08:45,419 --> 01:08:47,296
You're spry as a Slinky.

1354
01:08:50,007 --> 01:08:51,467
I'm not talking to you.

1355
01:08:52,134 --> 01:08:56,138
<i>Styles keep a-changing
The world's rearranging</i>

1356
01:08:56,222 --> 01:08:59,016
<i>But, Edna, you're timeless to me</i>

1357
01:09:00,435 --> 01:09:04,397
<i>Hemlines are shorter
A beer costs a quarter</i>

1358
01:09:04,481 --> 01:09:07,359
<i>But time cannot take what comes free</i>

1359
01:09:09,111 --> 01:09:12,030
<i>You're like a stinky old cheese, babe</i>

1360
01:09:12,698 --> 01:09:15,785
<i>Just getting riper with age</i>

1361
01:09:17,286 --> 01:09:20,456
<i>- You're like a fatal disease, babe</i>
- What?

1362
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:24,836
<i>But there's no cure
So let this fever rage</i>

1363
01:09:24,919 --> 01:09:29,007
<i>Some folks can't stand it
Say time is a bandit</i>

1364
01:09:29,090 --> 01:09:32,469
<i>But I take the opposite view</i>

1365
01:09:32,553 --> 01:09:34,722
<i>'Cause when I need a lift</i>

1366
01:09:35,389 --> 01:09:37,183
<i>Time brings a gift</i>

1367
01:09:37,266 --> 01:09:41,270
<i>Another day with you</i>

1368
01:09:41,354 --> 01:09:43,314
<i>A twist or a waltz</i>

1369
01:09:43,398 --> 01:09:44,983
<i>It's all the same schmaltz</i>

1370
01:09:45,066 --> 01:09:48,361
<i>With just a change in the scenery</i>

1371
01:09:49,070 --> 01:09:50,906
<i>You'll never be old hat</i>

1372
01:09:50,989 --> 01:09:52,365
<i>That's that</i>

1373
01:09:52,449 --> 01:09:54,952
<i>You're timeless to me</i>

1374
01:09:57,830 --> 01:09:59,915
<i>Fads keep a-fading</i>

1375
01:09:59,999 --> 01:10:01,751
<i>Castro's invading</i>

1376
01:10:01,834 --> 01:10:05,046
<i>But, Wilbur, you're timeless to me</i>

1377
01:10:06,005 --> 01:10:07,799
<i>Hairdos are higher</i>

1378
01:10:07,882 --> 01:10:09,968
<i>Mine feels like barbed wire</i>

1379
01:10:10,051 --> 01:10:13,180
<i>But you say I'm chic as can be</i>

1380
01:10:14,389 --> 01:10:18,268
<i>- You're like a rare vintage ripple</i>
- Thank you.

1381
01:10:18,352 --> 01:10:21,480
<i>A vintage they'll never forget</i>

1382
01:10:22,398 --> 01:10:26,527
<i>- So pour me a teeny-weeny triple</i>
- Any time!

1383
01:10:26,611 --> 01:10:30,073
<i>And we can toast the fact
We ain't dead yet</i>

1384
01:10:30,156 --> 01:10:32,617
- What?
<i>- I can't stop eating</i>

1385
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:34,744
<i>- Your hairline's receding</i>
- Hey!

1386
01:10:34,828 --> 01:10:37,456
<i>And soon, you'll have nothing at all</i>

1387
01:10:37,581 --> 01:10:38,832
Never.

1388
01:10:38,916 --> 01:10:40,793
<i>So you'll wear a wig</i>

1389
01:10:40,876 --> 01:10:42,419
<i>While I roast a pig</i>

1390
01:10:42,503 --> 01:10:45,506
<i>Hey! Pass that Geritol</i>

1391
01:10:45,589 --> 01:10:46,632
I love pig.

1392
01:10:46,716 --> 01:10:48,593
<i>Glenn Miller had brass</i>

1393
01:10:48,676 --> 01:10:51,012
<i>That Chubby Checker's a gas</i>

1394
01:10:51,095 --> 01:10:53,973
<i>But they all pass eventually</i>

1395
01:10:54,849 --> 01:10:58,061
<i>You'll never be passé, hip-hooray</i>

1396
01:10:58,145 --> 01:11:00,480
<i>You're timeless to me</i>

1397
01:11:52,870 --> 01:11:56,165
<i>You're like a broken-down Chevy</i>

1398
01:11:56,249 --> 01:11:59,586
<i>All I need is a fresh coat of paint</i>

1399
01:12:00,336 --> 01:12:04,633
<i>And, Edna
You got me going hot and heavy</i>

1400
01:12:04,716 --> 01:12:06,468
<i>You're fat and old</i>

1401
01:12:06,551 --> 01:12:08,470
- What?
<i>- But, baby, boring you ain't</i>

1402
01:12:09,304 --> 01:12:11,306
<i>Some folks don't get it</i>

1403
01:12:11,390 --> 01:12:13,225
<i>But we never fret it</i>

1404
01:12:13,309 --> 01:12:16,562
<i>'Cause we know
That time is our friend</i>

1405
01:12:16,646 --> 01:12:19,273
<i>Yeah, it's plain to see</i>

1406
01:12:19,357 --> 01:12:20,984
<i>That you're stuck with me</i>

1407
01:12:21,067 --> 01:12:24,654
<i>Until the bitter end</i>

1408
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:29,159
<i>And we got a kid
Who's blowing the lid</i>

1409
01:12:29,242 --> 01:12:32,746
<i>Off the Turnblad family tree</i>

1410
01:12:33,163 --> 01:12:35,374
<i>You'll always hit the spot</i>

1411
01:12:35,457 --> 01:12:36,792
<i>Big shot</i>

1412
01:12:36,876 --> 01:12:39,045
<i>You're timeless to me</i>

1413

01:12:45,093 --> 01:12:47,220
<i>You're timeless to me</i>

1415
01:12:52,935 --> 01:12:57,273
<i>You'll always be first string</i>

1416
01:12:57,356 --> 01:12:59,650
<i>Ring-a-ding-ding</i>

01:13:06,115 --> 01:13:09,077
<i>You're timeless to me</i>

1419
01:13:10,036 --> 01:13:13,498
<i>You're timeless to me</i>

1420
01:13:15,250 --> 01:13:17,878
<i>- You're timeless

1422
01:13:27,805 --> 01:13:29,140
<i>Oh, Wilbur.</i>

1423
01:13:34,479 --> 01:13:36,064
Tracy.

1424
01:13:36,148 --> 01:13:37,357
Wake up, hon.

1425
01:13:38,233 --> 01:13:40,402
Wake up. Everything's good again.

1426
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:43,948
Wilbur?

1427
01:13:44,448 --> 01:13:45,616
Wilbur!

1428
01:13:47,618 --> 01:13:49,662
Seaweed, help pass those signs out.

1429
01:13:51,122 --> 01:13:52,415
Give her one.

1430
01:13:53,291 --> 01:13:54,376
Hey, Jackie, we're over here.

1431
01:13:55,293 --> 01:13:57,003
Aw, you looking good, Gertrude.

1432
01:13:57,504 --> 01:13:59,047
Come on, y'all. Here we go now.

1433
01:14:01,967 --> 01:14:03,135
Tracy!

1434
01:14:04,887 --> 01:14:07,056
You're gonna pay a heavy price.

1435
01:14:07,139 --> 01:14:08,307
I know.

1436
01:14:08,391 --> 01:14:10,101
You'll never dance on TV again.

1437
01:14:10,184 --> 01:14:12,478
If I can't dance
with Seaweed and Little Inez,

1438
01:14:12,562 --> 01:14:14,522
then I don't wanna dance
on TV at all.

1439
01:14:15,356 --> 01:14:17,609
I just want tomorrow to be better.

1440
01:14:18,443 --> 01:14:21,655
<i>There's a light</i>

1441
01:14:22,531 --> 01:14:26,619
<i>In the darkness</i>

1442
01:14:26,702 --> 01:14:34,168
<i>Though the night is black as my skin</i>

1443
01:14:34,836 --> 01:14:39,382
<i>There's a light burning bright</i>

1444
01:14:39,507 --> 01:14:43,220
<i>Showing me the way</i>

1445
01:14:45,556 --> 01:14:49,435
<i>But I know where I've been</i>

1446
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:55,525
<i>There's a cry</i>

1447
01:14:55,608 --> 01:14:58,987
<i>In the distance</i>

1448
01:14:59,863 --> 01:15:05,744
<i>It's a voice that comes
From deep within</i>

1449
01:15:05,827 --> 01:15:08,038
<i>Hey, yeah</i>

1450
01:15:08,121 --> 01:15:11,834
<i>There's a cry asking why</i>

1451
01:15:12,251 --> 01:15:16,047
<i>I pray the answer's up ahead</i>

1452
01:15:18,716 --> 01:15:23,763
<i>'Cause I know where I've been</i>

1453
01:15:28,769 --> 01:15:35,609
<i>There's a road we been traveling</i>

1454
01:15:36,944 --> 01:15:43,660
<i>Lost so many on the way</i>

1455
01:15:45,370 --> 01:15:52,211
<i>But the riches will be plenty</i>

1456
01:15:53,629 --> 01:15:55,965
<i>Worth the price</i>

1457
01:15:56,048 --> 01:16:01,846
<i>The price we had to pay</i>

1458
01:16:01,929 --> 01:16:06,184
<i>There's a dream</i>

1459
01:16:06,267 --> 01:16:08,561
<i>In the future</i>

1460
01:16:10,313 --> 01:16:12,524
<i>There's a struggle</i>

1461
01:16:12,607 --> 01:16:16,445
<i>That we have yet to win</i>

1462
01:16:18,447 --> 01:16:22,827
<i>And there's pride in my heart</i>

1463
01:16:22,910 --> 01:16:26,914
<i>'Cause I know where I'm going</i>

1464
01:16:26,998 --> 01:16:29,167

1466
01:16:33,922 --> 01:16:34,965

<i>Until tomorrow</i>

1483
01:17:34,571 --> 01:17:39,367
<i>'Cause just to sit still
Would be a sin</i>

1484
01:17:39,451 --> 01:17:44,081
<i>I know it, I know it
I know where I'm going</i>

1485
01:17:44,164 --> 01:17:52,131

01:17:58,596 --> 01:18:02,184
<i>Yeah, I'll give thanks to my God</i>

1488

<i>'Cause I know where I've been, yeah</i>

1489
01:18:12,695 --> 01:18:14,655
Oh, yeah, amen!

1490
01:18:14,739 --> 01:18:16,949
- Amen, amen!
- That's right.

1491
01:18:17,033 --> 01:18:19,911
Tracy, hon,
you don't know what you're doing.

1492
01:18:19,994 --> 01:18:21,162
Yes, I do, Ma.

1493
01:18:21,246 --> 01:18:22,288
Hello, Miss Maybelle.

1494
01:18:22,372 --> 01:18:24,124
Well, good evening, Miss Edna.
Nice of you to join us.

1495
01:18:24,207 --> 01:18:25,542
She's got a lovely turnout.

1496
01:18:25,625 --> 01:18:27,336
Now, I really think
they don't need you anymore.

1497
01:18:27,419 --> 01:18:28,587
You come home with me.

1498
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:33,425
No, we are not sending a camera crew.

1499
01:18:33,509 --> 01:18:37,013
They're protesting
our own station, dimwit.

1500
01:18:38,139 --> 01:18:40,099
Why is Channel Five there?

1501
01:18:41,476 --> 01:18:43,561
Well, of course they're all Negroes.

1502
01:18:43,645 --> 01:18:45,146
And why would...

1503
01:18:48,150 --> 01:18:52,112
I know who would.
I know exactly who would.

1504
01:18:52,196 --> 01:18:53,781
<i>- Two, four, six, eight!
- Two, four, six, eight!</i>

1505
01:18:53,864 --> 01:18:55,866
- TV's got to integrate!
- TV's got to integrate!

1506
01:18:55,950 --> 01:18:59,745
Two, four, six, eight!
TV's got to integrate!

1507
01:18:59,829 --> 01:19:01,789
- Two, four, six, eight!
- Oh, my god, no!

1508
01:19:01,873 --> 01:19:02,915
- TV's got to integrate!
- TV's got to integrate!

1509
01:19:02,999 --> 01:19:04,417
- No!
- Ma, come on.

1510
01:19:04,501 --> 01:19:05,543
The sound's not working.

1511
01:19:05,627 --> 01:19:06,711
You knew there'd be police.

1512
01:19:06,795 --> 01:19:08,338
But I didn't know there'd be cameras.

1513
01:19:08,421 --> 01:19:09,464
So?

1514
01:19:09,548 --> 01:19:12,009
Oh, I cannot be seen on television
at this present weight.

1515
01:19:12,092 --> 01:19:15,554
Two, four, six, eight!
TV's got to integrate!

1516
01:19:15,637 --> 01:19:19,475
Two, four, six, eight!
TV's got to integrate!

1517
01:19:19,558 --> 01:19:22,103
Two, four, six, eight!
TV's got to integrate!

1518
01:19:22,186 --> 01:19:23,438
Excuse me.

1519
01:19:23,521 --> 01:19:25,732
Is there some reason
we can't pass by peacefully?

1520
01:19:25,815 --> 01:19:28,401
I strongly suggest you
and your little friends

1521
01:19:28,485 --> 01:19:30,028
head back to where you come from.

1522
01:19:30,946 --> 01:19:32,280
Hey, you don't have to be so rude.

1523
01:19:32,364 --> 01:19:33,407
Tracy!

1524
01:19:33,490 --> 01:19:35,200
It's all right, Tracy.
I can handle this.

1525
01:19:35,284 --> 01:19:39,038
- Excuse me. She was talking to you.
- Tracy!

1526
01:19:39,121 --> 01:19:40,331
Tracy, no.

1527
01:19:40,998 --> 01:19:43,292
You just assaulted
a police officer, miss.

1528
01:19:43,376 --> 01:19:44,752
- No!
- I what?

1529
01:19:44,836 --> 01:19:45,962
Assaulted?

1530
01:19:46,045 --> 01:19:47,964
Enough! Hey!

1531
01:19:50,592 --> 01:19:51,760
All right, boys.

1532
01:19:52,761 --> 01:19:54,095
Let's take the whole lot in.

1533
01:19:54,179 --> 01:19:55,764
- No!
- Run, Tracy! Run!

1534
01:19:56,682 --> 01:19:59,810
Two, four, six, eight!
TV's got to integrate!

1535
01:19:59,893 --> 01:20:02,855
Two, four, six, eight!
TV's got to integrate!

1536
01:20:02,938 --> 01:20:05,900
Two, four, six, eight!
TV's got to integrate!

1537
01:20:05,983 --> 01:20:09,070
Two, four, six, eight!
TV's got to integrate!

1538
01:20:09,153 --> 01:20:11,698
<i>And our cameras
also caught Tracy Turnblad,</i>

1539
01:20:11,781 --> 01:20:14,784
<i>the teenage TV personality
and rabble-rouser.</i>

1540
01:20:14,868 --> 01:20:17,162
<i>Miss Turnblad brutally attacked
a sergeant</i>

1541
01:20:17,245 --> 01:20:19,498
<i>- with a blunt instrument...</i>
- You see?

1542
01:20:19,581 --> 01:20:20,791
You see?

1543
01:20:20,874 --> 01:20:22,710
If I let you leave the house
right now,

1544
01:20:22,793 --> 01:20:25,588
you'd be in prison
fighting whores for cigarettes.

1545
01:20:25,671 --> 01:20:27,923
That Tracy Turnblad always was
a bad influence.

1546
01:20:28,007 --> 01:20:31,636
Well, you are never, ever gonna see
that beehived harlot again.

1547
01:20:31,719 --> 01:20:33,221
Okay, Mother. Excuse me.

1548
01:20:33,304 --> 01:20:34,347
Penny?

1549
01:20:34,430 --> 01:20:35,473
Pray for her.

1550
01:20:36,182 --> 01:20:37,767
She's gonna need it.

1551
01:20:39,436 --> 01:20:41,939
- Wait! Wait!
- Tracy! Tracy!

1552
01:20:42,022 --> 01:20:43,899
She's not here, I told you.

1553
01:20:45,317 --> 01:20:46,694
Hon, she knows...

1554
01:20:46,777 --> 01:20:50,406
If the cops are looking for her,
this is the first place they'll come.

1555
01:20:53,284 --> 01:20:56,120
What this
must have put you through, Wilbur.

1556
01:20:56,204 --> 01:20:57,539
I'm so sorry.

1557
01:20:57,622 --> 01:20:59,082
- I'm not.
- You're not?

1558
01:20:59,541 --> 01:21:00,584
I'm proud of you.

1559
01:21:00,667 --> 01:21:01,752
You are?

1560
01:21:01,835 --> 01:21:03,837
Baby, somebody had to do something.

1561
01:21:04,755 --> 01:21:08,175
'Course, we may be eating beans
for the next ten years.

1562
01:21:09,510 --> 01:21:11,095
Bail for 20's kind of pricey.

1563
01:21:11,178 --> 01:21:13,222
You bailed all those people out?

1564
01:21:13,306 --> 01:21:14,724
You upset with me?

1565
01:21:14,807 --> 01:21:16,100
I'm sorry.

1566
01:21:16,184 --> 01:21:18,520
Hon, it just seemed
like the right thing.

1567
01:21:18,603 --> 01:21:21,231
Oh, Wilbur, it was the right thing.

1568
01:21:22,774 --> 01:21:25,694
Knights in armour
don't come any shinier than you.

1569
01:21:26,904 --> 01:21:28,614
But where's our little girl?

1570
01:21:31,408 --> 01:21:32,868
Are you okay, Trace?

1571
01:21:32,952 --> 01:21:34,412
Oh, you have no idea.

1572
01:21:35,997 --> 01:21:37,999
- Come on.
- Thank you so much.

1573
01:21:38,082 --> 01:21:39,751
You're such a great friend.

1574
01:21:39,834 --> 01:21:40,877
Thanks.

1575
01:21:41,711 --> 01:21:44,381
Penny, the cops are looking
for me everywhere.

1576
01:21:44,464 --> 01:21:45,924
You could go to jail for helping me.

1577
01:21:46,007 --> 01:21:48,176
Tracy, I'm already in jail. Come on.

1578
01:21:51,889 --> 01:21:52,932
- Oh, no.
- What?

1579
01:21:53,015 --> 01:21:54,183
Your hair deflated.

1580
01:21:54,266 --> 01:21:55,309
Oh, let it.

1581
01:21:55,392 --> 01:21:57,979
It was just a symbol
of my conformity to the man.

1582
01:21:58,062 --> 01:21:59,188
You are so tough.

1583
01:22:00,273 --> 01:22:01,316
So, what do you think?

1584
01:22:01,399 --> 01:22:03,067
Maybe you could live down here.

1585
01:22:03,151 --> 01:22:04,986
I don't even know why we
have this room down here,

1586
01:22:05,070 --> 01:22:07,781
but there's food,
water, first aid kit,

1587
01:22:07,906 --> 01:22:10,325
gas mask, Russian-language books.

1588
01:22:10,409 --> 01:22:11,827
It's very well-insulated.

1589
01:22:11,910 --> 01:22:15,080
It won't be where you're going.
The police are on their way.

1590
01:22:15,164 --> 01:22:17,333
Mom, please don't send my best friend
to the big house.

1591
01:22:17,416 --> 01:22:18,459
Penny, hush.

1592
01:22:18,542 --> 01:22:20,586
You haven't heard the last
of me, Mrs Pingleton.

1593
01:22:20,670 --> 01:22:21,712
Things need to change

1594
01:22:21,796 --> 01:22:23,673
and I won't stop trying
to change them.

1595
01:22:23,756 --> 01:22:25,174
I don't care how long it takes.

1596
01:22:25,258 --> 01:22:27,302
Good, you'll be waiting 20 to life.

1597
01:22:27,385 --> 01:22:28,428
Get the jump rope, Penny.

1598
01:22:28,511 --> 01:22:31,056
- Mom, not the jump rope!
- Don't you touch my canned tuna.

1599
01:22:32,766 --> 01:22:34,518
You wait till your father
gets out of prison.

1600
01:22:34,601 --> 01:22:36,812
You'll see
more than a jump rope, missy!

1601
01:22:36,895 --> 01:22:40,608
<i>A massive manhunt is underway
for Miss Turnblad...</i>

1602
01:22:40,691 --> 01:22:43,569
<i>who bludgeoned sergeant
and decorated Korean war veteran,</i>

1603
01:22:43,653 --> 01:22:45,655
<i>Mike Morris, with a crowbar,</i>

1604
01:22:45,738 --> 01:22:47,198
<i>- shattering his jaw...</i>
- That is a lie!

1605
01:22:47,282 --> 01:22:50,410
They're talking
about our baby, Wilbur.

1606
01:22:50,493 --> 01:22:51,912
They're telling lies.

1607
01:22:51,995 --> 01:22:53,246
<i>Sergeant Morris
is in critical condition.</i>

1608
01:22:53,330 --> 01:22:54,873
This is such a Midol moment.

1609
01:22:54,956 --> 01:22:56,291
Wilbur, that... Oh!

1610
01:22:56,375 --> 01:22:58,293
Maybe that's her. Oh, that's her.

1611
01:22:59,336 --> 01:23:01,130
Is that you, Tracy?

1612
01:23:02,256 --> 01:23:04,425
Oh, Link. I thought you'd be Tracy.

1613
01:23:04,508 --> 01:23:08,179
Uh, no. I was just at home, uh,
practicing my new twist on the twist

1614
01:23:08,262 --> 01:23:10,348
and I overheard it on the news.

1615
01:23:10,473 --> 01:23:14,060
I can't believe Tracy
savagely bludgeoned an Eagle Scout.

1616
01:23:14,144 --> 01:23:16,688
- That's just not like her.
- Well, it's not true. I was there.

1617
01:23:16,772 --> 01:23:17,898
He didn't even bleed.

1618
01:23:17,981 --> 01:23:19,107
I should have been there...

1619
01:23:19,608 --> 01:23:20,943
beside her.

1620
01:23:21,026 --> 01:23:23,153
I can't sleep, I can't eat.

1621
01:23:23,237 --> 01:23:24,530
You can't eat?

1622
01:23:24,613 --> 01:23:26,365
Well, come on in and worry with us.

1623
01:23:26,449 --> 01:23:27,992
I'll make you some pork.

1624
01:23:28,075 --> 01:23:29,535
Penny Lou Pingleton,

1625
01:23:29,619 --> 01:23:33,790
you are absolutely, positively,
permanently punished.

1626
01:23:33,873 --> 01:23:37,210
You will live on a diet
of saltines and Tang,

1627
01:23:37,627 --> 01:23:40,589
and you will never leave
this room again.

1628
01:23:43,884 --> 01:23:45,970
Devil child! Devil child!

1629
01:23:53,978 --> 01:23:56,439
Seaweed. Don't let her hear you.

1630
01:23:56,523 --> 01:23:57,857
Penny, what happened to you?

1631
01:23:57,941 --> 01:23:59,568
She's punishing me
for harbouring a fugitive

1632
01:23:59,651 --> 01:24:00,944
without her permission.

1633
01:24:01,027 --> 01:24:02,154
What are you doing?

1634
01:24:02,946 --> 01:24:05,282
I'm here to rescue
the fair maiden, baby.

1635
01:24:10,621 --> 01:24:12,665
Oh, Seaweed, you do care.

1636
01:24:12,748 --> 01:24:15,168
I was afraid the colours of our skin
would keep us apart.

1637
01:24:15,251 --> 01:24:16,294
No.

1638
01:24:17,504 --> 01:24:20,131
These knots might.
Was your mom in the navy?

1639
01:24:25,345 --> 01:24:30,100
<i>Once I was a selfish fool
Who never understood</i>

1640
01:24:30,184 --> 01:24:32,436
<i>Never looked inside myself</i>

1641
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:35,064
<i>Though on the outside, I looked good</i>

1642
01:24:35,147 --> 01:24:39,819
<i>Then we met and you made me
The man I am today</i>

1643
01:24:39,903 --> 01:24:44,115
<i>Tracy, I'm in love with you
No matter what you weigh</i>

1644
01:24:44,199 --> 01:24:46,118
<i>- 'Cause without love
- Without love</i>

1645
01:24:46,201 --> 01:24:49,121
<i>Life is like the seasons
with no summer</i>

1646
01:24:49,204 --> 01:24:50,956
<i>- Without love
- Without love</i>

1647
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:54,126
<i>Life is rock 'n' roll
Without a drummer</i>

1648
01:24:54,210 --> 01:24:56,462
<i>Tracy, I'll be yours forever</i>

1649
01:24:56,545 --> 01:24:58,881
<i>'Cause I never wanna be</i>

1650
01:24:58,965 --> 01:25:02,677
<i>- Without love
- Without love</i>

1651
01:25:02,761 --> 01:25:05,055
<i>Tracy, never set me free</i>

1652
01:25:06,056 --> 01:25:08,100
<i>- No, I ain't lying
- I ain't lying</i>

1653
01:25:08,183 --> 01:25:09,893
<i>- Never set me free
- Never set me free</i>

1654
01:25:09,977 --> 01:25:12,813
<i>Tracy, no, no, no</i>

1655
01:25:14,315 --> 01:25:18,653
<i>Living in the ghetto
Black is everywhere you go</i>

1656
01:25:19,362 --> 01:25:21,531
<i>Who'd have thought I'd love a girl</i>

1657
01:25:21,614 --> 01:25:24,200
<i>Whose skin was white as winter snow?</i>

1658
01:25:24,284 --> 01:25:25,952
<i>In my ivory tower</i>

1659
01:25:26,036 --> 01:25:28,663
<i>Life was just a hostess snack</i>

1660
01:25:28,747 --> 01:25:30,916
<i>But now I've tasted chocolate</i>

1661
01:25:30,999 --> 01:25:33,001
<i>And I'm never going back</i>

1662
01:25:33,085 --> 01:25:35,087
<i>'Cause without love</i>

1663
01:25:35,170 --> 01:25:38,215
<i>Life is like a beat
That you can't follow</i>

1664
01:25:38,299 --> 01:25:40,051
<i>Without love</i>

1665
01:25:40,134 --> 01:25:43,179
<i>Life is Doris Day at the Apollo</i>

1666
01:25:43,262 --> 01:25:45,556
<i>Darling, I'll be yours forever</i>

1667
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:47,976
<i>'Cause I never wanna be</i>

1668
01:25:48,059 --> 01:25:51,354
<i>Without love</i>

1669
01:25:51,438 --> 01:25:55,067
<i>So, darling, never set me free, no</i>

1670
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:57,069
<i>- I'm yours forever
- I'm yours forever</i>

1671
01:25:57,152 --> 01:25:59,655
<i>- Never set me free
- Never set me free</i>

1672
01:25:59,738 --> 01:26:01,991
<i>No, no, no</i>

1673
01:26:05,161 --> 01:26:07,830
<i>If I'm left without my baby doll</i>

1674
01:26:07,914 --> 01:26:10,625
<i>I don't know what I'll do</i>

1675
01:26:10,709 --> 01:26:12,502
<i>Link, I've got to break out</i>

1676
01:26:12,586 --> 01:26:15,630
<i>So that I can get my hands on you</i>

1677
01:26:15,714 --> 01:26:20,469
<i>Girl, if I can't touch you
Then I'm gonna lose control</i>

1678
01:26:20,552 --> 01:26:22,847
<i>Seaweed, you're my black white knight</i>

1679
01:26:22,930 --> 01:26:25,141
<i>I've found my blue-eyed soul</i>

1680
01:26:25,224 --> 01:26:27,059
<i>Sweet freedom is our goal</i>

1681
01:26:27,894 --> 01:26:29,812
<i>Trace, I wanna kiss you!</i>

1682
01:26:29,896 --> 01:26:32,107
<i>Let me out at the next toll!</i>

1683
01:26:32,190 --> 01:26:34,025
<i>Without love</i>

1684
01:26:34,109 --> 01:26:37,028
<i>Life is like a prom
That won't invite us</i>

1685
01:26:37,112 --> 01:26:38,280
<i>Without love</i>

1686
01:26:38,363 --> 01:26:41,950
<i>It's like getting my big break
And laryngitis</i>

1687
01:26:42,034 --> 01:26:43,577
<i>Without love</i>

1688
01:26:43,661 --> 01:26:46,789
<i>Life's a 45 when you can't buy it</i>

1689
01:26:46,872 --> 01:26:48,624
<i>Without love</i>

1690
01:26:48,708 --> 01:26:51,794
<i>Life is like my mother on a diet</i>

1691
01:26:51,878 --> 01:26:54,172
<i>Like a week that's only Mondays</i>

1692
01:26:54,255 --> 01:26:56,716
<i>Only ice cream, never sundaes</i>

1693
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:59,094
<i>Like a circle with no centre</i>

1694
01:26:59,177 --> 01:27:01,388
<i>Like a door marked "Do Not Enter"</i>

1695
01:27:01,471 --> 01:27:03,932
<i>Darling, I'll be yours forever</i>

1696
01:27:04,016 --> 01:27:06,393
<i>'Cause I never wanna be</i>

1697
01:27:06,477 --> 01:27:09,730
<i>Without love</i>

1698
01:27:09,814 --> 01:27:11,607
<i>- Yes, now you've captured me
- Now you've captured me</i>

1699
01:27:11,691 --> 01:27:14,360
<i>Without love</i>

1700
01:27:14,444 --> 01:27:16,362
<i>I surrender happily</i>

1701
01:27:16,446 --> 01:27:19,491
<i>Without love</i>

1702
01:27:19,574 --> 01:27:22,035
<i>Oh, Seaweed, never set me free</i>

1703
01:27:22,119 --> 01:27:23,537
<i>No, no, no</i>

1704
01:27:23,620 --> 01:27:25,122
<i>I ain't lying</i>

1705
01:27:25,456 --> 01:27:27,875
<i>Never set me free</i>

1706
01:27:27,958 --> 01:27:29,752
<i>No, no, no</i>

1707
01:27:29,835 --> 01:27:31,545
<i>No, I don't wanna live without</i>

1708
01:27:31,629 --> 01:27:34,048
<i>Love, love, love</i>

1709
01:27:34,132 --> 01:27:35,216
<i>Pretty Penny little</i>

1710
01:27:35,341 --> 01:27:38,887
<i>Darling, you had best believe me</i>

1711
01:27:38,970 --> 01:27:42,474
<i>Never leave me without love</i>

1712
01:27:43,725 --> 01:27:45,727
Link, your pork is ready.

1713
01:27:46,228 --> 01:27:47,729
- Uh, Mama, I...
- You trying to hide her here?

1714
01:27:51,775 --> 01:27:53,569
Why you ain't think of that before?

1715
01:27:53,652 --> 01:27:56,113
Everything she done for us.
Where your manners at, boy?

1716
01:27:56,197 --> 01:27:57,240
Well, I don't know.

1717
01:27:59,409 --> 01:28:00,493
And what about this one?

1718
01:28:01,369 --> 01:28:02,871
Seaweed's got a girlfriend.

1719
01:28:02,954 --> 01:28:04,039
Inez, shut up.

1720
01:28:04,122 --> 01:28:05,457
- You.
- Oh.

1721
01:28:05,540 --> 01:28:06,917
So this is love.

1722
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:10,045
Well, love is a gift.

1723
01:28:10,129 --> 01:28:11,588
Lotta people don't remember that.

1724
01:28:12,423 --> 01:28:16,218
So you two better brace yourselves
for a whole lotta ugly coming at you

1725
01:28:16,302 --> 01:28:18,304
from a never-ending parade of stupid.

1726
01:28:18,387 --> 01:28:19,847
So you met my mom?

1727
01:28:23,977 --> 01:28:25,020
Hello?

1728
01:28:25,103 --> 01:28:26,897
- Mom? Yes, I'm safe.
<i>- Tracy, are you okay?</i>

1729
01:28:26,980 --> 01:28:28,273
<i>- Oh, my god.</i>
- Mom, listen.

1730
01:28:28,356 --> 01:28:30,359
<i>- Where are you? What?</i>
- I need your help.

1731
01:28:30,442 --> 01:28:32,945
<i>Tomorrow's the Miss Teenage
Hairspray pageant.</i>

1732
01:28:33,028 --> 01:28:34,613
<i>I need you to come down
to the station.</i>

1733
01:28:34,697 --> 01:28:36,156
<i>- Well, Tracy...
- Dress nice.</i>

1734
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:37,908
<i>- What?
- Penny will meet you out front.</i>

1735
01:28:37,992 --> 01:28:39,327
<i>- Tracy...
- Now let me talk to Dad.</i>

1736
01:28:41,454 --> 01:28:44,040
Turn your face this way.
The other way. Go.

1737
01:28:44,123 --> 01:28:46,376
Everybody, please take your seats.

1738
01:28:46,459 --> 01:28:49,629
The Miss Teenage Hairspray Pageant
is about to begin.

1739
01:28:55,844 --> 01:28:57,680
Oh, you've come
on a very exciting day.

1740
01:28:57,763 --> 01:29:00,391
It's our... first live show.

1741
01:29:00,474 --> 01:29:01,976
Oh! Bye-bye, Birdie.

1742
01:29:02,810 --> 01:29:04,437
My Amber is perfect for that.

1743
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:06,397
She's the pretty little blonde.

1744
01:29:08,316 --> 01:29:14,239
And we're live
in five, four, three...

1745
01:29:17,117 --> 01:29:20,788
And now, broadcast live
in front of a live studio audience

1746
01:29:20,871 --> 01:29:25,251
for the first time from the certified
up-to-code WYZT studio,

1747
01:29:25,334 --> 01:29:28,838
it's the Corny Collins
Miss Hairspray Spectacular.

1748
01:29:29,255 --> 01:29:30,590
- He's Corny.
- He's Corny.

1749
01:29:30,673 --> 01:29:33,134
Brought to you
by Ultra Clutch hairspray.

1750
01:29:34,094 --> 01:29:37,055
<i>What gives a girl power and punch</i>

1751
01:29:37,139 --> 01:29:38,891
<i>Is it charm, is it poise</i>

1752
01:29:38,974 --> 01:29:41,060
<i>No, it's hairspray</i>

1753
01:29:41,143 --> 01:29:44,105
<i>What gets a gal asked out to lunch</i>

1754
01:29:44,188 --> 01:29:45,940
<i>Is it brains, is it dough</i>

1755
01:29:46,023 --> 01:29:48,192
<i>No, it's hairspray</i>

1756
01:29:48,276 --> 01:29:51,029
<i>If you take a ride
With no can at your side...</i>

1757
01:29:51,112 --> 01:29:53,448
"And preserve our family
through our father."

1758
01:29:53,990 --> 01:29:56,743
"Let us make our father drink wine,
and let us lie with him."

1759
01:29:56,827 --> 01:29:58,578
<i>You can take off in a rocket</i>

1760
01:29:58,662 --> 01:30:02,040
<i>And in outer space
Each hair will be in place</i>

1761
01:30:02,124 --> 01:30:03,709
Link, the agents are here. Look.

1762
01:30:04,209 --> 01:30:05,628
<i>...When you get up and dance?</i>

1763
01:30:05,711 --> 01:30:07,380
<i>If you twist, I insist</i>

1764
01:30:07,463 --> 01:30:10,424
<i>You use hairspray
And tell your mother</i>

1765
01:30:10,508 --> 01:30:11,843
Maybe they'll sign us together.

1766
01:30:11,926 --> 01:30:16,097
<i>...She should smother
With Ultra Clutch faithfully</i>

1767
01:30:16,181 --> 01:30:17,390
Well?

1768
01:30:17,474 --> 01:30:19,142
There's no sign of her.
We're on every door.

1769
01:30:19,226 --> 01:30:20,352
She's not inside.

1770
01:30:21,269 --> 01:30:22,896
Doesn't mean she won't try.

1771
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:25,816
Velma, I seriously doubt
this girl's gonna risk incarceration

1772
01:30:25,899 --> 01:30:26,942
to win a pageant.

1773
01:30:27,026 --> 01:30:28,569
<i>That's me!</i>

1774
01:30:28,652 --> 01:30:31,948
I risked communicable diseases.
She'll certainly risk jail.

1775
01:30:32,031 --> 01:30:34,617
<i>Better than hairspray</i>

1776
01:30:35,535 --> 01:30:38,538
<i>That's me</i>

1777
01:30:46,922 --> 01:30:50,509
<i>What makes a man reach out and
touch?</i>

1778
01:30:50,593 --> 01:30:52,094
<i>Ultra Clutch</i>

1779
01:30:54,138 --> 01:30:58,393
<i>So if you're a redhead
A blonde, or brunette</i>

1780
01:30:58,935 --> 01:31:03,064
<i>Just take my advice
And you might just get</i>

1781
01:31:03,148 --> 01:31:06,568
<i>The only thing better than hairspray</i>

1782
01:31:06,652 --> 01:31:09,571
<i>That's me</i>

1783
01:31:09,655 --> 01:31:11,615
<i>- Ah!
- He's Corny Collins</i>

1784
01:31:11,699 --> 01:31:15,328
<i>The only thing better than hairspray</i>

1785
01:31:15,411 --> 01:31:17,205
<i>- Hairspray
- Wow!</i>

1786
01:31:17,288 --> 01:31:20,041
<i>That's me</i>

1787
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:25,255
Hey, baby, you look like
you could use a stiff one.

1788
01:31:32,763 --> 01:31:34,306
And we are out.

1789
01:31:35,558 --> 01:31:37,059
Link, you sprayed it
right in my face!

1790
01:31:37,143 --> 01:31:38,686
What'd I tell you about that?

1791
01:31:39,228 --> 01:31:40,605
Stop! You guys.

1792
01:31:41,147 --> 01:31:42,273
Uh, powder.

1793
01:31:42,357 --> 01:31:45,318
And we're back. Five, four...

1794
01:31:45,402 --> 01:31:46,945
- Here?
- Three.

1795
01:31:49,072 --> 01:31:51,199
And now for the talent portion
of our competition,

1796
01:31:51,283 --> 01:31:52,326
our Councilettes

1797
01:31:52,409 --> 01:31:55,412
in their Miss Teenage Hairspray
official dance-off.

1798
01:32:00,001 --> 01:32:04,464
First off, we have the sunny pride
of Highlandtown, Darla.

1799
01:32:08,927 --> 01:32:11,012
Hello, Darla.

1800
01:32:11,096 --> 01:32:13,515
Miss Teenage Hairspray.
Your vote is for?

1801
01:32:14,766 --> 01:32:17,728
This little girl could power
all of greater downtown Baltimore

1802
01:32:17,811 --> 01:32:18,854
with her energy.

1803
01:32:18,938 --> 01:32:20,064
Lou Ann.

1804
01:32:23,150 --> 01:32:25,695
Who are you voting for? Lou Ann?

1805
01:32:26,321 --> 01:32:27,947
Very good, thank you.

1806
01:32:30,742 --> 01:32:32,035
All right.

1807
01:32:33,411 --> 01:32:36,748
Ladies and gentlemen,
the almost too happy Tammy.

1808
01:32:47,593 --> 01:32:49,345
And thank you, Tammy.

1809
01:32:58,355 --> 01:33:00,190
- Confirmed sighting.
<i>- What?</i>

1810
01:33:00,274 --> 01:33:02,443
You three. Outside, now.

1811
01:33:02,526 --> 01:33:04,695
- We can't go out...
- No, no. No buts. Out, out!

1812
01:33:04,779 --> 01:33:06,322
Whatever you say, Mrs Von Tussle.

1813
01:33:12,328 --> 01:33:14,581
Aw, she's too cute, isn't she?

1814
01:33:14,664 --> 01:33:16,166
Hold it right there, Tracy.

1815
01:33:17,292 --> 01:33:18,543
Looking for someone?

1816
01:33:18,627 --> 01:33:20,629
All right, ladies and gentlemen...

1817
01:33:21,839 --> 01:33:23,298
- A what?
<i>- It was a diversion.</i>

1818
01:33:23,382 --> 01:33:25,885
Oh, please, these people
are not capable of a diversion.

1819
01:33:25,968 --> 01:33:27,470
It's beyond their mental capacity.

1820
01:33:27,553 --> 01:33:28,596
<i>I wouldn't be so sure, Velma.</i>

1821
01:33:28,679 --> 01:33:29,722
Oh, my god.

1822
01:33:29,805 --> 01:33:31,015
What if she's already
in the building?

1823
01:33:31,098 --> 01:33:34,435
What if she's been here for hours
and you've locked yourselves out?

1824
01:33:34,519 --> 01:33:35,562
What?

1825
01:33:35,645 --> 01:33:36,730
Check the doors!

1826
01:33:36,813 --> 01:33:37,981
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1827
01:33:38,064 --> 01:33:39,441
It's locked!

1828
01:33:39,524 --> 01:33:40,609
It's all locked!

1829
01:33:40,692 --> 01:33:43,570
And now a fast girl
who loves to slow dance,

1830
01:33:43,654 --> 01:33:46,031
our own smooth-as-silk Shelley.

1831
01:33:48,117 --> 01:33:50,161
Keep going. Keep going. That's it.

1832
01:33:50,870 --> 01:33:52,747
- Come on.
- Put your backs into it, men.

1833
01:33:52,830 --> 01:33:54,582
Put your backs into it this time.

1834
01:33:56,376 --> 01:33:58,253
Come on, one more time.
One more time.

1835
01:33:58,837 --> 01:34:00,755
Come on, come on, come on.

1836
01:34:07,471 --> 01:34:10,558
Here's our little dynamic duo
from Conkling Street.

1837
01:34:12,101 --> 01:34:13,728
Double your fun
with Noreen and Doreen.

1838
01:34:13,811 --> 01:34:14,979
What is with you people?

1839
01:34:15,062 --> 01:34:16,856
I mean, how hard is it
to beat down a door?

1840
01:34:16,939 --> 01:34:19,275
That hairspray battering ram
was heavy.

1841
01:34:19,359 --> 01:34:20,610
Heavy?

1842
01:34:20,693 --> 01:34:22,404
How could they be heavy? They're...

1843
01:34:23,363 --> 01:34:24,614
hollow.

1844
01:34:26,283 --> 01:34:27,659
Move it.

1845
01:34:27,743 --> 01:34:29,286
Let's get them. Let's go.

1846
01:34:48,265 --> 01:34:52,144
And of course, our three-time
Miss Hairspray champion,

1847
01:34:52,227 --> 01:34:54,146
the ever-charming, Amber.

1848
01:34:56,607 --> 01:34:57,775
Oh, my god.

1849
01:34:57,858 --> 01:34:59,861
You carried her in!

1850
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:01,863
Go!

1851
01:35:12,541 --> 01:35:14,251
- It's locked.
- Open it!

1852
01:35:15,127 --> 01:35:16,712
Let's give a final round of applause

1853
01:35:16,795 --> 01:35:19,256
to our Miss Teenage
Hairspray contestants.

1854
01:35:24,595 --> 01:35:25,638
Hey.

1855
01:35:33,105 --> 01:35:34,606
All right, all right.

1856
01:35:37,109 --> 01:35:40,779
We are so close to announcing
the new Miss Teenage Hairspray.

1857
01:35:40,863 --> 01:35:41,906
Look at that board.

1858
01:35:41,989 --> 01:35:44,742
What a nail-biter
this one is turning into.

1859
01:35:46,119 --> 01:35:48,121
Ladies and gentlemen,
the final tally.

1860
01:35:58,006 --> 01:35:59,258
It is my...

1861
01:35:59,675 --> 01:36:00,718
obligation...

1862
01:36:01,635 --> 01:36:04,013
to announce that Amber Von Tussle...

1863
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:05,973
Is about to get out-danced.

1864
01:36:07,517 --> 01:36:09,227
Tracy Turnblad!

1865
01:36:14,899 --> 01:36:15,942
What?

1866
01:36:17,277 --> 01:36:19,696
<i>You can't stop an avalanche</i>

1867
01:36:19,780 --> 01:36:22,324
<i>As it races down the hill</i>

1868
01:36:22,408 --> 01:36:25,369
<i>You can try to stop the seasons, girl</i>

1869
01:36:25,452 --> 01:36:27,997
<i>But you know you never will</i>

1870
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:30,958
<i>And you can try to stop
My dancing feet</i>

1871
01:36:31,042 --> 01:36:33,753
<i>But I just cannot stand still</i>

1872
01:36:33,837 --> 01:36:36,673
<i>'Cause the world keeps spinning
Round and round</i>

1873
01:36:36,756 --> 01:36:39,426
<i>And my heart's keeping time
To the speed of sound</i>

1874
01:36:39,509 --> 01:36:41,470
<i>I was lost till I heard the drums</i>

1875
01:36:41,553 --> 01:36:44,098
<i>- Then I found my way</i>
- No.

1876
01:36:44,181 --> 01:36:45,933
<i>- 'Cause you can't stop the beat</i>
- Link!

1877
01:36:46,016 --> 01:36:48,018
<i>Ever since this old world began</i>

1878
01:36:48,102 --> 01:36:50,855
<i>A woman found out if she shook it
She could shake up a man</i>

1879
01:36:50,938 --> 01:36:52,565
This throne is mine!

1880
01:36:52,648 --> 01:36:55,318
<i>The best that I can today</i>

1881
01:36:55,401 --> 01:36:56,736
<i>- 'Cause you can't stop</i>
- Let me down!

1882
01:36:56,820 --> 01:36:59,322
<i>The motion of the ocean
Or the sun in the sky</i>

1883
01:36:59,406 --> 01:37:02,033
<i>You can wonder if you wanna
But I never ask why</i>

1884
01:37:02,117 --> 01:37:03,702
<i>And if you try to hold me down</i>

1885
01:37:03,785 --> 01:37:06,622
<i>I'm gonna spit in your eye and say</i>

1886
01:37:06,705 --> 01:37:09,458
<i>That you can't stop the beat</i>

1887
01:37:13,546 --> 01:37:14,630
They love you, Link.

1888
01:37:18,927 --> 01:37:20,595
Yeah? Not for long.

1889
01:37:22,514 --> 01:37:23,974
Inez, come on!

1890
01:37:26,226 --> 01:37:27,477
Let's dance.

1891
01:37:32,066 --> 01:37:35,236
Little Miss Inez Stubbs,
ladies and gentlemen.

1892
01:37:35,319 --> 01:37:36,612
Look at my baby go.

1893
01:37:43,745 --> 01:37:45,664
- Inez.
- Inez?

1894
01:37:52,713 --> 01:37:53,756
Come on.

1895
01:37:59,762 --> 01:38:02,015
Oh, there you go!
Give her a hand, folks!

1896
01:38:02,098 --> 01:38:05,143
Little Miss Inez Stubbs,
ladies and gentlemen.

1897
01:38:10,691 --> 01:38:15,863
<i>You can't stop a river
As it rushes to the sea</i>

1898
01:38:15,946 --> 01:38:18,741
<i>You can try to stop the hands of time</i>

1899
01:38:18,824 --> 01:38:21,494
<i>But you know it just can't be</i>

1900
01:38:21,577 --> 01:38:24,372
<i>And if they try to stop us, Seaweed</i>

1901
01:38:24,455 --> 01:38:27,083
<i>- We'll call the N-double A-C-P
- We'll call the N-double A-C-P</i>

1902
01:38:27,167 --> 01:38:30,003
<i>'Cause the world keeps spinning
Round and round</i>

1903
01:38:30,086 --> 01:38:32,881
<i>And my heart's keeping time
To the speed of sound</i>

1904
01:38:32,965 --> 01:38:34,967
<i>I was lost till I heard the drums</i>

1905
01:38:35,050 --> 01:38:37,386
<i>Then I found my way</i>

1906
01:38:37,469 --> 01:38:39,221
<i>'Cause you can't stop the beat</i>

1907
01:38:39,305 --> 01:38:41,390
<i>Ever since we first saw the light</i>

1908
01:38:41,474 --> 01:38:44,185
<i>A man and woman liked to shake it
On a Saturday night</i>

1909
01:38:44,268 --> 01:38:45,895
<i>And so I'm gonna shake and shimmy it</i>

1910
01:38:45,979 --> 01:38:47,021
<i>- With all of my might</i>
- Mother!

1911
01:38:47,105 --> 01:38:48,731
<i>Today</i>

1912
01:38:48,815 --> 01:38:50,066
<i>'Cause you can't stop</i>

1913
01:38:50,150 --> 01:38:52,777
<i>The motion of the ocean
Or the rain from above</i>

1914
01:38:52,861 --> 01:38:54,404
<i>- They can try to stop the paradise</i>
- Hello?

1915
01:38:54,488 --> 01:38:55,530
<i>We're dreaming of</i>

1916
01:38:55,614 --> 01:38:58,283
<i>But you cannot stop the rhythm
Of two hearts in love</i>

1917
01:38:58,367 --> 01:38:59,994
<i>To stay</i>

1918
01:39:00,077 --> 01:39:03,205
<i>'Cause you can't stop the beat</i>

1919
01:39:04,999 --> 01:39:06,083
Amen.

1920
01:39:06,167 --> 01:39:08,878
<i>I am now a checkerboard chick.</i>

1921
01:39:10,213 --> 01:39:12,006
Penny! No!

1922
01:39:28,566 --> 01:39:30,318
Live television.
There's nothing like it.

1923
01:39:31,819 --> 01:39:32,862
Penny!

1924
01:39:39,870 --> 01:39:42,498
- And now, it's the moment...
- Wait, wait, wait!

1925
01:39:42,581 --> 01:39:43,832
We have to wait
till they go to commercial.

1926
01:39:43,916 --> 01:39:46,335
As you know, we've kept
the lines open up to the last minute.

1927
01:39:46,418 --> 01:39:48,587
And those lines
have been burning up our switchboard.

1928
01:39:48,671 --> 01:39:50,089
Never in the history of this pageant

1929
01:39:50,172 --> 01:39:52,300
has there been such a surge
of late voting.

1930
01:39:54,552 --> 01:39:55,720
Baltimore, you've picked a winner.

1931
01:39:56,971 --> 01:40:00,100
And the new Miss Hairspray is...

1932
01:40:01,017 --> 01:40:02,561
- Inez Stubbs!
- What?

1933
01:40:03,395 --> 01:40:05,355
Inez, you done it! You did it!

1934
01:40:05,439 --> 01:40:07,066
How about that?

1935
01:40:07,149 --> 01:40:08,317
Yes!

1936
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:09,860
Come on over here, Little Inez.

1937
01:40:10,277 --> 01:40:11,529
Go, babe!

1938
01:40:11,612 --> 01:40:13,990
Oh! Inez! Oh, my god!

1939
01:40:16,451 --> 01:40:19,162
That's my baby! That's my baby girl!

1940
01:40:24,918 --> 01:40:26,170
But... she's...

1941
01:40:26,962 --> 01:40:28,339
She's not even a candidate.

1942
01:40:28,422 --> 01:40:30,841
She just got
a tidal wave of calls, Velma.

1943
01:40:30,925 --> 01:40:32,677
But this is invalid.
This is impossible.

1944
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:34,512
Well, anyone who dances for it
is eligible.

1945
01:40:34,595 --> 01:40:37,849
Rule 30, paragraph five, asterisk,
down at the bottom. Okay.

1946
01:40:37,932 --> 01:40:39,893
Well, this also makes you
the lead dancer

1947
01:40:39,976 --> 01:40:41,269
on <i>The Corny Collins Show.</i>

1948
01:40:43,230 --> 01:40:44,898
Ladies and gentlemen,
<i>The Corny Collins Show</i>

1949
01:40:44,981 --> 01:40:47,401
is now and forever
officially integrated!

1950
01:40:56,994 --> 01:40:58,830
All right. Yeah.

1951
01:41:01,416 --> 01:41:05,879
Interracial dancing has broken out
at the WYZT stage.

1952
01:41:07,005 --> 01:41:08,924
Just look at the crowd's reaction.

1953
01:41:09,967 --> 01:41:11,301
Back to you, Steve.

1954
01:41:11,385 --> 01:41:14,763
<i>...Heard the drums
Then I found my way</i>

1955
01:41:14,847 --> 01:41:16,974
<i>'Cause you can't stop the beat</i>

1956
01:41:18,351 --> 01:41:19,810
Amber, stop it!

1957
01:41:23,231 --> 01:41:25,233
I lost, Mom. Let's just deal with it.

1958
01:41:25,316 --> 01:41:26,526
No, you did not lose.

1959
01:41:26,609 --> 01:41:30,781
You cannot have lost
because I switched the damn tallies.

1960
01:41:30,864 --> 01:41:32,366
Smile, Miss Crabmeat.

1961
01:41:32,449 --> 01:41:34,284
You're on <i>Candid Camera.</i>

1962
01:41:36,328 --> 01:41:38,289
That was a good shot,
don't you think?

1963
01:41:38,372 --> 01:41:39,415
Not bad.

1964
01:41:41,834 --> 01:41:43,211
What are you doing?

1965
01:41:44,212 --> 01:41:45,546
Get that away from me!

1966
01:41:46,381 --> 01:41:47,757
Go to commercial!

1967
01:41:47,841 --> 01:41:48,883
Go!

1968
01:41:50,010 --> 01:41:51,052
Velma!

1969
01:41:58,894 --> 01:41:59,979
Pack your desk.

1970
01:42:00,437 --> 01:42:02,064
You've tainted the name
of Ultra Clutch.

1971
01:42:03,566 --> 01:42:06,235
How can you taint
a cancerous can of chemicals?

1972
01:42:07,028 --> 01:42:08,071
You're fired!

1973
01:42:08,780 --> 01:42:10,365
I can't be fired.

1974
01:42:10,448 --> 01:42:11,700
Oh, yeah?

1975
01:42:14,202 --> 01:42:17,539
Last chance to join the dance, folks.
Everyone is welcome!

1976
01:42:18,123 --> 01:42:19,249
Wilbur...

1977
01:42:19,875 --> 01:42:23,379
Do it now or forever wish you had.

1978
01:42:23,462 --> 01:42:24,547
Really?

1979
01:42:24,630 --> 01:42:26,090
Show them, baby.

1980
01:42:29,677 --> 01:42:31,262
Nobody can dance like you.

1981
01:42:39,062 --> 01:42:44,109
<i>You can't stop my happiness
'Cause I like the way I am</i>

1982
01:42:44,193 --> 01:42:46,862
<i>And you just can't stop
My knife and fork</i>

1983
01:42:46,946 --> 01:42:49,657
<i>When I see a Christmas ham</i>

1984
01:42:49,740 --> 01:42:52,493
<i>So if you don't like the way I look</i>

1985
01:42:52,577 --> 01:42:55,413
<i>Well, I just don't give a damn</i>

1986
01:42:55,497 --> 01:42:58,291
<i>'Cause the world keeps spinning
Round and round</i>

1987
01:42:58,375 --> 01:43:01,044
<i>And my heart's keeping time
To the speed of sound</i>

1988
01:43:01,128 --> 01:43:03,213
<i>I was lost till I heard the drums</i>

1989
01:43:03,297 --> 01:43:05,674
<i>Then I found my way</i>

1990
01:43:05,758 --> 01:43:07,468
<i>'Cause you can't stop the beat</i>

1991
01:43:07,593 --> 01:43:09,553
<i>Ever since this old world began</i>

1992
01:43:09,637 --> 01:43:12,390
<i>A woman found out if she shook it
She could shake up a man</i>

1993
01:43:12,473 --> 01:43:16,936
<i>And so I'm gonna shake and shimmy it
The best that I can today</i>

1994
01:43:17,020 --> 01:43:18,229
<i>'Cause you can't stop</i>

1995
01:43:18,313 --> 01:43:20,816
<i>The motion of the ocean
Or the sun in the sky</i>

1996
01:43:20,899 --> 01:43:23,735
<i>You can wonder if you wanna
But I'll never ask why</i>

1997
01:43:23,819 --> 01:43:28,198
<i>And if you try to hold me down
I'm gonna spit in your eye and say</i>

1998
01:43:28,282 --> 01:43:30,201
<i>That you can't stop the beat</i>

1999
01:44:00,650 --> 01:44:01,860
I love you!

2000
01:44:04,404 --> 01:44:05,447
You did great!

2001
01:44:07,616 --> 01:44:08,700
Corny, do something!

2002
01:44:09,451 --> 01:44:11,412
The show is turning to gumbo!

2003
01:44:12,079 --> 01:44:13,330
Not a chance, Velma.

2004
01:44:14,707 --> 01:44:15,958
This is the future.

2005
01:44:18,044 --> 01:44:20,004
Maybelle, let's go.

2006
01:44:20,505 --> 01:44:21,798
This is your time.

2007
01:44:27,387 --> 01:44:28,555
Yeah.

2008
01:44:28,638 --> 01:44:30,015
All right, Miss buttercup.

2009
01:44:30,098 --> 01:44:32,059
It's time to wrap this mutha up.

2010
01:44:32,142 --> 01:44:33,394
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

2011
01:44:33,477 --> 01:44:35,312
<i>- You can't stop today
- No!</i>

2012
01:44:35,396 --> 01:44:38,315
<i>As it comes speeding down the tracks</i>

2013
01:44:38,399 --> 01:44:40,985
<i>- Ooh, child, yes
- Child, yesterday is history</i>

2014
01:44:41,068 --> 01:44:43,821
<i>- Be gone!
- And it's never coming back</i>

2015
01:44:43,905 --> 01:44:47,283
<i>- Look ahead!
- 'Cause tomorrow is a brand-new day</i>

2016
01:44:47,367 --> 01:44:49,786
<i>- And it don't know white from black
- Yeah!</i>

2017
01:44:49,870 --> 01:44:52,748
<i>'Cause the world keeps spinning
Round and round</i>

2018
01:44:52,831 --> 01:44:55,584
<i>And my heart's keeping time
To the speed of sound</i>

2019
01:44:55,667 --> 01:44:57,753
<i>I was lost till I heard the drums</i>

2020
01:44:57,836 --> 01:45:00,047
<i>Then I found my way</i>

2021
01:45:00,131 --> 01:45:02,008
<i>'Cause you can't stop the beat</i>

2022
01:45:02,091 --> 01:45:04,010
<i>Ever since we first saw the light</i>

2023
01:45:04,093 --> 01:45:06,930
<i>A man and woman liked to shake it
On a Saturday night</i>

2024
01:45:07,013 --> 01:45:11,434
<i>And so I'm gonna shake and shimmy it
With all of my might today</i>

2025
01:45:11,518 --> 01:45:12,769
<i>'Cause you can't stop</i>

2026
01:45:12,853 --> 01:45:15,397
<i>The motion of the ocean
Or the rain from above</i>

2027
01:45:15,480 --> 01:45:18,275
<i>They can try to stop the paradise
We're dreaming of</i>

2028
01:45:18,359 --> 01:45:22,738
<i>But you cannot stop the rhythm
Of two hearts in love to stay</i>

2029
01:45:22,822 --> 01:45:26,159
<i>'Cause you can't stop the beat</i>

2030
01:45:33,250 --> 01:45:35,127
<i>Ever since we first saw the sun</i>

2031
01:45:35,210 --> 01:45:37,921
<i>A man and woman liked to shake it
When the day is done</i>

2032
01:45:38,005 --> 01:45:39,715
<i>And so we're gonna shake
And shimmy it</i>

2033
01:45:39,798 --> 01:45:42,551
<i>And have some fun today</i>

2034
01:45:42,635 --> 01:45:43,719
<i>'Cause you can't stop</i>

2035
01:45:43,803 --> 01:45:46,347
<i>The motion of the ocean
Or the rain from above</i>

2036
01:45:46,430 --> 01:45:49,267
<i>They can try to stop the paradise
We're dreaming of</i>

2037
01:45:49,350 --> 01:45:53,646
<i>But you'll never stop the rhythm
Of two hearts in love to stay</i>

2038
01:45:53,730 --> 01:45:56,858
<i>- 'Cause you can't stop the beat
- You can't stop the beat</i>

2039
01:45:56,942 --> 01:45:58,318
<i>You can't stop the beat</i>

2040
01:45:58,402 --> 01:45:59,778
<i>You can't stop the beat</i>

2041
01:45:59,861 --> 01:46:06,744
<i>You can't stop the beat</i>

2042
01:46:31,187 --> 01:46:33,523
<i>Hey, old friend, let's look back</i>

2043
01:46:33,606 --> 01:46:36,901
<i>On the crazy clothes we wore</i>

2044
01:46:36,985 --> 01:46:39,446
<i>Ain't it fun to look back</i>

2045
01:46:39,529 --> 01:46:42,657
<i>And to see it's all been done before</i>

2046
01:46:42,741 --> 01:46:48,122
<i>All those nights together
Are a special memory</i>

2047
01:46:48,205 --> 01:46:51,041
<i>And I can't wait for tomorrow</i>

2048
01:46:51,125 --> 01:46:53,878
<i>Just as long as you're dancing
Next to me</i>

2049
01:46:53,961 --> 01:46:56,839
<i>'Cause it's so clear, every year</i>

2050
01:46:56,923 --> 01:46:59,676
<i>- We get stronger
- Stronger</i>

2051
01:46:59,759 --> 01:47:02,804
<i>'Cause what's gone is gone
The past is the past</i>

2052
01:47:02,888 --> 01:47:04,097
<i>Turn the radio up</i>

2053
01:47:04,181 --> 01:47:06,308
<i>And then hit the gas 'cause</i>

2054
01:47:06,391 --> 01:47:12,314
<i>I know we've come so far
But we've got so far to go</i>

2055
01:47:12,398 --> 01:47:14,233
<i>I know the road seems long</i>

2056
01:47:14,316 --> 01:47:17,153
<i>But it won't be long
Till it's time to go</i>

2057
01:47:17,236 --> 01:47:23,576
<i>So, most days, we'll take it fast
And some nights, we'll take it slow</i>

2058
01:47:23,660 --> 01:47:25,996
<i>I know we've come so far</i>

2059
01:47:26,079 --> 01:47:31,668
<i>But, baby, baby
We've got so far to go</i>

2060
01:47:31,752 --> 01:47:34,964
<i>Oh, yeah, baby</i>

2061
01:47:35,047 --> 01:47:40,762
<i>Hey, old friend, together
Side by side and year by year</i>

2062
01:47:40,845 --> 01:47:43,306
<i>The road was filled
With twists and turns</i>

2063
01:47:43,389 --> 01:47:46,601
<i>Oh, but that's the road
That got us here</i>

2064
01:47:46,685 --> 01:47:49,187
<i>Let's move past the bad times</i>

2065
01:47:49,271 --> 01:47:52,357
<i>But before those memories fade</i>

2066
01:47:52,441 --> 01:47:55,152
<i>Let's forgive but not forget</i>

2067
01:47:55,235 --> 01:47:57,863
<i>And learn
From all the mistakes we made</i>

2068
01:47:57,947 --> 01:48:00,741
<i>'Cause it's so clear, every year</i>

2069
01:48:00,825 --> 01:48:03,661
<i>- We get stronger
- Stronger</i>

2070
01:48:03,745 --> 01:48:06,998
<i>So don't give up and don't say when</i>

2071
01:48:07,081 --> 01:48:09,417
<i>And just get back on the road again</i>

2072
01:48:09,501 --> 01:48:16,049
<i>'Cause I know we've come so far
But we've got so far to go</i>

2073
01:48:16,133 --> 01:48:18,218
<i>I know the road seems long</i>

2074
01:48:18,302 --> 01:48:20,971
<i>But it won't be long
Till it's time to go</i>

2075
01:48:21,055 --> 01:48:27,604
<i>So, most days, we'll take it fast
And some nights, we'll take it slow</i>

2076
01:48:27,687 --> 01:48:29,814
<i>I know we've come so far</i>

2077
01:48:29,898 --> 01:48:34,653
<i>But, baby, baby
We've got so far to go</i>

2078
01:48:34,736 --> 01:48:37,322
<i>Oh, yeah, baby</i>

2079
01:48:37,406 --> 01:48:38,782
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

2080
01:48:38,866 --> 01:48:41,452
<i>Hey, old friend
Come along for the ride</i>

2081
01:48:41,535 --> 01:48:44,455
<i>There's plenty of room so jump inside</i>

2082
01:48:44,538 --> 01:48:47,166
<i>The highway's bumpy
Every now and then</i>

2083
01:48:47,250 --> 01:48:50,378
<i>But it's so much better
Than where I've been</i>

2084
01:48:50,461 --> 01:48:53,006
<i>Just keep moving at your own speed</i>

2085
01:48:53,089 --> 01:48:56,301
<i>Your heart is all the compass
You'll ever need</i>

2086
01:48:56,384 --> 01:48:58,845
<i>Let's keep cruising the road we're on</i>

2087
01:48:58,929 --> 01:49:01,306
<i>'Cause the rear-view mirror
Only shows what's</i>

2088
01:49:01,390 --> 01:49:03,601
<i>Gone, gone, gone</i>

2089
01:49:03,684 --> 01:49:06,479
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

2090
01:49:06,562 --> 01:49:10,191
<i>Got so far to go</i>

2091
01:49:10,274 --> 01:49:12,318
<i>Yeah</i>

2092
01:49:13,903 --> 01:49:15,155
<i>It's so clear</i>

2093
01:49:15,238 --> 01:49:19,368
<i>- Every year we get stronger
- Stronger</i>

2094
01:49:19,451 --> 01:49:20,953
<i>So shine that light</i>

2095
01:49:21,036 --> 01:49:22,287
<i>Take my hand</i>

2096
01:49:22,371 --> 01:49:24,999
<i>Let's dance into the promised land</i>

2097
01:49:25,082 --> 01:49:31,672
<i>'Cause I know we've come so far
But we've got so far to go</i>

2098
01:49:31,756 --> 01:49:33,800
<i>I know the road seems long</i>

2099
01:49:33,883 --> 01:49:36,553
<i>But it won't be long
Till it's time to go</i>

2100
01:49:36,636 --> 01:49:43,185
<i>So, most days, we'll take it fast
But some nights, we'll take it slow</i>

2101
01:49:43,268 --> 01:49:45,312
<i>I know we've come so far</i>

2102
01:49:45,395 --> 01:49:50,109
<i>But, baby, baby
We've got so far to go</i>

2103
01:49:50,192 --> 01:49:52,486
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

2104
01:49:52,570 --> 01:49:55,740
<i>- Yeah, yeah
- Welcome to the '60s</i>

2105
01:49:55,823 --> 01:50:00,495
<i>- Stop!
- Stop telling me what to do</i>

2106
01:50:00,578 --> 01:50:05,292
<i>- Don't!
- Don't treat me like a child of two</i>

2107
01:50:05,375 --> 01:50:10,089
<i>- No!
- I know that you want what's best</i>

2108
01:50:10,172 --> 01:50:12,842
<i>- Please!
- But, Mother, please</i>

2109
01:50:12,925 --> 01:50:17,180
<i>Give it a rest!</i>

2110
01:50:18,848 --> 01:50:22,143
<i>Stop! Don't! No! Please!</i>

2111
01:50:22,227 --> 01:50:25,522
<i>Stop! Don't! No! Please!</i>

2112
01:50:25,605 --> 01:50:28,609
<i>Stop! Don't! No! Please!</i>

2113
01:50:28,692 --> 01:50:30,944
<i>Mama, I'm a big girl now</i>

2114
01:50:31,987 --> 01:50:35,241
<i>Once upon a time
When I was just a kid</i>

2115
01:50:35,324 --> 01:50:38,744
<i>You never let me do
Just what the older kids did</i>

2116
01:50:38,828 --> 01:50:41,956
<i>But lose that laundry list
Of what you won't allow</i>

2117
01:50:42,040 --> 01:50:44,542
<i>'Cause, Mama, I'm a big girl now</i>

2118
01:50:45,752 --> 01:50:48,922
<i>Once upon a time
I played with childhood toys</i>

2119
01:50:49,006 --> 01:50:52,384
<i>But now I'd rather play around
With older boys</i>

2120
01:50:52,468 --> 01:50:55,763
<i>So, if I get a hickey
Please don't have a cow</i>

2121
01:50:55,846 --> 01:50:58,015
<i>'Cause, Mama, I'm a big girl now</i>

2122
01:50:59,267 --> 01:51:02,103
<i>Ma, I gotta tell you
That without a doubt</i>

2123
01:51:02,186 --> 01:51:06,107
<i>I get my best dancing lessons
From you</i>

2124
01:51:06,191 --> 01:51:08,985
<i>You're the one who taught me
How to twist and shout</i>

2125
01:51:09,069 --> 01:51:13,240
<i>Because you shout non-stop
And you're so twisted, too!</i>

2126
01:51:13,323 --> 01:51:14,741
<i>Whoa-oh-oh</i>

2127
01:51:14,825 --> 01:51:17,870
<i>Once I used to fidget
'Cause I just sat home</i>

2128
01:51:17,953 --> 01:51:21,415
<i>But now I'm just like Gidget
And I gotta get to Rome!</i>

2129
01:51:21,499 --> 01:51:23,501
<i>- So say, "Arrivederci!"
- "Toodle-oo!"</i>

2130
01:51:23,584 --> 01:51:24,627
<i>And, "Ciao!"</i>

2131
01:51:24,711 --> 01:51:27,088
<i>'Cause, Mama, I'm a big girl now</i>

2132
01:51:27,755 --> 01:51:31,885
<i>Oh, stop! Don't! No! Please!</i>

2133
01:51:31,968 --> 01:51:35,430
<i>Stop! Don't! No! Please!</i>

2134
01:51:35,514 --> 01:51:38,475
<i>Stop! Don't! No! Please!</i>

2135
01:51:38,559 --> 01:51:40,477
<i>Mama, I'm a big girl now</i>

2136
01:51:40,561 --> 01:51:41,896
<i>Hey, Mama, say, Mama</i>

2137
01:51:41,979 --> 01:51:45,191
<i>Once upon a time
I was a shy young thing</i>

2138
01:51:45,274 --> 01:51:48,570
<i>Could barely walk and talk
So much as dance and sing</i>

2139
01:51:48,653 --> 01:51:51,906
<i>But let me hit that stage
I wanna take my bow</i>

2140
01:51:51,990 --> 01:51:54,075
<i>'Cause, Mama, I'm a big girl now</i>

2141
01:51:54,201 --> 01:51:55,535
<i>Whoa-oh-oh</i>

2142
01:51:55,619 --> 01:51:58,831
<i>Once upon a time
I used to dress up Ken</i>

2143
01:51:58,914 --> 01:52:02,209
<i>But now that I'm a woman
I like bigger men</i>

2144
01:52:02,293 --> 01:52:05,504
<i>And I don't need a Barbie doll
To show me how</i>

2145
01:52:05,588 --> 01:52:07,840
<i>'Cause, Mama, I'm a big girl now</i>

2146
01:52:07,924 --> 01:52:09,050
<i>Ooh, ooh, ah</i>

2147
01:52:09,133 --> 01:52:12,011
<i>Ma, you always taught me
What was right from wrong</i>

2148
01:52:12,095 --> 01:52:15,849
<i>And now I just wanna give it a try</i>

2149
01:52:15,932 --> 01:52:19,102
<i>Mama, I've been in the nest
For far too long</i>

2150
01:52:19,186 --> 01:52:23,023
<i>So please give a push
And, Mama, watch me fly</i>

2151
01:52:23,107 --> 01:52:26,277
<i>- Watch me fly
- Show off</i>

2152
01:52:26,360 --> 01:52:29,488
<i>Someday I will meet
A man you won't condemn</i>

2153
01:52:29,572 --> 01:52:32,659
<i>And we will have some kids
And you can torture them</i>

2154
01:52:32,784 --> 01:52:36,204
<i>But let me be a star
Before I take that vow</i>

2155
01:52:36,287 --> 01:52:38,415
<i>'Cause, Mama, I'm a big girl now</i>

2156
01:52:38,498 --> 01:52:39,875
<i>Whoa-oh-oh</i>

2157
01:52:39,958 --> 01:52:41,752
<i>Mama, I'm a big girl now</i>

2158
01:52:41,835 --> 01:52:43,253
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>

2159
01:52:43,337 --> 01:52:46,715
<i>Mama, I'm a big girl</i>

2160
01:52:46,799 --> 01:52:48,759
<i>Oh, such a big, big girl!</i>

2161
01:52:48,843 --> 01:52:52,305
<i>I'm a big girl now</i>

2162
01:52:52,388 --> 01:52:55,808
<i>Whoa-oh-oh</i>

2163
01:52:55,892 --> 01:52:59,187
<i>Whoa-oh-oh</i>

2164
01:52:59,270 --> 01:53:02,357
<i>Please, Mama, I'm a big girl now</i>

2165
01:53:04,860 --> 01:53:08,364
<i>They came from way far out
In outer space</i>

2166
01:53:08,447 --> 01:53:11,450
<i>She's hard to miss
And so they landed on her face</i>

2167
01:53:11,534 --> 01:53:13,536
<i>She's got cooties</i>

2168
01:53:13,619 --> 01:53:15,163
<i>They've found a place to nest</i>

2169
01:53:15,246 --> 01:53:16,706
<i>- She's got cooties
- Cooties</i>

2170
01:53:16,789 --> 01:53:19,250
<i>If I were her, I'd be depressed</i>

2171
01:53:19,334 --> 01:53:22,921
<i>Long tailed, sharp nailed
Fuzzy legs, laying eggs</i>

2172
01:53:23,630 --> 01:53:26,049
<i>Oh, no, get them</i>

2173
01:53:26,884 --> 01:53:30,429
<i>In science class
She's like a walking show-and-tell</i>

2174
01:53:30,512 --> 01:53:33,349
<i>Her pet skunk ran away
'Cause it couldn't take the smell</i>

2175
01:53:33,432 --> 01:53:34,934
<i>- She's got cooties
- Cooties</i>

2176
01:53:35,017 --> 01:53:37,270
<i>Nobody wants to sit by her</i>

2177
01:53:37,353 --> 01:53:41,191
<i>No, don't need a coat
'Cause she's got fur</i>

2178
01:53:41,274 --> 01:53:43,026
<i>Circle, circle, dot, dot, dot</i>

2179
01:53:43,109 --> 01:53:45,320
<i>Glad I got my cootie shot</i>

2180
01:53:46,738 --> 01:53:48,573
<i>Come on, boys, let's stamp them out</i>

2181
01:53:50,951 --> 01:53:52,202
<i>Cootie, cootie</i>

2182
01:53:52,286 --> 01:53:53,787
<i>Come on, boys</i>

2183
01:53:54,580 --> 01:53:55,873

<i>Come on, boys</i>

2186
01:54:01,379 --> 01:54:04,382
<i>- Whoa, no, no, no
- She's got cooties</i>

2187
01:54:04,466 --> 01:54:07,302
<i>- She's just as friendly as can be
- She's got cooties</i>

2188
01:54:07,385 --> 01:54:11,515
<i>- She shows them cootie hospitality
- She's got cooties</i>

2189
01:54:11,598 --> 01:54:15,227
<i>- She's like a living Twilight Zone
- She's got cooties</i>

2190
01:54:15,311 --> 01:54:17,188
<i>Can you get Rod Sterling
on the phone?</i>

2191
01:54:17,897 --> 01:54:21,526
<i>Black, white, red, green
Every colour in between</i>

2192
01:54:21,609 --> 01:54:23,111
<i>Dresses like a circus clown</i>

2193
01:54:23,194 --> 01:54:25,196
ought to

2194
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:26,865
<i>Grew up in a cootie zoo</i>

2195
01:54:26,948 --> 01:54:30,076
<i>I bet her two-ton Mama's
Got them, too!</i>

2196

2205
01:54:58,649 --> 01:55:01,402

To let her freak flag fly</i>
