1
00:00:42,286 --> 00:00:45,156
We can't hold out much longer, sir!

2
00:01:13,249 --> 00:01:15,809
General Hummel, you've gotta get us outta here now!

3
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:18,550
I won't let you down. I won't let you down, son.

4
00:01:24,431 --> 00:01:28,731
Goddamn it, sir! How long do we have to wait? I've lost 15 men already!

5
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:32,501
Sir, they're lightin' us up like a firestorm!

6
00:01:32,572 --> 00:01:34,872
This is General Hummel. You gotta get my men outta there!

7
00:01:34,942 --> 00:01:37,502
We don't have clearance to go behind enemy lines, sir.

8
00:01:41,383 --> 00:01:43,353
They're not coming for us, are they, sir?

9
00:01:53,335 --> 00:01:57,235
Congressman Weaver and esteemed members of the Special Armed Services Committee.

10
00:01:58,005 --> 00:02:01,705
I come before you to protest a grave injustice.

11
00:02:15,027 --> 00:02:17,117
It has to stop.

12
00:02:59,543 --> 00:03:03,713
I miss you so much.

13
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:15,655
There's something I've gotta do, Barb.

14
00:03:15,725 --> 00:03:18,595
Something I couldn't do while you were here.

15
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:23,565
I tried. You know I tried everything.

16
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:27,936
And I still don't have their attention.

17
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:31,877
Let's hope this elevates their thinking.

18
00:03:31,947 --> 00:03:34,377
But whatever happens...

19
00:03:35,948 --> 00:03:39,008
please don't think less of me.

20
00:04:21,764 --> 00:04:22,474
Marine.

21
00:04:22,504 --> 00:04:26,564
Inform the garrison C.O that General Hummel's coming on board with a security inspection team.

22
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:30,404
Yes, sir. Sir, it's an honor having you, sir.

23
00:05:19,901 --> 00:05:25,731
I got the access card. We've got 30 minutes 'til those darts wear off.

24
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,932
Move it!

25
00:05:30,842 --> 00:05:33,642
The access card, sir.

26
00:05:34,853 --> 00:05:38,283
Let's do it.

27
00:05:41,494 --> 00:05:44,424
2400 magazine check.

28
00:05:59,376 --> 00:06:02,636
-Man, it's wet out there!  -Check me through, will ya?

29
00:06:12,428 --> 00:06:14,988
Clear!

30
00:06:41,321 --> 00:06:45,221
-I want 16, Major!  -Move it!

31
00:07:10,355 --> 00:07:14,085
Evac! Seal the door!

32
00:07:14,155 --> 00:07:15,355
-No!  -Come on, man!  Seal it!

33
00:07:15,426 --> 00:07:18,266
-No!  -Seal it!

34
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:23,896
Let me outta here! Oh, God! Let me outta here! Oh, God!

35
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:26,097
Let me out! Let me out!

36
00:07:26,177 --> 00:07:30,267
Clear out. Get outta here!

37
00:07:36,588 --> 00:07:39,948
Sorry.

38
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,629
Let's move out.

39
00:08:04,282 --> 00:08:09,652
-That'll be five dollars, Isherwood.  -You suck.

40
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:19,193
You guys have too much time on your hands.

41
00:08:19,264 --> 00:08:23,264
Yes! She's here! Bring it to me now. Thank you, Phil!

42
00:08:23,334 --> 00:08:26,634
What's that? Why'd you get it sent here?

43
00:08:26,705 --> 00:08:30,835
Carla wouldn't approve. She thinks it's dumb to spend $600 on an L.P.

44
00:08:30,915 --> 00:08:35,245
Carla's right. Why don't you just spend $13 on a CD, man?

45
00:08:35,316 --> 00:08:37,516
First of all, it's because I'm a Beatlemaniac.

46
00:08:37,586 --> 00:08:40,026
And second, these sound better.

47
00:08:40,927 --> 00:08:45,187
Could be serious. Could be sarin gas.

48
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:50,397
A dog out of JFK caught a whiff of something in this package...

49
00:08:50,468 --> 00:08:52,398
postmarked to a Bosnian refugee camp.

50
00:08:52,468 --> 00:08:55,748
It could be detergent, or it could be sarin gas.

51
00:08:55,758 --> 00:08:57,338
Bosnian refugee camp?

52
00:08:57,349 --> 00:08:59,019
Half a million Serbians reside in the U.S., Marvin.

53
00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:00,209
Serbians don't like Bosnians.

54
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:03,039
You guys wanna get suited up?

55
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:09,820
-You bring the cockroaches?  -Got 'em.

56
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:12,020
We have air lock, Stanley. You're all set to go.

57
00:09:16,231 --> 00:09:20,291
October 1, 0900 hours.

58
00:09:20,302 --> 00:09:24,822
Agent Stanley Goodspeed, Agent/Trainee Marvin Isherwood...

59
00:09:24,832 --> 00:09:26,872
initiating exam of wooden crate.

60
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:29,652
Suspicion of sarin gas inside.

61
00:09:29,663 --> 00:09:33,043
-Marvin, sarin is a...  -G.B. Aerosol.

62
00:09:33,113 --> 00:09:34,773
That is correct.

63
00:09:34,853 --> 00:09:37,113
Now, let's see. We have some dirty magazines.

64
00:09:37,184 --> 00:09:39,184
Stone Age Cave Girls in the Raw.

65
00:09:39,254 --> 00:09:43,384
Kinky. And, uh... Not a good sign.

66
00:09:43,495 --> 00:09:48,325
Hello, little baby doll. Lookit, Stan.

67
00:09:48,335 --> 00:09:50,965
-Hi there, Stanley.  -Marvin!  -Marvin, don't!

68
00:09:51,036 --> 00:09:55,376
-Hi, Stan.  -Shit! Move back! Move back!

69
00:09:56,546 --> 00:09:58,816
I want the exhaust.

70
00:09:58,867 --> 00:10:01,647
Hang on, guys. We'll have that room clear in 50 seconds! You're gonna be okay.

71
00:10:01,717 --> 00:10:04,047
Jesus Christ!

72
00:10:05,487 --> 00:10:08,817
Okay, I've got some bad news and some really bad news.

73
00:10:08,888 --> 00:10:12,328
The bad news is that the gas is corrosive and it's eating our suits.

74
00:10:12,398 --> 00:10:13,618
It's all over my hand, man!

75
00:10:13,698 --> 00:10:14,958
The really bad news...

76
00:10:15,069 --> 00:10:19,829
is there's enough C-4 explosive and poison gas to blow the whole chamber...

77
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,339
and kill everybody in the building.

78
00:10:21,349 --> 00:10:24,009
Detonation too heavy.  -Everybody, out of the room now!

79
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,010
Seal us inside.

80
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,920
Where are the sprinklers, Lonner?

81
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:33,920
The acid's eating my su...It's eating my fucking suit! All right?

82
00:10:33,951 --> 00:10:34,941
Shit!

83
00:10:35,591 --> 00:10:37,221
Just wash us off!

84
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:38,981
Where are my sprinklers?

85
00:10:39,092 --> 00:10:40,952
We're working on it. It's coming. It's just a flow problem.

86
00:10:41,022 --> 00:10:42,222
Well, that's a pretty big friggin' problem, Lonner.

87
00:10:42,262 --> 00:10:43,092
Fix it now!

88
00:10:43,732 --> 00:10:45,882
We're working on it! How much time do you have on that detonator?

89
00:10:45,893 --> 00:10:46,563
A minute ten.

90
00:10:46,723 --> 00:10:47,333
Look at this!

91
00:10:47,403 --> 00:10:49,433
We're gonna have the room clear.

92
00:10:49,503 --> 00:10:50,923
Tell 'em to take the atropine, now!

93
00:10:51,003 --> 00:10:51,993
The atropine, Isherwood.

94
00:10:52,643 --> 00:10:52,823
What?

95
00:10:52,923 --> 00:10:55,163
Where's my water, Lonner? One minute!

96
00:10:55,174 --> 00:10:57,024
Marvin, the atropine, now!

97
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:59,744
Inject it in your heart before your suit melts.

98
00:10:59,884 --> 00:11:01,874
Shit!

99
00:11:01,885 --> 00:11:04,315
Make him take his dose.

100
00:11:04,385 --> 00:11:05,775
Where's that water?

101
00:11:05,825 --> 00:11:07,185
Get that away from me!

102
00:11:07,855 --> 00:11:11,385
Come on, Phil, fix it for Christ's sake!

103
00:11:11,466 --> 00:11:13,526
Take the atropine now, Stan, for Christ's sake!

104
00:11:13,596 --> 00:11:14,616
We're fucked.

105
00:11:14,936 --> 00:11:16,926
The poison's mixing.

106
00:11:16,996 --> 00:11:20,866
What the fuck are you waiting for, Stanley? You take the fucking needle now!

107
00:11:20,937 --> 00:11:23,597
-Fuck! Shit! Oh, fuck, shit!  -Forty seconds!

108
00:11:23,607 --> 00:11:27,097
If that suit melts...If you die, we all die!

109
00:11:27,178 --> 00:11:29,738
Inject your heart and then diffuse the bomb!

110
00:11:29,818 --> 00:11:30,548
Come on, just do it, Stan!

111
00:11:30,608 --> 00:11:32,448
Shit! What if I miss my heart? I can't see shit!

112
00:11:32,548 --> 00:11:33,878
Do it now!

113
00:11:33,949 --> 00:11:37,589
Look how big this is. You want me to stick this into my heart?

114
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:39,529
Are you fucking nuts?

115
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:41,049
The sprinkler's coming! It's coming!

116
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,860
Okay, here we go, man!

117
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,560
Sprinkler activated.

118
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,601
How much time left?

119
00:11:50,671 --> 00:11:53,001
Twenty seconds!

120
00:11:53,841 --> 00:11:56,071
We're not gonna make it.

121
00:11:56,542 --> 00:11:59,372
Fifteen.

122
00:12:01,682 --> 00:12:04,122
Oh, come on.

123
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:06,523
Clear!

124
00:12:08,023 --> 00:12:11,113
Get me the fuck out of this gas chamber!

125
00:12:11,123 --> 00:12:14,623
I almost stabbed myself in the heart with this thing.

126
00:12:16,704 --> 00:12:19,794
-Stan?  -Hey, darlin'.

127
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,365
Hi, baby.

128
00:12:21,435 --> 00:12:26,805
Here inside where I hide with my loneliness.

129
00:12:26,815 --> 00:12:29,435
I had such an interesting day today.

130
00:12:29,446 --> 00:12:31,916
Yeah, I had kind of an interesting day myself.

131
00:12:32,716 --> 00:12:35,086
Oh, okay, you go first.

132
00:12:35,156 --> 00:12:39,646
Oh, just some terrorists decided to send a little care package, box of goodies...

133
00:12:39,727 --> 00:12:43,507
which had to be neutralized before blowing up the office.

134
00:12:43,518 --> 00:12:45,548
So I took the rest of the day off.

135
00:12:45,558 --> 00:12:48,638
Glass of wine, little guitar. Just relaxing.

136
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:54,228
-I mean it, honey. The world is being Fed-Ex'd to hell on a handcart.

137
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:57,409
I really believe that anyone who's even thinking about having a child in this world...

138
00:12:57,479 --> 00:13:00,399
is coldly considering an act of cruelty.

139
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:03,990
I know, I'm rambling, I'm complaining. I'm sorry.

140
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,340
What's your news, baby?

141
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,820
I'm pregnant.

142
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:10,181
I'm sorry?

143
00:13:10,191 --> 00:13:13,761
I'm pregnant.

144
00:13:15,032 --> 00:13:16,142
Really?

145
00:13:16,202 --> 00:13:17,222
Yeah.

146
00:13:17,902 --> 00:13:19,542
Wow!

147
00:13:19,592 --> 00:13:21,002
Is that all you're gonna say, is "wow"?

148
00:13:21,072 --> 00:13:22,542
You're pregnant?

149
00:13:22,573 --> 00:13:23,563
Three weeks.

150
00:13:23,643 --> 00:13:26,473
How do you know? I mean, h-how do you know?

151
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:33,213
Blue! Just turned blue so I went to the doctor.

152
00:13:33,284 --> 00:13:34,994
Well, you didn't mean what you just said, did you?

153
00:13:35,054 --> 00:13:35,884
When?

154
00:13:36,424 --> 00:13:38,514
Uh, just right now when you were talking about bringing a child into the world...

155
00:13:38,595 --> 00:13:40,715
and having it be an act of cruelty.

156
00:13:40,725 --> 00:13:42,415
I meant it at the time.

157
00:13:42,465 --> 00:13:45,455
Stanley, at the time? You said it seven and a half seconds ago.

158
00:13:45,705 --> 00:13:48,125
Well, gosh!

159
00:13:48,136 --> 00:13:51,506
Kind of a lot's happened since then. Look, we're not even married.

160
00:13:51,576 --> 00:13:54,166
I know. It's funny you should mention that.

161
00:13:54,207 --> 00:13:55,267
It's funny?

162
00:13:55,977 --> 00:13:59,837
-Do you love me?  -Of course I love you.

163
00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:02,047
Good.

164
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:06,078
Will you marry me?

165
00:14:06,128 --> 00:14:08,958
Whoa! Whoa! Wai... Hey, Marriage Police, pull over!

166
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:12,698
Come on, Stanley. I'm proposing to you right now.

167
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:26,380
The Rock is the most famous and was the most feared prison ever built.

168
00:14:26,451 --> 00:14:28,941
Is it really true that there's never been an escape?

169
00:14:29,021 --> 00:14:33,251
Ah, that's true. From 1936 until '63 when the prison closed...

170
00:14:33,322 --> 00:14:35,152
there were 14 attempts.

171
00:14:35,162 --> 00:14:40,922
No one is believed to have made it to shore, alive at least.

172
00:14:40,993 --> 00:14:44,373
No, uh, h-h-hey, hey, fellas. I'm sorry, but tourists are not allowed back here.

173
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,723
I don't really give a shit! Do you give a shit?

174
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:47,483
Come here, fruity.

175
00:14:47,533 --> 00:14:48,663
Move!

176
00:14:49,344 --> 00:14:53,244
-Hey, girls? Hi. You all havin' a good time?  -Yeah.

177
00:14:53,314 --> 00:14:53,964
Will you do something for me?

178
00:14:54,014 --> 00:14:56,034
It's really, it's really important.

179
00:14:56,244 --> 00:15:01,254
I need you to tell your teacher that you need to get back on the boat and go home right now.

180
00:15:01,265 --> 00:15:03,645
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Broadway!

181
00:15:03,725 --> 00:15:05,745
This cell block housed...

182
00:15:05,826 --> 00:15:08,986
the most awesome scum in America.

183
00:15:08,996 --> 00:15:12,126
Ladies and gentlemen, I, Ranger Bob...

184
00:15:12,196 --> 00:15:15,016
cordially invite you to become inmates of Alcatraz...

185
00:15:15,067 --> 00:15:16,897
temporarily, of course.

186
00:15:19,107 --> 00:15:22,007
On the line!

187
00:15:23,178 --> 00:15:26,068
Pretty tight quarters, aren't they, huh?

188
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:31,748
Like being a caged animal. Spend a couple of years in there...

189
00:15:31,819 --> 00:15:32,869
What's the matter, fellas? Something wrong with the tour?

190
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:35,089
The tour's over, Bob.

191
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:44,630
What kind of fucked-up tour is this?

192
00:15:57,482 --> 00:16:00,692
General Hummel, Captains Frye and Darrow reporting, sir.

193
00:16:00,703 --> 00:16:02,673
Welcome to The Rock, gentlemen.

194
00:16:02,723 --> 00:16:05,223
Land the choppers on the back side and deploy as planned.

195
00:16:05,293 --> 00:16:07,843
-Aye, aye, sir.  -Aye, aye, sir. Move out!

196
00:16:07,854 --> 00:16:09,754
I'm not allowed to carry a gun.

197
00:16:09,834 --> 00:16:12,054
Oh, you're not allowed to carry a gun? I got a goddamned gun.

198
00:16:12,064 --> 00:16:14,984
If I'd have known this was gonna happen, I'd have brought my motherfuckin' gun!

199
00:16:15,035 --> 00:16:16,465
Help!

200
00:16:18,775 --> 00:16:20,875
All right, gentlemen, this'll be our new home.

201
00:16:20,905 --> 00:16:22,995
Tom, I want my command center right here.

202
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:33,257
-I want Coms up.  -Roger that, sir.

203
00:16:33,267 --> 00:16:37,727
Put the satellite over there. I wanna be up at 1600.

204
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:40,787
Let's move it.

205
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:50,379
Systems up.

206
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:53,399
Possible penetration point in the shower room.

207
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:54,649
We're setting anti-intrusion.

208
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,080
I brought a personal touch, sir.

209
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,000
It's an anti-motion trembler device.

210
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,610
It's custom-made.

211
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:03,600
Nobody knows about it and nobody expects it.

212
00:17:03,611 --> 00:17:04,451
What's it do?

213
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:06,551
We head-fake 'em with the laser beam.

214
00:17:06,691 --> 00:17:11,251
And then if they disturb Mr. Backup here, we own 'em.

215
00:17:24,813 --> 00:17:30,243
Ladies and gentlemen, you're being detained against your will. For that, I apologize.

216
00:17:30,254 --> 00:17:33,114
It is not our intention in any way to harm you.

217
00:17:33,194 --> 00:17:36,594
You will not be detained one minute longer than is necessary for us to complete our mission.

218
00:17:42,406 --> 00:17:45,456
Attention on deck!

219
00:17:45,536 --> 00:17:48,836
Stand easy, men.

220
00:17:48,846 --> 00:17:54,146
Make no mistake about it, gentlemen, we are now in harm's way.

221
00:17:54,217 --> 00:17:58,847
For Major Baxter and I, this is the last campaign in a career datin' back to Tet '68.

222
00:18:00,318 --> 00:18:03,208
Likewise for Captain Hendrix, Gunnery Sergeant Crisp...

223
00:18:03,218 --> 00:18:06,548
who cut their teeth under my command in Desert Storm.

224
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,849
Captain Frye, Captain Darrow, this is my first operational situation with you and your men.

225
00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:13,329
And I have to say, thus far your conduct reflects your reputations.

226
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,440
-Thank you, General.  -Thank you, sir.

227
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:19,120
We have achieved our position through poise, precision and audacity.

228
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,210
To this we must now add resolve.

229
00:18:21,221 --> 00:18:24,601
We'll be branded as traitors, the gravest capital crime...

230
00:18:24,611 --> 00:18:26,841
Punishable by death.

231
00:18:27,051 --> 00:18:29,641
A couple hundred years ago...

232
00:18:29,652 --> 00:18:32,862
a few guys named Washington, Jefferson and Adams...

233
00:18:32,892 --> 00:18:36,222
were branded as traitors by the British.

234
00:18:36,293 --> 00:18:39,133
And now they're called patriots.

235
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:41,223
In time, so shall we.

236
00:18:42,433 --> 00:18:44,803
God willing, in less than 48 hours...

237
00:18:44,814 --> 00:18:50,734
you will evacuate this island in gunships under cover of hostages and V.X. Gas warheads.

238
00:18:50,814 --> 00:18:54,724
Your destination: A non-extradition treaty country.

239
00:18:54,735 --> 00:18:58,975
You will each be paid a fee of $1 million for services rendered.

240
00:18:58,985 --> 00:19:03,105
But you can never again set foot on your native soil.

241
00:19:03,116 --> 00:19:04,866
Can you live with that?

242
00:19:04,896 --> 00:19:06,226
Yes, sir!

243
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,656
The men of Marine Force Recon...

244
00:19:08,737 --> 00:19:12,357
are selected to carry out illegal operations throughout the world.

245
00:19:13,837 --> 00:19:16,867
When they don't come home...

246
00:19:16,938 --> 00:19:20,708
their families are told fairy tales about what happened to them...

247
00:19:20,778 --> 00:19:22,618
and denied compensation.

248
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:26,198
Well, I have choked on these lies my entire career!

249
00:19:26,209 --> 00:19:29,149
Well, here and now the lies stop!

250
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:38,650
God be with all of you. Man your positions, men.

251
00:19:42,691 --> 00:19:44,951
This is FBI Director Womack.

252
00:19:45,021 --> 00:19:48,081
Director, be advised.

253
00:19:48,092 --> 00:19:51,422
Eighty-one, I say again,

254
00:19:51,502 --> 00:19:53,462
81 civilians are under my control as of this moment.

255
00:19:53,472 --> 00:19:55,442
81 civilians are under my control as of this moment.

256
00:19:55,513 --> 00:19:59,783
You are to take measures to assure this remains a need-to-know classified fact.

257
00:19:59,853 --> 00:20:01,293
Who is this?

258
00:20:01,353 --> 00:20:04,203
Mr. Director, you have a very serious problem.

259
00:20:04,214 --> 00:20:06,954
A battery of V.X. Gas rockets is presently deployed...

260
00:20:07,034 --> 00:20:11,334
to deliver a highly lethal strike on the population of the San Francisco Bay area.

261
00:20:11,405 --> 00:20:13,675
I will call again at 0100 hours to state my demands.

262
00:20:13,705 --> 00:20:15,035
I want to know who I'm talking to.

263
00:20:15,345 --> 00:20:20,535
This is Brigadier General Francis X. Hummel, United States Marine Corps, from Alcatraz.

264
00:20:20,546 --> 00:20:22,276
Out!

265
00:20:23,146 --> 00:20:24,686
I'll cancel your reservations.

266
00:20:24,716 --> 00:20:26,216
Get the Pentagon.

267
00:20:26,227 --> 00:20:31,087
And call the San Francisco office. It seems Alcatraz was just reopened.

268
00:20:32,387 --> 00:20:35,517
Last night General Hummel, using brutal but nonlethal force...

269
00:20:35,598 --> 00:20:40,428
under the guise of a security exercise, walked off with 15 V.X. Poison gas rockets.

270
00:20:40,438 --> 00:20:43,068
He lost one of his own men in the process.

271
00:20:43,199 --> 00:20:46,829
That's General Hummel in Vietnam. I think he was a major at the time.

272
00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:48,579
Three tours in...

273
00:20:48,609 --> 00:20:50,539
Vietnam, Panama, Grenada, Desert Storm.

274
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,110
Three Purple Hearts, two Silver Stars...

275
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,950
and the Congressional Medal of...

276
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:59,210
Jesus! This man is a hero!

277
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,851
Well, I think "legend" might be a better description, Mr. Sinclair.

278
00:21:01,921 --> 00:21:05,361
Well, now we can add kidnapping and extortion to his list of accolades.

279
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:07,892
Mr. Sinclair, General Hummel is a man of honor.

280
00:21:09,432 --> 00:21:11,192
General, it's him.

281
00:21:13,403 --> 00:21:15,423
Frank, it's Al Kramer.

282
00:21:15,433 --> 00:21:16,953
Hi, Al, how you doin'?

283
00:21:16,963 --> 00:21:19,673
I don't know, Frank. Ah, why don't you tell me.

284
00:21:19,743 --> 00:21:22,903
Got a lot of very, very worried people here, Frank.

285
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:24,354
I'll come straight to the point.

286
00:21:24,364 --> 00:21:28,144
Eight-three Force Reconnaissance Marines have died under my various commands.

287
00:21:28,224 --> 00:21:30,584
Forty-seven in northern Laos and southern China.

288
00:21:30,655 --> 00:21:34,255
Southern China? We never admitted we sent troops into China.

289
00:21:34,265 --> 00:21:36,225
Who is this? Identify yourself.

290
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,315
White House Chief of Staff Hayden Sinclair, General.

291
00:21:39,326 --> 00:21:42,306
How old are you, Chief of Staff Sinclair?

292
00:21:42,336 --> 00:21:43,596
I'm 33.

293
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:48,296
Well, Mr. Sinclair, you've probably got no fucking idea what I'm talking about.

294
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,487
By your ninth birthday, I was runnin' black ops into China...

295
00:21:51,497 --> 00:21:53,907
and my men were responsible f-for over 200 enemy kills.

296
00:21:53,988 --> 00:21:56,848
Al, put some rigging tape over Mr. Sinclair's mouth.

297
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:58,278
He's wasting my time.

298
00:21:58,388 --> 00:22:00,648
Ah, you want to continue, Frank?

299
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:02,719
Remember Operation Desert Storm?

300
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:06,589
Those surgical hits made by our smart bombs, covered so well on CNN?

301
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:11,329
It was my men on the ground that made those hits possible by lasing the targets.

302
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,890
Twenty of them were left to rot outside Baghdad after the conflict ended.

303
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,370
No benefits were paid to their families.

304
00:22:18,381 --> 00:22:21,041
No medals conferred.

305
00:22:21,111 --> 00:22:25,521
These men died for their country, and they weren't even given a goddamn military burial.

306
00:22:27,592 --> 00:22:31,682
The situation is unacceptable. You will transfer $100 million...

307
00:22:31,763 --> 00:22:35,623
from the Grand Cayman Red Sea Trading Company account to an account I designate.

308
00:22:35,693 --> 00:22:38,623
From these funds, reparations of $1 million will be paid...

309
00:22:38,633 --> 00:22:41,093
to each of the 83 marines' families.

310
00:22:41,174 --> 00:22:44,694
The rest of the funds I will disperse at my discretion.

311
00:22:45,004 --> 00:22:47,004
Do I make myself clear?

312
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:50,445
Except for the Red Sea Trading Company. What is that?

313
00:22:50,515 --> 00:22:51,135
Identify yourself.

314
00:22:51,185 --> 00:22:53,235
This is FBI Director Womack, General.

315
00:22:53,585 --> 00:22:57,245
It's a slush fund where the Pentagon keeps proceeds from illegal arms sales.

316
00:22:57,326 --> 00:22:59,846
Jesus, Frank! This is classified information.

317
00:22:59,926 --> 00:23:03,166
You alert the media, I launch the gas.

318
00:23:03,177 --> 00:23:05,867
You refuse payment, I launch the gas.

319
00:23:05,877 --> 00:23:10,467
You've got 40 hours, 'til noon day after tomorrow to arrange transfer of the money.

320
00:23:10,538 --> 00:23:14,468
I am aware of your countermeasure. You know and I know it doesn't stand a chance.

321
00:23:14,478 --> 00:23:18,378
Hummel from Alcatraz. Out.

322
00:23:18,449 --> 00:23:23,319
All right. We have to identify the hostages and contact each of their families.

323
00:23:23,379 --> 00:23:27,459
Uh, tell 'em somethin'. Make up a story, and we've got to keep this undercover.

324
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:31,650
If this comes out, the city of San Francisco will be in chaos. I am talking anarchy.

325
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:32,800
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

326
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:35,350
What is the potential casualty rate...

327
00:23:35,401 --> 00:23:40,061
for a single rocket armed with V.X. Poison gas, General Peterson?

328
00:23:40,071 --> 00:23:42,051
Sixty or seventy.

329
00:23:42,102 --> 00:23:43,162
Well, that's, that's not so bad.

330
00:23:43,802 --> 00:23:48,712
Thousand. Seventy thousand dead!

331
00:23:48,782 --> 00:23:53,692
One teaspoon of this hits the floor, it's lethal up to a hundred feet.

332
00:23:53,703 --> 00:23:57,383
One teaspoon of this shit detonated in the atmosphere...

333
00:23:57,454 --> 00:24:00,424
will kill every living organism in an eight-block radius.

334
00:24:00,494 --> 00:24:02,854
Get the point?

335
00:24:02,924 --> 00:24:05,484
Uh, what did Hummel mean by your countermeasure, General?

336
00:24:05,565 --> 00:24:09,765
Standard poison is countered by napalm. It burns it up, consumes it upon detonation.

337
00:24:09,835 --> 00:24:12,205
Now, the problem with V.X. Poison gas is...

338
00:24:12,275 --> 00:24:14,865
that it's designed specifically to withstand napalm.

339
00:24:14,876 --> 00:24:18,276
That's where, uh, thermite plasma comes in. General Peterson?

340
00:24:18,286 --> 00:24:22,446
Thermite plasma incendiary systems can burn hot enough to consume V.X...

341
00:24:22,457 --> 00:24:26,077
but they're still in the test phase; it's not operational.

342
00:24:26,087 --> 00:24:30,417
Hummel knows this. We are dealing with one smart son of a bitch.

343
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:36,498
What's it gonna take to equip a flight of F-18s with thermite plasma...within the next 36 hours?

344
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:37,828
An act of God.

345
00:24:37,869 --> 00:24:38,999
Excuse me?

346
00:24:40,339 --> 00:24:41,859
All right, we can try.

347
00:24:41,869 --> 00:24:45,639
But I strongly urge you to consider the use of this as a secondary initiative.

348
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,700
Then we have to go to our primary initiative. Uh, Admiral?

349
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:52,310
Sir, I'd like to bring in our SEAL ground commander, Commander Anderson.

350
00:24:52,381 --> 00:24:57,121
Mr. Womack, who is your best chemical/biological man?

351
00:24:57,251 --> 00:24:59,731
Oh, that's interesting. Oh, yeah.

352
00:24:59,761 --> 00:25:01,191
That's very compelling.

353
00:25:06,962 --> 00:25:08,002
You like my pigtails?

354
00:25:08,033 --> 00:25:11,203
Oh, yeah, the pigtails are very naughty.

355
00:25:11,213 --> 00:25:18,543
Naughty. Naughty. Just the Amaretto cream with peach sorbet persuasion.

356
00:25:18,614 --> 00:25:19,454
This isn't happening.

357
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:20,714
No, Stan, don't answer it.

358
00:25:21,114 --> 00:25:24,114
-This isn't happening!  -No, just don't answer it. It's okay.

359
00:25:24,125 --> 00:25:27,015
I have to. It's the office, baby. They know I'm home.

360
00:25:27,085 --> 00:25:29,785
How could they possibly know that you're home?

361
00:25:29,795 --> 00:25:32,085
It's the FBI.

362
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:35,656
Stanley!

363
00:25:35,666 --> 00:25:38,996
Goodspeed. Uh, yeah. O-Okay, yeah.

364
00:25:39,006 --> 00:25:41,366
I'll be, I'll be down, yeah, downstairs in ten minutes.

365
00:25:41,377 --> 00:25:44,167
No, you won't.

366
00:25:45,207 --> 00:25:46,767
I have to go to San Francisco.

367
00:25:46,807 --> 00:25:48,337
No, you don't.

368
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:51,958
Stanley, no, you do not have to go to San Francisco.

369
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:53,658
Are you kidding me right now?

370
00:25:53,688 --> 00:25:55,518
You need to stay here and talk to me about things.

371
00:25:55,689 --> 00:25:57,659
I've got to go, baby.

372
00:25:57,689 --> 00:25:59,519
Oh! I am Catholic! Do you realize that?

373
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:04,189
I am pregnant and I am unmarried. And this causes a serious problem for me.

374
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:06,290
I cannot believe you.

375
00:26:15,281 --> 00:26:17,211
No, no.

376
00:26:18,782 --> 00:26:22,682
I love you. I will marry you.

377
00:26:22,752 --> 00:26:25,482
I just didn't plan on this, that's all.

378
00:26:26,493 --> 00:26:28,893
-Come to San Francisco.  -Really?

379
00:26:28,903 --> 00:26:31,453
Yeah, I'm sure it's just a training exercise.

380
00:26:31,463 --> 00:26:34,063
Check into the hotel. Order up some champagne.

381
00:26:34,133 --> 00:26:36,153
-And we'll finish what we started?  -Exactly.

382
00:26:36,234 --> 00:26:37,994
-Baby, you're gonna marry me?  -You know it.

383
00:26:38,074 --> 00:26:40,764
You're gonna marry me!

384
00:26:40,844 --> 00:26:44,674
-Oh, honey, come on. Just a really quick one.  -Oh, oh, I gotta go now.

385
00:26:44,745 --> 00:26:47,835
A nighttime airdrop incursion is out due to the full moon.

386
00:26:47,915 --> 00:26:49,845
Likewise a frontal seaside attack.

387
00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:53,106
If we're compromised and shots are fired, Hummel might launch.

388
00:26:53,116 --> 00:26:56,016
Our only alternative is an attack from within the prison.

389
00:26:56,086 --> 00:26:59,516
We penetrate the island through the tunnels under the prison buildings undetected...

390
00:26:59,527 --> 00:27:02,627
and emerge in its center; that way we can jump the marines from behind.

391
00:27:02,697 --> 00:27:03,697
And if we're lucky...

392
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:05,867
take their rocket positions without a shot fired.

393
00:27:06,038 --> 00:27:09,028
I don't understand. You-you've studied the architectural plans?

394
00:27:09,108 --> 00:27:12,578
They're useless. Alcatraz has been ripped up and rebuilt for years.

395
00:27:12,588 --> 00:27:15,968
-Under there is a maze of shit.  -Well, there's no question, gentlemen.

396
00:27:15,979 --> 00:27:18,739
We need firsthand intelligence of the tunnel systems.

397
00:27:18,819 --> 00:27:19,519
So what about the former warden?

398
00:27:19,549 --> 00:27:21,539
Died in 1979.

399
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:24,410
All the guards we contacted were useless.

400
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:29,480
Um, there is someone who I think can help us.

401
00:27:32,061 --> 00:27:34,251
This is for the sake of national security.

402
00:27:34,261 --> 00:27:38,561
It's the sake of national security that got us here in the first place 33 years ago.

403
00:27:38,642 --> 00:27:41,472
I knew! I knew someday this would come back to bite us.

404
00:27:41,542 --> 00:27:43,552
Forget it! He does not exist.

405
00:27:43,602 --> 00:27:45,362
He does exist!

406
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:47,573
We just chose to forget him for 30 years.

407
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:51,573
-We locked him up and threw away the key.  -Oh, and a lot of goddamn good it did us.

408
00:27:51,583 --> 00:27:53,853
He broke out of two maximum-security prisons.

409
00:27:53,884 --> 00:27:55,104
And if he hits the streets...

410
00:27:55,154 --> 00:27:57,104
He's not gonna hit the streets, Jim.

411
00:27:57,114 --> 00:28:00,624
Thirty years ago he was a highly-trained SAS operative.

412
00:28:00,695 --> 00:28:02,495
He is my age now, for Christ's sake!

413
00:28:02,565 --> 00:28:05,465
I have to get up three times a night to take a piss.

414
00:28:05,535 --> 00:28:08,695
We can't risk letting him out.

415
00:28:08,706 --> 00:28:12,436
He's a professional escape artist.

416
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,880
Neat, neat plane.

417
00:28:48,951 --> 00:28:50,881
Dr. Goodspeed. James Womack.

418
00:28:50,951 --> 00:28:52,971
-A pleasure to meet you, sir.  -Welcome.

419
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,551
You come very highly recommended.

420
00:28:54,621 --> 00:28:58,451
B.A. Columbia; M.A., PhD, Johns Hopkins.

421
00:28:58,462 --> 00:28:59,912
Biochemistry, toxicology.

422
00:28:59,922 --> 00:29:02,562
Well, I'm one of those fortunate people who like my job, sir.

423
00:29:02,572 --> 00:29:05,862
Got my first chemistry set when I was seven. Blew my eyebrows off.

424
00:29:05,933 --> 00:29:08,903
We never saw the cat again. Been into it ever since.

425
00:29:08,973 --> 00:29:10,723
What do you know about V.X. Gas?

426
00:29:10,733 --> 00:29:14,213
Liquid. Failed pesticide discovered by a mistake in 1952.

427
00:29:14,274 --> 00:29:15,804
Uh, actually, it's kind of like champagne that way.

428
00:29:15,884 --> 00:29:17,544
The Franciscan monks thought they were making white wine.

429
00:29:17,614 --> 00:29:19,744
Somehow the bottle carbonated. Voila! Champagne. And then the whole thing just...

430
00:29:19,715 --> 00:29:22,275
The gas, Dr. Goodspeed.

431
00:29:22,355 --> 00:29:24,615
It's very, very horrible, sir.

432
00:29:24,695 --> 00:29:27,095
It's one of those things we wish we could disinvent.

433
00:29:28,596 --> 00:29:30,686
This isn't a "train" exercise, is it?

434
00:29:30,766 --> 00:29:35,226
No, Dr. Goodspeed, it's not a training exercise.

435
00:30:12,781 --> 00:30:14,401
Good morning, Director.

436
00:30:14,482 --> 00:30:17,352
This is Ernest Paxton, agent in charge of the West Coast operation.

437
00:30:17,362 --> 00:30:18,192
Dr. Goodspeed.

438
00:30:18,222 --> 00:30:19,052
Pleasure to meet you.

439
00:30:19,122 --> 00:30:19,882
How do you do, sir?

440
00:30:19,982 --> 00:30:24,132
It's been a fairly interesting day so far. The prisoner's here. Shall we?

441
00:30:24,143 --> 00:30:29,083
Now, my boys, they haven't been able to find a file on this guy. Who is he anyway, sir?

442
00:30:29,163 --> 00:30:32,163
His name is John Mason, a British national...

443
00:30:32,174 --> 00:30:34,874
incarcerated on Alcatraz in 1962...

444
00:30:34,904 --> 00:30:36,894
escaped in '63.

445
00:30:37,205 --> 00:30:39,835
I was under the impression that no one ever escaped Alcatraz, sir.

446
00:30:39,905 --> 00:30:41,675
Paxton, don't argue!

447
00:30:41,685 --> 00:30:46,375
This man has no identity, not in the United States or Great Britain.

448
00:30:46,446 --> 00:30:49,046
He does not exist. Understand?

449
00:30:49,116 --> 00:30:51,386
I want one thing: How he escaped The Rock.

450
00:30:51,456 --> 00:30:54,546
Specifically the route he took through the island's bowels.

451
00:30:54,627 --> 00:30:56,177
The papers are in order, sir.

452
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:58,697
We're prepared to offer him a full pardon.

453
00:30:58,707 --> 00:31:02,107
And Paxton, no strong-arming Mason. I know him too well.

454
00:31:02,118 --> 00:31:05,238
Well, if you know him, then why don't you question him?

455
00:31:05,308 --> 00:31:10,008
No, he'll remember me. I don't want his anger clouding the issue.

456
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:11,539
All right, I'll take care of him.

457
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:24,120
Mr. Mason, I'm Special Agent in Charge, Ernest Paxton.

458
00:31:24,191 --> 00:31:27,561
In charge of what? Fucking me over for another three decades?

459
00:31:27,571 --> 00:31:31,591
I don't know anything about your previous matters. I'm here because...

460
00:31:31,671 --> 00:31:35,071
a special situation exists that we feel you might be able to help us with.

461
00:31:35,142 --> 00:31:36,412
Well, what might that be?

462
00:31:36,422 --> 00:31:38,642
I've been in jail longer than Nelson Mandela.

463
00:31:38,672 --> 00:31:40,972
So maybe you want me to run for president.

464
00:31:41,543 --> 00:31:43,973
-Not exactly.  -Mmm, a pity.

465
00:31:43,983 --> 00:31:46,943
I feel rather like Alcamenes.

466
00:31:47,013 --> 00:31:51,423
-Who?  -Alcamenes. He was imprisoned by his king in ancient Greece.

467
00:31:51,494 --> 00:31:54,034
Like Sir Walter Raleigh. The same fate.

468
00:31:54,094 --> 00:31:55,254
James the First.

469
00:31:55,825 --> 00:31:59,385
Even someone as bright as you must be aware that, uh...

470
00:31:59,465 --> 00:32:01,765
there's a certain pattern emerging here.

471
00:32:01,775 --> 00:32:03,905
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn?

472
00:32:03,966 --> 00:32:07,376
Yeah, I heard of him. Didn't he play hockey for the fuckin' Red Wings?

473
00:32:07,436 --> 00:32:08,516
That's the chap.

474
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:13,406
Get this straight, pops. I don't like you any more than you like me.

475
00:32:13,477 --> 00:32:15,917
But I'm here to make you a legitimate offer.

476
00:32:15,987 --> 00:32:18,217
You wanna hear what I have to say or not?

477
00:32:18,287 --> 00:32:22,987
By all means, dear Paxton. By all means.

478
00:32:23,058 --> 00:32:25,428
We got a problem in a place that I think you know.

479
00:32:25,498 --> 00:32:28,328
There's a hostage situation on Alcatraz.

480
00:32:28,339 --> 00:32:31,929
-Hostage?  -Eighty-one tourists.

481
00:32:31,999 --> 00:32:34,839
The Rock has become a tourist attraction?

482
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:38,510
Why don't we cut the shit, huh? You know The Rock.

483
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,690
You broke out.

484
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,840
Yes, successfully.

485
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:45,000
Yeah. So why don't you do yourself a favor while you're helpin' us?

486
00:32:45,081 --> 00:32:47,981
I mean, it'd be nice to get out of jail while you're still vertical.

487
00:32:48,051 --> 00:32:51,251
Hmm? While you got a little lead left in your pencil.

488
00:32:53,662 --> 00:32:55,752
While I'm considering your offer...

489
00:32:55,832 --> 00:33:00,022
I want a suite in the Fairmont Hotel.

490
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:03,323
You know I'm here to cut you a deal.

491
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:08,103
I am not here to bend over and take it up the ass from you.

492
00:33:08,174 --> 00:33:10,874
Here. Here's a quarter.

493
00:33:14,685 --> 00:33:16,055
Do yourself a favor.

494
00:33:16,085 --> 00:33:18,955
Call your lawyer. You're goin' back to jail.

495
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:26,096
-Y-You're sending him back to jail?  -I'm not sending him anywhere.

496
00:33:26,126 --> 00:33:28,396
I'm just givin' him somethin' to think about.

497
00:33:28,466 --> 00:33:30,266
With all due respect, sir, I don't think we have time...

498
00:33:30,337 --> 00:33:31,697
for him to just sit around and think about it.

499
00:33:31,767 --> 00:33:34,667
-Oh, really?  -No, Goodspeed's right.

500
00:33:34,677 --> 00:33:36,787
-You go talk to him.  -Me?

501
00:33:36,897 --> 00:33:37,297
Yes.

502
00:33:37,377 --> 00:33:39,967
-Sir, I'm not qualified for that.  -You're an FBI agent!

503
00:33:40,048 --> 00:33:43,518
-W-What is your specialty again?  -Chemical weapons.

504
00:33:43,528 --> 00:33:44,978
Don't mention that!

505
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:51,079
-You want me to lie?  -Yeah, lie.

506
00:33:51,959 --> 00:33:55,859
We got less than 24 hours. Give it a shot.

507
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,460
Okay.

508
00:34:06,771 --> 00:34:10,841
I'm an agent with the, uh, uh, F-Federal...

509
00:34:10,912 --> 00:34:13,782
FBI. Uh...

510
00:34:13,852 --> 00:34:15,552
Eh, well, my... I'm Stanley Goodspeed.

511
00:34:15,582 --> 00:34:17,052
But of course you are.

512
00:34:17,693 --> 00:34:20,213
Well, at least he got his name right.

513
00:34:20,293 --> 00:34:21,863
Of course I am. Huh.

514
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,103
And you have an emergency.

515
00:34:24,123 --> 00:34:27,533
That's right.

516
00:34:27,594 --> 00:34:29,304
And you need my help.

517
00:34:29,334 --> 00:34:31,894
Exactly right.

518
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:36,435
-Coffee.  -No, no, I'm fine. Thank you.

519
00:34:36,505 --> 00:34:39,065
Offer me coffee.

520
00:34:39,075 --> 00:34:42,275
Oh, yes! Well, that was, in fact, gonna be my next...

521
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:45,116
Can we get a cup of coffee in here, please?

522
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:49,946
And offer to take these off. Mr. Mason, really.

523
00:34:49,957 --> 00:34:54,257
As a gesture of your good faith.

524
00:34:56,898 --> 00:35:00,798
Prisoner requests to have his handcuffs taken off.

525
00:35:03,008 --> 00:35:05,298
Why don't you go ahead and have his handcuffs taken off, please?

526
00:35:05,379 --> 00:35:08,109
Well, I guess that's one way to go.

527
00:35:10,049 --> 00:35:14,309
This is a pardon and release contract from the Attorney General's office.

528
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:18,450
Now, it makes you a free man provided you cooperate.

529
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,890
So if you'll just, uh, sign...

530
00:35:21,961 --> 00:35:24,831
uh, at, uh, where it says..."Signature"?

531
00:35:24,861 --> 00:35:26,451
That's... Yes. "Signature."

532
00:35:27,402 --> 00:35:32,362
Well, timeo danaos et dona ferentis.

533
00:35:32,442 --> 00:35:35,502
"I fear the Greeks even when they bring gifts."

534
00:35:35,573 --> 00:35:37,733
Oh, an educated man!

535
00:35:37,743 --> 00:35:43,373
That rules out the possibility of you being a field agent.

536
00:35:43,454 --> 00:35:46,354
In point of fact, I am a field agent, Mr. Mason.

537
00:35:46,364 --> 00:35:48,754
-Really?  -Yes.

538
00:35:48,824 --> 00:35:50,664
In which field?

539
00:35:50,695 --> 00:35:51,885
Antiterrorism.

540
00:35:52,595 --> 00:35:56,695
Then you're trained in weaponry, explosives and mortal combat.

541
00:35:57,865 --> 00:36:00,695
Well-trained.

542
00:36:00,766 --> 00:36:03,736
Then it's the Fairmont Hotel.

543
00:36:05,276 --> 00:36:07,276
Okay.

544
00:36:07,347 --> 00:36:11,277
I want a suite, a shower, a shave...

545
00:36:11,347 --> 00:36:13,247
and the feel of a suit.

546
00:36:13,317 --> 00:36:16,547
May I also suggest, uh, a haircut?

547
00:36:16,618 --> 00:36:17,918
Am I out of style?

548
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:19,688
Unless you're a 20-year-old guitarist from Seattle.

549
00:36:20,458 --> 00:36:21,768
It's a grunge thing.

550
00:36:21,798 --> 00:36:23,188
Grunge?

551
00:36:23,329 --> 00:36:26,359
Yeah, well, uh, uh... Okay, thank you very much.

552
00:36:26,429 --> 00:36:29,319
All right. Call the Fairmont. Close the floor if necessary.

553
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:30,739
But I want him sealed off.

554
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:34,160
And he gets two hours max.

555
00:36:48,422 --> 00:36:50,062
Great job, Goodspeed.

556
00:36:50,092 --> 00:36:51,682
Why didn't you throw in a trip to Tahiti while you were at it?

557
00:36:51,762 --> 00:36:53,412
I'll deliver this to the Attorney General.

558
00:36:53,433 --> 00:36:54,693
Uh, no, you'll give it to me. Give it to me, Reynolds.

559
00:36:54,803 --> 00:37:00,633
And take Attorney Reynolds outside. There's a car waiting for you. Thank you.

560
00:37:02,274 --> 00:37:06,534
That's a signed federal document, sir. Isn't that illegal?

561
00:37:06,614 --> 00:37:09,134
You're not acquainted with the full facts, Goodspeed.

562
00:37:09,215 --> 00:37:13,615
With all due respect, sir, I'd like clarification. I gave that man my word.

563
00:37:13,685 --> 00:37:19,055
Damn it! You're on a need-to-know basis, and you don't need to know.

564
00:37:19,126 --> 00:37:21,756
It's, uh, it's, eh, kind of curious, but, uh,

565
00:37:21,766 --> 00:37:27,496
Sir Walter Raleigh, Alcamenes, Solzhenitsyn, they, um, well, they were all wrongfully imprisoned.

566
00:37:35,748 --> 00:37:41,608
Womack! Now, why am I not surprised, you piece of shit!

567
00:37:41,689 --> 00:37:43,979
Eh, peace! Peace!

568
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,830
Hey, we're not home. Leave a message.

569
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:56,060
Hi, darling, it's, uh, it's me.

570
00:37:56,131 --> 00:38:01,791
Uh, listen, don't come to San Francisco. I repeat, do not come to San Francisco.

571
00:38:01,871 --> 00:38:03,431
Stanley, no!

572
00:38:03,511 --> 00:38:04,971
-Carla.  -Like hell I'm not coming!

573
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:07,512
Wait. Car...

574
00:38:10,852 --> 00:38:13,232
Who's Carla?

575
00:38:13,253 --> 00:38:15,683
And why don't you want her to come to San Francisco?

576
00:38:20,794 --> 00:38:24,864
You're on a need-to-know basis, and you don't need to know.

577
00:38:24,934 --> 00:38:27,904
Watch it, he'll bite you.

578
00:38:35,145 --> 00:38:36,515
Good.

579
00:38:36,546 --> 00:38:38,736
Mobile Command is fully operational.

580
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:39,676
Good. Mobile Command is fully operational.

581
00:38:39,746 --> 00:38:41,406
We'll be there in approximately two hours.

582
00:38:41,416 --> 00:38:42,476
I'm not armed, sir.

583
00:38:42,816 --> 00:38:44,456
I am unarmed, sir.

584
00:38:44,487 --> 00:38:46,317
Well, where's your issue?

585
00:38:46,827 --> 00:38:50,387
I left it in my, uh, my sock drawer.

586
00:38:51,668 --> 00:38:52,958
A gun?

587
00:38:52,968 --> 00:38:57,158
For what? You're a chemical freak.

588
00:38:57,238 --> 00:39:01,728
No, I'm a chemical super-freak, actually. But I still need a gun.

589
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:05,009
Give him a goddamn gun.

590
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:10,080
Have you fired one of those things since the Academy?

591
00:39:36,743 --> 00:39:39,213
Uh, uh, room service?

592
00:39:39,284 --> 00:39:43,744
Ah, listen. This is the penthouse. Do you do snacks, drinks? Huh?

593
00:39:43,884 --> 00:39:46,014
Hello!

594
00:39:46,095 --> 00:39:48,425
-You the barber?  -No. Stylist.

595
00:39:48,495 --> 00:39:51,055
Barber.

596
00:39:51,125 --> 00:39:51,965
Just clippers. No scissors.

597
00:39:51,995 --> 00:39:54,625
No scissors? You've got to be kidding me, no scissors!

598
00:39:55,106 --> 00:39:57,406
I mean, did they tell Picasso, "No brush"?

599
00:39:57,416 --> 00:39:59,336
With scissors, this man could kill you.

600
00:39:59,406 --> 00:40:03,956
I can't cut anyone's balls off with a trimmer now, can I?

601
00:40:03,967 --> 00:40:07,377
Why don't we do this outside? Get some sun.

602
00:40:09,618 --> 00:40:13,748
Oh, who did this to you? This is just not right. In fact, it's nasty!

603
00:40:13,818 --> 00:40:15,848
Well, it's a grunge thing.

604
00:40:15,928 --> 00:40:17,918
Well, it's some kind of thing.

605
00:40:17,989 --> 00:40:20,929
Do you think we have time for a sea kelp protein pack and maybe some color?

606
00:40:20,999 --> 00:40:22,719
No.

607
00:40:22,729 --> 00:40:24,999
Okay.

608
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,700
Not very nice, is he?

609
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:29,260
No, he's not.

610
00:40:45,822 --> 00:40:48,722
Hey, somebody ordered it. Can't let it go to waste.

611
00:40:48,793 --> 00:40:51,423
Don't you ever stop eatin'?

612
00:40:51,433 --> 00:40:54,193
Not when it's free.

613
00:40:54,263 --> 00:40:55,393
We're supposed to be on duty.

614
00:40:55,403 --> 00:40:57,003
Hey, don't worry. He's an old man.

615
00:40:57,604 --> 00:41:00,544
The boss is watchin' 'im. Come on. Have...Try some of this lobster.

616
00:41:00,604 --> 00:41:04,974
My secretary here will settle the bill.

617
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:08,375
So what do you have in store for me, Womack, when this is over?

618
00:41:08,455 --> 00:41:11,315
You'll get your life back, Mason.

619
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:14,255
But you could've given me my life back years ago.

620
00:41:17,696 --> 00:41:20,406
Why should I trust you now?

621
00:41:20,427 --> 00:41:21,987
You've got my word.

622
00:41:23,237 --> 00:41:26,397
Will you shake on it?

623
00:41:37,179 --> 00:41:40,239
Freeze, mister!

624
00:41:40,249 --> 00:41:43,049
Help!

625
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:46,019
Drop the gun, or I drop your boss.

626
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:49,290
You will not!

627
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:52,440
He's getting very heavy.

628
00:41:52,471 --> 00:41:53,871
Then pull him up.

629
00:41:57,841 --> 00:42:01,371
Please don't!

630
00:42:01,442 --> 00:42:04,242
Help! Shit!

631
00:42:04,312 --> 00:42:07,072
Come on. Have a scallop. Come on. Catch.

632
00:42:13,853 --> 00:42:16,853
You hoist him!

633
00:42:16,864 --> 00:42:19,454
Help! Help! Help!

634
00:42:19,534 --> 00:42:20,364
Where's Mason? Where is Mason?

635
00:42:20,434 --> 00:42:21,334
Help! Hang on!

636
00:42:21,804 --> 00:42:22,684
Where's Mason?

637
00:42:22,735 --> 00:42:24,365
-Mason's gone!  -Gone?

638
00:42:29,475 --> 00:42:32,105
Living room's clear!

639
00:42:32,176 --> 00:42:35,036
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

640
00:42:35,046 --> 00:42:38,446
All units, this is Caretaker. We have a Signal Six. He's in the hotel!

641
00:42:44,327 --> 00:42:46,287
Okay, I don't wanna know nothin'.

642
00:42:46,328 --> 00:42:48,558
I never saw you throw that gentleman off the balcony.

643
00:42:48,668 --> 00:42:53,428
All I care about is, a-are you happy with your haircut?

644
00:42:54,499 --> 00:42:56,269
Easy!

645
00:42:57,169 --> 00:43:01,339
Watch it, you fuckhead, you're gonna pull my arm out!

646
00:43:45,725 --> 00:43:51,755
This is my Humvee. I don't want any dings, dents or scratches, or I'll have your ass. Hey!

647
00:43:51,766 --> 00:43:53,496
Hey! Stop! Hey!

648
00:44:05,718 --> 00:44:07,848
FBI.

649
00:44:18,499 --> 00:44:20,229
Move!

650
00:44:29,681 --> 00:44:33,161
Suspect is in a black Humvee, heading west on California.

651
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:35,441
Speed approximately 70 miles per hour.

652
00:44:41,962 --> 00:44:46,122
Get out of the way!

653
00:44:48,163 --> 00:44:50,653
I want a net put on this son of a bitch, you hear me?

654
00:45:23,738 --> 00:45:26,708
This guy's hittin' every fuckin' thing in sight tryin' to block us!

655
00:46:03,883 --> 00:46:07,713
I hope you're insured!

656
00:46:15,764 --> 00:46:18,564
Oh, well, why not?

657
00:46:33,717 --> 00:46:36,737
You're goin' down!

658
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:04,620
Hello? I'm only borrowing your Humvee!

659
00:47:08,191 --> 00:47:12,351
Information? San Francisco?

660
00:47:12,421 --> 00:47:15,591
Uh, Jade Angelou. That's A-N-G...

661
00:47:17,162 --> 00:47:20,132
Welcome aboard, y'all. How y'all doin' today?

662
00:47:22,603 --> 00:47:25,663
Hang on!

663
00:47:28,874 --> 00:47:31,174
Holy shit!

664
00:47:44,296 --> 00:47:47,836
Oh, no!

665
00:47:51,206 --> 00:47:54,036
We're gonna crash! Save yourselves!

666
00:47:59,077 --> 00:48:01,777
Oh, my baby!

667
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:23,870
Oh, no.

668
00:48:26,781 --> 00:48:29,701
Oh, God!

669
00:48:30,611 --> 00:48:32,481
Oh, God!

670
00:48:51,304 --> 00:48:54,904
Hey, man, you just fucked up your Ferrari.

671
00:48:56,755 --> 00:48:57,905
It's not mine.

672
00:48:58,975 --> 00:49:00,605
Neither is this!

673
00:49:04,686 --> 00:49:08,126
Damn! This sucks! Where's that son of a bitch at?

674
00:49:08,186 --> 00:49:11,916
I'm gonna hunt him down! That motherfucker ain't safe nowhere.

675
00:49:12,927 --> 00:49:14,217
Chem weapons. Isherwood.

676
00:49:14,267 --> 00:49:15,257
Marvin!

677
00:49:15,367 --> 00:49:17,697
Look up Wolfburg Federal Penitentiary.

678
00:49:17,797 --> 00:49:19,607
The inmate is Mason, John.

679
00:49:19,618 --> 00:49:23,338
Hey, Stan, listen, I'm gettin' out of this government shithole.

680
00:49:23,408 --> 00:49:26,618
I'm goin' over to Orkin to design roach motels. Cool, huh?

681
00:49:26,629 --> 00:49:27,829
Look, I just stole a kid's motorcycle.

682
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,019
I'm not really feeling too good about it, okay?

683
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,749
Wolfburg. Got it?

684
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:35,109
Yeah, I got it. All right, Magrane, Masconi, Masters. No Mason.

685
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:37,270
Go to February '76.

686
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,480
Who was transferred to Wolfburg from San Quentin?

687
00:49:41,661 --> 00:49:43,951
This is weird. They got medical records.

688
00:49:43,961 --> 00:49:46,581
They got place of birth. Glasgow.

689
00:49:46,631 --> 00:49:47,761
Uh, but they don't have a name.

690
00:49:49,372 --> 00:49:51,062
Uh, wait a minute, wait a minute. They have next of kin.

691
00:49:51,142 --> 00:49:55,442
A Jade Angelou of 32 Stenson Drive, San Francisco.

692
00:50:15,135 --> 00:50:16,865
Jade?

693
00:50:16,935 --> 00:50:20,665
No, Stacy. Jade's friend.

694
00:50:25,976 --> 00:50:28,276
Were you afraid to come alone?

695
00:50:28,286 --> 00:50:30,336
Yeah.

696
00:50:31,317 --> 00:50:32,937
It's okay.

697
00:50:32,987 --> 00:50:34,617
I'll be over here if you need me.

698
00:50:34,787 --> 00:50:39,447
The last photograph I had of you, you were about ten.

699
00:50:39,528 --> 00:50:41,488
Yeah?

700
00:50:41,498 --> 00:50:46,558
Well, I found a picture of you among my mom's things when she died.

701
00:50:47,939 --> 00:50:52,999
Oh, yeah? Well, uh... Why don't we take a walk?

702
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:55,980
I got 'im. Palace of Fine Arts.

703
00:50:56,040 --> 00:51:00,210
Your mother, uh... Yeah, well, sh-she was very special.

704
00:51:00,221 --> 00:51:02,111
Yeah, she was.

705
00:51:02,121 --> 00:51:06,871
But I don't think that we should romanticize what happened between you and her.

706
00:51:06,881 --> 00:51:10,511
Meeting in a bar after a Led Zeppelin concert.

707
00:51:10,522 --> 00:51:12,662
Head out, and I was the result.

708
00:51:12,732 --> 00:51:16,532
Well, I'd like to think it would've led somewhere if only...

709
00:51:16,543 --> 00:51:19,623
If only what? Six federal marshals hadn't kicked down our door...

710
00:51:19,633 --> 00:51:21,563
and dragged you back to prison?

711
00:51:22,673 --> 00:51:25,663
-I'm sorry.  -It's all right.

712
00:51:26,914 --> 00:51:28,084
So, they let you out?

713
00:51:28,144 --> 00:51:29,084
Yeah.

714
00:51:30,614 --> 00:51:33,104
That's good.

715
00:51:34,455 --> 00:51:37,755
What did you do?

716
00:51:41,896 --> 00:51:48,126
Jade, I don't have a great deal of time here.

717
00:51:48,207 --> 00:51:50,967
But I'll be coming back. And, uh...

718
00:51:51,037 --> 00:51:52,347
Maybe we can...

719
00:51:52,377 --> 00:51:54,137
What? We can what?

720
00:51:55,678 --> 00:52:02,808
You know, you're almost the only evidence...that I exist.

721
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:04,729
But I don't know you.

722
00:52:04,739 --> 00:52:07,419
That's what I want to change, eh?

723
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:16,460
I've rehearsed this speech a thousand times on the chance that we would meet.

724
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:19,440
Here we are, and I'm lost.

725
00:52:19,501 --> 00:52:22,411
Well, I don't know how I'm supposed to be feeling either.

726
00:52:22,611 --> 00:52:26,471
Jade, I'm not an evil man.

727
00:52:26,552 --> 00:52:29,742
If you can believe that, then it's a start.

728
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:35,352
Okay.

729
00:52:46,334 --> 00:52:48,774
Is this about you?

730
00:53:00,516 --> 00:53:04,396
You broke out of prison again, didn't you?

731
00:53:04,456 --> 00:53:05,446
Why did you come to me?

732
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:08,707
FBI, ma'am. Your father's working with us.

733
00:53:08,717 --> 00:53:11,957
He's helping us resolve a dangerous situation.

734
00:53:11,967 --> 00:53:13,867
-He is?  -Yes, ma'am.

735
00:53:13,878 --> 00:53:17,508
Well, gee whiz, John, I guess we oughta get goin', huh?

736
00:53:17,568 --> 00:53:20,058
Whatever you say, Stanley.

737
00:53:25,779 --> 00:53:28,749
Thank you for that. You could've handled it differently.

738
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:32,050
What do you say we cut the chitchat, a-hole?

739
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:36,080
You almost got me killed twice. And my jaw hurts like hell!

740
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:37,110
Good.

741
00:53:37,261 --> 00:53:39,161
Cocksucker!

742
00:53:39,231 --> 00:53:42,061
If I had my way, you would be shipped back to Wolfburg in leg irons...

743
00:53:42,131 --> 00:53:45,591
and caged like an animal for the rest of your natural fucking life!

744
00:53:45,602 --> 00:53:48,762
You wrecked half the city!

745
00:53:52,212 --> 00:53:54,372
Now, tell me about the tunnels.

746
00:53:54,443 --> 00:53:59,753
If you know the system, it will take you wherever you need to go.

747
00:53:59,823 --> 00:54:02,353
All right, there's an intake pipe here, below low tide.

748
00:54:02,384 --> 00:54:03,754
Is that our best access?

749
00:54:04,024 --> 00:54:06,324
Yes. That's exactly where I had come out.

750
00:54:06,394 --> 00:54:08,134
Then beneath the cistern, there's a connection to the abandoned septic system.

751
00:54:08,145 --> 00:54:09,895
Then beneath the cistern, there's a connection to the abandoned septic system.

752
00:54:09,965 --> 00:54:11,655
How many feet is that?

753
00:54:11,735 --> 00:54:14,935
Uh, 57 paces.

754
00:54:15,005 --> 00:54:17,135
Where do we go from there?

755
00:54:19,946 --> 00:54:23,246
Where do we go from there?

756
00:54:23,316 --> 00:54:25,806
That's a good question.

757
00:54:26,447 --> 00:54:28,357
I have no idea.

758
00:54:28,417 --> 00:54:29,217
What?

759
00:54:30,687 --> 00:54:33,987
I mean, I'll know it when we're all inside.

760
00:54:34,058 --> 00:54:37,518
No. You're not goddamn goin'. Show us on the blueprints.

761
00:54:37,528 --> 00:54:41,388
I can't! My blueprint was in my head.

762
00:54:41,399 --> 00:54:45,089
I was underground for three days in the dark...

763
00:54:45,099 --> 00:54:47,999
just waiting for the tides to be right.

764
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:51,570
But don't worry. It'll all come back to me.

765
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:54,090
You're not going anywhere, Mason.

766
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:58,670
Wait a second. Now, this piece of work might be the only chance those people over there have.

767
00:54:58,681 --> 00:55:02,281
If he's not going, then why the hell did we get him out of jail?

768
00:55:02,361 --> 00:55:05,811
-He's smart.  -I got him out to get you people in, not go with you.

769
00:55:05,892 --> 00:55:10,092
If it's the only way of getting the intelligence I need, then he goes.

770
00:55:10,102 --> 00:55:11,672
He'll fuck with you.

771
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:16,273
You compromise my men's lives, and I'll bury you out there.

772
00:55:17,843 --> 00:55:19,893
Now, Womack...

773
00:55:19,944 --> 00:55:22,644
you're between The Rock and a hard case.

774
00:55:24,944 --> 00:55:28,214
How is your bowling arm?

775
00:55:29,625 --> 00:55:32,205
Dr. Goodspeed, the goal is to take out the launchers,

776
00:55:32,215 --> 00:55:34,015
then neutralize the V.X. Chemical rounds.

777
00:55:34,095 --> 00:55:37,685
Well, we know the poison's being kept in the prison morgue from the satellite thermal imaging...

778
00:55:37,766 --> 00:55:40,196
which is right here; these colorized dots.

779
00:55:40,206 --> 00:55:42,866
Have you ever actually seen one of these devices?

780
00:55:42,907 --> 00:55:44,737
No, sir, but I've studied them.

781
00:55:44,907 --> 00:55:48,367
I should really begin briefing your guys on defusing and detoxification.

782
00:55:48,437 --> 00:55:51,107
Got a really neat layout over here of the chem round as well as the rocket...

783
00:55:51,178 --> 00:55:52,318
So let's get rolling.

784
00:55:52,378 --> 00:55:53,508
That won't be necessary.

785
00:55:55,918 --> 00:55:58,748
Oh, it's very necessary, sir.

786
00:55:58,759 --> 00:56:02,429
The power of this chemical is way beyond anything you can imagine.

787
00:56:02,439 --> 00:56:04,349
An ecological disaster, sir.

788
00:56:04,429 --> 00:56:06,799
Plus the devices themselves are complicated.

789
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:08,450
That's why you're coming with us.

790
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:16,500
-I am?  -You're the expert. What's your problem?

791
00:56:16,571 --> 00:56:21,271
You mean I'm going, going out there, under the water?

792
00:56:21,342 --> 00:56:23,612
Well, earlier today you wanted a gun.

793
00:56:23,682 --> 00:56:26,272
Now you're getting a gun and a wet suit.

794
00:56:26,282 --> 00:56:28,352
Have you ever been in a combat situation?

795
00:56:28,362 --> 00:56:29,972
Define "combat," sir.

796
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:30,953
Shep?

797
00:56:31,393 --> 00:56:34,913
An incursion underwater to retake an impregnable fortress held by an elite team...

798
00:56:34,993 --> 00:56:38,193
of U.S. Marines in possession of 81 hostages and 15 guided rockets...

799
00:56:38,204 --> 00:56:41,364
armed with V.X. Poisoned gas.

800
00:56:41,434 --> 00:56:45,234
Oh. In that case, no, sir. Excuse me.

801
00:56:51,675 --> 00:56:53,615
-Here.  -Ah, thank you.

802
00:56:56,386 --> 00:56:58,946
You don't look too good.

803
00:56:58,956 --> 00:57:01,716
In fact, you look like shit.

804
00:57:01,787 --> 00:57:05,087
My stomach's doing hula hoops around my ass.

805
00:57:05,927 --> 00:57:07,917
You all right?

806
00:57:07,927 --> 00:57:10,757
I mean, you gonna make it through this thing?

807
00:57:10,768 --> 00:57:12,398
I don't know.

808
00:57:12,408 --> 00:57:16,168
I always expected something like this was going to happen...

809
00:57:16,179 --> 00:57:18,339
but nothing prepares you for it.

810
00:57:18,409 --> 00:57:20,779
Now I'm... I'm responsible...

811
00:57:20,849 --> 00:57:22,819
for a whole city.

812
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:27,620
Look, I know this isn't easy for you.

813
00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:29,990
Remember, you were trained for this kind of a situation...

814
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:32,110
and believe me, it'll come back to you.

815
00:57:32,121 --> 00:57:35,561
Besides, you got the best SEAL team in the country backing you up.

816
00:57:35,631 --> 00:57:38,891
Okay. You're right.

817
00:57:38,901 --> 00:57:43,091
I-I'll be on the wire. I'll help talk you through it.

818
00:57:43,172 --> 00:57:46,002
There's something else.

819
00:57:46,072 --> 00:57:49,632
It's terrible. N-No, it's wonderful...

820
00:57:49,713 --> 00:57:52,183
except it isn't.

821
00:57:52,253 --> 00:57:55,543
My girlfriend's pregnant...

822
00:57:55,624 --> 00:57:59,524
and she's just flown in to see me.

823
00:57:59,594 --> 00:58:02,354
You keep your mind on what you're going to be doing out there tonight.

824
00:58:02,364 --> 00:58:17,645
And I'll send someone to pick up your girlfriend and bring her here to the command center.

825
00:58:17,646 --> 00:58:18,866
Hummel!

826
00:58:18,907 --> 00:58:22,037
Hello, Frank. Lou Linstrom.

827
00:58:22,177 --> 00:58:25,917
I'm at the White House with General Kramer.

828
00:58:25,987 --> 00:58:29,497
Uh, Frank, uh, we're havin' a few problems with the account transfer.

829
00:58:29,508 --> 00:58:31,738
Don't tell me problems. Tell me solutions.

830
00:58:31,788 --> 00:58:33,058
Now, we've spoken to the president...

831
00:58:33,128 --> 00:58:36,468
and I know that you're well aware of his stance on terrorism.

832
00:58:36,479 --> 00:58:40,409
-So what we'd like to do is...  -This isn't about terrorism. This is about justice.

833
00:58:40,419 --> 00:58:44,029
It's about reminding you people who found it politically convenient to forget.

834
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:46,240
This is goin' nowhere, Frank.

835
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:47,890
Well, then, let me tell you what is.

836
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:51,050
Fifteen V.X. Gas rockets into the heart of San Francisco.

837
00:58:51,061 --> 00:58:53,351
You've got 17 hours to deliver the money.

838
00:58:53,361 --> 00:58:56,051
Or be prepared to reap the whirlwind, gentlemen.

839
00:59:00,492 --> 00:59:02,012
What's the word from Mojave?

840
00:59:02,022 --> 00:59:03,942
General Peterson can give us...

841
00:59:03,992 --> 00:59:07,162
no definite assurance on the thermite plasma.

842
00:59:07,233 --> 00:59:09,363
That is the word.

843
00:59:13,473 --> 00:59:15,963
Green light to SEAL incursion.

844
00:59:33,526 --> 00:59:37,556
Fall in! All right, listen up.

845
00:59:37,637 --> 00:59:39,427
Mr. Mason will run point for us.

846
00:59:39,437 --> 00:59:41,827
Lieutenant Shepard will be attached to his hip.

847
00:59:41,907 --> 00:59:45,927
You breathe, he breathes with you. You piss, he helps.

848
00:59:45,938 --> 00:59:48,138
Understood?

849
00:59:48,208 --> 00:59:50,118
Dr. Goodspeed is our specialist.

850
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:55,278
When he neutralizes the threat, we launch green flares and we wait for the cavalry.

851
00:59:55,349 --> 00:59:59,429
Make no mistake, gentlemen. We're in the fight of our lives...

852
00:59:59,439 --> 01:00:04,759
against maybe the greatest battalion commander in the Vietnam War. I shit you not.

853
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:06,760
Any questions?

854
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:10,500
Let's load up!

855
01:00:17,782 --> 01:00:21,082
After you, ace.

856
01:00:41,675 --> 01:00:45,005
Pass out and activate the minicams.

857
01:00:47,475 --> 01:00:51,415
Everything set here? Minicams operational?

858
01:00:51,946 --> 01:00:54,886
Roger that, sir. We are on-line.

859
01:00:57,957 --> 01:01:03,647
Shep, what's the status on the special operational gear for Mr. Mason?

860
01:01:03,728 --> 01:01:11,769
Uh, let's see. We have, uh...one quart of kerosene in a squeeze bottle.

861
01:01:13,869 --> 01:01:19,639
Three washers and waterproof matches.

862
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:23,630
Use the green flares to signal when the threat has been neutralized.

863
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:26,010
Now, this is atropine. If you come in contact with the gas...

864
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:27,850
you have 20 seconds to inject it into your heart.

865
01:01:27,921 --> 01:01:31,261
Don't fuck with me on this. It may save your life.

866
01:01:34,161 --> 01:01:37,921
I have three incoming bogeys bearing 275.

867
01:01:38,002 --> 01:01:40,432
Range: 6,000 meters.

868
01:01:43,803 --> 01:01:46,863
FBI Command Center?

869
01:01:46,943 --> 01:01:48,833
Oh, I would just love for you to tell me what is goin' on.

870
01:01:48,883 --> 01:01:49,773
Nope.

871
01:01:50,183 --> 01:01:51,463
Listen, Stanley Goodspeed is my boyfriend.

872
01:01:51,514 --> 01:01:53,554
Actually, he's, um, my fiance.

873
01:01:53,564 --> 01:01:55,924
-Where is he?  -Classified, lady.

874
01:01:55,984 --> 01:01:59,364
Okay. Well, you just sit here and act like a Bureau bonehead, then.

875
01:01:59,375 --> 01:02:01,255
Hey, where are you g... Goddamn it!

876
01:02:05,635 --> 01:02:08,895
Decoy choppers commencing run to Alcatraz.

877
01:02:09,906 --> 01:02:12,516
I just lost one, sir. I just lost one.

878
01:02:12,526 --> 01:02:15,066
-We only got two flying in. I just lost one.

879
01:02:15,107 --> 01:02:16,097
Shit!

880
01:02:26,458 --> 01:02:30,388
In my day, we did it all with a snorkel and a pair of flippers.

881
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:31,119
Your day?

882
01:02:31,159 --> 01:02:33,099
Yes. Didn't you read my resume?

883
01:02:33,629 --> 01:02:36,689
I don't... I don't know anything about you.

884
01:02:36,769 --> 01:02:37,969
Hmm. I know something about you, Godspell.

885
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:38,830
Goodspeed.

886
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:42,460
Goodspeed, Godspeed, Godspell...

887
01:02:42,470 --> 01:02:45,800
you never went to any antiterrorist school.

888
01:02:45,881 --> 01:02:48,811
So just make sure you don't get us all fucking killed.

889
01:02:51,051 --> 01:02:52,681
We're goin' dark.

890
01:02:52,721 --> 01:02:54,081
Night vision!

891
01:02:56,522 --> 01:02:58,822
Raider One has dropped below radar coverage...

892
01:02:58,892 --> 01:03:00,822
heading around Treasure Island.

893
01:03:02,163 --> 01:03:05,993
Sir, we've got two bogeys bearing due east and closing.

894
01:03:11,344 --> 01:03:12,774
Decoys?

895
01:03:12,844 --> 01:03:14,224
Prepare to deploy!

896
01:03:14,244 --> 01:03:15,544
Good luck, Commander.

897
01:03:20,915 --> 01:03:22,885
Sir, Raider One is at the drop zone.

898
01:03:24,656 --> 01:03:28,386
Stanley's not a very good swimmer. I mean, he can't even snorkel.

899
01:03:29,356 --> 01:03:30,946
Everyone, good to go?

900
01:03:30,996 --> 01:03:32,246
Good to go!

901
01:03:32,257 --> 01:03:35,797
-Good to go!  -Good to go! Good to go!

902
01:03:45,248 --> 01:03:48,038
All right, so the S.D.U. S have been deployed, and the Eagles are in the water.

903
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:00,260
Major, I want the perimeter patrolled to the west end of the island.

904
01:04:00,330 --> 01:04:02,490
-Double-time it.  -Yes, sir. Hendrix!

905
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:04,590
-You lead the patrol.  -Aye, aye, sir.

906
01:04:04,671 --> 01:04:06,721
Let's move. Move out! Move out! Move out!

907
01:05:02,968 --> 01:05:04,588
The Eagles are on The Rock.

908
01:05:04,638 --> 01:05:06,428
They've entered the cistern room.

909
01:05:13,379 --> 01:05:15,679
Thank you very fucking much, Mr. Mason.

910
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:18,080
You've led us into a room with no exit.

911
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:22,660
Any ideas, Dillinger?

912
01:05:22,691 --> 01:05:24,811
Figure it out soon. We're sitting ducks.

913
01:05:25,061 --> 01:05:26,981
We're a little tight on time.

914
01:05:26,991 --> 01:05:29,911
You stand by the door until I open it.

915
01:05:29,922 --> 01:05:33,332
I'd like to know how you plan on accomplishing that?

916
01:05:33,662 --> 01:05:36,602
Through here.

917
01:05:41,943 --> 01:05:43,793
You're shitting me.

918
01:05:43,843 --> 01:05:46,363
I memorized the timing.

919
01:05:46,414 --> 01:05:48,344
I just hope it hasn't been changed.

920
01:05:48,414 --> 01:05:51,384
You catch one of those flame bursts, you're a corpse.

921
01:05:51,394 --> 01:05:51,824
Thank you.

922
01:05:51,834 --> 01:05:54,014
Commander, you said never to leave his sight, but, uh...

923
01:05:54,155 --> 01:05:56,845
Stand fast, Lieutenant.

924
01:05:57,195 --> 01:05:59,785
Have a nice day.

925
01:06:21,658 --> 01:06:23,858
Where'd you dig up this guy?

926
01:06:23,888 --> 01:06:25,148
That's classified.

927
01:06:32,770 --> 01:06:36,240
Clear here, sir. No motion sensors tripped.

928
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:38,570
Nothing.

929
01:06:38,610 --> 01:06:39,400
Well, tell 'em to stay out there.

930
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:42,440
Sweep forward!

931
01:06:51,392 --> 01:06:53,972
Looks like he fucked us, Commander.

932
01:06:53,982 --> 01:06:57,252
I knew it. That son of a bitch jumped ship.

933
01:07:02,703 --> 01:07:04,633
Welcome to The Rock.

934
01:07:19,816 --> 01:07:22,216
-Mason.  -That's a no-no.

935
01:07:22,286 --> 01:07:23,356
That's the subway.

936
01:07:23,386 --> 01:07:25,386
That'll drop you into the tunnels.

937
01:07:25,626 --> 01:07:28,316
Do it!

938
01:07:44,149 --> 01:07:48,309
Sir, the Eagles have breached the tunnel system.

939
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:56,750
You enjoying this?

940
01:07:56,760 --> 01:08:00,360
Well, it's certainly more enjoyable than my average day.

941
01:08:00,371 --> 01:08:04,901
Reading philosophy, avoiding gang rape in the washroom.

942
01:08:04,911 --> 01:08:06,501
Though it's less of a problem these days.

943
01:08:06,511 --> 01:08:08,261
Maybe I'm losing my sex appeal.

944
01:08:13,442 --> 01:08:16,712
We've got seismic activity in one of the storm grates. North side.

945
01:08:16,783 --> 01:08:19,583
Continue patrolling the area.

946
01:08:19,653 --> 01:08:21,583
Sweep forward!

947
01:08:22,924 --> 01:08:25,084
Commander, halt. We've got movement.

948
01:08:26,394 --> 01:08:28,364
They're hearing sounds above, sir.

949
01:08:28,394 --> 01:08:29,384
Stand fast.

950
01:08:29,864 --> 01:08:32,694
Down, down, down.

951
01:08:37,936 --> 01:08:40,566
West storm drain's clear.

952
01:08:44,876 --> 01:08:48,646
Ninety-seven paces to the shower room.

953
01:08:52,327 --> 01:08:56,157
The Eagles are now at the access tunnel. They're right under the shower room, sir.

954
01:09:03,969 --> 01:09:06,099
Fiber optics.

955
01:09:08,779 --> 01:09:09,889
Something's not right.

956
01:09:09,940 --> 01:09:11,710
I got a bad feeling about this.

957
01:09:31,262 --> 01:09:33,832
Quiet.

958
01:09:42,984 --> 01:09:46,604
Motion sensors.

959
01:09:46,684 --> 01:09:47,904
Beams cutting across the manhole covers.

960
01:09:47,954 --> 01:09:49,754
Deal with it.

961
01:09:55,025 --> 01:10:01,895
Commander, the beam is hitting some sort of reflective device. Possibly a prism.

962
01:10:04,207 --> 01:10:07,437
I want to use a mirror to cut the beam...

963
01:10:07,507 --> 01:10:09,597
send the beam back to its source.

964
01:10:09,647 --> 01:10:11,107
And then I'm gonna move the prism.

965
01:10:15,718 --> 01:10:18,778
We've got motion on a trembler in the shower room, sir.

966
01:10:18,858 --> 01:10:19,858
We've got visitors.

967
01:10:19,889 --> 01:10:20,879
Let's move.

968
01:10:24,189 --> 01:10:26,889
Got it. Good to go.

969
01:10:26,899 --> 01:10:31,929
-Fuck, man! I knew this would happen! Fuck!  -Move!

970
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,200
Stand fast. We'll secure the area.

971
01:10:45,112 --> 01:10:48,612
They're entering into the shower room, sir.

972
01:10:50,592 --> 01:10:53,782
They're securing the area.

973
01:11:02,074 --> 01:11:04,974
Just sit tight.

974
01:11:07,705 --> 01:11:09,935
Drop your weapons! Drop 'em!

975
01:11:09,945 --> 01:11:11,285
Stand fast!

976
01:11:11,295 --> 01:11:12,435
Hold your fire!

977
01:11:12,885 --> 01:11:13,535
Drop your weapons!

978
01:11:13,585 --> 01:11:14,845
Hold your fire!

979
01:11:17,916 --> 01:11:21,546
It's a fucking trap.

980
01:11:21,626 --> 01:11:23,316
This is General Hummel.

981
01:11:23,397 --> 01:11:25,237
Drop your weapons.

982
01:11:25,397 --> 01:11:26,417
Drop 'em!

983
01:11:27,197 --> 01:11:30,227
Anderson here, General Hummel.

984
01:11:30,237 --> 01:11:32,897
Commander. Team leader.

985
01:11:32,968 --> 01:11:35,958
Commander Anderson, if you have any concern for the lives of your men...

986
01:11:36,038 --> 01:11:39,098
you will order them to safety their weapons and place them on the deck.

987
01:11:39,109 --> 01:11:41,079
This is not happening.

988
01:11:41,149 --> 01:11:43,939
Sir, we know why you're out here.

989
01:11:43,949 --> 01:11:47,049
God knows I agree with you.

990
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:50,390
But like you, I swore to defend this country against all enemies...

991
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:54,950
foreign, sir, and domestic.

992
01:11:54,961 --> 01:11:58,841
General, we've spilled the same blood in the same mud.

993
01:11:58,851 --> 01:12:02,171
You know goddamn well I can't give that order.

994
01:12:02,182 --> 01:12:03,352
We're dead.

995
01:12:03,362 --> 01:12:07,162
Your unit is covered from an elevated position, Commander.

996
01:12:07,172 --> 01:12:11,172
I'm not gonna ask you again. Don't do anything stupid.

997
01:12:11,313 --> 01:12:13,213
No one has to die here.

998
01:12:13,223 --> 01:12:18,223
Men following the general, you're under oath as United States Marines!

999
01:12:18,284 --> 01:12:21,344
Have you forgotten that?

1000
01:12:21,424 --> 01:12:23,604
We all have shipmates we remember.

1001
01:12:23,614 --> 01:12:26,634
Some of them were shit on and pissed on by the Pentagon.

1002
01:12:26,645 --> 01:12:28,945
But that doesn't give you the right to mutiny!

1003
01:12:29,005 --> 01:12:31,125
You call it what you want!

1004
01:12:31,135 --> 01:12:34,585
You're down there, we're up here. You walked into the wrong goddamn room, Commander!

1005
01:12:34,596 --> 01:12:37,346
-Stand fast!  -Goddamn it, Commander, one last time.

1006
01:12:37,406 --> 01:12:39,626
You tell your men to safety their weapons, drop 'em on the deck.

1007
01:12:39,636 --> 01:12:42,376
-I cannot give that order!  -I am not gonna repeat that order!

1008
01:12:42,387 --> 01:12:45,187
-I will not give that order!  -What the hell is wrong with you, man?

1009
01:12:45,197 --> 01:12:48,047
-Stand fast!  -Oh, my God!

1010
01:12:48,117 --> 01:12:51,617
-Let's waste these fuckers.  -One last time. You order your men to safety their weapons...

1011
01:12:58,599 --> 01:13:01,159
Cease fire!

1012
01:13:19,721 --> 01:13:22,851
Don't go.

1013
01:13:24,132 --> 01:13:26,702
Cease fire!

1014
01:13:35,043 --> 01:13:37,513
Cease fire!

1015
01:13:37,574 --> 01:13:39,734
Shit! Goddamn it!

1016
01:13:39,814 --> 01:13:42,214
Let go of me. Let go of me!

1017
01:13:42,284 --> 01:13:44,414
Don't. Don't go.

1018
01:14:32,741 --> 01:14:35,471
It's over.

1019
01:14:44,722 --> 01:14:47,312
Oh, God!

1020
01:15:18,857 --> 01:15:20,067
-We got some movement.  -Who?

1021
01:15:20,097 --> 01:15:20,927
Two of 'em!

1022
01:15:21,397 --> 01:15:22,077
Who is it?

1023
01:15:22,087 --> 01:15:23,167
Eagles 11 and 12.

1024
01:15:23,197 --> 01:15:24,067
L-lt's Goodspeed and Mason.

1025
01:15:24,127 --> 01:15:25,227
I knew it.

1026
01:15:25,337 --> 01:15:28,727
I've gotta get a team together right now. We've gotta move with the second option.

1027
01:15:28,808 --> 01:15:31,358
What, and invite another massacre? No way.

1028
01:15:31,368 --> 01:15:35,938
We've got a 60-year-old convict and a lab rat. I'm telling you, it's over.

1029
01:15:36,009 --> 01:15:38,169
Not for Mason, it isn't.

1030
01:15:49,391 --> 01:15:53,721
Goodspeed, I'm not gonna kill you.

1031
01:15:55,701 --> 01:15:57,221
Where are you going?

1032
01:15:57,272 --> 01:15:58,462
Off this bloody island.

1033
01:15:58,572 --> 01:16:00,662
What? Wh-Wh-What for?

1034
01:16:00,672 --> 01:16:05,102
Goodspeed. Goodspeed, do you read me?

1035
01:16:05,113 --> 01:16:07,583
It's for you.

1036
01:16:08,113 --> 01:16:09,343
Sir?

1037
01:16:09,383 --> 01:16:10,643
What's the status?

1038
01:16:11,253 --> 01:16:14,053
The status is they're dead. They're dead!

1039
01:16:14,124 --> 01:16:16,184
It's just me and Mason. Now he says he's leaving.

1040
01:16:16,254 --> 01:16:20,594
That is unacceptable. Do you hear me? Unacceptable!

1041
01:16:20,665 --> 01:16:23,575
Well, there's a problem, sir. He's got a gun.

1042
01:16:23,585 --> 01:16:25,825
What do you have, a fuckin' water pistol?

1043
01:16:25,865 --> 01:16:26,525
No, sir.

1044
01:16:26,565 --> 01:16:29,295
Go after him and stop him.

1045
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:33,146
I didn't want this.

1046
01:16:33,176 --> 01:16:34,546
Jesus, I didn't want this.

1047
01:16:34,576 --> 01:16:35,736
You knew this might happen, Frank.

1048
01:16:36,447 --> 01:16:39,577
-Well, maybe now they'll pay up.  -Maybe now they won't, Captain.

1049
01:16:39,647 --> 01:16:42,117
Then maybe we need to execute a few hostages.

1050
01:16:42,127 --> 01:16:43,127
Got a live one!

1051
01:16:43,157 --> 01:16:44,487
Put a bullet in him.

1052
01:16:45,588 --> 01:16:46,628
You heard him. End it!

1053
01:16:46,658 --> 01:16:48,358
Holster that sidearm, Captain.

1054
01:17:07,611 --> 01:17:09,551
Sir?

1055
01:17:12,451 --> 01:17:15,491
You made a terrible mistake.

1056
01:17:15,562 --> 01:17:18,822
And more of our brothers have died in vain.

1057
01:17:18,832 --> 01:17:22,022
Damn you for forcing me into this position.

1058
01:17:24,463 --> 01:17:28,093
I need to talk to you right now, alone.

1059
01:17:28,173 --> 01:17:30,073
Now you told me I'm on a need-to-know basis.

1060
01:17:30,083 --> 01:17:31,433
And I'm tellin' you right now.

1061
01:17:31,474 --> 01:17:34,674
I need to know who the fuck John Mason is right now, sir.

1062
01:17:35,414 --> 01:17:37,514
All right, you wanna know?

1063
01:17:37,544 --> 01:17:40,254
1962, J. Edgar Hoover...

1064
01:17:40,285 --> 01:17:41,165
is head of the FBI.

1065
01:17:41,175 --> 01:17:42,445
Some say the country.

1066
01:17:42,585 --> 01:17:46,975
It's no secret he kept microfilm files on prominent Americans and Europeans:

1067
01:17:46,986 --> 01:17:50,786
De Gaulle, British members of Parliament, even the prime minister.

1068
01:17:50,866 --> 01:17:53,696
I mean, this guy had dirt on everybody in the world.

1069
01:17:53,706 --> 01:17:57,926
Yeah, I know all the cloak-and-dagger stories. Where does Mason fit in?

1070
01:17:57,937 --> 01:18:00,597
Mason was the British operative who stole the files.

1071
01:18:00,607 --> 01:18:03,737
But our Bureau agents caught him at the Canadian border.

1072
01:18:03,748 --> 01:18:06,848
Of course, the British claimed they'd never heard of him.

1073
01:18:06,918 --> 01:18:08,888
And we held him without trial...

1074
01:18:08,948 --> 01:18:11,758
until he gave up the microfilm.

1075
01:18:11,789 --> 01:18:12,949
But he never did.

1076
01:18:13,419 --> 01:18:16,189
Well, I'm surprised Hoover didn't use his daughter as leverage.

1077
01:18:16,259 --> 01:18:19,559
Hoover was dead in '72. She wasn't born yet.

1078
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:23,260
Today, well, it's a different Bureau.

1079
01:18:23,330 --> 01:18:25,800
So you held this guy without trial his whole life!

1080
01:18:25,841 --> 01:18:26,961
No wonder he's pissed.

1081
01:18:27,201 --> 01:18:32,161
This man knows our most intimate secrets from the last half century:

1082
01:18:32,241 --> 01:18:36,451
The alien landing at Roswell, the truth about the J.F.K. Assassination.

1083
01:18:36,462 --> 01:18:40,382
And Mason's angry, he's lethal, he's a trained killer.

1084
01:18:41,422 --> 01:18:46,052
And he is the only hope that we have got.

1085
01:18:46,123 --> 01:18:49,093
Mason! Mason!

1086
01:18:51,194 --> 01:18:53,664
There are 81 hostages still up there.

1087
01:18:53,674 --> 01:18:55,564
Yeah, like me.

1088
01:18:55,634 --> 01:18:56,784
All right, you wanna play tough?

1089
01:18:56,834 --> 01:18:57,824
You wanna play tough with me?

1090
01:18:58,375 --> 01:18:59,075
Okay. FBI!

1091
01:18:59,105 --> 01:19:00,435
Freeze, sucker!

1092
01:19:02,615 --> 01:19:05,095
I'll fire.

1093
01:19:05,146 --> 01:19:06,276
No, you won't.

1094
01:19:06,946 --> 01:19:09,446
Throw down.

1095
01:19:09,486 --> 01:19:11,146
You're not the sort.

1096
01:19:11,286 --> 01:19:14,086
Let's find out.

1097
01:19:16,127 --> 01:19:19,817
I could; you, no.

1098
01:19:19,827 --> 01:19:22,967
Besides, your safety's on.

1099
01:19:23,038 --> 01:19:26,668
Goodspeed, have you resolved the situation?

1100
01:19:28,138 --> 01:19:31,738
Not yet.

1101
01:19:31,809 --> 01:19:34,439
-He's got all the guns now, sir.  -Shit!

1102
01:19:34,449 --> 01:19:37,839
You're right, I don't use guns and I don't kick down doors.

1103
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:39,050
This is what I do.

1104
01:19:39,090 --> 01:19:40,680
I haven't got my glasses.

1105
01:19:40,690 --> 01:19:44,680
What it says is Chemical Weapons Specialist.

1106
01:19:44,691 --> 01:19:47,741
That's right. I got a lunatic up there, man...

1107
01:19:47,751 --> 01:19:52,791
with 15 missiles armed with some really funky stuff.

1108
01:19:52,802 --> 01:19:57,162
That lying Womack. You could've told my daughter.

1109
01:19:57,172 --> 01:20:01,772
It was classified. Look, I'm in the same situation.

1110
01:20:01,783 --> 01:20:05,613
They've got my girlfriend in the city with a baby on the way.

1111
01:20:05,683 --> 01:20:09,813
Look, I can defuse the rockets. I really can.

1112
01:20:09,884 --> 01:20:11,944
But I'm gonna need your help, and I'm gonna need it right now.

1113
01:20:19,965 --> 01:20:23,135
Sir, this man's weapons and tack radio are missing!

1114
01:20:23,205 --> 01:20:25,975
Shit, we got a rodent problem. Flush the pipes.

1115
01:20:25,986 --> 01:20:30,106
There's probably a maze of tunnels on this goddamn island. Check every access you can find.

1116
01:20:37,187 --> 01:20:43,757
Even if you escape from the island...you can't escape the rockets.

1117
01:20:43,828 --> 01:20:45,108
So, where are you gonna go?

1118
01:20:45,158 --> 01:20:46,818
Go where? What are, what are you gonna do?

1119
01:20:51,469 --> 01:20:52,709
Show me where the morgue is, Mason.

1120
01:20:52,769 --> 01:20:54,499
I'm out of here.

1121
01:20:58,070 --> 01:21:00,740
What about your daughter? Mason?

1122
01:21:02,951 --> 01:21:05,471
Rodents located.

1123
01:21:05,551 --> 01:21:09,851
The way I see it, you don't really have any choice, do you?

1124
01:21:09,861 --> 01:21:12,291
I don't think you do.

1125
01:21:22,503 --> 01:21:25,433
Move!

1126
01:21:49,266 --> 01:21:51,086
They're onto us.

1127
01:21:51,097 --> 01:21:53,937
Burn 'em out.

1128
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:58,367
This mother's gonna blow big.

1129
01:22:39,593 --> 01:22:43,333
I don't understand. How could we lose radio contact all of a sudden?

1130
01:22:43,343 --> 01:22:46,183
We've lost coms. Still got 'em on locaters.

1131
01:22:53,275 --> 01:22:55,835
So what's it gonna be?

1132
01:22:55,875 --> 01:22:56,965
What?

1133
01:22:57,375 --> 01:23:00,835
How do you like your choices?

1134
01:23:00,846 --> 01:23:01,876
I don't.

1135
01:23:01,916 --> 01:23:03,146
That's what I thought.

1136
01:23:04,586 --> 01:23:07,306
All right, come on.

1137
01:23:07,316 --> 01:23:11,256
This is the oldest part of Alcatraz.

1138
01:23:11,327 --> 01:23:14,197
Did you know it was originally a Civil War fort?

1139
01:23:14,257 --> 01:23:15,417
Oh, really?

1140
01:23:15,467 --> 01:23:16,627
Huh. Yeah, wow. You know, I like history, too...

1141
01:23:16,798 --> 01:23:21,448
and maybe when this is all over, you and I can stop by the souvenir shop together.

1142
01:23:21,458 --> 01:23:24,998
But right now I just... I just... I wanna find some rockets.

1143
01:23:25,609 --> 01:23:31,109
Don't tempt me. We are going to the morgue.

1144
01:23:54,042 --> 01:23:55,682
You sure you're ready for this?

1145
01:23:55,713 --> 01:23:57,113
I'll do my best.

1146
01:23:58,013 --> 01:24:00,403
Your best?

1147
01:24:00,483 --> 01:24:04,353
Losers always whine about their best.

1148
01:24:04,414 --> 01:24:07,354
Winners go home and fuck the prom queen.

1149
01:24:08,824 --> 01:24:10,754
Carla was the prom queen.

1150
01:24:10,825 --> 01:24:12,735
Really?

1151
01:24:12,765 --> 01:24:13,785
Yeah.

1152
01:24:16,065 --> 01:24:19,035
Locaters have them approaching the morgue, sir.

1153
01:24:19,106 --> 01:24:21,626
Come on, come on. You can do it, Doc.

1154
01:24:29,447 --> 01:24:31,707
You must never hesitate.

1155
01:24:55,010 --> 01:24:58,270
I think you're shooting too close to the rocket.

1156
01:24:58,351 --> 01:25:00,181
Him, but not the rocket.

1157
01:25:00,191 --> 01:25:02,581
Any other news, Professor?

1158
01:25:05,291 --> 01:25:06,041
Not the rocket!

1159
01:25:06,092 --> 01:25:08,122
Not the rocket.

1160
01:25:23,604 --> 01:25:25,974
I got a little somethin' for ya.

1161
01:25:48,267 --> 01:25:52,367
Oh, yeah, okay. That's just about the most awful thing I've ever seen.

1162
01:25:54,108 --> 01:25:56,078
Mason...

1163
01:25:58,078 --> 01:26:00,738
the second you don't respect this, it kills you.

1164
01:26:00,749 --> 01:26:02,909
Put it over there.

1165
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:16,360
You've been around a lot of corpses. Is that normal?

1166
01:26:17,701 --> 01:26:19,691
-What, the feet thing?  -Yeah, the feet thing.

1167
01:26:19,771 --> 01:26:20,751
Yeah, that happens.

1168
01:26:20,801 --> 01:26:23,081
Well, I'm having kind of a hard time concentrating.

1169
01:26:23,111 --> 01:26:24,501
Can you do something about it?

1170
01:26:24,542 --> 01:26:26,372
Well, like what? Kill him again?

1171
01:26:27,142 --> 01:26:30,082
Listen, I'm just a biochemist.

1172
01:26:30,152 --> 01:26:34,222
And most of the time I work in a glass jar and lead a very uneventful life.

1173
01:26:34,233 --> 01:26:38,203
I drive a Volvo, a beige one. But what I'm dealing with here...

1174
01:26:38,213 --> 01:26:41,283
is one of the most deadly substances the Earth has ever known.

1175
01:26:41,364 --> 01:26:44,054
So what do you say you cut me some friggin' slack?

1176
01:27:00,416 --> 01:27:02,946
A really elegant string-of-pearls configuration.

1177
01:27:02,956 --> 01:27:05,216
Unfortunately, incredibly unstable.

1178
01:27:05,287 --> 01:27:07,107
Well, what exactly does this stuff do?

1179
01:27:07,117 --> 01:27:10,687
If the rocket renders it aerosol, it can take out the entire city of people.

1180
01:27:11,398 --> 01:27:14,108
Really?

1181
01:27:14,128 --> 01:27:15,398
And what happens if you drop one?

1182
01:27:16,068 --> 01:27:19,508
Happily, it'll just wipe out you and me.

1183
01:27:19,539 --> 01:27:20,159
How?

1184
01:27:20,209 --> 01:27:22,609
It's a cholinesterase inhibitor...

1185
01:27:22,679 --> 01:27:25,939
Stops the brain from sending nerve messages down the spinal cord within 30 seconds.

1186
01:27:26,009 --> 01:27:29,389
Any epidermal exposure or inhalation, and you'll know.

1187
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:33,710
A twinge at the small of your back as the poison seizes your nervous system.

1188
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:35,650
Do not move that!

1189
01:27:38,631 --> 01:27:41,321
Your muscles freeze, you can't breathe.

1190
01:27:41,391 --> 01:27:44,661
You spasm so hard you break your own back, spit your guts out.

1191
01:27:44,732 --> 01:27:47,532
But that's after your skin melts off.

1192
01:27:47,542 --> 01:27:50,002
My God.

1193
01:27:50,072 --> 01:27:53,402
Oh, I think we'd like God on our side at the moment, don't you?

1194
01:27:55,413 --> 01:27:58,813
So what I'm doing now is removing the guidance system chips...

1195
01:27:58,884 --> 01:28:00,874
so the rocket will splash down after 500 feet.

1196
01:28:00,954 --> 01:28:03,074
All right, let me have that.

1197
01:28:03,154 --> 01:28:03,924
You can let go of it.

1198
01:28:03,954 --> 01:28:07,024
All right, just back away. Just back away!

1199
01:28:07,035 --> 01:28:10,485
Sir, morgue team has not checked in.

1200
01:28:13,295 --> 01:28:15,265
Blackbird One, this is Blackbird. Over.

1201
01:28:17,166 --> 01:28:20,166
Blackbird One, this is Blackbird. Come in, goddamn it!

1202
01:28:22,407 --> 01:28:25,437
Somebody's still there. Let's move!

1203
01:28:25,447 --> 01:28:28,347
Rats alive! Close on the morgue. Close on the morgue.

1204
01:28:28,417 --> 01:28:30,807
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1205
01:28:30,818 --> 01:28:33,748
Frye, Darrow, hustle up. We got more company!

1206
01:28:38,899 --> 01:28:42,259
Converge on the morgue. Move out.

1207
01:28:43,369 --> 01:28:45,689
Goodspeed, come on. Come over here.

1208
01:28:45,700 --> 01:28:49,300
Good. I love pressure. I eat it for breakfast.

1209
01:28:49,370 --> 01:28:51,100
Come on. Time's up.

1210
01:28:51,170 --> 01:28:53,300
There's three rockets somewhere else. We have to find them.

1211
01:28:56,251 --> 01:28:58,481
Come on!

1212
01:29:21,244 --> 01:29:23,144
I'm too old for this.

1213
01:29:23,214 --> 01:29:24,184
Where's it go?

1214
01:29:24,215 --> 01:29:26,945
I've no idea.

1215
01:29:27,015 --> 01:29:30,385
Sir, all the guidance chips are gone.

1216
01:29:30,455 --> 01:29:32,615
Captain, I guess you didn't quite take care of the rat problem.

1217
01:29:32,686 --> 01:29:33,276
No, sir.

1218
01:29:33,326 --> 01:29:34,716
Well, there are two dead men here...

1219
01:29:34,786 --> 01:29:36,326
who strongly suggest you go finish the job.

1220
01:29:36,326 --> 01:29:37,886
Yes, sir.

1221
01:29:37,896 --> 01:29:41,456
Yes, sir! Rio, Royce, let's go!

1222
01:29:41,527 --> 01:29:43,557
Move out!

1223
01:29:48,508 --> 01:29:49,478
You really don't know where this goes?

1224
01:29:49,538 --> 01:29:50,908
No, I don't know where it goes.

1225
01:29:50,918 --> 01:29:54,138
Well, it's starting to pick up speed. Do you know how to slow it down?

1226
01:29:54,208 --> 01:29:56,238
No, I don't.

1227
01:30:24,382 --> 01:30:26,572
God.

1228
01:30:34,153 --> 01:30:36,953
Mason, you all right?

1229
01:30:36,964 --> 01:30:40,254
Yes, perfectly okay, you fucking idiot!

1230
01:30:42,705 --> 01:30:43,835
They're coming.

1231
01:30:43,865 --> 01:30:45,195
Who?

1232
01:30:45,275 --> 01:30:47,045
The marines!

1233
01:30:47,075 --> 01:30:48,175
Where?

1234
01:31:50,173 --> 01:31:50,903
What the fuck's goin' on?

1235
01:31:50,943 --> 01:31:53,513
Let's cut him off.

1236
01:32:16,436 --> 01:32:19,066
Mason!

1237
01:32:22,117 --> 01:32:24,047
Mason!

1238
01:33:39,437 --> 01:33:44,807
You motherfucker! Die! Die! Die!

1239
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:08,690
I'm rather glad you didn't hesitate too long.

1240
01:34:12,301 --> 01:34:15,671
How do you do it?

1241
01:34:16,812 --> 01:34:21,442
Oh, I was trained by the best. British Intelligence.

1242
01:34:23,653 --> 01:34:25,513
Come on.

1243
01:34:25,583 --> 01:34:29,953
But in retrospect, I'd rather have been a poet or a farmer.

1244
01:34:35,864 --> 01:34:38,764
Okay, the president arrives in three hours.

1245
01:34:38,775 --> 01:34:43,225
His directive is to string Hummel along until the air strike is operational.

1246
01:34:43,235 --> 01:34:45,465
What's the word from Mohave, General?

1247
01:34:45,475 --> 01:34:47,475
The same as last time, Lou.

1248
01:34:47,546 --> 01:34:50,236
They're going as fast as they can.

1249
01:34:55,047 --> 01:34:59,147
On your knees. On your knees!

1250
01:35:09,169 --> 01:35:12,399
Navy SEALs, listen up. You've got something that belongs to me.

1251
01:35:12,469 --> 01:35:14,959
Twelve guidance chips, to be precise.

1252
01:35:15,039 --> 01:35:19,699
Let me remind you there are lives at stake, civilian lives.

1253
01:35:19,780 --> 01:35:21,800
Speak up.

1254
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:23,070
Speak up!

1255
01:35:23,150 --> 01:35:25,980
Tell them your name.

1256
01:35:26,021 --> 01:35:28,821
My name is Larry Henderson.

1257
01:35:28,891 --> 01:35:33,081
-Oh, man.  -And I'm a father of three.

1258
01:35:33,092 --> 01:35:36,422
And, uh, they've got a gun to my head.

1259
01:35:36,492 --> 01:35:39,942
You've got exactly three minutes to return the guidance chips to the exercise yard...

1260
01:35:39,952 --> 01:35:41,672
or Mr. Henderson won't have a head.

1261
01:35:41,703 --> 01:35:43,133
Oh, no.

1262
01:35:47,013 --> 01:35:52,503
Now, three to go. You find them and defuse them, okay?

1263
01:35:53,684 --> 01:35:55,274
-All right.  -All right.

1264
01:35:55,354 --> 01:35:58,984
I'll try and delay Hummel and give you more time.

1265
01:35:59,055 --> 01:36:02,285
Hey, what about Mr. Henderson's head?

1266
01:36:04,896 --> 01:36:06,236
Okay?

1267
01:36:06,266 --> 01:36:07,866
What do you mean?

1268
01:36:12,767 --> 01:36:15,527
Okay.

1269
01:36:26,958 --> 01:36:29,428
General.

1270
01:36:29,459 --> 01:36:31,049
Who the hell are you?

1271
01:36:32,859 --> 01:36:35,229
I'm all that's left of the enemy.

1272
01:36:48,911 --> 01:36:50,911
Bingo.

1273
01:36:59,993 --> 01:37:02,083
Stand easy.

1274
01:37:05,593 --> 01:37:08,763
Thought I'd been in the service a long time.

1275
01:37:08,834 --> 01:37:11,244
Name and rank, sailor.

1276
01:37:11,274 --> 01:37:13,164
Well, it's army, actually.

1277
01:37:13,204 --> 01:37:18,004
Answer the question. And address him as "General, sir."

1278
01:37:18,015 --> 01:37:24,075
Captain John Patrick Mason, General, sir...of Her Majesty's S.A.S.

1279
01:37:24,386 --> 01:37:26,086
Retired, of course.

1280
01:37:29,726 --> 01:37:33,316
You're a long way from home, Captain.

1281
01:37:33,397 --> 01:37:35,287
How the hell are you involved in this?

1282
01:37:35,297 --> 01:37:37,587
Oh, I have a unique knowledge of this prison facility.

1283
01:37:37,637 --> 01:37:40,297
I was, uh, formerly a guest here.

1284
01:37:55,420 --> 01:37:57,550
Hi, sweetie.

1285
01:38:04,801 --> 01:38:06,861
Hey, come back here, little boy.

1286
01:38:08,671 --> 01:38:11,311
Did they bother to tell you who I am, why I'm doing this?

1287
01:38:11,342 --> 01:38:13,952
Or are they just using you like they do everybody else?

1288
01:38:13,962 --> 01:38:17,612
All I know is you were big in Vietnam. I saw the highlights on television.

1289
01:38:17,683 --> 01:38:21,053
Then you wouldn't have any fuckin' idea what it means to lead some of the finest men...

1290
01:38:21,063 --> 01:38:24,353
on God's earth into battle, and then see their memory betrayed by their own fuckin' government.

1291
01:38:24,423 --> 01:38:27,613
I don't quite see how you cherish the memory of the dead...

1292
01:38:27,694 --> 01:38:30,454
by killing another million.

1293
01:38:30,524 --> 01:38:33,694
And, uh, this is not combat.

1294
01:38:33,765 --> 01:38:38,065
It's an act of lunacy, General, sir.

1295
01:38:38,135 --> 01:38:40,865
Personally, I think you're a fuckin' idiot.

1296
01:38:46,476 --> 01:38:51,196
"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants."

1297
01:38:51,217 --> 01:38:52,977
Thomas Jefferson.

1298
01:38:53,047 --> 01:38:58,047
"Patriotism is the virtue of the vicious," according to Oscar Wilde.

1299
01:39:02,998 --> 01:39:04,898
Thank you for making my point.

1300
01:39:04,929 --> 01:39:07,729
Where are the guidance chips?

1301
01:39:07,799 --> 01:39:10,199
Where are the guidance chips?

1302
01:39:10,209 --> 01:39:11,749
I destroyed them.

1303
01:39:11,769 --> 01:39:14,269
That was a bad move, soldier.

1304
01:39:14,280 --> 01:39:16,870
Does that mean you'll execute us both?

1305
01:39:45,914 --> 01:39:48,324
You're lucky that old man Hummel wants you alive.

1306
01:39:48,334 --> 01:39:50,604
Cause I'll take pleasure in guttin' you, boy.

1307
01:39:57,455 --> 01:40:01,325
I'd take pleasure in guttin' you Boy

1308
01:40:02,426 --> 01:40:06,756
"I'll take pleasure in guttin' you, boy."

1309
01:40:08,137 --> 01:40:09,997
What is wrong with these people, huh, Mason?

1310
01:40:10,067 --> 01:40:14,237
Don't you think there's a lot of, uh, a lot of anger floatin' around this island?

1311
01:40:14,307 --> 01:40:17,087
Kind of a pubescent volatility? Don't you think?

1312
01:40:17,098 --> 01:40:21,908
A lot of angst, a lot of, " I'm 16, I'm angry at my father" syndrome?

1313
01:40:21,918 --> 01:40:24,028
I mean, grow up! We're stuck on an island...

1314
01:40:24,039 --> 01:40:27,349
with a bunch of violence-for-pleasure-seeking psychopathic marines.

1315
01:40:27,419 --> 01:40:30,089
Shame on them!

1316
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:36,090
Anyway, I only got one chem round. There's two left.

1317
01:40:36,170 --> 01:40:37,110
Mason?

1318
01:40:37,130 --> 01:40:40,100
Yes, I'm here.

1319
01:40:40,171 --> 01:40:42,731
I was just thinking how wonderful it was...

1320
01:40:42,811 --> 01:40:45,211
when the inmates weren't allowed to talk in here.

1321
01:40:45,281 --> 01:40:48,011
Not allowed to talk.

1322
01:40:48,082 --> 01:40:50,242
How'd you do it?

1323
01:40:50,312 --> 01:40:54,582
Uh, nurtured the hope that there was hope.

1324
01:40:54,593 --> 01:40:58,753
That one day I'd breathe free air.

1325
01:40:58,763 --> 01:41:02,123
Perhaps meet my daughter.

1326
01:41:02,194 --> 01:41:07,104
Modest hopes, but, uh, they kept a man alive.

1327
01:41:07,164 --> 01:41:10,334
What'd they put you away for, John?

1328
01:41:10,405 --> 01:41:13,435
Oh, that's a long story.

1329
01:41:13,505 --> 01:41:16,445
Well, I'm not goin' anywhere.

1330
01:41:16,515 --> 01:41:19,605
When was the last communication from our men on Alcatraz?

1331
01:41:19,686 --> 01:41:21,376
Seven hours.

1332
01:41:23,916 --> 01:41:26,216
Thermite plasma is operational.

1333
01:41:26,287 --> 01:41:28,437
Get me the president.

1334
01:41:28,457 --> 01:41:33,207
Be seated. Gentlemen, consider yourselves on ground alert. If we receive launch authority...

1335
01:41:33,218 --> 01:41:37,568
your mission is the complete thermal destruction of Alcatraz Island.

1336
01:41:37,638 --> 01:41:41,098
The entire island is to be blanketed, not one square inch missed.

1337
01:41:41,179 --> 01:41:44,009
Eighty-one American civilians and a number of U.S. Marines...

1338
01:41:44,079 --> 01:41:46,439
will lose their lives in this air strike.

1339
01:41:48,279 --> 01:41:50,879
Why didn't you just tell them where the microfilm was...

1340
01:41:50,950 --> 01:41:53,850
and, and create a solution?

1341
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:58,590
Hmph. The moment they had the microfilm, they'd suicide me.

1342
01:41:58,601 --> 01:42:00,631
Some solution.

1343
01:42:00,661 --> 01:42:02,651
And you ended up here.

1344
01:42:02,731 --> 01:42:06,841
Which brings me to another question. When you broke out...

1345
01:42:06,852 --> 01:42:10,012
Let me see if I can get this straight. You went down the incinerator chute...

1346
01:42:10,022 --> 01:42:12,442
on the mine cars, through the tunnels...

1347
01:42:12,473 --> 01:42:15,603
to the power plant.

1348
01:42:15,613 --> 01:42:20,113
under the steam engine... That was really cool, by the way...

1349
01:42:20,184 --> 01:42:22,744
and into the cistern through the intake pipe.

1350
01:42:22,824 --> 01:42:28,414
But how, in the name of Zeus's butthole...

1351
01:42:28,425 --> 01:42:31,325
did you get out of your cell?

1352
01:42:31,335 --> 01:42:34,125
I only ask because in our current situation...

1353
01:42:34,195 --> 01:42:39,465
well, it could prove to be useful information, maybe!

1354
01:42:57,688 --> 01:43:00,788
Trade secrets, my son.

1355
01:43:03,399 --> 01:43:05,829
General, two operational rockets left.

1356
01:43:05,899 --> 01:43:07,629
One's at the lower lighthouse and there is one on the roof.

1357
01:43:07,700 --> 01:43:10,760
And both of the birds are ready to fly, sir.

1358
01:43:10,840 --> 01:43:12,350
G-General, can you hear me?

1359
01:43:12,380 --> 01:43:14,140
I heard you, Captain.

1360
01:43:14,210 --> 01:43:16,810
Oh, just makin' sure.

1361
01:43:16,881 --> 01:43:21,511
Should we prepare for launch, General?

1362
01:43:21,591 --> 01:43:23,681
I'll handle the strategy, Captain.

1363
01:43:23,692 --> 01:43:26,882
Yes, sir.

1364
01:43:26,892 --> 01:43:28,462
The hour is approaching, sir.

1365
01:43:28,492 --> 01:43:31,132
Just letting the General know of the time, sir.

1366
01:43:31,143 --> 01:43:33,173
I'm very aware of the time, Captain.

1367
01:43:33,203 --> 01:43:35,303
Aye, aye, sir. Lettin' you know.

1368
01:43:35,373 --> 01:43:38,033
Me and my boys are ready to cock, lock, and ready to rock.

1369
01:43:39,974 --> 01:43:41,734
Mason, where're you going?

1370
01:43:41,744 --> 01:43:45,004
Thirty years ago I vowed I wouldn't die in this toilet.

1371
01:43:45,084 --> 01:43:46,114
You're not leaving!

1372
01:43:46,144 --> 01:43:50,514
There's a madman in there with his hand on a, on a button!

1373
01:43:50,585 --> 01:43:53,815
Shh. Some sniper's gonna get his ass.

1374
01:43:54,356 --> 01:43:57,616
Stop moving, Mason.

1375
01:43:57,626 --> 01:44:00,016
Mason, stop moving.

1376
01:44:00,026 --> 01:44:04,426
Hummel won't do it. He's a soldier, not a murderer.

1377
01:44:04,497 --> 01:44:05,837
I read it in his eyes.

1378
01:44:05,867 --> 01:44:08,067
You read his eyes?

1379
01:44:08,077 --> 01:44:09,837
Oh, well, then, everything's just fine!

1380
01:44:09,848 --> 01:44:11,648
I can't afford to take that chance.

1381
01:44:11,678 --> 01:44:13,378
Why don't you talk louder?

1382
01:44:13,878 --> 01:44:17,708
Three minutes to go, sir.

1383
01:44:17,779 --> 01:44:20,849
-They're not gonna call, Frank.  -Oh, they'll call.

1384
01:44:20,859 --> 01:44:24,109
They'll call if we fire one of our rockets up their ass.

1385
01:44:31,470 --> 01:44:32,590
Hummel.

1386
01:44:32,630 --> 01:44:34,800
Hi, Frank. It's Al Kramer here.

1387
01:44:34,901 --> 01:44:35,441
How's it going out there?

1388
01:44:35,471 --> 01:44:36,641
How do you think it's goin'?

1389
01:44:36,651 --> 01:44:39,091
Listen, on this end we're gonna need another hour, Frank.

1390
01:44:39,141 --> 01:44:40,831
You've got three minutes.

1391
01:44:40,911 --> 01:44:43,881
Listen, uh, Frank, we have to get final authorization from the president.

1392
01:44:43,942 --> 01:44:45,762
You've got three minutes.

1393
01:44:45,772 --> 01:44:48,482
Frank, please don't do anything stupid.

1394
01:44:51,083 --> 01:44:53,053
They want another hour.

1395
01:44:53,123 --> 01:44:56,493
Well, that's bullshit. That's bullshit, General. They're lyin'!

1396
01:44:56,563 --> 01:44:58,653
They're calling our bluff, sir.

1397
01:44:58,734 --> 01:45:01,824
They're playing you for a fool, sir.

1398
01:45:01,834 --> 01:45:05,934
Order the launch, General.

1399
01:45:06,005 --> 01:45:07,845
Come on, General.

1400
01:45:07,875 --> 01:45:09,595
Let's be all we can be.

1401
01:45:23,957 --> 01:45:26,087
The mission's not complete!

1402
01:45:26,157 --> 01:45:28,097
Well, mine is.

1403
01:45:28,167 --> 01:45:30,997
When this is over, you'll go back home...

1404
01:45:31,068 --> 01:45:36,098
driving Carla and your baby insane in your beige Volvo.

1405
01:45:36,169 --> 01:45:39,839
And I'll be dead or back in prison, which is the same thing.

1406
01:45:39,909 --> 01:45:42,039
You're not leaving.

1407
01:45:46,450 --> 01:45:50,550
All right, I'll do it myself.

1408
01:45:51,390 --> 01:45:54,150
I got three weeks' weapons training.

1409
01:45:54,221 --> 01:45:58,161
I'll kick the... Out of a platoon full of marines.

1410
01:45:58,231 --> 01:46:01,061
No problem.

1411
01:46:12,183 --> 01:46:15,783
-Major, patch me into Roof Battery.  -Aye, sir.

1412
01:46:15,854 --> 01:46:19,344
Fire open control circuit coordinates to the roof, sir.

1413
01:46:20,054 --> 01:46:21,814
Let's go!

1414
01:46:27,125 --> 01:46:28,885
Laser powered up!

1415
01:46:28,895 --> 01:46:31,915
Oh, no.

1416
01:46:31,936 --> 01:46:34,296
I said, on your knees!

1417
01:46:34,306 --> 01:46:36,006
My name's Stanley Goodspeed.

1418
01:46:36,036 --> 01:46:39,506
I'm a chemical weapons specialist for the FBI.

1419
01:46:39,577 --> 01:46:40,577
Uh, glass or plastic?

1420
01:46:40,607 --> 01:46:41,567
What?

1421
01:46:41,647 --> 01:46:43,017
Glass or plastic? Glass or plastic?

1422
01:46:43,047 --> 01:46:44,277
Shut the fuck up!

1423
01:46:44,347 --> 01:46:47,077
Because if the winds change after you launch those rockets...

1424
01:46:47,148 --> 01:46:49,298
-we're all gonna die.  -Shut up!

1425
01:46:49,308 --> 01:46:53,318
And you're gonna end up in either a glass jar or a plastic bag.

1426
01:46:53,388 --> 01:46:56,258
So, what do you say you do the math, h-hand over the gun...

1427
01:46:56,269 --> 01:46:57,839
and let's go find some rockets?

1428
01:46:57,859 --> 01:47:00,269
I said shut the fuck...

1429
01:47:08,380 --> 01:47:09,790
You made the right choice.

1430
01:47:09,800 --> 01:47:11,820
I decided I didn't want your child...

1431
01:47:11,851 --> 01:47:13,011
growing up without a father.

1432
01:47:14,751 --> 01:47:18,201
Hey, the last time I swam this channel I was your age.

1433
01:47:18,212 --> 01:47:20,622
So, I'm fucked either way. So, come on.

1434
01:47:20,632 --> 01:47:23,762
Weapon is hot. I am standing by for the launch command.

1435
01:47:23,822 --> 01:47:26,152
Man, killing Navy SEALs is one thing...

1436
01:47:26,163 --> 01:47:27,663
Is this for real?

1437
01:47:27,693 --> 01:47:30,123
Hey, it's business.

1438
01:47:32,333 --> 01:47:35,333
Access code entered. Weapon available for release.

1439
01:47:35,404 --> 01:47:38,374
Launch coordinates: Six, seven...

1440
01:47:38,444 --> 01:47:41,644
five, four, five, niner.

1441
01:47:43,485 --> 01:47:48,215
The weapon is hot. I'm standing by for launch command.

1442
01:47:48,285 --> 01:47:50,315
That's affirmative.

1443
01:47:56,996 --> 01:47:59,486
Standing by for command.

1444
01:48:07,438 --> 01:48:10,038
I'm waiting for launch command, General.

1445
01:48:18,719 --> 01:48:21,049
-Fire.  -Fire!

1446
01:48:25,490 --> 01:48:28,330
Missile loose! Missile loose!

1447
01:48:33,841 --> 01:48:38,431
Origin: Alcatraz, 67253725.

1448
01:48:38,512 --> 01:48:42,572
-What's the goddamn heading?  -Heading 185 degrees south southeast.

1449
01:48:42,652 --> 01:48:43,242
Speed?

1450
01:48:43,252 --> 01:48:45,012
Three hundred knots. It's headed right at Oakland.

1451
01:48:46,323 --> 01:48:49,483
Football game.

1452
01:48:51,823 --> 01:48:53,653
Oh, my God.

1453
01:49:16,587 --> 01:49:18,877
Missile radically changing direction.

1454
01:49:24,758 --> 01:49:27,738
New direction: 275 degrees west.

1455
01:49:27,768 --> 01:49:29,198
It's headed out to sea, sir.

1456
01:49:30,598 --> 01:49:32,928
Oh, Christ!

1457
01:49:33,009 --> 01:49:35,409
Missile losing altitude. Falling.

1458
01:49:35,419 --> 01:49:40,449
Falling, 300 feet, 200, 100.

1459
01:49:43,650 --> 01:49:46,550
Bogey detonated under water.

1460
01:49:49,761 --> 01:49:50,981
What the fuck?

1461
01:49:51,121 --> 01:49:53,491
It missed.

1462
01:49:53,561 --> 01:49:55,721
-Well, that's great.  -Extremely great.

1463
01:49:55,732 --> 01:49:58,092
But there's still one left.

1464
01:49:58,162 --> 01:50:01,862
What happened to the rocket? What the fuck happened to the coordinates?

1465
01:50:01,932 --> 01:50:05,502
What the fuck is going on? Sir! Major!

1466
01:50:05,573 --> 01:50:08,883
-Captain, step outside.  -Talk to me, sir.

1467
01:50:08,893 --> 01:50:10,633
Captain, step outside!

1468
01:50:24,095 --> 01:50:26,355
Get me the Pentagon.

1469
01:50:39,847 --> 01:50:43,347
What the hell was that, Frank?

1470
01:50:43,418 --> 01:50:45,988
-I said, what the hell...  -I heard what you said!

1471
01:50:46,038 --> 01:50:50,218
If you're gonna be insubordinate. I'd appreciate it if you'd do it with a little more respect.

1472
01:50:50,249 --> 01:50:50,769
Cut the crap, General.

1473
01:50:50,779 --> 01:50:52,229
-What the hell are you doing?  -I'm not ready to kill these people.

1474
01:50:52,289 --> 01:50:53,149
Call the Pentagon. Ask for more time.

1475
01:50:53,159 --> 01:50:54,349
No!

1476
01:50:54,429 --> 01:50:57,519
Do it, Frank! We're coming loose.

1477
01:50:57,600 --> 01:51:00,730
You're coming loose. The rest of us are in complete control.

1478
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:03,100
We're askin' 'em. We're askin' 'em for a new deadline.

1479
01:51:03,110 --> 01:51:03,770
Put the phone down.

1480
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:05,740
-The men are falling apart.  -The men are marines!

1481
01:51:05,811 --> 01:51:09,441
Are they?

1482
01:51:09,511 --> 01:51:12,051
-I wanna talk to General Kramer.  -You've been asked by an old friend.

1483
01:51:12,061 --> 01:51:14,811
-Put him on the phone right now.  -You've been ordered by a superior officer.

1484
01:51:14,822 --> 01:51:15,502
This is Major Baxter.

1485
01:51:15,512 --> 01:51:16,992
Now you're being given your last chance by a man with a gun.

1486
01:51:17,042 --> 01:51:18,382
Put the phone down.

1487
01:51:23,593 --> 01:51:25,103
I thought you weren't ready to kill.

1488
01:51:25,133 --> 01:51:27,153
I'm warmin' up.

1489
01:51:28,463 --> 01:51:30,403
At ease.

1490
01:51:38,915 --> 01:51:41,545
They need a decision, Mr. President.

1491
01:51:50,596 --> 01:51:53,156
These past few hours...

1492
01:51:53,227 --> 01:51:57,067
have been the longest, darkest of my life.

1493
01:51:57,137 --> 01:52:00,857
How does one weigh human life?

1494
01:52:00,868 --> 01:52:04,898
One million civilians against 81 hostages.

1495
01:52:05,378 --> 01:52:08,608
And in the middle, Frank Hummel.

1496
01:52:09,519 --> 01:52:17,119
That we have ignored, abandoned or marginalized a great soldier like Frank Hummel...

1497
01:52:17,190 --> 01:52:22,130
and that American boys have paid for that neglect in blood...

1498
01:52:22,140 --> 01:52:26,430
is equally real and equally tragic.

1499
01:52:28,701 --> 01:52:31,831
We are at war with terror.

1500
01:52:31,842 --> 01:52:34,372
Fighting a war means casualties.

1501
01:52:34,382 --> 01:52:38,302
This is the worst call I've ever had to make.

1502
01:52:41,883 --> 01:52:45,043
Air strike approved.

1503
01:52:48,194 --> 01:52:50,184
Red Thunder to tower. Request clearance.

1504
01:52:51,164 --> 01:52:53,324
With the amount of firepower they're gonna drop in there...

1505
01:52:53,334 --> 01:52:54,954
Tower this is Strike Leader. Prepared to go.

1506
01:52:54,995 --> 01:52:57,365
It'll be over in a few seconds.

1507
01:52:57,435 --> 01:52:59,835
Flight time to drop point: 17 minutes.

1508
01:53:06,306 --> 01:53:09,356
Excuse me, General, sir, with all due respect to you.

1509
01:53:09,416 --> 01:53:11,116
But what the fuck is going on?

1510
01:53:11,187 --> 01:53:12,657
You changed the coordinates, didn't you, General?

1511
01:53:12,717 --> 01:53:14,137
That's affirmative, Captain.

1512
01:53:14,147 --> 01:53:18,307
So, now they think we're gutless, the Feds? They think we won't actually do it.

1513
01:53:18,317 --> 01:53:20,907
They're gonna come at us with everything they've got. Air and sea.

1514
01:53:20,918 --> 01:53:22,828
They're gonna bomb our ass back to the Stone Age.

1515
01:53:22,858 --> 01:53:25,758
They don't know we missed on purpose.

1516
01:53:25,768 --> 01:53:30,128
Great. We're not gutless, we're incompetent.

1517
01:53:30,169 --> 01:53:31,569
That right?

1518
01:53:31,639 --> 01:53:35,089
I don't think I like your tone, Captain. We planned for this contingency.

1519
01:53:35,100 --> 01:53:38,190
Load the V.X. Into the choppers, take four hostages and evacuate.

1520
01:53:38,210 --> 01:53:40,180
The consequences of our actions I'll face alone.

1521
01:53:40,250 --> 01:53:43,780
Excuse me, General, but what about the fucking money?

1522
01:53:43,851 --> 01:53:46,341
There is no fucking money. Mission's over.

1523
01:53:46,421 --> 01:53:47,621
Bullshit it's over.

1524
01:53:47,631 --> 01:53:51,921
You're talking to a General, soldier. Maintain discipline.

1525
01:53:51,932 --> 01:53:53,322
I'm not a soldier, Major.

1526
01:53:53,332 --> 01:53:56,032
The day we took hostages we became mercenaries.

1527
01:53:56,062 --> 01:53:58,832
And mercenaries get paid!

1528
01:53:58,903 --> 01:54:01,533
I want my fucking money!

1529
01:54:01,603 --> 01:54:04,353
This mission was based on the threat of force.

1530
01:54:04,363 --> 01:54:09,503
I'm not about to kill 80,000 innocent people. Do you think I'm out of my fucking mind?

1531
01:54:11,384 --> 01:54:12,724
We bluffed. They called it.

1532
01:54:12,754 --> 01:54:14,574
The mission's over.

1533
01:54:18,395 --> 01:54:21,615
Whoever said anything about bluffing, General?

1534
01:54:21,626 --> 01:54:23,626
Stand down, Captain.

1535
01:54:27,536 --> 01:54:30,536
Stand down, Captain!

1536
01:54:36,507 --> 01:54:39,417
Major, I'm ordering you to take these men to the choppers and evacuate.

1537
01:54:41,718 --> 01:54:43,998
That's a simple order, Major!

1538
01:54:44,018 --> 01:54:46,518
It's not so simple, Frank.

1539
01:54:46,589 --> 01:54:49,059
Sergeant Crisp...

1540
01:54:49,129 --> 01:54:51,419
secure the General.

1541
01:54:51,429 --> 01:54:54,399
I'm relieving you of your command, sir.

1542
01:54:58,040 --> 01:55:00,960
Sergeant!

1543
01:55:07,181 --> 01:55:11,311
-I'll have that sidearm, sir.  -You mean this sidearm?

1544
01:55:19,493 --> 01:55:22,983
Major Baxter, you're either with us or against us.

1545
01:55:27,904 --> 01:55:31,734
It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve with you, General.

1546
01:55:36,015 --> 01:55:39,575
But like he said...

1547
01:55:40,086 --> 01:55:43,546
it's over.

1548
01:55:58,968 --> 01:56:01,628
Let's get him.

1549
01:56:05,949 --> 01:56:09,379
Mason!

1550
01:56:11,420 --> 01:56:12,680
My God, what have I done?

1551
01:56:12,720 --> 01:56:13,810
Where's the last rocket?

1552
01:56:14,290 --> 01:56:15,980
Where's the last rocket?

1553
01:56:18,991 --> 01:56:20,131
Where's the last rocket?

1554
01:56:20,161 --> 01:56:21,221
Lower lighthouse.

1555
01:56:21,231 --> 01:56:24,761
-Lower lighthouse.  Go!

1556
01:56:37,013 --> 01:56:40,883
Darrow, go to the lighthouse. I'll take care of this fucker!

1557
01:56:47,154 --> 01:56:51,424
One, two, three! Eat that!

1558
01:57:05,076 --> 01:57:07,266
Did it.

1559
01:57:38,321 --> 01:57:39,291
Come here.

1560
01:57:39,321 --> 01:57:42,031
Come here, you little chicken shit!

1561
01:57:42,041 --> 01:57:46,191
You shoot me, I drop this. We're both dead.

1562
01:57:46,262 --> 01:57:48,522
Well, come on. Come on. Don't be scared. I won't hurt ya.

1563
01:57:48,592 --> 01:57:51,222
-Come on.  -Do you know how this shit works?

1564
01:57:51,232 --> 01:57:53,062
You know how this shit works?

1565
01:57:56,103 --> 01:57:58,333
Come on. Come on.

1566
01:57:58,343 --> 01:58:01,333
I don't need the gun. I'll put it down.

1567
01:58:01,344 --> 01:58:05,334
Come on. Let's play. Come on. Come on.

1568
01:58:05,344 --> 01:58:07,454
Listen, I think we got started off on the wrong foot.

1569
01:58:07,484 --> 01:58:09,964
Stan Goodspeed, FBI. Uh...

1570
01:58:09,975 --> 01:58:11,355
Let's talk music.

1571
01:58:11,385 --> 01:58:14,325
Do you like the Elton John song, "Rocket Man"?

1572
01:58:14,335 --> 01:58:16,015
I don't like soft-ass shit.

1573
01:58:16,025 --> 01:58:18,315
Oh, you... Oh, oh. Oh.

1574
01:58:18,326 --> 01:58:22,326
Well, I only bring it up because, uh, it's you.

1575
01:58:22,396 --> 01:58:24,956
You're the Rocket Man.

1576
01:58:26,607 --> 01:58:28,467
No!

1577
01:58:29,637 --> 01:58:32,697
How do you like how that shit works?

1578
01:58:32,748 --> 01:58:34,678
Second rocket's away!

1579
01:58:41,719 --> 01:58:44,579
It splashed into the bay, sir. No detonation.

1580
01:58:45,889 --> 01:58:48,329
Shit!

1581
01:59:08,322 --> 01:59:09,812
Darrow!

1582
01:59:09,822 --> 01:59:12,612
Open up!

1583
01:59:15,393 --> 01:59:16,483
Come on.

1584
01:59:16,493 --> 01:59:18,893
Open up!

1585
01:59:46,757 --> 01:59:50,457
Hey, you mother!

1586
02:00:23,432 --> 02:00:26,562
Oh, I'm gonna get you now, baby.

1587
02:00:33,643 --> 02:00:36,513
I got ya. I got you, baby.

1588
02:00:37,854 --> 02:00:40,114
Come on.

1589
02:00:55,476 --> 02:00:57,576
Fucker!

1590
02:01:23,669 --> 02:01:26,089
Red Thunder Strike Leader.

1591
02:01:26,100 --> 02:01:28,740
Time on target: Seven minutes.

1592
02:01:45,262 --> 02:01:47,002
English prick.

1593
02:01:47,032 --> 02:01:48,962
I tell you my old man was Irish?

1594
02:01:51,833 --> 02:01:54,603
Maintain air speed 450 knots.

1595
02:02:00,244 --> 02:02:02,974
Fuck!

1596
02:02:20,567 --> 02:02:23,397
It's me and you, pal.

1597
02:02:23,467 --> 02:02:25,937
I want that fucking chip!

1598
02:02:35,349 --> 02:02:38,249
I love pressure.

1599
02:02:45,460 --> 02:02:48,460
I know you're in here, and I know you can hear me.

1600
02:02:48,530 --> 02:02:50,970
Now, pay the piper and come out like a man.

1601
02:03:19,904 --> 02:03:22,394
Increase speed to 500 knots.

1602
02:03:22,405 --> 02:03:25,765
You motherfucker! Die!

1603
02:03:29,745 --> 02:03:37,455
I'm gonna choke my million bucks out of you. You're gonna die. Eat that, you fuck!

1604
02:04:05,050 --> 02:04:08,310
All right, team, inbound. Time on target: 60 seconds.

1605
02:04:13,331 --> 02:04:17,351
Come to course heading 142 degrees.

1606
02:04:24,272 --> 02:04:26,922
When he neutralizes the threat...

1607
02:04:26,933 --> 02:04:30,443
we launch green flares and we wait for the cavalry.

1608
02:04:35,124 --> 02:04:36,424
Let's tighten up that formation.

1609
02:04:36,454 --> 02:04:38,854
May God have mercy on your souls.

1610
02:04:38,924 --> 02:04:42,124
Please don't let this happen. There has to be something you can do. Please.

1611
02:04:52,776 --> 02:04:55,836
Let's drop to the deck. One hundred feet below radar.

1612
02:05:05,388 --> 02:05:08,358
Target acquired. Rolling in.

1613
02:05:11,729 --> 02:05:15,689
This is Red Thunder. Master armed. Master armed.

1614
02:05:16,169 --> 02:05:19,529
Time on target: 12 seconds.

1615
02:05:22,010 --> 02:05:25,170
T.O. T: Ten seconds.

1616
02:05:28,681 --> 02:05:31,181
Stay tight, gentlemen.

1617
02:05:33,991 --> 02:05:36,021
I got green smoke. I got green smoke!

1618
02:05:36,032 --> 02:05:39,322
This is C.Q. One, C.Q. One! Green smoke! We have green smoke! Over.

1619
02:05:39,392 --> 02:05:41,162
Eh, gimme that!  Gimme that! Abort!

1620
02:05:41,172 --> 02:05:43,052
Flight leader, abort, abort, abort!

1621
02:05:43,093 --> 02:05:44,463
Jesus Chri...

1622
02:05:45,863 --> 02:05:49,363
I already dropped them!

1623
02:05:58,344 --> 02:06:02,374
-Oh, goddamn it!  -Oh, my God!

1624
02:06:05,055 --> 02:06:08,085
Get out of my way. Let me through, please. Let me through!

1625
02:06:11,466 --> 02:06:16,426
The cells did not get hit. The bombs hit on the back of the island.

1626
02:06:38,290 --> 02:06:43,890
I'm fed up saving your ass. I'm amazed you ever got past puberty.

1627
02:06:43,900 --> 02:06:48,080
I suppose all this will make a great bedtime story to tell your kid.

1628
02:06:48,091 --> 02:06:51,361
You're insane, Mason. The kid'll have nightmares.

1629
02:06:51,411 --> 02:06:53,971
Spend all my money on shrinks.

1630
02:06:54,312 --> 02:06:56,272
Goodspeed, come in.

1631
02:06:56,282 --> 02:06:59,472
Goodspeed, Goodspeed, do you read me? Come in!

1632
02:06:59,482 --> 02:07:01,192
Scanning all radio frequencies.

1633
02:07:01,222 --> 02:07:04,012
Goodspeed, do you read me? Come in!

1634
02:07:05,053 --> 02:07:08,993
Goodspeed, do you read me? Come in!

1635
02:07:13,294 --> 02:07:17,154
Goodspeed, do you read me? Come in!

1636
02:07:17,165 --> 02:07:20,705
This is Goodspeed.

1637
02:07:21,345 --> 02:07:24,715
Are the hostages alive?

1638
02:07:24,745 --> 02:07:26,745
Every one of 'em.

1639
02:07:28,846 --> 02:07:35,186
Goodspeed, it's Womack. What about Mason?

1640
02:07:42,328 --> 02:07:43,418
He's dead, sir.

1641
02:07:43,468 --> 02:07:44,698
How? When?

1642
02:07:44,708 --> 02:07:47,428
Just come and get me.

1643
02:07:49,909 --> 02:07:53,049
Womack tore up your pardon, John.

1644
02:07:53,059 --> 02:07:55,159
But, of course. I knew he would.

1645
02:07:55,169 --> 02:07:58,399
The S.D.U. S and the scuba gear should still be where we came ashore.

1646
02:07:58,410 --> 02:08:01,840
If you can get to the Pan Pacific Hotel, there's clothes in my closet...

1647
02:08:01,890 --> 02:08:04,020
$200 in the Bible.

1648
02:08:04,030 --> 02:08:06,110
Room 26.

1649
02:08:06,121 --> 02:08:11,181
Well, it's been a long time since I've said thank you to anybody.

1650
02:08:12,132 --> 02:08:15,862
But thank you.

1651
02:08:15,872 --> 02:08:22,302
Well, Stanley, uh, this is when we go our separate ways, huh?

1652
02:08:22,373 --> 02:08:26,943
But, uh, I'm sure you know the etymology of your name "Goodspeed."

1653
02:08:27,013 --> 02:08:31,213
Yeah, Godspeed: To wish someone a prosperous journey. Why?

1654
02:08:31,284 --> 02:08:34,244
Well, if you fancy a journey...

1655
02:08:34,254 --> 02:08:38,014
I recommend Fort Walton, Kansas.

1656
02:08:38,025 --> 02:08:41,295
I was thinking of Maui.

1657
02:08:46,506 --> 02:08:50,166
Forget Maui.

1658
02:08:55,517 --> 02:08:59,107
"St. Michael's Church, Fort Walton, Kansas.

1659
02:08:59,118 --> 02:09:04,018
"Front pew, right leg. Hollow."

1660
02:09:04,028 --> 02:09:07,858
Is this what I think it is?

1661
02:09:08,459 --> 02:09:12,459
Mason?

1662
02:09:25,081 --> 02:09:27,241
Congratulations, Dr. Goodspeed. You did it.

1663
02:09:27,281 --> 02:09:28,311
Thank you, sir.

1664
02:09:28,321 --> 02:09:31,981
You know, for a while there, I didn't think you were gonna make it.

1665
02:09:31,992 --> 02:09:33,982
Well done, son.

1666
02:09:33,992 --> 02:09:36,182
So, where's Mason?

1667
02:09:36,192 --> 02:09:37,782
Vaporized.

1668
02:09:37,832 --> 02:09:39,652
Blown out to sea.

1669
02:09:39,663 --> 02:09:42,023
Blown out to sea, huh?

1670
02:09:42,033 --> 02:09:45,363
Yeah.

1671
02:09:46,174 --> 02:09:50,504
Poor bastard.

1672
02:09:50,574 --> 02:09:55,574
Goodspeed, where's Mason? Where's his body? I wanna see that son of a bitch!

1673
02:09:55,585 --> 02:09:56,865
Vaporized, sir.

1674
02:09:56,915 --> 02:09:59,315
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1675
02:09:59,325 --> 02:10:03,115
What? Vaporized? A body can vaporize?

1676
02:10:03,126 --> 02:10:07,256
Oh, yeah! Absolutely, sir.

1677
02:10:09,296 --> 02:10:13,456
St. Michael's Church, front pew, right leg.

1678
02:10:13,467 --> 02:10:16,207
Front pew, right leg.

1679
02:10:16,217 --> 02:10:18,327
Vandals! Vandals!

1680
02:10:18,338 --> 02:10:20,108
Oh, yes, baby, come on!

1681
02:10:20,118 --> 02:10:22,138
Stop! Vandals! Stop!

1682
02:10:22,148 --> 02:10:24,238
I'm sorry!

1683
02:10:24,648 --> 02:10:25,138
Come on, baby!

1684
02:10:25,148 --> 02:10:27,008
I've got it! Okay, let's go!

1685
02:10:27,619 --> 02:10:30,919
-Stop! Stop!  -Sorry!

1686
02:10:31,589 --> 02:10:34,249
Stop! Hey, hey, you!

1687
02:10:35,330 --> 02:10:38,150
Vandals! Vandals!

1688
02:10:38,160 --> 02:10:40,840
Honey, uh...

1689
02:10:40,871 --> 02:10:50,992
you wanna know who really killed J.F.K?
