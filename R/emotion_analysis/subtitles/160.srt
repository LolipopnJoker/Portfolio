<i>Oh, this is just coming in.</i>

8
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:55,948
Hancock!

9
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,334
What, boy?

10
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:08,669
Bad guys.

11
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:11,297
<i>--trying to cut them off.</i>
<i>You can see them there.</i>

12
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,633
<i>They have their hands</i>
<i>outside the white SUV...</i>

13
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:17,386
<i>...shooting randomly on the freeway.</i>

14
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,598
What, you want a cookie?
Get out of my face.

15
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:22,767
Asshole.

16
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,770
-What?
-You heard me.

17
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:34,320
<i>Please, stay off the freeway.</i>

18
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:38,115
<i>l understand that there are</i>

19
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,909
Asshole.

20
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,234
Watch out!

21
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:15,653
Damn!

22
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,239
Damn it!

23
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,356
Hancock!?!

24
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,401
Beat it, 'Soulja Boy!'

25
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,612
<i>Hancock is in the car...</i>

26
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,281
<i>...and he appears to be</i>
<i>negotiating with the gunmen.</i>

27
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:02,825
He smells like a bar!

28
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:06,329
You pay for new roof!

29
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:10,333
Fellas, hey. l don't give a shit
what you did. l don't care.

30
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,211
Three guys in the car,
no girls, rave music.

31
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,880
Hey, I'm not gonna judge.

32
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:20,551
But if you don't pull over
and give yourselves up quietly...

33
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:25,181
...l swear to Christ, your head
is going up the driver's ass.

34
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:28,768
His head is going up your ass.
And you drew the short stick...

35
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:31,395
...because your head
is going up my ass.

36
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,523
Shoot this asshole!

37
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:40,655
Stop!

38
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:42,949
What the F%Ø#K?

39
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:59,340
<i>The department is on their way.</i>
<i>There's just chaos here on the 1 05.</i>

00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,064
What? l'm not Japanese, man!

41
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,273
Put us down!

42
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,735
Oh, now you "speaky Engly," huh?
"Speaky Engly" now?

43
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:33,416
You broke my glasses.

44
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,835
l'm sorry! Take my Ray-Bans!

45
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,130
-Put us down!
-You want down?

46
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,756
-Yes, please! Please!
-Help me!

47
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:44,385
l'm real good at down.
l'm real good at down.

48
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:45,886
All right? All right.

49
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:55,438
<i>This, Hancock's latest act</i>
<i>of so-called heroics...</i>

50
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,690
<i>...took a hefty financial toll.</i>

51
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:02,111
<i>lnitial damage estimates</i>
<i>are said to top $9 million...</i>

52
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,487
<i>...which, if accurate...</i>

53
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,823
<i>...represents a personal record...</i>

54
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:09,201
<i>...for the notoriously publicity-shy</i>
<i>Hancock...</i>

55
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:13,247
<i>...who, as usual,</i>
<i>can't be reached for comment.</i>

56
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:18,252
<i>With all the cracks to the concrete,</i>

59
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,459
Hi.

60
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:02,463
Don't think l'm crazy, okay?
We've looked everywhere for you.

61
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:06,300
Going to the Roxy
and the Viper Room and Jumbo's...

62
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:10,095
...anywhere we thought
you would be at. l found you.

63
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,681
l got you.

64
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,601
So, what's it like when you fly?

65
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:22,525
-No, what?
-l ain't gonna fly you.

66
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:26,153
l got a cousin, Narelle. She's my
best friend in the entire world...

67
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:29,615
...and l swear to God she would not
be here today if it wasn't for you.

68
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,619
She crashed her car up in Malibu
when you flew her to the hospital.

69
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,287
Remember?

70
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,332
l will break my foot off
in your ass, woman.

71
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:44,129
You got a car?

72
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,822
Hey, want a drink?

73
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:14,910
So this is where you live.
This is your hideout.

74
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,663
Your Batcave.

75
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,666
Your Fortress of Solitude.

76
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,921
-lt's a couple trailers l stuck together.
-What's all this?

77
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,758
-Jiffy Pop.
-Jiffy Pop.

78
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,553
-What do you do with it?
-Pop it.

79
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:35,723
-Jiffy Pop, pop. l like that.
-Hey, hey.

80
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:36,932
Hold on.

81
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,602
Want me to give you
something else to pop?

82
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,771
-l didn't catch your name.
-Pop this, Superman.

83
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:46,442
Not much for the chitchat, huh?
Let me set this over here.

84
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,652
-All right. Now, there are some rules.
-Hello?

85
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,280
-No, I know, l haven't seen it yet.
-Excuse me.

86
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,449
l know, probably. All right, all right.

87
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:55,534
-Let me call you back.
-Listen.

88
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,496
You're gonna need to focus.
All right, l need you--

89
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,374
-Hey, that's-- That's not focusing.
-What's in there?

90
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:06,629
Okay, all right, hold on.
Stop. Stop it. All right, now...

91
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:10,007
-...when I get to the moment....
-The moment?

92
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:15,054
You know, the-- Start climbing
the mountaintop, you know?

93
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,431
-You know.... All right? Yes.
-Yeah.

94
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:20,267
You're gonna need to be as far away
from that as possible.

95
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:22,728
-Far. That's hot.
-No, that's not hot. lt's not hot.

96
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,147
-Oh, yeah.
-Okay.

97
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:29,026
Hancock. Oh, yeah.

98
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:33,113
-Now you're doing too much.
-Hancock.

99
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,408
Oh, mountaintop! Mountaintop!

100
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,577
Mountaintop! Watch out!

101
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,392
Sorry.

102
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,272
That's not fair to anybody.

103
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,822
Thank you for being okay with that.

104
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,951
-l know it's....
-Can l use the bathroom, please?

105
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:22,413
Yeah. Hey, you--?
You want some Jiffy Pop?

106
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:26,041
-No, thanks.
-lt's straight back.

107
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,545
-You all right?
-Yeah.

108
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:31,922
Yeah, l was trying to tell you.

109
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,971
Hey....

110
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:49,148
Listen-- You know, if you want
l could fly you.

111
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:53,736
lt's really beautiful, you know?
Earth.

112
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,947
You could see the--

113
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:06,749
Might have to get you a helmet,
so your face doesn't tear off.

114
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,585
What do you think?

115
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,543
Sir? Ray Embrey.

116
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,045
-Ray.
-Pleasure.

117
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,632
-So....
-Ray's like the Bono of P.R.

118
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:00,928
Well, actually, I think Bono
is the Bono of P.R., but l do try.

119
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:02,763
Well, let's see it.

120
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:06,350
Okay. l'll get right into it.
Good morning, everyone.

121
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:10,062
l'm here to talk to you
about charitable giving.

122
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,439
Okay? And we all know
the way that works.

123
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:15,400
You give one, maybe two percent
of your net cash...

124
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:19,655
...and you get an armband, or a ribbon
or whatever. lt's nowhere near enough.

125
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:24,660
And that's why we at Embrey Publicity
would like to offer you...

126
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,829
...the AllHeart symbol.

127
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:32,626
Now, you would be among a very
select group of corporate giants...

128
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:36,171
...to bear this logo on your product.

129
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,340
And what this would say
to the public...

130
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:40,425
...is that your company,
Pharmatopsis...

131
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:44,972
...has made a radical contribution
to helping our world.

132
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,057
Here's all you need to do to qualify.

133
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:51,145
Your new TB drug, Mycodin?

134
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:54,439
We would like for you to give
that product away for free.

135
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:59,695
-Did you say "free"?
-l did.

136
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,740
Only to those who need it.

137
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:07,327
Only to those who without it
would otherwise die.

138
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:11,456
As a concept, free is kind of up there
with, you know, lethal side effects.

139
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,126
-Mandatory product recall.
-Get indicted, go to jail.

140
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:17,171
Get out, work at lHOP
for the rest of your career.

141
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,756
Understandable reaction.
lt's a radical concept.

142
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:24,261
But it is the brand that represents
a fairer and better world.

143
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:25,721
The brand...

144
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,516
...that everyone is talking about.

145
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,602
Who is "everyone"?

146
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,396
We do already have
a sports franchise.

147
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:37,608
-NFL? NBA? MLB?
-Soccer.

148
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,194
MLS? Which team?

149
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:43,405
Well, it's a local team.
Encino Hurricanes.

150
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,033
lt's my son's team.

151
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:50,287
Anyway, we can save the world.

152
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:53,790
All right?
Someone's just gotta go first.

153
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,418
What do you say?

154
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:00,631
Are you a crackpot?

155
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:12,309
Hey, hon. You're probably at the store.
l am on my way.

156
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:15,812
l think l made a connection.

157
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,190
Not really.

158
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,817
Listen, tell Aaron that l'm coming
and l-- Damn it.

159
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,237
And l want some meatballs, okay?

160
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:27,115
l need some Spaghetti Madness.
l'll see you in about 20 minutes.

161
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,827
Hey! What is it, National Horn Day?

162
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,538
ldiot.

163
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,961
Hey.

164
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,879
Hey. Hey!

165
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,215
Move it. There's a train coming.

166
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,634
Do you not hear that horn?

167
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,303
Let's go! l got a train!

168
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,264
Move it!

169
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,725
-Back your car up! There's a train!
-l can't go anywhere. Get out!

170
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,394
Son of a bitch!

171
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:59,481
Fix the handle, Ray. Fix the handle.

172
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:06,613
Get out!

173
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,413
Get off the track! Move!

174
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,424
-Let's get him out.
-Get him out of there.

175
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,801
-Somebody help him.
-You all right?

176
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:30,679
Please, that guy's still in there.

177
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,348
You sure?

178
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:36,184
Get him out of there!

179
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,276
Will you look at that?

180
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:09,968
-Ah, shit.
-l'm all right. l'm okay.

181
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,428
All of you people...

182
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,806
...blocking the intersection...

183
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,600
...you're all idiots.

184
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:19,895
You threw the dude's car at her.
And what's with the train?

185
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:23,440
Why didn't you just go straight up
in the air with the car?

186
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,360
You've obviously injured
that poor woman.

187
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:30,572
-She's right. She should sue you.
-Yeah, she should sue you.

188
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,617
Well, you should sue McDonald's
because they fucked you up.

189
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:36,161
You're an asshole.

190
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,663
And l can smell
that liquor on your breath.

191
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:42,000
-Because I've been drinking, bitch.
-You're a drunk asshole!

192
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:46,004
-You think you're such a hero.
-Asshole!

193
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:50,300
-You're nothing but an asshole.
-We don't need you in this city.

194
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:55,305
Some superhero you are! Fly off!

195
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:57,766
Shut up!

196
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,518
Don't you understand? l'm alive.

197
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:03,355
l get to go home and see my family.
l should be dead right now, right here.

198
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:06,483
Yeah, he could've gone straight up.
Obviously, you should've.

199
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:10,570
You know, and l was upside down
for the train, but....

200
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,949
No. Thank you.

201
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:17,202
Thank you very much, Hancock.
Thank you.

202
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,621
Thank you, Hancock.

203
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:26,378
You're not flying by the Valley,
are you?

204
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:32,592
Throw the ball!

205
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:36,638
Monte, one guy'll line up here,
all right? Hike the ball.

206
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,974
This guy'll be right here
and he says, "Hut!"

207
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:42,811
This guy'll drop back. Hut!
Drop back. Chuck it.

208
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,606
Great. Thank you.

209
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:49,317
Nice aim. The driveway
would've been better, but--

210
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,319
-What's going on, Dad?
-Hey, buddy.

211
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,114
Daddy's had a little bit of a day.
Look at you, huh?

212
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:55,615
l want you to meet somebody.

213
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:59,161
This guy here, dragging
Daddy's car into the driveway.

214
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,788
-Who's this?
-Hancock.

215
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:04,207
That's right. Hancock,
this is my boy, Aaron.

216
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,043
-Ray, what happened to the car?
-Oh, boy.

217
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:08,920
You would not have believed it.

218
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:13,091
l came this close to getting hit
by a train. lf it wasn't for that guy....

219
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:16,470
He saved my life. l mean--
Hancock, this is my wife, Mary.

220
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:20,724
Believe that? l almost kissed a train.
Saw my whole life flash before my eyes.

221
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:23,435
-He saved your life?
-He sure did. Thank you.

222
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,270
-Hey, you good?
-l am good, yeah.

223
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:29,774
-All right. Keep it off the tracks.
-l will, definitely.

224
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,530
Hang on a-- One second.

225
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:39,117
-Hancock, you eat, yes? Human food?
-Yeah.

226
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:40,619
-You like meatballs?
-No.

227
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,829
Aaron, sweetheart,
he has to go and do--

228
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:46,041
-l love meatballs.
-Who's so busy they can't have a meal?

229
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:47,709
And it's on us. Please.

230
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:51,338
l'm not even gonna take no
for an answer. Get inside the house.

231
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:19,074
Why do you have an eagle
on your hat?

232
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:21,993
Do you like eagles?

233
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:24,371
This guy's like a little
talking machine, huh?

234
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,498
We don't have a lot of guests
over here.

235
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,125
Look at that, huh?
Hon, is the heat on?

236
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,170
No? All right.

237
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:36,258
We started Spaghetti Madness
about two years ago.

238
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:40,136
We do it every Thursday, and we
have not missed a Thursday in....

239
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,555
-Ever.
-Yeah.

240
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,974
-Ever? That's a long time.
-Yes, sir.

241
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:47,143
-A very long time.
-That's some good meatballs, boy.

242
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:48,645
Aaron.

243
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:50,730
-Your mama's calling you.
-Yes, Mom?

244
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,233
No. His name is Aaron.

245
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:56,528
-Hey, Aaron, how was school today?
-Fine.

246
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:59,406
Yeah? No more problems
with that bully, Michael?

247
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:02,909
-Michel. But not like a girl's name.
-Michel. No, no, l know.

248
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:05,620
-lt's French.
-Yeah. Michel, Hancock, is this--

249
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:09,165
Hancock? Michel
is this neighbourhood bully.

250
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,501
We've been trying to teach Aaron
a little...

251
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:14,379
...about conflict resolution.
You know what l mean?

252
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:18,258
-Yeah. Turn the other cheek, all that?
-That's exactly right.

253
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:21,803
Well, just never turn that one,
all right?

254
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,346
Never let them punk you.

255
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:25,140
-Got it, Mr. Hancock.
-Aaron, eat.

256
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:28,810
The way you deal with bullies,
you take your right foot...

257
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,896
...bring it right up and catch him
in his little piss pump.

258
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,441
You don't have to do that, honey, okay?
Seriously.

259
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:35,650
lt's a good idea.

260
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:38,695
You aim straight and make sure
he can't use that thing...

261
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:41,990
...for nothing but a flap to keep
the dust out of his butt crack.

262
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:43,617
Okay, please, just stop.

263
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,535
Michel is not a man, okay?

264
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,495
He's a little boy. And his parents...

265
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:51,207
...happen to be going through a bad
divorce. That's why he's acting up.

266
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,709
Maybe you don't know this...

267
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:56,004
...but not everything in this world
gets resolved with force.

268
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,214
-Not everything has to be bang...
-l'm set.

269
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:03,219
-...scream, blood, more blood.
-Baby, l got plenty. Angel! We're okay.

270
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,804
She watches so much news...

271
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,557
...that sometimes
it gets to be a little too much.

272
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:11,186
-You got a toilet?
-Yep. Yeah, just past the fridge.

273
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,316
Are--?

274
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:22,364
Did he just take the whisky bottle
to the bathroom?

275
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,032
Do you want him to kill us all?

276
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,201
Thanks for coming on in.
Good, right?

277
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:28,536
-Very, yeah.
-Wanna say goodbye to him?

278
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,997
-Bye, Hancock.
-Hey, all right, little buddy.

279
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,293
-Are you okay?
-lt was a joke.

280
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:38,004
-Come on, Aaron.
-Hey, sorry. l was just trying to--

281
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:39,589
He got it. She didn't get it.

282
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:42,175
l owe you.
You gave me my life back today.

283
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:44,386
Hear me out.
l'd like to return the favour.

284
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:47,263
Do you know what l do?
l'm in public relations.

285
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:51,059
You know what that is? Of course
you do. We're image consultants.

286
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:54,604
We change the way people see
products, companies, people, that stuff.

287
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:57,774
Listen, l see you on the news
and l see you out there today...

288
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:01,444
...and it can't feel good that people,
you know, hate you.

289
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,697
-lt's good to meet you, Ray.
-No, I'm sorry.

290
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,073
But hear me out.

291
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:08,910
People-- Don't get me wrong, they
should love you. They really should.

292
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:11,913
l wanna deliver that for you.
lt's the least that l can do.

293
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,498
You know, you're a superhero.

294
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,709
Kids should ask you
for your autograph.

295
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,711
People should cheer you
on the streets.

296
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,754
What the hell are you pricks
looking at?

297
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:21,756
No, no, they're not-- lt's all right.

298
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:23,883
They're not pricks, they're just people.

299
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:27,554
But l want you to give me
one short pitch, you know?

300
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:30,390
That's all l ask. Okay?

301
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:32,392
You use....

302
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,602
Put it under here?

303
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:37,147
Put it right there. Perfect.

304
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:40,191
E-mail me or whatever.
You just fly on over, l don't know.

305
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,776
l want you to think about it.

306
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:44,487
Just be careful when you go.
Sleep on it, all right?

307
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:46,781
You get back to me?

308
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:48,867
l'll be right here. All right.

309
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:53,496
Please don't stare, you guys.
He's kind of one of us.

310
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:00,545
What about AllHeart?

311
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:04,007
lt's a nonstarter, babe, you know?
l'm chasing windmills with that.

312
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:07,343
Maybe I can't change the world
but l can change this guy's life.

313
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:11,181
-Think about all the good he can do.
-l think you're wasting your time.

314
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:13,099
You really hate him.

315
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:16,436
Hate? I don't hate him, Ray.
l don't even know the guy.

316
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:20,607
Just look at the news.
You can see what he does.

317
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:24,360
l think he just needs
people to care, you know?

318
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,072
You see the good in everybody, Ray.

319
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,242
Even sometimes when it's not there.

320
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:36,498
l have a feeling about this.
Don't work with this guy.

321
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:42,086
l know this kind of guy.
He breaks things.

322
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,167
My bad. Everybody all right?

323
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:46,961
l'll go and get my mommy.

324
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:49,505
He is an asshole.

325
00:25:56,931 --> 00:25:59,015
-What's your name, boy?
-Michel.

326
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:05,647
-You know who l am?
-My papa says you are an asshole.

327
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,608
Well, that's not really a nice word
to call a person, is it?

328
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:10,652
-Asshole?
-Yeah.

329
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,863
Because that could make someone
very angry...

330
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:16,240
...and, you know, maybe
hurt their feelings.

331
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,951
You behave like an asshole.

332
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:23,247
All right....

333
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,958
Do you know Aaron?

334
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:33,591
Well, seems to be a pretty good kid.

335
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:36,135
Just wanna ask you
to lay off of him a little bit.

336
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:38,012
Why, asshole?

337
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,851
-You're gonna stop calling me that.
-Asshole.

338
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,064
-That's not my name.
-Asshole.

339
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:54,529
Call me a asshole...

340
00:26:54,697 --> 00:26:56,072
...one more time.

341
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:01,828
Asshole.

342
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,958
How about you, thickness?

343
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:08,626
Goggles?

344
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:12,714
Hancock! You son of a gun,
l knew you'd come.

345
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,298
Ask Mary. l had a feeling.

346
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,718
l said, he heard me
and he's ready for a change.

347
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,637
This is great. Did you do this?
You come in a little hot?

348
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,305
l'll meet you in the house.

349
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:24,517
-l know you don't drive, but--
-Oh, damn it, Ray.

350
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:30,189
All right. You're all right.
You're all right. You're all right.

351
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:35,361
Oh, stop crying, punk-ass. Go ahead.

352
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,323
-Not okay. Okay?
-He all right.

353
00:27:39,742 --> 00:27:42,744
Really not okay. This is some
of the stuff we're gonna work on.

354
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,997
How do you think that conversation's
gonna go down with his mom?

355
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:48,916
Landing like that in the street's
also on the uncool side.

356
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:52,378
No, that was already like that
when l got here, Ray.

357
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:54,714
l live here.
l know what the street's like.

358
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,758
We'll make those problems
of the past.

359
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,469
l'm gonna teach you
how to interface with the public.

360
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:02,805
-Where's the wife?
-Mary took Aaron to his soccer game.

361
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:04,932
Hancock, pulled some stuff up
on YouTube.

362
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,395
Surprisingly large amount of not-great
stuff on you that's gonna be helpful.

363
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:10,855
What is this?

364
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:13,775
That's me trying to change the world.

365
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,860
Unfortunately, not doing real well.

366
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,987
Come on. Let's get to you.

367
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,615
This stuff was on YouTube.

368
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:24,118
Everybody loves a Nutty Buddy,
l get it, but this doesn't work, sir.

369
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:28,080
<i>Hey, give me a Nutty Buddy.</i>
<i>Back up, back up.</i>

370
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:32,627
<i>Mom! Mom! Mom!</i>

371
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,587
Those are children.

372
00:28:36,507 --> 00:28:39,675
<i>-We've been waiting a long time--</i>
<i>-Get that camera out of my face.</i>

373
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:43,221
You ever put out
an apartment fire, Ray?

374
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,974
-No, I haven't done that. I'm in P.R.
-No. My ass was hot.

375
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:51,395
All right. How about this?
This is Walter, the grey whale.

376
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:54,357
Everybody remembers him
stuck on the beach north of Zuma.

377
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:55,566
Along comes Hancock.

378
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,946
<i>Hancock!</i>

379
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:12,041
-l don't even remember that.
-Yeah.

380
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:15,336
Greenpeace does. Walter does.

381
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,839
This gets redundant after a while...

382
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:21,133
...but my basic diagnosis
of your fundamental problem is--

383
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,969
-Do you wanna hear it?
-No.

384
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:24,470
You're an asshole.

385
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:26,931
l know. l call it like l see it though.

386
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:30,101
lt's not a crime to be an asshole
but it's counterproductive.

387
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,270
But you are an asshole,
don't you think?

388
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,105
Be careful.

389
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:37,525
All right, how about this?
l've been thinking about something.

390
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:40,319
This kind of goes to
how you present yourself.

391
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:43,781
Come on. Really? lt's the middle
of the day. What springs to mind...

392
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:46,409
...when you see this?

393
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:49,328
Homo.

394
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,165
-What about that?
-Homo in red.

395
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,629
-Norwegian homo.
-l'll give you that.

396
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:02,133
Let's move past the comics. Let's
get into something a little deeper.

397
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:07,513
l think that deep down you behave
badly because you're lonely.

398
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:10,600
l think deep down,
you want people's acceptance.

399
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:14,312
Come on, now.
You save people's lives...

400
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:17,565
...and they reject you,
and so you reject them back.

401
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:20,568
And it's a--
And we're gonna switch that cycle.

402
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:22,528
We're gonna start fresh, start anew.

403
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:26,616
This is outstanding. lf you turn
some of this power into willpower....

404
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:29,035
-Almost.
-And then he kicked it in.

405
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,162
Hey, Hancock! We almost won.

406
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:34,624
Yeah, we did. Okay, upstairs.
l'm making lunch. Go change.

407
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,208
Hey, sweetheart.

408
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:39,170
Have you been watching the news?

409
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:42,131
-No, we've been working on--
-lnterfacing with the public.

410
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:44,467
-This has been on all day.
-That's very good.

411
00:30:44,635 --> 00:30:48,054
<i>The law is the law, Mr. Hancock,</i>
<i>and you are not above it.</i>

412
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,515
<i>Felony destruction of property...</i>

413
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:55,478
<i>...amounting to tens of millions</i>
<i>of dollars, theft, and now this.</i>

414
00:30:55,646 --> 00:31:00,107
<i>From where l sit,</i>
<i>l see a selfish, self-absorbed man...</i>

415
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:04,612
<i>...with a lot of muscle, but no regard</i>
<i>for anyone but yourself.</i>

416
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,114
<i>Mr. Hancock, let me remind you.</i>

417
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:10,076
<i>You are not above the law.</i>

418
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:15,164
<i>You have failed to show</i>
<i>at over 600 subpoenas in civil suits.</i>

419
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:19,001
<i>Anybody else would be held</i>
<i>in contempt. But, oh, no. Not you.</i>

420
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:22,296
<i>You may be a superhero,</i>
<i>but let me tell you this:</i>

421
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:26,342
<i>You're not nearly as strong</i>
<i>as the U.S. Constitution.</i>

422
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,010
<i>Bank on it, buddy.</i>

423
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:29,887
<i>We do not condone the t--</i>

424
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,099
Genius.

425
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:35,851
Things just got real.
This is exactly what we need.

426
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:39,021
There's a DA trying to figure out
how to put you in jail.

427
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:41,816
-Bitch can try.
-l say you go.

428
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:47,947
People take you for granted.
Make people miss you.

429
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:51,283
-People don't like you, Hancock.
-l do.

430
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:54,495
Two weeks, you know?
The public will be clamouring for you.

431
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:56,372
When they do, we'll be ready.

432
00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:00,209
Worst-case scenario is l'm wrong and
you just, you know, fly out of there.

433
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:02,628
What do you got to lose?

434
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:24,108
"l apologise to the people
of Los Angeles.

435
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:27,820
My behaviour has been improper
and l accept the consequences.

436
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,656
<i>l ask my fellow Angelenos...</i>

<i>...for their patience</i>

438
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,494
You're an asshole, Hancock!

439
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:36,704
Asshole!

440
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:42,001
"Life here can be difficult for me.

441
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:44,295
After all, I'm the only one of my kind.

444
00:32:57,893 --> 00:32:59,060
You're a drunk bum!

445
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:02,354
"You deserve better from me.
l can be better. l will be better."

446
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,398
All right.

447

<i>Good morning, ladies.</i>
<i>Welcome to your new home....</i>

<i>...to remember</i>

Turn to your right.

Turn to your left.

452
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:27,922
Okay, scumbags. Let's go.

453
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:36,180
Give me the hand, playboy.

454
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:57,368
l see you, punk!

455
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:18,806
Oh, l get it.

456
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:22,393
l put some-- Most of you in here.

457
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,562
Yes, you did.

458
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:31,402
l can understand you feeling
some kind of way about that.

459
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,070
What?

460
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:38,409
So l'm gonna do me,
and l'm gonna let you do you.

461
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,744
l don't want no trouble.

462
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:43,247
All right?

463
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:45,416
l just wanna go to my cell.

464
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:48,419
-That ain't gonna happen.
-Nope.

465
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,880
Excuse me.

466
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:55,676
Excuse me, please.

467
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,098
Deadly.

468
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:05,519
lf you don't move,
your head is going up his ass.

469
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:15,571
Y'all fellas sure you wanna
ride this train?

470
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:18,490
Choo, choo, asshole.

471
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:37,051
Get him out! Get him out!

472
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:46,602
Did you shove a man's head
up another man's ass?

473
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,861
We're gonna--
We're gonna circle back to that.

474
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,406
The DA's office wants your sentence
to run eight years.

475
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:02,701
lt's a big number,
but not something we didn't anticipate.

476
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,954
You know, our plan is--
What are you doing?

477
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:08,207
Hey, hey, hey!

478
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:17,758
lt sounded like you said they want me
to spend eight years in this shithole.

479
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:20,594
Eight is more like four and a half
with good behaviour.

480
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:24,890
But it's irrelevant because
with you out of the picture...

481
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:27,685
...and with the crime rate
going up through the roof...

482
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:31,814
...the DA and the cops, they're all
gonna call for your immediate release.

483
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:34,608
They're gonna demand it.
Where are you going? Sit down.

484
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:37,403
Hey. Hey. Stop right there.

485
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,779
-Stop it. Hancock.
-Move.

486
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:40,489
-Hancock!
-Get back!

487
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:42,199
You're being a coward!

488
00:36:42,993 --> 00:36:44,952
-Who you talking to?
-l'm talking to you.

489
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,998
-Who are you talking to, Ray?
-Stop pretending that you do not care.

490
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:51,625
You have a calling.
You're a hero, Hancock.

491
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:55,629
You're gonna be miserable the rest
of your life until you accept that.

492
00:36:55,797 --> 00:37:00,134
Trust me. Trust this plan,
this process. Just stay in here.

493
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:04,096
When they call, a hero's
what we're gonna give them.

494
00:37:06,308 --> 00:37:07,975
How we gonna do that, Ray?

495
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,146
All right, guys, let's start sharing.

496
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:14,231
-Don? You had something?
-Yeah.

497
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:19,528
Yeah, l think l might've had
a little bit of a breakthrough.

498
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:21,363
Good for you.

499
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:26,327
Yeah, l mean, l realised
that breaking necks is-- lt's easy.

500
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:31,915
But l'm sitting there and l'm
staring at myself in the mirror...

501
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:35,919
-...and l thought, "This is tough."
-Yeah, it sounds tough.

502
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,297
Why do you always laugh?

503
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:41,884
Picturing you looking at the mirror.
lt would scare the shit out of me.

504
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:45,888
Every time l'm talking,
he completely ruins the cycle.

505
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:47,556
Now, let's watch the crosstalk.

506
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:50,184
l'm not gonna share anymore
if he keeps doing that.

507
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:51,602
No, no, no.

508
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,854
-Keep sharing.
-Let's move on.

509
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:55,898
Mr. Hancock,
do you wanna share today?

510
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,068
Pass.

511
00:37:59,361 --> 00:38:02,863
Your landing is your first impression.
lt's your superhero handshake.

512
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:06,367
Don't come in too hot, okay?
Don't come in too boozy.

513
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,952
And don't land on
a $1 00,000 Mercedes. All right?

514
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,872
People have to be happy
that you've arrived.

515
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:13,999
Mr. Hancock, your share.

516
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:16,168
Pass.

517
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:19,088
So you've used the door
and the building's still intact.

518
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:21,757
People are happy that you've arrived.
They feel safe.

519
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:24,176
There's an officer
and he's done a good job...

520
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:26,095
...so tell him he's done a good job.

521
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:29,181
What the hell did l have to come for
if he's done a good job?

522
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:41,235
Oh, man!

526
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:54,998

l respect your courage...

530
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:04,508
...because bullets don't bounce
off you, they bounce off me."

Mr. Hancock,
would you like to share?

539

-Pass.
-Good.

00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:37,916
Good.

Good j--

542
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:49,094
Good job.

543
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:53,474
<i>Jail watch, day five, and true to his</i>
<i>word, Hancock remains incarcerated.</i>

544
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,684
<i>Meanwhile, crime is still on the rise.</i>

545
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:59,354

547
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:11,200
-Hancock! Hey, Hancock!
-Hey, little buddy.

548
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:14,244
-Hancock. We brought you something!
-Hey, hey.

549
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:17,331
Hey, what's up, Hancock?

550
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,124
Where's--? Where's Ray?

551
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,793
No, it's just us. Ray's working.

552
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,962
Aaron really wanted
to come and see you...

553
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:27,341
...so we just dropped by
with some Spaghetti Madness.

554
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:29,927
l should probably let the guard
check for keys--

555
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:34,056
-No, no. Here.
-Okay. Here you go.

556
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:37,434
Oh, you brought me meatballs, huh?

557
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:42,314
-Just dig in.
-Oh, man, look at that. Look at that.

558
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:49,905
-That's a good meatball.
-Thanks, Hancock.

559
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:56,370
Ray is a good man.

560
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:07,923
Whatever this is you're doing,
don't let him down.

561
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,926
Okay?

562
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:15,639
Okay. Well, we should
probably go, buddy.

563
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:18,767
-Already? l wanna stay with Hancock.
-Yeah. Sweetheart...

564
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:21,770
...we have to go.
Come on, say goodbye to Hancock.

565
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:25,148
Here, Hancock. lt's my favourite one,
and l want you to have it.

566
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,526
-That was very sweet.
-Thanks, Mom.

567
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:29,278
Come here.

568
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:49,965
Mr. Hancock,
would you like to share?

569
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:51,758
Pass.

570
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:54,177
All right. Phillip?

571
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:58,098
l love you guys, man.

572
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:01,018
-We love you.
-We love you too, Phillip.

573
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,360
For when they call.

574
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:59,660
-l ain't wearing that, Ray.
-Yes, you are.

575
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,536
-Oh, no, l'm not.
-No, you are.

576
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:02,913
Actually, l'm not, Ray.

577
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:04,873
You think you're not, but you are.

578
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:09,920
l will fight crime butt-ass naked
before l fight it in that, Ray.

579
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:13,840
You know, you have fought naked.
We've got that. That's on YouTube.

580
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:17,636
Hancock, this is a uniform.
A uniform represents purpose.

581
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:20,472
Doctors, policemen, firemen, right?

582
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,183
-lt represents a calling.
-lt's been two weeks.

583
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:26,770
-Yeah?
-Nobody out there is missing me, Ray.

584
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:30,315
Just be patient.
You gotta trust me on this. All right?

585
00:43:57,218 --> 00:43:59,761
Perimeter breach, perimeter breach.

586
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:02,681
Asshole!

587
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,979
You're still a fake-ass punk.

588
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:25,328
Damn!

589
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:26,580
<i>Mr. Hancock?</i>

Pass.

592
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:38,842
-Come on, man, try it. Let it out.
-Come on, John.

593
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,302
l don't have nothing.

594
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:43,013
There's nothing on your mind?
Come on, John.

595
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:44,473
-lt's cool, man.
-Come on.

596
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,891
-Come on.
-Do it.

597
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,392
First time for everything.

598
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:50,771
-Feels good to release, now.
-Let it heal. Come on, man, try it.

599
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:54,399
Come in here all these days,
you don't have anything to share?

600
00:44:56,027 --> 00:45:00,947
l'm Hancock, and I drink and stuff.

601
00:45:03,993 --> 00:45:05,452
All right. Thanks for sharing.

602
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:08,455
-Okay.
-Thank you.

603
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,248

-That's awesome.

604
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:13,460
-That's a clap. Yeah.
-There you go. Good share.

605
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:31,269
Hey, Hancock.

606
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:33,355
Come on, get up.

607
00:45:33,523 --> 00:45:36,566
-You got a phone call.
-Take a message.

608
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,944
lt's the chief of police.

609
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:41,530
He says he needs your help.

610
00:46:06,848 --> 00:46:10,350
The trapped officer's husband
is Corporal Joseph Blake...

611
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:12,352
...who was killed last year in lraq...

612
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,981
<i>...leaving her two small children.</i>
<i>We are waiting for the latest news...</i>

<i>...but apparently</i>
<i>there are three suspects and....</i>

614
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:20,151
What's going on?

615
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:23,154
l'm out!

616
00:46:23,823 --> 00:46:26,449
Stay down! Stay down!

617
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,326
Stay down!

618
00:46:28,995 --> 00:46:30,078
-Get out!
-Get down!

619
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:31,413
Get it down!

620
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,546
Let's go! Everybody's gotta get back!
Let's go!

621
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:42,007
Back! Move!

622
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:58,398
We got perimeters set up
on the north, east and south sides.

623
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:00,400
The west side is open.

624
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:11,620
Don't break the building,
don't break the building.

625
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:21,463
What?

626
00:47:25,927 --> 00:47:27,594
lt's a little tight. What you got?

627
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:31,765
Bank job. l got at least eight hostages.
Four bad guys.

628
00:47:31,933 --> 00:47:34,100
Officer pinned down.
We can't get to her.

629
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:38,229
They been spraying
the hell out of us all morning. And--

630
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:41,816
They got some kind of heavy artillery.
Fifty calibre or bigger.

631
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:45,654
-l don't know if that matters to you.
-No, I'm good.

632
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:56,915
Good job.

633
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:59,209
Really, good job.

634
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:08,176
Get down!

635
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:39,666
lt's Hancock!

636
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:48,299
Take him out!

637
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:53,805
Good job!

638
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:57,017
Do l have permission
to touch your body?

639
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:58,727
Yes!

640
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:02,272
lt's not sexual.

641
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,984
Not that you're not
an attractive woman.

642
00:49:06,152 --> 00:49:08,987
-You're a very attractive woman--
-Get me the fuck out of here!

643
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:16,119
He's on the move!

644
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:32,427
He's moving, he's moving!

645
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,271
Good job.

646
00:49:43,439 --> 00:49:44,898
-Are you hit anywhere?
-My leg!

647
00:49:45,066 --> 00:49:46,608
-Hancock!
-Good job.

648
00:49:46,776 --> 00:49:49,152
You said that.
l need you to end this now.

649
00:49:57,745 --> 00:49:59,370
Check the flanks.

650
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:02,832
Secure the perimeter.

651
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:08,296
Spread out!

652
00:50:08,464 --> 00:50:10,507
They're gonna
come around the back.

653
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:24,687
What happened to him?

654
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:29,567
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?

655
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:38,243
What is happening?

656
00:50:52,925 --> 00:50:55,760
-l heard you was in the slammer.
-Out early.

657
00:50:55,928 --> 00:50:58,596
-Why's that?
-Good behaviour.

658
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:01,099
Do you know what this is?

659
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:08,690
l'm guessing it's
some kind of detonator-type deal.

660
00:51:08,858 --> 00:51:12,235
There's 8 pounds of C-4 strapped
to each and every one of them.

661
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:14,487
This is a spring-loaded
dead man's switch.

662
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:16,281
lf my thumb comes off it:

663
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:22,787
And now, since we've had
a little change of plan...

664
00:51:22,955 --> 00:51:27,125
...between the police showing up and
you sucking out all of my associates...

665
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:29,460
...l want you to break into the vault.

666
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:32,881
You'll find three quarter-ton pallets
of small bills inside.

667
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:34,632
Thirty million dollars.

668
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:37,552
And you're gonna carry it for me.

669
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:41,723
You are gonna get me safely
away from here with the money...

670
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:46,227
...or else they'll be cleaning up
these hostages with a mop.

671
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:51,232
l'm gonna have to say no to that.

672
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,321
l'm really trying
to turn over a new leaf.

673
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:59,198
l will blow up this entire building,
you asshole.

674
00:52:02,328 --> 00:52:04,662
l really don't like that word.

675
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,789
l will blow them sky-high...

676
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:09,667
...and their blood
will be on your hands.

677
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,340
Do you hear me, asshole?

678
00:52:24,016 --> 00:52:26,517
Call me a asshole...

679
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:28,394
...one more time.

680
00:52:31,357 --> 00:52:33,232
Ass--

681
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:40,448
-Go, go, go. Move in!
-Go on, you're safe!

682
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:43,034
-Let's go. Let's go.
-Take it right in. Let's go.

683
00:52:43,202 --> 00:52:45,244
Bring it around now.

684
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:08,393
Keep your hand on that trigger.

685
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:12,605
-Good job.
-No. You, good job.

686
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,943
-Thank you.
-Good job.

687
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:21,030
Hancock!

688
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:18,337
Say hi to your fans.
Look what you got.

689
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:20,631
Here we go. This way.

690
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:24,385
-Hancock. At the bank today, intense.
-Thank you.

691
00:54:24,553 --> 00:54:26,345
Smile.

692
00:54:26,555 --> 00:54:27,638
Good job, Hancock!

693
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:32,226
Hey. Boy, they'll let anybody in here,
huh?

694
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:36,355
Hancock, meet these guys. This is
Mike Kilbourne and Jeremy Himmel.

695
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:38,024
Gigantic fans. lnsane!

696
00:54:38,192 --> 00:54:40,443
These guys are partners
at the biggest ad firm.

697
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:41,944
You never call, man.

698
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:46,157
-l have called. A couple of times.
-Water under the bridge, man.

699
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:52,163
Could you guys
get used to this or what?

700
00:54:54,083 --> 00:54:55,792
How'd you two meet?

701
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:59,253
l was married once before.

702
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:01,506
First wife...

703
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:05,468
...she died giving birth to Aaron.

704
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:10,348
lt's another dinner. But.... But....

705
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:13,101
So there l am, l'm with
this beautiful little baby.

706
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:15,061
l don't know what the hell to do.

707
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:17,480
And l was in the supermarket...

708
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,108
...and l'm in the baby aisle...

709
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:22,860
...and l've got
a brand of diapers in each hand.

710
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:26,989
l'm staring at them, but l don't know
how l'm gonna get through the day.

711
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:29,450
An angel...

712
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:32,995
...sees me.

713
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:37,625
She knew. She was--
She gave me this look.

714
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:44,215
And even in the trance l was in,
l knew that somebody somewhere...

715
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:46,425
...was throwing me a little rope.

716
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,261
You know?

717
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:52,431
Starting that day, you really
put my life back together. Right?

718
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,562
-You're drunk.
-So? Come here.

719
00:56:02,818 --> 00:56:04,402
What about you, buddy?

720
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:06,529
You're from another planet,
aren't you?

721
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:08,865
No, man, I'm from Miami.

722
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:11,409
You didn't come in on,
like, a meteor or--?

723
00:56:11,577 --> 00:56:14,162
Nope. Woke up in a hospital,
first thing l remember.

724
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:18,332
Government hospital, yes?
Experimenting on you and--

725
00:56:18,667 --> 00:56:22,295
No, Ray. Regular old
Miami emergency room.

726
00:56:23,005 --> 00:56:25,882
-Come on.
-My skull was fractured.

727
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:29,677
They told me
l tried to stop a mugging.

728
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:34,098
-Somebody knocked you out.
-l guess I was a regular guy before...

729
00:56:34,266 --> 00:56:37,518
...and when l woke up,
l was changed.

730
00:56:38,687 --> 00:56:41,272
The hospital nurse tried
to put a needle in my arm...

731
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,733
...and it just broke against my skin.

732
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:47,612
And then my skull healed
in, like, an hour.

733
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:51,365
The doctors were astounded...

734
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:55,328
...and they wanted to know my story.

735
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:59,248
Just like you. But l couldn't tell them.
l don't know who l am.

736
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:02,084
Amnesia.

737
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:06,172
-You know, the blow to the head.
-Yeah, well, that's what they figured.

738
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:10,051
-You don't remember anything?
-No.

739
00:57:11,178 --> 00:57:14,013
Only thing l had in my pocket was...

740
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:16,140
...bubble-gum...

741
00:57:16,308 --> 00:57:18,434
...two movie tickets.

742
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:22,230
Boris Karloff, Frankenstein.

743
00:57:22,731 --> 00:57:25,650
But no lD, nothing.

744
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:30,529
l went to sign out, the nurse
asked me for my John Hancock.

745
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:34,158
l actually thought that's who l was.

746
00:57:35,327 --> 00:57:37,036
How come l didn't hear any of this...

747
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:39,163
...didn't read about it
in any newspapers?

748
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:42,708
lt was probably in the papers
80 years ago.

749
00:57:43,252 --> 00:57:44,752
Eighty years ago?

750
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:47,213
Oh, l don't age. This is it.

751
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:50,216
-That's nice.
-Gotta wonder, though:

752
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:55,888
What kind of bastard
must l have been...

753
00:57:59,518 --> 00:58:01,727
...that nobody was there to claim me?

754
00:58:06,275 --> 00:58:10,403
l mean, l'm not the most
charming guy in the world...

755
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,989
...so l've been told, but...

756
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,076
...nobody?

757
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:34,218
Whoever it was they'd be dead
by now, anyway.

758
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:37,555
Hey.

759
00:58:37,723 --> 00:58:40,516
Hey, Mary. You all right, baby?

760
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:44,437
Yeah. Too much wine.

761
00:58:44,688 --> 00:58:47,064
l am a lightweight.

762
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:55,114
l'm sorry.

763
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:00,619
You ain't do nothing.

764
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:06,917
This was a nice dinner, Ray.

765
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:13,799
-lt was a good one.
-Almost call this fun.

766
00:59:18,597 --> 00:59:20,848
That didn't tire you out,
coming up the stairs?

767
00:59:21,016 --> 00:59:23,142
-Not really.
-l'm real spinny.

768
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:26,228
Could've just flown me upstairs.

769
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:29,065
-l could've done without that.
-Get your shoes off here.

770
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:32,610
All right, that's all you're
getting off of me though.

771
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:38,574
You believe in me,
don't you, Hancock?

772
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:41,869
-Of course, Ray. l believe in you.
-Help me up here.

773
00:59:42,037 --> 00:59:44,080
l got something to say to you.

774
00:59:45,165 --> 00:59:47,708
Listen to me. This is important.

775
00:59:49,503 --> 00:59:53,005
You are like a Dodger Dog.

776
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:55,883
lt's something people don't think
they're gonna like...

777
00:59:56,051 --> 00:59:58,552
...then they try it and they love it,
right? lt hits the spot.

778
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,597
lt's good for the soul.
You're like the world's Dodger Dog.

779
01:00:01,765 --> 01:00:03,933
l don't know.
But you know what l mean, right?

780
01:00:06,895 --> 01:00:08,437
You're gonna do great.

781
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:12,775
You're gonna fix everything.

782
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:20,783
-You get some sleep, Ray.
-You sleep tight too.

783
01:00:21,535 --> 01:00:24,036
Hancock tucking me in.

784
01:00:35,841 --> 01:00:38,175
All right, he's asleep.

785
01:00:42,222 --> 01:00:45,433
-Okay, thanks. Good night.
-Good night.

786
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:56,444
Look, l just don't want you
to think that-- That Ray...

787
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:58,487
...you know, drinks like that,
because--

788
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:00,906
-Oh, no.
-This was just kind of...

789
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:03,033
-...a celebratory night.
-No, I understand.

790
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:06,203
-Yeah, l know that.
-Okay.

791
01:01:09,124 --> 01:01:12,585
The damn babysitter
never cleans up after herself.

792
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:33,522
You have a bruise on your hand.

793
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,775
Yeah, l don't--
l don't know what that is.

794
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:40,988
l've been feeling kind of funny.

795
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:46,827
You--

796
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:49,121
You should go.

797
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:56,712
Getting late.

798
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:49,473
lf Ray finds out about me...

799
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:53,686
...you're dead.

800
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:44,403
Joan, we're gonna take care
of that, okay? Don't you worry.

801
01:03:46,406 --> 01:03:48,240
Hi, honey.

802
01:03:48,408 --> 01:03:50,409
Breakfast?

803
01:03:50,785 --> 01:03:53,412
Hancock sneezed, huh?

804
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:56,749
Can you believe it? lt's amazing
that you slept through that.

805
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:59,752
-You're a good sleeper.
-Holy shit.

806
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:03,380
l'm not gonna say
l told you so, but....

807
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:06,634
You told me he was gonna sneeze
a hole through the house?

808
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:08,260
l just said him being around--

809
01:04:08,428 --> 01:04:10,638
Oh, sweetheart, can you get that?
Thanks.

810
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:13,265
-Oh, God, you strong man.
-l got it.

811
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:15,726
But you don't worry about anything.

812
01:04:15,894 --> 01:04:19,229
l already apologised to the neighbours.
Called State Farm.

813
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:20,856
Everything is taken care of.

814
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:23,275
You just...

815
01:04:24,486 --> 01:04:27,363
...enjoy that breakfast.

816
01:04:29,157 --> 01:04:31,950
What's this?
Are we going on vacation? Are we?

817
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:33,327
Just the three of us.

818
01:04:33,495 --> 01:04:34,953
-End of the summer?
-Tonight.

819
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:37,289
-Tonight?
-Spur of the moment.

820
01:04:37,457 --> 01:04:40,959
-Tonight might be a little tough.
-Come on. The three of us?

821
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:43,003
Me in a bikini?

822
01:04:43,171 --> 01:04:44,713
-Sounds good.
-Let's go somewhere.

823
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:45,798
Knock, knock.

824
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:50,094
Gesundheit.

825
01:04:50,804 --> 01:04:55,307
l was just telling Ray here,
l hope you're done sneezing...

826
01:04:55,475 --> 01:05:00,771
...because l don't think our house could
take much more of your sneezing.

827
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:11,031
Yeah, sometimes
l sneeze when there's dust...

828
01:05:13,535 --> 01:05:15,661
...or if l get really surprised.

829
01:05:16,955 --> 01:05:19,998
That's unfortunate.
This is Kilbourne.

830
01:05:20,834 --> 01:05:23,252
Mike? How you doing?

831
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,380
lt was great to see you too.

832
01:05:26,548 --> 01:05:29,758
Yep. Well....

833
01:05:29,968 --> 01:05:32,344
Right. Go ahead, shoot.

834
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:36,557
Okay. l got a pen right here.

835
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:39,560
Right. No, l know.

836
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:46,775
lt's right here in my hand.

837
01:05:54,284 --> 01:05:56,368
l am warning you.

838
01:05:56,536 --> 01:05:57,786
All right, go ahead.

839
01:06:01,332 --> 01:06:02,458
Okay, good.

840
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:08,005
Now.... And that's still in 31 0, right?

841
01:06:08,173 --> 01:06:09,339
Hang on one second.

842
01:06:10,175 --> 01:06:11,467
Do me a favour...?

843
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:15,637
l'm sorry, Mike. Yeah.

844
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:17,681
We're gonna talk.

845
01:06:17,849 --> 01:06:20,767
Go away.

846
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:24,855
Well, it is something
that l'm really excited about.

847
01:06:36,284 --> 01:06:39,328
-l'm gonna do this all day.
-Shut-- Shut up.

848
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:43,207
l-- l suppose....

849
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:45,709
-Fine. We'll talk, okay?
-We will.

850
01:06:45,919 --> 01:06:50,756
And when we're done talking, you
go away and you leave my family alone.

851
01:06:51,883 --> 01:06:54,968
-My place at 4:00.
-Whatever.

852
01:06:55,929 --> 01:06:59,348
lt means.... Well, l'd rather not
talk numbers now.

853
01:06:59,516 --> 01:07:02,601
l'd like to save them for the pitch.
So let's just set a time.

854
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:05,812
That's good with me.
l will see you then. All right.

855
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:08,899
Yeah, 3:30. Great.

856
01:07:09,192 --> 01:07:11,652
Hon, is it hot in here?

857
01:07:32,924 --> 01:07:36,093
He hurt you, didn't he?

858
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:39,596
Come on, use your words.

859
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:42,307
How did it make you feel?

860
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:46,353
Sore.

861
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:50,274
Bad.

862
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:54,653
lt's because he took your power.
And you have to get your power back.

863
01:07:56,155 --> 01:08:00,576
And no one will give you your power
back. You have to go out and take it.

864
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:02,869
You understand me?

865
01:08:04,539 --> 01:08:06,498
We're gonna go find Hancock...

866
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:10,460
...and get your power back.

867
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:43,160
Well, l'm here.

868
01:08:44,162 --> 01:08:45,704
Yup.

869
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:54,713
-You wanna do it?
-Do what?

870
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:00,552
l don't have time for this, okay?
You ask the questions...

871
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,679
...l answer them honestly
and then you leave L.A.

872
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,431
l ain't leaving L.A.

873
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:10,020
All right, all right. Jeez.

874
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:13,649
Don't.

875
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:27,579
Ask.

876
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:31,249
-You and l.
-"You and l" what?

877
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:34,169
-We're the same.
-No.

878
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:36,505
l'm stronger.

879
01:09:37,298 --> 01:09:38,715
Really?

880
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:43,261
Oh, yeah.

881
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:46,098
Who are we?

882
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:51,061
Gods, angels. Different cultures
call us by different names.

883
01:09:51,229 --> 01:09:54,272
Now all of a sudden, it's "superhero."

884
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:58,068
-Are there more of us?
-There were.

885
01:09:58,403 --> 01:09:59,569
They all died.

886
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:03,740
lt's just the two of us.

887
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:13,875
What is this?

888
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,464
Who are we to each other?

889
01:10:20,633 --> 01:10:22,634
-We're brother and sister.
-That's a lie.

890
01:10:24,137 --> 01:10:25,887
-No, I'm your sister.
-That is a lie.

891
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:27,764
-l'm your sister.
-That is a lie.

892
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:31,059
Sisters don't kiss brothers
the way you kissed me last night.

893
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:32,561
You're lying, deal's off.

894
01:10:32,729 --> 01:10:34,813
Let's go see
how Ray feels about this.

895
01:10:34,981 --> 01:10:37,149
Get your ass back here!

896
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:39,234
l'm telling!

897
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:46,992
The AllHeart symbol
will be known globally...

898
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:49,161
...as a symbol...

899
01:10:49,328 --> 01:10:54,207
...that represents companies that
are committed to changing the world.

900
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:56,835
They can give away
their sustenance goods, okay?

901
01:10:57,003 --> 01:10:59,296
Food, drugs, power, clothing,
for free.

902
01:10:59,464 --> 01:11:01,882
-We were talking about Hancock--
-Number two.

903
01:11:13,186 --> 01:11:14,978
You stay away
from me and my family.

904
01:11:15,146 --> 01:11:17,564
You are not gonna
do this to me again.

905
01:11:17,732 --> 01:11:20,776
What? l don't know
what you're talking about.

906
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:22,903
-Hey!
-l love you, Hancock!

907
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:26,573
lt can't work.
lt always ends the same way.

908
01:11:26,741 --> 01:11:29,242
Persia. Greece. Brooklyn.

909
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:31,203
Brooklyn?
l've never been to Brooklyn.

910
01:11:31,496 --> 01:11:34,080
l have put up with your bullshit
for 3000 years...

911
01:11:34,248 --> 01:11:36,166
...and l am done!
Done, you listening?

912
01:11:36,334 --> 01:11:39,628
-l don't know what you're talking about!
-Finally, l am happy!

913
01:11:39,796 --> 01:11:43,423
-You are not gonna mess with that!
-l don't know what you're talking about!

914
01:11:43,591 --> 01:11:46,092
l hate to burst
your little crazy-lady bubble...

915
01:11:46,385 --> 01:11:50,931
...but it must not have been all that
great because I don't remember you.

916
01:11:55,937 --> 01:11:58,313
Call me crazy...

917
01:11:59,774 --> 01:12:01,691
...one more time.

918
01:12:01,943 --> 01:12:03,276
Cuckoo.

919
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:14,079
All right, hold it. All right.

920
01:12:14,622 --> 01:12:17,415
You better not hit me with that truck.

921
01:12:18,125 --> 01:12:21,920
For companies to qualify, they need to
prove they are a leader in the global--

922
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:23,713
We wanna talk about Mr. Hancock.

923
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:25,841
They're committed
to bettering the world.

924
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:28,468
They can do this in four ways.
This is how they....

925
01:13:11,137 --> 01:13:14,014
The most important thing
with AllHeart is brand recognition.

926
01:13:14,181 --> 01:13:16,141
l've mocked up
these examples here...

927
01:13:16,309 --> 01:13:18,310
...in Tokyo, London, Dubai, Paris.

928
01:13:30,031 --> 01:13:31,781
Oh, no.

929
01:13:32,325 --> 01:13:34,326
We need maximum exposure,
market penetra--

930
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:35,535
ls it snowing?

931
01:13:50,343 --> 01:13:52,010
Stop. Stop it.

932
01:13:52,178 --> 01:13:54,971
Stop. Stop. Stop!
All right, let's just--

933
01:13:55,139 --> 01:14:04,648
Get off me!

934
01:14:05,524 --> 01:14:07,025
Stop. Stop!

935
01:14:07,193 --> 01:14:08,818
Get off!

936
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:10,236
-Get off me!
-Listen to me!

937
01:14:10,404 --> 01:14:12,864
-l hate you!
-l am sorry!

938
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:20,872
Whoever l am, whatever l did--
Look at me.

939
01:14:21,791 --> 01:14:23,792
--l'm sorry.

940
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:26,252
l don't remember.

941
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:29,589
You are the most beautiful thing
l have ever seen.

942
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:41,935
Oh, my God.

943
01:15:32,403 --> 01:15:35,697
Why were you flying?
You were flying, Mary.

944
01:15:36,782 --> 01:15:39,617
-Yeah, she was definitely flying, Ray.
-Okay, l was flying.

945
01:15:40,745 --> 01:15:43,371
And l'm very strong as well.

946
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:45,081
-lt's just the way we are.
-"We"?

947
01:15:45,249 --> 01:15:48,334
Me and him, it's just us now.
The others paired up and died.

948
01:15:48,502 --> 01:15:51,421
You didn't say anything
about pairing up at the trailer.

949
01:15:51,589 --> 01:15:54,215
-You were at his trailer.
-This is hard to explain.

950
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:55,800
-Great, l'm all ears.
-Me too.

951
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:58,762
Do me a favour, just give me
and my wife one moment.

952
01:15:58,929 --> 01:16:01,389
-Don't bring it here, Ray.
-The adults are talking.

953
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:03,224
Technically speaking...

954
01:16:05,102 --> 01:16:06,269
...he's my husband.

955
01:16:07,438 --> 01:16:09,898
Holy shit.

956
01:16:10,316 --> 01:16:13,109
-What?
-We broke up decades ago.

957
01:16:13,277 --> 01:16:16,237
Long before you were born.
He just can't remember.

958
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:19,532
But you can, right? You knew?

959
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:22,202
That's something you bring up
on a first date, Mary.

960
01:16:22,369 --> 01:16:25,663
"l don't like to travel.
l'm allergic to cats. l'm immortal."

961
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:28,249
Those are some things
you give a heads-up on.

962
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:32,337
Whatever we are, we were built in twos,
okay? We're drawn to each other.

963
01:16:32,505 --> 01:16:34,881
No matter how far l run,
he's always there.

964
01:16:35,049 --> 01:16:36,674
He finds me. lt's physics.

965
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:39,552
Are you saying that you two
are fated to be together?

966
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:42,639
l've lived for a very long time, Ray.

967
01:16:43,057 --> 01:16:44,766
And the one thing I learned...

968
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:47,727
...fate doesn't decide everything.

969
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:49,687
People get to choose.

970
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:52,148
And you chose...

971
01:16:52,316 --> 01:16:55,652
...to let me think l was here alone.

972
01:17:05,162 --> 01:17:07,747
l didn't think you'd miss
what you didn't remember.

973
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:11,668
Great. Now what?

974
01:17:16,882 --> 01:17:19,300
l didn't plan for this.

975
01:17:42,157 --> 01:17:43,658
<i>Prison authorities confirmed...</i>

976
01:17:43,826 --> 01:17:47,537
<i>...that the prisoner uprising</i>
<i>was led by Kenneth "Red" Parker, Jr...</i>

977
01:17:47,705 --> 01:17:51,040
<i>...who was also the leader of last</i>
<i>week's Spring Street bank robbery.</i>

978
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:53,543
<i>At least eight prisoners</i>
<i>are not accounted for.</i>

979
01:17:53,711 --> 01:17:56,004
<i>More information</i>
<i>on the prison riot in Norwalk.</i>

980
01:17:56,171 --> 01:17:59,424
<i>Construction workers at the prison</i>
<i>were knocked unconscious.</i>

981
01:17:59,592 --> 01:18:01,634
<i>The prisoners stole</i>
<i>the workers' clothes...</i>

982
01:18:01,802 --> 01:18:04,512
<i>...and it's feared at least</i>
<i>some of them have escaped.</i>

983
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,931
<i>Parker is considered</i>
<i>a criminal mastermind.</i>

984
01:18:07,099 --> 01:18:09,809
<i>He is very effective at</i>
<i>using psychological persuasion...</i>

985
01:18:09,977 --> 01:18:12,478
<i>...to organise criminals</i>
<i>from different backgrounds.</i>

986
01:18:12,646 --> 01:18:15,607
<i>He is a former psychology professor</i>
<i>from Stanford University.</i>

987
01:18:15,774 --> 01:18:18,484
<i>While there, he organised</i>
<i>a notorious criminal network...</i>

988
01:18:18,652 --> 01:18:21,029
<i>...comprised of graduate students</i>
<i>from diverse....</i>

989
01:18:21,196 --> 01:18:23,281
Ninety-one ten.

990
01:18:23,449 --> 01:18:25,783
Ninety-one ten?
You gotta be shitting me.

991
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:27,660
Ninety-one ten.

992
01:18:27,828 --> 01:18:30,246
Highway robbery.

993
01:18:54,104 --> 01:18:56,522
-What?
-l'm taking the money.

994
01:19:03,447 --> 01:19:04,572
l can relate to that.

995
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:09,827
You know? lf you want something...

996
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:13,790
...nobody can stop you
from taking it...

997
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:17,126
...you just take it, right?

998
01:19:18,796 --> 01:19:20,672
l like that.

999
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,049
But can you take it?

1000
01:19:26,136 --> 01:19:29,097
My Zagnut bar versus your gun.

1001
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:37,605
Sorry about your window.

1002
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:26,779
-l need Room 1 020.
-Clear!

1003
01:20:26,947 --> 01:20:28,448
l need Room 1 020.

1004
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:35,872
l need IV line, blood quality,
CBC, electrolytes, a PT, and--

1005
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:37,582
Where's his lV line?

1006
01:20:37,958 --> 01:20:40,084
-That's not gonna work.
-l'm in.

1007
01:20:41,545 --> 01:20:43,004
What's happening?

1008
01:20:45,883 --> 01:20:48,885
<i>This just in.</i>
<i>John Hancock has been rushed...</i>

1009
01:20:49,053 --> 01:20:50,803
<i>...to Los Angeles General Hospital.</i>

1010
01:20:50,971 --> 01:20:54,182
<i>Hancock is in serious condition</i>
<i>with multiple gunshot wounds.</i>

1011
01:20:54,349 --> 01:20:56,517
<i>No story yet as to</i>
<i>how this happened to him...</i>

1012
01:20:56,685 --> 01:21:00,688
<i>...but we will continue to cover this</i>
<i>story live. Reporting live from L.A....</i>

1013
01:21:06,987 --> 01:21:09,906
-Any lead on the assailant?
-Mr. Embrey!

1014
01:21:10,074 --> 01:21:14,077
-Just a couple of questions, sir, please.
-Can you describe how it happened?

1015
01:21:14,244 --> 01:21:17,622
From what l've heard,
he was trying to stop a robbery.

1016
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:21,417
Do you know if special ammunition
was used in the gun that shot him?

1017
01:21:21,585 --> 01:21:22,752
Not that l'm aware of.

1018
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:25,338
Could this have to do
with the mysterious woman?

1019
01:21:25,506 --> 01:21:28,257
-He was seen battling her.
-l do not have that answer.

1020
01:21:28,425 --> 01:21:31,594
Could this woman
be more powerful than Hancock?

1021
01:21:34,473 --> 01:21:37,350
Here are the lab results for 209.

1022
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:06,921
You're becoming mortal.

1023
01:22:08,549 --> 01:22:10,424
lt's us...

1024
01:22:10,884 --> 01:22:13,094
...being close to each other.

1025
01:22:13,846 --> 01:22:17,014
lt's never happened this fast before.

1026
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:20,977
You have to leave.

1027
01:22:22,312 --> 01:22:25,106
The further you get from me,
the better you're gonna feel.

1028
01:22:25,274 --> 01:22:27,900
You'll start getting
your powers back...

1029
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:30,945
...and be flying and breaking things...

1030
01:22:31,113 --> 01:22:33,739
...and saving people
before you know it.

1031
01:22:48,088 --> 01:22:52,508
Well, it's like I said,
we were built in pairs.

1032
01:22:52,676 --> 01:22:57,638
And when we get close to
our opposites, we lose our power.

1033
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:04,395
-Why?
-So we can live human lives.

1034
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:07,440
Love, connect...

1035
01:23:08,609 --> 01:23:12,570
...grow old, die.

1036
01:23:13,614 --> 01:23:16,449
What happened to us?

1037
01:23:20,621 --> 01:23:22,747
Summer of 4 B.C.

1038
01:23:23,665 --> 01:23:26,834
We were becoming mortal, like now.

1039
01:23:27,336 --> 01:23:29,545
They came after me with swords.

1040
01:23:32,966 --> 01:23:35,009
But you saved me.

1041
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:41,015
1 850.

1042
01:23:41,433 --> 01:23:43,392
They set our house on fire.

1043
01:23:44,519 --> 01:23:47,438
You pulled me out of the flames.

1044
01:23:49,524 --> 01:23:51,859
Eighty years ago.

1045
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:54,946
What happened then?

1046
01:23:55,489 --> 01:23:58,157
We were living in Miami...

1047
01:23:58,659 --> 01:24:02,078
...and a new movie
was playing in town.

1048
01:24:02,246 --> 01:24:03,329
<i>Frankenstein.</i>

1049
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:08,751
And after...

1050
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:11,045
...we walked down Flagler Street...

1051
01:24:11,213 --> 01:24:15,174
...and you took my hand,
and you held it so tight.

1052
01:24:21,598 --> 01:24:24,558
And they attacked us in an alley.

1053
01:24:28,188 --> 01:24:32,483
They hit you so hard.
There was so much blood.

1054
01:24:33,527 --> 01:24:36,904
They wouldn't let me ride
in the ambulance with you.

1055
01:24:37,823 --> 01:24:42,618
And by the time I got to the hospital,
you were awake.

1056
01:24:46,707 --> 01:24:48,291
But you didn't know me.

1057
01:24:50,794 --> 01:24:53,004
So l left.

1058
01:24:54,131 --> 01:24:56,966
Every time we're together...

1059
01:24:57,467 --> 01:24:59,927
...they come after you through me.

1060
01:25:13,608 --> 01:25:17,778
You're built to save people
more than the rest of us.

1061
01:25:17,946 --> 01:25:20,865
That's who you are. You're a hero.

1062
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:25,161
The insurance policy of the gods.

1063
01:25:25,704 --> 01:25:28,914
Keep one alive. You.

1064
01:25:29,583 --> 01:25:32,376
To protect this world.

1065
01:25:48,477 --> 01:25:49,518
Mary!

1066
01:25:52,314 --> 01:25:53,356
Mom!

1067
01:25:53,523 --> 01:25:54,899
-Mary!
-Stay down!

1068
01:25:56,026 --> 01:25:57,526
Okay.

1069
01:26:07,954 --> 01:26:09,205
Mary?

1070
01:26:22,386 --> 01:26:24,136
Stop.

1071
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:28,891
Oh, no! No! Please!

1072
01:26:38,819 --> 01:26:40,361
Stay down.

1073
01:26:52,124 --> 01:26:53,916
Hey! Mary!

1074
01:26:54,084 --> 01:26:55,626
Let's go, get her up!

1075
01:26:56,628 --> 01:26:59,296
Come on, Chuck. Let's go, let's go.

1076
01:27:05,929 --> 01:27:08,347
-Morphine.
-Here. Help in here!

1077
01:27:09,641 --> 01:27:11,267
Hold her down. Hold her down.

1078
01:27:15,313 --> 01:27:25,114
Hold her down.

1079
01:27:33,415 --> 01:27:35,624
-You want the monitor now?
-Stay calm.

1080
01:27:52,559 --> 01:27:54,935
-Hold her, hold her, hold her.
-Need EKG leads.

1081
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:32,431
Upon us all, Hancock.

1082
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:34,558
You're no different.

1083
01:28:39,189 --> 01:28:42,566
Time to shut her down, Hancock.

1084
01:28:42,734 --> 01:28:44,985
lt's been a nice run.

1085
01:29:13,390 --> 01:29:17,351
Oh, we are all
sincerely gonna miss you.

1086
01:29:19,187 --> 01:29:21,146
But it is time for you to move on.

1087
01:29:24,985 --> 01:29:28,028
And maybe to a happier place.

1088
01:29:30,031 --> 01:29:32,533
You can thank me if you want to...

1089
01:29:33,702 --> 01:29:35,327
...superhero.

1090
01:29:45,714 --> 01:29:47,339
You didn't!

1091
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:54,805
Aaron!

1092
01:33:05,538 --> 01:33:10,125
-What about Attila the Hun?
-Completely cross-eyed.

1093
01:33:10,293 --> 01:33:11,376
-Cross-eyed?
-Yep.

1094
01:33:11,544 --> 01:33:14,338
All right,
what about Queen Elizabeth?

1095
01:33:14,506 --> 01:33:18,175
-Needy.
-J.F.K.? What about him?

1096
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:21,220
Oh, yeah.

1097
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:24,598
"Oh, yeah"? Anything more?

1098
01:33:24,766 --> 01:33:27,518
Not like that. l was in Cuba
for the whole missile thing.

1099
01:33:27,685 --> 01:33:28,769
Yeah, hang on.

1100
01:33:30,814 --> 01:33:33,065
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Ray.

1101
01:33:33,233 --> 01:33:35,192
<i>Hey, I've been trying to call you.</i>

1102
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:38,111
Yeah, l was out of cell range.

1103
01:33:38,947 --> 01:33:42,658
-Are you outside?
-Yeah.

1104
01:33:42,826 --> 01:33:46,286
-Look up.
-All right, l'm looking up.

1105
01:33:46,913 --> 01:33:48,872
l'm looking up.

1106
01:33:54,254 --> 01:33:57,089
-Baby?
-What?

1107
01:34:04,514 --> 01:34:06,682
You're gonna change the world.

1108
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:10,269
<i>-Good job, Ray.</i>
-Oh, my God, Ray.

1109
01:34:11,437 --> 01:34:13,981
Hey. Look up.

1110
01:34:14,691 --> 01:34:16,149
Hancock.

1111
01:34:20,697 --> 01:34:22,489
l'm proud of you.

1112
01:34:22,657 --> 01:34:24,491
Thanks.

1113
01:34:26,619 --> 01:34:29,079
Will l get in trouble for that?

1114
01:35:45,323 --> 01:35:47,616
-Freeze!
-Don't move!

1115
01:35:47,784 --> 01:35:49,952
-Oh, my God! Sam! No!
-Drop your weapon, sir!

1116
01:35:50,119 --> 01:35:51,536
Get back! Get back! Get back!

1117
01:35:51,704 --> 01:35:54,206
-Drop it!
-Get back or l'll shoot! Get back!

1118
01:35:54,374 --> 01:35:55,999
Get back! l'm not playing.

1119
01:35:56,417 --> 01:35:59,211
Get back. Get back!

1120
01:35:59,629 --> 01:36:01,922
Damn, Handjob.
Where you come from?

1121
01:36:02,090 --> 01:36:04,257
All right, relax.
Just tell me what you need.

1122
01:36:04,425 --> 01:36:06,760
Tell them cops to take
their guns off of me.

1123
01:36:06,928 --> 01:36:09,179
-All right.
-Tell them to take the guns off me.

1124
01:36:09,347 --> 01:36:11,181
Just take them off.
Lower your weapons.

1125
01:36:11,349 --> 01:36:15,686
You're gonna get us out of here
with that tight-ass Wolverine outfit on.

1126
01:36:16,104 --> 01:36:18,522
Now let's make it happen, asshole.
