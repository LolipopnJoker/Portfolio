00:00:49,273 --> 00:00:50,538
<i>Stardust, go ahead.</i>

3
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,774
<i>Activate the V-10 recorder.</i>

4
00:00:52,776 --> 00:00:53,778
<i>Copy.</i>

5
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,690
<i>Quarter activation complete.</i>

6
00:01:09,692 --> 00:01:10,894
<i>Copy. Thank you.</i>

7
00:01:21,272 --> 00:01:24,439
<i>I know I'm not
an ordinary 10-year-old kid.</i>

8
00:01:24,441 --> 00:01:26,878
<i>I mean, I do ordinary things.</i>

9
00:01:27,844 --> 00:01:30,879
<i>Eat ice cream. Ride my bike.</i>

10
00:01:30,881 --> 00:01:32,950
<i>I'm really good
at playing sports.</i>

11
00:01:33,816 --> 00:01:36,651
<i>Well, on my Xbox.</i>

12
00:01:36,653 --> 00:01:41,689
<i>I love Minecraft, science
and dressing up for Halloween.</i>

13
00:01:41,691 --> 00:01:44,425
<i>I love to lightsaber fight
with my dad.</i>

14
00:01:44,427 --> 00:01:46,827
<i>And watch Star Wars movies
with him.</i>

15
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:50,064
<i>And drive my big sister crazy.</i>

16
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:54,869
<i>And dream about being in outer
space, just like any ordinary kid.</i>

17
00:01:54,871 --> 00:01:58,707
<i>I just don't look ordinary
when I'm doing these things.</i>

18
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:00,978
<i>Not even my birth
was ordinary.</i>

19
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,880
<i>It was hilarious.</i>

20
00:02:05,882 --> 00:02:08,719
<i>Now, how can a birth
be hilarious, you ask?</i>

21
00:02:10,486 --> 00:02:12,054
<i>A teenage doctor helps.</i>

22
00:02:12,056 --> 00:02:13,391
This is my first day.

23
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,090
Nate!

24
00:02:15,092 --> 00:02:19,094
<i>A massive video camera
also aids the situation.</i>

25
00:02:19,096 --> 00:02:22,933
<i>But to really be funny, you need
what all the best jokes have.</i>

26
00:02:23,734 --> 00:02:24,865
<i>A punch line.</i>

27
00:02:24,867 --> 00:02:26,500
He's coming!

28
00:02:41,518 --> 00:02:43,918
Where's the baby going?
Go with the baby!

29
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,522
You need to go, sir.

30
00:02:48,758 --> 00:02:51,893
<i>I've had 27 surgeries
since then.</i>

31
00:02:51,895 --> 00:02:56,465
<i>They've helped me to breathe, to
see, to hear without a hearing aid,</i>

32
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:59,534
<i>and some even helped me
look a bit better.</i>

33
00:02:59,536 --> 00:03:02,536
<i>But none of them
have made me look ordinary.</i>

34
00:03:02,538 --> 00:03:04,940
He said
he doesn't want to go.

35
00:03:04,942 --> 00:03:06,407
But he's ready.

36
00:03:06,409 --> 00:03:07,542
No, he's not ready.

37
00:03:07,544 --> 00:03:09,810
I cannot
home school him forever.

38
00:03:09,812 --> 00:03:12,881
Every year that we wait,
it'll just be harder to start.

39
00:03:12,883 --> 00:03:15,549
This is the first year
of middle school for everyone.

40
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:17,886
He will not be
the only new kid.

41
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:21,655
Okay, well, he's gonna be the
only new kid that looks like him.

42
00:03:21,657 --> 00:03:22,556
Look, will you stop
folding towels

43
00:03:22,558 --> 00:03:24,525
for just one second
and please listen?

44
00:03:24,527 --> 00:03:26,894
It's like leading
a lamb to the slaughter.

45
00:03:26,896 --> 00:03:28,332
And you know it.

46
00:03:30,067 --> 00:03:33,734
<i>I know I'll never
just be an ordinary kid.</i>

47
00:03:33,736 --> 00:03:36,873
<i>Ordinary kids don't make other
kids run away from playgrounds.</i>

48
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:43,814
<i>Ordinary kids don't get stared
at wherever they go.</i>

49
00:03:45,681 --> 00:03:47,584
<i>But it's okay
if you wanna stare, too.</i>

50
00:03:56,894 --> 00:03:58,959
<i>My name is Auggie Pullman.</i>

51
00:03:58,961 --> 00:04:01,431
<i>Next week,
I start fifth grade.</i>

52
00:04:02,932 --> 00:04:06,701
<i>And since I've never been
to real school before,</i>

53
00:04:06,703 --> 00:04:10,640
<i>I'm pretty much totally
and completely petrified.</i>

54
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:53,781
Mrs. Pullman,
so good to see you again.

55
00:04:53,783 --> 00:04:56,086
And you must be Auggie.
What a pleasure to meet you.

56
00:04:56,752 --> 00:04:57,822
I'm Mr. Tushman.

57
00:04:59,088 --> 00:05:00,688
You can laugh about that.

58
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:01,856
Tushman.

59
00:05:01,858 --> 00:05:03,757
I've heard 'em all.

60
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,896
- Tushy. Butt man. Butt face.
- Oh.

61
00:05:07,898 --> 00:05:09,264
Mr. Tuchus.

62
00:05:11,235 --> 00:05:15,070
And then in the
spring, we have a science fair.

63
00:05:15,072 --> 00:05:19,574
And from what your home school teacher
tells me, you'll get first prize.

64
00:05:19,576 --> 00:05:21,543
You hear that, Auggie?

65
00:05:21,545 --> 00:05:24,512
Then right before graduation,
whole class takes a trip

66
00:05:24,514 --> 00:05:26,914
to a nature reserve
in Pennsylvania.

67
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:30,185
It is the highlight
of the year.

68
00:05:30,187 --> 00:05:31,920
I promise you.

69
00:05:31,922 --> 00:05:33,157
Oh good, they're here.

70
00:05:42,798 --> 00:05:44,098
Who are they?

71
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,466
Well, I thought it would be
helpful for you

72
00:05:45,468 --> 00:05:48,570
to meet some of our students
'fore you start school, Auggie.

73
00:05:48,572 --> 00:05:49,673
What do you think?

74
00:05:51,173 --> 00:05:53,007
Other kids now?

75
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:54,409
They were
in the elementary school

76
00:05:54,411 --> 00:05:57,481
so they know their way around and
they'll give you a nice tour.

77
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,951
It will be fine.

78
00:06:07,723 --> 00:06:12,127
Auggie, this is Jack
Will, Julian, and Charlotte.

79
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:14,031
Guys, this is Auggie Pullman.

80
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,933
Hi.

81
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,536
Hey.

82
00:06:20,971 --> 00:06:23,837
<i>Meeting kids is harder
than meeting adults.</i>

83
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:26,608
<i>Everyone makes
the same face at first.</i>

84
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,913
<i>But kids aren't as good
at hiding it.</i>

85
00:06:30,213 --> 00:06:33,348
<i>So I usually look down.</i>

86
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:36,584
<i>You can learn a lot
about people from their shoes.</i>

87
00:06:36,586 --> 00:06:40,024
<i>I think these three are
trust fund kid,</i>

88
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,526
<i>hand-me-down kid...</i>

89
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:45,627
<i>Uh-oh, crazy kid.</i>

90
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:47,695
I act in TV commercials.

91
00:06:47,697 --> 00:06:48,863
Really?

92
00:06:48,865 --> 00:06:51,302
Yeah. Tide.

93
00:06:52,802 --> 00:06:53,801
Why don't you guys

94
00:06:53,803 --> 00:06:55,303
take Auggie 'round
the school a bit, huh?

95
00:06:55,305 --> 00:06:58,175
Just be back here in, uh,
a half hour?

96
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,753
<i>I started
when I was two.</i>

97
00:07:12,755 --> 00:07:14,122
Local spots mostly.

98
00:07:14,124 --> 00:07:17,224
Then when I was three I booked
my first national. Nestlé Quik.

99
00:07:17,226 --> 00:07:19,760
It was hard, because
I'm lactose intolerant.

100
00:07:19,762 --> 00:07:22,062
Anyway, have you ever heard
of a spit bucket?

101
00:07:22,064 --> 00:07:25,336
So this is our homeroom.
We have Mr. Browne.

102
00:07:26,702 --> 00:07:28,969
My mom says
he's a little weird.

103
00:07:28,971 --> 00:07:31,072
Then I was in the chorus of

104
00:07:31,074 --> 00:07:35,276
the Radio City Music Hall
Christmas Spectacular.

105
00:07:35,278 --> 00:07:37,344
I auditioned
for Annie on Broadway.

106
00:07:37,346 --> 00:07:41,115
I got two callbacks for Molly, but I guess
they went in a different direction.

107
00:07:41,117 --> 00:07:42,185
Hey, Charlotte!

108
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,022
Don't you ever stop talking?

109
00:07:45,956 --> 00:07:48,423
So this is the cafeteria.

110
00:07:48,425 --> 00:07:51,892
The food here is okay
for school food.

111
00:07:51,894 --> 00:07:55,231
Or do you eat special food?

112
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:10,911
Wow! This reminds me of my
guess spot on <i>Law & Order.</i>

113
00:08:10,913 --> 00:08:14,115
So the science elective
is supposably really hard.

114
00:08:14,117 --> 00:08:16,216
So you probably won't be
spending much time here.

115
00:08:16,218 --> 00:08:19,187
No offense, but if you've never
been in a real school before...

116
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:21,122
Dude, he's been home schooled.

117
00:08:21,124 --> 00:08:22,923
Okay, I'm just saying.

118
00:08:22,925 --> 00:08:25,325
Science is supposably
really hard.

119
00:08:25,327 --> 00:08:27,461
But you're taking it,
too, right?

120
00:08:27,463 --> 00:08:30,397
Hey,
maybe you could fail together.

121
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:33,036
Why don't you get out of the
way, so he can check it out?

122
00:08:34,437 --> 00:08:35,639
Okay.

123
00:08:37,407 --> 00:08:41,041
I mean, there's nothing much
to see. Desks. Chairs.

124
00:08:41,043 --> 00:08:43,078
The incubator. Bunsen burners.

125
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,282
Those are some
really gross science posters.

126
00:08:46,249 --> 00:08:49,084
Oh! And this is an eraser.

127
00:08:49,086 --> 00:08:51,018
He knows
what an eraser is.

128
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,786
How am I supposed to know
what he knows?

129
00:08:52,788 --> 00:08:54,022
He doesn't say anything.

130
00:08:54,024 --> 00:08:56,027
You know
what an eraser is, right?

131
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,197
Dude,
you have to say something.

132
00:09:01,764 --> 00:09:03,433
Yeah, I know
what an eraser is.

133
00:09:05,936 --> 00:09:10,104
Is... Is your name Jack
or Jackwill?

134
00:09:10,106 --> 00:09:12,306
You thought his name
was Jackwill?

135
00:09:12,308 --> 00:09:15,879
Yeah, a lotta people call me
by my first and last name.

136
00:09:16,413 --> 00:09:18,146
I don't know why.

137
00:09:18,148 --> 00:09:19,379
Got any other questions?

138
00:09:19,381 --> 00:09:22,916
Actually, I've got
a question for Auggie.

139
00:09:22,918 --> 00:09:24,185
What's the deal
with your face?

140
00:09:24,187 --> 00:09:25,185
Dude!

141
00:09:25,187 --> 00:09:26,787
I mean were you
in a car crash or something?

142
00:09:26,789 --> 00:09:28,022
Julian!

143
00:09:28,024 --> 00:09:30,425
What? Tushman said we could
ask questions if we wanted to.

144
00:09:30,427 --> 00:09:31,425
Not rude questions.

145
00:09:31,427 --> 00:09:34,161
Besides, he was born
like that, Mr. Tushman said.

146
00:09:34,163 --> 00:09:37,931
Yeah, I know. I just thought maybe
he was, like, in a fire, too.

147
00:09:37,933 --> 00:09:39,800
Hey, Julian, shut up.

148
00:09:39,802 --> 00:09:40,868
You shut up!

149
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,938
Why don't we all shut up?

150
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,209
No, I wasn't in a fire.

151
00:09:48,144 --> 00:09:49,879
And the word's "supposedly."

152
00:09:51,881 --> 00:09:53,180
What?

153
00:09:53,182 --> 00:09:57,252
You said that science
is supposably really hard.

154
00:09:57,254 --> 00:09:59,286
Twice.

155
00:09:59,288 --> 00:10:02,158
The word's "supposedly."
With a "D."

156
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,097
Maybe my mom
can home school you, too.

157
00:10:20,943 --> 00:10:24,546
Do you wanna tell us yet
how you felt about the tour?

158
00:10:24,548 --> 00:10:25,847
Today?

159
00:10:25,849 --> 00:10:27,415
Mr. Tushman
went out of his way

160
00:10:27,417 --> 00:10:29,217
to tell me how sweet
those kids were

161
00:10:29,219 --> 00:10:32,355
and that Julian
is apparently quite the dream.

162
00:10:33,289 --> 00:10:34,855
No.

163
00:10:34,857 --> 00:10:36,092
Not a dream?

164
00:10:37,124 --> 00:10:39,026
Is he one of those kids that acts
one way in front of grownups

165
00:10:39,028 --> 00:10:41,228
and then another way
in front of kids?

166
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,930
Yeah, I guess.

167
00:10:42,932 --> 00:10:46,434
Well I know it's hard, but
you have to understand that

168
00:10:46,436 --> 00:10:49,337
he probably feels badly
about himself.

169
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:53,340
And when someone acts small, you just
have to be the bigger person, all right?

170
00:10:53,342 --> 00:10:55,478
Right.

171
00:10:57,346 --> 00:10:59,082
Via, I'll get the pizza.

172
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,916
Look at me, Auggie.

173
00:11:01,918 --> 00:11:03,584
That kid sounds like
a real jerk.

174
00:11:03,586 --> 00:11:05,987
If someone pushes you,
push back.

175
00:11:05,989 --> 00:11:07,488
Don't be afraid of anyone.

176
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:09,022
Why are we whispering?

177
00:11:09,024 --> 00:11:10,461
Because I'm afraid of Mom.

178
00:11:11,528 --> 00:11:13,460
You just gotta be
a bigger person

179
00:11:13,462 --> 00:11:17,331
and rise above it.
It's that easy.

180
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:21,603
Auggie, I do believe that this is the
best year for you to start school

181
00:11:21,605 --> 00:11:24,539
because everybody
is going to be new.

182
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,273
But if you really
don't wanna go...

183
00:11:26,275 --> 00:11:29,012
No. It's okay. I wanna go.

184
00:11:31,581 --> 00:11:33,281
You do?

185
00:11:33,283 --> 00:11:34,415
Mmm-hmm.

186
00:11:34,417 --> 00:11:36,550
What changed your mind?

187
00:11:36,552 --> 00:11:38,923
Well they have a really good
science elective.

188
00:11:40,056 --> 00:11:42,390
And I need
a better science teacher.

189
00:11:42,392 --> 00:11:43,958
Oh!

190
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,326
- Oh, wow. There's that.
- Whoa! Whoa!

191
00:11:46,328 --> 00:11:47,929
Are you gonna take that, Mom?

192
00:11:47,931 --> 00:11:48,964
Can I get some backup here?

193
00:11:48,966 --> 00:11:50,165
You gonna let him talk
to your wife like this?

194
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,566
I'm not gonna let him
talk to my wife like that.

195
00:11:52,568 --> 00:11:54,102
- Please!
- Get him! Come on, Via.

196
00:11:54,104 --> 00:11:56,574
Get in there.

197
00:12:24,668 --> 00:12:27,701
I'll meet you right here
after school.

198
00:12:27,703 --> 00:12:29,472
Okay? Right here.

199
00:12:32,075 --> 00:12:33,241
I love you.

200
00:12:33,243 --> 00:12:34,345
Love you, too.

201
00:12:35,211 --> 00:12:36,447
I'll see you later.

202
00:12:42,118 --> 00:12:43,254
Can you hear me?

203
00:12:51,528 --> 00:12:54,195
We're gonna have
a little man-to-man.

204
00:12:54,197 --> 00:12:58,398
Now, I gotta stop here, because
past this point is a No Dad Zone

205
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,070
and you don't wanna walk up with
your parents because it's not cool.

206
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,171
But you're cool.

207
00:13:04,341 --> 00:13:08,544
I know I am, but technically
most dads aren't, so...

208
00:13:09,511 --> 00:13:11,414
And neither are these helmets.

209
00:13:14,985 --> 00:13:16,050
Hey.

210
00:13:16,052 --> 00:13:20,688
Two rules. First, only raise
your hand once a class,

211
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,757
no matter how many answers
you know.

212
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:25,693
Except for science.
Crush that one.

213
00:13:25,695 --> 00:13:26,960
Check.

214
00:13:26,962 --> 00:13:30,598
Second, you're gonna feel like
you're all alone, Auggie.

215
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,036
But you're not.

216
00:13:33,102 --> 00:13:34,669
Check.

217
00:13:34,671 --> 00:13:38,772
Should we lose this? Come on,
costumes are for Halloween.

218
00:13:38,774 --> 00:13:41,211
Prepare for blastoff.

219
00:13:50,386 --> 00:13:51,651
I love you.

220
00:13:51,653 --> 00:13:52,655
Love you, too.

221
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,189
Have fun.

222
00:13:55,191 --> 00:13:56,192
Bye.

223
00:13:59,696 --> 00:14:02,530
<i>Have an
excellent mission and Godspeed.</i>

224
00:14:02,532 --> 00:14:04,268
<i>We are ready
to proceed at this time.</i>

225
00:14:05,201 --> 00:14:08,703
<i>10. 9. 8. 7.</i>

226
00:14:08,705 --> 00:14:11,372
Dear God, please,
make them be nice to him.

227
00:14:11,374 --> 00:14:15,475
<i>4. 3. 2. 1.</i>

228
00:14:23,787 --> 00:14:26,153
<i>My mom always said...</i>

229
00:14:26,155 --> 00:14:28,355
<i>"If you don't like
where you are...</i>

230
00:14:28,357 --> 00:14:30,526
<i>"just picture
where you wanna be."</i>

231
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:38,065
<i>Auggie! Auggie! Auggie!</i>

232
00:14:38,067 --> 00:14:41,768
<i>Auggie! Auggie! Auggie!
Auggie! Auggie!</i>

233
00:14:52,514 --> 00:14:54,283
<i>I can't wait
till Halloween.</i>

234
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:19,140
All right, let's settle down.
Everybody settle down.

235
00:15:19,142 --> 00:15:20,544
Uh... Saved.

236
00:15:21,845 --> 00:15:22,810
Sorry.

237
00:15:22,812 --> 00:15:25,682
Everybody find
your seats? Yes?

238
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,786
Finding our seats. Great.

239
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:38,725
All right, now some of us are lucky
enough to know each other. Yeah?

240
00:15:38,727 --> 00:15:41,695
And, and others are new.
Hi there.

241
00:15:41,697 --> 00:15:47,071
Okay, my name is Mr. Browne
and you're late.

242
00:15:48,804 --> 00:15:51,472
Yeah. I'm so sorry.

243
00:15:51,474 --> 00:15:54,407
I was just helping set up
chairs for the assembly.

244
00:15:54,409 --> 00:15:55,376
Don't worry about it.

245
00:15:55,378 --> 00:15:57,214
Can anybody tell me
what this word means?

246
00:15:57,746 --> 00:15:59,313
Anybody? No?

247
00:15:59,315 --> 00:16:02,315
Precepts are rules
for really important things.

248
00:16:02,317 --> 00:16:03,383
Like mottos.

249
00:16:03,385 --> 00:16:05,920
Like mottos.
Or like famous quotes.

250
00:16:05,922 --> 00:16:09,857
Or like, um, lines
from a fortune cookie. Right?

251
00:16:09,859 --> 00:16:12,627
Precepts can help motivate us.

252
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:14,628
They can help guide us when
we have to make decisions

253
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,329
about really important things.
Okay?

254
00:16:16,331 --> 00:16:17,765
"So why are you talkin' to me
about precepts

255
00:16:17,767 --> 00:16:19,432
"this early in the morning,
Mr. Browne?"

256
00:16:19,434 --> 00:16:20,633
Well, let me tell you.

257
00:16:20,635 --> 00:16:24,238
Because precepts can also
tell us a lot about ourselves.

258
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,473
Who is it that I aspire to be?

259
00:16:26,475 --> 00:16:29,276
That is the question that we should
be asking ourselves all the time.

260
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:31,679
What kind of person am I?

261
00:16:31,681 --> 00:16:33,381
So this is what
we're gonna do.

262
00:16:33,383 --> 00:16:35,882
Um, everyone's gonna come up
with two things

263
00:16:35,884 --> 00:16:38,185
that they think everybody else
should know about them.

264
00:16:38,187 --> 00:16:39,454
All right? I'll go first.

265
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:43,357
Number one, I used to work on
Wall Street. For a long time.

266
00:16:43,359 --> 00:16:48,432
And two, I left Wall Street
to pursue my dream and teach.

267
00:16:48,932 --> 00:16:50,300
Boom, who's next?

268
00:16:51,234 --> 00:16:52,235
Yes.

269
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:54,502
Julian Albans.

270
00:16:54,504 --> 00:16:57,504
And I think it's cool how
you're pursuing your dream.

271
00:16:57,506 --> 00:16:59,809
Thank you very much, Julian.
Let's hear your two things.

272
00:17:00,677 --> 00:17:02,310
Okay.

273
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:06,413
One, I just got <i>Battleground Mystic</i>
on my Wii and it's totally awesome.

274
00:17:06,415 --> 00:17:09,685
And number 2, we got
a ping pong table this summer.

275
00:17:10,686 --> 00:17:12,889
Amazing.
Any questions for Julian?

276
00:17:13,388 --> 00:17:14,587
Yes?

277
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:17,557
Is <i>Battleground Mystic</i>
multiplayer or single player?

278
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:19,392
Let's not
those kinda questions.

279
00:17:19,394 --> 00:17:21,932
Okay, uh...

280
00:17:33,776 --> 00:17:35,008
Hi.

281
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:38,011
My name's August Pullman.

282
00:17:38,013 --> 00:17:39,382
Auggie.

283
00:17:39,949 --> 00:17:41,250
And, um...

284
00:17:42,585 --> 00:17:45,956
I have a sister named Via
and a dog named Daisy.

285
00:17:46,689 --> 00:17:49,257
I love <i>Star Wars.</i>

286
00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:53,995
And I just said three things.
Yeah. Sorry.

287
00:17:53,997 --> 00:17:56,330
That sounds like a bonus
to me. Three things.

288
00:17:56,332 --> 00:17:58,966
Thank you very much, Auggie,
that was perfect. Who's next?

289
00:17:58,968 --> 00:18:02,969
Oh! I actually have
a question for Auggie.

290
00:18:02,971 --> 00:18:05,439
What's the deal with the braid
in the back of your hair?

291
00:18:05,441 --> 00:18:07,440
Is it like a Padawan thing?

292
00:18:07,442 --> 00:18:09,309
What's a Padawan thing?

293
00:18:09,311 --> 00:18:12,848
Oh. It's from <i>Star Wars.</i>
Padawan is a Jedi apprentice.

294
00:18:13,982 --> 00:18:15,818
Who's your favorite character,
Auggie?

295
00:18:16,451 --> 00:18:17,884
Boba Fett.

296
00:18:17,886 --> 00:18:19,956
What about Darth Sidious?
Do you like him?

297
00:18:25,327 --> 00:18:26,594
Ouch.

298
00:18:26,596 --> 00:18:30,463
Okay, can we talk about
<i>Star Wars</i> at recess? Yes?

299
00:18:30,465 --> 00:18:33,366
All right. Who wants to read
this month's precept?

300
00:18:33,368 --> 00:18:34,637
Me! Me! Me!

301
00:18:35,438 --> 00:18:38,572
Me! Me! Me!

302
00:18:38,574 --> 00:18:40,344
What about you?
What's your name?

303
00:18:40,777 --> 00:18:43,076
Summer.

304
00:18:43,078 --> 00:18:44,548
Want to give it a shot?

305
00:18:46,582 --> 00:18:50,287
"When given the choice between
being right or being kind,

306
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,888
"choose kind."

307
00:19:32,595 --> 00:19:33,764
Hey, can I sit there?

308
00:19:34,063 --> 00:19:35,065
Sure!

309
00:19:36,566 --> 00:19:39,403
You eat like the Sarlacc
monster, my young Padawan.

310
00:19:48,678 --> 00:19:52,482
Newton's first law of motion.

311
00:19:54,616 --> 00:19:59,388
An object in motion
will stay in motion unless...

312
00:20:01,624 --> 00:20:03,794
It's okay, I didn't expect you
to know that on the first day.

313
00:20:04,626 --> 00:20:09,700
Acted on by another force.

314
00:20:10,532 --> 00:20:11,998
Very good.

315
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,434
Here's how it works.

316
00:20:14,436 --> 00:20:19,573
<i>A moving object will only
change its speed or direction</i>

317
00:20:19,575 --> 00:20:22,645
<i>if something else
causes it to do that.</i>

318
00:20:36,491 --> 00:20:38,558
Hey Darth Hideous,
did you hear?

319
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,995
Padawan braids were lame
15 years ago.

320
00:20:40,997 --> 00:20:42,863
Supposedly. With a "D."

321
00:20:42,865 --> 00:20:43,930
Dude!

322
00:20:43,932 --> 00:20:45,732
More like
they were always lame.

323
00:20:45,734 --> 00:20:46,801
See you tomorrow.

324
00:20:46,803 --> 00:20:49,406
Later, Barf Hideous!

325
00:20:52,508 --> 00:20:53,574
Hey.

326
00:20:53,576 --> 00:20:54,577
Hey, Mom.

327
00:21:04,787 --> 00:21:05,989
Auggie, you're supposed
to knock.

328
00:21:07,222 --> 00:21:08,924
I'm serious this time.

329
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,932
Wait, did someone
make fun of it?

330
00:21:31,814 --> 00:21:33,550
I, for one, had a great day.

331
00:21:37,854 --> 00:21:41,555
Just trying
to lighten the mood.

332
00:21:41,557 --> 00:21:45,124
Right, Daisy?
Right. Good girl.

333
00:21:45,126 --> 00:21:49,796
Well I went to, um,
Kinko's today

334
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:53,267
to see if they could
get my thesis off this.

335
00:21:53,269 --> 00:21:56,903
You're gonna finish
your dissertation?

336
00:21:56,905 --> 00:21:58,104
What is that?

337
00:21:58,106 --> 00:21:59,172
It's a floppy disk.

338
00:21:59,174 --> 00:22:00,240
A what?

339
00:22:00,242 --> 00:22:02,843
Come on! You, it, a floppy...

340
00:22:02,845 --> 00:22:06,180
These kids today.
It's basically an iPhone.

341
00:22:06,182 --> 00:22:08,716
You know, it doesn't play music
or, you can't call, but...

342
00:22:08,718 --> 00:22:10,551
They couldn't get the file.

343
00:22:10,553 --> 00:22:12,819
That's okay.
You'll find a place.

344
00:22:12,821 --> 00:22:15,189
Well I think it's great, Mom.

345
00:22:15,191 --> 00:22:16,927
Maybe. Thank you.

346
00:22:24,066 --> 00:22:25,802
So Auggie...

347
00:22:26,301 --> 00:22:27,503
Yeah?

348
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:33,210
Hi.

349
00:22:35,076 --> 00:22:36,680
How was your first day
of school?

350
00:22:45,186 --> 00:22:48,057
Earth to Auggie.
We asked you a question.

351
00:22:49,157 --> 00:22:50,690
Come on, how was your day?

352
00:22:50,692 --> 00:22:51,694
Good.

353
00:22:52,795 --> 00:22:55,028
Good how?
Good like it was good?

354
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:57,163
Or good like it was bad and
you just don't wanna tell us?

355
00:22:57,165 --> 00:22:58,899
It was good, okay?
I just don't know

356
00:22:58,901 --> 00:23:00,633
what you want me to say?
It was good!

357
00:23:00,635 --> 00:23:02,736
Okay, okay, hey!
If you're mad at Mom

358
00:23:02,738 --> 00:23:04,604
about going to school,
it was my idea, too.

359
00:23:04,606 --> 00:23:06,942
Why can't I just say "good"
like anybody else?

360
00:23:20,589 --> 00:23:22,826
Battin' a thousand today.

361
00:23:28,897 --> 00:23:30,733
Are they gonna ask
about my day?

362
00:23:36,204 --> 00:23:38,574
That is not the way
we leave the table.

363
00:23:39,976 --> 00:23:42,612
Hey, come on. Talk to me.

364
00:23:44,814 --> 00:23:45,916
Sit down.

365
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:55,959
Take that off, please.

366
00:24:05,367 --> 00:24:06,799
I'm sorry.

367
00:24:06,801 --> 00:24:07,968
It's okay.

368
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:10,004
It'll be okay.

369
00:24:10,006 --> 00:24:12,271
Why do I have to be so ugly?

370
00:24:12,273 --> 00:24:15,174
You are not ugly, Auggie.

371
00:24:15,176 --> 00:24:18,112
You just have to say that
because you're my mom.

372
00:24:18,114 --> 00:24:20,650
Oh, because I'm your mom,
it doesn't count?

373
00:24:21,049 --> 00:24:22,449
Yeah.

374
00:24:22,451 --> 00:24:26,786
Because I'm your mom, it counts the
most because I know you the most.

375
00:24:26,788 --> 00:24:32,258
You are not ugly and anyone who
cares to know you will see that.

376
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,196
They won't even talk to me.

377
00:24:35,931 --> 00:24:38,332
It matters
that I look different.

378
00:24:38,334 --> 00:24:41,203
I try to pretend
that it doesn't, but it does.

379
00:24:41,936 --> 00:24:43,005
I know.

380
00:24:46,008 --> 00:24:47,777
Is it always gonna matter?

381
00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:51,748
I don't know.

382
00:24:56,852 --> 00:24:59,055
Honey, listen...

383
00:25:03,058 --> 00:25:07,262
Look at me.
We all have marks on our face.

384
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:11,364
I have this wrinkle here
from your first surgery.

385
00:25:11,366 --> 00:25:14,770
I have these wrinkles here
from your last surgery.

386
00:25:16,337 --> 00:25:20,009
This is the map that shows us
where we're going.

387
00:25:21,443 --> 00:25:25,845
And this is the map that
shows us where we've been.

388
00:25:25,847 --> 00:25:29,952
And it's never ever ugly.

389
00:25:31,186 --> 00:25:33,222
But what about your gray hair?

390
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,194
That's compliments
of your dad, I think.

391
00:25:54,242 --> 00:25:56,375
And as though we summoned him.

392
00:25:56,377 --> 00:25:59,113
How was your day?

393
00:25:59,115 --> 00:26:03,653
My day is really good
right now.

394
00:26:07,923 --> 00:26:15,194
So they went to Florida, where
Gollum was living in Miami. And...

395
00:26:15,196 --> 00:26:16,430
Oh, you know what it is?

396
00:26:16,432 --> 00:26:18,030
Daddy doesn't have
his glasses on.

397
00:26:18,032 --> 00:26:19,866
You're making this up.

398
00:26:33,315 --> 00:26:35,051
<i>August is the sun.</i>

399
00:26:36,417 --> 00:26:40,821
<i>My mom and dad and me
are planets orbiting the sun.</i>

400
00:26:40,823 --> 00:26:44,194
<i>But I love my brother and I'm used
to the way this universe works.</i>

401
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:54,066
<i>My mom says that on my fourth birthday
I wished for a little brother.</i>

402
00:26:54,068 --> 00:27:00,143
<i>And when he was born, it only took me
a few seconds and I was all over him.</i>

403
00:27:02,278 --> 00:27:03,512
Can you hear me?

404
00:27:04,579 --> 00:27:08,181
If they stare, let them stare.

405
00:27:08,183 --> 00:27:10,920
You can't blend in when you
were born to stand out.

406
00:27:15,257 --> 00:27:18,859
<i>I've never asked my mom
for help with my homework.</i>

407
00:27:18,861 --> 00:27:22,461
<i>I never needed my dad to
remind me to study for a test.</i>

408
00:27:22,463 --> 00:27:26,266
<i>I just did most of my studying
in waiting rooms and hospitals.</i>

409
00:27:26,268 --> 00:27:30,105
<i>Mom and Dad would always say I was the
most understanding girl in the world.</i>

410
00:27:31,606 --> 00:27:34,173
<i>I don't know about that.</i>

411
00:27:34,175 --> 00:27:38,144
<i>I just knew my family
couldn't take one more thing.</i>

412
00:27:38,146 --> 00:27:42,181
<i>I know my family loves me, but
ever since my grandma died,</i>

413
00:27:42,183 --> 00:27:45,053
<i>my best friend Miranda is the
only person who knows me.</i>

414
00:27:47,155 --> 00:27:48,157
Miranda!

415
00:27:49,625 --> 00:27:52,228
Wow. Look at you.

416
00:27:52,862 --> 00:27:54,026
Hey, Via.

417
00:27:54,028 --> 00:27:56,063
I've texted you,
like, 1,000 times.

418
00:27:56,065 --> 00:27:57,400
When'd you get back from camp?

419
00:27:58,534 --> 00:27:59,936
Two weeks ago.

420
00:28:01,502 --> 00:28:02,568
Two weeks?

421
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:06,239
Sorry, it's been crazy.
You know?

422
00:28:06,241 --> 00:28:08,177
Yeah, no, that's okay.

423
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,944
What'd you do to your hair?

424
00:28:11,946 --> 00:28:13,212
Do you like it?

425
00:28:13,214 --> 00:28:17,417
Yeah. Yeah. It looks wild.

426
00:28:17,419 --> 00:28:20,123
Just trying something
different, you know.

427
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,392
I'll catch you later.

428
00:28:25,461 --> 00:28:27,997
- Hey, Ella.
- Hey.

429
00:28:56,291 --> 00:28:57,593
Thinking about signing up?

430
00:28:59,327 --> 00:29:01,228
- For what?
- The drama club.

431
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:04,398
They study theatre in the fall
and do a play in the spring.

432
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,033
Um...

433
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:09,670
No, not really.
I'm not a theatre nerd.

434
00:29:09,672 --> 00:29:12,942
Well,
that's too bad. I am.

435
00:29:13,642 --> 00:29:15,077
I'm Justin by the way.

436
00:29:16,412 --> 00:29:19,412
Sorry, that was...
That was rude. Um...

437
00:29:19,414 --> 00:29:21,584
I'm Via. Olivia.

438
00:29:22,483 --> 00:29:24,186
First days suck, don't they?

439
00:29:26,955 --> 00:29:30,524
Yeah. Yeah, they do.

440
00:29:30,526 --> 00:29:33,693
My mom tried to walk me here
from the subway.

441
00:29:33,695 --> 00:29:35,962
I literally had to ditch her
at the traffic light.

442
00:29:35,964 --> 00:29:38,998
My mom still doesn't think
I can use a MetroCard.

443
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,302
You an only child, too?

444
00:29:42,136 --> 00:29:43,970
Yeah. Yeah.

445
00:29:43,972 --> 00:29:46,506
They never listen.
This one time I told my mom

446
00:29:46,508 --> 00:29:49,543
I wanted to take guitar lessons
and play like Jimi Hendrix.

447
00:29:49,545 --> 00:29:50,580
What happened?

448
00:29:55,483 --> 00:29:58,184
Well it was nice to meet you,
Via. Olivia.

449
00:29:58,186 --> 00:30:01,287
Yeah. It was nice to meet you,
too, Justin.

450
00:30:01,289 --> 00:30:03,323
Maybe, I'll see you around.

451
00:30:03,325 --> 00:30:04,961
Though not onstage, clearly.

452
00:30:27,082 --> 00:30:28,084
Come in.

453
00:30:30,152 --> 00:30:31,220
Good night, honey.

454
00:30:32,453 --> 00:30:33,754
Where's Mom?

455
00:30:33,756 --> 00:30:35,521
She fell asleep.

456
00:30:35,523 --> 00:30:37,025
Oh. Okay.

457
00:30:38,693 --> 00:30:40,393
How's Auggie?

458
00:30:41,663 --> 00:30:44,000
There's some bully, you know.

459
00:30:48,103 --> 00:30:49,404
How was your first day?

460
00:30:51,573 --> 00:30:53,573
It was... It was really good.

461
00:30:53,575 --> 00:30:54,740
It was good?

462
00:30:54,742 --> 00:30:56,176
Yeah.

463
00:30:56,178 --> 00:30:57,680
Say hi to Miranda for us.

464
00:30:59,147 --> 00:31:00,479
I will.

465
00:31:00,481 --> 00:31:01,547
Sweet dreams.

466
00:31:01,549 --> 00:31:02,551
Good night.

467
00:31:27,509 --> 00:31:30,844
<i>My mom put her life
on hold for my brother.</i>

468
00:31:30,846 --> 00:31:35,248
<i>She always wanted to be a children's
book illustrator and teach art.</i>

469
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:40,152
<i>She was one thesis shy of getting
her master's when Auggie was born.</i>

470
00:31:40,154 --> 00:31:44,091
<i>Then she stopped writing it.</i>

471
00:31:44,093 --> 00:31:46,562
<i>She stopped a lot of things
when Auggie was born.</i>

472
00:31:48,596 --> 00:31:52,199
<i>But she is still great
at drawing.</i>

473
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,267
<i>I don't know
if she even realizes that</i>

474
00:31:54,269 --> 00:31:57,640
<i>she makes Auggie the center
of every universe she draws.</i>

475
00:31:59,508 --> 00:32:03,145
<i>Miranda used to joke that
my house was like the Earth.</i>

476
00:32:04,546 --> 00:32:08,084
<i>It revolved around the son.
Not the daughter.</i>

477
00:32:10,251 --> 00:32:13,288
<i>That doesn't change the fact
that my mother has a great eye.</i>

478
00:32:17,259 --> 00:32:22,164
<i>I just wish that one time, she
would use it to look at me.</i>

479
00:32:30,506 --> 00:32:32,442
Yeah, good job, good job.

480
00:32:40,414 --> 00:32:41,517
Miranda?

481
00:32:44,353 --> 00:32:46,756
Via? What are you doing here?

482
00:32:47,722 --> 00:32:50,222
Just trying something new.

483
00:32:50,224 --> 00:32:51,391
You?

484
00:32:51,393 --> 00:32:52,694
Uh, same.

485
00:32:54,429 --> 00:32:55,828
All right,
everybody, let's go!

486
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:56,796
Time for vocal warm up.

487
00:32:56,798 --> 00:32:58,864
Bring it in! Bring it in,
people, let's go!

488
00:32:58,866 --> 00:33:01,834
Everybody, hands up!
Reach high! And...

489
00:33:04,573 --> 00:33:06,640
Guys, can you please...

490
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:13,813
Okay. You... You guys, skooch.
Sit. Just be closer.

491
00:33:13,815 --> 00:33:15,414
Ladies and Gentlemen.

492
00:33:15,416 --> 00:33:17,517
Stay. Stay, good.

493
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,457
Hey, hey. What's your name?

494
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:23,523
Auggie.

495
00:33:23,525 --> 00:33:24,560
Nice boots.

496
00:33:26,595 --> 00:33:29,895
Great. Thanks.

497
00:33:29,897 --> 00:33:35,768
Okay, everybody, here we go. We're
skooching and say "Cheese."

498
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:39,773
Cheese!

499
00:33:39,775 --> 00:33:43,610
<i>School became...
Well, I got used to it.</i>

500
00:33:43,612 --> 00:33:45,478
<i>Except for dodgeball.</i>

501
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,516
<i>What evil man
invented dodgeball?</i>

502
00:33:49,518 --> 00:33:54,220
<i>But my least favorite zone
at school is courtyard.</i>

503
00:33:54,222 --> 00:33:57,489
<i>Because
the whole school's there.</i>

504
00:33:57,491 --> 00:34:01,428
<i>No one does anything mean.
Or says anything. Or laughs.</i>

505
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:05,565
<i>They all just look, then
look away, then look back.</i>

506
00:34:05,567 --> 00:34:07,400
<i>They're just being
normal kids.</i>

507
00:34:07,402 --> 00:34:11,972
<i>I kinda wanna tell them, "Hey, I
know I look weird, but it's okay."</i>

508
00:34:11,974 --> 00:34:15,675
<i>I mean, if Chewbacca started
going to school here one day,</i>

509
00:34:15,677 --> 00:34:17,811
<i>I'd probably stare at him
a bit, too.</i>

510
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:31,523
I'm sorry if my staring
made you feel weird.

511
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:41,900
In order for any of us to see,
we need light.

512
00:34:41,902 --> 00:34:47,673
So right now light is bouncing off
this card traveling through the air,

513
00:34:47,675 --> 00:34:49,775
through the glass,
to your eye.

514
00:34:49,777 --> 00:34:52,247
But what if we added water?

515
00:34:57,885 --> 00:35:00,987
Whoa!

516
00:35:00,989 --> 00:35:02,521
Whoa, indeed.

517
00:35:02,523 --> 00:35:08,961
Any time light passes from one material
or medium to another, it bends.

518
00:35:08,963 --> 00:35:11,733
This bending of light
is also known as...

519
00:35:14,936 --> 00:35:16,469
Refraction.

520
00:35:16,471 --> 00:35:17,539
Very good, Auggie.

521
00:35:19,007 --> 00:35:20,507
Jack, you okay?

522
00:35:20,509 --> 00:35:22,342
Yeah, yeah, refraction.

523
00:35:22,344 --> 00:35:25,845
Good. Clear your desks.
Pop quiz.

524
00:36:03,518 --> 00:36:04,720
Hurry.

525
00:36:37,853 --> 00:36:39,922
Hey, Jack, come sit here.

526
00:36:44,525 --> 00:36:45,694
In a sec.

527
00:36:48,429 --> 00:36:49,698
Where's he goin'?

528
00:36:51,099 --> 00:36:52,164
Hey.

529
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:53,967
Thanks for your help today.

530
00:36:53,969 --> 00:36:55,469
No problem.

531
00:36:55,471 --> 00:36:59,938
And don't worry, I got a couple
wrong so Ms. Petosa wouldn't know.

532
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:03,044
I'm not worried. The worst
they can do is kick me out.

533
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:06,813
Not loving school either, huh?

534
00:37:06,815 --> 00:37:08,148
Oh, it's great.

535
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:11,083
I wanted to go
to Wayne Middle.

536
00:37:11,085 --> 00:37:12,918
The one
with the great sports teams.

537
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,456
Then why'd you come here?

538
00:37:15,489 --> 00:37:16,791
They gave me the scholarship.

539
00:37:20,862 --> 00:37:23,563
Well, if you need help
in science,

540
00:37:23,565 --> 00:37:26,166
you can come to my house
after school.

541
00:37:26,168 --> 00:37:28,802
You know, if you want.

542
00:37:28,804 --> 00:37:30,572
Great. Thanks!

543
00:37:33,574 --> 00:37:35,474
What's wrong?

544
00:37:35,476 --> 00:37:37,911
I just don't like eating
in front of people.

545
00:37:37,913 --> 00:37:39,512
What do you mean?

546
00:37:39,514 --> 00:37:41,680
It's a long story,
but when I eat,

547
00:37:41,682 --> 00:37:44,918
I think I chew like
some prehistoric swamp turtle.

548
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,956
No joke? Me too!

549
00:37:49,891 --> 00:37:51,724
Now there's tuna
on your face.

550
00:37:51,726 --> 00:37:53,760
Yeah! Tuna, man!

551
00:37:53,762 --> 00:37:56,463
No, no, no, let me show you
how it's done.

552
00:38:01,469 --> 00:38:03,471
Dude, that's even more gross.

553
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:20,153
I'm going as Boba Fett
this year.

554
00:38:20,155 --> 00:38:23,722
I like Halloween, but Christmas
is still the best holiday.

555
00:38:23,724 --> 00:38:25,891
No way.
Halloween is the best.

556
00:38:25,893 --> 00:38:28,994
A pillowcase of candy versus
two weeks off school.

557
00:38:28,996 --> 00:38:30,031
You're nuts.

558
00:38:30,831 --> 00:38:32,664
You see?

559
00:38:32,666 --> 00:38:35,034
Even your dog agrees.

560
00:38:35,036 --> 00:38:37,206
Hey, Mom, is it okay
if Jack comes over?

561
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,074
Yes!

562
00:38:41,076 --> 00:38:42,809
Thanks, Mrs. P.

563
00:38:42,811 --> 00:38:45,110
I mean, you get snow
on Christmas.

564
00:38:45,112 --> 00:38:47,514
But you can get snow
on Halloween.

565
00:38:47,516 --> 00:38:49,615
- How?
- If you live in Alaska

566
00:38:49,617 --> 00:38:50,983
or there's a blizzard.

567
00:38:50,985 --> 00:38:52,855
I've got to be cool.

568
00:39:08,969 --> 00:39:11,637
You ever thought about
having plastic surgery?

569
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:14,509
No, I've never
thought about it. Why?

570
00:39:16,311 --> 00:39:19,144
Dude, this is after
plastic surgery!

571
00:39:19,146 --> 00:39:22,180
It takes a lotta work
to look this good.

572
00:39:22,182 --> 00:39:24,650
Oh my God! Oh my God.

573
00:39:24,652 --> 00:39:28,121
1, 2, 3, 4,
I declare a thumb war.

574
00:39:28,123 --> 00:39:30,693
Bow, kiss, begin.

575
00:39:50,277 --> 00:39:51,279
Nate.

576
00:39:53,681 --> 00:39:54,716
Fire.

577
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:07,693
Okay, everybody, if you can't see the
camera, the camera can't see you.

578
00:40:07,695 --> 00:40:09,963
Now let's improv like
we know what we're doing.

579
00:40:09,965 --> 00:40:12,331
Okay, everybody say, "Stella!"

580
00:40:12,333 --> 00:40:14,002
Stella!

581
00:40:23,612 --> 00:40:25,378
So I can't figure you out.

582
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,582
What?

583
00:40:27,282 --> 00:40:29,983
Um, I can't figure you out.

584
00:40:29,985 --> 00:40:31,150
Oh?

585
00:40:31,152 --> 00:40:34,753
Most theatre people won't
stop talking about themselves.

586
00:40:34,755 --> 00:40:36,090
But you don't talk.

587
00:40:37,257 --> 00:40:38,726
I... I listen.

588
00:40:39,693 --> 00:40:40,728
Me, too.

589
00:40:41,161 --> 00:40:42,662
I know.

590
00:40:42,664 --> 00:40:46,231
Oh.
So you do pay attention.

591
00:40:46,233 --> 00:40:48,635
Okay, that's a start. Uh...

592
00:40:48,637 --> 00:40:51,269
I'm a good listener
so tell me something.

593
00:40:51,271 --> 00:40:53,271
Who are you gonna
audition for?

594
00:40:53,273 --> 00:40:56,943
Um, I'm not really
the Our Town type.

595
00:40:56,945 --> 00:41:00,313
Oh come on. Don't be
the "run lights girl."

596
00:41:00,315 --> 00:41:01,684
Should be Emily.

597
00:41:02,349 --> 00:41:03,416
The lead?

598
00:41:03,418 --> 00:41:05,921
Look, your family can't cheer
for you in a booth.

599
00:41:06,721 --> 00:41:08,186
Oh, they're pretty busy.

600
00:41:08,188 --> 00:41:10,322
I don't think they would
cheer for me anyway.

601
00:41:10,324 --> 00:41:12,224
Come on,
there's not one person

602
00:41:12,226 --> 00:41:14,163
in your family
who would applaud you?

603
00:41:15,829 --> 00:41:17,098
My grandmother.

604
00:41:17,965 --> 00:41:19,634
There you go. Bring her.

605
00:41:21,001 --> 00:41:22,070
I can't.

606
00:41:25,139 --> 00:41:27,643
Well, then I'll applaud you.

607
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:32,077
Why are you being
so nice to me?

608
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:35,750
Because you're an only child.
We have to stick together.

609
00:41:38,286 --> 00:41:39,822
Think about it. Okay?

610
00:41:43,458 --> 00:41:46,028
And your grandmother's
still cheerin' you on.

611
00:41:55,369 --> 00:41:56,904
<i>I know you.</i>

612
00:41:58,273 --> 00:42:02,711
And I love you more than
anything in the world.

613
00:42:04,713 --> 00:42:07,280
What about Auggie?

614
00:42:07,282 --> 00:42:08,951
I love your brother.

615
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:14,222
But he has a lot of angels
looking out for him.

616
00:42:15,889 --> 00:42:17,659
And you have me.

617
00:42:20,762 --> 00:42:21,930
Yeah.

618
00:42:24,398 --> 00:42:26,134
You are everywhere.

619
00:42:27,735 --> 00:42:28,737
And...

620
00:42:31,005 --> 00:42:32,340
...you are my favorite.

621
00:42:34,309 --> 00:42:36,278
You're my favorite,
too, Grams.

622
00:43:02,836 --> 00:43:05,204
Mom, Daisy ruined
my Boba Fett costume!

623
00:43:05,206 --> 00:43:08,407
What? Where have you been?
It's very late.

624
00:43:08,409 --> 00:43:10,175
- I'm sorry.
- She threw up all over it.

625
00:43:10,177 --> 00:43:11,376
Okay, well,
you'll just have to wear

626
00:43:11,378 --> 00:43:13,780
- your costume from last year.
- But I told Jack

627
00:43:13,782 --> 00:43:16,014
I was going as Boba Fett,
not Ghostface.

628
00:43:16,016 --> 00:43:19,217
Well, tomorrow is Halloween.
And all the shops are closed.

629
00:43:19,219 --> 00:43:21,387
And my artistic hands are busy
making meatloaf.

630
00:43:21,389 --> 00:43:22,921
So you do the math.

631
00:43:22,923 --> 00:43:23,925
Fine!

632
00:43:26,795 --> 00:43:27,959
Do you need some help, Mom?

633
00:43:27,961 --> 00:43:29,228
What?

634
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:30,396
Some help.

635
00:43:30,398 --> 00:43:33,499
Oh, uh, yes, thank you.

636
00:43:33,501 --> 00:43:35,269
Er, mince that rosemary,
please.

637
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:40,375
Where did you say you were?

638
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:46,181
I, uh...
I went to Coney Island.

639
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:59,124
How about you stay home
from school tomorrow? Hmm?

640
00:43:59,126 --> 00:44:02,061
It's Halloween. We can
make it a 3-day weekend.

641
00:44:02,063 --> 00:44:03,432
Spend some time together.

642
00:44:04,532 --> 00:44:06,367
Yeah. Yeah,
that would be really nice.

643
00:44:07,902 --> 00:44:08,903
Yeah?

644
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:11,072
Okay, good.

645
00:44:13,041 --> 00:44:14,941
Peppers? I don't want peppers.

646
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:16,979
Peppers give Daddy gas.

647
00:44:20,148 --> 00:44:23,418
<i>I don't care what Jack
Will says about Christmas.</i>

648
00:44:24,885 --> 00:44:26,221
Hey, Auggie!

649
00:44:28,289 --> 00:44:32,895
<i>For me, Halloween is
the best holiday in the world.</i>

650
00:44:34,295 --> 00:44:37,162
<i>It's so awesome,
when I'm wearing the costume!</i>

651
00:44:37,164 --> 00:44:40,398
<i>I usually walk with my head
down to avoid being seen.</i>

652
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,338
<i>But on Halloween,
I walk with my head up high.</i>

653
00:44:51,012 --> 00:44:53,112
<i>I don't even know
who that was.</i>

654
00:44:53,114 --> 00:44:55,914
<i>He didn't even know
who I was. It's so cool.</i>

655
00:44:55,916 --> 00:44:58,217
<i>Especially because people
don't like to touch me</i>

656
00:44:58,219 --> 00:45:00,653
<i>because they think
I'm contagious.</i>

657
00:45:00,655 --> 00:45:04,993
<i>Oh, yeah, Chewie! Up high!
Boom goes the dynamite!</i>

658
00:45:12,065 --> 00:45:14,400
It really does look like him.

659
00:45:14,402 --> 00:45:16,068
- This part right?
- Yeah.

660
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:19,572
I mean, he's always reminded me
of, like, the shrunken head, you know?

661
00:45:19,574 --> 00:45:21,173
- Or an orc.
- Yeah.

662
00:45:21,175 --> 00:45:22,575
If I looked like him,
I'd swear

663
00:45:22,577 --> 00:45:23,742
I'd put a hood over my face
every day.

664
00:45:23,744 --> 00:45:27,313
If I looked like him,
I think I'd kill myself.

665
00:45:27,315 --> 00:45:29,014
Why do you hang out with him
so much, Jack?

666
00:45:29,016 --> 00:45:30,148
Yeah.

667
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:31,152
I dunno.

668
00:45:32,452 --> 00:45:34,487
Tushman asked me
to be his welcome buddy

669
00:45:34,489 --> 00:45:37,490
and now he just
follows me around everywhere.

670
00:45:37,492 --> 00:45:40,059
Well, that must stink!
That must stink.

671
00:45:41,362 --> 00:45:43,128
Oh, yeah. Just like him.

672
00:45:57,277 --> 00:45:59,247
<i>Nobody puts Baby
in the corner.</i>

673
00:46:03,351 --> 00:46:07,552
Always blows my mind how much Daddy looks
like Patrick Swayze in this movie.

674
00:46:07,554 --> 00:46:10,088
Ew!

675
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:11,525
Ew, no!

676
00:46:13,695 --> 00:46:15,664
Honey, tell me
what's going on with Miranda?

677
00:46:17,532 --> 00:46:20,469
It's not just the pink hair.

678
00:46:21,135 --> 00:46:23,235
She's just...

679
00:46:23,237 --> 00:46:25,072
She won't even talk to me.

680
00:46:26,407 --> 00:46:28,273
I had a friend in high school.

681
00:46:28,275 --> 00:46:30,342
We went through
this exact same thing.

682
00:46:30,344 --> 00:46:33,278
And what I did, which fixed it
almost immediately...

683
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,514
Yeah?

684
00:46:34,516 --> 00:46:40,489
Was, um, to eat an entire
jack-o'-lantern bucket of candy.

685
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:47,695
Mmm. Hello.

686
00:46:48,628 --> 00:46:50,197
Yes, Mr. Tushman.

687
00:46:51,733 --> 00:46:53,432
He's nauseous?

688
00:46:53,434 --> 00:46:54,937
Does he have a fever?

689
00:46:55,737 --> 00:46:57,269
What did the nurse say?

690
00:46:57,271 --> 00:46:58,369
I'm so sorry.

691
00:46:58,371 --> 00:47:02,273
All right. Okay. Thank you.
I will be right there.

692
00:47:02,275 --> 00:47:05,079
Honey, I have to go, your brother
just threw up at school.

693
00:47:25,733 --> 00:47:28,099
<i>Nate, do you know
where his helmet is?</i>

694
00:47:28,101 --> 00:47:30,735
<i>He's asking for it
and I've looked everywhere.</i>

695
00:47:30,737 --> 00:47:32,371
I don't know.
Something at school.

696
00:47:32,373 --> 00:47:33,738
He won't say.
He won't come out of his room.

697
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:36,478
And now he says he doesn't even
wanna go trick-or-treating.

698
00:47:37,612 --> 00:47:40,514
I know. Okay. Thank you.
Just get here.

699
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:57,762
Come on, get ready.

700
00:47:57,764 --> 00:47:59,764
It's almost time
for the Halloween parade.

701
00:47:59,766 --> 00:48:01,168
You're supposed to knock!

702
00:48:02,737 --> 00:48:05,206
Go away!

703
00:48:07,641 --> 00:48:10,742
Mom says you won't say
what happened.

704
00:48:10,744 --> 00:48:13,311
Did someone say something?

705
00:48:13,313 --> 00:48:15,481
Someone always says something!

706
00:48:15,483 --> 00:48:16,715
Well tell me what happened.

707
00:48:16,717 --> 00:48:18,416
It's none of your business!

708
00:48:18,418 --> 00:48:21,589
You took my day with Mom,
so it is my business.

709
00:48:23,324 --> 00:48:26,758
I heard Jack Will talking
about me behind my back.

710
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:29,561
He said he'd kill himself
if he looked like me.

711
00:48:29,563 --> 00:48:33,398
Jack Will?
Isn't he the nice one?

712
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,633
There are no nice ones!

713
00:48:35,635 --> 00:48:38,304
I wish I'd never gone
to school in the first place!

714
00:48:38,306 --> 00:48:40,673
But you were liking school.
I know you were.

715
00:48:40,675 --> 00:48:42,711
I hate it, okay? I hate it.

716
00:48:46,646 --> 00:48:51,182
Auggie, I'm sorry, but you're not
the only one who has bad days.

717
00:48:51,184 --> 00:48:55,387
Bad days?
Do people avoid touching you?

718
00:48:55,389 --> 00:48:58,693
When a person accidentally touches
you, do they call it "the plague"?

719
00:48:59,494 --> 00:49:00,659
No.

720
00:49:00,661 --> 00:49:01,927
Jack Will was all I had.

721
00:49:01,929 --> 00:49:05,664
So just don't compare your bad
days at school to mine, okay?

722
00:49:05,666 --> 00:49:06,701
Okay.

723
00:49:12,773 --> 00:49:14,039
Hey.

724
00:49:14,041 --> 00:49:17,175
Did you notice that Miranda
doesn't come around any more?

725
00:49:17,177 --> 00:49:18,376
What?

726
00:49:18,378 --> 00:49:20,714
You didn't. Shocker.

727
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,617
Yeah she went away
to camp this summer

728
00:49:24,619 --> 00:49:26,719
and now
she doesn't like me anymore.

729
00:49:26,721 --> 00:49:27,722
Why?

730
00:49:28,722 --> 00:49:31,293
Because school sucks.

731
00:49:32,226 --> 00:49:34,325
And people change.

732
00:49:34,327 --> 00:49:37,865
So if you wanna be a normal kid,
Auggie, then those are the rules.

733
00:49:39,199 --> 00:49:42,403
So let's go trick-or-treating.

734
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:45,204
Okay?

735
00:49:45,206 --> 00:49:49,177
Because right now we're
each other's best friends.

736
00:49:52,612 --> 00:49:53,681
Really?

737
00:49:54,248 --> 00:49:55,250
Yes.

738
00:49:55,715 --> 00:49:58,487
So come on.

739
00:49:59,954 --> 00:50:02,289
I'll let you have
all my Halloween candy.

740
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:08,293
I'll trade you
my apples.

741
00:50:08,295 --> 00:50:09,728
Okay, no.

742
00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:11,664
I know that I said that
you could have all my candy,

743
00:50:11,666 --> 00:50:14,266
but I was really just saying that
to get you out of the house.

744
00:50:14,268 --> 00:50:15,367
What about
the chocolate?

745
00:50:15,369 --> 00:50:16,735
- No.
- And the Smarties?

746
00:50:16,737 --> 00:50:19,237
Gummis, licorice,
the Reese's, the Hersheys.

747
00:50:19,239 --> 00:50:20,773
- No!
- And everything else.

748
00:50:20,775 --> 00:50:23,278
All right, I'll let you have
all my candy.

749
00:50:28,548 --> 00:50:30,382
<i>Okay, Via.</i>

750
00:50:30,384 --> 00:50:33,219
You are next please.
Let's hear it for Via.

751
00:50:58,878 --> 00:51:00,214
Daisy,

752
00:51:01,748 --> 00:51:04,852
do you wanna help me
take back my corner office?

753
00:51:14,728 --> 00:51:17,264
Hey, Auggie!
You feeling better?

754
00:51:20,434 --> 00:51:22,938
Are you okay, Auggie?

755
00:51:24,304 --> 00:51:25,737
Yeah.

756
00:51:25,739 --> 00:51:28,340
Sure? 'Cause you're acting
really weird.

757
00:51:28,342 --> 00:51:29,744
I'm okay, Jack, okay?

758
00:51:33,047 --> 00:51:34,349
Okay.

759
00:51:45,925 --> 00:51:47,760
They want me to do what?

760
00:51:47,762 --> 00:51:50,295
Give a tour
through the school.

761
00:51:50,297 --> 00:51:52,530
But Mom, it's summer vacation.

762
00:51:52,532 --> 00:51:53,932
I know.

763
00:51:53,934 --> 00:51:56,834
But your teachers told Mr. Tushman
you're known as a good egg.

764
00:51:56,836 --> 00:51:59,737
- No, I'm a bad egg.
- You're a good egg.

765
00:51:59,739 --> 00:52:02,974
And I'm actually really proud
they thought of you for this.

766
00:52:02,976 --> 00:52:05,344
Mom, enough with the guilt.

767
00:52:05,346 --> 00:52:07,014
And you know they gave you
a scholarship, right?

768
00:52:07,581 --> 00:52:08,849
Mom...

769
00:52:12,085 --> 00:52:13,985
Who else is doing it?

770
00:52:13,987 --> 00:52:16,454
Uh, Charlotte and Julian.

771
00:52:16,456 --> 00:52:18,090
- No.
- Why, what's wrong?

772
00:52:18,092 --> 00:52:21,526
Charlotte will just talk about
Broadway the whole time.

773
00:52:21,528 --> 00:52:24,429
And Julian is the biggest
phony on the planet.

774
00:52:24,431 --> 00:52:26,467
So I'm sorry, but no.

775
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,072
Jack, it's for that boy.

776
00:52:34,074 --> 00:52:35,541
Who?

777
00:52:35,543 --> 00:52:37,778
The one
from the ice cream shop.

778
00:52:39,813 --> 00:52:40,914
Oh.

779
00:52:41,481 --> 00:52:42,782
Yeah.

780
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:46,918
So if a nice kid like your little
brother cries when he sees him,

781
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,523
what kind of a chance do you
think he has in middle school?

782
00:52:55,061 --> 00:52:56,463
Okay.

783
00:52:57,797 --> 00:52:59,000
Thank you, kiddo.

784
00:53:05,505 --> 00:53:08,106
<i>Four things I've learned
about Auggie Pullman.</i>

785
00:53:08,108 --> 00:53:12,043
<i>First of all,
you do get used to his face.</i>

786
00:53:12,045 --> 00:53:14,112
Now,
it's not like regular ice.

787
00:53:14,114 --> 00:53:16,414
You can't touch it
with your hands, okay?

788
00:53:16,416 --> 00:53:19,851
<i>Second,
he's really smart.</i>

789
00:53:19,853 --> 00:53:22,787
<i>He's ahead of me
in everything.</i>

790
00:53:22,789 --> 00:53:25,657
<i>In science, he's ahead
of the whole school.</i>

791
00:53:25,659 --> 00:53:27,061
Everybody watching?

792
00:53:27,862 --> 00:53:29,795
Whoo!

793
00:53:29,797 --> 00:53:33,501
<i>Third of all,
he's actually pretty funny.</i>

794
00:53:34,601 --> 00:53:37,436
<i>But fourthly,
now that I know him,</i>

795
00:53:37,438 --> 00:53:40,671
<i>I would say I actually do
wanna be friends with Auggie.</i>

796
00:53:40,673 --> 00:53:42,874
<i>At first, I admit it,</i>

797
00:53:42,876 --> 00:53:45,880
<i>I was only friendly to him because
my mom asked me to be nice.</i>

798
00:53:47,914 --> 00:53:51,717
<i>But now I would choose
to hang out with him.</i>

799
00:53:51,719 --> 00:53:53,985
<i>Like, he's a good friend.</i>

800
00:53:53,987 --> 00:53:57,423
<i>Like if all the guys in fifth grade
were lined up against a wall</i>

801
00:53:57,425 --> 00:54:01,896
<i>and I could choose anyone I wanted to
hang out with, I would choose Auggie.</i>

802
00:54:04,764 --> 00:54:06,532
Hey, what's wrong?

803
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:08,099
Go away.

804
00:54:08,101 --> 00:54:10,735
Oh, hey, Jack,
come sit with us.

805
00:54:10,737 --> 00:54:11,839
Yeah, come on, man.

806
00:54:16,443 --> 00:54:18,010
I wonder what happened.

807
00:54:18,012 --> 00:54:19,177
Maybe
Jack touched Auggie

808
00:54:19,179 --> 00:54:20,612
and couldn't
wash his hands in time.

809
00:54:20,614 --> 00:54:22,046
Jack finally got "the plague."

810
00:54:22,048 --> 00:54:24,182
That's not very nice.

811
00:54:24,184 --> 00:54:26,217
What? We didn't start it.

812
00:54:26,219 --> 00:54:27,654
Where you going?

813
00:54:34,994 --> 00:54:37,463
Hi. I'm Summer.

814
00:54:37,465 --> 00:54:40,199
I know.
We're in the same homeroom.

815
00:54:40,201 --> 00:54:42,467
You don't have to do this.

816
00:54:42,469 --> 00:54:44,135
Do what?

817
00:54:44,137 --> 00:54:46,137
You don't have to be
my friend.

818
00:54:46,139 --> 00:54:48,005
I know Tushman talked to you.

819
00:54:48,007 --> 00:54:50,008
I don't know what you're
talking about, Auggie.

820
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:53,144
I know Tushman talked to some
kids before school started

821
00:54:53,146 --> 00:54:55,213
and told them they had to be
friends with me.

822
00:54:55,215 --> 00:54:56,882
He didn't talk to me.

823
00:54:56,884 --> 00:54:58,217
Yeah, he did.

824
00:54:58,219 --> 00:54:59,584
No, he did not.

825
00:54:59,586 --> 00:55:00,751
Yeah, he did.

826
00:55:00,753 --> 00:55:02,554
No, he didn't,
I swear on my life!

827
00:55:02,556 --> 00:55:05,891
Okay, okay.
You don't have to get mad.

828
00:55:05,893 --> 00:55:08,659
I don't like being
accused of things, okay?

829
00:55:08,661 --> 00:55:10,061
Okay. I'm sorry.

830
00:55:10,063 --> 00:55:11,432
You should be.

831
00:55:13,634 --> 00:55:15,867
- He really didn't talk to you?
- Auggie!

832
00:55:15,869 --> 00:55:18,539
Okay, I just...
Why are you sitting here then?

833
00:55:20,708 --> 00:55:22,811
Because I want some
nice friends for a change.

834
00:55:23,677 --> 00:55:25,010
Me, too.

835
00:55:25,012 --> 00:55:26,481
Cool beans.

836
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:29,483
But you'll get "the plague."

837
00:55:29,916 --> 00:55:31,018
Good.

838
00:55:34,722 --> 00:55:35,924
Summer has "the plague."

839
00:55:36,623 --> 00:55:37,658
Shut up!

840
00:55:40,927 --> 00:55:42,763
So what happened
with Jack Will?

841
00:55:43,864 --> 00:55:44,999
Promise you won't tell?

842
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:50,903
I got it! I got the part!

843
00:55:50,905 --> 00:55:52,907
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

844
00:55:55,876 --> 00:55:59,644
She got it! She got the part!
Oh, my God! Bet she got Emily.

845
00:55:59,646 --> 00:56:01,546
Yep.

846
00:56:01,548 --> 00:56:02,550
What'd you get?

847
00:56:03,684 --> 00:56:06,584
Emily's understudy.

848
00:56:06,586 --> 00:56:10,856
I'm not saying poison or anything,
but just a little Benadryl

849
00:56:10,858 --> 00:56:12,324
to knock Miranda out
before the show.

850
00:56:12,326 --> 00:56:14,559
Okay, enough.

851
00:56:14,561 --> 00:56:18,930
Look, just learn her lines and it'll
give us an excuse to hang out more.

852
00:56:18,932 --> 00:56:22,503
We can start rehearsing
the kissing scene on page 110.

853
00:56:23,603 --> 00:56:26,039
Wait. George and Emily?

854
00:56:30,744 --> 00:56:32,747
There is no page 110.

855
00:56:34,782 --> 00:56:39,584
So I'm thinking, I really
wanna kiss you right now.

856
00:56:39,586 --> 00:56:41,623
But I don't know
how you'll respond.

857
00:56:59,172 --> 00:57:00,207
What's wrong?

858
00:57:04,777 --> 00:57:06,313
I'm not an only child.

859
00:57:10,884 --> 00:57:11,983
Mom?

860
00:57:11,985 --> 00:57:14,688
One sec, Via.
Auggie, let's go!

861
00:57:18,257 --> 00:57:20,627
I thought
you were at the library.

862
00:57:21,161 --> 00:57:22,827
Er, um...

863
00:57:22,829 --> 00:57:24,264
Yeah, change of plans.

864
00:57:26,065 --> 00:57:27,365
Hi, I'm Justin.

865
00:57:27,367 --> 00:57:28,702
I'm Isabel.

866
00:57:30,704 --> 00:57:33,708
Daisy threw up again.
Bucket loads.

867
00:57:35,108 --> 00:57:36,577
Bucket loads.

868
00:57:38,978 --> 00:57:41,782
Um, Justin, this is
my little brother Auggie.

869
00:57:43,117 --> 00:57:45,784
- Hey, dude!
- Hey.

870
00:57:45,786 --> 00:57:48,956
What's that in your case?
A machine gun?

871
00:57:51,057 --> 00:57:54,191
Er, no. It's a fiddle.

872
00:57:54,193 --> 00:57:55,994
You should tell people
it's a machine gun.

873
00:57:55,996 --> 00:57:57,865
That's way cooler.

874
00:57:58,831 --> 00:57:59,998
You know what?

875
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,999
That's a great idea,
you're right.

876
00:58:02,001 --> 00:58:03,434
We're on our way
to the grocery.

877
00:58:03,436 --> 00:58:04,836
Mom's making...
What's it called?

878
00:58:04,838 --> 00:58:05,903
Feijoada.

879
00:58:05,905 --> 00:58:07,171
Feij... Mom's making feijoada.

880
00:58:07,173 --> 00:58:08,173
It's Dad's favorite.

881
00:58:08,175 --> 00:58:10,307
You're welcome to stay
if you want, Justin.

882
00:58:10,309 --> 00:58:12,677
Oh, thank you very much.
It was nice meeting you.

883
00:58:12,679 --> 00:58:13,847
Nice to meet you, too.

884
00:58:18,284 --> 00:58:20,117
Psst. Oy!

885
00:58:20,119 --> 00:58:21,286
Bye, Auggie.

886
00:58:21,288 --> 00:58:22,923
Nothing to see here.

887
00:58:29,429 --> 00:58:32,296
It's a gene.
Well, it's sort of two genes,

888
00:58:32,298 --> 00:58:33,898
but two genes
that are identical.

889
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:35,900
And the trouble is
that both of my parents

890
00:58:35,902 --> 00:58:38,704
carry the gene
at the same time, which is...

891
00:58:38,706 --> 00:58:41,706
Well essentially,
he won the lottery.

892
00:58:41,708 --> 00:58:43,407
Backwards or something.

893
00:58:43,409 --> 00:58:48,682
And in another world,
I'd look like him.

894
00:58:53,253 --> 00:58:56,391
I'm sorry for telling you
that I was an only child.

895
00:58:57,858 --> 00:59:00,728
Sometimes it's nice
to hide a little.

896
00:59:01,894 --> 00:59:04,032
I get it. It's okay.

897
00:59:38,297 --> 00:59:39,164
Hello?

898
00:59:39,166 --> 00:59:41,266
<i>Major Tom, is that you?</i>

899
00:59:41,268 --> 00:59:42,434
Miranda!

900
00:59:42,436 --> 00:59:44,838
<i>It's so great
to hear your voice again.</i>

901
00:59:45,505 --> 00:59:47,472
Sorry, Via's not here.

902
00:59:47,474 --> 00:59:50,342
<i>I was actually calling
to say hello to you.</i>

903
00:59:50,344 --> 00:59:51,476
<i>How have you been?</i>

904
00:59:51,478 --> 00:59:54,311
Good. Did you know I'm going
to a regular school now?

905
00:59:54,313 --> 00:59:55,947
<i>No way.</i>

906
00:59:55,949 --> 00:59:57,349
Do you like it?

907
00:59:57,351 --> 00:59:59,083
<i>Yeah, I guess.</i>

908
00:59:59,085 --> 01:00:01,121
<i>It's not as hard
as Mom's home school.</i>

909
01:00:01,855 --> 01:00:03,057
Yeah, I'll bet.

910
01:00:04,458 --> 01:00:06,291
How are the kids?
Are they nice?

911
01:00:06,293 --> 01:00:09,094
<i>No. But I made one friend.</i>

912
01:00:09,096 --> 01:00:10,394
<i>Her name's Summer.</i>

913
01:00:10,396 --> 01:00:12,463
<i>We started
a summer names club.</i>

914
01:00:12,465 --> 01:00:15,934
<i>Summer, August. Get it?</i>

915
01:00:15,936 --> 01:00:17,438
Good for you, Auggie.

916
01:00:19,005 --> 01:00:22,139
Um, where's Via, anyway?

917
01:00:22,141 --> 01:00:23,744
<i>She's out with her boyfriend.</i>

918
01:00:24,911 --> 01:00:26,878
Really?

919
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,751
<i>Yeah. We met him last week.
He's super nice.</i>

920
01:00:34,987 --> 01:00:37,155
I've missed you, Major Tom.

921
01:00:37,157 --> 01:00:38,793
<i>I miss you too, Miranda.</i>

922
01:00:41,128 --> 01:00:44,229
And can you tell Via
that I've missed her, too?

923
01:00:44,231 --> 01:00:47,201
<i>Well, but why don't you just
tell her yourself?</i>

924
01:00:49,936 --> 01:00:53,438
Listen, I gotta go, my mom's
calling me, but, um,

925
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,074
you know that you can call me
any time, right?

926
01:00:56,076 --> 01:00:57,077
<i>Yeah.</i>

927
01:00:59,378 --> 01:01:01,479
Okay, so call me any time.

928
01:01:01,481 --> 01:01:02,914
<i>I will.</i>

929
01:01:02,916 --> 01:01:05,115
Merry Christmas, Auggie.

930
01:01:05,117 --> 01:01:06,820
<i>Merry Christmas, Miranda.</i>

931
01:01:30,043 --> 01:01:32,878
- Get after it.
- Open it. Rip it apart.

932
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:35,880
<i>Via and I have been
best friends since kindergarten.</i>

933
01:01:35,882 --> 01:01:37,316
Oh, my God!

934
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:40,517
<i>Her family's always
been like my second family.</i>

935
01:01:40,519 --> 01:01:42,586
<i>Auggie's always felt
like my little brother.</i>

936
01:01:42,588 --> 01:01:44,090
How does it feel?

937
01:01:44,557 --> 01:01:46,425
- Awesome.
- Good.

938
01:01:46,427 --> 01:01:50,295
<i>And for a few years even our
family's spent Christmas together.</i>

939
01:01:50,297 --> 01:01:52,229
Everybody say
"Merry Christmas"!

940
01:01:52,231 --> 01:01:54,335
Merry Christmas!

941
01:01:56,302 --> 01:01:59,503
<i>But now my dad's busy
with his new wife.</i>

942
01:01:59,505 --> 01:02:01,375
<i>Who was his old boss.</i>

943
01:02:03,409 --> 01:02:07,248
<i>And my mom, well, she's busy
not getting over that.</i>

944
01:02:11,351 --> 01:02:13,318
<i>I got a job at a summer camp.</i>

945
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:15,856
<i>Just so I'd have somewhere
to go that wasn't home.</i>

946
01:02:18,324 --> 01:02:22,626
<i>One day, and I swear
I didn't plan this, but...</i>

947
01:02:22,628 --> 01:02:27,335
<i>I started playing this little make
believe game with the girls in the camp.</i>

948
01:02:29,135 --> 01:02:32,037
<i>I said I lived
in a huge brownstone.</i>

949
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:34,171
<i>On a nice street.</i>

950
01:02:34,173 --> 01:02:37,342
<i>With my two awesome parents.</i>

951
01:02:37,344 --> 01:02:40,445
<i>And my awesome dog
named Daisy.</i>

952
01:02:40,447 --> 01:02:45,253
<i>And my awesome little brother
with a facial deformity.</i>

953
01:02:47,987 --> 01:02:50,621
<i>And, oh, my God,
everyone went crazy.</i>

954
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:52,324
<i>"What do you mean,
'deformity'?</i>

955
01:02:52,326 --> 01:02:53,594
<i>"What does he look like?"</i>

956
01:02:55,161 --> 01:02:57,695
<i>Suddenly,
everyone wanted to talk to me.</i>

957
01:02:57,697 --> 01:03:02,068
<i>And by the end of summer, I was
the most popular girl in camp.</i>

958
01:03:03,603 --> 01:03:06,637
<i>When I got home,
I wanted to call Via.</i>

959
01:03:06,639 --> 01:03:11,077
<i>But she would've asked me about
my parents and about camp.</i>

960
01:03:12,411 --> 01:03:15,512
<i>And then I saw Via audition
for the play.</i>

961
01:03:15,514 --> 01:03:18,483
<i>And I remembered
how cool she is.</i>

962
01:03:18,485 --> 01:03:21,353
<i>And how I understood
why everyone in camp</i>

963
01:03:21,355 --> 01:03:24,057
<i>loved me more
when I pretended to be her.</i>

964
01:03:25,625 --> 01:03:30,061
<i>She used to let Auggie
hang out with us all the time.</i>

965
01:03:30,063 --> 01:03:32,700
<i>I was the one who bought him
his astronaut helmet.</i>

966
01:03:34,201 --> 01:03:37,469
<i>He was so into outer space.</i>

967
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:40,708
<i>And I wanted him to know that the
world was bigger than his room.</i>

968
01:03:43,043 --> 01:03:47,213
<i>And now he's out there.
And I didn't even know.</i>

969
01:03:49,016 --> 01:03:53,988
<i>I could've helped him.
Maybe he could've helped me.</i>

970
01:03:55,222 --> 01:03:56,390
<i>I don't know.</i>

971
01:03:58,224 --> 01:04:00,624
<i>But I could sure use
some help right now.</i>

972
01:04:34,161 --> 01:04:36,427
That was awesome!

973
01:04:38,431 --> 01:04:40,333
Hey, look, there's Jack Will.

974
01:04:44,103 --> 01:04:47,072
Let's find another hill.

975
01:04:47,074 --> 01:04:49,374
You can't just keep
avoiding him forever, Auggie.

976
01:04:49,376 --> 01:04:50,611
Come on, let's go!

977
01:05:13,233 --> 01:05:19,104
9. 8. 7.
6. 5. 4.

978
01:05:19,106 --> 01:05:23,675
3. 2. 1. Happy New Year!

979
01:05:25,811 --> 01:05:28,449
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

980
01:05:53,405 --> 01:05:57,177
Thanks for the help, Daisy.
Way to put your back into it.

981
01:06:05,385 --> 01:06:07,519
What about you?

982
01:06:07,521 --> 01:06:10,188
Christmas was awesome.
We drove up into the mountains

983
01:06:10,190 --> 01:06:12,690
where they had the most
amazing snow I've ever seen.

984
01:06:12,692 --> 01:06:14,492
- It was like powder.
- Nice.

985
01:06:14,494 --> 01:06:15,626
What about you, Jack?

986
01:06:15,628 --> 01:06:18,662
I went up Skeleton Hill.
It was the best.

987
01:06:18,664 --> 01:06:19,764
Skeleton Hill?

988
01:06:19,766 --> 01:06:20,898
I hate that place!

989
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:22,434
Should be called Garbage Hill.

990
01:06:22,436 --> 01:06:26,503
I know, right? I left my old lightning
sled up there last time I was up.

991
01:06:26,505 --> 01:06:28,706
It was the crappiest
piece o' junk.

992
01:06:28,708 --> 01:06:30,941
Went back the next day
and someone had taken it.

993
01:06:30,943 --> 01:06:32,876
Hey, maybe a homeless
guy wanted to go sledding.

994
01:06:32,878 --> 01:06:34,711
Yeah.

995
01:06:34,713 --> 01:06:36,347
<i>New precept.</i>

996
01:06:36,349 --> 01:06:38,715
Your deeds are your monuments.

997
01:06:38,717 --> 01:06:40,784
Archaeologists found
these words inscribed

998
01:06:40,786 --> 01:06:42,686
on the walls
of an ancient Egyptian tomb.

999
01:06:42,688 --> 01:06:44,557
Can anybody tell me
what they mean?

1000
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:47,862
Summer?

1001
01:06:48,661 --> 01:06:50,230
Oh, uh...

1002
01:06:51,965 --> 01:06:54,331
I think it means
that the things we do

1003
01:06:54,333 --> 01:06:56,266
are the things
that matter most.

1004
01:06:56,268 --> 01:06:58,771
Excellent.
Anybody else?

1005
01:07:01,974 --> 01:07:03,877
Hey, Summer.

1006
01:07:04,744 --> 01:07:06,447
Hey. You okay?

1007
01:07:07,213 --> 01:07:09,583
Yeah. Fine. Just...

1008
01:07:10,784 --> 01:07:12,920
This is gonna
sound stupid, but...

1009
01:07:14,487 --> 01:07:17,287
do you know why
Auggie stopped liking me?

1010
01:07:17,289 --> 01:07:19,224
You should ask him.

1011
01:07:19,226 --> 01:07:24,229
I have, but ever since Halloween,
he just won't talk to me.

1012
01:07:24,231 --> 01:07:27,865
I mean... You know what?
I don't care. Sorry.

1013
01:07:27,867 --> 01:07:28,903
Ghostface.

1014
01:07:31,237 --> 01:07:32,903
Wait, wait, what?

1015
01:07:32,905 --> 01:07:34,440
That's all I can tell you.

1016
01:07:39,012 --> 01:07:40,445
Okay...

1017
01:07:40,447 --> 01:07:42,280
Now that we've finished
our tests,

1018
01:07:42,282 --> 01:07:44,315
I want you all
to start thinking about

1019
01:07:44,317 --> 01:07:46,617
our fifth grade
science fair projects.

1020
01:07:46,619 --> 01:07:50,487
Which you will need to work on to
have ready after spring break.

1021
01:07:50,489 --> 01:07:53,891
Okay? Now it could be
about anything.

1022
01:08:07,606 --> 01:08:11,508
The point is to create
something you're excited about.

1023
01:08:11,510 --> 01:08:13,346
Something you're proud
to show.

1024
01:08:13,847 --> 01:08:17,418
Mr. Will?

1025
01:08:18,717 --> 01:08:20,421
Something more important
to think about?

1026
01:08:20,753 --> 01:08:21,852
No.

1027
01:08:21,854 --> 01:08:24,022
So, it'll be teams of two.

1028
01:08:24,024 --> 01:08:26,360
Your partner
will be your tablemate.

1029
01:08:27,460 --> 01:08:29,059
Uh, Ms. Petosa?

1030
01:08:29,061 --> 01:08:30,695
I know we're supposed to be
in pairs,

1031
01:08:30,697 --> 01:08:33,464
but Jack, Amos and I had
this science fair project idea

1032
01:08:33,466 --> 01:08:34,932
that we wanted
to work on together.

1033
01:08:34,934 --> 01:08:36,000
Okay,
maybe we can switch.

1034
01:08:36,002 --> 01:08:37,238
Uh, no.

1035
01:08:37,604 --> 01:08:38,702
Sorry?

1036
01:08:38,704 --> 01:08:39,903
What?

1037
01:08:39,905 --> 01:08:43,911
No, um, it's okay.
I'll stay with who I've got.

1038
01:08:45,511 --> 01:08:47,280
I'll stick with Auggie.

1039
01:08:51,350 --> 01:08:53,750
Hey! What did you do that for?

1040
01:08:53,752 --> 01:08:55,452
Dude, I don't want to switch.

1041
01:08:55,454 --> 01:08:58,725
Why not? Do you really wanna
be partners with that freak?

1042
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:12,003
<i>Dear Mr. Tushman, I'm
very sorry for punching Julian.</i>

1043
01:09:12,005 --> 01:09:14,339
<i>It was wrong of me to do that.</i>

1044
01:09:14,341 --> 01:09:16,107
<i>I know you may need
to expel me,</i>

1045
01:09:16,109 --> 01:09:22,347
<i>but I'd still rather not say
why I did what I did.</i>

1046
01:09:22,349 --> 01:09:24,615
<i>It might get Julian
in trouble, too,</i>

1047
01:09:24,617 --> 01:09:26,851
- <i>and that's not fair.</i>
- Stop!

1048
01:09:26,853 --> 01:09:30,687
<i>Sincerely, Jack Will.</i>

1049
01:09:30,689 --> 01:09:37,061
<i>Dear Mr. Will, one thing
I've learned in 20 years in education</i>

1050
01:09:37,063 --> 01:09:40,598
<i>is that there are two sides
to every story.</i>

1051
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:45,669
<i>So I think I can imagine
what started the fight.</i>

1052
01:09:45,671 --> 01:09:48,841
<i>While nothing justifies
striking another student</i>

1053
01:09:50,009 --> 01:09:52,645
<i>I know good friends
are worth defending.</i>

1054
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:57,781
<i>So, after your
2-day suspension</i>

1055
01:09:57,783 --> 01:10:00,353
<i>your scholarship
will be waiting for you.</i>

1056
01:10:01,688 --> 01:10:03,420
<i>Just keep up the good work.</i>

1057
01:10:03,422 --> 01:10:05,992
<i>And keep being the fine boy
we all know you to be.</i>

1058
01:10:06,893 --> 01:10:09,962
<i>Sincerely, Mr. Tushman.</i>

1059
01:10:14,868 --> 01:10:17,735
What's so wrong with me not
telling you about a stupid play?

1060
01:10:17,737 --> 01:10:19,603
I'm not even in it.
I'm just doing the lights.

1061
01:10:19,605 --> 01:10:20,604
Well your boyfriend is in it.

1062
01:10:20,606 --> 01:10:22,773
And don't you think
we would like to see him?

1063
01:10:22,775 --> 01:10:23,674
No, I don't!

1064
01:10:23,676 --> 01:10:25,410
Look, let's all calm down
for a second.

1065
01:10:25,412 --> 01:10:26,910
You know,
you've been really good

1066
01:10:26,912 --> 01:10:29,013
at leaving me alone
my whole life.

1067
01:10:29,015 --> 01:10:31,148
So why are you suddenly
so interested, huh?

1068
01:10:31,150 --> 01:10:33,817
Are you bored now
that Auggie's in school?

1069
01:10:33,819 --> 01:10:35,686
Your thesis not going well?

1070
01:10:35,688 --> 01:10:37,487
Nate, could you please
excuse us?

1071
01:10:37,489 --> 01:10:38,759
- Izzy, she doesn't mean it.
- Nate!

1072
01:10:46,032 --> 01:10:47,697
What are they saying
down there?

1073
01:10:47,699 --> 01:10:50,802
They, my friend,
are saying a lotta things.

1074
01:10:50,804 --> 01:10:52,903
None of which concern us.

1075
01:10:52,905 --> 01:10:55,173
Let's see
your new <i>Minecraft</i> world.

1076
01:10:55,175 --> 01:10:57,478
'Cause we might
be moving to it.

1077
01:11:08,587 --> 01:11:11,824
So, are we going
to see the play?

1078
01:11:12,692 --> 01:11:13,857
Um...

1079
01:11:13,859 --> 01:11:16,928
I hadn't realized
what the play was

1080
01:11:16,930 --> 01:11:20,798
and I don't think it will be of
any interest to a kid your age.

1081
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:23,537
Yeah, uh,
you'd get totally bored.

1082
01:11:24,871 --> 01:11:26,603
Are you and Dad going?

1083
01:11:26,605 --> 01:11:29,639
Daddy'll go. And I'm gonna
stay here with you.

1084
01:11:29,641 --> 01:11:31,476
What?

1085
01:11:31,478 --> 01:11:33,977
So now you're gonna punish me
by not going?

1086
01:11:33,979 --> 01:11:36,848
Well, you didn't want me to go
in the first place, remember?

1087
01:11:36,850 --> 01:11:39,620
Well, now that you know about it,
of course, I want you to come.

1088
01:11:40,653 --> 01:11:41,986
What are you talking about?

1089
01:11:41,988 --> 01:11:42,990
Nothing.

1090
01:11:47,226 --> 01:11:48,992
You're lying.

1091
01:11:48,994 --> 01:11:51,562
It's just something to do
with Via's school, honey.

1092
01:11:51,564 --> 01:11:53,830
You just don't want your
fancy high school friends

1093
01:11:53,832 --> 01:11:55,165
to know your brother's
a freak, huh?

1094
01:11:55,167 --> 01:11:57,101
- Auggie!
- Auggie, that's not true.

1095
01:11:57,103 --> 01:12:00,073
Stop lying to me, I'm not an
idiot, I know what's going on!

1096
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:11,585
Daisy girl?

1097
01:12:12,185 --> 01:12:14,684
Auggie. Come on.

1098
01:12:14,686 --> 01:12:15,785
It's okay,
I don't wanna go

1099
01:12:15,787 --> 01:12:17,821
to your stupid high school
anyway. I don't care.

1100
01:12:17,823 --> 01:12:21,058
Auggie, not everything
in the world is about you.

1101
01:12:22,228 --> 01:12:23,730
What's wrong?

1102
01:12:38,176 --> 01:12:39,876
You're gonna be fine, girlie.

1103
01:12:39,878 --> 01:12:42,178
Daddy's gonna meet me there.
Take care of your brother.

1104
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:43,246
Yeah.

1105
01:12:43,248 --> 01:12:46,052
Okay. All right.

1106
01:13:02,902 --> 01:13:05,602
Did Daisy really bite Mom?

1107
01:13:05,604 --> 01:13:10,107
Well, um, she was whimpering.

1108
01:13:10,109 --> 01:13:14,178
And then Mom tried to pick
her up and Daisy bit her.

1109
01:13:14,180 --> 01:13:16,517
Do you think
the vet can fix her?

1110
01:13:18,784 --> 01:13:21,087
She was in a lot of pain,
Auggie.

1111
01:13:22,988 --> 01:13:24,790
She's really old.

1112
01:13:29,194 --> 01:13:30,530
Auggie?

1113
01:13:32,164 --> 01:13:35,836
I want you to come
to my play. Okay?

1114
01:13:36,903 --> 01:13:38,005
Really?

1115
01:13:39,037 --> 01:13:40,172
Really.

1116
01:14:54,113 --> 01:14:58,885
<i>Every time I came home
from the hospital, Daisy was here.</i>

1117
01:15:02,154 --> 01:15:03,889
<i>She was a real friend.</i>

1118
01:15:05,925 --> 01:15:09,829
<i>And real friends
are hard to find.</i>

1119
01:16:58,104 --> 01:16:59,202
Excuse me.

1120
01:16:59,204 --> 01:17:02,141
Sorry. Thank you.

1121
01:17:05,978 --> 01:17:08,978
- This is perfect.
- Here we go. Good seats.

1122
01:17:08,980 --> 01:17:12,883
Here. See if you can find
Via's name in there, honey.

1123
01:17:12,885 --> 01:17:17,220
Glasses. Oh, no!
I think I forgot my glasses.

1124
01:17:17,222 --> 01:17:21,025
Auggie, you're missing a great
episode of <i>Hoarders,</i> right here.

1125
01:17:21,027 --> 01:17:22,895
Starring your mom's purse.

1126
01:17:26,832 --> 01:17:27,932
You ready?

1127
01:17:27,934 --> 01:17:30,099
Are you supposed to be
in the girls' dressing room?

1128
01:17:30,101 --> 01:17:31,936
Just wanted to wish you
good luck.

1129
01:17:31,938 --> 01:17:33,507
"Break a leg",
not "Good luck."

1130
01:17:34,105 --> 01:17:35,108
You, too.

1131
01:17:36,242 --> 01:17:38,043
Anyone cheering
you on tonight?

1132
01:17:39,212 --> 01:17:43,112
Uh, yeah, my mom invited

1133
01:17:43,114 --> 01:17:44,949
the entire block.

1134
01:17:44,951 --> 01:17:46,482
It's gonna be
really embarrassing.

1135
01:17:46,484 --> 01:17:49,385
You?

1136
01:17:49,387 --> 01:17:52,589
Uh, my dad is
on his belated honeymoon.

1137
01:17:52,591 --> 01:17:54,191
And my mom's in a funk.

1138
01:17:54,193 --> 01:17:56,329
But maybe
she'll come tomorrow.

1139
01:17:59,064 --> 01:18:02,134
Well, um, Via's family
will cheer you on.

1140
01:18:03,970 --> 01:18:05,204
You'll be great tonight.

1141
01:18:16,181 --> 01:18:18,949
Honey, just enjoy the play.

1142
01:18:18,951 --> 01:18:19,953
Okay.

1143
01:18:23,389 --> 01:18:24,391
All right, go get 'em.

1144
01:18:26,057 --> 01:18:27,124
- Mr. Davenport...
- Hmm.

1145
01:18:27,126 --> 01:18:29,360
I'm really sorry,
but I can't go on tonight.

1146
01:18:29,362 --> 01:18:31,160
I don't feel well.
I think I might throw up.

1147
01:18:31,162 --> 01:18:32,463
Okay, everybody gets nervous.

1148
01:18:32,465 --> 01:18:33,531
You know,
when I did my Hamlet,

1149
01:18:33,533 --> 01:18:35,398
I threw up every night.
You're gonna be fine.

1150
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:37,367
Just do it. You'll have all
of spring break to recover.

1151
01:18:37,369 --> 01:18:39,872
Mr. Davenport, you're not
listening. I'm not going on.

1152
01:18:44,010 --> 01:18:45,675
Are you kidding me?

1153
01:18:45,677 --> 01:18:48,849
I'm really sorry, but Via knows
all the lines. She can do it.

1154
01:18:50,416 --> 01:18:51,985
Then go find her then.

1155
01:18:53,152 --> 01:18:54,154
Thank you.

1156
01:18:57,555 --> 01:19:00,057
Hi.

1157
01:19:10,302 --> 01:19:13,137
This play is called <i>Our Town.</i>

1158
01:19:13,139 --> 01:19:16,240
It was written
by Thornton Wilder.

1159
01:19:16,242 --> 01:19:21,477
The name of our town is Grover's
Corners, New Hampshire.

1160
01:19:21,479 --> 01:19:23,947
Just across
the Massachusetts line.

1161
01:19:23,949 --> 01:19:25,349
Is this...
Is this really happening?

1162
01:19:25,351 --> 01:19:27,651
Yes, you're going on as Emily.
Only you don't have much time.

1163
01:19:27,653 --> 01:19:30,353
Well, I don't even know if I'm
gonna remember all of my lines.

1164
01:19:30,355 --> 01:19:32,156
You'll be great.
Justin'll help you through it.

1165
01:19:32,158 --> 01:19:33,958
Where is she?

1166
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:35,692
Via, you're on in two minutes.

1167
01:19:35,694 --> 01:19:37,428
Why, why are you doing this?

1168
01:19:37,430 --> 01:19:41,264
I told you. I feel sick.

1169
01:19:41,266 --> 01:19:46,169
We've got a factory
in our town, too. You hear it?

1170
01:19:46,171 --> 01:19:49,238
Hey, it's okay.
Hey, break a leg.

1171
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:52,244
Makes blankets. Cartwrights
own it and it brung 'em a fortune.

1172
01:19:57,115 --> 01:19:59,083
Children,
now I won't have it.

1173
01:19:59,085 --> 01:20:01,285
Breakfast is just as good
as any other meal.

1174
01:20:01,287 --> 01:20:03,454
And I won't have you
gobbling like wolves.

1175
01:20:03,456 --> 01:20:05,421
It'll stunt your growth.
That's a fact.

1176
01:20:05,423 --> 01:20:07,558
Miranda looks so different.

1177
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:10,160
That's not Miranda,
it's Via.

1178
01:20:10,162 --> 01:20:12,265
- What?
- It's Via.

1179
01:20:13,164 --> 01:20:15,566
Oh, great.

1180
01:20:15,568 --> 01:20:19,335
As for me, I'd rather have
my children healthy than bright.

1181
01:20:19,337 --> 01:20:22,705
I'm both, Mama, you know I am.

1182
01:20:22,707 --> 01:20:25,075
I'm the brightest girl
in school for my age.

1183
01:20:25,077 --> 01:20:27,076
I have a wonderful memory.

1184
01:20:27,078 --> 01:20:28,648
Eat your breakfast.

1185
01:20:36,389 --> 01:20:39,259
Hmm. Your stomach flu
got better fast.

1186
01:20:40,059 --> 01:20:41,759
Sorry, sir, just jitters.

1187
01:20:41,761 --> 01:20:44,128
I'll be ready
by tomorrow night.

1188
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:45,998
She's doing very well.

1189
01:20:52,270 --> 01:20:55,675
I can't. I can't go on.

1190
01:20:59,712 --> 01:21:02,079
It goes so fast.

1191
01:21:02,081 --> 01:21:04,150
We don't even have time
to look at one another.

1192
01:21:05,551 --> 01:21:07,317
I didn't realize.

1193
01:21:07,319 --> 01:21:09,723
So all that was going on
and we never noticed?

1194
01:21:12,792 --> 01:21:17,364
Take me back. Up the hill.
To my grave.

1195
01:21:18,663 --> 01:21:24,003
But first, wait,
one more look.

1196
01:21:26,704 --> 01:21:30,309
Goodbye. Goodbye, world.

1197
01:21:32,711 --> 01:21:35,115
Goodbye, Grover's Corners.

1198
01:21:36,247 --> 01:21:37,250
Mama.

1199
01:21:38,350 --> 01:21:39,719
And Papa.

1200
01:21:41,087 --> 01:21:43,089
Goodbye to clocks ticking.

1201
01:21:45,390 --> 01:21:49,428
And food. And coffee.

1202
01:21:51,096 --> 01:21:55,067
And hot baths. And sleeping.

1203
01:21:57,103 --> 01:21:58,671
And waking up.

1204
01:22:03,609 --> 01:22:04,778
Oh, Earth...

1205
01:22:06,712 --> 01:22:09,682
You're too wonderful
for anybody to realize you.

1206
01:22:15,654 --> 01:22:18,455
Blow out the candles.
Ready? Take a big breath.

1207
01:22:21,493 --> 01:22:24,894
Ha! We did it.
Did you make a wish?

1208
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:26,863
I wished for a brother.

1209
01:22:26,865 --> 01:22:28,435
You did?

1210
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:31,634
Mmm. Wow.

1211
01:22:31,636 --> 01:22:33,773
Happy birthday, honey.

1212
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:03,735
Whoo!

1213
01:23:20,485 --> 01:23:21,652
Via!

1214
01:23:21,654 --> 01:23:22,822
Oh, my God!

1215
01:23:23,622 --> 01:23:25,254
That was incredible!

1216
01:23:25,256 --> 01:23:26,889
- It was just a play.
- It wasn't "just" anything.

1217
01:23:26,891 --> 01:23:28,458
- You were amazing!
- You were great, Via!

1218
01:23:28,460 --> 01:23:29,625
Amazing!

1219
01:23:29,627 --> 01:23:30,729
Oh, Auggie.

1220
01:23:54,319 --> 01:23:55,652
<i>And then
there was the nurse...</i>

1221
01:23:55,654 --> 01:23:57,086
<i>Yeah.</i>

1222
01:23:57,088 --> 01:24:00,257
...who farted, and I don't use
that word a lot, about 100 times.

1223
01:24:00,259 --> 01:24:02,358
Honey, that was you.

1224
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:04,260
To put it delicately.

1225
01:24:04,262 --> 01:24:05,861
I don't know
how else to say it.

1226
01:24:05,863 --> 01:24:06,929
It's not true.

1227
01:24:06,931 --> 01:24:08,932
- Busted now!
- No, it's not...

1228
01:24:08,934 --> 01:24:10,267
Anyone? Raise your hand

1229
01:24:10,269 --> 01:24:12,768
if you wanna change the subject
and save us from this story.

1230
01:24:12,770 --> 01:24:16,339
All right, I will. I will.
Um, what is that?

1231
01:24:16,341 --> 01:24:20,509
Oh that is Jack and Auggie's
science fair project.

1232
01:24:20,511 --> 01:24:22,379
Not to be confused
with an eyesore

1233
01:24:22,381 --> 01:24:23,981
in the middle of the room.

1234
01:24:23,983 --> 01:24:25,648
No, but what is it?

1235
01:24:25,650 --> 01:24:28,619
Well, I don't know.
I guess it's like a... Yeah.

1236
01:24:28,621 --> 01:24:29,785
Follow me, you'll see.

1237
01:24:29,787 --> 01:24:30,954
Oh, okay.

1238
01:24:30,956 --> 01:24:32,321
Come on!

1239
01:24:32,323 --> 01:24:33,690
All right.

1240
01:24:33,692 --> 01:24:35,692
- Sweet.
- What?

1241
01:24:35,694 --> 01:24:39,428
Are you kidding me? I cannot
believe you just did that.

1242
01:24:39,430 --> 01:24:42,266
Go, go, go. Okay.
But just no kissing.

1243
01:24:42,268 --> 01:24:45,369
Seen a lotta horror movies
end this way.

1244
01:24:45,371 --> 01:24:48,875
We're gonna open
the apertures in 3, 2, 1.

1245
01:24:53,578 --> 01:24:56,580
It's a camera obscura.

1246
01:24:56,582 --> 01:24:58,685
Yeah. He's ten.

1247
01:25:00,886 --> 01:25:02,753
Oh, my God, that was so cool.

1248
01:25:02,755 --> 01:25:04,955
Cinema history come to life.

1249
01:25:04,957 --> 01:25:07,723
All right, people,
single file.

1250
01:25:07,725 --> 01:25:11,027
Step right up for an amazing
camera obscura.

1251
01:25:11,029 --> 01:25:14,764
Step right up to witness Earth's
greatest mystery, the volcano.

1252
01:25:14,766 --> 01:25:17,567
Okay, we're gonna open
the apertures in...

1253
01:25:17,569 --> 01:25:19,839
3, 2,1!

1254
01:25:21,073 --> 01:25:23,674
- Whoa!
- That's awesome!

1255
01:25:32,685 --> 01:25:34,454
Jack and Auggie.

1256
01:25:38,823 --> 01:25:42,491
Dude!

1257
01:25:42,493 --> 01:25:44,363
- See, you have to go...
- No, I did.

1258
01:26:08,787 --> 01:26:09,986
Okay, now I'll go.

1259
01:26:26,971 --> 01:26:29,138
Let's go, let's go.

1260
01:26:29,140 --> 01:26:30,507
Everybody get in here.

1261
01:26:30,509 --> 01:26:32,442
Find your seats.

1262
01:26:32,444 --> 01:26:35,544
We good today? It's gonna be
a good one, guys.

1263
01:26:35,546 --> 01:26:38,615
All right. Everybody inside.

1264
01:26:38,617 --> 01:26:40,584
Come on.
New month, new precept.

1265
01:26:40,586 --> 01:26:42,785
Look at him.

1266
01:26:42,787 --> 01:26:44,521
Hey, where's Auggie?

1267
01:26:44,523 --> 01:26:45,591
Right there.

1268
01:26:47,592 --> 01:26:50,962
Hey, hey, hey. Why are we
running in the hallway?

1269
01:26:58,703 --> 01:26:59,736
Auggie, you okay?

1270
01:26:59,738 --> 01:27:04,473
Yeah. Everything's fine.
I'm late for class.

1271
01:27:04,475 --> 01:27:06,175
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

1272
01:27:06,177 --> 01:27:08,644
Auggie, you know if you need
help you can ask for it.

1273
01:27:08,646 --> 01:27:09,946
You're not alone.

1274
01:27:09,948 --> 01:27:11,050
I know.

1275
01:27:18,457 --> 01:27:19,559
Amos.

1276
01:27:22,661 --> 01:27:24,529
You know something about this?

1277
01:27:30,435 --> 01:27:32,134
You understand?

1278
01:27:32,136 --> 01:27:36,007
We take bullying
very seriously at this school.

1279
01:27:36,908 --> 01:27:38,443
There is zero tolerance.

1280
01:27:39,978 --> 01:27:44,147
Excuse me, can you explain
what's going on here?

1281
01:27:44,149 --> 01:27:46,549
Wasn't Julian the one
who got punched in the mouth?

1282
01:27:46,551 --> 01:27:48,987
If there's any bullying
going on, it isn't my son.

1283
01:28:00,064 --> 01:28:01,433
You wrote that, Julian?

1284
01:28:02,201 --> 01:28:03,700
Yes, sir.

1285
01:28:03,702 --> 01:28:06,939
That one note was on the back
of a class photo.

1286
01:28:08,506 --> 01:28:10,742
Your son photoshopped
Auggie out of it.

1287
01:28:14,179 --> 01:28:18,915
No. No, he didn't. I did.

1288
01:28:18,917 --> 01:28:21,550
Of course, I didn't think that
he would bring it to school.

1289
01:28:21,552 --> 01:28:23,219
But when our friends come over
and they see that picture,

1290
01:28:23,221 --> 01:28:24,720
I want them
to ask about our son.

1291
01:28:24,722 --> 01:28:26,790
Not the Pullmans'.

1292
01:28:26,792 --> 01:28:29,192
Mrs. Albans.

1293
01:28:29,194 --> 01:28:34,263
When we pressed Auggie,
he showed us these other notes

1294
01:28:34,265 --> 01:28:38,437
that your son left
in his locker and his desk.

1295
01:28:41,038 --> 01:28:42,140
Chair.

1296
01:28:47,779 --> 01:28:48,844
Okay, look,
if no one else is gonna

1297
01:28:48,846 --> 01:28:52,081
have the courage to say it,
then I guess I will.

1298
01:28:52,083 --> 01:28:54,918
These kids are too young to be
dealing with this sort of thing.

1299
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:56,919
Julian has had nightmares
because of that kid.

1300
01:28:56,921 --> 01:28:58,287
- Did you know that?
- Sarah.

1301
01:28:58,289 --> 01:29:00,656
We had to take him
to a child psychologist

1302
01:29:00,658 --> 01:29:02,192
to help him deal
with his night terrors.

1303
01:29:02,194 --> 01:29:03,996
It's just
a two-day suspension.

1304
01:29:05,796 --> 01:29:07,263
You'll stay home
from the nature preserve trip.

1305
01:29:07,265 --> 01:29:08,798
That's all.

1306
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:13,303
Two days for a couple of notes
from a kid?

1307
01:29:13,305 --> 01:29:16,238
After all the money that we
have poured into this school?

1308
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:18,842
We have a lot of friends on
the school board, Mr. Tushman.

1309
01:29:18,844 --> 01:29:20,078
Oh.

1310
01:29:21,078 --> 01:29:23,713
Well, I have more.

1311
01:29:23,715 --> 01:29:24,947
So what would you
have us do?

1312
01:29:24,949 --> 01:29:27,552
Bend over backwards for every
single person in the world?

1313
01:29:28,953 --> 01:29:31,321
Nobody can get
their feelings hurt ever?

1314
01:29:31,323 --> 01:29:34,691
You are not doing
these kids any favors.

1315
01:29:34,693 --> 01:29:38,564
Mrs. Albans, Auggie
can't change the way he looks.

1316
01:29:40,798 --> 01:29:43,903
So, maybe we can change
the way we see.

1317
01:29:49,942 --> 01:29:50,974
Yes.

1318
01:29:50,976 --> 01:29:54,878
I will be sure to tell that
to the real world.

1319
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:58,951
Thank you for this.
We won't be back in the fall.

1320
01:30:01,086 --> 01:30:05,054
Mom. I like this school.

1321
01:30:05,056 --> 01:30:08,258
Mom. I have friends, Dad.

1322
01:30:08,260 --> 01:30:09,595
Let's go, Julian.

1323
01:30:10,796 --> 01:30:11,797
Come on.

1324
01:30:18,970 --> 01:30:20,138
Mr. Tushman.

1325
01:30:23,774 --> 01:30:25,110
I'm really sorry.

1326
01:30:27,813 --> 01:30:29,548
I know you are, Julian.

1327
01:30:45,396 --> 01:30:48,167
- He's not even looking at us.
- Oh.

1328
01:31:17,095 --> 01:31:19,294
This is gonna be epic.
Race ya!

1329
01:32:17,722 --> 01:32:20,693
- The sound of joy!
- Ah...

1330
01:32:25,329 --> 01:32:27,830
All right. I want you
to close your eyes,

1331
01:32:27,832 --> 01:32:30,232
because I have
a surprise for you.

1332
01:32:30,234 --> 01:32:33,402
Do you take requests?

1333
01:32:33,404 --> 01:32:35,807
Not before 9:45.

1334
01:32:36,774 --> 01:32:37,777
Okay.

1335
01:32:38,944 --> 01:32:40,246
Open your eyes.

1336
01:32:42,346 --> 01:32:45,080
No! Are you...
You finished your thesis!

1337
01:32:45,082 --> 01:32:46,915
Let's get drunk.

1338
01:32:46,917 --> 01:32:49,054
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

1339
01:32:50,488 --> 01:32:54,059
Wait a minute.
A double surprise, surprise.

1340
01:32:55,060 --> 01:32:56,125
Okay.

1341
01:32:56,127 --> 01:32:58,093
- Go ahead.
- Nothin's gonna

1342
01:32:58,095 --> 01:32:59,431
- jump out at me, is it?
- No.

1343
01:33:00,865 --> 01:33:02,264
Givin' me the eyes.

1344
01:33:02,266 --> 01:33:04,867
What's in here?
I'm kind of scared...

1345
01:33:07,538 --> 01:33:09,472
Good, right?

1346
01:33:09,474 --> 01:33:11,875
I'm just gonna keep that
in the box for now.

1347
01:33:11,877 --> 01:33:14,814
Does that merit a kiss?
Come here.

1348
01:33:15,947 --> 01:33:17,016
More than a kiss.

1349
01:33:17,515 --> 01:33:19,148
Thank you.

1350
01:33:19,150 --> 01:33:24,521
Alright, kids! Let's give a big warm
welcome to the William Heath School!

1351
01:33:24,523 --> 01:33:28,191
The Glover Academy!
And Beecher Prep!

1352
01:33:28,193 --> 01:33:29,925
Last chance to get popcorn!

1353
01:33:29,927 --> 01:33:31,027
Hello.

1354
01:33:31,029 --> 01:33:32,394
Okay!

1355
01:33:32,396 --> 01:33:35,932
Welcome to the 23rd annual

1356
01:33:35,934 --> 01:33:40,102
Big Movie Saturday in the
Broarwood Nature Reserve!

1357
01:33:41,405 --> 01:33:42,507
Whoo!

1358
01:33:43,841 --> 01:33:45,541
Tonight's movie will be...

1359
01:33:45,543 --> 01:33:47,343
<i>The Wizard of Oz!</i>

1360
01:33:47,345 --> 01:33:49,181
Yay!

1361
01:33:51,550 --> 01:33:53,883
Hey, dude.
You wanna go outside?

1362
01:33:53,885 --> 01:33:54,951
Why?

1363
01:33:54,953 --> 01:33:57,219
We can watch this movie
any time.

1364
01:34:14,104 --> 01:34:16,438
Aw, man, I need to pee.

1365
01:34:16,440 --> 01:34:18,141
Wanna go back?

1366
01:34:18,143 --> 01:34:19,942
Nah, I'll just go over here.

1367
01:34:19,944 --> 01:34:22,245
Like in the subways?
That's gross.

1368
01:34:22,247 --> 01:34:24,513
No. This is gross.

1369
01:34:33,891 --> 01:34:35,157
Look at that.

1370
01:34:35,159 --> 01:34:37,429
What? What are you lookin' at?

1371
01:34:39,363 --> 01:34:42,065
I'm going up there someday.

1372
01:34:42,067 --> 01:34:44,634
Well, I'm going down here
right now, so...

1373
01:34:44,636 --> 01:34:46,402
I gotta go, too, now.

1374
01:34:46,404 --> 01:34:49,906
You go there. I'll go here.
Don't look.

1375
01:34:51,342 --> 01:34:52,976
What do we got here?

1376
01:34:52,978 --> 01:34:55,146
Couple of losers stinkin' up
the woods.

1377
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:59,982
Holy crap! Look at his face!

1378
01:34:59,984 --> 01:35:01,285
He's a freak!

1379
01:35:01,287 --> 01:35:03,553
Jesus, I've never seen
anything that ugly in my life.

1380
01:35:03,555 --> 01:35:04,653
Maybe it's an orc.

1381
01:35:04,655 --> 01:35:06,289
- Dude, let's go.
- Go where?

1382
01:35:06,291 --> 01:35:07,956
Hey, talkin' to you, Gollum.

1383
01:35:07,958 --> 01:35:10,863
This the one mask to rule
them all? My precious.

1384
01:35:11,462 --> 01:35:12,831
Hey, what's your problem?

1385
01:35:17,269 --> 01:35:18,567
Your boyfriend's
my problem.

1386
01:35:18,569 --> 01:35:20,602
Hey! Leave him alone.

1387
01:35:20,604 --> 01:35:22,974
What are you
gonna do about it?

1388
01:35:23,675 --> 01:35:25,575
- Get outta my way.
- No.

1389
01:35:25,577 --> 01:35:27,376
I said
get outta my way!

1390
01:35:27,378 --> 01:35:29,678
I said no!

1391
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:31,947
Yo, Jack,
what's up, man?

1392
01:35:31,949 --> 01:35:33,282
What's this?
More little freaks?

1393
01:35:33,284 --> 01:35:34,683
What you call us, hick?

1394
01:35:34,685 --> 01:35:35,887
Come on, prep boy.

1395
01:35:39,123 --> 01:35:40,158
Guys, stop!

1396
01:35:42,359 --> 01:35:43,461
Guys, stop it!

1397
01:35:45,195 --> 01:35:46,329
Guys, stop!

1398
01:35:46,331 --> 01:35:49,065
Just stop, please! Stop!

1399
01:35:49,067 --> 01:35:51,170
Just go!

1400
01:35:55,472 --> 01:35:59,174
Oh, man! Dude!
Come on! Let's go!

1401
01:35:59,176 --> 01:36:00,378
Let's get out!

1402
01:36:09,287 --> 01:36:11,254
- Are you okay?
- Uh...

1403
01:36:11,256 --> 01:36:12,955
Dude, you're bleeding.

1404
01:36:14,426 --> 01:36:16,362
What was that?
Something's coming.

1405
01:36:17,962 --> 01:36:19,195
Amos?

1406
01:36:19,197 --> 01:36:20,362
Jack!

1407
01:36:20,364 --> 01:36:22,233
- Over here!
- Amos, come on!

1408
01:36:24,636 --> 01:36:26,268
They follow you?

1409
01:36:26,270 --> 01:36:27,605
I think we lost 'em.

1410
01:36:28,405 --> 01:36:29,973
Whoa!

1411
01:36:33,610 --> 01:36:36,079
How did you guys
know we needed help?

1412
01:36:36,081 --> 01:36:37,580
We saw them follow you
out of the lodge.

1413
01:36:37,582 --> 01:36:40,983
I think they were seventh
graders. They were huge.

1414
01:36:40,985 --> 01:36:43,553
Thanks, guys.

1415
01:36:43,555 --> 01:36:45,487
You totally saved our butts.

1416
01:36:45,489 --> 01:36:47,458
Yeah, thanks, guys.

1417
01:36:50,295 --> 01:36:53,666
You know, it was cool how you
stood your ground, little dude.

1418
01:38:17,849 --> 01:38:19,816
Hi!

1419
01:38:19,818 --> 01:38:22,785
Oh, my gosh,
I missed you so much! Mmm.

1420
01:38:22,787 --> 01:38:24,853
- See you later, Auggie!
- Bye!

1421
01:38:24,855 --> 01:38:25,789
How are you?

1422
01:38:25,791 --> 01:38:27,857
Good. And guess what?
I got in a fight.

1423
01:38:27,859 --> 01:38:30,593
Oh my God,
you're bleeding! Are you okay?

1424
01:38:30,595 --> 01:38:31,693
What happened?

1425
01:38:31,695 --> 01:38:33,198
Auggie got in a fight.

1426
01:38:34,599 --> 01:38:36,398
That's terrible.
I'm sorry.

1427
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:38,668
- Did you win?
- Nate!

1428
01:38:38,670 --> 01:38:41,440
Well, I'm getting a vibe
like maybe he won.

1429
01:38:42,340 --> 01:38:43,406
Did you?

1430
01:38:43,408 --> 01:38:46,875
Yeah. And guess what?
They were seventh graders.

1431
01:38:46,877 --> 01:38:48,878
Yes!

1432
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:50,412
See you later, buddy!

1433
01:38:50,414 --> 01:38:51,417
Bye!

1434
01:38:53,251 --> 01:38:54,884
Fighting is bad, Auggie.

1435
01:38:54,886 --> 01:38:57,419
- Bye, Mr. and Mrs. P.
- Goodbye.

1436
01:38:57,421 --> 01:38:59,257
See you at graduation, Auggie.

1437
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:05,760
Looking sharp.

1438
01:39:05,762 --> 01:39:06,896
Thanks, Dad.

1439
01:39:06,898 --> 01:39:08,430
I'm talking about me.

1440
01:39:08,432 --> 01:39:11,666
Hey! Ah, you look good, too.

1441
01:39:11,668 --> 01:39:16,407
I think it's safe to say the
Pullman men are crushing it today.

1442
01:39:19,511 --> 01:39:22,448
- You've come a long way, huh?
- Yeah.

1443
01:39:25,550 --> 01:39:29,218
Auggie, I am proud of you
for sticking it out.

1444
01:39:29,220 --> 01:39:30,753
You didn't think I would,
did you?

1445
01:39:30,755 --> 01:39:32,157
'Course I did.

1446
01:39:35,159 --> 01:39:36,192
Okay, well, come on.

1447
01:39:36,194 --> 01:39:38,660
I mean, when you started
you were still wearing

1448
01:39:38,662 --> 01:39:41,229
the astronaut helmet
in public.

1449
01:39:41,231 --> 01:39:44,470
I love that helmet.
I wish I knew where it was.

1450
01:39:47,905 --> 01:39:49,638
It's in my office.

1451
01:39:49,640 --> 01:39:53,442
What? Dad! That was a gift.
You had no right to hide it!

1452
01:39:53,444 --> 01:39:55,343
Auggie, Auggie,
please, don't be mad.

1453
01:39:55,345 --> 01:39:58,748
You gotta understand, you
were wearing it all the time.

1454
01:39:58,750 --> 01:40:00,549
I never got
to see you anymore.

1455
01:40:00,551 --> 01:40:02,785
I missed your face.

1456
01:40:02,787 --> 01:40:05,588
I know you don't always
like it, but I love it.

1457
01:40:05,590 --> 01:40:07,626
It's my son's face.

1458
01:40:10,627 --> 01:40:12,363
I wanna see it.

1459
01:40:15,332 --> 01:40:16,632
Do you forgive me?

1460
01:40:16,634 --> 01:40:17,636
No.

1461
01:40:20,637 --> 01:40:21,640
Yes.

1462
01:40:23,908 --> 01:40:25,308
Does Mom know?

1463
01:40:25,310 --> 01:40:28,210
No.
God, no, she'd kill me.

1464
01:40:28,212 --> 01:40:31,479
But I can maybe find it,
if you need it back.

1465
01:40:31,481 --> 01:40:32,751
That's okay.

1466
01:40:59,543 --> 01:41:01,544
- Mom.
- Yes?

1467
01:41:01,546 --> 01:41:02,681
Thank you.

1468
01:41:04,414 --> 01:41:05,513
For what?

1469
01:41:05,515 --> 01:41:07,318
Making me go to school.

1470
01:41:10,587 --> 01:41:12,787
I was so mad at you sometimes.

1471
01:41:12,789 --> 01:41:14,826
But I'm really happy
to be here.

1472
01:41:16,961 --> 01:41:19,463
You really are a wonder,
Auggie.

1473
01:41:20,731 --> 01:41:22,400
You are a wonder.

1474
01:41:42,953 --> 01:41:45,053
Whoo.

1475
01:41:45,055 --> 01:41:48,859
Thank you, choir.
That was beautiful.

1476
01:41:50,427 --> 01:41:56,268
Ladies, gentlemen,
boys and girls, graduates.

1477
01:41:57,734 --> 01:42:02,905
Final award this morning is
the Henry Ward Beecher medal

1478
01:42:02,907 --> 01:42:08,678
to honor students who have
been notable or exemplary.

1479
01:42:08,680 --> 01:42:14,683
Usually, it's a "good works,"
a service award.

1480
01:42:14,685 --> 01:42:18,019
But I came upon a passage
that he wrote,

1481
01:42:18,021 --> 01:42:24,429
which made me realize that
good works come in many forms.

1482
01:42:26,064 --> 01:42:31,802
"Greatness," he wrote,
"lies not in being strong

1483
01:42:32,837 --> 01:42:36,708
"but in the right using
of strength.

1484
01:42:37,742 --> 01:42:42,111
<i>"He or she is the greatest</i>

1485
01:42:42,113 --> 01:42:46,648
<i>"whose strength carries up
the most hearts</i>

1486
01:42:46,650 --> 01:42:49,854
<i>"by the attraction
of his own."</i>

1487
01:42:53,557 --> 01:42:59,995
Without further ado,
this year, I am very proud

1488
01:42:59,997 --> 01:43:04,633
to award the Henry Ward
Beecher medal

1489
01:43:04,635 --> 01:43:09,371
to the student
whose quiet strength

1490
01:43:09,373 --> 01:43:11,710
has carried up
the most hearts.

1491
01:43:12,643 --> 01:43:14,509
So,

1492
01:43:14,511 --> 01:43:18,446
will August Pullman please come
up here to receive this award?

1493
01:43:24,721 --> 01:43:26,023
Whoo!

1494
01:43:52,682 --> 01:43:54,886
You're the best, dude!

1495
01:43:58,890 --> 01:44:03,526
<i>Walking up towards that
stage, I felt like I was floating.</i>

1496
01:44:03,528 --> 01:44:06,128
<i>My heart was beating so fast.</i>

1497
01:44:06,130 --> 01:44:09,464
<i>I didn't really understand
why I was getting a medal.</i>

1498
01:44:09,466 --> 01:44:12,835
<i>It's not like I blew up
the Death Star.</i>

1499
01:44:12,837 --> 01:44:17,039
<i>All I did was get through fifth
grade, just like everyone else here.</i>

1500
01:44:17,041 --> 01:44:18,110
Congratulations.

1501
01:44:20,211 --> 01:44:22,644
Here you go. That's for you.

1502
01:44:22,646 --> 01:44:25,050
<i>Then again, maybe
that's kind of the point.</i>

1503
01:44:26,917 --> 01:44:30,454
<i>Maybe the truth is,
I'm really not so ordinary.</i>

1504
01:44:31,855 --> 01:44:34,656
<i>Maybe if we knew what other
people were thinking</i>

1505
01:44:34,658 --> 01:44:37,125
<i>we'd know that
no one's ordinary.</i>

1506
01:44:37,127 --> 01:44:41,899
<i>And we all deserve a standing
ovation at least once in our lives.</i>

1507
01:44:43,201 --> 01:44:44,735
<i>My friends do.</i>

1508
01:44:49,207 --> 01:44:50,809
<i>My teachers do.</i>

1509
01:44:52,042 --> 01:44:55,878
<i>My sister does
for always being there for me.</i>

1510
01:44:55,880 --> 01:44:58,784
<i>My dad does
for always making us laugh.</i>

1511
01:44:59,884 --> 01:45:01,951
<i>And my mom does the most.</i>

1512
01:45:01,953 --> 01:45:04,887
<i>For never giving up.
On anything.</i>

1513
01:45:04,889 --> 01:45:06,123
<i>Especially, me.</i>

1514
01:45:07,891 --> 01:45:12,027
<i>It's like that last precept
Mr. Browne gave us.</i>

1515
01:45:12,029 --> 01:45:16,499
<i>Be kind, for everyone
is fighting a hard battle.</i>

1516
01:45:16,501 --> 01:45:18,804
<i>And if you really wanna see
what people are,</i>

1517
01:45:20,037 --> 01:45:24,141
<i>all you have to do... is look.</i>

1518
