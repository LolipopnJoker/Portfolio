1
00:00:30,379 --> 00:00:34,975
<i>Hey there, all you sleepy
Angelenos. A good, good morning to you.</i>

2
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:38,677
<i>It's your buddy, Romeo Midnight.
I know.</i>

3
00:00:38,854 --> 00:00:41,846
<i>I'm the voice you normally
listen to in the middle of the night.</i>

4
00:00:42,024 --> 00:00:47,553
<i>But today is special, Los Angeles.
It's my favorite day of the year.</i>

5
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:51,028
<i>Today is Valentine's Day.</i>

6
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:56,330
<i>And that's why I'll be here all day and
all night, playing the songs you love...</i>

7
00:00:56,505 --> 00:01:00,464
<i>...and the songs you love
to love to.</i>

8
00:02:46,681 --> 00:02:48,239
Hi.

9
00:02:48,917 --> 00:02:50,407
Okay.

10
00:02:51,553 --> 00:02:56,422
When I was a kid, most of the advice
that my dad gave me was crap.

11
00:02:57,726 --> 00:03:00,889
There's one thing that he said
that was pure genius.

12
00:03:02,164 --> 00:03:05,656
He said, "If you ever are with a girl...

13
00:03:07,135 --> 00:03:09,296
...that's too good for you...

14
00:03:10,338 --> 00:03:11,566
...marry her."

15
00:03:14,776 --> 00:03:16,368
So...

16
00:03:17,946 --> 00:03:19,379
Wow.

17
00:03:28,723 --> 00:03:32,215
- Really?
- Happy Valentine's Day.

18
00:03:32,394 --> 00:03:35,329
Happy Valentine's Day.

19
00:03:42,003 --> 00:03:43,436
She said yes!

20
00:03:55,884 --> 00:04:00,617
Julia, call me as soon as you get this.
I got big news. Big news.

21
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:03,280
- She said yes.
- You're kidding.

22
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,858
- What?
- I mean, you're kidding!

23
00:04:06,027 --> 00:04:08,655
- You thought she'd say no.
- Man, come on. You know me...

24
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,355
...always preparing for the worst.
Immigrant mentality.

25
00:04:11,533 --> 00:04:14,661
- Forget it. She said yes. This is good news.
- Yeah, and get this:

26
00:04:14,836 --> 00:04:20,274
I don't even have to play it cool today.
I can be a sappy cheeseball all day...

27
00:04:20,442 --> 00:04:24,242
...mooning about love to total strangers,
and no one'll think I'm a moron.

28
00:04:24,412 --> 00:04:27,142
Because it's Valentine's Day, huh?

29
00:04:27,315 --> 00:04:30,580
And everyone is romantic
on Valentine's Day.

30
00:04:32,521 --> 00:04:36,252
Get your head out of your ass
and use your damn turn signal...

31
00:04:36,424 --> 00:04:38,915
...you freaking moron.

32
00:04:40,896 --> 00:04:42,557
<i>Good morning, Los Angeles.</i>

33
00:04:42,731 --> 00:04:46,792
<i>I'm Sherry Donaldson
with the KVLA news team.</i>

34
00:04:46,968 --> 00:04:50,631
- And now let's check the weather.
- Good morning.

35
00:04:52,507 --> 00:04:56,068
Sun shines on late morning,
and look at these numbers.

36
00:04:56,244 --> 00:05:00,180
Highs in the upper valleys in the 60s,
and a bit cloudy by the coast...

37
00:05:00,348 --> 00:05:04,307
...until mid-morning,
when the marine layer burns off.

38
00:05:04,586 --> 00:05:06,554
Susan, what the hell is this?

39
00:05:06,721 --> 00:05:10,350
Oh, the boss thinks
it's gonna up the ratings.

40
00:05:10,525 --> 00:05:12,686
And we're clear.

41
00:05:12,861 --> 00:05:15,659
Not talking about Pippi Longstocking,
I'm talking about this.

42
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,196
I'm a sports journalist,
I don't do lifestyle.

43
00:05:18,366 --> 00:05:21,233
You're my number two sports journalist,
Kelvin, which means...

44
00:05:21,403 --> 00:05:24,804
...that on slow sports days,
you do the pieces I want you to do.

45
00:05:24,973 --> 00:05:27,339
The station wants more fluff.

46
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:30,740
I'll do some follow-up stories,
do some investigative reporting...

47
00:05:30,912 --> 00:05:32,004
...bring it back to you?

48
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,445
There's only one story today, Kelvin.
It's all yours.

49
00:05:35,617 --> 00:05:38,677
It's not complicated.
It's your basic man on the street.

50
00:05:39,187 --> 00:05:44,250
"Tell me, John Q, Jane Q,
what does Valentine's Day mean to you?"

51
00:05:44,426 --> 00:05:46,826
It gives me acid reflux.
That's what it means to me.

52
00:05:46,995 --> 00:05:50,055
We spend a lot of money. Nobody cares.
It's not a real holiday.

53
00:05:50,232 --> 00:05:52,132
We don't take the day off.
Come on, Susan.

54
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,498
And we're coming back
in five, four, three...

55
00:05:57,072 --> 00:05:59,404
Listen, I'm a player...

56
00:05:59,574 --> 00:06:02,475
...but I shut down my player-ness...

57
00:06:02,644 --> 00:06:06,375
...from New Year's to Saint Paddy's Day
just so I can avoid this day.

58
00:06:07,415 --> 00:06:11,249
I need happy, I need romantic,
I need love...

59
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:12,909
...and I need it from you.

60
00:06:13,622 --> 00:06:15,249
You need Jesus.

61
00:06:16,424 --> 00:06:18,984
Go. Go away now.

62
00:06:32,307 --> 00:06:34,935
Sunflowers! Beautiful!

63
00:06:59,467 --> 00:07:01,526
Good morning!

64
00:07:04,873 --> 00:07:06,807
- Hello, good morning.
- Hello, hello.

65
00:07:06,975 --> 00:07:09,637
I need my lucky bamboo.
Actually, I need both flats, and...

66
00:07:09,811 --> 00:07:12,712
- Do you hav...? I actually need the whole lot.
- All of them?

67
00:07:12,881 --> 00:07:15,577
- Want my Gerbera daisies too?
- No, no, no. No... Yes.

68
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,809
Alphonso's gonna
pick everything up later.

69
00:07:17,986 --> 00:07:21,353
- Mr. Reed, why are you always happy?
- Why not be always happy?

70
00:07:23,425 --> 00:07:24,653
- Reed?
- Simon.

71
00:07:24,826 --> 00:07:26,157
- Reed.
- What's up, man?

72
00:07:26,328 --> 00:07:27,420
- How are you?
- All right.

73
00:07:27,595 --> 00:07:30,223
- What's going on?
- Hey, I'm gonna be on TV.

74
00:07:30,398 --> 00:07:32,423
- Interviewer over there.
- Really?

75
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,262
Nice! Listen, I need to talk to you.

76
00:07:35,437 --> 00:07:36,927
Morley said yes.

77
00:07:37,772 --> 00:07:38,932
She said yes?

78
00:07:39,107 --> 00:07:41,974
What is with everybody?
She said yes. I'm getting married.

79
00:07:42,143 --> 00:07:43,167
It's great news, huh?

80
00:07:45,246 --> 00:07:48,511
Listen, I need to get her something,
like, really nice, though, like...

81
00:07:48,683 --> 00:07:51,914
Not roses, something out of the ordinary,
you know?

82
00:07:52,087 --> 00:07:53,520
Ah... Huh.

83
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:57,718
- Wow, what is it?
- No, no, no.

84
00:07:57,892 --> 00:08:01,760
Do not open until perfect moment.

85
00:08:01,963 --> 00:08:04,363
Ready for the interview.

86
00:08:05,033 --> 00:08:07,467
Kelvin Moore here, KVLA Channel 13...

87
00:08:07,635 --> 00:08:11,935
...right here at the downtown
flower mart with Mr. Simon Pham...

88
00:08:12,107 --> 00:08:13,938
...that's P-H-A-M, not with an F.

89
00:08:14,109 --> 00:08:18,068
Mr. Pham, how many red roses do you sell
on Valentine's Day?

90
00:08:18,246 --> 00:08:20,874
The Captain and Tennille
were married on Valentine's Day.

91
00:08:21,049 --> 00:08:22,073
What's that you said?

92
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,878
The Captain and Tennille were married
on Valentine's Day.

93
00:08:25,053 --> 00:08:29,149
A hundred and ten million red roses
are sold in America every Valentine's Day.

94
00:08:29,324 --> 00:08:33,351
- Sixty percent are produced in California.
- Does he work for you? I mean...

95
00:08:33,528 --> 00:08:34,552
I'm a florist.

96
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:37,960
I own Siena Bouquet, 2173 Rosewood.

97
00:08:38,133 --> 00:08:40,033
- And what's your name, sir?
- Reed Bennett.

98
00:08:40,201 --> 00:08:43,830
- Hi. How are you? Sports guy. Sports.
- Reed Bennett. Yeah, sports.

99
00:08:44,005 --> 00:08:46,200
- Okay, from Santa Montica...
- Siena Bouquet.

100
00:08:46,374 --> 00:08:49,036
- Santa... What is it? Siena Bouquet.
- Siena Bouquet.

101
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,542
In the Val... Off of Ventura.

102
00:09:01,556 --> 00:09:04,252
Well, you do have a flaw after all.

103
00:09:04,426 --> 00:09:07,020
- Oh, yeah? What's that?
- Your job.

104
00:09:07,195 --> 00:09:08,594
I thought women liked doctors.

105
00:09:10,165 --> 00:09:14,693
We do like lab coats, but the flying
around everywhere is not so good.

106
00:09:14,869 --> 00:09:17,030
I'm only going to San Francisco
for one night.

107
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,201
Couldn't somebody else do it,
just tonight?

108
00:09:21,376 --> 00:09:22,536
No, I'm the best.

109
00:09:23,945 --> 00:09:27,847
If it's any consolation,
when I'm fixing his heart...

110
00:09:28,016 --> 00:09:30,746
...you can hold mine.

111
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:34,082
Oh. Thank you.

112
00:09:35,723 --> 00:09:40,092
Hey, what are you doing? No.
I can't miss my plane. No.

113
00:09:43,431 --> 00:09:46,298
I can't believe you're leaving me
on Valentine's Day.

114
00:09:46,468 --> 00:09:49,130
- You said you had something to do.
- I do have something.

115
00:09:49,304 --> 00:09:52,865
I do have something to do.
I just don't know that I wanna do it.

116
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,236
- You know my friend Kara?
- Which one's Kara?

117
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:56,900
Neurotic, hot mess.

118
00:09:57,078 --> 00:10:00,980
She throws this annual
"I Hate Valentine's Day" dinner.

119
00:10:01,549 --> 00:10:05,849
- It's a bit of a downer, actually.
- What's there to hate?

120
00:10:06,454 --> 00:10:09,548
Nothing, if you're a handsome,
divorced doctor.

121
00:10:09,724 --> 00:10:13,251
But for the rest of us single women,
it's kind of a giant cosmic bitch slap.

122
00:10:13,428 --> 00:10:16,226
It's the universe saying,
"Look, remember when you were 14...

123
00:10:16,397 --> 00:10:18,262
...and you had cystic acne and braces...

124
00:10:18,433 --> 00:10:20,526
...and you played the saxophone
in the band...

125
00:10:20,702 --> 00:10:23,227
...and no one would invite you
to the winter formal?

126
00:10:23,404 --> 00:10:24,632
Well, nothing's changed."

127
00:10:26,207 --> 00:10:29,574
I would crawl over cut glass
to take you to the winter formal.

128
00:10:29,744 --> 00:10:32,008
And then I would prescribe Retin-A
for your skin.

129
00:10:34,215 --> 00:10:36,706
That's why you're my valentine.

130
00:10:36,885 --> 00:10:38,716
<i>So we have a professional here.</i>

131
00:10:38,887 --> 00:10:41,355
<i>I'm sure you've heard a lot of stories
on Valentine's Day.</i>

132
00:10:41,523 --> 00:10:42,854
<i>Do you still believe in love?</i>

133
00:10:43,024 --> 00:10:47,085
<i>Hell, yes. Love is the only shocking act
left on the planet.</i>

134
00:10:47,262 --> 00:10:51,631
<i>Well, if he said it, folks,
it must be true, because he is a florist.</i>

135
00:11:06,381 --> 00:11:08,042
What is it?

136
00:11:08,216 --> 00:11:09,376
Oh, you're up.

137
00:11:10,051 --> 00:11:13,111
- Did you get my good side?
- I don't know. Roll over.

138
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,284
Last night...

139
00:11:22,597 --> 00:11:23,962
Was...?

140
00:11:24,132 --> 00:11:25,497
- Amazing.
- Okay, thank you.

141
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:29,569
- Wow. Well, I used to be a gymnast.
- Oh, well, that explains a lot.

142
00:11:29,737 --> 00:11:31,932
Yeah, I didn't hurt you, right?

143
00:11:32,473 --> 00:11:35,533
- You're so cute.
- I thought you wanted to be a poet...

144
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,406
...not a photographer.
- A girl can change her mind, Jason.

145
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,878
That's how last night happened.

146
00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:45,645
- Anyway, I could not write that photo.
- Okay, yeah. Um...

147
00:11:46,321 --> 00:11:49,085
Is my nose kind of...?
It looks kind of big for my face.

148
00:11:49,257 --> 00:11:52,715
I think that's L.A. Talking.
I think you have a great nose.

149
00:12:00,568 --> 00:12:01,899
Oh, my God. Is that the time?

150
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:05,870
What? What? No, it's 3 minutes fast.
I don't like being late.

151
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,634
- I have to go. I just...
- Just like that?

152
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:11,608
Yeah, I'm sorry. I just...
Skirt? Skirt, skirt, skirt.

153
00:12:13,014 --> 00:12:16,347
What? Oh, right.
I think I half-remember that.

154
00:12:16,517 --> 00:12:19,884
- Three minutes? Why not 5 minutes ahead?
- I don't wanna seem eager.

155
00:12:20,054 --> 00:12:21,749
But, yeah, you know what? Stay.

156
00:12:21,923 --> 00:12:24,915
Hang out for a little bit.
Maybe we can grab breakfast.

157
00:12:27,395 --> 00:12:31,957
- Oh, I knew it. I knew it.
- What is that, techno?

158
00:12:32,133 --> 00:12:33,327
- What?
- The ring.

159
00:12:33,501 --> 00:12:39,133
Oh, no, I think it's, like,
a little more retro. It's kind of '70s.

160
00:12:39,307 --> 00:12:42,640
Thank you so much for last night.
I had a blast.

161
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:45,074
And there is fresh coffee for you
in the kitchen.

162
00:12:45,246 --> 00:12:46,975
- I think I'm out of coffee.
- You were.

163
00:12:47,148 --> 00:12:49,708
I borrowed some from your neighbor.
She was surprised...

164
00:12:49,884 --> 00:12:52,318
...you had female company,
thought that you were gay.

165
00:12:52,487 --> 00:12:54,216
Don't worry, I set her straight.

166
00:12:59,494 --> 00:13:01,018
Bye.

167
00:13:19,681 --> 00:13:21,171
Hi.

168
00:13:21,349 --> 00:13:26,184
Oh, I was thinking about you
all night long.

169
00:13:27,422 --> 00:13:31,085
Oh, I'm sorry I didn't answer
on the first ring.

170
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:32,920
It's not my fault.

171
00:13:33,094 --> 00:13:35,494
I was thinking about
what you were gonna do to me...

172
00:13:35,663 --> 00:13:40,498
...and I just couldn't wait.
I didn't have a free hand.

173
00:13:40,668 --> 00:13:47,506
Oh, baby.
You know just how Katia likes it. Mm.

174
00:13:48,376 --> 00:13:51,004
Well, it's Valentine's Day, sugar.

175
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:53,443
How about something special?

176
00:13:53,614 --> 00:13:57,550
My roommate just got home.
Do you wanna have a threesome?

177
00:13:57,719 --> 00:14:00,187
If he says yes,
it'll take me a minute to change.

178
00:14:02,256 --> 00:14:06,693
Ooh. I think that's a very good idea.

179
00:14:29,951 --> 00:14:33,512
Edgar, we said we were not gonna
give each other presents this year.

180
00:14:33,688 --> 00:14:36,179
I know, I lied.

181
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:39,924
- So did I.
- Wow.

182
00:14:40,094 --> 00:14:44,155
<i>Today's the day I make most of my dough.
I deliver love-grams to businesses.</i>

183
00:14:44,332 --> 00:14:46,163
<i>I even delivered a breakup-gram today.</i>

184
00:14:46,334 --> 00:14:48,666
<i>Folks, from the chubby messenger
of love himself...</i>

185
00:14:48,836 --> 00:14:50,599
<i>...that Valentine's Day is about love.</i>

186
00:14:50,772 --> 00:14:53,104
<i>It's about romance.
It's about commercialism that...</i>

187
00:14:53,274 --> 00:14:55,902
- Found the glue, Grandma.
- Well, good.

188
00:14:56,677 --> 00:14:58,838
This is really a hard day for him...

189
00:14:59,013 --> 00:15:02,847
...because they used to make
handcrafted cards together.

190
00:15:03,017 --> 00:15:05,485
Well, maybe we should've offered
to do that with him.

191
00:15:05,653 --> 00:15:06,677
I did.

192
00:15:06,854 --> 00:15:09,755
But he said it was only fun
when it was with his mother.

193
00:15:10,792 --> 00:15:13,454
So, Edison...

194
00:15:13,895 --> 00:15:18,127
...what are we doing for breakfast today?
- I can't eat, Grandpa.

195
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:20,790
Who said that? So you can't eat?

196
00:15:20,968 --> 00:15:23,801
What's the matter?
What's the matter, you sick?

197
00:15:24,272 --> 00:15:27,241
Yeah. Lovesick.

198
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:32,206
<i>Julia, it's Reed.
I've been trying to reach you.</i>

199
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,438
<i>Call me back, please.</i>

200
00:15:37,552 --> 00:15:39,281
Oh, boy. Oh.

201
00:15:39,453 --> 00:15:42,217
- Hi.
- Hi.

202
00:15:43,157 --> 00:15:45,955
So my boyfriend texted me this morning.

203
00:15:46,127 --> 00:15:49,187
And he was like,
"Look outside your door."

204
00:15:49,363 --> 00:15:50,591
Oh.

205
00:15:50,765 --> 00:15:53,256
And... But, you know,
I look outside my door...

206
00:15:53,434 --> 00:15:55,800
...and my boyfriend's
nowhere to be found.

207
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,028
Right.

208
00:15:57,205 --> 00:15:59,639
- But there's this giant white bear.
- Yeah, the bear.

209
00:15:59,807 --> 00:16:01,638
- On the ground. The floor.
- I get it.

210
00:16:01,809 --> 00:16:05,040
- Yeah. Isn't that the sweetest thing ever?
- Ever and ever.

211
00:16:05,546 --> 00:16:09,277
Do you live here? In this building?
Because I see you in the lobby all the time.

212
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:13,853
- Because I live here.
- No, I just visit. Just visiting.

213
00:16:14,689 --> 00:16:17,283
All right, well,
I'm gonna go to school now.

214
00:16:17,658 --> 00:16:18,955
Gonna take my bear with me.

215
00:16:19,126 --> 00:16:21,890
- I hope you get a lot of valentines today.
- Thanks.

216
00:16:24,866 --> 00:16:27,528
<i>Hello, everyone.
This is your captain speaking.</i>

217
00:16:27,702 --> 00:16:29,533
<i>On behalf of myself and the flight
deck...</i>

218
00:16:29,704 --> 00:16:32,172
<i>...we wanted to wish everyone
a happy Valentine's Day.</i>

219
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,604
<i>Hope you had an opportunity
to get a little rest.</i>

220
00:16:34,775 --> 00:16:38,438
<i>But according to my digital readout here,
we've still got another six hours...</i>

221
00:16:38,613 --> 00:16:41,605
<i>...before we reach our final destination
of Los Angeles...</i>

222
00:16:41,782 --> 00:16:46,344
<i>...where the weather is expected to be warm
and sunny after three days of rain.</i>

223
00:16:51,425 --> 00:16:52,517
- Oh, hello.
- Hey.

224
00:16:52,693 --> 00:16:55,457
- Hey, is Reed here, or is he on a run?
- Yeah, he's in there.

225
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,257
- Okay. Hey, guys.
- Hi, Julia.

226
00:16:57,431 --> 00:16:59,126
- How was last night, brutal?
- Yeah.

227
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,824
- Have you been up all night?
- Hey.

228
00:17:01,002 --> 00:17:05,302
- Wow, everybody's here today.
- Oh, whose child is this? Hello?

229
00:17:05,473 --> 00:17:08,067
- Oh, there's your mother.
- Please hold.

230
00:17:08,242 --> 00:17:09,766
- Hey, Nikki.
- Good morning.

231
00:17:09,944 --> 00:17:11,912
Oh, these are yellow. Where's Reed?

232
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,570
<i>Your pal's in the caf?
The pastries were late.</i>

233
00:17:14,749 --> 00:17:16,808
Oh, yeah. I think he might be having
a rough morning.

234
00:17:18,185 --> 00:17:19,243
Hello, Siena Bouquet.

235
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,910
- Hey. Reed.
- Just need...

236
00:17:21,088 --> 00:17:24,023
We need the morning glories.
Oh, there they are. Perfect. Great.

237
00:17:24,191 --> 00:17:27,592
- Hey, I got your message. You okay?
- Yeah.

238
00:17:27,762 --> 00:17:31,289
- What happened?
- Well, you just sounded like...

239
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:34,534
- You sounded like maybe she said...
- "Yes."

240
00:17:35,903 --> 00:17:36,927
- She said yes.
- No.

241
00:17:37,104 --> 00:17:38,765
Why doesn't anybody have confidence?

242
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,669
- She said yes?
- Yes.

243
00:17:40,841 --> 00:17:46,370
Oh, my goodness. Okay. I didn't...
I didn't get it, but congratulations!

244
00:17:46,547 --> 00:17:51,883
- Call me Mr. Engaged.
- You're getting married.

245
00:17:52,687 --> 00:17:55,087
Hi, I ordered some tulips.

246
00:17:55,256 --> 00:17:57,952
Yes. You can't put the baby on the counter,
it's dangerous.

247
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:01,390
- But I can't get my money out.
- She should be off the counter. Thanks.

248
00:18:01,562 --> 00:18:04,156
- Here, let me hold her.
- Thank you.

249
00:18:04,332 --> 00:18:07,165
- You should know we're Jewish.
- God loves us all.

250
00:18:07,335 --> 00:18:08,962
- Thank you.
- Hello, Siena Bouquet.

251
00:18:10,805 --> 00:18:13,205
He's the first decent guy
I've dated in a long time.

252
00:18:13,874 --> 00:18:15,102
It's going that well, huh?

253
00:18:15,276 --> 00:18:17,972
I am so sick of dating.
I'm so jealous of you guys.

254
00:18:18,145 --> 00:18:20,636
When do I get to meet
the phantom physician?

255
00:18:20,815 --> 00:18:23,443
- I think soon.
- You guys got plans tonight?

256
00:18:23,617 --> 00:18:27,053
No. He has to go to San Francisco,
so we're gonna talk on the phone.

257
00:18:27,688 --> 00:18:29,417
You know what you should do?

258
00:18:30,024 --> 00:18:31,753
You should fly up and surprise him.

259
00:18:31,926 --> 00:18:33,860
- You think so?
- Yeah. Why not?

260
00:18:34,028 --> 00:18:35,461
- No.
- Come on.

261
00:18:35,629 --> 00:18:37,153
I don't know where he's staying...

262
00:18:37,331 --> 00:18:40,164
You make a call, you find out.
What's the big deal?

263
00:18:40,334 --> 00:18:44,327
- God, you really think I should go?
- Why not?

264
00:18:44,505 --> 00:18:47,906
Come on, it's Valentine's Day.
You don't think. You just do.

265
00:18:52,413 --> 00:18:53,846
Go.

266
00:18:57,284 --> 00:19:00,048
- Get out of here.
- Congratulations.

267
00:19:21,442 --> 00:19:22,966
<i>- Hello there.
- Hi.</i>

268
00:19:23,144 --> 00:19:26,272
Hey, honey.
I'm just pulling into the airport.

269
00:19:26,447 --> 00:19:27,914
<i>I'll call you when I land, okay?</i>

270
00:19:28,082 --> 00:19:31,540
Okay, I get it. Okay, have a safe flight.
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

271
00:19:31,719 --> 00:19:33,448
Thanks. Bye-bye.

272
00:19:56,277 --> 00:19:58,472
Hello. Good morning. I'm home.

273
00:19:58,646 --> 00:20:00,375
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hey, peanut.

274
00:20:01,215 --> 00:20:02,910
Hi, sweetie.

275
00:20:03,084 --> 00:20:05,552
- Did you fix all the broken hearts?
- I did.

276
00:20:05,719 --> 00:20:08,119
- I did.
- Happy Valentine's Day.

277
00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:09,916
Happy Valentine's Day to you.

278
00:20:10,858 --> 00:20:14,225
- Surgery went late. I stayed at the condo.
- I figured.

279
00:20:15,362 --> 00:20:16,852
Doesn't Daddy juggle well?

280
00:20:17,031 --> 00:20:18,328
- Yeah.
- Mm-hm.

281
00:20:37,718 --> 00:20:38,742
What are you doing?

282
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:43,549
Sorry, l... Excuse me,
I was trying to close the window.

283
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:46,717
I'm sorry.

284
00:20:47,261 --> 00:20:52,255
No. For leaning on my shoulder? Come on,
it's the least I could do. A 14-hour flight.

285
00:20:53,801 --> 00:20:55,632
Oh, God, that's better.

286
00:20:56,303 --> 00:20:58,999
- You on active duty?
- Yes, sir.

287
00:20:59,173 --> 00:21:03,405
- Two bars. Is that lieutenant?
- Two bars is the captain.

288
00:21:06,113 --> 00:21:08,377
You have a loved one in L.A.?

289
00:21:10,818 --> 00:21:13,309
Well, I'm sure he'll be happy to see you.

290
00:21:15,356 --> 00:21:19,383
How long...? How long has it been
since you've been home?

291
00:21:19,793 --> 00:21:21,727
Eleven months.

292
00:21:21,896 --> 00:21:23,864
And how long do you get to stay?

293
00:21:24,031 --> 00:21:25,498
Just till tomorrow.

294
00:21:26,934 --> 00:21:31,200
Wow. Fourteen-hour flight both ways
just for one night.

295
00:21:31,372 --> 00:21:33,306
Wow, that's romantic.

296
00:21:33,474 --> 00:21:36,272
You're a romantic.
I mean, that's quite a gesture.

297
00:21:38,445 --> 00:21:40,436
That's commitment.

298
00:21:46,053 --> 00:21:47,884
You on Facebook?

299
00:21:51,091 --> 00:21:54,686
- I need some chrysanthemums.
- What? You should speak English.

300
00:21:54,862 --> 00:21:57,854
- I had to learn when I came.
- Chrysanthemums and calla lilies.

301
00:21:58,032 --> 00:22:00,057
- I don't know what it...
- Michael, calm down.

302
00:22:00,234 --> 00:22:01,861
What language do you speak in?

303
00:22:02,036 --> 00:22:05,733
I used to speak Bulgarian,
but I'm an American citizen now.

304
00:22:05,906 --> 00:22:08,807
Does anybody here speak English
with a Bulgarian accent?

305
00:22:08,976 --> 00:22:11,240
- Over here. I do.
- There he is.

306
00:22:11,412 --> 00:22:13,846
Bulgarize away. Here we go.

307
00:22:14,014 --> 00:22:16,312
There she is!
The future Mrs. Reed Bennett!

308
00:22:16,483 --> 00:22:18,474
Oh, chrysanthemums.

309
00:22:18,652 --> 00:22:20,847
- Hi, babe.
- Hi, baby.

310
00:22:21,021 --> 00:22:23,080
<i>Hello, fianc?.</i>

311
00:22:23,257 --> 00:22:26,454
It sounds weird. Have you said it yet?
Nikki, take over for a minute.

312
00:22:26,627 --> 00:22:27,821
Come this way.

313
00:22:27,995 --> 00:22:31,158
Wait, these are for you.
I knew they were for somebody.

314
00:22:31,332 --> 00:22:34,301
<i>- Sarah, have you met my fianc??
- Hi, Morley.</i>

315
00:22:34,468 --> 00:22:38,962
- Hi.
- I just like saying it. I feel so grown-up.

316
00:22:39,139 --> 00:22:40,572
Next, please!

317
00:22:40,741 --> 00:22:45,178
- Look what you forgot.
- See, that is...

318
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,648
Is one empty hand.

319
00:22:49,216 --> 00:22:51,810
Oh, yeah.

320
00:22:51,986 --> 00:22:53,180
Don't be mad.

321
00:22:53,354 --> 00:22:55,413
Mad? Why would I be mad?
I'm concerned.

322
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:58,155
Well, just...

323
00:22:58,325 --> 00:23:01,954
Do you have any idea what it would be
like at work today if I wore that thing?

324
00:23:02,129 --> 00:23:05,758
- I mean, people will be asking me...
- "Where'd you get the big ring?"

325
00:23:05,933 --> 00:23:09,835
You know, "How many bridesmaids?"
And, "How did he do it?"

326
00:23:10,004 --> 00:23:13,565
- "Gonna have kids? How many?"
- Three.

327
00:23:13,741 --> 00:23:17,336
- What?
- Two dogs, and maybe some chickens.

328
00:23:17,511 --> 00:23:21,174
- We can talk about it. We don't have to.
- Sweetheart, I just think right now...

329
00:23:21,348 --> 00:23:25,808
...it would be better if maybe
we could just keep it a secret.

330
00:23:26,153 --> 00:23:28,053
- Where are you from?
- I am from Ruse.

331
00:23:28,222 --> 00:23:31,521
All right, you guys can start
a Bulgarian village together. All right.

332
00:23:31,692 --> 00:23:34,286
Oh, my God, look, there's the bride. Hi.

333
00:23:34,461 --> 00:23:37,123
Listen, I called my BFF, Tony.
He is already on the dress.

334
00:23:37,298 --> 00:23:40,426
He does all the gowns in Vegas.
Cher, Celine, Carrot Top.

335
00:23:40,601 --> 00:23:42,933
This is going to be so much fun!
Oh, my God, it's...

336
00:23:43,103 --> 00:23:45,697
- Breathe, breathe.
- I have to breathe.

337
00:23:45,873 --> 00:23:46,897
Okay.

338
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:51,075
- See what I mean?
- Yep, I get it.

339
00:23:52,046 --> 00:23:53,274
So...

340
00:23:54,114 --> 00:23:56,582
...Iove is the problem?

341
00:23:57,418 --> 00:23:59,886
- Did you ever have it?
- Oh, yeah.

342
00:24:00,354 --> 00:24:02,584
How old were you when you got it?

343
00:24:02,756 --> 00:24:07,284
Let's see. I'd just started working
at an architectural firm...

344
00:24:07,461 --> 00:24:12,228
...and there was this beautiful young girl,
and she was studying to be an actress.

345
00:24:13,033 --> 00:24:14,557
Was your heart kind of going:

346
00:24:16,737 --> 00:24:19,672
Yeah. Yeah, just that way. It went,
bumpada, bumpada, bumpada, boom.

347
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,705
You betcha. Just like that.

348
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:24,173
One day I got up the courage
to introduce myself.

349
00:24:24,345 --> 00:24:28,805
I walk out, walked right up to her
and opened my mouth and...

350
00:24:28,982 --> 00:24:31,177
- ...nothing comes out.
- Nothing?

351
00:24:31,352 --> 00:24:37,120
Nothing. Not a peep. But she's just waiting
for me to say something, I'm like a statue.

352
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:41,159
So finally she says,
"All right, I'll meet you here at 6:30."

353
00:24:41,328 --> 00:24:43,296
She knew what you were going to say.

354
00:24:43,464 --> 00:24:48,527
Yep. Yeah. She's been reading my mind
like that for 51 years.

355
00:24:49,436 --> 00:24:51,768
The pretty girl was Grandma, right?

356
00:24:52,473 --> 00:24:55,465
The pretty girl is Grandma, right?

357
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:59,279
- When are we gonna get there, Grandpa?
- Coming up to Moorpark.

358
00:24:59,446 --> 00:25:04,008
Making a left turn right here.
What's Moorpark spelled backwards?

359
00:25:04,184 --> 00:25:06,709
- I don't know.
- "Kraproom."

360
00:25:06,887 --> 00:25:09,822
- Grandpa.
- And don't say that in school.

361
00:25:10,858 --> 00:25:12,189
Hello, Siena Bouquet.

362
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:14,520
- I'll come with you on runs.
- You got it.

363
00:25:14,695 --> 00:25:16,595
But we gotta hustle. They're flying in now.

364
00:25:16,764 --> 00:25:18,026
I'm always hustling, baby.

365
00:25:18,198 --> 00:25:21,759
No, no, no. Like, "hustle" hustle.
Like, no, don't dilly-dally, okay?

366
00:25:21,935 --> 00:25:23,766
Let me tell you, I don't dilly-dally.

367
00:25:23,937 --> 00:25:25,734
- I only upsy-daisy.
- All right.

368
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:30,675
<i>When a man loves a woman</i>

369
00:25:31,712 --> 00:25:32,872
Crazy businessman.

370
00:25:33,046 --> 00:25:37,449
This guy, like, he wants to give
family discounts to his 30 cousins.

371
00:25:38,152 --> 00:25:40,746
What is this?
What have you got going...?

372
00:25:43,323 --> 00:25:45,518
Excuse me. Can I help you?

373
00:25:46,827 --> 00:25:49,819
I'd like to send a dozen of those
to the best girl at my school.

374
00:25:49,997 --> 00:25:52,989
- And this musical card.
- A dozen of those with thi...?

375
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,760
This... It's...

376
00:25:58,806 --> 00:26:00,398
Okay.

377
00:26:01,608 --> 00:26:06,011
- All right, where am I sending these to?
- Falcon Crest Elementary.

378
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,408
You can MapQuest it.

379
00:26:07,581 --> 00:26:10,448
I actually know where it's at.
I got a friend that goes there.

380
00:26:10,617 --> 00:26:13,882
Cool. During recess
would be the best time.

381
00:26:14,054 --> 00:26:17,683
When you get there, just hand me
the flowers, and I'll do the rest.

382
00:26:17,858 --> 00:26:21,385
- Okay?
- I'll be there. Thank you, sir.

383
00:26:21,562 --> 00:26:24,258
What's up with the cutest kid in the world
coming in here?

384
00:26:24,431 --> 00:26:29,027
And he shorted me. He just gave me, like,
15 bucks for a $55 arrangement.

385
00:26:29,203 --> 00:26:32,798
- Could I please have my receipt?
- What, did you get audited last year?

386
00:26:32,973 --> 00:26:33,997
I did.

387
00:26:34,174 --> 00:26:38,008
They always get the good guys,
I'm telling you. Here.

388
00:26:38,579 --> 00:26:40,069
Thanks.

389
00:26:44,718 --> 00:26:46,549
So, like, last night, amazing.

390
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,211
This morning,
she couldn't get away fast enough.

391
00:26:49,389 --> 00:26:53,291
Any chance there was a little, shall we say,
disappointment on her part?

392
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,896
No. What? No. None.

393
00:26:57,064 --> 00:26:58,156
At all.

394
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:03,493
- Well... No, no, no. It was fine.
- Fine's not good enough, dude.

395
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:06,161
It was better than fine.
It was a solid A.

396
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,306
Minus. B plus, A minus. A minus.

397
00:27:09,476 --> 00:27:11,706
I hate Valentine's Day.

398
00:27:11,879 --> 00:27:15,713
Why can't these guys deliver their
flowers to their girlfriends themselves?

399
00:27:16,383 --> 00:27:18,943
- Wait, what?
- They just dump them in the mailroom.

400
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:22,418
- I mean, if they don't wanna take the time to...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

401
00:27:22,589 --> 00:27:25,456
- It's Valentine's Day today?
- Hello?

402
00:27:25,626 --> 00:27:27,218
Happy Valentine's Day.

403
00:27:27,394 --> 00:27:30,955
Wha...? No, it's a Monday.
Valentine's Day always falls on a Thursday.

404
00:27:31,131 --> 00:27:33,998
That's Thanksgiving, Hoosier-head.

405
00:27:34,334 --> 00:27:38,327
- Really?
- You're 25. You thought that for 25 years?

406
00:27:38,505 --> 00:27:41,770
Dude, he's from Indiana.
They only celebrate Love Your Cousin Day.

407
00:27:41,942 --> 00:27:45,935
No, you're thinking of Kentucky. Of course
Liz was acting weird this morning.

408
00:27:46,113 --> 00:27:48,479
You do have something planned
for tonight, right?

409
00:27:48,649 --> 00:27:53,143
How could I have something planned for
tonight? I didn't even know until right now.

410
00:27:53,754 --> 00:27:57,918
I can do my lunch break,
and I can do after 5?

411
00:27:58,091 --> 00:28:00,184
Okay, great.

412
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,553
No, no, no.
I don't mind people with fetishes.

413
00:28:02,729 --> 00:28:06,324
No, no, no, very creative people.
I gotta put you on hold, sorry.

414
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,092
Good morning.

415
00:28:09,937 --> 00:28:13,703
- You're a strong, confident person.
- Good morning. Who are you?

416
00:28:13,874 --> 00:28:16,809
I am Liz. I am one of the receptionists.
I'm subbing for Monica.

417
00:28:16,977 --> 00:28:19,741
Oh, yeah, Monica,
because she wanted today off.

418
00:28:19,913 --> 00:28:21,540
Shit, she has a life.

419
00:28:22,015 --> 00:28:24,677
She had a funeral, which is a life,
I guess.

420
00:28:24,851 --> 00:28:26,546
Well, Liz, I'm Paula.

421
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,180
I know they call me Bipolar Paula. Don't.
But you should know I'm in crisis.

422
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:33,859
- Okay.
- I don't wanna talk about it.

423
00:28:34,027 --> 00:28:36,222
- Okay.
- It has nothing to do with being alone...

424
00:28:36,396 --> 00:28:38,455
- ...on Valentine's Day.
- Of course not.

425
00:28:38,632 --> 00:28:42,432
And everything to do with the client
in crisis.

426
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:46,367
- That sounds challenging.
- "Challenging"?

427
00:28:46,807 --> 00:28:49,435
Gotta figure out if he still has
an athletic career.

428
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:52,511
If he doesn't, big fat problemo.

429
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:54,840
Well, I'm here
to help you solve that problem.

430
00:28:55,882 --> 00:28:57,543
Who's on hold?

431
00:28:58,518 --> 00:29:00,145
My mother.

432
00:29:01,021 --> 00:29:02,488
I'm sorry.

433
00:29:04,424 --> 00:29:06,722
Hangs up on her own mother.

434
00:29:06,893 --> 00:29:08,622
That's cold.

435
00:29:08,795 --> 00:29:09,887
We might just get along.

436
00:29:26,613 --> 00:29:28,137
<i>Hello, I'm Hannah Storm.</i>

437
00:29:28,315 --> 00:29:30,476
<i>And with football season officially
over...</i>

438
00:29:30,651 --> 00:29:33,984
<i>...the only lingering question is:
What will Sean Jackson do?</i>

439
00:29:34,154 --> 00:29:37,089
<i>A devastating loss
in the championship game last week...</i>

440
00:29:37,257 --> 00:29:38,815
<i>...leaves his future in question.</i>

441
00:29:38,992 --> 00:29:41,460
<i>His contract is up, and at age 35...</i>

442
00:29:41,628 --> 00:29:44,597
<i>...he's one of the oldest quarterbacks
in the league.</i>

443
00:29:44,765 --> 00:29:46,232
<i>Does his team want him back?</i>

444
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,460
<i>Of course I want Sean Jackson back.
But it's not my decision.</i>

445
00:29:49,636 --> 00:29:52,002
<i>If not,
will he test the waters of free agency?</i>

446
00:29:53,573 --> 00:29:55,905
<i>Or will he make this easier on
everyone...</i>

447
00:29:56,076 --> 00:29:57,668
<i>...and just retire?</i>

448
00:29:57,844 --> 00:30:00,938
Come on, Hannah. Lighten up.

449
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:07,580
Hi, neighbor!

450
00:30:07,754 --> 00:30:09,221
- Hey, Sean.
- Hey, girls.

451
00:30:09,389 --> 00:30:11,584
Hey, when are you gonna come over
for a swim?

452
00:30:11,758 --> 00:30:14,750
Oh, sorry, sweetie.
I got lots going on today.

453
00:30:14,928 --> 00:30:18,523
- I'm running out of patience.
- And I'm running out of willpower.

454
00:30:18,699 --> 00:30:21,361
But right now, I gotta make a call.

455
00:30:40,353 --> 00:30:42,719
No. Uh-oh.

456
00:30:43,156 --> 00:30:46,148
Help, Heather!

457
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,354
I'm coming, I'm coming! Yeah, hello?

458
00:30:49,529 --> 00:30:50,689
<i>Kara, it's Sean.</i>

459
00:30:50,864 --> 00:30:53,662
Hi, hi. What's going on?
What's going on?

460
00:30:53,834 --> 00:30:57,895
<i>- Media blitz on my career has begun.
- Yes, I know. Are you okay?</i>

461
00:30:58,071 --> 00:31:00,562
Of course I'm okay.
It comes with the territory.

462
00:31:00,741 --> 00:31:03,835
What I'd love is for
my highly paid publicist to take care of it.

463
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:07,707
I'm on it. I've got my people standing by
and a press release ready to go.

464
00:31:07,881 --> 00:31:10,645
- What else?
- I got a meeting with my agent today.

465
00:31:10,817 --> 00:31:14,014
<i>I want you to meet me there
in about an hour. You'll be there?</i>

466
00:31:15,355 --> 00:31:19,917
<i>Hello? Hello? Did I lose you?</i>

467
00:31:20,827 --> 00:31:24,194
<i>Malibu. You pay a fortune to be here to get
crappy cell phone reception.</i>

468
00:31:24,364 --> 00:31:27,333
No, no. I'm here. I'm here.
I'll be at the meeting.

469
00:31:27,501 --> 00:31:29,526
<i>Outstanding.</i>

470
00:31:30,437 --> 00:31:32,234
Drumline, keep your eyes on Scotty.

471
00:31:32,405 --> 00:31:37,206
Registration for the AP exam
is due next week, so don't flake.

472
00:31:38,211 --> 00:31:39,838
Hey, Grace.

473
00:31:40,013 --> 00:31:44,814
I was thinking of putting together
just a little test-prep group for the class...

474
00:31:44,985 --> 00:31:48,546
...and I was hoping I could pick your brain
about what to focus on...

475
00:31:48,722 --> 00:31:52,249
...since you've taken the test,
and I've... I haven't.

476
00:31:52,425 --> 00:31:57,522
- Yeah, yeah. You know, no problem.
- Oh, great. How about today after school?

477
00:31:57,697 --> 00:32:00,131
You know, I can't today.
I nanny after school.

478
00:32:00,834 --> 00:32:03,302
How about today at lunch?

479
00:32:03,804 --> 00:32:06,500
Uh. See, normally that would
work for me...

480
00:32:06,673 --> 00:32:11,872
...but today at lunch, I'm gonna have
sex with my boyfriend for the first time.

481
00:32:12,045 --> 00:32:17,574
- First time having sex for both of us.
- That is quite a special time for you.

482
00:32:17,751 --> 00:32:21,380
It's Valentine's Day,
we're in love, we're both 18...

483
00:32:21,555 --> 00:32:23,580
...and I just want it to be special and...

484
00:32:23,757 --> 00:32:26,692
The point is, my parents work,
so they'll be gone during lunch.

485
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:30,853
Lunch is the only time it can work out.
You know, I'm free tomorrow lunchtime.

486
00:32:31,031 --> 00:32:35,593
- Lunchtime tomorrow, I'll definitely be free.
- Oh, you'll be done having sex by then?

487
00:32:35,902 --> 00:32:38,462
- Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow. It'll be good.
- All right.

488
00:32:38,638 --> 00:32:39,935
Bye.

489
00:32:42,242 --> 00:32:45,268
Come sign
the latte petition. Right here, kids.

490
00:32:45,445 --> 00:32:47,970
- Yeah. Right here.
- Okay.

491
00:32:49,716 --> 00:32:52,378
- You're gonna eat first?
- No.

492
00:32:52,552 --> 00:32:55,043
No? Maybe some Gatorade.

493
00:32:55,222 --> 00:32:57,486
That's... Yeah, I don't wanna
get dehydrated.

494
00:32:57,657 --> 00:33:00,524
- You're not gonna eat lunch?
- No. No lunch.

495
00:33:00,694 --> 00:33:04,130
- Well, did you have a big breakfast?
- No.

496
00:33:04,297 --> 00:33:07,994
Do pushups. I'm telling you,
I do them before I run.

497
00:33:08,168 --> 00:33:13,435
- What? Pushups make you run faster?
- No. Makes you look better.

498
00:33:13,607 --> 00:33:15,575
I'll get you a sandwich
when you come back.

499
00:33:15,742 --> 00:33:18,233
- Yeah, thanks. That's a good idea.
- Save the lattes.

500
00:33:18,411 --> 00:33:22,142
They're putting lattes
in the vending machines? Finally.

501
00:33:22,315 --> 00:33:24,340
- Hey.
- So I'm gonna go to English...

502
00:33:24,517 --> 00:33:26,985
- ...and then I'm gonna go set up.
- I'll see you there.

503
00:33:27,153 --> 00:33:28,518
All right.

504
00:33:30,657 --> 00:33:32,022
Thank you, Felicia.

505
00:33:32,192 --> 00:33:34,626
Mr. Schwabbe, I'm so glad you're
taking care of this.

506
00:33:34,794 --> 00:33:37,024
- You got it.
- And I like caramel lattes...

507
00:33:37,197 --> 00:33:39,825
- ...just, like, FYI.
- Duly noted.

508
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,331
Have fun at lunch!

509
00:33:44,738 --> 00:33:46,501
What do you think?

510
00:33:47,774 --> 00:33:49,139
We're gonna wait.

511
00:33:49,309 --> 00:33:51,402
I think we should just, like,
enjoy this time.

512
00:33:51,578 --> 00:33:55,981
- Yeah. Okay. Good.
- Did you like your gift?

513
00:33:56,149 --> 00:33:59,846
- I didn't open it yet.
- You need to open it.

514
00:34:02,322 --> 00:34:04,654
It's... It's my track shirt.

515
00:34:04,824 --> 00:34:08,954
Yeah, but I ironed on your lucky number
on the back.

516
00:34:09,129 --> 00:34:10,255
Thirteen.

517
00:34:11,064 --> 00:34:13,396
But that's your lucky number.

518
00:34:13,767 --> 00:34:14,893
You don't even like it.

519
00:34:15,068 --> 00:34:19,732
- No. No, I love it. I can't wait to wear it.
- Okay.

520
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,567
- Try it on now, then.
- Now?

521
00:34:22,742 --> 00:34:24,039
- Yeah.
- Well...

522
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:27,373
...you know, a little uncomfortable
taking my shirt off in public.

523
00:34:28,548 --> 00:34:32,177
- But, hey, I'll wear it later, okay?
- Okay.

524
00:34:32,652 --> 00:34:35,177
Are you gonna carry it around all day?

525
00:34:35,355 --> 00:34:36,720
Shut up.

526
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:38,949
- Let's see if this fits in my locker.
- Right.

527
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:42,522
This is his fifth paternity test.
What are we talking about?

528
00:34:46,132 --> 00:34:49,533
So I spoke with the GM. They passed.

529
00:34:49,703 --> 00:34:51,102
Passed?

530
00:34:51,271 --> 00:34:54,331
We got to the playoffs. I was all-league.

531
00:34:54,507 --> 00:34:57,738
They decided to go another way.
They're chasing that kid from Alabama.

532
00:34:57,911 --> 00:35:00,937
I'm working on a press release
saying it was a mutual parting.

533
00:35:01,114 --> 00:35:05,312
- Well, so now what?
- Well, we... We look for another team.

534
00:35:05,485 --> 00:35:08,045
I don't know. Maybe I'm done.

535
00:35:08,221 --> 00:35:09,984
- You're not done.
- Absolutely not.

536
00:35:10,156 --> 00:35:13,284
And I'm not speaking as someone
who makes a lot of money off of you.

537
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,984
I'm speaking as your fan.

538
00:35:15,161 --> 00:35:19,791
Right now, you can still make
a ton of money doing what you love.

539
00:35:19,966 --> 00:35:23,868
Well, the problem is, Paula,
it's not the only thing I want out of life.

540
00:35:24,037 --> 00:35:26,403
A relationship. Kids.

541
00:35:26,573 --> 00:35:28,768
Well, you can still have that
and play football.

542
00:35:28,942 --> 00:35:31,502
Look, I'm not complaining.
I've been lucky. But...

543
00:35:31,678 --> 00:35:33,942
So, what is he telling me?
What are we gonna do?

544
00:35:35,148 --> 00:35:39,847
I think we should take a beat
and let Sean think about what he wants.

545
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,749
- Right?
- Right.

546
00:35:41,921 --> 00:35:44,412
We have no time for thinking.

547
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:47,189
Put it on their tab.

548
00:35:49,829 --> 00:35:51,387
- Come on!
- Ha-ha-ha!

549
00:35:51,564 --> 00:35:53,293
- That's seven in a row.
- It's amazing.

550
00:35:53,466 --> 00:35:55,331
You are like... This woman's a shark.

551
00:35:55,502 --> 00:35:57,527
- You are good at this game.
- Not really.

552
00:35:57,704 --> 00:36:02,767
Just witnessed a tactical game of reading
your opponent and adjusting accordingly.

553
00:36:02,942 --> 00:36:05,911
Wait, are you saying
that you're reading me?

554
00:36:07,313 --> 00:36:08,871
Thank you.

555
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:12,983
- Happy Valentine's Day.
- Oh, thank you.

556
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:19,283
Yes, I can read you.
It's part of my training.

557
00:36:19,459 --> 00:36:20,949
Everyone gives subtle hints.

558
00:36:21,127 --> 00:36:22,890
- Hints? Like what?
- Giveaways.

559
00:36:23,063 --> 00:36:25,691
You boarded the plane wearing a suit
but no wedding ring.

560
00:36:25,865 --> 00:36:27,492
Serious, but not committed.

561
00:36:27,667 --> 00:36:29,828
You let a stranger
sleep on your shoulder.

562
00:36:30,003 --> 00:36:33,495
Kindness, but also feels good
to be needed.

563
00:36:33,673 --> 00:36:37,074
The heart-shaped candy.
Another giveaway.

564
00:36:37,944 --> 00:36:41,004
Either you have a problem with sugar,
which, based on the syrup...

565
00:36:41,181 --> 00:36:43,706
...you put on your pancakes,
I wouldn't think so.

566
00:36:43,883 --> 00:36:46,818
Or you have a problem with candy
in the shape of a heart.

567
00:36:46,986 --> 00:36:49,682
Which means you might have a problem
with romance...

568
00:36:49,856 --> 00:36:52,984
...and things pertaining to this day
in particular.

569
00:36:56,663 --> 00:36:58,824
Not bad, soldier.

570
00:36:59,699 --> 00:37:01,633
Okay, Edison. Thank you very much.

571
00:37:01,801 --> 00:37:04,668
Now you all have seen how to properly
place your valentines...

572
00:37:04,838 --> 00:37:07,932
...into our fabulous envelopes,
go ahead. Great.

573
00:37:08,108 --> 00:37:12,010
And while you are doing that quietly,
a little history about Valentine's Day.

574
00:37:12,178 --> 00:37:15,875
Valentine's Day was a massacre in
Chicago where they shot everybody...

575
00:37:16,049 --> 00:37:18,381
...and put a curse on the Chicago Cubs.

576
00:37:19,252 --> 00:37:22,949
Thank you, Franklin, but this
is a different Valentine's Day. Lose the hat.

577
00:37:23,123 --> 00:37:25,023
Okay, in ancient Rome...

578
00:37:25,191 --> 00:37:29,093
...Emperor Claudius II, who was also
known as Claudius the Cruel.

579
00:37:29,963 --> 00:37:32,261
Claudius the Cruel banned all marriages...

580
00:37:32,432 --> 00:37:35,094
...because he wanted his soldiers
to concentrate on war.

581
00:37:35,268 --> 00:37:38,294
But there was a priest who was known
as Valentine...

582
00:37:38,471 --> 00:37:42,032
...who secretly married everyone anyway
because he believed in love.

583
00:37:42,208 --> 00:37:45,541
Claudius found out about the marriages,
and he threw Valentine in jail...

584
00:37:45,712 --> 00:37:47,543
Girls. I'm watching you.

585
00:37:47,714 --> 00:37:48,942
Thank you.

586
00:37:49,115 --> 00:37:52,346
Anyway, on February the 14th,
Valentine wrote a note to his beloved...

587
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:56,979
...and he signed it:
"Farewell, from your Valentine."

588
00:37:58,124 --> 00:38:01,457
Let's see. Are there any questions?

589
00:38:03,029 --> 00:38:05,122
Franklin, I can't wait to hear this.
Go ahead.

590
00:38:05,732 --> 00:38:08,963
Miss Fitzpatrick,
are you in love with anyone?

591
00:38:13,206 --> 00:38:14,400
I saw you on TV today.

592
00:38:14,908 --> 00:38:16,671
- Was it on?
- Yeah, that's why I'm here.

593
00:38:16,843 --> 00:38:18,708
Yes. We're famous!

594
00:38:18,878 --> 00:38:20,641
- Yay, we're famous.
- Yes.

595
00:38:20,813 --> 00:38:22,280
So you're the owner, I take it.

596
00:38:22,448 --> 00:38:25,315
Yeah, tech... Yes.
My grandfather actually started it in Italy.

597
00:38:25,485 --> 00:38:27,919
Yeah, my dad brought it over,
but now I got the shop.

598
00:38:28,087 --> 00:38:29,918
That's great. It's a family business.

599
00:38:30,089 --> 00:38:32,353
Look, I hate to play this card,
but I'm a doctor.

600
00:38:32,525 --> 00:38:35,892
I have surgery in an hour and a half.
Is there any way you could help me?

601
00:38:36,062 --> 00:38:37,154
- Say no more.
- Thank you.

602
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:41,130
Could I get an order form, please,
for the great doctor here?

603
00:38:41,301 --> 00:38:43,326
I need two arrangements.

604
00:38:43,503 --> 00:38:46,836
Something special, long-stemmed roses for
each one of my...

605
00:38:47,006 --> 00:38:48,439
...ladies.

606
00:38:48,875 --> 00:38:50,274
I need your discretion.

607
00:38:51,044 --> 00:38:52,978
We have an understanding, right?

608
00:38:53,146 --> 00:38:55,046
I understand. There's a florist code.

609
00:38:55,215 --> 00:38:58,844
Great. Here's the credit card.
And here are the addresses.

610
00:38:59,018 --> 00:39:01,987
These are the addresses for the ladies.

611
00:39:03,556 --> 00:39:06,491
- Harrison Copeland?
- Yes, you need... You want some ID?

612
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:11,094
Nope. Should be good. Uh...

613
00:39:11,264 --> 00:39:14,700
Okay, this Julia Fitzpatrick,
that would be your...

614
00:39:14,867 --> 00:39:15,891
...girlfriend.

615
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:20,263
- Yes.
- And this Pamela Copeland...

616
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,136
...it's the same last name as you.
Would that be your wife?

617
00:39:23,309 --> 00:39:24,333
Yes.

618
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:28,640
I thought we had some sort of code,
understanding.

619
00:39:28,815 --> 00:39:32,649
The code is the code. I just wanna
make sure that your understanding...

620
00:39:32,819 --> 00:39:36,311
...is the same understanding
as my understanding. Understand?

621
00:39:36,489 --> 00:39:39,925
- Yeah, can you run the card, please?
- Yep.

622
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:43,058
Thank you. I have to get my wallet.
I'll be right back.

623
00:40:08,388 --> 00:40:11,789
- Wish me luck.
- All us virgins are pulling for you. Whoo!

624
00:40:11,958 --> 00:40:14,927
If you need any help, text me.

625
00:40:36,582 --> 00:40:38,209
Pushkin.

626
00:40:40,386 --> 00:40:42,718
Good girl. Go play.

627
00:40:50,963 --> 00:40:53,659
Pushkin, no. Downstairs, Pushkin.

628
00:40:58,371 --> 00:40:59,929
One...

629
00:41:18,191 --> 00:41:23,424
<i>Oh, Grace
When I saw your face</i>

630
00:41:45,318 --> 00:41:47,218
<i>Oh, Grace</i>

631
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:53,791
Hey, you. Come on.
Mommy's home for a minute.

632
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,952
Wha...? Come on, sweetie.

633
00:41:57,130 --> 00:42:02,067
<i>Made my heart race
Like a high-speed chase</i>

634
00:42:03,136 --> 00:42:04,797
<i>- Grace
- Grace?</i>

635
00:42:04,971 --> 00:42:05,995
Oh, my...! Alex!

636
00:42:06,172 --> 00:42:09,903
- Holy... Mrs. Smart. Oh, my gosh!
- What are you doing here?

637
00:42:10,076 --> 00:42:13,568
I'm rehearsing!

638
00:42:13,746 --> 00:42:17,182
- Naked?
- Naked! Yes!

639
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:20,683
It's... It's experiment...

640
00:42:20,853 --> 00:42:25,347
I'm doing an... Ow! Experimental show.
It's very, very avant-garde type of thing.

641
00:42:25,525 --> 00:42:28,358
And the... Oh, shit! I mean, excuse me!

642
00:42:28,528 --> 00:42:31,395
- It's okay. I've heard the word before.
- Not shit!

643
00:42:31,564 --> 00:42:34,260
God, look at the time. I gotta go.
Thank you for everything, though.

644
00:42:34,434 --> 00:42:35,458
Ow!

645
00:42:35,635 --> 00:42:36,624
- I'm so sorry!
- It's okay.

646
00:42:36,803 --> 00:42:38,236
- Are you okay?
- Please! Do not come closer.

647
00:42:38,404 --> 00:42:40,838
This does not look right, Alex.

648
00:42:41,007 --> 00:42:43,942
- Thanks for everything and...
- Oh, my God.

649
00:42:44,677 --> 00:42:47,703
- No, Pushkin. Pushkin, no.
- Pushkin. Pushkin.

650
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,871
That's okay.
You know what, I'm gonna just...

651
00:42:50,049 --> 00:42:53,018
All right. Breathe. Oh, my goodness.
All right.

652
00:42:53,186 --> 00:42:56,622
See you very soon, Mrs. Smart! Bye-bye.

653
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,088
Alex, honey, cover your hoo-hoo!

654
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:19,236
- Grace! Grace!
- What are you doing? What happened?

655
00:43:19,412 --> 00:43:21,346
- Mom.
- What, your mom?

656
00:43:21,514 --> 00:43:25,382
- Yeah, sure. My mom was at your house.
- Wha...?

657
00:43:25,551 --> 00:43:29,043
- My mom. What did you say?
- That I was rehearsing.

658
00:43:29,222 --> 00:43:31,520
Naked? Did she buy it?

659
00:43:31,691 --> 00:43:35,149
I think so.
My fear made me very convincing.

660
00:43:35,328 --> 00:43:37,159
I wrote you a song.

661
00:43:38,331 --> 00:43:40,458
If you do that again, Vladimir...

662
00:43:40,633 --> 00:43:44,899
...I will have no choice
but to get down off my horse...

663
00:43:45,071 --> 00:43:48,768
- ...and punish you.
- Hello? Who wants a valentine?

664
00:43:49,609 --> 00:43:52,806
I am wearing my thigh-high
black leather boots...

665
00:43:52,979 --> 00:43:55,607
...carrying my riding crop.

666
00:43:56,382 --> 00:44:00,284
Now pull down your pants
and bend over.

667
00:44:00,453 --> 00:44:02,819
I think this floor has the most valentines.

668
00:44:02,989 --> 00:44:05,219
What a sweet little pink ass you have.

669
00:44:05,391 --> 00:44:08,326
And I will beat it with my crop...

670
00:44:08,494 --> 00:44:12,089
...until you submit to me,
you filthy peasant.

671
00:44:12,265 --> 00:44:16,463
I will beat it, and beat it,
and beat it, and beat it.

672
00:44:18,104 --> 00:44:20,004
Thank you for calling Naughty Nymphos.

673
00:44:20,172 --> 00:44:23,107
The charge will appear on
your credit card as Vague Entertainment.

674
00:44:23,276 --> 00:44:24,573
Hi there!

675
00:44:24,744 --> 00:44:27,679
Hi. Well, if it isn't the gymnast.

676
00:44:27,847 --> 00:44:30,839
Well... Yes.

677
00:44:31,517 --> 00:44:34,816
To paraphrase some poet:

678
00:44:35,488 --> 00:44:38,355
"There's a hell of a nice universe
next door.

679
00:44:38,658 --> 00:44:41,388
- Let's go."
- E.E. Cummings.

680
00:44:41,561 --> 00:44:43,791
Yeah, E.E. Good stuff. Yeah. Good stuff.

681
00:44:43,963 --> 00:44:46,022
- I think you said he was your favorite.
- Yes.

682
00:44:46,198 --> 00:44:49,565
I did say he was my favorite.
He had me at the font.

683
00:44:49,735 --> 00:44:53,102
I feel, like, so stupid for forgetting
that it's Valentine's Day today.

684
00:44:53,272 --> 00:44:57,140
- Oh, no. It's really not a big deal.
- You know what, it is to me.

685
00:44:57,310 --> 00:45:01,508
So can I take you out tonight?

686
00:45:01,948 --> 00:45:05,475
Yes. That would be wonderful. Yes.

687
00:45:05,651 --> 00:45:08,916
- How fast does that cart go?
- Well, let's find out.

688
00:45:10,556 --> 00:45:11,580
Liz...

689
00:45:11,757 --> 00:45:17,218
...there's a man on line 2 asking me to
cover him up in Vaseline and bubble wrap.

690
00:45:17,396 --> 00:45:21,264
I'll take care of that. Damn prank callers.

691
00:45:21,434 --> 00:45:25,029
And he doesn't have a Russian accent,
so I don't think you'll need your horse.

692
00:45:25,204 --> 00:45:26,865
- You heard that?
- It's my phone line.

693
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:30,907
Oh, Paula. I'm so sorry. I am so sorry.

694
00:45:31,177 --> 00:45:32,701
Am I fired?

695
00:45:32,878 --> 00:45:35,438
It's cool.
You got a way with dirty words, I like that.

696
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:37,515
Just make sure
you answer my calls first.

697
00:45:37,683 --> 00:45:40,413
Absolutely.
Oh, you do not have to worry about...

698
00:45:40,586 --> 00:45:42,554
...that.

699
00:45:43,089 --> 00:45:45,182
Probably not gonna make
Employee of the Month.

700
00:45:53,966 --> 00:45:56,764
<i>You're listening to
"Mike and Mike in the Morning" on ESPN...</i>

701
00:45:56,936 --> 00:45:58,801
<i>...America's number one
sports talk show.</i>

702
00:45:58,971 --> 00:46:02,202
<i>And, Greeny, the news of the hour:
Sean Jackson, now a free agent.</i>

703
00:46:02,375 --> 00:46:05,208
<i>- What's he supposed to do?
- He can check out Craigslist...</i>

704
00:46:05,378 --> 00:46:06,402
<i>...see who's hiring.</i>

705
00:46:16,756 --> 00:46:19,884
Oh, man. Hey, man, you see this?

706
00:46:20,059 --> 00:46:22,118
You did this.
Man, you're gonna pay for this.

707
00:46:22,294 --> 00:46:25,092
Easy, big fella. I know it was my fault.

708
00:46:25,264 --> 00:46:29,633
If you just call my business manager,
he's got all my information.

709
00:46:29,802 --> 00:46:33,932
And I'll have my business manager call
your business manager, okay?

710
00:46:34,907 --> 00:46:39,867
Sean Jackson. Oh, man, my neck.
Oh, and my back.

711
00:46:40,046 --> 00:46:43,675
And my chest. I'm just kidding.

712
00:46:43,849 --> 00:46:46,875
- Whoa, dude, will you sign my hat?
- Sure.

713
00:46:47,053 --> 00:46:49,715
Thirty-five completions,
three touchdowns on the ground.

714
00:46:49,889 --> 00:46:52,585
They think you should hang it up.
That's gratitude for you.

715
00:46:52,758 --> 00:46:53,782
Well, thanks, buddy.

716
00:46:53,959 --> 00:46:57,451
But that door's pretty messed up.
You got another truck?

717
00:46:57,630 --> 00:46:58,961
Yeah, but I'm already behind.

718
00:46:59,131 --> 00:47:02,259
Valentine's Day is kind of a big day
flower-wise.

719
00:47:02,435 --> 00:47:06,064
I don't know why people get flowers
delivered. You can give them yourself.

720
00:47:06,238 --> 00:47:08,365
Some folks like to get flowers
at the workshop.

721
00:47:08,541 --> 00:47:13,205
To some people, love doesn't exist unless
you acknowledge it in front of other people.

722
00:47:14,647 --> 00:47:19,016
You're a superstar, Sean. Drive better.
Whoop!

723
00:47:21,954 --> 00:47:26,015
Yeah, Kara, it's me.
Listen, I know what I wanna do.

724
00:47:26,192 --> 00:47:28,057
I think.

725
00:47:57,156 --> 00:48:00,922
Oh, no, man, not today.

726
00:48:18,978 --> 00:48:20,104
So, what do I do?

727
00:48:20,279 --> 00:48:24,579
Do I tell her and break her heart,
or keep it to myself and stay out of it?

728
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:27,116
- It's none of my business.
- You want my opinion?

729
00:48:27,286 --> 00:48:29,413
Yes. No.

730
00:48:29,588 --> 00:48:31,522
Well, it depend... What's your opinion?

731
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:34,181
Ask yourself,
if the situation was reversed...

732
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,918
...what would you want her to do?

733
00:48:37,263 --> 00:48:40,630
- Why you gotta be so sensitive?
- It's because you're so fragile.

734
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:46,033
Okay, so a neutral chlorine atom
has 17 protons and 17 electrons.

735
00:48:46,205 --> 00:48:48,435
And, if these two atoms become...

736
00:48:52,244 --> 00:48:55,042
- Hi.
- This order came into the shop for you.

737
00:48:55,214 --> 00:49:00,174
- I thought I'd deliver it myself.
- Hey, guys, this is my friend, Reed.

738
00:49:00,352 --> 00:49:04,550
- Say hi.
- Hi, Reed.

739
00:49:04,723 --> 00:49:09,387
Take a look at chapter 10, section two.
Just, quietly, to yourselves.

740
00:49:10,596 --> 00:49:13,588
They're from Harrison.
Did he come into the shop? Wow.

741
00:49:14,266 --> 00:49:15,961
Did you meet him?

742
00:49:16,135 --> 00:49:18,729
I kind of need to talk to you.
Do you have a second?

743
00:49:19,605 --> 00:49:21,095
Yeah, sure.

744
00:49:21,273 --> 00:49:23,639
Edison, you're in charge.

745
00:49:28,514 --> 00:49:32,610
- Recess. Let's party.
- Sit down, and be quiet. Got that?

746
00:49:32,785 --> 00:49:35,117
I'm just glad you got to see them.
They're so cute.

747
00:49:35,287 --> 00:49:37,585
- Yeah. They're great.
- Hey, guess what.

748
00:49:37,756 --> 00:49:40,816
I got a flight. I'm leaving at 5:30.
I'll be there by dinner.

749
00:49:40,993 --> 00:49:44,121
You know what, actually,
I don't think it's a good idea.

750
00:49:44,296 --> 00:49:47,527
- Why? It was your idea.
- Well, sometimes I have bad ideas.

751
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:48,928
It was a genius idea.

752
00:49:49,101 --> 00:49:51,934
- Mr. Bouquet, what about my flowers?
- Is everything okay?

753
00:49:52,104 --> 00:49:56,063
- I gave you $13.
- Oh, right. I remember.

754
00:49:56,242 --> 00:49:59,871
Yeah, they're probably on the truck.
Don't worry, man, they'll be here soon.

755
00:50:00,045 --> 00:50:04,106
Edison, I've known Mr. Bouquet
for a long, long time.

756
00:50:04,283 --> 00:50:07,548
If he tells you your flowers are gonna
be here, then they will be here.

757
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:11,121
Just give me 30 seconds.
Hold down the fort. I'll be right back.

758
00:50:11,523 --> 00:50:13,388
Don't get on the plane.

759
00:50:14,994 --> 00:50:16,018
Why not?

760
00:50:18,898 --> 00:50:20,490
You're sweet.

761
00:50:20,666 --> 00:50:22,657
Is this because Harrison
came into the shop?

762
00:50:24,036 --> 00:50:28,564
And it made you realize that things
could change between us.

763
00:50:29,141 --> 00:50:30,574
No, it's not about me.

764
00:50:30,743 --> 00:50:34,008
Because up to now, all these years,
I've just been there for you.

765
00:50:34,179 --> 00:50:36,204
And with Morley, if she works late...

766
00:50:36,382 --> 00:50:38,942
...if you wanna see a bad movie
she doesn't wanna see...

767
00:50:39,118 --> 00:50:42,110
...or if you wanna have junk food
that she's not gonna have...

768
00:50:42,288 --> 00:50:45,416
- ...I'm clearly your go-to girl.
- And you're the best.

769
00:50:45,591 --> 00:50:49,584
And now, there's this guy in the mix.
And he's not just a guy...

770
00:50:50,496 --> 00:50:51,827
...he's a man.

771
00:50:51,997 --> 00:50:54,693
- You're afraid he's gonna steal me?
- No. When he came in...

772
00:50:54,867 --> 00:50:56,528
Because, listen, since l...

773
00:50:59,405 --> 00:51:01,373
- I'm your buddy. Don't worry.
- I know.

774
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:03,167
I'm not going anywhere.

775
00:51:05,811 --> 00:51:08,473
But thanks for coming. I'll call you later.

776
00:51:08,647 --> 00:51:11,081
Hey, what's happening in here?
Get back in your seat!

777
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:12,683
What in the... Stop that.

778
00:51:12,851 --> 00:51:16,082
Get back. That is enough.

779
00:51:16,255 --> 00:51:19,315
Have you lost your minds?
To your seat. That's it, that's it.

780
00:51:19,491 --> 00:51:22,619
I can't talk right now!
I'll have to call you later!

781
00:51:23,595 --> 00:51:26,155
Break it up. Let's go. Come on.

782
00:51:30,569 --> 00:51:34,130
Stop it. Stop looking at me like that.
I tried to tell her.

783
00:51:34,306 --> 00:51:36,331
Not hard enough, Reed.

784
00:51:36,742 --> 00:51:38,903
- You don't know.
- Oh, I don't know?

785
00:51:39,078 --> 00:51:41,410
No, you've never seen her sad.

786
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:44,242
She looks like an abandoned puppy dog
when she cries.

787
00:51:44,416 --> 00:51:45,747
I'm not gonna do that to her.

788
00:51:45,918 --> 00:51:48,910
Especially not today.
I'm not gonna ruin Valentine's Day for her.

789
00:51:49,088 --> 00:51:53,684
I know what day it is. We got a van full
of flowers. At least hurry up. We're behind.

790
00:51:53,859 --> 00:51:55,588
You can't rush love.

791
00:51:55,761 --> 00:52:00,391
I'm gonna drop this off in the bedroom
before Morley gets home. I'll be right back.

792
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,093
He's not gonna hurry.

793
00:52:03,569 --> 00:52:04,593
I'm gonna fish.

794
00:52:15,114 --> 00:52:17,605
- Hey, how was your day?
- Go, go.

795
00:52:17,783 --> 00:52:18,841
- What...?
- Go!

796
00:52:19,018 --> 00:52:20,178
No, wait.

797
00:52:20,352 --> 00:52:25,016
- I want to get out of here.
- Okay, breathe. Like I taught you.

798
00:52:25,491 --> 00:52:27,186
All right, now tell me what's wrong.

799
00:52:27,793 --> 00:52:29,420
She doesn't know I love her.

800
00:52:29,595 --> 00:52:32,189
She didn't get her flowers.
She doesn't know.

801
00:52:32,364 --> 00:52:36,164
I need to make things right.
Will you please help me, Grace? Please?

802
00:52:36,335 --> 00:52:39,099
Of course. But first, soccer.

803
00:52:43,509 --> 00:52:45,534
Hang on. Okay, I can hear you now.

804
00:52:47,112 --> 00:52:50,639
Okay. It's gonna be me all alone
at my own party.

805
00:52:50,816 --> 00:52:54,980
Nobody R.S.V.P.'s. It's L.A. Everyone wants
you to think they have a life.

806
00:52:55,154 --> 00:52:58,248
- I hate you being so in love.
- Oh, I know. Thank you.

807
00:52:58,424 --> 00:53:01,951
Speaking of which, I am going to
San Francisco. Sorry I won't be there.

808
00:53:03,128 --> 00:53:05,995
Whack the heart for me, honey.
I gotta go. Bye.

809
00:53:11,537 --> 00:53:14,028
Carmine, relax. It's me.

810
00:53:15,874 --> 00:53:17,000
- Hey.
- Reed.

811
00:53:18,644 --> 00:53:22,239
What are you doing here? Are you okay?
Is it...?

812
00:53:27,386 --> 00:53:29,320
I'm sorry.

813
00:53:29,488 --> 00:53:31,547
I love you.

814
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:36,222
But I'm just not ready
for this kind of commitment.

815
00:53:36,695 --> 00:53:40,324
And I didn't know that this morning.

816
00:53:43,402 --> 00:53:45,199
No, it's okay.

817
00:53:46,205 --> 00:53:48,696
I shouldn't have rushed it. We can wait.

818
00:53:48,874 --> 00:53:51,001
You didn't do anything wrong.

819
00:53:51,176 --> 00:53:54,077
I shouldn't have been surprised
when you asked.

820
00:53:54,246 --> 00:53:57,147
I should be thinking
about our future together.

821
00:53:57,316 --> 00:54:00,183
But I'm still focused on my future.

822
00:54:01,587 --> 00:54:04,954
Look, you can still have your career,
baby.

823
00:54:05,124 --> 00:54:10,061
We're getting married.
We're not becoming monks or something.

824
00:54:10,229 --> 00:54:14,427
And then there's the whole thing
with my parents' horrible...

825
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:18,195
Your parents? Wait a second. Just because
your parents had a bad divorce...

826
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:20,998
...does not mean that you're going to have
a bad divorce.

827
00:54:21,173 --> 00:54:24,631
They're not hereditary.
It's not like it's contagious, all right?

828
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:27,401
You're not getting it.

829
00:54:27,579 --> 00:54:32,073
You know, the first phone call I made
after you proposed was to my office.

830
00:54:32,251 --> 00:54:34,583
To confirm my 10:00 meeting.

831
00:54:41,393 --> 00:54:44,362
It's really beautiful.

832
00:54:46,598 --> 00:54:48,566
For someone else.

833
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,567
Don't worry. It's...

834
00:54:58,577 --> 00:55:00,807
Me and Carmine will be fine. Won't we?

835
00:55:00,979 --> 00:55:03,004
Won't we, Carmine?

836
00:55:03,515 --> 00:55:04,846
Right, baby?

837
00:55:09,087 --> 00:55:11,817
Carmine, come. Come here.

838
00:55:15,590 --> 00:55:19,424
Okay, all right. Yeah. Okay...

839
00:55:33,709 --> 00:55:35,768
Did you even consider marrying me?

840
00:55:36,478 --> 00:55:38,537
Of course I did.

841
00:55:39,815 --> 00:55:45,117
But when you ask a girl to marry you,
do you want her to just consider it?

842
00:55:45,287 --> 00:55:47,915
Or do you want her to just know?

843
00:55:53,161 --> 00:55:56,187
<i>It's Romeo Midnight, back again.</i>

844
00:55:56,365 --> 00:56:00,199
<i>And if those topsy-turvy feelings
have got you twisted inside-out...</i>

845
00:56:00,369 --> 00:56:03,827
<i>...think of the poet Rumi,
who 800 years ago said:</i>

846
00:56:04,005 --> 00:56:08,339
<i>"All we really want
is love's confusing joy."</i>

847
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:10,444
<i>Amen, brother.</i>

848
00:56:10,846 --> 00:56:12,837
She was there, huh?

849
00:56:13,348 --> 00:56:15,043
Is that it?

850
00:56:17,853 --> 00:56:19,445
So this, you believe.

851
00:56:19,621 --> 00:56:22,419
You don't buy it
when she says yes to me...

852
00:56:22,691 --> 00:56:24,659
...but when she dumps me...

853
00:56:24,826 --> 00:56:27,420
...that you can wrap your head around.

854
00:56:27,596 --> 00:56:29,325
I had a feeling.

855
00:56:30,399 --> 00:56:32,959
- Excuse me?
- That it wasn't right, Reed.

856
00:56:33,135 --> 00:56:37,128
- Man, you know, an inkling.
- An inkling?

857
00:56:37,873 --> 00:56:42,503
You had an inkling,
and you kept it to yourself?

858
00:56:48,583 --> 00:56:51,984
You don't keep inklings to yourself.
You share them. You're like:

859
00:56:52,154 --> 00:56:53,621
"Hey, guy. I got an inkling...

860
00:56:53,789 --> 00:56:57,247
...you're headed for a fall here."
That's what friends do.

861
00:56:57,426 --> 00:57:00,691
That's common knowledge.
It's in the damn handbook.

862
00:57:01,930 --> 00:57:04,899
I'm sorry, Reed. You're right.

863
00:57:05,634 --> 00:57:07,727
I gotta stop Julia, don't I?

864
00:57:07,903 --> 00:57:11,498
If it's the damn handbook,
I think you better.

865
00:57:14,075 --> 00:57:15,099
Now, let's go.

866
00:57:21,483 --> 00:57:22,973
Next.

867
00:57:23,885 --> 00:57:26,718
I'm going to visit my boyfriend.
I'm surprising him.

868
00:57:26,888 --> 00:57:30,346
- Oh, yeah. Guys love surprises.
- Is that sarcasm?

869
00:57:30,525 --> 00:57:33,892
I surprised my husband once.
Now he's my ex-husband.

870
00:57:34,062 --> 00:57:36,929
- Oh, that sucks...
- Yes. Never touch security, ma'am.

871
00:57:37,098 --> 00:57:39,760
- Yes, ma'am. Copy that.
- Okay.

872
00:57:43,538 --> 00:57:44,664
- Next.
- Have a nice day.

873
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:46,432
You too, ma'am.

874
00:57:49,845 --> 00:57:53,611
I never had a inkling before.
I didn't know what to do with it.

875
00:57:53,782 --> 00:57:55,647
We gotta get to the airport.

876
00:57:55,817 --> 00:57:58,786
- Oh, shit. The flowers.
- Well, I'll deliver them. You go.

877
00:57:58,954 --> 00:58:00,945
I don't have a car. All I have is this van.

878
00:58:01,122 --> 00:58:04,751
My cousin Flaco lives nearby. He's got
a car you can borrow. It's a Chevy.

879
00:58:04,926 --> 00:58:06,223
Yeah?

880
00:58:06,394 --> 00:58:08,089
A hybrid.

881
00:58:25,647 --> 00:58:27,444
Right over there.

882
00:58:32,087 --> 00:58:36,114
Guy leaves. I said, "We can't take the dog."
He says, "You know, he'll be right back..."

883
00:58:36,291 --> 00:58:39,055
Hi. I need your first ticket...

884
00:58:39,227 --> 00:58:43,857
...out of terminal G to San Francisco.
- This counter for oversized items.

885
00:58:44,032 --> 00:58:47,001
Right. L... But you sell tickets.

886
00:58:47,168 --> 00:58:50,501
- This counter for oversized items.
- But you sell tickets, right?

887
00:58:50,672 --> 00:58:55,041
That counter is for oversized people
this counter is for oversized items, okay?

888
00:58:55,210 --> 00:58:57,371
Okay, here's my luggage.

889
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:00,543
Now it's a matched set.

890
00:59:00,715 --> 00:59:03,411
Buddy, I'm 52 and I'm wearing
a bright blue shirt to work.

891
00:59:03,585 --> 00:59:07,214
- Please don't make me madder than I am.
- I'm sorry.

892
00:59:10,792 --> 00:59:12,453
- There's this girl.
- Don't tell me...

893
00:59:12,627 --> 00:59:15,289
...that'll take the fun out of guessing.
Gonna be tough.

894
00:59:15,463 --> 00:59:18,660
There's a very pretty girl,
and she's about to get on a big airplane.

895
00:59:18,833 --> 00:59:22,360
And if you don't stop her,
she'll never know how you really feel.

896
00:59:23,038 --> 00:59:24,938
- Not exactly.
- What am I missing?

897
00:59:25,106 --> 00:59:28,132
If she gets on the plane,
she's gonna find out the hard way...

898
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:31,677
...that the guy
that she thinks she's in love with...

899
00:59:31,846 --> 00:59:35,543
...is a spineless, lying creep.
- That's no good.

900
00:59:35,717 --> 00:59:37,844
No, it is no good,
and I can't let that happen.

901
00:59:38,019 --> 00:59:42,183
Because this girl, she is great.
She's like...

902
00:59:43,291 --> 00:59:44,986
Like sunshine.

903
00:59:45,827 --> 00:59:48,022
Everything is better when she's there.

904
00:59:48,196 --> 00:59:53,725
I can't stand the idea of some jerk
hurting her. I just can't. I can't.

905
00:59:55,437 --> 00:59:56,802
Can you please be quiet...

906
00:59:56,972 --> 01:00:02,171
...so this nice young man
can sell me a ticket. Please?

907
01:00:02,711 --> 01:00:04,508
Take it easy.

908
01:00:04,679 --> 01:00:06,943
Here, this'll get you
to any gate in the place.

909
01:00:07,115 --> 01:00:09,811
- She's like sunshine, huh?
- Yeah.

910
01:00:09,985 --> 01:00:12,852
Well, in that case, it's on me.
Go on, get out of here.

911
01:00:13,021 --> 01:00:14,488
Thank you.

912
01:00:15,123 --> 01:00:16,590
Thank you.

913
01:00:39,481 --> 01:00:42,644
Right this way. Come on. Let me see.

914
01:00:44,753 --> 01:00:46,186
All right.

915
01:00:50,058 --> 01:00:51,923
Hey, sir. Sir.

916
01:00:52,093 --> 01:00:54,061
<i>- Just a moment, sir.
- Attention please.</i>

917
01:00:54,229 --> 01:00:55,924
<i>Flight 464 to San Francisco...</i>

918
01:00:56,097 --> 01:00:58,930
<i>...is now boarding at gate 13
in terminal G.</i>

919
01:01:01,136 --> 01:01:05,334
The... The man left his shoes.
Mister, the man forgot his shoes.

920
01:01:05,507 --> 01:01:06,838
We've got a Code Foxtrot.

921
01:01:07,008 --> 01:01:09,602
<i>- Excuse me. Excuse me!
- We've got a Code Foxtrot.</i>

922
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:13,479
Oh, on Mount Tam?

923
01:01:13,648 --> 01:01:16,344
Do you think? Because I heard
there's a little restaurant...

924
01:01:16,518 --> 01:01:19,817
He's a friend of mine. It's okay.
What are you doing?

925
01:01:19,988 --> 01:01:22,115
- Just...
- Where are your shoes? Are you okay?

926
01:01:22,290 --> 01:01:23,416
He's married.

927
01:01:24,793 --> 01:01:27,853
- What?
- Harrison. He's married.

928
01:01:28,930 --> 01:01:30,693
He was married, and now he's divorced.

929
01:01:30,865 --> 01:01:33,959
No. He's still married. Her name is Pamela.
They live in Brentwood.

930
01:01:34,135 --> 01:01:36,262
I know because I delivered flowers to her.

931
01:01:36,705 --> 01:01:39,071
I tried to tell you at the school.

932
01:01:39,507 --> 01:01:42,999
Did he say it was his current wife?
"I'm sending flowers to my current wife"?

933
01:01:43,178 --> 01:01:44,702
He didn't have to. I could tell.

934
01:01:44,879 --> 01:01:47,541
Like you could tell
that my old boyfriend Eddie was gay.

935
01:01:47,716 --> 01:01:50,378
- Eddie was gay.
- Eddie is married with two beautiful kids.

936
01:01:50,552 --> 01:01:53,282
- Eddie has a cat named Babs.
- You've tried to talk me...

937
01:01:53,455 --> 01:01:57,255
- ...out of every boyfriend since we've met.
- I'm telling you the truth. I promise.

938
01:01:57,425 --> 01:01:58,653
I'm going.

939
01:01:58,827 --> 01:02:01,193
No, hang on, hang on.
Come here, come here.

940
01:02:01,362 --> 01:02:03,455
Why, hello there. I'm with security.

941
01:02:03,631 --> 01:02:06,031
Do you think that Morley
and I belong together?

942
01:02:07,569 --> 01:02:10,504
- What does that have to do with anything?
- Just tell me. Do you?

943
01:02:10,672 --> 01:02:13,368
I don't know.
If you love her and if she loves you...

944
01:02:13,541 --> 01:02:16,169
- Answer the question.
- Fine.

945
01:02:17,946 --> 01:02:19,379
No.

946
01:02:20,615 --> 01:02:23,675
- Personally, I don't see it.
- That's what I'm doing here.

947
01:02:23,852 --> 01:02:26,650
Because apparently everyone
and their mother felt that way...

948
01:02:26,821 --> 01:02:28,755
...but nobody had the guts to tell me.

949
01:02:29,524 --> 01:02:32,789
And now, I'm left with some stupid ring
and an empty closet...

950
01:02:32,961 --> 01:02:37,898
...and an ache in my gut the size of Texas
because nobody told me.

951
01:02:38,933 --> 01:02:41,868
- She left you.
- Today.

952
01:02:44,906 --> 01:02:46,032
I'm sorry.

953
01:02:46,207 --> 01:02:51,270
This will serve as your final boarding call
for flight 464 to San Francisco.

954
01:03:03,358 --> 01:03:07,954
- I don't want this to happen to you.
- I'm sorry about Morley...

955
01:03:08,496 --> 01:03:10,259
...but I'm going to see my boyfriend.

956
01:03:10,865 --> 01:03:12,765
You know it's the truth.

957
01:03:17,238 --> 01:03:19,138
Sir, your shoes are still at security.

958
01:03:19,974 --> 01:03:21,771
We're not allowed to touch them.

959
01:03:21,943 --> 01:03:26,710
Sir, what kind of man takes his shoes off
and leave them off in public?

960
01:03:26,881 --> 01:03:29,816
Now, you know,
it's some nasty stuff on these floors, sir.

961
01:03:41,629 --> 01:03:43,096
Whoa.

962
01:03:45,733 --> 01:03:47,223
Sorry.

963
01:03:58,646 --> 01:04:02,309
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sure
you've noticed we're experiencing turbulence.</i>

964
01:04:02,483 --> 01:04:05,350
<i>Nothing to be concerned about
but the captain has turned on...</i>

965
01:04:05,519 --> 01:04:07,043
<i>...the seat belt sign for safety.</i>

966
01:04:07,221 --> 01:04:09,883
<i>Please return to your seats
until we pass through this...</i>

967
01:04:10,057 --> 01:04:12,890
<i>- ...which should be in just a few minutes.
- Yeah.</i>

968
01:04:13,227 --> 01:04:14,660
- Yeah.
- I'll just put it there.

969
01:04:14,828 --> 01:04:16,386
Watch your hands.

970
01:04:21,035 --> 01:04:22,593
You look very pretty.

971
01:04:23,437 --> 01:04:24,995
Thank you.

972
01:04:25,306 --> 01:04:26,330
- Are you nervous?
- Yes.

973
01:04:26,507 --> 01:04:29,772
No reason to be. The minute you walk
through that door nothing else...

974
01:04:29,944 --> 01:04:31,002
...is gonna matter.

975
01:04:31,579 --> 01:04:33,046
Thank you.

976
01:04:35,482 --> 01:04:37,973
Franklin rules!

977
01:04:39,486 --> 01:04:41,511
Hey, Edison, wanna warm up together?

978
01:04:41,689 --> 01:04:44,852
Yeah, Edison.
Warm up with your girlfriend.

979
01:04:45,025 --> 01:04:47,323
Grow up, Franklin.

980
01:04:48,429 --> 01:04:50,556
Are you gonna watch
Discovery Channel tonight?

981
01:04:50,731 --> 01:04:53,256
- It's about giraffes.
- No, I can't.

982
01:04:53,434 --> 01:04:55,334
I have to work at my mother's restaurant.

983
01:04:56,437 --> 01:04:58,564
- The one with the pointy towers?
- Yeah.

984
01:04:58,739 --> 01:05:00,468
I went there for your birthday party.

985
01:05:01,008 --> 01:05:04,239
It's a busy night for us. We have a wedding,
and a party for people...

986
01:05:04,411 --> 01:05:05,901
...who hate Valentine's Day.

987
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:09,474
- Why hate Valentine's Day?
- I don't know.

988
01:05:09,650 --> 01:05:12,915
We have it every year,
and it's all of Miss Fitzpatrick's friends.

989
01:05:13,087 --> 01:05:14,315
Really?

990
01:05:14,989 --> 01:05:17,082
Not in Franklin's house!

991
01:05:17,257 --> 01:05:19,350
Come on, the game's starting!

992
01:05:28,235 --> 01:05:31,170
- Edison, what the heck is wrong with you?
- I'm in love.

993
01:05:31,338 --> 01:05:34,068
So am I, but I can move my feet.

994
01:05:41,782 --> 01:05:44,945
Did you see it?
I went like this with my head.

995
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:49,078
I kicked the ball with my head!
Didn't you see it?

996
01:05:49,957 --> 01:05:54,758
Oh, I did see it, honey.
Mommy's so proud of you.

997
01:05:55,562 --> 01:05:57,621
Let's go find Daddy.

998
01:06:01,168 --> 01:06:04,262
I'm Kelvin Moore. Happy Valentine's Day.

999
01:06:04,438 --> 01:06:06,303
Welcome to the famous Hollywood Stars...

1000
01:06:06,473 --> 01:06:07,963
Don't you know who I am, huh?

1001
01:06:08,142 --> 01:06:10,770
- You think I wouldn't find you here?
- What are you doing?

1002
01:06:10,944 --> 01:06:13,003
- I'm trying to work.
- Look at this, everyone!

1003
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:15,648
This is not in... This isn't for pictures.

1004
01:06:15,816 --> 01:06:18,785
Miss. Oh, mother, what's going on?
Why so...?

1005
01:06:18,952 --> 01:06:20,886
"Cisco Martinez is a cheating rat."

1006
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:23,421
<i>She's loco.
I don't know what she's talking about.</i>

1007
01:06:23,590 --> 01:06:27,458
<i>- No, rata. You rata!
- Cisco! Cisco!</i>

1008
01:06:27,628 --> 01:06:30,563
- What are you doing? This is...
- Oh, she kneed him in the gonads.

1009
01:06:30,731 --> 01:06:32,892
My goodness, I feel for you.
The Dodger Dog.

1010
01:06:33,067 --> 01:06:34,500
- I'm okay.
- Sleeping with them?

1011
01:06:34,668 --> 01:06:36,260
Anyway, my name is Kelvin Moore.

1012
01:06:36,437 --> 01:06:38,530
Happy Valentine's Day.
KVLA, channel 13.

1013
01:06:40,107 --> 01:06:41,597
We done?

1014
01:06:42,843 --> 01:06:45,403
Got a text. Sean Jackson
is calling a press conference.

1015
01:06:45,579 --> 01:06:48,309
This could be my exclusive, okay?
Listen, keep filming.

1016
01:06:48,482 --> 01:06:51,474
All right, do some B-roll
or something like that, all right?

1017
01:06:51,952 --> 01:06:53,749
No worries, boss.

1018
01:06:55,823 --> 01:06:57,814
It's my day.

1019
01:06:58,792 --> 01:07:01,693
Hey, listen, I need to be able
to talk to Kara for two seconds.

1020
01:07:01,862 --> 01:07:05,195
I already gave you everything on the
press conference, so we are good.

1021
01:07:05,365 --> 01:07:09,324
I'm trying to do something special.
Look at the profile. I'm from KVLA.

1022
01:07:09,503 --> 01:07:11,937
- The number two sports guy.
- On my way to number one.

1023
01:07:12,106 --> 01:07:14,540
I wanted to ask her one question
about Sean Jackson.

1024
01:07:14,708 --> 01:07:17,700
I need to be able to ask Sean Jackson
one question on camera.

1025
01:07:17,878 --> 01:07:19,971
She's on a conference call,
she's very busy.

1026
01:07:20,147 --> 01:07:21,808
- I don't know if I can...
- My bladder.

1027
01:07:21,982 --> 01:07:25,008
I gotta use the bathroom. Got a bathroom?
Oh, I dropped my notes.

1028
01:07:25,185 --> 01:07:28,211
- No. You can't just barge into an... Kara.
- Kara.

1029
01:07:28,388 --> 01:07:30,618
- Damn.
- Oh, Kara. Are you okay?

1030
01:07:30,791 --> 01:07:33,988
- Oh, do I look okay?
- Should we call a doctor?

1031
01:07:34,161 --> 01:07:35,526
No, it's this day.

1032
01:07:35,696 --> 01:07:38,130
Christmas, New Year's, Fourth of July,
she's fine.

1033
01:07:38,298 --> 01:07:42,200
- Valentine's Day, not so good.
- What are you doing tonight, Kelvin?

1034
01:07:43,837 --> 01:07:47,830
I'm actually here about the Sean Jackson
interview, but we could talk.

1035
01:07:48,008 --> 01:07:52,468
Relax, I'm not asking you out.
I'm just curious.

1036
01:07:52,646 --> 01:07:57,879
How are you spending
this happiest of all days?

1037
01:07:58,452 --> 01:08:00,647
- Let me just...
- You don't wanna call somebody?

1038
01:08:00,821 --> 01:08:03,016
I just wanna know if, in fact...

1039
01:08:03,190 --> 01:08:07,684
...I am the only person
on the whole freaking planet...

1040
01:08:07,861 --> 01:08:13,163
...who is completely
and 100-percent alone on Valentine's Day.

1041
01:08:14,101 --> 01:08:15,398
I asked you a question.

1042
01:08:16,136 --> 01:08:18,161
Yeah. I'm working.

1043
01:08:18,739 --> 01:08:21,105
I got three telecasts: 9, 10, and 11:00.

1044
01:08:21,275 --> 01:08:25,541
Usually, I do two, but people want it off,
so I'm happy to cover for them on this day.

1045
01:08:25,979 --> 01:08:28,209
You don't like to go out
on Valentine's Day?

1046
01:08:28,382 --> 01:08:30,748
- I hate it.
- Me too.

1047
01:08:31,251 --> 01:08:34,482
It's my fault I'm alone.
I'm neurotic to the nth degree.

1048
01:08:34,655 --> 01:08:36,418
I don't have time to work on myself...

1049
01:08:36,590 --> 01:08:39,081
...because I'm too busy
fixing everyone else.

1050
01:08:39,259 --> 01:08:41,819
- Right.
- My closest relationship...

1051
01:08:41,995 --> 01:08:43,690
...is with my BlackBerry.

1052
01:08:43,864 --> 01:08:45,923
- Right.
- Thank God it vibrates.

1053
01:08:46,099 --> 01:08:47,566
- Oh, no.
- But do you know...

1054
01:08:47,734 --> 01:08:49,998
...who has always been there for me?
- Who's that?

1055
01:08:50,170 --> 01:08:54,106
- My best friend: Candy.
- There's somebody.

1056
01:08:54,641 --> 01:08:57,269
I cannot get enough.
And I know it's bad...

1057
01:08:57,444 --> 01:08:58,672
- Kara.
...but I need it.

1058
01:08:58,846 --> 01:09:01,644
I need it, and there is not a shortage
on Valentine's Day.

1059
01:09:01,815 --> 01:09:03,544
And that is my future.

1060
01:09:03,717 --> 01:09:07,244
I'll be a Ionely old lady
with rotting teeth.

1061
01:09:07,421 --> 01:09:10,390
- No, no, no. No, you're not.
- And a chocolate mustache.

1062
01:09:15,896 --> 01:09:18,364
Okay, maybe you should try some tofu
or something.

1063
01:09:18,532 --> 01:09:21,968
Okay. It'll balance out your emotions.

1064
01:09:22,169 --> 01:09:24,364
I don't want a mustache.

1065
01:09:25,572 --> 01:09:27,164
You'll look hot with a mustache.

1066
01:09:27,808 --> 01:09:30,606
Or without it. It doesn't matter.

1067
01:09:39,186 --> 01:09:43,145
- You can let go of me now.
- Yeah, I should.

1068
01:09:43,323 --> 01:09:45,757
- Well, I guess we're done here.
- All right.

1069
01:09:45,926 --> 01:09:47,188
You can check with Heather.

1070
01:09:47,361 --> 01:09:49,989
- She'll validate your parking.
- You have a blessed day.

1071
01:09:52,499 --> 01:09:54,126
<i>On your mark.</i>

1072
01:09:54,301 --> 01:09:55,461
Get set.

1073
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:02,868
I'm Greg Gilkins at
my old high school, Henderson High...

1074
01:10:03,043 --> 01:10:04,840
...and today's subject: Young love.

1075
01:10:05,012 --> 01:10:08,971
I'm joined by Felicia, whose boyfriend,
Willy, will be joining us shortly.

1076
01:10:09,149 --> 01:10:12,550
- Felicia, if he's the star athlete, you are...?
- Not the cheerleader.

1077
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:15,950
- I'm on the dance team.
- Maybe you could show us a little bit.

1078
01:10:16,123 --> 01:10:17,988
Five, six, seven, eight.

1079
01:10:24,331 --> 01:10:26,390
Don't hurt yourself.

1080
01:10:26,566 --> 01:10:28,397
- Yes.
- I haven't seen moves like that...

1081
01:10:28,568 --> 01:10:31,867
...since the '94 Northridge quake.
You guys are...

1082
01:10:35,108 --> 01:10:37,576
How do you feel about each other
this Valentine's Day?

1083
01:10:37,744 --> 01:10:40,338
- Oh, my gosh. I totally love him.
- I'm crazy about her.

1084
01:10:40,514 --> 01:10:42,982
Willy, what is it about her
that makes you so happy?

1085
01:10:43,150 --> 01:10:46,278
Well, she's beautiful,
she makes me laugh...

1086
01:10:46,453 --> 01:10:48,387
- ...and she does my geometry.
- Bonus.

1087
01:10:48,555 --> 01:10:49,579
- Yep.
- And, Felicia...

1088
01:10:49,756 --> 01:10:51,656
...what is it about Willy that's so cool?

1089
01:10:51,825 --> 01:10:55,625
What, besides the fact that he's totally hot?
He's an amazing athlete.

1090
01:10:55,796 --> 01:10:57,923
Go show them, babe.
Go show them, go show them.

1091
01:10:58,098 --> 01:11:00,032
He's so good.

1092
01:11:03,603 --> 01:11:08,040
How about this? I cook her dinner and then
serve it to her in front of a fireplace.

1093
01:11:08,208 --> 01:11:10,676
- That says romance.
- That says cheap-o.

1094
01:11:10,844 --> 01:11:11,868
Okay, not a problem.

1095
01:11:12,045 --> 01:11:14,673
I got her tickets to the movie
at the Hollywood Cemetery.

1096
01:11:14,848 --> 01:11:17,180
Oh, yeah. Chicks love the cemetery...

1097
01:11:17,351 --> 01:11:20,252
- ...on Valentine's Day.
- Don't you think you should get a gift?

1098
01:11:20,420 --> 01:11:24,117
Gift? I'm supposed to get her a Prius?
We've been dating for like two weeks.

1099
01:11:24,858 --> 01:11:26,382
Is there a two-week gift?

1100
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:28,960
If you want there to be a third week
there is.

1101
01:11:29,129 --> 01:11:31,723
- So how did you guys meet?
- It's really funny, actually.

1102
01:11:31,898 --> 01:11:33,490
Like, I was not into him at first.

1103
01:11:33,667 --> 01:11:36,067
He used to shoot spit wads at me
in Spanish class...

1104
01:11:36,236 --> 01:11:37,863
...which is, like, so junior high.

1105
01:11:38,805 --> 01:11:41,740
But then one night I was brushing out
my hair when I got home...

1106
01:11:41,908 --> 01:11:44,900
...and I found this spit wad,
but it was really a note.

1107
01:11:45,078 --> 01:11:48,912
And it said, "What's up?"
And I was like, "That is so cute."

1108
01:11:49,082 --> 01:11:50,106
And then I liked him.

1109
01:11:57,624 --> 01:12:01,321
Oh, my God. Baby, are you okay?
Walk it off, baby. Just walk it off.

1110
01:12:02,429 --> 01:12:04,989
You're still hot, baby. You're still hot.

1111
01:12:05,165 --> 01:12:08,191
- He rolled out of that like a ninja.
- He's usually good at those.

1112
01:12:08,368 --> 01:12:10,802
He's quite the athlete,
you're quite the dancer, huh?

1113
01:12:10,971 --> 01:12:14,907
- Five, six, seven, eight!
- No, I think... I think we're okay.

1114
01:12:15,075 --> 01:12:17,441
Oh, we haven't seen that one.

1115
01:12:17,778 --> 01:12:20,246
- Way to go. She tell you the spit-wad story?
- She did.

1116
01:12:20,414 --> 01:12:22,382
- Yeah, she's mushy like that.
- You like it.

1117
01:12:22,549 --> 01:12:24,744
- I know.
- Oh, I miss high school.

1118
01:12:25,719 --> 01:12:28,620
There you have it, young love.
Full of promise, full of hope...

1119
01:12:28,789 --> 01:12:31,883
...ignorant of reality. From Henderson High
on Valentine's Day, I'm Greg Gilkins.

1120
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:35,052
Okay.

1121
01:12:35,228 --> 01:12:38,163
Sorry, Mr. E., but they can't get your
flowers delivered today...

1122
01:12:38,331 --> 01:12:42,768
- ...but they'll figure it out tomorrow.
- No, it has to be today. It has to.

1123
01:12:43,637 --> 01:12:47,073
Oh, just let him go.
Let him go, let him go, let him go.

1124
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:51,336
I'll tell you, today's a lot of pressure for
anyone, let alone a little kid. Come on.

1125
01:12:52,112 --> 01:12:55,548
Tell me about it. I haven't been having
the best day myself.

1126
01:12:59,352 --> 01:13:01,616
Is everything okay with Alex?

1127
01:13:01,788 --> 01:13:04,814
- Not really.
- Uh-oh. What happened?

1128
01:13:06,326 --> 01:13:09,727
Alex and I were supposed to...

1129
01:13:10,097 --> 01:13:11,121
...have sex today.

1130
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:15,995
For the first time. For both of us.

1131
01:13:17,170 --> 01:13:20,037
I wanted it to be magical,
and I'm realizing that...

1132
01:13:20,207 --> 01:13:22,732
...it's hard to plan something
to be magical, you know?

1133
01:13:22,909 --> 01:13:26,811
- Yes, that it is.
- Love can't be planned.

1134
01:13:26,980 --> 01:13:29,881
It's not love she is talking about, Edgar.
It is sex.

1135
01:13:30,050 --> 01:13:31,312
He's going to Stanford.

1136
01:13:31,485 --> 01:13:35,080
I'm going to Yale.
And it's just hit me recently that...

1137
01:13:35,255 --> 01:13:37,382
...it's gonna be really hard
to stay together.

1138
01:13:37,557 --> 01:13:41,459
So I guess I thought that if we had
this amazing thing connecting us...

1139
01:13:41,628 --> 01:13:44,324
...it'd make it easier, somehow,
but I don't know...

1140
01:13:44,498 --> 01:13:47,763
...hearing myself say it out loud,
it all sounds really stupid.

1141
01:13:47,934 --> 01:13:51,768
And it's not like I'm gonna sleep with
one person for the rest of my life, right?

1142
01:13:51,938 --> 01:13:53,838
I mean, that's just crazy. Who does that?

1143
01:13:54,007 --> 01:13:58,671
- Oh, crazy people like us. We did.
- No.

1144
01:14:00,447 --> 01:14:04,781
- That's amazing.
- Well, granted, it was a different time...

1145
01:14:04,951 --> 01:14:08,580
...and people weren't as promiscuous
as they are now.

1146
01:14:08,755 --> 01:14:12,088
And there were times we spent
long periods apart, but we managed.

1147
01:14:12,259 --> 01:14:16,161
I'm not saying it was easy
or suggesting it for you.

1148
01:14:16,329 --> 01:14:18,524
Just saying it's possible.

1149
01:14:18,698 --> 01:14:22,259
And actually, we're gonna renew our vows
this spring, right?

1150
01:14:27,007 --> 01:14:30,238
- Would you excuse us a minute?
- Yeah. I'm gonna take this.

1151
01:14:30,944 --> 01:14:35,176
Hey. No, I'm just at Edgar and Estelle's.
What are you doing?

1152
01:14:37,884 --> 01:14:41,684
Alex, I gotta tell you something.

1153
01:14:41,855 --> 01:14:43,880
I don't know if today's the day.

1154
01:14:44,057 --> 01:14:46,491
I want it to be special,
you want it to be special...

1155
01:14:46,660 --> 01:14:51,063
...and, you know, we tried
to make it special, but, you know...

1156
01:14:51,631 --> 01:14:54,862
Do you wanna go back there and see
my mom after what happened earlier?

1157
01:14:55,035 --> 01:14:56,434
I don't think so.

1158
01:14:59,072 --> 01:15:02,303
All right, well, okay.

1159
01:15:02,475 --> 01:15:03,942
Um...

1160
01:15:04,110 --> 01:15:06,601
You know what, Alex, sorry.
I need to call you back.

1161
01:15:06,780 --> 01:15:08,748
I have to go. I'll call you later. Bye.

1162
01:15:13,153 --> 01:15:14,177
Edison!

1163
01:15:32,339 --> 01:15:36,708
Remember when you went away
to Florida to build the apartments?

1164
01:15:36,877 --> 01:15:39,710
You remember that.
And you were gone a very long time.

1165
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:41,142
Yes.

1166
01:15:41,848 --> 01:15:44,146
You were gone so long.

1167
01:15:44,484 --> 01:15:46,145
I was so Ionely.

1168
01:15:47,654 --> 01:15:49,451
And...

1169
01:15:49,623 --> 01:15:54,993
Well, Joey came over. It was my birthday,
and he brought flowers, and...

1170
01:15:55,161 --> 01:15:57,994
- I sent you flowers, hon.
- Yes, you did.

1171
01:15:58,164 --> 01:16:00,291
And champagne.

1172
01:16:00,467 --> 01:16:02,458
Joey? Wait a minute.

1173
01:16:02,636 --> 01:16:04,399
- Joey Keenan?
- Yes.

1174
01:16:04,571 --> 01:16:06,835
- My business partner.
- That's right.

1175
01:16:08,508 --> 01:16:11,306
And we sat and we talked
and we had dinner, and we...

1176
01:16:12,879 --> 01:16:14,710
And then...

1177
01:16:16,583 --> 01:16:19,416
It wasn't anything at first. And...

1178
01:16:19,586 --> 01:16:23,989
- You had an affair.
- Yes. But it didn't last long, Edgar.

1179
01:16:24,157 --> 01:16:27,422
Didn't last long,
and we regretted it very much.

1180
01:16:27,594 --> 01:16:29,585
I'm so sorry.

1181
01:16:35,235 --> 01:16:39,171
- You're the only man I've ever loved.
- Then why tell me now?

1182
01:16:39,339 --> 01:16:42,831
It's been bothering me.
Our vows and everything.

1183
01:16:43,009 --> 01:16:45,273
And I wanted to tell you the truth.

1184
01:16:45,912 --> 01:16:47,937
The truth?

1185
01:16:50,283 --> 01:16:52,615
Well, unfortunately, Estelle...

1186
01:16:52,786 --> 01:16:56,313
...the truth makes everything else
seem like a lie.

1187
01:16:57,924 --> 01:16:59,585
I'm sorry.

1188
01:17:09,869 --> 01:17:11,803
<i>Why do you hate heart-shaped candy?</i>

1189
01:17:11,972 --> 01:17:17,069
I think it's because it reminds me that this
is Valentine's Day, and I'm recently single.

1190
01:17:17,344 --> 01:17:19,175
- We weren't on the same page.
- Sorry.

1191
01:17:19,346 --> 01:17:22,611
- It's okay. It's over.
- Nothing to be done?

1192
01:17:22,782 --> 01:17:25,774
No, no. I've seen the enemy
and the enemy is me.

1193
01:17:25,952 --> 01:17:28,648
You could go for the stewardess.
She seems to like you.

1194
01:17:29,155 --> 01:17:31,146
I think she likes everybody,
that's her job.

1195
01:17:31,324 --> 01:17:33,884
She looks over here every 5 seconds.

1196
01:17:34,060 --> 01:17:35,925
- No.
- Ready?

1197
01:17:36,096 --> 01:17:38,394
- Five, four, three...
- You wanna bet on it?

1198
01:17:38,565 --> 01:17:41,056
- I'll bet you a bag of pretzels.
- Okay.

1199
01:17:41,234 --> 01:17:43,327
Five, four, three, two...

1200
01:17:43,503 --> 01:17:46,597
- Oh, there it is.
- Okay. All right, that was a coincidence.

1201
01:17:46,773 --> 01:17:49,435
- Five, four, three...
- Stop it. Stop it.

1202
01:17:49,609 --> 01:17:52,942
- Looked on three. She's gonna come here.
- Excuse me.

1203
01:17:53,113 --> 01:17:56,605
- Can I get you anything?
- A bag of pretzels, please.

1204
01:17:57,650 --> 01:17:59,379
Two, actually.

1205
01:18:13,333 --> 01:18:17,463
Thank you for the flowers, Mr. Troken.
Ready for your sponge bath?

1206
01:18:17,637 --> 01:18:19,605
Yes, please.

1207
01:18:28,581 --> 01:18:31,243
Hi, excuse me. Hi.

1208
01:18:31,418 --> 01:18:33,443
Could I ask you a question?

1209
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:36,418
I'm looking for Dr. Copeland.
Is he here tonight?

1210
01:18:36,589 --> 01:18:40,355
- Not tonight, no.
- Sorry, Dr. Harrison Copeland.

1211
01:18:40,527 --> 01:18:42,290
Not tonight.

1212
01:18:42,996 --> 01:18:47,660
- Could you tell me where I could find him?
- Are you a patient? Is something wrong?

1213
01:18:53,039 --> 01:18:57,135
Look, can I ask you a question,
just woman to woman?

1214
01:18:58,511 --> 01:19:00,069
Okay.

1215
01:19:04,084 --> 01:19:06,314
Is Dr. Copeland married?

1216
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:08,847
Not divorced or not separated...

1217
01:19:09,022 --> 01:19:12,651
...just full-on married
to a woman named Pamela?

1218
01:19:16,463 --> 01:19:19,227
They just celebrated
their 15th anniversary.

1219
01:19:21,301 --> 01:19:22,996
Cardiology Center.

1220
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:30,032
Los Angeles Hospital, may I help you?

1221
01:19:31,744 --> 01:19:34,713
Bistro Garden, early seating.

1222
01:19:43,957 --> 01:19:46,187
Kara, I'm still here. I'm in L.A.

1223
01:19:46,359 --> 01:19:48,350
I have a lot to tell you. Give me a call.

1224
01:19:49,596 --> 01:19:52,258
May I have your attention, please?
I'm Sean's publicist...

1225
01:19:52,432 --> 01:19:55,629
...and recently there has been a lot of
speculation about his future.

1226
01:19:55,802 --> 01:19:59,966
And rather than keep you all in suspense,
he will make a brief statement at this time.

1227
01:20:03,276 --> 01:20:05,904
- Hey, boss. Sorry, elevator took a year.
- Cleaning up?

1228
01:20:06,079 --> 01:20:07,637
- I'm trying to be you.
- All right.

1229
01:20:07,814 --> 01:20:10,078
First off, I'd like to thank everyone
for coming.

1230
01:20:10,250 --> 01:20:13,981
I know it's Valentine's Day and you might
have other plans, so I'll be quick.

1231
01:20:14,154 --> 01:20:15,712
<i>The clich?..</i>

1232
01:20:15,889 --> 01:20:19,052
<i>...when someone's retiring
who doesn't wanna retire...</i>

1233
01:20:19,225 --> 01:20:23,025
...is to say that it's because they wanna
spend more time with their family.

1234
01:20:23,196 --> 01:20:28,190
I don't have a family,
and with everything football has given me...

1235
01:20:28,635 --> 01:20:32,196
...the biggest thing it's taken away is that.

1236
01:20:32,372 --> 01:20:35,739
Because of who I am...

1237
01:20:36,042 --> 01:20:37,168
...because of my job...

1238
01:20:37,343 --> 01:20:40,938
...I haven't been able to live the life
I want to.

1239
01:20:41,114 --> 01:20:44,948
With that in mind, I'll just say the thing
I came here to say.

1240
01:20:46,319 --> 01:20:47,479
I'm gay.

1241
01:20:50,223 --> 01:20:51,247
I knew it!

1242
01:20:51,424 --> 01:20:53,255
- Any questions?
- Are you kidding me?

1243
01:20:53,426 --> 01:20:56,657
And be cool, because I'm not above
kicking anybody's ass.

1244
01:20:56,829 --> 01:20:58,797
Sean, you for real?

1245
01:20:59,432 --> 01:21:02,128
Uh, first question.

1246
01:21:02,735 --> 01:21:04,965
Sean, come on, help me out.

1247
01:21:05,738 --> 01:21:07,103
Kelvin Moore, KVLA.

1248
01:21:07,874 --> 01:21:10,866
Sean, I'm confused here.
Are you saying that you're retiring?

1249
01:21:11,044 --> 01:21:13,478
Oh, right, that.

1250
01:21:14,614 --> 01:21:18,380
No, Kelvin. No, I'm not retiring.

1251
01:21:18,718 --> 01:21:21,380
I'm gay, and I'm gonna play.

1252
01:21:32,498 --> 01:21:35,695
Pick up the phone, Estelle. Edgar.

1253
01:21:39,339 --> 01:21:41,637
- Rosato martini with soda, table six.
- You got it.

1254
01:21:41,808 --> 01:21:46,404
<i>I'm not really a waitress, I'm an actress.
I just did a day on Days of Our Lives.</i>

1255
01:21:47,213 --> 01:21:50,341
- Happy Valentine's Day.
- Happy Valentine's to you.

1256
01:21:50,516 --> 01:21:52,313
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

1257
01:21:54,754 --> 01:21:56,847
- Thank you.
- Olivia's gonna need braces.

1258
01:21:57,023 --> 01:21:58,081
Well, that makes sense.

1259
01:21:58,258 --> 01:22:00,590
- I had them, you had them.
- I know.

1260
01:22:03,062 --> 01:22:04,689
Bistro Gardens restaurant.

1261
01:22:05,465 --> 01:22:06,489
Good evening.

1262
01:22:09,602 --> 01:22:11,399
- Hi.
- Harrison?

1263
01:22:11,571 --> 01:22:13,732
- Are you okay?
- Excuse me. Excuse...

1264
01:22:13,906 --> 01:22:15,874
- You all right, sir?
- You okay?

1265
01:22:16,042 --> 01:22:19,409
Great. Well, my name is Julia,
and I'm gonna be your server tonight.

1266
01:22:19,579 --> 01:22:21,570
Why don't I get started
with a few specials?

1267
01:22:21,748 --> 01:22:23,079
Yes, please.

1268
01:22:23,249 --> 01:22:27,549
Tonight the chef is featuring a dish
that he likes to call the lying, stinking pig.

1269
01:22:28,254 --> 01:22:34,124
- You're kidding. How is that cooked?
- He starts by cutting off the pig's testicles...

1270
01:22:34,294 --> 01:22:37,855
...and he chops them up really finely,
teeny, tiny pieces.

1271
01:22:38,031 --> 01:22:42,058
And then he takes those testicles,
and he pulverizes them...

1272
01:22:42,235 --> 01:22:44,897
...and adds in a little arugula,
some sage...

1273
01:22:45,071 --> 01:22:47,869
...feta cheese, and shoves the mixture...

1274
01:22:48,041 --> 01:22:50,066
...back up the pig's...

1275
01:22:50,243 --> 01:22:52,404
Well, for lack of a better word, ass.

1276
01:22:54,414 --> 01:22:58,248
- Really?
- Yeah. Then he cuts out the heart...

1277
01:22:58,418 --> 01:23:00,943
...the cold, useless, tiny, little heart...

1278
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:05,216
<i>...then fillets it on either side
and it's a nice amuse-bouche.</i>

1279
01:23:07,026 --> 01:23:09,859
- I'll have the salmon.
- Good choice.

1280
01:23:10,029 --> 01:23:11,724
For you, sir?

1281
01:23:11,898 --> 01:23:14,594
I'm not... I don't... I don't know.

1282
01:23:14,767 --> 01:23:18,533
Oh, just so you know,
the heart of the pig...

1283
01:23:18,705 --> 01:23:20,832
...little something like this.

1284
01:23:26,746 --> 01:23:27,770
Did we get a toy?

1285
01:23:28,481 --> 01:23:32,975
Maybe I'll give you a little time
to juggle the choices, sir.

1286
01:23:42,095 --> 01:23:43,790
Nicely done.

1287
01:23:43,963 --> 01:23:47,023
Miss Fitzpatrick, my son Franklin
really loves your class.

1288
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:50,601
- Oh, he's got a great imagination.
- Yeah.

1289
01:23:50,937 --> 01:23:52,529
So I guess we'll charge these to...

1290
01:23:52,705 --> 01:23:55,367
- Oh, charge these to my friend over there.
- I figured.

1291
01:23:55,541 --> 01:23:57,600
I put in some lobster tails
and a cheesecake.

1292
01:23:58,644 --> 01:24:00,475
Thank you, Amos.

1293
01:24:15,995 --> 01:24:17,963
And then maybe these?

1294
01:24:18,798 --> 01:24:21,665
Put that ticket right...
Put it where you're looking. Yep.

1295
01:24:21,834 --> 01:24:25,793
Yep. Great. Thank you.
Now let me take that thing.

1296
01:24:25,972 --> 01:24:28,532
Thank you very much. Appreciate it.

1297
01:24:30,476 --> 01:24:32,876
Oh, crap. Just go.

1298
01:24:33,045 --> 01:24:36,606
Golden Kadahi, best Indian restaurant
in Los Angeles. How may I help you?

1299
01:24:37,450 --> 01:24:40,942
Hi. This is Rehka speaking.

1300
01:24:47,193 --> 01:24:50,526
- Hey, Liz.
- Oh, hi.

1301
01:24:52,698 --> 01:24:53,824
- Hey.
- Hey.

1302
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,491
I made it. Cannot even believe it.

1303
01:24:56,669 --> 01:24:58,364
- Oh, sorry.
- Sorry.

1304
01:24:58,538 --> 01:25:00,665
- Hi.
- Sorry.

1305
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:02,933
Wow, Liz, you look beautiful.

1306
01:25:03,109 --> 01:25:06,840
Thank you. Paula's indefinite trip
out of the office coincided very nicely...

1307
01:25:07,013 --> 01:25:10,244
...with my "haul ass home
and throw on something festive" plan, so...

1308
01:25:10,416 --> 01:25:11,440
You look wonderful.

1309
01:25:14,921 --> 01:25:16,183
Hi.

1310
01:25:16,355 --> 01:25:17,379
- So...
- I was think...

1311
01:25:17,557 --> 01:25:20,117
- What? Did you want...?
- Sorry. Go ahead. No, you first.

1312
01:25:20,293 --> 01:25:21,521
- Please. You should.
- You...

1313
01:25:21,694 --> 01:25:24,254
Oh, okay.
You don't wanna be an agent, do you?

1314
01:25:24,430 --> 01:25:26,398
No, but I may need an agent...

1315
01:25:26,566 --> 01:25:31,435
...so I figure might as well
learn the business while I'm agentless.

1316
01:25:31,604 --> 01:25:34,573
Good evening, sir, ma'am.
Welcome to The Blvd.

1317
01:25:34,740 --> 01:25:37,072
Would you like the four-course
Sweetheart's Menu...

1318
01:25:37,243 --> 01:25:40,906
- ...or the eight-course Eternal Love?
- Whoa, slow down.

1319
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:44,072
Is there, like, a one-course
"Only Been Dating For Two Weeks...

1320
01:25:44,250 --> 01:25:46,718
...But It Looks Promising" option?

1321
01:25:47,453 --> 01:25:49,250
Because...

1322
01:25:49,422 --> 01:25:50,821
I'm kidding.

1323
01:25:50,990 --> 01:25:54,391
I realize that, sir.
I'll come back when you're serious.

1324
01:25:56,128 --> 01:25:58,528
He's your biggest fan.

1325
01:25:58,865 --> 01:26:00,662
Hello? That's my water.

1326
01:26:01,634 --> 01:26:04,831
You know, I didn't touch mine,
so why don't you go ahead and have it?

1327
01:26:05,004 --> 01:26:06,699
Happy Valentine's Day.

1328
01:26:06,873 --> 01:26:08,238
Well, same to you.

1329
01:26:08,407 --> 01:26:09,738
- Charlie!
- What?

1330
01:26:09,909 --> 01:26:11,809
She said happy Valentine's Day.

1331
01:26:11,978 --> 01:26:13,172
- Look...
- I can't talk now?

1332
01:26:13,346 --> 01:26:15,075
I'm sorry this place is such a zoo.

1333
01:26:15,248 --> 01:26:19,082
It's fine. I mean, they're fighting,
they're mating, and I'm in the zoo with you.

1334
01:26:23,256 --> 01:26:24,689
God.

1335
01:26:26,893 --> 01:26:30,488
Jason, um, I really like you...

1336
01:26:30,663 --> 01:26:33,860
...and I was... I just...

1337
01:26:34,667 --> 01:26:37,830
I'm just wondering how you feel...

1338
01:26:38,271 --> 01:26:39,932
...about the idea of...

1339
01:26:42,441 --> 01:26:44,966
Oh, God. I've gotta...
I'm gonna take this outside.

1340
01:26:45,144 --> 01:26:48,045
- Sure, sure, sure. Yeah, yeah. Go. Yeah.
- I'm sorry. Thank you.

1341
01:26:48,214 --> 01:26:49,340
Go ahead.

1342
01:26:49,515 --> 01:26:52,075
- Be right back.
- Sure.

1343
01:26:58,991 --> 01:27:01,118
All right, Stanley, listen to me.

1344
01:27:01,294 --> 01:27:04,058
We're gonna make this hard,
and we're gonna make this fast.

1345
01:27:04,230 --> 01:27:06,698
Yes, we can get you
two adjoining rooms.

1346
01:27:06,866 --> 01:27:09,630
Yes. But with the door open,
you still have to pay for both.

1347
01:27:09,802 --> 01:27:11,827
Okay. Bye-bye now. Hi.

1348
01:27:12,004 --> 01:27:14,029
Hi. Welcome to the Beverly Wilshire.

1349
01:27:14,206 --> 01:27:15,468
- How many checking in?
- Two.

1350
01:27:15,641 --> 01:27:16,665
- Two?
- I mean one.

1351
01:27:16,842 --> 01:27:20,175
Well, technically, it's two.
One person and Carmine, my dog.

1352
01:27:20,346 --> 01:27:22,871
A person and a dog.
Okay, that would be our pleasure.

1353
01:27:23,049 --> 01:27:24,073
Oh, okay.

1354
01:27:24,250 --> 01:27:26,411
Oh, and by the way,
happy Valentine's Day.

1355
01:27:27,453 --> 01:27:29,045
You too.

1356
01:27:30,656 --> 01:27:33,591
And Julia's not even in love
with that guy.

1357
01:27:34,193 --> 01:27:35,285
How do you know that?

1358
01:27:35,461 --> 01:27:39,864
She was too calm about the whole thing.
I mean, always under control.

1359
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:41,294
Listen:

1360
01:27:41,467 --> 01:27:45,597
"The way of love is
not a subtle argument.

1361
01:27:45,771 --> 01:27:49,605
The door there is devastation."
The master.

1362
01:27:49,775 --> 01:27:52,710
So according to Rumi,
love has to be devastating?

1363
01:27:52,878 --> 01:27:57,372
Listen. You don't step into love, my friend,
you fall in. Head over heels.

1364
01:27:57,550 --> 01:28:02,010
You ever seen somebody fall
head over heels in love for real, Reed?

1365
01:28:02,188 --> 01:28:05,180
It's ugly, bro. Toxic, septic.

1366
01:28:05,358 --> 01:28:08,020
Come on, boss. Still got a few hours left.

1367
01:28:08,194 --> 01:28:11,391
Make something happen
with somebody someplace.

1368
01:28:11,564 --> 01:28:12,929
- Cookie?
- I'm good.

1369
01:28:13,099 --> 01:28:15,863
Day's not over yet, man. Give me some.

1370
01:28:16,469 --> 01:28:20,030
Hey, tell me something.
How'd you and your wife get it so right?

1371
01:28:20,973 --> 01:28:23,305
That's easy. I married my best friend.

1372
01:28:25,144 --> 01:28:26,634
Thought I was your best friend.

1373
01:28:26,812 --> 01:28:29,906
Yeah, you're my man. That's my lady.

1374
01:28:30,616 --> 01:28:33,107
- Night.
- Good night.

1375
01:28:33,586 --> 01:28:36,248
- Go give your wife those cookies, huh?
- Best for the best.

1376
01:28:36,422 --> 01:28:39,983
Yeah. Best for the best.

1377
01:29:04,617 --> 01:29:07,586
- Kate. Hey, have a great trip.
- Thanks. Nice meeting you.

1378
01:29:07,753 --> 01:29:09,414
Yeah.

1379
01:29:09,588 --> 01:29:11,783
- This is my taxi!
- No, no, I been waiting.

1380
01:29:11,957 --> 01:29:14,619
- I been waiting 45 minutes.
- Be a little patient, folks.

1381
01:29:18,698 --> 01:29:20,689
- Hey, Redmond.
- Welcome back, Mr. Wilson.

1382
01:29:20,866 --> 01:29:22,993
- Did you have to wait long?
- Not long at all.

1383
01:29:23,169 --> 01:29:25,228
- Check any bags?
- No.

1384
01:29:28,974 --> 01:29:31,067
They're right through there.

1385
01:29:39,852 --> 01:29:41,114
May I help you, captain?

1386
01:29:42,188 --> 01:29:43,655
Thank you.

1387
01:29:44,757 --> 01:29:45,781
You okay?

1388
01:29:45,958 --> 01:29:50,054
No, I'm fine. It's just the SuperShuttle, it's
gonna take nine stops to get to my house.

1389
01:29:50,229 --> 01:29:53,721
Thought I'd pay for a cab, and I go
there, and the line's two miles long.

1390
01:29:53,899 --> 01:29:57,665
- Now I'm headed to the rental car place.
- Which is gonna take an hour.

1391
01:29:57,837 --> 01:29:58,929
- I'm gonna help.
- Really?

1392
01:29:59,105 --> 01:30:00,732
Yeah, I have a car.

1393
01:30:01,006 --> 01:30:02,166
I live in the Valley.

1394
01:30:02,341 --> 01:30:05,037
I want you to have it.
You traveled so far for a few hours.

1395
01:30:05,211 --> 01:30:07,702
You should spend every possible second
with this guy.

1396
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:09,074
And it's already paid for.

1397
01:30:09,248 --> 01:30:11,614
Redmond will take you
wherever you need to go.

1398
01:30:11,784 --> 01:30:13,684
You just give him the address.

1399
01:30:16,422 --> 01:30:18,652
Thank you. Thank you.

1400
01:30:21,660 --> 01:30:23,491
He's a lucky man.

1401
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:29,861
- Thank you.
- Bye.

1402
01:30:33,806 --> 01:30:36,536
Rani, sweetheart, why are you moping?

1403
01:30:36,709 --> 01:30:39,769
Is this about a boy
because it's Valentine's Day?

1404
01:30:39,945 --> 01:30:43,403
Did you get many valentines?
Oh, sweetheart, don't be sad.

1405
01:30:43,582 --> 01:30:45,641
When the time is right, your father and I...

1406
01:30:45,818 --> 01:30:48,116
...we are going to find you
a nice Indian boy.

1407
01:30:48,988 --> 01:30:52,082
Hey, cheer up, Rani.
I'll be your valentine.

1408
01:30:52,258 --> 01:30:54,249
Alex, please, for now,
be our delivery boy.

1409
01:30:54,426 --> 01:30:58,487
I have an Indian wedding,
and I have a private party going on.

1410
01:31:00,566 --> 01:31:01,897
Perfect.

1411
01:31:02,067 --> 01:31:03,728
Beverly Wilshire, this is Michelle.

1412
01:31:03,903 --> 01:31:07,202
Yeah, I'm gonna have to put you on hold.
All right, thanks. Bye-bye.

1413
01:31:07,373 --> 01:31:08,397
Excuse me.

1414
01:31:08,574 --> 01:31:12,135
You didn't happen to see a really pretty girl,
blue dress, come through here?

1415
01:31:12,311 --> 01:31:17,044
- Are you a guest of the hotel, or...?
- No, we were at the early seating.

1416
01:31:17,216 --> 01:31:20,208
Okay. Yeah, she was on the phone,
and she just went out that way.

1417
01:31:20,386 --> 01:31:22,616
- Oh, okay. Thanks.
- Yeah, no problem.

1418
01:31:23,489 --> 01:31:26,481
Put the blindfold on right now, Stanley.

1419
01:31:26,659 --> 01:31:28,889
Oh, you know what's gonna happen
when you do.

1420
01:31:29,061 --> 01:31:31,154
Sugar and your little kitty cat...

1421
01:31:31,764 --> 01:31:36,258
...oh, we're gonna lick you
all up and down.

1422
01:31:36,435 --> 01:31:41,168
Scratchy little tongues
going up and down your...

1423
01:31:41,340 --> 01:31:44,241
Oh! Rrrrr. Mm.

1424
01:31:44,410 --> 01:31:49,074
Oh, Stanley, I'm gonna have to have
a mint julep to cool down after that one.

1425
01:31:49,248 --> 01:31:52,479
Talk to you next time. Thank you.

1426
01:31:52,885 --> 01:31:53,909
Oh, God.

1427
01:31:54,086 --> 01:31:57,214
That is a really unusual way
to talk to your boss.

1428
01:31:57,389 --> 01:32:00,825
- It's not what you think.
- Really? Oh, awesome.

1429
01:32:00,993 --> 01:32:05,862
Because what I think it is is you leaving me
to talk dirty to your boyfriend, Stanley. So...

1430
01:32:06,031 --> 01:32:07,828
- No, no, no.
- What a relief to know...

1431
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,492
...you're not someone who licks people
with their scratchy kitty-cat tongue.

1432
01:32:11,670 --> 01:32:14,639
I moonlight
as an adult-phone entertainer.

1433
01:32:15,875 --> 01:32:19,003
- Like phone sex?
- Yes.

1434
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:24,147
This is the busiest day of the year
for phone sex.

1435
01:32:24,316 --> 01:32:25,442
Surprise.

1436
01:32:29,788 --> 01:32:31,312
Why didn't you tell me?

1437
01:32:32,591 --> 01:32:33,990
Okay.

1438
01:32:34,159 --> 01:32:38,823
I'm broke. I have a hundred-K student loan
I have no idea how I'm going to pay off.

1439
01:32:38,998 --> 01:32:40,260
I have no health insurance.

1440
01:32:40,432 --> 01:32:42,957
So if you know of a job
that will pay a poetry major...

1441
01:32:43,135 --> 01:32:47,231
...more than $40 an hour,
with her clothes on, I'm all ears.

1442
01:32:47,406 --> 01:32:48,771
Okay.

1443
01:32:49,375 --> 01:32:52,401
- I'm out.
- Are you gonna call me?

1444
01:32:52,578 --> 01:32:55,376
Well, you know,
I'd like to say yes, but...

1445
01:32:55,881 --> 01:32:58,042
...I don't know if I can afford it.

1446
01:32:58,517 --> 01:32:59,984
I'm sorry, that was... I'm sorry.

1447
01:33:01,487 --> 01:33:04,923
Come on, you know I didn't mean that.
I'm just... This is, like...

1448
01:33:05,090 --> 01:33:06,751
This is way too much for me, okay?

1449
01:33:07,559 --> 01:33:08,890
I'm from Muncie, Indiana.

1450
01:33:09,061 --> 01:33:11,495
Like, the wildest thing I ever did was...

1451
01:33:11,997 --> 01:33:14,659
...leave Muncie, Indiana.

1452
01:33:15,034 --> 01:33:17,559
- Look, this is me, it's not you.
- Yeah.

1453
01:33:18,170 --> 01:33:19,194
I just...

1454
01:33:21,006 --> 01:33:22,564
I'm sorry, Liz.

1455
01:33:28,447 --> 01:33:34,044
Welcome to the Hollywood Forever
Cemetery. Enjoy your romantic evening.

1456
01:33:34,219 --> 01:33:37,677
Please, everyone form a single-file line.

1457
01:33:41,293 --> 01:33:44,228
She said she would meet me right before
showtime. Here it is...

1458
01:33:44,396 --> 01:33:45,863
...but she's not here yet, and...

1459
01:33:46,031 --> 01:33:48,090
I got her these flowers
because I'm so sorry.

1460
01:33:48,267 --> 01:33:51,896
I mean, it was a small fire.
It's a small dog. Everything's fine, and...

1461
01:33:52,638 --> 01:33:54,765
We're sold out.

1462
01:33:54,940 --> 01:33:58,876
Oh, I'm sorry, sir, but we are completely
sold out. Only pre-sold tickets.

1463
01:33:59,044 --> 01:34:01,376
No, you don't understand.
I need a ticket tonight.

1464
01:34:01,547 --> 01:34:03,981
But I mean, I packed a basket.
It's got her favorite.

1465
01:34:04,149 --> 01:34:05,912
- Ham hocks and squid and...
- Actually...

1466
01:34:06,085 --> 01:34:08,280
...you know what, sir?

1467
01:34:08,454 --> 01:34:10,149
I have an extra ticket.

1468
01:34:10,322 --> 01:34:12,790
- Oh, that's your ticket?
- That's my ticket.

1469
01:34:12,958 --> 01:34:17,327
It's your lucky night. Have a great time.
All right, everyone, we are sold out.

1470
01:34:17,496 --> 01:34:20,465
- So who do I thank?
- Jason, from Indiana.

1471
01:34:20,632 --> 01:34:22,293
Edgar, from New York.

1472
01:34:22,468 --> 01:34:25,904
Yeah, my wife and I used to come here
every Valentine's Day, but...

1473
01:34:26,071 --> 01:34:28,198
Well, except tonight.

1474
01:34:28,374 --> 01:34:31,639
Well, you know,
I had the extra ticket, so...

1475
01:34:31,810 --> 01:34:34,608
On Valentine's Day.
Well, there's gotta be a story there.

1476
01:34:34,780 --> 01:34:37,340
Well, yeah, not a good one.

1477
01:34:37,516 --> 01:34:40,815
Pretty much the worst
Valentine's Day story of all time.

1478
01:34:40,986 --> 01:34:42,681
You wanna bet?

1479
01:34:42,855 --> 01:34:43,879
Thank you, officers.

1480
01:34:44,056 --> 01:34:46,320
- Thank you, Nikki. They're beautiful.
- Thank you.

1481
01:34:46,492 --> 01:34:48,187
Siena Bouquet.

1482
01:34:49,461 --> 01:34:52,294
Yeah, we're still open
for about another hour.

1483
01:34:52,464 --> 01:34:54,056
Mister?

1484
01:34:54,867 --> 01:35:00,396
You owe me flowers.

1485
01:35:06,045 --> 01:35:07,069
Where we taking them?

1486
01:35:16,822 --> 01:35:20,383
Okay,
I'm gonna go now. Have a nice life.

1487
01:35:27,466 --> 01:35:28,956
You came.

1488
01:35:31,737 --> 01:35:33,136
What happened?

1489
01:35:46,718 --> 01:35:48,310
He's married.

1490
01:36:18,484 --> 01:36:21,044
Now that's open-heart surgery.

1491
01:36:22,855 --> 01:36:24,413
- Peppermint Pattie?
- Yep.

1492
01:36:27,626 --> 01:36:30,993
Don't step on the people,
step on the grass.

1493
01:36:31,163 --> 01:36:32,892
Step on the grass.

1494
01:36:33,065 --> 01:36:35,192
This telephone girl, you like her, huh?

1495
01:36:37,202 --> 01:36:40,569
Thought maybe she had the trifecta.

1496
01:36:41,039 --> 01:36:43,132
Trifecta? What's that?

1497
01:36:43,308 --> 01:36:45,503
Oh, you know,
it's like the big three S's.

1498
01:36:45,677 --> 01:36:49,306
Smart, sensitive, sexy.

1499
01:36:49,982 --> 01:36:51,244
That's my trifecta.

1500
01:36:53,385 --> 01:36:54,613
- Her?
- Mm-hm.

1501
01:36:54,786 --> 01:36:56,447
You mean, like, literally, that...?

1502
01:36:56,622 --> 01:37:00,058
- Literally. Her.
- She was hot.

1503
01:37:00,792 --> 01:37:02,282
Still is.

1504
01:37:08,967 --> 01:37:10,059
Hey, hey.

1505
01:37:10,235 --> 01:37:11,566
- You guys came!
- You're here!

1506
01:37:11,737 --> 01:37:14,171
I thought you were going out
with your new boyfriend.

1507
01:37:14,339 --> 01:37:16,603
I thought you had a date
with your old boyfriend.

1508
01:37:16,775 --> 01:37:17,833
Same guy.

1509
01:37:18,010 --> 01:37:19,034
- No.
- Not surprised.

1510
01:37:19,211 --> 01:37:22,476
Booked back-to-back at the same
restaurant. Thought we wouldn't notice.

1511
01:37:22,648 --> 01:37:24,411
- What?
- Please lead me to the alcohol.

1512
01:37:24,583 --> 01:37:27,575
- Right here. Sit down.
- We are gonna take good care of you.

1513
01:37:27,753 --> 01:37:29,277
What happened to the pi?ta?

1514
01:37:29,454 --> 01:37:33,652
- Oh, it got what it deserved.
- Oh, more sad and Ionely people.

1515
01:37:33,825 --> 01:37:35,486
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Elise.

1516
01:37:36,061 --> 01:37:39,656
I'm driving around, looking in all
the places he's probably gonna be, but...

1517
01:37:39,831 --> 01:37:41,696
Anyways, like I said, just call me back.

1518
01:37:41,867 --> 01:37:45,928
But no big deal, I've got it under control,
so I'll find him.

1519
01:37:46,672 --> 01:37:49,436
I've found him! Found him.

1520
01:37:49,608 --> 01:37:52,771
Oh, my God, he's in a van. Shit!
What are you doing in a van?

1521
01:37:52,945 --> 01:37:54,537
Edison!

1522
01:37:55,881 --> 01:37:57,872
Burn, baby, burn!

1523
01:37:58,050 --> 01:37:59,074
Justin Levy.

1524
01:37:59,251 --> 01:38:01,515
Broke up with me
on the morning of my birthday...

1525
01:38:01,687 --> 01:38:04,485
...still showed up to my party.

1526
01:38:04,957 --> 01:38:06,652
Burn, baby, burn!

1527
01:38:07,426 --> 01:38:09,189
Ivonne Quinteros.

1528
01:38:09,361 --> 01:38:12,922
Dumped me for the piano player
at the Beverly Wilshire.

1529
01:38:13,098 --> 01:38:15,532
- Two hours ago.
- Oh, Charlie.

1530
01:38:15,701 --> 01:38:20,365
- Burn, baby, burn!
- Fire marshal know about this burning pot?

1531
01:38:20,539 --> 01:38:22,803
- Oh, hey, Kelvin.
- Hey.

1532
01:38:22,975 --> 01:38:24,067
Back to the wine.

1533
01:38:24,243 --> 01:38:26,734
- What are you doing here?
- I had a little time...

1534
01:38:26,912 --> 01:38:30,575
...before my 10:00 broadcast, somebody
said there was a gathering of my people.

1535
01:38:30,749 --> 01:38:33,183
- How did you find us?
- Heather.

1536
01:38:33,352 --> 01:38:37,049
Right, right. Well, welcome.

1537
01:38:37,222 --> 01:38:39,986
- Hi. I'm Julia.
- I'm Kelvin.

1538
01:38:40,158 --> 01:38:43,787
- Hi. So you guys know each other?
- Yes.

1539
01:38:43,962 --> 01:38:46,260
What misadventure of the heart
brings you here?

1540
01:38:46,431 --> 01:38:48,763
Oh, actually, I'm Kara's date.

1541
01:38:50,135 --> 01:38:53,434
- Fascinating.
- Yeah.

1542
01:38:53,605 --> 01:38:55,937
Whoo.

1543
01:39:03,615 --> 01:39:06,106
- Edison!
- All right, buddy.

1544
01:39:06,285 --> 01:39:09,118
- Don't move!
- I'm really, really sorry.

1545
01:39:09,288 --> 01:39:12,018
Okay, but you can't do that to me.
Do you understand?

1546
01:39:12,190 --> 01:39:14,886
I know, I know.
But this was really important.

1547
01:39:15,060 --> 01:39:17,858
- She had to get her flowers.
- Is everything okay?

1548
01:39:18,030 --> 01:39:20,726
- Yeah, I'm his babysitter.
- I'm his florist.

1549
01:39:22,501 --> 01:39:25,561
Look, I'm glad you're okay.

1550
01:39:25,737 --> 01:39:27,705
Do you want me to come in there
with you?

1551
01:39:27,873 --> 01:39:31,365
No. I think this is one of those things
I have to do myself.

1552
01:39:33,211 --> 01:39:35,304
I've been driving Holden for a long time.

1553
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:38,074
He's never given his car up for anybody.

1554
01:39:38,250 --> 01:39:40,275
You must be pretty special.

1555
01:39:41,753 --> 01:39:45,587
<i>Over?
Why do you keep talking like it's over?</i>

1556
01:39:46,158 --> 01:39:48,149
<i>I love you.</i>

1557
01:39:50,162 --> 01:39:51,789
Edgar!

1558
01:39:53,732 --> 01:39:56,758
<i>- Hey, get out of the way!
- I'll always love you.</i>

1559
01:39:56,935 --> 01:39:58,960
- Edgar!
- Excuse me.

1560
01:39:59,137 --> 01:40:00,729
Down in front!

1561
01:40:00,906 --> 01:40:02,874
Edgar, where are you?
I know you're out there.

1562
01:40:03,041 --> 01:40:04,235
Shh!

1563
01:40:04,409 --> 01:40:07,139
- Who the hell is Edgar?
- He is my husband, and shut your mouth.

1564
01:40:07,312 --> 01:40:10,509
- Edgar, answer me.
- Answer her, Edgar.

1565
01:40:10,682 --> 01:40:14,049
- Lady, I can't see through you.
- Edgar, where are you?

1566
01:40:14,619 --> 01:40:17,087
- Estelle!
- Edgar, answer me.

1567
01:40:17,255 --> 01:40:19,746
- Estelle!
- That must be Edgar.

1568
01:40:20,392 --> 01:40:22,690
I'm here! I'm coming.

1569
01:40:24,062 --> 01:40:25,586
Sorry.

1570
01:40:25,764 --> 01:40:28,631
- I see.
- Hey, run lower!

1571
01:40:31,937 --> 01:40:34,303
Listen to me. I know I let you down.

1572
01:40:34,473 --> 01:40:36,566
Maybe you don't think
I deserve forgiveness...

1573
01:40:36,742 --> 01:40:40,439
...but you're gonna give it to me anyway,
because when you love someone...

1574
01:40:40,612 --> 01:40:44,343
- ...you love all of them. That's the job.
- I know that now.

1575
01:40:44,516 --> 01:40:46,108
I'm so sorry.

1576
01:40:46,284 --> 01:40:48,912
And now, please, you gotta love
everything about them.

1577
01:40:49,087 --> 01:40:51,351
Not just the good things,
but the bad things too.

1578
01:40:51,523 --> 01:40:54,788
The things that you find lovable,
and the things that you don't find lovable.

1579
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:57,292
Shh. I understand.

1580
01:40:57,462 --> 01:40:59,760
I'll never leave you.

1581
01:41:24,022 --> 01:41:26,354
<i>At first I was afraid, I was petrified</i>

1582
01:41:26,525 --> 01:41:30,052
<i>Kept thinking I could never live
Without you by my side</i>

1583
01:41:30,228 --> 01:41:33,959
<i>Then I spent so many nights
Thinking how you did me wrong</i>

1584
01:41:34,132 --> 01:41:37,693
<i>And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along</i>

1585
01:41:37,869 --> 01:41:40,133
<i>And so you're back from outer space</i>

1586
01:41:40,305 --> 01:41:43,706
Julia, I found this little friend of Rani's,
and I think he's looking for you.

1587
01:41:43,875 --> 01:41:44,899
I'm not little.

1588
01:41:45,076 --> 01:41:48,534
Edison, are you okay?
Does somebody know that you're here?

1589
01:41:48,713 --> 01:41:50,704
Yeah, my babysitter's outside.

1590
01:41:50,882 --> 01:41:52,110
Okay.

1591
01:41:52,284 --> 01:41:54,115
<i>- Oh, now go
- Go</i>

1592
01:41:54,286 --> 01:41:56,117
<i>- Walk out the door
- Out that door</i>

1593
01:41:56,288 --> 01:41:58,347
<i>Just turn around now</i>

1594
01:41:59,191 --> 01:42:01,056
This is for you.

1595
01:42:02,627 --> 01:42:05,562
- For me?
- You're my valentine.

1596
01:42:11,570 --> 01:42:13,060
Thank you.

1597
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:17,440
Oh, this is beautiful.

1598
01:42:17,609 --> 01:42:18,803
Wha...?

1599
01:42:19,478 --> 01:42:22,970
Are you sure that I am really the person
that you wanna give this to?

1600
01:42:23,148 --> 01:42:26,549
Yeah. I mean, I think so.

1601
01:42:26,718 --> 01:42:27,742
Why?

1602
01:42:27,919 --> 01:42:32,583
Well, when you pick a valentine you have to
be sure that you choose the right person.

1603
01:42:32,757 --> 01:42:36,557
Or else you could be overlooking someone
who's even more special to you.

1604
01:42:39,331 --> 01:42:42,892
Rani? But I don't love her. I love you.

1605
01:42:43,068 --> 01:42:46,128
Is it our age difference
that keeps you from going:

1606
01:42:46,304 --> 01:42:48,169
Boom, boom, boom.

1607
01:42:48,340 --> 01:42:49,568
Yeah, a little bit.

1608
01:42:49,741 --> 01:42:53,268
Is it my height? Because I'm gonna grow.

1609
01:42:53,445 --> 01:42:55,174
Well, then, no, it's not your height.

1610
01:42:55,347 --> 01:42:58,942
It's just it wouldn't be right,
because I know Rani likes you.

1611
01:42:59,117 --> 01:43:02,348
Really?
Well, I like her a lot too.

1612
01:43:02,521 --> 01:43:05,820
She's the only other fifth-grader
who has Frank Zappa on her iPod.

1613
01:43:05,991 --> 01:43:08,221
- See?
- And she loves giraffes.

1614
01:43:08,393 --> 01:43:10,861
See, giraffes, it's something you guys
have in common.

1615
01:43:11,029 --> 01:43:13,429
See, it's things like that
that can turn a friend...

1616
01:43:13,598 --> 01:43:16,829
...from someone that you like
into someone that you love.

1617
01:43:17,736 --> 01:43:19,931
Has that ever happened to you,
Miss Fitzpatrick?

1618
01:43:26,144 --> 01:43:27,372
Hello?

1619
01:43:29,814 --> 01:43:33,250
<i>Hey, hey</i>

1620
01:43:36,988 --> 01:43:39,582
Back to the chocolate!

1621
01:43:40,325 --> 01:43:41,485
I am the chocolate.

1622
01:43:41,660 --> 01:43:44,629
Oh, you are.
Thank you so much for coming.

1623
01:43:44,796 --> 01:43:48,425
You are the most special valentine
I have ever had.

1624
01:43:52,137 --> 01:43:55,334
- But it was great. And bye.
- Bye.

1625
01:43:57,142 --> 01:43:59,610
- Don't know how to do that.
- I'll teach you.

1626
01:43:59,778 --> 01:44:02,178
- There you go. Right on... There it is. Close.
- Okay.

1627
01:44:02,347 --> 01:44:04,178
I know, you gotta go to work.

1628
01:44:04,349 --> 01:44:05,976
Bolly, bolly!

1629
01:44:12,324 --> 01:44:14,815
Here. Happy Valentine's Day.

1630
01:44:16,928 --> 01:44:21,194
I don't usually go for girls my own age,
but you're pretty cool.

1631
01:44:21,933 --> 01:44:24,094
Wow, thanks.

1632
01:44:28,807 --> 01:44:31,275
I don't really have anything else to say.

1633
01:44:31,943 --> 01:44:36,073
<i>Now I'm wondering
If your love's still strong</i>

1634
01:44:36,247 --> 01:44:39,876
<i>Here I am
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours</i>

1635
01:44:46,625 --> 01:44:47,853
I saw Edison.

1636
01:44:48,026 --> 01:44:50,085
I tipped the valet
to keep an eye on him.

1637
01:44:50,261 --> 01:44:52,661
I have the delivery van
set up over there.

1638
01:44:52,831 --> 01:44:56,130
We could take a trip to Mulholland.
Come check it out.

1639
01:44:56,301 --> 01:45:01,432
- Alex, can I be honest with you?
- I love it when you're honest.

1640
01:45:01,773 --> 01:45:04,139
I don't know if I'm ready for this.

1641
01:45:05,076 --> 01:45:08,204
- Lie to me.
- No, look, I'm serious.

1642
01:45:11,483 --> 01:45:14,077
<i>Signed, sealed, delivered</i>

1643
01:45:14,252 --> 01:45:16,015
I'm gonna go now.

1644
01:45:18,757 --> 01:45:21,521
<i>Signed, sealed, delivered</i>

1645
01:45:21,693 --> 01:45:23,092
Bye.

1646
01:45:26,831 --> 01:45:30,824
I guess that I thought that if we did this,
we'd have this special bond...

1647
01:45:31,002 --> 01:45:34,699
...and now I'm realizing that something
like this you can't just plan, you know?

1648
01:45:34,873 --> 01:45:36,670
It has to happen.

1649
01:45:37,375 --> 01:45:39,673
I mean, we have a chance
to make it happen.

1650
01:45:39,844 --> 01:45:43,780
But did you hear what you said,
"make it happen"?

1651
01:45:43,948 --> 01:45:47,440
We shouldn't have to make it happen.

1652
01:45:48,219 --> 01:45:50,380
Look, sit.

1653
01:45:50,822 --> 01:45:54,656
This is so sweet, and...

1654
01:45:54,826 --> 01:45:57,920
Look, Alex, I love you. I just...

1655
01:45:58,797 --> 01:46:00,992
I really think we should wait.

1656
01:46:01,466 --> 01:46:02,592
I'm sorry.

1657
01:46:04,836 --> 01:46:08,135
It's okay. I love you too.

1658
01:46:09,140 --> 01:46:10,573
And...

1659
01:46:12,143 --> 01:46:14,134
...we can still make out.

1660
01:46:29,761 --> 01:46:30,887
Bye.

1661
01:47:31,055 --> 01:47:35,424
Paula Thomas. Whoever this is better have
a good reason for calling me this late.

1662
01:47:37,328 --> 01:47:39,193
You want me to do what?

1663
01:47:39,998 --> 01:47:42,523
Boy, do you know who you're talking to?

1664
01:47:44,769 --> 01:47:46,634
Oh-ho-ho-ho.

1665
01:47:46,805 --> 01:47:49,069
Vladimir.

1666
01:47:52,977 --> 01:47:55,207
Well, let me tell you something, Vladimir.

1667
01:47:55,380 --> 01:48:00,408
You don't know what rough is
until you've dealt with a true African queen.

1668
01:48:00,585 --> 01:48:02,917
Let me get my stick.

1669
01:48:04,122 --> 01:48:05,817
Kneel to Nzinga!

1670
01:48:13,765 --> 01:48:16,461
Attention, I'm going home now.

1671
01:48:16,634 --> 01:48:19,694
But I wanted to say goodnight
to the world's greatest boss...

1672
01:48:19,871 --> 01:48:22,999
...and tell him that we all love him.

1673
01:48:27,478 --> 01:48:29,241
Good night, Nikki.

1674
01:49:40,752 --> 01:49:42,151
You saw.

1675
01:49:42,921 --> 01:49:44,354
Yeah.

1676
01:49:47,659 --> 01:49:50,560
I'd like to take to comment
on the story that we broke earlier.

1677
01:49:50,728 --> 01:49:52,696
Quarterback sensation Sean Jackson...

1678
01:49:52,864 --> 01:49:55,628
...has popped the lock on the closet
and come out.

1679
01:49:55,800 --> 01:49:59,736
What does this mean? Will there be more
house music played in the locker room?

1680
01:49:59,904 --> 01:50:03,169
These questions aside, Mr. Jackson's
name is likely to be remembered...

1681
01:50:03,341 --> 01:50:06,606
...alongside Jackie Robinson,
Muhammad Ali, and Billie Jean King...

1682
01:50:06,778 --> 01:50:09,212
...who endured their share
of trash-talking as well.

1683
01:50:09,380 --> 01:50:13,316
But let's allow future generations to decide
where to place Sean Jackson in history.

1684
01:50:13,484 --> 01:50:16,044
But let's be clear: It's not about defiance...

1685
01:50:16,220 --> 01:50:19,212
...it's about what a man will do for love.

1686
01:50:19,390 --> 01:50:22,553
I stand behind you, Sean. Metaphorically.

1687
01:50:22,727 --> 01:50:23,785
- Oh, jeez.
- Thank you.

1688
01:50:23,962 --> 01:50:25,088
Good night.

1689
01:50:25,797 --> 01:50:27,992
And that's it for tonight's news.

1690
01:50:28,166 --> 01:50:34,264
Happy Valentine's Day to all of you.
Sherry Donaldson for KVLA, channel 13.

1691
01:50:34,439 --> 01:50:35,736
- Good. Hey, man.
- Excellent.

1692
01:50:35,907 --> 01:50:38,398
- Hey, way to go, bro.
- Cue music, cue logo.

1693
01:50:38,576 --> 01:50:40,043
You sneaky little cupid.

1694
01:50:40,211 --> 01:50:42,679
You got romantic after all, didn't you?

1695
01:50:42,847 --> 01:50:45,441
I may get a few letters on that,
but I got your back.

1696
01:50:45,616 --> 01:50:47,811
- Thank you.
- Happy Valentine's Day, Kelvin.

1697
01:50:47,986 --> 01:50:49,180
Same to you.

1698
01:50:49,354 --> 01:50:52,653
Well, those stairs never looked so good.

1699
01:50:53,858 --> 01:50:57,225
Interesting perspective on Sean Jackson.

1700
01:51:12,477 --> 01:51:14,342
Just a second.

1701
01:51:20,184 --> 01:51:21,811
Who is it?

1702
01:51:24,355 --> 01:51:25,583
You forgot your camera.

1703
01:51:29,460 --> 01:51:30,518
Can I come in?

1704
01:51:34,699 --> 01:51:36,291
Sure.

1705
01:51:39,771 --> 01:51:42,763
Jason, I feel bad about
how you found out about my job.

1706
01:51:42,940 --> 01:51:44,840
It was awkward, and I'm sorry.

1707
01:51:45,009 --> 01:51:47,204
But that is the only thing
that I apologize for.

1708
01:51:47,378 --> 01:51:50,779
No. I should be the one apologizing.

1709
01:51:51,549 --> 01:51:57,181
If you want to be
a adult phone entertainer...

1710
01:51:57,488 --> 01:51:58,614
...that's cool.

1711
01:51:59,624 --> 01:52:00,989
I don't know, Jason.

1712
01:52:01,159 --> 01:52:04,856
When you found out something about me
you didn't like, you judged me and bailed.

1713
01:52:05,029 --> 01:52:07,930
I don't think that's a promising
foundation for a relationship.

1714
01:52:08,099 --> 01:52:11,796
You know what? You're right.
I just spent all night in a cemetery.

1715
01:52:11,969 --> 01:52:14,494
And I actually learned something.

1716
01:52:15,173 --> 01:52:16,367
In a relationship...

1717
01:52:16,541 --> 01:52:18,839
...you have to accept the other person...

1718
01:52:19,010 --> 01:52:22,537
...for all of what they are,
not just the parts that are easy to like.

1719
01:52:22,713 --> 01:52:28,151
And you're stupid if you turn your back
on something as important...

1720
01:52:29,153 --> 01:52:30,177
...as...

1721
01:52:32,924 --> 01:52:34,186
...Iove.

1722
01:52:37,829 --> 01:52:41,822
So I bought this for you. At the store.

1723
01:52:51,442 --> 01:52:53,433
And this one goes...

1724
01:53:11,395 --> 01:53:14,489
Sugar can't answer the phone right now.

1725
01:53:15,700 --> 01:53:19,295
She's got to make love
to her boyfriend on Valentine's Day.

1726
01:53:24,542 --> 01:53:27,670
And, for the record, this is what I like.

1727
01:53:27,845 --> 01:53:29,710
Simple.

1728
01:53:41,359 --> 01:53:42,621
Yeah.

1729
01:53:43,294 --> 01:53:45,762
Let's just keep it really simple.

1730
01:53:45,930 --> 01:53:49,297
- I also like make-up sex.
- Whoa, what a coincidence.

1731
01:53:49,467 --> 01:53:50,661
- You too?
- Me too.

1732
01:53:50,835 --> 01:53:52,325
Yay!

1733
01:54:18,763 --> 01:54:20,060
Hi.

1734
01:54:23,868 --> 01:54:26,029
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

1735
01:54:27,972 --> 01:54:30,202
What are you doing with the flowers?

1736
01:54:30,741 --> 01:54:32,936
They're all the ones that nobody wants.

1737
01:54:33,110 --> 01:54:35,271
So you're giving them a second life?

1738
01:54:36,314 --> 01:54:38,839
Yeah, most shops throw them away.

1739
01:54:41,152 --> 01:54:45,919
I like the idea that tomorrow, somebody's
gonna see them floating by and...

1740
01:54:46,090 --> 01:54:47,318
Yeah.

1741
01:54:47,491 --> 01:54:50,221
Wonder where they come from.
And the mystery of it all.

1742
01:54:50,394 --> 01:54:53,056
I used to actually put them together...

1743
01:54:54,031 --> 01:54:56,761
...and practice new designs with them...

1744
01:54:56,934 --> 01:55:00,392
...and drop them off at a random doorstep
with a note saying:

1745
01:55:00,571 --> 01:55:03,233
"Somebody out there loves you."

1746
01:55:03,574 --> 01:55:05,599
Then I got to thinking...

1747
01:55:06,944 --> 01:55:09,640
...what if they found out
that someone was me?

1748
01:55:10,214 --> 01:55:12,478
Would they want me to be the one that
loves them?

1749
01:55:14,518 --> 01:55:15,712
I would...

1750
01:55:18,289 --> 01:55:19,916
...want that.

1751
01:55:25,796 --> 01:55:27,457
Am I about to kiss my best friend?

1752
01:55:29,433 --> 01:55:31,128
I hope so.

1753
01:55:41,279 --> 01:55:44,442
- Not great.
- That was awkward. Awkward.

1754
01:55:44,615 --> 01:55:46,708
- Just not great.
- Yep.

1755
01:55:46,884 --> 01:55:49,648
- But this is my old... Where I get down.
- This is your spot.

1756
01:55:49,820 --> 01:55:51,583
You really helped me out. Susan is...

1757
01:55:51,756 --> 01:55:54,691
- Giving me a chance to be number one.
- Congratulations.

1758
01:55:54,859 --> 01:55:56,326
- Thank you, again.
- Thank you.

1759
01:55:56,494 --> 01:55:58,394
- I'm gonna have to teach you.
- That is...

1760
01:55:58,729 --> 01:56:00,788
- No... I'll teach you this.
- It's not natural.

1761
01:56:00,965 --> 01:56:03,331
<i>- Keep the fist... It's a little...
- Thank you. Okay.</i>

1762
01:56:03,501 --> 01:56:05,128
<i>- No, no, no. Open your...
- Open.</i>

1763
01:56:05,303 --> 01:56:07,771
<i>- You know what? I got a better idea.
- Not happening.</i>

1764
01:56:15,813 --> 01:56:17,246
<i>Okay.</i>

1765
01:56:17,848 --> 01:56:19,839
<i>That was nice.</i>

1766
01:56:23,220 --> 01:56:26,656
Well, you didn't exactly, like,
knock it out of the park.

1767
01:56:26,824 --> 01:56:30,726
Well, we've never practiced,
you have to admit.

1768
01:56:30,895 --> 01:56:33,955
- Maybe we should practice, then.
- Okay.

1769
01:56:52,316 --> 01:56:53,749
Mommy!

1770
01:56:58,756 --> 01:57:00,621
You're so big.

1771
01:57:04,395 --> 01:57:06,226
You're so big.

1772
01:57:21,812 --> 01:57:23,837
- Did you imagine it better or worse?
- I did.

1773
01:57:24,014 --> 01:57:26,278
- You imagined it better?
- I gave you more credit.

1774
01:57:26,450 --> 01:57:27,474
- Really?
- Yeah.

1775
01:57:27,651 --> 01:57:31,781
- Well, I hate that I'm not living up to my...
- Well, I don't know.

1776
01:57:45,870 --> 01:57:49,203
<i>It's Romeo Midnight, one last time.</i>

1777
01:57:49,373 --> 01:57:53,173
<i>Only 30 seconds left now
before it's just another day.</i>

1778
01:57:53,344 --> 01:57:54,868
<i>So count it down with me, lovers.</i>

1779
01:57:55,045 --> 01:57:59,846
<i>And raise your glass to those three
little words that we all want to hear:</i>

1780
01:58:00,017 --> 01:58:03,919
<i>"Let's get naked."</i>

1781
01:58:15,666 --> 01:58:18,658
I never had a inkling before, man.
I didn't know what to do.

1782
01:58:18,836 --> 01:58:21,270
I need to get to the airport.

1783
01:58:22,973 --> 01:58:24,497
Stupid...!

1784
01:58:30,181 --> 01:58:32,172
Vladimir! Let me get my whip.

1785
01:58:35,719 --> 01:58:39,086
You know I always
wanna answer yours first...

1786
01:58:41,459 --> 01:58:43,051
Oh! Just... Let's do...

1787
01:58:43,794 --> 01:58:46,957
I never had a inkling before.
I didn't know what to do with it.

1788
01:58:47,131 --> 01:58:49,190
Shoot, we gotta get to the...

1789
01:58:49,366 --> 01:58:53,097
It's stupid. Stupid seat belt!

1790
01:59:00,878 --> 01:59:03,312
Oh, there's a...
Hold it, there's a finger in there.

1791
01:59:03,914 --> 01:59:05,074
You on Facebook?

1792
01:59:06,217 --> 01:59:08,651
I can't hear out of this ear.

1793
01:59:10,387 --> 01:59:11,877
Are you guys on Facebook?

1794
01:59:12,056 --> 01:59:14,957
I never had a inkling before.
I didn't know what to do with it.

1795
01:59:15,125 --> 01:59:18,185
All right. I gotta get to the airport.

1796
01:59:18,362 --> 01:59:22,196
She's probably at the gate by now.

1797
01:59:22,366 --> 01:59:23,390
How did you do that?

1798
01:59:29,940 --> 01:59:31,931
- Hey, I'm Taylor.
- And I'm Taylor. Too.

1799
01:59:32,109 --> 01:59:34,805
Yeah. It's confusing. Yeah, we know that.

1800
01:59:34,979 --> 01:59:36,469
Marker.

1801
01:59:36,647 --> 01:59:38,444
If you look out the window,
ma'am...

1802
01:59:38,616 --> 01:59:40,140
...we're passing
the famous Rodeo Drive.

1803
01:59:40,317 --> 01:59:43,718
- Have you ever shopped here?
- I did once, actually.

1804
01:59:43,888 --> 01:59:47,949
But, big mistake. Big. Huge.
