1
00:00:29,081 --> 00:00:30,748
I hate television.

2
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:32,875
Gives me headaches.

3
00:00:34,336 --> 00:00:37,505
I heard there's so many magnetic waves
traveling through the air,

4
00:00:37,589 --> 00:00:39,799
because of TV and telephones,

5
00:00:39,925 --> 00:00:44,095
that we're losing like ten times as many
brain cells as we're supposed to.

6
00:00:44,513 --> 00:00:47,515
Like, all the molecules in our heads
are all unstable.

7
00:00:47,599 --> 00:00:50,601
All the companies know about it,
but they're not doing anything about it.

8
00:00:50,894 --> 00:00:52,729
It's a big conspiracy.

9
00:00:54,398 --> 00:00:56,941
You can pick something. I don't care.

10
00:01:00,612 --> 00:01:02,780
You have any idea
how many electro-rays

11
00:01:02,865 --> 00:01:05,241
are traveling through our head
every second?

12
00:01:05,534 --> 00:01:06,868
I got a better one.

13
00:01:07,286 --> 00:01:10,747
Have you heard about this videotape
that kills you when you watch it?

14
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,333
- What kind of tape?
- A tape, a regular tape.

15
00:01:14,501 --> 00:01:17,253
People rent it, I don't know.
You start to play it...

16
00:01:17,629 --> 00:01:20,131
And it's like somebody's nightmare.

17
00:01:20,507 --> 00:01:24,218
Then suddenly, this woman comes on...

18
00:01:24,303 --> 00:01:26,095
Smiling at you, right?

19
00:01:26,472 --> 00:01:27,764
Seeing you...

20
00:01:27,848 --> 00:01:29,599
Through the screen.

21
00:01:30,142 --> 00:01:31,976
And as soon as it's over,

22
00:01:32,644 --> 00:01:34,145
your phone rings.

23
00:01:34,772 --> 00:01:37,106
Someone knows you've watched it.

24
00:01:37,816 --> 00:01:40,234
And what they say is,

25
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:42,487
"You will die in seven days."

26
00:01:43,989 --> 00:01:46,199
And exactly seven days later...

27
00:01:46,366 --> 00:01:48,034
Who told you that?

28
00:01:48,285 --> 00:01:51,370
- Somebody from Revere. I don't...
- Who told you?

29
00:01:51,455 --> 00:01:52,455
What's your problem?

30
00:01:54,124 --> 00:01:55,583
I've watched it.

31
00:01:56,502 --> 00:01:59,670
- It's a story, Katie.
- Me and Josh, we saw it last weekend.

32
00:01:59,922 --> 00:02:01,214
I thought you were with your parents.

33
00:02:01,298 --> 00:02:03,091
- I wanted to tell...
- You were with Josh all weekend?

34
00:02:03,175 --> 00:02:05,802
Some of his friends got this place
up in the mountains.

35
00:02:06,345 --> 00:02:08,012
They were trying to record
a football game.

36
00:02:08,347 --> 00:02:10,348
- I guess the reception was so bad...
- What're you talking about?

37
00:02:10,432 --> 00:02:11,432
Listen to me!

38
00:02:11,517 --> 00:02:15,394
When we played the tape,
the game wasn't there. It was...

39
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,066
What? What was it?

40
00:02:21,777 --> 00:02:23,694
It was something else.

41
00:02:26,198 --> 00:02:28,991
We thought
it was some kind of sick joke.

42
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:31,494
And then the phone rang.

43
00:02:34,206 --> 00:02:35,873
It was a week ago.

44
00:02:37,417 --> 00:02:39,210
A week ago tonight.

45
00:02:42,381 --> 00:02:44,715
You're just trying to scare me.

46
00:02:53,892 --> 00:02:56,894
Oh, my God, Katie! Are you okay?

47
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,397
Oh, my...

48
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:01,899
You freak!

49
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:05,111
- You totally fell for it!
- No.

50
00:03:06,155 --> 00:03:10,158
So did you guys, you know, do anything?

51
00:03:12,077 --> 00:03:13,411
Like what?

52
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:17,039
Oh, my God, you totally did! You a ho!

53
00:03:17,124 --> 00:03:18,583
- Tell me now!
- No.

54
00:03:35,767 --> 00:03:37,560
There really is a tape?

55
00:04:01,752 --> 00:04:04,045
- This is so lame.
- Wait, don't!

56
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:05,671
Embry residence.

57
00:04:24,316 --> 00:04:25,358
Hello.

58
00:04:27,527 --> 00:04:28,778
Hi, Mom.

59
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:34,742
Yeah, that was Becca. My mom says hi.
She's glad you're here.

60
00:04:34,826 --> 00:04:36,786
Ask her where she keeps the Vicodin.

61
00:04:38,372 --> 00:04:39,872
Yeah, we're about to go to sleep.

62
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,708
Okay. Yeah, I will.

63
00:04:43,877 --> 00:04:45,836
Okay! Okay! Yeah, yeah, I will!

64
00:04:47,965 --> 00:04:49,340
No, I won't.

65
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:52,134
Bye, Mom.

66
00:05:17,703 --> 00:05:20,371
Becca, quit being a bitch.
Where's the remote?

67
00:05:46,064 --> 00:05:47,690
Becca, quit it!

68
00:06:46,124 --> 00:06:47,958
Becca, can you hear me?

69
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,104
Don't tell me what to write!

70
00:07:50,188 --> 00:07:51,981
That asshole's
screaming for my attention

71
00:07:52,065 --> 00:07:53,732
and I'm not gonna give it to him.

72
00:07:53,817 --> 00:07:55,359
I am being objective!

73
00:07:55,694 --> 00:07:57,778
Listen, Harvey, you punctilious prick,

74
00:07:57,863 --> 00:08:00,114
you touch my column,
and I'm coming down there

75
00:08:00,198 --> 00:08:01,323
and poking your eye out

76
00:08:01,616 --> 00:08:04,368
with that little red pencil
you like so much!

77
00:08:04,536 --> 00:08:05,703
Harvey?

78
00:08:06,163 --> 00:08:07,163
Shit!

79
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:13,294
Hey.

80
00:08:14,671 --> 00:08:16,213
Sorry I'm late.

81
00:08:16,298 --> 00:08:17,715
No worries.

82
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,885
I'll wait in the car.

83
00:08:22,512 --> 00:08:24,597
Have you got a moment, Miss Keller?

84
00:08:24,931 --> 00:08:25,931
Sure.

85
00:08:26,308 --> 00:08:28,809
- Call me Rachel.
- Please, sit down.

86
00:08:29,686 --> 00:08:31,896
He certainly is very independent,
isn't he?

87
00:08:32,022 --> 00:08:33,481
Yeah, he sure is.

88
00:08:33,565 --> 00:08:35,441
I never have to tell him to do anything.

89
00:08:35,525 --> 00:08:38,611
Well, if that's a problem, you'd be
the first teacher in history to say so.

90
00:08:40,906 --> 00:08:42,323
- Miss Keller...
- Rachel.

91
00:08:44,201 --> 00:08:46,410
I know that Aidan
recently lost his cousin...

92
00:08:46,495 --> 00:08:49,163
Yes. I'm doing what I can
to find some good daycare.

93
00:08:49,247 --> 00:08:52,458
No, that's not what I meant.
By all means, take your time.

94
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:55,586
I know they were very close,
Aidan and his cousin.

95
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,922
They spent
a few nights a week together.

96
00:08:58,006 --> 00:09:00,257
Did he talk to you about her death?

97
00:09:00,342 --> 00:09:03,344
Well, like you said,
he's not the talkative type.

98
00:09:04,095 --> 00:09:06,013
That doesn't mean
he has nothing to say.

99
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,726
He knows I'm there.

100
00:09:11,061 --> 00:09:12,728
Yes, I'm sure he does.

101
00:09:13,271 --> 00:09:16,815
But he may be expressing himself in...

102
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,526
Other ways.

103
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:20,402
I'd like to show you something.

104
00:09:31,122 --> 00:09:32,748
That's his cousin.

105
00:09:33,542 --> 00:09:34,542
That's Katie.

106
00:09:35,377 --> 00:09:36,877
Miss Keller,

107
00:09:37,045 --> 00:09:39,296
I'm bothered by these drawings.

108
00:09:42,425 --> 00:09:44,885
Listen, I appreciate your concern.

109
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:48,722
But my son lost his best friend
three nights ago.

110
00:09:48,807 --> 00:09:51,725
- He's trying to deal with it.
- I understand, but these pictures...

111
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:55,646
Are Aidan's way of working it out,
of expressing himself, like you said.

112
00:09:58,817 --> 00:10:00,401
He'll be okay.

113
00:10:02,237 --> 00:10:04,655
You say she died three nights ago.

114
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,199
Yeah, that's right.

115
00:10:07,284 --> 00:10:09,326
Aidan drew these last week.

116
00:10:34,352 --> 00:10:35,519
What?

117
00:10:38,106 --> 00:10:39,356
Nothing.

118
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,702
- Shall we read something?
- I'm kind of tired.

119
00:10:52,037 --> 00:10:53,162
Okay.

120
00:10:55,373 --> 00:10:56,874
Sweet dreams.

121
00:11:00,003 --> 00:11:01,045
We don't have enough time.

122
00:11:04,007 --> 00:11:06,884
Oh, honey,
I know I've been working a lot.

123
00:11:07,385 --> 00:11:10,554
And I'm sorry, but I promise you,
I'm gonna make it up to you.

124
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:12,473
I'm not talking about that.

125
00:11:13,016 --> 00:11:15,643
I'm talking about time before we die.

126
00:11:17,812 --> 00:11:19,271
You have lots of time.

127
00:11:19,814 --> 00:11:21,899
So you know when I'm going to die?

128
00:11:22,025 --> 00:11:23,984
No. No one does.

129
00:11:24,986 --> 00:11:27,237
But I know
you don't have to worry about it.

130
00:11:28,907 --> 00:11:31,492
Katie knew. She told me.

131
00:11:32,077 --> 00:11:34,495
Katie told you she was going to die?

132
00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:36,789
She said she didn't have enough time.

133
00:11:39,918 --> 00:11:41,669
Good night, Rachel.

134
00:11:59,938 --> 00:12:01,188
Oh, shit!

135
00:12:04,693 --> 00:12:05,859
Aidan!

136
00:12:08,363 --> 00:12:09,530
God damn it!

137
00:12:09,698 --> 00:12:12,408
Honey, have you seen my black dress?

138
00:12:13,952 --> 00:12:14,952
Aidan?

139
00:12:16,204 --> 00:12:18,122
Have you seen my black...

140
00:12:18,623 --> 00:12:19,748
Dress?

141
00:12:23,461 --> 00:12:25,212
It's a little wrinkled.

142
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,094
It's fine.

143
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,135
Thank you.

144
00:13:40,371 --> 00:13:43,832
Kids don't have strokes.
Unless they're on drugs.

145
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:46,168
So then, why the closed coffin?

146
00:13:51,049 --> 00:13:52,549
Ruthie.

147
00:13:53,718 --> 00:13:55,219
I'm so sorry.

148
00:14:05,146 --> 00:14:06,855
You all right, Dave?

149
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:11,068
Yeah, I'm fine.

150
00:14:12,237 --> 00:14:13,570
How are you?

151
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,248
He sleeps all day.

152
00:14:26,042 --> 00:14:27,709
He doesn't move.

153
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,838
It's too much for him.

154
00:14:33,758 --> 00:14:36,218
It doesn't make any sense, Rachel.

155
00:14:37,345 --> 00:14:41,682
I spent four hours on the Internet
and I couldn't find one single case

156
00:14:41,766 --> 00:14:44,726
of a 16-year-old girl's heart
just stopping.

157
00:14:46,104 --> 00:14:48,480
I spoke to three different doctors
and not one of them

158
00:14:49,023 --> 00:14:52,651
could tell me exactly
what happened to my daughter.

159
00:14:57,615 --> 00:14:59,741
She was close...

160
00:15:00,243 --> 00:15:01,451
With you.

161
00:15:01,786 --> 00:15:03,120
And Aidan.

162
00:15:03,288 --> 00:15:05,372
But she confided in you.

163
00:15:05,874 --> 00:15:08,542
Yeah, but she never said anything.

164
00:15:08,626 --> 00:15:10,836
Nothing that would explain
what happened.

165
00:15:11,296 --> 00:15:13,046
You could find out.

166
00:15:14,215 --> 00:15:17,092
It's what you do, isn't it? Ask questions?

167
00:15:19,804 --> 00:15:22,014
Rachel, please.

168
00:15:26,311 --> 00:15:28,145
I saw her face.

169
00:15:38,823 --> 00:15:39,907
I knew Becca.

170
00:15:39,991 --> 00:15:42,826
I mean, she was a little intense,
but she wasn't crazy.

171
00:15:42,952 --> 00:15:44,661
They don't put you in booties
and a straightjacket

172
00:15:44,746 --> 00:15:46,496
if you're just freaked out.

173
00:15:46,623 --> 00:15:48,707
Something scared the shit out of her.

174
00:15:50,209 --> 00:15:51,376
Hi.

175
00:15:53,922 --> 00:15:55,923
So who's in the mental hospital?

176
00:15:57,342 --> 00:15:59,009
Becca. Katie's friend.

177
00:15:59,469 --> 00:16:03,096
- Oh, right. She was the one who was...
- There when it happened.

178
00:16:04,265 --> 00:16:06,725
So what do you think
they were doing up there?

179
00:16:08,686 --> 00:16:09,853
Oh, thanks.

180
00:16:11,648 --> 00:16:13,941
I remember I was that age.

181
00:16:14,025 --> 00:16:17,861
Me and my girlfriend used to sneak up
to my room, get high.

182
00:16:18,613 --> 00:16:21,531
- Do you think maybe she was into...
- It's not about that.

183
00:16:23,034 --> 00:16:24,201
It's about the tape.

184
00:16:24,327 --> 00:16:26,453
Kellen, don't even...

185
00:16:26,663 --> 00:16:27,663
What tape?

186
00:16:28,373 --> 00:16:29,790
The one that kills you when you watch it.

187
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,333
Oh, please!

188
00:16:32,001 --> 00:16:33,710
What was on the tape?

189
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:36,546
I haven't seen it, obviously.

190
00:16:36,673 --> 00:16:38,632
But Katie told you she saw this tape?

191
00:16:38,841 --> 00:16:41,176
Not Katie. I heard it from her boy...

192
00:16:43,179 --> 00:16:44,388
You heard it from who?

193
00:16:45,723 --> 00:16:47,432
She was dating this guy, Josh.

194
00:16:47,892 --> 00:16:49,559
He goes to Revere.

195
00:16:50,144 --> 00:16:52,479
- It was kind of a secret.
- Kind of?

196
00:16:52,563 --> 00:16:54,564
Where is he? Josh. Is he here?

197
00:16:54,691 --> 00:16:56,316
Josh is dead.

198
00:16:56,401 --> 00:16:57,526
What?

199
00:16:58,403 --> 00:16:59,695
And what happened?

200
00:17:00,238 --> 00:17:02,239
Supposedly he killed himself.

201
00:17:03,741 --> 00:17:05,742
The same night that Katie died.

202
00:18:27,492 --> 00:18:28,492
Aidan...

203
00:18:29,327 --> 00:18:30,994
What are you doing in here?

204
00:18:33,456 --> 00:18:35,999
Come on. We shouldn't be in her room.

205
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,503
It's not her room anymore.

206
00:20:17,268 --> 00:20:38,038
"10:00 p.m."

207
00:20:42,251 --> 00:20:44,419
Time of death, Wade.
That's all I want to know.

208
00:20:44,503 --> 00:20:47,964
The name's Katie Embry.
Pull the report, read the time.

209
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:49,966
No, that's okay, I'll hold.

210
00:20:50,885 --> 00:20:52,636
"Punctilious prick?"

211
00:20:53,971 --> 00:20:55,805
Nice alliteration, huh?

212
00:20:56,057 --> 00:20:57,474
- You're fired.
- No, I'm not.

213
00:20:57,558 --> 00:20:58,725
Yes, you are.

214
00:20:58,809 --> 00:21:00,393
No, I'm not.

215
00:21:00,478 --> 00:21:02,729
I'm cooking too good a story.

216
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,524
- What is it?
- Yeah, I'm still here.

217
00:21:12,823 --> 00:21:14,741
Okay, so what's the time of death?

218
00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:04,874
- Hi, I was wondering...
- Pick a card, any card.

219
00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:06,626
Go ahead.

220
00:22:08,504 --> 00:22:09,546
Put it back.

221
00:22:10,214 --> 00:22:11,631
Don't let me see it.

222
00:22:17,305 --> 00:22:18,722
That your card?

223
00:22:19,056 --> 00:22:20,056
No.

224
00:22:20,975 --> 00:22:22,225
Damn.

225
00:22:22,643 --> 00:22:25,478
I was wondering if you'd remember
someone from a week ago.

226
00:22:26,105 --> 00:22:27,188
Was there a problem?

227
00:22:28,065 --> 00:22:29,149
It's my niece.

228
00:22:29,275 --> 00:22:31,693
She sort of ran out on her parents.

229
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:34,279
No.

230
00:22:34,822 --> 00:22:37,824
I have some photos here.
That's her and her friends.

231
00:22:38,534 --> 00:22:40,243
I think they stayed here a night or so.

232
00:22:40,578 --> 00:22:41,578
Yeah.

233
00:22:41,746 --> 00:22:43,496
They were in Cabin 12.

234
00:22:43,581 --> 00:22:45,123
They didn't pay.

235
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:48,877
They had a number of complaints.
About the TV mainly.

236
00:22:50,171 --> 00:22:51,504
Reception's never good here.

237
00:22:52,173 --> 00:22:55,091
That's why we bought tape players
for videos.

238
00:22:56,927 --> 00:22:58,094
Quite a selection.

239
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:02,932
Mostly they're hand-me-downs
left by other guests.

240
00:23:03,267 --> 00:23:05,727
Anyway, they didn't pay.

241
00:23:06,437 --> 00:23:08,897
And kids like that sometimes don't.

242
00:23:09,607 --> 00:23:10,607
Miss?

243
00:23:11,025 --> 00:23:13,026
You know, I'm kind of tired.

244
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:16,029
I'm thinking I might take a nap
before I drive back.

245
00:23:17,031 --> 00:23:18,782
I'll take Cabin 12.

246
00:23:31,712 --> 00:23:32,712
Hey.

247
00:23:34,465 --> 00:23:36,216
This is your card, right?

248
00:23:38,803 --> 00:23:40,095
That's it.

249
00:26:30,933 --> 00:26:32,308
Seven days.

250
00:27:02,089 --> 00:27:03,840
I'm going to school!

251
00:27:41,462 --> 00:27:42,962
What do you think?

252
00:27:43,297 --> 00:27:44,672
Well, it's a pretty cool effect.

253
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,468
What does this have to do
with the tape?

254
00:27:50,429 --> 00:27:52,055
Take my picture.

255
00:27:58,103 --> 00:28:00,355
Are you going to look at me at least?

256
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,487
This the same camera?

257
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,572
No. Scan the rest.

258
00:28:14,244 --> 00:28:15,912
So, what do you think?

259
00:28:20,417 --> 00:28:22,001
Look, I thought you said
this was about a tape.

260
00:28:29,593 --> 00:28:32,095
I'm thinking maybe you shouldn't see it.

261
00:28:32,304 --> 00:28:34,972
No, I should know more about it first.

262
00:28:35,265 --> 00:28:38,810
Well, isn't that why I'm here?
So you can benefit from my wisdom?

263
00:28:38,936 --> 00:28:40,895
Four kids are dead, Noah.

264
00:28:41,438 --> 00:28:44,524
Not from watching a videotape.

265
00:28:48,237 --> 00:28:50,154
Come on, show it to me.

266
00:30:04,688 --> 00:30:05,688
Roll credits.

267
00:30:07,524 --> 00:30:08,900
That was very student film.

268
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:13,821
I'm sure it's a lot scarier at night.

269
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,456
You going to get that?

270
00:30:42,434 --> 00:30:44,185
So, you been working a lot?

271
00:30:44,269 --> 00:30:46,020
I'm not tired, Noah.

272
00:30:47,356 --> 00:30:49,899
- Okay.
- That tape didn't scare you?

273
00:30:50,526 --> 00:30:53,611
- No, not really. Sorry.
- Four people are dead.

274
00:30:54,112 --> 00:30:55,279
Yeah. But, as I said,
not from watching...

275
00:30:55,364 --> 00:30:56,823
Four people who watched it.

276
00:30:56,907 --> 00:30:58,282
Come on. We watched it.
We're hanging.

277
00:30:58,367 --> 00:31:00,701
It takes a week.

278
00:31:02,204 --> 00:31:03,371
Right.

279
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,539
I'm just going to go downtown.

280
00:31:04,623 --> 00:31:06,165
I got to pick up
some cameras from this guy.

281
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,084
And then I got to prep this thing
I may do next week.

282
00:31:08,168 --> 00:31:09,168
Noah...

283
00:31:09,711 --> 00:31:12,505
- Would you say that I'm gullible?
- No.

284
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,841
- Easily rattled?
- Definitely not.

285
00:31:15,175 --> 00:31:17,593
You're a little highly-strung maybe.

286
00:31:18,428 --> 00:31:19,762
You ain't much of a dresser.

287
00:31:19,847 --> 00:31:22,390
Who made it? Where did it come from?

288
00:31:25,352 --> 00:31:28,187
All right. Make me a copy.
I'll see what I can do.

289
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:35,486
Thanks.

290
00:31:37,823 --> 00:31:39,407
Yeah.

291
00:33:28,934 --> 00:33:30,518
You sure this is a copy?

292
00:33:30,602 --> 00:33:31,644
Yeah, why?

293
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,690
The numbers are all screwed up.

294
00:33:38,276 --> 00:33:40,945
The same problem got copied, I guess.

295
00:33:42,406 --> 00:33:43,406
That's impossible.

296
00:33:44,241 --> 00:33:45,449
The numbers are the control track.

297
00:33:45,534 --> 00:33:47,159
They're put on the tape
whenever it's recorded.

298
00:33:47,244 --> 00:33:50,037
Which means, theoretically,
there shouldn't be any images.

299
00:33:50,914 --> 00:33:51,956
Hey, Noah.

300
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,792
Can you pretend for one minute
that I don't read Video Geek Magazine?

301
00:33:55,794 --> 00:33:57,753
Okay, when you record a tape,

302
00:33:57,838 --> 00:33:59,422
the makeup of the tracks
is like a signature

303
00:33:59,506 --> 00:34:02,925
for whatever did the recording,
like a camcorder, VCR, whatever.

304
00:34:03,093 --> 00:34:05,845
So the control track could tell us
where it came from.

305
00:34:05,929 --> 00:34:07,805
But to not have one...

306
00:34:07,889 --> 00:34:09,390
That's like being born
without fingerprints.

307
00:34:10,267 --> 00:34:12,184
Then how did this get recorded?

308
00:34:12,978 --> 00:34:14,020
I don't know.

309
00:34:14,771 --> 00:34:16,772
But I'm going to find out.

310
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:20,067
Take a look.

311
00:34:20,152 --> 00:34:23,029
You should be able to see the camera
here in the reflection.

312
00:34:23,113 --> 00:34:25,281
The angle's straight on, but you don't.

313
00:34:26,366 --> 00:34:27,408
What's that?

314
00:34:27,492 --> 00:34:29,785
Looks like she's walking away,
whoever she is.

315
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:31,871
No, I mean up there at the top.

316
00:34:32,831 --> 00:34:35,583
Oh, no. That's just the tracking.
I can fix that.

317
00:34:36,126 --> 00:34:37,376
What? Sorry.

318
00:34:37,461 --> 00:34:39,420
Wait, go back. There's something there.

319
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,465
- You're right.
- There's more picture.

320
00:34:42,758 --> 00:34:44,842
Hold on.
I'm going to stretch the alignment.

321
00:34:44,926 --> 00:34:46,886
- Yeah, it's working. Okay, keep going.
- It won't go any further.

322
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:48,095
- No, no, no. Let me do it!
- Wait, wait, wait!

323
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,472
- Come on.
- It won't go any further!

324
00:34:49,556 --> 00:34:51,640
- Get your...
- Let me do it! Shit!

325
00:34:54,895 --> 00:34:58,064
Noah, I picked up the cameras.
They're in really good shape.

326
00:34:58,148 --> 00:35:00,649
Did you see the reprints I did
of that Guatemala stuff?

327
00:35:00,942 --> 00:35:02,651
They came out kind of...

328
00:35:03,361 --> 00:35:04,695
Overexposed.

329
00:35:05,489 --> 00:35:08,783
- You working?
- This is a friend, Rachel Keller.

330
00:35:09,367 --> 00:35:12,953
She writes for the PI.
Rachel, this is Beth, my assistant.

331
00:35:13,497 --> 00:35:15,623
Well, I prefer "Partner in crime."

332
00:35:16,291 --> 00:35:18,834
She's a journalism student
at Kirkland, actually.

333
00:35:18,919 --> 00:35:21,837
Well, I'll stay out of your way.
I'm not even here.

334
00:35:23,757 --> 00:35:25,716
Rachel's researching a story.

335
00:35:25,842 --> 00:35:28,761
It's this video hoax.
It's sort of interesting. You know video.

336
00:35:28,845 --> 00:35:30,763
Why don't you come take a look
at this thing with the tracking?

337
00:35:30,847 --> 00:35:33,516
I'm late. I really should go.

338
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,727
- Yeah, but why are you taking the...
- I got to go. Good to meet you.

339
00:35:42,317 --> 00:35:45,152
- You're taking the tape?
- I don't want her to see it.

340
00:35:45,237 --> 00:35:47,947
You don't want her to see it?
What about me seeing it?

341
00:35:48,031 --> 00:35:51,659
- You had no problem showing it to me.
- I did have a problem.

342
00:35:51,993 --> 00:35:54,620
- You're angry.
- I'm not angry.

343
00:35:54,704 --> 00:35:57,081
- Oh, no? What are you then?
- In a hurry.

344
00:35:58,583 --> 00:36:01,001
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to get
all worked up

345
00:36:01,086 --> 00:36:02,378
over some high school rumor.

346
00:36:05,924 --> 00:36:07,049
What are you thinking?

347
00:36:07,968 --> 00:36:10,136
I'm thinking this is the part where I say

348
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,012
you're a flake, never finishes anything.

349
00:36:12,097 --> 00:36:15,224
Then you say I'm an obsessive bitch,
needs to lighten up.

350
00:36:15,308 --> 00:36:17,518
Then I storm out, all pissed off,

351
00:36:17,602 --> 00:36:20,938
kicking myself for ever thinking
that you could just...

352
00:36:21,022 --> 00:36:22,356
Grow up.

353
00:36:27,279 --> 00:36:28,988
So why don't we just
cut to that part right now

354
00:36:29,072 --> 00:36:31,407
and save ourselves a lot of grief?

355
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:35,995
All right.

356
00:36:36,705 --> 00:36:37,705
Bye.

357
00:37:06,026 --> 00:37:09,278
Watch out, missy. Bad luck.
You don't need that.

358
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,560
Becca?

359
00:37:42,395 --> 00:37:44,021
Becca...

360
00:37:45,023 --> 00:37:47,316
We're almost there.

361
00:37:55,575 --> 00:37:58,327
Do you remember anything
about that night?

362
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,996
That night with Katie?

363
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,084
Do you remember...

364
00:38:06,253 --> 00:38:07,753
How she died?

365
00:38:11,007 --> 00:38:12,341
Becca?

366
00:38:23,436 --> 00:38:25,145
She told you about a videotape,
didn't she?

367
00:38:31,319 --> 00:38:34,196
She was afraid, wasn't she?

368
00:38:34,281 --> 00:38:36,448
Something was happening to her.

369
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:37,950
Becca...

370
00:38:39,411 --> 00:38:41,453
How did she die?

371
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:43,455
Please.

372
00:38:44,457 --> 00:38:46,041
I need to know.

373
00:38:49,504 --> 00:38:50,879
And you will.

374
00:38:55,302 --> 00:38:56,927
She'll show you.

375
00:38:57,387 --> 00:38:58,554
Who?

376
00:38:58,847 --> 00:39:00,472
Who will show me?

377
00:39:01,975 --> 00:39:03,225
Not now.

378
00:39:11,735 --> 00:39:13,402
Four days.

379
00:39:20,243 --> 00:39:22,661
Yeah, well, your home VCRs
will give you a tracking window,

380
00:39:22,746 --> 00:39:24,121
but they won't let you stretch it.

381
00:39:24,205 --> 00:39:26,540
No point, really,
unless you're talking restoration.

382
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:29,418
Archives will come in here with these
crummy old tapes sometimes,

383
00:39:29,502 --> 00:39:31,754
tracks totally shot,
servos can't line them up.

384
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:34,506
But the big box here's a warhorse.
Totally analog,

385
00:39:34,591 --> 00:39:36,800
she'll read to the very edge of your tape.

386
00:39:36,885 --> 00:39:39,053
Just don't force her,
or she'll get pissy with you.

387
00:39:39,137 --> 00:39:43,015
Your tracking, your monitor,
your printer, if you need it.

388
00:39:43,683 --> 00:39:46,810
So, what are we watching?
Home movies or something?

389
00:39:47,854 --> 00:39:50,272
I'd really rather watch it alone.

390
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:52,900
Really.

391
00:39:53,818 --> 00:39:55,069
Whatever.

392
00:40:10,335 --> 00:40:17,508
Come on.

393
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,524
Lighthouse.

394
00:40:36,528 --> 00:40:37,611
Shit!

395
00:40:39,364 --> 00:40:41,073
Hello? Somebody?

396
00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:49,039
Dang.

397
00:41:24,325 --> 00:41:26,493
Something you needed help with?

398
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,746
Hey, you got a...

399
00:41:40,884 --> 00:41:43,927
- Well, this seems to be the lot of it.
- Thank you.

400
00:42:26,804 --> 00:42:28,388
"Moesko Island."

401
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:38,542
Oh, my God.

402
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:04,776
"Investigators search for answers
after second horse drowning."

403
00:44:22,587 --> 00:44:23,879
Anna Morgan.

404
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:47,611
"Suffered from hallucinations."

405
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:59,414
What happened to you, Anna?

406
00:45:11,761 --> 00:45:13,178
Pack of Double Lights. Thanks.

407
00:45:14,764 --> 00:45:15,931
$15.33.

408
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,729
You're going to die.

409
00:45:23,189 --> 00:45:25,273
My cousin was two packs a day.

410
00:45:25,483 --> 00:45:27,943
Used the patch, never looked back.

411
00:45:28,277 --> 00:45:29,903
All right. Well, I'll keep that in mind.

412
00:45:30,988 --> 00:45:33,198
- Have a nice day.
- You, too.

413
00:46:22,165 --> 00:46:24,040
- Hi.
- Sorry I'm late.

414
00:46:25,001 --> 00:46:27,794
- No. No problem.
- Everything okay?

415
00:46:28,171 --> 00:46:30,756
Oh, yeah. He was an angel.

416
00:46:31,048 --> 00:46:34,009
I went in to tell him that it was bedtime,

417
00:46:34,093 --> 00:46:38,346
and he was already under the covers.
And then he read me a bedtime story.

418
00:46:40,725 --> 00:46:42,684
He learned the word "conundrum."

419
00:46:42,769 --> 00:46:46,396
- Really?
- And then he drew my picture.

420
00:46:47,565 --> 00:46:49,816
Well, here you go.

421
00:46:50,359 --> 00:46:51,651
- Thanks.
- Sure.

422
00:47:23,976 --> 00:47:24,976
Hey, Ruthie, it's me.

423
00:47:25,436 --> 00:47:27,771
I'm sorry to call so late,
but I need a favor.

424
00:47:28,022 --> 00:47:31,358
I have to go upstate to do this story,
and I need you to watch Aidan for me.

425
00:47:31,442 --> 00:47:34,444
Oh, Rachel, I don't know.
How long will you be gone?

426
00:47:34,529 --> 00:47:36,154
It's just for two days, I promise.

427
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:38,240
This isn't the best time for me.

428
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:42,285
- Rachel? Rachel, are you there?
- Hold on a sec.

429
00:47:42,912 --> 00:47:43,954
Sorry.

430
00:47:46,332 --> 00:47:47,415
Rachel,

431
00:47:47,917 --> 00:47:49,251
is this about Katie?

432
00:48:14,527 --> 00:48:15,861
Ruthie...

433
00:48:38,426 --> 00:48:39,634
Aidan?

434
00:49:50,915 --> 00:49:52,207
No!

435
00:50:00,883 --> 00:50:03,051
Why, baby, why? Why?

436
00:50:03,344 --> 00:50:04,678
I couldn't sleep.

437
00:50:10,893 --> 00:50:13,144
Who is she, Rachel?

438
00:50:30,162 --> 00:50:31,746
Leave him alone!

439
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:33,540
Rachel?

440
00:50:37,837 --> 00:50:38,878
Noah...

441
00:50:38,963 --> 00:50:40,380
Listen to me, Rachel...

442
00:50:41,966 --> 00:50:44,092
I need to talk to you, okay?

443
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,264
I believe you.

444
00:50:50,766 --> 00:50:52,934
Rachel, are you there?

445
00:50:55,354 --> 00:50:57,105
He watched the tape.

446
00:50:58,691 --> 00:50:59,983
Who watched it?

447
00:51:04,321 --> 00:51:05,655
Our son.

448
00:51:30,973 --> 00:51:32,640
You take my picture.

449
00:51:37,021 --> 00:51:38,480
I've seen you.

450
00:51:39,648 --> 00:51:41,983
When I'm in the yard at school.

451
00:51:43,194 --> 00:51:44,694
You're there.

452
00:51:47,031 --> 00:51:48,698
Do you wish I was around more?

453
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,200
No.

454
00:51:51,827 --> 00:51:53,286
Do you want to be around more?

455
00:51:55,372 --> 00:51:57,999
- Rachel and I were...
- Young.

456
00:51:58,584 --> 00:52:00,251
Mom's told me that story.

457
00:52:05,216 --> 00:52:06,758
The thing is...

458
00:52:07,093 --> 00:52:09,427
I don't think I'd make a good father.

459
00:52:11,263 --> 00:52:13,765
Maybe it was because my own was...

460
00:52:14,767 --> 00:52:18,186
Such a disappointment.

461
00:52:26,362 --> 00:52:29,030
Thing is, I don't want
anyone else to do it either.

462
00:52:32,201 --> 00:52:33,743
Be your father.

463
00:52:35,037 --> 00:52:36,246
It's a conundrum.

464
00:52:41,043 --> 00:52:42,585
Yeah, it is.

465
00:53:21,125 --> 00:53:23,501
- Time to go, mister.
- I'm not finished.

466
00:53:26,088 --> 00:53:28,256
Noah said to make one for you.

467
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:38,975
You could almost draw a line
through her life.

468
00:53:40,603 --> 00:53:42,270
On one side there's this happy woman

469
00:53:42,354 --> 00:53:45,773
who spends her time
with her husband, riding horses.

470
00:53:45,941 --> 00:53:50,445
Everything sheltered,
protected and comfortable.

471
00:53:50,529 --> 00:53:53,531
Her face, there's light.

472
00:53:53,616 --> 00:53:55,241
There's pride.

473
00:53:55,326 --> 00:53:57,285
And then one day something happens...

474
00:53:57,369 --> 00:54:01,164
And she takes this hard corner
and the light goes out.

475
00:54:01,957 --> 00:54:05,293
And then she ends up
at Eola County Psychiatric,

476
00:54:05,377 --> 00:54:06,628
all alone.

477
00:54:06,962 --> 00:54:08,796
What happened to her?

478
00:54:09,381 --> 00:54:10,715
I don't know yet.

479
00:54:10,799 --> 00:54:13,968
But I think it has something to do
with the horses.

480
00:54:14,303 --> 00:54:15,887
I think we should go
to the island together.

481
00:54:15,971 --> 00:54:17,722
It's Tuesday, Noah.

482
00:54:17,806 --> 00:54:19,599
I only have one day left.

483
00:54:19,683 --> 00:54:21,392
I need you to go to the hospital
and find out

484
00:54:21,477 --> 00:54:22,727
as much as you can about Anna.

485
00:54:23,938 --> 00:54:26,522
The images on the tape
are leading us somewhere.

486
00:54:27,608 --> 00:54:29,484
Katie saw them all, too.

487
00:54:29,568 --> 00:54:31,236
I think...

488
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:34,364
Before you die, you see the ring.

489
00:54:47,503 --> 00:54:48,628
Shit!

490
00:54:48,879 --> 00:54:51,005
Hey, Rach! Wait!

491
00:55:45,728 --> 00:55:47,103
A daughter?

492
00:56:27,394 --> 00:56:28,603
Hey, you.

493
00:56:35,235 --> 00:56:37,904
It's okay. I'm not going to hurt you.

494
00:56:40,574 --> 00:56:41,949
Easy, boy.

495
00:56:45,287 --> 00:56:47,372
That's it.

496
00:56:53,670 --> 00:56:56,255
Hey, boy. I'm not going to hurt you.

497
00:57:02,137 --> 00:57:03,971
It's okay. Calm down.

498
00:57:07,851 --> 00:57:09,185
Somebody!

499
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:19,320
Jesus Christ.

500
00:57:23,367 --> 00:57:24,867
Somebody help!

501
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:31,207
Daddy, my horse!

502
00:57:35,504 --> 00:57:36,504
He's going out!

503
00:58:49,036 --> 00:58:51,412
I need to see the records
for a patient named Anna Morgan.

504
00:58:52,164 --> 00:58:53,915
Are you a relative?

505
00:58:54,166 --> 00:58:55,666
Well, no.

506
00:58:55,751 --> 00:58:57,001
I'm sorry, sir.

507
00:58:57,085 --> 00:59:00,171
We're a mental health facility.
Our records are private.

508
00:59:00,255 --> 00:59:02,924
Well, she's been dead 24 years.
I don't think she'll mind.

509
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,260
I'm sorry. It's impossible.

510
00:59:07,095 --> 00:59:08,304
Look...

511
00:59:09,056 --> 00:59:12,058
I've seen them before.
I've been up there.

512
00:59:12,142 --> 00:59:15,853
Nice try.
The record rooms are downstairs, guy.

513
00:59:18,649 --> 00:59:19,941
You win.

514
00:59:24,488 --> 00:59:25,780
Jerk-off.

515
01:00:06,113 --> 01:00:07,822
You in here, Anna?

516
01:00:59,666 --> 01:01:00,875
Hello?

517
01:01:59,101 --> 01:02:00,976
Excuse me, Mr. Morgan.

518
01:02:01,061 --> 01:02:03,270
I was wondering if you'd have
a moment to speak with me?

519
01:02:03,522 --> 01:02:06,107
My name's Rachel Keller.
I'm a writer with the Seattle PI.

520
01:02:06,233 --> 01:02:07,900
You want to know about the horses.

521
01:02:10,404 --> 01:02:12,446
I didn't mean to... It's just...

522
01:02:12,531 --> 01:02:14,198
I wasn't able to find
a number to reach you...

523
01:02:14,282 --> 01:02:17,201
Every now and then,
a writer comes along...

524
01:02:17,452 --> 01:02:19,203
Heard about what happened.

525
01:02:19,287 --> 01:02:22,790
What's left to write about, though,
I don't know.

526
01:02:23,417 --> 01:02:25,876
I was hoping you had
just a few minutes.

527
01:02:25,961 --> 01:02:28,796
Well, work never ends
around here, really.

528
01:02:29,214 --> 01:02:31,215
But I guess I got a few.

529
01:02:32,634 --> 01:02:35,136
So, what is it you're writing, miss?

530
01:02:35,637 --> 01:02:38,222
About horses in general
or just those that go strange?

531
01:02:38,306 --> 01:02:40,558
I read you had to put so many down.

532
01:02:40,642 --> 01:02:43,561
Most put themselves down.
They drowned.

533
01:02:44,146 --> 01:02:45,187
How'd they get out?

534
01:02:45,272 --> 01:02:48,816
They just broke through the fences
and ran to the shore.

535
01:02:49,276 --> 01:02:52,987
- So, they went crazy?
- It would seem so, yes.

536
01:02:54,072 --> 01:02:56,991
Or maybe they just sense things
before we do.

537
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:01,537
So, where are your horses now?

538
01:03:03,832 --> 01:03:05,207
I don't breed anymore.

539
01:03:06,793 --> 01:03:09,837
I guess you wouldn't.
Not after what happened.

540
01:03:10,839 --> 01:03:13,966
That must have been hard.
On both of you.

541
01:03:14,926 --> 01:03:16,635
You and your wife.

542
01:03:20,182 --> 01:03:23,017
I'm sorry, miss.
What's your name again?

543
01:03:25,479 --> 01:03:28,272
- Rachel.
- Well, Rachel...

544
01:03:28,356 --> 01:03:31,525
You want to tell me
what's really on your mind?

545
01:03:35,197 --> 01:03:37,198
Do you know what this is?

546
01:03:39,367 --> 01:03:42,953
I think it's a message from your wife.

547
01:03:44,539 --> 01:03:47,625
Anna's on this tape.
She's right there in that room.

548
01:03:48,043 --> 01:03:50,961
You can see the lighthouse,
the horses...

549
01:03:53,548 --> 01:03:56,634
- Where did you get that?
- Shelter Mountain Inn.

550
01:03:58,887 --> 01:04:00,471
Is that the only one?

551
01:04:03,058 --> 01:04:04,558
I made a copy.

552
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:14,485
I've got a lot of work to do today.

553
01:04:15,862 --> 01:04:17,905
A lot of acres out there.

554
01:04:19,074 --> 01:04:20,741
Minute I think I'm done with one thing...

555
01:04:23,745 --> 01:04:25,913
Another thing needs fixing.

556
01:04:27,415 --> 01:04:31,001
You don't want to see this tape?
You're not even curious?

557
01:04:31,086 --> 01:04:32,670
Curious?

558
01:04:32,754 --> 01:04:34,588
No. I don't think so.

559
01:04:37,592 --> 01:04:39,927
- Mr. Morgan...
- I can't help you.

560
01:04:42,097 --> 01:04:43,222
Where's your daughter?

561
01:04:44,516 --> 01:04:47,226
- Maybe she could help...
- I don't have a daughter.

562
01:04:48,103 --> 01:04:51,689
- Excuse me?
- What is it with reporters?

563
01:04:52,274 --> 01:04:56,277
You take one person's tragedy
and force the world to experience it.

564
01:04:56,945 --> 01:04:58,946
You spread it like sickness.

565
01:05:00,115 --> 01:05:02,074
- Mr. Morgan...
- Tell me, miss...

566
01:05:02,284 --> 01:05:04,535
What is it you think you know?

567
01:05:07,247 --> 01:05:09,248
Then leave it alone.

568
01:06:30,872 --> 01:06:34,041
"Anna Morgan's hallucinations."

569
01:06:36,044 --> 01:06:37,211
What's wrong with you?

570
01:06:42,884 --> 01:06:46,553
"Conceived, '65. Miscarriage, '66.

571
01:06:46,638 --> 01:06:49,139
"Conceived, '66. Miscarriage."

572
01:06:49,224 --> 01:06:51,475
Christ, she wouldn't give up.

573
01:07:27,762 --> 01:07:30,472
"See Video Record SM0015."

574
01:07:42,986 --> 01:07:44,820
Aidan, it's your mom.

575
01:07:53,705 --> 01:07:57,708
- Hi, Mom.
- Honey, the house you drew for me...

576
01:07:57,792 --> 01:07:59,626
Where did you see it?

577
01:07:59,794 --> 01:08:02,212
Did you see it in your head?
Is that why you drew it?

578
01:08:02,338 --> 01:08:03,714
In my head?

579
01:08:04,049 --> 01:08:06,800
Aidan, why did you draw that house?

580
01:08:06,885 --> 01:08:08,886
'Cause she told me to.

581
01:08:08,970 --> 01:08:10,012
Who?

582
01:08:10,346 --> 01:08:11,972
Who told you to?

583
01:08:13,475 --> 01:08:15,142
The little girl.

584
01:08:19,272 --> 01:08:20,939
She talks to you?

585
01:08:22,233 --> 01:08:23,275
No.

586
01:08:23,902 --> 01:08:25,903
She shows me things.

587
01:08:25,987 --> 01:08:28,155
Did she show you the horses?

588
01:08:29,199 --> 01:08:31,617
She doesn't like it in the barn.

589
01:08:32,327 --> 01:08:34,620
The horses keep her up at night.

590
01:08:36,081 --> 01:08:38,123
So she still lives there?

591
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:41,502
No.

592
01:08:43,129 --> 01:08:45,798
She lives in a dark place now.

593
01:09:12,408 --> 01:09:15,410
You're getting a little old
to be crabbing out there, Cal.

594
01:09:15,495 --> 01:09:18,038
Your body's about outlived its warranty,
you know.

595
01:09:18,123 --> 01:09:20,749
You ain't exactly the catch of the day.

596
01:09:20,917 --> 01:09:23,418
- Let's see you catch one better.
- Oh, yeah.

597
01:09:24,838 --> 01:09:27,172
Afternoon. I'm Dr. Grasnik.

598
01:09:27,715 --> 01:09:30,008
I think he was here before me.

599
01:09:30,301 --> 01:09:32,177
Darby? Darby's always here.

600
01:09:32,846 --> 01:09:34,555
Aren't you, Darby?

601
01:09:35,515 --> 01:09:39,017
He's my son's boy.
Come over on the ferry, did you?

602
01:09:39,102 --> 01:09:40,185
Yes.

603
01:09:42,605 --> 01:09:43,981
Have you lived here long?

604
01:09:44,065 --> 01:09:46,692
Born and raised.
Only doctor on the island.

605
01:09:46,776 --> 01:09:48,777
Then you know the Morgans
and their daughter.

606
01:09:51,531 --> 01:09:54,074
- Do you know their daughter?
- "Do you know their daughter?"

607
01:09:57,704 --> 01:09:59,371
What's this about?

608
01:09:59,706 --> 01:10:02,040
Look, I'm sorry.
I don't know how to say this,

609
01:10:02,125 --> 01:10:06,044
but I'm seeing things
in my head. Images.

610
01:10:06,129 --> 01:10:07,796
And so is my son.

611
01:10:08,548 --> 01:10:11,967
My son, that's why I'm here.

612
01:10:12,051 --> 01:10:16,180
And somehow, I don't know how, but...

613
01:10:16,264 --> 01:10:18,348
It's because of that girl.

614
01:10:22,103 --> 01:10:25,105
Haven't heard anybody say that
in a long time.

615
01:10:28,067 --> 01:10:32,362
She wanted a child more than anything.
Poor Anna.

616
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:36,617
They tried hard for years,
but sometimes it's just not meant to be.

617
01:10:36,826 --> 01:10:38,869
Then one winter they went away.

618
01:10:38,953 --> 01:10:41,205
When they came back,
it was with Samara.

619
01:10:42,415 --> 01:10:45,792
Adopted, they said.
Never did say from where.

620
01:10:46,252 --> 01:10:48,795
Said the mother
had died of complications.

621
01:10:49,130 --> 01:10:51,173
But they had their baby,
they had their horses,

622
01:10:51,257 --> 01:10:52,883
everything was fine.

623
01:10:53,301 --> 01:10:55,844
Until Anna started coming to see me.

624
01:10:56,346 --> 01:10:59,723
Said she was suffering visions.
Seeing things.

625
01:11:00,558 --> 01:11:02,226
Horrible things.

626
01:11:02,769 --> 01:11:05,312
Like they'd been burned inside her.

627
01:11:05,897 --> 01:11:08,440
That it only happened around Samara.

628
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:11,151
That the girl put them there.

629
01:11:12,695 --> 01:11:14,947
Were you Samara's doctor, too?

630
01:11:16,074 --> 01:11:17,908
Was there anything wrong with her?

631
01:11:18,409 --> 01:11:19,451
You mean, medically?

632
01:11:20,328 --> 01:11:21,536
I mean whatever you mean.

633
01:11:24,916 --> 01:11:27,167
When Darby there was born,

634
01:11:29,045 --> 01:11:31,797
we knew something wasn't right
with him.

635
01:11:32,090 --> 01:11:34,258
But we loved him anyway.

636
01:11:36,302 --> 01:11:40,430
Takes work, you know.
Some people have limits.

637
01:11:43,142 --> 01:11:44,518
So what happened to her?

638
01:11:46,562 --> 01:11:49,898
I referred them to Eola Psychiatric
on the mainland.

639
01:11:49,983 --> 01:11:52,109
I assume she's still there.

640
01:11:52,235 --> 01:11:53,777
You don't know?

641
01:11:54,904 --> 01:11:56,738
How can you not know?

642
01:11:57,991 --> 01:12:02,202
We've been through
a lot of hard years out here.

643
01:12:03,663 --> 01:12:05,205
Mean winters...

644
01:12:05,915 --> 01:12:07,708
Small hauls, no fish.

645
01:12:09,127 --> 01:12:11,670
And that was long before the horses.

646
01:12:12,422 --> 01:12:16,758
See, when you live on an island,
you catch a cold, it's everybody's cold.

647
01:12:17,427 --> 01:12:20,262
No offense, ma'am,
but what the hell does that mean?

648
01:12:21,347 --> 01:12:23,515
It means ever since
that girl's been gone,

649
01:12:23,599 --> 01:12:25,434
things have been better.

650
01:12:28,813 --> 01:12:30,647
1978.

651
01:12:30,732 --> 01:12:32,607
Man, we're really
going back in time here.

652
01:12:32,692 --> 01:12:34,484
Yeah, the lady at reception said
it should still be here.

653
01:12:34,569 --> 01:12:35,861
Should be.

654
01:12:35,945 --> 01:12:37,904
You say
you're the patient's father, right?

655
01:12:37,989 --> 01:12:39,823
Yep. Richard Morgan, that's me.

656
01:12:39,949 --> 01:12:42,909
- What is your secret?
- Diet and exercise, man.

657
01:12:42,994 --> 01:12:44,077
No shit!

658
01:12:44,162 --> 01:12:45,954
Yeah. That's all it takes.

659
01:12:47,165 --> 01:12:49,291
You know, I'm not an idiot.

660
01:12:49,834 --> 01:12:52,169
You try and walk out of here with my file

661
01:12:52,253 --> 01:12:54,838
and I'll be on you
like white on rice, understand?

662
01:12:54,922 --> 01:12:57,341
No, man. I just want to watch it.

663
01:12:58,926 --> 01:13:01,803
I'm responsible
for every file tape in here.

664
01:13:01,888 --> 01:13:03,513
I have a system.

665
01:13:03,765 --> 01:13:06,516
And I don't want anyone disarranging it.

666
01:13:07,268 --> 01:13:10,270
I'd never disarrange...

667
01:13:12,023 --> 01:13:13,815
Long as we understand each other.

668
01:13:16,152 --> 01:13:17,861
Okay, now I'm mad.

669
01:13:19,030 --> 01:13:20,322
Does it say who was
the last person to watch it?

670
01:13:24,285 --> 01:13:25,452
Yeah.

671
01:13:25,870 --> 01:13:27,079
It was you.

672
01:13:29,290 --> 01:13:30,540
Come on. Come on!

673
01:13:33,378 --> 01:13:35,754
The mobile unit you've called
is not responding

674
01:13:35,838 --> 01:13:37,047
or is outside the coverage area.

675
01:13:37,131 --> 01:13:38,590
You piece of shit.

676
01:13:42,428 --> 01:13:43,970
Come on, Rachel.

677
01:13:56,818 --> 01:13:57,984
Hello?

678
01:14:05,410 --> 01:14:21,091
Mr. Morgan?

679
01:15:56,812 --> 01:16:02,150
This is SM0015, Samara Morgan,
hour 14.

680
01:16:05,821 --> 01:16:07,155
Be good. Very good.

681
01:16:07,532 --> 01:16:10,325
So, what is it that's keeping you awake?

682
01:16:11,244 --> 01:16:13,203
You must sleep sometime.

683
01:16:14,830 --> 01:16:17,040
Do you dream about something?

684
01:16:18,918 --> 01:16:20,418
Samara?

685
01:16:24,924 --> 01:16:27,175
Let's talk about the pictures.

686
01:16:29,345 --> 01:16:31,263
How did you make them?

687
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:36,142
Samara?

688
01:16:37,270 --> 01:16:39,646
How did you make these pictures?

689
01:16:41,857 --> 01:16:43,191
I don't

690
01:16:44,694 --> 01:16:46,027
make them.

691
01:16:47,113 --> 01:16:50,949
I see them, and then...

692
01:16:51,993 --> 01:16:53,410
They just...

693
01:16:54,745 --> 01:16:55,829
Are.

694
01:16:56,414 --> 01:17:00,166
Samara, I need you to start telling me
the truth, okay?

695
01:17:01,210 --> 01:17:02,961
Can I see my mommy?

696
01:17:03,671 --> 01:17:07,340
No, Samara. Not until we understand
what's wrong with you.

697
01:17:09,010 --> 01:17:12,053
- I love my mommy.
- Yes, you do.

698
01:17:13,681 --> 01:17:16,975
But you don't want to hurt her anymore,
now, do you?

699
01:17:17,643 --> 01:17:19,894
You don't want to hurt anyone.

700
01:17:21,606 --> 01:17:24,524
But I do. And I'm sorry.

701
01:17:26,193 --> 01:17:27,694
It won't stop.

702
01:17:28,070 --> 01:17:30,280
Well, that's why you're here.

703
01:17:30,489 --> 01:17:33,241
So that I can help you to make it stop.

704
01:17:35,161 --> 01:17:36,661
He's going to leave me here.

705
01:17:37,788 --> 01:17:39,289
Who?

706
01:17:39,915 --> 01:17:41,124
Daddy.

707
01:17:42,585 --> 01:17:44,252
They just want to help you.

708
01:17:44,503 --> 01:17:45,920
Not Daddy.

709
01:17:47,715 --> 01:17:49,549
Your daddy loves you.

710
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:52,719
Daddy loves the horses.

711
01:17:55,556 --> 01:17:57,432
He wants me to go away.

712
01:17:59,602 --> 01:18:01,144
No, he doesn't.

713
01:18:02,396 --> 01:18:04,314
But he doesn't know.

714
01:18:05,024 --> 01:18:06,858
He doesn't know what?

715
01:18:08,069 --> 01:18:09,069
Samara?

716
01:18:13,783 --> 01:18:17,077
She's never gonna whisper
in my freaking ear ever again!

717
01:18:18,037 --> 01:18:19,954
What did you do to her?

718
01:18:24,377 --> 01:18:26,294
She was your daughter!

719
01:18:30,966 --> 01:18:32,384
You killed Samara, didn't you?

720
01:18:32,635 --> 01:18:33,968
You killed her and when your wife...

721
01:18:34,053 --> 01:18:36,763
My wife was not supposed to
have a child!

722
01:18:46,065 --> 01:18:47,107
Mr. Morgan...

723
01:18:49,110 --> 01:18:51,027
- What are you doing?
- The whispers...

724
01:18:51,112 --> 01:18:54,197
You could hear them all the time.
At night, in your sleep.

725
01:18:54,865 --> 01:18:55,990
Even the damn horses.

726
01:18:56,409 --> 01:18:59,119
- Mr. Morgan, come out of there.
- And those pictures...

727
01:19:00,204 --> 01:19:02,956
Christ! The things she'd show you.

728
01:19:03,749 --> 01:19:04,958
She's still showing them.

729
01:19:05,251 --> 01:19:06,960
And she'll never stop.

730
01:19:07,962 --> 01:19:10,130
You coming here proves that.

731
01:19:12,341 --> 01:19:14,509
Where is she? Please.

732
01:19:15,010 --> 01:19:17,554
I have to stop her.
If I don't, my son will die.

733
01:19:18,055 --> 01:19:21,015
Oh, yes. He will.

734
01:19:22,351 --> 01:19:24,352
- She never sleeps.
- Wait.

735
01:19:24,937 --> 01:19:35,196
No! No!

736
01:19:35,781 --> 01:19:38,408
Rachel! It's all right!

737
01:19:39,618 --> 01:19:41,786
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

738
01:19:43,873 --> 01:19:45,290
You're okay.

739
01:19:47,042 --> 01:19:48,334
You okay?

740
01:19:57,178 --> 01:19:58,553
Oh, Jesus.

741
01:20:14,069 --> 01:20:15,236
She doesn't like the barn.

742
01:20:18,073 --> 01:20:20,408
The horses keep her up at night.

743
01:20:26,707 --> 01:20:28,750
"She doesn't like the barn."

744
01:20:29,084 --> 01:20:30,210
What?

745
01:20:31,337 --> 01:20:33,421
The horses keep her awake.

746
01:21:06,247 --> 01:21:07,497
Samara.

747
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:46,828
He kept her here.

748
01:21:49,623 --> 01:21:51,791
Her mother was going crazy.

749
01:21:53,502 --> 01:21:55,461
Morgan blamed the child.

750
01:21:56,922 --> 01:21:58,756
So he kept her here.

751
01:22:01,594 --> 01:22:02,760
Alone.

752
01:22:04,138 --> 01:22:05,513
Not alone.

753
01:22:36,003 --> 01:22:37,378
Rachel.

754
01:22:41,383 --> 01:22:43,635
There's something under here.

755
01:22:52,019 --> 01:22:54,687
It looks like it's etched into the wood.

756
01:23:00,027 --> 01:23:01,152
Or burned.

757
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:31,766
I've seen this tree before.

758
01:23:32,685 --> 01:23:34,227
Yeah, it was on the tape.

759
01:23:34,561 --> 01:23:35,728
No.

760
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:38,064
I've been there.

761
01:23:41,318 --> 01:23:42,986
Shelter Mountain.

762
01:24:13,809 --> 01:24:17,895
The sun came through the leaves,
lit them up like it was on fire.

763
01:24:20,065 --> 01:24:22,525
Right at sunset.

764
01:24:25,612 --> 01:24:27,822
Right when I watched the tape.

765
01:24:33,954 --> 01:24:35,747
That was a week ago.

766
01:24:44,048 --> 01:24:45,965
We're back to where we started from.

767
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:49,802
Something led us here.
The tree, the drawing on the wall...

768
01:24:49,887 --> 01:24:51,429
It doesn't matter.

769
01:24:52,681 --> 01:24:54,265
We're too late.

770
01:24:57,061 --> 01:24:58,269
You have to help him.

771
01:24:59,188 --> 01:25:00,188
What are you talking about?

772
01:25:00,731 --> 01:25:02,190
Aidan.

773
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:06,402
It's up to you now. Just use the time
you have and figure something out.

774
01:25:06,487 --> 01:25:08,279
We're gonna figure this out
together right now!

775
01:25:08,363 --> 01:25:09,489
It's too late, Noah!

776
01:25:09,573 --> 01:25:11,866
Stop it! Okay?
There's a reason that we're here.

777
01:25:11,950 --> 01:25:13,242
- What?
- I don't know. Okay?

778
01:25:13,327 --> 01:25:16,829
But it's something in this room!
It's in this phone!

779
01:25:17,372 --> 01:25:19,332
It's in this television!

780
01:25:19,541 --> 01:25:22,085
Come on! Call us now, why don't you!

781
01:25:24,046 --> 01:25:25,088
Noah...

782
01:25:27,174 --> 01:25:28,257
Look.

783
01:27:09,943 --> 01:27:11,110
Jesus.

784
01:27:12,362 --> 01:27:14,238
How far down do you think it goes?

785
01:27:14,323 --> 01:27:16,032
I can't see anything.

786
01:27:26,543 --> 01:27:28,419
Now we should drop something.

787
01:28:05,207 --> 01:28:06,457
You think she's down there?

788
01:28:36,780 --> 01:29:12,315
Rachel!

789
01:29:13,025 --> 01:29:14,317
I'm here!

790
01:29:15,235 --> 01:29:16,736
I'm all right.

791
01:29:17,738 --> 01:29:18,988
I think.

792
01:29:19,406 --> 01:29:22,074
I'll go find something to get you out!

793
01:29:22,909 --> 01:29:24,076
Hurry!

794
01:30:09,623 --> 01:30:21,967
Noah?

795
01:30:22,135 --> 01:30:23,594
Noah!

796
01:30:30,644 --> 01:30:32,645
No!

797
01:31:01,758 --> 01:31:05,678
Round we go

798
01:31:06,221 --> 01:31:10,975
The world is spinning

799
01:31:11,351 --> 01:31:15,563
When it stops

800
01:31:15,856 --> 01:31:20,609
It's just beginning

801
01:31:26,366 --> 01:31:28,451
Isn't it beautiful here, Samara?

802
01:31:33,039 --> 01:31:34,498
So peaceful.

803
01:31:38,336 --> 01:31:40,588
I know things will get better.

804
01:31:51,808 --> 01:31:53,893
All I ever wanted was you.

805
01:32:35,936 --> 01:32:37,728
She was still alive.

806
01:33:16,518 --> 01:33:18,060
It's okay now.

807
01:33:19,938 --> 01:33:21,272
It's okay.

808
01:33:23,650 --> 01:33:24,900
Rachel!

809
01:33:29,447 --> 01:33:31,365
Rachel, the sun's set!

810
01:33:33,994 --> 01:33:37,204
The sun has set! It's past sunset.
Do you hear me?

811
01:33:38,290 --> 01:33:39,957
It's past sunset.

812
01:33:45,005 --> 01:33:58,601
Rachel...

813
01:34:03,898 --> 01:34:05,816
Rachel, are you there?

814
01:34:11,740 --> 01:34:13,032
I'm here.

815
01:34:30,759 --> 01:34:33,344
They're going to bury her next week.

816
01:34:36,473 --> 01:34:37,848
It's over.

817
01:34:45,649 --> 01:34:46,940
You okay?

818
01:34:48,693 --> 01:34:52,154
She wanted that child
more than anything in the world.

819
01:34:53,823 --> 01:34:56,033
How could she have done that?

820
01:35:00,121 --> 01:35:02,289
She just wanted to be heard.

821
01:35:06,044 --> 01:35:07,878
Sometimes children

822
01:35:09,047 --> 01:35:12,216
yell or cry or draw pictures.

823
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:28,941
I want to go home.

824
01:35:44,499 --> 01:35:47,543
I can't imagine being stuck down a well
all alone like that.

825
01:35:49,754 --> 01:35:51,922
How long could you survive?

826
01:35:58,596 --> 01:35:59,972
Seven days.

827
01:36:06,855 --> 01:36:09,273
You could survive for seven days.

828
01:37:18,885 --> 01:37:21,220
You just call me sometime?

829
01:37:21,971 --> 01:37:24,223
Unless you're renting a movie.

830
01:37:26,643 --> 01:37:28,310
Call me tomorrow.

831
01:37:33,024 --> 01:37:34,942
And the day after that.

832
01:38:16,359 --> 01:38:17,359
Rachel?

833
01:38:21,698 --> 01:38:23,323
What time is it?

834
01:38:24,409 --> 01:38:28,829
It's either really late or really early,
depending on how you look at it.

835
01:38:30,915 --> 01:38:32,791
Don't you have to be at work?

836
01:38:34,335 --> 01:38:35,711
Not today.

837
01:38:40,758 --> 01:38:42,759
What happened to the girl?

838
01:38:43,803 --> 01:38:45,304
Samara?

839
01:38:46,014 --> 01:38:47,681
Is that her name?

840
01:38:48,892 --> 01:38:50,809
Is she still in the dark place?

841
01:38:51,561 --> 01:38:52,561
No.

842
01:38:53,688 --> 01:38:55,314
We set her free.

843
01:38:57,609 --> 01:38:59,151
You helped her?

844
01:38:59,485 --> 01:39:00,569
Yeah.

845
01:39:01,404 --> 01:39:02,654
Why did you do that?

846
01:39:05,617 --> 01:39:06,742
What's wrong, honey?

847
01:39:06,826 --> 01:39:08,160
You weren't supposed to help her.

848
01:39:09,287 --> 01:39:12,998
It's okay now.
She's not going to hurt you.

849
01:39:13,082 --> 01:39:14,249
She...

850
01:39:20,381 --> 01:39:21,757
Don't you understand, Rachel?

851
01:39:24,719 --> 01:39:27,429
She never sleeps.

852
01:40:24,112 --> 01:40:26,113
Pick up the phone, Noah.

853
01:40:27,490 --> 01:40:29,157
Come on, pick up.

854
01:41:16,789 --> 01:41:20,250
Come on, Noah!
Pick up the goddamn phone!

855
01:42:25,817 --> 01:42:27,109
Come on!

856
01:44:15,134 --> 01:44:16,760
Go to your room!

857
01:44:16,844 --> 01:44:17,886
Now!

858
01:44:24,393 --> 01:44:26,853
What do you want? What do you want?

859
01:44:27,939 --> 01:44:29,689
What do you want from me?

860
01:44:48,459 --> 01:44:49,876
Why not me?

861
01:44:52,630 --> 01:44:54,839
What did I do that he didn't?

862
01:45:27,498 --> 01:45:29,666
She just wanted to be heard.

863
01:45:32,003 --> 01:45:33,962
He wants me to go away.

864
01:45:34,046 --> 01:45:36,464
My wife was not supposed to
have a child!

865
01:45:36,674 --> 01:45:38,216
All I ever wanted was you.

866
01:45:38,301 --> 01:45:39,718
Don't you understand, Rachel?

867
01:45:40,052 --> 01:45:41,553
But he doesn't know.

868
01:45:41,887 --> 01:45:43,138
She never sleeps.

869
01:45:43,431 --> 01:45:47,225
You take one person's tragedy
and force the world to experience it.

870
01:45:48,019 --> 01:45:49,561
You spread it like sickness.

871
01:45:50,104 --> 01:45:51,855
You don't want to hurt anyone.

872
01:45:52,773 --> 01:45:53,773
But I do.

873
01:45:55,318 --> 01:45:56,818
And I'm sorry.

874
01:45:58,738 --> 01:46:00,238
It won't stop.

875
01:46:05,077 --> 01:46:06,619
I made a copy.

876
01:46:09,457 --> 01:46:10,832
Push it in.

877
01:46:11,667 --> 01:46:12,751
Play.

878
01:46:13,711 --> 01:46:14,794
Push.

879
01:46:22,678 --> 01:46:25,347
It's going to keep killing, isn't it?

880
01:46:26,265 --> 01:46:27,932
She'll never stop.

881
01:46:28,976 --> 01:46:29,976
Don't worry, sweetie.

882
01:46:31,187 --> 01:46:33,355
You're going to be okay.

883
01:46:39,028 --> 01:46:41,821
What about the person we show it to?

884
01:46:42,782 --> 01:46:44,449
What happens to them?
