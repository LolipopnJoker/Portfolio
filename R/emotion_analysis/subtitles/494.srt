1
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:41,036
I am so worried for that boy.

2
00:01:42,371 --> 00:01:44,214
Joe's going to be okay.

3
00:01:44,915 --> 00:01:47,088
She was everything to him.

4
00:01:48,251 --> 00:01:51,221
Jack's going to step up.
He's a good man.

5
00:01:51,546 --> 00:01:54,049
But he's never had to be a father before.

6
00:01:56,426 --> 00:01:58,895
I don't think he understands Joe.

7
00:02:01,598 --> 00:02:03,191
How long did Elizabeth work there?

8
00:02:04,101 --> 00:02:05,774
Five years?
No, I think it was six.

9
00:02:06,103 --> 00:02:07,696
What do you think was in the coffin?

10
00:02:07,696 --> 00:02:09,273
Jesus, shut up.

11
00:02:09,606 --> 00:02:11,199
I am just saying, because of how she died.

12
00:02:11,942 --> 00:02:13,410
You guys weren't wondering that?

13
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,237
No. I am eating macaroni salad.

14
00:02:15,237 --> 00:02:16,663
I was wondering about that, too.

15
00:02:16,947 --> 00:02:18,665
I heard it crushed her completely.

16
00:02:18,665 --> 00:02:21,376
Steel beam, those things weigh a ton.
Literally.

17
00:02:21,827 --> 00:02:23,204
I don't know how you guys can eat.

18
00:02:23,204 --> 00:02:24,754
Try a turkey roll and you will discover how.

19
00:02:24,754 --> 00:02:25,877
Lucy, down.

20
00:02:26,289 --> 00:02:27,541
Get down.

21
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:29,798
Joe? You seen Joe?

22
00:02:29,798 --> 00:02:31,674
Bet Joe's not going to want to do
my movie anymore.

23
00:02:31,878 --> 00:02:32,925
Why?

24
00:02:32,925 --> 00:02:35,974
Why do you think why?
The story, it's about the living dead.

25
00:02:35,974 --> 00:02:37,471
His mother's not a zombie.

26
00:02:37,471 --> 00:02:38,928
But she's dead, shithead.

27
00:02:39,177 --> 00:02:41,179
These turkey rolls are pretty good.
Told you.

28
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:15,013
I just want to talk to you, Jack.
Get him out of here.

29
00:03:15,013 --> 00:03:16,635
Hey, Dainard.

30
00:03:16,635 --> 00:03:18,012
Would you just wait a minute?
Wait.

31
00:03:19,968 --> 00:03:22,642
Jack. Jack, just let me
No.

32
00:03:22,642 --> 00:03:23,768
Get out.

33
00:03:24,556 --> 00:03:25,603
Get out.

34
00:03:25,603 --> 00:03:27,104
Hey, Jack.

35
00:03:30,103 --> 00:03:32,105
I knew this was a mistake.
Jack, I...

36
00:03:32,105 --> 00:03:33,406
Jack

37
00:03:45,202 --> 00:03:46,419
Joseph, I will be home soon.

38
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:27,588
Oh, my God.
That was the longest day, ever.

39
00:04:27,713 --> 00:04:28,486
Here.

40
00:04:28,829 --> 00:04:30,797
What's this?
New scene. Check it out.

41
00:04:31,164 --> 00:04:33,087
Detective Hathaway has a wife now?

42
00:04:33,087 --> 00:04:34,964
I don't know.
I think it might make a better movie.

43
00:04:34,964 --> 00:04:36,090
Hey!
I need a better storyline.

44
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,216
and production value.
Guys.

45
00:04:37,216 --> 00:04:39,263
Hey, guys.
Martin barfed all over his locker today.

46
00:04:39,263 --> 00:04:40,431
It was the grossest one yet.

47
00:04:40,431 --> 00:04:42,384
Oh, my God. Shut up.
I never seen so many colors in my life.

48
00:04:42,384 --> 00:04:43,719
So who's going to play the wife?
Jen?

49
00:04:43,719 --> 00:04:45,804
No way. I told you what she did
with my top hat, ok.

50
00:04:46,054 --> 00:04:47,927
What wife?
Alice Dainard.

51
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:51,693
I was returning that book on codes
and ciphers.

52
00:04:51,693 --> 00:04:53,611
She was in the silent reading section.

53
00:04:53,611 --> 00:04:56,023
And I asked her if she'd play Hathaway's wife.

54
00:04:56,273 --> 00:04:58,241
Wait. You talked to Alice Dainard, really?

55
00:04:58,241 --> 00:05:00,159
You're not supposed to talk at
all in the silent reading section.

56
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:01,953
Shut up.
it's for silent reading.

57
00:05:01,953 --> 00:05:05,298
She said, Yes.
We're filming tonight and she's driving.

58
00:05:05,498 --> 00:05:07,747
Driving? Driving where?

59
00:05:28,513 --> 00:05:30,686
That was a really good zombie murder.

60
00:05:31,016 --> 00:05:32,484
Yeah, but it's not a story yet.

61
00:05:32,726 --> 00:05:34,478
Older kids are entering this film festival,

62
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:37,360
15 and 16-year-olds,
who have better stories and...

63
00:05:38,899 --> 00:05:41,652
cars and production value.
I have got nothing.

64
00:05:41,652 --> 00:05:43,458
Charles, dinner.
I am coming.

65
00:05:44,571 --> 00:05:46,414
There's this article I want you to read.

66
00:05:46,414 --> 00:05:48,742
It explains everything about stories.

67
00:05:48,742 --> 00:05:51,669
I just don't understand
how the wife helps make it a story.

68
00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:53,338
Jesus, this is what I have been explaining.

69
00:05:53,338 --> 00:05:54,665
That scene we're filming tonight,

70
00:05:54,665 --> 00:05:56,341
where the wife is telling the detective

71
00:05:56,341 --> 00:05:58,293
that she's scared for him,
that she loves him.

72
00:05:58,293 --> 00:05:59,798
I can't believe you talked to Alice Dainard.

73
00:05:59,798 --> 00:06:01,004
Charles, come on, move it.

74
00:06:01,004 --> 00:06:02,304
I am coming.

75
00:06:03,798 --> 00:06:05,266
And wash your hands this time.

76
00:06:05,266 --> 00:06:08,846
So when he investigates
the zombie stuff, you feel something.

77
00:06:08,846 --> 00:06:11,182
You don't want him to die because
they love each other.

78
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:12,686
That make sense?

79
00:06:12,686 --> 00:06:14,309
Alice Dainard.
That's awesome.

80
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,279
You're impossible.
Charles. Now.

81
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:19,607
God, Mom, I am coming.

82
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,643
Midnight, okay? Don't forget.
I won't forget.

83
00:06:23,443 --> 00:06:24,786
Read this.

84
00:06:25,153 --> 00:06:26,871
It's not fair that I can't go to Wendy's

85
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:28,490
Every single person will be there, except me.

86
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,416
Well, then every single person
can tell you how it was.

87
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:31,835
Move the puzzle, get the napkins.

88
00:06:31,835 --> 00:06:33,583
Mom!
It's your turn to babysit.

89
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:34,754
Why can't I switch with Charles?

90
00:06:34,754 --> 00:06:36,251
Maybe because you crushed Charles' top hat.

91
00:06:36,251 --> 00:06:37,423
You ever think of that?

92
00:06:37,423 --> 00:06:39,001
Oh, really? Well, guess what?
We're switching.

93
00:06:39,001 --> 00:06:40,711
Oh, really?
Because guess what? No, we're not.

94
00:06:40,711 --> 00:06:41,897
That's enough Charles!

95
00:06:41,922 --> 00:06:43,132
Take this to the table.

96
00:06:43,157 --> 00:06:44,472
Benji, time for dinner.

97
00:06:44,673 --> 00:06:45,720
Hey, Joe.

98
00:06:46,174 --> 00:06:47,346
Night, Mrs. Kaznyk.

99
00:06:47,346 --> 00:06:48,752
Take a seat. We have lots of food.

100
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:50,269
No, I am okay. Really.
Thank you, though.

101
00:06:50,269 --> 00:06:52,515
Put them at the table.
See you tomorrow, Charles.

102
00:06:52,515 --> 00:06:53,689
Later days.

103
00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:56,397
There's always a place for you here,
Joe. Do you know that?

104
00:06:56,397 --> 00:06:57,519
Stop it.

105
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:59,000
Yes, sir. Thank you.

106
00:07:14,744 --> 00:07:15,791
Dad?

107
00:07:21,042 --> 00:07:22,043
Dad?

108
00:07:22,043 --> 00:07:23,720
<i>that possibility with an announcement</i>

109
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,342
<i>that, while it is not likely</i>

110
00:07:25,342 --> 00:07:28,642
<i>the potential is there
for the ultimate risk of a meltdown</i>

111
00:07:28,642 --> 00:07:31,227
<i>at the Three Mile Island atomic power plant</i>

112
00:07:31,227 --> 00:07:33,100
<i>outside Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.</i>

113
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,440
<i>Robert Schakne reports from Washington.</i>

114
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:38,735
<i>According to the government's top</i>

115
00:07:39,135 --> 00:07:40,135
Hey.

116
00:07:40,937 --> 00:07:41,984
I will be out in a minute.

117
00:07:56,286 --> 00:07:57,859
It's a six-week program.

118
00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:02,133
Hands-on training with college coaches.

119
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:04,678
You'd like it. I know I did.

120
00:08:06,671 --> 00:08:08,469
I thought I was going to have
the summer for myself.

121
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:10,668
Well, things have obviously changed for us.

122
00:08:13,428 --> 00:08:14,930
And it'd be good for you to spend some time

123
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,641
with kids who don't run around with
cameras and monster make-up.

124
00:08:21,644 --> 00:08:23,988
I have to help Charles finish his movie.

125
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,710
I have got nothing against your friends.
I like your friends.

126
00:08:41,664 --> 00:08:44,543
Except for Cary, who can't seem
to stop lighting things on fire.

127
00:08:47,712 --> 00:08:49,180
You'd like it there.

128
00:08:49,964 --> 00:08:51,707
It's what we both need.

129
00:09:13,446 --> 00:09:15,448
<i>But they offered
you no real proof he was alive.</i>

130
00:09:16,616 --> 00:09:19,085
<i>And you didn't. The decision was made.</i>

131
00:09:19,085 --> 00:09:21,208
<i>So leave the past alone, Martha.</i>

132
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,584
<i>I can't.</i>

133
00:09:23,748 --> 00:09:26,797
<i>Well, how much would
a ton of gold be worth today?</i>

134
00:09:27,752 --> 00:09:30,596
<i>Okay, it's time. Don't get caught. Over.</i>

135
00:09:32,132 --> 00:09:33,505
I won't. Over.

136
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:50,199
Wait, so, guys,
people are turning into zombies

137
00:09:50,199 --> 00:09:51,801
because of the chemical factory, right?

138
00:09:52,777 --> 00:09:55,155
I don't see how the guy
playing Detective Hathaway

139
00:09:55,155 --> 00:09:58,250
can ask where the zombies
are coming from. Jesus.

140
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,746
Well, technically, Hathaway hasn't even...

141
00:09:59,746 --> 00:10:00,918
Shut up.

142
00:10:02,453 --> 00:10:04,455
Was that a rock?
I am sorry, Smartin.

143
00:10:04,455 --> 00:10:07,300
It was a Twizzler.
Hey, where'd it go?

144
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,007
Hey, guys, look. Guys, look. Guys.

145
00:10:18,511 --> 00:10:20,764
It's okay, Smartin.
Shut up.

146
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:22,982
Hey, Alice.

147
00:10:24,434 --> 00:10:25,481
Joe Lamb?

148
00:10:26,277 --> 00:10:27,124
Yeah.

149
00:10:27,324 --> 00:10:28,546
What the hell's he doing here?

150
00:10:28,938 --> 00:10:30,940
Make-up, sound and special effects.

151
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:32,196
He's the Deputy's kid.

152
00:10:32,442 --> 00:10:33,694
So what?
You knew that?

153
00:10:33,694 --> 00:10:35,548
Charles, I don't have a license.

154
00:10:35,573 --> 00:10:37,020
I can't drive with him.

155
00:10:38,114 --> 00:10:40,287
You want Joe to stay back? I guess...

156
00:10:40,287 --> 00:10:42,869
It's too late.
He's seeing me in the car right now.

157
00:10:47,207 --> 00:10:48,299
You can trust me.

158
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,877
My dad will never know.

159
00:10:51,001 --> 00:10:52,884
I won't tell him anything.

160
00:11:00,303 --> 00:11:01,304
Get in.

161
00:11:04,057 --> 00:11:06,560
So, I wrote a couple new lines.
Can I show you?

162
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:08,106
What?
New lines?

163
00:11:08,106 --> 00:11:09,233
Charles, do I have newlines?

164
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:10,359
Do you know what'd be great?

165
00:11:10,359 --> 00:11:13,154
Is if you could cry during the scene.
Can you do that?

166
00:11:13,154 --> 00:11:14,989
I am impressed.
No.

167
00:11:14,989 --> 00:11:17,116
You know the first place I am going to
drive when I get my license?

168
00:11:17,116 --> 00:11:18,913
Want one?
New Castle, Pennsylvania.

169
00:11:18,913 --> 00:11:20,035
Fireworks Capital of America.

170
00:11:20,035 --> 00:11:22,250
Wait, so, I don't have new lines, right?

171
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,747
Because I just learned these.

172
00:11:35,838 --> 00:11:38,136
Guys, there's an electrical outlet up here.

173
00:11:38,136 --> 00:11:39,513
Of anything, why that?

174
00:11:39,513 --> 00:11:41,349
Charles.
Got it.

175
00:11:41,678 --> 00:11:44,522
Charles, man, do I have newlines or not?
Oh, no.

176
00:11:45,014 --> 00:11:47,392
Well, you just lost all your new lines, Martin.

177
00:11:48,851 --> 00:11:50,653
Guys, this is going to be great.

178
00:11:52,563 --> 00:11:54,486
Get the lights and camera set up on that end,

179
00:11:54,486 --> 00:11:55,737
we will shoot this direction first.

180
00:11:55,737 --> 00:11:56,905
Joe, get the mike plugged in

181
00:11:56,905 --> 00:11:58,653
and make sure that
the new batteries are in the camera

182
00:11:58,653 --> 00:12:00,579
before you do the make-up.
Okay. Okay.

183
00:12:01,698 --> 00:12:04,872
I took apart two packs of cherry bombs
and I made my own M-80.

184
00:12:04,872 --> 00:12:06,248
Do you want to see it?

185
00:12:06,703 --> 00:12:08,330
Your obsession with fireworks,

186
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,211
and I am saying this as a friend,

187
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,838
concerns me and my mother.

188
00:12:12,838 --> 00:12:15,716
Sweetheart, this is my job.
I have no choice.

189
00:12:15,716 --> 00:12:17,297
It's nothing that you need to worry about.

190
00:12:17,297 --> 00:12:19,516
What am I supposed to do,
go to Michigan with you?

191
00:12:19,516 --> 00:12:21,843
Sweetheart, this is my job.
Martin. I wrote a newline.

192
00:12:21,843 --> 00:12:23,143
What?
No.

193
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:24,812
What do you mean no?
it's awesome.

194
00:12:25,388 --> 00:12:26,435
Okay, so, you know that part when

195
00:12:26,435 --> 00:12:27,557
I just finished memorizing this line.

196
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:28,891
it's not going to be hard

197
00:12:28,891 --> 00:12:30,022
Do you mind?

198
00:12:30,022 --> 00:12:31,148
So, you know that part when you say
No.

199
00:12:31,148 --> 00:12:32,987
Well, where'd the other line go?

200
00:12:33,563 --> 00:12:34,940
It's gone. This one's better.

201
00:12:35,273 --> 00:12:36,445
Here, I will

202
00:12:37,066 --> 00:12:38,409
No, it didn't.

203
00:12:38,735 --> 00:12:40,737
I have never even had any lines.

204
00:12:40,737 --> 00:12:41,912
I just needed this one.

205
00:12:41,912 --> 00:12:43,035
There.

206
00:12:43,035 --> 00:12:44,286
Thanks.

207
00:12:44,286 --> 00:12:45,408
Look, look. Look.

208
00:12:45,742 --> 00:12:46,743
Now I am not prepared.

209
00:12:46,743 --> 00:12:47,998
Look, it flows better.

210
00:12:48,328 --> 00:12:52,174
Honey, I love you.
I love you, too. See? It flows.

211
00:12:52,174 --> 00:12:55,548
I know, but you keep changing things
and making it more difficult for me.

212
00:12:55,548 --> 00:12:59,722
It's Martin, it's simple.
I love you, too.

213
00:12:59,722 --> 00:13:00,889
It's, like, four words.

214
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:02,808
My dad works at the mill.

215
00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:05,057
Four words that I don't have memorized.

216
00:13:05,057 --> 00:13:06,979
Martin. Can you say, I love you?

217
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:15,021
Could you close your eyes, please?

218
00:13:15,646 --> 00:13:16,646
Yeah.

219
00:13:20,818 --> 00:13:22,616
So, the scene is very emotional.

220
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:26,416
Alice, Mrs. Hathaway
really doesn't want her husband

221
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:27,583
to keep investigating these zombie murders.

222
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,831
Yeah, I know. We read it. We get it.
You really hate it.

223
00:13:30,161 --> 00:13:32,004
God, I am just directing.

224
00:13:32,497 --> 00:13:34,966
Martin. Martin, get in position.

225
00:13:34,966 --> 00:13:36,843
You need to reassure her.

226
00:13:37,043 --> 00:13:39,003
Wait. Do you know
what reassure her means?

227
00:13:39,003 --> 00:13:40,843
Yeah, I think so.

228
00:13:41,172 --> 00:13:43,274
Okay. We're going to shoot
on Alice's side first.

229
00:13:43,466 --> 00:13:46,094
Okay, Preston, so,
a few seconds after I say action,

230
00:13:46,094 --> 00:13:47,269
I want you to walk over to the pay phone.

231
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:49,188
You know, make the place
look like it's busy.

232
00:13:49,514 --> 00:13:51,516
Hello, hello?
I know what that looks like.

233
00:13:54,685 --> 00:13:55,596
Asshole!

234
00:13:55,621 --> 00:13:58,648
Could you stop blowing shit up for two
seconds and deal with the camera?

235
00:13:58,823 --> 00:14:00,249
God. Sorry, man.

236
00:14:00,858 --> 00:14:02,451
Okay, you guys, let's rehearse this.

237
00:14:02,451 --> 00:14:05,531
But remember, save the real
performance for when we're filming.

238
00:14:05,863 --> 00:14:07,591
Here we go. Positions, and...

239
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:09,371
action.

240
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,828
So, I am going to stay here
and investigate.

241
00:14:12,036 --> 00:14:14,380
I think it'd be safer if you left town
for a couple of days.

242
00:14:14,705 --> 00:14:18,005
John, I don't like it.
This case. These murders.

243
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:19,961
Well, what am I supposed to do,

244
00:14:19,961 --> 00:14:21,546
go to Michigan with you?

245
00:14:22,213 --> 00:14:25,012
Mackinac island's beautiful
this time of year.

246
00:14:25,341 --> 00:14:27,389
Sweetheart, this is my job.

247
00:14:28,177 --> 00:14:30,396
The dead coming back to life?

248
00:14:30,888 --> 00:14:33,186
I think you're in danger.
I have no...

249
00:14:34,392 --> 00:14:36,394
I have no choice.

250
00:14:36,602 --> 00:14:38,400
You do have a choice.

251
00:14:39,063 --> 00:14:40,565
We all do.

252
00:14:45,069 --> 00:14:46,241
John,

253
00:14:46,946 --> 00:14:48,914
I have never asked you to stop.

254
00:14:50,241 --> 00:14:53,085
I have never asked you to give up,
or walk away,

255
00:14:53,744 --> 00:14:55,587
but I am asking you now.

256
00:14:56,456 --> 00:14:57,799
Please.

257
00:14:58,583 --> 00:14:59,926
For me.

258
00:15:00,751 --> 00:15:01,832
Don't go.

259
00:15:02,257 --> 00:15:04,179
Don't leave me.

260
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:09,328
I need to know this isn't the last time
I am going to see you.

261
00:15:12,763 --> 00:15:14,606
I just love you so much.

262
00:15:20,938 --> 00:15:22,485
I love you, too.

263
00:15:24,942 --> 00:15:26,239
Was that good?

264
00:15:31,324 --> 00:15:34,669
Yeah. Yeah, that was...
That was great.

265
00:15:44,003 --> 00:15:45,846
Production value.

266
00:15:46,172 --> 00:15:47,845
Cary, you put film in the camera, right?

267
00:15:47,845 --> 00:15:48,971
I didn't put it in.

268
00:15:49,175 --> 00:15:52,054
What? Put it in, put it in.
Joe, get the mike ready. Go, go, go.

269
00:15:52,512 --> 00:15:54,435
Get in costume, costume, costume.
Okay, I will.

270
00:15:54,435 --> 00:15:57,768
Joe, help her. Hurry up.
Martin, get that tripod set up.

271
00:15:57,768 --> 00:15:59,022
Preston, get in position.

272
00:15:59,022 --> 00:16:00,444
I will. I have to get the money.

273
00:16:00,444 --> 00:16:02,522
Go. Get these headphones ready.

274
00:16:02,522 --> 00:16:03,860
Martin, you know your lines.

275
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,109
Hurry. Get that camera ready. Go, go.
Shut up.

276
00:16:06,109 --> 00:16:07,614
We will start on Alice
and pan to the train, right?

277
00:16:07,614 --> 00:16:08,990
Oh, God, I hope we don't miss it.

278
00:16:13,241 --> 00:16:14,914
Shut up. I am trying.

279
00:16:14,914 --> 00:16:17,086
Hurry. Get that set up.
Let's go. Positions, positions.

280
00:16:17,086 --> 00:16:20,249
Ready. Start filming.
Be extra loud when the train passes by.

281
00:16:20,581 --> 00:16:23,084
Here we go. And action.

282
00:16:23,668 --> 00:16:26,421
Look, I am going to stay here
and investigate.

283
00:16:26,671 --> 00:16:30,175
I think it'd be safer if you left town
for a couple of days.

284
00:16:30,175 --> 00:16:32,973
John, I don't like it.
This case. These murders.

285
00:16:33,344 --> 00:16:36,018
What do you want me to do,
go to Michigan with you?

286
00:16:36,222 --> 00:16:38,566
Mackinac Island's
beautiful this time of year.

287
00:16:42,228 --> 00:16:45,949
The dead coming back to life?
I think you're in danger.

288
00:16:45,949 --> 00:16:47,195
I don't have a choice.

289
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,743
You do have a choice.

290
00:16:49,068 --> 00:16:50,194
We all do.

291
00:16:53,072 --> 00:16:55,074
John, I have never asked you to stop.

292
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,704
I have never asked you
to give up or walk away.

293
00:16:59,912 --> 00:17:03,116
But I am asking you now.
Please, for me,

294
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,634
just don't go.

295
00:17:05,634 --> 00:17:07,206
Just don't go back.

296
00:17:07,331 --> 00:17:08,738
Don't leave me.

297
00:17:09,046 --> 00:17:12,425
I need to know this isn't the last
time I am going to see you.

298
00:17:14,135 --> 00:17:16,433
I love you so much.
I love you, too.

299
00:17:16,637 --> 00:17:18,560
Guys, watch out.
Joe, what the hell are you

300
00:17:22,435 --> 00:17:24,633
Oh, my God.
Run.

301
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,402
Oh, my God.
Go.

302
00:17:30,776 --> 00:17:32,073
Holy shit.

303
00:17:32,073 --> 00:17:33,279
Go, go, go.

304
00:17:38,451 --> 00:17:39,498
Alice.

305
00:17:39,498 --> 00:17:41,625
Joe, let's go. We got to go.

306
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,633
Keep going.
Are we alive?

307
00:18:09,273 --> 00:18:10,946
I don't want to die.

308
00:18:15,738 --> 00:18:16,785
Oh, my God.

309
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:51,630
Guys.

310
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:54,257
I am okay.

311
00:19:54,545 --> 00:19:56,218
Martin, you okay?

312
00:19:58,215 --> 00:20:00,378
Though I think I am having a heart attack.

313
00:20:00,403 --> 00:20:01,459
And I have a scrape.

314
00:20:01,719 --> 00:20:02,891
Joe!
Oh, my God.

315
00:20:03,137 --> 00:20:04,580
Guys, did you see those explosions?

316
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,027
You guys seen Alice?

317
00:20:06,173 --> 00:20:07,516
Guys, that was unbelievable.

318
00:20:10,478 --> 00:20:11,730
Why did this happen?

319
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,155
Martin, it's going to be okay.

320
00:20:13,155 --> 00:20:15,608
No, it's not, dude. Look at this.

321
00:20:21,405 --> 00:20:23,533
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

322
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,173
What's all that blood?

323
00:20:34,585 --> 00:20:35,741
What's the blood?

324
00:20:36,066 --> 00:20:37,528
Did someone get hurt?

325
00:20:41,425 --> 00:20:43,177
Joe, what are you doing?
Joe, stop.

326
00:20:43,177 --> 00:20:44,512
Don't put your hand under there.

327
00:20:44,512 --> 00:20:45,892
Joe, you don't know what's under there.

328
00:20:45,892 --> 00:20:47,314
Joe.

329
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,313
It's my fake blood.

330
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:50,901
It's fake.

331
00:20:54,563 --> 00:20:55,735
Guys?

332
00:20:56,232 --> 00:20:57,779
Come here. What are these things?
Shit.

333
00:20:57,779 --> 00:21:00,240
No one cares. Look around you.

334
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,117
They look like white Rubik's Cubes,
or something.

335
00:21:02,117 --> 00:21:03,914
I don't think that's what they are.
They don't move.

336
00:21:03,914 --> 00:21:05,332
They're heavy, like metal or something.

337
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:06,909
Yeah.
There's like a billion of them.

338
00:21:06,909 --> 00:21:08,118
What's going on?

339
00:21:08,118 --> 00:21:09,370
Martin, it's going to be okay, all right?

340
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,579
Are you serious?

341
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:13,337
You guys. Get up here.
You can see everything from up here.

342
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:15,834
Joe.

343
00:21:31,392 --> 00:21:32,609
According to my Uncle Seth,

344
00:21:32,609 --> 00:21:35,685
an accident like this is exceptionally rare.

345
00:21:35,985 --> 00:21:37,505
It wasn't an accident.

346
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,402
What?

347
00:21:38,524 --> 00:21:40,822
There was a truck on the train tracks.
Are you serious?

348
00:21:40,822 --> 00:21:42,854
What, like, driving on the tracks?

349
00:21:44,488 --> 00:21:45,660
There.

350
00:21:52,496 --> 00:21:53,998
Oh, my gosh.

351
00:21:54,707 --> 00:21:56,209
How could a pickup truck derail a train, man?

352
00:21:56,209 --> 00:21:57,339
That's impossible.

353
00:21:57,339 --> 00:21:58,635
Obviously, it isn't.

354
00:21:58,635 --> 00:21:59,928
Holy shit.

355
00:22:02,673 --> 00:22:05,426
Oh, my God. I know that truck.

356
00:22:06,093 --> 00:22:07,145
Guys.

357
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:09,896
Is that him?

358
00:22:10,347 --> 00:22:12,349
Yeah. It's him.

359
00:22:13,017 --> 00:22:16,021
Who? It is.
Yeah, for sure.

360
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,863
Who is it?

361
00:22:21,191 --> 00:22:22,534
Dr. Woodward.

362
00:22:22,776 --> 00:22:24,198
Dr. Woodward, the science guy?

363
00:22:24,403 --> 00:22:26,872
Biology.
Honors Biology.

364
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:29,808
I am not in his class.

365
00:22:29,908 --> 00:22:31,703
We know.
Just shut up, Cary.

366
00:22:35,873 --> 00:22:38,547
Remember when Old Man Woodward
took your Electronic Football?

367
00:22:38,876 --> 00:22:41,470
Yeah. He put it in the dungeon
and never gave it back.

368
00:22:41,962 --> 00:22:43,088
The dungeon?

369
00:22:43,088 --> 00:22:45,846
That trailer Woodward keeps
in the school parking lot.

370
00:22:45,846 --> 00:22:47,501
Dr. Woodward?

371
00:22:48,677 --> 00:22:50,020
Dr. Woodward?

372
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,863
Map of the Contiguous United States.

373
00:23:07,112 --> 00:23:08,614
What's the writing?

374
00:23:08,864 --> 00:23:10,036
Dates and times.

375
00:23:10,036 --> 00:23:11,792
Guys, what's this line?

376
00:23:12,368 --> 00:23:14,416
It's a schedule for the train.

377
00:23:15,829 --> 00:23:16,955
What the

378
00:23:16,955 --> 00:23:19,792
He's alive. He's alive.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

379
00:23:19,792 --> 00:23:21,252
Holy shit.

380
00:23:29,218 --> 00:23:30,686
Who are you?

381
00:23:31,553 --> 00:23:34,056
Dr. Woodward, it's me.

382
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:37,234
Charles Kaznyk.
From fourth period.

383
00:23:37,851 --> 00:23:39,899
You have been in an accident.
You're going to be okay.

384
00:23:39,899 --> 00:23:42,753
Back.
Holy shit. Holy shit. Shit.

385
00:23:45,776 --> 00:23:47,249
They will kill you.

386
00:23:49,863 --> 00:23:52,036
Do not speak of this.

387
00:23:52,366 --> 00:23:54,168
Or else you...

388
00:23:56,537 --> 00:23:57,810
and your parents...

389
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,957
will die.

390
00:24:03,794 --> 00:24:05,046
Guys, look.

391
00:24:05,629 --> 00:24:06,972
We shouldn't be here.
Oh, my God.

392
00:24:06,972 --> 00:24:08,549
Go.
Come on.

393
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:10,305
Shit. Let's get the hell out of here.

394
00:24:10,305 --> 00:24:12,011
Holy shit. Run. Shit.

395
00:24:12,386 --> 00:24:14,605
Guys, there are a lot of nails
on the ground. Be careful.

396
00:24:14,605 --> 00:24:15,977
Hurry, come on, guys.

397
00:24:15,977 --> 00:24:17,899
Guys, come on.

398
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,693
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Holy shit.

399
00:24:20,019 --> 00:24:21,362
Grab the film.

400
00:24:23,397 --> 00:24:24,740
Guys, come on.

401
00:24:25,149 --> 00:24:27,368
Move your ass. Let's go. Let's go.

402
00:24:28,527 --> 00:24:30,074
Who's got the bags?
Get in the car.

403
00:24:31,905 --> 00:24:33,077
Get in.

404
00:24:33,866 --> 00:24:35,709
They're getting closer.

405
00:24:41,582 --> 00:24:42,699
Come on.

406
00:24:48,672 --> 00:24:49,719
Anybody get their plates?

407
00:24:49,719 --> 00:24:51,516
I didn't get the plate.
Did you get it?

408
00:24:53,093 --> 00:24:54,265
All clear.

409
00:25:01,393 --> 00:25:03,066
Holy shit. That was insane.

410
00:25:03,066 --> 00:25:04,192
He had a gun.

411
00:25:04,192 --> 00:25:05,397
An actual physical gun.
Oh, shit.

412
00:25:05,397 --> 00:25:08,109
My heart is pounding.
That train could have killed us.

413
00:25:08,109 --> 00:25:09,318
Are you okay?

414
00:25:09,318 --> 00:25:11,574
Oh, shit. No.
My camera's shattered now.

415
00:25:11,574 --> 00:25:13,621
Guys, I have never had
a teacher aim a gun at me.

416
00:25:13,621 --> 00:25:15,370
It's hard enough to drive
without everyone yelling.

417
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:16,541
Guys, keep it down.

418
00:25:17,743 --> 00:25:19,416
You will die. Your parents will die.

419
00:25:19,416 --> 00:25:21,122
Guys, this is not good information.

420
00:25:21,371 --> 00:25:23,373
Oh, shit. The focus ring just fell off.

421
00:25:23,373 --> 00:25:25,050
No one cares about your camera.

422
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:28,470
Guys, am I the only one shaking?
And I am also crying.

423
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,842
We can't tell anyone we were there.

424
00:25:29,842 --> 00:25:31,640
My dad can't find out I took his car.

425
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,762
Do you guys hear me?

426
00:25:32,762 --> 00:25:35,736
It's okay.
We're not saying anything to anyone.

427
00:25:37,805 --> 00:25:40,399
Guys.
We're not saying anything, are we?

428
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:41,521
No.
No.

429
00:25:41,521 --> 00:25:42,772
No.
No.

430
00:25:43,393 --> 00:25:44,485
See?

431
00:25:45,145 --> 00:25:46,567
No one's going to know.

432
00:25:46,897 --> 00:25:48,570
No one's saying anything.

433
00:25:55,864 --> 00:25:57,116
Joe.

434
00:26:00,911 --> 00:26:02,154
Thanks.

435
00:26:03,914 --> 00:26:05,516
I never should have done this.

436
00:26:43,012 --> 00:26:43,624
Joe!

437
00:26:43,949 --> 00:26:44,983
Joe, wake up.

438
00:26:45,956 --> 00:26:47,924
Make sure you let Lucy out, all right?
Okay. I will.

439
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:50,423
What are you going to do?
You going to be with Charles today?

440
00:26:50,423 --> 00:26:51,845
Yeah. I will be with Charles.

441
00:26:51,845 --> 00:26:54,093
All right. I am heading in.
There's something I got to deal with.

442
00:26:54,093 --> 00:26:55,595
Don't forget to get the yard.
I will.

443
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:08,862
Mom, come on.

444
00:27:09,188 --> 00:27:10,405
No. You are not wearing that.

445
00:27:10,405 --> 00:27:12,157
No one in this house is wearing that.

446
00:27:12,157 --> 00:27:14,325
Oh, really?
Compared to Debbie's, these are long.

447
00:27:14,325 --> 00:27:15,448
Listen to your mother.

448
00:27:15,448 --> 00:27:18,201
So, I can't go to Wendy's party or
wear the shorts? Not fair.

449
00:27:18,405 --> 00:27:20,407
Jennifer Anne, not fair is Africa.

450
00:27:20,824 --> 00:27:22,121
Mom's racist.

451
00:27:22,121 --> 00:27:23,619
Do we have any more English muffins?

452
00:27:23,619 --> 00:27:24,874
Why don't you get up and check.

453
00:27:24,874 --> 00:27:26,148
Peg, tell the twins to stop.

454
00:27:26,673 --> 00:27:28,089
I can't, they don't listen.
Morning, Joe.

455
00:27:28,114 --> 00:27:29,189
Good morning, Mr. Kaznyk.

456
00:27:29,291 --> 00:27:31,364
Hey, Joe.
Did you hear about the train crash?

457
00:27:32,294 --> 00:27:34,296
No.
It's on the news.

458
00:27:34,963 --> 00:27:38,638
<i>instead opting to use military personnel,</i>

459
00:27:38,638 --> 00:27:41,971
<i>which for this reporter
only adds to the mystery.</i>

460
00:27:41,971 --> 00:27:45,058
<i>Of course, we will have
much more on this story as it develops.</i>

461
00:27:45,058 --> 00:27:48,565
<i>Coming to you live from Montgomery
County, Channel 14 News...</i>

462
00:27:48,565 --> 00:27:50,317
Can you believe this?

463
00:27:50,317 --> 00:27:51,651
No.

464
00:27:52,231 --> 00:27:54,484
It's on the news, that means it's real.
I know.

465
00:27:54,484 --> 00:27:56,576
<i>Local teacher Thomas Woodward
is still being treated</i>

466
00:27:56,576 --> 00:27:59,906
<i>by Air Force medical personnel after
last night's train derailment.</i>

467
00:27:59,906 --> 00:28:02,741
<i>Woodward apparently fell asleep

468
00:28:02,741 --> 00:28:04,292
<i>which was hit by the speeding train.</i>

469
00:28:04,292 --> 00:28:06,161
This is gross.
Well, how about you clean it up?

470
00:28:06,161 --> 00:28:08,498
That would be a great help.
Thanks so much.

471
00:28:08,498 --> 00:28:12,175
<i>derailment, the largest such
accident in Ohio's history.</i>

00:28:13,502 --> 00:28:16,255
<i>who has taught at Lillian Middle
School for the past six years</i>

474
00:28:16,255 --> 00:28:18,432
Looks like a disaster movie.
Doesn't it?

475
00:28:20,842 --> 00:28:22,185
Oh, my God.

476
00:28:22,185 --> 00:28:23,433
Sit down.

477
00:28:23,433 --> 00:28:25,014
Joe, that's awesome.

478
00:28:26,139 --> 00:28:27,165
What?

479
00:28:27,189 --> 00:28:29,451
We can use it. We can film it.

480
00:28:30,185 --> 00:28:31,687
You want to go back?

481
00:28:31,687 --> 00:28:33,776
Holy shit, that's mint.
Really?

482
00:28:33,776 --> 00:28:34,947
You're a total brain.

483
00:28:34,947 --> 00:28:36,024
We got to go get the camera fixed

484
00:28:36,024 --> 00:28:37,696
and the film developed from last night.
Okay.

485
00:28:37,696 --> 00:28:39,791
I am going to go steal some
money from my mom.

486
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:44,203
If any of the footage is usable
from last night,

487
00:28:44,203 --> 00:28:46,377
that means we need Alice
to play the wife again.

488
00:28:46,702 --> 00:28:48,625
Oh, yeah.
I thought she was really good.

489
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:50,547
Dude, she was mint,
but she's never going to do it.

490
00:28:50,547 --> 00:28:52,007
I think she will.

491
00:28:52,007 --> 00:28:53,800
There's no way.
You heard what she said.

492
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,548
Well, that was before the new scenes, right?

493
00:28:55,548 --> 00:28:57,550
You honestly think she cares
about the scenes?

494
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,888
She was totally wigged.

495
00:28:58,888 --> 00:29:00,474
Yeah, she was. We all were.

496
00:29:00,474 --> 00:29:04,144
Lens is cracked. Focus ring broke.

497
00:29:04,886 --> 00:29:06,229
You think it's fixable?

498
00:29:06,555 --> 00:29:08,057
I think it's cheaper to buy a new one.

499
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:10,413
The camera's busted, man.
It's over.

500
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:11,902
We can use my dad's camera.

501
00:29:11,902 --> 00:29:13,232
It's got some...
<i>Hello?</i>

502
00:29:13,232 --> 00:29:15,701
Hey, Alice. It's Joe Lamb.

503
00:29:16,101 --> 00:29:16,997
<i>Hi.</i>

504
00:29:17,265 --> 00:29:19,468
So, we have some new
scenes for the movie and

505
00:29:19,493 --> 00:29:21,175
Charles and I were hoping you'd be in them.

506
00:29:23,322 --> 00:29:25,745
<i>No. No, I am done with that.</i>

507
00:29:25,745 --> 00:29:28,164
I need this film developed
as soon as possible.

508
00:29:28,164 --> 00:29:29,369
Can you do overnight?

509
00:29:29,703 --> 00:29:31,705
Asshole, no one can do overnight.

510
00:29:33,373 --> 00:29:34,716
You want to buy some pot?

511
00:29:35,709 --> 00:29:38,053
No. No, thank you.

512
00:29:38,587 --> 00:29:40,339
Well, what's the fastest you can do?

513
00:29:40,339 --> 00:29:43,997
I can make it a rush.
You will get your film back in three days.

514
00:29:44,718 --> 00:29:46,516
Hey, what's your sister up to?

515
00:29:46,516 --> 00:29:48,097
The hot one, not the other one.

516
00:29:48,889 --> 00:29:49,936
I don't know.

517
00:29:49,936 --> 00:29:51,900
<i>I am watching the crash on the news.</i>

518
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,773
Yeah. I saw it.
<i>I should go.</i>

519
00:29:53,973 --> 00:29:56,522
Wait. Hold on. Let me come over
and I will bring the scenes

520
00:29:56,522 --> 00:29:58,113
<i>No, no.</i>
I will be right there.

521
00:29:58,138 --> 00:29:59,228
It's a good idea.
<i>Don't. Don't come.</i>

522
00:29:59,404 --> 00:30:02,365
I don't care what Charles wants.
I said no on the phone.

523
00:30:02,365 --> 00:30:04,538
You totally did, I know that's true, but...

524
00:30:04,538 --> 00:30:06,536
But now you're at my house.

525
00:30:06,782 --> 00:30:07,874
I am. Which...

526
00:30:07,874 --> 00:30:10,702
I don't understand how you guys can
keep working on that stupid movie.

527
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,957
You should go.

528
00:30:26,426 --> 00:30:27,669
What's this?

529
00:30:29,262 --> 00:30:31,264
He was just inviting me to a party.

530
00:30:32,265 --> 00:30:34,108
Yeah?
Good morning, Mr. Dainard.

531
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:38,272
She's not going to your party.

532
00:30:38,772 --> 00:30:39,819
Yes, Sir.

533
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:50,283
You. Get out of here.

534
00:30:50,826 --> 00:30:53,295
You go home and you don't come back here.

535
00:30:55,664 --> 00:30:57,257
I don't want to see you.

536
00:30:59,751 --> 00:31:00,923
Ally, come inside.

537
00:31:08,009 --> 00:31:09,932
Ally, I am in the kitchen.

538
00:31:12,848 --> 00:31:14,191
I will do it.

539
00:31:18,019 --> 00:31:19,191
What?

540
00:31:25,152 --> 00:31:26,825
Cut. That was mint.

541
00:31:27,654 --> 00:31:30,874
Oh, my God. With the train So good.

542
00:31:30,874 --> 00:31:32,538
Joe, reload the cap gun.
Okay.

543
00:31:32,538 --> 00:31:35,037
We will shoot another angle next.
Alice, that was mint.

544
00:31:35,037 --> 00:31:36,960
Martin, go a little faster next time.

545
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:39,549
I will try, Charles, but I am still
crying about last night, man.

546
00:31:39,549 --> 00:31:40,796
I feel like I am crazy.

547
00:31:40,796 --> 00:31:43,049
Guys, did it really look good? My death?

548
00:31:43,049 --> 00:31:45,218
Dude, it looked awesome.
That was magic.

549
00:31:45,964 --> 00:31:47,716
What do you think happened?

550
00:31:48,842 --> 00:31:50,515
You mean why he crashed the train?

551
00:31:52,012 --> 00:31:53,855
I just got a horrible feeling.

552
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,738
Dude, what are you doing?

553
00:32:14,576 --> 00:32:16,704
That whole thing's an Air Force train.

554
00:32:17,037 --> 00:32:18,109
What?

555
00:32:18,413 --> 00:32:20,086
I make models. Like, plastic ones.

556
00:32:20,086 --> 00:32:21,504
You know, glue them, paint them...

557
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,755
And he's not embarrassed by that.

558
00:32:22,755 --> 00:32:24,423
Look who's talking, Math Camp.

559
00:32:24,423 --> 00:32:26,672
Thanks. Can I have a coffee, please?
Cream on the side.

560
00:32:26,672 --> 00:32:28,098
Sure.
He's so sophisticated.

561
00:32:28,098 --> 00:32:30,593
Shut up. I like coffee.
No one likes coffee.

562
00:32:30,593 --> 00:32:33,436
Air Force trains, even the models,
have these hooks...

563
00:32:33,436 --> 00:32:36,352
They do. For when the
trains are loaded on the transport ships.

564
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:38,024
Every car in that crash had hooks.

565
00:32:38,024 --> 00:32:39,942
Joe, would you stop
talking about it, all right?

566
00:32:39,942 --> 00:32:41,019
Wait, guys.

567
00:32:41,019 --> 00:32:43,525
Am I the only one who doesn't
understand what any of this means?

568
00:32:43,525 --> 00:32:44,777
Probably, Smartin.
Cary, shut up.

569
00:32:45,065 --> 00:32:46,442
You shut up.
I don't like it when you call me that.

570
00:32:46,442 --> 00:32:48,118
I am sorry, Smartin.
Let's just go cry about it.

571
00:32:48,401 --> 00:32:50,403
Dr. Woodward had that map.

572
00:32:50,737 --> 00:32:52,785
He drove onto the train tracks.

573
00:32:52,785 --> 00:32:55,125
Maybe there was something
he wanted to...

574
00:32:55,125 --> 00:32:57,370
To destroy, yeah.
My God, will you guys just shut up?

575
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:59,796
Maybe he was just sick of being old
and wanted to kill himself.

576
00:32:59,796 --> 00:33:01,039
That's a dumb idea.

577
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,374
He had a gun. Why not use that?

578
00:33:02,374 --> 00:33:05,383
There are infinitely more effective
ways to commit suicide.

579
00:33:05,708 --> 00:33:06,919
Pills, hanging...

580
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,797
Pussy. Stop taking the fries away.

581
00:33:09,047 --> 00:33:10,970
I ordered these for a reason.
Excuse me.

582
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:13,472
Could we get another order of fries?
Because my friend here is fat.

583
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:16,642
Funny, chompers. At least I don't
have to use a booster seat.

584
00:33:16,642 --> 00:33:18,432
You could jump from a building.

585
00:33:18,432 --> 00:33:19,649
Or fall down some stairs.

586
00:33:19,649 --> 00:33:21,109
Well, that's not really effective.

587
00:33:21,393 --> 00:33:24,067
If it's the Air Force, what would
the Air Force have on the train?

588
00:33:24,067 --> 00:33:25,847
Jesus, shut up about it.

589
00:33:26,439 --> 00:33:29,443
You heard what Old Man Woodward
said, we can't talk about this.

590
00:33:29,734 --> 00:33:32,157
Joe, seriously.
Do you really want to take a chance

591
00:33:32,157 --> 00:33:33,952
that something could happen to your dad, too?

592
00:33:42,956 --> 00:33:44,503
All right, easy, easy.

593
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:51,013
It's loaded. Move out.
Yes, sir.

594
00:33:54,509 --> 00:33:57,763
Yes, Deputy. I am told this crash has
caused a whole mess of confusion.

595
00:33:57,763 --> 00:33:59,519
Well, as you can expect,
the local authorities

596
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,021
are trying to figure out just what
happened, as well as how to help you.

597
00:34:02,021 --> 00:34:04,361
it's all under control.
It will be a very fast clean-up.

598
00:34:04,361 --> 00:34:06,442
Colonel, there isn't anything that
I should know, is there?

599
00:34:06,442 --> 00:34:08,273
Not that I can think of, Deputy.

600
00:34:08,273 --> 00:34:10,609
I understand you have
concerns about our cargo.

601
00:34:10,609 --> 00:34:12,444
Well, I'd like to see that manifest, yes.

602
00:34:12,694 --> 00:34:14,196
Well, that's not going to be possible.

603
00:34:14,196 --> 00:34:15,864
Colonel, I have got a lot
of people in my town

604
00:34:15,864 --> 00:34:17,832
that are going to want to know
what's taking place.

605
00:34:18,325 --> 00:34:19,622
Which town is that?

606
00:34:19,622 --> 00:34:20,793
Lillian.

607
00:34:22,787 --> 00:34:24,710
Deputy, if you're asking me if we
had any dangerous property

608
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:27,835
on board this train,
I can assure you the answer is, No.

609
00:34:28,335 --> 00:34:29,407
Colonel.

610
00:34:29,711 --> 00:34:30,803
Excuse me.

611
00:34:42,223 --> 00:34:43,315
They gave me the run-around for two hours

612
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:44,734
before they allowed me to talk to anyone.

613
00:34:44,734 --> 00:34:46,728
I'd say they have had
their hands full, Jack.

614
00:34:46,728 --> 00:34:48,981
Nelec, the Colonel,
refused to show me the manifest.

615
00:34:48,981 --> 00:34:51,817
He told me they're carrying mostly
airplane parts. I don't buy that.

616
00:34:51,817 --> 00:34:54,744
It's Air Force, Jack.
Airplane parts sort of make sense.

617
00:34:55,028 --> 00:34:57,247
Sheriff, I am telling you,
there's something else going on.

618
00:34:57,247 --> 00:34:59,495
They're taking molds of tire tracks.

619
00:34:59,495 --> 00:35:00,917
Why would they be doing that?

620
00:35:00,917 --> 00:35:02,164
Who would they be looking for?

621
00:35:02,164 --> 00:35:04,917
And they're packaging these weird
little cubes into these crates.

622
00:35:04,917 --> 00:35:06,085
Weird little cubes?

623
00:35:06,085 --> 00:35:09,168
Yeah, they're loading them onto these
red trucks. There are dozens of them.

624
00:35:09,168 --> 00:35:11,252
Sheriff, I think you need
to go check it out.

625
00:35:11,252 --> 00:35:12,758
And I think you need to take a break.

626
00:35:13,755 --> 00:35:16,008
Jack, I have been telling you this
since Elizabeth.

627
00:35:16,008 --> 00:35:18,435
You're a good deputy,
but you need to take a vacation.

628
00:35:19,177 --> 00:35:21,271
Go home. Take off the uniform.

629
00:35:21,271 --> 00:35:23,186
Go fishing. Give your son a hug.

630
00:35:38,446 --> 00:35:41,191
Hey, Breen, I am not sure Edie's paying
you to listen to the radio.

631
00:35:43,785 --> 00:35:44,957
Breen.

632
00:35:45,954 --> 00:35:47,297
Hey, Sheriff.

633
00:35:47,297 --> 00:35:48,581
What's that?

634
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:51,043
Walkman. It's like a stereo.

635
00:35:51,043 --> 00:35:52,469
Play your own cassette tapes.

636
00:35:52,794 --> 00:35:53,795
You want to try?

637
00:35:53,795 --> 00:35:55,547
I don't think so.

638
00:35:55,547 --> 00:35:58,634
Kids walking around with their own
stereos, just what we need.

639
00:35:59,467 --> 00:36:00,810
It's a slippery slope, my friend.

640
00:36:01,261 --> 00:36:02,604
Yes, Sir.

641
00:37:42,987 --> 00:37:44,039
Sheriff?

642
00:37:50,829 --> 00:37:51,881
Sheriff?

643
00:38:43,631 --> 00:38:45,804
You know, in scene. Where is it?

644
00:38:46,968 --> 00:38:48,311
Where'd you learn to do this?

645
00:38:48,636 --> 00:38:50,309
Mostly the Dick Smith
Monster Make-up Handbook.

646
00:38:50,309 --> 00:38:52,808
Hey, Joe. We need some more
footage of the train crash.

647
00:38:52,808 --> 00:38:55,560
Obviously.
You know that train model you just made?

648
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,816
Your cargo train.
I want to blow it up and film it.

649
00:38:57,816 --> 00:38:59,152
Let me blow it up.

650
00:39:00,648 --> 00:39:02,321
Yeah. Sure.

651
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:03,822
Mint.
Gnarly. Yes.

652
00:39:05,486 --> 00:39:06,658
Here, take this, will you?

653
00:39:08,323 --> 00:39:10,322
It's fine.
They can blow it up.

654
00:39:11,047 --> 00:39:12,352
I don't care.

655
00:39:14,621 --> 00:39:16,464
You want to see it?
The train?

656
00:39:16,464 --> 00:39:17,586
My train model.

657
00:39:17,611 --> 00:39:19,032
The train I made.

658
00:39:21,177 --> 00:39:22,341
Dude, that's bitching.

659
00:39:22,341 --> 00:39:23,763
Dude, that's like the third time it's happened.

660
00:39:23,763 --> 00:39:24,930
What the hell?

661
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:27,179
So how am I supposed to be a zombie?

662
00:39:30,678 --> 00:39:34,353
Pretty much just be a lifeless ghoul,
with no soul. Dead eyes.

663
00:39:34,682 --> 00:39:35,351
Scary.

664
00:39:36,176 --> 00:39:38,237
Did you ever have Mrs. Mullin?
For English?

665
00:39:38,262 --> 00:39:39,215
Yeah.
Yeah.

666
00:39:39,437 --> 00:39:41,815
Kind of like her,
but hungry for human flesh.

667
00:39:42,023 --> 00:39:44,196
Like she wants to turn
somebody into a zombie.

668
00:39:44,196 --> 00:39:46,082
Because that's kind of what zombies do.

669
00:39:59,874 --> 00:40:01,502
Oh, my God, yeah.
That's really good.

670
00:40:20,645 --> 00:40:21,988
Not bad.

671
00:40:21,988 --> 00:40:23,789
Really?
Really.

672
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,919
Careful. There was a gas spill.

673
00:40:35,919 --> 00:40:38,338
I don't even know how much fuel I lost.

674
00:40:38,338 --> 00:40:40,336
You don't seem to be asking
very many questions.

675
00:40:40,336 --> 00:40:42,088
Give the man some time, Mr. Blakely.

676
00:40:42,088 --> 00:40:43,422
He's only a deputy, he's not the Sheriff.

677
00:40:43,422 --> 00:40:44,756
Doesn't matter.

678
00:40:45,253 --> 00:40:48,257
I think this is most likely a bear attack.

679
00:40:48,257 --> 00:40:51,097
Security cameras showed nothing.
Someone had erased

680
00:40:51,097 --> 00:40:53,348
Vicky, you heard
from Sheriff Pruitt this morning?

681
00:40:53,348 --> 00:40:55,271
<i>Negative. Still no word.</i>

682
00:40:59,934 --> 00:41:02,528
Vicky, you need to have Dayton send
a C.S. unit out to Edie's,

683
00:41:02,528 --> 00:41:04,776
and you put an A.P.B.
out on the Sheriff and Breen Haskell,

684
00:41:04,776 --> 00:41:07,696
and send units over to their houses
immediately. You copy all that?

685
00:41:07,696 --> 00:41:12,121
<i>Copy. And, Jack,
we're getting a lot of unusual calls.</i>

686
00:41:12,613 --> 00:41:14,115
What kinds of unusual calls?

687
00:41:14,741 --> 00:41:16,459
I have never seen
this kind of thing before.

688
00:41:16,459 --> 00:41:18,127
I mean, what the hell
am I supposed to do?

689
00:41:18,127 --> 00:41:21,464
The insurance company guy
thought I was joking with him.

690
00:41:21,464 --> 00:41:23,462
Look at my Bonneville over here.

691
00:41:23,462 --> 00:41:25,376
They'd have to have
a winch to take that out.

692
00:41:25,376 --> 00:41:27,713
You been having any
troubles with anyone lately, Izzy?

693
00:41:28,212 --> 00:41:30,715
Well, I was thinking
you should talk to Louis Dainard.

694
00:41:31,424 --> 00:41:34,553
Yeah. I didn't help him out
with financing last year,

695
00:41:34,553 --> 00:41:38,139
and I wouldn't be surprised if this was
some sort of sick retribution.

696
00:41:38,139 --> 00:41:39,641
My generator is missing.

697
00:41:39,641 --> 00:41:40,816
The phones aren't working.

698
00:41:40,816 --> 00:41:42,235
My dog's gone. Disappeared.

699
00:41:42,235 --> 00:41:43,653
The phones won't produce a signal.

700
00:41:43,653 --> 00:41:45,147
Call the station and file a report.

701
00:41:45,147 --> 00:41:47,823
I will have someone come out and take
care of each one of you. Okay?

702
00:42:08,503 --> 00:42:09,976
Lucy.

703
00:42:12,965 --> 00:42:14,212
Lucy.

704
00:42:43,538 --> 00:42:45,290
I got four guys on this case.

705
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:46,465
People don't feel safe around here.

706
00:42:46,465 --> 00:42:47,793
You know why? Because they're not.

707
00:42:47,793 --> 00:42:48,967
We need to get the National Guard.

708
00:42:48,967 --> 00:42:50,465
Air Force hasn't answered a damn question.

709
00:42:50,465 --> 00:42:52,297
They have got trucks over
at Woodward's house.

710
00:42:52,297 --> 00:42:54,223
Now, Ben heard they were looking
for Woodward's research.

711
00:42:54,223 --> 00:42:55,299
Research? What the hell?

712
00:42:55,299 --> 00:42:57,477
Shotgun in one of those trucks,
he had, like, a scanner.

713
00:42:57,477 --> 00:42:58,553
Like a Geiger counter.

714
00:42:58,553 --> 00:43:00,305
They're saying it's just clean
up at the crash site, too,

715
00:43:00,305 --> 00:43:02,061
but they're taking molds of tire tracks.

716
00:43:02,061 --> 00:43:04,734
That means they're looking for
someone. Now what does that mean?

717
00:43:08,813 --> 00:43:10,315
Have you seen Lucy anywhere?

718
00:43:11,065 --> 00:43:13,067
No. I am sure she's around somewhere.

719
00:43:13,067 --> 00:43:15,245
I put a couple of slices
in the fridge for you there.

720
00:43:16,045 --> 00:43:17,360
I ate those.

721
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,662
Sorry, kid.
Yeah, no problem. I will find something.

722
00:43:20,662 --> 00:43:22,084
Hey.
You got to be kidding.

723
00:43:24,912 --> 00:43:26,255
Pick that up, will you?

724
00:43:28,833 --> 00:43:30,676
Hey, Vicky,
you got power down at the station?

725
00:43:30,676 --> 00:43:32,503
<i>On and off And Brook County's in the dark.</i>

726
00:43:32,503 --> 00:43:35,261
Do me a favor and get Water & Power
out there right now, will you?

727
00:43:35,261 --> 00:43:38,427
So, the Air Force is looking for a car.
Alice's dad's car.

728
00:43:38,427 --> 00:43:41,346
They're taking tire prints
from the crash site. Over.

729
00:43:41,346 --> 00:43:42,772
I don't want to hear about it.

730
00:43:42,772 --> 00:43:44,019
This is what I have been talking about.

731
00:43:44,019 --> 00:43:45,771
They could be monitoring us right now.

732
00:43:45,771 --> 00:43:48,777
Jesus, shut up. Over.

733
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,864
And the military is at Woodward's
house looking for his research.

734
00:43:51,864 --> 00:43:53,191
Whatever that means.

735
00:43:53,191 --> 00:43:54,696
You cannot flake out on me and be a dick.

736
00:43:54,696 --> 00:43:56,618
Are you going to come and
help me tomorrow or not?

737
00:43:56,861 --> 00:43:58,784
I need you to make Alice a zombie again.

738
00:43:58,784 --> 00:44:00,456
Okay. I will do the make-up.

739
00:44:01,032 --> 00:44:02,409
<i>Over.</i>

740
00:44:06,537 --> 00:44:09,016
<i>The cables are gone.
All the poles are empty.</i>

741
00:44:09,416 --> 00:44:11,213
<i>Same thing over here in Rose Hill.</i>

742
00:44:11,213 --> 00:44:13,345
<i>Somebody took the damn wires down.</i>

743
00:44:13,545 --> 00:44:15,221
<i>Holy shit.</i>

744
00:44:15,463 --> 00:44:17,416
<i>Hey, Rooney, you got anything in Lillian?</i>

745
00:44:17,716 --> 00:44:19,300
<i>Hey, Rooney, you copy?</i>

746
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,393
We got a half mile of copper missing.

747
00:44:21,886 --> 00:44:23,433
Lines are back up at M-38.

748
00:44:23,763 --> 00:44:25,982
<i>Truck 14, Rooney's out at the junkyard.</i>

749
00:44:25,982 --> 00:44:27,650
<i>I will give you an update
when I hear back.</i>

750
00:45:40,381 --> 00:45:41,974
<i>I want to know who took them.</i>

751
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:43,802
<i>Twenty microwaves</i>

752
00:45:44,552 --> 00:45:46,646
<i>gone from my inventory.</i>

753
00:45:46,971 --> 00:45:48,894
<i>Everywhere you look,
things are going missing.</i>

754
00:45:49,181 --> 00:45:51,730
<i>We have got trains crashing,
people vanishing.</i>

755
00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:53,903
<i>Belmont County's without power.</i>

756
00:45:53,903 --> 00:45:55,734
<i>You know what this feels like to me?</i>

757
00:45:55,734 --> 00:45:57,565
<i>This feels like a Russian invasion.</i>

758
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:02,073
<i>Debbie, I don't think
that the Russians have anything to do</i>

759
00:46:02,073 --> 00:46:03,746
<i>with what's going on in town.</i>

760
00:46:03,746 --> 00:46:05,991
<i>But I am calling the curfew
because of these exact concerns.</i>

761
00:46:05,991 --> 00:46:08,667
<i>Unless you can tell me who's been
messing around with our stuff,</i>

762
00:46:08,667 --> 00:46:10,245
<i>I say it's the Soviets.</i>

763
00:46:11,245 --> 00:46:14,419
<i>I like you, Jack,
but we need Sheriff Pruitt back.</i>

764
00:46:15,207 --> 00:46:17,585
<i>We have got good people
working on that.</i>

765
00:46:18,252 --> 00:46:19,378
<i>Mr. McCandless.</i>

766
00:46:23,424 --> 00:46:25,677
<i>Since Wednesday morning,
my ham radio is a mess.</i>

767
00:46:26,927 --> 00:46:29,021
<i>Some frequencies which I like to scan,</i>

768
00:46:29,722 --> 00:46:33,522
<i>I am hearing military chatter,
but it's distorted.</i>

769
00:46:33,522 --> 00:46:35,603
<i>And I don't know what it is.
Have you heard that?</i>

770
00:46:35,603 --> 00:46:38,026
<i>Mr. McCandless, can I have a word
with you in private, please?</i>

771
00:46:38,439 --> 00:46:40,612
It was like having my radio hijacked.

772
00:46:40,941 --> 00:46:42,033
I am sure that must be very annoying.

773
00:46:42,033 --> 00:46:43,702
You don't know
those frequencies offhand, do you?

774
00:46:43,702 --> 00:46:45,951
Sure I do. 13-2-0-1

775
00:46:47,031 --> 00:46:48,704
Patty, why don't you get
in touch with Vicky.

776
00:46:48,704 --> 00:46:49,955
Hey, Dave, you seen Milner?

777
00:46:49,955 --> 00:46:51,123
No, sir. I haven't.

778
00:46:51,123 --> 00:46:52,540
Jack, there's a huge sinkhole by my garage.

779
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:53,792
It sunk almost a foot.
I will take care of that.

780
00:46:53,792 --> 00:46:55,331
Hey, Tom! Tom!

781
00:46:55,656 --> 00:46:56,757
You seen Milner?

782
00:46:56,757 --> 00:46:58,517
Have you tried his office?

783
00:46:59,126 --> 00:47:00,218
Have I tried his office?

784
00:47:00,218 --> 00:47:02,547
What are you going to do about the power?
It's been out for two days.

785
00:47:04,215 --> 00:47:05,458
Hey, Rosko.

786
00:47:06,384 --> 00:47:08,227
Rosko. I need you
to get every radio we have

787
00:47:08,227 --> 00:47:09,303
and you tune them to those frequencies.

788
00:47:09,303 --> 00:47:10,475
Understand?
No.

789
00:47:10,475 --> 00:47:11,646
Hey, Milner.
Yeah.

790
00:47:11,646 --> 00:47:13,641
Don't you have a radio scanner
with a descrambler?

791
00:47:13,641 --> 00:47:15,226
A voice inverter, yeah, at home.
Whatever. Get it.

792
00:47:15,226 --> 00:47:16,902
Bring it down here and set it up
for me. Would you please?

793
00:47:16,902 --> 00:47:18,069
Sure thing.
Jack, what is this?

794
00:47:18,069 --> 00:47:20,318
I think the Air Force
is using unassigned channels..

795
00:47:20,318 --> 00:47:23,318
Hey. He was at my house yesterday
morning. You aware of that?

796
00:47:23,318 --> 00:47:25,324
We brought him in for the car lot
and other stuff. He's clean.

797
00:47:25,324 --> 00:47:29,290
Well, I'd appreciate it if you'd inform
your son that my house is off-limits.

798
00:47:29,824 --> 00:47:31,826
And so is my daughter.

799
00:47:36,122 --> 00:47:38,466
I think the make-up was better yesterday.

800
00:47:38,916 --> 00:47:40,418
No, it's good.

801
00:47:41,419 --> 00:47:42,671
I think it looks good.

802
00:47:44,171 --> 00:47:45,343
I should have cleaned up my room.

803
00:47:50,344 --> 00:47:52,312
Did you make all these models?

804
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:54,349
Yeah. Yeah.

805
00:47:54,774 --> 00:47:57,256
That one is the Hunchback
of Notre Dame.

806
00:47:57,856 --> 00:48:00,776
We watched that one on TV.

807
00:48:08,154 --> 00:48:10,998
This is the train they want to destroy.

808
00:48:11,866 --> 00:48:13,118
Looks real.

809
00:48:14,368 --> 00:48:16,041
It looks so old.

810
00:48:16,495 --> 00:48:18,497
Yeah, that's dry brush technique.

811
00:48:20,541 --> 00:48:22,333
It's when there's a coat of paint.

812
00:48:22,558 --> 00:48:25,713
and then you put something
like Euro Gray over it.

813
00:48:25,713 --> 00:48:27,181
Euro Gray?

814
00:48:27,506 --> 00:48:30,885
Oh, my God, there's like 14 different grays.
It gets crazy.

815
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:39,067
What was that necklace?

816
00:48:39,393 --> 00:48:41,746
The one you were holding
at the train crash.

817
00:48:42,146 --> 00:48:43,321
Was it your mom's?

818
00:48:46,734 --> 00:48:49,203
My dad gave it to her the day I was born.

819
00:48:50,196 --> 00:48:51,573
She wears it all the time.

820
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:53,741
Well, used to.

821
00:48:54,033 --> 00:48:55,059
And...

822
00:48:58,412 --> 00:49:00,915
It was bad how she died and...

823
00:49:01,582 --> 00:49:03,175
but my dad got it back.

824
00:49:07,421 --> 00:49:09,423
Guys, what the hell?
No one knew where you were.

825
00:49:09,757 --> 00:49:10,849
We're here.

826
00:49:10,849 --> 00:49:12,051
You got to play the soldier.

827
00:49:12,259 --> 00:49:13,431
I thought you were calling Evan.

828
00:49:13,719 --> 00:49:15,266
Evan blew us off. He's a pussy.

829
00:49:17,223 --> 00:49:18,349
Excuse me.

830
00:49:18,349 --> 00:49:19,524
It's okay.

831
00:49:19,524 --> 00:49:21,443
You got to do it. You're the only one.

832
00:49:21,443 --> 00:49:23,362
Well, what the hell you mean they
found my dog in Brookville?

833
00:49:23,362 --> 00:49:24,780
That's another county over.

834
00:49:25,272 --> 00:49:27,946
Lucy. That's where she is.
I mean, we have got nearly 30 calls

835
00:49:27,946 --> 00:49:29,277
from people who found local dogs,

836
00:49:29,277 --> 00:49:31,704
but the thing is the calls coming in aren't local.

837
00:49:33,948 --> 00:49:37,748
It's like they all just ran away
in every direction.

838
00:49:38,577 --> 00:49:40,796
This isn't like her,
she just doesn't disappear.

839
00:49:40,796 --> 00:49:43,208
Okay, okay, calm down.
Just tell me what she looks like.

840
00:49:43,208 --> 00:49:45,793
She's got dark hair. It was in rollers.
Do you know what rollers are?

841
00:49:45,793 --> 00:49:47,712
Yes, I know what rollers are.
Okay, so...

842
00:49:47,712 --> 00:49:48,767
Hang on.

843
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:52,474
<i>Negative, unable to recover data.</i>

844
00:49:52,925 --> 00:49:54,097
That's definitely Air Force.

845
00:49:54,301 --> 00:49:55,723
Yeah, it's Air Force, but what does it mean?

846
00:49:55,723 --> 00:49:58,226
What are they doing
transmitting on these frequencies?

847
00:49:58,226 --> 00:49:59,477
Maybe it's not even Air Force.

848
00:49:59,477 --> 00:50:00,895
I bet you five bucks it's Air Force.

849
00:50:00,895 --> 00:50:02,227
Five bucks?
Yeah.

850
00:50:02,227 --> 00:50:05,483
<i>We're going to need units to prepare
for Operation Walking Distance.</i>

851
00:50:05,813 --> 00:50:07,156
What did he say? Operation what?

852
00:50:07,481 --> 00:50:08,824
Walking Distance.

853
00:50:09,733 --> 00:50:10,734
What's this?

854
00:50:10,734 --> 00:50:12,820
He worked at Romero Chemical.

855
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:14,826
Found out some things the company was doing.

856
00:50:14,826 --> 00:50:18,334
And after what you told me last night at
the bar, I thought you should know.

857
00:50:19,785 --> 00:50:21,583
Are we going to get in trouble
for being here?

858
00:50:21,583 --> 00:50:22,834
Production value.

859
00:50:22,834 --> 00:50:24,252
Stop talking about production value.

860
00:50:24,252 --> 00:50:25,583
I think the Air Force is going to kill us.

861
00:50:25,583 --> 00:50:27,509
Cary.
Don't cover my mouth.

862
00:50:27,509 --> 00:50:29,007
We just made this discovery today.

863
00:50:29,007 --> 00:50:30,508
You understand this is top secret?

864
00:50:30,508 --> 00:50:31,589
Of course.

865
00:50:31,589 --> 00:50:33,515
I would never have given
you this information

866
00:50:33,515 --> 00:50:35,184
unless we had worked together in Vietnam.

867
00:50:35,184 --> 00:50:37,595
Those were hard times.
I'd rather not talk about it.

868
00:50:37,595 --> 00:50:38,933
Understood.

869
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:41,103
You're a good friend.
You, too.

870
00:50:42,224 --> 00:50:43,567
Nothing so far.

871
00:50:43,892 --> 00:50:45,109
How much more is there?

872
00:50:45,109 --> 00:50:47,028
About 60 more boxes in the basement.

873
00:50:47,028 --> 00:50:48,860
What, more tax returns?

874
00:50:49,189 --> 00:50:50,441
It's here somewhere.

875
00:50:50,441 --> 00:50:53,368
We will find it. If not,
Woodward will tell us where it is.

876
00:50:53,694 --> 00:50:55,196
What the hell is that?

877
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,372
Joe.

878
00:51:02,369 --> 00:51:03,546
Hey, Mr. Lamb.

879
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:06,382
Get in the car.

880
00:51:12,046 --> 00:51:14,094
Mr. Lamb, that's your camera,

881
00:51:14,094 --> 00:51:16,057
but, technically, that's my film.

882
00:51:26,518 --> 00:51:28,316
I would like
to help you out, Deputy, I really would,

883
00:51:28,316 --> 00:51:30,193
but we operate on a need-to-know basis.

884
00:51:30,193 --> 00:51:31,569
Why are your trucks sweeping the town?

885
00:51:31,569 --> 00:51:33,033
We will be out of your way shortly.

886
00:51:33,033 --> 00:51:36,078
All right, then I am sure you won't
mind me contacting D.C.

887
00:51:36,362 --> 00:51:38,285
Talk to some friends about
Walking Distance.

888
00:51:41,784 --> 00:51:43,081
All right, we will do it that way.

889
00:51:44,078 --> 00:51:44,979
Deputy.

890
00:51:45,204 --> 00:51:46,275
Let's talk.

891
00:51:46,747 --> 00:51:48,090
Just not here.

892
00:51:58,258 --> 00:52:00,932
This is new, all of this,
for the both of us.

893
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,196
Dealing with anything.

894
00:52:03,421 --> 00:52:04,347
Just us.

895
00:52:04,431 --> 00:52:07,935
So, I am going to make this
as simple and as clear as I can.

896
00:52:08,143 --> 00:52:09,941
You're not friends with Alice Dainard.

897
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:12,628
When I say No,
I don't mean Maybe.

898
00:52:13,053 --> 00:52:14,470
I don't mean Yes.

899
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,117
I mean No.

900
00:52:16,443 --> 00:52:18,161
I have known
Louis Dainard for a lot of years.

901
00:52:18,946 --> 00:52:20,289
He's been nothing but trouble.

902
00:52:20,656 --> 00:52:23,079
Your mother used to say
he's not such a bad guy.

903
00:52:23,079 --> 00:52:25,126
He just needs a chance, that he was sad.

904
00:52:25,619 --> 00:52:26,791
Well, I tried to be good to him.

905
00:52:27,162 --> 00:52:28,789
And I can't, not anymore.

906
00:52:30,416 --> 00:52:33,010
I will not allow him
or his daughter in this house.

907
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:35,221
I will not allow you
to spend time with her,

908
00:52:35,221 --> 00:52:38,265
doing projects or whatever
it is that you do. That's it.

909
00:52:38,265 --> 00:52:40,013
I hope we're clear on that.

910
00:52:42,428 --> 00:52:43,875
We're not clear.

911
00:52:44,972 --> 00:52:46,064
What'd you say?

912
00:52:46,064 --> 00:52:47,187
We're not clear.

913
00:52:47,187 --> 00:52:48,809
You and I aren't clear about anything.

914
00:52:49,143 --> 00:52:50,486
We couldn't be less clear.

915
00:52:50,486 --> 00:52:53,526
Just because Mom died doesn't mean
you know anything about me.

916
00:52:53,526 --> 00:52:54,819
You don't.

917
00:52:54,819 --> 00:52:56,934
You don't know anything
about Alice, either.

918
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:57,906
She's kind.

919
00:52:57,906 --> 00:52:59,111
We're not going to have
this discussion right now.

920
00:52:59,111 --> 00:53:01,367
She's nice to me.
I don't care what she is.

921
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:05,539
Her father is an irresponsible,
selfish son of a bitch.

922
00:53:06,952 --> 00:53:09,171
You listen to me.
I have got 12,000 people in this town

923
00:53:09,171 --> 00:53:10,665
who are scared out of their mind.

924
00:53:10,665 --> 00:53:12,762
They have got one person to rely on.

925
00:53:13,167 --> 00:53:15,595
It used to be someone else,
but now it's just me.

926
00:54:56,562 --> 00:54:57,609
Move, move.

927
00:54:57,609 --> 00:54:58,730
Let's go. Move.

928
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:01,533
<i>Deputy, drop your weapons.
Put your hands on the car</i>

929
00:55:01,533 --> 00:55:03,030
I am here to see Colonel Nelec.

930
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:05,112
He told me to meet him here.

931
00:55:05,112 --> 00:55:07,552
<i>You're under military arrest.
Drop your weapons.</i>

932
00:55:07,823 --> 00:55:09,450
Where's Nelec?

933
00:55:11,618 --> 00:55:14,292
I don't want any more trouble, do you?

934
00:55:17,958 --> 00:55:21,428
We have been going through your
belongings, looking for evidence.

935
00:55:21,428 --> 00:55:23,795
What you knew.
How you knew it.

936
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,498
Who else might know.

937
00:55:34,516 --> 00:55:36,143
I remember you in the lab.

938
00:55:36,476 --> 00:55:38,353
And I recall
we didn't always see eye to eye,

939
00:55:38,353 --> 00:55:41,152
but that is no
excuse for doing what you did here.

940
00:55:41,815 --> 00:55:46,116
So, in the spirit of moving forward
and avoiding more trouble,

941
00:55:46,116 --> 00:55:48,822
why don't you just
tell me where you put your research

942
00:55:48,822 --> 00:55:50,290
and who else knows about it.

943
00:55:50,532 --> 00:55:53,461
I know you had someone document
the crash that night.

944
00:55:53,661 --> 00:55:55,829
Tell me who that was
and I will help you.

945
00:55:56,496 --> 00:55:57,964
I swear to God on my mother's life,

946
00:55:57,964 --> 00:56:01,010
if you help us now,
we will take care of you.

947
00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:06,049
I have seen what happens, Mr. Nelec,

948
00:56:07,883 --> 00:56:09,009
when you take care of people.

949
00:56:09,009 --> 00:56:10,181
It is mine.

950
00:56:10,181 --> 00:56:11,804
He is mine.

951
00:56:12,387 --> 00:56:14,856
I am going to bait him and catch him.

952
00:56:15,223 --> 00:56:18,022
He's in me, you know.

953
00:56:20,687 --> 00:56:22,360
As I am in him.

954
00:56:23,231 --> 00:56:24,483
So...

955
00:56:26,193 --> 00:56:27,536
when you see him next,

956
00:56:28,654 --> 00:56:30,656
as I am sure you will,

957
00:56:31,531 --> 00:56:33,533
I will be watching you, too.

958
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:20,464
Are you...
Were you sleeping?

959
00:57:20,872 --> 00:57:23,591
Before. Earlier. No.

960
00:57:25,419 --> 00:57:26,636
Are you okay?

961
00:57:26,636 --> 00:57:28,255
Yeah, I am fine.

962
00:57:30,215 --> 00:57:31,341
You want to come in?

963
00:57:31,341 --> 00:57:32,597
Yeah.

964
00:57:40,434 --> 00:57:41,606
Power's still out.

965
00:57:43,729 --> 00:57:45,197
Room's still messy.

966
00:57:45,197 --> 00:57:46,615
I couldn't sleep.

967
00:57:47,482 --> 00:57:49,075
I was thinking.

968
00:57:50,569 --> 00:57:53,118
I wanted to tell you something
before tomorrow.

969
00:57:54,948 --> 00:57:56,950
Don't let Charles blow up your train.

970
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:00,837
I don't think it's right.

971
00:58:01,955 --> 00:58:03,483
I know he's your friend.

972
00:58:03,808 --> 00:58:04,924
He's so bossy.

973
00:58:04,925 --> 00:58:07,844
But I have known him
since kindergarten. He's really nice.

974
00:58:07,844 --> 00:58:10,589
He shouldn't always get what he wants.

975
00:58:10,964 --> 00:58:13,342
I mean, who always gets what they want?

976
00:58:16,803 --> 00:58:19,147
I know I don't know you at all.

977
00:58:19,639 --> 00:58:22,483
Even though it sort of feels like I do.

978
00:58:27,314 --> 00:58:30,659
Do you not feel like that?

979
00:58:30,984 --> 00:58:32,827
No. No, I totally do.

980
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:36,620
I am just kind of in shock
at this entire conversation.

981
00:58:40,827 --> 00:58:41,919
Power's back.

982
00:58:41,919 --> 00:58:43,668
No, no. Keep it.

983
00:59:27,624 --> 00:59:29,376
It's... It's so weird.

984
00:59:31,044 --> 00:59:32,720
Watching her like this.

985
00:59:33,145 --> 00:59:34,893
Like she's still here.

986
00:59:39,052 --> 00:59:40,881
She used to look at me...

987
00:59:41,706 --> 00:59:44,754
this way, like really look,

988
00:59:48,562 --> 00:59:50,954
and I just knew I was there,

989
00:59:51,079 --> 00:59:52,591
that I existed.

990
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:08,923
He drank that morning.

991
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:11,422
My dad.

992
01:00:14,921 --> 01:00:16,764
He missed his shift.

993
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,602
Your mom took it for him,

994
01:00:29,102 --> 01:00:30,695
the day of the accident.

995
01:00:52,042 --> 01:00:53,134
He...

996
01:00:55,128 --> 01:00:56,220
He...

997
01:00:56,713 --> 01:00:58,465
He. He wishes...

998
01:01:00,217 --> 01:01:03,061
I know he wishes it was him
instead of her.

999
01:01:08,225 --> 01:01:10,148
And sometimes I do, too.

1000
01:01:14,314 --> 01:01:16,282
Don't. Don't say that.

1001
01:01:18,568 --> 01:01:20,320
He's your dad.

1002
01:01:42,592 --> 01:01:44,344
Is... Is this normal?

1003
01:01:46,179 --> 01:01:48,102
No. This is new.

1004
01:02:39,524 --> 01:02:41,868
Want to tell me where you were?

1005
01:02:44,529 --> 01:02:46,327
Or should I tell you?

1006
01:02:54,706 --> 01:02:55,753
Sit down.

1007
01:02:56,875 --> 01:02:58,252
I should go to bed.

1008
01:02:58,752 --> 01:03:00,254
I want to talk to you.
I said sit down.

1009
01:03:00,254 --> 01:03:01,925
I don't want to sit down.

1010
01:03:03,757 --> 01:03:05,054
Then go.

1011
01:03:05,925 --> 01:03:08,428
Be just like your mother and leave.

1012
01:03:10,096 --> 01:03:11,268
Dad.

1013
01:03:11,765 --> 01:03:13,017
Go ahead. Go.

1014
01:03:15,101 --> 01:03:16,102
Go.

1015
01:03:22,776 --> 01:03:23,777
Alice.

1016
01:03:24,235 --> 01:03:25,307
Alice.

1017
01:03:25,779 --> 01:03:26,851
Alice.

1018
01:03:28,073 --> 01:03:29,120
Wait.

1019
01:03:52,972 --> 01:03:54,224
Ally, I am sorry.

1020
01:04:24,838 --> 01:04:25,910
Alice.

1021
01:04:28,299 --> 01:04:29,346
Ally.

1022
01:04:33,847 --> 01:04:35,019
Alice.

1023
01:04:35,348 --> 01:04:36,520
Ally.

1024
01:04:45,859 --> 01:04:46,951
Ally.

1025
01:04:50,864 --> 01:04:53,538
<i>Firelight at 0500 hours.</i>

1026
01:04:53,538 --> 01:04:56,377
<i>Operation Walking Distance
is in effect.</i>

1027
01:04:56,377 --> 01:04:59,293
<i>T-minus four hours to evacuation.</i>

1028
01:04:59,293 --> 01:05:02,046
<i>Evacuation in T-minus four hours.</i>

1029
01:05:02,709 --> 01:05:05,303
Why are you not reacting?
That thing went through my wall.

1030
01:05:05,303 --> 01:05:06,721
I told you not
to pick it up in the first place.

1031
01:05:06,721 --> 01:05:07,964
What are you so angry about?

1032
01:05:07,964 --> 01:05:09,299
That I am not
going to let you blow up my train?

1033
01:05:09,299 --> 01:05:11,651
That's part of it. Just a part.

1034
01:05:12,343 --> 01:05:16,393
Hey. Tell your sister that Donny from
Olsen's broke up with Karen.

1035
01:05:16,723 --> 01:05:19,192
That shit ended about a week ago.

1036
01:05:21,352 --> 01:05:22,478
What's your problem?

1037
01:05:22,478 --> 01:05:25,065
My whole movie's a disaster because of you.

1038
01:05:25,065 --> 01:05:26,570
I know my dad's being a turkey.

1039
01:05:26,570 --> 01:05:27,992
Whatever.

1040
01:05:28,735 --> 01:05:30,157
We're still going to finish your movie.

1041
01:05:30,157 --> 01:05:31,909
It's not about the movie.

1042
01:05:31,909 --> 01:05:33,577
What are you talking about?
Of course it is.

1043
01:05:33,577 --> 01:05:34,915
Just forget it.

1044
01:05:34,915 --> 01:05:38,583
Why? There's nothing wrong.
We're going to finish the movie.

1045
01:05:52,842 --> 01:05:55,345
I can get the camera back.
I know where my dad put it.

1046
01:05:55,345 --> 01:05:57,021
We can still make the festival.

1047
01:05:57,021 --> 01:05:59,019
It's not about the movie.
Then what is it about?

1048
01:05:59,019 --> 01:06:01,192
Jesus, you don't get it, do you?
It's obvious.

1049
01:06:01,192 --> 01:06:03,190
What's obvious?
God, you're a dumbass.

1050
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:05,271
That night of the crash,
you started getting all weird.

1051
01:06:05,271 --> 01:06:06,693
What? What are you talking about?

1052
01:06:06,693 --> 01:06:08,195
Like Mr. Attitude, all of a sudden.

1053
01:06:08,195 --> 01:06:11,027
Your movie was over.
That's what you said. You were upset.

1054
01:06:11,027 --> 01:06:13,033
Oh, my God.
I gave you a camera. I helped you.

1055
01:06:13,033 --> 01:06:14,534
Don't pretend like you did this for me.

1056
01:06:14,534 --> 01:06:16,116
You didn't do this for me,
and you know it.

1057
01:06:16,866 --> 01:06:19,920
This was never about me.
This was always about Alice.

1058
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:21,295
<i>Action.</i>

1059
01:06:21,295 --> 01:06:23,130
<i>I am going to stay here and investigate.</i>

1060
01:06:23,130 --> 01:06:26,380
<i>I think it's safer
if you leave town for a couple of days.</i>

1061
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:29,463
<i>John, I don't like it.
This case. These murders.</i>

1062
01:06:29,463 --> 01:06:30,721
<i>Well, what am I supposed to do</i>

1063
01:06:30,721 --> 01:06:32,640
Well, you're the one
who wanted the wife in the movie.

1064
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:33,967
Not so you
could fall in love with her.

1065
01:06:33,967 --> 01:06:36,220
What do you care
what I think about Alice anyway?

1066
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:37,695
Because I like her.

1067
01:06:37,895 --> 01:06:39,973
That's why I asked her to do
this thing in the first place,

1068
01:06:39,973 --> 01:06:42,505
so I could get to know her.
Not you.

1069
01:06:44,227 --> 01:06:45,319
You like Alice Dainard?

1070
01:06:45,319 --> 01:06:46,733
You're such an idiot.

1071
01:06:46,733 --> 01:06:48,656
<i>Watch out.
Joe, what the hell are you</i>

1072
01:06:48,656 --> 01:06:50,775
Oh, my God. Shit.
Run.

1073
01:06:52,902 --> 01:06:55,249
Shit. Look at all that smoke.

1074
01:06:55,374 --> 01:06:56,976
I can't use this.

1075
01:06:58,449 --> 01:07:00,219
You won't even
let me blow up your train.

1076
01:07:02,495 --> 01:07:04,068
Everything's bogus.

1077
01:07:08,126 --> 01:07:11,300
We could make another train
and blow that one up.

1078
01:07:16,509 --> 01:07:17,977
I do like her.

1079
01:07:18,344 --> 01:07:19,817
Sorry about that.
Shut up.

1080
01:07:21,806 --> 01:07:23,149
It's okay.

1081
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:26,023
That's not even what bothers me.

1082
01:07:28,813 --> 01:07:30,110
She likes you, too.

1083
01:07:31,816 --> 01:07:33,318
That's what really bothers me.

1084
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:37,264
I know it sounds stupid.
Why would she ever like me?

1085
01:07:38,656 --> 01:07:41,500
I haven't leaned out yet and the doctor
says it's going to happen.

1086
01:07:43,328 --> 01:07:46,502
I don't know.
Everything's just so bogus.

1087
01:07:46,873 --> 01:07:48,125
Charles.

1088
01:07:57,008 --> 01:07:58,726
Joe, what the hell?

1089
01:08:00,011 --> 01:08:01,513
What is that?

1090
01:08:02,055 --> 01:08:03,557
What is that?

1091
01:08:21,199 --> 01:08:22,746
Mr. Harkin. What's going on?

1092
01:08:22,746 --> 01:08:24,710
Evacuation. The fire.

1093
01:08:28,539 --> 01:08:29,711
Wait, wait.

1094
01:08:35,338 --> 01:08:37,591
<i>The county is being evacuated</i>

1095
01:08:37,591 --> 01:08:40,598
<i>due to a wildfire that
is raging out of control,</i>

1096
01:08:40,598 --> 01:08:44,018
<i>and threatening to reach
the Lillian chemical plant.</i>

1097
01:08:45,598 --> 01:08:48,351
<i>Please take with you essential items only.</i>

1098
01:08:48,351 --> 01:08:50,107
<i>If you are driving your own vehicle,</i>

1099
01:08:50,107 --> 01:08:53,198
<i>follow the Caravan
to the evacuation center:</i>

1100
01:08:53,564 --> 01:08:55,282
<i>Please remain calm.</i>

1101
01:09:26,305 --> 01:09:27,602
File in.

1102
01:09:28,099 --> 01:09:29,646
File in, please, file in.

1103
01:09:30,977 --> 01:09:31,978
Corporal.

1104
01:09:31,978 --> 01:09:33,150
I left the medication my wife needs.

1105
01:09:33,150 --> 01:09:36,491
Sir, the town is sealed off.
No one's allowed in.

1106
01:09:36,491 --> 01:09:38,655
H through N.
I can't get it anywhere else.

1107
01:09:38,985 --> 01:09:40,111
Charles.

1108
01:09:40,486 --> 01:09:41,658
Excuse me.

1109
01:09:41,988 --> 01:09:44,332
Charles, oh, thank God.

1110
01:09:44,657 --> 01:09:46,330
I went back to the house
and you were gone.

1111
01:09:46,330 --> 01:09:48,169
Yeah, they put us on the bus.

1112
01:09:48,169 --> 01:09:50,667
Hey, sweetie.
Hey. I am going to find my dad.

1113
01:09:50,667 --> 01:09:52,836
You going to tell him about that huge
Yes.

1114
01:09:52,836 --> 01:09:54,508
Come back if you can't find him.

1115
01:10:05,803 --> 01:10:07,521
Mr. Dainard, it's Joe Lamb.

1116
01:10:07,521 --> 01:10:09,606
I know you don't like me
and I am sorry about that,

1117
01:10:09,606 --> 01:10:10,774
but I am looking for my dad.

1118
01:10:11,976 --> 01:10:13,193
It took her.

1119
01:10:13,478 --> 01:10:16,152
It took Alice.
What?

1120
01:10:16,355 --> 01:10:18,198
I saw it. It was big.

1121
01:10:19,025 --> 01:10:21,619
And, I don't know, it was something.

1122
01:10:22,653 --> 01:10:24,872
I have never...
I have never...

1123
01:10:24,872 --> 01:10:28,038
No one believes me.
They just keep giving me pills and...

1124
01:10:28,826 --> 01:10:30,544
No one believes me.

1125
01:10:31,454 --> 01:10:32,671
I believe you.

1126
01:10:37,835 --> 01:10:38,882
That thing took her?

1127
01:10:38,882 --> 01:10:41,840
We have to go back to town to find
Alice, to find her. Come on, guys.

1128
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:43,971
Dude, she's dead. Alice is dead.
Don't say that.

1129
01:10:43,971 --> 01:10:46,052
First of all, I want to live. Okay?

1130
01:10:46,052 --> 01:10:47,887
Joe, what do you
actually expect to do, man?

1131
01:10:47,887 --> 01:10:50,098
The town's closed.
We're not allowed to go back.

1132
01:10:50,098 --> 01:10:52,104
Look, I have an idea.
I am going whether or not you come,

1133
01:10:52,104 --> 01:10:54,060
which I really hope you do.
Come on, guys.

1134
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:55,770
I have six tons
of explosives in this thing.

1135
01:10:55,770 --> 01:10:57,696
Let's find that thing and blow it to shit.

1136
01:10:57,696 --> 01:10:59,274
As if I am going to help you.

1137
01:10:59,274 --> 01:11:01,655
Do this for me,
I will babysit the twins next week,

1138
01:11:01,655 --> 01:11:03,452
so you can go to Wendy's stupid party.

1139
01:11:04,111 --> 01:11:05,237
I am not shitting you.

1140
01:11:05,237 --> 01:11:06,910
You can't ask me any questions, though,

1141
01:11:06,910 --> 01:11:09,242
and you can't tell anyone.
I am serious. Nobody.

1142
01:11:09,242 --> 01:11:11,248
Does it have to be him?

1143
01:11:11,248 --> 01:11:12,579
Yes or no, you ugly freak.

1144
01:11:12,579 --> 01:11:13,879
I am about to rescind the offer.

1145
01:11:16,374 --> 01:11:19,378
This whole evacuation
thing's really freaking me out.

1146
01:11:19,378 --> 01:11:21,383
Making me rethink my priorities.

1147
01:11:23,714 --> 01:11:25,887
Saw you over here
and thought maybe we could kick back.

1148
01:11:27,218 --> 01:11:28,561
We... We totally could.

1149
01:11:29,512 --> 01:11:32,391
I asked Charles about you
and he said you're a great guy.

1150
01:11:32,890 --> 01:11:34,258
I totally am.

1151
01:11:35,518 --> 01:11:38,613
Will you hate me if I start our
relationship by asking a favor?

1152
01:11:39,730 --> 01:11:41,653
So, there are
rules to being in my car, okay?

1153
01:11:41,653 --> 01:11:43,234
Where the hell are we going, anyway?

1154
01:11:43,234 --> 01:11:44,864
We're going to go to the school
and open the trailer

1155
01:11:44,864 --> 01:11:46,693
Woodward has in the parking lot.
I bet that.

1156
01:11:48,739 --> 01:11:50,412
I bet that's where he's keeping his research.

1157
01:11:50,412 --> 01:11:51,788
Research. What research?

1158
01:11:51,993 --> 01:11:53,540
We're going to learn everything we can
about that thing,

1159
01:11:53,540 --> 01:11:56,022
so that we can find it
and that's how we're going to save Alice.

1160
01:11:56,122 --> 01:11:57,331
Come on. Let's go.

1161
01:11:57,331 --> 01:12:01,045
Dorks, no shoes on my upholstery.
And no one touches my C.B.

1162
01:12:01,045 --> 01:12:02,344
You got it?
The dungeon? Are you serious?

1163
01:12:02,344 --> 01:12:04,343
Why else
are there six padlocks on the door?

1164
01:12:04,343 --> 01:12:06,090
We're going to the school.

1165
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:08,183
Since when did this one become so bossy?

1166
01:12:08,183 --> 01:12:09,351
I don't know.

1167
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:12,492
I got to take a leak.

1168
01:12:12,817 --> 01:12:15,299
What am I supposed to do, piss in here?

1169
01:12:22,607 --> 01:12:24,234
Thanks for the hospitality.

1170
01:12:28,905 --> 01:12:31,058
Am I going to go in alone,
or are you going to end up coming with...

1171
01:13:17,453 --> 01:13:18,670
<i>driving your own vehicle,</i>

1172
01:13:18,670 --> 01:13:21,670
<i>follow the Caravan
to the evacuation center:</i>

1173
01:13:31,217 --> 01:13:33,094
If the Air Force has already
searched Woodward's house,

1174
01:13:33,094 --> 01:13:35,305
wouldn't they have
searched stuff in the schoolroom, too?

1175
01:13:35,305 --> 01:13:36,613
Yeah, man, I was just
thinking about that, too.

1176
01:13:36,614 --> 01:13:38,350
Maybe his room, but not the dungeon.

1177
01:13:38,850 --> 01:13:40,852
Woodward keeps
all kinds of weird stuff in the dungeon.

1178
01:13:40,852 --> 01:13:42,094
Shut up!

1179
01:13:42,728 --> 01:13:44,776
So, what kind of music
does she like, your sister?

1180
01:13:45,564 --> 01:13:47,987
I don't care. Disco, I guess.

1181
01:13:49,026 --> 01:13:50,369
I can get back into disco.

1182
01:13:50,611 --> 01:13:52,955
We shouldn't take River Road,
they put a roadblock up.

1183
01:13:52,955 --> 01:13:55,874
Dork, I saw it. Observe.

1184
01:14:07,378 --> 01:14:09,346
So, what, I just wait here like a douche?

1185
01:14:09,346 --> 01:14:11,107
Yes. Thank you so
much for doing this.

1186
01:14:11,131 --> 01:14:12,916
Do you have a tire iron?

1187
01:14:23,269 --> 01:14:24,292
Joe, let me try.

1188
01:14:24,317 --> 01:14:25,466
Joe, let me try.

1189
01:14:26,105 --> 01:14:27,903
God, I hope my Electronic Football is in there.

1190
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:32,699
Joe, this is impossible, man.
There's no way we can do this.

1191
01:14:32,699 --> 01:14:34,997
These things are made like
a bank vault, like a safe.

1192
01:14:34,997 --> 01:14:37,306
Professional robbers can't even
get in through these things.

1193
01:14:37,331 --> 01:14:38,200
They're so...

1194
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:40,160
Shit.

1195
01:14:40,911 --> 01:14:42,254
I loosened it for you.

1196
01:14:45,666 --> 01:14:47,339
Guys.
Look at all this junk.

1197
01:14:47,339 --> 01:14:48,635
He's got movies in here.

1198
01:14:48,635 --> 01:14:51,134
I can't believe we're breaking
into the school.

1199
01:14:51,134 --> 01:14:54,433
Who does that?
Nobody does that. Idiots do that.

1200
01:14:57,662 --> 01:15:03,655
Dr. Woodward was dishonorably discharged
from Nellie Air Force Base in 1963

1201
01:15:03,980 --> 01:15:06,797
because of subversive conduct,
whatever that is.

1202
01:15:06,897 --> 01:15:09,323
Charles, check it out.
It's Old Man Woodward.

1203
01:15:11,067 --> 01:15:13,069
Back when he was like
Middle-Aged Man Woodward.

1204
01:15:14,445 --> 01:15:17,164
He's been tracking this thing since 1958.

1205
01:15:19,158 --> 01:15:20,626
What is this?

1206
01:15:21,410 --> 01:15:24,914
It says, April 8th, 1963 incident.

1207
01:15:25,414 --> 01:15:26,586
I don't know.

1208
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:32,592
Cary.
What?

1209
01:15:32,922 --> 01:15:34,515
We have to find this thing.
Come on.

1210
01:15:34,515 --> 01:15:35,933
Okay. Sorry.

1211
01:15:38,511 --> 01:15:40,263
<i>told them that this creature</i>

1212
01:15:40,263 --> 01:15:42,715
<i>is more sophisticated than any of us,</i>

1213
01:15:44,475 --> 01:15:48,446
<i>that his species is
predominantly subterranean.</i>

1214
01:15:48,854 --> 01:15:50,026
Subterranean.
<i>And that he is being treated</i>

1215
01:15:50,026 --> 01:15:52,696
<i>without compassion or respect.</i>

1216
01:15:54,276 --> 01:15:58,201
<i>I explained that all he wants
is to rebuild his ship,</i>

1217
01:15:58,201 --> 01:16:00,120
<i>a craft made up of those cubes,</i>

1218
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:02,702
<i>a complex shape-shifting alloy.</i>

1219
01:16:02,702 --> 01:16:06,832
<i>Remarkable material
that we will never fully understand.</i>

1220
01:16:08,207 --> 01:16:13,714
<i>He has been desperate to reconstitute
his ship since it crashed here in '58.</i>

1221
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:16,553
<i>But instead of giving him
the help he needs,</i>

1222
01:16:16,553 --> 01:16:18,847
<i>we have held him as a prisoner</i>

1223
01:16:19,135 --> 01:16:20,728
Guys, it's Dr. Woodward.
<i>He's been restrained</i>

1224
01:16:20,728 --> 01:16:24,478
<i>and experimented upon, biopsied,
and tortured by Nelec.</i>

1225
01:16:25,891 --> 01:16:27,564
<i>Through pain and lack of compassion,</i>

1226
01:16:27,564 --> 01:16:29,236
<i>we have taught him to hate us all.</i>

1227
01:16:30,187 --> 01:16:32,406
<i>We have turned him into an enemy.</i>

1228
01:16:32,406 --> 01:16:34,821
<i>I told them I knew these things</i>

1229
01:16:34,821 --> 01:16:36,652
<i>because he made contact with me,</i>

1230
01:16:36,652 --> 01:16:39,830
<i>that he makes a psychic
connection by touch.</i>

1231
01:16:40,072 --> 01:16:42,325
Oh, my God.

1232
01:16:42,325 --> 01:16:44,331
What is that thing?
What the hell?

1233
01:16:44,331 --> 01:16:46,253
I can't watch this.
Martin, you're going to throw up, man.

1234
01:16:46,253 --> 01:16:50,633
<i>The moment we made contact,
I understood him, and he me.</i>

1235
01:16:52,251 --> 01:16:56,381
<i>What I know is that if we don't change
this and begin helping him,</i>

1236
01:16:58,257 --> 01:17:00,259
<i>we will all pay the price.</i>

1237
01:17:01,886 --> 01:17:03,354
<i>But Nelec won't listen.</i>

1238
01:17:03,354 --> 01:17:05,355
He wasn't trying to kill it.

1239
01:17:05,355 --> 01:17:07,525
<i>He will have me discharged.</i>

1240
01:17:07,525 --> 01:17:08,935
<i>He was trying to help it escape.</i>

1241
01:17:08,935 --> 01:17:10,185
<i>But I won't give up.</i>

1242
01:17:11,103 --> 01:17:13,356
<i>I will do everything in my power</i>

1243
01:17:13,356 --> 01:17:14,611
<i>to set him free.</i>
Oh, my God.

1244
01:17:14,611 --> 01:17:18,240
You guys hear that?
<i>Help him rebuild that ship. I won't...</i>

1245
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:24,117
Freeze. Nobody move.

1246
01:17:25,743 --> 01:17:27,120
Do not move.

1247
01:17:38,964 --> 01:17:40,807
We got positive I.D. here.
It's just a bunch of kids.

1248
01:17:40,807 --> 01:17:41,975
Oh, shit.

1249
01:17:44,970 --> 01:17:46,392
Search them.

1250
01:17:47,056 --> 01:17:48,303
Let me see that.

1251
01:17:51,227 --> 01:17:53,070
I rolled those M-80s myself.

1252
01:17:53,479 --> 01:17:56,073
That's right.
Jesus, Cary, shut up.

1253
01:17:58,192 --> 01:17:59,569
You're the Deputy's boy.

1254
01:18:03,405 --> 01:18:04,577
No.

1255
01:18:06,158 --> 01:18:07,410
Move out.

1256
01:18:20,339 --> 01:18:23,764
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1257
01:18:27,179 --> 01:18:30,399
Breaker, breaker.
Requesting police backup.

1258
01:18:31,767 --> 01:18:33,735
Breaker 1-9. Is this the police channel?

1259
01:18:39,066 --> 01:18:41,785
Staff Sergeant.
Hi. How are you doing?

1260
01:18:44,238 --> 01:18:45,740
Hey, Mr. Lamb.

1261
01:18:46,282 --> 01:18:47,454
Rosko.

1262
01:18:48,075 --> 01:18:50,373
Hey. Where the hell have you been?

1263
01:18:50,373 --> 01:18:52,546
What are you wearing?
Come here.

1264
01:18:52,546 --> 01:18:54,234
The Air Force set that fire.

1265
01:18:54,235 --> 01:18:55,650
They want the town
empty for some reason.

1266
01:18:55,750 --> 01:18:57,255
This whole operation,
this whole military operation,

1267
01:18:57,255 --> 01:18:59,132
the evacuation, everything, it's all bad.

1268
01:18:59,132 --> 01:19:01,009
We need to find
Did you hear about Joe?

1269
01:19:02,464 --> 01:19:05,388
Look, dispatch
just got a call on citizens' band.

1270
01:19:05,388 --> 01:19:06,969
Joe and some of his friends,

1271
01:19:06,969 --> 01:19:10,207
they were grabbed by military
personnel at the middle school.

1272
01:19:13,434 --> 01:19:16,108
Preston, you tell me everything,

1273
01:19:16,108 --> 01:19:17,938
and I won't throw you in jail.

1274
01:19:18,564 --> 01:19:19,657
Yes, sir.

1275
01:19:20,282 --> 01:19:22,659
But I think you should look at this first.

1276
01:19:26,238 --> 01:19:29,333
Chief Master
Sergeant, Dustoff-03 is 20 minutes out.

1277
01:19:29,333 --> 01:19:31,331
<i>Roger that. Perimeter secure.</i>

1278
01:19:31,331 --> 01:19:33,583
<i>Standing by on lookout.
Prepare to engage.</i>

1279
01:19:33,583 --> 01:19:36,256
<i>Teams Kilo-Lima-Mike-November in position.</i>

1280
01:19:36,256 --> 01:19:39,336
<i>Teams Oscar-Foxtrot-Quebec-Romeo in position.</i>

1281
01:19:40,002 --> 01:19:42,346
<i>Cocked and locked. Ready to go.</i>

1282
01:19:46,342 --> 01:19:48,361
What's going to happen to us?

1283
01:19:49,762 --> 01:19:51,184
I think we're going to die.

1284
01:19:51,184 --> 01:19:54,358
Cary, shut up, man.
They wouldn't do that.

1285
01:19:54,358 --> 01:19:57,027
I am not kidding.
I think they're going to kill us.

1286
01:19:57,728 --> 01:20:00,948
They're not going to kill us.
You know why?

1287
01:20:00,948 --> 01:20:02,445
Why?
Because we're just...

1288
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:06,032
Hold on.

1289
01:20:07,821 --> 01:20:09,368
Hold on.

1290
01:20:18,165 --> 01:20:20,042
Was that that thing from the train?

1291
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:26,302
Why are we stopping?

1292
01:20:26,302 --> 01:20:27,759
Why are we stopped?
Holy shit.

1293
01:20:27,759 --> 01:20:29,889
Contact with precious cargo, three
clicks from city center.

1294
01:20:29,889 --> 01:20:31,185
Currently heading towards

1295
01:20:31,185 --> 01:20:33,263
Driver. Can you see anything up there?

1296
01:20:33,663 --> 01:20:34,940
No, sir. Nothing.

1297
01:20:36,058 --> 01:20:37,351
What's that gun?

1298
01:20:38,727 --> 01:20:41,025
Sako Bolt Action thirty-aught-six with...

1299
01:20:41,025 --> 01:20:42,231
Okay, we get it.

1300
01:20:42,231 --> 01:20:44,817
Those aren't bullets.
He's loading tracking darts.

1301
01:20:44,817 --> 01:20:46,994
Here. Tag it.

1302
01:20:52,741 --> 01:20:53,993
Yes, Sir.

1303
01:20:55,035 --> 01:20:56,287
Open the door.

1304
01:21:21,145 --> 01:21:22,964
I don't feel good about this.

1305
01:21:29,069 --> 01:21:31,743
Sir, is there a particular area
that you'd want me to shoot

1306
01:21:39,204 --> 01:21:41,332
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1307
01:21:41,332 --> 01:21:42,462
Help.

1308
01:21:47,296 --> 01:21:48,493
Oh, my God.

1309
01:21:48,593 --> 01:21:49,889
Get us out of here now.

1310
01:21:50,382 --> 01:21:51,634
What other firepower do we have?

1311
01:21:51,634 --> 01:21:53,139
There's a monster out there, Joe.

1312
01:21:53,139 --> 01:21:54,811
What the hell is it?

1313
01:22:01,852 --> 01:22:03,229
I got it, sir.

1314
01:22:17,201 --> 01:22:18,999
Guys, the seat belt is killing me.
Unhook it.

1315
01:22:18,999 --> 01:22:20,329
Come on.

1316
01:22:20,704 --> 01:22:21,956
Come on.

1317
01:22:34,718 --> 01:22:37,471
This is Nelec. Use the big guns.

1318
01:22:37,471 --> 01:22:40,433
Whatever happens to me, do not let it

1319
01:22:42,267 --> 01:22:44,065
Joe, open it.
Open the door.

1320
01:22:44,065 --> 01:22:47,068
It's bolted.
I want to go home so bad.

1321
01:22:47,068 --> 01:22:48,649
Open the door.

1322
01:22:48,649 --> 01:22:50,951
Please, sir.
Just let us out.

1323
01:22:52,027 --> 01:22:53,244
Please open it.

1324
01:22:53,244 --> 01:22:54,446
Where are the keys?

1325
01:22:54,905 --> 01:22:56,327
Overmyer had them.

1326
01:22:56,327 --> 01:22:58,659
Help me. My leg's stuck.

1327
01:22:58,659 --> 01:23:00,289
Please, sir, open the door.

1328
01:23:00,289 --> 01:23:01,791
Please, open the door.

1329
01:23:06,667 --> 01:23:07,919
Another one dead.

1330
01:23:10,128 --> 01:23:11,880
Guys, there's broken glass.

1331
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:13,136
Guys.

1332
01:23:13,136 --> 01:23:15,434
Martin. Martin.
Let me get on your shoulders. Come on.

1333
01:23:15,434 --> 01:23:16,601
Go, go, get up.

1334
01:23:16,601 --> 01:23:18,054
Here we go.
Go.

1335
01:23:18,054 --> 01:23:20,230
Come on, Joe. You can do it.
Come on, Joe.

1336
01:23:20,230 --> 01:23:22,478
You can do it, Joe. Let's go.
Come on.

1337
01:23:22,478 --> 01:23:23,980
Come on.
You can do it. Come on.

1338
01:23:31,233 --> 01:23:33,076
Joe, please. Go.

1339
01:23:33,443 --> 01:23:37,242
Come on. Break the glass, you pussy.
Come on, Joe. Hit it. Come on.

1340
01:23:48,250 --> 01:23:49,547
We got to go.

1341
01:23:56,216 --> 01:23:58,389
Go.
Come on, guys, hurry.

1342
01:24:33,462 --> 01:24:36,887
Come with us. We got some questions
for you. Come on.

1343
01:24:36,887 --> 01:24:38,308
Oh, no. Is she dead?
Just come with us.

1344
01:24:38,308 --> 01:24:40,852
Hey, fellows,
I have got orders from Colonel Nelec

1345
01:24:40,852 --> 01:24:42,429
to personally deliver this man back to base.

1346
01:24:42,429 --> 01:24:45,311
He's all yours, Staff Sergeant.
Let's go.

1347
01:24:45,311 --> 01:24:46,578
What are you doing?

1348
01:24:47,103 --> 01:24:48,313
Where are we going?

1349
01:24:48,727 --> 01:24:50,070
To find our kids.

1350
01:24:53,815 --> 01:24:56,785
Hey, guys. Guys, I found them.

1351
01:24:58,403 --> 01:25:01,202
Hey, guys. I found my firecrackers.

1352
01:25:01,202 --> 01:25:02,328
Congratulations.

1353
01:25:02,328 --> 01:25:04,330
Let's go, guys, they're coming back.

1354
01:25:04,330 --> 01:25:06,503
I think we should go. Come on.

1355
01:25:07,537 --> 01:25:08,834
Guys, come on.

1356
01:25:09,831 --> 01:25:11,333
No. No, look.

1357
01:25:15,343 --> 01:25:17,864
You dorks are alive?
I thought that...

1358
01:25:20,467 --> 01:25:21,844
What the fuck?

1359
01:25:21,844 --> 01:25:23,099
Donny. Donny.

1360
01:25:23,099 --> 01:25:24,725
We need a ride into town.

1361
01:25:24,725 --> 01:25:26,478
Okay, but just so you know,

1362
01:25:26,478 --> 01:25:28,524
I am massively stoned right now.

1363
01:25:29,142 --> 01:25:30,610
Do you want me to drive?

1364
01:25:34,815 --> 01:25:36,943
Guys, what was that?
It sounds like gunshots.

1365
01:25:36,943 --> 01:25:38,072
Joe, where are we going?

1366
01:25:38,072 --> 01:25:39,403
I saw something in the cemetery.

1367
01:25:39,403 --> 01:25:42,535
Woodward said it was subterranean.
I think I know where it is.

1368
01:25:42,535 --> 01:25:45,288
What the hell is that?
Move the damn car.

1369
01:25:52,624 --> 01:25:54,251
God.
Joe, turn the car around.

1370
01:25:54,251 --> 01:25:55,551
I can't. There's a tank behind us.
Holy shit.

1371
01:25:55,551 --> 01:25:57,129
What are they shooting at?
Guys, we have to run.

1372
01:25:57,129 --> 01:25:59,010
Donny. Hey, Donny, wake up.

1373
01:25:59,010 --> 01:26:01,933
He's too stoned.
Drugs are so bad.

1374
01:26:08,432 --> 01:26:10,810
Why is everyone firing?
We got to go.

1375
01:26:11,184 --> 01:26:13,186
Guys, come on, hurry.

1376
01:26:13,186 --> 01:26:16,023
This is crazy.
What is going on?

1377
01:26:16,940 --> 01:26:18,533
Look. It just exploded.

1378
01:26:18,817 --> 01:26:22,242
Sir. The weapons are misfiring.
All of them.

1379
01:26:22,242 --> 01:26:25,790
Surface-to-air. Radar.
It's a mess out here, sir.

1380
01:26:27,909 --> 01:26:29,957
Guys. Guys, run.

1381
01:26:30,203 --> 01:26:31,420
Come on.

1382
01:26:31,747 --> 01:26:33,420
What the hell is this?

1383
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:35,255
Go, Cary, go.

1384
01:26:37,711 --> 01:26:39,258
Jesus.
Go.

1385
01:26:43,508 --> 01:26:45,886
What the hell? Holy shit.

1386
01:26:55,771 --> 01:26:57,819
Why is everyone firing?

1387
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:02,368
Go, come on. Move ahead.

1388
01:27:05,530 --> 01:27:06,907
Oh, my God.

1389
01:27:14,831 --> 01:27:16,299
Come on, guys, move.

1390
01:27:16,299 --> 01:27:17,967
Did you guys see those explosions?

1391
01:27:17,967 --> 01:27:19,295
They were... They were huge.

1392
01:27:20,045 --> 01:27:21,422
Oh, my God.

1393
01:27:23,590 --> 01:27:24,807
Whose house is this?

1394
01:27:24,807 --> 01:27:27,261
It's Kathy's. I got it off the fridge.

1395
01:27:27,261 --> 01:27:29,472
Kathy? Yeah, I know her.

1396
01:27:30,305 --> 01:27:32,399
Charles, what are you thinking, dude?
That's not yours.

1397
01:27:32,399 --> 01:27:34,522
What, I am thirsty. I am in a war zone.

1398
01:27:34,522 --> 01:27:36,023
Clear. Clear.
Come on, move.

1399
01:27:36,023 --> 01:27:37,820
Let's go, move out.

1400
01:27:38,438 --> 01:27:40,190
Guys, come on, let's go.
Where are we going?

1401
01:27:40,190 --> 01:27:41,650
To the Cemetery I am...

1402
01:27:47,113 --> 01:27:49,832
Guys, what happened to my leg?
Man, it hurts.

1403
01:27:51,284 --> 01:27:54,584
Holy shit, Martin, you have got
a bone sticking out of your leg.

1404
01:27:55,956 --> 01:27:58,175
Joe, give me that thing off the curtains.

1405
01:27:58,175 --> 01:27:59,422
God.

1406
01:28:00,544 --> 01:28:01,841
I have got to go find Alice.

1407
01:28:01,841 --> 01:28:03,422
You guys stay here with Martin.

1408
01:28:03,964 --> 01:28:05,637
You going to be okay without me?

1409
01:28:06,424 --> 01:28:07,550
Yeah.

1410
01:28:08,260 --> 01:28:09,603
I am not staying with the girls.

1411
01:28:09,603 --> 01:28:11,687
God, Cary. Shut up.

1412
01:28:11,687 --> 01:28:13,765
Calm down.
Come on. Come on.

1413
01:28:13,765 --> 01:28:15,107
It hurts, Joe.

1414
01:28:15,107 --> 01:28:17,319
Okay, this is going
to hurt really bad, okay?

1415
01:28:18,562 --> 01:28:20,610
Jesus, Martin, I haven't done it yet.

1416
01:28:31,825 --> 01:28:32,997
Just Just follow me. Just follow me.

1417
01:28:32,997 --> 01:28:34,620
I have been following you
for the last five blocks.

1418
01:28:34,620 --> 01:28:36,037
What are we doing here?

1419
01:28:36,337 --> 01:28:38,627
Come on, through these doors.
Help me.

1420
01:28:38,627 --> 01:28:39,965
Help you with what?

1421
01:28:39,965 --> 01:28:41,476
We have to get inside.

1422
01:28:41,676 --> 01:28:43,591
Okay, okay. For what?

1423
01:28:44,504 --> 01:28:45,847
I will tell you in a second.

1424
01:28:45,847 --> 01:28:48,092
Why is there dirt in these windows?

1425
01:28:51,136 --> 01:28:53,355
It's here. Hard on three.
One, two, three.

1426
01:28:53,355 --> 01:28:55,269
One, two, three.

1427
01:28:55,269 --> 01:28:58,147
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

1428
01:29:08,653 --> 01:29:10,496
This This is scary.

1429
01:29:10,864 --> 01:29:12,332
You got any sparklers in there?

1430
01:29:13,533 --> 01:29:14,625
Are you kidding me?

1431
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:28,177
Alice is down there.

1432
01:29:43,813 --> 01:29:45,986
I came to your house that day

1433
01:29:46,858 --> 01:29:50,362
to tell you that I never meant
to hurt anyone.

1434
01:29:52,530 --> 01:29:54,077
I swear to God.

1435
01:29:57,243 --> 01:29:58,870
I am sorry, Jack.

1436
01:30:00,705 --> 01:30:03,174
About what happened to your wife.

1437
01:30:12,008 --> 01:30:13,726
It was an accident.

1438
01:30:21,017 --> 01:30:22,769
It was an accident.

1439
01:30:42,038 --> 01:30:44,257
Joe, I don't understand

1440
01:30:47,210 --> 01:30:48,553
This way.

1441
01:30:56,052 --> 01:30:57,269
<i>Why are you so surprised?</i>

1442
01:30:57,269 --> 01:30:59,810
<i>I always wear lipstick on my shirt.</i>

1443
01:31:44,976 --> 01:31:46,478
It's Sheriff Pruitt.
I know.

1444
01:31:46,853 --> 01:31:48,275
Cary, look.

1445
01:31:51,316 --> 01:31:52,943
There are bodies everywhere.

1446
01:31:52,943 --> 01:31:54,369
What is this?

1447
01:31:54,369 --> 01:31:56,284
We're under the water tower. Look.

1448
01:32:04,996 --> 01:32:07,470
She's got to be here.
She's got to be here.

1449
01:32:20,553 --> 01:32:22,555
It's eating a person.

1450
01:32:27,060 --> 01:32:28,152
She's here.

1451
01:32:28,478 --> 01:32:30,196
Oh, my God. I see her.

1452
01:32:30,647 --> 01:32:33,196
Okay. We're going to
use your firecrackers.

1453
01:32:34,150 --> 01:32:36,198
I don't think
that's going to hurt him, Joe.

1454
01:32:36,198 --> 01:32:38,868
There's other tunnels.
So?

1455
01:32:38,868 --> 01:32:41,662
I need you to make noise
right here in two minutes.

1456
01:32:41,662 --> 01:32:43,539
Make it loud and make it last.

1457
01:32:43,539 --> 01:32:45,003
Give me some sparklers.

1458
01:32:45,003 --> 01:32:47,297
Make sure you're gone when it blows.

1459
01:32:47,297 --> 01:32:49,420
You can't be here. You got to run.

1460
01:32:50,667 --> 01:32:52,419
Where are you going?

1461
01:33:26,953 --> 01:33:28,421
Come on, Cary.

1462
01:34:15,668 --> 01:34:17,762
Alice. Alice.
Please, we have to go. Come on.

1463
01:34:17,762 --> 01:34:19,805
Alice. Alice.

1464
01:34:21,174 --> 01:34:23,176
Please, come on.
We have to go. Alice.

1465
01:34:30,141 --> 01:34:31,984
You're alive.
You're alive.

1466
01:34:32,644 --> 01:34:33,703
You're alive.

1467
01:34:34,128 --> 01:34:35,272
Are you okay?
Can you hear me?

1468
01:34:35,272 --> 01:34:38,359
What is this?
What are you doing here?

1469
01:34:38,359 --> 01:34:40,156
I am just doing the best
I can to save you.

1470
01:34:50,203 --> 01:34:51,876
How did you know?

1471
01:34:52,330 --> 01:34:53,175
Your dad.

1472
01:34:53,700 --> 01:34:55,609
He told me. He was worried.

1473
01:34:55,709 --> 01:34:57,360
And flipping out.

1474
01:34:58,044 --> 01:34:59,512
Really?
We have to move.

1475
01:35:00,004 --> 01:35:01,347
Excuse me?

1476
01:35:03,675 --> 01:35:05,177
Where are we?

1477
01:35:06,135 --> 01:35:07,136
I left my bag in the car,

1478
01:35:07,136 --> 01:35:09,143
and then I went
out to the car to get my bag

1479
01:35:09,143 --> 01:35:10,690
It's been locked up for years.

1480
01:35:10,690 --> 01:35:13,651
It's terrified and hungry
 and it just wants to go home.

1481
01:35:13,651 --> 01:35:14,773
When it touched me, I knew.

1482
01:35:14,773 --> 01:35:17,526
I need you to help me
get the Sheriff down.

1483
01:35:28,866 --> 01:35:30,413
Follow me this way.
I will get us out of here.

1484
01:35:30,413 --> 01:35:32,537
Sheriff, we came that way.
Don't argue with me. Just follow me.

1485
01:35:32,537 --> 01:35:34,081
Come on, kids,
let's go with the Sheriff.

1486
01:35:45,925 --> 01:35:47,122
This way.

1487
01:35:49,220 --> 01:35:50,292
Joe.

1488
01:35:52,557 --> 01:35:53,809
I told you to get out.
What are you doing here?

1489
01:35:53,809 --> 01:35:56,690
I thought this was the way out.
Okay, I tried.

1490
01:35:56,690 --> 01:35:58,396
Hey, Alice, welcome back.
Hey.

1491
01:35:58,396 --> 01:36:00,239
Come on.
We got to get out of here

1492
01:36:02,692 --> 01:36:03,739
Guys, hurry.

1493
01:36:07,363 --> 01:36:08,580
Come on, go.

1494
01:36:12,785 --> 01:36:15,714
She's gone. It took her.
I don't want to be next.

1495
01:36:38,102 --> 01:36:40,930
Go. You don't want to be here. Go.

1496
01:36:40,930 --> 01:36:42,281
Joe, what are you doing?

1497
01:36:50,448 --> 01:36:52,100
Ally, what the hell is he doing?

1498
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:53,785
We understand.

1499
01:36:57,663 --> 01:36:58,915
But not everyone's horrible.

1500
01:37:00,333 --> 01:37:01,926
No.
Joe.

1501
01:37:03,628 --> 01:37:05,096
Let him down.

1502
01:37:15,139 --> 01:37:17,141
I know bad things happen.

1503
01:37:19,685 --> 01:37:21,312
Bad things happen.

1504
01:37:25,274 --> 01:37:27,051
But you can still live.

1505
01:37:31,656 --> 01:37:32,999
You can still live.

1506
01:38:15,575 --> 01:38:17,373
Okay, wait a minute.

1507
01:38:17,702 --> 01:38:18,874
What?

1508
01:39:06,417 --> 01:39:08,294
Look out.
Get down. Get down.

1509
01:39:46,123 --> 01:39:47,625
What is he doing?

1510
01:39:48,793 --> 01:39:50,591
He's making a model.

1511
01:40:35,506 --> 01:40:36,849
I got you.

1512
01:40:38,676 --> 01:40:40,019
I got you.

1513
01:44:24,693 --> 01:44:26,320
<i>This is where my friend was attacked.</i>

1514
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:28,576
<i>By who?
I have never seen him before.</i>

1515
01:44:28,864 --> 01:44:32,164
<i>He looked pale, crazy.
He bit my friend.</i>

1516
01:44:32,164 --> 01:44:33,586
<i>Then what happened?
He was dead.</i>

1517
01:44:33,586 --> 01:44:35,500
<i>And then...
He got up and walked away?</i>

1518
01:44:35,500 --> 01:44:37,377
<i>How did you know?
Anything left behind?</i>

1519
01:44:37,748 --> 01:44:40,422
<i>Yes, this fell out of
the pocket of the attacker's pocket.</i>

1520
01:44:40,422 --> 01:44:41,548
<i>Thank you.</i>

1521
01:44:44,505 --> 01:44:46,599
<i>Hello, Mr. President.
I am Detective Hathaway.</i>

1522
01:44:46,599 --> 01:44:50,595
<i>I am here to discuss some urgent matters
regarding your chemical factory.</i>

1523
01:44:50,595 --> 01:44:52,680
<i>Are you referring
to the recent incidents?</i>

1524
01:44:52,680 --> 01:44:53,764
<i>Yes, I believe I am.</i>

1525
01:44:53,764 --> 01:44:55,232
<i>Tell the chairman I will call him back.</i>

1526
01:44:55,599 --> 01:44:57,226
<i>You have three minutes.</i>

1527
01:44:57,852 --> 01:45:00,526
<i>You want to tell me
about those employees?</i>

1528
01:45:00,526 --> 01:45:04,029
<i>I was sorry to hear
of their unfortunate accident.</i>

1529
01:45:04,029 --> 01:45:07,362
<i>That was no accident.
Did you see the bites on their neck?</i>

1530
01:45:07,362 --> 01:45:08,946
<i>Are you suggesting some connection</i>

1531
01:45:08,946 --> 01:45:12,621
<i>between my chemical company
and those, those...</i>

1532
01:45:12,621 --> 01:45:14,373
<i>Those were zombie attacks.</i>

1533
01:45:14,577 --> 01:45:17,376
<i>Romero Chemical
has nothing to do with any such thing.</i>

1534
01:45:17,376 --> 01:45:19,081
<i>Then what happens in Building 47?</i>

1535
01:45:19,582 --> 01:45:22,461
<i>You wouldn't mind
if I took a look around, would you?</i>

1536
01:45:23,460 --> 01:45:24,962
<i>Of course not.</i>

1537
01:45:28,757 --> 01:45:30,384
<i>Good day to you, Mr. President.</i>

1538
01:45:30,384 --> 01:45:32,140
<i>Good day, Detective.</i>

1539
01:45:34,430 --> 01:45:35,647
<i>He knows.</i>

1540
01:46:08,005 --> 01:46:10,099
<i>Judith. It's me, your boss.</i>

1541
01:46:10,099 --> 01:46:12,017
<i>I need you to buy my wife
a ticket to Michigan.</i>

1542
01:46:12,017 --> 01:46:13,761
<i>It's too dangerous for her here.</i>

1543
01:46:13,761 --> 01:46:15,596
<i>I just love her so much.</i>

1544
01:46:17,765 --> 01:46:20,518
<i>John, I don't like it.
This case. These murders.</i>

1545
01:46:20,518 --> 01:46:22,936
<i>Well, what am I supposed to do,
go to Michigan with you?</i>

1546
01:46:22,936 --> 01:46:25,523
<i>Mackinac island's
beautiful this time of year.</i>

1547
01:46:25,523 --> 01:46:27,358
<i>Sweetheart, this is my job.</i>

1548
01:46:27,358 --> 01:46:29,367
<i>I just love you so much.</i>

1549
01:46:29,367 --> 01:46:30,702
<i>I love you, too.</i>

1550
01:46:40,371 --> 01:46:42,544
<i>I can't believe
we weren't killed last night.</i>

1551
01:46:42,544 --> 01:46:44,884
<i>Okay, now you have to leave town.</i>

1552
01:46:44,884 --> 01:46:46,802
<i>No. I am staying here with you.</i>

1553
01:46:46,802 --> 01:46:49,221
<i>I don't know what
I would do if something happened to you.</i>

1554
01:46:49,221 --> 01:46:50,806
<i>What if there are
survivors down there?</i>

1555
01:46:50,806 --> 01:46:53,555
<i>There were no survivors.
Did you see that crash?</i>

1556
01:46:53,555 --> 01:46:55,724
<i>Excuse me, sir,
were you in the wreck?</i>

1557
01:47:03,227 --> 01:47:05,980
<i>That settles it.
I am not going anywhere.</i>

1558
01:47:08,482 --> 01:47:10,576
<i>It's been two weeks,
and the murders continue.</i>

1559
01:47:10,576 --> 01:47:12,403
<i>This investigation is like no other.</i>

1560
01:47:12,403 --> 01:47:16,241
<i>It's putting too much
stress on this town and on my marriage.</i>

1561
01:47:18,367 --> 01:47:20,165
<i>Could zombies be real?</i>

1562
01:47:22,204 --> 01:47:24,172
<i>Hello? This is Detective Hathaway.</i>

1563
01:47:24,172 --> 01:47:26,046
<i>I will be right over.</i>

1564
01:47:26,667 --> 01:47:27,839
<i>What's happening here?</i>

1565
01:47:27,839 --> 01:47:29,261
<i>A military police investigation.</i>

1566
01:47:29,261 --> 01:47:30,588
<i>It was a suicide.</i>

1567
01:47:30,588 --> 01:47:32,340
<i>A suicide? Who was it?</i>

1568
01:47:32,340 --> 01:47:33,766
<i>A former Air Force officer.</i>

1569
01:47:33,766 --> 01:47:36,010
<i>Said there was
a secret he couldn't keep any longer.</i>

1570
01:47:36,010 --> 01:47:38,187
<i>It says he worked for Dr. Peter Braken?</i>

1571
01:47:38,187 --> 01:47:39,855
<i>I never would have given
you this information</i>

1572
01:47:39,855 --> 01:47:41,432
<i>if we hadn't served together in Vietnam.</i>

1573
01:47:41,932 --> 01:47:44,526
<i>Those were hard times.
I'd rather not talk about it.</i>

1574
01:47:47,438 --> 01:47:48,940
<i>Doctor.
Detective.</i>

1575
01:47:48,940 --> 01:47:51,192
<i>I am here to discuss your involvement
with Romero Chemical?</i>

1576
01:47:51,192 --> 01:47:53,698
<i>I was the one
that developed the special compound</i>

1577
01:47:53,698 --> 01:47:55,529
<i>to turn all these humans into zombies.</i>

1578
01:47:55,529 --> 01:47:57,865
<i>It was supposed
to be used as a military weapon,</i>

1579
01:47:57,865 --> 01:48:00,121
<i>but it got out of hand.
So I made this antidote</i>

1580
01:48:00,121 --> 01:48:02,794
<i>that will hopefully
cure all of the zombies.</i>

1581
01:48:02,794 --> 01:48:04,588
<i>That's incredible.
How much have you made?</i>

1582
01:48:05,039 --> 01:48:06,632
<i>Just this one.</i>

1583
01:48:06,632 --> 01:48:08,459
<i>Would you like to help me test it</i>

1584
01:48:08,459 --> 01:48:10,795
<i>on this innocent victim of my creation?</i>

1585
01:48:32,399 --> 01:48:33,742
<i>Honey, I am home.</i>

1586
01:48:33,742 --> 01:48:37,162
<i>Good news. We found a cure
for the zombie infection.</i>

1587
01:48:37,162 --> 01:48:38,409
<i>Honey?</i>

1588
01:48:59,802 --> 01:49:03,147
<i>Sorry. It didn't work.
I wish it worked.</i>

1589
01:49:03,430 --> 01:49:06,024
<i>I tried. I am sorry.
I am so sorry.</i>

1590
01:49:07,768 --> 01:49:08,940
<i>John?</i>

1591
01:49:23,700 --> 01:49:26,544
<i>This has been
a Charles Kaznyk production.</i>

1592
01:49:27,204 --> 01:49:30,549
<i>We had such a fun
time filming this movie, The Case.</i>

1593
01:49:31,041 --> 01:49:33,715
<i>So much fun that I hope you pick it</i>

1594
01:49:33,715 --> 01:49:36,806
<i>for the Cleveland
International Super 8 Film Festival.</i>

1595
01:49:37,806 --> 01:49:38,806
<i>God.</i>
