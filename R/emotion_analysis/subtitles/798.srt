1
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:34,742
l got a star on my car
and one on my chest

2
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:37,870
A gun on my hip and the right to arrest

3
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:40,998
l'm a guy who's the boss on this highway

4
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,209
So watch out what you're doin'
when you're drivin' my way

5
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:47,379
lf you break the law
you'll hear from me, l know

6
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:50,549
l'm workin' for the state
l'm the highway patrol

7
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:57,222
Well, you'll know me when you see me
'cause my door's painted white

8
00:00:57,307 --> 00:01:00,142
My siren a-screamin'
and my flashin' red light

9
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:03,562
l work all day and l work all night

10
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:06,648
Just to keep the law and order
tryin' to do what's right

11
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,568
lf l write you out a ticket
then you'd better drive slow

12
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:13,030
l'm just a-doin' my job
l'm the highway patrol

13
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:19,369
l'm the highway patrol
the highway patrol

14
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:22,539
My hours are long and my pay is low

15
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:25,584
But l'll do my best
to keep you drivin' slow

16
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:29,463
l'm just a-doin' my job
l'm the highway patrol

17
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:05,082
Meet Charlie.
Helpful dad, upstanding citizen,

18
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:10,212
and an 1 8-year veteran of the greatest
law enforcement agency in the land:

19
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,549
the Rhode lsland State Police.

20
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,474
That's Charlie's home.
Modest, like the man.

21
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,896
Even though he lived on the water,
Charlie wasn't much of a swimmer,

22
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:31,108
which will come into play
a little later in our story.

23
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:34,236
But l'm getting way ahead of myself.

24
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:39,199
You know, maybe it's best if we just
go back and begin at the beginning.

25
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:44,079
As a young man,
Charlie had the world by its bootstraps.

26
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,832
He was the best young trooper
on the force,

27
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:50,252
and was dating
the prettiest and smartest gal in town.

28
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,589
Her name was Layla. . .
Just like the melody.

29
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:56,091
Charlie,

30
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,635
you've no idea how much l love you.

31
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,391
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

32
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,604
Well, will you stay with me
no matter what?

33
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,814
Of course, Charlie.

34
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,694
What if l had to move to the Arctic
and you could never come home

35
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:20,490
and had to eat whale blubber for the rest
of your life? Would you still stay with me?

36
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,367
Yeah, l'd stay.

37
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,873
But l hope that never happens.

38
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:30,000
Yeah, me too.

39
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:38,175
Well, by springtime
they had made it official.

40
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:41,178
Boy, let me tell you,
that was some wedding.

41
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:44,056
lt was presided over
by Father Ken Gumbert,

42
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:48,185
and half of the Rhode lsland
State Police Force was in attendance.

43
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,483
-Congratulations, Charlie.
-Thank you, Captain.

44
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:14,670
All right!

45
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,841
Look what l got!

46
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,387
Here you go.

47
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,232
Excuse me, do you people take checks?

48
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:39,611
Say that again. Do "we people"
take checks? You mean a black man?

49
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,281
No, no, no, no! God, no. Your company.

50
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,450
Don't give me that bullshit!
That was a racist slur.

51
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:49,705
-No, it wasn't. l would never. . .
-Tell you what, l'll make it easy for you.

52
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:53,375
Why don't you just pay me in cotton
or a cartload of watermelons?

53
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:59,673
Or how's about some fried chicken, 'cause
you know black people love fried chicken !

54
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:01,800
-Hey, no, come on now.
-What's going on?

55
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:06,305
This cat don't believe a nigger knows how
to cash a check! Ain't that 'bout a bitch?

56
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:09,558
Charlie, l don't wanna ever hear you
use the n-word in this house.

57
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:13,979
What!
l never said anything remotely racist!

58
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:17,774
-Oh, so it's a "little people" thing, then.
-No!

59
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:22,571
You think just 'cause l'm small you can
push me around? Come on, let's boogie.

60
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:26,033
l'm gonna give you a little lesson
in low center of gravity.

61
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,455
Stop it! Cut it. . . Stop it now. Sir!

62
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:34,082
Don't patronize me with that "Sir" crap!

63
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,752
Hey, those are illegal. Stop.

64
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,384
Oh, it's on now. lt's on !

65
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,556
-Charlie, don't hit him !
-Me?

66
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,477
Charlie! Stop it! Charlie, stop it!

67
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,521
Let me handle this. Stop it!

68
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:01,943
Excuse me, Mr. Jackson. . .

69
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,697
Stop it! Wait. What is your first name?

70
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,657
lt's Shonté.

71
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:13,955
Shonté, l am so, so sorry. l apologize.

72
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,875
Come on here.
Let me walk you to your car.

73
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,754
l have no patience for people
who judge books by their cover.

74
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,631
And you shouldn't have to!

75
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:26,510
Treating me like a dumbshit!
l mean, who does he think he's talking to?

76
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:29,554
l'm a professor of molecular genetics
at Brown.

77
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,182
And l'm head
of the Boston chapter of Mensa.

78
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,060
-You're kidding?
-No.

79
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:38,730
l'm just driving this limo
as a sociological experiment. That's it.

80
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:42,943
But Mensa?
l'm president of the Providence chapter.

81
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,362
No kidding.

82
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:54,955
Just when Charlie thought
life couldn't get any sweeter,

83
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,917
old Mr. Stork dropped in
to pay him and Layla a visit.

84
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,838
lt's a boy!

85
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,842
Oh boy, oy, oy.

86
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,054
Wow!

87
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,224
He's so. . .

88
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,103
Wow!

89
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,567
Whoa, you're in luck!

90
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,069
He's got company!

91
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,364
Push ! Push !

92
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:35,120
Charlie loved those boys so much,
he just couldn't face the truth.

93
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:39,040
And so he went on with his life
as if everything was normal.

94
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,837
Hey, Finneran.

95
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,213
Hey, buddy.

96
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:49,301
-Hope you brought your appetite with you.
-Oh, l did.

97
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:53,555
-Charlie, your kids look great.
-Yeah, don't they? Thanks.

98
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,393
Charlie,

99
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,021
just between you and me,

100
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:04,733
d'you ever notice
that your kids have a year-round tan?

101
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,943
Yeah, well. . .

102
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:11,156
-My great-grandmother's half-ltalian.
-Half-ltalian?

103
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:16,745
Well, that's probably why
the water beads off the hair, huh?

104
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:23,710
Yeah, so? l mean, a lot of people
have different kind of hair.

105
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:26,796
What are you getting at?

106
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,174
Well, no, l'm just saying it's. . .

107
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:34,596
Come on, goddamn it! Those kids' dicks
are bigger than them sausages!

108
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,432
Knock it off!
You're talking about my children.

109
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,685
-Since you brought it up, l wanna ask. . .
-Finneran !

110
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,104
Get over here. lt's your turn.

111
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,653
Charlie. . .

112
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,115
Don't mind me.
lt's just the beer talking, you know?

113
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,160
Sure.

114
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:08,463
There's something powerful
bubbling up inside me, Father.

115
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,509
And l'm afraid that some day,

116
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,973
if l don't do something, l'm gonna explode.

117
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,937
Where does this rage come from, my son?

118
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,940
l don't know. lt's a lot of things, really.

119
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,110
Take my wife, for example.

120
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,487
l love her like no other, but. . .

121
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:36,199
Part of me suspects
that she may be having an affeir.

122
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:40,787
And l'm probably
just being paranoid here, but. . .

123
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:46,835
l get the feeling that the entire town
is laughing at me behind my back.

124
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,672
Charlie, that you?

125
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,969
Eventually,
Charlie's worst fears were realized.

126
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,846
l'm so sorry, Charlie.

127
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:01,349
Really, l am.

128
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:03,810
But l have to do this.

129
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,354
l found my soul mate.

130
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,732
But. . .

131
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,359
l thought l was your soul mate.

132
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,823
Come on, legs! Let's roll, baby.

133
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,702
l don't know what to say.

134
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,497
l guess the heart just wants
what the heart wants.

135
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,710
Bye, Charlie.

136
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,923
But you said you'd eat whale blubber.

137
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,303
She'll be eating blubber all right,
just as soon as l free willy.

138
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:57,530
lt's funny how a man reacts
when his heart gets broken.

139
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,450
Some break down and cry like a baby.

140
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:03,828
Others, they take out an Uzi
and climb a clock tower.

141
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:07,082
But Charlie Baileygates
didn't seem to react at all.

142
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:13,046
He just swallowed hard, felt that slab of
heartache slide over the lump in his throat

143
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,590
and he locked it all away.

144
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:21,638
As you can imagine,

145
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:26,184
it wasn't easy for little Jamaal,
Lee Harvey and Shonté Junior

146
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,144
growing up without a mom.

147
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:32,023
But Charlie made that little house
into a big old home,

148
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,983
and the boys flourished.

149
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:37,112
Let me tell you, they were smart ones.

150
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,782
-What are you building, fellas?
-An airplane, Daddy.

151
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,080
Bye-bye!

152
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:50,500
Bye, Daddy! Have a good time at work.

153
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,922
Love you, Daddy!

154
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,889
No! Hey, stop it!

155
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:07,350
Get. . . Jamaal, you're in a lot of trouble!

156
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,228
Get off that! Don't you take off in that!

157
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:15,066
How many seas must a white. . .

158
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:19,404
Shonté Junior, how can you keep
eating that crap and never gain weight?

159
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,865
l don't know. Just lucky, l guess.

160
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,413
-How many times must the cannonballs. . .
-Do you believe his voice?

161
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:33,585
-That's Gomer Pyle!
-Before they're forever banned?

162
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:36,671
Daddy, can we watch Richard Pryor
on HBO?

163
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,674
Richard Pryor?

164
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,843
Please.

165
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,553
Okay.

166
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:48,266
ln Africa, though, l go out in the country.

167
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:52,896
You see some lions and shit.
l'm talkin' about real lions.

168
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,065
Not them kind
you be fuckin' with in the zoo.

169
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,360
You know how you go fuck with a lion?
"Hey, lion ! Motherfucker!"

170
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:04,449
Be throwin' shit at it. Lion'd be "Oh, ooh."

171
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:09,412
As they have a way of doing,
the years passed somewhat regularly.

172
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:12,999
And the boys, well,
they came into their own.

173
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,086
. . .toss my salad !

174
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,882
The guy's like "Toss my salad?
What's that?"

175
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:27,680
Having your salad tossed means having
your asshole eaten out with jelly or syrup.

176
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,808
l prefer syrup.

177
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,228
He's a funny motherfucker!

178
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:43,238
Although Charlie's police work had started
to suffer, the kids were doing great.

179
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:47,242
Damn ! l can't figure out the atomic mass
of this motherfuckin' deuteron.

180
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,120
Shit. Man, that shit's simple. Lookit.

181
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,498
-Tell me this, tell me this.
-What?

182
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,376
What's a deuteron made up of?

183
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,753
Duh ! A proton and a neutron.

184
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:02,507
Then what's this motherfuckin' electron
doin' right there?

185
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,761
-Shit, l don't know.
-Well, get it out of there then !

186
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,013
OK, so you're sayin'
l add up the atomic masses

187
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,099
of the proton and the neutron, right?

188
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,894
l sees that, but what do l do with
the goddamn electron? Can l put it here?

189
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:18,940
Enrico Fermi'd roll over in his
motherfuckin' grave if he heard that.

190
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,526
He'd just turn over ass up in yo' face.

191
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,653
Man, Jamaal.
Just cut my man some slack.

192
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:26,030
l'm just trying to help him save face.

193
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:29,200
He keep askin' questions,
they'll think he's stupid.

194
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,035
-l ain't stupid.
-Mornin' , fellas.

195
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,913
Hey, Pops, how you doin' , man?

196
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:37,417
-What's all the commotion?
-Oh, just school shit and shit.

197
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,878
-How's my little guy doing?
-Struggling.

198
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:44,007
Quantum physics is confusing. lf l don't
buckle down, l'll get myself another B+ .

199
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,800
Oh, that'd be whack.

200
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:49,137
He's so fucking dumb,
he thinks calculus is a goddamn emperor.

201
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,139
Give it up, dawg.

202
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:54,309
Well, you think polypeptide's
a motherfuckin' toothpaste.

203
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:57,520
Oh, l gotta get out of here.
l don't wanna have to bust a cap.

204
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:00,857
Kisses.

205
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,319
Daddy.

206
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,446
-See ya later.
-Love ya.

207
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:11,534
Yeah, Charlie was getting
a lot of respect inside the house.

208
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:15,705
But outside. . .
Well, that was another story.

209
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,670
Mornin' , Ed.

210
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,006
Charlie.

211
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,176
Ed, did you see
where my paper went today?

212
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,637
The wife's got it in the shitter.

213
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:36,684
Well, could you tell her to throw it
on the porch when she's done?

214
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,021
Can't you get one at work?

215
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,234
Yeah. . .

216
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,279
l suppose l could.

217
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:50,031
You betcha.

218
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,669
l'd like that

219
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:07,423
lf we could cycle down some lane

220
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:11,135
l'd like that

221
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,264
lf we could ride into the rain

222
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,266
No macs, getting wet

223
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,978
l'd be your Albert

224
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:23,481
lf you'd be Victoria

225
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:29,237
Ha-ha, we'd laugh
because each drop would make me

226
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:33,074
Grow up really high, really high

227
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:37,161
Like a really high thing, say a sunflower. . .

228
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,956
-Hey, George, Herb.
-Hi, Charlie.

229
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,500
-How do, fellas?
-Hi, Charlie.

230
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:46,337
-Listen, Dick. . .
-Hey, guys, check out the rack on this one!

231
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,301
Oh, yeah ! That's what Daddy likes.

232
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,345
lt looks like a dead heat in a zeppelin race.

233
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:58,099
-A couple of Hindenburgs, huh?
-Oh, the humanity!

234
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,019
Come on, guys, take it easy. She's a mom.

235
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,487
"She's a mom !"

236
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:16,034
-She's a mom. Not my mom.
-She's a yummy mummy!

237
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,456
You kill me!

238
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,964
Sure, that is good.

239
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:37,597
Listen, Dick,
l'm sorry to bother you like this but. . .

240
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,809
Your car is gonna have to be moved.

241
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:46,773
Yeah, sure, Charlie. OK. l should be
done here in another 1 0 or 1 5 minutes.

242
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:51,486
l hate to be a stickler, Dick, but. . .

243
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:54,280
The law says you can't park in one place
for over an hour,

244
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,532
and you've been there for. . .

245
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,994
Going on three days now.

246
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,956
All right, all right. The law's the law.

247
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:08,753
Park it up behind the grocery store,
will ya, Charlie?

248
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,675
Yeah, sure.

249
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,262
This one?

250
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:23,810
There's an old saying: an ostrich with
his head in the sand makes a lousy cop.

251
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:27,063
You see, if you can't deal
with your own problems,

252
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,107
well, it's hard to deal with others.

253
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:32,777
Sweetie? That's kinda dangerous.

254
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:35,530
Wanna move it on to the sidewalk,
away from traffic?

255
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:39,534
My dad says you're a joke
and l don't have to listen to you.

256
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:47,333
Well, your father is entitled to his opinion.

257
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:50,628
But l am an officer of the law,
and, by all rights, l could. . .

258
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,255
Fuck off!

259
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,508
You should watch your mouth, little girl.

260
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,813
Excuse me. Charlie!

261
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:12,108
Hey! You mind if l get ahead of you?
l'm in a wicked rush.

262
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:14,777
-Oh, yeah, sure. Go ahead.
-You're a doll.

263
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,572
Hey, kids! Over here! Now!

264
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:22,743
Didn't l tell you to stay with me?

265
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,842
We're gonna rock you

266
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,372
VagiClean, huh?

267
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,834
What's the matter, honey?
Little extra cheese on the taco?

268
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,380
-Excuse me?
-No, excuse me.

269
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,635
There's no tag on this.

270
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,180
Price check on VagiClean, aisle five.

271
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:27,892
l repeat: price check on VagiClean,
aisle five.

272
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,685
That's VagiClean.

273
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,188
We got a customer with a fallopian fungus.

274
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,524
She's baking bread
and l think it's sourdough.

275
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,613
Put a rush on that.

276
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:45,076
Hey, big guy. Did you hear the news?

277
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,828
My son Billy
got the lead in the high-school musical.

278
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,624
Well, l guess he likes the cock after all.

279
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:06,305
-Still wanna skip rope in the street?
-l'll tell my daddy, Charlie!

280
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,517
Wrong answer.
And the name's Hank, fuckface.

281
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,353
Reciting memorized lines

282
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:16,941
And l'm not fit to touch

283
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,403
The hem of your garment

284
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:24,907
No, no, l'm not fit to touch

285
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:29,161
The hem of your garment

286
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,880
l have no love but only goals

287
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:44,343
How very empty is my soul

288
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,597
lt is a soul that could easily kill

289
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:57,523
And l'm not fit to touch. . .

290
00:21:57,607 --> 00:22:00,693
There you go, Dick. l parked it for you.

291
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,903
By the way,

292
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,409
you got a headlight out.

293
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,287
That looks good.

294
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:56,791
-There you go, Colonel.
-Very good, Malcolm. Thank you.

295
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,710
Colonel, something's wrong with Charlie.

296
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,713
-1 -X to 1 -1 2.
-1 -1 2 responding.

297
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:07,718
Of course, there's not much
about this sort of thing

298
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,221
in the Rhode lsland State Police manual.

299
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:15,017
So they sent him up to Boston to see
a team of highly trained head doctors.

300
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:17,645
They quickly identified the problem.

301
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,648
You got a major screw loose.

302
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:25,778
Doctors have diagnosed you
as having a "split personality."

303
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:27,321
A schizo.

304
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:32,410
-l don't remember this.
-That's because, according to that report,

305
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:35,913
it wasn't you that this was happening to.
lt was this other guy.

306
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,123
Hank.

307
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:41,168
-Said his name was Hank.
-And apparently Hank is trying to get out.

308
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,088
Trying to get out?
What do you mean "get out"?

309
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,257
-How did he get in?
-You created him.

310
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:49,343
By not dealing
with your problems, Charlie.

311
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,431
Ever since. . .

312
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:57,643
Well, you know.
You've been avoiding confrontation.

313
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:00,563
-But this guy inside.
-Hank.

314
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:05,985
He doesn't. Doctors feel that you've
created this character out of necessity.

315
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:07,945
You never stick up for yourself.

316
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:12,825
Charlie, why didn't you take a vacation
when Layla left?

317
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:19,790
Why would l?

318
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:23,836
You know, wives leave their husbands
every day in this country.

319
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:27,256
That's no reason
to short-change the department.

320
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,009
l mean, it's not like l had the flu. . .

321
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:41,270
Have you picked up your medication?

322
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:51,447
l'm really not crazy about it, though.
lt makes me so dry.

323
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:53,199
You have to take it anyway.

324
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:56,327
Dr. Rabinowitz assures us,
if you do, everything'll be fine.

325
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,579
This is a bunch of crap!

326
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:02,583
No wonder you're the smallest state.
Little mind, little state.

327
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:05,211
Shouldn't even be a state.
Should be a district.

328
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,255
Can you take these goddamn things off?

329
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,091
And could you stop lookin' at my ass!

330
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:15,012
Pritchard, what's going on here?

331
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,515
Well, Colonel, her name's Waters, lrene P .

332
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,434
l pulled her over on 95
for a broken tail light.

333
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:24,688
l ran a check. She's got
an outstanding warrant in New York.

334
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,815
-Hit and run?
-Hit and run.

335
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,026
lnjured pedestrian signed the complaint.

336
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,863
Well, l think l might remember that.
That is ridiculous.

337
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,533
l've never been in an accident.
Not in my whole life.

338
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:39,495
Well, l've just gotten off the phone
with the New York State Patrol.

339
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:42,456
They don't seem to think it's so ridiculous.

340
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:48,754
-Look. . . How can we fix. . .
-Were you in Massena last Friday?

341
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:52,508
Well, yeah, l live there.
But l didn't have any accident.

342
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:56,470
l'm just driving down to Block lsland
to see my sister.

343
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,807
You seem like a nice guy.
ls there any way that you might let me

344
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,725
handle this by mail or. . .

345
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:05,020
Unfortunately, Miss Waters,
l'm not the one you have to convince.

346
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:09,149
lf there's been a mistake,
you have to clear it up in Massena.

347
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:13,279
What?
Because of somebody else's mistake,

348
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:17,533
l have to get in my car and drive
all the way back to upstate New York?

349
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:27,960
No, ma'am.

350
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:33,007
We'll have one of our troopers escort you.

351
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,598
Hey, Hollywood,
turn your fuckin' phone off.

352
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,516
-Yeah?
-You're an asshole.

353
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,768
Oh, hello, lrene. What'd l do now?

354
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:47,605
Listen, l'm at a police station
in Rhode lsland.

355
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:50,524
They're shipping me back to Massena
on some bogus crap.

356
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,277
-Sound familiar?
-l don't have a clue

357
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,029
-what you're talkin' about.
-Dickie!

358
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,697
Cut the bullshit!

359
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,995
Listen to me, OK?

360
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,581
lt's over, Dickie. lt's over.

361
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:08,459
So please just stop messing with me

362
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:11,629
and call your friends
and tell them to back off, OK?

363
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,297
Look, l'm being a straight shooter.

364
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:15,591
lf you need help, l'll help you.

365
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:20,054
Just give me all the details
and l'll get to the bottom of it.

366
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:24,350
Massena, New York!
Goddamn, Daddy! That's near Canada!

367
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,769
l know, l know. Wasn't my idea.

368
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,854
l gotta take this gal up north,

369
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:31,899
and then the colonel ordered me
to take a week's vacation.

370
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:34,151
A week's a long motherfuckin' time.

371
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:37,696
He wants me to rest
while l'm getting used to the medication.

372
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,741
Oh, come on. You don't have to worry
about us, Daddy. We're grown up now.

373
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:44,995
These two can do the shopping.
l'll do the cooking.

374
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,999
You do the cooking? Man, you thought you
got chipped beef from a toothy blow job!

375
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:52,127
You're gonna have Shonté Junior
down or under goddamn 400lb. Fuck that.

376
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,924
Can't have that happen. OK, guys.

377
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:02,096
l'm not leaving till the morning, but you
know the rules: no bitches after eleven.

378
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,600
-All right, Pops.
-Yeah, man.

379
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,477
-Got you, Papa.
-Love you, Daddy!

380
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:14,525
So who the hell's
this lrene honey anyway?

381
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,152
She worked for me the past two years.

382
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:21,323
l hired her to be my golf-course
superintendent. We got close.

383
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,158
No, you got stupid !

384
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:28,580
For the love of shit, these are
the loose ends that can hang you, Dickie!

385
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:29,915
And me too!

386
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:32,292
How much does she know?

387
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,878
She might have gotten wind
of some things.

388
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,339
Yeah, well, we're gonna find out.

389
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:40,300
The complaint was signed
by a guy named Peterson.

390
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:45,097
-He's with the EPA.
-EPA? l thought they were in our pocket.

391
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,516
Well, not all of 'em.

392
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:52,646
Even though Charlie didn't
wholeheartedly agree with the top brass,

393
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,648
he did as he was told.

394
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,693
-Careful on the road, Charlie.
-OK, Colonel.

395
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,742
-Hang on, ma'am.
-Yeah.

396
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:16,462
This vacation is just what Charlie needs.

397
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,465
l bet he's a new man when he gets back.

398
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:22,134
lf we let him back.

399
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,763
What do you mean?

400
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:29,641
Well, l mean that
he's become a pretty big liability.

401
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:32,436
We may have to let him go.

402
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:36,940
Let him go? But, Captain,
police work is Charlie's whole li. . .

403
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,026
l know, l know, damn it.

404
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,278
l know.

405
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:46,366
l found you sittin' on a suitcase cryin' . . .

406
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:52,080
lt's a great time of year to ride, as long as
you don't mind one or two bugs.

407
00:29:56,377 --> 00:30:03,091
l laugh out loud 'cause it's the one thing
l hadn't been tryin'

408
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,220
The train came in breathless

409
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:08,013
The passengers restless

410
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:11,600
He said "Baby, you'll never change"

411
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:15,729
You gotta get goin' , you gotta keep goin'

412
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:19,358
Hey, the world ain't slowin' down

413
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:20,859
For no one

414
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:25,572
lt's a carnival callin' out to you

415
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:31,495
lt sounds like a song
lt hits you like Scripture. . .

416
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:34,164
Boy, you can't beat the open road !

417
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:41,839
Weren't you the kid
who just climbed on the merry-go-round?

418
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:46,510
Hey, look, the world ain't slowin' down

419
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,848
Oh, no.

420
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,808
Oh, my goodness.

421
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,185
Jeez.

422
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:58,272
Those damn truckers.

423
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:02,693
You know, you think they'd call someone
to come clean this up.

424
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:07,155
Poor thing. That's terrible.

425
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,952
By the looks of her,
she's been here for a while.

426
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:16,373
Well, l doubt we're gonna be able
to move her, but we should try.

427
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:18,584
You wanna get that end? Give it a push?

428
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:21,128
-Really?
-Yeah, we should give it a shot.

429
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,505
-OK?
-OK.

430
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,633
Go ahead. Just push as hard as you can.

431
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,218
Yeah, OK.

432
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:31,221
Jesus! Holy. . .

433
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:34,558
-OK. . .
-lt's still alive!

434
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:38,395
-Just stand back. l'll take care of it.
-Oh, God ! That's terrible.

435
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:42,316
Now, don't look, OK?

436
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,990
Well, old girl.

437
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,660
Your suffering's over.

438
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:05,380
Oh, it ain't always easy
doing Mother Nature's work.

439
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,270
-Do you believe that?
-No, it's. . .

440
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,149
My God in heaven !

441
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,530
What is wrong with you?

442
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:31,782
Die!

443
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:35,786
Let go! Let go, girl !

444
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:40,874
On to greener pastures, come on. They're
clear-cutting a place in heaven for ya.

445
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:43,043
Come on ! Help me out!

446
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,544
-But. . .
-Do something !

447
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:47,714
-l don't. . .
-Let go!

448
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,386
Let go! Go!

449
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:04,272
Well,

450
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,733
that was tough, but. . .

451
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,153
l think we did the right thing.

452
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:25,252
Patrol car, yes. OK, thank you.

453
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:30,007
-Can l help you?
-Baileygates, Rhode lsland State Police.

454
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:33,301
l have your prisoner,
Miss lrene Waters, here.

455
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:38,015
-All right. l'll tell them you're here.
-Okay-dee, ray-dee.

456
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,903
What are those for?

457
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:55,115
Oh, it's just this stupid thing.

458
00:33:55,324 --> 00:34:00,370
l have to take a pill every six hours
or l feel funny. No big deal.

459
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,790
What's it called?

460
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:08,170
Advanced delusionary schizophrenia
with involuntary narcissistic rage.

461
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:16,344
Does your ass feel numb?

462
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,473
No, but. . .

463
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:23,185
They give me unbelievable cottonmouth.

464
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:26,730
-l meant from the ride.
-Oh. No, no.

465
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:29,399
Over the years
my ass has taken a pounding.

466
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:35,947
My name's Peterson.
This is my partner, Agent Boshane.

467
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:39,576
We're with the Environmental Protection
Agency's Special lnvestigations.

468
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,827
The EPA?

469
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,914
What'd l hit? A baldheaded eagle?

470
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:48,668
We'll explain that to you, ma'am, but right
now we're gonna ask you to come with us.

471
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:54,174
Well, why don't you just
explain it to me now?

472
00:34:55,676 --> 00:35:00,931
We put your hit-and-run report out
on the wire in order to track you down.

473
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,225
Track me down for what?

474
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,852
Agent Boshane?

475
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:11,608
l want to remind you again,
our station's at your disposal.

476
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:14,444
You're welcome to use
our interrogation rooms.

477
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:17,948
We appreciate it, Lieutenant Gerke,
but we're all set.

478
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,202
Right. Well, if there's anything at all l. . .

479
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,134
Excuse me.

480
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,510
l'm just gonna. . .

481
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:42,180
Get myself a drink of water.

482
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:55,819
So, if l could just get someone
to sign this, l'll be on my way.

483
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:57,070
Yeah.

484
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:03,910
Well, Miss Waters, good luck.
l hope everything works out great for you.

485
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,287
Thanks a lot, Charlie.

486
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,250
l haven't done anything wrong
and you know it.

487
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:16,506
What about the marijuana roaches you left
when you moved out of your apartment?

488
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,759
So l smoked some pot.
What is that, a crime?

489
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:25,432
As is being an accessory
to bribery, embezzlement,

490
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,519
-tax evasion and racketeering.
-What are you talking about?

491
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:32,439
Does the name Dickie Thurman ring a bell?

492
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:38,111
His company, Cedar Creek Limited, has
been under investigation for 1 8 months.

493
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:42,532
How does that make me an accessory?
l laid sod on Dickie's golf course. So what?

494
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:46,620
Tell me this. A big operation
like the Cedar Creek Country Club.

495
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,789
How'd you become
the head greenskeeper?

496
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,249
By default.

497
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:56,880
This guy, Tedeschi or Tedesco,
he was hired before me, but he died.

498
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:58,506
Heart problem or something.

499
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:04,512
The feds believed that lrene
knew more than she thought she knew,

500
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:06,348
and her life was in danger.

501
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:10,727
They explained that everything
had been happening under her nose.

502
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:14,731
Payoffs of government agencies,
threats to those who stood in the way.

503
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:20,695
And her predecessor's heart attack?
Well, that was just cold-blooded murder.

504
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,281
Oh, man !

505
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:33,500
Can you excuse me?

506
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,020
Pizza kid.

507
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:00,527
-How much?
-That comes to $1 3.95.

508
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,512
Son of a bitch !

509
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:47,198
lt was a good thing Charlie had told her

510
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:51,536
he was staying at the Chuck E. Cheese
Lodge and Miniature Golf Resort.

511
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,663
Charlie?

512
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:57,959
lrene finagled the key from the front desk
and let herself in.

513
00:38:58,294 --> 00:38:59,586
Charlie!

514
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,932
Charlie, what's going on here?

515
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,517
lrene?

516
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:21,649
lrene, l was just. . .
l was gonna study your file

517
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:24,194
and try to find a loophole.

518
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:30,116
Did your lips get as chapped as mine
on the ride down?

519
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,035
Never mind. l need your help.

520
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:35,622
There was a shootout at the thing.
The agents are dead !

521
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:38,416
-Dead?
-Yeah. They were after me, Charlie!

522
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:41,461
Oh, God. This is Dickie's work. l know it!

523
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,842
So what are you gonna do?

524
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:52,055
-We'll call the police.
-What? No, you can't do that!

525
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:56,267
Dickie has those guys in his back pocket.
That's why l came to you.

526
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,813
Hey! This is serious shit!

527
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,189
You don't. . .

528
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:05,026
-l'm outta here.
-Hey, wait! No, don't do that!

529
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,904
Come on, hold on.
Just let me think for a second. OK?

530
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:11,783
Think someplace else.
This is the first place they're gonna look.

531
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:13,827
Damn it!

532
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:23,628
So where are we going anyway?

533
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,130
You'll see.

534
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:32,303
Well, they went on the lam for a bit, and
then Charlie made a couple of phone calls.

535
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,774
Take it easy now.

536
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,569
-Charlie!
-Don't worry. l'll take care of it.

537
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,863
Hey.

538
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,323
-Good work, Baileygates.
-Thanks.

539
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,284
Sorry l had to meet you
all the way out here.

540
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:57,745
-That's OK.
-lt's just as well. Poor gal's paranoid.

541
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:02,041
My kids are like that. They have this idea
that the cops are the bad guys. . .

542
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:13,219
Listen, l don't know what's going on
and l didn't tell the feds anything. . .

543
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:16,764
Dickie told me you were street-smart.

544
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:19,726
Why the hell would you run to this idiot?

545
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,983
Drop the gun, moron.

546
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:29,235
You're being video-taped.

547
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:34,199
-What're you talking about?
-There's a camera on my bike.

548
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,914
Hard to hit a moving target, isn't it?

549
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:59,307
Score. Good move.

550
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,267
Get in the car.

551
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:05,104
Come on, come on, come on.

552
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:12,070
D'you mind telling me
what you were thinking?

553
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:14,781
Calling that cop was unbelievably stupid !

554
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:20,787
Tweak the high end
on your emotional EQ, sweetbeak.

555
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:23,414
The funky chicken was Charlie's dance.

556
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:26,084
l'm a tango man myself.

557
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:35,260
As you can imagine,
there was some explaining to do.

558
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:39,222
So Hank, as he called himself,

559
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:43,685
found a quiet spot
and spelled out the whole darn mess.

560
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:46,813
OK, so what you're saying
is that you're not Charlie.

561
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:51,568
You've seen Charlie in action.
He's like origami: folds under pressure.

562
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:54,821
When the big game's on the line,
he's busy riding the pine.

563
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,032
OK, wait. Can you just. . .

564
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:04,831
lt's simple.

565
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:07,333
Charlie's the mouse
that got you into the maze.

566
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:10,295
l'm the rat who can find the cheese.

567
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,715
The name's Hank. Hank Evans. . .

568
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:16,759
For little girls

569
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:20,430
So it's true. Charlie is a schizo.

570
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:25,018
l wouldn't know. l stay out of his business,
he stays out of mine.

571
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:27,395
Look.

572
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:33,818
Just because l rock
doesn't mean l'm made of stone.

573
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:38,156
l feel your fear. lt's coming through
like static on my heart radio.

574
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:42,744
Hank? Hank.

575
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:47,206
l really, really appreciate your help,

576
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:51,711
but is there any way that maybe we could
get Charlie back out here

577
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:53,546
for a little huddle?

578
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:56,049
No problem.

579
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:59,469
While you're at it, why not climb that pole
and take a piss on the power lines?

580
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:02,138
Look, l'm not here to twist your niblets.

581
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:07,435
l'm here to save your life, but if l'm gonna
do that, l'll need total uninononynymity.

582
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,275
OK.

583
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:16,986
Sound good, candypants?

584
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:20,073
Hank, don't call me that.

585
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,504
How the hell can they call Pluto a planet?

586
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:36,798
What motherfuckin' planet has
an elliptical orbit?

587
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:40,551
-This shit don't make sense.
-Motherfucker!

588
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:44,138
That motherfucker Vince Foster was
murdered. l told you that shit!

589
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:47,433
Hey, man, quit hackin' into
them goddamn Pentagon files.

590
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:51,979
Ain't no nevermind who them crooked
politicians be killin' . You need to study.

591
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:54,941
-What did Daddy tell you about snoopin'?
-Shit, yeah.

592
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:58,653
lf you keep fuckin' around,
you'll lose your Yale scholarship.

593
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:03,783
Be stuck up there at Stanford with
them goddamn motherfuckers.

594
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:06,035
Motherfucker, you be lucky
to get accepted to Duke,

595
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,912
gettin' a 1 430 on yo' SAT.

596
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:09,497
-Motherfucker, you know l had the flu.
-Flu, my ass!

597
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:12,834
You had a motherfuckin' aneurysm
to get a 1 430.

598
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:16,254
Hey, you talkin' some shit now.

599
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:19,632
That's probably one of them
lvy League sons of bitches now.

600
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:21,884
Show me yo' ass head up
and get the door, man.

601
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:27,515
Hey, Captain.

602
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:30,560
-Fellas.
-What the fuck is goin' on, man?

603
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:33,646
-This is Agent Annicelli.
-Gentlemen.

604
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:36,816
-What's happenin'?
-We've got a problem.

605
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:38,985
Pack your bags.

606
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:46,909
-We're locked and loaded.
-Great.

607
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:49,328
Got enough stuff
to hold us over for 72 hours.

608
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:06,304
Well, fuck my ozone.

609
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:25,239
We're gonna rock you

610
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:34,916
Hey, ringworm.

611
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:40,213
Yeah, l'm talkin' to you,
you toxic waste of life.

612
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:44,675
You gonna pick up that butt?

613
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:48,638
Or do l have to glue it to my shoe
and stick it in your pimply a-hole?

614
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:52,558
Hey, man. Take it easy.
lt's just a cigarette.

615
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:53,893
Oh, yeah?

616
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:59,482
Well, this is just a fist, but when l throw it
around, it can leave one hell of a mess.

617
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,818
Let's dance.

618
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:26,300
Let's kick the shit out of
this crazy asshole!

619
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:29,929
Wait, he's a schizo!

620
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:32,098
What the hell's wrong with him?

621
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:35,935
What happened anyway?

622
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:41,816
Yeah, Charlie was taking a few lumps
on account of Hank's behavior.

623
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:46,153
But, save for a little blood in the urine,
he was no worse for the wear.

624
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:51,617
l'm sorry you had to meet Hank,
Miss Waters.

625
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:52,994
l thought l was bad.

626
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:56,414
That guy has some serious problems.

627
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:59,750
He did save our lives.

628
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,881
Anyway, Hank had a good idea.
He thinks. . .

629
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:06,382
You're gonna listen to Hank?

630
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:10,970
Come on, look what he did to me!
What are you thinking? He's out of control.

631
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:14,724
You know what we should do?

632
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:18,603
Find another department
and tell them the whole story.

633
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:22,523
Not smart, Charlie. We don't know how far
Dickie's reach goes.

634
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:26,485
Then you know what?

635
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:30,990
l think it's time to call the best damn
law enforcement agency in the country.

636
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:33,492
The Rhode lsland State Troopers!

637
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:34,619
Do you really think

638
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:38,164
that the feds don't have some guy
up there right now, bugging calls?

639
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:43,252
They'd be on us in 1 0 minutes. And they
almost got me killed in the first place.

640
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:45,338
OK.

641
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,715
What was the genius's big plan?

642
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:51,218
He thinks that we should find a cabin
and hide out for a while.

643
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,846
Oh, yeah?
What about water and food and. . .

644
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:57,016
He already got supplies.
They're in the trunk.

645
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:09,695
These are the supplies?

646
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:15,326
Well, he had a plan, all right.

647
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:19,121
That's it? That's all he got?

648
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:21,207
Oh, no. There's more.

649
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:23,668
A rope,

650
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:25,461
shovel,

651
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:29,507
bag of lime and some lawn darts.

652
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:35,972
This is Christine DiCarlo live
from Clinton County, New York,

653
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:40,059
where the manhunt continues for
Rhode lsland State Trooper Baileygates.

654
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:42,478
. . .responsible for the death
of an EPA agent

655
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:44,105
and the kidnapping of lrene Waters.

656
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:48,693
Bullshit! My daddy ain't killed nobody
and he sure ain't kidnapped no bitch !

657
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:51,153
Your dad's sick, mentally.
He's had a breakdown.

658
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:55,324
The important thing is we find him
so nobody else gets hurt.

659
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:57,535
Nobody's gonna get hurt.

660
00:49:57,619 --> 00:50:00,037
Our daddy wouldn't
hurt a motherfuckin' fly.

661
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:02,081
No, he goes after bigger game.

662
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:05,418
We just got a report he put six bullets
into a cow's head.

663
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,753
Poor thing's lucky to be alive.

664
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:13,551
OK, look, let's say he does have a problem,
which he don't.

665
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:15,302
He's been takin' pills.

666
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:19,306
-He left his pills in the hotel room.
-That's where he left his sanity.

667
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:22,226
l've seen it first-hand.
The guy's nuttier than squirrel turds.

668
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:26,105
One thing l don't understand, Lieutenant.

669
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:30,109
lf my daddy's such a scary-ass
motherfucker, why'd you go by yourself?

670
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:34,321
Who the fuck are you? Sergeant York
taking on the Germans yourself?

671
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:37,700
Your father's a police officer.
He asked me to come alone.

672
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:41,037
-How was l to know he's a nutcase?
-He ain't no fuckin' nutcase!

673
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:45,458
He may have delusionary schizophrenia
with involuntary narcissistic rage,

674
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:47,835
but he is a very gentle person.

675
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:50,212
Motherfucker robot! Motherfucker robot!

676
00:50:58,138 --> 00:50:59,638
What's the fuss?

677
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,390
Stay away from me, Hank!

678
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:05,227
l know what you had planned.
l saw your so-called supplies.

679
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:09,648
That.

680
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:14,236
l wasn't gonna just ram it home, though.

681
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:16,405
l was gonna lube it up

682
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:19,992
and ease it in there inch by inch
like a gentleman.

683
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:23,329
l was talking about the shovel
and the lime.

684
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,623
Shovel and lime?

685
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:37,009
Thank you.
l haven't laughed like that in a long time.

686
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:39,428
What's so funny?

687
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:42,139
-We're driving a hot carriage.
-So?

688
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,433
That stuff belongs to the bad cop.

689
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:48,562
You think he was gonna take
our dead bodies down to the station?

690
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:59,156
lrene decided they should
go back to Rhode lsland,

691
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:01,826
but Hank had an idea first.

692
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:04,161
Are you sure about this?

693
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:08,290
You kidding? Every oinker east of the
Mississippi will be looking for this sled.

694
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:10,000
Safer to go mass transit.

695
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:12,044
Ready? On nine.

696
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,588
1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 , 8, 9.

697
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:32,565
Well, they won't be tracking us in that car.

698
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:35,151
-Thanks for the kudos.
-Sure.

699
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:38,195
-Glad we're finally on the same page.
-Me, too.

700
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:43,492
-You OK?
-Yes, l'm fine.

701
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:48,372
Thought you were going over the edge.

702
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:49,790
Thank you.

703
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:57,047
You know, l think
you're a very special unit.

704
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:58,507
That's sweet.

705
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:02,052
l hope we can
get to know each other better.

706
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,596
Yeah. Me too.

707
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:05,639
Do you swallow?

708
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:12,021
l get it. We'll go slow.

709
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:20,237
-Hey!
-Yes?

710
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:25,618
You didn't happen
to pick up a wallet on the dash, did you?

711
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:27,870
You're kidding, right?

712
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:33,709
So what's your tale? Where you from?

713
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:35,794
Oh, all over.

714
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:39,089
Omnipresence. l like that in a woman.

715
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:42,635
l'm originally from Texas.
Middle-class neighborhood.

716
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:45,054
But after school
l moved to New York 'cause. . .

717
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:48,140
Let me guess.
Everybody said you were easy on the eyes,

718
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:49,892
so you tried to become a model.

719
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:54,855
But in the Big Apple, they treated you
like the worm, so you became an actress.

720
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,815
No, but. . .

721
00:53:57,943 --> 00:53:59,944
But you can't get far without talent,

722
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:04,073
and the only bright lights you saw
were the ones inside the fridge.

723
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:08,202
So you got a boob job and went
looking for a rich man with a bum ticker

724
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:12,081
and waved a white flag
in the face of your own self-loathing.

725
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:17,920
-How's my aim?
-l never went to New York City.

726
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:21,757
l went to Cornell, then l got my master's
in Turf Management at U-Mass.

727
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:24,343
Then l became
a golf-course superintendent.

728
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:30,766
-And these are all mine.
-l notice you left out your eating disorder.

729
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:34,144
-l don't have an eating disorder.
-Whatever, slim.

730
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:41,277
Hands off, Hank.

731
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:52,454
Mom !

732
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:56,375
That's real nice, Hank.
Way to keep a low profile.

733
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:59,461
lt's survival at this point.

734
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:04,258
Hey, l know how to score some dough.

735
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:07,469
-Punch me.
-What?

736
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:10,139
-Punch me in the face.
-Why?

737
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:12,808
l'll tell the big cheese
l got rolled in the parking lot.

738
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:16,812
He'll hush me with some Benjamins.
They don't need that kind of ink.

739
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:18,897
Come on, rip my head off.

740
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:23,110
-That's really lame, Hank.
-You have a better idea? Come on !

741
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:26,822
-lt's not gonna work.
-Yes, it is, but you gotta rock me.

742
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:30,117
Don't give me a girly
"l don't want to break a fingernail" tap.

743
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:33,329
This guy's gotta look at my face and just. . .

744
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:41,712
Well, the kick in the chops
didn't work out as planned.

745
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:45,007
lt just left Charlie a little more roughed up.

746
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,592
How's the nose feeling?

747
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:48,635
Listen to it.

748
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:54,350
-l'm really sorry, Charlie.
-l'll get over it.

749
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:59,480
l mean, you should be furious.
l just drop-kicked you right in the face.

750
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:01,190
Hey, it happens.

751
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:07,780
You got a great way
of looking at life, Charlie. You know that?

752
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,365
That's a gift.

753
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:11,867
Yeah, l don't know
if my shrinks would agree.

754
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:13,535
They think that's my problem.

755
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,828
What?

756
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:21,627
That l purposely distort my perceptions
to make my reality more palatable.

757
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:24,922
Like you only hear what you wanna hear?

758
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:29,301
Thanks. l like to keep it short,
especially in the summer.

759
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:37,726
How come l couldn't have ended up with
an easy-going guy like you, Charlie? Huh?

760
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:43,107
Sometimes l think there's something
about my look that just attracts assholes.

761
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:44,650
That's crazy.

762
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:47,152
You're a very special girl, lrene.
Look at you.

763
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:48,946
You're just so down-to-earth.

764
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:52,699
l mean, look at your hair.
lt's like you don't give a damn.

765
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:57,663
And you let your skin hang out, blemishes
an' all. You're not afraid of your flaws.

766
00:56:57,747 --> 00:57:01,542
Your face is all pursed up
like you just sucked on a lemon,

767
00:57:01,626 --> 00:57:03,377
but you pull it off!

768
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:15,013
You thinkin' what l'm thinkin'?

769
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:18,767
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yeah.

770
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:24,064
Come on !

771
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:28,318
-l don't know if l can !
-Yes, you can !

772
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:30,904
Humans only use 1 0% of their potential !

773
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:33,866
You gotta reach down
for that little extra something !

774
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:40,330
There you go!

775
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:42,541
Now you're gettin' it!

776
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,251
l believe in you !

777
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:48,088
Don't you give up on me now!

778
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:56,555
Easier than l thought! Come on !

779
00:57:57,390 --> 00:58:00,184
Go, Charlie. Go! You can do it!

780
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:01,894
Come on, Charlie!

781
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:04,813
Use more of your potential !

782
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:13,989
Come on, Charlie! Go!

783
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,782
Jump off!

784
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:18,076
-What?
-Jump off!

785
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:20,412
What?

786
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:23,415
Jump off the train !

787
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:33,467
lrene?

788
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,429
Come on. Stop fooling around.

789
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:41,099
l started thinking about it. Bad idea.

790
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:44,561
Trains are the first place they'll look.

791
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:46,688
Oh, come on.

792
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:51,985
We checked all the gas and food stops
along the interstate. No sign of 'em.

793
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:54,696
lnterstate! ls your old lady happy?

794
00:58:56,157 --> 00:58:57,533
My old lady?

795
00:58:57,617 --> 00:59:00,536
Cos if your fuckin' is like your police work,

796
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,497
you couldn't hit the G spot
on a 1 2lb pussy.

797
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:05,123
Watch yourself.

798
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,712
-What are you gettin' at?
-Look, Daddy ain't gonna take no road

799
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:13,423
where y'all blind-ass cops is lookin' .

800
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,842
And, motherfucker, he don't eat fast food.

801
00:59:19,013 --> 00:59:21,557
OK, l have three dollars.
How much do you have?

802
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:24,726
-Six bucks.
-Let me go up and order, so we can go.

803
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:28,188
OK. l'll have a chicken breast sandwich.
No skin, dry toast.

804
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:36,572
You make me dizzy
running circles in my head

805
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:43,495
One of these days l'll chase you down

806
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:46,248
Well, look who's going crazy now

807
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:48,834
We're face to face, my friend

808
00:59:49,335 --> 00:59:52,170
Better get out

809
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:54,840
Better get out!

810
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:59,303
-What are you starin' at, fucker?
-You know you make me break out. . .

811
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:02,014
Wanna start me up?
Just pull the cord, pal.

812
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:05,267
l'm due for a seismic event.
You're dancin' on the fault line.

813
01:00:05,643 --> 01:00:10,606
-Hey, what is your problem, pal?
-l got no beef with you. Just the kid.

814
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:13,275
-Hey, stop it!
-He started it.

815
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:16,695
l'm so sorry. l apologize.
He suffers from this thing.

816
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:18,196
l'm standing right here, four-eyes.

817
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:22,659
Oh, poor baby. Has to let his daddy
fight his battles for him, huh?

818
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:25,203
He's an ass.

819
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:33,587
Pussy.

820
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:41,011
How's it hangin' , fellas?

821
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:42,763
Hank, l presume.

822
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:48,268
-D'you miss me?
-Why don't you get Charlie back?

823
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:50,604
Things were finally becoming civilized.

824
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:54,691
Pocahontas, you gotta put your ear
to the ground to hear the buffelo.

825
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:56,902
l don't know what that means, OK?

826
01:00:57,111 --> 01:01:02,032
lt means either he makes up a battle plan,
or Hank'll take over Fort Charlie for good.

827
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:06,411
Did you just refer to yourself
in the fourth person?

828
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:09,956
Holy Jesus in heaven ! lt's a giant Q-Tip.

829
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:11,083
Hank!

830
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:14,711
What? l'm jokin' .
Bringin' a little sunshine into his life.

831
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:16,880
Careful, you'll peel.

832
01:01:17,256 --> 01:01:21,009
-Do you need to see a menu?
-No, thank you. We've ordered.

833
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:28,767
That's it.

834
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:31,395
Hold on, cheese tits.

835
01:01:31,562 --> 01:01:34,314
-Did l miss something?
-Don't give me that shit!

836
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:37,025
What you just did to that kid was terrible.

837
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:39,695
Didn't you see the look on his face?

838
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:44,741
Looked a little pale, that's all.

839
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:47,536
He was hurt and offended.

840
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:50,247
Well, l disagree, but why speculate?

841
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:53,792
-Hey, Milky! iVàmonos!
-Hey, no!

842
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:57,671
Come on, Br'er Rabbit. Hop down
the bunny trail. Epa, epa, àndale.

843
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:03,969
Listen, were you offended in any way
by our social interaction here?

844
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:06,596
Yeah, actually l was.

845
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:11,101
What was it? The Q-Tip thing?

846
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:15,230
Actually l was pretty much offended
by everything you said, sir.

847
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:23,739
Sorry.

848
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:29,244
l'm truly sorry.

849
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:52,142
You OK?

850
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:57,647
You don't know what it was like.

851
01:02:57,774 --> 01:03:01,610
Spending all those years
trapped behind a wall of politeness.

852
01:03:01,819 --> 01:03:03,737
Bound and gagged. . .

853
01:03:04,363 --> 01:03:08,200
ln a dark and silent world
where nothing grows but the anger.

854
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:14,206
All because some demon he married
laced up her boots

855
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:15,874
and did a Nancy Sinatra on him.

856
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:19,002
Charlie had a wife?

857
01:03:20,087 --> 01:03:21,630
And then some.

858
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:25,717
l was a big piece
of the personality pie back then.

859
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:28,720
But when she left him,
Charlie went numb. . .

860
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:30,680
And l went AWOL.

861
01:03:31,557 --> 01:03:32,808
Well,

862
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:37,729
if you were
such a big part of the personality,

863
01:03:38,689 --> 01:03:40,732
then she left you too.

864
01:03:48,699 --> 01:03:50,617
lt's true.

865
01:03:54,413 --> 01:03:56,122
She left us.

866
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:00,252
l loved her.

867
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:04,965
Why'd she do this?

868
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:12,472
l'm not a bad person.

869
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:15,725
No, you're not a bad guy.

870
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:17,769
No, you're not.

871
01:04:18,437 --> 01:04:19,938
D'you hear me?

872
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:26,111
You're a good person.

873
01:04:30,449 --> 01:04:32,284
You really think so?

874
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,745
Yeah, l'm starting to.

875
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:48,383
You know what l'm gonna do?

876
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:51,469
l'm gonna make it up to Charlie.

877
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:56,141
And l'm gonna make it up
to that sweet little circus geek in there.

878
01:04:59,186 --> 01:05:00,312
Hank?

879
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:03,398
Agent Boshane!

880
01:05:03,482 --> 01:05:07,027
They were spotted leaving a health-food
restaurant 1 00 miles from here.

881
01:05:07,111 --> 01:05:09,154
-1 5 minutes, tops.
-Got it.

882
01:05:16,495 --> 01:05:18,538
They got 1 50 cordoned off?

883
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:21,583
Let's fly!

884
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:44,189
Can you please tell him to stop this?

885
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:46,524
Charlie, is that you?

886
01:05:50,821 --> 01:05:52,280
Hey, my nose.

887
01:05:53,699 --> 01:05:55,367
My nose is fixed.

888
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:01,498
-lsn't that great?
-How'd that happen?

889
01:06:01,832 --> 01:06:06,294
Well, Hank wanted
to do something nice for you,

890
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:10,548
so he insisted that we
go to a plastic surgeon.

891
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:14,344
What? Did you say plastic surgeon?

892
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:16,638
Oh, my God.

893
01:06:17,556 --> 01:06:19,057
What is this?

894
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:21,434
What d'you. . . What is this?

895
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:26,439
Hank thought that you kinda
had a weak chin, so. . .

896
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:28,942
What?

897
01:06:30,194 --> 01:06:33,071
l like my chin. . .

898
01:06:33,864 --> 01:06:35,365
l like my chin.

899
01:06:35,449 --> 01:06:38,118
lt's my chin ! lt's my chin ! Mine!

900
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:39,869
How'd you pay for it?

901
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:41,913
l loaned him the money.

902
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:44,416
Who the hell are you?

903
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:46,668
lt's me.

904
01:06:47,294 --> 01:06:48,503
Milky.

905
01:06:53,634 --> 01:06:56,761
Who the hell is Milky
and what is he doing here?

906
01:06:58,931 --> 01:07:02,851
lrene has a lot of people who would like
to see her in an unmarked grave.

907
01:07:02,935 --> 01:07:05,603
l don't think it's safe
for you to hang around with us.

908
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:09,607
Why not?
You, lrene and Hank are my only friends.

909
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:13,486
What about your family?
Won't they miss you?

910
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:15,280
My family's all. . .

911
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:18,450
They're gone.

912
01:07:19,326 --> 01:07:20,618
Oh, jeez.

913
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:32,964
Well, we can't call you Milky anymore.
What's your real name?

914
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:35,884
Casper. But my friends call me Whitey.

915
01:07:38,012 --> 01:07:39,137
OK.

916
01:07:43,684 --> 01:07:48,480
l can't find the time to tell you

917
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:58,156
l can't find the time to tell you. . .

918
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:00,492
Whoa!

919
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:03,244
So many things to say

920
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:09,626
l could fit it in a book, fit it in a book
of a thousand pages, yeah

921
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:13,088
So many people say

922
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:18,426
That l couldn't tell a lie, couldn't tell a lie
in a thousand ages

923
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:22,180
-Here you go. l got your car all filled up.
-Thank you, Joseph.

924
01:08:24,725 --> 01:08:27,560
Oh, yeah.

925
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:32,941
Get your cock out of my Chrysler,
you son of a bitch !

926
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:39,155
You son of a. . .
l'm gonna kill you ! l'm gonna get you !

927
01:08:46,038 --> 01:08:50,667
l can't find the time to tell you

928
01:08:52,878 --> 01:08:55,839
l look at your pretty face

929
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:58,716
And l fall in love with you
Fall in love with you

930
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:02,971
Every time l see you there

931
01:09:05,724 --> 01:09:08,393
They are flowing to the ground
Flowing to the ground

932
01:09:08,477 --> 01:09:11,271
ln a mist around you

933
01:09:12,731 --> 01:09:21,156
Baby, you're wrong

934
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:22,740
What's that on your shirt?

935
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:27,120
l'm sorry.

936
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:30,748
That was good.

937
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:34,043
Charlie, what the hell is that?

938
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:38,089
-Oh, yeah, l'm gonna fall for that.
-No, Charlie.

939
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:40,216
Not me.

940
01:09:40,926 --> 01:09:42,594
Nice try though.

941
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:44,929
How dumb do l look?

942
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:57,692
l can't find the time to tell you

943
01:09:57,943 --> 01:10:02,697
l can't find the time to tell you. . .

944
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:08,203
Hey, they only had two rooms: 1 9 and 20.

945
01:10:08,287 --> 01:10:10,413
So you guys will have to bunk up.

946
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:17,879
l can't find the time to tell you

947
01:10:23,427 --> 01:10:24,886
So, Whitey. . .

948
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:28,765
What happened to your family?

949
01:10:28,849 --> 01:10:30,391
l killed them.

950
01:10:32,519 --> 01:10:33,978
Come again?

951
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:38,566
When l was 1 5, l hacked them up
with a hammer while they were sleeping.

952
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:42,111
Ma, Dad, my bro and my sis.

953
01:10:45,115 --> 01:10:47,033
She was awake, my sis.

954
01:10:49,286 --> 01:10:50,828
Which l regret.

955
01:10:52,831 --> 01:10:54,749
Yeah, well. . .

956
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:59,379
We all have family stuff.

957
01:11:00,881 --> 01:11:04,676
That's what makes the holidays so hard.

958
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:08,054
l just got released last month
on my 21 st birthday.

959
01:11:09,139 --> 01:11:14,644
To tell you the truth, l really wasn't ready
to leave, but they said l had to.

960
01:11:17,189 --> 01:11:18,940
That's a fucked-up law, huh?

961
01:11:21,235 --> 01:11:25,029
Well, l guess they need the extra room
for the real. . .

962
01:11:25,739 --> 01:11:27,031
Psychos.

963
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:29,867
l'm gonna go and try to make out
with whatsherface.

964
01:11:30,035 --> 01:11:31,869
-Go for it.
-All right!

965
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:33,788
-What?
-Yeah.

966
01:11:33,872 --> 01:11:39,627
He just told me that he brutally murdered
his entire family in their sleep!

967
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:43,548
-Oh, my God !
-He was a juvenile. They just let him out.

968
01:11:45,384 --> 01:11:50,430
So, l was gonna ask if l could. . .

969
01:11:50,514 --> 01:11:51,889
Stay here.

970
01:11:53,058 --> 01:11:55,184
But l can sleep in the car.

971
01:12:00,441 --> 01:12:03,484
That's me and my whippersnappers.
l'm Dorothy.

972
01:12:04,653 --> 01:12:06,279
Look at you !

973
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:11,868
When did you take this? At Halloween?

974
01:12:11,952 --> 01:12:14,412
No. Just messing around the house.

975
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:21,919
You seem like a really good dad, Charlie.

976
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:26,799
l try to be.

977
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:31,554
They're incredible kids. Oh, God.

978
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:36,184
So happy and funny.
They never give me any grief.

979
01:12:37,644 --> 01:12:41,647
-They're the top three students out of 21 1 .
-Golly!

980
01:12:41,732 --> 01:12:45,651
-l don't know where they get it from.
-That's just good genes.

981
01:12:49,156 --> 01:12:54,035
You know, l don't think l. . . No, l don't think
l carry even one picture anymore.

982
01:12:54,828 --> 01:12:57,538
-Why not?
-l don't know.

983
01:12:57,623 --> 01:13:02,460
l used to when l was younger.
Pictures of friends and stuff like that.

984
01:13:02,961 --> 01:13:06,005
l guess they just got old and fell apart.

985
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:10,676
Kind of like the friendships.

986
01:13:12,638 --> 01:13:14,555
That's too bad.

987
01:13:20,145 --> 01:13:24,357
-Tell you what. Why not keep that one?
-No, Charlie. That's yours.

988
01:13:24,441 --> 01:13:28,236
Are you kidding? l have tons of them
at home. No, l got a bunch. Come on.

989
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:29,654
-You do?
-Yeah.

990
01:13:31,156 --> 01:13:32,281
OK.

991
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:38,496
Thanks.

992
01:13:52,845 --> 01:13:54,137
l'm dry.

993
01:13:56,390 --> 01:14:00,393
You know, l'm gonna go get a soda.

994
01:14:01,353 --> 01:14:04,814
-You want a soda?
-Sure. OK.

995
01:14:26,378 --> 01:14:29,755
l caught that, bozo.
Not once but twice it burned ya.

996
01:14:34,052 --> 01:14:36,304
Give it another kick.

997
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:46,439
-l think l just had an epiphany!
-What?

998
01:14:47,232 --> 01:14:50,276
That l might be able to control
this problem of mine.

999
01:14:50,444 --> 01:14:52,028
How'd you learn that?

1000
01:14:52,863 --> 01:14:56,574
First the Coke machine robbed me.
And l'm fine with that.

1001
01:14:56,742 --> 01:14:59,660
But then some guy came up
and laughed in my face.

1002
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:02,663
-Oh, no.
-No, no, but that's just it!

1003
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:06,667
See? Just when l was starting to feel
those old familiar feelings,

1004
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:11,380
l just took a deep breath, counted
backwards from 1 0 and l said to the guy

1005
01:15:11,465 --> 01:15:15,009
"Excuse me, sir, but your laughter
is not helping me right now."

1006
01:15:15,093 --> 01:15:18,179
And he said
"l'm sorry. l didn't mean to make fun."

1007
01:15:18,305 --> 01:15:21,265
That was it! l helped him with his bags.

1008
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:23,100
-Really?
-Yes.

1009
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:25,520
Well, that's great!

1010
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:27,605
And you got the Cokes.

1011
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:30,566
Just a little rap on the side
of the machine and presto!

1012
01:15:31,652 --> 01:15:33,778
Maybe that's it though, you know?

1013
01:15:35,948 --> 01:15:40,993
-Look what l found in my bag.
-Oh, no! Oh, boy.

1014
01:15:41,078 --> 01:15:43,204
What do you think? Do you?

1015
01:15:43,288 --> 01:15:47,542
Under the right circumstances,
sure, l could tip a few.

1016
01:15:48,752 --> 01:15:51,337
And these are the right circumstances.

1017
01:15:52,631 --> 01:15:53,756
There you go.

1018
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:57,426
-Celebrate good times, come on.
-Oh, well.

1019
01:15:57,511 --> 01:15:59,512
Whoa, that must be mine!

1020
01:16:52,524 --> 01:16:54,108
Jesus! Oh, God.

1021
01:16:54,818 --> 01:16:56,736
Oh, my God !

1022
01:17:13,253 --> 01:17:14,545
lrene?

1023
01:17:17,591 --> 01:17:20,384
Why am l peeing
like l was up all night having sex?

1024
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:24,430
Well, seems old Hank
had pulled a fast one.

1025
01:17:24,514 --> 01:17:29,769
And if that wasn't bad enough, there was
more trouble right around the corner.

1026
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:35,650
l want everybody to stay put
and wait for my order.

1027
01:17:36,151 --> 01:17:40,237
-You mean you couldn't tell the difference?
-Are you serious?

1028
01:17:41,865 --> 01:17:45,201
-Who the hell could?
-A sober person for one.

1029
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:48,162
So we had some drinks.

1030
01:17:55,879 --> 01:17:58,255
Well, look who joined the party.

1031
01:18:00,634 --> 01:18:04,428
Did you have fun?
"Ooh, yes, l did ! Ooh, yes l did !"

1032
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:07,932
So old Hanky-Panky
wasn't enough for you, huh?

1033
01:18:09,309 --> 01:18:11,018
lt wasn't for me.

1034
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:18,484
-Are you sure this is the woman?
-Absolutely.

1035
01:18:18,610 --> 01:18:23,197
When my boyfriend Scooter brought in
the paper, l recognized her right away.

1036
01:18:25,075 --> 01:18:26,951
Thanks a lot. Scooter.

1037
01:18:35,127 --> 01:18:38,003
-Here they come.
-Look, Starsky and Hutch, this is the plan.

1038
01:18:38,088 --> 01:18:41,090
Let us talk to our dad
so this ain't gotta be no big thing.

1039
01:18:41,174 --> 01:18:43,342
Thanks, but this is
the end of the line for you.

1040
01:18:43,427 --> 01:18:46,220
Officer Stubie'll drive you to the chopper.

1041
01:18:46,304 --> 01:18:49,181
What? You brung us all the way down
for us to leave now?

1042
01:18:49,266 --> 01:18:53,728
-That don't make no motherfuckin' sense!
-You've done all you can do.

1043
01:18:53,812 --> 01:18:55,896
This is a police matter from now on.

1044
01:18:55,981 --> 01:18:58,357
Wait. lt may be a police matter to you,

1045
01:18:58,442 --> 01:19:01,193
but the police don't matter shit to me
when it's my daddy in there!

1046
01:19:01,945 --> 01:19:05,906
l said you're gettin' the hell outta here.
That's the end of it.

1047
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:11,746
Guys, look, l'm sorry.
l hate to admit it, but this time he's right.

1048
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:15,499
-You can't be here. lt's a liability.
-He's the fuckin' liability!

1049
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:19,420
Don't worry. This is my investigation.
l promise there will be no bloodshed.

1050
01:19:19,504 --> 01:19:20,921
l promise!

1051
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:24,550
Come on, guys. Let's go.

1052
01:19:29,181 --> 01:19:31,015
You OK, Charlie?

1053
01:19:31,933 --> 01:19:33,851
Yeah. l'm just. . .

1054
01:19:34,895 --> 01:19:35,978
Freshening up!

1055
01:19:40,984 --> 01:19:43,110
How do you wanna handle it?

1056
01:19:45,489 --> 01:19:48,616
l say we storm the place
and start shooting.

1057
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:52,119
-What if he's unarmed?
-Plant a gun on him afterwards.

1058
01:19:57,709 --> 01:19:59,835
Don't fuck it up this time.

1059
01:20:21,858 --> 01:20:23,776
Agent Boshane!

1060
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:28,239
lt's Stubie.
He's got Baileygates and the girl.

1061
01:20:28,573 --> 01:20:29,740
What?

1062
01:20:34,746 --> 01:20:36,664
This is Boshane. What's going on?

1063
01:20:36,748 --> 01:20:40,334
l caught 'em out on 1 34 in a stolen vehicle.
Baileygates and the girl.

1064
01:20:40,418 --> 01:20:43,754
Officer Stubie,
l don't want you to attempt to move them.

1065
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:47,675
-Don't move them ! We'll be right there.
-Get in your cars. Come on !

1066
01:20:49,469 --> 01:20:53,806
We sure is sorry, Officer,
but our daddy told us to trust our instinct,

1067
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:57,268
and our instinct says
somethin' don't smell right. Let's roll.

1068
01:20:57,352 --> 01:20:59,270
You guys are making a big mistake!

1069
01:21:00,188 --> 01:21:01,689
'Cause l promise you,
when l find your old man,

1070
01:21:01,773 --> 01:21:04,191
l'm personally gonna fuck him up!

1071
01:21:08,488 --> 01:21:11,323
Why'd you go an' say
somethin' like that for, huh?

1072
01:21:11,408 --> 01:21:12,783
Lee Harvey.

1073
01:21:13,118 --> 01:21:15,661
-What's the diameter of a chicken egg?
-4.08cm.

1074
01:21:15,745 --> 01:21:19,081
-No, what's that in inches?
-1 .61 . What the fuck you gettin' at?

1075
01:21:19,165 --> 01:21:22,418
l got 1 0 bucks say
l can squeeze a chicken egg up his ass.

1076
01:21:22,502 --> 01:21:25,713
You can't put no chicken egg up his ass.
He's a tightass!

1077
01:21:25,797 --> 01:21:28,048
-No, it can be done.
-Yo, l'll take that bet.

1078
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:30,050
-Right on.
-Pull yo' ass out!

1079
01:21:38,935 --> 01:21:40,060
l'll tell you one thing.

1080
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:42,938
lf l didn't have bad luck,
l'd have no luck at all.

1081
01:21:43,023 --> 01:21:44,940
What are we gonna do about Whitey?

1082
01:21:45,025 --> 01:21:47,401
Take a guess. We're going on without him.

1083
01:21:47,485 --> 01:21:48,819
Moody.

1084
01:21:49,487 --> 01:21:51,655
Well, l didn't have
the fun you had last night.

1085
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:54,867
Just the hangover
and the swollen prostate.

1086
01:21:54,951 --> 01:21:59,413
-D'you have any cash left?
-Yes. $60 , but it's Whitey's.

1087
01:21:59,497 --> 01:22:04,084
Yeah, well, bad things happen to people
who kill their family with a hammer.

1088
01:22:09,507 --> 01:22:12,134
-l'm payin' under protest.
-lt was close enough.

1089
01:22:12,218 --> 01:22:14,178
Yeah, whatever.

1090
01:22:16,389 --> 01:22:17,431
Shit.

1091
01:22:17,515 --> 01:22:20,517
Give me the scanner, so we can find out
what the fuck's goin' on !

1092
01:22:20,602 --> 01:22:22,978
Anybody know how to fly this thing?

1093
01:22:23,188 --> 01:22:26,440
Motherfucker, it's just lift
versus drag and rotation !

1094
01:22:26,524 --> 01:22:30,277
-Yeah, get your head out your ass!
-lt ain't that. This manual's in German.

1095
01:22:30,362 --> 01:22:35,282
-Motherfucker, you speak German !
-l can speak it. l didn't say l could read it!

1096
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:37,701
You's a motherfuckin' disgrace!

1097
01:22:47,045 --> 01:22:49,129
Then get this motherfucker off the ground !

1098
01:22:49,214 --> 01:22:51,840
All right! Oh, shit!

1099
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:11,068
Jesus!

1100
01:23:14,364 --> 01:23:18,200
Would somebody get this goddamn
chicken out of my ass, please?

1101
01:23:31,631 --> 01:23:36,427
Everybody, stay back. We'll do this alone.
l'll take 1 9 , you take 20 . Stay back!

1102
01:23:44,936 --> 01:23:46,854
Goddamn it!

1103
01:23:49,441 --> 01:23:52,568
Sons of bitches, l'll show 'em.
Sons of bitches.

1104
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:57,865
-l need a gun and lots of ammo.
-Sorry.

1105
01:23:57,949 --> 01:24:00,159
72-hour wait. Federal law.

1106
01:24:00,243 --> 01:24:04,121
-How far am l from Rhode lsland?
-Four or five hours.

1107
01:24:04,497 --> 01:24:07,875
Got a map of New England,
if you want. $1 .95.

1108
01:24:09,586 --> 01:24:12,713
-Here's a five. Keep the change.
-Thanks.

1109
01:24:23,975 --> 01:24:26,310
-Hello.
-Finneran, it's Charlie.

1110
01:24:26,394 --> 01:24:29,605
Charlie, you are in deep shit.
Where the hell are you?

1111
01:24:29,689 --> 01:24:32,066
Listen, you gotta get a message
to the colonel.

1112
01:24:32,317 --> 01:24:35,569
But no one outside the department
can know about this, OK?

1113
01:24:35,653 --> 01:24:37,488
'Cause this is deep.

1114
01:24:37,655 --> 01:24:41,158
4.30 , South County train station.
Bring plenty of backup. You got it.

1115
01:24:41,785 --> 01:24:44,745
Don't worry. Nobody outside
the department will hear about this.

1116
01:24:44,829 --> 01:24:46,747
Watch yourself, buddy.

1117
01:24:49,584 --> 01:24:51,293
4.30, huh?

1118
01:24:51,377 --> 01:24:54,838
Thanks for notitying us, Officer.
No, you've been a really big help.

1119
01:24:55,673 --> 01:24:57,800
-You stay close.
-Yes, sir.

1120
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:00,469
Excuse me.

1121
01:25:01,805 --> 01:25:05,140
-Where's Dickie?
-He's waiting for us in Boston.

1122
01:25:05,433 --> 01:25:08,352
l think it's time
our rich boy got his hands dirty.

1123
01:25:11,064 --> 01:25:12,314
Tell me.

1124
01:25:12,690 --> 01:25:14,024
How was. . .

1125
01:25:14,567 --> 01:25:16,068
Mr. Wonderful?

1126
01:25:16,653 --> 01:25:20,989
This is getting really ridiculous, Charlie,
so just let it go.

1127
01:25:22,033 --> 01:25:25,536
l turn my back for one minute
and you stick it up my ass! Literally!

1128
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:28,872
For your information,
you stuck it in your own ass!

1129
01:25:30,708 --> 01:25:35,546
Don't turn this around on me, OK? You're
the one who can't keep your legs closed.

1130
01:25:44,305 --> 01:25:48,267
-Why are you doing this?
-Because l l. . .ike you.

1131
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:55,065
What?

1132
01:25:58,444 --> 01:26:12,749
l like you.

1133
01:26:14,043 --> 01:26:16,253
Well, you shouldn't, Charlie.

1134
01:26:17,297 --> 01:26:19,006
l'm just a ditz.

1135
01:26:20,717 --> 01:26:24,219
A ditz? What are you talking about?
You're 27 years old.

1136
01:26:24,304 --> 01:26:27,306
You're the superintendent
of a major golf resort.

1137
01:26:28,266 --> 01:26:33,270
Yeah, well, l kind of fudged my résumé
a little bit to get that job.

1138
01:26:34,939 --> 01:26:40,110
Look, l don't know the first thing about
running a golf course, Charlie. l'm a model.

1139
01:26:42,447 --> 01:26:44,865
l moved to New York,
but none of it worked out,

1140
01:26:44,949 --> 01:26:47,659
so then l tried to be an actress and. . .

1141
01:26:48,661 --> 01:26:52,331
l got this eating disorder
where l gained, like, 20lb.

1142
01:26:52,624 --> 01:26:54,499
-That's not that bad.
-ln a week.

1143
01:26:56,461 --> 01:26:59,129
So l kind of lost my self-respect.

1144
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:03,550
Before you know it, l had 70-year-old guys
trying to support me

1145
01:27:03,635 --> 01:27:06,553
and l really didn't like
who l was becoming.

1146
01:27:10,058 --> 01:27:13,602
God, l have made so many mistakes.

1147
01:27:15,647 --> 01:27:16,855
lrene. . .

1148
01:27:19,442 --> 01:27:23,111
You didn't know what Dickie was up to.
Did you?

1149
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:27,157
l may be a ditz, but l'm not a crook.

1150
01:27:39,921 --> 01:27:43,131
When we met, light was set

1151
01:27:43,216 --> 01:27:44,925
Thoughts free flow

1152
01:27:45,009 --> 01:27:48,303
You said you've got something

1153
01:27:49,097 --> 01:27:51,181
Deep inside of you

1154
01:27:51,849 --> 01:27:54,768
A wind-chime voice sounds

1155
01:27:54,852 --> 01:27:58,021
Sway of your hips 'round rings true

1156
01:27:58,189 --> 01:27:59,773
My ass is really sore.

1157
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:02,693
lt goes deep inside of you

1158
01:28:12,870 --> 01:28:13,954
Wow!

1159
01:28:16,582 --> 01:28:19,084
l never get tired of hearing that.

1160
01:28:35,601 --> 01:28:36,685
Hey.

1161
01:28:37,854 --> 01:28:41,064
l'm lookin' for my friends.
A pretty blonde and a guy with a buzz cut.

1162
01:28:41,232 --> 01:28:43,233
-Cabin E.
-Thanks a lot.

1163
01:28:55,079 --> 01:28:56,955
Don't make a sound.

1164
01:28:57,081 --> 01:29:00,292
l don't know anything,
and that's what l told the police.

1165
01:29:00,376 --> 01:29:04,713
Shut up, lrene! You just listen to me.
Maybe we can work something out.

1166
01:29:08,092 --> 01:29:11,428
Time to face the music, Mozart.
And one, and two, and. . .

1167
01:29:32,784 --> 01:29:35,494
Warden, l want my own cell.

1168
01:29:36,371 --> 01:29:38,455
Great. You again.

1169
01:29:40,958 --> 01:29:45,712
-What tree did this sap ooze out of?
-lt's Dickie! He got me into all this crap!

1170
01:29:45,797 --> 01:29:47,381
-Oh, your golf buddy.
-Yeah.

1171
01:29:47,757 --> 01:29:50,258
-l hope it's OK if l play through.
-Hank!

1172
01:29:50,343 --> 01:29:53,136
-OK, turn around. l'll play the back nine.
-Stop it!

1173
01:29:53,221 --> 01:29:56,181
Come on. He couldn't have
chewed up the greens that badly.

1174
01:29:56,265 --> 01:29:57,557
Get away from me!

1175
01:29:57,642 --> 01:30:02,354
He hasn't played the course in a long time.
lt was Charlie who was putting.

1176
01:30:03,106 --> 01:30:04,523
-Charlie?
-Yeah.

1177
01:30:04,607 --> 01:30:07,943
He might not be long on the tee,
but he's got a good up-and-down game.

1178
01:30:08,027 --> 01:30:10,737
What's that suppo. . .
Can we speak English?

1179
01:30:10,822 --> 01:30:15,117
l never wanted to sleep with you, Hank!
OK? You tricked me!

1180
01:30:15,201 --> 01:30:19,579
That's right, l did trick you. lt was
deceitful, disgusting and despicable.

1181
01:30:19,664 --> 01:30:22,499
But just this once,
try to look at it from my side.

1182
01:30:22,583 --> 01:30:24,042
l was horny.

1183
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:26,002
Oh, God !

1184
01:30:26,087 --> 01:30:28,088
You are such an asshole!

1185
01:30:28,172 --> 01:30:30,715
Come on.
Don't be mad, my little pussyfart.

1186
01:30:34,762 --> 01:30:36,888
l warned you about that, buddy!

1187
01:30:37,348 --> 01:30:39,307
Warned me about what?

1188
01:30:41,227 --> 01:30:43,437
Charlie?

1189
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:47,190
Providence, Rhode lsland.
Ten-minute stop.

1190
01:30:48,609 --> 01:30:49,651
Did you. . .

1191
01:30:49,735 --> 01:30:51,278
-What?
-What's going on?

1192
01:30:51,362 --> 01:30:53,697
-Hank was coming on to me again.
-Hank!

1193
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:57,367
Damn it. l am so sick of that guy!

1194
01:30:58,327 --> 01:31:02,038
OK, Hank, come out here. Let's settle this
the old-fashioned way. Come on !

1195
01:31:02,498 --> 01:31:05,375
l may not be tough,
but damn it, l can get good and mad !

1196
01:31:06,169 --> 01:31:08,086
Stop it, man. You're scaring me.

1197
01:31:09,005 --> 01:31:11,506
-What's the matter?
-Let's go before he wakes up.

1198
01:31:11,591 --> 01:31:14,718
l'm not through with you, buster.
l'm not through with you !

1199
01:31:22,226 --> 01:31:25,353
What's the matter, Hank?
Afraid to pick on someone your own size?

1200
01:31:28,065 --> 01:31:30,942
Are you OK? What happened?

1201
01:31:31,194 --> 01:31:32,611
That was dirty.

1202
01:31:32,737 --> 01:31:34,863
All right. Come on.

1203
01:31:35,072 --> 01:31:36,990
Where are you? Where are you?

1204
01:31:37,366 --> 01:31:39,326
Here l am.

1205
01:31:39,410 --> 01:31:41,036
You bastard !

1206
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:46,374
Stop it, you're gonna kill him !

1207
01:31:48,085 --> 01:31:51,922
You're choking me!
You're choking me!

1208
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:54,257
Charlie, don't break it.

1209
01:31:54,634 --> 01:31:57,052
Get on your knees and beg me. Up yours.

1210
01:32:04,352 --> 01:32:07,020
On your feet. We're gonna have fun.

1211
01:32:07,313 --> 01:32:08,772
lrene!

1212
01:32:13,110 --> 01:32:17,113
Hi, ladies. My name is Charlie Baileygates.
Wanna see my weasel?

1213
01:32:21,911 --> 01:32:25,455
Free hot dogs here. All you can eat.
Get your foot-long and a bag of nuts.

1214
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:29,793
No! Don't listen to him !
lt's not me! lt's Hank!

1215
01:32:29,877 --> 01:32:31,294
lt's Hank!

1216
01:32:34,465 --> 01:32:38,134
Come back here, Hank!
l'm not through with you !

1217
01:32:45,768 --> 01:32:48,144
Had enough? Up yours.

1218
01:32:52,817 --> 01:32:54,442
Stop it, you two!

1219
01:32:58,990 --> 01:33:03,243
-lt's Gerke! Come on !
-Hank, truce? For now, fucker.

1220
01:33:09,834 --> 01:33:12,252
Watch out! He's got a gun !

1221
01:33:12,712 --> 01:33:15,589
l'll follow the girl. You get Baileygates!

1222
01:33:21,596 --> 01:33:24,764
Police officer! Everybody down ! Get down !

1223
01:33:32,773 --> 01:33:34,024
Outta the way!

1224
01:33:37,862 --> 01:33:41,531
Hank, we're shot!
You pussy, it's just a flesh wound. Look.

1225
01:33:52,209 --> 01:33:56,963
Look, there's keys in that car.
No, l can't go on.

1226
01:33:58,382 --> 01:34:00,592
l think. . .

1227
01:34:01,427 --> 01:34:04,137
l think l'm gonna faint.

1228
01:34:11,646 --> 01:34:15,023
Do you mean to say
l've gotta carry your sorry ass?

1229
01:34:16,233 --> 01:34:17,567
All right.

1230
01:34:18,527 --> 01:34:21,071
Come on, Rip Van Wussy.

1231
01:34:24,617 --> 01:34:26,368
Jesus, you're heavy.

1232
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:33,583
Now get in there!

1233
01:34:42,093 --> 01:34:43,635
And we're gone.

1234
01:34:47,598 --> 01:34:49,432
Shit! Don't worry.

1235
01:34:53,270 --> 01:34:58,441
Hank, what have you done? Oh, my God !
Don't you just love it?

1236
01:35:17,837 --> 01:35:20,046
You are a sick pup.

1237
01:35:20,131 --> 01:35:22,382
Yeah, well, takes one to know one.

1238
01:35:22,466 --> 01:35:24,384
What are you doing? Hank?

1239
01:35:26,137 --> 01:35:27,721
Ever been bitch-slapped?

1240
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:31,224
l'm gonna kill you, Hank! l swear to God !

1241
01:35:33,018 --> 01:35:35,854
Arrivederci, deadwood. No!

1242
01:36:23,319 --> 01:36:27,781
What are you still doin' here?
Hank, we're in this together.

1243
01:36:34,914 --> 01:36:36,498
Pritchard.

1244
01:36:36,665 --> 01:36:39,918
Cover the other end.
l want Charlie arrested on sight.

1245
01:37:14,662 --> 01:37:17,372
Hey, lrene. You just keep walking, now.

1246
01:37:28,801 --> 01:37:29,968
lrene!

1247
01:37:36,642 --> 01:37:38,685
Baileygates, you're coming with me.

1248
01:37:38,769 --> 01:37:40,436
-Not now, Finneran.
-Yes, now!

1249
01:37:43,566 --> 01:37:46,526
That was me.
Yeah, big deal.

1250
01:37:46,610 --> 01:37:49,279
-Shut up, Hank! You're so. . .
-Hank!

1251
01:37:50,114 --> 01:37:53,157
-Hank!
-Hey! Let her go!

1252
01:37:53,450 --> 01:37:56,119
She asked for me, asshole.
Big deal !

1253
01:38:00,916 --> 01:38:03,459
Dickie, you know l don't know anything !

1254
01:38:03,544 --> 01:38:05,461
Shut up, lrene. lt's too late.

1255
01:38:13,304 --> 01:38:18,224
Hank!

1256
01:38:18,642 --> 01:38:20,435
-No way.
-Come on.

1257
01:38:30,905 --> 01:38:35,283
Oh, no. Water.
Yeah. She's screwed. l'll buy you a beer.

1258
01:38:35,534 --> 01:38:37,535
No! We're doin' it!

1259
01:38:40,205 --> 01:38:41,372
Hank!

1260
01:38:42,249 --> 01:38:45,627
Hank! What are you doing?
Give me the leg !

1261
01:38:46,670 --> 01:38:48,379
Hank, hurry!

1262
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:51,591
This is my body!

1263
01:38:51,675 --> 01:38:54,010
Do you understand that?

1264
01:38:54,219 --> 01:38:55,845
l call the shots from now on, Hank!

1265
01:38:56,096 --> 01:38:58,222
l don't need you
to fight my battles for me!

1266
01:38:58,307 --> 01:39:02,018
lf you can back down from something
this important, you're nothing at all !

1267
01:39:02,394 --> 01:39:04,979
You're nothing at all !

1268
01:39:09,860 --> 01:39:11,486
l got my leg back.

1269
01:39:11,654 --> 01:39:14,113
Oh, no. Hank!

1270
01:39:14,281 --> 01:39:16,032
l'm coming, lrene!

1271
01:39:20,204 --> 01:39:23,456
-Hank!
-lt's OK, lrene.

1272
01:39:25,376 --> 01:39:27,043
Hank's gone.

1273
01:39:27,628 --> 01:39:29,837
-lt's me, Charlie.
-Charlie?

1274
01:39:30,881 --> 01:39:32,840
Maybe you should go back and get help.

1275
01:39:32,925 --> 01:39:35,051
No, l can handle it.

1276
01:39:37,471 --> 01:39:40,223
l'm warning you, pal.
You're gonna get hurt.

1277
01:39:41,475 --> 01:39:43,601
Be careful, Charlie!

1278
01:39:44,186 --> 01:39:47,939
-Just do what he says, Charlie!
-Back off! Just turn around ! Now!

1279
01:39:48,023 --> 01:39:50,400
Take it easy, Dickie. Take it easy.

1280
01:39:52,069 --> 01:39:53,945
There's nowhere to go.

1281
01:39:54,530 --> 01:39:56,447
Come on, Dickie.

1282
01:39:56,824 --> 01:39:58,866
Give me the gun. Come on.

1283
01:40:01,245 --> 01:40:03,329
Come on. That's it.

1284
01:40:04,915 --> 01:40:06,457
Nice and easy.

1285
01:40:17,344 --> 01:40:18,845
Where's my thumb?

1286
01:40:18,929 --> 01:40:21,305
That's kidnapping and assault!

1287
01:40:21,598 --> 01:40:23,558
-Why stop there?
-No!

1288
01:40:24,601 --> 01:40:25,935
Oh, God !

1289
01:40:28,105 --> 01:40:29,605
Whitey!

1290
01:40:29,773 --> 01:40:31,482
Rock 'n' roll !

1291
01:40:38,824 --> 01:40:40,074
lrene!

1292
01:41:15,736 --> 01:41:18,529
-lrene!
-What?

1293
01:41:18,906 --> 01:41:20,656
Oh, my God !

1294
01:41:30,167 --> 01:41:32,835
Keep goin' . Bring it down.

1295
01:41:33,796 --> 01:41:35,922
We're comin' , Daddy! We're comin' , man !

1296
01:41:36,048 --> 01:41:38,049
lt's my kids!

1297
01:41:42,679 --> 01:41:46,182
Hang on, Daddy!
Grab a hold of that motherfucker, man !

1298
01:42:09,248 --> 01:42:11,666
So, how's my thumb lookin' , Doc?

1299
01:42:12,084 --> 01:42:14,418
l'll let you know when l find it.

1300
01:42:14,753 --> 01:42:20,550
lrene, Charlie,
this is Agent Steve Parfitt, FBl.

1301
01:42:20,634 --> 01:42:22,718
You must be real proud of these maniacs.

1302
01:42:23,804 --> 01:42:24,971
Oh, l am.

1303
01:42:27,349 --> 01:42:29,809
Yeah, we're proud
of this motherfucker too.

1304
01:42:31,353 --> 01:42:33,855
lt's good to see you're safe, Dad.

1305
01:42:33,939 --> 01:42:35,273
The colonel informed them

1306
01:42:35,357 --> 01:42:38,192
that all the guilty parties had been
apprehended.

1307
01:42:38,277 --> 01:42:40,778
Gerke was arraigned
at a Providence hospital,

1308
01:42:41,071 --> 01:42:45,241
and Agent Boshane had been arrested
at the train station in New London.

1309
01:42:45,659 --> 01:42:49,162
But Charlie Baileygates
had other things on his mind.

1310
01:42:49,663 --> 01:42:52,331
-Charlie, nicely done.
-Thanks, Sea Bass.

1311
01:42:53,876 --> 01:42:56,669
Hey, Whitey. Listen, l wanted to tell you

1312
01:42:56,753 --> 01:42:58,671
that l really appreciate
everything you did for me.

1313
01:42:58,755 --> 01:43:00,256
l owe you a huge one.

1314
01:43:02,634 --> 01:43:05,469
And l'm truly sorry
that you had to kill again.

1315
01:43:05,554 --> 01:43:09,849
-Must be messing with your head.
-l never killed anyone before.

1316
01:43:09,933 --> 01:43:13,311
-What?
-You're a schizo who's wanted for murder,

1317
01:43:13,395 --> 01:43:14,520
and you're laying in bed next to me

1318
01:43:14,605 --> 01:43:17,565
gabbing like a 1 6-year-old girl
on the phone.

1319
01:43:17,774 --> 01:43:19,734
You freaked me out, man.

1320
01:43:20,110 --> 01:43:23,279
But what about your family?
How did they die?

1321
01:43:23,947 --> 01:43:25,531
l never said they were dead.

1322
01:43:26,408 --> 01:43:27,867
l said they were gone.

1323
01:43:28,452 --> 01:43:30,786
They moved to Phoenix, the bastards.

1324
01:43:30,996 --> 01:43:33,664
Look at me.
l wouldn't last two minutes in the desert.

1325
01:43:35,083 --> 01:43:37,126
Hey, your bandage is wet.

1326
01:43:37,628 --> 01:43:40,213
Oh, yeah?
Well, maybe it's time to come off.

1327
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:43,966
l'm surprised it's held on this long.

1328
01:43:44,593 --> 01:43:46,469
Hey, that's not so bad.

1329
01:43:47,512 --> 01:43:49,805
Hey, Daddy, we just wanted to say that. . .

1330
01:43:50,474 --> 01:43:52,099
Holy shit!

1331
01:43:52,476 --> 01:43:54,685
Look, Daddy got a butthole on his face.

1332
01:43:55,479 --> 01:43:58,022
Oh, boy. Here we go.

1333
01:43:58,774 --> 01:44:01,734
He sure is
a Spartacus-lookin' motherfucker.

1334
01:44:01,818 --> 01:44:06,197
Hey, Daddy, now you can blow your nose
and wipe your ass at the same damn time!

1335
01:44:13,372 --> 01:44:15,414
You know what l'm saying?

1336
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:25,383
-So. . .
-So. . .

1337
01:44:26,677 --> 01:44:31,264
-How'd your meeting with the shrink go?
-Wonderful.

1338
01:44:31,348 --> 01:44:33,557
Clean bill of health.
A well-rounded individual.

1339
01:44:34,601 --> 01:44:38,271
That's great, Charlie.
l'm really happy for you.

1340
01:44:38,355 --> 01:44:39,689
Thank you.

1341
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:41,857
Well. . .

1342
01:44:42,693 --> 01:44:44,277
l hope if you're ever,

1343
01:44:44,820 --> 01:44:47,029
you know, around here, you'll. . .

1344
01:44:49,825 --> 01:44:51,450
Come and visit us.

1345
01:44:52,202 --> 01:44:53,369
Yeah.

1346
01:44:54,079 --> 01:44:57,498
-Little Rhodie.
-Biggest little state in the union.

1347
01:45:07,050 --> 01:45:09,802
-Let me get that for you.
-Thanks.

1348
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:15,224
-Hey, lrene?
-Yeah?

1349
01:45:17,394 --> 01:45:20,271
Maybe l could come
visit you sometime soon.

1350
01:45:22,065 --> 01:45:23,357
Promise?

1351
01:45:25,652 --> 01:45:27,028
You bet.

1352
01:45:30,115 --> 01:45:33,909
And that's the word
of a Rhode lsland State Trooper, ma'am.

1353
01:46:00,354 --> 01:46:05,983
l found you sittin' on a suitcase cryin'

1354
01:46:07,611 --> 01:46:14,367
Beneath my feet
l feel the rumble of a subway train, yeah

1355
01:46:15,619 --> 01:46:22,166
l laugh out loud 'cause it's the one thing
l hadn't been tryin'

1356
01:46:23,794 --> 01:46:25,544
The train came in breathless

1357
01:46:25,629 --> 01:46:27,171
The passengers restless

1358
01:46:27,255 --> 01:46:30,716
She said "Baby, you'll never change"

1359
01:46:30,801 --> 01:46:32,718
You gotta get goin'

1360
01:46:32,803 --> 01:46:34,678
You gotta keep goin'

1361
01:46:35,305 --> 01:46:38,641
Hey, the world ain't slowin' down. . .

1362
01:46:39,476 --> 01:46:41,268
You gotta be kidding.

1363
01:46:44,606 --> 01:46:46,399
Hold it right there.

1364
01:46:52,447 --> 01:46:55,199
Miss Waters?
l'd like you to step out of the car.

1365
01:46:55,325 --> 01:46:57,201
What did l not do now?

1366
01:46:57,369 --> 01:47:00,371
-We've reason to believe this is stolen.
-What?

1367
01:47:00,497 --> 01:47:03,791
No, no, l rented this car!

1368
01:47:04,084 --> 01:47:06,710
Would you step out of the car, please?

1369
01:47:08,505 --> 01:47:09,672
Great.

1370
01:47:11,967 --> 01:47:15,010
Front of the car, please.
Hands on the hood.

1371
01:47:15,679 --> 01:47:16,971
Spread your legs.

1372
01:47:17,222 --> 01:47:20,224
-That's great.
-Thank you. Following procedure, ma'am.

1373
01:47:22,269 --> 01:47:24,270
Oh, you guys!

1374
01:47:24,521 --> 01:47:28,941
You guys are beautiful ! Look,
why don't we skip the trial, get right to it?

1375
01:47:29,025 --> 01:47:31,485
You can lock me up
and keep me here forever!

1376
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:35,364
That's what l had planned.

1377
01:47:36,867 --> 01:47:38,117
Look.

1378
01:47:39,411 --> 01:47:43,998
-l hope her little skinny ass is reading this.
-Man, l'm pretty sure she's lookin' , man.

1379
01:47:49,713 --> 01:47:51,505
Oh, Charlie.

1380
01:48:13,236 --> 01:48:15,654
lt's gonna be raining wine
and roses tonight.

1381
01:48:15,739 --> 01:48:18,532
lt'll be rainin' my motherfuckin' cookies

1382
01:48:18,617 --> 01:48:22,161
if this motherfucker don't stop
this turbulence shit!

1383
01:48:22,245 --> 01:48:25,664
Well, that's Charlie's story,
and l'm sticking to it.

1384
01:48:25,916 --> 01:48:29,752
They all moved in together
and lived as one big happy family.

1385
01:48:30,212 --> 01:48:34,924
Charlie and lrene, the guys,
even that nice albino fella, Whitey.

1386
01:48:35,592 --> 01:48:39,136
And l'm happy to report
Charlie got promoted to lieutenant

1387
01:48:39,429 --> 01:48:45,643
in the greatest law enforcement agency
in the land: the Rhode lsland State Police.

1388
01:48:45,894 --> 01:48:49,313
Yeah, it was a regular slice of Americana.

1389
01:48:49,481 --> 01:48:53,317
Y'all come back now! Thanks
for watching our motherfuckin' movie!

1390
01:48:56,947 --> 01:48:59,114
You gotta keep goin'

1391
01:48:59,366 --> 01:49:02,618
Hey, the world ain't slowin' down

1392
01:49:02,953 --> 01:49:04,370
For no one

1393
01:49:04,454 --> 01:49:07,790
lt's a carnival callin' out to you

1394
01:49:07,874 --> 01:49:11,043
lt's callin' out to you

1395
01:49:11,127 --> 01:49:12,711
lt sounds like a song

1396
01:49:13,129 --> 01:49:14,838
lt hits you like Scripture

1397
01:49:15,131 --> 01:49:20,052
You paint the picture
with colors squeezed from your hand

1398
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:28,310
Weren't you the kid
who just climbed on the merry-go. . .

1399
01:49:28,395 --> 01:49:32,982
Weren't you the kid
who just climbed on the merry-go-round?

1400
01:49:33,316 --> 01:49:37,820
Hey, look, the world ain't slowin' down

1401
01:49:39,781 --> 01:49:41,740
Hey, hey

1402
01:49:42,367 --> 01:49:46,287
The world ain't slowin' down

1403
01:49:47,789 --> 01:49:49,331
Hey, hey

1404
01:49:50,875 --> 01:49:58,257
lt's a big blue world

1405
01:49:58,341 --> 01:50:05,306
We're ridin' on a big blue world

1406
01:50:49,225 --> 01:50:52,770
ln the mornin' you go gunnin'

1407
01:50:53,063 --> 01:50:56,649
For the man who stole your water

1408
01:50:56,775 --> 01:51:00,486
Then you fire till he's done in

1409
01:51:00,779 --> 01:51:04,365
But they catch you at the border

1410
01:51:04,741 --> 01:51:08,285
And the mourners are all singin'

1411
01:51:08,578 --> 01:51:12,289
As they drag you by your feet

1412
01:51:12,415 --> 01:51:15,876
But the hangman isn't hangin'

1413
01:51:16,294 --> 01:51:19,963
And they put you on the street

1414
01:51:20,382 --> 01:51:22,800
You go back, Jack

1415
01:51:22,884 --> 01:51:24,760
Do it again

1416
01:51:25,261 --> 01:51:28,013
Wheels turnin' round and round

1417
01:51:28,098 --> 01:51:30,432
You go back, Jack

1418
01:51:30,725 --> 01:51:34,353
Do it again

1419
01:51:40,694 --> 01:51:42,403
When you know you're no high climber

1420
01:51:42,487 --> 01:51:44,113
And you find out your only friend

1421
01:51:44,698 --> 01:51:46,031
ln a room with a two-timer

1422
01:51:46,533 --> 01:51:47,991
And you're sure you're near the end

1423
01:51:48,410 --> 01:51:49,868
Then you love a little wild one

1424
01:51:50,078 --> 01:51:51,870
You bring to her a smile
and then l saw one

1425
01:51:52,247 --> 01:51:53,747
All the time that you know you're smilin'

1426
01:51:54,958 --> 01:51:58,460
Your black cards can make you money

1427
01:51:58,670 --> 01:52:02,381
So you hide them when you're able

1428
01:52:02,632 --> 01:52:06,218
ln the land of milk and honey

1429
01:52:06,469 --> 01:52:10,347
You must put them on the table

1430
01:52:10,640 --> 01:52:13,100
You go back, Jack

1431
01:52:13,184 --> 01:52:14,977
Do it again

1432
01:52:15,562 --> 01:52:18,230
Wheels turnin' round and round

1433
01:52:18,314 --> 01:52:20,774
You go back, Jack

1434
01:52:20,942 --> 01:52:24,862
Do it again

1435
01:53:20,752 --> 01:53:22,920
Hope unknown

1436
01:53:23,171 --> 01:53:25,589
Sometimes just waking is surreal

1437
01:53:25,757 --> 01:53:28,467
l walk right through the nameless ones

1438
01:53:28,885 --> 01:53:31,887
l know that hope's unknown

1439
01:53:32,347 --> 01:53:34,515
Sometimes the water feels so real

1440
01:53:34,891 --> 01:53:37,142
As l walk through, it fills my lungs

1441
01:53:37,227 --> 01:53:39,102
My God, l'm drowning

1442
01:53:39,187 --> 01:53:43,607
This day never seems to end
this pain never

1443
01:53:43,691 --> 01:53:45,609
This day never seems to

1444
01:53:45,860 --> 01:53:48,946
This rage l cannot let go

1445
01:53:49,030 --> 01:53:51,198
l hear them calling

1446
01:53:51,282 --> 01:53:53,492
l feel them gnawing

1447
01:53:54,828 --> 01:53:57,871
Holes through flawless souls

1448
01:53:57,956 --> 01:53:59,998
l hear them calling

1449
01:54:00,083 --> 01:54:02,251
l feel them gnawing

1450
01:54:03,711 --> 01:54:07,214
Holes through flawless souls

1451
01:54:15,014 --> 01:54:17,266
So alone

1452
01:54:17,809 --> 01:54:19,643
Sometimes l swear that l can hear

1453
01:54:20,103 --> 01:54:22,855
The taunting of the voiceless ones

1454
01:54:23,231 --> 01:54:26,024
l fear that l alone

1455
01:54:26,693 --> 01:54:28,986
Fear those who finally ceased to feel

1456
01:54:29,237 --> 01:54:31,530
That they're alone inside this place

1457
01:54:31,614 --> 01:54:33,699
l am the misplaced

1458
01:54:33,783 --> 01:54:37,786
This day never seems to end
this pain never

1459
01:54:37,954 --> 01:54:40,122
This day never seems to

1460
01:54:40,206 --> 01:54:43,375
This rage l cannot let go

1461
01:54:43,459 --> 01:54:45,544
l hear them calling

1462
01:54:45,628 --> 01:54:48,213
l feel them gnawing

1463
01:54:49,299 --> 01:54:51,884
Holes through flawless souls

1464
01:54:52,468 --> 01:54:54,636
l hear them calling

1465
01:54:54,804 --> 01:54:56,597
l feel them gnawing

1466
01:54:58,308 --> 01:55:02,060
Holes through flawless souls

1467
01:55:04,522 --> 01:55:06,148
Now every face looks familiar

1468
01:55:06,232 --> 01:55:08,233
Then every face melts away till now

1469
01:55:08,401 --> 01:55:11,486
Everyone, do you know
l know your deception?

1470
01:55:11,571 --> 01:55:13,322
Now every face looks familiar

1471
01:55:13,489 --> 01:55:15,741
Then every face melts away till now

1472
01:55:15,825 --> 01:55:19,828
Everyone, do you know
l know your deception?

1473
01:55:23,374 --> 01:55:25,626
l hear them calling

1474
01:55:25,710 --> 01:55:27,794
l feel them gnawing

1475
01:55:29,172 --> 01:55:32,132
Holes through flawless souls

1476
01:55:32,216 --> 01:55:34,259
l hear them calling

1477
01:55:34,594 --> 01:55:37,846
l feel them gnawing

1478
01:55:38,181 --> 01:55:41,224
Holes through flawless souls

1479
01:55:41,392 --> 01:55:43,518
l hear them calling

1480
01:55:43,603 --> 01:55:46,855
l feel them gnawing

1481
01:55:47,190 --> 01:55:52,861
Holes through flawless souls

1482
01:55:55,365 --> 01:55:58,867
OK, everybody,
the water temperature is 63º .

1483
01:55:59,035 --> 01:56:02,204
Pop's thumb should be OK
if we find it within the next six hours.

1484
01:56:02,288 --> 01:56:04,623
-Sure?
-Do the math, motherfucker.

1485
01:56:04,707 --> 01:56:06,792
-Damn !
-Jeez.

1486
01:56:15,885 --> 01:56:18,512
-Fellas, l think l found it!
-What?

1487
01:56:25,061 --> 01:56:27,646
-False alarm.
-Oh, damn, Whitey!
