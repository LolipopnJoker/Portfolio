She looks at me every day.
Mary Jane Watson.

3
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,606
Oh, boy. If she only knew
how I felt about her.

4
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:11,566
But she can never know.

5
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:15,194
I made a choice once to live
a life of responsibility.

6
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,656
A life she can never be a part of.

7
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:19,116
Who am I?

8
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,868
I'm Spider-Man, given a job to do.

9
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,038
And I'm Peter Parker,
and I, too, have a job.

10
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:26,790
Parker. Parker!

11
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:29,208
No, no, no, stop! Stop!

12
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:33,296
Parker, you're late, man. Always late.

13
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:36,341
I'm sorry, Mr. Aziz.
There was a disturbance.

14
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:38,844
Another disturbance.
Always a disturbance with you.

15
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,805
Come on, 21 minutes ago,
in comes order.

16
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:45,559
Harmattan, Burton &amp; Smith.
Eight extra-large deep-dish pizzas.

17
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:48,603
In eight minutes, I am defaulting on
Joe's 29-minute guarantee.

18
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,732
Then, not only am I receiving
no money for these pizzas...

19
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,568
...but I will lose the customer forever
to Pizza Yurt.

20
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:58,113
Look, you are my only hope, all right?
You have to make it in time.

21
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,033
Peter, you're a nice guy.
But you're just not dependable.

22
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,244
This is your last chance.

23
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:09,166
You have to go 42 blocks
in 7 1/2 minutes or your ass is fired.

24
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,753
Go!

25
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:36,610
Hey, what, are you stupid?

26
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,718
Whoa! He stole that guy's pizzas!

27
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,020
I'm gonna get it!

28
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,996
Hey, you guys.
No playing in the streets.

29
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,414
Yes, Mr. Spider-Man.

30
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,375
See you.

31
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:35,836
Way to go, Spidey!

32
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,599
Pizza time.

33
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,938
You're late.

34
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,232
I'm not paying for those.

35
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:01,171
Joe's 29-minute guarantee
is a promise, man.

36
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:05,967
I know to you, Parker, a promise
means nothing. But to me, it's serious.

37
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,136
It's serious to me too, Mr. Aziz.

38
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:10,764
-You're fired. Go.
-Please, I need this job.

39
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:13,558
-You're fired.
-Look, give me another chance.

40
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:23,985
You're fired.

41
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:26,404
-Parker, hello. You're fired.
-Why?

42
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,031
Dogs catching Frisbees?

43
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,575
Pigeons in the park?
A couple geezers playing chess?

44
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:31,910
-Boss.
-Not now.

45
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,788
The Bugle could show another side
of New York for a change.

46
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,916
We got six minutes to deadline, Jonah.
We need page one.

47
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:41,378
I don't pay you to be a sensitive artiste.
I pay you-- Still not now!

48
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,255
I pay you because that psycho
Spider-Man will pose for you.

49
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,216
He won't let me take
any more pictures.

50
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,093
You turned the whole city
against him.

51
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,594
A fact I'm very proud of.

52
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:53,515
Get your pretty little portfolio off my
desk before I go into a diabetic coma.

53
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:57,060
-It's your wife, she lost her checkbook.
-Thanks for the good news.

54
00:07:57,227 --> 00:08:00,563
Please, isn't there any of these shots
you can use? I need the money.

55
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,775
Miss Brant. Get me a violin.

56
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,652
Five minutes to deadline, Jonah.

57
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,488
Run a picture of a rancid chicken.
Here's the headline:

58
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,490
"Food Poisoning Scare Sweeps City."

59
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:13,034
-Some food got poisoned?
-I'm a little nauseous.

60
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,078
All right, Mr. Jameson.

61
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:18,957
It stinks.
Robbie, there's your page one.

62
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:20,750
"Masked Menace Terrorizes Town."

63
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,377
I told you, he's not a menace.

64
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,295
-I told you--
-I'll take care of it.

65
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,047
-I'll give you 150.
-Three hundred.

66
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,716
That's outrageous.

67
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,843
Done. Give this to the girl.

68
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,302
Thank you. Bye-bye.

69
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,179
Hi.

70
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,848
Hey, Pete.

71
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:41,688
I don't think this covers the advance
I gave you a couple weeks ago.

72
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,024
-Right.
-Sorry.

73
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,443
Hey.

74
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,528
Chin up, okay?

75
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,084
Watch it, jerk!

76
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,638
Dr. Connors. Sorry.

77
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,390
Where were you headed, Parker?

78
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,892
To your class.

79
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,894
My class is over.

80
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,229
See me standing here?

81
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:27,233
I'm sorry. I'm trying.
I wanna be here.

82
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,735
Then be here.

83
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,571
Look at you, Peter.

84
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:36,409
Your grades have been steadily
declining. You're late for class.

85
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,496
You always appear exhausted.

86
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,999
Your paper on fusion is still overdue.

87
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:46,294
I know. I'm planning to write it
on Dr. Otto Octavius.

88
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:49,631
Planning is not a major
at this university.

89
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,969
Octavius is a friend of mine.

90
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,305
Better do your research, Parker.

91
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:00,809
Get it done, or I'm failing you.

92
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,374
Surprise!

93
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,459
Well, say something.

94
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,919
What's the occasion?

95
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,630
Really, Peter. It's your birthday!

96
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,967
Whether you want
to remember it or not.

97
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:37,637
He lives in another reality.
Don't you, Pete?

98
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,764
-Hi, M.J.
-Hi.

99
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:41,641
-Hey, buddy.
-Hey.

100
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,017
Long time, no see.

101
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:47,063
So how's the play?
I read a great review.

102
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,940
It's going fine. It's going good.

103
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,358
She's brilliant in it.

104
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,193
Harry sent me roses.

105
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,946
So where you been, pal?
You don't return my calls.

106
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:58,283
I've been busy.

107
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:01,995
Taking pictures of Spider-Man?
How's the bug these days?

108
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,164
The less you see of that man,
the better.

109
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,750
Now, let's all go into the other room
and have something to eat.

110
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,210
I'll get the hors d'oeuvres.

111
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,504
So how are things going at Oscorp?

112
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,549
They're great.
I'm head of Special Projects.

113
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:16,843
We're about to make
a breakthrough on fusion.

114
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:21,222
How lovely, Harry. Your father
would be so proud, rest his soul.

115
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,681
Thank you.

116
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:26,811
We're actually funding
one of your idols, Pete. Otto Octavius.

117
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:29,480
-I'm writing a paper on him.
-You want to meet him?

118
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:30,899
You'd introduce me?

119
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:34,277
You bet. Octavius is
gonna put Oscorp on the map...

120
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,487
...in a way my father
never even dreamed of.

121
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,573
M.J., could you give me a hand?

122
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,535
She's waiting for you, pal.

123
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,495
What do you mean?

124
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:47,123
The way she looks at you
or doesn't look at you.

125
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:49,042
However you want to look at it.

126
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,544
I don't have time for girls right now.

127
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,046
Why, are you dead?

128
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,713
I've been kind of busy.

129
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,591
Taking pictures of your friend?

130
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,594
Could we get off that subject?

131
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:03,097
I want us to be friends, Harry.
I want us to trust each other.

132
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,891
Then be honest with me.

133
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,769
If you knew who he was,
would you tell me?

134
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,919
May.

135
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,629
Oh, what, Ben?

136
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:37,924
Wait.

137
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,550
-Aunt May.
-Oh, my.

138
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:45,181
Oh, Peter. Oh, for a second there,
I thought I was years ago.

139
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,310
Everybody's gone, aren't they?

140
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:51,437
Did they have a good time?

141
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,189
I'm sure they did.

142
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:58,861
-You okay?
-Of course. But you go home.

143
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:04,617
And be careful. I don't like that
scooter thing you drive around.

144
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:06,536
I'm worried about you.

145
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:11,874
You're so alone.
And I saw the letter from the bank.

146
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,627
Oh, my. You did?

147
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,462
Oh, well.

148
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,047
So?

149
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,258
I'm a little behind.

150
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,969
Everybody is.

151
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:26,639
Anyway, I don't want
to talk about it anymore.

152
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:30,560
I'm tired,
and you better start back home.

153
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,813
Here, kiddo. Happy birthday.

154
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,815
You need it more than I do.

155
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,527
-No, I can't take that from you.
-Yes, you can!

156
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:41,738
You can take this money from me.

157
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,657
For God's sake, it's not much.
Now, take it!

158
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:47,327
And don't you dare leave it here.

159
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,412
Oh, I'm sorry.

160
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:54,167
It's just that I miss
your uncle Ben so much.

161
00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:01,174
Can you believe that it's two years
next month since he was taken?

162
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,678
I think to myself at times...

163
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:11,184
...were I to face the one responsible
for what happened, I'd....

164
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,228
Oh, I don't know what I'd do.

165
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,362
Now...

166
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,033
...you better take
the rest of your cake home.

167
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,257
Hey.

168
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,593
Hey. You're still here.

169
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,346
I saw your billboard on Bleecker.

170
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,808
Isn't it funny?
I'm really kind of embarrassed.

171
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:56,062
Don't be. It's nice.
I get to see you every day now.

172
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:01,109
I liked seeing you tonight, Peter.

173
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,113
Oh, boy, yeah.

174
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,699
"Oh, boy, yeah" what?

175
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:14,872
Nothing.

176
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:21,087
Do you want to say something?

177
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,678
I...

178
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,893
...was...

179
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:40,148
...wondering if you're still
in the Village.

180
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,325
You're such a mystery.

181
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,379
Peter.

182
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,299
What?

183
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,014
Happy birthday.

184
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,858
I'm seeing somebody now.

185
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,861
You mean, like a boyfriend?

186
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:29,697
Well, like I like him.

187
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,243
What?

188
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,662
Nothing.

189
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,750
That's good, you know?
Companionship....

190
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,128
May be more than that.

191
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:46,797
More?

192
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:48,966
I don't know.

193
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,512
I'm coming to see your play
tomorrow night.

194
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:58,518
-You're coming?
-I'll be there.

195
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,187
Don't disappoint me.

196
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,315
I won't.

197
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,039
Rent.

198
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,546
-Hi.
-Hi. What's "hi"?

199
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,214
Can I spend it?

200
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:30,883
I have a paycheck due this week
and--

201
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,387
-You're a month late again. Again.
-I promise as soon as--

202
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:38,057
If promises were crackers,
my daughter would be fat.

203
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:43,145
I'm really sorry, Mr. Ditkovitch. All
I got is this 20 for the rest of the week.

204
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,356
"Sorry" doesn't pay the rent.

205
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:50,403
And don't try to sneak past me. I have
ears like a cat and eyes like a rodent.

206
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,949
-Thanks, Mr. Ditkovitch.
-Hi, Pete.

207
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,372
Hello?

208
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,465
Rent?

209
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,930
Doctor? Mr. Osborn's here.

210
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:03,976
Nobel Prize, Otto. Nobel Prize.
And we'll all be rich.

211
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,936
It's not about the prizes, Harry.

212
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,897
But you need money.
You need Oscorp.

213
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:09,148
Who do we have here?

214
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,233
This is my good friend
I called you about.

215
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,110
He got me through
high-school science.

216
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:16,197
Peter Parker, sir.
I'm writing a paper on you for--

217
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:17,865
I know what you're doing here...

218
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:20,326
...but I don't have time
to talk to students now.

219
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,120
But Oscorp pays the bills, so....

220
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,623
That's why I have to take off.
Board meeting.

221
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:29,168
But my job is done here.
Got you two geniuses together.

222
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:33,923
Good luck tomorrow, Otto.
Nobel Prize. We'll see you in Sweden!

223
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,135
Interesting fellow, your friend.

224
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,429
I won't take much of your time.

225
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:44,975
Now I remember you. You're Connors'
student. He tells me you're brilliant.

226
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,853
He also tells me you're lazy.

227
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,106
I'm trying to do better.

228
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:53,859
Being brilliant's not enough,
young man. You have to work hard.

229
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,363
Intelligence is not a privilege,
it's a gift.

230
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,699
And you use it
for the good of mankind.

231
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,325
You want to try it back there?

232
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,703
So is that it?

233
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:08,290
Yes. My design to initiate
and sustain fusion.

234
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,585
I understand you use harmonics
of atomic frequencies.

235
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,129
Sympathetic frequencies.

236
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,339
Harmonic reinforcement?

237
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,383
Go on.

238
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:21,512
An exponential increase
in energy output.

239
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,347
A huge amount of energy.

240
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:27,685
Like a perpetual sun providing
renewable power for the whole world.

241
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:31,063
Are you sure you could stabilize
the fusion reaction?

242
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,567
Peter, what have we been talking
about for the last hour and a half?

243
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,069
This is my life's work.

244
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:40,573
I certainly know the consequences
of the slightest miscalculation.

245
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,033
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to question you.

246
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,579
Rosie, our new friend thinks
I'm gonna blow up the city.

247
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,581
You can sleep soundly tonight.

248
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,458
Otto's done his homework.

249
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:53,753
Come to the demonstration tomorrow,
and you'll see for yourself.

250
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,422
And you need
to sleep soundly tonight, Otto.

251
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,758
Did Edison sleep
before he turned on the light?

252
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,552
Did Marconi sleep
before he turned on the radio?

253
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,846
Did Beethoven sleep
before he wrote the 5th?

254
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:07,308
Did Bernoulli sleep before he found
the curves of quickest descent?

255
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,977
Rosie, I love this boy.

256
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:13,939
Peter, tell us about yourself.
Do you have a girlfriend?

257
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,567
Well....

258
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,069
I don't really know.

259
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:22,323
Well, shouldn't you know?
I mean, who would know?

260
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:25,534
Leave him alone.
Maybe it's a secret love.

261
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,620
Love should never be a secret.

262
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:31,040
If you keep something as complicated
as love stored up inside...

263
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,417
...gonna make you sick.

264
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,836
I finally got lucky in love.

265
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,338
We both did.

266
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:41,217
But it's hardly perfect.
You have to work at it.

267
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:45,095
I met him on the college steps,
and I knew it wasn't going to be easy.

268
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:48,516
He was studying science,
and I was studying English literature.

269
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,852
That's right. I was trying to explain
the theory of relativity.

270
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,522
And Rosie was trying
to explain T.S. Eliot.

271
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,775
I still don't understand
what he was talking about.

272
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,151
-Yes, you do.
-I'm serious.

273
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,863
T.S. Eliot is more complicated
than advanced science.

274
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:07,368
But if you want to get a woman to fall
in love with you, feed her poetry.

275
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,036
Poetry.

276
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:11,705
Never fails.

277
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:19,213
A tall and slender maiden
All alone upon a prairie

278
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,757
Brightest green were all her garments

279
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:24,301
And her hair was like the sunshine

280
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:27,345
Day by day he gazed upon her

281
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,238
Rent!

282
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,825
Where is my money?!

283
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:57,770
You seem jittery tonight.

284
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,730
You never know who's coming.

285
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:18,040
Ladies, five minutes. Five minutes.

286
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:36,558
How'd you do that?

287
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,855
Work out, plenty of rest.

288
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:43,983
You know, eat your green vegetables.

289
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:48,404
That's what my mom is always saying.
I just never actually believed her.

290
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,574
Come on. Go.

291
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:56,912
Keep it steady.

292
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:20,936
It's a web.

293
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,689
Go, Spidey, go!

294
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,032
We got trouble!

295
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,635
Get me down!

296
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:57,181
I am more than content
with what Mr. Moncrieff said.

297
00:25:57,347 --> 00:26:00,642
His voice alone inspires one
with absolute credulity.

298
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,936
Then you think we should
forgive them?

299
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,483
Yes.

300
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,485
I mean, no.

301
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:18,077
Hey. Hey. Hey, chief.
You park there, I'm towing it.

302
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:20,079
Whatever.

303
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,249
Shoelace.

304
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,422
You might want to....

305
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:39,932
-Can I help you?
-Yeah, I've come to see the show.

306
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:43,936
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. No one will be
seated after the doors are closed.

307
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,439
It helps maintain the illusion.

308
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:52,236
Miss Watson, she's a friend of mine.
She asked me to come.

309
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:53,904
But not to come late.

310
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:59,785
I have to see this show.
Just let me in, I'll stand in the--

311
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,633
A Spider-Man
A Spider-Man

312
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:18,804
A-does whatever a spider can

313
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:21,974
A-spins a web, any size

314
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:24,518
Catches thieves a-just like flies

315
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:27,938
Look out
Here comes the Spider-Man

316
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:46,331
You sure you don't wanna
come tonight?

317
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,875
Yeah, I'm sure.

318
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,960
-Okay. Call me.
-I will.

319
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:51,837
-You were great tonight.
-Thanks.

320
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,925
May I have an autograph,
please, miss?

321
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:59,553
What are you doing here?

322
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:15,903
You hungry?

323
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,321
Starved.

324
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,873
What was that?

325
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:16,088
Okay.

326
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,212
Cool Spidey outfit.

327
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,299
Thanks.

328
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:03,552
Where'd you get it?

329
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,221
I made it.

330
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,810
Looks uncomfortable.

331
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:15,314
Yeah, it gets kind of itchy.

332
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,570
And it rides up in the crotch
a little bit too.

333
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:15,707
Hi. It's me.
Sing your song at the beep.

334
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,793
Hi, M.J.

335
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,252
This is Peter.

336
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:22,881
I was on my way to your show and....

337
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:27,594
Well, I was on my bike....

338
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,140
Are you there?

339
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:37,646
I really was planning on it all day.

340
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,482
And...

341
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,236
...I know you predicted
I'd disappoint you.

342
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,196
Bingo.

343
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:48,907
It's amazing, isn't it?

344
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:52,661
How complicated a simple thing...

345
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:57,958
...like being someplace at 8:00
can become.

346
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:05,715
Actually, there was
this obnoxious usher.

347
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:09,511
Somebody has to talk
to that usher, M.J.

348
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:11,221
Your time has expired.

349
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:15,600
Please deposit 50 cents
for the next five minutes.

350
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,446
I wanna tell you the truth.

351
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:30,991
Here it is.

352
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,660
I'm Spider-Man.

353
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:36,204
Weird, huh?

354
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,375
Now you know
why I can't be with you.

355
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:46,173
If my enemies found out about you...

356
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:52,262
...if you got hurt,
I could never forgive myself.

357
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:01,146
I wish I could tell you
how I feel about you.

358
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:13,909
Ladies and gentlemen...

359
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:17,913
...my wife Rosie and I would like to
welcome you this afternoon.

360
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,748
But first, before we start...

361
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:24,294
...has anybody lost a large roll
of 20-dollar bills in a rubber band?

362
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,213
Because we found the rubber band.

363
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:32,344
It's a terrible joke.

364
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,221
But thank you for coming.

365
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,805
Today...

366
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:40,519
...you will witness the birth
of a new fusion-based energy source.

367
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:46,024
Safe, renewable energy
and cheap electricity for everyone.

368
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:50,612
And now let me introduce
my assistants.

369
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:01,206
These four actuators were
developed and programmed...

370
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:04,876
...for the sole purpose of creating
successful fusion.

371
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,546
They are impervious to heat
and magnetism.

372
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:57,012
These smart arms are controlled
by my brain through a neural link.

373
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:00,473
Nanowires feed directly
into my cerebellum...

374
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,769
...allowing me to use these arms
to control fusion reaction...

375
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,772
...in an environment
no human hand could enter.

376
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,358
Doctor, if the artificial intelligence
in the arms...

377
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,319
...is as advanced as you suggest...

378
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,529
...couldn't that make you
vulnerable to them?

379
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:15,864
How right you are.

380
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:18,199
Which is why I developed
this inhibitor chip...

381
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,744
...to protect
my higher brain function.

382
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:25,373
It means I maintain control of these
arms, instead of them controlling me.

383
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:28,001
And now on to the main event.

384
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:30,086
Give me the blue light, Rosie.

385
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:53,526
Precious tritium is the fuel
that makes this project go.

386
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:56,821
There's only 25 pounds of it
on the whole planet.

387
00:35:57,489 --> 00:36:01,660
I'd like to thank Harry Osborn
and Oscorp Industries for providing it.

388
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,745
Happy to pay the bills, Otto.

389
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,094
Ladies and gentlemen...

390
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,515
...fasten your seat belts.

391
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,869
Doctor, we have
a successful fusion reaction.

392
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:52,961
This is a breakthrough
beyond your father's dreams.

393
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:54,254
Thank you.

394
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:56,423
We're producing
a thousand-megawatt surplus.

395
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:05,974
The power of the sun...

396
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,727
...in the palm of my hand.

397
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,917
Keep calm! It's only a spike!

398
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,919
It'll soon stabilize!

399
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:43,428
Ladies and gentlemen,
please clear the room.

400
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,602
We have a containment breach!

401
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,440
Otto, please get back!

402
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:59,235
Shut it off, Otto! Shut it off!

403
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:02,238
It will stabilize! It's under control!

404
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,282
I'm in charge here!

405
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:07,285
It's my money! I'm in con--

406
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:12,916
This doesn't change anything.

407
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:18,630
-What are you doing?
-Pulling the plug.

408
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,256
No!

409
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:40,777
Rosie!

410
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:12,642
Watch it.

411
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:14,018
That was too close.

412
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:18,273
If he had more than a drop of tritium,
he could have destroyed the city.

413
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,071
I'm ruined.

414
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:29,242
I have nothing left, except Spider-Man.

415
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:31,077
He saved your life, sir.

416
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,913
He humiliated me by touching me.

417
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,708
The press will be here soon.
I suggest we move on.

418
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,751
What was he doing here anyway?

419
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,562
Molten metal penetrated
the spinal cavity...

420
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:59,898
...and fused the vertebrae
at multiple points...

421
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,650
...including the lamina
and the roof of the spinal column.

422
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,986
We won't know the extent of
the damage until we get in there.

423
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:08,239
I suggest we cut off these mechanical
arms, slice up the harness...

424
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,658
...and, if need be,
consider a laminectomy...

425
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:14,078
...with posterior spinal fusion
from C7-T1 to T12.

426
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,663
We're ready, doctor.

427
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,793
Anybody here take shop class?

428
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,880
Help me! Help me!

429
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:20,455
No!

430
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:14,759
It's all over town, Robbie.
Gossip. Rumors.

431
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:17,095
Panic in the streets, if we're lucky.

432
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:20,098
Crazy scientist turns himself
into some kind of a monster.

433
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:23,267
Four mechanical arms welded
right onto his body.

434
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:28,397
Guy named Otto Octavius winds up
with eight limbs. What are the odds?

435
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:29,774
Hoffman!

436
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,277
What are we gonna call this guy?

437
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,696
-"Dr. Octopus."
-That's crap.

438
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:37,448
-"Science Squid"?
-Crap!

439
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:39,700
-"Dr. Strange."
-That's pretty good.

440
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:44,705
But it's taken.
Wait, wait! I got it. "Dr. Octopus."

441
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,166
-I like it.
-Of course you do.

442
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:51,087
Dr. Octopus. New villain in town.
"Doc Ock."

443
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:53,256
-Genius.
-What, are you looking for a raise?

444
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:55,091
Get out.

445
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,968
Chief, I found Parker.

446
00:43:57,135 --> 00:43:59,428
Where you been?
Why don't you pay your phone bill.

447
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:01,931
Mad scientist goes berserk,
we don't have pictures!

448
00:44:02,098 --> 00:44:03,891
I heard Spider-Man was there.

449
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:07,103
Where were you?
Photographing squirrels? You're fired.

450
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:08,604
Chief, the planetarium party.

451
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,481
You're un-fired.
I need you, come here.

452
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,191
What do you know
about high society?

453
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:14,569
-Oh. Well, I--
-Don't answer that.

454
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:18,281
My society photographer got hit in the
head by a polo ball. You're all I got.

455
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:21,409
Big party for an American hero.
My son, the astronaut.

456
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:23,327
Could you pay me in advance?

457
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:34,839
You serious? Pay you for what?
Standing there?

458
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:37,675
The planetarium, tomorrow night, 8:00.
There's the door.

459
00:44:52,732 --> 00:44:54,483
My Rosie's dead.

460
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,404
My dream is dead.

461
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:03,367
And these...

462
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:08,873
...monstrous things should be
at the bottom of the river...

463
00:45:11,708 --> 00:45:13,127
...along with me.

464
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:23,720
Something...

465
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:26,682
...in my head.

466
00:45:30,353 --> 00:45:31,896
Something talking.

467
00:45:35,942 --> 00:45:37,401
The inhibitor chip!

468
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:42,406
Gone.

469
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:48,454
Rebuild.

470
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,542
No.

471
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:56,170
Peter was right.

472
00:45:58,506 --> 00:46:00,091
I miscalculated.

473
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:08,765
I couldn't have miscalculated.

474
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,768
It was working, wasn't it?

475
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:18,109
Yes.

476
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:22,154
We could rebuild.
Enlarge the containment field.

477
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:24,615
Make it bigger
and stronger than ever.

478
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,285
But we need money.

479
00:46:29,078 --> 00:46:30,413
Steal it?

480
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:32,415
No, no, no, I'm not a criminal.

481
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:36,335
That's right.

482
00:46:38,254 --> 00:46:41,465
The real crime would be not to finish
what we started.

483
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:46,762
We'll do it here.

484
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:50,807
The power of the sun
in the palm of my hand.

485
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,602
Nothing will stand in our way.

486
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,104
Nothing!

487
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:03,154
-That's the social security.
-Yes, I see.

488
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:05,156
My uncle Ben's life insurance.

489
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:07,533
Yes, but I'm afraid...

490
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:10,827
...it's just not sufficient
to refinance your home.

491
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:14,623
Oh, but I'm giving
piano lessons again.

492
00:47:14,831 --> 00:47:16,083
You are?

493
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:24,467
We appreciate
that you've just opened up...

494
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:27,219
...a new supersaver account
with us today.

495
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:28,679
But the fact is...

496
00:47:28,845 --> 00:47:33,184
...you do not have the assets
to justify this loan. I'm sorry.

497
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,353
Well....

498
00:47:37,146 --> 00:47:38,981
At least we get the toaster.

499
00:47:39,148 --> 00:47:43,194
Actually, that's only
with a deposit of 300 or more.

500
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,365
Oh, yes, I see.

501
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:50,451
Okay.

502
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:55,623
Don't worry, we'll figure it out.

503
00:48:12,932 --> 00:48:14,266
Peter?

504
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:18,062
Don't leave me.

505
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:21,273
Oh, that boy of yours is a real hero.

506
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:23,025
Hold it!

507
00:48:23,776 --> 00:48:26,445
Put your arms up! All of them!

508
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,053
Here's your change!

509
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:02,606
Oh, no. Come on!

510
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:18,122
-You're getting on my nerves.
-I have a knack for that.

511
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:19,915
Not anymore.

512
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,447
-Freeze! Don't move!
-Freeze!

513
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:57,203
-Hold your fire!
-Don't follow me.

514
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:02,875
Wait a second.

515
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:22,895
-Hand her over.
-Of course.

516
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:24,897
Easy, now.

517
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:28,317
Butterfingers.

518
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:41,872
Look out!

519
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:46,001
Help me!

520
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:50,714
-Help me!
-I'm coming!

521
00:50:55,928 --> 00:50:57,846
Hang on!

522
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:17,032
Help!

523
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:38,554
Thank you.

524
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,099
Aunt May.

525
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:46,270
You've stuck your webs
in my business for the last time.

526
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:49,481
Now you'll have this woman's death
on your conscience.

527
00:51:55,029 --> 00:51:56,655
Come on.

528
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:02,786
Shame on you.

529
00:52:35,194 --> 00:52:36,820
There you go.

530
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:41,157
Thank you.
Oh, have I been wrong about you.

531
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:42,576
We sure showed him.

532
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:44,495
What do you mean, "we"?

533
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:51,001
-Take me with you, Spider-Man.
-Take me.

534
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:21,115
-May I?
-Sure. Go ahead.

535
00:53:22,116 --> 00:53:24,034
Penny! Over here!

536
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:30,916
Leave it.

537
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:37,464
Hey. Might wanna take it easy, buddy.

538
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:38,882
Why? It's a party.

539
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:42,052
Wouldn't you be drinking if you lost
a bundle on some crackpot...

540
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:45,556
...who you thought was gonna take
you with him to fame and fortune?

541
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:47,641
Not to mention your friend the bug.

542
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:49,435
Not tonight, Harry.

543
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:53,063
Every night!
Until I find him, it's 24/7.

544
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:55,023
Parker!

545
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:56,900
Parker!

546
00:53:57,443 --> 00:54:00,529
Parker! What, are you deaf?
I called you twice.

547
00:54:00,696 --> 00:54:02,614
Think I'm paying you
to sip champagne?

548
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:04,825
Get a shot of my wife with the minister.

549
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:06,493
Beautiful tie.

550
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,912
Get a shot of us with the DA.

551
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:10,831
Beautiful dress.

552
00:54:11,247 --> 00:54:14,001
Here, get a shot of the mayor
and his girlfriend.

553
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:16,920
Wife.

554
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:21,216
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

555
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:24,428
The committee for
the Science Library of New York...

556
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:26,847
...is pleased to present
our guest of honor.

557
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:30,768
He's the first man to play football
on the moon.

558
00:54:31,852 --> 00:54:35,022
The handsome, the heroic,
the delicious...

559
00:54:35,189 --> 00:54:37,065
...Captain John Jameson.

560
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:23,278
Hi.

561
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:28,951
-You.
-Listen, I'm sorry.

562
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:31,245
But there was a disturbance.

563
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:32,830
I don't know you.

564
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:38,710
And I can't keep thinking about you.
It's too painful.

565
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,296
I've been reading poetry lately.

566
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:42,840
Whatever that means.

567
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:46,844
Day by day he gazed upon her

568
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:50,097
Day by day he sighed with passion
Day by day--

569
00:55:50,264 --> 00:55:52,140
Don't start.

570
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,269
Can I get you a drink?

571
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:57,312
I'm with John. He'll get me my drink.

572
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:59,606
John.

573
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:03,694
By the way, John has seen
my show five times.

574
00:56:03,861 --> 00:56:06,822
Harry has seen it twice.
Aunt May has seen it.

575
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:09,491
My sick mother got out of bed to see it.

576
00:56:09,658 --> 00:56:10,868
Even my father.

577
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:14,830
He came backstage to borrow cash.

578
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:20,836
But my best friend,
who cares so much about me...

579
00:56:21,003 --> 00:56:23,171
...can't make an 8:00 curtain.

580
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,425
After all these years...

581
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:30,345
...he's nothing to me but an empty seat.

582
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:59,207
It pisses me off, your loyalty to
Spider-Man and not to your best friend.

583
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:02,628
I find him with my father's body,
and you defend him.

584
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:04,796
-Take it easy.
-Don't push me.

585
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:06,840
Don't act like you're my friend.

586
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:09,593
You stole M.J. from me.

587
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:11,887
You stole my father's love.

588
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:17,559
Then you let him die because you
didn't turn in the freak. Isn't that right?

589
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:21,021
Huh? Isn't that right?

590
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:22,981
Huh, brother?

591
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:36,703
Ladies and gentlemen,
I just want you all to know...

592
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:41,875
...that the beautiful Miss Mary Jane
Watson has just agreed to marry me.

593
00:57:52,386 --> 00:57:53,845
What a surprise.

594
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:56,932
Parker, wake up! Wake up!
Shoot the picture!

595
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:26,294
Oh, no. No!

596
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,516
Why is this happening to me?

597
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:08,814
You seem very okay to me.

598
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:10,899
My diagnosis?

599
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:12,859
It's up here.

600
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:19,616
You say you can't sleep.
Heartbreak? Bad dreams?

601
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:23,495
There is one dream where...

602
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:25,413
...in my dream...

603
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:27,958
...I'm Spider-Man.

604
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:32,796
But I'm losing my powers.
I'm climbing a wall, but I keep falling.

605
01:00:36,508 --> 01:00:38,135
So you're Spider-Man.

606
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:39,511
In my dream.

607
01:00:39,678 --> 01:00:44,057
Actually, it's not even my dream.
It's a friend of mine's dream.

608
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:47,978
Somebody else's dream.

609
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:55,652
What about this friend?

610
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:59,156
Why does he climb these walls?
What does he think of himself?

611
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:03,577
That's the problem.
He doesn't know what to think.

612
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:07,998
Gotta make you mad not to know
who you are. Your soul disappears.

613
01:01:08,165 --> 01:01:09,916
Nothing as bad as uncertainty.

614
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:12,294
Listen...

615
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:17,424
...maybe you're not supposed to be
Spider-Man climbing those walls.

616
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:19,593
That's why you keep falling.

617
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:24,014
You always have a choice, Peter.

618
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:27,934
I have a choice.

619
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:40,030
All the things you've
been thinking about, Peter...

620
01:01:41,156 --> 01:01:42,574
...make me sad.

621
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:46,036
Can't you understand?

622
01:01:46,745 --> 01:01:49,039
I'm in love with Mary Jane.

623
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:52,918
Peter, all the times
we've talked of honesty...

624
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:56,213
...fairness, justice....

625
01:01:56,922 --> 01:02:01,676
Out of those times,
I counted on you to have the courage...

626
01:02:01,927 --> 01:02:05,764
...to take those dreams
out into the world.

627
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:09,434
I can't live your dreams anymore.

628
01:02:10,602 --> 01:02:12,437
I want a life of my own.

629
01:02:12,604 --> 01:02:14,731
You've been given a gift, Peter.

630
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:19,277
With great power
comes great responsibility.

631
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:25,575
Take my hand, son.

632
01:02:38,797 --> 01:02:40,465
No, Uncle Ben.

633
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,803
I'm just Peter Parker.

634
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:48,306
I'm Spider-Man...

635
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:50,725
...no more.

636
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:53,270
No more.

637
01:03:01,528 --> 01:03:02,988
No more.

638
01:04:31,993 --> 01:04:34,162
-You punk!
-Sorry.

639
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,706
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

640
01:04:44,172 --> 01:04:45,382
Hurry up!

641
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:58,770
And when the borderline is tau
equals zero, the eigenvalues are...?

642
01:04:58,937 --> 01:05:00,688
Someone, please?

643
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:05,151
.23 electron volts.

644
01:05:10,407 --> 01:05:13,284
Excellent work today, Parker.
Keep it up.

645
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,881
I'm not really wicked at all.
You mustn't think that I'm wicked.

646
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:30,009
If you are not, then you have
certainly been deceiving us all...

647
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:31,928
...in a very inexcusable manner.

648
01:05:32,095 --> 01:05:34,347
I hope you have not been
leading a double life...

649
01:05:34,514 --> 01:05:37,725
...pretending to be wicked
and being really good all the time.

650
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:39,644
That would be hypocrisy.

651
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:43,106
Of course, I have been
rather reckless.

652
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:50,405
"I am glad."

653
01:05:51,239 --> 01:05:53,283
"I am glad."

654
01:05:53,575 --> 01:05:55,326
"I am glad."

655
01:05:57,162 --> 01:05:59,289
Are you glad to hear it?

656
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:03,835
I am glad...

657
01:06:04,002 --> 01:06:05,378
...to hear it.

658
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:07,338
In fact, now you mention
the subject...

659
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:11,134
...I have been very bad
in my own small way.

660
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:16,055
You were so wonderful.
That was such a great play.

661
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:18,266
You could've told me
you were coming.

662
01:06:18,433 --> 01:06:20,768
I was afraid you'd say,
"Don't come."

663
01:06:24,481 --> 01:06:26,149
You look different.

664
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:31,821
I shined my shoes, pressed my pants,
did my homework.

665
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:33,865
I do my homework now.

666
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:37,827
You wanna get some chow mein?

667
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:39,412
Peter...

668
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:41,414
...I'm getting married.

669
01:06:46,336 --> 01:06:49,255
I always imagined you
getting married on a hilltop.

670
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:51,216
And who's the groom?

671
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:53,259
You hadn't decided yet.

672
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:57,805
You think just because
you saw my play...

673
01:06:57,972 --> 01:07:00,350
...you can talk me out
of getting married?

674
01:07:00,642 --> 01:07:03,853
You once told me you loved me.
I let things get in the way before.

675
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:07,524
There was something I thought
I had to do. I don't have to.

676
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:09,526
You're too late.

677
01:07:10,652 --> 01:07:12,028
Will you think about it?

678
01:07:12,195 --> 01:07:13,530
Think about what?

679
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:15,698
Picking up where we left off.

680
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:17,200
Where was that?

681
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:19,869
We never got on.
You can't get off if you don't get on.

682
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:21,412
I don't think it's that simple.

683
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:23,915
Of course you don't,
because you complicate things.

684
01:07:24,082 --> 01:07:25,667
You don't understand.

685
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:28,586
I'm not an empty seat anymore.

686
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:30,547
I'm different.

687
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:33,174
Punch me, I bleed.

688
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:41,933
I have to go.

689
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:51,234
I'm getting married in a church.

690
01:07:58,950 --> 01:08:00,493
You are different.

691
01:08:15,383 --> 01:08:18,511
Dear, we agreed to put on a wedding,
not go into bankruptcy.

692
01:08:19,304 --> 01:08:21,806
Caviar?
What, are we inviting the tsar?

693
01:08:21,973 --> 01:08:25,101
Get some cheese and crackers,
some of those little cocktail weenies.

694
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:28,438
I got a garbage man here says he's
got something you might want to see.

695
01:08:28,605 --> 01:08:32,317
If you have an extraterrestrial's head in
there, you're the third guy this week.

696
01:08:34,861 --> 01:08:36,696
Where the hell did you get that?

697
01:08:36,863 --> 01:08:38,406
In the garbage.

698
01:08:38,573 --> 01:08:39,991
In the garbage?

699
01:08:41,993 --> 01:08:43,786
He must've given up.

700
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:48,791
Thrown in the towel.
Abandoned his sad little masquerade.

701
01:08:49,626 --> 01:08:52,879
I finally got to him.
The power of the press triumphs.

702
01:08:53,046 --> 01:08:57,842
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now, look, I think
I deserve a little something for this.

703
01:08:58,009 --> 01:09:01,054
-Give you 50 bucks.
-I could get more than that on eBay.

704
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:04,307
All right, 100. Give this man his
money and throw in a bar of soap.

705
01:09:05,058 --> 01:09:07,018
Your wife is still on that line.

706
01:09:08,436 --> 01:09:10,188
Flowers? How much?

707
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:14,025
You spend any more on this thing,
you can pick the daisies off my grave.

708
01:09:14,192 --> 01:09:15,485
Get plastic.

709
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:18,196
Gotta go, big story.

710
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:32,543
Spider-Man
Spider-Man

711
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:35,713
Where have you gone to
Spider-Man?

712
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:39,300
Where have you gone to
Spider-Man?

713
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:49,060
Come on, man. Get the money.

714
01:09:50,728 --> 01:09:52,563
Come on, come on.

715
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:56,442
Help!

716
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:01,614
Come on!

717
01:10:08,121 --> 01:10:10,373
It wasn't fair to have gone like that.

718
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:12,709
He was a peaceful man.

719
01:10:14,711 --> 01:10:16,963
And it was all my doing.

720
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:53,249
Aunt May.
You don't have to punish yourself.

721
01:10:53,416 --> 01:10:55,418
Oh, I know I shouldn't.

722
01:10:55,793 --> 01:10:59,005
It's just that you wanted
to take the subway...

723
01:10:59,172 --> 01:11:01,340
...and he wanted to drive you.

724
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:04,218
If only I had stopped him.

725
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:07,847
We'd all three of us
be having tea together.

726
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:25,114
I'm responsible.

727
01:11:29,035 --> 01:11:30,286
For what?

728
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:33,498
For what happened to Uncle Ben.

729
01:11:33,664 --> 01:11:35,958
But you were at the library.

730
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:38,085
You were doing your homework.

731
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:41,380
He drove me to the library,
but I never went in.

732
01:11:42,215 --> 01:11:43,841
What do you mean?

733
01:11:44,592 --> 01:11:46,260
I went someplace else.

734
01:11:46,427 --> 01:11:49,430
Someplace where I thought
I could win some money...

735
01:11:50,598 --> 01:11:53,351
...to buy a car, because I wanted...

736
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:56,521
...to impress Mary Jane.

737
01:11:58,648 --> 01:12:00,691
It happened so fast.

738
01:12:01,818 --> 01:12:05,696
I won the money, and the guy
wouldn't pay me. Then he got robbed.

739
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:08,658
The thief...

740
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:11,619
...was running towards me.

741
01:12:13,204 --> 01:12:15,998
I could've stopped him, but I wanted...

742
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:18,292
...revenge.

743
01:12:20,294 --> 01:12:21,838
I let him go.

744
01:12:23,714 --> 01:12:26,676
I let him get away.

745
01:12:32,515 --> 01:12:34,308
He wanted a car.

746
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:36,727
He tried to take Uncle Ben's.

747
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:41,232
Uncle Ben said no...

748
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:44,902
...and then he shot him.

749
01:12:48,531 --> 01:12:52,201
Uncle Ben was killed that night...

750
01:12:53,828 --> 01:12:56,873
...for being the only one
who did the right thing.

751
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:01,377
And I....

752
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:06,841
I held his hand...

753
01:13:07,425 --> 01:13:09,051
...when he died.

754
01:13:16,642 --> 01:13:19,562
I've tried to tell you so many times.

755
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,454
Just one more little chore.

756
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:27,380
Where are you?

757
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:33,427
-I'm leaving for the night, sir.
-Fine.

758
01:14:33,594 --> 01:14:36,305
Your father only obsessed
over his work.

759
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:38,099
Good night, Bernard.

760
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:32,695
Hello, Harry.

761
01:15:32,862 --> 01:15:35,114
Otto. What do you want?

762
01:15:35,698 --> 01:15:37,283
That precious tritium.

763
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:39,869
But I need more of it this time.

764
01:15:41,579 --> 01:15:45,583
More tritium, are you crazy?
You'll destroy the city! You're a hack!

765
01:15:49,503 --> 01:15:51,464
Hey! Hey!

766
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:54,717
Stop! Stop! All right!

767
01:15:55,134 --> 01:15:58,888
All right, all right, all right.
Put me down. We'll make a deal.

768
01:16:08,773 --> 01:16:12,068
Kill Spider-Man,
I'll give you all the tritium you need.

769
01:16:12,902 --> 01:16:16,739
On second thought,
bring him to me alive.

770
01:16:16,906 --> 01:16:18,240
How do I find him?

771
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:21,118
-Peter Parker.
-Parker?

772
01:16:21,285 --> 01:16:23,621
He takes pictures of Spider-Man
for the Bugle.

773
01:16:23,788 --> 01:16:25,289
Make him tell you where he is.

774
01:16:31,045 --> 01:16:32,379
Have it ready.

775
01:16:36,175 --> 01:16:37,760
Don't hurt Peter!

776
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:53,400
Somebody, help!

777
01:16:54,318 --> 01:16:55,945
Fire!

778
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:07,123
Alisa, the Chens can't find
their daughter. Have you seen her?

779
01:17:08,499 --> 01:17:11,127
Somebody call the fire department!
Help!

780
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:14,171
-Help!
-Is anybody in that building?

781
01:17:14,338 --> 01:17:16,966
We think there's a kid
stuck on the second floor.

782
01:17:17,174 --> 01:17:18,843
Hey, where you going?!

783
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:41,448
I'm coming!

784
01:18:05,973 --> 01:18:08,851
It's okay. It's okay. Come here.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

785
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:11,437
Come on. Come on.

786
01:19:11,705 --> 01:19:13,666
Mama.

787
01:19:25,678 --> 01:19:27,263
You got some guts, kid.

788
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:32,017
Some poor soul got trapped
on the fourth floor. Never made it out.

789
01:19:32,268 --> 01:19:33,769
Oh, man.

790
01:19:36,647 --> 01:19:40,109
All right, Billy, let's knock it down
and roll them up. Get on out of here.

791
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:44,154
Let's pick it up! Let's get all this
equipment, let's go! Let's move it!

792
01:19:49,868 --> 01:19:52,871
Am I not supposed to have
what I want?

793
01:19:53,872 --> 01:19:55,332
What I need?

794
01:19:57,668 --> 01:20:00,129
What am I supposed to do?

795
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:08,304
I shouldn't have without...

796
01:20:08,971 --> 01:20:10,222
...knocking.

797
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:16,395
Come in.

798
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:21,984
-Hi.
-Hi.

799
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:28,240
Would you like a piece
of chocolate cake?

800
01:20:30,242 --> 01:20:31,493
Okay.

801
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:34,830
And a glass of milk?

802
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:39,501
That would be nice.

803
01:20:41,462 --> 01:20:43,589
Okay.

804
01:21:03,776 --> 01:21:05,611
Thank you.

805
01:21:10,366 --> 01:21:11,950
You got a message.

806
01:21:13,118 --> 01:21:14,578
It's your aunt.

807
01:21:14,745 --> 01:21:16,538
Thanks.

808
01:21:32,596 --> 01:21:33,931
What's going on?

809
01:21:34,098 --> 01:21:37,893
Oh, they gave me another few weeks,
but I decided the hell with it.

810
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:41,730
I'm moving on.
I found a small apartment.

811
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:43,399
Why didn't you tell me?

812
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:46,860
I'm quite able
to take care of things myself.

813
01:21:47,027 --> 01:21:50,406
And Henry Jackson across
the street is giving me a hand...

814
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:52,074
...and I'm giving him $5.

815
01:21:52,241 --> 01:21:53,867
That's Henry Jackson?

816
01:21:54,535 --> 01:21:56,620
Yes. It's funny what happens
in two years.

817
01:21:56,912 --> 01:22:00,374
Nine years old, has great ambitions.

818
01:22:02,042 --> 01:22:05,212
Listen, about my last visit....

819
01:22:05,504 --> 01:22:07,840
Pish-posh, we needn't talk about it.

820
01:22:08,006 --> 01:22:12,594
It's water over the dam or under
the bridge or wherever you like it.

821
01:22:16,056 --> 01:22:19,852
But you made a brave move
in telling me the truth.

822
01:22:20,102 --> 01:22:21,937
And I'm proud of you.

823
01:22:23,021 --> 01:22:25,441
And I thank you, and I....

824
01:22:26,692 --> 01:22:29,027
I love you, Peter.

825
01:22:30,279 --> 01:22:32,781
So very, very much.

826
01:22:52,259 --> 01:22:55,262
Hey. Where are all my comic books?

827
01:22:55,429 --> 01:22:58,348
Those dreadful things?
I gave those away.

828
01:23:01,351 --> 01:23:04,646
-I put the pans in the box, Mrs. Parker.
-Thank you, Henry.

829
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:06,315
-Hi, Peter.
-Hey, Henry.

830
01:23:06,565 --> 01:23:07,858
You're getting tall.

831
01:23:08,025 --> 01:23:12,154
Henry, why don't you put those
cookbooks in with the mixer.

832
01:23:12,321 --> 01:23:15,407
Okay. You take
Spider-Man's pictures, right?

833
01:23:16,325 --> 01:23:17,618
I used to.

834
01:23:17,784 --> 01:23:18,994
Where is he?

835
01:23:19,161 --> 01:23:23,499
Henry and I agree. We don't see
his picture in the paper anymore.

836
01:23:25,417 --> 01:23:26,960
He...

837
01:23:29,046 --> 01:23:31,548
-...quit.
-Why?

838
01:23:32,424 --> 01:23:34,343
Wanted to try other things.

839
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:36,053
He'll be back, right?

840
01:23:37,387 --> 01:23:38,680
I don't know.

841
01:23:40,098 --> 01:23:43,101
You'll never guess
who he wants to be.

842
01:23:43,519 --> 01:23:45,270
Spider-Man.

843
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:49,358
-Why?
-He knows a hero when he sees one.

844
01:23:49,525 --> 01:23:53,237
Too few characters out there,
flying around like that...

845
01:23:53,403 --> 01:23:55,447
...saving old girls like me.

846
01:23:55,614 --> 01:23:59,409
And Lord knows,
kids like Henry need a hero.

847
01:23:59,576 --> 01:24:02,454
Courageous, self-sacrificing people...

848
01:24:02,621 --> 01:24:04,957
...setting examples for all of us.

849
01:24:05,415 --> 01:24:07,751
Everybody loves a hero.

850
01:24:08,126 --> 01:24:11,547
People line up for them.
Cheer them. Scream their names.

851
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:15,801
And years later, they'll tell how
they stood in the rain for hours...

852
01:24:15,968 --> 01:24:17,761
...just to get a glimpse of the one...

853
01:24:17,928 --> 01:24:21,390
...who taught them to hold on
a second longer.

854
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:25,978
I believe there's a hero in all of us...

855
01:24:26,728 --> 01:24:28,564
...that keeps us honest...

856
01:24:29,231 --> 01:24:30,816
...gives us strength...

857
01:24:31,233 --> 01:24:33,110
...makes us noble...

858
01:24:34,236 --> 01:24:37,739
...and finally allows us to die
with pride.

859
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:43,078
Even though sometimes
we have to be steady...

860
01:24:43,245 --> 01:24:45,998
...and give up the thing
we want the most.

861
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:49,668
Even our dreams.

862
01:24:51,587 --> 01:24:54,298
Spider-Man did that for Henry...

863
01:24:54,464 --> 01:24:56,925
...and he wonders where he's gone.

864
01:24:58,093 --> 01:24:59,886
He needs him.

865
01:25:04,349 --> 01:25:09,104
Do you think you could lift that desk
and put it into the garage for me?

866
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:11,732
But don't strain yourself.

867
01:25:11,898 --> 01:25:13,525
Okay.

868
01:25:32,252 --> 01:25:34,463
Strong focus on what I want.

869
01:26:04,493 --> 01:26:06,078
I'm back!

870
01:26:06,244 --> 01:26:07,663
I'm back!

871
01:26:25,222 --> 01:26:26,640
My back.

872
01:26:27,557 --> 01:26:28,934
My back.

873
01:26:53,083 --> 01:26:57,421
Honey, you sure you don't want to
invite your friend, the photographer?

874
01:26:57,963 --> 01:26:59,214
Peter Parker?

875
01:27:01,383 --> 01:27:02,634
Positive.

876
01:27:02,884 --> 01:27:04,094
Thought he was your pal.

877
01:27:04,428 --> 01:27:06,763
-Peter Parker?
-Yeah.

878
01:27:07,681 --> 01:27:10,267
He's just a great big jerk.

879
01:27:10,559 --> 01:27:12,394
The world's full of great big jerks.

880
01:27:13,895 --> 01:27:15,689
You're adorable.

881
01:27:16,064 --> 01:27:17,691
It's just the uniform.

882
01:27:20,986 --> 01:27:23,071
Lean your head back for me.

883
01:27:23,405 --> 01:27:25,824
-Put my head back?
-Yeah, just do it.

884
01:27:27,868 --> 01:27:29,536
Just put my head back?

885
01:27:30,245 --> 01:27:31,872
Okay.

886
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:52,434
Wow.

887
01:27:53,226 --> 01:27:54,978
I'm back on the moon.

888
01:27:59,608 --> 01:28:01,109
You up there with me?

889
01:28:21,922 --> 01:28:24,090
-Hiya.
-Surprised?

890
01:28:24,257 --> 01:28:25,759
Very.

891
01:28:25,926 --> 01:28:27,469
Thanks for coming.

892
01:28:27,803 --> 01:28:29,763
Everything okay?

893
01:28:30,764 --> 01:28:32,474
You might say so.

894
01:28:33,809 --> 01:28:37,604
This is funny.
I'm not sure how to begin.

895
01:28:40,023 --> 01:28:42,651
You know how our minds
play tricks on us.

896
01:28:43,109 --> 01:28:46,988
-Tell me about it.
-Well, mine did a real number on me.

897
01:28:48,615 --> 01:28:52,285
Some part of me heard what you
had to say after the show that night...

898
01:28:52,452 --> 01:28:55,997
...that you were different.
But I didn't want to listen.

899
01:28:56,873 --> 01:28:58,875
I was afraid to trust you.

900
01:29:00,544 --> 01:29:03,588
But I've been thinking about it--

901
01:29:03,755 --> 01:29:07,425
Listen, there's more for me to say.

902
01:29:11,096 --> 01:29:15,308
I maybe rushed into things.
I thought--

903
01:29:15,475 --> 01:29:18,103
Wait a minute.
What are you saying?

904
01:29:18,812 --> 01:29:20,605
I'm saying....

905
01:29:26,778 --> 01:29:29,781
I thought I could be there for you,
Mary Jane...

906
01:29:30,323 --> 01:29:31,783
...but I can't.

907
01:29:35,203 --> 01:29:38,456
My mind was playing tricks too.

908
01:29:43,169 --> 01:29:45,755
Do you love me, or not?

909
01:29:52,804 --> 01:29:54,431
I...

910
01:29:57,684 --> 01:29:58,894
...don't.

911
01:30:03,815 --> 01:30:05,734
You don't.

912
01:30:15,285 --> 01:30:16,536
Kiss me.

913
01:30:18,747 --> 01:30:20,248
Kiss you?

914
01:30:20,414 --> 01:30:22,250
I need to know something.

915
01:30:24,836 --> 01:30:26,420
Just one kiss.

916
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:15,720
What's happening?

917
01:31:25,981 --> 01:31:27,607
Peter Parker...

918
01:31:28,482 --> 01:31:30,151
...and the girlfriend.

919
01:31:30,568 --> 01:31:32,404
What do you want?

920
01:31:35,198 --> 01:31:37,450
I want you to find your friend
Spider-Man.

921
01:31:37,617 --> 01:31:40,245
Tell him to meet me
at the Westside Tower at 3:00.

922
01:31:40,412 --> 01:31:42,580
I don't know where he is.

923
01:31:44,124 --> 01:31:45,625
Find him.

924
01:31:47,919 --> 01:31:50,755
Or I'll peel the flesh off her bones.

925
01:31:50,922 --> 01:31:52,966
If you lay one finger on her....

926
01:31:53,133 --> 01:31:54,467
You'll do what?

927
01:33:08,208 --> 01:33:11,920
Still no word on the whereabouts
of your son's fiancée.

928
01:33:12,087 --> 01:33:13,713
Sorry, Jonah.

929
01:33:14,756 --> 01:33:16,257
It's all my fault.

930
01:33:18,051 --> 01:33:20,386
I drove Spider-Man away.

931
01:33:20,637 --> 01:33:23,807
He was the only one who could've
stopped Octavius.

932
01:33:25,308 --> 01:33:26,559
Yes.

933
01:33:28,103 --> 01:33:31,439
Spider-Man was a hero.

934
01:33:32,649 --> 01:33:34,608
I just couldn't see it.

935
01:33:36,236 --> 01:33:37,654
He was a--

936
01:33:37,821 --> 01:33:40,490
A thief! A criminal!

937
01:33:42,075 --> 01:33:44,410
He stole my suit!
He's a menace to the entire city!

938
01:33:44,577 --> 01:33:47,580
I want that wall-crawling
arachnid prosecuted!

939
01:33:47,747 --> 01:33:49,833
I want him strung up by his web!

940
01:33:51,334 --> 01:33:54,003
I want Spider-Man!

941
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:23,825
Where is she?

942
01:34:23,992 --> 01:34:26,660
Oh, she'll be just fine. Let's talk.

943
01:35:17,879 --> 01:35:19,088
What the hell?

944
01:37:24,047 --> 01:37:26,132
You have a train to catch.

945
01:37:28,634 --> 01:37:30,470
Help!

946
01:37:30,636 --> 01:37:35,016
Help! Help! I can't stop it!
The brakes are gone!

947
01:37:53,785 --> 01:37:56,329
-It's Spider-Man.
-Oh, my God, this is it!

948
01:37:56,496 --> 01:37:58,039
Tell everyone to hang on!

949
01:37:58,206 --> 01:37:59,916
Brace yourselves!

950
01:38:21,104 --> 01:38:23,439
Any more bright ideas?

951
01:38:23,815 --> 01:38:26,150
I got a few, yeah!

952
01:38:47,505 --> 01:38:49,298
Whoa, watch out!

953
01:39:19,953 --> 01:39:21,205
We're slowing down.

954
01:40:25,603 --> 01:40:27,563
Nice and easy, we'll go down.

955
01:40:28,564 --> 01:40:30,066
Slower. Gently.

956
01:40:35,321 --> 01:40:36,656
Is he alive?

957
01:40:40,409 --> 01:40:41,661
He's...

958
01:40:41,827 --> 01:40:43,412
...just a kid.

959
01:40:44,580 --> 01:40:46,415
No older than my son.

960
01:41:05,768 --> 01:41:07,562
It's all right.

961
01:41:11,983 --> 01:41:13,818
We found something.

962
01:41:23,202 --> 01:41:25,246
We won't tell nobody.

963
01:41:38,926 --> 01:41:41,429
It's good to have you back, Spider-Man.

964
01:42:01,449 --> 01:42:03,284
He's mine!

965
01:42:04,076 --> 01:42:06,787
You want to get to him,
you got to go through me.

966
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:08,456
And me.

967
01:42:09,081 --> 01:42:10,458
Me too.

968
01:42:15,379 --> 01:42:16,964
Very well.

969
01:42:45,951 --> 01:42:47,912
Where do you want him?

970
01:42:55,711 --> 01:42:57,213
And the tritium?

971
01:43:11,727 --> 01:43:13,186
Yes.

972
01:43:43,216 --> 01:43:46,303
If only I could cause you the pain
that you've caused me.

973
01:43:49,056 --> 01:43:51,559
First we'll see who's behind the mask.

974
01:43:51,726 --> 01:43:54,186
I can look into your eyes as you die.

975
01:43:56,939 --> 01:43:58,482
Pete.

976
01:43:58,858 --> 01:44:00,568
No.

977
01:44:01,152 --> 01:44:02,570
It can't be.

978
01:44:09,118 --> 01:44:10,411
Harry.

979
01:44:11,954 --> 01:44:15,416
Where is she?
Where is he keeping her?

980
01:44:16,751 --> 01:44:20,755
-He's got M.J.
-No. All he wanted was the tritium.

981
01:44:21,464 --> 01:44:22,757
Tritium?

982
01:44:24,759 --> 01:44:26,761
He's making the machine again.

983
01:44:27,595 --> 01:44:31,807
When that happens, she'll die,
along with half of New York.

984
01:44:31,974 --> 01:44:34,769
-Now, where is he?
-Peter...

985
01:44:35,936 --> 01:44:37,772
...you killed my father.

986
01:44:42,943 --> 01:44:47,031
There are bigger things
happening here than me and you.

987
01:44:47,782 --> 01:44:50,534
Harry, please, I've got to stop him.

988
01:45:01,128 --> 01:45:02,838
Hey!

989
01:45:03,923 --> 01:45:05,591
Hey!

990
01:45:06,967 --> 01:45:08,761
I'm talking to you!

991
01:45:09,094 --> 01:45:12,598
You got what you needed for your little
science project, now let me go.

992
01:45:12,765 --> 01:45:14,725
I can't let you go,
you'd bring the police.

993
01:45:14,892 --> 01:45:18,145
Not that anybody could stop me
now that Spider-Man's dead.

994
01:45:18,311 --> 01:45:19,772
He's not dead.

995
01:45:20,022 --> 01:45:22,650
-I don't believe you.
-Believe it.

996
01:45:40,417 --> 01:45:41,752
Surprise.

997
01:45:46,173 --> 01:45:47,842
As soon as you get free--

998
01:45:50,010 --> 01:45:53,889
I should have known Osborn
wouldn't have the spine to finish you!

999
01:45:54,056 --> 01:45:57,184
Shut it down, Ock. You're going
to hurt a lot more people this time.

1000
01:45:57,393 --> 01:45:59,728
Well, that's a risk we're willing to take.

1001
01:46:00,855 --> 01:46:02,731
Well, I'm not.

1002
01:46:35,264 --> 01:46:36,515
Hang on, Mary Jane!

1003
01:46:52,448 --> 01:46:53,699
Run!

1004
01:47:18,265 --> 01:47:20,601
Let's see you scurry out of this.

1005
01:47:44,457 --> 01:47:46,669
Now what?

1006
01:48:16,782 --> 01:48:18,909
Dr. Octavius.

1007
01:48:22,121 --> 01:48:23,330
We have to shut it down.

1008
01:48:24,164 --> 01:48:25,749
Please tell me how.

1009
01:48:25,916 --> 01:48:27,334
Peter Parker?

1010
01:48:30,921 --> 01:48:32,965
"Brilliant but lazy."

1011
01:48:33,298 --> 01:48:34,675
Look at what's happening.

1012
01:48:35,676 --> 01:48:37,553
We must destroy it.

1013
01:48:43,183 --> 01:48:44,810
I can't destroy it.

1014
01:48:50,065 --> 01:48:51,400
I won't.

1015
01:48:56,989 --> 01:48:59,199
You once spoke to me
about intelligence.

1016
01:49:01,035 --> 01:49:04,747
That it was a gift to be used
for the good of mankind.

1017
01:49:06,457 --> 01:49:07,875
A privilege.

1018
01:49:08,541 --> 01:49:11,587
These things have turned you
into something you're not.

1019
01:49:12,629 --> 01:49:14,506
Don't listen to them.

1020
01:49:20,387 --> 01:49:21,930
It was my dream.

1021
01:49:22,097 --> 01:49:26,602
Sometimes, to do what's right,
we have to be steady...

1022
01:49:26,769 --> 01:49:29,313
...and give up the thing
we want the most.

1023
01:49:30,105 --> 01:49:31,774
Even our dreams.

1024
01:49:37,780 --> 01:49:39,406
You're right.

1025
01:49:46,830 --> 01:49:48,707
He's right.

1026
01:49:50,417 --> 01:49:52,044
Listen.

1027
01:49:54,254 --> 01:49:56,507
Listen to me now.

1028
01:49:59,426 --> 01:50:01,762
Listen to me now.

1029
01:50:05,432 --> 01:50:08,435
Now, tell me how to stop it.

1030
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:11,188
It can't be stopped.

1031
01:50:12,605 --> 01:50:14,607
It's self-sustaining now.

1032
01:50:14,858 --> 01:50:16,944
-Think!
-Unless....

1033
01:50:18,487 --> 01:50:20,239
The river.

1034
01:50:21,614 --> 01:50:23,200
Drown it.

1035
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:26,495
I'll do it.

1036
01:51:11,832 --> 01:51:14,543
No!

1037
01:51:26,555 --> 01:51:28,182
Hi.

1038
01:51:28,849 --> 01:51:30,475
Hi.

1039
01:51:31,268 --> 01:51:32,728
This is really heavy.

1040
01:51:57,294 --> 01:51:59,254
M.J.

1041
01:52:00,047 --> 01:52:01,882
In case we die....

1042
01:52:02,049 --> 01:52:03,634
You do love me.

1043
01:52:04,218 --> 01:52:05,469
I do.

1044
01:52:06,428 --> 01:52:08,555
Even though you said you didn't.

1045
01:52:11,433 --> 01:52:13,894
I will not die a monster.

1046
01:53:19,126 --> 01:53:21,211
I think I always knew...

1047
01:53:22,296 --> 01:53:23,922
...all this time...

1048
01:53:25,090 --> 01:53:26,883
...who you really were.

1049
01:53:27,467 --> 01:53:30,053
Then you know
why we can't be together.

1050
01:53:31,263 --> 01:53:34,141
Spider-Man will always have enemies.

1051
01:53:36,059 --> 01:53:38,770
I can't let you take that risk.

1052
01:53:43,483 --> 01:53:44,817
I will...

1053
01:53:46,486 --> 01:53:48,780
...always be Spider-Man.

1054
01:53:51,533 --> 01:53:53,910
You and I can never be.

1055
01:54:42,292 --> 01:54:44,294
Mary Jane!

1056
01:55:47,399 --> 01:55:49,067
Hello?

1057
01:56:05,083 --> 01:56:06,418
Who's that?

1058
01:56:06,585 --> 01:56:08,503
Son.

1059
01:56:09,629 --> 01:56:10,964
I'm here.

1060
01:56:12,299 --> 01:56:13,925
Dad?

1061
01:56:14,968 --> 01:56:17,179
-I thought you were--
-No.

1062
01:56:17,679 --> 01:56:19,806
I'm alive in you, Harry.

1063
01:56:19,973 --> 01:56:21,183
Now it's your turn.

1064
01:56:22,767 --> 01:56:25,437
You swore to make Spider-Man pay.

1065
01:56:25,812 --> 01:56:27,481
Now make him pay.

1066
01:56:27,981 --> 01:56:29,608
But Pete's my best friend.

1067
01:56:29,816 --> 01:56:31,318
And I'm your father.

1068
01:56:32,319 --> 01:56:33,778
You're weak.

1069
01:56:34,779 --> 01:56:39,117
You were always weak. You'll always
be weak until you take control.

1070
01:56:40,160 --> 01:56:42,996
Now you know the truth about Peter.

1071
01:56:43,955 --> 01:56:45,457
Be strong, Harry.

1072
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:47,876
Avenge me.

1073
01:56:50,712 --> 01:56:52,756
-Avenge me!
-No!

1074
01:59:17,400 --> 01:59:18,818
Call Deborah.

1075
01:59:18,985 --> 01:59:20,820
The caterer?

1076
01:59:21,821 --> 01:59:23,907
Tell her not to open the caviar.

1077
02:00:05,281 --> 02:00:07,450
Had to do what I had to do.

1078
02:00:09,119 --> 02:00:10,453
Mary Jane.

1079
02:00:11,621 --> 02:00:12,872
Peter.

1080
02:00:14,124 --> 02:00:16,543
I can't survive without you.

1081
02:00:26,553 --> 02:00:28,388
You shouldn't be here.

1082
02:00:29,514 --> 02:00:32,559
I know you think we can't be together.

1083
02:00:33,685 --> 02:00:37,355
But can't you respect me enough
to let me make my own decision?

1084
02:00:38,606 --> 02:00:40,442
I know there'll be risks.

1085
02:00:41,276 --> 02:00:43,862
But I want to face them with you.

1086
02:00:45,029 --> 02:00:48,408
It's wrong that
we should only be half-alive...

1087
02:00:48,575 --> 02:00:50,326
...half of ourselves.

1088
02:00:52,787 --> 02:00:54,414
I love you.

1089
02:00:56,708 --> 02:00:59,627
So here I am,
standing in your doorway.

1090
02:01:01,379 --> 02:01:04,466
I've always been
standing in your doorway.

1091
02:01:11,514 --> 02:01:15,059
Isn't it about time somebody
saved your life?

1092
02:01:20,982 --> 02:01:22,817
Well, say something.

1093
02:01:25,320 --> 02:01:27,822
Thank you, Mary Jane Watson.

1094
02:01:44,005 --> 02:01:45,799
Go get them, tiger.
