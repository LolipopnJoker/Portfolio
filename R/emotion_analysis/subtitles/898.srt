1
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,088
Clouseau.

2
00:00:46,251 --> 00:00:49,789
Yes, well, the first time
I ever heard that name...

3
00:00:49,955 --> 00:00:52,561
Clouseau was just a little nobody.

4
00:00:52,725 --> 00:00:57,140
A police officer in some little village
far outside of Paris.

5
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:01,236
He was the village idiot
as far as I could tell.

6
00:01:28,394 --> 00:01:30,374
Idiot, pull up.

7
00:01:39,204 --> 00:01:42,845
Monsieur Dumont, you must
move your vehicle immediately.

8
00:01:43,008 --> 00:01:45,215
I am so sorry, Officer Clouseau.

9
00:01:45,944 --> 00:01:48,151
My chair, it won't move.

10
00:01:49,882 --> 00:01:51,589
Here's your problem.

11
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,731
Your battery cable has come undone.
Let me help.

12
00:01:54,887 --> 00:01:57,993
Let's see.
The positive to the negative.

13
00:01:58,157 --> 00:02:00,797
The negative to the positive there.

14
00:02:01,393 --> 00:02:03,999
All right, you are ready to go.

15
00:02:09,468 --> 00:02:12,415
All clear, keep it moving.

16
00:02:13,038 --> 00:02:15,075
As chief inspector
of the Police Nationale...

17
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,416
I hear many stories
of our officers in the field.

18
00:02:19,978 --> 00:02:22,754
Clouseau generated many...

19
00:02:23,315 --> 00:02:24,555
many stories.

20
00:02:25,451 --> 00:02:28,261
You are under arrest
for the murder of Pierre Fuquet.

21
00:02:29,888 --> 00:02:32,528
You are under arrest
for the murder of Pierre Fuquet.

22
00:02:34,359 --> 00:02:36,896
You are under arrest
for the murder of Pierre Fuquet.

23
00:02:37,262 --> 00:02:38,764
Pierre Fuquet?

24
00:02:39,965 --> 00:02:42,036
The case is closed.

25
00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:45,277
Needless to say...

26
00:02:45,437 --> 00:02:50,614
Clouseau did not qualify
for any advancement whatsoever.

27
00:02:50,776 --> 00:02:54,087
I never thought for a moment
I would have any use for him...

28
00:02:54,246 --> 00:02:56,920
until that fateful day.

29
00:02:58,116 --> 00:03:01,996
It was a perfect day for a murder.

30
00:03:02,154 --> 00:03:06,694
France against China, with the winner
advancing to the finals.

31
00:03:07,326 --> 00:03:11,968
I had been invited, as chief inspector
of the Police Nationale.

32
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:16,010
And because of my recent nomination
for the Medal of Honor.

33
00:03:16,168 --> 00:03:19,547
I have been nominated seven times.

34
00:03:20,005 --> 00:03:22,144
I have never won.

35
00:03:22,307 --> 00:03:26,619
But still, seven nominations...

36
00:03:26,778 --> 00:03:28,382
that's something.

37
00:03:28,747 --> 00:03:33,560
Anyway, the coach of
the French team, Yves Gluant...

38
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:37,223
came out for
his customary ovation.

39
00:03:39,591 --> 00:03:42,765
He raised his fist to the crowd.

40
00:03:42,928 --> 00:03:44,168
On it...

41
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:46,331
The Pink Panther diamond.

42
00:03:51,637 --> 00:03:56,279
It was quite the symbol of pride
and victory for the French team.

43
00:03:57,242 --> 00:03:59,779
Gluant's girlfriend at that time...

44
00:03:59,945 --> 00:04:03,722
was Xania,
the international pop star.

45
00:04:03,882 --> 00:04:07,091
They had been having
quite a stormy affair.

46
00:04:34,913 --> 00:04:38,087
By the end of regulation time
the score was tied...

47
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,323
and the game
went into sudden death.

48
00:04:42,487 --> 00:04:45,764
For a patriotic Frenchman
and a true fan like myself...

49
00:04:45,924 --> 00:04:49,770
it was almost
too thrilling to believe.

50
00:04:50,495 --> 00:04:51,974
And then...

51
00:04:52,364 --> 00:04:54,537
the miracle.

52
00:05:09,481 --> 00:05:11,358
Yes! Yeah!

53
00:05:11,516 --> 00:05:14,326
Yes!

54
00:05:14,953 --> 00:05:16,523
Yes!

55
00:05:32,938 --> 00:05:35,316
Yes!

56
00:05:39,678 --> 00:05:44,559
And then, in front of a stadium
filled with people...

57
00:05:44,716 --> 00:05:47,356
Gluant collapsed...

58
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,930
dead.

59
00:05:49,888 --> 00:05:53,734
A poison dart in his neck.

60
00:05:53,892 --> 00:05:57,237
And the Pink Panther diamond...

61
00:05:59,031 --> 00:06:01,807
had disappeared.

62
00:09:11,957 --> 00:09:15,530
The newspapers fed on
Gluant's murder with a frenzy.

63
00:09:15,694 --> 00:09:18,197
For them, the world had stopped.

64
00:09:18,363 --> 00:09:19,603
For me...

65
00:09:20,131 --> 00:09:23,977
it was an opportunity
for my greatest triumph.

66
00:09:26,438 --> 00:09:28,611
I know what we need
for the Gluant case.

67
00:09:29,407 --> 00:09:31,751
- What?
- An incompetent.

68
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:36,757
An unimaginative, by-the-book,
low-level incompetent...

69
00:09:36,915 --> 00:09:40,021
who will plod along,
getting nowhere...

70
00:09:40,185 --> 00:09:42,791
with the media
watching his every step.

71
00:09:42,954 --> 00:09:45,195
And while he is getting nowhere...

72
00:09:45,357 --> 00:09:48,463
I will put together the finest team
of investigators in France...

73
00:09:48,627 --> 00:09:51,870
and we will hunt down the killer,
retrieve the Pink Panther diamond...

74
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:55,273
and then the Medal of Honor
will be mine.

75
00:09:55,767 --> 00:09:58,111
And who is this incompetent?

76
00:09:58,503 --> 00:10:03,350
Oh, I think I know
the perfect man for the job.

77
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:08,157
Find him and bring him to Paris.

78
00:10:08,613 --> 00:10:12,060
His name is Clouseau.

79
00:11:29,661 --> 00:11:31,106
Good morning, mademoiselle.

80
00:11:31,963 --> 00:11:34,409
I'll be right with you.

81
00:11:37,936 --> 00:11:40,780
The minister of justice sent around
a new picture of himself...

82
00:11:40,939 --> 00:11:43,715
but it was bigger than
Chief Inspector Dreyfus' picture.

83
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,082
So the chief inspector
had a larger one made.

84
00:11:46,244 --> 00:11:49,748
You'll find that Paris
can be a very political place.

85
00:11:49,914 --> 00:11:53,862
Yes, politics, where greed
wears the mask of morality.

86
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:56,727
That's good. Did you say that?

87
00:11:59,724 --> 00:12:00,964
Yes, I did.

88
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,733
- Could you help me down?
- Oh, yes, of course.

89
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,740
Oh, yes. Here, just... perhaps...

90
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,814
- Yes, I...
- All right.

91
00:12:13,972 --> 00:12:16,179
- Wait.
- Yeah.

92
00:12:16,341 --> 00:12:19,550
Don't jump. Yes, that's good.
All right.

93
00:12:19,711 --> 00:12:23,022
I think if you put
your leg right there...

94
00:12:23,181 --> 00:12:25,923
- Okay.
- Yes. Okay.

95
00:12:27,385 --> 00:12:28,955
Yes.

96
00:12:30,555 --> 00:12:32,933
- I can't see anything.
- Maybe over here?

97
00:12:33,091 --> 00:12:35,196
- Yes, okay.
- Okay.

98
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,397
Over here.

99
00:12:42,801 --> 00:12:44,872
The inspector will see you now.

100
00:12:45,637 --> 00:12:47,913
He'll be right with you.

101
00:12:51,476 --> 00:12:52,784
Clouseau.

102
00:12:52,944 --> 00:12:55,220
- Clouseau.
- He's coming in.

103
00:12:56,381 --> 00:12:57,826
Good.

104
00:13:01,953 --> 00:13:05,162
Officer Jacques Clouseau,
gendarme, third class.

105
00:13:15,834 --> 00:13:20,146
- That had to hurt.
- No. No, not at all. No.

106
00:13:20,305 --> 00:13:22,546
Clouseau, the reason
we called you here...

107
00:13:23,341 --> 00:13:27,312
It is lovely weather we are having.

108
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:32,724
I hope the weather continues.

109
00:13:39,491 --> 00:13:41,437
The area is secure.

110
00:13:41,593 --> 00:13:43,231
Oh, thank you.

111
00:13:43,394 --> 00:13:46,534
Clouseau, I have reviewed
your records, and it is clear to me...

112
00:13:46,698 --> 00:13:50,271
that a man of your talent
merits greater responsibility...

113
00:13:50,435 --> 00:13:52,244
than you have had
up to this point.

114
00:13:52,403 --> 00:13:55,714
I have decided to promote you
to inspector...

115
00:13:55,874 --> 00:13:59,378
the highest rank of any officer
in the republic.

116
00:13:59,544 --> 00:14:01,114
- Inspector?
- Exactly.

117
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,987
And your first case
is the Gluant murder...

118
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:06,595
and theft of
the Pink Panther diamond.

119
00:14:06,751 --> 00:14:08,162
- I am honored.
- Good.

120
00:14:08,653 --> 00:14:11,190
Jacques Clouseau,
by the power vested in me...

121
00:14:11,356 --> 00:14:15,805
I hereby appoint you
full inspector...

122
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,906
with all of the...

123
00:14:24,936 --> 00:14:28,315
Here, if you would be so kind,
please.

124
00:14:29,207 --> 00:14:30,584
Oh, here, take my pen.

125
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,548
Thank you.

126
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:39,627
One does not often see
the traditional French fountain pen.

127
00:14:44,255 --> 00:14:47,065
I will cherish this forever.

128
00:14:47,392 --> 00:14:49,963
No. It is not a gift.

129
00:14:50,128 --> 00:14:53,007
That was given to me
by the mayor of Paris.

130
00:14:53,731 --> 00:14:55,176
Well, then...

131
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,778
I cannot accept this.

132
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,972
The press conference.

133
00:15:01,973 --> 00:15:04,817
Yes. Clouseau, there is
a press conference...

134
00:15:04,976 --> 00:15:07,923
in just a few minutes
down the hall...

135
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,786
to introduce you to the media.

136
00:15:09,948 --> 00:15:12,224
We'll meet you there.
And, Clouseau?

137
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,828
Yes?

138
00:15:14,586 --> 00:15:15,826
Good luck.

139
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,100
Good luck to you.

140
00:15:18,256 --> 00:15:20,759
And where is the press conference?

141
00:15:21,192 --> 00:15:22,762
Go under the arch...

142
00:15:22,927 --> 00:15:25,703
through the door on the right
and down the hall.

143
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,145
Well...

144
00:15:34,939 --> 00:15:37,681
The area is still secure.

145
00:15:39,077 --> 00:15:40,784
Thank you.

146
00:15:44,082 --> 00:15:45,789
He's perfect.

147
00:15:46,784 --> 00:15:50,027
Yes, we have definitely
found our man.

148
00:15:50,188 --> 00:15:51,963
Why do I feel wet?

149
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,670
Because of the unique nature
of the crime...

150
00:15:54,826 --> 00:15:57,864
we have brought in a man
specially suited to the case.

151
00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:00,976
Inspector Jacques Clouseau.

152
00:16:06,704 --> 00:16:07,876
Inspector.

153
00:16:08,373 --> 00:16:09,852
Inspector.

154
00:16:11,142 --> 00:16:13,679
- Yes?
- Yes, what's your initial premise?

155
00:16:14,412 --> 00:16:16,392
That Gluant did not
want to be killed.

156
00:16:16,547 --> 00:16:19,756
Everything else follows
like liquid mercury...

157
00:16:19,917 --> 00:16:22,761
flowing down a... a...

158
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,992
a sloping thing.

159
00:16:26,157 --> 00:16:28,831
How long do you think
it will take to find the killer?

160
00:16:28,993 --> 00:16:32,702
Right now the killer is being
surrounded by a web of deduction...

161
00:16:32,864 --> 00:16:36,038
forensic science
and the latest in technology...

162
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,511
such as two-way radios
and e-mail.

163
00:16:40,104 --> 00:16:44,610
Assign a man to be his driver who can
report on his whereabouts at all times.

164
00:16:44,776 --> 00:16:46,778
What kind of man?

165
00:16:46,944 --> 00:16:50,949
A man who follows orders
and doesn't ask questions.

166
00:16:51,482 --> 00:16:54,759
Inspector, do you know if the killer
was a man or a woman?

167
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:58,731
Well, of course I know that.
What else is there? A kitten?

168
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:00,801
Excuse me,
do you think it's possible...

169
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,131
that the killer could be
watching you now?

170
00:17:03,294 --> 00:17:06,002
Well, if I was a killer,
I would certainly be watching...

171
00:17:06,164 --> 00:17:08,371
and possibly taping
for later playback...

172
00:17:08,533 --> 00:17:12,606
because, you know, it's a big deal
to be talked about on TV.

173
00:17:13,137 --> 00:17:14,946
But I have a message for the killer.

174
00:17:15,707 --> 00:17:17,880
There is no place you can hide.

175
00:17:18,042 --> 00:17:20,989
There is no place
you cannot be seen.

176
00:17:21,145 --> 00:17:24,149
Killer, I will find you...

177
00:17:24,315 --> 00:17:26,659
because I am
a servant of the nation.

178
00:17:26,818 --> 00:17:29,196
Because justice is justice...

179
00:17:29,354 --> 00:17:33,496
and because France is France.

180
00:17:47,305 --> 00:17:50,252
- Bonjour, Nicole.
- Good morning, inspector.

181
00:17:50,408 --> 00:17:52,319
Welcome to your new office.

182
00:17:52,477 --> 00:17:55,287
You should probably start
by going through these files.

183
00:17:57,382 --> 00:18:01,660
It is lovely weather we are having.

184
00:18:04,389 --> 00:18:06,767
I hope the weather...

185
00:18:06,924 --> 00:18:09,427
stays this mild.

186
00:18:19,036 --> 00:18:22,711
If the weather continues...

187
00:18:22,874 --> 00:18:28,722
we are in for a lovely summer.

188
00:18:34,051 --> 00:18:35,530
The area is secure.

189
00:18:35,686 --> 00:18:38,462
- Are you all right?
- Well, of course I'm all right.

190
00:18:38,623 --> 00:18:40,625
And what is that?

191
00:18:40,792 --> 00:18:43,363
- What?
- Nothing.

192
00:18:44,128 --> 00:18:48,668
You should probably start
by looking at these files. You have to...

193
00:18:58,643 --> 00:19:01,123
My leg, it crushed my leg!

194
00:19:10,755 --> 00:19:13,463
Being an inspector,
you'll need some new clothes.

195
00:19:13,724 --> 00:19:16,398
I can take your measurements
and have something sent over.

196
00:19:16,561 --> 00:19:18,268
- Of course.
- Please remove your jacket.

197
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:19,965
Yes.

198
00:19:20,865 --> 00:19:24,438
- Do you live by yourself, inspector?
- Yes, I do.

199
00:19:25,336 --> 00:19:26,576
Do you get lonely?

200
00:19:26,737 --> 00:19:28,978
No, not really.
Not since the Internet.

201
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,144
Well, that takes care of that.
And welcome to Paris.

202
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,051
Thank you.

203
00:19:34,545 --> 00:19:36,388
Good morning, monsieur.

204
00:19:36,581 --> 00:19:38,288
And you are?

205
00:19:38,449 --> 00:19:40,929
Gilbert Ponton.
Detective, second class.

206
00:19:41,085 --> 00:19:42,792
I've been assigned to work with you.

207
00:19:42,954 --> 00:19:45,195
What qualifications do you have
for police work?

208
00:19:45,356 --> 00:19:48,030
My family's done police work
in Paris for nine generations.

209
00:19:48,192 --> 00:19:51,730
- And before that?
- We were policemen for 200 years.

210
00:19:51,896 --> 00:19:54,502
- And before that?
- Immigrants from countries in Europe.

211
00:19:54,665 --> 00:19:56,838
- All involved in police work.
- And before that?

212
00:19:57,001 --> 00:19:58,605
Farmers.

213
00:19:59,737 --> 00:20:03,947
So you are a little lamb who has
come to Clouseau for to learn.

214
00:20:04,475 --> 00:20:08,981
Gilbert Ponton, I vow to teach you
everything I know about police work.

215
00:20:09,146 --> 00:20:10,420
And together...

216
00:20:10,581 --> 00:20:13,619
we are going to catch a killer.

217
00:20:16,721 --> 00:20:17,961
There.

218
00:20:18,122 --> 00:20:21,899
The Chinese VIP box,
right on the edge of the kill zone.

219
00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:26,201
The poison was Chinese.
Was Gluant ever in China?

220
00:20:26,364 --> 00:20:28,935
Three years ago, he took a group
of French stars there...

221
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,579
for some exhibition games.

222
00:20:31,135 --> 00:20:33,479
Gluant was in China.

223
00:20:33,638 --> 00:20:35,549
The poison is from China.

224
00:20:35,706 --> 00:20:37,777
The Chinese are from China.

225
00:20:38,109 --> 00:20:43,115
It may be too early to say for certain,
but I think our killer is Chinese.

226
00:20:43,281 --> 00:20:45,591
Corbeille, I want you
on the next flight to Beijing.

227
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,629
Find out what Gluant did there,
who he saw, where he went.

228
00:20:49,487 --> 00:20:52,934
Pacquette, I want a dossier
on every Chinaman in that box.

229
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,433
Go, go, go, go, go.

230
00:21:02,033 --> 00:21:03,876
Inspector, it's awfully late and...

231
00:21:04,302 --> 00:21:06,873
Oh, I'm just going over
these crime-scene photos.

232
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:10,508
- Don't you need some rest?
- Crime does not rest, Nicole.

233
00:21:10,675 --> 00:21:12,018
It's true.

234
00:21:12,176 --> 00:21:13,883
You see...

235
00:21:14,045 --> 00:21:16,525
I have waited a long time
to prove myself.

236
00:21:17,148 --> 00:21:19,788
And I've been given
the opportunity of a lifetime.

237
00:21:20,184 --> 00:21:23,597
And I intend to show the world
exactly who I am.

238
00:21:23,754 --> 00:21:27,065
And what I can do.
I must not fail.

239
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:30,866
You won't. I know it.

240
00:21:31,028 --> 00:21:32,974
Thank you, Nicole.

241
00:21:36,467 --> 00:21:38,469
- Nicole?
- Yes?

242
00:21:38,803 --> 00:21:41,079
May I be very frank with you?

243
00:21:41,639 --> 00:21:42,879
Of course.

244
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,680
You have put on a ton of weight.

245
00:21:45,843 --> 00:21:48,483
Now, what I do
when I get a little heavy...

246
00:21:50,815 --> 00:21:52,556
Never mind.

247
00:21:52,984 --> 00:21:55,328
Would you like me to stay behind
and help you?

248
00:21:57,622 --> 00:21:59,659
That is a generous offer, Nicole...

249
00:21:59,824 --> 00:22:03,465
but I am quite sensitive
to office gender politics.

250
00:22:03,628 --> 00:22:06,370
And in today's world,
the slightest gesture...

251
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:09,909
can be misinterpreted
as harassment.

252
00:22:10,067 --> 00:22:14,174
And it is late, and I would prefer
not to put you or me...

253
00:22:14,338 --> 00:22:17,319
into that delicate situation.

254
00:22:17,475 --> 00:22:18,920
Agreed?

255
00:22:19,076 --> 00:22:20,578
Yes, I agree.

256
00:22:20,745 --> 00:22:24,318
Well, let's seal it with a kiss.
And I'll get back to work.

257
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,952
I am going to be frank.

258
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:30,190
Since you are only a detective,
second class...

259
00:22:30,354 --> 00:22:32,527
your senses may not be as sharp
as my own.

260
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:35,170
And as I do not want a partner
who makes me duller...

261
00:22:35,326 --> 00:22:38,933
I have come up with a plan
to keep you as sharp as possible.

262
00:22:39,096 --> 00:22:40,769
And what is that?

263
00:22:40,931 --> 00:22:44,640
Intermittently, and without warning,
I will attack you...

264
00:22:44,802 --> 00:22:47,476
whenever and wherever
it is least expected.

265
00:22:47,905 --> 00:22:51,443
In this way, I will keep you
vigilant and alert. Agreed?

266
00:22:52,309 --> 00:22:53,617
Yes.

267
00:22:55,479 --> 00:22:58,119
- Good one.
- Thank you.

268
00:22:59,383 --> 00:23:00,919
Here we are.

269
00:23:06,824 --> 00:23:09,464
Do not open door
when light is flashing.

270
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:30,454
Excuse me.

271
00:23:30,614 --> 00:23:33,026
Coming through. Thank you.

272
00:23:42,993 --> 00:23:44,802
And I'm wondering if you... Yes.

273
00:23:44,962 --> 00:23:48,432
I'm wondering if you saw, perhaps,
a person yelling.

274
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:51,705
Stop! Stop, stop!

275
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,172
Who are you,
and what the hell are you doing?

276
00:23:55,606 --> 00:23:58,553
- I'm in the middle of an interrogation.
- The booth is soundproof.

277
00:23:58,709 --> 00:24:01,280
She can't hear a word.
And in case you haven't noticed...

278
00:24:01,445 --> 00:24:03,789
You ruined my recording session.
Now, get out.

279
00:24:03,948 --> 00:24:06,622
Unless you want to be charged
with obstruction of justice...

280
00:24:06,784 --> 00:24:08,457
you will let me interrogate Xania.

281
00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:11,395
It's all right, Roland.
Hello, inspector.

282
00:24:11,555 --> 00:24:13,057
I'm Xania.

283
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:17,236
You do not know this, but I am
intimately familiar with your work.

284
00:24:18,162 --> 00:24:20,142
You are very kind.

285
00:24:22,633 --> 00:24:24,738
Did you say that booth
was soundproof?

286
00:24:25,569 --> 00:24:26,809
Yes.

287
00:24:47,258 --> 00:24:50,728
Now, you were nearby
when Gluant was killed?

288
00:24:50,895 --> 00:24:53,603
Yes, I ran out to be with him
after the team won.

289
00:24:53,764 --> 00:24:55,004
Of course you did.

290
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,504
Now, a few hours
before the murder...

291
00:24:57,835 --> 00:25:01,806
six witnesses saw you repeatedly
striking the deceased and screaming...

292
00:25:01,972 --> 00:25:03,383
What was it, Ponton?

293
00:25:03,541 --> 00:25:06,317
I am going to kill you.
I am going to kill you.

294
00:25:06,477 --> 00:25:09,924
I was angry.
I caught him with another woman.

295
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,356
And this was after
he said he loved me.

296
00:25:12,516 --> 00:25:14,587
You poor little angel waif.

297
00:25:15,586 --> 00:25:17,827
After he cheated on me...

298
00:25:18,422 --> 00:25:20,333
I hated him.

299
00:25:20,758 --> 00:25:23,068
- But I didn't kill him.
- Of course you didn't.

300
00:25:23,227 --> 00:25:25,867
- You recently performed in China...
- Stop browbeating her!

301
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:28,510
Can't you see she's sexy?

302
00:25:29,867 --> 00:25:31,642
Three months ago in Shanghai.

303
00:25:32,069 --> 00:25:35,278
Can you think of anyone else
who might have hated Gluant?

304
00:25:35,606 --> 00:25:38,416
- Bizu.
- The football star?

305
00:25:38,843 --> 00:25:42,052
I was dating Bizu when I met Gluant.

306
00:25:42,379 --> 00:25:45,383
He thought Gluant was a bad guy
for stealing me away.

307
00:25:45,549 --> 00:25:48,621
- If you ask me, they were both...
- You, don't leave town.

308
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,732
But I'm flying to Montserrat
to record Rene Duchanel...

309
00:25:51,889 --> 00:25:55,063
You will not leave town. I may want
to ask you a few more questions.

310
00:25:55,326 --> 00:25:57,101
But I don't know anything.

311
00:25:57,261 --> 00:26:02,108
About life, about love.
Yes, you little wet puppy.

312
00:26:02,266 --> 00:26:04,507
But about the crime
you may know a lot.

313
00:26:04,668 --> 00:26:06,579
Inspector.

314
00:26:07,638 --> 00:26:09,311
Do I have to stay in town?

315
00:26:09,473 --> 00:26:11,248
Because next week
I have something...

316
00:26:12,509 --> 00:26:14,614
vague to do in New York.

317
00:26:14,945 --> 00:26:17,755
Well, if you absolutely have
to do something vague...

318
00:26:17,915 --> 00:26:19,485
feel free to go where you wish.

319
00:26:39,403 --> 00:26:43,180
I can't take you to Bizu, but I can
take you to Monsieur Vainqueur...

320
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,820
the team's assistant coach.

321
00:26:45,976 --> 00:26:48,752
Well, I guess he's
the head coach now.

322
00:26:49,613 --> 00:26:51,923
- You wanted to see me?
- You are Vainqueur?

323
00:26:52,716 --> 00:26:55,219
Yes. And who are you?

324
00:26:55,386 --> 00:26:58,333
I am Inspector Clouseau.
Perhaps you have heard of me.

325
00:26:58,489 --> 00:26:59,832
No.

326
00:27:00,591 --> 00:27:01,831
Don't write that down.

327
00:27:03,427 --> 00:27:06,738
- What do you want?
- I am told that Bizu hated Gluant.

328
00:27:07,031 --> 00:27:09,443
A lot of people hated Gluant.

329
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,307
Did you?

330
00:27:11,468 --> 00:27:15,211
I spent six years under his thumb
being verbally abused every day.

331
00:27:15,372 --> 00:27:17,409
Yes, I was not a fan
of Yves Gluant.

332
00:27:17,574 --> 00:27:19,383
And now he is dead...

333
00:27:19,543 --> 00:27:21,489
and you have his job.

334
00:27:21,645 --> 00:27:23,283
Ironic.

335
00:27:23,447 --> 00:27:25,449
Not every death is a tragedy.

336
00:27:25,616 --> 00:27:29,860
- And what was the...?
- Footsteps.

337
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,590
It's a young woman...

338
00:27:31,755 --> 00:27:33,894
30 to 35 years old...

339
00:27:34,058 --> 00:27:37,232
5'2", 5'4", brunette.

340
00:27:37,394 --> 00:27:39,670
And she is wearing high heels.

341
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:42,936
Perhaps a bit too formal
for the afternoon.

342
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,137
And she has on...

343
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:48,210
Chanel N°5.

344
00:27:54,511 --> 00:27:56,923
- Is anyone with you?
- No.

345
00:27:57,281 --> 00:27:59,727
Do you have a pair of high heels
in that bag?

346
00:27:59,883 --> 00:28:02,864
- No.
- Not even a small pair of pumps?

347
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,466
- No.
- Who are you?

348
00:28:05,622 --> 00:28:07,693
I am Yuri, the trainer.

349
00:28:07,858 --> 00:28:10,566
And what is it you do here,
Yuri the trainer?

350
00:28:11,595 --> 00:28:12,835
I train.

351
00:28:12,997 --> 00:28:15,841
So you are Yuri the trainer
who trains.

352
00:28:20,804 --> 00:28:22,147
Do not leave Europe.

353
00:28:23,073 --> 00:28:24,882
But I have to go to Asia.

354
00:28:25,576 --> 00:28:26,987
Okay.

355
00:28:27,144 --> 00:28:28,748
Do not leave Europe or Asia.

356
00:28:30,381 --> 00:28:33,021
We have one match in Brazil.

357
00:28:33,183 --> 00:28:34,457
All right.

358
00:28:34,618 --> 00:28:38,031
Do not leave Europe, Asia
or the Americas.

359
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:42,899
- Okay.
- Where is this famous soccer player?

360
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:46,007
He is outside on the practice field.

361
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:49,743
Well, we shall see about Mr. Bizu.

362
00:28:58,709 --> 00:29:00,814
I've got Bizu
in the interrogation room.

363
00:29:00,978 --> 00:29:02,013
What's the plan?

364
00:29:02,179 --> 00:29:05,524
I'm going to give him the
good-cop bad-cop routine.

365
00:29:07,284 --> 00:29:09,230
You are the soccer player
known as Bizu?

366
00:29:09,386 --> 00:29:12,128
- Yes.
- You were acquainted with Gluant?

367
00:29:12,756 --> 00:29:16,932
- I'm glad he's pushing up daisies.
- He is not pushing up daisies.

368
00:29:17,094 --> 00:29:18,437
He is dead.

369
00:29:19,396 --> 00:29:20,636
It's an idiom.

370
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:24,371
You, sir, are the idiom.

371
00:29:24,535 --> 00:29:27,778
Now, unless you want to spend
the rest of your life in prison...

372
00:29:27,938 --> 00:29:31,317
You will answer the next question.
Did you kill him?

373
00:29:31,809 --> 00:29:34,551
I would have loved
to have killed him.

374
00:29:35,813 --> 00:29:38,692
But some lucky bastard
beat me to it.

375
00:29:39,416 --> 00:29:41,919
You disgust me.

376
00:29:42,286 --> 00:29:44,527
I'll be right back.

377
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,800
Cigarette?

378
00:29:51,895 --> 00:29:53,465
No.

379
00:29:53,831 --> 00:29:54,866
Thanks.

380
00:29:55,365 --> 00:29:56,935
Good for you.

381
00:29:59,036 --> 00:30:00,674
Bizu...

382
00:30:03,841 --> 00:30:05,343
I know you didn't do it.

383
00:30:05,509 --> 00:30:08,080
Someone else did,
and they are trying to set you up.

384
00:30:08,612 --> 00:30:09,852
You'll help me?

385
00:30:10,414 --> 00:30:12,257
Of course I'll help you.

386
00:30:12,416 --> 00:30:16,489
Now, do you have any idea who
might have done this terrible thing?

387
00:30:16,653 --> 00:30:20,260
His partner in those
stupid restaurants, Larocque.

388
00:30:20,757 --> 00:30:23,567
Raymond Larocque,
the casino owner.

389
00:30:23,727 --> 00:30:26,731
Gluant would steal money from
the restaurants and use it to gamble.

390
00:30:27,064 --> 00:30:29,442
My guess is Larocque got fed up...

391
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,236
and had him killed.

392
00:30:31,401 --> 00:30:34,007
Bizu, I like you.

393
00:30:34,171 --> 00:30:36,117
I'm going to help you.

394
00:30:36,273 --> 00:30:39,516
You and I are going to make
a great team.

395
00:30:46,116 --> 00:30:48,892
The good-cop bad-cop routine
is working perfectly.

396
00:30:49,052 --> 00:30:52,431
You know, usually
two different cops do that.

397
00:31:11,808 --> 00:31:16,188
You know what we do to prisoners
who don't cooperate?

398
00:31:16,346 --> 00:31:18,519
We hook them up to the box.

399
00:31:20,551 --> 00:31:22,827
What is the box?

400
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,366
Idiot. Like this,
I take one electrode...

401
00:31:27,524 --> 00:31:29,470
I put it here.

402
00:31:31,395 --> 00:31:33,705
I take the other one...

403
00:31:33,864 --> 00:31:35,104
I put it...

404
00:31:48,445 --> 00:31:50,857
So, what do you think?

405
00:31:51,014 --> 00:31:53,085
Bizu is innocent.

406
00:31:53,517 --> 00:31:55,258
How can you say that?

407
00:31:55,419 --> 00:31:58,229
Gluant suspended Bizu.
He stole his girlfriend.

408
00:31:58,755 --> 00:32:02,703
If it were me, I would have killed him
then and there.

409
00:32:02,859 --> 00:32:04,668
That's exactly what Bizu did.

410
00:32:04,828 --> 00:32:06,432
Ponton...

411
00:32:06,597 --> 00:32:08,508
a crime is like a jigsaw puzzle.

412
00:32:08,665 --> 00:32:11,111
You have to have the jig
and you have to have the saw.

413
00:32:11,268 --> 00:32:13,077
You have the jig, but no saw.

414
00:32:13,237 --> 00:32:14,944
Where is your saw?

415
00:32:15,105 --> 00:32:18,382
Oh, Your Honor, I want to present
a case, but all I have is a jig.

416
00:32:18,542 --> 00:32:19,782
Is that okay?

417
00:32:23,714 --> 00:32:25,193
What?

418
00:32:25,616 --> 00:32:26,856
Nothing.

419
00:32:27,017 --> 00:32:28,496
I thought you said...

420
00:32:31,421 --> 00:32:32,832
No.

421
00:32:41,565 --> 00:32:43,511
Strange.

422
00:32:58,548 --> 00:33:00,585
Oh, it's you.

423
00:34:10,854 --> 00:34:13,460
I hope you don't mind I let
myself in with the spare key.

424
00:34:13,623 --> 00:34:16,229
- Oh, no, no.
- And, look.

425
00:34:17,994 --> 00:34:19,996
I got your pants back from the tailor.

426
00:34:20,163 --> 00:34:22,803
- Plus a spare.
- Good.

427
00:34:22,966 --> 00:34:25,845
- Would you like some water?
- Yes, please.

428
00:34:27,904 --> 00:34:33,411
You know, Nicole, this crime
is forcing me to use all my knowledge.

429
00:34:33,577 --> 00:34:37,923
Everything I have learned in a lifetime
of investigating is coming into play.

430
00:34:38,515 --> 00:34:41,189
Do you mind if I have these?
I haven't eaten.

431
00:34:41,351 --> 00:34:43,331
Oh, please, go ahead.

432
00:34:43,487 --> 00:34:47,993
Things are appearing in my mind
that I did not even realize was there.

433
00:34:48,158 --> 00:34:49,660
And yet the in...

434
00:34:49,826 --> 00:34:52,466
Oh, my God. The Heimlich!
The Heimlich!

435
00:35:10,414 --> 00:35:12,451
Are you feeling better?

436
00:35:12,949 --> 00:35:14,690
Yes, thank you.
You are so good at it.

437
00:35:14,851 --> 00:35:16,091
Where did you learn that?

438
00:35:16,253 --> 00:35:18,995
I used to practice on mannequins,
pillows...

439
00:35:19,156 --> 00:35:21,534
but frankly, it was the expression
on your face...

440
00:35:21,691 --> 00:35:23,568
that told me that you needed it.

441
00:35:23,727 --> 00:35:26,367
Now, Ponton, what do you
have for me?

442
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:30,535
It seems you were right about Bizu.
He was just found dead...

443
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,010
in the training facility locker room.

444
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:35,844
- Shot in the head.
- Was it fatal?

445
00:35:36,006 --> 00:35:38,247
- Yes.
- How fatal?

446
00:35:39,142 --> 00:35:40,382
Completely.

447
00:35:40,744 --> 00:35:42,189
I want to talk to him now.

448
00:35:42,612 --> 00:35:44,148
He's dead.

449
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,997
You there. Halt.

450
00:35:54,357 --> 00:35:56,428
You are Yuri the trainer
who trains.

451
00:35:56,593 --> 00:35:57,936
Yeah, that's right.

452
00:35:58,094 --> 00:36:01,598
I am looking for a dead body.
Perhaps you can tell me where it is.

453
00:36:01,765 --> 00:36:04,439
Oh, yeah. I heard it was
in the locker room.

454
00:36:04,601 --> 00:36:08,515
You go down the hall,
make a right and two lefts.

455
00:36:11,775 --> 00:36:14,051
You are finding
something amusing here?

456
00:36:14,211 --> 00:36:15,849
I'll be honest with you. I...

457
00:36:16,012 --> 00:36:18,151
I find your accent quite funny.

458
00:36:18,315 --> 00:36:20,886
- Where are you from?
- From Russia.

459
00:36:21,418 --> 00:36:24,627
Gluant recruited me
from the Russian military gym.

460
00:36:27,157 --> 00:36:28,602
You need to work on your accent.

461
00:36:29,025 --> 00:36:30,470
- What?
- What?

462
00:36:30,927 --> 00:36:32,600
- What? What?
- What?

463
00:36:32,762 --> 00:36:34,435
- What?
- I don't have time for this.

464
00:36:34,598 --> 00:36:35,872
I have to solve a murder.

465
00:36:40,036 --> 00:36:42,312
Please, tell me what you saw.

466
00:36:42,472 --> 00:36:45,248
Well, I didn't see anything.

467
00:36:45,742 --> 00:36:47,619
I was passing by the locker room.

468
00:36:47,777 --> 00:36:50,553
It was late, past time
anyone should be there.

469
00:36:50,714 --> 00:36:53,820
I heard movement on the other side
of the locker-room door.

470
00:36:53,984 --> 00:36:56,362
I heard Bizu say...

471
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:59,763
Oh, it's you.

472
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:02,864
And then there was gunfire.

473
00:37:03,026 --> 00:37:05,700
Ponton, go to your databases.

474
00:37:05,862 --> 00:37:10,504
I want to interrogate every person
in Paris with the name "You".

475
00:37:11,601 --> 00:37:13,046
And, Ponton...

476
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,572
don't you find it
a bit of a coincidence...

477
00:37:15,739 --> 00:37:19,983
that the body fell perfectly
within the chalk outline on the floor?

478
00:37:20,477 --> 00:37:23,788
I think they drew
the chalk outline later.

479
00:37:24,314 --> 00:37:27,818
We are dealing
with some kind of mastermind.

480
00:37:27,984 --> 00:37:31,864
Ponton, I want to interrogate
this man Raymond Larocque.

481
00:37:32,022 --> 00:37:33,695
Where is his casino?

482
00:37:45,001 --> 00:37:49,108
Park it close by. Unless you want
to know what else is good for you.

483
00:37:50,373 --> 00:37:52,182
You continue to surprise me,
inspector.

484
00:37:52,342 --> 00:37:57,189
Get used to it, Ponton. With me,
surprises are rarely unexpected.

485
00:38:00,183 --> 00:38:04,097
Yes, the weather is nice today.
Let's hope it continues.

486
00:38:04,254 --> 00:38:06,530
Ponton, go find security.

487
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:10,160
Tell them I want to converse
with Mr. Raymond Larocque.

488
00:38:10,327 --> 00:38:13,797
- You're not coming?
- Something has come up.

489
00:38:13,964 --> 00:38:18,572
If the weather stays this mild,
we are all in for a treat.

490
00:38:18,735 --> 00:38:23,411
- Place your bets.
- I am in law enforcement too.

491
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,114
Am I that obvious?

492
00:38:25,275 --> 00:38:29,690
No, it's just that I have an ear
for such things.

493
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,219
Here is your mojito.

494
00:38:32,649 --> 00:38:35,357
- Flame it.
- No more bets.

495
00:38:39,589 --> 00:38:41,125
Impressive.

496
00:38:41,291 --> 00:38:43,498
I will remember that.

497
00:38:44,527 --> 00:38:48,407
I am Inspector Jacques Clouseau.
I am here on a very important case.

498
00:38:48,565 --> 00:38:51,512
Boswell. Nigel Boswell.
Agent 006.

499
00:38:51,668 --> 00:38:53,670
- Know what that means?
- Of course I do.

500
00:38:53,837 --> 00:38:55,407
You are one short of the big time.

501
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,345
I, too, am on a very important case,
inspector.

502
00:38:59,509 --> 00:39:01,614
So you understand
what I mean when I say...

503
00:39:01,778 --> 00:39:04,088
no one must know that I am here.

504
00:39:04,247 --> 00:39:06,887
I have just slipped my
cell-phone number into your pocket.

505
00:39:09,052 --> 00:39:10,554
Call me if you need any help.

506
00:39:11,321 --> 00:39:13,528
I will, inspector.

507
00:39:25,235 --> 00:39:26,475
Well...

508
00:39:26,636 --> 00:39:29,515
Monet. Very impressive,
Monsieur Larocque.

509
00:39:29,673 --> 00:39:31,243
Very impressive,
Inspector Clouseau.

510
00:39:31,408 --> 00:39:33,820
Please make yourself at home.
Now, how can I help you?

511
00:39:33,977 --> 00:39:37,049
I am investigating the murder
of Yves Gluant.

512
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,918
Yves.

513
00:39:39,315 --> 00:39:40,919
Fascinating man.

514
00:39:41,084 --> 00:39:44,793
Would you happen to know
what he paid for the Pink Panther?

515
00:39:44,954 --> 00:39:47,161
He inherited it.
It cost him nothing.

516
00:39:47,624 --> 00:39:49,297
It cost him his life.

517
00:39:51,828 --> 00:39:54,331
I would like to take a closer look
at your bowls.

518
00:39:55,231 --> 00:39:58,007
- My what?
- Your bowls.

519
00:39:58,168 --> 00:39:59,841
I would like to take a closer look...

520
00:40:00,003 --> 00:40:02,313
at your big brass bowls.

521
00:40:06,042 --> 00:40:08,682
- Okay.
- Thank you.

522
00:40:11,081 --> 00:40:12,617
Han Dynasty.

523
00:40:12,782 --> 00:40:15,558
- Very rare. Beautiful.
- I see you have an eye for antiques.

524
00:40:15,752 --> 00:40:18,460
Some here are real
and some are copies.

525
00:40:18,655 --> 00:40:20,328
I'm sure you can tell
which are which.

526
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:23,232
Second century. Very rare.

527
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,832
One should always handle
an antique vase from the inside.

528
00:40:26,996 --> 00:40:31,138
Otherwise the oil from the hands
can damage the patina.

529
00:40:32,502 --> 00:40:34,448
Pure alabaster.

530
00:40:34,604 --> 00:40:36,174
Lovely.

531
00:40:42,312 --> 00:40:46,454
That's odd. What I did,
I went like this, and then...

532
00:40:53,923 --> 00:40:56,403
This is weird.

533
00:40:59,395 --> 00:41:02,399
Why did you take out
a life-insurance policy on Gluant?

534
00:41:02,565 --> 00:41:06,342
The insurance company won't pay
unless the murderer is caught.

535
00:41:06,503 --> 00:41:08,847
And if it turns out to be me...

536
00:41:09,005 --> 00:41:11,315
they won't pay at all.
Do you understand?

537
00:41:11,975 --> 00:41:14,956
But you stood to gain
from Gluant's death, didn't you?

538
00:41:15,111 --> 00:41:17,421
Gain? What would I gain?

539
00:41:17,881 --> 00:41:20,384
Gluant's share of the restaurants.

540
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:22,689
Oh, the restaurants
were a disaster.

541
00:41:23,253 --> 00:41:26,291
Gluant was siphoning money out
faster than it came in.

542
00:41:26,456 --> 00:41:30,063
My only consolation was he'd lose
the money gambling in my casino.

543
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:33,100
But after a while his losses
became so ridiculous...

544
00:41:33,263 --> 00:41:35,903
he promised me his ring
as collateral.

545
00:41:36,733 --> 00:41:39,043
But someone had words
with Gluant...

546
00:41:39,202 --> 00:41:40,806
the night before he was killed.

547
00:41:41,271 --> 00:41:43,842
- Didn't you?
- No.

548
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:48,584
You didn't threaten to break his legs
and then crush him into powder?

549
00:41:48,978 --> 00:41:50,218
No.

550
00:41:51,347 --> 00:41:53,190
Perhaps I saw that on TV.

551
00:41:58,087 --> 00:42:01,364
Well, I can certainly think
of a better place for this.

552
00:42:05,862 --> 00:42:08,570
That's my personalized
cell-phone tone ring.

553
00:42:15,171 --> 00:42:16,479
Hello?

554
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:18,141
Yes, this is Inspector...

555
00:42:18,608 --> 00:42:21,020
Yes, I could meet you.
In the restaurant?

556
00:42:21,711 --> 00:42:23,247
Yes, of course. Right away.

557
00:42:23,413 --> 00:42:27,020
Gentlemen, something has come up.
Please excuse me.

558
00:42:27,183 --> 00:42:28,457
- Monsieur Larocque.
- Yes.

559
00:42:28,618 --> 00:42:30,029
Is this vase of great value?

560
00:42:30,386 --> 00:42:32,263
It is a worthless imitation.

561
00:42:32,422 --> 00:42:33,992
Good.

562
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:38,732
But that desk was...

563
00:42:38,895 --> 00:42:40,135
priceless.

564
00:42:46,502 --> 00:42:48,175
- Clouseau.
- Oh, yes.

565
00:42:48,338 --> 00:42:51,285
I need your help. Now, it's very
important that you remain calm.

566
00:42:51,441 --> 00:42:54,354
- And you do not turn around.
- Remain calm. Do not turn around.

567
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:56,820
Behind you in the casino
are the Gas Mask Bandits.

568
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,120
Oh, my God!
The Gas Mask Bandits!

569
00:43:01,084 --> 00:43:03,223
- All Europe is looking for them.
- How can I help?

570
00:43:03,386 --> 00:43:06,265
- Just give me your coat.
- Yes, of course. Why?

571
00:43:06,422 --> 00:43:07,992
I'm not supposed to be here.

572
00:43:08,157 --> 00:43:10,535
But I can't let
the Gas Mask Bandits escape.

573
00:43:49,933 --> 00:43:53,176
- Put it on.
- Yes. Yes, of course. But why?

574
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:56,480
I'm not supposed to be here,
remember?

575
00:43:58,041 --> 00:43:59,520
Inspector.

576
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:03,183
My God, man, that was fantastic.

577
00:44:10,586 --> 00:44:13,692
Inspector, was Clouseau's plan to set
a trap for the Gas Mask Bandits?

578
00:44:13,856 --> 00:44:16,837
Does Clouseau think the Bandits
are connected to the Pink Panther?

579
00:44:16,993 --> 00:44:18,734
Is Clouseau
going to be promoted, sir?

580
00:44:18,895 --> 00:44:23,139
I cannot comment
on ongoing investigations.

581
00:44:23,299 --> 00:44:24,539
Drive.

582
00:44:26,336 --> 00:44:27,974
Inspector?

583
00:44:28,371 --> 00:44:29,611
Clouseau?

584
00:44:33,476 --> 00:44:34,887
Good one.

585
00:44:35,044 --> 00:44:36,546
Thank you.

586
00:44:36,713 --> 00:44:38,693
Now, what do you have for me?

587
00:44:38,848 --> 00:44:40,953
We have rounded up
all the people in Paris...

588
00:44:41,117 --> 00:44:45,065
- with the name "You".
- Finally, we are getting somewhere.

589
00:44:59,769 --> 00:45:01,578
Read that back.

590
00:45:06,042 --> 00:45:07,715
You may go.

591
00:45:09,979 --> 00:45:10,980
You speak Chinese?

592
00:45:11,614 --> 00:45:13,457
What, you don't think
I speak Chinese?

593
00:45:14,117 --> 00:45:16,290
If I don't speak Chinese,
what are we doing here?

594
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:18,599
That must be funny
around the water cooler.

595
00:45:18,755 --> 00:45:20,860
Oh, Inspector Clouseau
does not speak Chinese.

596
00:45:21,024 --> 00:45:23,504
Let's take him out for lunch.
We will all speak Chinese.

597
00:45:23,659 --> 00:45:25,468
He won't know
what we are talking about.

598
00:45:25,628 --> 00:45:28,165
Is that what you like to do?
Is that funny?

599
00:45:28,331 --> 00:45:30,607
Of course I speak Chinese.

600
00:45:35,938 --> 00:45:37,645
Clouseau?

601
00:46:04,801 --> 00:46:06,610
Bonjour, Nicole.

602
00:46:06,969 --> 00:46:09,279
Could I see you in my office
in a few minutes?

603
00:46:09,439 --> 00:46:12,420
I'll be right with you, inspector.

604
00:46:40,103 --> 00:46:41,343
Yes, inspector?

605
00:46:42,138 --> 00:46:43,378
Nicole.

606
00:46:43,539 --> 00:46:46,850
The weather has been so pleasant.

607
00:46:47,009 --> 00:46:52,152
I was wondering if you think
it's going to stay this mild.

608
00:46:53,316 --> 00:46:56,160
I certainly hope so.

609
00:46:57,687 --> 00:47:00,600
But do you think the weather...

610
00:47:00,756 --> 00:47:03,327
is going to change?

611
00:47:03,826 --> 00:47:05,999
Let's keep our fingers crossed...

612
00:47:06,162 --> 00:47:08,733
that it stays this mild.

613
00:47:09,999 --> 00:47:12,309
And here's another one for you!

614
00:47:14,036 --> 00:47:15,777
Now let's see who you are.

615
00:47:17,673 --> 00:47:20,119
It is Inspector Dreyfus.

616
00:47:20,276 --> 00:47:22,916
The intruder is obviously wearing
a flesh mask.

617
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:24,581
But that will come off.

618
00:47:26,449 --> 00:47:28,451
My face!

619
00:47:33,022 --> 00:47:35,195
Maybe there is a seam
under your hairline.

620
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:37,269
I'll just turn you around.

621
00:47:44,367 --> 00:47:47,541
Are you feeling any better?
I am so sorry, inspector.

622
00:47:48,337 --> 00:47:50,112
Let's just forget it.

623
00:47:50,273 --> 00:47:53,686
I thought I would stop by and let you
know how we are doing on the case.

624
00:47:53,843 --> 00:47:56,221
Oh, I'll just...

625
00:47:56,379 --> 00:47:59,588
- stay back here.
- Yes, of course.

626
00:48:00,082 --> 00:48:03,029
I see you have one
of these collapsible pointers.

627
00:48:03,186 --> 00:48:04,426
So very useful.

628
00:48:04,587 --> 00:48:07,431
It is so degrading to have to point
with your finger...

629
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:09,763
or one of those
long wooden sticks...

630
00:48:09,926 --> 00:48:12,736
like you are some sort
of primitive oaf.

631
00:48:12,895 --> 00:48:17,935
But you have one of these, you just
snap it open and you are ready to go.

632
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:19,943
The case. The case, Clouseau.

633
00:48:20,269 --> 00:48:22,476
Yes, the case.

634
00:48:22,638 --> 00:48:26,643
The case is going quite well.
I have prepared a list of suspects.

635
00:48:27,643 --> 00:48:29,782
And how many suspects
do you have?

636
00:48:30,313 --> 00:48:32,793
Twenty-seven thousand
six hundred eighty-three.

637
00:48:33,716 --> 00:48:36,754
It's just a matter of time now,
isn't it?

638
00:48:36,919 --> 00:48:40,298
- Have you eliminated any suspects?
- Yes.

639
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:42,164
One.

640
00:48:42,725 --> 00:48:44,830
One. And who would that be?

641
00:48:45,795 --> 00:48:47,035
Gluant.

642
00:48:48,231 --> 00:48:50,472
Gluant is the victim.

643
00:48:51,067 --> 00:48:53,308
Excellent, inspector.

644
00:48:53,469 --> 00:48:55,449
We think alike.

645
00:48:55,972 --> 00:49:00,284
One clue leading inexorably
to the next.

646
00:49:02,345 --> 00:49:03,585
Just leave it.

647
00:49:05,915 --> 00:49:07,394
I assure you, inspector...

648
00:49:07,783 --> 00:49:11,196
I will soon have your criminal
cornered like a...

649
00:49:11,354 --> 00:49:13,857
like a, like... like a, like...

650
00:49:14,023 --> 00:49:17,095
like something...
something that you... you corner.

651
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:20,600
- Well put.
- I see you enjoy wordplay.

652
00:49:20,763 --> 00:49:22,470
We will have to have lunch
one day...

653
00:49:22,632 --> 00:49:25,875
and engage
in a little verbal jousting.

654
00:49:26,535 --> 00:49:29,015
I'm sure you're quite the raconteur.

655
00:49:31,907 --> 00:49:33,215
Yes.

656
00:49:34,744 --> 00:49:37,350
So I will call you for lunch.

657
00:49:41,317 --> 00:49:44,230
There's only one item
on the agenda of this committee.

658
00:49:44,887 --> 00:49:49,029
To approve the list of nominees
for our nation's highest award.

659
00:49:49,191 --> 00:49:50,670
The Medal of Honor.

660
00:49:50,826 --> 00:49:53,170
The two nominees are...

661
00:49:53,629 --> 00:49:54,937
Charles Dreyfus...

662
00:49:57,566 --> 00:49:58,909
No.

663
00:50:00,636 --> 00:50:02,843
And Sister Marie-Hugette...

664
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:06,752
whose selfless concern
for our nation's orphans...

665
00:50:06,909 --> 00:50:09,321
is an inspiration to us all.

666
00:50:09,478 --> 00:50:12,891
I would like to add one more name
for the committee's consideration.

667
00:50:13,049 --> 00:50:16,553
Inspector Jacques Clouseau, the man
who came here from a small village...

668
00:50:16,719 --> 00:50:18,824
to investigate the murder
of Yves Gluant...

669
00:50:18,988 --> 00:50:22,231
who just last night captured
the notorious Gas Mask Bandits.

670
00:50:22,391 --> 00:50:25,372
Yes. Interesting idea.

671
00:50:26,295 --> 00:50:28,297
- An average Frenchman.
- Exactly.

672
00:50:28,464 --> 00:50:30,341
Excellent idea.

673
00:50:30,499 --> 00:50:32,740
All in favor?

674
00:50:32,902 --> 00:50:36,315
How is it I was not informed
of Clouseau's going to that casino?

675
00:50:36,472 --> 00:50:40,010
- It was the middle of the night.
- Oh, it was the middle of the night.

676
00:50:40,176 --> 00:50:42,417
What, you did not want to wake me?

677
00:50:42,578 --> 00:50:44,489
I want to know
of Clouseau's whereabouts...

678
00:50:44,647 --> 00:50:46,957
every hour, 24 hours a day.

679
00:50:47,116 --> 00:50:49,790
You miss one call, and I will have
you kicked off the force.

680
00:50:49,952 --> 00:50:52,489
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

681
00:50:52,655 --> 00:50:55,101
Why are you not with him now?

682
00:50:55,257 --> 00:50:58,602
- I'm here.
- Get out.

683
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:03,940
- Clouseau.
- Ponton.

684
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:06,512
Let's call it a day. I am tired.

685
00:51:06,669 --> 00:51:09,548
I just wanted to see where you are
with the investigation.

686
00:51:09,705 --> 00:51:12,151
Good idea, Ponton.
To let the subconscious mind...

687
00:51:12,308 --> 00:51:15,289
work on the case while we sleep.
Now then, what are the facts?

688
00:51:15,478 --> 00:51:16,752
Yves Gluant was found...

689
00:51:16,912 --> 00:51:19,222
at the international championship
semifinal...

690
00:51:19,382 --> 00:51:22,124
- with a poison dart in his neck.
- The crime!

691
00:51:22,284 --> 00:51:25,094
Bizu wanted to kill him,
but is now himself dead.

692
00:51:25,254 --> 00:51:26,733
A complication!

693
00:51:26,889 --> 00:51:28,368
Gluant was siphoning off money...

694
00:51:28,524 --> 00:51:30,265
- from Larocque.
- A motive!

695
00:51:30,426 --> 00:51:32,565
And close to the body
was the singer, Xania.

696
00:51:32,995 --> 00:51:34,406
Xania is not the killer.

697
00:51:34,563 --> 00:51:36,907
But I suspect she knows more
than she is telling me.

698
00:51:37,066 --> 00:51:39,876
- Where is she now?
- She left suddenly for New York.

699
00:51:40,035 --> 00:51:43,642
We are going to have to follow her
and find out what she is up to.

700
00:51:43,806 --> 00:51:45,251
And if I am going to America...

701
00:51:45,408 --> 00:51:48,321
I am going to have to speak
with a flawless American accent...

702
00:51:48,477 --> 00:51:50,889
so as not to arouse suspicion.

703
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,023
So find me the greatest
accent coach in the world.

704
00:51:55,484 --> 00:51:57,464
I would like to buy a hamburger.

705
00:51:57,987 --> 00:52:00,524
I would like to buy a hamburger.

706
00:52:00,723 --> 00:52:04,535
I would like to buy a hamburger.

707
00:52:04,693 --> 00:52:06,434
I would like to buy...

708
00:52:06,595 --> 00:52:09,474
a hamburger.

709
00:52:09,632 --> 00:52:11,737
No, no, no. Let's break it down.

710
00:52:11,901 --> 00:52:13,175
I...

711
00:52:13,335 --> 00:52:14,939
I...

712
00:52:15,104 --> 00:52:16,583
- Would.
- Would.

713
00:52:16,739 --> 00:52:19,845
- Would.
- Would.

714
00:52:20,676 --> 00:52:24,123
- Would.
- Weird.

715
00:52:24,613 --> 00:52:26,820
Would.

716
00:52:26,982 --> 00:52:29,155
Would.

717
00:52:29,318 --> 00:52:30,422
- Like.
- Like.

718
00:52:30,586 --> 00:52:31,997
- Like.
- Like.

719
00:52:32,154 --> 00:52:33,656
- To.
- To.

720
00:52:33,856 --> 00:52:35,631
- To.
- To.

721
00:52:36,225 --> 00:52:37,704
To.

722
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:39,835
To.

723
00:52:39,995 --> 00:52:41,269
- Buy.
- Buy.

724
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:42,500
- Buy.
- Bee.

725
00:52:42,665 --> 00:52:45,145
- Buy.
- Bye-bye.

726
00:52:45,301 --> 00:52:47,679
- A.
- A.

727
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:50,043
Hamburger.

728
00:52:50,206 --> 00:52:51,776
Hamburger.

729
00:52:51,941 --> 00:52:53,420
Hamburger.

730
00:52:54,577 --> 00:52:58,548
- Hamburger.
- Hamburger.

731
00:52:58,747 --> 00:53:01,023
I would like to buy a hamburger.

732
00:53:01,183 --> 00:53:02,753
I would like to buy a damburger.

733
00:53:03,752 --> 00:53:05,629
It's not damburger. Hamburger.

734
00:53:05,788 --> 00:53:08,894
I'm not saying damburger. I said,
I would like to buy a damburger.

735
00:53:09,091 --> 00:53:12,504
- I would like to buy a hamburger.
- I would like to buy the hamburger.

736
00:53:12,661 --> 00:53:15,267
- Hamburger.
- I would like to buy a hamburger!

737
00:53:15,431 --> 00:53:17,104
- Maybe we should stop.
- We don't quit.

738
00:53:17,266 --> 00:53:19,075
We do not quit. Again! Again!

739
00:53:19,768 --> 00:53:22,908
- I would like to buy a hamburger.
- I would like to buy a hamburger!

740
00:53:23,072 --> 00:53:26,246
- I would like to buy a hamburger.
- I would like to buy hamburger.

741
00:53:26,442 --> 00:53:28,718
- I would like to buy a hamburger.
- I would like to buy a hamburger.

742
00:53:28,878 --> 00:53:32,121
- I would like to buy a hamburger.
- I would like to buy hamburger!

743
00:53:32,281 --> 00:53:33,817
I would like to buy a hamburger.

744
00:54:05,948 --> 00:54:08,326
- Have you ever had a hamburger?
- Well, of course not.

745
00:54:08,484 --> 00:54:11,556
It's a disgusting American food.

746
00:54:44,453 --> 00:54:47,161
I never see you with women.

747
00:54:48,257 --> 00:54:49,930
I'm married.

748
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:53,633
You don't wear a ring.

749
00:54:53,796 --> 00:54:55,241
To protect her.

750
00:54:55,397 --> 00:54:57,741
I'm afraid some villain
might threaten her.

751
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,811
Yes.

752
00:54:59,969 --> 00:55:02,074
Tell me about her.

753
00:55:03,339 --> 00:55:07,310
I consider her the most
beautiful woman in the world.

754
00:55:08,811 --> 00:55:10,791
What about yourself?

755
00:55:10,946 --> 00:55:15,793
No, I don't consider myself
a beautiful woman.

756
00:55:16,085 --> 00:55:18,622
I mean, is there a woman
in your life?

757
00:55:18,787 --> 00:55:20,323
Oh, no.

758
00:55:20,489 --> 00:55:23,368
Love has not yet come my way.

759
00:55:23,525 --> 00:55:26,529
How could Inspector Clouseau
be with a simple woman?

760
00:55:26,695 --> 00:55:31,007
She would have to be
so extraordinary in order to keep up.

761
00:55:31,834 --> 00:55:33,472
It's hard.

762
00:55:37,673 --> 00:55:41,246
- What is?
- For you to meet someone.

763
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:43,790
Oh, yes.

764
00:55:44,747 --> 00:55:46,954
We have a big day tomorrow.

765
00:55:47,116 --> 00:55:51,861
We will go to Xania's hotel
and find out what she is up to.

766
00:55:52,488 --> 00:55:55,469
- Good night, Ponton.
- Good night, Clouseau.

767
00:55:56,392 --> 00:55:57,962
- Good one.
- Thank you.

768
00:56:03,699 --> 00:56:05,701
I got her hotel phone records.

769
00:56:05,868 --> 00:56:07,438
Xania made two phone calls...

770
00:56:07,603 --> 00:56:10,277
to a notorious
black-market diamond cutter.

771
00:56:10,839 --> 00:56:13,046
There she is! Newspapers!

772
00:56:18,914 --> 00:56:20,587
Newspapers!

773
00:56:23,285 --> 00:56:24,958
Newspapers!

774
00:56:26,955 --> 00:56:28,229
Newspapers!

775
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:50,447
Floor 12.

776
00:56:53,282 --> 00:56:56,229
I smell something fishy.

777
00:57:00,622 --> 00:57:02,431
May I help you?

778
00:57:16,872 --> 00:57:18,943
Good teamwork.

779
00:57:27,816 --> 00:57:31,491
Stop! Stop whatever it is
you are doing! You are defenseless!

780
00:57:31,653 --> 00:57:34,600
We have already taken care
of your thugs patrolling the building.

781
00:57:34,757 --> 00:57:36,464
I don't have any thugs.

782
00:57:36,625 --> 00:57:38,229
You don't?

783
00:57:38,694 --> 00:57:42,301
Ponton, I think we owe
those men an apology.

784
00:57:42,464 --> 00:57:44,705
And what is it you are cutting?

785
00:57:45,134 --> 00:57:47,171
Pink diamond. Clear.

786
00:57:47,369 --> 00:57:50,680
- Clear?
- It's not the Pink Panther.

787
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:54,887
And what are you doing here
sneaking around?

788
00:57:55,911 --> 00:57:58,585
This purse once belonged
to Josephine Baker.

789
00:57:58,747 --> 00:58:01,557
It was falling apart, so
I had it studded with diamonds...

790
00:58:01,717 --> 00:58:03,719
to wear on-stage
at the Presidential Ball.

791
00:58:03,919 --> 00:58:06,627
Well, why did you just not tell me
why you were coming?

792
00:58:07,222 --> 00:58:09,759
I can't be seen at a diamond cutter.

793
00:58:09,925 --> 00:58:11,802
Not after what happened.

794
00:58:14,229 --> 00:58:18,075
That may be one
of your mysterious clients now.

795
00:58:18,433 --> 00:58:19,969
Hello?

796
00:58:20,369 --> 00:58:23,907
Yes, I am the person
in charge of the phone bill.

797
00:58:24,072 --> 00:58:26,143
Well, I'm somewhat happy
with my service.

798
00:58:26,308 --> 00:58:28,345
Twelve months
with that many minutes?

799
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:30,490
Plus free minutes per month?

800
00:58:30,913 --> 00:58:33,917
Yes, sign me up.
Yes, Jacques Clouseau.

801
00:58:34,082 --> 00:58:36,460
Credit card number...

802
00:58:49,965 --> 00:58:53,708
Yes? Yes, you may have
my e-mail address.

803
00:58:54,536 --> 00:58:58,416
DoctorKnockers@aol.com.

804
00:58:59,741 --> 00:59:03,780
Well, I think I just got myself
a pretty good deal.

805
00:59:07,749 --> 00:59:11,356
- When are you leaving the city?
- I'm leaving tomorrow. Yeah.

806
00:59:12,387 --> 00:59:15,596
I may have to seduce her, Ponton,
in order to get her to talk.

807
00:59:15,757 --> 00:59:17,759
- Part of the job.
- Talk about what?

808
00:59:17,926 --> 00:59:20,839
I want to find out what time
her plane is leaving in the morning.

809
00:59:20,996 --> 00:59:23,408
- Why not just ask her?
- Too obvious.

810
00:59:23,565 --> 00:59:26,171
I may have to pump her
for information.

811
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:29,077
- I see.
- Inspector...

812
00:59:30,072 --> 00:59:33,212
would you like to join me
for dinner at the Waldorf?

813
00:59:33,775 --> 00:59:35,584
Certainly, mademoiselle.

814
00:59:35,744 --> 00:59:37,951
Say, 8:00?

815
00:59:38,547 --> 00:59:39,890
Eight o'clock.

816
00:59:40,249 --> 00:59:43,787
Say, I don't know,
my room on the second floor?

817
00:59:44,286 --> 00:59:47,495
I don't know,
my room on the second floor.

818
00:59:48,257 --> 00:59:49,634
I'll see you then.

819
00:59:52,194 --> 00:59:54,105
It might be a trap.

820
00:59:54,263 --> 00:59:56,243
Who cares?

821
01:00:14,049 --> 01:00:16,495
Welcome to my room, inspector.

822
01:00:17,619 --> 01:00:19,462
It is lovely weather we are having.

823
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:38,743
Oh, yes, baby. Oh, yes.

824
01:00:47,749 --> 01:00:49,285
Why?

825
01:00:50,152 --> 01:00:51,460
Why what?

826
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:55,432
Why were you being
so elusive today?

827
01:00:56,258 --> 01:00:58,135
I was afraid of Larocque.

828
01:00:58,293 --> 01:01:02,537
- He might be following me.
- Larocque? The casino owner?

829
01:01:02,698 --> 01:01:04,700
He sent out word
threatening to kill anyone...

830
01:01:04,866 --> 01:01:06,675
in possession
of the Pink Panther.

831
01:01:06,835 --> 01:01:08,837
He believes it belongs to him.

832
01:01:09,237 --> 01:01:10,807
But why would he follow you?

833
01:01:11,173 --> 01:01:13,915
I was in New York
to see a diamond cutter.

834
01:01:14,076 --> 01:01:15,987
He might draw
the wrong conclusion.

835
01:01:16,411 --> 01:01:17,788
You know...

836
01:01:17,946 --> 01:01:23,362
a man sitting here
in your private suite...

837
01:01:23,518 --> 01:01:25,520
so close to you...

838
01:01:25,687 --> 01:01:27,963
might draw
the wrong conclusion too.

839
01:01:28,457 --> 01:01:30,698
Or the right one.

840
01:01:31,493 --> 01:01:33,564
I've heard things
about you, inspector.

841
01:01:34,329 --> 01:01:36,172
What sort of things?

842
01:01:36,331 --> 01:01:38,777
That you really know
how to treat a woman.

843
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:48,149
Yes. Yes.

844
01:01:48,643 --> 01:01:51,487
Let the games begin.

845
01:01:52,848 --> 01:01:55,920
Let me just slip away.

846
01:02:10,198 --> 01:02:11,871
Yes!

847
01:02:17,239 --> 01:02:19,412
No! No, no! No, no!

848
01:02:20,409 --> 01:02:23,447
My miracle pill
for the middle-aged man.

849
01:02:33,855 --> 01:02:35,129
Give it back.

850
01:02:49,204 --> 01:02:50,945
Inspector?

851
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:57,280
- Are you all right in there?
- I hope you're getting yourself ready.

852
01:03:02,784 --> 01:03:04,786
Inspector? Are you sure
you're okay in there?

853
01:03:04,953 --> 01:03:08,196
Yes, I am. I'm fine.
I'm just getting in the mood for love.

854
01:03:37,519 --> 01:03:39,863
Well, hello.

855
01:03:47,829 --> 01:03:50,833
We need fresh towels in 204.

856
01:03:54,069 --> 01:03:57,346
Don't ask why, just do it.

857
01:03:57,506 --> 01:04:00,715
You have the flight number.
He leaves tomorrow out of JFK.

858
01:04:00,876 --> 01:04:05,120
He'll be easy to spot. He's got
white hair, a thin mustache...

859
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:08,921
brimming with self-confidence
and completely lost.

860
01:04:17,592 --> 01:04:19,663
- Did you get the stuff?
- Yes.

861
01:04:19,828 --> 01:04:21,239
Good.

862
01:04:21,396 --> 01:04:25,469
Give it to me.
Airline food is for suckers.

863
01:04:25,634 --> 01:04:29,343
I will smuggle this on.
Just act cool.

864
01:04:36,077 --> 01:04:38,079
- Hey, that's Xania!
- Hello.

865
01:04:38,246 --> 01:04:40,624
Hi. Yes, thank you.

866
01:04:40,782 --> 01:04:43,262
I still think she is hiding
something, Ponton.

867
01:04:43,418 --> 01:04:44,726
What?

868
01:04:44,886 --> 01:04:47,924
If I knew what she was hiding,
then it wouldn't be hidden, would it?

869
01:04:48,089 --> 01:04:50,091
- All right. Thank you.
- One more! One more!

870
01:04:50,258 --> 01:04:51,669
Okay, let's go. Next.

871
01:04:51,826 --> 01:04:53,999
Nothing to declare.

872
01:04:57,732 --> 01:05:00,906
- Come on through.
- Hand check on two.

873
01:05:02,237 --> 01:05:04,274
- This your bag, sir?
- Yes, it is.

874
01:05:04,439 --> 01:05:07,545
- We'll have to hand check it.
- Go ahead. I have nothing to hide...

875
01:05:07,709 --> 01:05:09,086
in my bag.

876
01:05:09,711 --> 01:05:11,486
Come with me, sir.

877
01:05:13,114 --> 01:05:14,855
Wait here, pal.

878
01:05:25,627 --> 01:05:28,039
It's a harmless pocketknife.

879
01:05:32,834 --> 01:05:35,337
It's a harmless pair of
numchucks?

880
01:05:39,307 --> 01:05:42,777
I don't... I don't even own a mace.
I don't know where that came from.

881
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:50,861
I've never seen that stuff in my life.

882
01:05:51,052 --> 01:05:52,725
Jimbo!

883
01:05:53,588 --> 01:05:56,000
You don't need Jimbo.

884
01:05:59,261 --> 01:06:01,537
- Jimbo, stay.
- What's in your pocket, sir?

885
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:03,710
- Nothing.
- Sir, I'll say again...

886
01:06:03,865 --> 01:06:05,936
- What's in your pocket?
- Nothing.

887
01:06:07,102 --> 01:06:10,208
I'm gonna ask you again,
what's in your pocket, sir?

888
01:06:11,273 --> 01:06:12,684
All right.

889
01:06:12,841 --> 01:06:15,515
I have, in my pocket...

890
01:06:15,677 --> 01:06:18,385
a couple of "hambwortsforts".

891
01:06:19,047 --> 01:06:20,890
What?

892
01:06:22,150 --> 01:06:25,461
I have in my pocket...

893
01:06:25,787 --> 01:06:28,267
a couple of "dolvargars".

894
01:06:28,957 --> 01:06:30,300
Sir?

895
01:06:31,126 --> 01:06:37,099
- Sir, in your pocket you have...?
- All right, I have four "hanholders".

896
01:06:37,432 --> 01:06:39,139
I'm sorry. Once more.

897
01:06:40,702 --> 01:06:41,976
Again!

898
01:06:42,137 --> 01:06:43,616
- Sir...
- Hey, what's that?

899
01:06:45,874 --> 01:06:48,582
- Sir. Sir, I'm losing my patience.
- Oh, you are?

900
01:06:48,743 --> 01:06:50,313
- You are losing your patience?
- Yes.

901
01:06:50,478 --> 01:06:53,254
I'm simply telling you I have
a couple of "tamburthers".

902
01:06:53,615 --> 01:06:57,028
I've got an End darter down on six.
I've got an End darter down on six!

903
01:06:57,185 --> 01:06:59,893
- Locked and loaded, sir!
- Show me your hands, sir!

904
01:07:00,055 --> 01:07:01,830
All right, I'll just show you.

905
01:07:02,857 --> 01:07:05,269
- No, no, no! Stay here, sir.
- Sic him, W!

906
01:07:19,474 --> 01:07:23,251
- Yes, that's him!
- Inspector, what is a "damburgert"?

907
01:07:23,411 --> 01:07:26,881
Inspector, how does it feel
to have let down the nation?

908
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:37,026
So much for the heroic
Inspector Clouseau.

909
01:07:39,127 --> 01:07:43,667
Well, this is a glorious day
for France.

910
01:07:44,232 --> 01:07:46,007
How so, chief inspector?

911
01:07:46,167 --> 01:07:48,977
Because a stupid idiot
named Clouseau...

912
01:07:49,137 --> 01:07:53,244
is going to be stripped of his rank
while I take over his case.

913
01:07:53,408 --> 01:07:55,649
You have a second man
named Clouseau?

914
01:07:55,810 --> 01:07:59,189
My God. Leave us alone
for a moment.

915
01:07:59,347 --> 01:08:02,920
You, out. Go, go. Go.
I must have a private word...

916
01:08:03,084 --> 01:08:06,031
with Inspector Clouseau.

917
01:08:06,187 --> 01:08:07,791
Understand something, Clouseau.

918
01:08:07,956 --> 01:08:11,426
When I made you an inspector,
it was not because I thought...

919
01:08:11,593 --> 01:08:13,698
you had any value as a detective.

920
01:08:13,862 --> 01:08:19,175
It was because I thought you were the
stupidest policeman in all of France.

921
01:08:19,567 --> 01:08:22,844
A hopeless, deluded idiot.

922
01:08:23,271 --> 01:08:25,649
Then I was not promoted
for my merits?

923
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:29,344
I only made you inspector
because I needed someone...

924
01:08:29,511 --> 01:08:32,048
who would quietly get
nowhere until I was ready...

925
01:08:32,213 --> 01:08:34,215
to take over the case myself.

926
01:08:34,682 --> 01:08:36,662
I was trying to catch a killer.

927
01:08:36,818 --> 01:08:39,355
You were trying...

928
01:08:40,989 --> 01:08:45,836
You were trying to become a hero.
Well, you will be stripped...

929
01:08:45,994 --> 01:08:48,565
of your rank,
ridiculed by the media...

930
01:08:48,730 --> 01:08:50,334
and I will be done with you.

931
01:08:50,498 --> 01:08:54,674
And now if you will excuse me,
ex-inspector, I must go and prepare...

932
01:08:54,836 --> 01:08:58,374
for the arrest which will win me
the Medal of Honor...

933
01:08:58,540 --> 01:09:03,614
catapult me to the National
Assembly, and after that, who knows?

934
01:09:04,245 --> 01:09:07,351
- Goodbye, Clouseau.
- Shall we lock him up?

935
01:09:07,515 --> 01:09:09,051
Look at him.

936
01:09:09,217 --> 01:09:13,324
He is finished.
Let him go home to obscurity.

937
01:09:22,797 --> 01:09:24,401
You knew?

938
01:09:47,288 --> 01:09:48,995
Ponton...

939
01:09:49,491 --> 01:09:51,767
things were not
as I supposed they were.

940
01:09:53,061 --> 01:09:56,702
And if I ever made
you look foolish...

941
01:09:57,265 --> 01:09:59,472
I am sorry.

942
01:10:00,702 --> 01:10:04,411
It was an honor
serving under you, sir.

943
01:10:16,417 --> 01:10:18,192
Good one.

944
01:10:41,976 --> 01:10:43,853
The Internet.

945
01:10:44,012 --> 01:10:45,821
Hello, old friend.

946
01:10:48,583 --> 01:10:52,156
To download your new
cell-phone ringtone...

947
01:10:52,587 --> 01:10:56,501
press the button
that says download.

948
01:10:57,091 --> 01:11:01,938
I take the mouse and I click,
but do not drag...

949
01:11:02,096 --> 01:11:06,044
the button that says download.

950
01:11:16,544 --> 01:11:19,150
Gentlemen, and lady,
good morning.

951
01:11:19,314 --> 01:11:22,386
Meet Dr. Li How Pang.

952
01:11:22,550 --> 01:11:25,793
He was, of course, in the VIP box
when Gluant was killed.

953
01:11:25,954 --> 01:11:29,834
Coincidentally, Dr. Pang would
send Gluant large sums of money.

954
01:11:29,991 --> 01:11:34,371
Presumably, Gluant was to invest
these sums on Pang's behalf.

955
01:11:34,529 --> 01:11:38,477
But being a compulsive gambler,
Gluant took the money...

956
01:11:38,633 --> 01:11:40,977
and gambled it all away.

957
01:11:41,569 --> 01:11:43,981
So Pang had the motive.

958
01:11:44,372 --> 01:11:47,148
He had the opportunity.

959
01:11:47,308 --> 01:11:51,950
Pang is in France
for the president's ball tonight.

960
01:11:52,113 --> 01:11:55,959
We will arrest him there
for the murder of Yves Gluant.

961
01:11:56,117 --> 01:11:58,222
Bravo, chief inspector.

962
01:11:59,053 --> 01:12:02,057
I am pleased to announce that
I am personally taking over...

963
01:12:02,223 --> 01:12:06,433
the Pink Panther investigation
and that an arrest is imminent.

964
01:12:06,594 --> 01:12:08,369
- Thank you.
- Chief inspector...

965
01:12:08,529 --> 01:12:10,839
the coroner has announced
that Bizu was killed...

966
01:12:10,999 --> 01:12:14,378
with a perfect shot to the
occipital lobe. Any comments?

967
01:12:14,535 --> 01:12:16,947
The occipital lobe?

968
01:12:17,872 --> 01:12:19,852
It's irrelevant.

969
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:25,156
The occipital lobe.

970
01:12:39,227 --> 01:12:41,400
That makes me feel good.

971
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:51,047
Zoom.

972
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:02,124
Of course.

973
01:13:06,921 --> 01:13:09,299
Ponton, I need you
over here immediately.

974
01:13:09,457 --> 01:13:12,267
We are back on the case.

975
01:13:15,630 --> 01:13:19,703
Nicole, I believe Bizu and Gluant
were killed by the same person.

976
01:13:19,867 --> 01:13:22,177
And that the killer
will strike again tonight.

977
01:13:22,336 --> 01:13:24,873
I want you to meet me
at the presidential palace.

978
01:13:25,039 --> 01:13:28,213
And bring my vinyl bag marked
presidential palace.

979
01:13:28,376 --> 01:13:32,688
And hurry! Xania is in grave danger.

980
01:13:34,449 --> 01:13:38,488
Ponton, we must get to the
presidential palace immediately!

981
01:13:38,653 --> 01:13:40,997
- Put your seat belt on.
- I don't need a seat belt.

982
01:13:41,155 --> 01:13:42,759
Let's see what this baby can do!

983
01:13:51,065 --> 01:13:53,807
No. Clouseau should not
be on this list.

984
01:13:53,968 --> 01:13:56,710
He is no longer allowed
at state affairs.

985
01:13:56,871 --> 01:14:00,444
He has been disgraced
and humiliated.

986
01:14:00,608 --> 01:14:03,680
But what about all the reporters
who will want to come in?

987
01:14:03,845 --> 01:14:07,987
When the time is right,
let them pour in.

988
01:14:27,969 --> 01:14:29,846
Clouseau.

989
01:14:31,639 --> 01:14:33,744
I'm sorry, but your name
is not on the list.

990
01:14:33,908 --> 01:14:35,649
Not on the list?

991
01:14:36,778 --> 01:14:39,054
Dreyfus must have made sure
you cannot get in.

992
01:14:45,219 --> 01:14:46,596
Ponton.

993
01:14:52,226 --> 01:14:55,036
- Inspector, here is your bag.
- Good work, Nicole.

994
01:14:55,196 --> 01:14:58,405
- What is that?
- Camouflage. Let's go.

995
01:14:58,566 --> 01:15:00,239
- Nicole.
- Yes?

996
01:15:00,401 --> 01:15:02,677
- One last thing.
- Yes?

997
01:15:08,810 --> 01:15:10,289
It's evening...

998
01:15:10,444 --> 01:15:13,323
and you look beautiful
without your glasses.

999
01:15:42,650 --> 01:15:43,890
- Chief inspector.
- What?

1000
01:15:44,546 --> 01:15:48,517
Our men have reported a sighting
of Inspector Clouseau.

1001
01:15:48,684 --> 01:15:50,095
Clouseau?

1002
01:15:50,786 --> 01:15:55,428
I know what he's up to. He wants
to try to make the arrest himself.

1003
01:15:55,590 --> 01:15:59,834
If you see Clouseau,
put him in cuffs for trespassing...

1004
01:15:59,995 --> 01:16:02,066
and parade him through the party.

1005
01:16:02,230 --> 01:16:05,905
I want all men on alert.
Arrest him outside.

1006
01:16:11,450 --> 01:16:14,363
Dr. Pang has arrived.

1007
01:16:17,056 --> 01:16:20,333
We will take him after the first song.

1008
01:16:21,227 --> 01:16:22,797
Yes, yes. Very true.

1009
01:17:36,068 --> 01:17:38,605
Good work, Ponton. We're in.

1010
01:17:40,272 --> 01:17:42,081
Look!

1011
01:17:42,942 --> 01:17:45,115
It's the killer! After him!

1012
01:17:45,277 --> 01:17:50,283
- Change outfits.
- Stop! Turn around.

1013
01:17:50,449 --> 01:17:51,757
Who are you?

1014
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:56,957
- What are you doing here?
- We are, we are two, we are...

1015
01:17:57,122 --> 01:17:59,193
- I'll tell you exactly who we are.
- Yes.

1016
01:17:59,358 --> 01:18:01,599
- We are...
- I've been looking for you everywhere.

1017
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,603
Where the hell have you been?

1018
01:18:03,762 --> 01:18:06,265
- You know these two?
- Of course I know them.

1019
01:18:06,465 --> 01:18:09,708
They are Xania's backup dancers.
They go on in the third act...

1020
01:18:09,868 --> 01:18:11,939
with the Komodo dragon
and the snow machine.

1021
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:14,448
Why do you think they are
dressed like that, for fun?

1022
01:18:14,607 --> 01:18:17,144
- Prove it.
- We don't have to prove...

1023
01:18:54,847 --> 01:18:56,724
Can't you see these dancers
are exhausted?

1024
01:18:56,882 --> 01:18:58,259
Go and fetch them some water.

1025
01:19:00,486 --> 01:19:02,466
That was fantastic.

1026
01:19:02,888 --> 01:19:04,561
- You think so?
- You are...

1027
01:19:06,125 --> 01:19:08,696
an amazing woman.

1028
01:19:13,098 --> 01:19:15,840
Inspector, the killer.

1029
01:19:30,049 --> 01:19:33,428
Now I am ready to catch a killer.

1030
01:19:48,967 --> 01:19:50,037
Stop!

1031
01:19:50,469 --> 01:19:52,745
Stop in the name of the law.

1032
01:19:53,472 --> 01:19:54,951
Get him!

1033
01:19:55,474 --> 01:19:57,784
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

1034
01:19:59,912 --> 01:20:03,189
Ponton, you follow him that way.
I'll go this way and cut him off.

1035
01:20:06,185 --> 01:20:07,425
Stop!

1036
01:20:09,488 --> 01:20:11,126
Turn around.

1037
01:20:12,124 --> 01:20:14,934
- You're under arre...
- You are under arrest!

1038
01:20:15,094 --> 01:20:17,074
Ponton! After him!

1039
01:20:17,396 --> 01:20:18,807
Now.

1040
01:20:19,665 --> 01:20:20,735
Go, go!

1041
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:24,604
Well, Dr. Pang.
In the name of the statutes...

1042
01:20:25,003 --> 01:20:27,483
and laws of the great nation
of France...

1043
01:20:29,108 --> 01:20:32,817
I arrest you for the murder
of Yves Gluant.

1044
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:39,460
Clouseau! Arrest him.

1045
01:20:41,153 --> 01:20:42,791
Which one is he?

1046
01:20:42,955 --> 01:20:44,229
That would be him.

1047
01:20:48,594 --> 01:20:52,474
In the name of the statutes and laws
of the great nation of France...

1048
01:20:52,631 --> 01:20:54,907
I arrest you for the murder
of Yves Gluant.

1049
01:20:55,067 --> 01:20:57,445
Yuri, the trainer who trains.

1050
01:20:59,772 --> 01:21:01,479
And who are you?

1051
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:04,484
I am Inspector Jacques Clouseau.

1052
01:21:05,344 --> 01:21:07,517
Gluant was nothing!

1053
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:09,283
I drew up the plays.

1054
01:21:09,815 --> 01:21:13,353
He takes credit for brilliant
French defense which I gave him...

1055
01:21:13,519 --> 01:21:17,661
and treats me like I'm dead. Fine.
Now he is dead from Chinese poison.

1056
01:21:19,024 --> 01:21:21,971
Inspector, what made you
think it was him?

1057
01:21:22,127 --> 01:21:27,338
But, Ponton, think back.
You were there.

1058
01:21:28,934 --> 01:21:30,004
Why do you bother me?

1059
01:21:30,169 --> 01:21:31,807
Why did you bring me here?
I'm busy.

1060
01:21:33,005 --> 01:21:35,007
The coach was killed
with Chinese poison.

1061
01:21:35,174 --> 01:21:36,778
You should look
for soccer trainers.

1062
01:21:38,443 --> 01:21:42,016
They are required to have a
knowledge of Chinese herbs.

1063
01:21:42,681 --> 01:21:44,285
She was right, of course.

1064
01:21:44,716 --> 01:21:48,596
According to statute 87223, every
trainer of the national soccer team...

1065
01:21:48,754 --> 01:21:50,825
must have a knowledge
of Chinese herbs.

1066
01:21:51,156 --> 01:21:54,865
This made it easy for him
to murder Gluant.

1067
01:21:55,828 --> 01:21:58,331
- And Bizu?
- Simple.

1068
01:21:58,497 --> 01:22:01,944
Bizu had often heard
Yuri's rants against Gluant.

1069
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:05,547
So Bizu blackmailed Yuri
and got himself killed.

1070
01:22:06,371 --> 01:22:08,749
Oh, it's you.

1071
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:13,387
A stunning shot to the head...

1072
01:22:13,879 --> 01:22:16,758
burrowing deeply
into the occipital lobe.

1073
01:22:16,915 --> 01:22:18,622
But Yuri is a soccer trainer.

1074
01:22:18,784 --> 01:22:21,321
That shot was made
by an expert marksman.

1075
01:22:21,486 --> 01:22:23,432
Chief inspector, I'm sure
you're familiar...

1076
01:22:23,589 --> 01:22:25,432
with Russian army statute 611.

1077
01:22:26,091 --> 01:22:27,365
Well, of course.

1078
01:22:27,526 --> 01:22:29,665
All members must be...

1079
01:22:29,828 --> 01:22:31,865
- expert marksmen...
- expert marksmen...

1080
01:22:32,030 --> 01:22:35,603
and understand the location
of the occipital...

1081
01:22:35,767 --> 01:22:37,940
- Occipital lobe, of course.
- Yes.

1082
01:22:38,103 --> 01:22:41,084
- Very true.
- Yes, Yuri.

1083
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:43,413
Xania is still alive.

1084
01:22:43,575 --> 01:22:47,523
But you hated her. And that's
why you are trying to kill her.

1085
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:50,558
You hated her because she
went with Bizu and then Gluant...

1086
01:22:50,716 --> 01:22:52,787
and treated you
like you were nothing.

1087
01:22:53,185 --> 01:22:56,997
But you forgot a fundamental truth
about women.

1088
01:22:57,155 --> 01:22:59,601
A woman is like a...

1089
01:22:59,758 --> 01:23:01,738
is like a...

1090
01:23:01,894 --> 01:23:03,271
artichoke.

1091
01:23:04,429 --> 01:23:08,241
You have to do a bit of work
before you get to her heart.

1092
01:23:10,102 --> 01:23:13,083
What about the diamond?
What about the Pink Panther?

1093
01:23:13,238 --> 01:23:18,051
Yes, thank you, Inspector Clouseau
for carrying out my orders.

1094
01:23:18,210 --> 01:23:19,780
Hand over the diamond, Yuri.

1095
01:23:19,945 --> 01:23:22,152
What do I care about
your stinking diamond?

1096
01:23:22,581 --> 01:23:23,992
He does not have the diamond.

1097
01:23:24,149 --> 01:23:26,686
The murderer does not have
the diamond?

1098
01:23:26,852 --> 01:23:29,230
- No.
- Well, then, where is it...

1099
01:23:29,388 --> 01:23:30,992
Inspector Clouseau?

1100
01:23:31,156 --> 01:23:34,103
It is there! In her purse.

1101
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:36,871
Let me see.

1102
01:23:49,007 --> 01:23:51,749
Sorry, Clouseau, no diamond.

1103
01:24:00,052 --> 01:24:02,225
The purse, please.

1104
01:24:08,093 --> 01:24:09,766
Could you hold that, please?

1105
01:24:21,273 --> 01:24:24,846
After Gluant came to me, he said
he decided to stop cheating on me.

1106
01:24:25,777 --> 01:24:27,950
Then he asked me to marry him...

1107
01:24:30,082 --> 01:24:32,426
and put the ring in my hands.

1108
01:24:34,853 --> 01:24:36,799
After he was killed, I thought...

1109
01:24:36,955 --> 01:24:39,902
if I came forward with the ring,
everyone would think I did it.

1110
01:24:40,058 --> 01:24:42,595
If Gluant gave you the ring
before he died...

1111
01:24:42,761 --> 01:24:48,905
then according to civil statute
812-914B, you are the rightful owner.

1112
01:24:49,067 --> 01:24:51,673
You may keep the Pink Panther.

1113
01:24:57,075 --> 01:24:59,487
But, inspector,
how did you know she had it?

1114
01:24:59,644 --> 01:25:01,146
It was simple, Ponton.

1115
01:25:01,313 --> 01:25:04,522
I was looking at a photo of myself
at the checkpoint.

1116
01:25:04,683 --> 01:25:06,492
Something caught my eye.

1117
01:25:06,651 --> 01:25:09,894
Xania's purse passing through
the x-ray machine.

1118
01:25:10,389 --> 01:25:12,892
I enlarged the photo...

1119
01:25:13,058 --> 01:25:14,537
and in it...

1120
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:16,834
the Pink Panther.

1121
01:25:16,995 --> 01:25:20,704
- The case is closed!
- Bravo, Clouseau.

1122
01:25:26,438 --> 01:25:28,247
Bravo!

1123
01:25:29,808 --> 01:25:33,119
Clouseau! Clouseau!
Clouseau! Clouseau!

1124
01:25:37,416 --> 01:25:39,488
I can't thank you enough
for giving me...

1125
01:25:39,651 --> 01:25:42,097
the opportunity to solve
the Pink Panther murder.

1126
01:25:42,254 --> 01:25:44,359
Without your decision to put me
on the case...

1127
01:25:44,523 --> 01:25:47,697
who knows, someone else might've
won the Medal of Honor this year.

1128
01:25:47,859 --> 01:25:49,133
Yes, I know.

1129
01:25:49,294 --> 01:25:53,572
I owe it all to you, chief inspector.
Without you, I would be nothing.

1130
01:25:53,732 --> 01:25:57,578
- Perhaps you still are.
- Excellent verbal joust, inspector.

1131
01:25:57,736 --> 01:25:59,943
You idiot! Oh, no.

1132
01:26:00,105 --> 01:26:02,745
- Hit it, Ponton.
- No! Clouseau!

1133
01:26:02,908 --> 01:26:04,546
Stop the car. Dear...

1134
01:26:04,709 --> 01:26:06,347
What?

1135
01:26:06,511 --> 01:26:08,081
Nothing.

1136
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:09,786
You didn't say...

1137
01:26:09,948 --> 01:26:14,454
Stop the car. Dear God,
I beg of you, stop the car?

1138
01:26:14,619 --> 01:26:16,189
No.

1139
01:26:24,863 --> 01:26:26,809
Does it hurt?

1140
01:26:32,237 --> 01:26:33,614
What?

1141
01:26:35,140 --> 01:26:36,847
I can't understand you.

1142
01:26:41,379 --> 01:26:43,859
You know what,
I think he wants to recline.

1143
01:26:44,015 --> 01:26:45,926
There's a lever right here.

1144
01:26:46,084 --> 01:26:48,189
Oh, it's on the other side, I'm sorry.

1145
01:26:48,353 --> 01:26:51,197
A bit of a reach.
Wait a minute. I'll get it.

1146
01:26:51,356 --> 01:26:53,302
I'll get it right here.

1147
01:26:53,558 --> 01:26:56,471
Is right back here.

1148
01:26:59,131 --> 01:27:00,940
There must be a simpler way...

1149
01:27:01,099 --> 01:27:04,103
of working this...
Oh, there's a remote control...

1150
01:27:04,269 --> 01:27:05,373
so that you can just...

1151
01:27:05,537 --> 01:27:08,416
It's sensitive! I hardly touched it!
But it goes up...

1152
01:27:12,811 --> 01:27:14,449
That's it! That's it!

1153
01:27:18,583 --> 01:27:22,156
- You know, Ponton.
- Yes, inspector.

1154
01:27:22,988 --> 01:27:25,935
This is a very hard time
for Inspector Dreyfus.

1155
01:27:26,091 --> 01:27:29,470
It is important that
we show compassion.

1156
01:27:29,628 --> 01:27:32,871
And we must use the gentle
healing power of laughter.

1157
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:56,829
This is going to hurt.

1158
01:27:59,224 --> 01:28:02,000
Clouseau!

1159
01:28:05,630 --> 01:28:07,974
That breeze feels good.
