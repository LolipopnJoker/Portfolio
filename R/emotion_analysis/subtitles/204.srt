1
00:00:27,263 --> 00:00:29,430
<i>Although each of the world's countries</i>

2
00:00:29,431 --> 00:00:30,628
<i>would like to dispute this fact,</i>

3
00:00:30,724 --> 00:00:32,157
<i>we French know the truth:</i>

4
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:34,489
<i>The best food in the world is made in France.</i>

5
00:00:34,595 --> 00:00:36,654
<i>The best food in France is made in Paris.</i>

6
00:00:36,764 --> 00:00:41,258
<i>And the best food in Paris, some say,
is made by Chef Auguste Gusteau.</i>

7
00:00:41,368 --> 00:00:43,734
<i>Gusteau's restaurant is the toast of Paris,</i>

8
00:00:43,837 --> 00:00:45,464
<i>booked five months in advance.</i>

9
00:00:45,573 --> 00:00:48,303
<i>And his dazzling ascent to the top of fine French cuisine</i>

10
00:00:48,409 --> 00:00:50,741
<i>has made his competitors envious.</i>

11
00:00:50,844 --> 00:00:54,143
<i>He is the youngest chef ever
to achieve a five-star rating.</i>

12
00:00:54,281 --> 00:00:56,408
<i>Chef Gusteau's cookbook, Anyone Can Cook!</i>

13
00:00:56,517 --> 00:00:58,644
<i>climbed to the top of the bestseller list.</i>

14
00:00:58,752 --> 00:01:01,050
<i>But not everyone celebrates its success.</i>

15
00:01:01,155 --> 00:01:04,056
<i>Amusing title, Anyone Can Cook!</i>

16
00:01:04,158 --> 00:01:07,855
<i>What's even more amusing is that
Gusteau actually seems to believe it.</i>

17
00:01:07,962 --> 00:01:10,453
<i>I, on the other hand, take cooking seriously.</i>

18
00:01:10,564 --> 00:01:14,330
<i>And, no, I don't think anyone can do it.</i>

19
00:01:52,606 --> 00:01:54,597
<i>This is me.</i>

20
00:01:54,975 --> 00:01:58,411
<i>I think it's apparent
I need to rethink my life a little bit.</i>

21
00:01:58,512 --> 00:02:00,104
<i>What's my problem?</i>

22
00:02:00,214 --> 00:02:02,148
<i>First of all, I'm a rat.</i>

23
00:02:04,218 --> 00:02:06,709
<i>Which means life is hard.</i>

24
00:02:07,955 --> 00:02:12,289
<i>And second, I have a highly developed
sense of taste and smell.</i>

25
00:02:13,727 --> 00:02:18,061
Flour, eggs, sugar, vanilla bean...

26
00:02:18,165 --> 00:02:20,326
Oh! Small twist of lemon.

27
00:02:20,434 --> 00:02:24,063
Whoa, you can smell all that?
You have a gift.

28
00:02:24,171 --> 00:02:27,607
<i>This is Emile, my brother.
He's easily impressed.</i>

29
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:31,269
So you can smell ingredients?
So what?

30
00:02:31,512 --> 00:02:34,447
<i>This is my dad. He's never impressed.</i>

31
00:02:34,882 --> 00:02:37,783
<i>He also happens to be the leader of our clan.</i>

32
00:02:38,052 --> 00:02:41,351
<i>So, what's wrong with having highly developed senses?</i>

33
00:02:41,455 --> 00:02:45,585
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Don't eat that!
- What's going on here?

34
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,596
<i>Turns out that funny smell was rat poison.</i>

35
00:02:49,697 --> 00:02:53,064
<i>Suddenly, Dad didn't think my talent was useless.</i>

36
00:02:53,167 --> 00:02:55,635
<i>I was feeling pretty good about my gift,</i>

37
00:02:55,736 --> 00:02:58,136
<i>until Dad gave me a job.</i>

38
00:02:58,572 --> 00:02:59,869
Clean.

39
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,207
Clean.

40
00:03:01,342 --> 00:03:02,707
<i>That's right. Poison checker.</i>

41
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:03,936
Cleanerific.

42
00:03:04,078 --> 00:03:05,545
Cleanerino.

43
00:03:06,013 --> 00:03:07,742
Close to godliness.

44
00:03:08,682 --> 00:03:12,982
Which means clean.
You know, cleanliness is close to...

45
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,949
Never mind. Move on.

46
00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:17,557
<i>Well, it made my dad proud.</i>

47
00:03:17,658 --> 00:03:22,254
Now, don't you feel better, Remy?
You've helped a noble cause.

48
00:03:22,363 --> 00:03:24,923
Noble? We're thieves, Dad.

49
00:03:25,032 --> 00:03:28,627
And what we're stealing is, let's face it, garbage.

50
00:03:28,736 --> 00:03:30,727
It isn't stealing if no one wants it.

51
00:03:30,838 --> 00:03:33,329
If no one wants it, why are we stealing it?

52
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,406
<i>Let's just say we have different points of view.</i>

53
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:39,001
<i>This much I knew:</i>

54
00:03:39,113 --> 00:03:43,049
<i>If you are what you eat,
then I only want to eat the good stuff.</i>

55
00:03:43,217 --> 00:03:44,684
<i>But to my dad...</i>

56
00:03:44,785 --> 00:03:45,911
Food is fuel.

57
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:49,648
You get picky about what you put
in the tank, your engine is gonna die.

58
00:03:49,757 --> 00:03:51,315
Now shut up and eat your garbage.

59
00:03:51,425 --> 00:03:52,915
Look, if we're going to be thieves,

60
00:03:53,026 --> 00:03:54,891
why not steal the good stuff in the kitchen,

61
00:03:54,995 --> 00:03:56,587
where nothing is poisoned?

62
00:03:56,697 --> 00:03:59,257
First of all, we are not thieves.

63
00:03:59,366 --> 00:04:02,233
Secondly, stay out of the kitchen
and away from the humans.

64
00:04:02,336 --> 00:04:03,530
It's dangerous.

65
00:04:03,637 --> 00:04:05,366
<i>I know I'm supposed to hate humans,</i>

66
00:04:05,472 --> 00:04:07,497
<i>but there's something about them.</i>

67
00:04:07,608 --> 00:04:11,977
<i>They don't just survive.
They discover, they create.</i>

68
00:04:12,346 --> 00:04:14,507
<i>I mean, just look at what they do with food.</i>

69
00:04:14,615 --> 00:04:16,105
<i>How can I describe it?</i>

70
00:04:16,216 --> 00:04:20,175
<i>Good food is like music you can taste,
color you can smell.</i>

71
00:04:20,287 --> 00:04:22,755
<i>There is excellence all around you.</i>

72
00:04:22,856 --> 00:04:26,383
<i>You need only be aware to stop and savor it.</i>

73
00:04:30,297 --> 00:04:32,492
<i>Oh, Gusteau was right.</i>

74
00:04:32,766 --> 00:04:35,326
<i>Oh, mmm, yeah.</i>

75
00:04:35,736 --> 00:04:37,328
<i>Oh, amazing.</i>

76
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:41,201
<i>Each flavor was totally unique.</i>

77
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:48,476
<i>But combine one flavor with another,</i>

78
00:04:48,582 --> 00:04:51,346
<i>and something new was created.</i>

79
00:04:57,057 --> 00:04:59,548
<i>So now I had a secret life.</i>

80
00:05:07,401 --> 00:05:09,961
<i>The only one who knew about it was Emile.</i>

81
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,465
Hey, Emile. Emile.

82
00:05:12,806 --> 00:05:14,797
I found a mushroom.

83
00:05:14,908 --> 00:05:18,241
Come on, you're good at hiding food.
Help me find a good place to put this.

84
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:21,773
<i>He doesn't understand me, but I can be myself around him.</i>

85
00:05:21,882 --> 00:05:23,611
Why are you walking like that?

86
00:05:23,717 --> 00:05:26,686
I don't want to constantly have to wash my paws.

87
00:05:26,787 --> 00:05:28,846
Did you ever think about how we walk on the same paws

88
00:05:28,956 --> 00:05:30,150
that we handle food with?

89
00:05:30,257 --> 00:05:32,316
You ever think about what we put into our mouths?

90
00:05:32,426 --> 00:05:33,484
All the time.

91
00:05:33,594 --> 00:05:36,154
When I eat, I don't want to taste
everywhere my paws have been.

92
00:05:36,263 --> 00:05:37,389
Well, go ahead.

93
00:05:37,498 --> 00:05:40,092
But if Dad sees you walking like that,
he's not going to like it.

94
00:05:41,335 --> 00:05:43,166
What have you got there?

95
00:05:43,504 --> 00:05:44,528
Ah, oh, oh...

96
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:47,634
You found cheese?

97
00:05:48,141 --> 00:05:52,475
And not just any cheese.
Tomme de chèvre de pays!

98
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:55,170
That would go beautifully with my mushroom.

99
00:05:55,282 --> 00:05:56,249
And...

100
00:05:58,485 --> 00:06:01,682
This rosemary! This rosemary

101
00:06:01,788 --> 00:06:05,451
with maybe with a few drops from this sweet grass.

102
00:06:05,926 --> 00:06:08,918
Well, throw it on the pile, I guess,
and then we'll... You know...

103
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:13,432
We don't want to throw this in
with the garbage. This is special.

104
00:06:13,534 --> 00:06:15,161
But we're supposed to return to the colony

105
00:06:15,269 --> 00:06:16,827
before sundown or, you know, Dad's gonna...

106
00:06:16,937 --> 00:06:17,961
Emile!

107
00:06:18,071 --> 00:06:19,971
There are possibilities unexplored here.

108
00:06:20,073 --> 00:06:21,563
We got to cook this.

109
00:06:21,675 --> 00:06:26,135
Now, exactly how we cook this is the real question...

110
00:06:27,414 --> 00:06:28,381
Yeah.

111
00:06:29,082 --> 00:06:31,346
The key is to keep turning it.

112
00:06:31,451 --> 00:06:34,852
Get the smoky flavor nice and even.

113
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:38,284
That storm's getting closer.

114
00:06:38,592 --> 00:06:43,291
Hey, Remy, you think that maybe we shouldn't be so...

115
00:06:55,142 --> 00:06:56,609
You got to taste this!

116
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:01,010
This is... It's got this kind of...
It's burny, melty...

117
00:07:01,114 --> 00:07:03,981
It's not really a smoky taste.
It's a certain... It's kind of like a...

118
00:07:05,218 --> 00:07:09,120
It's got, like, this "ba-boom, zap"
kind of taste. Don't you think?

119
00:07:09,222 --> 00:07:12,419
- What would you call that flavor?
- Lightning-y?

120
00:07:12,693 --> 00:07:17,153
Yeah. It's lightning-y!
We got to do that again.

121
00:07:17,264 --> 00:07:19,926
Okay, when the next storm comes,
we'll go up on the roof...

122
00:07:20,033 --> 00:07:23,469
I know what this needs! Saffron!
A little saffron would make this!

123
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:26,095
Saffron. Why do I get the feeling

124
00:07:26,206 --> 00:07:28,140
- it's in the kitchen?
- It's in the kitchen.

125
00:07:35,082 --> 00:07:37,209
- Saffron.
- Not good.

126
00:07:37,317 --> 00:07:38,784
Saffron.

127
00:07:38,885 --> 00:07:42,753
Don't like it. She's gonna wake up.

128
00:07:42,856 --> 00:07:44,289
I've been down here a million times.

129
00:07:44,391 --> 00:07:47,554
She turns on the cooking channel,
boom, she never wakes up.

130
00:07:47,661 --> 00:07:49,652
You've been here a million times?

131
00:07:49,763 --> 00:07:53,300
I'm telling you, saffron will be
just the thing. Gusteau swears by it.

132
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:55,364
Okay. Who's Gusteau?

133
00:07:55,469 --> 00:07:58,734
Just the greatest chef in the world.
Wrote this cookbook.

134
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:01,706
Wait. You read?

135
00:08:01,808 --> 00:08:06,609
- Well, not excessively.
- Oh, man. Does Dad know?

136
00:08:06,713 --> 00:08:11,309
You could fill a book, a lot
of books, with things Dad doesn't know.

137
00:08:11,418 --> 00:08:15,548
And they have, which is why I read.
Which is also our secret.

138
00:08:15,722 --> 00:08:17,121
I don't like secrets.

139
00:08:17,224 --> 00:08:21,058
All this cooking and reading and TV-watching

140
00:08:21,161 --> 00:08:23,459
while we read and cook.

141
00:08:23,563 --> 00:08:26,657
It's like you're involving me in crime, and I let you.

142
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:28,166
Why do I let you?

143
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:34,898
What's taking those kids so long?

144
00:08:35,976 --> 00:08:39,002
Ah, L'Aquila Saffron. Italian. Huh?

145
00:08:39,246 --> 00:08:42,841
Gusteau says it's excellent.
Good thing the old lady is a food love...

146
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:45,611
<i>Forget mystique.
This is about your cooking.</i>

147
00:08:45,719 --> 00:08:48,187
Hey! That's Gusteau. Emile, look.

148
00:08:48,189 --> 00:08:48,689
<i>Great cooking is not for the faint of heart.</i>

149
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,816
<i>Great cooking is not for the faint of heart.</i>

150
00:08:50,924 --> 00:08:53,552
<i>You must be imaginative, strong hearted.</i>

151
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,719
<i>You must try things that may not work.</i>

152
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:57,922
<i>And you must not let anyone define your limits</i>

153
00:08:58,031 --> 00:09:00,158
<i>because of where you come from.</i>

154
00:09:00,267 --> 00:09:02,531
<i>Your only limit is your soul.</i>

155
00:09:02,636 --> 00:09:09,599
<i>What I say is true. Anyone can cook.
But only the fearless can be great.</i>

156
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,675
Pure poetry.

157
00:09:11,778 --> 00:09:13,803
<i>But it was not to last.</i>

158
00:09:14,214 --> 00:09:17,081
<i>Gusteau's restaurant lost one of its five stars</i>

159
00:09:17,184 --> 00:09:21,848
<i>after a scathing review
by France's top food critic, Anton Ego.</i>

160
00:09:22,422 --> 00:09:24,549
<i>It was a severe blow to Gusteau,</i>

161
00:09:24,658 --> 00:09:27,684
<i>and the brokenhearted chef died shortly afterwards,</i>

162
00:09:27,794 --> 00:09:31,890
<i>which, according to tradition,
meant the loss of another star.</i>

163
00:09:32,132 --> 00:09:34,498
Gusteau is dead?

164
00:09:35,502 --> 00:09:36,491
Oh!

165
00:09:38,271 --> 00:09:40,205
Oh! Oh!

166
00:09:46,046 --> 00:09:47,377
Oh!

167
00:09:48,715 --> 00:09:49,909
Run!

168
00:09:52,486 --> 00:09:54,579
No, you'll lead her to the colony!

169
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,308
- Help, Remy, help!
- Emile! Start swinging the light!

170
00:10:16,309 --> 00:10:18,076
- Help, Remy, help!
- Emile! Start swinging the light!

171
00:10:18,845 --> 00:10:20,278
Try to grab you.

172
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,581
Emile, swing to me.

173
00:10:59,319 --> 00:11:02,755
Evacuate! Everyone, to the boats.

174
00:11:06,827 --> 00:11:08,661
- Let me through!
- The book.

175
00:11:08,662 --> 00:11:09,763
- Let me through!
- The book.

176
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,825
Excuse me. Move, move.

177
00:11:28,081 --> 00:11:31,175
Go, go, go, go. Move, move, move.

178
00:11:32,085 --> 00:11:35,054
Get the bridge up! Move it, move it!

179
00:11:35,722 --> 00:11:37,155
Hey, Johnny! Hurry!

180
00:11:37,357 --> 00:11:38,847
Push off. Come on.

181
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,020
Get hold!

182
00:11:44,764 --> 00:11:47,665
- Take the baby. Here!
- Give me your paw.

183
00:11:48,702 --> 00:11:50,294
Hey, wait for me!

184
00:11:55,242 --> 00:11:57,369
Is everybody here?
Do we have everybody?

185
00:11:57,477 --> 00:12:00,037
- Wait a minute. Where's Remy?
- Right here. I'm coming.

186
00:12:00,614 --> 00:12:01,945
I'm coming!

187
00:12:02,816 --> 00:12:05,808
Hold on, Son.
Give him something to grab on to.

188
00:12:05,986 --> 00:12:07,977
Come on, boy. Paddle, Son.

189
00:12:08,088 --> 00:12:10,022
Come on. Reach for it.

190
00:12:10,957 --> 00:12:12,185
You can do it.

191
00:12:16,363 --> 00:12:17,853
- Remy!
- Dad!

192
00:12:17,964 --> 00:12:20,694
Come on. You can make it.
You can make it.

193
00:12:26,706 --> 00:12:28,640
Guys, wait. Stop!

194
00:12:28,742 --> 00:12:30,801
Remy. Come on. Paddle.

195
00:12:30,911 --> 00:12:34,574
Hold on! Wait for me. Hold on.

196
00:12:37,217 --> 00:12:38,445
Dad?

197
00:12:41,588 --> 00:12:42,555
Dad?

198
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,890
Which way?

199
00:13:45,418 --> 00:13:46,853
<i>I waited</i>

200
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:50,756
<i>for a sound,</i>

201
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:54,649
<i>a voice,</i>

202
00:13:56,896 --> 00:13:58,420
<i>a sign,</i>

203
00:14:00,834 --> 00:14:02,267
<i>something.</i>

204
00:14:21,121 --> 00:14:24,887
If you are hungry, go up and look around, Remy.

205
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,219
Why do you wait and mope?

206
00:14:29,662 --> 00:14:33,928
Well, I've just lost my family, all my friends,

207
00:14:35,101 --> 00:14:36,568
probably forever.

208
00:14:37,003 --> 00:14:39,733
- How do you know?
- Well, I...

209
00:14:40,407 --> 00:14:44,138
You are an illustration.
Why am I talking to you?

210
00:14:44,344 --> 00:14:49,043
Well, you just lost your family,
all your friends. You are lonely.

211
00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:51,344
Yeah. Well, you're dead.

212
00:14:51,451 --> 00:14:54,784
Ah, but that is no match for wishful thinking.

213
00:14:54,888 --> 00:14:56,617
If you focus on what you've left behind,

214
00:14:56,723 --> 00:14:59,089
you'll never be able to see what lies ahead.

215
00:14:59,192 --> 00:15:01,387
Now go up and look around.

216
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:33,156
Oh!

217
00:15:38,531 --> 00:15:39,691
Champagne!

218
00:15:41,101 --> 00:15:42,193
What are you doing?

219
00:15:43,403 --> 00:15:44,529
I'm hungry.

220
00:15:44,737 --> 00:15:46,136
I don't know where I am,

221
00:15:46,239 --> 00:15:47,934
and I don't know when I'll find food again.

222
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:51,636
Remy, you are better than that.
You are a cook.

223
00:15:51,845 --> 00:15:56,748
A cook makes. A thief takes.
You are not a thief.

224
00:15:57,417 --> 00:15:59,078
But I am hungry.

225
00:16:00,787 --> 00:16:02,448
Food will come, Remy.

226
00:16:02,555 --> 00:16:07,117
Food always comes to those who love to cook.

227
00:16:19,205 --> 00:16:21,503
- You think I am playing?
- You don't have the guts.

228
00:17:08,922 --> 00:17:10,048
Paris?

229
00:17:10,657 --> 00:17:14,149
All this time I've been underneath Paris?

230
00:17:16,262 --> 00:17:17,456
Wow.

231
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,861
It's beautiful.

232
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:25,663
The most beautiful.

233
00:17:26,005 --> 00:17:28,599
Gusteau's? Your restaurant?

234
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:31,142
You've led me to your restaurant.

235
00:17:32,212 --> 00:17:37,411
It seems as though I have. Yes.
There it is! I have led you to it!

236
00:17:37,517 --> 00:17:38,882
I got to see this.

237
00:17:39,229 --> 00:17:41,196
- Ready to go on table seven.
- Coming around.

238
00:17:41,221 --> 00:17:42,955
- One order of steamed pike up.
- Coming up.

239
00:17:43,022 --> 00:17:44,751
I need more soup bowls, please.

240
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:47,451
I need two rack of lamb.
I need more leeks.

241
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,825
I need two salmon, three salade composée, and three filet.

242
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,830
Three orders of salade composée working.

243
00:17:52,932 --> 00:17:54,627
Firing two orders, seared salmon.

244
00:17:54,734 --> 00:17:57,103
Three filet working. I need plates.

245
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:00,032
- Fire seven.
- Three salade composée up.

246
00:18:00,139 --> 00:18:02,039
Don't mess with my mise!

247
00:18:02,275 --> 00:18:03,367
Open down low.

248
00:18:03,476 --> 00:18:06,411
I'm getting buried here.

249
00:18:06,579 --> 00:18:09,275
Hello, Chef Skinner.
How your night be now?

250
00:18:09,382 --> 00:18:11,407
<i>- Bonjour, chef.
- Hello, Chef Skinner.</i>

251
00:18:11,517 --> 00:18:14,008
<i>- Evening, chef.
- Ordering deux filet.</i>

252
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,985
Hey, boss, look who is here.

253
00:18:16,089 --> 00:18:18,489
Alfredo Linguini, Renata's little boy.

254
00:18:18,591 --> 00:18:20,218
- Hi.
- All grown up, eh?

255
00:18:20,326 --> 00:18:22,851
You remember Renata, Gusteau's old flame?

256
00:18:24,163 --> 00:18:27,291
- Yes. How are you...
- Linguini.

257
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,598
Yes, Linguini. So nice of you to visit.
How is...

258
00:18:31,704 --> 00:18:33,535
- My mother?
- Renata.

259
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,473
- Yes, Renata. How is she?
- Good.

260
00:18:36,776 --> 00:18:40,177
Well, not... She's been better. I mean...

261
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,542
She died.

262
00:18:42,115 --> 00:18:43,309
Oh.

263
00:18:43,683 --> 00:18:44,843
I'm sorry.

264
00:18:44,951 --> 00:18:48,546
Oh, don't be. She believed in heaven,
so she's covered.

265
00:18:48,688 --> 00:18:51,179
You know, afterlife-wise?

266
00:18:59,999 --> 00:19:03,093
- What's this?
- She left it for you.

267
00:19:03,336 --> 00:19:06,669
I think she hoped it would help me,

268
00:19:06,773 --> 00:19:09,173
you know, get a job here.

269
00:19:09,275 --> 00:19:11,937
But of course.
Gusteau wouldn't hesitate.

270
00:19:12,045 --> 00:19:13,103
Any son of Renata's is more than...

271
00:19:13,212 --> 00:19:16,841
Yes, well, we could file this
and if something suitable opens up...

272
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:18,007
We have already hired him.

273
00:19:18,117 --> 00:19:21,848
What? How dare you hire someone
without my...

274
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:23,683
We needed a garbage boy.

275
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,790
Oh, garbage. Well...

276
00:19:26,993 --> 00:19:28,688
I'm glad it worked out.

277
00:19:31,964 --> 00:19:33,192
Uh...

278
00:19:38,471 --> 00:19:39,870
I can't believe it.

279
00:19:40,139 --> 00:19:43,302
A real gourmet kitchen, and I get to watch.

280
00:19:43,543 --> 00:19:46,637
You've read my book.
Let us see how much you know, huh?

281
00:19:46,846 --> 00:19:48,404
Which one is the chef?

282
00:19:48,514 --> 00:19:50,379
Oh! Uh...

283
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:53,182
- Oh, that guy.
- Very good.

284
00:19:53,419 --> 00:19:54,909
Who is next in command?

285
00:19:55,021 --> 00:19:57,819
The sous chef. There.

286
00:19:58,157 --> 00:20:02,059
The sous is responsible for the kitchen
when the chef's not around.

287
00:20:02,328 --> 00:20:05,661
Saucier, in charge of sauces.
Very important.

288
00:20:05,865 --> 00:20:09,961
Chef de partie, demi-chef de partie, both important.

289
00:20:10,069 --> 00:20:12,867
Commis, commis, they're cooks.
Very important.

290
00:20:13,072 --> 00:20:16,166
You are a clever rat. Now, who is that?

291
00:20:16,876 --> 00:20:19,003
Oh, him? He's nobody.

292
00:20:19,112 --> 00:20:21,171
Not nobody. He is part of the kitchen.

293
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,145
<i>No, he's a plongeur or something.</i>

294
00:20:23,249 --> 00:20:25,740
He washes dishes or takes out
the garbage. He doesn't cook.

295
00:20:25,852 --> 00:20:29,083
- But he could.
- Uh, no.

296
00:20:29,188 --> 00:20:31,418
How do you know?
What do I always say?

297
00:20:31,524 --> 00:20:33,151
Anyone can cook.

298
00:20:33,259 --> 00:20:37,195
Well, yeah, anyone can.
That doesn't mean that anyone should.

299
00:20:37,296 --> 00:20:40,857
Well, that is not stopping him. See?

300
00:20:41,634 --> 00:20:46,264
What is he doing?
No. No! No, this is terrible!

301
00:20:48,074 --> 00:20:51,703
He's ruining the soup.
And nobody's noticing?

302
00:20:51,911 --> 00:20:53,811
It's your restaurant. Do something.

303
00:20:53,913 --> 00:20:57,076
What can I do?
I am a figment of your imagination.

304
00:20:57,183 --> 00:20:58,450
But he's ruining the soup!
We got to tell someone that he's...

305
00:20:58,451 --> 00:21:00,485
But he's ruining the soup!
We got to tell someone that he's...

306
00:21:07,493 --> 00:21:10,291
Table five coming up, right now.

307
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,467
- Coming down the line.
- Set.

308
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,268
Ah!

309
00:21:28,581 --> 00:21:30,640
Hot! Open oven!

310
00:21:38,324 --> 00:21:39,655
Ah!

311
00:21:48,301 --> 00:21:49,893
Coming around.

312
00:22:05,885 --> 00:22:07,079
Ooh!

313
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:13,926
<i>Oui, chef.
One filet mignon, three lamb, two duck.</i>

314
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,974
<i>Fire those soufflés for table six, ja.</i>

315
00:22:37,183 --> 00:22:39,117
- Five minutes, chef.
- Oh, God.

316
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:46,890
Tonight, I'd like to present the foie gras.

317
00:22:46,993 --> 00:22:48,460
It has a wonderful finish.

318
00:22:48,561 --> 00:22:49,858
- Ooh!
- Ah!

319
00:22:53,165 --> 00:22:54,132
Hmm.

320
00:23:07,914 --> 00:23:10,348
Ready to go on table seven.
Come on! Let's go!

321
00:23:10,449 --> 00:23:11,507
<i>Oui, chef.</i>

322
00:23:53,259 --> 00:23:55,159
Remy! What are you waiting for?

323
00:23:55,261 --> 00:23:57,092
Is this going to become a regular thing with you?

324
00:23:57,196 --> 00:23:59,858
You know how to fix it.
This is your chance.

325
00:24:54,687 --> 00:24:59,147
The soup! Where is the soup?
Out of my way.

326
00:24:59,725 --> 00:25:01,852
Move it, garbage boy!

327
00:25:02,561 --> 00:25:05,121
You are cooking?

328
00:25:05,331 --> 00:25:08,767
How dare you cook in my kitchen?

329
00:25:08,868 --> 00:25:10,927
Where do you get the gall

330
00:25:11,037 --> 00:25:14,666
to even attempt something so monumentally idiotic?

331
00:25:14,774 --> 00:25:16,765
I should have you drawn and quartered!

332
00:25:16,876 --> 00:25:19,970
I'll do it. I think the law is on my side.

333
00:25:21,147 --> 00:25:22,614
Larousse, draw and quarter this man

334
00:25:22,715 --> 00:25:27,880
after you put him in the duck press
to squeeze the fat out of his head.

335
00:25:27,987 --> 00:25:31,115
- What are you blathering about?
- The soup!

336
00:25:33,392 --> 00:25:34,689
Soup?

337
00:25:35,394 --> 00:25:37,055
Stop that soup!

338
00:25:37,263 --> 00:25:40,960
No!

339
00:25:55,381 --> 00:25:56,473
Waiter.

340
00:25:58,084 --> 00:26:00,382
Linguini!

341
00:26:00,586 --> 00:26:02,076
You're fired!

342
00:26:02,288 --> 00:26:05,223
F-I-R-E-D! Fired!

343
00:26:05,324 --> 00:26:07,622
She wants to see the chef.

344
00:26:07,727 --> 00:26:09,820
But he...

345
00:26:25,211 --> 00:26:29,079
- What did the customer say?
- It was not a customer. It was a critic.

346
00:26:29,181 --> 00:26:31,342
- Ego?
- Solène LeClaire.

347
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:35,511
- LeClaire? What did she say?
- She likes the soup.

348
00:26:35,688 --> 00:26:37,315
- Wait.
- What do you mean, "Wait"?

349
00:26:37,423 --> 00:26:39,050
You're the reason I'm in this mess.

350
00:26:39,158 --> 00:26:40,658
Someone is asking about your soup.

351
00:26:50,636 --> 00:26:53,230
What are you playing at?

352
00:26:55,641 --> 00:26:56,903
Am I still fired?

353
00:26:57,009 --> 00:26:59,136
- You can't fire him.
- What?

354
00:26:59,245 --> 00:27:02,544
LeClaire likes it, yeah?
She made a point of telling you so.

355
00:27:02,648 --> 00:27:03,945
If she write a review to that effect

356
00:27:04,049 --> 00:27:06,017
and find out you fired the cook responsible...

357
00:27:06,118 --> 00:27:09,281
- He's a garbage boy.
- Who made something she liked.

358
00:27:09,388 --> 00:27:11,652
How can we claim to represent the name of Gusteau

359
00:27:11,757 --> 00:27:13,918
if we don't uphold his most cherished belief?

360
00:27:14,026 --> 00:27:16,893
<i>And what belief is that, Mademoiselle Tatou?</i>

361
00:27:16,996 --> 00:27:17,985
Anyone can cook.

362
00:27:22,868 --> 00:27:28,568
Perhaps I have been a bit harsh on our new garbage boy.

363
00:27:28,974 --> 00:27:31,238
He has taken a bold risk

364
00:27:31,343 --> 00:27:35,746
and we should reward that, as Chef Gusteau would have.

365
00:27:36,115 --> 00:27:39,107
If he wishes to swim in dangerous waters,

366
00:27:39,218 --> 00:27:40,708
who are we to deny him?

367
00:27:41,954 --> 00:27:44,184
- You were escaping?
- Oh, yeah.

368
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:48,454
Since you have expressed
such an interest in his cooking career,

369
00:27:48,561 --> 00:27:49,926
you shall be responsible for it.

370
00:27:52,031 --> 00:27:53,464
Anyone else?

371
00:27:55,467 --> 00:27:57,332
Then back to work.

372
00:27:58,037 --> 00:28:01,564
You are either very lucky or very unlucky.

373
00:28:01,807 --> 00:28:07,177
You will make the soup again,
and this time, I'll be paying attention.

374
00:28:07,446 --> 00:28:10,210
Very close attention.

375
00:28:10,516 --> 00:28:14,953
They think you might be a cook.
But you know what I think, Linguini?

376
00:28:15,187 --> 00:28:18,554
I think you are a sneaky, overreaching little...

377
00:28:19,825 --> 00:28:21,053
Rat!

378
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:24,985
- Rat!
- Get the rat.

379
00:28:25,197 --> 00:28:27,256
Linguini. Get something to trap it.

380
00:28:27,366 --> 00:28:29,000
It's getting away.
Get it, get it, get it.

381
00:28:29,668 --> 00:28:31,533
- What should I do now?
- Kill it.

382
00:28:31,637 --> 00:28:34,162
- Now?
- No, not in the kitchen. Are you mad?

383
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,864
Do you know what would happen to us

384
00:28:35,975 --> 00:28:38,443
if anyone knew we had a rat in our kitchen?

385
00:28:38,544 --> 00:28:40,171
They'd close us down.

386
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:42,679
Our reputation is hanging by a thread as it is.

387
00:28:42,781 --> 00:28:46,911
Take it away from here. Far away.
Kill it. Dispose of it. Go!

388
00:28:47,753 --> 00:28:49,186
Whoa!

389
00:28:52,825 --> 00:28:53,792
Doh!

390
00:29:23,589 --> 00:29:27,423
Don't look at me like that!
You aren't the only one who's trapped.

391
00:29:27,526 --> 00:29:29,653
They expect me to cook it again!

392
00:29:29,895 --> 00:29:32,659
I mean, I'm not ambitious.
I wasn't trying to cook.

393
00:29:32,765 --> 00:29:34,892
I was just trying to stay out of trouble.

394
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,026
You're the one who was getting fancy with the spices!

395
00:29:38,137 --> 00:29:43,040
What did you throw in there? Oregano?
No? What? Rosemary?

396
00:29:43,309 --> 00:29:45,777
That's a spice, isn't it? Rosemary?

397
00:29:46,312 --> 00:29:48,780
You didn't throw rosemary in there?

398
00:29:49,114 --> 00:29:53,210
Then what was all the flipping and all the throwing the...

399
00:29:57,256 --> 00:30:00,657
I need this job. I've lost so many.

400
00:30:01,026 --> 00:30:05,122
I don't know how to cook, and now
I'm actually talking to a rat as if you...

401
00:30:06,332 --> 00:30:07,560
Did you nod?

402
00:30:07,666 --> 00:30:09,793
Have you been nodding?

403
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:13,033
You understand me?

404
00:30:13,572 --> 00:30:15,233
So I'm not crazy!

405
00:30:16,442 --> 00:30:18,501
Wait a second, wait a second.

406
00:30:19,578 --> 00:30:22,274
I can't cook, can I?

407
00:30:24,283 --> 00:30:26,046
But you...

408
00:30:26,719 --> 00:30:29,517
You can, right?

409
00:30:30,756 --> 00:30:33,224
Look, don't be so modest.
You're a rat, for Pete's sake.

410
00:30:33,325 --> 00:30:35,725
Whatever you did, they liked it.

411
00:30:36,328 --> 00:30:38,888
Yeah. This could work.

412
00:30:39,732 --> 00:30:40,960
Hey, they liked the soup!

413
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:49,533
They liked the soup.
Do you think you could do it again?

414
00:30:53,145 --> 00:30:55,579
Okay, I'm going to let you out now.

415
00:30:56,382 --> 00:30:59,545
But we're together on this. Right?

416
00:31:01,253 --> 00:31:02,743
Okay.

417
00:32:13,025 --> 00:32:14,959
So this is it.

418
00:32:15,427 --> 00:32:19,264
I mean, it's not much, but it's, you know...

419
00:32:21,467 --> 00:32:22,832
Not much.

420
00:32:25,337 --> 00:32:26,565
It could be worse.

421
00:32:26,672 --> 00:32:29,072
There's heat and light and a couch with a TV.

422
00:32:29,174 --> 00:32:31,608
So, you know, what's mine is yours.

423
00:32:32,644 --> 00:32:34,043
<i>Are you...</i>

424
00:32:34,146 --> 00:32:36,444
<i>Is this a dream?</i>

425
00:32:36,548 --> 00:32:38,846
<i>The best kind of dream.</i>

426
00:32:39,218 --> 00:32:40,378
<i>One we can share.</i>

427
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,212
<i>But why here?</i>

428
00:32:43,755 --> 00:32:45,279
<i>Why now?</i>

429
00:32:46,225 --> 00:32:47,954
<i>Why not here?</i>

430
00:32:48,227 --> 00:32:49,956
<i>Why not now?</i>

431
00:32:50,762 --> 00:32:54,789
<i>What better place to dream than in Paris?</i>

432
00:33:07,913 --> 00:33:10,143
Morning, Little Chef. Rise and...

433
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:12,844
Oh, no.

434
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,153
Idiot!
I knew this would happen!

435
00:33:16,255 --> 00:33:19,053
I let a rat into my place and tell him what's mine is his!

436
00:33:19,158 --> 00:33:20,284
Eggs, gone!

437
00:33:20,392 --> 00:33:23,793
Stupid! He's stolen food
and hit the road! What did I expect?

438
00:33:23,896 --> 00:33:26,387
That's what I get for trusting a...

439
00:33:29,034 --> 00:33:30,831
Hi. Is that for me?

440
00:33:39,511 --> 00:33:40,739
Mmm!

441
00:33:40,913 --> 00:33:43,541
That's good. What did you put in this?

442
00:33:45,617 --> 00:33:47,107
Where'd you get that?

443
00:33:50,322 --> 00:33:55,021
Look, it's delicious. But don't steal.
I'll buy some spices, okay?

444
00:33:58,263 --> 00:34:01,664
Oh, no. We're going to be late.
And on the first day!

445
00:34:01,767 --> 00:34:03,029
Come on, Little Chef!

446
00:34:03,268 --> 00:34:05,065
"Though I, like many other critic,

447
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:08,503
"had written off Gusteau as irrelevant
since the great chef's death,

448
00:34:08,607 --> 00:34:13,169
"the soup was a revelation.
A spicy yet subtle taste experience."

449
00:34:13,278 --> 00:34:15,269
- Solène LeClaire?
- Yes!

450
00:34:15,714 --> 00:34:19,878
"Against all odds, Gusteau's has recaptured our attention.

451
00:34:19,985 --> 00:34:22,818
"Only time will tell if they deserve it."

452
00:34:25,657 --> 00:34:26,988
Well...

453
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,097
You know.

454
00:34:39,171 --> 00:34:43,301
Look, I know it's stupid and weird,
but neither of us can do this alone,

455
00:34:43,408 --> 00:34:46,866
so we got to do it together, right?
You with me?

456
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:50,648
So let's do this thing!

457
00:34:53,652 --> 00:34:54,914
I...

458
00:35:06,331 --> 00:35:11,769
Welcome to hell.
Now, recreate the soup.

459
00:35:12,004 --> 00:35:15,770
Take as much time as you need.
All week if you must.

460
00:35:16,375 --> 00:35:17,637
Soup.

461
00:35:30,489 --> 00:35:31,456
You little...

462
00:35:32,624 --> 00:35:33,716
Ow!

463
00:35:43,368 --> 00:35:44,630
You son of a...

464
00:35:52,544 --> 00:35:54,307
You got...

465
00:36:09,861 --> 00:36:11,761
This is not going to work, Little Chef!

466
00:36:11,863 --> 00:36:14,423
I'm going to lose it if we do this anymore.

467
00:36:14,533 --> 00:36:16,967
We've got to figure out something else.

468
00:36:17,069 --> 00:36:19,299
Something that doesn't involve any biting, or nipping,

469
00:36:19,404 --> 00:36:22,100
or running up and down my body with your little rat feet.

470
00:36:22,207 --> 00:36:24,903
The biting! No! Scampering! No!

471
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:28,241
No scampering or scurrying.
Understand, Little Chef?

472
00:36:29,514 --> 00:36:30,640
Little Chef?

473
00:36:32,851 --> 00:36:34,512
Oh, you're hungry.

474
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:44,260
Okay. So let's think this out.

475
00:36:44,696 --> 00:36:48,928
You know how to cook, and I know how to appear

476
00:36:49,735 --> 00:36:50,759
human.

477
00:36:50,869 --> 00:36:53,736
We need to work out a system so that I do what you want

478
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:56,865
in a way that doesn't look like
I'm being controlled by a tiny rat chef.

479
00:36:56,975 --> 00:36:59,068
Would you listen to me? I'm insane!
I'm insane! I'm insane!

480
00:36:59,177 --> 00:37:02,169
In a refrigerator talking to a rat
about cooking in a gourmet restaurant.

481
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,145
- I will never pull this off!
- Linguini?

482
00:37:04,249 --> 00:37:05,216
We gotta communicate.

483
00:37:05,317 --> 00:37:09,549
I can't be constantly checking
for a yes or no head shake from a...

484
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:13,321
The rat! I saw it!

485
00:37:13,525 --> 00:37:16,585
- A rat?
- Yes, a rat. Right next to you.

486
00:37:17,629 --> 00:37:20,427
What are you doing in here?

487
00:37:20,632 --> 00:37:25,569
I'm just familiarizing myself with,
you know, the vegetables and such.

488
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,001
Get out.

489
00:37:28,673 --> 00:37:32,040
One can get too familiar with vegetables, you know!

490
00:37:32,844 --> 00:37:35,813
That was close. Are you okay up there?

491
00:37:37,115 --> 00:37:38,514
Whoa!

492
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,684
How did you do that?

493
00:38:03,842 --> 00:38:06,208
That's strangely involuntary!

494
00:38:08,246 --> 00:38:12,273
<i>One look and I knew we had the same crazy idea.</i>

495
00:38:13,251 --> 00:38:14,775
Okay.

496
00:38:17,022 --> 00:38:18,080
Huh?

497
00:38:25,397 --> 00:38:28,195
Where are you taking me? Wait.

498
00:38:32,671 --> 00:38:33,933
Whoa!

499
00:38:37,042 --> 00:38:38,737
Wait. I'm sorry.

500
00:38:40,045 --> 00:38:41,444
Whoa!

501
00:38:43,415 --> 00:38:44,507
Okay.

502
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:46,676
Mmm-hmm...

503
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:55,526
Okay.

504
00:39:31,663 --> 00:39:33,426
Whoa!

505
00:39:51,516 --> 00:39:52,881
Whoa!

506
00:39:55,387 --> 00:39:56,684
<i>À votre santé!</i>

507
00:40:02,527 --> 00:40:03,926
All right.

508
00:40:30,855 --> 00:40:32,083
That should do it.

509
00:40:34,693 --> 00:40:35,785
Mmm.

510
00:40:35,894 --> 00:40:40,922
Congratulations. You were able to
repeat your accidental success.

511
00:40:41,032 --> 00:40:45,696
But you'll need to know more than soup
if you are to survive in my kitchen, boy.

512
00:40:45,804 --> 00:40:50,298
Colette will be responsible for
teaching you how we do things here.

513
00:40:51,409 --> 00:40:53,775
Listen, I just want you to know

514
00:40:53,878 --> 00:40:56,711
how honored I am to be studying under such...

515
00:40:56,815 --> 00:41:00,182
No! You listen. I just want you to know
exactly who you are dealing with.

516
00:41:00,285 --> 00:41:01,686
How many women do you see in this kitchen?

517
00:41:01,786 --> 00:41:03,151
Well, I...

518
00:41:03,254 --> 00:41:05,654
- Only me. Why do you think that is?
- Well, I...

519
00:41:05,757 --> 00:41:07,952
Because haute cuisine is an antiquated hierarchy

520
00:41:08,059 --> 00:41:10,687
built upon rules written by stupid old men.

521
00:41:10,795 --> 00:41:14,253
Rules designed to make it impossible
for women to enter this world.

522
00:41:14,366 --> 00:41:16,630
But still I'm here. How did this happen?

523
00:41:16,735 --> 00:41:19,329
Because, well, because you...

524
00:41:19,437 --> 00:41:21,564
Because I am the toughest cook in this kitchen.

525
00:41:21,673 --> 00:41:23,334
I've worked too hard for too long to get here

526
00:41:23,441 --> 00:41:26,376
and I am not going to jeopardize it
for some garbage boy who got lucky.

527
00:41:26,478 --> 00:41:27,672
Got it?

528
00:41:31,416 --> 00:41:32,383
Wow!

529
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:37,280
Easy to cook. Easy
to eat. Gusteau makes Chinese food

530
00:41:37,389 --> 00:41:39,414
Chine-easy.

531
00:41:41,393 --> 00:41:45,159
- Excellent work, François, as usual.
- It's good, isn't it?

532
00:41:45,263 --> 00:41:49,495
I want you to work up something
for my latest frozen food concept.

533
00:41:49,601 --> 00:41:51,831
Gusteau's Corn Puppies.

534
00:41:51,936 --> 00:41:56,498
They're like corn dogs, only smaller.
Bite size.

535
00:41:56,608 --> 00:41:57,768
What are corn dogs?

536
00:41:57,876 --> 00:41:58,043
Cheap sausages dipped in batter
and deep fried. You know, American.

537
00:41:58,044 --> 00:42:02,309
Cheap sausages dipped in batter
and deep fried. You know, American.

538
00:42:02,614 --> 00:42:03,740
Whip something up.

539
00:42:03,848 --> 00:42:07,375
Maybe Gusteau in overalls and Huckleberry Tom hat.

540
00:42:07,485 --> 00:42:10,682
Or as a big ear of corn
in doggie make-up.

541
00:42:10,789 --> 00:42:14,691
Yes.
But, please, with dignity.

542
00:42:41,263 --> 00:42:42,491
Get my lawyer!

543
00:42:43,398 --> 00:42:45,491
Well, the will stipulates

544
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:49,366
that if after a period of two years from the date of death

545
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:50,768
no heir appears,

546
00:42:50,872 --> 00:42:55,172
Gusteau's business interests
will pass to his sous chef. You.

547
00:42:55,277 --> 00:42:57,268
I know what the will stipulates.

548
00:42:57,379 --> 00:43:02,646
What I want to know is if this letter...
If this boy changes anything!

549
00:43:06,955 --> 00:43:08,820
There's not much resemblance.

550
00:43:08,924 --> 00:43:12,451
There's no resemblance at all.
He is not Gusteau's son.

551
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,723
Gusteau had no children,
and what of the timing of all this?

552
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:19,095
The deadline in the will expires in less than a month!

553
00:43:19,267 --> 00:43:21,360
Suddenly, some boy arrives with a letter

554
00:43:21,469 --> 00:43:26,429
from his recently deceased mother
claiming Gusteau is his father?

555
00:43:26,541 --> 00:43:28,008
Highly suspect!

556
00:43:28,109 --> 00:43:29,974
- This is Gusteau's?
- Yes, yes, yes.

557
00:43:30,078 --> 00:43:31,670
- May I?
- Of course.

558
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:33,247
But the boy does not know.

559
00:43:33,348 --> 00:43:37,682
She claims she never told him,
or Gusteau, and asks that I not tell.

560
00:43:37,786 --> 00:43:41,779
- Why you? What does she want?
- A job for the boy.

561
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:44,791
- Only a job?
- Well, yes.

562
00:43:44,893 --> 00:43:47,418
Then what are you worried about?
If he works here,

563
00:43:47,529 --> 00:43:50,464
you'll be able to keep an eye on him
while I do a little digging.

564
00:43:50,565 --> 00:43:52,396
Find out how much of this is real.

565
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,060
I will need you to collect some DNA samples

566
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:56,899
from the boy. Hair, maybe.

567
00:43:57,005 --> 00:44:01,271
Mark my words.
The whole thing is highly suspect.

568
00:44:02,077 --> 00:44:04,272
He knows something.

569
00:44:04,379 --> 00:44:08,509
Relax, he's a garbage boy.
I think you can handle him.

570
00:44:14,856 --> 00:44:15,982
What are you doing?

571
00:44:16,091 --> 00:44:18,059
I'm cutting vegetables.
I'm cutting vegetables?

572
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:19,888
No! You waste energy and time!

573
00:44:19,995 --> 00:44:22,987
You think cooking is a cute job,
like Mommy in the kitchen?

574
00:44:23,098 --> 00:44:24,258
Well, Mommy never had to face

575
00:44:24,366 --> 00:44:26,000
the dinner rush when the orders come flooding in,

576
00:44:26,034 --> 00:44:27,467
and every dish is different and none are simple,

577
00:44:27,569 --> 00:44:28,934
and all of the different cooking times,

578
00:44:29,037 --> 00:44:30,337
but must arrive on the customer's table

579
00:44:30,338 --> 00:44:32,431
at exactly the same time, hot and perfect!

580
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:35,202
Every second counts, and you cannot be Mommy!

581
00:44:37,846 --> 00:44:40,974
What is this? Keep your station clear!

582
00:44:41,082 --> 00:44:42,777
When the meal rush comes, what will happen?

583
00:44:42,884 --> 00:44:44,442
Messy stations slow things down.

584
00:44:44,552 --> 00:44:46,850
Food doesn't go, orders pile up.
Disaster.

585
00:44:46,955 --> 00:44:48,650
I'll make this easy to remember.

586
00:44:48,757 --> 00:44:52,249
Keep your station clear, or I will kill you!

587
00:44:54,329 --> 00:44:56,593
Your sleeves look like you threw up on them.

588
00:44:56,698 --> 00:44:59,394
Keep your hands and arms in,
close to the body. Like this. See?

589
00:44:59,501 --> 00:45:00,627
Always return to this position.

590
00:45:00,735 --> 00:45:04,330
Cooks move fast. Sharp utensils,
hot metal, keep your arms in.

591
00:45:04,439 --> 00:45:07,340
You will minimize cuts and burns
and keep your sleeves clean.

592
00:45:07,442 --> 00:45:10,036
Mark of a chef:
Messy apron, clean sleeves.

593
00:45:10,145 --> 00:45:11,874
I know the Gusteau style cold.

594
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:15,279
In every dish, Chef Gusteau
always has something unexpected.

595
00:45:15,383 --> 00:45:18,284
I will show you.
I memorize all his recipe.

596
00:45:18,386 --> 00:45:22,186
- Always do something unexpected.
- No. Follow the recipe.

597
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:23,757
- But you just said that...
- No, no, no.

598
00:45:23,858 --> 00:45:27,157
It was his job to be unexpected.
It is our job to...

599
00:45:27,295 --> 00:45:29,229
- Follow his recipes.
- Follow the recipe.

600
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:31,662
How do you tell how good bread is without tasting it?

601
00:45:31,766 --> 00:45:35,964
Not the smell, not the look, but the sound of the crust.

602
00:45:36,071 --> 00:45:37,038
Listen.

603
00:45:38,473 --> 00:45:42,000
Symphony of crackle.
Only great bread sound this way.

604
00:45:42,377 --> 00:45:45,278
The only way to get the best produce
is to have first pick of the day

605
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:47,314
and there are only two way to get first pick.

606
00:45:47,415 --> 00:45:51,215
Grow it yourself, or bribe a grower.

607
00:45:51,519 --> 00:45:54,079
<i>Voilà! The best restaurant get first pick.</i>

608
00:45:54,189 --> 00:45:58,182
People think haute cuisine is snooty.
So chef must also be snooty.

609
00:45:58,293 --> 00:46:02,161
But not so.
Lalo there ran away from home at 12.

610
00:46:02,263 --> 00:46:04,823
Got hired by circus people as an acrobat.

611
00:46:04,933 --> 00:46:06,423
And then he get fired

612
00:46:06,534 --> 00:46:09,264
for messing around with the ringmaster's daughter.

613
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:11,133
Horst has done time.

614
00:46:11,239 --> 00:46:12,228
What for?

615
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:15,707
No one know for sure. He changes
the story every time you ask him.

616
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:17,744
I defrauded a major corporation.

617
00:46:17,846 --> 00:46:21,338
I robbed the second largest bank
in France using only a ballpoint pen.

618
00:46:21,449 --> 00:46:23,974
I created a hole in the ozone over Avignon.

619
00:46:24,085 --> 00:46:26,781
I killed a man with this thumb.

620
00:46:27,055 --> 00:46:28,989
Don't ever play cards with Pompidou.

621
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:32,651
He's been banned from Las Vegas and Monte Carlo.

622
00:46:33,061 --> 00:46:36,258
- Larousse ran gun for the Resistance.
- Which resistance?

623
00:46:36,364 --> 00:46:39,333
He won't say.
Apparently, they didn't win.

624
00:46:39,734 --> 00:46:40,928
So you see.

625
00:46:41,035 --> 00:46:45,369
We are artist, pirate.
More than cooks are we.

626
00:46:45,473 --> 00:46:48,874
<i>- We?
- Oui. You are one of us now, oui?</i>

627
00:46:49,177 --> 00:46:53,705
<i>Oui. Thank you, by the way,
for all the advice about cooking.</i>

628
00:46:54,082 --> 00:46:56,550
- Thank you, too.
- For what?

629
00:46:56,784 --> 00:46:58,251
For taking it.

630
00:47:00,955 --> 00:47:02,252
Huh?

631
00:47:02,991 --> 00:47:04,185
The rat!

632
00:47:06,394 --> 00:47:09,420
- But he is a...
- I just dropped my keys.

633
00:47:13,101 --> 00:47:14,966
Have you decided this evening?

634
00:47:15,069 --> 00:47:19,130
- Your soup is excellent. But...
- But we order it every time.

635
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:22,801
- What else do you have?
- Well, we have a very nice foie gras.

636
00:47:22,911 --> 00:47:23,969
I know about the foie gras.

637
00:47:24,078 --> 00:47:25,875
The old standby, used to be famous for it.

638
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,107
What does the chef have that's new?

639
00:47:30,051 --> 00:47:31,678
- Someone has asked what is new!
- New?

640
00:47:31,786 --> 00:47:32,775
Yes. What do I tell them?

641
00:47:32,887 --> 00:47:34,582
- Well, what did you tell them?
- I told them I would ask!

642
00:47:34,689 --> 00:47:35,986
What are you blathering about?

643
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:38,183
- Customers are asking what is new.
- What should I tell them?

644
00:47:38,293 --> 00:47:40,761
- What did you tell them?
- I told them I would ask!

645
00:47:42,363 --> 00:47:43,694
This is simple.

646
00:47:43,798 --> 00:47:45,925
Just pull out an old Gusteau recipe,

647
00:47:46,034 --> 00:47:47,695
something we haven't made in a while...

648
00:47:47,802 --> 00:47:51,568
They know about the old stuff.
They like Linguini's soup.

649
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:57,270
They are asking for food from Linguini?

650
00:47:57,712 --> 00:48:00,180
A lot of customers like the soup.
That's all we are saying.

651
00:48:00,281 --> 00:48:01,839
Were we saying that?

652
00:48:02,684 --> 00:48:05,619
Very well. If it's Linguini they want

653
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:10,282
tell them Chef Linguini has prepared
something special for them.

654
00:48:10,391 --> 00:48:13,485
Something definitely off menu.

655
00:48:13,895 --> 00:48:15,487
Oh, and don't forget to stress

656
00:48:15,597 --> 00:48:18,065
<i>- its Linguini-ness.
- Oui, chef.</i>

657
00:48:18,166 --> 00:48:22,330
Now is your chance to try something
worthy of your talent, Linguini.

658
00:48:22,437 --> 00:48:27,739
A forgotten favorite of the chef's,
sweetbread à la Gusteau.

659
00:48:27,842 --> 00:48:29,469
<i>- Colette will help you.
- Oui, chef.</i>

660
00:48:29,577 --> 00:48:32,444
Now, hurry up. Our diners are hungry.

661
00:48:32,914 --> 00:48:35,348
Are you sure?
That recipe was a disaster.

662
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:37,179
Gusteau himself said so.

663
00:48:37,285 --> 00:48:40,652
Just the sort of challenge a budding chef needs.

664
00:48:40,989 --> 00:48:42,320
"Sweetbread à la Gusteau.

665
00:48:42,423 --> 00:48:44,914
"Sweetbread cooked in a seaweed salt crust

666
00:48:45,026 --> 00:48:47,961
"with cuttlefish tentacle, dog rose purée,

667
00:48:48,062 --> 00:48:50,587
"geoduck egg, dried white fungus?

668
00:48:50,698 --> 00:48:53,462
"Anchovy licorice sauce."

669
00:48:53,801 --> 00:48:56,929
I don't know this recipe, but it's Gusteau's, so...

670
00:48:57,038 --> 00:48:59,563
Lalo! We have
some veal stomach soaking, yes?

671
00:48:59,674 --> 00:49:01,665
Yes!
The veal stomach, I get that.

672
00:49:01,776 --> 00:49:02,970
Veal stomach?

673
00:49:10,418 --> 00:49:11,510
Oh!

674
00:49:11,619 --> 00:49:12,677
Okay.

675
00:49:20,695 --> 00:49:23,095
I'll be right back. Where...

676
00:49:24,499 --> 00:49:26,399
Hey, I got to... Hey!

677
00:49:26,734 --> 00:49:30,761
Don't mind me.
I just need to borrow this real quick.

678
00:49:30,972 --> 00:49:33,065
Let's see, over here...

679
00:49:33,174 --> 00:49:34,436
I'll be back.

680
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:36,668
Thank you.

681
00:49:37,578 --> 00:49:39,045
Excuse me. I'm going to...

682
00:49:39,147 --> 00:49:41,741
Apparently, I need this. I'll be right...

683
00:49:41,883 --> 00:49:43,544
I'm going to pick that up.

684
00:49:43,651 --> 00:49:45,846
I got some of that spice.

685
00:49:46,754 --> 00:49:47,948
Okay.

686
00:49:48,189 --> 00:49:49,356
What are you doing? You're supposed

687
00:49:49,424 --> 00:49:50,721
to be preparing the Gusteau recipe.

688
00:49:50,825 --> 00:49:52,156
This is the recipe.

689
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:54,319
The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil!

690
00:49:54,429 --> 00:49:56,954
What else have you...
You are improvising?

691
00:49:57,065 --> 00:49:59,499
This is no time to experiment.
The customer are waiting.

692
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,830
You're right. I should listen to you!

693
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:04,135
- Stop that!
- Stop what?

694
00:50:04,238 --> 00:50:06,798
Freaking me out!
Whatever you are doing, stop it.

695
00:50:06,908 --> 00:50:08,933
- Where is the special order?
- Coming!

696
00:50:09,043 --> 00:50:11,307
- I thought we were together on this.
- We are together.

697
00:50:11,412 --> 00:50:14,074
- Then what are you doing?
- It's very hard to explain.

698
00:50:14,182 --> 00:50:16,480
- The special?
- Come get it!

699
00:50:18,586 --> 00:50:21,248
Whoa, whoa.
I forgot the anchovy licorice sauce.

700
00:50:26,561 --> 00:50:30,657
- Don't you dare.
- I'm not, I'm not. I'm...

701
00:50:33,768 --> 00:50:34,860
Sorry.

702
00:50:36,804 --> 00:50:39,364
Is Linguini's dish done yet?

703
00:50:39,474 --> 00:50:42,500
<i>Ja. It's as bad as we remember.
Just went out.</i>

704
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:46,205
<i>- Did you taste it?
- Ja, of course, before he changed it.</i>

705
00:50:46,314 --> 00:50:49,112
Good. What? How could he change it?

706
00:50:49,217 --> 00:50:51,310
He changed it as it was going out the door!

707
00:50:51,419 --> 00:50:52,408
Ow!

708
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,487
They love it!

709
00:50:53,588 --> 00:50:56,318
Other diners are already asking about it, about Linguini.

710
00:50:56,424 --> 00:50:58,187
I have seven more orders!

711
00:50:58,292 --> 00:51:00,920
That's wonderful.

712
00:51:05,633 --> 00:51:06,759
I'd like one of those.

713
00:51:09,303 --> 00:51:10,793
Special order!

714
00:51:14,675 --> 00:51:15,642
What is that?

715
00:51:15,743 --> 00:51:19,042
Special order! Special order!
Special order!

716
00:51:27,388 --> 00:51:28,821
To Linguini.

717
00:51:28,923 --> 00:51:31,483
<i>- Congratulations, Mr. Linguini.
- Cheers, ja?</i>

718
00:51:31,993 --> 00:51:33,961
Drink now, there's plenty.

719
00:51:38,332 --> 00:51:40,698
Take a break, Little Chef. Get some air.

720
00:51:41,769 --> 00:51:43,760
We really did it tonight.

721
00:51:48,643 --> 00:51:49,974
Dah!

722
00:51:53,714 --> 00:51:55,306
Got your toque!

723
00:51:56,317 --> 00:51:57,682
Oh, seriously now.

724
00:51:57,885 --> 00:52:02,515
I'd love to have a little talk with you,
Linguini, in my office.

725
00:52:02,623 --> 00:52:05,285
- Am I in trouble?
- Trouble? No.

726
00:52:05,393 --> 00:52:09,193
A little wine, a friendly chat.
Just us cooks.

727
00:52:10,798 --> 00:52:14,290
<i>The plongeur won't be coming to you
for advice anymore, eh, Colette?</i>

728
00:52:14,402 --> 00:52:17,132
He's gotten all he needs.

729
00:52:19,907 --> 00:52:22,774
Toasting your success, eh, Linguini?

730
00:52:24,278 --> 00:52:25,802
Good for you.

731
00:52:25,913 --> 00:52:29,906
I just took it to be polite.
I don't really drink, you know.

732
00:52:30,017 --> 00:52:34,113
Of course you don't.
I wouldn't either if I was drinking that.

733
00:52:34,222 --> 00:52:38,420
But you would have to be an idiot
of elephantine proportions

734
00:52:38,526 --> 00:52:42,553
not to appreciate this '61 Château Latour.

735
00:52:42,763 --> 00:52:46,824
<i>And you, Monsieur Linguini, are no idiot.</i>

736
00:52:47,768 --> 00:52:50,635
Let us toast your non-idiocy.

737
00:53:14,462 --> 00:53:16,327
- Remy!
- Emile?

738
00:53:16,697 --> 00:53:18,562
I can't believe it! You're alive!

739
00:53:18,666 --> 00:53:20,224
- You made it!
- I thought I'd never see you guys again!

740
00:53:20,334 --> 00:53:22,268
We figured you didn't survive the rapids.

741
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:24,531
And what are you eating?

742
00:53:27,408 --> 00:53:29,171
I don't really know.

743
00:53:29,277 --> 00:53:32,474
I think it was some sort of wrapper once.

744
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:37,279
What? No.
You're in Paris now, baby. My town.

745
00:53:37,385 --> 00:53:40,877
No brother of mine eats rejectamenta in my town.

746
00:53:50,398 --> 00:53:53,765
Remy! You are stealing?
You told Linguini he could trust you.

747
00:53:53,868 --> 00:53:58,134
- And he can. It's for my brother.
- But the boy could lose his job.

748
00:53:58,239 --> 00:54:01,402
Which means I would, too.
It's under control, okay?

749
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:06,269
- More wine?
- I shouldn't, but... Okay.

750
00:54:06,647 --> 00:54:09,980
So, where did you train, Linguini?

751
00:54:10,084 --> 00:54:12,382
Train? All right.

752
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:17,114
Surely you don't expect me to believe
this is your first time cooking?

753
00:54:17,224 --> 00:54:18,555
- It's not.
- I knew it!

754
00:54:18,659 --> 00:54:22,390
It's my... Second, third, fourth...
Fifth time.

755
00:54:22,496 --> 00:54:24,088
Monday was my first time.

756
00:54:24,198 --> 00:54:26,962
But I've taken out the garbage
lots of times before that...

757
00:54:27,068 --> 00:54:29,332
Yes, yes. Have some more wine.

758
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:32,667
Tell me, Linguini, about your interests.

759
00:54:32,773 --> 00:54:34,798
Do you like animals?

760
00:54:34,909 --> 00:54:37,639
What? Animals? What kind?

761
00:54:38,479 --> 00:54:42,279
The usual, dogs, cats, horses, guinea pigs,

762
00:54:42,383 --> 00:54:43,543
rats.

763
00:54:45,052 --> 00:54:46,144
I brought you something to...

764
00:54:47,321 --> 00:54:48,345
No, no, no, no!

765
00:54:48,456 --> 00:54:50,117
Spit that out right now!

766
00:54:51,058 --> 00:54:54,186
I have got to teach you about food.
Close your eyes.

767
00:54:54,695 --> 00:54:59,098
Now take a bite of... No! No! No!

768
00:54:59,233 --> 00:55:02,600
- Don't just hork it down!
- Too late.

769
00:55:02,837 --> 00:55:04,099
Here.

770
00:55:04,405 --> 00:55:08,774
Chew it slowly.
Only think about the taste.

771
00:55:11,312 --> 00:55:13,337
- See?
- Not really.

772
00:55:13,447 --> 00:55:16,678
Creamy, salty sweet, an oaky nuttiness.

773
00:55:16,784 --> 00:55:19,810
- You detect that?
- Oh, I'm detecting nuttiness.

774
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,014
Close your eyes. Now taste this.

775
00:55:23,491 --> 00:55:28,554
Whole different thing, right?
Sweet, crisp, slight tang on the finish.

776
00:55:28,663 --> 00:55:32,258
- Okay.
- Now, try them together.

777
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,360
Okay.

778
00:55:34,835 --> 00:55:38,293
I think I'm getting a little something there.

779
00:55:38,506 --> 00:55:40,497
- It might be the nuttiness.
- See?

780
00:55:40,608 --> 00:55:42,337
- Could be the tang.
- That's it.

781
00:55:42,443 --> 00:55:44,274
Now, imagine every great taste in the world

782
00:55:44,378 --> 00:55:46,346
being combined into infinite combinations.

783
00:55:46,447 --> 00:55:49,507
Tastes that no one has tried yet!
Discoveries to be made!

784
00:55:49,617 --> 00:55:50,982
I think...

785
00:55:52,153 --> 00:55:54,678
- You lost me again.
- Yeah.

786
00:55:54,789 --> 00:55:56,256
But that was interesting.

787
00:55:56,357 --> 00:55:59,121
Most interesting garbage I ever...
Hey! What are we doing?

788
00:55:59,226 --> 00:56:00,591
Dad doesn't know you're alive yet!

789
00:56:00,695 --> 00:56:02,993
We've got to go to the colony!
Everyone will be thrilled!

790
00:56:03,097 --> 00:56:04,655
- Yeah! But...
- What?

791
00:56:04,765 --> 00:56:07,700
Thing is, I kind of have to...

792
00:56:08,235 --> 00:56:10,226
What do you "have to" more than family?

793
00:56:10,337 --> 00:56:11,634
What's more important here?

794
00:56:11,739 --> 00:56:13,331
Well, I...

795
00:56:14,809 --> 00:56:16,800
It wouldn't hurt to visit.

796
00:56:17,078 --> 00:56:18,739
- Have you had a pet rat?
- No.

797
00:56:18,846 --> 00:56:20,711
- Did you work in a lab with rats?
- No.

798
00:56:20,815 --> 00:56:22,305
Perhaps you lived in squalor at some point?

799
00:56:22,416 --> 00:56:24,008
Nopety nopety no.

800
00:56:24,118 --> 00:56:26,780
You know something about rats!
You know you do!

801
00:56:26,887 --> 00:56:30,220
You know who know do whacka-doo.
Ratta-tatta.

802
00:56:30,324 --> 00:56:32,724
- Hey! Why do they call it that?
- What?

803
00:56:32,827 --> 00:56:36,923
Ratatouille. It's like a stew, right?
Why do they call it that?

804
00:56:37,264 --> 00:56:38,595
If you're going to name a food,

805
00:56:38,699 --> 00:56:41,634
you should give it a name that sounds delicious.

806
00:56:41,769 --> 00:56:47,002
Ratatouille doesn't sound delicious.
It sounds like "rat" and "patootie."

807
00:56:47,174 --> 00:56:51,338
Rat patootie.
Which does not sound delicious.

808
00:56:53,347 --> 00:56:58,719
Regrettably we are all out of wine.

809
00:57:01,589 --> 00:57:03,557
My son has returned!

810
00:57:27,448 --> 00:57:33,045
And finding someone to replace you
for poison checker has been a disaster.

811
00:57:33,154 --> 00:57:36,988
Nothing's been poisoned, thank God,
but it hasn't been easy.

812
00:57:37,191 --> 00:57:41,594
- You didn't make it easy.
- I know. I am sorry, Dad.

813
00:57:41,695 --> 00:57:45,222
Well, the important thing is that you're home.

814
00:57:45,332 --> 00:57:48,392
Yeah, well, about that...

815
00:57:48,502 --> 00:57:50,299
You look thin. Why is that?

816
00:57:50,404 --> 00:57:53,896
A shortage of food, or a surplus of snobbery?

817
00:57:56,577 --> 00:57:59,603
It's tough out there in the big world all alone, isn't it?

818
00:57:59,713 --> 00:58:02,773
Sure, but it's not like I'm a kid anymore.

819
00:58:02,883 --> 00:58:05,545
- Hey. Hey, boy. What's up?
- I can take care of myself.

820
00:58:05,653 --> 00:58:09,487
I've found a nice spot not far away,
so I'll be able to visit often.

821
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:13,126
Nothing like a cold splash of reality to make you...

822
00:58:13,227 --> 00:58:16,025
- Visit?
- I will. I promise. Often.

823
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:21,067
- You're not staying?
- No. It's not a big deal, Dad. I just...

824
00:58:21,168 --> 00:58:23,796
You didn't think I was going to stay forever, did you?

825
00:58:23,904 --> 00:58:26,134
Eventually, a bird's got to leave the nest.

826
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:28,504
We're not birds. We're rats.

827
00:58:28,609 --> 00:58:31,544
We don't leave our nests.
We make them bigger.

828
00:58:31,645 --> 00:58:34,637
- Well, maybe I'm a different kind of rat.
- Maybe you're not a rat at all.

829
00:58:34,748 --> 00:58:35,772
Maybe that's a good thing.

830
00:58:35,883 --> 00:58:38,317
Hey! The band's
really on tonight, huh?

831
00:58:38,419 --> 00:58:40,649
Rats. All we do is take, Dad.

832
00:58:40,754 --> 00:58:43,245
I'm tired of taking.
I want to make things.

833
00:58:43,357 --> 00:58:45,416
I want to add something to this world.

834
00:58:45,526 --> 00:58:48,620
- You're talking like a human.
- Who are not as bad as you say.

835
00:58:48,729 --> 00:58:51,391
- Oh, yeah? What makes you so sure?
- Oh, man.

836
00:58:51,498 --> 00:58:55,195
I've been able to observe them

837
00:58:55,302 --> 00:58:58,237
at a close-ish sort of range.

838
00:58:58,339 --> 00:59:00,603
- Yeah? How close?
- Close enough.

839
00:59:00,708 --> 00:59:04,337
And they're, you know, not so bad as you say they are.

840
00:59:05,713 --> 00:59:08,773
Come with me.
I got something I want you to see.

841
00:59:10,384 --> 00:59:12,818
You know, I'm going to stay here.

842
00:59:13,587 --> 00:59:17,079
Make sure the floors and countertops
are clean before you lock up.

843
00:59:17,191 --> 00:59:20,354
Wait. You want me to stay and clean?

844
00:59:20,461 --> 00:59:22,361
Is that a problem?

845
00:59:22,596 --> 00:59:26,157
- No.
- Good boy. See you tomorrow.

846
00:59:33,674 --> 00:59:34,868
We're here.

847
00:59:45,085 --> 00:59:47,553
Take a good long look, Remy.

848
00:59:49,189 --> 00:59:50,349
Now, this is what happens

849
00:59:50,457 --> 00:59:53,984
when a rat gets a little too comfortable around humans.

850
00:59:54,962 --> 00:59:58,420
The world we live in belongs to the enemy.

851
00:59:59,667 --> 01:00:01,794
We must live carefully.

852
01:00:03,237 --> 01:00:05,967
We look out for our own kind, Remy.

853
01:00:06,473 --> 01:00:10,068
When all is said and done, we're all we've got.

854
01:00:14,949 --> 01:00:17,349
- No.
- What?

855
01:00:18,152 --> 01:00:24,352
No. Dad, I don't believe it.
You're telling me that the future is...

856
01:00:24,558 --> 01:00:27,527
Can only be more of this?

857
01:00:27,728 --> 01:00:32,927
This is the way things are.
You can't change nature.

858
01:00:33,133 --> 01:00:38,298
Change is nature, Dad.
The part that we can influence.

859
01:00:38,739 --> 01:00:41,936
And it starts when we decide.

860
01:00:42,543 --> 01:00:46,775
- Where you going?
- With luck, forward.

861
01:01:10,671 --> 01:01:12,036
Hey! Yeah.

862
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:11,290
Stop it.

863
01:02:45,666 --> 01:02:46,894
Good morning.

864
01:02:49,103 --> 01:02:50,570
Good morning.

865
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:56,139
So, the chef, he invited you in for a drink?

866
01:02:56,243 --> 01:02:57,767
That's big.

867
01:02:57,878 --> 01:03:00,676
That's big. What did he say?

868
01:03:05,219 --> 01:03:06,186
What?

869
01:03:07,121 --> 01:03:08,782
What, you can't tell me?

870
01:03:09,523 --> 01:03:10,751
Oh!

871
01:03:10,858 --> 01:03:15,557
Forgive me for intruding on your deep,
personal relationship with the chef.

872
01:03:15,662 --> 01:03:17,027
Oh, I see how it is.

873
01:03:17,131 --> 01:03:19,759
You get me to teach you a few kitchen tricks

874
01:03:19,867 --> 01:03:22,597
to dazzle the boss and then you blow past me?

875
01:03:22,703 --> 01:03:24,170
Wake up. Wake up.

876
01:03:25,506 --> 01:03:28,270
I thought you were different.

877
01:03:29,676 --> 01:03:32,042
I thought you thought I was different.

878
01:03:32,513 --> 01:03:33,810
I thought...

879
01:03:37,518 --> 01:03:39,042
I didn't have to help you!

880
01:03:39,153 --> 01:03:42,486
If I looked out only for myself,
I would have let you drown!

881
01:03:42,589 --> 01:03:43,681
But...

882
01:03:44,591 --> 01:03:49,187
I wanted you to succeed. I liked you.

883
01:03:51,165 --> 01:03:52,462
My mistake.

884
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:56,499
Colette. Wait, wait. Colette!

885
01:03:56,703 --> 01:03:59,638
It's over, Little Chef.
I can't do it anymore.

886
01:04:00,007 --> 01:04:03,704
Colette! Wait, wait!
Don't motorcycle away.

887
01:04:03,810 --> 01:04:07,143
Look, I'm no good with words.
I'm no good with food either.

888
01:04:07,247 --> 01:04:08,976
At least not without your help.

889
01:04:09,082 --> 01:04:12,483
I hate false modesty.
It's just another way to lie.

890
01:04:12,953 --> 01:04:16,753
- You have talent.
- No, but I don't! Really! It's not me.

891
01:04:17,224 --> 01:04:18,953
When I added that extra ingredient

892
01:04:19,059 --> 01:04:21,892
instead of following the recipe like you said,

893
01:04:21,995 --> 01:04:24,190
that wasn't me either.

894
01:04:24,298 --> 01:04:27,199
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I wouldn't have done that.

895
01:04:27,301 --> 01:04:29,098
I would've followed the recipe.

896
01:04:29,203 --> 01:04:30,568
I would've followed your advice.

897
01:04:30,671 --> 01:04:32,571
I would've followed your advice to the ends of the earth.

898
01:04:32,606 --> 01:04:36,770
- Because I love your advice.
- But...

899
01:04:36,877 --> 01:04:38,538
But I...

900
01:04:38,912 --> 01:04:40,209
Don't do it.

901
01:04:40,314 --> 01:04:43,613
I have a secret. It's sort of disturbing.

902
01:04:45,986 --> 01:04:48,887
- I have a...
- What? You...

903
01:04:48,989 --> 01:04:53,187
- I have a ra...
- You have a rash?

904
01:04:53,327 --> 01:04:58,594
No, no, no. I have this...
This tiny little...

905
01:04:58,799 --> 01:04:59,959
Little...

906
01:05:01,001 --> 01:05:03,162
A tiny chef who tells me what to do.

907
01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:05,261
A tiny chef?

908
01:05:05,372 --> 01:05:07,897
Yes. Yes. He's...

909
01:05:09,743 --> 01:05:12,871
- He's up here.
- In your brain?

910
01:05:14,581 --> 01:05:18,347
Why is it so hard to talk to you?
Okay. Here we go.

911
01:05:19,486 --> 01:05:23,388
You inspire me. I'm going to risk it all.

912
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:28,357
I'm going to risk looking like the
biggest idiot psycho you've ever seen.

913
01:05:28,462 --> 01:05:30,657
You want to know why I'm such a fast learner?

914
01:05:30,764 --> 01:05:32,789
You want to know why I'm such a great cook?

915
01:05:32,899 --> 01:05:35,629
Don't laugh! I'm going to show you!

916
01:05:39,172 --> 01:05:40,298
No! No!

917
01:06:25,552 --> 01:06:28,077
- What is it, Ambrister?
- Gusteau's.

918
01:06:28,188 --> 01:06:31,089
- Finally closing, is it?
- No.

919
01:06:31,191 --> 01:06:34,285
- More financial trouble?
- No, it's...

920
01:06:34,394 --> 01:06:36,919
Announced a new line of microwave egg rolls?

921
01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:38,861
What? What? Spit it out.

922
01:06:38,965 --> 01:06:42,401
It's come back. It's popular.

923
01:06:46,707 --> 01:06:50,336
- I haven't reviewed Gusteau's in years.
- No, sir.

924
01:06:50,444 --> 01:06:51,536
My last review condemned it

925
01:06:51,645 --> 01:06:53,169
- to the tourist trade.
- Yes, sir.

926
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:57,478
I said, "Gusteau has finally
found his rightful place in history

927
01:06:57,584 --> 01:07:01,350
"right alongside another equally famous chef,

928
01:07:01,455 --> 01:07:03,218
<i>"Monsieur Boyardee."</i>

929
01:07:03,323 --> 01:07:04,312
Touché.

930
01:07:04,424 --> 01:07:07,791
That is where I left it.
That was my last word.

931
01:07:07,961 --> 01:07:10,930
- The last word.
- Yes.

932
01:07:11,031 --> 01:07:13,329
Then tell me, Ambrister,

933
01:07:14,267 --> 01:07:18,203
how could it be popular?

934
01:07:19,139 --> 01:07:23,701
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

935
01:07:23,810 --> 01:07:26,938
The DNA matches, the timing works, everything checks out.

936
01:07:27,047 --> 01:07:28,275
He is Gusteau's son.

937
01:07:28,382 --> 01:07:32,284
This can't just happen!
The whole thing is a setup!

938
01:07:32,386 --> 01:07:33,717
The boy knows!

939
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:36,812
Look at him out there, pretending to be an idiot.

940
01:07:36,923 --> 01:07:41,326
He's toying with my mind
like a cat with a ball of... Something.

941
01:07:41,428 --> 01:07:43,862
- String?
- Yes! Playing dumb.

942
01:07:43,964 --> 01:07:46,023
- Taunting me with that rat.
- Rat?

943
01:07:46,133 --> 01:07:47,828
Yes. He's consorting with it.

944
01:07:47,934 --> 01:07:50,459
Deliberately trying to make me think it's important.

945
01:07:50,570 --> 01:07:53,061
- The rat.
- Exactly!

946
01:07:54,374 --> 01:07:56,968
Is the rat important?

947
01:07:57,210 --> 01:08:00,441
Of course not!
He just wants me to think that it is.

948
01:08:00,547 --> 01:08:02,811
Oh, I see the theatricality of it.

949
01:08:02,916 --> 01:08:05,578
A rat appears on the boy's first night,
I order him to kill it.

950
01:08:05,685 --> 01:08:08,210
And now he wants me to see it everywhere.

951
01:08:08,321 --> 01:08:10,152
Ooh!

952
01:08:10,257 --> 01:08:12,316
It's here! No, it isn't, it's here!

953
01:08:12,426 --> 01:08:15,657
Am I seeing things, am I crazy?
Is there a phantom rat or is there not?

954
01:08:15,762 --> 01:08:16,854
But, oh, no!

955
01:08:16,963 --> 01:08:21,161
I refuse to be sucked into his little game of...

956
01:08:24,371 --> 01:08:29,866
Should I be concerned about this?
About you?

957
01:08:37,050 --> 01:08:38,017
Huh?

958
01:08:49,796 --> 01:08:51,696
I can't fire him. He's getting attention.

959
01:08:51,798 --> 01:08:54,164
If I fire him now, everyone will wonder why.

960
01:08:54,267 --> 01:08:56,735
And the last thing I want is people looking into this.

961
01:08:56,837 --> 01:08:58,464
What are you so worried about?

962
01:08:58,572 --> 01:08:59,800
Isn't it good to have the press?

963
01:08:59,906 --> 01:09:02,534
Isn't it good to have Gusteau's name getting headlines?

964
01:09:02,642 --> 01:09:05,042
Not if they're over his face!

965
01:09:05,579 --> 01:09:09,242
Gusteau's already has a face,
and it's fat and lovable and familiar.

966
01:09:09,349 --> 01:09:14,309
And it sells burritos!
Millions and millions of burritos!

967
01:09:14,421 --> 01:09:16,389
The deadline passes in three days.

968
01:09:16,490 --> 01:09:19,425
Then you can fire him whenever he ceases to be valuable

969
01:09:19,526 --> 01:09:21,653
and no one will ever know.

970
01:09:22,195 --> 01:09:24,629
I was worried about the hair sample you gave me.

971
01:09:24,731 --> 01:09:27,165
- I had to send them back to the lab.
- Why?

972
01:09:27,267 --> 01:09:31,795
Because the first time it came back
identified as rodent hair.

973
01:09:37,511 --> 01:09:38,739
- No, no, no.
- What?

974
01:09:38,845 --> 01:09:41,143
Try this. It's better.

975
01:09:55,228 --> 01:09:57,355
Well, because you...

976
01:09:58,431 --> 01:09:59,420
Whoa!

977
01:10:21,621 --> 01:10:22,588
Rat!

978
01:10:29,129 --> 01:10:31,359
Disgusting little creatures.

979
01:10:41,241 --> 01:10:44,176
<i>I was reminded how fragile it all was.</i>

980
01:10:45,078 --> 01:10:47,205
<i>How the world really saw me.</i>

981
01:10:48,748 --> 01:10:51,979
<i>And it just kept getting better.</i>

982
01:10:52,219 --> 01:10:52,719
Remy!

983
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:53,651
Remy!

984
01:10:53,753 --> 01:10:55,015
Psst! Psst!

985
01:10:57,190 --> 01:10:59,590
Hey, hey, hey, little brother!

986
01:10:59,793 --> 01:11:03,320
We were afraid you weren't going to, you know, show up.

987
01:11:03,530 --> 01:11:07,330
- Hey, Remy! How you doing?
- You told them?

988
01:11:07,434 --> 01:11:10,301
Emile, that's exactly what I said not to do!

989
01:11:10,403 --> 01:11:12,166
But you know these guys.
They're my friends.

990
01:11:12,272 --> 01:11:13,364
I didn't think you meant them.

991
01:11:13,473 --> 01:11:15,566
Look, I'm sorry.

992
01:11:15,675 --> 01:11:18,143
Don't tell me you're sorry, tell them you're sorry.

993
01:11:18,244 --> 01:11:22,806
- Is there a problem over here?
- No, there is not.

994
01:11:22,916 --> 01:11:24,213
Wait here.

995
01:11:30,090 --> 01:11:31,352
It's locked?

996
01:11:32,792 --> 01:11:33,781
Hmm...

997
01:11:38,398 --> 01:11:40,195
Remy, what are you doing in here?

998
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:43,098
Okay. Emile shows up with...

999
01:11:43,203 --> 01:11:47,139
Okay, I said not to. I told him...
He goes and blabs to...

1000
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:49,399
Yeah, it's a disaster.

1001
01:11:49,509 --> 01:11:53,138
Anyway, they're hungry, the food safe
is locked and I need the key.

1002
01:11:53,246 --> 01:11:57,149
- They want you to steal food?
- Yes. No! It's...

1003
01:11:57,150 --> 01:11:57,445
- They want you to steal food?
- Yes. No! It's...

1004
01:11:57,550 --> 01:12:01,350
It's complicated. It's family.
They don't have your ideals.

1005
01:12:01,454 --> 01:12:04,082
Ideals?
If Chef Fancy Pants had any ideals,

1006
01:12:04,190 --> 01:12:06,249
you think I'd be hawking barbecue over here?

1007
01:12:06,359 --> 01:12:07,417
Or microwave burritos?

1008
01:12:07,527 --> 01:12:09,586
Or, Tooth, I say, Tooth Pick'n Chicken?

1009
01:12:09,696 --> 01:12:11,459
About as French as a corn dog!

1010
01:12:11,665 --> 01:12:12,689
Coming soon!

1011
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:14,699
We're inventing new ways to sell out over here.

1012
01:12:14,801 --> 01:12:16,393
Will ye be wanting some haggis bites?

1013
01:12:16,503 --> 01:12:18,164
I cannot control how they use my image, Remy.

1014
01:12:18,271 --> 01:12:20,671
- I am dead!
- Can you guys shut up?

1015
01:12:21,741 --> 01:12:25,802
I've got to think! Word's getting out.
If I can't keep them quiet,

1016
01:12:25,912 --> 01:12:29,177
the entire clan's gonna be after me
with their mouths open and...

1017
01:12:29,282 --> 01:12:30,306
Here it is.

1018
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:33,048
Hey. Your will!

1019
01:12:33,153 --> 01:12:37,783
- Oh, this is interesting. Mind if I...
- Not at all.

1020
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:41,825
Linguini?

1021
01:12:42,662 --> 01:12:45,392
Why would Linguini be filed with your will?

1022
01:12:45,498 --> 01:12:47,329
This used to be my office.

1023
01:13:10,623 --> 01:13:12,090
He's your son?

1024
01:13:12,192 --> 01:13:15,059
- I have a son?
- How could you not know this?

1025
01:13:15,161 --> 01:13:19,154
I am a figment of your imagination.
You did not know, how could I?

1026
01:13:19,265 --> 01:13:20,065
Well, your son is the rightful owner of this restaurant!

1027
01:13:20,066 --> 01:13:22,967
Well, your son is the rightful owner of this restaurant!

1028
01:13:24,370 --> 01:13:26,039
No! No! The rat!

1029
01:13:32,112 --> 01:13:34,910
- Sorry, chef.
- The rat! It's stolen my documents!

1030
01:13:35,014 --> 01:13:37,380
- It's getting away!
- Hey, Mr. Chef!

1031
01:15:11,711 --> 01:15:13,303
You!

1032
01:15:13,413 --> 01:15:18,077
- Get out of my office.
- He's not in your office. You are in his.

1033
01:15:21,321 --> 01:15:23,289
Bottoms up, Linguini!

1034
01:15:25,892 --> 01:15:27,154
<i>Cheers, ja.</i>

1035
01:16:34,394 --> 01:16:36,692
- Chef! Chef!
- Chef Linguini!

1036
01:16:37,897 --> 01:16:40,957
Your rise has been meteoric,
yet you have no formal training.

1037
01:16:41,067 --> 01:16:42,500
What is the secret to your genius?

1038
01:16:42,602 --> 01:16:46,197
Secret? You want the truth?

1039
01:16:46,873 --> 01:16:52,334
I am Gusteau's son.
It's in my blood I guess.

1040
01:16:52,445 --> 01:16:54,845
But you weren't aware of that fact until very recently.

1041
01:16:54,881 --> 01:16:55,848
No.

1042
01:16:55,949 --> 01:16:58,713
And it resulted in
your taking ownership of this restaurant.

1043
01:16:58,818 --> 01:17:00,308
How did you find out?

1044
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:03,685
Well, some part of me just knew.

1045
01:17:04,223 --> 01:17:05,554
The Gusteau part?

1046
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:11,590
- Where do you get your inspiration?
- Inspiration has many names.

1047
01:17:11,798 --> 01:17:14,426
- Mine is named Colette.
- What?

1048
01:17:16,035 --> 01:17:18,094
Something's stuck in my teeth.

1049
01:17:21,607 --> 01:17:22,904
Health Inspector.

1050
01:17:23,009 --> 01:17:25,637
I wish to report a rat infestation.

1051
01:17:25,845 --> 01:17:26,937
It's taken over my...

1052
01:17:27,046 --> 01:17:29,412
Gusteau's restaurant.

1053
01:17:29,515 --> 01:17:30,573
<i>Gusteau's, eh?</i>

1054
01:17:30,717 --> 01:17:34,881
I can drop by. Let's see.
First opening is three months.

1055
01:17:34,988 --> 01:17:37,081
<i>It must happen now!
It's a gourmet restaurant!</i>

1056
01:17:37,190 --> 01:17:40,057
<i>Monsieur, I have the information.
If someone cancels, I'll slot you in.</i>

1057
01:17:40,159 --> 01:17:42,252
But the rat!
You must...

1058
01:17:43,930 --> 01:17:45,830
It stole my documents.

1059
01:17:47,033 --> 01:17:48,591
It's past opening time.

1060
01:17:48,701 --> 01:17:51,135
He should have finished an hour ago.

1061
01:17:53,039 --> 01:17:55,269
<i>Bonjour, ma chérie.
Join us.</i>

1062
01:17:55,375 --> 01:17:57,502
We were just talking about my inspiration.

1063
01:17:57,710 --> 01:18:00,008
Yes, he calls it his tiny chef.

1064
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:03,680
Not that, dearest. I meant you.

1065
01:18:06,319 --> 01:18:08,048
- It's him.
- Ego?

1066
01:18:08,154 --> 01:18:09,121
Anton Ego!

1067
01:18:09,322 --> 01:18:10,584
Is that Ego?

1068
01:18:11,357 --> 01:18:12,790
I can't believe it.

1069
01:18:12,959 --> 01:18:16,224
<i>- You are Monsieur Linguini?
- Hello.</i>

1070
01:18:16,329 --> 01:18:20,823
Pardon me for interrupting your premature celebration,

1071
01:18:20,933 --> 01:18:24,630
but I thought it only fair to give you a sporting chance

1072
01:18:24,737 --> 01:18:26,898
as you are new to this game.

1073
01:18:28,174 --> 01:18:29,436
- Game?
- Yes.

1074
01:18:29,542 --> 01:18:32,602
And you've been playing without an opponent.

1075
01:18:32,712 --> 01:18:37,843
Which is, as you may have guessed, against the rules.

1076
01:18:38,051 --> 01:18:40,110
You're Anton Ego.

1077
01:18:41,687 --> 01:18:44,588
You're slow for someone in the fast lane.

1078
01:18:46,192 --> 01:18:49,161
And you're thin for someone who likes food.

1079
01:18:52,765 --> 01:18:56,792
I don't like food. I love it.

1080
01:18:57,236 --> 01:19:01,468
If I don't love it, I don't swallow.

1081
01:19:02,842 --> 01:19:06,801
I will return tomorrow night with high expectations.

1082
01:19:07,246 --> 01:19:10,044
Pray you don't disappoint me.

1083
01:19:17,356 --> 01:19:20,792
Listen, we hate to be rude,
but we're French, and it's dinnertime.

1084
01:19:20,893 --> 01:19:24,021
She meant to say,
"It's dinnertime and we're French."

1085
01:19:25,898 --> 01:19:27,456
Don't give me that look.

1086
01:19:27,567 --> 01:19:29,728
You were distracting me in front of the press.

1087
01:19:29,836 --> 01:19:34,273
How am I supposed to concentrate with
you yanking on my hair all the time?

1088
01:19:34,373 --> 01:19:35,635
And that's another thing.

1089
01:19:35,741 --> 01:19:38,642
Your opinion isn't the only one that matters here.

1090
01:19:38,744 --> 01:19:41,338
Colette knows how to cook, too, you know.

1091
01:19:41,447 --> 01:19:42,937
All right, that's it!

1092
01:19:47,053 --> 01:19:48,782
You take a break, Little Chef.

1093
01:19:48,888 --> 01:19:50,116
I'm not your puppet,

1094
01:19:50,223 --> 01:19:53,317
and you're not
my puppet-controlling guy!

1095
01:19:53,426 --> 01:19:55,223
The rat is the cook.

1096
01:19:55,328 --> 01:19:55,961
You cool off and get your mind right, Little Chef.

1097
01:19:55,962 --> 01:19:58,226
You cool off and get your mind right, Little Chef.

1098
01:19:58,331 --> 01:20:01,300
Ego is coming, and I need to focus!

1099
01:20:04,403 --> 01:20:05,768
You stupid...

1100
01:20:08,307 --> 01:20:11,538
Wow. I have never seen that before.

1101
01:20:11,644 --> 01:20:14,943
Yeah, it's like you're his fluffy bunny or something.

1102
01:20:16,449 --> 01:20:17,939
I'm sorry, Remy.

1103
01:20:18,050 --> 01:20:19,084
I know there are too many guys.

1104
01:20:19,152 --> 01:20:20,119
- I tried to limit...
- You know what?

1105
01:20:20,219 --> 01:20:22,050
It's okay. I've been selfish.

1106
01:20:22,155 --> 01:20:24,180
- You guys hungry?
- Are you kidding?

1107
01:20:24,290 --> 01:20:27,259
All right. Dinner's on me.
We'll go after closing time.

1108
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:28,520
- In fact...
- Yeah.

1109
01:20:28,628 --> 01:20:30,994
...tell Dad to bring the whole clan.

1110
01:20:32,632 --> 01:20:34,156
Little Chef?

1111
01:20:43,643 --> 01:20:48,376
This is great, Son.
An inside job. I see the appeal.

1112
01:21:08,034 --> 01:21:09,092
Oof!

1113
01:21:25,318 --> 01:21:26,717
Little Chef?

1114
01:21:27,486 --> 01:21:28,748
Little Chef?

1115
01:21:29,488 --> 01:21:31,080
Hey, Little Chef.

1116
01:21:31,424 --> 01:21:34,484
I thought you went back to the apartment.

1117
01:21:34,694 --> 01:21:38,824
Then when you weren't there, I don't know...

1118
01:21:39,165 --> 01:21:43,192
It didn't seem right to leave things
the way that we did, so...

1119
01:21:44,237 --> 01:21:46,137
Look, I don't want to fight.

1120
01:21:46,339 --> 01:21:48,967
I've been under a lot of, you know, pressure.

1121
01:21:49,175 --> 01:21:52,508
A lot has changed in not very much time, you know?

1122
01:21:52,612 --> 01:21:53,874
I'm suddenly a Gusteau.

1123
01:21:53,980 --> 01:21:55,880
And I got to be a Gusteau or, you know,

1124
01:21:57,149 --> 01:21:58,707
people will be disappointed.

1125
01:21:59,118 --> 01:22:00,710
It's weird.

1126
01:22:00,820 --> 01:22:03,755
You know, I've never disappointed anyone before,

1127
01:22:03,856 --> 01:22:06,654
because nobody's ever expected anything of me.

1128
01:22:06,759 --> 01:22:09,523
And the only reason anyone expects anything from me now

1129
01:22:09,629 --> 01:22:11,790
is because of you.

1130
01:22:13,432 --> 01:22:15,127
I haven't been fair to you.

1131
01:22:15,234 --> 01:22:18,692
You've never failed me, and I should never forget that.

1132
01:22:18,904 --> 01:22:20,599
You've been a good friend.

1133
01:22:20,806 --> 01:22:23,832
The most honorable friend a guy could ever ask...

1134
01:22:25,778 --> 01:22:27,075
What is this?

1135
01:22:27,546 --> 01:22:29,241
What's going on?

1136
01:22:31,684 --> 01:22:32,673
What...

1137
01:22:32,785 --> 01:22:33,752
Hey...

1138
01:22:34,353 --> 01:22:35,650
You're...

1139
01:22:35,755 --> 01:22:38,815
You're stealing food? How could you?

1140
01:22:38,924 --> 01:22:42,052
I thought you were my friend!
I trusted you!

1141
01:22:42,261 --> 01:22:44,491
Get out! You and all your rat buddies!

1142
01:22:44,597 --> 01:22:45,996
And don't come back

1143
01:22:46,098 --> 01:22:49,556
or I'll treat you the way restaurants
are supposed to treat pests!

1144
01:22:57,677 --> 01:23:00,942
You're right, Dad. Who am I kidding?

1145
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:04,881
We are what we are, and we're rats.

1146
01:23:06,352 --> 01:23:10,152
Well, he'll leave soon, and now you know how to get in.

1147
01:23:10,623 --> 01:23:12,022
Steal all you want.

1148
01:23:12,124 --> 01:23:15,059
- You're not coming?
- I've lost my appetite.

1149
01:23:29,642 --> 01:23:32,110
Do you know what you would like this evening, sir?

1150
01:23:32,211 --> 01:23:37,012
Yes, I'd like your heart roasted on a spit.

1151
01:23:42,388 --> 01:23:43,946
Come in!

1152
01:23:44,156 --> 01:23:47,353
Today's the big day.
You should say something to them.

1153
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:51,328
- Like what?
- You are the boss. Inspire them.

1154
01:23:54,667 --> 01:23:56,157
Attention.

1155
01:23:56,268 --> 01:23:59,038
Attention, everyone.

1156
01:23:59,205 --> 01:24:01,435
Tonight is a big night.

1157
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:05,508
Appetite is coming, and he's going to have a big ego.

1158
01:24:05,711 --> 01:24:09,670
I mean, Ego. He's coming. The critic.

1159
01:24:10,383 --> 01:24:13,352
And he's going to order something.

1160
01:24:13,953 --> 01:24:15,978
Something from our menu.

1161
01:24:16,689 --> 01:24:20,785
And we'll have to cook it,
unless he orders something cold.

1162
01:24:20,893 --> 01:24:22,758
Just can't leave it alone, can you?

1163
01:24:22,862 --> 01:24:26,491
You really shouldn't be here
during restaurant hours. It's not safe.

1164
01:24:26,599 --> 01:24:27,827
I'm hungry!

1165
01:24:27,933 --> 01:24:30,561
And I don't need the inside food to be happy.

1166
01:24:30,669 --> 01:24:33,729
The key, my friend, is to not be picky.

1167
01:24:34,106 --> 01:24:36,165
- Observe.
- No, wait!

1168
01:24:37,810 --> 01:24:41,678
- Oh, no! No, no! What do we do?
- I'll go get Dad.

1169
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:50,519
You might think you are a chef
but you are still only a rat.

1170
01:24:50,923 --> 01:24:54,154
Sure he took away a star last time he reviewed this place.

1171
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:56,660
Sure it probably killed... Dad.

1172
01:24:56,962 --> 01:25:00,728
- This is very bad juju right here.
- But I'll tell you one thing...

1173
01:25:00,833 --> 01:25:03,563
- Ego is here.
- Ego? He is here?

1174
01:25:05,571 --> 01:25:09,735
Anton Ego is just another customer.
Let's cook!

1175
01:25:09,842 --> 01:25:11,707
Yeah! Let's...

1176
01:25:12,144 --> 01:25:13,338
Okay.

1177
01:25:14,814 --> 01:25:17,681
So I have in mind a simple arrangement.

1178
01:25:17,883 --> 01:25:21,944
You will create for me a new line
of Chef Skinner frozen foods.

1179
01:25:22,054 --> 01:25:25,820
And I, in return, will not kill you.

1180
01:25:29,595 --> 01:25:32,758
<i>Au revoir, rat!</i>

1181
01:25:39,972 --> 01:25:42,634
Do you know what you would like this evening, sir?

1182
01:25:42,741 --> 01:25:44,265
Yes, I think I do.

1183
01:25:44,777 --> 01:25:48,907
After reading a lot of overheated
puffery about your new cook,

1184
01:25:49,014 --> 01:25:51,073
you know what I'm craving?

1185
01:25:52,151 --> 01:25:55,416
A little perspective.

1186
01:25:55,621 --> 01:26:00,684
That's it. I'd like some fresh, clear,
well seasoned perspective.

1187
01:26:00,793 --> 01:26:03,591
Can you suggest a good wine to go with that?

1188
01:26:03,696 --> 01:26:08,599
- With what, sir?
- Perspective. Fresh out, I take it?

1189
01:26:08,701 --> 01:26:09,861
I am...

1190
01:26:11,003 --> 01:26:13,767
Very well.
Since you're all out of perspective

1191
01:26:13,873 --> 01:26:17,240
and no one else seems to have it in this bloody town,

1192
01:26:17,343 --> 01:26:18,867
I'll make you a deal.

1193
01:26:18,978 --> 01:26:23,074
You provide the food, I'll provide the perspective.

1194
01:26:23,182 --> 01:26:27,209
Which would go nicely with a bottle of Cheval Blanc 1947.

1195
01:26:27,319 --> 01:26:29,116
I'm afraid I...

1196
01:26:30,823 --> 01:26:33,189
Your dinner selection?

1197
01:26:33,893 --> 01:26:38,660
Tell your Chef Linguini that I want
whatever he dares to serve me.

1198
01:26:38,764 --> 01:26:42,222
Tell him to hit me with his best shot.

1199
01:26:45,971 --> 01:26:48,872
I will have whatever he is having.

1200
01:26:55,714 --> 01:26:59,206
- So, we have given up.
- Why do you say that?

1201
01:26:59,418 --> 01:27:02,444
We are in a cage inside the car trunk

1202
01:27:02,655 --> 01:27:05,556
awaiting a future in frozen food products.

1203
01:27:05,758 --> 01:27:09,524
No, I'm the one in a cage. I've given up.

1204
01:27:09,862 --> 01:27:12,228
You are free.

1205
01:27:12,431 --> 01:27:15,832
I am only as free as you imagine me to be.

1206
01:27:15,935 --> 01:27:17,163
As you are.

1207
01:27:17,269 --> 01:27:21,899
Oh, please. I'm sick of pretending.
I pretend to be a rat for my father.

1208
01:27:22,007 --> 01:27:24,407
I pretend to be a human through Linguini.

1209
01:27:24,510 --> 01:27:27,240
I pretend you exist so I have someone to talk to!

1210
01:27:27,346 --> 01:27:29,314
You only tell me stuff I already know!

1211
01:27:29,415 --> 01:27:32,407
I know who I am!
Why do I need you to tell me?

1212
01:27:32,518 --> 01:27:34,486
Why do I need to pretend?

1213
01:27:36,589 --> 01:27:38,216
But you don't, Remy.

1214
01:27:39,024 --> 01:27:40,651
You never did.

1215
01:27:49,635 --> 01:27:51,603
No. My other left!

1216
01:27:51,804 --> 01:27:53,601
Dad? Dad, I'm in here!

1217
01:27:53,806 --> 01:27:56,104
I'm inside the trunk! What the...

1218
01:27:56,408 --> 01:27:57,397
Dad!

1219
01:27:58,043 --> 01:28:00,568
- Hey, little brother!
- Emile!

1220
01:28:04,116 --> 01:28:06,175
I love you guys!

1221
01:28:08,253 --> 01:28:09,311
Where are you going?

1222
01:28:09,421 --> 01:28:11,946
Back to the restaurant.
They'll fail without me.

1223
01:28:12,057 --> 01:28:15,618
- Why do you care?
- Because I'm a cook!

1224
01:28:23,335 --> 01:28:25,132
It's your recipe.

1225
01:28:25,237 --> 01:28:27,296
How can you not know your own recipe?

1226
01:28:27,406 --> 01:28:30,341
I didn't write it down. It just came to me.

1227
01:28:30,442 --> 01:28:33,536
<i>Then make it come to you again, ja?
Because we can't serve this!</i>

1228
01:28:33,646 --> 01:28:34,613
Where's my order?

1229
01:28:34,713 --> 01:28:37,079
Can't we serve something else?
Something I didn't invent?

1230
01:28:37,182 --> 01:28:38,240
This is what they're ordering.

1231
01:28:38,350 --> 01:28:40,682
Make them order something else.
Tell them we're all out.

1232
01:28:40,786 --> 01:28:42,481
We cannot be all out. We just opened.

1233
01:28:42,588 --> 01:28:45,580
I have another idea.
What if we serve them what they order!

1234
01:28:45,691 --> 01:28:47,818
We will make it.
Just tell us what you did.

1235
01:28:47,926 --> 01:28:49,291
I don't know what I did.

1236
01:28:49,395 --> 01:28:51,124
We need to tell the customers something.

1237
01:28:51,230 --> 01:28:53,130
Then tell them... Tell them...

1238
01:28:57,169 --> 01:28:58,431
Huh?

1239
01:28:59,238 --> 01:29:01,570
- Don't do it.
- Remy. Remy.

1240
01:29:01,674 --> 01:29:03,699
Don't! Stop!
They'll see you. Stop.

1241
01:29:03,809 --> 01:29:07,813
We're not talking about me.
We're talking about what to do right...

1242
01:29:08,247 --> 01:29:09,214
Rats!

1243
01:29:10,983 --> 01:29:12,541
- Remy!
- Get my knife.

1244
01:29:13,018 --> 01:29:14,645
Don't touch him!

1245
01:29:16,955 --> 01:29:19,321
Thanks for coming back, Little Chef.

1246
01:29:20,626 --> 01:29:22,924
I know this sounds insane, but...

1247
01:29:23,028 --> 01:29:25,588
Well, the truth sounds insane sometimes.

1248
01:29:25,698 --> 01:29:27,495
But that doesn't mean it's not

1249
01:29:27,599 --> 01:29:29,794
the truth.

1250
01:29:30,502 --> 01:29:34,734
And the truth is, I have no talent at all.

1251
01:29:35,507 --> 01:29:39,409
But this rat, he's the one behind these recipes.

1252
01:29:39,511 --> 01:29:44,608
He's the cook. The real cook.
He's been hiding under my toque.

1253
01:29:44,950 --> 01:29:46,884
He's been controlling my actions.

1254
01:29:48,954 --> 01:29:52,515
He's the reason I can cook the food
that's exciting everyone.

1255
01:29:52,725 --> 01:29:55,819
The reason Ego is outside that door.

1256
01:29:56,061 --> 01:29:58,859
You've been giving me credit for his gift.

1257
01:29:59,131 --> 01:30:00,723
I know it's a hard thing to believe.

1258
01:30:00,833 --> 01:30:03,802
But, hey, you believed I could cook, right?

1259
01:30:05,537 --> 01:30:09,701
Look, this works.
It's crazy, but it works.

1260
01:30:10,175 --> 01:30:12,643
We can be the greatest restaurant in Paris,

1261
01:30:12,745 --> 01:30:18,183
and this rat, this brilliant Little Chef,
can lead us there.

1262
01:30:18,917 --> 01:30:21,317
What do you say? You with me?

1263
01:32:09,294 --> 01:32:10,261
Dad.

1264
01:32:14,366 --> 01:32:17,335
Dad, I don't know what to say.

1265
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:21,563
I was wrong about your friend and about you.

1266
01:32:21,974 --> 01:32:25,842
I don't want you to think I'm choosing this over family.

1267
01:32:26,044 --> 01:32:28,808
I can't choose between two halves of myself.

1268
01:32:28,914 --> 01:32:32,748
I'm not talking about cooking.
I'm talking about guts.

1269
01:32:33,452 --> 01:32:35,852
This really means that much to you?

1270
01:32:43,862 --> 01:32:46,831
We're not cooks, but we are family.

1271
01:32:47,032 --> 01:32:50,024
You tell us what to do, and we'll get it done.

1272
01:32:58,010 --> 01:33:01,639
- Stop that health inspector!
- Delta Team, go, go, go, go!

1273
01:33:01,847 --> 01:33:03,974
The rest of you stay and help Remy.

1274
01:33:27,006 --> 01:33:28,940
Team three will be handling fish.
Team four, roasted items.

1275
01:33:28,941 --> 01:33:30,568
Team three will be handling fish.
Team four, roasted items.

1276
01:33:30,776 --> 01:33:36,214
Team five, grill. Team six, sauces.
Get to your stations. Let's go, go, go!

1277
01:33:36,515 --> 01:33:39,006
Those handling food will walk on two legs.

1278
01:33:48,727 --> 01:33:50,695
We need someone to wait tables.

1279
01:34:05,978 --> 01:34:09,004
I'm sorry for any delay, but we're a little short tonight.

1280
01:34:09,114 --> 01:34:11,378
Please, take all of the time you need.

1281
01:34:14,553 --> 01:34:17,147
He came in late one more time and all of a sudden he...

1282
01:34:21,460 --> 01:34:23,792
Make sure that steak is nice and tenderized.

1283
01:34:23,895 --> 01:34:26,227
Work it. Yeah. Stick and move.
Stick and move.

1284
01:34:26,331 --> 01:34:29,858
Easy with that sole meunière.
Less salt. More butter.

1285
01:34:30,068 --> 01:34:31,968
Only use the mimolette cheese.

1286
01:34:32,104 --> 01:34:35,733
Whoa! Compose the salad
like you were painting a picture.

1287
01:34:35,941 --> 01:34:38,569
Not too much vinaigrette on that salade composée.

1288
01:34:38,677 --> 01:34:41,771
Don't let that beurre blanc separate.
Keep whisking.

1289
01:34:41,947 --> 01:34:46,111
Gently poach the scallops.
Taste check. Spoons down.

1290
01:34:46,318 --> 01:34:48,650
Good. Too much salt. Good.

1291
01:34:48,854 --> 01:34:51,755
Don't boil the consommé,
it'll toughen the pheasant. Emile!

1292
01:34:51,857 --> 01:34:52,949
Sorry.

1293
01:34:56,561 --> 01:34:58,722
Colette, wait! Colette.

1294
01:34:59,164 --> 01:35:03,191
- You came back. Colette...
- Don't say a word.

1295
01:35:03,301 --> 01:35:04,859
If I think about it, I might change my mind.

1296
01:35:04,970 --> 01:35:07,438
Just tell me what the rat wants to cook.

1297
01:35:10,542 --> 01:35:13,033
Ratatouille? It's a peasant dish.

1298
01:35:13,178 --> 01:35:16,147
Are you sure you want to serve this to Ego?

1299
01:35:34,633 --> 01:35:36,498
What? I am making ratatouille.

1300
01:35:37,669 --> 01:35:40,137
Well, how would you prepare it?

1301
01:36:12,170 --> 01:36:15,333
Ratatouille? They must be joking.

1302
01:37:01,419 --> 01:37:02,681
Mmm.

1303
01:37:06,224 --> 01:37:07,987
No, it can't be.

1304
01:37:08,593 --> 01:37:12,222
Who cooked the ratatouille?
I demand to know!

1305
01:37:19,237 --> 01:37:20,864
I can't remember the last time

1306
01:37:20,972 --> 01:37:24,271
I asked a waiter to give my compliments to the chef.

1307
01:37:25,243 --> 01:37:28,041
And now I find myself in the extraordinary position

1308
01:37:28,146 --> 01:37:30,239
of having my waiter be the chef.

1309
01:37:30,448 --> 01:37:33,383
Thanks, but I'm just your waiter tonight.

1310
01:37:34,452 --> 01:37:36,920
Then who do I thank for the meal?

1311
01:37:37,789 --> 01:37:39,484
Excuse me a minute.

1312
01:37:50,502 --> 01:37:51,491
You must be the chef...

1313
01:37:51,603 --> 01:37:53,730
If you wish to meet the chef, you will have to wait

1314
01:37:53,838 --> 01:37:55,897
until all the other customer have gone.

1315
01:37:57,943 --> 01:37:59,103
So be it.

1316
01:38:20,799 --> 01:38:23,324
<i>At first, Ego thinks it's a joke.</i>

1317
01:38:23,535 --> 01:38:29,474
<i>But as Linguini explains, Ego's smile disappears.</i>

1318
01:38:35,080 --> 01:38:39,141
<i>He doesn't react beyond asking an occasional question.</i>

1319
01:38:39,684 --> 01:38:44,053
<i>And when the story is done,
Ego stands, thanks us for the meal...</i>

1320
01:38:44,155 --> 01:38:45,816
Thank you for the meal.

1321
01:38:45,924 --> 01:38:48,791
<i>...and leaves without another word.</i>

1322
01:38:51,062 --> 01:38:54,998
<i>The following day his review appears.</i>

1323
01:38:57,535 --> 01:39:01,631
<i>In many ways, the work of a critic is easy.</i>

1324
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:06,072
<i>We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those</i>

1325
01:39:06,177 --> 01:39:10,238
<i>who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment.</i>

1326
01:39:10,482 --> 01:39:15,852
<i>We thrive on negative criticism,
which is fun to write and to read.</i>

1327
01:39:16,388 --> 01:39:22,918
<i>But the bitter truth we critics must face
is that in the grand scheme of things,</i>

1328
01:39:23,028 --> 01:39:27,021
<i>the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful</i>

1329
01:39:27,132 --> 01:39:30,397
<i>than our criticism designating it so.</i>

1330
01:39:30,769 --> 01:39:34,899
<i>But there are times when a critic truly risks something</i>

1331
01:39:35,006 --> 01:39:39,306
<i>and that is in the discovery and defense of the new.</i>

1332
01:39:39,411 --> 01:39:44,007
<i>The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations.</i>

1333
01:39:44,215 --> 01:39:46,683
<i>The new needs friends.</i>

1334
01:39:46,985 --> 01:39:50,512
<i>Last night, I experienced something new,</i>

1335
01:39:50,722 --> 01:39:55,682
<i>an extraordinary meal from a singularly unexpected source.</i>

1336
01:39:55,894 --> 01:39:58,522
<i>To say that both the meal and its maker</i>

1337
01:39:58,630 --> 01:40:02,122
<i>have challenged my preconceptions about fine cooking</i>

1338
01:40:02,233 --> 01:40:04,929
<i>is a gross understatement.</i>

1339
01:40:05,337 --> 01:40:08,534
<i>They have rocked me to my core.</i>

1340
01:40:09,274 --> 01:40:12,732
<i>In the past, I have made no secret of my disdain</i>

1341
01:40:12,844 --> 01:40:17,804
<i>for Chef Gusteau's famous motto,
"Anyone can cook. "</i>

1342
01:40:18,116 --> 01:40:24,316
<i>But I realize only now
do I truly understand what he meant.</i>

1343
01:40:24,622 --> 01:40:28,558
<i>Not everyone can become a great artist,</i>

1344
01:40:28,660 --> 01:40:32,994
<i>but a great artist can come from anywhere.</i>

1345
01:40:33,598 --> 01:40:36,863
<i>It is difficult to imagine more humble origins</i>

1346
01:40:36,968 --> 01:40:40,836
<i>than those of the genius now cooking at Gusteau's,</i>

1347
01:40:40,939 --> 01:40:43,772
<i>who is, in this critic's opinion,</i>

1348
01:40:43,875 --> 01:40:48,107
<i>nothing less than the finest chef in France.</i>

1349
01:40:48,313 --> 01:40:50,180
<i>I will be returning to Gusteau's soon, hungry for more.</i>

1350
01:40:50,181 --> 01:40:53,639
<i>I will be returning to Gusteau's soon, hungry for more.</i>

1351
01:40:54,018 --> 01:40:55,542
<i>It was a great night.</i>

1352
01:40:55,653 --> 01:40:57,382
<i>The happiest of my life.</i>

1353
01:40:57,489 --> 01:41:02,017
<i>But the only thing predictable
about life is its unpredictability.</i>

1354
01:41:02,127 --> 01:41:05,290
<i>Well, we had to let Skinner
and the health inspector loose,</i>

1355
01:41:05,397 --> 01:41:07,797
<i>and of course they ratted us out.</i>

1356
01:41:08,166 --> 01:41:09,793
<i>The food didn't matter.</i>

1357
01:41:09,901 --> 01:41:12,267
<i>Once it got out there were rats in the kitchen,</i>

1358
01:41:12,370 --> 01:41:14,429
<i>oh, man, the restaurant was closed</i>

1359
01:41:14,539 --> 01:41:17,269
and Ego lost his job and his credibility.

1360
01:41:17,375 --> 01:41:19,309
But don't feel too bad for him.

1361
01:41:19,411 --> 01:41:22,903
He's doing very well as a small business investor.

1362
01:41:23,248 --> 01:41:25,808
- He seems very happy.
- How do you know?

1363
