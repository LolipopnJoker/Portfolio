00:55:28,326 --> 00:55:32,914
General, maybe you should slow down,
we have a big day tomorrow.

2
00:55:33,873 --> 00:55:39,587
We're celebrating, captain. It's not every day you win
a war, let alone against the American devils.

3
00:55:41,798 --> 00:55:43,424
I'm getting another bottle.

4
00:56:00,483 --> 00:56:01,526
Excuse me.

5
00:56:01,776 --> 00:56:04,654
I'm pretty sure it was my fault.

6
00:56:05,071 --> 00:56:06,489
You speak Vietnamese.

7
00:56:06,698 --> 00:56:07,824
I'm an interpreter.

8
00:56:09,826 --> 00:56:12,328
I speak many tongues.

9
00:56:13,037 --> 00:56:15,248
Let me buy you another drink...

10
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:17,667
unless you're here with someone.

11
00:56:18,334 --> 00:56:20,670
I'm alone.

12
00:56:21,963 --> 00:56:24,257
A bottle of Johnnie Walker please.

13
00:56:39,022 --> 00:56:41,691
You're going to the Summit tomorrow?

14
00:56:46,738 --> 00:56:51,743
A pretty girl interested in politics...

15
00:56:51,868 --> 00:56:54,454
Looks can be deceiving.

16
01:13:03,797 --> 01:13:05,215
Terrible thing.

17
01:13:06,383 --> 01:13:07,801
<i>Wha t is?</i>

18
01:13:08,343 --> 01:13:09,678
Being born like that.

19
01:13:09,803 --> 01:13:10,929
Is it?

20
01:13:11,263 --> 01:13:13,515
Can you imagine...

21
01:13:13,807 --> 01:13:16,476
Looking in the mirror and seeing that
staring back at you?

22
01:13:17,561 --> 01:13:20,314
Yes, I can.

23
01:13:22,524 --> 01:13:25,152
Where do you think she comes from?

24
01:13:25,444 --> 01:13:28,238
You think she has a family?
