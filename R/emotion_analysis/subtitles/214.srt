something yellow...

Name one other thing
in this whole arcade

15
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:20,544

that Zangief waxes?

25
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:42,400

were confined to his chest,

26
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:43,567
I might agree...

27
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:45,102

It is new, it is different,

01:06:53,588 --> 01:06:55,333
<i>It's gonna be unlocked
next month.</i>

1709
01:06:55,335 --> 01:06:57,430
Hey, what are you doing
in that awful game with her?

1710
01:06:57,432 --> 01:06:58,965
<i>I think
the track will end...</i>

1711
01:06:58,967 --> 01:07:01,568
right over there. Yo,
it's gonna be so tight.

1712
01:07:01,570 --> 01:07:03,603
- VANELLOPE: Oh, I love it.
- (INAUDIBLE)

1713
01:07:03,605 --> 01:07:04,904
Hey, can I tell you something

1714
01:07:04,906 --> 01:07:07,141
that I don't think
I could ever tell Ralph?

1715
01:07:07,143 --> 01:07:08,575
SHANK: Of course.

1716
01:07:08,577 --> 01:07:10,110
VANELLOPE:
I know it sounds crazy...

1717
01:07:10,112 --> 01:07:13,615
but the second I walked
into this game, it felt...

1718
01:07:14,482 --> 01:07:16,463
Well, it felt like home.

1719
01:07:16,465 --> 01:07:19,053
I mean, more than
<i>Sugar Rush</i> ever did.

1720
01:07:19,055 --> 01:07:20,955
Oh, yeah? How so?

1721
01:07:20,957 --> 01:07:22,789
'Cause it's like my dream.

1722
01:07:22,791 --> 01:07:24,992
It's full of weirdos...

1723
01:07:24,994 --> 01:07:28,202
and the racing
is super dangerous...

1724
01:07:28,204 --> 01:07:30,699
and you never know
what's gonna happen next.

1725
01:07:31,316 --> 01:07:32,617
I mean, back home,

1726
01:07:32,619 --> 01:07:35,085
I know exactly
what's gonna happen next...

1727
01:07:35,087 --> 01:07:38,090
because Ralph's dream is to
do the same thing every day.

1728
01:07:40,259 --> 01:07:41,393
Hmm.

1729
01:07:43,630 --> 01:07:47,130
Here's something
I wish I'd learned years ago.

1730
01:07:47,132 --> 01:07:48,524
There is no law

1731
01:07:48,526 --> 01:07:51,960
saying best friends
have to have the same dreams.

1732
01:07:51,962 --> 01:07:52,963
You know?

1733
01:07:53,398 --> 01:07:54,530
Whoa.

1734
01:07:54,532 --> 01:07:56,199
Yeah.

1735
01:07:56,201 --> 01:07:59,569
You are a very
wise person, Shank.

1736
01:07:59,571 --> 01:08:01,970
And a good friend, too.

1737
01:08:01,972 --> 01:08:03,339
Thank you.

1738
01:08:03,341 --> 01:08:05,886
Around here, peeps like
to say, "Shank you."

1739
01:08:05,888 --> 01:08:07,210
(CHUCKLES)

1740
01:08:07,212 --> 01:08:09,320
You know,
after you go home

1741
01:08:09,322 --> 01:08:11,221
and your life
gets back to normal...

1742
01:08:11,223 --> 01:08:13,190
you are always
welcome here.

1743
01:08:13,192 --> 01:08:16,193
But that's the thing,
I want this to be my normal.

1744
01:08:16,195 --> 01:08:18,264
I want this to be my life.

1745
01:08:19,323 --> 01:08:20,693
I can't go home now.

1746
01:08:22,783 --> 01:08:24,017
I just can't.

1747
01:08:27,014 --> 01:08:28,348
(BEEPS)

1748
01:08:32,352 --> 01:08:33,353
Wow.

1749
01:08:34,093 --> 01:08:35,488
You know,
where I come from,

1750
01:08:35,490 --> 01:08:37,790
that's called
a kick in the face.

1751
01:08:37,792 --> 01:08:39,625
I can't believe it.

1752
01:08:39,627 --> 01:08:42,395
A straight-up donkey kick
to the teeth.

1753
01:08:42,397 --> 01:08:44,399
She's supposed to be
my best friend.

1754
01:08:45,065 --> 01:08:46,468
No, this can't be right.

1755
01:08:47,769 --> 01:08:49,602
No, she's been brainwashed.

1756
01:08:49,604 --> 01:08:51,103
That's what this is.

1757
01:08:51,105 --> 01:08:52,138
Because the Vanellope I know

1758
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:53,573
would never abandon me
like that.

1759
01:08:53,575 --> 01:08:55,341
I gotta get her out
of there now.

1760
01:08:55,343 --> 01:08:57,290
Hey, easy now, tiger.

1761
01:08:57,292 --> 01:08:58,744
I admire the impulse...

1762
01:08:58,746 --> 01:09:01,280
but you charge in there
like some white knight...

1763
01:09:01,282 --> 01:09:02,682
she's liable to hold it
against you.

1764
01:09:02,684 --> 01:09:05,118
So what? I'm supposed to
just let her stay in a game

1765
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:06,252
that's obviously bad for her?

1766
01:09:06,254 --> 01:09:07,453
Of course not.

1767
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:09,389
Then how do I make her leave?

1768
01:09:09,391 --> 01:09:12,492
She thinks it's so cool
and exciting in there.

1769
01:09:12,494 --> 01:09:16,362
Unless you know how I can
make the game boring or...

1770
01:09:16,364 --> 01:09:20,166
Wait. You know about viruses
and stuff, right, Spamley?

1771
01:09:20,168 --> 01:09:22,135
- Who's asking?
- Whoa.

1772
01:09:22,137 --> 01:09:23,469
Back home, me and the kid

1773
01:09:23,471 --> 01:09:25,947
used to goof off
in this game called <i>Tron.</i>

1774
01:09:25,949 --> 01:09:28,516
But then it got a virus that
made the motorbikes go slow...

1775
01:09:28,518 --> 01:09:30,518
and then Vanellope stopped
wanting to hang out in there.

1776
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:32,186
So, is there a way

1777
01:09:32,188 --> 01:09:34,355
to do something
like that to <i>Slaughter Race?</i>

1778
01:09:34,357 --> 01:09:35,392
Oh, there's ways.

1779
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:37,827
Follow me.

1780
01:09:42,599 --> 01:09:44,198
I got mothers' maiden names...

1781
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:46,534
social security numbers,
PIN numbers...

1782
01:09:46,536 --> 01:09:47,969
SPAMLEY:
Now, this area down here

1783
01:09:47,971 --> 01:09:49,287
is what's called the Darknet.

1784
01:09:49,289 --> 01:09:51,156
A lot of shady characters
hang out down here...

1785
01:09:51,158 --> 01:09:53,324
so try to keep a low profile.
Gord!

1786
01:09:53,326 --> 01:09:55,126
- (YELPS)
- Oh, there you are.

1787
01:09:55,128 --> 01:09:57,512
Now Gord here, he's
dabbled in virus-making.

1788
01:09:57,514 --> 01:09:59,514
But his cousin, this guy
we're gonna go see...

1789
01:09:59,516 --> 01:10:02,486
Double Dan, this dude
is a virus-making machine.

1790
01:10:03,504 --> 01:10:04,536
Oh, oh, here we go.

1791
01:10:04,538 --> 01:10:06,571
Are you sure this is safe?

1792
01:10:06,573 --> 01:10:08,406
(CHUCKLES) Is it safe?
Of course it is.

1793
01:10:08,408 --> 01:10:11,376
Just whatever you do, do not
look at his little brother.

1794
01:10:11,378 --> 01:10:12,880
Oh, he has a little brother?

1795
01:10:16,650 --> 01:10:18,483
Double Dan!
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

1796
01:10:18,485 --> 01:10:19,885
Long time no see.

1797
01:10:19,887 --> 01:10:21,386
Who are you?

1798
01:10:21,388 --> 01:10:22,788
(STAMMERS) JP Spamley.

1799
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:24,790
Uh, we met one time
over at Friendster...

1800
01:10:24,792 --> 01:10:28,426
which tells you
it had to be a long time ago.

1801
01:10:28,428 --> 01:10:29,896
- Oye. What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

1802
01:10:29,898 --> 01:10:30,997
Are you looking at my brother?

1803
01:10:30,999 --> 01:10:32,064
- No, sir.
- Don't you look

1804
01:10:32,066 --> 01:10:33,032
at my little brother.

1805
01:10:33,034 --> 01:10:35,367
- Oh, no, I wasn't.
- He's very self-conscious!

1806
01:10:35,369 --> 01:10:36,535

1808
01:10:38,405 --> 01:10:39,671
You?

1809
01:10:39,673 --> 01:10:41,540
What are you doing here?

1810
01:10:41,542 --> 01:10:42,774
Uh... (CLEARS THROAT)

1811
01:10:42,776 --> 01:10:44,811
The reason I came to
your neck of the face...

1812
01:10:44,813 --> 01:10:47,613
I mean, there's a face
in your neck. I mean, woods.

1813
01:10:47,615 --> 01:10:49,949
Neck of the woods. The reason
I'm here is 'cause I...

1814
01:10:49,951 --> 01:10:52,167
Well, I heard
a little tumor, rumor...

1815
01:10:52,169 --> 01:10:53,603
I heard a rumor
that you could, well,

1816
01:10:53,605 --> 01:10:56,154
give me a harmless virus
kind of thing...

1817
01:10:56,156 --> 01:10:57,122
that might be able to

1818
01:10:57,124 --> 01:10:59,124
slow down
the <i>Slaughter Ra</i> game?

1819
01:10:59,126 --> 01:11:00,860
Oh, yeah.

1820
01:11:00,862 --> 01:11:03,696
My cousin Gordon told me
that you wanted to crash it.

1821
01:11:03,698 --> 01:11:04,797
Crash it? No!

1822
01:11:04,799 --> 01:11:06,666
No, no, no.

1823
01:11:06,668 --> 01:11:08,267
(STAMMERS) I don't want
anyone getting hurt.

1824
01:11:08,269 --> 01:11:09,401
DOUBLE DAN: Hmm.

1825
01:11:09,403 --> 01:11:11,471
If there's a way
to just, uh...

1826
01:11:11,473 --> 01:11:12,438
I don't know...

1827
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:14,774
just make the cars
go slow or something...

1828
01:11:14,776 --> 01:11:17,376
so the game is boring...

1829
01:11:17,378 --> 01:11:19,512
and my friend
comes back home to me.

1830
01:11:19,514 --> 01:11:23,416
Allow me to
introduce you to Arthur.

1831
01:11:23,418 --> 01:11:24,784
- (GROWLING)
- (BOTH YELPING)

1832
01:11:24,786 --> 01:11:26,819
Easy there, boy. (LAUGHS)

1833
01:11:26,821 --> 01:11:28,424
He's keen.

1834
01:11:28,426 --> 01:11:32,192
Arthur's what I call
an insecurity virus.

1835
01:11:32,194 --> 01:11:35,136
Means he looks for
little flaws and weaknesses

1836
01:11:35,138 --> 01:11:37,252
that make a program insecure.

1837
01:11:39,468 --> 01:11:42,235
You release him into that
<i>Slaughter Race</i> game,

1838
01:11:42,237 --> 01:11:44,970
Arthur will find some defect
in the code.

1839
01:11:44,972 --> 01:11:46,539
Then he'll copy that defect

1840
01:11:46,541 --> 01:11:49,276
and spread it
all over the game...

1841
01:11:49,278 --> 01:11:52,911
until everything becomes,
quote, unquote, "boring"...

1842
01:11:52,913 --> 01:11:55,348
just like you wanted.

1843
01:11:55,350 --> 01:11:56,516
Okay.

1844
01:11:56,518 --> 01:11:58,418
Just to be super clear here...

1845
01:11:58,420 --> 01:11:59,885
no one gets hurt, right?

1846
01:11:59,887 --> 01:12:01,021
Are you stupid?

1847
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:02,088
Well, uh...

1848
01:12:02,090 --> 01:12:04,291
Because the only way
anyone gets hurt...

1849
01:12:04,293 --> 01:12:05,791
is if you are stupid.

1850
01:12:05,793 --> 01:12:07,294
All you have to do...

1851
01:12:07,296 --> 01:12:10,580
is make sure the virus stays
in <i>Slaughter Race.</i>

1852
01:12:10,582 --> 01:12:12,582
Right. Don't be stupid.

1853
01:12:12,584 --> 01:12:13,917
Make sure it doesn't get out
of <i>Slaughter Race.</i>

1854
01:12:13,919 --> 01:12:15,018
Goiter it. Gah!

1855
