1
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:15,115
Heat once the weather.

2
00:01:16,124 --> 00:01:20,026
Land here tastes like dog shit.

3
00:01:20,061 --> 00:01:21,926
You know, huh?

4
00:01:22,063 --> 00:01:23,860
Fuck!

5
00:01:30,104 --> 00:01:31,969
Break.

6
00:02:10,111 --> 00:02:15,048
There are men of military force, are call,
pay attention to the convoy. over.
7
00:03:13,482 --> 00:03:18,419
lf he reported troop movements please shoot.
Your turn. over
8
00:03:18,421 --> 00:03:21,288
Maybe he called his wife.

7
00:02:30,097 --> 00:02:32,088
Him down.

8
00:02:41,008 --> 00:02:45,945
Moment. There were women and children,
within 200 yards, moving towards the convoy.

9
00:02:50,151 --> 00:02:53,018
Arms were not moving.
He brought something.

10
00:03:02,997 --> 00:03:06,990
He pulls out a grenade. RKG Russia grenade.
l think he gave it to the boy.

11
00:03:08,002 --> 00:03:11,904
- Women and children? - You saw it?
Can insure?

12
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:14,100
Negative. You know ROE.
Your turn.

13
00:03:14,141 --> 00:03:17,941
- They will burn you if you're wrong.
They will put you in jail. - Fuck.

14
00:03:35,062 --> 00:03:36,029
You've done about it.

15
00:03:53,881 --> 00:03:54,142
Come back here.

16
00:03:57,118 --> 00:03:59,109
Never leave your
gun on the ground.

17
00:04:00,121 --> 00:04:01,110
Yes, sir.

18
00:04:05,927 --> 00:04:09,124
Good shot. You're talented.

19
00:04:10,998 --> 00:04:13,057
One day you will
be a great hunter.

20
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:20,006
Listen to this book, several times.
That judgment ..

21
00:04:20,942 --> 00:04:22,102
for the trust.

22
00:04:23,878 --> 00:04:27,041
Time where we have to do it.
We can not see with his eyes.

23
00:04:28,015 --> 00:04:30,882
So we do not know the
glory of his plans.

24
00:04:31,152 --> 00:04:35,885
Eyes we see it as a
reflection in the glass.

25
00:04:37,024 --> 00:04:38,889
- The day we arrived...
- Why are you doing this?

26
00:04:40,861 --> 00:04:44,991
We will see it clearly. And
understand the mystery of how.

27
00:04:45,933 --> 00:04:47,059
Let us pray.

28
00:04:48,035 --> 00:04:50,128
There are 3 types of
people in this world.

29
00:04:51,138 --> 00:04:54,107
Sheep, wolf and sheepdog.

30
00:04:55,109 --> 00:04:57,134
Some people believe

31
00:04:58,045 --> 00:05:00,104
devil does not exist
in the world--

32
00:05:00,915 --> 00:05:04,078
And if hatred appeared at their door
do not know how to protect themselves.

33
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:06,045
lt was a sheep.

34
00:05:07,154 --> 00:05:10,954
Then there are predators.
They use violence

35
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:11,982
to prey on the weak.

36
00:05:12,026 --> 00:05:13,891
They are wolves.

37
00:05:14,996 --> 00:05:16,861
Then there are those

38
00:05:17,031 --> 00:05:19,056
blessed with talent aggression

39
00:05:19,867 --> 00:05:22,028
and protect the flock.

40
00:05:23,971 --> 00:05:27,099
They are a rare breed who
live to face serigala--

41
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,010
They sheepdog.

42
00:05:33,147 --> 00:05:36,116
We do not raise sheep
in this family

43
00:05:38,052 --> 00:05:40,987
and l would beat if you become wolves.
- Wayne--

44
00:05:45,926 --> 00:05:47,860
But we protect our herd.

45
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,998
And if someone tried to fight

46
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:55,935
or protect your sister you get
my permission to finish .

47
00:05:55,936 --> 00:05:57,995
He attacked Jeff.

48
00:05:59,073 --> 00:06:03,032
ls that correct?
- Yes, Sir. True.

49
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:05,971
And you finish it?

50
00:06:09,984 --> 00:06:11,884
You know who you are.

51
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,116
You know your goals.

52
00:07:10,945 --> 00:07:12,970
There is not anyone there.

53
00:07:13,147 --> 00:07:15,115
You're out with a waist belt.

54
00:07:15,883 --> 00:07:18,875
- What should you do?
- Sleeping with it.

55
00:07:18,886 --> 00:07:22,151
- l'll wear it and see her make mood changed.
- Strong winds make her mood changed.

56
00:07:22,156 --> 00:07:23,919
ls that what they say?

57
00:07:24,058 --> 00:07:28,017
- You know what they call it when
Sarah menghisap-- SMA-- - Do not say.

58
00:07:28,028 --> 00:07:29,086
Jeez, Chris.

59
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,995
lt recompense.

60
00:07:38,873 --> 00:07:44,106
- There are 2 ladies...
- She continues to see it.

61
00:07:44,912 --> 00:07:48,109
- Wait till you see this.
- Yes l Do.

62
00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:51,042
Hey, babe who wants rodeo star?

63
00:07:51,051 --> 00:07:52,040
What the fuck?

64
00:07:52,086 --> 00:07:54,054
You said he did not come
home until tomorrow.

65
00:07:54,054 --> 00:07:57,023
- l said what?
- Do not bother him.

66
00:07:57,057 --> 00:07:59,025
He did not do anything.

67
00:07:59,026 --> 00:08:00,960
Chris, do not disturb him!

68
00:08:00,961 --> 00:08:03,054
Leave him alone!

69
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,894
Fuck, what's with you ?!

70
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,061
- He does not know, okay?
- What does she know?

71
00:08:08,102 --> 00:08:09,865
- You do not know?
- l take my hat.

72
00:08:10,004 --> 00:08:13,064
He does not know.

73
00:08:13,073 --> 00:08:18,010
- You do not know?
- What is wrong with you ?!

74
00:08:18,045 --> 00:08:21,014
Why did you do that to everyone?

75
00:08:21,015 --> 00:08:22,983
Get out of here!

76
00:08:24,151 --> 00:08:26,915
What is it with you!

77
00:08:29,156 --> 00:08:31,989
- Exit.
- l do not know what you expect of me.

78
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:35,893
You brought me here and exit together
with your brother every weekend!

79
00:08:36,864 --> 00:08:38,855
Think why am l doing this?

80
00:08:38,966 --> 00:08:41,901
l'm doing this to get attention!

81
00:08:44,905 --> 00:08:47,032
Take your things and get out.

82
00:08:48,108 --> 00:08:50,872
Good. Screw you!

83
00:08:52,012 --> 00:08:54,071
Do you think you could
be a rodeo cowboy for?

84
00:08:54,915 --> 00:08:57,907
You're not a cowboy. You
only farm administrators.

85
00:08:58,018 --> 00:09:00,009
And you lowly!

86
00:09:06,126 --> 00:09:07,923
Do not say.

87
00:09:08,896 --> 00:09:09,920
Gosh.

88
00:09:13,934 --> 00:09:19,065
l do not understand what you said.
We had to travel to another state.

89
00:09:19,907 --> 00:09:22,068
Different city every weekend.

90
00:09:23,143 --> 00:09:27,102
- Can not stay here.
- Maybe he's right.

91
00:09:27,147 --> 00:09:30,981
- But he's right.
- True matter what, Chris?

92
00:09:31,118 --> 00:09:35,054
He was not true. We cowboy.
Living in a dream.

00:09:50,137 --> 00:09:55,040
Friend, friend see this.

Meet elite fighters.

- Seals?
- Sea, air and land.

100
00:10:33,013 --> 00:10:37,006

Thank this!

104
00:10:49,163 --> 00:10:52,929
This is the first time.

105

lf you are swept away,
you're going to die!

106
00:10:57,071 --> 00:11:00,131
Do not turn your face from me.
View and accept this.

107
00:11:00,908 --> 00:11:03,069
Old are old, huh?

108
00:11:03,911 --> 00:11:07,039
Did you join the Navy because they
want to have fun at Noah's Ark?

109
00:11:07,047 --> 00:11:11,108
- How old are you? 30! You've dusty
and disappeared. - 30 years.

110
00:11:11,985 --> 00:11:13,919
We will do it again.

111
00:11:14,021 --> 00:11:18,958
We're going to be a fighter.

112
00:11:18,992 --> 00:11:21,859
l never see him.

113
00:11:21,929 --> 00:11:25,922
l come to deal with terrorists.

114
00:11:25,999 --> 00:11:28,968
Who did it?

115
00:11:29,002 --> 00:11:31,129
l do not know.

116
00:11:31,138 --> 00:11:34,130
- Did l ask you?
- Do Not.

117
00:11:34,942 --> 00:11:37,877
Look at you.

118
00:11:37,911 --> 00:11:44,077
You bastard! That's what l said.

119
00:11:44,918 --> 00:11:47,853
Biggles, the name now.

120
00:11:47,955 --> 00:11:49,923
And the tickets very difficult.

121
00:11:49,923 --> 00:11:54,087
What are you doing here
if you hate water ?

122
00:11:54,128 --> 00:11:56,062
Never mind, sir. l'm not black.

123
00:11:56,096 --> 00:12:01,898
- No? - l'm the new black. We
ran slow, low jump and swim.

00:12:01,935 --> 00:12:05,894
And l make whites proud!

That people who quit!

126
00:12:13,147 --> 00:12:15,081
You say goodbye.

127
00:12:15,949 --> 00:12:18,884
lf he stops here, he stopped
on the battlefield.

128
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:22,921
When everything is in trouble,
he will not pull you out.

129
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:26,958
l am looking for a knight.

130
00:12:28,028 --> 00:12:33,967
l can not hear? Do you want to call your
parents? Maybe they can replace you.

131
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:39,027
This is a game.

132
00:12:39,072 --> 00:12:44,874
That's what l'm talking about.
- Where are you?

133
00:12:44,878 --> 00:12:47,904
We will survive, sir!

00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,009
Give her speech.

How are you, old man?

137
00:12:56,957 --> 00:12:57,946
How are you?

138
00:12:58,058 --> 00:12:59,889

00:13:00,027 --> 00:13:04,896

Not the way to start a
conversation, dear.

351
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:52,130
Do not behave like that to me.

352
00:34:53,005 --> 00:34:55,030
l want you to tell
me everything.

353
00:34:55,908 --> 00:34:58,968
There are some things that can
not be said on the phone .

00:34:59,078 --> 00:35:04,015
You make me pregnant and l
sat alone put up cots ...

... and you can not talk to me?

356
00:35:06,085 --> 00:35:08,053
That's your big plan?

357
00:35:10,022 --> 00:35:12,081
All okay in there?

358
00:35:12,992 --> 00:35:16,894

Yes.

361
00:35:23,068 --> 00:35:28,096
Three days is not
counted as a honeymoon.

362
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,904
lt was three days of fun.

363
00:35:35,147 --> 00:35:39,914

364
00:35:39,985 --> 00:35:45,116
- You want me to talk naughty to you?
- Yes, wait a minute.

365
00:35:50,896 --> 00:35:53,888
l was holding a rifle.

366
00:35:53,899 --> 00:35:57,027
You have to decide which
is more important, dear.

367
00:35:58,037 --> 00:36:00,870
You really are lust.

368
00:36:00,906 --> 00:36:03,875
l'm fat and horny.
lt was disgusting.

369
00:36:04,076 --> 00:36:07,045
Although weight is 150 pounds, l
still want to make love to you.

370
00:36:07,913 --> 00:36:11,110
- Really romantic.
- How is my son?

371
00:36:12,051 --> 00:36:17,045
- No one said he was a man.
- You two would be amazing.

372
00:36:17,923 --> 00:36:19,117
How do you know?

373
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,987
l know. l can see it.

374
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:28,158
- l hope you're right.
- l am right.

375
00:36:31,136 --> 00:36:35,072
- Your father contacted you?
- l do not check my email.

376
00:36:35,107 --> 00:36:37,007
Gosh.

377
00:36:37,009 --> 00:36:39,102
You should call him, okay?

378
00:36:39,144 --> 00:36:42,113
- What is it?
- l do not think straight.

379
00:36:42,147 --> 00:36:45,048
What is it?

380
00:36:47,086 --> 00:36:50,988
- Brother sent.
- What do you mean? To a school?

381
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:54,084
No, he did not go to school.
Contact your father.

382
00:36:54,126 --> 00:36:57,027
What do you mean? Where is she?

383
00:36:57,897 --> 00:36:59,057
There.

384
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,128
She toward lraq.

385
00:37:03,002 --> 00:37:05,095
Sorry, dear.

386
00:37:09,141 --> 00:37:14,078
The man who held the knife is a member of
the radical Jordan Bin Laden financed.

387
00:37:14,113 --> 00:37:17,913
Trained by Bin Laden,
loyal to bin Laden.

388
00:37:17,917 --> 00:37:21,011
Name was Zarqawi.

389
00:37:21,153 --> 00:37:26,113
Bastard This is the prince
of Al-Qaeda in lraq.

390
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:30,993
Army, AQl, amounted
to 5 thousand people.

391
00:37:30,996 --> 00:37:33,055
They are not ordinary
mercenary troops.

392
00:37:33,098 --> 00:37:35,896
They are well
trained, well paid...

393
00:37:35,901 --> 00:37:40,099
... and this time, they run the operation
biggest offensive since Vietnam.

394
00:37:41,006 --> 00:37:45,136
Zarqawi and his Lieutenant,
they is our top priority.

395
00:37:45,144 --> 00:37:48,113
There is only one
way to find their .

396
00:37:48,113 --> 00:37:52,846
That check from door to
door, until we find them...

397
00:37:52,885 --> 00:37:55,945
... Or someone who could
provide their location.

398
00:37:56,121 --> 00:38:00,854
So we need to examine
10 building per hour.

399
00:38:00,893 --> 00:38:03,157
l know it very much,
very aggressive .

400
00:38:03,162 --> 00:38:06,893
Do not rely on air support.

401
00:38:06,899 --> 00:38:10,892
This is the highest priority
targets until today.

402
00:38:10,936 --> 00:38:15,066
l want them dead or
captured, understand?

403
00:38:16,008 --> 00:38:17,873
Have a question?

404
00:38:21,981 --> 00:38:25,940
lf the marines haste,
they could be shot.

405
00:38:25,985 --> 00:38:28,044
They can not be
training like us.

406
00:38:28,053 --> 00:38:30,021
Most of them civilians
6 months ago.

407
00:38:30,022 --> 00:38:33,924
Let us train them. l
will show them how.

408
00:38:33,959 --> 00:38:35,950
No, we need you to keep
an eye on the situation.

409
00:38:35,961 --> 00:38:39,988
- The enemy already knows we're up there.
- Under extremely dangerous.

410
00:38:40,899 --> 00:38:42,867
You want to be the savior?

411
00:38:42,868 --> 00:38:45,860
l just wanted to catch them.
Can not see, can not shoot.

412
00:38:45,904 --> 00:38:49,032
They all know your name. They
feel safe when you're up there.

413
00:38:49,074 --> 00:38:51,872
- No.
- That's what they think.

414
00:38:52,044 --> 00:38:55,946
So stay up there, watch them.

415
00:39:06,158 --> 00:39:09,855
You said snipers AQl never
follow the Olympics?

416
00:39:09,895 --> 00:39:12,864
While lraq has not qualified
for three Olympics.

417
00:39:12,865 --> 00:39:15,891
Mustafa instead of lraq.

418
00:39:17,136 --> 00:39:19,104
He is from Syria.

419
00:39:30,149 --> 00:39:32,982
Once you get in, l could
not see anything.

420
00:39:32,985 --> 00:39:35,078
So only slowly.

421
00:39:35,154 --> 00:39:37,850
Good.

422
00:39:38,891 --> 00:39:40,882
Go!

423
00:39:57,976 --> 00:39:59,876
To hell with this.

424
00:40:00,112 --> 00:40:03,013
l will go down
with the marines .

425
00:40:03,115 --> 00:40:04,844
You coming?

426
00:40:05,017 --> 00:40:07,042
Not.

427
00:40:07,052 --> 00:40:10,988
l want to go home alive.

428
00:40:11,023 --> 00:40:16,086
Not work knocking on the door.
l do not want to do that.

429
00:40:16,095 --> 00:40:18,120
lf l do not see
you down there...

430
00:40:19,131 --> 00:40:22,032
... sure l will not
see you again.

431
00:40:27,873 --> 00:40:29,932
Hey, do you mind if
l come with you?

432
00:40:30,142 --> 00:40:32,940
Course.

433
00:40:34,012 --> 00:40:37,140
You're the legend that, right?
You've killed 24 people?

434
00:40:37,883 --> 00:40:39,942
- l do not count them.
- lt was really cool.

435
00:40:39,985 --> 00:40:42,146
There's a nigger in
Bravo the chase.

436
00:40:42,154 --> 00:40:45,089
l know a few things.

437
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:48,856
There are several things
that could show you, how?

438
00:40:48,994 --> 00:40:51,053
Okay.

439
00:40:55,868 --> 00:40:57,961
- What does that mean?
- Break.

440
00:41:04,109 --> 00:41:07,977
Get down on the floor right now!

441
00:41:09,081 --> 00:41:11,140
- Do not!
- Get down!

442
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:16,918
Why are you here? You
should evacuate.

443
00:41:16,955 --> 00:41:18,923
Who are you?

444
00:41:18,924 --> 00:41:21,154
l do not care about this house.

445
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,960
This is a war zone, sir. Down.

446
00:41:25,063 --> 00:41:26,928
Quick .

447
00:41:27,866 --> 00:41:29,026
They hide behind.

448
00:41:30,936 --> 00:41:32,904
Still no one else in this house?

449
00:41:33,906 --> 00:41:36,966
He's going to blow us.

450
00:41:36,975 --> 00:41:38,875
Search the clothes.

451
00:41:38,911 --> 00:41:42,142
- He knows we're talking.
- Who are you talking about?

452
00:41:42,147 --> 00:41:45,014
Who knew we talk?

453
00:41:45,017 --> 00:41:49,954

Okay, take him. Put your

Now! Fast!

457
00:42:06,104 --> 00:42:07,969
Take him into another room.

458
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,110
lf he spoke, a man will
come to his house.

459
00:42:17,149 --> 00:42:19,083
Who is ''he?''

460
00:42:23,889 --> 00:42:28,019
Someone called Butcher.
A son of the devil.

461
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,960
He was a bouncer?

462
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:33,955

head if not for us. - True.

701
01:03:50,074 --> 01:03:53,908
He invites you to dinner Eid.

He said on this day everything

He was really sweet.

Yes. This chili.

706
01:04:23,874 --> 01:04:25,967
Soaked overnight.

707
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:27,978
Then just add vodka.

708
01:04:28,012 --> 01:04:31,971
- That's the point.
- Just do it.

709
01:04:32,016 --> 01:04:34,883
Well, the food is delicious.

710
01:04:37,955 --> 01:04:40,014
That's a good question.

711
01:04:40,057 --> 01:04:42,025
All these people.

712
01:04:50,935 --> 01:04:53,870
Gosh.

725
01:06:50,087 --> 01:06:54,023
Well, you tell him that
he would go to jail ,

that would do to her ,

727
01:06:57,027 --> 01:06:59,120
or she can help us look for
the man in the restaurant.

728
01:06:59,897 --> 01:07:01,888
Tell him, it's his choice.

729
01:07:33,964 --> 01:07:35,989
That's it.

730
01:07:36,934 --> 01:07:38,993
Safe.

She moves.

01:08:08,065 --> 01:08:10,056

01:08:28,118 --> 01:08:30,086
He knocks.

739
01:08:34,892 --> 01:08:36,883
Wait.

Beagles, nothing

745
01:09:04,121 --> 01:09:06,112
No, he did not move.

01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:19,898
- D, put him down.
- Okay.

747

We found something,
carefully, remain vigilant.

749
01:09:33,050 --> 01:09:35,917
Enemies come!

01:09:44,895 --> 01:09:47,056

Butchers shot, to your position.

We've told him, it's his choice.

758
01:11:22,926 --> 01:11:25,952
He chose the wrong
side, it's his choice.

759
01:11:28,165 --> 01:11:32,124
Hey, Chris, Clean up all, we

Well, it is.

When did it begin?

Even when you're here,

l see you, l feel you.

820
01:16:20,090 --> 01:16:22,115
But you're not here.

l hate that team.

822
01:16:43,113 --> 01:16:45,081
True.

823
01:16:45,081 --> 01:16:47,072
You're my husband.

You're the father of my children,

They can not wait,

lf you think this war not

You can just walk in circles.

828
01:17:25,989 --> 01:17:28,014
That's right.

829
01:17:44,908 --> 01:17:47,138

- Where? From here?
- Yes, cheaper here.

You buy it from the collector? How do
you know there is no blood in the ring?

834
01:18:01,091 --> 01:18:05,858
What do you care? You killed
many here, you legend.

835
01:18:05,895 --> 01:18:08,989
- Not to ring.
- What is the problem?

836
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:12,933

- Do not get too close.
- Okay, you tell him.

838

- You tell him where did you get it? - Of

Half a block in the back.
We are ready.

away at the reunion.

843
01:18:32,922 --> 01:18:35,015
You're going to marry him.

844
01:18:35,091 --> 01:18:37,889
As long as she can
cook and clean.

845

- There they are.
- Oh My.

846

They have people

847
01:18:51,975 --> 01:18:54,967
They are the Al-Qaeda-like
everything.

848

01:19:49,899 --> 01:19:52,060
There is only one companion.

852
01:19:58,875 --> 01:20:00,900
Beacon 1 being fired!

853
01:20:00,977 --> 01:20:03,002
- Come on, give me a shot of protection.
- Okay.

Not. Prepare security.

863
01:21:05,008 --> 01:21:07,841
- Now l'm a little concerned.
- lt should.

864
01:21:07,877 --> 01:21:10,004
You mean she can keep
track of diamonds?

865
01:21:10,013 --> 01:21:12,038
l think so.

866
01:21:14,117 --> 01:21:16,984
Are you okay?

01:22:26,956 --> 01:22:28,981
Hold, Beagles.

879
01:22:31,894 --> 01:22:34,055
- Calm.
- l am sorry.

880
01:22:34,063 --> 01:22:36,088
For what? Why are
you apologizing?

881
01:22:36,099 --> 01:22:39,000
- lt was my fault, we go up to the roof.
- l'm going to die?

882
01:22:39,135 --> 01:22:41,899
No, Beagles. You Frogman.

883
01:22:41,904 --> 01:22:45,032
Frogman not die. He would
put sand in the wound,

884
01:22:45,108 --> 01:22:48,874
and enter the water, you're
fine, Beagles. Hold on.

885
01:22:48,878 --> 01:22:51,847
Hey, Chris. Make sure
he can ring it, okay?

886
01:22:51,914 --> 01:22:53,882
Course.

887
01:22:57,887 --> 01:23:00,048
Raise suction.

888
01:23:00,923 --> 01:23:03,118
Blood again. How much longer?

889
01:23:03,126 --> 01:23:06,892
We need 3 units of blood.

890
01:23:06,996 --> 01:23:08,054
Now.

891
01:23:08,097 --> 01:23:10,861
- Vacuum.
- Put it here.

892
01:23:10,933 --> 01:23:13,060
Press firmly!

893
01:23:13,870 --> 01:23:15,861
The blood less quickly.

894
01:23:23,980 --> 01:23:26,005
Did you see the shooter?

895
01:23:26,115 --> 01:23:28,913
No, the distance is
1000 meters more.

896
01:23:29,052 --> 01:23:31,953
No one can shoot that far.

897
01:23:33,156 --> 01:23:36,956
- She will survive?
- He is being treated.

898
01:23:37,927 --> 01:23:41,021
- That's not good.
- He was shot in the vitals.

899
01:23:41,998 --> 01:23:43,932
Fuck!

900
01:23:44,934 --> 01:23:48,870
We have to find that person.

901
01:23:48,938 --> 01:23:51,907
The units are still
looking for that person.

902
01:23:51,974 --> 01:23:54,135
l understand if you do not
want to continue and gather .

903
01:23:54,143 --> 01:23:56,907
lt's up to you.

904
01:23:56,979 --> 01:23:59,038
You're the leader.

905
01:23:59,115 --> 01:24:01,948
Eye to eye.

906
01:24:06,055 --> 01:24:08,114
We will be back.

907
01:24:08,157 --> 01:24:10,955
- Good.
- Of course.

908
01:24:11,027 --> 01:24:12,961
Come on.

909
01:24:13,996 --> 01:24:15,964
l participated.

910
01:24:44,994 --> 01:24:46,962
Hey!

911
01:24:49,132 --> 01:24:51,123
2 kilometers to the south.

912
01:25:20,963 --> 01:25:23,090
ln the left.

913
01:25:26,869 --> 01:25:29,030
Hallway.

914
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:33,133
Hallway safe. On the left.

915
01:25:35,044 --> 01:25:37,069
Safe.

916
01:25:37,113 --> 01:25:39,877
Everything is safe.

917
01:25:43,052 --> 01:25:45,043
Everything is safe.

918
01:25:45,922 --> 01:25:48,948
Mark, there seems
to be a rush to go.

919
01:25:56,065 --> 01:25:59,057
- Get down!
- Stay away from windows!

920
01:25:59,902 --> 01:26:01,961
Stay away from the window!

921
01:26:12,882 --> 01:26:14,042
Come on, Mark.

922
01:26:16,152 --> 01:26:18,950
Come on, friends. l got you.

923
01:26:18,955 --> 01:26:20,980
Look at me.

924
01:26:22,058 --> 01:26:23,992
l was here.

925
01:26:33,035 --> 01:26:35,060
Mark died, bro.

926
01:26:36,973 --> 01:26:39,134
There are shot, l need
help immediately.

927
01:26:40,009 --> 01:26:42,068
We have to move it.

928
01:26:50,152 --> 01:26:56,091
Victory, some people after
him, and some people stumble.

929
01:26:56,959 --> 01:26:59,018
Do not expect to find them.

930
01:26:59,128 --> 01:27:02,097
But everyone...

931
01:27:02,131 --> 01:27:05,862
good people stumble.
My question...

932
01:27:05,968 --> 01:27:10,029
When did it disappear victory
and become a safety?

933
01:27:10,873 --> 01:27:13,000
Or then it becomes...

934
01:27:13,042 --> 01:27:17,035
The spending someone who l...

935
01:27:18,114 --> 01:27:20,912
Love in the war.

936
01:27:21,050 --> 01:27:23,041
And l saw...

937
01:27:25,054 --> 01:27:27,989
Ready!

938
01:27:29,058 --> 01:27:31,083
Lift arms!

939
01:27:32,128 --> 01:27:35,029
Ready! Aim!

940
01:27:35,965 --> 01:27:37,933
Shoot!

941
01:27:37,934 --> 01:27:39,868
Ready!

942
01:27:39,869 --> 01:27:42,133
Aim! Shoot!

943
01:27:42,905 --> 01:27:45,135
Ready! Aim!

944
01:27:45,975 --> 01:27:49,968
Shoot! Lower arms.

945
01:28:44,033 --> 01:28:46,092
Mark wrote the letter
two weeks ago.

946
01:28:49,071 --> 01:28:51,938
He told you?

947
01:28:59,982 --> 01:29:02,917
Chris, l want to know what
you think about his .

948
01:29:04,086 --> 01:29:07,920
Dinner was cold, and...

949
01:29:08,090 --> 01:29:12,993
Beagles just been shot,
and we were ambushed.

950
01:29:13,929 --> 01:29:16,056
But, is not that strange.

951
01:29:17,133 --> 01:29:19,931
Letter was killed Mark.

952
01:29:20,002 --> 01:29:23,938
He just... he died, and
he paid the price.

953
01:29:35,084 --> 01:29:37,052
Signature here.

954
01:29:47,963 --> 01:29:49,931

- Damn, you're blind as a bat.
- Yes, bullets jerk.

958
01:29:57,973 --> 01:29:59,941
They said they
would fix my face.

959
01:29:59,975 --> 01:30:03,035
Fortunately, we
tell them to fix .

960
01:30:03,045 --> 01:30:04,910
Seriously.

961
01:30:05,047 --> 01:30:07,140
- Too fast?
- Too fast.

962
01:30:07,149 --> 01:30:10,118
- Hey, l heard you apply.
- Yes l Do.

963
01:30:10,152 --> 01:30:12,120
Congratulations.

964
01:30:12,121 --> 01:30:14,089
You did not tell him
that you buy diamonds

965
01:30:14,123 --> 01:30:16,887
- in that place, is not it?
- Do Not.

966
01:30:16,892 --> 01:30:19,019
- No?
- Do Not. l bought a new one.

967
01:30:20,062 --> 01:30:22,997

He will not leave me, bro.

970
01:30:29,905 --> 01:30:31,998
l told him to go,
he did not want to.

971
01:30:33,008 --> 01:30:35,841
He wants to be with me.

972
01:30:36,145 --> 01:30:38,136
Why do you say that?

973
01:30:38,147 --> 01:30:40,911
Do not say that, he loves you.

974
01:30:42,952 --> 01:30:45,921
- She was in love with you.
-Are you kidding.

975
01:30:47,890 --> 01:30:50,882
Yes, l'm glad l have it.

976
01:30:50,993 --> 01:30:53,985
- l know you can handle it.
- Maybe you're right.

977
01:30:55,097 --> 01:30:58,897
They say you deadliest sniper
in US military history.

978
01:30:58,934 --> 01:31:01,061
- Really?
- That's what l heard.

979
01:31:03,139 --> 01:31:06,006
- You heard them say that?
- Yes l Do.

980
01:31:06,041 --> 01:31:08,976
- You're not going back.
- Yes, we will hunt him down.

981
01:31:09,011 --> 01:31:12,037
- Come on, you do not need to do that.
- We have to do it.

982
01:31:12,882 --> 01:31:16,045
You're my brother, and they had to
pay for what they've done to you.

983
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:20,850
How are you going to do?

984
01:31:21,023 --> 01:31:23,048
There mad.

985
01:31:28,931 --> 01:31:30,956
He survived.

986
01:31:31,066 --> 01:31:33,864
He'll be fine.

987
01:31:33,903 --> 01:31:35,996
He did apply.

988
01:31:38,140 --> 01:31:41,007
Do you want to die?

989
01:31:41,043 --> 01:31:43,011
lf that's what you want.

990
01:31:43,045 --> 01:31:45,013
What?

991
01:31:45,114 --> 01:31:47,878
Tell me.

992
01:31:48,150 --> 01:31:51,881
Why did you do it? l

993
01:31:51,921 --> 01:31:54,014
l do for you, l do
to protect you.

994
01:31:54,023 --> 01:31:56,082
- No.
- Yes l Do.

995
01:31:56,125 --> 01:32:00,994

your children no father.

996
01:32:00,996 --> 01:32:04,090
- l have to serve my country.
- That's nonsense!

997
01:32:04,099 --> 01:32:07,000
- No.
- You do not know when to stop.

998
01:32:08,904 --> 01:32:12,135
You've done yourjob, you're pretty
sacrifice, let someone else have a go.

999
01:32:12,141 --> 01:32:14,109
- Let someone else go?
- Yes l Do.

1000
01:32:14,143 --> 01:32:17,010
- l could not live.
- You've got to find a way.

1001
01:32:17,913 --> 01:32:20,040
You should do it.

1002
01:32:24,053 --> 01:32:28,012
Okay? l want you
to be human again.

1003
01:32:30,092 --> 01:32:32,959
l need you here.

1004
01:32:33,963 --> 01:32:36,898
They need you here.

1005
01:32:39,034 --> 01:32:41,059
lf you go again...

1006
01:32:42,137 --> 01:32:45,004
l guess we will not be there
here when you return.

1007
01:33:11,867 --> 01:33:13,095
Chris.

1008
01:33:14,136 --> 01:33:17,105
We have 3 missions in a row.

1009
01:33:17,106 --> 01:33:20,075
lt would be worse.

1010
01:33:20,109 --> 01:33:23,078
- lt will be chaotic.
-Are you coming?

1011
01:33:23,112 --> 01:33:25,080
l think so.

1012
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:27,981
His wife scolded him.

1013
01:33:27,983 --> 01:33:32,852
Once again my wife will kill me.

1014
01:33:32,855 --> 01:33:35,085
- True.
- They do not understand.

1015
01:33:35,124 --> 01:33:39,151
l went to the hospital
earlier, it was bad.

1016
01:33:39,995 --> 01:33:41,986
He was already dead, Chris.

1017
01:33:42,998 --> 01:33:47,128
He was operated on yesterday,
die on the operating table.

1018
01:33:54,943 --> 01:33:58,879
lt Taya, leave a message.

1019

01:34:07,022 --> 01:34:09,889
Tell the kids l love them .

l love you too.

1023
01:35:37,012 --> 01:35:39,071
Place.

1024
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:54,857
Come on.

1025
01:36:22,124 --> 01:36:28,893
Look, they believe it will
be able to help us win war.

1026
01:36:28,931 --> 01:36:34,028
Problem engineers designed so as
not to be defeated by a sniper.

1027
01:36:34,036 --> 01:36:35,128
Where?

1028
01:36:35,971 --> 01:36:39,031
-Approximately 100 miles.
- There is something else?

1029
01:36:39,074 --> 01:36:42,009
- l do not know.
- Snipers will kill us.

1030
01:36:42,044 --> 01:36:45,138
He could be anyone. We
just have to kill him.

1031
01:36:45,147 --> 01:36:50,949
We've blocked 6 blocks from the
North region enemy, you will be in
front of the shooterjitunya.

1032
01:36:50,986 --> 01:36:54,080
- ln the middle of the desert storm?
- Bring your sunglasses.

1033
01:36:54,122 --> 01:36:58,024
We must kill the sniper.
Understand?

1034
01:36:58,026 --> 01:37:02,019
- Be prepared.
- Yes, Sir.

1035
01:39:07,055 --> 01:39:11,890
- Safe.
- Going down. Come on.

1036
01:39:11,994 --> 01:39:13,154
Come on.

1037
01:39:18,033 --> 01:39:21,093
Safe. The Way.

1038
01:39:24,139 --> 01:39:27,939
Everything is safe.
Building is safe.

1039
01:40:06,948 --> 01:40:10,111
There were coming. Hold shot.

1040
01:40:19,127 --> 01:40:22,096
ln the middle of a desert storm.

1041
01:41:01,103 --> 01:41:04,004
- Caution!
- Take cover!

1042
01:41:06,875 --> 01:41:10,902
Shit. The shot of the East.

1043
01:41:16,051 --> 01:41:19,020
We are in the wrong position.

1044
01:41:20,088 --> 01:41:25,025
Not important. Hold fire.
There are people below us.

1045
01:41:57,025 --> 01:41:59,926
There is a target at 19 yards.

1046
01:41:59,928 --> 01:42:03,989
l can not see that far. Hold shot.
We could get caught.

1047
01:42:04,032 --> 01:42:06,865
He's right, there's no point.

1048
01:42:06,868 --> 01:42:09,894
Correction, 21 yards.

1049
01:42:10,972 --> 01:42:13,907
More than 1 mile.
lmpossible to shoot, Chris.

1050
01:42:25,954 --> 01:42:27,922
That's it.

1051
01:42:29,057 --> 01:42:33,118
l've got a target, change.

1052
01:42:33,128 --> 01:42:36,962
Understandably, troops will
soon arrive in 20 minutes.

1053
01:42:52,013 --> 01:42:55,073
- He oversees our friends.

What are you doing?

1130
01:53:02,023 --> 01:53:04,890
l think it only took a minute.

1131
01:53:07,028 --> 01:53:12,056
Chris, children want to meet.
lt's been 9 months.

1132
01:53:19,974 --> 01:53:22,135

Okay.

1138
01:54:21,002 --> 01:54:24,961

Good. Looks different.

That would be great.

Crazy, right?

1146
01:55:01,042 --> 01:55:07,072
l go crazy when seeing
other children.

1147
01:55:08,049 --> 01:55:10,984
You could be the coach.

1148
01:55:13,888 --> 01:55:17,949
He will lose teeth, l
am a little anxious.

1149
01:55:17,992 --> 01:55:20,119
He says only you are
allowed to withdraw it.

1150
01:55:20,127 --> 01:55:22,118
Will you do it?

1151
01:55:39,981 --> 01:55:42,040
Chris?

1152
01:55:56,063 --> 01:55:59,931
l can pull out of
your wife's phone.

1153
01:55:59,934 --> 01:56:02,061
She stories about barbecue.

1154
01:56:03,070 --> 01:56:05,038
That's a pity.

1155
01:56:05,072 --> 01:56:08,872
lt seems out of control.
Are you worried?

1156
01:56:08,876 --> 01:56:10,070
No, sir.

1157
01:56:10,111 --> 01:56:13,979
So you do not worry
about that happening?

1158
01:56:13,981 --> 01:56:16,108
No, sir. l do not
worry about it.

1159
01:56:17,118 --> 01:56:19,951
l want to ask you, Chris.

1160
01:56:19,954 --> 01:56:22,013
How long did you

1161
01:56:22,890 --> 01:56:26,986
- 4 mission, so...
-Approximately a thousand days?

1162
01:56:27,028 --> 01:56:29,019
Yes, sir.

1163
01:56:29,864 --> 01:56:36,895
You'll be surprised if l tell
AL note you kill more than 160?

1164
01:56:37,138 --> 01:56:44,135
Ever thought do not
want you doing there?

1165
01:56:44,145 --> 01:56:46,909
That's not me.

1166
01:56:47,114 --> 01:56:48,877
What about you?

1167
01:56:48,883 --> 01:56:52,876
l'm just protecting my friends. They
are trying to kill our soldiers.

1168
01:56:52,920 --> 01:56:56,151
l am willing to die
to protect them.

1169
01:56:59,126 --> 01:57:04,996
The problem l feel sad for the
people who could not l save.

1170
01:57:06,934 --> 01:57:11,962
l want to be there,
but l'm here, stop.

1171
01:57:13,074 --> 01:57:15,872
So you want to save
even more people?

1172
01:57:16,877 --> 01:57:18,003
Yes, sir.

1173
01:57:19,880 --> 01:57:22,974
You should go from here.

1174
01:57:23,050 --> 01:57:25,985
There are many soldiers
who had to be rescued.

1175
01:57:31,025 --> 01:57:35,052
- Want to take a walk?
- Sure.

1176
01:57:35,062 --> 01:57:38,896
Okay. l want to
show you something.

because save my right hand.

1178
01:57:46,941 --> 01:57:48,101
How can it be?

before it exploded,
my right hand

1181
01:57:56,083 --> 01:58:00,884

When l turned it on...

Destroy entire left arm.

1183
01:58:05,993 --> 01:58:09,019

1187
01:58:28,115 --> 01:58:30,083
3 inches to the right?

1188
01:58:31,018 --> 01:58:33,009
lt is quite complicated.

1189
01:58:33,020 --> 01:58:37,013
Vibration surprise. Not
like shooting paper.

1190
01:58:37,057 --> 01:58:41,118
- You can not confuse me?
- Kenai only target.

1191
01:58:42,963 --> 01:58:45,056
- Kena.

Shit, as had the courage back.

1193
01:58:50,104 --> 01:58:52,971
Why did you do it?

1194
01:58:53,007 --> 01:58:57,103
- l know you have a family.
- l hear you collect shoes.

1195
01:58:57,111 --> 01:59:00,103

Really, why did you do it?

1197
01:59:03,951 --> 01:59:06,078
We look after each other, right?

1198
01:59:06,153 --> 01:59:08,917
Try shooting again.

1199
01:59:10,090 --> 01:59:12,058
Come on, you can.

1200
01:59:13,894 --> 01:59:16,021

Who is legend now?

1203
01:59:26,874 --> 01:59:30,139
You do not want that title.
Trust.

1204
01:59:34,982 --> 01:59:37,883
Help me.

1205
01:59:40,888 --> 01:59:43,118

He smiled.

Looks happy.

1211
02:00:21,028 --> 02:00:23,053
Just do the habit.

1212
02:00:25,933 --> 02:00:27,901
Not think of the other.

1213
02:00:37,144 --> 02:00:39,908

1214
02:00:39,914 --> 02:00:44,010

Yes.

1219
02:00:59,967 --> 02:01:02,993
That's what we'll do
for the first time.

1220

Okay.
