Why don't you ever talk about Samoa?

179
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:37,637
Did something happen?

180
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,931
In life, things happen.

181
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:43,851
You may not want them to, but they do.

182
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:47,939
You just gotta do your best...

183
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,942
and move on.

184
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:54,195
And the fact of the matter is
I'm your family.

185
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,823
I'm your people. Me.

186
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:59,242
- And you're a whole lot.
- Oh, I am a whole lot.

187
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,661
- [chuckles]
- [Hobbs] Look at this. Perfect timing.

188
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:05,081
Oh, no, this is the mini.

189
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,792
- Yup.
- Thank you so much.

190
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:11,003
- Cheat day?
- Cheat day. Yeah.

191
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:12,213
Thank you so much.

192
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:17,134
Is that really necessary?

193
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:20,263
Come on! She's 71 years old.
What's the matter with you lot?

194
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:23,349
Sir, the prisoner will
only be allowed more leniency

195
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,768
when she proves
to be less of a security risk.

196
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:28,938
If someone leaves a back door open,
it's a bit daft not to try and use it.

197
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,482
What's daft is paying
one of the screws to leave it open

198
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:33,294
but not paying them enough
to keep their mouth shut.

199
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,444
Yeah, well, my point still stands.

200
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,822
If you can't break out
of a shitty prison like this,

201
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,365
then you're seriously slipping, Mum.

202
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:40,950
You cheeky bugger.

203
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,202
Speaking of breaking out,
where's my birthday cake?

204
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:45,788
The one with the file in it?
They're baking it.

205
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:48,666
Who wants a bloody file?
What I want is a nice little bit of C-4.

206
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,296
Listen, if you want out of here,
just say the word. I'll handle it.

207
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,220
Oh, Decks,
I'm just having a bit of fun really.

208
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:58,926
Being banged up doesn't bother me.
I quite enjoy the peace and quiet.

209
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:02,346
You know, nice walk,
bit of reading, loads of sudoku.

210
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,640
It's like being retired. Love it.

211
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:08,895
Now listen,
have you spoken with your sister?

212
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:10,396
You know I haven't, Mum.

213
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,916
- Give me your hand.
- There she goes.

214
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,942
I mean, you and your sister,
you used to be inseparable.

215
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:17,361
What happened, Decks?
What happened between you?

216
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:21,324
I remember you, Owen, and Hattie
playing out in the backyard.

217
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:25,328
Your little games, your little grifts.
Robbing banks.

218
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,371
You used to give
your little scams code names.

219
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:28,456
Do you remember?

220
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,833
- Oh, what was that one?
- The "Keith Moon."

221
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:35,023
[Magdalene] Yeah, that's right. It was
called the "Keith Moon" because it...

222
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:38,591
It involved lots of explosive percussion
and permanent ear damage.

223
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:42,678
♪ Yeah! ♪

224
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:47,683
[laughs]

225
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,268
That's my boy.

226
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:51,437
No wonder we left the family business.

227
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:52,772
She loves you, you know?

228
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:55,691
All you gotta do
is pick up the phone, Decks.

229
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:58,486
Look at me. You're her big brother.

230
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:00,488
She looks up to you.

231
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:01,864
Used to.

232
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:09,956
Well, one day, I just hope
that I walk through that door

233
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,958
and I see the two of you sitting there.

234
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:13,542
How many years you got left?

235
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:15,544
Two, with good behavior.

236
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,713
- So how many, really?
- Four.

237
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,884
Well, you know what they say.

238
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:23,678
"Never say 'never."'

239
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,930
[guard] Time's up.

240
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:27,556
You behave yourself.

241
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:29,767
Will do. Love you, darling. [kisses]

242
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:31,143
Love you too. [kisses]

243
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,232
[Magdalene laughs]

244
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:48,786
- All right.
- [man] Lucas Rebecca Hobbs.

245
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,372
I haven't seen you in forever.

246
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,958
- "Rebecca"?
- Do you even age? How long's it been?

247
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:56,210
- Six months.
- Time flies.

248
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:58,921
- When we're apart.
- What is your skin care regimen?

249
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:01,841
Because you look
like a young Shirley Temple.

250
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:04,260
- Go, go, go, go, go.
- Daddy, who is this guy?

251
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:07,221
Well, this guy is Locke.

252
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,307
And he works for the CIA.

253
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:12,245
- Your dad and I are old friends.
- We're not old friends.

254
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:13,310
Actually, we're...

255
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:15,623
We're best friends. Here's the half heart.

256
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:16,939
I don't know what that is.

257
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:19,168
- We got some ink together as well.
- We did not get ink together.

258
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,776
- Oh, we didn't?
- No, we did not.

259
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:22,922
- Interesting. I seem to remember...
- We never got ink together.

260
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:26,782
Getting a little something like this
at one point on my body.

261
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,951
- Jesus.
- Christ, I miss our playful banter.

262
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:30,680
You have one minute
to tell me what you want

263
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,098
before I knock one of your lungs loose.

264
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:33,873
You and I are after the same thing.

265
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:36,000
Say hello to the CT-17 virus.

266
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:39,170
It's a programmable bioweapon
of biblical proportions.

267
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:41,714
Affectionately code-named "the Snowflake."

268
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:42,923
What does the Snowflake do?

269
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:45,843
Oh, nothing much.
Just liquefies your internal organs.

270
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:48,679
Basically turns your body
into a giant bag of hot soup.

271
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:49,930
She is nine.

272
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:51,432
- Seen worse.
- Where?

273
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:52,892
Game of Thrones. Janet's house.

274
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:54,954
- I've never heard of it.
- A Lannister always pays his debts.

275
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:56,771
You're never going over there again.

276
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:58,898
But there's a new
wrinkle in the case, Rebecca.

277
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:02,735
The specifics... are all in the brief.

278
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,111
There you go.

279
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:06,530
- She's ready, Becca.
- She's nine. She's nine!

280
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:09,658
This is the only unit of CT-17
in existence,

281
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:14,288
and this Snowflake is now in the hands
of a rogue MI6 operative in London.

282
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:15,873
Dad, are all spies that pretty?

283
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:19,502
No. She is unusually attractive.

284
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,045
And deadly.

285
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:24,173
Last night she was part of an Ml6 team
tasked with securing the virus.

286
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,842
She then proceeded to kill
her entire black ops squad.

287
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:30,387
She stabbed one guy in the chest
using a brick.

288
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:31,972
Do you know how hard that is?

289
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:33,808
To stab someone using a brick?

290
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:36,120
- Get to the point.
- The point is there's no sharp edge.

291
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:38,687
How did she get an entire brick
into another person's chest?

292
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,272
She either had to be really strong

293
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:43,734
or the other person had to have been,
like, born without, like, bones.

294
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:46,362
- Get to the larger point.
- She stole the Snowflake.

295
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,489
- She went totally off-grid.
- Who's this?

296
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,533
That's the scientist
we believe created the virus.

297
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,368
Great. Where do I find him?

298
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,954
He's off-grid too.
Impossible to find. Maybe dead.

299
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:58,040
- You're very helpful, Locke.
- And you're the world's best tracker.

300
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,834
I'm sure you'll figure something out.

301
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:03,212
Oh, no, no, no. I'm DSS, you're CIA.
I don't work for you.

302
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,881
Your boss loaned you out.
You do now, dickface.

303
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:07,276
- What'd you just call me?
- Hey, hey, hey!

304
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,759
Let's just settle down. All right?

305
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:10,613
We've already got
a black site running in London.

306
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:13,305
There's an operative there.
Top of his game. He’ll be your contact.

307
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,015
I don't need anybody else. I work alone.

308
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,226
We got bigger problems
than your fragile ego,

309
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,271
or the fact that a moment ago
I most definitely shit my pants.

310
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:24,316
The entire world
is at stake here, all right?

311
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:26,986
This thing gets out, we're looking at
a lot of liquefied organs,

312
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,988
and I mean, like, everywhere.

313
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:30,990
And not just yours and mine.

314
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,869
Uh... He knows I can see him, right?

315
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:38,789
He knows nothing, Jon Snow.

316
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,292
[Sam chuckles]

317
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:42,793
So what's it gonna be, Becky?

318
00:16:42,878 --> 00:16:44,211
You gonna partner up?

319
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:47,548
- I'm in.
- Of course you are.

320
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:48,985
Do you remember what I told you in Rwanda?

321
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,843
- "It still burns"?
- No, the other thing.

322
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,761
- "Stop watching me sleep."
- I said:

323
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:56,098
- "We are not friends at all."
- We're best friends.

324
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:58,142
- And to watch your back.
- Wash your back, yeah.

325
00:16:58,226 --> 00:16:59,727
- Oh, I remember.
- Watch your back.

326
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,103
Lot of back. I got you.

327
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:03,480
Hey. Same old Hobbs, huh?

328
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:04,607
Same old Locke.

329
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,360
All right. Who's on the case?

330
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,407
[man speaking indistinctly over PA]

331
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:18,829
- Mr. Shaw.
- Whatever it is, I ain't buying it.

332
00:17:18,914 --> 00:17:20,706
You don't know what I'm selling,
or who I am.

333
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,790
CIA.

334
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:25,586
- How could you...
- Sunglasses, cloudy day, sensible shoes.

335
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:29,340
I have fallen arches, and I don't have
a lot of choice in what I...

336
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:31,819
Anyway, I'm Agent Loeb, and I need
to talk to you about our shared interest.

337
00:17:31,843 --> 00:17:32,843
How'd you find me?

338
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:35,930
I got a tip from an acquaintance of yours:
Mr. Nobody.

339
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:37,097
Mr. Nobody.

340
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,266
Little joke for you, Loeb.

341
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:43,229
What do CIA operatives
and baseballs have in common?

342
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:45,564
People cheer when you hit them with a bat.

343
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:46,649
No.

344
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:49,985
They are two things
I don't give a toss about.

345
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:52,529
That works too.

346
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:01,080
The weapon she's stolen
is not like anything we've ever seen.

347
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:04,500
It's a programmable disease
that can target any DNA sequence

348
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:07,670
with a 100% mortality rate
inside 72 hours.

349
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:11,006
If MI6 finds her,
they're gonna treat her like a traitor.

350
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:13,259
[man on phone]
We need you to surrender the virus.

351
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:15,678
What is your location?

352
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:19,640
What, you think I killed them?

353
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:22,643
[Loeb] But if you help us find her,
if you bring us the virus,

354
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:24,603
we'll grant her immunity.

355
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:30,276
We've set up a black site here in London.

356
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,463
You've got everything you could need
at your disposal,

357
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:35,072
and we're bringing in an asset
from the States to assist you.

358
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:36,532
I don't need anybody.

359
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,158
Maybe not, Mr. Shaw.

360
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:39,868
But she does.

361
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,417
- My guy's in.
- My guy's in too.

362
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:49,146
Is your guy gonna freak out
when he finds out who my guy is?

363
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,010
Didn't they just do a job
together in New York?

364
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:53,173
Didn't they just destroy
the DSS field office in LA

365
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:54,800
by throwing each other through it?

366
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:57,594
I don't know. Look,
I don't know about your guy, but my guy?

367
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,949
He's gonna get this.
He's gonna pull this off. You know why?

368
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:02,433
We've been best friends
our whole goddamn lives.

369
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:06,395
Well, my guy beat the shit out of me
at a bar in Kraków 17 years ago,

370
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,105
and he doesn't even remember me.

371
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:10,607
So we all have our histories.

372
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:12,401
Anyway, it's the fate of the world here.

373
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:13,565
It's the fate of the world.

374
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,654
The planet's population is in their hands.

375
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:16,822
Serious stuff.

376
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:19,992
You'd think they'd be able to put aside
any petty rivalries to save the world.

377
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,201
- Mm. Mm.
- [slurping]

378
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,287
- No fucking way.
- No fucking way.

379
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:25,789
I'm not working with this guy.
I've been there, done that.

380
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:28,625
The minute he gets involved,
you can kiss goodbye to any finesse,

381
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,086
because She-Hulk here
only knows how to smash.

382
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:33,630
And Mr. Arson here
only knows how to blow shit up.

383
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:35,067
- The fact is...
- And the fact is...

384
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:36,717
- no offense...
- oh, no offense...

385
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:39,041
- this guy's a real asshole.
- This guy's a real asshole.

386
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:42,973
That's "sumbitch" in your native tongue.

387
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:45,267
That'd be "wanker" in your native tongue.

388
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:48,270
Are you finished blubbering?
You sound like a giant tattooed baby.

389
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:51,065
I'm not listening to this horseshit.
I got a job to do.

390
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:55,569
Tell your mom I said hi.
Actually, I'll tell her myself.

391
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:58,573
Don't you ever talk about my mother.
I'll put your head through that wall.

392
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:02,326
Secondly, I'll have this job done while
you're still putting on your baby oil.

393
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,494
Good luck, slick.

394
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:06,497
- [snaps fingers]
- That's it. You just reminded me.

395
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:09,583
That's exactly why
I hate working with you.

396
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:11,585
It's your voice.

397
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:16,048
It's your nasally, prepubescent,
Harry Potter voice.

398
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:19,176
Every time you speak,
just imagine this for a second,

399
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,347
it's like dragging my balls
across shattered glass.

400
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,517
- And it hurts.
- Well, for me,

401
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:28,602
it's not your voice.

402
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:30,521
It's your face.

403
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:33,065
Your big, stupid face.

404
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:34,775
Looking at it makes me feel

405
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:38,695
like God is projectile vomiting
right in my eyes.

406
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:40,906
And it burns.

407
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,867
It really burns.

408
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,455
What you gonna do now?
Throw a bit of furniture?

409
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,227
For your information, I was gonna
take this chair and turn it sideways

410
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:53,460
and shove it right down your throat.

411
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:55,865
Of course you are,
'cause that's your answer to everything.

412
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:58,799
Smash a hole through every problem
in a massive truck.

413
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:00,820
- That's not gonna work here.
- I think it'll work fine.

414
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:04,179
Guys, why don't you two take a seat
and we'll talk through this?

415
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:10,602
Me and you? Us? I've been down this road.

416
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:12,104
It's a total waste of time.

417
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:13,666
For once, I couldn't agree with you more.

418
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,274
Yeah? Well, I'm doing this my way.

419
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:19,611
If anyone's got a problem with that,
I suggest you come out here and stop me.

420
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:21,238
I'm not going in there.

421
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:22,573
Well, I'm not going in there.

422
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:24,241
Smart lads.

423
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:37,337
All right, now that we got rid of
that fun sponge, we can get to work.

424
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:40,257
I want you to pull up every CCTV camera
around central London.

425
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:42,342
We already have two dozen agents
scouring footage.

426
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:44,678
Don't you talk back to me, Opie. Uh-uh.

427
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:47,602
I just care about the coverage.
I ain't gonna ask you again. Pull it up.

428
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:52,895
Now zoom in on the area of the heist.

429
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:58,734
Now invert it. Highlight the areas
that the cameras don't cover.

430
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:02,613
She's smart.

431
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,658
She just killed her entire team
and stole a deadly virus.

432
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:09,578
She ain't waiting around for no picture.

We do this the hard way or the easy way.

- I am.

- Really?
- Yes.

479
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:09,364
- Hmm. Well, it's a tough decision.
- No, it's really not.

00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:15,454
Fine.

483
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:19,583
But you're not gonna like what's in 'em.

484
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:23,670
- Think I made up my mind.
- You seem like a smart woman.

485
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:24,755
I am.

486
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:26,048

you didn't take it easy on me now.

I wish a lot of things right now.

505
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:14,239
You're going to go to sleep now.
It's all gonna seem like a bad dream.

506
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:15,949
It's more like a nightmare.

507
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:17,784
This whole thing is a nightmare.

508
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:22,873
All right,
let's me and you have a little chat.

00:26:49,901 --> 00:26:51,902
He has everything ready for you
in medical.

515
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:58,116
[director]
Perfection is a painful process, Brixton,

516
00:26:58,201 --> 00:27:01,411
in ourselves
and in the pursuit of a perfect world.

517
00:27:02,872 --> 00:27:06,500
Humanity must evolve
before it destroys itself.

518
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:11,129
Eteon will carve out all human weakness

519
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:13,715
and replace it with mechanical perfection.

520
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:16,301
And you will lead the way.

521
00:27:20,223 --> 00:27:21,515
I'm gonna ask you a question.

522
00:27:22,058 --> 00:27:23,391
It's not what you think it is.

523
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,143
Do you like to dance?

524
00:27:25,603 --> 00:27:27,312
What, the Electric Slide?

525
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:29,731
The Macarena? No, I don't.

526
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:33,151
No, no, no,
I was thinking about... the tango.

527
00:27:33,236 --> 00:27:35,946
- Where it takes two.
- Yeah, don't know that one.

528
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,447
Must be different generations.

529
00:27:37,532 --> 00:27:40,283
[laughs]

530
00:27:40,368 --> 00:27:44,663
Yeah, well, either way, the music started,
so let's see what kind of rhythm you have.

531
00:27:46,249 --> 00:27:47,768
- Where's the virus?
- Look, I told you,

532
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:49,812
- I've no idea what you're talking about.
- Okay, that hurt.

533
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:51,920
You just stepped on my toes,
that didn't feel good.

534
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:53,982
Let's try it again.
I think you're better than that.

535
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,132
- Where's the virus?
- I didn't ask to dance.

536
00:27:56,217 --> 00:27:57,977
And why should I talk to you?
You're not CIA.

537
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,177
No? How do you know that?

538
00:27:59,262 --> 00:28:00,470
Where shall I start?

539
00:28:01,055 --> 00:28:03,682
There's two types of CIA agents.
Intelligence and espionage.

540
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:05,577
Those guys over there
can barely lift a pencil.

541
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:07,162
That's what intelligence agents look like.

542
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:09,271
You look like you could
pick up a building.

543
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:12,107
But espionage is about blending in
and about being subtle,

544
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:16,194
and there is nothing subtle about you.

545
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:17,696
Yeah.

546
00:28:18,281 --> 00:28:19,322
That's good.

547
00:28:20,283 --> 00:28:22,033
- I'm impressed.
- I didn't kill anybody.

548
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:23,201
I know you didn't.

549
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:26,204
How do you know that, then?

550
00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:28,642
Because you can learn a lot about somebody
when you fight them.

551
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:32,210
And when we fought,
you weren't fighting to kill me.

552
00:28:32,295 --> 00:28:33,795
You were fighting to run away.

553
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:37,757
But either way, the world thinks that
you're a murderer and a thief,

554
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:40,153
so you're not going anywhere
or getting any goddamn phone call

555
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:41,530
until you give me some real answers.

556
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:43,115
You have no idea what is happening here.

557
00:28:43,139 --> 00:28:44,700
- Then tell me. Help me understand.
- I can't.

558
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:46,660
- You're wasting my time.
- I can't either... You're wasting time!

559
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:49,394
Virus gets in the wrong hands, that's it.
It's game over.

560
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:53,940
[alarm ringing]

561
00:28:55,443 --> 00:28:56,651
[chuckles]

562
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:02,908
Does that mean it's time for curls?

563
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:05,702
Just like the CIA,
always flexing the wrong muscle.

564
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:07,556
You know, the mind
is the strongest muscle in the body.

565
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,740
Maybe you should try
exercising that a little bit more.

566
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,919
"There's more wisdom in your body
than in your deepest philosophies."

567
00:29:14,003 --> 00:29:16,796
Let me guess. That Bruce Lee?

568
00:29:16,881 --> 00:29:18,882
[chuckles] No, Nietzsche.

569
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:20,800
'Cause I'm flexing this.

570
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:22,928
And all of that.

571
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:26,723
Come here.

572
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:29,809
If she moves, I want you to shoot her.

573
00:29:29,894 --> 00:29:30,894
Yeah, he can't shoot me.

574
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:33,188
- Yeah, not allowed.
- In the face.

575
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:34,472
You can't. You'd go to prison.

576
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:37,210
- You can shoot her right in the face.
- No, you can't. You'd go to prison. Sorry.

577
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:39,778
I want you to shoot her
two times right in that face.

578
00:29:41,322 --> 00:29:42,697
- Okay?
- Yeah.

579
00:29:49,664 --> 00:29:50,664
[Sam on phone] Hi, Dad.

580
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:52,165
Did you catch the hot spy lady?

581
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:54,459
Come on. It's me.
I catch everybody I hunt.

582
00:29:54,877 --> 00:29:56,294
How long have you been doing this?

583
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:59,965
'Cause you seem... new.

584
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:05,428
[groaning]

585
00:30:05,513 --> 00:30:06,888
She's actually quite annoying.

586
00:30:06,973 --> 00:30:10,183
You know, Dad,
sometimes people annoy each other

587
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:12,602
when they're actually, like, flirting.

588
00:30:12,687 --> 00:30:13,812
Where'd you hear that from?

589
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:20,276
Okay, look, me and the spy lady,
we're not flirting, all right?

590
00:30:20,361 --> 00:30:21,444
Zero chemistry.

591
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:23,238

[engine revs, shuts off]

594
00:30:36,127 --> 00:30:37,419
I don't know.

595
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:40,338
When you saw her photo,
you definitely gave the eyebrow.

596
00:30:40,423 --> 00:30:41,756
What eyebrow?

597
00:30:41,841 --> 00:30:44,467
- You know, Dad, that thing that you do.
- What thing?

598
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:47,429
- I don't do that.
- Yes, you do.

599
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:50,193
No, I definitely don't do that.
I don't even know what you're doing.

600
00:30:50,224 --> 00:30:52,225
That's the silliest thing I've ever seen.

601
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:54,229
Let me get going,
I got business to take care of.

602
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:56,688
I'll see you when I get home, okay?
I love you.

603
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:57,856
Love you.

604
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,065
Hey, one more thing.

This is not the dance
you wanna do with me, woman.

610
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:17,250
- Oh, really?
- I eat bullets all day long.

611
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:20,086
Oh, for breakfast and lunch?
'Cause it's dinnertime.

612
00:31:20,171 --> 00:31:21,546
I'll count down for you. Three...

613
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:23,590
- Two...
- [Shaw] Hobbs.

614
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:25,633
- [analyst] Freeze.
- Put that down.

615
00:31:25,718 --> 00:31:27,635
Get your greasy
sausage fingers off of her.

616
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,554
- What are you doing here?
- Saving you.

617
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:31,598
I don't need to be saved.

618
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:35,018
No, no. This is my house and your
goddamn girlfriend ain't going anywhere.

619
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:36,782
- That's disgusting.
- [Shaw] "Girlfriend"?

620
00:31:36,854 --> 00:31:38,521
That is my sister.

621
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:43,401
Bullshit. She's too good-looking
to be your sister.

622
00:31:43,486 --> 00:31:45,779
Very funny.
Hat, there are people after you.

623
00:31:45,863 --> 00:31:46,905
Believe me, I know that.

624
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:49,217
It's gonna stay that way
unless you tell me where that virus is.

625
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:52,619
Listen to me, pinhead. She's gonna die
if I don't get her out of here right now!

626
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:54,973
We're all gonna die if
she doesn't tell us where that weapon is.

627
00:31:54,997 --> 00:31:57,540
Actually, everyone's gonna die
'cause I am the virus!

628
00:31:58,292 --> 00:31:59,626
It's embedded in capsules.

629
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,252
I need to find a way to get them out.

Good to see you, Brixton.

- Lucky for you, I am.

Yeah.

- Nice suit.
- [Brixton] Bulletproof.

651
00:35:02,476 --> 00:35:04,246
- State of the art.
- [Shaw] Could've done with that

the last time I put a bullet in ya.

No, actually, it was three bullets.

Two to the chest, one to the head.
Just like they taught us. Do you remember?

It's a shame you didn't join Eteon.

- Yeah.

preserve her life and extract the virus.

Because it's impossible to get to.

848
00:45:59,466 --> 00:46:01,759
We'll decide what's impossible.

Well, who needs a drink?

855
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:21,779

Wow, look at all these.

860
00:46:42,759 --> 00:46:44,159
[Hobbs]
Somebody's overcompensating.

861
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:46,762
If anything, I'm under-compensating.

862
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:51,475
And a teeny-tiny one. Just your size.

863
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,354
[Shaw] Used it for a job over in Italy.

864
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:58,691
Shame we didn't need
a weightlifting bus driver.

865
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:00,651
Would've given you a call.

I'll write to someone in Moscow.
An old friend.

875
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,892
Yeah, we have a long history.

876
00:47:33,977 --> 00:47:36,228
She and her crew are paying a visit
to some locals.

877
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:38,063
Particular Russian criminal element.

878
00:47:38,148 --> 00:47:40,876
- They have things that we're gonna need.
- Considering your history with friends,

879
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,336
how many bullets you put
in this one's head?

880
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,840
They can set us up with gear,
and I don't hear any other ideas.

881
00:47:44,904 --> 00:47:48,073
We know getting out of this country
is gonna be extremely difficult.

882
00:47:48,158 --> 00:47:51,118
We have every major intelligence agency
already hunting us down.

883
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:54,621
And there's the fact that you disgraced
MI6 when you betrayed your team.

884
00:48:01,463 --> 00:48:03,547
Don't believe everything they tell you.

885
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:06,175

887
00:48:11,431 --> 00:48:13,284
No, regular back channels
aren't gonna work this time.

888
00:48:13,308 --> 00:48:14,869
We're gonna have to
do our best to blend in.

889
00:48:14,893 --> 00:48:16,185
[Hattie] Hide in plain sight.

890
00:48:16,269 --> 00:48:18,395
- That's why we'll be flying commercial.
- Commercial?

891
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,080
- We're gonna get spotted too easy at...
- [camera shutter clicks]

892
00:48:21,608 --> 00:48:23,776
Don't worry that pea-sized brain.
I handled it.

893
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:25,819
Cloned our cell phone signals
around the world.

894
00:48:25,904 --> 00:48:27,863
Should buy us at least 48 hours.

895
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:29,592
We'll pick up new gear
when we get to Moscow.

896
00:48:29,616 --> 00:48:31,696
Should get us past the wandering eyes
at the airport.

897
00:48:32,285 --> 00:48:34,745
This is probably the only thing
that's gonna fit.

898
00:48:36,164 --> 00:48:37,372
Fit what, a Smurf?

899
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:39,333
I think that's one of my old ones.

900
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:42,127
I apologize in advance
if it's a little loose around the balls.

901
00:48:43,505 --> 00:48:45,881
Okay. What do we got, tough guy? Come on.

902
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:49,218
[Shaw] I've created new identities
and altered your biometric profiles

903
00:48:49,302 --> 00:48:52,179
so the airport scanners don't recognize
your faces or your fingerprints.

904
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:54,765
You're Sarah Atkins.
You work in insurance.

905
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:55,891
Hello.

906
00:48:58,895 --> 00:49:00,979
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

907
00:49:01,064 --> 00:49:02,606
[Shaw] I'm Franz Gruber.

908
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:06,485
I'm a freelance architect,
avid mountain climber,

909
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:08,403
and a part-time ski instructor.

910
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:15,077
- Thank you.
- And you, you're Michael Oxmaul.

911
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:18,789
"Mike Oxmaul."

912
00:49:23,795 --> 00:49:24,795
I go by Michael.

913
00:49:26,756 --> 00:49:29,318
- [officer] Freeze! Stop, sir! Stop there!
- [officer 2] Stay right where you are!

914
00:49:29,342 --> 00:49:31,301
- Stay there!
- It's Mike. It's Mike Oxmaul.

915
00:49:31,386 --> 00:49:34,012
It's not small. And my name's Michael.

916
00:49:34,097 --> 00:49:36,306
They've stopped him for what, exactly?

917
00:49:36,391 --> 00:49:40,185
Whatever it is, it's gonna involve
rubber gloves and a body cavity search.

918
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:41,270
Let's go.

919
00:49:41,354 --> 00:49:44,565
[dog barking]

920
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:46,567
Hands on your head, Oxmaul.

921
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:55,427
[Hattie] Can't believe you did that.

922
00:49:55,451 --> 00:49:57,119
He was gonna slow us down.

923
00:49:59,956 --> 00:50:02,291
We can't pull this off. We both know it.

924
00:50:03,168 --> 00:50:04,687
It's bad enough
I got this thing in my blood

925
00:50:04,711 --> 00:50:06,147
that's gonna kill me and everyone else,

926
00:50:06,171 --> 00:50:08,357
but were you seriously gonna break
this mysterious machine

927
00:50:08,381 --> 00:50:10,966
out of some
high-security death virus complex

928
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,676
and magically get it to work?

929
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,560
- Frankly, that sounds completely...
- You still wear that silly thing?

930
00:50:17,307 --> 00:50:18,682
Didn't know you still had that.

931
00:50:19,851 --> 00:50:21,059
Put the pin back in.

932
00:50:22,562 --> 00:50:23,645
You haven't changed.

933
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:29,359
Wish I could say the same about you.

934
00:50:29,444 --> 00:50:31,403
Hey, you're gonna be okay.

935
00:50:32,447 --> 00:50:35,073
We're gonna make this work.
It's what we do.

936
00:50:36,326 --> 00:50:37,492
And what if we don't?

937
00:50:40,038 --> 00:50:42,558
- What if the only option is for you to...
- It's not happening.

938
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:46,585
Hi, I'm here. I'm Michael.

939
00:50:50,882 --> 00:50:52,049
Hi, yeah.

940
00:50:52,717 --> 00:50:54,551
Hello. All right.

941
00:50:56,137 --> 00:51:00,349
Oh, yeah, let's see. Where's my seat?

942
00:51:00,433 --> 00:51:02,809
F-one, F-two...

943
00:51:04,103 --> 00:51:05,103
F you.

944
00:51:07,899 --> 00:51:08,941
Hey.

945
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:14,780
You are an asshole.

946
00:51:15,323 --> 00:51:16,592
You were quicker than I thought.

947
00:51:16,616 --> 00:51:18,408
Yup. Because I have
a secret weapon.

948
00:51:18,493 --> 00:51:20,077
People actually like me.

949
00:51:20,787 --> 00:51:23,307
You wouldn't understand that
because you don't have any friends.

950
00:51:28,461 --> 00:51:29,711
I love your babushka.

951
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:39,263

953
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:08,602
Couldn't have booked an emergency row
for a little bit more legroom?

954
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:11,420
Not everybody has hobbit legs like you.

955
00:52:11,504 --> 00:52:16,216
Hey, look, in case you didn't realize,
I couldn't give a damn about your comfort.

956
00:52:16,301 --> 00:52:18,218
So why don't you be a good elephant,

957
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:22,097
suck up another kilo of peanuts,
put your chair back and relax?

958
00:52:22,557 --> 00:52:25,157
Listen, don't ever tell me to relax.
Don't tell me to do anything.

959
00:52:25,184 --> 00:52:26,601
Any time you ever say anything,

960
00:52:26,686 --> 00:52:29,246
it makes me want to take my boot
and shove it so far up your ass,

961
00:52:29,272 --> 00:52:31,041
you're gonna be
spitting out shoelaces all week.

962
00:52:31,065 --> 00:52:33,066
Hey, you know what the problem is?

963
00:52:33,776 --> 00:52:36,069
I'll tell you the problem. This job.

964
00:52:36,154 --> 00:52:37,904
This job requires stealth.

965
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:41,450
And you... look at you.

966
00:52:41,534 --> 00:52:45,954
I mean, granted, it's not your fault.
But you're too obvious.

967
00:52:46,039 --> 00:52:50,250
You stick out. Like balls on a bulldog.

968
00:52:50,335 --> 00:52:53,003
Dangling down in all the wrong places.

969
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:54,671
Seemingly harmless.

970
00:52:57,050 --> 00:52:59,843
And the next thing you know,
they're trying to impregnate your sister.

971
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:01,511
[chuckles] What?

972
00:53:02,764 --> 00:53:04,806
- Impregnate your sister?
- You heard.

973
00:53:06,017 --> 00:53:07,351
Oh...

974
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:10,020
Now I get it.

975
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:14,024
You do? Good. I'm glad. Yeah, I'm glad.

976
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:15,748
- I'm very glad.
- You actually think that

977
00:53:15,777 --> 00:53:18,236
I'm going through all this effort,
on this mission,

978
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:21,448
trying to save the world,
by the way, for a fourth time,

979
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,075
because I'm really good at it.

980
00:53:23,159 --> 00:53:26,411
You think I'm going through all of this
just so I can do the horizontal-hula,

981
00:53:26,496 --> 00:53:28,497
sexy, sexy time with your sister?

982
00:53:28,581 --> 00:53:30,874
Not all. Most.

983
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:34,795
Let me break it down for you, Frodo.
This ain't 1955 anymore, all right?

984
00:53:34,879 --> 00:53:38,006
Despite the fact that that girl sleeping
right there is related to you,

985
00:53:38,091 --> 00:53:41,051
she's still one of the toughest,
baddest, most capable women

986
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:43,220
I've ever encountered in my entire life.

987
00:53:43,304 --> 00:53:46,598
And if she chooses to look the way

988
00:53:46,682 --> 00:53:49,476
of this big, brown,

989
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:55,524
well-endowed, tattooed
mountain of a man, then guess what.

990
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:58,318
I'm gonna let her climb this mountain

991
00:53:58,403 --> 00:54:03,115
over and over and over again.

992
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:04,783
You stay away from her.

993
00:54:05,368 --> 00:54:08,453
I see what you're doing.
You think I'm stupid?

994
00:54:08,538 --> 00:54:10,974
Of course I think you're stupid.
But you know what? I'll do you a favor.

995
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:13,644
I'll knock that dumb right out of
your skull. You just say the word, jack.

996
00:54:13,668 --> 00:54:14,668
You know what I wanna do?

997
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:19,339
I wanna do an Irish jig
on your arse-ugly face at 30,000 feet.

998
00:54:19,424 --> 00:54:20,799
- Oh, 30,000 feet.
- Yeah.

999
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:22,361
- So you wanna dance right now?
- Yeah.

1000
00:54:22,385 --> 00:54:24,678
The only thing holding you back
is air and opportunity.

1001
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:26,930
[inhales deeply] And there goes the air.

1002
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:28,557
- Bring it on, Don Ho.
- "Don Ho"?

1003
00:54:28,641 --> 00:54:30,851
That's enough! Hey, cut it out.

1004
00:54:30,935 --> 00:54:32,102
Both of y'all, cut it out.

1005
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:34,312
Oh, see? You woke up the air marshal.

1006
00:54:34,397 --> 00:54:35,689
You woke the air marshal.

1007
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:37,793
- How'd you know I was the air marshal?
- Unaccompanied.

1008
00:54:37,817 --> 00:54:39,693
- Late boarding the plane.
- Aisle seat.

1009
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:41,194
- Golf shirt.
- Golf shirt.

1010
00:54:43,239 --> 00:54:45,365
Let's just call that an educated guess.

1011
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:47,951
Air Marshal Dinkley, at your service.

1012
00:54:48,035 --> 00:54:50,120
I'm sorry, did you just say "Dinkley"?

1013
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:52,456
What's the problem? Dinkley.

1014
00:54:53,082 --> 00:54:56,084
I understand this big fella,
because it's my job to observe.

1015
00:54:56,169 --> 00:54:59,504
Thick neck, your head's been on a swivel
since you've been on this damn plane.

1016
00:54:59,589 --> 00:55:02,299
Every passenger that's got on here
you been checking out.

1017
00:55:02,383 --> 00:55:03,508
You're a lawman.

1018
00:55:03,593 --> 00:55:06,219
And you, Mr. Armani pants, you're a spy.

1019
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:08,930
- He's pretty good.
- Not bad.

1020
00:55:09,015 --> 00:55:10,640
I get it. We're all big guys.

What you throwing up on the bench?
Three, four hundred pounds?

1025
00:55:20,026 --> 00:55:22,277
- Little less.
- Yeah, light work.

1026
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:25,113
I'm doing the same thing. Slagging weight.

1027

1036
00:55:45,551 --> 00:55:47,677
- What?
- I was a compartmented element for JSOC.

1037
00:55:47,762 --> 00:55:48,762
You were in Delta?

1038

1039
00:55:51,057 --> 00:55:54,100
"Echo"? Those guys were the warlocks
because of the magic they could do.

- If that's the case,

Your balance is off.

1044

really not worth that much.

1107

We need to find the C-17 viral
extraction machine. Could be anywhere.

1108
00:59:31,944 --> 00:59:34,404
That facility is
three square miles of research labs.

Yeah. And it's a powder keg
packed with munitions.

When Deck and I were kids,
we'd spend our time coming up with grifts.

1114
00:59:46,876 --> 00:59:49,961
A "Mick Jagger" was a job
that required one person to showboat

to draw all the eyes
while the others made the music.

01:04:28,866 --> 01:04:31,367
Looks like she's 400 yards through there.

1190
01:04:31,452 --> 01:04:33,430
Looks like they're holding her
in some sort of medical pod.

1191
01:04:33,454 --> 01:04:36,122
Timer's set for 45 minutes.
We get in and get out.

1192
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:39,125
Blow this death factory to pieces.
Remember the hallway.

1193
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:41,961
- No guns.
- Right. Those guys have to be alive.

1194
01:04:42,046 --> 01:04:43,189
Because at the end of the hallway,

1195
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:45,213
the retinal scanner needs a match
to open the door.

1196
01:04:45,674 --> 01:04:47,341
- Pick a door.
- I'm right there.

1197
01:04:47,426 --> 01:04:48,593
Nope, that's my door.

1198
01:04:48,677 --> 01:04:49,802
What's the matter with you?

1199
01:04:53,057 --> 01:04:55,308
[beeping]

1200
01:04:55,392 --> 01:04:57,685
I made a mistake. This is your door.

1201
01:04:57,770 --> 01:05:00,229
Oh, no. No backsies. What's the matter?

1202
01:05:00,314 --> 01:05:01,958
You got a lot of bad guys
behind that door?

1203
01:05:01,982 --> 01:05:04,108
Watch this. You might learn something.

1204
01:05:14,745 --> 01:05:16,037
[all shouting]

1205
01:05:16,121 --> 01:05:18,039
[grunting]

1206
01:05:28,342 --> 01:05:29,675
[growls]

1207
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,140
[groaning]

1208
01:05:39,478 --> 01:05:41,270
[mouthing] Watch this.

1209
01:05:41,647 --> 01:05:42,647
[laughs]

1210
01:05:47,236 --> 01:05:48,236
[guard shouts]

1211
01:05:50,739 --> 01:05:53,032
[grunting]

1212
01:05:57,162 --> 01:05:58,454
[yawns]

1213
01:06:06,046 --> 01:06:07,088
Eh.

1214
01:06:07,172 --> 01:06:08,923
[guard grunts]

1215
01:06:25,065 --> 01:06:32,572
[electricity crackles]

1216
01:06:38,036 --> 01:06:39,036
[beeps]

1217
01:06:39,121 --> 01:06:40,682

[whispers] You come and do it!

01:07:17,326 --> 01:07:19,118
- [chimes]
- Access granted.

1224
01:07:21,413 --> 01:07:22,580
Doors opening.

1225
01:07:30,756 --> 01:07:33,090
Very good. Well done, boys.

1226
01:07:34,176 --> 01:07:35,968
I'm impressed that you even got in here.

1227
01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:37,678
[both groan]

1228
01:07:54,363 --> 01:07:56,989
[in Russian]

1229
01:08:10,128 --> 01:08:11,504
[guards scream]

1230
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:17,760
[both groan]

1231
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:23,516
That... That's... That's not possible.

1232
01:08:27,938 --> 01:08:30,940
- No. What are you doing?
- Having to extract it myself.

1233
01:08:34,444 --> 01:08:35,444
Wait!

1234
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:47,790
[engine rumbling]

1235
01:08:49,584 --> 01:08:50,918
- [chains clink]
- [grunts]

1236
01:08:51,003 --> 01:08:52,878
[panting]

1237
01:08:59,052 --> 01:09:02,013
There he is. Nice and rested?

1238
01:09:02,764 --> 01:09:05,850
Get your full eight hours?
I was gonna order some room service.

1239
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:09,562
What do you fancy?
French toast? I'll get the order in.

1240
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:11,772
I just dreamt they killed you
before I woke up.

1241
01:09:12,816 --> 01:09:14,275
Pretty disappointed right now.

1242
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:17,278
It's a little elaborate, I must admit.

1243
01:09:17,362 --> 01:09:20,740
Old-school interrogation technique
we picked up in black ops.

1244
01:09:20,824 --> 01:09:23,451
Shock will kill a man in three.
Do you remember that, Deck?

1245
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:26,203
Yeah, I remember
a lot of things from back then.

1246
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:28,873
I reckon you've only got
four shocks in you, boys.

1247
01:09:28,957 --> 01:09:30,624
Yeah? I think we could take five.

1248
01:09:30,709 --> 01:09:33,044
"Five"? Well, all right.

1249
01:09:33,128 --> 01:09:35,671
- [electricity buzzing]
- [Hobbs, Shaw straining]

1250
01:09:40,052 --> 01:09:43,387
- [buzzing stops]
- [both panting]

1251
01:09:44,473 --> 01:09:46,557
You had to open your big mouth, didn't ya?

1252
01:09:47,309 --> 01:09:49,352
I thought it was a cool thing
to say in the moment.

1253
01:09:58,445 --> 01:10:00,363
[grunting]

1254
01:10:07,329 --> 01:10:09,205
Do you remember
when we were real brothers?

1255
01:10:09,289 --> 01:10:11,916
Task Force Black.
Do you remember that, Deck?

1256
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,293
Man, we ended up
seeing the worst in people.

1257
01:10:14,378 --> 01:10:19,048
Worst in our countries, our leaders,
our enemies, our friends.

1258
01:10:19,132 --> 01:10:20,943
You don't know
the meaning of that word anymore.

1259
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:22,927
But don't worry about it, neither does he.

1260
01:10:23,011 --> 01:10:24,155
He shoots them right in the head,

1261
01:10:24,179 --> 01:10:25,948
but in your case,
I thought it was a hell of a good idea.

1262
01:10:25,972 --> 01:10:27,515
Big man, you still talking?

1263
01:10:27,599 --> 01:10:29,392
I said I thought it was a hell of a good...

1264
01:10:29,476 --> 01:10:31,268
[electricity buzzing]

1265
01:10:31,353 --> 01:10:35,231
[both grunting]

1266
01:10:37,943 --> 01:10:39,068
Shit.

1267
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:42,822
[laughs] You know, it's funny
how humanity's hate for each other

1268
01:10:42,906 --> 01:10:44,865
is stronger
than its own self-preservation,

1269
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:46,242
which is why we're here.

1270
01:10:46,326 --> 01:10:49,829
Remember eight years ago, Deck,
when Eteon asked us to join their mission?

1271
01:10:49,913 --> 01:10:51,747
Oh, you mean their death cult.

1272
01:10:52,332 --> 01:10:54,458
- They're lunatics.
- Visionaries.

1273
01:10:54,543 --> 01:10:58,212
Visionaries of a future.
A bigger future. A brighter future.

1274
01:10:58,296 --> 01:11:00,256
You remember the data they gave us, man.

1275
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:04,593
What with environmental damage,
capitalism, terrorism,

1276
01:11:04,678 --> 01:11:07,388
humanity wipes itself out by 2096.

1277
01:11:07,472 --> 01:11:08,973
Now, that is scary to me.

1278
01:11:09,057 --> 01:11:11,517
But if we fulfill Eteon's vision,

1279
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:14,311
- you save their world.
- You don't save the world with genocide.

1280
01:11:14,396 --> 01:11:16,188
Genocide, schmenocide.

1281
01:11:16,857 --> 01:11:18,315
You know what this virus is?

1282
01:11:19,067 --> 01:11:21,610
This virus is a necessary
shock to the system.

1283
01:11:21,695 --> 01:11:23,028
- [electricity buzzing]
- [grunts]

1284
01:11:24,406 --> 01:11:26,031
[Shaw shouts in distance]

1285
01:11:27,451 --> 01:11:33,205
- [electricity buzzing]
- [strained grunting]

1286
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:35,541
- [electricity stops]
- [both panting]

1287
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:37,501
Whoo! That's three.

1288
01:11:38,128 --> 01:11:40,087
[chuckles] I love this thing.

1289
01:11:40,172 --> 01:11:44,800
Told you then, I'm telling you now,
your metrics are off.

1290
01:11:45,302 --> 01:11:48,429
One good reason:
You assume the worst in people.

1291
01:11:48,513 --> 01:11:51,932
People cannot be trusted to do
the right thing. Look at the two of you.

1292
01:11:52,017 --> 01:11:54,737
The fate of the world is in your hands,
and you can't even get along.

1293
01:11:55,353 --> 01:11:58,022
But you know all about doing
the right thing, don't you, Shaw?

1294
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:04,445
Little souvenir, huh, bro?

1295
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:09,909
You come to kill me,
I'll do the same every time.

1296
01:12:10,994 --> 01:12:12,244
What'd you expect? A shiatsu?

1297
01:12:13,914 --> 01:12:15,206
[laughs]

1298
01:12:15,624 --> 01:12:16,624
Anyone talking to you?

1299
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:18,792
Your mama.

1300
01:12:18,877 --> 01:12:22,171
- [electricity buzzing]
- [both grunting]

1301
01:12:24,508 --> 01:12:26,467
- Yeah!
- [both grunt]

1302
01:12:27,093 --> 01:12:30,471
[laughs] I get it. You're still mad.

1303
01:12:30,555 --> 01:12:34,475
You're upset because,
hey, when you wouldn't turn,

1304
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:36,746
they asked me to come and kill you,
and, of course, I had to

1305
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:38,187
because you knew too much.

1306
01:12:39,147 --> 01:12:42,191
But I think about that night a lot.
I think about it.

1307
01:12:42,275 --> 01:12:45,236
Because what I realize now
that I did not realize then

1308
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:48,239
is that when you shot me,
you gave me a gift.

1309
01:12:48,323 --> 01:12:51,283
Look at me. I'm black Superman.

1310
01:12:51,952 --> 01:12:54,036
Bulletproof, new spine,

1311
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:57,915
and the more machine I become,
the more humane I am.

1312
01:12:57,999 --> 01:12:59,917
This is what you wanna fight for.

1313
01:13:00,502 --> 01:13:03,379
I'm giving you another
chance to join us, Deckard.

1314
01:13:03,463 --> 01:13:05,673
And the boss wants big mouth as well.

1315
01:13:05,757 --> 01:13:07,091
If not, I kill you both.

1316
01:13:07,759 --> 01:13:10,052
Which, honestly, I'd love to do.

1317
01:13:11,805 --> 01:13:14,598
You know Eteon.
You know what they're capable of.

1318
01:13:14,683 --> 01:13:17,726
They rebuilt me. Dismantled him.

1319
01:13:17,811 --> 01:13:22,898
Made it look he killed his own team.
Even your own sister... disowned you.

1320
01:13:22,983 --> 01:13:23,983
[sighs]

1321
01:13:26,444 --> 01:13:29,947
Just say the word, bro.
Say the word and all of this goes away.

1322
01:13:30,448 --> 01:13:32,825
Your sister lives. His daughter lives.

1323
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:36,579
We get you some upgrades,
and we go on to saving the world.

1324
01:13:36,663 --> 01:13:38,122
[chuckles]

1325
01:13:38,582 --> 01:13:39,665
What's it to be?

1326
01:13:39,749 --> 01:13:42,710
Join the evolution of man,
or die with the weak?

1327
01:13:44,963 --> 01:13:46,255
Just get it done.

1328
01:13:47,465 --> 01:13:50,843
I told the boss you wouldn't
change your mind.

1329
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:52,386
See you later.

1330
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:54,305
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait!

1331
01:13:54,764 --> 01:13:56,557
[panting]

1332
01:13:56,641 --> 01:13:58,183
I think we should join.

1333
01:13:58,268 --> 01:13:59,435
Join?

1334
01:14:01,938 --> 01:14:04,023
You said some really compelling things.

1335
01:14:04,107 --> 01:14:07,067
I mean, that black Superman thing,
that really got me. I love that.

1336
01:14:07,152 --> 01:14:09,570
What are you, deaf, stupid, or both?
We ain't joining.

1337
01:14:09,654 --> 01:14:12,508
There you go again, you're just thinking
about yourself. You're such a diva.

1338
01:14:12,532 --> 01:14:14,116
What about my feelings, for once?

1339
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:17,494
Let me tell you something,
if we were a band, you know who you'd be?

1340
01:14:17,579 --> 01:14:18,787
You'd be Mick Jagger.

1341
01:14:18,872 --> 01:14:20,080
"Mick Jagger"?

1342
01:14:21,583 --> 01:14:22,583
Mick Jagger.

1343
01:14:23,418 --> 01:14:25,252
[Brixton] Oi, what's it to be?

1344
01:14:25,712 --> 01:14:27,004
In or out?

1345
01:14:32,177 --> 01:14:33,738
- We're not gonna join.
- We're not gonna join.

1346
01:14:33,762 --> 01:14:36,305
But since you're standing there,
here's what I'm gonna do.

1347
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:39,933
I'm gonna rip the arm off this chair.
I'm gonna smash him right in the face.

1348
01:14:40,018 --> 01:14:41,935
Stab him right in the neck
for looking that way.

1349
01:14:42,020 --> 01:14:44,146
Kill all 13 guys in seven seconds.

1350
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:45,606
And here's what I'm gonna do.

1351
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:47,900
I'm gonna slip out of these chains
and dropkick him,

1352
01:14:47,984 --> 01:14:50,861
him and him right in the throat.

1353
01:14:50,945 --> 01:14:53,947
No, not him, that's my guy.
You gotta pick another guy.

1354
01:14:54,032 --> 01:14:55,801
What do you mean that's your guy?
That's my guy.

1355
01:14:55,825 --> 01:14:58,869
No, no. That's face-smash guy.
You gotta find another dropkick guy.

1356

01:28:15,416 --> 01:28:18,042
You should've stayed away.
What did you bring here?

1528
01:28:18,127 --> 01:28:19,688
- I brought the truth here.
- What truth?

1529
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:20,879
The truth is we were set up.

1530
01:28:20,963 --> 01:28:23,131
We were framed by people
who created a deadly virus.

1531
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:25,967
- Oh, come on.
- It could go global if it's not stopped.

1532
01:28:26,051 --> 01:28:27,760
We could all die. All of us.

1533
01:28:27,845 --> 01:28:29,925
Everybody here in this fale,
everybody on the island.

1534
01:28:29,972 --> 01:28:31,347
And everybody around the world.

1535
01:28:31,432 --> 01:28:33,475
Jonah, I need you
to help fix this machine.

1536
01:28:33,559 --> 01:28:34,893
I need you to help my friends,

1537
01:28:34,977 --> 01:28:37,437
and I need us
to build defenses around here, now!

1538
01:28:37,521 --> 01:28:40,081
You think you can just come back in here
and we're gonna help you

1539
01:28:40,107 --> 01:28:41,441
- after everything you did?
- Yes!

1540
01:28:41,525 --> 01:28:42,961
- Not gonna happen!
- It's bigger than you and I!

1541
01:28:42,985 --> 01:28:45,297
- I don't care!
- It's bigger than you and I! We could die.

1542
01:28:45,321 --> 01:28:48,907
Good, because I would rather die
than help you, polo head!

1543
01:28:48,991 --> 01:28:52,744
Listen, I know your brother's
hard to be around, believe me.

1544
01:28:52,828 --> 01:28:54,662
But I trust him, and he brought us here

1545
01:28:54,747 --> 01:28:59,125
because this place has something
that nowhere else on the planet does: you.

1546
01:28:59,210 --> 01:29:01,586
You don't know me! I don't know you, okay?

1547
01:29:01,670 --> 01:29:04,714
Time for you all to go.
Take your machine with you. Go, now!

1548
01:29:04,798 --> 01:29:07,383
- Go!
- Jonah Hobbs! [speaking Samoan]

If he needs anything,
we gonna give it to him.

I'm gonna take this here slipper

You boys hear me?

1557
01:29:35,371 --> 01:29:37,330
I'm sorry to bring this here, Mama.

You can have your revenge.

1567

I will.

1568
01:30:22,084 --> 01:30:24,544
We found 'em.
They hopped an unregistered cargo plane.

1569
01:30:24,628 --> 01:30:26,421

- Samoa.

Your dad was a car thief, then?

1584

No. My dad actually stole everything.

Sounds just like my family.

1587
01:31:11,842 --> 01:31:13,760
[Hobbs]
Mama raised us till we were teenagers,

1588
01:31:13,844 --> 01:31:16,179
and my old man
started coming around again.

1589
01:31:16,263 --> 01:31:18,431
Taking a real interest in his sons.

1590
01:31:18,515 --> 01:31:20,933
The truth is,
he was just looking for a new crew.

1591
01:31:21,935 --> 01:31:24,228
And I was the only one
to see through those lies.

1592
01:31:28,025 --> 01:31:31,361
So the jobs my dad pulled
me and my brothers into

1593
01:31:31,445 --> 01:31:34,030
just got bigger and more dangerous.

1594
01:31:35,449 --> 01:31:36,532
Then eventually he knew,

1595
01:31:36,617 --> 01:31:40,495
and he was okay with,
getting me and my brothers killed.

1596
01:31:42,581 --> 01:31:43,915
So I turned him in.

1597
01:31:43,999 --> 01:31:46,042
Or you protected your family.

1598
01:31:49,713 --> 01:31:53,883

1621
01:33:13,797 --> 01:33:15,548
That is an understatement.

1622

1627
01:33:32,733 --> 01:33:34,859
Got it. We're gonna need a lot more.

1628
01:33:34,943 --> 01:33:36,861
We're never gonna survive their firepower.

1629
01:33:36,945 --> 01:33:39,447
It doesn't take a man to pull a trigger,

1630
01:33:39,531 --> 01:33:41,342
but for Eteon,
it does take an activation chip.

01:33:55,088 --> 01:33:56,506
War is what I do.

1639
01:33:57,758 --> 01:33:59,383
Let's go old-school.

1640
01:34:00,594 --> 01:34:01,886
[Hobbs] Take a look around.

1641
01:34:02,763 --> 01:34:04,388
This is where we draw the line.

1642
01:34:04,973 --> 01:34:07,433
Who would've thought this is where
we're gonna save the world?

1643
01:34:07,976 --> 01:34:10,102
We need to make 'em play by our rules.

1644
01:34:10,187 --> 01:34:12,980
Tomorrow morning there'll be a storm
raging on the north cliffs.

1645
01:34:13,065 --> 01:34:14,774
We'll build a no-man's-land there.

1646
01:34:14,858 --> 01:34:18,194
And if all else fails,
that'll be our last stand.

1647
01:34:19,112 --> 01:34:21,155
How many more of these we gotta do?

1648
01:34:22,866 --> 01:34:24,158

When we were in Kandahar running raids,

1650
01:34:27,079 --> 01:34:29,664
Brixton would always strike
just before dawn.

1651
01:34:29,748 --> 01:34:33,042
It's when the enemy's most tired,
still under the cover of night.

you got the sun at your back.

- Give me the good news, Hat.
- I'm in.

1699
01:36:30,827 --> 01:36:33,598
The only thing is, I could only block
the signal repeaters on the satellite

1700
01:36:33,622 --> 01:36:34,705
for six minutes.

1701
01:36:34,790 --> 01:36:39,168
Six minutes might be all the time we need.
Better than a sharp stick in the eye.

1702
01:36:39,252 --> 01:36:42,088
Which is basically
all we've got to fight them with anyway.

1703
01:36:42,172 --> 01:36:43,881
Done more with less, haven't we?

1704
01:36:43,966 --> 01:36:45,091
[chuckles]

1705
01:37:01,775 --> 01:37:02,775
[Hobbs] Hi.

1706
01:37:04,861 --> 01:37:07,822
- Drink?
- Sure. Thank you.

1707
01:37:10,993 --> 01:37:11,993
[bottles clink]

1708
01:37:12,077 --> 01:37:15,204
Just taking it all in,
in case it's the last sunset we see.

1709
01:37:22,379 --> 01:37:24,797
I shouldn't have believed
that Deckard went dark.

1710
01:37:30,387 --> 01:37:34,390
Wasted so much time. I'm...

1711
01:37:39,646 --> 01:37:43,315
I've spent my whole life running away.

1712
01:37:44,109 --> 01:37:46,402
- Me too.
- Yeah?

1713
01:37:47,988 --> 01:37:48,988
Yeah.

1714
01:37:51,366 --> 01:37:52,846
I haven't been back here in 25 years.

1715
01:37:52,909 --> 01:37:55,536
I mean, my own daughter
doesn't even know her family.

1716
01:37:57,414 --> 01:38:01,083
Well... you can change that.

1717
01:38:06,006 --> 01:38:07,006
Yeah.

1718
01:38:08,175 --> 01:38:09,341
So can you.

1719
01:38:10,802 --> 01:38:14,388
I got an idea. Why don't you and I
make a promise right here, right now?

1720
01:38:14,473 --> 01:38:19,518
That when we see tomorrow's sunset,
we begin to fix the mistakes we've made.

1721
01:38:30,155 --> 01:38:32,740
That's just sealed it
so you can't back out. That's all.

1722
01:38:36,787 --> 01:38:39,663
I don't think there's any chance in hell
I would back out.

1723
01:38:40,791 --> 01:38:42,500
You wanna seal it again or...

1724
01:38:42,584 --> 01:38:44,224
- [Hattie] Definitely not.
- [Hobbs] Okay.

1725
01:38:44,669 --> 01:38:46,295
[Hattie] Maybe tomorrow, if I survive.

1726
01:38:49,257 --> 01:38:50,818
- [Hobbs] Jonah.
- [Jonah] Look, don't rush me.

1727
01:38:50,842 --> 01:38:53,385
[Hobbs]
It's almost dawn. He'll be here soon.

1728
01:38:53,470 --> 01:38:55,510
- Make it happen now! Now!
- [Jonah speaking Samoan]

1729
01:38:55,555 --> 01:38:57,807
Hey, don't rush me.
That's how mistakes are made.

1730
01:38:57,891 --> 01:38:59,850
And how long does this process take?

1731
01:38:59,935 --> 01:39:02,103
It's 30 minutes and 33 till I go viral.

1732
01:39:02,187 --> 01:39:04,605
Deck, I think we need to
seriously consider option one.

1733
01:39:04,689 --> 01:39:06,524
Don't strike a match just yet, Hats.

1734
01:39:06,608 --> 01:39:08,359
We are seriously gonna miss this window.

1735
01:39:08,443 --> 01:39:10,653
- Let's do this. Come on!
- Jonah, now!

1736
01:39:10,737 --> 01:39:13,948
Fine, fine, okay. Here goes nothing.

1737
01:39:14,658 --> 01:39:16,534
- [beeps]
- Brace yourself, Hats.

1738
01:39:17,786 --> 01:39:20,788
- It ain't gonna be pleasant.
- No, it's gonna be fine. [groans]

01:39:24,167 --> 01:39:31,841

01:39:35,762 --> 01:39:37,429
It's working. It's working.

1742
01:39:37,514 --> 01:39:39,181
- Yeah.
- [cheering]

1743
01:39:39,266 --> 01:39:40,516
[Jonah] Yeah!

1744
01:39:45,397 --> 01:39:47,022
[man] Hey. They triggered the alarm!

1745
01:39:47,566 --> 01:39:48,566
That's him.

1746
01:39:49,317 --> 01:39:51,610
- As we planned?
- As we planned.

1747
01:39:52,112 --> 01:39:53,362
Usos!

1748
01:39:55,866 --> 01:39:56,866
It's time.

1749
01:40:00,996 --> 01:40:02,204
Jonah.

1750
01:40:07,127 --> 01:40:08,586
Just wanna say that...

1751
01:40:10,005 --> 01:40:11,630
if this thing goes sideways and...

1752
01:40:13,216 --> 01:40:14,341
and this is it...

1753
01:40:17,762 --> 01:40:18,762
I'm sorry.

1754
01:40:21,183 --> 01:40:23,517
I may have had my reasons,
but the fact is...

1755
01:40:26,605 --> 01:40:29,064
I left you and I left our 'aiga.

1756
01:40:33,904 --> 01:40:35,237
I should've come home.

1757
01:40:36,573 --> 01:40:38,407
If we make it through this,

1758
01:40:38,491 --> 01:40:40,743
you have my word
I'll never let that happen again.

1759
01:40:44,623 --> 01:40:45,623
I love you, uso.

1760
01:40:54,174 --> 01:40:55,299
I love you too, uso.

1761
01:41:02,807 --> 01:41:05,267
[Shaw] Okay, you're mobile.

1762
01:41:08,772 --> 01:41:10,666
Do you think I need to be so close
to the front line?

1763
01:41:10,690 --> 01:41:12,733
Yeah, we keep you close.
Keep an eye on you

1764
01:41:12,817 --> 01:41:14,568
in case we need to make a quick getaway.

1765
01:41:14,653 --> 01:41:16,403
Hey, this is what we do, right?

1766
01:41:17,822 --> 01:41:19,406
It is what we do.

1767
01:41:21,451 --> 01:41:22,576
Deck...

1768
01:41:26,665 --> 01:41:28,499
I overheard what Brixton said.

1769
01:41:31,044 --> 01:41:33,003
That you stayed away to protect us.

1770
01:41:35,548 --> 01:41:38,384
I never should've believed all that stuff,
I know it now.

1771
01:41:40,512 --> 01:41:43,305
- I don't know why I did. I'm so sorry.
- Don't be.

1772
01:41:44,557 --> 01:41:49,770
Don't be. Hey, look, I've done things,
done things I'm not proud of.

1773
01:41:51,022 --> 01:41:54,650
Things I... have to make amends for.

1774
01:41:54,734 --> 01:41:57,278
All thanks to what that bastard
put me through.

1775
01:41:58,488 --> 01:42:01,323
But right now,
the most important thing to me

1776
01:42:01,408 --> 01:42:03,325
is getting my little sister home safely.

1867
01:53:00,441 --> 01:53:02,567
- The rotor!
- Losing power.

1868
01:53:05,071 --> 01:53:06,905
- [grunts]
- Guys!

1869
01:53:06,989 --> 01:53:08,573
Hattie! Jump!

1870
01:53:11,702 --> 01:53:13,370
[shouts]

1871
01:53:21,921 --> 01:53:23,213
[Hobbs shouts]

1872
01:53:29,762 --> 01:53:30,845
[thunder rumbling]

1873
01:53:33,891 --> 01:53:35,058
[thunder crashes]

1874
01:53:35,142 --> 01:53:37,936
- [electrical buzzing]
- [grunting, panting]

1875
01:53:44,902 --> 01:53:47,278
[groaning]

1876
01:53:53,995 --> 01:53:55,328
[grunts]

1877
01:53:56,163 --> 01:53:57,831
[rapid beeping]

1878
01:54:00,793 --> 01:54:02,877
Hey, get up. Get up!

1879
01:54:03,504 --> 01:54:04,921
Hey! Get up!

1880
01:54:05,381 --> 01:54:07,632
You don't die until I tell you to die.

1881
01:54:07,717 --> 01:54:09,217
You see the extraction timer?

1882
01:54:09,301 --> 01:54:13,430
When it hits zero, empty this clip
into her heart, do you understand?

1883
01:54:14,181 --> 01:54:15,765
[grunting]

1884
01:54:15,850 --> 01:54:18,393
[thunder rumbling]

1885
01:54:24,191 --> 01:54:25,191
Hattie!

1886
01:54:25,985 --> 01:54:27,318
[coughing]

1887
01:54:28,946 --> 01:54:30,947
[Brixton] This doesn't end your way, boys.

1888
01:54:31,032 --> 01:54:32,991
Yeah, you keep telling yourself that.

1889
01:54:33,075 --> 01:54:35,910
The numbers don't add up for you.

1890
01:54:36,412 --> 01:54:39,497
The evolution of man is coming,
whether you like it or not.

1891
01:54:42,460 --> 01:54:44,627
[Shaw]
You know, I almost feel bad for you.

1892
01:54:44,712 --> 01:54:47,047
'Cause it's not just metal
they filled your head with.

1893
01:54:47,131 --> 01:54:48,673
It's bullshit.

1894
01:54:51,010 --> 01:54:53,344
I was beginning to like you two,
you know that?

1895
01:54:54,972 --> 01:54:56,306
Oh, well.

1896
01:55:10,613 --> 01:55:12,113
[shouts]

1897
01:55:13,657 --> 01:55:14,949

[groaning, panting]

1899
01:55:28,172 --> 01:55:30,006
[groaning]

1900
01:55:31,884 --> 01:55:34,177
What's the problem, boys? Does it hurt?

1901
01:55:35,221 --> 01:55:38,932
Must be hard being so... human.

1902
01:55:56,283 --> 01:55:57,867
[shouts]

1903
01:56:06,210 --> 01:56:08,461
[grunts, groans]

1904
01:56:09,588 --> 01:56:10,797
- Did you see that?
- Yeah.

1905
01:56:10,881 --> 01:56:13,508
- We work together, we can hurt him.
- You're right.

1906
01:56:14,176 --> 01:56:16,719
- Time to work as a team.
- There's two of us and one of him.

1907
01:56:16,804 --> 01:56:20,014
- I'll take a punch and let you land one.
- I'll do the same.

1908
01:56:21,267 --> 01:56:22,350
I got your back, brother.

1909
01:56:22,434 --> 01:56:23,852
And I got yours.

1910
01:56:24,478 --> 01:56:26,062
Let's go unplug this sumbitch.

1911
01:56:30,568 --> 01:56:32,861
[all shout]

1912
01:56:54,633 --> 01:56:56,634

01:57:43,140 --> 01:57:44,265
[Brixton groans]

1922
01:57:50,898 --> 01:57:52,857
[rapid beeping]

1923
01:57:59,615 --> 01:58:02,075
[grunting, groaning]

1924
01:58:03,452 --> 01:58:05,119
- [gunshots]
- [both straining]

1925
01:58:18,759 --> 01:58:20,301
Here comes the kryptonite.

1926
01:58:26,141 --> 01:58:27,141
[beeping]

1927
01:58:27,226 --> 01:58:29,227
[groaning]

1928
01:58:36,026 --> 01:58:37,026
I got it.

1929
01:58:37,695 --> 01:58:38,820
You did it, Hat.

1930
01:58:39,280 --> 01:58:40,446
Never had a doubt.

1931
01:58:42,157 --> 01:58:43,700
[Hobbs]
Let's get it into safe hands.

1932
01:58:49,957 --> 01:58:51,457
You set me up as a traitor.

1933
01:58:53,294 --> 01:58:55,586
Turned my own sister against me.

1934
01:58:56,588 --> 01:59:00,758
Forced me to kill my own brother. You.

1935
01:59:00,843 --> 01:59:03,011
And here we are again. Come on!

1936
01:59:04,763 --> 01:59:06,723
Shaw, compared to the cause...

1937
01:59:10,185 --> 01:59:12,186
one life doesn't mean anything.

1938
01:59:12,646 --> 01:59:14,326
I don't know what
happened to you, Brixton.

1939
01:59:17,693 --> 01:59:19,235
But you made me kill you once.

1940
01:59:21,780 --> 01:59:23,072
I ain't doing it again.

1941
01:59:28,454 --> 01:59:30,621
Brother, you may believe in machines...

1942
01:59:32,249 --> 01:59:33,416
but we believe in people.

1943
01:59:33,500 --> 01:59:35,835
[whooping, cheering]

1944
01:59:35,919 --> 01:59:38,796
[thunder rumbling]

1945
01:59:41,967 --> 01:59:44,135
You may have all the technology
in the world.

1946
01:59:48,349 --> 01:59:49,515
We have heart.

1947
01:59:51,435 --> 01:59:54,395
No machine will ever beat that.

1948
01:59:54,480 --> 01:59:56,314
[laughs]

1949
01:59:56,398 --> 02:00:00,485
You boys, you're gonna get
one Samoan ass-whupping.

1950
02:00:00,569 --> 02:00:02,236
[whooping, cheering]

1951
02:00:09,495 --> 02:00:12,163
[director] Shut Brixton down.

1952
02:00:20,255 --> 02:00:21,672
So that's how it is?

1953
02:00:25,761 --> 02:00:27,804
It's a hell of a business, boys.

1954
02:00:40,609 --> 02:00:43,361
[electrical whirring]

1955
02:00:45,864 --> 02:00:48,950
[director] Brixton never really lived up
to our expectations.

1956
02:00:50,035 --> 02:00:53,871
But you three,
you outperformed your analytics.

1957
02:00:55,124 --> 02:00:57,417
You don't remember me, do you, Hobbs?

1958
02:00:59,044 --> 02:01:00,044
You will.

1959
02:01:01,171 --> 02:01:02,922
It's gonna be a hell of a reunion.

1960
02:01:05,092 --> 02:01:06,801
You're on our radar now.

1961
02:01:08,220 --> 02:01:09,470
And you're on ours.

1962
02:01:11,432 --> 02:01:14,559
- [static crackles]
- [electronics power down]

1963
02:01:18,730 --> 02:01:21,334
Hey, thanks for being my sidekick
through this whole thing, brother.

1964
02:01:21,358 --> 02:01:22,692
You were great.

1965
02:01:22,776 --> 02:01:24,879
Hey, how 'bout I side-kick
that stupid look off your face?

1966
02:01:24,903 --> 02:01:26,446
Yeah? How 'bout you show me right now?

1967
02:01:26,530 --> 02:01:27,780
Okay, guys.

1968
02:01:28,449 --> 02:01:29,615
Let's go home.

1969
02:01:32,619 --> 02:01:33,870
- Yeah.
- All right.

1970
02:01:33,954 --> 02:01:35,455
[Hobbs, Shaw laugh]

1971
02:01:35,539 --> 02:01:38,916
Look, Batman had Robin.
Dr. Evil had Mini-Me. You're my Mini-Me.

1972
02:01:39,001 --> 02:01:41,419
[Shaw] Han Solo had Chewbacca.
Kermit had Miss Piggy.

1973
02:01:41,503 --> 02:01:42,856
[Hobbs] That's a low blow. Don't say that.

1974
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:44,732
Don't argue with me on my island.
You're my sidekick.

[Shaw] Brought you that cake you wanted.

1994
02:02:53,200 --> 02:02:54,450
I wouldn't eat it.

1995
02:02:57,704 --> 02:02:59,121
Let's get out of here.

1996
02:02:59,206 --> 02:03:00,748
[chuckles]

1997
02:03:06,421 --> 02:03:08,172
How long have you been working here?

1998
02:03:10,717 --> 02:03:13,427
Sam, this is your grandma.

1999
02:03:15,597 --> 02:03:19,392
[speaking Samoan]

2000
02:03:19,476 --> 02:03:23,688
[Sam sobs] I love you.

Good to have you home, uso.

2002
02:03:30,112 --> 02:03:31,737

[panting]

2006
02:04:00,601 --> 02:04:03,644
Hobbs. I hope you're sitting down,
buddy, because we got big problems.

2007
02:04:03,729 --> 02:04:06,105
God. I feel immediately better
just talking to you.

2008
02:04:06,189 --> 02:04:07,189
Is that weird?

2009
02:04:07,274 --> 02:04:10,443
Anyway, look.
The Snowflake virus, totally fine.

2010
02:04:10,527 --> 02:04:12,445
On lockdown. In a secure asset vault.

2011
02:04:12,529 --> 02:04:17,617
But what we're dealing with
right now... is another virus.

2012
02:04:17,701 --> 02:04:21,120
The last one, well, that melted
your insides, but this one...

2013
02:04:21,913 --> 02:04:24,540
melts your outsides. Literally.

2014
02:04:24,625 --> 02:04:28,210
Your skin drips off. It's like removing
a silk kimono in a hurricane.

2015
02:04:28,712 --> 02:04:33,132
It's so gross. The point is
we need to get on this, like, now.

2016
02:04:33,216 --> 02:04:35,009
I need both of you.

2017
02:04:35,093 --> 02:04:36,135
What do you say, Becky?

2018
02:04:36,219 --> 02:04:37,655
[Sam on phone] Hey, Locke. This is Sam.

2019
02:04:37,679 --> 02:04:39,513
- Sam?
- You must wanna talk to my dad.

2020
02:04:39,598 --> 02:04:41,098
Oh, my God. Sam.

2021
02:04:42,017 --> 02:04:46,646
Wow! You sound exactly like your dad.

2022
02:04:47,105 --> 02:04:50,983
It's freaking me out right now.
It's like listening to a mirror.

2023
02:04:51,693 --> 02:04:53,694
- Can you put Hobbs on?
- I'm on.

2024
02:04:53,779 --> 02:04:55,946
I know, but I need
to speak to Hobbs, sweetie.

2025
02:04:56,031 --> 02:04:57,782
I'm on. What do you want?

2026
02:04:57,866 --> 02:05:00,826
I mean, seriously, record yourself
side by... It's crazy.

2027
02:05:00,911 --> 02:05:03,829
Before you say another word,
tell me you took care of the Snowflake.

2028
02:05:03,914 --> 02:05:07,041
I got it. It's done. We're good, okay?
'Cause I care about people.

2029
02:05:07,125 --> 02:05:09,005
- I care about our family.
- You are not family.

2030
02:05:09,086 --> 02:05:12,129
I know. What we have is so much deeper.
Listen, hey, real talk...

2031
02:05:12,756 --> 02:05:14,590
Can you believe
that Game of Thrones ending?

2032
02:05:14,675 --> 02:05:15,675
I didn't see it.

2033
02:05:15,717 --> 02:05:19,261
You watched the shit out of it,
you dirty little liar.

2034
02:05:19,346 --> 02:05:21,115
What's the problem?
You said there was a problem.

2035
02:05:21,139 --> 02:05:25,685
My problem is that Jon Snow
had sex with his aunt, then killed her,

2036
02:05:25,769 --> 02:05:28,229
and nobody wants to talk about it.
That's what my problem is.

2037
02:05:28,313 --> 02:05:31,232
