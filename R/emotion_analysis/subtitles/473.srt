1
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,800
Happy Thanksgiving!

2
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,000
- Here!
- Right here!

3
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,600
Here you go, fellas!

4
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,500
Come! Come here.

5
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,400
This is the problem.

6
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,300
This is what's wrong with America.

7
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,400
It's gotten so big

8
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,600
you just can't find your way.

9
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,500
The grocery store

10
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,000
on the corner is a now a supermarket.

11
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,300
The candy store

12
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,500
is a MacDonald's.

13
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,900
And this place...

14
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,000
a super fucking discount store.

15
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,200
Where's the pride of ownership?

16
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,100
Where's the personal service?

17
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,900
See what I mean?

18
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,400
Shit...

19
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,300
What right do they have

20
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,400
of cutting out the suppliers?

21
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,500
Pushing out all the middlemen.

22
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,900
Buying direct from the manufacturer.

23
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,500
Sony this.

24
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,300
Toshiba that.

25
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,500
All them Chinks...

26
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,800
put Americans out of work.

27
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,100
<i>...plans to take place
in Quang Tri Province.</i>

28
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,400
<i>From Laos...</i>

29
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,100
That's the way it is now.

30
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,200
You're all right ?

31
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,200
You can't find the heart of anything...

32
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,800
to stick the knife.

33
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,400
Anybody here?

34
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,800
- Can I help you?
- Call an ambulance.

35
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,300
Forget it, Frank.

36
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,500
There's no one in charge.

37
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,200
Call an ambulance!

38
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,900
<i>Some say Bumpy Johnson
was a great man,</i>

39
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,100
<i>according to eulogies,
a giving man.</i>

40
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,500
<i>A man of the people.
No one chose to use</i>

41
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,000
<i>in remembrances
the word most often associated</i>

42
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,400
<i>with Ellsworth Bumpy Johnson :
Gangster,</i>

43
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,900
<i>whose passing has brought
a Who's Who of mourners</i>

44
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,400
<i>on this chilly afternoon.</i>

45
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,600
<i>The KC mob boss,
Dominic Cattano.</i>

46
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,000
<i>Harlem crime figure,
Nicky Barnes.</i>

47
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,900
<i>From the political arena,</i>

48
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,200
<i>the Governor has come down.
The Mayor of New York,</i>

49
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,300
<i>the Chief of Police and Commissioner.</i>

50
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,300
<i>Sports and entertainment luminaries.</i>

51
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,900
<i>Bumpy Johnson,
age 62 when he passed</i>

52
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,500
<i>was a folk hero among Harlem locals
for over four decades.</i>

53
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,300
<i>Regarded by some as
the Robin Hood of Harlem,</i>

54
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,800
<i>by others as a ruthless criminal.</i>

55
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,800
I would've thought that Warnfield
put out a better spread.

56
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,500
- Want some ?
- No, thanks.

57
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,800
I want chicken wings on mine.

58
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
Who is that ?

59
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,700
He didn't know what hit him.

60
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,500
I just kept poppin'
him in the face.

61
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,200
You got a light?

62
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,600
That's very good.

63
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,500
Hey, Frank !

64
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,400
Get me a light while you're at it.

65
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,200
Appreciate it.

66
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,700
Don Cattano.

67
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,700
How you doing, Rossi?

68
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,700
- Good.
- A drink, Sir?

69
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,200
Give him a scotch.

70
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,700
Come on.

71
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,600
I know you're hurting, Frank.

72
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,900
So am I.

73
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,700
I'm all right.

74
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,200
- You going to be all right?
- Yeah.

75
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,200
I'm sure Bumpy didn't tell you,
but he made me promise

76
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,200
if anything happened to him...

77
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,800
I should make sure

78
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,600
that you're want for nothing.

79
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,400
I appreciate that.

80
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,500
Half the people here
owed Bumpy money when he died.

81
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,200
They think I'll forget to collect,
but I'll get that money.

82
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,300
Well... that's the spirit.

83
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,100
Go get them.

84
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,200
<i>Mr. Roberts!</i>

85
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,300
Taking the prosecution side,

86
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,100
give us U.S. vs. Meade,

87
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,900
subject, issues,
what the determination was

88
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,000
and what it means to us today.

89
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,400
Class shall be critiquing,

90
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,800
Mr. Roberts, so pay attention.

91
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,500
<i>I hate hearing my name,
ya know ?</i>

92
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,800
Means I gotta get up
in front of the class,

93
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,800
I gotta turn around,
and I know everyone in there,

94
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,600
they know more than I do.

95
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,700
The N°1 fear of people...

96
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,800
it ain't dying.
It's public speaking.

97
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,700
I get physically ill.
Wanna throw up.

98
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,500
And you wanna do that
for a living.

99
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,700
I don't like being like that.
I want to beat it.

100
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,100
- Should I do this?
- No, he'll take it from me.

101
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,600
He knows me since high shool.

102
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,400
- High school?
- Good morning.

103
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,700
He doesn't take it, just throw it in.

104
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,000
- That's good service.
- Throw it in?

105
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,800
- What's up, Suzie?
- Hi, Jay.

106
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,700
- How you doing, baby?
- All right.

107
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,500
You, punk !

108
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,200
You bit me, asshole !

109
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,000
I swear to God, Richie.
I didn't know it was you.

110
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,100
I'd never slam a door
on your hand, knowingly.

111
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,500
You bit my fucking hand.

112
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,300
What you doing
serving subpoenas anyway?

113
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,300
- We're on loan to County.
- County?

114
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,700
- How's that working for you?
- Fuck you.

115
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,200
I'm sorry.
Consider me served.

116
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,800
Can we leave it there?

117
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,700
Assault on a police officer?

118
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,200
I don't think so.

119
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,600
For old time's sake, what can we do,
what do you want, what can I give you?

120
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,100
What do you get for assault
with a deadly weapon, Jay?

121
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,900
- 5 years minimum.
- 5 years.

122
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,100
Guys, c'mon ! No.

123
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,300
Guys, what do you want?
Who do you want?

124
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,000
- Who do you got ?
- You want...

125
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,500
Big Al's bookie, his accountant?

126
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,700
I'll give him to you.

127
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,700
Stop, stop.

128
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,200
There he is.

129
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,700
That's him. The bookie.

130
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,600
All right. Get lost.

131
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,000
- Right here?
- Right here. Get out of the car.

132
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,500
- This is nuts.
- Come on.

133
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,800
Let's go.

134
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,700
Take it easy.

135
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,800
We stay with him or the car?

136
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,100
Let's see who comes for the car.

137
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,500
Think he made us?

138
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,800
You called in a warrant, right?
So where are they?

139
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,200
I just called, man!

140
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,100
I called and walked back here,
and ten seconds has gone by.

141
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,600
We saw him with the slips, Jay.

142
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,100
You saw policy slips?
You saw grocery bags.

143
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,600
- You don't know what's in them.
- I do, and so do you.

144
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,000
Don't give me that bull.

145
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,500
What's the rush, Richie?

146
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,900
- Half an hour, the warrant'll be here.
- I got night school.

147
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,700
Guess you're gonna miss it.

148
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,200
- Fuck this. Come on!
- You sure?

149
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,900
Yeah, let's go.

150
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,500
Fuck!

151
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,400
Fuck!

152
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,900
- It's not just a couple of bucks.
- It's the same thing, in principle.

153
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,500
We're talking principles?

154
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,900
A cop who turns in
this kind of money...

155
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,200
says one thing.
He turns in cops who take money.

156
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,200
- We'll be fucking pariahs.
- We're fucked both ways.

157
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,300
Not if we keep it. Only if we don't,
then right, we're fucked,

158
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,700
but not if we keep it.

159
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,700
Goddamn it, man!

160
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,000
Did we ask for it?
Did we put a gun to someone's head

161
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,700
and say : "Give us your money"?

162
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,100
Cops... kill cops

163
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,800
they can't trust.

164
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,500
We can't turn it in, man.

165
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,600
You believe that?

166
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,500
How much is there?

167
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,800
Nine hundred
and eighty seven thousand.

168
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,500
What happened to the rest?

169
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,200
What the hell are you doing counting it
in front of everybody. Are you nuts?

170
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,600
Get it back in the bags, seal'em up,
and down it to the property room.

171
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,000
Fucking boy-scouts.

172
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,600
So nice to see you here this evening.

173
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,400
What?

174
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,300
What?

175
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,700
Detective Trupo.
Sign here.

176
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,700
You guys ready
to make a lot of fuckin money?

177
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,500
- Always.
- Hell yeah.

178
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,100
Here you go!

179
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,200
All right. Look at this.

180
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,800
- Fucking dealers.
- Here's three more boats.

181
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,000
Hey, don't lose any of that shit.

182
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,100
- I know.
- Be careful.

183
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,100
Just enough for the reagent test.

184
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,100
A little less.

185
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,500
<i>This is the French Connection dope.</i>

186
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,600
<i>Kilos of the same dope Eddie Egan
and Sonny Grasso took from us!</i>

187
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,500
<i>The cops seize it, arrest everyone,</i>

188
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,000
<i>and they start taking it out
of the evidence room,</i>

189
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,200
<i>whacking it down to nothing
and selling it back to us.</i>

190
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,000
<i>They basically
control the market with it.</i>

191
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,200
Mr. Rossi.
A surprise.

192
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,900
<i>They've been doin this for years.
They live off it.</i>

193
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,600
<i>- Our dope.
- Many thanks.</i>

194
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,000
What the fuck is happening
to the world, Frank?

195
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,900
Fuckin crooks.

196
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,600
Sad about Bumpy.

197
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,900
Things are never gonna be the same
in Harlem.

198
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,900
You walk down the street.

199
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,900
Nobody bothers you
cause Bumpy was making sure of it.

200
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,700
Here, Frankie.

201
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,000
How is it there now?

202
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,100
It's chaos.
Every gorilla for himself.

203
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,100
Who can live like that?

204
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,000
There has to be order.

205
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,200
That would've never happened
with Italians.

206
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,700
More important than
any one man's life...

207
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,600
is order.

208
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,400
Frank.

209
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,500
Come on in.
Sit down.

210
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,900
- How y'all doin?
- Good.

211
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,000
- So, you seen Nate over there?
- Yeah, all the time.

212
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,400
Nate is everywhere.

213
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,200
- He's good.
- He's still over there.

214
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,900
Got himself a club now.

215
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,500
Where, Saigon?

216
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,700
Bangkok.

217
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,700
I don't think he's ever comin home.

218
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,700
Come on.

219
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,000
On the house
for our boys in uniform.

220
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,400
Thank you, sugar,
that's very kind.

221
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,000
Thank Frank.

222
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,300
Thanks, Frank.

223
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,300
Just relax.

224
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,900
You gonna have to boot this,
shoot a couple times.

225
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,800
Cops keep cutting it.

226
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,700
Selling the shit.

227
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,700
I won't say anything
cause the price is right.

228
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,800
But that shit in Nam

229
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,400
is way...

230
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,400
way...

231
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,400
heavy...

232
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,800
Didn't you see the jar, Frank?

233
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,100
I think you walked right past it.

234
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,000
The money jar.
What I gotta do?

235
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,800
Put a fuckin sign on it?

236
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,300
What are you thinking?
You know,

237
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,800
Bumpy don't own 116th no more.

238
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,700
He don't own no real estate
in Harlem right now. I'm the landlord,

239
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,400
and the lease is 20 %.

240
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,600
Well, don't sell dope then, Frank.

241
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,200
Get a real job.
Need a fuckin job, Frank?

242
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,000
Is that what you need?
You come work for me.

243
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,200
You can drive me around.
You open my doors.

244
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,500
Yes sir, no sir, right away sir.
Anything you want, Master Johnson.

245
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,200
20 %.

246
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,700
20 % is my profit, Tango.

247
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,300
I give you that, what do I got left?
Nothing.

248
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,500
20 % puts me and everyone you know
out of business.

249
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,200
There are legitimate ways
of doing things,

250
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,200
and there's this way.
Not even Bumpy took 20 %.

251
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,400
Bumpy's fuckin dead.

252
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,100
My man.

253
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,900
20 %?

254
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,100
20 %.

255
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,200
Doc! Let's go.

256
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,500
<i>The drug problem in Vietnam
is more</i>

257
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,300
<i>than marijuana.
At this point,</i>

258
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,200
<i>it is estimated that one third
of American troops are experimenting</i>

259
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,000
<i>with opium and heroin.</i>

260
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,700
<i>The authorities say they've confiscated</i>

261
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:08,300
<i>large quantities of marijuana,
heroin, and pills.</i>

262
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,500
<i>Every person and every vehicle
going through the gates</i>

263
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,900
<i>is subject to a thorough shakedown.</i>

264
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,800
<i>Soldiers have access to the drugs</i>

265
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,200
<i>at many rest and relaxation spots
in Bangkok, Saigon, and other areas</i>

266
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,100
<i>throughout Vietnam and Thailand.</i>

267
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,500
<i>Officials say the easy availability</i>

268
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,800
<i>of relatively cheap cost
of high purity heroin</i>

269
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,100
<i>throughout Saigon and the Far East</i>

270
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,500
<i>is leading to an epidemic
of heroin addiction</i>

271
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,300
<i>among U.S. soldiers.</i>

272
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,900
<i>- Operator.
- Yeah, international.</i>

273
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,200
<i>- What city?
- Bangkok.</i>

274
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,600
<i>You know the country code?</i>

275
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,000
Yeah, 376.

276
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,300
<i>- For the first 3 minutes, it'll...
- I got it, I got it.</i>

277
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,400
<i>- Sawadeekap.
- Hello?</i>

278
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,300
<i>"Soul brothers".
Can I help you?</i>

279
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,300
Nate!

280
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,900
<i>- Do I know you?
- It's me.</i>

281
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,600
<i>- Who?
- Me, Frank! Your cousin, negro.</i>

282
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,300
Go get yourself a new suit.

283
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,100
Look, I'm sorry.

284
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,600
Please, Richie.

285
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,700
Couldn't be avoided.
I'll take him next weekend, OK?

286
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,900
We're moving.

287
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,100
What? Where?

288
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,500
The St. Regis.
What do you care?

289
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,900
My sister's.

290
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,900
Your sister's. In Vegas?

291
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,400
- Yeah.
- You're not moving to Las Vegas.

292
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,800
Not with Michael.

293
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,900
What am I supposed to do with him?
Leave him with you?

294
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,600
There's a picture.

295
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,700
Hey, guys!
Be cool.

296
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,800
Laurie, Las Vegas

297
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,800
is not the kind of place
to raise a kid.

298
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,600
Oh, like this is a good environment?

299
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,200
And around your friends?

300
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,100
When am I supposed to see my boy?

301
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,100
This weekend, last weekeend.

302
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,400
I asked you nice to shut up, right?

303
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,200
Now I'll have to kill you.
I swear

304
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,900
I'll pull out my gun
and put a bullet in your fuckin head!

305
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Stop what you're doin,
and pick up the glass!

306
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,700
Calm down, man. Be cool.

307
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,800
He's fuckin crazy.

308
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,200
You don't have a gun.

309
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,700
You sure?

310
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,700
You're crazy, Richie.

311
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,800
You don't have room for us.

312
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,600
I'll see you in court.

313
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,700
Come on, Michael!

314
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,800
Say bye to your dad.

315
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,700
Hey, kiddo!

316
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,300
See you next week.
We'll do something.

317
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,000
Let's get you an ice cream.

318
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,700
<i>You have 10 minutes remaining.</i>

319
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,200
10 minutes.

320
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,700
Girl, don't talk.
I wanna do a little funk.

321
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,700
How much you want?

322
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,200
Tell him I want a 100 kis.

323
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,700
Ain't nobody I know
who can get you that much.

324
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,000
You have to piece it together
from different sources.

325
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,900
And it's not gonna be 100 % pure.

326
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,100
I don't want that.

327
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,900
I know what you don't want.

328
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:19,300
But you'll need to get
to the Chi-Chou syndicate, all right?

329
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,300
In Cholon, Saigon.
If they'll deal with you at all.

330
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,900
I understand, but
by then, it'll be too late.

331
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,600
It'll be already chopped up.
I want to get it where they get it from.

332
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,800
The source.

333
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,100
- And get it yourself?
- Why not?

334
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,400
I came this far.

335
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,700
- You'd go into the motherfuckin jungle?
- I'm in it. Look around,

336
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,800
They're eating these roaches,
whatever that is.

337
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,500
Nigga, I'm talking about snakes.

338
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:46,200
Tigers, Vietcongs, mosquitos
that'll fuckin kill your ass.

339
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,400
- You wanna go into the jungle?
- We're going.

340
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,900
- Fuck it, let's go.
- We're going.

341
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Why not?

342
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,100
Hey, Frank.

343
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:44,300
This whole spot's locked down
by the Kuomintang.

344
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,300
General Chang Kai Chek's
defeated army.

345
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,100
How would you get it into the States?

346
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,300
You ain't got to worry about that.

347
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,800
- Who do you work for in there?
- Don't worry about that either.

348
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,500
Who are you really?

349
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,700
Frank Lucas,
like it says on my passport.

350
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,500
- I mean, who you represent?
- Me.

351
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,800
You think you're going to take
a 100 kilos of heroin into the U.S.

352
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,200
and you don't work for anyone?
Someone's going to allow that?

353
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,300
That's right.

354
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,600
After this first purchase...

355
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,900
if you're not killed
by Marseilles importers...

356
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,800
or their people in the States...

357
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,500
then, what?

358
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,000
Then there'll be more, much more.
I guarantee you.

359
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,000
And if it's all the same to you, I don't
have to drag my ass here no more.

360
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,800
Of course not.

361
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
My man.

362
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,100
- Soul brothers?
- Soul brothers.

363
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:16,400
Fifty grand. It'll cover them,
the pilot and the boys on the other end.

364
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,100
Give them a hundred.

365
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,500
Fifty will cover it.

366
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,300
Give them a hundred, the whole thing.

367
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,100
And look.

368
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,400
That's all I got.

369
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,100
If that dope don't arrive,
for any reason...

370
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,900
Listen.

371
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,900
Cousin or no cousin,
I'm a busy man, all right?

372
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,500
I got no time to go
to nobody's funeral.

373
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,800
I'll let you know
when it's in the air.

374
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,500
My man.

375
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,800
<i>Richie?
Fuckin guy made me,</i>

376
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,900
don't know how he did,
but he did.

377
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,800
<i>He went for his gun!</i>

378
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,500
I had to do it, man!

379
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,100
A hundred people out there heard

380
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,400
the shot. You gotta help me,
you gotta do something!

381
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,800
Where are you, Jay?

382
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,500
That's the problem.

383
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,600
Dispatch, I got a 10-13.

384
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,100
I got a 10-13.

385
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,300
<i>Copy that. What's your 20?</i>

386
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,200
Tower 2.

387
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,400
Floor 1G.

388
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,300
Canton West, in the projects.

389
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,300
<i>- Identify yourself, please.
- Detective Richard Roberts.</i>

390
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,000
<i>Negative, I got no units in that area.</i>

391
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,300
Bullshit.

392
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,400
Please put the call out again.
I'll need assistance.

393
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,000
<i>Det. Roberts, I got no units
in that area, that's a negative.</i>

394
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,500
Why you goin' thru, motherfucker?

395
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,300
Be cool!

396
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,900
Be cool, all right?

397
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,200
I'll find out what's going on in here.

398
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,300
Richie.

399
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,900
<i>Open the motherfuckin door!</i>

400
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,300
Where's your backup ?

401
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,700
You got no backup?
Why is that?

402
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,800
Bandage his neck.

403
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,600
- Richie, he's dead.
- I know he's fuckin dead, right?

404
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:09,400
Bandage his neck, clean up his head.
Prop him up on the gurney

405
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,500
so he's sittin,
and open his fuckin eyes.

406
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,200
- All right? Let's go!
- Fuck.

407
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,900
OK, clean him up.

408
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,500
Give me your gun.

409
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,800
Your gun!

410
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,300
You have your badge?

411
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,300
You guys ready?

412
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,300
Just keep moving forward.

413
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,600
- You all right?
- Yeah.

414
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,200
It's OK!

415
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,500
Injured man coming out.
Step back.

416
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,700
Let them do their job.
He'll be all right.

417
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,300
Step back.

418
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,800
That's fine.
That's it.

419
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,500
He's alive.

420
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,100
What happened inside?

421
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Thanks, man.

422
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,500
Fuck.

423
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,000
The asshole pulled a piece on me.
Can you fuckin believe it?

424
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,800
He pulls a piece on a cop?
Had to do it, man.

425
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,300
Kill or be killed.

426
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,000
Fuckin crazy world, right?

427
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,000
What the fuck were you doing
on the projects?

428
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,700
Investigating stuff, man,
you know.

429
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,200
Just like you taught me.

430
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,100
Checking on guys,
following things up,

431
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,000
putting the pieces together.

432
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,400
The guy was a fucking dealer.
Scum of the earth!

433
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,700
That guy
didn't pull a gun on a cop, Jay.

434
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,900
That guy pulled a gun on a junkie.

435
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,500
The junkie was trying to rob him.

436
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,100
What the fuck you sayin?

437
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,700
What the fuck you doin, man?

438
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,100
- What the fuck is that?
- That money's mine, man!

439
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,000
I earned this shit!
It's mine!

440
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,900
I earned it doing good cop work.

441
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,600
- I got it doin good cop work!
- You murdered him!

442
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,900
- And gettin shot at!
- You murdered the guy!

443
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,600
You murdered him,
you robbed his money,

444
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,300
then you called me to get you out.

445
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,100
Makes me an accessory after the fact.

446
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,500
I'll tell you the facts,

447
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,100
just write the report
the way i see it happened.

448
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,100
And then that's the way it is.

449
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,200
And that's how it'll all be.

450
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,600
I can't do that.

451
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:42,500
I'm a leper because I listened to you
and turned in a million bucks.

452
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,600
No one will work with me after that.

453
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,900
I can give up this shit, Richie!

454
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,500
That's easy.

455
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,700
Just write the report.

456
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,300
Between us.

457
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,700
As partners.

458
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,700
I can't do that.

459
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,900
Stop!

460
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,900
Open the trunk.

461
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,600
<i>Get out!
Get out of Vietnam!</i>

462
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,100
<i>As loud as we can
that the Vietnam war should stop,</i>

463
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,300
<i>and that the best way to stop it
is for the United States</i>

464
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,800
<i>to simply pack up
and get out of Vietnam right now!</i>

465
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,800
How are we looking?

466
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,100
Typically what I see
is 25 to 45 % pure.

467
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,400
There are no adulterants, no alkaloids,
no dilutents.

468
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,000
It's a hundred percent.

469
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,200
- May I?
- Take it with you.

470
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,000
Thank you, Frank.

471
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:51,900
I'll take it.

472
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,500
No contingencies, no loan,
no nothing.

473
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Cash.

474
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,300
Fabulous.

475
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,500
I’m not talking
about your proclivities.

476
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,900
Those I only know too well.
I’m talking about being a cop.

477
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,800
You talking about taking money?

478
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,800
I don't do that.
Not my thing.

479
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,500
And your friends from the hood,
still hang out with them?

480
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,800
Yeah. Play baseball on the weekends.

481
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,300
Wise guys?
It's gonna look good.

482
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,200
Guys I went to school with, so what?

483
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,100
What about Joseph Sadano?

484
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,900
What about him?

485
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,700
I’m just trying to understand
things your wife has said.

486
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,600
- If they're not true, tell me.
- Yeah, he’s one of them.

487
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,100
Is he also your son’s godfather?

488
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,200
He's definitely fucking her.

489
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,200
Do you really care about this?

490
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,200
Or do you just not want her
to win ever?

491
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,200
You know there's an interview room?
On the second floor.

492
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,600
- That's what I thought.
- Door locks from the inside.

493
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,000
All rise!

494
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,000
Fuck me like a cop, not a lawyer.

495
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,100
Don't answer!

496
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,500
- Richie Roberts.
- Hey, Norm!

497
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,600
- Richie Roberts.
- Hi, Det. Norman Riley.

498
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,400
- Hi, Norman. How are you?
- Good.

499
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,100
- Is that him?
- Yeah.

500
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,400
Nice night to come out, huh?
It's like Grand Central around here.

501
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,600
It's been like this.

502
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,800
I'm lucky if I get home by midnight.

503
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,000
It's like nothing we've seen before.

504
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,700
Something I gotta sign?

505
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,600
Yeah, this way.

506
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,900
I'm taking this with me.
I'll register it, all right?

507
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,000
<i>America's public enemy number one</i>

508
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:29,000
<i>in the United States
is drug abuse.</i>

509
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,500
<i>In order
to fight and defeat this ennemy,</i>

510
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,400
<i>It is necessary to wage</i>

511
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,600
<i>a new all out offensive.</i>

512
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,500
<i>Federal authorities
have announced their intention</i>

513
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:44,000
<i>to establish special
narcotics bureaus in Washington</i>

514
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,000
<i>New York, Los Angeles, Chicago...</i>

515
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,900
A detective without the support

516
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:50,400
of his fellow detectives
really can't do much.

517
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,000
You know why I don't have it.

518
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:57,500
Doesn't matter.
You do what you have to do.

519
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,400
The greatest city in the world
is turning into an open sewer.

520
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,000
Everybody's stealing.

521
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,000
Dealing.

522
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,300
You can't work
because you did your job!

523
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,600
Good news is you're not
the only honest cop in town.

524
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,100
This special narcotics bureau
in Washington

525
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,100
is not a dog and pony show.

526
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,200
They're sincere.

527
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,300
I know it because
they want us to orchestrate it

528
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,800
and I want you
to head up things here on our end.

529
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,600
If it's federal,
who do I answer to?

530
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,300
- Post office?
- You answer to me.

531
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,900
Me and the U.S. Attorney,
nobody else.

532
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,100
You never step foot
in a police station again,

533
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,900
work out at your own place.

534
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,300
You pick your own guys,

535
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,800
Guys that you know wouldn’t
take a nickel off the sidewalk.

536
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,700
<i>- Huey.
- Huey!</i>

537
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,700
<i>- What of what?
- Who's this?</i>

538
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,000
Who you think, boy?

539
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,300
<i>- Frank!
- Frank who?</i>

540
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,200
<i>Your brother, negro.</i>

541
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,000
- That's right.
- Marvin!

542
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,700
- Where's Ma?
- What?

543
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,900
Where's...
Frank's on the phone!

544
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,600
How you doin, Frankie?

545
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,200
Frank, on the phone!

546
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,400
- Say what?
- Ma, Frank on the phone!

547
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:30,900
Oh, my Lord!

548
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,200
Yo, when?
You just say it, man.

549
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,600
<i>I'll call you back</i>

550
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,100
at 6 o'clock.
Get everybody together, all right?

551
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,300
Mama, everybody.

552
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,300
How you doin, Uncle Frank?

553
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,900
Get out of the car!
It's here.

554
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,500
Look at this!

555
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,700
My Lord!

556
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,000
So glad to see you, boy.

557
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:15,900
I'm telling you,
some piece of land you got here.

558
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,800
- I wonder what the Boro people'd say.
- And whose house is that?

559
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,800
That is your house, Mama.

560
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:24,300
- Mine?
- That's yours.

561
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,000
And who else?

562
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:43,100
Listen!

563
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,300
I wanna tell you how happy I am.

564
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,600
Seeing all my children at the table,

565
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,900
and the grand children
at the same time.

566
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,600
I'm so happy!

567
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:53,900
- Right on, Grandma!
- Enjoy yourselves.

568
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,300
I hope you got a job,
the way you eatin all this.

569
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,800
That boy, he got an arm on him.

570
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,700
A Major League arm.

571
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,200
- Oh yeah?
- Right?

572
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,300
Right on, Pop.

573
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,200
After dinner,
let's see him throw around a bit.

574
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,900
You can't catch him, man.

575
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,800
I'm telling you,
he throws harder than Gibson.

576
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,500
We're talking 95 miles an hour.

577
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,900
Can you catch him?

578
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:18,600
He'd go catch the grass.

579
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,400
He might have catched that thing
when I was about 5 years old.

580
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:23,200
Since then, he can't keep up.

581
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,600
This is your room.

582
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:29,800
Perfect.

583
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,000
Look at this.

584
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,300
It's beautiful.

585
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,200
Real beautiful, this.

586
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:49,600
How did you...

587
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,200
I had it made.

588
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,300
From memory.

589
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,200
You were 5 when they took it away.

590
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,700
- Right.
- How could you...

591
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,500
How could I forget, Mamma?

592
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:05,900
I thought you did.

593
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,200
It, it... is perfect.

594
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,300
It's all perfect.

595
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,300
I can't tell you
how much I love you.

596
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,100
I love you too, Mother.

597
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:22,500
It's okay.

598
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,600
Both these guys, good with wires.
They got solid informants.

599
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:36,200
They're honest.

600
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,600
And fearless.

601
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,900
They're insane, Richie,
like you.

602
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,000
Where are they?

603
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,600
That's Jones,
with the skinny white broad.

604
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,000
Best I've ever seen on the street.

605
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,700
He knows dope,
but he's together.

606
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,700
He's a stand up guy, all around.

607
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:57,600
That's Abruzzo

608
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,500
with the two black fat ones.

609
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,500
He loves a big ass, man.

610
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:05,600
He's a bulldog.

611
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,800
He don't fuck around,
he got a bit of a temper yeah, but,

612
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:11,400
you could trust this guy
with your grandma.

613
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:12,900
Listen.

614
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,100
We work together. You want me,
you got to take them, too.

615
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:29,900
When do we start?

616
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,300
<i>The man I worked for</i>

617
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,200
ran one of the biggest companies
in New York City for more than 50 years.

618
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:40,200
15 years,

619
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,300
8 months and 9 days

620
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,100
I was with him every day,

621
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,000
protected him, looked after him.
I learned from him.

622
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:51,100
Bumpy was rich,
but wasn't white man rich.

623
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,600
He wasn't wealthy.

624
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,200
He didn’t own his own company.
He thought he did.

625
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,600
He just managed it.

626
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,900
White men owned it,
so they owned him.

627
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:01,000
Nobody owns me though.

628
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,800
- How you doin, babe?
- Good.

629
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,000
Cause I own my own company,
and my company sells a product

630
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,200
that’s better than the competition’s.

631
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,700
At a price that’s lower
than the competition’s.

632
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,400
What are we selling here?

633
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,500
How you doin, Red?

634
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,300
My brothers,
just got here from North Carolina,

635
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:35,700
Guys, this is Redtop.

636
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,100
- How you doin?
- And the ladies.

637
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:39,400
Nice family.

638
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:41,900
What? Ya'll niggas
never seen hoochie before?

639
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:43,900
Why they all naked?

640
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,700
So they can steal nothin.

641
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:51,100
Most important thing in business
is honesty.

642
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,000
Integrity, hard work.

643
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,400
Family.

644
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,300
Never forgetting
where we came from.

645
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,000
Thank you, Charlene.

646
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,700
See, you are what you are
in this world.

647
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:10,500
That's either one of two things.

648
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,700
Either you're somebody.

649
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,100
Or nobody.
I'll be right back.

650
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,600
I need this fresh,

651
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,900
cause if I come back here,
you'll know what it is.

652
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,600
- You don't play that.
- I hear you,

653
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,400
you won't have to come back.
There will be no problem.

654
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:43,500
Where's my money?

655
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:46,200
Redtop gave you the package,
you supposed to hand me my money.

656
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,200
Here's a jar right here.
20 %.

657
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,100
- You got the jar?
- That's right.

658
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:52,900
Get the fuck outa here...

659
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,300
What you gonna do?
What the fuck you gonna do?

660
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:57,600
What you doin?

661
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,800
You wanna shoot me,
in front of everybody?

662
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,100
Huh? Come on!

663
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:04,900
Shit.

664
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:18,100
Here you go.

665
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,800
20 %.

666
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,000
So, what was I sayin?

667
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:59,000
This is the newly formed
Essex County narcotics squad.

668
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:04,300
Our mandate is to make major arrests.
No street guys.

669
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,900
We're looking for the suppliers
and the distributors.

670
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,000
Heroin, cocaine, amphetamines.

671
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,900
No grass under 1,000 pounds.
No powder under 40 kilos.

672
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,300
Less than that,
someone else can waste their time.

673
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,600
We'll be handling big shipments,
big money,

674
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,100
and big temptation.

675
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:21,200
I heard a story about you.
That you found

676
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:24,500
a million $ in unmarked cash.
And you gave that shit back.

677
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,100
Is that true?

678
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:28,700
Yeah, I did.
Anyone got a problem with that?

679
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:36,100
So do I.
I think about it everyday.

680
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:39,300
I should be down in Florida with
a 68 full cruiser dual, fishing sharks.

681
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,000
- You and me both.
- But you know...

682
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,200
I didn't, so here I am, and...

683
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,600
We'll try to land
some other kinda sharks.

684
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,300
- All right?
- Bingo.

685
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,200
See that?

686
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,400
And this stuff is everyday's stuff.

687
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:45,700
But this Blue Magic,

688
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:47,200
twice the potency.

689
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,800
The purest thing
I've ever seen in the street.

690
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,700
Strong enough to smoke.

691
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,000
That's for those suburban
white kids scared of needles.

692
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,000
You paid 10 bucks for that?

693
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,700
And it's everywhere,
on every corner.

694
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:01,400
So how's that possible?

695
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:05,100
Who can afford to sell shit
twice as good for half as much?

696
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,000
Hey man, good to see you!

697
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,100
- Doin good?
- Yeah, just got back

698
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:19,900
from a trip to the south of France.

699
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,400
Know what I'm sayin?

700
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,100
Here you go!

701
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:45,100
Who is that?

702
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,100
Ladies and gentlemen.

703
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,700
The Proud Bomber, the champ.

704
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:02,900
Mr. Joe Louis!

705
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,400
Who's that with Joe?

706
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:15,100
Miss Puerto Rico.

707
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Puerto Rico?

708
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,500
- She a beauty queen.
- Real. The beauty queen.

709
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,300
My main man.

710
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,200
Excuse us for a minute, please.

711
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,600
Sure, Frank.

712
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:00,100
Thank you.

713
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,500
What's goin on?

714
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:06,900
What you smiling about?

715
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:08,500
- I dunno.
- What is this?

716
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:09,900
What's what?

717
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:11,600
- What?
- Come here.

718
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,200
What's that you wearin?

719
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:16,600
What's what?

720
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:18,900
That, what you got on?

721
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:20,800
A very, very, very nice suit.

722
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,300
Very, very nice suit, huh?

723
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,200
That's a clown suit,
a costume, man,

724
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,600
with a big sign that says:
"Arrest me".

725
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,300
Understand? You too loud,
you're making too much noise.

726
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:31,600
Look at me.
The loudest one in the room

727
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:34,700
is the weakest one in the room,
I tell you that.

728
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:38,400
- You tryin to be like Nicky Barnes?
- What's the problem with him?

729
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,700
- I like him.
- I got no problem. You like him?

730
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:43,000
You wanna be like him?
You wanna be Superfly?

731
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,800
You wanna work for him?

732
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,800
Share a jail cell with him?
Cook for him?

733
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:50,000
- He wants to talk to you.
- So, you talkin to him about me now?

734
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:51,600
What about?

735
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:53,400
- It ain't like that.
- Then what is it?

736
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:55,400
- Your name came up.
- About what?

737
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,300
I don't know, I told him I'd tell you.

738
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:02,000
You know, boy...

739
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,600
If you wasn't my bro', I'd kill you.
You know that?

740
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,800
I'd blow your fuckin brains out.

741
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:11,300
- Don't be like that.
- I'm taking you shoppin this week.

742
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,900
- I can do it alone.
- I can tell.

743
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,400
You still owe me that dance.

744
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:49,700
Doc, come on.

745
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,200
Frank.

746
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:52,800
Check this.

747
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:04,800
- How you doing?
- Hi.

748
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:07,000
- Frank Lucas.
- Eva Jendo.

749
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,000
Nice to meet you, Eva.

750
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:10,900
Nice to meet you, Frank.

751
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:13,900
You're Frank,
and this is your place.

752
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:16,700
That's right, I'm Frank
and this is my place.

753
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:24,500
Why is it called Small's?

754
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:26,300
Why not Frank's?

755
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:30,300
When you own something,
you call it what you want.

756
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:32,700
Small's.

757
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:34,400
Or Frank's.

758
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:36,100
Frankie Small's.

759
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,400
Small's Frankie.

760
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:40,400
That's right.

761
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:42,900
You want to let my hand go?

762
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:46,100
Okay.

763
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:48,600
You're leaving?

764
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,300
No, I was going to my table.

765
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,400
You need someone to go with you?

766
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Yes?

767
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,300
Wash your hand?
I got one print of that.

768
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,600
You'll smudge it.

769
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,600
- Here you go.
- What about him?

770
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,300
- Who's that?
- Joey Sadano.

771
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,800
Don Cattano's nephew.

772
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,900
- Put him up there by the big man
- He looks like you, Abruzzo.

773
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,100
- Not as handsome.

774
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,500
- Looks more like your sister.
- Where's Ice Pick Paul?

775
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:21,800
Funny. You guys should
take that show on the road.

776
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,800
So we need...
Ice Pick Paul.

777
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:26,900
There you go.

778
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:29,700
He goes near the top.

779
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:33,300
No, Ice Pick Paul is a soldier,
this guy is a lieutenant.

780
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,600
"...you have passed the
New Jersey Bar Examination."

781
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:39,100
That guy is a soldier.

782
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:41,200
This guy's a lieutenant.
No way he's on top.

783
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,700
You're thinking Benny the Bishop.
Benny Two Socks,

784
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:46,800
- Cattano's deadbeat son-in-law.
- Jonesy's right.

785
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:50,200
Which one of you has actually seen
Ice Pick Paul selling drugs?

786
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:51,900
Actually,

787
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:54,000
- seen it go down?
- Yeah, seen it go down,

788
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:56,300
been in his place,
seen him handle drugs?

789
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,000
That rat Rickie has told us.

790
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,700
He's fuckin dead!

791
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:01,400
About 4 weeks ago.

792
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,100
He's dead.

793
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,200
Well, we can take him
off the fuckin board.

794
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:09,000
I don't think
we got any solid evidence

795
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,200
on anybody on that board.

796
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:14,200
What you saying?
This is weeks and weeks of work, man.

797
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:17,400
I say take it down.
We start again from the street.

798
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:23,100
That's considerably more
than one year's salary.

799
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,100
If it disappears...

800
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:28,700
we'll not be able
to get it for you again.

801
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:31,500
That's yours.

802
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:33,500
Sign on my life for you again?

803
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:35,700
For a lousy twenty grand?

804
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:40,600
It has to be Blue Magic, OK?

805
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,200
It's gonna be Blue.

806
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:45,100
- Pick it up here tomorrow.
- $ 20,000.

807
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:46,800
Just leave it there.

808
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:02,700
- How did it go?
- Good.

809
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:06,300
Here he comes.

810
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:07,900
- That's him?
- Yeah.

811
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:10,300
He's quick.

812
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:25,100
- He goes into the City. What do we do?
- Stay with the fuckin money.

813
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,000
We stay with the money, all right?

814
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,800
- We can't go there!
- Yes, we can.

815
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:31,200
That's 20 grand in there
that I'm responsible for.

816
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:34,300
- I ain't losin it, follow the money!
- It's out of our jurisdiction!

817
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,400
- Follow the money!
- All right!

818
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:52,800
He's pulling over.

819
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,500
All right, here we go.

820
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:56,300
Let me out here.

821
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:01,600
- Don't disappear, all right?
- I'll circle the block.

822
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:41,200
Sit down!

823
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:45,100
Happy birthday, gentlemen.
How you doin?

824
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:48,600
<i>You're up to something, huh?
He's going bowling.</i>

825
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,200
Look at that.
Right between the legs.

826
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:53,900
- What's in the bag?
- Nothing.

827
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,100
Get the fuck up!

828
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,800
<i>- It's my bag.
- Shut the fuck up! What did I tell you?</i>

829
01:02:58,100 --> 01:03:00,000
<i>- Keep your your head down!
- What you doin?</i>

830
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:02,300
<i>- Sit down and shut up!
- Don't you move!</i>

831
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,200
Hey guys!

832
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:17,700
Guys! Officers!

833
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:20,900
I'm Richie Roberts.
Newark.

834
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:24,300
That's... my money.

835
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:27,400
What the fuck?
What money?

836
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:32,100
The bills are sequenced,
they're registered with the Essex

837
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,800
County Prosecutors Office.

838
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,700
Check them up.
They all start with CF3500.

839
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Have a look.

840
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,200
Fucking registers.

841
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:47,200
I thought I had a fucking Chris-Craft
sitting in my driveway.

842
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:48,800
Honest mistake.

843
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:50,500
I'll just get the money.

844
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:53,300
This time.

845
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,900
When's the last time I was in Jersey?
Let me think.

846
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:03,300
Never.

847
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,500
What’re you doing coming over here
unannounced?

848
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:09,800
You know you can get hurt
doing that?

849
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:13,500
You got your fucking money.

850
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:14,700
Richie.

851
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:16,900
And never ever

852
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,200
come into this city again unannounced.

853
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:21,700
You come in to see
a fuckin Broadway show?

854
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,300
You call ahead first to see
if it’s okay with me.

855
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:27,500
No problem.

856
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,300
- Go hit some ball.
- Great suits.

857
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:38,500
Is that your car?

858
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:40,700
Fucking great car.

859
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,600
Have a nice fuckin trip
back to Jersey.

860
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:45,200
All right.

861
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:47,700
Come on, I got a tea time.
Let's go.

862
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:02,000
This is your father?

863
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,000
That's Martin Luther King.

864
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,800
- It is not.
- Yes, it is Martin Luther King.

865
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,500
- You know, "I have a dream".
- Of course.

866
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,100
No, that's...

867
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:15,200
He was just as important
as Martin Luther King.

868
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:17,500
- To me.
- What did he do?

869
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:21,100
A lot of things, he was a...
friend.

870
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:24,300
Served New York,
New York served him.

871
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:26,900
He was my boss.

872
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:28,600
My teacher.

873
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:30,500
What did he teach you?

874
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:32,800
He taught me a lot of things. He...

875
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,900
Taught me how to take my time.

876
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:42,200
That if I was going to do something,
to do it with care, love.

877
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:44,400
Anything else?

878
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:50,900
Taught me to be a gentleman.

879
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:52,800
That's what you are?

880
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,200
That's what I try to be.
Come here.

881
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,900
Come sit here.

882
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:01,800
Look at me.

883
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,800
I own about five apartments
in Manhattan.

884
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:10,000
Homes all over the East Coast.
Could've taken you to anyone of'em,

885
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,300
but I didn't.
I brought you here.

886
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,100
- I was looking for you, boy.
- Cause I want you to meet my mother.

887
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:17,800
How you doin, Ma?

888
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:19,900
- Is this her?
- Eva,

889
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:21,600
- this is my mother.
- Hi, Eva.

890
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:23,500
Nice to meet you.

891
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:25,000
She's beautiful.

892
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:26,700
Look at her.

893
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,300
She's an angel

894
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:30,200
come down from Heaven.

895
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:31,700
Thank you.

896
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:40,900
Mr. Roberts.

897
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:43,200
I'm here for our appointment.

898
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,000
- Morning.
- Morning.

899
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:53,100
Sorry, our appointment?

900
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:55,200
Child Social Services.

901
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:11,900
She did mention your name though.

902
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,600
- The stewardess?
- No, not her.

903
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:19,500
The lady from Social Services,
she mentioned your name.

904
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:22,100
Right after she asked me

905
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:24,500
if I associated with any criminals.

906
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:26,500
- All right, go!
- You want to see this?

907
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:27,900
Hey, boys!

908
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:29,700
Joey!

909
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:31,800
Get in the pool.

910
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:34,400
Come on!

911
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:41,300
How'd she get my name?

912
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:42,600
Laurie.

913
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:45,900
She's been saying a lot lately.

914
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:48,300
A lot.

915
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:54,700
When you asked me to be
your son's godfather,

916
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:56,500
- I took it very seriously.
- I know.

917
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:58,100
And I appreciate that.

918
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:01,000
And I said yes, I would take on
that responsability

919
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:03,900
to take care of your son, if God forbid,
something happened to you.

920
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:06,700
Jo, the things she said
to Child Social Services

921
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,300
make me look really bad.

922
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:09,400
You know.

923
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:11,700
All kinds at the house at night time,

924
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:14,200
low life informants around.
Women...

925
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:15,900
Old friends like me.

926
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,500
Old friends like you, yeah.

927
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:22,700
Uncle Joey!
Watch me!

928
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:27,900
I understand.

929
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:30,700
They ask me, I'll tell them
what you want me to tell.

930
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:32,900
- I'll lie for you.
- Don't lie.

931
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:34,400
You don't have to lie.

932
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:37,400
Just... omit certain details.

933
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:39,500
Sure, all right.

934
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:44,500
I have something else to ask you.

935
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:47,100
You don't have to answer
if you don't want.

936
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,100
Blue Magic.

937
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:52,400
Anything?

938
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,800
A lot of sorrow, misery from guys
getting put out of work. That's all.

939
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:01,200
What, your guys?

940
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:02,800
His guys.

941
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,100
You know where it's comin from?

942
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:09,400
Guys down south,
that's all I heard.

943
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:11,800
- Cubans?
- I dunno.

944
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:14,300
Or Mexico?

945
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:16,100
Don't know.

946
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:18,900
You're telling me
it's from South America?

947
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:20,100
I don't know!

948
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:25,300
Whoever it is, they're upsetting
the natural order of things.

949
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:27,600
That's all there is.

950
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:45,300
<i>- What's up?
- My man.</i>

951
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:46,600
<i>How's it lookin?</i>

952
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:17,700
I want you to meet Mike Sobota.

953
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,500
- How're you doing?
- How're you?

954
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:21,900
- What can I get you?
- A left hander, Charlie told me

955
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,500
- about your nephew.
- Oh, Mr...

956
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:25,900
- Yankees.
- Yeah, yeah! Hey, Steve!

957
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:27,500
- Come here.
- Excuse me.

958
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:30,300
He's good. Put him in the team.
You're good enough, right?

959
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:33,000
I'm a Lucas.
Good enough on a bad day.

960
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:36,000
So don't make it a bad day,
make it a good day, you understand?

961
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:40,400
Excuse me. Police department.
Now back out, baby.

962
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:45,300
I'll take your ass in, Jimmy.

963
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:47,400
You can't take me in for that.

964
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,900
I got a licence for that, motherfucker.

965
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:52,700
You got a licence for this?
Excuse me, all right?

966
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:56,900
Shit, all right!

967
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:00,800
I got to arrest you.
Shit's too good to be on the street.

968
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,400
- What you doin, man?
- You ain't arresting nobody.

969
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,400
You bribing me now?

970
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:10,300
I tell you what,
I'm arresting everybody. All of you.

971
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:11,700
You first!

972
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:18,900
- How can that be?
- What was that?

973
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:21,100
Get this fuckin...
what's the matter with you?

974
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:22,700
- What was that?
- What?

975
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,900
- What the hell's wrong with you?
- What's your fuckin problem?

976
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,400
I just shot him in the leg.

977
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:33,900
Damn, Jimmy!

978
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:36,600
Get up!

979
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:51,700
Everybody, get out!

980
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:53,100
Get out!

981
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:57,100
- Frank, it was an accident.
- Wasn't no goddamn accident.

982
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:00,400
He don't feel shit cause he's coked up
all the motherfuckin time!

983
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:03,200
He's your driver,
get rid of him.

984
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:04,700
He's your cousin!

985
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:06,600
He ain't shit to me,
he means nothin.

986
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:09,200
- What'll he do, go back home?
- I don't give a damn!

987
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:10,500
Send his ass home!

988
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:13,500
Don't rub on that.
You'd block that.

989
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:17,400
You understand?
That's alpaga, $25,000 alpaga.

990
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,700
You'd block that shit.
Don't rub, put club soda on it.

991
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,100
Listen, from now on,

992
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:26,300
don't nobody talk to me directly,
understand?

993
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:27,800
You got business with me,

994
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,100
you talk to Huey,
Huey talks to me, got it?

995
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,800
- All right.
- Never on the phone, got it?

996
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,300
And take them
goddamn sunglasses off!

997
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:39,300
- Take the goddamn sunglasses off!
- Damn it, man!

998
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:44,500
Simple-minded ass motherfuckers.

999
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:01,800
The whole place was imported

1000
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,200
brick by brick.

1001
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:06,700
Gloucestershire.

1002
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:09,700
- Who?
- Quite famous.

1003
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:11,700
Yours.

1004
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:17,900
Here you go.

1005
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Pull!

1006
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:30,700
Come, Eva.

1007
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:35,000
I'm sure you're dying to see
the rest of the house.

1008
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:40,900
Of course. Excuse me.

1009
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:45,400
Thank you for a wonderful lunch.
It was delicious.

1010
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:51,200
What do you think of monopolies?

1011
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,300
- You mean, like the game?
- No, I just think

1012
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:57,800
monopolies are made illegal
in the country, Frank,

1013
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
cause no one wants to compete.

1014
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:03,000
Nobody wants to compete,
not with a monopoly.

1015
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,100
Let the dairy farmers do that,

1016
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,400
half of them'd
go out of business tomorrow.

1017
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:11,300
- I’m just trying to make a living.
- It's your right.

1018
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Everybody's right. It's America.

1019
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:18,400
We just can't do it
at the unreasonable expense of others.

1020
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:21,400
Cause it becomes un-American.

1021
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,800
That's why the price we pay
for that gallon of milk

1022
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,800
never represents the true cost
of production

1023
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,400
cause it's gotta be controlled.
It's gotta be set.

1024
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,000
It's gotta be fair.

1025
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:32,600
Controlled by who?
I set a price I think is fair.

1026
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,300
- I don't think it is.
- You don't?

1027
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:35,500
I don't.

1028
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:37,800
I know your customers
are happy, Frank.

1029
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,300
Bunch of fuckin junkies
that they are.

1030
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:42,900
What about your fellow dairy farmers?

1031
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:45,300
Are you thinking of us?

1032
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,400
You thinking of them?

1033
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,300
The dairy farmers?

1034
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,800
I'm thinking of them, Dominic, about
as much as they've thought about me.

1035
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,400
I'm just thinking out loud.

1036
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:59,900
If you took some of your inventory,

1037
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:02,200
and you sold it wholesale.

1038
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,800
Sit.
We could work.

1039
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:09,500
You could use some distribution.

1040
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:13,900
I dunno, I'm pretty good.
I got 110th to 155th,

1041
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:15,700
river to river, I'm all right.

1042
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:19,100
It's kind of a mom and pop store
next to what I’m talking about,

1043
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:21,000
and that's bigger than K-Mart.

1044
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:24,000
I'm talking about L.A.,
Chicago, Detroit, Las Vegas.

1045
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:25,800
Let's go nationwide.

1046
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:28,900
I'm gonna guarantee you
peace of mind here.

1047
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:30,800
You don't want that?

1048
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,400
You gonna need it.

1049
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:35,800
I don't know how you feel me.

1050
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:37,900
I'm kind of a Renaissance man.

1051
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:39,900
The people I deal with on a daily basis,

1052
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:41,900
they're not enlightened.

1053
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:44,600
You talk to them about civil rights,
they don't know.

1054
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,100
They're not open to change.

1055
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:49,300
Not from the way things are done,
and who's doing it.

1056
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:53,100
I can talk to them,
so there's no misunderstanding.

1057
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:57,900
That's what I mean
by peace of mind.

1058
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:01,600
Here

1059
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:05,200
You're paying what,
75, 80 thousand a kilo?

1060
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:09,800
I'm a Renaissance man too.

1061
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:12,900
I'd consider 50,000.

1062
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:25,200
Why would you trust these people?
And the way they look at you.

1063
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:27,700
They look at me like it's Xmas
and I'm Santa Claus.

1064
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:29,700
They look at us like we're the help.

1065
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:32,600
They work for me, now.

1066
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,100
<i>I predict it when I meet Joe Frazier,</i>

1067
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:42,500
<i>this will be like a good amateur</i>

1068
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:44,600
<i>fighting a real professional.</i>

1069
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:47,200
<i>This will be like a kid
out of the Olympics...</i>

1070
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:49,300
That's gonna be Ali in three.

1071
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:52,000
C'mon, cat, you dig it?

1072
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:56,000
<i>- You're fightin Joe Frazier.
- It's no depth, and besides the point.</i>

1073
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:57,300
He's on pot, man.

1074
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:59,900
- Look at Frazier.
- Ali's craftsman, baby.

1075
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:02,000
<i>- I'll stop you.
- Stop me? You?</i>

1076
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:03,300
<i>How soon? What round?</i>

1077
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:05,500
<i>- No, don't let him obligate you.
- 1 to 10.</i>

1078
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,300
<i>You'll be out. I'll win.</i>

1079
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:10,200
<i>Time out.
March 8, 1971.</i>

1080
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:13,900
<i>Here we are at Madison Square Garden
for the fight of the century. </i>

1081
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:17,400
<i>And by anybody's definition,
this is a happening.</i>

1082
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,600
<i>There are handshakes, and of course,</i>

1083
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:21,800
<i>there are utterly beautiful women.</i>

1084
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,100
<i>But behind the smiles
and the handshakes,</i>

1085
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:26,900
<i>you can feel the atmosphere
so heavy with tension</i>

1086
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:28,700
<i>it's almost unbearable.</i>

1087
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:31,500
<i>Everybody's who's anybody is here.</i>

1088
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:33,900
<i>Like Sinatra, like Graziano.</i>

1089
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,400
<i>David Roth and Diahann Carroll.
Woody Allen and Diane Keaton.</i>

1090
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,400
<i>The celebrities are pouring in.</i>

1091
01:18:39,700 --> 01:18:42,400
<i>The way you all build it up,
Life Magazine cover,</i>

1092
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:45,300
<i>Time Magazine,

1093
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:47,900
<i>Joe Louis here says I'll lose.</i>

1094
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:51,500
<i>When Joe Louis says I'm gonna lose,
I know I feel wonderful.</i>

1095
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:54,800
<i>Joe Louis always picks the wrong man.</i>

1096
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:09,800
<i>Float like a butterfly,
sting like a bee!</i>

1097
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:12,100
Not watching the fight, Bob?

1098
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:13,700
I'm not into boxing.

1099
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:16,700
It ain't boxing, kid.

1100
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:18,900
It's politics.

1101
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:24,300
I got something for you too.

1102
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:29,700
A coat? For me?

1103
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:33,200
Do you like it?

1104
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:35,600
The coat? Yeah, it's nice.

1105
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:40,200
What do you think?

1106
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:41,700
- Yeah.
- You sure?

1107
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:51,500
Over here, Sammy!

1108
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:54,200
Hey, Sammy, get'em up!

1109
01:19:56,300 --> 01:19:57,700
Joe Louis, over here!

1110
01:19:58,100 --> 01:19:59,300
How's it goin, Frank?

1111
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:11,800
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

<i>because everyone's in here tonight.</i>

1117

Let's go, take your seats now.
C'mon!

1118
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:39,400
<i>Main event.</i>

1119

<i>- This is Frank Lucas.

1127
01:20:58,700 --> 01:21:00,400
<i>Here is Muhammad</i>

1128

<i>he's wearing green trunks.</i>

Who's that laughing with Cattano?

1133
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:15,100
How'd he get
so fuckin close to the ring?

1134
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:16,500
<i>The heavyweight</i>

1135

<i>Joe Frazier!</i>

You gonna keep that hat on all night?
I'll miss the fight.

1138
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:29,800
You paid for it.

1139
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:35,400
Joe, over here!

1140
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:17,800
<i>This guy's a supplier at most,
or just a pimp.</i>

1141
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:20,700
<i>- Otherwise we'd know about him.
- His tickets were phenomenal.</i>

1142
01:22:20,900 --> 01:22:22,800
Better seats than Dominic Cattano.

1143
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:25,000
Joe Louis shook his hand.

1144
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:28,200
Who the fuck is this guy?

1145
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:33,400
What's this?

1146
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:35,900
That's the plate of the limo.

1147
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:38,300
Check with the company
who rented it.

1148
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:43,700
Right there, Mr. Lucas!
Right there.

1149

Picture here!

1150
01:22:48,700 --> 01:22:50,200
Looking good, Frank!

1151
01:22:55,700 --> 01:22:57,300
Congratulations!

1152
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
She's the most beautiful bride
I've ever seen.

1153
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:07,100
That's my sunshine right there,
Mr. Williams.

1154
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:09,100
I wish Bumpy could’ve met her.

1155
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:16,300
Get a picture.

1156
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:27,700
Now come here, baby.

1157
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,800
- What's happening?
- Sit tight.

1158
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:57,800
Congratulations, Frank.

1159
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,100
Detective.

1160
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:03,000
You're sure you did the right thing?
I mean, she's a beautiful

1161
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:05,700
- girl and all. Don't get me wrong.
- Hey, listen.

1162
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:08,800
Before you say anything
about me or my wife,

1163
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:11,000
understand this is
the most important day of my life.

1164
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:13,100
I understand,

1165
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:15,900
a man walks around in a $50,000
chinchilla coat

1166
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
and never even bought me
a cup of coffee...

1167
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:20,000
there's something wrong there.

1168
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:22,000
You pay your bills, Frank?

1169
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:24,800
- Don't know what you're sayin.
- Pay your bills?

1170
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,800
If you're not getting your share,
you should go talk to your chief.

1171
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:31,000
What's my share?
Cause you don't fuckin know me.

1172
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,700
- Maybe I am special.
- You are special.

1173
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:37,000
Do you see that right there?

1174
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:39,800
Special Investigations Unit.

1175
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:41,700
Special.

1176
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:43,800
Get it?

1177
01:24:44,900 --> 01:24:47,300
Ten grand, first of each month,

1179
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:52,000
- Are you done?
- Yeah, I'm done.

1180
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:58,200
Don't forget your card.
Have a fuckin nice honeymoon.

1181
01:24:58,500 --> 01:24:59,500
Let's go.

1182

<i>His name is Frank Lucas,</i>

1183
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:04,200
originally from Greensboro,
North Carolina.

1184
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:09,100
Couple of arrests years ago,
gambling and unlicensed firearm.

1185
01:26:09,700 --> 01:26:12,100
For fifteen years,
he was Bumpy Johnson's driver.

1186
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:14,200
Bodyguard and collector.

1187
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:17,400
He was with him when he died.

1188
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:19,200
He's got five brothers.

1189
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:20,800
He's the oldest.

1190
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:22,900
And a lot of cousins.

1191
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:24,900
They all live up here now,

1192
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:26,900
spread throughout
the five boroughs in Jersey.

1193
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:29,400
The brothers are Dexter,

1194
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:32,300
<i>- What can I do for you?
- In Brooklyn, a dry cleaner.</i>

1195
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:33,400
Picking up.

1196
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:38,500
<i>Melvin in Queens has a custom
furniture and fire door business.</i>

1197
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:42,100

<i>Turner in the Bronx has a tire shop.</i>

1200
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:52,700
<i>And Huey Lucas in Bergen County
has a body shop.</i>

1201
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,200
Is there a manager here?

1202
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:56,400
- That's my price.
- I'll take it somewhere else.

1203
01:26:56,700 --> 01:26:59,900
<i>These businesses are the distribution
and collection points</i>

1204
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:02,500
<i>for Frank's dope,
and Frank's money.</i>

1205
01:27:03,100 --> 01:27:06,200
Everything about Frank's life
seems unpretentious,

1206
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:08,500
<i>orderly and legitimate.</i>

1207
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:11,100

<i>Takes a meeting with the accountant,
or his lawyer.</i>

1211
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,400
<i>At night, he usually stays at home,</i>

1212
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:23,800
<i>and if he does go out,</i>

1213
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,900
<i>it's to one of two clubs, or a handful
of restaurants with his new wife.</i>

1214
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:30,300
<i>Ball players, friends</i>

1215
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:33,500
<i>musicians, never, never,
organized crime guys.</i>

1216
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,600
<i>Sundays,
he takes his mother to church.</i>

1217
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:39,600
<i>Then he drives out
and he changes the flowers</i>

1218
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:43,000
on Bumpy's grave.
Every Sunday no matter what.

1219
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,400
<i>Not your typical day in the life</i>

1220
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:46,900
<i>of a dope man, Richie.</i>

1221
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:51,100
<i>Bumpy's life wasn't typical either,
and he ran Harlem for years.</i>

1222
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:55,300
<i>You're saying that Frank Lucas
replaced Bumpy Johnson?</i>

1223
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:57,300
<i>- Yeah.
- His driver?</i>

1224
01:27:58,100 --> 01:27:59,800
Sounds a little far-fetched.

1225
01:28:00,100 --> 01:28:02,700
<i>But is it?
Because everything he does...</i>

1226
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:04,000
<i>Handing out turkeys.</i>

1227
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:06,400
<i>He does the same
as Bumpy would've done.</i>

1228
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:08,300
<i>Who was Bumpy most likely to teach?</i>

1229
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:11,100
The guy he sees every day.

1230
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,800
<i>It's like a Sicilian family.</i>

1231
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:16,400
He structured his organization

1232
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:18,200
to protect him in the same way.

1233
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:19,900
And if he was with Bumpy for so long,

1234
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:22,500
that means he would've spent
a lot of time with Italians,

1235
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:24,900
definitively long enough
to learn that much.

1236
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:27,000
But here's the thing.

1237
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:29,700
I don't think it's Frank Lucas
we're after.

1238
01:28:29,900 --> 01:28:32,700
Who we want
is whoever Lucas is working for.

1239
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,900
Whoever is bringing the heroin in.

1240
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:36,100
Okay.

1241
01:28:37,100 --> 01:28:40,500
So, what do you have on him
that'll stick in court?

1242
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:42,200
Because this isn't it.

1243
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:45,300
Without powder,
without informants,

1244
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:47,300
no one's going to jail.

1245
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:49,800
That's understood, Sir,
I don't think we'll get

1246
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:52,100
informants,
not from inside the family.

1247
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:55,000
Unless we get very, very lucky.

1248
01:29:03,700 --> 01:29:04,900
That's it down there.

1249
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:52,600
Let's all join hands.

1250
01:29:56,700 --> 01:29:58,500
Lord, we thank you for this food

1251
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:01,300
we're about to receive
the nourishment of our bodies.

1252
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:03,500
Fill our souls with heavenly grace,

1253
01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:06,000
in Jesus' name, and for his sake.

1254
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:08,200
- Amen.
- Amen!

1255
01:30:29,300 --> 01:30:30,400
It's OK.

1256
01:30:31,100 --> 01:30:32,200
Come on.

1257
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:34,500
It's OK.

1258
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:38,600
- Better ready yourself.
- C'mon, big man, throw the ball.

1259
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:40,800
- C'mon.
- Get yourself ready, ol' man.

1260
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:43,300
C'mon, now.

1261
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:45,100
C'mon, now.

1262
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:47,600
I'm going to set your ass
in the grass, Uncle Melvin.

1263
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:50,200
Watch your mouth, boy,
and throw the ball.

1264
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:53,000
Damn, Uncle Melvin,
I gonna pitch that out field.

1265
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:55,300
Come here.

1266
01:30:56,700 --> 01:30:57,900
Sit down.

1267
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,100
Uncle Frank.

1268
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:00,700
What's happenin?

1269
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,000
How you doin?

1270
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:03,400
Cool.

1271
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:04,700
Want a drink?

1272
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
- You know better than that.
- Just checking.

1273
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:12,600
Why didn't you show up
for that meeting?

1274
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:16,800
I set it up with the Yankees
and Billy Martin.

1275
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:21,000
Why didn't you show up?

1276
01:31:23,900 --> 01:31:25,000
Don't lie to me.

1277
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
I don't want to play ball no more.

1278
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,900
- I decided.
- What you mean, decided what?

1279
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:34,300
- I don't want it.
- What you talkin about?

1280
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:35,900
You play since you was little,

1281
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,800
you're ready for the pros,
what do you...

1282
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,200
We got a problem.

1283
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:44,600
What do you want?

1284
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:48,400
I want what you got, Uncle Frank.

1285
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:50,200
I want to be you.

1286
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:35,400
My man!

1287
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:39,400
- Welcome, Frank.
- How you doin, Nick?

1288
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:41,400
It's all great, welcome.

1289
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:44,500
- I need to talk to you.
- Right, c'mon.

1290
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:49,600
Yeah, everybody's good,
everybody's happy,

1291
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:52,300
Charlie, Baz, the Italians,
johnny law,

1292
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:54,100
everybody's happy except you.

1293
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:56,900
I don't get why you have
to take something that's

1294
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:58,400
perfectly good,

1295
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:00,300
and mess it up.

1296
01:33:01,100 --> 01:33:02,200
See, brand name,

1297
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:04,500
brand name means something,
you understand?

1298
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:06,000
Shut the fuck up!

1299
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:09,400
Go ahead.
Sorry about that bullshit.

1300
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:11,700
Blue Magic.

1301
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:13,800
That's a brand name.

1302
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Like Pepsi, that's a brand name.

1303
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:18,600
I stand behind it, I guarantee it.

1304
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,700
They know that even if
they don't know me

1305
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,800
any more than
the chairman of General Mills.

1306
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:27,100
- What the fuck you talkin about?
- What I'm talking about is when you

1307
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:30,000
chop my dope down
to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 %,

1308
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:32,500
and then call it
Blue Magic,

1309
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:35,700
that's trademark infringement,
understand?

1310
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:39,000
With all due respect,
if I buy something I own it.

1311
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:40,300
That ain't true.

1312
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:42,800
I buy a car,
I can paint the motherfucker.

1313
01:33:42,900 --> 01:33:45,200
But you don't have to,
that's what I'm saying to you,

1314
01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:47,900
it's good enough the way it is.
You can make enough money of it

1315
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:50,000
the way it is
just by calling it Blue Magic.

1316
01:33:50,100 --> 01:33:51,700
More than that is greed, son!

1317
01:33:51,900 --> 01:33:53,800
What you want?
That I change the name?

1318
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
I'd have to insist
that you change the name.

1319
01:33:56,300 --> 01:33:57,300
Fine by me,

1320
01:33:57,500 --> 01:33:58,700
I'll call it Red Magic.

1321
01:33:58,900 --> 01:34:01,100
- Even if it don't sound as good.
- Name it what you want.

1322
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:02,900
Put a choker on it, motherfucker,

1323
01:34:03,100 --> 01:34:05,600
and call it Blue Dogshit,
know what I mean?

1324
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:07,900
Just don't let me
catch you doing this again.

1325
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:12,500
"Catch me",
"infringement", "insist" ?

1326
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,500
I don't like these words
as much as "please",

1327
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:17,600
"thank you, sorry to bother you Nicky,"

1328
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:20,800
these are better words to use
when you come to my club uninvited.

1329
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Hear me?

1330
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:24,600
My man.

1331
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:34,300
Shit.

1332
01:34:35,100 --> 01:34:36,500
Fuck, is that cops there?

1333
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:46,600
It's all right.

1334
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:50,200
What the hell they gonna do,
give us a ticket?

1335
01:34:51,100 --> 01:34:52,800
Stuff's in the car, Frank.

1336
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:57,600
- What?
- Some of it is in the trunk.

1337
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:03,100
- How you doin, Frank?
- Good, how was your Thanksgiving?

1338
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:06,100
Not so good as a matter of fact.
Get out of the car.

1339
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:13,900
- Give me the keys.
- Where's the Shelby at?

1340
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:16,400
It's gone. Stay right there.

1341
01:35:16,700 --> 01:35:18,000
Yes, sir, right here.

1342
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:21,200
Got anything worth lookin at?

1343
01:35:21,700 --> 01:35:23,000
That's the Trupo guy.

1344
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:24,700
- Is that him?
- Yeah.

1345
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:26,300
Fuckin prick.

1346
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:31,100
Come here a minute, Frank.

1347
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:35,200
What we gonna do about this?

1348
01:35:35,700 --> 01:35:38,700
Nothing, close it up, throw it back in,
everybody go home.

1349
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:40,700
Have some pumpkin pie,
warm apple cider.

1350
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,600
I got a better idea.

1351
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:46,100
Or would you rather me
throw you and your bro in the river?

1352
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,200
Or would you rather
your house blows up next time?

1353
01:35:54,700 --> 01:35:56,600
- I loved that car.
- I know.

1354
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:01,300
What's he doin?

1355
01:36:01,700 --> 01:36:02,900
Shakedown.

1356
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:06,100
Somebody's getting some money
for the benevolent funk.

1357
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:08,800
Sorry, Frank.

1358
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,400
Go on, get in the car.

1359
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:36,400
All right, you call me back.

1360
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:40,200
INS, IRS, FBI,

1361
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:42,300
can't get a damn thing out of them.

1362
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:44,700
Cause they all think
you're on the take.

1363
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:47,200
And you think they are.

1364
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:50,100
I don't think they want this to stop.

1365
01:36:51,100 --> 01:36:52,800
He employs too many people.

1366
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:57,300
Judges, lawyers, cops,
politicians, prison guards,

1367
01:36:57,800 --> 01:36:59,300
probation officers.

1368
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:03,900
His dope stops flowing in, a hundred
thousand people lose their job.

1369
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:17,800
What the fuck is a microwave?

1370
01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:21,300
It's a scientific force,
like atomic energy.

1371
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:25,400
It rearranges the molecules.

1372
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:27,300
- Of what?
- Of what...

1373
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:28,600
Of popcorn.

1374
01:37:31,300 --> 01:37:33,800
Of your head.
Stick it in, go on.

1375
01:37:37,100 --> 01:37:38,800
I can get you one of those.

1376
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:40,700
Brand new, just like this.

1377
01:37:41,100 --> 01:37:42,500
I'll have it delivered.

1378
01:37:42,900 --> 01:37:44,100
No, thank you.

1379
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:58,500
- Where is that?
- Aspen, we just got back.

1380
01:37:58,700 --> 01:38:01,100
- Great time. You know who we met?
- Who?

1381
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:03,800
Burt Reynolds.

1382
01:38:06,700 --> 01:38:07,800
I'm not kidding.

1383
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:11,600
Hollywood people go up there,
they're buying up everything.

1384
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:13,700
This is your place?

1385
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:15,200
You know what it’s worth?

1386
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:17,800
Ski in, ski out,
five bedrooms,

1387
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,400
sauna, everything.

1388
01:38:19,900 --> 01:38:21,200
We were guests.

1389
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:27,200
It's your place.

1390
01:38:42,700 --> 01:38:44,700
Isn’t there something we can do

1391
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,500
about leaving the big guy alone?

1392
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,400
You know what I mean.

1393
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:55,400
I don’t report what you just said,
then I can get in a lot of trouble.

1394
01:38:55,700 --> 01:38:57,700
I do report it,
and the trouble is yours.

1395
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:02,200
Hoping you won't do that.

1396
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:05,700
C'mon, I am not taping it.

1397
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:08,700
How do you know?
Because we're friends.

1398
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:12,700
- I'm telling you, this is a real offer.
- From who?

1399
01:39:13,300 --> 01:39:14,400
Your uncle?

1400
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:20,200
Why would you do this?
Why risk our friendship?

1401
01:39:20,500 --> 01:39:21,700
Because...

1402
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,800
I care what happens to you.

1403
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:29,900
You shouldn’t have done it.

1404
01:39:30,700 --> 01:39:33,600
I had too, I had no choice,
neither do you, Richie!

1405
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:36,300
You don't have a choice!
Just leave

1406
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:38,300
Frank Lucas alone!

1407
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:40,900
Frank Lucas?

1408
01:39:46,300 --> 01:39:48,500
Tell Maria I had to leave,
I'm sorry.

1409
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:51,000
Tell her why.

1410
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:35,600
- Talk!
- Don't shoot!

1411
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:37,700
- Are you Richie Roberts?
- Yes, so what?

1412
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,800
It's been served.
Sorry.

1413
01:41:00,700 --> 01:41:01,700
Laurie.

1414
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:06,700
I'm sorry I never gave you
the kind of life you wanted.

1415
01:41:07,700 --> 01:41:09,600
I'm sorry it was never enough.

1416
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:15,200
Don't punish me for being honest.

1417
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,600
Don't take my boy away.

1418
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:21,700
What? Are you saying...

1419
01:41:22,100 --> 01:41:23,600
that because you were honest

1420
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:26,200
and didn't take money
like every other cop, I left you?

1421
01:41:26,900 --> 01:41:28,200
No, you don't take money

1422
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:29,600
for one reason.

1423
01:41:29,700 --> 01:41:32,400
To buy being dishonest
about everything else.

1424
01:41:32,900 --> 01:41:35,200
It's worse than taking money
nobody gives a shit about!

1425
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:38,100
Drug money, gambling money
nobody's gonna miss.

1426
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:41,600
I'd rather you took it
and been honest with me!

1427
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,700
Or don't take it, I don't care,
but don't go cheating on me!

1428
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:46,900
Or on your kid
by never being around.

1429
01:41:47,100 --> 01:41:48,900
Don't go out and get laid
by your snitches,

1430
01:41:49,100 --> 01:41:50,900
and your secretaries and strippers!

1431
01:41:51,100 --> 01:41:53,400
I can tell by just looking
she's one of'em.

1432
01:41:55,200 --> 01:41:57,800
You think you're going to Heaven
cause you're honest.

1433
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,100
But you're not!

1434
01:41:59,900 --> 01:42:03,100
You're going to the same hell
as the crooked cops you can't stand!

1435
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:05,000
All rise!

1436
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:11,300
Please, be seated.

1437
01:42:12,900 --> 01:42:14,100
Ms. Dickerson.

1438
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:17,000
Before the court renders its opinion,

1439
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:19,900
is there anything else
you'll like to be heard on?

1440
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:21,500
Yes, your honor.

1441
01:42:22,100 --> 01:42:24,300
Your Honor, a lot has been said here
today about

1442
01:42:24,500 --> 01:42:27,300
how unsavory Mr. Roberts’
environment is for a child.

1443
01:42:27,700 --> 01:42:29,200
How dangerous it is.

1444
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:31,100
We tell him to protects us.

1445
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:33,300
We give him that responsability
but then

1446
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:35,800
say "Oh, we don’t trust you
to raise a child."

1447
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:38,600
- "We don't think you're fit for that."
- I'm not.

1448
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:41,000
You're right.

1449
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:44,700
Being around me
is no place for a kid.

1450
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:48,200
You take him to Vegas.
I'll come see him when I can.

1451
01:42:51,300 --> 01:42:54,300
Your Honor, I want to apologize
for wasting the court's time.

1452
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:07,900
Doc.

1453
01:43:08,700 --> 01:43:09,800
I see him.

1454
01:43:10,300 --> 01:43:11,400
Here he is.

1455
01:43:30,300 --> 01:43:31,500
What's going on?

1456
01:43:33,400 --> 01:43:34,500
Champagne?

1457
01:43:34,700 --> 01:43:36,400
- Merry Xmas, detectives!
- For us?

1458
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:37,700
Yeah, enjoy that.

1459
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:40,100
Fellas, have a good time.

1460
01:43:42,300 --> 01:43:43,400
Good stuff.

1461
01:43:47,500 --> 01:43:49,800
<i>The South Vietnamese troops
conducted airstrikes</i>

1462
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,300
<i>on communist positions inside the city.</i>

1463
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:56,900
Paying all of johnny law,
that's one thing.

1464
01:43:57,300 --> 01:43:59,200
I got no problem with that,
I've been...

1465
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:01,700
paying off the police since I was ten,

1466
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:04,500
putting more of their kids to college
than the National Merit Award.

1467
01:44:04,600 --> 01:44:06,000
Give me one of them rounded.

1468
01:44:06,300 --> 01:44:07,900
This is different though.

1469
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:10,900
This Special Investigative Unit,
that's their problem,

1470
01:44:11,100 --> 01:44:13,700
- they think they're special.
- Fucking crooks.

1471
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,100
- No code of ethics.
- What do you think?

1472
01:44:16,300 --> 01:44:18,000
Looks great. It's beautiful.

1473
01:44:18,900 --> 01:44:19,900
Good.

1474
01:44:20,600 --> 01:44:22,600
The police, that's not what
I'm worrying about.

1475
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:24,900
I'm seeing cars
where I never seen 'em before.

1476
01:44:25,100 --> 01:44:27,300
- People I don't know.
- Yeah, me too.

1477
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:33,300
- Merry Xmas, Charlie.
- Thank you.

1478
01:44:33,700 --> 01:44:35,500
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1479
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:38,700
Take this.

1480
01:44:39,700 --> 01:44:41,200
A quick toast and I'll be off.

1481
01:44:48,900 --> 01:44:51,600
- We're gonna have a great time.
- That's right, chica.

1482
01:44:51,700 --> 01:44:53,900
Mr. Lucas.
Enjoy your evening.

1483
01:44:55,300 --> 01:44:56,400
It's all clear.

1484
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,300
<i>- Who is that?
-  It's Nicky. You see him?</i>

1485
01:45:04,600 --> 01:45:05,800
Yeah, I see him.

1486
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:07,600
Just keep going.

1487
01:45:08,300 --> 01:45:09,800
- Around back?
- Hell, no,

1488
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,900
I ain't sneaking in my own club.

1489
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:14,200
Incredible.

1490
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:16,300
<i>Increhible.</i>

1491
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Come on.

1492
01:45:41,500 --> 01:45:42,600
Hold on.

1493
01:45:50,900 --> 01:45:51,900
What?

1494
01:45:52,100 --> 01:45:53,700
I want to wait in the car.

1495
01:45:53,900 --> 01:45:55,700
I got it, I'll wait for this.

1496
01:45:57,500 --> 01:45:59,500
- Get that yellow sauce.
- Yellow sauce.

1497
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:01,700
And the chicken,
the Kung Pao chicken.

1498
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:09,200
Can you turn the heater on?

1499
01:46:15,900 --> 01:46:18,000
Shit.
I'm gonna go get the keys.

1500
01:46:32,100 --> 01:46:34,100
- Doc, give me the key.
- Here you go.

1501
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:41,500
Doc!

1502
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:46,800
Get out!

1503
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,000
You're okay?

1504
01:46:56,100 --> 01:46:57,100
Shit!

1505
01:46:57,600 --> 01:46:59,500
- Come on.
- Are you all right?

1506
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:02,500
Let's go.

1507
01:47:23,500 --> 01:47:24,700
Was it Nicky?

1508
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:28,900
We'll go right now fuckin kill him
whether it was or not,

1509
01:47:29,100 --> 01:47:30,700
you say the word, Frankie.

1510
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:34,100
We got to do something.

1511
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:37,400
- We can't just sit here.
- We're leaving.

1512
01:47:40,900 --> 01:47:42,500
- Everybody, get out.
- You all right?

1513
01:47:42,700 --> 01:47:45,600
Go on home. It's Xmas time,
you gotta be with your family.

1514
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:48,200
Go on, be with your kids.

1515
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,700
Where we gonna go?
Spain? Somewhere in China?

1516
01:48:06,500 --> 01:48:08,600
Sit down,
tell me where you want to go.

1517
01:48:11,300 --> 01:48:13,400
We can go anywhere we want.

1518
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:15,100
- We can live anywhere.
- Where?

1519
01:48:15,300 --> 01:48:16,700
And do what? Run? Hide?

1520
01:48:16,900 --> 01:48:19,200
Frank Lucas don't run
from nobody, baby.

1521
01:48:19,900 --> 01:48:23,500
We ain't going nowhere,
we stay here, this is my home.

1522
01:48:24,200 --> 01:48:26,600
This is where my business is,
my wife, my mother,

1523
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,900
my family, my country.
I ain't going nowhere.

1524
01:48:30,900 --> 01:48:32,600
I am running from nobody.

1525
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:35,700
This is America.

1526
01:48:42,900 --> 01:48:44,900
And you ain't going away either.

1527
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,100
<i>A ceasefire,
internationally supervised,</i>

1528
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:55,400
<i>will begin at 7 pm</i>

1529
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:57,900
<i>this Saturday, January 27,
Washington time.</i>

1530
01:48:58,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Call you back.

1531
01:48:59,100 --> 01:49:01,000
<i>Within 60 days from this saturday...</i>

1532
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:03,000
What are you doing?

1533
01:49:13,300 --> 01:49:14,100
So...

1534
01:49:14,700 --> 01:49:17,700
From what I hear, a Corsican mob
took a shot at Frank.

1535
01:49:18,100 --> 01:49:20,100
The French Connection, Fernando Rey,

1536
01:49:20,300 --> 01:49:22,600
the exporters
that Frank has put out of business.

1537
01:49:23,800 --> 01:49:25,700
I can take care of him in New York.

1538
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:29,300
I just don’t want to worry every time
he drives across the bridge to Jersey

1539
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:31,200
someone’s gonna take
another shot at him.

1540
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:35,700
You and I gotta start
working together.

1541
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:37,900
We need to step up our efforts.

1542
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:40,700
Next time, their aim could be better.

1543
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,300
We need to keep this cash cow alive.

1544
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:52,200
What the fuck you're doing here?

1545
01:49:57,700 --> 01:50:00,000
You actually gonna arrest Frank Lucas?

1546
01:50:00,500 --> 01:50:02,900
- What's the matter with you?
- What, you don't know?

1547
01:50:04,900 --> 01:50:06,900
Everybody in New Jersey is crazy.

1548
01:50:08,100 --> 01:50:09,500
You know what we do here?

1549
01:50:09,700 --> 01:50:11,800
Cops arrest bad guys.

1550
01:50:13,600 --> 01:50:15,500
Before you get on that bridge again,

1551
01:50:15,700 --> 01:50:17,200
you should call me first.

1552
01:50:18,300 --> 01:50:19,600
To make sure it's safe.

1553
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:26,000
"I'm gonna enlighten some of my friends,
I can guarantee you peace of mind."

1554
01:50:26,200 --> 01:50:27,800
That's what you told me, Dominic.

1555
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:31,600
"I can guarantee you peace of mind!"

1556
01:50:32,300 --> 01:50:33,900
I don't feel so peaceful!

1557
01:50:39,400 --> 01:50:41,600
They tried to kill my wife!

1558
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Who was that?

1559
01:50:49,800 --> 01:50:51,400
Maybe one of your people.

1560
01:50:52,200 --> 01:50:54,000
- I don't know yet.
- You don't?

1561
01:50:54,600 --> 01:50:55,800
You don't know.

1562
01:50:57,500 --> 01:50:59,500
I'll tell you what I know,
maybe I should just...

1563
01:50:59,900 --> 01:51:01,600
put 500 guns out there on the street,

1564
01:51:01,700 --> 01:51:03,600
start shooting up people
just to make a point.

1565
01:51:03,700 --> 01:51:06,000
It was a junkie,
or it was a rival.

1566
01:51:06,500 --> 01:51:08,800
Some dumb ass kid
trying to make a name for himself.

1567
01:51:09,100 --> 01:51:10,600
Someone you forgot to pay off.

1568
01:51:11,100 --> 01:51:13,200
Someone you slighted
without even realizing it.

1569
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:16,000
Could be someone
you put out of business.

1570
01:51:16,300 --> 01:51:18,500
For being so successful.
Look at you!

1571
01:51:19,200 --> 01:51:20,300
Success,

1572
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:23,500
it's got enemies.
Lots of enemies.

1573
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:26,300
The success took a shot at you.

1574
01:51:26,600 --> 01:51:28,200
What you gonna do?
Kill it?

1575
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:30,200
You gonna become unsuccessful?

1576
01:51:31,800 --> 01:51:34,400
We can be successful
and have enemies, right?

1577
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:38,100
Or be unsuccessful too,
and have friends.

1578
01:51:39,300 --> 01:51:40,900
That's the choice we make.

1579
01:51:42,900 --> 01:51:46,400
<i>The final evacuation of military
and diplomatic personnel</i>

1580
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:49,500
<i>continued throughout the night
as North Vietnamese troops</i>

1581
01:51:49,800 --> 01:51:52,900
<i>marched on Saigon.
The imminent fall of the city</i>

1582
01:51:53,200 --> 01:51:56,000
<i>has brought chaos
and a growing sense of desperation...</i>

1583
01:52:05,500 --> 01:52:08,400
<i>- Operator.
- Bangkok 367, international.</i>

1584
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:10,400
One moment, please.

1585
01:52:17,600 --> 01:52:18,800
<i>Sawadeekap.</i>

1586
01:52:19,700 --> 01:52:22,000
<i>- Nate.
- Hey Frank, what's up?</i>

1587
01:52:22,300 --> 01:52:23,700
What's going on over there?

1588
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:25,800
<i>- It's all over.
- Yeah, I'm watchin the news.</i>

1589
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,800
<i>- What the hell's going on?
- The game's over, Frank.</i>

1590
01:52:29,400 --> 01:52:32,100
It's done. Everybody going home baby.
Give peace a chance.

1591
01:52:32,300 --> 01:52:35,300
Well now, I'm not... Listen to me.
I want two thou'.

1592
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:39,000
I want 2,000 kis in the air.

1593
01:52:39,200 --> 01:52:40,800
<i>It's impossible, Frank.</i>

1594
01:52:41,100 --> 01:52:44,300
<i>- All our resources are going home.
- Tell you what. I'm on my way there.</i>

1595
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:45,800
<i>- Right now?
- Yeah.</i>

1596
01:52:55,900 --> 01:52:57,400
Spear, wake the fuck up!

1597
01:52:57,700 --> 01:52:58,700
What?

1598
01:53:00,400 --> 01:53:03,400
- Where do you think you're goin?
- Don't hurt me, Jimmy!

1599
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:07,100
- Jesus, fuck!
- Police!

1600
01:53:07,500 --> 01:53:09,400
- Drop the gun, Jimmy!
- Drop it!

1601
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:11,800
- Let me see your hands!
- Drop the fuckin gun!

1602
01:53:11,900 --> 01:53:14,600
I'm not playing,
I'll blast your fuckin head!

1603
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:16,100
Don't shoot!

1604
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,200
I got your gun,

1605
01:53:19,800 --> 01:53:21,300
and I got your prints.

1606
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:23,800
You know what you got?

1607
01:53:24,500 --> 01:53:25,800
You got attempted murder.

1608
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:28,500
Eighteen fucking years!

1609
01:53:29,100 --> 01:53:32,100
Attempted murder is the same as murder,
that’s Grand Jury.

1610
01:53:32,500 --> 01:53:34,800
Now the Grand Jury
could come back favorably.

1611
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,600
It could be reduced to manslaughter.

1612
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:40,200
Maybe even self defense.

1613
01:53:40,500 --> 01:53:42,200
Depends on how we want
to deal with you.

1614
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:44,100
You see where this is fucking going?

1615
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:45,600
Let’s say you beat it.

1616
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:48,000
What do you think
your cousin Frank’ll think?

1617
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:50,400
He'll know that at some point in time,

1618
01:53:50,600 --> 01:53:52,800
we sat you down
and talked to you like this.

1619
01:53:53,100 --> 01:53:55,400
And then you go to court
and you beat attempted murder?

1620
01:53:55,800 --> 01:53:57,800
What he's gonna think?
Is he stupid?

1621
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,600
- Is your cousin Frank stupid?
- Answer him!

1622
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:04,000
No, he's gonna assume that you talked.

1623
01:54:07,300 --> 01:54:09,300
But right now, Frank doesn't know.

1624
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,100
You want Frank
to read this in the papers?

1625
01:54:12,300 --> 01:54:14,100
Or you just wanna walk out of here?

1626
01:54:14,300 --> 01:54:16,000
No bail, no trial,

1627
01:54:16,200 --> 01:54:18,200
no jail,
just walk out of here today.

1628
01:54:19,200 --> 01:54:20,400
Your choice.

1629
01:54:30,800 --> 01:54:33,300
Opium plants are hearty enough

1630
01:54:33,500 --> 01:54:35,400
to outlive any war.

1631
01:54:36,300 --> 01:54:39,900
They’ll still be here
long after the troops are gone.

1632
01:54:41,700 --> 01:54:43,800
What are you going to do
for transportation

1633
01:54:44,100 --> 01:54:46,300
when the last US plane goes home?

1634
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:48,500
I'll figure something out.

1635
01:54:50,600 --> 01:54:52,800
You’ll see me again,
that's for sure.

1636
01:54:54,600 --> 01:54:57,300
It’s not in my best interest
to say this, Frank...

1637
01:54:58,100 --> 01:55:00,600
but quitting while you’re ahead

1638
01:55:01,700 --> 01:55:03,400
is not the same as quitting.

1639
01:55:47,100 --> 01:55:48,000
Go get him.

1640
01:55:51,200 --> 01:55:53,200
- Whenever you want to, baby.
- A second.

1641
01:55:53,700 --> 01:55:54,700
It's Frank.

1642
01:55:58,900 --> 01:56:00,000
Newark.

1643
01:56:01,100 --> 01:56:02,300
short-term

1644
01:56:03,300 --> 01:56:04,800
parking lot 3.

1645
01:56:05,700 --> 01:56:06,900
Short-term lot 3.

1646
01:56:07,400 --> 01:56:09,000
It is the Mustang, right?

1647
01:56:09,300 --> 01:56:10,600
OK, what's the plate number?

1648
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,000
K

1649
01:56:12,200 --> 01:56:13,300
- A.
- KA.

1650
01:56:13,500 --> 01:56:14,800
<i>76</i>

1651
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,100
<i>0</i>

1652
01:56:16,400 --> 01:56:17,400
<i>All right.</i>

1653
01:56:18,700 --> 01:56:20,600
There's no short-term lot 3 in Newark.

1654
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:23,000
- They got letters, A, B,C, D.
- I know!

1655
01:56:23,300 --> 01:56:25,100
Maybe he means a time, 3 o'clock?

1656
01:56:25,500 --> 01:56:27,300
This is no Jersey plate.

1657
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:29,900
Nor a New York one.

1658
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:32,900
KA 760.

1659
01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:35,500
Kilo Alpha?

1660
01:56:36,600 --> 01:56:37,900
A plane tail number?

1661
01:56:38,600 --> 01:56:40,000
Kilo Alpha 760.

1662
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:44,300
You check commercial planes,
you guys private planes.

1663
01:56:44,600 --> 01:56:46,000
Everything, from a little Cessna

1664
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:48,100
to the biggest fuckin jet, alright?

1665
01:56:48,400 --> 01:56:50,800
Check the miltary planes.
Where you going? Stay there.

1666
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:52,200
Sit down!

1667
01:57:15,500 --> 01:57:16,600
Captain?

1668
01:57:17,300 --> 01:57:19,500
Richie Roberts, Essex County.

1669
01:57:19,900 --> 01:57:21,400
I know you're expecting us.

1670
01:57:21,700 --> 01:57:22,800
Here's our warrant.

1671
01:57:23,100 --> 01:57:24,500
We're looking on the plane.

1672
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:26,700
- Wait.
- Scotty, stop all these soldiers,

1673
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:28,600
check their bags, everyone of'em.

1674
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:40,700
No knock, warrant.

1675
01:57:41,800 --> 01:57:43,300
Go ahead, start upstairs.

1676
01:57:43,600 --> 01:57:45,500
- Where are they going?
- Step this way.

1677
01:57:46,500 --> 01:57:47,800
M'am, please sit down.

1678
01:57:48,100 --> 01:57:49,200
What is this?

1679
01:57:51,100 --> 01:57:52,300
Hold it! Stop!

1680
01:57:53,700 --> 01:57:56,500
Nothing leaves this area, all right?
Slow down with this.

1681
01:57:57,100 --> 01:57:59,100
- Stop these trucks.
- Hold on.

1682
01:57:59,300 --> 01:58:01,100
Everything off the walls,
pull it all down.

1683
01:58:01,300 --> 01:58:02,400
That thing's a monster.

1684
01:58:02,600 --> 01:58:04,800
- What is this?
- Nothing goes out til we've checked it.

1685
01:58:04,900 --> 01:58:06,300
All right, Captain? Nothing.

1686
01:58:06,500 --> 01:58:08,600
We're gonna take the plane down,
look at the trucks.

1687
01:58:08,700 --> 01:58:11,300
Every man here gets searched.
Read the warrant, Sir.

1688
01:58:12,400 --> 01:58:14,800
Your husband’s
illustrious career is over.

1689
01:58:15,900 --> 01:58:18,900
The Feds are going to come in
and take everything.

1690
01:58:19,300 --> 01:58:20,700
They gonna take it all.

1691
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:22,900
But not before I get my gratuity.

1692
01:58:24,300 --> 01:58:25,500
So, where’s the money?

1693
01:58:25,700 --> 01:58:27,000
What money?

1694
01:58:27,400 --> 01:58:28,700
What money, you ask?

1695
01:58:29,200 --> 01:58:30,300
The getaway money

1696
01:58:30,500 --> 01:58:33,200
that Frank and every other gangster
keeps in his house.

1697
01:58:33,400 --> 01:58:36,300
If you leave now, there's a chance
Frank might not kill you.

1698
01:58:38,500 --> 01:58:39,800
Shut up! Sit down!

1699
01:58:40,200 --> 01:58:41,300
Sit down!

1700
01:59:23,700 --> 01:59:27,800
<i>...plan the evacuation of all remaining
US combat forces from Vietnam.</i>

1701
01:59:28,200 --> 01:59:30,600
<i>News that come too late for some,</i>

1702
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:33,900
<i>as here on the solemn tarmac
at Dover Air Force Base,</i>

1703
01:59:34,300 --> 01:59:37,700
<i>this C-130 loaded down
with its sorrowful cargo,</i>

1704
01:59:38,100 --> 01:59:40,200
<i>a cargo of America's bravest and best,</i>

1705
01:59:40,300 --> 01:59:42,200
<i>en route to their final resting places.</i>

1706
01:59:57,700 --> 01:59:59,200
You guys, take this coffin down.

1707
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:09,600
- Open it.
- I'm not doing that.

1708
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:18,200
Great barking dog, huh?

1709
02:00:26,300 --> 02:00:27,800
You stop this. Right now!

1710
02:00:28,200 --> 02:00:30,900
My warrant gives me permission
to examine this plane.

1711
02:00:32,500 --> 02:00:33,900
The plane and its cargo.

1712
02:00:34,400 --> 02:00:36,200
But you don't have my permission.

1713
02:00:37,500 --> 02:00:38,900
I don't need it, Captain.

1714
02:00:40,600 --> 02:00:41,900
Easy! Easy!

1715
02:00:45,600 --> 02:00:46,900
Move out of the way.

1716
02:00:53,300 --> 02:00:54,300
Damn!

1717
02:00:59,400 --> 02:01:00,500
That's enough!

1718
02:01:08,300 --> 02:01:10,400
Stay with the coffins.
Don't let'em out of your sight.

1719
02:01:10,600 --> 02:01:11,700
Got it.

1720
02:01:13,800 --> 02:01:15,200
Help me out with this.

1721
02:01:40,100 --> 02:01:42,200
That was a military transport plane.

1722
02:01:42,600 --> 02:01:45,200
If there was heroin onboard,
someone in the military would have

1723
02:01:45,300 --> 02:01:47,800
to be involved, which means
that even as it fights a war

1724
02:01:48,100 --> 02:01:50,200
that's claimed 50,000 American lives,

1725
02:01:50,700 --> 02:01:52,600
the military is smuggling narcotics.

1726
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:55,300
That is how this event today
will be interpreted.

1727
02:01:55,900 --> 02:01:58,700
That someone employed by this Office
believes that the US Army

1728
02:01:58,900 --> 02:02:00,400
is in the drug trafficking business,

1729
02:02:01,400 --> 02:02:03,500
and is trying to prove it
by desecrating the remains

1730
02:02:03,700 --> 02:02:07,500
of young men who've given their lives
in the defense of democracy!

1731
02:02:07,800 --> 02:02:10,000
- There's dope on that plane.
- Shut the fuck up!

1732
02:02:11,400 --> 02:02:12,700
Is it any wonder then,

1733
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:14,500
because of your actions,

1734
02:02:14,900 --> 02:02:17,900
the entire federal narcotics program
is now in jeopardy  of being dismantled

1735
02:02:18,100 --> 02:02:20,200
as completely and enthusiastically

1736
02:02:20,400 --> 02:02:22,200
as that fucking transport plane?

1737
02:02:22,400 --> 02:02:24,700
That’s what you’ve accomplished
Mr. Roberts. Single-handedly.

1738
02:02:24,900 --> 02:02:26,400
I had good information

1739
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:30,300
the target of my investigation
was bringing dope in on that plane.

1740
02:02:30,700 --> 02:02:32,500
- And that target is?
- Frank Lucas.

1741
02:02:32,600 --> 02:02:34,500
- Who?
- His name is Frank Lucas.

1742
02:02:34,900 --> 02:02:37,400
Who's Frank Lucas? Who's he work for?
Which family?

1743
02:02:37,500 --> 02:02:39,100
He's not Italian. He's black.

1744
02:02:42,900 --> 02:02:45,100
Is that supposed to be
some kind of a joke?

1745
02:02:45,800 --> 02:02:48,300
You’re this close to the end
of your career in law enforcement

1746
02:02:48,400 --> 02:02:49,700
and you’re making jokes?

1747
02:02:50,900 --> 02:02:52,500
My investigation indicates

1748
02:02:53,300 --> 02:02:56,200
that Frank Lucas is above the mafia
in the dope business.

1749
02:02:56,800 --> 02:02:59,300
My investigation also
indicates that Frank Lucas

1750
02:02:59,600 --> 02:03:02,500
buys direct from a source
in Southeast Asia,

1751
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:06,000
he cuts out the middlemen,
and uses US military planes

1752
02:03:06,200 --> 02:03:08,800
and personnel to transport pure No. 4

1753
02:03:09,100 --> 02:03:11,200
heroin into the United States,
and he's been doing so,

1754
02:03:11,400 --> 02:03:13,900
on a regular basis, since 1969!

1755
02:03:14,100 --> 02:03:15,900
I have cases against every member

1756
02:03:16,100 --> 02:03:17,800
- of his organization.
- His organization?

1757
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,900
No fucking nigger has accomplished what
the American Mafia hasn’t

1758
02:03:21,100 --> 02:03:22,100
in a hundred years!

1759
02:03:22,300 --> 02:03:23,500
And you'd know that how?

1760
02:03:23,600 --> 02:03:25,500
Cause your head is stuck up
your fuckin ass?

1761
02:03:25,800 --> 02:03:28,000
Lou, do me a favor,
get this fucking kike out of here.

1762
02:03:28,700 --> 02:03:29,700
Kike?

1763
02:03:36,500 --> 02:03:37,700
Make it stick.

1764
02:03:38,600 --> 02:03:41,000
Spearman's with the coffins,
about a quarter mile away.

1765
02:04:12,200 --> 02:04:13,200
Doctor!

1766
02:04:15,400 --> 02:04:16,400
What?

1767
02:04:17,100 --> 02:04:20,000
Fucking Trupo came by the house.
It's bad.

1768
02:04:36,200 --> 02:04:38,200
I need to speak with you
a minute, please.

1769
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:40,500
- Sit down just a minute.
- I have to go.

1770
02:04:41,100 --> 02:04:42,900
Would you come back a little later?

1771
02:04:43,800 --> 02:04:45,200
- Thank you.
- Ma, I gotta go.

1772
02:04:45,400 --> 02:04:48,000
- Just a few words.
- Listen to me, I got...

1773
02:04:48,200 --> 02:04:50,400
Please sit down.
Just a few words.

1774
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:52,800
I've been thinking about some things.

1775
02:04:53,100 --> 02:04:54,700
If you had been a preacher,

1776
02:04:54,900 --> 02:04:56,700
your brothers
would have been preachers.

1777
02:04:57,400 --> 02:05:00,600
If you had been a soldier,
they'd be soldiers, you know that.

1778
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,100
They all came here because of you.

1779
02:05:03,700 --> 02:05:06,000
- You called and they came, right?
- Right.

1780
02:05:06,200 --> 02:05:08,900
That's because they look up to you.

1781
02:05:09,900 --> 02:05:13,800
They always expect you
to know what's best.

1782
02:05:14,400 --> 02:05:15,900
But even they know...

1783
02:05:16,600 --> 02:05:18,100
you don't shoot cops!

1784
02:05:20,600 --> 02:05:21,900
Even I know that.

1785
02:05:23,500 --> 02:05:24,800
- Heaven knows it.
- Right.

1786
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,500
The only one who doesn't
seem to know is you!

1787
02:05:27,600 --> 02:05:29,000
- All right, Ma.
- It's...

1788
02:05:29,100 --> 02:05:30,900
I promise you
I won't shoot anyone.

1789
02:05:31,100 --> 02:05:33,700
I never asked you
where all this came from.

1790
02:05:33,900 --> 02:05:36,300
- cause I didn't want to hear you lie.
- Don't you worry about it.

1791
02:05:36,400 --> 02:05:38,300
- I gotta go.
- Don't lie to me!

1792
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:44,200
Don't do that.

1793
02:05:45,500 --> 02:05:47,100
- Come on.
- Do you want to...

1794
02:05:47,800 --> 02:05:49,300
make things so bad

1795
02:05:49,500 --> 02:05:51,400
for your family
that they'll leave you?

1796
02:05:51,600 --> 02:05:53,400
- Cause they will.
- I understand.

1797
02:05:53,500 --> 02:05:55,600
She will leave

1798
02:05:55,800 --> 02:05:57,200
-  you.
- All right.

1799
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:01,100
I will leave you.

1800
02:06:29,300 --> 02:06:30,900
Coffins on the move, Richie.

1801
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:34,100
We want the transport coffins,
not the ceremonial ones.

1802
02:06:35,500 --> 02:06:36,800
Who are these guys?

1803
02:06:39,400 --> 02:06:40,600
What does it say?

1804
02:06:43,700 --> 02:06:46,700
- Bayo Custodial Services?
- Bayon?

1805
02:06:46,900 --> 02:06:48,400
Bayon Cleaning Services?

1806
02:06:48,700 --> 02:06:50,700
Looks like that.
Get it on camera, Al.

1807
02:06:53,700 --> 02:06:54,700
Bingo.

1808
02:06:55,200 --> 02:06:57,600
Holy shit, that's the baseball kid.

1809
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:01,300
- Oh yeah, that's Stevie Lucas.
- So, what you wanna do?

1810
02:07:01,600 --> 02:07:02,600
Follow the trucks?

1811
02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:04,800
No, I want to stay here
with the Lucas kid.

1812
02:07:05,800 --> 02:07:07,300
We'll follow that van.

1813
02:07:08,100 --> 02:07:10,500
You guys better eat up,
we'll have a long night.

1814
02:07:22,300 --> 02:07:25,400
More precious that gold, man.
This is more precious than gold.

1815
02:07:26,100 --> 02:07:28,300
A couple more, let's go.
Stack that up!

1816
02:07:29,400 --> 02:07:30,400
Take it.

1817
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:32,800
- Take it.
- Give me a second.

1818
02:07:35,200 --> 02:07:38,500
Hey yo, we got four caskets left.
Let's make some money here.

1819
02:07:41,500 --> 02:07:43,900
- They're loading in there.
- What the fuck they're loadin?

1820
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:45,900
- That's the dope.
- That's gotta be it.

1821
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:47,900
That's gotta be.

1822
02:07:48,900 --> 02:07:49,900
Let's go.

1823
02:07:50,800 --> 02:07:51,900
Let's move.

1824
02:08:44,900 --> 02:08:46,100
<i>Lou, it's Richie.</i>

1825
02:08:46,400 --> 02:08:47,800
<i>Get everybody in place.</i>

1826
02:08:48,500 --> 02:08:50,200
<i>- Everybody.
- You're sure this is it?</i>

1827
02:08:50,400 --> 02:08:51,600
I'm positive, OK?

1828
02:08:52,400 --> 02:08:53,800
They're cutting and bagging

1829
02:08:54,100 --> 02:08:56,800
in the south tower of the Stephen Crane
projects right now.

1830
02:08:57,300 --> 02:08:59,500
<i>Are you sure this is it?
You're positive?</i>

1831
02:08:59,800 --> 02:09:02,100
<i>Positive, Lou,
I'm positive, okay?</i>

1832
02:09:02,200 --> 02:09:04,500
<i>Everything's ready to go,
all the guys are ready to go,</i>

1833
02:09:04,700 --> 02:09:07,000
just push the button,
gimme the warrant, okay?

1834
02:09:07,200 --> 02:09:08,700
Okay, you got it.

1835
02:10:10,600 --> 02:10:12,400
- I got the warrant.
- All right.

1836
02:10:16,300 --> 02:10:17,300
Let's go!

1837
02:10:34,400 --> 02:10:35,400
Move.

1838
02:10:38,700 --> 02:10:41,100
- M'am, what's your name?
- What's going on?

1839
02:10:42,500 --> 02:10:44,600
Get down!
Down, motherfucker!

1840
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:48,200
Let's go, Al.

1841
02:10:48,600 --> 02:10:49,700
C'mon.

1842
02:10:51,300 --> 02:10:52,600
C'mon, move it.

1843
02:11:35,400 --> 02:11:36,300
All set.

1844
02:11:37,300 --> 02:11:38,400
Roger.

1845
02:11:41,300 --> 02:11:42,300
Here you go.

1846
02:11:45,200 --> 02:11:46,100
C'mon!

1847
02:11:54,300 --> 02:11:55,300
At target.

1848
02:11:56,300 --> 02:11:58,300
Spearman, stand by.

1849
02:11:58,900 --> 02:12:01,200
<i>I got civilians on the target floor.</i>

1850
02:12:03,900 --> 02:12:04,800
What?

1851
02:12:05,900 --> 02:12:07,100
Fuck, here you go.

1852
02:12:07,700 --> 02:12:09,000
Hey, Tim.

1853
02:12:09,300 --> 02:12:11,300
Girl, put some clothes on.

1854
02:12:11,700 --> 02:12:14,200
You'll catch a cold out here
walking like this.

1855
02:12:20,300 --> 02:12:21,900
What's happenin, Suzie?

1856
02:12:30,600 --> 02:12:31,900
Where you goin?

1857
02:12:32,600 --> 02:12:33,700
Come on.

1858
02:12:35,800 --> 02:12:37,100
I'll get it.

1859
02:12:39,500 --> 02:12:40,800
Where's Tim?

1860
02:12:41,700 --> 02:12:42,800
Quiet, kid.

1861
02:12:49,800 --> 02:12:51,900
Yo, some sandwiches
for the boys, man.

1862
02:12:54,800 --> 02:12:55,900
Where is Tim?

1863
02:12:57,300 --> 02:12:58,700
Tim's always playing around.

1864
02:13:00,100 --> 02:13:01,100
Hey man!

1865
02:13:02,200 --> 02:13:03,900
You got some Blue Magic?

1866
02:13:05,400 --> 02:13:06,700
Fucking junkie.

1867
02:13:07,700 --> 02:13:09,000
Yo, handle that!

1868
02:13:09,400 --> 02:13:11,200
C'mon, I got money, man!

1869
02:13:11,500 --> 02:13:12,500
You know me, baby!

1870
02:13:12,700 --> 02:13:15,400
C'mon, I need that Blue Magic, man!

1871
02:13:15,500 --> 02:13:17,000
It's me, baby!

1872
02:13:17,300 --> 02:13:19,300
You know me, I got money.

1873
02:13:20,300 --> 02:13:22,400
Get outa here.
Fuckin junkie!

1874
02:13:24,200 --> 02:13:25,100
Police!

1875
02:13:26,500 --> 02:13:27,800
- Drop it!
- Get down!

1876
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:29,500
- Drop your gun!
- Don't do it!

1877
02:13:29,600 --> 02:13:31,100
- Drop your gun!
- Don't do it!

1878
02:13:33,500 --> 02:13:34,400
Scotty!

1879
02:13:38,100 --> 02:13:39,500
- Freeze!
- Police!

1880
02:13:42,300 --> 02:13:43,600
Fuck you, motherfucker!

1881
02:13:45,800 --> 02:13:46,900
Nobody moves!

1882
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:48,300
Don't let'em get away!

1883
02:13:57,400 --> 02:13:58,400
Fuckin move!

1884
02:14:09,100 --> 02:14:11,000
I wanna see your hands!
All the hands!

1885
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:12,200
Police!

1886
02:14:15,900 --> 02:14:17,800
Down! Get down!

1887
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:19,400
Stay the fuck there!

1888
02:15:19,100 --> 02:15:20,100
What the hell?

1889
02:15:33,200 --> 02:15:35,300
Stay down!
Down, motherfucker!

1890
02:15:35,700 --> 02:15:36,700
Hands!

1891
02:15:42,100 --> 02:15:43,500
Out of home, baby.

1892
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:56,900
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1893
02:15:57,500 --> 02:15:58,800
You all wait right here.

1894
02:16:24,800 --> 02:16:26,400
Lucas,
please step back inside.

1895
02:16:27,300 --> 02:16:28,800
Please, step inside.

1896
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,200
Respectfully, please,
step inside. Thank you.

1897
02:16:44,400 --> 02:16:45,500
Stay back!

1898
02:16:54,200 --> 02:16:55,500
Yo, the pigs.

1899
02:16:56,500 --> 02:16:58,600
NYPD, everybody stay still.

1900
02:17:01,700 --> 02:17:02,900
Turner! Go!

1901
02:17:40,500 --> 02:17:41,600
"Dead servicemen..."

1902
02:17:41,800 --> 02:17:45,100
"Dead servicemen
trying to defend our country..."

1903
02:17:56,400 --> 02:18:00,200
Ladies and gentlemen, at this stage
of the proceedings, the counsels

1904
02:18:00,500 --> 02:18:02,600
are ready for their opening statements.

1905
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:04,500
For the prosecution,

1906
02:18:04,700 --> 02:18:06,100
Mr. Roberts will proceed

1907
02:18:06,300 --> 02:18:08,300
with his opening statement first.

1908
02:18:08,800 --> 02:18:10,100
Mr. Roberts!

1909
02:18:11,400 --> 02:18:13,000
Are you ready to proceed?

1910
02:18:14,500 --> 02:18:15,700
Yes, your Honor.

1911
02:18:20,100 --> 02:18:22,100
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

1912
02:18:27,100 --> 02:18:30,100
The State will show,
and you will hear

1913
02:18:30,900 --> 02:18:34,100
that Frank Lucas
is the most dangerous man

1914
02:18:34,900 --> 02:18:36,800
walking the streets of our city.

1915
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:41,700
You all get on out.
Let me

1916
02:18:42,300 --> 02:18:43,900
talk to Mr. Richie alone.

1917
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,500
C'mon, I pay you by the hour,
not by the minute.

1918
02:18:53,400 --> 02:18:54,500
Thank you.

1919
02:18:59,400 --> 02:19:01,000
You ain't wearin a wire?

1920
02:19:05,600 --> 02:19:09,700
I was talking to my lawyers,
they said something I can't believe.

1921
02:19:11,400 --> 02:19:12,800
Did you really

1922
02:19:13,100 --> 02:19:14,900
find a million $ in the trunk of a car

1923
02:19:15,100 --> 02:19:16,500
- and then turn it in?
- Yeah.

1924
02:19:16,700 --> 02:19:19,000
You did that for real, huh?
My man!

1925
02:19:19,400 --> 02:19:21,200
Good for you.
Shit...

1926
02:19:21,600 --> 02:19:23,500
You know johnny law
got the dough, right?

1927
02:19:23,700 --> 02:19:25,700
- Maybe.
- Ain't no "maybe", Mr. Richie.

1928
02:19:25,800 --> 02:19:28,000
You know he got it.
You turned that money in,

1929
02:19:28,200 --> 02:19:30,500
he took it, and you ain't
gettin nothin for it, did you?

1930
02:19:30,900 --> 02:19:32,300
Why did you do that?

1931
02:19:32,800 --> 02:19:35,300
- It was the right thing to do.
- It's true.

1932
02:19:35,700 --> 02:19:38,200
Good answer, it was the right thing.
The question I have

1933
02:19:38,400 --> 02:19:41,500
that I've been asking myself
is would you do it again?

1934
02:19:42,600 --> 02:19:44,800
That's a lot of money
and a long time ago.

1935
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:49,800
Many car payments ago.
Many child support payments ago.

1936
02:19:51,300 --> 02:19:55,000
So I said to myself the only way
to find out is to find out.

1937
02:19:56,600 --> 02:19:57,700
<i>Bribery,</i>

1938
02:19:58,400 --> 02:20:00,200
extortion, murder,

1939
02:20:00,800 --> 02:20:02,200
racketeering...

1940
02:20:04,500 --> 02:20:05,900
<i>If you would give me an address,</i>

1941
02:20:06,200 --> 02:20:08,600
<i>I'll make sure the car's there,
and the money's in that trunk.</i>

1942
02:20:09,800 --> 02:20:11,000
No, thanks.

1943
02:20:11,700 --> 02:20:12,900
You sure?

1944
02:20:14,600 --> 02:20:16,900
C'mon now,
what you think, that impresses me?

1945
02:20:17,400 --> 02:20:20,300
You think you're better than them,
you're no better than them other cops,

1946
02:20:20,500 --> 02:20:21,700
You're the same as them.

1947
02:20:21,900 --> 02:20:23,100
You are them.

1948
02:20:23,900 --> 02:20:25,100
Let me ask you this.

1949
02:20:25,300 --> 02:20:28,300
Do you really think
that putting me behind bars

1950
02:20:28,500 --> 02:20:30,200
will change anything on the streets?

1951
02:20:30,400 --> 02:20:34,000
Them dope fiends are going to shoot it,
steal from it, and die for it.

1952
02:20:34,400 --> 02:20:36,400
Putting me in or out
won't change anything.

1953
02:20:37,800 --> 02:20:40,600
- That's the way it is.
- Right, so what we got, Richie?

1954
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:42,700
We got me and you sitting here.

1955
02:20:43,200 --> 02:20:45,900
<i>You got that snitch ass
driving for my brother,</i>

1956
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:47,800
<i>you got a little bit of powder.</i>

1957
02:20:48,100 --> 02:20:49,600
<i>You gonna need more than that.</i>

1958
02:20:49,800 --> 02:20:52,700
<i>I got possession, supply,
conspiracy...</i>

1959
02:20:53,800 --> 02:20:55,100
<i>bribing a law officer.</i>

1960
02:20:55,200 --> 02:20:57,400
<i>I got people attesting
to seeing you kill in cold blood.</i>

1961
02:20:57,900 --> 02:20:59,600
<i>I got your offshore bank accounts,</i>

1962
02:20:59,700 --> 02:21:01,300
<i>your real estate, your businesses.</i>

1963
02:21:01,900 --> 02:21:03,700
All bought with money from heroin.

1964
02:21:05,100 --> 02:21:07,400
I got hundreds of parents
of dead kids

1965
02:21:07,900 --> 02:21:10,500
addicts who o'ded on your product,
and that's my story for the jury,

1966
02:21:10,700 --> 02:21:13,900
that's how I make it all stick.
This man murdered thousands of people.

1967
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,100
And he did it from a penthouse,
driving a Lincoln.

1968
02:21:16,400 --> 02:21:18,200
besides that,
you got nothing to worry about.

1969
02:21:18,400 --> 02:21:21,000
That's pretty good,
but that's why we go to court, right?

1970
02:21:21,100 --> 02:21:22,500
Cause I got witnesses too.

1971
02:21:22,700 --> 02:21:25,000
I got celebrities,
I got sport figures,

1972
02:21:25,100 --> 02:21:26,700
I got Harlem, Richie.

1973
02:21:27,600 --> 02:21:31,000
I took care of Harlem, so it's gonna
take care of me, you can believe that.

1974
02:21:31,300 --> 02:21:33,200
- I got more than that.
- What you got?

1975
02:21:33,600 --> 02:21:36,300
I got a line of people
wanting to testify against you

1976
02:21:36,500 --> 02:21:38,400
that stretches out the door
and around the block.

1977
02:21:38,600 --> 02:21:41,300
<i>- Bullshit.
- You damaged a lot of lives, Frank.</i>

1978
02:21:41,800 --> 02:21:44,500
<i>I got the Mazzano crime family.
You put them out of business.</i>

1979
02:21:44,700 --> 02:21:47,100
I got nothin to do with 'em.
They got nothin to do with me.

1980
02:21:47,300 --> 02:21:49,200
They got everything to do with you.
Know why?

1981
02:21:49,300 --> 02:21:50,300
Why?

1982
02:21:50,500 --> 02:21:52,800
Because
apart from the fact they hate you,

1983
02:21:53,200 --> 02:21:55,900
- they hate what you represent.
- I don't represent nothing

1984
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:57,900
- but Frank Lucas.
- You sure?

1985
02:21:58,300 --> 02:21:59,900
A black businessman like you.

1986
02:22:00,500 --> 02:22:02,300
You represent progress.

1987
02:22:02,800 --> 02:22:05,700
The kind that's gonna see them
lose a lot of money.

1988
02:22:06,400 --> 02:22:08,000
With you out of the way,

1989
02:22:08,200 --> 02:22:10,200
everything can return to normal.

1990
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:12,100
My man.

1991
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,200
You know what normal is to me?

1992
02:22:19,500 --> 02:22:22,000
I ain't see normal
since I was 6 years old.

1993
02:22:23,800 --> 02:22:26,700
Normal is seeing the police
ride up to my house,

1994
02:22:26,800 --> 02:22:29,800
dragging my 12 year old cousin out
and tying him to a pole.

1995
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,700
Shoving a shotgun in his mouth
so hard they bust his teeth.

1996
02:22:32,900 --> 02:22:36,000
Then they bust two shotgun shells
in his head, knocking it off.

1997
02:22:36,100 --> 02:22:37,600
That's what normal is to me.

1998
02:22:37,900 --> 02:22:39,300
Didn't give a fuck about no...

1999
02:22:40,100 --> 02:22:42,600
police then. Don't give a fuck
about no police now.

2000
02:22:42,900 --> 02:22:43,900
Shit.

2001
02:22:44,200 --> 02:22:46,300
You can do whatever you wanna do.

2002
02:22:46,600 --> 02:22:49,100
So it don't mean nothing to me
for you to show up tomorrow

2003
02:22:49,200 --> 02:22:51,100
with your head blown off,
you understand?

2004
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:53,200
Hey, Frank.

2005
02:22:53,500 --> 02:22:54,600
Get in line,

2006
02:22:55,200 --> 02:22:57,400
That one
stretches around the block, too.

2007
02:23:00,900 --> 02:23:02,000
All right.

2008
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:07,300
What you wanna do?

2009
02:23:14,100 --> 02:23:15,600
You know what you gotta do.

2010
02:23:15,900 --> 02:23:17,600
What you want me to do ?
Snitch?

2011
02:23:17,700 --> 02:23:21,300
I know you don't want no cops.
What you want? Gangsters?

2012
02:23:21,700 --> 02:23:22,800
Pick one.

2013
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,100
Jew gangsters, mick gangsters,
guinees?

2014
02:23:25,700 --> 02:23:28,400
They been bleeding Harlem dry
since they got off the boat.

2015
02:23:28,600 --> 02:23:30,900
I don't give a fuck
about no crime figures.

2016
02:23:31,300 --> 02:23:32,400
You can have them.

2017
02:23:33,400 --> 02:23:34,900
I'll take them too.

2018
02:23:35,100 --> 02:23:36,800
You'll take them too?

2019
02:23:42,100 --> 02:23:43,400
No you didn't.

2020
02:23:43,500 --> 02:23:45,600
You talkin about police?
You want police?

2021
02:23:46,600 --> 02:23:49,000
- You want your own kind?
- They're not my kind.

2022
02:23:49,700 --> 02:23:51,800
They're in business with you,
they ain't my kind.

2023
02:23:52,500 --> 02:23:55,800
They ain't my kind
like the Italians are not yours.

2024
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:11,800
What can you promise me, Richie?

2025
02:24:15,400 --> 02:24:18,200
I can promise you,
you lie about one name...

2026
02:24:18,900 --> 02:24:20,500
You'll never get out of prison.

2027
02:24:20,900 --> 02:24:23,600
You lie about one dollar,
one offshore account.

2028
02:24:23,900 --> 02:24:25,500
You'll never get out of prison.

2029
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,300
You can live life rich in jail

2030
02:24:29,600 --> 02:24:31,500
the rest of your boring days,

2031
02:24:31,900 --> 02:24:34,200
or be poor outside for some of them.

2032
02:24:35,400 --> 02:24:37,200
That's what I can promise you.

2033
02:24:40,400 --> 02:24:42,100
<i>I want them cops, Richie.</i>

2034
02:24:44,600 --> 02:24:46,700
That's what I want,
I want them cops

2035
02:24:48,200 --> 02:24:50,700
that took money out of my pockets.

2036
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:55,100
Him too.

2037
02:24:55,600 --> 02:24:56,900
All right.

2038
02:24:59,600 --> 02:25:01,000
Hey, Spearman.

2039
02:25:02,300 --> 02:25:05,100
These guys are all connected
on the grid.

2040
02:25:05,400 --> 02:25:07,700
This guy here, he's in uniform.

2041
02:25:08,800 --> 02:25:12,200
<i>Police officers were arrested
today on charges of taking bribes</i>

2042
02:25:12,300 --> 02:25:14,700
<i>- from drug traffickers.
- Well done, Jimmy!</i>

2043
02:25:15,100 --> 02:25:17,100
<i>The investigation into police corruption</i>

<i>broadened today with the arrest...</i>

2046
02:25:22,200 --> 02:25:25,000
You're under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.

<i>In what's being called the city's

Trupo.

2065
02:26:20,100 --> 02:26:21,300
You are special.

2066
02:27:05,300 --> 02:27:06,800
It's good work, Frank.

2067
02:27:08,300 --> 02:27:09,300
You know...

2068
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,200
You don't want a drink or somethin'?

2069
02:27:12,500 --> 02:27:13,600
To celebrate.

2070
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:15,600
You got any holy water?

2071
02:28:09,900 --> 02:28:11,200
