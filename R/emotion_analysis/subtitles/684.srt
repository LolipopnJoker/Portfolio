1
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,304
Law offices.

2
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:01,562
You know what I want to be
when I grow up?

3
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:03,818
- What?
- A fisherman.

4
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,409
I want to go fishing
every day till I'm rich

5
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,578
so I can move right next
door to the jailhouse,

6
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:11,326
so I can be close to my mommy.

7
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:16,869
She got arrested for drugs again,
so she has to go back.

8
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:22,044
I'm sorry to hear that.

9
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:29,223
My mommy's breath smells so bad
'cause she smokes so much crack.

10
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,723
What do you think?

11
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,263
What do I think? About what?

12
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,268
My mommy's bad breath.

13
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,441
Maybe it'll get better.

14
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,944
Thank you. That helps.

15
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,994
Yeah. Yeah! Thanks for nothing, Derek.

16
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,119
What is the matter with you,
Kimmie?

17
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,951
All right, come on.
We got to go see your grandpa.

18
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:00,129
Not Grandpa. He's a kook!

19
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:04,838
Oh, my goodness. You are limber!

20
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,336
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

21
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:11,264
Phew.

22
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,554
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

23
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:27,398
Ooh, well, hello! I think I know her.

24
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:32,118
Mmm...

25
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,003
Mr. Zisman?

26
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,252
Mr. Zisman.

27
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,083
- Mr. Zisman!
- Hmm?

28
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,417
Hi.

29
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:50,762
I'm, uh, afraid I have some bad news.

30
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:56,595
Your wife, she took a turn for the
worse last night and she passed away.

31
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,685
I'm so sorry.

32
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,186
Oh!

33
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,112
I thought she'd never die.

34
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:15,408
I'm going to let you process this, and,
uh, I'll be back in just a moment, okay?

35
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:18,453
Thank you. Thank you, Doc!

36
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:24,956
Don't get me wrong, I'm upset,
but she was a crabby old bat.

37
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,040
Well, I'm sorry for your loss.

38
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,377
She hadn't given me any nookie
since the '90s.

39
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,713
And then it was only out of spite.

40
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,640
She's in a much better place.

41
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,477
And I'm in a much better place.

42
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:45,143
Did you hear that, Leroy?
We're free!

43
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:48,646
I'm free.

44
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,262
Hello, lady.

45
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:26,855
Thanks a lot.

46
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:43,825
Ooh.

47
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:55,837
Shit!

48
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,569
Oh.

49
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:33,421
Uh-oh. Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

50
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:36,344
Miss.

51
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,922
Sir, can you help me?
Can you help me, sir?

52
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:40,849
I don't expect you to understand,

53
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:44,269
but I have my penis
stuck to the soda machine.

54
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:48,273
Gabriel! I'm stuck.

55
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:54,022
- What's wrong?
- My penis is stuck in the machine!

56
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,781
Gabriel! Help me!

57
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:59,109
Help me! Ah! Gabriel!

58
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,286
Gabriel!

59
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,452
Sir. Could you help me, sir?

60
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,713
This nigga's dick's stuck
in the machine, yo!

61
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,131
Please don't announce it!

62
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:14,548
It's fucking embarrassing!

63
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,376
Can you help me
instead of announcing?

64
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:20,047
Please! It's not funny!

65
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,598
It's not funny!

66
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:23,641
Help! Give me a hand!

67
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:25,677
Sir.

68
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,185
- Could you help me?
- What you want?

69
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:31,187
I'm in a bad situation.

70
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,689
I gotta get unstuck!

71
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,401
Can you help?

72
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,733
Jiggle my shoulders.

73
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,660
Jiggle my shoulders.
Ow! Ow!

74
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,784
- Nothing I can do.
- Jiggle my...

75
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:45,989
Jiggle!

76
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,325
Jiggle! Ow! Ow.

77
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,915
Oh, my God.

78
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,253
Oh. Oh! He's trying
to rip that dick out!

79
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,176
Oh, no!

80
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,594
- Stop!
- Stop, man!

81
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,381
Sir?

82
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,843
Don't...
It's not going to come out.

83
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,052
Fuck.

84
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,688
Don't! Quit pulling on it.

85
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,266
I got to get... Oh, God!

86
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:13,396
Ah!

87
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:16,524
Push! Push! God! Push! Push!

88
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,355
Oh, God! Oh, God!

89
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,873
You looking for something?

90
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,125
Yes, ma'am,
I'm looking for a suit.

91
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,456
Okay.

92
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,960
Wow, what's your name?

93
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,007
- Judy.
- Judy.

94
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,051
- Nice to meet you.
- ...you are so beautiful.

95
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,549
- Thank you.
- Oh, my goodness.

96
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,098
My wife just passed away.

97
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,426
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

98
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,807
It wasn't the greatest
marriage anyway, Judy.

99
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,057
That's why I'm gonna take
a little me time now, Judy.

100
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,859
- And have some fun.
- Uh-huh. See?

101
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,738
By fun, I mean banging the gong.

102
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:06,661
I might be too old to fry the rice, but I
can still chop the suey, that's for sure.

103
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,785
How long does it take
to do alterations?

104
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,866
Um... Do you need a hurry?

105
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,043
Uh, the funeral's tomorrow.

106
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,872
- Oh. Do you need a tie?
- Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

107
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,378
Okay, what color the tie you likey?

108
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:22,677
Uh, I likey any color.
You pick one out for me.

109
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,971
Well...
How about that one right there?

110
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:28,596
- Uh... Which one? You mean this one?
- Right there. Yes.

111
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,224
That looks like it's green.

112
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,600
- Oh, that's very nice.
- Yeah. Okay?

113
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,604
- How much is that shirt?
- Sixty-five.

114
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,230
- That's a lot of scratch.
- Forty per cent.

115
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,029
- Forty per cent.
- That's a lot of scratch.

116
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,483
- So, forty per cent.
- Yeah.

117
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,658
Is that a squirrel right there?

118
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,920
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

119
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,543
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

120
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,717
- You got me, you got me.
- Yup, I got you good.

121
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,215
- You got me.
- Yup, I got you over a felony.

122
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,047
- Oh, God.
- Have a seat.

123
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,177
Yes, sir.

124
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:11,135
- Do not get up out of that chair.
- Yes, sir.

125
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,221
I apologize.

126
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,682
Get my shit off.

127
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:17,732
Get your shit off?

128
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:20,686
Get my shirt off.
Get my coat off. Get my pants off.

129
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,567
I gotta take your pants off?

130
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:25,615
- You better believe it.
- Well, that sounds a little weird.

131
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,910
Go in here and get the damn pants off.

132
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:32,455
You want me to take your pants off,
that seems a little weird.

133
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:48,631
Thank you, kind people,
for being here today.

134
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:54,349
I never thought my wife's funeral
would be filled with complete strangers,

135
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:58,398
but we've outlived all our friends.

136
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:02,148
I was hoping my daughter and grandson
could make it but...

137
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:05,822
They didn't.

138
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:13,121
So, I would especially like to thank
the choir and caterers,

139
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,954
and all the nice people
sitting before me.

140
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,956
Thank you.

141
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:25,960
I wished you could have seen the young
Ellie, the woman I fell in love with.

142
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:29,216
She was like a flash of bright light.

143
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:33,141
A callipygian princess who drew
people to her like a magnet.

144
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:36,220
And for those of you who don't
know what callipygian means,

145
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,475
it means she has a nice bottom.

146
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:39,681
Ooh.

147
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,732
She did.

148
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,233
I wish I had more time with her.

149
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:50,818
I wish so much of our time
had not been consumed by combat.

150
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,867
I wish I 'd tried a little harder
to make that happen.

151
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,615
Because she's gone now.

152
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:01,420
And our history on this earth
has been written...

153
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:04,756
Baby.

154
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,752
Hi, sweetie.

155
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:10,762
- Hi, buddy.
- Hi.

156
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:13,548
Sit.

157
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,758
This is my daughter and grandson.

158
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,055
Can I have a word with you?

159
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,350
Yeah, I'm in the middle of something.

160
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,026
Billy, just stay there for a second.

161
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,195
I just want to
talk to your granddad outside.

162
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,271
Okay, Mom.

163
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,449
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

164
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,409
Hi, Billy.

165
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:38,705
What's so important?

166
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:41,000
Listen, I'm sorry
that she's dead and everything,

167
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,710
but I'm in some serious shit, okay?

168
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,879
What is it this time?
- You tell him about the microphone.

169
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,173
Don't even start
that with me! Not now!

170
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,171
Okay? It wasn't even my fault!

171
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,878
This cop, he's got a bug up his ass,

172
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,840
and then they give me this public
defender who's a fucking idiot!

173
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:55,890
And...

174
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,013
Sir, excuse me.
The microphone is on.

175
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,436
Please, just give me a moment.
Just give me a moment.

176
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:05,939
Look, I violated my parole and now
they're gonna send me to jail.

177
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:09,150
I just need you to
take Billy across the country

178
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,072
so he can be with his dad for a while.
Okay?

179
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,194
What?

180
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:15,197
I can't have Bobby with me now.
I'm in mourning!

181
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,119
It's Billy. Billy!

182
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:19,414
How am I supposed to know
what his name is?

183
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,036
You never brought him around!

184
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,834
And when you did bring him around,
he pissed every bed in the house.

185
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:24,991
I don't pee my bed anymore.

186
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,668
I cannot have Billy
with me now.

187
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,466
I am a free man
for the first time in 46 years

188
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:34,045
and I can't be saddled
with that cockblock!

189
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,254
That's just fine.

190
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,635
You were never there for me
when I was little,

191
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,315
so I guess it's no different now, is it?

192
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,852
I'm going to talk to my mom.

193
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:50,729
I am very sorry. Um...

194
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,740
Everyone's very
emotional right now.

195
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,538
It's a very difficult
time for the family.

196
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,194
Uh...

197
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,372
I don't know what to say.

198
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,289
Sweetie, come here.
That's your mother's.

199
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:08,212
- She told me I could have it.
- Give me the... Give it...

200
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,292
Don't do this in front of them!
Don't do this right now!

201
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:12,921
Just stop...

202
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,048
Oh, no!

203
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,470
Oh, God! Jesus!

204
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,388
Oh, no.

205
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,635
Grandma?

206
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,975
- I love you.
- Oh, baby.

207
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,978
Sorry, Daddy.

208
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:25,647
On, baby!

209
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,313
Oh, my God!

210
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,486
Sing! Please, choir, sing something.
Somebody help.

211
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:36,908
I've got the joy, joy, joy, joy
down in my heart

212
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:40,078
Down in my heart, down in my heart

213
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:43,828
I've got the joy, joy, joy, joy
down in my heart

214
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:47,161
Down in my heart to stay

215
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,839
I've got the love of Jesus
down in my heart

216
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:51,914
Where?

217
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,672
Down in my heart, down in my heart

218
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:59,006
I've got the love of Jesus
down in my heart

219
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,343
Down in my heart to stay

220
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:06,179
I've got the joy, joy, joy, joy
down in my heart

221
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,852
Down in my heart to stay

222
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,900
Fuck.

223
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,323
Where are we going?

224
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,818
We're going here to
get on a computer call with your dad

225
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,903
to see when he's gonna
pick your little ass up.

226
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,745
And I got someone meeting us to help
me and your father communicate,

227
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,576
seeing how we don't get along.

228
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,832
Are you Mr. Zisman?

229
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,254
- Hi.
- Shirley Kreska.

230
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,751
- Nice to meet you, Shirley.
- Nice to meet you.

231
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:17,835
Well, tell me the
purpose of the call.

232
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,420
His mother is going to jail.

233
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,847
But she wanted me to
get him to his father.

234
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,926
We've had lots of problems
out of the father.

235
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:28,603
He's nearly impossible
to communicate with.

236
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:32,064
But is your goal to
get him to his dad?

237
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,524
Yes, yes.

238
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,939
I got him up on the computer now.

239
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,273
All right, Chuck. This is Shirley.

240
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,776
Hi, Chuck.
I'm a local counselor,

241
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:46,780
and I'm just here to help the two of you
reach whatever goals you want to reach

242
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,789
and just help the two
of you talk together.

243
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:49,949
Okay.

244
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:56,457
So, uh, Kimmie is going to
jail again, all right?

245
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,299
Doesn't surprise me.

246
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:02,296
So I'm gonna need you to come
get Billy, like, from me.

247
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,053
Why are you shaking your head?

248
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,060
'Cause this is real bad timing
right now for me.

249
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,062
And I'm having some problems
with my business right now.

250
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,640
- Okay.
- Your business, huh?

251
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,145
What business is that?

252
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,643
I sell computers.

253
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,895
Sell... He couldn't sell
pussy on a troop train.

254
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,738
Oh, that's a disgusting thing to say.

255
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,235
Okay, but that doesn't help.
That doesn't help.

256
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:23,817
You're right. You're right.

257
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,243
I'm sorry for insulting you.

258
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:29,656
Are you serious?

259
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,329
This is a disaster.

260
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,002
All right, Chuck.

261
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,168
If you can't come to Lincoln,

262
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,834
then I'll just bring him to you
in North Carolina.

263
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,465
No. 'Cause I don't have money
to take care of a kid.

264
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:46,343
My cousin,
he just had to take his baby girl,

265
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,096
and the state's paying him
$600 a month for free.

266
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,428
Are you sure
you want him to go to him?

267
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,184
- He's getting 600 bucks?
- A month.

268
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,605
Wait, what are they saying?

269
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,354
She's saying possibly
he could get money for keeping him.

270
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,435
I think I can work something out.

271
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:05,533
I think that if Irving was to bring him
here to Raleigh, I could take the kid.

272
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:08,028
And then if it didn't work out...

273
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,780
600 bucks a month
will make it work for me.

274
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,375
So... And that isn't
guaranteed, what she just said.

275
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,451
It's something
you would have to investigate.

276
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,503
No, no, it's guaranteed.
She's always right.

277
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,018
It's a done deal, man. Drop him off.

278
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,544
All right, 2:00 on Sunday.
- 2:00 p.m. Sunday.

279
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,803
Great, man. Great. Great.

280
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,972
There goes like half my inventory.

281
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,469
What a wonderful business you have.

282
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:30,910
Okay.
Chuck, what's your last name?

283
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,140
- Muskie.
- M...

284
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:36,189
- M-U-S-K-I-E.
- Okay.

285
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:39,734
- D-O-U-C-H-E is how you spell it.
- Yeah.

286
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:43,734
That's right.
F-A-G-O-T is your last name.

287
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,823
Your son's right here,
if you don't mind.

288
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,821
Bye, A-S-S-O-L-E.

289
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,403
Shitbird, dummy butt.

290
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,329
Let's just walk away.

291
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:54,999
Suck it.

292
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:56,626
"Suck it," that's nice.

293
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:58,328
Suck a bowl of dicks.

294
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:01,001
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, Billy!

295
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:02,881
Bye.

296
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,522
Hey, Billy, let me show
you what you're going to do

297
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,599
if somebody comes at you with a knife.

298
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:20,683
Come here.

299
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,689
Have any of those baskets down here
that you have outside?

300
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,816
I don't think so.

301
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,987
You don't think so.
You don't know?

302
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,940
Don't interrupt, grandpa, I'm busy.

303
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,947
So if a guy comes at
you with a knife...

304
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,619
You don't care about a sale?

305
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:32,866
Yeah, I care about a sale.

306
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,744
But I'm trying to teach my grandson
about knife fights.

307
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,076
And you keep yapping. Jesus.

308
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:42,505
- Good attitude to have.
- Yeah, keep walking, gramps.

309
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,629
Okay, now, if a guy
comes at you in a knife fight.

310
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,881
Like, come at me,
I'll show you what you do.

311
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,132
That's all you gotta do.

312
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,964
You take it and you stick
it right in their thigh.

313
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,969
And then they can't run after you.

314
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:59,306
You young ladies
in the market for a nice bed?

315
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,389
- No.
- No.

316
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,066
Seventy-five dollars.

317
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,358
What's special about it?

318
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:05,732
It's got that special
vibrating feature.

319
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,358
You know what I'm saying?

320
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:09,065
You want to see how it works?

321
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,866
No, thanks, honey.

322
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:14,491
My wife and I only had it two weeks
before she went in the hospital.

323
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,742
I'm so sorry.

324
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,165
That's okay, that's okay.
It's barely been used.

325
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,163
- Yeah.
- And she passed away.

326
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:23,587
- Oh, dear. That's very sad.
- Yeah.

327
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:26,337
Well, it's not so sad,
she was kind of a bitch, but...

328
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,588
Jeez!

329
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,386
My goodness!

330
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:34,261
Well, gotta call
a spade a spade.

331
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,763
Well, there goes the troublemaker.

332
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,476
Well, what kind of attitude is that?

333
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,648
- Same type you have.
- Same kind of 'tude you got.

334
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:43,849
Wow.

335
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:45,685
Mr. and Mrs. Happy.

336
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:51,028
How much is this?

337
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:53,405
Is there a price tag on it?

338
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:54,906
I don't... There's a...

339
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,743
That's one of my
wife's favorite lamps.

340
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:59,449
- It's very pretty.
- Yes.

341
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:03,377
She died of, uh, vagitosis.

342
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:06,080
It's kind of like bad breath,
but the vagina.

343
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,132
It wasn't the main cause, but...

344
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,635
- It didn't help.
- Yeah.

345
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:12,712
That's...

346
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,510
I'm sorry to hear that.

347
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,052
Ma'am,
will you buy that please?

348
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:22,389
No, thank you.
I don't need it, I have one.

349
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:27,898
Ma'am, how do you explain
what a cockblock is to an eight-year-old?

350
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,071
Can you help me explain that?

351
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:32,399
'Cause that's what's sitting
there is a little cockblock.

352
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,775
You're a good boy. Remember that.

353
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:37,578
No, he's not.
Don't listen to her.

354
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,371
He's a good boy.

355
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:42,291
If you like him so damn much,
you take him.

356
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,869
Do you like this chair?

357
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:46,830
That is pretty cool.

358
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,539
It's only $25.

359
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,340
Wow. That's nice.

360
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,803
This bed's going for
a pretty good price.

361
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:56,006
I'd like to lay down
and take a nap myself.

362
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,136
- I'm tired all the time.
- Yeah.

363
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,655
Is it one of those
ones that adjusts?

364
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,219
Yes, ma'am, it's really good.

365
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:06,524
It's one of those that kind of sit
up while you're watching TV.

366
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,226
Here, try, uh... I'll, uh...

367
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,901
Try to adjust it a little.

368
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:14,565
Whoa!

369
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:15,740
Whoa, stop!

370
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:17,572
Oh, my God!

371
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,324
Whoa, stop.
Oh, my God!

372
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,826
Stop, stop! Whoa, stop!

373
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,286
Unplug it!

374
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:26,039
Oh, my God!
What are you trying to do to me?

375
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:28,754
All I did was push
the little button!

376
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:33,673
Oh, God! Put it down!
Put it... Cramp! Cramp!

377
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,924
- Ah!
- It's unplugged!

378
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:38,597
- Oh.
- It's unplugged, I pulled the plug.

379
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,924
Oh, my God.

380
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,430
Unplug that thing over there, please.

381
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,853
I'm getting off.

382
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:46,021
Oh. Oh, God.

383
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,313
- Let Grandpa sit.
- I pushed the little button.

384
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,436
He told me to push the little button.

385
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:50,189
Let Grandpa sit.

386
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:55,026
I think I'm going to have a
heart attack. I really do.

387
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,742
Well, let's not make this
all about you, honey.

388
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:01,913
Oh, no, no, I'm telling her.
I'm not making it...

389
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,283
Look...

390
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:08,206
Just calm down. It's okay.

391
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,628
My breathing won't come back.

392
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,798
You can have the bed for $50.

393
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,634
No, I don't want that bed.

394
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,314
Coming!

395
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,490
Hey, sir, how are you?

396
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,234
Do you have a bed
we're supposed to pick up?

397
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,194
Right this way.
- Alrighty.

398
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:44,451
- My name's Irving, what's your name?
- Tom.

399
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,373
Tom. How are you, Tom? Come on in.

400
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,417
This is my grandson, Billy.

401
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:49,914
- Hi, Billy. How are you?
- Hi.

402
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:51,434
- What's your name, sir?
- I'm James.

403
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:54,840
James. How are you, James?
Come on in. We're back here.

404
00:22:56,333 --> 00:23:00,338
And, um, my wife just passed
away a couple days ago

405
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:02,970
and the damn funeral home
had a little misunderstanding.

406
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,343
Like, you know what,
"We'll just take her right back."

407
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:08,475
We want to get her in my trunk,

408
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:11,933
because we're gonna
bury her down south a ways.

409
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:15,862
If you could help me to my car,
I would really appreciate it.

410
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:18,360
Let me just...

411
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,033
Okay, um...

412
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,360
Just wrap her up.

413
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:26,538
I think it'll be easiest
if you just pull like that.

414
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:29,538
Yeah. She was a pain in my ass
when we were married

415
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:33,128
and she passed away,
she's still being a pain in my ass.

416
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,882
Just grab that right there.

417
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,547
James, will you get the head?

418
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:44,052
Be gentle with her.

419
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:45,929
Here you go, James.

420
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:49,390
- Here you go.
- Lord have mercy. Jesus.

421
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,642
There you go.

422
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:52,473
Don't let her fall
out of there, James.

423
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,058
Get a good hold on her.

424
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,731
Oh, man. We're, uh...

425
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,818
We got to get this little
boy to his father.

426
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:02,900
His mom just got thrown in jail.

427
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,485
My mom's on drugs.

428
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:05,865
Lord have mercy!

429
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:08,198
Thank you, boys.
I couldn't carry her myself.

430
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:12,751
Just put her right in there.

431
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:16,080
And, uh, we got blankets
to keep her warm.

432
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:19,090
All right, be careful with her.

433
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,256
All right.

434
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:30,265
Thank you.
Thank you, James.

435
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,142
Come here, Billy.

436
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:35,896
Grab his hand.
Can we say a prayer?

437
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:42,065
Lord, please look after Billy and I
on our journey with Ellie.

438
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:47,787
And Lord, please look after these men
because they were very sweet

439
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:49,534
and they're also accomplices

440
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:52,366
to probably what was
technically a crime,

441
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,577
but we're not gonna say anything.

442
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,664
Come on, man!
Are you serious?

443
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,293
In your name we pray. Amen.

444
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:00,465
Amen.

445
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:01,884
All right.

446
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:04,549
Let me ask you a question,
is the bed really going?

447
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:07,177
- No, no. I just needed help with her.
- Oh.

448
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:09,099
But no one's going to come out...

449
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:11,267
No one's going to come out
to help if you say,

450
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,974
"Can you come help me
commit a crime?"

451
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:15,226
No one's gonna help. So...

452
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:18,024
We, uh...

453
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,229
That's why we had to
tell a little fib.

454
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:24,986
But we surely appreciate it.
And our lips are sealed.

455
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,487
- Later.
- Thank the men.

456
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:27,568
See you, Billy.

457
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:28,948
- Thank you.
- Thank you, fellas!

458
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:30,029
See you later.

459
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,365
God bless you.
God bless you, James. Thank you!

460
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:34,075
Thanks for the crime!

461
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:36,581
Now get your crap.
We got to hit the road.

462
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:40,835
All right.

463
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:43,337
Grandpa, do you think
we'll have time to go fishing?

464
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:46,588
Don't worry me with that.
Just get in the damn car.

465
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,818
I hope you went
to the bathroom already.

466
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,366
- Nope.
- "Nope"?

467
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:10,119
Well, you're gonna have to hold it.

468
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,301
Can I turn on the AC?

469
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:35,807
No.

470
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,811
Can I turn on the radio?

471
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,312
No!

472
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:44,478
Let's just play the quiet game.

473
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,821
Can we get something to eat?

474
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:52,411
You're already eating.

475
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:54,997
- But I'm hungry!
- Whatever.

476
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,825
Anything to get out of this car.

477
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:03,498
Hola, gorgeous!
I gotta feed this little prick.

478
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:09,003
She is muy bonita, huh?
My goodness!

479
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,681
Grandpa, look at that ride!
Can I go ride it?

480
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:14,675
- What?
- Can I go ride that?

481
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:18,016
Yes. Shit.

482
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,597
- Scram.
- Thank you.

483
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:23,901
Ah. What's your name?
- Gloria.

484
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:27,105
My Spanish name is
El Mucho Ding-Dong.

485
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:30,070
- It doesn't work!
- Oh, God.

486
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,863
- Grandpa!
- What?

487
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:33,319
This thing doesn't work!

488
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,913
- What do you want me to do about it?
- Fix it!

489
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:40,326
- Can't you see I was talking to a lady?
- Yes, but look!

490
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:42,787
Did you put money in there? God.

491
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,714
- Try it. It doesn't work.
- Oh, God!

492
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,429
God!

493
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:55,632
Ow.

494
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:57,763
Oh, man.

495
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,433
Damn thing's broke.

496
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:04,608
- Come on.
- You put in 50 cents.

497
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:05,684
Nothing!

498
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,022
Oh! Ow! Ah!

499
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:13,617
Sit down, sit down.

500
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,528
Ah!

501
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:21,538
- Oh, I'm all right!
- Sit down, sir.

502
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:23,085
Sit, Sit, sit!

503
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,083
Are you okay, Grandpa?

504
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:26,789
Look what happened!

505
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:29,584
- Jesus!
It didn't work!

506
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,384
I shouldn't have even been on there.

507
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,054
You ruined the store.

508
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,475
Why'd you tell me
to get in there?

509
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,552
'Cause I wanted you to fix it.

510
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,975
Well, it's fixed!

511
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,231
Sir, would you please listen to me?

512
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:47,275
I want you to sit down
on a cushion until...

513
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:48,898
I want the ambulance to check you out.

514
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,695
Listen, it is not your fault.

515
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:52,773
You are not over that weight limit.
Do you understand?

516
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:53,857
What weight limit?

517
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:55,461
There's no weight limit on that thing.

518
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:59,120
Hey, I don't have a weight limit either.
If you know what I mean.

519
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:01,995
Unbelievable!
You could have broke my neck!

520
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:03,993
I didn't do anything!

521
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,213
I can't do it.
I can't do it.

522
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,507
- Do what?
- This!

523
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,502
I can't do this.

524
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:17,719
I said I'd get you to your father's,
but I didn't say how.

525
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:20,892
Grandpa, my leg's falling asleep!

526
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:22,435
Look, you little shitbird,

527
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:25,515
I'm not driving you
and you're too young to ride the bus,

528
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,440
so you keep quiet in there!

529
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,487
You need some help?

530
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:34,314
- I think I got it.
- Okay.

531
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,571
- Oh, my goodness.
- Okay.

532
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,820
- Here we go.
- Okay.

533
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:44,249
I'm going to send this
to Raleigh, North Carolina.

534
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:45,876
Raleigh? Okay.

535
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:47,419
Eighteen width.

536
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:50,622
Uh...

537
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,128
- Forty-seven?
- Forty-seven.

538
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,551
- Forty-seven.
- Yeah.

539
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,929
- Damn it.
- Okay.

540
00:29:58,005 --> 00:29:59,507
Oh, there's something
moving around in there.

541
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:00,590
Really?

542
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:02,434
- No. No.
- No?

543
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:06,017
There's something in that box!

544
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:07,313
No.

545
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:10,313
There's nothing in the box?
It sounds like it!

546
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:13,771
I do hear stuff in here,
but it's not coming from there.

547
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:15,527
- Okay. Can we unstrap it?
- You mind if we unstrap it?

548
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:18,529
- Yes... No, let's unstrap it.
- Okay.

549
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,781
- Grandpa, I got to pee.

550
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:22,571
What...

551
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:25,115
Keep it down.

552
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:28,998
It's a statue.
I have a statue in there.

553
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,913
It still has batteries
in it or something?

554
00:30:30,939 --> 00:30:32,732
Yes, it has the
batteries in it still.

555
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,166
Okay. Okay.

556
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:38,337
Yeah, it's just one of those kind
that you hit a button and it...

557
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,967
So we shook it.

558
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:41,424
Yeah, yeah.

559
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,311
Grandpa, I got to pee real bad.

560
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:47,729
It's a statue.

561
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,226
Are you sure?

562
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:51,559
It was settling.
It was settling.

563
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,518
Okay. All right.

564
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:55,275
Can we get it weighed?
Because I gotta...

565
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:58,107
- You gotta get out?
- Yes, and I appreciate you girls...

566
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:02,277
Would you...

567
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:03,954
God, what are you doing?

568
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:05,952
We were shipping a human being!

569
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:07,578
Oh, my.

570
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,000
Oh, my!

571
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:10,418
We can't ship humans.

572
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:12,622
I'm trying to get him to his father,

573
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,628
and I don't want to drive him.

574
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,254
Oh, my goodness!

575
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:19,211
- What's your name?
- Billy.

576
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,342
- You've had Billy for the school year?
- No, no.

577
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:24,049
- And he's going back for the summer?
- I just got him today.

578
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,429
And you already want to send him back?

579
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:29,889
- You got him today!
- Yeah, my wife passed.

580
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,812
- Aw! I'm sorry to hear it.
- Your grandmother?

581
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,725
Did he love Grandma?

582
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:35,937
- No.
- He didn't?

583
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,238
If you'd have met her,
you'd have felt the same way.

584
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,611
You think she died of a broken heart?

585
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,691
Heart attack.

586
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:42,822
Well, I can tell you
what she didn't die of.

587
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:43,902
Fellatio.

588
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,454
Oh, my.

589
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:47,868
It'll get there overnight.

590
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:49,515
You know that they're just gonna be

591
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:51,206
throwing you around and everything,
don't you?

592
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:54,208
Well, give me a pen
and we'll write "fragile" on it.

593
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,794
Are you sure
you want to do this?

594
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:58,375
You need a blanket?

595
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,301
- We can't ship a human!
- I'll take one.

596
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:03,051
You can if you didn't
know this happened.

597
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,974
I can't ship you. You're living!

598
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:09,470
- Should we call the police on them?
- Oh, no! No police.

599
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,025
Just help me get him out of the box.
I'll take him.

600
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,106
Shit! Come on.

601
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:29,327
Been in this car all damn day!

602
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,408
I need a break.

603
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:35,079
Where are we going?

604
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:37,665
Grandpa's going to
play a little bingo.

605
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:39,420
- Can I come?
- No!

606
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:44,429
Look. They don't allow kids and I'm
going to be talking to ladies in there.

607
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,927
And I don't need you cockblocking.

608
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:48,847
G-51.

609
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,853
N-42.

610
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:56,517
G-60.

611
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:00,028
It's been a while since I've played.

612
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:03,778
Nice to meet you, ma'am.
Good luck.

613
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:05,029
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

614
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,951
- My name is O.Z.
- O.Z.!

615
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:08,119
- O.z.
- All right!

616
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,201
Can I cheat off you?

617
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,953
B-2.

618
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:13,705
G-46.

619
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:19,878
O.Z., what do you say we blow this joint
and go play a little strip bingo outside?

620
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,629
Stop it.

621
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:25,216
That damn dauber's not... Oh.

622
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:28,765
God damn it. Done spilled everywhere.

623
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:34,350
N-62.

624
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,394
Stop the game. Stop!

625
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:39,897
Oh, my gosh!

626
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:42,229
Oh.

627
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:44,565
I think this shit's done
gone bad.

628
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,359
Oh, my God!

629
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:51,576
He just drunk the dauber shit.

630
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:53,657
Oh, man!
You can't do that!

631
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:55,250
Hell, no!

632
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:57,836
- Yuck.
- Stop.

633
00:33:57,911 --> 00:33:59,083
Stop!

634
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,005
Stop?
Hell, keep going!

635
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:03,922
- You're making everybody sick.
- No, come on, come on!

636
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:07,762
Let's go back to the damn game,
all right?

637
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:13,101
God damn!
You guys are driving me to drink!

638
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:15,600
I need a drink.

639
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:20,893
What the hell you got?

640
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:24,321
I got a damn margarita!
Who wants a margarita?

641
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:30,030
O.Z., half of this is for you.

642
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:32,616
How about a little fun, people?

643
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:55,970
Excuse me? Sir?
Can you tie my shoe, please?

644
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,099
Yeah, sure.

645
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,021
- Are you married?
- Yeah.

646
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:03,319
- Are you happily married?
- Yeah, I guess so.

647
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,398
Why do you ask?

648
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:12,611
- I want a new dad.
- Oh, do you?

649
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:14,742
Yeah, sorry.

650
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:17,574
- What's your name?
- Dan.

651
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:20,331
Hey, Dan, I got an idea.

652
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,839
How about me being your new kid?

653
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,416
Um...

654
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:30,132
I don't know if it's really
quite that simple.

655
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,179
You know, you can't really, uh...

656
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:33,222
Why?

657
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:36,768
You can't really trade kids
between families, can you?

658
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,686
Sure you can, Dad.

659
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:43,350
You know, when I was overseas,
when you would sleep with a prostitute,

660
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:46,152
they would squeeze lime juice
on your schmeckle

661
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,104
to see if you had any diseases.

662
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:50,316
And if you went, "Ow!"

663
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:54,031
it means you got something,
'cause the cuts burn.

664
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:57,698
I never went, "Ow!" But one time.

665
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:04,288
It's all cleared up now, though.

666
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:06,715
Ma'am, it's all cleared up.

667
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,133
- Oh, okay.
- All right.

668
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:11,177
Just to prove to you
I don't have anything, ladies,

669
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:13,846
I'm gonna squeeze this lime juice
on my schmeckle right now.

670
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:16,466
- Oh, my God!
- Okay.

671
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:19,306
Why resist? Watch this.
Here it goes. Here it goes!

672
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:21,730
Nothing. Nothing.

673
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:24,065
I got nothing.

674
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,393
That is free advertising right there.

675
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:30,155
It did sting a little when it got to my
bunghole though, I'll tell you that.

676
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,949
That's just between us girls.

677
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,614
I'm gonna have to
have that checked out.

678
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:39,539
G-47.

679
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,958
Bingo!

680
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,201
Ha ha!

681
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:45,454
Bingo!

682
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,457
Bingo!

683
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:51,714
Can someone
check that bingo for me, please?

684
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,386
There's no N!

685
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,384
You hush. You hush.

686
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,840
You don't tell me to hush.

687
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:57,890
You hush, too.

688
00:36:57,966 --> 00:36:58,967
You hush.

689
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:02,600
No, I won't. I'm a grown man.
I can talk. I can talk.

690
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,973
I can talk.

691
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,353
Tattletales.

692
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:11,360
The bingo is not possible because
we have no N, so we will keep playing.

693
00:37:11,438 --> 00:37:13,657
Well, shit!

694
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:18,571
G-53.

695
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,911
What happened to your dad?

696
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,826
Hey, Dad.

697
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,003
Yeah, what happened to him?

698
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,830
- No, you're my dad.
- Hmm?

699
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,460
High five, Dad.

700
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,922
Down low. Too slow.

701
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,921
Yeah, that one's been around
for a while.

702
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,266
Who are you here with?

703
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:42,510
You. My new dad.

704
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:45,264
Well, I'm not your new dad. But...

705
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:46,768
You're funny.

706
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:47,849
Um...

707
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:51,436
Hey, Dad, look at me in the eye.

708
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,231
- Like...
- I love you.

709
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,657
Anyway, I need to, uh...

710
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:02,789
I got stuff I have to
do, uh, so be safe.

711
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,742
Love you, Dad!

712
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,288
Oh, here she is!

713
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,872
Here I am.
You want to buy some 22s?

714
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,045
- What are 22s?
- You wish you was 22.

715
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:16,128
They look like 36D's to me.

716
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:18,384
No.

717
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:21,637
No? 36 full C's.

718
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,852
22s, that's what they are!

719
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,556
Can I use your pen?

720
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,725
Yes, you may, sweetheart.

721
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:34,564
- All right! How you doing?
- Okay.

722
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:38,651
- You know, you're pretty sexy.
- Thank you.

723
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,827
I mean really sexy.

724
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:42,741
I...

725
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:45,324
- I have to take this up there.
- All right.

726
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,752
What's your name, sweetheart?

727
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:00,346
I'm getting froze out.

728
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:06,178
- Did you win any money at bingo?
- No.

729
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,686
You shouldn't drink so much.

730
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,229
Pipe down!

731
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,357
Oh, God.

732
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,363
Do you have any idea
how heavy you are?

733
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:20,154
Do you have any idea
how I don't give a shit?

734
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:24,450
Where are we going?

735
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,952
Just keep going straight.

736
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,454
- You getting tired?
- Yeah.

737
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:33,129
Are you an alcoholic?

738
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,956
No, I'm not an alcoholic.

739
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,633
I wouldn't be surprised
if you are.

740
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:41,921
Just had a couple too many.

741
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:46,802
Onward! Onward!

742
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,726
Oh, let's get something to eat.

743
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,395
Make a left.

744
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:00,148
Okay.
Go here! No, Billy!

745
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,574
It's heavy.

746
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:05,411
No, push me this way.
Push me this way.

747
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:09,407
Lisa!
Lisa, come look at this.

748
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,163
He's drunk, and he's drinking beer.

749
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,666
Oh, he got a six-pack.

750
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,922
Push me.

751
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:22,553
Oh.

752
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,009
Hello?

753
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:27,759
- We'd like some food.
- Okay, what you need?

754
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,178
Chickens.

755
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:32,351
Chicken breast.

756
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:35,024
Any kind of breast.

757
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:39,362
- Sir, you need some help?
- Yes, I need some service!

758
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,189
Okay, well, you got to...
We'll get you served,

759
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,945
I need to push you over here.
We'll bring it out to you.

760
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:44,264
Need to get you away from here.

761
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:45,944
Let me push you over
to the side, okay?

762
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,530
Can you let go of the thing there?
I'll push you over to the side.

763
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:49,934
- Okay, but...
- What do you want?

764
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:53,122
- Do you guys serve beers?
- No, we don't serve beer.

765
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:56,626
- How about whiskey?
- Um, no, we don't have whiskey, either.

766
00:40:56,704 --> 00:41:00,208
Sir, what do you have
that's good in there for a hangover?

767
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:03,302
To eat? I mean, greasy
food is always good.

768
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:05,881
But a hangover? Sleep.
He got to sleep it off.

769
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:09,430
Man, that girl working
the window, she was nice-looking.

770
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,637
- She was nice-looking?
- Yeah.

771
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,101
Well, you just chill out
here for a minute.

772
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,397
We're gonna see
if we can get you some help.

773
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:20,445
Okay, we need some chickens
and a big side of poontang.

774
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:24,065
The poontang?
There's some inside.

775
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:27,159
Well, I want some to go.
Go hook that up.

776
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:29,655
He's stuck on Lisa.

777
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,410
That's what he want.

778
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:34,704
- Black bush gal?
- Lisa!

779
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:36,127
He said he wanted poontang.

780
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,746
He'll hook you up!

781
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:39,877
- What does he want?
- He wants you.

782
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:41,583
What? No, he don't.

783
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,009
Excuse me, honey.

784
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:45,837
That's what he's hollering.
That's what he wants, Lisa.

785
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,594
Honest to God, strike me dead.

786
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:51,009
He wants some black bush.

787
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:52,332
Lisa, that man is 80 years old.

788
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:55,438
I turned around and I said,
"Did he say what I thought he just said?"

789
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,186
You better go out there.

790
00:41:57,265 --> 00:42:00,235
He is 80 years old
in a shopping cart.

791
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,856
Cut the man a break.

792
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:14,870
Siempre avante.
Know what that means?

793
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:17,452
- No.
- Onward and forward.

794
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:23,462
You know, rubber on wheel
is faster than rubber on heel.

795
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,191
That's what Lightnin' Hopkins says.

796
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,712
- You know who Lightnin' Hopkins is?
- No.

797
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,969
What about Komodo dragons?
You know what those are?

798
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:32,221
No.

799
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:35,304
- You don't know who Johnny Cash is?
- No.

800
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,347
Ask me what the secret of comedy is.

801
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:40,442
- What is...
- Timing! Get it?

802
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:43,315
What?

803
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,401
That's not funny?
- No.

804
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:48,024
Ugh. Tough room.

805
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:53,746
I love this song!

806
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:59,369
Uh, you're kind of...

807
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:02,084
Weird.

808
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,187
Dirty bastard!

809
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:26,862
Oh...

810
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:31,777
You Okay?

811
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,361
Oh, God.

812
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:35,655
Oh...

813
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:39,375
- You all right, Grandpa?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

814
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,870
Caught me right in the puss!

815
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:44,627
You want some ice?
You need me to get some ice for you?

816
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:47,299
Yeah, maybe some ice.

817
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:50,049
My damn wife put these
in here and it...

818
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:51,637
Ow!

819
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:56,058
Did you see the tuchas on that one?

820
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:57,639
Ow!

821
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:05,605
- Should I get a basket?
- No. We ain't gonna need one.

822
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:13,948
- You like white bread?
- Yep.

823
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:15,699
Good.

824
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:21,960
- Um... What are you doing?
- Just go with it.

825
00:44:25,955 --> 00:44:28,299
Are we going to get in trouble for this?

826
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:30,964
No. If someone
says anything,

827
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:34,889
just tell them that your grandpa's old
and doesn't know what he's doing.

828
00:44:34,964 --> 00:44:37,558
- Ooh. You want turkey or ham?
- Ham.

829
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:39,226
Ham?

830
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:40,554
All right.

831
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:47,067
Here. Get you a lot.

832
00:44:47,143 --> 00:44:48,895
Let's get some damn mustard.

833
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:50,271
Here.

834
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:53,654
- That's a lot of mustard.
- Eat it!

835
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:00,323
Mmm.

836
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:06,254
So I eat it quick, so
we don't get caught.

837
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:11,422
- Sir.
- What's going on?

838
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,423
- What's going on?
- Yes.

839
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:15,254
You eating everything here.

840
00:45:15,338 --> 00:45:17,432
- You don't pay yet.
- Huh?

841
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:20,510
You eating things here in the store
and you don't pay yet.

842
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:23,145
- So he took that one.
- Please don't get mad.

843
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:25,273
Huh?
- He took this.

844
00:45:25,348 --> 00:45:26,691
- And you put it there.
- No.

845
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:29,940
- Yes, I saw. It's in the camera.
- No.

846
00:45:30,019 --> 00:45:31,441
Okay.

847
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,147
Please don't get mad at my grandpa.

848
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:35,108
He's old
and he doesn't know what he's doing.

849
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:36,534
What's going on?

850
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,615
- Where am I?
- You know what he's doing, baby.

851
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,784
You know what he doing
and you doing it with him.

852
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:42,615
Sometimes he shits himself.

853
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:45,121
- No. You took that one.
- And sometimes he sits in it like a baby.

854
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:48,421
I don't shit myself,
you little prick.

855
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:50,289
- Sometimes he pisses the bed.
- Okay, you opened these...

856
00:45:50,373 --> 00:45:53,172
- Do not!
- Do, too!

857
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:55,629
- Do not!
- You opened the ham and you don't pay.

858
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:56,883
- Can I have his...
- Close the doors.

859
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:58,055
I'm gonna call the police.

860
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:00,130
Can he have his chocolate
milk back, please, ma'am?

861
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,602
Ugh.

862
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:12,357
They won't notice a thing.

863
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,022
That's how it looks
most of the time anyway.

864
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:16,107
Come on. Come on.

865
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:19,281
Let's go quick.
Let's go quick.

866
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:21,367
Come on.
Let's go this way.

867
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:26,117
Oh! Uh...

868
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,543
Thank you!

869
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:29,708
Get the hats!
Get the hats!

870
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:32,457
Come on, come on!

871
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:33,712
Come on!

872
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:37,383
- What are y'all doing?
- Whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

873
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:39,304
- It was $3.99!
- Stop!

874
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,553
- Yeah. Come on!
- You're not going anywhere!

875
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:45,394
- Leave us alone! Leave us alone!
- No. You're not going anywhere.

876
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,813
Hey. Billy, get in!
Start it up!

877
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:49,390
They're going to
take that child away from you.

878
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:50,725
I wish they would!

879
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:52,815
- Get back inside!
- I'm sorry.

880
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:55,191
- Get your ass inside!
- Ma'am, I'm sorry.

881
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:56,898
You are sorry! You're sorry as hell!

882
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:59,734
- No, I'm not gonna...
- You're eating what you stole!

883
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:02,570
- What am I supposed to do with it?
- You buy it!

884
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,075
- You pay for it.
- If I had money, I would.

885
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:07,409
You had enough money to come in here
and the audacity to try to steal from me.

886
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:08,993
These are pretty good,
by the way.

887
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:11,556
I don't give a shit. I ought to
stuff it down your damn throat.

888
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,418
- You're very pretty when you're mad.
- You're pissing me off!

889
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,937
- You're very lovely when you're mad.
- You're pissing me off.

890
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:24,767
All right, come on.

891
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:31,106
Hi.

892
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,277
All right.

893
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,204
Okay.

894
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:46,826
Ow!

895
00:47:47,323 --> 00:47:49,417
I got her.

896
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:52,578
Ah, Jesus...

897
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:57,504
Here we go. Oh! Jesus.

898
00:47:58,042 --> 00:47:59,043
Oh my goodness.

899
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,753
It's all right.
She's already dead.

900
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:04,807
- What?
- Yeah, she died a few days ago.

901
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:08,477
We're just bringing her in
'cause it's respectful.

902
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,850
Don't want to leave her in the trunk.

903
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:12,807
All right.

904
00:48:12,932 --> 00:48:14,479
Oh! Get in there!

905
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:15,559
Oh, shit.

906
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:22,825
Grandpa's going out for a walk.
You stay in the room.

907
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:26,654
See you later, old man.

908
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:29,157
Stay in there, damn it.

909
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:31,083
My grandson.

910
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:36,297
Hey, you don't know where any, uh, like,
dance clubs or anything like that are?

911
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:39,633
Like, with lots of, uh, black ladies.

912
00:48:39,959 --> 00:48:41,961
Oh, there's one on, um...

913
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:44,468
Richard Boulevard.

914
00:48:44,547 --> 00:48:45,673
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

915
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:48,725
- I'm really fond of the black ladies.
- Yeah.

916
00:48:48,801 --> 00:48:52,305
Yeah. They used to call me
Jizzy Gillespie when I was younger.

917
00:48:52,388 --> 00:48:53,935
Oh. yeah?

918
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:57,310
Hey, get in the room!

919
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:36,391
Hello. How are you?

920
00:49:40,436 --> 00:49:41,562
Hello, ladies!

921
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:45,115
- Hey, grandpa, how you doing?
- Good! How you doing, baby?

922
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:46,363
All right!

923
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:51,614
Wow.

924
00:49:57,036 --> 00:49:58,288
Hi, sweetheart.

925
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:01,624
- Wow. You are nice-looking!
- Thank you!

926
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:04,551
Can I get a Colt 45, please?

927
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:33,452
He's got his jim dog out.

928
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:36,416
That thing's about like that!

929
00:50:42,957 --> 00:50:47,303
Hey, big boy! Is this one of
them stripteaser shows?

930
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,217
Yeah, it's males.

931
00:50:49,922 --> 00:50:54,598
That's perfect, because I like to catch
these women when they're soggy.

932
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:56,436
So you boys do a good job tonight,

933
00:50:56,512 --> 00:50:57,729
- all right?
- Okay.

934
00:50:57,805 --> 00:50:59,557
Get them all hot and bothered,

935
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,268
and I'm gonna try to swoop in
and get me a little.

936
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:03,523
Okay, Okay.

937
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:05,980
- Are you one of them dancers?
- Yeah, I am.

938
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:08,653
I bet you got a pretty
big Tootsie Roll, huh?

939
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,116
Man, what the fuck?

940
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,069
What?

941
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,247
Get the fuck away from me, man.

942
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:17,958
But I mean, if you're a dancer...

943
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:21,333
I'm sorry, I was just...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

944
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:26,296
How are you ladies doing down here?

945
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:29,128
- Fine. How are you?
- Good, good.

946
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:31,760
I came here alone,
so I'm sorry if I'm bothering you.

947
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:33,682
What made you come in here?

948
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:36,052
I don't... I was walking, uh,

949
00:51:36,135 --> 00:51:37,182
- down the street...
- Walking?

950
00:51:37,261 --> 00:51:38,934
You weren't walking nowhere!

951
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:41,557
What you gonna do,
watch it or watch us?

952
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,563
I came to watch you girls.

953
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:47,984
You ladies are gonna
get all worked up,

954
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:51,284
and then hopefully
old Irving can swoop in there.

955
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:54,486
- What's your name?
- Irving.

956
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:59,325
Maybe some of these ladies
will want a serving of Irving,

957
00:51:59,408 --> 00:52:00,660
if you know what I'm saying.

958
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,163
That's right. Thank you.
Thank you, mama!

959
00:52:04,413 --> 00:52:07,758
If you're ready for the
next entertainer, everybody say, "lam!"

960
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:09,585
I am!

961
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:13,430
I love chocolate!

962
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:16,925
He's harder than a horseshoe!

963
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:18,845
How hard are you?

964
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:22,268
I'm pretty loose right now,
but I could probably get it going.

965
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:24,767
We want to see yours.
We want you to walk the red carpet.

966
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:25,851
She wants to see mine?

967
00:52:26,352 --> 00:52:27,604
Walk the red carpet.

968
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:29,233
I'll show her mine right now!

969
00:52:29,313 --> 00:52:31,236
We're gonna make it rain.
Walk the red carpet.

970
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:33,989
I'm gonna go...
I'm going to walk the red carpet.

971
00:52:34,068 --> 00:52:35,866
Yeah, I'm gonna shake it!

972
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:45,245
I don't know
what the fuck is going on.

973
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:17,653
Oh, oh...

974
00:54:09,455 --> 00:54:10,672
What?

975
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:05,720
Excuse me?
Have you seen my grandpa?

976
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:07,145
Your grandpa?

977
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:09,890
I think he's lost.
He's kind of an idiot.

978
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,892
Why is he an idiot?

979
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,148
'Cause he's lost, duh.

980
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:15,486
Does he have a cell phone?

981
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:19,905
He's probably drunk right now.
He went to a strip club last night.

982
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:24,242
I don't know what to tell you, son.
Oh, gosh.

983
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:27,082
Excuse me? Excuse me?

984
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:30,085
Screw you.

985
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:38,760
- Who you looking for?
- I'm looking for my grandpa.

986
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:40,759
Your grandpa's not here.

987
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:44,183
- Is he in the Champagne Room?
- There's nobody in there.

988
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:46,097
- Let me check.
- No.

989
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:48,929
- Let me just go check.
- I told you.

990
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:52,599
He's, like, persistent.
He wants to go in there.

991
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:55,277
And he's talking about having
a great time in the Champagne Room

992
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:57,480
like he's, like, 21.

993
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:00,737
What's up?

994
00:56:00,816 --> 00:56:02,944
- Is this an adult bookstore?
- Yeah.

995
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:05,529
- Is my grandpa in here?
- No.

996
00:56:05,946 --> 00:56:07,414
Is there somebody, like...

997
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:09,366
Is somebody, like,
watching you or something?

998
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:10,450
No.

999
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:12,832
Did you get that shirt
at Tramps R Us?

1000
00:56:12,995 --> 00:56:14,042
What?

1001
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:15,998
Did you get that shirt
at Tramps R Us?

1002
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:17,708
- No.
- Oh.

1003
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,793
- How old are you?
- Eight.

1004
00:56:20,127 --> 00:56:22,129
- What's your name?
- Billy.

1005
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:23,722
When did you get here?

1006
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:25,720
You're asking a lot of
questions for a stripper.

1007
00:56:25,966 --> 00:56:27,809
- What's your stage name?
- What?

1008
00:56:27,885 --> 00:56:29,165
What's your stripper stage name?

1009
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,020
I don't have a stage name.
I'm not a stripper.

1010
00:56:31,138 --> 00:56:32,390
I'll just call you Cinnamon.

1011
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:33,815
- Cinnamon?
- What?

1012
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:36,815
- I look like a stripper?
- Yeah. In a good way.

1013
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:38,487
- In a good way?
- Oh, my...

1014
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:42,282
Why don't you wait on me
and I'm gonna come, like,

1015
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:43,825
take you to whatever
hotel you're at?

1016
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:45,573
You don't need to be out here
by yourself.

1017
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:47,495
You're gonna, like, get hurt.

1018
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:50,408
There's a bunch of crazy people
out here.

1019
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:53,081
Apparently, your
grandpa's one of them.

1020
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,083
Bye, Cinnamon. I got to go.

1021
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:57,335
No. And I'm not Cinnamon!

1022
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:04,675
- How you doing?
- Rough night.

1023
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:09,802
Grandpa! Where have you been?

1024
00:57:09,885 --> 00:57:11,933
Not now.

1025
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:13,855
I've been worried!

1026
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,795
What're we gonna do
with Grandma's body?

1027
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:39,464
I don't know, buddy.

1028
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:42,876
We met with someone to discuss that,

1029
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:47,215
but your grandma,
she wasn't very cooperative that day.

1030
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:52,387
Just said some nonsense about
throw her off a bridge for all she cares.

1031
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:04,239
You know what a woman likes?

1032
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:06,407
A new fishing rod?

1033
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,072
No.

1034
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:09,987
Magic!

1035
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:13,248
I can prove it.
You want to see?

1036
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:14,745
- Sure.
- All right.

1037
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:20,881
Hello, ma'am.
You wouldn't flatter an old man

1038
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:22,924
by watching him do a
magic trick, would you?

1039
00:58:24,418 --> 00:58:27,092
Oh... That's good.
All right, keep your eye on the...

1040
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:30,095
I'm going to make it disappear.

1041
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:33,434
No charge, either.

1042
00:58:33,802 --> 00:58:36,931
Okay.
'Cause I don't have any money.

1043
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,182
There we go!
Where'd it go?

1044
00:58:39,433 --> 00:58:40,776
- In your sleeve?
- No.

1045
00:58:41,018 --> 00:58:42,691
- What's that on your thumb?
- What?

1046
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:45,443
- Look.
- Will you give me that?

1047
00:58:46,023 --> 00:58:47,195
Ah.

1048
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:49,902
Why don't you beat it?
- But I want to stay with you.

1049
00:58:49,985 --> 00:58:51,328
Why don't you beat it?

1050
00:58:52,279 --> 00:58:55,283
Grandpa's got to
talk to some tail.

1051
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:57,246
He's...

1052
00:58:57,617 --> 00:59:00,621
He's a little cooter
stretcher is what he is.

1053
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:03,624
You, uh, from this town?

1054
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:05,463
Yeah. Born and raised.

1055
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:08,045
Born and raised.
You're awful pretty. My goodness!

1056
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:09,220
Thank you.

1057
00:59:09,463 --> 00:59:12,637
A beautiful young lady like yourself,
I have something for you.

1058
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:14,135
Oh, Lordy.

1059
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:17,562
Here we go.
You're so kind.

1060
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:19,230
- There you go.
- Thank you.

1061
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:22,480
Those are for you.
They're specially scented.

1062
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:23,731
I bet.

1063
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:26,651
You got time for an old man like me,
maybe?

1064
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:30,701
We can blow this garmooshky
and go chase around a little.

1065
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:32,445
Not tonight I don't.

1066
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:33,991
- Not tonight?
- No.

1067
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:37,908
You on a lunch break?

1068
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:40,414
Yeah.

1069
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:42,622
- You married?
- Oh, yeah.

1070
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:44,831
Oh, boy.
"Married" married?

1071
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:48,928
"Married" married to a
gun-toting police officer.

1072
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:52,006
- Oh, God! Of all the luck.
- There you go.

1073
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:56,809
- All right, good times.
- See ya.

1074
00:59:56,885 --> 00:59:57,886
Bye.

1075
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:00,389
If I had all the money
I spent on poontang,

1076
01:00:00,472 --> 01:00:01,940
you know what I'd do with it?

1077
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:04,143
- What?
- Spend it on poontang.

1078
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:10,528
One, two, three, four,
I declare a thumb war.

1079
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:14,741
One, two, three,

1080
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:17,118
four, five, six,

1081
01:00:17,531 --> 01:00:18,874
seven, eight...

1082
01:00:19,116 --> 01:00:20,743
Come on, you're a lefty.
You can be stronger than that.

1083
01:00:20,826 --> 01:00:22,794
I'm trying.
I'm trying. I'm trying.

1084
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:25,793
It's because you're holding
it so close to the edge.

1085
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:27,294
- Hello.
- Hi.

1086
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:30,253
- I see you have met my grandson.
- Yeah.

1087
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:33,884
- Oh. My name is Irving. Oh.
- I'm Lisa.

1088
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:35,557
What was your name...

1089
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,350
She's American.
You don't have to bow.

1090
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:39,143
What?
- You have a weird grandpa.

1091
01:00:40,387 --> 01:00:41,730
Where'd you go?

1092
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:45,397
You told me to beat it 'cause you
were gonna talk to some tail.

1093
01:00:45,934 --> 01:00:47,652
Oh...

1094
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:49,813
I said I... To...

1095
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:53,575
I was going to beat it
to go deliver some mail.

1096
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,243
Oh, jeez.

1097
01:00:55,569 --> 01:00:57,913
You are hotter than a
Puerto Rican picnic.

1098
01:00:57,988 --> 01:00:59,831
Oh, my God, thank you!

1099
01:01:01,408 --> 01:01:02,928
- Thank you so much.
- Oh, my goodness!

1100
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:06,080
- You babysit big boys?
- I do, yeah.

1101
01:01:06,413 --> 01:01:07,835
I mean big boys like me.

1102
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:09,128
Oh. No.

1103
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:11,756
- No?
- Definitely not.

1104
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:13,428
Oh, well.

1105
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:15,755
You win some,
you lose some, kid.

1106
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:19,096
- Nice to meet you! Wow!
- See you. Bye-bye.

1107
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:21,349
Goodbye.

1108
01:01:21,428 --> 01:01:24,352
That was
a slower no than I usually get.

1109
01:01:24,431 --> 01:01:26,775
You may be useful after all!

1110
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:28,944
You ever play charades?

1111
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:30,528
Oh, oh...

1112
01:01:32,272 --> 01:01:33,444
Excuse me?

1113
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:37,870
My grandpa can't talk that well,
but he says you're very beautiful.

1114
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:39,530
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1115
01:01:45,285 --> 01:01:47,003
Uh... Okay. I need to go.

1116
01:01:47,204 --> 01:01:49,377
I need to go. Oh, my God.

1117
01:01:49,456 --> 01:01:51,458
Grandpa wants to know
if you're married!

1118
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:54,802
Excuse me, my grandpa
would like to say something.

1119
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:06,894
He wants to know if
you want to smell his finger.

1120
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:09,772
No, no. No, no, no. No, no. No, no.

1121
01:02:11,228 --> 01:02:13,651
He wants to know if
you're doing anything later.

1122
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:16,358
Takes an old
hen to deliver the goods.

1123
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:19,406
Is that a no?

1124
01:02:19,486 --> 01:02:22,490
- Is that a no?
- Old chickens make good soup.

1125
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:24,074
Um.

1126
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:31,794
My grandpa can't talk that well,
but he says you're very beautiful.

1127
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:33,833
Hmm.

1128
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:37,261
How do you know that's
what he said?

1129
01:02:47,347 --> 01:02:48,519
What did he say?

1130
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:51,021
He says you make him
feel young again.

1131
01:02:51,101 --> 01:02:52,353
Mmm. Mmm.

1132
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:55,042
Do you know what he's saying,
or are you just making stuff up?

1133
01:02:55,522 --> 01:02:56,944
I know what he's saying.

1134
01:02:57,274 --> 01:03:00,528
- Does he seem crazy to you sometime?
- Yeah.

1135
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:02,370
Excuse me!

1136
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:03,446
Okay.

1137
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:10,705
He wants to know where we
can get a hoagie around here.

1138
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:12,710
A hoagie sandwich.

1139
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:14,541
Um...

1140
01:03:17,377 --> 01:03:18,879
Hoagie sandwich.

1141
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,097
Excuse me.

1142
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:29,894
He says you look like a nice Jew.

1143
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:33,602
No, no, no, no...

1144
01:03:36,313 --> 01:03:38,361
Oh, he says you have
very nice shoes.

1145
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:41,443
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah, nice.

1146
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:43,903
Oh, we're just, uh...

1147
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:45,910
We're just, uh, clowning around.

1148
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:49,368
I'm trying to teach him
how to hit on women.

1149
01:03:49,451 --> 01:03:52,796
Oh, okay.
I can kind of see what was going on.

1150
01:03:52,871 --> 01:03:54,544
- How did he do?
- You did very good.

1151
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:56,837
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1152
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:59,385
- He's sweet. He's my grandson.
- Okay.

1153
01:03:59,461 --> 01:04:00,508
Yes.

1154
01:04:00,587 --> 01:04:04,933
He goes to bed around 8:00 p.m. or so.
So, uh...

1155
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:08,265
After that,
I'm pretty much free.

1156
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:11,439
No, I'm not...
I'm not in the market right now.

1157
01:04:11,765 --> 01:04:13,108
You know, I...

1158
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:17,730
I might be too old to stir the gravy,
but I can still lick the spoon,

1159
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:19,655
that's for damn sure.

1160
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:21,278
Well, good luck.

1161
01:04:21,441 --> 01:04:22,784
Oh. All right.

1162
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:24,327
- We'll be right here.
- Okay.

1163
01:04:24,611 --> 01:04:26,113
All right, sweetie.

1164
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:30,325
Good job, buddy.

1165
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:38,084
- Have you kissed a girl yet?
- Yeah.

1166
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:40,964
- Was she your girlfriend?
- Yeah.

1167
01:04:41,044 --> 01:04:43,172
- How long did you go out with her?
- A day.

1168
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:45,256
A day...

1169
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:46,599
A day?

1170
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,303
That sounds like
some of my relationships.

1171
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:51,563
Grandpa!

1172
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:53,139
Whoa!

1173
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:55,434
Get that damn thing out of the way!

1174
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:05,030
Jesus Christ!

1175
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:07,909
Why would you put a penguin
right in my driving spot?

1176
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:10,164
In your... Sir, there's a curb there.

1177
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,601
The driveways are there and there.

1178
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:14,244
Look, lady, get off my back!

1179
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:16,208
I'm an old man.

1180
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:18,506
What happened to
"the customer's always right"?

1181
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:21,168
Yeah, but you ain't right
about running over the penguin.

1182
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:23,595
Why would they
put the penguin in my spot?

1183
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:26,844
- You ran over the penguin.
- You put a penguin in my spot!

1184
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:30,097
You ran over the penguin!
What are you talking about?

1185
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:31,765
Well, you don't have to yell at me.

1186
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:33,103
Can I get out?

1187
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:34,848
Stay in the car, Billy.

1188
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:37,267
And watch this.

1189
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:40,399
You can't... Look, buddy.
You're not going anywhere.

1190
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:42,196
You're fixing the thing.
That's all I'm telling you.

1191
01:05:42,272 --> 01:05:43,615
Oh, I'm going to eat.

1192
01:05:43,815 --> 01:05:45,158
You're not going anywhere.

1193
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:48,032
- Watch out for the penguin, sir!
- No, I see it.

1194
01:05:48,111 --> 01:05:49,454
You already hit the penguin.

1195
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:52,623
Listen to me, you're going
to fix that penguin, bro.

1196
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:56,206
Whether you like it or not,
believe me, you're gonna fix it.

1197
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:57,287
Nope.

1198
01:05:59,247 --> 01:06:02,091
I mean, if I was fixing it,
you'd see me fixing it, but...

1199
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:04,840
I'm not fixing it.

1200
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:16,060
Did you notice how
I wasn't fixing it?

1201
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:18,691
- I'm about to bust your ass.
- Over a penguin?

1202
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:26,408
Fucking leave the
penguin alone, bro.

1203
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:33,657
I'm about to whip you, motherfucker.
Up your ass, bro.

1204
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:36,994
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna get your doober.

1205
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:39,295
Oh. Oh. I got your doober.

1206
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:41,630
I got your doober.

1207
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:42,673
I ate your doober.

1208
01:06:42,749 --> 01:06:43,750
You shouldn't be fucking
driving anyway.

1209
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,710
- You're fucking 85 years old.
- I got his doober.

1210
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:48,717
- Thank God that wasn't a human being.
- I got his doober and he's mad.

1211
01:06:48,796 --> 01:06:51,094
Okay, I'm gonna fucking...

1212
01:06:52,175 --> 01:06:53,677
Oh!

1213
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,309
Atomic elbow!
Atomic elbow!

1214
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:58,481
I did a little wrestling
myself in my younger days.

1215
01:06:58,556 --> 01:06:59,603
Are you fucking kidding me, bro?

1216
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:01,525
What? Atomic elbow!

1217
01:07:01,601 --> 01:07:02,853
Are you kidding me?

1218
01:07:02,936 --> 01:07:05,530
I loved Abdullah the Butcher
when I was younger.

1219
01:07:05,605 --> 01:07:07,073
Are you fucking kidding me, man?

1220
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:09,776
Why? It's an atomic elbow.

1221
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:17,116
Wow.

1222
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:19,786
That looks like
the camel toe in your pants!

1223
01:07:20,537 --> 01:07:21,538
Hoo-hah!

1224
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:24,753
Get it? I said you had a vagina.

1225
01:07:24,832 --> 01:07:26,505
That's a vagina reference.

1226
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:29,466
You're gonna fix this fucking penguin,
whether you like it or not.

1227
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:31,139
- You understand?
- One second. I'm gonna say it...

1228
01:07:31,214 --> 01:07:32,636
Am not, am not!

1229
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:34,847
- You're gonna fix this fucking thing.
- Nope, nope.

1230
01:07:34,968 --> 01:07:37,812
You gotta ask yourself,
"What leverage do I have?"

1231
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:40,523
Not much!

1232
01:07:40,682 --> 01:07:43,356
You're a fucking jerkoff,
you know that?

1233
01:07:45,353 --> 01:07:47,833
- "You're gonna fix that penguin!"
- "No, you're gonna fix it!"

1234
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:50,241
- "You're gonna fix it!"
- "No, you're gonna!"

1235
01:07:51,526 --> 01:07:54,245
- Table for two?
- Yeah.

1236
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:55,864
Okay. Right this way.

1237
01:07:55,989 --> 01:07:57,991
I'd like to fix her penguin.

1238
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:00,668
Want to see how red
I can get my face?

1239
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:02,495
Yeah.

1240
01:08:08,876 --> 01:08:10,719
Oh, stop, stop, stop!

1241
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:15,676
Oh, my God.
That was redder than an ape's ass.

1242
01:08:17,885 --> 01:08:20,058
- Watch your mouth.
- Oh, sorry.

1243
01:08:20,388 --> 01:08:22,231
That was redder than
an ape's tuchas.

1244
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:29,071
Do you like a lot of milk?

1245
01:08:29,397 --> 01:08:31,240
Oh, boy, do I!

1246
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:35,244
I like chocolate
milk sometimes.

1247
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:37,368
Yeah, Grandpa's got
a taste for that, too.

1248
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:38,448
Yeah.

1249
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:41,038
He used to have a big taste for it.

1250
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:44,086
Why doesn't my mom like me?

1251
01:08:47,582 --> 01:08:49,084
Your mom likes you, buddy.

1252
01:08:49,751 --> 01:08:51,924
Then Why'd she run away from me?

1253
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:53,254
Well...

1254
01:08:54,922 --> 01:08:57,550
Mom's got to go away
for a little bit,

1255
01:08:57,634 --> 01:09:02,105
and so I'm taking you to your dad
so he can look after you.

1256
01:09:04,766 --> 01:09:06,894
But I don't really like my dad.

1257
01:09:08,436 --> 01:09:10,609
Yeah, I don't like him much either,
buddy.

1258
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:16,160
- Angel.
- Yes.

1259
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:17,828
Earplugs, Billy.

1260
01:09:17,904 --> 01:09:19,827
Earplugs.

1261
01:09:19,906 --> 01:09:21,499
What time do you get off?

1262
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:24,453
- 9:00 o'clock.
- All right.

1263
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:27,038
- All right.
- All right.

1264
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:30,591
Check out the rear
bumpers on that one.

1265
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:31,668
Mmm.

1266
01:09:32,085 --> 01:09:34,338
- How's your food?
- Good.

1267
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:36,514
How much butter you
gonna put on that?

1268
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:38,011
I'm eating this one.

1269
01:09:38,925 --> 01:09:41,553
- You eat it raw?
- Yeah, why not?

1270
01:09:41,636 --> 01:09:43,434
Dear God.

1271
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:46,641
I think

1272
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:49,728
all this bacon is
getting to Grandpa.

1273
01:10:02,407 --> 01:10:05,411
Did you just toot, Grandpa?

1274
01:10:05,493 --> 01:10:07,336
That was a church house creeper.

1275
01:10:07,578 --> 01:10:08,750
I think I got one.

1276
01:10:12,959 --> 01:10:14,961
I think you need to
clean out your shorts.

1277
01:10:18,089 --> 01:10:19,432
Beat that.

1278
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:21,759
Grandpa's tummy's hurting.

1279
01:10:22,093 --> 01:10:23,390
Let it out.

1280
01:10:26,264 --> 01:10:28,437
Try this one on for size.

1281
01:10:37,275 --> 01:10:39,369
- Oh, God.
- Ew, Grandpa, you sharted!

1282
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:42,363
I'm so sorry.

1283
01:10:42,447 --> 01:10:43,448
Are you okay?

1284
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:44,665
Oh, my...

1285
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:46,955
Oh, my God.

1286
01:10:47,285 --> 01:10:50,630
I'm sorry, ladies.
Don't look back there. I'm so sorry.

1287
01:10:52,707 --> 01:10:54,209
Oh, God, that's...

1288
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:00,802
Let's go, buddy.

1289
01:11:01,466 --> 01:11:02,467
Oh, no.

1290
01:11:05,803 --> 01:11:10,058
That guy stood up on the chair part
and pooped on the wall.

1291
01:11:10,141 --> 01:11:11,984
- He what?
- And he pooped on the wall.

1292
01:11:19,567 --> 01:11:22,787
Oh, good shot. Good...
Take it again. Take it again.

1293
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:26,624
Oh, Jesus.

1294
01:11:29,494 --> 01:11:31,997
All right.
You want some of this?

1295
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:34,833
Why can't I just stay with you
instead of my dad?

1296
01:11:35,166 --> 01:11:38,261
- 'Cause that's not the plan.
- We can change the plan.

1297
01:11:46,511 --> 01:11:51,938
How about this? If I make this shot, I
get to stay with you instead of my dad.

1298
01:11:52,016 --> 01:11:53,017
All right.

1299
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:56,858
Get that out of here!

1300
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:05,784
How about we become tuna
fishermen and then move to Japan?

1301
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:07,532
Oh, boy.

1302
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:13,880
We'll get a fish market and then we sell
all tuna and we'll be billionaires.

1303
01:12:14,205 --> 01:12:17,300
There is lots of tuna in Japan,
that's for sure!

1304
01:12:18,125 --> 01:12:21,220
That's the best idea
I heard in years, son.

1305
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:27,055
Do you like to fish, old man?

1306
01:12:27,718 --> 01:12:31,564
I used to like to fish a lot,
but that was before.

1307
01:12:31,889 --> 01:12:33,391
Before what?

1308
01:12:35,893 --> 01:12:40,899
Before a dark day when I caught
my very own Moby Dick.

1309
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:48,080
Whoa!

1310
01:12:48,573 --> 01:12:49,745
Jesus!

1311
01:12:54,412 --> 01:12:55,538
Whoo!

1312
01:12:56,414 --> 01:12:57,586
Shit!

1313
01:12:58,416 --> 01:13:00,418
Oh, Lordy! Lordy!

1314
01:13:06,924 --> 01:13:08,267
A little help!

1315
01:13:11,262 --> 01:13:12,263
Oh, man!

1316
01:13:14,265 --> 01:13:16,438
Check out the nine
iron on this one.

1317
01:13:16,934 --> 01:13:18,732
Oh! Oh, God.

1318
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:20,279
Oh, shit.

1319
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:22,865
What is that? What is that?

1320
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:26,160
It's a large-nose carpet croaker!

1321
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:27,782
Yeah. Okay.

1322
01:13:36,579 --> 01:13:38,172
He's got his dick in his mouth!

1323
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:44,132
After that,
I never ate fish sticks again.

1324
01:13:47,298 --> 01:13:48,641
Grandpa, I'm hungry.

1325
01:13:48,883 --> 01:13:51,887
You know what?
I may have a solution.

1326
01:14:00,728 --> 01:14:03,572
- Are you sure this is a good idea?
- Of course it is.

1327
01:14:03,648 --> 01:14:06,993
You can get away with most
anything, all you got to do is try.

1328
01:14:07,318 --> 01:14:08,820
Follow my lead.

1329
01:14:17,161 --> 01:14:19,914
Okay, folks, can we get a
picture here with everyone?

1330
01:14:19,997 --> 01:14:23,171
Can everybody back up
on this side just a little bit?

1331
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:25,002
Just kinda take a couple steps back.

1332
01:14:26,504 --> 01:14:29,007
Keep going, just a little bit more.

1333
01:14:30,508 --> 01:14:31,976
Look at this.

1334
01:14:32,677 --> 01:14:34,679
This is lovely!

1335
01:14:35,513 --> 01:14:36,685
Wow.

1336
01:14:39,684 --> 01:14:42,028
- Look at that. It's pretty, right?
- Yeah.

1337
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:43,862
Sir,
can you back up out of the way?

1338
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,698
I'm trying to take a picture.

1339
01:14:47,858 --> 01:14:49,531
Oh, oh! oh!

1340
01:14:55,449 --> 01:14:57,543
- Help him!
- Are you okay, Grandpa?

1341
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:03,833
Ow!

1342
01:15:05,418 --> 01:15:06,920
Oh, my God!

1343
01:15:08,379 --> 01:15:09,801
Should we call 911?

1344
01:15:10,047 --> 01:15:11,469
Who pushed me?

1345
01:15:11,882 --> 01:15:13,725
I don't know.
I think you just fell.

1346
01:15:15,052 --> 01:15:16,395
Mmm.

1347
01:15:30,735 --> 01:15:32,737
Here.
Got you some breakfast.

1348
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:34,413
Sweet!

1349
01:15:34,905 --> 01:15:35,906
All right.

1350
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:47,551
- Hmm. What's today?
- Saturday.

1351
01:15:48,753 --> 01:15:51,006
Bet we could've
stirred up some trouble here.

1352
01:15:52,006 --> 01:15:55,510
Damn shame I got to
drop you at your dad's tomorrow.

1353
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:58,684
Oh, the hell with it!
Let's go have some fun.

1354
01:16:04,101 --> 01:16:06,274
Would you like to see a magic trick?

1355
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:09,194
I need a $20 bill as a prop.

1356
01:16:09,273 --> 01:16:11,025
And I'll give it right back to you.

1357
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:14,578
Allakazoo, allakastid...

1358
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:17,953
Grab the stuff...
Let's beat it, kid!

1359
01:16:18,532 --> 01:16:19,875
Come on! Come on!

1360
01:16:20,117 --> 01:16:22,461
What are you doing?
What are you waiting on? Come on!

1361
01:16:24,121 --> 01:16:27,796
- Grandpa, the car!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1362
01:16:31,796 --> 01:16:33,798
Have a sip of beer with Grandpa.

1363
01:16:35,758 --> 01:16:37,601
Whoa.

1364
01:16:39,804 --> 01:16:41,556
'Cause he should not be drinking.

1365
01:16:41,972 --> 01:16:43,974
Grandpa, I'm fucking wasted.

1366
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:50,148
- Whoops!
- What the hell was that?

1367
01:16:53,651 --> 01:16:55,574
You little cooter stretcher!

1368
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:56,787
No!

1369
01:16:56,862 --> 01:16:59,285
Wedgie, wedgie!

1370
01:17:06,497 --> 01:17:08,170
What's on your shirt?

1371
01:17:11,669 --> 01:17:13,137
Damn it. Ah...

1372
01:17:14,004 --> 01:17:17,759
Okay, my little wingman, why don't
you take the big bed tonight?

1373
01:17:17,842 --> 01:17:19,469
- You deserve it.
- Thank you, Grandpa!

1374
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:25,524
Settle down, now.
We got to get some sleep.

1375
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:27,439
We got Raleigh tomorrow.

1376
01:17:28,686 --> 01:17:30,188
Night, Billy.

1377
01:17:30,521 --> 01:17:34,526
- Grandpa, can we go fishing tomorrow?
- Maybe.

1378
01:17:34,859 --> 01:17:36,031
Promise?

1379
01:17:37,361 --> 01:17:39,614
Sure, I promise maybe.

1380
01:17:41,532 --> 01:17:43,876
Oh, I think I hear a flock of geese!

1381
01:17:46,871 --> 01:17:49,499
Oh, my God,
I think I just shit myself.

1382
01:17:55,379 --> 01:17:56,722
Good night, buddy.

1383
01:18:22,907 --> 01:18:25,410
I don't want to go to
my dad, though.

1384
01:18:26,493 --> 01:18:28,166
Well, I...

1385
01:18:28,245 --> 01:18:32,671
You got to. I can't keep you.

1386
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:36,921
I just can't
do anything with you right now.

1387
01:18:38,756 --> 01:18:42,932
But I'm sure your father
will, uh, do the right thing.

1388
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:46,848
My son's grandfather
is dropping him off.

1389
01:18:47,097 --> 01:18:49,099
I ain't seen the boy
in three or four years.

1390
01:18:49,183 --> 01:18:50,560
- So, you know... Yeah.
- Really?

1391
01:18:50,684 --> 01:18:52,732
She took him away from me, okay,

1392
01:18:52,811 --> 01:18:55,109
'cause so she could get, you know,
whatever, 'cause she got mad at me.

1393
01:18:55,189 --> 01:18:57,362
Child support.
Child support'll kill you.

1394
01:18:57,441 --> 01:19:00,945
Guess what? Now I'm getting
the child support.

1395
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:02,529
You got any speed?

1396
01:19:09,703 --> 01:19:11,376
- Hey, man. How you doing?
- Hey, man.

1397
01:19:11,622 --> 01:19:13,295
- I'm Chuck.
- I'm Patrick.

1398
01:19:13,415 --> 01:19:14,462
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1399
01:19:14,541 --> 01:19:16,214
Hey, what's that...

1400
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:17,795
- Oh, fuck, man.
- What's that, man?

1401
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,922
What's up with the "GOC"?
What's that, man?

1402
01:19:20,005 --> 01:19:21,552
Guardians of the Children, man.

1403
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,017
Oh.

1404
01:19:24,718 --> 01:19:26,470
That's what G.O.C. stands for.

1405
01:19:27,972 --> 01:19:30,475
No shit.
Well, what does that mean?

1406
01:19:31,558 --> 01:19:32,559
We're a...

1407
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:34,562
biker organization...

1408
01:19:34,812 --> 01:19:36,155
Organization, huh?

1409
01:19:36,647 --> 01:19:39,025
And we, we help abused kids, man.

1410
01:19:39,483 --> 01:19:40,655
Come on.

1411
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:51,753
There's the old prick right now.

1412
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:53,831
It's about time.

1413
01:19:54,498 --> 01:19:55,841
You get lost?

1414
01:19:56,667 --> 01:19:57,839
Hey, Chuck.

1415
01:19:58,085 --> 01:19:59,257
Irving.

1416
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:03,846
Hey, buddy. How you doing, billy goat?
You want to give me a hug?

1417
01:20:05,009 --> 01:20:06,932
- Don't be afraid of me.
- Hey.

1418
01:20:07,011 --> 01:20:09,855
I know we had our
differences in the past,

1419
01:20:10,848 --> 01:20:14,853
but I'm gonna ask you right now
to please take care of this boy.

1420
01:20:14,935 --> 01:20:16,107
He's all I have left.

1421
01:20:17,021 --> 01:20:19,900
Don't come at me
like I'm some kind of asshole.

1422
01:20:19,982 --> 01:20:21,325
Of course
I'm gonna take care of the little shit.

1423
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:23,073
- He's my kid.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1424
01:20:23,152 --> 01:20:24,699
Just take it down, all right?

1425
01:20:25,863 --> 01:20:29,538
Just surprise me and don't be
a schmuck this time, okay?

1426
01:20:30,534 --> 01:20:31,581
We're all good.

1427
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:33,833
Come here.
Come here, buddy.

1428
01:20:36,081 --> 01:20:39,301
You be a good boy, okay?
All right?

1429
01:20:39,877 --> 01:20:43,051
I'm going to be checking
in on you a lot.

1430
01:20:43,547 --> 01:20:47,893
And I'm gonna get word to your mom
that you're with your father now.

1431
01:20:48,886 --> 01:20:51,890
And I'm gonna tell her
all the fun we had,

1432
01:20:52,222 --> 01:20:54,224
and all the cool things
you showed me.

1433
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:57,394
Grandpa loves you very much.

1434
01:20:57,895 --> 01:20:59,317
Love you, too.

1435
01:21:02,024 --> 01:21:03,025
Good-bye, son.

1436
01:21:03,317 --> 01:21:04,819
Bye, old man.

1437
01:21:10,491 --> 01:21:11,834
Come on, Billy.

1438
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:13,831
That's enough of that horseshit.

1439
01:21:14,244 --> 01:21:16,747
- Hop up here. There you go.
- Get up here, little man.

1440
01:21:16,914 --> 01:21:18,086
Excuse me.

1441
01:21:20,334 --> 01:21:21,381
Just sit up here.

1442
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:24,464
Here, take this bag off.
You don't need this.

1443
01:21:37,393 --> 01:21:38,360
How ya doing?

1444
01:21:38,435 --> 01:21:39,436
Yes, sir.

1445
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,272
We're the Guardians of the Children...

1446
01:21:41,647 --> 01:21:43,024
and we take care of kids...

1447
01:21:43,107 --> 01:21:44,074
That's good.

1448
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:46,493
And as long as this boy and
this feller's in there...

1449
01:21:46,777 --> 01:21:48,745
that child will be took care of.

1450
01:21:48,821 --> 01:21:50,289
Thank you very much.
I, uh...

1451
01:21:50,364 --> 01:21:51,365
Don't worry about that.

1452
01:21:51,448 --> 01:21:54,372
I'm his grandfather and unfortunately
I have to hand him back now.

1453
01:21:54,535 --> 01:21:55,787
I can see the concern.

1454
01:21:57,496 --> 01:21:59,169
I don't trust him.

1455
01:21:59,623 --> 01:22:01,876
How long does he get
to keep the child?

1456
01:22:01,959 --> 01:22:03,802
Until his mom gets out of jail.

1457
01:22:04,461 --> 01:22:06,134
I'm sorry, sir,
I can't talk about it.

1458
01:22:06,547 --> 01:22:08,424
I understand.
Have a good day.

1459
01:22:08,507 --> 01:22:09,850
Please watch him!

1460
01:22:10,134 --> 01:22:11,636
We'll take good care of him.

1461
01:22:26,692 --> 01:22:27,972
What's your name, little feller?

1462
01:22:28,902 --> 01:22:29,949
What's your name?

1463
01:22:30,195 --> 01:22:31,367
Billy.

1464
01:22:31,572 --> 01:22:32,915
Billy, I'm Rick.

1465
01:22:32,990 --> 01:22:33,991
Hi, Rick.

1466
01:22:34,074 --> 01:22:35,326
Nice to meet you, Billy.

1467
01:22:35,409 --> 01:22:37,207
Dad, can we get some food?

1468
01:22:37,327 --> 01:22:39,421
I'll tell you what,
you can have a water.

1469
01:22:40,038 --> 01:22:42,336
Do you want a chicken
wing for the road?

1470
01:22:43,167 --> 01:22:45,010
Please, Dad, I'm hungry.

1471
01:22:45,878 --> 01:22:47,551
You don't need to eat that. You're...

1472
01:22:48,714 --> 01:22:50,637
No, don't give him that.

1473
01:22:50,716 --> 01:22:52,309
I mean, he needs to
lose some weight.

1474
01:22:52,384 --> 01:22:53,431
I mean, honestly.

1475
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:54,602
A chicken leg ain't
gonna hurt him.

1476
01:22:54,678 --> 01:22:55,679
Thank you.

1477
01:22:59,516 --> 01:23:01,644
Will you watch the little fat boy?
I gotta go take a piss.

1478
01:23:01,727 --> 01:23:02,853
Don't call him that.

1479
01:24:06,124 --> 01:24:07,501
When someone disrespects me,

1480
01:24:07,584 --> 01:24:10,383
I wanna be able to go,
like, "DT, take him out."

1481
01:24:10,462 --> 01:24:11,679
Yeah, no. We're not that.

1482
01:24:11,755 --> 01:24:14,053
"DT, see that..."

1483
01:24:14,132 --> 01:24:16,351
Look at that that guy
eyeballing me over there.

1484
01:24:16,426 --> 01:24:19,930
Listen, if I start some shit right
now, will you guys back me up?

1485
01:24:20,013 --> 01:24:21,481
'Cause this guy's
been eyeballing me all...

1486
01:24:21,557 --> 01:24:23,605
No, no, you're on your own.

1487
01:24:23,684 --> 01:24:24,901
We're here having a party.

1488
01:24:24,977 --> 01:24:26,729
That's all we are.

1489
01:24:26,812 --> 01:24:28,109
Yeah, damn.

1490
01:24:28,188 --> 01:24:30,316
That's what we're about, so...

1491
01:24:34,027 --> 01:24:35,028
Billy.

1492
01:24:35,821 --> 01:24:37,414
Let's go fishing.

1493
01:24:38,448 --> 01:24:39,995
Let's go fishing, buddy.

1494
01:24:40,951 --> 01:24:42,248
What are you doing back here?

1495
01:24:42,327 --> 01:24:43,670
- He's going with me.
- Can we?

1496
01:24:43,954 --> 01:24:45,581
Yeah, you're coming with me.

1497
01:24:45,664 --> 01:24:46,631
Yeah, I don't want you with him,
all right?

1498
01:24:46,707 --> 01:24:47,754
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

1499
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:49,050
No, no.
Don't put your hands on him.

1500
01:24:49,126 --> 01:24:51,549
That's my son. I can put my
hand on him if I want to.

1501
01:24:51,670 --> 01:24:53,092
No, don't touch him.
You are his...

1502
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:54,388
- You are a son of a bitch.
- I am his family.

1503
01:24:54,506 --> 01:24:55,632
You've been no father.

1504
01:24:55,716 --> 01:24:57,218
- Oh, yeah? Really?
- Yeah.

1505
01:24:57,301 --> 01:24:58,553
Come on, Billy.
Let's go.

1506
01:24:58,635 --> 01:25:00,012
Just stay right there!
Don't listen...

1507
01:25:00,095 --> 01:25:01,768
Hey, he's staying right here.

1508
01:25:01,847 --> 01:25:03,690
Come here, buddy.
- No, no, no. He's staying here.

1509
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:04,933
- Back off!
- You back off!

1510
01:25:05,017 --> 01:25:07,520
He's not going with you.
He's coming with me.

1511
01:25:07,853 --> 01:25:09,776
- Do you understand?
- No, no, no.

1512
01:25:09,855 --> 01:25:11,573
- He's coming with...
- This is my meal ticket.

1513
01:25:11,648 --> 01:25:13,241
You're not fit to have him.

1514
01:25:13,358 --> 01:25:14,919
- I'm not fit?
- Yeah, you're not fit...

1515
01:25:14,985 --> 01:25:16,953
I'm not fit?
I'll fucking kick your ass!

1516
01:25:17,029 --> 01:25:19,123
- Get out of my face!
- All right, all right!

1517
01:25:20,866 --> 01:25:21,913
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1518
01:25:21,992 --> 01:25:23,665
- I'll kill you!
- Easy. Easy.

1519
01:25:23,744 --> 01:25:25,246
Settle the hell down, man!

1520
01:25:25,704 --> 01:25:26,956
You ain't going nowhere, buddy.
Stop it.

1521
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:28,882
You better let go of me, boy.

1522
01:25:29,207 --> 01:25:30,754
- Let me get his bag.
- Take your grandson.

1523
01:25:30,834 --> 01:25:33,212
- Where's my grandson's backpack?
- Okay. He's okay.

1524
01:25:33,378 --> 01:25:34,880
I can't hack it with him!

1525
01:25:35,047 --> 01:25:37,550
There goes my 600 bucks!

1526
01:25:37,758 --> 01:25:39,010
What are you
talking about, man?

1527
01:25:39,092 --> 01:25:41,766
That kid is my 600 bucks a month!

1528
01:25:41,887 --> 01:25:43,230
Come back here!

1529
01:25:43,722 --> 01:25:45,645
Let me tell you something,
he's more than money.

1530
01:25:45,724 --> 01:25:47,226
He's a hell of a lot
more than money.

1531
01:25:47,309 --> 01:25:48,310
You hear what I'm saying?

1532
01:25:48,393 --> 01:25:50,236
- He's fixing to get hurt out there.
- I hear you, man.

1533
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:51,756
You'll freaking get hurt, brother.

1534
01:25:51,813 --> 01:25:53,156
You ain't gonna
kill nobody, brother.

1535
01:25:53,231 --> 01:25:55,575
Unless you die your damn self
then you better chill out.

1536
01:25:55,651 --> 01:25:56,823
All right, now, all right!

1537
01:25:56,902 --> 01:25:58,745
You looking at a death
angel right now.

1538
01:25:59,154 --> 01:26:00,246
You got me, all right?

1539
01:26:00,322 --> 01:26:03,166
- That boy ain't no 600 dollars.
- I forfeit.

1540
01:26:03,241 --> 01:26:04,709
I forfeit.

1541
01:26:04,785 --> 01:26:06,162
You understand me?

1542
01:26:06,244 --> 01:26:08,997
I give up. I surrender.

1543
01:26:09,081 --> 01:26:12,711
Fine. Fine.
You wanna guard that kid?

1544
01:26:12,793 --> 01:26:14,295
You guard him.

1545
01:26:14,378 --> 01:26:15,755
He's got a guardian.

1546
01:26:16,046 --> 01:26:17,218
Go ahead and take off.
We'll keep him inside.

1547
01:26:17,297 --> 01:26:18,549
Thank you so much.

1548
01:26:18,632 --> 01:26:21,135
Bye, baby! Have fun, okay?

1549
01:26:21,385 --> 01:26:24,184
- You okay?
- Yeah. You?

1550
01:26:25,555 --> 01:26:26,556
I'm okay.

1551
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:31,027
Oh!

1552
01:26:31,103 --> 01:26:32,229
Oh, no.

1553
01:26:32,312 --> 01:26:34,314
Oh, shit!

1554
01:26:34,898 --> 01:26:36,741
Sorry about the bikes!

1555
01:26:43,573 --> 01:26:45,917
Did you really think
I was going to leave you?

1556
01:26:45,992 --> 01:26:46,993
Kind Of.

1557
01:26:47,077 --> 01:26:48,579
No way!

1558
01:26:49,538 --> 01:26:52,758
Well, what do you want to do now?

1559
01:26:52,833 --> 01:26:54,460
I got an idea.

1560
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:01,049
Hey, GUYS-

1561
01:27:01,133 --> 01:27:02,134
- Good evening.
- Hi.

1562
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:03,810
- How are you?
- Good.

1563
01:27:06,888 --> 01:27:08,185
- All right...
- Wait.

1564
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:13,862
Now, when we walk in that room,
your name is Lindsey Dill. Okay?

1565
01:27:13,937 --> 01:27:17,942
You're a pretty little girl, so no
farting and no swearing, you got it?

1566
01:27:18,442 --> 01:27:20,695
Let's go win us some money.

1567
01:27:20,777 --> 01:27:22,199
All right. Come on.

1568
01:27:26,783 --> 01:27:29,127
Hi. Is it okay if I
interview you guys?

1569
01:27:29,202 --> 01:27:30,704
Doing a behind-the-scenes
video for the pageant.

1570
01:27:30,787 --> 01:27:31,788
Sure.

1571
01:27:32,789 --> 01:27:34,462
Who are you?

1572
01:27:34,791 --> 01:27:35,792
Hi. My name's Jill.

1573
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:37,214
Can I ask you some questions
for our camera?

1574
01:27:37,294 --> 01:27:38,261
Yes.

1575
01:27:38,336 --> 01:27:39,462
Say, "Yes, ma'am" but don't baby-talk.

1576
01:27:39,546 --> 01:27:41,389
So, how many pageants
have you been in?

1577
01:27:41,465 --> 01:27:44,139
I've probably been in
a thousand pageants.

1578
01:27:44,217 --> 01:27:46,311
And how many of them did you win?

1579
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:49,144
I won every single one!

1580
01:27:49,639 --> 01:27:51,482
- What?
- Every single one!

1581
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:54,152
- I'm supposed to talk.
- It's competitive, it's a sport.

1582
01:27:54,227 --> 01:27:56,571
- And my friends...
- And so moms get...

1583
01:27:56,646 --> 01:27:57,818
You know, they get
into this competition

1584
01:27:57,898 --> 01:27:59,150
and if you're going to do it
and do it right...

1585
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:00,324
What are you doing?

1586
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,823
Stop, now. if you're going
to do it and do it right...

1587
01:28:02,903 --> 01:28:05,497
I mean, you've got to be
willing to be competitive.

1588
01:28:05,572 --> 01:28:06,664
And that's what happens, you know?

1589
01:28:06,740 --> 01:28:08,742
Sometimes I think competition,
just like any other sport,

1590
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:10,668
gets the best of everybody.

1591
01:28:10,786 --> 01:28:12,333
Well, thank you so much
for being here tonight

1592
01:28:12,454 --> 01:28:15,173
at the Carolina Cutie Pies
Young Miss Pageant.

1593
01:28:15,248 --> 01:28:17,671
And because
this is such a special night,

1594
01:28:17,751 --> 01:28:19,503
we have a very special
surprise for you.

1595
01:28:19,753 --> 01:28:25,510
Tonight, for the winner,
we're going to give away $5,000!

1596
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:27,348
Whoo!

1597
01:28:28,845 --> 01:28:30,518
$5,000!

1598
01:28:31,848 --> 01:28:33,691
That's crazy!

1599
01:28:38,188 --> 01:28:43,445
But now, we want to get into
our beauty gown competition.

1600
01:28:43,527 --> 01:28:45,120
Are you excited?

1601
01:28:45,195 --> 01:28:46,868
I know. I love it!

1602
01:28:47,447 --> 01:28:48,949
This is so funny!

1603
01:28:49,032 --> 01:28:51,034
Contestant number one,
please come to the stage.

1604
01:28:54,037 --> 01:28:55,880
Looking very beautiful tonight.

1605
01:29:13,223 --> 01:29:17,069
This is contestant number 10,
Lindsey Dill!

1606
01:29:17,561 --> 01:29:22,362
Lindsey has blazing blonde hair
and hazel eyes.

1607
01:29:22,649 --> 01:29:28,076
Her hobbies are football, fishing
and playing with her sock monkey!

1608
01:29:28,405 --> 01:29:30,578
That must be your proud grandpa.

1609
01:29:37,956 --> 01:29:42,177
Ladies and gentlemen,
contestant number 10, Lindsey Dill.

1610
01:29:46,673 --> 01:29:48,596
That's my granddaughter.

1611
01:29:57,642 --> 01:29:58,768
Hi-ya!

1612
01:30:08,361 --> 01:30:10,329
Let's give her a hand!

1613
01:30:11,865 --> 01:30:15,620
Your daughter's so precious.
She's so precious... She did really good.

1614
01:30:16,494 --> 01:30:20,249
I don't know if it'll be good enough
for first place, but she did really good.

1615
01:30:20,332 --> 01:30:23,051
Good Time
by Owl City and Carly Rae Jepsen.

1616
01:30:24,502 --> 01:30:26,425
So, how do you think
the competition's going so far?

1617
01:30:26,504 --> 01:30:27,505
Good.

1618
01:30:27,589 --> 01:30:29,762
Do you think you have
any stiff competition?

1619
01:30:30,133 --> 01:30:31,180
Some...

1620
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:34,559
one of these girls has
her grandpa here.

1621
01:30:35,263 --> 01:30:36,480
Is that weird?

1622
01:30:36,556 --> 01:30:38,604
We've just never seen it,
so it's different.

1623
01:30:38,934 --> 01:30:41,437
And this is contestant number 10.

1624
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:43,943
Everyone, Lindsey Dill!

1625
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:55,125
My Bonnie lies over the ocean

1626
01:30:55,617 --> 01:30:59,622
My Bonnie lies over the sea

1627
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:00,918
Aw...

1628
01:31:00,997 --> 01:31:04,376
My Bonnie lies over the ocean

1629
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:08,134
Please bring back my Bonnie to me

1630
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:35,577
We're locking it up.

1631
01:32:18,033 --> 01:32:19,034
Come on.

1632
01:32:20,243 --> 01:32:21,961
That's a boy?

1633
01:32:22,203 --> 01:32:24,205
Shit. Come on!

1634
01:32:24,914 --> 01:32:28,043
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's hear it for Lindsey Dill.

1635
01:32:42,057 --> 01:32:44,059
Grandpa, what'd you
think of my dancing?

1636
01:32:44,392 --> 01:32:46,736
Ha!
I loved your dancing.

1637
01:32:47,145 --> 01:32:51,491
You were Ginger Rogers
and Fred Astaire all rolled into one.

1638
01:32:51,816 --> 01:32:52,988
Gimme five.

1639
01:32:55,737 --> 01:32:58,661
Grandpa,
school starts on Tuesday.

1640
01:32:58,740 --> 01:33:00,208
Tuesday?

1641
01:33:00,283 --> 01:33:02,911
Hell, that's when
the ponies start running.

1642
01:33:03,411 --> 01:33:06,415
What do you say
I get you to school on Friday?

1643
01:33:06,623 --> 01:33:07,749
All right!

1644
01:33:21,930 --> 01:33:22,931
All right.

1645
01:33:27,769 --> 01:33:29,646
Does this look like a good spot?

1646
01:33:29,854 --> 01:33:32,027
This looks like as
good a spot as any.

1647
01:33:38,196 --> 01:33:39,539
Here we go!

1648
01:33:42,617 --> 01:33:44,290
Oh, my goodness!

1649
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:46,622
Oh, thanks, buddy.

1650
01:33:47,163 --> 01:33:48,210
Oh!

1651
01:33:53,711 --> 01:33:57,306
- You sure we should do this?
- This is what she wanted.

1652
01:33:58,466 --> 01:34:01,140
You got any final words
for your grandma?

1653
01:34:01,469 --> 01:34:02,641
Yeah.

1654
01:34:03,471 --> 01:34:04,973
Bye, Grandma.

1655
01:34:05,807 --> 01:34:07,150
Bye, Ellie.

1656
01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:13,231
Whoo!

1657
01:34:18,987 --> 01:34:20,330
Let's start fishing.

1658
01:34:20,446 --> 01:34:21,823
Let's fish.

1659
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:23,742
I call black one!

1660
01:34:23,992 --> 01:34:26,666
You got the black one?
Okay, I got the red one.

1661
01:34:26,786 --> 01:34:27,787
Whoa.

1662
01:34:28,830 --> 01:34:32,004
- Grandpa, I got to pee-pee.
- You got to pee-pee?

1663
01:34:32,333 --> 01:34:35,837
Well, dangle that little thing
through the railing and let her rip.

1664
01:34:36,087 --> 01:34:39,261
But point it that way
out of respect for your grandmother.

1665
01:35:04,199 --> 01:35:06,702
Man, get the fuck away from me.

1666
01:35:06,784 --> 01:35:07,956
What did I do?

1667
01:35:08,036 --> 01:35:12,132
- Can I get a hug? Dad?
- That wouldn't be appropriate, big guy.

1668
01:35:15,210 --> 01:35:17,929
- He says you have a fat kitty cat.
- Okay.

1669
01:35:18,213 --> 01:35:19,214
Hmm?

1670
01:35:19,297 --> 01:35:20,858
Jiggle my shoulders!
- I tried to do it!

1671
01:35:20,882 --> 01:35:23,556
Jiggle my... Ow! Jiggle! Jiggle!

1672
01:35:23,801 --> 01:35:24,973
What does he look like?

1673
01:35:25,053 --> 01:35:29,354
He's got a moustache,
big head, tall,

1674
01:35:29,432 --> 01:35:31,230
and, um, he smells like old farts.

1675
01:35:32,977 --> 01:35:34,497
Listen, old man.
I ain't fucking young.

1676
01:35:34,562 --> 01:35:37,907
I'm 45 years old. I'll fucking
tune you up. All right?

1677
01:35:37,982 --> 01:35:39,950
Mmm-hmm. Yep.

1678
01:35:40,068 --> 01:35:42,491
Hey. hey, hey, hey!
Listen up, listen up!

1679
01:35:42,570 --> 01:35:44,743
The gentleman you just saw in here
was Mr. Johnny Knoxville

1680
01:35:44,822 --> 01:35:47,291
and we are shooting a movie.

1681
01:35:52,622 --> 01:35:55,751
Thank you, everyone,
for putting up with me tonight,

1682
01:35:55,833 --> 01:35:57,506
and thank you for not
beating me up.

1683
01:35:57,585 --> 01:35:59,007
- High five!
- High five!

1684
01:35:59,087 --> 01:36:01,089
Why were you wearing a bra?

1685
01:36:01,172 --> 01:36:02,515
"Why were you
wearing a bra?"

1686
01:36:02,590 --> 01:36:04,183
For my dance.

1687
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:07,433
Well, that was inappropriate!

1688
01:36:07,512 --> 01:36:09,606
Doris, what did you think?

1689
01:36:09,764 --> 01:36:12,108
My mother's not gonna like this!

1690
01:36:13,434 --> 01:36:16,358
- We're shooting a movie.
- No way!

1691
01:36:16,437 --> 01:36:19,316
- You've got to be kidding me!
- Oh, my God!

1692
01:36:19,399 --> 01:36:22,403
I just did all of that and...
Oh, my God!

1693
01:36:22,610 --> 01:36:25,284
And a rusty trombone for my grandpa.

1694
01:36:25,530 --> 01:36:28,454
- A rusty trombone for your grandpa, huh?
- Yep.

1695
01:36:28,533 --> 01:36:32,538
Well, I need to take your picture to see
if you're on a milk carton somewhere.

1696
01:36:32,620 --> 01:36:34,122
What do you think?

1697
01:36:34,706 --> 01:36:35,878
Don't hurt me!

1698
01:36:35,957 --> 01:36:37,959
Hurt you?
I'm 86 years old.

1699
01:36:38,042 --> 01:36:39,043
Don't hurt me!

1700
01:36:41,129 --> 01:36:43,006
Oh...

1701
01:36:44,465 --> 01:36:46,308
Billy! Billy!

1702
01:36:51,014 --> 01:36:52,311
Ow!

1703
01:36:56,811 --> 01:36:58,313
What is a whore?

1704
01:36:58,646 --> 01:37:00,694
Oh, boy. Uh...

1705
01:37:01,983 --> 01:37:04,156
Oh, boy, that's a tough one.

1706
01:37:05,486 --> 01:37:07,830
All right, here we go.

1707
01:37:17,665 --> 01:37:20,794
Poof! I'm an old prick now.

1708
01:37:21,002 --> 01:37:23,846
Oh, yeah?
Get a load of this!

1709
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:34,100
My mommy loves crack
almost as much as I love fishing.

1710
01:37:34,182 --> 01:37:36,355
I'm sorry, what did you just say?

1711
01:37:44,442 --> 01:37:45,489
Can I help you?

1712
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:48,033
Talk more like an old man.

1713
01:37:48,363 --> 01:37:49,865
- Me?
- Yes.

1714
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:54,123
Yeah, he sounds like Johnny Knoxville.

1715
01:37:57,538 --> 01:38:01,418
I hate this job.
I fucking hate you!

1716
01:38:02,710 --> 01:38:06,556
This is a camera, in there.

1717
01:38:06,798 --> 01:38:08,266
That's a camera.

1718
01:38:08,383 --> 01:38:10,556
I think there's a camera
here somewhere.

1719
01:38:15,932 --> 01:38:18,936
- Talk to that.
- Okay, and when... Hi, how are you?

1720
01:38:19,018 --> 01:38:21,521
Oh, look at me! I look beautiful!

1721
01:38:23,898 --> 01:38:25,571
That's one ugly bitch.

1722
01:38:26,818 --> 01:38:28,536
It's interesting. Every time
I work with these guys,

1723
01:38:28,611 --> 01:38:30,739
I'm either in a casket
or around a casket.

1724
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,673
I like standing here.

1725
01:38:46,254 --> 01:38:47,927
And I like standing here.

1726
01:38:48,256 --> 01:38:50,930
But my favorite spot is here.

1727
01:38:51,259 --> 01:38:52,431
- Come on.
- Get away.

1728
01:38:52,677 --> 01:38:57,228
I may be too old to stir the gumbo, but I
can still lick the ladle, that's for sure.

1729
01:38:57,306 --> 01:38:58,853
Oh, my God.

1730
01:38:58,933 --> 01:39:02,688
In my opinion, ladle-licking is more
important than gumbo-stirring anyway.

1731
01:39:02,770 --> 01:39:04,943
Oh, I can lick my eyebrows.

1732
01:39:05,189 --> 01:39:06,190
Get out!

1733
01:39:07,817 --> 01:39:08,818
Fuck.

1734
01:39:13,030 --> 01:39:15,704
Oh, my God!

1735
01:39:31,299 --> 01:39:32,642
Are you all right?

1736
01:39:38,473 --> 01:39:40,692
- Okay.
- Oh, man.

1737
01:39:46,481 --> 01:39:47,482
Whoa.

1738
01:39:53,154 --> 01:39:54,497
Big finish.

1739
01:40:01,996 --> 01:40:03,498
What's going on here?

1740
01:40:03,581 --> 01:40:04,924
Get out of here, asshole.

1741
01:40:05,166 --> 01:40:08,010
We have to bring in
your stunt double.

1742
01:40:14,675 --> 01:40:16,518
- Thank you.
- You gotta be shittin' me, man!

1743
01:40:16,594 --> 01:40:18,954
I'm sitting there looking,
I'm like, "What is up with this?"

1744
01:40:19,013 --> 01:40:20,185
Are you serious?

1745
01:40:20,264 --> 01:40:22,187
You guys are so sweet
to look after Billy.

1746
01:40:22,266 --> 01:40:23,563
- Oh, my God!
- How are you?

1747
01:40:25,978 --> 01:40:26,979
Ugh!

1748
01:40:31,859 --> 01:40:33,111
Oh, I'm sorry, Kelman.

1749
01:40:41,369 --> 01:40:45,044
My Bonnie lies over the ocean

1750
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:50,796
My Bonnie lies over the sea

1751
01:40:50,878 --> 01:40:54,758
My Bonnie lies over the ocean

1752
01:40:55,550 --> 01:41:00,101
So bring back my Bonnie to me
