1
00:01:23,044 --> 00:01:26,454
♪ Ring-around-the-rosy ♪

2
00:01:26,654 --> 00:01:28,588
Now, I'm trying to tell you...

3
00:01:28,656 --> 00:01:30,851
that we can't afford to
keep you here anymore.

4
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:33,503
You already owe two months
worth of back rent.

5
00:01:33,646 --> 00:01:35,848
It's mine, and you're
not taking it away.

6
00:01:35,868 --> 00:01:39,868
Read the will, Nell. It
states, in plain language:

7
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,846
"The executor shall have
the right to dispose of...

8
00:01:42,866 --> 00:01:46,047
any and all personal property
as he shall see fit."

9
00:01:46,067 --> 00:01:48,979
- He's not even real family.
- Yeah, well, maybe not.

10
00:01:48,999 --> 00:01:52,195
But clearly, Mother thought Lou
would be much better equipped...

11
00:01:52,215 --> 00:01:54,281
to deal with these
unpleasant details than you.

12
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:56,410
"Unpleasant details"?

13
00:01:57,706 --> 00:02:00,363
What have I been dealing
with for the past 11 years?

14
00:02:00,544 --> 00:02:04,268
I've cooked, cleaned,
mopped up her urine!
You call that an "unpleasant detail"?

15
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,858
- Hey, your sister didn't write the will.
- We all know what you've done.

16
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:09,414
- We're trying to help.
- Do not help me!

17
00:02:13,035 --> 00:02:16,865
Oh, Ritchie. Just go sit
on the couch, okay?

18
00:02:17,157 --> 00:02:17,917
Oh.

19
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,193
Anyway, once probate closes,

20
00:02:21,213 --> 00:02:23,044
we can put this apartment
on the market,

21
00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:25,619
and we all might be able
to make a few bucks.

22
00:02:26,751 --> 00:02:30,714
Also, we know how much you love Mom's
car, so we're giving it to you.

23
00:02:31,195 --> 00:02:35,451
You're taking away my home and
giving me a 20-year-old car?

24
00:02:35,787 --> 00:02:40,069
Absolutely. We'll deduct the value
from the proceeds of the apartment.

25
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,609
Who are you?

26
00:02:42,097 --> 00:02:45,590
Do you understand that
I have nowhere to go?

27
00:02:48,744 --> 00:02:52,750
We've been talking, and... Lou
and I are very busy, and...

28
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:56,517
we could use someone to help us
with the cleaning and the cooking,

29
00:02:57,493 --> 00:02:58,958
Looking after Ritchie?

30
00:03:03,504 --> 00:03:07,448
Eleanor, help me. I gotta pee.

31
00:03:09,858 --> 00:03:11,548
Ritchie, not now!

32
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,157
Get outta my home.

33
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,196
Well, suit yourself. We'll
let the courts handle it.

34
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:22,783
Get out of my home.

35
00:03:24,048 --> 00:03:26,724
Honey, let go. That's right.
Oops. Sorry. Okay.

36
00:03:29,582 --> 00:03:31,619
Here you go, honey.
Follow Daddy.

37
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:37,551
Come live with us, Nell.

38
00:03:37,832 --> 00:03:40,161
You have no idea how
hard it is out there.

39
00:03:40,339 --> 00:03:43,823
No, Jane. You have no idea
how hard it was in here.

40
00:04:52,844 --> 00:04:53,867
Hello.

41
00:04:57,135 --> 00:04:58,778
Yes, this is Eleanor.

42
00:05:01,596 --> 00:05:02,701
Where?

43
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:12,971
I see it.

44
00:05:16,719 --> 00:05:19,658
"Research subjects.
Nine hundred a week."

45
00:05:20,408 --> 00:05:21,901
Here's how they're organized.

46
00:05:22,484 --> 00:05:24,696
The groups have very
different personalities.

47
00:05:25,072 --> 00:05:28,396
Scored all over the Kiersey Temperament
Sorter, just like you asked for,

48
00:05:28,946 --> 00:05:31,139
and they all score very high
on the insomnia charts.

49
00:05:31,307 --> 00:05:33,334
Oh, what a beautiful profile.

50
00:05:33,836 --> 00:05:36,267
A classic dependent
personality disorder.

51
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:39,637
However, we were looking
for "suggestible."

52
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,120
Her mother died two months ago.

53
00:05:42,507 --> 00:05:44,254
She really wants to do this.

54
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:47,340
And what are your
feelings, Mary?

55
00:05:47,457 --> 00:05:49,682
Tell me what your
intuitions say.

56
00:05:50,822 --> 00:05:52,428
I put my favorites on top.

57
00:05:52,688 --> 00:05:55,289
Mm-hmm. What else
have we got here?

58
00:05:55,868 --> 00:05:58,699
"Low self-esteem,
high narcissism,

59
00:06:00,369 --> 00:06:02,256
chronic feeling of emptiness,

60
00:06:02,415 --> 00:06:03,841
identity disturbance."

61
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:05,582
Good, good. Very good.

62
00:06:07,096 --> 00:06:08,611
Is this where we're going?

63
00:06:09,218 --> 00:06:11,358
That's Hill House. It's
perfect, isn't it?

64
00:06:11,884 --> 00:06:14,861
- The Hill House Project...
- Is absolutely essential
to my research, Malcom.

65
00:06:14,881 --> 00:06:17,201
No, just listen. I grant you,

66
00:06:17,221 --> 00:06:21,755
fear and performance
is a big, sexy idea.

67
00:06:22,254 --> 00:06:26,105
- But as chairman of this
department, I cannot...
- I know you clinical guys...

68
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,144
don't like to ask these
questions, but think about it.

69
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:32,284
What is fear, anyway?
It's a series of automatic
responses to a given stimulus,

70
00:06:32,304 --> 00:06:36,173
characterized by increased
heart rate, respiratory activity
and adrenaline function.

71
00:06:36,282 --> 00:06:40,743
The only problem with fear is
that it has largely become
inappropriate and nonadaptive.

72
00:06:40,903 --> 00:06:43,318
Do sweaty palms help
to talk to your boss?

73
00:06:43,338 --> 00:06:47,638
Does a racing pulse help
some kid's score on an SAT?

74
00:06:47,854 --> 00:06:50,316
And yet we carry with us these
primordial fear responses...

75
00:06:50,336 --> 00:06:52,498
that do the opposite of what
they were intended to do.

76
00:06:52,518 --> 00:06:54,595
- So why is that?
- David, David, no one is saying...

77
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:56,162
that these aren't
provocative questions.

78
00:06:56,182 --> 00:07:00,084
But you can't conduct this
research ethically or responsibly.

79
00:07:00,104 --> 00:07:02,788
And on top of that, you're
bringing your insomniacs...

80
00:07:02,808 --> 00:07:04,714
to this house under
false pretenses.

81
00:07:04,734 --> 00:07:08,207
Because the experiment needs
a credible cover story.
Calling it an insomnia study...

82
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:10,424
allows me to create a highly
suggestive environment...

83
00:07:10,603 --> 00:07:12,556
to investigate the
dynamics of fear.

84
00:07:12,697 --> 00:07:17,194
You don't tell the rats they're
actually in a maze, Malcom. Come on.

85
00:08:58,164 --> 00:08:59,408
What do you want?

86
00:09:01,147 --> 00:09:03,202
Are... Are you Mr. Dudley,
the caretaker?

87
00:09:03,462 --> 00:09:07,540
Yeah. I'm Mr. Dudley, the caretaker.
But what are you doing here?

88
00:09:07,968 --> 00:09:09,574
I'm with Dr. Marrow's group.

89
00:09:09,696 --> 00:09:12,090
I'm supposed to see Mrs. Dudley.
Is she here?

90
00:09:13,226 --> 00:09:14,484
Where do you think?

91
00:09:19,946 --> 00:09:21,918
Why do you need so many chains?

92
00:09:24,711 --> 00:09:26,270
That's a good question.

93
00:09:26,836 --> 00:09:28,830
What is it about fences?

94
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:32,954
Sometimes the people on either side
of the fence see a locked chain,

95
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:36,869
they feel a little more comfortable.
Why do you suppose that is?

96
00:10:29,641 --> 00:10:31,068
Mrs. Dudley?

97
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:34,674
Hello?

98
00:10:46,641 --> 00:10:48,022
Mrs. Dudley?

99
00:11:18,281 --> 00:11:19,455
Hello?

100
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,731
Hello? Mrs. Dudley?

101
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,100
Oh, my...

102
00:12:12,735 --> 00:12:15,112
I'm... I'm, uh...
I'm Eleanor Vance.

103
00:12:15,132 --> 00:12:17,313
- I'm here with the...
- Dr. Marrow's group.

104
00:12:17,485 --> 00:12:18,865
You're the first.

105
00:12:19,645 --> 00:12:21,870
Yeah, I'd... I'd heard
a sound, and that's...

106
00:12:22,422 --> 00:12:26,103
It's make the dinner
or answer the door.
Can't do both.

107
00:12:26,301 --> 00:12:29,465
- Are you Mrs. Dudley?
- So far.

108
00:12:30,861 --> 00:12:32,429
I'll show you your room.

109
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:36,795
This way.

110
00:13:41,383 --> 00:13:43,024
The Red Room.

111
00:13:43,466 --> 00:13:46,611
You're going to be the first
visitors Hill House has had...

112
00:13:46,871 --> 00:13:49,786
- since Mr. Crain died.
- Really?

113
00:14:21,229 --> 00:14:22,769
These are beautiful.

114
00:14:23,313 --> 00:14:25,733
I know. I've seen 'em.
It's a lot to dust.

115
00:14:28,058 --> 00:14:30,171
I've never seen this
kind of beauty.

116
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:33,123
You must love working here.

117
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:36,484
I set dinner on the dining
room sideboard at six.

118
00:14:36,844 --> 00:14:40,553
You can serve yourselves.
Breakfast is ready at nine.

119
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,804
I don't wait on people.

120
00:14:44,111 --> 00:14:46,087
I don't stay after dinner,

121
00:14:46,347 --> 00:14:48,479
not after it begins to get dark.

122
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,900
I leave... before dark comes.

123
00:14:52,633 --> 00:14:55,568
We live in town... nine miles...

124
00:14:55,588 --> 00:14:57,974
so there won't be anyone
around if you need help.

125
00:14:58,574 --> 00:15:00,992
We couldn't even hear you...
in the night.

126
00:15:01,989 --> 00:15:03,187
Why would we?

127
00:15:03,557 --> 00:15:04,684
No one could.

128
00:15:05,313 --> 00:15:07,491
No one lives any
nearer than town.

129
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,430
No one will come any
nearer than that...

130
00:15:11,088 --> 00:15:12,242
in the night,

131
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,812
in the dark.

132
00:15:58,294 --> 00:16:00,727
You'll be staying
in the north wing.

133
00:16:01,249 --> 00:16:04,977
Hi. Don't worry. I'm not
an obsessive packer.

134
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:07,850
It's just asking people to help me
schlepp this stuff is a cheap...

135
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:10,401
and exploitative way
of making new friends.

136
00:16:10,745 --> 00:16:13,026
- Here. I'm Theo.
- Hi.

137
00:16:13,046 --> 00:16:15,218
Eleanor, but everyone
calls me Nell.

138
00:16:15,478 --> 00:16:19,203
Well, 'Everyone Calls Me
Nell', don't you love it here?

139
00:16:19,552 --> 00:16:24,508
I love it.
Sort of Charles Foster Kane meets
the Munsters or something.

140
00:16:24,528 --> 00:16:27,174
- I like your boots.
- You do? Aren't they great?

141
00:16:28,004 --> 00:16:32,443
Prada. Milan, not New York.
But they're killing me.

142
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:37,697
Hey, small price to pay
for such savage kicks.

143
00:16:47,463 --> 00:16:49,726
Wow. Oh, my God.

144
00:16:53,337 --> 00:16:55,516
Oh, this is so twisted.

145
00:16:57,668 --> 00:16:59,189
Seriously twisted.

146
00:16:59,362 --> 00:17:02,610
I set dinner on the dining
room sideboard at six.

147
00:17:02,869 --> 00:17:04,616
Breakfast is at nine.

148
00:17:04,788 --> 00:17:08,657
I don't stay after dinner, not
after it begins to get dark.

149
00:17:09,245 --> 00:17:11,432
I leave before dark comes,

150
00:17:12,277 --> 00:17:14,615
so there won't be anyone
here if you need help.

151
00:17:14,896 --> 00:17:16,549
We couldn't even hear you.

152
00:17:17,431 --> 00:17:18,493
No one could.

153
00:17:18,764 --> 00:17:20,488
No one lives any
nearer than town.

154
00:17:20,508 --> 00:17:22,677
No one will come any
nearer than that.

155
00:17:23,985 --> 00:17:25,147
In the night.

156
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,417
In the dark

157
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,262
In the dark.

158
00:17:39,575 --> 00:17:41,832
My bedroom's right
next door to yours.

159
00:17:44,518 --> 00:17:46,377
I think we share
the same bathroom.

160
00:17:46,534 --> 00:17:48,966
Oh, don't worry. I probably
won't be in here much.

161
00:17:49,154 --> 00:17:51,642
- Light sleeper.
- That's why we're here.

162
00:17:54,012 --> 00:17:56,810
- What do you do, Eleanor?
- I'm between jobs right now.

163
00:17:57,084 --> 00:18:00,740
The last person I was workin' for,
it ended. Over, so... And you?

164
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:03,284
Well, that depends.

165
00:18:03,655 --> 00:18:05,662
I'm supposed to be an artist,

166
00:18:06,496 --> 00:18:08,758
but I've been distracted
from work by love.

167
00:18:08,778 --> 00:18:11,009
- You know what I mean?
- Mmm, not really.

168
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:14,005
Hey, don't tell me Boston's
different from New York.

169
00:18:14,238 --> 00:18:16,529
Oh, you mean you have
trouble with commitment.

170
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:21,135
Well, my boyfriend thinks
so, my girlfriend doesn't.

171
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:26,307
If we could all live together...
But they hate each other.

172
00:18:27,053 --> 00:18:28,893
Hello? The bag.

173
00:18:29,867 --> 00:18:33,941
You know, it's hard when you're
the only one at the party.

174
00:18:33,961 --> 00:18:36,276
- You know what I mean?
- No.

175
00:18:37,579 --> 00:18:38,894
A blank canvas.

176
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,357
I could paint your
portrait directly on you.

177
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:46,088
Or maybe not.

178
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:49,873
So, what about you?

179
00:18:51,483 --> 00:18:54,106
Husbands? Boyfriends?

180
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,876
Girlfriends, Eleanor?

181
00:18:59,601 --> 00:19:00,887
Where do you live?

182
00:19:01,742 --> 00:19:03,573
Mmm. I don't have anyone.

183
00:19:05,706 --> 00:19:07,988
But I do have a little
apartment of my own.

184
00:19:08,345 --> 00:19:10,143
It has a little flower garden.

185
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,971
You can just see the ocean.
And when the wind...

186
00:19:12,991 --> 00:19:15,787
comes in just right, you can
hear the buoys in the harbor.

187
00:19:17,843 --> 00:19:21,251
Wow. That sounds really nice.

188
00:19:22,967 --> 00:19:26,281
You're lucky. But you
know that, right?

189
00:19:28,532 --> 00:19:29,743
Oh, sorry.

190
00:19:29,952 --> 00:19:31,605
Just a little hair.

191
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,801
So, show me the bathroom!

192
00:19:34,969 --> 00:19:37,266
Oh, it's really beautiful.

193
00:19:38,271 --> 00:19:40,346
It is huge.

194
00:19:41,167 --> 00:19:44,434
- Oh, my God!
- This is the bathroom.

195
00:19:44,656 --> 00:19:47,591
- Look at this bathtub.
Can you believe it?

196
00:19:47,663 --> 00:19:49,597
Look at that. Wow!

197
00:19:49,665 --> 00:19:51,792
Look at my bedroom, though.

198
00:19:53,063 --> 00:19:55,304
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Yes.

199
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,554
- Let's go see the Great Hall.
- Uh-huh.

200
00:19:58,574 --> 00:20:01,008
I mean, there's so much carving.
It's everywhere.

201
00:20:01,077 --> 00:20:03,011
- I know.
- Oh, look at this one.

202
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:06,359
- Isn't this one great?
- No, that's creepy.

203
00:20:06,379 --> 00:20:08,952
Oh, and this one.
This one's weird.

204
00:20:14,499 --> 00:20:18,525
Well, you don't get this from
the Martha Stewart catalog.

205
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,756
I don't like it.

206
00:20:22,913 --> 00:20:26,126
Isn't it based on 'The
Gates of Hell' by Rodin?

207
00:20:26,493 --> 00:20:28,163
Well, it's not just hell.

208
00:20:28,653 --> 00:20:31,292
See, the children, they're
reaching for heaven,

209
00:20:31,312 --> 00:20:33,743
but their souls are
trapped in purgatory.

210
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,483
And these are the demons...

211
00:20:44,266 --> 00:20:47,198
who can hold on to your soul
for as long as they want.

212
00:20:48,301 --> 00:20:49,905
Did you study art?

213
00:20:49,925 --> 00:20:54,367
No, I studied purgatory. I
was there once for 11 years.

214
00:20:57,131 --> 00:21:00,051
It's when your soul is caught
between the living and the dead.

215
00:21:00,147 --> 00:21:02,298
Oh, yeah, I've been there.

216
00:21:02,952 --> 00:21:06,370
It's an 18-hour flight from L.A. to
Paris, and you're stuck in coach.

217
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,329
Do you see?

218
00:21:10,183 --> 00:21:13,225
All ye who stand before these
doors shall be judged.

219
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:16,737
Well, let's not stand here.
Come on.

220
00:21:16,757 --> 00:21:17,677
Okay.

221
00:21:28,029 --> 00:21:29,381
Whoa.

222
00:21:36,098 --> 00:21:38,229
- Is it real?
- No.

223
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:45,710
- Shall we go in?
- Yes.

224
00:21:57,392 --> 00:21:58,716
Wow!

225
00:22:07,742 --> 00:22:08,600
Whoo!

226
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:13,304
- Wow!
- Wow!

227
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:18,256
It's beautiful!

228
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:23,477
Oh, lala de da lala

229
00:22:24,507 --> 00:22:26,892
- Would you care to dance?
- Yes.

230
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:32,242
I'm starting to like this house!

231
00:22:32,262 --> 00:22:34,084
This is great!

232
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:40,205
Let's get outta here.

233
00:22:46,749 --> 00:22:50,987
God! We're like rats...
rats in a maze.

234
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:53,829
Oh, God! If I ruin
these boots...

235
00:22:53,967 --> 00:22:55,883
Jesus, they cost me a fortune.

236
00:22:56,003 --> 00:22:58,622
- Let's go back.
- It's gotta be through here.

237
00:22:59,888 --> 00:23:02,393
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

238
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:06,752
Oh. Hey, I'm sorry. I
didn't mean to scare you.

239
00:23:07,488 --> 00:23:10,324
I'm Luke Sanderson,
just a bad sleeper.

240
00:23:10,936 --> 00:23:13,668
Basic tosser-turner.
And you are?

241
00:23:13,813 --> 00:23:16,534
- Nell Vance.
- What kind of sleeper? Nightmares?

242
00:23:16,554 --> 00:23:17,482
Not really.

243
00:23:17,502 --> 00:23:19,683
- Anxiety attacks?
- No. Uh-uh.

244
00:23:21,007 --> 00:23:22,918
Okay. Obsessive indecision.

245
00:23:22,938 --> 00:23:26,149
Wow. And you? Let me think.

246
00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:29,142
You, I'm gonna guess, are a...

247
00:23:29,162 --> 00:23:30,920
Don't even start.

248
00:23:33,233 --> 00:23:34,923
Wow, you're so dominant.

249
00:23:36,235 --> 00:23:38,870
Thanks. Theo.

250
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:41,043
Hey, Theo.

251
00:23:51,654 --> 00:23:52,903
Jesus.

252
00:23:53,842 --> 00:23:55,025
Here we are.

253
00:23:59,692 --> 00:24:01,206
- Hey.
- You're Luke.

254
00:24:01,226 --> 00:24:03,663
- Yup.
- You're Theo. You're Eleanor.

255
00:24:03,683 --> 00:24:05,330
Hi, I'm Dr. Marrow.

256
00:24:05,398 --> 00:24:07,332
- Welcome.
- Hello, Dr. Marrow.

257
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,237
- This is Todd. He's just come up.
- Greetings, fellow insomniac.

258
00:24:10,257 --> 00:24:13,638
Mary Lambetta, my assistant.
So how was your drive, Eleanor?

259
00:24:13,789 --> 00:24:16,060
- It was fine. Yeah.
- Good. Good.

260
00:24:19,949 --> 00:24:22,756
Welcome to Hill House, everyone.
Come on.

261
00:24:23,592 --> 00:24:25,836
All right. Let the
good times roll.

262
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:44,306
Do you know what? The rest of
you may hate your insomnia,

263
00:24:44,326 --> 00:24:46,974
but I'm not sure I
want a cure for mine.

264
00:24:47,176 --> 00:24:50,237
That's when I get all my best ideas,
when I'm waiting to fall asleep.

265
00:24:50,717 --> 00:24:55,290
I'm alone, occasionally,
with no distractions,

266
00:24:55,832 --> 00:24:58,386
my mind's racing
with creative ideas,

267
00:24:58,406 --> 00:25:01,635
and come 3:00 a.m., I
feel like a genius.

268
00:25:01,803 --> 00:25:04,122
Are you kidding me? 3:00 a.m.
I start to feel...

269
00:25:04,142 --> 00:25:07,584
like I'm losing my mind, watching
those infomercials on psychics...

270
00:25:07,604 --> 00:25:11,273
or listening to Tony Robbins
and the psychic hot lines.

271
00:25:11,393 --> 00:25:14,591
- Have you ever seen that late-night TV?
- Oh, yeah. Thank you.

272
00:25:14,851 --> 00:25:17,569
I swear to God. You get a
steady diet of that crap,

273
00:25:17,589 --> 00:25:20,077
and pretty soon you start thinking
about movin' to Montana...

274
00:25:20,097 --> 00:25:22,049
and becomin' a survivalist.

275
00:25:22,219 --> 00:25:24,434
That's why God created
barbiturates, honey.

276
00:25:24,855 --> 00:25:26,679
- Nembutal?
- Mm-mm.

277
00:25:26,883 --> 00:25:31,150
No, Todd, I think we have a classic
Seconal woman on our hands.

278
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:35,648
In fact, I think I see a
little Jackie Susann in Theo.

279
00:25:38,833 --> 00:25:40,841
- Ow.
- All right, you two.

280
00:25:40,861 --> 00:25:42,739
Enough about pharmaceuticals.

281
00:25:45,716 --> 00:25:48,907
So, look, what do we
all need in life?

282
00:25:48,927 --> 00:25:52,627
- What are the basics?
Food, water, shelter.
- Sex.

283
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:53,923
Rrreooww.

284
00:25:54,557 --> 00:25:56,840
And sleep. Sleep.

285
00:25:57,215 --> 00:26:00,510
I'm working on a five-year study,
with the help of Mary here,

286
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:02,896
making profiles
of bad sleepers.

287
00:26:03,091 --> 00:26:05,804
I'm looking for a common
psychological link.

288
00:26:06,594 --> 00:26:11,356
I hope that the work we do here
will someday be able to help
other people like yourselves.

289
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,218
God knows I'm all for helping
people, saving the world,

290
00:26:15,238 --> 00:26:18,562
but doesn't everybody have a
problem sleeping these days?

291
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:20,478
Life's too frantic.

292
00:26:21,717 --> 00:26:23,201
What about you, Nell?

293
00:26:24,948 --> 00:26:28,804
Um, well, it seems that you
all have trouble sleeping,

294
00:26:28,824 --> 00:26:33,153
because your lives are exciting,
and it's complicated, and you think
about it when you go to sleep.

295
00:26:33,173 --> 00:26:36,836
But, um, I don't know. Nothing's
ever really happened to me,

296
00:26:36,856 --> 00:26:38,976
so I don't have a
reason to sleep badly.

297
00:26:39,505 --> 00:26:42,331
But in your application you
said you had trouble sleeping.

298
00:26:42,869 --> 00:26:45,113
Mm-hmm, yes, but
it's not like them.

299
00:26:45,724 --> 00:26:49,059
It's because, uh, there was
always somebody calling me,

300
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:50,975
there was always
somebody banging.

301
00:26:52,543 --> 00:26:56,129
Ever since I was little, I
took care of my mother.

302
00:26:56,208 --> 00:27:00,281
And... and she would wake up
in the middle of the night.

303
00:27:01,265 --> 00:27:03,932
She would bang with
her cane on the wall.

304
00:27:04,906 --> 00:27:07,028
And it was just
this relentless...

305
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:11,094
it was a relentless banging
all through the night.

306
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:14,571
That's weird, because...

307
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:18,449
even though, uh, she's dead, I
still hear it and I wake up.

308
00:27:25,485 --> 00:27:28,349
Well, that's why we're here, Eleanor...
to try and help you.

309
00:27:29,507 --> 00:27:31,873
Yeah, Nell. I think what
Dr. Marrow's trying to say is...

310
00:27:31,893 --> 00:27:34,737
that you're a basket case,
just like the rest of us.

311
00:27:42,172 --> 00:27:43,656
Thank you, Mary.

312
00:27:49,423 --> 00:27:53,291
Okay. Okay. Why are we here?

313
00:27:53,658 --> 00:27:55,650
Really, to answer the
most basic question:

314
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:58,086
What is wrong with you people?

315
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:01,671
These are standard cognitive
and perception tests.

316
00:28:01,773 --> 00:28:04,730
I'll be giving you a variety of these
during the course of the week.

317
00:28:04,954 --> 00:28:09,537
You are not in competition,
so do not worry about being
the head of the class, okay?

318
00:28:10,786 --> 00:28:12,927
Between all these tests,
you'll have each other...

319
00:28:12,947 --> 00:28:15,068
Todd... and the house
to keep you company.

320
00:28:15,225 --> 00:28:17,375
Luke. Eleanor.

321
00:28:19,252 --> 00:28:21,815
- But we can't go to town.
- No.

322
00:28:22,328 --> 00:28:25,352
And as you were told, there's no
telephone service, there's no TV.

323
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,576
And the caretakers tend to lock the
gate when they leave. However,

324
00:28:30,363 --> 00:28:35,411
I do have my trusty cell telephone,
in case of emergencies, okay?

325
00:28:36,783 --> 00:28:40,145
What's the deal with the
Addams Family mansion?
Because, I gotta be honest,

326
00:28:40,165 --> 00:28:42,549
I don't get a real strong sleep
vibe from this place.

327
00:28:42,569 --> 00:28:43,841
No. Me too.

328
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,056
I wanted to make sure you
didn't sleep too easily.

329
00:28:46,076 --> 00:28:49,639
- Well, congratulations.
- Seriously, isolation is essential...

330
00:28:49,804 --> 00:28:51,993
in the creation of an
experimental model.

331
00:28:52,747 --> 00:28:55,292
This house, who built it?
Who lived here?

332
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:58,710
Well, actually, that makes for
a very good bedtime story.

333
00:29:01,304 --> 00:29:04,674
Once upon a time, there was
a king who built a castle.

334
00:29:05,649 --> 00:29:07,365
His name was Hugh Crain.

335
00:29:08,391 --> 00:29:09,798
A hundred and thirty years ago,

336
00:29:09,818 --> 00:29:13,130
towns like Concord and Manchester
were the center of American industry.

337
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,166
That's where Crain
made a fortune...

338
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:17,535
on the backs of workers
in his textile mills.

339
00:29:17,658 --> 00:29:20,161
Now, this man could have
anything he wanted,

340
00:29:20,181 --> 00:29:22,210
but what he wanted
more than anything...

341
00:29:22,737 --> 00:29:24,803
was a house filled with
the laughter of children.

342
00:29:25,423 --> 00:29:27,536
That's why there are
all the carvings.

343
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:31,399
He married the most beautiful
woman in town, called Rene,

344
00:29:31,419 --> 00:29:34,502
and he built her this house,
or at least some of it.

345
00:29:34,808 --> 00:29:37,437
God, it sounds like a
fairy tale or something.

346
00:29:37,541 --> 00:29:39,288
But that's where the
fairy tale ends.

347
00:29:39,308 --> 00:29:41,402
Hugh and Rene would
have no children.

348
00:29:42,785 --> 00:29:44,297
They all died at birth.

349
00:29:45,087 --> 00:29:47,941
Then, a few years later,
Rene, she passed away,

350
00:29:47,961 --> 00:29:49,904
and Crain became
a total recluse.

351
00:29:50,073 --> 00:29:54,240
But he kept on building,
adding room upon room.

352
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:57,847
It's as if he was...
he was building a home for the
family he would never have.

353
00:29:58,636 --> 00:30:00,739
No one had seen
Crain for years.

354
00:30:01,162 --> 00:30:04,132
But the townspeople said
that sometimes at night...

355
00:30:04,152 --> 00:30:06,668
they could hear sounds
coming from the old house.

356
00:30:08,584 --> 00:30:10,124
Sounds of children.

357
00:30:16,767 --> 00:30:17,828
So sad.

358
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:22,565
Ooh! Jesus Christ!

359
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:28,129
Christ, I need a drink.

360
00:30:30,571 --> 00:30:32,758
I think there's
more to that story.

361
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:37,359
I can feel it. I-it's
all around us.

362
00:30:38,672 --> 00:30:40,212
It's in the ceiling.

363
00:30:40,607 --> 00:30:42,203
It's in the walls.

364
00:30:43,095 --> 00:30:44,710
It's in the furniture.

365
00:30:47,046 --> 00:30:48,257
It's in this.

366
00:30:51,945 --> 00:30:54,584
- Mary!
- Oh, Jesus. Oh, no.

367
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:58,390
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- All right.

368
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:01,104
What happened? Let me see.
Oh, my God!

369
00:31:01,364 --> 00:31:03,048
- Keep your hand away from it.
- Don't touch it.

370
00:31:03,068 --> 00:31:06,818
- What are you doing?
- This'll stop the blood from
getting into her eye.

371
00:31:06,938 --> 00:31:09,075
Mary, we're going to get you
to the hospital straightaway.

372
00:31:09,095 --> 00:31:11,583
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be okay.

373
00:31:14,536 --> 00:31:15,982
Three steps.

374
00:31:18,339 --> 00:31:19,334
Please!

375
00:31:19,354 --> 00:31:21,156
It's all right. It's all right.

376
00:31:28,176 --> 00:31:30,790
- Careful. Be careful.
- Here's the gate key to get back in.

377
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:33,542
You have my cell number. Call me the
second you've spoken to a doctor.

378
00:31:33,562 --> 00:31:36,443
- All right, Dr. Marrow.
- Hey, I want you guys back
as soon as possible.

379
00:31:36,463 --> 00:31:38,500
- Okay, Mary?
- Okay.

380
00:31:39,514 --> 00:31:40,829
You'll be all right.

381
00:31:48,436 --> 00:31:50,239
She almost lost her eye.

382
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,279
Almost.

383
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:55,844
Luke, there's something
about the house,

384
00:31:55,864 --> 00:31:58,174
about Hugh Crain
that I didn't say.

385
00:31:58,424 --> 00:32:01,165
- May I ask you not to tell the women?
- Yeah, yeah.

386
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:04,612
- It's just I don't want
the tests disturbed.
- Okay, sure.

387
00:32:05,386 --> 00:32:07,414
Hey, you guys, wait up.

388
00:32:08,212 --> 00:32:11,818
Okay. You guys wanna hear
something really scary?
I just found this out.

389
00:32:13,145 --> 00:32:15,930
Turns out there's a darker chapter
to the Hugh Crain fairy tale.

390
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,938
Remember his
lovely wife, Rene?

391
00:32:17,958 --> 00:32:22,977
Well, Rene, the town beauty,
she didn't just die.
She killed herself.

392
00:32:23,237 --> 00:32:25,519
- Really? He just told you that?
- Yes.

393
00:32:25,539 --> 00:32:28,256
And you can't say anything, 'cause
he actually swore me to secrecy.

394
00:32:28,276 --> 00:32:31,178
- Why did she kill herself?
- Well, there are the stillborn children,

395
00:32:31,198 --> 00:32:33,055
although I like to think
it was more sinister,

396
00:32:33,075 --> 00:32:35,765
like maybe Hugh Crain was a horrible
monster and drove her to it.

397
00:32:35,785 --> 00:32:38,338
Monster? But he built this house
for the woman that he loved,

398
00:32:38,358 --> 00:32:39,607
like the Taj Mahal.

399
00:32:39,627 --> 00:32:42,398
The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace.
It was a tomb.

400
00:32:42,616 --> 00:32:44,541
And equally overdone.

401
00:32:45,851 --> 00:32:48,753
- Why didn't he tell us?
- Maybe he doesn't trust women.

402
00:32:49,245 --> 00:32:51,829
Yeah. I think
that's probably it.

403
00:32:51,849 --> 00:32:55,343
I think he knew that your fragile,
delicate sensibilities...

404
00:32:55,414 --> 00:32:59,612
After all, you know, I'm a man.
I can handle this kind of...

405
00:33:00,392 --> 00:33:01,894
How'd she kill herself?

406
00:33:02,293 --> 00:33:03,851
He didn't say.

407
00:33:05,158 --> 00:33:07,820
Oh, and ladies, sleep tight.

408
00:33:15,289 --> 00:33:19,438
After dinner and the first bland history
of Hill House successfully relayed,

409
00:33:19,809 --> 00:33:23,502
Miss Vance appears most susceptible
to suggestive history,

410
00:33:23,522 --> 00:33:27,439
evincing a strongly sentimental
reaction to the love-story component.

411
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:31,563
Mr. Sanderson, who tested at the
bottom of the Mogel Reliability Scale,

412
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:33,386
was given the second
part of the story.

413
00:33:33,668 --> 00:33:37,616
When he passes the story on, the
experimental haunting fiction...

414
00:33:37,909 --> 00:33:40,138
should manifest itself
within the group.

415
00:33:46,242 --> 00:33:48,664
And dear Mary
almost lost an eye.

416
00:34:20,137 --> 00:34:22,306
I like the way you comb
your hair like that.

417
00:34:29,812 --> 00:34:31,943
Here. This is for you.

418
00:34:32,645 --> 00:34:34,157
- For me?
- Yeah.

419
00:34:37,481 --> 00:34:38,673
It's beautiful.

420
00:34:40,744 --> 00:34:42,590
- No, I'll... I'll do it.
- It's okay.

421
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:44,651
It's okay.

422
00:34:45,524 --> 00:34:46,425
Mm-hmm.

423
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:55,274
- Looks good on you.
- Mm-hmm.

424
00:34:58,685 --> 00:35:01,455
You've been out of the world
a long time, haven't you?

425
00:35:02,788 --> 00:35:03,596
Yeah.

426
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,894
Well, the world's missed you.

427
00:35:12,939 --> 00:35:14,549
Happy tossing and turning.

428
00:35:50,462 --> 00:35:52,487
Eleanor.

429
00:36:08,314 --> 00:36:11,647
Now I lay me down to sleep.

430
00:36:11,718 --> 00:36:15,449
I pray the Lord
my soul to keep.

431
00:36:15,522 --> 00:36:18,685
If I should die before I wake,

432
00:36:18,758 --> 00:36:22,285
I pray the Lord
my soul to take.

433
00:36:35,213 --> 00:36:36,151
God!

434
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:40,176
- You scared the f...
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

435
00:36:40,196 --> 00:36:42,412
- Oh, you gotta be careful.
- You all right?

436
00:36:43,129 --> 00:36:45,664
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no, no, no.
You just don't jump out...

437
00:36:45,833 --> 00:36:48,662
- Are you all right?
- Uh, yeah. N-N-No. Oh!

438
00:36:48,682 --> 00:36:50,970
- What's with the, uh, glove?
- What?

439
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:53,948
- What's with the glove?
- No, I couldn't sleep.
I was just... Insomnia.

440
00:36:54,822 --> 00:36:56,559
- What's with...
- Ah, well...

441
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:59,587
- Yeah, you gotta be careful, 'cause I...
- I wasn't. I was just...

442
00:36:59,607 --> 00:37:01,448
No, I know. I'm sorry.
I just...

443
00:37:01,601 --> 00:37:04,338
- Oh!
- Um, interesting group, huh?

444
00:37:04,653 --> 00:37:07,601
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was good.
I like Theo. She's...

445
00:37:08,249 --> 00:37:09,967
quite an insomniac.

446
00:37:10,889 --> 00:37:13,556
Well, uh, listen, you should
try and get some sleep, huh?

447
00:37:13,655 --> 00:37:16,264
- Yeah, that's a good idea. All right.
- Okay. See you tomorrow.

448
00:37:16,284 --> 00:37:17,122
All right.

449
00:37:17,142 --> 00:37:18,958
- There's some good hallways that way.
- Uh-huh.

450
00:37:18,978 --> 00:37:21,109
- How's this one?
- Not bad.

451
00:37:21,129 --> 00:37:22,657
- Good. Good.
- See you tomorrow.

452
00:37:22,725 --> 00:37:23,852
Okay.

453
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:04,687
Coming, Mother.

454
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:08,170
I'm coming.

455
00:38:22,086 --> 00:38:23,481
Nell! Nell!

456
00:38:34,851 --> 00:38:36,924
Nell! Nell!

457
00:38:36,944 --> 00:38:38,468
- What is it?
- I don't know.

458
00:38:38,488 --> 00:38:40,447
- Where's it coming from?
- It's everywhere.

459
00:39:17,978 --> 00:39:19,903
Oh, my God. What's happening?

460
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:24,600
- Can you feel it, Nell?
- Mm-hmm.

461
00:39:26,256 --> 00:39:28,612
The cold, can you feel it?
Nell, can you feel it?

462
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:44,232
Nell?

463
00:39:51,172 --> 00:39:52,412
It's moving.

464
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:04,254
It's over.

465
00:40:05,794 --> 00:40:07,127
It's over, right?

466
00:40:14,553 --> 00:40:16,271
Nell, come back here.

467
00:40:26,516 --> 00:40:28,635
- Come back here!
- No, it's in my room.

468
00:40:28,655 --> 00:40:29,941
It's in my room.

469
00:40:36,364 --> 00:40:37,829
You guys all right?

470
00:40:38,899 --> 00:40:41,669
- Is everything okay?
- Oh, God.

471
00:40:42,528 --> 00:40:43,697
It's Luke.

472
00:40:51,203 --> 00:40:53,945
Hey, is everything okay?
You guys all right?

473
00:40:53,965 --> 00:40:54,771
Luke?

474
00:40:55,447 --> 00:40:56,366
Oh, God.

475
00:40:56,386 --> 00:40:57,661
- What's going on?
- Did you hear it?

476
00:40:57,681 --> 00:41:00,677
- Yeah, I just heard it.
- Was it part of the experiment?

477
00:41:00,697 --> 00:41:02,673
- Was what part of the experiment?
- The noise!

478
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:05,571
- What did you hear?
- Theo, all I heard
was you screaming,

479
00:41:05,591 --> 00:41:07,384
"Luke, help me, please."

480
00:41:09,515 --> 00:41:11,318
I wasn't screaming for you.

481
00:41:14,823 --> 00:41:17,227
It was in my room, and then
it went into Nell's room.

482
00:41:17,753 --> 00:41:19,062
Here, let me look.

483
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,608
- Are there any lights?
- Yes.

484
00:41:27,511 --> 00:41:30,111
I don't... I don't see anything.
I don't hear anything.

485
00:41:36,803 --> 00:41:39,496
Wow, I sort of got screwed on
the old bedroom selection.

486
00:41:39,516 --> 00:41:42,249
Every room's, like, four
times as big as mine.

487
00:41:54,393 --> 00:41:57,163
Is that it? Is that
what you heard?

488
00:41:57,576 --> 00:42:01,106
Well, I did just take a bath.
I mean, could've been.

489
00:42:01,915 --> 00:42:04,770
Yeah, but then how do you explain
the breath and the cold?

490
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:06,118
I don't know. A draft.

491
00:42:06,138 --> 00:42:08,444
Maybe someone left a
window open somewhere.

492
00:42:08,464 --> 00:42:10,568
The cold, who felt it first?

493
00:42:10,767 --> 00:42:13,171
- Oh, I think it was me.
- What difference does it make?

494
00:42:13,771 --> 00:42:16,960
Oh, Eleanor, if it was
you, did you say Theo?

495
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:20,388
- Theo, if it was you, did you...
- Look, I don't need anyone
to tell me I'm cold.

496
00:42:21,741 --> 00:42:25,140
Let's blame it on the
old plumbing then, huh?
What else could it be?

497
00:42:26,132 --> 00:42:28,699
Well, if you don't need me
anymore, I guess that's it.

498
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:32,009
- My job is done. Good night.
- Good night, Luke.

499
00:42:32,029 --> 00:42:34,211
- Yeah, me too.
- Yeah.

500
00:42:37,818 --> 00:42:40,094
- Will you two be all right?
- Yeah.

501
00:42:43,565 --> 00:42:45,396
You really didn't
hear anything?

502
00:42:47,527 --> 00:42:48,597
No.

503
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,118
Eleanor.

504
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:28,716
Eleanor.

505
00:44:32,058 --> 00:44:34,621
Find us, Eleanor.

506
00:44:35,407 --> 00:44:39,104
Oh, Eleanor.

507
00:44:39,305 --> 00:44:41,155
Find us.

508
00:45:45,246 --> 00:45:46,795
Okay.

509
00:46:10,439 --> 00:46:12,820
These carvings are
really creepy.

510
00:46:13,734 --> 00:46:18,227
All these fat little cherubs
and angels with furry animals.

511
00:46:18,247 --> 00:46:19,880
It's really bizarre, I think.

512
00:46:20,135 --> 00:46:22,650
I think they're the children
Hugh Crain built the house for.

513
00:46:22,785 --> 00:46:26,671
I don't buy that for a second... that
Hugh Crain was this lovable old tycoon...

514
00:46:26,691 --> 00:46:29,029
with a soft spot for kids.

515
00:46:29,431 --> 00:46:31,566
The guy was obviously
running a sweatshop.

516
00:46:31,586 --> 00:46:33,855
Had children working
16 hours a day,

517
00:46:34,016 --> 00:46:36,558
and then he builds all
this crap as propaganda.

518
00:46:37,077 --> 00:46:40,293
It's like those Teletubbies.
Those things freak me out also.

519
00:46:40,783 --> 00:46:43,938
And they sing, so they're actually even
kind of scarier, if you think about it.

520
00:46:44,098 --> 00:46:44,978
Yeah.

521
00:46:47,135 --> 00:46:50,053
- How are you comin' along?
- I can't get this one.

522
00:46:50,313 --> 00:46:53,708
- What about you?
- I did all right.
But that's another thing.

523
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:56,149
These tests. It's like, why
do we have to be here?

524
00:46:56,169 --> 00:46:58,085
Why do we have to be in
this weird old house?

525
00:46:58,237 --> 00:47:01,199
I like this house. I think
it's a beautiful house.

526
00:47:05,245 --> 00:47:06,527
Yeah, I guess.

527
00:47:07,732 --> 00:47:10,377
I don't know. I just think
Dr. Marrow's up to something.

528
00:47:10,693 --> 00:47:12,283
I'll tell you another thing.

529
00:47:12,543 --> 00:47:14,535
I'm gonna get to
the bottom of it,

530
00:47:14,683 --> 00:47:16,746
right after I check
on Theo, that is.

531
00:47:19,712 --> 00:47:21,702
See how my old pal
Theo's doing.

532
00:47:21,886 --> 00:47:24,913
- Doing or wearing?
- Yeah, no kidding.

533
00:47:25,163 --> 00:47:27,398
Did you see what she
had on yesterday?

534
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:32,401
Wow. Yeah, I definitely
got a soft spot for Theo.

535
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,920
Nell, I'm gonna shut this door
and give you a little privacy.

536
00:48:22,403 --> 00:48:25,412
- If there's anyone in there,
we'll find him.
- You just saw something move?

537
00:48:25,432 --> 00:48:27,921
- I saw something in the fireplace.
- Okay. Just relax.

538
00:48:27,941 --> 00:48:29,376
I know I did.

539
00:48:38,953 --> 00:48:40,219
You were here alone?

540
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:43,796
- Yeah, Luke had just left.
- I didn't see anything, though.

541
00:48:44,278 --> 00:48:45,919
Luke, can you help me?

542
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:20,623
- Just ashes.
- Charred wood.

543
00:49:22,839 --> 00:49:24,486
- Watch out. Let it go.
- Yep.

544
00:49:32,255 --> 00:49:33,935
Hello? Santa?

545
00:49:35,978 --> 00:49:38,335
- Whoa!
- Jesus! God!

546
00:49:38,355 --> 00:49:41,211
- God, are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

547
00:49:42,125 --> 00:49:43,810
- What is that?
- A flue.

548
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:46,228
- A what?
- It's... It's an old flue!

549
00:49:46,248 --> 00:49:48,343
It opens up the chimney.

550
00:49:50,285 --> 00:49:51,646
God!

551
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:54,566
Is this what you saw?

552
00:49:57,681 --> 00:50:00,094
No.
No, that's not what I saw.

553
00:50:02,977 --> 00:50:04,635
That is not what I saw.

554
00:50:05,174 --> 00:50:07,690
God. Hey, are you okay?

555
00:50:08,998 --> 00:50:11,623
- Luke, are you okay?
- What? No, I'm not okay!

556
00:50:11,643 --> 00:50:14,692
Did you not see that thing?
It almost crushed me.
- Yeah, I saw it.

557
00:50:14,712 --> 00:50:16,483
Jeez, I was only asking!

558
00:50:18,798 --> 00:50:21,660
That's what it was. Of
course you were scared.

559
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,359
- It scared the hell out of me too.
- I know what I saw.

560
00:50:24,379 --> 00:50:26,906
Eleanor, this is a
very confusing house.

561
00:50:26,926 --> 00:50:29,199
You said it yourself.
Nothing is what it seems.

562
00:50:29,219 --> 00:50:30,928
Look at me. I'm not confused.

563
00:50:31,138 --> 00:50:34,932
I saw something, and that wasn't it.
There was something in there.

564
00:50:38,058 --> 00:50:40,208
Hey, you guys should
take a look at this.

565
00:50:50,205 --> 00:50:52,139
"Welcome home, Eleanor"?

566
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:53,990
- Oh, God.
- What does that mean?

567
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:55,391
His face.

568
00:50:56,078 --> 00:50:59,552
It's my name. Who did this?

569
00:50:59,812 --> 00:51:01,145
Who wrote this?

570
00:51:02,408 --> 00:51:04,524
Is this one of your
sick jokes, Luke?

571
00:51:04,544 --> 00:51:07,102
What? Come on. Give
me a little credit.

572
00:51:07,122 --> 00:51:10,761
I think I have a better
sense of humor than that.
Do you really think I wrote that?

573
00:51:10,781 --> 00:51:12,235
You found it. You could have.

574
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:15,916
Oh, with what? With the 20-foot
ladder that I keep in my back pocket?

575
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:18,594
M-Maybe you wrote it, Theo!
You're the artist!

576
00:51:18,614 --> 00:51:20,069
- Maybe this is your great idea of art!
- Don't be ridiculous.

577
00:51:20,089 --> 00:51:23,929
I wanna know right now! Who wrote this?
Did you write this, Theo?

578
00:51:23,949 --> 00:51:26,719
No! Of course not!
Maybe it was you!

579
00:51:26,881 --> 00:51:29,118
How dare you accuse
me of writing this!

580
00:51:29,138 --> 00:51:31,307
Maybe you like being the
center of attention!

581
00:51:31,327 --> 00:51:35,111
- What are you talking about?
- Let's stop this now. Come on.

582
00:51:35,449 --> 00:51:36,585
Who was it?

583
00:51:41,463 --> 00:51:45,068
Whoever wrote
this, it's cruel.

584
00:51:47,889 --> 00:51:49,513
You don't know me.

585
00:52:05,048 --> 00:52:06,353
I didn't do it.

586
00:52:15,351 --> 00:52:16,504
Eleanor.

587
00:52:17,686 --> 00:52:19,207
Are you all right?

588
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:27,219
I know you think I did
it, but I didn't.

589
00:52:27,297 --> 00:52:30,343
- Look, people are always...
- No, I'm not making this stuff up.

590
00:52:31,207 --> 00:52:34,972
Hey, I know you all think I'm crazy
or doing this for attention. I'm not.

591
00:52:35,178 --> 00:52:39,705
For what it's worth, I believe
you're a very sensitive woman,

592
00:52:39,725 --> 00:52:42,598
and I believe that people have taken
advantage of you in the past.

593
00:52:45,749 --> 00:52:47,891
Hmm. "Welcome home."

594
00:52:49,011 --> 00:52:51,330
You'll never see it again.
Mr. Dudley's taking care of it.

595
00:52:51,471 --> 00:52:53,866
Come on. There's something
I want you to see.

596
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:04,370
- Oh, this is beautiful!
- Thought you'd like it.

597
00:53:05,819 --> 00:53:07,426
Well, I wonder what
happened to him.

598
00:53:07,505 --> 00:53:09,057
Yeah, yeah.

599
00:53:10,542 --> 00:53:11,997
Oh, violets...

600
00:53:12,758 --> 00:53:14,495
Somebody must've died here.

601
00:53:17,825 --> 00:53:18,971
Well.

602
00:53:20,252 --> 00:53:24,121
You know, all my life I've
been waiting for an adventure,

603
00:53:24,656 --> 00:53:27,090
and I thought it would
never happen to me.

604
00:53:28,555 --> 00:53:30,574
Adventures are for soldiers...

605
00:53:31,205 --> 00:53:33,790
or for the women the
bullfighters fall in love with.

606
00:53:35,102 --> 00:53:36,688
And here I am.

607
00:53:38,189 --> 00:53:40,133
Paintings are calling out to me,

608
00:53:41,541 --> 00:53:43,877
strange noises in the night,

609
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:47,023
and all it cost was
five gallons of gas.

610
00:53:52,252 --> 00:53:55,214
Do you really think that someone's
playing with you, Eleanor?

611
00:53:59,077 --> 00:54:00,892
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

612
00:54:01,136 --> 00:54:03,502
I can be a victim, or
I can be a volunteer.

613
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:05,661
I'm gonna be a volunteer.
Mm-hmm.

614
00:55:39,905 --> 00:55:44,029
Eleanor. Eleanor!

615
00:56:30,726 --> 00:56:33,410
Eleanor, find us.

616
00:57:07,955 --> 00:57:10,279
- Eleanor.
- Hmm?

617
00:57:11,158 --> 00:57:15,474
Eleanor, the ledger.
In the ledger.

618
00:57:15,494 --> 00:57:16,405
What?

619
00:57:33,395 --> 00:57:35,114
It's Crain's study.

620
00:57:45,961 --> 00:57:47,452
"Concord."

621
00:57:47,874 --> 00:57:50,344
Oh, his textile mills.

622
00:57:54,519 --> 00:57:56,627
"Man. Woman. Child."

623
00:57:56,928 --> 00:57:58,121
Child.

624
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:05,823
"Twelve years."

625
00:58:17,794 --> 00:58:19,338
"Eleven years.

626
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:21,151
Twelve years."

627
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:28,964
There's so many of them.

628
00:58:34,377 --> 00:58:35,823
"Ten years.

629
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:38,814
Twelve years."

630
00:58:41,007 --> 00:58:42,744
They died so young.

631
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,771
"Eleven years."

632
00:58:51,924 --> 00:58:53,727
What happened to you?

633
00:58:54,073 --> 00:58:55,823
- Theo!
- Okay, okay.

634
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:58,425
- Theo!
- Yeah, what?

635
00:58:58,816 --> 00:59:00,422
There's hundreds of them.

636
00:59:00,705 --> 00:59:04,613
- He kept records of everyone.
- I was havin' the best night's sleep of my life.

637
00:59:04,633 --> 00:59:05,747
I swear.

638
00:59:08,593 --> 00:59:11,159
The names, the dates
and the ages.

639
00:59:11,179 --> 00:59:13,504
The names... they're
crossed out.

640
00:59:13,903 --> 00:59:17,452
- It's dead children, Theo.
- Can we talk about this in the morning?

641
00:59:17,729 --> 00:59:19,532
They showed me. They...

642
00:59:21,776 --> 00:59:23,823
Oh, you're never gonna
believe how I found them.

643
00:59:26,353 --> 00:59:27,677
How'd you find them?

644
00:59:27,968 --> 00:59:30,099
The blood led me
to the bookcase.

645
00:59:35,258 --> 00:59:36,507
The blood?

646
00:59:36,909 --> 00:59:38,685
Little footprints in blood.

647
00:59:41,587 --> 00:59:43,769
Nell, I'm worried about you.

648
00:59:43,789 --> 00:59:46,577
Theo, the house, it's trying
to tell me something.

649
00:59:46,653 --> 00:59:49,225
No. You know what?

650
00:59:49,469 --> 00:59:52,848
Nell, you just gotta
get some sleep, okay?

651
00:59:53,304 --> 00:59:56,575
You've gotta sleep. Come on.
Go to bed.

652
01:00:27,813 --> 01:00:28,893
Okay.

653
01:00:30,179 --> 01:00:31,522
I'm listening.

654
01:02:32,347 --> 01:02:33,774
Dr. Marrow?

655
01:02:36,563 --> 01:02:37,933
Dr. Marrow?

656
01:02:44,766 --> 01:02:46,231
Dr. Marrow?

657
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:49,067
Dr. Marrow?

658
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:12,847
Eleanor Vance continues...

659
01:03:12,867 --> 01:03:15,495
her alienation of
the other subjects.

660
01:03:15,882 --> 01:03:18,622
It remains unclear what she
saw in the fireplace...

661
01:03:18,642 --> 01:03:22,210
and whether she truly believes
she did not deface the painting.

662
01:03:23,116 --> 01:03:25,456
Interview with Vance in
greenhouse yesterday...

663
01:03:25,476 --> 01:03:28,009
to ascertain the extent
of her self-delusion...

664
01:03:28,082 --> 01:03:31,368
was inconclusive,
due to subject's...

665
01:03:32,023 --> 01:03:33,621
emotional instability.

666
01:03:37,171 --> 01:03:39,396
Well, I think I know
how experiments work.

667
01:03:39,812 --> 01:03:42,573
Wait a second. Hold on.
Hold on, Theo.

668
01:03:42,809 --> 01:03:46,261
What about all the noises, and
the fireplace and the painting?

669
01:03:46,335 --> 01:03:49,050
- I think it's an old academic
"bait and switch," where...
- What?

670
01:03:49,070 --> 01:03:51,099
Where you pretend that
it's a study on insomnia,

671
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:53,993
but what he's really interested
in is seeing our reaction...

672
01:03:54,013 --> 01:03:56,871
- to these phenomenons
he's obviously behind.
- No.

673
01:03:57,826 --> 01:03:59,469
It's not Dr. Marrow.

674
01:04:00,451 --> 01:04:02,131
Oh, Nell, I've been...

675
01:04:02,351 --> 01:04:03,900
Are you all right?

676
01:04:04,973 --> 01:04:07,487
God, I've been looking
for you everywhere.

677
01:04:07,622 --> 01:04:09,368
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hmm.

678
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:12,027
It's not Dr. Marrow.

679
01:04:12,649 --> 01:04:15,259
Then who? Come on, Nell.
If it's not Dr. Marrow...

680
01:04:15,279 --> 01:04:17,315
If you don't think this is really
somehow part of the experiment,

681
01:04:17,335 --> 01:04:19,672
then why would you stay
here another second?

682
01:04:22,138 --> 01:04:24,403
'Cause home is where
the heart is.

683
01:04:34,451 --> 01:04:36,385
Oh, my God!

684
01:04:36,453 --> 01:04:38,872
- What is it?
- Oh, no.

685
01:04:39,132 --> 01:04:40,298
What?

686
01:04:41,592 --> 01:04:44,186
What, Nell? Nell!

687
01:04:51,303 --> 01:04:54,670
If it's not Dr. Marrow, that's
a pretty scary proposition.

688
01:04:57,142 --> 01:05:00,111
No, I'm not.
No, I'm not.

689
01:05:00,178 --> 01:05:02,169
I'm not making this up!

690
01:05:02,247 --> 01:05:05,978
No, I'm not.
I'm not, I know I'm...

691
01:05:06,051 --> 01:05:08,815
There is something...
There's something in here.

692
01:05:08,887 --> 01:05:11,685
I can prove it.
I can prove...
I know I can.

693
01:05:11,756 --> 01:05:13,690
Oh, I know it is.

694
01:05:56,436 --> 01:05:58,370
Carolyn.

695
01:06:05,145 --> 01:06:07,502
Carolyn was his second wife.

696
01:06:14,656 --> 01:06:18,096
Eleanor, the fireplace.

697
01:07:48,513 --> 01:07:51,321
Where?
Where are you?

698
01:07:51,390 --> 01:07:55,019
Where are you?
I'm here.
I hear you.

699
01:07:55,453 --> 01:07:58,641
Here...
That's where you are.

700
01:07:59,151 --> 01:08:01,949
Okay, I'll let you out.
I'll get you out.

701
01:08:01,969 --> 01:08:04,184
I-I will.
Okay.

702
01:08:07,574 --> 01:08:10,775
I'm gonna get you out. I will.
I'll get you out.

703
01:08:10,968 --> 01:08:13,777
I'm with you.
Don't worry.

704
01:08:13,845 --> 01:08:16,106
Oh!
What's that smell?

705
01:08:24,390 --> 01:08:26,794
I'm trying.
I'm trying.

706
01:08:45,542 --> 01:08:46,819
He killed them.

707
01:08:47,668 --> 01:08:49,912
- What?
- He killed them.

708
01:08:51,392 --> 01:08:54,866
The children from the mills.
It's just like you said.

709
01:08:55,188 --> 01:08:58,099
He wanted to fill the house
with the sounds of children.

710
01:08:58,526 --> 01:09:02,762
He took them from his mills
and he brought them here,
but he wouldn't let them go.

711
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:05,096
He would never let them go.

712
01:09:05,655 --> 01:09:08,512
And I found the skulls,
just like Carolyn did.

713
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:11,597
- Carolyn? Who's Carolyn?
- Killed who, Eleanor?

714
01:09:11,918 --> 01:09:14,870
- Listen, calm down, now.
- And he had a second wife.

715
01:09:17,009 --> 01:09:18,568
But he couldn't
hide his secret.

716
01:09:18,828 --> 01:09:20,455
You can never hide a secret.

717
01:09:22,177 --> 01:09:23,923
Carolyn found out
what he'd done.

718
01:09:24,977 --> 01:09:26,367
And now he wants me.

719
01:09:26,627 --> 01:09:29,329
Who?
Who wants you?
And why?

720
01:09:29,424 --> 01:09:31,892
- She's delusional.
- But what is happening to her?

721
01:09:31,912 --> 01:09:33,729
She's in a fugue state.
Let's get her to the sofa.

722
01:09:33,843 --> 01:09:36,863
- Wanted to...
fill the house with children, but...
- Get a blanket.

723
01:09:36,932 --> 01:09:39,806
- Come on.
- He turned into a monster.

724
01:09:39,826 --> 01:09:41,867
- It's okay, sweetheart. It's okay.
- No.

725
01:09:41,887 --> 01:09:46,319
Carolyn showed me in the
photograph where she hid 'em.

726
01:09:46,888 --> 01:09:49,007
And they're all locked
together in there.

727
01:09:49,078 --> 01:09:51,392
- He won't let them go.
- Eleanor, listen to me.

728
01:09:51,556 --> 01:09:54,692
Listen to me. Listen to me.
It's not true.

729
01:09:56,973 --> 01:09:58,691
He's still here.

730
01:09:59,478 --> 01:10:02,051
Hugh Crain is still
in the house.

731
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:05,148
- No.
- Yeah.

732
01:10:05,625 --> 01:10:08,788
I mean, what if she's right?
What if she's right?

733
01:10:09,239 --> 01:10:11,197
What are you sayin'?
Theo, it doesn't do any
good to talk about...

734
01:10:11,268 --> 01:10:13,293
- Stop. Stop! Stop!
- What if she's right?

735
01:10:13,662 --> 01:10:15,652
Now, listen to me, all of you.

736
01:10:17,641 --> 01:10:19,489
Let me explain
what's happening.

737
01:10:20,108 --> 01:10:23,508
You're participating in a study
on group fear and hysteria.

738
01:10:23,918 --> 01:10:26,707
What?
That's why you brought us here?
That's what this is all about?

739
01:10:26,854 --> 01:10:28,930
You brought us here to scare us?
Is that it?

740
01:10:29,714 --> 01:10:30,653
Yes.

741
01:10:31,442 --> 01:10:34,627
You're just waiting for her to
have a total nervous breakdown
before you said anything?

742
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:36,154
- No!
- What is your problem?

743
01:10:36,174 --> 01:10:39,586
I gave you the clues.
You created the story
as you were meant to.

744
01:10:39,664 --> 01:10:42,318
- But it's over. I'm pulling the plug.
- Oh, that...

745
01:10:43,436 --> 01:10:45,474
- None of this is real.
- No, it is real.

746
01:10:45,494 --> 01:10:47,162
- Eleanor!
- No
- It's not real.

747
01:10:47,182 --> 01:10:50,187
- You have to look at the
bones in the fireplace!
- It's not real!

748
01:10:50,207 --> 01:10:53,316
And then I saw...
I saw his wife, hanging
in the greenhouse!

749
01:10:53,336 --> 01:10:54,920
- I know I saw it!
- I'm sorry.

750
01:10:54,940 --> 01:10:57,745
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I brought
you here, all of you.

751
01:10:57,816 --> 01:11:00,376
The Dudleys will be here in the morning,
and then we can all go home at once.

752
01:11:00,452 --> 01:11:03,182
- No! I can't believe you're not gonna look.
- Okay, that's enough.

753
01:11:03,255 --> 01:11:06,713
- I'm taking her upstairs.
I think you've done enough.
- I'll help you.

754
01:11:11,330 --> 01:11:13,618
Because it was a
controlled experiment.

755
01:11:13,638 --> 01:11:15,300
A controlled experiment?

756
01:11:15,410 --> 01:11:17,778
She's in total shock!
You can't do that!

757
01:11:17,798 --> 01:11:20,301
- I told you, it wasn't
meant to be like this.
- Oh, come on.

758
01:11:20,373 --> 01:11:23,274
You don't care about us.
You don't care about insomnia.

759
01:11:23,343 --> 01:11:27,127
You just wanted to scare the
hell out of us so we'd fit
into your little test...

760
01:11:27,147 --> 01:11:30,507
- or model or whatever bullshit
you need to understand this!
- Oh, please! Okay!

761
01:11:30,710 --> 01:11:32,855
- You can't do it!
- Now, listen! You listen.

762
01:11:33,541 --> 01:11:37,183
I am trying to help people.
My field of study is
the science of fear.

763
01:11:37,203 --> 01:11:41,400
I try to understand why people
act the way they act, why they
feel the way they feel...

764
01:11:47,551 --> 01:11:49,166
You don't feel.

765
01:11:56,771 --> 01:11:58,122
Where are you going?

766
01:11:58,142 --> 01:12:00,472
I'm gonna find out what
Eleanor was talking about.

767
01:12:55,938 --> 01:12:57,906
What am I doing?

768
01:13:10,907 --> 01:13:11,996
Good night.

769
01:13:14,428 --> 01:13:17,590
Be right back.
I'll get you some tea.

770
01:14:57,004 --> 01:14:58,658
Oh, God, it's looking for me.

771
01:15:08,844 --> 01:15:11,244
Who was holding my hand?

772
01:15:28,186 --> 01:15:29,134
No.

773
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:43,411
No!

774
01:15:44,190 --> 01:15:45,270
No!

775
01:15:49,009 --> 01:15:50,972
I will not let you hurt a child!

776
01:16:31,167 --> 01:16:33,294
Luke! David!

777
01:16:34,587 --> 01:16:35,880
Dr. Marrow!

778
01:16:37,179 --> 01:16:38,268
Luke!

779
01:17:16,710 --> 01:17:19,235
Eleanor!

780
01:17:37,736 --> 01:17:39,694
No!
That's not me!

781
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:51,087
No!

782
01:17:53,692 --> 01:17:54,509
No!

783
01:17:55,845 --> 01:17:57,253
Who are you?

784
01:17:58,408 --> 01:17:59,586
Oh, no!

785
01:18:01,956 --> 01:18:03,762
Why do you want me?

786
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:08,081
Who am I?
Who am I?

787
01:18:08,531 --> 01:18:11,526
Why do you want me?
Why?

788
01:18:15,542 --> 01:18:19,297
Who am I?
What are you trying to tell me?

789
01:18:43,267 --> 01:18:46,399
Welcome home, Eleanor.

790
01:18:48,171 --> 01:18:51,391
Oh, no! No!

791
01:18:52,141 --> 01:18:55,167
It's not true.
No!

792
01:18:56,245 --> 01:18:59,738
- Eleanor?
- What?

793
01:18:59,817 --> 01:19:03,981
Eleanor, don't be afraid.

794
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:08,357
You can understand me?

795
01:19:08,425 --> 01:19:12,657
The doors, Eleanor.
Only the doors can hold him.

796
01:19:13,597 --> 01:19:17,890
Oh, no!
He's coming!

797
01:19:18,613 --> 01:19:20,237
What?
What's wrong?

798
01:19:29,122 --> 01:19:30,805
What do you want from me?

799
01:19:34,085 --> 01:19:36,553
Help us, Eleanor.
Help us.

800
01:19:36,621 --> 01:19:39,215
What?
What are you trying to tell me?

801
01:19:39,410 --> 01:19:42,546
What?
What do you want from me?

802
01:19:43,405 --> 01:19:45,217
What do you want me to do?

803
01:19:46,289 --> 01:19:47,330
Nell?

804
01:19:48,873 --> 01:19:52,577
- Nell!
- I'm gonna help you.

805
01:19:53,713 --> 01:19:56,079
I'm gonna help.
I'm almost there!

806
01:19:57,713 --> 01:19:58,520
Eleanor.

807
01:19:58,852 --> 01:20:01,252
- I wanna help you.
- Eleanor.

808
01:20:01,866 --> 01:20:04,946
Don't move.
Don't move.

809
01:20:08,734 --> 01:20:09,748
Oh, Nell.

810
01:20:14,275 --> 01:20:15,763
Just stay there.

811
01:20:40,596 --> 01:20:43,018
- Hold on, Eleanor. Hold on.
- Watch out! The cable!

812
01:20:43,038 --> 01:20:44,127
Look out!

813
01:20:48,392 --> 01:20:51,108
It's not gonna hold your weight there!
It's breaking apart!

814
01:20:52,266 --> 01:20:54,347
Don't move, now.
Don't move.

815
01:20:55,008 --> 01:20:56,088
Oh, my God.

816
01:21:00,965 --> 01:21:02,007
No!

817
01:21:23,614 --> 01:21:24,797
Oh, shit.

818
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:31,939
Eleanor, look at me.

819
01:21:33,156 --> 01:21:35,842
I need you to climb over and
step back on the platform.

820
01:21:35,912 --> 01:21:39,746
Come on. I want you
to come down with me.

821
01:21:39,816 --> 01:21:43,513
Climb over and step on the platform.
Can you do that?

822
01:21:43,990 --> 01:21:46,783
I can't.
The children, they need me.

823
01:21:47,243 --> 01:21:49,256
I have to join them.

824
01:21:50,257 --> 01:21:52,692
Please.
Please, trust me.

825
01:21:52,762 --> 01:21:54,696
Climb off the rail
onto the platform.

826
01:21:54,764 --> 01:21:56,959
- Come on. Come on.
- Just do it, Nell.

827
01:21:58,034 --> 01:21:59,037
Please?

828
01:22:10,714 --> 01:22:13,114
No! No!

829
01:22:15,911 --> 01:22:16,784
Hold on!

830
01:22:30,691 --> 01:22:31,583
Here.

831
01:22:32,103 --> 01:22:32,945
Here.

832
01:22:34,139 --> 01:22:35,254
Thank you.

833
01:22:49,423 --> 01:22:50,381
Hurry.

834
01:22:53,159 --> 01:22:56,484
- Come on. Come on.
- No. He won't let them go.

835
01:22:56,697 --> 01:22:58,547
Even now, he won't
let them go.

836
01:22:58,876 --> 01:23:01,148
- Come on. Come on. We have to go.
- No, he won't...

837
01:23:01,168 --> 01:23:03,226
- I won't leave you. I won't leave you.
- Okay.

838
01:23:17,443 --> 01:23:18,851
She doesn't look good.

839
01:23:19,626 --> 01:23:22,218
Hey, we wanna take her to
see a doctor, right now.

840
01:23:22,289 --> 01:23:24,223
I'm gonna take her to
see a real doctor.

841
01:23:24,291 --> 01:23:26,856
We'll take her to the
hospital in the morning.
The gate's still locked.

842
01:23:26,876 --> 01:23:28,929
We have to wait until
the Dudleys arrive.

843
01:23:28,949 --> 01:23:32,338
What?
That's real compassionate.

844
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:33,842
Yeah, let's wait
until the morning,

845
01:23:33,862 --> 01:23:35,872
and then maybe tonight you'll have
a chance to scribble a few more...

846
01:23:35,892 --> 01:23:38,735
- "Welcome home, Eleanor"s on the wall.
- I didn't write that stuff, okay?

847
01:23:38,755 --> 01:23:41,027
You'd never write that.
That wouldn't be ethical, would it?

848
01:23:41,149 --> 01:23:44,586
Will you guys just shut up?
Come on!

849
01:23:48,049 --> 01:23:51,485
Somebody's gonna have to
stay with her tonight.
We can't leave her alone.

850
01:23:53,855 --> 01:23:56,255
All right, I'll take
the first watch.

851
01:23:58,384 --> 01:23:59,483
Okay.

852
01:24:01,729 --> 01:24:04,789
The, uh, environment is proving
entirely successful...

853
01:24:04,866 --> 01:24:07,164
in promoting shared
hysteria reactions.

854
01:24:07,235 --> 01:24:09,466
The group is manifesting...

855
01:24:09,730 --> 01:24:13,495
manifesting classic
pathologies of trauma and...

856
01:24:18,113 --> 01:24:20,455
I should have stopped
this when Mary got hurt,

857
01:24:22,284 --> 01:24:24,325
and definitely when
Eleanor was...

858
01:24:27,509 --> 01:24:29,725
Jesus, I need to get
them out of here.

859
01:24:57,711 --> 01:24:59,082
What happened?

860
01:25:01,176 --> 01:25:02,538
What happened?

861
01:25:44,402 --> 01:25:46,962
It's nothin'.
It's not real.

862
01:26:57,894 --> 01:26:58,917
It's Nell!

863
01:27:00,187 --> 01:27:01,004
Nell!

864
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:04,478
Nell! Nell!

865
01:27:15,867 --> 01:27:18,056
Dr. Marrow!
Dr. Marrow!

866
01:27:18,984 --> 01:27:21,116
- What's going on?
- I can't get the door!

867
01:27:24,805 --> 01:27:25,941
Stay away!

868
01:27:27,142 --> 01:27:29,158
- Nell!
- Eleanor!

869
01:27:29,418 --> 01:27:31,264
- Eleanor!
- We're here!

870
01:27:31,837 --> 01:27:32,877
Eleanor!

871
01:27:32,948 --> 01:27:34,883
- Push!
- Come on!

872
01:27:44,766 --> 01:27:46,212
Oh, my God!

873
01:27:47,530 --> 01:27:49,713
Nell!
Quick! Come on!

874
01:27:49,733 --> 01:27:51,321
We gotta get her out of here.

875
01:27:55,269 --> 01:27:56,631
Oh, God!

876
01:27:59,119 --> 01:28:00,274
Hurry up!

877
01:28:05,859 --> 01:28:07,784
- Get out of the way!
- That's it.

878
01:28:11,461 --> 01:28:13,668
That's it.
Come on! Hit it!

879
01:28:18,776 --> 01:28:20,803
- Come on!
- Come on, Nell! Come on!

880
01:28:20,823 --> 01:28:21,753
Come here!

881
01:28:22,556 --> 01:28:23,382
Get up!

882
01:28:23,764 --> 01:28:26,598
Come on! Pick her up!
We gotta go! Move!

883
01:28:29,812 --> 01:28:31,446
Move! Let's go!

884
01:28:32,398 --> 01:28:36,036
Come on! I'm not staying in this
freak house another second! Come on!

885
01:28:38,287 --> 01:28:39,433
Get it open!

886
01:28:42,818 --> 01:28:44,950
- Come on!
- I can't get up there!

887
01:28:45,119 --> 01:28:46,781
Hurry up!
Come on!

888
01:28:48,665 --> 01:28:49,791
Oh, God!

889
01:28:59,117 --> 01:29:03,230
Dr. Marrow... How did you
know the house wanted me?

890
01:29:03,583 --> 01:29:04,907
What do you mean?

891
01:29:05,224 --> 01:29:07,346
Why did you call and tell
me to look for your ad?

892
01:29:07,517 --> 01:29:10,009
Ad? But... I didn't call you.

893
01:29:11,053 --> 01:29:12,780
You told me to
look in the paper.

894
01:29:13,813 --> 01:29:16,508
Eleanor, the first time I spoke
to you was here at the house.

895
01:29:24,465 --> 01:29:26,525
- God!
- What do we do?

896
01:29:27,254 --> 01:29:28,963
We gotta crash the gate.

897
01:29:32,039 --> 01:29:35,229
We gotta crash the gate.
Nell, I need your car.

898
01:29:45,513 --> 01:29:47,514
Move! Get out of the way!

899
01:29:52,979 --> 01:29:53,803
Luke!

900
01:30:01,215 --> 01:30:04,633
- Luke, are you okay?
- Get out! Get out!
- Open the door!

901
01:30:06,951 --> 01:30:08,221
Eleanor!

902
01:30:09,757 --> 01:30:10,963
Luke!

903
01:30:13,646 --> 01:30:17,599
- Eleanor... please come back!
- You gotta get out! Push the door!

904
01:30:18,672 --> 01:30:19,913
Turn the engine off.

905
01:30:19,933 --> 01:30:22,488
Push the door! You
gotta get out!

906
01:30:22,508 --> 01:30:25,328
- Turn the engine off!
- Luke, turn off the engine!

907
01:30:25,844 --> 01:30:29,675
- It won't go!
- Luke, you gotta get out!

908
01:30:30,644 --> 01:30:32,008
Stand back!

909
01:30:32,418 --> 01:30:33,968
Hurry up! Come on!

910
01:30:43,778 --> 01:30:45,919
- Grab my arm!
- You okay?

911
01:30:46,295 --> 01:30:48,689
Are you okay? You hurt?
Come on!

912
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:55,862
- Are you okay?
- Oh, my God.

913
01:30:57,665 --> 01:30:58,998
Where's Nell?

914
01:31:02,266 --> 01:31:04,200
- Eleanor?
- Come on. This is crazy.

915
01:31:04,268 --> 01:31:06,596
- Maybe she doesn't want to be found.
- Nell?

916
01:31:14,277 --> 01:31:15,535
Eleanor?

917
01:31:16,948 --> 01:31:18,670
Listen.
Listen.

918
01:31:22,870 --> 01:31:24,560
Oh, she's in there.

919
01:31:35,465 --> 01:31:36,291
Nell?

920
01:31:40,147 --> 01:31:41,133
Eleanor?

921
01:31:44,781 --> 01:31:46,011
Go get her.

922
01:31:53,235 --> 01:31:54,519
Oh, Nell.

923
01:31:56,456 --> 01:31:57,510
Hey.

924
01:31:59,349 --> 01:32:02,056
Come on, sweetheart. You're
gonna have to come with us now.

925
01:32:02,316 --> 01:32:05,396
- No, I can't do that, Theo.
- Of course you can.

926
01:32:06,502 --> 01:32:09,197
We're gonna go to your apartment,
just you and me, and...

927
01:32:09,625 --> 01:32:13,319
We'll sit and we'll listen
to the buoy in the harbor.
Can we do that, Nell?

928
01:32:13,339 --> 01:32:15,864
That sounds so beautiful, Eleanor.

929
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:19,289
Theo's saying anything she can.
You know I don't have an apartment.

930
01:32:19,458 --> 01:32:21,775
Then we'll go to my loft...
in the city.

931
01:32:22,061 --> 01:32:24,621
You're gonna love it there, I promise.
Come on, Nell. Please?

932
01:32:24,881 --> 01:32:25,977
No.

933
01:32:26,587 --> 01:32:28,521
I'm right where I'm wanted.

934
01:32:30,394 --> 01:32:31,628
I'm home.

935
01:32:31,888 --> 01:32:32,834
I'm home.

936
01:32:32,854 --> 01:32:35,436
Dr. Marrow, please, we don't
have time to baby talk.

937
01:32:39,199 --> 01:32:41,279
You see, this is the room...

938
01:32:41,299 --> 01:32:43,731
where Carolyn had her
baby before she ran away.

939
01:32:43,939 --> 01:32:48,069
And the children, they wanted
me to see this so I would know
this was my home.

940
01:32:49,492 --> 01:32:50,572
Oh, my God.

941
01:32:51,227 --> 01:32:54,654
Yes.
See, Carolyn was my
great-great grandmother,

942
01:32:55,254 --> 01:32:57,151
and the children are my family.

943
01:32:57,808 --> 01:32:59,329
This is where I belong.

944
01:33:00,133 --> 01:33:03,249
I have to stay.
I'm not afraid anymore.

945
01:33:03,559 --> 01:33:05,925
I have to stay for the children.
They need me.

946
01:33:06,761 --> 01:33:07,813
No.

947
01:33:10,976 --> 01:33:12,581
Nell, the children are dead.

948
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:14,392
No.
Not for him.

949
01:33:14,695 --> 01:33:17,465
He's still haunting them.
But if I'm here,

950
01:33:17,971 --> 01:33:19,435
he can't harm them.

951
01:33:21,384 --> 01:33:23,461
Nell, please! We have to go!
Just grab her!

952
01:33:23,481 --> 01:33:25,682
You have to go now.
You can't stay.

953
01:33:25,767 --> 01:33:28,312
- Come on.
- I'll take you outside.
You're not safe here.

954
01:33:28,332 --> 01:33:29,814
Hurry!
Come on!

955
01:33:47,695 --> 01:33:48,954
Come on!
Hurry!

956
01:33:58,392 --> 01:33:59,237
No!

957
01:34:01,331 --> 01:34:03,094
He's not gonna let you go!

958
01:34:07,038 --> 01:34:08,371
It's too late.

959
01:34:09,597 --> 01:34:11,240
He's not gonna let you go.

960
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:16,162
The hell he's not.
I'm getting us out of here.
Come on.

961
01:34:34,233 --> 01:34:35,472
Open up!

962
01:34:38,524 --> 01:34:41,823
- Come on! Open up!
- Come on!

963
01:34:46,495 --> 01:34:47,734
This is insane!

964
01:34:54,917 --> 01:34:56,732
There's got to be
another way out.

965
01:34:56,810 --> 01:34:59,506
Oh, Jesus! Oh, God, he's
got glass in his hand.

966
01:34:59,579 --> 01:35:01,479
- Here, wait.
- Get it out.

967
01:35:02,024 --> 01:35:03,905
- Just pull it. Just pull it.
- Oh, Jesus.

968
01:35:04,244 --> 01:35:05,840
- Just pull.
- Okay.

969
01:35:07,402 --> 01:35:08,576
Wrap it up.

970
01:35:09,492 --> 01:35:12,487
You bastard!
Son of a bitch!

971
01:35:13,774 --> 01:35:14,929
Damn you!

972
01:35:16,482 --> 01:35:18,079
Luke, don't!

973
01:35:19,281 --> 01:35:20,802
- What?
- Don't!

974
01:35:26,687 --> 01:35:28,307
I'm gonna burn the house down.

975
01:35:28,375 --> 01:35:31,003
Come on!
Let's burn it down, right now!

976
01:35:37,949 --> 01:35:39,757
Oh, my God!
Luke!

977
01:35:41,285 --> 01:35:44,152
- Get off!
- Luke, get off! Get off!

978
01:35:57,426 --> 01:36:00,081
Oh, my God!
Luke, get out now!
Luke!

979
01:36:09,297 --> 01:36:10,686
Oh, no!

980
01:36:31,168 --> 01:36:33,689
We can't get out.
Why won't he let us leave?

981
01:36:33,709 --> 01:36:36,710
- What do we do, Eleanor?
- He played hide-and-seek with them.

982
01:36:36,730 --> 01:36:39,555
That's why he built the house.
You have to hide.

983
01:36:40,177 --> 01:36:43,276
Hide?
What does he think this is, a game?

984
01:36:43,631 --> 01:36:46,730
- What's going to happen?
- Why does he want us?

985
01:36:48,138 --> 01:36:50,007
No!
Watch out!

986
01:36:53,195 --> 01:36:54,848
Oh... oh!

987
01:36:58,245 --> 01:37:00,508
No!
You're not gonna hurt them!

988
01:37:02,752 --> 01:37:03,709
Get away!

989
01:37:08,826 --> 01:37:09,906
Go, Theo!

990
01:37:13,352 --> 01:37:15,249
- Go!
- Follow us! Follow us!

991
01:37:23,698 --> 01:37:24,966
Theo!

992
01:37:26,525 --> 01:37:27,736
Theo!

993
01:38:18,419 --> 01:38:20,016
Hugh Crain!

994
01:39:04,466 --> 01:39:06,400
Hugh Crain!

995
01:39:43,072 --> 01:39:45,209
The doors, Eleanor.

996
01:39:45,229 --> 01:39:47,867
Bring him to the doors.

997
01:39:53,450 --> 01:39:58,319
- The doors, Eleanor. The doors.
- Hugh Crain!

998
01:40:54,736 --> 01:40:57,525
Nell! Nell!
What happened?

999
01:40:58,618 --> 01:41:00,961
- Where were you?
- Eleanor, are you all right?

1000
01:41:04,303 --> 01:41:05,486
No!

1001
01:41:05,943 --> 01:41:07,894
You leave them alone!

1002
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:11,168
I'm not afraid anymore.
I'm not afraid of you.

1003
01:41:11,487 --> 01:41:14,830
The children need me, and
I'm gonna set them free!

1004
01:41:14,850 --> 01:41:17,234
No...

1005
01:41:17,836 --> 01:41:20,502
Even in death, you still
wouldn't let them go!

1006
01:41:22,844 --> 01:41:25,369
Eleanor, move away.
Move away!

1007
01:41:28,860 --> 01:41:31,667
- I'm gonna stop you now.
- Don't!

1008
01:41:46,499 --> 01:41:49,162
Don't do it, Eleanor!
He's gonna kill you!

1009
01:41:52,490 --> 01:41:55,333
It's not about them.
It's about family.

1010
01:41:55,410 --> 01:41:57,640
It's always been about family!

1011
01:42:00,716 --> 01:42:04,331
It's about Carolyn... and the
children from the mills,

1012
01:42:04,351 --> 01:42:07,850
so you could hear their voices... family.

1013
01:42:08,256 --> 01:42:11,583
Well, I'm family, Grandpa,
and I've come home.

1014
01:42:13,010 --> 01:42:16,056
No, you're not!

1015
01:42:16,430 --> 01:42:19,124
Now, it's just you
and me, Hugh Crain.

1016
01:42:22,805 --> 01:42:25,672
Purgatory's over.
You go to hell!

1017
01:42:26,357 --> 01:42:28,669
Stay with us, Nell!

1018
01:42:33,249 --> 01:42:35,514
No!

1019
01:43:06,718 --> 01:43:10,620
No!

1020
01:43:20,198 --> 01:43:22,504
Thank you, Eleanor.

1021
01:43:24,579 --> 01:43:26,326

1026

Thank you...

1027
01:44:21,487 --> 01:44:23,083
Oh, Nell.

1028
01:45:31,835 --> 01:45:33,206
Jesus.

1029
01:45:48,231 --> 01:45:49,752
City people.

1030
01:45:56,827 --> 01:45:59,973
Did you find out what you
wanted to know, Doctor?
