Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016)^(Run time 02:23:35)

2
00:00:16,258 --> 00:00:18,926
There was a time above...

3
00:00:18,951 --> 00:00:21,500
A time before...

4
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:24,468
There were perfect things.

5
00:00:24,493 --> 00:00:27,236
Diamond absolutes.

6
00:00:27,636 --> 00:00:29,929
But things fall...

7
00:00:30,361 --> 00:00:32,439
Things on Earth,

8
00:00:33,029 --> 00:00:35,173
and what falls...

9
00:00:35,198 --> 00:00:38,263
- <i>... is fallen.</i>
- Master Wayne.  Bruce!

10
00:00:39,765 --> 00:00:41,765
Bruce, are you alright.

11
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,530
Martha...

12
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,150
In the dream,
they took me to the light.

13
00:04:44,355 --> 00:04:46,934
A beautiful lie.

14
00:04:46,935 --> 00:04:49,167
METROPOLIS

15
00:04:49,168 --> 00:04:53,270
METROPOLIS
HUMANITY KNOWS SUPERMAN

16
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,193
- Jack.
- Bruce.

17
00:05:33,194 --> 00:05:34,292
Jack, listen to me.

18
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:37,078
I want you to get everyone
out of the building. Right now.

19
00:05:37,284 --> 00:05:38,965
You understand?

20
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,741
Let's go.
Come on, start moving now, people.

21
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:43,222
Let's go.
The boss wants us out

22
00:05:43,223 --> 00:05:45,306
of the building.
So, let's make it happen.

23
00:05:45,307 --> 00:05:47,953
Jack.
Jack!

24
00:07:27,817 --> 00:07:31,023
We're sorry.
All services are busy now.

25
00:07:31,024 --> 00:07:34,143
Will you please try
you call again later.

26
00:07:35,267 --> 00:07:36,976
Heaven god.

27
00:07:37,897 --> 00:07:40,161
Creator of heaven and earth.

28
00:07:40,887 --> 00:07:43,002
Have mercy on my soul.

29
00:07:46,153 --> 00:07:47,928
JACK !!!

30
00:08:21,011 --> 00:08:23,682
Mr. Wayne!
Mr. Wayne!

31
00:08:23,683 --> 00:08:25,490
I can't feel my legs.

32
00:08:25,491 --> 00:08:28,912
- I can't feel my legs.
- We need help over here!

33
00:08:29,068 --> 00:08:30,725
Help me.
I can't feel my legs.

34
00:08:30,726 --> 00:08:33,047
You're going to be okay,
you hear me?

35
00:08:33,048 --> 00:08:35,071
Wallace.
What do they call you, Wally?

36
00:08:35,072 --> 00:08:36,445
Huh?

37
00:08:37,613 --> 00:08:39,739
You're the boss, Boss.

38
00:08:40,142 --> 00:08:41,558
Alright.

39
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,019
- You're going to be okay.
- Easy, easy.

40
00:08:43,044 --> 00:08:44,403
Come on.

41
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,519
Oh my god.
I can't feel my legs.

42
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,275
I can't...
I can't feel my legs.

43
00:08:59,744 --> 00:09:02,174
It's okay.
You're going to be okay.

44
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:05,166
You're okay, alright.
Huh.

45
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:07,545
Okay, you know what?
We're going to find your mom.

46
00:09:07,546 --> 00:09:09,352
Where is she?

47
00:09:47,997 --> 00:09:51,757
18 MONTHS LATER

48
00:10:01,389 --> 00:10:05,011
<font color="#80ffff">SOMEWHERE IN THE INDIAN OCEAN</font>

49
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:12,437
NAIROMI, AFRICA

50
00:11:41,824 --> 00:11:44,756
Are you a terrorist, general?

51
00:11:44,757 --> 00:11:47,702
They did not tell me
the interview was with a lady.

52
00:11:47,703 --> 00:11:50,286
I'm not a lady,
I'm a journalist.

53
00:11:52,974 --> 00:11:56,543
What I am,
is a man with nothing,

54
00:11:56,544 --> 00:11:59,321
except a love of my people.

55
00:11:59,322 --> 00:12:01,023
Uh, don't open...

56
00:12:01,024 --> 00:12:02,891
You just exposed...

57
00:12:02,892 --> 00:12:06,439
Who's paying for these
security contractors, general?

58
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:11,366
Who pays for the drones that
passed over our heads at night?

59
00:12:11,367 --> 00:12:13,577
One question begs another.

60
00:12:13,578 --> 00:12:14,982
Yes?

61
00:12:27,882 --> 00:12:29,651
CIA.

62
00:12:30,094 --> 00:12:32,056
They're tracking us.

63
00:12:37,118 --> 00:12:38,514
No!

64
00:12:38,615 --> 00:12:40,010
Not her.

65
00:12:40,011 --> 00:12:42,222
We just used her credentials as cover.

66
00:12:42,223 --> 00:12:43,715
She doesn't know anything.

67
00:12:43,716 --> 00:12:45,738
It's okay, Lois.

68
00:12:55,634 --> 00:12:56,984
I...

69
00:12:57,449 --> 00:12:58,966
I didn't know.

70
00:12:58,967 --> 00:13:02,485
Ignorance
is not the same...

71
00:13:02,793 --> 00:13:06,090
as innocence.
Miss Lane.

72
00:13:27,383 --> 00:13:28,873
Get up!

73
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,709
Stand up!

74
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:40,714
Move out!

75
00:14:01,573 --> 00:14:05,629
Take 1 step,
you will see the inside of her head.

76
00:14:21,336 --> 00:14:24,768
The women in the village
heard a noise.

77
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:29,475
Like the sky
crack open.

78
00:14:29,783 --> 00:14:34,713
He came down,
so many dead.

79
00:14:35,944 --> 00:14:38,495
Even worse came after.

80
00:14:38,496 --> 00:14:40,833
The government attacked.

81
00:14:40,834 --> 00:14:43,693
No mercy in the villages.

82
00:14:44,229 --> 00:14:47,329
My parents tried to run...

83
00:14:50,606 --> 00:14:53,899
The world has been so caught up
with what Superman can do,

84
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:58,050
that...
no one has asked what he should do.

85
00:14:59,451 --> 00:15:02,669
Let the record show that
this committee holds him responsible.

86
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:05,041
He'll never answer to you.

87
00:15:05,042 --> 00:15:07,547
He answers to no one.

88
00:15:07,548 --> 00:15:10,661
Not even I think, to god.

89
00:16:13,323 --> 00:16:15,184
- Hey.
- Hey.

90
00:16:15,185 --> 00:16:18,855
I was going to cook.
Surprise you.

91
00:16:22,771 --> 00:16:25,889
They held hearings about what happened.

92
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,706
- They're saying that...
- I don't care.

93
00:16:28,707 --> 00:16:31,610
I don't care
what they're saying.

94
00:16:32,316 --> 00:16:34,878
The woman I love could have
been blown up or shot

95
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:38,405
- Think of what could have happened.
- Well, think about what did happen.

96
00:16:38,701 --> 00:16:40,598
I didn't kill those men if
that's what they think.

97
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:41,986
If that's what you're saying?

98
00:16:41,987 --> 00:16:45,961
I'm saying I want to
understand what happened.

99
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,617
I'm saying,
thank you for saving my life.

100
00:16:48,618 --> 00:16:51,345
I'm saying there's a cost.

101
00:16:59,331 --> 00:17:02,168
I just don't know
if it's possible.

102
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:04,955
Don't know what's possible?

103
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,171
For you to love me
and be you.

104
00:17:36,601 --> 00:17:38,835
Clark, you're going to
flood the apartment.

105
00:17:38,836 --> 00:17:40,509
Mmm-hmm.

106
00:18:03,636 --> 00:18:08,237
There has been a report of screaming
at location 1939 Harbor Way

107
00:18:08,238 --> 00:18:10,625
Possible shots fired.

108
00:18:24,694 --> 00:18:26,173
Go.

109
00:18:33,807 --> 00:18:35,708
It saved us.

110
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,833
A devil.

111
00:18:39,112 --> 00:18:40,380
It's okay.

112
00:18:40,381 --> 00:18:43,563
It's okay.
We're-We're going to help.

113
00:18:43,564 --> 00:18:44,839
It saved us.

114
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,629
Okay, we're going to
get you out of here.

115
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,018
Okay?

116
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,107
It's still here.

117
00:18:57,108 --> 00:18:59,621
I - I don't understand.

118
00:20:19,917 --> 00:20:21,446
AH!

119
00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:23,100
Christ!

120
00:20:23,101 --> 00:20:24,831
I saw him.

121
00:20:24,832 --> 00:20:26,525
I never saw him before.
I didn't know...

122
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:28,254
You almost took my face off.

123
00:20:28,255 --> 00:20:30,989
How about you don't shoot
the good guys, huh?

124
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:36,070
Oh.
Jesus Christ.

125
00:20:36,071 --> 00:20:38,302
He branded him.

126
00:20:54,093 --> 00:20:55,812
Still working.

127
00:20:56,061 --> 00:20:58,498
You're getting slow in
your old age, Alfred.

128
00:20:58,499 --> 00:21:01,478
It comes to us all,
master Wayne.

129
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,473
Even you got too old to die young,

130
00:21:06,063 --> 00:21:09,644
and not for lack of trying.

131
00:21:10,489 --> 00:21:14,522
Funnel, fairy, bubblebath.
Funnel, fairy, bubblebath.

132
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:17,055
There's nothing wrong
with the microphone.

133
00:21:17,056 --> 00:21:20,202
It's this new layer or armor.

134
00:21:20,203 --> 00:21:22,825
I'll just have to rewire.

135
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:28,173
So...
last night was productive?

136
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:31,929
Nope. He's too low level,
he knew nothing.

137
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:34,957
This, is a man who knows things.

138
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:38,768
Anatoli Knyazev.
He's Russian.

139
00:21:38,769 --> 00:21:41,782
Contracts all over the globe but
he's base out of the port of Gotham.

140
00:21:41,783 --> 00:21:43,532
Weapons and human trafficking.

141
00:21:43,533 --> 00:21:46,577
So, the "White Portuguese" is a Russian,
that's the theory.

142
00:21:46,578 --> 00:21:48,061
No.

143
00:21:48,062 --> 00:21:52,090
The theory is that the Russian
lead me to the man himself.

144
00:21:52,091 --> 00:21:56,126
If he is indeed a him.

145
00:21:56,127 --> 00:21:59,047
You don't know if he exist.
He could be a phantasm.

146
00:21:59,048 --> 00:22:02,298
One that wants to bring
a dirty bomb into Gotham?

147
00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:04,910
Ah, high state front.

148
00:22:07,829 --> 00:22:09,739
New rules.

149
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,026
Gotham Free Press
BAT BRAND OF JUSTICE!

150
00:22:12,068 --> 00:22:13,747
We're criminals, Alfred.

151
00:22:13,748 --> 00:22:16,281
We've always been criminals,
nothing's change.

152
00:22:16,282 --> 00:22:19,320
Oh.
Yes it has, sir.

153
00:22:20,967 --> 00:22:23,711
Everything's change.

154
00:22:27,301 --> 00:22:30,261
Men fall from the sky.

155
00:22:30,262 --> 00:22:33,731
and gods hurl thunderbolts.

156
00:22:33,732 --> 00:22:36,510
Innocents die.

157
00:22:37,034 --> 00:22:39,515
That's how it starts.

158
00:22:39,516 --> 00:22:45,474
The fever, the rage,
the feeling of... powerlessness

159
00:22:46,415 --> 00:22:51,586
 that turns good men...
cruel.

160
00:22:57,208 --> 00:23:01,597
Justice turn dark across the harbor
when police found an alleged sex trafficker

161
00:23:01,598 --> 00:23:04,827
apparently tortured and branded
by the Gotham bat.

162
00:23:04,828 --> 00:23:07,588
The man is the second criminal
found baring the bat brand.

163
00:23:07,589 --> 00:23:11,467
The first victim, an accused child predator
later was assaulted in prison

164
00:23:11,468 --> 00:23:14,090
and remains in critical care
from his injuries.

165
00:23:14,091 --> 00:23:16,411
One source tells Metropolis,
that many believed

166
00:23:16,412 --> 00:23:21,549
the mark of the Bat brand in prison
essentially is a death sentence.

167
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:26,020
In other news, the mayor
has announced that Metroplis...

168
00:23:26,284 --> 00:23:28,393
Frank, your D!
(Defense)

169
00:23:28,769 --> 00:23:29,861
Woo.
Ah!

170
00:23:29,862 --> 00:23:31,781
A hoi hoi.
I didn't know you were here.

171
00:23:31,782 --> 00:23:33,631
- Man on the marquee.
- Stop, don't believe it.

172
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:36,467
My father named the company after himself.
He was the Lex in front of the Corp.

173
00:23:36,468 --> 00:23:38,663
- Hi, how are you doing?
- Oh, really great.

174
00:23:38,664 --> 00:23:40,537
Really great?
Good. Good.

175
00:23:40,538 --> 00:23:42,295
Uh.
Follow me.

176
00:23:42,367 --> 00:23:44,610
You know, Dad was born
in east Germany.

177
00:23:44,611 --> 00:23:47,021
He grew up eating uh...
stale crackers.

178
00:23:47,022 --> 00:23:49,269
And every other Saturday,
he had to march in a parade

179
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:51,372
and waved flowers at tyrants.

180
00:23:51,373 --> 00:23:54,670
So, I think it was providence
that his son,

181
00:23:54,671 --> 00:23:56,612
me, would end up with this.

182
00:23:56,613 --> 00:23:59,097
One of my rebuild Metropolis crews
found it.

183
00:23:59,098 --> 00:24:01,742
A little souvenir from
the Kryptonian World Engine.

184
00:24:01,743 --> 00:24:04,020
What's a rock have to do
with Homeland Security.

185
00:24:04,021 --> 00:24:05,804
Homeland Security?
Mmm.

186
00:24:05,805 --> 00:24:08,869
No, no, no... ma'am.
Planetary Security.

187
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:11,375
The fragment is of a
radioactive Xeno mineral

188
00:24:11,376 --> 00:24:13,804
We suspected it might have
bio interactions,

189
00:24:13,829 --> 00:24:16,815
so, we took the sample
to AMRIID.

190
00:24:17,076 --> 00:24:20,655
Where they keep the remains
of the Kryptonian decedent.

191
00:24:20,656 --> 00:24:24,085
And, when we exposed
general Zod to the mineral,

192
00:24:24,086 --> 00:24:25,779
this happened.

193
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:30,346
Profound biodegradation,
decaying Kryptonian cells.

194
00:24:30,347 --> 00:24:33,559
We concluded the mineral could be weaponized,
if a large enough sample was found.

195
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,715
And then, among the fishes,
a whale!

196
00:24:38,318 --> 00:24:41,134
Lying at the bottom
of the Indian Ocean,

197
00:24:41,135 --> 00:24:43,044
Emerald City.

198
00:24:43,683 --> 00:24:45,090
Beautiful.

199
00:24:45,091 --> 00:24:47,048
Now, Rocky is radioactive,
but,

200
00:24:47,049 --> 00:24:50,301
what he needs from you
is an import license.

201
00:24:50,302 --> 00:24:52,850
And why would we
want to weaponize this material?

202
00:24:52,851 --> 00:24:55,126
As a deterrent.
A silver bullet to keep in reserve

203
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:57,865
to use against the Kryptonians.
So, the day doesn't come, Madame.

204
00:24:57,866 --> 00:25:00,163
when your children are waving daisies
at a reviewing stand.

205
00:25:00,164 --> 00:25:02,020
Last I looked,
the only one of those

206
00:25:02,021 --> 00:25:03,746
flying around up here
was Superman.

207
00:25:03,747 --> 00:25:05,618
Ha.
Yes, Superman.

208
00:25:05,619 --> 00:25:08,117
Yeah, but, there are...
there are more of them.

209
00:25:08,118 --> 00:25:10,969
- The meta-human thesis.
- Yes, the meta-human thesis.

210
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:14,506
More likely than not.
These exceptional beings live among us.

211
00:25:14,507 --> 00:25:17,320
The bases of our myths.
Gods among men upon our...

212
00:25:17,321 --> 00:25:19,598
our little blue planet here.

213
00:25:21,022 --> 00:25:23,100
You don't have to use
the silver bullet,

214
00:25:23,101 --> 00:25:25,386
but, if you forge one...

215
00:25:25,469 --> 00:25:26,923
Well, then...

216
00:25:26,924 --> 00:25:30,556
We don't have to depend
upon the kindness of monsters.

217
00:25:31,687 --> 00:25:35,916
Daily ☮Planet
- SUPERMAN PREVENTS MISSILE STRIKE!
- HEROIC SUPERMAN RESCUE

218
00:25:35,917 --> 00:25:39,173
BRUCE WAYNE RESCUES EMPLOYEE

219
00:26:38,608 --> 00:26:41,208
Sir.
Get down.

220
00:26:41,687 --> 00:26:46,288
Sir, I said,
get down, now!

221
00:26:47,202 --> 00:26:49,563
Can we get some backup here?

222
00:26:49,985 --> 00:26:52,239
Hey. Hey.
Don't do it!

223
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,933
HEY!

224
00:26:55,749 --> 00:26:59,101
Lois.
Crime Lab, on 3.

225
00:26:59,745 --> 00:27:00,961
This is Lane.

226
00:27:00,962 --> 00:27:02,677
Kent, you're sports today.

227
00:27:02,678 --> 00:27:04,873
I want you to follow
up on the football.

228
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:08,896
Underdog dreams dashed
10 yards between Gotham and glory.

229
00:27:08,897 --> 00:27:10,853
Hey.
Are you guys watching this?

230
00:27:10,854 --> 00:27:14,927
Emergency responders quickly created
a precautionary perimeter around Heroes Park

231
00:27:14,928 --> 00:27:17,777
while they brought the man down
from this beloved monument.

232
00:27:17,778 --> 00:27:21,057
The suspect has been identified
as Wallace Vernon Keefe.

233
00:27:21,058 --> 00:27:23,870
I work for Bruce Wayne!
I work for Bruce Wayne!

234
00:27:23,871 --> 00:27:27,407
There'll be arraign on charges of
vandalism, resisting arrest

235
00:27:27,408 --> 00:27:30,156
<font color="#ff8080">FALSE GOD</font>
- and a felony charge of making terrorist threats

236
00:27:30,157 --> 00:27:32,223
that carries up to
40 years in prison.

237
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:34,369
Poor son of a bitch.

238
00:27:35,449 --> 00:27:36,736
- Jenny.
- Mm?

239
00:27:36,737 --> 00:27:37,815
Headline.

240
00:27:37,816 --> 00:27:42,332
"End of love affair
with man in the sky?"

241
00:27:43,074 --> 00:27:44,698
Okay.

242
00:27:49,273 --> 00:27:52,523
There're ways
we can help each other.

243
00:27:52,538 --> 00:27:53,658
Ah.

244
00:27:53,659 --> 00:27:55,954
Could you step
into my office here?

245
00:27:59,016 --> 00:28:00,384
Yes!

246
00:28:00,385 --> 00:28:02,535
What's your wish list?

247
00:28:04,643 --> 00:28:05,827
Uh.

248
00:28:05,828 --> 00:28:09,640
Access to the wreck of the
crashed Kryptonian ship.

249
00:28:10,862 --> 00:28:12,541
Done.

250
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:04,891
The complete remains
of the dead alien for testing.

251
00:29:05,549 --> 00:29:07,864
You want Zod's body?

252
00:29:08,013 --> 00:29:09,715
Okay.

253
00:29:45,621 --> 00:29:47,362
It's cherry.

254
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,217
- Show him what you got!
- Dude, let's go!

255
00:29:58,218 --> 00:30:00,489
*Make sure to hit his left.

256
00:30:03,138 --> 00:30:05,772
Come on.
Throw a punch, will you?

257
00:30:06,536 --> 00:30:09,518
Let's go!
Come on!

258
00:30:31,658 --> 00:30:33,476
Thank you.

259
00:30:41,728 --> 00:30:44,099
The house treats luck like an insult.

260
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,792
Good luck for one has always
gives others misfortune.

261
00:30:47,793 --> 00:30:51,653
But, eventually,
all accounts will be settled.

262
00:30:51,654 --> 00:30:54,991
3 nights with a Bolshoi ballerina,
the line was all she tell me.

263
00:30:54,992 --> 00:30:57,150
Not all I'm sure.

264
00:30:57,151 --> 00:30:58,973
Good evening.

265
00:31:01,335 --> 00:31:03,286
<font color="#ff8080">DEVICE CLONING
SUCCESSFUL</font>

266
00:31:03,287 --> 00:31:05,423
It's like a 1 man reign of terror.

267
00:31:05,424 --> 00:31:09,076
This bat vigilante has been
consistently targeting the port

268
00:31:09,077 --> 00:31:10,999
and the adjacent projects
and tenements.

269
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,148
And as far as I can tell
the cops are actually helping him.

270
00:31:13,149 --> 00:31:16,150
Crime wave in Gotham.

271
00:31:16,151 --> 00:31:19,526
Other breaking news.
Water, wet.

272
00:31:19,527 --> 00:31:22,806
- Did you file the football yet?
- Why aren't we covering this?

273
00:31:22,807 --> 00:31:24,868
Poor people don't buy papers?

274
00:31:24,869 --> 00:31:26,532
People don't buy papers,
period, Kent.

275
00:31:26,533 --> 00:31:30,252
Perry, when you assign a story, you're
making a choice about who matters...

276
00:31:30,253 --> 00:31:33,193
- ... and who's worth it.
- Good morning, Smallville

277
00:31:33,194 --> 00:31:37,384
The America conscious died
with Robert, Martin and John.

278
00:31:37,385 --> 00:31:39,447
Sorry.
Sorry.

279
00:31:40,034 --> 00:31:41,251
No match.

280
00:31:41,252 --> 00:31:44,233
My guys in the crime lab,
never seen one before.

281
00:31:44,805 --> 00:31:47,052
It's called a bullet.
You shoot people with it.

282
00:31:47,053 --> 00:31:49,864
Recovered from the scene
of the fire fight in the desert.

283
00:31:49,865 --> 00:31:53,391
Not sold anywhere commercially
in the world, even black market.

284
00:31:53,392 --> 00:31:54,381
So?

285
00:31:54,382 --> 00:31:58,053
So, who gave prototype military rounds
to tribe fighters in the Sahara.

286
00:31:58,054 --> 00:32:00,351
The ass, Lois.

287
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:07,258
Flight to DC tonight,
a couple of days there.

288
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:08,310
Go.

289
00:32:08,311 --> 00:32:11,158
Coach.
No extra leg room.

290
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:14,248
Economy plus.

291
00:32:14,249 --> 00:32:15,999
Coach!

292
00:32:20,881 --> 00:32:22,494
Senator.

293
00:32:23,528 --> 00:32:25,177
My dad always said that,

294
00:32:25,178 --> 00:32:28,888
Kentucky mash
was the secret to health.

295
00:32:32,432 --> 00:32:34,609
This was his room.

296
00:32:35,221 --> 00:32:37,581
I left it just the way it was.

297
00:32:37,582 --> 00:32:41,282
It's silly.
The magical thinking of orphan boys.

298
00:32:41,283 --> 00:32:44,810
I'm blocking the import license
for your mineral.

299
00:32:51,721 --> 00:32:54,585
The Red Capes are coming!

300
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:57,876
The Red Capes are coming!

301
00:33:01,486 --> 00:33:04,326
You and your hearings...

302
00:33:06,929 --> 00:33:10,818
galloping through the streets
to warn us.

303
00:33:10,819 --> 00:33:15,525
One, if by land.
Two, if by air.

304
00:33:20,668 --> 00:33:23,967
Do you know the oldest lie
in America, Senator?

305
00:33:24,108 --> 00:33:27,509
- Can I call you June?
- You can call me whatever you like.

306
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:31,519
Take a bucket of piss and
call it Granny's peach tea.

307
00:33:31,888 --> 00:33:35,731
Take a weapon of assassination
and call it deterrence.

308
00:33:37,001 --> 00:33:39,528
You won't fool a fly on me.

309
00:33:40,531 --> 00:33:42,765
I'm not going to drink it.

310
00:33:47,205 --> 00:33:49,739
Hey, you don't think
Dad would mind, do you?

311
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:52,067
If I change just...

312
00:33:52,628 --> 00:33:55,395
... just one thing in this room.

313
00:33:56,557 --> 00:34:00,174
Because, that should be upside down.

314
00:34:01,396 --> 00:34:03,385
Now, we know better now,
don't we?

315
00:34:03,386 --> 00:34:07,533
The devils don't come from
hell beneath us. No.

316
00:34:07,534 --> 00:34:10,097
No, they come from the sky.

317
00:34:45,413 --> 00:34:48,707
MARTHA WAYNE
1946 - 1981

318
00:35:55,941 --> 00:35:57,970
Wrong room, miss.

319
00:35:58,016 --> 00:36:01,626
Secretary Swanwick, you haven't been
returning my phone calls.

320
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:07,503
Miss Lane, if you like an interview,
Major Farris is just outside that door.

321
00:36:07,504 --> 00:36:10,101
You're treating me like a stranger?

322
00:36:10,929 --> 00:36:13,000
I'm treating you like a reporter.

323
00:36:13,001 --> 00:36:14,176
Alright.

324
00:36:14,177 --> 00:36:18,555
Is the US providing experimental
military arms to rebels in Africa?

325
00:36:18,556 --> 00:36:20,922
You know with balls like yours.

326
00:36:20,987 --> 00:36:22,886
You belong in here.

327
00:36:22,887 --> 00:36:26,214
Who's your source on this?
A tin foil hat?

328
00:36:26,215 --> 00:36:28,539
No, not tin,
but it's metal.

329
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:32,306
Fired in the Superman incident.
Experts at the Pentagon can't ID it.

330
00:36:32,307 --> 00:36:34,906
- We haven't been told the truth.
- Here's the truth.

331
00:36:34,907 --> 00:36:37,781
A reporter got greedy for a scoop
and went where she shouldn't have.

332
00:36:37,782 --> 00:36:42,610
Superman acted like some... rogue combatant
to rescue her and people died.

333
00:36:42,668 --> 00:36:46,255
Don't invent a conspiracy theory
to put back his halo.

334
00:36:46,724 --> 00:36:48,538
Or yours.

335
00:36:49,066 --> 00:36:51,134
- Major.
- Sir.

336
00:36:52,896 --> 00:36:54,170
Oh.

337
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:59,250
I hope the next generation of Waynes
won't inherit an empty wine cellar.

338
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:03,747
Don't think there's a likely
to be a next generation.

339
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:06,371
Thank you, sir.

340
00:37:08,604 --> 00:37:12,163
This is every call made
from the Russian's phone.

341
00:37:12,164 --> 00:37:15,083
Two mentions of business
with the "White Portuguese" and

342
00:37:15,084 --> 00:37:19,696
it's continuing transmitting black out
data to the personal residence

343
00:37:19,697 --> 00:37:21,200
of Alexandra Luthor.

344
00:37:21,201 --> 00:37:25,692
You think Lex Luthor
is the "White Portuguese"?

345
00:37:25,934 --> 00:37:28,878
I can't see that he needs
the income from imported arms.

346
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:31,009
Regardless, I'll need to
put a 'leech' in his house,

347
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:32,355
and I'm going
to need the suit.

348
00:37:32,356 --> 00:37:37,422
The Bat interrogated 6 people
and came away with nothing.

349
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:40,464
It was Bruce Wayne
that got the information.

350
00:37:40,465 --> 00:37:43,487
Well, Bruce Wayne can't
break into Lex Luthor's house.

351
00:37:43,488 --> 00:37:46,034
Bruce Wayne won't have to.

352
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:49,565
He's been invited.

353
00:38:16,368 --> 00:38:20,268
<font color="#ffff80">HA HA HA
Joke's on you
BATMAN</font>

354
00:38:43,801 --> 00:38:45,234
- That's him right there!
- There he is! Get a shot!

355
00:38:45,235 --> 00:38:47,091
- Bruce, over here!
- Bruce, Bruce.

356
00:38:47,092 --> 00:38:49,555
- Wayne, have a shot.
- Mr. Wayne!

357
00:38:49,556 --> 00:38:52,782
- Right here, one second.
- This way, Mr. Wayne!

358
00:38:54,001 --> 00:38:55,648
Who's that?

359
00:38:55,963 --> 00:38:58,399
You must be new to the
let them eat cake beat.

360
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,061
That is Bruce Wayne.

361
00:39:01,062 --> 00:39:03,637
Philanthropist.
Bibliophile.

362
00:39:03,638 --> 00:39:08,867
True friend of the library of Metropolis.
Mr. Lex Luthor.

363
00:39:14,976 --> 00:39:16,544
Nikki.

364
00:39:17,448 --> 00:39:19,343
You're embarrassing me.

365
00:39:19,729 --> 00:39:23,684
Speech. Speech.
Uh, blah blah blah.

366
00:39:24,224 --> 00:39:26,096
Open bar.

367
00:39:30,672 --> 00:39:33,562
The word Philanthropist,
comes from the Greek.

368
00:39:33,563 --> 00:39:36,271
Meaning a lover of humanity

369
00:39:36,373 --> 00:39:38,841
It was coined about,
2,500 years ago...

370
00:39:38,842 --> 00:39:40,398
Alright, where am I going, Alfred?

371
00:39:40,399 --> 00:39:44,624
Approach the elevator,
to your left.

372
00:39:44,625 --> 00:39:46,684
That where it must be.

373
00:39:46,685 --> 00:39:48,812
It's in the service
corridor in the basement.

374
00:39:48,813 --> 00:39:50,980
Go down the stairs.

375
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:52,998
Prometheus went with us,

376
00:39:52,999 --> 00:39:55,771
and he ruined Zeus' plan
to destroy man kind

377
00:39:55,772 --> 00:39:58,695
and for that, he was given a thunderbolt.
Chooo!

378
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:01,143
Hm.
That seems unfair.

379
00:40:01,689 --> 00:40:03,722
On the serious note,
the library of Metropolis...

380
00:40:03,723 --> 00:40:06,885
Down the stairs.
It's the only way in, down the stairs.

381
00:40:06,886 --> 00:40:08,716
But, at one time,
Dad could not either.

382
00:40:08,717 --> 00:40:10,609
No, my father could not
afford the books, so...

383
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:14,088
He had to root through the garbage
for yesterday's newspaper.

384
00:40:15,514 --> 00:40:18,191
Now you got the kitchens
on your right.

385
00:40:18,391 --> 00:40:19,881
To the left.

386
00:40:19,882 --> 00:40:22,648
Right in front of you,
that's where you want to be.

387
00:40:38,109 --> 00:40:40,380
May I help you, Mr. Wayne?

388
00:40:40,381 --> 00:40:44,119
Uh, I just...
thought the bathroom was down here.

389
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,369
I must have...

390
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:49,148
That last Martini was a...
too too many, I think.

391
00:40:49,149 --> 00:40:52,902
- Men's room is upstairs.
- Great, I'm okay.

392
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,187
I like those shoes.

393
00:40:58,881 --> 00:41:01,094
I can't stay down here, Alfred.

394
00:41:01,095 --> 00:41:02,761
Go upstairs and socialize.

395
00:41:02,762 --> 00:41:06,275
Some young lady from Metropolis
will make you honest.

396
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:09,693
In your dreams, Alfred.

397
00:41:09,694 --> 00:41:13,094
Books are knowledge,
and knowledge is puff worth.

398
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:15,274
And I am...
Heh heh heh, no.

399
00:41:15,275 --> 00:41:16,415
I, umm.

400
00:41:16,416 --> 00:41:18,710
No, what am I?
Alright, what am I suppose to say?

401
00:41:18,711 --> 00:41:20,150
No.

402
00:41:21,405 --> 00:41:25,136
The bitter sweet pain among man
is having knowledge with no power.

403
00:41:25,137 --> 00:41:26,848
Because...

404
00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:30,141
Because that is paradoxical,
and umm...

405
00:41:32,235 --> 00:41:34,152
Thank you for coming.

406
00:41:35,573 --> 00:41:38,084
Please, drink, it's free.

407
00:41:46,096 --> 00:41:49,013
Mr. Wayne.
Mr. Wayne.

408
00:41:49,114 --> 00:41:50,477
Clark Kent, Daily Planet.

409
00:41:50,478 --> 00:41:54,474
Oh, my foundation has already issued
a statement in support of the... cause.

410
00:41:54,475 --> 00:41:56,209
I'm sorry?

411
00:41:56,738 --> 00:42:00,076
Wow. Pretty girl. Bad habit.
Don't quote me, alright?

412
00:42:00,077 --> 00:42:03,510
What's your position on the
bat vigilante in Gotham?

413
00:42:03,882 --> 00:42:05,057
Daily Planet.

414
00:42:05,058 --> 00:42:07,350
Wait, do I own this one?
Or was that the other guy?

415
00:42:07,351 --> 00:42:10,359
Civil liberties has been
trampled on in your city.

416
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,798
Good people living in fear.

417
00:42:13,309 --> 00:42:15,358
Don't believe everything you hear, son.

418
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,538
I've seen it, Mr. Wayne.

419
00:42:17,539 --> 00:42:19,794
He thinks he's above the law.

420
00:42:21,593 --> 00:42:25,927
The Daily Planet criticizing those
who think they're above the laws.

421
00:42:25,928 --> 00:42:29,096
A little hypocritical, wouldn't you say?

422
00:42:29,097 --> 00:42:31,728
Considering every time your hero
saves a cat out of a tree,

423
00:42:31,729 --> 00:42:36,272
you write a puff piece editorial,
about an alien who...

424
00:42:36,273 --> 00:42:39,473
if he wanted to,
could burn the whole place down.

425
00:42:39,549 --> 00:42:42,752
There wouldn't be a damn thing
we can do to stop him.

426
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:47,850
Most of the world doesn't share
your opinion, Mr. Wayne.

427
00:42:47,851 --> 00:42:50,971
Maybe it's the...
Gotham City and me, we just...

428
00:42:50,972 --> 00:42:55,099
... have a bad history with
freaks dressed like clowns.

429
00:42:56,061 --> 00:42:59,767
Boys!
Mm, Bruce Wayne meets Clark Kent.

430
00:42:59,768 --> 00:43:02,469
Ah, I love it!
I love bringing people together!

431
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:03,814
- How are we?
- Lex.

432
00:43:03,815 --> 00:43:06,124
Hello, good.
Hi, hello.

433
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:08,759
Lex. It is a pleasure... Ow!
Wow, that is a good grip!

434
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,964
You should,
not pick a fight with this person.

435
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:14,642
So, after all these years,
we've finally got you over to Metropolis.

436
00:43:14,643 --> 00:43:17,103
- Well, I thought I come drink you dry.
- Well, you're welcome.

437
00:43:17,104 --> 00:43:19,538
You should hop the hub more often though,
I love to show you my labs.

438
00:43:19,539 --> 00:43:22,226
Maybe we could,
be partner on something.

439
00:43:22,227 --> 00:43:25,659
My R&D is up to
all sorts of no good.

440
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:30,768
<font color="#80ffff">TRANSFER COMPLETE</font>
- That's 7 minutes.

441
00:43:30,769 --> 00:43:33,094
Look likes the transfer's complete.

442
00:43:33,095 --> 00:43:34,368
- Mr. Luthor.
- Yes.

443
00:43:34,369 --> 00:43:36,282
- The governor.
- Governor.

444
00:43:36,283 --> 00:43:37,620
- Excuse me.
- Next time.

445
00:43:37,621 --> 00:43:41,772
- Governor, hi.
- Lex, it's good to see you.

446
00:43:53,825 --> 00:43:59,361
"... a deadly factory fire has interrupted
the Day of the Dead celebration in Juarez."

447
00:44:19,415 --> 00:44:21,048
Excuse me.

448
00:44:33,711 --> 00:44:37,621
"I can't believe they're
going to let that poor girl die."

449
00:45:26,148 --> 00:45:30,037
We, as a population on this planet,
have been looking for a savior.

450
00:45:30,038 --> 00:45:32,677
90% of people believe
in a higher power.

451
00:45:32,678 --> 00:45:35,967
And every religion believes
in some sort messianic figure.

452
00:45:35,968 --> 00:45:39,171
And when this savior character
actually comes to Earth,

453
00:45:39,172 --> 00:45:41,416
we want to make him abide
by our rules?

454
00:45:41,417 --> 00:45:43,604
We have to understand that
this is a paradigm shift.

455
00:45:43,605 --> 00:45:46,070
We have to start thinking
beyond politics.

456
00:45:46,071 --> 00:45:48,731
Are there any
moral constraints on this person?

457
00:45:48,732 --> 00:45:50,768
We have international law.

458
00:45:50,769 --> 00:45:54,114
On this Earth,
every act is a political act.

459
00:45:54,115 --> 00:45:58,259
Is it really surprising,
that the most powerful man in the world

460
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:01,383
should be a figure of controversy?

461
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:06,305
To have an individual engaging
in the state level interventions

462
00:46:06,306 --> 00:46:08,426
should give us all pause.

463
00:46:08,427 --> 00:46:12,855
Human beings have a horrible track record
of following people with great power,

464
00:46:12,856 --> 00:46:16,338
down paths that lead to
huge human monstrosities.

465
00:46:16,339 --> 00:46:19,174
We have always created icons
in our own image.

466
00:46:19,175 --> 00:46:22,614
What we've done is we project
ourselves on to him.

467
00:46:22,615 --> 00:46:26,442
The fact is, maybe he's not
some sort of devil or Jesus character.

468
00:46:26,443 --> 00:46:28,771
Maybe he’s just a guy
trying to do the right thing.

469
00:46:28,772 --> 00:46:32,114
We’re talking about a being
whose very existence

470
00:46:32,115 --> 00:46:36,576
challenges our own sense of
priority in the universe.

471
00:46:36,577 --> 00:46:39,069
If you go back to Copernicus,
where he restored

472
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:42,501
the sun and the center of the
known universe, displacing Earth.

473
00:46:42,502 --> 00:46:44,469
And you get to Darwinian evolution

474
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:46,516
and you find out,
we're not special on this Earth

475
00:46:46,517 --> 00:46:49,245
we're just one among
other life forms.

476
00:46:49,246 --> 00:46:52,825
And now we learned, that we're not
even special in the entire universe

477
00:46:52,826 --> 00:46:55,552
because there is Superman.

478
00:46:55,553 --> 00:46:59,262
There he is, an alien,
among us.

479
00:46:59,263 --> 00:47:01,307
We're not alone.

480
00:47:01,308 --> 00:47:04,809
Are you, as a United State Senator,
personally comfortable

481
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:11,646
saying to a grieving parent,
"Superman could've saved your child,

482
00:47:11,647 --> 00:47:15,761
but on principle
we did not want him to act."

483
00:47:15,762 --> 00:47:17,627
I'm not saying he shouldn't act.

484
00:47:17,628 --> 00:47:19,680
I'm saying he shouldn't act unilaterally.

485
00:47:19,681 --> 00:47:21,773
What are we talking about here then?

486
00:47:21,774 --> 00:47:25,577
Must there be a Superman?

487
00:47:26,735 --> 00:47:28,388
There is.

488
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:38,327
Keefe, you made bail.
Open Two.

489
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,982
Who paid?

490
00:47:56,233 --> 00:47:58,320
Who the hell are you?

491
00:48:03,472 --> 00:48:05,563
- Just a man.
- Yeah?

492
00:48:05,564 --> 00:48:07,581
Well, what do you want?

493
00:48:11,834 --> 00:48:14,509
To help you stand for something.

494
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:20,788
Your 3 o'clock's here.

495
00:48:30,005 --> 00:48:33,596
He made me half a man.

496
00:48:34,173 --> 00:48:36,267
Let me face him.

497
00:48:36,268 --> 00:48:40,081
So, I logged into your drop box
to find a copy.

498
00:48:40,082 --> 00:48:42,231
There's a copy, alright.

499
00:48:42,305 --> 00:48:46,315
But, nothing about football.
Nothing about...

500
00:48:46,316 --> 00:48:49,724
Friends of the Metropolis Library,
just...

501
00:48:49,725 --> 00:48:54,483
The god damn Gotham bat thing,
I told you not to pursue.

502
00:48:54,484 --> 00:48:56,817
The police won't help,
the press has to do the right thing.

503
00:48:56,818 --> 00:48:58,546
You don't get to decide
what the right thing is.

504
00:48:58,547 --> 00:49:00,911
When the Planet was founded,
it stood for something, Perry.

505
00:49:00,912 --> 00:49:04,825
So could you, if it was 1938,
but it's not 1938.

506
00:49:04,826 --> 00:49:08,181
WPA aren't hiring no more.
Apples don't cost a nickel.

507
00:49:08,182 --> 00:49:12,014
Not in here. Not out there.
You drop this thing.

508
00:49:13,445 --> 00:49:17,335
Nobody cares about Clark Kent
taking on the Batman.

509
00:49:18,409 --> 00:49:20,836
It's the sword of Alexander.

510
00:49:20,837 --> 00:49:24,365
It's the blade that
cut the Gordian Knot.

511
00:49:26,162 --> 00:49:28,639
- It's a triumph.
- Yes.

512
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,241
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

513
00:49:38,073 --> 00:49:39,815
It's a fake.

514
00:49:39,816 --> 00:49:42,857
The real was sold in '98
on the black market.

515
00:49:42,858 --> 00:49:46,685
- Now it hangs...
- Over the bed of the Sultan of Hajar.

516
00:49:49,288 --> 00:49:51,266
Excuse me.

517
00:49:52,019 --> 00:49:53,996
Excuse me, Miss.

518
00:49:53,997 --> 00:49:57,328
The other night, you took something
that doesn't belong to you.

519
00:49:57,329 --> 00:49:59,451
Stealing's not polite.

520
00:49:59,452 --> 00:50:03,020
Is it stealing if you steal
from another thief?

521
00:50:03,861 --> 00:50:05,552
Who are you?

522
00:50:05,553 --> 00:50:08,893
Someone interested in
the same man you are.

523
00:50:09,417 --> 00:50:10,762
Is that right?

524
00:50:10,763 --> 00:50:14,183
I believe Mr. Luthor has
a photo that belongs to me.

525
00:50:14,184 --> 00:50:15,708
Did you get it?

526
00:50:15,709 --> 00:50:18,206
As it happens, no, I didn't.

527
00:50:18,207 --> 00:50:21,856
The data you copied
is military grade encryption.

528
00:50:22,541 --> 00:50:24,680
You know.
I bet with that dress

529
00:50:24,681 --> 00:50:27,661
9 out of 10 men would let you
get away with anything.

530
00:50:27,662 --> 00:50:29,255
But, you're the 10th.

531
00:50:29,256 --> 00:50:31,521
Mmm.
I guess I am the first,

532
00:50:31,522 --> 00:50:34,753
to see through that babe
in the woods act.

533
00:50:35,095 --> 00:50:36,812
You don't know me,

534
00:50:36,813 --> 00:50:39,596
but, I've known
a few women like you.

535
00:50:41,772 --> 00:50:45,181
Oh, I don't think you've ever
known a woman like me.

536
00:50:46,421 --> 00:50:49,502
You know, it's true what
they say about little boys:

born with no natural
inclination to share.

538
00:50:53,512 --> 00:50:57,625
I didn't steal your drive.
I borrowed it.

He has the power to wipe out
the entire human race

599
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:06,377
and If we believe there even a
1% chance that he is our enemy,

And this...

680
01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:29,347
This is what war looks like.
I have nothing.

681
01:08:29,348 --> 01:08:32,386

I'm just here to tell my story.

690
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:52,719
That I was willing to finance
a Kryptonian deterrent,

691
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:56,039
but a certain junior Senator from Kentucky
decided to block it.

692
01:08:56,040 --> 01:09:00,425
Yes, the Chair of the Committee
on Superman is soft on security.

01:09:00,426 --> 01:09:02,306
Greg, why hasn't he
been getting our checks?

694
01:09:02,307 --> 01:09:03,319
He is, Mr. Wayne.

695
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:05,740
He gets a check from the
victims fund every month.

696
01:09:05,741 --> 01:09:07,559
<font color="#ffc58a">BRUCE WAYNE, OPEN YOUR EYES</font>
- He returns them.

697
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:10,217
An employee of Wayne financial
who lost both his legs

698
01:09:10,218 --> 01:09:13,363
 in those horrific events in Metropolis
that happened 2 years ago.

699
01:09:13,364 --> 01:09:14,799
<font color="#ebcd96">Bruce, NO TRUCE</font>
- Jesus.

700
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:17,399
<font color="#ebcd96">- B WAYNE, I HAUNT YOU
- BRUCE WAYNE = BLIND</font>

701
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:18,719
Why haven't I seen this?

702
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:20,919
I'm sorry.
I'll get to the bottom of it.

703
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:23,759
And there he is.
Superman is here.

704
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:26,005
He's actually at the
United States capitol.

705
01:09:26,006 --> 01:09:28,264
This is really a historic moment.

706
01:09:28,265 --> 01:09:32,559
Nor we expect that Superman would give
some kind of a statement to the Senate

707
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:36,079
to the American people,
and of course to the world.

708
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:37,719
He's here.
He came.

709
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:40,159
- He's above the Capitol.
- Ow.

710
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:42,919
You are going to be on the
hot seat in there, June bun.

711
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:44,479
I grew up on a farm.

712
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,512
I know how to wrestle a pig.

713
01:09:46,513 --> 01:09:49,294
Do you know the oldest lie
in America, Senator?

714
01:09:50,225 --> 01:09:52,924
It's that power can be innocent.

715
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:56,190
Good luck.

716
01:10:01,979 --> 01:10:04,678
Freddy, good to go.

717
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:08,578
- SUPERMAN=ILLEGAL ALIEN
- THIS IS OUR WORLD, NOT YOURS!

718
01:10:08,579 --> 01:10:11,070
- EARTH BELONGS TO HUMANS
- GOD HATES ALIENS

719
01:10:12,294 --> 01:10:14,502
GET OUT!

720
01:10:17,038 --> 01:10:20,244
GET OUT!
GET OUT!

721
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:29,326
Another one came this morning
Mr. Wayne.

722
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:10,552
Let me say at the outset that
I am grateful to our witness

723
01:11:10,553 --> 01:11:13,313
for coming before us today.

724
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:16,372
This is how a democracy works.

725
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:19,119
We talk to each other.

726
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:24,182
We act by the consent
of the govern, sir,

727
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:26,435
I have sat here before

728
01:11:26,436 --> 01:11:30,999
 to say that shadow interventions
will not tolerate by this Committee.

729
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,719
Neither will lies.

730
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:38,704
Because today is a day for truth.

731
01:11:39,517 --> 01:11:42,261
Because only by speaking...

732
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:56,471
Only by working...
together, can we...

733
01:12:01,856 --> 01:12:03,743
can we...
can we...

734
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:17,799
can we create a free and a...

735
01:12:20,177 --> 01:12:23,253
GRANNY'S PEACH TEA

736
01:12:29,151 --> 01:12:31,826
Mr. Lex Luthor
CEO - Lexcorp

737
01:12:45,422 --> 01:12:47,222
Oh, my God!

738
01:13:20,281 --> 01:13:25,017
WAYNE TOWER DEVASTATED
<font color="#ff8080">YOU LET YOUR FAMILY DIE</font>

739
01:13:35,514 --> 01:13:38,314
LEXCORP

740
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:26,986
Capitol Police are confirming to CNN
that the suspected bomber is

741
01:14:26,987 --> 01:14:29,359
Wallace Vernon Keefe
Now these sources also say...

742
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:31,319
Clarke, it's me again.
Can you...

743
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:33,536
gotten explosive device
into the hearing

744
01:14:33,537 --> 01:14:36,060
by concealing them
inside his wheelchair.

745
01:14:36,061 --> 01:14:39,519
As for Superman, he was in the room,
but obviously failed to stop him.

746
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:41,839
I didn't see it, Lo.

747
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,999
Standing right there
and I didn't see it.

748
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,639
Clark, there are people behind this.

749
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:48,740
I'm afraid I didn't see it
because I wasn't looking.

750
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:53,155
All this time.

751
01:14:53,314 --> 01:14:56,634
I've been living my life
the way my father saw it.

752
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:59,572
Mending wrongs for a ghost.

753
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:04,040
Thinking I'm here to do good.

754
01:15:07,531 --> 01:15:10,239
Superman was never real.

755
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:13,596
It's just a dream of
a farmer from Kansas.

756
01:15:14,351 --> 01:15:17,839
That farmer's dream is
all some people have.

757
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:20,454
It's all that gives them hope.

758
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:33,554
This means something.

759
01:15:34,126 --> 01:15:36,686
It did on my world.

760
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:39,760
My world doesn't exist anymore.

761
01:16:54,903 --> 01:16:58,239

"His disappearance raises questions."

804
01:21:19,675 --> 01:21:20,594
No.

805
01:21:20,595 --> 01:21:23,748
"How could he simply have disappeared
at a time when we, as a nation,

806
01:21:23,749 --> 01:21:25,704
need him more than ever?"

807
01:21:25,705 --> 01:21:27,479
WAS SUPERMAN INVOLVED?

808
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:32,864
Burn him!
Burn him!

809
01:22:14,074 --> 01:22:16,207
Something, isn't it?

810
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:21,547
We met Kansas, live on a pancake
so we come to the mountains.

811
01:22:22,386 --> 01:22:24,597
All downhill from here.

812
01:22:24,598 --> 01:22:26,589
Down to the flood plain.

813
01:22:26,590 --> 01:22:29,103
The farm is at the
bottom of the world.

814
01:22:30,024 --> 01:22:33,167
I remember one season
water came bad.

815
01:22:33,168 --> 01:22:35,199
I couldn't been 12.

816
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:38,188
Dad had out the shovels
and we went at it all night.

817
01:22:38,189 --> 01:22:40,253
We worked until
I think I fainted.

818
01:22:40,254 --> 01:22:42,933
But we managed to
stop the water.

819
01:22:43,298 --> 01:22:45,770
We saved the farm.

820
01:22:46,235 --> 01:22:50,535
Your grandma baked me a cake.
She said I was a hero.

821
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:54,796
Later that day we found out.

822
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:58,178
We blocked the water, alright,
we sent it upstream.

823
01:22:58,688 --> 01:23:01,491
All alike farm washed away.

824
01:23:02,168 --> 01:23:05,900
While eating my hero cake,
their horses were drowning.

825
01:23:08,041 --> 01:23:10,972
I used to hear them
wailing in my sleep.

826
01:23:14,096 --> 01:23:16,554
Did the nightmares ever stop?

827
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,401
Yeah.

828
01:23:20,737 --> 01:23:23,165
When I met your mother.

829
01:23:24,641 --> 01:23:28,032
She gave me faith that
there is good in this world.

830
01:23:29,913 --> 01:23:32,330
She was my world.

831
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:37,297
I miss you, son.

832
01:23:41,417 --> 01:23:43,928
I miss you too, Dad.

833
01:24:03,217 --> 01:24:05,820
You know you can't win.

834
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:08,960
It's suicide.

835
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:14,574
I'm older now than
my father ever was.

836
01:24:16,321 --> 01:24:20,024
This maybe the only thing
I do that matters.

837
01:24:20,025 --> 01:24:24,039
20 years of fighting criminals
amount to nothing?

838
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:26,668
Criminals are like weeds, Alfred.

839
01:24:26,669 --> 01:24:29,877
Pull 1 up, another
grows in it's place.

840
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:34,080
This is about the future
of the world.

841
01:24:35,031 --> 01:24:36,999
It's my legacy.

842
01:24:37,918 --> 01:24:40,348
You know, my father sat
me down, right here.

843
01:24:40,349 --> 01:24:42,575
Told me what Wayne manor
was built of.

844
01:24:42,576 --> 01:24:46,055
Railways, real estates
and oil.

845
01:24:46,056 --> 01:24:49,761
The first generation made their
fortune trading with the French.

846
01:24:49,762 --> 01:24:52,201
Pelts and skins.

847
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:57,357
They were hunters.

848
01:25:10,978 --> 01:25:14,765
We got to wait for more evidence,
but the question still remains,

849
01:25:14,766 --> 01:25:16,622
where is he?

850
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:19,039
If Superman was not involved,

851
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:20,543
If he's got nothing to hide,

852
01:25:20,544 --> 01:25:24,098
then why hasn't he been seen
since the day of this tragedy?

853
01:25:24,099 --> 01:25:25,780
Look, you can't...

854
01:26:42,370 --> 01:26:44,742
The knight is here.

855
01:27:15,069 --> 01:27:16,915
Excuse me.

856
01:27:18,376 --> 01:27:20,407
Don't I know you...

857
01:28:04,940 --> 01:28:09,603
Plain lo, in the morning
Lola in slacks.

858
01:28:10,042 --> 01:28:11,962
Lois Lane.

859
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:15,480
Mmm.
Come see the view.

860
01:28:17,820 --> 01:28:20,188
Now, the secret is the height.

861
01:28:20,189 --> 01:28:22,339
It's the building material.

862
01:28:22,340 --> 01:28:26,620
it's light metals, which...
sway a bit in the wind.

863
01:28:30,460 --> 01:28:33,859
And you know something about LEXCORP metals,
don't you, Miss Lane?

864
01:28:33,860 --> 01:28:35,631
I've proven what you've done.

865
01:28:35,632 --> 01:28:37,779
Wow, you're feisty.

866
01:28:37,780 --> 01:28:40,499
Unfortunately, that will blow away.

867
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:42,219
Like sand in the desert.

868
01:28:42,220 --> 01:28:43,555
You're psychotic.

869
01:28:43,556 --> 01:28:47,824
That is a three syllable word for
any thought too big for little minds.

870
01:28:47,825 --> 01:28:50,219
Next category: Circles.

871
01:28:50,220 --> 01:28:55,019
Round and round and round
they go to find Superman.

872
01:28:55,020 --> 01:28:57,299
Wrong category, boy.
No, not triangles.

873
01:28:57,300 --> 01:28:58,819
Yes, Euclidean triangle inequality

874
01:28:58,820 --> 01:29:02,723
The shortest distance between
any 2 points is a straight path.

875
01:29:02,724 --> 01:29:05,711
And I believe the swiftest path
to Superman...

876
01:29:05,712 --> 01:29:10,481
.. is a pretty little road.
Mmm, called Lois Lane.

877
01:29:11,471 --> 01:29:14,527
Aahhhhhh!!

878
01:29:32,271 --> 01:29:34,283
You came back.

879
01:29:34,386 --> 01:29:36,393
You came back.

880
01:29:55,052 --> 01:29:58,137
Boy, do we have problems up here!

881
01:30:01,380 --> 01:30:04,386
The problem of,
of evil in the world.

882
01:30:04,387 --> 01:30:06,459
The problem of absolute virtue.

883
01:30:06,460 --> 01:30:10,169
I'll take you in without breaking you.
Which is more than you deserve.

884
01:30:10,170 --> 01:30:12,891
The problem of you
on top of everything else.

885
01:30:12,892 --> 01:30:14,757
You above all.

886
01:30:14,758 --> 01:30:16,970
Ah.
'Cause that's what God is.

887
01:30:17,060 --> 01:30:21,725
Horus. Apollo.
Jehovah. Kal-El.

888
01:30:22,429 --> 01:30:26,469
Clark Joseph Kent.

889
01:30:27,125 --> 01:30:31,259
See. What we call God depends
upon our tribe, Clark Jo.

890
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:34,459
Because God is tribal.
God takes sides.

891
01:30:34,460 --> 01:30:36,419
No man in the sky intervened
when I was a boy

892
01:30:36,420 --> 01:30:39,499
to deliver me from Daddy's fist
and abominations. Mm mm.

893
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:41,525
I've figured it out way back,

894
01:30:41,526 --> 01:30:45,699
if God is all powerful,
he cannot be all good.

895
01:30:46,460 --> 01:30:50,219
And if he's all good
then he cannot be all powerful.

896
01:30:50,220 --> 01:30:52,567
And neither can you be.

897
01:30:52,568 --> 01:30:55,794
They need to see
the fraud you are.

898
01:30:55,801 --> 01:30:58,131
With their eyes.

899
01:30:58,300 --> 01:31:01,219
The blood on your hands.

900
01:31:01,220 --> 01:31:02,844
What have you done?

901
01:31:02,845 --> 01:31:04,494
And tonight they will.

902
01:31:04,495 --> 01:31:08,459
Yes. Because you, my friend,
have a date!

903
01:31:08,460 --> 01:31:10,019
Across the bay.

904
01:31:10,020 --> 01:31:12,435
Ripe fruit, his hate.
2 years growing.

905
01:31:12,436 --> 01:31:14,579
But it did not take much
to push him over actually.

906
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:18,566
Little red notes, big bang.
You let your family die!

907
01:31:18,780 --> 01:31:22,542
And now, you will fly to him,

908
01:31:22,543 --> 01:31:24,859
and you will battle him,

909
01:31:24,860 --> 01:31:27,088
to the death.

910
01:31:27,335 --> 01:31:30,859
Black and Blue.
Fight night!

911
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:34,305
The greatest gladiator match
in the history of the world.

912
01:31:34,306 --> 01:31:36,667
God vs man.

913
01:31:36,668 --> 01:31:39,499
Day vs night.

914
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:43,099
Son of Krypton vs
Bat of Gotham.

915
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:45,459
You think I'll fight him for you?

916
01:31:45,460 --> 01:31:46,545
Yes, I do.

917
01:31:46,546 --> 01:31:49,739
I think you'll fight, fight, fight
for that special lady in your life.

918
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:52,339
She's safe on the ground.
How about you?

919
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:55,572
Close, but I'm not
talking about Lois.

920
01:31:55,573 --> 01:32:00,551
No. Every boy's special lady
is his mother.

921
01:32:02,214 --> 01:32:03,752
Huh!

922
01:32:05,676 --> 01:32:08,559
Martha, Martha, Martha.

923
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:13,935
The mother of a flying demon
must be a witch.

924
01:32:14,037 --> 01:32:16,899
The punishment for witches, what is that?

925
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:19,821
That's right.
Death by fire.

926
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:30,819
Where is she?

927
01:32:30,820 --> 01:32:33,579
I don't know!
I wouldn't let them tell me!

928
01:32:33,580 --> 01:32:35,099
If you kill me, Martha dies.

929
01:32:35,100 --> 01:32:40,179
And if you fly away, Martha also dies.
but if you kill the Bat...

930
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:42,113
Martha lives.

931
01:32:46,510 --> 01:32:50,328
There we go.
There we go.

932
01:32:52,447 --> 01:32:56,751
And now God,
bends to my will.

933
01:33:02,716 --> 01:33:04,819
Now the cameras are waiting
at your ship.

934
01:33:04,820 --> 01:33:07,099
For the world to see
the holes in the holy.

935
01:33:07,100 --> 01:33:10,074
Yes, the all mighty comes clean about
how dirty he is when it counts.

936
01:33:10,075 --> 01:33:14,100
To save Martha,
bring me the head of the Bat.

937
01:33:17,980 --> 01:33:20,939
Mother of God,
would you look at the time.

938
01:33:20,940 --> 01:33:24,020
When you came here,
you had an hour.

939
01:33:24,580 --> 01:33:26,833
Now it's less.

940
01:34:03,198 --> 01:34:05,079
CNN's Brooke Baldwin is on the scene.

941
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:07,259
Brooke, you're live on the air.
What do you see?

942
01:34:07,260 --> 01:34:10,010
There's something happening at the ship.

943
01:34:10,124 --> 01:34:13,604
It's sending massive power surges.

944
01:34:14,220 --> 01:34:17,539
The police created a barricade
around this containment center.

945
01:34:17,540 --> 01:34:20,508
And we're trying to get a little bit closer
here to find out what's going on.

946
01:34:20,509 --> 01:34:22,868
It is absolute chaos.
You can see that lightning.

947
01:34:22,869 --> 01:34:24,703
Those surges are like increasing and

948
01:34:24,704 --> 01:34:27,948
they seem to be getting
stronger by the minute.

949
01:34:27,949 --> 01:34:29,869
Daily Planet.

950
01:34:30,398 --> 01:34:32,233
Lois.

951
01:34:32,927 --> 01:34:35,427
I have to go to Gotham
to convince him to help me.

952
01:34:35,428 --> 01:34:37,028
Who?

953
01:34:38,260 --> 01:34:40,604
Or he has to die.

954
01:34:40,700 --> 01:34:42,423
Clark.

955
01:34:44,868 --> 01:34:47,612
No one stays good in this world.

956
01:34:57,875 --> 01:34:59,859
Metropolis in the dark /
power surges from ship

957
01:34:59,860 --> 01:35:02,979
Wayne, Bruce

Cracked Luthor's Drive found your photography.
But it doesn't belong to you.

959
01:35:15,697 --> 01:35:18,911
...it IS you.

960
01:35:29,477 --> 01:35:31,530
Who are you?

961
01:35:31,531 --> 01:35:33,733

Aww! Aww!
AAWWWWW !!!

978
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:36,079
I need a chopper to Gotham.
Call the heliport.

979
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:38,223
Chopper?
We can barely afford a bicycle.

980
01:37:38,224 --> 01:37:39,419
You want to chase a story?

981
01:37:39,420 --> 01:37:41,879
Go to the ship.
Superman's probably there already.

982
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:45,316
Perry, it's not for a story.

983
01:37:49,448 --> 01:37:51,222
Jenny, get her a
chopper to Gotham.

984
01:37:51,223 --> 01:37:53,891
And forget the heliport,
put her on the god damn roof.

985
01:37:53,892 --> 01:37:56,039
On the roof, Lois!

986
01:37:57,960 --> 01:37:59,701
Where're we headed?

987
01:37:59,702 --> 01:38:01,502
There!

988
01:38:17,017 --> 01:38:20,959
Well.
Here I am.

989
01:38:21,258 --> 01:38:23,915
Bruce.
Please

990
01:38:24,283 --> 01:38:27,439
I was wrong.
You have to listen to me.

991
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:29,520
Lex wants us...

992
01:38:43,826 --> 01:38:46,468
You don't understand.

993
01:38:46,469 --> 01:38:48,607
There's no time!

994
01:38:49,235 --> 01:38:51,420
I understand.

995
01:39:49,430 --> 01:39:51,233
Stay down!

996
01:39:51,234 --> 01:39:54,590
If I wanted it,
you'd be dead already!

997
01:40:31,606 --> 01:40:33,606
Breathe in.

998
01:40:35,749 --> 01:40:38,260
That's fear.

999
01:40:40,356 --> 01:40:42,476
You're not brave.

1000
01:40:46,108 --> 01:40:48,499
Men are brave.

1001
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:36,829
I bet your parents taught you,
that you mean something.

1002
01:44:36,909 --> 01:44:39,665
That you're here for a reason.

1003
01:44:40,296 --> 01:44:43,382
My parents taught me
a different lesson.

1004
01:44:44,455 --> 01:44:46,308
Dieing in the gutter.

1005
01:44:46,309 --> 01:44:48,958
For no reason at all.

1006
01:45:05,131 --> 01:45:10,326
They taught me the world only
makes sense, if you force it to.

1007
01:45:47,580 --> 01:45:50,340
You were never a god.

1008
01:45:52,804 --> 01:45:55,836
You were never even a man.

1009
01:46:02,020 --> 01:46:06,787
You're letting him...
kill Martha.

1010
01:46:11,084 --> 01:46:13,061
What does that mean?

1011
01:46:13,991 --> 01:46:16,255
Why did you say that name?

1012
01:46:16,744 --> 01:46:20,142
Find him!

1013
01:46:20,592 --> 01:46:22,366
Save...

1014
01:46:22,367 --> 01:46:24,669
Martha.

1015
01:46:26,998 --> 01:46:29,216
Martha.

Martha.

1018
01:47:05,200 --> 01:47:07,763
WHY DID YOU SAY THAT NAME?

1019
01:47:08,280 --> 01:47:10,159
Martha!
Why did you say that name?

1020
01:47:10,160 --> 01:47:11,519
Clark!
Stop!

1021
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:12,759
Please!
Stop!

1022
01:47:12,760 --> 01:47:14,439
WHY DID YOU SAY THAT NAME?

1023
01:47:14,440 --> 01:47:16,655
It's his mother's name.

1024
01:47:16,958 --> 01:47:19,267
It's his mother's name.

1025
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:53,887
We're no getting any answers.
We're still right outside the containment center.

1026
01:47:53,888 --> 01:47:55,170
A dangerous situation.

1027
01:47:55,171 --> 01:47:58,761
Military and police personnel
surrounding the area.

1028
01:48:13,529 --> 01:48:14,894
Luthor.

1029
01:48:14,895 --> 01:48:18,175
He wanted your life for her's.

1030
01:48:18,468 --> 01:48:20,319
She's losing time.

1031
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:23,239
The scout ship seems to be
drawing power from the city.

1032
01:48:23,240 --> 01:48:24,759
It's got to be Lex.

1033
01:48:24,760 --> 01:48:27,799
They need you at that ship.
I'll find her.

1034
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:30,664
- My mother needs me.
- Wait!

1035
01:48:30,779 --> 01:48:33,236
I'll make you a promise.

1036
01:48:33,237 --> 01:48:35,786
Your mother won't die tonight.

1037
01:49:01,940 --> 01:49:04,539
- Master Wayne.
- Alfred.

1038
01:49:04,540 --> 01:49:06,267
Uh, I'm sorry for listening in.

1039
01:49:06,268 --> 01:49:09,538
But I've tracked the Russian's phone
to a warehouse near the port.

1040
01:49:09,539 --> 01:49:11,856
You're locked on to it.

1041
01:49:27,836 --> 01:49:30,707
I'm afraid, this is goodbye.

1042
01:49:32,260 --> 01:49:37,428
I heard everytime we say goodbye,
you die a little.

1043
01:49:50,380 --> 01:49:52,120
Go!
Go!

1044
01:50:15,105 --> 01:50:16,840
You got to take it, Alfred.

1045
01:50:16,841 --> 01:50:18,799
Ah.
Right.

1046
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:21,352
Commencing drone mode.

1047
01:50:23,900 --> 01:50:28,163
Thermal imaging is showing me
two dozen hostile's on the third floor.

1048
01:50:28,164 --> 01:50:31,455
Why don't I drop you off
on the second?

1049
01:53:22,973 --> 01:53:24,760
Drop it.

1050
01:53:25,441 --> 01:53:27,673
I said, drop it!

1051
01:53:28,329 --> 01:53:30,475
I'll kill her.

1052
01:53:31,433 --> 01:53:33,863
Believe me, I'll do it!

1053
01:53:36,678 --> 01:53:38,594
I believe you.

1054
01:53:49,720 --> 01:53:52,929
It's okay.
I'm a friend of your son.

1055
01:53:52,930 --> 01:53:56,612
I figured.
The cape.

1056
01:54:23,940 --> 01:54:25,538
"Late, late", says the White Rabbit.

1057
01:54:25,539 --> 01:54:27,339
<font color="#e2a5e1">30 seconds to animation.</font>

1058
01:54:27,340 --> 01:54:29,819
Right, rabbit?
Hmm.

1059
01:54:29,820 --> 01:54:33,534
Out of tricks.
Out of time.

1060
01:54:33,900 --> 01:54:36,299
And 1 bat head short.

1061
01:54:36,300 --> 01:54:38,623
<font color="#e2a5e1">20 seconds to animation.</font>

1062
01:54:38,624 --> 01:54:41,065
Ah. That will be the cook.
Excuse me.

1063
01:54:41,066 --> 01:54:44,019
Ah, Gotham roast.
Well done.

1064
01:54:44,020 --> 01:54:46,141
Hello.
Break the bad news.

1065
01:54:46,142 --> 01:54:49,099
I'd rather do the
breaking in person.

1066
01:54:49,100 --> 01:54:50,779
<font color="#e2a5e1">10 seconds to animation.</font>

1067
01:54:50,780 --> 01:54:51,859
You lost.

1068
01:54:51,860 --> 01:54:53,583
<font color="#e2a5e1">9.
8.</font>

1069
01:54:53,584 --> 01:54:54,819
I cannot let you win.

1070
01:54:54,820 --> 01:54:57,518
I gave the bat a fighting chance to do it.,
but he was not strong enough.

1071
01:54:57,519 --> 01:54:59,343
So, If man won't kill God,

1072
01:54:59,344 --> 01:55:02,156
<font color="#e2a5e1">2.
1.</font>

1073
01:55:03,260 --> 01:55:05,366
the Devil will do it!

1074
01:55:21,488 --> 01:55:24,692
- Perry.
- Alright. Stay calm, everybody!

1075
01:55:24,693 --> 01:55:26,499
We're getting reports,
there are total blackouts

1076
01:55:26,500 --> 01:55:28,963
in the north and to the
northwest of the city.

1077
01:55:28,964 --> 01:55:34,012
Federal authorities are trying to determine
if this is part of a larger terrorist attack.

1078
01:55:37,420 --> 01:55:41,067
Ancient Kryptonian deformity.

1079
01:55:41,300 --> 01:55:44,703
The blood of my blood.

1080
01:55:50,740 --> 01:55:53,520
Born to destroy you.

1081
01:55:55,740 --> 01:55:57,960
Your Doomsday.

1082
01:56:20,815 --> 01:56:26,157
Now God is good...
as dead.

1083
01:57:49,140 --> 01:57:50,819
POTUS joining.

1084
01:57:50,820 --> 01:57:53,019
- Mr. President.
- What the hell is it, Calvin?

1085
01:57:53,020 --> 01:57:55,728
These are live images from the
top of the LEXCORP tower

1086
01:57:55,729 --> 01:58:00,266
in downtown metropolis.
Military aircraft are on the scene.

1087
01:58:03,660 --> 01:58:08,299
This thing emerged from the
Kryptonian crash site just moments ago.

1088
01:58:08,300 --> 01:58:10,472
Thankfully the work day is over

1089
01:58:10,473 --> 01:58:13,080
in the downtown core,
it's nearly empty

1090
01:58:13,081 --> 01:58:15,099
Now.
Military aircraft

1091
01:58:15,100 --> 01:58:18,255
Those are Apache helicopters,
they have now just arrived.

1092
01:58:18,256 --> 01:58:19,783
The image...

1093
01:58:47,660 --> 01:58:51,106
We have uh... We just lost
connection with Metropolis 8 news.

1094
01:58:51,107 --> 01:58:54,565
Now, it's not clear
what just happened.

1095
01:58:56,983 --> 01:58:59,370
What happening there, Alfred?

1096
01:59:00,433 --> 01:59:02,375
How best to describe it?

1097
01:59:02,376 --> 01:59:04,300
Metropolis airspace has been closed briefly.

1098
01:59:04,301 --> 01:59:06,378
- Excuse me.
- I kindly ask you to stay in your seats.

1099
01:59:06,379 --> 01:59:07,979
Excuse me?

1100
01:59:07,980 --> 01:59:10,234
Miss Prince?

1101
01:59:23,619 --> 01:59:25,390
Sir.
Look, they cleared the city.

1102
01:59:25,391 --> 01:59:27,335
Looks like he's taking it into space.

1103
01:59:27,336 --> 01:59:29,299
We can go straight to Key RED,
Mr. President.

1104
01:59:29,300 --> 01:59:30,739
Not yet.
Are you crazy?

1105
01:59:30,740 --> 01:59:33,582
They are high enough and we can
nuke them with no casualties. Sir.

1106
01:59:33,583 --> 01:59:37,481
One casualty, Mr. President.
Superman.

1107
01:59:38,878 --> 01:59:41,709
God have mercy on us all.

1108
01:59:46,418 --> 01:59:48,299
- Key is hot.
- Key is hot.

1109
01:59:48,300 --> 01:59:51,610
Red Birds,
are armed to deploy, Sir.

1110
01:59:52,019 --> 01:59:53,319
Fire at will.

1111
01:59:53,320 --> 01:59:56,620
3. 2. 1.

1112
02:00:44,306 --> 02:00:46,286
Oh, God.

1113
02:01:01,980 --> 02:01:03,551
Projectile 1.
Impact.

1114
02:01:03,552 --> 02:01:05,459
Stryker's Island, east of Metropolis.

1115
02:01:05,460 --> 02:01:06,933
That's uninhabited.

1116
02:01:06,934 --> 02:01:09,074
Projectile 2.

1117
02:01:13,990 --> 02:01:15,979
No apparent re-entry.

1118
02:01:15,980 --> 02:01:17,939
Projectile 2?

1119
02:01:17,940 --> 02:01:23,733
Superman, Mr. President.
Projectile 2 is Superman.

1120
02:01:24,005 --> 02:01:25,985
Sir.

1121
02:01:26,322 --> 02:01:28,289
It's moving.

1122
02:02:08,376 --> 02:02:10,224
The shock waves are getting stronger.

1123
02:02:10,225 --> 02:02:13,379
Everytime we hit it,
we make it more powerful.

1124
02:02:13,380 --> 02:02:15,508
We can't attack.

1125
02:02:15,900 --> 02:02:18,384
What're you saying, Calvin?

1126
02:02:18,385 --> 02:02:20,838
I'm saying it's unkillable.

1127
02:02:48,360 --> 02:02:51,779
- Master Wayne, are you receiving me?
- Alfred.

1128
02:02:51,780 --> 02:02:56,059
It's Kryptonian.
Only Kryptonite weapons can kill it.

1129
02:02:56,060 --> 02:02:59,659
It might,
if you have any left.

1130
02:02:59,660 --> 02:03:01,998
I only got 1 round left.

1131
02:03:02,700 --> 02:03:05,554
The spear.
Alfred, the spear.

1132
02:03:05,555 --> 02:03:08,495
It's pure kryptonite.
It's back in Gotham.

1133
02:03:08,496 --> 02:03:11,659
If I can penetrate the skin,
the spear will kill it.

1134
02:03:11,660 --> 02:03:14,391
- It would in theory.
- I got to get it to chase me.

1135
02:03:14,392 --> 02:03:17,813
Back to the city.
Back to the kryptonite.

1136
02:04:16,189 --> 02:04:18,172
Oh, shit.

1137
02:05:07,381 --> 02:05:09,184
Why did you bring him
back to the city?

1138
02:05:09,185 --> 02:05:10,739
The port is abandoned.

1139
02:05:10,740 --> 02:05:13,408
And there's a weapon here
that can kill it.

1140
02:05:25,277 --> 02:05:27,390
Did you find the spear?

1141
02:05:27,420 --> 02:05:28,813
I've been a little busy.

1142
02:05:28,814 --> 02:05:33,522
This thing, this creature,
seems to feed on energy.

1143
02:05:34,175 --> 02:05:37,509
This thing is from another world.

1144
02:05:38,240 --> 02:05:39,579
My world.

1145
02:05:39,580 --> 02:05:42,885
I've killed things
from other worlds before.

1146
02:05:44,050 --> 02:05:45,939
Is she with you?

1147
02:05:45,940 --> 02:05:48,129
I thought she was with you.

1148
02:09:22,860 --> 02:09:24,513
Clark.

1149
02:09:33,408 --> 02:09:35,108
Clark.

1150
02:09:44,695 --> 02:09:46,432
Clark.

1151
02:09:46,489 --> 02:09:48,910
Clark.
Are you alright?

1152
02:10:26,107 --> 02:10:28,251
I love you.

1153
02:10:31,400 --> 02:10:32,992
No.

1154
02:10:33,315 --> 02:10:35,609
No, Clark, you can't.

1155
02:10:36,600 --> 02:10:38,439
This is my world.

1156
02:10:38,440 --> 02:10:40,629
No, Clark, don't.

1157
02:10:43,640 --> 02:10:46,004
You are my world.

1158
02:10:46,005 --> 02:10:47,745
No.

1159
02:10:50,299 --> 02:10:52,799
Please.
Clark!

1160
02:15:02,872 --> 02:15:08,170
SUPERMAN DEAD
NIGHT OF TERROR, MORNING OF LOSS

<font color="#a0bef5">Daily Planet Reporter Clark Kent

1162

Lex Luthor Arrested In Connection
With Capitol Bombing.

1163
02:15:52,640 --> 02:15:54,180
Hi.

1164
02:16:00,440 --> 02:16:04,346
Clark had this sent here
so he can surprise you.

1165
02:18:26,196 --> 02:18:30,279
All the circuses back east,
burying an empty box.

1166
02:18:30,280 --> 02:18:33,101
They don't know how
to honor him.

1167
02:18:33,360 --> 02:18:36,054
Except as a soldier.

1168
02:18:37,062 --> 02:18:41,067
I've failed him,
in life.

1169
02:18:41,720 --> 02:18:44,451
I won't fail him in death.

1170
02:18:45,600 --> 02:18:48,229
Help me find the others like you.

1171
02:18:48,230 --> 02:18:51,109
Perhaps they don't want to be found.

1172
02:18:51,120 --> 02:18:54,687
They will.
And they'll fight.

1173
02:18:55,185 --> 02:18:57,907
We have to stand together.

1174
02:19:04,760 --> 02:19:08,660
A 100 years ago
I walked away from mankind.

1175
02:19:10,080 --> 02:19:13,036
From the century of horrors.

1176
02:19:15,600 --> 02:19:19,915
Man made a world where
standing together is impossible.

1177
02:19:22,600 --> 02:19:24,988
Man is still good.

1178
02:19:26,960 --> 02:19:30,561
We fight.
We kill.

1179
02:19:30,960 --> 02:19:33,576
We betray one another.

1180
02:19:35,200 --> 02:19:37,497
But we can rebuild.

1181
02:19:38,519 --> 02:19:40,655
We can do better.

1182
02:19:41,640 --> 02:19:43,752
We will.

1183
02:19:43,753 --> 02:19:45,802
We have to.

1184
02:20:01,927 --> 02:20:07,445
IF YOU SEEK HIS
MONUMENT
LOOK AROUND YOU

1185
02:20:08,015 --> 02:20:09,505
The others like me.

1186
02:20:09,506 --> 02:20:12,426
Why did you say
they'll have to fight?

1187
02:20:17,190 --> 02:20:19,378
Just a feeling.

1188
02:20:29,165 --> 02:20:31,696
Turn around and face the wall.

1189
02:20:32,941 --> 02:20:35,441
Place your forehead
against the wall.

1190
02:20:35,442 --> 02:20:37,240
Put your hands behind your back,

1191
02:20:37,241 --> 02:20:39,948
so that I can come in
and restrain you.

1192
02:21:07,695 --> 02:21:10,584
Whatever you do.
Wherever you go.

1193
02:21:10,609 --> 02:21:13,188
I'll be watching.

1194
02:21:15,965 --> 02:21:20,940
But, the bells are already been rung,

1195
02:21:22,726 --> 02:21:25,125
and they've heard it.

1196
02:21:25,989 --> 02:21:27,795
Out in the dark.

1197
02:21:27,796 --> 02:21:30,498
Among the stars.

1198
02:21:33,510 --> 02:21:37,789
Ding dong, the God is dead.

1199
02:21:46,384 --> 02:21:49,866
The bells, cannot be unrung!

1200
02:21:50,540 --> 02:21:55,040
He's hungry.
He's found us.

1201
02:21:55,260 --> 02:21:57,579
And he's coming!

1202
02:22:00,060 --> 02:22:03,274
Ding ding ding ding
ding ding ding ding.

1203
02:22:04,894 --> 02:22:08,314
Ding ding ding ding
ding ding ding ding ding.

1204
02:22:09,620 --> 02:22:13,758
Ding ding ding ding

1205
02:22:14,411 --> 02:22:18,155
Ding ding ding ding
ding ding ding ding ding.

1206
02:22:19,100 --> 02:22:23,316
Ding ding ding ding
