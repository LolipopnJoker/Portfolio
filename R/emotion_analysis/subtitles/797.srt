1
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,800
All right, all right. All right, all right.

2
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,500
Never

3
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,900
say

4
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,100
no

5
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,500
Well, this is Kingman's
defining moment, Marv.

6
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,200
If they win, they guarantee themselves
a spot in the playoffs.

7
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,700
Everybody get on the King's back

8
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,500
and I'm going to lead you
to the promised land.

9
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,800
- All right? On one, on one. Ready?
- Break!

10
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,000
Go deep.
Watch your left!

11
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,100
Let's go!

12
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,900
Pick him up. Pick him up.

13
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,700
Sanders. Sanders.

14
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,400
Go wide!

15
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,800
Hut-hut!

16
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,800
Hut!

17
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,100
All right, here's
Kingman. Drops back in the pocket.

18
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,300
He's got Sanders wide open
in the end zone.

19
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,400
Kingman is on the run.
He's inside the five.

20
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,100
He stiff-arms. It's the Kingman swing.

21
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,400
And he is in! Touchdown, Rebels.
They've won it.

22
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,300
What a
tremendous play by Kingman, Marv.

23
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,700
But I have to wonder,
yesterday he was...

24
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,700
The King does it again!

25
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,100
- Go Joe!
- Go Joe!

26
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,100
- Never say no!
- Never say no!

27
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,200
Yeah!

28
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,600
WZPZ FM.

29
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,900
Hey, Boston. Happy New Year.
And a special shout out to our Rebels.

30
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,500
Don't party too hard, boys.

31
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,400
You're going to need all your strength
to bring home that championship.

32
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,000
- Enjoy your drink.
- To us.

33
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,100
Hope it's okay.

34
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,600
I'm telling you guys,
these aren't the normal onion rings.

35
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:14,600
They got garlic and mint leaves.
I mean, like, beluga caviar.

36
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,900
Hey, Coop. Coop, check it out.

37
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,100
- See the hottie? 12 o'clock, tan dress?
- Oh, yeah.

38
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,800
I think she said
you have a killer smile, bro.

39
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,200
I do.

40
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,600
You should go talk to her.

41
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,700
- You think so?
- I know so. Come on.

42
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,900
Get in there. Get in there.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, swamp mouth.

43
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,800
Use some of this. Chicks dig it.

44
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,300
- Webber, you got a pen?
- Why?

45
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,200
Because you might want
to take some notes.

46
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,100
What's up?

47
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,400
Webber!

48
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,600
I told you, they bumped up shoot.
I have to catch last flight to Paris.

49
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,600
But Tatianna will miss you.

50
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,100
The King doesn't want his queen
to miss him too much.

51
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,300
So I got you a little something special.

52
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,200
- Close your eyes.
- Okay.

53
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,900
Tatianna, Tatianna. Which one?
Which one?

54
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,400
No peeking.

55
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,200
Dreams are on Joe tonight, honey.

56
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,800
Happy New Year.

57
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,400
- Channel?
- Or Chanel.

58
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,100
Whoa, Sanders.
Where you going?

59
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,800
Just past your bedtime?

60
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,200
Yeah, well, you know,
it's New Year's Eve.

61
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,400
Want to go home,
hug the wife, kiss the kids.

62
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,100
All right, thanks for coming.
Happy New Year.

63
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,900
- All right, Happy New Year.
- All right, see you at practice.

64
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,500
All right, see you.

65
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,900
All right, Joe. Come on, it's real funny.

66
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,400
Now, just give me back the wallet,
all right?

67
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,500
I'm looking to confiscate
Sanders' man card,

68
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,000
but his wife, Maria,
has already done it.

69
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,000
- Yes, really...
- Come on. Get a life, Sanders.

70
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,800
Oh, you call this "life"?
That ain't life, Joe.

71
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,500
Oh, you call this "life"?
That ain't life, Joe.

72
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,700
- Whatever.
- He's mad. That was funny, man.

73
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,200
- Who's ready to party?
- I am.

74
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,700
Party!

75
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,200
Yeah!

76
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,500
Where can I get a man card?

77
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,100
- Why? The night is still young!
- We can walk Spike.

78
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,800
- Play the guitars, Joe. Come on.
- We were just bonding.

79
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,300
- I love that idea.
- We're starting to jell.

80
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,900
- Call me.
- Joe...

81
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,900
We were doing so good.

82
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,400
Hey, Spike. There's my boy.
Haven't seen you all night.

83
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,500
Do you know who the greatest
quarterback of all time is?

84
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,800
Just checking. Let's go! Huddle up!

85
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,200
Can you feel it? Can you smell it?
Do you believe it?

86
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,300
Z- slant Mississippi! On three. Ready?
Break! Hut! Hut! Hut!

87
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,800
Come on, Spike.
We need a football biscuit.

88
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,100
Oh, that's a good one.
Oh, this is a good one.

89
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,800
Kingman drops back, he's...
Oh, defenders are coming around.

90
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,200
Post pattern, Spike. Post pattern.

91
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,700
He throws.

92
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,500
Touchdown! They're going crazy.

93
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,600
Crazy.

94
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,400
<i>Gracias, Rosa. Enjoy your vacation.</i>

95
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,500
What do you want to do, Spike?
What do you want to do today?

96
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,200
It's a new year.

97
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,200
You want to play football?
You want to go for a walk?

98
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:51,300
You want to watch the new ESPN
special profile on Joe Kingman?

99
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,800
I know you do. Me, too. Watch. Watch.
Here we go.

100
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,300
Attaboy.

101
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,800
<i>Blessed with crazy strength and
ridiculous agility...</i>

102
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,200
Ridiculous.

103
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,000
<i>...Joe Kingman could have succeeded
on talent alone.</i>

104
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,800
<i>But what really sets
this future hall-of-famer apart</i>

105
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,500
<i>is his passion for the game.</i>

106
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,400
<i>And no one sums it up better
than Joe himself.</i>

107
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,600
<i>- Wait a minute, that's not what I said.
- Listen, listen.</i>

108
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,700
<i>- What I said was this. Life...
- Life...</i>

109
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,800
<i>...holds many pleasures for me.
... holds many pleasures for me.</i>

110
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,400
<i>- But...
- But...</i>

111
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,000
<i>...nothing...
... nothing...</i>

112
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,000
<i>...nothing beats the thrill...
... nothing beats the thrill...</i>

113
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,900
<i>...of playing on that field...
... of playing on that field...</i>

114
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
<i>...every Sunday.
... every Sunday.</i>

115
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,600
<i>- Football is my life.
- Football is my life.</i>

116
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,100
<i>- Beyond the field...
- Beyond the field...</i>

117
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,500
<i>...nothing else matters.
... nothing else matters. Watch this.</i>

118
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,600
<i>Nothing.</i>

119
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,000
<i>If nothing else really matters,</i>

120
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,500
<i>why does that championship ring
elude Kingman?</i>

121
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,000
<i>Some of the experts say
it's because he's too selfish.</i>

122
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,300
<i>I mean, think about it...</i>

123
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,300
How does that sound, Stuey?

124
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,700
<i>Joe, you're a 30-something now,
not a 20-something.</i>

125
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,500
<i>The clock is ticking, Joe.
Ticking on your career.</i>

126
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,900
Blah, blah, blah...

127
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,900
You come talk to me when you have
your own action figure, Stuey.

128
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,600
<i>- Yeah?
Pardon me, Mr. Kingman.</i>

129
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,400
I have a visitor here at reception.

130
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,600
<i>- A Peyton Kelly, sir.
- I don't know any Peytons.</i>

131
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,300
A young lady.

132
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,400
- Is she cute?
- Oh, exceedingly so, sir.

133
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,700
Well, what are you waiting for, Larry?
Send her up.

134
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,600
He never says "no. "

135
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,000
I am the king. Thank you very much.

136
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,700
Hmm.

137
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,400
Look out.

138
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,600
Hello.

139
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,300
- Goodbye.
Hey!

140
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,900
Look, kid, I don't do Girl Scout cookies,
okay?

141
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,300
You don't get abs like these

142
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,900
eating Peanut Butter Patties,
you know?

143
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,900
Go ahead, hit me. Come on!
Give it a shot. Come on.

144
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,700
It's ridiculous, isn't it?

145
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,100
Bye-bye.

146
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,200
It's ridiculous.

147
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,100
I don't know what it is you're selling.
Look what I have, here's a hundo.

148
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,300
I don't want any money. I want...

149
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,200
I know. I know what you want. I get it.
It's what the world wants.

150
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,600
An autograph of Joe Kingman.
They all want it, eight to 80.

151
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,300
You'll probably go sell it,
but I'm going to give it to you for free.

152
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,500
Because I'm Joe Kingman,
humanitarian.

153
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,800
Happy New Year. I'll be right back.

154
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,600
You have a bulldog. Come here, boy.

155
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,300
You're so cute.

156
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,700
Easy, easy.
He's a very vicious attack dog.

157
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,700
Yeah. He's going to lick me to death.

158
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,000
Listen, you just can't come walking
into strangers' homes like this.

159
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,300
There are a lot of weirdos out there
in the world.

160
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,400
- Didn't your mom ever teach you that?
- Yeah.

161
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,900
- Well, where is she?
- On an airplane.

162
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,200
On an airplane?
Well, who are you here with?

163
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,300
My father.

164
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,200
Well, you better go get him,
because I'm sure he's looking for you.

165
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,400
- He's not looking for me.
- How do you know?

166
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,500
Because he's looking at me.

167
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,100
What?

168
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:25,100
Hi, we've never met before.
You were married to my mom, Sara.

169
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,600
Sara Kelly?

170
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,000
My name is Peyton. I'm your daughter.

171
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,200
No. No. Nope. No!

172
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,100
No. Time out.
Sara and I never had a kid.

173
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,300
- She wrote you a note.
- Wrote me a note.

174
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,900
"Joe, I know this is a big surprise,
but Peyton is your daughter.

175
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,600
"I need you to watch her for a month.
It's an emergency.

176
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,900
"I'll explain everything
when I get back. Sara. "

177
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,300
You sure got a lot of pictures
of yourself in here.

178
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,600
You expect me to believe
you're my kid, based on this?

179
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,700
- Anybody could have written this.
- Oh, yeah.

180
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,400
I've also got this.
It's my birth certificate.

181
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,200
Birth certificate?

182
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,200
- Your name is on it.
- My name is...

183
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,600
My name?

184
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,800
Awesome!

185
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,200
<i>Ready? Break!</i>

186
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,300
My name's not on this.

187
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,300
"Joseph Kingman. "

188
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,100
<i>Hut! Hut! Hut!</i>

189
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,600
<i>- We've got a situation.
- Touchdown!</i>

190
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,600
Fix it.

191
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,500
Oh!

192
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,900
Don't you think
you should have told me about this?

193
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,300
- I didn't know.
- You didn't know you had an ex-wife?

194
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,400
That was a long time ago.
We were crazy in love, but too young.

195
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,400
Didn't even last longer than a year,
and we never had a baby.

196
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,100
Okay, but for argument's sake,

197
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,400
is there the teeniest, tiniest possibility
that this child could be yours?

198
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,600
Think hard.

199
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,000
I don't know.

200
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,100
We got the separation,
the divorce was final,

201
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,500
she came by to pick up
a few of her things and then we...

202
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,700
We...

203
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,200
Is anyone else hungry?

204
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,300
- Hungry?
- Joe...

205
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,600
When did this, "We... We...
Is anyone else hungry" happen?

206
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,900
About eight, nine years ago.

207
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,900
- How old are you, kid?
- Eight.

208
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,400
Congratulations, Joe.

209
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,000
This isn't happening to me.

210
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,400
Muffin, just talk to your Auntie Stella.

211
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,600
Hmm?

212
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:27,000
It says here that your mom
is not coming back for a month.

213
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,500
She's on her way to Africa.

214
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,400
What kind of a selfish,
self-centered person dumps their kid...

215
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,900
She's on a water sanitation project
bringing fresh drinking water

216
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,900
to the drought-ravaged children
of the Sudan.

217
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,400
If I had a dime
for every time I heard that one.

218
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,000
So on her way to save the world,

219
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,600
your mom just suddenly decided
to leave you here?

220
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:52,400
I begged her. I said,
"Well, why don't I stay with my father?"

221
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,800
And she said, "Well, baby, he doesn't
know about you yet. " And I said...

222
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,500
I get it. I get it.
So, who else can you stay with?

223
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,900
I got it. I got it. I'm a genius.

224
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,400
Sara has a sister.

225
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,000
Goombah, Grip, Grime... Carmen!

226
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,300
- Karen.
- Karen. What about her?

227
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,600
She's...

228
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,000
She's dead.

229
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,000
Oh, that's convenient.

230
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,900
What?

231
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,200
How do we get in touch
with your mom?

232
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,300
- Her cell won't work in Kassala.
- Email?

233
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,200
They don't have Internet there.

234
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,900
How did you get here again?

235
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,700
We flew to Boston together,
and then she put me in a car.

236
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,700
And the car just magically
dropped you off at some man's house?

237
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,900
- Not some man. My father.
- So you say.

238
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,900
- Want a paternity test?
- Yes. That's a great idea.

239
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,900
Let's do that. No problem.

240
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,600
I don't like needles.
So if they don't take blood, no problem.

241
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,800
Not in the middle of negotiating
our Fanny's deal, it's not.

242
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,100
These things never stay quiet,
trust me.

243
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,400
If she does turn out to be yours,

244
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,300
you'll look like a guy
who had a kid and ditched her

245
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,900
and you can
kiss your mega-bucks goodbye.

246
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,500
- Stella.
- Hmm.

247
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,500
We don't even look alike.

248
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,600
Oh, no. Not at all.

249
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,900
- Thanks a lot for the heads up, Larry.
- Hey, I told you she was cute.

250
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,200
I'm late.

251
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,300
Let's go. No huddle.

252
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,600
- No back seat.
- So what? Get in the car.

253
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,000
If you get in an accident,
the air bag will hurt me.

254
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,000
Oh, come on, I don't have time
for the safety lesson, please!

255
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,700
Come here.

256
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,800
So late.

257
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,300
I've got four weeks
to make up for eight years,

258
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,500
so let's get started, shall we?

259
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,100
I'm going to ask you some questions

260
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,400
and you're going to give me
some answers, okay?

261
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,000
Now, for example,

262
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:36,500
if you asked me what my favorite thing
to do was, I would say ballet.

263
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,600
So what's your favorite thing to do?

264
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,800
That's easy. Play football.

265
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,900
Football.

266
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,300
Come on!

267
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,800
If you could only save one thing
in a fire, what would it be?

268
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,900
My Heisman.

269
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,800
No, wait... I know.

270
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,000
My limited edition
Joe Kingman sneakers.

271
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,500
Come on, horseradish.
No more questions.

272
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,400
Just one more question.

273
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,700
What's the best thing
that's ever happened to you?

274
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,200
Listen, I got a question for you.

275
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,000
Why didn't your mom
just bring you here herself?

276
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,500
Want a cookie?

277
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,900
No, I don't want a cookie.
Stop trying to change the subject.

278
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,800
But you said you were hungry.

279
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,500
- And I made them special for you.
- Fine, fine.

280
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,100
- Now, about your mom.
- I told you, it was last-minute.

281
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,500
I just can't believe that the Sara I knew

282
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,300
would just let her daughter
show up at my doorstep alone.

283
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,300
I know what happened.

284
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,700
- You do?
- Yeah.

285
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,200
- She's gained a lot of weight.
- No.

286
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,800
What's she pushing now? About 180?

287
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,000
Deuce?

288
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,700
Let's go.

289
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,300
What do you think, you're some
roaming free safety or something?

290
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,900
This is "cover-two," little lady,
so stay close.

291
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Are you okay?

292
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,600
Do I sound okay?
What did you put in those cookies?

293
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:26,200
- Milk, flour, eggs and cinnamon...
- Cinnamon!

294
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,800
Cinnamon? I'm allergic to cinnamon.

295
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,500
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- All you got to say is, "I'm sorry"?

296
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,500
I sound like this, "I'm sorry"?
Cinnamon!

297
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,700
I'm allergic to nuts.

298
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,000
Joe. Joe, don't forget I got that
publicity shoot set up for you today.

299
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,200
- You have to be there this time.
- I'll be there.

300
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,800
What do you think,
I'm stupid or something?

301
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,600
Stop touching me.

302
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,600
Stop eating so much.

303
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,100
- You're late, Joe. That's a $500 fine.
- Start a tab.

304
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,700
Hey, sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.

305
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,500
King's here, Danville. I got it.
King's here.

306
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,600
Get a submarine sandwich
and a diet soda.

307
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,800
All right, let's go. Sixty-six seam,
slot left on three, on three. Ready?

308
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,900
All right, let's go. Sixty-six seam,
slot left on three, on three. Ready?

309
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,700
Suffering succotash,
Sylvester,

310
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,300
something seems to be wrong
with your mouth.

311
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,200
I said sixty-six, slot seam left on three.
On three. Ready?

312
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,600
Hey, Joe.
Looks like you got a rogue fan.

313
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,400
- I'm not a fan. I'm Joe's daughter.
- What's everybody staring at?

314
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,700
I didn't know Joe had a kid.

315
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,200
Yo, I don't think Joe knew
Joe had a kid.

316
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,400
- Stay here.
- Yes, sir.

317
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Hat.

318
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,100
Give me this!

319
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,200
Here's what you got to read right there.
You all set?

320
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,900
Here we go. And three, two, one... Go!

321
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,300
Boston Rebels! Experience the heat!

322
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,600
Boston Rebels! Catch the magic.

323
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:11,200
Boston Rebels! Feel the...
Wait a minute. Who writes this?

324
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,500
Hey, let's get Joe.
He won't be expecting it.

325
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,600
We'll put ice in his bath.

326
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,300
Coop, look. Look real close.

327
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,900
Joe is in an ice bath.

328
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,100
- Well, we'll put colder ice in it.
- Glove.

329
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,600
Yeah.

330
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,500
Webber, think about this.

331
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,500
Big surprise, eh, Kingman?

332
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,000
More like a safety blitz.

333
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,300
Yeah, well, you should be happy.

334
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,600
I remember how happy I was
when my kids were born.

335
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,900
Yeah, but you knew
they were coming.

336
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,600
Yeah, well, either way, she's here now.

337
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,500
What's your name, sweetheart?

338
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,300
- Peyton.
- Peyton, that's cute.

339
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,000
- Hi, Peyton.
- Hi.

340
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,200
Oh, that's cool.
Like... Like, Peyton Manning?

341
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,500
No, dude.
It's like Walter Payton, right?

342
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,300
No. Peyton Rous.

343
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,500
- Who's that?
- He won the Nobel Prize.

344
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,100
For what team?

345
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,800
In medicine.

346
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,500
He's not even a football player.
That's stupid.

347
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,800
"Stupid" is a mean word.

348
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,600
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

349
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,700
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

350
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,800
- Isn't.
- Is!

351
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,900
- Isn't.
- Is!

352
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,800
Quiet. Both of you.

353
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,400
Step away from my pants.

354
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,700
Awkward.

355
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,400
Hey, sweetie, it's okay.

356
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,800
See, those are Monroe's
very special underwear.

357
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,800
You see,
he needs to wear them every game,

358
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,600
- or he thinks we won't win.
- Oh.

359
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,000
<i>Hey, I'm on SportsCenter again.</i>

360
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,200
I'm hungry.

361
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,900
Please don't touch anything.
Stand right here.

362
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,600
Tonight's Tuesday.
We're going to carbo-load.

363
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,100
Twenty-twenty-sixty ratio.

364
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,200
What?

365
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,800
Hey, do you have any Jell-O?
I want some Jell-O.

366
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,700
Like I said, please don't touch.
Fingerprints. I don't like fingerprints.

367
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,800
Stand right here, don't do anything.

368
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,300
I'm not giving you 28 grams
of empty carbohydrates.

369
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,400
We do not do simple sugars
in this house.

370
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,500
But I'm a kid and kids love sugar.
I mean, the simpler the better.

371
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,400
Well, my dad never let me have sugar.

372
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,300
Oh, is that why you never smile?

373
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,200
Mmm.

374
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,800
Listen, you better eat your food
before it gets cold.

375
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,900
But it's as big as a mountain.

376
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,400
Listen, if you're going to make the pros,
you have to get your appetite up.

377
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,000
Let's go. Eat.

378
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,500
You got a little...

379
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,800
- A little something right here.
- What?

380
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,700
I got what?

381
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,300
I'm going to go and wash the dishes.

382
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,900
You can eat.

383
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:25,000
And finish eating.

384
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,000
I don't have a guest room
because I don't like guests.

385
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,800
But you can sleep here.

386
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,400
- What's this?
- That is a universal remote.

387
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,000
It controls the world.
And you don't need to touch it.

388
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,100
What's the "romance" button for?

389
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:50,100
The romance button
is for a little Valentine's Day magic.

390
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,900
Turn... Turn this off. Turn it off.
Turn it off.

391
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,400
Turn it off. Press the button.
Turn it off.

392
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,200
Stop touching things.

393
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,600
Aren't you going to tell me
a bedtime story?

394
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,900
Bedtime story... Bedtime story.

395
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,800
Yeah.

396
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,000
The Big Bad Wolf

397
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,700
blew down the Grammy's house

398
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,800
and ate the Goldilocks

399
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,100
and then there was something
about the porridge.

400
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,400
The end.

401
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,700
Good night.

402
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,300
I mean a real bedtime story, Joe.

403
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,300
A bedtime story is supposed
to make you feel peaceful.

404
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,300
I'll show you.

405
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,300
Lean back, relax,
and listen to the story.

406
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:58,100
Fine. Fine. I'm going to listen
to this one time, then that's it.

407
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,100
Then you go to sleep.
Do you understand me?

408
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,300
Once upon a time there was a princess

409
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,300
and she had a lot of beautiful dresses.

410
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,100
She had a pink dress, a red dress,

411
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,700
a blue dress, a green dress,
a purple dress,

412
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,800
- an orange dress, a yellow dress...
- I get it. I get it. I get it.

413
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,200
A lot of dresses, a lot of colors.
So what?

414
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
So each dress had a secret power.

415
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,500
The pink dress,
which had pink sparkles all over it,

416
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,600
could make her fly.

417
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:34,500
And the blue dress,
which had blue sparkles all over it,

418
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,800
could make her tiny.

419
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:42,100
And the green dress,
which had green sparkles all over it,

420
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,400
could make her sleep.

421
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,500
Whoa!

422
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,400
Hey, baby.

423
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,600
Why didn't you answer me
when I called?

424
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,800
I was starting to get worried.

425
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:18,900
I'm sorry. I forgot I had
my phone turned off from the flight.

426
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:23,000
Well, I'm just happy that you got
there safely. So, how's it going?

427
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:28,800
Great. Well, the food's not so hot,
but my room is huge.

428
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,900
Well, that's very cool,
but how's the ballet?

429
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,400
I mean, is it as good as they promised?

430
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,900
Too soon to tell.

431
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Hey, listen, sweetie, it's almost
time for my flight to take off,

432
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:42,200
but I will call you
as soon as I can, okay?

433
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,600
I miss you so much already.

434
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,900
E- mail me lots of pictures.
And Peyton, I love you.

435
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,400
I love you, too. Bye.

436
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,200
Is there a ballet school close by?

437
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,900
Spike?

438
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:11,200
Why is my dog in a dress
with pink nail polish?

439
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,400
<i>He's learning Swan Lake.</i>

440
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,600
Do you know how to fix
a ballerina bun?

441
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,200
Do I look like I know
how to fix a ballerina bun?

442
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,000
My mom says we're not supposed to
pop our knuckles.

443
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,400
Well, your mom
didn't sleep on a hard sofa

444
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:39,500
instead of her specially designed
$ 10,000 orthopedic bed

445
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:44,000
made by Dr. Johan Gustavo,
of Switzerland.

446
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:52,000
- What's... What's with the Beethoven?
- It's Tchaikovsky.

447
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,400
- Do you listen to this every morning?
- No.

448
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,500
Sometimes I listen to Bach,
or Rachmaninoff...

449
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,500
Do you have an iPod?

450
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:06,300
Because I'm going to buy you one.
Immediately. Right now.

451
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,400
I'm going to buy you an iPod.

452
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,000
Until then...

453
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,500
Whoa...

454
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,700
What is this?

455
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,900
My Bedazzler.
Doesn't Camille look pretty?

456
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,200
A Bedazzler?

457
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:30,500
And that's why I use
tuna for protein and flavor.

458
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,700
Mmm.

459
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,600
- Gross.
- Little liquid chickens.

460
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,800
Yeah, that's my favorite.

461
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,900
Joe's juice.

462
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,800
Okay. That's enough.

463
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,400
I'm gonna need you to drink up.

464
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,800
You'll be running the 40
in under 4.5 in no time.

465
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,600
That smells worse than school food.

466
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,800
You know, speaking of school,
why aren't you in it?

467
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,000
- I'm on break.
- In January? No you're not.

468
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:08,500
Yes, I am. I go to a magnet school,
so I have January off.

469
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,300
Really? Well, guess what?
I'm not on break.

470
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,700
As a matter of fact,
I'm on the opposite of break.

471
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,900
So I'm gonna need you
to come over here,

472
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,800
put some hustle in it,
and drink your breakfast.

473
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,400
- Peyton, stop messing around.
- What?

474
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,400
Peyton!

475
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,500
No!

476
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,800
Nice.

477
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,500
That's real nice.

478
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:49,500
- You know what a playbook is?
- I'm guessing it's a book with plays?

479
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:55,400
Oh, I get it. The Xs are for kisses
and the Os for hugs.

480
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,600
Wrong! The X's mean
"stay out of these areas of the house. "

481
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,300
The O's mean "open access. "

482
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,500
For example, you want to go
to the kitchen, straight buttonhook.

483
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,400
But now you go to the kitchen, big X.

484
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,600
Off limits. No access.

485
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,400
Can't go there, because you made
a mess in the kitchen.

486
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,800
Do you understand?

487
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,400
No trick plays, no flea-flickers. Got it?

488
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,100
Got it. No flea-flickers.

489
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,700
This is your game plan.
Learn it. Live it. Love it.

490
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,900
That's it, boys.
Practice is over.

491
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,900
Pick a nanny, Joe.

492
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,500
- I'll take the one at...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

493
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:38,200
Don't you think
you should ask some questions first?

494
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,600
I've got great instincts.

495
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,500
The one on the end, Stella.

496
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,700
Edna.

497
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,900
The other end, Stella.

498
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,600
Blondie, you're up.

499
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,400
Oh, no. No.

500
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,400
The King picked me!

501
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,700
We are going to be just like sisters!

502
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,600
Oh, my goodness.

503
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
You start tomorrow.

504
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,900
Hey. You're going
to the opening tonight, right?

505
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,900
It's my restaurant.

506
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,400
Oh.

507
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,400
Well, what are you
going to do with her?

508
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,500
I don't know.

509
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,300
Hi. Hello.

510
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,800
Welcome, Mr. Kingman.

511
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,300
- The Maloofs!
- About time, there, Joe.

512
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,700
You made it. Have fun.

513
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,700
- Yeah.
- Enjoy yourself.

514
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,400
- Hey, Joe.
- Hey, man.

515
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,700
- How you doing?
- Hey.

516
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,000
- Jo Jo!
- Hey, nice to see you.

517
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,800
Hey, everything's on Joe tonight.

518
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,600
And that's exactly what I said.
I told them.

519
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,500
I said, "Listen, I'm the greatest. "

520
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,300
The purple or the yellow?

521
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,800
Hmm.

522
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,400
Mmm?

523
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,100
Mmm.

524
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,800
That's what I was thinking, too.

525
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,700
I'll be back.

526
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,900
Water the lawn. Water the lawn.

527
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,200
Hey, great night, Mr. Kingman.

528
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,600
Indeed it was, Jay. Indeed it was.

529
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,600
Hey, Joe! This way!

530
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:54,000
Number one on the field
and number one in your heart.

531
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:02,800
<i>I've got sunshine</i>

532
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,900
<i>On a cloudy day</i>

533
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Yes, I do.

534
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:12,500
<i>When it's cold outside</i>

535
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:16,700
<i>I've got the month of May</i>

536
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,900
<i>I guess you'd say</i>

537
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,800
<i>What can make me</i>

538
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,900
<i>What can make me</i>

539
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,100
<i>feel this way</i>

540
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,200
<i>My girl</i>

541
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,300
Joe?

542
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,200
<i>My girl</i>

543
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,700
<i>Talking about my girl</i>

544
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,800
My girl... Peyton!

545
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,800
Joe?

546
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,100
Joe. Joe, where are you?

547
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,000
There you are.
Joe, I thought you forgot about me.

548
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:54,000
Peyton! Peyton! Peyton!

549
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,700
Hey, Joe, is that your daughter?
- Peyton!

550
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,600
Hey, Joe, you forget something?

551
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,100
Father of the year!

552
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,800
Yesterday, Fanny's Burgers
agreed to hand out

553
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,700
your action figure
with every order of fries.

554
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,700
But do you think
they're going to want a spokesman

555
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,800
who forgot his child in a bar?

556
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,900
Hmm?

557
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,700
My mom says that Fanny's
makes kids fat and gives them gas.

558
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,300
Well, your daddy's agent says
Fanny's makes him fat with cash.

559
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,400
Now, I have to put together
a press conference, do some cleanup.

560
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,700
I'm the janitor, Joe's the mop,
and Peyton's the mess.

561
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,700
What?

562
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,800
- Something funny, Larry?
- Just a little throat tickle, sir.

563
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,700
Well, get it fixed.

564
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,800
Right here. Chop-chop.

565
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,300
You got a station wagon, Stella?

566
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,700
No, you did.

567
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:58,200
Say "bye-bye" to being
the Big Bad Dad of Boston.

568
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,100
Oh, no.

569
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,700
Oh, yes.

570
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
You want me to sign that?

571
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,200
Peyton, sweetie, be a good girl
and cooperate with your daddy

572
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,100
and Auntie Stella will get you a nice
new BlackBerry with a Bluetooth.

573
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,500
And an upgrade
on your next international flight.

574
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,700
I'm eight.

575
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,200
Listen, Bratty McPain-in-the-Butt,

576
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,600
you will do whatever it takes
to help your father.

577
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,900
I'll pay for the therapy.

578
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,400
Listen, Peyton,
what Stella's trying to say here is

579
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,000
this right now is crunch time.

580
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,800
So, if something's bothering you,
then all you got to do...

581
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,600
Let's keep it bottled up
until after the playoffs.

582
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,700
Fine.

583
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,900
On one condition.

584
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,900
No nanny.

585
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,400
No way.

586
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,100
Hey...

587
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:12,200
- Let's go. Come on.
- I'm feeling a little dizzy, Joe.

588
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,400
Everything's all...

589
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,900
- Dizzy?
- I think it might be

590
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,400
from that funny yellow soft drink
Joe gave me last night.

591
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,600
What was it called again?

592
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,900
Margarita?

593
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,700
- You wouldn't.
- You wouldn't.

594
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,500
Try me.

595
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:36,200
Good morning, Joe. I'm ready to start!

596
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,100
Hey, Cindy!

597
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,700
You're fired.

598
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,400
Bye.

599
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,100
Joe! Joe!

600
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,700
Hey, Joe,
how can you remember the plays

601
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,300
when you can't remember
you have a daughter?

602
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,500
Joe, what is an 8-year-old girl doing
in a nightclub at 3:00 in the morning?

603
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,400
<i>Thank you. Thank you guys
so much for coming out.</i>

604
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,000
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

605
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,100
<i>thank you so much for coming.</i>

606
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,400
<i>Great questions, by the way.
Thank you.</i>

607
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:08,100
<i>As you all know by now,
I've recently learned I'm a father.</i>

608
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,300
<i>And clearly,
I'm still getting the hang of things.</i>

609
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,900
That's not an excuse, Joe.

610
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:22,300
<i>But you better believe that Peyton's
nightclub evenings are behind her.</i>

611
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,300
<i>Because from now on, we're both
going to be going to sleep early, right?</i>

612
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,300
<i>Now, who's number one on the field
and number one in your heart?</i>

613
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,000
<i>Let's go.</i>

614
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,100
<i>Can I say something, please?</i>

615
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,400
No. Let's go.

616
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,800
<i>Hi, everybody, I'm Peyton,</i>

617
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:51,000
<i>the one who'll be going to bed early
from now on.</i>

618
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,200
<i>My dad didn't have much of
a heads-up on this whole father thing</i>

619
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:04,100
<i>and he is still
getting the hang of things.</i>

620
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,400
<i>But it's like everything else in his life.</i>

621
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,300
<i>He never says "no. "</i>

622
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:13,000
<i>I mean, he's teaching me
that you can do anything</i>

623
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:16,800
<i>if you've got motivation
and determination.</i>

624
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,700
<i>And the place where that starts</i>

625
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,900
<i>is right here, in the heart.</i>

626
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,900
<i>You're the world's greatest father.</i>

627
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,800
That was good.

628
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,400
- That was really good.
- It's going to cost you.

629
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,800
...two, three, four, grand plié...

630
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,900
There you go, there you go.

631
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,000
And...

632
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,300
Come on, this isn't a sport.

633
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,700
Football. Football's a sport.

634
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,400
Excuse me. Hi. Can I help you?

635
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,300
Hello. This is Peyton.

636
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:07,200
- Hi.
- And she's here for this.

637
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,000
So, I guess I'll be back
in a couple of hours. Bye.

638
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,100
Well, class started 15 minutes ago,

639
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,300
and we don't accept students
without an audition

640
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,400
and that happened last month,
so I'm really sorry.

641
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,800
I'm sure maybe we can
work something out?

642
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,200
Money's no object,
as you probably know.

643
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:28,900
Okay, the thing is
that this is a professional school, and...

644
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,900
- That's very nice.
- Thank you.

645
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,600
Go change, go on, go change.

646
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,600
Let me see how she does today. Okay?

647
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,100
All right.

648
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,900
Maybe I'll... I'll try and...
We'll get somebody...

649
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,300
The moms sit over there.

650
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,400
Excuse me. Thank you.

651
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,900
And one, two, three, very long...

652
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,900
Come on, come on.

653
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,400
And one, two, three, four.

654
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,300
Open up, like a princess, chin up.

655
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,700
Thank you.

656
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,100
Beautiful class, everybody. Beautiful.

657
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,800
Peyton, come here.
Can I tell you that that was so, so good.

658
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,300
Peyton, come here.
Can I tell you that that was so, so good.

659
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,300
Thank you.

660
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,500
Our next big performance
is in three weeks.

661
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:34,600
But if you promise me that you're going
to work extra, extra, super, super, hard,

662
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,100
we'd love to have you.

663
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:40,100
- I'll come every single day.
- All day, every day.

664
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:43,300
Well, it is a ballet school,
not a childcare facility.

665
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,200
And when we make a commitment
to a student,

666
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,700
we ask that the parents
make a commitment to the school.

667
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,800
Can you do that?

668
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,800
Well, I think you can make
a little exception for me.

669
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,800
- And why is that?
- You don't know who I am?

670
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:56,900
No.

671
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:01,700
I'm Joe Kingman, baby!
The quarterback of the Boston Rebels.

672
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,000
Number one on that field

673
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:06,700
and number one
in your pretty little heart.

674
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,200
"The King of the Gridiron. "

675
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,200
"Never-Say-No Joe?"

676
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,800
No? Nothing?

677
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:18,800
Odd.

678
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:22,300
- Well, don't you know who I am?
- No.

679
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,700
I'm Monique Vasquez,
the lady with the ballet school,

680
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,200
the one that doesn't accept
any new students full-time

681
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:32,300
unless she knows for a fact
that the parents are going to help out.

682
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:37,200
That's fine. Fine. I promise. Whatever.
Let's go.

683
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,900
Who doesn't know
who Joe Kingman is?

684
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,100
She must be living under a rock.

685
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,600
<i>Raef will take it this time.
- He shoots! Come on!</i>

686
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:44,800
<i>- Got it.
- Yeah!</i>

687
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,100
<i>I didn't see what happened
to Paul Pierce.</i>

688
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,200
<i>We'll be right back</i>

689
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,300
<i>- after a word from our...
- Let's go, Paul!</i>

690
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,400
I can't believe they came from 10 down.

691
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:54,900
Hey, keep this clean. Use the napkins.

692
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,600
Don't look at me like that.
Use a napkin.

693
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:00,900
Yeah, you tell him. You tell him, Spike.
Mean old Daddy.

694
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:02,700
Let's get Webber.

695
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:12,900
Webber, you want a soda?

696
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Huh?

697
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,800
Yeah. Yeah, thanks.

698
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,300
Oh...

699
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:27,200
- That's refreshing.
- Good one.

700
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:28,700
What's up, Joe?

701
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,900
I don't know, Coop. What do you think?
That's a $40,000 couch.

702
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I asked you to be careful!

703
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,900
- Which bathroom should I use?
- The one off the trophy room.

704
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:38,700
Come on, Pierce!

705
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,000
Paul Pierce comes down
with the board.

706
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,500
The man's a beast.
You saw that, Joe. You saw that.

707
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,300
That's why the Celtics
are my team for life.

708
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,700
Celtics got this one locked up.

709
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,300
Hold on, hold on...

710
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,700
Wait a second. Wait a minute.
Little bit more.

711
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,700
Stop growling. Hold on.
One, two, three.

712
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:08,600
What did I do?

713
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:10,100
Let's go, Paul Pierce.
Time to come through.

714
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,300
- Okay, here we go, baby. Here we go.
- Three seconds left.

715
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,300
<i>Welcome to
the Magical World of Ponies.</i>

716
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:18,700
What happened?

717
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,100
Get it back! Get it back!
Get the game back!

718
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,300
Get the mechanicals!

719
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,700
The mechanicals.
The mechanicals, Joe!

720
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,600
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying! I'm trying!

721
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,300
It's right there. See?

722
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,400
<i>Unbelievable!</i>

723
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,300
We missed it!

724
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,800
<i>- You gotta celebrate.
- Peyton.</i>

725
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,500
What did I do?

726
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:49,600
Thanks, Joe. Let's go, guys.

727
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,900
Wait. Where are you going?

728
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:55,100
You don't have to leave.
Where are you guys going?

729
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,900
- I got to get home to...
- Where?

730
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:57,900
Nothing.

731
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,100
What did I tell you
about touching the remote?

732
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,400
Bath. Bed. Now.

733
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,800
Just got to add a little bit
of bubble bath.

734
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:12,100
Not too much. That's good.

735
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:14,700
Perfect.

736
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,800
This could take a while.

737
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,700
<i>But what really sets
this future Hall of Famer apart...</i>

738
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:31,900
Passion for the game.

739
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:36,000
Spike, you know the rule,
no barking when I'm on TV!

740
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,200
Spike!

741
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,500
Spike?

742
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,900
What happened?

743
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,400
Spike.

744
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,600
Peyton?

745
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,700
Peyton! Peyton!

746
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,500
Peyton!

747
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,500
I'm not going to yell.

748
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,600
We're going to have a very calm

749
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,300
And rational discussion

750
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,300
about all...

751
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:39,900
You Bedazzled my football.

752
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,700
You guys comfortable? My pillow.

753
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:07,700
King on the couch!

754
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,000
This is ridiculous.

755
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,100
Never

756
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,700
say...

757
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,800
No! No!

758
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,500
I have to warm up.

759
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,100
I have to practice.

760
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,300
I have a playoff game this weekend.

761
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:40,000
Do you...
Do you know what that means?

762
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:45,300
My guess is that it means
you have a playoff game this weekend.

763
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:51,200
My dog, my bed, my car, my TV,
my stereo...

764
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,900
Is nothing sacred?

765
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:59,000
My towel! My towel.

766
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:02,200
This is all mine! It's all me!

767
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:05,400
It's all mine! This is all me!
This is my towel.

768
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:08,400
<i>Hi, everybody, I'm Marv Albert,
along with Boomer Esiason.</i>

769
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:12,200
<i>We're here in the Mile High City
where Denver hosts Boston</i>

770
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,500
<i>in the first round of the playoffs.</i>

771
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,600
In what should be
a tremendous showdown.

772
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:18,900
<i>We have a rematch
of last year's Conference Final</i>

773
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,500
<i>in which Denver narrowly escaped
with a 34-30 victory.</i>

774
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,200
<i>He has the tight end screen,
he side-arms it.</i>

775
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:27,100
<i>The catch made by Cooper.</i>

776
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,800
<i>Cooper on the run, picks up a blocker.</i>

777
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,300
<i>And now, directing traffic...</i>

778
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:36,200
<i>Nice cut. Cooper down the sideline!</i>

779
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:37,600
<i>And he's bounced out of bounds!</i>

780
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,600
Yeah! I did it again!

781
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,500
Oh, our boy looks great today.

782
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,900
He's going to look even greater
lounging poolside

783
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,100
at the new Blake resort.

784
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:49,600
Let's just see how many Fanny's
kiddie meals he sells first.

785
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,300
Fanny.

786
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:57,200
Do you work at Fanny's Burgers?

787
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:59,800
I own Fanny's Burgers, honey.

788
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:00,900
My mom says...

789
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:09,500
I mean, my dad says
your chili cheese fries rock.

790
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:12,900
Yeah, they do! They rock. Come on!
Kick it!

791
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,800
<i>Kingman out of the gun,
takes a look.</i>

792
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:20,700
<i>He has Sanders wide open.
He's not going that way.</i>

793
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,400
<i>Marv, I've never
seen a quarterback</i>

794
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,100
<i>who doesn't trust his wide receivers</i>

795
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,600
<i>with a game on the line like this.</i>

796
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:27,600
<i>Touchdown! It's all over!</i>

797
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,800
<i>Boston has defeated Denver.</i>

798
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:30,900
<i>All on the legs of Joe Kingman,</i>

799
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:34,800
Boston advances
to next week's divisional playoffs

800
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:36,000
for the second year in a row.

801
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:39,000
Now, will this be the year the King
takes them all the way?

802
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,700
Peyton, are you okay?
Why are you still here?

803
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,900
I guess Joe's running a little bit late
from practice.

804
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,400
What, two hours late?
That's unacceptable.

805
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,100
Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

806
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:01,800
Hey, King.

807
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
No, I'm the king. You're the king.

808
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:06,100
Don't do it, Elvis!
Don't jump.

809
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,100
Mr. Kingman?

810
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,000
Oh, no. Peyton.

811
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,400
Hey.

812
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:18,500
Yeah, I guess practice ran a little
longer than expected. Thanks, Bo.

813
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,700
- Mr. Kingman, we need to talk about...
- You know what?

814
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,600
Why don't you just call me Joe?

815
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:26,400
Stop it. Stop it.

816
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,600
Mr. Kingman,
I informed you from the start

817
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:32,000
that we are a ballet school,
not a daycare center.

818
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:34,400
Yeah! I got that. Mental note.

819
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:38,400
I'm glad you told me. Now I know.
Ballet school, not a daycare facility.

820
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,500
Sure, let me hook you up
for your time, though.

821
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:44,300
Peyton, go grab a hundo out of my bag.
It's in my wallet, around the corner.

822
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,000
I just knew
you were one of those parents.

823
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,100
One of what parents?

824
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:56,400
The kind who thinks that his life is
more important than anybody else's.

825
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:59,000
Look, lady.
I don't know what kind of parent I am.

826
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:01,000
All I know is I have an entire team...

827
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:04,300
Scratch that,
an entire city depending on me.

828
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,700
Yeah, you also have a daughter
depending on you

829
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,500
not to only take care of her,
but to care about her. Okay?

830
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,000
- Listen, I care about Peyton.
- Then prove it!

831
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:15,500
- I got it.
- Hey, sweetie!

832
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,300
Your father here was telling me
how excited he is

833
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:20,900
to finally fulfill the commitment
he made to support the school.

834
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,900
And guess what?
I've got the perfect job for him.

835
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Cool.

836
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:28,300
No, no, no. Absolutely not.
You're completely insane.

837
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:32,300
You're a freakishly large man

838
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,800
and you're telling me you're incapable
of playing a tree? Come on.

839
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:38,400
No, what I'm telling you is
I am a serious athlete.

840
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,000
Not a ballerina.

841
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,700
<i>You do me a favor, mamita?
Can you please hold this for me?</i>

842
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,700
Thank you so much.

843
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:47,000
Trust me, no one is ever going to
confuse you with a ballerina, okay?

844
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:49,800
And now,
I need you to be an enchanted tree...

845
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,700
I'm not going to be an enchanted tree.
I'm a quarterback!

846
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,600
I'm the only one that talks.

847
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:21,100
Up!

848
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,200
...around and... Oh, my God, no, no...
Please, come over here.

849
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,900
Wasn't so bad.

850
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,300
We're just warming up, so come on.

851
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:54,700
Hey, so what were you saying about
ballet not being a real sport?

852
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,500
Hmm?

853
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:00,300
It wasn't... It wasn't so bad.

854
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,900
You see, ballerinas can leap
as high as you can,

855
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,500
but when they go down,
they go down in plié.

856
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,700
And they hold and hold.

857
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:12,500
And then they go en pointe
for hours and hours.

858
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:16,200
So, if ballet were easy,
they'd call it football.

859
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,200
Yeah. Right.

860
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:22,700
Yeah, right.

861
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:25,200
Listen, Mr. Kingman,

862
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:28,100
your daughter has all the makings
to be a professional dancer.

863
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:31,100
She has passion, talent, discipline.

864
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:36,900
I guess she inherited more
than just your charm.

865
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:42,900
You see?

866
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,000
Let's try that one again.

867
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:55,300
Where were you last night?
You missed a great fight.

868
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,800
Hey, man,
you look like you were in a fight.

869
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:59,000
I was doing some stuff.

870
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,900
Well, you could've called.
You never call anymore.

871
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,200
Dude, stop being such a chick.

872
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,200
Never thought someone so little
could be so much work, huh?

873
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,800
You don't know the half of it.

874
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,500
<i>- Hello?
Hi!</i>

875
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:24,700
Listen, I finally got to a phone.
I want you to tell me everything.

876
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,500
I don't know where to start.

877
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,600
How about those pictures
you promised me?

878
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,500
E- mail me right now.

879
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:31,700
I have to see you.

880
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,100
Okay, hold on.

881
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,600
I just sent them.

882
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,300
You're breaking up. I love you.

883
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,000
Wait, wait. No, no, Peyton! Honey...

884
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,600
I love you, too.

885
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:52,100
We need to talk. Follow me.

886
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,100
I need my bed back.

887
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:08,200
Wow! That is awesome! I love it!

888
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:13,500
Love it. I love this room.
This is awesome.

889
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:18,900
It's beautiful.

890
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:22,300
- Thanks, Joe.
- You're welcome.

891
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:28,600
Look, P, you know the whole
"playbook for the house" thing?

892
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:31,000
No more buttonhooks in the kitchen.

893
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:32,800
Right. No more buttonhooks.

894
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:35,600
You see, the quarterback
is supposed to know the playbook

895
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:37,200
better than anybody.

896
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:42,400
But you and I,
you've been playing kid your entire life.

897
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,100
I just joined the dad team,
and I'm still learning all these plays.

898
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:47,500
No kidding.

899
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,300
All right.

900
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,100
Listen, sometimes a quarterback
has got to think on his feet

901
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,800
and call an audible, okay? And...

902
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,200
Here, this.

903
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,100
When the linebackers
are creeping up to blitz

904
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,800
And all of a sudden
you've got to call an audible

905
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,900
to change the play,
and you go around and you score!

906
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,600
He scores.

907
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:18,100
All right, it's kind of like, just like in life.

908
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:21,500
Sometimes things
get thrown at you unexpectedly.

909
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,900
Then you got to call an audible.

910
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
You got to learn on the go.

911
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:31,600
- Just like us. Okay?
- Okay.

912
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:39,200
<i>Number one on the field,
and number one in your heart.</i>

913
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:42,000
<i>- Now, number one on your toothbrush.
- That's funny.</i>

914
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:43,900
My teeth are really white.

915
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Ding!

916
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,600
That's ridiculous.

917
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:50,100
No, that's not. That's awesome.

918
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,800
- Joe?
- Yeah?

919
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:02,000
What's the best thing
that's ever happened to you?

920
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:07,600
Well, I...

921
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,400
<i>You have one incoming message.</i>

922
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:14,100
Hold that question, all right?

923
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:18,700
<i>This is the King. Do your thing.</i>

924
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,500
<i>Hey, baby, it's Tatianna.
I'm in Boston. I be there 6:00.</i>

925
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:26,800
Tatianna!

926
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:31,900
Tatianna's coming at 6:00.
I got plenty of time! It's 5:45!

927
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,800
Who's Tatianna?

928
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,200
I got 15 minutes.

929
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,700
- Who's Tatianna?
- 5:45. 5:45. 5:45.

930
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:44,700
Listen, she's a friend.
I'm gonna need you to clean up all this.

931
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:48,700
Take all this, take it down, and...
Hide it in your room.

932
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:49,800
And you go, too.

933
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:52,800
And you play hide-and-seek with that,
and just make sure they're all gone.

934
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,100
Is Tatianna your girlfriend?

935
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:07,800
Do you mind?

936
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,700
No, no, no, no, maybe, yes.

937
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:29,900
Hi, you must be Melanie.
Joe has told me so much about you!

938
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,800
- I'm Tatianna. What are you?
- Peyton. Joe's daughter.

939
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:35,500
Joe's daughter?

940
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:36,700
Mmm-hmm.

941
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:40,100
- How old are you anyway, four?
- How old are you, 40?

942
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:44,000
- I'm 21.
- Are you Joe's long-lost daughter, too?

943
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:45,100
Joe!

944
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:49,500
<i>Bonsoir, Tatianna.
Baby, welcome back!</i>

945
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:53,100
<i>You look très... Gorgeous!</i>

946
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:56,900
- I know.
- I see you've already met...

947
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:00,900
Peyton.

948
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Peyton, yes.
I don't know what she's told you.

949
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,300
'Cause she has
such a wild imagination.

950
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,800
Either way,
we have a lot to discuss over dinner.

951
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:11,200
Where are we eating?

952
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:14,300
You are going to eat
over at the Jensens', across the hall.

953
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:18,600
It's just like a restaurant over there.
Only not so much.

954
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:24,500
We going to miss you
at dinner tonight.

955
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:29,700
It was a shock at first,
but nothing's changed.

956
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,500
Nothing's changed.

957
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,200
Is your coat Bedazzled?

958
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:39,900
Peyton.

959
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,400
Wait a minute.

960
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:45,100
I'm still Joe.

961
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,300
Still the king.

962
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,200
You drive station wagon.

963
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:56,500
What? A station wagon?
That's not my car.

964
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:59,600
Somebody's fired.
I'm Joe Kingman and somebody's fired.

965
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:05,700
- Mr. Kingman, wait! Mr. Kingman.
- What?

966
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:09,200
I'm sorry, but I guess Peyton's
allergic to our dog.

967
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:13,000
Oh, she's allergic to the dog.
She's allergic to the dog.

968
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:15,600
Oh, really?
Well you're not allergic to Spike.

969
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:18,700
Excuse me.

970
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:24,100
- Bed. Now.
- I'm not even tired.

971
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:27,200
- Well, I am. Go to bed.
- To think you walked out on my mom

972
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:29,900
just to hang around
with the sorry likes of that.

973
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,800
What did you just say?

974
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:33,800
- To think you walked out...
- I didn't walk out on your mom.

975
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,400
She walked out on me.

976
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:36,900
Oh, really?

977
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,200
Because she said
you were self-centered. And selfish.

978
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:43,200
And that everything
always had to be about you.

979
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:45,000
She said your head was so swollen,

980
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:48,600
she was surprised
they made a helmet big enough to fit.

981
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:51,300
- She said that?
- And more.

982
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,400
You know, it's all coming back to me.

983
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:58,400
Of course. Everything.

984
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:02,000
All the talking and the arguing
and the complaining.

985
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:04,800
And you know what?
You're just like her!

986
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:06,000
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

987
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:07,900
You think you're right about everything!

988
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,400
- Just like her!
- What else?

989
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:13,800
You scrunch your nose
when you get angry just like her!

990
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:15,100
Keep it coming.

991
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:19,000
You're always working on me
with those big brown eyes...

992
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,800
Well, I actually like that, it's really cute.

993
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:24,800
But it doesn't matter,
because it's just like her!

994
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:25,900
Is that all you got?

995
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,800
And then you get inside
people's minds,

996
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:29,700
and you drive them crazy!

997
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,000
Just like her!

998
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:36,100
Well, at least I got a mind,
because if I didn't, I'd be just like you!

999
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:40,400
Well, I'm lucky, because as far as
I'm concerned, you are nothing like me!

1000
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:44,800
- Good! Because I am sick of it here.
- What do you want from me?

1001
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:50,900
Don't turn your back on me, little lady.
Tell me what you want!

1002
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,300
My mom!

1003
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,700
Hey, open the door.

1004
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Thanks a lot, Spike.

1005
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:28,200
Traitor.

1006
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:38,400
Any advice?

1007
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:44,200
<i>Are you lonesome tonight</i>

1008
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:48,900
<i>Do you miss me tonight</i>

1009
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:55,900
<i>Are you sorry we drifted apart</i>

1010
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:03,400
<i>Does your memory stray</i>

1011
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:07,500
<i>To a bright sunny day</i>

1012
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:10,000
<i>When I kissed you</i>

1013
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:14,800
<i>and called you sweetheart</i>

1014
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:22,100
<i>I wonder why I am</i>

1015
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:26,600
<i>Singing this for</i>

1016
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:31,100
<i>When you will not even</i>

1017
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:35,900
<i>Open the door</i>

1018
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,700
I don't want to see you.

1019
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:42,100
Well, how about you open the door
with your eyes closed?

1020
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:49,000
See, that wasn't so bad.

1021
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:54,300
<i>Is your heart filled with pain</i>

1022
01:04:55,100 --> 01:05:00,000
<i>Shall I come back again</i>

1023
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:02,400
<i>Tell me dear</i>

1024
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:07,100
<i>Are you lonesome tonight</i>

1025
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:14,800
<i>Won't you open your eyes</i>

1026
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:19,700
<i>Give your dad a surprise</i>

1027
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:23,100
<i>Tell me Peyton</i>

1028
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:29,400
<i>Are you lonesome tonight</i>

1029
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:34,400
There they are. Big and brown.

1030
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:37,100
Do I really have my mommy's eyes?

1031
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:40,300
Yeah. You bet.

1032
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:44,100
You also have
her crazy long eyelashes, too.

1033
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:49,000
And every time you bat those things,
there's a huge hurricane in Hawaii.

1034
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,600
See, look at that.
Three houses just blew away on Oahu.

1035
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:55,400
It's on the news.

1036
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:59,300
My mom said she fell in love with you
because of your guitar playing.

1037
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,900
That you sounded just like Elvis.

1038
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,800
- Well, what do you think?
- I think she was tone-deaf

1039
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:09,000
and you sound more like
a wounded moose than the King.

1040
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:10,300
A wounded moose?

1041
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,500
Mmm-hmm.

1042
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:12,600
Like...

1043
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,300
Like that?

1044
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:20,300
There's that smile
I've been waiting for.

1045
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:25,000
I would do anything to
keep that beautiful smile on your face.

1046
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,700
Anything?

1047
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:31,700
Quiet!

1048
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:34,000
Quiet! I said quiet!

1049
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:35,300
Let's go!

1050
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:38,600
Everybody, I need a tight
formation, right now, in front.

1051
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:41,000
Tight formation, everybody.
Calling an audible.

1052
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:42,600
Fifty-nine razor. What would...

1053
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:45,600
I am serious! Everybody huddle up...

1054
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:49,600
Little girls don't speak "football," Joe.

1055
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:51,200
Hey, I didn't say break.

1056
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:52,600
You call your dad Joe?

1057
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:53,700
Hmm.

1058
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,100
Come here.
What am I, two feet tall? Peyton!

1059
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:02,600
Watch out!
Watch my legs, I got million-dollar legs.

1060
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:04,900
What's that number?

1061
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,900
Get out of here! You're in my way!

1062
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:12,100
My legs! I got to play on Sunday.
Hello? I need help. I need help!

1063
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:16,600
Get off me! Everybody off...
Me first! Me first!

1064
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:22,200
Excuse me.
- I'm world-famous. I'm a celebrity.

1065
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:34,800
Maybe a smidgen of the cream.

1066
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:39,900
Very good tea.
Would you like a little bit of tea?

1067
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:51,500
- Thank you for saving me.
- You're welcome.

1068
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:55,700
Totally out of my league.
Only mothers can do this stuff.

1069
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:57,000
Not necessarily.

1070
01:07:57,100 --> 01:08:00,200
I mean, it's true
that mothers are definitely smarter

1071
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:02,300
and kinder and funnier,

1072
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,900
and for the most part
better at everything.

1073
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,200
But can I tell you something?

1074
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:10,200
I wouldn't underestimate
the power of the father.

1075
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:13,200
- The power of the father.
- Sure.

1076
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:16,700
Dads are great for picking you up
and dusting you off.

1077
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:17,400
They give you the courage to do things

1078
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:18,100
They give you the courage to do things

1079
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:20,100
that you never thought you could.

1080
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:23,100
My father took me
to my first ballet class.

1081
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:26,600
Lucky for us he did.

1082
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:34,600
What?

1083
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:36,200
Nothing.

1084
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,300
Do we have any product for this?

1085
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:42,200
My doll has hair plugs for some reason.

1086
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:46,000
Joe, they've got Camille
fingernail polish!

1087
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:47,800
- No way.
- Way!

1088
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,900
Nice shade. What is that?
Powder-puff pink?

1089
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:55,400
I got a question. Do your toes match?

1090
01:08:56,700 --> 01:09:00,900
Hey. Hey, relax. Relax. Cut it out.
He can't help it.

1091
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,100
Somebody stole his man card.

1092
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:08,800
All right, all right, all
right, all right. Listen up.

1093
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:12,900
Indianapolis claims that they're
going to send us on a long vacation.

1094
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,400
- But who's about to go fishing?
- They are!

1095
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,600
- Who's about to hit the links?
- They are!

1096
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:20,800
- Who's going to win the championship?
- They are!

1097
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:24,500
- We are?
- We are!

1098
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,100
- Ready!
- Break!

1099
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:44,000
Your turn, little one.

1100
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:58,100
I can't do it. I'm not big enough.
My shoulders aren't strong enough.

1101
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:04,000
Little one. You can do it.
Your strength is in here.

1102
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,500
- Are you ready?
- Okay.

1103
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:08,100
Let's do it.

1104
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,900
- There you go. You're doing it.
- Yeah, it's moving.

1105
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,100
Hey, Joe.

1106
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:20,800
Attaway, P.

1107
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:27,900
And one. Higher.
Point those toes, please.

1108
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:31,000
Everybody together. Much better.

1109
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:33,400
No, no, no, no, no, no...

1110
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:36,300
Instinct.

1111
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:39,200
And a three. And one...

1112
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:40,300
And...

1113
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:44,900
Hey. You've got my time, cutie-pie.
Yeah...

1114
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,700
<i>Boston Rebels. Catch the spirit.</i>

1115
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:04,100
Hey, Peyton. Come here.
You are so busted! Get over here!

1116
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:07,500
- Hey...
- Get him!

1117
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:08,700
Fire!

1118
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,300
- Fire!
- Fire!

1119
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:21,200
Good one.

1120
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:03,300
Boston beats Indianapolis.

1121
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:06,200
The Rebels will advance on
to next Sunday's conference finals...

1122
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:09,700
Look at this. Look at this.
Artwork in the locker, huh?

1123
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:13,800
I definitely say
she's breached the final frontier.

1124
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:15,200
That's our game plan.

1125
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:17,400
See, I especially like the Xs and Os
down there.

1126
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,800
Oh, no, those are hugs and kisses.

1127
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,900
Hugs and kisses. All right. All right.

1128
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:30,100
Is Spike wearing a tutu?

1129
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:32,800
No, no.

1130
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:37,800
No, that's one of those...
That's one of those doggy supports.

1131
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:44,100
Hey, P. P! Hey, P.

1132
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:46,900
Give these to Monique, okay?
There she is.

1133
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:47,900
You good?

1134
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:50,200
Miss Monique. These are for you.

1135
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:55,800
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1136
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:58,300
- Are you ready for your big debut?
- Yeah.

1137
01:12:58,400 --> 01:12:59,700
- There you go, P.
- Thank you.

1138
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:02,500
No, no, no. Joe. Joe, this is for you.

1139
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:11,500
No. No, in case you forgot,
I'm a "freakishly" large man

1140
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,700
and these are "freakishly" small tights.

1141
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:16,200
Hurry up, offense. No huddle.

1142
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:17,700
- Hey, guys.
Let's go.

1143
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:19,900
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

1144
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,000
- Please. Get dressed.
- No, listen to me. There's no...

1145
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,500
How's it going?

1146
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:32,800
Full house.

1147
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:34,900
- Oh, no.
- Hey.

1148
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:39,100
You know, Joe, I'm not feeling so good.

1149
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:42,700
We should just go home.
Yeah, let's go home.

1150
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:46,900
Did I just hear the girl who forced me
to learn pirouettes give up?

1151
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,400
But I didn't think there were
going to be so many people.

1152
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:53,000
You just have pre-game jitters,
that's all.

1153
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:55,000
All athletes have those.

1154
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:58,600
- Even me.
- You do?

1155
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:01,900
Come here, honey. Stand up.

1156
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,700
We've worked way too hard
to quit now.

1157
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,100
I know.

1158
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:16,700
All right, all right. All right.

1159
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:22,700
Listen, I don't care how ridiculous
either of us looks out there, okay?

1160
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:26,500
We're going to go out on the stage,
and we're going to dance our tutus off.

1161
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:29,700
- Because my daughter's no quitter.
- No, she's not.

1162
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:31,700
And she never says no.

1163
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:34,200
Okay.

1164
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:39,700
Excuse me, ma'am.
Have you seen Joe Kingman?

1165
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:43,900
Oh. Wait, no wait.

1166
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,600
That is the stupidest outfit
I've ever seen.

1167
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:50,900
Stupid is a mean word, Mr. Cooper.

1168
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:55,200
I didn't say "stupid. " I
said "stupidest. " Look it up.

1169
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:57,800
Hey, Sanders.
What are you guys doing here?

1170
01:14:57,900 --> 01:15:00,000
What are we doing here?

1171
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:03,600
Joe, did you really think the team
was going to miss this?

1172
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:08,500
Yeah, you should've said no, Joe.
You should've said no.

1173
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:11,000
Did you say "team"?

1174
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:12,600
Hmm.

1175
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:15,800
Joe.

1176
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:20,000
- P.
- Monroe.

1177
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:21,100
Bye.

1178
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:23,400
Did you say "team"? Or...

1179
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,900
Don't panic. No panic.

1180
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:34,800
Power of the father.
Power of the father.

1181
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:36,000
Power of the... You're panicking.

1182
01:16:57,700 --> 01:16:58,900
- Wow.
- Look at that one.

1183
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:02,900
Wow. That's incredible.

1184
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:31,100
So

1185
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:33,200
beautiful.

1186
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:38,300
- Bravo! Bravo!
- Bravo! Bravo!

1187
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:48,200
Little one!

1188
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:04,700
<i>Well, Boomer,
after their impressive victory today</i>

1189
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:07,600
<i>Joe Kingman and all of Boston
will finally get the chance</i>

1190
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:11,400
<i>at that coveted trophy, which has
eluded them for all these years.</i>

1191
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:12,800
Aw, there's my number-one
quarterback.

1192
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:16,100
We did it! We're going!

1193
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:18,000
You may be the world's
greatest football player,

1194
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:19,600
but I'm the world's greatest agent.

1195
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:20,900
What's up?

1196
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,800
We're about to make
Tiger's endorsements

1197
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:25,000
look like minimum wage.

1198
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:29,300
All you have to do is,
A, win the championship game...

1199
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:30,400
Details.

1200
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:34,200
B, right after you win,
look straight into the camera

1201
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:37,700
and say,
"I'm going to Fanny's Burgers. "

1202
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:42,700
- That's it. An instant 25 million.
- Hamburger.

1203
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:47,800
Stella, for the record, Fanny's
makes kids fat and gives them gas.

1204
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:51,100
Zip it before I tie another one of
those things around your mouth.

1205
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:53,200
"I'm going to Fanny's Burgers. "

1206
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:56,000
Twenty-five million. Done.

1207
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:00,800
I'm going to Fanny's Burgers.

1208
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:03,900
Two and one to the front.
Get ready...

1209
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:07,700
Spike, what are you doing?

1210
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:12,400
Oh, my God. I'm sorry, guys. I didn't...

1211
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:20,300
"Please be our lunch date.
X- O-X-O, Peyton and Joe. "

1212
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:23,600
- Hi!
- Hey!

1213
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:26,300
Okay. Thank you.

1214
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:27,900
You were freakishly large.

1215
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,000
I agree.

1216
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,200
No, I'm not. Don't say that.

1217
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:33,600
- You guys good?
There's the guy right there.

1218
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:34,800
What did I tell you?

1219
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:36,600
I agree that you are freakishly large.

1220
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:38,100
That's not funny.

1221
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:40,900
Hey, Joe! Joe, man!

1222
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:42,900
Number one.

1223
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,300
- Joe, Joe, Joe...
- Joe, Joe, Joe...

1224
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:47,100
- Is it always like this?
- Nah.

1225
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:48,900
What, you have a big game
coming up?

1226
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,700
- Yeah, the championship.
- That's exciting.

1227
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:54,600
Eight years old and already going to
big events like that, huh? I like it.

1228
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:58,000
Yeah, unfortunately Peyton's
going to be home by then.

1229
01:20:58,100 --> 01:21:00,100
Her mom gets back from Africa
in a few days.

1230
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:01,800
Well, can't you just go home
after the game?

1231
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:05,400
No, I have to get back before she does.

1232
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:07,100
What did you say?

1233
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:10,400
You said you'd have to get back
before she does?

1234
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:11,500
Mmm?

1235
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:13,100
Isn't your mom picking you up?

1236
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:16,200
- Well...
- Peyton.

1237
01:21:16,300 --> 01:21:19,600
I was planning to tell you, Joe.
I really was, but...

1238
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:22,700
Actually, it's a really funny story.
You're going to love it.

1239
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,100
- It's just LOL...
- Quit stalling.

1240
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:28,200
I'm supposed to be studying
at a special ballet program this month

1241
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:30,800
but instead,
I snuck away to come meet you.

1242
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:33,700
You ran away?

1243
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:36,700
You ran away?

1244
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:40,100
- Yummy dessert.
- Is your mom even in Africa?

1245
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:42,900
- About that...
- What have you done?

1246
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,800
Okay, I'm sure there's a reasonable
explanation and everybody...

1247
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:47,700
The press is going to eat me alive.

1248
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:50,900
What a stupid, stupid, stupid thing
for you to do.

1249
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:53,500
Did you ever stop and think about
how this was going to impact me?

1250
01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:56,100
Oh, stop it.
That's not going to work this time.

1251
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:57,300
You're in serious trouble.

1252
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:58,600
Okay, she's sweating like crazy.
She's coughing. Her lips are swelling.

1253
01:21:58,600 --> 01:21:59,900
Okay, she's sweating like crazy.
She's coughing. Her lips are swelling.

1254
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,800
Oh, come on. Don't fall for that.
She's a little world-class performer.

1255
01:22:02,900 --> 01:22:05,200
I don't think she's acting right now.
Give me one second.

1256
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:07,900
- Are you allergic to something?
- Nuts.

1257
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,700
Did you know that?

1258
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:13,300
The dessert has nuts.
Take her to the hospital. Come on.

1259
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:16,000
Hospital. Where's the nearest hospital?

1260
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:18,200
Ninth and Woodrow. I'll get the car.

1261
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,900
Where you going?
What are you doing?

1262
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:24,700
Move, move! Move!

1263
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:26,100
Excuse me, sir.

1264
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:43,400
Help! My daughter needs help! Help!

1265
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:46,000
What do we got here?
- Help. She's allergic.

1266
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:48,900
She can't breathe.
She's allergic to nuts.

1267
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Looks like an anaphylactic reaction.
Set her down.

1268
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:54,600
- She can't breathe.
- Baby. Baby, open up your mouth.

1269
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:57,600
Airway's almost closed. Let's move her.

1270
01:22:57,700 --> 01:23:00,000
- Ten liters non-rebreather mask.
- Peyton. Peyton.

1271
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:02,800
I'll show you to the family waiting room.

1272
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:04,800
It's going to be fine.
They're going to take good care of her.

1273
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:06,100
She'll be okay.

1274
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:10,700
Peyton Kelly's father?

1275
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,200
I'm Peyton's dad.

1276
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:18,900
Your daughter is responding well
to the treatment.

1277
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,100
We're going to keep her overnight
just to be sure,

1278
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:22,700
but she's going to be fine.

1279
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:28,700
- Thank you so much. Thank you.
- You were really, really lucky this time.

1280
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:35,200
- She's going to be all right.
- Yeah.

1281
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:37,000
Okay.

1282
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:42,400
Please tell me
Peyton's all right.

1283
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:44,300
She's going to be...

1284
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:50,900
She's going to be fine. The doctor says
that she's going to be fine.

1285
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:54,400
You're lucky I haven't called the police.

1286
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:57,700
- Karen?
- I got home early,

1287
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:59,300
and I see you and Peyton.

1288
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:02,900
Your faces plastered
on the front of every magazine.

1289
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,900
I called Peyton a hundred times
yesterday. She didn't answer.

1290
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:10,700
I flew out here, got off the plane,
and I see all of this on the news.

1291
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:12,600
Karen?

1292
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:16,000
Is that all you can say for yourself,
is "Karen"?

1293
01:24:16,100 --> 01:24:21,100
- I... I thought you were dead.
- I can assure you, I'm not dead.

1294
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,500
- How did you find her?
- I didn't. She found me.

1295
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:32,700
Wait a minute.
Is Peyton's mom still in Africa?

1296
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:42,300
She didn't tell you, did she?

1297
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:46,100
Joe,

1298
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:51,600
Sara died in a car accident
six months ago.

1299
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:03,800
Oh, Peyton.

1300
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:22,100
So when we got to Boston,
I put you into the car service.

1301
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:27,100
I sort of e-mailed
and changed the drop-off location.

1302
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:29,900
The driver took me to Joe's.

1303
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,800
Where does everybody
at your ballet school think you are?

1304
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:35,000
In Africa with you.

1305
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:39,800
The most important thing
is that you're okay.

1306
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:43,800
But we're going to discuss
everything else when we get home.

1307
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:45,800
- Home?
- Yes.

1308
01:25:45,900 --> 01:25:49,000
As soon as Peyton's strong enough,
we're going to go home.

1309
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:52,000
Hold on a sec. You can't come in here
and think she's going to go home...

1310
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:55,200
You know what? We're going to discuss
the travel plans a little later.

1311
01:25:55,300 --> 01:25:58,000
Right now,
Peyton needs to get some rest.

1312
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
I'm telling you.
It's terrible timing.

1313
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:05,800
It's absolutely terrible timing.
With the...

1314
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:07,400
I'm gonna go
get everybody some coffee.

1315
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:11,300
- Do you want some coffee?
- Double non-fat latte.

1316
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:13,200
Okay. Okay.

1317
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:35,300
Forget about timing.
I don't care about the game.

1318
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:37,000
I just care about her.

1319
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:41,800
All right. I understand.
But if you could just leave it to...

1320
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:43,700
- Can we talk?
- Yeah.

1321
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:49,500
She's asleep. It's okay.

1322
01:26:55,900 --> 01:26:56,900
Here.

1323
01:26:58,900 --> 01:27:00,400
We're all good.

1324
01:27:02,700 --> 01:27:04,800
Are you saying you want Peyton
to live here with you?

1325
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:08,400
- Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.
- You haven't even been in her life.

1326
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:11,600
That's not my fault.
I didn't even know she existed!

1327
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:13,200
And we've come such a long way
in a short time.

1328
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:16,300
What, you mean since a month ago
when you left her in a bar?

1329
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:18,300
I am not the same man that I was.

1330
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:21,400
Or an hour ago
when she almost died on your watch?

1331
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:24,900
This is not about you.

1332
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:28,700
This is about Peyton,
what's best for her.

1333
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:30,600
And she needs to be in a stable home

1334
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:32,500
with someone who's known her
her whole life.

1335
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:36,000
Peyton needs her father.
She needs me.

1336
01:27:36,100 --> 01:27:39,000
Of course. It'll be a huge distraction.

1337
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:44,400
And ugly.
Child custody fights always are.

1338
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:51,000
Joe will be dragged through the mud.
His endorsements torpedoed.

1339
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:53,800
He's worked too hard
to have it end like this.

1340
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,100
I just don't see him
getting through this.

1341
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:58,300
My hard work goes down the drain.

1342
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:00,800
This is exactly the sort of thing
that could end his career.

1343
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:04,500
That's not your decision to make.
Sara appointed me her guardian.

1344
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:09,100
I missed eight years of Peyton's life.
And I'm not going to miss any more.

1345
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:10,600
And I will fight for this.

1346
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:14,200
Oh, that would be a great thing
to put her through, don't you think?

1347
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:16,500
Do you have any idea
how to take care of a child?

1348
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:19,200
I've been doing it for a month now!

1349
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:21,800
And look where we're standing, Joe.

1350
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:34,500
Hey, P, you're awake.

1351
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:39,300
- How you feeling?
- I'm okay.

1352
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:43,100
- I want to go home.
- Okay.

1353
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:48,900
No problem. Doctor said
you could come home tomorrow.

1354
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,700
Then we can go home.

1355
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:55,400
I want to go home now
with Aunt Karen.

1356
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:03,400
P, if it's...
If it's what I said at the restaurant,

1357
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:05,800
honey, I didn't mean that.

1358
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:09,000
I just want to go home with Aunt Karen.

1359
01:29:09,100 --> 01:29:11,300
I never should've come here.

1360
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,600
Take care of her, will you?

1361
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:36,200
Hey, you know who
lives in this building?

1362
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:39,300
Joe Kingman, the quarterback.
How about that, huh?

1363
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:00,800
Come on, Spike.

1364
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:02,500
Spike.

1365
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:08,900
Spike, not tonight. Come on, Spike.

1366
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:13,400
Spike, there's nothing under there.
She's gone. Come on.

1367
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:16,300
Is that her bag?

1368
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:48,500
"What's the best thing
that's ever happened to you?"

1369
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:35,200
"Dear Joe, I have written
this letter a thousand times

1370
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:37,700
"but I could never find the right words.

1371
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:39,400
<i>- "We have a daughter. "
We have a daughter.</i>

1372
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:41,300
<i>- Her name is Peyton.
- "Her name is Peyton. "</i>

1373
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:46,600
<i>She's like you in so many ways,
athletic, headstrong...</i>

1374
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
<i>Hi, this is Peyton and Karen.</i>

1375
01:31:51,100 --> 01:31:52,700
<i>Leave us a message. Bye.</i>

1376
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:57,000
<i>I'm so afraid
you'll be angry with me</i>

1377
01:31:57,100 --> 01:31:59,700
<i>and not want anything to do with her.</i>

1378
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:03,600
<i>We had already decided
to go our separate ways.</i>

1379
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:08,400
<i>I rationalized that I was doing
the right thing in keeping her from you.</i>

1380
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:11,700
<i>You were just starting out
in your career.</i>

1381
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:14,700
<i>A child would have been
such a distraction.</i>

1382
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:23,200
Idiot.

1383
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:29,300
He's open, Joe. Sanders is wide open.

1384
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:45,400
<i>Hi, this is Peyton and Karen.</i>

1385
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:47,200
<i>Leave us a message. Bye.</i>

1386
01:32:47,700 --> 01:32:50,800
Hey, just calling to say that...

1387
01:32:54,100 --> 01:32:57,600
Spike, he misses you and...

1388
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:01,200
I mean, Spike really misses you, he...

1389
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,500
Sounds like someone else
misses her, too.

1390
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:12,200
Oh, hey.

1391
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:14,400
Sanders, I was just...

1392
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:16,200
I was talking to...

1393
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:21,700
Tell me what I'm supposed to do.

1394
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,200
Well, the only thing you can do

1395
01:33:25,300 --> 01:33:28,300
is make sure
that she knows you love her

1396
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:31,300
and that nothing's
ever going to change that.

1397
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:34,600
And then when she's ready,
she'll find you again.

1398
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:39,400
- You know, I owe you a big "thank you. "
- Oh yeah? For what?

1399
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:43,100
Just for catching everything
I've thrown at you all these years.

1400
01:33:44,300 --> 01:33:46,100
That's what friends are for.

1401
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:54,200
Hey, old man.
Are we ready to win the big game?

1402
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:56,900
Hold on a second, Joe.
Can we have a word with you?

1403
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,800
Word has it that your daughter
is no longer staying with you.

1404
01:33:59,900 --> 01:34:02,600
How much easier will it be for you
to focus on football

1405
01:34:02,700 --> 01:34:04,900
without the distraction
of an eight-year-old?

1406
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:08,000
<i>She's not a distraction.
She's my daughter.</i>

1407
01:34:08,100 --> 01:34:09,200
<i>I'd want her here with me</i>

1408
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:13,400
<i>even if it meant I'd never play
another football game again.</i>

1409
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:17,400
<i>There's nothing that I love more
than my daughter.</i>

1410
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:18,800
<i>Nothing.</i>

1411
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:46,200
<i>Here we are as the two biggest
rivals in football square off</i>

1412
01:34:46,300 --> 01:34:49,600
<i>for their chance
to etch their names in sports history.</i>

1413
01:34:49,700 --> 01:34:51,200
<i>You know,
and I think the question today, Marv,</i>

1414
01:34:51,300 --> 01:34:54,000
<i>is will Joe Kingman
finally get a chance at glory?</i>

1415
01:34:54,100 --> 01:34:57,400
<i>Or will New York win their third title
in the last four years?</i>

1416
01:34:57,500 --> 01:34:58,500
- Come on, let's go.
- Let's go, Joe.

1417
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:00,800
<i>Third and long
for the Rebels.</i>

1418
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:03,700
<i>Here's Kingman... Back to throw.</i>

1419
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:06,400
<i>Oh, he's drilled
by the linebacker, Drake.</i>

1420
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:08,900
<i>New York has recovered the fumble.</i>

1421
01:35:10,100 --> 01:35:12,500
<i>Boomer,
Kingman is way off his game today.</i>

1422
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:14,200
<i>This is not the same Boston team</i>

1423
01:35:14,300 --> 01:35:15,300
<i>we've seen march through
the playoffs.</i>

1424
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:17,000
<i>You know Marv, I can't explain this.</i>

1425
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:17,600
<i>You know Marv,
I can't explain this.</i>

1426
01:35:17,700 --> 01:35:19,800
<i>I mean,
he's missing wide-open receivers.</i>

1427
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:23,400
<i>He's been sacked four times, and he
looks like he's distracted to me.</i>

1428
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:26,200
So whatever that distraction is,
he's got to put it aside.

1429
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:29,000
<i>He owes it to his teammates
and the fans of the Boston team</i>

1430
01:35:29,100 --> 01:35:30,300
<i>to play it and lay it on the line.</i>

1431
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:32,700
Your guy's not looking so hot.

1432
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:37,700
How long has it been since you've had
one of your own Fanny's burgers?

1433
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:40,700
Mmm.

1434
01:35:42,100 --> 01:35:43,700
Too long, is my guess.

1435
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:49,600
Deflects right lead,
speed left squirrel. On one. Ready?

1436
01:35:50,900 --> 01:35:52,500
<i>The Rebels
trailing seven-three.</i>

1437
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:55,700
<i>Less than a minute remaining
in the first half.</i>

1438
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:57,400
<i>Kingman has his team at the line.</i>

1439
01:35:57,500 --> 01:36:01,100
<i>Cooper, wide right,
shifts back to tight end.</i>

1440
01:36:01,300 --> 01:36:04,200
<i>Signal's called, and here's Kingman.</i>

1441
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:05,600
Yes, go!

1442
01:36:05,700 --> 01:36:07,400
<i>Kingman on the run.</i>

1443
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:09,200
<i>He is crushed.</i>

1444
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:11,900
<i>"Crushed" is right, Marv.</i>

1445
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:15,300
<i>Drake, the linebacker for New York,
is having a whale of a football game.</i>

1446
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:16,800
<i>They are on a mission
to shut Kingman up.</i>

1447
01:36:18,100 --> 01:36:20,500
<i>Welcome to the championship game,
Kingman.</i>

1448
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:24,900
Who's the king now, Joe? I am!

1449
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,800
Come on, Joe! Get up, Joe!

1450
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:30,200
- Yeah, baby! Let's go!
- Get Danville.

1451
01:36:30,300 --> 01:36:32,900
<i>Hold on for a second, Marv.
Joe Kingman is still down.</i>

1452
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,900
<i>It looks like he was hit by a truck.</i>

1453
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,300
Believe me, I know. I've been there.

1454
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:38,600
This hit is not going to be easy
to come back from.

1455
01:36:38,700 --> 01:36:41,800
<i>So, Boomer, you never want to
speculate as to the extent of the injury.</i>

1456
01:36:41,900 --> 01:36:43,600
<i>They're being very careful,
as you can see,</i>

1457
01:36:43,700 --> 01:36:46,100
<i>lifting Joe Kingman onto that gurney.</i>

1458
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:47,800
<i>Well, they really can't evaluate him
on the field.</i>

1459
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:49,400
<i>They want to do that
in the locker room.</i>

1460
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:51,500
<i>Some way, Joe Kingman
is going to have to find a way</i>

1461
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:52,500
<i>to get back on this field.</i>

1462
01:36:52,700 --> 01:36:55,900
- Don't worry, he's tough.
- He better be.

1463
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:59,400
Oh, he is. Tough as nails.

1464
01:36:59,700 --> 01:37:02,500
<i>And there's the backup
quarterback, Danville, taking the knee,</i>

1465
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:04,300
<i>so that does it for the first half.</i>

1466
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:05,600
<i>This is not good
for the Rebels.</i>

1467
01:37:05,700 --> 01:37:08,700
<i>They have got to hope that Kingman
can find the strength to come back.</i>

1468
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:10,800
- All right, what's going on here?
- It doesn't look good, Coach.

1469
01:37:10,900 --> 01:37:14,300
He's got a separated shoulder,
bruised ribs. I think he's done.

1470
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:16,000
Joe, it's your call.

1471
01:37:16,100 --> 01:37:19,300
If you think you can handle it, then...

1472
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:20,700
What do you say?

1473
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,700
Put Danville in.

1474
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:35,600
That's the best thing for the team.

1475
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:37,800
<i>Can you believe this?</i>

1476
01:37:37,900 --> 01:37:41,200
<i>It looks like Danville, the backup
quarterback, is checking in.</i>

1477
01:37:41,300 --> 01:37:42,700
He hasn't played all season.

1478
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:45,300
Can you say,
"Nightmare scenario for Boston"?

1479
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:48,500
He's coming back out, right?
You know how important this deal is.

1480
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:53,600
Sam, baby. Not to worry.
Our Joe's not a quitter.

1481
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:05,400
Go, Boston.

1482
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,800
<i>So, it's all in the hands
of the backup quarterback, Danville.</i>

1483
01:38:09,900 --> 01:38:13,200
<i>And he's in trouble,
and down he goes.</i>

1484
01:38:13,300 --> 01:38:15,300
<i>Joe Kingman must be banged up
pretty bad.</i>

1485
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:16,800
<i>If not, he would never let Maddox</i>

1486
01:38:16,900 --> 01:38:18,600
<i>take him out
of the championship game.</i>

1487
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,400
Turn them off.

1488
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:25,100
I said turn them off!

1489
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:30,000
Hey, Joe. You got money
on New York or something?

1490
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:34,900
Peyton? Come here.

1491
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,500
It's okay.

1492
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:44,000
Please tell me
you're not on the lam again.

1493
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:46,900
No, this time she brought the warden
with her.

1494
01:38:48,100 --> 01:38:51,300
- What are you guys doing here?
- I called an audible.

1495
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:54,000
See, I thought you'd be better off
without me.

1496
01:38:55,900 --> 01:39:00,900
But judging by the butt-whupping
you got out there, I guess I was wrong.

1497
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:06,800
I love you, Daddy.
I want to come home.

1498
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:10,500
I love you too, Peyton.
I love you so much.

1499
01:39:12,300 --> 01:39:14,300
She needs her father.

1500
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:17,200
She needs you, Joe.

1501
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:21,900
Are you serious?

1502
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,600
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1503
01:39:25,700 --> 01:39:27,300
- Yeah.
- Come here!

1504
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:31,700
- Daddy, can't breathe.
- Joe, can't breathe.

1505
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:33,100
Me either.

1506
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:36,900
So, why aren't you out there playing?

1507
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,900
I thought the team
would be better off without me.

1508
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:43,100
I didn't come all this way
to see my dad sit out the big game.

1509
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:44,900
I'm really banged up, P.

1510
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,100
Did I just hear the King give up?

1511
01:39:47,700 --> 01:39:51,400
We've worked way too hard
for you to throw in the towel now.

1512
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:55,700
My dad's not a quitter.
And he never says no.

1513
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:15,200
I have an answer to your question, P.

1514
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:17,400
Win or lose today,

1515
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:20,700
you're the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

1516
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,000
<i>Marv, what is this?</i>

1517
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:47,900
<i>There's some sort of commotion
down by the tunnel.</i>

1518
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:50,500
Time! Time!

1519
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:54,500
<i>And it's Joe Kingman. He's come out!</i>

1520
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:56,500
<i>What a moment for Kingman,
his teammates,</i>

1521
01:40:56,600 --> 01:40:58,600
<i>and certainly Boston's fans.</i>

1522
01:40:58,700 --> 01:41:02,300
- Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe!
- Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe!

1523
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:05,400
All right. All right. Coach, your call.

1524
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:09,000
Your team.

1525
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:13,200
All right. Train red two.
Fifty win pass zebra. All right?

1526
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:18,000
Hey, hey, hey, come on! Nobody look
at the clock! Look at me! Look at me!

1527
01:41:18,100 --> 01:41:20,000
We got plenty of time,
and I'm going to tell you why.

1528
01:41:20,100 --> 01:41:24,100
You know why?
Because the Rebels never say "no. "

1529
01:41:24,200 --> 01:41:25,100
Break!

1530
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:28,500
Come on, Joe! Destroy them!

1531
01:41:29,300 --> 01:41:32,200
<i>With only a minute remaining,
Kingman would have to put together</i>

1532
01:41:32,300 --> 01:41:33,800
the drive of the century.

1533
01:41:33,900 --> 01:41:37,400
He'll have to march
the Rebels 65 yards.

1534
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:39,800
<i>Boomer, he has no timeouts remaining</i>

1535
01:41:39,900 --> 01:41:42,500
<i>and they need
a touchdown for the win.</i>

1536
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:45,300
Down set!

1537
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:47,600
<i>All right,
Kingman makes changes at the line.</i>

1538
01:41:48,900 --> 01:41:51,800
Go Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

1539
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:53,900
Back 88.

1540
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:57,100
Back 88!

1541
01:41:57,500 --> 01:41:59,400
Hut-hut! Hut!

1542
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:04,400
<i>Kingman. Back to throw.
He's forced out of the pocket.</i>

1543
01:42:05,500 --> 01:42:07,400
<i>And now flips it...</i>

1544
01:42:08,100 --> 01:42:09,600
<i>Webber with the catch!</i>

1545
01:42:10,300 --> 01:42:13,200
<i>But he cuts inside.
Does not go to the outside.</i>

1546
01:42:13,300 --> 01:42:15,100
<i>Can't get out of bounds
to stop the clock.</i>

1547
01:42:15,200 --> 01:42:16,600
<i>Webber needed
to get out of bounds.</i>

1548
01:42:16,700 --> 01:42:18,400
<i>He knows
that they don't have any timeouts left.</i>

1549
01:42:18,500 --> 01:42:21,200
<i>Now, it's up to Kingman to get
his team to the line of scrimmage</i>

1550
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:22,700
<i>and call a play quickly.</i>

1551
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:25,300
Black! Fifty-nine razor!

1552
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:26,400
Take Drake!

1553
01:42:26,500 --> 01:42:30,600
<i>Now second down with
24 seconds left from the Boston 44.</i>

1554
01:42:30,700 --> 01:42:32,100
<i>Out of the shotgun.</i>

1555
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:35,400
<i>Can't find anybody, he's on the run.</i>

1556
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:37,600
<i>There's the "Kingman Swing. "</i>

1557
01:42:38,300 --> 01:42:40,900
<i>Kingman with some fancy footwork.</i>

1558
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:44,000
<i>Fancy? The King looks
downright graceful all of a sudden.</i>

1559
01:42:44,100 --> 01:42:46,800
<i>He's to the 25... The 20...</i>

1560
01:42:46,900 --> 01:42:49,700
<i>He took a hard hit! Oh, man!</i>

1561
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:52,400
<i>Knocked out of bounds at the 17.</i>

1562
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:54,600
Come on, Joe. Get up. Get up, Joe!

1563
01:42:54,700 --> 01:42:57,200
<i>Can he get up, though?
That's the question.</i>

1564
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Yeah!

1565
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:07,000
<i>I'll tell you, Kingman
continues to show his toughness.</i>

1566
01:43:07,100 --> 01:43:09,500
<i>And, Marv, with four
seconds left to go in the game,</i>

1567
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:13,200
<i>I don't know a quarterback
who doesn't live for a moment like this.</i>

1568
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:16,900
Come on, guys. Come on, team.
Come on.

1569
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:19,500
Come on, Rebels!
You can do it!

1570
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:21,800
Come on, number one!

1571
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,200
Great block, Webber. Great block.

1572
01:43:24,300 --> 01:43:25,600
It has come down to this.

1573
01:43:25,700 --> 01:43:29,400
With time for one last play,
Kingman brings his team to the line.

1574
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:32,000
<i>Can he pull off yet another miracle?</i>

1575
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:35,000
<i>Marv, this is Joe Kingman's
moment. Can he deliver?</i>

1576
01:43:35,100 --> 01:43:36,800
<i>This is the stuff
that legends are made of.</i>

1577
01:43:36,900 --> 01:43:38,000
Come on, Daddy!

1578
01:43:39,300 --> 01:43:41,000
Check 52! 52!

1579
01:43:45,100 --> 01:43:47,000
I'm going to show you
who the real king is, Joe.

1580
01:43:47,100 --> 01:43:49,000
You about to get done lit up, son!

1581
01:43:49,100 --> 01:43:51,400
What? Are you stupid or something?

1582
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:54,000
"Stupid" is a mean word!

1583
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:56,000
Hut-hut! Hut!

1584
01:43:58,900 --> 01:44:00,700
Stay off my quarterback!

1585
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:04,100
In what could be
the final play of the season

1586
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:07,600
Kingman looking downfield.
He has Sanders.

1587
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:18,100
It is caught!

1588
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:22,300
Touchdown!
Boston has won the championship!

1589
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:41,100
Let's go watch my MVP
take your 25 million, shall we?

1590
01:44:41,900 --> 01:44:44,900
An incredible ending
to a magnificent career.

1591
01:44:45,100 --> 01:44:47,900
Joe Kingman, finally a champion.

1592
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:51,900
Okay, Joe. This is it.
"I'm going to Fanny's Burgers. "

1593
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,400
Hey, Joe Kingman,
you've just won the championship,

1594
01:44:54,500 --> 01:44:56,700
so what are you going to do now?

1595
01:44:59,900 --> 01:45:01,500
I'm going to take my daughter home.

1596
01:45:14,300 --> 01:45:16,600
Daddy, you won the championship.

1597
01:45:16,700 --> 01:45:19,600
Oh, Peyton,
I've won much more than that.

1598
01:45:27,400 --> 01:45:28,800
Yeah!

1599
01:48:18,100 --> 01:48:19,900
And cut!
