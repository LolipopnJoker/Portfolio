1
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:50,592
Tie it off, come on!

2
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:17,451
Hey, guys!
Guys, I think we should turn back.

3
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:19,686
And lose good money?
Not a chance.

4
00:01:19,688 --> 00:01:21,322
Stay close.

5
00:01:29,197 --> 00:01:30,399
Here we are.

6
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,100
Get on his back.

7
00:01:52,688 --> 00:01:53,689
Hurry up.

8
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:55,657
Whoa!

9
00:01:59,695 --> 00:02:01,329
Ow!

10
00:02:02,296 --> 00:02:03,430
Whoa!

11
00:02:06,234 --> 00:02:07,767
There he is.
Go get him.

12
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:09,337
Oh, you'll pay
for that.

13
00:03:06,595 --> 00:03:08,728
No. No, please.

14
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,666
Please, no.

15
00:03:33,455 --> 00:03:34,756
Hold it there.

16
00:03:52,808 --> 00:03:54,206
I only got one...

17
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,942
but he's a fine specimen.

18
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,684
- That's all?
- Yeah.

19
00:04:04,686 --> 00:04:06,419
That shroom bit me twice.

20
00:04:06,421 --> 00:04:07,589
Huh.

21
00:04:13,194 --> 00:04:15,897
Tomb Bloom.

22
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,886
<i>Once upon a time...</i>

23
00:04:39,888 --> 00:04:42,354
<i>or perhaps twice upon a time,</i>

24
00:04:42,356 --> 00:04:44,289
<i>for you may
remember this story...</i>

25
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:48,597
<i>there was a powerful Fey
named Maleficent.</i>

26
00:04:57,706 --> 00:05:00,006
<i>For some reason,
the mistress of evil</i>

27
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,675
<i>and protector of the Moors...</i>

28
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:04,844
<i>was still hated
after all this time.</i>

29
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,814
<i>True, she had cursed
the princess, Aurora...</i>

30
00:05:07,816 --> 00:05:09,916
<i>but that was before
she found light</i>

31
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:11,818
<i>in the heart
of a human child...</i>

32
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,754
<i>and raised the girl
as her own.</i>

33
00:05:14,756 --> 00:05:17,624
<i>After all,
it was Maleficent's love</i>

34
00:05:17,626 --> 00:05:20,694
<i>which broke
that very same curse.</i>

35
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:24,964
<i>But that detail was somehow
mysteriously forgotten.</i>

36
00:05:24,966 --> 00:05:27,266
<i>For as the tale was told</i>

37
00:05:27,268 --> 00:05:30,603
<i>over and again
throughout the kingdom...</i>

38
00:05:30,605 --> 00:05:34,609
<i>Maleficent became the villain
once more.</i>

39
00:05:46,988 --> 00:05:49,456
It's time, guys.
Come on. Let's get everyone.

40
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:50,590
It's the big day!

41
00:05:50,592 --> 00:05:51,725
- Come on.
- Let's go!

42
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:53,727
Wake up. Wake up.

43
00:05:54,796 --> 00:05:55,864
Come on.

44
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:10,677
Hurry up, wallerbogs!
It's time!

45
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,760
Do you both remember
the secret plan?

46
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:28,528
I've got it
all right here.

47
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,063
When do I tell the queen
the secret?

48
00:06:30,065 --> 00:06:31,865
You must be patient,
Thistlewit.

49
00:06:31,867 --> 00:06:33,733
Do you think Queen
Aurora's awake yet?

50
00:06:33,735 --> 00:06:36,936
Well, she's not
"Sleeping Beauty" anymore.

51
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,472
I see what you did there.

52
00:06:51,653 --> 00:06:55,021
Next item of business,
the missing fairies.

53
00:06:55,023 --> 00:06:56,523
I've sent more sprites

54
00:06:56,525 --> 00:06:58,625
to search
the Tomb Bloom field.

55
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:00,093
They'll report back to me
at nightfall.

56
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,497
We will keep searching
until we find them.

57
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,734
Please don't raise
your roots at me, Lief.

58
00:07:07,736 --> 00:07:10,872
Crushing humans with branches
is not going to help.

59
00:07:12,841 --> 00:07:15,141
Diaval, you're supposed to be
on my side.

60
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:21,047
Well, I'm Queen of the Moors,
and I am a human.

61
00:07:23,752 --> 00:07:27,387
We must all learn
a little kindness.

62
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:28,521
Coming through.

63
00:07:28,523 --> 00:07:29,956
Excuse us.

64
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,124
Official pixie business.

65
00:07:31,126 --> 00:07:32,559
A word,
Your Majesty.

66
00:07:32,561 --> 00:07:33,993
- Maybe two.
- Aunties...

67
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,429
you need to wait your turn
like everyone else.

68
00:07:36,431 --> 00:07:38,464
- No!
- This can't wait, Your Grace.

69
00:07:38,466 --> 00:07:39,799
Not for a moment.

70
00:07:39,801 --> 00:07:42,336
Or I might burst.
Truly, I might.

71
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,005
Is that...?

72
00:07:47,042 --> 00:07:48,608
Pinto!

73
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,043
She's come
bearing gifts.

74
00:07:50,045 --> 00:07:53,179
The first sap
from the warming trees.

75
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,148
It's for the big day!

76
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,716
Quiet, Thistlewit.

77
00:07:56,718 --> 00:07:58,551
What big day?

78
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,123
Hey! My crown!

79
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:09,564
I'm not in the mood for this.

80
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:12,366
Pinto!

81
00:08:12,767 --> 00:08:14,100
Whoa!

82
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:24,143
Come on.

83
00:08:24,145 --> 00:08:26,179
Where are you going,
aunties?

84
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,682
Whoa!

85
00:08:29,684 --> 00:08:31,853
I don't have time
for games, Pinto.

86
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,871
What's gotten
into all of you?

87
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,541
Oh. Uh-oh!

88
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,016
There she goes,
Your Majesty.

89
00:09:04,185 --> 00:09:05,954
Come back here.

90
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:15,597
Pinto. I've had enough
of your games for today.

91
00:09:15,964 --> 00:09:17,565
Look at me.

92
00:09:23,872 --> 00:09:25,038
Oh.

93
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,006
Philip.
What are you doing here?

94
00:09:27,008 --> 00:09:28,675
I was looking for you.

95
00:09:28,677 --> 00:09:30,643
- Oh, well, hello.
- Hello.

96
00:09:30,645 --> 00:09:32,879
I'm really sorry,
I can't talk right now.

97
00:09:32,881 --> 00:09:34,247
The Moors have turned
to madness.

98
00:09:34,249 --> 00:09:35,815
I've got a castle
full of complaints.

99
00:09:35,817 --> 00:09:37,850
- I know how busy you are.
- Oh!

100
00:09:37,852 --> 00:09:39,152
I wanted to
ask you something.

101
00:09:39,154 --> 00:09:40,219
Yes.

102
00:09:40,221 --> 00:09:41,821
Do you think there
could be a union

103
00:09:41,823 --> 00:09:43,491
between Ulstead
and the Moors?

104
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,092
A union?

105
00:09:46,094 --> 00:09:47,860
To connect both lands.

106
00:09:47,862 --> 00:09:50,263
To bring harmony
and peace.

107
00:09:50,265 --> 00:09:52,133
I've been imagining a bridge.

108
00:09:52,701 --> 00:09:54,069
Oh, a bridge.

109
00:09:54,869 --> 00:09:56,069
Yes, a bridge.

110
00:09:56,071 --> 00:09:58,571
A union's
a wonderful idea...

111
00:09:58,573 --> 00:10:00,475
if both sides are willing.

112
00:10:01,676 --> 00:10:04,610
Well, I'm working
on that part.

113
00:10:04,612 --> 00:10:06,079
He's going to blow it.

114
00:10:06,081 --> 00:10:07,148
Give him time.
He's warming up.

115
00:10:10,018 --> 00:10:11,252
Wait.

116
00:10:12,887 --> 00:10:14,756
That's your formal coat.

117
00:10:16,858 --> 00:10:19,625
You're in on all of this,
aren't you?

118
00:10:19,627 --> 00:10:21,094
If you're busy,
I could always come back.

119
00:10:21,096 --> 00:10:22,996
No. No, no.

120
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:24,297
I'm not busy at all.

121
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:25,865
No, because I'd hate to...

122
00:10:25,867 --> 00:10:27,233
Really. All ears.

123
00:10:27,235 --> 00:10:28,570
What did you
want to talk about?

124
00:10:30,038 --> 00:10:31,740
You're right.
He's blowing it.

125
00:10:33,308 --> 00:10:35,610
Five years ago,
I thought I lost you forever.

126
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:39,848
I've decided to reclaim
this day for us.

127
00:10:40,882 --> 00:10:42,582
I've loved you
since the moment I met you

128
00:10:42,584 --> 00:10:43,916
and every day since.

129
00:10:45,253 --> 00:10:47,320
If love has a truth,
here is mine.

130
00:10:47,322 --> 00:10:48,855
There is no magic
nor curse

131
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:51,092
that could ever tear me away
from you, Aurora.

132
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,362
Are you sure
this is a good time?

133
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,699
Oh, Philip.

134
00:11:00,101 --> 00:11:01,234
Oh, he's on his knee.

135
00:11:01,236 --> 00:11:02,704
He took his sweet
time about it.

136
00:11:04,005 --> 00:11:05,573
Will you marry me?

137
00:11:07,642 --> 00:11:08,908
Yes.

138
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,676
- Yes?
- Yes.

139
00:11:10,678 --> 00:11:13,815
Yes! Yes, just stand up.
Kiss me.

140
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:25,727
We're having a wedding!

141
00:11:27,796 --> 00:11:30,331
A secret surprise wedding.

142
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,937
Of course,
we have to tell our parents.

143
00:11:38,773 --> 00:11:40,073
Do we?

144
00:12:10,138 --> 00:12:11,737
Mistress.

145
00:12:11,739 --> 00:12:13,172
What?

146
00:12:13,174 --> 00:12:15,409
I have
a little bit of news.

147
00:12:15,411 --> 00:12:18,211
Well, on with it.

148
00:12:18,213 --> 00:12:20,179
It's nothing
of any real consequence...

149
00:12:20,181 --> 00:12:24,250
and it's certainly
no reason to overreact.

150
00:12:24,252 --> 00:12:25,887
It's just that...

151
00:12:26,888 --> 00:12:29,122
Prince Philip has, um...

152
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:30,723
Disappeared?

153
00:12:30,725 --> 00:12:33,726
No.
No. Philip has...

154
00:12:33,728 --> 00:12:35,063
Yellow fever?
No, wait!

155
00:12:36,231 --> 00:12:37,930
Leprosy!

156
00:12:37,932 --> 00:12:40,266
No, Mistress.

157
00:12:40,268 --> 00:12:43,202
Prince Philip has asked Aurora
if she'll become his...

158
00:12:43,204 --> 00:12:44,939
Don't...

159
00:12:45,441 --> 00:12:48,042
ruin my morning.

160
00:12:50,745 --> 00:12:51,946
Mistress, please.

161
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,885
Stay calm!

162
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,858
<i>So, tell me, sire...</i>

163
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,193
am I to be a best man,

164
00:13:07,195 --> 00:13:09,295
or did you choose a
creature from the Moors?

165
00:13:09,297 --> 00:13:10,229
General,
if that's your way

166
00:13:10,231 --> 00:13:13,032
of asking me if she said
yes, then I, uh...

167
00:13:13,034 --> 00:13:15,101
I know
she said yes, sire.

168
00:13:15,103 --> 00:13:17,837
What human wouldn't want
to leave that place?

169
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,439
What do you have against
Moor folk, Percival?

170
00:13:19,441 --> 00:13:22,275
"Moor folk"? Is that what
we're calling them now?

171
00:13:22,277 --> 00:13:24,277
Winged beasts,
murderous trees.

172
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:26,145
Guard your tongue,
General.

173
00:13:26,147 --> 00:13:27,447
You know nothing about them.

174
00:13:27,449 --> 00:13:29,416
I know that Maleficent
is a killer of men...

175
00:13:29,418 --> 00:13:33,021
destroyer of armies.
Or so the story goes.

176
00:13:34,122 --> 00:13:35,922
She's not like that.

177
00:13:35,924 --> 00:13:38,324
It's my job to protect
this kingdom.

178
00:13:38,326 --> 00:13:39,994
And I will do so,
old friend...

179
00:13:40,762 --> 00:13:42,398
without hesitation.

180
00:13:43,298 --> 00:13:45,099
Walk on.

181
00:13:49,471 --> 00:13:51,306
Open the gates!

182
00:14:01,015 --> 00:14:03,082
Your Majesty,
spoils from the annexation

183
00:14:03,084 --> 00:14:04,420
of the Midlands have arrived.

184
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,321
Weapons.

185
00:14:08,356 --> 00:14:10,392
No. We have no need of arms.

186
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:13,261
Our days of war are over.

187
00:14:16,465 --> 00:14:18,831
Ingrith...

188
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:21,033
you see where
I've had you placed.

189
00:14:21,035 --> 00:14:22,036
Right behind me.

190
00:14:23,371 --> 00:14:26,239
And that's
where I'll always be.

191
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:29,809
Ingrith, I said
we had no need of arms.

192
00:14:29,811 --> 00:14:32,046
One can never be too careful.

193
00:14:37,885 --> 00:14:40,152
Your Majesty, it's cocked.

194
00:14:40,154 --> 00:14:42,088
Is it, now?

195
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:49,262
- Father, Mother.
- Well?

196
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:50,331
What did she say?

197
00:14:51,065 --> 00:14:52,265
She said yes.

198
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:54,100
Yes!

199
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:57,069
That is wonderful news. Oh!

200
00:14:57,071 --> 00:14:59,839
Two kingdoms united
at last.

201
00:14:59,841 --> 00:15:00,842
Yes.

202
00:15:04,312 --> 00:15:05,381
Yes.

203
00:15:06,314 --> 00:15:08,314
Perhaps I've
been selfish...

204
00:15:08,316 --> 00:15:10,552
looking at this
the wrong way.

205
00:15:11,352 --> 00:15:14,287
You've made your choice.

206
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:15,921
Now is a time to celebrate.

207
00:15:20,496 --> 00:15:22,529
I'm glad
you finally approve.

208
00:15:22,531 --> 00:15:23,630
Much more than that.

209
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:28,402
I am ready to welcome
your fiancee with open arms.

210
00:15:30,204 --> 00:15:31,438
She shall come to dinner.

211
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,606
That would be incredible.

212
00:15:32,608 --> 00:15:34,408
Under one condition.

213
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,410
She will bring her godmother.

214
00:15:36,412 --> 00:15:37,577
Your Majesty, I strongly...

215
00:15:37,579 --> 00:15:39,979
We will meet the one
who raised her

216
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,548
right here in this castle.

217
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,082
Yes.
The queen is right.

218
00:15:43,084 --> 00:15:44,216
I'm not sure
her godmother will...

219
00:15:44,218 --> 00:15:46,052
No, but I insist.

220
00:15:46,054 --> 00:15:50,256
After all,
we will soon be family.

221
00:15:50,258 --> 00:15:52,892
Well, let it be known
throughout the kingdom...

222
00:15:52,894 --> 00:15:56,396
that my son
is to marry Aurora.

223
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:00,301
And Maleficent
is coming to dinner.

224
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,540
I shall send word
straightaway.

225
00:16:19,287 --> 00:16:20,288
Oh!

226
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,029
Incoming.

227
00:16:30,932 --> 00:16:33,469
Hold on to your petticoats!

228
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:46,582
Well, well.

229
00:16:49,385 --> 00:16:50,586
So?

230
00:16:51,387 --> 00:16:52,920
So.

231
00:16:56,525 --> 00:16:57,526
Godmother...

232
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,499
Philip asked me to marry him.

233
00:17:04,999 --> 00:17:06,232
Poor thing.

234
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,969
He'll recover.

235
00:17:09,605 --> 00:17:12,006
My answer was yes.

236
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:17,176
- No.
- Yes.

237
00:17:17,178 --> 00:17:18,310
No.

238
00:17:18,312 --> 00:17:19,579
I wasn't really asking.

239
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:20,649
Nor was I.

240
00:17:21,417 --> 00:17:23,015
What's next?

241
00:17:23,017 --> 00:17:24,553
You'll turn him into a goat?

242
00:17:25,654 --> 00:17:26,720
Hmm.

243
00:17:26,722 --> 00:17:29,121
Stop.

244
00:17:29,123 --> 00:17:31,223
Why don't you like Philip?

245
00:17:31,225 --> 00:17:33,225
Well, for one thing,
he's human.

246
00:17:33,227 --> 00:17:34,694
I'm a human.

247
00:17:34,696 --> 00:17:37,599
And I have never
held that against you.

248
00:17:38,467 --> 00:17:40,199
Until I fell in love.

249
00:17:40,201 --> 00:17:45,505
Love doesn't always
end well, Beasty.

250
00:17:45,507 --> 00:17:48,174
I'll have you know
Prince Philip is a prince.

251
00:17:48,176 --> 00:17:50,744
A very handsome
and charming prince.

252
00:17:54,716 --> 00:17:57,684
I'm just asking you
to trust me.

253
00:17:57,686 --> 00:17:59,753
Please give him a chance.

254
00:17:59,755 --> 00:18:01,588
Let us prove you wrong.

255
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,657
Philip is thoughtful...

256
00:18:03,659 --> 00:18:05,324
he's very kind...

257
00:18:05,326 --> 00:18:07,461
Kind of what?

258
00:18:07,463 --> 00:18:09,629
The king and queen
are celebrating tonight...

259
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:12,766
and they have invited
both of us to the castle.

260
00:18:12,768 --> 00:18:18,103
You want me
to meet his parents?

261
00:18:18,105 --> 00:18:19,207
It's just a dinner.

262
00:18:20,476 --> 00:18:23,242
They don't want me
in Ulstead.

263
00:18:23,244 --> 00:18:25,445
Why on earth would I go?

264
00:18:25,447 --> 00:18:28,282
Because his mother
wishes to meet mine.

265
00:18:29,718 --> 00:18:31,285
Please.

266
00:18:39,293 --> 00:18:41,595
Philip.

267
00:18:41,597 --> 00:18:43,197
I want you
to wear this tonight.

268
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:45,832
Your sword?

269
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:46,867
Because of you,

270
00:18:46,869 --> 00:18:49,538
Ulstead and the Moors
will be united at last.

271
00:18:53,207 --> 00:18:54,674
Father,
my love for Aurora

272
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:56,443
has nothing to do
with politics.

273
00:18:56,445 --> 00:18:58,778
Yes, but your love...

274
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,716
will ensure peace
for generations.

275
00:19:02,718 --> 00:19:05,317
Now take it.
And wear it...

276
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:08,289
to know that you will
never have to use it.

277
00:19:09,758 --> 00:19:11,393
Oh, my son.

278
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:15,263
I've never been more proud.

279
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:19,432
And what about Mother?

280
00:19:19,434 --> 00:19:22,435
Is she okay with this?

281
00:19:22,437 --> 00:19:26,542
Your mother will learn
to love who you love.

282
00:20:20,696 --> 00:20:21,697
Oh.

283
00:20:22,664 --> 00:20:25,801
Tomb Bloom.
Tomb Bloom.

284
00:20:38,312 --> 00:20:39,481
Oh.

285
00:20:42,517 --> 00:20:44,352
I'm losing my patience.

286
00:20:44,853 --> 00:20:46,419
Your Majesty.

287
00:20:46,421 --> 00:20:49,221
You need to move faster,
Lickspittle.

288
00:20:49,223 --> 00:20:50,423
Yes, Your Majesty.

289
00:20:52,494 --> 00:20:54,228
Aurora said yes.

290
00:20:58,567 --> 00:21:01,369
It's all coming together...

291
00:21:03,204 --> 00:21:05,139
perfectly.

292
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:15,817
Hello.

293
00:21:16,918 --> 00:21:18,587
Hello.

294
00:21:20,589 --> 00:21:22,256
Hello.

295
00:21:23,959 --> 00:21:26,193
Try it with
a little less fang.

296
00:21:28,797 --> 00:21:30,297
How's this?

297
00:21:32,701 --> 00:21:33,835
Try the greeting.

298
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:38,571
How kind of you
to invite me this evening.

299
00:21:38,573 --> 00:21:41,441
Remember,
it's not a threat.

300
00:21:41,443 --> 00:21:45,447
So very kind of you
to invite me this evening.

301
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:49,449
- Yeah. Better.
- Oh.

302
00:21:49,451 --> 00:21:50,452
Try it with a curtsy.

303
00:21:52,587 --> 00:21:54,389
We can skip that part.

304
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:01,262
She really loves that boy,
you know.

305
00:22:02,831 --> 00:22:04,800
You're doing her
a great kindness.

306
00:22:06,802 --> 00:22:08,537
Kindness?

307
00:22:09,638 --> 00:22:10,639
Mistress...

308
00:22:24,553 --> 00:22:26,353
Doesn't she look lovely?

309
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:32,559
I have something for you.

310
00:22:32,561 --> 00:22:33,562
Hmm?

311
00:22:35,764 --> 00:22:37,331
For your horns.

312
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:39,666
I just thought
it might make

313
00:22:39,668 --> 00:22:41,503
Philip's family
feel more comfortable.

314
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,270
And you, as well.

315
00:22:47,509 --> 00:22:48,975
Maybe it's a bad idea.

316
00:22:48,977 --> 00:22:50,612
No, it's...

317
00:22:52,514 --> 00:22:53,615
It's all right.

318
00:23:02,891 --> 00:23:04,824
I'm so excited.

319
00:23:04,826 --> 00:23:07,994
Mmm... It's more
than I can bear.

320
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:46,501
It's Maleficent!

321
00:23:52,507 --> 00:23:54,107
Pitchforks?

322
00:23:54,109 --> 00:23:56,578
- Humans are hilarious.
- Mmm-hmm.

323
00:24:01,016 --> 00:24:02,551
- It's getting better.
- Hmm.

324
00:24:18,066 --> 00:24:20,466
Anyone leaves
their post gets hung.

325
00:24:20,468 --> 00:24:21,536
Yes, sir.

326
00:24:31,479 --> 00:24:33,048
They're here.

327
00:24:40,155 --> 00:24:42,655
Have you ever considered
turning me into a bear?

328
00:24:42,657 --> 00:24:44,958
I think I'd make
quite an impressive one.

329
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,526
Look at their claws.
They're so strong.

330
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:48,129
Why are we
talking about bears?

331
00:24:49,764 --> 00:24:51,800
Presenting Queen Aurora
of the Moors.

332
00:25:01,643 --> 00:25:03,078
Thank you.

333
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:06,446
You look wonderful.

334
00:25:06,448 --> 00:25:07,916
I'm so happy
to be here.

335
00:25:09,784 --> 00:25:12,487
Aurora, this is
truly an honor.

336
00:25:16,124 --> 00:25:18,426
Welcome to Ulstead.

337
00:25:20,862 --> 00:25:22,996
Such a beautiful girl.

338
00:25:22,998 --> 00:25:25,567
I can see how you stole
Philip's heart.

339
00:25:27,202 --> 00:25:28,937
Your Majesty.

340
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:33,773
The flowers
in your hair.

341
00:25:33,775 --> 00:25:35,575
I'm been to allergic.

342
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:36,876
I'm so sorry.

343
00:25:36,878 --> 00:25:39,078
Oh, no. No, no.
It's all right.

344
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,480
They're beautiful.

345
00:25:40,482 --> 00:25:41,616
Presenting Maleficent.

346
00:25:53,028 --> 00:25:55,929
Maleficent, it's wonderful
to see you again.

347
00:25:57,732 --> 00:26:00,566
This is my father,
King John of Ulstead.

348
00:26:00,568 --> 00:26:02,470
And my mother,
Queen Ingrith.

349
00:26:03,104 --> 00:26:05,874
Welcome to our home.

350
00:26:09,277 --> 00:26:13,980
It's so very kind of you
to invite me this evening.

351
00:26:13,982 --> 00:26:15,116
Don't smile.

352
00:26:17,585 --> 00:26:21,754
And, um, I would like
to introduce you to Diaval.

353
00:26:21,756 --> 00:26:25,525
I trust you had no trouble
finding the castle.

354
00:26:25,527 --> 00:26:27,226
Why would I have trouble?

355
00:26:28,997 --> 00:26:29,998
Shoo!

356
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,266
He's making small talk.

357
00:26:33,268 --> 00:26:35,470
I'll explain it later.

358
00:26:35,937 --> 00:26:37,603
No trouble at all.

359
00:26:37,605 --> 00:26:39,672
Your Majesties,
ladies and gentlemen,

360
00:26:39,674 --> 00:26:41,207
dinner is served.

361
00:26:41,209 --> 00:26:44,577
Please, make yourselves
at home.

362
00:27:01,963 --> 00:27:02,964
Hmm.

363
00:27:13,575 --> 00:27:14,776
Bird.

364
00:27:16,778 --> 00:27:18,279
Delicious.

365
00:27:26,955 --> 00:27:28,590
Is there a problem?

366
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:32,125
It's iron.

367
00:27:32,127 --> 00:27:34,761
Majesty, as you are
sensitive to flowers,

368
00:27:34,763 --> 00:27:36,064
she is averse to iron.

369
00:27:37,999 --> 00:27:39,699
I had no idea.

370
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:42,070
Take it away at once.

371
00:27:47,976 --> 00:27:50,245
I trust you'll be comfortable
using your hands?

372
00:27:52,147 --> 00:27:54,881
Such a warm
spell of weather, isn't it?

373
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:56,282
It certainly is.

374
00:27:58,887 --> 00:27:59,986
Shoo!

375
00:27:59,988 --> 00:28:03,923
Well, we have a small gift
for Philip and Aurora...

376
00:28:03,925 --> 00:28:08,196
to celebrate their
glorious future together. Hmm?

377
00:28:17,305 --> 00:28:18,938
Oh, I simply can't wait

378
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,642
to have a little one running
through the castle again.

379
00:28:25,647 --> 00:28:27,013
This castle?

380
00:28:27,015 --> 00:28:28,316
Yes, of course.

381
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:33,152
This will be their home.

382
00:28:33,154 --> 00:28:36,825
I hear Aurora has
a castle of her own.

383
00:28:37,859 --> 00:28:39,826
Yes, sir, I do.

384
00:28:39,828 --> 00:28:42,295
Yes...

385
00:28:42,297 --> 00:28:47,133
I'm curious. How did Aurora
become Queen of the Moors?

386
00:28:47,135 --> 00:28:49,035
- I made her queen.
- Her castle is

387
00:28:49,037 --> 00:28:50,437
quite stunning.
You must see it.

388
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:53,374
Yes, but in fact,
she has another castle.

389
00:28:54,909 --> 00:28:56,077
Does she not?

390
00:28:57,413 --> 00:28:58,678
Mother...

391
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,779
One in the Moors,

392
00:28:59,781 --> 00:29:02,748
and one left behind
by her father.

393
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:06,352
King Stefan,
was it not?

394
00:29:06,354 --> 00:29:09,657
That castle was never my home.
It was given to the people.

395
00:29:10,758 --> 00:29:13,427
So, you're also
a true princess.

396
00:29:13,429 --> 00:29:15,828
Even though Stefan died.
Was killed?

397
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,665
Remind me, did he die
or was he killed?

398
00:29:18,467 --> 00:29:20,768
Both.

399
00:29:22,404 --> 00:29:24,871
Yes, you're right,
it is very warm recently.

400
00:29:24,873 --> 00:29:28,875
Because I remember
the story of a baby.

401
00:29:28,877 --> 00:29:31,913
A baby cursed to sleep...

402
00:29:32,881 --> 00:29:34,115
and never wake up.

403
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,916
Really?

404
00:29:36,918 --> 00:29:38,317
Who would do
such a terrible thing

405
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:40,389
to an innocent child?

406
00:29:42,391 --> 00:29:46,993
Well, there are many who prey
on the innocent.

407
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:49,496
I'm sure
your kind would agree.

408
00:29:49,498 --> 00:29:51,264
What do you mean,
my kind?

409
00:29:51,266 --> 00:29:53,766
She means humans.

410
00:29:53,768 --> 00:29:55,768
There are fairies missing
from the Moors.

411
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:57,336
What I'm missing
is some wine.

412
00:29:57,338 --> 00:29:59,238
Stolen by human poachers.

413
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,806
That's the first
I've heard of it.

414
00:30:00,808 --> 00:30:02,076
Someone gave the order.

415
00:30:09,884 --> 00:30:12,120
It sounds as if
you're accusing the king.

416
00:30:13,354 --> 00:30:14,887
No, she never said that.

417
00:30:14,889 --> 00:30:17,356
Wait... Sorry,
who would steal a fairy?

418
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:18,758
Your Majesty,
I must report

419
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,992
that two peasants
were found dead...

420
00:30:19,994 --> 00:30:21,961
just outside the Moors.

421
00:30:21,963 --> 00:30:23,829
They'd been missing
for several days.

422
00:30:23,831 --> 00:30:25,364
I see.

423
00:30:25,366 --> 00:30:27,800
Yes, we all see.

424
00:30:27,802 --> 00:30:29,268
The borders are open,

425
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:31,037
but humans are not welcome.
Isn't that right?

426
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,907
What exactly are you implying,
Your Majesty?

427
00:30:34,909 --> 00:30:38,378
Innocent men are being
slaughtered on the Moors...

428
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,148
and she's talking
about fairies.

429
00:30:44,453 --> 00:30:46,553
Contain your animal.

430
00:30:46,555 --> 00:30:48,455
Or I will.

431
00:30:53,261 --> 00:30:54,394
If I didn't know better,

432
00:30:54,396 --> 00:30:55,928
I'd say you were
making a threat.

433
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:57,096
Well, do you?

434
00:30:57,098 --> 00:30:59,198
- Do I what?
- Know better?

435
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,333
Enough.

436
00:31:00,335 --> 00:31:01,736
Put her down.

437
00:31:03,104 --> 00:31:05,073
Please, put her down.

438
00:31:07,308 --> 00:31:10,178
We're here to celebrate.

439
00:31:13,181 --> 00:31:15,382
Forgive me, he's right.

440
00:31:15,384 --> 00:31:17,484
Let's not forget
why we're here.

441
00:31:17,486 --> 00:31:20,422
The start of a new life
for Aurora.

442
00:31:22,458 --> 00:31:24,025
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

443
00:31:28,162 --> 00:31:31,998
You have done an admirable
job, Maleficent...

444
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,037
going against your own nature
to raise this child.

445
00:31:36,605 --> 00:31:38,538
But now...

446
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:42,208
Aurora will finally get...

447
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:44,480
the love of a real family.

448
00:31:45,381 --> 00:31:46,979
A real mother.

449
00:31:46,981 --> 00:31:50,349
Because the one thing
I regret...

450
00:31:50,351 --> 00:31:53,219
is never having a daughter
of my own.

451
00:31:53,221 --> 00:31:56,222
But tonight changes that.

452
00:31:56,224 --> 00:32:01,563
Tonight,
I consider Aurora my own.

453
00:32:16,077 --> 00:32:17,243
Guards!

454
00:32:17,245 --> 00:32:19,345
We have opened our home
to a witch!

455
00:32:29,957 --> 00:32:30,992
Stop!

456
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,493
There is no union.

457
00:32:33,495 --> 00:32:35,194
There will be no wedding.

458
00:32:35,196 --> 00:32:38,064
- Maleficent!
- We must protect the king!

459
00:32:38,066 --> 00:32:39,899
Maleficent, please, stop now.

460
00:32:39,901 --> 00:32:42,170
John, I'm so frightened.

461
00:32:42,538 --> 00:32:43,637
Ah!

462
00:32:43,639 --> 00:32:45,938
What has she done to me?

463
00:32:47,241 --> 00:32:48,242
Father!

464
00:32:50,278 --> 00:32:51,279
John!

465
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:53,214
We go home.

466
00:32:55,083 --> 00:32:56,084
John!

467
00:32:57,251 --> 00:32:58,252
It's a curse.

468
00:33:00,922 --> 00:33:02,522
It's a curse!

469
00:33:02,524 --> 00:33:04,460
Maleficent has cursed
the king!

470
00:33:07,295 --> 00:33:08,495
What have you done?

471
00:33:08,497 --> 00:33:10,331
I've done nothing.

472
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:13,569
Aurora, we go home now.

473
00:33:15,637 --> 00:33:16,638
Aurora!

474
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:32,017
Aurora!

475
00:33:32,019 --> 00:33:33,354
Wake him!

476
00:33:35,557 --> 00:33:37,393
Wake him, please.

477
00:35:00,709 --> 00:35:02,210
Stand aside!

478
00:35:04,446 --> 00:35:05,647
To the bedroom!

479
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:10,151
This magic, we have
no tools to reverse it.

480
00:35:12,688 --> 00:35:15,054
There must be a lesion.

481
00:35:15,056 --> 00:35:16,188
Proof of her witchery.

482
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:19,158
Please,
leave His Majesty his dignity.

483
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,361
We all saw what Maleficent
did to him.

484
00:35:22,363 --> 00:35:24,230
I'm so sorry.

485
00:35:24,232 --> 00:35:27,569
A curse upon our king
is a curse upon this kingdom.

486
00:35:29,203 --> 00:35:32,238
All he wanted was peace.

487
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,407
This is all my fault.

488
00:35:34,409 --> 00:35:36,612
You have nothing
to apologize for, my dear.

489
00:35:37,779 --> 00:35:41,581
Maleficent is a threat
to everyone.

490
00:35:41,583 --> 00:35:43,452
Especially you.

491
00:35:44,653 --> 00:35:47,021
We'll do our best
to protect you.

492
00:35:48,122 --> 00:35:50,224
There must be a way
to reverse this.

493
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,362
Mother, could you
try kissing him?

494
00:35:56,398 --> 00:35:58,433
True love and all that.

495
00:36:02,704 --> 00:36:04,604
I doubt
that would work.

496
00:36:04,606 --> 00:36:06,138
It could save him.

497
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,775
- A kiss is just a kiss.
- Please, Mother.

498
00:36:08,777 --> 00:36:10,479
Very well.

499
00:36:21,222 --> 00:36:23,590
You wanted peace...

500
00:36:23,592 --> 00:36:26,595
now rest in peace forever.

501
00:36:35,537 --> 00:36:37,604
I told you.

502
00:36:37,606 --> 00:36:41,240
This is no fairy tale.

503
00:36:41,242 --> 00:36:43,476
I have to return
to the Moors.

504
00:36:43,478 --> 00:36:44,644
It's the only way.

505
00:36:44,646 --> 00:36:46,145
Wait, wait. Come here.

506
00:36:46,147 --> 00:36:47,647
I have to find her.

507
00:36:47,649 --> 00:36:48,782
It's the middle
of the night.

508
00:36:48,784 --> 00:36:50,650
She will break the curse.
I know she will.

509
00:36:50,652 --> 00:36:52,719
Okay, well,
let me come with you.

510
00:36:52,721 --> 00:36:55,154
No. You should stay
with your family.

511
00:36:55,156 --> 00:36:56,425
You are my family.

512
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,560
Let her go, Philip.

513
00:37:00,562 --> 00:37:02,798
Maybe she can save him.

514
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,553
Maleficent!

515
00:38:03,959 --> 00:38:05,727
Maleficent!

516
00:38:13,334 --> 00:38:14,968
Godmother!

517
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:24,245
Please come back.

518
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:29,451
She's not in the Moors.

519
00:38:30,819 --> 00:38:31,820
Diaval.

520
00:38:33,522 --> 00:38:35,320
No one's seen her.

521
00:38:35,322 --> 00:38:36,825
I'm so happy to see you.

522
00:38:38,694 --> 00:38:39,961
She's nowhere to be found.

523
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:43,463
What if she
never comes back?

524
00:38:43,465 --> 00:38:45,732
I could be stuck
as a human forever.

525
00:38:45,734 --> 00:38:47,436
I have to find her.

526
00:38:50,505 --> 00:38:53,307
She's the only one
who can break the curse.

527
00:39:53,367 --> 00:39:54,669
Tell me she's dead.

528
00:39:55,704 --> 00:39:58,071
The iron pierced her flesh.

529
00:39:58,073 --> 00:40:00,742
She fell into the river
and went over the falls.

530
00:40:02,343 --> 00:40:05,545
Then where is her head?

531
00:40:05,547 --> 00:40:07,814
There was something else.

532
00:40:07,816 --> 00:40:10,083
Another creature.

533
00:40:10,085 --> 00:40:13,586
It pulled her from
the depths of the sea.

534
00:40:13,588 --> 00:40:15,289
What did it look like?

535
00:40:15,757 --> 00:40:16,758
Her.

536
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,660
It carried her
up into the sky.

537
00:40:20,662 --> 00:40:23,129
Hmm. A wounded animal
lashes out

538
00:40:23,131 --> 00:40:24,631
and now she's not alone.

539
00:40:24,633 --> 00:40:27,334
We must be ready for war.

540
00:40:30,405 --> 00:40:31,973
Maleficent has
cursed the king!

541
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:39,781
Stay inside!

542
00:40:47,055 --> 00:40:48,690
Maleficent has
cursed the king!

543
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:25,587
If Conall hadn't
found her, she would be dead.

544
00:42:29,524 --> 00:42:31,126
They tried to kill her
with this.

545
00:42:47,976 --> 00:42:49,945
Do you hear it?

546
00:42:51,212 --> 00:42:52,447
Do you hear it?

547
00:42:54,082 --> 00:42:55,083
Huh?

548
00:42:56,151 --> 00:42:57,819
It's a message
from the humans.

549
00:42:59,254 --> 00:43:01,056
I hear it loud and clear.

550
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:05,124
Time for us to die.

551
00:43:05,126 --> 00:43:08,928
Humans have used iron
against us for centuries.

552
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:11,564
And we are almost extinct
because of it.

553
00:43:11,566 --> 00:43:13,066
Killing peasants
on the Moors

554
00:43:13,068 --> 00:43:15,868
will only lead
to more conflict, Borra.

555
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:17,603
They've pulled the iron
from the earth...

556
00:43:17,605 --> 00:43:20,273
made their swords and shields,
drove us underground.

557
00:43:20,275 --> 00:43:21,743
But this...

558
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:26,212
This will finish us.

559
00:43:26,214 --> 00:43:28,214
Our people are safe
here for now.

560
00:43:28,216 --> 00:43:29,916
But for how long?

561
00:43:29,918 --> 00:43:31,820
The humans will find us.
They will not stop.

562
00:43:32,654 --> 00:43:34,721
I call for war.

563
00:43:36,157 --> 00:43:37,924
I call for war!

564
00:43:37,926 --> 00:43:39,225
Right now!

565
00:43:40,295 --> 00:43:42,230
There are
too many humans.

566
00:43:44,899 --> 00:43:46,032
Too many kingdoms.

567
00:43:46,034 --> 00:43:48,167
Conall,
they will keep finding

568
00:43:48,169 --> 00:43:50,103
new ways to destroy us.

569
00:43:50,105 --> 00:43:51,773
We can't win.

570
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:58,046
We can't win!

571
00:44:00,815 --> 00:44:01,816
Not this way.

572
00:44:03,184 --> 00:44:05,253
No. You're wrong, Conall.

573
00:44:07,155 --> 00:44:09,691
We have something
they didn't plan on.

574
00:44:12,027 --> 00:44:13,895
We have her.

575
00:44:19,067 --> 00:44:20,902
She holds powers
none of us possess.

576
00:44:23,138 --> 00:44:24,672
She is wounded, Borra.

577
00:44:26,007 --> 00:44:27,275
Who are you?

578
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:40,088
Hmm.

579
00:44:42,257 --> 00:44:43,956
Hmm.

580
00:44:43,958 --> 00:44:46,094
You reek of human.

581
00:44:48,029 --> 00:44:50,129
Maybe I was wrong about you.

582
00:44:50,131 --> 00:44:52,265
Or maybe Conall should have
left you for dead

583
00:44:52,267 --> 00:44:53,735
at the bottom of the sea.

584
00:44:57,705 --> 00:44:58,873
No.

585
00:45:00,275 --> 00:45:02,310
It's there, isn't it?

586
00:45:03,978 --> 00:45:05,180
It's inside you.

587
00:45:06,247 --> 00:45:07,346
Mmm.

588
00:45:08,883 --> 00:45:10,618
Ahhh!

589
00:45:24,232 --> 00:45:25,300
You see?

590
00:45:29,671 --> 00:45:31,904
You see what's inside her?

591
00:45:33,675 --> 00:45:35,274
That is what will save us all.

592
00:45:53,328 --> 00:45:54,929
You saved me.

593
00:45:58,467 --> 00:45:59,868
Come.

594
00:46:04,473 --> 00:46:06,908
Let me show you who we are.

595
00:47:02,897 --> 00:47:04,032
We're Dark Fey.

596
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,101
Same as you.

597
00:47:18,913 --> 00:47:20,081
We're all that remain.

598
00:47:21,916 --> 00:47:24,352
Unseen here,
far away from mankind.

599
00:47:24,986 --> 00:47:26,085
Look!

600
00:47:27,322 --> 00:47:28,988
As more
human kingdoms emerged,

601
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:30,557
we went into hiding...

602
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:33,125
from every corner
of the earth...

603
00:47:33,127 --> 00:47:36,295
doing what we had to,
to survive.

604
00:47:36,297 --> 00:47:39,033
But many were lost.

605
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:04,123
Only a few
generations ago...

606
00:48:04,125 --> 00:48:06,327
our kind roamed
every part of the world.

607
00:48:07,862 --> 00:48:09,195
The tundra.

608
00:48:09,197 --> 00:48:10,564
The forest.

609
00:48:10,566 --> 00:48:12,066
The jungle.

610
00:48:16,104 --> 00:48:18,039
The desert.

611
00:48:22,444 --> 00:48:26,380
Now, our only refuge
is here...

612
00:48:26,382 --> 00:48:28,180
in this cave.

613
00:48:28,182 --> 00:48:30,283
Our nest of origin.

614
00:48:34,556 --> 00:48:37,191
Listen.
Play in the wind.

615
00:48:38,993 --> 00:48:39,994
Go!

616
00:49:00,148 --> 00:49:01,381
Those children
should be soaring

617
00:49:01,383 --> 00:49:03,550
over the trees and rivers.

618
00:49:03,552 --> 00:49:05,487
Instead,
they are raised in exile.

619
00:49:06,187 --> 00:49:07,556
I could protect them.

620
00:49:09,425 --> 00:49:12,224
How? By waging war
against the humans?

621
00:49:12,226 --> 00:49:14,293
I've been at war with them
my whole life.

622
00:49:14,295 --> 00:49:16,295
Not all of them.

623
00:49:16,297 --> 00:49:18,567
There was one you raised
as your own.

624
00:49:21,069 --> 00:49:24,170
Maybe we don't have to hide
from the humans.

625
00:49:24,172 --> 00:49:26,238
Maybe we can exist
without fear...

626
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,442
and war.

627
00:49:28,444 --> 00:49:30,945
Find a way together.

628
00:49:32,548 --> 00:49:34,349
That will never happen.

629
00:50:02,343 --> 00:50:04,011
Oh.

630
00:50:20,629 --> 00:50:22,230
Whoa.

631
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:30,271
Whoa!

632
00:50:53,629 --> 00:50:55,597
Ow! Oh.

633
00:50:56,364 --> 00:50:57,365
Huh?

634
00:51:06,475 --> 00:51:07,476
Gotcha!

635
00:51:12,648 --> 00:51:15,617
Welcome to your new home.

636
00:51:34,636 --> 00:51:37,171
We've been worried
about you, dear.

637
00:51:38,206 --> 00:51:39,207
Your Majesty.

638
00:51:40,174 --> 00:51:42,208
I couldn't find her.

639
00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:44,713
My heart breaks for you.

640
00:51:45,747 --> 00:51:48,214
She has brought
a cloud of darkness

641
00:51:48,216 --> 00:51:49,283
upon your happiness.

642
00:51:50,385 --> 00:51:53,386
I know she was
against this marriage.

643
00:51:53,388 --> 00:51:56,723
Never trusted your
instincts as a queen.

644
00:51:56,725 --> 00:51:59,360
When I saw her at dinner...

645
00:52:00,629 --> 00:52:03,432
with her horns covered...

646
00:52:05,767 --> 00:52:07,536
bent cowering...

647
00:52:12,373 --> 00:52:16,043
Well, it's no wonder
that she lashed out.

648
00:52:17,078 --> 00:52:19,178
I just don't know
what to do.

649
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:22,081
You do truly love him,
don't you?

650
00:52:22,083 --> 00:52:23,418
My son.

651
00:52:23,819 --> 00:52:25,019
Deeply.

652
00:52:26,254 --> 00:52:28,757
It is love
that will heal you.

653
00:52:29,591 --> 00:52:32,124
It's what heals us all.

654
00:52:32,126 --> 00:52:35,329
Let's move
forward together...

655
00:52:36,197 --> 00:52:37,766
as a family.

656
00:52:54,348 --> 00:52:57,283
<i>To all who live
on the Moors...</i>

657
00:52:59,253 --> 00:53:01,421
What is that noise?

658
00:53:01,423 --> 00:53:03,188
<i>...and kingdoms
far and wide,</i>

659
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:04,524
<i>the king and queen
invite you...</i>

660
00:53:04,526 --> 00:53:07,192
<i>to attend the wedding...</i>

661
00:53:07,194 --> 00:53:10,164
<i>of their son Philip to Aurora
in three days' time.</i>

662
00:53:10,832 --> 00:53:12,599
<i>All are welcome.</i>

663
00:53:12,601 --> 00:53:13,602
Huh?

664
00:53:15,537 --> 00:53:18,272
<i>And all are expected!</i>

665
00:53:19,508 --> 00:53:22,207
Did you hear that?
We're invited to the castle!

666
00:53:22,209 --> 00:53:24,411
I knew Aurora
wouldn't abandon us!

667
00:53:24,413 --> 00:53:26,613
I always knew
I'd be invited.

668
00:53:26,615 --> 00:53:29,549
Just glad you two
made the cut.

669
00:53:29,551 --> 00:53:31,386
Who's getting married?

670
00:53:39,561 --> 00:53:43,432
Aurora, we don't have to think
about the wedding right now.

671
00:53:44,766 --> 00:53:46,766
The queen is right.

672
00:53:46,768 --> 00:53:49,536
We owe it to everyone...

673
00:53:49,538 --> 00:53:51,707
especially the king.

674
00:53:52,574 --> 00:53:54,576
What about Maleficent?

675
00:53:57,679 --> 00:53:59,781
She's gone.

676
00:54:12,594 --> 00:54:14,259
The Phoenix.

677
00:54:14,261 --> 00:54:16,531
It is said the Dark Fey
began with her...

678
00:54:17,833 --> 00:54:19,868
evolved over centuries.

679
00:54:21,703 --> 00:54:24,138
You are the last
of her descendants.

680
00:54:24,773 --> 00:54:27,274
Her blood is your own.

681
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:30,612
You are her.

682
00:54:33,849 --> 00:54:37,517
In your hands,
you hold the power of life and death...

683
00:54:37,519 --> 00:54:40,354
destruction and rebirth.

684
00:54:41,623 --> 00:54:44,223
But nature's greatest power

685
00:54:44,225 --> 00:54:47,361
is the power
of true transformation.

686
00:54:48,997 --> 00:54:52,401
You transformed
when you raised Aurora.

687
00:54:54,301 --> 00:54:56,603
When you found love...

688
00:54:56,605 --> 00:54:59,675
in the middle of your pain.

689
00:55:01,443 --> 00:55:03,945
I'm asking you
to take all of your fury...

690
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:06,515
all of your pain...

691
00:55:06,948 --> 00:55:09,649
and not use it.

692
00:55:09,651 --> 00:55:12,888
Help us broker peace
with the humans.

693
00:55:14,723 --> 00:55:16,690
Because peace...

694
00:55:16,692 --> 00:55:21,295
could be the Dark Fey's
final transformation.

695
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:32,806
The Moors are our last
true nature on earth.

696
00:55:32,808 --> 00:55:36,910
And yet you named
a human as queen.

697
00:55:36,912 --> 00:55:39,614
A daughter you cared for.

698
00:55:41,683 --> 00:55:43,819
I have no daughter.

699
00:55:46,555 --> 00:55:48,824
She has chosen her side.

700
00:56:01,335 --> 00:56:03,503
We've just heard.

701
00:56:03,505 --> 00:56:06,273
There's going to be a wedding
at the castle in three days.

702
00:56:07,776 --> 00:56:10,543
Humans will come
from all over.

703
00:56:10,545 --> 00:56:12,545
That's when we attack.

704
00:56:12,547 --> 00:56:15,482
We'll kill the king
and queen of Ulstead...

705
00:56:15,484 --> 00:56:17,486
and their young prince.

706
00:56:20,088 --> 00:56:22,856
Their kingdom will fall.

707
00:56:22,858 --> 00:56:25,527
And the Fey will rise again.

708
00:56:41,409 --> 00:56:43,912
The fairies made it.

709
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:02,564
I wore it when I
married the king.

710
00:57:09,104 --> 00:57:12,040
I'm sure it's perfect.

711
00:57:12,674 --> 00:57:14,009
So am I.

712
00:57:20,048 --> 00:57:22,849
Your Majesty,
she's absolutely lovely.

713
00:57:22,851 --> 00:57:24,651
Considering
how she was raised.

714
00:57:24,653 --> 00:57:27,620
By the same evil witch
who cursed her.

715
00:57:27,622 --> 00:57:30,523
It's a miracle Prince
Philip came along.

716
00:57:30,525 --> 00:57:31,658
It's a miracle

717
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:33,495
the poor child is
alive at all.

718
00:57:34,729 --> 00:57:36,796
Thank you so much.

719
00:57:36,798 --> 00:57:37,664
It's exquisite.

720
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:10,063
<i>When I'm older...</i>

721
00:58:10,065 --> 00:58:11,900
I'm going to live here,
in the Moors, with you.

722
00:58:12,968 --> 00:58:15,503
Then we can
look after each other.

723
00:58:36,758 --> 00:58:38,693
- Tell me what's troubling you.
- It's nothing.

724
00:58:39,861 --> 00:58:42,497
Aurora, I know you
better than that.

725
00:58:45,166 --> 00:58:46,534
This jewelry...

726
00:58:47,469 --> 00:58:48,868
my hair...

727
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:51,004
all these rules.

728
00:58:51,006 --> 00:58:54,741
I just... I can't breathe.

729
00:58:54,743 --> 00:58:57,710
I feel like I'm not
Queen of the Moors anymore.

730
00:58:57,712 --> 00:59:00,013
I feel like
a different person.

731
00:59:00,015 --> 00:59:01,881
Listen...

732
00:59:01,883 --> 00:59:05,518
I fell in love with a girl
in the forest and only her.

733
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,053
You don't have to change.

734
00:59:07,055 --> 00:59:09,157
I don't want you to change.

735
00:59:17,565 --> 00:59:20,602
I should have never asked her
to wear that scarf.

736
00:59:39,788 --> 00:59:41,022
Ah, yes.

737
00:59:43,124 --> 00:59:44,125
Well...

738
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:47,226
Does it work?

739
00:59:47,228 --> 00:59:49,028
I only have a handful

740
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:49,996
of fairy specimens
to work with...

741
00:59:49,998 --> 00:59:52,767
and the extraction process
is painstaking.

742
00:59:53,735 --> 00:59:55,537
Extraction from what?

743
00:59:56,538 --> 00:59:58,771
Tomb Bloom flowers.

744
00:59:58,773 --> 01:00:00,006
They grow from
a fairy's grave,

745
01:00:00,008 --> 01:00:01,774
contain their very essence.

746
01:00:01,776 --> 01:00:03,776
When you mix the pollen
with iron powder...

747
01:00:03,778 --> 01:00:06,746
the resulting dust
ends a fairy's life.

748
01:00:06,748 --> 01:00:08,249
We will need thousands more.

749
01:00:10,151 --> 01:00:11,586
Show me.

750
01:00:13,621 --> 01:00:15,021
Show me.

751
01:00:15,023 --> 01:00:16,024
Very well.

752
01:00:19,127 --> 01:00:20,259
So...

753
01:01:10,345 --> 01:01:14,182
Finally,
the Moors will be mine.

754
01:01:14,849 --> 01:01:17,984
No more fairies.

755
01:01:52,087 --> 01:01:53,188
Stay alert, men.

756
01:02:09,737 --> 01:02:12,038
Wow!

757
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:13,206
This is where
I found them.

758
01:02:13,208 --> 01:02:14,874
Excellent.

759
01:02:14,876 --> 01:02:16,709
But what if
the winged one returns?

760
01:02:16,711 --> 01:02:18,646
Don't you worry about that.

761
01:02:19,381 --> 01:02:20,713
We'll be ready.

762
01:02:20,715 --> 01:02:21,850
Take the Tomb Blooms.

763
01:02:22,451 --> 01:02:24,451
Get to work!

764
01:02:40,101 --> 01:02:41,267
Sentries, stay alert!

765
01:02:41,269 --> 01:02:42,737
Keep your weapons on hand.

766
01:03:03,224 --> 01:03:04,759
Move it!

767
01:03:12,501 --> 01:03:14,068
Maleficent...

768
01:03:57,078 --> 01:04:00,014
This is where
we bury our dead.

769
01:04:01,249 --> 01:04:03,151
They've destroyed it.

770
01:04:07,855 --> 01:04:10,256
This is what
the humans do.

771
01:04:10,258 --> 01:04:12,792
They're nothing but locusts
that swarm the earth.

772
01:04:12,794 --> 01:04:14,329
We have to stop them.

773
01:04:16,931 --> 01:04:20,266
You spent years
caring for a human...

774
01:04:20,268 --> 01:04:23,271
now it's time
to care for your own.

775
01:04:32,914 --> 01:04:33,948
Fire!

776
01:04:54,302 --> 01:04:57,238
Reload! We go again!

777
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:03,545
Fire!

778
01:05:07,215 --> 01:05:09,817
Reload!
There's another one!

779
01:06:26,662 --> 01:06:28,628
Everyone, stay together!

780
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:30,497
We're about to leave
the Moors.

781
01:06:30,499 --> 01:06:32,198
Grab the hand or the wing...

782
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:34,503
or the tail of whoever
is closest to you.

783
01:07:16,545 --> 01:07:19,211
Hey, over here!
Yeah, over here!

784
01:07:19,213 --> 01:07:21,282
Hold formation, guards.
Hold formation.

785
01:07:23,017 --> 01:07:25,117
- Excuse me, sir.
- Stop right there.

786
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:26,285
I'm with the bride.

787
01:07:26,287 --> 01:07:28,354
We've been told to let
the, uh, other kind

788
01:07:28,356 --> 01:07:29,489
find their seats first.

789
01:07:29,491 --> 01:07:30,690
But I'm not a human.

790
01:07:30,692 --> 01:07:32,626
- I'm a raven.
- What?

791
01:07:32,628 --> 01:07:35,395
A raven. The black bird.

792
01:07:35,397 --> 01:07:37,664
Mmm. This rice is delicious.

793
01:07:37,666 --> 01:07:39,231
You're supposed
to throw it

794
01:07:39,233 --> 01:07:40,434
at the bride and groom.

795
01:07:40,436 --> 01:07:43,102
What? And waste good rice?

796
01:07:43,104 --> 01:07:44,203
What's the hold up?

797
01:07:45,273 --> 01:07:46,440
Let me in!

798
01:07:46,442 --> 01:07:48,410
Why can't humans come in, too?

799
01:07:50,144 --> 01:07:51,613
Why can't we come in?

800
01:07:59,086 --> 01:08:00,219
I know it's bad luck...

801
01:08:00,221 --> 01:08:01,956
but I had to see you.

802
01:08:03,459 --> 01:08:04,758
For you.

803
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:06,626
A Tomb Bloom?

804
01:08:06,628 --> 01:08:07,694
Where did you get this?

805
01:08:07,696 --> 01:08:09,463
From my mother.

806
01:08:09,465 --> 01:08:12,200
The sun's up.
It's our wedding day.

807
01:08:19,708 --> 01:08:22,076
<i>From my mother.</i>

808
01:11:11,278 --> 01:11:12,946
Where should we sit, Flittle?

809
01:11:12,948 --> 01:11:14,981
On the left.
We're with the bride.

810
01:11:14,983 --> 01:11:16,716
Yes, we are.

811
01:11:16,718 --> 01:11:18,585
But the groom's lovely, too.

812
01:11:18,587 --> 01:11:20,389
Mmm. Yes, he is.

813
01:11:21,322 --> 01:11:22,956
I'm with both.

814
01:11:22,958 --> 01:11:25,192
Huh?

815
01:11:31,767 --> 01:11:33,669
Now.

816
01:11:57,258 --> 01:11:58,925
What's this?

817
01:11:58,927 --> 01:12:00,794
Nobody is allowed in here
except me.

818
01:12:00,796 --> 01:12:03,598
And I'm already here,
so go away!

819
01:12:21,783 --> 01:12:23,350
Maleficent, please stop.

820
01:12:30,459 --> 01:12:32,291
Maleficent.

821
01:12:32,293 --> 01:12:33,628
She didn't do it.

822
01:12:37,399 --> 01:12:38,400
Get out!

823
01:12:40,035 --> 01:12:41,366
Before I call the guards!

824
01:12:48,076 --> 01:12:49,809
The missing fairies.

825
01:12:49,811 --> 01:12:51,343
I said get out.
Did you hear me?

826
01:12:51,345 --> 01:12:53,980
What have you done?

827
01:12:58,319 --> 01:13:00,019
You're a pixie.

828
01:13:00,021 --> 01:13:01,588
How dare you call me that?

829
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:03,690
I'm Lickspittle,
the nobleman...

830
01:13:03,692 --> 01:13:05,494
and I serve the queen.

831
01:13:06,327 --> 01:13:08,463
She took your wings.

832
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:14,000
We have to release them.

833
01:13:14,002 --> 01:13:15,802
They belong on the Moors.

834
01:13:15,804 --> 01:13:16,870
As you do, Aurora.

835
01:13:18,907 --> 01:13:22,444
A human who has betrayed
her kind.

836
01:13:29,017 --> 01:13:30,984
You put the curse
on the king.

837
01:13:30,986 --> 01:13:33,052
Oh, dear.

838
01:13:33,054 --> 01:13:35,655
You may be queen...

839
01:13:35,657 --> 01:13:37,457
but you are very young.

840
01:13:37,459 --> 01:13:40,560
Ruling humans is a bit
more complicated...

841
01:13:40,562 --> 01:13:44,432
than running around barefoot
with flowers in your hair.

842
01:13:47,135 --> 01:13:49,336
When I was young...

843
01:13:50,772 --> 01:13:53,573
my family's kingdom
bordered the Moors.

844
01:13:53,575 --> 01:13:57,911
And one particularly
harsh winter...

845
01:13:57,913 --> 01:13:59,746
our crops died...

846
01:13:59,748 --> 01:14:03,483
and the people
began to suffer.

847
01:14:03,485 --> 01:14:06,085
And as we looked
over our walls...

848
01:14:06,087 --> 01:14:10,456
we could see
the fairies thriving.

849
01:14:10,458 --> 01:14:13,393
My brother and I believed we
should take what we needed...

850
01:14:13,395 --> 01:14:18,500
while my father, the king,
sought their kindness.

851
01:14:19,434 --> 01:14:21,467
Choosing peace
over our people,

852
01:14:21,469 --> 01:14:23,803
he sent my brother
to do his bidding.

853
01:14:23,805 --> 01:14:25,907
He never came back.

854
01:14:27,509 --> 01:14:29,008
Those savages...

855
01:14:29,010 --> 01:14:30,643
creatures who could
barely grunt,

856
01:14:30,645 --> 01:14:33,014
let alone engage in talks,
killed him.

857
01:14:33,849 --> 01:14:35,415
I don't believe that.

858
01:14:35,417 --> 01:14:36,783
Our people became fearful.

859
01:14:36,785 --> 01:14:39,619
They overthrew my father.

860
01:14:39,621 --> 01:14:43,489
The land fell into chaos.
I was cast out.

861
01:14:43,491 --> 01:14:48,428
Forced by fate into marriage
with King John of Ulstead.

862
01:14:48,430 --> 01:14:50,163
Another weak king

863
01:14:50,165 --> 01:14:52,899
speaking of
tolerance and civility.

864
01:14:52,901 --> 01:14:55,501
And now, my own son...

865
01:14:55,503 --> 01:14:59,505
corrupted with visions
of harmony.

866
01:14:59,507 --> 01:15:01,877
But peace
will not be our downfall.

867
01:15:06,948 --> 01:15:08,783
Now lock her up.

868
01:15:09,885 --> 01:15:11,887
A war is coming.

869
01:15:17,726 --> 01:15:19,694
No! No!

870
01:15:28,036 --> 01:15:30,572
I wish you could be here
with me.

871
01:15:39,648 --> 01:15:41,149
Conall wanted peace...

872
01:15:43,518 --> 01:15:46,121
<i>and they filled him with iron.</i>

873
01:15:47,689 --> 01:15:50,025
Now, we will have our war.

874
01:15:52,093 --> 01:15:55,261
Our fight begins now!

875
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:58,064
We will rise together!

876
01:15:58,066 --> 01:16:00,633
We fight together.

877
01:16:00,635 --> 01:16:05,004
And we will show them
no mercy!

878
01:16:21,923 --> 01:16:24,059
Come on! Go!

879
01:16:28,530 --> 01:16:31,531
Go! Go!

880
01:16:31,533 --> 01:16:34,035
Go! Go! Go!

881
01:16:47,916 --> 01:16:49,882
Where are all Philip's guests?

882
01:16:49,884 --> 01:16:52,053
- Humans are poor timekeepers.
- Mmm.

883
01:17:18,780 --> 01:17:21,016
Start the music.

884
01:17:38,733 --> 01:17:40,600
Come on! Come on!

885
01:18:44,666 --> 01:18:45,667
She's gone.

886
01:18:47,202 --> 01:18:48,203
Hey!

887
01:18:58,746 --> 01:19:01,116
It's a trap! Get down!

888
01:19:19,934 --> 01:19:21,236
Your Majesty...

889
01:19:22,337 --> 01:19:24,839
they're coming from the sea.

890
01:19:34,450 --> 01:19:35,715
She escaped!

891
01:19:42,190 --> 01:19:44,159
Down this way, come on!

892
01:19:51,833 --> 01:19:53,299
Your Highness.

893
01:19:53,301 --> 01:19:54,836
Upon my command.

894
01:20:05,747 --> 01:20:07,046
Check every room!

895
01:20:09,117 --> 01:20:10,118
She can't be far!

896
01:20:43,084 --> 01:20:44,085
Wait.

897
01:20:45,454 --> 01:20:46,788
Wait.

898
01:21:10,311 --> 01:21:12,113
What's going on?

899
01:21:16,351 --> 01:21:17,850
Now.

900
01:21:17,852 --> 01:21:18,951
Fire!

901
01:21:28,129 --> 01:21:29,529
No!

902
01:21:56,257 --> 01:21:58,326
They look just like her.

903
01:22:02,330 --> 01:22:04,063
Withdraw!

904
01:22:04,065 --> 01:22:06,100
Withdraw!

905
01:22:07,068 --> 01:22:08,968
Pull back!

906
01:22:08,970 --> 01:22:10,404
Maleficent's
starting a war.

907
01:22:10,406 --> 01:22:12,872
First my father,
and now this.

908
01:22:12,874 --> 01:22:15,141
Philip!
She didn't curse him.

909
01:22:15,143 --> 01:22:17,243
- Maleficent.
- What?

910
01:22:17,245 --> 01:22:19,013
She never cursed him.

911
01:22:20,114 --> 01:22:21,947
It was your mother.

912
01:22:21,949 --> 01:22:23,249
What are you saying?

913
01:22:23,251 --> 01:22:24,420
It was the spindle.

914
01:22:29,625 --> 01:22:31,558
The curse is still in it.

915
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:34,262
Your mother used it
against your father.

916
01:22:36,064 --> 01:22:37,399
Look.

917
01:22:39,901 --> 01:22:41,601
It's the same.

918
01:22:41,603 --> 01:22:44,370
She's locked the Moor folk
in the chapel.

919
01:22:44,372 --> 01:22:45,672
This isn't a wedding.

920
01:22:45,674 --> 01:22:47,875
It's a trap.

921
01:22:52,448 --> 01:22:54,982
Remember where
you came from.

922
01:22:55,651 --> 01:22:57,952
Remember who you are.

923
01:23:01,155 --> 01:23:03,091
I've made my choice.

924
01:23:04,192 --> 01:23:06,194
You'll have to make yours.

925
01:23:34,423 --> 01:23:36,057
Stay low!

926
01:23:38,292 --> 01:23:39,395
Divide!

927
01:23:41,630 --> 01:23:43,231
Follow me!

928
01:23:52,206 --> 01:23:53,241
Attack!

929
01:23:54,543 --> 01:23:56,208
Attack!

930
01:24:07,188 --> 01:24:08,990
- Ignite!
- Ignite!

931
01:24:19,066 --> 01:24:20,268
No!

932
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:06,080
Aunties! Aunties!

933
01:25:09,217 --> 01:25:10,519
It's too heavy!

934
01:25:11,787 --> 01:25:13,285
Aurora!

935
01:25:13,287 --> 01:25:14,456
Diaval! You're here.

936
01:25:17,693 --> 01:25:19,461
Oh, what's happening?

937
01:25:39,815 --> 01:25:41,282
Weapon change!

938
01:25:43,251 --> 01:25:44,386
Weapon change! Go!

939
01:26:24,693 --> 01:26:25,694
Mother!

940
01:26:26,628 --> 01:26:28,260
You have to stop this.

941
01:26:28,262 --> 01:26:29,763
We are at war.

942
01:26:29,765 --> 01:26:31,798
This isn't a war.
It's a massacre.

943
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:33,533
Philip,
you don't understand.

944
01:26:33,535 --> 01:26:36,403
These creatures stand
between us...

945
01:26:36,405 --> 01:26:39,204
and everything
we need to survive.

946
01:26:39,206 --> 01:26:40,540
You're wrong.

947
01:26:40,542 --> 01:26:42,174
We can stand together.

948
01:26:42,176 --> 01:26:44,878
Well, you're a fool
to believe that.

949
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:48,316
You don't know what it takes
to fight for our kind.

950
01:26:49,216 --> 01:26:50,485
You lied to me.

951
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:53,620
I am protecting the kingdom...

952
01:26:53,622 --> 01:26:56,355
and your throne.

953
01:26:56,357 --> 01:26:57,526
What about Father?

954
01:26:59,226 --> 01:27:02,263
Were you protecting him, too?

955
01:27:04,533 --> 01:27:06,868
The prince
is not feeling well.

956
01:27:08,169 --> 01:27:09,905
See him to his chambers.

957
01:27:13,775 --> 01:27:14,776
Now.

958
01:27:19,381 --> 01:27:20,549
Sire, stop!

959
01:27:47,476 --> 01:27:49,876
Yield! Yield!

960
01:27:49,878 --> 01:27:50,944
My mother cursed the king

961
01:27:50,946 --> 01:27:52,244
so she could destroy
the Moor folk.

962
01:27:52,246 --> 01:27:54,381
Your men are paying
heavily for it.

963
01:28:01,222 --> 01:28:03,723
We have to do something!

964
01:28:07,228 --> 01:28:08,628
Goodbye, girls.

965
01:28:09,831 --> 01:28:11,931
No, come back!

966
01:28:11,933 --> 01:28:13,735
Flittle! No!

967
01:28:26,415 --> 01:28:27,781
No!

968
01:28:27,783 --> 01:28:29,651
Hey, you,
stay with your own!

969
01:28:30,351 --> 01:28:31,918
Run, Aurora, run!

970
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:33,720
Let him go!

971
01:28:38,359 --> 01:28:40,429
No! No!

972
01:29:07,556 --> 01:29:09,422
Godmother.

973
01:30:07,616 --> 01:30:09,449
For Flittle!

974
01:30:17,826 --> 01:30:20,361
We've got her!

975
01:30:34,943 --> 01:30:35,944
Huh?

976
01:31:07,008 --> 01:31:08,908
Go! Go!

977
01:31:08,910 --> 01:31:11,644
This way! This way!

978
01:31:11,646 --> 01:31:12,647
Go!

979
01:31:55,857 --> 01:31:57,158
Stand down!

980
01:31:58,994 --> 01:32:01,160
This is not my fight.

981
01:32:01,162 --> 01:32:03,798
My mother wanted a war,
and you're giving it to her.

982
01:32:05,634 --> 01:32:08,536
I won't allow her hatred
to ruin my kingdom or yours.

983
01:32:26,855 --> 01:32:28,690
There will be no Fey blood
on my hands.

984
01:32:50,645 --> 01:32:52,679
This way!
This way!

985
01:32:54,582 --> 01:32:56,651
Maleficent's back!

986
01:33:01,189 --> 01:33:03,758
She's going for the queen.

987
01:33:09,564 --> 01:33:11,564
Yield! Yield!

988
01:33:11,566 --> 01:33:12,699
Stand down!

989
01:33:12,701 --> 01:33:13,969
Lower your weapons!

990
01:33:26,214 --> 01:33:29,050
There's the evil
that I promised them.

991
01:33:32,721 --> 01:33:35,223
Your kind is more predictable
than humans.

992
01:33:41,863 --> 01:33:42,864
Stop!

993
01:33:43,765 --> 01:33:44,831
Stop!

994
01:33:44,833 --> 01:33:46,935
Well, almost.

995
01:33:47,202 --> 01:33:48,568
Stop.

996
01:33:48,570 --> 01:33:51,838
I'm sorry I doubted you,
but this isn't you.

997
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:53,806
There's another way.

998
01:33:53,808 --> 01:33:54,976
I know who you are.

999
01:33:57,612 --> 01:33:59,881
I know you.

1000
01:34:00,315 --> 01:34:01,981
You do not.

1001
01:34:04,252 --> 01:34:06,621
Yes, I do.

1002
01:34:07,088 --> 01:34:08,957
You're my mother.

1003
01:34:44,059 --> 01:34:45,293
No!

1004
01:35:01,109 --> 01:35:03,711
Do you know what makes a great
leader, Aurora?

1005
01:35:04,946 --> 01:35:08,147
The ability to instill fear
in your subjects...

1006
01:35:08,149 --> 01:35:09,416
and then use that fear...

1007
01:35:09,418 --> 01:35:10,618
Your Majesty.

1008
01:35:12,087 --> 01:35:14,320
...against your enemies.

1009
01:35:14,322 --> 01:35:17,090
So...

1010
01:35:17,092 --> 01:35:20,693
I spread the story
of the evil witch...

1011
01:35:20,695 --> 01:35:24,197
and the princess she cursed.

1012
01:35:24,199 --> 01:35:28,002
It didn't matter
who woke Sleeping Beauty.

1013
01:35:28,903 --> 01:35:31,003
They were all terrified.

1014
01:35:31,005 --> 01:35:34,109
And the story became legend.

1015
01:35:36,378 --> 01:35:39,078
I know you think
I'm a monster.

1016
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:44,052
But what I did to the king,
to Maleficent, to my son...

1017
01:35:44,886 --> 01:35:47,987
I did for Ulstead.

1018
01:35:47,989 --> 01:35:50,756
You are a traitor
to your kind,

1019
01:35:50,758 --> 01:35:52,360
and you will pay for it.

1020
01:35:53,395 --> 01:35:55,697
Maleficent is dead!

1021
01:35:58,700 --> 01:36:01,868
We will never again
live in fear!

1022
01:36:01,870 --> 01:36:03,271
Get back here!

1023
01:36:07,175 --> 01:36:09,443
Ulstead is free at last!

1024
01:36:09,445 --> 01:36:12,280
Let me go!

1025
01:36:20,955 --> 01:36:22,056
What's happening?

1026
01:39:47,629 --> 01:39:49,498
Well, well.

1027
01:39:50,466 --> 01:39:52,601
Hello, Beasty.

1028
01:40:11,319 --> 01:40:12,353
I missed you.

1029
01:40:14,155 --> 01:40:15,557
Did you bump
your head, then?

1030
01:40:16,157 --> 01:40:17,356
I did.

1031
01:40:20,261 --> 01:40:21,530
Philip.

1032
01:40:22,096 --> 01:40:23,432
Yes?

1033
01:40:25,299 --> 01:40:27,168
Do you love my daughter?

1034
01:40:30,171 --> 01:40:31,407
With everything I have.

1035
01:40:40,616 --> 01:40:41,949
Good.

1036
01:40:50,559 --> 01:40:53,662
I believe this belongs to you.

1037
01:41:00,436 --> 01:41:02,602
Curses don't end.

1038
01:41:02,604 --> 01:41:04,372
They're broken.

1039
01:41:29,698 --> 01:41:31,500
It ends.

1040
01:41:37,639 --> 01:41:40,172
There will be
no more fighting.

1041
01:41:40,174 --> 01:41:42,742
Ulstead will never attack
the Moors again.

1042
01:41:42,744 --> 01:41:44,178
And from this day on...

1043
01:41:44,813 --> 01:41:47,514
we move forward...

1044
01:41:47,516 --> 01:41:49,984
and find our way...

1045
01:41:51,052 --> 01:41:52,387
in peace.

1046
01:41:52,788 --> 01:41:54,355
Together.

1047
01:41:57,626 --> 01:42:00,427
Today,
there will be a wedding.

1048
01:42:00,429 --> 01:42:03,830
Not just a union
of two people...

1049
01:42:03,832 --> 01:42:07,166
but a union of two kingdoms.

1050
01:42:07,168 --> 01:42:08,570
And all are invited...

1051
01:42:09,638 --> 01:42:11,738
all are safe...

1052
01:42:11,740 --> 01:42:14,173
and all are welcome.

1053
01:42:48,242 --> 01:42:50,044
Hello, there.

1054
01:43:30,819 --> 01:43:33,920
We cannot live
amongst monsters...

1055
01:43:39,428 --> 01:43:42,564
Someone should
really cover those horns.

1056
01:43:59,615 --> 01:44:01,416
If only Conall could see you.

1057
01:44:03,552 --> 01:44:04,553
Borra...

1058
01:44:06,688 --> 01:44:09,355
it's time to come home.

1059
01:44:15,464 --> 01:44:16,765
Hello.

1060
01:44:18,433 --> 01:44:20,402
Can you come here?

1061
01:44:30,746 --> 01:44:31,880
Yes?

1062
01:44:33,815 --> 01:44:35,651
Will you give me away?

1063
01:44:35,951 --> 01:44:37,519
Never.

1064
01:44:38,654 --> 01:44:40,620
No.

1065
01:44:40,622 --> 01:44:42,189
Will you walk me
down the aisle?

1066
01:44:42,658 --> 01:44:44,358
Ah.

1067
01:44:46,695 --> 01:44:47,696
Yes.

1068
01:45:10,952 --> 01:45:13,320
Apologies to anyone
I might have mauled today.

1069
01:45:25,634 --> 01:45:26,635
Is that...?

1070
01:45:27,502 --> 01:45:29,336
She can change her back.

1071
01:45:30,005 --> 01:45:31,438
I suppose.

1072
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:35,608
Only if we wanted to.

1073
01:45:35,610 --> 01:45:37,276
Father.

1074
01:45:41,783 --> 01:45:44,050
I'm so glad to see you.

1075
01:45:44,052 --> 01:45:46,419
I've dreamed
of this moment.

1076
01:45:46,421 --> 01:45:49,321
Two kingdoms
united at last.

1077
01:45:49,323 --> 01:45:52,058
And it's because of you.

1078
01:45:52,060 --> 01:45:54,994
I'm so proud of you.
So proud.

1079
01:46:23,959 --> 01:46:25,525
She looks better
in green.

1080
01:46:25,527 --> 01:46:26,628
Pink, you mean.

1081
01:46:29,898 --> 01:46:30,999
No, in green.

1082
01:46:31,733 --> 01:46:32,799
Pink.

1083
01:46:32,801 --> 01:46:34,035
- Green.
- Pink.

1084
01:46:37,371 --> 01:46:38,805
Flittle!

1085
01:46:38,807 --> 01:46:41,042
It's perfect.

1086
01:47:25,554 --> 01:47:27,389
Let her go.

1087
01:47:40,902 --> 01:47:43,703
Pull yourself together.

1088
01:47:43,705 --> 01:47:46,906
We are here to join
two kingdoms...

1089
01:47:46,908 --> 01:47:48,610
divided by fear.

1090
01:47:49,511 --> 01:47:51,544
Today, you teach us

1091
01:47:51,546 --> 01:47:54,681
we are not defined
by where we are from...

1092
01:47:54,683 --> 01:47:56,852
but by whom we love.

1093
01:47:58,887 --> 01:48:00,555
The bands, please.

1094
01:48:16,137 --> 01:48:17,971
Do you, Philip,
take Aurora...

1095
01:48:17,973 --> 01:48:18,773
I do.

1096
01:48:20,675 --> 01:48:21,908
And do you,
Aurora, take...

1097
01:48:21,910 --> 01:48:23,610
I do.

1098
01:48:23,612 --> 01:48:27,480
Then I pronounce you
husband and wife.

1099
01:48:27,482 --> 01:48:29,517
You may kiss the bride.

1100
01:49:00,148 --> 01:49:01,247
You're smiling.

1101
01:49:24,139 --> 01:49:25,874
It's a new day.

1102
01:49:28,276 --> 01:49:30,045
It is.

1103
01:49:41,723 --> 01:49:42,757
Morning.

1104
01:49:43,658 --> 01:49:45,858
Will you stay awhile?

1105
01:49:45,860 --> 01:49:47,593
A little while.

1106
01:49:47,595 --> 01:49:49,629
