1
00:00:57,173 --> 00:01:00,009
We have killed Babylonians!

2
00:01:02,804 --> 00:01:05,640
<i>We have killed Mesopotamians!</i>

3
00:01:07,684 --> 00:01:10,019
<i>We have killed Assyrians!</i>

4
00:01:10,186 --> 00:01:11,688
Mycenaeans!

5
00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:13,606
Sumerians!

6
00:01:14,232 --> 00:01:15,566
But...

7
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:20,571
<i>...we have never had the pleasure...</i>

8
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:23,282
<i>...of killing...</i>

9
00:01:24,325 --> 00:01:25,743
...an Akkadian.

10
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,794
Which limb do I take first?

11
00:01:37,588 --> 00:01:39,924
May the gods have pity on you.

12
00:01:41,342 --> 00:01:44,679
Because my brother will not.

13
00:02:14,542 --> 00:02:15,543
Boo.

14
00:03:20,524 --> 00:03:21,859
You missed.

15
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:40,544
You're lucky we have the same mother.

16
00:03:49,553 --> 00:03:54,433
<i>Before the time of the pyramids,
a fearsome horde came from the east...</i>

17
00:03:54,517 --> 00:03:58,104
<i>...and swept across the barren lands
of the ancient world.</i>

18
00:04:09,198 --> 00:04:13,911
<i>By the law of the horde, their
greatest warrior was proclaimed their king.</i>

19
00:04:18,165 --> 00:04:20,501
<i>His name was Memnon.</i>

20
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:25,506
<i>He was the greatest swordsman
the world had ever seen.</i>

21
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:51,157
<i>With the predictions of a sorcerer, who
could foretell the outcome of every battle...</i>

22
00:04:52,116 --> 00:04:54,785
<i>...Memnon slaughtered
all who resisted him...</i>

23
00:04:59,123 --> 00:05:02,334
<i>...until only a brave few remained.</i>

24
00:05:16,223 --> 00:05:17,099
Silence!

25
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,685
My father has called for silence!

26
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,354
Hold your tongues!

27
00:05:29,403 --> 00:05:34,074
We are gathered in this place
to put our differences aside.

28
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,619
There is still time for us...

29
00:05:36,911 --> 00:05:39,079
<i>...the last of the free tribes...</i>

30
00:05:39,747 --> 00:05:42,875
...to stand together against this tyrant.

31
00:05:43,334 --> 00:05:46,003
With his sorcerer at his side...

32
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,589
...no mortal can defeat Memnon.

33
00:05:48,714 --> 00:05:51,884
And, if the sorcerer were to die...

34
00:05:53,093 --> 00:05:54,261
<i>...what then?</i>

35
00:05:54,345 --> 00:05:57,264
It's too late for your schemes, Pheron.

36
00:05:57,973 --> 00:06:02,978
I have raided Memnon's caravans,
broken the supply lines to his troops...

37
00:06:03,187 --> 00:06:06,273
...but he still swept across
the land like a plague.

38
00:06:06,523 --> 00:06:10,819
I will not send my people to their deaths
in a battle that can't be won.

39
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:13,906
And what people would that be, Balthazar?

40
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,742
<i>You are the ruler of nothing...</i>

41
00:06:17,201 --> 00:06:19,036
<i>...but a pile of rocks...</i>

42
00:06:19,411 --> 00:06:20,746
...and sand.

43
00:06:22,873 --> 00:06:24,291
If I am no king...

44
00:06:26,877 --> 00:06:28,837
...why are you on your knees before me?

45
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:30,714
Balthazar! Guards!

46
00:06:42,726 --> 00:06:46,480
Akkadians.
I thought they were wiped out long ago.

47
00:06:46,647 --> 00:06:49,066
They are the last of their kind.

48
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:52,653
By their hand, the sorcerer will die.

49
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:56,657
You put your faith in a clan of cutthroats
who kill for money?

50
00:06:56,782 --> 00:06:59,994
They are more than that.
They are skilled assassins...

51
00:07:00,202 --> 00:07:03,288
<i>...trained for generations
in the deadly arts.</i>

52
00:07:03,497 --> 00:07:08,002
What price do these mercenaries
ask from us, Father?

53
00:07:08,836 --> 00:07:10,671
Twenty blood rubies.

54
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,923
That's the last of our treasury.

55
00:07:13,007 --> 00:07:14,341
Be quiet!

56
00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:20,723
If these men kill the sorcerer,
will you fight?

57
00:07:34,528 --> 00:07:35,863
So be it.

58
00:07:37,948 --> 00:07:40,325
As long as one of us still breathes...

59
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:43,996
...the sorcerer will die.

60
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:49,710
Assassin!

61
00:07:55,132 --> 00:07:56,508
Him...

62
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,510
...we'll kill for free.

63
00:08:04,808 --> 00:08:07,895
We can reach
Memnon's encampment by nightfall.

64
00:08:09,146 --> 00:08:11,315
Why do you keep that filthy beast?

65
00:08:11,732 --> 00:08:13,901
He doesn't mean anything by it.

66
00:08:13,984 --> 00:08:15,444
Horses are faster.

67
00:08:15,611 --> 00:08:17,279
But camels are smarter.

68
00:09:05,285 --> 00:09:07,079
That one's mine.

69
00:09:07,621 --> 00:09:08,914
Live free.

70
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,000
Die well.

71
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,463
Stop! Listen to me!

72
00:09:16,547 --> 00:09:18,382
<i>I am a high priest of Set.</i>

73
00:09:18,632 --> 00:09:22,970
Spare me, and I shall bless thee
in five different languages.

74
00:09:23,553 --> 00:09:26,807
You will scream in five different languages,
horse thief!

75
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:27,808
Wait!

76
00:09:52,499 --> 00:09:54,084
I'm not that heavy.

77
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:24,906
Look out for the fat one! He's behind you!

78
00:10:31,663 --> 00:10:32,831
Help me!

79
00:10:32,956 --> 00:10:35,250
<i>Help me, whoever you are!</i>

80
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:37,544
Thank you, good sir.

81
00:10:37,627 --> 00:10:38,628
Quiet.

82
00:10:38,754 --> 00:10:41,506
There's an enormous reward
for my safe return.

83
00:10:58,857 --> 00:11:00,692
The sorcerer's tent.

84
00:11:11,953 --> 00:11:13,205
Back!

85
00:11:28,929 --> 00:11:30,138
That way!

86
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:32,182
Find the other one!

87
00:12:21,481 --> 00:12:23,650
You've been betrayed, Mathayus.

88
00:12:25,151 --> 00:12:26,653
You know my name?

89
00:12:27,362 --> 00:12:29,030
And why you're here.

90
00:12:37,455 --> 00:12:39,291
He's in the tent!

91
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:31,384
A living, breathing Akkadian.

92
00:13:31,885 --> 00:13:34,054
<i>This is a rare pleasure.</i>

93
00:13:38,183 --> 00:13:41,019
I hear you train yourselves
to bear great pain.

94
00:13:41,227 --> 00:13:44,230
You must teach me this,
if you live long enough.

95
00:13:57,077 --> 00:14:00,580
Not looking so full of yourself,
are you now, assassin?

96
00:14:00,997 --> 00:14:02,373
You...

97
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,418
Betrayed your own father!
Yes.

98
00:14:05,752 --> 00:14:07,837
He was very shocked.

99
00:14:08,088 --> 00:14:11,424
You could tell by the look on his face.

100
00:14:13,093 --> 00:14:14,719
<i>By my father's head...</i>

101
00:14:16,763 --> 00:14:18,556
...I pledge my allegiance.

102
00:14:18,848 --> 00:14:21,017
You have proven your loyalty, Takmet.

103
00:14:21,101 --> 00:14:23,144
This one still lives.

104
00:14:38,201 --> 00:14:39,327
Beautiful.

105
00:14:42,747 --> 00:14:44,249
<i>Bring him to me.</i>

106
00:14:51,506 --> 00:14:52,590
Mathayus.

107
00:14:55,969 --> 00:14:57,428
Live free.

108
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,309
Die well, my brother.

109
00:15:11,651 --> 00:15:12,902
So...

110
00:15:14,445 --> 00:15:16,239
...how shall this one die?

111
00:15:16,322 --> 00:15:18,408
He shall not die tonight.

112
00:15:18,491 --> 00:15:19,576
Really?

113
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:21,995
<i>We shall see.</i>

114
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:24,289
Nor shall he die by your hand...

115
00:15:24,706 --> 00:15:26,791
...or any hand you command.

116
00:15:33,298 --> 00:15:35,174
You have seen this in a vision?

117
00:15:35,258 --> 00:15:38,928
To ignore this would bring great misfortune.

118
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:42,140
<i>The gods show him favor on this night.</i>

119
00:15:42,348 --> 00:15:43,683
Just the gods?

120
00:15:50,356 --> 00:15:51,858
A puzzle, then:

121
00:15:53,067 --> 00:15:57,905
How to kill you without using my hand
or any hand I command.

122
00:16:20,219 --> 00:16:22,180
Fascinating, isn't it?

123
00:16:22,638 --> 00:16:26,476
This smoke, it causes the fire ants
to abandon their homes, you see?

124
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,403
All the sooner to feast on our naked heads.

125
00:16:38,613 --> 00:16:40,990
-You think that's funny?
-It's a little bit funny.

126
00:16:41,074 --> 00:16:45,328
You see, I am about to escape.
You, on the other hand, will die horribly...

127
00:16:45,411 --> 00:16:47,080
...for leaving me to die last night!

128
00:16:47,163 --> 00:16:48,998
So, what are you waiting for?

129
00:16:49,082 --> 00:16:50,875
You see that one up there?

130
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:55,004
<i>He's been drinking that yak piss for
an hour. And sometime very soon...</i>

131
00:16:55,755 --> 00:16:57,256
You see?

132
00:17:10,561 --> 00:17:12,939
Where's the horse thief?

133
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,178
All right, come on,
get me out of here.

134
00:17:46,472 --> 00:17:47,807
Do you...

135
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:49,642
...promise not to kill me?

136
00:17:50,434 --> 00:17:51,894
Yes, I promise.

137
00:17:51,978 --> 00:17:56,315
Remember, you are an Akkadian. You make
an oath, you always have to keep it.

138
00:17:57,066 --> 00:17:58,317
That's right.

139
00:17:58,818 --> 00:18:02,822
Promise to take me with you
and share in the spoils of your adventures.

140
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:04,991
What?

141
00:18:05,199 --> 00:18:07,535
All right, fine. Yes, I promise.

142
00:18:28,347 --> 00:18:30,349
All right. Now, hold still.

143
00:18:30,933 --> 00:18:32,268
<i>Here's one.</i>

144
00:18:32,852 --> 00:18:34,270
<i>That's a big one!</i>

145
00:18:34,562 --> 00:18:36,355
My, here comes the mother!

146
00:18:38,107 --> 00:18:39,942
So, where are we going?

147
00:18:40,026 --> 00:18:43,613
To Memnon's kingdom
to avenge my brother's death.

148
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,201
Never touch the bow.

149
00:18:49,285 --> 00:18:50,536
Not a problem.

150
00:18:52,371 --> 00:18:54,373
-Who are you calling?
-My ride.

151
00:19:02,048 --> 00:19:03,799
It's a nice camel.

152
00:19:07,303 --> 00:19:10,264
Not much room back here.
Scoot up, please.

153
00:19:12,224 --> 00:19:13,601
We had a deal!

154
00:19:13,726 --> 00:19:16,896
That's right. And I haven't killed you. Yet.

155
00:19:25,488 --> 00:19:28,074
What news from my sorceress today?

156
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:57,978
What news?

157
00:19:58,854 --> 00:20:01,690
Your armies will conquer in the west.

158
00:20:01,941 --> 00:20:05,361
Queen Isis' forces will
scatter to the four winds.

159
00:20:10,241 --> 00:20:13,119
Give the generals the news.
Have them make their armies ready.

160
00:20:13,202 --> 00:20:14,787
Yes, my lord.

161
00:20:29,385 --> 00:20:31,220
You think I'm cruel, don't you?

162
00:20:31,303 --> 00:20:34,557
Perhaps you've forgotten
what it's like outside these walls.

163
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,642
<i>Heartless, ignorant...</i>

164
00:20:36,976 --> 00:20:38,394
...and savage.

165
00:20:41,397 --> 00:20:43,315
But I can change that.

166
00:20:43,649 --> 00:20:46,652
<i>I will bring order after centuries of chaos.</i>

167
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:49,864
<i>An order which will last for 1,000 years!</i>

168
00:20:53,951 --> 00:20:56,412
Rivers of blood can never bring peace.

169
00:20:56,495 --> 00:20:58,664
But they can bring obedience!

170
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,292
<i>That will suffice for now.</i>

171
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,589
<i>And when I become the king of legend...</i>

172
00:21:08,007 --> 00:21:12,511
...then you shall take your place beside me,
on a throne...

173
00:21:13,345 --> 00:21:15,014
<i>...and in my bed.</i>

174
00:21:16,181 --> 00:21:17,683
But, my lord...

175
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:22,980
...in your bed,
I would lose my gift of sight.

176
00:21:24,064 --> 00:21:27,067
And you would lose your advantage in battle.

177
00:21:27,985 --> 00:21:32,489
The day I speak of
is the day I no longer need your vision.

178
00:21:40,915 --> 00:21:42,249
Gomorrah.

179
00:21:43,292 --> 00:21:48,213
After a hard day of looting and pillaging,
there is no greater city than Gomorrah.

180
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:50,507
Except maybe Sodom.

181
00:21:53,969 --> 00:21:55,638
I wish I could join you.

182
00:21:55,804 --> 00:21:57,222
You're not going?

183
00:21:58,223 --> 00:22:03,062
Believe me, I'd like to even the score
with a few of those red guards myself.

184
00:22:03,604 --> 00:22:07,941
But with the price they have on my head,
I'd never make it through the gates.

185
00:22:09,234 --> 00:22:11,153
I have faith in you, my friend.

186
00:22:11,236 --> 00:22:12,738
You'll get us in.

187
00:22:31,298 --> 00:22:35,302
You see? They've got the city sealed up
tighter than a crab's buttocks.

188
00:22:35,427 --> 00:22:38,722
I wish there was something
I could do to help, but I...

189
00:22:39,098 --> 00:22:40,349
But there is.

190
00:22:46,313 --> 00:22:48,357
What business do you have here?

191
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:50,692
I've come to collect a bounty.

192
00:22:52,277 --> 00:22:53,362
Horse thief.

193
00:22:53,445 --> 00:22:56,615
I know this dog.
They'll behead him for sure this time.

194
00:22:57,741 --> 00:23:00,077
He'll be all the prettier without it.

195
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:09,294
-What happened?
-You got us in. I knew you could do it.

196
00:23:09,461 --> 00:23:12,631
A jug of your finest wine
for my road-weary friend here.

197
00:23:13,132 --> 00:23:16,885
Wait a minute.
The last thing that I remember was...

198
00:23:16,969 --> 00:23:19,721
...this huge Akkadian fist
coming straight into my...

199
00:23:19,805 --> 00:23:21,432
Here's your wine, sir.

200
00:23:22,015 --> 00:23:25,018
Let me know if there's
anything else you'd like.

201
00:23:26,645 --> 00:23:29,148
It's good to be back in the big city.

202
00:23:29,815 --> 00:23:31,442
Watch my camel for me.

203
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:32,985
Gladly.

204
00:23:33,318 --> 00:23:35,320
Been working here long time?

205
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:37,948
How's the kabob?

206
00:23:48,834 --> 00:23:53,714
Merchandise, the highest quality.
Steel forged by the monks of Pompeii.

207
00:23:53,797 --> 00:23:58,594
The world's finest swords. You can't get
respect in Gomorrah without a quality blade...

208
00:23:58,677 --> 00:24:03,348
Birds of paradise! Birds of prey!
The most beautiful birds in the world.

209
00:24:04,057 --> 00:24:07,060
Hey, soldier, those big
muscles look cramped.

210
00:24:07,186 --> 00:24:10,522
-Perhaps one of us can help you relax.
-Maybe all of us.

211
00:24:39,551 --> 00:24:41,720
Mister! Guide, mister!

212
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:44,723
You need a guide to find
your way in Gomorrah.

213
00:24:47,392 --> 00:24:50,312
A good guide could show me
a way into Memnon's palace.

214
00:24:50,395 --> 00:24:55,400
But a smart guide wouldn't,
or he'd be shown into Memnon's dungeon.

215
00:25:10,832 --> 00:25:12,501
I don't have it!

216
00:26:14,604 --> 00:26:16,565
Do you want to earn this one?

217
00:26:28,326 --> 00:26:31,163
Get ready. I'll kill half, you kill half.

218
00:26:34,499 --> 00:26:36,835
All right. I'll kill them all.

219
00:26:37,169 --> 00:26:40,046
How about we go around them
and not kill anybody?

220
00:26:45,844 --> 00:26:48,180
Good Lord! Are you going to kill me?

221
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,848
Maybe later.

222
00:26:50,182 --> 00:26:52,809
Memnon's always threatened to have my head.

223
00:26:53,351 --> 00:26:55,937
Don't touch that.
What is it?

224
00:26:56,521 --> 00:26:59,149
That's my special magic powder.

225
00:26:59,524 --> 00:27:01,193
Magic powder?

226
00:27:01,651 --> 00:27:06,656
Yeah, magic powder. It's from a Chinese
formula that I procured at great expense.

227
00:27:07,574 --> 00:27:11,912
If I get the recipe right,
it'll move mountains.

228
00:27:12,037 --> 00:27:14,372
Clear roadways in an instant.

229
00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:17,876
Do great things, wonderful things.

230
00:27:19,961 --> 00:27:21,796
Or terrible things.

231
00:27:25,383 --> 00:27:28,053
Like all my inventions,
Memnon will use it for war.

232
00:27:28,136 --> 00:27:29,512
Where is Memnon?

233
00:27:30,555 --> 00:27:32,515
You mean to kill him, do you?

234
00:27:34,809 --> 00:27:35,769
Yes.

235
00:27:36,561 --> 00:27:39,981
In that case,
I'd say he was in the training courtyard.

236
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,890
No! Let me go!

237
00:28:58,393 --> 00:29:00,061
<i>I didn't do anything!</i>

238
00:29:04,816 --> 00:29:06,985
You know the penalty for thievery.

239
00:29:08,361 --> 00:29:09,404
No!

240
00:29:36,097 --> 00:29:37,432
No!

241
00:29:42,145 --> 00:29:43,938
Intruder!

242
00:30:03,541 --> 00:30:05,001
Follow me!

243
00:30:07,879 --> 00:30:09,005
You again.

244
00:30:09,172 --> 00:30:10,924
How do I get out of here?

245
00:30:11,549 --> 00:30:12,967
Through that door.

246
00:30:14,302 --> 00:30:15,470
What's that?

247
00:30:15,553 --> 00:30:17,472
That's one of my latest inventions.

248
00:30:17,555 --> 00:30:21,976
<i>It was meant to be a quick means of
transportation, but landing was a problem.</i>

249
00:30:23,269 --> 00:30:24,437
Open!

250
00:30:26,064 --> 00:30:26,856
<i>Open!</i>

251
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,650
Don't touch that, you'll set it off.

252
00:30:28,733 --> 00:30:29,817
Right.

253
00:30:49,087 --> 00:30:50,421
A man.

254
00:30:51,214 --> 00:30:52,465
What is this place?

255
00:30:52,548 --> 00:30:56,177
Memnon's harem.
But he visits so rarely.

256
00:30:56,261 --> 00:30:58,596
And it gets so lonely.

257
00:31:02,517 --> 00:31:04,185
Can't you leave me alone, Thorak?

258
00:31:04,269 --> 00:31:06,062
Watch your tongue, Philos.

259
00:31:06,604 --> 00:31:09,524
Careful with those!
They're delicate instruments.

260
00:31:09,607 --> 00:31:12,944
You're lucky Lord Memnon
has a taste for your science...

261
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:14,946
...you old fool!

262
00:31:17,865 --> 00:31:22,870
If I find out that you had anything to do
with this intruder, I will send the executioner.

263
00:31:25,873 --> 00:31:27,500
We know how to please.

264
00:31:28,418 --> 00:31:30,670
I'm sure you do, but...
Stay.

265
00:31:30,753 --> 00:31:33,798
Stay with us.
Now's not a good time.

266
00:31:33,881 --> 00:31:36,884
We will make your every fantasy come true.

267
00:32:08,207 --> 00:32:09,542
Kill him!

268
00:32:29,228 --> 00:32:30,688
After him!

269
00:32:46,829 --> 00:32:48,164
Go get him!

270
00:33:19,445 --> 00:33:22,532
Are you going to try to kill me
or just stare at me?

271
00:33:28,829 --> 00:33:29,956
Ow!

272
00:33:33,209 --> 00:33:34,710
Take a breath.

273
00:33:59,318 --> 00:34:00,903
Gods be praised!

274
00:34:05,741 --> 00:34:07,910
How dare you touch me?

275
00:34:12,248 --> 00:34:15,584
Sorceress, I am an Akkadian,
hired to kill you.

276
00:34:16,085 --> 00:34:19,672
I find myself in the position
where you are more use to me alive.

277
00:34:19,755 --> 00:34:21,757
Don't make me change my mind.

278
00:34:24,927 --> 00:34:29,932
And he said, "It's not the size of the hump,
it is the motion of the camel. "

279
00:34:39,275 --> 00:34:41,944
Alas, I must leave you now.

280
00:34:48,117 --> 00:34:49,660
There's the traitor!

281
00:34:49,869 --> 00:34:51,704
Great gods.

282
00:35:03,841 --> 00:35:08,179
He's dead!
Just admit it, you smelly camel.

283
00:35:09,972 --> 00:35:12,641
I am your master now! You belong to me!

284
00:35:12,975 --> 00:35:14,977
He is dead! Dead!

285
00:35:15,311 --> 00:35:16,479
Dead!

286
00:35:18,397 --> 00:35:21,067
You are alive! I knew it!

287
00:35:21,317 --> 00:35:22,651
Right.

288
00:35:23,652 --> 00:35:25,738
I was just saying to the camel:

289
00:35:25,821 --> 00:35:28,949
"Camel, no one could kill
our good friend Mathayus. "

290
00:35:29,784 --> 00:35:30,785
Get on.

291
00:35:30,868 --> 00:35:34,163
Why should I make it easy for you?
You're sworn to kill me.

292
00:35:34,246 --> 00:35:35,873
Others will die first.

293
00:35:38,501 --> 00:35:39,919
That's comforting.

294
00:35:41,796 --> 00:35:43,464
Who's your friend?

295
00:35:43,589 --> 00:35:45,049
Memnon's sorcerer.

296
00:35:45,758 --> 00:35:48,928
Memnon's sorcerer? Are you insane?

297
00:35:49,094 --> 00:35:50,971
She's going to get us all killed!

298
00:35:51,055 --> 00:35:54,183
Memnon must leave
the safety of his palace to get her.

299
00:35:54,266 --> 00:35:58,854
So you're going to use me first,
and then kill me. I feel so much better.

300
00:35:59,188 --> 00:36:02,316
I could do it the other way around
and kill you first.

301
00:36:02,525 --> 00:36:04,193
Where are we going?

302
00:36:05,277 --> 00:36:06,946
The Valley of the Dead.

303
00:36:07,029 --> 00:36:08,531
The Valley of the Dead?

304
00:36:08,614 --> 00:36:13,452
Nobody goes to the Valley of the Dead!
That's why they call it the Valley of the Dead!

305
00:36:14,703 --> 00:36:16,247
Wait for me, please!

306
00:36:25,548 --> 00:36:30,386
Take a dozen of your best men,
track him down, kill him...

307
00:36:32,263 --> 00:36:34,181
...and bring her back to me.

308
00:36:35,641 --> 00:36:37,643
Send me news when he's dead.

309
00:36:38,561 --> 00:36:40,145
Yes, my lord.

310
00:36:40,229 --> 00:36:41,689
My lord...

311
00:36:42,648 --> 00:36:46,151
...there are rumors spreading to the armies
that she is gone.

312
00:36:48,737 --> 00:36:49,822
Is this true?

313
00:36:49,905 --> 00:36:52,074
-It is, my lord.
-Then silence them.

314
00:36:52,741 --> 00:36:56,412
They must believe she is here,
if only for a short time.

315
00:37:03,085 --> 00:37:05,254
And when you find the Akkadian...

316
00:37:13,095 --> 00:37:14,847
...give him this from me.

317
00:37:20,102 --> 00:37:22,438
Are we where I think we are?

318
00:37:23,856 --> 00:37:24,857
Yes.

319
00:37:27,443 --> 00:37:28,610
Home.

320
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:13,614
Where are you going, sorceress?

321
00:38:24,374 --> 00:38:25,918
In a hurry to get back to Memnon?

322
00:38:26,001 --> 00:38:29,129
No, to get away from you!
I'll never go back to Memnon!

323
00:38:29,505 --> 00:38:32,174
He's kept me prisoner since I was a child.

324
00:38:37,596 --> 00:38:40,224
Why did you help me that night in the tent?

325
00:38:42,643 --> 00:38:45,813
I knew you were the one man
who could help me escape.

326
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,868
Run, if you like. But there are
worse dangers out there than me.

327
00:39:19,513 --> 00:39:21,723
What? You can't find it?

328
00:39:22,558 --> 00:39:23,892
It's around here somewhere.

329
00:39:23,976 --> 00:39:25,477
What are you looking for?

330
00:39:25,561 --> 00:39:27,896
Just a place to get out of the storm.

331
00:39:28,897 --> 00:39:30,399
What storm?

332
00:39:30,732 --> 00:39:32,317
You'll see.

333
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:42,828
Thorak.

334
00:39:43,829 --> 00:39:45,664
Memnon didn't come, did he?

335
00:39:46,081 --> 00:39:47,958
He sent his maggots to do his work.

336
00:39:48,041 --> 00:39:49,960
He's smarter than you think.

337
00:39:51,044 --> 00:39:52,713
Or more cowardly.

338
00:39:53,422 --> 00:39:55,382
Can I go home now?

339
00:39:59,303 --> 00:40:00,470
Stay here.

340
00:40:01,388 --> 00:40:02,848
Cover up.

341
00:40:02,931 --> 00:40:04,266
You'll be safe.

342
00:40:29,791 --> 00:40:31,918
He's attacking. Alone?

343
00:40:32,002 --> 00:40:34,171
The sun has fried his brain.

344
00:40:34,421 --> 00:40:37,257
1,000 duranas to the one
who brings me his head!

345
00:41:23,261 --> 00:41:25,013
Akkadian bastard!

346
00:41:27,891 --> 00:41:29,392
<i>Where is he?</i>

347
00:41:41,279 --> 00:41:42,614
<i>This way!</i>

348
00:41:47,244 --> 00:41:48,912
<i>You two first!</i>

349
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,874
Stay on the stones!

350
00:43:30,013 --> 00:43:31,514
Come with me.

351
00:44:04,381 --> 00:44:05,799
Don't touch that.

352
00:44:37,539 --> 00:44:38,832
Coward!

353
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:42,252
Show your face!

354
00:45:28,298 --> 00:45:29,632
The Akkadian.

355
00:45:39,642 --> 00:45:41,269
Mathayus!

356
00:46:17,805 --> 00:46:22,060
You are alive! You swatted them
like flies! You are invincible!

357
00:46:49,962 --> 00:46:52,382
Tell me, do you think you can save him?

358
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,760
His fever's high.

359
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:59,764
<i>The poison was made with scorpion venom.
If he does live...</i>

360
00:46:59,889 --> 00:47:03,559
...the blood of the scorpion
will always flow through his veins.

361
00:47:43,808 --> 00:47:45,226
Sorceress?

362
00:47:57,238 --> 00:47:58,906
It is a miracle.

363
00:48:00,408 --> 00:48:03,744
She cured you. I knew it! I felt her magic!

364
00:48:05,538 --> 00:48:09,542
<i>It almost killed her.
But, the gods, they were on our side.</i>

365
00:48:14,881 --> 00:48:18,718
Why? Why would you risk your life
to save mine?

366
00:48:19,802 --> 00:48:22,388
Because I believe you can save the people.

367
00:48:22,555 --> 00:48:24,557
The people are not my problem.

368
00:48:24,974 --> 00:48:26,309
Memnon is.

369
00:48:27,393 --> 00:48:30,062
You and the people have the same problem.

370
00:48:57,924 --> 00:49:00,885
Pardon, my lord. A message from Thorak.

371
00:49:04,096 --> 00:49:06,098
Finally, the Akkadian is dead.

372
00:49:12,939 --> 00:49:14,774
Something wrong, my lord?

373
00:49:16,275 --> 00:49:17,610
Not at all.

374
00:49:18,861 --> 00:49:20,571
Everything is in order.

375
00:49:21,155 --> 00:49:23,658
<i>In fact, things are going so well...</i>

376
00:49:24,116 --> 00:49:26,285
...that I'm moving up our plans.

377
00:49:27,286 --> 00:49:30,957
Tomorrow night, we feast
to celebrate our impending victory.

378
00:49:31,248 --> 00:49:34,835
And then we'll drive the last of the rebels
into the sea.

379
00:49:35,044 --> 00:49:36,379
<i>Now go.</i>

380
00:49:38,839 --> 00:49:40,257
My lord.

381
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:44,804
It is customary for the sorceress
to be present at these meetings.

382
00:49:45,388 --> 00:49:47,181
Why is she not here today?

383
00:49:47,306 --> 00:49:48,724
She is indisposed.

384
00:49:48,891 --> 00:49:50,893
It is nothing serious, I hope.

385
00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:53,229
If it were serious...

386
00:49:53,312 --> 00:49:55,398
...then you would know about it.

387
00:49:56,982 --> 00:49:58,317
Now go!

388
00:50:04,031 --> 00:50:05,366
She is alive.

389
00:50:05,825 --> 00:50:08,327
She is with him and he is coming here.

390
00:50:08,828 --> 00:50:10,162
Get ready.

391
00:50:23,384 --> 00:50:26,178
It works!

392
00:50:27,847 --> 00:50:32,351
<i>My lady, how lovely to see you out here
in this desolate place.</i>

393
00:50:32,685 --> 00:50:34,687
Let me show you. It works!

394
00:50:35,354 --> 00:50:37,356
<i>Come, come, come.</i>

395
00:50:37,857 --> 00:50:39,442
<i>My lady sorceress.</i>

396
00:50:42,862 --> 00:50:44,238
<i>You see?</i>

397
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:46,031
I worked it out.

398
00:50:46,699 --> 00:50:50,202
My Chinese formula. My magic powder works!

399
00:50:50,536 --> 00:50:53,205
<i>All I needed was salt, petered salt.</i>

400
00:50:53,706 --> 00:50:57,042
It was here all the time.
This place is just full of it.

401
00:50:57,376 --> 00:51:00,379
By the way,
do any of you happen to have any water?

402
00:51:09,054 --> 00:51:11,223
What do you think,
it is safe to drink?

403
00:51:14,226 --> 00:51:15,311
Not anymore.

404
00:51:15,394 --> 00:51:18,981
Delicious. You see, the sandstone must act
as a natural filter.

405
00:51:19,315 --> 00:51:20,316
Quiet.

406
00:51:27,239 --> 00:51:29,742
I'm alive! I'm alive!

407
00:51:33,412 --> 00:51:34,955
For the moment.

408
00:51:58,062 --> 00:51:59,230
Mathayus!

409
00:52:01,023 --> 00:52:02,191
Move.

410
00:52:15,579 --> 00:52:16,664
Assassin!

411
00:52:17,748 --> 00:52:19,500
<i>The gods are good to me.</i>

412
00:52:19,875 --> 00:52:24,880
When we last met, you offered to kill me.
Now I have a chance to return the favor.

413
00:52:25,297 --> 00:52:27,049
You are trespassers here.

414
00:52:27,216 --> 00:52:30,719
<i>Our survival depends
on this place being kept a secret.</i>

415
00:52:31,345 --> 00:52:34,640
So we have a problem,
as long as you're alive.

416
00:52:34,723 --> 00:52:37,309
No problem.
I can keep a secret like no other.

417
00:52:37,393 --> 00:52:40,688
In fact, I cannot remember how we got here.
We took a left turn...

418
00:52:40,771 --> 00:52:43,983
It's too late for that.
Balthazar!

419
00:52:44,733 --> 00:52:48,570
This place is sanctuary
for all of Memnon's enemies. You know that.

420
00:52:48,779 --> 00:52:51,740
-This man is dangerous!
-Your judgment is clouded.

421
00:52:51,824 --> 00:52:54,493
My judgment keeps all of you alive!

422
00:52:54,743 --> 00:52:57,413
This man cannot be
trusted and I'll prove it.

423
00:52:57,997 --> 00:52:59,623
Bring the woman to me!

424
00:53:04,128 --> 00:53:07,339
The first man to touch her
will have to come through me.

425
00:53:14,847 --> 00:53:17,349
I had hoped for nothing less.

426
00:54:29,046 --> 00:54:30,547
That's not fair!

427
00:54:51,443 --> 00:54:52,444
Get him!

428
00:54:57,991 --> 00:54:59,034
Go!

429
00:55:07,834 --> 00:55:08,877
Yeah!

430
00:55:15,425 --> 00:55:16,885
Do you yield?

431
00:55:16,969 --> 00:55:19,388
-Never!
-Then you're a fool.

432
00:55:19,846 --> 00:55:23,100
We're brothers in the same cause.
Brothers?

433
00:55:23,183 --> 00:55:27,187
You brought death to my people.
Memnon will follow you.

434
00:55:27,562 --> 00:55:29,815
He will come for his sorceress.

435
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:33,193
<i>Yes, I know who she is.</i>

436
00:55:33,485 --> 00:55:35,737
Memnon will stop at nothing
to see her return.

437
00:55:35,821 --> 00:55:40,826
He'll come swifter and deadlier once
he has her. Memnon will stop at nothing.

438
00:55:41,285 --> 00:55:44,955
Hide here as long as you can,
but believe me when I say he'll find you.

439
00:55:45,038 --> 00:55:49,626
And if he isn't stopped, he'll sweep
across this land and kill all of you.

440
00:55:52,254 --> 00:55:54,589
And who's going to stop him, Akkadian?

441
00:55:54,673 --> 00:55:55,632
You?

442
00:55:56,258 --> 00:55:59,302
Will you stand alone
before the fury of his armies?

443
00:56:03,265 --> 00:56:04,182
Yes.

444
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:29,291
A gentleman always lets a lady win.
Best two out of three?

445
00:56:31,126 --> 00:56:32,461
Dates?

446
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:34,838
Thank you.

447
00:57:22,177 --> 00:57:24,179
<i>Cassandra!</i>

448
00:57:58,588 --> 00:58:00,090
I've had a vision.

449
00:58:01,383 --> 00:58:05,554
Memnon will follow me here
and destroy these people.

450
00:58:06,137 --> 00:58:07,472
You know this?

451
00:58:16,398 --> 00:58:18,233
The things I see...

452
00:58:18,566 --> 00:58:20,819
...are like shimmers in a pond.

453
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:26,074
Some are certain and some remain shadows.

454
00:58:26,950 --> 00:58:28,618
<i>But I do know this:</i>

455
00:58:29,327 --> 00:58:33,331
Memnon will release his armies
and ride straight through this place.

456
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:36,042
Memnon will die by my hand.

457
00:58:43,341 --> 00:58:46,052
It seems the gods favor
me tonight, Akkadian.

458
00:59:03,278 --> 00:59:05,113
If you face Memnon...

459
00:59:06,364 --> 00:59:07,699
...you'll die.

460
00:59:10,368 --> 00:59:12,203
That is your destiny.

461
00:59:17,542 --> 00:59:19,544
I make my own destiny.

462
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:11,888
I need your help.

463
01:00:54,055 --> 01:00:56,391
Where do you think you're
going with my horse?

464
01:00:56,474 --> 01:00:57,433
To Gomorrah.

465
01:00:57,517 --> 01:00:59,477
Nothing we say will stop him.

466
01:01:00,228 --> 01:01:01,854
Without your sorceress?

467
01:01:01,938 --> 01:01:06,818
She returned to save the lives of your people.
I won't let her face Memnon's wrath alone.

468
01:01:06,901 --> 01:01:07,902
Step aside.

469
01:01:07,986 --> 01:01:10,738
Akkadian, you are riding to your death.

470
01:01:11,406 --> 01:01:13,241
If I let you ride alone...

471
01:01:17,579 --> 01:01:20,248
...what glory will there be left for me?

472
01:01:51,154 --> 01:01:53,156
This night we celebrate.

473
01:01:54,365 --> 01:01:55,533
Eat...

474
01:01:56,034 --> 01:01:57,869
...and drink your fill...

475
01:01:58,536 --> 01:02:01,372
...for tomorrow we ride into battle.

476
01:02:07,003 --> 01:02:10,340
I would have captured him myself,
but he ran like a coward.

477
01:02:10,631 --> 01:02:12,800
He left his bow behind.

478
01:02:15,887 --> 01:02:17,221
My lord...

479
01:02:18,473 --> 01:02:21,184
...there is something
troubling our soldiers.

480
01:02:22,310 --> 01:02:23,811
How distressing.

481
01:02:24,562 --> 01:02:25,688
Pray tell.

482
01:02:27,065 --> 01:02:31,235
It's been said
the sorceress is no longer by your side.

483
01:02:33,154 --> 01:02:35,490
Soldiers will fall prey to...

484
01:02:36,491 --> 01:02:38,242
...idle palace gossip.

485
01:02:38,826 --> 01:02:41,496
<i>You have my word, she is perfectly safe.</i>

486
01:02:41,829 --> 01:02:44,499
If the men are to fight, to die...

487
01:02:45,333 --> 01:02:47,418
...they may need more than that.

488
01:02:50,171 --> 01:02:51,672
You doubt my word?

489
01:02:51,798 --> 01:02:53,466
It is not that, sire.

490
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:57,095
It's just she is a symbol
from which the men derive courage.

491
01:02:57,178 --> 01:02:59,514
Symbols are most effective when seen.

492
01:02:59,597 --> 01:03:00,765
My lord.

493
01:03:07,939 --> 01:03:09,941
I am here at your request.

494
01:03:11,067 --> 01:03:12,652
<i>Pardon my absence.</i>

495
01:03:13,402 --> 01:03:15,238
I was not well.

496
01:03:16,697 --> 01:03:20,451
But our impending
victory has lifted my spirit.

497
01:03:21,702 --> 01:03:24,205
Is this sufficient to placate your men?

498
01:03:26,707 --> 01:03:28,876
Tell them what you see, sorceress.

499
01:03:34,090 --> 01:03:35,925
I see a great victory.

500
01:03:38,219 --> 01:03:41,889
Your enemies will reveal themselves to you.

501
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:52,275
Halt!

502
01:03:54,485 --> 01:03:55,987
What is in the cart?

503
01:03:56,404 --> 01:03:57,905
What is in the cart?

504
01:03:58,906 --> 01:04:02,076
<i>Actually, it is a bit of a surprise.</i>

505
01:04:04,078 --> 01:04:06,581
<i>A gift for tonight's festivities.</i>

506
01:04:06,998 --> 01:04:08,916
Prince Takmet's request.

507
01:04:10,418 --> 01:04:11,752
Very nice.

508
01:04:17,675 --> 01:04:18,843
Well, now.

509
01:04:19,302 --> 01:04:21,470
Let's see that pretty little face.

510
01:05:12,146 --> 01:05:13,981
Now go to my chambers.

511
01:05:14,482 --> 01:05:16,275
We have things to discuss.

512
01:05:21,530 --> 01:05:24,200
My sincerest apologies, my lord.

513
01:05:28,496 --> 01:05:30,164
I understand.

514
01:05:32,666 --> 01:05:35,503
You are fearful, weak.

515
01:05:42,343 --> 01:05:44,178
The feast is over.

516
01:05:44,470 --> 01:05:47,556
To bed, men, for tomorrow we conquer!

517
01:05:52,353 --> 01:05:54,063
Fortify the palace guard.

518
01:06:10,871 --> 01:06:13,040
All right, that was the easy part.

519
01:06:13,290 --> 01:06:15,793
-Everybody know what to do?
-Cripple the guards.

520
01:06:15,876 --> 01:06:17,253
Ignite the powder.

521
01:06:17,336 --> 01:06:19,130
And try not to get killed.

522
01:06:21,048 --> 01:06:23,134
What are you doing here? You could get hurt.

523
01:06:23,217 --> 01:06:24,510
So could you.

524
01:06:24,593 --> 01:06:26,053
Stay in the wagon.

525
01:06:27,721 --> 01:06:29,682
You watch yourself, Akkadian.

526
01:06:31,225 --> 01:06:33,060
No need for concern, miss.

527
01:06:33,144 --> 01:06:34,979
He's gonna pay for that.

528
01:06:43,237 --> 01:06:46,407
Seal the gates. Seal all the gates.

529
01:06:52,580 --> 01:06:55,249
Though I'm relieved to see you unharmed...

530
01:06:57,501 --> 01:07:00,004
...I am surprised the
Akkadian didn't kill you.

531
01:07:00,087 --> 01:07:02,590
He was after you. I was merely a pawn.

532
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:04,466
But you escaped his grasp.

533
01:07:04,550 --> 01:07:06,385
I'm not without my wiles.

534
01:07:08,053 --> 01:07:09,972
Yes, I'm well aware of that.

535
01:07:10,180 --> 01:07:11,515
<i>Bring them.</i>

536
01:07:18,105 --> 01:07:19,982
Tomorrow my victory is complete.

537
01:07:20,065 --> 01:07:23,569
That is your vision?
As I said, I have seen it.

538
01:07:24,028 --> 01:07:25,112
Have you?

539
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:29,450
I sense a change in you.

540
01:07:29,950 --> 01:07:31,785
<i>You seem somehow...</i>

541
01:07:33,454 --> 01:07:34,705
...diminished.

542
01:07:35,122 --> 01:07:36,790
I assure you...

543
01:07:37,291 --> 01:07:38,876
...I am myself.

544
01:07:39,126 --> 01:07:40,294
Good.

545
01:07:40,961 --> 01:07:43,881
A small demonstration
shouldn't trouble you, then.

546
01:07:59,647 --> 01:08:00,981
A simple test.

547
01:08:40,562 --> 01:08:41,814
Now go.

548
01:08:42,356 --> 01:08:44,024
<i>Everyone leave!</i>

549
01:08:58,205 --> 01:09:00,707
Where am I going?
Stop.

550
01:09:01,208 --> 01:09:04,545
It's over there. It should be just there.

551
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:17,975
Good man.

552
01:09:52,426 --> 01:09:53,760
Well, well.

553
01:09:55,929 --> 01:09:57,431
<i>What have we here?</i>

554
01:10:08,984 --> 01:10:10,319
One at a time!

555
01:10:23,457 --> 01:10:25,959
Six urns. Four cobras.

556
01:10:26,376 --> 01:10:27,711
Now...

557
01:10:28,295 --> 01:10:30,297
...let's see what you can see.

558
01:11:02,871 --> 01:11:04,122
Excellent.

559
01:11:05,165 --> 01:11:07,000
<i>One empty pot left now.</i>

560
01:11:14,216 --> 01:11:15,717
Who dies first?

561
01:11:34,194 --> 01:11:35,821
We're almost there.

562
01:11:45,038 --> 01:11:46,581
You know what I see?

563
01:11:46,915 --> 01:11:48,250
Fear.

564
01:11:50,043 --> 01:11:52,212
You have lost your power.

565
01:11:53,255 --> 01:11:55,257
Thrown it all away.

566
01:12:12,190 --> 01:12:14,443
What magic is this?
Mine.

567
01:12:15,110 --> 01:12:18,113
I see your fate, hollow king.

568
01:12:19,239 --> 01:12:21,074
And its time has come.

569
01:12:24,870 --> 01:12:27,539
Do you wish to test magic against steel?

570
01:12:40,427 --> 01:12:43,597
I've come for the woman and your head.

571
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:47,809
The assassin and the sorceress.

572
01:12:48,435 --> 01:12:50,103
How romantic.

573
01:12:51,229 --> 01:12:53,356
I'll bury you both together!

574
01:13:51,623 --> 01:13:53,124
And here it is.

575
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:55,835
The foundation stone.

576
01:14:21,736 --> 01:14:23,655
Hurry, we're running out of time.

577
01:14:23,738 --> 01:14:25,740
I'm hurrying! I'm hurrying!

578
01:14:58,481 --> 01:14:59,733
Fire in front.

579
01:15:00,066 --> 01:15:01,860
<i>Palace guard at your back.</i>

580
01:15:01,943 --> 01:15:04,654
Looks like I'll be keeping
my head after all.

581
01:15:17,834 --> 01:15:19,419
Kill the witch!

582
01:16:16,601 --> 01:16:18,019
Mathayus!

583
01:17:01,312 --> 01:17:03,147
For your father.

584
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:04,041
Die well, assassin.

585
01:18:37,742 --> 01:18:40,453
It seems the gods favor
me tonight, Akkadian.

586
01:18:51,923 --> 01:18:53,758
Mathayus!

587
01:19:17,448 --> 01:19:21,702
Hurry up and light it.
You hurry up. This is your invention.

588
01:19:27,792 --> 01:19:29,126
Follow me.

589
01:20:11,502 --> 01:20:13,587
Ready! Weapons!

590
01:20:50,166 --> 01:20:51,500
Attack!

591
01:20:58,966 --> 01:21:01,135
So much for not getting killed.

592
01:21:08,309 --> 01:21:09,643
Catch this.

593
01:22:19,213 --> 01:22:20,631
Hail to the king!

594
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:25,386
I knew it from the start.

595
01:22:25,469 --> 01:22:26,470
Hail!

596
01:22:27,054 --> 01:22:28,639
Mathayus!

597
01:23:01,839 --> 01:23:05,217
Stay here with us, Balthazar.
There's much work to be done.

598
01:23:05,342 --> 01:23:07,845
I have to look after my own people.

599
01:23:08,095 --> 01:23:09,513
You're a king now.

600
01:23:10,139 --> 01:23:11,807
<i>And a good one, I think.</i>

601
01:23:12,683 --> 01:23:16,353
Don't forget how you got here,
or the people you came from.

602
01:23:16,854 --> 01:23:19,106
My people will live on through me.

603
01:23:19,940 --> 01:23:23,277
Remember, there will always be
a place for you here.

604
01:23:24,194 --> 01:23:25,529
Live free.

605
01:23:26,530 --> 01:23:28,282
Rule well.

606
01:23:33,829 --> 01:23:38,667
Remember, Nubian eyes will be watching you,
Scorpion King.

607
01:23:43,380 --> 01:23:47,051
I see a time of great peace
and prosperity ahead.

608
01:23:47,801 --> 01:23:49,511
How is it you see this?

609
01:23:49,887 --> 01:23:53,098
Don't the legends say
you'll lose your powers if you...

610
01:23:55,225 --> 01:23:59,063
Can you think of a better way to keep
a king from taking advantage?

611
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:01,732
<i>Neither could my ancestors.</i>

612
01:24:03,317 --> 01:24:05,694
How long will this time of peace last?

613
01:24:08,739 --> 01:24:10,991
Nothing lasts forever, my king.

614
01:24:12,576 --> 01:24:15,913
And that is the destiny of all kingdoms.

615
01:24:16,747 --> 01:24:19,083
Then we'll make our own destiny.

616
01:24:23,747 --> 01:24:30,083
