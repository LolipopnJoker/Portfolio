1
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:25,812
Okay, there are two things that
I remember about my childhood.

2
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:29,482
I just don't remember it
being this orange.

3
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:33,069
First, I remember being with my dad.

4
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,321
He would get these
far-off looks in his eye,

5
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,823
and he would say,

6
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:40,117
"Life doesn't always turn out
the way you plan."

7
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:45,122
I just wish I'd realized at the time
he was talking about my life.

8
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:50,253
But that never stopped us
from taking our adventures together.

9
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,880
He would pack up
our sometimes-working car,

10
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:57,426
and he would tell me amazing stories
about strange and exotic lands

11
00:02:57,553 --> 00:03:02,765
as we headed off to exciting
destinations like Milwaukee.

12
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:06,853
It's amazing how exotic Wisconsin isn't.

13
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:09,772
But my favorite memories
were the stories

14
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:12,149
that he would tell me about my mom.

15
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:14,435
He would take me to the church
where they got married,

16
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:17,613
and I'd beg him to tell me more
about the ceremony

17
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,032
and about my crazy Uncle Irwin,

18
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:23,119
who fell asleep
in the macaroni and cheese.

19
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:28,541
And I asked my dad when he
knew that he truly loved my mom.

20
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,963
And he said to me, "Lucy,
your mother gave me a special gift.

21
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,382
"She gave me the world."

22
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:39,719
Actually it was a globe with a light in it.

23
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:43,264
But for the romantic that he was,
it might as well have been the world.

24
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:47,226
Well, the first time I saw him,

25
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:52,148
he didn't exactly give me the world.
It was a dollar-fifty train token.

26
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:55,651
But I looked forward to it
every single day.

27
00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:00,323
He started coming to my booth
between 8:01 and 8:15 every morning,

28
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:03,826
Monday through Friday,
and he was just perfect.

29
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,411
My Prince Charming.

30
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:11,459
Well, we've never actually spoken,
but I know someday we will.

31
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:13,836
I know it. I just know it.

32
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:17,798
And I know that someday
I will find a way to introduce myself,

33
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:20,760
and that's gonna be perfect.

34
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,179
Just like my prince.

35
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:33,522
$45 for a Christmas tree
and they don't deliver?

36
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:36,108
You order $10 worth of chow chow mein
from Mr. Wong's,

37
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,319
they bring it to your door.

38
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:42,865
I should've gotten the blue spruce.
They're lighter.

39
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,540
Lucy!

40
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:56,796
Nature of claim,
Christmas tree through window.

41
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,856
How am I gonna put that on my insurance?

42
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,633
They're still pissed
about the fire we had

43
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,843
when Joe Jr. Barbecued in the stairwell.

44
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:05,304
- I missed that one.
- Great sausage.

45
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:08,724
- Look, I'll pay for this.
- That's okay, Lucy.

46
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:12,228
My brother Julie's
in the glass business.

47
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:16,732
I almost forgot.
Merry Christmas.

48
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:19,568
Aw, Lucy.

49
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:22,488
You didn't have to do that.

50
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,073
Well, I wanted to.

51
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,908
I haven't even gotten
to my shopping yet.

52
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,243
Hey, Pop.

53
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:28,786
Can I give that bottle of Blue Nun

54
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,747
from cousin Ornella
to my probation officer?

55
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,874
Can't you see
we got some company?

56
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,170
- Say hello.
- Hello, Luce.

57
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,091
Nice...

58
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,638
Sweater.

59
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,932
- Thank you.
- It's over there.

60
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:59,233
Lucy, you're a nice girl.
Joe Jr.'s still single.

61
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,863
Yeah, it's a shocker.

62
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,535
What'll you have?

63
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,204
- The usual.
- What's that?

64
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,876
- Mustard, Coke.
- Lucy. Lucy, Lucy, Lucy.

65
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,836
- Hi, Jerry.
- I'm glad to find you here.

66
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,671
I was hoping you'd find me in Bermuda.

67
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:22,715
Bermuda?
That's good.

68
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,551
I am recommending you
for Employee of the Month.

69
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:26,969
The usual.

70
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:30,546
Really? I didn't know there was
an Employee of the Month.

71
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:31,807
Yeah.

72
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:35,728
"Supervisor Jerry Wallace
nominates Lucy Moderatz

73
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,813
"for Employee of the Month.

74
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,900
"Lucy is never tardy,
always works holidays,

75
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:43,444
"even if she has worked
the previous holiday.

76
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,279
"Just because she worked Thanksgiving,

77
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,573
"Lucy is willing to work Christmas, too."

78
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,326
Jerry, I'm not working Christmas.

79
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,449
You'll get a nice plaque
with the mayor's stamp on it.

80
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:56,499
- I didn't vote.
- You get to ride on a float.

81
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,063
- Saint Paddy's Day.
- I hate parades.

82
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,127
Did I mention extra holiday pay?

83
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:02,129
- I hate you.
- Lucy.

84
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:07,259
Look, Violet is sick
and Celeste can't switch

85
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,261
because she's got some big family thing.

86
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:12,264
And I promised my kids
I'd be there for them this year.

87
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:13,516
It stinks, Jerry.

88
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,893
I know it isn't fair,
and I can't make you do it.

89
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:19,897
But, Lucy, you're the only one...

90
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,524
Without family.

91
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:14,994
Come on, Richie.

92
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,211
Hi.

93
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:26,922
Merry Christmas.

94
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:40,019
Nice coat?
Merry Christmas to you, too?

95
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,396
You're beautiful. Will you marry me?

96
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,607
I love you.

97
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,446
- Hey.
- Nice coat.

98
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,448
It's Christmas.

99
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,410
I don't want any trouble. Whoa!

100
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,791
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

101
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,547
Somebody help me, please.

102
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:10,591
Sir? Sir? Sir?

103
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:14,720
Are you okay? Can you get up?
God, sir, this is not good.

104
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:20,809
Oh, God, mister...
Can you... Are you breathing?

105
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:24,563
Oh, God, you smell good.
Please wake up. Please, please.

106
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,273
Oh, God.
Can you wake up?

107
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,734
Can you hear me?

108
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:32,071
Oh, God.

109
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,573
Wake up. Somebody help me, please.

110
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:37,326
Mister?
Mister?

111
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,247
There's a train coming, and it's fast.
It's an express.

112
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:43,999
Oh, God.

113
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,846
Hi.

114
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:06,620
- All right, bring him down here.
- I need a doctor here.

115
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,483
Dr. Stevens, Dr. Jessica Stevens...

116
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,026
Hi, excuse me.

117
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,995
About two seconds ago,
a man was brought in...

118
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,519
- What's his name?
- I don't know it.

119
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:16,648
- I need to know his name.
- He's right there.

120
00:10:16,732 --> 00:10:18,950
You don't know his name?
Why don't you...

121
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,036
- You can't go in.
- You can't go in there.

122
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,205
- You don't understand.
- You family?

123
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,257
- Family only.
- No, you don't understand.

124
00:10:25,341 --> 00:10:27,075
- I was...
- You wait there.

125
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,130
Okay, guys, what do we got here?

126
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,385
I was gonna marry him.

127
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,721
Get Dr. Rubin
or Dr. Ortiz here.

128
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,984
Dr. Memrack to ICU West.

129
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,153
Come on, come with me.
Over here.

130
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,038
- Let him hear your voice, hon.
- Okay.

131
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:11,628
Hi.

132
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:19,887
Everything is gonna be okay. I know it.
It's gonna be fine.

133
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:21,180
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

134
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:22,973
Is that the woman that saved his life?

135
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:24,558
Yeah.

136
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:28,979
It gets even better than that.
She's his fiancée.

137
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,528
Excuse me, ma'am.

138
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,697
I'm sorry, but I need to ask you
a few questions.

139
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:40,324
- Okay.
- Officer, may I interrupt you?

140
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,576
- Sure. I'll be right over there.
- Thank you.

141
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,370
- I'm Dr. Rubin.
- Hi, I'm Lucy.

142
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,455
Don't tell me about passes.
Where the hell is he?

143
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:50,042
- Dad, don't embarrass me.
- He's so pale. Oh, my God.

144
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,378
- What is this?
- This is my son. How is he?

145
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:55,014
You can't come
bursting into this unit.

146
00:11:55,098 --> 00:11:58,175
- He'll be all right, right? Right?
- What happened? What's going on?

147
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,260
- He's in a coma.
- On Christmas Day.

148
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:01,387
Jesus.

149
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:04,398
His vital signs are strong,
his brain waves are good.

150
00:12:04,482 --> 00:12:07,142
- Brain waves?
- He's going to get through this.

151
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,353
- Are you a specialist?
- How did this happen?

152
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:13,190
He was pushed from the platform
at the train station.

153
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,527
Who's she?

154
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:19,071
- She's his fiancée.
- His fiancée?

155
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,864
- Yeah.
- Peter's fiancée?

156
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:22,533
- Peter's engaged?
- Yeah, I thought...

157
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:25,244
No, no, you don't understand.

158
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,048
I mean,
he would have told us, right?

159
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:28,247
Maybe he was busy.

160
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,411
Too busy to tell his own mother
he's getting married?

161
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,543
- Don't yell at him.
- I'm not yelling at him.

162
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,337
- If only Jack were here.
- Grandma?

163
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:38,382
- Is she okay?
- She's got a little heart problem.

164
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,092
She's had three attacks already.

165
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,678
They weren't attacks.
They were episodes.

166
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,974
- Nothing wrong with her hearing.
- Excuse me, Doctor.

167
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:48,642
What is she doing in here?

168
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:51,061
Hey, buddy, she saved his life.

169
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,188
You saved his life?

170
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:54,815
Yeah, yeah, but...

171
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,151
I thought he was pushed
off a train platform.

172
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,027
She jumped on the tracks.

173
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,196
You jumped on the tracks?

174
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,533
Doctor, it's supposed to be family only.

175
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:08,212
- She is family.
- She's the fiancée, you idiot.

176
00:13:08,296 --> 00:13:11,039
- Look, I'm sorry, you don't understand.
- I'm awfully sorry.

177
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:14,418
We haven't seen him for a long time,
so we didn't know.

178
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,713
I always wanted him to find a nice girl.

179
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:21,091
I'm so glad he found you.

180
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,555
Peter.

181
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:35,772
- Why did you say that?
- Say what?

182
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:38,400
- I'm not his fiancée.
- Why did you tell me that you were?

183
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,611
I'm not engaged.
I've never even spoken to the guy.

184
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:44,239
What? But downstairs you said...
You said you were gonna marry him.

185
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:47,034
I was talking to myself.

186
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:49,203
Well, next time you talk to yourself,

187
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:51,747
tell yourself you're single
and end the conversation.

188
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:55,000
- What am I gonna do?
- I don't know.

189
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:58,670
She held me so tight.
You know, I couldn't tell her.

190
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:01,256
- I know.
- Excuse me, nurse.

191
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:04,301
- Is there a pharmacy in the hospital?
- What do you need?

192
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,720
Elsie, she wants nitroglycerin.

193
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,388
For her heart problem?

194
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:09,723
Problem?

195
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,266
Problems.

196
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:14,311
You know something,
I think you saved her life.

197
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:16,939
In fact, I think you saved
the whole family.

198
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,149
Bless you.

199
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:22,261
Why don't you come with me?
I'll take you down there.

200
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:49,054
So,

201
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,890
tell us how you met Peter.

202
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,893
Ma, she doesn't wanna
talk about that now, okay?

203
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:56,729
Why not?
Could use a nice story.

204
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,273
- How do you know it was nice?
- Of course it was nice.

205
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:00,732
Why shouldn't it be nice?

206
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,318
What about that other girl?
The one he met in the bar.

207
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,612
What's that got to do
with the price of eggs?

208
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:08,490
- Ashley Bartlett Bacon.
- Ox.

209
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,534
All I know is
she was pretty high and mighty

210
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,869
for someone named after breakfast meat.

211
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:15,163
Well, he has a nice girl now.

212
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,374
So did you steal him from Ashley?

213
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:21,169
I bet it was love at first sight. Right?

214
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:23,422
I have a sense about these things.

215
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,966
- Elsie, let her tell it.
- She is telling it.

216
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,344
I bet that he picked you up
in that fancy car of his...

217
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,306
What was it about him that,
you know, first struck you?

218
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:35,851
- It was his, smile.
- They're caps.

219
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,604
Six hundred bucks a tooth.

220
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:44,651
Well, we saw each other

221
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:48,447
and, he smiled.

222
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:50,490
And...

223
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:55,537
And I knew that my life
would never be the same.

224
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:58,790
So...

225
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,381
- Tomorrow night, 8:00.
- What?

226
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:11,803
I got Ice Capades. I know a guy.

227
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,503
Hi.

228
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:42,185
Bet you're wondering what I'm doing
here in the middle of the night?

229
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:46,481
Well, I thought
I should introduce myself.

230
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,025
My name's Lucy.

231
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,236
Lucy Eleanor Moderatz.

232
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:56,867
Think you should know
your family thinks we're engaged.

233
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:01,872
Never been engaged before.
This is all very sudden for me.

234
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:12,007
What I really came here to tell you
was that

235
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:16,052
I didn't mean for this to happen.

236
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,514
I don't know what to do.

237
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:26,062
I mean, if you were awake,
I wouldn't be in this mess.

238
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:28,940
Oh, God.
Not that I'm blaming you. Sorry.

239
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:32,110
It's just that, you know,
when I was a kid,

240
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:37,282
I always imagined what I would be like,

241
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:41,787
or where I would be,
or what I would have when I got older.

242
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:43,474
And, you know, it was the normal stuff.

243
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,708
You know, I'd have a house and family
and things like that.

244
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:49,586
You know, not that I'm complaining
or anything,

245
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,963
because, you know, I have a cat.

246
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,382
I have an apartment.

247
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:59,012
Sole possession of the remote control.
That's very important.

248
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:00,931
It's just...

249
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:06,019
I never met anybody
that I could laugh with, you know?

250
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:15,070
Do you believe in love at first sight?

251
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:19,574
No, I bet you don't.
You're probably too sensible for that.

252
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,371
Or have you ever, like, seen somebody,

253
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:29,918
and you knew that if only that person
really knew you, they would...

254
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,921
Well, they would of course dump
the perfect model that they were with

255
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:37,926
and realize that you were the one
that they wanted to just grow old with.

256
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:50,856
Have you ever fallen in love with
somebody you haven't even talked to?

257
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,948
Have you ever been so alone you spend
the night confusing a man in a coma?

258
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,571
Brian Lynch.

259
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,657
Mr. Brian Lynch,
please call Amber Lynch at 2617.

260
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:48,538
Oh, my God.

261
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:55,337
Bye.

262
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,884
- Lucy. We didn't know you were here.
- Hi.

263
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,302
- Hi.
- Hi.

264
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,137
- Were you here all night?
- Yeah.

265
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:07,682
You're like me.
I could always sleep anywhere.

266
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:10,602
And believe me, she has.

267
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,355
Way to go, Gram.

268
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,148
So how's Peter?

269
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,400
Well, he's got more color.

270
00:21:17,426 --> 00:21:19,319
He has some color.
Looks like he has some color.

271
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,528
Yeah.

272
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:23,657
Well, I have to go,
so it was great to see you guys again.

273
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:26,034
- Why don't you tell her? Go on, tell her.
- Yeah.

274
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:29,955
We didn't get to celebrate Christmas,

275
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,707
so it would be nice if you could join us.

276
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:37,671
I would love to, but I can't.

277
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:41,549
- Jack's gonna be there.
- That's right. You haven't met Jack yet.

278
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:46,012
- No, not yet.
- He'll be so happy to meet you.

279
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:47,138
So you'll come tonight?

280
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,683
I really shouldn't,
because I have to work. I can't.

281
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:52,811
Look, here.
Put your phone number and address there.

282
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:54,688
Midge'll call you and talk you into it.

283
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,022
Okay.

284
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,308
Here's another card
for when you change your mind.

285
00:21:58,392 --> 00:22:00,276
We're in the estate-furniture business.

286
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:02,404
We buy furniture from dead people.

287
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:08,535
Okay. All right, well, I have it, so bye.

288
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:10,620
- Bye, dear. See you later.
- Bye.

289
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:15,075
- Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am.
- What? What is this?

290
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:17,544
I'm sorry, Mrs. Callaghan.
These are your husband's things.

291
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:19,129
He's not my husband.

292
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:21,631
I'm sorry. Your fiancé.

293
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:28,722
You're Peter's fiancée?

294
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,684
- Okay.
- Dalton Clarke.

295
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:35,437
Colleague of Peter's
at Lubel, Parker, Jacobs and Fink.

296
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:38,815
- I have to go now.
- He's a great guy.

297
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:40,233
He's had a tough year.

298
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,193
What with the accident
last month and all.

299
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:47,073
- Accident?
- Well, of course it was an accident.

300
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:50,326
I mean, it wasn't my...
Did he tell you it was my fault?

301
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:54,956
We're playing basketball, all right?
I carry a pencil. I'm a lawyer, I do that.

302
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,750
- Okay.
- Jesus, what's he...

303
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,585
It's gonna be okay.

304
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,879
So, what's the big deal?

305
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:04,632
What's the big deal? Jerry, they
think I'm their future daughter-in-law.

306
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,597
And the grandmother,
she's got this heart thing.

307
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:09,179
If I tell the truth, she's gonna have
a heart attack and die,

308
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:10,472
and it's gonna be on my head.

309
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:12,640
Well, then, go along with it.

310
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,809
And when Peter comes out of the coma,

311
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:18,605
the family will be so happy,
they won't care that you lied to them.

312
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:20,815
They'll probably even thank you for it.

313
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,817
Just mustard.

314
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,738
Okay, what if he doesn't
come out of his coma?

315
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,531
Well, then who's to know?

316
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:30,992
- I don't know.
- Now, look, look. Lucy.

317
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:34,037
When my mother found out
I was getting married to my wife,

318
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,830
her intestines exploded.

319
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:37,707
- Oh, my God.
- Now, you tell them now,

320
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:40,001
you might as well shoot Grandma.

321
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:47,509
Come on, Mel. Mel...
Psst, psst, psst!

322
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,026
What am I doing?

323
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,112
Lucy.

324
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,030
- Hi, Saul. Hi.
- You made it?

325
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:53,741
- Yeah.
- How do you feel?

326
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:55,660
Okay. Okay.

327
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:58,746
Come on, keep me company for a while.
I don't like to smoke in the house.

328
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,966
- Listen, you want one?
- I'm trying to quit.

329
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,959
That's good.

330
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:04,919
Here, sit down.

331
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,755
They don't bother you, do they?

332
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,799
No, no, I'm fine.

333
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,844
Did you know
that I was Peter's godfather?

334
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:15,388
Really?
I thought you had to be Catholic for that.

335
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,432
Ox fudged it over.

336
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:20,518
He donated 50 folding chairs
to Father Shea's bingo night.

337
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:24,939
You know, being a godfather
is very important to Catholics.

338
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:28,026
It means you're practically
part of the family.

339
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,944
Well, you're lucky.

340
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:33,573
It's really important to have family
around this time of year.

341
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:36,242
Are you...

342
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,703
I mean, are your parents with you?

343
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,331
No, no.
My mom died when I was really young.

344
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:43,917
And a couple years ago, my dad got sick.

345
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:47,879
And we moved from Indiana to Chicago
so he could go to a research hospital.

346
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,255
Research.

347
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:52,675
A medical term for "very expensive"?

348
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:57,764
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. I had to quit school
and then I started working for the CTA.

349
00:25:57,848 --> 00:25:59,891
And about a year ago,

350
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,268
he decided he had had enough research,

351
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:04,229
and he passed away.

352
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:09,317
My wife of 51 years passed away
two years ago, February the 9th.

353
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,735
I'm sorry.

354
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,320
Yeah, it was a rough time for me.

355
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,198
- Yeah.
- But Ox got me through.

356
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:17,825
- You're good friends?
- The best.

357
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:23,373
Lucy, the Callaghans...

358
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:26,334
Well, they took me in
as part of their family.

359
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:29,754
I'd never let anyone hurt them.

360
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,424
Neither would I.

361
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:36,970
I believe you wouldn't.

362
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:39,973
Lucy?
You came?

363
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:43,351
Hi, Saul. This is great.
Okay, come on in, you two.

364
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:46,854
It's freezing out here.
Elsie made her eggnog.

365
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:49,774
- Word to the wise, drink soda.
- Okay.

366
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:52,860
Ox, Mom, look who's here.
Lucy came.

367
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:55,113
What a surprise.

368
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:58,866
- Hi, Mary.
- Come on in. It's cold out there.

369
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,410
Oh, sweetheart.

370
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:02,620
We've got the most wonderful dinner.

371
00:27:02,705 --> 00:27:03,830
It smells so good.

372
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:04,956
Hi.

373
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,875
This is so beautiful.

374
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:17,093
- That's Peter on the right.
- He's so sweet.

375
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,428
Yeah, the squirrels.

376
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:20,138
Eggnog, everyone.

377
00:27:21,432 --> 00:27:23,474
Ma, where are you?
I'm serving your eggnog.

378
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,435
I'm getting my camera.

379
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:27,603
Come on, everybody.
Get close to the tree.

380
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:29,397
Christmas pictures.

381
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,065
- Lucy, come on.
- Come on, Lucy.

382
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,026
- Let's go.
- I...

383
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:38,031
Watch the birdie.

384
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,091
Ma, take it again.
I blinked.

385
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,744
You're lucky. I'm blind.

386
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:44,746
Yeah, I love it.

387
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,415
- Excuse me.
- I don't drink anymore.

388
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:50,793
I don't drink any less either.

389
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:53,671
- Perhaps I should.
- You got me on that one.

390
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:55,298
Look at this.

391
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,216
More presents.
I'll take these two.

392
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:59,385
- What is this?
- Open it.

393
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:02,347
- What is that?
- Turn them over.

394
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:04,057
Pierced?
Really?

395
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,725
Oh, my God, thank you.

396
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:08,019
- We'll go to Wal-Mart on Monday.
- Thank you.

397
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,813
Don't thank me. If it was up to me,
I would've gotten you a Barbie.

398
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:13,285
- Did you like that?
- More presents.

399
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:16,110
- We hit the jackpot.
- Mom, this is for you.

400
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:19,155
"To Ox, from Uncle Al."

401
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,573
Who the hell is Uncle Al?

402
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,300
Uncle Al.
You know, Uncle Al from Buffalo.

403
00:28:22,384 --> 00:28:23,784
- You remember Al.
- Uncle Al?

404
00:28:23,844 --> 00:28:25,887
To Lucy, from Santa.

405
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,664
- You remember Uncle Al.
- Remember Al? He was here.

406
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:30,416
Yeah, that Uncle Al.

407
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:32,960
That was
a real good Christmas.

408
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:35,880
Seven bow ties, I bet.

409
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,883
- You shouldn't have.
- That's right, she made these.

410
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:48,184
The gold watch.
I love it.

411
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:51,479
Sweetheart, it's so expensive.

412
00:28:51,814 --> 00:28:54,315
Gram, these are so great.
Thank you.

413
00:28:57,528 --> 00:28:59,445
They're so pretty.

414
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,865
You remember Uncle Al,
don't you?

415
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:06,119
No. Yeah, yeah.
Well, he wasn't really uncle.

416
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:08,523
- I never got him anything.
- He had this moustache.

417
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:10,373
He was Daddy's friend, right?

418
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:12,542
- I know an Uncle Ed.
- No, Uncle Al.

419
00:29:17,131 --> 00:29:18,697
This is Callaghan.

420
00:29:18,782 --> 00:29:20,967
Leave a message
and I'll get back to you. Ciao.

421
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,636
Hi, it's Ashley.

422
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,973
Lisbon is absolutely gorgeous,
but I'm cutting my trip short,

423
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:29,684
because I have been doing
a lot of thinking,

424
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:31,727
and what the hey,

425
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:33,438
I will marry you.

426
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,344
Jack.

427
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:06,971
- Hey.
- Hey, buddy.

428
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,226
Don't wake Lucy.

429
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:16,314
Who's Lucy?

430
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:18,941
Lucy's Peter fiancée.

431
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:22,153
No, that's not Peter's fiancée.

432
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,030
You haven't met her?

433
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:25,698
No.

434
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:28,117
Well, she's great.
You're gonna love her.

435
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:31,704
You know what, kid?
Maybe I'll stay the night.

436
00:30:32,214 --> 00:30:33,831
Don't eat my cereal
in the morning.

437
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:35,500
So it's Mary's special cereal.

438
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:38,127
Last time you took
the toy surprise, remember?

439
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:09,075
Good morning.

440
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:10,618
Oh, God.

441
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:14,038
- You scared me.
- Sorry.

442
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:17,124
Good morning, Jack.

443
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:20,670
I guess I don't remember meeting you.

444
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:24,006
Well, it's probably because
we've never met.

445
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:27,009
That might have something to do with it.

446
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:36,769
Cab. I have to go.
I'm really late, because I have to go.

447
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:40,565
But it was nice to meet you, Jack.
So bye.

448
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,735
- Lucy.
- Okay, look.

449
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,862
- I know that I...
- Hey.

450
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:51,075
Welcome to the family.

451
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:53,995
Thank you.

452
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:57,707
Bye.

453
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:05,798
We pray that the Lord's healing presence

454
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:09,719
will be felt by those who are sick
and by their families.

455
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:13,931
Especially Jo-Jo Goreki,
Peter Callaghan,

456
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:16,559
Craig Little and Peggy Dunne.

457
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:19,353
We pray to the Lord.

458
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,016
- Lord, hear our prayer.
- Lord, hear our prayer.

459
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:25,735
O, God, you call us to live as one family.

460
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:28,362
- Save us from...
- So who's this Lucy?

461
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:31,032
She's your brother's fiancée.

462
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:35,036
You'd think
if Peter were getting married,

463
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,163
he would have announced it
in the Tribune.

464
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:40,166
- We read the Sun Times. Amen.
- Amen.

465
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:43,085
So why did she sneak out this morning?

466
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,462
She has a job.

467
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:46,839
I like Mass better in Latin.

468
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:49,675
It's nicer when you don't know
what they're saying.

469
00:32:50,344 --> 00:32:53,095
- Did you get the Bourbeau estate?
- Got it.

470
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,306
- What about Downey's?
- Got it.

471
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,183
- Himmelstein's?
- Yeah.

472
00:32:57,309 --> 00:33:00,227
- Did you get Van Allan?
- Himmelstein's took too long.

473
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:03,648
- For Chrissake, Jack.
- Stop swearing.

474
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:05,858
Look, you're running the business now.

475
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,610
There's something I'd like to talk about.

476
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:10,071
- Talk about that later, okay?
- Talk about it now.

477
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:13,240
- He can't kill you in church.
- Will you please pipe down?

478
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:15,284
Hey, be nice, pally. We're in church.

479
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:17,912
- You're disrupting the Mass.
- Who made you the pope?

480
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,246
Ox.

481
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:21,916
How did Joe Kelly get to be a lector?

482
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,751
He takes marijuana.

483
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:24,919
Amen.

484
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:04,375
- Hi, Luce.
- Hi, Lucy.

485
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:05,710
Hi, Lucy.

486
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:26,731
Come on, you stupid wing nut.
Your mother's...

487
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:42,997
Excuse me, do you live here?

488
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:47,168
Live here?
I own this place.

489
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:54,008
Great. Well, then you would know
the woman that lives in 201.

490
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:57,178
Know her?
I'm dating her.

491
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:37,968
Very clean.

492
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,847
Kitty?

493
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:48,020
Kitty?
Rich kitty?

494
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:51,524
Come here. Mealtime.

495
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:56,445
Kitty, kitty, kitty. Kitty, kitty, kitty.

496
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,907
Kitty.

497
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:03,452
Kitty?

498
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:10,793
Food. Kitty, kitty, kitty. Come here.

499
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:14,839
Come here. Come on, honey.
Where are you?

500
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:23,138
I'm so sorry.

501
00:36:23,557 --> 00:36:24,640
Nice shot.

502
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:31,814
I'll get you some ice. I'm sorry.
I wasn't expecting anybody.

503
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,732
Hey, how'd you get in here?

504
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,528
Key?

505
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,238
Key.
You stay here a lot?

506
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,532
You know, feed the cat.

507
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:44,827
Peter doesn't have a cat.

508
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:57,339
Hello.
Hello, honey.

509
00:36:57,424 --> 00:37:00,885
Fluffy.
Hello, Fluffy.

510
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:03,137
You must be so hungry.

511
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,851
Are you gonna get that?

512
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:12,730
No, I'm gonna let the machine get it.

513
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:19,153
Hello?

514
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,034
It's for you.

515
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,085
Hello.

516
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:40,382
Okay. Bye-bye.

517
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:43,594
That was the hospital.

518
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:47,681
They say it's customary for friends and
family to come down and give blood.

519
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:50,434
Let's go together.

520
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:58,233
You know what?
I think maybe we should take your truck.

521
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:01,278
No, we ought to take Peter's car.

522
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:02,613
Okay.

523
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:04,384
You know where it's parked, don't you?

524
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:07,034
Yeah, I... Yeah.

525
00:38:14,668 --> 00:38:17,378
Hey, we'll have to get
your picture for the mantel.

526
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:20,339
- Of me?
- No, of you and Peter.

527
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,841
I'm not that photogenic.

528
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:24,593
I doubt that.

529
00:38:24,678 --> 00:38:28,180
All right, now, I want you to sit here
and sip this or you'll get woozy.

530
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:29,890
When did you start seeing Peter?

531
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:31,809
September 17th.

532
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:36,105
- Three months. That's quick.
- You have no idea.

533
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:38,774
- That's fast. That's...
- Miss.

534
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:39,900
I'm fine.

535
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:42,444
- That's a fast engagement.
- Wait, I'm not finished.

536
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:44,538
I got it. I got it. I got it.

537
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:52,413
What the hell's he got a TV for?
He's in a coma for Chrissakes.

538
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:54,832
Ox. You know, he might hear you.

539
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:57,084
Then get him a radio.

540
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,752
Maybe he'd like us to sing to him.

541
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:01,380
Maybe Lucy knows his favorite song.

542
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:03,924
- Puff the Magic Dragon.
- Dragon.

543
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,509
Dragon.

544
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:09,054
Which one of the Three Stooges
was Peter's favorite?

545
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,683
- Curly.
- Curly.

546
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:18,355
- He's everybody's favorite.
- Well, I like Shemp.

547
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,108
- Favorite ice cream?
- Baskin-Robbins.

548
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:24,194
- Favorite baseball team?
- Chicago.

549
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:25,863
Cubs or White Sox?

550
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,781
What the heck is going on?

551
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:30,576
Why are you asking her
all these questions?

552
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:33,662
Don't ask me. Ask her boyfriend.

553
00:39:35,457 --> 00:39:36,874
That isn't very funny, you know.

554
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:40,627
No, no. Not this boyfriend. Joe Fusco.

555
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:43,964
Joe Jr?

556
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:46,800
That's right.
Mr. Joe Fusco, Jr.

557
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:49,386
He said that you were intimate.

558
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:51,555
Yeah, well, he also said
he invented aluminum foil.

559
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:52,890
He's delusional.

560
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:54,725
He was very lucid when I talked to him.

561
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,810
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.

562
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:59,521
- Ma, are you okay?
- You see what you did?

563
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:00,731
What did I do?

564
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:05,152
You know, if she wanted to prove it,
she'd prove it.

565
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:20,834
Peter has one testicle.

566
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:25,881
- No way.
- Way.

567
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:27,424
About a month ago,

568
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:30,010
there was an accident,
and he was playing basketball,

569
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:34,139
and his friend had a pencil
in his back pocket.

570
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:40,854
Maybe...

571
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,273
No.

572
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:44,858
Oh, no.

573
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:47,986
- Well, somebody's gotta look.
- Don't look at me.

574
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:50,697
- No.
- Yeah, maybe...

575
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:54,701
- Listen, it's not my...
- Okay, I'm his mother.

576
00:40:56,329 --> 00:40:58,122
Oh, Ma.

577
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:17,057
Well, look at the bright side.

578
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:19,560
He's got more room in his Jockey shorts.

579
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:21,895
Ma.

580
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:34,533
- Who is it?
- What gives?

581
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:41,039
- You stood me up.
- For what?

582
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:43,083
- Our date.
- What date?

583
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,502
To the Ice Capades.
I had to eat your ticket.

584
00:41:45,587 --> 00:41:47,379
I never said
I would go on a date with you.

585
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:49,715
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

586
00:41:49,799 --> 00:41:51,008
- Did.
- Didn't.

587
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:54,386
- Who is it?
- Lucy, it's Saul.

588
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:57,139
- Oh, my God.
- What, are you two-timing Joe Jr?

589
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,015
I'm not two-timing.
I never one-timed.

590
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,251
- Hey, I'll fight the guy.
- Hey. Get in the closet.

591
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:05,272
- Not a word.
- Nice panties.

592
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:11,653
Hey.

593
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:15,115
I like boxer shorts, but I'll try these if...

594
00:42:15,742 --> 00:42:18,243
- Sorry.
- Have you got company?

595
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:20,954
No, TV. It's on next door.

596
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:25,959
Do you want some coffee
or tea, or something?

597
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:28,003
No, no. Not a thing.

598
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:30,464
Lucy, there's something you should know.

599
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:32,633
What?

600
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:35,719
Well, the night you visited Peter,
I was outside the door.

601
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:37,471
I know the truth.

602
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:44,528
Sorry. You know,
you don't have to worry,

603
00:42:44,612 --> 00:42:46,221
because I'm gonna tell them everything.

604
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,981
Don't tell them a thing.

605
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,527
You remember the day you said

606
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:54,292
you'd never do anything
to hurt the family?

607
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:55,739
- Yeah.
- Well, since they met you,

608
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,950
they figure they have Peter back.

609
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:01,703
Now, if you tell them the truth,
you'll take him away again.

610
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:06,750
They need you, Lucy.
Just like you need them.

611
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:11,296
Now, look, I know you're a good girl.

612
00:43:11,965 --> 00:43:13,924
And I know you'll do the right thing.

613
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:16,009
- I don't know.
- Yeah. Yes, you will.

614
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:23,183
By the way, how did you know about the...

615
00:43:23,268 --> 00:43:25,143
Peter, with the one...

616
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:29,648
You know something?
I don't wanna know.

617
00:43:32,694 --> 00:43:33,777
Bye.

618
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:38,282
Oh, my God.
What are you... What?

619
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,118
- What are you doing?
- I slipped.

620
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:44,997
- You're trying on my shoes?
- No.

621
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:46,456
When I fell, my foot went

622
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:48,221
right into the shoe.

623
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:51,044
- Who is it?
- It's me, Jack Callaghan.

624
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:53,714
Oh, my God, doesn't anybody
use a phone anymore?

625
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:56,550
- I do.
- I'm not talking about 900 numbers.

626
00:43:56,968 --> 00:43:58,093
Who told?

627
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:07,394
Hi. So, more questions?

628
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,771
No. I have an engagement present
for you.

629
00:44:11,441 --> 00:44:13,400
You really shouldn't have.

630
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:16,069
I didn't.
It's from my parents.

631
00:44:16,863 --> 00:44:19,031
It's furniture.
You want me to bring it up?

632
00:44:19,532 --> 00:44:21,533
Hey, was that Saul I saw leaving?

633
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:24,578
What's that?

634
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:26,204
Cat.

635
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:28,165
Big cat?

636
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:34,129
I think you should bring it to...
Bring it to Peter's apartment.

637
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:36,340
- You don't know what it is.
- Well, you know,

638
00:44:36,424 --> 00:44:38,925
anything would look nicer
in Peter's apartment.

639
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:41,011
You know what?
I'll come with you.

640
00:45:07,497 --> 00:45:09,831
You know what?
I think you parked too...

641
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:15,420
You know, I think you parked
too close to the other car.

642
00:45:15,505 --> 00:45:17,714
I had to. We gotta unload the furniture.

643
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:19,424
Ready for your surprise?

644
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:23,428
Ta-da!

645
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:27,724
That is great.
That is so great.

646
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:31,478
- You like that?
- Yeah.

647
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:34,481
Too bad. Ox bought you the love seat.

648
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:38,151
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be. I made this.

649
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:42,280
- This? No, you didn't.
- Shocking, isn't it?

650
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:45,534
- Can I sit in it?
- Rock out.

651
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,999
My God, this is perfect.

652
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:55,335
You should go into business
or something.

653
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:58,130
Well, that gets tricky.

654
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:02,050
Yeah, working with your
dad and everything, right?

655
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:04,594
The business used to be called
Callaghan and Sons,

656
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:08,515
and when Peter went off to law school,
it became Callaghan and Son.

657
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,985
If I were to leave, it'll just be Callaghan.

658
00:46:18,226 --> 00:46:20,193
Let's take a second here
and unlock the doors...

659
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:23,572
No, I got it, I got it. See?
Here we go.

660
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:29,244
This technique. It's always very...
A very modern technique.

661
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:32,289
Excuse me, sir.
What apartment?

662
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:33,457
57G.

663
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:38,378
Well, sir, I'm sorry, but guests
have to be announced, you know?

664
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:40,505
Well, I'm with her. I'm helping her.

665
00:46:42,592 --> 00:46:44,509
- So?
- You don't know her?

666
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,387
No.

667
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:51,766
But I'm new here.

668
00:46:51,893 --> 00:46:55,562
Well, she's Peter Callaghan's
fiancée in 57G.

669
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:57,814
Yeah.

670
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,486
They told me about her, sir.

671
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:04,821
She's scary.

672
00:47:04,906 --> 00:47:06,198
Tell me about it.

673
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:12,329
Be careful.

674
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:15,665
Maybe we should angle it a little bit.

675
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:18,543
I think it's wedged.

676
00:47:18,628 --> 00:47:21,796
Why don't you step back for a little bit?
I'm gonna try an old trick.

677
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,174
What's the trick?

678
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:25,425
Push it really hard.

679
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:28,386
Okay.

680
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:30,889
Okay, okay, push.

681
00:47:31,641 --> 00:47:32,641
I did.

682
00:47:35,645 --> 00:47:37,437
Do you want me to help you now?

683
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:40,148
- All right, a little help would be good.
- Okay.

684
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:45,654
Ready?
One, two, three.

685
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:57,874
I think the sofa should go right there.

686
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:07,717
Oh, no. No, no, no. Look at this.
Idiot has blocked me in.

687
00:48:07,969 --> 00:48:12,097
- But I told you not to park that close.
- Aargh.

688
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,724
Hey, check the meter, see what time.

689
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:18,520
It's 6:00. They can pretty much stay
here all night if they wanted to.

690
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,356
All night?

691
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:23,942
Good night.

692
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:25,902
You're just gonna leave me here
with the truck?

693
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,821
Basically, yeah.

694
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,990
Well, maybe I ought to walk you back.

695
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,533
Well, what for?

696
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:34,703
- For protection.
- No, I'm fine. I'm okay.

697
00:48:35,288 --> 00:48:39,082
For me. I don't wanna be here
by myself. This is Chicago.

698
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:50,010
You look cold.

699
00:48:50,303 --> 00:48:53,513
- You look cold.
- Probably because I am cold.

700
00:48:54,515 --> 00:48:55,557
How about you?

701
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:58,310
This jacket's reversible.
I'm wearing the warm side now.

702
00:48:58,394 --> 00:49:00,520
I see.

703
00:49:01,022 --> 00:49:02,355
You need a better coat.

704
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:07,152
- This is my dad's.
- Then he's probably freezing.

705
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,903
He passed away.

706
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:11,990
- Sorry.
- It's not your fault.

707
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:17,037
He passed away last year.
I don't even remember my mom, so...

708
00:49:17,747 --> 00:49:19,456
Well, what was he like?

709
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:22,876
He was a lot like me.
Dark hair, flat chest.

710
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:26,087
What do you remember most about him?

711
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:30,008
That. Okay.
Well...

712
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:33,136
He liked maps.

713
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:36,181
Yeah, I live by maps.
My truck's filled with them.

714
00:49:37,183 --> 00:49:40,143
He used to hear of a place on the TV,
we would pull out the atlas,

715
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:44,256
we'd find where it was and we'd route
out this, like, little way to get there.

716
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,733
If there was one place
in the world where you'd go...

717
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,234
Florence.

718
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:51,571
Italy? I haven't delivered
any furniture to Florence yet,

719
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:53,698
- but I'm told it's nice.
- Yeah.

720
00:49:53,783 --> 00:49:55,533
I take it you've never been there.

721
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:59,537
Well, you know, the L doesn't exactly
make it all the way to Florence, so...

722
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:02,916
But I do have...

723
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:06,836
My passport.

724
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:09,714
- You have your passport? With you?
- Yes, I do.

725
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:12,159
Yes, well, just in case I need to
quickly leave the country.

726
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:14,511
- You need to...
- Yeah, it's perfect. It's great.

727
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:18,973
You're right.
You're not very photogenic at all.

728
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:21,935
Just joking.

729
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:23,770
There aren't any stamps in that.

730
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:26,198
Yeah, well, I haven't gone anywhere yet.

731
00:50:26,282 --> 00:50:28,775
But, you know, I'm planning
the trip to Florence really soon,

732
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,735
so, you know, I'll go.

733
00:50:32,822 --> 00:50:34,989
That'll make your dad very proud.

734
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:36,366
Yeah.

735
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:43,039
You know, in a very small way,
you kind of remind me of him a little bit.

736
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:45,709
I see.

737
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:48,920
So he was a classy guy,
always a gentleman.

738
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:50,004
A working man, who...

739
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:52,006
Who just stepped in doggy poopy.

740
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:57,721
Now, that's classy.
That's classy.

741
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:02,350
All right, tell me more.
Where did you grow up?

742
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:05,055
God, you've just become
Mr. Chatty this evening.

743
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:07,313
The fact is,
I'm about to start shivering,

744
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:09,983
and making conversation
keeps my face from freezing.

745
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:16,156
Thank you. I had a good time.

746
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:21,144
- It's slippery here. Come on.
- I'm fine.

747
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:23,179
We got this far,
I'll take you the rest of the way.

748
00:51:23,264 --> 00:51:25,457
You gotta watch out. A little icy.

749
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:28,293
So you gonna go see Peter tomorrow?

750
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,717
- All right.
- Do not take me with you.

751
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:38,428
- No, it's all right. Not too bad.
- You got it? Good? Okay.

752
00:51:44,894 --> 00:51:47,604
This is big.

753
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:50,064
- There we go. All right.
- Okay.

754
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:07,791
- All right?
- Yeah.

755
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:12,086
I think we're all right now.
Yeah. Let's just move this way.

756
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:13,421
This way.

757
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:15,215
- Whoa. Ow.
- Ow.

758
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:16,925
What was that?

759
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:19,135
Was that my pants or my muscles?

760
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:21,805
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

761
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:23,556
- Whoa.
- Okay.

762
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,688
Oh, man.

763
00:52:32,233 --> 00:52:34,408
Do you have an extra pair of pants
in your apartment?

764
00:52:34,493 --> 00:52:36,394
If you fit into my pants, I will kill myself.

765
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:40,178
- You don't have to follow me.
- No, you're blocking the wind.

766
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:51,125
I'll wait till you get inside.

767
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:52,836
Well, good night.

768
00:52:54,755 --> 00:52:56,089
Night.

769
00:52:58,551 --> 00:53:01,177
- I'll see you when I see you?
- Yeah.

770
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:22,991
All right, Lucy, it's either me or him.

771
00:53:23,075 --> 00:53:24,200
Him.

772
00:53:27,872 --> 00:53:30,456
You don't have to answer right away.

773
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:56,941
I'm having an affair.
I like Jack.

774
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:58,359
Who's Jack?

775
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:00,236
- Peter's brother.
- So?

776
00:54:00,321 --> 00:54:02,572
- So he thinks I'm engaged.
- To who?

777
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:03,990
To Peter.

778
00:54:05,451 --> 00:54:08,036
Lucy, I really don't have time for this.

779
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:11,164
Oh, no, no, no.
You have to tell me what to do.

780
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:12,749
Tell the truth.

781
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,336
If I tell Jack that I lied to his family,
he will never speak to me again.

782
00:54:16,629 --> 00:54:20,882
And Ox and Midge and Mary and Saul.

783
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:23,343
Saul?
Who's Saul?

784
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:27,680
He's the next-door neighbor.
But you know what? Actually, he knows.

785
00:54:28,057 --> 00:54:30,308
Lucy, you're born into a family.

786
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:32,852
You do not join them
like you do the Marines.

787
00:54:34,647 --> 00:54:36,356
You have to tell me what to do.

788
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:38,775
Pull the plug.

789
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,361
- You are sick.
- I'm sick?

790
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:43,988
You're cheating on a vegetable.

791
00:54:46,075 --> 00:54:47,951
Down and dirty.

792
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:52,330
Are you gonna fold?

793
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:54,958
You're not gonna fold?

794
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,544
He is staying in with a pair.

795
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:01,839
Very impressive. Very bold, confident.

796
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:04,467
Full house.

797
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:07,845
You are unlucky at cards.

798
00:55:09,765 --> 00:55:11,599
But lucky in love.

799
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:19,148
Remember in, like, fifth or sixth grade,

800
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:21,943
I was starting to get
really good at poker,

801
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:24,779
and going home with lots of lunch money?

802
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:28,491
I got to know the principal's
office really well.

803
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:31,411
He always used to say to me,

804
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:35,039
"How come you can't be more
like your brother Peter?"

805
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:40,753
Well, you know what?
I was all right with that.

806
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:44,048
I had no problems with that,
because I was proud of you.

807
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:48,094
And I was never envious
of anything that you had.

808
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:55,101
Until now.

809
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:02,358
I'll cut the deck.

810
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:05,528
High card gets Lucy.

811
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:16,039
All right, we'll go best out of three.

812
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:19,250
So, Lucy, have you and Peter decided

813
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:21,294
where you're gonna go on your honeymoon?

814
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:22,920
I went to Cuba.

815
00:56:23,297 --> 00:56:25,465
Ricky Ricardo was Cuban.

816
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:27,717
Didn't Peter look great today?

817
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:28,810
That kid.

818
00:56:28,819 --> 00:56:30,386
You know, he should've been an actor.

819
00:56:30,471 --> 00:56:31,471
He's tall.

820
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,306
All the great ones were tall.

821
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:36,809
Lucy, you think you can find me
a nice girl for Jack?

822
00:56:37,144 --> 00:56:38,269
Mom, come on.

823
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:41,981
Well, I really don't know Jack's type,
so I'm not one to...

824
00:56:42,316 --> 00:56:44,567
I like blonds. Chubby ones.

825
00:56:47,863 --> 00:56:49,280
Alan Ladd wasn't tall.

826
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:51,574
Marshal Dillon was 6'5".

827
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:54,827
Well, we all know
who Lucy's type is.

828
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:57,997
These mashed potatoes are so creamy.

829
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:00,500
You like brunettes.

830
00:57:01,877 --> 00:57:03,878
I could never make a good pot roast.

831
00:57:04,004 --> 00:57:05,171
You need good beef.

832
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:09,425
Argentina has great beef.
Beef and Nazis.

833
00:57:09,885 --> 00:57:11,677
John Wayne was tall.

834
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,805
Dustin Hoffman was 5'6".

835
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:16,849
Would you wanna see Dustin
Hoffman save the Alamo?

836
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:18,655
These mashed potatoes
are so creamy.

837
00:57:18,727 --> 00:57:20,895
- Spain has good beef.
- Mary mashed them.

838
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:24,190
- Cesar Romero was tall.
- Cesar Romero was not Spanish.

839
00:57:24,525 --> 00:57:26,400
I didn't say Cesar Romero was Spanish.

840
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,819
Well, what did you say?

841
00:57:28,028 --> 00:57:29,570
I said Cesar Romero was tall.

842
00:57:29,655 --> 00:57:32,056
- We all know he's tall.
- Well, that's what I said.

843
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:34,375
Cesar Romero was tall. That's all I said.

844
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:37,537
So if you need any help
with history, don't call me.

845
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:41,457
Now, remember, honey, if you're free
for New Year's, we wanna see you.

846
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:42,834
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah.

847
00:57:42,918 --> 00:57:44,627
- I had a great time. Thank you.
- Us, too.

848
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:46,671
- Bye.
- Bye-bye, Lucy.

849
00:57:46,755 --> 00:57:49,132
Hey, look, you guys.
You're under the mistletoe.

850
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,636
- Kiss her then. It's mistletoe.
- Yeah.

851
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,321
- It's tradition.
- It's Christmas.

852
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:57,557
Come on, idiot, kiss her.

853
00:58:00,561 --> 00:58:02,812
- There you go.
- Yeah.

854
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:04,772
- Good night.
- Bye.

855
00:58:04,857 --> 00:58:05,982
Good night.

856
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:07,733
Mary,
we're on dish detail tonight.

857
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:08,901
- Let's go.
- Ma.

858
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:12,113
I don't wanna hear
any excuses.

859
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:14,574
Since the first year, I remember.

860
00:58:22,291 --> 00:58:23,749
Regular fare.

861
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:28,713
One token, please.

862
00:58:29,423 --> 00:58:31,924
My God, Mary, what are you doing here?

863
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:34,552
Hi. You wanna come through?

864
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:36,470
- We can?
- Yeah, absolutely.

865
00:58:37,556 --> 00:58:38,639
Come on in.

866
00:58:38,724 --> 00:58:40,349
Transfer, please.

867
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:41,726
- Hi.
- Hi.

868
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:43,019
Hey, who's this?

869
00:58:43,103 --> 00:58:44,937
- I'm Mary. This is Beth.
- Hi.

870
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:46,522
Mary's my...

871
00:58:46,607 --> 00:58:48,941
Lucy's going to marry my brother Peter.

872
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:51,527
What?
Lucy, you're getting married?

873
00:58:52,112 --> 00:58:53,863
Well, it hasn't
really been announced.

874
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:58,451
So it's a little awkward for
me to say anything, and...

875
00:58:58,994 --> 00:59:01,662
- The train is here.
- Train. Okay, I'll see you later.

876
00:59:01,747 --> 00:59:04,457
Thank you for coming.
It's nice to meet you, Beth.

877
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,375
Girl, are you pregnant?

878
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,127
Yes, I'm pregnant, Celeste.

879
00:59:08,212 --> 00:59:09,932
Lucy, you're not telling me
what's going on.

880
00:59:10,005 --> 00:59:12,131
You're not giving me details.
What's going on?

881
00:59:12,216 --> 00:59:14,634
Celeste, you have to have sex
in order to be pregnant.

882
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:16,260
But I thought you were engaged.

883
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:19,972
Well, we're waiting.

884
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:23,100
Waiting?

885
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:26,687
Peter?
Hi, it's Ashley.

886
00:59:26,772 --> 00:59:28,189
Is this machine working?

887
00:59:28,482 --> 00:59:29,857
Look, I'm back in Chicago

888
00:59:29,942 --> 00:59:32,735
and I'm kind of shocked
that you haven't called me back.

889
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:34,654
Look, I really would like to
hear from you,

890
00:59:34,738 --> 00:59:38,324
and I'd like to see my cat. Call me.

891
00:59:39,076 --> 00:59:43,079
New Year's Eve hasn't been the same
since Guy Lombardo died.

892
00:59:43,163 --> 00:59:44,956
I love a clarinet.

893
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,083
You know, nobody plays the clarinet
anymore.

894
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:50,044
Guy Lombardo didn't play the clarinet.

895
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:52,505
I didn't say Guy Lombardo
played the clarinet.

896
00:59:52,806 --> 00:59:54,340
- Hey, Pop.
- Your Benny Goodman,

897
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:55,967
he could play the licorice stick.

898
00:59:56,051 --> 00:59:58,177
- We got the Van Allan estate.
- Hey, way to go.

899
00:59:58,262 --> 00:59:59,502
- Attaboy.
- That's great.

900
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:01,430
- That's great. Attaboy.
- Way to go.

901
01:00:01,515 --> 01:00:03,057
Hey, everybody.

902
01:00:03,684 --> 01:00:04,934
Lucy's pregnant.

903
01:00:06,103 --> 01:00:08,223
How did you find out?
What do you mean she's pregnant?

904
01:00:08,272 --> 01:00:10,273
- How do you know?
- That's what Beth said.

905
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:12,441
Jack, do you know anything about this?

906
01:00:12,526 --> 01:00:13,526
Go up to your room.

907
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:19,699
- Who is it?
- Joe Jr.

908
01:00:20,909 --> 01:00:22,368
I'm not here.

909
01:00:22,995 --> 01:00:24,328
I know that trick.

910
01:00:25,414 --> 01:00:27,081
Hey, my old man's got a set of keys.

911
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:29,792
That is illegal and you know it, Joey.

912
01:00:30,085 --> 01:00:31,294
Ta-da!

913
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:32,985
I told them to give me the same ones

914
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:35,548
they use in the winner's circle
at Arlington.

915
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:37,550
They're beautiful.

916
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:39,927
I can't accept them.

917
01:00:42,097 --> 01:00:43,723
I could move in here.

918
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:46,267
I bet you Pop would knock
50 bucks off the rent.

919
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:48,561
I have six months left to live.

920
01:00:49,563 --> 01:00:51,314
You're just trying
to make me feel better.

921
01:00:52,232 --> 01:00:54,275
It's that other guy, isn't it?

922
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:55,651
What do you mean?

923
01:00:55,736 --> 01:00:57,862
I've seen the way you look at him.

924
01:00:57,946 --> 01:01:00,573
What?
How do I look at him?

925
01:01:00,741 --> 01:01:02,742
Like you just seen your first Trans Am.

926
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:07,413
Here, take them.

927
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:09,749
You can lay them on my coffin.

928
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:14,086
Thank you.

929
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:24,221
Are you wearing the black bra?

930
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,558
I love black underwears.

931
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:36,275
Jack.

932
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:38,069
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

933
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:43,240
You're going to a party.

934
01:01:43,325 --> 01:01:45,317
Yeah, my friend Celeste
is having a party tonight.

935
01:01:45,402 --> 01:01:47,486
Great. Hey, I'll drive you.

936
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:50,115
You know what?
It's really not that far. It's fine.

937
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:51,916
No, come on, come on.

938
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:55,002
Okay, but it's really not that far.

939
01:01:55,379 --> 01:01:57,463
I move a lot of things with this truck.

940
01:01:58,382 --> 01:02:00,049
So is everything okay?

941
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:01,842
Why?
Why wouldn't it be okay?

942
01:02:01,927 --> 01:02:03,594
You're just acting really weird.

943
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:05,712
- No, I'm not being weird.
- Yes, you are.

944
01:02:05,797 --> 01:02:07,698
No, I'm not being weird.

945
01:02:08,016 --> 01:02:11,310
- So, what about Peter?
- What about Peter?

946
01:02:11,645 --> 01:02:14,397
Peter is going to have a lot
to deal with when he wakes up.

947
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:17,024
- Lucy, hi. How are you?
- Hi.

948
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:20,152
Come in, come in. Hey, everybody.

949
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:22,655
Lucy and her fiancé are here.

950
01:02:23,532 --> 01:02:26,175
- Lucy. How's it going?
- Jerry, you know Peter, right?

951
01:02:26,259 --> 01:02:28,586
Thank you. Hi. Take his coat, Cindy.

952
01:02:28,670 --> 01:02:30,538
- Is this Peter?
- I gotta talk to you.

953
01:02:30,622 --> 01:02:31,914
Well, jeez, he looks good.

954
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:34,375
That's not Peter, that's Jack.

955
01:02:34,501 --> 01:02:36,961
- Who's Jack again?
- Peter's brother.

956
01:02:37,045 --> 01:02:39,088
- Peter's the guy who's in the coma?
- Yeah.

957
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:40,548
So then why did you bring Jack?

958
01:02:40,632 --> 01:02:42,591
I didn't bring Jack. He followed me here.

959
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:45,511
- So Jack's the fiancé?
- No, Peter.

960
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:47,096
Peter doesn't even know you exist.

961
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:49,598
- I know.
- So Jack is Peter?

962
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:50,641
Yeah.

963
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:52,101
- Lucy.
- Yeah?

964
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:54,895
They have doctors for this kind of thing.

965
01:02:57,065 --> 01:02:58,357
Hey.

966
01:02:59,067 --> 01:03:00,818
- That's spiked.
- Thank God.

967
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:03,446
- You shouldn't have any.
- Why not?

968
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:06,031
Because it's not good for the baby.

969
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:09,869
Wait a minute, will you?

970
01:03:09,953 --> 01:03:11,987
- It's freezing.
- Watch out, watch out.

971
01:03:12,072 --> 01:03:15,099
This whole evening did not work out
well at all, and...

972
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:18,169
And I'm supposed to share
some responsibility in that?

973
01:03:18,253 --> 01:03:21,589
No. Would you slow down a little bit?

974
01:03:21,965 --> 01:03:25,926
Look, it was just a misunderstanding,

975
01:03:26,011 --> 01:03:27,720
and on top of the Joe Jr. Thing...

976
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:28,846
Excuse me?

977
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:31,182
It's nothing.

978
01:03:31,266 --> 01:03:34,226
No, no, no, there's no nothing now.
What Joe Jr. Thing?

979
01:03:35,604 --> 01:03:37,146
The leaning thing.

980
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:38,522
The leaning thing?

981
01:03:38,607 --> 01:03:39,899
- Yeah.
- Okay.

982
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:45,571
What do you mean by the leaning...
Because he gave me flowers?

983
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:47,781
And then you leaned.

984
01:03:47,866 --> 01:03:50,075
- And then I leaned.
- Yeah.

985
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,361
Okay. How did I lean when I leaned?

986
01:03:52,446 --> 01:03:53,704
- How were you leaning?
- Yeah.

987
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:56,332
It was a lot different than hugging.
Hugging's very different.

988
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:59,084
Hugging, that involves arms and hands,

989
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:03,839
and leaning is whole bodies
moving in like this.

990
01:04:04,299 --> 01:04:07,468
Leaning involves wanting

991
01:04:08,595 --> 01:04:12,556
and accepting, leaning.

992
01:04:15,435 --> 01:04:16,977
Hey, Luce.

993
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,688
Is this guy bothering you?

994
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:24,026
No, no.

995
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:28,572
Are you sure?
Because it looks like he's leaning.

996
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:31,951
Thank you. See?

997
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:35,996
I'll be right over here
if you need me.

998
01:04:36,164 --> 01:04:38,123
Okay, thank you very much.

999
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:39,833
I know karate.

1000
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:47,383
Okay, is...

1001
01:04:48,468 --> 01:04:50,344
Now, all right,
what about the other thing?

1002
01:04:50,428 --> 01:04:52,471
The other thing?
The other misunderstanding?

1003
01:04:53,682 --> 01:04:55,432
Why did you think I was pregnant?

1004
01:04:56,351 --> 01:04:59,061
Well, Mary said that she had heard
something like that.

1005
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:01,855
And you believed her?

1006
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:04,108
I didn't have any reason
not to believe her.

1007
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:07,695
So the only reason your brother
would wanna marry someone like me

1008
01:05:07,779 --> 01:05:09,071
is if I was pregnant, right?

1009
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:10,698
No, no.

1010
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:15,869
Good night.

1011
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:20,165
The fact is,
you're not really Peter's type.

1012
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,668
Yeah, Jack? All right.
Whose type am I?

1013
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:28,858
- Thank you.
- Look, it's a great idea, you and Peter.

1014
01:05:28,942 --> 01:05:31,051
It's just not obvious
to the whole world, that's all.

1015
01:05:31,136 --> 01:05:33,896
You know what, Jack?
I've had a really lousy Christmas.

1016
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:35,639
You've just managed
to kill my New Year's.

1017
01:05:35,724 --> 01:05:38,475
If you come back on Easter,
you can burn down my apartment.

1018
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:41,854
- Hey, come on, Lucy.
- What do you want from me, Jack?

1019
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:44,273
I want you not to be unhappy.

1020
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:46,442
And what are you,
the happiness guru, Jack?

1021
01:05:46,526 --> 01:05:47,526
Are you happy?

1022
01:05:47,611 --> 01:05:50,446
I don't remember you having
had a conversation with your father.

1023
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:52,189
You wanna leave the business, don't you?

1024
01:05:52,273 --> 01:05:55,284
Is this just another miscommunication
that we are having here?

1025
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:57,119
What do you know about my family?

1026
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:59,413
Spending a week with them
does not make you an expert.

1027
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:02,207
Spending a lifetime with them
hasn't made you one either.

1028
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:08,797
Yeah, well, I know that keeping
your family happy gets complicated.

1029
01:06:08,882 --> 01:06:11,925
Would your father be happy knowing
you're sitting in a token booth

1030
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:14,136
planning vacations
that you aren't taking?

1031
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:20,225
No, he wouldn't. You're right.

1032
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:24,730
But you have no idea
what it's like to be alone.

1033
01:06:25,065 --> 01:06:27,232
Hey, you have Peter.

1034
01:06:27,901 --> 01:06:29,568
I don't have anybody.

1035
01:06:29,694 --> 01:06:32,071
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

1036
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:35,783
Good night.

1037
01:06:41,122 --> 01:06:42,998
Happy New Year!

1038
01:06:45,794 --> 01:06:47,169
Happy New Year!

1039
01:07:12,112 --> 01:07:14,029
Ox, they called me
and told me to get down here.

1040
01:07:14,114 --> 01:07:16,073
- What happened?
- He's awake.

1041
01:07:17,617 --> 01:07:20,452
Will the Meyers family
please meet in the solarium?

1042
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:23,706
- Boy, will he be glad to see you.
- Yeah.

1043
01:07:26,334 --> 01:07:27,501
Peter.

1044
01:07:28,503 --> 01:07:29,878
Peter.

1045
01:07:30,547 --> 01:07:32,423
Your family's here, Peter.

1046
01:08:10,587 --> 01:08:11,837
Who are you?

1047
01:08:18,178 --> 01:08:20,137
My God.

1048
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:23,348
He's got amnesia.

1049
01:08:27,812 --> 01:08:30,189
Lacunar amnesia is a condition

1050
01:08:30,273 --> 01:08:33,901
in which memory loss
is localized and patchy.

1051
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:36,195
Limited to isolated events.

1052
01:08:37,197 --> 01:08:39,865
- Selective amnesia?
- Okay, exactly.

1053
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:45,287
I'm sorry. I need to tell you
something that is really important.

1054
01:08:46,831 --> 01:08:48,707
- I was never...
- Pregnant?

1055
01:08:50,043 --> 01:08:52,169
We know. Jack called us.

1056
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:55,589
- Jack.
- Hey, so he's come out of it?

1057
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:57,633
I'm so glad you're here, honey.

1058
01:08:57,717 --> 01:08:59,718
Excuse me, Doctor?
He's up again.

1059
01:08:59,928 --> 01:09:01,553
All right, let's go.

1060
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:04,056
Jack.
I'm so glad you're here.

1061
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:07,017
- Saul.
- Now, now, listen. Let me handle it.

1062
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:09,978
I'm too old a friend and too old a person
for them to kill.

1063
01:09:10,063 --> 01:09:11,730
- I'll take care of it.
- Okay.

1064
01:09:11,815 --> 01:09:13,557
- And I'll do it right now. Come on.
- Okay.

1065
01:09:13,641 --> 01:09:15,167
I'm right behind you.

1066
01:09:16,736 --> 01:09:19,029
- How you feeling, champ?
- I don't know.

1067
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:21,198
Hi.

1068
01:09:22,075 --> 01:09:23,826
Hey, remember her?

1069
01:09:27,664 --> 01:09:29,540
- Should I?
- Look closely.

1070
01:09:33,253 --> 01:09:34,920
She looks a little familiar.

1071
01:09:35,755 --> 01:09:37,923
- Why?
- I think it's coming back.

1072
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:41,093
- I think so.
- What's coming back? Tell me.

1073
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:43,512
- Tell me. What?
- Peter, you have amnesia.

1074
01:09:44,097 --> 01:09:45,138
I do?

1075
01:09:45,223 --> 01:09:47,599
Peter, you're engaged.

1076
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:50,018
- To who?
- To Lucy.

1077
01:09:50,103 --> 01:09:52,396
Lucy. Who's Lucy?

1078
01:09:52,814 --> 01:09:54,147
You don't remember, do you?

1079
01:09:54,232 --> 01:09:56,775
Excuse me.
Got some Jell-O for you today.

1080
01:09:57,443 --> 01:09:59,611
Do I like Jell-O?

1081
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:02,447
I think he's had enough excitement
for one evening.

1082
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:04,658
- Let's all go home.
- Hang in there, champ.

1083
01:10:04,742 --> 01:10:07,369
- Good night, honey.
- Good night, Mom.

1084
01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:10,330
- It's so good to see you.
- Mom.

1085
01:10:10,415 --> 01:10:12,958
- He looks so good, you know?
- He's going to be fine.

1086
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:15,711
- I think he looked wonderful.
- All right, we'll be back.

1087
01:10:15,795 --> 01:10:17,754
Jack, you, too. Come on.
Let's go home.

1088
01:10:20,133 --> 01:10:21,925
Saul, where have you been?

1089
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:23,886
What?
I'm not allowed to go to the bathroom?

1090
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:25,929
- Saul.
- I'm handling it.

1091
01:10:26,014 --> 01:10:27,806
- I will tell them.
- When? When?

1092
01:10:27,891 --> 01:10:28,891
On my golden anniversary?

1093
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:31,084
- Lucy, I'll tell them.
- You better tell them.

1094
01:10:31,168 --> 01:10:32,861
I said I'd tell them.

1095
01:10:33,313 --> 01:10:36,106
A, B, C, D, E, F, G

1096
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:13,018
Jack, you've been really great
this week.

1097
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:19,191
Yeah, like when I accused
you of lying to everybody.

1098
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:23,695
Or when I accused you
of having a relationship with Joe Jr.

1099
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:28,575
Or when I thought you were pregnant,
and I announced it to all your friends.

1100
01:11:29,035 --> 01:11:32,037
You've had a really busy week
this week, haven't you?

1101
01:11:34,082 --> 01:11:35,749
Look, Jack, I...

1102
01:11:38,336 --> 01:11:43,340
Starting tomorrow, things are
probably gonna be kind of different.

1103
01:11:44,926 --> 01:11:46,218
Yeah.

1104
01:11:48,763 --> 01:11:51,056
I just wanted you to know
that you've become

1105
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:57,020
a really good friend.

1106
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:03,235
Okay.

1107
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:07,072
Good friend.

1108
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:09,074
- Lucy.
- Yeah?

1109
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:15,330
I didn't mean what I said
about you and Peter.

1110
01:12:15,415 --> 01:12:19,334
I think you two are gonna
make a really terrific couple.

1111
01:12:20,086 --> 01:12:23,213
And I'm really glad
that you won't be alone anymore.

1112
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:30,178
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

1113
01:13:20,188 --> 01:13:22,022
Jack?
Is that you?

1114
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:24,649
Hey, Pop.

1115
01:13:25,985 --> 01:13:28,653
- Brought you some donuts.
- You're a savior.

1116
01:13:30,364 --> 01:13:32,949
Your mother's got me eating
these fat-free bran muffins.

1117
01:13:33,326 --> 01:13:34,951
They taste like plywood.

1118
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:37,037
Catching up?

1119
01:13:37,205 --> 01:13:39,998
It's been almost a week
since I read the obituaries.

1120
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:43,960
You know, we missed a lot of good
stuff the day after Christmas.

1121
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:47,380
Been a hell of a week, hasn't it?

1122
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:51,635
Life is a pain in the ass. I'll tell you.

1123
01:13:52,011 --> 01:13:55,847
You know, you work hard,
try to provide for the family,

1124
01:13:56,808 --> 01:14:00,268
and then for one minute,
everything's good.

1125
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:04,856
Everyone's well, everyone's happy.

1126
01:14:05,316 --> 01:14:08,068
In that one minute, you have peace.

1127
01:14:10,363 --> 01:14:11,863
Pop.

1128
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:14,574
This isn't that minute.

1129
01:14:16,494 --> 01:14:17,619
What do you mean?

1130
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:25,085
You remember that rocking chair
I made for Grandma?

1131
01:14:25,211 --> 01:14:26,795
Are you kidding me?

1132
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:28,880
It's so fancy, she won't even sit in it.

1133
01:14:29,132 --> 01:14:32,425
This fancy chair, two months ago,
I sold three just like it.

1134
01:14:32,593 --> 01:14:35,595
I've sold two dining tables.
I got orders for six more.

1135
01:14:36,139 --> 01:14:37,806
Well, that's a good side business.

1136
01:14:38,224 --> 01:14:41,726
It's not a side business.
This is good business.

1137
01:14:45,273 --> 01:14:46,773
Wait a second.

1138
01:14:47,859 --> 01:14:49,401
You don't want my business?

1139
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:55,157
No, I don't.

1140
01:15:01,956 --> 01:15:05,083
- How long have you felt this way?
- A long time.

1141
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:08,628
Well, why didn't you say
something sooner?

1142
01:15:10,256 --> 01:15:13,842
I could have sold the whole damn thing
to Uncle Eddy for twice its value.

1143
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:17,387
I could have taken your mother on
the cruise with Kathie Lee Gifford.

1144
01:15:18,890 --> 01:15:20,765
You're not mad at me?

1145
01:15:20,975 --> 01:15:22,767
Are you nuts?

1146
01:15:23,102 --> 01:15:26,104
You are nuts.
You wanna make rocking chairs.

1147
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:31,401
Hey, Mrs. Fletcher finally went?

1148
01:15:31,819 --> 01:15:34,362
Her dining room alone
has got to be worth 40 grand.

1149
01:15:34,447 --> 01:15:36,615
Yeah.
Those McMurphy boys,

1150
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:38,950
they were moving in
before the deed was done.

1151
01:15:39,043 --> 01:15:40,702
That's their problem. They're too pushy.

1152
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:43,079
- They're pushy, aren't they?
- We'll call them next week.

1153
01:15:43,331 --> 01:15:44,831
You call them next week.

1154
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:48,168
That's right, I'll call them next week.

1155
01:15:48,294 --> 01:15:49,336
Yeah.

1156
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:51,630
- Do I get a donut?
- I'm sorry.

1157
01:15:52,089 --> 01:15:56,301
22, 10, 40.
Eighth-grade locker combination.

1158
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:58,053
Birth date, 3-11-59.

1159
01:15:58,137 --> 01:15:59,721
You have to remember Lucy.

1160
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:02,974
Social security number, 144-60-6894.

1161
01:16:03,059 --> 01:16:06,394
You love her. You just don't remember.

1162
01:16:06,604 --> 01:16:09,439
Three-point-seven-three grade point
average, Northwestern University.

1163
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:11,024
Can I talk to Peter alone?

1164
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:14,569
- Everything okay, Saul?
- Senior class president, 1981.

1165
01:16:14,695 --> 01:16:16,079
I just wanna talk to my godson.

1166
01:16:16,164 --> 01:16:17,948
- Let me take that for you.
- Thanks.

1167
01:16:18,032 --> 01:16:19,833
- We'll be back.
- We'll see you later.

1168
01:16:20,076 --> 01:16:22,285
- You sure, Saul?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

1169
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:23,828
- See you, son.
- See you, Dad.

1170
01:16:26,332 --> 01:16:28,750
Peter, I've known you
since you were born.

1171
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:32,837
I've been to every major event
in your life from Cub Scouts to...

1172
01:16:33,339 --> 01:16:36,174
Well, to the day you discovered
hair on your schmeckel.

1173
01:16:37,551 --> 01:16:39,219
You've got a good education.

1174
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:42,055
You're very popular
with all those friends of yours.

1175
01:16:42,223 --> 01:16:44,140
You make a nice living.

1176
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:47,060
And everybody knows
you're a good-looking kid.

1177
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:51,564
But, Peter, you're a putz.

1178
01:16:52,692 --> 01:16:53,692
Excuse me?

1179
01:16:54,193 --> 01:16:56,611
Now, look, I'm your godfather.
I mean, I love you.

1180
01:16:56,696 --> 01:16:59,322
I couldn't love you any more
if you were my own son.

1181
01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:03,159
But the fact of the matter is you're...

1182
01:17:03,369 --> 01:17:04,828
Well, you're a putz.

1183
01:17:06,706 --> 01:17:08,164
Is there a point to this?

1184
01:17:09,041 --> 01:17:10,458
Lucy.

1185
01:17:12,753 --> 01:17:16,006
Peter, there's something
you have to know about her.

1186
01:17:17,258 --> 01:17:18,800
You see, she...

1187
01:17:20,428 --> 01:17:21,720
Well...

1188
01:17:24,849 --> 01:17:26,057
She's...

1189
01:17:28,394 --> 01:17:29,728
You know...

1190
01:17:31,814 --> 01:17:35,358
She's not only your fiancée,
she's your guardian angel.

1191
01:17:35,526 --> 01:17:38,737
Yeah.
Peter, she saved your life.

1192
01:17:40,031 --> 01:17:41,865
Now, she's coming to see you today,

1193
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:43,992
and I want you to do yourself a favor.

1194
01:17:44,952 --> 01:17:47,872
I want you to look deeply into her eyes
and listen with the heart of a man

1195
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:50,248
who has just been given
a second chance at life.

1196
01:17:51,459 --> 01:17:54,961
And after two minutes,
if you're not madly in love with her,

1197
01:17:55,421 --> 01:17:57,839
why, tell her you wanna break up.

1198
01:17:58,591 --> 01:18:00,258
And you can go back to being a putz.

1199
01:18:01,093 --> 01:18:02,133
But if in the two minutes,

1200
01:18:02,136 --> 01:18:04,888
you see what the rest of us
only took seconds to see,

1201
01:18:05,598 --> 01:18:08,308
you will propose to her
for the second time,

1202
01:18:08,392 --> 01:18:11,102
and marry her
before she has a chance to escape.

1203
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:18,651
Before she comes, take a little time

1204
01:18:18,736 --> 01:18:22,280
and think about
what an old putz just told you.

1205
01:18:22,448 --> 01:18:23,782
All right?

1206
01:18:27,161 --> 01:18:30,997
You know, if I was 40 years younger,
I'd marry her myself.

1207
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:33,541
That is, if she'd convert.

1208
01:18:34,126 --> 01:18:36,795
- Hey, that's a joke.
- I know.

1209
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:00,527
Lucy.

1210
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:02,904
- Hi.
- Hi.

1211
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:08,785
I came to bring you back your things.

1212
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:10,829
Would you like a sandwich?

1213
01:19:13,791 --> 01:19:16,126
No, no. I'm okay, thanks.

1214
01:19:16,919 --> 01:19:18,503
Can I get you anything?

1215
01:19:18,879 --> 01:19:20,255
I wish I had my own clothes.

1216
01:19:20,548 --> 01:19:22,549
Well, I like your blue pinstripe.

1217
01:19:22,675 --> 01:19:23,967
- Double-breasted?
- Yeah.

1218
01:19:24,176 --> 01:19:25,635
- That's my favorite.
- Really?

1219
01:19:25,719 --> 01:19:26,845
Yeah.

1220
01:19:29,265 --> 01:19:30,348
Please sit down.

1221
01:19:41,152 --> 01:19:45,822
I saw a picture of you
when you saved the three squirrels.

1222
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:48,867
They never call, they never write.

1223
01:19:49,201 --> 01:19:50,785
That was a long time ago.

1224
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:54,456
Yeah, I guess we don't get to do
many heroic things as an adult.

1225
01:19:54,832 --> 01:19:56,583
That's for sure.

1226
01:19:57,251 --> 01:19:58,501
You do, though.

1227
01:19:58,711 --> 01:20:02,213
No. Jumping in front of
that train was unusual.

1228
01:20:03,007 --> 01:20:06,384
I don't think I've done anything
truly heroic my whole life.

1229
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:09,304
I chased a purse snatcher once.

1230
01:20:09,597 --> 01:20:11,306
Well, that's something.

1231
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:13,141
I pretended to pull a hamstring.

1232
01:20:14,768 --> 01:20:17,728
Well, most guys probably wouldn't have
chased after him in the first place.

1233
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:19,898
I mean, I work at the L.
Believe me, I know.

1234
01:20:21,901 --> 01:20:24,194
You give up your seat
every day in the train.

1235
01:20:24,612 --> 01:20:25,820
Well...

1236
01:20:26,947 --> 01:20:28,198
That's not heroic.

1237
01:20:28,407 --> 01:20:30,742
It is to the person who sits in it.

1238
01:20:32,119 --> 01:20:36,039
And you always gave me something
to look forward to every day, so...

1239
01:20:37,917 --> 01:20:39,959
You know, you do remind me of someone.

1240
01:20:42,213 --> 01:20:43,755
It's probably you.

1241
01:20:51,263 --> 01:20:55,433
Excuse me. Excuse me, ma'am.
What apartment?

1242
01:20:56,936 --> 01:20:59,896
- You're new.
- Yes, ma'am. What apartment?

1243
01:21:00,022 --> 01:21:01,814
I'm going to Peter Callaghan's
apartment.

1244
01:21:01,899 --> 01:21:03,525
And your name, please?

1245
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:06,444
Ashley Bartlett Bacon.
I am Peter's fiancée.

1246
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:10,532
You're not his fiancée.

1247
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:14,953
Hey, looking good.

1248
01:21:15,037 --> 01:21:17,205
Yeah, well, they're moving
me to the second floor.

1249
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:19,541
Great. Mind if I drove?

1250
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:21,876
No problem. See you by the elevators.

1251
01:21:21,961 --> 01:21:24,295
All right. Okay. There we go.

1252
01:21:25,756 --> 01:21:27,298
It's a little drafty.

1253
01:21:27,383 --> 01:21:29,926
Here, I brought you some contraband.

1254
01:21:31,178 --> 01:21:33,596
Chocolate peanut butter. Thanks.

1255
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:36,182
Hey, Lucy's pretty terrific, isn't she?

1256
01:21:36,267 --> 01:21:38,643
- Yeah.
- We're engaged, you know.

1257
01:21:39,186 --> 01:21:41,396
Yeah, I heard that.

1258
01:21:42,356 --> 01:21:44,315
Now, this, I remember.

1259
01:21:44,483 --> 01:21:47,569
Everything is better.
Everything looks better, feels better.

1260
01:21:48,821 --> 01:21:50,863
Even this chocolate peanut
butter tastes better.

1261
01:21:51,448 --> 01:21:53,616
Good. It's fudge mint.

1262
01:21:54,243 --> 01:21:56,411
Whatever. I'm reborn.

1263
01:21:56,829 --> 01:21:59,269
If you were a priest right now,
I'd confess everything to you.

1264
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:01,949
No, no, don't confess.
I'm trying to be positive right now.

1265
01:22:02,034 --> 01:22:03,376
Just eat your ice cream.

1266
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:05,962
I don't know what my secretary
sent Mom and Dad for Christmas.

1267
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:08,206
It was a fruit basket.
Now, look, I don't wanna...

1268
01:22:08,290 --> 01:22:10,608
- I've never been faithful.
- I'm gonna leave.

1269
01:22:10,926 --> 01:22:12,844
Remember the squirrels?

1270
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:15,179
Don't even say it.

1271
01:22:16,724 --> 01:22:19,350
First I knocked them out
of their nest with a rock.

1272
01:22:20,686 --> 01:22:21,853
Peter.

1273
01:22:22,062 --> 01:22:23,563
Then I saved them.

1274
01:22:25,316 --> 01:22:26,691
Did you say any of this to Lucy?

1275
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:29,485
That was in the past.
I'm making a clean start with Lucy.

1276
01:22:29,570 --> 01:22:33,781
She is... She is... She...

1277
01:22:36,327 --> 01:22:38,202
What is she?
She's...

1278
01:22:39,288 --> 01:22:41,789
I'd say that she gets under your skin
as soon as you meet her.

1279
01:22:41,874 --> 01:22:43,124
She drives you so nuts,

1280
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:47,211
you don't know whether to hug her
or just really arm-wrestle her.

1281
01:22:47,921 --> 01:22:51,674
She would go all the way to Europe
just to get a stamp in her passport.

1282
01:22:52,217 --> 01:22:54,594
I don't know if that amounts to insanity

1283
01:22:54,678 --> 01:22:58,431
or just being really, really likeable.

1284
01:23:01,226 --> 01:23:02,894
No, that's not it.

1285
01:23:03,854 --> 01:23:06,564
But she's gotta be really special.
She's gotta be.

1286
01:23:07,149 --> 01:23:10,151
And I can spend the rest of my life
finding out why.

1287
01:23:11,028 --> 01:23:13,738
I don't have to know now,
I don't have to know tomorrow.

1288
01:23:14,281 --> 01:23:17,659
I don't have to know in a year,
or 10 years.

1289
01:23:18,243 --> 01:23:19,894
I don't have to...

1290
01:23:19,979 --> 01:23:21,913
I don't have to have
all the answers today, or...

1291
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:23,289
Maybe someday I'll have a clue,

1292
01:23:23,374 --> 01:23:27,085
but it doesn't mean I can't
make a lifetime commitment.

1293
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:30,213
Does this make any sense?

1294
01:23:30,798 --> 01:23:33,758
Not really, but that's
common after a head injury.

1295
01:23:34,551 --> 01:23:35,593
My shoes.

1296
01:23:38,097 --> 01:23:40,264
- Hi.
- What'd they say?

1297
01:23:40,683 --> 01:23:43,101
- Who?
- The Callaghans. Are they inside?

1298
01:23:43,394 --> 01:23:44,977
You missed them.

1299
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:47,271
Well, what was their reaction
to the news?

1300
01:23:47,773 --> 01:23:50,566
- I didn't tell them yet.
- What do you mean, Saul?

1301
01:23:50,651 --> 01:23:53,569
- Now, what about Peter?
- Well, I didn't tell him either.

1302
01:23:53,654 --> 01:23:55,321
What?
You said you were gonna handle this.

1303
01:23:55,406 --> 01:23:57,031
- I'll handle it.
- This is handling it?

1304
01:23:57,116 --> 01:23:58,574
- This is handling it.
- Saul.

1305
01:23:58,659 --> 01:23:59,992
- What?
- You're fired.

1306
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:02,286
Fired?

1307
01:24:02,496 --> 01:24:04,038
- Sorry.
- Pardon me.

1308
01:24:12,381 --> 01:24:14,048
- Two, please.
- Four, please.

1309
01:24:25,811 --> 01:24:29,188
Dr. Biloxi, Dr. Biloxi to ICU North.

1310
01:24:29,273 --> 01:24:32,900
Dr. Biloxi, Dr. Biloxi to ICU North.

1311
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:34,986
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1312
01:24:36,155 --> 01:24:37,947
- Ashley.
- Scumbag.

1313
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:40,366
You're engaged?

1314
01:24:41,869 --> 01:24:45,538
May I remind you
that you proposed to me?

1315
01:24:45,622 --> 01:24:47,373
You said no. We broke up.

1316
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:50,918
No, no. I was confused.
We stepped back.

1317
01:24:51,003 --> 01:24:52,336
You moved to Portugal.

1318
01:24:52,504 --> 01:24:54,922
Yes, well, I didn't think
you were going to run out

1319
01:24:55,007 --> 01:24:57,383
and marry the first bimbo
that you came across.

1320
01:24:57,468 --> 01:24:58,551
Lucy's not a bimbo.

1321
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:00,678
Lucy?
Lucy who?

1322
01:25:02,097 --> 01:25:03,181
I don't remember.

1323
01:25:03,265 --> 01:25:04,557
Liar.

1324
01:25:05,601 --> 01:25:09,020
I don't remember proposing.
I was in a coma, I have amnesia.

1325
01:25:10,022 --> 01:25:12,857
Amnesia?
Well, now, that's rich.

1326
01:25:13,233 --> 01:25:15,651
All right, fine.
I want my stuff back.

1327
01:25:15,736 --> 01:25:16,861
Fine.

1328
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:19,155
- Then I want my stuff back.
- What stuff?

1329
01:25:19,490 --> 01:25:20,698
Your nose.

1330
01:25:21,867 --> 01:25:23,493
You can't take my nose back.

1331
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:24,869
I paid for it.

1332
01:25:25,245 --> 01:25:27,705
Well, then here. You paid for these, too.

1333
01:25:28,874 --> 01:25:31,501
Keep them. I'm a changed man, Ashley.

1334
01:25:32,711 --> 01:25:37,799
Go ahead. Go ahead and marry her,
you one-balled bastard.

1335
01:25:42,638 --> 01:25:46,766
Holy buckets, Peter.
Moving on to greener pastures.

1336
01:25:47,601 --> 01:25:48,851
Yeah.

1337
01:25:48,936 --> 01:25:50,228
You got it, pal.

1338
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:52,922
- So we should come back later?
- Yes, the doctor...

1339
01:25:53,190 --> 01:25:55,107
- Lucy, they moved him.
- They moved him?

1340
01:25:55,192 --> 01:25:57,193
Come with me, downstairs.

1341
01:25:58,195 --> 01:25:59,529
Lucy.

1342
01:25:59,905 --> 01:26:01,155
What?

1343
01:26:02,241 --> 01:26:03,866
- Lucy.
- Hi, Peter.

1344
01:26:03,951 --> 01:26:05,111
My God, you look really good.

1345
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,703
I feel really good. You know what?

1346
01:26:08,413 --> 01:26:10,832
Facing death makes a man
evaluate his life.

1347
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:13,974
And I've been thinking about mine
and haven't liked what I've seen.

1348
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:16,587
I've seen a man who has
courtside tickets to the Bulls,

1349
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:18,923
a lucrative investment portfolio.

1350
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:22,218
An apartment
on la rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré.

1351
01:26:22,302 --> 01:26:24,011
- Where?
- Paris.

1352
01:26:24,888 --> 01:26:27,306
But I've also seen a man
who has no one to trust,

1353
01:26:27,391 --> 01:26:29,267
no one to wanna have a son with.

1354
01:26:29,518 --> 01:26:31,936
You were there when I needed
someone the most.

1355
01:26:32,437 --> 01:26:34,146
You gave me a second chance at life.

1356
01:26:35,274 --> 01:26:38,943
It took a coma to wake me up.
My family loves you.

1357
01:26:40,237 --> 01:26:42,238
I might as well love you.

1358
01:26:42,656 --> 01:26:44,031
Lucy Eleanor Moderatz,

1359
01:26:45,784 --> 01:26:47,034
will you marry me?

1360
01:26:49,997 --> 01:26:52,039
Wanda?
Wanda, are you all right?

1361
01:26:53,292 --> 01:26:54,792
Honey?
Wanda?

1362
01:26:55,085 --> 01:26:57,253
Your hair is looking
very big tonight.

1363
01:26:57,337 --> 01:27:00,339
Why, thank you.
I love your new cologne.

1364
01:27:00,424 --> 01:27:03,050
Yeah, it's called Paris Guy.
It's from France.

1365
01:27:03,135 --> 01:27:04,256
- Nice.
- How you doing?

1366
01:27:04,303 --> 01:27:06,596
- Hey, are you going to see Lucy?
- Yeah.

1367
01:27:08,098 --> 01:27:10,391
She is the best-looking chick
in this building.

1368
01:27:10,475 --> 01:27:11,517
Hey.

1369
01:27:12,853 --> 01:27:17,064
But you are the best-looking chick
on the third floor.

1370
01:27:17,149 --> 01:27:19,567
- Joe Jr.
- Phyllis.

1371
01:27:26,116 --> 01:27:27,366
No?
This one?

1372
01:27:28,952 --> 01:27:29,911
This one?

1373
01:27:32,497 --> 01:27:34,498
I don't want any flowers from you,

1374
01:27:34,583 --> 01:27:36,709
I am not wearing black underwear,

1375
01:27:36,793 --> 01:27:39,462
and I definitely do not wanna
move in with you...

1376
01:27:40,923 --> 01:27:42,006
Jack.

1377
01:27:42,549 --> 01:27:44,091
Well, I don't have any flowers,

1378
01:27:44,176 --> 01:27:45,918
I wouldn't mind
seeing the black underwear,

1379
01:27:46,002 --> 01:27:49,113
but under the circumstances, I don't
think we should move in together.

1380
01:27:52,434 --> 01:27:56,103
- I thought you were Joe Jr.
- I get that a lot.

1381
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:01,317
Do you wanna come in?

1382
01:28:01,526 --> 01:28:02,693
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1383
01:28:11,078 --> 01:28:13,871
Wow. So that's the wedding dress?

1384
01:28:14,247 --> 01:28:15,915
The wedding dress.

1385
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:19,794
It works good as a tie, too.

1386
01:28:22,673 --> 01:28:23,839
Yeah.

1387
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:25,508
I just wanted to give you this

1388
01:28:25,592 --> 01:28:28,219
before all the presents
started to pile up.

1389
01:28:29,388 --> 01:28:32,139
I was dropping off some
furniture in Little Italy,

1390
01:28:32,224 --> 01:28:34,141
I look in a window, and...

1391
01:28:39,815 --> 01:28:43,067
Florence.

1392
01:28:47,072 --> 01:28:50,032
Thank you. It's really beautiful.

1393
01:28:53,161 --> 01:28:56,455
And I wanted to say that I think that

1394
01:28:56,832 --> 01:29:00,751
Peter is a very lucky guy.

1395
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:05,214
Thank you.

1396
01:29:05,382 --> 01:29:07,925
I had to say that because
you're gonna be my sister-in-law.

1397
01:29:08,468 --> 01:29:09,844
Ha, ha, ha.

1398
01:29:10,387 --> 01:29:13,931
I guess we'll be seeing
a lot of each other then.

1399
01:29:20,147 --> 01:29:22,023
- I'd better get going.
- Yeah.

1400
01:29:25,277 --> 01:29:27,236
Hey, Jack?

1401
01:29:27,612 --> 01:29:29,613
- Jack.
- Yeah?

1402
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:36,037
Can you give me any reason
why I shouldn't marry your brother?

1403
01:29:43,128 --> 01:29:44,378
I can't.

1404
01:30:06,651 --> 01:30:09,236
- What's this?
- It's a wedding invitation.

1405
01:30:09,321 --> 01:30:12,990
Wait a minute.
This is your wedding invitation.

1406
01:30:13,325 --> 01:30:14,408
So?

1407
01:30:15,786 --> 01:30:17,578
Whom are we marrying?

1408
01:30:17,954 --> 01:30:20,706
Jerry, Peter Callaghan.

1409
01:30:20,874 --> 01:30:23,584
The coma guy?
Are you insane?

1410
01:30:23,668 --> 01:30:25,169
Yes, Jerry, I'm insane.

1411
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:28,589
Every day I go and I sit in a booth
like a veal.

1412
01:30:28,673 --> 01:30:32,176
I work every holiday, I go home to a cat.

1413
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:35,554
And now a rich and handsome man
has asked me to marry him,

1414
01:30:35,639 --> 01:30:36,764
and I have said yes.

1415
01:30:36,848 --> 01:30:40,017
Okay, okay, that makes me
a raving, total lunatic.

1416
01:30:40,102 --> 01:30:42,144
The wedding is tomorrow, Lucy.

1417
01:30:42,229 --> 01:30:45,481
I know it's tomorrow, Jerry.
But I even wish it were yesterday.

1418
01:30:45,565 --> 01:30:48,859
That would mean that today
that I would be on my honeymoon,

1419
01:30:48,985 --> 01:30:51,237
that I would finally have a stamp
in my passport,

1420
01:30:51,321 --> 01:30:53,531
and that it would say Italy on it.

1421
01:30:57,119 --> 01:30:58,911
What happened with the other guy?

1422
01:31:01,581 --> 01:31:03,249
He didn't want me.

1423
01:31:16,721 --> 01:31:19,932
- Maybe she forgot.
- A woman doesn't forget her wedding.

1424
01:31:20,267 --> 01:31:21,851
Maybe she's stuck in traffic.

1425
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:24,540
- This isn't... Does this look ridiculous?
- No, you look fine.

1426
01:31:25,355 --> 01:31:27,881
- All right. Well, you got the rings?
- Yeah, I got the rings.

1427
01:31:27,966 --> 01:31:29,900
What's the matter with you, Jack?

1428
01:31:29,985 --> 01:31:31,694
You suck.

1429
01:31:34,573 --> 01:31:36,574
I suck or the outfit sucks?

1430
01:31:36,908 --> 01:31:38,492
It's a toss-up.

1431
01:31:38,952 --> 01:31:40,452
What do you mean?

1432
01:31:43,874 --> 01:31:45,457
Here she is.

1433
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:54,383
She's a little nervous.

1434
01:32:10,650 --> 01:32:12,109
She's lovely.

1435
01:32:36,676 --> 01:32:40,095
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
today to join...

1436
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:41,472
I object.

1437
01:32:44,643 --> 01:32:46,894
I didn't get to that part yet.

1438
01:32:47,229 --> 01:32:50,022
I would have to object, too.

1439
01:32:51,024 --> 01:32:52,441
What about you?

1440
01:32:53,109 --> 01:32:56,028
- I'm thinking.
- What the hell is going on?

1441
01:33:01,117 --> 01:33:03,035
I am in love with your son.

1442
01:33:03,995 --> 01:33:06,664
- I know.
- Not that one.

1443
01:33:08,541 --> 01:33:09,833
That one.

1444
01:33:10,710 --> 01:33:12,836
Jack, what the hell did you do?

1445
01:33:13,713 --> 01:33:16,340
He didn't do anything.
He didn't do anything.

1446
01:33:16,508 --> 01:33:18,509
It was me. It was all me.

1447
01:33:19,427 --> 01:33:22,012
Elsie, how are you doing?
You doing okay?

1448
01:33:24,766 --> 01:33:26,850
Do you remember
that day at the hospital?

1449
01:33:26,935 --> 01:33:28,815
Of course you remember
that day at the hospital.

1450
01:33:29,521 --> 01:33:31,563
Well, there was a little mix-up.

1451
01:33:31,731 --> 01:33:35,859
I saw Peter get pushed onto the tracks,
and I saved his life.

1452
01:33:36,361 --> 01:33:39,363
But when I got to the hospital,
they wouldn't let me see him,

1453
01:33:39,447 --> 01:33:45,035
so someone told the doctor
that I was his fiancée.

1454
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:47,037
Only...

1455
01:33:48,415 --> 01:33:49,873
It's not true.

1456
01:33:53,128 --> 01:33:55,045
I was never engaged to Peter.

1457
01:34:01,886 --> 01:34:04,054
Why didn't you say something?

1458
01:34:04,723 --> 01:34:06,307
Because I didn't know how to tell you.

1459
01:34:08,518 --> 01:34:11,353
We never even met
until that day on the tracks.

1460
01:34:12,814 --> 01:34:14,548
It's just when we were
in the hospital room,

1461
01:34:14,632 --> 01:34:17,735
everything happened so fast,
and I couldn't tell you the truth.

1462
01:34:17,819 --> 01:34:20,321
And then I didn't wanna
tell you the truth,

1463
01:34:20,405 --> 01:34:23,615
because the truth was that

1464
01:34:25,744 --> 01:34:27,369
I fell in love with you.

1465
01:34:27,454 --> 01:34:28,912
You fell in love with me?

1466
01:34:29,497 --> 01:34:32,207
No. No. Yes. All of you.

1467
01:34:33,793 --> 01:34:38,172
I went from being all alone
to being a fiancée,

1468
01:34:38,631 --> 01:34:42,259
a daughter, a granddaughter, a sister,

1469
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:45,220
and a friend.

1470
01:34:46,514 --> 01:34:49,141
I might have saved your life
on the tracks, but you know what?

1471
01:34:49,225 --> 01:34:51,101
You really saved mine.

1472
01:34:51,978 --> 01:34:54,188
You allowed me
to be a part of your family.

1473
01:34:54,606 --> 01:34:57,107
And I haven't had that
in a really long time.

1474
01:34:59,319 --> 01:35:01,445
And I just didn't wanna let go of that.

1475
01:35:04,708 --> 01:35:06,533
So even though
it was just for a little while,

1476
01:35:06,618 --> 01:35:08,619
I will love them always.

1477
01:35:12,832 --> 01:35:14,124
I'm very sorry.

1478
01:35:19,089 --> 01:35:21,215
And I'm very sorry about your carpet.

1479
01:35:25,553 --> 01:35:26,678
What about my carpet?

1480
01:35:26,763 --> 01:35:29,139
Peter Callaghan is engaged to me.

1481
01:35:29,224 --> 01:35:30,849
I object to this wedding.

1482
01:35:30,975 --> 01:35:32,184
Get in line.

1483
01:35:32,310 --> 01:35:34,019
And I object to your objection.

1484
01:35:34,104 --> 01:35:35,145
Who's that?

1485
01:35:35,313 --> 01:35:36,605
Ashley's husband.

1486
01:35:36,898 --> 01:35:39,233
You proposed to a married woman?

1487
01:35:39,567 --> 01:35:43,153
Yes, and I was in a coma
when my brother makes a play for my...

1488
01:35:43,947 --> 01:35:44,988
Sort of my fiancée.

1489
01:35:45,073 --> 01:35:48,242
- Peter, how could you do this?
- Listen, a deal is a deal.

1490
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:50,994
You two are better off together.

1491
01:35:52,622 --> 01:35:54,081
Stop yelling.

1492
01:35:56,668 --> 01:35:57,835
Hey.

1493
01:35:57,961 --> 01:36:00,337
Hold on.
Hold on, just hold it right there.

1494
01:36:24,028 --> 01:36:25,362
Hey, Luce.

1495
01:36:26,406 --> 01:36:29,867
I just wanted to say that I'm sorry

1496
01:36:29,951 --> 01:36:32,119
things didn't work out with that guy.

1497
01:36:34,873 --> 01:36:37,833
And, you know, right now,
you should get in touch

1498
01:36:37,917 --> 01:36:39,376
with the child within

1499
01:36:41,254 --> 01:36:44,173
and explore your feminine side.

1500
01:36:45,675 --> 01:36:49,219
And, you know, don't start eating
cookies and cake and stuff like that,

1501
01:36:49,304 --> 01:36:53,557
because you'll blow up
like my Aunt Roberta, you know?

1502
01:36:56,019 --> 01:36:57,728
You deserve better than that.

1503
01:37:05,737 --> 01:37:09,198
So how are things going
with Miss Third Floor?

1504
01:37:10,533 --> 01:37:11,742
She's...

1505
01:37:15,246 --> 01:37:17,789
- Joey, Joey.
- She said that I...

1506
01:37:19,292 --> 01:37:21,627
- What?
- Do you have any cookies?

1507
01:37:21,711 --> 01:37:23,337
No. You know what?

1508
01:37:23,421 --> 01:37:25,756
- We can try on some of my shoes.
- Okay.

1509
01:37:34,766 --> 01:37:37,434
- Hey. Last day?
- Yeah.

1510
01:37:39,504 --> 01:37:41,247
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I'm gonna miss you.

1511
01:37:41,331 --> 01:37:42,940
- We'll see each other.
- You better.

1512
01:37:43,024 --> 01:37:44,483
- Of course.
- All right?

1513
01:37:45,652 --> 01:37:46,985
- Bye.
- See you.

1514
01:38:02,961 --> 01:38:04,336
Lucy?

1515
01:38:15,473 --> 01:38:17,182
I need to ask you a question.

1516
01:38:18,017 --> 01:38:21,478
Get down on your knee.
It's more romantic.

1517
01:38:21,729 --> 01:38:24,147
He's proposing. Let him do it.

1518
01:38:24,232 --> 01:38:26,483
I am letting him do it.

1519
01:38:32,115 --> 01:38:34,575
Can I come in there, please?

1520
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,578
I can't.

1521
01:38:40,582 --> 01:38:42,040
Not without a token.

1522
01:38:54,512 --> 01:38:56,346
He just put the token in.

1523
01:38:56,431 --> 01:38:58,223
Really?
I didn't notice.

1524
01:39:02,186 --> 01:39:03,520
Marry me?

1525
01:39:04,272 --> 01:39:05,897
Yeah.

1526
01:39:06,691 --> 01:39:07,899
I love you.

1527
01:39:09,152 --> 01:39:10,736
I love you back.

1528
01:39:16,701 --> 01:39:19,369
- That's nice.
- I'm so happy.

1529
01:39:34,052 --> 01:39:38,347
So I had planned to marry
Peter, but I married Jack instead.

1530
01:39:39,515 --> 01:39:41,391
Thank goodness my father was right.

1531
01:39:41,476 --> 01:39:43,894
Life doesn't always turn out
the way you plan.

1532
01:39:46,064 --> 01:39:49,691
But Jack, Jack gave me the perfect gift,

1533
01:39:50,276 --> 01:39:52,194
a stamp in my passport.

1534
01:39:52,570 --> 01:39:54,863
He took me to Florence
for our honeymoon.

1535
01:39:55,740 --> 01:39:57,949
I guess you might say
he gave me the world.

1536
01:39:59,619 --> 01:40:02,996
Peter once asked me when
it was that I fell in love with Jack.

1537
01:40:03,206 --> 01:40:04,748
And I told him,

1538
01:40:05,124 --> 01:40:07,542
"It was while you were sleeping."
