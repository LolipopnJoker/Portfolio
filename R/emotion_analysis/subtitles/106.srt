The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1

5
00:00:18,492 --> 00:00:21,435
Childhood is not from birth to a certain age ...

6
00:00:23,474 --> 00:00:27,076
And at a certain age, the child is grown and puts away childish things.

7
00:00:35,612 --> 00:00:38,343
Childhood is the kingdom where nobody dies.

8
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,373
Jake! Jacob!

9
00:01:18,763 --> 00:01:20,242
Phil!

10
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:26,124
It's happening.

11
00:01:39,454 --> 00:01:41,224
Um, you just have to break them in.

12
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,042
I've been breaking them in. For three days.

13
00:01:44,818 --> 00:01:46,676
- Can I just go barefoot?
- No!

14
00:01:46,711 --> 00:01:48,214
Absolutely not.

15
00:01:48,249 --> 00:01:50,307
I'm just thinking it's a little much, you know.

16
00:01:50,582 --> 00:01:52,821
The dress, the shoes ...

17
00:01:53,287 --> 00:01:54,674
All of this.

18
00:01:55,622 --> 00:01:58,368
No, it's exactly enough.

19
00:01:58,403 --> 00:02:00,511
Tomorrow will be perfect.

20
00:02:01,142 --> 00:02:02,637
Where we do you want them boss?

21
00:02:02,672 --> 00:02:04,443
One either side of the aisle.

22
00:02:05,051 --> 00:02:07,614
- What aisle?
- Does no one have vision?!

23
00:02:25,606 --> 00:02:28,278
You! Go home and get lots of beauty sleep.

24
00:02:28,313 --> 00:02:29,734
That's an order.

25
00:02:30,808 --> 00:02:32,119
All right...

26
00:03:19,192 --> 00:03:20,900
I'm just checking for cold feet.

27
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:26,754
.....anymore****

28
00:03:26,983 --> 00:03:28,700
It's not too late to change your mind.

29
00:03:28,735 --> 00:03:30,927
What now you're having second thoughts?

30
00:03:33,635 --> 00:03:35,170
You are.

31
00:03:37,108 --> 00:03:39,966
I've been waiting a century to marry you, Miss. Swan.

32
00:03:40,974 --> 00:03:42,284
but..."

33
00:03:43,837 --> 00:03:45,346
but..."

34
00:03:46,543 --> 00:03:48,822
I haven't told you everything about myself.

35
00:03:48,857 --> 00:03:51,224
What? You're not a virgin?

36
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:02,109
Look, you can't scare me away now.

37
00:04:05,147 --> 00:04:07,741
Look, a few years after Carlisle created me

38
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:10,692
I rebelled against him.

39
00:04:12,191 --> 00:04:14,550
I've resented him for  curbing my appetite.

40
00:04:14,693 --> 00:04:17,144
So for a while, I went off on my own

41
00:04:17,677 --> 00:04:20,013
I wanted to know how it felt to hunt.

42
00:04:26,315 --> 00:04:27,954
To taste human blood.

43
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,317
All the men I've killed

44
00:05:13,943 --> 00:05:15,565
were monsters.

45
00:05:19,998 --> 00:05:21,582
And so was I.

46
00:05:26,286 --> 00:05:28,280
Edward, they were all murderers.

47
00:05:29,672 --> 00:05:32,494
You probably saved more lives than you took.

48
00:05:32,922 --> 00:05:34,865
Bella, that's what I told myself.

49
00:05:35,988 --> 00:05:37,734
but they were all human beings.

50
00:05:39,241 --> 00:05:42,645
I looked into their eyes as they died and I saw who I was.

51
00:05:43,474 --> 00:05:45,195
And what I was capable of.

52
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,930
And what I'll be capable of.

53
00:05:51,282 --> 00:05:53,147
Why are you telling me this tonight?

54
00:05:53,182 --> 00:05:55,834 
Did you really think this is going to change my mind about you?

55
00:05:55,869 --> 00:05:58,833
Just wanted you to change your mind about yourself.

56
00:05:59,513 --> 00:06:02,762
What you wanna see when you look in the mirror a year from now

57
00:06:06,147 --> 00:06:07,807
I know I can do this.

58
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,053
And let me tell you why.

59
00:06:10,177 --> 00:06:11,763
Because you did.

60
00:06:13,337 --> 00:06:15,327
You should give yourself some credit for that.

61
00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:18,035
And hopefully a year from now.

62
00:06:18,076 --> 00:06:20,460
I'm gonna look in the mirror and see someone like you.

63
00:06:22,538 --> 00:06:26,503
Someone capable of courage and sacrifice,

64
00:06:27,905 --> 00:06:29,221
and love.

65
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:36,113
"What is that?
- Come on! Let's go!

66
00:06:36,154 --> 00:06:38,539
I'm late for my bachelor party.

67
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:42,280
Send him out Bella, or we're comin' in after him.

68
00:06:43,266 --> 00:06:47,171
So this party.. will there be strippers?
"Boring!"

69
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,378
No, just a couple of mountain lions.

70
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:53,286
Maybe a few bears.

71
00:06:54,487 --> 00:06:57,058
Don't worry Bella, we'll give him back in plain time.

72
00:06:58,408 --> 00:07:00,562
Okay go, before they break my house.
"Let's go!!"

73
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:11,926 
I'll meet you at the altar.

74
00:07:13,982 --> 00:07:16,000
I'll be the one in white.

75
00:07:17,088 --> 00:07:19,186
Very convincing.

76
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:10,295
What did I say about beauty sleep?

77
00:09:10,397 --> 00:09:12,838
Sorry. Bad dream. 

78
00:09:14,442 --> 00:09:16,960
I mean, it's wedding jitters.

79
00:09:17,619 --> 00:09:19,404
- Do you Need some help?

80
00:09:20,433 --> 00:09:21,980
I could do her hair.

81
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,576
"Really?

82
00:09:28,071 --> 00:09:31,747
Please. I'm not offended by your choice of groom.

83
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:34,927
Just my plain lack of respect for mortality.

84
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,035
Essentially.

85
00:09:39,015 --> 00:09:42,148
Weddings, they bring everyone together

86
00:09:43,514 --> 00:09:45,730
Hey, did you find our daughter?

87
00:09:45,765 --> 00:09:47,993
Are those..graduation caps?

88
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:51,246
Ha! How creative!

89
00:09:52,538 --> 00:09:55,022
- Or weird
- Alice! Bella!

90
00:09:55,063 --> 00:09:56,518
In here, Mom.

91
00:10:01,352 --> 00:10:04,971
Oh My gosh! You are so beautiful.

92
00:10:06,848 --> 00:10:09,266
Oh crap, my mascara.

93
00:10:09,747 --> 00:10:11,319
Thanks!

94
00:10:12,332 --> 00:10:14,170
Charlie, get in here!

95
00:10:15,234 --> 00:10:18,307
Are you sure? I don't wanna...

96
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,620
I know. I look hot.

97
00:10:27,223 --> 00:10:29,297
We thought you needed something blue.

98
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:30,984
And something old.

99
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:33,614
- Besides your mother.
- Ugh. Thanks.

100
00:10:35,443 --> 00:10:38,746
- It was grandma's, once.
- But we added the sapphires

101
00:10:38,781 --> 00:10:40,802
It's beautiful, you guys.

102
00:10:40,837 --> 00:10:43,312
Wow, thank you so much

103
00:10:43,347 --> 00:10:45,643
That's your first family heirloom.

104
00:10:46,765 --> 00:10:50,571
You can pass it on to your daughter and her daughter.

105
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,670
Mom, I loved it.

106
00:10:58,705 --> 00:11:01,488
No smudging my masterpiece.

107
00:11:01,523 --> 00:11:03,251
She's right.

108
00:11:05,221 --> 00:11:06,845
Thank you.

109
00:11:09,844 --> 00:11:11,532
"Okay

110
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:14,917
Time for... the dress!

111
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,504
Do you want to see it?

112
00:11:32,405 --> 00:11:34,127
They have got to be related. 

113
00:11:34,615 --> 00:11:36,094
What a gene pool. 

114
00:11:36,314 --> 00:11:37,624
Seriously.

115
00:11:37,659 --> 00:11:40,694
You got some uh...drool.

116
00:11:42,944 --> 00:11:45,876
So, do you think Bella's gonna be showing?

117
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:48,379
Jess, she is not pregnant.

118
00:11:48,414 --> 00:11:51,451
Okay!  Who else gets married at 18?

119
00:12:14,419 --> 00:12:15,866
Ready?

120
00:12:23,069 --> 00:12:25,106
Just dont' let me fall, Dad.

121
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,382
Never.

122
00:14:32,546 --> 00:14:35,852
Ladies and gentlemen, we are gathered here on this glorious day

123
00:14:35,887 --> 00:14:37,561
to witness the union of

124
00:14:37,612 --> 00:14:39,845
Edward Cullen and Bella Swan.

125
00:14:41,068 --> 00:14:42,799
Please repeat after me.

126
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,346
"I, Edward Cullen ..."

127
00:14:45,381 --> 00:14:47,006
I, Edward Cullen ...

128
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,128
"Take you, Bella Swan ..."

129
00:14:49,163 --> 00:14:50,599
"Take you, Bella Swan ..."

130
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,572
"To have and to hold"

131
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,474
"To have and to hold"

132
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:00,456
For better or for worse.

133
00:15:00,491 --> 00:15:02,440
For richer or for poorer.

134
00:15:04,022 --> 00:15:06,238
In sickness and in health.

135
00:15:07,858 --> 00:15:09,493
To love

136
00:15:10,516 --> 00:15:12,221
To cherish

137
00:15:13,126 --> 00:15:15,254
....love

138
00:15:17,631 --> 00:15:19,091
I do

139
00:15:19,326 --> 00:15:21,046
I do

140
00:15:23,034 --> 00:15:24,343
I love you.

141
00:15:24,378 --> 00:15:26,142
I love you too.

142
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,294
I thought it would be bigger
- Yeah

143
00:16:33,545 --> 00:16:35,025
"Hi,
- Hi guys.

144
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,838
We were just saying how pretty everything is.

145
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:40,257
Thank you. You don't think it's too much?

146
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:43,128
- No!
- Not at all.

147
00:16:43,473 --> 00:16:46,003
Hey, man! Nice to see you!

148
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:48,020
- I'm happy for you.
Thank you!

149
00:16:48,516 --> 00:16:50,057
I hope you'll be happy, Bella.

150
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,656
Thank you, Billy.

151
00:16:52,531 --> 00:16:53,837
Have you heard from him?

152
00:16:53,872 --> 00:16:56,492
I'm sure Jake wishes you the best.

153
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:00,124
Or plan on getting drunk.

154
00:17:01,257 --> 00:17:05,580
They're serving up some pretty fancy champagne. Sue, can I get you a glass?

155
00:17:05,615 --> 00:17:07,606
Sparkling...

156
00:17:08,175 --> 00:17:09,735
Sounds great.

157
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,885
Bella!

158
00:17:14,945 --> 00:17:16,731
Congratulations! Bella


159
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:19,961
- Eleazar and Carmen, right?
- Hola!


160
00:17:19,996 --> 00:17:22,484
Yes. These are our cousins from Alaska. Tanya, Kate.

161
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:23,885
We've heard so much about you!

162
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,843
- Welcome to the family.
- Bienvenida!

163
00:17:26,162 --> 00:17:27,629
Thank you.

164
00:17:31,945 --> 00:17:33,443
Irina.

165
00:17:34,196 --> 00:17:36,004
Come meet Bella.

166
00:17:40,365 --> 00:17:43,069
I can't do this.
- You promised.

167
00:17:44,462 --> 00:17:46,829
They invited one.

168
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:54,173
Irina, he is our friend.

169
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,084
They killed Laurent.

170
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:58,022
He tried to kill Bella.

171
00:17:58,057 --> 00:18:01,552
I don't believe that. He wanted to be like us.

172
00:18:01,587 --> 00:18:04,105
To live in peace with humans,

173
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,060
with me.

174
00:18:06,225 --> 00:18:07,868
I'm sorry.

175
00:18:09,451 --> 00:18:10,986
Irina!

176
00:18:12,935 --> 00:18:14,689
Well, let's not monopolize the bride.

177
00:18:14,724 --> 00:18:16,885
Thank you.

178
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,834
Sorry."

179
00:18:19,758 --> 00:18:22,723
Well, what's a wedding without some family drama.

180
00:18:23,126 --> 00:18:25,441
Excuse me. Is this is on?

181
00:18:26,614 --> 00:18:28,238
Um, Hello!

182
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,251
Um, I'd like to propose a toast.

183
00:18:34,339 --> 00:18:36,174
To my new sister.

184
00:18:36,804 --> 00:18:40,637
Bella, I hope you've got enough sleep these past 18 years.

185
00:18:40,672 --> 00:18:43,102
Coz you won't be getting anymore for a while. Hahaha.

186
00:18:48,736 --> 00:18:51,467
Well, Bella was just like everybody else.

187
00:18:51,502 --> 00:18:54,972
totally mesmerized by Edward.

188
00:18:55,225 --> 00:18:57,894
Or the "Hair" as I call him

189
00:18:59,478 --> 00:19:04,102
And then suddenly, Edward is all about Bella.

190
00:19:04,794 --> 00:19:08,639
Eventhough she's not the captain of the volleyball team.

191
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,060
I'm Just kidding.  I'm Just kidding

192
00:19:11,095 --> 00:19:13,120
Or president of the Student Council.

193
00:19:13,165 --> 00:19:15,023
Edward will be a good husband.

194
00:19:16,846 --> 00:19:19,048
I know this because

195
00:19:19,105 --> 00:19:20,706
coz I'm a cop.

196
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,048
I know this..

197
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:26,529
Like how to hunt somebody

198
00:19:26,564 --> 00:19:28,358
to the ends of the earth.

199
00:19:28,853 --> 00:19:31,054
Now that you're my sister.

200
00:19:31,526 --> 00:19:34,215
You'll have to get over your ___ fashion

201
00:19:34,489 --> 00:19:36,565
And I know how to use a gun

202
00:19:37,531 --> 00:19:39,937
Skirts, heels, handbags.

203
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:43,959
Go to sleep, my love

204
00:19:44,209 --> 00:19:46,894
Go to sleep

205
00:19:48,149 --> 00:19:51,113
When you wake

206
00:19:51,382 --> 00:19:53,538
you'll see me

207
00:19:53,573 --> 00:19:56,164
I would like to thank Renee and Charlie

208
00:19:56,199 --> 00:19:59,107
for bringing such a wonderful person into the world ...

209
00:19:59,556 --> 00:20:01,189
And into our lives.

210
00:20:01,224 --> 00:20:03,638
We will cherish her and protect her forever.

211
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:06,040
It's an extraordinary thing

212
00:20:06,813 --> 00:20:10,674
to meet someone who you can bury your soul to

213
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,427
Adn accept you for what you are

214
00:20:16,655 --> 00:20:20,928
I've been waiting, for what seems like a very long time

215
00:20:22,127 --> 00:20:24,272
To get beyond who I am

216
00:20:26,145 --> 00:20:28,329
And with Bella

217
00:20:29,975 --> 00:20:32,192
I feel like I could finally begin.

218
00:20:36,654 --> 00:20:40,413
So I'd like to propose a toast to my beautiful bride.

219
00:20:43,447 --> 00:20:47,127
No measure of time with you will be long enough

220
00:20:49,272 --> 00:20:51,211
but let's start with "forever."

221
00:21:20,334 --> 00:21:22,390
Another one of your gifts just arrived.

222
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:24,252
What?

223
00:21:25,192 --> 00:21:26,513
Here, come on

224
00:21:27,967 --> 00:21:29,991
What's a wedding present doing out here?

225
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:32,463
Just a little more private.

226
00:21:33,477 --> 00:21:36,045
The best man didn't have time to get a tux.

227
00:21:36,868 --> 00:21:38,167
Jacob!

228
00:21:40,113 --> 00:21:41,498
Jacob.

229
00:21:43,531 --> 00:21:44,902
Hi!

230
00:21:46,736 --> 00:21:48,358
- Hi, Bella.
"Hey.

231
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,543
It's so kind of you.

232
00:21:50,578 --> 00:21:52,479
Kind is my middle name.

233
00:21:57,293 --> 00:21:59,329
I'll see if Rosalie wants to dance.

234
00:22:01,066 --> 00:22:02,427
Sorry I'm late.

235
00:22:02,462 --> 00:22:03,987
It doesn't matter.

236
00:22:05,007 --> 00:22:07,431
Everything is perfect now.

237
00:22:09,623 --> 00:22:11,231
Dance with me?

238
00:22:23,503 --> 00:22:24,883
Where have you been?

239
00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:29,677
___ put your face on a milk carton.

240
00:22:30,018 --> 00:22:31,965
I was in northern Canada.

241
00:22:33,362 --> 00:22:34,720
I think.

242
00:22:35,786 --> 00:22:38,182
It's weird going back to be back on two legs again.

243
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:40,188
With clothes.

244
00:22:40,413 --> 00:22:43,415
Didn't have time to practice with the whole human thing

245
00:22:46,381 --> 00:22:48,008
"Are you okay?"

246
00:22:50,364 --> 00:22:51,936
Being here.

247
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:57,490
Why? Afraid I'll crash the party?

248
00:23:06,525 --> 00:23:08,213
You're not the only one.

249
00:23:12,084 --> 00:23:15,003
i think I'll be used to telling you goodbye now

250
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:21,311
Come on, you're not supposed to be the one crying, Bella.

251
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:28,260
Everyone cries at weddings.

252
00:23:30,706 --> 00:23:33,144
This is how I will remember you

253
00:23:33,823 --> 00:23:35,738
Pink cheeks,

254
00:23:36,974 --> 00:23:39,235
two left feet ...

255
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:46,431
Heart beat.

256
00:23:48,828 --> 00:23:50,811
So, Soon I'm gonna be dead to you?

257
00:23:51,571 --> 00:23:53,042
No.

258
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:05,049
I'm Sorry.

259
00:24:05,084 --> 00:24:07,890
I'm just trying appreciate your last night as a human.

260
00:24:10,223 --> 00:24:12,044
Well, It's not my last night.

261
00:24:14,941 --> 00:24:17,304
I thought you..

262
00:24:18,211 --> 00:24:21,426
Didn't really want to spend my honeymoon writhing in pain.

263
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,476
Well, what's the point?

264
00:24:26,015 --> 00:24:29,107
It's not like you're going to have a real honeymoon with him anyway

265
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,422
It's gonna be as real as any one else's

266
00:24:31,457 --> 00:24:33,357
That's a sick joke.

267
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,821
You are joking.

268
00:24:37,718 --> 00:24:39,377
What, While you're still human?

269
00:24:39,412 --> 00:24:42,812
You can't be serious Bella. Tell me you're not that stupid

270
00:24:44,002 --> 00:24:46,170
I mean it's really none of your business.

271
00:24:46,205 --> 00:24:48,388
- No, you can't do this.
- Jake ...

272
00:24:48,423 --> 00:24:50,616
- Listen, to me Bella.
- let me go!

273
00:24:50,651 --> 00:24:52,617
Jacob, calm down. alright?

274
00:24:52,652 --> 00:24:54,837
Are you out of your mind? You'll kill her!

275
00:24:55,678 --> 00:24:57,934
- Walk away Jake!
Get off of me!

276
00:25:01,984 --> 00:25:03,421
Enough, Jacob!

277
00:25:04,291 --> 00:25:05,602
Stay out of this, Sam.

278
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:07,971
You're not going to start something that we have to finish.

279
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:11,195
- She'll die.
- It's not our concern anymore.

280
00:25:30,242 --> 00:25:31,585
Let's go, Seth!

281
00:25:36,446 --> 00:25:40,052
- I'm really, really stupid.
- No, it's alright

282
00:25:41,419 --> 00:25:44,178
Come on. They're probably miss us. Let's go back.

283
00:26:04,689 --> 00:26:07,316
So you really won't tell me where he's taking you?

284
00:26:07,351 --> 00:26:09,675
No, it's a surprise.

285
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:16,405
Well, wear hat and sunscreen.

286
00:26:16,606 --> 00:26:19,348
- Take care of yourself.
- I will

287
00:26:20,438 --> 00:26:22,057
Okay...

288
00:26:23,822 --> 00:26:25,690
I love you, Bella.

289
00:26:25,725 --> 00:26:27,245
I love you.

290
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,385
So much

291
00:26:37,661 --> 00:26:39,288
Thank you.

292
00:26:47,483 --> 00:26:49,546
Everything's packed and ready to go

293
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:51,432
Cool.

294
00:26:58,078 --> 00:26:59,602
I'm gonna go see him

295
00:27:09,488 --> 00:27:10,896
"Dad?"

296
00:27:19,412 --> 00:27:21,079
Well, it will be strange

297
00:27:21,899 --> 00:27:24,224
You're not under my roof

298
00:27:25,953 --> 00:27:27,311
Yeah. 

299
00:27:27,748 --> 00:27:29,796
It's gonna be strange for me too

300
00:27:32,185 --> 00:27:34,606
You know that this will always be your home, right?

301
00:27:43,378 --> 00:27:45,055
I love you, Dad.

302
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:46,646
Forever.

303
00:27:53,207 --> 00:27:54,941
I love you too, Bella.

304
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,129
Always have and always will.

305
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,798
All right...

306
00:28:08,341 --> 00:28:11,238
Go. You don't wanna miss your plane

307
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,336
Wherever its going

308
00:28:17,468 --> 00:28:18,810
Okay..

309
00:28:21,055 --> 00:28:22,482
Goodbye."

310
00:28:27,704 --> 00:28:29,290
Ready?

311
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,628
Yeah I'm ready.

312
00:30:38,805 --> 00:30:41,001
So we're not staying in Rio

313
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,242
No, just passing through.

314
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:46,433
Are we close?

315
00:31:02,731 --> 00:31:04,583
That's Isle Esme.

316
00:31:04,818 --> 00:31:06,734
It was a gift from Carlisle.

317
00:31:22,594 --> 00:31:25,156
Is this totally necessary?

318
00:31:25,757 --> 00:31:28,215
I'm nothing if not traditional.

319
00:31:42,794 --> 00:31:44,442
Want to take a look around?

320
00:32:34,377 --> 00:32:36,301
Are you tired?

321
00:32:42,144 --> 00:32:44,142
Do you want to go for a swim?

322
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,257
Yeah, that sounds nice.

323
00:32:54,101 --> 00:32:56,436
I could use a few human minutes.

324
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,795
Don't take too long Mrs. Cullen.

325
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:31,753
Okay.

326
00:34:08,489 --> 00:34:09,917
Alice!

327
00:34:32,098 --> 00:34:33,904
Don't be a coward.

328
00:35:27,105 --> 00:35:28,963
You're so beautiful!

329
00:35:49,289 --> 00:35:50,930
I promised I would try,

330
00:35:52,844 --> 00:35:54,752
but if this doesn't work ...

331
00:35:55,909 --> 00:35:57,688
I trust you.

332
00:36:42,902 --> 00:36:44,280
It's okay.

333
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:32,856
How badly are you hurt?

334
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,233
What?

335
00:38:46,721 --> 00:38:48,478
No, Bella. Look.

336
00:38:58,672 --> 00:39:00,809
Bella, I can't tell you how sorry I am.

337
00:39:15,391 --> 00:39:16,719
I'm not.

338
00:39:17,369 --> 00:39:19,496
Really, I'm not!

339
00:39:19,531 --> 00:39:21,131
Don't say you're fine.

340
00:39:22,477 --> 00:39:23,973
Just don't.

341
00:39:24,508 --> 00:39:26,102
No, you don't!

342
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:27,945
Don't ruin this.

343
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,987
I've already ruined it.

344
00:39:32,959 --> 00:39:35,987
Why can't you see how perfectly happy I am?

345
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:39,119
Or was, five seconds ago.

346
00:39:41,217 --> 00:39:43,209
And Now I'm sort of pissed off actually.

347
00:39:43,287 --> 00:39:45,139
You should be angry with me.

348
00:39:47,157 --> 00:39:49,304
We knew this was gonna be tricky, right?.

349
00:39:50,107 --> 00:39:51,955
I think we did amazing.

350
00:39:55,805 --> 00:39:57,793
I mean, It was amazing for me.

351
00:39:58,793 --> 00:40:00,482
That's what you're worried about?

352
00:40:01,147 --> 00:40:03,305
That I didn't enjoy myself?

353
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,483
I know it's not the same for you.

354
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:12,365
But for a human

355
00:40:12,406 --> 00:40:15,096
I can't imagine that it gets any better than that

356
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:23,387
Last night, was the best night of my existence.

357
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,763
You're the best.

358
00:40:48,044 --> 00:40:50,001
You're not gonna touch me again aren't you?

359
00:40:54,948 --> 00:40:57,127
You know that' s not what I mean.

360
00:40:57,401 --> 00:40:59,291
Let me make you breakfast.

361
00:43:12,413 --> 00:43:13,954
I win.

362
00:43:28,368 --> 00:43:29,704
Bella.

363
00:43:33,489 --> 00:43:34,945
Are you having a nightmare?

364
00:43:35,817 --> 00:43:37,282
No.

365
00:43:46,019 --> 00:43:47,708
It's just a dream

366
00:43:49,963 --> 00:43:51,800
And it's a really good dream

367
00:43:52,208 --> 00:43:54,026
Then why are you crying?

368
00:43:55,398 --> 00:43:57,793
Because I wanted it to be real.

369
00:43:59,346 --> 00:44:00,815
Tell me.

370
00:44:06,996 --> 00:44:08,557
Bella, I can't

371
00:44:12,228 --> 00:44:13,742
"Please..."

372
00:44:15,926 --> 00:44:17,477
"Please..."

373
00:44:50,918 --> 00:44:53,441
Maybe they'll say she was in a car crash.

374
00:44:54,222 --> 00:44:56,213
Or tripped and fell off a cliff.

375
00:45:04,441 --> 00:45:06,426
At least, I'll get one thing out of it

376
00:45:08,186 --> 00:45:09,639
No you won't

377
00:45:11,259 --> 00:45:14,284
The Cullens are not a danger to the town or the tribe.

378
00:45:14,958 --> 00:45:17,328
Well, he's either gonna kill her or change her.

379
00:45:17,429 --> 00:45:20,889
- And the treaty says ...
- I say, Jacob.

380
00:45:21,078 --> 00:45:22,464
I say.

381
00:45:29,211 --> 00:45:32,044
You know if you wanted things to be different, you should've become Alpha.

382
00:45:33,775 --> 00:45:36,625
Turning it down seemed like a good idea at the time

383
00:45:37,312 --> 00:45:40,923
Jake, you really think you could kill Bella if she comes back a vampire?

384
00:45:40,958 --> 00:45:43,740
No. He'll make one of us do it and held a grudge against us..

385
00:45:43,775 --> 00:45:45,357
Shut up, Leah.

386
00:45:45,392 --> 00:45:46,728
Would you just get over it?

387
00:45:46,881 --> 00:45:48,899
It's not like you've imprinted on her

388
00:45:51,453 --> 00:45:53,405
At least they seem happy.

389
00:45:55,354 --> 00:45:57,316
Yeah, some people are just lucky I guess

390
00:45:57,351 --> 00:45:58,923
Lucky?

391
00:46:00,434 --> 00:46:03,143
None of them belong to themselves anymore

392
00:46:03,178 --> 00:46:05,315
And the sickest part is..

393
00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:08,299
 their genes tell them they're happy about it.

394
00:46:08,912 --> 00:46:12,462
At least if you've imprinted on someone, you'd finally forget about Bella

395
00:46:15,751 --> 00:46:18,200
I mean, being any kind of happy is better 

396
00:46:18,245 --> 00:46:21,869
than being miserable about someone you can't have.

397
00:46:39,572 --> 00:46:42,609
Bella, these are our housekeepers, Gustavo and Kaure.
-This is my wife, Bella.
-Nice to meet you

398
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:52,154
Guess let's just leave them to it.

399
00:46:57,625 --> 00:46:59,055
What was that all about?

400
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:00,804
She's afraid of you.

401
00:47:01,213 --> 00:47:02,591
Why?

402
00:47:04,124 --> 00:47:06,901
Because I have you here, all alone..

403
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:09,891
you mean, She knows about you?

404
00:47:10,689 --> 00:47:12,305
She suspects.

405
00:47:13,555 --> 00:47:14,855
She's a native Ticuna.

406
00:47:14,896 --> 00:47:17,282
They have legends about blood drinking demons

407
00:47:17,323 --> 00:47:20,760
that prey on beautiful women.
- Monster!!

408
00:47:58,457 --> 00:48:00,943
I've gone to the mainland to hunt. Be back before you wake.

409
00:48:01,436 --> 00:48:03,026
You're late.

410
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:02,052
Bella.

411
00:49:03,725 --> 00:49:05,205
Don't come in here.

412
00:49:07,173 --> 00:49:08,826
You don't need to see this.

413
00:49:10,254 --> 00:49:12,412
In sickness and in health, remember?

414
00:49:13,693 --> 00:49:15,428
It must have been the chicken.

415
00:49:15,596 --> 00:49:17,298
Would you grab my bag?

416
00:49:33,558 --> 00:49:35,117
What is it?

417
00:49:38,128 --> 00:49:40,869
How many days has it been since the wedding?

418
00:49:41,192 --> 00:49:42,834
14, why?

419
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:47,088
Will you tell me what's going on?

420
00:49:48,365 --> 00:49:50,065
I am late.

421
00:49:50,949 --> 00:49:52,976
My period is late.

422
00:50:09,644 --> 00:50:11,342
That's impossible.

423
00:50:14,308 --> 00:50:15,973
Can this happen?
-Whoa.

424
00:50:34,028 --> 00:50:37,467
- Alice.
- Bella, are you alright?

425
00:50:38,223 --> 00:50:41,199
- I'm not 100% sure.
- Why? What's wrong?

426
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,784
- I just ...
You just what?

427
00:50:44,188 --> 00:50:46,968
- Alice, what did you see?
- Here's Carlisle.

428
00:50:47,019 --> 00:50:48,644
Bella, what's going on?

429
00:50:48,685 --> 00:50:51,273
I don't know. I'm a little worried. Can vampires go into shock?

430
00:50:51,617 --> 00:50:54,070
- Has Edward been harmed?
- No.

431
00:50:56,130 --> 00:51:01,022
I know that it's impossible, but I think that I'm pregnant.

432
00:51:07,753 --> 00:51:11,149
Carlisle, I swear something just moved inside me.

433
00:51:14,059 --> 00:51:16,982
Is this even possible?
- I don't know.

434
00:51:16,983 --> 00:51:18,283
What's he saying?

435
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,818
The sooner you get Bella home, the sooner we can find out what it is.

436
00:51:20,853 --> 00:51:24,038
Yeah, I will

437
00:51:28,581 --> 00:51:30,205
Well?

438
00:51:40,911 --> 00:51:42,426
Damn it.

439
00:51:43,334 --> 00:51:45,844
Kaure's making sure you're still alive.

440
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:14,945
What have you done with this little girl?

441
00:53:15,653 --> 00:53:18,285
- I know that you're a demon. You've killed this girl.
- What?
- People have legends. She might have seen this before.

442
00:54:12,825 --> 00:54:15,138
I will not let it hurt you.

443
00:54:17,849 --> 00:54:20,206
Carlisle will get this thing to you.

444
00:54:30,787 --> 00:54:32,782
The thing.

445
00:54:56,137 --> 00:54:58,007
Wait here.

446
00:55:23,725 --> 00:55:25,815
Hello?
- Rosalie.

447
00:55:26,144 --> 00:55:27,732
Bella?

448
00:55:32,024 --> 00:55:33,682
I need your help.

449
00:55:58,051 --> 00:55:59,772
Hey, son.

450
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:01,379
What's going on?

451
00:56:01,797 --> 00:56:03,468
Bella called him.

452
00:56:07,673 --> 00:56:09,448
Hey, haven't seen you in a while.

453
00:56:09,749 --> 00:56:12,576
Are you OK?"
- So you finally heard from Bella?

454
00:56:15,094 --> 00:56:16,856
They're extending their trip.

455
00:56:17,139 --> 00:56:18,623
It seems she caught a bug.

456
00:56:18,664 --> 00:56:21,929
They  wanna wait til she feels better before they travel.

457
00:56:22,283 --> 00:56:24,061
She's sick.

458
00:56:24,062 --> 00:56:26,821
She told me not to worry, but she sound..

459
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:31,261
I don't know.. off.

460
00:56:32,362 --> 00:56:34,486
She'll be okay Charlie.

461
00:56:35,104 --> 00:56:37,310
Come on, let's eat.

462
00:56:48,083 --> 00:56:49,458
Jacob.

463
00:56:49,791 --> 00:56:51,179
Let it go.

464
00:57:09,558 --> 00:57:12,221
Is it true?
- Hello, Jacob. How are you?

465
00:57:13,437 --> 00:57:15,656
Listen, just give it to me straight.

466
00:57:15,757 --> 00:57:17,565
Jake, is that you?

467
00:57:19,218 --> 00:57:21,711
She's here?
- They came home two weeks ago.

468
00:57:22,756 --> 00:57:24,494
Jake ...

469
00:57:43,998 --> 00:57:45,737
I'm Glad you came.

470
00:57:47,867 --> 00:57:50,519
- Close enough.
- What's your problem?

471
00:57:51,489 --> 00:57:53,013
Rose, it's okay.

472
00:58:04,046 --> 00:58:05,855
You look terrible.

473
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:11,736
Yeah. It's nice to see you too.

474
00:58:15,407 --> 00:58:17,721
So are you gonna tell me what's wrong with you?

475
00:58:20,751 --> 00:58:22,810
Rose, you wanna help me up?

476
00:58:41,396 --> 00:58:42,914
You did this!

477
00:58:43,115 --> 00:58:44,749
We didn't know it was even possible.

478
00:58:45,783 --> 00:58:47,696
What is it?
- I'm not sure.

479
00:58:47,737 --> 00:58:50,810
Ultrasound and the needles won't penetrate the embryotic sac.

480
00:58:50,811 --> 00:58:52,439
I can't see it either

481
00:58:54,511 --> 00:58:56,771
And I can't see Bella's future anymore

482
00:58:57,858 --> 00:59:00,530
We've been researching legends, but there is so much to go on.

483
00:59:00,531 --> 00:59:03,871
We do know that it's strong and fast growing.

484
00:59:04,094 --> 00:59:06,702
Why haven't you done anything? Take it out of her!

485
00:59:07,089 --> 00:59:08,865
This is none of your business dog.

486
00:59:08,906 --> 00:59:10,387
Rose!

487
00:59:10,488 --> 00:59:14,175
- All this fighting isn't good for Bella.
- The fetus isn't good for her.

488
00:59:14,523 --> 00:59:19,312
Say the word, Alice. "Baby". It's just a little baby.

489
00:59:20,013 --> 00:59:21,686
Possibly.

490
00:59:23,177 --> 00:59:25,424
Carlisle, you've got to do something.

491
00:59:25,465 --> 00:59:26,892
No.

492
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:30,205
It's not his decision. It's not any of yours.

493
00:59:30,246 --> 00:59:31,949
Jacob, I need to talk to you.

494
00:59:43,326 --> 00:59:45,430
I always knew you'd destroy her.

495
00:59:48,667 --> 00:59:51,427
She thinks Carlisle can turn her on the last minute.

496
00:59:52,152 --> 00:59:53,859
Like he did with me and Esme.

497
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:58,673
- Can he?
- The probability is.. slight

498
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:03,758
And if her heart fails..

499
01:00:10,119 --> 01:00:12,563
Jacob, I need you to do something for me.
- Huh.

500
01:00:14,096 --> 01:00:16,186
For her

501
01:00:19,054 --> 01:00:23,485
You have a connection with her that I'll never understand.

502
01:00:23,625 --> 01:00:25,341
Maybe you could talk to her,

503
01:00:25,525 --> 01:00:27,087
change her mind.

504
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:31,234
Anything to keep her alive.

505
01:00:33,016 --> 01:00:34,612
And if I can't

506
01:00:36,039 --> 01:00:37,867
If she dies,

507
01:00:37,868 --> 01:00:39,912
you will get what you always wanted ...

508
01:00:41,276 --> 01:00:43,328
To kill me.

509
01:00:53,939 --> 01:00:56,381
Rose, I'm fine. Really.

510
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:17,915
So Edward sent you in here to talk to me?

511
01:01:17,956 --> 01:01:19,256
Sort of.

512
01:01:19,303 --> 01:01:21,925
Though I can't figure out why he thinks you would listen to me

513
01:01:21,966 --> 01:01:23,878
I mean, you never had before.

514
01:01:31,923 --> 01:01:34,302
Since when are you and blondie BFFs?

515
01:01:34,343 --> 01:01:36,433
Rose understands what I want.

516
01:01:41,273 --> 01:01:43,361
What are you thinking, Bella?

517
01:01:43,998 --> 01:01:45,719
Seriously.

518
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:48,021
I know this seems like a scary thing

519
01:01:49,906 --> 01:01:52,068
It's not.

520
01:01:52,790 --> 01:01:55,020
It's like this miracle or something

521
01:01:56,377 --> 01:01:58,397
I can feel him

522
01:01:59,296 --> 01:02:01,394
So it's a bouncing baby boy.

523
01:02:01,914 --> 01:02:04,476
I'm sorry I didn't know. I should've brought some blue balloons.

524
01:02:04,677 --> 01:02:06,203
It's just a guess.

525
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:09,475
When I picture him I see a boy

526
01:02:11,548 --> 01:02:13,355
We'll see!

527
01:02:14,158 --> 01:02:17,669
- You won't
- Jake, I can do this.

528
01:02:18,427 --> 01:02:21,306
- I'm strong enough.
- Oh, Come on!

529
01:02:22,856 --> 01:02:26,639
You can spout that crap to your bloodsucker, but you don't fool me.

530
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:29,451
I see what that thing is doing to you.

531
01:02:29,591 --> 01:02:32,662
- It's a killer, Bella.
- You're wrong.

532
01:02:32,697 --> 01:02:35,957
And when you die, well, what's the point?

533
01:02:36,358 --> 01:02:38,919
Of me loving you. Of you loving him

534
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:41,044
How is that right for anyone?

535
01:02:41,245 --> 01:02:43,128
Coz I sure don't see it

536
01:02:43,329 --> 01:02:44,997
Live, okay?

537
01:02:46,464 --> 01:02:48,373
"Please..."

538
01:02:48,532 --> 01:02:50,872
Jake everything's gonna be okay.

539
01:03:04,463 --> 01:03:05,817
Jake, don't go.

540
01:03:06,714 --> 01:03:08,768
I know how this ends.

541
01:03:10,865 --> 01:03:13,346
And I'm not sticking around to watch.

542
01:03:50,919 --> 01:03:52,341
Jake, I can do this.

543
01:03:57,212 --> 01:03:58,687
I'm strong enough.

544
01:03:59,158 --> 01:04:00,740
Jake, don't go.

545
01:04:01,892 --> 01:04:03,581
You did this

546
01:04:03,682 --> 01:04:05,303
Jake everything's gonna be okay.

547
01:04:52,441 --> 01:04:55,292
What they created won't be able to control his thirst.

548
01:04:55,677 --> 01:04:57,608
Every human will be in danger.

549
01:04:57,649 --> 01:04:59,929
- We are ready.
- We'll handle it

550
01:05:00,130 --> 01:05:01,472
Now?

551
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:04,196
We must destroy it before it's born.

552
01:05:04,197 --> 01:05:05,700
You mean, kill Bella?

553
01:05:05,741 --> 01:05:08,492
Her choice, affects us all.

554
01:05:08,527 --> 01:05:11,833
Bella's human. Our protection applies to her.

555
01:05:11,868 --> 01:05:13,865
She's dying anyway!

556
01:05:18,224 --> 01:05:20,652
We have real enemies to fight tonight.

557
01:05:20,687 --> 01:05:22,624
"Tonight

558
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:27,448
You will fight with us, Jake.

559
01:05:47,353 --> 01:05:50,804
I am the grandson of the chief!

560
01:05:51,259 --> 01:05:55,595
I wasn't born to follow you or anyone else.

561
01:06:32,498 --> 01:06:34,288
Whoa. Don't worry. they're not following us.

562
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:35,874
What are you doing here?"

563
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:38,574
- I left Sam's pack.
- Go home, Seth.

564
01:06:38,609 --> 01:06:41,013
- I won't stand behind him
- Oh yes you will.

565
01:06:41,333 --> 01:06:43,890
I'm not kidding. Get out of here.

566
01:06:45,474 --> 01:06:47,382
Is that an order?

567
01:06:47,417 --> 01:06:49,147
Are you gonna make me bow down too?

568
01:06:49,182 --> 01:06:51,014
I'm not ordering anyone.

569
01:06:52,167 --> 01:06:54,692
I'm just going off on my own here.

570
01:06:54,733 --> 01:06:56,079
"Great!

571
01:06:56,114 --> 01:06:58,660
- I've got your back
- No you don't!

572
01:07:01,047 --> 01:07:02,881
If Sam comes after Bella,

573
01:07:03,367 --> 01:07:06,334
are you really ready to fight your own brothers?

574
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:08,164
Your sister?

575
01:07:08,861 --> 01:07:10,847
If it's  the right thing to do.

576
01:07:15,236 --> 01:07:16,544
Whatever

577
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:19,697
I'm gonna go give the Cullens a heads up.

578
01:07:20,367 --> 01:07:21,859
Do whatever you want.

579
01:07:26,004 --> 01:07:27,591
How cool is this?

580
01:07:28,052 --> 01:07:29,446
A two man pack.

581
01:07:29,481 --> 01:07:32,627
- It's two against the world.
- You're getting on my nerves, Seth.

582
01:07:32,696 --> 01:07:34,049
I'll shut up

583
01:07:34,084 --> 01:07:35,765
Can do

584
01:07:39,884 --> 01:07:41,222
Get ready.

585
01:07:41,993 --> 01:07:43,617
They're coming for Bella

586
01:07:46,812 --> 01:07:48,236 
I can smell them all the way out here

587
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:50,322
____What the hell are you doing here?

588
01:07:50,357 --> 01:07:52,327
I'm not gonna let my little brother get himself killed.

589
01:07:52,362 --> 01:07:54,988
Go away, Leah! I can take care of myself.

590
01:07:55,023 --> 01:07:57,070
Yeah you think so proves that you need a babysitter.

591
01:07:57,105 --> 01:07:59,065
Will the both of you shut up?

592
01:08:01,508 --> 01:08:04,515
- Did Sam send you?
-  Sam doesn't even know I left

593
01:08:09,368 --> 01:08:11,645
I think he just figured it out.

594
01:08:13,308 --> 01:08:14,692
Jake,

595
01:08:15,772 --> 01:08:17,842
I know what his plan is

596
01:08:18,664 --> 01:08:20,347
Sam lost the element of surprise

597
01:08:20,382 --> 01:08:22,524
and he doesn't want to take you on outnumbered

598
01:08:22,559 --> 01:08:24,664
so he's not gonna come at you head on.

599
01:08:24,699 --> 01:08:27,575
He's got the place surrounded and he'll wait for his opportunity

600
01:08:27,610 --> 01:08:29,200
He won't get through without a fight

601
01:08:29,235 --> 01:08:30,846
No fights.

602
01:08:30,881 --> 01:08:33,823
- We won't be the ones to break the treaty.
- The treaty is void

603
01:08:33,905 --> 01:08:36,685
- At least in Sam's mind
- Not in ours

604
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:40,396
Carlisle, no one's hunted for weeks.

605
01:08:41,544 --> 01:08:43,316
We'll make do.

606
01:08:46,370 --> 01:08:48,271
You've done us some great service Jacob

607
01:08:48,306 --> 01:08:49,925
Thank you."

608
01:09:20,211 --> 01:09:21,859
I know they're out there somewhere

609
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:24,761
but i can't hear them anymore

610
01:09:26,569 --> 01:09:28,326
It's so quiet ...

611
01:09:29,725 --> 01:09:31,334
i stopped hearing them too

612
01:09:31,369 --> 01:09:33,437
the second I decided to leave

613
01:09:35,168 --> 01:09:36,952
it's nice

614
01:09:38,625 --> 01:09:40,659
- You know you can't stay here.
"but i don't have..

615
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:43,165
I can't trust you with the Cullens

616
01:09:43,308 --> 01:09:45,355
You hate them too much

617
01:09:46,209 --> 01:09:49,204
- You don't even like me
- I don't have to

618
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:52,323
I just need to follow you

619
01:09:53,745 --> 01:09:55,904
Look, Seth doesn't want you here.

620
01:09:56,879 --> 01:09:58,367
And neither do I.

621
01:10:01,502 --> 01:10:04,349
Being unwanted isn't exactly a new thing to me.

622
01:10:20,848 --> 01:10:23,344
Look, I'll be stay out of your way
623
01:10:23,379 --> 01:10:26,325
I'll do whatever you want except go back to Sam's pack

624
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:29,538
and be the pathetic ex-girlfriend he can't get away from

625
01:10:30,969 --> 01:10:34,771
You don't know how many times I wish I could imprint on someone

626
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:36,866
Anyone..

627
01:10:39,496 --> 01:10:41,346
Just to break the connection

628
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:57,777
All right...

629
01:10:59,625 --> 01:11:01,382
I'm gonna do a perimter run

630
01:11:01,803 --> 01:11:03,367
You got my flank?

631
01:12:03,731 --> 01:12:05,183
Thank you."

632
01:12:09,806 --> 01:12:11,414
Her rib is cracked

633
01:12:12,518 --> 01:12:14,204
There are no splinters

634
01:12:14,526 --> 01:12:16,321
Didn't even puncture anything

635
01:12:16,738 --> 01:12:18,804
- Yet
- Edward.

636
01:12:20,677 --> 01:12:22,912
It's breaking her bones now

637
01:12:24,248 --> 01:12:26,695
It's crushing you from the inside out

638
01:12:27,954 --> 01:12:30,286
Carlisle, tell her what you told me

639
01:12:31,069 --> 01:12:32,792
- Tell her

640
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:36,327
Carlisle, tell me

641
01:12:36,754 --> 01:12:38,334
It's alright.
642
01:12:48,057 --> 01:12:50,748
The fetus isn't compatible with your body.

643
01:12:53,034 --> 01:12:55,283
It's too strong

644
01:12:55,290 --> 01:12:57,919
It won't allow you to get the nutrition you need.

645
01:12:58,229 --> 01:13:01,761
It's growing by the hour. I can't stop it and I can't slow it down

646
01:13:04,908 --> 01:13:07,980
At this rate, your heart will give out before you can deliver

647
01:13:12,614 --> 01:13:16,043
- Then I'll hold on as long as I can
- Bella ...

648
01:13:16,078 --> 01:13:19,227
There are some conditions that even venom can't overcome

649
01:13:20,310 --> 01:13:22,099
Do you understand?

650
01:13:23,008 --> 01:13:24,626
I'm sorry.

651
01:13:36,819 --> 01:13:39,325
Edward, I'm sorry.

652
01:13:39,569 --> 01:13:41,454
I can't live without you.

653
01:13:41,882 --> 01:13:44,106
You're gonna have a part of me.

654
01:13:44,504 --> 01:13:46,041
He will need you.

655
01:13:46,316 --> 01:13:48,881
Do you honestly think I could love it,

656
01:13:49,261 --> 01:13:52,608
or even tolerate it, if it killed you?

657
01:13:52,643 --> 01:13:54,731
It's not his fault.

658
01:13:55,291 --> 01:13:59,442
- You have to accept what is
- Because you've given me no choice!
659
01:13:59,926 --> 01:14:02,397
We're supposed to be partners. remember?

660
01:14:03,598 --> 01:14:05,368
But you decided this on your own.

661
01:14:05,943 --> 01:14:07,835
You Decided to leave me.

662
01:14:07,870 --> 01:14:11,183
- Don't see it that way
- I have no other way to see it.

663
01:14:11,218 --> 01:14:13,140
Because it means I'll lose you.

664
01:14:13,175 --> 01:14:15,594
And I don't choose that

665
01:14:16,443 --> 01:14:18,213
I don't choose that

666
01:15:19,428 --> 01:15:20,763
Are you cold?

667
01:15:21,404 --> 01:15:22,767
I got it.

668
01:15:30,722 --> 01:15:32,174
Don't do that.

669
01:15:32,942 --> 01:15:34,339
What?

670
01:15:34,586 --> 01:15:37,518
Smile. like I'm your favorite person in the world.

671
01:15:38,312 --> 01:15:39,800
You're one of them

672
01:15:42,626 --> 01:15:44,969
It feels complete when you're here Jake

673
01:15:59,427 --> 01:16:02,383
We need to find a way to get some food into her system

674
01:16:04,364 --> 01:16:07,002
- If I could only see the fetus ...
- Baby.

675
01:16:07,037 --> 01:16:09,420
Maybe I could figure out what it wants.

676
01:16:16,864 --> 01:16:18,718
I think you might be right.

677
01:16:18,915 --> 01:16:20,622
Jacob just had an idea.

678
01:16:22,715 --> 01:16:26,462
It wasn't an idea. It was a snide comment

679
01:16:26,497 --> 01:16:28,059
What were you thinking?

680
01:16:28,094 --> 01:16:31,712
That it's just  probably looking for someone to sink its teeth into

681
01:16:41,945 --> 01:16:43,768
He's thirsty.

682
01:16:45,732 --> 01:16:47,550
I know the feeling.

683
01:16:48,793 --> 01:16:51,329
If its craving, it's not gonna want animal blood.

684
01:16:51,417 --> 01:16:53,930
I have some O negative set aside for Bella

685
01:16:55,910 --> 01:16:57,230
Walk with me?

686
01:17:18,498 --> 01:17:21,268
Wait, wait, wait! You're gonna make her drink that?

687
01:17:21,799 --> 01:17:24,034
It 's the fastest way to test the theory.

688
01:17:24,414 --> 01:17:26,675
Only if you're comfortable with it

689
01:17:26,710 --> 01:17:28,491
I'll try anything.

690
01:17:29,912 --> 01:17:31,370
Just hold on.

691
01:17:32,894 --> 01:17:34,504
I think I'm gonna be sick.

692
01:17:43,143 --> 01:17:45,589
This will make it a little easy to take

693
01:18:15,726 --> 01:18:17,287
It tastes...

694
01:18:20,847 --> 01:18:22,336
good.

695
01:18:45,159 --> 01:18:47,648
Your pulse is already getting stronger

696
01:18:48,562 --> 01:18:50,193
It's working.

697
01:19:12,656 --> 01:19:14,696
- Well, you sound better.
- I am.

698
01:19:21,484 --> 01:19:23,648
He still walks on water, and all that?

699
01:19:24,222 --> 01:19:27,062
Yeah I mean it is different now
700
01:19:27,670 --> 01:19:31,374
The important thing is that you're better and that you're coming home soon, right?

701
01:19:31,702 --> 01:19:34,024
Okay Dad, I don't want you to freak out

702
01:19:35,290 --> 01:19:36,981
but..."

703
01:19:38,038 --> 01:19:40,068
I'm going to a medical center in Switzerland

704
01:19:40,103 --> 01:19:43,221
What? No, you're not going to Switzerland!

705
01:19:43,256 --> 01:19:45,772
- You said you were better!
"I am."

706
01:19:45,941 --> 01:19:48,520
No, Bella, I'm getting on a plane now

707
01:19:50,655 --> 01:19:54,459
No, It's really more of a spa

708
01:19:54,821 --> 01:19:58,228
And I'm sure that i'd be better by the time you got there

709
01:19:58,263 --> 01:20:00,479
Bells I don't know

710
01:20:00,738 --> 01:20:02,345
Dad, don't come.

711
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:04,335
Picture me healthy

712
01:20:04,370 --> 01:20:07,319
LIke I'm sitting on the couch with you, eating pizza.

713
01:20:07,354 --> 01:20:09,127
You want me to visualize?

714
01:20:09,168 --> 01:20:10,923
They say that it helps.

715
01:20:11,277 --> 01:20:13,196
Just picture me like that

716
01:20:15,424 --> 01:20:17,067
Like I was

717
01:20:17,102 --> 01:20:19,245
It will make me feel better

718
01:20:20,550 --> 01:20:22,283
Dad, I gotta go okay

719
01:20:22,318 --> 01:20:23,702
Bella ...

720
01:20:23,853 --> 01:20:25,965
- I love you.
- Bella ...

721
01:20:46,375 --> 01:20:48,418
I'm sorry I've been so angry

722
01:20:49,805 --> 01:20:51,211
I would be too.

723
01:20:52,136 --> 01:20:54,545
I've left you alone in this.

724
01:21:00,321 --> 01:21:02,109
Marriage.

725
01:21:07,062 --> 01:21:09,406
They say the first year is the hardest.

726
01:21:15,125 --> 01:21:17,724
- What was that?
"What?"

727
01:21:17,945 --> 01:21:19,777
I thought I just heard...

728
01:21:20,660 --> 01:21:22,287
Just say something else.

729
01:21:23,175 --> 01:21:24,869
Like what?

730
01:21:28,358 --> 01:21:30,036
Edward, what's going on?

731
01:21:32,145 --> 01:21:33,996
He likes the sound of your voice.

732
01:21:34,031 --> 01:21:35,812
You can hear him?

733
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:38,095
His mind.

734
01:21:40,605 --> 01:21:42,621
He likes my voice too

735
01:21:43,050 --> 01:21:44,430
It's weird ...

736
01:21:44,488 --> 01:21:47,345
I thought he was like me, but he's not. He's like you

737
01:21:48,053 --> 01:21:50,528
Good and pure.

738
01:21:51,450 --> 01:21:53,104
He's happy.

739
01:21:55,402 --> 01:21:57,508
Of course you are.

740
01:21:58,055 --> 01:22:00,879
Of course you're happy. How could you not be?

741
01:22:01,601 --> 01:22:04,115
I love you so much!

742
01:22:05,416 --> 01:22:07,561
What you do hear now?

743
01:22:08,002 --> 01:22:09,849
He loves you, Bella.

744
01:22:11,759 --> 01:22:13,763
My God!

745
01:22:37,782 --> 01:22:39,552
Jacob.

746
01:22:49,092 --> 01:22:50,545
So, That's the last of it?

747
01:22:50,580 --> 01:22:52,684
Bella could deliver tomorrow
748
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:54,760
If she's gonna have any chance at all, she needs more blood

749
01:22:54,795 --> 01:22:56,404
And you need to feed.

750
01:22:56,612 --> 01:22:59,373
You have to be at your strongest for her. We need to go tonight

751
01:22:59,408 --> 01:23:01,669
Carlisle, you're the enemy now

752
01:23:01,939 --> 01:23:04,555
Sam won't hesitate. You will be slaughtered

753
01:23:04,590 --> 01:23:06,365
Emmet will come with us

754
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:09,192
- That won't be enough
- We have no choice, Jacob.

755
01:23:09,227 --> 01:23:11,624
If there's anything we can do to save her, we've got to try

756
01:23:11,659 --> 01:23:13,282
You'd risk your lives for her?

757
01:23:13,317 --> 01:23:14,858
Of course we would

758
01:23:14,955 --> 01:23:17,571
Bella is a part of our family now

759
01:23:18,706 --> 01:23:20,396
Yeah

760
01:23:21,139 --> 01:23:22,878
I can see that

761
01:23:24,110 --> 01:23:26,032
This really is a family

762
01:23:29,438 --> 01:23:32,280
As strong as the one I was born into

763
01:23:34,979 --> 01:23:37,059
I know what I have to do.

764
01:23:57,928 --> 01:23:59,918
Jake, they're coming!

765
01:24:00,149 --> 01:24:02,223
I know
- We should phase Jacob
766
01:24:02,258 --> 01:24:03,893
We can't protect ourselves like this

767
01:24:03,894 --> 01:24:05,708
They'll see that as a threat

768
01:24:06,344 --> 01:24:08,050
I want to talk!

769
01:24:08,507 --> 01:24:10,813
It will be easier if I can hear you too.

770
01:24:19,942 --> 01:24:21,927
This isn't your territory anymore
771
01:24:22,518 --> 01:24:24,437
How's your new family working out?

772
01:24:24,472 --> 01:24:26,138
You done?

773
01:24:27,125 --> 01:24:29,139
You coming home, Jake?

774
01:24:29,483 --> 01:24:31,121
Not until I finish this

775
01:24:31,256 --> 01:24:32,556
What do you mean?

776
01:24:32,616 --> 01:24:34,869
I want Sam to take Seth and Leah back

777
01:24:34,904 --> 01:24:36,429
What? No way!

778
01:24:36,464 --> 01:24:38,226
Be quiet.

779
01:24:40,259 --> 01:24:43,792
I want them safe, and I want this over

780
01:24:54,939 --> 01:24:58,180
I need Sam to wait until Bella is separated from the problem

781
01:24:58,215 --> 01:25:01,108
- You mean 'til she's dead
- Ease up Paul

782
01:25:02,099 --> 01:25:03,454
Then waht>

783
01:25:03,489 --> 01:25:06,199
Tell Sam that when the time comes,

784
01:25:06,451 --> 01:25:08,210
I'll be the one to destroy it
785
01:25:08,245 --> 01:25:09,850
Jake!

786
01:25:10,297 --> 01:25:12,582
I am the only one who can.

787
01:25:13,452 --> 01:25:15,397
They trust me.

788
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:14,238
You played us!

789
01:26:35,742 --> 01:26:37,144
Thank you."

790
01:26:37,691 --> 01:26:39,920
- They make it out alright?
-Yeah

791
01:26:39,955 --> 01:26:41,671
Good.

792
01:26:50,515 --> 01:26:51,823
Hey

793
01:26:53,845 --> 01:26:55,148
Are you OK?"

794
01:26:55,183 --> 01:26:57,622
Yeah, it's not like I'm the one carrying a demon

795
01:26:58,338 --> 01:27:00,264
This is pretty important, Bella.

796
01:27:00,769 --> 01:27:03,108
Why don't you tell Jacob what you've decided

797
01:27:03,368 --> 01:27:04,854
What now?

798
01:27:06,381 --> 01:27:09,298
Rose  is trying to talk Bella out of her baby names

799
01:27:09,333 --> 01:27:10,905
She hates them.

800
01:27:10,940 --> 01:27:13,706
Well then I'm on your side no matter what you picked

801
01:27:14,605 --> 01:27:15,905
They're not that bad

802
01:27:15,940 --> 01:27:17,966
If a boy, EJ.

803
01:27:19,317 --> 01:27:21,025
Edward Jacob.

804
01:27:22,948 --> 01:27:25,602
Okay, fine. That one's not awful

805
01:27:26,569 --> 01:27:28,806
Why don't you tell them the girl's name?

806
01:27:30,261 --> 01:27:32,937
I was playing around with our mom's names

807
01:27:33,884 --> 01:27:35,452
Renee and Esme.

808
01:27:35,487 --> 01:27:39,157
And I was thinking, Renesmee.

809
01:27:44,141 --> 01:27:45,831
R-Renesmee?

810
01:27:49,021 --> 01:27:50,701
Is it weird?

811
01:27:52,397 --> 01:27:54,069
Well, that's not too weird.

812
01:27:55,364 --> 01:27:57,062
It's Beautiful!

813
01:27:57,876 --> 01:27:59,314
And it's unique

814
01:27:59,665 --> 01:28:02,008
It certainly fits the situation

815
01:28:04,235 --> 01:28:06,064
I like Renesmee.

816
01:28:10,625 --> 01:28:12,465
He likes it

817
01:28:33,663 --> 01:28:35,446
Rosalie, pass the morphine.

818
01:28:37,539 --> 01:28:40,441
Carlisle said the placenta must've detached

819
01:28:42,904 --> 01:28:45,682
- He's coming as fast as he can
- We'll have to do it

820
01:28:48,351 --> 01:28:51,011
Rose, let the morphine spread

821
01:28:51,046 --> 01:28:53,424
There's no time. He's dying.

822
01:28:53,459 --> 01:28:55,424
Get him out now!

823
01:28:56,379 --> 01:28:57,832
Look at me, Bella.

824
01:29:06,380 --> 01:29:07,852
Rosalie, don't!

825
01:29:09,033 --> 01:29:11,049
Alice, get her out of here.

826
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:12,431
Rosalie!

827
01:29:15,627 --> 01:29:18,578
- Save her! You gotta change her.
- I can't. Not while he's still in there.

828
01:29:18,613 --> 01:29:20,238
I gotta get him out first.

829
01:29:21,768 --> 01:29:24,077
Stay focused. Keep your heart beating.

830
01:29:24,549 --> 01:29:26,413
He's suffocating!

831
01:30:06,650 --> 01:30:08,555
It's Renesmee.

832
01:30:17,492 --> 01:30:19,095
You're beautiful!

833
01:30:57,822 --> 01:30:59,156
Bella.

834
01:30:59,855 --> 01:31:01,155
Bella!

835
01:31:02,627 --> 01:31:04,118
Bella!

836
01:31:10,978 --> 01:31:12,437
Jacob, take the baby.

837
01:31:12,472 --> 01:31:14,122
Get that away from me.

838
01:31:14,157 --> 01:31:15,612
Edward.

839
01:31:16,329 --> 01:31:17,847
I'll take her

840
01:31:18,638 --> 01:31:20,482
I promise I'm okay

841
01:31:29,161 --> 01:31:30,498
What is that?

842
01:31:34,310 --> 01:31:36,388
That's my venom

843
01:31:54,534 --> 01:31:56,607
It's supposed to be working

844
01:31:58,188 --> 01:31:59,891
Bella, come on.

845
01:31:59,926 --> 01:32:01,397
Come on.

846
01:32:02,348 --> 01:32:04,261
Come on.

847
01:32:09,728 --> 01:32:11,671
I won't kill you.

848
01:32:12,238 --> 01:32:14,176
That would be too easy.

849
01:32:14,211 --> 01:32:17,040
You deserve to live with this.

850
01:32:52,097 --> 01:32:54,038
She didn't make it.

851
01:33:07,999 --> 01:33:10,620
You're not dead. You're not dead.

852
01:33:11,770 --> 01:33:13,318
Come on!

853
01:33:14,905 --> 01:33:16,712
Come on!

854
01:33:23,693 --> 01:33:26,791
Come on!. It will work.

855
01:33:26,826 --> 01:33:28,904
Please, please.

856
01:34:14,507 --> 01:34:16,491
Come back to me, please.

857
01:34:16,986 --> 01:34:19,318
Bella, please.

858
01:34:50,617 --> 01:34:52,291
I don't care what he's done

859
01:34:53,151 --> 01:34:54,817
He's still my son

860
01:34:54,852 --> 01:34:56,327
I'm sorry, Billy.

861
01:34:57,001 --> 01:34:58,794
I just thought you should know.

862
01:35:04,363 --> 01:35:06,163
Bella is dead.

863
01:35:06,922 --> 01:35:08,610
It killed her.

864
01:35:11,363 --> 01:35:12,851
Let's go!

865
01:36:01,467 --> 01:36:04,965
It's like gravity.

866
01:36:05,683 --> 01:36:07,844
Your whole center shifts

867
01:36:10,462 --> 01:36:13,579
Suddenly, it's not the earth holding you down

868
01:36:14,630 --> 01:36:16,777
You would do anything,

869
01:36:16,812 --> 01:36:19,723
be anything she needs

870
01:36:21,365 --> 01:36:23,062
A Friend.

871
01:36:23,733 --> 01:36:25,348
A brother,

872
01:36:26,420 --> 01:36:28,068
a protector

873
01:36:48,855 --> 01:36:51,135
Alice! Jasper!

874
01:36:57,139 --> 01:36:58,522
You'll be fine.

875
01:37:12,269 --> 01:37:13,899
- We're outnumbered.
- By lots.

876
01:37:13,934 --> 01:37:16,309
I won't let them hurt my family.

877
01:38:33,541 --> 01:38:35,666
Stop it! It's over.

878
01:38:36,995 --> 01:38:39,195
If you kill her, you kill me!

879
01:38:53,437 --> 01:38:55,201
Jacob imprinted.

880
01:39:00,242 --> 01:39:02,086
They can't hurt her

881
01:39:02,396 --> 01:39:05,940
Whoever a werewolf imprints on, can't be harmed

882
01:39:10,369 --> 01:39:12,905
It's their most absolute law

883
01:39:48,828 --> 01:39:50,674
She shouldn't be this still.

884
01:39:52,103 --> 01:39:53,723
It's  the morphine.

885
01:39:55,024 --> 01:39:57,979
- Maybe I was too late
- No, Edward.

886
01:39:58,259 --> 01:39:59,995
Listen to her heart.
