1
00:00:34,765 --> 00:00:37,563
Come on, come on, come on.
All right, here we go.

2
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:52,346
Take a seat, buddy!

3
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,447
Come on.
It was a good play.

4
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:02,055
Are you gonna be
like this all day?

5
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,290
I don't know. Is it gonna
be like this all day?

6
00:01:03,365 --> 00:01:04,662
I don't know.
It's up to you.

7
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:05,859
I have no room to sit.
I got no room to sit.

8
00:01:05,934 --> 00:01:06,923
I'm sitting next to
a guy who's sitting

9
00:01:07,002 --> 00:01:08,435
like he's at home on the
toilet with his legs spread.

10
00:01:08,504 --> 00:01:10,062
Please don't crowd people.
Relax, please. Look at me.

11
00:01:10,139 --> 00:01:11,504
I am relaxed.
Look how I'm sitting.

12
00:01:11,574 --> 00:01:13,735
Why are you sitting like that?
Because... What do you think?

13
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:14,970
Why'd you wake me up
for this shit?

14
00:01:15,045 --> 00:01:16,774
Because I'm trying to relax
and have a nice day.

15
00:01:16,847 --> 00:01:19,247
Sweating in the sun
like a Tijuana whore.

16
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:21,214
Ice-cold soda!

17
00:01:22,187 --> 00:01:23,916
Get your soda here!

18
00:01:26,492 --> 00:01:29,017
On the right. Coming down there.
Pass that on down there.

19
00:01:29,095 --> 00:01:31,427
Hey, hot dog guy, can I get six
hot dogs down here, please?

20
00:01:31,497 --> 00:01:33,021
Right away.
And make it right, please.

21
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,261
You know, with the mustard and
the ketchup and the relish.

22
00:01:35,335 --> 00:01:36,768
Don't make me
hit you up for more.

23
00:01:36,837 --> 00:01:38,634
I thought we were going
to Wiener Circle after this.

24
00:01:38,706 --> 00:01:41,140
We will.
Then why are you getting hot dogs?

25
00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:44,440
Pass this down, please.
You can keep the change.

26
00:01:45,214 --> 00:01:46,340
Do you want
one of the hot dogs?

27
00:01:46,415 --> 00:01:48,246
You can have a hot...
You want a hot dog?

28
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:49,341
Do you want a hot dog, miss?

29
00:01:49,418 --> 00:01:50,646
No. Thank you.
You can have one.

30
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,051
That's okay. Go ahead.
You can have a hot dog.

31
00:01:52,122 --> 00:01:53,111
No, I don't want one.
Excuse me, sir?

32
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:54,554
Would you mind passing the
lady one of the hot dogs?

33
00:01:54,624 --> 00:01:55,682
I'm good, thanks.
You don't have to share.

34
00:01:55,758 --> 00:01:57,521
You can have your own. Thanks.
That's really nice of you.

35
00:01:57,595 --> 00:01:58,892
Just have one, please.
Okay, give me a hot dog.

36
00:01:58,963 --> 00:02:01,932
Somebody give her a hot dog. I got...
The big guy can't eat all of them. Have one.

37
00:02:01,999 --> 00:02:03,933
Have you ever had one before?
A hot dog?

38
00:02:04,002 --> 00:02:06,470
At the ballpark?
I have. I believe I have.

39
00:02:06,538 --> 00:02:07,596
Okay, good.
Thank you.

40
00:02:07,672 --> 00:02:09,503
Well, enjoy this one.
Thanks.

41
00:02:09,842 --> 00:02:11,673
Do you like mustard?
No, I'm okay.

42
00:02:11,744 --> 00:02:14,372
It's much better
with a topping. Here.

43
00:02:15,215 --> 00:02:17,376
I'm just kidding,
I'll give you two.

44
00:02:22,357 --> 00:02:23,984
Cheers!
Thanks.

45
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,290
We'll share it.

46
00:02:27,096 --> 00:02:30,259
It's a good dog.
I like the hot dog. I know.

47
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:32,225
That's nice.

48
00:02:32,301 --> 00:02:34,132
You have a problem with
me eating a hot dog, guy?

49
00:02:34,204 --> 00:02:35,796
I'm trying to watch the game
and have a hot dog.

50
00:02:35,872 --> 00:02:38,773
I'll smack him in his head.
No, just leave him alone.

51
00:02:54,327 --> 00:02:57,558
Hey, you want to go get a drink?
No.

52
00:02:57,798 --> 00:02:59,459
I'm with somebody, sorry.

53
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:01,797
Who? The guy with the tucked-in
shirt and the visor?

54
00:03:01,869 --> 00:03:04,667
What, is that like a brother?
The guy was not your brother, then.

55
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:05,933
Who is this guy?
He's not my brother.

56
00:03:06,007 --> 00:03:07,998
Who's this... I'm getting mad now.
I'm jealous. Who is this guy?

57
00:03:08,076 --> 00:03:09,543
Who are you? I don't know.
I'm kidding with you.

58
00:03:09,612 --> 00:03:11,637
Who's the guy with the tucked-in stuff?
Is that a boyfriend?

59
00:03:11,714 --> 00:03:12,908
Uh, it's...

60
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:15,280
I'm going.
Do you think you'll marry him?

61
00:03:15,351 --> 00:03:17,148
What? 'Cause I know
you've thought about it.

62
00:03:17,221 --> 00:03:19,712
The first time you laid eyes
on him, you probably thought,

63
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:23,248
"I wonder if I could marry this guy in plaid
shorts who tucks his shirt in. No way."

64
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,955
Then when you kissed him,
you said, "I can't believe it.

65
00:03:25,029 --> 00:03:27,691
"I had a lot to drink tonight.
I'm kissing the tucked-in guy."

66
00:03:27,766 --> 00:03:30,132
My point is, if you're not
gonna marry him... Yeah.

67
00:03:30,202 --> 00:03:31,362
...and if it's not forever,

68
00:03:31,437 --> 00:03:34,031
then you really don't have anything
to lose in taking me up on my offer.

69
00:03:34,107 --> 00:03:36,974
Uh-huh. Well, I'm gonna go.
Okay. Me, too.

70
00:03:37,043 --> 00:03:39,011
Okay. To where?
On an ice-breaking first date?

71
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,808
Well, no, I don't think...
Listen.

72
00:03:40,881 --> 00:03:42,746
If you want to stay off the
market while you're with

73
00:03:42,817 --> 00:03:45,217
I'm-not-the-one- but-I'm-comfortable,
then you can do that.

74
00:03:45,286 --> 00:03:46,685
But for all you know,
I just offered you

75
00:03:46,755 --> 00:03:49,246
a get-out-of-bored-love- for-free
card with no strings attached.

76
00:03:49,324 --> 00:03:50,757
God, you're crazy.
No, I'm not crazy.

77
00:03:50,826 --> 00:03:52,657
And a lot of times people go,
"Oh, that's crazy,"

78
00:03:52,729 --> 00:03:54,060
and then they go,
"It's genius."

79
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,825
That's what happened
when the person invented fire.

80
00:03:55,898 --> 00:03:58,958
They burned that witch. And guess what,
then they got warm and they ate good stuff.

81
00:03:59,036 --> 00:04:00,867
Now, where are we headed to?
Let's not make this weird,

82
00:04:00,938 --> 00:04:02,337
'cause I'm not good on dates.
No. You know what?

83
00:04:02,406 --> 00:04:04,271
I'm better just to kind of hang
out and, if we don't have fun,

84
00:04:04,342 --> 00:04:05,331
I might go my separate way.
Okay.

85
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,072
I'm not committing to anything.
I'll go hang out with you for a little bit.

86
00:04:08,146 --> 00:04:10,011
That's not gonna happen.
But I can't say for sure.

87
00:06:19,132 --> 00:06:22,101
<i>All right, all right, everybody.
Welcome to Three Brothers Bus Tours.</i>

88
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:25,161
<i>I'm brother number two.
It's good to have you here.</i>

89
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:27,298
<i>That's right, there's plenty
of seats here up front.</i>

90
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:30,811
<i>I promise I won't bite. I'm not a biter.
I'm psyched to have you here.</i>

91
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:34,337
<i>Okay, a couple quick ground rules.
Please don't jump off the bus.</i>

92
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:35,747
<i>Weird. Not fun for anybody.</i>

93
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:37,810
<i>Also, no throwing objects
at pedestrians,</i>

94
00:06:37,887 --> 00:06:39,752
<i>unless, of course,
they deserve it. Okay?</i>

95
00:06:39,823 --> 00:06:42,792
<i>We are not at work today.
We are on vacation today.</i>

96
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,055
<i>And if you can't blow it
out here on the big funny bus,</i>

97
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:46,687
<i>where the hell can you?</i>

98
00:06:46,764 --> 00:06:48,994
<i>I do split the tips
with my driver, Shondra.</i>

99
00:06:49,067 --> 00:06:50,659
<i>We don't want her back out
turning tricks.</i>

100
00:06:50,735 --> 00:06:54,136
<i>That was a weird time for everyone.
Seriously. Honest to God.</i>

101
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:56,539
<i>And I was a customer.
Long time ago.</i>

102
00:06:56,609 --> 00:06:59,077
<i>Come on, everybody,
let's get loose!</i>

103
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,346
<i>I'm gonna ask you once.
Show me that you mean it.</i>

104
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:05,647
<i>Don't make me ask you twice.
Are you ready to see Chicago?</i>

105
00:07:05,753 --> 00:07:07,812
<i>Are you ready to see Chicago?</i>

106
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:10,915
<i>That's what I'm talking about.
Shondra, put this baby in the air.</i>

107
00:07:10,992 --> 00:07:14,018
<i>Let's get the blood flowing.
Let's get everyone up and let's loosen it up.</i>

108
00:07:14,096 --> 00:07:15,495
<i>Coming up here,
you're gonna notice</i>

109
00:07:15,564 --> 00:07:18,590
<i>one of the only buildings
to survive the fire of 1871.</i>

110
00:07:18,668 --> 00:07:22,195
<i>That is the original Chicago Water
Tower and Pumping Station.</i>

111
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,273
Happy Holidays.
Marilyn Dean Gallery.

112
00:07:26,777 --> 00:07:29,075
The artist was inspired
by the neoclassical movement.

113
00:07:29,146 --> 00:07:30,135
No, she doesn't.

114
00:07:30,215 --> 00:07:32,979
But wanted to reflect it
with an abstract bent.

115
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:34,075
Okay, bye-bye.

116
00:07:34,152 --> 00:07:36,586
And how much is it?
$35,000.

117
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:40,454
Happy Holidays. Marilyn Dean Gallery.
Hold, please.

118
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:43,724
Will you excuse me for a moment?
Sure. Go ahead.

119
00:07:44,265 --> 00:07:45,391
Christopher?
Yes, sweetie.

120
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:46,728
Hi, honey.
Hi.

121
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:51,437
Christmas was months ago.
Don't remind me. I miss it so much.

122
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:56,474
Yeah, I know.
But today is not a holiday.

123
00:07:56,579 --> 00:07:59,446
I know for a fact that people
like my spirit on the phone

124
00:07:59,515 --> 00:08:01,346
and they dig the energy
that I give them.

125
00:08:01,418 --> 00:08:05,286
Okay. I'm just saying, I don't think
Marilyn Dean will "dig" the energy.

126
00:08:05,355 --> 00:08:08,188
Oh, no. She's the one that
told me to be creative. So...

127
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:10,819
I know. It's just... Okay.
What is the next holiday coming?

128
00:08:10,895 --> 00:08:12,385
The Fourth of July,
is that what's next?

129
00:08:12,464 --> 00:08:14,125
Well, if you want to get
technical, there's Memorial Day,

130
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:16,224
there's Flag Day.

131
00:08:16,302 --> 00:08:19,066
Some people recognize Father's
Day as a holiday. I don't.

132
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:23,701
I get it. I get it. Well, on those
days you can say, "Happy Holidays."

133
00:08:23,777 --> 00:08:26,007
Every other day,
"Good morning, good afternoon,

134
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,548
"good evening, Marilyn Dean Gallery.
" Okay?

135
00:08:30,117 --> 00:08:31,209
Okay.

136
00:08:33,355 --> 00:08:35,186
I'm so sorry about that.
Oh, no.

137
00:08:35,257 --> 00:08:38,954
So, now this is a new piece
by Zakrzewska.

138
00:08:39,028 --> 00:08:40,859
What do you think of this?

139
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:45,692
Can I be honest with you?
Please.

140
00:08:46,136 --> 00:08:48,730
Other than taking an art
history class in college,

141
00:08:48,807 --> 00:08:52,641
which I pretty much slept through, I
don't have the first clue about art

142
00:08:52,711 --> 00:08:56,408
or how to go about buying it.
I mean, like that painting.

143
00:08:57,249 --> 00:09:01,481
I mean, I don't see the point in buying
something that I could have done myself.

144
00:09:02,222 --> 00:09:04,656
Yeah. I completely agree
with you.

145
00:09:07,362 --> 00:09:09,227
You know, an art teacher
of mine once said,

146
00:09:09,297 --> 00:09:12,789
"Never buy a piece of art
that you don't have to have."

147
00:09:12,935 --> 00:09:16,336
You know, don't worry about who the
artist is or how much it's worth.

148
00:09:16,405 --> 00:09:20,307
I mean, you have to live with it every day.
You have to walk by it every day.

149
00:09:20,377 --> 00:09:23,904
You know, you have to really love it.
You have to really appreciate it.

150
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,777
It's kind of like
picking a mate.

151
00:09:31,223 --> 00:09:32,850
Hey, honey!
Hi.

152
00:09:32,924 --> 00:09:34,858
How's it going?
It's good.

153
00:09:34,926 --> 00:09:37,190
Oh, wow. You got a lot happening.
I know.

154
00:09:37,263 --> 00:09:40,061
Very exciting.
I am starving.

155
00:09:40,133 --> 00:09:43,034
Oh, careful. That's really...
That's very hot. Oh, that's hot, hot, hot.

156
00:09:43,102 --> 00:09:44,660
Yep.
Jesus.

157
00:09:44,738 --> 00:09:47,832
Hey, honey, you've got to really...
You should get ready, okay?

158
00:09:47,908 --> 00:09:49,398
Oh, you look great.
Thank you.

159
00:09:49,477 --> 00:09:51,877
Got a lot of nice stuff.
Got a pizza.

160
00:09:52,047 --> 00:09:54,015
All kinds of stuff.
Terrific.

161
00:09:54,082 --> 00:09:57,813
I just need you to decide what to...
You know, I did everything.

162
00:10:05,362 --> 00:10:06,886
Gary?
Yeah?

163
00:10:07,397 --> 00:10:11,891
Oh, come on! Really?
You got three lemons.

164
00:10:12,103 --> 00:10:14,264
What my baby wants,
my baby gets. You know that.

165
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:16,933
Yeah, but I wanted 12.
Baby wanted 12.

166
00:10:18,077 --> 00:10:20,272
Why would you want 12 lemons?

167
00:10:21,014 --> 00:10:23,175
Because I'm making
a 12-lemon centerpiece.

168
00:10:23,249 --> 00:10:26,275
So, no one's actually even eating them?
They're just show lemons?

169
00:10:26,353 --> 00:10:29,811
Yeah. They're just show lemons.
Shown in the center of the table.

170
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,050
I'm glad you find that amusing,

171
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:33,320
but I cannot fill a vase
with only three lemons.

172
00:10:33,395 --> 00:10:35,863
Well, can't you just use,
like, maybe a drinking glass?

173
00:10:35,931 --> 00:10:37,023
I'm not gonna use a drinking...

174
00:10:37,099 --> 00:10:38,760
We could have a smaller
version of a centerpiece.

175
00:10:38,835 --> 00:10:40,860
I'm not gonna use a drinking
glass for our centerpiece.

176
00:10:40,937 --> 00:10:41,995
You know what?
I've got an idea.

177
00:10:42,071 --> 00:10:45,268
Why don't we go ahead and scratch
the centerpiece idea altogether,

178
00:10:45,342 --> 00:10:47,207
because the chicken
that burnt my mouth

179
00:10:47,277 --> 00:10:49,177
could maybe use a little
bit of lemon on top of it.

180
00:10:49,246 --> 00:10:53,774
Guess what? Now we've made a better meal
versus something visually nice to look at.

181
00:10:55,553 --> 00:10:57,851
What are you do... What's happening here?
What are you doing?

182
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:00,483
What are you doing?
Oh, I had such a long day on the bus.

183
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,754
I need a little bit of down time.
My feet are killing me.

184
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,763
Gary, come on, my feet are killing me, too.
I'm exhausted.

185
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,799
I worked all day.
Went to the market.

186
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:10,268
I cleaned this entire condo and then I've
been cooking for the last three hours.

187
00:11:10,338 --> 00:11:12,465
Come on. Help set the table.

188
00:11:13,074 --> 00:11:14,200
Sweetheart.
What?

189
00:11:14,276 --> 00:11:17,473
You've done such a great job already.
Don't you want to finish it yourself

190
00:11:17,546 --> 00:11:20,037
and have that personal power
of that accomplishment?

191
00:11:20,115 --> 00:11:21,980
Set the table.
Listen to me.

192
00:11:22,051 --> 00:11:25,248
Do you think that
when Michelangelo, right,

193
00:11:25,321 --> 00:11:27,881
was painting the Sixteenth
Chapel, that he said,

194
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:30,688
"Hey, guys, you know, I did pretty
good on the first 15 chapels,

195
00:11:30,761 --> 00:11:32,888
"but why don't you help me
design this one?

196
00:11:32,964 --> 00:11:35,023
"And maybe you could help me...
Give me a brush

197
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,228
"and you guys can grab brushes, and we
can all make a great chapel." Uh-uh.

198
00:11:38,303 --> 00:11:41,500
No, he didn't. And you wanna
know what the results were?

199
00:11:41,574 --> 00:11:42,973
A masterpiece.

200
00:11:44,711 --> 00:11:48,772
Okay. It's the Sistine Chapel,
not the Sixteenth,

201
00:11:48,849 --> 00:11:53,445
and I bet when Michelangelo asked for 12
brushes, they didn't bring him three.

202
00:11:53,521 --> 00:11:56,081
Yeah. Okay, all the talking is
really starting to drain me,

203
00:11:56,157 --> 00:11:59,320
and now I'm gonna have to watch the
highlights later to see what I missed here.

204
00:11:59,395 --> 00:12:00,760
Honey, look, Gary, just...
Down time's important.

205
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,798
Gary, please just take a shower, okay?
Down time's important.

206
00:12:02,866 --> 00:12:04,094
'Cause this is what
I don't want to have happen.

207
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:07,364
I don't want the doorbell to ring.
I'm then forced to answer the door,

208
00:12:07,437 --> 00:12:09,405
entertain people,
and I'm still cooking dinner.

209
00:12:09,473 --> 00:12:10,565
Yeah.
Okay?

210
00:12:10,641 --> 00:12:14,577
You're absolutely right. Let's do that.
The second that this inning's over...

211
00:12:14,645 --> 00:12:16,169
Gary.
There's one out all ready.

212
00:12:16,248 --> 00:12:17,579
They're gonna be here
in 20 minutes.

213
00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:20,140
Baby, have you ever seen a shower of
mine take more than four minutes?

214
00:12:20,219 --> 00:12:21,243
Yes, I have. Come on.

215
00:12:21,321 --> 00:12:23,118
Oh, great!

216
00:12:23,623 --> 00:12:25,955
They're here. Okay. Table's not set.
Dinner's not ready.

217
00:12:26,025 --> 00:12:27,390
Would you please
just let my parents in?

218
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:28,951
I gotta jump in the shower.
What?

219
00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:30,519
I gotta go.

220
00:12:30,598 --> 00:12:32,225
Gary. Gary.

221
00:12:38,773 --> 00:12:40,968
Well, seeing how our families
haven't had many opportunities

222
00:12:41,043 --> 00:12:45,605
to get to know one another, we figured,
what better way than to break some bread?

223
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:49,015
So, everyone, thank you for
coming and enjoy the meal.

224
00:12:49,086 --> 00:12:51,486
Cheers.
Cheers, honey.

225
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,324
Mrs. Grobowski.
Nice to meet you. Thank you.

226
00:12:54,392 --> 00:12:57,520
Cheer with the sons.
Sweetheart, cheers to you.

227
00:12:57,596 --> 00:13:01,327
Darling, I see that you put
those Feng Shui books

228
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,595
that I sent to you to good use.

229
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:06,195
This place is so well balanced.
Thanks, Mom.

230
00:13:06,273 --> 00:13:08,264
Yeah, the energy in this place
is just amazing.

231
00:13:08,341 --> 00:13:09,399
Yes.

232
00:13:09,477 --> 00:13:12,173
Well, the energy in the condo
might be a little more amazing

233
00:13:12,246 --> 00:13:14,111
if we had a pool table.

234
00:13:15,751 --> 00:13:18,652
Gary, we've already
discussed that.

235
00:13:19,087 --> 00:13:21,521
We're gonna get a pool table
when we get a bigger place.

236
00:13:21,591 --> 00:13:23,786
The place is plenty big now, if you
wanted a pool table because...

237
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,725
Gary. Yeah.
You could take the dining room table,

238
00:13:25,795 --> 00:13:26,955
go ahead and move her
in the living room.

239
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,156
Really?
Plenty of room.

240
00:13:28,232 --> 00:13:31,030
And put a dining room table
in the living room? Okay.

241
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:34,070
How do you... I mean, what do you
do with a dining room table?

242
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:36,107
Eat on it. We'd have no
furniture in the living...

243
00:13:36,174 --> 00:13:37,732
Where's the furniture go?
All I'm saying is,

244
00:13:37,809 --> 00:13:39,299
it would be nice
to be able to shoot some pool.

245
00:13:39,377 --> 00:13:41,436
Well, this isn't a dorm.
Look, baby, I completely understand.

246
00:13:41,514 --> 00:13:43,004
There's halls and stuff.
I mean, you can go...

247
00:13:43,082 --> 00:13:45,710
We will wait and get a pool table
when we have a bigger place.

248
00:13:45,786 --> 00:13:47,151
Thank you.

249
00:13:51,826 --> 00:13:54,727
The food is outstanding.
It is delicious food.

250
00:13:54,796 --> 00:13:55,820
It's outstanding.

251
00:13:55,897 --> 00:13:57,762
Yeah, it really is nice.
Okay, everybody.

252
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:00,859
Time for the joke of the day.
Knock, knock. Dad. Dad, come on.

253
00:14:00,936 --> 00:14:02,233
Who's there?
Norma Lee.

254
00:14:02,304 --> 00:14:03,464
Norma Lee, who?

255
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:06,064
Normally, I don't go around
knocking on doors,

256
00:14:06,142 --> 00:14:09,873
but would you like to buy an encyclopedia?
I got a joke. I got a joke.

257
00:14:09,947 --> 00:14:12,177
How's it going?
I got a joke for you.

258
00:14:12,249 --> 00:14:15,980
What do you get when you cross
a gay Eskimo and a black guy?

259
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:19,620
All right, look, I think we've had
enough with the jokes for tonight.

260
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:21,989
Thank you, though.
Let's just talk with each other.

261
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,119
All right.

262
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,892
<i>I saw that Three Brothers
article in the Trib this week.</i>

263
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:28,490
Sounds like you guys are up
to some pretty exciting stuff.

264
00:14:28,569 --> 00:14:33,506
Basically, our big goal is to try to take
Chicago tourism by air, land and sea.

265
00:14:33,574 --> 00:14:37,032
We're still in the ground
phase with the buses.

266
00:14:42,251 --> 00:14:45,220
But as soon as we get
our infantry established,

267
00:14:45,287 --> 00:14:48,654
then we'll take it to the squids.
Yeah.

268
00:14:51,061 --> 00:14:53,291
Boats. Boats.
Oh, boats.

269
00:14:53,364 --> 00:14:56,492
As soon as we control the waterway,
then we'll bring in air supports

270
00:14:56,567 --> 00:14:59,434
and then we'll pretty much
control everything.

271
00:15:00,773 --> 00:15:02,434
You know, Dennis,

272
00:15:02,608 --> 00:15:06,339
the way your face lights up when
you describe your ambitions,

273
00:15:06,413 --> 00:15:08,278
it's really inspiring.

274
00:15:08,648 --> 00:15:12,414
Oh, thanks.
Because I understand

275
00:15:12,486 --> 00:15:15,319
how you feel that passion.

276
00:15:15,656 --> 00:15:19,057
And sharing it with other people,
I think that's what life's about.

277
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:22,358
I don't feel that about
boats and squibs... Squids?

278
00:15:22,431 --> 00:15:23,591
Squids.
Sorry.

279
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:27,067
Yeah.
But I do feel it about singing.

280
00:15:30,307 --> 00:15:33,970
<i>With my a cappella group,
The Tone Rangers.</i>

281
00:15:36,781 --> 00:15:39,375
Although it's not
as aggressive as your dream,

282
00:15:39,451 --> 00:15:43,444
it's really more of a brotherhood.
It's like a musical team.

283
00:15:44,223 --> 00:15:47,420
It's like a symphony of guys.
Guy symphony.

284
00:15:47,861 --> 00:15:51,160
And it's very hard
to describe the true magic

285
00:15:51,631 --> 00:15:55,465
of a group of guys
singing in perfect harmony.

286
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,631
It's transcendent.

287
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:00,064
But it's still very real.

288
00:16:01,844 --> 00:16:05,177
I guess the best way
to put it in words is just...

289
00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:22,628
Even that doesn't do it.

290
00:16:22,701 --> 00:16:25,932
That doesn't do it because
that's just one person.

291
00:16:26,005 --> 00:16:29,236
And what I'm talking about is
the pulse of the collective.

292
00:16:29,576 --> 00:16:31,476
Oh, heck. Let me just
show you how it's done.

293
00:16:31,545 --> 00:16:33,137
Dad, how about
a little percussion?

294
00:16:33,213 --> 00:16:35,477
Tap-tap-tappy.
Tap-tap-tappy.

295
00:16:36,451 --> 00:16:37,713
And, Mom, high-hat.

296
00:16:39,587 --> 00:16:42,385
Good, Mom.
Excellent. And Gary!

297
00:16:42,491 --> 00:16:46,257
On the kick drum! Come, come!
On the kick drum! Come, come!

298
00:16:46,328 --> 00:16:49,161
That's Gary! Come, come
with the kick drum. Come!

299
00:16:49,232 --> 00:16:52,963
Come, come with the kick drum.
Gary, on the kick drum. Come, come.

300
00:16:53,036 --> 00:16:56,904
That's Gary on the kick drum.
Go! And Gary. In the house.

301
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,066
Come, come.
I'm not with you.

302
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,474
Come, come. With the kick drum.
Come, come.

303
00:17:00,546 --> 00:17:02,173
I'm just not really
the kick drum kind of guy.

304
00:17:02,247 --> 00:17:05,705
I'd rather be just a listener and enjoy all
the banging that he's doing and the...

305
00:17:05,785 --> 00:17:09,152
You know, Gary, that's your prerogative.
That's your right, to listen.

306
00:17:09,222 --> 00:17:11,588
Meantime, I've gotta talk
to Brooke about something.

307
00:17:11,658 --> 00:17:13,353
It's called the bass line.
Excuse me. Okay.

308
00:17:26,242 --> 00:17:27,504
Good, Carol.

309
00:17:28,277 --> 00:17:29,574
Good, Brooke.

310
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,107
Yes, Dennis.

311
00:17:35,819 --> 00:17:37,684
Be nice.
Totally awesome.

312
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,021
<i>Move yourself</i>

313
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:44,995
<i>You always live your life</i>

314
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:48,463
<i>Never thinking of the future</i>

315
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:50,332
<i>Prove yourself</i>

316
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,098
<i>You are the move you make</i>

317
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:55,437
<i>Take your chances
win or loser</i>

318
00:17:55,509 --> 00:17:57,500
<i>See yourself</i>

319
00:17:57,778 --> 00:17:59,575
<i>You're every step you take</i>

320
00:17:59,647 --> 00:18:02,741
<i>You and you
and that's the only way</i>

321
00:18:02,818 --> 00:18:03,807
<i>Shake
Shake!</i>

322
00:18:03,885 --> 00:18:04,909
<i>Shake yourself</i>

323
00:18:04,987 --> 00:18:06,614
<i>You're every move you make</i>

324
00:18:06,689 --> 00:18:10,420
<i>So the story goes</i>

325
00:18:10,526 --> 00:18:11,788
Thank you so much.

326
00:18:11,861 --> 00:18:13,453
Okay, bye.
Thank you so much.

327
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,122
It was great to see you.
Okay. Come on.

328
00:18:15,199 --> 00:18:16,564
Have a good night.
It was really nice, Gary.

329
00:18:16,634 --> 00:18:18,659
Nice to see you. You, too.
Good to see you guys.

330
00:18:18,737 --> 00:18:20,068
Thanks, Brookie. Oh, honey.
Thank you, sweetie.

331
00:18:20,138 --> 00:18:22,732
You're still my favorite singer.
Stop it.

332
00:18:22,807 --> 00:18:26,868
Love you, sis. And I'd love for
you to come to a live performance

333
00:18:26,946 --> 00:18:30,211
of The Tone Rangers singing live.
That's something you'd really enjoy.

334
00:18:30,283 --> 00:18:31,307
It was good seeing you.
Okay.

335
00:18:31,385 --> 00:18:32,409
Thank you.
All right.

336
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,750
Bye, darling. Thank you for such a...
Okay. Okay, Mom.

337
00:18:34,821 --> 00:18:36,812
We'll see you soon.
Bye, dear. Thanks, darling.

338
00:18:36,891 --> 00:18:38,188
See you later.
Okay, buddy.

339
00:18:38,259 --> 00:18:40,489
Oh, now, are you sure that
we can't help you clean up?

340
00:18:40,561 --> 00:18:42,586
No, no. I think we're gonna be great.
We'll... Yes?

341
00:18:42,665 --> 00:18:44,189
So nice of you to offer,
but we got it. Thank you.

342
00:18:44,266 --> 00:18:45,995
Oh, it was such fun.
Great.

343
00:18:46,068 --> 00:18:47,330
I love you.
Great to see you.

344
00:18:47,403 --> 00:18:48,802
Good night, sweetie.
Thank you so much.

345
00:18:48,872 --> 00:18:49,497
I appreciate it.
Thank you so much.

346
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,702
All right, guys.
Bye-bye.

347
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,072
Bye-bye.
Thanks for coming.

348
00:18:53,143 --> 00:18:54,770
Love you, too.

349
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:02,609
<i>Are you blind?</i>

350
00:19:05,624 --> 00:19:07,785
<i>Oh, no, no! My demos!</i>

351
00:19:11,831 --> 00:19:14,322
Well, I'm gonna go do the dishes.
Cool.

352
00:19:15,602 --> 00:19:18,093
It'd be nice if you helped me.
Damn it.

353
00:19:18,172 --> 00:19:19,264
<i>Way to go!</i>

354
00:19:19,341 --> 00:19:21,707
No problem. I'll get them
a little bit later.

355
00:19:21,776 --> 00:19:23,767
I'm just gonna hit the streets
here for a little bit.

356
00:19:23,845 --> 00:19:25,005
Gary, come on,
I don't want to do them later.

357
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,844
Let's just do them now.
It'll take 15 minutes.

358
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,942
Honey, I am so exhausted.
I just honestly want to relax for a little bit.

359
00:19:30,019 --> 00:19:33,716
If I could just sit here,
let my food digest,

360
00:19:33,957 --> 00:19:36,824
and just try to enjoy
the quiet for a little bit.

361
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,554
Get some! Get some! Get some!
That's what happens.

362
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,962
And we will... You know, we can
clean the dishes tomorrow.

363
00:19:42,033 --> 00:19:44,433
Gary, you know I don't like
waking up to a dirty kitchen.

364
00:19:44,503 --> 00:19:46,971
Who cares?
I care! All right? I care!

365
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:51,002
I busted my ass all day cleaning this
house and then cooking that meal.

366
00:19:51,077 --> 00:19:53,477
And I worked today.
It would be nice if you said thank you

367
00:19:53,546 --> 00:19:55,480
and helped me with the dishes.

368
00:19:57,251 --> 00:20:00,448
Fine. I'll help you do the damn dishes.
Oh, come on. You know what?

369
00:20:00,521 --> 00:20:02,045
No. See?
That's not what I want.

370
00:20:02,124 --> 00:20:04,251
You just said that you want me
to help you do the dishes.

371
00:20:04,326 --> 00:20:08,558
I want you to want to do the dishes.
Why would I want to do dishes?

372
00:20:08,931 --> 00:20:11,365
Why?
See, that's my whole point.

373
00:20:12,201 --> 00:20:15,295
Let me see if I'm following this, okay?
Are you telling me that you're upset

374
00:20:15,372 --> 00:20:17,397
because I don't have a strong
desire to clean dishes?

375
00:20:17,474 --> 00:20:21,171
No. I'm upset because you don't have a
strong desire to offer to do the dishes.

376
00:20:21,246 --> 00:20:23,578
I just did.
After I asked you!

377
00:20:23,648 --> 00:20:27,448
Jesus, Brooke, you're acting crazy again.
Don't you call me crazy. I am not crazy.

378
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,885
I didn't call you crazy.
You just did.

379
00:20:28,954 --> 00:20:30,046
I didn't call you...
No, I didn't.

380
00:20:30,122 --> 00:20:32,090
I said you're acting crazy.
You know what, Gary?

381
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,491
I asked you to do one thing
today, one very simple thing,

382
00:20:34,561 --> 00:20:36,654
to bring me 12 lemons
and you brought me three.

383
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:39,893
God damn it. If I knew that it
was gonna be this much trouble,

384
00:20:39,967 --> 00:20:42,458
I would have brought home
24 lemons. Even 100 lemons.

385
00:20:42,537 --> 00:20:45,005
You know what I wish?
I wish everyone that was at that goddamn table

386
00:20:45,073 --> 00:20:46,597
had their own little private
bag of lemons.

387
00:20:46,675 --> 00:20:47,869
Honest to God!
Gary, it's not about the lemons.

388
00:20:47,943 --> 00:20:49,103
Well, that's all
you're talking about.

389
00:20:49,178 --> 00:20:51,646
I'm just saying it'd be nice if
you did things that I asked.

390
00:20:51,714 --> 00:20:55,480
It would be even nicer if you did
things without me having to ask you!

391
00:20:57,588 --> 00:21:00,682
Well, I do seem to remember doing
something for you this morning

392
00:21:00,758 --> 00:21:02,089
without you asking.

393
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,526
Gary, come on.
What? I'm serious. Come here.

394
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,530
You know what? I'm serious.
I really am. I am, too.

395
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,795
Come on. You knew I was working
today and I made that meal.

396
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:13,396
And you could have thought to yourself,
you know, you could have said,

397
00:21:13,473 --> 00:21:16,340
"Yeah, I think I'm gonna
get Brooke some flowers."

398
00:21:16,577 --> 00:21:19,774
You said on our very first date
that you don't like flowers,

399
00:21:19,847 --> 00:21:21,781
that they're a waste of money.

400
00:21:22,016 --> 00:21:23,278
Every girl likes flowers, Gary.

401
00:21:23,351 --> 00:21:24,579
You said that you
don't like flowers.

402
00:21:24,652 --> 00:21:26,847
I'm supposed to take that to
mean that you do like flowers?

403
00:21:26,922 --> 00:21:29,686
No. This is not about... You're not...
God, you're not getting it.

404
00:21:29,758 --> 00:21:32,124
You're not getting this, Gary, okay?
It's not about the lemons.

405
00:21:32,194 --> 00:21:34,560
It's not about the flowers.
It's not about the dishes.

406
00:21:34,631 --> 00:21:38,032
It's just about... How many times do I
have to drop hints about the ballet?

407
00:21:38,101 --> 00:21:40,399
You know I can't stand...
Brooke, come here.

408
00:21:40,471 --> 00:21:43,804
We've talked about the damn ballet.
I hate the goddamn ballet!

409
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:46,537
You got a bunch of dudes in tights
flopping around for three hours.

410
00:21:46,612 --> 00:21:48,546
It's like a medieval
techno show. It's a nightmare.

411
00:21:48,614 --> 00:21:50,275
I sit there in a sweat.
The whole thing, I do,

412
00:21:50,349 --> 00:21:52,442
wondering when the hell's the
goddamn nightmare gonna end.

413
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:55,113
Go to a damn ballet.
It's not about you loving the ballet, Gary.

414
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:57,383
It's about the person that
you love loves the ballet

415
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:59,449
and you wanting to spend time
with that person.

416
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:00,619
Not when they're at the ballet.

417
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,719
Okay. Forget the ballet!
Forget the ballet! I will.

418
00:22:02,797 --> 00:22:05,027
We don't go anywhere together.

419
00:22:05,967 --> 00:22:09,232
We just went to Ann Arbor together.
To Ann Arbor.

420
00:22:09,438 --> 00:22:11,429
To the
Michigan-Notre Dame game.

421
00:22:12,308 --> 00:22:16,938
You think screaming, drunk kids and
leprechauns doing backflips, that's fun.

422
00:22:17,014 --> 00:22:20,040
That's fun for me. Come on, man.
I did that for you.

423
00:22:20,117 --> 00:22:21,584
What do you...
How do you show up for me?

424
00:22:21,653 --> 00:22:24,315
I'm up on the bus
every goddamn day for you!

425
00:22:24,389 --> 00:22:25,981
Come on. You...
I'm busting my ass

426
00:22:26,057 --> 00:22:28,025
to be the best tour guide
in the damn city,

427
00:22:28,093 --> 00:22:30,152
so I can make enough money
to support both of us

428
00:22:30,229 --> 00:22:31,958
and hopefully you won't
have to work one day.

429
00:22:32,031 --> 00:22:34,192
I want to work.
All I ask, Brooke,

430
00:22:34,267 --> 00:22:36,360
is that you show a little bit
of appreciation.

431
00:22:36,436 --> 00:22:39,064
That I just get 20 minutes
to relax when I come home,

432
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:42,803
instead of being attacked with questions
and nagged the whole damn time.

433
00:22:42,877 --> 00:22:45,675
You think that I nag you?
That's all you do!

434
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,180
All you do is nag me!

435
00:22:47,249 --> 00:22:49,376
"The bathroom's a mess."
"Your belt doesn't match."

436
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,442
"Hey, Gary, you should
probably go work out."

437
00:22:51,521 --> 00:22:53,546
Nothing I ever do
is ever good enough!

438
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:56,649
I just want to be left
the hell alone!

439
00:23:03,868 --> 00:23:06,029
Really? Is that
what you want, Gary?

440
00:23:06,104 --> 00:23:07,435
Is that what you want?
Yeah.

441
00:23:07,505 --> 00:23:08,529
That's what you want?
Yeah.

442
00:23:08,607 --> 00:23:10,472
Fine. Great.
Do whatever the hell you want.

443
00:23:10,543 --> 00:23:13,774
You leave your socks all over
this house, dress like a pig,

444
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,381
play your stupid-ass video game.
I don't care, I'm done.

445
00:23:17,718 --> 00:23:19,948
What? I'm done!
I don't deserve this.

446
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,888
I really do not deserve this.
I deserve somebody who gives a shit.

447
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:28,657
I'm not spending one more second of this
life with some inconsiderate prick!

448
00:23:28,964 --> 00:23:30,488
You're a prick!

449
00:24:51,593 --> 00:24:54,960
Addie, it just became
so clear tonight

450
00:24:55,031 --> 00:24:57,056
how much he takes me
for granted.

451
00:24:57,533 --> 00:24:59,763
<i>What happened?
Just the same old shit.</i>

452
00:24:59,837 --> 00:25:02,032
I asked him to do one thing
and he didn't do it.

453
00:25:02,106 --> 00:25:05,200
Then he complained
that he had to do anything,

454
00:25:05,276 --> 00:25:07,870
and I just felt like
I had no choice.

455
00:25:07,946 --> 00:25:09,504
No, sweetie,
you did have a choice, okay?

456
00:25:09,581 --> 00:25:12,744
And it sounds like you made the right one.
You respected yourself.

457
00:25:12,818 --> 00:25:16,310
But it's just not what I want.
I don't want to break up with him.

458
00:25:16,388 --> 00:25:20,381
I don't. I just want him to say thank you.
I want him to want to do the dishes.

459
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,258
I just want him to want
to take me to the ballet.

460
00:25:23,464 --> 00:25:26,797
I want him to get me
12 lemons! You know...

461
00:25:28,436 --> 00:25:33,373
I just want him to care enough about
this relationship to want to work on it.

462
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:35,501
Okay, you know what?
I'm putting on my shoes

463
00:25:35,578 --> 00:25:38,069
and I'm gonna be there in 15 minutes.
No, Ad. Don't.

464
00:25:38,148 --> 00:25:40,616
Please, I really don't want to see anybody.
I really don't.

465
00:25:40,683 --> 00:25:42,048
But, look, I'm worried
about you, okay?

466
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:44,314
And I can hear you in there
banging around your dishes.

467
00:25:44,388 --> 00:25:47,186
And I don't want you getting out
your Clorox and your rubber gloves,

468
00:25:47,259 --> 00:25:50,228
and taking this out on the kitchen.
Look, look, look.

469
00:25:51,096 --> 00:25:55,795
Okay. Tonight just...
It just got a little out of hand,

470
00:25:57,069 --> 00:26:01,062
and hopefully
he's just gonna realize

471
00:26:01,141 --> 00:26:04,577
that he's got some changes
to make and he's gonna...

472
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:09,443
He's gonna come home
and apologize.

473
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,583
Okay?
That's what's gonna happen.

474
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:17,787
I feel like, I don't... You know, like,
you dress however you want to dress.

475
00:26:17,861 --> 00:26:19,192
You know,
do whatever you want to do.

476
00:26:19,262 --> 00:26:20,320
I'm done with the relationship.
Whatever.

477
00:26:20,397 --> 00:26:22,627
So, it's just kind of, "You're
done with the relationship?"

478
00:26:22,699 --> 00:26:24,132
Well, you're obviously
hurt about it.

479
00:26:24,202 --> 00:26:25,669
She got to you. You're hurt.
I'm not.

480
00:26:25,736 --> 00:26:27,294
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
She hurt you.

481
00:26:27,371 --> 00:26:28,531
Will you look at me?
I'm not heartbroken.

482
00:26:28,606 --> 00:26:29,937
I'm a little shocked.
I'm a little surprised.

483
00:26:30,008 --> 00:26:32,806
Gary, you're devastated.
Now, what's the name of the guy she's doing?

484
00:26:32,878 --> 00:26:34,607
I'm gonna solve your problem.
What's his name?

485
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,807
What are you talking about?
Have you checked her e-mail?

486
00:26:36,883 --> 00:26:37,941
I don't check e-mails.
I don't...

487
00:26:38,017 --> 00:26:39,678
You can get a program
that records keystrokes.

488
00:26:39,752 --> 00:26:42,277
It costs, like, 20 bucks.
Very easy to use. Okay?

489
00:26:42,356 --> 00:26:45,814
You get a password, you check her e-mail.
You find out everything about her.

490
00:26:45,893 --> 00:26:47,190
That's how I found out
about the Puerto Rican

491
00:26:47,261 --> 00:26:48,853
that Stacy was running around with.
Okay.

492
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,921
You are reading a little too
much into this situation.

493
00:26:50,999 --> 00:26:52,660
There is no one she's
running around with, okay?

494
00:26:52,734 --> 00:26:54,099
We had a fight over the
groceries I brought home.

495
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:56,229
You're probably right.
She's probably not sleeping with anybody.

496
00:26:56,305 --> 00:26:57,636
No. Not what it's about.
Okay.

497
00:26:57,707 --> 00:26:59,231
Maybe she's with another guy, maybe not.
She's not.

498
00:26:59,308 --> 00:27:01,742
I don't know.
I'm not Columbo. Okay?

499
00:27:01,812 --> 00:27:05,475
But what we do know is that she
doesn't want to be with you anymore.

500
00:27:08,219 --> 00:27:11,620
I mean, I hate to be shitty about it,
and so cut and dry, but let's face it.

501
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:14,750
She says she doesn't want to be
with you, and I believe her.

502
00:27:14,827 --> 00:27:16,852
Now, we gotta figure it out.
And you're gonna need a place to go

503
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:19,090
and lick your wounds while you get
your head right over this thing.

504
00:27:19,165 --> 00:27:20,291
I don't need a place to go
and lick my wounds.

505
00:27:20,367 --> 00:27:21,391
You're gonna stay with me.

506
00:27:21,468 --> 00:27:22,833
I'm not gonna hear it.
Look it...

507
00:27:22,903 --> 00:27:24,894
I'm not moving out of the place.
Oh, you're not moving out.

508
00:27:24,972 --> 00:27:26,906
No. I put money in the place.
I put half my money in the place.

509
00:27:26,974 --> 00:27:29,340
You're obviously not the one
calling the shots in this case.

510
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:31,401
Yeah, but I own the place.

511
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,640
With her.
Yeah.

512
00:27:32,714 --> 00:27:34,477
But it's not up to her who gets
to keep the goddamn place.

513
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:36,710
If you find out who she's sleeping
with, maybe we could leverage it.

514
00:27:36,786 --> 00:27:38,413
I want you to listen to me.
You listen to me.

515
00:27:38,488 --> 00:27:39,853
I'm gonna leave you a key.
I don't need a key.

516
00:27:39,923 --> 00:27:41,151
Why?
'Cause she's gonna put...

517
00:27:41,224 --> 00:27:42,657
She's gonna move out
of the place, Johnny.

518
00:27:42,726 --> 00:27:45,217
Did she say she was moving out?
She will. She's gonna move out.

519
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:46,923
Oh, she's...
I'm gonna keep the place.

520
00:27:46,997 --> 00:27:48,487
I'm not moving
out of the place.

521
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:50,090
I'll leave you a key.

522
00:29:19,372 --> 00:29:21,567
Hey, how's it going?
I almost got it.

523
00:29:21,641 --> 00:29:23,506
Yeah.
You know, I was thinking.

524
00:29:23,576 --> 00:29:24,941
You know what you should do,

525
00:29:25,012 --> 00:29:26,877
is you should find somebody
who looks like Brooke,

526
00:29:26,947 --> 00:29:29,313
but even hotter and, you know,
bang the shit out of her.

527
00:29:29,383 --> 00:29:32,011
What the hell's wrong with you?
What?

528
00:29:33,088 --> 00:29:34,749
Logs.
Just fix the damn engine.

529
00:29:34,823 --> 00:29:37,383
I am fixing the goddamn engine.
I need your tour logs.

530
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,155
I'm off the clock, okay?

531
00:29:39,228 --> 00:29:43,494
Well, I cannot file the quarterlies
until I have your log.

532
00:29:43,567 --> 00:29:45,592
I'm going through a little bit
of a life change here, Dennis.

533
00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:49,503
I would really appreciate a little
bit of sensitivity, please.

534
00:29:53,845 --> 00:29:56,678
I know they're both French, but
that has nothing to do with it.

535
00:29:56,749 --> 00:30:00,617
Because Manet was earlier and... No.
Monet and Manet are very different things.

536
00:30:00,686 --> 00:30:01,983
I'm sorry, I beg to differ.

537
00:30:02,055 --> 00:30:04,455
Excuse me, sir, can I have her
call you back personally?

538
00:30:04,524 --> 00:30:07,015
Yes. Okay, thank you.
Sorry. Brooke?

539
00:30:09,063 --> 00:30:11,463
I am so sorry.
What?

540
00:30:12,233 --> 00:30:13,325
Come here.

541
00:30:14,236 --> 00:30:17,228
Oh, honey, your mom called
and told me everything.

542
00:30:17,306 --> 00:30:18,671
Oh, Jesus.

543
00:30:21,311 --> 00:30:23,541
Good morning, Marilyn.

544
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,249
Morning.
I'll go water the plants.

545
00:30:28,686 --> 00:30:31,621
I understand you had a long night.
Tell me everything.

546
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:33,123
"Everything."
I couldn't possibly...

547
00:30:33,191 --> 00:30:34,852
Then don't.
My time is pressing.

548
00:30:34,926 --> 00:30:37,292
What I want is for you to
take the rest of the day off.

549
00:30:37,362 --> 00:30:39,421
Oh, no.
No, that's not necessary.

550
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,867
Who am I?

551
00:30:43,603 --> 00:30:45,935
Marilyn Dean.
And where are we?

552
00:30:47,641 --> 00:30:51,543
The Marilyn Dean Gallery.
And of whom is that portrait?

553
00:30:56,685 --> 00:31:00,212
That is Marilyn Dean.
Yeah.

554
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:05,692
You know, your personal life
is your personal life.

555
00:31:06,263 --> 00:31:08,993
But you look like shit.
And when you look like shit,

556
00:31:09,066 --> 00:31:12,365
Marilyn Dean looks like shit,
and now it is my business.

557
00:31:12,436 --> 00:31:16,429
And when it comes to my business, I
don't like anything that's distracting.

558
00:31:16,909 --> 00:31:20,675
So, I want you to take the
rest of the day off to be sad

559
00:31:21,748 --> 00:31:25,309
and then come back to work tomorrow
ready to take care of business.

560
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:27,079
Got it?

561
00:32:00,292 --> 00:32:02,192
Oh, hey, Brooke. How are you?

562
00:32:02,929 --> 00:32:04,954
What the hell are you doing?

563
00:32:05,031 --> 00:32:08,933
Well, my whole life, I always wanted
my own place with my own pool table.

564
00:32:09,003 --> 00:32:10,493
I finally got my own place,

565
00:32:10,571 --> 00:32:13,938
but you would not allow me
to have a pool table.

566
00:32:14,542 --> 00:32:18,808
I just kind of figured I'd rectify that today.
And it does feel good.

567
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,680
I'm gonna go ahead and put the
four ball in the corner pocket.

568
00:32:22,752 --> 00:32:23,980
Nice.

569
00:32:26,155 --> 00:32:29,386
I'm sorry, can I...
A little room for the shooter, please?

570
00:32:30,527 --> 00:32:33,496
It's hard to shoot with someone standing...
Thank you.

571
00:32:40,172 --> 00:32:41,469
Wow.

572
00:32:42,441 --> 00:32:47,105
Well, I guess he feels threatened that you
broke up with him and he's acting out.

573
00:32:47,981 --> 00:32:51,439
Okay, look, Brooke, men are like children.
You know? And they...

574
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:55,548
Sweetie, it's a figure of speech.
It's Brooke. And I love you so much.

575
00:32:55,623 --> 00:33:00,424
And you're my man and you know that.
You're amazing. I love you.

576
00:33:00,829 --> 00:33:04,094
Listen, and they're gonna test boundaries
to see what they can get away with.

577
00:33:04,167 --> 00:33:06,397
<i>I think there's three things
that Gary needs to know.</i>

578
00:33:06,469 --> 00:33:10,701
One, this type of behavior is not unnoticed.
Two, it's not acceptable.

579
00:33:10,775 --> 00:33:14,973
And three, you know, you're definitely
not gonna tolerate it. Right?

580
00:33:15,314 --> 00:33:16,440
Yes.

581
00:33:16,515 --> 00:33:19,746
<i>And Brooke, remember, we're always
owning our actions, right?</i>

582
00:33:19,818 --> 00:33:22,446
<i>And we're always
healthy with it, yes?</i>

583
00:33:23,523 --> 00:33:24,785
Yes.

584
00:33:25,158 --> 00:33:27,422
I don't wanna finish the game.
I got showings, okay?

585
00:33:27,494 --> 00:33:29,587
I gotta buy the cookie spray.
I gotta clean up the dog.

586
00:33:31,665 --> 00:33:34,361
And now I'm really leaving 'cause
I don't want to hear that. Okay?

587
00:33:34,436 --> 00:33:37,234
Thank you for the pool.
Thank you for the snacks.

588
00:33:45,749 --> 00:33:48,445
I'm going to get a cab.
I'll split it with you.

589
00:33:59,798 --> 00:34:03,063
What are you, 12?
Brooke, that is not healthy.

590
00:34:03,135 --> 00:34:05,228
I'm trying to make a point.
And what is that point?

591
00:34:05,305 --> 00:34:07,830
My point's your point.
Your three points.

592
00:34:07,907 --> 00:34:12,071
That it's not unnoticed,
that it was not acceptable,

593
00:34:12,213 --> 00:34:14,738
and that it would definitely
not be tolerated.

594
00:34:14,815 --> 00:34:16,578
Not exactly what I meant.

595
00:34:20,122 --> 00:34:21,589
Unbelievable.

596
00:34:24,827 --> 00:34:26,590
I knew it!
Hey, gang.

597
00:34:26,696 --> 00:34:29,722
Found my shirt on the floor.
Thanks for laying it out.

598
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:35,871
Gary, are you here for
couples bowling? Yeah.

599
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:39,905
Well, don't you think you and I
should discuss something first?

600
00:34:39,978 --> 00:34:42,344
Like what? How your
47 average is killing us?

601
00:34:42,415 --> 00:34:45,009
Okay. Great. No.

602
00:34:45,084 --> 00:34:49,350
Gary, this is couples bowling.
And since you and I are no longer a couple,

603
00:34:49,656 --> 00:34:51,351
because you have chosen

604
00:34:51,425 --> 00:34:55,327
not to participate constructively
in our relationship,

605
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:57,191
we're now singles.

606
00:34:57,265 --> 00:35:00,860
So, there's not room
for two singles on the team.

607
00:35:05,508 --> 00:35:07,408
Why do you look confused?

608
00:35:08,511 --> 00:35:12,777
I don't have any idea what's happening.
I've come to play on the team.

609
00:35:13,017 --> 00:35:14,609
Look, Gary, I just don't think
it's a good idea

610
00:35:14,685 --> 00:35:17,483
for you and I to be around each other
any more than we have to right now.

611
00:35:17,556 --> 00:35:19,683
I completely agree.
Maybe you should go play some pinball.

612
00:35:19,758 --> 00:35:22,784
No, I think you should leave.
Okay.

613
00:35:24,063 --> 00:35:29,023
Brooke, when a man makes a commitment
to a team, he honors that commitment.

614
00:35:29,837 --> 00:35:33,773
He doesn't let emotions or personal
issues get in the way of victory.

615
00:35:33,841 --> 00:35:36,275
And I've made a commitment
to this team.

616
00:35:36,344 --> 00:35:39,973
They don't want you here either, Gary.
Yeah. Sure, they don't.

617
00:35:40,048 --> 00:35:41,811
They don't.
They're my friends.

618
00:35:41,884 --> 00:35:45,581
But you're not a strong bowler.
That's not the point.

619
00:35:45,688 --> 00:35:49,055
You know what? Let's just...
Why don't we let them decide?

620
00:35:49,125 --> 00:35:52,754
Gary, don't. No. Don't involve them, okay?
That's unnecessary.

621
00:35:52,829 --> 00:35:54,592
What's wrong, Castro?
Castro?

622
00:35:54,665 --> 00:35:56,428
Well, Castro doesn't
let people vote as a team.

623
00:35:56,501 --> 00:35:58,628
Okay. Ask them.
Thank you.

624
00:35:58,803 --> 00:36:01,363
Okay, everyone.
Team vote here.

625
00:36:01,607 --> 00:36:04,940
By a show of hands, just put it
up when you make a decision,

626
00:36:05,311 --> 00:36:09,111
who here agrees with Brooke and thinks
I should leave the bowling team?

627
00:36:11,485 --> 00:36:12,713
Shocker.

628
00:36:31,008 --> 00:36:34,171
<i>Band of Brothers.
You should rent it sometime.</i>

629
00:36:36,748 --> 00:36:40,548
Good luck, everyone.
Riding Miss Gutter Ball to the finals.

630
00:36:42,187 --> 00:36:45,020
Hey, Gary.
Yeah.

631
00:36:47,026 --> 00:36:49,893
I'm gonna need your shirt back.
What?

632
00:36:50,497 --> 00:36:53,762
Well, we're gonna have to replace you,
and you know we get docked 10 pins

633
00:36:53,834 --> 00:36:56,701
if everyone's not in matching
Pin Shakers uniforms.

634
00:36:57,572 --> 00:36:59,665
My shirt says "Gary" on it.
Granted.

635
00:36:59,741 --> 00:37:03,040
But actually,
we know a guy named Gary.

636
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:07,410
And he's not as tall as you,
but he's a pretty good bowler.

637
00:37:16,694 --> 00:37:20,095
I'm gonna have to request that I
have my wrist guard back then.

638
00:37:21,232 --> 00:37:23,291
I'm sorry. That's mine.

639
00:37:28,107 --> 00:37:30,632
Just give me the goddamn wrist
guard, please. Thank you.

640
00:37:30,711 --> 00:37:32,679
I hope your wrist snaps.

641
00:37:38,753 --> 00:37:40,880
Wow. Okay? You see that?
You know what I mean?

642
00:37:40,955 --> 00:37:42,513
Yeah. That was awesome.

643
00:37:42,591 --> 00:37:45,253
You just had your ex-boyfriend, who
you wish you were still dating,

644
00:37:45,327 --> 00:37:47,352
voted off the bowling team.

645
00:37:47,463 --> 00:37:49,727
Well, I had to do that to get
him right where I want him.

646
00:37:49,799 --> 00:37:51,596
Where's that?
Shirtless in the parking lot?

647
00:37:51,668 --> 00:37:54,034
Addie, you're not getting this.

648
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:57,705
Gary loves this bowling team.
He's hurt right now.

649
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,402
He's feeling pretty bad.

650
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:02,173
He's gonna go out there
and he's gonna get drunk.

651
00:38:02,247 --> 00:38:04,841
He's gonna make
a complete fool of himself.

652
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:07,384
And he will be sitting there
feeling pretty lonely

653
00:38:07,453 --> 00:38:10,752
and pretty pathetic, and then
it's just gonna hit him.

654
00:38:11,524 --> 00:38:13,355
What's gonna hit him?

655
00:38:13,761 --> 00:38:15,786
That not only is he
out a girlfriend,

656
00:38:15,863 --> 00:38:18,730
but his life is just
falling apart piece by piece

657
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,665
and maybe that life
was pretty great.

658
00:38:20,735 --> 00:38:23,533
And maybe I was the glue that
was holding it all together.

659
00:38:23,605 --> 00:38:25,163
And if he wants that life back,

660
00:38:25,241 --> 00:38:27,971
he's gonna have no choice
but to change.

661
00:38:30,981 --> 00:38:33,108
How about this, huh?
I feel like we just found hell.

662
00:38:33,183 --> 00:38:35,174
When did you start coming
to knobby joints like this?

663
00:38:35,252 --> 00:38:37,311
I might be the greatest
you've ever seen, pal.

664
00:38:37,388 --> 00:38:39,822
I'm conquering new frontiers.
Hello, babe.

665
00:38:39,891 --> 00:38:42,382
Yeah, you've got to put up with
the bad music and the $15 drinks,

666
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:45,588
but this place is stacked with
top-shelf, young, dumb ass.

667
00:38:45,664 --> 00:38:47,962
All you gotta do is just separate
the weaker ones from the herd.

668
00:38:48,033 --> 00:38:49,227
Come on,
I'll get you into the VIP.

669
00:38:49,302 --> 00:38:51,065
Can I get a couple drinks from you?
Okay, L.G.

670
00:38:51,137 --> 00:38:53,264
Lupus, I got to be totally...
I got to be honest with you.

671
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:54,499
I'm not feeling it here.

672
00:38:54,574 --> 00:38:55,973
You're gonna like it in here.
You're gonna love it.

673
00:38:56,043 --> 00:38:58,136
I don't like it out here.
Look, listen to me, will you, please?

674
00:38:58,212 --> 00:38:59,338
How you doing, Buzz?

675
00:38:59,413 --> 00:39:01,608
While you were on the inside
locked up for the past two years,

676
00:39:01,683 --> 00:39:02,980
the game has changed.

677
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:09,615
Do you remember
when you were an outdoor cat

678
00:39:09,892 --> 00:39:12,156
and you used to have to hunt
and kill for your food?

679
00:39:12,228 --> 00:39:13,661
Well, you've become
an indoor cat.

680
00:39:13,731 --> 00:39:15,289
You've been getting your milk
brought to you

681
00:39:15,365 --> 00:39:16,423
in a silver bowl,
and guess what?

682
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,127
Now, you've been
tossed back outside

683
00:39:18,202 --> 00:39:21,399
and the alley has changed.
For example, your MTV generation,

684
00:39:21,473 --> 00:39:24,408
your technology, your text
message, your TiVo. You name it.

685
00:39:24,476 --> 00:39:26,671
People want their
information faster.

686
00:39:26,746 --> 00:39:29,738
People e-mail each other because they
want to exchange information, Gar.

687
00:39:29,815 --> 00:39:32,409
They don't want to connect,
they want results.

688
00:39:32,986 --> 00:39:35,181
Okay. You gotta get to
the message quicker.

689
00:39:35,255 --> 00:39:38,053
Now, I want you to watch.
It's real simple. Okay?

690
00:39:40,394 --> 00:39:41,725
How you doing, ladies?

691
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:42,888
Now, here's what I'd like
to do to you.

692
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:45,364
First, I'd like to
get you naked.

693
00:39:45,434 --> 00:39:47,061
And then I'm gonna take
some Saran Wrap

694
00:39:47,136 --> 00:39:48,865
and I'm gonna wrap you
up in it, head to toe.

695
00:39:48,937 --> 00:39:50,029
Then I'm gonna
cut out two holes.

696
00:39:50,106 --> 00:39:51,971
One for your mouth, so you
can breathe, obviously.

697
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:53,167
And the other one...
Asshole.

698
00:39:53,243 --> 00:39:54,904
It could be a gorgeous
evening for us, babe.

699
00:39:54,978 --> 00:39:56,240
The pink is gorgeous.
Jesus, God.

700
00:39:56,313 --> 00:39:58,247
Come here. Lupus, listen to me.
I want you to listen to me.

701
00:39:58,315 --> 00:39:59,612
There are our drinks.
You want your drink?

702
00:39:59,683 --> 00:40:01,810
No, I'm fine. Thank you.
The L.G. thanks you.

703
00:40:01,887 --> 00:40:04,913
Will you listen to me, please?
You're my brother and I love you very much,

704
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:07,481
and maybe you do get laid tonight,
but maybe you get arrested.

705
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,687
Arrested for what, babe?
Being awesome?

706
00:40:09,762 --> 00:40:13,391
Come on, babe, listen.
You want to tell your jokes, tell your jokes.

707
00:40:13,467 --> 00:40:17,267
But sooner or later you're gonna get
hungry and you're gonna wanna eat.

708
00:40:17,538 --> 00:40:21,030
And jokes might make you feel
better, but they don't get you fed.

709
00:40:23,144 --> 00:40:24,907
I'm gonna go take a lap.

710
00:40:35,826 --> 00:40:38,693
What are you doing?
I'm sketching.

711
00:40:39,163 --> 00:40:41,097
And where are you sketching?

712
00:40:41,499 --> 00:40:43,626
In the living room.
No, in my bedroom.

713
00:40:43,701 --> 00:40:45,293
And I didn't say anything
to you, Brooke,

714
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:47,668
when you so arrogantly claimed
the bed without asking me,

715
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:51,106
but you can't just waltz into my room
and turn it into a damn art fair.

716
00:40:51,177 --> 00:40:53,509
Gary, I've only taken up
a little bit of space, so...

717
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,548
I don't care if you only
took an inch.

718
00:40:55,615 --> 00:40:59,107
There might not be a door here,
but this is my domain. Okay?

719
00:40:59,186 --> 00:41:01,518
I don't go into your bedroom
and set up a goddamn sawhorse.

720
00:41:01,589 --> 00:41:04,285
Well, then what the hell is that
pool table doing in the dining room?

721
00:41:04,359 --> 00:41:06,827
Because that's a common area.
And that's where this belongs.

722
00:41:06,895 --> 00:41:08,362
Not in my room.
Hey, what are you doing?

723
00:41:08,431 --> 00:41:10,126
It belongs in another common area.
Gary.

724
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:12,667
People want to come home and they
want to relax in their room.

725
00:41:12,735 --> 00:41:15,499
Gary, it is 2:00
in the morning!

726
00:41:15,572 --> 00:41:18,132
Don't you drop my things.
I don't know what to tell you, kid.

727
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:19,232
This is how I am
when I'm single.

728
00:41:19,309 --> 00:41:21,368
My hours start to get
pretty strange.

729
00:41:21,446 --> 00:41:23,380
Might be time for you
to think about moving out.

730
00:41:23,448 --> 00:41:25,473
Why would I...
No, I'm not moving anywhere.

731
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:27,609
Gary, just please
turn the volume down.

732
00:41:27,686 --> 00:41:29,881
Yeah, but I don't tell you what
the hell to do in your room.

733
00:41:29,955 --> 00:41:31,479
You can doodle. You can dance.

734
00:41:31,557 --> 00:41:32,956
You can bake
a goddamn gingerbread house.

735
00:41:33,026 --> 00:41:34,050
I don't give a shit.

736
00:41:34,127 --> 00:41:36,891
But in my room, I want to
relax and watch my highlights

737
00:41:36,963 --> 00:41:39,557
in complete surround-sound
experience.

738
00:41:40,601 --> 00:41:43,092
What the hell are you doing?
You're not even gonna watch it!

739
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:44,762
Don't tell me what I am
or aren't not doing.

740
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,432
Oh, what you are not,
not doing?

741
00:41:46,508 --> 00:41:48,772
Go learn some English.
Oh, I'm sorry.

742
00:41:48,844 --> 00:41:52,336
I didn't have a grandfather on
the board of some fancy college.

743
00:41:52,415 --> 00:41:55,145
Key word being "was.
" Did he touch the Filipino exchange student?

744
00:41:55,218 --> 00:41:56,480
Did he not touch
the exchange student?

745
00:41:56,553 --> 00:41:58,111
I don't know, Brooke.
I wasn't there. Okay.

746
00:41:58,188 --> 00:41:59,485
No, don't start
with the family stuff.

747
00:41:59,556 --> 00:42:01,581
Like your family's so perfect?
Your brother's a pervert!

748
00:42:01,659 --> 00:42:04,127
Don't talk to me about the
sexual habits of family members.

749
00:42:04,195 --> 00:42:05,822
What about your sister?

750
00:42:06,765 --> 00:42:09,928
My sister's been through a lot.
Of dick.

751
00:42:11,003 --> 00:42:13,528
There are some problems, Gary, but
can we please just leave it...

752
00:42:13,606 --> 00:42:17,667
Problems? She slept with the entire
Arizona Cardinals offensive line.

753
00:42:17,844 --> 00:42:20,438
That's not problems.
That's she's the problem!

754
00:42:20,514 --> 00:42:23,483
She was on vacation!
She was on vacation.

755
00:42:23,818 --> 00:42:26,412
Don't even get me started,
by the way, on your brother.

756
00:42:26,487 --> 00:42:28,921
If I have to hear that guy
sing just one more time,

757
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:31,152
I'd hang myself
with wax dental floss.

758
00:42:31,226 --> 00:42:33,990
Could the guy just come out
of the closet, please?

759
00:42:34,064 --> 00:42:36,362
Richard is not gay.

760
00:42:38,601 --> 00:42:42,162
Okay, lassie, I want you to
listen to me and listen good.

761
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:43,501
I'm not saying
he won't get married.

762
00:42:43,574 --> 00:42:45,804
I'm not saying
he won't even have kids.

763
00:42:45,877 --> 00:42:47,174
But then one day
his wife will come home,

764
00:42:47,245 --> 00:42:49,304
and then she'll find him
with a guy named Majulio,

765
00:42:49,381 --> 00:42:52,077
wearing leather helmets and clubbing
each other to Yanni's greatest hits.

766
00:42:52,151 --> 00:42:53,743
Yeah. Right. Whatever.
You're an infant.

767
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,344
Yeah, I'm an infant.

768
00:42:55,421 --> 00:42:57,855
Go enjoy your room, Brooke,
'cause I'm gonna enjoy mine!

769
00:42:57,925 --> 00:42:59,119
Okay.
You know what?

770
00:42:59,193 --> 00:43:01,218
I might enjoy some
pay-per-view options tonight.

771
00:43:01,295 --> 00:43:02,557
It's gonna be a long one,
sweetheart,

772
00:43:02,629 --> 00:43:04,620
<i>and I got nothing to do maana
but sleep in.</i>

773
00:43:53,856 --> 00:43:57,053
<i>Boogie nights Ain't no doubt
we are here to party</i>

774
00:43:57,126 --> 00:43:58,388
What are you doing?

775
00:43:58,462 --> 00:44:00,259
<i>Boogie nights Come on now,
got to get it started</i>

776
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:01,695
Ricky, you and
the Get Along Gang leave

777
00:44:01,765 --> 00:44:03,699
or I'm gonna throw you out of
here personally, you understand?

778
00:44:03,768 --> 00:44:05,497
Actually, Gary,
this is Brooke's bedroom.

779
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:08,130
So, technically, you don't
have jurisdiction here,

780
00:44:08,206 --> 00:44:11,141
but I think it'd be really fun
if you sang with us.

781
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:12,905
Come on, Gary.
I think you'll like it.

782
00:44:12,978 --> 00:44:14,343
You got 10 seconds
to get out of here

783
00:44:14,413 --> 00:44:15,880
or I'm gonna break
your damn magic whistle.

784
00:44:15,949 --> 00:44:17,917
You understand
what I'm saying to you?

785
00:44:17,984 --> 00:44:20,111
Move this group
out of my house, now!

786
00:44:26,294 --> 00:44:29,491
Gary, you can't take a pitch
pipe out of a guy's hand

787
00:44:29,565 --> 00:44:32,193
when he's in the middle
of a very funky groove.

788
00:44:32,267 --> 00:44:33,928
You can get hurt
doing something like that.

789
00:44:34,002 --> 00:44:35,663
I'm tapping out,
I'm tapping out!

790
00:44:35,738 --> 00:44:37,365
Here we go. From the bridge.

791
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:42,207
<i>Party night Get on down with
the sound of the music</i>

792
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:44,975
<i>Boogie nights
Do it, do it</i>

793
00:44:54,727 --> 00:44:57,218
What kind of bullshit move
was that?

794
00:44:57,864 --> 00:45:00,697
I'm sorry. What? What happened?
Oh, don't be coy with me.

795
00:45:00,767 --> 00:45:04,726
You sent that animal over here to attack
me when I was hung over and weak.

796
00:45:06,007 --> 00:45:08,771
Oh, no. Look, all I know
is The Tone Rangers,

797
00:45:08,843 --> 00:45:10,242
they needed someplace
to rehearse,

798
00:45:10,311 --> 00:45:13,769
so I very clearly told
Richard, "Stay in my room,"

799
00:45:14,016 --> 00:45:17,543
which you explained to me was my
space to do with what I want.

800
00:45:17,888 --> 00:45:20,356
Is that how you want to play it?
'Cause I'll play it like that.

801
00:45:20,423 --> 00:45:21,549
I'll play it like
Lionel Richie.

802
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:24,253
All night long, lady.
Oh, yeah.

803
00:45:24,362 --> 00:45:26,159
I'll call some guys
from my neck of the woods.

804
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:27,356
And we're not talking, Brooke,

805
00:45:27,431 --> 00:45:29,695
about a couple of queens
who know a few grapples.

806
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:33,101
We're talking about Polacks that
don't have a goddamn future.

807
00:45:33,172 --> 00:45:34,434
Right.
That's right!

808
00:45:34,506 --> 00:45:36,371
We can make shit real
uncomfortable around here,

809
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:37,602
and that's what we're gonna do.

810
00:45:37,677 --> 00:45:39,076
Please. Come on.
You know what?

811
00:45:39,145 --> 00:45:42,205
You're just embarrassed because
Richard kicked your ass.

812
00:45:44,618 --> 00:45:47,849
Richard did not kick my ass.

813
00:45:47,989 --> 00:45:51,686
What Richard did was attack me
when I was half asleep.

814
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,660
Really?
Is that how you see it?

815
00:45:53,729 --> 00:45:56,960
There's a really big gap between
getting your ass kicked

816
00:45:57,033 --> 00:46:00,901
and having a dancing, singing
sprite fool you with trickery

817
00:46:00,971 --> 00:46:04,407
and then strike your throat before you
know that you're even in a fight.

818
00:46:04,474 --> 00:46:06,601
And I wouldn't expect someone
like you to understand that,

819
00:46:06,678 --> 00:46:10,705
because all you ever do is make
moves from up in your ivy tower.

820
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:14,783
Wow. You have officially
gone off the reservation.

821
00:46:14,853 --> 00:46:17,845
I'm an adult. I talk through shit.
He ran out of ideas.

822
00:46:18,592 --> 00:46:22,050
God. Listen, by the way, there's
messages on the voice mail

823
00:46:22,128 --> 00:46:24,392
regarding game night, which is
obviously not gonna happen,

824
00:46:24,465 --> 00:46:27,957
so you might want to call people
and tell them that it's canceled.

825
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:29,832
Why would I cancel game night?
Well, I mean...

826
00:46:29,905 --> 00:46:32,203
If it's our turn to host game, I'm
gonna host goddamn game night.

827
00:46:32,274 --> 00:46:33,969
You want to host game night?
I'm fine, Brooke.

828
00:46:34,042 --> 00:46:37,170
I don't have any strangeness
over what happened here today.

829
00:46:37,247 --> 00:46:38,236
Okay.

830
00:46:38,314 --> 00:46:40,942
If there's anyone that should
feel weird about seeing people,

831
00:46:41,017 --> 00:46:43,815
that's you, Tonya Harding. Me?
I'm gonna honor my commitments.

832
00:46:43,887 --> 00:46:45,252
Great.
Great.

833
00:46:45,322 --> 00:46:46,448
Fine.
Fine.

834
00:46:46,523 --> 00:46:48,354
Let's do that.
Let's do that.

835
00:46:48,493 --> 00:46:50,518
Let's honor the commitment.

836
00:46:53,566 --> 00:46:55,500
Hey, there's no food in there!
So?

837
00:46:55,568 --> 00:46:58,935
Well, people are gonna be here in an hour.
What are they supposed to eat?

838
00:46:59,005 --> 00:47:00,996
You're a big boy.
Figure it out.

839
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,883
Oh, great.
Well, that's what we got.

840
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:17,817
We have only tap water because,
you know, Gary didn't shop.

841
00:47:17,894 --> 00:47:21,830
And we don't have any ice either
'cause he didn't fill the trays.

842
00:47:22,132 --> 00:47:24,225
That's trash. It's your shot.
What is your name again?

843
00:47:24,302 --> 00:47:25,394
Diane.
Diane.

844
00:47:25,469 --> 00:47:26,561
Did you call?
I called the five.

845
00:47:26,637 --> 00:47:28,229
Well, yeah, but you didn't
call the second ball,

846
00:47:28,306 --> 00:47:29,398
so that's trash,
so it's your shot.

847
00:47:29,473 --> 00:47:31,407
You got to play
by the rules. It's your shot.

848
00:47:31,476 --> 00:47:32,500
Hi.
Hi.

849
00:47:32,644 --> 00:47:34,839
Andrew.
Oh, hi.

850
00:47:35,447 --> 00:47:37,415
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey, hey!

851
00:47:37,517 --> 00:47:40,111
These two Benedict Arnolds
aren't welcome in my condo.

852
00:47:40,186 --> 00:47:42,381
Who sent an invite to them?
I'm sorry.

853
00:47:42,456 --> 00:47:46,392
These are very loyal friends and
they are always welcome in my condo.

854
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:49,623
Oh, really? Why don't we take it to a vote
and see who has the numbers this time?

855
00:47:49,698 --> 00:47:51,029
All right.
Show of hands here.

856
00:47:51,099 --> 00:47:54,967
Who thinks that these two traitors should
leave and not be a part of game night?

857
00:47:55,037 --> 00:47:57,130
And maybe take their shirts
off when they leave.

858
00:47:57,206 --> 00:48:00,403
Raise your hand.
I know I feel that way. Who else?

859
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:02,569
Come on, Johnny O,
put your hand up, please.

860
00:48:02,646 --> 00:48:05,410
Come on. Thank you.
You, Miss? New girl.

861
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:08,613
Who's the girl? What's her name?
What's her name?

862
00:48:08,686 --> 00:48:11,348
The girl you're with.
What's her name? Her name's Diane.

863
00:48:11,422 --> 00:48:14,414
Oh, I'm sorry. You might want
to go ahead and touch some sky.

864
00:48:14,493 --> 00:48:17,360
Thank you. Come on, Riggleman, please?
What are you doing?

865
00:48:17,429 --> 00:48:19,659
No. We need the eight to count
towards a running tally.

866
00:48:19,733 --> 00:48:20,825
You know that. Come on.

867
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,959
Show her whose side that you're on.
Put your hand in the air.

868
00:48:23,036 --> 00:48:25,937
You know whose side I'm on.
You know we need eight, though. Come on.

869
00:48:26,006 --> 00:48:27,735
Put your hand down.

870
00:48:32,514 --> 00:48:33,845
Please don't touch my Ruffles.

871
00:48:33,915 --> 00:48:35,177
Put that one back.
Those are my Ruffles.

872
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:36,615
Don't eat them, please.
Thank you.

873
00:48:36,686 --> 00:48:38,176
Oh, Gary.
They're mine.

874
00:48:38,254 --> 00:48:39,482
Come on.
Here we go. All right.

875
00:48:39,555 --> 00:48:42,319
Eyes front. Ready? Hold on.
Get the timer going, please.

876
00:48:42,392 --> 00:48:44,485
Ready?
Now I gotta do it. Go.

877
00:48:44,561 --> 00:48:46,153
Okay.
It's a brick.

878
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:48,027
Square. Square.
Box. Box.

879
00:48:48,098 --> 00:48:50,589
Corner. Corner.
A dot in the corner.

880
00:48:50,668 --> 00:48:52,226
A house.
Home plate!

881
00:48:52,303 --> 00:48:55,568
Football! Baseball! Sports. A house.
A triangle. It's algebra.

882
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,575
Okay, it's a house.
It's a house.

883
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:59,042
It's a house.
Two words.

884
00:48:59,111 --> 00:49:00,669
Banana?
Chimney, chimney, chimney!

885
00:49:00,747 --> 00:49:03,477
A fruit. House. Fruit.

886
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:05,074
Oh, restaurant. Or...

887
00:49:05,152 --> 00:49:06,517
No, chimney, chimney.
Smoke...

888
00:49:06,586 --> 00:49:08,679
Oh, a house call.
House call!

889
00:49:08,756 --> 00:49:10,155
Oh! House call!

890
00:49:10,224 --> 00:49:11,987
Yeah, well, I thought
it was a house call.

891
00:49:12,059 --> 00:49:14,050
Like a hotel, then it hit
me it was a house. Yeah!

892
00:49:14,129 --> 00:49:16,097
You're terrific.
Absolutely terrific.

893
00:49:16,165 --> 00:49:17,223
All right, beat that.

894
00:49:17,299 --> 00:49:18,493
Okay, guys, listen.
The next one wins, okay?

895
00:49:18,567 --> 00:49:20,194
So let's stay focused.
Let's stay calm.

896
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:22,295
We can do this. High fives.
Let's go. Come on. Let's go.

897
00:49:22,372 --> 00:49:24,567
Let's get a mind-meld.
Let's try and get a mind-meld, okay?

898
00:49:24,641 --> 00:49:26,074
Here we go. Let's go.
Mind-meld. I heard you!

899
00:49:26,143 --> 00:49:27,610
Don't over-think it.
Mind meld. Ready?

900
00:49:27,678 --> 00:49:29,441
I heard you!
Well, just keep it simple.

901
00:49:29,513 --> 00:49:30,605
Shush.

902
00:49:30,681 --> 00:49:33,149
Ready? Wait. Go! Here we go!
We're mind-melding.

903
00:49:33,218 --> 00:49:34,879
Draw faster.
It doesn't have to be beautiful,

904
00:49:34,953 --> 00:49:36,318
just has to be something we can get.
Shoe, shoe...

905
00:49:36,388 --> 00:49:38,117
Shoe! Shoe, shoe, shoe.

906
00:49:38,491 --> 00:49:40,823
Shoeless Joe Jackson. Draw something different.
No one's getting it.

907
00:49:40,893 --> 00:49:42,554
Shoe. What, is that a smaller shoe?
Baby shoe.

908
00:49:42,628 --> 00:49:44,653
Smaller shoe. Baby shoes.
Shoes.

909
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:46,323
Baby shoes.
Smaller shoe. Gumshoe.

910
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,560
Smaller shoes.
Gumshoe? Gumshoe?

911
00:49:47,634 --> 00:49:50,159
Running Olympics.
Inside the shoe.

912
00:49:50,839 --> 00:49:53,034
Inside a shoe. A bubble...
Lining.

913
00:49:53,107 --> 00:49:55,302
Stop pointing at the shoe. We're not...
No one's guessing shoe.

914
00:49:55,377 --> 00:49:56,935
Stop pointing at the shoe
and draw something different.

915
00:49:57,012 --> 00:49:58,036
Draw something different.
You...

916
00:49:58,113 --> 00:50:00,604
Goddamn it!
No one's guessing shoe!

917
00:50:00,683 --> 00:50:03,811
You drew a big shoe, then a
small shoe, and no one got it.

918
00:50:03,887 --> 00:50:07,152
You gotta draw something different.
Everyone said "shoe" seven times.

919
00:50:07,224 --> 00:50:08,987
It's a sock, asshole.

920
00:50:10,194 --> 00:50:11,388
You call yourself an artist?
Yes!

921
00:50:11,462 --> 00:50:14,090
A three-year-old with a box of crayons
could do a better job than this.

922
00:50:14,166 --> 00:50:16,896
I'm sorry, I don't have the great talent
of standing on top of a big red bus

923
00:50:16,969 --> 00:50:19,164
and pointing out architecture
that other great men have built!

924
00:50:19,238 --> 00:50:20,466
I'm the one who should
be sorry, Brooke.

925
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:22,269
I shouldn't sit here and
pick on your art. No.

926
00:50:22,342 --> 00:50:24,435
Because you got the nuts
part down, Picasso.

927
00:50:24,511 --> 00:50:26,103
All you have to do is cut
off your frigging ear.

928
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:27,340
That's Van Gogh, you idiot!

929
00:50:27,414 --> 00:50:29,348
And your insults are much more
effective when they're accurate.

930
00:50:29,416 --> 00:50:30,542
Don't talk to me about
being goddamn accurate!

931
00:50:30,618 --> 00:50:31,744
I can talk to you
about anything that I want.

932
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,082
'Cause you couldn't even
draw a sock.

933
00:50:33,154 --> 00:50:34,246
You don't do anything right!
You're a lazy...

934
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:35,550
Everyone said,
"Shoe, shoe, shoe!"

935
00:50:36,224 --> 00:50:40,160
At first, I figured that the split
was just something temporary,

936
00:50:40,229 --> 00:50:43,323
something that you two
would work out and get past,

937
00:50:43,399 --> 00:50:44,991
but after tonight
I think it's pretty clear

938
00:50:45,068 --> 00:50:48,128
that you two genuinely do not
want to get back together.

939
00:50:48,238 --> 00:50:50,103
There's not a shot in hell.
Gary.

940
00:50:50,174 --> 00:50:51,835
I'm just...
I got you.

941
00:50:52,477 --> 00:50:55,173
As your friend
and as your realtor,

942
00:50:55,246 --> 00:50:56,406
I'm not gonna
leave here tonight

943
00:50:56,482 --> 00:50:58,109
until we decide
what to do about this condo,

944
00:50:58,183 --> 00:51:02,517
because this living situation
is obviously not working out.

945
00:51:05,759 --> 00:51:06,919
Gary?

946
00:51:11,165 --> 00:51:13,963
Well, the only logical thing
that I can think of

947
00:51:14,536 --> 00:51:17,505
is for her to move out
of the condo,

948
00:51:17,573 --> 00:51:21,339
and then to pay me some sort of
a penalty as compensation for

949
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,641
the labor that I did all around the condo.
What? What?

950
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:26,773
What? Pay you compensation
for your labor?

951
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:29,984
We fixed this place up together.
Are you nuts?

952
00:51:30,054 --> 00:51:31,715
Stop calling me nuts, I swear to God.
I fixed the...

953
00:51:31,789 --> 00:51:32,915
You went around with a sponge,

954
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:34,481
and you went in the bathroom
and you dotted foofy shit.

955
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,117
That's what you're saying that I did?
There's no...

956
00:51:36,194 --> 00:51:37,718
That was...
That's called aesthetics.

957
00:51:37,796 --> 00:51:39,821
It warmed this place up
so it didn't look like

958
00:51:39,899 --> 00:51:42,129
an army barracks,
which it was about to.

959
00:51:42,201 --> 00:51:44,135
I'll tell you what it's called
in his language, depreciated.

960
00:51:44,203 --> 00:51:46,194
That's what it's called.
You don't even know what that means.

961
00:51:46,273 --> 00:51:48,639
Unless the next buyer happens to have
your same Zulu-voodoo-land taste.

962
00:51:48,709 --> 00:51:50,006
All right.
Let me tell you something else.

963
00:51:50,077 --> 00:51:52,477
It's gonna cost money to cover
up the holes in the wall.

964
00:51:52,547 --> 00:51:55,948
The holes that you drilled in the wall there
to hang up whatever that thing is called.

965
00:51:56,017 --> 00:51:57,075
Oh, please. Gary.

966
00:51:57,152 --> 00:51:58,141
You're gonna have
to cost money to fix that.

967
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:00,780
What I did, Brooke, has
concrete value to the condo.

968
00:52:00,856 --> 00:52:02,687
I added concrete...
Well, let's just go on record.

969
00:52:02,759 --> 00:52:05,592
We're dealing with facts here.
I did the tiling in the bathroom.

970
00:52:05,662 --> 00:52:07,391
Have you seen...
I did the new track lighting.

971
00:52:07,464 --> 00:52:09,295
That tile is the shittiest tile job.
I did the plumbing!

972
00:52:09,367 --> 00:52:10,800
The plumbing!
That's realty terms.

973
00:52:10,868 --> 00:52:12,631
Okay. Let's talk about your plumbing.
This is his plumbing.

974
00:52:12,703 --> 00:52:13,863
We have two temperatures
in our bathroom.

975
00:52:13,938 --> 00:52:16,668
We get either scalding hot
or we get frostbite.

976
00:52:16,742 --> 00:52:18,232
That's it. That's all we get.
It's my problem

977
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:19,675
that she doesn't know how
to pace a shower?

978
00:52:19,745 --> 00:52:20,734
Now all of a sudden
that's my fault.

979
00:52:20,813 --> 00:52:21,871
I get a minute
to take a shower.

980
00:52:21,948 --> 00:52:23,176
One minute?
One minute of warmth?

981
00:52:23,249 --> 00:52:25,376
Oh, Jesus. One minute.
That's it. That's correct.

982
00:52:25,451 --> 00:52:28,181
Thank God you're not in charge of keeping
all the clocks in Chicago on time.

983
00:52:28,255 --> 00:52:30,723
This is basic logic. You are out of your mind.
You have lost it.

984
00:52:30,791 --> 00:52:32,588
Let me explain this to you
in plain chapter and verse.

985
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:36,721
Cheese and rice, you guys are gonna
kill each other. Now, let's just...

986
00:52:36,798 --> 00:52:39,323
Realistically speaking,
neither one of you

987
00:52:39,402 --> 00:52:41,529
can afford this mortgage
on your own, okay?

988
00:52:41,604 --> 00:52:45,233
And that's a shame, because this building
will continue to increase in value.

989
00:52:45,308 --> 00:52:47,572
I get nothing but phone
calls about it, all right?

990
00:52:47,644 --> 00:52:49,236
Waiting for a unit to open up.

991
00:52:49,312 --> 00:52:53,009
So, as your realtor, the last
thing I would suggest is selling.

992
00:52:53,084 --> 00:52:56,611
But as your friend, I just, I
don't see any other solution.

993
00:52:56,988 --> 00:52:58,819
You take your halves,
you go your separate ways,

994
00:52:58,891 --> 00:53:00,882
and you get on with your lives.

995
00:53:02,695 --> 00:53:07,394
I know that selling is not the easiest
thing, but I do think that it's the best.

996
00:53:08,368 --> 00:53:11,599
And to be honest,
this is a situation

997
00:53:11,672 --> 00:53:14,937
where I would just as soon
not take a commission.

998
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,677
That's great. Thank you.
That's great. Thank you for that.

999
00:53:21,751 --> 00:53:23,548
I wish I didn't have to,
you know,

1000
00:53:23,619 --> 00:53:26,486
but company policy says
I cannot waive that.

1001
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:29,417
But I was just...
You know, I'm saying in theory, you know.

1002
00:53:29,493 --> 00:53:33,862
In this situation, 'cause we're
friends, I wish I could waive it.

1003
00:53:33,965 --> 00:53:35,364
No can do, though.

1004
00:53:35,667 --> 00:53:39,694
As soon as you can, I would love to
get a set of keys from you guys.

1005
00:53:39,772 --> 00:53:42,673
You just drop them off.
Okay. Great. There they are.

1006
00:53:42,742 --> 00:53:44,869
I'll be bringing by
people all week.

1007
00:53:44,944 --> 00:53:49,005
You won't even know I'm here.
The good news is, should move quickly.

1008
00:53:49,449 --> 00:53:50,643
All right.

1009
00:53:51,753 --> 00:53:53,744
Okay to leave you two
alone now?

1010
00:53:54,021 --> 00:53:57,479
Got to get back to Jen.
Very excited about the win tonight.

1011
00:53:58,660 --> 00:53:59,786
Okay.

1012
00:54:15,012 --> 00:54:17,037
Addie, if the condo sells, I
think I'm gonna lose him.

1013
00:54:17,115 --> 00:54:18,810
<i>Yeah, but game night
was so light and fun,</i>

1014
00:54:18,884 --> 00:54:20,943
<i>I'm really surprised
to be hearing this.</i>

1015
00:54:21,019 --> 00:54:23,317
Okay. You know what?
That's not constructive. Really.

1016
00:54:23,389 --> 00:54:25,755
I just... Yeah, I need
a new plan, Addie. I don't...

1017
00:54:28,862 --> 00:54:30,159
I'm just kidding. It's me.

1018
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:32,391
I'm gonna have to
call you back.

1019
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:36,763
Whenever one of my friends is down,
we all go on, like, happy patrol.

1020
00:54:36,838 --> 00:54:39,068
I was actually having
a very serious conversation.

1021
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:40,471
Christopher, do not sing.

1022
00:54:40,543 --> 00:54:44,138
<i>If you're happy and you
know it Clap your hands</i>

1023
00:54:45,281 --> 00:54:48,614
<i>If you're happy and you
know it Clap your hands</i>

1024
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:51,449
<i>If you're happy and you know it
You're going to smile to...</i>

1025
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:56,720
Pack up your shit and go home.

1026
00:54:58,831 --> 00:55:00,321
Okay. You know what?
This is not his fault.

1027
00:55:00,399 --> 00:55:03,266
He was just really trying
to cheer me up and it...

1028
00:55:08,374 --> 00:55:11,901
Did I or did I not give you
the day off to be sad?

1029
00:55:11,979 --> 00:55:14,539
Yes. But I...
Well, today's not that day,

1030
00:55:14,648 --> 00:55:17,742
and unfortunately for you,
I can't afford to look weak.

1031
00:55:17,819 --> 00:55:18,945
No, please.

1032
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:22,920
You have warned me so many times
and you have yet to fire me.

1033
00:55:23,125 --> 00:55:26,959
I think you and I both know that
to find and train somebody new,

1034
00:55:27,029 --> 00:55:29,793
it's gonna cost you time,
and it's gonna cost you money,

1035
00:55:29,867 --> 00:55:32,995
and I don't think you want
to spend either one of those.

1036
00:55:33,971 --> 00:55:37,168
Now, look, I'm just gonna
take a wild guess here,

1037
00:55:37,242 --> 00:55:40,507
but you don't become
Marilyn Dean

1038
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,607
without knowing
how to handle men.

1039
00:55:44,183 --> 00:55:47,914
Okay? Now, just listen
to my problem,

1040
00:55:48,488 --> 00:55:51,651
tell me how to fix it, and then
we'll all go back to work.

1041
00:55:54,095 --> 00:55:57,587
Okay. What is this problem
so severe

1042
00:55:58,165 --> 00:56:02,295
that has caused you to blaspheme
in the synagogue of Marilyn Dean?

1043
00:56:03,338 --> 00:56:07,001
Well, it's Gary.
I broke up with him

1044
00:56:07,911 --> 00:56:12,507
in hopes that losing me would
make him want to change,

1045
00:56:12,583 --> 00:56:14,642
and that's, you know...

1046
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:19,055
And I've just ended up pushing him,
you know, farther and farther away.

1047
00:56:20,492 --> 00:56:23,552
That's it?
Yeah.

1048
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:29,367
Honey, this is not surrealism or
cubism, it's paint-by-numbers.

1049
00:56:31,338 --> 00:56:35,274
Go see Mischa,
my personal waxer at the spa.

1050
00:56:35,476 --> 00:56:38,001
Ask her for the Telly Savalas.

1051
00:56:39,314 --> 00:56:41,145
The Telly Savalas.

1052
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:43,547
Compliments of M. Dean.

1053
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:48,484
Then go show Gary
your immaculate canvas

1054
00:56:48,558 --> 00:56:52,392
and let him see another man
eager to paint it. Got it?

1055
00:56:53,831 --> 00:56:55,093
Got it?
Uh-huh.

1056
00:57:00,772 --> 00:57:01,898
Ow!

1057
00:57:14,021 --> 00:57:15,682
Who loves you, baby?

1058
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:20,216
<i>Wow, impressive.
Three sharp hands landed.</i>

1059
00:57:20,295 --> 00:57:23,458
<i>What an amazing display
of punching technique.</i>

1060
00:57:23,531 --> 00:57:26,193
<i>The crowd jumps.
That punch rocked him.</i>

1061
00:57:26,268 --> 00:57:28,736
<i>They sense he's on the verge
of hitting the canvas.</i>

1062
00:57:28,804 --> 00:57:31,830
<i>The roaring for anticipation
of a knockout.</i>

1063
00:57:31,908 --> 00:57:34,604
<i>We are witnessing
a great fight.</i>

1064
00:57:34,678 --> 00:57:38,079
<i>He's displaying incredible
rhythm with his hands.</i>

1065
00:57:38,716 --> 00:57:43,517
<i>Bulldog terrorizing
his opponent. Down he goes!</i>

1066
00:57:43,589 --> 00:57:46,114
<i>Hard punch slams him
to the canvas.</i>

1067
00:57:52,465 --> 00:57:55,593
<i>One, two, three,</i>

1068
00:57:55,669 --> 00:58:00,333
<i>four, five, six, seven, eight,</i>

1069
00:58:00,942 --> 00:58:03,877
<i>nine, ten. It's over.</i>

1070
00:58:16,527 --> 00:58:19,428
Is... Did... Is Brooke here?

1071
00:58:20,865 --> 00:58:22,093
I don't know.

1072
00:58:31,344 --> 00:58:33,744
Brooke?
I'll be right there.

1073
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:46,152
<i>Cool, baby, cool.</i>

1074
00:58:54,705 --> 00:58:57,139
So, how do you and Brooke
know each other?

1075
00:58:57,208 --> 00:59:00,371
Well, how don't we know each
other, you know what I mean?

1076
00:59:01,379 --> 00:59:05,076
Hi, Paul.
Oh, hey. Wow, you look great.

1077
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:06,139
Thank you.

1078
00:59:06,218 --> 00:59:09,619
Are you ready to go?
Yeah. All set.

1079
00:59:10,223 --> 00:59:13,852
So, it was great meeting you.
Apple martinis.

1080
00:59:13,927 --> 00:59:15,986
All right, come on.
That normally does the trick.

1081
00:59:16,063 --> 00:59:18,327
Just ignore him. But just two.
Three, she'll get sloppy.

1082
00:59:18,398 --> 00:59:19,592
You'll become a babysitter.

1083
00:59:19,667 --> 00:59:22,795
Oh, and fantasy role playing.
She's got a real thing for lifeguards.

1084
00:59:22,871 --> 00:59:25,931
Put some zinc oxide on your
nose and she'll lose her mind.

1085
00:59:26,008 --> 00:59:27,100
It'll all be over with.

1086
00:59:30,479 --> 00:59:32,606
<i>Y'all want me
to stop running?</i>

1087
01:00:03,318 --> 01:00:05,411
I mean, the most challenging
part of what I do

1088
01:00:05,487 --> 01:00:08,581
is between February
and April 15th.

1089
01:00:08,658 --> 01:00:12,025
That's what we in the biz
like to call crunch time.

1090
01:00:13,262 --> 01:00:14,854
That sounds fascinating.

1091
01:00:14,932 --> 01:00:16,524
Good evening.
Hi.

1092
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:18,329
Can I start you two off
with something to drink?

1093
01:00:18,402 --> 01:00:22,668
Yeah, you know, we're gonna start with
a couple of apple martinis, please.

1094
01:00:23,241 --> 01:00:27,268
No, you know what? I'm gonna...
I'm just gonna start with a water.

1095
01:00:27,346 --> 01:00:29,746
Well, you can just bring those, just in case.
What was I saying?

1096
01:00:29,815 --> 01:00:31,009
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1097
01:00:31,083 --> 01:00:34,075
So, you know, it's not like
it's all work and no play.

1098
01:00:34,454 --> 01:00:37,890
You know, I mean, after April
15th, that's what we in the biz

1099
01:00:37,959 --> 01:00:40,120
like to call party time.

1100
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:42,521
Excuse me.

1101
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:47,194
Oh, I have to get this.
I'm so sorry.

1102
01:00:47,269 --> 01:00:48,327
Hello.

1103
01:00:48,403 --> 01:00:50,837
<i>Okay, is this when I'm
supposed to call? What?</i>

1104
01:00:50,907 --> 01:00:53,375
What do you mean? What?
Where? What happened?

1105
01:00:53,443 --> 01:00:57,004
<i>Okay, that's great.
Wait. What? Oh, all right.</i>

1106
01:00:57,081 --> 01:00:59,379
Listen, where... Just don't move.
Where are you?

1107
01:00:59,450 --> 01:01:01,475
<i>I'm sitting in my kitchen.
Sitting? Okay.</i>

1108
01:01:01,552 --> 01:01:03,520
Don't move.

1109
01:01:03,588 --> 01:01:07,524
Don't... I'm gonna be right there, honey.
I'm gonna be right there, okay?

1110
01:01:07,592 --> 01:01:09,389
Is everything okay?
Oh, my gosh.

1111
01:01:09,462 --> 01:01:10,929
That was my best friend.

1112
01:01:10,997 --> 01:01:14,831
She just had an accident and she...
She has this knee thing

1113
01:01:14,901 --> 01:01:17,870
and she's just very fragile,
and I have to go. What?

1114
01:01:18,005 --> 01:01:20,405
I can give you a ride.
No. No. That's okay.

1115
01:01:20,475 --> 01:01:23,205
I'm gonna grab a cab, so...
I'm so sorry.

1116
01:01:23,278 --> 01:01:24,802
I like your dress.

1117
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:29,607
I think he's fascinating.
He's obviously read a lot of books.

1118
01:01:29,685 --> 01:01:31,312
Yeah. Yeah, I bet he has.

1119
01:01:31,387 --> 01:01:34,686
He reads a lot of books because
nobody wants to talk to him.

1120
01:01:34,991 --> 01:01:38,449
He's a friend of Andrew's
who's always been polite.

1121
01:01:38,529 --> 01:01:40,929
It's the best I could do
on such short notice, okay?

1122
01:01:40,998 --> 01:01:43,057
Well, you know what?
Polite is not gonna do it.

1123
01:01:43,134 --> 01:01:47,127
We've got to find somebody who is
really gonna make Gary jealous.

1124
01:01:48,307 --> 01:01:49,365
Can I just say something?

1125
01:01:49,441 --> 01:01:50,840
You sound a little jealous,
Gary.

1126
01:01:50,910 --> 01:01:52,810
Why would I be jealous of some
guy with computer skills?

1127
01:01:52,879 --> 01:01:56,440
Let's say he doesn't have computer skills,
but he's got a big old elephant hog on him?

1128
01:01:56,517 --> 01:01:58,246
Would that bother you or
would you be okay with that?

1129
01:01:58,319 --> 01:01:59,718
Not nearly as much as the way
that your mind works.

1130
01:01:59,787 --> 01:02:01,084
My mind works great.

1131
01:02:01,155 --> 01:02:04,420
So, what's this bullshit I hear
about you selling the condo?

1132
01:02:04,592 --> 01:02:06,583
Selling that condo
is ludicrous.

1133
01:02:06,695 --> 01:02:08,219
I was waiting for
when I was gonna get

1134
01:02:08,296 --> 01:02:10,890
the how-Gary-always-
screws-his-life-up speech again.

1135
01:02:10,966 --> 01:02:12,593
This must be the right time.
Look, you tell me,

1136
01:02:12,668 --> 01:02:14,727
you just tell me, tell me.
Is it happening now? Yeah. Okay.

1137
01:02:14,805 --> 01:02:17,399
Tell me how losing that asset

1138
01:02:17,474 --> 01:02:20,568
is gonna get us on the river?

1139
01:02:20,645 --> 01:02:24,342
Go ahead, just tell me. Tell me.
Somebody tell me. What is this?

1140
01:02:24,482 --> 01:02:27,815
What is this? What is it? What is it?
Hey! Don't patronize me.

1141
01:02:27,886 --> 01:02:29,877
Helicopters.
Helicopters. Exactly!

1142
01:02:29,955 --> 01:02:31,923
How does losing the asset
give us helicopters?

1143
01:02:31,990 --> 01:02:35,721
Dennis, I'm being totally serious with you.
I don't need this shit right now.

1144
01:02:35,795 --> 01:02:37,888
Hey, you want to cry,
cry to Mom.

1145
01:02:38,665 --> 01:02:40,599
Nobody's crying.
I'm not crying.

1146
01:02:40,668 --> 01:02:43,432
I just don't feel like hearing it.
There's no feelings here.

1147
01:02:43,504 --> 01:02:47,201
This is about money and business.
Fine, you broke up.

1148
01:02:50,112 --> 01:02:51,807
You broke up. Fine.

1149
01:02:53,383 --> 01:02:54,873
You know, sad.

1150
01:02:56,085 --> 01:03:00,579
Sad is, instead of putting $1,000
into your mortgage every month,

1151
01:03:00,657 --> 01:03:03,626
you waste it on rent.
That's what sad is.

1152
01:03:03,895 --> 01:03:08,525
Oh, you're broke up.
You're confused, brokenhearted.

1153
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:11,928
Heartbreak is not
having that money

1154
01:03:12,004 --> 01:03:15,701
as part of your net worth
and then not saving the money,

1155
01:03:16,009 --> 01:03:18,842
so that after taxes
you can invest!

1156
01:03:19,413 --> 01:03:24,112
You know, you're confused.

1157
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:29,481
Are you finished?
Look, I need the damn tour logs.

1158
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:32,549
Yeah.

1159
01:03:33,363 --> 01:03:35,957
Well, I really, really
appreciate the heart to heart.

1160
01:03:36,032 --> 01:03:38,398
It was a great talk, Dennis.
Thank you.

1161
01:03:38,568 --> 01:03:41,628
Oh, well, you're behind three months.
You're still behind three months.

1162
01:03:41,705 --> 01:03:44,799
And those logs are imperative to
insuring that our books are straight!

1163
01:03:44,875 --> 01:03:47,503
I'll tell you what those logs are.
Those logs are bullshit is what they are!

1164
01:03:47,579 --> 01:03:49,479
You got the receipts.
Tally the goddamn things yourself!

1165
01:03:49,548 --> 01:03:50,674
I do, I do!

1166
01:03:50,749 --> 01:03:54,185
And I don't appreciate it, because
it cuts into my time with my family.

1167
01:03:54,253 --> 01:03:57,222
I could be spending that time with my
family instead of doing your books.

1168
01:03:57,290 --> 01:03:59,485
I already do the taxes.
I do the billing.

1169
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:02,791
I do the hiring, the firing.
I do the maintenance.

1170
01:04:02,863 --> 01:04:05,889
Come on, what do you do?
What is it that you do?

1171
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:08,765
You do the tours!
I am the talent, Dennis!

1172
01:04:09,204 --> 01:04:11,695
They sign up a month
in advance to see me.

1173
01:04:11,841 --> 01:04:16,141
They'll wait in line for the
next bus to see me! All right?

1174
01:04:17,547 --> 01:04:22,041
So don't drain me with all this
bullshit about the goddamn tour logs!

1175
01:04:36,035 --> 01:04:38,026
<i>How big's your TV?
Oh, shut up!</i>

1176
01:04:38,104 --> 01:04:40,470
How big's your TV, 'cause I wanna
know if you can see what's happening.

1177
01:04:40,541 --> 01:04:42,236
<i>Oh, wow.
You beat a 12-year-old.</i>

1178
01:04:42,309 --> 01:04:45,142
I don't care if you're 12 years old.
You have more time in the day to play.

1179
01:04:45,212 --> 01:04:46,543
I live in the real world,
my man,

1180
01:04:46,615 --> 01:04:49,448
with bills
and responsibilities.

1181
01:04:49,651 --> 01:04:51,118
That's right.

1182
01:04:51,186 --> 01:04:54,644
You can't have a handle called Mad Dog
Killer if you complain every time...

1183
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:56,783
Brooke?
Hi, Mike.

1184
01:04:56,859 --> 01:04:58,656
Hi.
Come on in.

1185
01:04:58,729 --> 01:04:59,923
<i>Hold on, Mom. I'm coming.</i>

1186
01:04:59,997 --> 01:05:00,986
Is your mom
in the room with you?

1187
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:03,294
'Cause I hope she can't see
what's happening.

1188
01:05:03,367 --> 01:05:04,959
I hope she can't see
what's happening.

1189
01:05:05,036 --> 01:05:07,971
I'm gonna be just a few more seconds.
So, just sit down and relax.

1190
01:05:08,039 --> 01:05:09,904
Oh, yeah, no problem.

1191
01:05:09,974 --> 01:05:12,272
I'm sorry?
Yeah, why'd you do that?

1192
01:05:12,344 --> 01:05:16,144
You take the fun out of beating you,
because you have an excuse to lose.

1193
01:05:16,215 --> 01:05:17,307
<i>Get a life, dude.</i>

1194
01:05:17,384 --> 01:05:19,852
Do you think it's possible that
your mom won't love you anymore

1195
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,649
if she sees how bad
you're losing in the game.

1196
01:05:21,721 --> 01:05:22,813
<i>Shut up!</i>

1197
01:05:48,019 --> 01:05:49,008
Okay.

1198
01:05:50,422 --> 01:05:51,616
All right.

1199
01:05:53,492 --> 01:05:55,619
That's great. You're gonna
stay man-to-man with me.

1200
01:05:55,695 --> 01:05:57,060
What happens
when I make a play?

1201
01:05:57,129 --> 01:05:59,962
Making plays, making plays!
Making plays!

1202
01:06:00,033 --> 01:06:02,365
Well, you know, that's how my people
like to handle their business.

1203
01:06:02,436 --> 01:06:04,927
While your guys are out partying,
mine are running routes.

1204
01:06:05,006 --> 01:06:06,405
Try to make a difference.

1205
01:06:06,474 --> 01:06:08,908
Mike? I'm ready to go.

1206
01:06:10,812 --> 01:06:12,302
Oh, hey,

1207
01:06:13,916 --> 01:06:17,784
do you mind if we finish the game?
We got a real nail-biter going here.

1208
01:06:22,525 --> 01:06:25,221
Yeah, sure. Of course. Great.

1209
01:06:26,497 --> 01:06:28,124
Awesome, all right?

1210
01:06:32,604 --> 01:06:34,731
Touchdown.
Oh, God, is that pretty.

1211
01:06:34,973 --> 01:06:38,170
God, is that pretty.
Yeah, I'm a gentleman.

1212
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:41,710
I like to be humble. I'm old school.
I don't like to talk a lot.

1213
01:06:41,782 --> 01:06:45,183
But at the same time,
am I talented?

1214
01:06:45,619 --> 01:06:47,644
Tell me how you felt about
what just happened there.

1215
01:06:47,722 --> 01:06:49,690
That's him going deep.
That's him going...

1216
01:06:49,758 --> 01:06:52,522
Work ethic. Work ethic.

1217
01:06:54,497 --> 01:06:56,431
I could play this game forever.

1218
01:06:56,499 --> 01:06:58,626
Oh, I could, too. I love it, yeah.
I love it, don't you?

1219
01:06:58,701 --> 01:07:00,066
I mean, it's the kind of thing
where literally

1220
01:07:00,137 --> 01:07:02,867
I play the game and it's like,
four hours go by.

1221
01:07:04,441 --> 01:07:07,638
Fate has me highly skilled
and loaded with talent.

1222
01:07:08,012 --> 01:07:09,138
Oh...

1223
01:07:09,213 --> 01:07:11,875
'Cause I think I'm good enough to
figure out how to beat myself.

1224
01:07:11,950 --> 01:07:13,008
You push yourself.

1225
01:07:13,085 --> 01:07:15,053
You push yourself trying
to achieve the impossible,

1226
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:17,384
because you know
that when that moment comes

1227
01:07:17,456 --> 01:07:21,825
that everything you've done up to that
moment has prepared you for victory!

1228
01:07:22,262 --> 01:07:24,059
I can't take credit
for it, Mike.

1229
01:07:24,131 --> 01:07:27,623
I got to thank these little
digital guys with the big hearts.

1230
01:07:27,702 --> 01:07:30,398
Does it feel good to be
a champion? Yeah.

1231
01:07:30,472 --> 01:07:33,805
Yeah, it feels good to be a champion.
Good game.

1232
01:07:34,242 --> 01:07:36,870
Hey, Brooke,
are you ready to go now?

1233
01:07:37,914 --> 01:07:40,576
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure.
Great.

1234
01:07:40,650 --> 01:07:42,743
Hey, Gary, thanks a lot, man.
It was great to meet you.

1235
01:07:42,820 --> 01:07:44,185
Absolutely, man.

1236
01:07:45,322 --> 01:07:48,485
Come on, Mike. I know
a great little martini bar.

1237
01:08:11,385 --> 01:08:12,443
<i>Yo.</i>

1238
01:08:12,521 --> 01:08:14,580
Hey, man, saddle up.
It's time to rope in some talent.

1239
01:08:14,656 --> 01:08:15,645
<i>What's up? What do you got?</i>

1240
01:08:15,724 --> 01:08:18,284
My place. Tonight. Poker.
Call some girls up.

1241
01:08:19,863 --> 01:08:22,627
Your roommate is awesome.

1242
01:08:22,699 --> 01:08:23,927
Mmm.

1243
01:08:24,234 --> 01:08:25,963
Yeah, he's something.

1244
01:08:27,371 --> 01:08:30,431
So, where did you go to law school?
Oh, Northwestern.

1245
01:08:31,643 --> 01:08:33,543
God, Gary's hilarious.

1246
01:08:34,613 --> 01:08:36,205
Yeah, he's okay.

1247
01:08:36,749 --> 01:08:39,274
Okay? I mean,
the guy's all time.

1248
01:08:39,485 --> 01:08:42,921
But he's gonna take Chicago
tourism by air, land and sea.

1249
01:08:45,826 --> 01:08:47,885
And he asked me to join
his new bowling team.

1250
01:08:47,961 --> 01:08:49,986
I mean, how cool is that?

1251
01:08:50,064 --> 01:08:51,190
Mmm-hmm.

1252
01:08:51,966 --> 01:08:54,196
You know what? I can't do this.
I'm so sorry.

1253
01:08:54,269 --> 01:08:57,830
Excuse me, would you please pull over?
Can you pull over, please?

1254
01:09:04,548 --> 01:09:06,482
Hey, wait.

1255
01:09:08,085 --> 01:09:09,712
Tell Gary to call me.

1256
01:09:12,056 --> 01:09:13,182
<i>Welcome, everyone,</i>

1257
01:09:13,258 --> 01:09:16,557
to the first annual Texas Hold 'em
No-Limit Strip Poker Tournament.

1258
01:09:17,796 --> 01:09:21,357
Now, per the e-mail that Lupus sent, we
each have eight articles of clothing.

1259
01:09:21,434 --> 01:09:23,629
Now, if you want to bet, you
take off an article of clothing,

1260
01:09:23,703 --> 01:09:24,795
you put it in the center.

1261
01:09:24,872 --> 01:09:28,171
If you win, you take back the clothes,
you put back on what you bet.

1262
01:09:28,242 --> 01:09:30,335
The extras that other people
bet will stay in front of you,

1263
01:09:30,411 --> 01:09:31,673
much the same as chips would.

1264
01:09:31,746 --> 01:09:33,179
You can go all in at any point,

1265
01:09:33,248 --> 01:09:36,308
but as I outlined, you must take
off all your clothes to do so.

1266
01:09:36,384 --> 01:09:38,579
The game shall last an hour,
maybe two,

1267
01:09:38,654 --> 01:09:42,454
at which point we will begin the
dance portion of the evening.

1268
01:09:43,861 --> 01:09:45,055
Let's get going here.

1269
01:09:45,128 --> 01:09:46,322
I need to see the blinds.
Small blind. Big blind.

1270
01:09:46,396 --> 01:09:47,522
The blinds are one and one.

1271
01:09:47,598 --> 01:09:48,929
Come on, ladies.
All right.

1272
01:09:48,999 --> 01:09:51,024
Oh, yeah.
Let's get going here.

1273
01:09:51,703 --> 01:09:53,796
Shuffle up and deal.
All right.

1274
01:09:56,775 --> 01:09:58,333
I mean, just because they
were playing video games,

1275
01:09:58,410 --> 01:10:00,935
that doesn't mean
it didn't bother him, right?

1276
01:10:01,013 --> 01:10:04,414
Honestly, Brooke, I wish I could
tell you, but I wasn't there.

1277
01:10:04,618 --> 01:10:06,381
All right, Sally, get the
soap out of your mouth.

1278
01:10:06,453 --> 01:10:08,387
We're gonna save that
for when you're 12.

1279
01:10:08,456 --> 01:10:10,481
Mike was really,
really good-looking.

1280
01:10:10,558 --> 01:10:13,186
I mean, he's a little bit of a
goof, but Gary doesn't know that.

1281
01:10:13,261 --> 01:10:15,752
I mean, for all he knows,
a sophisticated,

1282
01:10:15,831 --> 01:10:18,595
really good-looking guy
took me out on a date tonight.

1283
01:10:18,667 --> 01:10:21,135
I could be in bed with this guy
right now for all he knows.

1284
01:10:21,204 --> 01:10:22,398
You know?

1285
01:10:22,505 --> 01:10:25,406
I'm telling you, if you
saw the look on his face,

1286
01:10:26,877 --> 01:10:28,401
Mike got to him.

1287
01:11:26,213 --> 01:11:27,202
Hello.

1288
01:11:27,314 --> 01:11:30,613
<i>Hey, it's Riggleman.
Great news.</i>

1289
01:12:39,999 --> 01:12:41,432
So, how does this work?

1290
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:44,094
I'll bring the car around front
and you wrap them up to go?

1291
01:12:44,170 --> 01:12:46,161
Oh, no, no.
We take care of everything.

1292
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:50,437
We deliver it. We hang it.
We check the light and the sun exposure.

1293
01:12:50,510 --> 01:12:52,239
Oh. Perfect.
Yeah.

1294
01:12:53,748 --> 01:12:56,216
Listen, I don't want to be
too forward,

1295
01:12:56,985 --> 01:13:00,113
but would you like to have
some dinner with me sometime?

1296
01:13:03,660 --> 01:13:06,322
I'm sorry. I have a boyfriend.

1297
01:13:06,429 --> 01:13:08,192
Of course.
So...

1298
01:13:08,264 --> 01:13:10,926
Well, he's a lucky man.
Oh, thank you.

1299
01:13:11,268 --> 01:13:15,466
I guess I will just have to keep it to
home deliveries and gallery purchases.

1300
01:13:16,775 --> 01:13:18,766
Thank you, though. See you.

1301
01:13:18,844 --> 01:13:21,005
Have a good day, Brooke.
You, too.

1302
01:13:29,289 --> 01:13:31,257
Okay, are you out of your mind?

1303
01:13:31,692 --> 01:13:33,887
Gary's throwing Greek orgies
in your living room

1304
01:13:33,962 --> 01:13:36,055
and you're telling hot rich
guys you have a boyfriend?

1305
01:13:36,131 --> 01:13:39,294
Are you nuts? Hey, look.
I'm not exactly innocent here.

1306
01:13:39,468 --> 01:13:42,062
Brooke, as an outsider with some
perspective, I really think you...

1307
01:13:42,138 --> 01:13:44,003
Christopher, stop. Stop it.
I don't want to hear it.

1308
01:13:44,073 --> 01:13:45,335
This has already gotten
way out of hand.

1309
01:13:45,407 --> 01:13:48,968
I know what I have to do now, all right?
I know what I have to do.

1310
01:14:08,935 --> 01:14:10,027
Hi.

1311
01:14:10,771 --> 01:14:11,760
Hi.

1312
01:14:14,441 --> 01:14:17,842
Did you get my note?
Yeah.

1313
01:14:19,814 --> 01:14:21,111
Two weeks.

1314
01:14:22,785 --> 01:14:23,774
Yep.

1315
01:14:26,989 --> 01:14:29,457
I brought some boxes from work,

1316
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:33,254
so, you know, if you need
any just help yourself.

1317
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:37,930
Great. Thanks.

1318
01:14:42,608 --> 01:14:43,700
Oh.

1319
01:14:43,776 --> 01:14:48,270
Listen, a while ago
I got these tickets

1320
01:14:48,348 --> 01:14:52,580
for the Old 97's tonight, and I
completely forgot about it, so I...

1321
01:14:54,055 --> 01:14:56,080
You know, if you want to go.

1322
01:14:59,962 --> 01:15:02,123
Well, how many tickets
did you get?

1323
01:15:02,731 --> 01:15:03,823
I got two.

1324
01:15:05,969 --> 01:15:08,164
How much do you want for them?

1325
01:15:08,705 --> 01:15:10,605
Oh, no, I'm going. I'm going.

1326
01:15:13,677 --> 01:15:16,043
So, then it would just be
the two of us?

1327
01:15:17,983 --> 01:15:21,885
Well, yes,
and 2,000 other people.

1328
01:15:22,855 --> 01:15:25,050
I mean, it's not a big deal,

1329
01:15:25,124 --> 01:15:27,991
but, you know, look, you know,
I was going to invite Addie,

1330
01:15:28,060 --> 01:15:31,154
but I just figured
I'd gotten them for you, so...

1331
01:15:38,273 --> 01:15:39,535
Sure. Why not?

1332
01:15:41,343 --> 01:15:43,106
Are you sure? I mean,
if you don't want them,

1333
01:15:43,178 --> 01:15:45,976
I can definitely give them to somebody.
No. No, I'll be there.

1334
01:15:46,048 --> 01:15:49,677
That sounds...
It sounds great.

1335
01:15:50,954 --> 01:15:54,651
Okay. All right.
It's at the Riv.

1336
01:15:55,693 --> 01:15:58,389
So, I'll just leave
your ticket at Will Call.

1337
01:15:59,831 --> 01:16:01,298
Good?
Okay.

1338
01:16:01,366 --> 01:16:02,355
Okay.

1339
01:16:09,108 --> 01:16:11,599
Yeah, so, there.
I'll just leave that for him. Okay, great.

1340
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:12,839
Okay, so.
Gary Grobowski?

1341
01:16:12,913 --> 01:16:14,471
Grobowski, yeah.
He should be here in a minute.

1342
01:16:14,548 --> 01:16:16,982
He's really... He's oddly tall, so.
Oh, okay. Great.

1343
01:16:17,052 --> 01:16:18,815
You won't miss him. Thanks.
All right, have a good night.

1344
01:16:42,414 --> 01:16:44,609
Hi. Can I get a beer, please?
Sure.

1345
01:16:44,683 --> 01:16:46,583
Actually, make that two beers.

1346
01:16:52,792 --> 01:16:55,022
It's gonna be $8.

1347
01:16:55,996 --> 01:16:57,554
Excuse me. Sorry.

1348
01:17:06,909 --> 01:17:08,638
<i>Hello, everybody!</i>

1349
01:17:09,078 --> 01:17:11,740
<i>Good evening, Chicago.
We're the Old 97's.</i>

1350
01:19:03,345 --> 01:19:04,334
Brooke?

1351
01:19:09,185 --> 01:19:11,551
Are you up?
Yeah.

1352
01:19:13,223 --> 01:19:15,714
Are you okay?
I'm fine.

1353
01:19:17,294 --> 01:19:20,559
Are you sure?
What's up? What do you want?

1354
01:19:24,168 --> 01:19:27,501
I just want to say I'm sorry
that I missed the concert,

1355
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:31,798
and let me know what that ticket
cost, I'll pay you back for it.

1356
01:19:36,082 --> 01:19:37,811
Just leave me alone, Gary.

1357
01:19:42,156 --> 01:19:44,181
I planned on going
to the concert.

1358
01:19:44,259 --> 01:19:45,749
It's just, I stopped by
Johnny O's and we...

1359
01:19:45,827 --> 01:19:47,158
It doesn't fucking matter,
okay?

1360
01:19:47,229 --> 01:19:49,891
Would you just leave my room
and shut the door?

1361
01:19:50,366 --> 01:19:52,357
Jesus.
Please.

1362
01:19:56,140 --> 01:19:59,132
I didn't really know that the concert
mattered all that much to you.

1363
01:19:59,209 --> 01:20:00,198
Exactly.

1364
01:20:01,212 --> 01:20:03,112
Hold on a second here.
Let me talk for a second.

1365
01:20:03,181 --> 01:20:04,170
Gary...

1366
01:20:04,249 --> 01:20:07,741
Brooke. You broke up with me.

1367
01:20:11,157 --> 01:20:13,022
Then you have guys
coming over here for dates,

1368
01:20:13,092 --> 01:20:15,253
and all of a sudden you ask
me to go to some concert.

1369
01:20:15,329 --> 01:20:16,990
I mean, I just figured that,
you know.

1370
01:20:17,064 --> 01:20:18,361
Gary.

1371
01:20:23,037 --> 01:20:25,403
I just... I don't know
how we got here.

1372
01:20:30,179 --> 01:20:31,908
Our entire relationship

1373
01:20:32,549 --> 01:20:36,417
I've gone above
and beyond for you, for us.

1374
01:20:38,789 --> 01:20:41,019
And I mean, I've cooked.

1375
01:20:42,493 --> 01:20:44,654
I've picked your shit up
off the floor.

1376
01:20:44,730 --> 01:20:48,257
I've laid your clothes out for you
like you were a four-year-old.

1377
01:20:49,167 --> 01:20:52,261
I support you.
I supported you, your work.

1378
01:20:53,373 --> 01:20:57,366
If we ever had dinner or
anything, I make the plans.

1379
01:20:57,444 --> 01:21:02,211
I take care of everything and I just don't
feel like you appreciate any of it.

1380
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:07,845
I don't feel you appreciate me.

1381
01:21:11,394 --> 01:21:16,229
And all I want is to...
Is for you to just show me that you care.

1382
01:21:22,106 --> 01:21:24,267
Why didn't you just
say that to me?

1383
01:21:24,976 --> 01:21:28,537
Gary, I've tried. I've tried.

1384
01:21:29,348 --> 01:21:31,043
Yeah, but never like that.

1385
01:21:32,585 --> 01:21:35,247
You might've said some things that
you meant to imply that, Brooke,

1386
01:21:35,321 --> 01:21:37,050
but I'm not a mind reader.

1387
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:42,120
I doubt it would matter.
You are who you are.

1388
01:21:45,834 --> 01:21:47,699
Just leave me alone, okay?

1389
01:21:49,671 --> 01:21:51,536
Right now. Just shut my door.

1390
01:21:56,145 --> 01:21:57,203
Listen.

1391
01:21:57,281 --> 01:21:59,806
All right, Gary, just, please.
Just leave the room.

1392
01:21:59,883 --> 01:22:00,907
Listen to me.
Gary, just...

1393
01:22:00,984 --> 01:22:03,452
I don't want to be near you right now.
Listen to me. I just want to...

1394
01:22:03,521 --> 01:22:06,581
Please, just shut the door.
Please.

1395
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:22,574
I know. Look, I know you feel bad, but,
you know, what are you gonna do?

1396
01:22:22,643 --> 01:22:25,441
I mean, what does she expect, for me to
want to go with the girl who dumped me?

1397
01:22:25,513 --> 01:22:28,243
I don't know. She probably just wanted
you, you know, to show her the respect

1398
01:22:28,317 --> 01:22:30,148
of not standing her up
or some shit, who knows?

1399
01:22:30,219 --> 01:22:32,050
Well, damn it. I should have
just said no in the first place.

1400
01:22:32,121 --> 01:22:33,179
I don't know why I called...

1401
01:22:33,256 --> 01:22:34,280
You know what?
It's her fault she got hurt.

1402
01:22:34,357 --> 01:22:38,350
You shouldn't even feel bad about it.
She should have expected it from you.

1403
01:22:41,132 --> 01:22:43,623
You're a fun guy, okay?
Everybody likes you.

1404
01:22:43,701 --> 01:22:47,193
You're the quickest guy I know.
Anytime we go out, I have a blast.

1405
01:22:47,272 --> 01:22:48,671
All right? But, you know,

1406
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:51,766
everybody who knows you knows you're
gonna do what you want to do.

1407
01:22:51,844 --> 01:22:56,008
And if it's not what the other person
wants to do, well, that's their problem.

1408
01:22:56,382 --> 01:22:57,610
That's bullshit.
It's not bullshit.

1409
01:22:57,684 --> 01:22:59,413
There's plenty of times I do
shit that I don't want to do.

1410
01:22:59,486 --> 01:23:00,885
That's ridiculous. No.
Like when?

1411
01:23:00,954 --> 01:23:02,046
That's bullshit to say
about me.

1412
01:23:02,122 --> 01:23:05,148
When have we ever done something
you didn't want to do?

1413
01:23:06,461 --> 01:23:09,362
You know, I don't know, off the top of my head.
I don't keep score...

1414
01:23:09,431 --> 01:23:11,661
When's the last time
we went to a Sox game?

1415
01:23:11,734 --> 01:23:13,065
The Sox.

1416
01:23:13,135 --> 01:23:15,626
Not when they're playing
the Cubs, either.

1417
01:23:16,406 --> 01:23:19,432
We always do what you want to do and
she always did what you want to do.

1418
01:23:19,509 --> 01:23:20,908
It's who you are.

1419
01:23:20,977 --> 01:23:23,502
Everybody thinks that
you're their friend, okay?

1420
01:23:23,581 --> 01:23:25,481
But the fact of the matter is
that there's not one person

1421
01:23:25,550 --> 01:23:27,347
that I know that you trust
enough to let close enough

1422
01:23:27,419 --> 01:23:28,443
that they could hurt you.

1423
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:32,388
And her big problem
is that you really liked her.

1424
01:23:32,457 --> 01:23:35,085
I mean, she is the one girl
you really liked.

1425
01:23:35,195 --> 01:23:37,060
And no matter what she did
and how hard she tried,

1426
01:23:37,130 --> 01:23:39,257
you were never gonna
let your guard down.

1427
01:23:39,332 --> 01:23:41,527
That poor girl
never stood a chance.

1428
01:24:20,146 --> 01:24:21,135
Marilyn?

1429
01:24:24,552 --> 01:24:26,520
Marilyn?
Yeah.

1430
01:24:30,826 --> 01:24:35,160
I'm sorry. I just...

1431
01:24:35,765 --> 01:24:36,925
Oh, just get in here.

1432
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,230
Oh, okay.
I'm sorry, excuse me.

1433
01:24:40,170 --> 01:24:41,603
Marilyn, I just...

1434
01:24:41,672 --> 01:24:45,199
I just wanted to let you know that
today is gonna be my last day.

1435
01:24:47,812 --> 01:24:50,144
I'm gonna be traveling
for a bit.

1436
01:24:59,726 --> 01:25:01,216
Here's a blank check.

1437
01:25:01,295 --> 01:25:05,231
Write down a number, I don't want to
know what it is, and go back to work.

1438
01:25:05,366 --> 01:25:07,732
No, no. It's not about that.

1439
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:10,760
I can't accept that.

1440
01:25:12,207 --> 01:25:13,231
Brooke.

1441
01:25:14,443 --> 01:25:17,003
Travis, get your gorgeous
tuckus out of here.

1442
01:25:25,589 --> 01:25:27,853
If you make it to Rome,

1443
01:25:28,125 --> 01:25:31,993
search out an establishment
called the Padre Negro.

1444
01:25:32,297 --> 01:25:36,097
Ask for a strapping young
fellow named Alberto.

1445
01:25:36,936 --> 01:25:38,927
Compliments of M. Dean.

1446
01:25:42,009 --> 01:25:44,944
Well, thank you.
I appreciate that.

1447
01:25:45,179 --> 01:25:47,739
Yeah. And, honey,

1448
01:25:48,917 --> 01:25:51,511
take as long as you want,
because when you're done,

1449
01:25:51,586 --> 01:25:54,146
your job will be right here
waiting for you.

1450
01:25:55,257 --> 01:25:59,318
And if you discover a path
that doesn't lead back here...

1451
01:26:00,464 --> 01:26:02,398
Well, I hope you'll text.

1452
01:26:05,636 --> 01:26:06,898
I will.

1453
01:26:16,882 --> 01:26:20,147
And, like I said, the apartment's
a mess, but I'm moving, so...

1454
01:26:20,220 --> 01:26:22,916
It's okay. Relax about
the place. I don't care.

1455
01:26:22,990 --> 01:26:25,390
Okay. This'll just take a second.
Okay.

1456
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:35,529
Hello?
Hey. I'm in here.

1457
01:26:42,980 --> 01:26:45,278
Don't say anything. I...

1458
01:26:46,450 --> 01:26:47,974
How're you doing?

1459
01:26:54,693 --> 01:26:57,218
Could I talk to you in private
for a second?

1460
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:02,130
You know what?
This is really not a good time,

1461
01:27:02,202 --> 01:27:04,727
and obviously you have
something happening here,

1462
01:27:04,805 --> 01:27:07,205
so we'll just be in...
No, no, I don't have anything going on.

1463
01:27:07,275 --> 01:27:09,573
This is actually for you.

1464
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:14,312
I'm just gonna wait outside.
No, no. Wait.

1465
01:27:14,383 --> 01:27:16,408
No, no. Really. It's okay.

1466
01:27:19,189 --> 01:27:21,248
I really can't do this
right now.

1467
01:27:21,324 --> 01:27:24,225
Brooke, this whole thing
has been really tough on me

1468
01:27:24,728 --> 01:27:27,663
and I've tried to act like it
hasn't been that tough on me,

1469
01:27:27,731 --> 01:27:30,427
but the first Sunday
after me and you broke up,

1470
01:27:30,535 --> 01:27:32,526
it all kind of really hit me.

1471
01:27:33,071 --> 01:27:34,504
And I think it partially hit me

1472
01:27:34,573 --> 01:27:38,009
because Sunday was sort of always our
day that we would do stuff together.

1473
01:27:38,077 --> 01:27:41,706
But I didn't have any idea
you still cared so much.

1474
01:27:42,749 --> 01:27:45,912
And, you know, when I saw
you crying the other night,

1475
01:27:46,253 --> 01:27:49,279
that was honestly
the worst moment of my life.

1476
01:27:51,526 --> 01:27:52,550
Gary.

1477
01:27:52,627 --> 01:27:55,994
Let me just try to say some of
these things here. It's just...

1478
01:27:56,499 --> 01:27:57,693
Look,

1479
01:27:59,201 --> 01:28:02,796
I know that I've caused you
a lot of pain.

1480
01:28:04,274 --> 01:28:08,233
And the funny thing is, all I really
want to do is make you happy.

1481
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:11,180
I just want to make you smile.

1482
01:28:11,249 --> 01:28:14,241
Now, I've had a lot of time to
think about some of the things

1483
01:28:14,319 --> 01:28:17,550
that went on, and I know, Brooke, that
I don't always do the right thing

1484
01:28:17,623 --> 01:28:19,591
or always say the right things,

1485
01:28:19,659 --> 01:28:22,457
but I am willing to try
to do things differently.

1486
01:28:22,662 --> 01:28:25,153
And I'd be happy to go
take a dance class.

1487
01:28:25,266 --> 01:28:28,827
Well, I would. Honestly.
I would like to go do that. Or go travel.

1488
01:28:28,969 --> 01:28:31,631
I mean, I'd even be willing
to go to the ballet.

1489
01:28:31,706 --> 01:28:36,643
Although I would much rather do the
dance class or take a trip somewhere.

1490
01:28:36,979 --> 01:28:38,640
But I realize
that's not the point.

1491
01:28:38,714 --> 01:28:40,841
I realize that the point
isn't that at all,

1492
01:28:40,917 --> 01:28:45,013
because it's not really about doing
things that you love to do always,

1493
01:28:45,088 --> 01:28:48,683
but it is about doing things
with the person that you love.

1494
01:28:49,561 --> 01:28:51,688
And I love you.

1495
01:28:55,234 --> 01:28:58,135
Gary.
Just give me one second here.

1496
01:28:59,338 --> 01:29:01,203
I've missed you so much.

1497
01:29:04,477 --> 01:29:05,967
I promise you, Brooke,

1498
01:29:06,046 --> 01:29:10,449
I will do whatever it is that I
have to do to never hurt you again.

1499
01:29:11,385 --> 01:29:15,253
I love you and I'm sorry.

1500
01:29:18,962 --> 01:29:21,055
Okay, that's it.
That's all I...

1501
01:29:22,799 --> 01:29:24,562
Oh, God.
That's all I wanted to say,

1502
01:29:24,634 --> 01:29:28,195
so you can go ahead now with
anything that you're feeling to say.

1503
01:29:31,710 --> 01:29:33,439
I don't know what to say.

1504
01:29:34,546 --> 01:29:36,741
Just say whatever
you feel inside.

1505
01:29:44,524 --> 01:29:46,788
I don't feel the same way.

1506
01:29:51,199 --> 01:29:53,667
I don't. I just...
I don't know.

1507
01:29:54,736 --> 01:29:56,033
Oh, God.

1508
01:29:58,240 --> 01:30:01,266
I just, I think...
I don't know,

1509
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:03,539
but I don't think I have

1510
01:30:04,014 --> 01:30:07,643
anything left to give.

1511
01:30:10,254 --> 01:30:11,653
I'm sorry.

1512
01:30:18,797 --> 01:30:20,628
I was hoping for...

1513
01:30:25,171 --> 01:30:26,570
It doesn't matter.

1514
01:30:32,414 --> 01:30:34,609
Oh, this is now beyond awkward.

1515
01:30:34,683 --> 01:30:37,481
There's some new guy
standing out in the hallway

1516
01:30:37,553 --> 01:30:41,489
and I think I'm gonna go.

1517
01:30:46,430 --> 01:30:47,624
Okay.

1518
01:30:51,336 --> 01:30:52,803
Thank you.

1519
01:30:56,542 --> 01:30:59,272
I made a dinner, and I don't
know if it's any good or not,

1520
01:30:59,345 --> 01:31:01,279
but you're welcome to have it.

1521
01:31:02,615 --> 01:31:03,707
Okay.

1522
01:31:08,589 --> 01:31:11,285
Gary, that's really...
That's not what you think that it is.

1523
01:31:11,359 --> 01:31:12,485
It's okay.

1524
01:31:13,929 --> 01:31:15,829
I'm gonna go take a walk.

1525
01:31:40,259 --> 01:31:42,523
I'm sorry about that.
No.

1526
01:31:42,828 --> 01:31:46,127
I'm sorry I imposed.
No, that's fine. Please.

1527
01:31:47,768 --> 01:31:51,636
So, what do you think?
I think you're right.

1528
01:31:51,706 --> 01:31:54,038
I think it's great.
Good.

1529
01:31:54,742 --> 01:31:56,334
Okay.
Okay.

1530
01:31:56,412 --> 01:31:57,538
So,

1531
01:31:59,314 --> 01:32:02,374
I will have that wrapped up.

1532
01:32:02,452 --> 01:32:05,182
Packed up, sorry,
and delivered.

1533
01:32:06,055 --> 01:32:07,989
Thank you for taking the time
to show it to me, okay?

1534
01:32:08,057 --> 01:32:09,183
Sure.

1535
01:32:09,393 --> 01:32:11,918
Yeah. I'm gonna run.
Okay, I'll walk you out.

1536
01:32:11,996 --> 01:32:14,328
No, no, no.
I can... It's okay.

1537
01:32:28,348 --> 01:32:31,408
So, the thing that I was most
afraid of happening happened

1538
01:32:31,485 --> 01:32:36,013
and I don't regret it at all,
because now she knows how I feel.

1539
01:32:38,326 --> 01:32:41,056
Do you know what I mean?
Yeah.

1540
01:32:41,130 --> 01:32:45,328
I think, what you got to do
now is really think hard,

1541
01:32:46,403 --> 01:32:48,496
because you have
to find somebody

1542
01:32:49,573 --> 01:32:52,041
that can't be traced back
to either of us

1543
01:32:53,311 --> 01:32:55,006
to visit this guy.

1544
01:32:55,446 --> 01:32:57,573
What are you talking about?
I don't...

1545
01:32:57,649 --> 01:32:59,378
The guy who came with her.

1546
01:32:59,451 --> 01:33:01,885
I don't need anything
to happen to the guy.

1547
01:33:01,954 --> 01:33:03,615
But if they could trace him
back to either one of us...

1548
01:33:03,690 --> 01:33:05,817
It's not about him. I don't care about that.
...it's a problem.

1549
01:33:05,892 --> 01:33:08,486
The guy, he's not a... They're not dumb.
Cops are smart, trust me.

1550
01:33:08,561 --> 01:33:10,495
Okay, but he's not a problem to me.
Right.

1551
01:33:10,564 --> 01:33:12,361
Listen to me.

1552
01:33:12,433 --> 01:33:15,869
Promise me that you're
not gonna do anything.

1553
01:33:15,937 --> 01:33:17,029
I got you.

1554
01:33:17,706 --> 01:33:20,072
It's better if nobody...
You don't know anything.

1555
01:33:20,141 --> 01:33:21,631
What are you talking about?
I'll take care of it.

1556
01:33:21,711 --> 01:33:23,702
I don't want you to take care of anything.
John, do me a favor.

1557
01:33:23,779 --> 01:33:26,805
I'm being serious with you.
I know, I know. Smart. You're smart.

1558
01:33:26,883 --> 01:33:28,214
No, I'm not.
I'm being honest with you.

1559
01:33:28,285 --> 01:33:29,684
I don't want anything to happen to him.
Me, either.

1560
01:33:29,753 --> 01:33:31,812
Promise me you're not gonna have
anyone do anything to this guy.

1561
01:33:31,889 --> 01:33:33,789
But you've gotta tell me exactly
what you're gonna tell them,

1562
01:33:33,858 --> 01:33:35,758
if the cops come to you.
Because if we tell a different story...

1563
01:33:35,827 --> 01:33:37,624
Nothing. Promise me one thing.
We don't care...

1564
01:33:37,695 --> 01:33:39,686
John, I'm gonna go home.
I can't do this. I'm exhausted.

1565
01:33:39,765 --> 01:33:42,097
Right, go home. Just make sure your
neighbors know you're going home.

1566
01:33:42,167 --> 01:33:45,864
Do me a favor. They got phone records.
Make a couple phone calls tonight.

1567
01:33:45,939 --> 01:33:47,668
Especially around 10:00.

1568
01:33:48,575 --> 01:33:51,066
Okay. Please don't
do anything. All right.

1569
01:33:51,144 --> 01:33:52,805
I don't mean it like...
I mean, honestly.

1570
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:54,245
No, no, I got it.

1571
01:33:58,787 --> 01:34:01,085
For all you know,
nothing's happening.

1572
01:34:01,590 --> 01:34:03,922
I don't want anything to happen.
Right.

1573
01:34:03,993 --> 01:34:05,358
Say it louder.

1574
01:35:34,364 --> 01:35:36,457
What are you doing here
so early?

1575
01:35:59,027 --> 01:36:00,051
Hey.

1576
01:36:03,265 --> 01:36:06,530
Everything okay with you and...
Yeah, everything's gonna be great.

1577
01:36:06,602 --> 01:36:11,062
I just wanna get my day started,
but I just wanted to say that

1578
01:36:11,909 --> 01:36:14,639
I'm sorry it took
so long for me to...

1579
01:36:16,346 --> 01:36:17,779
I love you, Dennis.

1580
01:36:19,751 --> 01:36:21,981
It's all right. It's okay.

1581
01:36:23,622 --> 01:36:26,489
I'm sorry. I'm gonna go
do the stuff.

1582
01:36:53,089 --> 01:36:55,114
So, that's it for all my stuff.

1583
01:36:58,229 --> 01:37:02,325
If you want, you could give me your key
and I'll drop it off at Riggleman's.

1584
01:37:02,801 --> 01:37:04,063
All right.

1585
01:37:13,413 --> 01:37:14,607
Thanks.

1586
01:37:15,783 --> 01:37:16,772
Gary.

1587
01:37:17,685 --> 01:37:21,177
You know, there's
a thousand things I...

1588
01:37:22,190 --> 01:37:24,158
I would have done differently.

1589
01:37:26,328 --> 01:37:27,522
Me, too.

1590
01:37:29,565 --> 01:37:34,025
Sort of, actually, when I see this space,
I realize that if we didn't have

1591
01:37:34,104 --> 01:37:37,904
such a big coffee table
and that oversized couch

1592
01:37:39,277 --> 01:37:43,737
a pool table
would have fit nicely.

1593
01:37:43,916 --> 01:37:45,008
Yeah.

1594
01:37:45,851 --> 01:37:50,811
Although the oversized couch did come in
very useful the last couple of weeks, so...

1595
01:37:50,990 --> 01:37:52,651
Yes, it... I guess.

1596
01:37:58,599 --> 01:37:59,964
Have a good trip.

1597
01:38:02,370 --> 01:38:03,667
Thanks.

1598
01:38:13,417 --> 01:38:15,612
<i>Chicago is called
the Second City</i>

1599
01:38:15,686 --> 01:38:18,917
<i>because after the
Great Chicago Fire of 1871,</i>

1600
01:38:18,990 --> 01:38:20,719
<i>Chicago was rebuilt
on its ruins.</i>

1601
01:38:20,792 --> 01:38:24,489
<i>The city came back even bigger and
stronger than it originally was.</i>

1602
01:38:24,563 --> 01:38:28,522
<i>So it's not really an insult, it's more
of a badge of honor to be called...</i>

1603
01:38:29,268 --> 01:38:30,758
The Second City!

1604
01:38:31,705 --> 01:38:33,332
<i>Okay. People, you might
be able to get away</i>

1605
01:38:33,406 --> 01:38:35,772
<i>with that reaction at work,
but you are on vacation here.</i>

1606
01:38:35,842 --> 01:38:39,141
<i>If you can't blow it out here, then
where the hell can you blow it out?</i>

1607
01:38:39,213 --> 01:38:41,078
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
show me that you mean it.</i>

1608
01:38:41,148 --> 01:38:43,343
<i>Do not make me ask you twice.</i>

1609
01:38:43,819 --> 01:38:46,014
<i>Are you ready to see Chicago?
Yes!</i>

1610
01:38:46,088 --> 01:38:48,283
<i>I said, are you ready
to see Chicago? Yes!</i>

1611
01:38:48,357 --> 01:38:52,657
<i>Are you ready to see Chicago?
Shondra, put this babe in the air.</i>

1612
01:38:52,729 --> 01:38:53,753
<i>Let's go!</i>

1613
01:38:54,230 --> 01:38:56,892
<i>There is a bar downstairs.
Please enjoy yourself.</i>

1614
01:38:56,967 --> 01:38:59,094
<i>I know it's early in the morning,
but it is Chicago in the summer.</i>

1615
01:38:59,169 --> 01:39:00,295
<i>Who are we kidding? It's fine.</i>

1616
01:39:00,371 --> 01:39:02,202
<i>Go get hopped up,
make some bad decisions.</i>

1617
01:39:02,274 --> 01:39:04,435
<i>My jokes get better.
The buildings look bigger.</i>

1618
01:39:24,165 --> 01:39:26,963
It's not so important
that everything is finished.

1619
01:39:27,036 --> 01:39:29,436
It's important that
everything is right.

1620
01:39:29,538 --> 01:39:31,699
Well, what time's
the presentation?

1621
01:39:31,841 --> 01:39:34,605
All right, I'll pick up the rest of
the stuff and I'll see you at 6:45.

1622
01:39:34,678 --> 01:39:36,236
Great. Bye.

1623
01:39:36,713 --> 01:39:37,941
Brooke!

1624
01:39:43,555 --> 01:39:46,353
Hi.
Hi.

1625
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:49,154
Wow.

1626
01:39:51,197 --> 01:39:54,098
It's good to see you.
It's good to see you.

1627
01:39:54,267 --> 01:39:58,533
I'd give you a hug, but my hands are
kind of full with all the bags here.

1628
01:40:00,941 --> 01:40:03,273
How've you been?
I've been really good.

1629
01:40:03,345 --> 01:40:05,813
How have you been?
I've been good.

1630
01:40:06,414 --> 01:40:07,676
Yeah.

1631
01:40:08,818 --> 01:40:10,683
You look great.
Thank you.

1632
01:40:10,753 --> 01:40:14,052
The hair's a little different.
Looks nice. Yeah? Oh, yeah.

1633
01:40:14,992 --> 01:40:18,587
You've lost some weight.
Well, it's very deceiving, actually.

1634
01:40:18,662 --> 01:40:23,497
I've managed to become thin without
having any real muscle on me whatsoever.

1635
01:40:23,601 --> 01:40:26,866
Very tough thing to accomplish, by the way.
I'm proud of myself.

1636
01:40:26,939 --> 01:40:29,430
Well, you look terrific.
Thanks.

1637
01:40:30,542 --> 01:40:33,943
I heard your trip went really well.
It did. It went really well.

1638
01:40:34,014 --> 01:40:35,606
Oh, good.
It was fun. It was amazing.

1639
01:40:35,682 --> 01:40:38,242
I saw so many amazing places.
It was just...

1640
01:40:38,619 --> 01:40:42,817
But, you know, you do realize
how much you love home.

1641
01:40:43,491 --> 01:40:46,927
It's good to have you back.
Yeah. It's good to be back.

1642
01:40:49,766 --> 01:40:52,792
And the boat.
Congratulations on the boat. Thanks.

1643
01:40:52,902 --> 01:40:55,769
I'm waiting for it to get warm, and
I'm gonna come by and take a ride.

1644
01:40:55,839 --> 01:40:58,672
Well, anytime you want.
It'll be on the house. Come on by.

1645
01:40:58,742 --> 01:41:00,801
Well, I will, then.

1646
01:41:02,247 --> 01:41:03,737
I hope you do.

1647
01:41:05,083 --> 01:41:06,243
Definitely.

1648
01:41:10,289 --> 01:41:13,122
Well, I got to...
I'm going to a meeting, so...

1649
01:41:13,192 --> 01:41:17,993
I got to drop these bags off anyway, but
it's really good to see you, Brooke.

1650
01:41:18,398 --> 01:41:21,026
Really good to see you.
Shouldn't...

1651
01:41:21,836 --> 01:41:23,269
Sorry.
I'm sorry.

1652
01:41:23,337 --> 01:41:26,704
I'm just saying we shouldn't wait
so long the next time before we...

1653
01:41:26,775 --> 01:41:28,140
Yeah.
...catch up.

1654
01:41:28,210 --> 01:41:30,610
We have a lot more to talk about.
Yeah.

1655
01:41:31,013 --> 01:41:32,002
So.

1656
01:41:33,349 --> 01:41:34,976
Be good.
Okay.

1657
01:41:35,051 --> 01:41:36,245
Bye.
Bye.
