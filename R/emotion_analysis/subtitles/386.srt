1
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:19,986
Let's go! Move it!

2
00:01:21,862 --> 00:01:23,352
50 more yards!

3
00:01:23,464 --> 00:01:24,829
All right, let's go! Pick it up!

4
00:01:24,932 --> 00:01:26,331
-Let's go!
-Yes, sir!

5
00:01:26,433 --> 00:01:29,094
You're running out of time, Bryant!

6
00:01:29,202 --> 00:01:30,965
Make it all the way around the track!
Come on!

7
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,901
You want to be troopers?
You better move it!

8
00:01:33,005 --> 00:01:34,495
All right, next, get up here!

9
00:01:34,607 --> 00:01:36,006
Let's hit it now.

10
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:37,235
Dean, come on!

11
00:01:37,343 --> 00:01:40,471
All right.
You've all completed the written exam.

12
00:01:40,613 --> 00:01:44,139
However, you must now pass
the obstacle course

13
00:01:44,249 --> 00:01:46,774
to be admitted into the training program.

14
00:01:46,885 --> 00:01:49,718
And remember, survive this,

15
00:01:49,821 --> 00:01:52,790
and you're on the front lines
of keeping New Jersey safe.

16
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:29,916
Yeah.

17
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:54,070
Sorry about the test, Dad.

18
00:02:55,149 --> 00:02:58,243
We all have our crosses to bear, sweetheart.

19
00:02:58,352 --> 00:03:00,547
Mine is named hypoglycemia.

20
00:03:00,655 --> 00:03:04,055
Well, that's why you always have to have
sugar nearby.

21
00:03:05,192 --> 00:03:07,057
Are you gonna have pie?

22
00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:10,729
Not tonight, Ma.

23
00:03:10,831 --> 00:03:14,062
I'm just kidding.
Yeah, I'm gonna want some pie.

24
00:03:16,336 --> 00:03:17,462
You...

25
00:03:18,572 --> 00:03:21,472
No, I meant now, Ma. Get the pie now.

26
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,699
-Okay.
-You said it,

27
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,268
and I just kind of got that
stuck in my head now,

28
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,440
and can't really get it out. Pie. Here we go.

29
00:03:33,152 --> 00:03:34,779
It really helps heal.

30
00:03:34,887 --> 00:03:37,787
And, you know, not always, but sometimes,

31
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:41,416
you gotta do like the kids say,
and just say, "Whatever."

32
00:03:41,526 --> 00:03:42,652
Kids don't talk like that.

33
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,990
Some do, sweetheart. The older ones, okay?

34
00:03:45,096 --> 00:03:47,496
I hear them in the mall. You know?

35
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,590
Peanut butter.

36
00:03:51,636 --> 00:03:54,263
It just fills the cracks of the heart.

37
00:03:56,373 --> 00:03:58,238
Go away, pain.

38
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:04,738
-What?
-Paulie.

39
00:04:04,848 --> 00:04:06,873
Oh, no. Come on, Ma.

40
00:04:06,984 --> 00:04:08,713
I'm not ready for this right now.

41
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:10,046
-Dad.
-Please.

42
00:04:10,152 --> 00:04:14,088
We just don't want to see you go through
another holiday alone.

43
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,817
But I'm not alone.

44
00:04:15,925 --> 00:04:17,790
I've got you two. You know?

45
00:04:17,894 --> 00:04:20,522
And besides, Black Friday's coming,

46
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,121
so my dance card's gonna be pretty full.

47
00:04:23,232 --> 00:04:26,029
What?
It's the busiest shopping day of the year.

48
00:04:26,134 --> 00:04:28,568
Yeah, I should have known better
than to try to explain it to civilians.

49
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,730
I wish I had a coworker here, like, "Tyler,
hey. You know, Black Friday's coming."

50
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,603
"Gee, Paul, you don't have to tell me
Black Friday's coming.

51
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:34,732
"Why do you think
I've been walking around here

52
00:04:34,843 --> 00:04:36,037
"with the eyes of an eagle?"

53
00:04:36,144 --> 00:04:38,578
-We prepare.
-Dad, what does all that have to do

54
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,773
with being happy for the rest of your life?

55
00:04:40,882 --> 00:04:45,545
You said, and I quote,
"lf I don't have a girlfriend by November,

56
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:48,918
"I'll let you sign me up
for perfectmatch.com."

57
00:04:50,024 --> 00:04:51,719
That was last year.

58
00:04:58,431 --> 00:04:59,489
Okay.

59
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,261
-Here we are.
-Okay.

60
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:05,929
"What are you looking for in a woman?"

61
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:09,099
Well, your mother certainly
had something special.

62
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,809
Yeah, illegal immigrant status.

63
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:16,472
She married you, got citizenship,
and then she left us.

64
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:18,516
That's not entirely true.

65
00:05:18,617 --> 00:05:22,610
We did have some good times
back when she was still trying to trick me.

66
00:05:22,721 --> 00:05:24,951
-Well, I hate her.
-Well, you shouldn't.

67
00:05:25,057 --> 00:05:26,649
She gave me you.

68
00:05:28,393 --> 00:05:30,986
-I am pretty great.
-You are. You are.

69
00:05:31,596 --> 00:05:34,156
Okay, next question.
"Tell us about yourself."

70
00:05:34,932 --> 00:05:36,729
Let's see.

71
00:05:36,834 --> 00:05:38,199
I know a lot about sharks.

72
00:05:38,302 --> 00:05:40,429
Let me stop you right there.

73
00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:47,135
Well-built and a great hugger.

74
00:05:47,243 --> 00:05:48,710
Awesome, Grandma.

75
00:05:48,812 --> 00:05:50,973
Not as awesome as this.

76
00:05:51,081 --> 00:05:52,343
What are you doing?

77
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:56,783
Beefing up your profile with that
nifty video that you made a few years back.

78
00:05:56,886 --> 00:05:58,217
Ma, no.

79
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:20,097
I don't know. Don't you think
it's a little too, "Hey, look at me"?

80
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,676
Well, that is exactly what we want.

81
00:06:22,777 --> 00:06:24,244
Eyes on the prize.

82
00:06:24,345 --> 00:06:27,508
And don't worry,
I will edit out the sweaty parts.

83
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:56,569
Dear God!

84
00:06:59,612 --> 00:07:02,308
Hey! Back away from the vehicle.

85
00:07:02,982 --> 00:07:04,745
Oh, dear God. Please.

86
00:07:05,151 --> 00:07:06,846
Chompers, get down!

87
00:07:28,405 --> 00:07:29,667
Hey, you know where a men's room is?

88
00:07:29,773 --> 00:07:31,673
I do.
You're gonna want to go to Lord and Taylor.

89
00:07:31,775 --> 00:07:33,709
They got 12 stalls and heated seats.

90
00:07:37,448 --> 00:07:40,349
Okay, keep the balls in the pit, kids. Kids!

91
00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:43,514
Okay, my lip is numb.

92
00:07:48,925 --> 00:07:50,256
All righty.

93
00:07:52,962 --> 00:07:56,193
-There you go.
-Thank you.

94
00:08:24,859 --> 00:08:25,883
Hey.

95
00:08:27,561 --> 00:08:28,994
Yeah, I know.

96
00:08:33,199 --> 00:08:36,259
That's not supposed to be here.
It's a minivan.

97
00:08:37,537 --> 00:08:41,166
...he can't handle it.
The puck travels to the far board...

98
00:08:41,975 --> 00:08:43,909
He keeps the play alive.

99
00:09:06,364 --> 00:09:08,264
-Paul!
-Hey.

100
00:09:08,366 --> 00:09:09,663
What is this?

101
00:09:09,767 --> 00:09:12,065
That's my report on how to ease
traffic flow from Macy's

102
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,728
down through the specialty shops.

103
00:09:13,838 --> 00:09:16,898
-How's that working out for you?
-Actually, it's for all of us.

104
00:09:17,008 --> 00:09:19,407
You see, if we could reroute the customers
away from the food court,

105
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:22,478
it's gonna help the kiosks
and cut down on shopper frustration.

106
00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:25,605
It's your classic two-bird,
one-stone scenario.

107
00:09:27,517 --> 00:09:29,678
-Can I ask you something?
-Anything.

108
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:34,086
Why can't you just punch in, shut up
and punch out like the rest of us?

109
00:09:35,124 --> 00:09:37,183
Safety never takes a holiday.

110
00:09:37,293 --> 00:09:39,386
Did your mom crochet that on a pillow?

111
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:40,621
Blart.

112
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:45,266
This is Sims. He's a new trainee.
Let him trail you today.

113
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:48,632
Hey. Paul Blart. Ten-year veteran.

114
00:09:48,737 --> 00:09:50,966
Wow. Veck Sims.

115
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:55,566
Well, Veck Sims, welcome to the show.
Let's mount up.

116
00:09:58,012 --> 00:10:00,344
Oh, yeah. That's the good stuff.

117
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,719
That's it. Treat her gentle, son.

118
00:10:09,323 --> 00:10:11,086
Slap it, honor it.

119
00:10:12,693 --> 00:10:15,594
So what made you want to pursue security?

120
00:10:21,935 --> 00:10:24,528
I never finished high school.
This is all I could get.

121
00:10:24,637 --> 00:10:27,128
Yeah, I'm currently working on becoming
a state trooper, myself.

122
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,368
Right now, I'm goose egg for eight.
Hypoglycemia.

123
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:39,850
Confusing, right? Cut yourself some slack.

124
00:10:39,951 --> 00:10:42,351
My first week riding on the job,
I got lost behind the Sears.

125
00:10:42,454 --> 00:10:46,390
They found me later in the fetal position,
sporting a full beard.

126
00:10:46,491 --> 00:10:48,049
I'm kidding. I can't grow a beard.

127
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:50,093
My uncle can. Stay snug.

128
00:10:50,729 --> 00:10:53,755
Now, in the event
that you approach an assailant,

129
00:10:53,865 --> 00:10:56,697
here's what I want you to do.
You're gonna pull up,

130
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,464
Ieft hip forward, placing your right hand
on your away hip thusly,

131
00:11:01,572 --> 00:11:05,668
giving the illusion that you have a gun.
Which, of course, we both know

132
00:11:05,776 --> 00:11:07,073
you don't.

133
00:11:07,945 --> 00:11:10,436
Okay? But you know what we do have?

134
00:11:10,814 --> 00:11:13,077
Our voices! We have our voices.

135
00:11:13,883 --> 00:11:16,511
If you remember one thing
from today, it's this.

136
00:11:16,619 --> 00:11:21,215
The mind is the only weapon
that doesn't need a holster.

137
00:11:22,492 --> 00:11:24,653
Right. Awesome.
How long do we get for lunch?

138
00:11:24,761 --> 00:11:27,924
Half hour. But I eat in 20, which leaves me
five minutes for social time,

139
00:11:28,031 --> 00:11:30,225
five minutes to get refocused.

140
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,669
We got a high roller.

141
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,312
Sir, I'm gonna need you to pull to the right.

142
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,848
Please pull to the side, sir. Out of traffic.

143
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:53,080
Tan jacket, red scooter,
please pull to the right, out of traffic.

144
00:11:53,187 --> 00:11:54,245
Sir.

145
00:11:57,191 --> 00:11:58,488
Thank you.

146
00:12:11,471 --> 00:12:13,701
Driving kind of recklessly back there, sir.

147
00:12:13,807 --> 00:12:15,240
You're kidding.

148
00:12:15,342 --> 00:12:18,003
I don't joke about shopper safety.

149
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,702
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to
issue you a citation.

150
00:12:19,812 --> 00:12:22,781
Gonna need your first and last. Last first.

151
00:12:23,816 --> 00:12:25,875
Sir. Sir. Sir, sir, sir.

152
00:12:27,152 --> 00:12:29,313
Please don't make this more difficult
than it needs to be, okay?

153
00:12:29,421 --> 00:12:32,913
Are you able to...
Sir. Sir! Sir. I am warning you, sir.

154
00:12:37,362 --> 00:12:39,057
You're pushing it.

155
00:12:39,964 --> 00:12:42,159
Sir. Sir. I am warning... Sir.

156
00:12:43,034 --> 00:12:46,663
Sir. Sir. Sir.

157
00:12:50,173 --> 00:12:51,231
Okay.

158
00:12:52,342 --> 00:12:55,743
This is adding up, sir. He'll be back.
He'll be back. He'll be back.

159
00:13:25,206 --> 00:13:27,504
-Hey.
-Hi. Do you need something?

160
00:13:29,277 --> 00:13:32,075
Yes. I'd like to welcome you to our mall.

161
00:13:32,847 --> 00:13:34,405
Well, thank you.

162
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,257
Is there something else?

163
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:47,449
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

164
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:50,621
Just looking for some hair extensions.

165
00:13:50,731 --> 00:13:53,825
Need a little more volume up top.
Do you do men?

166
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:58,103
Do you do men hair? Do you do men hair?
On the men?

167
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:01,173
Are you the guy
that crashed into the minivan?

168
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,536
I don't think so. Which one?

169
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:07,306
Well, that one. That one right there.

170
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,675
Yeah. That one, yes. That...
You know, that one was me.

171
00:14:11,783 --> 00:14:13,978
-Oh, wow. Are you okay?
-Oh, yeah. Never better.

172
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:15,849
Although they're docking the paycheck
pretty good.

173
00:14:15,954 --> 00:14:17,319
Yeah.

174
00:14:17,422 --> 00:14:19,686
You know what you should do?
You should get the security tape,

175
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:23,318
and then, like, sell it to one of those shows,
you know, where people crash into stuff.

176
00:14:23,428 --> 00:14:26,192
-Hello, early retirement.
-Yeah, right?

177
00:14:27,832 --> 00:14:31,290
Volume. Right, let me just see what I've got.

178
00:14:36,006 --> 00:14:39,737
Yeah, this is Blart.
If you need me, I'm over by the kiosks.

179
00:14:40,544 --> 00:14:41,943
Who is this?

180
00:14:44,581 --> 00:14:47,675
It's Officer Blart, reporting from Sector 5.

181
00:14:48,284 --> 00:14:50,377
What the hell are you bothering me for?

182
00:14:52,122 --> 00:14:54,647
-Just a Code B check.
-What a moron.

183
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,619
You know, I'll check in with them later.
It's pretty intense.

184
00:14:57,727 --> 00:15:00,559
Oh, right, yeah. Life of a security guard.

185
00:15:02,698 --> 00:15:05,758
-What, what?
-No, it's just that you said security guard,

186
00:15:05,868 --> 00:15:07,267
and it's perfectly acceptable...

187
00:15:07,369 --> 00:15:09,064
I'm so sorry if I called you the wrong thing.

188
00:15:09,171 --> 00:15:10,832
No, no, no, no. You did fine, you know?

189
00:15:10,939 --> 00:15:13,169
It's just that there's a huge,
huge controversy

190
00:15:13,308 --> 00:15:14,502
brewing in the industry right now,

191
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:17,134
whether the title should be
Security Guard or Officer.

192
00:15:17,245 --> 00:15:19,372
I'm sure you heard about it.

193
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,744
-I didn't.
-You will. You're gonna.

194
00:15:21,849 --> 00:15:24,579
-But I'm sure I will.
-It's out there.

195
00:15:26,154 --> 00:15:29,123
So, you all set
for the busiest shopping day of the year?

196
00:15:29,223 --> 00:15:33,249
Yeah, right.
And the worst day for a birthday.

197
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,818
This year, it falls on a Black Friday, which
means I probably won't even get a card.

198
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,091
Everyone's too busy shopping.

199
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,392
You know what? Yeah. Autumn Ash.

200
00:15:42,502 --> 00:15:43,799
-Yeah.
-I think that's your color.

201
00:15:43,904 --> 00:15:46,498
-I think this'll work.
-It's a winner.

202
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,035
-So that's $9.95.
-$9.95?

203
00:15:50,142 --> 00:15:51,666
-Yeah.
-Wow.

204
00:15:51,777 --> 00:15:54,974
At those prices,
now you got me thinking ponytail.

205
00:15:55,981 --> 00:15:57,778
All right. Thank you.

206
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,781
Thank you.

207
00:16:00,819 --> 00:16:03,413
-Right. So there you go.
-Okay.

208
00:16:03,522 --> 00:16:04,613
And, there you go.

209
00:16:06,391 --> 00:16:08,154
Thank you, Amy.

210
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,124
Thank you, Officer Blart.

211
00:16:10,862 --> 00:16:14,855
Hey, Blart. Wow, nice shirt.

212
00:16:14,966 --> 00:16:16,866
You went with a medium?

213
00:16:17,535 --> 00:16:19,025
It's a bit formfitting,

214
00:16:19,137 --> 00:16:21,604
but that's 'cause we're required to wear
protective vests under our...

215
00:16:21,705 --> 00:16:23,332
No. Not buying it. No.

216
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,465
'Cause I don't see any vest
underneath here, so...

217
00:16:25,576 --> 00:16:28,101
No, but it's a thick T-shirt.
Basically like a thermal they have you wear.

218
00:16:28,212 --> 00:16:30,442
Nope. Nope. No.

219
00:16:31,882 --> 00:16:34,544
I don't understand why you're laughing.
I just called you fat.

220
00:16:34,651 --> 00:16:36,243
I'm not laughing.

221
00:16:40,256 --> 00:16:42,156
Yeah, whatever. Amy.

222
00:16:42,258 --> 00:16:45,318
Hey, everyone's going to American Joe's
tonight, and I want to see you there.

223
00:16:45,428 --> 00:16:47,623
Okay?
We're gonna split some onion strings.

224
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,595
Wow. Wow.

225
00:16:50,299 --> 00:16:51,357
Good.

226
00:16:52,468 --> 00:16:53,764
Good hang.

227
00:16:54,836 --> 00:16:57,464
Wow, yeah. That's great.

228
00:16:57,939 --> 00:17:01,340
Hey, Blart, they need you
at Victoria's Secret.

229
00:17:02,944 --> 00:17:04,536
Okay, roger that.

230
00:17:07,682 --> 00:17:10,172
Okay, I gotta go.

231
00:17:10,284 --> 00:17:11,808
Okay. Bye.

232
00:17:22,162 --> 00:17:23,789
-I found it first.
-No, you didn't.

233
00:17:23,897 --> 00:17:26,160
Ladies. Problem.

234
00:17:26,266 --> 00:17:27,893
What's the genesis?

235
00:17:28,001 --> 00:17:31,164
She's trying to take
the last push-up bra in this size.

236
00:17:31,271 --> 00:17:34,001
There's gonna be a new shipment tomorrow.
They'll be here by noon.

237
00:17:34,107 --> 00:17:35,938
Well, I need this one now.
I have a date tonight.

238
00:17:36,042 --> 00:17:38,033
Really? Is he blind?

239
00:17:39,612 --> 00:17:41,944
Whoa!
Waterproof shoes and Baggies on the socks.

240
00:17:42,048 --> 00:17:43,275
Not my first rodeo.

241
00:17:43,382 --> 00:17:45,873
Okay, ladies, need to see some lD.

242
00:17:45,984 --> 00:17:47,451
No, you don't.

243
00:17:49,688 --> 00:17:53,283
Ma'am, I should warn you, I do have
the authority to make a citizen's arrest.

244
00:17:53,392 --> 00:17:55,326
So does anyone.
I could arrest you right now.

245
00:17:55,427 --> 00:17:58,987
-That's true. She could.
-Hey, not talking to you. Okay?

246
00:18:00,598 --> 00:18:03,362
Can I see you for a second, please, ma'am?

247
00:18:12,276 --> 00:18:16,644
Look, I understand your sensitivity.

248
00:18:16,746 --> 00:18:19,681
I've had some issues with weight myself.

249
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:23,948
-Are you calling me fat?
-No. No, no, no, no.

250
00:18:24,054 --> 00:18:25,646
I'm just saying I've been down that road.

251
00:18:25,755 --> 00:18:30,089
I mean... I mean, I'm still on it.
We both are, you know? Stranded.

252
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:33,719
Let's face it, we eat to fill a void, right?

253
00:18:33,829 --> 00:18:37,162
But as soon as I started eating healthier,

254
00:18:37,266 --> 00:18:39,461
I noticed I wasn't so moody.

255
00:18:39,568 --> 00:18:42,128
And PS, your skin's gonna clear up.

256
00:18:43,672 --> 00:18:45,731
-Can you hold onto these?
-Sure.

257
00:18:48,843 --> 00:18:49,969
Ma'am.

258
00:19:02,423 --> 00:19:03,548
You...

259
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:08,923
She's got tremendous upper body strength.

260
00:19:10,364 --> 00:19:12,594
Backup! Backup!

261
00:19:13,233 --> 00:19:16,134
She's biting my neck. She's biting my neck.

262
00:19:17,204 --> 00:19:18,364
Backup!

263
00:19:22,441 --> 00:19:24,841
Backup! Backup!

264
00:19:29,348 --> 00:19:31,179
Look, I know you're new here and all,

265
00:19:31,283 --> 00:19:34,844
but "backup" seems like
a pretty universal term.

266
00:20:48,322 --> 00:20:50,688
Hey. Can I give you a lift?

267
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,122
What, on that?

268
00:20:52,226 --> 00:20:54,421
With an inexperienced driver
I would recommend no,

269
00:20:54,528 --> 00:20:57,587
but with me,
you'll be as safe as the President.

270
00:20:59,065 --> 00:21:02,557
I don't know. Couldn't that get you fired?

271
00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:04,193
Yes, it could.

272
00:21:06,639 --> 00:21:07,697
Okay.

273
00:21:18,884 --> 00:21:21,216
-ls this all right?
-Absolutely.

274
00:22:23,878 --> 00:22:28,247
And here you go. Safe and sound.

275
00:22:30,818 --> 00:22:33,309
-'65 Mustang.
-Yeah.

276
00:22:33,421 --> 00:22:37,322
Fun fact for you, a lot of people think
the Mustang was named after the horse.

277
00:22:37,424 --> 00:22:40,086
It was actually named after
the P-51 Mustang.

278
00:22:42,396 --> 00:22:45,024
-That's a plane.
-I didn't know that.

279
00:22:47,234 --> 00:22:49,725
Well, thank you for the ride, Paul.
That was so much fun.

280
00:22:49,836 --> 00:22:51,166
No problem.

281
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:56,468
Listen,

282
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:00,570
if you ever, you know, need rides anywhere,

283
00:23:01,581 --> 00:23:04,106
Dispatch, they can get me. You know.

284
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,946
-Or we could just text each other.
-Yeah.

285
00:23:07,752 --> 00:23:10,243
-Yeah, give me your cell phone.
-My cell?

286
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:12,755
Yeah, and I'll punch my number in.

287
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:18,358
Left it in the casuals. You know what?

288
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:20,488
Just give me your number
and I'll remember it.

289
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:22,965
-Okay. Ready?
-Yep.

290
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,535
-All right. 555...
-Not yet. Just...

291
00:23:26,203 --> 00:23:27,261
Now I'm ready.

292
00:23:27,371 --> 00:23:28,895
-555...
-555...

293
00:23:29,006 --> 00:23:30,200
-...01...
-...01...

294
00:23:30,307 --> 00:23:31,774
-...78.
-Eight. Got it.

295
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:33,001
That's it. It's locked.

296
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:36,375
Great, so I'll see you tonight
at American Joe's, right?

297
00:23:36,981 --> 00:23:39,347
Yeah, I mean, everybody's going, so...

298
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,246
-Yeah.
-...why not me, too? I'll be...

299
00:23:41,351 --> 00:23:42,443
Yeah, I'm there.

300
00:23:42,552 --> 00:23:44,816
-Great. Bye.
-Okay. Bye.

301
00:24:49,581 --> 00:24:51,674
-Hey.
-Hey! Hey. Glad you made it, Paul.

302
00:24:51,784 --> 00:24:53,342
Good to be here.

303
00:24:53,986 --> 00:24:55,920
-Fun fact for you...
-This place sucks.

304
00:24:56,021 --> 00:24:58,785
-You want to get out of here?
-No.

305
00:24:58,891 --> 00:25:00,552
I'm sorry, what were you saying?

306
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:02,523
No, I was just saying that

307
00:25:02,627 --> 00:25:06,996
the first American Joe's actually opened
its doors in 1972.

308
00:25:07,098 --> 00:25:10,431
And most people,
because of its service and theme,

309
00:25:10,535 --> 00:25:14,596
think that it's derivative of Abe and Louie's,
but it's not.

310
00:25:14,706 --> 00:25:16,537
It's its own thing.

311
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:20,703
You really know a lot of facts, Paul.

312
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:24,645
Hey, Blart, I heard you got your ass handed
to you by a fat chick at Victoria's Secret.

313
00:25:24,748 --> 00:25:26,613
Well, I don't hit women,

314
00:25:26,717 --> 00:25:30,175
-so I don't even know what...
-Yeah. Just minivans, right?

315
00:25:31,521 --> 00:25:35,889
Hey, why don't you go over to the bar
and grab yourself one of those girly drinks?

316
00:25:35,991 --> 00:25:39,518
-I'll meet you over there.
-Okay. Does anybody else want a drink?

317
00:25:39,628 --> 00:25:41,926
-'Cause Stuart's buying.
-No, no, no. They're good. They're good.

318
00:25:42,031 --> 00:25:44,966
-So... They're good.
-Okay.

319
00:25:49,238 --> 00:25:54,140
Hey, listen, l...
We're basically already together, so...

320
00:25:54,242 --> 00:25:56,107
I wasn't... I didn't even realize that.

321
00:25:56,211 --> 00:25:57,405
-And I was... I wouldn't... Doing anything.
-Yeah.

322
00:25:57,512 --> 00:25:58,877
I just want you to grab a hold of it, tight.

323
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,038
-Okay?
-I got it.

324
00:26:00,148 --> 00:26:03,345
I mean,
it's not like you really had a chance, okay?

325
00:26:03,451 --> 00:26:06,317
Security guard? Really.

326
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,354
But you're a pen salesman, dude.

327
00:26:08,455 --> 00:26:11,686
Yeah, and I just bought a Camry,
so you can eat me.

328
00:26:12,526 --> 00:26:15,154
All right, bro. Back off.
You know, we're all just here having fun.

329
00:26:15,262 --> 00:26:16,627
Okay, bro.

330
00:26:19,833 --> 00:26:20,925
What?

331
00:26:23,736 --> 00:26:26,534
Hey, thanks
for getting my back there, brother.

332
00:26:26,639 --> 00:26:29,836
Security blood runs deep between...
Yeah, let's just go.

333
00:26:33,212 --> 00:26:34,941
-Round six.
-Let's do this thing.

334
00:26:35,047 --> 00:26:36,344
-Gentlemen ready?
-No.

335
00:26:36,449 --> 00:26:38,076
Not yet. Now I'm ready. Okay.

336
00:26:38,184 --> 00:26:39,844
And, go!

337
00:26:45,223 --> 00:26:47,418
Leon, I can't give you the Heimlich,
so you better chew.

338
00:26:47,526 --> 00:26:48,686
I know.

339
00:26:49,494 --> 00:26:51,894
Told you, boy. You better hurry up.

340
00:26:51,997 --> 00:26:53,430
There you go. Nachos in my face.

341
00:26:53,532 --> 00:26:56,591
Oh, my God. These peppers.
The peppers are hot.

342
00:26:58,269 --> 00:27:00,794
Oh, my God. Oh, that's a hot pepper.

343
00:27:01,672 --> 00:27:03,435
Nachos are good, man.

344
00:27:04,575 --> 00:27:08,341
Better inform all your friends, boy.
Nachos about to be gone.

345
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,579
You're lagging behind.

346
00:27:12,182 --> 00:27:14,150
Come on, Paul. Playing games.

347
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:19,812
I love these nachos, I'll tell you that much.

348
00:27:21,758 --> 00:27:23,783
-That lemonade is insane.
-Yeah, Paul.

349
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:27,351
-That's because it's a margarita.
-No. I don't drink.

350
00:28:01,294 --> 00:28:02,921
Twist it.

351
00:28:03,563 --> 00:28:05,497
Feel the nub.

352
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,828
-Hey, you want some? Here.
-Yeah.

353
00:28:12,806 --> 00:28:14,296
You want fruit?

354
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,818
Bye! You blinked! You blinked.

355
00:28:32,524 --> 00:28:35,617
Time to pluck the grape from the vine.

356
00:28:37,128 --> 00:28:41,462
Still got the Baggies! Hot jiggity.

357
00:28:43,468 --> 00:28:45,197
Coming on the left.

358
00:28:48,072 --> 00:28:49,436
False alarm.

359
00:28:56,613 --> 00:28:58,911
Told my mom everything about us.

360
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:02,043
What are you talking about?

361
00:29:03,954 --> 00:29:07,389
You're acting coy. Come on. It's natural.

362
00:29:08,057 --> 00:29:10,491
You know. You so know.

363
00:29:10,593 --> 00:29:13,187
No, I'm sorry, Paul. I don't know.

364
00:29:15,464 --> 00:29:18,365
Snap. Pop goes the weasel.

365
00:29:20,836 --> 00:29:22,632
So happy!

366
00:29:23,872 --> 00:29:24,930
Yeah!

367
00:29:48,462 --> 00:29:49,588
Yeah!

368
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,935
I believe in magic!

369
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:01,063
No way!

370
00:30:08,114 --> 00:30:10,604
I'm sorry it didn't work out, dear.

371
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,274
It's fine, Ma.

372
00:30:13,385 --> 00:30:16,411
-Hey, Dad, why don't we check for matches?
-Yes.

373
00:30:16,521 --> 00:30:20,651
Yeah, I don't think so, sweetheart.
I think I'm just gonna turn in.

374
00:30:21,727 --> 00:30:26,130
Well, how about something special
for lunch tomorrow to cheer you up?

375
00:30:26,231 --> 00:30:29,063
I don't think so, Ma. It's fine.

376
00:30:35,539 --> 00:30:37,973
If something's gonna work,
it would be the sloppy joe.

377
00:30:38,075 --> 00:30:41,135
But that would probably... You know.

378
00:30:44,948 --> 00:30:47,508
You know, if you're doing the sloppy joe,
do the sweet potato fries.

379
00:30:47,617 --> 00:30:50,586
But it... Whatever, you know.
Well done. Yeah.

380
00:32:24,007 --> 00:32:25,736
Maya. Hey.

381
00:32:27,144 --> 00:32:30,113
Dad. I'm so sorry.

382
00:32:34,017 --> 00:32:35,314
It's okay.

383
00:32:36,686 --> 00:32:38,984
There are other fish in the sea.

384
00:32:39,088 --> 00:32:41,613
You just gotta keep looking.

385
00:32:41,724 --> 00:32:43,954
And it doesn't matter what you do.

386
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:47,996
Because once someone takes the time
to get to know the real you,

387
00:32:48,097 --> 00:32:49,689
all bets are off.

388
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:58,239
If it doesn't work out, you'll always have us.

389
00:33:00,275 --> 00:33:04,439
I'm sorry, sweetie, I popped my ears.
I didn't hear a word you were saying.

390
00:33:04,546 --> 00:33:06,514
You just have to...

391
00:33:06,615 --> 00:33:08,207
Is that a tattoo?

392
00:33:10,384 --> 00:33:12,443
I... Yeah, yeah, it is.

393
00:33:13,387 --> 00:33:15,480
When did you get it?

394
00:33:15,589 --> 00:33:18,114
-I got it last night.
-What is it?

395
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,226
It's the Loch Ness monster.

396
00:33:22,329 --> 00:33:23,796
I don't drink.

397
00:33:59,931 --> 00:34:02,593
-Hey.
-Hi.

398
00:34:03,935 --> 00:34:05,197
That was

399
00:34:06,204 --> 00:34:08,365
a little weird the other night, huh?

400
00:34:08,472 --> 00:34:11,100
Yeah, you know, it had its moments. Yeah.

401
00:34:11,209 --> 00:34:14,871
Was one of them
when I tried to make out with your purse?

402
00:34:14,978 --> 00:34:17,640
You see, alcohol instantly turns to sugar
in the blood.

403
00:34:17,747 --> 00:34:20,341
And what happens is the capillaries...

404
00:34:24,621 --> 00:34:27,988
Yeah, look. A lot of people...

405
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:33,886
Pretty much everybody, you know, tends
to write me off.

406
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:37,598
And if you did, too, believe me, I get it.

407
00:34:39,134 --> 00:34:43,230
I just...
I guess what I'm asking is that you don't.

408
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:49,199
Okay. You know, I'm sorry, I've just...

409
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:51,175
I've gotta cash my paycheck
before the bank closes. I'm...

410
00:34:51,279 --> 00:34:52,644
No problem.
Maybe we could talk later or something?

411
00:34:52,747 --> 00:34:54,442
-Yeah, sure. You could just text me, or...
-Okay.

412
00:34:54,549 --> 00:34:57,040
-Yeah.
-I can do that. I can do that.

413
00:34:59,921 --> 00:35:02,549
You know, Paul, everybody texts these days.

414
00:35:02,657 --> 00:35:04,783
I can't believe you don't have a cell phone.

415
00:35:04,891 --> 00:35:06,916
I'm not about all this technology, Vijay.

416
00:35:07,027 --> 00:35:11,123
I prefer face-to-face interaction
or a nice handwritten sentiment.

417
00:35:12,165 --> 00:35:13,530
300 bucks?

418
00:35:13,634 --> 00:35:18,333
I dug myself into a really deep hole
with this girl, you gotta help me. Please.

419
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,076
Paul, you've always been a straight shooter,
so I'll tell you what.

420
00:35:24,176 --> 00:35:26,940
Why don't you take my daughter
Parisa's phone?

421
00:35:27,046 --> 00:35:29,344
-No, I can't do that.
-No, no, no, no, no, no.

422
00:35:29,448 --> 00:35:30,608
I'm punishing her.

423
00:35:30,716 --> 00:35:34,311
No. What with all the parties
and that ex-boyfriend Pahud,

424
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,182
she went over her minutes.

425
00:35:36,288 --> 00:35:39,917
When and if she decides to turn
her life around, I'll simply take it back.

426
00:35:40,025 --> 00:35:41,890
Until then, you use it.

427
00:35:43,995 --> 00:35:45,485
-Thanks.
-Sure.

428
00:35:45,597 --> 00:35:48,031
-Stay within the minutes.
-Of course.

429
00:35:49,868 --> 00:35:52,768
Hey. It's too late to go in that way, guys.
It's closed.

430
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:55,668
-No one's going in there.
-Yeah. I think we are.

431
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:08,508
Hey, yo, Paul. Come here, man.

432
00:36:09,986 --> 00:36:13,581
Look, I know you been feeling down,
so I got this for you.

433
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:16,854
"The Devil's Crotch."

434
00:36:18,061 --> 00:36:19,995
Feel the burn, baby.

435
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:22,587
-Thanks, Leon.
-Get back at me, man.

436
00:36:27,903 --> 00:36:30,098
-Loading dock's ready.
-Got it.

437
00:36:37,312 --> 00:36:38,370
Yeah.

438
00:36:47,688 --> 00:36:49,747
You need a pen, don't you?

439
00:36:49,857 --> 00:36:50,915
You know what? No, I'm good.

440
00:36:51,025 --> 00:36:52,754
-I'll just use one of their pens.
-Yeah, you do.

441
00:36:53,894 --> 00:36:57,329
Yes. The Summit 5280 fountain.

442
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:59,625
-That's stunning.
-Yeah, I know.

443
00:36:59,733 --> 00:37:03,169
How would you like to sign your name
with this panther?

444
00:37:03,269 --> 00:37:04,566
You know what? More than anything.

445
00:37:04,671 --> 00:37:06,468
-Yeah, that'd be great.
-Here. Yeah.

446
00:37:06,573 --> 00:37:08,438
It's yours. I insist.

447
00:37:09,409 --> 00:37:11,001
Oh, hey, guys.

448
00:37:11,111 --> 00:37:12,169
-Hey.
-Hey.

449
00:37:12,278 --> 00:37:14,211
-Hey.
-Don't you just love Fridays?

450
00:37:14,313 --> 00:37:15,940
-Yeah.
-Best night of the week.

451
00:37:16,048 --> 00:37:17,072
Yeah.

452
00:37:18,016 --> 00:37:20,211
-Excuse me. Sorry.
-Hey.

453
00:37:20,319 --> 00:37:22,685
Paul. Paul, can you help me out?

454
00:37:22,788 --> 00:37:24,483
I need to shoot over to the bank
for a minute.

455
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:26,421
There's a few kids inside,
just finishing up their games.

456
00:37:26,525 --> 00:37:29,050
Could you close up the arcade for me?

457
00:37:29,161 --> 00:37:31,253
-Yeah, sure. No problem, Mr. Ferguson.
-Okay.

458
00:37:31,362 --> 00:37:33,830
-You okay? You seem a little down.
-Yeah, I'm fine.

459
00:37:33,931 --> 00:37:35,831
You know, video game might
cheer you right up.

460
00:37:35,933 --> 00:37:37,491
Nah, I'm on duty.

461
00:38:11,467 --> 00:38:13,492
Welcome to the games!

462
00:38:16,205 --> 00:38:17,297
Get set.

463
00:38:18,406 --> 00:38:19,373
Go.

464
00:38:22,644 --> 00:38:24,771
Foul. Foul.

465
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,405
Foul. Foul.

466
00:38:28,016 --> 00:38:30,246
Foul. Foul.

467
00:38:30,552 --> 00:38:33,783
Foul. Foul. Foul. Foul.

468
00:38:34,855 --> 00:38:35,947
Game over.

469
00:38:40,928 --> 00:38:42,361
We are ready.

470
00:39:11,156 --> 00:39:12,623
Let's do this.

471
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,732
Attention shoppers.

472
00:39:23,834 --> 00:39:25,529
Please make your way to the nearest exits.

473
00:39:25,636 --> 00:39:27,797
Unfortunately, the mall will be closing early.

474
00:39:29,507 --> 00:39:33,034
-Everybody out!
-Everybody out!

475
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,539
Everybody out, now!

476
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,578
You, too!

477
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,962
Hi. Hey! Hey! You got me...

478
00:40:11,647 --> 00:40:14,012
I'm at the West Orange Pavilion Mall.

479
00:40:17,385 --> 00:40:20,684
Hey, yo. Hey, there's some crazy-ass people
trying to take over the mall.

480
00:40:20,788 --> 00:40:23,484
-I'm out of here.
-Everybody on the floor!

481
00:40:33,633 --> 00:40:36,261
Tell them to bring SWAT.
There may be hostages.

482
00:40:47,246 --> 00:40:49,407
What are you doing? Get down.

483
00:40:53,552 --> 00:40:54,576
Oh, my God.

484
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:03,423
Surprised? I know.

485
00:41:03,528 --> 00:41:05,689
But here's the craziest part.

486
00:41:07,432 --> 00:41:08,956
I'm the leader.

487
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:20,835
Reports are, they're inside the bank
and they got hostages.

488
00:41:20,944 --> 00:41:24,311
This is Sergeant Howard. I need four units
around the back to secure the perimeter.

489
00:41:24,414 --> 00:41:27,247
See if we can establish visual.
Report back to me immediately.

490
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:28,648
Let's get all these civilians out of here.

491
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:30,549
See if we can gain access
into the loading dock.

492
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,383
-Go.
-I'm on it. 94, move 'em out.

493
00:41:46,168 --> 00:41:47,135
Hello?

494
00:41:48,237 --> 00:41:49,601
Feeling alive?

495
00:41:50,505 --> 00:41:51,597
I'm sorry?

496
00:41:54,376 --> 00:41:55,536
Parisa.

497
00:41:56,845 --> 00:42:00,576
She makes you feel alive, doesn't she?

498
00:42:02,183 --> 00:42:06,084
This must be Pahud.
Pahud, no, I'm not with Parisa.

499
00:42:06,553 --> 00:42:08,282
My name's Paul Blart.

500
00:42:08,622 --> 00:42:11,921
Parisa's dad took her cell phone away,
and he lent it to me.

501
00:42:12,026 --> 00:42:16,122
Do not lie to me, Paul Blart.
Do not lie to me.

502
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:19,165
You are probably
sweating over her right now.

503
00:42:19,266 --> 00:42:20,699
I'm not lying.

504
00:42:20,868 --> 00:42:23,631
I mean, I am sweaty,
but I'm not sweating over anyone.

505
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:29,403
That woman is like an angelic goddess
who only brings goodness to this world.

506
00:42:32,311 --> 00:42:35,041
Plus, she has some crazy sexy feet.

507
00:42:39,451 --> 00:42:45,447
Paul, the pain of this breakup
is far too much for me to bear, man.

508
00:42:45,557 --> 00:42:48,219
Pahud, no one can blame you
for being upset.

509
00:42:48,326 --> 00:42:51,762
I mean, the holidays are tough enough
without adding heartbreak to the mix.

510
00:42:52,698 --> 00:42:56,463
Wow. Them's some heavy words, Paul Blart.

511
00:42:57,168 --> 00:42:59,534
Hey, life is heavy.

512
00:43:00,671 --> 00:43:04,869
Indeed. Now, you are at the mall, huh?

513
00:43:04,975 --> 00:43:08,240
So why do you not head over
to Orange Julius,

514
00:43:08,345 --> 00:43:10,676
call up my friend Sameer Oh?

515
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:14,147
Tell him you are now my homeboy.
He will hook you up.

516
00:43:15,852 --> 00:43:17,319
Wait a second.
How'd you know I was at the mall?

517
00:43:17,821 --> 00:43:21,086
I track Parisa's phone with GPS.
Don't you judge me.

518
00:43:26,429 --> 00:43:28,225
Closing time already.

519
00:43:31,767 --> 00:43:36,261
Okay, there are 223 stores in this mall.

520
00:43:36,371 --> 00:43:40,467
Here is a list of the 15 that I need you to hit.

521
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:42,134
And 15 for you.

522
00:43:44,879 --> 00:43:45,971
Okay.

523
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:50,176
Now this is the key to retrieve the codes
from each store's credit-card machine.

524
00:43:50,284 --> 00:43:52,275
They change every day, so make sure

525
00:43:52,386 --> 00:43:56,322
that you bring me back the codes
for today, Friday.

526
00:44:18,244 --> 00:44:21,213
Veck, six guys in standard formation,
just like you said.

527
00:44:21,313 --> 00:44:22,302
Perfect.

528
00:44:24,817 --> 00:44:27,251
Bomb! Bomb! Bomb! Bomb!

529
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:30,516
And these little piggies went
all the way home.

530
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:32,613
Do it.

531
00:44:43,301 --> 00:44:46,532
Gary usually delivers the leftovers
to the Mission.

532
00:44:49,339 --> 00:44:51,466
Hey, everyone. A couple requests.

533
00:44:51,575 --> 00:44:54,043
Kindly tie up the person beside you,
keep your mouths shut,

534
00:44:54,144 --> 00:44:59,081
give up your cell phones,
and as a general rule, do as I say.

535
00:44:59,183 --> 00:45:01,777
You do all these things...
Well, you'll be back at home in no time.

536
00:45:01,885 --> 00:45:03,944
Back to your mediocre lives.

537
00:45:04,854 --> 00:45:07,414
-I don't have one.
-Amy.

538
00:45:12,528 --> 00:45:17,693
I was hoping that you and I could have
a whole Bonnie-and-Clyde thing going on.

539
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,530
You know, minus dying
in a hail of gunfire, of course.

540
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,364
What do you say?

541
00:45:27,309 --> 00:45:28,640
Go to hell.

542
00:45:29,444 --> 00:45:30,502
Ouch.

543
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,540
Hey, Stewie, you don't mind
that I'm hitting on your girlfriend, do you?

544
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:37,947
What? No. She's not my girlfriend.

545
00:45:38,052 --> 00:45:42,386
But I specifically heard you say
that you two were "basically together."

546
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:47,791
No. I didn't say that we were together.
I said that she's into leather.

547
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,264
Have at it. If you...

548
00:45:53,666 --> 00:45:55,429
God, you're an idiot.

549
00:45:57,871 --> 00:45:58,895
Hello?

550
00:45:59,172 --> 00:46:01,231
This is Sergeant Howard
of the West Orange Police Department.

551
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:03,707
-Who am I speaking with?
-Hi.

552
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:05,607
Yeah, well, so here's the deal.

553
00:46:06,279 --> 00:46:09,907
As you learned the hard way,
I have motion sensors by all the doors,

554
00:46:10,015 --> 00:46:11,346
so if you wanna enter my mall,

555
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:15,910
you might as well bring
at least six body bags.

556
00:46:17,055 --> 00:46:18,750
He's drilling the safe,
and they have eyes on us.

557
00:46:18,857 --> 00:46:20,722
See if we can tap into the security cameras.

558
00:46:20,826 --> 00:46:23,056
Now look, no one's gonna try
and enter the mall.

559
00:46:23,161 --> 00:46:25,686
Is there anything you need? Do you need
any food? Do you need any water?

560
00:46:28,232 --> 00:46:31,963
Oh, man. This dude
doesn't deviate from the book at all.

561
00:46:33,337 --> 00:46:36,397
You know, since you're asking,
I would love a Happy Meal,

562
00:46:36,507 --> 00:46:39,101
you know, but...
Make sure the toy is the sea monster,

563
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:40,472
'cause I already have the dragon.

564
00:46:40,578 --> 00:46:43,444
Okay, okay, now what is it you really want?

565
00:46:44,748 --> 00:46:45,942
Silence.

566
00:46:51,922 --> 00:46:54,516
Hey, I'm sorry, mall's closed,

567
00:46:54,624 --> 00:46:58,719
but I can help you find the nearest exit
if you just tell me where you parked.

568
00:46:59,295 --> 00:47:00,626
Sweet mercy.

569
00:47:02,398 --> 00:47:05,026
This is not happening,
this is not happening, this is...

570
00:47:08,737 --> 00:47:12,264
Oh, God. All right, think, Paul, think.

571
00:47:13,008 --> 00:47:15,237
Now what are you trained to do?

572
00:47:19,247 --> 00:47:20,441
Nothing.

573
00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:26,147
Detect, deter, observe, report.
I gotta report it. Reporting it.

574
00:47:27,956 --> 00:47:29,821
Yo, we got a straggler.

575
00:47:32,459 --> 00:47:34,689
-It's a security guard.
-What should we do?

576
00:47:34,795 --> 00:47:38,287
I don't know. Give up, I guess.

577
00:47:38,398 --> 00:47:42,391
Guys, what is wrong with you?
We stick to the plan.

578
00:47:42,502 --> 00:47:45,437
We got a 911 operator connecting us
with some guy named Paul Barth.

579
00:47:45,539 --> 00:47:47,563
He says he's a security officer in the mall.

580
00:47:47,673 --> 00:47:51,006
Hey. Blart? He's one of my guys.

581
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:53,601
Paul, this is Sergeant Howard
of West Orange Police Department.

582
00:47:53,713 --> 00:47:56,273
The mall has been taken over,
and they have hostages.

583
00:47:56,382 --> 00:47:58,373
I need you to exit the building immediately.

584
00:47:58,818 --> 00:48:01,184
We don't need any wild cards
in this situation.

585
00:48:01,287 --> 00:48:03,948
Copy that. Never been a wild card.

586
00:48:04,055 --> 00:48:06,819
Unless you consider the game of Uno wild.

587
00:48:08,026 --> 00:48:12,292
-Blart! Can we focus here, please?
-Yes. Yes, sir. On my way out.

588
00:48:12,397 --> 00:48:15,798
Okay, okay. Come on, don't die. Don't die.

589
00:48:17,035 --> 00:48:18,468
Blart.

590
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:21,032
Don't pee. Don't pee.

591
00:48:30,781 --> 00:48:34,308
Guys, motion detector just went off
at Door 26. Everybody on it.

592
00:48:39,022 --> 00:48:40,046
Amy.

593
00:48:40,156 --> 00:48:42,420
What the hell is he doing? Come on!

594
00:48:42,525 --> 00:48:44,686
-Paul, come on!
-Paulie, come on!

595
00:48:44,794 --> 00:48:45,920
-What's he doing?
-Come on, Blart!

596
00:48:46,029 --> 00:48:47,053
Blart, come on!

597
00:48:47,163 --> 00:48:48,926
-Let's go! Move it!
-Come on! Come on!

598
00:48:49,032 --> 00:48:50,522
-Get out of there!
-Come on!

599
00:48:52,001 --> 00:48:53,558
Is he crying?

600
00:48:53,668 --> 00:48:55,727
-I can't leave her.
-Where's he going?

601
00:48:55,837 --> 00:48:56,929
-Blart!
-Where's he going?

602
00:48:57,039 --> 00:49:00,065
Blart, get back! Will you talk to him, please?

603
00:49:01,209 --> 00:49:03,871
Blart, this is Brooks. What's going on?

604
00:49:04,546 --> 00:49:08,346
Sir, I took a sworn oath to protect this mall
and all inside it.

605
00:49:08,449 --> 00:49:09,882
What oath? We don't have an oath.

606
00:49:10,951 --> 00:49:14,148
I sort of made up my own.
It's on a plaque in my room.

607
00:49:15,089 --> 00:49:17,751
Listen, I think you're making a big mistake.

608
00:49:17,858 --> 00:49:19,450
SWAT's on the way.

609
00:49:19,994 --> 00:49:23,691
And I'm not gonna sugarcoat it,
you're untrained, you're unarmed,

610
00:49:23,798 --> 00:49:26,698
and let's face it, son,
you present a huge target.

611
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,599
With all due respect, sir,
I can't observe and report from the outside.

612
00:49:30,703 --> 00:49:31,692
Over.

613
00:49:31,805 --> 00:49:35,434
Well, Sergeant,
looks like you got your eyes on the inside.

614
00:49:35,975 --> 00:49:40,674
Amy, Paul Blart here.
Are you still in the mall?

615
00:49:41,313 --> 00:49:42,280
Send.

616
00:49:55,427 --> 00:49:56,621
Got him.

617
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:22,976
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

618
00:50:23,086 --> 00:50:25,987
Think. Think. Think, think, think,
think, think, think, think! Think!

619
00:50:48,276 --> 00:50:49,868
Hold it together.

620
00:50:51,946 --> 00:50:53,641
Heart of a warrior.

621
00:51:06,727 --> 00:51:08,217
I missed lunch.

622
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:17,567
Thank you.

623
00:51:24,877 --> 00:51:27,505
This isn't happening, this is not happening.

624
00:51:37,255 --> 00:51:39,553
Hey! Don't make this hard.

625
00:51:45,897 --> 00:51:47,364
You like that?

626
00:52:15,959 --> 00:52:18,757
Brooks, I took out a girl,
but the guy, he ran away.

627
00:52:18,861 --> 00:52:20,988
-Wow, Paul, you got one.
-Yes.

628
00:52:21,097 --> 00:52:24,588
But let the record show,
I did not hit a woman. I just...

629
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:26,565
I put all my weight on her.

630
00:52:27,202 --> 00:52:28,430
Oh, Paul.

631
00:52:29,071 --> 00:52:31,539
No, no, no. She's fine, she's fine.

632
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:33,664
Well, good, let's get you out of there.

633
00:52:34,376 --> 00:52:37,539
No can do, sir.
I am gonna finish what I started.

634
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:40,274
What the heck is this?

635
00:52:40,381 --> 00:52:41,814
Give me that.

636
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:44,242
Paul, this is Sergeant Howard again.

637
00:52:44,352 --> 00:52:47,219
Since you refuse to come out,
I'm gonna need you to go into the bank

638
00:52:47,321 --> 00:52:49,118
and find out
where they're holding the hostages.

639
00:52:50,858 --> 00:52:52,416
With honor, sir.

640
00:52:55,129 --> 00:52:56,561
Good to know.

641
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:30,022
Hey, I haven't heard back
from Donner or Vixen.

642
00:53:30,128 --> 00:53:33,063
Okay. I'm calling an audible here, everyone.

643
00:53:33,164 --> 00:53:37,658
And I need to get this mall locked down
from the inside immediately.

644
00:53:38,536 --> 00:53:41,403
Why don't we just start wasting hostages?
That'll stop them.

645
00:53:41,506 --> 00:53:45,874
Well, that's one way to go, but our hostages
are the only thing keeping the cops outside.

646
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:03,515
I'm Commander Kent. My team is deploying.
I need this location secured.

647
00:54:03,626 --> 00:54:05,184
-We got a three-block perimeter...
-Establish a perimeter

648
00:54:05,294 --> 00:54:06,261
and get all these people out of here.

649
00:54:06,362 --> 00:54:07,590
Whoa, whoa, this is all done already.

650
00:54:07,697 --> 00:54:09,665
My men are gonna do it again, the right way.

651
00:54:09,765 --> 00:54:12,131
Have your guys fall back, now.
Have there been any demands?

652
00:54:12,234 --> 00:54:15,795
-A Happy Meal and absolute silence.
-Well, let's make some noise.

653
00:54:15,905 --> 00:54:19,203
I got snipers at the ready,
communications in check.

654
00:54:19,307 --> 00:54:21,241
Let's tap into security now,
and let's get some visuals.

655
00:54:21,343 --> 00:54:22,742
You can't.
They knocked out the video cameras.

656
00:54:22,844 --> 00:54:28,805
I'll be ready to take on-scene command
in three, two, one. I'm in charge.

657
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:01,513
Brooks, I'm observing the bank now.

658
00:55:02,782 --> 00:55:05,683
They got one assailant
guarding the hostages.

659
00:55:07,886 --> 00:55:09,649
There she is.

660
00:55:09,755 --> 00:55:12,986
My, God. You are my angel pie.

661
00:55:15,927 --> 00:55:18,122
Here come the love sweats.

662
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:21,123
Paul, your radio's still on.

663
00:55:23,634 --> 00:55:24,623
Roger that.

664
00:55:25,102 --> 00:55:29,004
-What's going on? Who is that?
-We got a guy on the inside.

665
00:55:29,106 --> 00:55:31,438
Don't tell me one of your beat cops
is trying to be a hero.

666
00:55:31,542 --> 00:55:36,002
No, he's neither. His name is Blart.
He's one of my security guards.

667
00:55:36,113 --> 00:55:38,377
-Wait a minute. Blart?
-Yeah.

668
00:55:38,482 --> 00:55:39,812
-Paul Blart?
-Yeah.

669
00:55:39,916 --> 00:55:43,682
Are you kidding me? We used to abuse
that loser in high school. Give me that.

670
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:45,480
Blart.

671
00:55:45,588 --> 00:55:48,819
This is Commander James Kent.
New Jersey SWAT.

672
00:55:48,925 --> 00:55:52,019
We went to high school together.
Remember?

673
00:55:52,128 --> 00:55:54,925
I set you on fire at the pancake festival?

674
00:55:55,597 --> 00:55:57,531
Oh, yeah. Hey, Jimmy.

675
00:55:58,100 --> 00:55:59,260
Go Green Hawks.

676
00:56:00,135 --> 00:56:04,128
Yeah, listen. I've got 50 highly trained,
armed professionals out here.

677
00:56:04,239 --> 00:56:06,298
At my command,
we are retaking this location,

678
00:56:06,408 --> 00:56:09,468
and there's no way I'm compromising
this mission so that some mall monitor

679
00:56:09,578 --> 00:56:12,740
who used to eat lunch
with his imaginary friend can screw it up.

680
00:56:12,847 --> 00:56:17,341
Sorry, Jimmy, I had the button pressed.
All I heard was "lunch" and "friend."

681
00:56:17,452 --> 00:56:19,647
Could you do me a favor
and put Chief Brooks back on?

682
00:56:19,754 --> 00:56:20,880
Listen to me, Blart,

683
00:56:20,988 --> 00:56:24,947
you are no longer communicating
with Chief Brooks. Is that clear?

684
00:56:27,094 --> 00:56:28,219
Hello?

685
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:31,424
Hello?

686
00:56:31,531 --> 00:56:34,591
Yeah? Oh, hey, Paul, how you doing?

687
00:56:35,869 --> 00:56:38,861
Well, it looks like they moved the hostages
into the teller area.

688
00:56:38,972 --> 00:56:40,269
I'm gonna get a closer look.

689
00:57:21,879 --> 00:57:22,937
Veck.

690
00:57:25,682 --> 00:57:26,944
There he is!

691
00:57:29,019 --> 00:57:31,283
-Everyone in the back room, now!
-Come on, move, move!

692
00:57:31,388 --> 00:57:32,479
Let's get in the back, huh?

693
00:57:33,756 --> 00:57:38,352
Brooks. I lost visual on the hostages.
I couldn't get them out.

694
00:57:38,461 --> 00:57:41,555
But I know who the leader is. It's Veck.

695
00:57:41,664 --> 00:57:43,894
Veck? The trainee?

696
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,436
-No. The brainee.
-I don't believe this.

697
00:57:48,204 --> 00:57:49,431
I'll pass it on to Howard.

698
00:58:05,553 --> 00:58:06,747
Oh, God.

699
00:58:06,887 --> 00:58:08,752
Trapped is fine by me.

700
00:58:08,856 --> 00:58:11,552
Commence tanning. Three, two, one.

701
00:58:37,583 --> 00:58:38,641
Yeah!

702
00:58:48,527 --> 00:58:49,551
Yes!

703
00:59:04,508 --> 00:59:06,772
Time for some big-game hunting.

704
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:34,025
Open, open, open! Thank God.

705
00:59:39,241 --> 00:59:40,401
Oh, no.

706
00:59:42,610 --> 00:59:47,707
Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! We get it!

707
00:59:53,655 --> 00:59:55,646
Get him! Get him! Get him!

708
01:00:02,429 --> 01:00:03,919
You better run.

709
01:00:07,267 --> 01:00:10,236
-Rudolph, where are you?
-I'm about to end this.

710
01:00:23,582 --> 01:00:26,142
Amy, huh? What a coincidence.

711
01:00:26,252 --> 01:00:28,948
We got a cute little redhead
down at the bank named Amy.

712
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:31,386
-Strawberry blonde, actually.
-Yeah?

713
01:00:31,489 --> 01:00:34,151
Well, I guess I know who I'm killing first.

714
01:00:34,259 --> 01:00:36,819
-Catch you later!
-Yeah?

715
01:00:36,928 --> 01:00:39,158
Well, it looks like you just ran out of mall.

716
01:00:39,264 --> 01:00:42,199
It'll be over quick. She won't feel a thing.

717
01:01:29,578 --> 01:01:33,070
You aren't gonna touch her,
but you are gonna feel this.

718
01:01:38,052 --> 01:01:40,145
Nobody wins with a head butt.

719
01:02:00,006 --> 01:02:01,997
-Give me your cell phone.
-I don't have one.

720
01:02:02,108 --> 01:02:04,201
What are you talking about?
Every kid has a cell phone.

721
01:02:04,310 --> 01:02:06,608
I prefer handwritten sentiments.

722
01:02:08,181 --> 01:02:12,583
Who are these sloppy joes for?
And who gave you this?

723
01:02:12,684 --> 01:02:15,915
They're mine.
I'm late for my shift at Foot Locker.

724
01:02:20,526 --> 01:02:24,189
We're getting the leader on the horn.
He wants to talk to you.

725
01:02:24,296 --> 01:02:25,853
Silence, my ass.

726
01:02:26,998 --> 01:02:28,898
What's the matter?
Throw a few jabs your way,

727
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,764
you curl up in a corner, suck your thumb?

728
01:02:32,737 --> 01:02:34,432
If you don't go toe-to-toe
with that scumbag,

729
01:02:34,539 --> 01:02:36,734
he's gonna roll over on you all night long.

730
01:02:36,841 --> 01:02:38,900
It's all right. That's not my style.

731
01:02:39,010 --> 01:02:45,141
Well, just in case, I wrote down
a couple of clever comebacks, like...

732
01:02:45,248 --> 01:02:46,306
Here.

733
01:02:47,017 --> 01:02:48,678
This is what you been doing?

734
01:02:49,419 --> 01:02:51,580
"Yeah, you and what army?"

735
01:02:53,390 --> 01:02:56,086
-What's wrong with that?
-He has an army.

736
01:03:03,098 --> 01:03:05,999
Everyone deserves a card on their birthday.

737
01:03:30,191 --> 01:03:32,784
So when you and Rudolph
were laughing it up back at the crib

738
01:03:32,893 --> 01:03:35,327
about how easy all this was gonna be,
were you guys like,

739
01:03:35,429 --> 01:03:38,728
"Man, any brain-dead mall cop
that gets in the way is gonna get smoked"?

740
01:03:38,832 --> 01:03:41,494
And then... And then what?
You guys all high-fived?

741
01:03:41,602 --> 01:03:46,096
-Veck, this guard is...
-Winning! I know this, because I am all set!

742
01:03:46,206 --> 01:03:49,470
But sadly, no codes!

743
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:53,909
And I'd say, considering
all the luxury items that I have stacked up

744
01:03:54,013 --> 01:03:59,645
in my Amazon shopping cart,
situation unacceptable!

745
01:03:59,752 --> 01:04:01,743
No, no, no, no, no, no. He looking.

746
01:04:02,488 --> 01:04:03,954
Give me a gun.

747
01:04:06,224 --> 01:04:08,192
Put it down. Put it down.

748
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:10,450
What are you nodding about?

749
01:04:10,562 --> 01:04:14,328
I was just wondering,
were you serious about that Happy Meal?

750
01:04:16,935 --> 01:04:18,766
It isn't coming, is it?

751
01:04:22,406 --> 01:04:23,430
What?

752
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:25,701
This is Commander James Kent,
New Jersey SWAT.

753
01:04:25,809 --> 01:04:27,037
You wanted to speak to me?

754
01:04:27,144 --> 01:04:30,170
I just wanna make sure
that no one does anything stupid.

755
01:04:30,281 --> 01:04:33,307
You should know my men are deployed
and ready to bring this thing to a resolution.

756
01:04:33,417 --> 01:04:35,577
The easy way or the hard way.

757
01:04:35,685 --> 01:04:37,744
That is such a tough call, but...

758
01:04:37,854 --> 01:04:41,449
Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and go with C,
none of the above!

759
01:04:43,426 --> 01:04:45,394
I'm Amy, by the way.

760
01:04:45,495 --> 01:04:48,896
-Amy? From unbeWEAVEable?
-Yeah.

761
01:04:48,998 --> 01:04:52,558
I'm Maya.
My father talked forever about you.

762
01:04:53,302 --> 01:04:57,204
And I gotta say, he really does like you.

763
01:04:57,306 --> 01:04:59,001
I'm gonna throw up.

764
01:05:16,958 --> 01:05:18,289
Oh, that's not so bad.

765
01:05:35,942 --> 01:05:37,273
Oh, my God.

766
01:05:38,945 --> 01:05:40,912
They've got his daughter.

767
01:05:42,014 --> 01:05:43,709
-Dad?
-Maya.

768
01:05:44,483 --> 01:05:47,145
-Everything's gonna be okay.
-How's your blood sugar?

769
01:05:47,252 --> 01:05:50,312
Don't worry about me, okay?
I'm worried about you.

770
01:05:50,422 --> 01:05:54,552
I love you.
All right, now, I'm gonna get you all out.

771
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:57,389
You just hang in there, okay, sweetie?

772
01:05:57,495 --> 01:06:00,259
I will. I'm a Blart, remember?

773
01:06:00,365 --> 01:06:02,299
Yeah. I'll see you soon.

774
01:06:04,569 --> 01:06:07,504
I'm supposed to be on my way
to the Cayman lslands with the hostages.

775
01:06:07,605 --> 01:06:11,097
And where the hell is Rudolph?
He should be back by now.

776
01:07:18,838 --> 01:07:22,296
"lf Veck gets the codes,
he's taking us to Cayman lslands"?

777
01:07:24,077 --> 01:07:27,569
Well, Veck Sims, welcome to the show.

778
01:07:50,302 --> 01:07:51,791
Come and get me, Veck.

779
01:07:51,902 --> 01:07:54,029
I got your codes
for the credit-card machines.

780
01:07:54,138 --> 01:07:58,006
-Yo, you hear that? That's Paul, baby!
-Blart?

781
01:07:59,610 --> 01:08:02,511
That's who's been screwing all this up?
You have got to be kidding me.

782
01:08:02,613 --> 01:08:03,978
Give me a radio.

783
01:08:04,081 --> 01:08:05,742
Let me tell you something.

784
01:08:05,850 --> 01:08:10,445
You take hostages in my mall,
you are making a big mistake.

785
01:08:10,553 --> 01:08:12,544
You seriously undermissed...

786
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:17,859
And you seriously...

787
01:08:19,129 --> 01:08:20,289
Oh, no!

788
01:08:32,841 --> 01:08:34,001
Blart?

789
01:08:39,647 --> 01:08:42,844
Sugar. Sugar.

790
01:08:42,950 --> 01:08:45,612
Blart? You there, Blart?

791
01:08:51,926 --> 01:08:53,860
Hello, Blart. You there?

792
01:09:18,083 --> 01:09:19,414
Hey, Blart!

793
01:09:20,219 --> 01:09:23,279
I was hoping we could get an ETA
of when you're gonna give up.

794
01:09:25,090 --> 01:09:26,717
How about now?

795
01:09:26,825 --> 01:09:30,282
I'll meet you on the corner of Ne and Ver.

796
01:09:30,395 --> 01:09:34,195
Yeah, you heard me. Never!

797
01:09:34,299 --> 01:09:35,789
All right, Dad.

798
01:09:41,005 --> 01:09:44,531
Hey, fellas! You looking for me?

799
01:09:47,978 --> 01:09:50,947
Come on. Come on, come on. Come on.

800
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:58,215
Follow me.

801
01:09:58,322 --> 01:09:59,721
There he is.

802
01:10:03,326 --> 01:10:05,157
We got him trapped in Rainforest Cafe.

803
01:10:05,261 --> 01:10:08,230
Great. Wait for me.
You know, my mom always said,

804
01:10:08,331 --> 01:10:10,561
"lf you want something done right,
waste the guy yourself."

805
01:10:10,666 --> 01:10:13,533
I'm paraphrasing, of course. You stay here.

806
01:10:22,944 --> 01:10:24,809
Prancer, take the back.

807
01:11:32,610 --> 01:11:35,909
Hey, you. Scuba Dooby-Doo.

808
01:11:58,334 --> 01:12:01,701
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Can I have my codes now, please?

809
01:12:01,804 --> 01:12:04,068
Why? No codes, no Cayman lslands?

810
01:12:04,173 --> 01:12:06,038
Looks like Paul Blart turned into
quite the badass.

811
01:12:06,141 --> 01:12:07,733
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Relax.

812
01:12:09,978 --> 01:12:11,035
No.

813
01:12:11,813 --> 01:12:14,839
One thing I know is
Paul Blart is not a badass.

814
01:12:39,306 --> 01:12:42,503
Comet! Don't come back till he's dead!

815
01:12:44,710 --> 01:12:50,273
Brooks. Only one more left.
Then it's just me and Veck.

816
01:12:52,985 --> 01:12:55,180
Okay, who's talking to Blart?

817
01:12:55,988 --> 01:12:58,286
Was it you, sugar mouth?

818
01:12:58,391 --> 01:13:00,950
All right. Let's try this again.

819
01:13:01,059 --> 01:13:02,617
Wait! No, no, no! No, no, no, no, no!

820
01:13:02,727 --> 01:13:05,252
It's her phone, it's hers.
She's talking to him.

821
01:13:05,363 --> 01:13:09,390
She's talking to him, and I told her not to.
And it's under her leg.

822
01:13:09,501 --> 01:13:12,698
The phone. Her right leg. Right there.
That's good.

823
01:13:13,938 --> 01:13:14,996
Okay.

824
01:13:18,642 --> 01:13:20,132
That was close.

825
01:13:20,844 --> 01:13:22,004
He is a pro.

826
01:13:23,614 --> 01:13:25,844
Listen, Blart, time's up. We're busting in.

827
01:13:25,949 --> 01:13:28,747
Wait! Look, Veck's after
the credit-card codes, and I got them.

828
01:13:28,852 --> 01:13:30,410
Just give me a few minutes.

829
01:13:30,521 --> 01:13:31,545
No problem.

830
01:13:53,775 --> 01:13:55,333
Isn't that cute?

831
01:14:16,197 --> 01:14:18,859
-Hey, Amy. I'm on my way.
-Oh, hey, Blart.

832
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:22,727
Wow. Our boy Stuart just turned me on
to your profile

833
01:14:22,836 --> 01:14:24,770
on lonelyloser.com.

834
01:14:26,072 --> 01:14:29,371
"Likes morning rain, walks on the beach."

835
01:14:30,210 --> 01:14:31,973
Who are you, Olivia Newton-John?

836
01:14:32,579 --> 01:14:34,809
I was just speaking from the heart.

837
01:14:34,914 --> 01:14:39,509
Yeah, well, I didn't have to go online, Paul,
to know that you love peanut brittle.

838
01:14:39,618 --> 01:14:40,642
You're so pathetic.

839
01:14:45,290 --> 01:14:46,450
Trippy.

840
01:14:51,597 --> 01:14:53,121
This I can use.

841
01:14:54,665 --> 01:14:55,893
What do you want, Veck?

842
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,264
I just want the $30 million
that I came here for.

843
01:14:58,369 --> 01:15:03,033
But, you know, I would settle offing
your dream girl, or maybe your daughter.

844
01:15:04,509 --> 01:15:06,534
You touch them, I swear I'll end you.

845
01:15:06,644 --> 01:15:08,077
What're you gonna do, Paul?

846
01:15:08,179 --> 01:15:11,511
You gonna pull up with your left hip forward
giving the illusion that you have a gun,

847
01:15:11,615 --> 01:15:13,913
which you and I both know you don't?

848
01:15:15,252 --> 01:15:18,415
-I could.
-You're not gonna do squat.

849
01:15:18,522 --> 01:15:21,753
The next time I see you, Paul,
I'm gonna put a bullet in your head.

850
01:15:21,858 --> 01:15:25,419
I don't think so. I'm taking you down.

851
01:15:43,711 --> 01:15:44,837
Blart!

852
01:15:50,351 --> 01:15:51,648
Oh, Blart.

853
01:15:59,526 --> 01:16:01,756
Sweet mercy.

854
01:16:09,836 --> 01:16:13,067
I wish I had a bat. I would bust you open,
see how much candy fell out.

855
01:16:13,173 --> 01:16:15,003
-Too tight!
-This is not happening.

856
01:16:15,107 --> 01:16:17,268
-It's not happening.
-Come on.

857
01:16:43,134 --> 01:16:46,570
Bravo. That was awesome.

858
01:16:47,938 --> 01:16:52,705
And you were just so close
to making it, too, Paul. Just so close.

859
01:16:52,810 --> 01:16:55,779
-It's not over yet.
-Yeah, I think it is.

860
01:16:55,879 --> 01:17:01,078
Now the only thing I need are my codes,
which, judging from your text messages,

861
01:17:01,185 --> 01:17:05,348
you have been so sweet as to enter them
into your phone just for me.

862
01:17:07,857 --> 01:17:10,655
You think I'm gonna carry the phone
with me that actually contains the...

863
01:17:19,935 --> 01:17:22,301
-Yello?
-Peanut Blart and Jelly.

864
01:17:22,404 --> 01:17:26,841
What's up, man?
So good to hear your voice.

865
01:17:26,942 --> 01:17:28,204
Yeah, it's good to hear
your voice, too, Pahud.

866
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:29,800
Listen, I'm gonna have to call you back.

867
01:17:29,911 --> 01:17:32,675
-What? When?
-I don't know when. I'll talk to you later.

868
01:17:32,781 --> 01:17:35,682
Okay, Paul, call me back!
Call me back, Paul!

869
01:17:38,085 --> 01:17:40,747
I mean,
this just keeps getting better and better.

870
01:17:40,855 --> 01:17:43,790
I mean, you are impossible
to underestimate.

871
01:17:43,891 --> 01:17:45,722
I mean, you can't pass the trooper exam,

872
01:17:45,826 --> 01:17:49,785
you black out if you don't have
a Snickers bar like every 20 minutes,

873
01:17:49,897 --> 01:17:53,559
you had the chance to be the MVP,
and you blew it.

874
01:17:53,667 --> 01:17:56,830
Again, like you always do.
Ain't that right, Maya?

875
01:18:06,212 --> 01:18:09,738
What do you want me to say, Veck?
You're smarter than me.

876
01:18:10,883 --> 01:18:14,649
You're good on computers,
you kept your weight under control.

877
01:18:15,688 --> 01:18:18,452
I mean, people,
they look at me and you, and...

878
01:18:18,557 --> 01:18:20,422
Yeah, it's a landslide.

879
01:18:20,859 --> 01:18:22,417
It's no contest.

880
01:18:24,229 --> 01:18:25,354
Sorry.

881
01:18:26,330 --> 01:18:28,992
Right now, you're the man with the gun.

882
01:18:31,302 --> 01:18:32,792
So here you go.

883
01:18:50,587 --> 01:18:52,054
Come on!

884
01:18:52,155 --> 01:18:53,588
Go get him!

885
01:18:53,690 --> 01:18:54,918
Go, Dad.

886
01:18:56,927 --> 01:18:58,086
What...

887
01:19:02,264 --> 01:19:05,028
Probably should have capitalized on that.

888
01:19:05,735 --> 01:19:06,895
Dad!

889
01:19:12,541 --> 01:19:15,031
Lock and load, boys. We're going in.

890
01:19:22,016 --> 01:19:23,449
Hey, we're on the move.

891
01:19:23,551 --> 01:19:24,779
Let's go.

892
01:19:29,290 --> 01:19:31,257
Come on, come on, come on.

893
01:19:46,072 --> 01:19:48,233
Paul. Think, Paul. Think!

894
01:19:51,177 --> 01:19:55,136
Let's go, men. Take it down.
Secure the suspects.

895
01:20:05,190 --> 01:20:06,418
Get down!

896
01:20:07,492 --> 01:20:09,756
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

897
01:20:13,231 --> 01:20:16,462
Down. The other one. That's the back one.

898
01:20:16,568 --> 01:20:19,968
No, no. That's the same one. No!
The other one!

899
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:22,732
Veck got away with my daughter and Amy.

900
01:20:23,307 --> 01:20:26,640
Entry team, clear the mall. We'll pursue.

901
01:20:27,111 --> 01:20:28,305
Light.

902
01:20:30,948 --> 01:20:32,415
Open the door.

903
01:20:36,319 --> 01:20:37,752
Let's do this.

904
01:20:41,591 --> 01:20:43,855
Jimmy, give me your cell phone.

905
01:20:45,695 --> 01:20:49,825
Gotta hand it to you, Blart.
You're really taking care of business.

906
01:20:51,834 --> 01:20:52,926
What up?

907
01:20:53,035 --> 01:20:55,663
Pahud, do you still have GPS
on Parisa's cell phone?

908
01:20:55,771 --> 01:21:00,071
You know I do, Paul. You know I do.
What can I do for you?

909
01:21:00,175 --> 01:21:01,836
I need to know where it's headed.

910
01:21:05,714 --> 01:21:08,045
Paul, it looks like
they're on their way to McGuire Airfield.

911
01:21:08,149 --> 01:21:10,310
I know where that is. Thanks.

912
01:21:11,485 --> 01:21:12,713
Hang on.

913
01:21:16,290 --> 01:21:17,917
My God. There they are.
Jimmy, take the wheel.

914
01:21:18,025 --> 01:21:19,083
What?

915
01:21:20,862 --> 01:21:22,727
Here we go! Here we go!

916
01:21:23,164 --> 01:21:25,097
That was me. I can't...

917
01:21:43,816 --> 01:21:46,944
Here I go! No!

918
01:21:51,624 --> 01:21:52,750
Blart!

919
01:21:57,295 --> 01:21:59,024
Don't do it! Blart!

920
01:22:15,545 --> 01:22:17,137
Oh, God. Oh, God.

921
01:22:31,894 --> 01:22:33,759
Maya! Maya, get inside.

922
01:22:34,230 --> 01:22:35,788
-Oh, God!
-Dad!

923
01:22:35,898 --> 01:22:36,956
Paul?

924
01:22:49,044 --> 01:22:50,807
I really don't drink.

925
01:22:56,551 --> 01:22:58,917
Come on. Oh, yeah?

926
01:22:59,988 --> 01:23:01,477
-Dad!
-Come on.

927
01:23:05,993 --> 01:23:07,051
Dad!

928
01:23:09,163 --> 01:23:11,256
Man, that hypoglycemia is a killer.

929
01:23:16,236 --> 01:23:18,396
I told you I'd take you down.

930
01:23:22,775 --> 01:23:23,901
Blart!

931
01:23:25,445 --> 01:23:28,414
Very impressive,
taking down an assailant without a gun.

932
01:23:28,514 --> 01:23:30,982
I hope you don't mind if I use one.

933
01:23:31,317 --> 01:23:32,375
What?

934
01:23:36,888 --> 01:23:38,685
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yeah.

935
01:23:39,558 --> 01:23:41,549
I guess
it's off to the Cayman lslands then, huh?

936
01:23:41,660 --> 01:23:43,093
Soon as I get my money.

937
01:23:43,195 --> 01:23:46,824
Yeah, well, you'll be needing this.

938
01:23:46,932 --> 01:23:48,900
Just give it to him, Dad.

939
01:23:49,434 --> 01:23:53,164
Oh, I will. Suck on that!

940
01:23:55,906 --> 01:23:58,534
Okay. Situation update?

941
01:23:59,210 --> 01:24:01,337
We have seven assailants in custody, sir.

942
01:24:01,979 --> 01:24:05,005
-Great. Nobody talks to them but me.
-Yes, sir.

943
01:24:05,116 --> 01:24:07,345
You see, jackass? I don't need the phone.

944
01:24:07,450 --> 01:24:09,475
'Cause I got all the access codes
written on their arm.

945
01:24:09,586 --> 01:24:11,713
Now, I kill you three,
there'll be no witnesses.

946
01:24:11,821 --> 01:24:14,381
And since everybody thinks
this was a bank...

947
01:24:28,404 --> 01:24:33,341
I got a newsflash for you.
Your flight's been canceled.

948
01:24:35,411 --> 01:24:37,811
That's better than anything I got.

949
01:24:45,553 --> 01:24:47,180
You did good, Dad.

950
01:24:48,689 --> 01:24:50,623
Yeah, I am pretty great.

951
01:24:54,328 --> 01:24:57,296
You know, she doesn't need a green card.

952
01:25:39,671 --> 01:25:41,639
I don't know what to say.

953
01:25:42,207 --> 01:25:44,800
I have something I want to say to you.

954
01:25:48,445 --> 01:25:50,174
Happy birthday, Amy.

955
01:26:13,469 --> 01:26:15,266
I heard you applied to be a state trooper.

956
01:26:15,371 --> 01:26:19,033
You say the word,
my department would be proud to have you.

957
01:26:19,574 --> 01:26:23,510
Thank you, sir. But I think
I'm gonna stick with what I do best.

958
01:26:24,246 --> 01:26:27,943
It's protecting the people
of the West Orange Pavilion Mall.
