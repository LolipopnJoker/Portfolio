00:01:22,086 --> 00:01:26,934
Hello New York! I'm Bobby Rydell.
And I'm glad to be here.

2
00:01:29,372 --> 00:01:34,354
Thank you all for coming to see us tonight.
It's Saturday night in the Copa!

3
00:01:34,482 --> 00:01:36,700
We think that we're gonna
have a great time tonight.

4
00:01:36,724 --> 00:01:38,847
We're gonna do our best
to make sure of that.

5
00:01:38,929 --> 00:01:43,175
As always a very special thanks to
Mr. Jules Podell for having us out.

6
00:01:43,538 --> 00:01:45,434
Let's get started.

7
00:02:16,301 --> 00:02:17,886
Hello sweetheart.

8
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,488
Here is my coat.

9
00:02:19,512 --> 00:02:21,327
And you see this here hat?

10
00:02:21,351 --> 00:02:23,614
I want you to guard it with your life.

11
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:27,364
- It was a gift from my mother.
- Yes, Mr. Loscudo.

12
00:02:27,969 --> 00:02:29,458
Yeah. That's for you.

13
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:31,270
Thank you sir.

14
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:32,723
Joey!

15
00:02:32,758 --> 00:02:35,583
- Hey Carmine! How are you pal?
- Good to see you.

16
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:38,215
Oh thank you! That's unnecessary.

17
00:02:38,443 --> 00:02:40,018
Come on! Let's go. On the album.

18
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:42,683
I saw this kid Bobby Rydell
two and a half years

19
00:02:42,707 --> 00:02:45,096
ago in South Philly.
Nobody knew who he was.

20
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,344
They know now.

21
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,214
Hey!

22
00:02:48,238 --> 00:02:49,609
Gimme Loscudo's hat.

23
00:02:49,626 --> 00:02:53,774
- But he said to guard it...
- I know, I heard. Give it to me. A'right?

24
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,821
Tony Lip!

25
00:03:35,018 --> 00:03:36,626
You put your hands
on me, you punk?

26
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,107
Do yourself a favor. Go
home with your friends.

27
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:43,042
You don't tell me where to go! Do you
know who I am?! I'm goin' back in there!

28
00:04:10,295 --> 00:04:15,006
You tell Jules Lipobdell. If I don't get
my hat I'm gonna burn this joint down.

29
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,495
I swear to God it's
gonna turn up.

30
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:21,422
Really? You tell that fat Jew bastard I
don't get my hat I'll burn Copa down!

31
00:04:26,445 --> 00:04:29,153
I'm gonna have to go back
to driving garbage trucks.

32
00:04:29,976 --> 00:04:31,856
Jesus Christ!

33
00:04:32,388 --> 00:04:34,339
Screw those! He's out of his mind.

34
00:04:36,588 --> 00:04:38,225
We earned our money tonight.

35
00:04:38,572 --> 00:04:40,102
Lip, I thought you
were gonna kill that guy.

36
00:04:40,126 --> 00:04:40,835
Yeah!

37
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,350
Better him than me.

38
00:04:44,499 --> 00:04:46,539
So... What are you gonna do
while we're closed?

39
00:04:46,894 --> 00:04:49,906
I don't know. Maybe go work
at my Uncle's pizza joint.

40
00:04:51,574 --> 00:04:54,716
- You?
- I'm gonna drink for 2 months.

41
00:05:00,647 --> 00:05:01,894
Take me home, Lip.

42
00:05:03,897 --> 00:05:04,943
See you Carmine.

43
00:05:04,967 --> 00:05:07,878
- No! You shouldn't. That shouldn't happen.
- I don't wanna be a...

44
00:05:09,795 --> 00:05:10,995
My hat!

45
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:15,328
Heard it was missing,
so I looked into it.

46
00:05:16,003 --> 00:05:19,343
- I wanted to kill that broad.
- No. No. Wasn't her fault.

47
00:05:19,464 --> 00:05:21,929
Who had the balls to clip Joey's hat?

48
00:05:22,251 --> 00:05:25,811
- Don't worry about it, I took care of him.
- Yeah! I hope you gave him some beating.

49
00:05:26,908 --> 00:05:29,944
Here. Take this. Put
it in your kick.

50
00:05:30,323 --> 00:05:33,530
No. No thanks. It was a
pleasure, Mr. Loscudo.

51
00:05:33,831 --> 00:05:35,640
Bullshit! Take it.

52
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:40,247
And from now on, you don't call
me Mr Loscude, ya hear me?

53
00:05:40,271 --> 00:05:42,338
I'm your pal Joey.

54
00:07:06,249 --> 00:07:07,590
Good morning.

55
00:07:08,296 --> 00:07:09,496
Good night!

56
00:07:18,056 --> 00:07:22,688
- Come on, Roger! Hit one out!
- Johnny quite! You're gonna jinx it.

57
00:07:22,712 --> 00:07:25,540
Hey Johnny, think you can
yell a little louder?

58
00:07:25,564 --> 00:07:27,905
- Maris is up.
- Yeah, so am I now.

59
00:07:29,054 --> 00:07:30,734
What the hell are you
guys doing here?

60
00:07:31,612 --> 00:07:34,117
We came over to give Dolores company.

61
00:07:37,104 --> 00:07:38,664
Come on!

62
00:07:58,857 --> 00:08:01,260
Come on Roger! Please!

63
00:08:02,068 --> 00:08:03,909
- I'll walk you out.
- Sure.

64
00:08:04,662 --> 00:08:07,575
When did you get back to
these board games? Come on!

65
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,174
Thank you so much!

66
00:08:19,223 --> 00:08:22,977
We got it!
We got it! Yeah!

67
00:08:31,782 --> 00:08:34,911
Do it again. Let's do it again.
Come on baby!

68
00:08:34,957 --> 00:08:38,063
No! Tony, go get dressed.
We're gonna eat.

69
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:41,076
Alright!

70
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,386
No game seven. No game seven.

71
00:08:54,207 --> 00:08:58,852
From thy bounty through
Christ our Lord, Amen.

72
00:09:00,068 --> 00:09:03,091
And if anyone hears of a job for
Tony, let us know.

73
00:09:03,115 --> 00:09:05,909
- Dolor! Please.
- What?

74
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,755
- What happened? Did you get fired?
- No.

75
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:13,112
No, The Copa's closing for repairs. So he
just needs something for a couple months.

76
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:24,497
All the people he knows, he'll find
something in no time.

77
00:09:24,563 --> 00:09:27,568
Oh. He had a great job at the
sanitation department.

78
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,755
You shouldn't have
punched out the foreman.

79
00:09:30,287 --> 00:09:31,932
He shouldn't have woke me up.

80
00:09:33,412 --> 00:09:34,948
That's Tony.

81
00:09:55,546 --> 00:09:57,695
I'm tellin' you, this is
gonna be the easiest fifty

82
00:09:57,719 --> 00:09:59,817
- bucks you ever gonna made.
- Yeah we'll see.

83
00:10:00,351 --> 00:10:02,575
Hey! There they are.

84
00:10:02,624 --> 00:10:03,824
Hi Johnny.

85
00:10:03,828 --> 00:10:05,555
- Tony!
- Hey Paulie. How you doing?

86
00:10:05,579 --> 00:10:08,142
I'm good. I'm good. So,
Johnny here tells me you ate

87
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:11,293
forty-eight White Castle
burgers all in one sitting.

88
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:13,208
Cheese burgers.

89
00:10:13,305 --> 00:10:15,848
- You tell them Frankie.
- I don't believe you.

90
00:10:16,086 --> 00:10:18,059
What do I care if you believe me?

91
00:10:18,594 --> 00:10:19,577
Hey Gorman.

92
00:10:19,601 --> 00:10:23,568
- What's the record here for Hotdogs?
- Eighteen. Fat Paulie.

93
00:10:23,592 --> 00:10:27,324
- Why wasn't Lip in on that contest?
- What contest? I was hungry.

94
00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:30,932
Bet's simple. Half a C-note.

95
00:10:31,037 --> 00:10:34,237
- Most hotdogs in an hour wins.
- With toppings.

96
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:37,029
What the hell you weigh?

97
00:10:37,153 --> 00:10:40,434
- Two sixty.
- Aaaaay. Your left ass weighs two sixty.

98
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:43,017
May my mother-in-law drop dead
on the spot if I'm lyin'.

99
00:10:46,202 --> 00:10:48,370
- Alright. You're up.
- Good.

100
00:10:50,318 --> 00:10:54,354
Pick it up Lip! The baby
elephant just hit nineteen!

101
00:10:54,693 --> 00:10:57,081
Let's go Lip! Let's go. Come on.

102
00:10:58,573 --> 00:11:05,539
You are embarrassing. You're embarrassing
your son. He's killing you.

103
00:11:12,478 --> 00:11:14,670
- Hey Nicky. You do your homework?
- Yep.

104
00:11:14,752 --> 00:11:15,952
Good.

105
00:11:17,714 --> 00:11:20,652
- Where have you been?
- Gorman's.

106
00:11:20,676 --> 00:11:22,860
I'm making dinner!

107
00:11:24,967 --> 00:11:28,246
Fat Paulie bet me fifty bucks he
could eat more hot dogs than me.

108
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:31,178
He knocked off twenty four.
Guy's an animal.

109
00:11:31,314 --> 00:11:32,658
Are you crazy?

110
00:11:32,682 --> 00:11:34,224
You lost fifty dollars?

111
00:11:34,248 --> 00:11:36,604
Dolores. Please.

112
00:11:38,248 --> 00:11:40,049
I ate twenty six.

113
00:11:44,882 --> 00:11:46,590
You're so lucky.

114
00:11:46,616 --> 00:11:47,879
You know that?

115
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:50,574
Rent is due on Monday.

116
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:57,736
You're gonna get that?

117
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,116
Yeah?

118
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:04,819
Hey Lip. Some guy called over here, a
doctor. He's looking for a driver.

119
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,957
- You interested?
- Yeah.

120
00:12:06,981 --> 00:12:09,642
They're interviewing
guys tomorrow afternoon.

121
00:12:09,789 --> 00:12:12,114
The address is...

122
00:12:12,193 --> 00:12:16,213
Eight eighty one, 7th avenue, two fifteen.

123
00:12:36,471 --> 00:12:37,671
Hey!

124
00:12:37,893 --> 00:12:39,898
- Excuse me.
- We're not open right now. But you're

125
00:12:39,922 --> 00:12:42,086
welcome to buy tickets to
tonight's performance.

126
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,234
Nah. That's not it.

127
00:12:44,258 --> 00:12:48,477
I think I got the wrong address.
But is there a doctor's office in here?

128
00:12:48,547 --> 00:12:50,122
A doctor's office?

129
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,580
- Dr Shirley.

130
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:55,280
You have the correct address. Dr Shirley
lives upstairs, above the hall.

131
00:13:01,468 --> 00:13:03,160
How you doing?

132
00:13:14,013 --> 00:13:17,646
I'm here for the driver job.
Tony Lip.

133
00:13:19,587 --> 00:13:21,686
No Tony Lip.

134
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,665
No it should be on there.

135
00:13:26,488 --> 00:13:28,434
No... Um...

136
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:32,643
- I have a Tony Val... Valle...
- Vallelonga. Yeah, that's me.

137
00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:37,258
- Fill it out while you wait.
- What?

138
00:13:37,792 --> 00:13:39,648
Fill it out while you wait.

139
00:14:04,098 --> 00:14:05,689
Have a seat.

140
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:36,211
Mr. Vallelonga, sorry to keep you
waiting.

141
00:14:39,266 --> 00:14:40,794
I'm Dr. Donald Shirley.

142
00:14:41,344 --> 00:14:44,498
- Tony.
- Yes. Please sit down.

143
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,606
Some place you got in here.

144
00:14:51,148 --> 00:14:53,082
Them horns real?

145
00:14:53,328 --> 00:14:55,043
Elephant tusks. Yes.

146
00:14:56,707 --> 00:14:58,180
What about that?

147
00:14:58,183 --> 00:14:59,688
That a molar?

148
00:15:01,261 --> 00:15:03,133
- A what?
- A molar.

149
00:15:03,231 --> 00:15:04,830
Like a Shark tooth?

150
00:15:05,094 --> 00:15:07,195
Tiger's maybe.

151
00:15:07,219 --> 00:15:08,794
It was a gift.

152
00:15:09,457 --> 00:15:12,524
I thought, I thought I
was going to a office.

153
00:15:12,707 --> 00:15:15,298
They said a doctor needed a driver.

154
00:15:15,762 --> 00:15:17,243
That's all they told you?

155
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:20,571
- Yeah.
- Actually, it's a bit more complicated than that.

156
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,934
Have you ever driven
professionally before?

157
00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:29,149
Sanitation. Garbage trucks.

158
00:15:29,848 --> 00:15:33,470
Plus I drive my boss home at night.
But I can drive anything.

159
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,751
Limos, tow trucks.

160
00:15:36,033 --> 00:15:37,665
Snow palms, whatever.

161
00:15:37,689 --> 00:15:40,736
I see. What other
experience do you have?

162
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,666
I worked a lot of joints. The Wagon
Wheel, Peppermint Lounge, Copa

163
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:47,226
- In what capacity?
- What do you mean?

164
00:15:47,979 --> 00:15:50,960
- What did you do there?
- Ah...

165
00:15:52,296 --> 00:15:54,090
Public relations.

166
00:15:55,018 --> 00:15:59,327
Well, first of all, Tony, I'm not a
medical doctor. I'm a musician.

167
00:15:59,586 --> 00:16:02,506
- You mean like songs?
- Yes.

168
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:06,581
I'm about to embark on a concert tour, the
majority of which will be down South.

169
00:16:06,586 --> 00:16:08,887
- Atlantic city?
- No.

170
00:16:09,113 --> 00:16:14,032
The deep south. First we're starting in the
Midwest, but then we're taking a hard left.

171
00:16:14,244 --> 00:16:17,608
Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee,
and on down through the Delta.

172
00:16:17,971 --> 00:16:20,984
Do you foresee any issues in working
for a black man?

173
00:16:21,674 --> 00:16:22,905
No!

174
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,476
No no. Just the other
day me and the wife had

175
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,487
a couple of colored
guys over at the house.

176
00:16:30,569 --> 00:16:32,472
For drinks.

177
00:16:32,983 --> 00:16:35,222
Hmm. I see, you're married.

178
00:16:35,433 --> 00:16:37,844
Yeah. Two kids.

179
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,455
I am not sure this is the proper
job for a married man.

180
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:44,234
Why, we bringing broads?

181
00:16:45,025 --> 00:16:47,410
My point is, you'll be
gone for eight straight

182
00:16:47,434 --> 00:16:49,866
weeks, no breaks, right
up until Christmas.

183
00:16:50,723 --> 00:16:53,259
You're quite sure you can leave
your family for that long?

184
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,714
Depends on what you're paying.

185
00:16:54,738 --> 00:16:57,326
A hundred dollars a week,
plus room and board.

186
00:16:58,015 --> 00:17:02,614
But let me be crystal clear... I'm
not just hiring a chauffeur.

187
00:17:03,052 --> 00:17:07,971
I need someone who can handle my itinerary.
Be a personal assistant. I need a valet.

188
00:17:08,148 --> 00:17:12,497
I need someone who can launder
my clothes, shine my shoes...

189
00:17:14,251 --> 00:17:15,771
Good luck, Doc.

190
00:17:18,781 --> 00:17:20,035
Tony.

191
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:28,447
I had my record label ask around
town to find me the right man.

192
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,174
Your name came up more than once.

193
00:17:32,214 --> 00:17:37,663
You've impressed several people with
your... innate ability to handle trouble.

194
00:17:38,968 --> 00:17:42,371
And that is why I called and
inquired about your availability.

195
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:49,259
OK, here is the deal. I got no
problem being on a road with you.

196
00:17:49,578 --> 00:17:50,958
But I ain't no butler.

197
00:17:51,054 --> 00:17:53,972
I ain't ironing no shirts, and I'm
not polishing nobody's shoes.

198
00:17:53,996 --> 00:17:56,815
You need someone to get you from point
A to point B? You need someone to make

199
00:17:56,839 --> 00:18:00,523
sure there's no problems along the way...
And believe me you in the deep South

200
00:18:00,966 --> 00:18:02,440
there's gonna be problems.

201
00:18:03,326 --> 00:18:06,216
So if you want me, it's a
buck and a quarter a week.

202
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,759
Or go hire the little
Chink that just

203
00:18:07,783 --> 00:18:09,660
pranced out of here,
see how far you get.

204
00:18:12,647 --> 00:18:14,409
Well, Mr. Vallelonga.

205
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:17,578
Thank you for stopping by.

206
00:18:30,487 --> 00:18:31,734
Hey Bobby.

207
00:18:32,186 --> 00:18:33,949
Give me a Rheingold.

208
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:35,771
Ice cold.

209
00:18:44,543 --> 00:18:46,649
Mr Tony.

210
00:18:47,504 --> 00:18:49,173
Augie asking about you.

211
00:18:50,336 --> 00:18:54,942
- Come on, I'm dying of thirst over here!
- Shut up. I'm talking.

212
00:18:58,797 --> 00:19:00,341
- When?
- Now.

213
00:19:00,664 --> 00:19:02,497
He in his box.

214
00:19:28,174 --> 00:19:29,976
Tony Lip.

215
00:19:30,822 --> 00:19:32,647
What the hell happened at
the Copa?

216
00:19:32,826 --> 00:19:34,932
I heard you split a guy's
face open.

217
00:19:36,268 --> 00:19:38,905
That guy you hit. Mickey Charon.

218
00:19:39,004 --> 00:19:41,158
Charlie the Hand's crew.

219
00:19:41,742 --> 00:19:43,458
Guess he shoulda known better.

220
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:50,381
Hand asked me to look into it.

221
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:54,201
I spoke to Podell.
Whole thing was a...

222
00:19:54,204 --> 00:19:56,506
over a piece of ass, right?

223
00:19:56,923 --> 00:19:58,138
Yeah.

224
00:19:58,684 --> 00:20:03,931
Beef like that should never happen
inside the club. They were out of line.

225
00:20:04,733 --> 00:20:06,589
So we squashed it.

226
00:20:08,836 --> 00:20:11,338
You looking to earn a
little extra scharole?

227
00:20:11,362 --> 00:20:13,896
I can keep you busy
while the Copa's down.

228
00:20:14,926 --> 00:20:16,595
What I gotta do?

229
00:20:17,825 --> 00:20:19,321
Things...

230
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:26,908
Appreciate it, but I'm gonna spend
some time with the family.

231
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,263
Don't be stupid. You make
yourself a few extra bucks, buy

232
00:20:30,287 --> 00:20:33,635
something nice for that pretty
little your wife of yours.

233
00:20:38,201 --> 00:20:41,409
Nah, I'm good. I'm
flushed right now.

234
00:20:55,246 --> 00:21:00,415
Here's fifty. Pay me sixty by
New Year, you get it back.

235
00:21:03,045 --> 00:21:07,065
Hey Lip. Everything OK?

236
00:21:07,987 --> 00:21:10,187
What? You got beak trouble Charlie?

237
00:21:10,885 --> 00:21:12,584
Mind your business.

238
00:21:16,298 --> 00:21:20,103
So come on. Dying to hear what
happened with the doctor interview?

239
00:21:20,127 --> 00:21:23,577
He ain't a real doctor, he's a
piano player.

240
00:21:23,963 --> 00:21:27,467
But I don't understand, why'd
they say that he was a doctor?

241
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:31,414
I don't know. I think he's like a
doctor of piano-playing or something.

242
00:21:31,438 --> 00:21:32,985
You can be that?

243
00:21:33,009 --> 00:21:36,592
I guess. He lives on
top of Carnegie Hall.

244
00:21:36,823 --> 00:21:38,962
You shoulda seen this place, Dee.
It was filled

245
00:21:38,986 --> 00:21:41,208
with statues and all
kinds of fancy crap.

246
00:21:41,227 --> 00:21:43,812
And he was sitting on top
of a friggin' throne all

247
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:46,467
dressed up like the king
of the jungle bunnies.

248
00:21:46,918 --> 00:21:48,439
He's colored?

249
00:21:51,492 --> 00:21:55,520
- Then you wouldn't last a week with him.
- For right money, I would.

250
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:07,318
Yeah.

251
00:22:08,485 --> 00:22:09,685
Oh.

252
00:22:10,321 --> 00:22:12,131
Look. Uh...

253
00:22:12,446 --> 00:22:13,928
Really?

254
00:22:15,177 --> 00:22:17,439
OK. OK. Hold on a sec.

255
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,235
It's Dr Shirley.

256
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:22,514
The Piano guy, he
wants to talk to you.

257
00:22:23,322 --> 00:22:25,100
- Me?
- Yeah.

258
00:22:25,103 --> 00:22:26,865
What? No!

259
00:22:27,036 --> 00:22:29,197
Come here. Take it.

260
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,563
Just talk.

261
00:22:34,365 --> 00:22:35,604
Hello.

262
00:22:37,826 --> 00:22:40,924
Good morning, Doctor,
it's nice to talk to you.

263
00:22:46,137 --> 00:22:48,758
Yes, that is a long time...

264
00:22:51,343 --> 00:22:52,808
It is.

265
00:22:55,132 --> 00:22:56,973
Yes. I'm sure.

266
00:22:58,991 --> 00:23:02,175
Thank you for calling...
Bye now.

267
00:23:06,142 --> 00:23:07,412
What did he say?

268
00:23:08,205 --> 00:23:11,079
He wanted to know if I'd
be okay with him taking

269
00:23:11,103 --> 00:23:14,116
my husband away from his
family for two months.

270
00:23:15,698 --> 00:23:17,906
He said he'd pay you
what you asked for.

271
00:23:23,815 --> 00:23:25,030
- Hey!
- Uh huh?

272
00:23:27,229 --> 00:23:28,741
It's good money.

273
00:23:29,081 --> 00:23:30,632
We need it.

274
00:23:33,352 --> 00:23:37,154
I can't be eatin' twenty six
hot dogs every day.

275
00:23:38,949 --> 00:23:40,297
I know.

276
00:23:41,223 --> 00:23:44,173
I told him it was okay
for you to go.

277
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,006
Alright. Hey look. Here's
the first half of your pay.

278
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:51,070
You're gonna get the rest
when the tour's over.

279
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:52,536
- I gotta get paid every week.
- Sorry,

280
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,400
that's not how the
record company does it.

281
00:23:54,661 --> 00:23:57,187
We gotta have some guarantee
you're gonna finish the job.

282
00:23:57,211 --> 00:23:59,979
Why wouldn't I finish the job?
I took it, didn't I?

283
00:24:00,594 --> 00:24:02,817
Well, then we got nothing to worry about.

284
00:24:03,563 --> 00:24:06,193
Here's the deal, Mr. Vallelonga.

285
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,314
OK! It's your job to get
Don to all his tour

286
00:24:08,338 --> 00:24:10,336
dates on time. Now if
he misses any shows,

287
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,867
- you're not getting your back-end.
- He's not gonna miss any show.

288
00:24:12,891 --> 00:24:15,646
Good. Oh, you're gonna need this.

289
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,933
Now this is the book I was
telling you about. Sometimes you

290
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,397
guys are staying in the same
hotel, sometimes you're not.

291
00:24:22,553 --> 00:24:26,471
- Oh yeah, I do...
- Yeah, don't let me down. Let's go.

292
00:24:35,453 --> 00:24:39,215
- Is this the new one?
- Yeah. The record company rented it.

293
00:24:39,351 --> 00:24:41,153
- Nice huh.
- Beautiful.

294
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:44,328
So what my sister have to say about
you being gone for three weeks?

295
00:24:44,352 --> 00:24:46,122
Eight weeks.

296
00:24:46,553 --> 00:24:50,346
Ten-to-one, you slap this moolie
out, you come home in under a month.

297
00:24:52,507 --> 00:24:54,367
- Hi boys.
- Say goodbye to your father.

298
00:24:54,391 --> 00:24:55,872
Frankie, Nicky, come here.

299
00:24:56,726 --> 00:24:58,960
- Hi, will you be good boys?
- Uh huh.

300
00:24:58,984 --> 00:25:00,653
- Listen to your mother?
- Uh huh.

301
00:25:01,112 --> 00:25:04,065
Alright, give me a kiss.
I'm counting on you on this.

302
00:25:05,534 --> 00:25:07,429
- Don't go too far.
- We won't.

303
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:13,976
- Did you go to the A-A-A for the maps?
- Yes, no. I mean

304
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,747
the record company gave me maps and
the itinerary and this thing.

305
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,919
The Negro Motorist Green-Book?

306
00:25:21,943 --> 00:25:25,690
Yeah it lists all places coloreds can
stay down south. Like, you know,

307
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,370
traveling while black.

308
00:25:27,433 --> 00:25:28,816
Traveling while black?

309
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,714
Yeah. If you're black and you
gotta travel for some reason.

310
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:33,316
They had a special book for that?

311
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,808
I guess.

312
00:25:34,832 --> 00:25:36,167
Did you pack the iron?

313
00:25:36,191 --> 00:25:38,800
- I ain't lugging no iron, Dee.
- How're you gonna press your pants?

314
00:25:38,824 --> 00:25:40,501
I'll put 'em under the mattress.

315
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:43,921
I want you to write me a letter

316
00:25:43,924 --> 00:25:46,616
- every chance you get.
- I can't write letters.

317
00:25:46,847 --> 00:25:48,682
- Yes, you can.
- I can't write.

318
00:25:48,706 --> 00:25:50,761
- Take you five minutes. Promise me.
- It's embarrassing.

319
00:25:50,785 --> 00:25:52,018
They ain't gonna be no good.

320
00:25:52,042 --> 00:25:54,586
It's a lot cheaper than calling
long distance, Tony.

321
00:25:55,081 --> 00:25:56,953
Promise me you're gonna write.

322
00:25:57,183 --> 00:25:58,383
I promise.

323
00:26:00,466 --> 00:26:02,924
Here... Put this in the bank today.

324
00:26:02,943 --> 00:26:04,455
It's half my pay.

325
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:08,265
Oh, here is a couple of
sandwiches for you and Dr. Shirley.

326
00:26:08,721 --> 00:26:09,861
Thanks.

327
00:26:09,885 --> 00:26:11,632
- Be careful.
- I will.

328
00:26:12,002 --> 00:26:15,553
- I love you.
- I love you too, baby.

329
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:23,311
You better be home for Christmas or
don't come home at all!

330
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:30,159
I got it pop. I got it.

331
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:59,029
Hey! I'm Tony.

332
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:01,875
The driver.
Bum a smoke?

333
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,897
Thanks.

334
00:27:18,031 --> 00:27:19,555
So, you're with the band?

335
00:27:21,512 --> 00:27:23,368
Oleg. Cello.

336
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:25,348
George. Bass.

337
00:27:25,372 --> 00:27:28,009
And we're not a band,
we're a trio.

338
00:27:28,348 --> 00:27:29,845
Oh, a trio?

339
00:27:30,098 --> 00:27:31,219
Right.

340
00:27:31,243 --> 00:27:34,302
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

341
00:27:58,973 --> 00:28:00,415
Thank you, Amit.

342
00:28:01,796 --> 00:28:03,493
Have a wonderful trip, Sir.

343
00:29:12,188 --> 00:29:15,218
Tony, the first thing I'd like you
to do, when we arrive in the city,

344
00:29:15,242 --> 00:29:19,466
is check the piano where I'm playing, make
sure it's a Steinway as per my contract.

345
00:29:22,589 --> 00:29:26,016
And can you see to it that there is
a bottle of Cutty Sark in my room

346
00:29:26,261 --> 00:29:27,688
every night.

347
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,750
Every night?

348
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:33,906
Well if you ever need
any help with that...

349
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,130
I won't.

350
00:29:37,417 --> 00:29:39,492
Ten-and-two on the
wheel, please.

351
00:29:42,687 --> 00:29:44,019
Hey Doc.

352
00:29:44,296 --> 00:29:46,551
I noticed on the itinerary thing,

353
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,225
last show's on the 23rd December.

354
00:29:49,249 --> 00:29:51,977
- Right?
- Birmingham, yes. It's a Christmas show.

355
00:29:52,001 --> 00:29:54,347
So, any way we could maybe
hit the road early next

356
00:29:54,371 --> 00:29:57,039
morning so we could be home
in time for Christmas Eve?

357
00:29:57,063 --> 00:29:58,458
We'll see.

358
00:29:58,501 --> 00:30:00,224
Appreciate it.

359
00:30:01,501 --> 00:30:03,349
Could you put out the cigarette please?

360
00:30:03,594 --> 00:30:04,865
Why?

361
00:30:05,323 --> 00:30:07,195
I can't breath back here.

362
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:13,785
What are you talking about? Smoke's going
into my lungs. I'm doing all the work here.

363
00:30:13,809 --> 00:30:15,101
Thank you.

364
00:31:07,727 --> 00:31:09,177
What are you looking at?

365
00:31:11,313 --> 00:31:13,903
- You speak German, huh?
- That was Russian.

366
00:31:14,366 --> 00:31:16,959
Yeah, I was stationed in Germany in
the army.

367
00:31:16,983 --> 00:31:19,441
I can pick up a little bit of
what you're saying there.

368
00:31:19,608 --> 00:31:21,878
Watch out for them Krauts.

369
00:31:22,093 --> 00:31:23,824
They're all snakes.

370
00:31:23,944 --> 00:31:26,371
Kennedy shoulda bombed 'em
when he had the chance.

371
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:28,566
Plus now them Cuban bastards.

372
00:31:30,093 --> 00:31:32,574
Ain't they supposed
to be following us?

373
00:31:33,014 --> 00:31:35,315
They have the itinerary. As
long as they get to the show

374
00:31:35,339 --> 00:31:38,239
on time, I am not worried about
it and neither should you.

375
00:31:39,305 --> 00:31:40,990
I ain't worried about nothing.

376
00:31:42,469 --> 00:31:44,977
Fact, when you see me worried, you'll know.

377
00:31:45,001 --> 00:31:47,802
- You'll know if I'm worried.
- Tony. How about some quite time?

378
00:31:49,383 --> 00:31:50,591
Sure.

379
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:56,217
It's amazing you said that.

380
00:31:56,532 --> 00:31:58,467
How about some quite time?

381
00:31:58,955 --> 00:32:00,567
Dolores, my wife, she
used to say that all

382
00:32:00,591 --> 00:32:02,511
time, well not all the
time, but you know...

383
00:32:02,749 --> 00:32:04,431
She says it when I come
off from work some time,

384
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:06,191
you know, she's been with
the kids all that day.

385
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:08,923
And she would say, Tony...
How about some quite time?

386
00:32:08,934 --> 00:32:10,767
Exactly like how you said it.

387
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,345
It means... amazing.

388
00:32:19,483 --> 00:32:20,917
How was that?

389
00:32:22,538 --> 00:32:23,902
Salty.

390
00:32:26,661 --> 00:32:29,228
Have you ever considered
becoming a food critic?

391
00:32:31,806 --> 00:32:34,037
No... Not really.

392
00:32:34,165 --> 00:32:35,629
Why? Is there money in it?

393
00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:40,103
I'm just saying, you have a marvelous
way with words when describing food.

394
00:32:40,973 --> 00:32:42,368
SALTY!

395
00:32:43,112 --> 00:32:45,515
So vivid. One can
almost taste it.

396
00:32:46,643 --> 00:32:48,882
I'm saying it's salty.

397
00:32:48,893 --> 00:32:50,496
And salt's cheating.

398
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,611
Any cook can make things salty.
But to make it taste

399
00:32:52,635 --> 00:32:54,845
good without the salt, with
just the other flavors

400
00:32:54,949 --> 00:32:56,235
that's the trick.

401
00:32:56,575 --> 00:33:00,705
We should really get going soon if we
expect to get to Pittsburgh by dinner.

402
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,637
When I was in the army

403
00:33:03,661 --> 00:33:05,447
I knew a guy from Pittsburgh

404
00:33:05,969 --> 00:33:08,130
except he called it Tits-burgh

405
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,275
he said
all the women there have huge tits.

406
00:33:12,825 --> 00:33:14,174
That's absurd.

407
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:18,472
Why would women in Pittsburgh have larger
breasts than, say, women in New York?

408
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,579
Guess we'll find out, huh?

409
00:33:23,028 --> 00:33:24,806
You know, when you
first hired me

410
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:28,728
my wife went out bought one of your
records, one about the orphans.

411
00:33:29,723 --> 00:33:31,017
Orphans?

412
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:35,406
Yeah. Cover had a bunch of kids
sitting around a campfire?

413
00:33:36,227 --> 00:33:37,857
Orpheus.

414
00:33:39,489 --> 00:33:40,326
Yeah.

415
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:43,057
Orpheus in the Underworld.
It's based on a French Opera.

416
00:33:43,685 --> 00:33:45,830
And those weren't
children on the cover.

417
00:33:46,161 --> 00:33:48,447
Those were demon in the bowels of hell.

418
00:33:49,325 --> 00:33:52,400
No shit. Must have
been naughty kids.

419
00:34:07,575 --> 00:34:10,939
- What are you doing?
- I gotta take a leak. Doc.

420
00:34:11,779 --> 00:34:15,127
- Here? Now?
- You want me to piss my pants?

421
00:35:33,937 --> 00:35:36,723
Oh hey Doc, good afternoon.

422
00:35:37,067 --> 00:35:39,759
Take this for any
incidentals we may need.

423
00:35:40,427 --> 00:35:44,209
If you want to buy something, you don't
have to ask, just keep the receipt please.

424
00:35:44,233 --> 00:35:46,042
When it runs low let me know.

425
00:35:46,381 --> 00:35:47,886
Oh, thanks.

426
00:35:47,905 --> 00:35:49,941
One more thing.

427
00:35:51,032 --> 00:35:55,100
We will be attending many events
before and after the concerts

428
00:35:55,167 --> 00:35:58,922
interacting with some of the wealthiest and
most highly-educated people in the country.

429
00:35:59,509 --> 00:36:01,927
It is my feeling
that your diction

430
00:36:02,171 --> 00:36:05,597
however charming it may be in the
tri-state area, could use some

431
00:36:05,882 --> 00:36:07,173
finessing.

432
00:36:07,197 --> 00:36:10,538
You mean diction,
like in what way?

433
00:36:11,408 --> 00:36:14,162
Like in the only way the word is ever used.

434
00:36:14,879 --> 00:36:15,979
Okay.

435
00:36:16,003 --> 00:36:18,962
Your intonation, inflection,
your choice of words.

436
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:22,038
I got my own problems,
now I gotta worry about

437
00:36:22,062 --> 00:36:24,004
what people think
about the way I talk?

438
00:36:24,028 --> 00:36:27,456
There are simple techniques I can teach you
that are quite effective. I can help you.

439
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,241
I don't need no goddamn help.

440
00:36:29,265 --> 00:36:31,832
People don't like the way I talk,
they can go take a shit.

441
00:36:32,897 --> 00:36:37,201
- The profanity is another issue.
- A fanabla, why you breaking my balls?

442
00:36:37,225 --> 00:36:39,464
Because you can do better. Mr Vallelonga.

443
00:36:39,785 --> 00:36:41,837
Which brings me
to one more point

444
00:36:41,883 --> 00:36:44,711
as the guest of honor, I will
be introduced when entering

445
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:47,614
these intimate events. You
will be introduced as well.

446
00:36:47,923 --> 00:36:50,045
In my humble opinion

447
00:36:50,259 --> 00:36:52,829
Vallelonga may be difficult to
pronounce.

448
00:36:52,853 --> 00:36:55,326
So, I was thinking...

449
00:36:55,357 --> 00:36:58,408
Valle would be more appropriate.
Tony Valle.

450
00:36:58,458 --> 00:37:00,088
Short and sweet.

451
00:37:01,163 --> 00:37:02,395
Nah!

452
00:37:02,796 --> 00:37:05,637
If they got a problem with
Vallelonga, they can call me Tony Lip.

453
00:37:05,642 --> 00:37:09,866
These are genteel people. Tony Lip might
be a little...

454
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:12,163
worldly for them.

455
00:37:12,312 --> 00:37:14,567
Well, then it's Tony Vallelonga.

456
00:37:14,912 --> 00:37:18,500
All these high-class people, so much
smarter than me, with their intelligence

457
00:37:18,524 --> 00:37:22,034
and speaking abilities, you're telling
me they can't pronounce my name?

458
00:37:22,404 --> 00:37:25,564
They don't like it, they can shove it
up their ass, I'll just wait outside.

459
00:37:27,107 --> 00:37:29,260
That sound compromised.

460
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:47,989
Ladies and gentlemen,
tonight we are

461
00:37:48,013 --> 00:37:51,232
privileged to present a
great American artist.

462
00:37:51,828 --> 00:37:55,504
He gave his first public
performance at the age of three.

463
00:37:55,608 --> 00:37:58,989
At age eighteen, at Arthur
Fiedler's invitation, our

464
00:37:59,013 --> 00:38:02,782
guest made his concert
debut with the Boston Pops.

465
00:38:02,897 --> 00:38:08,418
He holds Doctorates in Psychology,
in Music, and in the Liturgical Arts

466
00:38:08,423 --> 00:38:12,530
and he had performed at the White House
twice in the past fourteen months.

467
00:38:12,554 --> 00:38:14,973
He is a true virtuoso.

468
00:38:15,129 --> 00:38:18,829
Virtuoso... that's Italian.

469
00:38:20,074 --> 00:38:22,719
Means he's really good.

470
00:38:23,873 --> 00:38:28,174
So Ladies and gentleman, please
welcome The Don Shirley Trio!

471
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:11,292
Hey, it's your dice, I'm just
having a lucky night.

472
00:40:11,316 --> 00:40:12,516
Tony.

473
00:40:13,918 --> 00:40:15,781
Boss man's calling.

474
00:40:15,805 --> 00:40:18,044
He ain't my boss. I work
for the record company.

475
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:20,156
I work for the record company too.

476
00:40:20,425 --> 00:40:23,432
Come on man! Give us a
chance to win back our loot!

477
00:40:23,456 --> 00:40:25,133
I'm sorry, fellas, duty calls!

478
00:40:25,441 --> 00:40:27,367
Duty calls?

479
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,694
Look man, my duty is
getting my money back.

480
00:40:30,005 --> 00:40:31,506
I've been looking for you.

481
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:34,082
Yeah sorry. The guys were
having a little game.

482
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:37,109
Next time you need extra
money, you just ask me.

483
00:40:37,604 --> 00:40:39,695
More fun winning it.

484
00:40:39,776 --> 00:40:41,460
Then what if you lost?

485
00:40:41,784 --> 00:40:43,932
Craps and cards, I don't lose, Doc.

486
00:40:43,956 --> 00:40:45,398
I don't lose.

487
00:40:46,495 --> 00:40:50,249
So stooping down in the gravel pitching
dice for pocket change makes you a winner?

488
00:40:51,221 --> 00:40:53,796
What are you giving me shit for?
Everybody was doing it.

489
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:56,648
They didn't have a choice
whether to be inside or out.

490
00:40:58,089 --> 00:40:59,398
You did.

491
00:41:02,538 --> 00:41:04,910
And wipe off your knees,
you have dirt on them.

492
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:29,799
Dear Dolores... How are you?
I am fine...

493
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:33,378
I'm eating real
good, hamburgers mostly

494
00:41:33,576 --> 00:41:36,120
so don't worry about me not
eating good.

495
00:41:36,554 --> 00:41:40,332
I saw Dr. Shirley
play the piano. Tonight.

496
00:41:40,742 --> 00:41:45,356
He doesn't play like a colored guy.
He plays like Liberace but better.

497
00:41:46,289 --> 00:41:48,466
He's like a genius I think.

498
00:41:48,514 --> 00:41:50,904
When I look at him in the
rear-view mirror, I can

499
00:41:50,928 --> 00:41:53,599
tell he's always thinking
about stuff in his head.

500
00:41:53,623 --> 00:41:56,163
I guess that's what geniuses do.

501
00:41:56,187 --> 00:41:58,645
But it don't look
fun to be that smart.

502
00:41:59,507 --> 00:42:02,567
I miss you very very much.

503
00:42:11,848 --> 00:42:14,473
- Who is this?
- Who?

504
00:42:14,497 --> 00:42:16,298
On the radio?

505
00:42:16,603 --> 00:42:18,342
Lil' Richard.

506
00:42:18,872 --> 00:42:21,372
Really? That's Little Richard?

507
00:42:21,396 --> 00:42:24,322
Yeah. Think you could
play something like this, Doc?

508
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:28,689
I don't know. Sounds
very complicated.

509
00:42:29,176 --> 00:42:30,978
Ain't that right.

510
00:42:32,117 --> 00:42:34,473
So where did this “Tony
the Lip” moniker come from?

511
00:42:35,873 --> 00:42:37,938
It's not Tony the Lip.

512
00:42:37,962 --> 00:42:40,022
It's Tony Lip.
One word.

513
00:42:40,046 --> 00:42:42,154
I got it when I was a kid.
Because my friends

514
00:42:42,178 --> 00:42:44,754
said I was the best bullshit
artist in the Bronx.

515
00:42:45,728 --> 00:42:48,698
- Why are you smiling?
- What do you mean?

516
00:42:49,537 --> 00:42:51,584
It doesn't bother you
that your friends, the

517
00:42:51,608 --> 00:42:53,808
people closest to you,
consider you a liar?

518
00:42:53,819 --> 00:42:57,208
Who said liar?
I said bullshit artist.

519
00:42:57,232 --> 00:43:01,018
- Then what's the difference?
- Cause I don't lie. Ever.

520
00:43:01,396 --> 00:43:05,534
I'm just good at talking people into, you
know, doing things they don't wanna do.

521
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,245
By bulletin 'em.

522
00:43:07,865 --> 00:43:10,019
And you're proud of that?

523
00:43:10,043 --> 00:43:12,181
Well it got me this job.

524
00:43:17,181 --> 00:43:20,557
Wait a minute. You're full of shit!
You never heard of Chubby Checker?

525
00:43:20,581 --> 00:43:23,840
Of course I've heard of him,
I just never heard his music before.

526
00:43:23,925 --> 00:43:26,367
But I like this. This is nice.

527
00:43:27,422 --> 00:43:30,044
He's got a silky voice...
very smooth.

528
00:43:30,192 --> 00:43:32,256
This is what everybody
is dancing to now.

529
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,854
Eyes on the road Tony.

530
00:43:36,853 --> 00:43:38,499
You know this song?

531
00:43:38,934 --> 00:43:42,603
- I don't think so. No.
- How could you not know this music?

532
00:43:42,673 --> 00:43:44,178
Aretha Frank.

533
00:43:45,087 --> 00:43:47,726
Chubby Checker, Lil' Richard, Sam
Cooke.

534
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:51,207
Come on Doc, these
are your people!

535
00:44:05,078 --> 00:44:08,450
- You want anything? I'm gonna pack smoke.
- No thank you.

536
00:44:42,215 --> 00:44:44,814
Nice turn Mike, what he makes it up?

537
00:44:47,799 --> 00:44:49,655
Snatch an apple Doc.

538
00:44:55,406 --> 00:44:58,035
Before we pull out Tony,
we need to have a talk.

539
00:45:00,278 --> 00:45:02,697
- Yeah?
- Oleg told me what you did.

540
00:45:02,892 --> 00:45:04,207
What I do?

541
00:45:04,231 --> 00:45:06,634
You stole a jade
stone from the store.

542
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:08,695
- No I didn't.
- He watched you do it.

543
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:10,482
I didn't steal no stone.

544
00:45:10,576 --> 00:45:12,558
You picked it up and you
put it in your pocket.

545
00:45:12,582 --> 00:45:15,565
I picked up a rock up off the ground.
I didn't steal from the box.

546
00:45:15,589 --> 00:45:17,608
Now why would you
pick up a rock off the ground?

547
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:19,215
I don't know.

548
00:45:19,957 --> 00:45:22,675
'Cause that ain't stealing.
Just a regular rock.

549
00:45:22,699 --> 00:45:24,860
And why would you
want a regular rock?

550
00:45:25,316 --> 00:45:26,635
To have.

551
00:45:26,659 --> 00:45:28,873
- For luck maybe.
- A lucky rock.

552
00:45:28,897 --> 00:45:31,003
- Yeah.
- Let me see it.

553
00:45:45,491 --> 00:45:47,512
Take it back and pay for it.

554
00:45:49,735 --> 00:45:53,725
I told you that Kraut was a sneak. Rats
me out for something I didn't even do.

555
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:55,769
Pay for the stone, Tony,
you'll feel better.

556
00:45:55,793 --> 00:45:56,837
I feel fine.

557
00:45:56,861 --> 00:46:00,280
And I ain't paying for no
regular rock I found in the dirt.

558
00:46:00,821 --> 00:46:03,354
Do not drive, Mr. Vallelonga.

559
00:46:07,091 --> 00:46:08,635
Put it back.

560
00:46:32,609 --> 00:46:35,121
- You feel better?
- No.

561
00:46:35,499 --> 00:46:38,225
If you'd like, Tony, I would happily
buy you that stone.

562
00:46:38,249 --> 00:46:40,980
Don't bother. You took
all the fun out of it.

563
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:20,050
Excuse me, Sir.

564
00:47:21,217 --> 00:47:23,472
- I'm with the band.
- You're all set up.

565
00:47:23,627 --> 00:47:26,507
- This isn't the piano, right?
- That's it.

566
00:47:26,916 --> 00:47:28,452
It ain't a Steinway.

567
00:47:29,424 --> 00:47:30,588
So what?

568
00:47:30,612 --> 00:47:34,835
Dr. Shirley only plays on Steinway-brand
pianos. It's in his written contract.

569
00:47:35,328 --> 00:47:37,991
- Who's Dr. Shirley?
- Dr. Shirley...

570
00:47:38,015 --> 00:47:39,571
the Don Shirley Trio?

571
00:47:39,595 --> 00:47:40,864
They're playing tonight.

572
00:47:40,885 --> 00:47:44,796
- Does it really matter?
- Yeah, it does, to this contract.

573
00:47:46,432 --> 00:47:50,616
Come on man, these coons can play on
anything you put in front of them.

574
00:47:54,635 --> 00:47:56,417
But it's a piece of shit.

575
00:47:56,441 --> 00:47:57,936
And there is garbage in there.

576
00:47:57,996 --> 00:48:01,360
- So, take it out.
- What'd you say?

577
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:04,607
You heard me.

578
00:48:07,692 --> 00:48:11,895
Hey, you got 2-3 hours.
Just get a clean Steinway in here.

579
00:48:11,919 --> 00:48:15,197
- There ain't no Steinway on campus.
- Not my problem.

580
00:48:15,532 --> 00:48:18,388
I bet there is not two Steinway
in the whole state of Indiana.

581
00:48:18,625 --> 00:48:20,755
I guess you better
move your ass then.

582
00:48:20,805 --> 00:48:22,885
Who do you think you're
talking to, grease ball?

583
00:48:52,672 --> 00:48:57,881
Dear Dolores... This morning I had
steak and eggs. For breakfast.

584
00:48:57,905 --> 00:49:01,784
The band has been playing at very
ritzy joints.

585
00:49:01,912 --> 00:49:05,363
Dr. Shirley and I are getting
along pretty good, but sometimes

586
00:49:05,387 --> 00:49:08,953
I think he gets sad and
that's why he drinks too much.

587
00:49:09,492 --> 00:49:14,630
I never knew how very beautiful this
country was. Now that I'm seeing it I know.

588
00:49:15,321 --> 00:49:20,232
You wouldn't believe how beautiful nature
is, it is as beautiful as they say.

589
00:49:20,373 --> 00:49:24,245
And the traffic out here in the country
is nothing, which is fine by me.

590
00:49:24,882 --> 00:49:27,504
“Right now I'm eating
spaghetti and meatballs in a

591
00:49:27,528 --> 00:49:30,348
diner that tastes like
ketchup on Chinese noodles.

592
00:49:30,932 --> 00:49:33,856
“We are heading down south now...
I will write you

593
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,945
another letter when we get down south.
I love you.

594
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:40,985
- Your husband Tony. P.S.
- Kiss the kids for me.

595
00:49:49,709 --> 00:49:51,411
You got any family, Doc?

596
00:49:51,435 --> 00:49:53,632
- Not really.
- Not really?

597
00:49:53,656 --> 00:49:55,534
Either you do or you don't.

598
00:49:56,656 --> 00:49:58,808
It's a long story, Tony.

599
00:49:58,832 --> 00:50:00,751
What, we're in a hurry now?

600
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:04,175
Let's hear it.

601
00:50:05,192 --> 00:50:07,439
I have a brother somewhere.

602
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:10,595
We used to get together
once in a while... but it

603
00:50:10,619 --> 00:50:12,975
got more and more
difficult to stay in touch.

604
00:50:13,415 --> 00:50:15,896
Curse of being a musician I guess.

605
00:50:16,633 --> 00:50:18,689
Always on the road

606
00:50:18,713 --> 00:50:20,515
like a carnival worker.

607
00:50:21,669 --> 00:50:23,479
Or a criminal.

608
00:50:23,631 --> 00:50:26,065
Took quite a toll on my marriage as
well.

609
00:50:26,186 --> 00:50:28,295
- You're married?
- Was.

610
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:32,081
June, good person.

611
00:50:32,089 --> 00:50:34,376
Terrible grammar,
but a kind soul.

612
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,920
- You'll quite like her.
- June?

613
00:50:37,345 --> 00:50:39,522
Like month?

614
00:50:41,542 --> 00:50:45,883
Unfortunately, I couldn't do a
husband act and a concert pianist act.

615
00:50:46,901 --> 00:50:49,671
Couldn't seem to manage both worlds.

616
00:50:51,594 --> 00:50:53,490
Kentucky Fried Chicken.

617
00:50:53,613 --> 00:50:56,970
In Kentucky! When's
that ever gonna happen?!

618
00:51:11,611 --> 00:51:15,592
- Hey, you want some?
- I'm fine. Thank you Tony.

619
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:22,676
I think this is the best Kentucky
Fried Chicken I ever had.

620
00:51:23,078 --> 00:51:24,984
But I guess it's fresher
down here, right?

621
00:51:25,008 --> 00:51:27,449
I don't think I've ever met
anyone with your appetite.

622
00:51:27,473 --> 00:51:30,067
No, I bought the bucket
so you could have some.

623
00:51:30,091 --> 00:51:32,721
I've never had fried
chicken in my life.

624
00:51:33,484 --> 00:51:38,599
Who you bulletin? You people love the fried
chicken, the grits, the colored greens

625
00:51:39,398 --> 00:51:40,546
I love it, too.

626
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:43,391
The negro cooks used to make
it all time when I was in the army.

627
00:51:43,415 --> 00:51:46,138
You have a very narrow
assessment of me, Tony.

628
00:51:46,299 --> 00:51:48,139
Yeah right? I'm good.

629
00:51:48,286 --> 00:51:51,408
No, you're not good, you're bad.

630
00:51:51,564 --> 00:51:54,354
I'm saying, just because other Negros
enjoy certain types of music, it

631
00:51:54,378 --> 00:51:57,968
doesn't mean I have to. Nor do we
all have to eat the same kind food.

632
00:51:58,965 --> 00:52:03,449
Wait a minute. If you said all guineas
like pizza and spaghetti and meatballs

633
00:52:03,473 --> 00:52:05,990
- I'm not gonna get insulted.
- Well, you're missing the point.

634
00:52:06,014 --> 00:52:08,084
For you to make the
assumption that every Negro...

635
00:52:08,108 --> 00:52:10,182
- Hey, you want some or not?
- No.

636
00:52:10,225 --> 00:52:11,839
Here. Come on.

637
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:15,643
- Tell me that don't smell good?
- It smells okay

638
00:52:15,667 --> 00:52:18,598
I prefer not to
get grease on my blanket.

639
00:52:18,622 --> 00:52:22,537
Ooh, I'm gonna get grease on my blankie.
Come on, have a piece.

640
00:52:22,561 --> 00:52:24,428
It ain't gonna kill ya.
Come on. Take it easy.

641
00:52:24,452 --> 00:52:25,674
- No.
- Take it.

642
00:52:25,878 --> 00:52:28,190
- I'm gonna throw it in the back.
- Don't you dare.

643
00:52:28,214 --> 00:52:31,640
- Then you better take it.
- How? Do you have plates? Or utensils?

644
00:52:31,664 --> 00:52:33,120
Bah fongool! Eat it
with your hands,

645
00:52:33,144 --> 00:52:35,136
- that's how you're supposed to.
- I can't do that.

646
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:38,089
Eat it. Come on. Take it. I gotta drive.
Ten and two on the wheels.

647
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:40,391
Take it. Take it. Come on.

648
00:52:41,194 --> 00:52:42,762
There you go.

649
00:52:44,918 --> 00:52:48,438
- I can't do this Tony.
- Eat the goddamn thing.

650
00:52:49,204 --> 00:52:50,490
Jesus.

651
00:53:00,705 --> 00:53:02,140
What, no good?

652
00:53:08,011 --> 00:53:09,633
Just seems...

653
00:53:10,889 --> 00:53:12,996
so unsanitary.

654
00:53:13,052 --> 00:53:14,885
Who gives a shit?

655
00:53:14,989 --> 00:53:17,205
Just relax and enjoy it.

656
00:53:17,325 --> 00:53:19,580
My father used to say,

657
00:53:20,185 --> 00:53:22,768
whatever you do, do
it a hundred percent.

658
00:53:23,043 --> 00:53:25,712
When you work, work,
when you laugh, laugh,

659
00:53:25,957 --> 00:53:28,860
when you eat, eat like
it's your last meal.

660
00:53:29,314 --> 00:53:32,787
You want another piece?
Here, have a breast.

661
00:53:32,814 --> 00:53:34,280
Delicious.

662
00:53:35,302 --> 00:53:36,947
Take it. There you go.

663
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:39,768
What do we do about the bones?

664
00:53:42,186 --> 00:53:43,675
We do this.

665
00:53:45,341 --> 00:53:47,276
This is what we do.

666
00:53:54,433 --> 00:53:56,141
There you go.

667
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:10,474
What's the big deal with that?
Squirrels will eat it anyway.

668
00:54:48,148 --> 00:54:49,614
This can't be right.

669
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,989
Says right here.

670
00:54:54,026 --> 00:54:56,671
Cozy as your own home.

671
00:54:57,462 --> 00:54:59,794
Place looks like my ass.

672
00:54:59,813 --> 00:55:01,544
This is the place.

673
00:55:07,466 --> 00:55:09,549
Square one please.

674
00:55:10,294 --> 00:55:13,048
- Just this one?
- Thank you.

675
00:55:16,299 --> 00:55:18,129
Hey... Uh...

676
00:55:18,153 --> 00:55:21,915
If you need anything, I'll be right
up the street at the Easton Inn.

677
00:55:22,393 --> 00:55:24,281
Thank you Tony.

678
00:55:28,509 --> 00:55:32,825
- Hey Floyd, we ready?
- Tulley, I can't play, my problem.

679
00:55:35,997 --> 00:55:39,525
Hey, fancy-pants, you wanna play?

680
00:55:40,014 --> 00:55:42,878
- I beg your pardon.
- Come on brother, we short in men.

681
00:55:44,238 --> 00:55:46,094
I... I'd rather not.

682
00:55:46,628 --> 00:55:48,953
What, you too high and mighty?

683
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:53,906
He's just afraid of getting
that butler uniform all that dusty!

684
00:55:55,883 --> 00:55:57,825
I'm just...

685
00:55:58,425 --> 00:56:00,805
I'm on my way out
to meet a friend.

686
00:56:01,527 --> 00:56:03,305
Yeah, thanks for nothing?

687
00:56:06,002 --> 00:56:09,936
- Floyd, come on man.
- Shut your ass up man, leave me alone.

688
00:56:44,825 --> 00:56:47,814
Vacation without aggravation.

689
00:56:57,272 --> 00:57:00,628
Delightful dinners for particular people.

690
00:57:02,931 --> 00:57:05,654
- Yeah?
- Get up! It's George. Get up.

691
00:57:06,868 --> 00:57:09,545
Tony come on. Hurry up!

692
00:57:10,883 --> 00:57:12,625
Dr. Shirley's in trouble.

693
00:57:12,649 --> 00:57:14,555
I went out for a drink,
I walk into this bar,

694
00:57:14,579 --> 00:57:16,724
and Dr Shirley's in there
getting bounced around!

695
00:57:16,790 --> 00:57:19,211
I didn't want to leave him,
but I didn't know what to do!

696
00:57:19,235 --> 00:57:22,654
Who let him out of his cage? And
they put that little tie on him too?

697
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,357
Who you are dressed out?

698
00:57:26,102 --> 00:57:27,912
Get your hands off him.

699
00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:33,568
What in the good goddamn
we got here, fellas?

700
00:57:33,592 --> 00:57:36,479
Hand him over, we walk
out, won't be a problem.

701
00:57:36,834 --> 00:57:39,188
I just wanted a drink Tony.

702
00:57:39,212 --> 00:57:41,998
Hey, I told you, we'll
leave. Not a big deal.

703
00:57:42,022 --> 00:57:42,834
Come on.

704
00:57:42,858 --> 00:57:46,156
He ain't going nowhere, we need a
Brillo pad to wash them dishes with.

705
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:50,363
Listen assholes, do yourself
a favor and let him go.

706
00:57:50,687 --> 00:57:52,028
Now!

707
00:57:54,194 --> 00:57:55,941
Say it nice.

708
00:57:56,663 --> 00:57:58,511
I just said it nice.

709
00:57:58,967 --> 00:58:02,214
This boy's gonna get
what he's got coming to him.

710
00:58:04,118 --> 00:58:07,716
And you... you
ain't got no say!

711
00:58:10,488 --> 00:58:11,808
Maybe.

712
00:58:11,832 --> 00:58:14,210
But, whatever happens
here, I'm gonna put a

713
00:58:14,234 --> 00:58:17,079
bullet right in the middle
of your thick skull.

714
00:58:18,296 --> 00:58:20,410
He ain't got no gun, Ray.

715
00:58:20,445 --> 00:58:22,480
He's fulla shit.

716
00:58:22,757 --> 00:58:24,895
What if he ain't?

717
00:58:28,317 --> 00:58:30,329
Well, I sure ain't.

718
00:58:30,942 --> 00:58:34,431
And I ain't about to let this
come to pass in my place.

719
00:58:37,396 --> 00:58:40,330
Let the spook go. Let him go.

720
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:41,979
Come on.

721
00:58:43,025 --> 00:58:45,006
Get him outta here.

722
00:58:45,342 --> 00:58:49,037
I want these Yankees
off from my property.

723
00:58:49,061 --> 00:58:51,839
- Go home.
- Come on George, go, go.

724
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,581
Go home.

725
00:59:03,607 --> 00:59:04,731
You out of your mind?

726
00:59:04,755 --> 00:59:08,322
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to put you in that position.

727
00:59:09,052 --> 00:59:10,621
Wait, wait, wait!

728
00:59:10,645 --> 00:59:13,079
You wanna throw up again?

729
00:59:14,922 --> 00:59:16,212
I'm OK.

730
00:59:16,236 --> 00:59:18,591
Hones to God Doc,
I don't understand you.

731
00:59:18,648 --> 00:59:21,452
You could have drunk here.
You got a whole bottle.

732
00:59:21,476 --> 00:59:23,924
- I just needed some air.
- Air?

733
00:59:23,948 --> 00:59:25,757
Do you know where you are?

734
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:29,585
Does the geography
really matter?

735
00:59:30,272 --> 00:59:33,175
- What?
- If I was in a bar...

736
00:59:33,568 --> 00:59:35,977
in your neighborhood, would...

737
00:59:36,001 --> 00:59:38,857
the conversation be any different?

738
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:43,516
From now on you don't go nowhere
without me.

739
00:59:43,735 --> 00:59:45,427
Nowhere!

740
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,131
- Got it?
- I understand.

741
00:59:49,446 --> 00:59:52,115
- Where is your room?
- Tony.

742
00:59:52,999 --> 00:59:54,347
What?

743
00:59:55,435 --> 00:59:57,689
Do you really have a gun?

744
00:59:57,732 --> 00:59:59,572
'Course not.

745
01:00:00,194 --> 01:00:03,301
Doc, where's your goddamn room?

746
01:00:07,379 --> 01:00:09,688
- There it is.
- Come on. Over there?

747
01:00:09,933 --> 01:00:13,273
Let me get you to bed Doc. You got
a big show tomorrow night. C'mon.

748
01:00:35,429 --> 01:00:38,769
Louisville. Thank you for
your warm hospitality!

749
01:00:45,502 --> 01:00:47,460
Thank you.

750
01:00:54,714 --> 01:00:57,377
- Don't be lazy Tony, enunciate.
- I ain't.

751
01:00:57,401 --> 01:01:00,648
- Betty bought a bit of better butter.
- Betty bought.

752
01:01:01,104 --> 01:01:03,570
Betty bought... butter...

753
01:01:03,972 --> 01:01:05,627
Who says that?

754
01:01:05,651 --> 01:01:06,702
Butter uh...

755
01:01:06,726 --> 01:01:08,021
you have to start
somewhere Tony.

756
01:01:08,045 --> 01:01:11,553
A singer does vocal exercises, an
athlete warms up, before they rehearse.

757
01:01:11,577 --> 01:01:13,729
Athletes practice,
they don't rehearse.

758
01:01:15,248 --> 01:01:18,089
Ah, shit!

759
01:02:42,373 --> 01:02:47,784
Ladies and gentlemen, our very
special guest from the far north...

760
01:02:47,811 --> 01:02:49,480
Don Shirley!

761
01:02:53,053 --> 01:02:56,891
Accompanying Mr. Shirley,
the members of his trio...

762
01:02:56,915 --> 01:03:01,806
Oleg Malakhov, George
Dyer, and his associate,

763
01:03:01,830 --> 01:03:05,577
Tony Vallla... Valleg... Valle...
Valley... lohnja.

764
01:03:11,024 --> 01:03:13,729
This is my lovely wife Margaret.

765
01:03:13,753 --> 01:03:17,896
If you gentlemen don't mind, I'm going to
steal Donnie away for some introductions.

766
01:03:25,014 --> 01:03:27,417
- What's that?
- Pimiento-cheese sandwich, sir.

767
01:03:27,506 --> 01:03:29,378
Yeah, I'll try that one.

768
01:03:40,273 --> 01:03:42,294
Sorry! Not for me.

769
01:03:49,766 --> 01:03:54,323
Earlier this week, we asked our help
what Mr. Shirley might like for supper.

770
01:03:54,347 --> 01:03:58,289
So the boys in the kitchen whipped up
a special menu in honor of our guest.

771
01:03:58,367 --> 01:04:00,099
Gentlemen.

772
01:04:00,845 --> 01:04:03,232
Home cooked fried chicken.

773
01:04:09,719 --> 01:04:13,661
There you go. Bring them in.
Serve it up hot.

774
01:04:44,534 --> 01:04:46,995
Thank you.

775
01:04:47,019 --> 01:04:49,664
We return after a brief intermission.

776
01:04:52,401 --> 01:04:56,656
- Excuse me, Don. Lovely work in there.
- Why! Thank you!

777
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,270
Are you looking for the commode?
Here, let me help you.

778
01:05:00,281 --> 01:05:02,809
Right out there 'fore that pine.

779
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:09,439
I'd prefer not to use that.

780
01:05:09,856 --> 01:05:12,986
Well, don't be silly, Don. It
looks a lot worse from the outside.

781
01:05:13,106 --> 01:05:15,473
And I'd suppose you'd
know from experience.

782
01:05:15,497 --> 01:05:17,728
What? Never had any complains.

783
01:05:21,635 --> 01:05:25,405
Well, I could return to my motel
and use the facilities there.

784
01:05:26,330 --> 01:05:29,101
But... that would take
at least a half an hour.

785
01:05:32,501 --> 01:05:34,248
We don't mind waiting.

786
01:05:36,482 --> 01:05:39,495
Why don't I just pull over... You
can piss in the woods?

787
01:05:39,525 --> 01:05:41,181
Animals go in the woods.

788
01:05:41,205 --> 01:05:42,624
But it's gonna be at
least twenty minutes if

789
01:05:42,648 --> 01:05:44,108
I gotta go all the way
back to your motel.

790
01:05:44,132 --> 01:05:47,785
So let's just get there so I
can go back and finish the show.

791
01:05:48,276 --> 01:05:50,286
See, that's the difference
between you and me.

792
01:05:50,310 --> 01:05:52,979
- I'd have zero problem goin' in the woods.
- I'm well aware.

793
01:05:53,287 --> 01:05:56,489
Why you sore at me? I don't
make the rules down here.

794
01:05:56,513 --> 01:05:59,783
No? Then who does?

795
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:03,464
Oh! you saying just 'cause
I'm white

796
01:06:03,488 --> 01:06:07,393
and they're white? You know, that's a very
prejudice thing you just said there.

797
01:06:07,417 --> 01:06:09,078
A very prejudice thing.

798
01:06:09,113 --> 01:06:11,824
I got more in common with the
hymies at Second Avenue Deli

799
01:06:11,848 --> 01:06:14,238
than I do with these
hillbilly pricks down here.

800
01:06:14,262 --> 01:06:16,530
- Eyes on the road.
- You always say that when

801
01:06:16,554 --> 01:06:19,461
- you don't like what I'm saying.
- Eyes on the road!

802
01:06:23,672 --> 01:06:25,352
I don't get it.

803
01:06:25,376 --> 01:06:28,419
How does he smile and shake
their hands like that?

804
01:06:28,786 --> 01:06:30,971
If they tried to pull
that outhouse shit on me,

805
01:06:30,995 --> 01:06:33,257
I'd piss right on their
living room floor.

806
01:06:34,683 --> 01:06:36,437
Don't do that.

807
01:06:38,058 --> 01:06:41,109
We have many concert dates left.

808
01:06:43,138 --> 01:06:45,184
Yeah... So...?

809
01:06:45,208 --> 01:06:48,799
You realize we are contractually
obliged to perform them?

810
01:06:49,427 --> 01:06:51,075
Of course I do.

811
01:06:51,099 --> 01:06:53,020
You don't play,
we don't get paid.

812
01:06:53,044 --> 01:06:54,799
What's your point?

813
01:06:55,021 --> 01:06:58,119
Ugly circumstances are
going to happen again.

814
01:06:58,125 --> 01:07:02,841
- So control yourself.
- Don't lecture me, you rat.

815
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:07,753
Dr. Shirley could've
stayed up north getting

816
01:07:07,777 --> 01:07:09,739
rear-end kissed at
Park Avenue parties

817
01:07:09,763 --> 01:07:11,387
for three times money

818
01:07:11,645 --> 01:07:14,090
but he asked for this.

819
01:07:18,772 --> 01:07:20,355
Why?

820
01:07:39,314 --> 01:07:42,014
What on God's green
earth are you doing?

821
01:07:42,072 --> 01:07:43,612
A letter.

822
01:07:43,636 --> 01:07:46,139
Looks more like a
piecemeal ransom note.

823
01:07:46,917 --> 01:07:48,695
May I?

824
01:07:55,614 --> 01:07:58,094
Dear, Dolores...

825
01:07:58,118 --> 01:08:00,622
D-E-A-R, this isn't animal.

826
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:05,177
I'm meeting all the highly
leading citizens of the town.

827
01:08:06,011 --> 01:08:09,539
People that use big words, all
of them

828
01:08:09,698 --> 01:08:12,142
but you know me, I get by,

829
01:08:12,166 --> 01:08:14,249
I'm a good bullshitter.

830
01:08:14,333 --> 01:08:16,479
Two “t”s in “bullshitter.”

831
01:08:16,817 --> 01:08:20,642
As I'm writing this letter,
I'm eating potato chips

832
01:08:20,825 --> 01:08:24,212
and I'm starting to get thirsty.

833
01:08:24,603 --> 01:08:28,178
I washed my socks and
dried them on the TV.

834
01:08:28,574 --> 01:08:32,634
- I should have brung the iron.
- You know this is pathetic right?

835
01:08:33,771 --> 01:08:36,206
Tell me what you're trying to say.

836
01:08:38,224 --> 01:08:41,533
- You know, how I miss her and shit.
- You didn't say that.

837
01:08:42,184 --> 01:08:45,463
But do it in a manner that no
one else has ever done it before.

838
01:08:45,567 --> 01:08:47,759
And without the profanity.

839
01:08:47,927 --> 01:08:52,439
Something like... Put this down.

840
01:08:54,316 --> 01:08:58,492
- Dear Dolores...
- Oh God no!

841
01:08:58,550 --> 01:09:01,547
D-E-A-R, Dolores.

842
01:09:03,366 --> 01:09:05,831
When-I-think-of-you...

843
01:09:06,551 --> 01:09:10,751
I'm-reminded of-the-beautiful
plains of Iowa.

844
01:09:11,024 --> 01:09:12,919
What planes?

845
01:09:13,155 --> 01:09:17,933
The plains. P-L-A-I-N-S.
Those big fields we saw.

846
01:09:18,615 --> 01:09:21,760
Yeah, those were nice.
PLAINS.

847
01:09:22,273 --> 01:09:29,448
Which what they call
big fields around here.

848
01:09:29,472 --> 01:09:31,354
Tony, no expounding.

849
01:09:31,378 --> 01:09:33,759
- A what?
- Just write what I say.

850
01:09:33,783 --> 01:09:37,944
- I'm good.
- The distance between us

851
01:09:39,011 --> 01:09:41,984
is breaking my spirit...

852
01:09:42,623 --> 01:09:44,551
between us...

853
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:49,579
My time and experiences without
you are meaningless to me.

854
01:09:53,409 --> 01:09:57,046
Falling in love with you was the
easiest thing I have ever done.

855
01:09:57,410 --> 01:10:02,262
Falling... in love...
with you...

856
01:10:02,286 --> 01:10:05,313
is very fucking romantic.

857
01:10:05,337 --> 01:10:08,479
It was the easiest
thing I have ever done.

858
01:10:08,503 --> 01:10:11,420
Nothing matters to me but you.

859
01:10:11,553 --> 01:10:15,116
And everyday I am alive, I'm aware of this.

860
01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:19,116
I loved you the day I met
you, I love you today...

861
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:22,723
And I will love you
to rest of my life.

862
01:10:25,064 --> 01:10:29,384
- So can I put the “P.S., kiss the kids”?
- A P.S.?

863
01:10:29,408 --> 01:10:31,584
Yeah, like a the end.

864
01:10:31,789 --> 01:10:36,091
That's like clanging a cowbell at
the end of Shostakovitch's 7th.

865
01:10:36,804 --> 01:10:40,114
Right... So that's good?

866
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:42,672
It's perfect Tony.

867
01:10:46,531 --> 01:10:49,165
Everybody talks about
Willie Maze, 1954, wasn't

868
01:10:49,189 --> 01:10:51,689
even the greatest catcher
in the polo grounds.

869
01:10:51,713 --> 01:10:55,599
That was Joe, 1936,
2nd game at world

870
01:10:55,623 --> 01:10:58,991
series, final out, 500 feet...

871
01:11:02,388 --> 01:11:03,825
Do you like that Doc?

872
01:11:03,849 --> 01:11:06,846
- That's a handsome suit.
- Sharp.

873
01:11:07,269 --> 01:11:09,637
Guy looks just like you.

874
01:11:09,661 --> 01:11:11,758
He does?

875
01:11:12,714 --> 01:11:15,719
Oh... Size-wise. Yeah!

876
01:11:17,163 --> 01:11:19,629
He's about a forty two.

877
01:11:19,858 --> 01:11:22,089
Why don't you try on that?

878
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:25,951
What, you gotta wear a
tuxedo on stage every night?

879
01:11:25,975 --> 01:11:28,123
You could mix it up a little back.

880
01:11:28,147 --> 01:11:31,152
Now, see how that looks on you.
We got plenty of time.

881
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:35,713
I'll be right back.

882
01:11:35,771 --> 01:11:38,591
- How you doing?
- May I help you sir?

883
01:11:38,614 --> 01:11:41,692
Yeah. We wanna try on that
beautiful Grey suit in the window.

884
01:11:41,716 --> 01:11:44,393
- You got it in a 42?
- Of course.

885
01:11:46,990 --> 01:11:50,758
- That's the one.
- Dressing room's in the back, sir.

886
01:11:50,782 --> 01:11:53,476
Thank you. That'll
be just a moment.

887
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:56,537
Take your time Doc, I'll
check out some ties for you.

888
01:11:57,574 --> 01:12:02,188
Uh, excuse me, you're not
allowed to try that on.

889
01:12:03,777 --> 01:12:05,309
I beg your pardon?

890
01:12:05,333 --> 01:12:10,143
If you would like to purchase it first,
we'll be happy to tailor it to your needs.

891
01:12:11,903 --> 01:12:13,629
I see.

892
01:13:16,111 --> 01:13:17,920
Yeah?

893
01:13:18,372 --> 01:13:20,173
F me.

894
01:13:32,934 --> 01:13:36,011
Hey officer, I got a
call about Dr. Shirley.

895
01:13:36,035 --> 01:13:37,596
Come on.

896
01:13:41,790 --> 01:13:44,420
His friends hate her.

897
01:13:44,717 --> 01:13:46,425
Thank you.

898
01:13:50,716 --> 01:13:53,725
Give the guy a towel,
for Chrissakes?

899
01:13:53,749 --> 01:13:55,420
- You the lawyer?
- No.

900
01:13:55,444 --> 01:13:57,598
Well you should call one.
We're taking your Auntie in.

901
01:13:57,622 --> 01:13:58,622
For what?

902
01:13:58,343 --> 01:14:01,043
Manager caught him
and the other guy...

903
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:09,361
Can't we get the cuffs off him, let him
put his pants on? We talk about this?

904
01:14:09,385 --> 01:14:12,553
Sure we could. But we ain't.

905
01:14:12,603 --> 01:14:16,175
OK, look, we're out of
here tomorrow morning...

906
01:14:16,199 --> 01:14:20,404
you'll never see us again. There's gotta
be something due to work this out.

907
01:14:21,503 --> 01:14:25,187
What if, uh, you let him go, and I
give you something to thank you?

908
01:14:26,419 --> 01:14:30,461
- You bribing us?
- No. Hell no. A gift.

909
01:14:30,485 --> 01:14:34,302
- A thank you.
- What kind of thank you?

910
01:14:34,579 --> 01:14:39,833
Like... a donation to the police force.
To you guys.

911
01:14:39,954 --> 01:14:42,122
Whatever you want.

912
01:14:42,493 --> 01:14:44,633
You like suits?

913
01:14:44,657 --> 01:14:49,560
I was walking through your nice town today,
and I seen a store that was selling suits.

914
01:14:49,924 --> 01:14:51,707
Primo suits.

915
01:14:51,731 --> 01:14:57,306
What if... as a thank you... a
donation... I buy you each a suit?

916
01:14:58,438 --> 01:15:02,095
You get all dressed up, you take
the wife out for dinner.

917
01:15:02,119 --> 01:15:06,084
I mean... Guys like you, you
work hard, you deserve it.

918
01:15:13,226 --> 01:15:16,832
They were wrong for the way they
treated me, and you rewarded them.

919
01:15:18,424 --> 01:15:23,136
I was hired to get you from one show to the
next. How I do it shouldn't matter to you.

920
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:26,500
- I just wish you hadn't paid them off.
- I did what I had to do.

921
01:15:27,338 --> 01:15:29,897
You know, if this got out
it would kill your career.

922
01:15:29,921 --> 01:15:31,452
OK. Tony.

923
01:15:31,557 --> 01:15:35,749
I need you to stop it with your phony
altruism and concern for my career.

924
01:15:36,013 --> 01:15:37,197
What the hell does that mean?

925
01:15:37,221 --> 01:15:39,360
You were only thinking
about yourself back there

926
01:15:39,384 --> 01:15:42,056
because you know if I miss a show,
it comes out of your pocket book.

927
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:45,034
Of course I don't want you to miss
a show, you ungrateful bastard!

928
01:15:45,058 --> 01:15:47,123
You think I'm doing
this for my health?

929
01:15:47,147 --> 01:15:51,777
Tonight I saved your ass, so show
a little appreciation... Maybe?

930
01:15:51,801 --> 01:15:55,103
Besides, I told you never
to go nowhere without me!

931
01:15:56,088 --> 01:15:59,570
I assumed you would want
this to be the exception.

932
01:16:34,706 --> 01:16:38,463
Want me to get some makeup or
something before the show?

933
01:16:38,487 --> 01:16:39,848
No I'm fine.

934
01:16:39,872 --> 01:16:43,713
- You sure? Bruise kindda shrugs.
- I said I'm fine.

935
01:16:44,911 --> 01:16:46,541
Okay.

936
01:17:00,061 --> 01:17:02,082
Tony Lip?

937
01:17:02,113 --> 01:17:04,831
Dominic. The hell you
guys doing here?

938
01:17:04,855 --> 01:17:08,188
Brooklyn sent us down...
take care of a few things.

939
01:17:42,350 --> 01:17:44,909
I am working here.

940
01:17:52,842 --> 01:17:55,698
Sorry Doc, they are some
friends from New York.

941
01:17:56,404 --> 01:17:59,604
Hey, you get Dr Shirley's luggage?
Alright.

942
01:18:32,329 --> 01:18:35,154
Called his room. He'll be
down in a minute.

943
01:18:44,331 --> 01:18:47,149
- Hey Doc.
- Where are you off to?

944
01:18:48,875 --> 01:18:52,934
Just going downstairs.
To have a drink.

945
01:19:03,354 --> 01:19:05,252
Tony...

946
01:19:05,276 --> 01:19:08,375
I think you're doing
a wonderful job.

947
01:19:08,456 --> 01:19:10,414
So...

948
01:19:11,048 --> 01:19:14,797
I would like to formally offer you
the position of my road manager.

949
01:19:14,821 --> 01:19:16,545
With the title...

950
01:19:16,569 --> 01:19:19,378
also comes more responsibility but

951
01:19:19,764 --> 01:19:22,238
that also means a raise in pay.

952
01:19:22,303 --> 01:19:25,847
No. No. No, thanks.

953
01:19:27,443 --> 01:19:31,872
I mean, we agreed on a hundred and
twenty-five a week, plus expenses.

954
01:19:31,896 --> 01:19:34,564
That's our deal. Right?

955
01:19:36,074 --> 01:19:40,431
I ain't goin' nowhere, Doc. I was
just goin' down to tell 'em.

956
01:19:50,681 --> 01:19:52,577
Tony...

957
01:19:56,778 --> 01:19:59,337
I'm sorry about last night.

958
01:20:02,702 --> 01:20:05,089
Don't worry about it.

959
01:20:06,483 --> 01:20:09,750
I been working nightclubs in
the New York city my whole life...

960
01:20:09,774 --> 01:20:11,581
I know it's...

961
01:20:12,298 --> 01:20:14,295
complicated world.

962
01:20:26,665 --> 01:20:29,349
So, where'd you learn
how to play like that?

963
01:20:29,373 --> 01:20:30,547
My mother.

964
01:20:30,571 --> 01:20:33,037
Your mother... Really?

965
01:20:34,585 --> 01:20:37,785
She taught me how to
play in an old spinet.

966
01:20:38,359 --> 01:20:40,761
Soon as I could walk.

967
01:20:40,785 --> 01:20:43,672
Travel around the Florida panhandle...

968
01:20:43,699 --> 01:20:47,031
Put on my little shows
and perishes in halls...

969
01:20:47,091 --> 01:20:49,154
Fortunately a man who
had seen me play

970
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:52,815
arranged for me to study at the
Leningrad Conservatory of Music.

971
01:20:53,027 --> 01:20:55,508
I was the first Negro
ever accepted there.

972
01:20:55,571 --> 01:20:58,323
So that's where they taught
you all them songs you play?

973
01:20:58,347 --> 01:21:00,906
Actually, I was trained
to play classical music.

974
01:21:00,930 --> 01:21:05,974
Brahms, Franz Liszt,
Beethoven, Chopin...

975
01:21:06,595 --> 01:21:09,451
it's all I ever wanted to play.

976
01:21:09,537 --> 01:21:15,049
But I was persuaded by my record company to
pursue a career in popular music instead.

977
01:21:15,546 --> 01:21:17,862
They insisted that
audiences would never

978
01:21:17,886 --> 01:21:20,738
accept a negro pianist
on the classical stage.

979
01:21:20,955 --> 01:21:24,515
Wanted to turn me into just
another “colored entertainer.”

980
01:21:25,330 --> 01:21:27,253
You know the guy who...

981
01:21:27,277 --> 01:21:32,636
smoking while he's playing, sets a glass of
whiskey on his piano and then he complains

982
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:35,900
because he's not respected
like Arthur Rubinstein.

983
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:41,643
You don't see Arthur Rubenstein putting
a glass of whiskey on his piano.

984
01:21:42,702 --> 01:21:44,000
I don't know...

985
01:21:44,024 --> 01:21:48,075
I think if you stuck to that classic
stuff it would've been a big mistake.

986
01:21:48,099 --> 01:21:52,752
A mistake? Performing the music I
trained my entire life to play?

987
01:21:52,787 --> 01:21:55,402
Trained? What are you, a seal?

988
01:21:55,426 --> 01:21:57,046
People love what you do.

989
01:21:57,070 --> 01:22:02,279
Anyone can sound like Beethoven or
Joe Pan or them other guys you said.

990
01:22:02,303 --> 01:22:06,854
But your music, what you do...

991
01:22:07,486 --> 01:22:10,225
Only you can do that.

992
01:22:12,325 --> 01:22:14,252
Thank you Tony.

993
01:22:18,210 --> 01:22:21,121
But... not everyone can play
Chopin...

994
01:22:22,406 --> 01:22:24,418
not like I can.

995
01:22:28,604 --> 01:22:31,135
The trees have shed
their leafy clothing

996
01:22:31,159 --> 01:22:34,216
and their colors have faded
to grays and browns.

997
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:40,210
I saw a millions of trees all dusted
with snow just like out of a fairy tale.

998
01:22:40,234 --> 01:22:42,455
Oh, he's so expressive.

999
01:22:42,727 --> 01:22:45,327
Gotta admit, Lip's letters...

1000
01:22:45,351 --> 01:22:48,131
- They are not bad.
- Oh well! It's in the family.

1001
01:22:48,155 --> 01:22:50,801
They say our great,
great, great grandfather

1002
01:22:50,825 --> 01:22:53,210
helped Da Vinci with
the Sixteen Chapel.

1003
01:22:53,234 --> 01:22:54,704
You mean Michelangelo?

1004
01:22:54,728 --> 01:22:55,704
Right.

1005
01:22:55,728 --> 01:22:58,024
What is Michelangelo have
to do with writing letters?

1006
01:22:58,048 --> 01:23:02,568
- I'm just saying, we're an arty family.
- I would count the hours...

1007
01:23:02,592 --> 01:23:07,310
minutes... and seconds...
until you are in my arms.

1008
01:23:07,334 --> 01:23:09,148
Love you, Tony.

1009
01:23:09,172 --> 01:23:11,451
P.S. KISS THE KIDS.

1010
01:23:11,738 --> 01:23:14,239
- John.
- Yeah?

1011
01:23:14,263 --> 01:23:16,075
I want a letter.

1012
01:23:16,099 --> 01:23:18,438
Yeah, as soon as you make a meal.

1013
01:23:32,914 --> 01:23:35,958
Eyes on the road.

1014
01:24:00,418 --> 01:24:01,667
Tony.

1015
01:24:01,691 --> 01:24:05,639
Alright everybody! Let's
give a finest Louisiana

1016
01:24:05,663 --> 01:24:09,809
welcome to Don Shirley and
the Don Shirley Trio!

1017
01:24:35,297 --> 01:24:39,793
Your mother's ass... piece of shit.

1018
01:24:47,429 --> 01:24:49,808
Hell's this guy doing?

1019
01:24:52,431 --> 01:24:55,068
Son of a bitch.

1020
01:25:06,931 --> 01:25:09,459
License and papers?

1021
01:25:09,786 --> 01:25:11,926
Am I glad to see you.

1022
01:25:11,950 --> 01:25:16,838
We had a turn off from main road...
and uh, now we're lost.

1023
01:25:18,379 --> 01:25:21,569
- Step out of the car.
- What I do?

1024
01:25:21,593 --> 01:25:23,754
Out of the car.

1025
01:25:34,884 --> 01:25:37,235
Why you on this road?

1026
01:25:37,259 --> 01:25:41,982
I told you, we had to make
a detour and we got lost.

1027
01:25:45,928 --> 01:25:48,523
And why you driving him?

1028
01:25:48,547 --> 01:25:50,722
He's my boss.

1029
01:25:56,181 --> 01:26:00,542
He can't be out here at night.
This is a sundown town.

1030
01:26:00,566 --> 01:26:02,288
What's that?

1031
01:26:03,183 --> 01:26:09,438
- Get him out of the car. Check his I.D.
- Come on, it's pouring rain sir.

1032
01:26:09,462 --> 01:26:11,874
I can just get it right
here through the window.

1033
01:26:11,898 --> 01:26:13,243
Get him out of the car!

1034
01:26:13,267 --> 01:26:16,139
- Come on.
- Get out now! Get out!

1035
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:18,889
You got ID?

1036
01:26:20,857 --> 01:26:23,481
How you say this last name?

1037
01:26:23,505 --> 01:26:25,815
Vallelonga.

1038
01:26:26,068 --> 01:26:28,277
'Hell kind of name is that?

1039
01:26:28,301 --> 01:26:29,975
It's Italian.

1040
01:26:29,999 --> 01:26:35,230
Oh, now I see. That's why you
driving him around.

1041
01:26:36,767 --> 01:26:38,990
You half a nigger yourself.

1042
01:26:40,205 --> 01:26:44,030
Hands in the air, now, now!

1043
01:26:46,579 --> 01:26:48,279
Excuse me.

1044
01:26:51,921 --> 01:26:53,879
Excuse me, sirs.

1045
01:26:56,171 --> 01:26:58,705
I understand why my
associate is being held,

1046
01:26:58,729 --> 01:27:01,293
but what exactly am I
being charged with?

1047
01:27:04,738 --> 01:27:07,236
You seem like reasonable men.

1048
01:27:07,566 --> 01:27:11,151
Perhaps you could let me out so that we
could discuss the situation further?

1049
01:27:11,175 --> 01:27:16,015
Just put the apple butter away, boy.
You ain't goin' nowhere no time soon.

1050
01:27:16,833 --> 01:27:20,939
- You cannot hold me without cause!
- Well I got cause.

1051
01:27:20,974 --> 01:27:24,339
'Cause you let the sun
set on your black ass!

1052
01:27:25,325 --> 01:27:29,884
I want to speak to my
lawyer, I want my call!

1053
01:27:29,908 --> 01:27:33,038
This is a flagrant
violation of my rights!

1054
01:27:33,310 --> 01:27:35,081
You know...

1055
01:27:36,373 --> 01:27:41,096
He does have... rights.

1056
01:27:45,428 --> 01:27:49,941
Give the negro his goddamn phone call.
You happy?

1057
01:27:54,358 --> 01:27:58,160
You know a lawyer? Call him.

1058
01:28:15,095 --> 01:28:18,787
As my mother always said, “What
kind of brand new fool are you?!”

1059
01:28:19,337 --> 01:28:21,202
Look at them over there.

1060
01:28:21,226 --> 01:28:24,744
Take a good look at the officer you hit.
Look at him.

1061
01:28:24,768 --> 01:28:28,578
He's over there having a grand
old time, chatting up his pals

1062
01:28:28,667 --> 01:28:32,188
enjoying a nice cup of coffee.
And where are you?

1063
01:28:32,212 --> 01:28:35,990
In here, with me,
who did nothing.

1064
01:28:36,167 --> 01:28:38,019
Yet I'm the one who's
pays the price.

1065
01:28:38,043 --> 01:28:40,699
I'm the one who's gonna
miss the Birmingham show.

1066
01:28:40,723 --> 01:28:44,081
Hey, I'm losing a lot of money,
too, if you don't play Birmingham.

1067
01:28:44,105 --> 01:28:47,962
So that little temper
tantrum... was it worth it?

1068
01:28:50,869 --> 01:28:54,485
You don't win with violence,
Tony, you win when you

1069
01:28:54,509 --> 01:28:58,045
maintain your dignity.
Dignity always prevails.

1070
01:28:58,653 --> 01:29:02,509
And tonight, because
of you, we did not.

1071
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:10,182
I wouldn't touch that mattress Doc.

1072
01:29:14,735 --> 01:29:16,248
No sir.

1073
01:29:16,470 --> 01:29:19,428
No. No I'm not sir.

1074
01:29:19,541 --> 01:29:22,217
Yes, sir, he's right
here, yes sir.

1075
01:29:22,564 --> 01:29:25,163
- Yes sir.
- Give me.

1076
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:28,788
Chief Pratt... who's this?
Bull-oney.

1077
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:32,748
Yes sir.

1078
01:29:32,772 --> 01:29:35,238
I can hear it now, Governor.

1079
01:29:39,475 --> 01:29:42,738
No sir, I'm sorry. But, of course
I recognize your voice.

1080
01:29:45,906 --> 01:29:47,785
Sir...

1081
01:29:48,354 --> 01:29:52,336
You saying the boy we got
locked up called who?

1082
01:29:54,858 --> 01:29:57,776
Oh, and he called you?

1083
01:29:58,056 --> 01:30:01,538
No sir, but an officer was
assaulted in the line of...

1084
01:30:04,940 --> 01:30:09,436
No, no, I don't want no National Guard
coming down here, neither, sir.

1085
01:30:10,543 --> 01:30:13,040
Yes, Governor, immediately.

1086
01:30:13,301 --> 01:30:16,126
Good night to you
and the missus.

1087
01:30:19,743 --> 01:30:21,826
- Get them out.
- What?!

1088
01:30:22,006 --> 01:30:25,401
- Cut 'em goddamn loose.
- That dago-wop hit me!

1089
01:30:25,436 --> 01:30:28,134
You keep your goddamn job?
Then you do what I goddamn

1090
01:30:28,158 --> 01:30:31,381
tell you to do, when I
goddamn tell you to do it.

1091
01:30:31,405 --> 01:30:33,941
Now I'm telling you to
get 'em the goddamn out.

1092
01:30:34,139 --> 01:30:36,949
Who the hell did you call?

1093
01:30:38,593 --> 01:30:44,183
Bobby Kennedy just saved our asses!
Maddon... How great is that?!

1094
01:30:44,183 --> 01:30:45,964
It's not great.

1095
01:30:45,988 --> 01:30:48,364
It's not great at
Al, it's humiliating.

1096
01:30:48,388 --> 01:30:52,298
'The hell you talking about?
We were screwed, now we ain't.

1097
01:30:52,491 --> 01:30:55,130
And I just put the Attorney
General of the United

1098
01:30:55,154 --> 01:30:57,886
- States in an incredibly awkward position.
- So what?

1099
01:30:57,910 --> 01:31:00,821
That's what the guy gets paid for.
What else he got to do?

1100
01:31:00,909 --> 01:31:04,743
That man and his brother are
trying to change this country,

1101
01:31:04,767 --> 01:31:06,688
that's what else he's got to do!

1102
01:31:07,744 --> 01:31:10,054
Now he thinks I'm
some kind of...

1103
01:31:11,401 --> 01:31:16,206
Calling from some backwoods swamp jail,
asking to attenuate assault charges...

1104
01:31:16,230 --> 01:31:17,516
who does that?

1105
01:31:17,661 --> 01:31:20,002
Garbage, that's who.

1106
01:31:20,415 --> 01:31:21,539
You shouldn't have hit him.

1107
01:31:21,563 --> 01:31:25,018
I didn't like the way he was treating you,
making you stand out in the rain like that.

1108
01:31:25,042 --> 01:31:28,367
Please, you hit him because
of what he called you.

1109
01:31:28,514 --> 01:31:30,719
I've had to endure that kind
of talk my entire life,

1110
01:31:30,743 --> 01:31:32,468
you should be able to take
it for at least one night.

1111
01:31:32,492 --> 01:31:35,570
What, I can't get mad at that stuff
he was saying 'cause I ain't black?

1112
01:31:35,594 --> 01:31:38,092
- Christ, I'm blacker than you.
- Excuse me?

1113
01:31:38,116 --> 01:31:40,621
You don't know shit
about your own people!

1114
01:31:40,645 --> 01:31:43,295
What they eat, how they
talk, how they live.

1115
01:31:43,319 --> 01:31:45,060
You don't even know
who Lil' Richard is!

1116
01:31:45,084 --> 01:31:48,489
Oh so knowing who Little Richard
is makes you blacker than me?

1117
01:31:48,786 --> 01:31:51,268
Oh Tony, I wish you could
hear yourself sometimes

1118
01:31:51,292 --> 01:31:53,851
- you wouldn't talk so damn much.
- Bullshit.

1119
01:31:53,933 --> 01:31:56,350
I know exactly who I am.

1120
01:31:56,374 --> 01:31:59,670
I'm the guy who's lived on the same
neighborhood in the Bronx my entire life,

1121
01:31:59,694 --> 01:32:02,302
with my mother, my father, my
brother, and now my wife and kids.

1122
01:32:02,326 --> 01:32:04,538
That's it, that's who I am.

1123
01:32:04,562 --> 01:32:08,106
I'm the asshole who's gotta hustle every
goddamn day to put food out on table.

1124
01:32:08,130 --> 01:32:11,895
You? Mr. Big Shot? You
live on top of a castle

1125
01:32:11,919 --> 01:32:14,537
traveling around the world doing
concerts for rich people...

1126
01:32:14,561 --> 01:32:17,346
I live on the streets,
you sit on a throne

1127
01:32:17,370 --> 01:32:20,601
so yeah, my world is way
more blacker than yours!

1128
01:32:21,257 --> 01:32:23,230
Pull over.

1129
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:25,421
- What?
- Pull over.

1130
01:32:25,445 --> 01:32:28,614
- I ain't pulling over!
- Stop the car Tony!

1131
01:32:30,406 --> 01:32:31,965
What?

1132
01:32:32,093 --> 01:32:34,449
What are you doing?!

1133
01:32:37,757 --> 01:32:40,043
Doc, what the hell are you doing?

1134
01:32:40,109 --> 01:32:42,874
Doc, get back in the car.

1135
01:32:42,898 --> 01:32:46,363
Yes, I live in a castle!
Tony. Alone!

1136
01:32:47,083 --> 01:32:49,307
And rich white people pay
me to play piano for

1137
01:32:49,331 --> 01:32:51,565
them, because it makes
them feel cultured.

1138
01:32:51,667 --> 01:32:53,361
But as soon as I
step off that stage

1139
01:32:53,385 --> 01:32:56,055
I go right back to being
just another nigger to them.

1140
01:32:56,518 --> 01:32:59,277
Because that is
their true culture.

1141
01:32:59,301 --> 01:33:02,721
And I suffer that slight alone, because
I'm not accepted by my own people,

1142
01:33:02,745 --> 01:33:04,796
because I'm not
like them either!

1143
01:33:05,420 --> 01:33:08,283
So if I'm not black enough,
and if I'm not white enough,

1144
01:33:08,307 --> 01:33:11,912
and if I'm not man enough,
then tell me Tony, what am I?!

1145
01:33:45,771 --> 01:33:48,339
I need some sleep.

1146
01:33:51,270 --> 01:33:52,595
A'right.

1147
01:33:53,379 --> 01:33:56,790
I'll stop by the next place we see
and I'll sneak you into my room.

1148
01:33:56,814 --> 01:34:01,598
No. No. I refuse to stay in an
establishment where I'm not welcome.

1149
01:34:04,385 --> 01:34:07,179
Yeah. OK.

1150
01:34:24,057 --> 01:34:26,960
Tony, do you have to smoke everywhere?

1151
01:34:28,596 --> 01:34:30,858
I didn't know it would bother you.

1152
01:34:30,885 --> 01:34:33,023
Should have told me.

1153
01:34:33,430 --> 01:34:36,512
All you gotta do, is say the word Doc.

1154
01:34:48,696 --> 01:34:52,130
You do realize you'd be home
before that letter arrives?

1155
01:34:52,383 --> 01:34:53,958
Yeah, I know.

1156
01:34:53,981 --> 01:34:57,603
Just thought of bringing it with me.
Save on the stamps.

1157
01:34:57,709 --> 01:35:01,995
A'right, Tony. Give
it here, I'll fix it.

1158
01:35:02,637 --> 01:35:07,282
No offense, Doc, but I think
I got the hang of it now.

1159
01:35:14,108 --> 01:35:18,699
Dear Dolores. Sometimes
you remind me of a house.

1160
01:35:21,696 --> 01:35:24,867
A house with beautiful
lights on it

1161
01:35:24,891 --> 01:35:27,739
where everyone happy inside.

1162
01:35:32,466 --> 01:35:36,346
Yes, Tony! You go it.

1163
01:35:39,249 --> 01:35:41,160
Thanks.

1164
01:35:43,688 --> 01:35:48,435
Doc, thanks for helping
me with the letters.

1165
01:35:48,570 --> 01:35:53,168
- You're really good at writing them.
- My pleasure Tony.

1166
01:35:54,413 --> 01:35:59,964
You know, when you get home, maybe you
should write one to your brother?

1167
01:36:02,105 --> 01:36:05,352
He knows where I am if he
ever wants to reconnect.

1168
01:36:05,683 --> 01:36:09,039
If... I wouldn't wait.

1169
01:36:09,316 --> 01:36:15,336
You know... the world's full of lonely
people afraid to make the first move.

1170
01:36:36,332 --> 01:36:40,384
You know Doc, something's been
eating at me this whole trip.

1171
01:36:43,946 --> 01:36:46,689
That Tittsburgh was a
major disappointment.

1172
01:36:46,713 --> 01:36:49,752
I didn't notice any difference at all.
Did you?

1173
01:36:49,776 --> 01:36:51,804
Good night Tony.

1174
01:37:04,106 --> 01:37:06,705
- Good Evening. Welcome.
- Welcome. Come on in.

1175
01:37:14,097 --> 01:37:16,179
Welcome Mr Shirley.

1176
01:37:16,229 --> 01:37:19,909
Graham Kindell, I'm the general manager.
It is a pleasure to meet you.

1177
01:37:19,933 --> 01:37:23,066
Thank you, Mr. Kindell. This
is Mr. Tony Vallelonga.

1178
01:37:23,090 --> 01:37:24,801
- Nice to meet you, Tony.
- How you doing?

1179
01:37:24,825 --> 01:37:29,429
Let's keep the car right here on our guest
of honor spot. Right this way, gentlemen.

1180
01:37:29,453 --> 01:37:31,761
- How was your drive up?
- Oh it's wonderful.

1181
01:37:31,785 --> 01:37:33,305
Good to hear, good to hear.

1182
01:37:33,329 --> 01:37:36,020
As you can imagine our Christmas
show is the biggest show of

1183
01:37:36,044 --> 01:37:38,962
the year and we are so happy
to have you here Mr Shirley.

1184
01:37:38,986 --> 01:37:42,243
So, if you need anything... anything
t'all... you let me know.

1185
01:37:42,267 --> 01:37:44,650
- Oh thank you.
- Now, here we are...

1186
01:37:44,674 --> 01:37:47,682
I got about an hour before show time.
Any questions?

1187
01:37:48,237 --> 01:37:49,820
Where's the restaurant?

1188
01:37:49,844 --> 01:37:53,641
Well, you continue down the hall here,
Tony, to the right, across the lobby.

1189
01:37:53,665 --> 01:37:57,107
- Good luck! Break a leg.
- Thank you.

1190
01:37:58,058 --> 01:38:01,652
He said we've got an hour.
You must be starving Doc.

1191
01:38:01,676 --> 01:38:03,695
Go ahead, I'll meet you there.

1192
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:31,422
May we join you?

1193
01:38:32,782 --> 01:38:34,263
Get in.

1194
01:38:39,372 --> 01:38:42,150
- Cocktail, gentlemen?
- I'm good.

1195
01:38:42,275 --> 01:38:45,421
- 3 shots Vodka.
- Whoa!

1196
01:38:45,624 --> 01:38:49,589
Last show. Cold war over.
Time for truce.

1197
01:38:50,674 --> 01:38:53,714
- Is Dr Shirley in his dressing room?
- Yeah.

1198
01:38:53,738 --> 01:38:55,534
More like a broom closet.

1199
01:38:55,558 --> 01:38:58,696
Tell you, I don't know why he
puts up with that shit.

1200
01:39:02,321 --> 01:39:06,013
Six years ago, in 1956,

1201
01:39:06,150 --> 01:39:11,975
Nat King Cole was invited to perform at the
Municipal Auditorium here in Birmingham.

1202
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:17,712
Mr. Cole was the first negro asked to play
at a white establishment in this city.

1203
01:39:17,736 --> 01:39:21,062
As soon as he started playing,
a group of men attacked him

1204
01:39:21,086 --> 01:39:23,202
for playing white
people's music.

1205
01:39:23,905 --> 01:39:26,284
They pulled him off stage

1206
01:39:26,795 --> 01:39:29,050
beat him badly.

1207
01:39:29,051 --> 01:39:31,665
Jesus Christ!

1208
01:39:34,318 --> 01:39:36,737
You asked once

1209
01:39:36,772 --> 01:39:39,417
why Dr. Shirley does this?

1210
01:39:40,064 --> 01:39:41,716
I tell you.

1211
01:39:41,740 --> 01:39:47,744
Because genius is not enough. It takes
courage to change people's hearts.

1212
01:39:55,633 --> 01:39:57,364
Thanks.

1213
01:39:57,797 --> 01:39:59,434
Thank you.

1214
01:40:27,205 --> 01:40:30,150
- I understand but...
- What's going on?

1215
01:40:30,174 --> 01:40:34,485
This gentleman says that I'm
not permitted dine here.

1216
01:40:34,509 --> 01:40:37,666
No, you don't understand, he's
playing tonight, he's the main event.

1217
01:40:37,690 --> 01:40:41,298
I'm sorry. But it's the
policy of the restaurant.

1218
01:40:41,322 --> 01:40:44,166
- Everything all right?
- No, it's not all right.

1219
01:40:44,190 --> 01:40:46,925
This guy is saying Dr
Shirley can't eat here.

1220
01:40:46,949 --> 01:40:51,088
Well, I apologize, but these are...
longstanding traditions.

1221
01:40:51,112 --> 01:40:53,622
Club rules. I'm sure
you understand.

1222
01:40:53,646 --> 01:40:56,101
No. I do not understand.

1223
01:41:01,399 --> 01:41:02,927
I'm sorry.

1224
01:41:02,968 --> 01:41:05,575
Wait a minute, are you
tellin' me the bozos

1225
01:41:05,599 --> 01:41:08,242
in his band, and these
people that came here

1226
01:41:08,266 --> 01:41:13,441
to see him play, they can eat here, but the
star of the show, spot of honor, he can't.

1227
01:41:13,904 --> 01:41:15,320
I'm afraid not.

1228
01:41:15,344 --> 01:41:19,167
Well he's gotta eat, I mean
he's gotta have dinner.

1229
01:41:20,618 --> 01:41:23,291
I tell you what. Why don't
we bring something to

1230
01:41:23,315 --> 01:41:25,956
his dressing room, huh?
John, show him the menu.

1231
01:41:25,980 --> 01:41:30,375
No. I'm not eating in
that storage room.

1232
01:41:31,105 --> 01:41:34,979
Okay... if you'd prefer, there's a
very popular establishment right

1233
01:41:35,003 --> 01:41:38,790
down the road, the Orange Bird,
they'd be happy to feed you.

1234
01:41:40,992 --> 01:41:42,840
Doc, come here.

1235
01:41:44,335 --> 01:41:45,739
One second just.

1236
01:41:46,406 --> 01:41:50,600
C'mon, maybe that place is better anyway.
The dinner rolls here are like rocks.

1237
01:41:50,624 --> 01:41:53,465
Let's just go over...
just go and come back.

1238
01:41:57,597 --> 01:41:59,922
It's the last show.

1239
01:41:59,977 --> 01:42:02,443
Bottom of the knife. Let's
just get it over with

1240
01:42:02,467 --> 01:42:05,232
and we can go home and get
away from these pricks.

1241
01:42:06,938 --> 01:42:10,920
Ah, there you go, the fish
is wonderful tonight.

1242
01:42:16,094 --> 01:42:21,442
Either I eat in this room,
or I'm not performing tonight.

1243
01:42:24,950 --> 01:42:28,150
May I have a word with you?

1244
01:42:41,267 --> 01:42:45,474
Mr. Villanueva, you have to talk sense to
Mr. Shirley. Please make him understand

1245
01:42:45,498 --> 01:42:49,810
we're not insulting him personally, this
is just the way things are done down here.

1246
01:42:49,834 --> 01:42:51,942
Yeah, well he's not
from down here.

1247
01:42:51,966 --> 01:42:54,350
Just ask him to be reasonable.
I got 400 guests

1248
01:42:54,374 --> 01:42:56,757
in there who expect to
be entertained tonight.

1249
01:42:56,781 --> 01:42:58,930
And Dr. Shirley expects
to eat tonight.

1250
01:42:58,954 --> 01:43:01,863
Why can't you just make an
exception this one time?

1251
01:43:03,157 --> 01:43:05,492
Lemme tell you a story.

1252
01:43:05,516 --> 01:43:09,450
You ever hear of the Boston
Celtics basketball club?

1253
01:43:09,489 --> 01:43:13,658
Yeah, those boys came through here a
couple years ago on a barnstorming tour.

1254
01:43:13,682 --> 01:43:15,355
Now, seeing as they were World
Champions of the league and all, we

1255
01:43:15,379 --> 01:43:19,648
were tickled to have 'em eat here,
we rolled out the welcome wagon.

1256
01:43:19,918 --> 01:43:23,275
So do you know what table their
big coon ate at that night?

1257
01:43:24,367 --> 01:43:26,813
- No.
- I don't either.

1258
01:43:26,837 --> 01:43:30,583
But it wasn't one of ours.
Now let's cut the bullshit.

1259
01:43:30,607 --> 01:43:32,491
Tell me what it's gonna take.

1260
01:43:32,515 --> 01:43:36,221
Say one hundred dollars and
you get your boy to play?

1261
01:43:37,450 --> 01:43:39,829
You think you can buy me?

1262
01:43:39,831 --> 01:43:42,047
With all due respect,
sir, but you wouldn't be

1263
01:43:42,071 --> 01:43:45,090
in a job like this if
you couldn't be bought.

1264
01:43:45,164 --> 01:43:47,481
Stop! Tony.

1265
01:43:48,766 --> 01:43:50,973
It's alright.

1266
01:43:52,606 --> 01:43:54,782
I'll play.

1267
01:43:55,012 --> 01:43:57,169
If you want me to.

1268
01:44:12,195 --> 01:44:14,575
Let's get the fuck outta here.

1269
01:44:14,625 --> 01:44:17,242
What do you mean,
let's get outta here?

1270
01:44:17,266 --> 01:44:19,687
Where the hell do you
think you're going?

1271
01:44:19,711 --> 01:44:21,727
Don, don't do this! Now you
signed a contract.

1272
01:44:21,751 --> 01:44:24,505
And I know you're the kind of
man who honors a contract!

1273
01:44:26,111 --> 01:44:29,009
You got a show to do, mister!
You turn yourself

1274
01:44:29,033 --> 01:44:31,647
around. Right now goddammit!
Right now!

1275
01:44:32,127 --> 01:44:35,847
This is why you people don't work
down here, cause you're unreliable.

1276
01:44:35,871 --> 01:44:39,844
You hear me? I shipped that goddamn
Steinway in from Atlanta for you.

1277
01:44:46,574 --> 01:44:48,110
Tony.

1278
01:44:48,246 --> 01:44:49,816
Are you hungry?

1279
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:51,891
Does Betty like butter?

1280
01:45:36,942 --> 01:45:41,001
- You a cop?
- Do I look Irish?

1281
01:45:41,025 --> 01:45:45,006
- What you want, baby?
- Two Cutty's, neat.

1282
01:45:53,518 --> 01:45:56,363
Whatever your specialty
is, we'll take it.

1283
01:45:56,387 --> 01:45:59,080
Two orange birds!

1284
01:46:10,779 --> 01:46:13,177
I like what you did
back there, Doc.

1285
01:46:13,201 --> 01:46:15,596
You stood up for yourself.

1286
01:46:17,281 --> 01:46:21,528
It's like your friend the
President says “Ask not

1287
01:46:22,546 --> 01:46:25,050
your country what you could do for it,

1288
01:46:25,264 --> 01:46:27,949
ask what you do for yourself.”

1289
01:46:32,586 --> 01:46:34,351
So, darlin',

1290
01:46:34,375 --> 01:46:37,189
what you do, all
dressed up like that?

1291
01:46:37,213 --> 01:46:39,694
Nothing particularly important.

1292
01:46:40,318 --> 01:46:43,245
Shouldn't judge a man by his clothes.

1293
01:46:43,591 --> 01:46:46,707
He's only the greatest piano player
in the world.

1294
01:46:46,731 --> 01:46:49,713
That right? You good?

1295
01:46:50,713 --> 01:46:56,906
- Don't be shy, Doc. Tell her who you are.
- Don't tell me nothing, show me.

1296
01:47:03,027 --> 01:47:05,001
Man...

1297
01:50:23,562 --> 01:50:25,433
That's how you break a peak.

1298
01:50:27,702 --> 01:50:31,598
Oh, that was a good time, I do
that once a month for free.

1299
01:50:31,788 --> 01:50:34,363
- You're unbelievable.
- Hey Tony.

1300
01:50:35,109 --> 01:50:37,477
I bet if we leave right
now, we can make it.

1301
01:50:37,501 --> 01:50:41,598
- Make what?
- Christmas Eve. In New York city.

1302
01:50:57,111 --> 01:51:00,686
Don't ever flash a wad
of cash in a bar.

1303
01:51:10,022 --> 01:51:12,144
I knew you had a gun!

1304
01:51:36,674 --> 01:51:38,881
It's getting bad Doc.

1305
01:51:39,525 --> 01:51:41,186
Yes.

1306
01:51:41,569 --> 01:51:44,909
It's a shame we don't have something
to protect us on our journey.

1307
01:51:45,238 --> 01:51:50,219
Oh I know, why don't you put your
lucky rock up on the dash, Tony?

1308
01:51:51,950 --> 01:51:56,470
C'mon Tony, we need all
the help we can get.

1309
01:52:00,909 --> 01:52:04,265
Thank you. I feel safer already.

1310
01:52:06,260 --> 01:52:08,960
You're a prick, you know that?

1311
01:52:32,020 --> 01:52:34,524
Ah, shit!

1312
01:52:43,354 --> 01:52:46,280
Goddamn cops.

1313
01:52:56,211 --> 01:53:00,591
- What are you doing out here?
- We're trying to get to New York.

1314
01:53:02,260 --> 01:53:05,780
- Is there a problem, Officer?
- Yeah.

1315
01:53:05,818 --> 01:53:10,782
I noticed your car was tilting to the left.
Looks like your back tire's flat.

1316
01:53:16,022 --> 01:53:17,518
Ah!

1317
01:53:25,481 --> 01:53:28,353
Keep it moving, keep it moving.

1318
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:43,554
OK. Be careful gentlemen.

1319
01:53:43,557 --> 01:53:48,521
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas! Thanks officer.

1320
01:53:59,699 --> 01:54:02,822
Weather advisory warning
this Christmas Eve, as a

1321
01:54:02,846 --> 01:54:05,820
major snowstorm is hitting
the eastern seaboard

1322
01:54:05,844 --> 01:54:09,029
with the severest weather
in eastern Pennsylvania,

1323
01:54:09,053 --> 01:54:11,812
northern New Jersey and
the five boroughs.

1324
01:54:11,836 --> 01:54:15,430
Travelers are advised to stay off
the Jersey Turnpike...

1325
01:54:15,454 --> 01:54:20,485
A'right. That's it. We're done. I'm
pulling us into the next motel.

1326
01:54:20,509 --> 01:54:24,635
- Keep going as long as you can go Tony.
- I can't keep my eyes open.

1327
01:54:24,806 --> 01:54:27,326
I'm getting hypnotized here.

1328
01:54:27,681 --> 01:54:30,443
I think my brain's
gonna explode.

1329
01:54:33,724 --> 01:54:36,236
Hey... we gave it a shot Doc.

1330
01:54:36,380 --> 01:54:38,478
What you gonna do?

1331
01:54:46,848 --> 01:54:50,899
Alright, the table is set, ladies and
gentlemen. Don't run in the house.

1332
01:55:46,304 --> 01:55:49,449
Tony. Tony, wake up.

1333
01:55:52,390 --> 01:55:56,629
- You alright?
- You're home, get inside.

1334
01:56:12,149 --> 01:56:13,622
Goodnight.

1335
01:56:14,219 --> 01:56:18,075
Wait, wait, come up,
meet my family...?

1336
01:56:20,659 --> 01:56:22,968
Merry Christmas Tony.

1337
01:56:27,547 --> 01:56:29,255
Merry Christmas!

1338
01:57:06,461 --> 01:57:09,380
Look who it is,
Shakespeare's home!

1339
01:57:17,990 --> 01:57:19,386
I made it back!

1340
01:57:22,412 --> 01:57:24,768
Tony, God bless you!

1341
01:57:37,890 --> 01:57:40,645
- You hungry?
- I'm starving.

1342
01:57:56,628 --> 01:58:00,087
- Welcome home, Dr. Shirley.
- Thank you, Amit.

1343
01:58:00,111 --> 01:58:03,571
I turned down your bed, sir.
Shall I unpack your luggage now?

1344
01:58:03,595 --> 01:58:06,990

1355
01:59:54,799 --> 01:59:57,295

last week when little Frankie

He was so funny up there.
