1
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,500
<i>Now, where to begin?</i>

2
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,000
<i>How 'bout, "Once upon a time"?</i>

3
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:29,199
<i>How many times have you heard</i>
<i>that to begin a story?</i>

4
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,899
<i>Let's do somethin' else.</i>
<i>I got it, I got it,</i>

5
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,799
<i>here we go.</i>
<i>Here's how to open a movie!</i>

6
00:00:36,098 --> 00:00:39,498
<i>No, I don't think so.</i>
<i>It sounds familiar. Doesn't it, to you?</i>

7
00:00:41,198 --> 00:00:42,498
<i>Oh, no, no, not the book.</i>

8
00:00:42,598 --> 00:00:44,898
<i>How many have seen</i>
<i>"opening the book" before?</i>

9
00:00:44,998 --> 00:00:47,898
<i>- Close the book. We're not doing that.</i>

10
00:00:47,998 --> 00:00:48,697
<i>Here's what we're gonna do.</i>

11
00:00:48,697 --> 00:00:49,397
<i>Here's what we're gonna do.</i>

12
00:00:49,497 --> 00:00:51,897
<i>Why don't I just go back to the day</i>

13
00:00:51,997 --> 00:00:54,997
<i>things took a turn for the worse?</i>

14
00:01:00,997 --> 00:01:04,296
Run for your lives!
Everyone run for cover!

15
00:01:04,296 --> 00:01:07,296
SOS! Mayday! Mayday!

16
00:01:07,296 --> 00:01:09,996
Code red! Duck and cover!

17
00:01:10,096 --> 00:01:11,496
You're all in danger!

18
00:01:11,596 --> 00:01:14,796
Ah!

19
00:01:18,494 --> 00:01:20,395
Run for cover!

20
00:01:22,494 --> 00:01:24,794
Run for your lives!

21
00:01:27,294 --> 00:01:28,994
Emergency! Emergency!

22
00:01:42,093 --> 00:01:43,393
Whoa!

23
00:01:46,993 --> 00:01:48,992
- Whoa!
- Aaah!

24
00:01:55,592 --> 00:01:58,491
Look out! Take cover!

25
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:19,090
Run for cover!

26
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,590
Chicken Little!
What is it? What's going on?

27
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,389
The sky is falling!
The sky is falling!

28
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:29,689
- The sky is falling?
- Are you crazy?

29
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:31,689
No, no, no!
It's true! Come with me!

30
00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:35,288
No. Son? What?

31
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:37,488
It happened under the old oak tree!

32
00:02:37,588 --> 00:02:39,288
I'm not making this up. It's here.

33
00:02:39,388 --> 00:02:42,188
There's a piece
of the sky somewhere...

34
00:02:42,288 --> 00:02:43,787
...somewhere on the ground.

35
00:02:43,787 --> 00:02:45,988
It was shaped like that!

36
00:02:46,088 --> 00:02:48,187
- It looks like a stop sign?
- Yes!

37
00:02:48,287 --> 00:02:52,087
Only it doesn't say "stop"
and it's blue and it has a cloud on it.

38
00:02:52,187 --> 00:02:54,187
And it hit me on the head!

39
00:02:54,287 --> 00:02:56,787
- It looked like a stop sign.
- Wait! What's that?

40
00:02:56,887 --> 00:02:58,887
- Son, is this what hit you?
- What?

41
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,586
Oh, no, Dad. It was
definitely a piece of the sky!

42
00:03:01,686 --> 00:03:03,786
Piece of the sky. It's OK, everyone!

43
00:03:03,886 --> 00:03:06,786
- Dad, no.
- There's been, like, a little mistake.

44
00:03:06,885 --> 00:03:10,485
It was just an acorn that-that
hit my son. A little acorn.

45
00:03:10,485 --> 00:03:11,985
- No! Dad, no.
- Quiet, son.

46
00:03:12,085 --> 00:03:14,185
This is embarrassing enough already.

47
00:03:14,285 --> 00:03:16,385
Chicken Little! What were you thinkin'?

48
00:03:16,485 --> 00:03:18,485
Why put your town's safety in jeopardy?

49
00:03:18,585 --> 00:03:20,884
How could you mistake
a stop sign for an acorn?

50
00:03:20,984 --> 00:03:24,784
- But it... a big acorn level fluh.
- What did he say?

51
00:03:24,884 --> 00:03:27,984
- A big acorn level fluh...
- It was a big acorn?

52
00:03:28,084 --> 00:03:32,184
- An ape throwing coleslaw?
- A big acorn level fluh...

53
00:03:32,284 --> 00:03:33,683
Gesundheit!

54
00:03:33,783 --> 00:03:36,084
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's just gibberish,

55
00:03:36,184 --> 00:03:39,283
- gibberish of an insane person.
- Come on, Buck!

56
00:03:39,283 --> 00:03:41,683
Your kid went
and scared us all half to death!

57
00:03:41,783 --> 00:03:44,883
Well, what can I tell you,
folks, my son,

58
00:03:44,983 --> 00:03:49,083
you know... Kids do crazy stuff.
You have kids. It's...

59
00:03:49,183 --> 00:03:52,582
No, Dad. It wasn't an acorn.

60
00:03:52,582 --> 00:03:55,682
It was... it was a piece of the sky.
Really, it was.

61
00:03:56,981 --> 00:03:58,882
You gotta believe me.

62
00:04:11,481 --> 00:04:14,780
A movie. A movie.

63
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,480
They're makin' a movie.

64
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,480
When? When will everybody
forget your big mistake?

65
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,480
When? When will everybody
forget your big mistake?

66
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,979
First it was all over the papers,
then they wrote a book about it,

67
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:26,579
then the book on tape,
then the board game,

68
00:04:26,679 --> 00:04:29,879
the spoons with your face on it...

69
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:31,479
...and the Web site,
the commemorative plates.

70
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:32,878
...and the Web site,
the commemorative plates.

71
00:04:32,978 --> 00:04:34,979
- You saw them, right?
- Yeah. I saw them.

72
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,478
Can't eat off 'em.

73
00:04:36,578 --> 00:04:39,378
- They're not microwave-safe.
- You saw the billboards?

74
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:40,978
I saw them.

75
00:04:42,977 --> 00:04:47,778
Ha! There's a bumper sticker.
I knew it was only a matter of time.

76
00:04:47,878 --> 00:04:51,277
Billboards I could live with.
Posters I could even live with.

77
00:04:51,277 --> 00:04:56,677
But a bumper sticker.
It's... it's like glued on forever.

78
00:04:56,777 --> 00:04:59,976
It doesn't matter. You know why?
Because I've got a plan.

79
00:05:00,076 --> 00:05:03,176
Yeah, about that.
Well, remember how I told you

80
00:05:03,276 --> 00:05:05,276
it would be better for you to lay low,

81
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,376
don't call attention to yourself?

82
00:05:07,376 --> 00:05:09,475
- Yes, but I...
- See, it's like a game.

83
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:11,176
Yeah, a game of hide-and-seek,

84
00:05:11,276 --> 00:05:14,675
except the goal
is never to be found, ever!

85
00:05:14,775 --> 00:05:16,275
Great!

86
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:18,674
Now, we've got a plan, right?

87
00:05:21,575 --> 00:05:25,974
I'll see ya later! Remember, lay low.

88
00:05:26,674 --> 00:05:28,674
Yeah. OK.

89
00:05:32,773 --> 00:05:34,274
Bye.

90
00:05:36,173 --> 00:05:38,273
Look, Mama! There's the crazy chicken!

91
00:05:38,373 --> 00:05:42,073
Yes, it is! Crazy chicken. You're so
smart. We don't make eye contact. Bye!

92
00:05:44,473 --> 00:05:48,073
That's it. Today is a new day.

93
00:07:41,163 --> 00:07:42,763
How's it going?

94
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:42,458
Ahem.

95
00:08:42,557 --> 00:08:45,258
- Very well. Foxy Loxy.
- Present, pretty, punctual.

96
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,157
Goosey Loosey.

97
00:08:47,157 --> 00:08:49,157
Master Runt of the Litter.

98
00:08:49,257 --> 00:08:53,257
Present and accounted for,
Mr. Woolensworth.

99
00:08:53,357 --> 00:08:55,157
Oop! Dropped my pencil!

100
00:08:55,956 --> 00:08:59,756
Whoa! Ahh!

101
00:08:59,856 --> 00:09:01,356
- Loser!
- Henny Penny.

102
00:09:01,456 --> 00:09:02,556
- Here.
- Ducky Lucky.

103
00:09:02,656 --> 00:09:03,756
- Here.
- Fuzzy Wuzzy.

104
00:09:03,856 --> 00:09:06,455
- Here.
- Morkubine Porcupine.

105
00:09:06,556 --> 00:09:08,955
- Yo.
- Fish Out of Water.

106
00:09:16,955 --> 00:09:19,654
Quite. Abby Mallard.

107
00:09:19,654 --> 00:09:20,755
Ugly duckling.

108
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,955
Class! I will not tolerate rude behavior

109
00:09:25,055 --> 00:09:28,554
- at the expense of a fellow...
- No worries, Mr. Woolensworth.

110
00:09:28,653 --> 00:09:31,154
Yah!

111
00:09:31,254 --> 00:09:35,154
You mustn't sneak up on me,
Ugly... uh, Abby.

112
00:09:35,253 --> 00:09:37,553
- Where was I?
- Ugly duckling.

113
00:09:37,653 --> 00:09:39,253
Oh, yes.

114
00:09:40,653 --> 00:09:42,552
Chicken Little.

115
00:09:43,453 --> 00:09:45,152
Hmm.

116
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:48,652
- Tardy again.
- Tardy again. Hmm.

117
00:09:48,752 --> 00:09:53,552
Class, turn to page 62
and translate each word in Mutton.

118
00:09:53,652 --> 00:09:56,051
- He.
- Baa.

119
00:09:56,151 --> 00:09:57,852
- She.
- Baa.

120
00:09:57,952 --> 00:09:59,851
- They.
- Baa.

121
00:09:59,951 --> 00:10:01,951
- We.
- Baa.

122
00:10:02,051 --> 00:10:03,351
OK, everyone. Listen up!

123
00:10:03,351 --> 00:10:04,651
OK, everyone. Listen up!

124
00:10:04,751 --> 00:10:07,651
I don't wanna hear any quacks,
tweets, oinks, whinnies

125
00:10:07,751 --> 00:10:12,850
or cocklee-doodle-doos
when I say... dodgeball.

126
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,850
Oh, man.

127
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,349
Pump it up! Pump it, pump it, pump it!

128
00:10:18,349 --> 00:10:21,649
Split into two teams.
Popular versus unpopular.

129
00:10:21,749 --> 00:10:23,449
- Coach?
- Yeah, unpopular?

130
00:10:23,449 --> 00:10:26,249
Shouldn't we review safety guidelines?

131
00:10:26,249 --> 00:10:28,649
Sure! Hit the pig, kids!

132
00:10:34,748 --> 00:10:36,048
Aaah!

133
00:10:37,948 --> 00:10:39,548
Look out!

134
00:10:39,648 --> 00:10:41,247
Calm down, Runt. Just...

135
00:10:41,347 --> 00:10:43,648
Just do what Fish is doing.

136
00:10:56,747 --> 00:10:57,946
Whew!

137
00:10:58,046 --> 00:11:00,447
- Tough morning?
- A run-in with my old nemesis.

138
00:11:00,547 --> 00:11:02,646
- Gum in the crosswalk?
- He won this round.

139
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:04,846
- Your old foe!
- Mm-hmm.

140
00:11:04,846 --> 00:11:07,545
- Incoming on your right.
- Thank you!

141
00:11:13,646 --> 00:11:15,645
Aah!

142
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:22,044
Yeah, I heard about
the movie. Tough break.

143
00:11:22,044 --> 00:11:24,644
- Yeah.
- Maybe it'll just go straight to video.

144
00:11:24,644 --> 00:11:26,644
That's the least of my problems.

145
00:11:26,744 --> 00:11:30,543
This morning... this morning my dad
told me I should basically disappear.

146
00:11:30,643 --> 00:11:32,344
But that's not gonna get me down.

147
00:11:32,344 --> 00:11:34,443
I've got a plan.
You want to hear about it?

148
00:11:34,543 --> 00:11:36,444
- Uh-oh.
- No, no, no! This one's good.

149
00:11:36,444 --> 00:11:39,443
Look, one moment destroyed
my life, right? One moment.

150
00:11:39,543 --> 00:11:41,143
- Warthog at 3:00!
- I see him!

151
00:11:43,043 --> 00:11:45,743
- Yes!
- So I figure all I need is a chance...

152
00:11:45,843 --> 00:11:48,542
All I need is a chance
to do something great

153
00:11:48,642 --> 00:11:52,042
to make everyone forget the
"sky falling" thing once and for all.

154
00:11:52,142 --> 00:11:54,942
And then my dad'll finally
have a reason to be proud of me.

155
00:11:55,042 --> 00:11:56,442
Time out!

156
00:11:59,442 --> 00:12:01,341
Nurse!

157
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:06,940
- Hi, Tiffany!
- Hey, man, what's goin' on?

158
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,141
So, what do you think?

159
00:12:09,241 --> 00:12:10,940
OK, listen.

160
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,841
You said the sky was falling.

161
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:15,240
- Your dad didn't support you.
- I...

162
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,240
And you have been hurting
inside ever since, right?

163
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,840
- It's hurt. It stung. OK?
- It's hurt, but... Yes.

164
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,939
- That's the nutshell.
- OK. Yes, but...

165
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:25,739
- No. Buh-buh...
- But, it's...

166
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,938
What's got to happen now
is the nut needs to be cracked open.

167
00:12:30,038 --> 00:12:32,739
And not one little chip
at a time, but... bam!

168
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:36,438
Smash! Bits of emotion flying
everywhere! Anger! Frustration!

169
00:12:36,438 --> 00:12:39,737
Denial! Fear!
Deep depression, in fact!

170
00:12:39,837 --> 00:12:41,238
You see what I'm saying?

171
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:43,837
Uh...

172
00:12:43,937 --> 00:12:46,937
All right, forget the nut part.
Here's the main thing.

173
00:12:47,037 --> 00:12:50,837
You have got to stop messing around,
and deal with the problem.

174
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,136
- OK, yes, but...
- Here's the real solution.

175
00:12:53,236 --> 00:12:55,737
You and your dad
talk-talk-talking... closure!

176
00:12:55,837 --> 00:12:56,936
- Closure?
- Closure,

177
00:12:57,036 --> 00:12:59,436
talking about something
until it's resolved.

178
00:12:59,536 --> 00:13:01,936
Wait! Hold on! See? Look.

179
00:13:02,036 --> 00:13:05,336
There's a whole section about it
in this month's <i>Modern Mallard.</i>

180
00:13:05,336 --> 00:13:08,736
- Incredibly appropriate!
- I told you, I have a plan.

181
00:13:08,836 --> 00:13:10,735
Yeah, but according to <i>Cosmo Duck,</i>

182
00:13:10,835 --> 00:13:13,535
you should
"stop the squawk and try the talk."

183
00:13:13,635 --> 00:13:15,235
<i>Beautiful Duckling</i> says,

184
00:13:15,235 --> 00:13:18,635
"Avoiding closure with your parents
can cause early molting."

185
00:13:18,735 --> 00:13:21,035
See? Closure.

186
00:13:21,035 --> 00:13:23,734
Repeat after me.
You, your dad, talk-talk...

187
00:13:23,834 --> 00:13:26,834
Abby, listen! Talking's a waste of time.

188
00:13:26,934 --> 00:13:30,434
I got to do something great so my dad
doesn't think I'm such a loser.

189
00:13:30,534 --> 00:13:32,533
Come on. You are not a loser.

190
00:13:32,633 --> 00:13:36,533
You're inventive and resourceful
and funny and cute and...

191
00:13:36,633 --> 00:13:38,033
What?

192
00:13:38,033 --> 00:13:42,532
Yeah... uh, Runt!

193
00:13:42,532 --> 00:13:46,132
Should Chicken Little have a good talk
with his dad and clear the air

194
00:13:46,232 --> 00:13:49,932
or keep searching for Band-Aid solutions
and never deal with the problem?

195
00:13:50,032 --> 00:13:52,031
Band-Aid solutions!

196
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:53,932
- Runt!
- Well, I'm sorry!

197
00:13:54,032 --> 00:13:56,031
I'm very bad at reading facial cues.

198
00:13:56,131 --> 00:13:57,732
Fish, help me out here.

199
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,430
Men.

200
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:16,430
'T was beauty that killed the beast.

201
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:21,330
I guess only girls are good at
honest communication and sensitivity.

202
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:26,429
That does it!
We were in a time-out, Foxy!

203
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:29,829
Prepare to hurt.
And I don't mean emotionally, like I do.

204
00:14:33,028 --> 00:14:34,229
Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow!

205
00:14:36,128 --> 00:14:38,528
Whoa!

206
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:47,328
We will save you!

207
00:14:48,227 --> 00:14:50,027
Fall back! Mad goose!

208
00:15:06,426 --> 00:15:08,625
Chicken Little!

209
00:15:08,725 --> 00:15:10,526
Not showing up for class,
inappropriate school attire,

210
00:15:10,526 --> 00:15:12,325
Not showing up for class,
inappropriate school attire,

211
00:15:12,325 --> 00:15:15,125
picking fights in gym class
and the fire alarm?

212
00:15:15,225 --> 00:15:19,525
Ever since that "sky falling" incident,
he's been nothing but trouble!

213
00:15:20,525 --> 00:15:23,424
Now look, Buck.

214
00:15:23,424 --> 00:15:26,124
You know I have
the utmost respect for you.

215
00:15:26,224 --> 00:15:28,724
I mean, you were Buck "Ace" Cluck,

216
00:15:28,824 --> 00:15:32,223
our school baseball star.

217
00:15:34,723 --> 00:15:37,723
But let's face the facts.

218
00:15:37,823 --> 00:15:41,923
Your kid, he's nothing like you at all.

219
00:15:42,923 --> 00:15:44,122
OK.

220
00:15:44,222 --> 00:15:48,322
Thank you for talking to me.
I'll take care of my son.

221
00:15:51,522 --> 00:15:53,721
I... Dad, it wasn't my fault.

222
00:15:53,821 --> 00:15:56,622
- It was Foxy. She's always...
- All right. It's fine.

223
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:59,521
You don't have to explain anything.

224
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,319
Uh...

225
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,719
Uh... Hey, Dad?

226
00:16:21,819 --> 00:16:26,818
I was thinkin'. Yeah, what if I?

227
00:16:26,918 --> 00:16:28,619
What if?

228
00:16:28,719 --> 00:16:31,018
What if I joined the baseball team?

229
00:16:31,118 --> 00:16:33,718
Hey, why don't you
watch where you're going?!

230
00:16:33,818 --> 00:16:35,918
Sorry, there, buddy! Sorry, sorry.

231
00:16:36,018 --> 00:16:39,718
Baseball? Son, we talked about this.

232
00:16:39,718 --> 00:16:42,518
Yeah, right. But, you know,
that was when I was small.

233
00:16:42,518 --> 00:16:46,218
I put on five ounces this year.
I've really bulked up.

234
00:16:46,318 --> 00:16:48,917
Really, son? Baseball. Are you sure?

235
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:51,817
Oh, yeah, yeah. I mean,
you know, hey, why not, right?

236
00:16:51,917 --> 00:16:53,916
- Yeah, why not, but why?
- Well, Dad,

237
00:16:54,016 --> 00:16:56,616
you were such a big
baseball star in high school.

238
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:58,316
You could give me some pointers.

239
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,816
But, son, you know,
I'm just wondering...

240
00:17:00,816 --> 00:17:05,016
Maybe baseball isn't exactly
your thing, you know?

241
00:17:05,116 --> 00:17:08,716
Have you considered
the chess team or the glee club?

242
00:17:08,816 --> 00:17:12,715
And some teenagers, you know, they
get quite a rush from stamp collecting.

243
00:17:12,715 --> 00:17:14,815
- No.
- Wanna stop? We'll get some stamps.

244
00:17:14,915 --> 00:17:17,515
- I don't like stamps.
- Colors, colorful things...

245
00:17:17,615 --> 00:17:19,115
No, I was thinkin' baseball!

246
00:17:19,215 --> 00:17:21,114
I can't wait to see
the look on your face

247
00:17:21,214 --> 00:17:23,314
when I smack that ball in
for a touchdown!

248
00:17:26,614 --> 00:17:29,213
Dad... Um, I'm kidding.

249
00:17:29,213 --> 00:17:31,014
That was a... that was a joke.

250
00:17:33,213 --> 00:17:35,614
Just do me one favor, son.

251
00:17:35,614 --> 00:17:37,913
Why, sure, Dad. Anything.

252
00:17:37,913 --> 00:17:42,113
Just please try not
to get your hopes too high.

253
00:17:42,213 --> 00:17:44,012
Yeah, but Dad, I mean, I...

254
00:17:45,413 --> 00:17:47,012
I mean, I think I can...

255
00:17:51,812 --> 00:17:53,412
I...

256
00:17:56,711 --> 00:17:58,112
OK, Dad.

257
00:18:47,307 --> 00:18:51,906
Oh, Chloe. If only you were here.

258
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:54,607
You'd know what to do.

259
00:19:18,004 --> 00:19:20,005
- That's my boy!
- Gee, thanks, Dad!

260
00:19:37,303 --> 00:19:41,602
Come on. All I need is a chance.

261
00:21:46,992 --> 00:21:48,692
<i>Lean to the left</i>
<i>Lean to the right</i>

262
00:21:48,792 --> 00:21:53,291
<i>C'mon Acorns</i>
<i>Fight, fight, fight! Go, Acorns!</i>

263
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:01,591
There's excitement
in the air, ladies and gentlemen.

264
00:22:01,691 --> 00:22:04,591
It's been two decades since
Oakey Oaks has beaten rivals

265
00:22:04,591 --> 00:22:06,390
the Spud Valley Taters.

266
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:09,790
Down by only a single run,
and with a player in scoring position,

267
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,890
we finally have a chance again.

268
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:15,789
This excitement isn't about the fun
of baseball, it's not about the prize.

269
00:22:15,889 --> 00:22:18,490
It's about gloating
and rubbing their noses in it,

270
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:21,590
the "Nah-nah-na-na-na!
We beat you!" taunting, if you will,

271
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:24,389
- that comes with the winning.
- Yeah!

272
00:22:26,589 --> 00:22:29,888
That's right. Oakey Oaks
and the Honorable Mayor Turkey Lurkey

273
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:33,688
will finally have bragging rights
again for one full year!

274
00:22:38,887 --> 00:22:41,987
But this battle has taken
a heavy toll on our hometown heroes.

275
00:22:41,987 --> 00:22:45,887
After nine grueling innings
and several players out with injuries,

276
00:22:45,987 --> 00:22:49,087
the Acorns are scraping
the bottom of the roster.

277
00:22:49,087 --> 00:22:53,487
Hopefully, there's just enough muscle
on the bench to pull out a win.

278
00:22:53,487 --> 00:22:57,286
Up next... Chicken Little.

279
00:23:00,586 --> 00:23:02,586
Clearly a long shot, folks.

280
00:23:02,686 --> 00:23:05,685
Little hasn't been up to bat
once since joining the team.

281
00:23:05,785 --> 00:23:08,485
- He's gonna lose the game for us!
- Wait!

282
00:23:08,585 --> 00:23:11,485
If he can get a walk
and advance to first, that powerhouse

283
00:23:11,585 --> 00:23:15,284
Foxy Loxy can step up and save us all.

284
00:23:15,384 --> 00:23:19,684
She's had a terrific game so far.
A shoo-in for the MVP trophy.

285
00:23:21,185 --> 00:23:22,484
OK, kid, listen up.

286
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:25,184
You have an itty-bitty,
teeny-tiny strike zone.

287
00:23:25,284 --> 00:23:28,583
There's no way he can throw you out!
Take the walk. Don't swing.

288
00:23:28,683 --> 00:23:31,383
- I have a good feeling...
- Look at me. Don't swing.

289
00:23:31,483 --> 00:23:33,883
Take the walk. You hear me?
Just take the walk!

290
00:23:33,883 --> 00:23:36,383
- But, coach, wait!
- Don't swing!

291
00:23:38,482 --> 00:23:41,482
Nervous, gangly,
barely able to hold the pine,

292
00:23:41,582 --> 00:23:44,682
Little advances to the box.
He's going to bat from the right.

293
00:23:44,782 --> 00:23:47,882
Make it the left. No, the right.

294
00:23:47,982 --> 00:23:50,182
- The right.
- Easy out!

295
00:23:50,282 --> 00:23:53,282
Left field's
found something better to do,

296
00:23:53,382 --> 00:23:56,081
center field's got a hunger pang
in his second stomach

297
00:23:56,081 --> 00:23:59,081
- and right field's digging for grubs.
- Play ball!

298
00:23:59,881 --> 00:24:01,381
Why him?

299
00:24:01,381 --> 00:24:04,280
Why now?

300
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:09,680
I won't embarrass you, Dad.
Not this time.

301
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,980
Here's the wind-up,
the pitch! It's a high cutter.

302
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,179
Ball!

303
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,379
Uh... Strike one!

304
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:24,679
I'm not going to sugarcoat it.
I've seen roadkill with faster reflexes.

305
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:27,878
The catcher lays down
the signals. Here's the pitch.

306
00:24:27,878 --> 00:24:30,079
Curve ball low and outside, he swings!

307
00:24:30,878 --> 00:24:33,079
Stee-rike two!

308
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:34,578
Ohh!

309
00:24:35,778 --> 00:24:37,978
I said, don't swing!

310
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:40,477
Don't swing!

311
00:24:40,577 --> 00:24:43,677
- No!
- Batter up!

312
00:24:46,577 --> 00:24:48,077
That's two in the hole!

313
00:24:48,177 --> 00:24:50,276
One more strike,
it's a punch out, folks,

314
00:24:50,276 --> 00:24:52,877
and we're all going home.

315
00:24:55,877 --> 00:24:58,376
Today is a new day.

316
00:25:06,076 --> 00:25:08,675
Don't swing!

317
00:25:19,075 --> 00:25:21,974
Well, take away my squeaky toy!
It's a hit!

318
00:25:21,974 --> 00:25:23,974
- A hit?
- A hit?

319
00:25:24,074 --> 00:25:25,674
A hit?

320
00:25:28,674 --> 00:25:31,473
The batter
is unbelievably at home plate.

321
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:33,873
He's standing in a daze. Run, kid, run!

322
00:25:33,873 --> 00:25:35,873
Go, son! Run! Run!

323
00:25:37,273 --> 00:25:38,273
Run!

324
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:42,972
There he goes,
the wrong way.

325
00:25:43,072 --> 00:25:45,172
- Wait, wait, wait!
- No, no! Not that way!

326
00:25:45,272 --> 00:25:48,372
- Run the other way!
- Turn around!

327
00:25:48,472 --> 00:25:51,772
He's turned!
I've never said these words before,

328
00:25:51,772 --> 00:25:53,871
but he's actually
rounding home plate!

329
00:25:53,871 --> 00:25:56,871
- Goosey steps on home...
- A new day!

330
00:25:56,871 --> 00:25:59,971
A tie game!
They're scrambling in the alley.

331
00:25:59,971 --> 00:26:03,070
Looks like Rodriguez has it.
Nope, it's the center fielder!

332
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:06,170
Mayhem in the outfield,
as Rodriguez is fired to second.

333
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:10,670
Catch is complete, but where's the ball?

334
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:13,670
Little touches the bag
and keeps going. A hunt for the rock.

335
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:16,569
The fielders are having trouble.
Commotion out there!

336
00:26:16,669 --> 00:26:19,569
- It's stuck! It's stuck!
- Tip the cow!

337
00:26:19,669 --> 00:26:21,869
It's the old
tip-the-cow play.

338
00:26:21,969 --> 00:26:24,469
He heads for the hot corner,
a stand-up triple!

339
00:26:24,469 --> 00:26:26,468
- Yes!
- Hold up! No!

340
00:26:26,568 --> 00:26:28,669
He's going for the whole enchilada!

341
00:26:28,769 --> 00:26:30,668
The ball of wax, kit and caboodle!

342
00:26:30,768 --> 00:26:32,868
Go back! You're never gonna make it!

343
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:35,968
Tries to lighten his load!

344
00:26:36,068 --> 00:26:38,468
The outfield behind,
Little's on all cylinders!

345
00:26:38,568 --> 00:26:39,667
He slides for the dish!

346
00:26:39,767 --> 00:26:43,767
It's going to be
a photo finish at home!

347
00:26:51,267 --> 00:26:52,766
You're out!

348
00:26:57,266 --> 00:27:00,366
Oh, folks.
Folks, what a heartbreaker.

349
00:27:00,466 --> 00:27:02,265
- Wait!
- Wait!

350
00:27:02,265 --> 00:27:05,265
Wait a cotton-picking second.
Hold your horses, here,

351
00:27:05,365 --> 00:27:09,165
and horses hold your breath.
This might not be over. He...

352
00:27:09,665 --> 00:27:12,265
He's...

353
00:27:12,365 --> 00:27:15,764
Safe! The runner is safe!

354
00:27:19,264 --> 00:27:21,465
It's all over, folks!

355
00:27:21,565 --> 00:27:24,064
The Acorns have done the impossible!

356
00:27:24,164 --> 00:27:26,864
For the first time in 20 years,
we won the pennant!

357
00:27:26,964 --> 00:27:31,663
Mothers, kiss your babies!
You've witnessed a miracle!

358
00:27:31,763 --> 00:27:34,963
Remember where you were at this
moment. The smells! The sounds!

359
00:27:35,063 --> 00:27:38,762
There's a new winner in town
and his name is Chicken Little!

360
00:27:38,762 --> 00:27:40,063
That was just a lucky hit!

361
00:27:40,163 --> 00:27:42,862
Yes,
Chicken Little, it's all yours!

362
00:27:42,862 --> 00:27:45,462
The victory, the triumph, the glory!

363
00:27:45,562 --> 00:27:48,862
And getting doused with a sticky drink
that soaks into your undies

364
00:27:48,962 --> 00:27:50,862
and chafes for hours!

365
00:27:50,862 --> 00:27:54,861
This is one memory you'll savor forever!

366
00:27:57,361 --> 00:27:58,761
Yeah!

367
00:28:00,461 --> 00:28:02,361
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

368
00:28:02,361 --> 00:28:06,460
Yes, yes, yes! We won! We won!
That's my boy out there!

369
00:28:06,561 --> 00:28:08,660
That's my boy!

370
00:28:51,056 --> 00:28:52,757
Yow!

371
00:28:52,757 --> 00:28:57,256
Here's the wind-up and the pitch!

372
00:28:57,256 --> 00:28:58,856
- A knuckleball!
- He swings!

373
00:28:58,956 --> 00:29:00,056
- Crack!
- It's going.

374
00:29:00,056 --> 00:29:02,856
- He rounds first, to second!
- Hits high off the wall!

375
00:29:02,856 --> 00:29:05,055
He flies past third
and heads for the plate!

376
00:29:05,155 --> 00:29:08,055
It's a scramble for the ball!
It's gonna be close!

377
00:29:08,155 --> 00:29:11,155
He is safe!

378
00:29:11,255 --> 00:29:13,455
- The mighty Acorns win!
- Yes! Acorns win!

379
00:29:13,554 --> 00:29:15,055
The mighty Acorns win!

380
00:29:15,055 --> 00:29:17,054
Yeah!

381
00:29:27,453 --> 00:29:29,754
Jeez, you know,

382
00:29:29,854 --> 00:29:33,154
I guess that puts the whole
"sky is falling" incident

383
00:29:33,254 --> 00:29:36,552
behind us once and for all. Hey, kiddo?

384
00:29:36,652 --> 00:29:38,753
You bet, Dad.

385
00:29:38,853 --> 00:29:42,053
I...

386
00:29:42,153 --> 00:29:46,052
Unless you think we need... closure?

387
00:29:46,052 --> 00:29:48,352
Closure? What's to close here?

388
00:29:48,452 --> 00:29:50,251
Unless you think we need to close...

389
00:29:50,351 --> 00:29:51,652
- Not me.
- It's closed!

390
00:29:51,652 --> 00:29:53,751
- I agree. Vacuum sealed.
- Shut tight!

391
00:29:53,751 --> 00:29:56,851
OK, great, Dad. You... Closure, I dunno.

392
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,551
All right. Enough fun.

393
00:30:05,651 --> 00:30:07,950
Good talk. Good talk, son.

394
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:13,950
- Here, I'll give you a push.
- Rock me a little. Help me.

395
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:16,549
- OK.
- OK, I'm up.

396
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,149
Hey.

397
00:30:22,349 --> 00:30:24,549
Good night, Ace.

398
00:30:25,749 --> 00:30:29,049
Here's the wind-up... and the pitch!

399
00:30:30,048 --> 00:30:31,248
Whoo-hoo!

400
00:30:44,447 --> 00:30:46,747
Thanks.

401
00:30:46,847 --> 00:30:48,847
Thanks for the chance.

402
00:31:16,544 --> 00:31:18,345
Oh...

403
00:31:27,444 --> 00:31:29,343
No!

404
00:31:30,643 --> 00:31:32,043
A piece of the sky?!

405
00:31:32,143 --> 00:31:34,743
Shaped like a stop sign?! Not again!

406
00:31:34,843 --> 00:31:36,943
Hey! Son!
You all right? I'm coming!

407
00:31:37,043 --> 00:31:39,642
I'm coming! I'm comin' upstairs!

408
00:31:39,742 --> 00:31:41,343
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

409
00:31:41,343 --> 00:31:43,342
You sure? I thought I heard you yell.

410
00:31:43,442 --> 00:31:44,643
No.

411
00:31:44,743 --> 00:31:46,442
Uh, I, uh...

412
00:31:46,542 --> 00:31:48,241
I fell out of bed.

413
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:51,741
Huh?

414
00:31:51,841 --> 00:31:53,842
- How'd you get over there?
- Over where?

415
00:31:53,842 --> 00:31:55,141
- There. There!
- Where?

416
00:31:55,241 --> 00:31:57,541
How'd you get over there?

417
00:31:57,641 --> 00:31:59,041
Who're we talking about?

418
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:05,740
Never mind. What's the difference?
Look, the past is behind us, right?

419
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,540
- Mmm.
- Tomorrow's gonna be a new day.

420
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,740
Please be gone,
please be gone, please be gone...

421
00:32:26,339 --> 00:32:27,938
Good.

422
00:32:33,838 --> 00:32:36,038
Ah!

423
00:32:46,237 --> 00:32:47,936
No.

424
00:33:09,735 --> 00:33:10,935
No.

425
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:25,334
I gotta call Abby!

426
00:33:30,433 --> 00:33:33,133
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.

427
00:34:01,931 --> 00:34:04,830
Hello! Mallard residence.

428
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:08,630
Runt! Quiet!
I'm on the phone!

429
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:12,330
Runt!

430
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:14,229
Oh...

431
00:34:16,529 --> 00:34:17,929
Hey! Where are you?

432
00:34:18,029 --> 00:34:21,329
- We already started. We were...
<i>- It opened up!</i>

433
00:34:21,329 --> 00:34:22,329
What?!

434
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:24,829
All right, guys.

435
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:26,528
Watch this.

436
00:34:28,829 --> 00:34:31,228
Bizarre.

437
00:34:31,328 --> 00:34:34,628
OK. Lemme guess.
You haven't told your dad yet.

438
00:34:34,728 --> 00:34:36,227
- Well...
- I knew it!

439
00:34:36,327 --> 00:34:38,728
Why haven't you told him?
There hasn't been

440
00:34:38,828 --> 00:34:41,828
- "you, your dad, talk-talk-talking."
- There was talking.

441
00:34:41,928 --> 00:34:45,527
- There was definitely talking.
- Really? What did he say?

442
00:34:45,627 --> 00:34:46,827
Uh...

443
00:34:48,627 --> 00:34:50,226
What?

444
00:34:50,326 --> 00:34:53,126
All right, that's it.
We are doing an intervention!

445
00:34:53,226 --> 00:34:56,326
You have got to stop messing around
and deal with the problem!

446
00:34:56,326 --> 00:34:57,926
- She's right!
- Abby, please.

447
00:34:58,026 --> 00:35:00,326
This is exactly what
fell on me the first time.

448
00:35:00,326 --> 00:35:02,625
There's no way I'm
bringing this up again.

449
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:03,925
- No, he's not.
- Runt!

450
00:35:04,025 --> 00:35:06,425
Sorry! I'm a gutless flip-flopper.

451
00:35:06,525 --> 00:35:10,125
OK. I'm sure there's
a simple, logical explanation.

452
00:35:10,225 --> 00:35:12,524
I mean, it could be
a piece of weather balloon,

453
00:35:12,624 --> 00:35:16,124
or maybe it's part of some
experimental communications satellite.

454
00:35:16,224 --> 00:35:18,924
I don't care. I want it
out of my life, gone for good.

455
00:35:19,024 --> 00:35:20,724
Everything back to normal.

456
00:35:22,523 --> 00:35:26,423
Hey, remember when
that icy blue stuff fell from the sky?

457
00:35:26,423 --> 00:35:29,023
Everybody thought it was
from space and stuff?

458
00:35:29,123 --> 00:35:33,623
And it just turned out to be
frozen pee from a jet airplane.

459
00:35:33,623 --> 00:35:36,423
Yeah, that's right. It's frozen pee.

460
00:35:36,523 --> 00:35:39,822
Yeah. It's frozen pee.
Pee, pee, pee, pee pee.

461
00:35:39,922 --> 00:35:42,322
- Could you stop saying that?
- What? Pee?

462
00:35:42,422 --> 00:35:43,622
- Pee.
- Tinkle?

463
00:35:43,722 --> 00:35:44,922
- Piddle? Wee-wee?
- Whiz?

464
00:35:45,022 --> 00:35:46,522
OK, subject change.

465
00:35:48,022 --> 00:35:50,422
- Make pishee?
- I don't care what it is!

466
00:35:52,521 --> 00:35:55,621
Are you gonna
help me get rid of it or not?

467
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:17,620
Flying Fish! Take cover!

468
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,019
Fish!

469
00:36:21,418 --> 00:36:22,919
- No!
- Fish!

470
00:36:32,918 --> 00:36:35,318
Aaah!

471
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,018
Come on, come on, come on!

472
00:36:37,418 --> 00:36:40,818
Wait, wait, whoa, son!
Where's the fire here?

473
00:36:41,417 --> 00:36:45,717
Chicken Little has something
to tell you! Tell him. He can handle it.

474
00:36:48,016 --> 00:36:49,617
Who're we talkin' about?

475
00:36:49,717 --> 00:36:51,716
Uh...

476
00:36:51,816 --> 00:36:53,116
Gotta go, Dad! Bye!

477
00:36:53,917 --> 00:36:56,816
Ha! You got to be ready
to listen to your children,

478
00:36:56,816 --> 00:36:59,416
even if they have nothing to say.

479
00:37:01,115 --> 00:37:04,715
- Sit tight, Fish!
- Fish! We will try to save you!

480
00:37:04,815 --> 00:37:06,715
Yeah!

481
00:37:11,114 --> 00:37:13,415
I'm sorry! Wait!

482
00:37:16,415 --> 00:37:17,614
Sorry!

483
00:37:18,514 --> 00:37:20,814
- Curb!
- Ay!

484
00:37:48,712 --> 00:37:50,511
Fish!

485
00:38:56,706 --> 00:38:58,006
Abby!

486
00:38:58,106 --> 00:38:59,805
Abby! Wake up!

487
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:04,105
Come on! Let's get outta here!

488
00:39:52,101 --> 00:39:53,401
Oh, poor Fish!

489
00:39:53,501 --> 00:39:57,201
He's probably stuffed and mounted
like an intergalactic trophy or...

490
00:39:57,201 --> 00:39:59,200
...maybe he's a half-living host

491
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:03,300
implanted with
their face-hugging embryo babies.

492
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,200
One thing's for sure, man. He's gone!

493
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:09,000
- Gone, man!
- Not yet!

494
00:40:12,999 --> 00:40:15,199
Oh, snap.

495
00:40:38,597 --> 00:40:40,497
Fish.

496
00:41:18,194 --> 00:41:21,594
Hey! What are you doing? Come on!

497
00:41:32,193 --> 00:41:34,092
Fish.

498
00:41:34,092 --> 00:41:36,093
Fish.

499
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:37,492
Fish.

500
00:41:37,392 --> 00:41:38,792
Fish.

501
00:41:38,792 --> 00:41:41,792
- Where are you, Fish?!
- Shh!

502
00:41:41,892 --> 00:41:44,392
I can't handle the pressure!
Go on without me!

503
00:41:44,492 --> 00:41:45,992
- Runt.
- You're just fine.

504
00:41:46,092 --> 00:41:48,391
I'll jeopardize the mission!
Endanger us all!

505
00:41:48,491 --> 00:41:51,091
Throw me overboard
while you still have a chance!

506
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:54,291
Just leave me some ammo, little water,

507
00:41:54,391 --> 00:41:55,791
some chips if you have 'em.

508
00:41:55,791 --> 00:41:57,490
Calm. OK, all right. Listen.

509
00:41:57,490 --> 00:41:59,491
- Where's your bag?
- Everything's OK.

510
00:41:59,591 --> 00:42:02,791
- Now breathe.
- Breathe.

511
00:42:02,891 --> 00:42:04,790
- No, slowly.
- Slowly.

512
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:06,190
Slowly.

513
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:10,689
OK. Now, just do the thing
you do to relax.

514
00:42:28,488 --> 00:42:29,589
Aaah!

515
00:42:40,187 --> 00:42:41,787
Fish!

516
00:42:42,787 --> 00:42:44,687
Fish! Are you OK?

517
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,586
Did they hurt you? Say something!

518
00:42:46,586 --> 00:42:49,387
Don't tap the glass.
They hate it when you do that.

519
00:42:49,387 --> 00:42:51,986
All right, let's get out of here.
Where's Runt?

520
00:43:18,884 --> 00:43:20,284
We're next.

521
00:43:22,983 --> 00:43:25,684
Run!

522
00:43:25,784 --> 00:43:27,183
OK! That's it!

523
00:43:27,183 --> 00:43:29,583
We're running back
to your house. Tell your dad!

524
00:43:29,683 --> 00:43:31,283
OK! You're right, you're right!

525
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:05,880
Oh, Runt!

526
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,680
Push! Push! No!

527
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:13,179
- Runt!
- No! Not pull! Push!

528
00:44:13,179 --> 00:44:15,779
We gotta get outta here
right now! Come on...

529
00:44:15,879 --> 00:44:18,580
No! Come on, you guys! Hu...

530
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:20,979
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

531
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:22,778
OK, time out!

532
00:44:22,878 --> 00:44:27,478
So... have
you been to the mall?

533
00:44:35,477 --> 00:44:37,478
Come on, buddy. Come on, buddy.

534
00:44:37,478 --> 00:44:38,777
I'm sorry.

535
00:44:38,777 --> 00:44:40,677
Tension makes me bloat.

536
00:44:48,776 --> 00:44:51,277
Come on, guys! Hurry, hurry, hurry!

537
00:45:22,774 --> 00:45:24,274
Look out!

538
00:45:24,274 --> 00:45:28,573
Thanks! Curse these
genetically tiny legs!

539
00:45:28,573 --> 00:45:31,473
Ohh! Aah!

540
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,869
What's that noise?

541
00:46:15,769 --> 00:46:18,069
Sorry. Nervous eater.

542
00:46:21,669 --> 00:46:24,368
- Run!
- Wait! Fish!

543
00:46:29,168 --> 00:46:31,068
The school bell! We've got to ring
the school bell to warn everyone!

544
00:46:31,068 --> 00:46:32,868
The school bell! We've got to ring
the school bell to warn everyone!

545
00:46:33,667 --> 00:46:34,968
Come on!

546
00:46:50,666 --> 00:46:52,666
Hurry! Hurry!

547
00:46:55,566 --> 00:46:56,865
Go! Go!

548
00:46:58,966 --> 00:47:00,465
Aaah!

549
00:47:18,364 --> 00:47:19,464
It's locked!

550
00:47:20,864 --> 00:47:22,264
They're... they're comin'.

551
00:47:26,963 --> 00:47:28,863
I need a soda.

552
00:47:30,863 --> 00:47:32,563
Come on, buddy. Come on, buddy!

553
00:47:32,663 --> 00:47:35,163
- The corner's wrinkled!
- Why are we doing this?

554
00:47:38,663 --> 00:47:40,962
Come on, take it, take it!

555
00:47:40,962 --> 00:47:42,162
Yes!

556
00:47:44,562 --> 00:47:46,361
Come on! Work! Work!

557
00:47:46,461 --> 00:47:48,962
Work! You work!

558
00:47:50,861 --> 00:47:53,661
What happened?
I blacked out there for a second.

559
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,261
Ah!

560
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:18,559
<i>The sky is falling!</i>
<i>The sky is falling!</i>

561
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:21,259
<i>It was just an acorn.</i>
<i>A little acorn!</i>

562
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:23,859
<i>I can't tell you</i>
<i>how embarrassed I am, folks.</i>

563
00:48:24,859 --> 00:48:27,158
Ring the bell!

564
00:48:28,258 --> 00:48:30,658
Come on, Chicken Little!
Ring the bell!

565
00:48:55,155 --> 00:49:00,856
Huh? What?
Oh!

566
00:49:00,956 --> 00:49:02,755
<i>Now the weather with Riz.</i>

567
00:49:02,855 --> 00:49:04,455
<i>A cold front is moving in so...</i>

568
00:49:04,455 --> 00:49:07,655
<i>The alarm bell has been activated!</i>
<i>Quick! Get a camera crew!</i>

569
00:49:24,554 --> 00:49:28,453
Chicken Little! You better have
a good explanation for this!

570
00:49:28,553 --> 00:49:31,752
There's, there's... It's a...
You have to... D'oh! Doo wah!

571
00:49:31,752 --> 00:49:33,053
What did he say?

572
00:49:33,153 --> 00:49:35,952
There's... It's a...
You have to... D'oh... Doo wah.

573
00:49:36,052 --> 00:49:40,252
Follow me! Come on!
Hurry! Hurry! Aliens here!

574
00:49:40,252 --> 00:49:42,252
Aliens here!

575
00:49:43,552 --> 00:49:46,252
It's... it's happening again.

576
00:49:46,352 --> 00:49:48,951
Come on! Hurry! Hurry!

577
00:49:51,851 --> 00:49:54,751
Come on. Come on.
You're about to see it!

578
00:49:57,551 --> 00:49:59,351
Quick! It's taking off!

579
00:49:59,451 --> 00:50:01,950
Come on! If you don't hurry,
you're gonna miss it!

580
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:04,151
Oh, look! A penny!

581
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:07,250
- Guys!
- Oh, right.

582
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:13,950
Hurry! Hurry!

583
00:50:15,349 --> 00:50:17,249
Come on! Quick! It's taking off!

584
00:50:17,349 --> 00:50:19,949
Come on! Hurry up!
Please! It's right in...

585
00:50:21,848 --> 00:50:23,249
What are we lookin' for?

586
00:50:23,749 --> 00:50:27,049
I don't know.

587
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:29,348
Uh, yeah. OK.
I know this looks bad,

588
00:50:29,448 --> 00:50:32,348
but there's an invisible
spaceship right there

589
00:50:32,448 --> 00:50:34,547
with aliens
who are here to invade Earth!

590
00:50:34,647 --> 00:50:36,948
Let me show you.

591
00:50:38,247 --> 00:50:39,347
Ooh, bad throw.

592
00:50:39,447 --> 00:50:41,447
OK, let me try again.

593
00:50:41,547 --> 00:50:44,246
- Bad throw.
- We all know I don't have a good arm,

594
00:50:44,246 --> 00:50:46,747
but there's these
cloaking panels on the bottom.

595
00:50:46,847 --> 00:50:50,546
They make it disappear. One fell out
of the sky and hit me right on the head.

596
00:50:50,646 --> 00:50:53,446
Oh, it's the acorn thing all over again.

597
00:50:53,546 --> 00:50:54,846
Eh, there's no story here.

598
00:50:54,946 --> 00:50:57,545
At least we can sell the video
to <i>Chickens Gone Wild.</i>

599
00:50:57,645 --> 00:51:01,145
- I'm telling ya, it was here!
- No, wait! There were aliens!

600
00:51:01,145 --> 00:51:04,645
It's true! They had eyes...
They're glowing and then tentacles!

601
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:07,745
And maps with planets
with X's through them! Aah!

602
00:51:07,845 --> 00:51:09,245
Runt, that's enough!

603
00:51:09,345 --> 00:51:12,345
Don't make Mommy take away
your Streisand collection!

604
00:51:12,445 --> 00:51:15,244
Mom? You leave Barbra out of this!

605
00:51:15,344 --> 00:51:18,944
Why can't you keep
that child of yours under control?

606
00:51:19,044 --> 00:51:20,443
What kind of parent are you?

607
00:51:20,543 --> 00:51:22,544
I'm telling the truth.

608
00:51:22,644 --> 00:51:27,343
Dad! Dad! I'm not making this up!

609
00:51:27,443 --> 00:51:29,942
You gotta believe me this time.

610
00:51:39,443 --> 00:51:42,942
No, son. I don't.

611
00:51:45,642 --> 00:51:49,542
I can't tell you
how embarrassed I am, folks.

612
00:51:49,542 --> 00:51:52,842
I'm really sorry about this, everyone.

613
00:51:52,842 --> 00:51:58,841
Looks like this is just
a big, crazy misunderstanding.

614
00:51:58,941 --> 00:52:03,440
Well, other than the penny,
this whole evening was a wash!

615
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:09,240
Mr. Cluck, don't take it
so hard. No one blames you.

616
00:53:21,534 --> 00:53:24,334
<i>Reports of panic</i>
<i>and mayhem are pouring in</i>

617
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:27,233
<i>after yet another Chicken Little</i>
<i>incident last night.</i>

618
00:53:27,233 --> 00:53:30,433
<i>In one instance, a family</i>
<i>of lemmings was sent running in fear,</i>

619
00:53:30,533 --> 00:53:33,933
<i>but unable to find a cliff, they</i>
<i>instead began throwing themselves</i>

620
00:53:35,132 --> 00:53:37,533
<i>- From the nearest park bench.</i>
- Hello? I'm sorry.

621
00:53:37,633 --> 00:53:39,832
Hello? I apologize.
Hello? Give me a break!

622
00:53:39,932 --> 00:53:42,532
What? You were trampled?
That's terrible.

623
00:53:42,632 --> 00:53:45,831
I thought rabbits' feet
were supposed to be lucky.

624
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:49,231
<i>- You have hate mail.</i>
- Sorry. That wasn't very funny.

625
00:53:49,331 --> 00:53:52,931
<i>- You have more hate mail.</i>
- Hi. What are you saying, sir?

626
00:53:52,931 --> 00:53:55,030
<i>Your hate mail box is full.</i>

627
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:58,430
Oh, yes. I do see the skywriting there.

628
00:53:58,430 --> 00:54:02,530
Thank goodness the cloud
blocked the last letter. Hello?

629
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:05,530
Hey! Watch your mouth. Yeah?

630
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:09,230
Oh, yeah? Well,
I'd like to see you try.

631
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:12,229
OK, I love you too, Mom. Bye.

632
00:54:12,229 --> 00:54:15,529
Hello? Really. Well...

633
00:54:31,828 --> 00:54:35,427
If there was ever a time
to talk to your dad...

634
00:54:35,527 --> 00:54:37,727
...it's now.

635
00:54:40,726 --> 00:54:42,527
It's too late for that.

636
00:54:44,026 --> 00:54:48,026
It's too late, baby, now it's too late.

637
00:54:48,126 --> 00:54:51,126
Though they
really did try to make it.

638
00:54:51,126 --> 00:54:52,726
Runt.

639
00:54:53,626 --> 00:54:55,126
Just think about it.

640
00:54:55,226 --> 00:54:58,925
Something inside has died
and they just can't hide

641
00:54:59,026 --> 00:55:03,726
and they just can't fake it. Oh, no, no.

642
00:55:07,324 --> 00:55:10,325
Runt, I really just want
to be alone right now.

643
00:55:19,424 --> 00:55:22,824
Oh! Abby! Runt! Fish!

644
00:55:22,924 --> 00:55:25,723
Look! There!
Look there! Look there!

645
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:27,823
- What is that thing?!
- Look at that!

646
00:55:37,222 --> 00:55:39,422
- His name is Kirby?
- They left him behind?

647
00:55:39,422 --> 00:55:41,122
Darth Vader is Luke's father?

648
00:55:43,122 --> 00:55:45,222
No, don't...
Come on, come on, don't cry.

649
00:55:45,222 --> 00:55:49,622
We're here for you. We're gonna do
whatever it takes to get you back home.

650
00:55:49,622 --> 00:55:52,321
Here, blow.

651
00:55:52,321 --> 00:55:54,821
OK.

652
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:05,720
See, guys? He's cool.
He was just freaked out. That's all.

653
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,720
Ah-choo!

654
00:56:58,616 --> 00:56:59,815
Whoa.

655
00:56:59,915 --> 00:57:00,915
Run!

656
00:57:13,114 --> 00:57:15,414
Those are your parents?

657
00:57:15,414 --> 00:57:18,114
And they brought the galactic armada?

658
00:57:22,113 --> 00:57:25,713
- Watch out for the kid! Don't hit him!
- There you are. Get in the car.

659
00:57:25,813 --> 00:57:27,613
- I gotta tell you something.
- What?

660
00:57:27,613 --> 00:57:31,013
I know, I know! You were right!
Alien invasion. I see that now.

661
00:57:31,113 --> 00:57:32,212
Look up! There it is!

662
00:57:32,212 --> 00:57:34,413
Dad, you know, about that...

663
00:57:34,513 --> 00:57:37,112
- It's actually a rescue mission.
- Rescue mission?

664
00:57:37,212 --> 00:57:40,012
This alien kid was left
and they're coming back to get him!

665
00:57:40,112 --> 00:57:42,812
We have to help him,
'cause if we don't, who else will?

666
00:57:42,812 --> 00:57:44,612
What?!

667
00:57:44,612 --> 00:57:45,711
Ugh!

668
00:57:45,811 --> 00:57:49,211
Forget it.
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

669
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:50,911
Son!

670
00:57:50,911 --> 00:57:54,910
Son, come back! Son! Chicken Little!

671
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:57,711
Mr. Cluck! Wait! He's telling the truth!

672
00:57:57,811 --> 00:57:58,910
He is!

673
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:01,910
Given his track record, we understand
why you don't believe him!

674
00:58:48,206 --> 00:58:53,006
Watch out for the kid! No! Don't!
Don't hit him! Don't hit... Look out!

675
00:59:09,205 --> 00:59:10,405
Whew!

676
00:59:16,204 --> 00:59:17,203
Chicken Little!

677
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:18,204
Chicken Little!

678
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:20,004
What? Where's your head?

679
00:59:20,104 --> 00:59:22,203
We gotta get outta here!
Come on! Come...

680
00:59:22,303 --> 00:59:25,003
- You, with the running and the jumping!
- Dad. No, wait.

681
00:59:25,003 --> 00:59:27,503
What are you guys doing?
We gotta get outta here!

682
00:59:27,503 --> 00:59:29,403
It's like <i>War of the Worlds</i> out there!

683
00:59:29,403 --> 00:59:31,903
- Stop pulling!
- Just listen to me for one second!

684
00:59:32,003 --> 00:59:34,202
- It's not dangerous!
- We are under attack!

685
00:59:34,302 --> 00:59:37,902
Will you two stop messing around
and deal with the problem?

686
00:59:40,301 --> 00:59:42,402
- You're never there for me!
- What?

687
00:59:42,502 --> 00:59:44,401
OK, that's not
what I had in mind, but...

688
00:59:44,501 --> 00:59:46,502
You're never there for me. I mean,

689
00:59:46,602 --> 00:59:49,702
you were when I won the game,
but not when I thought the sky fell.

690
00:59:49,802 --> 00:59:51,701
And not at the ball field and not now!

691
00:59:51,701 --> 00:59:53,600
This is good! Keep going. Keep going!

692
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:56,001
You've been ashamed
since the acorn thing.

693
00:59:56,001 --> 00:59:59,101
We have to talk because
<i>Modern Mallard</i> says avoiding closure

694
00:59:59,201 --> 01:00:01,200
can lead to molting. I'm already small

695
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,900
and I don't think
I could handle being bald!

696
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:07,399
I...

697
01:00:07,499 --> 01:00:10,899
I... I didn't...

698
01:00:10,999 --> 01:00:13,699
...realize, son.

699
01:00:13,799 --> 01:00:17,299
I-I never meant to...

700
01:00:17,399 --> 01:00:20,498
The acorn, the sky, I mean, the whole...

701
01:00:23,398 --> 01:00:26,299
You're right. You're right.

702
01:00:32,498 --> 01:00:35,498
Y... Your mom, she was...

703
01:00:35,598 --> 01:00:39,596
You know, she was always good
with stuff like this.

704
01:00:42,996 --> 01:00:45,997
Me...

705
01:00:45,997 --> 01:00:48,296
...I'm gonna need a lot of work.

706
01:00:50,496 --> 01:00:53,095
But you need to know that I love you,

707
01:00:53,296 --> 01:00:55,896
no matter what.

708
01:00:55,995 --> 01:00:58,396
And I'm sorry I...

709
01:01:02,295 --> 01:01:06,494
And I'm sorry if I ever made
you feel like that was something...

710
01:01:07,295 --> 01:01:09,494
...you had to earn.

711
01:01:20,694 --> 01:01:22,393
Uh... uh...

712
01:01:25,394 --> 01:01:27,593
And we're good. Let's go. Let's go.

713
01:01:27,693 --> 01:01:29,592
OK, Dad.

714
01:01:29,693 --> 01:01:30,893
All we gotta do
is return helpless little Kirby.

715
01:01:30,893 --> 01:01:32,093
All we gotta do
is return helpless little Kirby.

716
01:01:36,292 --> 01:01:38,792
Return this whatever it is?

717
01:01:38,792 --> 01:01:41,592
This is crazy! Crazy!

718
01:01:41,592 --> 01:01:43,392
Crazy wonderful!

719
01:01:43,492 --> 01:01:45,491
Just tell me what you need me to do.

720
01:01:45,591 --> 01:01:49,091
- Do you really mean it?
- You bet! Anything, son.

721
01:01:50,391 --> 01:01:53,791
Come on, Dad.
We've got a planet to save!

722
01:01:55,690 --> 01:01:58,890
Crazy supportive. That's me! Ohh!

723
01:01:58,890 --> 01:02:02,190
This thing likes to nibble,
doesn't it?

724
01:02:05,089 --> 01:02:08,989
By the way, I'd like to say I've
always found you extremely attractive!

725
01:02:16,989 --> 01:02:20,889
Now that's closure.

726
01:02:24,088 --> 01:02:26,888
Wait! Wait! What's goin' on?!

727
01:02:31,088 --> 01:02:34,588
Oh, they've given her
an alien mind-wipe!

728
01:02:34,687 --> 01:02:36,287
Aaah!

729
01:02:37,187 --> 01:02:38,887
OK, son. What do we do now?

730
01:02:38,987 --> 01:02:40,787
Uh, OK. This is a piece of cake, Dad.

731
01:02:40,887 --> 01:02:44,586
All we have to do is take the kid down
the street to the giant metal alien.

732
01:02:46,686 --> 01:02:49,986
We surrender! Here!
Take the key to the city!

733
01:02:49,986 --> 01:02:52,186
Key to my car?

734
01:02:52,186 --> 01:02:54,785
Tic Tac?

735
01:02:56,686 --> 01:02:58,685
Forget plan A!

736
01:03:00,586 --> 01:03:03,385
Uh-oh.

737
01:03:15,384 --> 01:03:17,084
OK, OK, what now, son?

738
01:03:17,184 --> 01:03:19,584
Who, by the way, I support 100 percent.

739
01:03:19,684 --> 01:03:22,883
- Uh, plan B?
- Ha-ha! Of course! Plan B!

740
01:03:22,883 --> 01:03:25,683
What is plan B?

741
01:03:25,783 --> 01:03:28,383
What? You have to go
to the bathroom? You want juice?

742
01:03:28,483 --> 01:03:30,483
A snack? Corn dog on a stick?

743
01:03:30,583 --> 01:03:32,783
Want to play some golf?
What do you want?!

744
01:03:32,783 --> 01:03:35,082
I stink at this. I'm a horrible father.

745
01:03:35,182 --> 01:03:37,482
No, no, I am.

746
01:03:39,882 --> 01:03:42,082
Poo-tee-tah.

747
01:03:43,582 --> 01:03:45,081
Oh. Is that your parents?

748
01:03:45,181 --> 01:03:47,181
Pooteetah, pooteetah.

749
01:03:47,181 --> 01:03:49,081
That's it, Dad! Plan B!

750
01:03:49,081 --> 01:03:52,281
All we have to do is weave
through traffic through town square

751
01:03:52,381 --> 01:03:54,680
while avoiding death rays
from alien robots.

752
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:56,980
We get to Town Hall,
climb up to the roof

753
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:58,980
and give the kid back to its parents.

754
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:03,180
Yeah!

755
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:06,280
Charge!

756
01:04:13,079 --> 01:04:15,279
Wow!

757
01:04:26,677 --> 01:04:28,878
A-ha!

758
01:04:28,978 --> 01:04:32,478
Now that's what I call
takin' out the trash!

759
01:04:41,777 --> 01:04:43,776
OK, son. Now what?

760
01:04:43,776 --> 01:04:45,077
Fire truck!

761
01:04:49,876 --> 01:04:51,876
Plan C!

762
01:04:55,676 --> 01:04:57,975
Runt, no! Turn around!

763
01:04:57,975 --> 01:05:01,075
- Go back to Town Hall!
- But they'll vaporize us!

764
01:05:02,675 --> 01:05:05,975
- You want me to do what?
- Runt, just do it! It'll work!

765
01:05:05,975 --> 01:05:07,975
We'll survive!

766
01:05:09,075 --> 01:05:11,774
I will survive?

767
01:05:11,874 --> 01:05:13,574
Brake, Abby!

768
01:05:13,674 --> 01:05:15,374
OK.

769
01:05:15,973 --> 01:05:18,474
- Floor it!
- Boink.

770
01:05:22,074 --> 01:05:24,273
Deploy ladder, Fish!

771
01:05:42,571 --> 01:05:44,472
- Plan D.
- Plan D!

772
01:05:44,572 --> 01:05:46,071
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

773
01:05:46,171 --> 01:05:49,671
Thighs hurting.
Drumsticks burning.

774
01:05:49,671 --> 01:05:52,870
But loving you!

775
01:05:52,970 --> 01:05:54,371
Full support!

776
01:06:03,370 --> 01:06:05,969
I can't get out! Come back, son!

777
01:06:06,069 --> 01:06:08,070
We can't go out this way!
It's dangerous.

778
01:06:08,170 --> 01:06:10,469
- No, Dad, I can do this!
- It's too dangerous.

779
01:06:10,469 --> 01:06:12,569
I can do this. I can.

780
01:06:13,669 --> 01:06:15,969
You gotta believe me this time.

781
01:06:16,069 --> 01:06:17,569
I...

782
01:06:20,068 --> 01:06:21,968
I do, son.

783
01:06:23,768 --> 01:06:26,468
OK, hang on tight.

784
01:06:34,468 --> 01:06:38,167
- Yes!
- Here's your kid! Look over here!

785
01:06:38,167 --> 01:06:39,867
Here's your kid!

786
01:06:39,967 --> 01:06:41,666
He's OK!

787
01:06:48,166 --> 01:06:51,465
He's all right!
Stop the invasion!

788
01:06:52,466 --> 01:06:54,466
Son! Son!

789
01:06:56,866 --> 01:06:59,165
Aaaah!

790
01:07:02,765 --> 01:07:06,065
- I'm here, son!
- Dad! Look out!

791
01:07:06,165 --> 01:07:09,064
Get away from my boy! Get away!

792
01:07:15,064 --> 01:07:17,763
The mighty Acorns...

793
01:07:27,263 --> 01:07:29,363
Tic Tac?

794
01:07:31,562 --> 01:07:34,262
Why did you take our child?

795
01:07:34,362 --> 01:07:37,962
Hey, hey! Just...
Just hold on there, buddy!

796
01:07:38,062 --> 01:07:40,262
My son did not take your kid!

797
01:07:40,362 --> 01:07:42,262
You were the one
that left him behind!

798
01:07:42,262 --> 01:07:45,061
That's bad parenting! And I should know!

799
01:07:45,161 --> 01:07:47,262
Silence!

800
01:07:48,461 --> 01:07:50,461
Release the child!

801
01:07:50,461 --> 01:07:52,661
- OK.
- OK, OK.

802
01:07:56,261 --> 01:08:00,760
Sweetheart! Oh, Kirby,
I'm so happy to see you! My darling!

803
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:03,760
- That was close.
- At least they're back together.

804
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:05,360
They got their kid.

805
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:09,460
You have violated
intergalactic law 90210!

806
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:14,559
A charge punishable
by immediate particle disintegration!

807
01:08:18,058 --> 01:08:19,959
Oh, snap.

808
01:08:22,458 --> 01:08:24,758
Hmm? What's that?

809
01:08:24,858 --> 01:08:26,158
Hmm. I...

810
01:08:26,258 --> 01:08:28,558
I don't quite...

811
01:08:28,658 --> 01:08:32,158
Melvin, honey?
He's saying they're telling the truth.

812
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:34,057
It was just a misunderstanding.

813
01:08:36,658 --> 01:08:39,357
Well, then. This is awkward.

814
01:08:39,457 --> 01:08:41,357
- Yes, it is.
- I suppose I should...

815
01:08:41,457 --> 01:08:44,156
- Put the big guns away?
- Yes, yes.

816
01:08:44,256 --> 01:08:47,056
- Now put them down.
- Of course.

817
01:08:49,156 --> 01:08:51,956
- And turn off your big voice.
- But I don't...

818
01:08:51,956 --> 01:08:53,455
- Turn it off.
- But...

819
01:08:53,555 --> 01:08:55,856
But I don't get to use
the big voice very often!

820
01:08:55,956 --> 01:08:57,455
Melvin.

821
01:08:57,555 --> 01:08:59,756
Yes, dear.

822
01:09:03,855 --> 01:09:08,054
Hi. Uh, anyone want
to try the big voice?

823
01:09:11,554 --> 01:09:15,154
Again,
I cannot tell you how sorry we are

824
01:09:15,254 --> 01:09:16,953
for this whole misunderstanding.

825
01:09:17,053 --> 01:09:19,454
Oh, dear goodness.
We are so very sorry.

826
01:09:19,454 --> 01:09:21,953
We are. And if it hadn't
been for your son there,

827
01:09:21,953 --> 01:09:24,753
well, we might have
vaporized the whole planet.

828
01:09:24,753 --> 01:09:25,953
What?

829
01:09:26,053 --> 01:09:28,253
Goodness! What a shame
that would have been.

830
01:09:28,353 --> 01:09:30,252
Where else would we pick our acorns?

831
01:09:30,252 --> 01:09:32,952
- We stop on the way to the in-laws.
- Every year.

832
01:09:32,952 --> 01:09:36,152
Looked on all the other planets.
You only find them on Earth.

833
01:09:36,252 --> 01:09:39,052
Just as it says here
on your primitive graphic display.

834
01:09:39,152 --> 01:09:41,352
That caught our eyes.

835
01:09:41,352 --> 01:09:44,151
OK, everything's been
put back to normal,

836
01:09:44,151 --> 01:09:46,351
except for this one, over here.

837
01:09:46,451 --> 01:09:47,951
Hi, y'all!

838
01:09:48,051 --> 01:09:49,251
Foxy?

839
01:09:53,350 --> 01:09:56,850
She got her brainwaves
scrambled during reconstitution.

840
01:09:56,950 --> 01:09:59,250
No worries! We can put
her back the way she was.

841
01:09:59,350 --> 01:10:01,850
No! She's perfect.

842
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:06,349
- Scary.
- Whoops!

843
01:10:06,349 --> 01:10:08,949
Darling! Look at the time!
We better get a move on.

844
01:10:09,549 --> 01:10:11,849
All right, then.
It was good meetin' ya.

845
01:10:11,950 --> 01:10:14,749
Sorry for the whole
full-scale invasion thing.

846
01:10:14,849 --> 01:10:18,349
But, hey, I'm a dad.
You know how it is with your kids.

847
01:10:18,349 --> 01:10:22,448
When they need ya,
you do whatever it takes.

848
01:10:24,848 --> 01:10:28,548
There goes that panel again.

849
01:10:28,647 --> 01:10:30,648
Every year we come,
this thing falls off.

850
01:10:30,748 --> 01:10:33,447
Someday it's going
to hit somebody on the head.

851
01:10:33,547 --> 01:10:35,247
Nonsense!

852
01:10:35,247 --> 01:10:36,747
You can't return the panel.

853
01:10:36,847 --> 01:10:39,947
- Now that's ridiculous.
- You threw away the receipt again.

854
01:10:40,047 --> 01:10:41,547
Silence!

855
01:10:41,547 --> 01:10:44,747
Melvin, did you just try
and use the big voice on me?

856
01:10:44,747 --> 01:10:47,646
Um... uh...

857
01:10:47,746 --> 01:10:49,646
Who we talkin' about?

858
01:10:52,045 --> 01:10:53,846
So I'd like to see the movie
they make about you now.

859
01:10:53,946 --> 01:10:55,645
So I'd like to see the movie
they make about you now.

860
01:10:55,845 --> 01:10:58,345
I just hope they stay true
to what really happened.

861
01:10:58,345 --> 01:10:59,745
Oh, son, these people
are from Hollywood!

862
01:10:59,845 --> 01:11:01,145
Oh, son, these people
are from Hollywood!

863
01:11:01,245 --> 01:11:03,245
One thing they'll never do

864
01:11:03,345 --> 01:11:04,844
is mess with a good story.

865
01:11:04,944 --> 01:11:06,344
Is mess with a good story.

866
01:11:08,544 --> 01:11:10,744
Red alert!
Man your battle stations!

867
01:11:10,744 --> 01:11:13,444
Status report, Mr. Fish.

868
01:11:13,544 --> 01:11:15,944
Commander Little,
the evil Foxloxian Army

869
01:11:16,044 --> 01:11:18,543
has broken through
the planet's atmosphere.

870
01:11:18,543 --> 01:11:21,044
But that means...

871
01:11:21,044 --> 01:11:25,243
Yes, I know. The sky... is falling.

872
01:11:25,243 --> 01:11:26,943
Commander Little! No!

873
01:11:27,043 --> 01:11:30,043
Please... call me...

874
01:11:30,143 --> 01:11:31,342
...Ace.

875
01:11:31,442 --> 01:11:33,142
Oh, Ace! No!

876
01:11:33,242 --> 01:11:37,542
I never intended to
bring you into this... Abby.

877
01:11:37,642 --> 01:11:39,942
- Runt, do you copy?
<i>- Yes, commander?</i>

878
01:11:40,042 --> 01:11:44,142
Runt, my friend, an alien fleet
is about to invade Earth.

879
01:11:44,242 --> 01:11:47,841
Civilization as we know it depends on me

880
01:11:47,941 --> 01:11:51,540
and, to a lesser extent... you.

881
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:55,240
So I've just got one question for you:

882
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:57,740
Are you ready to rock?

883
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:02,340
Ain't no mountain high enough,
ain't no valley low...

884
01:12:05,239 --> 01:12:08,439
Raise your pork shield,
Runt. Prepare to engage.

885
01:12:12,839 --> 01:12:15,239
<i>Stay on target. Stay on target!</i>

886
01:12:15,339 --> 01:12:17,938
<i>Give 'em a taste</i>
<i>of the other white meat!</i>

887
01:12:18,038 --> 01:12:20,339
<i>- Cap'n! Look out!</i>

888
01:12:20,339 --> 01:12:21,338
<i>Runt!</i>

889
01:12:21,438 --> 01:12:22,938
<i>Runt, are you all right?</i>

890
01:12:23,038 --> 01:12:27,137
<i>No, no. Ya gotta</i>
<i>go on without me, commander.</i>

891
01:12:29,038 --> 01:12:33,038
<i>Just leave me some ammo, a little water,</i>

892
01:12:33,138 --> 01:12:35,037
<i>some chips if you have 'em.</i>

893
01:12:35,137 --> 01:12:37,937
This is amazingly accurate.

894
01:12:40,936 --> 01:12:43,836
<i>He was my good friend.</i>

895
01:12:43,936 --> 01:12:45,636
<i>Oh, Abby.</i>

896
01:12:45,636 --> 01:12:49,236
<i>At least I still have you... Abby.</i>

897
01:12:49,336 --> 01:12:51,336
<i>- Ace!</i>
<i>- Abby.</i>

898
01:12:51,436 --> 01:12:54,935
<i>- Ace!</i>
<i>- Abby.</i>

899
01:12:55,035 --> 01:12:56,935
<i>Ace!</i>

900
01:12:58,135 --> 01:13:00,435
<i>Good people of Oakey Oaks.</i>

901
01:13:00,535 --> 01:13:05,135
<i>Though at times it may feel</i>
<i>like the sky is falling around you,</i>

902
01:13:05,135 --> 01:13:06,535
<i>never give up.</i>

903
01:13:06,634 --> 01:13:11,134
<i>For every day... is a new day!</i>

904
01:13:11,234 --> 01:13:14,234
<i>A new day!</i>

905
01:13:19,134 --> 01:13:20,633
<i>Oh, Ace!</i>

906
01:15:33,622 --> 01:15:35,422
Come on, Runt. You can do it.

907
01:15:35,522 --> 01:15:39,122
<i>I won't go breaking your heart</i>

908
01:15:41,122 --> 01:15:44,721
You got to act quickly, Dad. Try this.

909
01:15:44,821 --> 01:15:46,621
There you go!

910
01:15:46,721 --> 01:15:48,521
There it is!

911
01:15:50,521 --> 01:15:53,721
I'm having fun now!

912
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:59,220
That was great!

913
01:15:59,420 --> 01:16:02,020
Let's sing it again!
