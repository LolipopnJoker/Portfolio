1
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,510
Good morning, James.

2
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,790
How are you feeling?

3
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,070
Wait. What?

4
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,230
It's perfectly normal to feel confused.

5
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,870
You just spent 120 years
in suspended animation.

6
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,470
What?

7
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,270
It's okay, James.

8
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,830
-  It's Jim.
- Jim.

9
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,640
Just breathe. Everything is okay.

10
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,030
Where am I?

11
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,190
You're a passenger on the Starship Avalon,

12
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:53,910
the Homestead Company's
premier interstellar starliner.

13
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,630
We've nearly completed the voyage
from Earth to your new home.

14
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,070
The colony world of Homestead II.

15
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,920
A new world. A fresh start.

16
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,510
Room to grow.

17
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,270
 Oh, yeah.

18
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,390
The Avalon is on final approach.

19
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,550
For the next four months,
you'll enjoy space travel

20
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,510
at its most luxurious.

21
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,510
Food. Fun. Friends.

22
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,030
- My friends.
- That's right, Jim.

23
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:23,470
The ID band on your wrist is your key
to the wonders of the Avalon.

24
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,830
You're in perfect health, Jim.

25
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,430
Let's get you to your cabin,
where you can get some rest.

26
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,840
You may be experiencing

27
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,310
post-hibernation sickness.

28
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,910
Your door will illuminate for you.

29
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,480
Welcome to your cabin,

30
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,870
your home until we make landfall.

31
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,070
Over the next four months,

32
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,040
you'll prepare for your new life
on Homestead II,

33
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,590
meet your fellow passengers,
take skill-building classes,

34
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,550
and learn about colonial living.

35
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,470
You've been assigned to learning group 38

36
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,670
for passengers with engineering
and technical trade skills.

37
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,470
Please scan your ID
to confirm luggage delivery.

38
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,350
Jim.

39
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,110
Please scan your ID
to confirm luggage delivery.

40
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:26,270
To help you recover from hibernation,
be sure to drink plenty of fluids.

41
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,510
Enjoy the rest of your
voyage on the Avalon,

42
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,750
a Homestead Company Starship.

43
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,830
Good morning, one and all.

44
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,550
It's a beautiful morning
here on the Starship Avalon.

45
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,360
Whatever you do, don't get homesick,
get Homestead.

46
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,760
Let's start things off
with one of my favorites back on Earth.

47
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:47,110
 Once upon a time
You dressed so fine

48
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,550
Threw the bums a dime in your prime

49
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,520
Didn't you?

50
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,040
No.

51
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,480
 That's stupid.

52
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:04,510
Just own it. Own it, Jim.
You got a cool jacket.

53
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,470
Hello, passengers.

54
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,110
Will you all please take a seat.

55
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:27,400
Welcome, learning group 38.

56
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:30,150
Your introduction to colonial life.

57
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:34,390
Earth is a prosperous planet,
the cradle of civilization.

58
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:39,630
But for many, it's also overpopulated,
overpriced, overrated.

59
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,390
I'm sorry, I think I may be in the wrong...

60
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,270
Hold all questions till the end, please.

61
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,390
Oh, sorry.

62
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,360
The colonies offer an alternative,
a better way of life.

63
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,590
Where are all the other...

64
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:53,720
And there's no colony
more beautiful than Homestead II,

65
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,710
the jewel of the occupied world.

66
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,150
 I'm sorry.

67
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,430
Where is everybody?

68
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,950
We are all on the Starship Avalon.

69
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,390
But I'm the only one here.

70
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:06,600
There are 5,000 passengers
and 258 crew members.

71
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,350
So why am I alone?

72
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,710
We're all in this together.

73
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,870
Hello?

74
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,160
Anybody here?

75
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,000
Hello?

76
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:33,000
Please buckle up
and secure any loose items.

77
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:36,790
This elevator will experience
a momentary lapse in gravity.

78
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,710
Grand concourse.

79
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,790
Hello.

80
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,950
Welcome to the grand concourse
aboard the Avalon.

81
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,230
Can I help you?

82
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:23,030
I need to talk to a person.

83
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,760
A real live person, please?

84
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,030
What sort of person?
Personal trainer? Travel planner?

85
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,720
- Therapist?
- I... I don't know.

86
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,190
Somebody in charge.

87
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,070
The ship's steward
handles passenger affairs.

88
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,270
It's on level three of the grand concourse.

89
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,030
- Thank you.
- Happy to help.

90
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,750
Not good.

91
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,760
- Hello.
- Who's flying the ship?

92
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,760
The flight crew, the captain, the pilot,
the chief navigator...

93
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,870
Captain. I want to speak to the captain.

94
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,790
The captain rarely handles
passenger queries...

95
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,630
It's an emergency! Please.

96
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:56,390
The captain is usually found on
the bridge, in the command ring.

97
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,790
Bridge access requires
special authorization.

98
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:14,640
Bridge access requires
special authorization.

99
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,910
 You got to be kidding me.

100
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,550
Welcome to the observatory.

101
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,990
What can I show you?

102
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,190
We're supposed to land soon.

103
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,840
I'm... I'm the only one awake.

104
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,510
I don't understand. What can I show you?

105
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,600
Show me Homestead II.

106
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:56,710
Homestead II is the fourth planet
in the Bhakti System.

107
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,270
Right. And where are we?

108
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:02,350
We're in transit from
Earth to Homestead II.

109
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:05,270
We will arrive in approximately 90 years.

110
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,350
What?

111
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:09,790
We arrive at Homestead II
in 90 years, three weeks and one day.

112
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,030
No. Wait.

113
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,710
How long ago did we leave Earth?

114
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:15,270
Approximately 30 years ago.

115
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,590
I woke up too soon.

116
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,950
Hello.

117
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,640
How do I send a message to Earth?

118
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:29,110
Interstellar messages are
sent by laser array.

119
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,630
This is an expensive service.

120
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,390
- Bite me.
- Happy to help.

121
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,590
Planet and connection?

122
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,750
Earth. The Homestead Company.

123
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:43,230
There are 30,826 contacts
listed under Homestead Company.

124
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,870
I'm emigrating to Homestead II
and I have an emergency.

125
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,150
I have a customer help line.

126
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,230
Sounds about right.

127
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,630
Begin message.

128
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,680
Hi. Uh, I'm Jim Preston.

129
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,990
I'm a passenger on the Avalon.

130
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,150
I, uh...

131
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:05,070
I think something went wrong
with my hibernation pod.

132
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,510
I woke up too soon.

133
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:10,270
And I mean, way too soon.

134
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:13,000
Nobody else is awake, and...

135
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,310
I don't know how to get back to sleep.

136
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:18,510
And the thing is, there's 90 years to go.

137
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,360
At this rate, I'm...

138
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,310
I'm sorry, I'm trying to fix this.

139
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:33,430
Maybe I missed something.
I could use a hand.

140
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,470
That's all.

141
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,310
Thank you.

142
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,240
Message sent.

143
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,430
Outstanding.

144
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,790
Message will arrive in 19 years.

145
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:46,990
Wait, what?

146
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,230
Earliest reply in 55 years.

147
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,790
 Fifty-five years?

148
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,150
We apologize for the delay.

149
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,750
That will be $6,012.

150
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:08,360
 Call me irresponsible

151
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,590
- Afternoon.
- Oh, man!

152
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,750
Is it good to see another face!

153
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,680
Thought I was the only one awake.

154
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,870
Who wants to sleep
on a beautiful day like this?

155
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,870
No, I mean we're in trouble.
We're not supposed to be here.

156
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,990
Well, I won't tell if you don't.

157
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,710
- Huh?
- Our little secret.

158
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,630
What can I get for you?

159
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:31,830
What?

160
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,390
You look like a whiskey man.

161
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,470
Uh, okay.

162
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,790
Oh, you're a robot.

163
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,710
Android. Technically.

164
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,310
Arthur's the name.

165
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,790
- Jim.
- Pleased to meet you, Jim.

166
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,550
How much do you know about this ship?

167
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,520
I don't know.

168
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,670
I know some things.

169
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,190
What do I do
if my hibernation pod malfunctions?

170
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,750
Oh, hibernation pods are fail-safe.

171
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,160
They never malfunction.

172
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,430
Well, I woke up early.

173
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,950
Can't happen.

174
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,470
How long until we get to Homestead II?

175
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,390
About 90 years or so.

176
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,480
And when are all the passengers
supposed to wake up?

177
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,350
Not till the last four months.

178
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,510
How is it that I'm sitting here with you

179
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,790
with 90 years to go?

180
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,750
Hmm?

181
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,750
It's not possible for you to be here.

182
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,150
Well, I am.

183
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:43,520
Good morning.
It's a beautiful day here on the Avalon.

184
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,870
So wake up, sunshine.
It's time to relax and enjoy your stay.

185
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,830
Please make a selection.

186
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:05,800
Sorry. The Mocha Cappuccino Extreme
is reserved for gold-class passengers.

187
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,440
Sorry. The Mocha Cappuccino Extreme
is reserved for...

188
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,950
I want the Mocha Cappuccino Extreme.

189
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,030
Bill my room, please.

190
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,680
Food can be purchased in the ship's...

191
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,240
Sorry. The French Roast...

192
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,670
Sorry. The Pumpkin Spice...

193
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,350
Sorry. Vanilla Chai...

194
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,710
Sorry. Sorry.

195
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,830
Sorry.

196
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:21,910
Large coffee.

197
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,950
- Cream...
- Please enjoy your coffee.

198
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,470
Oh, really?

199
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:50,470
Crew pod room access
requires special authorization.

200
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,550
 Grand...

201
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:36,630
Going...

202
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,510
Please make... Level...

203
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,150
Grand concourse.

204
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,350
I'm screwed, Arthur.

205
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,030
Completely and ridiculously screwed.

206
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,440
Come on, now.

207
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:49,550
Every cloud has a silver lining.

208
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:54,600
Guess I am gonna die of
old age on this ship.

209
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,150
Oh, we all die.

210
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,270
Even androids end up on the scrap heap.

211
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,270
I'm your only customer.
Why are you always polishing a glass?

212
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,880
Trick of the trade.

213
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,600
Makes people nervous
when a bartender just stands there.

214
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,240
So lay some bartender wisdom on me.

215
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,110
I'm lost in space here.

216
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,910
You're not where you want to be.

217
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,510
You feel like you're supposed
to be somewhere else.

218
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,030
You said it.

219
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,870
Well, say you could snap your fingers

220
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,390
and be wherever you wanted to be.

221
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,230
I bet you'd still feel this way.

222
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,030
Not in the right place.

223
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:35,910
Point is, you can't get so hung up
on where you'd rather be

224
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,230
that you forget how to make
the most of where you are.

225
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,350
What are you telling me?

226
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:43,470
Take a break from worrying
about what you can't control.

227
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,310
Live a little.

228
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,110
 Live a little.

229
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:00,760
Welcome to the Vienna Suite.

230
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,830
Oh.

231
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,520
Oh, yeah.

232
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,510
Huh.

233
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,790
 What?

234
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,920
Ah!

235
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,350
- Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
- Yeah!

236
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,950
Make that a double jumbo shrimp.

237
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:23,350
Triple.

238
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:25,710
Dance-off.

239
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,470
 All right.

240
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,790
I did exactly what you just did.

241
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,750
Large coffee.

242
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,880
You have had many, señor.

243
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,630
Sí, señor.

244
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,230
Gracias.

245
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,590
Come on, come on

246
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:59,240
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

247
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:04,600
 A little less conversation
A little more action, please

248
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:08,430
Get out of here!

249
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,310
Come back. Hey.

250
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,070
Come here.

251
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,360
Welcome, Jim.

252
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,120
Please turn your attention

253
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:18,430
to the screens displaying safety tips.

254
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:22,790
These spacesuits are designed to withstand
the harsh environment of space.

255
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:25,070
The carbon fiber and polyamide construction

256
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:28,510
means your suit is both
flexible and durable.

257
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:43,680
Remember,
your spacesuit is your lifeline.

258
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:56,670
Slide the handle on the right
to release the air pressure.

259
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,310
Your magnetic boots are now engaged.

260
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,600
They can be deactivated
using the control panel on your arm.

261
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,270
Press the red button
to open the airlock door.

262
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,030
Have a wonderful time.

263
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,590
Tether attached.

264
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,630
Welcome back, Jim.

265
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:56,430
We hope you decide to join us again soon

266
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,870
for another thrilling experience.

267
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:24,790
Have a wonderful time.

268
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:47,000
 Aurora.

269
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,790
Searching passenger profiles.

270
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,830
I'm Aurora Lane.

271
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:55,880
Passenger 1456. I'm a writer.

272
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:57,680
I think we tell each other stories

273
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:00,430
to know we're not alone, to make contact.

274
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:04,030
Your father was Oliver Lane,
a Pulitzer Prize-winning author.

275
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:05,390
No pressure, right?

276
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:08,870
My dad used to say,
"If you live an ordinary life,

277
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:11,230
"all you'll have are ordinary stories.

278
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,470
"You have to live a life of adventure."

279
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,510
So...

280
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:17,670
Here I am.

281
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,280
Good morning.

282
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:31,760
We're starting over in every way.

283
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:35,000
I'll have to figure out
where to live, how to live,

284
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,590
Who my friends will be.

285
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,000
It's like the first day of school.

286
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,270
If the school bus took 120
years to get there.

287
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:45,230
We're creating a culture...

288
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,430
You are funny.

289
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:49,240
Do you ever read something
and feel like it's written just for you?

290
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,830
I don't do a lot of reading.

291
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,670
She's good.

292
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,920
Who's that?

293
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,110
- Aurora.
- Ah...

294
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,030
The sleeping girl.

295
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,150
You know, I'm not saying
the universe is evil,

296
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:09,030
but it sure has a nasty sense of humor.

297
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,110
How is that?

298
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:12,710
You get to fly to another planet,

299
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:15,270
but you'll die along the way.

300
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,830
And you find the perfect woman

301
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,910
right in front of you...

302
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,870
Yet she's completely out of reach.

303
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:30,190
Yeah, I'll miss New York City.

304
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,880
Give me a cup of coffee
and a view of the Chrysler Building,

305
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,150
and I can write all day.

306
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,720
They do have coffee on Homestead II, right?

307
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,790
They better have coffee.

308
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:40,230
If they don't, I have to turn around
and come back to Earth.

309
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:43,470
Is there anything
you regret leaving behind?

310
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:48,230
Yeah, I'll miss the trees
in Central Park turning in the fall.

311
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,070
 I'll also miss crowds...

312
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,550
Say you were trapped on a desert island,

313
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:05,880
and you had the power
to wish somebody there with you.

314
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,750
You wouldn't be alone anymore.

315
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:10,870
But you'd be stranding the person
on the island.

316
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:13,390
How do... Would you make that wish?

317
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,830
I don't know. I've never been on an island.

318
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:17,560
Okay, well, yeah.

319
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,560
Uh... Forget the island.

320
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:25,070
Let's say you figured out
how to do something

321
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,440
that would make your life
a million times better,

322
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:30,070
but you knew it was wrong
and there's no taking it back.

323
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,230
How do you do the math?

324
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:33,670
Jim, these are not robot questions.

325
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:41,670
I know how to wake Aurora up.

326
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:44,480
Oh. Well, that seems like a fine idea.

327
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,630
You could use some company.

328
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:48,430
I'd be stranding her on this ship
for the rest of her life.

329
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,710
Oh. Well, you can't do that.

330
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,470
What am I gonna do?

331
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:55,030
I'm here for you.

332
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,910
Arthur, you're a machine.

333
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:04,270
See? You can't feel that.
You don't have feelings.

334
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,310
See?

335
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:10,070
That doesn't hurt.

336
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:12,150
And you don't even mind.

337
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:15,270
 'Cause you're not a person.

338
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:23,390
 Don't even think about it.

339
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,880
No more Aurora talk.

340
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:26,390
I'm over it.

341
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:27,910
I'm moving on.

342
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:31,070
 Don't even think about it!

343
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:33,080
What am I gonna do?
I'm just gonna sit and think about it?

344
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,640
I'm not... I can't think about it,
so I'm not going to.

345
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:36,510
That's the deal. I've made my decision.

346
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:37,590
I know what I'm doing.

347
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,470
 I just cut it off.

348
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,040
 I'm not... No more.

349
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,680
You won't hear me bring up her name again.

350
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,270
I'll never even mention her name again.

351
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:47,430
Done.

352
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:52,150
 You can't do it.

353
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,750
Shaving off my beard.

354
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:11,510
Please don't do it.

355
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,390
Good morning, Aurora.

356
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:07,630
How are you feeling?

357
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:10,520
It's perfectly normal to feel confused.

358
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:13,710
You just spent 120 years
in suspended animation.

359
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:04,150
Grand concourse.

360
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,670
Hello?

361
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:10,430
Anybody?

362
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,310
Hello.

363
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,190
Hi.

364
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,350
Are you passenger or crew?

365
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:34,230
Passenger.

366
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,470
Jim Preston.

367
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:37,200
Aurora Lane.

368
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,390
Do you know what's going on?

369
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,390
Nobody else from my row woke up.

370
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:44,790
Same for me.

371
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:47,590
The crew's supposed to wake up
a month before we do,

372
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:49,430
but I haven't seen anybody.

373
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,840
The crew is still asleep.

374
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,630
Are you saying nobody's awake?

375
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,390
Just me.

376
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,910
Just you?

377
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,350
It's just us.

378
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:06,710
But somebody's got to land the ship
in a few weeks.

379
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:10,830
We will arrive in approximately 89 years.

380
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:13,070
Eighty-nine years?

381
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:18,230
The other passengers aren't late waking up.

382
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:21,390
We were early.

383
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:28,270
We... We need help.

384
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:29,590
Where's the crew?

385
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:32,910
The crew's in a secure
hibernation room.

386
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:36,270
Everything important, the controls,
the reactors, the engines...

387
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:37,950
It's all behind firewalls.

388
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,710
There's no way through.

389
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:52,430
How long have you been awake?

390
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,830
A year and three weeks.

391
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:58,320
 No. No, no, no.

392
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,590
No, this can't be happening.

393
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:03,150
We have to go back to sleep.

394
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,160
Aurora, we can't.

395
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:11,310
We just have to get back to our pods
and start them up again.

396
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:15,240
 I can't find my pod.
I can't find my pod.

397
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:17,550
I can't find my pod. I don't know which...

398
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:19,120
It doesn't matter.

399
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,760
- Aurora...
- I can't find it!

400
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,640
- Stop. Aurora...
- I can't find which one is mine!

401
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,320
- Stop.
- I don't know which one is mine!

402
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:26,510
- I'll help you.
- I can't...

403
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:29,070
Stop! It doesn't matter.

404
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:35,030
Putting somebody into hibernation
requires special equipment.

405
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,590
Remember the facility
where they put us under,

406
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:40,030
all the procedures we went through?

407
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:42,390
These pods are designed
to keep us in hibernation,

408
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,990
to wake us up at the right time,

409
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,710
but they can't put us back to sleep.

410
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:48,670
You don't think there's a way
back into hibernation?

411
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,550
No.

412
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,200
But there has to be.

413
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,470
There has to be.

414
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:07,110
9:00. Nighttime.

415
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:15,030
I know I should be
working the problem, but...

416
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,470
I can't even keep my eyes open.

417
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:20,430
You just came out of hibernation.

418
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:22,950
It's going to be a couple of days
before you're 100%.

419
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,470
You should get some rest.

420
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:27,270
Think I'm gonna have to.

421
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:29,960
I'll walk you to your cabin.

422
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:32,550
No, it's okay. I'll be all right.

423
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:34,430
Okay.

424
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,350
Good night, Aurora.

425
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:43,190
 More than a year?

426
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:45,070
I can't imagine.

427
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,310
It must have been so hard for you.

428
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,870
 It was.

429
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:51,390
Good night, Jim.

430
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:56,270
Please buckle up and secure
any loose items.

431
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:01,910
- Whiskey, neat.
- Sure thing.

432
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:09,070
How's your day been?

433
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:12,070
 Aurora's awake.

434
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:13,950
Congratulations.

435
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:17,710
You don't look happy.

436
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:23,560
Arthur, can you keep a secret?

437
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,160
Jim...

438
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:27,800
I'm not just a bartender, I'm a gentleman.

439
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:30,750
Don't tell Aurora that I woke her up.

440
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:35,550
She thinks it was an accident.
Let me tell her.

441
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,200
Of course.

442
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:53,120
How can there be no way
to put someone back into hibernation?

443
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,560
What if a pod breaks down?

444
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,390
No hibernation pod has malfunctioned

445
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:58,750
in thousands of interstellar flights.

446
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:02,000
Well, I'm awake.

447
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:04,350
Hibernation pods are fail-safe.

448
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:06,230
Good morning.

449
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:09,230
- Have you eaten?
- No. I'm starving.

450
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:11,630
And this is the dumbest machine.

451
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,270
Happy to help.

452
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:27,990
Gold-class breakfast.

453
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,150
Well, you're a man of simple tastes.

454
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:42,910
I'm not a gold-class passenger.

455
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:47,350
French breakfast puffs above my pay grade.

456
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:48,920
What? This whole time?

457
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:50,750
-  Yeah.
- What can I get you?

458
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:52,790
- No. No, I'm fine.
- Stop it.

459
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,670
Really. Okay.

460
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:57,720
Here you go.

461
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:03,630
Yeah.

462
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:07,430
So, I was thinking,
maybe there's another way to go to sleep.

463
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:08,710
What about the infirmary?

464
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:11,190
I checked it out.
It's just scanners and an Autodoc.

465
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:13,710
There could be another hibernation machine
in the cargo hold.

466
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:14,910
I had that thought, too.

467
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,320
And then I read the manifest.

468
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:18,390
It's mostly farming stuff,
machines and trade goods.

469
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:21,110
Replacement parts
for computers and engineering.

470
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:23,550
We're not gonna find
a hibernation facility in a box.

471
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:25,350
- We could build our own.
- We can't.

472
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:26,550
Jim, you're not even trying.

473
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:28,910
I have tried everything.

474
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,990
For over a year, I...

475
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,350
I tried everything.

476
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:34,870
 Well...

477
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,030
Well, I'm not ready to give up.

478
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:49,190
Infirmary.

479
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:59,750
What about research articles?
Any kind of technical documents.

480
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:02,430
Hibernation technology is proprietary.

481
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:06,230
The following articles deal with the
subject on a theoretical level.

482
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:51,830
New file. My voyage.

483
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:56,670
I boarded the Avalon with an idea,
a destination.

484
00:40:57,470 --> 00:41:00,830
Both now out of reach.

485
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:04,840
I've been awake for seven days.

486
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:07,910
Awake far too soon.

487
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:10,510
And I may well spend the
rest of my life here,

488
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:15,110
in a steel world 1,000 meters long.

489
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:20,870
There's another passenger awake,
a mechanic named Jim Preston.

490
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:25,680
He seems to have accepted our fate.

491
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:28,350
But I'm scared.

492
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:30,960
I'm fighting to stay calm.

493
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:36,190
All the other passengers will sleep

494
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:38,270
for another 90 years

495
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:42,110
while I live out my life on this ship,

496
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:44,590
traveling forever...

497
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:47,430
Never arriving...

498
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:50,750
My only companion a total stranger.

499
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:01,070
Why did you do it?

500
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:04,790
Do what?

501
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:08,910
Emigrate. Leave Earth.

502
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:11,520
I'm interviewing you.

503
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:12,550
You're what?

504
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:16,230
You were the first hibernation failure
in the history of space travel.

505
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:17,390
That makes you a story.

506
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:19,800
Who you gonna tell?

507
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,030
Posterity.

508
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:23,920
So, why did you give up your life on Earth?

509
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:28,310
120-year space hibernation means
you'll never see your family or friends again.

510
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:32,720
You'll wake up in a new century
on a new planet.

511
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:34,510
It's the ultimate geographical suicide.

512
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:37,350
Well, I could ask you the same thing.

513
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:39,270
But it's my interview.

514
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:41,550
Were you running away from something?

515
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:43,280
No.

516
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:45,670
- Everything was okay.
- So?

517
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:47,240
Well, I guess I just wanted a new world,

518
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:48,430
I don't know, a fresh start.

519
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:50,510
That's Homestead Company advertising.

520
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:52,000
- Is it?
- Jim.

521
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:53,950
I... I know. I guess. You're right.

522
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:02,280
Back on Earth, when something breaks,
you don't fix it, you replace it.

523
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:05,880
The colonies, they have problems to solve.

524
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:07,790
They're my kind of problems.

525
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:11,590
And a mechanic is somebody.

526
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:13,870
This is a new world still being built.

527
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:18,270
I could build a house and live in it.

528
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:25,800
Open country. Room to grow.

529
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:27,350
Now you're back to slogans.

530
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:29,190
Can't slogans be true?

531
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:32,480
Do you know how much
Homestead Company

532
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:34,590
made off its first planet?

533
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:36,750
Eight quadrillion dollars.

534
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:39,560
That's eight million billions.

535
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:42,030
Colony planets
are the biggest business going.

536
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:44,150
Did you pay full price for your ticket?

537
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:46,590
No. I'm in a desirable trade.

538
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:51,230
So they fill your head with dreams,
discount your ticket,

539
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:53,190
and you fly off to populate their planet

540
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:55,390
and give Homestead
20% of everything that you make

541
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:56,510
for the rest of your life.

542
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:59,670
Not to mention the debt you run up
on this fancy starship.

543
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:01,830
So all you see here is 5,000 suckers?

544
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:06,350
I see zeros
on the Homestead Company's bottom line.

545
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:09,720
I see 5,000 men and women
changing their lives.

546
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:13,310
For 5,000 different reasons.
You don't know these people.

547
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:16,080
I'm a journalist. I know people.

548
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:18,750
Really?

549
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:20,510
This one.

550
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:23,470
Is he a banker, a teacher or a gardener?

551
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:26,870
- Banker.
- He's a gardener.

552
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:31,070
And her. Is she a...

553
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:33,920
Madison, Donna or a Lola?

554
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:37,310
Donna's too serious for that hair.

555
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:38,390
Lola.

556
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:41,270
- Madison.
- Shit!

557
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:46,470
All right, chef, accountant or midwife?

558
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:47,750
She has to be a midwife.

559
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:49,440
There's no way you just made that one up.

560
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:50,510
Yeah. She's a midwife.

561
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:54,390
I didn't know they still had midwives.

562
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:59,030
I like her. We'd be friends.

563
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:01,350
You think you can see that?

564
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:02,840
Don't you?

565
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:06,190
I do.

566
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:08,830
- A round-trip ticket?
- That's right.

567
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:11,310
I was gonna fly to Homestead II,
live for a year,

568
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:12,720
and then right back to Earth.

569
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:16,430
I don't get it. I left Earth for a new life,
but you end up back where you started?

570
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:18,160
I end up in the future.

571
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:20,430
Two hundred and fifty years in the future,

572
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:23,270
on Earth, which is still
the center of civilization,

573
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:24,590
like it or not.

574
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:28,910
And I'll be the only writer to ever travel
to a colony world and come back.

575
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:30,910
I'll have a story no one else can tell.

576
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:32,520
What story?

577
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:34,910
Humanity's flight to the stars.

578
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:36,950
The greatest migration in human history.

579
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:38,680
It's the biggest story there is.

580
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:41,000
But you won't know
any of the people who are reading it.

581
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:42,520
But they'd be reading it.

582
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:46,270
Or they would have been.

583
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:49,270
I'll never write it now.

584
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:51,440
I don't know if I'll ever write again.

585
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:56,920
Jim, I can't think of anything else to try

586
00:45:57,830 --> 00:45:59,400
to save us.

587
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:03,790
And I don't even want to
think about it anymore.

588
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:07,630
What is there to do around here?

589
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:12,870
- Are you serious?
- Dead serious.

590
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:15,910
- Partner mode.
- Let's get it on!

591
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:18,430
Come on, get in power mode.

592
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:26,680
You just stand here.

593
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,160
And then we repeat what they do.

594
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:38,470
Uh, is there anything else we can do?

595
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:39,750
- Just do the...
- Okay.

596
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:41,200
- You don't have to.
- Okay. I can...

597
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:43,070
- Beat down!
- Hey!

598
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:45,390
Here we go. Let's see it. Oh!

599
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:47,400
Whoa! Whoa! Oh.

600
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:48,840
Oh!

601
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:50,790
- Why you smiling?
- Aurora! Aurora!

602
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:52,520
 'Cause I'm up two points.

603
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:54,270
Who's the lovely lady?

604
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:55,590
This is Aurora.

605
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:58,070
Aurora. A pleasure.

606
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:02,310
-  I can't!
- You did great!

607
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:04,590
Okay, one more time.
One more time, let's see it.

608
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:11,830
Oh!

609
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:17,670
- Yes!
- Whoo!

610
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:22,870
I swear, I didn't
wear pants for a month.

611
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:25,550
Seven weeks and two days, to be exact.

612
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:26,870
The man has no shame.

613
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:29,430
Well, you're a little lacking
in that area yourself, Arthur.

614
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:34,430
I laughed at the man with no pants

615
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:36,630
until I realized I have no legs.

616
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:45,550
For a minute,
I almost forgot my life is in ruins.

617
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:47,190
 I'm sorry.

618
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:49,350
What for?

619
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:52,240
I'm gonna go to bed.

620
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:54,070
Good night.

621
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:55,750
- All right.
- Good night, Aurora.

622
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:00,870
She is wonderful.

623
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:04,070
Excellent choice.

624
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:32,550
Hello.

625
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:34,350
Hi.

626
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:35,990
Here you go.

627
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:44,190
Is he asking me on a date?

628
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:48,150
Do you need a pen?

629
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:02,550
She didn't seem that impressed.

630
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:22,830
"Love to." She wrote, "Love to."

631
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:32,480
You have a visitor.

632
00:50:51,070 --> 00:50:52,350
Wow.

633
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:54,550
You clean up pretty good yourself.

634
00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:56,310
You went shopping.

635
00:50:56,430 --> 00:50:58,750
I went shoplifting.

636
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:04,190
Evening.

637
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:05,750
What can I get for you?

638
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:07,830
I'll have a Manhattan, please.

639
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:11,110
- Whiskey, rocks.
- Coming up.

640
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:21,000
You two look fine this evening.

641
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:23,870
Thank you, Arthur. We're on a date.

642
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:25,760
Very nice.

643
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:28,310
Took you long enough to ask.

644
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,120
I was giving you space.

645
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:33,110
Space.

646
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:35,510
The one thing I do not need more of.

647
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:43,310
That was so good.

648
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:44,910
It wasn't easy getting a reservation.

649
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:47,710
They're probably gonna want us
to give up our table.

650
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:49,120
- Mmm-hmm.
- I'm getting a lot of dirty looks.

651
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:51,030
Very popular tonight.

652
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:54,190
So how's your book coming?

653
00:51:54,430 --> 00:51:56,390
I don't really know what it is yet.

654
00:51:57,550 --> 00:51:59,550
My dad, he used to always
write about his life,

655
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:01,240
but he had stories.

656
00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:04,150
He'd sailed around Antarctica.

657
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:06,390
He was a war reporter.

658
00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:08,710
He had lovers.

659
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:10,470
He wrote about his daughter.

660
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:12,270
He wrote about you?

661
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:14,910
Yeah. I grew up reading
about myself in his books.

662
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:15,990
How was that?

663
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:18,550
Not always easy.

664
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:21,350
A little more than you wanted
to know about yourself.

665
00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:24,600
And then, when I was 17,

666
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:26,920
he had a heart attack.

667
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:29,870
Right at his keypad.

668
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:32,280
End of story.

669
00:52:35,350 --> 00:52:37,790
That was so serious. I'm sorry.

670
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:39,750
We need more wine.

671
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:41,350
I like hearing about your life.

672
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:44,360
 Thanks.

673
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:48,120
Why are we here?

674
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:49,310
You'll see.

675
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:53,000
Best show in town.

676
00:52:57,390 --> 00:52:58,880
So you've done this before?

677
00:52:58,990 --> 00:53:00,230
Oh, yeah.

678
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:01,710
And it's safe?

679
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:03,950
No.

680
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:05,790
Reasonably safe.

681
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:09,630
Hop in. You're next.

682
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:12,230
What about my dress?

683
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:16,510
Right.

684
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:21,110
Turn around.

685
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:53,400
Tether attached.

686
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:35,990
What are you doing?

687
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:37,150
Do you trust me?

688
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:26,190
Thank you.

689
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:17,430
You're the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

690
00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:23,110
You kill me.

691
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:07,470
You okay?

692
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:08,960
Yeah.

693
00:57:10,670 --> 00:57:12,390
I'm fine.

694
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:13,960
It's just...

695
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:23,110
Yeah, I know.

696
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:41,510
So, I'm seeing someone.

697
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:43,240
You'll never guess who.

698
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:47,910
We're the last two people in the world
who would ever get together.

699
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:50,270
But here we are.

700
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:51,760
The last two people in the world.

701
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:53,270
What's that?

702
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:54,790
I'm writing, Arthur. Hush.

703
00:57:56,150 --> 00:57:59,150
Jim and I live
in accidental happiness.

704
00:57:59,230 --> 00:58:02,200
Like castaways,
making their home on strange shores.

705
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,430
"Strange shores." I love it.

706
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:05,800
You do? You don't have to say that.

707
00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:07,950
- I know.
- You're not gonna eat this.

708
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:11,800
Does that seem fishy to you?

709
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:14,910
Keep reading.

710
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:17,190
It's funny.

711
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:18,870
We all have dreams.

712
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:23,070
We plan our futures
like we're the captains of our fates.

713
00:58:23,950 --> 00:58:25,520
But we're passengers.

714
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:27,550
We go where fate takes us.

715
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:29,990
 I can't

716
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:31,150
Help

717
00:58:31,190 --> 00:58:32,190
Arthur!

718
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:33,870
This isn't the life we planned.

719
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:35,960
But it's ours.

720
00:58:36,030 --> 00:58:38,600
And for the first time in my life,

721
00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:40,350
I don't feel alone.

722
00:58:43,230 --> 00:58:45,310
We weren't supposed to find each other.

723
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:48,350
But we did.

724
00:58:49,310 --> 00:58:52,120
He makes me feel like my life isn't over.

725
00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:54,390
Like it's just beginning.

726
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:56,310
How was your day?

727
00:58:56,390 --> 00:58:58,390
Good. I wrote a few pages.

728
00:58:58,790 --> 00:59:00,710
Did you find anything that can help us?

729
00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:06,150
- I did.
- Are they real?

730
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:08,560
I cut them myself.

731
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:09,960
 Oh, wow!

732
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:13,550
You know, for two unlucky people,

733
00:59:13,590 --> 00:59:15,000
we sure got pretty lucky.

734
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:21,990
Attention.

735
00:59:22,110 --> 00:59:25,750
You may wish to proceed to a viewing area.

736
00:59:25,830 --> 00:59:29,190
The Avalon will slingshot
around the star Arcturus.

737
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:30,710
Look!

738
00:59:30,790 --> 00:59:32,630
Oh, my God!

739
01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:09,790
That was amazing.

740
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:13,310
A red giant.

741
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:19,950
The universe's present to you.

742
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:21,800
What?

743
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:24,910
Happy birthday.

744
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:36,280
 Happy birthday to you

745
01:00:36,350 --> 01:00:40,270
Happy birthday to you

746
01:00:40,350 --> 01:00:44,400
Happy birthday, dear Aurora

747
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:48,830
Happy birthday to you

748
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:52,830
A birthday drink
for the birthday girl.

749
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:54,160
Aren't you going to ask for my ID?

750
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:55,360
I might not be old enough to drink.

751
01:00:55,390 --> 01:00:57,870
Oh, I would never ask your age
in front of a gentleman.

752
01:00:58,310 --> 01:00:59,800
Jim's no gentleman.

753
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:02,350
Anyway, there's no secrets
between me and Jim.

754
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:06,270
- Is that so?
- You heard the lady.

755
01:01:06,350 --> 01:01:07,390
I will be right back.

756
01:01:22,790 --> 01:01:25,360
This is a perfect birthday drink.
Thank you.

757
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:28,550
I remember this day a year ago.

758
01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:30,670
Jim was so looking forward to meeting you.

759
01:01:31,870 --> 01:01:32,870
What?

760
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:35,590
How could he be looking forward to it?

761
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:38,350
Oh, he spent months deciding
whether to wake you up.

762
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:41,750
He couldn't stop talking about you.

763
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:47,640
Jim woke me up?

764
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:49,800
Oh, yes.

765
01:01:50,590 --> 01:01:53,430
He said it was the hardest
decision of his life.

766
01:01:53,550 --> 01:01:56,070
But I see it worked out just fine.

767
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:09,720
What?

768
01:02:12,430 --> 01:02:14,270
Did you wake me up?

769
01:02:21,990 --> 01:02:23,070
Yes, I woke you up.

770
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:29,070
How...

771
01:02:29,790 --> 01:02:30,990
How could you do it?

772
01:02:34,270 --> 01:02:35,630
I tried not to.

773
01:02:42,310 --> 01:02:43,750
I'm gonna be sick.

774
01:02:44,950 --> 01:02:46,470
I can't see.

775
01:02:48,510 --> 01:02:49,630
Aurora, please...

776
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:52,190
Stay away from me!

777
01:02:55,790 --> 01:02:57,390
 I can't get off this ship.

778
01:02:57,470 --> 01:02:59,950
I can't get off this ship. I can't get off.

779
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:12,750
No!

780
01:03:27,190 --> 01:03:28,230
Oh, God.

781
01:04:15,870 --> 01:04:17,440
Can I talk to you?

782
01:05:45,990 --> 01:05:47,750
Aurora,

783
01:05:47,870 --> 01:05:51,110
I know nothing I can say
will make this okay.

784
01:05:51,590 --> 01:05:52,920
But please listen.

785
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:55,830
I was so alone

786
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:57,480
for so long.

787
01:05:58,990 --> 01:06:00,270
It felt like I was disappearing.

788
01:06:02,070 --> 01:06:05,070
The night I first saw you,
I was ready to...

789
01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:09,670
You saved my life.

790
01:06:12,910 --> 01:06:16,030
And I know that's no excuse for what I did.

791
01:06:17,230 --> 01:06:18,990
I read everything you wrote,

792
01:06:19,590 --> 01:06:22,830
and I fell in love with your voice

793
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:25,960
and with the way your mind works.

794
01:06:26,110 --> 01:06:28,510
I fell in love with you.

795
01:06:29,710 --> 01:06:31,670
And all of a sudden,

796
01:06:31,870 --> 01:06:34,840
it was like I... I wasn't trapped anymore.

797
01:06:35,870 --> 01:06:39,110
My pointless life suddenly had meaning.

798
01:06:41,550 --> 01:06:43,630
And I wish I could take it back.

799
01:06:45,190 --> 01:06:46,680
But I can't.

800
01:06:48,150 --> 01:06:49,670
Aurora, I don't want to lose you.

801
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:51,870
I don't care!

802
01:06:52,110 --> 01:06:54,150
I don't care what you want!

803
01:06:54,470 --> 01:06:57,070
I don't care why you woke me up!

804
01:06:57,550 --> 01:07:00,230
You took my life!

805
01:07:23,230 --> 01:07:24,830
Please stand by.

806
01:07:24,910 --> 01:07:27,880
Your suite's control center is rebooting.

807
01:08:03,310 --> 01:08:04,990
I envy you, Arthur.

808
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:06,710
How so?

809
01:08:07,270 --> 01:08:08,950
You have a purpose.

810
01:08:11,550 --> 01:08:12,630
You're always happy.

811
01:08:13,950 --> 01:08:15,670
How's your book coming along?

812
01:08:16,350 --> 01:08:18,150
I've never written about myself before.

813
01:08:18,790 --> 01:08:20,720
I think it's some of the best work
I've ever done,

814
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:22,710
and I don't even know why I'm doing it.

815
01:08:23,950 --> 01:08:26,790
There's only one person who could read it,
and I can't stand him.

816
01:08:27,150 --> 01:08:30,510
They say time heals all wounds.

817
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:35,950
Broken hearts aren't that simple, Arthur.

818
01:08:38,790 --> 01:08:40,200
You wouldn't understand.

819
01:08:42,030 --> 01:08:43,520
Arthur!

820
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:49,670
Tuesday's my day with Arthur.

821
01:08:50,030 --> 01:08:51,150
It's Wednesday.

822
01:08:59,350 --> 01:09:00,430
The bar's all yours.

823
01:09:09,750 --> 01:09:11,190
What'll you have? Whiskey?

824
01:09:12,830 --> 01:09:14,350
Coffee.

825
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:16,040
Aurora! We love you!

826
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:18,230
What are we gonna do without you?
We'll miss you so...

827
01:09:21,030 --> 01:09:22,390
You're the bravest woman I know.

828
01:09:22,470 --> 01:09:23,880
Bye, Aurora!

829
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:27,950
I promise that I will
think of you every day.

830
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:30,150
When you wake up, I'll be gone,

831
01:09:30,230 --> 01:09:33,750
but just know that I will never forget you.

832
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:35,480
You're my best friend.

833
01:09:36,550 --> 01:09:39,390
You were never happy here. I know.

834
01:09:39,470 --> 01:09:41,590
Nothing was ever enough for you.

835
01:09:43,270 --> 01:09:45,230
You know, you don't have to go.

836
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:48,510
You could do
whatever it is you have to do right here.

837
01:09:50,230 --> 01:09:51,230
But, uh...

838
01:09:51,870 --> 01:09:54,990
Since you're going, here's my wish.

839
01:09:57,270 --> 01:10:01,550
I hope you finally find someone
who fills your heart, and

840
01:10:02,230 --> 01:10:04,190
I hope you let him in.

841
01:10:05,710 --> 01:10:09,630
I hope you realize you don't have to do
something amazing to be happy.

842
01:10:12,110 --> 01:10:14,710
You know, have fun,

843
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:17,190
take chances.

844
01:10:19,030 --> 01:10:20,870
Um, okay.

845
01:10:22,310 --> 01:10:23,750
I love you, Aurora.

846
01:10:24,510 --> 01:10:25,790
Bye.

847
01:10:28,710 --> 01:10:30,550
Morning, Arthur!

848
01:10:30,630 --> 01:10:32,550
- Coffee, please.
- Coming up.

849
01:10:38,590 --> 01:10:40,550
Are you soiling my barstool?

850
01:10:40,790 --> 01:10:43,070
You want to make things,
you got to get your hands dirty.

851
01:10:43,950 --> 01:10:45,150
And what have you been making?

852
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:47,000
Improvements.

853
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:49,990
Grand concourse.

854
01:11:17,150 --> 01:11:18,430
First floor.

855
01:11:31,710 --> 01:11:33,430
Gold-class breakfast.

856
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:52,590
This is Deck Chief Gus Mancuso.

857
01:11:53,230 --> 01:11:56,230
Who the hell planted a tree on my ship?

858
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:19,590
- Who did that?
- I did.

859
01:12:20,190 --> 01:12:21,190
Who are you?

860
01:12:21,550 --> 01:12:22,550
Jim Preston.

861
01:12:24,190 --> 01:12:25,190
Aurora Lane.

862
01:12:26,030 --> 01:12:27,310
Anybody else awake?

863
01:12:27,390 --> 01:12:28,910
Just me and him.

864
01:12:29,590 --> 01:12:31,080
How far along are we?

865
01:12:31,870 --> 01:12:33,110
Eighty-eight years to go.

866
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:43,710
Hibernation failure.

867
01:12:44,910 --> 01:12:46,630
They said that couldn't happen.

868
01:12:46,710 --> 01:12:49,950
Three people, three pod failures.

869
01:12:55,230 --> 01:12:57,910
You have no idea
how long I've been trying to get in there.

870
01:12:58,070 --> 01:13:00,310
Now that you're in, don't touch anything.

871
01:13:00,430 --> 01:13:01,920
This is where you work?

872
01:13:01,990 --> 01:13:04,230
No, this is flight crew. I'm a deck chief.

873
01:13:04,430 --> 01:13:05,430
Hmm.

874
01:13:05,550 --> 01:13:07,670
Ops, Navigation, Comm.

875
01:13:08,590 --> 01:13:09,670
Hmm.

876
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:12,870
Unauthorized personnel.

877
01:13:13,550 --> 01:13:14,590
Sorry.

878
01:13:17,150 --> 01:13:20,310
If I'm reading this right,
we're still on course.

879
01:13:20,390 --> 01:13:23,120
So whatever's wrong with the ship,
NavCom is still on the job.

880
01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:24,680
There's something wrong with the ship?

881
01:13:24,710 --> 01:13:27,150
Three pod failures?
Yeah, there's something wrong.

882
01:13:27,230 --> 01:13:28,990
Question is what.

883
01:13:31,710 --> 01:13:33,200
That's strange.

884
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:35,910
We should be getting diagnostics
from all over the ship right here,

885
01:13:35,950 --> 01:13:37,790
but there's no data.

886
01:13:39,710 --> 01:13:41,310
Got to check all the systems manually.

887
01:13:41,470 --> 01:13:43,550
Can't we turn the ship around,
go back to Earth?

888
01:13:43,630 --> 01:13:45,000
No, we're doing 50% of light speed.

889
01:13:45,030 --> 01:13:47,350
Turning back would
take just as much time as going on.

890
01:13:47,430 --> 01:13:49,190
Well, there's got to be
something we can do.

891
01:13:49,270 --> 01:13:51,630
Sorry. We're going where we're going.

892
01:13:54,190 --> 01:13:55,190
You okay?

893
01:13:56,510 --> 01:13:58,230
Hibernation hangover.

894
01:13:58,310 --> 01:13:59,960
Get it all the time.

895
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:02,110
Grand concourse.

896
01:14:02,190 --> 01:14:03,390
Two years, huh?

897
01:14:03,470 --> 01:14:05,390
Any more trees I need to know about?

898
01:14:05,470 --> 01:14:06,470
Look out!

899
01:14:11,830 --> 01:14:13,270
Never seen that before.

900
01:14:13,350 --> 01:14:15,230
These robots have been breaking down.

901
01:14:15,310 --> 01:14:17,960
This guy makes fifteen?

902
01:14:18,630 --> 01:14:19,670
Fifteen.

903
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:21,190
The breakfast bar went crazy today.

904
01:14:21,270 --> 01:14:23,590
- Yeah, and an elevator.
- Last week, my door broke.

905
01:14:23,670 --> 01:14:25,870
- I was trapped in my cabin for two days.
- You were?

906
01:14:27,350 --> 01:14:29,790
Things like that don't happen.
Not on this ship.

907
01:14:30,670 --> 01:14:32,710
There are 16 of these tech stations
on every deck.

908
01:14:33,710 --> 01:14:34,830
Dock your slate.

909
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:37,120
- Data syncs automatically. Got it?
- Hmm.

910
01:14:37,150 --> 01:14:38,830
- Yeah.
- Okay.

911
01:14:38,990 --> 01:14:41,350
You take decks one and two.
You take decks three and four.

912
01:14:41,430 --> 01:14:45,350
I'm going down to the hibernation bay,
check our pods.

913
01:14:45,990 --> 01:14:47,510
Well, that should be interesting.

914
01:14:58,230 --> 01:14:59,950
Ain't you supposed to be
making your rounds?

915
01:15:01,150 --> 01:15:02,390
I'm finished.

916
01:15:05,110 --> 01:15:06,830
I checked your pod.

917
01:15:07,790 --> 01:15:10,440
Problem's very simple.
The clock chip's burnt out.

918
01:15:10,510 --> 01:15:13,270
It ain't supposed to happen,
but pretty simple.

919
01:15:13,350 --> 01:15:14,840
My pod's more complicated.

920
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:17,800
Bunch of system failures that
all happened at the same time.

921
01:15:17,870 --> 01:15:19,670
Whole damn thing went haywire.

922
01:15:22,070 --> 01:15:23,870
Explains why I'm feeling so bad.

923
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:25,550
But Aurora's pod...

924
01:15:29,750 --> 01:15:31,350
You did this.

925
01:15:33,790 --> 01:15:34,790
 Yeah.

926
01:15:34,870 --> 01:15:37,310
All this time, I'm thinking
you're one lucky son of a bitch

927
01:15:37,390 --> 01:15:39,040
to get stuck with Aurora.

928
01:15:42,430 --> 01:15:44,350
It wasn't luck, was it?

929
01:15:44,910 --> 01:15:45,910
 No.

930
01:15:45,990 --> 01:15:47,070
She knows?

931
01:15:47,790 --> 01:15:48,910
She knows.

932
01:15:51,110 --> 01:15:52,350
How long were you alone?

933
01:15:52,910 --> 01:15:54,270
A year.

934
01:15:57,910 --> 01:15:59,270
Still...

935
01:16:01,110 --> 01:16:02,600
Damn.

936
01:16:08,390 --> 01:16:10,040
Data received.

937
01:16:13,990 --> 01:16:15,230
Data received.

938
01:16:20,110 --> 01:16:22,150
- Data received.
- Same as Jim's.

939
01:16:22,230 --> 01:16:23,430
Interpolating data.

940
01:16:23,510 --> 01:16:25,550
System shutdowns...

941
01:16:25,630 --> 01:16:27,910
Everywhere, but no apparent connection.

942
01:16:29,870 --> 01:16:31,230
You saw the hibernation pods?

943
01:16:32,270 --> 01:16:33,350
I saw them.

944
01:16:34,550 --> 01:16:35,590
Data received.

945
01:16:35,670 --> 01:16:36,950
So you know

946
01:16:38,310 --> 01:16:39,310
what Jim did.

947
01:16:42,310 --> 01:16:43,640
Yeah.

948
01:16:44,430 --> 01:16:45,430
And?

949
01:16:46,030 --> 01:16:48,350
- It's not my...
- He woke me up.

950
01:16:49,030 --> 01:16:50,390
He took away my life.

951
01:16:50,470 --> 01:16:52,550
I know, and I'm sorry,
but there's work I'd...

952
01:16:52,630 --> 01:16:54,390
It's murder.

953
01:16:57,310 --> 01:16:58,880
You're right, Aurora.

954
01:16:58,950 --> 01:17:02,550
But the drowning man will always try
and drag somebody down with him.

955
01:17:02,670 --> 01:17:05,270
It ain't right, but the man's drowning.

956
01:17:07,310 --> 01:17:08,990
This one makes 16.

957
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:13,630
 Yeah.

958
01:17:15,910 --> 01:17:17,630
Hey. You okay?

959
01:17:20,390 --> 01:17:22,870
- You should go rest.
-  Yeah.

960
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:28,030
But just a couple hours, and then back
at it first thing in the morning.

961
01:20:15,190 --> 01:20:16,800
I was in the pool when
the gravity gave out.

962
01:20:16,830 --> 01:20:17,950
Are you okay?

963
01:20:18,030 --> 01:20:19,680
We need to find Gus.

964
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:22,910
Gus! Gus!

965
01:20:23,910 --> 01:20:27,110
Gravity loss means that whatever's wrong
is starting to hit the big-ticket items.

966
01:20:27,150 --> 01:20:28,390
Not good.

967
01:20:29,270 --> 01:20:30,950
Every failure's a burnt out processor.

968
01:20:31,030 --> 01:20:33,790
Everything on board's thinking too hard.

969
01:20:34,310 --> 01:20:35,550
Why?

970
01:20:36,350 --> 01:20:39,030
Computer, display these failures over time.

971
01:20:39,110 --> 01:20:41,230
Processing timeline.

972
01:20:42,510 --> 01:20:44,030
Cascade failure.

973
01:20:45,110 --> 01:20:47,550
It started two years ago. Power surge.

974
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:50,670
Seventeen failures in one day.

975
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:53,550
Including hibernation pod 1498.

976
01:20:53,670 --> 01:20:54,710
That's me.

977
01:20:55,390 --> 01:20:56,830
Woke me up.

978
01:20:58,470 --> 01:21:01,040
- What happened that day?
- Something big.

979
01:21:01,150 --> 01:21:03,270
A major system went down somewhere.

980
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:06,030
Everything else on board
is trying to pick up the load,

981
01:21:06,110 --> 01:21:07,830
but the load's too heavy.

982
01:21:07,910 --> 01:21:09,750
Whatever started this, we got to find it.

983
01:21:09,910 --> 01:21:10,950
And fix it.

984
01:21:11,030 --> 01:21:12,360
How bad can this get?

985
01:21:13,750 --> 01:21:15,950
Give me risk analysis based on this data.

986
01:21:16,030 --> 01:21:17,070
Extrapolating.

987
01:21:17,670 --> 01:21:20,270
A mission-critical failure is imminent.

988
01:21:20,350 --> 01:21:23,320
Failing systems.
Life Support, Fusion Reactor...

989
01:21:23,430 --> 01:21:24,550
So we're stranded.

990
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:26,590
Hibernation Bay, Ion Drive...

991
01:21:26,670 --> 01:21:28,160
On a sinking ship.

992
01:21:37,190 --> 01:21:39,030
Main Engineering.

993
01:21:39,110 --> 01:21:42,000
Not a lot of things big enough
to hit this ship that hard.

994
01:21:45,030 --> 01:21:47,680
With Diagnostics out,
we'll have to find it ourselves.

995
01:21:48,430 --> 01:21:50,270
Where do we start?

996
01:21:50,790 --> 01:21:52,310
Gus!

997
01:21:55,670 --> 01:21:58,430
Scan complete. Analyzing data.

998
01:22:02,790 --> 01:22:04,470
 What's it say is wrong with me?

999
01:22:04,710 --> 01:22:06,390
It's a few things.

1000
01:22:06,470 --> 01:22:08,070
612 disorders found.

1001
01:22:09,190 --> 01:22:10,470
Get me out of here.

1002
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:26,630
What's the prognosis?

1003
01:22:26,710 --> 01:22:30,030
Critical diagnoses cannot be
discussed without a doctor in attendance.

1004
01:22:31,070 --> 01:22:32,790
Override on my authority.

1005
01:22:32,870 --> 01:22:35,110
ID 2317.

1006
01:22:35,190 --> 01:22:36,430
Lay it on me, doc.

1007
01:22:36,510 --> 01:22:38,310
Pansystemic necrosis.

1008
01:22:38,470 --> 01:22:41,120
Progressive organ failure. Cause, unknown.

1009
01:22:41,510 --> 01:22:43,670
My goofy hibernation pod. That's the cause.

1010
01:22:44,190 --> 01:22:47,190
- What's the treatment?
- Various treatments are possible.

1011
01:22:47,270 --> 01:22:49,510
None will meaningfully extend
the patient's life.

1012
01:22:53,470 --> 01:22:54,590
How long have I got?

1013
01:22:54,670 --> 01:22:57,240
Your end-of-life transition
is already underway.

1014
01:22:58,830 --> 01:23:02,750
These sedatives will alleviate your
suffering during these final hours.

1015
01:23:20,430 --> 01:23:21,870
Gus.

1016
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:28,280
I need a minute.

1017
01:23:58,110 --> 01:23:59,800
We are experiencing
difficulties in flight.

1018
01:24:01,070 --> 01:24:02,990
- Gus!
- Gus!

1019
01:24:03,070 --> 01:24:04,200
Where could he be?

1020
01:24:04,230 --> 01:24:07,120
For your own safety,
please return to your cabins.

1021
01:24:11,070 --> 01:24:13,910
We are experiencing difficulties in flight.

1022
01:24:13,990 --> 01:24:17,550
For your own safety,
please return to your cabins.

1023
01:24:17,710 --> 01:24:19,470
 Should've took the damn pills.

1024
01:24:20,310 --> 01:24:22,960
- I'll go get them.
- No. Stay here with me.

1025
01:24:24,430 --> 01:24:26,190
Sit down.

1026
01:24:30,510 --> 01:24:32,590
You two take care of each other.

1027
01:24:42,110 --> 01:24:43,520
My ID.

1028
01:24:45,350 --> 01:24:47,830
Get you where you need to go.

1029
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:50,710
Fix the ship.

1030
01:24:51,870 --> 01:24:53,950
Find out what's wrong with her.

1031
01:24:57,190 --> 01:24:58,470
How do I look?

1032
01:24:59,670 --> 01:25:01,470
You look magnificent.

1033
01:25:01,870 --> 01:25:04,600
 Ladies love the dress blues.

1034
01:25:14,150 --> 01:25:15,230
What do we do now?

1035
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:24,030
This can't be good.

1036
01:25:27,430 --> 01:25:29,110
I'm going back to Engineering.

1037
01:25:29,190 --> 01:25:30,760
Can you fix this?

1038
01:25:31,310 --> 01:25:32,830
I need your help.

1039
01:25:35,870 --> 01:25:36,870
Let's go.

1040
01:25:59,830 --> 01:26:00,870
Arthur!

1041
01:26:16,350 --> 01:26:17,350
Let's go.

1042
01:26:18,190 --> 01:26:19,190
 Yeah.

1043
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:23,430
Main Engineering.

1044
01:26:23,510 --> 01:26:25,470
Can't we wake up some of the crew?

1045
01:26:25,550 --> 01:26:27,920
It'll take them too long to recover.
We don't have that kind of time.

1046
01:26:27,950 --> 01:26:29,390
What are we even looking for?

1047
01:26:30,190 --> 01:26:33,190
Something broken. Something big.

1048
01:26:34,190 --> 01:26:35,470
Come on.

1049
01:26:37,230 --> 01:26:38,230
Is it broken?

1050
01:26:38,310 --> 01:26:40,470
It seems okay. What's next?

1051
01:26:40,550 --> 01:26:42,910
Power plant. This way.

1052
01:26:48,710 --> 01:26:50,390
Come on.

1053
01:26:50,750 --> 01:26:52,400
The whole section's closed off.
Something's wrong.

1054
01:26:52,430 --> 01:26:54,000
We're looking for wrong.

1055
01:26:54,070 --> 01:26:55,070
Try to open it.

1056
01:27:07,310 --> 01:27:09,990
Warning. Pressure fault.

1057
01:27:10,110 --> 01:27:12,030
Lockdown initiated.

1058
01:27:15,190 --> 01:27:18,310
- Please secure all doors.
- Hold on!

1059
01:27:20,950 --> 01:27:23,520
Warning. Dangerous oxygen level.

1060
01:27:23,590 --> 01:27:25,550
Please secure all doors.

1061
01:27:35,390 --> 01:27:37,190
Dangerous oxygen level.

1062
01:27:37,270 --> 01:27:39,390
Please secure all doors.

1063
01:27:43,630 --> 01:27:44,870
Grab it!

1064
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:54,670
Pressurizing cabin unsuccessful.

1065
01:28:03,230 --> 01:28:04,830
Pressure normalized.

1066
01:28:06,030 --> 01:28:07,830
Oxygen level restored.

1067
01:28:07,910 --> 01:28:09,910
-  There's a...
- End lockdown.

1068
01:28:09,990 --> 01:28:11,830
A hole in the ship.

1069
01:28:14,430 --> 01:28:15,510
More than one.

1070
01:28:19,230 --> 01:28:22,070
How did that even happen?
The ship's supposed to be meteor-proof.

1071
01:28:22,150 --> 01:28:23,310
I guess one got through.

1072
01:28:31,470 --> 01:28:32,470
It's hot.

1073
01:28:39,990 --> 01:28:41,110
I think we found it.

1074
01:28:51,550 --> 01:28:54,030
It's the reactor-control computer.

1075
01:28:59,870 --> 01:29:01,520
This is what hit us two years ago.

1076
01:29:01,590 --> 01:29:02,950
Jim...

1077
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:04,840
How can we fix this?

1078
01:29:08,710 --> 01:29:09,710
We're gonna die.

1079
01:29:09,830 --> 01:29:11,550
There's replacement pans for everything.

1080
01:29:16,470 --> 01:29:18,390
- Light.
- Sorry.

1081
01:29:20,710 --> 01:29:23,360
Soon as I pull this module,
the entire computer's gonna shut down.

1082
01:29:23,430 --> 01:29:25,270
Well, what happens then?

1083
01:29:26,830 --> 01:29:28,480
I'll get it back up as quickly as I can.

1084
01:29:33,230 --> 01:29:34,230
Hurry!

1085
01:29:36,950 --> 01:29:38,670
- Jim!
-  Okay.

1086
01:29:40,990 --> 01:29:42,750
Control computer restored.

1087
01:29:44,710 --> 01:29:45,910
Venting reactor.

1088
01:29:48,510 --> 01:29:50,950
- But we fixed it!
- Reactor vent failed.

1089
01:29:51,030 --> 01:29:53,390
Manual override required.

1090
01:29:59,190 --> 01:30:00,270
Vent failure.

1091
01:30:00,350 --> 01:30:01,950
- Come on!
- Jim.

1092
01:30:06,870 --> 01:30:08,590
Outer door non-responsive.

1093
01:30:08,670 --> 01:30:10,430
What does that mean?

1094
01:30:12,110 --> 01:30:13,990
The outer door is jammed.

1095
01:30:14,070 --> 01:30:16,040
We've got to open that door
and cool the reactor down,

1096
01:30:16,070 --> 01:30:17,430
or the whole ship is gonna blow.

1097
01:30:17,910 --> 01:30:20,270
- How?
- I got to go out there.

1098
01:30:20,350 --> 01:30:21,950
Open it from the outside.

1099
01:30:22,910 --> 01:30:24,480
I open the door, I get clear.

1100
01:30:25,590 --> 01:30:28,560
- You blow that fire into space.
- You get clear?

1101
01:30:28,630 --> 01:30:30,200
You can talk to me through this.

1102
01:30:30,310 --> 01:30:32,310
What happens to you when that door opens?

1103
01:30:42,790 --> 01:30:44,310
Heat shield. It might help.

1104
01:30:53,630 --> 01:30:55,200
You might need this.

1105
01:31:08,870 --> 01:31:09,870
It's gonna be okay.

1106
01:31:20,190 --> 01:31:21,270
I better go.

1107
01:31:26,590 --> 01:31:29,030
Jim. Jim.

1108
01:31:32,350 --> 01:31:33,870
Come back to me.

1109
01:31:35,550 --> 01:31:37,670
I can't live on the ship without you.

1110
01:32:03,150 --> 01:32:04,150
Warning.

1111
01:32:04,230 --> 01:32:06,030
- Temperature critical.
- Ow!

1112
01:32:19,230 --> 01:32:20,750
What's wrong?

1113
01:32:21,230 --> 01:32:22,310
What's the matter?

1114
01:32:22,390 --> 01:32:23,880
- Are you okay?
- Nothing.

1115
01:32:23,950 --> 01:32:25,750
- Go.
- You sure?

1116
01:32:25,870 --> 01:32:27,150
Go.

1117
01:32:34,870 --> 01:32:35,950
I'm at the vent tube.

1118
01:32:37,670 --> 01:32:39,710
New anchor point. Reset tether.

1119
01:32:43,750 --> 01:32:44,830
I see the door.

1120
01:32:46,150 --> 01:32:48,030
Temperature level rising.

1121
01:32:55,230 --> 01:32:57,230
Warning. Temperature critical.

1122
01:33:04,110 --> 01:33:05,710
Containment unstable.

1123
01:33:07,590 --> 01:33:09,790
-  Where are you?
- I'm at the door.

1124
01:33:09,870 --> 01:33:11,360
I'm ready. Just say when.

1125
01:33:11,470 --> 01:33:12,470
Here goes.

1126
01:33:16,150 --> 01:33:17,310
The door won't open.

1127
01:33:17,470 --> 01:33:19,120
I'll have to bypass it.

1128
01:33:21,430 --> 01:33:23,310
Temperature level rising.

1129
01:33:24,430 --> 01:33:25,550
Jim, come on!

1130
01:33:25,670 --> 01:33:27,160
Please hurry!

1131
01:33:27,510 --> 01:33:30,110
- Okay, I'm trying it again.
- Tell me when you're clear.

1132
01:33:34,630 --> 01:33:36,310
- No!
- What?

1133
01:33:37,110 --> 01:33:38,150
What's going on?

1134
01:33:39,230 --> 01:33:40,470
Jim?

1135
01:33:44,470 --> 01:33:45,510
Jim!

1136
01:33:45,870 --> 01:33:47,150
The door won't stay open.

1137
01:33:49,150 --> 01:33:50,310
I think I have to stay here.

1138
01:33:50,870 --> 01:33:52,200
Hold the door open.

1139
01:33:52,510 --> 01:33:53,510
What?

1140
01:33:53,590 --> 01:33:54,670
 No!

1141
01:33:54,990 --> 01:33:56,480
No way! Get out of there!

1142
01:33:56,550 --> 01:33:58,070
I can't.

1143
01:33:58,150 --> 01:33:59,510
Jim.

1144
01:33:59,870 --> 01:34:00,870
We're out of time.

1145
01:34:02,750 --> 01:34:05,190
- Containment unstable.
- Jim?

1146
01:34:12,030 --> 01:34:13,070
Vent the reactor.

1147
01:34:19,990 --> 01:34:22,350
No! You don't understand!

1148
01:34:23,190 --> 01:34:25,840
If I open the door right now,
it'll kill you!

1149
01:34:25,910 --> 01:34:26,910
I'm hoping not.

1150
01:34:27,030 --> 01:34:28,870
Come back in.
We'll think of something else.

1151
01:34:28,950 --> 01:34:30,360
There is nothing else.

1152
01:34:31,790 --> 01:34:32,830
 Jim!

1153
01:34:34,030 --> 01:34:35,030
- It's okay.
- No!

1154
01:34:35,110 --> 01:34:36,950
- It's not okay!
- Aurora...

1155
01:34:37,030 --> 01:34:38,830
Warning.
Temperature level exceeded.

1156
01:34:39,030 --> 01:34:40,910
This isn't what you said was gonna happen!

1157
01:34:42,590 --> 01:34:43,950
Aurora, this ship is gonna go.

1158
01:34:44,030 --> 01:34:46,030
I don't care! You die, I die.

1159
01:34:47,150 --> 01:34:49,720
There are 5,000 other people
on this ship, Aurora.

1160
01:34:51,270 --> 01:34:52,350
We have to do this.

1161
01:34:53,950 --> 01:34:55,390
Maximum pressure reached.

1162
01:34:58,950 --> 01:35:01,070
Do it. Now.

1163
01:35:02,750 --> 01:35:04,830
Maximum cabin pressure reached.

1164
01:35:26,390 --> 01:35:27,830
Temperature dropping.

1165
01:35:29,430 --> 01:35:30,430
Jim.

1166
01:35:49,270 --> 01:35:51,230
- Jim?
- Vent successful.

1167
01:35:51,310 --> 01:35:53,830
Rebooting process initiated.

1168
01:35:53,910 --> 01:35:55,270
Jim, please say something.

1169
01:36:32,630 --> 01:36:34,230
Suit pressure dropping.

1170
01:36:37,630 --> 01:36:40,150
Return to ship immediately.

1171
01:36:40,950 --> 01:36:42,230
Aurora?

1172
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:45,910
It worked!

1173
01:36:45,990 --> 01:36:47,350
You did it! You can come in!

1174
01:36:47,630 --> 01:36:50,200
Uh, yeah, about that.

1175
01:36:50,270 --> 01:36:52,390
What's the matter? Are you hurt?

1176
01:36:52,470 --> 01:36:54,190
I got blown out of the tube.

1177
01:36:54,270 --> 01:36:55,920
- What?
- My tether broke.

1178
01:36:56,030 --> 01:36:58,190
I can't get back to the ship.

1179
01:36:58,790 --> 01:37:00,710
I'll come out. I'll come out.
I'll pull you in.

1180
01:37:00,830 --> 01:37:03,480
Warning. Oxygen level critical.

1181
01:37:03,670 --> 01:37:05,790
Return to ship immediately.

1182
01:37:14,470 --> 01:37:16,990
Aurora, I'm sorry.

1183
01:37:19,030 --> 01:37:20,030
For everything.

1184
01:37:20,190 --> 01:37:22,390
Shut up. I'm coming.

1185
01:37:22,550 --> 01:37:26,550
I wish we'd have met in 90 years.

1186
01:37:31,910 --> 01:37:34,910
I'd... I'd have built you a house.

1187
01:37:39,710 --> 01:37:41,710
I'd have read your book.

1188
01:37:44,230 --> 01:37:45,510
It's gonna be great.

1189
01:37:58,150 --> 01:37:59,150
Tether attached.

1190
01:37:59,590 --> 01:38:01,270
Locate Jim Preston.

1191
01:38:05,950 --> 01:38:08,430
Jim Preston located.

1192
01:38:09,590 --> 01:38:10,920
I'm coming to get you.

1193
01:38:36,070 --> 01:38:37,430
Jim!

1194
01:39:37,350 --> 01:39:39,230
I'm sorry. The patient is dead.

1195
01:39:39,670 --> 01:39:41,470
Well, resuscitate him!

1196
01:39:41,550 --> 01:39:44,590
Postmortem operations require
authorized medical supervision.

1197
01:39:44,670 --> 01:39:46,470
 No.

1198
01:39:47,110 --> 01:39:48,520
Jim.

1199
01:39:54,070 --> 01:39:55,430
Override!

1200
01:39:55,510 --> 01:39:56,950
Override on my authority!

1201
01:39:57,030 --> 01:39:59,840
ID 1-7...

1202
01:40:02,030 --> 01:40:03,630
Two...

1203
01:40:03,710 --> 01:40:05,280
Two. Two.

1204
01:40:05,350 --> 01:40:06,550
 2-3-1-7.

1205
01:40:07,030 --> 01:40:09,510
2-3-1-7! ID 2-3-1-7!

1206
01:40:13,390 --> 01:40:14,550
Resuscitation.

1207
01:40:17,710 --> 01:40:19,790
Multiple procedures
are not recommended.

1208
01:40:19,870 --> 01:40:22,230
Override! Do it now!

1209
01:40:22,790 --> 01:40:23,950
Executing.

1210
01:41:20,190 --> 01:41:21,270
Hi!

1211
01:41:23,230 --> 01:41:24,230
 Jim!

1212
01:41:27,070 --> 01:41:28,350
Hey, Jim.

1213
01:41:56,350 --> 01:41:58,310
 You brought me back.

1214
01:41:58,750 --> 01:42:00,080
Yeah.

1215
01:42:24,310 --> 01:42:26,270
- Thank you.
- Be still.

1216
01:42:26,670 --> 01:42:27,870
Of course.

1217
01:43:13,350 --> 01:43:15,110
There's something I have to show you.

1218
01:43:15,390 --> 01:43:16,680
In command mode, it turns out

1219
01:43:16,710 --> 01:43:20,950
the Autodoc has an option
called Stabilize and Suspend.

1220
01:43:21,390 --> 01:43:23,590
It stops all metabolic activity.

1221
01:43:25,470 --> 01:43:26,470
What are you saying?

1222
01:43:26,910 --> 01:43:30,350
With Gus's ID, it can be like hibernation
inside the Autodoc.

1223
01:43:30,430 --> 01:43:31,430
You can go back to sleep.

1224
01:43:36,590 --> 01:43:38,430
But there's only one Autodoc.

1225
01:43:42,910 --> 01:43:44,270
Yeah.

1226
01:43:46,430 --> 01:43:50,350
And you're gonna lay down in it
and fall asleep.

1227
01:43:51,470 --> 01:43:53,710
And you'll wake up on Homestead II.

1228
01:43:53,790 --> 01:43:55,590
And you'll write your book.

1229
01:43:57,270 --> 01:43:58,350
You'd finish your journey.

1230
01:43:58,430 --> 01:44:00,310
You'd do what you set out to do.

1231
01:44:08,950 --> 01:44:10,630
You'd be alone.

1232
01:44:11,950 --> 01:44:13,670
I've been alone before.

1233
01:44:14,190 --> 01:44:15,430
And I'll be fine.

1234
01:44:17,190 --> 01:44:18,950
But I would never see you again.

1235
01:44:22,790 --> 01:44:24,310
I'll come and visit you.

1236
01:45:07,350 --> 01:45:09,000
Tuesday is my day with Arthur.

1237
01:45:11,150 --> 01:45:12,670
Lovely as ever.

1238
01:45:12,750 --> 01:45:14,990
Thank you, Arthur.
You're looking very well yourself.

1239
01:45:15,150 --> 01:45:16,510
Thanks to you.

1240
01:45:17,510 --> 01:45:18,510
What's that?

1241
01:45:21,550 --> 01:45:23,550
Something I've wanted to give you
for a long time.

1242
01:45:30,910 --> 01:45:32,510
It's beautiful.

1243
01:45:45,550 --> 01:45:47,710
Took you long enough to ask.

1244
01:45:50,790 --> 01:45:52,230
Champagne.

1245
01:45:52,790 --> 01:45:53,830
I'll wait.

1246
01:46:11,110 --> 01:46:12,910
 Hell of a life.

1247
01:46:15,390 --> 01:46:16,910
Hell of a life.

1248
01:46:48,190 --> 01:46:51,790
Crew wake-up process initiated.

1249
01:46:52,390 --> 01:46:54,270
My fellow passengers,

1250
01:46:54,350 --> 01:46:55,790
if you're reading this,

1251
01:46:55,870 --> 01:46:59,630
then the Starship Avalon
has reached its destination.

1252
01:46:59,710 --> 01:47:01,990
Grand concourse.

1253
01:47:02,070 --> 01:47:03,910
A lot happened while you slept.

1254
01:47:11,590 --> 01:47:13,470
A friend once said,

1255
01:47:13,550 --> 01:47:16,630
"You can't get so hung up
on where you'd rather be

1256
01:47:16,710 --> 01:47:19,790
"that you forget to make
the most of where you are."

1257
01:47:20,790 --> 01:47:22,830
We got lost along the way.

1258
01:47:23,830 --> 01:47:25,510
But we found each other.

1259
01:47:26,310 --> 01:47:28,030
And we made a life.

1260
01:47:28,110 --> 01:47:30,230
A beautiful life.

1261
01:47:30,630 --> 01:47:32,310
Together.

1262
01:47:35,830 --> 01:47:41,870
 There's so much on my mind
I don't know where to start

1263
01:47:41,950 --> 01:47:47,350
There's that light in your eye
Filling up the dark

1264
01:47:50,430 --> 01:47:53,830
Just levitate, just levitate

1265
01:47:56,830 --> 01:47:59,670
Just levitate, just levitate

1266
01:48:00,190 --> 01:48:05,830
I know that we're far
From where we need to be

1267
01:48:05,950 --> 01:48:10,950
But the world wasn't made in just one day

1268
01:48:12,150 --> 01:48:17,870
Though our journey's long
I know our love is strong

1269
01:48:17,950 --> 01:48:23,670
You're my shooting star
We're flying higher, babe

1270
01:48:26,790 --> 01:48:29,790
Just levitate, just levitate

1271
01:48:32,710 --> 01:48:35,550
Just levitate, just levitate

1272
01:48:38,870 --> 01:48:41,390
Just levitate, just levitate

1273
01:48:44,790 --> 01:48:48,150
Just levitate, just levitate

1274
01:48:48,230 --> 01:48:53,990
When I'm stuck in the
middle of hell and faith

1275
01:48:54,070 --> 01:48:58,950
And I don't know where to turn

1276
01:48:59,750 --> 01:49:04,750
To bend my mind as the silver gate

1277
01:49:05,750 --> 01:49:10,790
You lead me on my way

1278
01:49:14,870 --> 01:49:17,760
Just levitate, just levitate

1279
01:49:20,910 --> 01:49:22,990
Just levitate, just levitate

1280
01:49:27,110 --> 01:49:30,110
Just levitate, just levitate
