1
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,725
Do you ever feel like
nothing you do matters?

2
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,851
You leave footprints on the beach,
and tomorrow they're gone.

3
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,730
Like it's just today over again.

4
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,881
They say your teen years
are for making friends and having fun...

5
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,441
which made me feel even worse.

6
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,285
Hey, Amy. It's Jake.

7
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,010
I'm in your math class.

8
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,325
Hey, don't forget your adult diapers.

9
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,481
Yeah, right.

10
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,810
Jake. Phone for you.

11
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,886
But that day, everything changed.

12
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,651
Thanks for the ride, Shelley.

13
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,001
So, how come you have to go
deal with your grandpa?

14
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,567
My dad couldn't get out of work.

15
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,802
I didn't think he worked.

16
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,123
I'm just gonna call Grandpa.

17
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,051
Hello, this is Abe.

18
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,690
Hey, it's Jake.

19
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,083
No! Don't come here. Listen to me.

20
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,924
It's not safe.

21
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,127
Stay away.

22
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,647
Grandpa, did you take your pills today?

23
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,521
The key to my gun cabinet,
it was in the drawer.

24
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,011
And now it's gone.

25
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,371
Yeah, Dad took it, all right?

26
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,649
For safekeeping. It's okay.

27
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,320
Your father wants I should
fight them without a gun?

28
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,610
God bless him.

29
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,168
What's his deal, Alzheimer's?

30
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,005
Dementia.

31
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,971
That guy gave me the heebie-jeebies.

32
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,603
Holler if you need me.

33
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,920
Grandpa?

34
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,361
Shelley!

35
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,281
What's goin' on?

36
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,881
Someone broke in.

37
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,601
I've got a .38 in my car. You wait there.

38
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,721
Grandpa!

39
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,130
911. What's your emergency?

40
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,527
911? Yeah, I need the paramedics.

41
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,001
It's at 2040 Palm Circle. My grandpa...

42
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,241
Sir, what's your emergency?

43
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,400
Grandpa.

44
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,482
You have to get away from here.

45
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,880
Sir, can you hear me?

46
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,803
Please. Listen.

47
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,684
Go to the island.

48
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,649
Sir, paramedics are on their way.

49
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,928
Find Emerson.

50
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,844
The postcard.

51
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,525
Go to the loop.

52
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,411
September 3rd, 1943.

53
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,121
It's okay.

54
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,203
Just don't move.
There's an ambulance coming.

55
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,284
I know you think I'm crazy.

56
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,484
But the bird will explain everything.

57
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,729
Will you do this, Tygrysku? Promise me?

58
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,325
I promise, yes.

59
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,926
I thought I could protect you.

60
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,166
I should have told you years ago.

61
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,327
Grandpa. Tell me what?

62
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,920
Grandpa!

63
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,080
Shelley, behind you!

64
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,210
There was no one there.

65
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,969
May I say, Jake...

66
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,282
that considering
this was only a month ago...

67
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,920
I think you're doing exceptionally well.

68
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,801
Apart from being crazy?

69
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,241
Having nightmares and anxiety
doesn't make you crazy.

70
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,927
What about seeing things
which aren't there?

71
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,440
Actually, in traumatic situations,
it's not at all uncommon.

72
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,207
Your subconscious mind drew
an image from a movie or...

73
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,845
It was a story.

74
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,600
My grandpa told me stories
when I was a kid...

75
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,491
about monsters that he fought in the war.

76
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,641
So there you go.

77
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,529
He was brutally attacked...

78
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,002
and in your head, the man
who did it was inhuman, a monster.

79
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,447
It wasn't a man, though.

80
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:34,207
The cops said that dogs
scratched up the screen door...

81
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,330
and he chased them off into the woods.

82
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,687
And the coroner said
he had a heart attack.

83
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,844
And the cops said...

84
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,886
that dogs go for the soft parts.

85
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,569
They DNA tested the fork...

86
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,564
and it had animal DNA.

87
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,001
So, that's case closed.

88
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,851
He sounds like an extraordinary gentleman.

89
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,288
Were you very close?

90
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,921
Puerto Rico.

91
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,281
Here.

92
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,450
There's a lake
where the water
glows in the dark.

93
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,524
And a secret tunnel.

94
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,001
That's where I hid from the monsters.

95
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,369
He used to babysit me a lot.

96
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,802
When I was with him, I felt special.

97
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,130
My duck was dry again.

98
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,683
Abe. It's, like, 11:00.
What is he doing up?

99
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,640
I'm gonna be an explorer.

100
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,644
Grandpa's helping me plan my first voyage.

101
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,962
Everything's already
been discovered, buddy.

102
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,091
They terrorize each other...

103
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,965
before wreaking havoc
on the rest of the island.

104
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,360
Pay no attention to your father.

105
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,521
He knows bubkes.

106
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,048
Come, Tygrysku. Off to bed.

107
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,560
And they're not choosy.

108
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,369
These talons come in squadrons.

109
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,726
Touchdown, Florida! What a drive.

110
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,920
Can you tell me a story?

111
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
The usual?

112
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,081
Mmm-hmm.

113
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,803
Okay. Once upon a time...

114
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,246
there was a little boy...

115
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,811
With the pictures.

116
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,601
Pictures.

117
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,051
Once upon a time...

118
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,851
there was a little boy called Abe.

119
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,331
That was you.

120
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,761
That was me.

121
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,160
And he lived in a lovely children's home

122
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,890
on a little island near Wales...

123
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,242
where the sun shone every day.

124
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,210
The headmistress, Miss Peregrine...

125
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,249
was very clever.

126
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,880
And she smoked a pipe.

127
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,201
She could turn into a bird.

128
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,521
Mmm-hmm.

129
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,691
It was a home for special children...

130
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,083
like Bronwyn and Victor.

131
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,811
They were both as strong as 10 men.

132
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,761
And Hugh...

133
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,322
Hugh had bees living inside him.

134
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,641
Where's Emma?

135
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,564
She could float.

136
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,642
She was lighter than air.

137
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,040
She had to wear special shoes made of lead

138
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,963
to keep her from floating away.

139
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,723
Where is she now?

140
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,400
She's still on the island, I believe.

141
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,481
My mama and papa sent me there...

142
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,927
to live with the special children.

143
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,448
And now, Tygrysku, time for sleep.

144
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,449
He used to call me Tygrysku.

145
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,529
It's Polish for "little tiger."

146
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,207
He couldn't have picked
a less appropriate nickname.

147
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,771
I was always a chicken.

148
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,605
Why did your mom and dad send you away?

149
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,361
Well, where we lived
in Poland, it wasn't safe.

150
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,326
There were monsters.

151
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,767
What kind of monsters?

152
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,720
Huge ones, with long arms...

153
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,803
and no eyes...

154
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,571
and tentacles like this.

155
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,527
The dumb thing was...

156
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,842
for years, I actually believed his stories.

157
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,607
And this is Millard. He's invisible.

158
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,885
My teacher says they were trick photos.

159
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,165
And did you believe her?

160
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,686
Dad says you probably found them
at a junk store someplace...

161
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,241
when you went traveling.

162
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,880
I would never lie to you, Tygrysku.

163
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:33,490
But you did, about the home, the monsters.

164
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,125
Dad told me.

165
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,887
Your father knows very well
I went to live in the children's home.

166
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,003
He said there really were
monsters in Poland...

167
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,284
just not the kind with tentacles.

168
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,169
He said you got sent to Wales
'cause there were bad people.

169
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,611
People who wanted to kill
anyone who was different.

170
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,728
I don't wanna talk about this anymore.

171
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,690
He said the children were special...

172
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,611
but not the way you said.

173
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,169
I'm just saying, tomorrow
was supposed to be a writing day.

174
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,005
Five years and counting on that damn book.

175
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,003
And taking one day to be with
your son on his birthday...

176
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,366
is gonna be a big difference?

177
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,561
Fine.

178
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,281
You find something good?

179
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,165
Oh, look at that. That's awesome.

180
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,364
You should take that.

181
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,409
Come on, buddy, let's roll.

182
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,848
How are you so okay?

183
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,885
Jakey, you were a lot closer
to him than I ever was.

184
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,883
He was a wonderful grandpa...

185
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,883
but not such a great dad.

186
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,440
Never seemed to pick a job...

187
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,684
that didn't involve late nights
or long trips away, though.

188
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,244
Me and Aunt Susie always kind of thought
he was, maybe, cheating on our mom.

189
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,562
I'm sorry, buddy.
I know how much you worshiped him...

190
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,484
but there it is.

191
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,810
Surprise!

192
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,121
Happy birthday, Cousin Jake!

193
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,080
J-dog, it's great you're coming
to spend a summer with us.

194
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,446
Wait till you see the new boat.

195
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,205
Can't wait.

196
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,804
It's Aunt Susie.

197
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,687
Thought you might wanna open this one.

198
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,002
It's from your grandpa.

199
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,326
Found it while I was packing up.

200
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,091
I figured he meant
to give it to you someday.

201
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,480
Thanks.

202
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,645
To Jake, and the worlds
he has yet to discover.

203
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,650
My dearest Abe...

204
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,882
I hope this card finds you well.

205
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,089
The children and I yearn to hear your news.

206
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,607
I do hope you will visit us again soon.

207
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,569
We should so love to see you.

208
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,085
With admiration...

209
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,441
Alma Peregrine.

210
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,928
Hmm. Only two years ago.

211
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,090
I suppose it's possible
she could still be alive.

212
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,801
Right.

213
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,528
I could meet her.

214
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,611
Maybe even find out what it was
Grandpa wanted me to know.

215
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,091
But what if she's dead?

216
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,241
Dr. Golan...

217
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,484
we are very concerned
with Jake's state of mind right now.

218
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,121
There's no way I'm putting my life
on hold to take you to Wales.

219
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,925
Dad could take me.

220
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,686
And he can look at birds...

221
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,001
and work on his book.

222
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,681
It means you get a break.

223
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,205
As Dr. Golan said...

224
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,607
maybe I can move on.

225
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,720
Like, closure.

226
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,405
Having an opportunity
to see this children's home...

227
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,688
and separate fantasy from reality...

228
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,645
may be helpful.

229
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,165
And at the very least...

230
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,891
a trip like this provides a chance to...

231
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,210
say goodbye.

232
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,126
"Cairnholm. Population of 92.

233
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,569
"Best known for its proximity...

234
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,730
"to the final resting place
of the cruise liner Augusta...

235
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,247
"which sank in 1915.

236
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,729
"There is just one hotel..."

237
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,441
That's us.

238
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,480
Yeah. I hope there's bourbon.

239
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,530
Oh, wow!

240
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,410
Jake, check it out.

241
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,688
That's a peregrine falcon.

242
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,320
A peregrine, like the headmistress?

243
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,411
Sure.

244
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,044
That's probably where Grandpa came up
with that whole turning into a bird thing.

245
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,690
Or maybe, maybe that's really her!

246
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,370
Hey, Miss Peregrine.

247
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,931
It's me, Jake.

248
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,287
I'm Abe Portman's grandson.

249
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,602
Please don't crap on us.

250
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,081
Oh, my God. Dad, I'm kidding.

251
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,442
What the... Hello?

252
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,601
Hello?

253
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,804
Anybody home?

254
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,001
Oh, hey.

255
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,447
Any idea where I'd find
the manager of this place?

256
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,648
That's me. Sorry to keep you.

257
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,680
Just helping Uncle Oggie to the loo.

258
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,000
Oh. Oh.

259
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,844
I'm Kev. There's room upstairs.

260
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,001
Oh, great.

261
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,200
I'll be back in a bit.

262
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,327
Okay.

263
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,162
Kev's just getting our suite ready.

264
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,525
Um, while we're waiting...

265
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,286
I thought maybe we could go
check out the beach.

266
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,363
I thought we would go
to the children's home.

267
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,807
Is the beach where the birds nest?

268
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,361
I thought we could just
check it out real quick.

269
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,126
I could go to the home by myself.

270
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,921
Then, you can really
take your time and enjoy it.

271
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,526
Come on, Jakey.
You know your mom would freak.

272
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,921
What if we can find someone to take me?

273
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,881
Hey, dudes.

274
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,931
- Dad. Don't.
- Shh! I got this.

275
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,605
I was just wondering if any of you guys...

276
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,322
might be interested in taking my son
here to the other side of the island.

277
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,485
So, what are your names?

278
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,642
I'm Worm. This is MC Dirty D.

279
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,046
MC Dirty Bizniz.

280
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,240
I thought you changed it.

281
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,320
No.

282
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,686
No, you did, remember?

283
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,009
When Ruth said "MC Dirty Bizniz"
made it sound like you cacked your trousers.

284
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,201
Yeah, but she said "Dirty D" sounded like
a personal hygiene problem.

285
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,011
Wait. Are these, like, nicknames, or...

286
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,970
Stage names.
We're the sickest rappers in Wales.

287
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,327
Go on, Worm. Show this Yank how it's done.

288
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,480
What? Now?

289
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,284
I like to get wrecked down the Priest Hole

290
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,204
Your dad's always here
'cause he's on the dole

291
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,249
Our rhymes are tight
Yet I make it look easy

292
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,482
Our beats are hot like chicken jalfrezi

293
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,528
Oh, yeah, no. It's good.

294
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,242
Should we take the shortcut, D?

295
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,528
We'll get there quicker. Take it from me.

296
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,006
- What, down here?
- Mm-hmm.

297
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,161
Yeah.

298
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,321
Go.

299
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,886
This way?

300
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,521
What the...

301
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,165
Is this even the way
to the children's home?

302
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,004
Right through those trees.

303
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,449
No use crying over a lost shoe, boy-o.

304
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,126
The children's home. What happened to it?

305
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:38,001
A German air raid.
Bomb fell right on the roof.

306
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,243
September the 3rd, 1943.

307
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,360
Where did they go after?

308
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,522
The headmistress and the children.

309
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,130
Not one survivor. Poor little buggers.

310
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,486
And they were lovely, too.

311
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,647
Why didn't he tell us that they all died?

312
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,600
He leaves to join the army,
and 3 months later,

313
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,887
everyone he knows gets killed?

314
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,963
Not even Grandpa could turn
that into a bedtime story.

315
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,884
Well, no wonder he was
scared of being a dad...

316
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,690
being close to anyone.

317
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,801
Listen.

318
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,127
You need to talk
about all this with someone, buddy.

319
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,884
We should call Dr. Golan.

320
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,167
Certainly some enjoyment today.

321
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,171
Er, do you mind if I go hang out
with those other kids today?

322
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,521
They asked.

323
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,246
Yeah? That's awesome.

324
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,527
Abe?

325
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,400
No!

326
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,921
You're Emma!

327
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,489
And the twins.

328
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,846
And Olive.

329
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,925
And Bronwyn.

330
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,881
And he's Millard.

331
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,401
Mm-hmm.

332
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,607
No, you're dead.

333
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,770
All of you, you're all dead.

334
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,685
He's invisible, but he's still dead.

335
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,161
None of us are dead.

336
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,888
Oh, my God. Am I dead?

337
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,321
No.

338
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,562
You called me Abe.

339
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,008
In the house. Why?

340
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,241
You looked like him.

341
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,042
Just for a moment,
before you started screaming...

342
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,083
running away, and concussing yourself.

343
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,725
Wait. What's happening?

344
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,211
We're waiting until the coast is clear...

345
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,771
before we go into the loop.

346
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,691
You never know who might be watching.

347
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,366
Wait. Before we go into what?

348
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,521
Please, Jake.

349
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,047
Miss Peregrine's waiting.
She saw you on the ferry.

350
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,326
She sent us to get you.

351
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,881
Hey!

352
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,645
Where do you think you're going?

353
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,846
To my room.

354
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,364
I'm a guest here.

355
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,009
Does this look like a hotel to you?

356
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,085
Yeah.

357
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,647
No. I've got a key.

358
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,802
Talk to the manager. He'll tell you.

359
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,721
I'm the manager, boy.

360
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,364
He's American. Maybe he's army?

361
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,680
Bollocks.

362
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,603
Listen to his accent. It's terrible.

363
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,609
He's a spy.

364
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,920
What?

365
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,287
No, I'm not. I'm a tourist.

366
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:28,644
I say we should get the truth
out of him the old-fashioned way.

367
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,727
Get down!

368
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,806
Come on!

369
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,686
Jake, get on!

370
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,080
Come on! Get on, boy!

371
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,090
I can't believe you're real.
You're all real!

372
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,810
We have been trying to tell you.

373
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,200
But I'm special, too.

374
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,360
What?

375
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,010
In the pub. Olive, you saw.

376
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,289
Right? Everything was flying and breaking.

377
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,441
And that was me!

378
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,888
I was doing it with my mind.

379
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,923
No, that was me.

380
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,201
Millard?

381
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,921
Yeah.

382
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,200
Are you naked?

383
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,327
Yeah.

384
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,641
Oh.

385
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,967
I don't...

386
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,126
A bomb dropped on you in 1943.

387
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,649
It is 1943.

388
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,485
September the 3rd, 1943.

389
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,369
All day, every day.

390
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,686
It's our loop.

391
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,800
Right on time.

392
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,963
Miss Peregrine. Delighted to meet you.

393
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,960
I do hope I'm not going
to have the pub landlord

394
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,929
knocking on my door with the police again.

395
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,684
I've had to kill them twice this month.

396
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,604
It's been terribly inconvenient.

397
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,888
Millard broke a few things. That's all.

398
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,567
And Olive may have started a tiny fire.

399
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,602
But they were going to hurt Jake.

400
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,964
Look at you.

401
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,804
The last time dear Abe
sent me a photograph...

402
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,968
you were just a tiny tot.

403
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,731
Don't just stand there. Come in.

404
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,285
Your tea's getting cold.

405
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,848
How did you know about the pub?

406
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,040
You weigh approximately
109 pounds, correct?

407
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,160
I don't...

408
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,447
Bronwyn and the twins returned
6 minutes after you ran away.

409
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,051
I think I'm missing something.

410
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,481
And quite apart from the fact
that the perceived safety of the pub...

411
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,608
makes it the most likely place
to which you would flee...

412
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,603
it would take you 18 minutes to run there.

413
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,649
Emma and Millard would have
been moments behind...

414
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,689
on the horse and trap,
traveling at 8.2 miles per hour.

415
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,922
Factoring in some sort
of kerfuffle at the pub...

416
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,208
and the return journey
with your added weight...

417
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,330
you would arrive here
at 13 minutes past 4.

418
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,521
Now, then, do you take sugar?

419
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,605
That'll do. Thank you, Olive.

420
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,206
Nobody enjoys over-boiled tea.

421
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,367
Let me help you with those, Enoch.

422
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,131
Don't bother. Wouldn't want
to interrupt your tea party.

423
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,328
I'm so sorry for your loss, Jake.

424
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,048
You know, then.

425
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,690
I know if Abe were alive,
he would have told me you were coming.

426
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,083
Shall we take our tea outside?

427
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,281
Thank you.

428
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,490
Before he died, he told me to find you.

429
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,330
There was something he wanted me to know.

430
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,050
He said you could explain everything.

431
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,565
That's absolutely true.

432
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,041
There are very few things I can't explain.

433
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:46,724
We're what's known,
in common parlance, as "peculiar."

434
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,324
51 seconds late, Fiona.

435
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,040
Sorry, Miss Peregrine.

436
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,690
How many carrots do you need for supper?

437
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,202
Just one will do.

438
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,763
As I was saying, some people are peculiar.

439
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,924
It's a recessive gene
carried down through families.

440
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:21,561
Yet, many generations can pass
without a peculiar child being born.

441
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,924
And alas, peculiars have been
persecuted through the ages.

442
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,208
Hence, we live in places like this.

443
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,201
In Wales?

444
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,368
Anywhere will do
if you pick the right day.

445
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,090
That's fine now, Fiona.

446
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,766
You see, I'm a type of
peculiar called an Ymbryne.

447
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,285
That means I can...

448
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,680
Yeah, you turn into a bird.

449
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,569
I do. Yes.

450
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,449
But that's not very useful.

451
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,570
An Ymbryne's main skill
is the manipulation of time.

452
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,802
We choose a safe place, a safe day...

453
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,088
and create a loop.

454
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,291
What do you mean?

455
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,808
A loop preserves the last 24 hours.

456
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,645
Reset the loop, and the day
is yours to live in again.

457
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,566
Reset it daily...

458
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,643
and you can stay there forever.

459
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,882
Entirely safe from the outside world.

460
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,564
Right on time, Bronwyn. Good girl.

461
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,650
And that's why we Ymbrynes
are charged with the care of the young.

462
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,321
And no one ever gets older.

463
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,080
It's best for everyone this way.

464
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,491
I assure you.

465
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,970
Every Ymbryne commits herself...

466
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,282
to the creation and upkeep
of a place like this.

467
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,965
A home for peculiar children.

468
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,080
You wanna muck around?

469
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,241
Your bees.

470
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,771
Get it!

471
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,290
You met the twins.

472
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,526
This is Claire.

473
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,487
Millard, pass the ball.
We're playing together.

474
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,044
Millard you met.

475
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,681
Ugh. Come on!

476
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,851
And that's Hugh.

477
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,884
Stop cheating, Hugh.

478
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,881
Millard, that's a foul again.

479
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,328
No, it wasn't. Ref?

480
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,722
If you two can't play soccer
without squabbling...

481
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,405
I do wish you wouldn't play at all.

482
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,561
Do you know what a referee is?

483
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,644
Good afternoon. I'm Horace.

484
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,801
Delighted to meet you.

485
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,086
Ow!

486
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,241
Careful!

487
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,885
We sorely need some new blood here.

488
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,321
Super shirt, by the way.

489
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,641
Thanks.

490
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,524
Try harder.

491
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,925
You know Emma, of course.

492
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,764
And I think that's everyone.

493
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,681
Didn't Bronwyn have a brother?

494
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,608
Yes. Victor's upstairs.

495
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,000
Wait, where did Enoch and Olive go?

496
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,041
Heaven knows.

497
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,202
Enoch's been off sulking
ever since we went out to get Jake.

498
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,046
Miss Peregrine, there's
a policeman at the door.

499
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,611
He says it's about the pub!

500
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,764
We'll discuss this later, Emma.

501
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,884
It wasn't their fault.

502
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,287
Honestly, they were just trying to help.

503
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,726
Hmm.

504
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,446
Thanks.

505
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,443
You're not as wet as I thought.

506
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,047
She's not really gonna
kill anyone, is she?

507
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,282
Not if she can talk her way out of it.

508
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,130
Would you help me with something?

509
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,411
Enoch usually does it, but like I said,
he's off sulking somewhere.

510
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,210
Is that because of me?

511
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,971
He's possessive.

512
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,248
So, what did you need help with?

513
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,451
One of my daily chores.

514
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,001
Put the baby squirrel back in the tree.

515
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,321
What baby squirrel?

516
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,851
That happens every day?

517
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,286
Like clockwork.

518
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,003
Now, would you mind tying
that rope around my waist?

519
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,967
Uh, yeah.

520
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,448
Right. Promise to hold on tight.

521
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,083
I nearly messed that up.

522
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,046
Abe did, too, the first time.

523
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,929
This used to be his job.

524
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,602
Emma, I need to tell you something.

525
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,921
He's dead.

526
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,721
I know.

527
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,451
Miss Peregrine guessed,
and she's always right.

528
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,921
It's okay.

529
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,922
I said goodbye to him a long time ago.

530
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,205
Were you close?

531
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,250
I thought we were.

532
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,969
For a while.

533
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,770
But I suppose not.

534
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,930
Can I ask, was he like you?

535
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,730
He was like you, Jake.

536
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,850
I need to go and change for supper.

537
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,646
Will you be dining with us?

538
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,969
I can't stay out late.

539
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,770
Supper's at 5:30.

540
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,122
Uh... That is pretty early.

541
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,130
The fact we're not all eight years old
seems to have eluded Miss Peregrine.

542
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,129
You can borrow some of Abe's clothes.

543
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,322
His room's in the attic.

544
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,641
Jake!

545
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,571
Come and meet Enoch properly.

546
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,847
You must feel pretty out of place.

547
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,966
Don't worry.

548
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,284
I'm used to it.

549
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,641
No. I wasn't worried.

550
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,531
Some advice for you though, man to man.

551
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,808
If you're thinking of staying
just because you like Emma...

552
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,361
don't bother.

553
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,841
You see, she swore off
romance decades ago...

554
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,331
when she got her heart broken.

555
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,044
And she's never gonna
change her mind. So...

556
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,970
Enoch, I wasn't...

557
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,881
What are you doing?

558
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,806
Isn't he amazing?

559
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,401
What did you do?

560
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,491
This?

561
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,167
Jake, this isn't even the fun part.

562
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,920
Do you want to see the fun part?

563
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,001
They're like puppets.

564
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,601
Just do anything I tell them.

565
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,604
It's even more fun with people.

566
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,410
You should have seen some of
the epic battles they used to have...

567
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,891
at my parents' funeral parlor.

568
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,446
You'll need a necktie.

569
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:22,644
So what did my grandpa do
when he was traveling?

570
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,209
Visited other loops.

571
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,246
Really? To do what?

572
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:32,722
Jake, there's some questions
that I can't answer, all right?

573
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,928
So, it would be a lot easier
for me if you just...

574
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,131
stopped asking them.

575
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,000
Hey! What are you doing?

576
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,081
Millard.

577
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,083
Go and put some clothes on.

578
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,322
Polite persons do not take
their supper in the nude.

579
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,528
All right. All right.

580
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,603
You can sit here, Jake.

581
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,841
Look at Enoch.

582
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,681
He's jealous.

583
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,849
Why would I be jealous?

584
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,968
Olive can go marry Jake, for all I care.

585
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,521
Don't be mean, Enoch. She doesn't want to.

586
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,603
She's just excited to have a visitor.

587
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,524
Nobody is marrying anybody.

588
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,444
Now, eat up your food before it gets cold.

589
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,367
Hugh!

590
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,329
Where's your net?

591
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,047
Hugh! You have to stop doing this, Hugh.

592
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,204
Go away!

593
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,643
Must be very strange for you, Jake.

594
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,963
Meeting your grandfather's friends.

595
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,724
Visiting another century.

596
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,723
Are there spaceships in your time, Jake?

597
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,325
Like the Flash Gordon books.

598
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,561
Now, now, Olive.

599
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,404
What did I say about asking questions?

600
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,730
We don't discuss the future here.

601
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,406
We enjoy living
in the good old here and now.

602
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,806
Claire, why aren't you eating?

603
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,004
She's embarrassed in front of Jake.

604
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,730
Don't be. Please.

605
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,841
So, Jake, what's your peculiarity?

606
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,603
Oh, I'm not peculiar.

607
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,849
And that, my friends,
is why he will not be staying with us...

608
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,446
no matter how hard we try to persuade him.

609
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,206
We've spoken about this.
Jake is just visiting.

610
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,600
He might want to stay.

611
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,524
Don't you want to stay, Jake?

612
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,405
Tonight? Or...

613
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,688
Forever. You should stay forever.

614
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,201
Why would he, if he doesn't have to?

615
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,408
He can live out there, grow older...

616
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,085
have a good time instead.

617
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,811
He'll leave,
just like his grandfather did.

618
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,121
Emma!

619
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,486
Excuse me.

620
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,641
Where's she going?

621
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,961
That wasn't nice, Enoch.

622
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,651
You know perfectly well why Abe left us.

623
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,801
To join the army.

624
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,486
And then he met a lady,
and had a nice wedding cake...

625
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,320
and a lovely little baby.

626
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,401
Children.

627
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,641
I know you'd all like a new friend...

628
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,168
but I'm sure Jake has plenty
of his own back in Florida.

629
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,401
I think you should all get ready
for movie time while I answer that.

630
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,562
But you always let us stay for it.

631
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,130
Hello, this is Abe.

632
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,484
How is everyone?

633
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,010
Yours has extra marshmallows, Jake.

634
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,447
Millard, put some pajamas on.

635
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,965
It's too hot in here.

636
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,326
Stop moaning.

637
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,481
Excuse me.

638
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,367
My grandpa told me about this.

639
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,887
Horace projects his dreams, right?

640
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,485
He used to listen to the radio.

641
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,371
Gets tedious when you know
every word off by heart.

642
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,209
Splendid. I'll take it.

643
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,890
He dreams about clothes mostly.

644
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,246
Delighted to meet you.

645
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,848
Super shirt, by the way.

646
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,243
When did he dream this?

647
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,686
Last night.

648
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,410
Some of his dreams are prophetic.

649
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,801
But, mostly they're about clothes.

650
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:05,243
Prophetic as in,
he can see into the future?

651
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,444
An Ymbryne. Who is she?

652
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,250
Miss Peregrine, do you know her?

653
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,441
Don't be silly.

654
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,762
Horace must have
just had a bad dream. That's all.

655
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,571
Aw!

656
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,766
That's quite enough of that.
Thank you, Horace.

657
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,604
I should probably get going.

658
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,881
You could stay the night,
if you wanted to.

659
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,963
Rather than walk home alone in the dark.

660
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:14,329
But the island is very safe, isn't it?

661
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,720
Of course!

662
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,486
I only meant the path is dreadfully bumpy.

663
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,801
Jake could trip.

664
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,729
Perhaps you could show him the shortcuts.

665
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,770
Should he ever need to avoid bumps.

666
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,840
Won't you at least
stay to see the reset, Jake?

667
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,080
It's really quite spectacular.

668
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,969
- Yeah!
- Stay, Jake!

669
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,285
Come on, Jake!

670
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,280
Run, rabbit, run, rabbit

671
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,880
Run, run, run

672
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:11,960
Don't give the farmer his fun, fun, fun

673
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:18,003
He'll get by without his rabbit pie

674
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:23,367
So run, rabbit, run, rabbit, run, run, run

675
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,400
Run, rabbit, run, rabbit...

676
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,451
Bang, bang, bang, bang
goes the farmer's gun

677
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,724
Don't give the farmer his fun, fun, fun

678
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:33,442
He'll get by without his rabbit pie

679
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,200
That was fantastic.

680
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,001
What was that?

681
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,844
It was my phone.

682
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,765
It's been dead the whole time
in the loop. I guess now...

683
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,251
Your phone?

684
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,491
Yeah. Like a telephone.

685
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,001
You can call people...

686
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,162
send written messages.

687
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,163
Wait, you'll love this.

688
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,924
You can take a picture.

689
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,367
Press that, there. Yeah.

690
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,001
See?

691
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,650
What's wrong?

692
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:51,682
It's just funny to think
that one day, you'll grow up.

693
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,046
Like Abe did.

694
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,366
Get married, have children.

695
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,681
Grandchildren.

696
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,602
You might even show them this photograph.

697
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,490
And I'll still be here.

698
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,607
Couldn't you leave some day?

699
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,525
And live in the present, if you wanted to?

700
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:11,681
No.

701
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:15,170
More than a few minutes in your time
and the years would catch up.

702
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,090
You would age?

703
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,762
I think it's the Ymbryne
from Horace's dream.

704
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:32,005
Are you sure it's not just a bird?

705
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,685
I don't know, wouldn't it change?

706
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:36,081
She can't. Not if she's hurt.

707
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,765
I need to take her inside. You should go.

708
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,680
Please don't say anything else.

709
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,330
I hate goodbyes.

710
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,241
I'll come back tomorrow.

711
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,842
There's no hurry. I'll be here forever.

712
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,441
Hey!

713
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:06,680
I've been all over this damn island.

714
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:07,886
Where the hell were you?

715
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,128
Um, I was just on my way back.

716
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,930
I'm sorry. I lost track of time.

717
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,440
I was having a blast
with Worm and Dirty D.

718
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,441
Dirty D?

719
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,726
You know what?

720
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,082
This is good. This is healthy.

721
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,924
You're making weird friends...

722
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,962
and doing teenage stuff.

723
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,121
I think this is normal.

724
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,730
I'm sure Doctor Golan will approve.

725
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,609
Hey, you. American!

726
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:32,966
Get over here.

727
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:35,961
Oh, look. There they are.

728
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:39,329
There's D-Bag and Worm Man.

729
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,606
Did you do this?

730
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,321
What? No.

731
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:45,967
Of course not.

732
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,606
It wasn't us.

733
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,810
Listen, sir. I don't know
what happened here.

734
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:53,009
But my son and his friends
have been together all day.

735
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,447
Jake would never do anything like this.

736
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,125
Bollocks! We haven't seen him!

737
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,400
You paid us yesterday.

738
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,323
Why would we hang out
with him today for free?

739
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:06,164
Jake? Were you with them or not?

740
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,648
No. I'm sorry.

741
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,483
But you don't seriously
think I could do this?

742
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,324
I think we're done here, sir.

743
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:19,002
Can you pass on a message for me?

744
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,162
Can you tell Doctor Golan...

745
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,727
that if she hadn't encouraged
this cockamamie trip...

746
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:26,730
maybe my son wouldn't be moping
around all day in a derelict house...

747
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,723
having a goddamn breakdown!

748
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:30,841
Hello?

749
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,525
Dad, I'm not.

750
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:34,321
I'm fine.

751
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,209
No. You're not.

752
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,322
You're not fine, Jake.

753
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,011
Coming here was a terrible, terrible idea.

754
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,648
Look, I'm sorry I lied. I just wanted...

755
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,320
Just set your alarm for 8:00 a.m.

756
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,728
I wanna get to the beach early.

757
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,161
The rest of the time we're stuck
on this craphole island...

758
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,731
we're sticking together.

759
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,047
Where are you going?

760
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,248
Downstairs for a drink.

761
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,121
Dear Miss Peregrine...

762
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,404
I don't wish to alarm you...

763
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:54,131
but one of my informants sent me this.

764
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,406
It would appear that some
of Mr. Barron's group...

765
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,403
are in Blackpool, England.

766
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,965
If I recall...

767
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,441
Miss Avocet has a loop there.

768
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,003
Please warn her and suggest...

769
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,003
that she make a new one right away...

770
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:10,286
well-hidden.

771
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,011
And take the greatest care yourself.

772
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,924
With love, Abe.

773
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,082
January, 2016.

774
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,525
Who's ready to hit the beach?

775
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:38,926
Ugh.

776
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,690
Oh, my...

777
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:47,361
Unbelievable.

778
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:51,049
Right in the middle of a nesting area?

779
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,487
What kind of idiot does that?

780
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:57,684
Actually, the main
nesting area is over there.

781
00:56:58,280 --> 00:56:59,850
I can show you if you'd like.

782
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,207
It's marvelous to meet
a fellow bird spotter.

783
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:03,367
John Lamont.

784
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,642
Franklin Portman. This is my son, Jake.

785
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,521
John Lamont.

786
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,125
That's a hell of a camera you got there.

787
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:12,691
Oh, thanks. It's absolutely fantastic.

788
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:16,208
I'm here to do some snaps
for a book I'm writing.

789
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,203
So, you gentlemen here on holiday?

790
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:25,280
Unfortunately, her wings
were flapping as much as the bird's!

791
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:29,721
I think you fellas are thinking
of another kind of bird.

792
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,041
So, you're not going to the beach today?

793
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,371
What's the point?

794
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,690
If that guy is gonna cover Cairnholm
in some big, glossy book...

795
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,490
no one's gonna even wanna look at mine.

796
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,923
Might just have a nice afternoon nap.

797
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:46,203
I don't suppose you saw Uncle Oggie
on your travels this morning, did you?

798
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,925
He's usually here by now.

799
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:49,206
I could go look for him.

800
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,410
You're not going anywhere.

801
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:29,447
Jake, you're back! Come and play!

802
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:31,601
Oh!

803
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,088
I need to see Miss Peregrine first.

804
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,605
Do you know where she is?

805
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,601
From the darkest days, the Canadian army...

806
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:45,571
Jake. You're back. How wonderful!

807
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,281
How's it doing?

808
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,251
Emma said it was an Ymbryne.

809
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,245
"She." Not "it."

810
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,289
Ymbrynes are always female.

811
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,851
And Emma was quite correct.

812
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,604
This is Miss Avocet.

813
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,565
Her loop's in Blackpool. England.

814
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:04,442
That was a private letter, Jake.

815
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,650
Who is Mr. Barron?

816
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:15,128
Miss Peregrine, if my Grandpa was
involved with dangerous people...

817
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,845
I need to tell the police.

818
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:19,121
Police?

819
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,687
Are you implying Abe
died an unnatural death?

820
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,804
I found him in the woods...

821
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,008
with his eyes missing.

822
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:29,003
I'd say that was pretty unnatural.

823
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:36,849
Unless essential,
I don't discuss unpleasant matters.

824
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,480
An Ymbryne's duty
is to protect children, Jake.

825
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,284
I'm not a child.

826
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,891
He wanted you to tell me everything!

827
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,848
Oh. How frustrating for you.

828
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,725
Between Miss Peregrine's rules...

829
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,882
and my housemates'
little pact not to scare you off...

830
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,168
it's like no one's telling you anything!

831
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:02,320
Why don't you, then?

832
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,845
It's not like you want me here.

833
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,840
Enoch, you can't. You promised.

834
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,206
Olive's right.

835
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:12,725
I do know someone who can get away
with breaking rules though.

836
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,646
Want to meet him?

837
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:18,651
Enoch, don't do this. Please!

838
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:21,361
You want to spend time with me
and Jake, we can all play together.

839
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:22,851
That's what you said.

840
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:25,929
Here we all are.

841
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,884
Move, Olive.

842
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:32,681
If you're going to be like that,
then I don't want to be your friend.

843
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:39,411
Enoch, leave Victor alone.
It really upsets Bronwyn.

844
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,360
Stop fussing, Fiona.

845
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,044
Don't you think Jake
should meet everybody?

846
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,730
He's trying to frighten you away, Jake.

847
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,690
He was always jealous of Abe.
And now he's jealous of you.

848
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,251
Come and play with us instead.

849
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,284
I'd quite like to meet Victor.

850
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,086
After you.

851
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:13,647
Hello, Victor.

852
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:17,889
I'm Jake. I'm sorry to disturb...

853
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:22,800
Yeah, he can't hear you.

854
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,169
Hello, Jake. I'm Victor.

855
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,691
Do you want to know what killed me?

856
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:01,483
There you are. Is Enoch with you?

857
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,090
It's time for our daily walk.

858
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:08,481
Emma, who killed Victor?

859
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,324
Was it the people with the white eyes?

860
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,130
I asked you not to ask questions.

861
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:15,284
I saw one the night my grandpa died.

862
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,487
A man.

863
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:21,204
If it really was one,
you have to tell Miss Peregrine.

864
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,488
Could you recognize him from a photograph?

865
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:25,051
Do you have one?

866
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:28,328
Come on. There's somewhere
I go to be alone.

867
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:29,885
I have things there.

868
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:08,526
Is this the place?

869
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,882
No. This is how we get there.

870
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,243
Oh! Emma! Your shoes!

871
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,845
Lead shoes!

872
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:37,365
Welcome to my secret hideout.

873
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:41,480
How did you...

874
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:42,641
Air.

875
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:45,010
It's my peculiarity.

876
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:47,529
It does what I want.

877
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:07,766
Jake...

878
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,570
before your grandfather retired...

879
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:11,882
he asked me to keep this safe.

880
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:31,371
This is my grandpa's old map.

881
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,090
It shows you where the loops are.

882
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:45,930
That's him!

883
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,764
That's the man I saw.

884
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,929
- Who is he?
- That's Barron.

885
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:51,081
He's the leader.

886
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:53,765
The leader of what?

887
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:55,806
Who are these people?

888
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:59,924
Bad people. Bad peculiars.

889
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:03,610
Abe dedicated his life
to hunting them down.

890
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,603
These are the ones he never found.

891
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:08,283
What do you mean, hunting?

892
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,089
They raided loops.

893
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:16,642
Whole homes full of children
left for dead.

894
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:19,327
Abe took lives to save lives.

895
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:22,324
He only retired when you were
born to protect you.

896
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:24,481
From what?

897
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:31,848
If I tell you the rest,
you have to promise not to run away.

898
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:36,129
Jake, you belong here.

899
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:37,685
You know I don't.

900
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,808
I'm not like you.

901
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:41,766
I'm just ordinary.

902
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:43,285
No, you're not.

903
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:44,487
Jake...

904
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:47,530
only a peculiar can enter a time loop.

905
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,162
No. That can't be right.

906
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,211
I would know.

907
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:56,161
Fine.

908
01:07:58,160 --> 01:07:59,844
Then I'll show you something else.

909
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:08,481
Hurry. You'll miss it.

910
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:25,688
Ymbrynes usually pick the
perfect day to create a loop.

911
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:27,808
But Miss Peregrine had to
make this one in a rush.

912
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:30,081
Why?

913
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,722
Because the Germans were about
to drop a bomb on the house.

914
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:34,365
The point is...

915
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:37,364
September the 3rd, 1943 wasn't perfect.

916
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:40,921
The thing that killed Victor came back.

917
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:09,127
Wait! Watch out!

918
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:11,120
You'll put her off!

919
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:41,404
You can see it, can't you?

920
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,445
No one else can.

921
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,082
It's invisible, Jake.

922
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:47,645
That was Abe's greatest gift of all.

923
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,450
He could see the monsters.

924
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,762
We call them Hollowgast.

925
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,121
Hollows for short.

926
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:05,931
My grandpa told me about people
who turn into monsters.

927
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:07,445
Is that what they are?

928
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,448
I will explain everything, Jake.

929
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,768
I fear it's my duty now, considering.

930
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:15,126
But you should know that in doing so,
I'm breaking a solemn promise.

931
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,968
I knew you were peculiar
when you were born.

932
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,847
But your grandfather forbid me
to tell you anything.

933
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,322
His dearest wish was for you
to have an ordinary childhood.

934
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:28,649
I definitely had that.

935
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,326
He intended to tell you
the truth when you turned 18.

936
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:36,323
He hoped his bedtime stories
would pave the way.

937
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,047
Ah.

938
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:39,525
Here's my book.

939
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,370
Many years ago...

940
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:55,805
a splinter faction emerged
among our people.

941
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,531
Disaffected peculiars
tired of living in loops.

942
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:01,646
That's Mr. Barron.

943
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:05,564
He believed that by harnessing
the essence of an Ymbryne's powers...

944
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:08,485
he and his cronies
could gain immortality...

945
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:11,007
and be able to live outside loops.

946
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,328
He devised an experiment.

947
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,320
He kidnapped an Ymbryne...

948
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:21,363
not knowing or caring whether she
would survive the experiment.

949
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:46,291
But the fate of Barron and his group
was more horrifying still.

950
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,921
Why didn't Barron turn into one?

951
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:40,811
He did.

952
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,604
But years later...

953
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:44,967
he found a way to reverse the effects.

954
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,610
To regain humanity.

955
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:50,128
They had become not
immortal gods, but Hollows.

956
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:52,601
Invisible beasts, dangerous...

957
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,802
cold-blooded, deadly.

958
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:56,485
Remember I told you they raided loops?

959
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:58,846
This is why.

960
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:03,682
Barron discovered that by consuming
the eyes of other peculiars...

961
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,968
especially children...

962
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,010
he began to change.

963
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:36,484
Consume enough, and a Hollow can
fully regain its human form.

964
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:38,011
Bon appetit.

965
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:41,047
Just as Barron
and some of his friends did.

966
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,007
Mmm.

967
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:52,169
The rest of them are stuck as Hollows.

968
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:58,202
Are you saying that Barron ate my grand...

969
01:13:58,360 --> 01:13:59,885
He needs no more eyes himself.

970
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:03,846
But I fear he led a Hollow
to your grandfather. Yes.

971
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:08,007
After the first attacks on loops...

972
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:10,527
we all got better at hiding,
making new loops,

973
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,210
keeping our whereabouts secret.

974
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:15,881
The Hollows grow more
desperate every year...

975
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:18,691
and Barron wishes to help his friends.

976
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:21,081
Miss Peregrine, come quickly.
Miss Avocet's awake.

977
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,450
And suddenly, I flew into it again...

978
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,841
Bang! Bang! I couldn't see anything.

979
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,880
Oh, Miss Peregrine.
They found my new loop.

980
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:34,930
The children. I tried to save them...

981
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:36,684
but there were so many Hollows.

982
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:38,569
I don't know how I escaped.

983
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:42,241
You're safe now.

984
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,243
None of us are safe.

985
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,368
They set up the machine in my loop.

986
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,522
They put it in the cellars
at Blackpool Tower.

987
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:49,920
They're still there.

988
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:51,923
- Their machine?
- The experiment.

989
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:54,526
They intend to do it again.

990
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:56,762
This time, he's using more Ymbrynes.

991
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:58,809
He still wants to be immortal.

992
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:04,803
Do Hollows only attack peculiars?

993
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:06,200
Of course not.

994
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,326
They're monsters, Jake.

995
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:10,602
They'll slaughter anything in their path.

996
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:13,047
Some sheep on the island were killed.

997
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,807
You don't think they're here
already, do you?

998
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,243
Have you seen anyone with white eyes?

999
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,768
I'm sorry, children. We can't remain here.

1000
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:25,921
What?

1001
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:28,282
We'll leave on the first ferry off
the island tomorrow.

1002
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:30,124
Pack anything of importance.

1003
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:31,969
Then it's sandwiches and early to bed.

1004
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:33,451
Are we leaving for good?

1005
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,284
- When are we coming back?
- Never.

1006
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:38,011
If Miss Peregrine's not here
to reset the loop tomorrow night...

1007
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:39,161
the house gets bombed.

1008
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:40,481
But our house.

1009
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:41,720
Don't cry.

1010
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:44,086
Miss Peregrine will find you another
lovely house, somewhere else.

1011
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:53,449
Once this loop closes, that's it.

1012
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,409
I can't get back to my own time.

1013
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:57,450
You didn't seem very happy there.

1014
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:00,968
I can't just leave! I have a family!

1015
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:02,525
And you felt ordinary.

1016
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:05,126
Like, nothing you do changes anything!

1017
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:08,405
Now you have a chance to do
something that changes everything!

1018
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:11,322
Jake, we're in danger.

1019
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:13,960
And you're the only one
who can see the Hollows.

1020
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:17,169
Yeah, see them, sure.
But I'm not my grandpa!

1021
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:20,367
I'm not, and I can't fight.

1022
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:22,124
I can't kill somebody.

1023
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:28,571
There's only one reason
that I'd stay here...

1024
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:29,721
Please.

1025
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:32,285
Just go.

1026
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:03,371
Jake? Jakey, there you are.

1027
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:04,567
Thank God!

1028
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:06,967
When I heard they found a body, I freaked.

1029
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,284
Are there stray dogs around here?

1030
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:35,121
What you talking about?

1031
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:38,210
It's like...

1032
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:42,002
when they find an injured animal,
they go for the soft parts first.

1033
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:45,084
Same thing happened to my father.

1034
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:48,047
The police are on their way.

1035
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:50,446
Look, Dad. I've gotta go.

1036
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:52,688
What? No. You don't, Jake.

1037
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:55,607
If this wasn't an accident,
there's a lunatic on the island.

1038
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:58,851
I've known everyone
on this island my whole life.

1039
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,889
Except you, and him.

1040
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:02,726
And he's been in the pub all afternoon.

1041
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:04,803
So have I. I was sleeping.

1042
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:06,610
What about the blind fellow?

1043
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:09,161
I assumed he was blind.

1044
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:10,890
Gentleman with the dark glasses...

1045
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:13,048
arrived on the same ferry as me?

1046
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:15,089
I kept seeing him around.

1047
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:16,847
Jake!

1048
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:18,647
Jake!

1049
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:22,449
Jake! Wait!

1050
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:28,245
Is your son all right?

1051
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:29,400
No.

1052
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:32,802
He has mental health issues.

1053
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:34,000
I can't go.

1054
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,481
Let me. I run 5-Ks all the time.

1055
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:51,401
Hello?

1056
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:57,087
Hello?

1057
01:18:58,120 --> 01:18:59,451
Is that you, young man?

1058
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:02,531
You came through...

1059
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:04,845
You're peculiar?

1060
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:07,121
Oh, yes.

1061
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:11,044
And I'm extremely grateful to you.

1062
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:14,240
Terribly hard to find loops these days.

1063
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:18,010
So, you followed me from
the beach on purpose?

1064
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:19,806
Oh, no.

1065
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:23,324
I've been following you
much further than that.

1066
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,090
Doctor Golan?

1067
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:31,681
Sometimes.

1068
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:33,731
When it suits me.

1069
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:37,450
The breadth of my peculiarity...

1070
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:40,524
is purely limited by my imagination.

1071
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:43,647
The only thing I can't change...

1072
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:48,329
is my eyes.

1073
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:56,800
Mr. Barron. How do you do?

1074
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:03,289
I saw you at your grandfather's.

1075
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:06,367
I was hoping to get
Miss Peregrine's address from him.

1076
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:10,249
But, alas, my traveling companion
got to him before I did.

1077
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:12,166
As you know...

1078
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:15,880
there's just no stopping
a hungry Hollowgast!

1079
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:22,324
Speaking of my traveling companion...

1080
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:24,927
he's coming.

1081
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:27,926
Believe me when I say to you...

1082
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:30,924
you don't want to be here...

1083
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:33,128
when he arrives.

1084
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:37,643
So, let's be on our way.

1085
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:39,807
Shall we?

1086
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:46,845
Excuse me.

1087
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:52,807
Wait for me.

1088
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:58,366
I mustn't forget our calendar.

1089
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,841
Could you fetch it from the parlor
please, Miss Avocet?

1090
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:06,165
Go and help the others.

1091
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:22,966
Miss Peregrine, what a pleasure
to meet you at last!

1092
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:26,049
May we come in?

1093
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:34,046
Children!

1094
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:37,364
Would you make your way
down the stairs, please?

1095
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:40,285
I give the orders
in this house, Mr. Barron.

1096
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:41,521
Not today.

1097
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,482
You should know that Jake
has served his purpose.

1098
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:49,841
If you value his life, I suggest
everyone does as they're told.

1099
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,570
- Children!
- Shush!

1100
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:55,371
No one tells my children what to do!

1101
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:58,041
Children...

1102
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:00,408
come down here, please.

1103
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:04,760
Miss Peregrine...

1104
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:06,683
I thought I told you to be quiet.

1105
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:10,641
Children...

1106
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,768
for Jake's safety...

1107
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:15,400
we're going to do what Mr. Barron asks.

1108
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:18,890
He wishes to take me with him
to his rendezvous in Blackpool.

1109
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:20,644
So, for his protection...

1110
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,765
he'd like me to assume bird
form, preferably caged.

1111
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:27,525
He'd like you to make your way into
a lockable room, such as the parlor...

1112
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:29,320
as he won't release Jake if he fears

1113
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:30,765
an attack could be mounted upon him...

1114
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:32,644
once he loses his leverage.

1115
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:34,606
Correct, Mr. Barron?

1116
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:40,006
You're sacrificing yourself
and all of us for Jake?

1117
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:42,845
Mr. Barron travels with a Hollow, Enoch.

1118
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,049
Once it arrives here, we're all dead.

1119
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:50,809
Enoch. Only Jake can see them.

1120
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:52,962
She means he's our only hope.

1121
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:39,129
It's been my privilege...

1122
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:41,690
to care for you all.

1123
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:45,645
Goodbye, my children.

1124
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:56,561
Now let him go.

1125
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:21,086
Promise me one thing, Jake.

1126
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:27,087
That you will try to look after them all.

1127
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:32,325
I promise.

1128
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:04,611
Boo!

1129
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:09,801
It's getting dark.

1130
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:12,043
You won't even be able
to see their shadows.

1131
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:13,280
We have to stay inside.

1132
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,964
It's the only place we stand a chance.

1133
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:18,445
He's quite right. Now, where does
Miss Peregrine keep her weapon?

1134
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:20,405
In there. Let's go.

1135
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:21,971
Now, all right, children.

1136
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:25,044
Make sure all the doors are locked,
and the windows are latched.

1137
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:27,487
Everything must be
sealed up tight. Now quickly.

1138
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,800
Quickly! Go!

1139
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:40,487
Here.

1140
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:46,851
Jake, I think tonight,
you better answer that.

1141
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,001
Okay.

1142
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:53,480
Hello?

1143
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:54,720
Hello, this is Abe.

1144
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:55,926
Who's that?

1145
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:03,564
You don't know me yet. I'm Jake.

1146
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:06,923
Ah, you're new.
Welcome to the family, Jake.

1147
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:08,525
Now, I can't talk long...

1148
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:10,006
so just tell Miss Peregrine...

1149
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:12,162
I'm at the air base, and I'm fine.

1150
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:18,761
I just wanted to say that I miss you...

1151
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:21,568
and if I disappointed you...

1152
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:23,165
I'm sorry.

1153
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:26,924
You're the best grandpa in the world.

1154
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:41,570
Quickly.

1155
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,124
- Fiona.
- Got it.

1156
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:55,241
Miss Avocet.

1157
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:57,161
Now, children.

1158
01:26:57,320 --> 01:26:59,448
Now that you're all here,
there's a few rules.

1159
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,967
Your primary job is to stay safe.

1160
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:03,406
Leave the Hollow to me.

1161
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:05,403
I don't want to see any heroics.

1162
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:08,203
Now those of you with garden tools...

1163
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:10,522
I must insist that you...

1164
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:34,771
No, Enoch. Get back!

1165
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:37,286
Whoa!

1166
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:02,207
Go. Get to the attic!

1167
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:03,400
Come on!

1168
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:07,321
Take her.

1169
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,409
Go. Get out!

1170
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:25,601
Olive, come on!

1171
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:42,207
Okay.

1172
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:43,601
All right, uh...

1173
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,604
Crap! It's almost reset!

1174
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:52,681
Fiona, is there anything
you can do with that tree?

1175
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:54,524
- Yes.
- Be careful.

1176
01:28:57,960 --> 01:28:59,240
We're going through the windows.

1177
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:00,560
Let's go! Quickly!

1178
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:25,881
Come on!

1179
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:38,170
Claire, come on down.

1180
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:57,161
Come on!

1181
01:29:57,680 --> 01:29:59,444
Be careful.

1182
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:13,405
Go, Fiona!

1183
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:22,161
Let's go!

1184
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:47,969
- Was that...
- The loop closing.

1185
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:50,686
It's gone.

1186
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:13,160
I'm sorry, Jake.

1187
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:15,689
What do we do now?

1188
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:19,282
Is there any sign of Barron
and Miss Peregrine?

1189
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:22,644
Gone. Barron must have had a boat.

1190
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:28,850
We have to go after them.

1191
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:31,124
We know he's taking her to Blackpool.

1192
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:33,123
But Blackpool is miles away.

1193
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:34,520
The next ferry doesn't go for hours.

1194
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:35,840
We'll never make it in time.

1195
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,568
Not unless we go by boat, too.

1196
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:28,009
So, there's a loop here in Blackpool.

1197
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:31,568
It's only six months old.
January 11th, 2016.

1198
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:34,530
With Miss Avocet gone, it can't be reset.

1199
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:36,489
Won't the loop close?

1200
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:38,730
Then it's back to real time.

1201
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:43,042
Jake, you know what this means, don't you?

1202
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:44,881
You're gonna die.

1203
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:46,929
That's not what I mean.

1204
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:49,561
We have to get to our own time,
but you don't.

1205
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:53,682
You can continue to live in 2016.

1206
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,444
But why would I do that?

1207
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:57,204
If we kill Barron...

1208
01:33:57,400 --> 01:34:00,051
he'll be gone, but time will carry on.

1209
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:02,569
He won't go to Florida...

1210
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:07,200
Abe won't die, and you can go home.

1211
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:11,087
I could see my grandpa.

1212
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:18,246
Listen, I can explain everything to them.

1213
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:21,370
I can persuade them
to take me to the island and...

1214
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:23,568
Wait, will you still be there?

1215
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:27,407
Our old loop's gone for good.

1216
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:30,368
We wouldn't see each other again.

1217
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:34,242
I thought you wanted me to stay.

1218
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:39,201
I know you'll choose Abe.

1219
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:42,764
If I minded, I wouldn't have told you.

1220
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:54,606
So, have you found Miss Avocet's
loop on the map yet?

1221
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:57,323
It's here. But it's new.

1222
01:34:57,480 --> 01:34:59,960
She made it early this year.
That's my year.

1223
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:03,400
If we don't get out before it closes,
we're stuck in January 2016.

1224
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:04,520
Great.

1225
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:08,283
Time catches up with all of us,
we all die, except you. Plan?

1226
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:10,489
The loop closes at 4:30.

1227
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:13,291
That means we need to get in,
rescue the Ymbrynes and then get out.

1228
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:16,088
Yeah, if we're not already dead.

1229
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:19,167
Miss Avocet said the machine is in the
cellar of the Blackpool Tower building.

1230
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:22,085
That means we will be
indoors... with Hollows.

1231
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:24,607
No, we won't. I've got a plan.

1232
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:26,285
But I'm gonna need your help.

1233
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:58,530
This can't be it, can it?

1234
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:01,080
Loop entrances can be anywhere.

1235
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:03,367
The one in London's in a subway tunnel.

1236
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:17,371
Are you sure this is it?

1237
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,209
I think so.

1238
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:26,407
Millard, there's something
I need you to do first.

1239
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:28,881
All right. I know.

1240
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:34,766
Look. There's the tower. It's not far.

1241
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:37,605
Easy for you to say. I'm freezing.

1242
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:44,881
Ready?

1243
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:58,201
All of the doors to the cellar are locked.

1244
01:36:58,360 --> 01:36:59,885
The only way to reach
the Ymbrynes is through there.

1245
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:02,371
It's backstage.

1246
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:04,568
How many Hollows can you see?

1247
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:07,363
Four. That's good news.

1248
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:10,924
I think you and I have a very
different definition of good news.

1249
01:37:11,080 --> 01:37:14,243
It means Barron's other friends
haven't arrived yet.

1250
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:16,084
So they haven't started the experiment.

1251
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:18,405
We're not too late.

1252
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:21,241
Okay, Emma.

1253
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,649
You ready? You know what to say.

1254
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:25,131
Here, Jake.

1255
01:37:27,560 --> 01:37:31,042
Our brethren should be
joining us momentarily.

1256
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:32,810
- This is a day to...
- Hey!

1257
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:34,485
You down there!

1258
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:37,080
We killed your Hollow friend, Mr. Barron.

1259
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:39,766
And now we've come for Miss Peregrine.

1260
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:43,608
Bring her and all the other Ymbrynes
to the end of the pier in five minutes...

1261
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:45,489
or face the consequences.

1262
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:53,328
These children must be as insane
as their headmistress.

1263
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:57,811
Still, the Hollows will be glad of a feed.

1264
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:02,290
Where are you?

1265
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,810
I know you're in here somewhere!

1266
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:08,720
A-ha!

1267
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:10,928
Good. Listen to me.

1268
01:38:11,080 --> 01:38:14,971
I want you to follow
Mr. Archer and Mr. Clark.

1269
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:16,849
They're going to take you
down to the pier...

1270
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:20,163
for a little afternoon tea.

1271
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:23,008
Mr. Archer, Mr. Clark...

1272
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:25,208
gather the Hollows
and take them to the pier.

1273
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:27,761
Those children killed Malthus?

1274
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:31,169
Barron's had it in for Malthus
ever since he killed Abe Portman.

1275
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:33,322
I tracked Abe Portman for months.

1276
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:37,010
All I needed was a few minutes...

1277
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:40,050
to get the location of Miss
Peregrine's loop from him.

1278
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:41,486
But no!

1279
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:43,523
Malthus couldn't wait.

1280
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,161
Instead...

1281
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:49,567
I had to masquerade as a psychiatrist...

1282
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:52,121
for three weeks...

1283
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:53,685
in Florida!

1284
01:38:55,640 --> 01:38:57,529
Have you ever been to Florida?

1285
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:04,404
Did I not tell you to gather the Hollows?

1286
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:05,561
What if it's a trap?

1287
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:07,848
Of course, it is, Miss Edwards.
But what of it?

1288
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:10,407
A couple of children against four Hollows.

1289
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:12,085
Let's get this over with.

1290
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:32,721
Jake, I'm stuck!

1291
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:40,241
Hurry up!

1292
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:42,760
Come on.

1293
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:45,850
Watch out!

1294
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:02,840
They're coming!

1295
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:18,921
Let's go.

1296
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:28,884
Enoch. Now!

1297
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:48,641
Go! Now!

1298
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:02,961
Starting to see them now.

1299
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:06,961
Phase two.

1300
01:41:12,120 --> 01:41:13,121
Emma, go.

1301
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:18,808
Don't just stand there. Get them!

1302
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:08,570
All right. Good job, guys.
It's time for step two.

1303
01:43:08,720 --> 01:43:10,131
Save Miss Peregrine!

1304
01:43:10,280 --> 01:43:11,805
That's sort of step three.

1305
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:13,604
First, we've got to deal with Barron.

1306
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:15,811
Come on.

1307
01:43:17,960 --> 01:43:19,769
They should've been back by now.

1308
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:21,325
I said it was a trap.

1309
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:22,970
If that's true...

1310
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:26,810
perhaps we should move the Ymbrynes now.

1311
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:28,325
You're not serious?

1312
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:30,801
Do I not look serious?

1313
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:34,328
Do I not look like a man
who has searched the globe...

1314
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:37,000
looking for just one more eye to eat...

1315
01:43:37,640 --> 01:43:39,961
in hopes of regaining
sufficient humanity...

1316
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:42,248
to return to his research?

1317
01:43:42,440 --> 01:43:45,011
A man who's spent years
hunting Ymbrynes...

1318
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:48,004
in preparation for this night...

1319
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:50,965
and two, no, three days, in Wales...

1320
01:43:51,160 --> 01:43:53,686
pretending to look at birds!

1321
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:55,205
I assure you...

1322
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:57,601
I will not stand idly by...

1323
01:43:58,640 --> 01:44:02,167
to see my destiny derailed.

1324
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:10,166
Hugh, do it now!

1325
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:25,841
Come back here!

1326
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:27,001
Get them!

1327
01:44:34,840 --> 01:44:35,841
Go. Get down!

1328
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:41,688
You think you can stand in my way?

1329
01:44:42,160 --> 01:44:46,051
You, Jake, content to age and die...

1330
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:49,960
as if you had not the gift
of peculiarity at all?

1331
01:44:55,240 --> 01:44:58,562
I am a higher being.

1332
01:44:58,720 --> 01:45:01,883
I hold the secret to eternal life!

1333
01:45:02,040 --> 01:45:03,201
Sorry to interrupt.

1334
01:45:03,720 --> 01:45:05,210
What the...

1335
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:17,521
Bronwyn.

1336
01:45:22,680 --> 01:45:23,680
Huh!

1337
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:25,250
You missed me again, Jake.

1338
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:28,563
I take it accuracy
is not your peculiarity.

1339
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:42,362
Abe was a much worthier adversary.

1340
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:47,762
Don't let him get to the birds.

1341
01:45:57,240 --> 01:45:58,969
Ooh. Hmm.

1342
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:02,245
You must put me in contact
with your tailor.

1343
01:46:04,280 --> 01:46:07,966
Ymbrynes, Ymbrynes! Here I come!

1344
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:21,401
Cold?

1345
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:23,967
Wait till the blood freezes in your veins.

1346
01:46:24,120 --> 01:46:25,246
Hey!

1347
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:30,608
That was your attempt
to rescue your friend, was it?

1348
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:56,687
Jake.

1349
01:46:56,840 --> 01:46:58,046
I'll hold him off as long as I can.

1350
01:46:58,200 --> 01:47:01,449
When are you going to realize
you are a terrible shot with that thing.

1351
01:47:03,280 --> 01:47:04,805
Get the others.
I'll meet you at the loop entrance.

1352
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:19,561
Let's get you out.

1353
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:50,046
Eventually...

1354
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:52,680
you're going to run out of breath.

1355
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:56,049
And it'll all be over!

1356
01:47:56,240 --> 01:47:59,847
Death for your beloved
Jake and Miss Peregrine...

1357
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,243
everlasting life for me!

1358
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:05,686
Ew!

1359
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:08,367
And a mint for you.

1360
01:49:02,280 --> 01:49:04,089
Olive.

1361
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:10,290
I'm so sorry, Olive.

1362
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:14,129
All these years, I never appreciated you.

1363
01:49:15,640 --> 01:49:17,449
I didn't see how lucky I was.

1364
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:23,082
I got so used to having you
there, I never realized...

1365
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:31,960
You never realized what?

1366
01:50:22,040 --> 01:50:24,486
Find your children. Create new loops.

1367
01:50:27,880 --> 01:50:29,245
So, Jake...

1368
01:50:29,400 --> 01:50:32,722
I see you've inherited your
grandfather's peculiarity.

1369
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:35,167
You're just as annoying as he was.

1370
01:50:38,240 --> 01:50:39,890
Speaking of Abe...

1371
01:50:40,360 --> 01:50:42,840
if you should see him in the afterlife...

1372
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:45,200
give him my regards.

1373
01:50:53,720 --> 01:50:56,087
Please. We can't risk him
taking you again.

1374
01:51:15,120 --> 01:51:16,770
Enoch! Where are the others?

1375
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:18,729
They're safe. Olive is leading them
back to the Ghost Train.

1376
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:20,769
Jake needs us. Barron's too strong.

1377
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:29,930
You've lost Miss Peregrine.

1378
01:51:30,280 --> 01:51:32,487
You've lost everything. It's over.

1379
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:47,126
Jake?

1380
01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:52,640
Jake?

1381
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:57,766
Jake?

1382
01:52:04,440 --> 01:52:05,646
Emma?

1383
01:52:05,800 --> 01:52:07,720
No, wait. Look.
That's not me. It's Barron.

1384
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:08,801
Don't listen to him.

1385
01:52:08,920 --> 01:52:10,081
- He's Barron.
- No, I'm Jake.

1386
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:11,326
That's Barron.

1387
01:52:11,960 --> 01:52:13,485
I've got a better shot than Jake.

1388
01:52:13,640 --> 01:52:15,324
So, neither of you move
until we sort this.

1389
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:16,845
Listen to me. I'm Jake.

1390
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:19,771
I grew up in Florida and
I wanted to be an explorer.

1391
01:52:19,960 --> 01:52:22,201
I thought nothing would ever change
because I was ordinary.

1392
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:24,210
That's Jake. Get Barron.

1393
01:52:24,360 --> 01:52:25,486
No. Look. I told him all of this.

1394
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:26,886
She was my psychiatrist.

1395
01:52:27,480 --> 01:52:29,687
Look, you deal with him.
I'll go find Miss Peregrine.

1396
01:52:38,160 --> 01:52:39,161
Wait.

1397
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:42,322
Look, I can prove that I'm me...

1398
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:45,043
because I'm not ordinary.

1399
01:52:47,560 --> 01:52:49,847
I can do something no one else can

1400
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:00,687
I can see the monsters.

1401
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:10,000
No, wait. It's me!

1402
01:53:27,240 --> 01:53:28,287
Enoch!

1403
01:53:44,240 --> 01:53:46,766
We need to go. The loop is closing.

1404
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:49,081
Yeah.

1405
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:51,126
Those of us who are leaving.

1406
01:54:57,320 --> 01:54:58,321
Emma.

1407
01:54:58,440 --> 01:54:59,646
You love your grandfather.

1408
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:01,650
There's nothing more to explain.

1409
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:05,289
No, I promised Miss Peregrine
I'd look after you all.

1410
01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:07,602
And with her injured,
and you without a loop...

1411
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:09,046
She'll recover.

1412
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:12,969
Until then, we'll be in 1943.

1413
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:15,920
We'll only age one day at a time.

1414
01:55:16,080 --> 01:55:17,320
Like normal people.

1415
01:55:18,120 --> 01:55:19,451
Which can be no bad thing.

1416
01:55:19,640 --> 01:55:21,688
What about the Hollows?

1417
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:24,286
As long as they're out there,
you're not safe.

1418
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:28,045
We don't need you
to make us feel safe, Jake.

1419
01:55:28,720 --> 01:55:31,530
Because you made us feel brave.

1420
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:33,490
And that's even better.

1421
01:56:36,440 --> 01:56:38,886
Come on, guys. Let's go.

1422
01:57:13,280 --> 01:57:14,520
Tygrysku.

1423
01:57:22,080 --> 01:57:24,526
And then we said goodbye...

1424
01:57:25,200 --> 01:57:27,089
and the loop closed.

1425
01:57:28,360 --> 01:57:31,170
I was so scared that you wouldn't be here.

1426
01:57:32,960 --> 01:57:34,849
That I'd never see you again.

1427
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:37,330
I'm safe.

1428
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:39,283
Oh.

1429
01:57:40,640 --> 01:57:43,450
Let me give you your birthday present.

1430
01:57:44,480 --> 01:57:46,323
Grandpa, my birthday isn't for months.

1431
01:57:51,320 --> 01:57:53,322
For your travels.

1432
01:57:54,480 --> 01:57:56,050
Go to her, Jake.

1433
01:57:57,640 --> 01:57:59,324
You have the map.

1434
01:57:59,480 --> 01:58:02,484
You can get back to 1943.

1435
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,651
No. Even so, they took a boat.

1436
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:09,564
I don't know where they are.

1437
01:58:11,680 --> 01:58:14,160
But you know where they were.

1438
01:58:53,040 --> 01:58:56,886
You have no idea how long
it took me to get here.

1439
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,048
The closest loop
was in the California desert.

1440
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,287
I used it to get to the Tokyo loop.

1441
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:19,928
And that led me to the nearest
loop back in 1942...

1442
01:59:20,080 --> 01:59:22,208
where I wound up joining the Navy.

1443
01:59:22,360 --> 01:59:23,885
Don't ask.

1444
01:59:24,040 --> 01:59:25,963
Then I spent two months
in London trying to...

1445
01:59:53,280 --> 01:59:56,250
Ready for full speed ahead!

1446
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:37,882
I tried to leave it all behind me

1447
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:42,483
But I woke up
And there they were beside me

1448
02:00:45,160 --> 02:00:49,484
And I don't believe it
But I guess it's true

1449
02:00:50,280 --> 02:00:54,400
Some feelings, they can travel, too

1450
02:00:54,480 --> 02:00:59,600
Oh, there it is again, sitting on my chest

1451
02:00:59,680 --> 02:01:02,206
Makes it hard to catch my breath

1452
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:06,006
I scramble for the light of change

1453
02:01:08,040 --> 02:01:11,249
You're always on my mind

1454
02:01:13,200 --> 02:01:16,249
You're always on my mind

1455
02:01:16,360 --> 02:01:20,251
And I never minded being on my own

1456
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:25,160
Then something broke in me
and I wanted to go home

1457
02:01:25,240 --> 02:01:28,687
To be where you are

1458
02:01:29,240 --> 02:01:34,883
But even closer to you
You seem so very far

1459
02:01:36,040 --> 02:01:40,409
And now I'm reaching out
with every note I sing

1460
02:01:41,040 --> 02:01:45,204
And I hope it gets to you
on some Pacific wind

1461
02:01:45,360 --> 02:01:50,161
Wraps itself around you
and whispers in your ear

1462
02:01:50,280 --> 02:01:55,730
Tells you that I miss you
and I wish that you were here

1463
02:02:06,240 --> 02:02:08,840
And if I stay home, I don't know

1464
02:02:08,920 --> 02:02:12,925
There'll be so much
that I'll have to let go

1465
02:02:13,440 --> 02:02:17,081
You disappear in all the time

1466
02:02:17,920 --> 02:02:22,130
But I still see you in the light

1467
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:26,442
For you, the shadows fight

1468
02:02:26,560 --> 02:02:30,400
And it's beautiful but there's
that tug in the sight

1469
02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:37,045
I must stop time traveling
You're always on my mind

1470
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:42,762
You're always on my mind

1471
02:02:44,600 --> 02:02:47,520
You're always on my mind

1472
02:02:47,600 --> 02:02:52,040
And I never minded being on my own

1473
02:02:52,120 --> 02:02:56,400
Then something broke in me
and I wanted to go home

1474
02:02:56,480 --> 02:02:59,484
To be where you are

1475
02:03:00,600 --> 02:03:06,642
But even closer to you
You seem so very far

1476
02:03:07,320 --> 02:03:11,769
And now I'm reaching out
with every note I sing

1477
02:03:12,160 --> 02:03:16,484
And I hope it gets to you
on some Pacific wind

1478
02:03:16,600 --> 02:03:21,481
Wraps itself around you
and whispers in your ear

1479
02:03:21,600 --> 02:03:26,811
Tells you that I miss you
and I wish that you were here

1480
02:03:47,800 --> 02:03:52,203
We all need something watching over us

1481
02:03:52,640 --> 02:03:56,760
Be it the falcons, the clouds or the crows

1482
02:03:56,840 --> 02:04:02,961
And then the sea swept in
and left us all speechless

1483
02:04:03,680 --> 02:04:05,842
Speechless

1484
02:04:08,400 --> 02:04:12,405
And I never minded being on my own

1485
02:04:13,320 --> 02:04:17,405
Then something broke in me
and I wanted to go home

1486
02:04:18,360 --> 02:04:20,522
To be where you are

1487
02:04:21,520 --> 02:04:27,368
But even closer to you
You seem so very far

1488
02:04:28,320 --> 02:04:32,609
And now I'm reaching out
with every note I sing

1489
02:04:33,200 --> 02:04:37,480
And I hope it gets to you
on some Pacific wind

1490
02:04:37,560 --> 02:04:42,248
Wraps itself around you
and whispers in your ear

1491
02:04:42,520 --> 02:04:48,084
Tells you that I miss you
and I wish that you were here
