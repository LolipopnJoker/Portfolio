1
00:00:39,817 --> 00:00:45,000
Mummy got sick.
And it happened just like that.

2
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:49,379
There's nothing
anybody could do.

3
00:00:49,542 --> 00:00:53,332
It isn't fair.
There's no reason.

4
00:00:53,505 --> 00:00:59,214
And if we start asking why,
we'll go crazy.

5
00:01:21,574 --> 00:01:23,574
Five minutes in the microwave.

6
00:01:23,742 --> 00:01:26,491
Any one of them. Five minutes
and done, ready to eat.

7
00:01:28,413 --> 00:01:30,043
Do you know how to make juice?

8
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:36,674
Microwave.
Five minutes.

9
00:01:54,105 --> 00:01:58,614
Here. It's my shrink.
Call him.

10
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:10,619
Loss of Spouse Support Group.

11
00:02:11,997 --> 00:02:14,717
Chicago Cancer Family Network.

12
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:17,465
Parents without Partners.
Partners without Parents.

13
00:02:17,628 --> 00:02:21,998
"Hug Yourself,"
"Hug a Friend,"
"Hug a Shrink." Or work.

14
00:02:22,174 --> 00:02:28,093
Work hard, work will save you. Work is the
only thing that will see you through this.

15
00:02:33,142 --> 00:02:35,602
Don't mind him, he's just a guy
who's lost his wife.

16
00:02:42,443 --> 00:02:46,703
What I think we really
need is change.

17
00:02:46,864 --> 00:02:50,824
Good idea. Take a couple of weeks off,
get some sun, take Jonah fishing.

18
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,499
No, real change.
A new city.

19
00:02:59,542 --> 00:03:03,422
Some place where every time I go around
a corner I don't think of Maggie.

20
00:03:12,097 --> 00:03:13,347
<i>Where are you gonna go?</i>

21
00:03:18,645 --> 00:03:20,945
I was thinking about Seattle.

22
00:03:21,773 --> 00:03:26,783
Eventually, in a few months, you'll start
seeing women. You'll meet someone.

23
00:03:26,945 --> 00:03:30,074
Right, right. Move on, right,
that's.. that's what I'm gonna do.

24
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,739
And then in a few months, boom,
I'll be fine. I'll just grow a new heart.

25
00:03:34,243 --> 00:03:35,723
Sam, I'm sorry...
She didn't mean that.

26
00:03:35,786 --> 00:03:40,166
I know, I know. Look,
it just doesn't happen twice.

The tall one with red hair
is your cousin Irene.

48
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:34,909
You'll recognise her by the
disappointed look on her face.

49
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:37,868
Married to Harold, who ran
off with the secretary.

50
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:41,869
Who came back because Irene threatened
to put the dog to sleep if he didn't.

51
00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:46,873
Your brother Dennis is
professor at Johns Hopkins.

52
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:49,498
He's married to, uh, Betsy.

53
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:52,666
The most competitive woman
in the world.

54
00:05:52,835 --> 00:05:54,585
I don't see how I'm gonna
remember all this.

55
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:57,334
Oh, well, Walter, you will!

56
00:06:09,434 --> 00:06:11,814
Your Uncle Milton
lost all of his money.

57
00:06:11,979 --> 00:06:13,939
And some other people's.

58
00:06:14,106 --> 00:06:18,526
In a pyramid scheme. Don't mention the
IRS or the federal prisons system.

59
00:06:18,694 --> 00:06:21,194
Your mother's Barbara,
your father's Cliff

60
00:06:22,406 --> 00:06:26,286
- My father has electric trains.
- Really?

61
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:29,370
Am I what they had in mind?

62
00:06:29,537 --> 00:06:33,797
Oh, Walter,
they're gonna love you!

63
00:06:36,294 --> 00:06:39,544
Everybody,
Annie has an announcement.

64
00:06:39,714 --> 00:06:45,014
Oh... Walter and I are engaged.

65
00:06:49,932 --> 00:06:53,352
Thank you. Thank you.

66
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:55,769
Mum knew.
Dad, Mum knew.

67
00:06:55,938 --> 00:06:57,648
I don't see a ring, Annie.

68
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,689
Congratulations, Walter.

69
00:07:03,361 --> 00:07:05,321
Bless you. Bless you!

70
00:07:06,948 --> 00:07:10,448
- Are you all right?
- It's nothing. It's nothing.

71
00:07:10,619 --> 00:07:11,989
Maybe it's the flowers.

72
00:07:12,162 --> 00:07:13,202
We'll move them.

73
00:07:13,371 --> 00:07:17,831
No, don't touch them! I feel terrible,
sneezing at a time like this.

74
00:07:18,001 --> 00:07:19,711
This is a very important
moment for me.

75
00:07:19,878 --> 00:07:21,878
He's allergic to everything,
don't worry about him.

76
00:07:21,922 --> 00:07:24,672
Bees.
I'm allergic to bees.

77
00:07:24,841 --> 00:07:27,631
Harold is allergic to
every type of bee.

78
00:07:27,802 --> 00:07:31,351
We always have to carry a hypodermic
of adrenalin wherever we go.

79
00:07:31,513 --> 00:07:33,933
If he eats even one tiny
piece of a nut...

80
00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:37,473
My head swells up like a
watermelon and I drop dead.

81
00:07:37,847 --> 00:07:39,687
It's the same with Harold and bees.

82
00:07:39,897 --> 00:07:42,005
Your mother and I had
salmon at our wedding,

83
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,006
and I really think a wedding
without cold salmon is...

84
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,031
- I'm not allergic to salmon.
- Oh, he's not allergic to salmon.

85
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:51,078
I don't think.
But you never know.

86
00:07:51,158 --> 00:07:54,279
- You never know.
- Harold wasn't always allergic to bees.

87
00:07:54,335 --> 00:07:55,560
Oh, honey, what a shame.

88
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,185
We had some champagne.
What did we use it for?

89
00:07:58,282 --> 00:07:59,700
Uncle Milton's parole.

90
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,987
- And it was delicious.
- It was, wasn't it, Milton?

91
00:08:03,012 --> 00:08:07,722
- When are you getting married, Annie?
- In early June, in the garden.

92
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:09,900
Oh... In the garden.

93
00:08:10,017 --> 00:08:13,179
- What about Harold and bees?
- I'm allergic to bees.

94
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,689
We'll spray you.

95
00:08:14,806 --> 00:08:19,416
Cold salmon, a lovely
cucumber salad, strawberries.

96
00:08:19,534 --> 00:08:22,885
I'm afraid I am allergic
to strawberries.

97
00:08:24,764 --> 00:08:27,295
Is this all right with you Walter?

98
00:08:28,084 --> 00:08:30,521
Today, I'm consider myself the luckiest...

99
00:08:30,546 --> 00:08:33,927
man-man-man on the face
of the earth-earth-earth.

100
00:08:34,517 --> 00:08:35,977
The Lou Gehrig line from...

101
00:08:36,258 --> 00:08:39,922
Remember, Dad, the Lou
Gehrig line from, uh...

102
00:08:39,992 --> 00:08:41,847
- Pride of the Yankees.
- Pride of the Yankees.

103
00:08:41,872 --> 00:08:43,489
<i>Pride of the Yankees!
Yeah. Yeah.</i>

104
00:08:43,514 --> 00:08:46,224
Baseball. It's baseball.
Historical reference.

105
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:47,779
I would like to propose a toast.

106
00:08:47,804 --> 00:08:50,848
- Hear, hear.
- To my kid sister.

107
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:53,191
To Walter and my baby.

108
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:56,003
To Walter and Annie.

109
00:08:58,008 --> 00:09:01,847
Everyone, please eat
before it gets cold.

110
00:09:04,643 --> 00:09:08,752
Here it is. The Historical
Society wanted this

111
00:09:08,853 --> 00:09:10,447
and I never would
give it to them.

112
00:09:10,547 --> 00:09:12,572
Oh, Mum...

113
00:09:12,671 --> 00:09:15,400
I noticed these things
are back in fashion.

114
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,832
Grandmother's dress.

115
00:09:18,012 --> 00:09:22,129
Oh, honey.
He's a lovely man, Annie.

116
00:09:22,236 --> 00:09:24,964
I know he is wonderful,
isn't he?

117
00:09:25,937 --> 00:09:29,082
- And he's such a wonderful athlete.
- Are his folks nice?

118
00:09:29,146 --> 00:09:29,988
You'll love them.

119
00:09:30,013 --> 00:09:32,808
We're going down to DC tonight to
be with them Christmas morning.

120
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:36,404
- How did it happen?
- Well, it's silly, really.

121
00:09:37,006 --> 00:09:40,317
I mean, I'd seen him at the office.
Obviously I'd seen him.

122
00:09:40,342 --> 00:09:41,833
He's the associate publisher.

123
00:09:42,075 --> 00:09:45,955
And then one day, we both ordered
sandwiches from the same place...

124
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:50,506
and he got my lettuce and tomato on whole
wheat, which, of course, he was allergic to.

125
00:09:50,531 --> 00:09:52,711
And I got his lettuce
and tomato on white.

126
00:09:52,765 --> 00:09:55,045
- How amazing.
- It is, isn't it?

127
00:09:55,176 --> 00:09:57,410
You make a million decisions
that mean nothing

128
00:09:57,435 --> 00:10:00,200
and then one day you order
takeout that changes your life.

129
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:02,340
Destiny takes a hand.

130
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:05,450
Mum, destiny is something
we've invented

131
00:10:05,553 --> 00:10:08,942
because we can't stand the fact that
everything that happens is accidental.

132
00:10:09,027 --> 00:10:12,687
Then how do you explain that you both
ordered exactly the same sandwich...

133
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,118
except for the bread?

134
00:10:14,328 --> 00:10:16,187
How many people in this world...

135
00:10:16,212 --> 00:10:20,297
like lettuce and tomato without
something else, like tuna?

136
00:10:21,011 --> 00:10:25,141
Well, it wasn't a sign.
It was a coincidence.

137
00:10:25,711 --> 00:10:29,632
I was in Atlantic City with my
family, Cliff was a waiter.

138
00:10:29,777 --> 00:10:33,812
He wasn't even supposed to work that night.
Suppose he hadn't?

139
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:38,222
He asked me to take a midnight
walk on the Steel Pier.

140
00:10:38,488 --> 00:10:41,803
I probably told you this a
million times, but I don't care.

141
00:10:43,006 --> 00:10:45,108
Then he held my hand.

142
00:10:45,548 --> 00:10:50,640
At one point I looked down and I couldn't tell
which fingers were his and which were mine.

143
00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:55,016
- And I knew.
- What?

144
00:10:55,502 --> 00:10:56,836
You know.

145
00:10:57,718 --> 00:11:02,757
- What?
- Magic. It was magic.

146
00:11:03,876 --> 00:11:05,121
Magic.

147
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:09,699
I knew we'd be together forever. And
that everything would be wonderful.

148
00:11:09,797 --> 00:11:12,351
Just the way you feel about Walter.

149
00:11:12,545 --> 00:11:16,155
Walter. It's quite a formal name.
Isn't it?

150
00:11:17,823 --> 00:11:21,478
One of the things I truly knew
was that your father and I...

151
00:11:21,503 --> 00:11:23,995
were going to have a
wonderful time in...

152
00:11:24,047 --> 00:11:26,142
the sack, I believe you call it.

153
00:11:26,538 --> 00:11:27,425
Mum.

154
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:29,816
Of course it took several
years before everything...

155
00:11:29,841 --> 00:11:31,816
worked like clockwork
in that department.

156
00:11:31,923 --> 00:11:34,131
So don't be worried
if it takes a while.

157
00:11:34,219 --> 00:11:39,061
- We already...
- Fine, fine. Fiddly-dee. How's it working?

158
00:11:39,352 --> 00:11:43,898
- Like clockwork.
- Oh, honey...

159
00:11:46,756 --> 00:11:50,886
- It's a sign.
- You don't believe in signs.

160
00:11:56,543 --> 00:12:00,730
They loved you. I told you they
would love you, and they loved you.

161
00:12:00,842 --> 00:12:04,221
- I love you.
- I love you, Walter.

162
00:12:06,352 --> 00:12:08,555
Did anyone ever call you
anything other than Walter?

163
00:12:09,234 --> 00:12:10,031
No.

164
00:12:11,844 --> 00:12:16,323
- Not even when you were young?
- No, not even when I was young.

165
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:19,940
You sure you don't
want to drive with me?

166
00:12:20,003 --> 00:12:22,713
Oh, how will I get back
to Baltimore on Friday?

167
00:12:22,834 --> 00:12:27,329
I forgot the present. Walter, I left your
stepmother's present inside by accident.

168
00:12:27,354 --> 00:12:29,058
I swear, when we're old and grey...

169
00:12:29,151 --> 00:12:30,962
you gonna have to remind me
to put my teeth in.

170
00:12:31,074 --> 00:12:35,173
I'll be walking all over town smacking
my gums together, not even noticing.

171
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:38,355
- I'll wait.
- You'll wait? Oh, right.

172
00:12:38,586 --> 00:12:41,678
No, don't wait, Walter. Really, it's silly,
you go ahead. We're late anyway.

173
00:12:41,703 --> 00:12:43,280
I'll be ten minutes behind you.

<i>Welcome back to
"You and Your Emotions."</i>

186
00:13:17,122 --> 00:13:20,918
<i>I'm Dr. Marcia Fieldstone,
broadcasting live across America...</i>

187
00:13:20,976 --> 00:13:23,434
<i>from the top of the
Sears Tower in Chicago.</i>

188
00:13:23,546 --> 00:13:27,272
<i>Tonight we're talking
about wishes and dreams.</i>

189
00:13:27,365 --> 00:13:29,333
<i>What's your wish
this Christmas Eve?</i>

190
00:13:29,456 --> 00:13:34,166
<i>- What's your wish?</i>
- My wish is to turn the radio station.

191
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:38,018
<i>Subject of this evening's
"You and your spleen."</i>

192
00:13:38,043 --> 00:13:39,481
- <i>And your host is...</i>
- Not on your life.

193
00:13:39,538 --> 00:13:44,514
<i>Coming up, "Jingle Bells" backwards,
sung by the New Jersey coming up...</i>

194
00:13:44,772 --> 00:13:47,841
<i>- Seattle, go ahead.
- Hello, this is Jonah...</i>

195
00:13:48,469 --> 00:13:50,152
<i>No last names, Jonah.</i>

196
00:13:50,243 --> 00:13:53,311
<i>You sound younger than our usual callers.
How old are you?</i>

197
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,537
<i>I'm 8.</i>

198
00:13:54,613 --> 00:13:56,639
<i>Eight? How come you're up so late?</i>

199
00:13:56,771 --> 00:13:58,451
<i>It's not that late in Seattle.</i>

200
00:13:58,476 --> 00:14:00,393
<i>Oh, of course,
you're absolutely right.</i>

201
00:14:00,496 --> 00:14:02,607
<i>All right, what's your
Christmas wish, Jonah?</i>

202
00:14:02,739 --> 00:14:06,440
<i>It's not for me, it's for my dad.
I think he needs a new wife.</i>

203
00:14:06,807 --> 00:14:08,495
<i>FIELDSTONE;
You don't like the one he has now?</i>

204
00:14:08,584 --> 00:14:11,229
<i>He doesn't have one now.
That's the problem.</i>

205
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:12,611
<i>Where's your mum?</i>

206
00:14:12,677 --> 00:14:13,691
<i>She died.</i>

207
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:18,236
<i>- Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.</i>
- Well, who can believe this?

208
00:14:18,602 --> 00:14:21,704
<i>I've been pretty sad,
but I think my Dad's worse.</i>

209
00:14:21,814 --> 00:14:24,306
<i>FIELDSTONE;
Have you talked to your dad about this?</i>

210
00:14:24,473 --> 00:14:26,223
<i>- No.
- Why not?</i>

211
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,287
<i>It's like it makes him sadder.</i>

212
00:14:28,469 --> 00:14:32,101
<i>Aw, I can understand that.
Jonah, is your dad home right now?</i>

213
00:14:32,201 --> 00:14:34,695
<i>- Yeah.
- What's he doing? Is he busy?</i>

214
00:14:34,894 --> 00:14:36,679
<i>Not really, he's out on the deck.</i>

215
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:39,750
<i>I'm sure that I can help.
But I'm gonna need you to help me...</i>

216
00:14:40,987 --> 00:14:44,807
<i>Wretched woman! Hang up, Jonah!
Don't listen to her!</i>

217
00:14:44,832 --> 00:14:46,731
<i>No way, he'd kill me.</i>

218
00:14:46,893 --> 00:14:48,002
<i>Trust me, Jonah.</i>

219
00:14:48,027 --> 00:14:52,003
<i>He won't be angry when he realises
how concerned you are about him.</i>

220
00:14:52,112 --> 00:14:53,316
Wanna bet?

221
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:55,986
<i>But if I get yelled at, I'm never
gonna listen to your show again.</i>

222
00:14:56,011 --> 00:14:57,698
<i>Okay, fair enough.</i>

223
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:02,211
- Dad?
- Yeah.

224
00:15:02,575 --> 00:15:05,654
There's someone
on the phone for you.

225
00:15:08,428 --> 00:15:10,553
- His name is Sam.
<i>- Sam.</i>

226
00:15:10,693 --> 00:15:13,764
<i>If you've just tuned in,
this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone</i>

227
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:16,339
<i>and tonight's topic
is your wishes and dreams.</i>

228
00:15:16,671 --> 00:15:19,752
<i>We're on the line now with
someone from Seattle.</i>

229
00:15:19,862 --> 00:15:20,549
Hello.

230
00:15:20,635 --> 00:15:24,592
<i>Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone
on Network America.</i>

231
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:29,537
Okay. What are you selling tonight?
Micro-hibachis or knives?

232
00:15:29,623 --> 00:15:33,100
<i>No, I'm not selling anything.
I just wanna help.</i>

233
00:15:33,221 --> 00:15:35,264
<i>I want you to know
that your son called...</i>

234
00:15:35,354 --> 00:15:39,030
<i>and he asked me for some advice
on how you might find a new wife.</i>

235
00:15:39,151 --> 00:15:40,326
Who is this?

236
00:15:40,512 --> 00:15:46,401
<i>Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
And you are on the air.</i>

237
00:15:46,426 --> 00:15:50,526
<i>- You called a radio station?
- Sam, hello... Sam, are you with me?</i>

238
00:15:50,551 --> 00:15:52,034
Yeah. Yes.

239
00:15:52,432 --> 00:15:56,942
<i>Your son feels that since your wife's
death you've been very, very unhappy.</i>

240
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,181
<i>And he is genuinely
worried about you.</i>

241
00:16:00,275 --> 00:16:02,815
Alright, get out here.
Get out here.

242
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,080
Come on, now, I'm not gonna
go through this alone.

243
00:16:05,154 --> 00:16:09,323
<i>I think it's very hard for him
to talk to you about all this.</i>

244
00:16:09,475 --> 00:16:14,379
<i>I thought maybe you and I could talk, it would
make Jonah feel a little better. Sam?</i>

245
00:16:14,466 --> 00:16:18,115
- Talk to her, Dad. She's a doctor.
- Of what?

246
00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:20,044
Her first name could be Doctor.

247
00:16:20,302 --> 00:16:26,316
- Please.
<i>- Sam. Sam, it's his Christmas wish.</i>

248
00:16:27,015 --> 00:16:29,725
- Okay.
<i>- Okay. Good.</i>

249
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:34,861
<i>Now, I know this is difficult.
But how long ago did your wife die?</i>

250
00:16:36,433 --> 00:16:41,246
- About a year and a half ago.
<i>- Aw. Have you had any relationships since?</i>

251
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:46,783
- No.
<i>- No? Why not?</i>

252
00:16:48,477 --> 00:16:51,968
Uh, Marcia, or should I call you
Dr. Fieldstone?

253
00:16:52,036 --> 00:16:53,263
<i>Dr. Marcia.</i>

254
00:16:53,356 --> 00:16:56,691
- Dr. Marcia.
- Dr. Marcia, I don't mean to be rude...

255
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:59,535
<i>And I don't want to invade
your privacy...</i>

256
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,169
- Sure you do.
- Sure you do.

257
00:17:01,377 --> 00:17:05,989
<i>FIELDSTONE;
Go on, Sam. I'm listening. Sam.</i>

258
00:17:07,763 --> 00:17:11,958
We had a pretty tough time there at first.

259
00:17:12,361 --> 00:17:15,071
But... we're dealing with it.

260
00:17:15,593 --> 00:17:22,296
And Jonah and I will get along just fine
again, as soon as I break his radio.

261
00:17:24,769 --> 00:17:27,819
<i>I have no doubt that
you're a wonderful father.</i>

262
00:17:27,878 --> 00:17:30,473
<i>You know, you can tell a lot
from a person's voice.</i>

263
00:17:30,522 --> 00:17:31,652
You certainly can.

264
00:17:31,677 --> 00:17:36,204
<i>But something must be missing if Jonah
still feels that you're under a cloud.</i>

265
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:39,660
<i>Just a few questions:
Are you sleeping at night?</i>

266
00:17:39,965 --> 00:17:41,906
<i>He doesn't sleep at all.</i>

267
00:17:41,973 --> 00:17:44,723
- How do you know that?
- I live here, Dad.

268
00:17:48,258 --> 00:17:51,848
Look, it's Christmas.

269
00:17:55,714 --> 00:17:59,019
Maggie, my wife.

270
00:17:59,131 --> 00:18:01,847
She really did it...

271
00:18:01,942 --> 00:18:07,558
I mean, she loved...
She made everything beautiful.

272
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,470
<i>It's just tough this time of year.</i>

273
00:18:13,642 --> 00:18:15,121
Every kid needs a mother.

274
00:18:15,146 --> 00:18:19,825
<i>Could it be that you need someone
just as much as Jonah does?</i>

275
00:18:23,054 --> 00:18:25,340
- Yes.
<i>- Don't answer that.</i>

276
00:18:25,446 --> 00:18:27,483
<i>Let's get into that
right after these messages.</i>

277
00:18:27,508 --> 00:18:30,046
<i>Sam, Jonah, don't go away.</i>

278
00:18:30,071 --> 00:18:34,475
<i>If you've have just tuned in,
we are talking to Sleepless in Seattle.</i>

279
00:18:34,562 --> 00:18:38,872
<i>And we'll be right back after this
break with your listener response.</i>

280
00:18:39,167 --> 00:18:40,490
What is she talking about?

281
00:18:40,515 --> 00:18:43,615
This is when other people get to
call in and dump on what you said.

282
00:18:43,712 --> 00:18:49,502
Oh. Oh. Well, this is
really fun. And helpful.

283
00:18:55,197 --> 00:18:57,380
I bet he's tall
with a cute butt.

284
00:18:57,455 --> 00:18:59,810
I bet he hasn't bathed
in weeks and he stinks.

285
00:18:59,897 --> 00:19:03,977
- Harriet, shut up. Hi, can I help you?
- Tea, with the bag out.

286
00:19:04,081 --> 00:19:08,157
You know, maybe I'll just go up to Seattle,
give him a little gift for New Year's Eve.

287
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:12,100
Yeah, you go on out there if you want to.
But don't open his refrigerator.

288
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,290
They don't cover anything when
they put it in the fridge...

289
00:19:14,315 --> 00:19:17,563
they just stick it in there and leave
it till it walks out by itself.

290
00:19:17,787 --> 00:19:21,110
All I'm saying is I wouldn't kick this
guy out of my bed for eating crackers.

291
00:19:21,171 --> 00:19:23,040
<i>You know what I'm saying?
Sixty five cents.</i>

292
00:19:23,113 --> 00:19:25,534
Let's take a call
before we get back to Sleepless.

293
00:19:25,603 --> 00:19:29,549
<i>Ooh!
Tennessee, you are on the air. Talk to me.</i>

294
00:19:29,715 --> 00:19:34,596
<i>Yes, I would just like to know where
I could get this man's address.</i>

295
00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:36,448
Honey, get in line.

296
00:19:36,532 --> 00:19:38,549
<i>Next caller, go ahead.</i>

297
00:19:39,925 --> 00:19:43,473
<i>If there was one question
I was allowed to ask...</i>

298
00:19:43,611 --> 00:19:45,082
<i>Oh, go ahead.</i>

299
00:19:45,389 --> 00:19:49,519
<i>People who truly loved once
are far more likely to love again.</i>

300
00:19:49,582 --> 00:19:54,471
<i>Sam, do you think that there is someone out
there you could love as much as your wife?</i>

301
00:19:56,768 --> 00:20:01,277
Well, Dr. Marcia Fieldstone,
that's hard to imagine.

302
00:20:01,614 --> 00:20:03,910
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

303
00:20:04,354 --> 00:20:08,832
Well, I'm going to get
out of bed every morning

304
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:12,410
and breathe in
and out all day long.

305
00:20:12,635 --> 00:20:17,229
<i>And after a while I won't
have to remind myself</i>

306
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:21,220
<i>to get out of bed every morning
and breathe in and out.</i>

307
00:20:22,396 --> 00:20:25,846
And then after a while I won't
have to think about how...

308
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:30,256
I had it great and perfect for a while.

309
00:20:30,459 --> 00:20:34,217
<i>Sam, tell me what was
so special about your wife.</i>

310
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,389
<i>Well, how long is your programme?</i>

311
00:20:39,683 --> 00:20:45,439
<i>Oh, well, it was a million
tiny, little things.</i>

312
00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:50,447
<i>When you added them all up, it just
meant we were supposed to be together.</i>

313
00:20:50,512 --> 00:20:54,892
<i>And I knew it, I knew it
the very first time I touched her.</i>

314
00:20:55,327 --> 00:21:00,827
It was like coming home,
only to no home I'd ever known.

315
00:21:01,037 --> 00:21:03,569
I was just taking her hand...

316
00:21:04,086 --> 00:21:09,118
to help her out of a car.
And I knew it.

317
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:14,321
<i>- It was like magic.</i>
- Magic

318
00:21:15,893 --> 00:21:21,603
<i>Well, folks, it's time to wrap it up.
I'm Dr. Marcia Fieldstone in Chicago.</i>

319
00:21:21,774 --> 00:21:26,114
<i>And to all my listeners,
a magical and merry Christmas.</i>

320
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:29,293
<i>And to you, Sleepless in Seattle,</i>

321
00:21:29,394 --> 00:21:33,620
<i>we hope you'll call again soon
and let us know how it's going.</i>

322
00:21:33,703 --> 00:21:35,737
<i>Oh, you can count on it.</i>

<i>This man sells the greatest soup you've ever

329
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:33,539
<i>I feel very strongly about this, Becky.
It's not just about soup.</i>

330
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:34,765
Do it. What else?

331
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:37,110
New Year's Eve. Please
don't make me write it.

332
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:42,353
"Phone service in the Chicago area was
tied up for two hours Christmas Eve...

333
00:22:42,378 --> 00:22:46,322
when some kid calls a radio show and
says that his dad needs a new wife."

334
00:22:46,481 --> 00:22:49,924
Two thousand women called the station
asking for the guy's number.

335
00:22:49,985 --> 00:22:53,853
I heard it. This kid calls up and
says, "My dad needs a wife."

336
00:22:53,904 --> 00:22:57,931
And the shrink practically forces the guy
and says, "Do you want to talk about it."

337
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:00,054
And he says,
"No, as a matter of fact, I don't."

338
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,605
And then suddenly for no
reason at all he start to talk...

339
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:05,512
about how much he loved his wife and
how he just fell in love with her...

340
00:23:05,537 --> 00:23:07,372
like he was one of those
cows in Michigan.

341
00:23:07,997 --> 00:23:09,489
What cows in Michigan?

342
00:23:09,551 --> 00:23:12,879
It was on 60 Minutes over those cows
that got zapped by stray voltage.

343
00:23:12,904 --> 00:23:15,419
No one knows why.
And maybe it was Wisconsin.

344
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:20,160
But, anyway, I was listening to him
talk about how much he loved his wife...

345
00:23:20,186 --> 00:23:21,728
and suddenly I was crying.

346
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:24,680
It's like what happens when I
watch those phone company ads.

347
00:23:24,747 --> 00:23:26,384
I don't have to see the whole
thing, just the part...

348
00:23:26,426 --> 00:23:29,840
where the daughter gives the mother the
refrigerator with the big red bow.

349
00:23:29,911 --> 00:23:34,051
Yes. The Polaroid commercial, two 5-year-olds
at their grandfather's birthday party.

350
00:23:34,076 --> 00:23:38,178
They're making the album.
That kills me!

351
00:23:39,847 --> 00:23:41,428
You should write something about this.

352
00:23:41,639 --> 00:23:43,835
- About what?
- Whatever it is.

353
00:23:43,952 --> 00:23:47,708
I tell you what it is. Two thousand women
calling a radio station for a husband?

354
00:23:47,864 --> 00:23:49,874
There are a lot of desperate women
out there looking for love.

355
00:23:49,899 --> 00:23:51,673
Especially over a certain age.

356
00:23:51,781 --> 00:23:55,282
You know it's easier to be killed by a
terrorist than it is to get married over 40.

357
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:57,142
That is not true.
That statistic is not true.

358
00:23:57,167 --> 00:23:59,899
That's right, it's not true.
But it feels true.

359
00:23:59,924 --> 00:24:01,415
It feels true because it's true.

360
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,980
There is practically a whole book
about how that statistic is not true.

361
00:24:04,275 --> 00:24:07,025
- Calm down, you brought it up.
- I did not, Wyatt.

362
00:24:07,171 --> 00:24:08,291
Did you even read that book?

363
00:24:08,316 --> 00:24:10,313
Did anybody read that book
all the way through?

364
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:13,625
Are you two finished?
Fine, now where were we?

365
00:24:14,231 --> 00:24:17,725
If someone's a widower, why do
they say that he was he "widowed"?

366
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:20,250
Why don't they say
he was "widowered"?

367
00:24:22,398 --> 00:24:24,287
I was just wondering.

368
00:24:25,389 --> 00:24:27,310
What was that about up there?

369
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:30,040
What was what?
What's with you?

370
00:24:30,292 --> 00:24:32,372
Nothing's with me.

371
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:34,059
Something's with you.

372
00:24:34,297 --> 00:24:37,927
What are you saying?
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

373
00:24:38,173 --> 00:24:39,513
Sleepless in Seattle?

374
00:24:39,674 --> 00:24:42,254
That's what she called him on the
show because he can't sleep.

375
00:24:42,468 --> 00:24:46,718
And now 2000 women want his number.
The guy could be a crackhead,

376
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:51,060
a transvestite, a flasher, a junkie,
a chainsaw murderer

377
00:24:51,226 --> 00:24:54,476
or someone really sick,
someone like my Rick.

378
00:24:56,148 --> 00:24:58,398
Actually, he sounded nice.

379
00:24:58,567 --> 00:25:02,027
Oh? Oh, really?

380
00:25:02,196 --> 00:25:04,616
Now we're getting down to it.

381
00:25:04,782 --> 00:25:09,252
Please, Becky. I'm madly in love with Walter.
He did the craziest thing the other night.

382
00:25:09,277 --> 00:25:10,657
What was that?

383
00:25:12,362 --> 00:25:16,864
- Oh, it was so funny. We were hysterical.
- What was that?

384
00:25:28,513 --> 00:25:33,513
You know, I was thinking, I've gotta go
to Boston for the AAB convention, right?

385
00:25:33,685 --> 00:25:38,065
And then I gotta visit Winston-Hughes about
switching over our computers, but...

386
00:25:38,231 --> 00:25:42,491
Why don't we meet in New York
for Valentine's Day weekend.

387
00:25:42,652 --> 00:25:44,941
Walter, I'd love to!

388
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:48,409
We can stay at the Plaza.

389
00:25:48,573 --> 00:25:50,783
Ice skate in Central Park.

390
00:25:50,951 --> 00:25:53,111
Register.

391
00:25:53,286 --> 00:25:54,996
Register.

392
00:25:55,163 --> 00:25:59,453
Yeah, for dishes,
glasses, silver, everything.

393
00:26:02,796 --> 00:26:04,676
How about it?

394
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:09,810
I'll take you to Chinatown
for dim sum.

395
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:11,350
Does it have wheat in it?

396
00:26:11,513 --> 00:26:13,632

430
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:28,756
You used to say,
"Here's to us."

431
00:29:32,951 --> 00:29:34,668
Oh, babe.

432
00:29:34,742 --> 00:29:36,967
I miss you so much it hurts.

433
00:29:55,228 --> 00:29:57,148
What do you wanna do?
Tell him when he gets here.

434
00:29:57,272 --> 00:29:59,862
You want to tell him?
You can tell him?

435
00:30:00,025 --> 00:30:01,605
She's back.
She has another idea.

436
00:30:01,777 --> 00:30:02,947
No, no, no.
I don't need this.

437
00:30:03,111 --> 00:30:05,121
Sam, I'm so glad you're here.
How are you?

438
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:08,830
I heard you on the radio.
I told everyone about it.

439
00:30:09,117 --> 00:30:10,867
We already knew.
How did you...?

440
00:30:11,036 --> 00:30:12,496
Grace.
The dispatcher?

441
00:30:12,663 --> 00:30:13,993
Yeah.
All of Seattle knows.

442
00:30:14,164 --> 00:30:16,743
I was brushing my teeth
and, suddenly, there you were.

443
00:30:16,916 --> 00:30:19,706
I just couldn't believe my ears.
I called my mother in Las Vegas.

444
00:30:19,877 --> 00:30:24,637
I said, "Mother, turn on the radio.
That's my architect."

445
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:30,889
You know, it's so nice when a
man can express his feelings.

446
00:30:31,055 --> 00:30:33,435
It's wonderful.
I wish I could express my feelings.

447
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:35,479
So, Claire, is there a problem?

448
00:30:35,643 --> 00:30:39,523
I was tossing and turning last night.
You know what that's like, Sam.

449
00:30:39,689 --> 00:30:42,699
Because I realise I'm never
going to fit my platters

450
00:30:42,858 --> 00:30:44,658
in that refrigerator we ordered.

451
00:30:44,819 --> 00:30:46,779
And when I give parties,
I always put in platters.

452
00:30:46,861 --> 00:30:49,531
So I thought I would get the
sub-zero refrigerator instead.

453
00:30:49,698 --> 00:30:52,708
And the only problem...
We have to redo all the cabinets.

454
00:30:52,909 --> 00:30:55,579
We're gonna...
We'll be into this wall.

455
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:58,417
- That's bearing wall.
- That's a delay, Claire, of...

456
00:30:58,581 --> 00:31:00,701
Two, three...
Five, six...

457
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:02,375
Twelve weeks.
I don't mind.

458
00:31:02,544 --> 00:31:04,874
The important thing
is to get it right.

459
00:31:05,046 --> 00:31:06,756
Absolutely.
Your words.

460
00:31:06,923 --> 00:31:09,673
Oh, I've gotta rush.
La décorateur calls.

461
00:31:09,843 --> 00:31:12,263
- Bye.
- Bye.

462
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:19,149
Well, this is fate. She's divorced,
we don't wanna redo the cabinets,

463
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:23,230
and you need a wife. What do they call
that, when everything intersects?

464
00:31:23,397 --> 00:31:25,147
The Bermuda Triangle.

465
00:31:34,742 --> 00:31:38,532
And here's another one. Do you
got room for one more here?

466
00:31:38,704 --> 00:31:40,414
Here you go. Right there.

467
00:31:40,581 --> 00:31:42,371
Look at this, Dad.
They're all for you.

468
00:31:42,541 --> 00:31:44,041
Yes, sir. Here you go.

469
00:31:47,795 --> 00:31:50,255
"Sleepless in Seattle,"
c/o Dr. Marcia Fieldstone.

470
00:31:50,423 --> 00:31:52,553
If you're having trouble sleeping,
you might wanna try...

471
00:31:52,623 --> 00:31:55,092
drinking a glass of water
from the other side.

472
00:31:55,177 --> 00:31:57,795
- I thought that was for hiccups.
- Does it work for hiccups?

473
00:31:57,856 --> 00:32:01,441
For hiccups, take a spoonful of sugar,
hold it in your mouth for a minute.

474
00:32:01,525 --> 00:32:02,606
Really?

475
00:32:03,225 --> 00:32:04,598
Thank you.

476
00:32:05,586 --> 00:32:07,895
What possessed you
to give them our address?

477
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,084
They called and asked for it.

478
00:32:11,561 --> 00:32:13,238
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle,

479
00:32:13,263 --> 00:32:17,045
you're the most attractive man
I ever lay ears on." Pfft.

480
00:32:17,137 --> 00:32:19,386
Wait, wait, wait...
They called?

481
00:32:19,601 --> 00:32:22,973
How did they get our number?
Oh, let me guess. You gave it to them.

482
00:32:23,045 --> 00:32:26,082
You have to give them your number
or they won't let you on the air.

483
00:32:26,168 --> 00:32:30,379
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle. I live in Tulsa."
Where's that?

484
00:32:30,918 --> 00:32:32,588
It's in Oklahoma.

485
00:32:32,737 --> 00:32:35,823
- You know where Oklahoma is?
- Somewhere in the middle.

486
00:32:35,917 --> 00:32:38,637
I'm not even gonna think about what
they're not teaching you in school,

487
00:32:38,671 --> 00:32:40,081
I'm not gonna to think about...

488
00:32:40,106 --> 00:32:42,282
Yeah, somewhere in the middle.
And, generally speaking

489
00:32:42,307 --> 00:32:46,737
we should rule out anyone
that doesn't live near here.

490
00:32:46,937 --> 00:32:48,606
She's willing to fly anywhere.

491
00:32:50,814 --> 00:32:54,652
Well, she looks like my third-grade teacher.
I hated my third-grade teacher.

492
00:32:54,677 --> 00:32:57,107
Wait a minute.
She is my third-grade teacher!

493
00:32:58,145 --> 00:33:02,204
- Aren't you gonna read any of these?
- No. This is not how it's done.

494
00:33:02,609 --> 00:33:06,813
I'd much rather just...
see somebody I like

495
00:33:07,012 --> 00:33:11,432
and get a feeling about them,
ask them if they wanna have a drink.

496
00:33:11,616 --> 00:33:13,808
- Or a slice of pizza?
- Not dinner.

497
00:33:13,842 --> 00:33:18,272
Not on the first date, because halfway
through dinner, you could be really sorry.

498
00:33:18,383 --> 00:33:20,223
Whereas, if it's just a drink

499
00:33:20,385 --> 00:33:23,008
if you like them, you can
always ask them to dinner.

500
00:33:23,033 --> 00:33:26,913
If not, you can say, "Well, that
was great," and then you go home.

501
00:33:27,021 --> 00:33:28,617
You see what I mean?

502
00:33:30,979 --> 00:33:32,769
I wonder if it
still works this way.

503
00:33:32,981 --> 00:33:37,039
- It doesn't. They ask you.
- I'm starting to notice that.

504
00:33:37,305 --> 00:33:41,492
If you get a new wife, I guess
you'll have sex with her, huh?

505
00:33:41,601 --> 00:33:43,614
I certainly hope so.

506
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:46,086
Will she scratch up your back?

507
00:33:46,517 --> 00:33:47,695
What?

508
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:53,340
In movies, women always scratch
up the man's back and screaming.

509
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:56,453
- How do you know this?
- Jed's got cable.

510
00:33:56,755 --> 00:33:58,505
Oh, Jed's got...

511
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,339
Hand me that towel behind you.

512
00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:09,821
- Thank you.
- I need it too.

513
00:34:09,846 --> 00:34:11,134
Here, let me get you.

514
00:34:12,023 --> 00:34:13,759
"Jed's got cable!"

00:36:04,765 --> 00:36:09,305
<i>Well, I'm going to get out

00:36:10,365 --> 00:36:13,438

<i>Sam, tell me what was
so special about your wife?</i>

544
00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:42,249
<i>Well, how long is your programme?</i>

545
00:36:43,832 --> 00:36:47,253
<i>Oh, well, it was...</i>

546
00:36:47,523 --> 00:36:49,730
<i>Oh, it was a million tiny,
little things.</i>

547
00:36:49,809 --> 00:36:51,848
<i>When you added them all up</i>

548
00:36:51,995 --> 00:36:54,511
<i>it just meant that we were
supposed to be together.</i>

549
00:36:54,584 --> 00:36:55,894
<i>And I knew it.</i>

550
00:36:56,181 --> 00:36:58,910
<i>I knew it the first time I touched her.</i>

551
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,488
<i>It was like coming home,</i>

552
00:37:01,958 --> 00:37:04,828
<i>only to no home I'd ever known.</i>

553
00:37:05,144 --> 00:37:07,734
<i>I was just taking her hand,</i>

554
00:37:08,227 --> 00:37:10,325
<i>to help her out of a car.</i>

555
00:37:11,903 --> 00:37:13,943
<i>And I knew it.</i>

556
00:37:14,304 --> 00:37:15,903
<i>It was like...</i>

557
00:37:16,848 --> 00:37:18,348
<i>magic.</i>

558
00:37:40,637 --> 00:37:44,397
Well, I think I'm going crazy, Dennis.
I really do. Are you happily married?

559
00:37:44,487 --> 00:37:46,367
- What?
- I mean...

560
00:37:46,502 --> 00:37:50,101
Why did you get married?
Was it trumpets and fireworks?

561
00:37:50,313 --> 00:37:55,112
I got married because Betsy said we had to
break up or get married. So we got married.

562
00:37:55,751 --> 00:37:58,134
But when you first met her,
did you believe...

563
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:02,635
that she was the only person for you,
that in some mystical, cosmic way...

564
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,969
- it was fated?
- Annie,

565
00:38:05,612 --> 00:38:09,098
when you're attracted to someone,
it just means your subconscious...

566
00:38:09,123 --> 00:38:12,083
is attracted to their subconscious,
subconsciously.

567
00:38:12,251 --> 00:38:16,091
What we think of as fate is just two
neuroses knowing they're a perfect match.

568
00:38:17,696 --> 00:38:19,239
I don't even know him.

569
00:38:19,325 --> 00:38:24,107
I'm having all of these fantasies
about some man I've never even met,

570
00:38:24,225 --> 00:38:26,315
who lives in Seattle!

571
00:38:26,403 --> 00:38:28,528
It rains nine months
of the year in Seattle.

572
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,513
I know, I know.

573
00:38:30,538 --> 00:38:32,823
I do not wanna move to Seattle.

574
00:38:36,441 --> 00:38:38,121
But what I really don't wanna to do...

575
00:38:38,192 --> 00:38:41,254
is end up always wondering
what might've happened...

576
00:38:41,279 --> 00:38:44,409
and knowing I could've done
something. What do you think?

577
00:38:45,514 --> 00:38:47,441
It's just cold feet, isn't it?

578
00:38:47,466 --> 00:38:50,747
Everybody panics before they
get married, didn't you?

579
00:38:51,231 --> 00:38:52,613
Yes, I did.

580
00:38:52,706 --> 00:38:54,629
Yes, you did. Thank you
very much, Dennis.

581
00:38:54,654 --> 00:38:57,231
I feel so much better
just having blown this off.

582
00:38:57,306 --> 00:38:58,590
Anytime.

583
00:38:58,871 --> 00:39:02,059
Sandy has a girlfriend,
Glenda. She's a weightlifter.

584
00:39:02,145 --> 00:39:06,488
- Her neck isn't bigger than her head...
- No, I'm not asking you to set me up.

585
00:39:06,513 --> 00:39:11,512
I don't need your help with that.
I just wanna know what it's like out there.

586
00:39:11,537 --> 00:39:12,725
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

587
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,974
What women are looking for:
Pecs and a cute butt.

588
00:39:16,647 --> 00:39:19,357
- Like, "He has the cutest butt."
- Yeah.

589
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:22,279
- Where did I hear that recently?
- Everywhere.

590
00:39:22,381 --> 00:39:25,982
You can't even turn on the news
without hearing some babe...

591
00:39:26,007 --> 00:39:27,935
thought some guy's butt was cute.

592
00:39:28,044 --> 00:39:31,344
- Who the first woman to say this was?
- I don't know, but somehow it caught on.

593
00:39:31,592 --> 00:39:33,302
So how's my butt?

594
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:38,167
- Not bad.
- Really?

595
00:39:38,192 --> 00:39:39,824
- Yeah.
- Is it cute though?

596
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:42,579
- I don't know.
- Are we grading on a curve?

597
00:39:43,636 --> 00:39:45,621
When was the last time
you were out there?

598
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:49,344
Uh... Uh, uh...

599
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,472
Jimmy Carter, 1978.

600
00:39:53,232 --> 00:39:55,572
Things are a little different now.

601
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:59,107
First, you have to be friends.
You have to like each other.

602
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:02,966
Then you neck.
This could go on for years.

603
00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:06,006
Then you have tests, then you
get to do it with a condom.

604
00:40:06,235 --> 00:40:08,836
The good news is you split
the cheque with you.

605
00:40:08,969 --> 00:40:11,450
I don't think I could let
a woman pay for dinner.

606
00:40:11,616 --> 00:40:14,196
Great! They'll throw a parade
in your honour.

607
00:40:14,269 --> 00:40:16,894
You'll be Man of the Year
in Seattle Magazine.

608
00:40:18,596 --> 00:40:20,226
Tiramisu.

609
00:40:20,476 --> 00:40:23,335
- What is tiramisu?
- You'll find out.

610
00:40:23,514 --> 00:40:25,358
- Well, what is it?
- You'll see.

611
00:40:25,441 --> 00:40:28,437
Some woman is gonna want me to do it to her,
and I'm not gonna know what I am doing.

612
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:29,890
You'll love it.

613
00:40:30,717 --> 00:40:32,637
Oh, this is gonna be tough.

614
00:40:32,803 --> 00:40:35,633
Tough, tough. It's gonna be
much tougher than I thought.

615
00:40:35,847 --> 00:40:39,057
What about that decorator
on the Bennett job?

616
00:40:39,226 --> 00:40:41,646
- Victoria?
- Yeah. She's perky.

617
00:40:42,521 --> 00:40:44,473
- Oh, no, I don't...
- What?

618
00:40:44,498 --> 00:40:47,060
I'm far away from that.
What? No.

619
00:40:47,169 --> 00:40:49,222
- I'm just assembling notes. I'm not...
- Notes.

620
00:40:49,247 --> 00:40:51,427
- How would I do that?
- What do you mean? Call her up.

621
00:40:51,452 --> 00:40:53,606
You say, "Come, let's get together.
We'll look at swatches."

622
00:40:53,631 --> 00:40:56,649
Call her on the phone to say,
"Let's look at swatches"?

623
00:40:56,674 --> 00:40:59,304
Yeah, you know, colour schemes.
She's not gonna see through that?

624
00:40:59,329 --> 00:41:02,765
No, you don't do it like I do it.
You do it in your own suave way.

625
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:04,673
Think Cary Grant.

626
00:41:05,098 --> 00:41:08,808
Cary Grant would call up and say,
"Come over and look at my swatches"?

627
00:41:08,863 --> 00:41:12,692
How do you know? Maybe he did.
He didn't do it in the movies.

628
00:41:12,778 --> 00:41:14,569
Gunga Din? He didn't call...?

629
00:41:14,594 --> 00:41:17,117
Gunga Din is not a
swatch kind of movie.

630
00:41:17,177 --> 00:41:21,242
Who knows what he did in real life.
He did that with Dyan Cannon?

631
00:41:21,325 --> 00:41:22,352
Ooh yeah, sure.

632
00:41:22,377 --> 00:41:25,046
"Hello, Dyan!
Take a look at these swatches."

633
00:41:43,705 --> 00:41:46,295
Jonah, I'm home!

634
00:41:49,002 --> 00:41:51,502
Hey, Jonah!

635
00:41:57,801 --> 00:41:59,761
Jonah?

636
00:42:01,972 --> 00:42:03,602
Hey, Jonah.

637
00:42:05,392 --> 00:42:07,392
Hey, Jonah.

638
00:42:09,647 --> 00:42:11,107
Hi, Dad. This is Jessica.

639
00:42:13,567 --> 00:42:16,077
Well, it's nice to meet you, Jessica.

640
00:42:16,236 --> 00:42:17,576
Dad, this is amazing.

641
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:20,400
If you play this backwards,
it says "Paul is dead."

642
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,820
Yeah, yeah. I know.

643
00:42:24,328 --> 00:42:25,667
How do you know?

644
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:30,459
Dad, could you shut the door?

645
00:42:30,625 --> 00:42:32,795
Sure. Sure.

646
00:42:33,461 --> 00:42:35,291
H and G.

647
00:42:36,255 --> 00:42:38,675

657
00:43:54,447 --> 00:43:58,526
This is Sam Baldwin. I don't
know if you remember me, but...

658
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,710
Oh, great.

659
00:44:01,953 --> 00:44:03,743
Hi. Uh...

660
00:44:04,166 --> 00:44:07,039
I was wondering if, uh...

661
00:44:07,322 --> 00:44:10,133
If you would like to have
a drink with me?

662
00:44:11,118 --> 00:44:12,266
Dinner?

663
00:44:14,052 --> 00:44:16,209
Dinner would be even better.

664
00:44:17,951 --> 00:44:20,326
Friday would be great, yeah.

665
00:44:20,494 --> 00:44:23,274
How...? I hear that's a good place.

666
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:28,321
7:30 would be fine.

667
00:44:28,346 --> 00:44:30,846
And I'll, uh...

668
00:44:32,664 --> 00:44:35,834
Okay, I'll meet you there.
Okay. All right.

669
00:44:35,994 --> 00:44:41,818
Um... So it's Friday
at 7:30 for dinner.

670
00:44:41,895 --> 00:44:43,005
Great.

671
00:44:45,036 --> 00:44:46,826
Me too. Bye.

<i>I'm not now.</i>

675
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:05,360
Now those were the days when
people knew how to be in love.

676
00:45:05,525 --> 00:45:07,485
- You're a basket case.
- They knew it.

677
00:45:07,652 --> 00:45:11,662
Time, distance, nothing could
separate them because they knew.

678
00:45:11,759 --> 00:45:15,899
- It was right. It was real. It was...
- It's a movie.

679
00:45:16,001 --> 00:45:18,040
That's your problem.
You don't wanna be in love.

680
00:45:18,065 --> 00:45:20,063
You wanna be in love in a movie.

681
00:45:20,151 --> 00:45:21,766
Read it to me.

682
00:45:23,594 --> 00:45:28,077
"Dear Sleepless and Son. I've never written
a letter like this in my life..."

683
00:45:28,102 --> 00:45:31,383
That's what everyone writes at the
beginning of letters to strangers.

684
00:45:31,464 --> 00:45:33,962
I know that. You think
I don't know that?

685
00:45:34,967 --> 00:45:38,557
- What about Walter?
- Oh, Walter.

686
00:45:38,716 --> 00:45:41,556
Oh, I'd give anything
to marry Walter.

687
00:45:41,742 --> 00:45:44,185
He's so unexpected.

688
00:45:44,255 --> 00:45:48,177
You think you can tell what he's like
by just looking at him, but you can't.

689
00:45:48,755 --> 00:45:51,485
I should write something
in this about magic.

690
00:45:51,652 --> 00:45:54,264
- What?
- Something! What if I never meet him?

691
00:45:54,289 --> 00:45:56,982
What if this man is my destiny,
and I never meet him?

692
00:45:57,068 --> 00:46:00,239
Your destiny can be your doom.
Look at me and Rick.

693
00:46:00,264 --> 00:46:01,982
"I want to meet you"...

694
00:46:02,007 --> 00:46:03,357
<i>Top of the Empire State Building.</i>

695
00:46:03,382 --> 00:46:05,576
On the top of the
Empire State Building.

696
00:46:07,126 --> 00:46:09,217
Sunset, Valentine's Day.

697
00:46:10,978 --> 00:46:14,188
I'll be in New York with Walter.
I can squeeze it in.

698
00:46:15,266 --> 00:46:17,662
I'll be in New York with Walter!

699
00:46:25,326 --> 00:46:27,286
Do you wanna hear about destiny?

700
00:46:27,363 --> 00:46:28,732
If I hadn't married Martin

701
00:46:28,905 --> 00:46:30,995
I never would've bought the
house with the dead tree.

702
00:46:31,157 --> 00:46:33,117
On account of which
I got divorced.

703
00:46:33,284 --> 00:46:37,374
On account of which I hit a car and
met Rick while buying a neck brace.

704
00:46:37,539 --> 00:46:41,799
Wait a minute. You never told me you
got a divorce because of a dead tree?

705
00:46:42,711 --> 00:46:46,296
- The tree man.
- You fell in love with the tree man?

706
00:46:46,398 --> 00:46:49,176
I did not say "love."
Did I say "love"?

707
00:46:49,592 --> 00:46:51,913
This is my favourite part.

708
00:46:53,555 --> 00:46:55,805
<i>It's now or never.</i>

709
00:46:56,516 --> 00:46:58,975
<i>Never is a frightening word.</i>

710
00:46:59,977 --> 00:47:02,647
<i>We'd be fools to let
happiness pass us by.</i>

711
00:47:02,813 --> 00:47:04,233
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

712
00:47:05,941 --> 00:47:10,231
<i>Winter must be cold for those
with no warm memories.</i>

713
00:47:12,322 --> 00:47:16,112
<i>- We've already missed the spring.
- Yes.</i>

714
00:47:17,494 --> 00:47:19,494
Men never get this movie.

715
00:47:19,663 --> 00:47:21,453
I know.

716
00:47:23,417 --> 00:47:26,377
Mummy! Mummy!

717
00:47:28,572 --> 00:47:30,545
- Mummy!
- It's okay.

718
00:47:30,585 --> 00:47:31,470
- I'm coming.

719
00:47:31,495 --> 00:47:33,069
- Dad!
- I'm here.

720
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:36,310
It's all right. It's okay.

721
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:39,341
Hey, it's all right.
It's okay.

722
00:47:40,044 --> 00:47:42,763
- What was that about, huh?
- It was sinking.

723
00:47:42,857 --> 00:47:44,340
- What was?
- Our house.

724
00:47:44,365 --> 00:47:46,459
There was water coming in
all the windows.

725
00:47:46,484 --> 00:47:47,834
Oh.

726
00:47:48,831 --> 00:47:51,121
Well, it's okay now.

727
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:55,889
So, what should we do?

728
00:47:55,990 --> 00:48:01,086
Your mother used to sing to
you when you had bad dreams.

729
00:48:01,787 --> 00:48:03,617
"Bye Bye Blackbird."

730
00:48:05,207 --> 00:48:06,577
Yeah.

731
00:48:06,792 --> 00:48:08,462
I miss her.

732
00:48:09,294 --> 00:48:12,254
What do you think happens
to someone after they die?

733
00:48:13,548 --> 00:48:17,338
- I don't know.
- Like, do you believe in heaven?

734
00:48:20,889 --> 00:48:22,639
I never did.

735
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:27,730
Or the whole idea of an afterlife.
But now, I don't know.

736
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:30,647
Because I have these dreams...

737
00:48:32,233 --> 00:48:34,363
about your mum.

738
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:38,450
Yeah. And we have long talks.

739
00:48:40,115 --> 00:48:42,995
About you.
How you're doing.

740
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:47,499
Which she sort of knows,
but I tell her anyway.

741
00:48:47,706 --> 00:48:49,706
So, what is that?

742
00:48:51,836 --> 00:48:54,166
It's sort of an afterlife,
isn't it?

743
00:48:55,131 --> 00:48:56,921
I'm starting to forget her.

744
00:49:13,189 --> 00:49:16,859
She could peel an apple...

745
00:49:18,027 --> 00:49:21,657
in one long, curly strip.

746
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:25,870

other night, some guy from Seattle.

00:53:20,136 --> 00:53:22,016
- Psst.
- Okay, Clarise.

780
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:26,890
I'm gonna be back either by midnight
or 8:30, if disaster strikes.

781
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:31,900
Here's one for the both of us.
"Sleepless and Son, Baltimore."

782
00:53:32,065 --> 00:53:35,444
If there's any problem, here's
the number to the paediatrician.

783
00:53:35,554 --> 00:53:39,648
Here's a bottle of Ipecac if anybody drinks
poison. It's right next to the juice glasses.

784
00:53:39,773 --> 00:53:41,804
- Fine.
- How do I look?

785
00:53:41,912 --> 00:53:45,341
- Great.
- Do I look okay? I look all right?

786
00:53:45,683 --> 00:53:48,845
I look stupid. I look stupid.
I look like I'm trying too hard.

787
00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:51,495
I was gonna get a haircut, but I'd
just look like I got a haircut.

788
00:53:51,581 --> 00:53:54,214
- This is a good letter, Dad.
- The heels on these are grotesque.

789
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:58,185
- I look like I'm trying to be tall.
- Her name is Annie Reed.

790
00:53:58,210 --> 00:54:00,022
- Dad, read this.
- Now I'm late. Bye.

791
00:54:00,115 --> 00:54:02,037
Dad, Read this!

792
00:54:04,947 --> 00:54:06,657
"Sleepless and Son...

793
00:54:08,558 --> 00:54:13,665
I've been an excellent third baseman, and
while we're on it, let's just say right now:

794
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:16,250
Brooks Robinson was the
best third-base men ever.

795
00:54:16,357 --> 00:54:19,304
It's important you agree with me on
that because I'm from Baltimore."

796
00:54:19,329 --> 00:54:21,555
She thinks Brooks Robinson
is the greatest. So do you.

797
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:24,392
- Everyone thinks so.
- It's a sign.

798
00:54:24,741 --> 00:54:26,017
Come here.

799
00:54:27,048 --> 00:54:29,657
I'll show you a sign.
Here's a sign.

800
00:54:29,747 --> 00:54:31,417
All right.

801
00:54:31,664 --> 00:54:33,084

802
00:54:33,214 --> 00:54:35,628
Right. Where is Baltimore?

803
00:54:36,144 --> 00:54:38,042
Ah! It's right there! Look!

804
00:54:38,138 --> 00:54:43,161
One, two, three. There's like, 26 states
between here and there. Now, that's a sign.

805
00:54:43,255 --> 00:54:47,380
I'm out of here. Goodbye!
Good night! I love you.

806
00:54:51,433 --> 00:54:53,313
Clarise, did you move your car?

807
00:54:53,686 --> 00:54:54,686
Huh?

808
00:55:03,612 --> 00:55:06,241
- Thank you, Derrick.
- You're welcome.

809
00:55:06,412 --> 00:55:08,423

- White wine spritzer?

810
00:55:08,713 --> 00:55:09,392
And you, sir?

811
00:55:09,417 --> 00:55:11,026
I'm fine. Thank you.

812
00:55:11,136 --> 00:55:12,112
- Hi.
- Hi.

813
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:15,410
- You look good.
- You look good yourself.

814
00:55:20,731 --> 00:55:22,755
I thought you'd never call me.

815
00:55:23,214 --> 00:55:25,112
- Did you?
- I really wanted you to.

816
00:55:25,137 --> 00:55:27,026
And I thought you were
never going to.

817
00:55:27,091 --> 00:55:28,975
- Excuse me, Mr. Baldwin?
- Yes.

818
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,676
There's a phone call for you.

819
00:55:31,677 --> 00:55:33,489
Excuse me.

820
00:55:38,186 --> 00:55:40,021

00:55:56,621 --> 00:55:58,711
Is Clarise there?
Has she been strangled?

827
00:55:58,802 --> 00:56:01,754
<i>- No.</i>
- This is the only reason for this call?

828
00:56:01,779 --> 00:56:04,661
<i>If we book now,
we can get an excursion fare.</i>

829
00:56:04,747 --> 00:56:09,343
<i>- Jessica's parents are travel agents...</i>
- I'm not having this conversation right now.

830
00:56:09,715 --> 00:56:11,675
We'll talk about it
at a later time.

831
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:15,080
I can't believe this conversation has
lasted this long. You go to bed.

832
00:56:22,932 --> 00:56:25,102
- Everything all right?
- Oh, yeah.

833
00:56:25,213 --> 00:56:26,939
- Do you have kids?
- No.

834
00:56:27,067 --> 00:56:28,064
Do you want mine?

835
00:56:31,321 --> 00:56:33,892
I'll have an Absolut
straight up, please.

836
00:56:52,383 --> 00:56:55,553
Hey, hey! Put that down.
Stop it!

837
00:56:55,928 --> 00:56:57,518
There she is.

838
00:56:58,689 --> 00:57:00,273
Why is she bringing
those groceries?

839
00:57:00,298 --> 00:57:02,712
She's gonna cook us something,
so be prepared.

840
00:57:02,737 --> 00:57:05,064
Hi, Sam. Thanks!

841
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:08,518
And let me guess.
You must be Jonah.

842
00:57:10,442 --> 00:57:11,417
Hi.

843
00:57:12,576 --> 00:57:14,089
- So this it?
- Yeah.

844
00:57:14,191 --> 00:57:16,545
- The car's down this way.
- Great.

845
00:57:17,761 --> 00:57:21,681
She's on her sixth painter and we
are never going to finish this job.

846
00:57:21,777 --> 00:57:24,324
Now she wants
the fireplace rebricked.

847
00:57:24,386 --> 00:57:26,484
I know what she wants.
I could give her a call.

848
00:57:26,509 --> 00:57:30,492
No, I've got it solved. I'll just hit
her with one of those fireplace bricks.

849
00:57:32,937 --> 00:57:37,069
That's so funny.
You're so funny.

850
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:39,279
When she wants something
done she says,

851
00:57:39,304 --> 00:57:43,202
 "Oh, I don't know. I'm stupid.
You know what's best.

852
00:57:43,315 --> 00:57:48,565
But couldn't we flip the house around so
that everything in the back is now in front?

853
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:53,988
And could the whole front of the house open on
a hinge so I can get in with a garage opener."

854
00:57:54,599 --> 00:58:00,224
- "Well, yeah yeah. We can, we'll do that,"
- "Just move the kitchen cabinets."

855
00:58:08,039 --> 00:58:10,140
Hey, Jonah, bring some of
that stuff around, all right?

856
00:58:10,833 --> 00:58:13,312
Victoria, do you like baseball?

857
00:58:15,005 --> 00:58:16,412
Yes, I do.

858
00:58:16,484 --> 00:58:20,381
In fact my firm has box seats to the Mariners.
Why don't we all go some time.

859
00:58:20,406 --> 00:58:21,247
Hey!

860
00:58:21,757 --> 00:58:24,546
- What about camping?
- What about it?

861
00:58:24,663 --> 00:58:26,546
Do you like camping?

862
00:58:26,659 --> 00:58:28,460
I went camping once.

863
00:58:29,456 --> 00:58:32,054
You know, Dad, we should
start camping more often.

864
00:58:32,174 --> 00:58:35,355
You're right. Camping is good.
Time for bed.

865
00:58:35,659 --> 00:58:39,862
- It's only 10:00.
- Yeah, 10:00. Time for bed.

866
00:58:40,054 --> 00:58:41,684
Good night.

867
00:58:45,075 --> 00:58:49,111
Hey, don't you wanna thank Victoria
for this delicious dinner?

868
00:58:49,136 --> 00:58:52,942
Thanks for dinner. I never saw
anybody cook potatoes that way.

869
00:58:54,887 --> 00:58:58,121
I'm glad you liked it.
Good night, Jonah.

870
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:05,739
Yeah, we don't see a lot of potatoes
around here. We're rice men.

871
00:59:26,798 --> 00:59:29,102
Oh, God.

872
00:59:57,145 --> 01:00:01,262
Oh! Oh!
Ow.

873
01:00:01,371 --> 01:00:03,059
- I'm sorry, Walter.
- I'm okay.

874
01:00:03,084 --> 01:00:04,285
I'm sorry.

875
01:00:08,190 --> 01:00:10,280
<i>- Hello.
- Turn on your radio.</i>

876
01:00:10,471 --> 01:00:12,564
- What?
<i>- The kid is on.</i>

877
01:00:12,589 --> 01:00:15,162
<i>You've got me listening to this garbage.
Go, turn it on.</i>

878
01:00:15,187 --> 01:00:16,386
Who is it?

879
01:00:17,808 --> 01:00:21,861
It's Becky. She's having
trouble with Rick again.

880
01:00:22,019 --> 01:00:25,189
I'll go downstairs.
Becky, I'll call you right back.

881
01:00:27,921 --> 01:00:30,581
I'm sorry, Walter.
Are you bleeding?

882
01:00:51,322 --> 01:00:53,282
<i>He's kissing her right this minute!</i>

883
01:00:53,472 --> 01:00:54,522
<i>Oh, really?</i>

884
01:00:54,596 --> 01:00:58,245
<i>Jonah, tell the truth:
Are you spying on your father?</i>

885
01:00:58,324 --> 01:01:03,471
<i>- Who is he kissing?
- I have to make them stop.</i>

886
01:01:03,565 --> 01:01:05,538
How will I explain this to Walter?

887
01:01:05,648 --> 01:01:07,346
<i>She came over and cooked dinner.</i>

888
01:01:07,424 --> 01:01:10,660
<i>She brought two bags of groceries
like she was staying here for a year!</i>

889
01:01:10,730 --> 01:01:15,058
<i>Jonah, it's good that your father's dating.
It's just hard on you.</i>

890
01:01:15,083 --> 01:01:19,736
<i>It's something you think you want, but then
when it actually happens, it scares you.</i>

891
01:01:19,761 --> 01:01:20,742
<i>That's not true.</i>

892
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:21,897
<i>Okay, now think.</i>

893
01:01:22,099 --> 01:01:26,545
<i>Shouldn't your father be the judge of
whether someone is right or wrong for him?</i>

894
01:01:26,585 --> 01:01:28,913
<i>He's not sane enough
to judge anything.</i>

895
01:01:28,999 --> 01:01:30,835
Now he's kissing her on the lips.

896
01:01:30,881 --> 01:01:34,767
My dad's been captured by a ho!
What am I going to do?

897
01:01:34,865 --> 01:01:39,848
<i>Jonah, calm down. Tomorrow, when you're
sitting down to breakfast with your Dad,</i>

898
01:01:39,957 --> 01:01:45,623
<i>tell him how you feel. It's not good
to keep your feelings inside you.</i>

899
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:53,802
Miss Scarlet. In the broom closet.
With the radio.

900
01:01:54,690 --> 01:01:59,810
Walter, you scared me.
Don't ever do that again.

901
01:02:03,490 --> 01:02:05,295
I thought I saw
a black widow spider.

902
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:08,240
You scared me to death.
You scared Victoria to death.

903
01:02:08,334 --> 01:02:09,732
It was right over there.

904
01:02:09,935 --> 01:02:13,552
Next time you think you see a black
widow spider I want you to say:

905
01:02:13,610 --> 01:02:18,057
"Dad, excuse me, but I believe a
poisonous insect is in the house."

906
01:02:18,159 --> 01:02:21,588
And I will calmly come and take care of it.
You scream like that again, I'll kill you.

907
01:02:21,665 --> 01:02:24,706
Becky heard this guy on the radio,
she was sure it was Rick.

908
01:02:24,807 --> 01:02:26,274
She was completely hysterical.

909
01:02:26,307 --> 01:02:30,229
And then it turned out
the guy lived in Duluth.

910
01:02:30,254 --> 01:02:31,807
Where's Duluth?

911
01:02:32,096 --> 01:02:33,478
That doesn't make any sense.

912
01:02:33,503 --> 01:02:36,682
I know, Walter.
It doesn't make any sense at all.

913
01:02:36,788 --> 01:02:42,213
- Thank God my life is in place.
- Duluth? That's in North Dakota.

914
01:02:56,944 --> 01:02:59,904
I love this letter.
You have to write to her.

915
01:03:00,072 --> 01:03:01,862
You think so?

916
01:03:02,032 --> 01:03:05,622
It's Y-O-H.
Yeah. What's that?

917
01:03:05,786 --> 01:03:07,536
Your only hope.

918
01:03:19,256 --> 01:03:23,579
I thought I would look into doing
a story on those radio shows.

919
01:03:24,477 --> 01:03:27,055
You probably will have to go
somewhere to really look into them.

920
01:03:27,249 --> 01:03:28,945
Definitely.

921
01:03:48,368 --> 01:03:52,461
- Couldn't you do a phone interview?
- Not for the kind of piece I wanna do.

922
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:57,016
- I won't be in Chicago for that long.
- When you get back, I'll be gone.

923
01:03:57,244 --> 01:04:01,374
- Then I'll see you in New York.
- Okay, I'll get it.

924
01:04:05,614 --> 01:04:10,548
<i>This is Captain Browning.
We're about cruising at 35,000 feet.</i>

925
01:04:10,657 --> 01:04:16,127
<i>The weather is clear to the west and we
expect arrival in Seattle on schedule.</i>

926
01:04:16,381 --> 01:04:18,381
Don't you hate flying?

927
01:04:18,501 --> 01:04:23,883
Yes, I do. And I've just told the most
terrible one to the man I'm about to marry.

928
01:04:24,305 --> 01:04:27,110
Do you feel that any
lie is a betrayal?

929
01:04:28,081 --> 01:04:31,921
- I said flying.
- Ooh...

930
01:04:38,258 --> 01:04:41,851
- Thanks for bringing me here.
- Well, he likes the planes.

931
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:45,164
Can I bring something back for you?
A souvenir?

932
01:04:45,292 --> 01:04:47,042
Does he like those
little snow globes?

933
01:04:47,128 --> 01:04:49,633
You know, you shake them up
and then the snow floats down.

934
01:04:49,729 --> 01:04:53,221
Sure, I'd really like that.
Thank you so much.

935
01:04:57,475 --> 01:04:59,935
- He's 8.
- He's good at it.

936
01:05:00,131 --> 01:05:03,717
I've read an article about this.
Children are hideous at the age of 8.

937
01:05:03,811 --> 01:05:05,459
- It's quite normal.
- Well...

938
01:05:06,201 --> 01:05:10,412
Maybe when I come back, the two of us ought
to spend some time together on our own.

939
01:05:10,617 --> 01:05:12,311
What do you think?

940
01:05:16,536 --> 01:05:19,051
Bye.
Bye, Jonah.

941
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:20,231
Bye.

942
01:05:24,864 --> 01:05:25,957
Jonah.

943
01:05:27,054 --> 01:05:31,066
Listen to me.
You don't know Victoria.

944
01:05:31,254 --> 01:05:35,968
I hardly know her myself.
She's, in fact, a mystery to me.

945
01:05:36,232 --> 01:05:39,132
She tosses her hair a lot.
Why does she do this?

946
01:05:39,351 --> 01:05:42,546
I have no idea. Is it a twitch?
Does she need a haircut?

947
01:05:42,571 --> 01:05:45,647
Could she use a barrette
to keep her hair out of her face?

948
01:05:47,021 --> 01:05:49,903
These are the things I'm
willing to get to the bottom of.

949
01:05:50,402 --> 01:05:54,532
That is why I am dating her.

950
01:05:54,698 --> 01:06:00,162
That's all I'm doing. I'm not living
with her. I'm not marrying her.

951
01:06:00,261 --> 01:06:02,694
Can you appreciate the difference?

952
01:06:03,770 --> 01:06:08,167
This is what single people do. They try
other people on and see how they fit.

953
01:06:08,277 --> 01:06:11,496
But everybody's an adjustment.
Nobody's perfect.

954
01:06:11,909 --> 01:06:14,433
There's no such thing
as a perfect...

955
01:06:30,629 --> 01:06:31,668
Come on.

956
01:06:34,821 --> 01:06:38,031
Dad, I was talking to
Jessica about reincarnation.

957
01:06:38,199 --> 01:06:40,582
She says you knew Annie
in another life.

958
01:06:40,699 --> 01:06:42,816
- Who's Annie?
- The one who wrote us.

959
01:06:42,917 --> 01:06:46,580
But Jessica says, you and Annie
never got together in that life.

960
01:06:46,605 --> 01:06:49,271
So your hearts are like
puzzles with missing pieces.

961
01:06:49,296 --> 01:06:51,685
And when you get together,
the puzzle's complete.

962
01:06:51,748 --> 01:06:52,904
Goddamn it.

963
01:06:53,123 --> 01:06:54,709
The reason I know this
and you don't,

964
01:06:54,798 --> 01:06:59,218
is because I'm younger and pure, so
I'm more in touch with cosmic forces.

965
01:06:59,417 --> 01:07:01,000
Who told you this stuff?

966
01:07:01,025 --> 01:07:02,133
Jessica.

967
01:07:02,253 --> 01:07:05,446
I sincerely hope you're
not marrying Jessica.

<i>I watched him play with

994
01:09:51,476 --> 01:09:53,083
<i>Did you talk to him?</i>

995
01:09:53,665 --> 01:09:55,072
Couldn't do it.

996
01:09:57,697 --> 01:09:59,080
How did I get here?

997
01:09:59,187 --> 01:10:01,147
<i>You told a lie and got on a plane.</i>

998
01:10:01,314 --> 01:10:03,072
That's not what I mean.

999
01:10:04,523 --> 01:10:06,693
I'm going back over
there tomorrow

1000
01:10:06,859 --> 01:10:08,483
and talk to him. I am.

1001
01:10:08,577 --> 01:10:12,323
<i>- Okay. Good. Goodbye.</i>
- Beck.

1002
01:10:12,447 --> 01:10:13,549
<i>What?</i>

1003
01:10:16,159 --> 01:10:20,657
- Is this crazy?
<i>- No, that's the weirdest part about it.</i>

1004
01:10:21,873 --> 01:10:25,529
Thank you. I love you.

1005
01:10:26,302 --> 01:10:27,818
Good night.

1006
01:11:30,690 --> 01:11:34,002
It's so good to see you.
Where's Greg?

1007
01:11:57,883 --> 01:11:58,976
Hello.

1008
01:12:00,677 --> 01:12:01,750
Hello.

1009
01:12:08,643 --> 01:12:12,314
<i>- So then what happened?
- So then I left, obviously.</i>

1010
01:12:13,033 --> 01:12:15,073
You were standing in
the middle of the street?

1011
01:12:15,098 --> 01:12:18,768
You know that dream when you're walking down the
street naked and everyone is looking at you.

1012
01:12:18,986 --> 01:12:20,356
I love that dream.

1013
01:12:20,666 --> 01:12:24,564
That was nothing compared
to this humiliation. Nothing!

1014
01:12:24,589 --> 01:12:27,080
- But he saw you, right?
- He saw me.

1015
01:12:27,173 --> 01:12:30,141
- You were face to face.
- He said hello.

1016
01:12:30,172 --> 01:12:31,773
He said hello.
And what did you say?

1017
01:12:31,866 --> 01:12:35,781
- And all I could say was hello.
- Oh, my God.

1018
01:12:36,921 --> 01:12:42,121
<i>- All I could say was hello.</i>
- It's a sign.

1019
01:12:42,588 --> 01:12:46,979
It's a sign that I have watched
this movie too many times.

1020
01:12:47,901 --> 01:12:51,050
So stupid!
From the minute I listened...

1021
01:12:51,075 --> 01:12:54,797
to that stupid programme on the radio,
I've been a complete jerk.

1022
01:12:54,822 --> 01:12:58,188
- You are not a jerk.
- Thank you. An idiot!

1023
01:12:58,611 --> 01:13:02,921
- You don't know who she was, Annie.
- I saw her. I have a picture of her.

1024
01:13:02,946 --> 01:13:04,595
I'll show you a picture of her.

1025
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:07,517
That detective in Seattle
sent me a picture of her.

1026
01:13:07,542 --> 01:13:11,224
Here! See, that's exactly
what she looks like.

1027
01:13:11,955 --> 01:13:14,157
This is a picture
of someone's back.

1028
01:13:14,276 --> 01:13:16,775
Well, it's her and he
was crazy about her.

1029
01:13:17,557 --> 01:13:21,091
- What's this?
- This is from Seattle.

1030
01:13:29,221 --> 01:13:30,635
Becky.

1031
01:13:32,914 --> 01:13:34,736
So I mailed your letter.

1032
01:13:37,187 --> 01:13:41,369
"Dear Annie. Thanks for your letter.
It was great.

1033
01:13:41,598 --> 01:13:43,611
You sound neat.

1034
01:13:46,595 --> 01:13:52,329
We're very excited about meeting you in New
York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are...

1035
01:13:53,103 --> 01:13:55,415
M-F-E-O.

1036
01:13:56,340 --> 01:14:00,345
See you soon.
Sleepless in Seattle."

1037
01:14:00,876 --> 01:14:03,666
M-F-E-O?

1038
01:14:06,649 --> 01:14:08,649
Made for each other.

1039
01:14:10,352 --> 01:14:13,883
It's cute. It's like a little clue.

1040
01:14:18,268 --> 01:14:21,648
So he can't write.
Big deal.

1041
01:14:21,673 --> 01:14:24,735
Verbal ability is a highly
overrated thing in a guy.

1042
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:27,578
And our pathetic need for it is
what gets us into so much trouble.

1043
01:14:27,603 --> 01:14:31,367
I'm going to run back to Walter's
arms, if he'll still have me.

1044
01:14:31,462 --> 01:14:32,953
What about the letter?

1045
01:14:33,085 --> 01:14:37,078
It's nothing. It was written before
I went out there. Before the ho.

1046
01:14:40,290 --> 01:14:43,670
The only thing is,
she didn't look like a ho.

1047
01:14:43,835 --> 01:14:47,295
She looked like somebody we
would have been friends with.

1048
01:14:48,964 --> 01:14:50,334
Ugh!

1049
01:14:51,328 --> 01:14:53,611
You saw her in the airport
and then here?

1050
01:14:53,636 --> 01:14:56,889
And I tried to talk to her. It was like
I knew her or something. It was weird.

1051
01:14:56,914 --> 01:14:58,515
You mean like a déjà-vu thing?

1052
01:14:58,548 --> 01:15:01,976
It was very French déjà-vu-ish
kind of thing. Oui?

1053
01:15:02,001 --> 01:15:05,461
Oui. At least you're out there seeing
people again. That's terrific.

1054
01:15:06,190 --> 01:15:08,501
Well, I mean, there's
really just the one.

1055
01:15:08,625 --> 01:15:12,530
- Victoria.
- You don't like Victoria?

1056
01:15:12,696 --> 01:15:15,804
- She laughs like a hyena.
- Is this true?

1057
01:15:15,829 --> 01:15:16,992
No!

1058
01:15:17,969 --> 01:15:21,647
Sort of. Yeah, a little bit.
But, tell them what you did.

1059
01:15:21,672 --> 01:15:23,522
- Dad...
- Tell them about the radio show.

1060
01:15:23,547 --> 01:15:24,444
- Go ahead.
- Dad...

1061
01:15:24,469 --> 01:15:25,953
They wanna hear it. Go ahead.
Tell them. Tell them.

1062
01:15:25,978 --> 01:15:29,812
Christmas Eve, he phones in
one of those radio call-in shows.

1063
01:15:29,837 --> 01:15:34,750
- And tells them I need a new wife.
- Oh, you're kidding.

1064
01:15:34,844 --> 01:15:36,523
That's so sweet.

1065
01:15:36,836 --> 01:15:39,803
Now he's obsessed with
this one woman who wrote me.

1066
01:15:39,828 --> 01:15:41,209
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

1067
01:15:41,234 --> 01:15:43,969
She wants to meet me at the
top of Empire State Building.

1068
01:15:44,062 --> 01:15:46,265
On Valentine's Day.

1069
01:15:46,905 --> 01:15:49,366
- It's like that movie.
- What movie?

1070
01:15:49,459 --> 01:15:52,287
An Affair to Remember.
Did you ever see it?

1071
01:15:52,396 --> 01:15:57,447
Oh, God. Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr.
Is that "Karr" or "Kerr"?

1072
01:15:57,746 --> 01:15:58,840
Kerr.

1073
01:15:59,543 --> 01:16:03,574
Okay. She's gonna meet him at the
top of the Empire State Building.

1074
01:16:03,676 --> 01:16:06,043
Only she got hit by a taxi.

1075
01:16:06,373 --> 01:16:10,973
And he waited and waited.
And it was raining, I think.

1076
01:16:11,571 --> 01:16:17,748
And then she's too proud
to tell him that she's...

1077
01:16:20,553 --> 01:16:25,796
crippled. And he's too proud
to find out why she doesn't come.

1078
01:16:26,593 --> 01:16:30,480
But he comes to see her anyway.
And I forget why, but...

1079
01:16:30,882 --> 01:16:34,119
Oh, it's so amazing
when he comes to see her.

1080
01:16:34,323 --> 01:16:39,604
Because he doesn't even notice
that she doesn't get up to say hello.

1081
01:16:39,831 --> 01:16:42,416
And he's very bitter.

1082
01:16:43,384 --> 01:16:47,673
You think he's just going
to walk out the door...

1083
01:16:47,821 --> 01:16:51,044
and never know why she's
just lying there.

1084
01:16:51,069 --> 01:16:57,063
You know, like on the couch with this
blanket over her shrivelled little legs.

1085
01:16:57,663 --> 01:16:58,593
And...

1086
01:16:58,959 --> 01:17:01,600
- Are you all right?
- She's fine.

1087
01:17:01,763 --> 01:17:05,771
And suddenly, he goes,
"I saw the painting"

1088
01:17:05,864 --> 01:17:08,857
And he, like, goes to the bedroom.

1089
01:17:08,980 --> 01:17:11,512
And he looks, and he comes
out and looks at her.

1090
01:17:11,537 --> 01:17:16,678
And he kind of just...
They know and hug and it's so...

1091
01:17:17,587 --> 01:17:20,889
- That's a chick's movie.
- I would say so.

1092
01:17:21,168 --> 01:17:24,668
What kind of a person would write
to someone they heard on the radio?

1093
01:17:24,693 --> 01:17:27,676
I got hundreds of letters
from women all over the country.

1094
01:17:27,701 --> 01:17:28,871
Desperate women.

1095
01:17:28,948 --> 01:17:32,622
Just because someone is looking for a
nice guy, it doesn't make them desperate.

1096
01:17:32,647 --> 01:17:34,350
How about rapacious
and love-starved?

1097
01:17:34,405 --> 01:17:35,015
No.

1098
01:17:35,101 --> 01:17:37,904
It's easier to be killed by a
terrorist than to find a husband...

1099
01:17:37,929 --> 01:17:40,480
- after the age of 40.
- That is absolutely untrue!

1100
01:17:40,504 --> 01:17:42,507
Right, honey. Right.

1101
01:17:42,925 --> 01:17:44,835
Well, I'm not looking
for a mail-order bride.

1102
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:49,229
I just want somebody that I can have a
decent conversation with over dinner.

1103
01:17:49,315 --> 01:17:53,719
You know, without it falling down into weepy
tears over some movie that she just saw.

1104
01:17:53,744 --> 01:17:54,696
She's very emotional.

1105
01:17:54,721 --> 01:17:56,412
Although, I cried at the
end of The Dirty Dozen.

1106
01:17:56,437 --> 01:17:58,203
- Well, who didn't?
- Jim Brown was throwing...

1107
01:17:58,228 --> 01:18:00,427
these hand grenades
down these air shafts.

1108
01:18:00,452 --> 01:18:05,232
And Richard Jaeckel and Lee Marvin we sitting
on top of this armoured personnel carrier.

1109
01:18:05,257 --> 01:18:08,136
They were dressed up like Nazis.
And it was...

1110
01:18:08,187 --> 01:18:09,874
Trini Lopez...
Isn't he?

1111
01:18:10,851 --> 01:18:14,404
He busted his neck when they were
parachuting down behind the Nazi lines.

1112
01:18:14,429 --> 01:18:15,239
Stop it!

1113
01:18:15,264 --> 01:18:20,251
Richard Jaeckel, at the beginning, he had
on a shiny helmet, because he was an MP.

1114
01:18:20,330 --> 01:18:24,423
<i>- Please, no more.</i>
- God, I love that movie.

1115
01:18:33,477 --> 01:18:36,376
This is the best movie
I've ever seen in my life.

1116
01:18:36,453 --> 01:18:37,961
What's so great about it?

1117
01:18:38,259 --> 01:18:40,673
You have to find her, Jonah.
You have to go to her.

1118
01:18:40,775 --> 01:18:43,290
Do you know how much money
it costs to go to New York?

1119
01:18:43,376 --> 01:18:47,446
Nobody knows.
It changes practically every day.

1120
01:18:47,758 --> 01:18:49,448
How much money do you have?

1121
01:18:49,621 --> 01:18:50,961
80 dollars.

1122
01:18:51,172 --> 01:18:55,752
- I have 42. That'll probably cover cabs.
- But how would I get there?

1123
01:18:56,589 --> 01:18:59,181
Honey, I have to run these
tickets over to someone.

1124
01:18:59,206 --> 01:19:01,380
Can you keep an eye on things
out front till I get back?

1125
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:02,599
Sure, Mum.

1126
01:19:13,619 --> 01:19:16,830
You want a window seat or aisle?
Window.

1127
01:19:17,026 --> 01:19:19,939
- You want a fruit plate?
- I don't know. Do I?

1128
01:19:19,963 --> 01:19:21,975
I'd rather die than
eat airplane food.

1129
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:24,289
I'm telling them you're 12 so
you can fly unaccompanied...

1130
01:19:24,314 --> 01:19:26,696
and the stewardess won't carry
you around and stuff like that.

1131
01:19:26,721 --> 01:19:29,360
Are you crazy?
Who'd believe I'm 12?

1132
01:19:29,501 --> 01:19:32,189
If it's in the computer,
they'll believe anything.

1133
01:19:32,267 --> 01:19:33,790
Are you sure?

1134
01:19:34,241 --> 01:19:36,661
Do you want me to say that you're
really, really short for your age,

1135
01:19:36,694 --> 01:19:39,123
and they shouldn't say anything
because it would hurt your feelings?

1136
01:19:39,148 --> 01:19:41,471
Yeah. That's a great idea!

1137

1139
01:19:58,633 --> 01:19:59,900
Walter.

1140
01:20:01,516 --> 01:20:05,430
- You're gonna miss the train.
- No, I'm not.

1141
01:20:05,455 --> 01:20:11,065
I'm so happy, Becky. Finally, I feel happy.
This is right. This is real.

1142
01:20:11,135 --> 01:20:13,783
Everything else is what happens
when you watch too many movies.

1143
01:20:13,820 --> 01:20:16,410
And you completely lose
sight of what counts.

1144
01:20:16,573 --> 01:20:18,373
Please, don't tell
anybody what happened.

1145
01:20:18,533 --> 01:20:21,912
Because I would be so absolutely
mortified if anyone knew I did anything

1146
01:20:22,078 --> 01:20:24,708
even remotely close
to what I have done.

1147
01:20:24,872 --> 01:20:26,401
Thank you, thank you.
Do you promise?

1148
01:20:26,426 --> 01:20:29,988
I promise.
Sleepless in Seattle is history.

1154
01:21:01,102 --> 01:21:02,742
- I was just...
- I was just...

1155
01:21:04,035 --> 01:21:05,955
- Go ahead.
- No, you go.

1156
01:21:06,121 --> 01:21:10,964
Okay. Well, I was just gonna
say that ever since Christmas...

1157
01:21:11,709 --> 01:21:15,871
you've been different,
kind of distracted, distant.

1158
01:21:15,964 --> 01:21:22,195
But now it feels as if you're
coming back from wherever you were.

1159
01:21:22,271 --> 01:21:23,901
I am.

1160
01:21:25,690 --> 01:21:27,280
I was just...

1161
01:21:28,342 --> 01:21:32,052
I just... I just got...
I think I got nervous.

1162
01:21:32,646 --> 01:21:34,727
But that's normal, right?

1163
01:21:34,858 --> 01:21:39,863
I mean, don't you ever
feel nervous about... you know?

1164
01:21:40,696 --> 01:21:44,550
- What?
- Forever.

1165
01:21:46,326 --> 01:21:47,916
No.

1166
01:21:51,065 --> 01:21:52,564
Well...

1167
01:21:53,833 --> 01:21:55,598
I did and...

1168
01:21:55,900 --> 01:22:00,634
You know what I think?
I think I thought it was too perfect.

1169
01:22:00,704 --> 01:22:01,775
You know...

1170
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:07,442
I started to wonder if we were the human
equivalent of two rights making a wrong.

1171
01:22:07,637 --> 01:22:09,052
You know what it was?

1172
01:22:09,223 --> 01:22:13,660
It was like kismet, but not,
if you see what I mean.

1173
01:22:14,437 --> 01:22:15,754
You have to grow up.

1174
01:22:15,847 --> 01:22:19,496
You just can't keep having all these
adolescent fantasies about...

1175
01:22:19,609 --> 01:22:21,379
how exciting life is gonna be.

1176
01:22:21,404 --> 01:22:24,000
Don't hate me,
but I love this pattern.

1177
01:22:24,101 --> 01:22:26,016
- You couldn't.
- I do.

1178
01:22:26,157 --> 01:22:28,969
This is just like my
grandmother's china.

1179
01:22:29,062 --> 01:22:31,142
How many place settings?

1180
01:22:31,556 --> 01:22:33,063
Ten.

1181
01:22:35,832 --> 01:22:39,964
Exactly. Eight is too few,
twelve is...

1182
01:22:40,542 --> 01:22:41,957
Too many.

1183
01:23:05,402 --> 01:23:09,042
- Walter.
<i>- It was my mother's.</i>

1184
01:23:10,806 --> 01:23:12,966
I had them size it down.

1185
01:23:14,507 --> 01:23:16,837
She had really fat fingers.

1186
01:23:19,124 --> 01:23:23,780
It's so beautiful.
It's exactly what I'd pick out...

1187
01:23:24,139 --> 01:23:27,577
if I had every ring in the whole
world to choose from.

1188
01:23:29,801 --> 01:23:31,194
You see what I mean?

1189
01:23:31,227 --> 01:23:34,879
There are people who would like a
relationship to be full of surprises,

1190
01:23:34,904 --> 01:23:39,249
but I am not one of those people.
No, siree.

1191
01:23:39,772 --> 01:23:42,288
Surprises are highly overrated.

1192
01:23:45,196 --> 01:23:46,820
I'm leaving first thing
in the morning,

1193
01:23:46,845 --> 01:23:48,375
but I'm only gonna
be gone one night.

1194
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:49,806
Clarise is gonna be here.

1195
01:23:49,831 --> 01:23:53,128
So you'll be able to see plenty of
Geraldo and Nightmare on Elm Street 12.

1196
01:23:53,153 --> 01:23:56,010
- I will never know.
- Are you going with her?

1197
01:23:57,195 --> 01:23:59,648
I'm going with Victoria, yes.

1198
01:24:01,623 --> 01:24:04,357
Don't try anything tricky. Understand?

1199
01:24:07,462 --> 01:24:10,716
Don't go rolling in poison ivy
as soon as I leave the house.

1200
01:24:11,052 --> 01:24:14,262
Or lock yourself in the closet or do
anything that makes you need stitches.

1201
01:24:14,287 --> 01:24:16,334
If your finger falls off,
it's staying off.

1202
01:24:16,359 --> 01:24:18,735
No one's gonna pack it on
ice and take you to hospital,

1203
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:21,294
so that you can be a
breakthrough in laser surgery.

1204
01:24:21,935 --> 01:24:24,044
Is this about that
woman in Baltimore?

1205
01:24:24,119 --> 01:24:25,325
Annie.

1206
01:24:29,509 --> 01:24:32,212
- I don't care what you do!
- Good! Fine!

1207
01:24:32,332 --> 01:24:35,337
I'll tell you what I'm doing this weekend.
I'm getting laid.

1208
01:24:35,431 --> 01:24:37,806
It is 1990s and
nobody's getting laid.

1209
01:24:37,831 --> 01:24:40,459
I'm the only man in the America
who's getting laid this weekend.

1210
01:24:40,484 --> 01:24:44,886
And I haven't been laid that much.
Six girls in college. Maybe seven.

1211
01:24:45,855 --> 01:24:47,347
How long have you been there?

1212
01:24:47,527 --> 01:24:48,652
Forever.

1213
01:24:48,878 --> 01:24:50,275
What did you hear me just say?

1214
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:52,667
"Six girls in college.
Maybe seven."

1215
01:24:52,777 --> 01:24:55,597
Seven. Eight!
Mary Kelly.

1216
01:24:55,696 --> 01:24:57,266
This is the one I like.

1217
01:25:00,026 --> 01:25:03,741
Jonah, the fact is, you're
not gonna to like any woman,

1218
01:25:03,766 --> 01:25:05,342
because it isn't your mother.

1219
01:25:05,367 --> 01:25:06,766
How do you know?

1220
01:25:07,063 --> 01:25:10,852
- What's wrong with Annie?
- Oh, Jonah, shut up!

1221
01:25:11,101 --> 01:25:15,289
Shut up? Shut up?
Mum never said shut up to me.

1222
01:25:15,382 --> 01:25:16,881
Mum never yelled at me.

1223
01:25:16,906 --> 01:25:19,925
- This conversation is finished.
- Why can't we go to New York?

1224
01:25:19,950 --> 01:25:22,753
There is no way that we
are going on a plane...

1225
01:25:22,778 --> 01:25:25,229
to meet some woman who could
be a crazy, sick lunatic.

1226
01:25:25,254 --> 01:25:28,033
- Didn't you see Fatal Attraction?
- You wouldn't let me.

1227
01:25:28,058 --> 01:25:30,501
Well, I saw it!
And it scared the shit out of me.

1228
01:25:30,526 --> 01:25:33,116
It scared the shit out
of every man in America!

1229
01:25:34,505 --> 01:25:36,996
I'm not leaving till
you say yes.

1230
01:25:42,822 --> 01:25:44,760
I hate you! I hate you!
I hate you!

1231
01:25:44,785 --> 01:25:47,164
Fine!
You'll have a lot to tell Oprah...

1232
01:25:47,189 --> 01:25:48,989
how your dad destroyed your life

1233
01:25:49,014 --> 01:25:52,596
because he had to go off for a
weekend special at the Holiday Inn!

1234
01:26:07,883 --> 01:26:11,172
Jonah, Clarise is here
and I've got to go.

1235
01:26:13,182 --> 01:26:14,578
Hey, Jonah.

1236
01:26:17,653 --> 01:26:18,868
Jonah?

1237
01:26:21,855 --> 01:26:25,566
All right. Jonah, listen,
I've got to go.

1238
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:30,168
Jonah.

1239
01:26:30,386 --> 01:26:31,488
<i>Jonah.</i>

1240
01:26:34,299 --> 01:26:35,605
Hey, Jonah.

1241
01:26:39,471 --> 01:26:40,572
Jonah!

1242
01:26:42,703 --> 01:26:43,863
Jonah!

1243
01:26:46,384 --> 01:26:47,885
Jonah!

1244
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,764
Jessica, honey. You have
to tell us where he is.

1245
01:26:57,789 --> 01:26:59,984
Jonah's daddy is very upset.

1246
01:27:00,711 --> 01:27:05,242
Jessica, this is your father.
Tell us where he is. Right this minute!

1247
01:27:08,518 --> 01:27:10,773
- N-Y.
- What is that?

1248
01:27:10,867 --> 01:27:11,765
"No way."

1249
01:27:11,849 --> 01:27:13,164
That's N-W!

1250
01:27:14,964 --> 01:27:18,889
New York. He's on
his way to New York.

1251
01:27:18,993 --> 01:27:20,374
What? How?

1252
01:27:20,399 --> 01:27:23,529
- United, 597.
- Jessica.

1253
01:27:23,622 --> 01:27:25,732
- When does it leave?
- Seven thirty.

1254
01:27:32,999 --> 01:27:36,491
Here you go. Here's a nice pin
for you for flying with us.

1255
01:27:36,516 --> 01:27:37,092
Thank you.

1256
01:27:37,117 --> 01:27:39,132
You're welcome.
Can I take this for you?

1257
01:27:39,157 --> 01:27:39,812
No.

1258
01:27:56,006 --> 01:27:58,176
- Where to, kid?
- Empire State Building.

1259
01:27:58,201 --> 01:27:59,263
Hold on.

1260
01:27:59,895 --> 01:28:01,200
Empire State Building.

1261
01:28:01,225 --> 01:28:04,412
Get a little further away
from the curb next time, mac.

1262
01:28:06,469 --> 01:28:11,730
There it is. What are you going
to do up there? Spit off the top?

1263
01:28:11,755 --> 01:28:15,078
No, I'm going to meet
my new mother.

1264
01:28:35,408 --> 01:28:38,168
Excuse me. I'm Jonah.
Are you Annie?

1265
01:28:38,193 --> 01:28:40,377
No, I'm Cynthia.

1266
01:28:47,626 --> 01:28:50,204
Excuse me, are you Annie?

1267
01:29:28,454 --> 01:29:30,548
Great table. Thanks.

1268
01:29:32,863 --> 01:29:34,243
Is something wrong?

1269
01:29:35,742 --> 01:29:38,695
- Can I get you a drink?
- Some champagne?

1270
01:29:40,112 --> 01:29:41,710
Fine. Fine.

1271
01:29:42,749 --> 01:29:46,581
Can we have a bottle
of Dom DeLuise.

1272
01:29:49,501 --> 01:29:51,382
- Just kidding.
- It was a joke.

1273
01:29:51,407 --> 01:29:53,868
- He meant Dom Perignon.
- I got it.

1274
01:29:56,610 --> 01:29:59,118
Ohh. Beautiful view.

1275
01:29:59,802 --> 01:30:00,915
Walter...

1276
01:30:02,828 --> 01:30:04,914
There's something I have to tell you.

1277
01:30:19,239 --> 01:30:21,739
Hey! Sorry, I have an emergency.

1278
01:30:22,124 --> 01:30:25,528
Money, money, money, see?

1279
01:31:42,235 --> 01:31:46,735
So he could be on top of
the Empire State Building now?

1280
01:31:47,263 --> 01:31:48,250
No.

1281
01:31:49,094 --> 01:31:50,711
I guess he could be.

1282
01:31:50,990 --> 01:31:52,110
No.

1283
01:31:53,814 --> 01:31:56,228
It's not him, Walter. It's me.

1284
01:31:57,709 --> 01:31:59,642
I can't do this.

1285
01:32:01,503 --> 01:32:08,095
Look, Annie, I love you.
But let's leave that out of this.

1286
01:32:09,261 --> 01:32:12,023
I don't want to be someone
that you're settling for.

1287
01:32:12,125 --> 01:32:16,227
I don't want to be someone
that anyone settles for.

1288
01:32:18,062 --> 01:32:22,937
Marriage is hard enough without
bringing such low expectations into it.

1289
01:32:23,469 --> 01:32:24,663
Isn't it?

1290
01:32:25,687 --> 01:32:28,202
Walter, I don't deserve you.

1291
01:32:28,918 --> 01:32:31,304
No, I wouldn't put it that way.

1292
01:32:32,999 --> 01:32:34,995
But... okay.

1293
01:32:51,594 --> 01:32:52,804
You okay?

1294
01:32:53,806 --> 01:32:54,796
Yeah.

1295
01:33:00,694 --> 01:33:02,889
- What?
- Look.

1296
01:33:11,571 --> 01:33:14,938
- It's a sign.
- Who needed a sign?

1297
01:33:15,044 --> 01:33:19,758
Walter, I have to go.

1298
01:33:32,804 --> 01:33:34,289
Jonah!

1299
01:33:36,093 --> 01:33:37,508
Jonah!

1300
01:33:38,508 --> 01:33:40,695
Dad! Dad!

1301
01:33:54,678 --> 01:33:59,280
What if something happened to you?
What if I couldn't get to you?

1302
01:33:59,381 --> 01:34:01,998
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1303
01:34:03,645 --> 01:34:05,936
What would I have done?

1304
01:34:06,864 --> 01:34:09,989
You are my family.
You're all I've got.

1305
01:34:10,184 --> 01:34:12,272
I thought she'd be here.
I thought she'd come.

1306
01:34:12,297 --> 01:34:14,345
We're doing okay, aren't we?
Are we okay?

1307
01:34:14,370 --> 01:34:17,126
Aren't we all right? So far,
have I done anything stupid?

1308
01:34:17,151 --> 01:34:17,932
No.

1309
01:34:17,974 --> 01:34:20,113
Have I screwed it up
for the both of us?

1310
01:34:20,138 --> 01:34:20,940
No.

1311
01:35:14,065 --> 01:35:17,346
- Observation deck?
- Sorry, ma'am, but it's too late.

1312
01:35:17,532 --> 01:35:20,922
Oh. No, please.
I really need to get up there.

1313
01:35:20,947 --> 01:35:23,322
We're closing up.
No more runs tonight.

1314
01:35:29,121 --> 01:35:30,230
Listen...

1315
01:35:31,415 --> 01:35:35,298
can I just take a look?
There's someone I was supposed to meet.

1316
01:35:35,384 --> 01:35:39,954
He's probably not there, but if I don't at
least look, I'll always wonder about it.

1317
01:35:40,345 --> 01:35:43,931
- Cary Grant, right?
- You know that movie?

1318
01:35:44,583 --> 01:35:46,708
It's one of my wife's favourites.

1319
01:35:55,730 --> 01:35:58,636
Maybe when we get home,
we'll get a dog.

1320
01:35:58,917 --> 01:36:00,042
Okay.

1321
01:36:00,234 --> 01:36:01,839
What do you mean, okay?

1322
01:36:02,315 --> 01:36:05,654
- Wouldn't you like to have a dog?
- Sure.

1323
01:36:18,168 --> 01:36:21,074
I'm sorry, ma'am. Empty.

1324
01:36:23,382 --> 01:36:27,480
- Can I take a minute?
- Go ahead.

1325
01:37:41,433 --> 01:37:43,746
I left it by the telescopes.

1326
01:38:10,552 --> 01:38:12,935
- It's you.
- It's me.

1327
01:38:13,130 --> 01:38:16,239
I saw you in the street.

1328
01:38:16,364 --> 01:38:20,532
- Are you Annie?
- Yes.

1329
01:38:23,532 --> 01:38:25,040
You're Annie?

1330
01:38:28,133 --> 01:38:31,735
- This must be yours.
- I'm Jonah.

1331
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:34,910
This is my dad.
His name is Sam.

1332
01:38:34,935 --> 01:38:36,074
Hi, Jonah.

1333
01:38:38,555 --> 01:38:39,643
Sam.

1334
01:38:44,698 --> 01:38:46,713
- And who's this?
- Howard.

1335
01:38:46,814 --> 01:38:49,523
Oh, Howard. Hello, Howard.

1336
01:39:04,944 --> 01:39:06,436
We'd better go.

1337
01:39:13,900 --> 01:39:15,095
