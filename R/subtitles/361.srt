1
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:54,127
Let go of me!

2
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,675
Okay, now I really have a wedgie.
Fred! Velma!

3
00:00:59,842 --> 00:01:03,262
Can you guys hurry it up?
This ghost keeps grabbing...

4
00:01:05,097 --> 00:01:06,807
Please!

5
00:01:06,974 --> 00:01:08,183
Jinkies.

6
00:01:08,684 --> 00:01:11,270
Fred. Come in, Fred.

7
00:01:11,478 --> 00:01:14,815
-Fred! Can you hear me?
-Fredster here, Velms.

8
00:01:15,148 --> 00:01:18,861
Shockingly, Daphne's been
captured again. That's okay.

9
00:01:19,027 --> 00:01:21,613
When the Luna Ghost
rounds the corner with Daphne...

10
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,533
...Shaggy and Scooby will pop out
of the barrel...

11
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,036
You'll activate the conveyor belt,
spilling the oil onto the floor.

12
00:01:30,163 --> 00:01:31,832
Just remember my plan.

13
00:01:32,374 --> 00:01:35,252
Like, chill out, Scooby-Doo.
Stop shaking.

14
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,337
Me? That's you.

15
00:01:37,504 --> 00:01:40,215
Right. It's me. Sorry.

16
00:01:54,354 --> 00:01:57,733
Scooby-Doo, what are you doing, man?

17
00:01:57,941 --> 00:02:00,986
Like, this is no time to...

18
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:04,031
Oh, boy.

19
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:07,743
Like, there's a ghost right behind me,
isn't there?

20
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:13,582
Run!

21
00:02:21,173 --> 00:02:23,300
Go, Shaggy! Go!

22
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:27,054
-Run!
-Like, I'm trying, buddy!

23
00:02:29,306 --> 00:02:31,141
Fred, now!

24
00:02:31,308 --> 00:02:32,518
Hurry up!

25
00:02:33,477 --> 00:02:35,020
-I got him.
-Look out!

26
00:02:36,146 --> 00:02:36,939
Sorry!

27
00:02:51,578 --> 00:02:54,498
-Sorry, Velma.
-I know, Fred.

28
00:02:54,665 --> 00:02:57,334
-Where's the ghost?
-He's right behind us.

29
00:02:57,793 --> 00:02:59,169
Skateboard!

30
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,187
Is he still after us, Scoob?

31
00:03:19,106 --> 00:03:20,315
Banzai!

32
00:03:25,946 --> 00:03:29,992
-Zoinks! Grab the hook!
-Hold on, Shaggy!

33
00:03:46,383 --> 00:03:49,386
Daphne, are you okay?

34
00:03:50,304 --> 00:03:53,724
I'm so over this
damsel-in-distress nonsense.

35
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:55,934
Where's Shagster?

36
00:03:56,894 --> 00:03:59,396
-Like, I'm right here, man.
-Me too.

37
00:03:59,563 --> 00:04:04,193
Scoob, that was fun. Let's grab
another skateboard and do it again.

38
00:04:04,401 --> 00:04:05,861
Yeah.

39
00:04:24,922 --> 00:04:26,423
There you go.

40
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,133
One for you.

41
00:04:29,176 --> 00:04:32,554
Good-Iooking guy.
All right, nice to see you.

42
00:04:32,763 --> 00:04:36,099
-Thanks for saving the factory.
-Pam, any comments?

43
00:04:36,308 --> 00:04:41,480
This is a victory for any celebrity who
wants to make a quality action figure.

44
00:04:41,647 --> 00:04:44,775
-What's the secret of your success?
-Teamwork.

45
00:04:44,942 --> 00:04:49,905
I do a tremendous amount of teamwork,
and I always have a plan. Come on.

46
00:04:50,113 --> 00:04:51,990
Yeah, my plan.

47
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:57,412
I knew from the start there was no
phantom. The Luna Ghost is, in fact...

48
00:05:00,624 --> 00:05:03,752
-Old Man Smithers?
-The creepy janitor?

49
00:05:03,961 --> 00:05:06,255
He wanted revenge after you
refused to go out with him.

50
00:05:06,463 --> 00:05:11,260
How could you, Pam? I'm a lover-boy
of George Clooney-an proportions.

51
00:05:11,802 --> 00:05:16,807
-Fred, how was the ghost able to fly?
-I can answer that. Watch.

52
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:24,231
These balloons fill with a highly
potent helium synthesis...

53
00:05:24,398 --> 00:05:26,400
...giving the Luna Ghost...

54
00:05:27,234 --> 00:05:30,112
...his weightless appearance.

55
00:05:30,988 --> 00:05:35,409
I would have gotten away with it too,
if it weren't for you meddling kids...

56
00:05:35,617 --> 00:05:39,204
...and your dumb dog!
I'll get you for this!

57
00:05:39,413 --> 00:05:41,790
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

58
00:05:47,671 --> 00:05:50,883
Fred, I can't believe you took credit
for my plan again.

59
00:05:51,091 --> 00:05:54,595
Some plan. That ghost pawed me
for an hour and a half.

60
00:05:54,761 --> 00:05:57,181
It's not our fault you always
get kidnapped.

61
00:05:57,347 --> 00:06:01,226
I don't always get kidnapped.
Can't believe you'd say that.

62
00:06:01,393 --> 00:06:04,646
Oh, please.
You come with your own ransom note.

63
00:06:06,398 --> 00:06:08,734
-My glasses!
-Who's helpless now?

64
00:06:08,942 --> 00:06:11,695
I'm going to kill you, Daphne!

65
00:06:12,362 --> 00:06:13,780
Watch the ascot!

66
00:06:13,989 --> 00:06:18,368
You guys, look, I know I'm just
the dude that carries the bags...

67
00:06:18,535 --> 00:06:21,914
...but we all play an important part
in this group.

68
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,709
I mean, we're just like a big,
delicious banana split.

69
00:06:25,876 --> 00:06:28,712
Fred, you're the big banana.

70
00:06:29,463 --> 00:06:33,967
Daphne, you're the pastrami and
gum-flavored ice cream. And Velma...

71
00:06:34,134 --> 00:06:38,430
...you're the sweet-and-sour mustard
sauce that goes on top.

72
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,475
That sounds pretty good, doesn't it?

73
00:06:41,725 --> 00:06:46,522
You know what, Shaggy? You've really
put it in perspective for me.

74
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,023
Thanks.

75
00:06:49,066 --> 00:06:50,400
I quit.

76
00:06:52,069 --> 00:06:54,738
-No.
-No way.

77
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:59,159
You can't quit. I was gonna quit in,
like, two seconds.

78
00:06:59,326 --> 00:07:02,955
Now everyone will think
I copied off the smart girl.

79
00:07:03,121 --> 00:07:04,790
Now, wait a minute.

80
00:07:07,084 --> 00:07:08,544
Maybe I quit.

81
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:14,258
I do. Yeah, I quit.

82
00:07:15,676 --> 00:07:17,886
I'm out of here.

83
00:07:19,179 --> 00:07:20,722
Good riddance.

84
00:07:20,931 --> 00:07:22,891
Don't...
No. Don't go.

85
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,561
Come on, you guys, don't do this.

86
00:07:26,603 --> 00:07:28,730
Please don't go.

87
00:07:31,859 --> 00:07:33,443
Do I quit?

88
00:07:34,444 --> 00:07:35,946
No, Scoob...

89
00:07:36,113 --> 00:07:38,448
...friends don't quit.

90
00:07:40,826 --> 00:07:44,079
It looks like it's just you
and me for a while.

91
00:07:44,288 --> 00:07:46,039
What now, Shaggy?

92
00:07:46,248 --> 00:07:50,919
I guess we'll all just do
what we do best, Scoob.

93
00:07:59,553 --> 00:08:02,055
This is primo.

94
00:08:02,264 --> 00:08:06,310
Man, talk about toasted.

95
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:10,939
Man, the only thing I like better
than an eggplant burger...

96
00:08:11,148 --> 00:08:15,027
...is a chocolate-covered
eggplant burger.

97
00:08:15,235 --> 00:08:17,571
With hot sauce.

98
00:08:19,698 --> 00:08:24,494
Yeah, just another beautiful day
in paradise.

99
00:08:25,329 --> 00:08:29,041
I'm looking for a "Mr. Rogers"
and a "Mr. Doo." The detectives?

100
00:08:29,249 --> 00:08:32,794
It's probably somebody looking for us
to solve some scary mystery.

101
00:08:33,003 --> 00:08:34,046
Nobody home!

102
00:08:34,254 --> 00:08:37,174
Quick, Scoob-o, grab the food-o,
let's scram-o.

103
00:08:37,508 --> 00:08:41,136
I'm looking for a "Mr. Rogers"
and a "Mr. Doo."

104
00:08:44,848 --> 00:08:45,807
Let's go!

105
00:08:47,893 --> 00:08:54,024
I'm sorry, dude. I'd love to help you
out. You look like a really nice guy.

106
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,276
We're not detectives anymore.

107
00:08:56,485 --> 00:08:59,905
I've been sent by Mr. Emile
Mondevarious to invite you...

108
00:09:00,113 --> 00:09:02,533
...to his amusement park,
Spooky Island.

109
00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:07,037
We don't go near places with "spooky,"
"haunted," or "creepy" in the name.

110
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:11,500
-Or hydrocolonic.
-Right, but that's for another reason.

111
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:17,381
But he'd like you to solve a mystery.
He'll pay you a fee of $10,000.

112
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:21,218
It's just, materialism
is not really our bag, man.

113
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:23,220
-Free airfare.
-No, thanks.

114
00:09:23,428 --> 00:09:25,973
-Room and board.
-No, thanks.

115
00:09:26,181 --> 00:09:28,183
And all you can eat.

116
00:09:28,892 --> 00:09:31,520
All you can eat?

117
00:09:46,493 --> 00:09:47,870
Fred?

118
00:09:48,078 --> 00:09:52,040
Velma? Are you going this way?

119
00:09:57,045 --> 00:09:59,047
-How have you...?
-Been?

120
00:09:59,256 --> 00:10:01,758
-Yes.
-Great.

121
00:10:01,967 --> 00:10:04,928
I'm on the lecture circuit
with my new book...

122
00:10:05,429 --> 00:10:10,100
-...Fred on Fred: The Many Faces of Me.
-Jinkies, that's impressive.

123
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,436
And yourself?

124
00:10:12,603 --> 00:10:17,107
I've been working at NASA, developing
hydropowered missile defense systems.

125
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:18,567
But, more importantly...

126
00:10:18,775 --> 00:10:21,361
-...I'm on a journey of self-discovery.
-NASA?

127
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:25,866
Charter service to Spooky Island
will begin boarding momentarily.

128
00:10:26,074 --> 00:10:28,994
What do you mean I can't have
seven carry-on bags?

129
00:10:29,203 --> 00:10:32,206
-That's so economy.
-Crap.

130
00:10:33,582 --> 00:10:38,170
Oh, no. I'm not talking to you guys.

131
00:10:41,757 --> 00:10:44,259
-What are you doing here?
-Isn't it obvious?

132
00:10:44,468 --> 00:10:48,138
We all received the same letter
from one Emile Mondevarious...

133
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:50,307
...the reclusive owner
of Spooky Island.

134
00:10:50,474 --> 00:10:54,686
It's not fair. I was gonna solve
the mystery all by myself.

135
00:10:54,895 --> 00:10:57,689
-And when you get caught?
-I'm a black belt now.

136
00:10:57,898 --> 00:11:01,318
I've transformed my body
into a dangerous weapon.

137
00:11:03,612 --> 00:11:04,571
It's true.

138
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:09,159
Far out. I guess we're, like,
all going to Spooky Island, man.

139
00:11:09,326 --> 00:11:10,827
Where's Scooby?

140
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:18,961
Hello.

141
00:11:20,003 --> 00:11:21,713
Sorry.

142
00:11:22,172 --> 00:11:24,675
They don't allow big dogs
on the plane.

143
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:30,639
You've got to be kidding.

144
00:11:30,848 --> 00:11:33,851
No one is stupid enough
to believe that.

145
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:36,478
Who's the ugly old broad?

146
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,357
-Say hello to Grandma.
-Aloha.

147
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:43,360
Flight 3774 to Spooky Island,
now boarding.

148
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:46,321
I wouldn't have agreed
to come if I knew.

149
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:49,491
Wait, just think about it
for one minute.

150
00:11:49,658 --> 00:11:54,329
Mystery Inc. reunites. We'll be
a team again, just like the old days.

151
00:11:54,705 --> 00:11:55,706
So come on...

152
00:11:55,914 --> 00:12:01,211
...let's do that thing where we all put
our hands in, lift them up, and go:

153
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:05,591
Only if Fred and Velma do it.

154
00:12:07,885 --> 00:12:09,720
People are watching, Shag.

155
00:12:20,189 --> 00:12:23,609
Yeah, Scoob, "roo-hoo."
Come on, buddy.

156
00:12:44,171 --> 00:12:47,090
Now that is a beautiful work of art.

157
00:13:05,359 --> 00:13:09,071
Would you mind me taking a seat
there next to...?

158
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,825
To my grandma. That's my grandma.
Hi, Grandma. Like, no.

159
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:19,373
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

160
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:22,751
Bless you.

161
00:13:24,211 --> 00:13:30,342
I'm sorry. My allergies.
It's usually only dogs that do it.

162
00:13:32,803 --> 00:13:35,430
-Maybe I'd better move.
-No, wait.

163
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:39,059
It's probably just
my grandma's perfume.

164
00:13:39,268 --> 00:13:44,231
Yeah, even I sometimes get
a little allergic, you know. Oh, jeez.

165
00:13:45,315 --> 00:13:49,653
I'm pretty sure Grandma wants to go
back and visit with her pal Velma.

166
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,488
Right, Grandma?

167
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,323
Okay.

168
00:13:58,954 --> 00:14:03,458
Boy, oh, boy, those sure do look
like Scooby Snacks.

169
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,669
I know they're for dogs...

170
00:14:05,836 --> 00:14:09,173
...but they're 100%% vegetarian,
and I love them.

171
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:10,549
Like, me too.

172
00:14:10,757 --> 00:14:14,553
Far out. I've never met another person
who loves Scooby Snacks.

173
00:14:14,761 --> 00:14:16,972
-Me neither.
-I'm Mary Jane.

174
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,059
-Like, that's my favorite name.
-Really?

175
00:14:21,268 --> 00:14:23,270
No way.

176
00:14:28,192 --> 00:14:29,526
Hello.

177
00:14:40,996 --> 00:14:42,247
Grandma?

178
00:14:42,456 --> 00:14:45,542
Velma, it's simple
behavior modification.

179
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:51,006
To cause a dog to discontinue any
action, flick it on the nose. Observe.

180
00:14:51,256 --> 00:14:52,758
Scoob?

181
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,178
See?

182
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:06,271
Sit, Grandma! Bad, Grandma!
Don't eat the kitty!

183
00:15:12,486 --> 00:15:14,821
Welcome to Spooky Island...

184
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:19,576
...the frightfully popular spring break
spot for college students.

185
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:24,373
Catch our Electrical Torture Parade.
It's a Dead World After All.

186
00:15:24,581 --> 00:15:28,460
And the world famous Splatterhorn.

187
00:15:29,253 --> 00:15:33,048
Scooby-Doo!
And the rest of Mystery Inc.

188
00:15:33,257 --> 00:15:36,134
It's marvelous to see you!
How fanta...

189
00:15:36,343 --> 00:15:39,263
I'm sorry.
That's the second time this week.

190
00:15:41,431 --> 00:15:42,599
Thank goodness.

191
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:46,895
It's a new toy.
I'm just getting up to speed with it.

192
00:15:47,104 --> 00:15:49,273
-Welcome.
-Thank goodness.

193
00:15:49,606 --> 00:15:52,526
I was afraid I'd have
to lug those to the hotel.

194
00:15:52,693 --> 00:15:56,947
That's what Spooky Island's about,
realizing your worst fears.

195
00:15:57,364 --> 00:16:02,077
I'm Emile Mondevarious,
the owner of this amusement park.

196
00:16:02,452 --> 00:16:04,454
-You seem less...
-Spooky.

197
00:16:04,621 --> 00:16:06,915
...than we'd have guessed.

198
00:16:07,124 --> 00:16:10,502
I can be pretty spooky
when called upon. I can go:

199
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,090
Claws and everything.

200
00:16:15,883 --> 00:16:18,927
You wouldn't want to run into me
in a dark alley.

201
00:16:19,136 --> 00:16:22,431
-So you're the one who brought us here?
-No.

202
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,101
What brought you here
was your insatiable appetite...

203
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,145
...for a juicy mystery.

204
00:16:29,062 --> 00:16:32,232
The truth is,
Mystery Inc. is broken up.

205
00:16:32,441 --> 00:16:35,027
That's the beauty of something broken.

206
00:16:35,152 --> 00:16:38,071
It can be fixed.
Therein lies its potential.

207
00:16:38,238 --> 00:16:40,991
And I need you to fix Spooky Island.

208
00:16:41,158 --> 00:16:42,576
What's the problem?

209
00:16:42,743 --> 00:16:46,288
I believe somebody's casting a spell
on the students.

210
00:16:47,497 --> 00:16:49,833
Now listen and look around.

211
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:53,670
Notice any difference between those
arriving and those departing?

212
00:16:54,171 --> 00:16:56,757
They look like sober, well-behaved
college kids.

213
00:16:56,924 --> 00:16:59,718
Precisely.
They didn't before they came.

214
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:03,555
They've changed.
In other words, a magic spell.

215
00:17:03,764 --> 00:17:07,059
Carol! Carol, how was the island?

216
00:17:07,267 --> 00:17:09,478
Are you tricking on me?

217
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:15,067
It's me, Brad. We've known each other
since we were 3.

218
00:17:15,275 --> 00:17:17,694
Back off my grill, son!

219
00:17:17,861 --> 00:17:20,155
Carol, what are you doing?

220
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:35,420
I'm terrified. The young people
that come off that barge...

221
00:17:35,629 --> 00:17:40,342
...the people I love the most,
they're in danger.

222
00:17:40,551 --> 00:17:44,847
-I'm going to solve this one first.
-Not before I solve it first.

223
00:17:45,055 --> 00:17:49,518
You'll look like total idiots
when you're captured and I save you.

224
00:17:49,726 --> 00:17:51,311
Thank you. Marvelous.

225
00:17:51,478 --> 00:17:56,024
Maybe we can celebrate later
by having a little spookapalooza.

226
00:17:56,233 --> 00:17:58,485
Spookapalooza?

227
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:06,034
You haven't noticed anything unusual
since you started working here?

228
00:18:06,577 --> 00:18:10,873
-Any weirdoes running around?
-No.

229
00:18:29,683 --> 00:18:32,811
Welcome, dear victims.

230
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:36,940
My name is N' Goo Tuana.

231
00:18:37,107 --> 00:18:41,570
This is my evil best pal, Zarkos.

232
00:18:41,778 --> 00:18:46,617
You may recognize him from Telemundo
as the famous masked wrestler...

233
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:48,076
...Zarkos.

234
00:18:48,285 --> 00:18:50,621
This enchanted island...

235
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:55,000
...is a thoroughfare
to the supernatural realm.

236
00:18:55,209 --> 00:19:00,631
For centuries, it was home to creatures
who lived on the island undisturbed.

237
00:19:03,592 --> 00:19:05,427
But then...

238
00:19:05,636 --> 00:19:07,513
...ten years ago...

239
00:19:07,721 --> 00:19:11,308
...Emile Mondevarious...

240
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:17,272
...antagonized these ancient beings
by building a theme park here.

241
00:19:20,317 --> 00:19:22,986
The creatures are furious, my friends.

242
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,823
And I assure you...

243
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:29,493
...while you party...

244
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,662
...they plot...

245
00:19:31,828 --> 00:19:35,165
...their revenge!

246
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,883
Do my friends frighten you?

247
00:19:47,678 --> 00:19:52,266
They would, if it weren't
for the holographic projectors...

248
00:19:52,432 --> 00:19:56,645
...there, and there and there.

249
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,774
What a smart little one.

250
00:20:13,871 --> 00:20:15,330
Hello, Dead Mike's.

251
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,668
We got a "Mr. Doo" here?

252
00:20:19,877 --> 00:20:22,504
I got a call for a "Mr. Doo."

253
00:20:23,172 --> 00:20:24,590
Melvin Doo?

254
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:27,217
No, Scooby.

255
00:20:29,511 --> 00:20:31,889
-Hello?
-Got a bag...

256
00:20:32,723 --> 00:20:35,559
...of hamburgers here for you.

257
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:39,438
Just walk into the dark,
shadowy part of the forest...

258
00:20:39,646 --> 00:20:42,191
...where no one can see you.

259
00:20:42,399 --> 00:20:43,859
Okay.

260
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,866
-Want a stuffed thingy?
-Nobody can win those.

261
00:20:51,074 --> 00:20:55,704
Fred says it's a worthless talent, that
I should've learned French instead.

262
00:20:55,913 --> 00:21:00,042
I say you don't need to know what
" Voulez-vous coucher avec moi" means...

263
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,586
...to love that song.

264
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:07,883
I think being good at crane machine
is way cooler than French.

265
00:21:09,092 --> 00:21:10,469
Voil.

266
00:21:11,094 --> 00:21:15,933
Nobody's ever given me a stuffed
dismembered head before.

267
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,753
Excuse me.

268
00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:49,299
Now I have to start my voodoo ritual
all over again!

269
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:50,634
Voodoo ritual?

270
00:21:50,843 --> 00:21:55,264
-I was about to sacrifice this chicken.
-That chicken's not alive.

271
00:21:55,472 --> 00:21:59,810
I know. What, did you figure that out
when you saw it didn't have a head?

272
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:03,313
What do you want?
Why you in the voodoo ritual space?

273
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:08,610
I'm looking for clues as to who's
behind the students' strange behavior.

274
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:11,947
Here's a clue:
Purple is a fall color.

275
00:22:12,155 --> 00:22:14,491
-It's the middle of May!
-Pardon?

276
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,786
Do yourself a favor
and get off this island. Go home.

277
00:22:17,995 --> 00:22:21,957
Go home before evil befalls
your skinny, aerobicized booty.

278
00:22:22,165 --> 00:22:24,001
And whatever you do...

279
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:26,336
...do not, I repeat...

280
00:22:26,503 --> 00:22:30,591
...do not go into
that Spooky Island castle.

281
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:35,554
-You want me to go to that castle.
-Didn't you hear what I said?

282
00:22:35,762 --> 00:22:39,099
You knew I'd do the opposite
of what you said.

283
00:22:39,308 --> 00:22:42,394
You told me not to go to the castle
so I would go...

284
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:45,439
...where you set a trap to capture me.

285
00:22:45,647 --> 00:22:46,982
Unless...

286
00:22:47,191 --> 00:22:50,819
...you knew I'd figure it out,
so you told me not to go...

287
00:22:51,028 --> 00:22:54,990
...so I'd think you wanted me to go,
so I wouldn't go.

288
00:22:55,532 --> 00:22:59,745
I'll find out what you're hiding
in that castle. You watch.

289
00:23:00,329 --> 00:23:02,164
What in the world?

290
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:08,253
Hamburgers, where are you?

291
00:23:18,722 --> 00:23:21,183
Hamburgers.

292
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:24,686
Thank you.

293
00:23:47,876 --> 00:23:49,545
Shaggy!

294
00:24:11,441 --> 00:24:13,235
It's been really nice.

295
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:16,488
Shaggy!

296
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:19,950
Monster! Monster!

297
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:21,743
A monster?

298
00:24:27,457 --> 00:24:30,252
Scooby-Doo, quit goofing around, man.

299
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,921
I guess I should go.

300
00:24:36,133 --> 00:24:37,968
Bye, Scooby.

301
00:24:41,138 --> 00:24:42,931
Bless you.

302
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,438
Shaggy. Scooby.

303
00:24:55,819 --> 00:24:56,945
No way.

304
00:24:58,822 --> 00:25:01,617
-Scoob and me don't do castles.
-Why not?

305
00:25:01,825 --> 00:25:06,914
They have paintings that watch you,
suits of armor you think is a statue...

306
00:25:07,122 --> 00:25:11,835
...but there's a guy inside who follows
you every time you turn around.

307
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:15,756
-How many times did that happen?
-Twelve. We're not gonna do it.

308
00:25:15,964 --> 00:25:17,758
That's right.

309
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:19,801
Scooby?

310
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:24,348
Did you hurt your paw?

311
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,685
-Would you do it for a Scooby Snack?
-Oh, boy!

312
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:33,357
-And you'll be fearless?
-Fearless?

313
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:42,074
Hong Kong Phooey,
watch the fists of fury.

314
00:25:42,282 --> 00:25:43,700
Here you go.

315
00:25:44,701 --> 00:25:45,744
Thank you.

316
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:51,083
There's plenty more where that came
from. Let's go before someone sees.

317
00:25:52,876 --> 00:25:55,504
You're not gonna stay out here alone,
are you?

318
00:25:56,046 --> 00:25:57,422
No, thank you.

319
00:26:08,183 --> 00:26:09,852
Oh, boy.

320
00:26:11,895 --> 00:26:15,190
This place is, like, uber creepy.

321
00:26:15,357 --> 00:26:17,526
Yeah, uber creepy.

322
00:26:17,734 --> 00:26:20,946
The only thing missing
is a mindless zombie.

323
00:26:25,701 --> 00:26:30,414
Fred, get back. I found this place.
I call dibs on its clues.

324
00:26:30,581 --> 00:26:33,417
-I've already found some clues.
-What?

325
00:26:34,001 --> 00:26:38,046
I followed some weird footprints here.
It might be dangerous for you.

326
00:26:38,255 --> 00:26:43,093
If anyone messes with me, I'll open
a can of Chinese whoop-ass on them.

327
00:26:47,264 --> 00:26:51,518
-What are you doing here?
-This ride was closed for construction.

328
00:26:51,727 --> 00:26:57,608
It's the most likely place to hatch
a plan. And I wanted to scare Daphne.

329
00:26:57,774 --> 00:27:02,321
Since we're all together,
let's split up and look for more clues.

330
00:27:02,529 --> 00:27:04,573
-Daphne, you and l...
-Typical.

331
00:27:04,781 --> 00:27:06,992
-What?
-Nothing.

332
00:27:07,201 --> 00:27:10,662
-I was always picked last for the teams.
-Okay.

333
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,582
Daphne, exit through the entrance.

334
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:16,543
Velma and I will enter
through the exit.

335
00:27:16,752 --> 00:27:19,421
And Shaggy and Scooby...

336
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,925
...do whatever you guys do.

337
00:27:39,358 --> 00:27:41,527
Look at this, huh, Scoob?

338
00:27:41,735 --> 00:27:44,154
It's like a medieval Sizzler.

339
00:27:44,321 --> 00:27:46,657
Pinch me, I'm in heaven...

340
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:50,327
-It's an expression, Scoob.
-Sorry.

341
00:28:06,927 --> 00:28:10,722
Velma, I never meant to...
Well, you know...

342
00:28:10,931 --> 00:28:13,642
-...pick you last.
-Don't worry about it.

343
00:28:14,184 --> 00:28:15,310
I know you.

344
00:28:15,769 --> 00:28:18,689
All you care about
are swimsuit models.

345
00:28:18,856 --> 00:28:24,236
Look, I'm a man of substance.
Dorky chicks like you turn me on too.

346
00:28:28,282 --> 00:28:30,659
That's a compliment.

347
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:00,606
Yes! Yes!

348
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:02,524
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

349
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,777
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, no!

350
00:29:08,197 --> 00:29:10,365
And now for our dinner show.

351
00:29:10,574 --> 00:29:12,117
What?

352
00:29:19,374 --> 00:29:21,043
Watch out!

353
00:29:25,005 --> 00:29:27,633
-I got a bad feeling about this.
-Me too.

354
00:29:27,841 --> 00:29:30,469
And now for the main course:

355
00:29:31,428 --> 00:29:33,055
You!

356
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,226
Feast on this.

357
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:48,111
Jinkies.

358
00:29:48,445 --> 00:29:51,865
They're moving toward us. Run!

359
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:56,328
-We're trapped.
-Quick, try the bookcase.

360
00:29:56,537 --> 00:30:00,249
-One of these has to open a passageway.
-Velma, this is a ride.

361
00:30:00,457 --> 00:30:02,251
You got a better plan?

362
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:09,049
What do we do?

363
00:30:09,216 --> 00:30:12,427
Do what we do best, Scoob:
Eat.

364
00:30:16,056 --> 00:30:17,057
It's plastic.

365
00:30:17,266 --> 00:30:19,643
So what? You drink out of a toilet.

366
00:30:20,644 --> 00:30:22,396
So do you.

367
00:30:23,564 --> 00:30:25,482
I'm not helpless.

368
00:30:25,649 --> 00:30:28,110
I am helpless. I'm gonna die!

369
00:30:48,255 --> 00:30:51,466
We made it, Scoob. We're alive!

370
00:30:56,263 --> 00:30:57,639
That was weird.

371
00:30:58,265 --> 00:30:59,600
Fred?

372
00:31:02,269 --> 00:31:03,770
Are you all right?

373
00:31:15,532 --> 00:31:17,451
The last book.

374
00:31:20,704 --> 00:31:22,873
I don't feel so good.

375
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:26,710
Reminds me of the time we tried to eat
that guy in the hot-dog costume.

376
00:31:27,628 --> 00:31:29,963
Looks like some kind of school.

377
00:31:30,214 --> 00:31:33,217
In a spooky castle ride? Fishy.

378
00:31:55,322 --> 00:31:57,783
Welcome to America.

379
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:00,702
I am using the language English.

380
00:32:00,869 --> 00:32:03,330
-Shaggy, look.
-Let's check it out.

381
00:32:08,544 --> 00:32:13,298
Oh, boy. Lights, camera, action,
huh, Scoob?

382
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:15,717
Now that you're a young adult...

383
00:32:15,926 --> 00:32:18,804
...you'll need to learn societal dos...

384
00:32:19,054 --> 00:32:20,806
...and don'ts.

385
00:32:21,223 --> 00:32:26,186
Interaction between young
people is polite and casual.

386
00:32:30,274 --> 00:32:31,567
Hey, sorry, bro.

387
00:32:31,817 --> 00:32:34,820
I will crush your bones into dust.

388
00:32:37,823 --> 00:32:41,618
Let's see how the situation
should be handled.

389
00:32:41,952 --> 00:32:47,708
Remember, today's young people
have a language all their own.

390
00:32:50,127 --> 00:32:51,628
Sorry, bro.

391
00:32:52,045 --> 00:32:54,923
No big whoop, dog.
Catch that new vid on the box?

392
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:58,177
True dat. I'm up to sniznuff
on all popular trends.

393
00:32:58,343 --> 00:32:59,761
Word.

394
00:33:01,221 --> 00:33:04,641
It seems to be a brainwashing
facility of some type.

395
00:33:04,808 --> 00:33:09,938
Wherever there's a brainwashing cult,
there's always a power-hungry leader.

396
00:33:10,105 --> 00:33:12,649
-The Papa Smurf figure.
-Mondevarious.

397
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,903
Then why would he have
invited us here?

398
00:34:05,035 --> 00:34:06,662
Jellybeans.

399
00:34:10,249 --> 00:34:12,876
I'll have whatever he's having.

400
00:34:17,923 --> 00:34:20,259
Are you challenging me?

401
00:34:21,677 --> 00:34:23,512
Maybe.

402
00:34:34,022 --> 00:34:36,775
Pull my finger. Too late.

403
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:45,617
-You're in trouble.
-Oh, boy.

404
00:34:59,047 --> 00:35:02,467
I'm not stopping
till your fur is singed off.

405
00:35:11,768 --> 00:35:14,980
We're here to solve a mystery.

406
00:35:15,147 --> 00:35:16,523
Yeah, Scoob.

407
00:35:22,112 --> 00:35:23,864
Let's get out of here.

408
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,950
Zoinks! Skedaddle!

409
00:35:35,542 --> 00:35:37,544
-I found a neat and scary clue.
-Us too.

410
00:35:37,753 --> 00:35:40,506
This is a brainwashing
facility for an evil cult.

411
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:43,926
Maybe this is the secret relic
thingy they worship.

412
00:35:44,301 --> 00:35:47,471
We'll all be relics if we don't
get out of here.

413
00:35:47,638 --> 00:35:49,056
I got a plan.

414
00:35:49,473 --> 00:35:52,726
What's that smell?

415
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,566
Sir, they found the Daemon Ritus.

416
00:36:00,567 --> 00:36:03,320
For your sake, they better not
have gone far.

417
00:36:05,155 --> 00:36:08,242
It is time to summon
the big muchachos.

418
00:36:09,952 --> 00:36:11,119
Like, oh, no!

419
00:36:39,189 --> 00:36:43,151
Mystery Inc. You all seem rather
cheery. Good news, I hope?

420
00:36:43,569 --> 00:36:45,028
Mr. Mononucleosis...

421
00:36:46,029 --> 00:36:49,575
-Yes?
-We have hit a clue smorgasbord.

422
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,871
We have three suspects
as to who's behind this evil hooty.

423
00:36:54,037 --> 00:36:57,749
N' Goo Tuana. He believes
your park's on enchanted ground.

424
00:36:57,916 --> 00:37:01,753
The voodoo man, who tricked me
into going to the castle.

425
00:37:02,045 --> 00:37:03,839
-And you.
-Me?

426
00:37:04,006 --> 00:37:06,758
Let's split up.
We'll meet in a half-hour.

427
00:37:06,925 --> 00:37:10,137
I'll interview employees to see
if they've noticed anything odd.

428
00:37:10,304 --> 00:37:13,348
I'll translate these inscriptions
Daphne found.

429
00:37:13,557 --> 00:37:15,934
I'll go research cults on the Net.

430
00:37:19,396 --> 00:37:21,064
I'm a suspect?

431
00:37:21,231 --> 00:37:24,943
Don't take it personally.
It's because you creep me out.

432
00:37:25,444 --> 00:37:27,112
I see.

433
00:37:28,405 --> 00:37:29,406
Fine.

434
00:37:47,591 --> 00:37:49,384
Jinkies.

435
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:12,491
Hey. Your friends ditch you?

436
00:38:12,658 --> 00:38:15,786
No, I always did the brainwork.

437
00:38:16,787 --> 00:38:18,247
What's this?

438
00:38:18,664 --> 00:38:20,916
I believe it's called
the Daemon Ritus.

439
00:38:21,124 --> 00:38:23,669
Daemon Ritus? What's it for?

440
00:38:23,919 --> 00:38:26,797
This describes
an old race of creatures.

441
00:38:26,964 --> 00:38:32,010
It's reminiscent of Pandaemonous texts,
so I can make some of it out.

442
00:38:32,177 --> 00:38:36,515
It looks like instructions
to some sort of secret ritual.

443
00:38:36,682 --> 00:38:38,350
It is fascinating.

444
00:38:38,517 --> 00:38:40,352
On the house. Nice sweater.

445
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:42,855
You really dig doing this, huh?

446
00:38:43,021 --> 00:38:45,065
Like, clues and stuff.

447
00:38:46,024 --> 00:38:47,150
Certainly.

448
00:38:47,317 --> 00:38:51,029
Really focusing on a mystery
reminds me of the old days.

449
00:38:53,198 --> 00:38:55,284
We were quite a crew back then.

450
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:58,704
That was the best time of my life.

451
00:38:58,871 --> 00:39:02,958
Shaggy and Scooby...
What goofballs!

452
00:39:03,166 --> 00:39:05,127
Kind of like they are today.

453
00:39:06,545 --> 00:39:08,130
And Daphne...

454
00:39:08,338 --> 00:39:13,051
So beautiful. She was the coolest girl
at Coolsville High.

455
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:16,221
Fred. He was so handsome.

456
00:39:16,388 --> 00:39:18,974
And he really knew how to accessorize.

457
00:39:19,349 --> 00:39:20,767
Sounds perfect.

458
00:39:20,934 --> 00:39:24,271
Yeah, but every family has one nut.

459
00:39:24,438 --> 00:39:26,815
Scrappy-Dappy-Doo!

460
00:39:27,149 --> 00:39:29,526
Ghosts don't stand a chance with me.

461
00:39:29,693 --> 00:39:32,863
Let me at 'em. I'll rack 'em.
I'll sock 'em.

462
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:36,366
For the thousandth time,
there's no such thing as ghosts.

463
00:39:36,533 --> 00:39:42,831
Sure there are. When I find them,
I'll give them a dose of puppy power!

464
00:39:43,874 --> 00:39:46,668
Oh, God. He's peeing on me.

465
00:39:52,716 --> 00:39:55,511
That little egomaniac
had flipped his lid.

466
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:58,680
Scrappy, I told you,
no urinating on Daphne.

467
00:39:58,847 --> 00:40:01,433
-It was an accident.
-You were marking your territory.

468
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:05,812
You don't have the scrote for this job.
Listen up, losers.

469
00:40:05,979 --> 00:40:09,691
The time has come to appoint me
your unquestioned leader.

470
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:13,362
Either that, or I'm out of here.

471
00:40:16,073 --> 00:40:20,953
What's the idea? You can't do
this to me. People adore me.

472
00:40:21,495 --> 00:40:25,249
I'm as cute as a Powerpuff Girl.
I'll get my own show.

473
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,544
Puppy power, huh?

474
00:40:28,836 --> 00:40:33,131
And he wasn't even a puppy.
He had a gland disorder.

475
00:40:47,604 --> 00:40:51,191
Help me! Help me!
Monsters! Monsters!

476
00:40:58,156 --> 00:41:01,326
This is the most embarrassing thing
you've done...

477
00:41:01,493 --> 00:41:05,831
...since you cleaned your beans
at Don Knotts' Christmas party.

478
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:08,125
How many times
do I have to tell you?

479
00:41:08,292 --> 00:41:13,380
There are no such things as ghouls,
ghosts, goblins or monsters.

480
00:41:13,714 --> 00:41:16,425
Now listen up. There is absolutely...

481
00:41:16,633 --> 00:41:20,971
...absolutely no such thing as...

482
00:41:23,932 --> 00:41:25,559
Monster!

483
00:41:29,521 --> 00:41:31,064
Fred!

484
00:41:33,275 --> 00:41:34,735
Scooby...

485
00:41:36,069 --> 00:41:38,447
Save Daphne.

486
00:41:44,036 --> 00:41:45,537
My glasses.

487
00:41:45,746 --> 00:41:48,415
I can't find my glasses.

488
00:41:50,751 --> 00:41:53,670
Help me find my glasses.

489
00:41:55,339 --> 00:41:57,257
Here they are.

490
00:41:58,175 --> 00:41:59,718
Thank you.

491
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:01,803
Nice mask.

492
00:42:02,304 --> 00:42:04,223
Bad breath.

493
00:42:07,851 --> 00:42:08,936
Here.

494
00:42:15,901 --> 00:42:17,486
Jinkies.

495
00:42:19,863 --> 00:42:21,323
Velma!

496
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:23,200
Come on!

497
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:30,040
Velma!

498
00:42:32,042 --> 00:42:35,045
This is, like, the opposite
of what I wanted to do today.

499
00:42:43,804 --> 00:42:45,305
Leave it!

500
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,315
Stand back, sir.

501
00:42:55,858 --> 00:42:57,359
I'll protect you.

502
00:43:02,739 --> 00:43:04,950
Mr. Mondevarious!

503
00:43:06,869 --> 00:43:08,662
Daphne, go!

504
00:43:10,956 --> 00:43:14,168
Scooby-Doo, where are you?

505
00:43:29,766 --> 00:43:34,271
Running suitcase.
Run suitcase. Run...

506
00:44:02,341 --> 00:44:04,092
Thank you.

507
00:44:05,552 --> 00:44:08,263
-Where's Scooby?
-I hope he's okay.

508
00:44:08,472 --> 00:44:11,683
-Right here. Scooby-Dooby-Doo!
-Hey, Scoob.

509
00:45:04,403 --> 00:45:09,241
I have a sinking feeling these dudes
aren't brainwashed cult members.

510
00:45:09,449 --> 00:45:13,829
What do they want with the students?
We need to follow them.

511
00:45:14,621 --> 00:45:18,083
-Say what?
-Defeat them and save Fred and Velma.

512
00:45:18,292 --> 00:45:23,672
Sort of like my plan: Get out of here,
let the creatures eat Fred and Velma.

513
00:45:23,881 --> 00:45:27,467
No way. Fred and Velma
always figured out everything.

514
00:45:27,676 --> 00:45:29,303
Now it's our turn.

515
00:45:29,469 --> 00:45:34,141
For the first time, they're
the damsels in distress, not me.

516
00:45:35,851 --> 00:45:37,352
-Help?
-Timber.

517
00:45:45,861 --> 00:45:51,283
-Okay, I'm calling for help.
-No. I got this. I got this.

518
00:45:55,078 --> 00:45:56,872
I don't got this.

519
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:11,261
-Coast Guard, Fitzgibbon.
-Hello, sir. We're on Spooky Island.

520
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:13,514
Our friends were...

521
00:46:14,515 --> 00:46:17,392
...kidnapped.
We need someone here right away.

522
00:46:17,601 --> 00:46:22,231
We do have a unit in the vicinity.
Can you meet them at the pier?

523
00:46:22,439 --> 00:46:24,858
All right, they'll be right there.

524
00:46:27,736 --> 00:46:30,906
"Our friends have been kidnapped."

525
00:47:01,353 --> 00:47:06,024
-Something messed up is happening.
-Is the Coast Guard here?

526
00:47:06,275 --> 00:47:09,862
What happened to the shattered windows
and busted walls?

527
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:11,905
Yo, Red. The ball.

528
00:47:15,784 --> 00:47:17,494
Let's go.

529
00:47:32,342 --> 00:47:35,095
Anyone else think this is strange?

530
00:47:36,763 --> 00:47:39,725
-Okay, we need to split up.
-Why?

531
00:47:39,933 --> 00:47:43,270
-We need to find Fred and Velma.
-I'll go this way.

532
00:47:43,478 --> 00:47:45,731
And we'll go with you.

533
00:47:46,773 --> 00:47:48,775
Come on, Scoob.

534
00:48:23,727 --> 00:48:24,853
Fred?

535
00:48:25,062 --> 00:48:29,733
Yo, the bitch was like, "What?"
And I was like, "Later on!"

536
00:48:31,652 --> 00:48:34,196
What up, dog? And...

537
00:48:34,404 --> 00:48:37,908
-...dog.
-Keeping it real.

538
00:48:38,158 --> 00:48:42,287
-What happened last night?
-We got beats like it was the lizz-nizz.

539
00:48:42,496 --> 00:48:45,415
-You know what I'm saying, G?
-No.

540
00:48:47,417 --> 00:48:49,545
You hear that?

541
00:48:57,135 --> 00:48:59,054
Get the dog.

542
00:49:02,182 --> 00:49:05,644
-Damsel in distress.
-Let go of me. Help!

543
00:49:07,521 --> 00:49:10,607
Hurry, get the door!

544
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:21,535
-Why is Fred in a bad mood?
-He's not in a bad mood, Scoob...

545
00:49:21,743 --> 00:49:23,996
...he's a monster.

546
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:37,050
-Shaggy, bikes!
-I know, "yikes!"

547
00:49:37,259 --> 00:49:39,303
No, bikes!

548
00:49:39,678 --> 00:49:41,138
Scoob!

549
00:50:00,866 --> 00:50:02,951
Shaggy, look out!

550
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:07,664
I just saw my friend Beth Ann.
Something's wrong with her eyes.

551
00:50:07,873 --> 00:50:09,791
Like, hop on!

552
00:50:22,638 --> 00:50:25,015
Like, what a drag!

553
00:50:37,194 --> 00:50:38,362
Like, duck!

554
00:51:00,133 --> 00:51:01,927
-Yes!
-That was great!

555
00:51:02,135 --> 00:51:06,557
-Are you all right? You were great.
-You too.

556
00:51:08,684 --> 00:51:13,105
-Scooby, what are you doing, man?
-Mary Jane is a man in a mask.

557
00:51:13,313 --> 00:51:16,275
-Mary Jane is a man in a mask?
-Scooby.

558
00:51:16,483 --> 00:51:19,528
What are you doing, man?
Step off, Scoob.

559
00:51:19,736 --> 00:51:21,738
Shaggy, you're whipped.

560
00:51:21,989 --> 00:51:25,784
I'm whipped? Yeah?
Why don't you say that to my face?

561
00:51:25,993 --> 00:51:28,620
Okay, I will.
Your mommy eats cat poop!

562
00:51:28,829 --> 00:51:31,582
No, Scooby-Doo,
your mom eats cat poop!

563
00:51:33,417 --> 00:51:36,503
Bring it.
You want a piece of the Shagster?

564
00:51:36,712 --> 00:51:39,298
-Feel the pain, Scoob.
-Okay.

565
00:51:39,506 --> 00:51:41,550
Come on! Two shots! Two shots!

566
00:51:41,758 --> 00:51:45,762
Me and you, me and you again.
I'll give you some right now, buddy.

567
00:51:48,765 --> 00:51:50,225
Scoob!

568
00:51:51,185 --> 00:51:54,855
I gotta save him.
You stay here, I'll be right back.

569
00:51:55,063 --> 00:51:57,024
No, Shaggy.

570
00:51:57,357 --> 00:51:59,860
I mean, it's too dangerous.

571
00:52:00,068 --> 00:52:04,114
I've got to. He's, like, my best pal.

572
00:52:05,365 --> 00:52:07,326
Friends don't quit.

573
00:52:19,463 --> 00:52:20,964
Scoob?

574
00:52:24,843 --> 00:52:26,678
Scooby-Doo...

575
00:52:27,346 --> 00:52:29,890
...where are you?

576
00:52:30,891 --> 00:52:32,601
Scoob?

577
00:53:05,425 --> 00:53:08,387
Shaggy. Shaggy.

578
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:12,599
Shaggy!

579
00:53:14,768 --> 00:53:16,270
Velma.

580
00:53:17,896 --> 00:53:19,815
I'll save you.

581
00:53:27,614 --> 00:53:30,742
Thanks, Shaggy.
Boy, am I glad to see you.

582
00:53:30,951 --> 00:53:34,746
Let me go so I can return to my body.
Get out of here...

583
00:53:34,955 --> 00:53:38,125
...before they steal
your protoplasm too.

584
00:53:38,458 --> 00:53:41,378
I always knew you were a hero, Shaggy.

585
00:53:43,422 --> 00:53:45,132
Jinkies!

586
00:54:17,956 --> 00:54:20,125
-Hey, buddy.
-Shaggy!

587
00:54:20,292 --> 00:54:26,798
Someone must have spiked my root beer
last night. Talk me down, man.

588
00:54:27,049 --> 00:54:30,260
Fred, you're a frigging
protoplasmic head.

589
00:54:32,679 --> 00:54:34,223
I know.

590
00:54:34,681 --> 00:54:38,352
But I'm still the best-Iooking
protoplasmic head here.

591
00:54:41,271 --> 00:54:42,523
How do you drive this?

592
00:54:42,731 --> 00:54:46,568
The Darkopalypse's upon us.
Get what you need for the ceremony.

593
00:54:46,777 --> 00:54:49,404
On your right. Your left.

594
00:54:50,447 --> 00:54:52,866
I'm coming, good-Iooking!

595
00:54:56,245 --> 00:55:00,499
-Thank you, you've saved me.
-Sorry, I'm looking for my friends.

596
00:55:00,707 --> 00:55:02,125
But...

597
00:55:07,089 --> 00:55:10,384
Put me back, Shaggy.
I'll figure a way out myself.

598
00:55:10,843 --> 00:55:12,594
-Like, how?
-I don't know.

599
00:55:12,803 --> 00:55:16,765
I'll use my tongue as an oar
and swim to the edge.

600
00:55:16,974 --> 00:55:18,308
Sorry.

601
00:55:33,949 --> 00:55:36,326
Yo, yo, you, yo.

602
00:55:43,834 --> 00:55:45,502
What the...?

603
00:56:01,351 --> 00:56:04,062
You could use a little sunlight.

604
00:56:17,451 --> 00:56:19,745
That's one part of the mystery solved.

605
00:56:19,953 --> 00:56:23,498
The creatures need our bodies
to survive in sunlight.

606
00:56:24,249 --> 00:56:26,210
Like a human suit.

607
00:56:26,418 --> 00:56:29,463
SPF 1,000,000.

608
00:56:30,422 --> 00:56:33,884
But what are they doing here
in the first place?

609
00:56:35,928 --> 00:56:38,222
Daphne, you okay?

610
00:56:39,139 --> 00:56:40,599
Yeah.

611
00:56:40,807 --> 00:56:43,977
-But I'm not Daphne!
-Fred?

612
00:56:50,567 --> 00:56:54,613
I couldn't get to my body.
I didn't know where else to go.

613
00:56:54,821 --> 00:56:58,116
It's not easy to steer
when you're pure spirit.

614
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:04,331
I can look at myself naked.

615
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:05,874
Oh, brother.

616
00:57:14,508 --> 00:57:16,927
-Get your hands off me.
-Daphne?

617
00:57:17,135 --> 00:57:21,723
-He planned this somehow, didn't he?
-Hey, good-Iooking.

618
00:57:23,141 --> 00:57:24,977
Fred, you egocentric...

619
00:57:25,185 --> 00:57:28,605
-Please tell me you guys are you.
-Fred keeps touching me.

620
00:57:28,814 --> 00:57:32,192
Makes you nostalgic
for the homicidal creatures.

621
00:57:32,401 --> 00:57:35,153
I stole this. I hope it helps.

622
00:57:35,362 --> 00:57:37,614
The Daemon Ritus.

623
00:57:43,704 --> 00:57:46,957
-I'm me again.
-Yippee for you.

624
00:57:47,165 --> 00:57:50,669
Man, like, why am I wearing a dress?

625
00:57:50,878 --> 00:57:54,840
Everyone remain calm.
Velma, what the heck's going on?

626
00:57:55,048 --> 00:57:56,884
If I am correct...

627
00:57:57,092 --> 00:58:01,638
...due to the instability of protoplasm
in the proximity of the Daemon Ritus...

628
00:58:01,889 --> 00:58:05,976
...we're going to continue
randomly changing bodies until...

629
00:58:07,144 --> 00:58:08,145
Jinkies!

630
00:58:09,605 --> 00:58:12,774
...until the protoplasm realigns
with the correct bodies.

631
00:58:12,983 --> 00:58:14,735
I'm Fred again!

632
00:58:14,943 --> 00:58:19,489
Daph, what's wrong with you?
Don't you ever eat?

633
00:58:25,412 --> 00:58:26,371
I'm me.

634
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:28,540
-I'm back.
-Like, me too.

635
00:58:28,749 --> 00:58:30,542
Told you so.

636
00:58:32,002 --> 00:58:34,171
-Oh, no.
-Let's go.

637
00:58:37,799 --> 00:58:40,469
I guess that was the wrong ingredient.

638
00:58:41,094 --> 00:58:42,471
Wait.

639
00:58:43,013 --> 00:58:45,224
I know how to handle this guy.

640
00:58:45,432 --> 00:58:48,018
Hey, you! What're you doing?

641
00:58:48,268 --> 00:58:50,896
Yes. That is masterful.

642
00:58:51,104 --> 00:58:55,400
I'm doing a voodoo ritual.
I need to get the right ingredients.

643
00:58:55,609 --> 00:58:59,821
The only way to protect myself is
by blessing this dead Arnouki beast.

644
00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:04,409
They're about to perform
their evil Darkopalypse ritual.

645
00:59:04,576 --> 00:59:06,787
-Darkopalypse ritual?
-Right.

646
00:59:06,995 --> 00:59:10,666
-That's what the ancient text describes.
-Don't open that!

647
00:59:10,874 --> 00:59:14,586
They use the protoplasm
in the vat as an energy source.

648
00:59:15,295 --> 00:59:20,092
And the leader needs to absorb a purely
good soul to complete the ritual.

649
00:59:20,259 --> 00:59:23,303
Legend has it,
once the ritual is performed...

650
00:59:23,470 --> 00:59:27,349
...the creatures will rule on Earth
for 10,000 years.

651
00:59:27,516 --> 00:59:31,061
That's why I have this in my house.
To protect myself.

652
00:59:31,228 --> 00:59:33,689
You have another one of those?

653
00:59:33,856 --> 00:59:38,318
Those creatures are taking over
the world? That is so mean.

654
00:59:38,485 --> 00:59:43,240
They can't do the ritual without a pure
human soul. Where will they get one?

655
00:59:43,407 --> 00:59:46,577
I didn't say human.

656
00:59:46,743 --> 00:59:48,370
Oh, boy.

657
01:00:06,221 --> 01:00:08,891
Hello, puppy.

658
01:00:09,057 --> 01:00:12,352
If the person behind all this
needs Scooby-Doo...

659
01:00:12,519 --> 01:00:15,606
Then that person is the one
who brought Scooby here.

660
01:00:20,194 --> 01:00:25,032
Scoobert. How are you, my friend?
Sit down, please.

661
01:00:25,199 --> 01:00:26,700
Okay.

662
01:00:28,869 --> 01:00:30,871
Scooby Snack?

663
01:00:31,038 --> 01:00:32,998
Maybe one.

664
01:00:37,336 --> 01:00:39,796
We'll need some more of those.

665
01:00:41,048 --> 01:00:43,258
That's me!

666
01:00:43,425 --> 01:00:47,846
It certainly is.
And that's because...why?

667
01:00:48,013 --> 01:00:51,475
We love you, Scooby-Doo.

668
01:00:51,683 --> 01:00:55,729
Unlike that alleged friend
of yours, Shaggy.

669
01:00:56,563 --> 01:01:02,277
He wouldn't believe you about
that nasty girl Mary Jane, would he?

670
01:01:02,903 --> 01:01:04,446
No.

671
01:01:05,239 --> 01:01:08,075
But I believe you, my friend.

672
01:01:08,242 --> 01:01:13,205
And that's why I've got
a very important job for you.

673
01:01:13,372 --> 01:01:14,915
What's that?

674
01:01:15,082 --> 01:01:18,877
That's a cat with a bobbing head.
Please don't touch it.

675
01:01:20,879 --> 01:01:23,048
I would like you...

676
01:01:23,215 --> 01:01:27,219
...to be a sacrifice.

677
01:01:27,427 --> 01:01:29,805
A sacrifice?

678
01:01:33,475 --> 01:01:36,728
If Mondorajagaga wanted Scooby,
why'd he invite the rest of us?

679
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:40,107
It doesn't matter.
We gotta, like, go save Scoob.

680
01:01:40,274 --> 01:01:44,027
Our area of expertise is nut jobs
in Halloween costumes.

681
01:01:44,194 --> 01:01:46,363
We're supposed to be heroes, man.

682
01:01:47,906 --> 01:01:51,159
So I'm gonna do what I always do:

683
01:01:51,326 --> 01:01:56,081
I'm gonna eat myself a Scooby Snack,
and I'm gonna save my best pal.

684
01:01:58,250 --> 01:02:00,043
Velmster?

685
01:02:00,419 --> 01:02:05,507
You think I'm gonna fall for that?
Giving me my own nickname?

686
01:02:06,091 --> 01:02:09,052
Trying to make me feel like...

687
01:02:09,261 --> 01:02:11,763
...part of the gang?

688
01:02:14,099 --> 01:02:16,101
We could make a plan.

689
01:02:16,268 --> 01:02:20,397
What can I do? The only thing
I'm good for is getting caught.

690
01:02:20,564 --> 01:02:23,025
But you never let that
stop you before.

691
01:02:23,192 --> 01:02:28,155
And if that's not a true hero,
then I don't know what is.

692
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:40,167
Let's get jinkie with it.

693
01:03:11,823 --> 01:03:16,662
Okay, so we use the pulleys
to tip over the vat.

694
01:03:16,828 --> 01:03:20,582
Daphne will open the air vents
and release the disco skull.

695
01:03:20,749 --> 01:03:22,793
The light will refract off the skull...

696
01:03:23,001 --> 01:03:28,131
The creatures will explode, I'll find
Scoob, and we'll have saved the world.

697
01:03:29,007 --> 01:03:31,802
Oh, no. The ritual's beginning.

698
01:03:31,969 --> 01:03:34,471
Quick. Attach this to the vat.

699
01:03:43,272 --> 01:03:45,440
We're here to save you.

700
01:03:45,607 --> 01:03:47,234
Shaggy, faster.

701
01:03:47,693 --> 01:03:49,152
All systems go.

702
01:03:49,736 --> 01:03:51,196
Wait, no!

703
01:03:51,363 --> 01:03:53,365
Mystery Inc. rides again.

704
01:04:23,645 --> 01:04:26,648
Quick, hide the Daemon Ritus.

705
01:04:38,243 --> 01:04:41,163
Would you like another Scooby Snack?

706
01:04:41,705 --> 01:04:43,123
Okay.

707
01:04:43,290 --> 01:04:45,292
Scooby-Doo!

708
01:06:02,244 --> 01:06:05,581
Yo, yo, yo. Yo, homedogs.

709
01:06:05,747 --> 01:06:08,083
You forgot the next part
of the dance...

710
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:11,503
...where we do the Electric Slide,
you know...

711
01:06:22,264 --> 01:06:24,474
Hurry up, Velma.

712
01:06:25,684 --> 01:06:29,646
Welcome to my little
end-of-the-world party.

713
01:06:29,855 --> 01:06:33,150
I've waited a long time
for this moment.

714
01:06:33,317 --> 01:06:37,863
Thank you for returning
the ultimate party favor:

715
01:06:38,030 --> 01:06:40,866
The Daemon Ritus.

716
01:06:42,659 --> 01:06:47,331
And now, behold the sacrifice.

717
01:06:48,707 --> 01:06:52,002
Thank you. Thank you.

718
01:06:52,169 --> 01:06:54,671
Hello, thank you.

719
01:06:56,757 --> 01:06:58,759
Thank you. Shaggy?

720
01:07:01,970 --> 01:07:04,973
Let's run for it.
We gotta get out of here.

721
01:07:05,349 --> 01:07:08,143
-I'm a sacrifice. Hello.
-A sacrifice?

722
01:07:08,310 --> 01:07:12,147
Dude, that's not a good thing, Scoob.

723
01:07:16,568 --> 01:07:18,445
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

724
01:07:18,612 --> 01:07:23,408
And I'm sorry I haven't been
a very good friend since we got here.

725
01:07:23,575 --> 01:07:26,703
-But you gotta trust me now.
-You don't trust me.

726
01:07:26,870 --> 01:07:32,292
I do trust you.
Now, look. Who's your best buddy?

727
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:34,878
-Shaggy.
-Right.

728
01:07:35,045 --> 01:07:37,047
And who's my best buddy?

729
01:07:37,631 --> 01:07:40,008
-Scooby-Doo?
-That's right.

730
01:07:40,175 --> 01:07:45,430
You are. And we're like two trippy peas
in a far-out pod, man.

731
01:07:45,973 --> 01:07:49,393
Best buddies trust each other.
Let's do what we do best.

732
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:53,939
Let's run out of here screaming
in fear like two lunatics, okay?

733
01:07:54,106 --> 01:07:57,192
On the count of...
Let's make it five. One.

734
01:07:58,235 --> 01:07:59,820
Two.

735
01:08:07,452 --> 01:08:09,204
Hey, look at me!

736
01:08:20,591 --> 01:08:23,218
The moment is at hand.

737
01:08:23,385 --> 01:08:28,807
Through the Daemon Ritus,
I shall absorb the energy source.

738
01:08:37,733 --> 01:08:41,737
And now, to complete
the transformation...

739
01:08:41,904 --> 01:08:45,908
...I shall absorb the pure one.

740
01:08:47,159 --> 01:08:51,496
Ultimate power shall be mine!

741
01:08:51,663 --> 01:08:54,458
Nobody absorbs my pal!

742
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:09,765
Come on!

743
01:09:12,184 --> 01:09:14,728
I'm free!

744
01:09:16,021 --> 01:09:17,397
Look at me!

745
01:09:17,564 --> 01:09:19,525
Get him!

746
01:09:22,069 --> 01:09:23,862
Let's get the Daemon Ritus.

747
01:09:24,029 --> 01:09:26,448
Get off my pincer!

748
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:36,708
Cowabunga!

749
01:09:42,548 --> 01:09:46,802
Look, Velms. A man in a mask.

750
01:09:51,598 --> 01:09:56,311
We love you, Scooby-Doo. We love you.

751
01:09:56,812 --> 01:10:00,148
That alleged friend of yours, Shaggy.

752
01:10:00,315 --> 01:10:02,067
I shall absorb...

753
01:10:05,445 --> 01:10:09,491
Puppy power! I've outsmarted...

754
01:10:12,244 --> 01:10:13,787
Scrappy-Doo.

755
01:10:13,954 --> 01:10:17,833
Correction.
The new, improved Scrappy.

756
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:24,214
Because l, Scrappy-Dappy-Doo,
have absorbed enough energy...

757
01:10:24,381 --> 01:10:29,887
...to rule the world
with my all-powerful army!

758
01:10:30,846 --> 01:10:35,893
And I've brought you here,
puny, pathetic Mystery Inc...

759
01:10:36,059 --> 01:10:40,022
...to witness my moment of triumph.

760
01:10:40,189 --> 01:10:45,152
All I need to complete
my transformation is Scooby-Doo.

761
01:10:46,820 --> 01:10:50,115
Me? Don't you mean Melvin Doo?

762
01:10:50,282 --> 01:10:51,867
Seize them!

763
01:10:52,034 --> 01:10:54,953
Like, let's get out of here!

764
01:10:56,205 --> 01:10:58,707
Take that, pretty boy!

765
01:11:14,681 --> 01:11:17,226
This is totally un-groovy, Scoob.

766
01:11:17,392 --> 01:11:21,438
Scooby-Doo, where are you?

767
01:11:37,538 --> 01:11:42,000
Yield to my puppy power!

768
01:11:42,626 --> 01:11:45,170
-We gotta tip over the protoplasm vat.
-How?

769
01:11:45,337 --> 01:11:47,923
The pincer. Come on.

770
01:11:52,678 --> 01:11:57,140
You all need to step back,
because Fredster's got his groove on.

771
01:12:15,868 --> 01:12:20,205
Got you! You look
so much bigger on TV.

772
01:12:34,428 --> 01:12:36,388
You're done!

773
01:12:46,273 --> 01:12:49,318
Come back here, you lazy beatnik.

774
01:12:56,366 --> 01:12:58,535
-Crud.
-Told you so.

775
01:13:04,416 --> 01:13:06,627
Like, wow!

776
01:13:07,002 --> 01:13:09,630
Give me the dog!

777
01:13:11,715 --> 01:13:14,510
Down! Sit! Bad Scrappy!

778
01:13:23,810 --> 01:13:28,232
Let's finish this puppy! Now!

779
01:13:28,398 --> 01:13:29,983
Not again.

780
01:13:30,692 --> 01:13:33,362
Captured again, seorita?

781
01:13:33,529 --> 01:13:37,366
Not this time!

782
01:13:55,676 --> 01:13:58,428
-Now who's the damsel in distress?
-Me?

783
01:13:58,929 --> 01:14:00,347
Straight up.

784
01:14:36,633 --> 01:14:39,845
Mystery Inc., this ain't over!

785
01:14:40,179 --> 01:14:43,098
Not by a long shot!

786
01:14:44,308 --> 01:14:47,811
I'll rock you and sock you...

787
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:50,480
...and crush you like...

788
01:14:51,398 --> 01:14:53,734
-Like, dude?
-What?

789
01:14:53,901 --> 01:14:57,321
You're a bad puppy!

790
01:15:11,627 --> 01:15:16,673
Come on, I can still take you.
Put them up, you mangy mutt.

791
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:19,510
Is that all you got?

792
01:15:36,652 --> 01:15:39,613
-We did it!
-Yes, we did.

793
01:15:51,083 --> 01:15:53,293
Cut it out.

794
01:16:08,517 --> 01:16:11,603
Mr. Mondevarious, is that you?

795
01:16:11,770 --> 01:16:14,898
Thank goodness!
Thank you! Thank you!

796
01:16:15,065 --> 01:16:17,192
Velma! Thank you!

797
01:16:22,281 --> 01:16:25,617
You're fogging up my glasses.

798
01:16:28,787 --> 01:16:31,123
Two years ago, that little pest...

799
01:16:31,290 --> 01:16:34,459
...turns up at a casting session
for our evil elves.

800
01:16:34,626 --> 01:16:36,879
Next thing I know,
I'm stuck in a hole...

801
01:16:37,045 --> 01:16:41,049
...and he's cavorting about
in a mechanical version of me.

802
01:16:41,216 --> 01:16:45,053
But look, thank you so much.

803
01:16:46,471 --> 01:16:50,475
What a delight. Fantastic!
Fantastic!

804
01:17:01,069 --> 01:17:02,738
I love you, Shaggy.

805
01:17:02,905 --> 01:17:04,823
I love you too, Scoob.

806
01:17:04,990 --> 01:17:07,743
Now get off me, buddy.

807
01:17:11,496 --> 01:17:14,917
Thanks. You saved my life.

808
01:17:15,083 --> 01:17:17,211
Like, no problem.

809
01:17:24,927 --> 01:17:27,346
And thank you, Scooby-Doo.

810
01:17:27,763 --> 01:17:32,142
-My little schmookem-wookem.
-Shucks.

811
01:17:57,084 --> 01:18:00,754
Fred, can you tell us
how you solved the case?

812
01:18:00,921 --> 01:18:05,509
It all started when I was giving
a speech on my new book and...

813
01:18:09,388 --> 01:18:12,933
And I think the Velmster
should take it from here.

814
01:18:14,893 --> 01:18:16,478
Go.

815
01:18:20,232 --> 01:18:24,486
Through the combined
intuitive powers of Mystery Inc...

816
01:18:24,653 --> 01:18:30,951
...we've discovered the real villain
is, in fact, Scrappy Cornelius Doo...

817
01:18:31,118 --> 01:18:33,954
...who sadly was corrupted
by the power of the Daemon Ritus.

818
01:18:34,162 --> 01:18:37,416
Get over it!
So I got a little cranky.

819
01:18:37,583 --> 01:18:41,920
It's no reason to freak out like a jerk
and try to kill all of humanity.

820
01:18:42,087 --> 01:18:45,716
I would've gotten away with it too,
if not for you meddling sons of...

821
01:18:45,924 --> 01:18:48,343
Now that Mystery Inc.
is back together...

822
01:18:48,510 --> 01:18:51,763
...any comment on the Mud Bog Ghoul
who's been terrorizing London?

823
01:18:51,930 --> 01:18:54,641
Whatever the case,
Mystery Inc. will be there.

824
01:18:54,808 --> 01:18:56,351
Solving mysteries, man.

825
01:18:56,643 --> 01:19:00,898
-Righting wrongs.
-Looking for clues and kicking butt.

826
01:19:18,832 --> 01:19:20,959
How groovy is this, man?

827
01:19:21,126 --> 01:19:25,339
Spooky Island finally came through
with its all-you-can-eat deal.

828
01:19:25,589 --> 01:19:31,053
And there's nobody I'd rather
gorge myself with than you, Scooby-Doo.

829
01:19:31,220 --> 01:19:34,348
-My best friend.
-You're my best friend, buddy.

830
01:19:34,681 --> 01:19:38,852
You're beautiful like a beautiful
piece of pizza.

831
01:19:43,774 --> 01:19:47,778
Zoinks! Them peppers is, like, hot.

832
01:19:48,278 --> 01:19:51,448
-Wimp.
-Wimp? You think you can handle it?

833
01:19:51,615 --> 01:19:55,911
Why don't you put your mouth
where your mouth is?

834
01:19:59,331 --> 01:20:00,832
Okay.

835
01:20:10,425 --> 01:20:14,471
Scooby-Doo, you feeling okay?

836
01:20:30,654 --> 01:20:32,155
Here you go, dude.

837
01:20:41,206 --> 01:20:44,001
-Like, how'd that taste, man?
-Delicious.

838
01:20:44,168 --> 01:20:46,587
Well, let's get two more.

839
01:20:52,009 --> 01:20:57,598
On the count of three.
One, two, three!
