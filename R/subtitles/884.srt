1
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:53,761
"Spot-checks on...

2
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:59,100
Speaking of the merger,
are you rich and famous yet?

3
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:02,270
Congratulations in advance on your promotion.

4
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,021
Arthur."

5
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,777
Dad, you got a e-mail.

6
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,990
I'm not a pain in the ass, I'm being a lawyer.

7
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:15,783
There's a difference.

8
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:20,079
No more computer games, Matt,
it's time for school. Eliza, where are you?

9
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:22,081
You got a e-mail, Dad.

10
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:26,669
- Matt's got toothpaste all over!
- Matt.

11
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:31,007
If you can't get them ready
for school, don't say you'll take care of it.

12
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:33,634
- You're welcome.
- Yeah, I'm here.

13
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,345
- And Liza needs a jacket.
- I know. Liza!

14
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,473
A jacket doesn't go, Dad.

15
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,391
Matt, put on a sweatshirt.

16
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,602
That's for girls, a white sweatshirt.

17
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,564
- Since when? Liza!
- Dad, leave me alone.

18
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:48,900
Liza, I am the father.

19
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:53,112
When your father says put your jacket on,
you put your jacket on.

20
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,657
Ariel doesn't have a father.
She has two mothers.

21
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,326
That's interesting.

22
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:02,163
He's in a hotel with his secretary
patched in from New York...

23
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:05,291
...while I'm brushing the Cheerios
out of my file folders.

24
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,542
It's insanity.

25
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,169
- Put your jacket on.
- No.

26
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:10,129
- Put this on, sweetie.
- No.

27
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,298
You can take it off when you get to school.

28
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,467
When I say listen to Mom, listen to Mom.

29
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,552
- Matt, did you pee?
- Yes.

30
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,805
I don't know why you said you'd help me out...

31
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,140
...on a day like today, with your promotion.

32
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,184
What's dad wearing around his neck?

33
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:25,144
You don't know what this is?

34
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,687
This is a tie.

35
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,314
Daddy's getting a promotion.

36
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,775
- Dad, you got a e-mail.
- Thanks. Let's go.

37
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:32,360
We're late.

38
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,660
Did you call about those Disneyland tickets?

39
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:44,831
- With everything I have to do today?
- It's just one call.

40
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,082
Who are they for?

41
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,502
Mohammed Jafar.
He's foreman of the Malaysian plant.

42
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,130
You're the one person I know
who sucks up to the people below you.

43
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,884
Matt, don't kick the seat.

44
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,720
- What's that on your tie?
- Toothpaste. Let's go.

45
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,807
The one day you wear a tie,
it shouldn't look like a bib.

46
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,749
Hi, Cindy, what's up?

47
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:32,253
Garvin came by the office this morning?

48
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:34,130
About the promotion?

49
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:37,258
Matt, will you stop that?

50
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:41,679
He was surprised I was late?
What does that mean?

51
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:45,182
Did he say it in passing,
or like he really meant it?

52
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:53,941
I wonder why Garvin's coming by
the office at 8:00 in the morning.

53
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,484
To congratulate you.

54
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,945
That's not like him.
He treats everyone like dirt.

55
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,197
Except the top guys.

56
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:05,786
Yeah. Except the top guys.

57
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:10,124
When this merger with Conley-White
goes through...

58
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:14,211
...and they spin off our division,
we're gonna be rich, Susan.

59
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:19,091
- We're already rich, if you ask me.
- No, I mean-- I mean really rich.

60
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,969
My grandmother used to have this expression:

61
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,140
"Don't climb up there too close to God,
He might shake the tree."

62
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,236
Tom!

63
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,489
Thanks for this morning.

64
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,621
Go! Go, go, go!

65
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,143
- Smaller, faster, cheaper, better.
- Yeah, heh.

66
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,711
Remember the first ones,
the way you lugged it around?

67
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:17,358
People were amazed. It was like
showing a Polaroid to a bushman.

68
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:20,611
Now, if it's bigger than a credit card,
it's too inconvenient.

69
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,279
Keeps you on your toes.

70
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:25,032
Eddie, it's Tom. Cindy said you called.

71
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:26,742
Sure, I can hang on.

72
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,620
How's the job search?

73
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,708
28 years with IBM.
Did I tell you what they told me?

74
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,752
I was "surplussed."
Ever hear that word?

75
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,380
What's going on down there, Eddie?

76
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:41,632
What? That's crazy.

77
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,634
They should've said, "sodomized."

78
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:48,639
They're not gonna sell the Austin plant.
That's just a rumor floating around.

79
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:52,893
You don't see it coming. You go along,
and then one day there's no room.

80
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,895
Boom. No more room for you.

81
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:57,148
Smaller, faster, cheaper, better.

82
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,066
I won't mention names, I'm on a cellular.

83
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:02,069
No names. I'm just telling you,
it's not true. It's a rumor.

84
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:06,157
I was making 150 a year.
Big money. Boom.

85
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,492
It's probably what you make, huh?
One fifty?

86
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,994
Eddie, hang on.

87
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:12,163
Why don't you call Cindy...

88
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:16,042
...make an appointment?
I'll see if I can help out.

89
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,170
Eddie, they are not gonna sell Austin.

90
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:22,256
If I'm telling you,
who else are you gonna believe?

91
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:25,092
Cindy. Pretty name.

92
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:28,804
Used to have fun with the girls.
Nowadays she probably wants your job.

93
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,471
Good morning.

94
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,474
- What did Garvin say? Want me to come up?
- He didn't say.

95
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:14,975
- He growled.
- Yeah.

96
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,394
He was flirting. Did you get Arthur?

97
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,355
He's standing by on the DVL.

98
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:21,649
Lunch with Conley-White got pushed up to noon.

99
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:25,444
We'll probably have those sandwiches
with the crusts cut off.

100
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,197
Their jaws were wired shut
at the same prep school.

101
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:32,368
- The merger's still going through?
- Why, you heard something?

102
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:35,371
No. Just, I....

103
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,248
What's that on your tie?

104
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,167
Garvin didn't say anything about my promotion?

105
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:41,919
I thought you'd be in early today.

106
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,630
People from "Father of the Year" haven't called?

107
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,883
- No.
- That's a joke.

108
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:54,098
- Five seconds to Malaysia.
- Want me to close your door?

109
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:57,226
- Do I ever ask you to close my door?
- Never.

110
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:00,855
Malaysian video linkup.

111
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:05,651
- Tom. You look, uh, frighteningly awake.
- What's wrong with Arcamax?

112
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:10,322
The drives are very slow. We're
getting seek times in the 140-160 range.

113
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:14,034
140 isn't a sexy CD player anymore.
140 is what everyone else has got.

114
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,662
My guys think there's a compatibility problem...

115
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,456
...between the controller chip
and the driver's software.

116
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,584
If it's the chip, that puts us back a year.

117
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:26,463
The screen flickers. The current cuts
in and out. It's a design problem.

118
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:29,717
What do you mean? Every laptop
in the world's got the same design.

119
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:33,304
I sent you out some drives.
You should get them today.

120
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,557
This is bad, Arthur.
How could this happen?

121
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,893
Gonna bury it until the merger?

122
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,062
Don't you say anything.
Does anyone else know?

123
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,316
I'm a grave. What, are you kidding, Tom?

124
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:49,403
I still think, really, that Arcamax
will be a major, major hit.

125
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,530
I'll talk to you when I see the drives.

126
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:55,409
- Tom, did you get the macadamia nuts?
- Good night, Arthur.

127
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,161
They are so good.

128
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,497
He's off the phone. I gotta go.

129
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,084
Do you know a Meredith Johnson?

130
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,962
- Meredith? Yeah, years ago.
- She wanted to see you.

131
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,422
She's here for the lunch.

132
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,841
The entire company invited up for this lunch?

133
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,385
Garvin brought the Operations Group up with him.

134
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,512
Meredith is in Operations?

135
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,849
What should I tell her?
Bad day, in-laws in town?

136
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:22,937
I'm gonna see Lewyn about the 900s.
Get that worried look off your face.

137
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,856
If there was bad news,
Garvin would've sent Phil Blackburn.

138
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:36,200
Hey, Phil.
You're not coming to see me, are you?

139
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:40,037
- No. Why?
- Nothing. How are you?

140
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:43,249
Jesus. How are you, Tom?
You look all beat up.

141
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,458
I do?

142
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:48,379
You're letting it get to you. Don't.
It's Garvin, you can't take it personally.

143
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,130
Take what personally?

144
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,299
Look, maybe it's just a rumor.

145
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:53,717
What's a rumor?

146
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:57,304
I don't wanna spread rumors.
That's how these things get started.

147
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,640
- Talking about Austin?
- Who said Austin?

148
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:00,891
What am I missing?

149
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:04,311
I can't believe he didn't tell you.
He's so perverse.

150
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:05,980
Didn't tell me what?

151
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:10,859
- So how's Susan?
- Susan's good.

152
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,987
- How's Lonnie?
- Great.

153
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:18,117
- Do you know she got tenure? Ha, ha.
- That's great.

154
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,205
Well, here's my stop.

155
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,502
I tried to explain to Garvin.

156
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,879
You know what he's like.
He's like a child.

157
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:34,675
Fuck your feelings if they
get in the way of his big surprise.

158
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:38,345
- What surprise?
- Rumor is you're getting passed over.

159
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:43,434
- I'm not getting the VP job?
- That's the rumor. All I can tell you.

160
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,102
Rumors are always true.

161
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,603
Garvin hasn't said anything?

162
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,732
Came by the office. I was late,
Susan had a conference.

163
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,359
- You were late? Today?
- What brings you to Seattle?

164
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:56,822
- Good to see you again. Ha-ha-ha.
- Nice to see you, Mr. Blackburn.

165
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,245
Somebody tells Garvin I was talking to you, phew.

166
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:04,955
You know how he is about leaks.

167
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,374
Now it's a leak?
I thought it was a rumor.

168
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:11,211
It was different when we were in the
Valley together. I could watch your back.

169
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,756
Who gets the job, Stephanie Kaplan?

170
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,133
Rumor is he's going outside the group.

171
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,886
You'd still head up Manufacturing...

172
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:20,262
...presumably.

173
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,516
Wait a minute.

174
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,144
I might be out of a job?

175
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:30,230
- Don't get paranoid all of a sudden.
- I'm a quick learner.

176
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:34,568
You wouldn't make somebody VP
and not let them appoint their own team.

177
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:36,445
How would that look?

178
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,281
Phil, am I out of a job?

179
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:44,078
Come on, Tom.
I'm already out on a limb.

180
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,673
You gonna be okay? You want a Prozac?

181
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,926
No, I'm fine. I'm, uh--

182
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:01,929
I'm disappointed, but I'm fine.

183
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:08,769
You sure?

184
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:13,273
Don't have to worry about me.
I'm a stockholder. Whatever's...

185
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,983
...best for the company.

186
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,841
If you wanna leave a message...

187
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,448
...for Susan, Tom, Matt and Eliza...

188
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,303
...please do after the beep.
Thanks for calling. Bye.

189
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,521
- Obviously, he's disappointed.
- But he took it well?

190
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,857
Overall, I'd say yes.

191
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:58,485
I don't want any bumps before the merger.
I don't want him quitting.

192
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:00,154
It's up to you.

193
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,739
Just one big happy family.

194
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,158
You got that?

195
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:09,621
I have to tell you, going down to see him
this morning was a masterstroke.

196
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,040
It really put him on the defensive.

197
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,001
I'll keep an eye on him.

198
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:15,878
He'll get on the program.

199
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,881
When push comes to shove,
he doesn't have the guts.

200
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:29,558
Let me ask you something.
You know Susan.

201
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,769
If I heard a rumor about the...

202
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,897
...future of the company...

203
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,899
...my future...

204
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:40,027
...you know, nothing crazy, a real rumor...

205
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,656
...what would Susan say?
You think she'd say go see Garvin?

206
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,052
Hey. Here's a guy you should meet.

207
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,596
Tom Sanders.
He heads up our Manufacturing.

208
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,390
Steven Chase, Crescent Capital.
John Conley.

209
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,725
You're John Conley?

210
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:15,604
Junior. Dad's coming on Friday
with members of the Board.

211
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:18,732
- Catch you at the lunch.
- Tom, come on in.

212
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:21,443
You wanted to see me about something.

213
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:22,945
Yeah, sorry about this morning.

214
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,905
- You know how it is with kids.
- Yeah.

215
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:28,158
- Have you ever met Meredith Johnson?
- Hi.

216
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:30,953
What's the matter?
That's a hello you'd give to a rash.

217
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,372
I'm preoccupied.
It's nothing to do with you.

218
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,832
Sanders and I go way back.
He broke my heart.

219
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,042
She's making that up.

220
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,462
I thought your heart was made of
that plastic they use for helmets.

221
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,464
He said I could be anything I wanted.

222
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,633
- He got that right.
- It was a line.

223
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:47,302
- It wasn't a line.
- I had no idea you knew each other.

224
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:51,056
What's that Wilde line? "I like a man
with a future and a woman with a past."

225
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:53,684
Somebody said you were in Operations.

226
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:56,228
I don't know. Bob, am I?

227
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,773
The last few years,
I've been cleaning up the mess...

228
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:02,109
- ...Bob's made of this company.
- Ha-ha-ha.

229
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:04,736
If it's such a mess, how come I'm so rich?

230
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,905
Yes, but you're a lot richer now.

231
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,074
We should catch up. Get together.

232
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,367
I'd love that.

233
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:12,160
Plenty of time for that now.

234
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,747
I remember flying over Wyoming,
I thought this merger was dead.

235
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:20,502
Conley was choking on the valuation.
The spin-off was Meredith's idea.

236
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,171
Don't say that too loud.
Conley thinks it was theirs.

237
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:26,216
- Really?
- Lit them up like a Christmas tree.

238
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:27,593
Meredith saved the merger.

239
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,887
You have money now.
You could even buy yourself a new tie.

240
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,102
So, what was it you wanted to see me about?

241
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:43,400
Meredith-fucking-Johnson!
Son of a bitch. Goddamn Garvin.

242
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:44,610
- What?
- I didn't get it.

243
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,820
- You're not the new VP?
- He announced it?

244
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:49,573
It was a secret.
He's got her installed in the office...

245
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:52,242
...bouncing back and forth
like it's the Tonight Show.

246
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,037
- Who's Meredith Johnson?
- Will this affect the spin-off?

247
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,538
This is a technical division.

248
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:59,625
She doesn't know the difference
between software and a sweater.

249
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,209
What aren't you telling us?

250
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:05,505
I might be out of a job. Is that enough?
You know what it's like out there?

251
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,842
- He said something about the spin-off.
- They didn't tell me about me!

252
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,553
Think they'll tell me about the spin-off?

253
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,641
I'm sorry.

254
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:19,686
This is the worst day of my life.
All right?

255
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,647
Who is she?

256
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,649
Let me guess: attractive?

257
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:27,361
- What does that have to do with anything?
- Nipples like pencil erasers?

258
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,696
She's attractive. Very attractive.

259
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:32,991
- Sleeping with Garvin?
- That's why he bought the Nordic Track.

260
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,869
It's a curse to be me.
Life holds no surprises.

261
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,954
This is such a cliché.

262
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,666
How do you think a cliché becomes a cliché?

263
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,460
You mean like, "Size doesn't matter"?

264
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,629
I have such a thing for you.

265
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:48,799
All right, please, can we get some work done?

266
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,468
We got a small problem with Arcamax.

267
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,553
- It isn't the design.
- It's not the code.

268
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:58,141
Any woman has to be twice as good
as a man and work harder for less pay.

269
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:00,102
See that, Hunter? Cliché grande.

270
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,229
How do you think a cliché becomes a cliché?

271
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:05,816
Hunter, it is very weird.
We don't know anything about this woman.

272
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,777
I do. I had a thing with her.

273
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,946
Ha, ha, you are amazing.

274
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:13,448
- It was years ago.
- Tommy.

275
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,826
You've seen more ass than a rental car.

276
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:19,246
Get a few more women in your life
so you can be a census.

277
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,331
Maybe you can sleep your way up.

278
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:22,666
Yeah, right.

279
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:25,919
Wait, why? Why her and not Tom?
He's not attractive?

280
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:27,921
Because men and women are different.

281
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,631
Not in a way that matters to you.

282
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:32,217
Are you saying I'm a virgin?

283
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,315
Meanwhile, you were asking me about the spin-off.

284
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:49,901
Garvin said it was her idea.

285
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,786
It's always such a pleasure to come to Seattle...

286
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,497
...and spend time with the
Advanced Products Group.

287
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:05,417
I feel such a warmth for the people here.

288
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:09,421
On the cutting edge. I feel a kinship.
And I've always wanted to give you....

289
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,173
Is this seat taken?

290
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,427
...the most advanced original
leadership that I could. Push the envelope.

291
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,012
How are you?

292
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,849
- Sorry you didn't get your promotion.
- I'm sorry you didn't get it either.

293
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,435
How long have you known?

294
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:27,439
Really? That long?

295
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:30,609
Every time I've wanted to promote a woman...

296
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,694
...to break the glass ceiling...

297
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:35,030
...it's always been the same story:

298
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:37,449
"But, Bob.... But, Bob...."

299
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:43,288
I've thought about it often since
my daughter's death, that had she lived...

300
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,707
...it would be extremely rare...

301
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,126
...that she ever got to run a company.

302
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:52,047
So it has a special meaning
for me when I tell you...

303
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:54,382
...that Friday, when we announce the merger...

304
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:59,513
...we will also announce that the new VP
for Advanced Operations and Planning...

305
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,807
...here in Seattle...

306
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,142
...will be Meredith Johnson.

307
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,236
Unbelievable.

308
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:19,199
Thanks, Bob. Can I have the lights?

309
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:30,961
The Advanced Products Group has been
the heart of DigiCom for the last 10 years.

310
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:34,840
Advanced Products has historically
consisted of four divisions....

311
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:38,593
You seem to be spending a lot more time up here.

312
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:42,764
My son's a freshman at the university.
This way I get to see more of him.

313
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:45,350
I thought it had to do with the merger.

314
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:48,353
This merger means everything to Garvin.

315
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:52,816
Give a man a $100 million
and you create a frustrated billionaire.

316
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:56,987
The new compression algorithms
should shift industry standards...

317
00:19:57,154 --> 00:20:00,198
...to full-res digitized video
at 60 fields per second...

318
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:03,702
...with platform-independent
RISC processors supported by...

319
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,579
...a 32-bit color-active....

320
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:09,916
Conley's a conservative company.
Is Meredith conservative?

321
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,626
I don't know.

322
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,920
I thought you knew her.

323
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,591
Is there anything you don't know?

324
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:20,594
We offer, through technology...

325
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:24,347
...what religion and revolution
have promised but never delivered:

326
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,308
Freedom from the physical body.

327
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,269
Freedom from race and gender...

328
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:33,523
...from nationality and personality,
from place and time.

329
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:36,484
Communicating by cellular phone
and hand-held computer...

330
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:38,987
...PDA and built-in fax modem...

331
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:42,115
...we can relate to each
other as pure consciousness.

332
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,582
Smart, touching base with all the division heads.

333
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,960
Especially since she didn't name them
in her speech.

334
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,047
Does it mean something?

335
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,925
Only if she plans to make changes.

336
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:04,220
Phil said she wasn't planning
on making any changes.

337
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,140
You know Meredith.

338
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:11,436
Stephanie, wait a minute.

339
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,772
I gotta know, am I out of a job?

340
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:17,275
What was she bending your ear about all lunch?

341
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,694
Uh, Stephanie? Um, nothing.
Just small talk.

342
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:22,614
What, all of a sudden there's Stephanie Lite?

343
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:25,992
She's, uh, talking about her son
at the university.

344
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:29,621
- Sorry I didn't get to mention you.
- That's okay. That's fine.

345
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:32,832
I'm jammed all day but why
don't you come up around 7?

346
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,669
We'll have a drink and catch up on business.

347
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,212
Sure, that'd be great.

348
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,215
I remember how you liked
a good bottle of wine. I'll get one.

349
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:51,434
- What's she want to see you at 7 about?
- I'm sure it's the problems with Arcamax.

350
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:54,813
We gotta get in sync before
these Conley guys ask questions.

351
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:56,856
She doesn't give you a boner?

352
00:21:57,024 --> 00:22:00,026
Because, you know, I definitely have lift-off.

353
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,153
What about you? You got a woody?

354
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,655
She's very nice.

355
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:06,408
- I'll tell you what the company line is.
- Don't do that.

356
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:10,578
You have a sexual urge every 20 minutes.
It's a physiological certainty.

357
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,872
It's hard-wired into your limbic brain.

358
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,835
You can't fight it.
Why would you want to? Live a little.

359
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:20,005
Ten years from now,
you'll need a forklift to get a hard-on.

360
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,299
- Ha-ha-ha. I'll call you.
- I'm counting the minutes.

361
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,514
There you are.
Where've you been all day?

362
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:33,560
I didn't get it.

363
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:37,689
No, they went outside the division.
Someone from Operations.

364
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:42,068
What can I say? I got passed over.

365
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:44,904
Yeah. What can I say?

366
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,908
So did you get those tickets for Disneyland?

367
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:53,204
No, I know, but I promised the guy and it's....

368
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,914
Mohammed Jafar.

369
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,209
Right, so it's one F.

370
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:02,047
Thanks a lot. Probably won't be home
for dinner tonight. Don't wait up.

371
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:04,924
Okay.

372
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,386
I love you too. Bye.

373
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,145
Are there any asset sale triggers?

374
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,064
In the indenture?

375
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:03,942
Mm-hm.

376
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:06,486
Will you do me a favor?

377
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,864
Look, Alan, Brown will go 250 on this, easy.

378
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:12,826
Let's just do this thing as a top-down recap.

379
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,830
Not a bad idea for a girl, huh?

380
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:20,500
Let's talk first thing. Okay, bye.

381
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:23,711
'91 Pahlmeyer. How'd you know?
I've been looking all over for it.

382
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,589
I like all the boys under me to be happy.

383
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:30,135
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

384
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:37,642
Mm. I brought the files up for Arcamax
if you wanna go over them.

385
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,644
Let me see your pictures.

386
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:41,146
The, uh, diagrams?

387
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,398
Your family. You have pictures?

388
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:45,108
Yeah, sure.

389
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,116
Here's, uh.... Here

390
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:57,203
That's Matthew.
That's Eliza at Halloween.

391
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,832
- And here's Susan with the kids.
- Ah.

392
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,710
She looks like she always has
food in the refrigerator.

393
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:07,172
- She never lost the baby weight--
- I didn't say she looks like a refrigerator.

394
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,966
- Ha-ha-ha.
- I mean, she's made a home for you.

395
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:13,845
In my fridge I've got bottles
of champagne and an orange.

396
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,555
Doesn't Eliza look beautiful?

397
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:17,348
She looks like Susan.

398
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,060
It can be inhibiting.

399
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:23,021
- What's that?
- Domesticity.

400
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:25,398
Ah. You'd be surprised.

401
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:27,942
I don't imagine you can jump her from behind...

402
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:32,739
...because you get excited by the way
she bends to pick up the soap.

403
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,908
Remember that?

404
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:37,076
I remember that.

405
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,870
And you miss it.

406
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:42,373
I have my compensations.

407
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,752
Of course. Life's a series of trade-offs.

408
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,004
I wouldn't trade what I have.

409
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:52,008
I wouldn't want you to.
That's exactly why I can trust you.

410
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,594
You have a lot more to lose than I do.

411
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:04,604
I'll bring you up to speed
on the problems with the drives.

412
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:07,190
You kept in good shape, Tom.

413
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,275
Nice and hard.

414
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,819
Thank you.

415
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:26,084
Meredith, it's different now.

416
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:29,045
You're my boss.

417
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,005
It's different.

418
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,802
Okay.

419
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:39,222
Rub my shoulders and I'll listen
to your problems.

420
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:56,948
The specs and the seek times
call for 100 milliseconds.

421
00:26:57,116 --> 00:27:00,952
We have that on the prototypes.
But the drives coming off the line--

422
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,579
- Do you have the drives here?
- It might be a chip.

423
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:06,082
- Answer my question.
- I'm trying to.

424
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:10,962
Understand the controller chip
positions the split optics.

425
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,463
I'll show you the schematic.

426
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:15,300
No, no, no. Rub.

427
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:22,515
- You can't understand the problem--
- Do you have the drives?

428
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:23,766
Arthur sent five units--

429
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,146
- Did I say no calls?
- It's Mr. Garvin.

430
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:29,814
But after that, nobody.

431
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:32,317
Is it all right if I leave for the day?

432
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,152
That's fine, Mrs. Ross.

433
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:43,786
You'd rather talk about
a million different things...

434
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:46,539
...than answer my question,
because you don't know.

435
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:51,044
You don't know what the problem is.
But you can't say, "I don't know"...

436
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:55,840
...because in your mind that means
you lose. You're worthless. Men.

437
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:58,885
- What will you tell Conley?
- I can't lie to them.

438
00:27:59,053 --> 00:28:02,305
Talk about the prototypes. They work.

439
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:04,015
Focus on the positive.

440
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:07,018
We're on-line.
It's not about the prototypes.

441
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:09,562
They wanna know you're
confident you can build it.

442
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:13,274
- I understand that, but I--
- Do you have a problem working for me?

443
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,194
No. I, uh....

444
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,156
Hi, Bob. No.

445
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:23,451
You don't wanna hear about my hard day.

446
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:26,371
Yes, that's hard work.

447
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:30,708
- Let me get my docs together.
- Meredith--

448
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:33,211
The merger is not about Arcamax,
it's about people.

449
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:35,380
They're comfortable with me and Bob.

450
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:39,342
This isn't about some CD-ROM
that'll be obsolete in a year.

451
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:42,637
If they ask, then you tell them you don't know.

452
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,389
Hi, Bob, I'm here.

453
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,724
I've got a great idea about that.

454
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:48,768
Go ahead.

455
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:52,814
Lewyn, this is Sanders.

456
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:57,902
I've discussed the drives with Meredith.
She says don't tell the Conley people...

457
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,988
...until we found exactly what the problems are.

458
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:04,659
That is the line for the 8 a.m.
meeting tomorrow--

459
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:07,245
Let's get down to business.

460
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:11,332
Wait a sec, wait a sec.
Meredith, wait a second.

461
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:20,091
- There, was that so bad?
- That's not so bad, it's just--

462
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,679
Come on, while there's still
a chance we might get caught.

463
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:28,099
No, no.

464
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,601
Oh, yes, I think so.

465
00:29:33,856 --> 00:29:36,107
Meredith, no, no, no.

466
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:40,194
Some things never change,
and some things just get better.

467
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:42,196
Meredith, come on.

468
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:46,242
Meredith, Meredith, no.

469
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:51,122
- Remember all the things we did?
- I remember.

470
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:54,041
Things nobody knows about you but me.

471
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,712
All our secrets.

472
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:04,635
Just lie back and let me take you.

473
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:08,890
I could've had anybody and I picked you.

474
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,267
Now you've got all the power.

475
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:17,523
No, no, no. No, no, no.

476
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,736
You've got something I want.

477
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:26,616
- What are you doing?
- Doesn't that make you feel good?

478
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:30,119
- No.
- Just let me. Come on.

479
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:34,916
- Unh. No, no, no.
- Don't worry, I'm not gonna bite.

480
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:38,085
Let me do whatever I want.

481
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:43,633
- You just lie back and let me be the boss.
- No, no, no.

482
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:48,804
No.

483
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:54,519
Meredith. Meredith. No.

484
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,647
Mere--

485
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:03,319
No, no, no.

486
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:05,738
Wait a second. Wait a second.
Wait a minute.

487
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:09,534
- Shh, shh.
- Listen to me. What?

488
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,702
Look, nobody has to know.

489
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,538
Nobody gets hurt.

490
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:17,291
It's just a meeting between two colleagues.

491
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,212
Just another dull day in the computer business.

492
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:23,756
Meredith, no.

493
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:28,636
No.

494
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:33,349
No.

495
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,061
Don't!

496
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:38,854
No! No, no.

497
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,482
Huh? Here

498
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,486
- Want to get fucked?
- Do it.

499
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:47,154
Is that what you want?

500
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:50,283
Come on.

501
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:52,368
- Is that what you want?
- Uh-huh.

502
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,543
You just stay hard.

503
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:07,842
Oh, God.

504
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,647
Unh, heh.

505
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,774
You bad boy.

506
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:27,653
Come on, baby.

507
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:31,032
- Unh. Ooh.
- Yeah. Uh-huh.

508
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,950
- Yeah.
- Unh.

509
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,621
- Oh, yeah.
- Uh-huh. Uh huh.

510
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:41,917
Come on. You gonna fuck me?

511
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:49,300
Put it in.

512
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,640
God, look at us.

513
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:59,769
- I want you inside me. Come on.
- No, no, no.

514
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,479
- I can't do this.
- Put it in.

515
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:03,564
- I'm not gonna do this.
- Now!

516
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:06,108
- I'm not gonna do this! No!
- Now!

517
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:07,485
You can't just stop!

518
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:09,987
- Come on.
- No! Goddamn!

519
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:24,502
You stick your dick in my mouth
then you get an attack of morality?

520
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,839
This never happened.

521
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:32,677
You never used to be this way.

522
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,183
I have a family now.

523
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:41,894
A family made you stupid.

524
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:47,108
You take those two champagne bottles
in your refrigerator...

525
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,609
...and you go fuck them.

526
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:53,864
You son of a bitch.

527
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:57,284
You get back here and finish what you started.

528
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,787
You hear me? Do you hear me?

529
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:03,124
Get back and finish what you started
or you are dead!

530
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,459
Hear me? You are fucking dead!

531
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,449
Shit, it's dead.

532
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:57,613
You are hereby notified
that we will hold your client liable--

533
00:35:57,781 --> 00:36:00,282
- Hi, honey.
- I didn't hear you come in.

534
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,284
I'm gonna take a shower.

535
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:05,412
- No kiss?
- I just feel kind of shitty, you know.

536
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,956
Screw them.

537
00:36:07,249 --> 00:36:10,960
- They don't deserve you.
- Can you get me a beer?

538
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:32,648
Thanks. Before I forget,
could you do me a favor?

539
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:35,150
The, uh, battery went dead in my cellular.

540
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:38,445
Sure. I thought they
were supposed to last all day?

541
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:39,738
That's what I thought.

542
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:43,868
- Who's Meredith Johnson?
- What?

543
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,203
Meredith Johnson.

544
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:49,039
She called just before you got home.

545
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,333
Meredith called?

546
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:53,669
Yeah, about 10 minutes ago.

547
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:00,134
She said the 8 a.m. had been pushed back to 8:30.

548
00:37:00,302 --> 00:37:04,013
- Who is she?
- She's the one, the, uh-- The new VP.

549
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:05,973
She's the one?

550
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:08,142
Yep. She came from the Valley.

551
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:12,354
- How old is she?
- I don't know, um, 33, maybe.

552
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:14,523
That's young for that job.

553
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:18,068
- Had you ever heard of her?
- She's a face guy.

554
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:22,990
She made the merger happen. Now
she's Garvin's fair-haired, uh, whatever.

555
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,871
Where did she come from?
Has she any technical background?

556
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:32,499
No. That's the thing with the merger.
Everything's changed.

557
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:36,462
That's not the worst thing in the world.
She'll crash and burn.

558
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,213
Then maybe they'll appreciate you.

559
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,549
Things aren't easy out there.

560
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:42,343
So quit...

561
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:45,054
...rather than let them treat you this way.

562
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:48,182
We might lose everything,
including the stock options.

563
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:50,392
I don't care about the stock options.

564
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,521
- I'll go back to work full-time.
- I'm capable of supporting our family.

565
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:55,981
Just trying to help.

566
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:57,983
You're too nice sometimes.

567
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:01,153
I don't need you to fight my battles
for me, thank you very much.

568
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:08,035
Right now some lucky girl
in the building will come after me.

569
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,914
I deserve that, but ask yourself...

570
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:16,210
...why does a man run around with
another girl? He's unhappy at home.

571
00:38:16,378 --> 00:38:18,253
Because he's lonely.

572
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:21,924
But that was before you, Fran.
I've stopped running.

573
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:26,553
Why are you wearing a T-shirt?
You never wear a T-shirt to bed.

574
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:29,264
I don't know. Just a little cold.

575
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:32,935
Tom, what are you gonna do?

576
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:36,897
Grin and bear it, like I usually do.

577
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:38,482
Hope it doesn't get any worse.

578
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,085
- Morning.
- Good morning, Bob.

579
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:03,590
- That's a nice suit.
- Thank you.

580
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:08,470
- Nice fabric. Can I feel it?
- Sure.

581
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:13,267
- What is that, a tropical wool?
- With a little bit of viscose.

582
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:16,979
That's what makes the pants drape so well.

583
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:20,858
You work out, Tom?

584
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:25,029
When I get a chance, Bob.
It's been busy lately. But, uh....

585
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,782
I've always liked you, Tom.

586
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:35,789
- Bob....
- Now you have the power.

587
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,168
- You have something I want.
- Come on, Bob.

588
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:01,607
The computer takes
the information from the database...

589
00:40:01,775 --> 00:40:05,194
...and constructs an environment
which is projected in the headset.

590
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:08,363
When the user walks on the pad, he or she...

591
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:13,285
...feels like they're walking through a
corridor with drawers of files on all sides.

592
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:15,788
The user can stop at any time, open any file...

593
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:20,626
...and thumb through the data. The laser
scanners are for body representation.

594
00:40:20,794 --> 00:40:23,045
- That's amazing. Ha, ha.
- It's cool, isn't it?

595
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:30,552
Where is everyone?

596
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,056
They left 15 minutes ago.
Don Cherry's demo-ing the Corridor.

597
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:35,808
The meeting was pushed to 8:30.

598
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:38,102
No, 7:30. It got pushed up.

599
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,645
- Nobody told you?
- No.

600
00:40:39,813 --> 00:40:44,233
If someone wants to log on with
a regular computer, what they'll see...

601
00:40:45,235 --> 00:40:49,822
...is a model of themselves with a photo
that's pulled up from the data file.

602
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:52,407
Oh, hey, I know you.

603
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:55,577
The photo bears some resemblance to me, I admit.

604
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,413
A little inside joke here at the company.

605
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:00,916
We've also constructed virtual help.

606
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:03,335
Users always need on-line help.

607
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:05,420
We've created an angel to help you.

608
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:11,426
Welcome to the Corridor.

609
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:14,930
The same face. Ha-ha-ha.

610
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:19,268
Angel, how do I open this drawer?

611
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,270
What's the angel saying?

612
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,272
That's between him and his angel.

613
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:27,025
We don't see the Corridor
as a product in the marketplace now.

614
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:30,779
This is something that we worked
up to demonstrate the potential...

615
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:32,948
...of virtual reality technology.

616
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:36,827
This looks good. Ha-ha-ha.

617
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:39,621
Hold on. What's that?

618
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:42,457
I believe it's your financial records. Ha, ha.

619
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:46,044
- Turn that damn thing off.
- Ha, ha. Sorry.

620
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:50,632
In the final system there will be
safeguards that will control access.

621
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,384
Tom.

622
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:56,138
So glad you could join us.

623
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:59,224
That was a sweet entrance, my friend.

624
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:04,146
Ferry hit an iceberg? You were supposed to
call me after your meeting with Meredith.

625
00:42:04,314 --> 00:42:07,566
I called you from her office.
Left a message.

626
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:11,570
There was nothing on my machine.
Then you're late again.

627
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:14,698
Thank God Meredith took over the discussion.

628
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:18,660
Hey, pal, I left a message
on your machine, all right?

629
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:20,329
Check it out.

630
00:42:20,914 --> 00:42:22,581
Did you get my message?

631
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:26,418
You told Susan the meeting
had been moved to 8:30.

632
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:30,589
I said 7:30. If your wife can't take
a fucking message, get a machine.

633
00:42:30,757 --> 00:42:32,216
Meredith.

634
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,684
- There you go, Mr. Sanders.
- Thank you.

635
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:44,186
You're welcome.

636
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:47,105
- Full house today, huh?
- Yeah.

637
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:55,447
Meredith has been getting us
up to speed on the Arcamax.

638
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:58,242
Now that you're here, we'd like your read on it.

639
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,535
Meredith told us, uh, there's real problems.

640
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:03,288
You might have to go back to the drawing board.

641
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:08,043
I'm sorry if I conveyed that
impression to Meredith.

642
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:11,046
I am convinced we can manufacture them.

643
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:13,465
How many of the drives off the line meet specs?

644
00:43:14,384 --> 00:43:16,385
I don't have that information with me.

645
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:19,096
Meredith told us
the line is running at 29 percent.

646
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:21,098
Is that approximately right?

647
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:23,892
- Yes.
- The seek times are off-specs.

648
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:27,062
There's a power flicker in the screen?

649
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,231
- Right?
- That's right.

650
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:32,776
With this merger coming up, don't
you think you should have told someone?

651
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:36,488
The merger isn't about a CD-ROM
that might be obsolete in a year.

652
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:38,490
It's about people.

653
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:42,411
- It'll be obsolete in a year?
- The promise of the Arcamax...

654
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:45,205
...was a central factor in this merger.

655
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:48,542
I may be at fault. Tom said the
problem with the drives was serious.

656
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:51,295
- Not so serious.
- I didn't wanna cover anything up.

657
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,423
- I'm not covering anything up.
- Give us worst-case.

658
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:58,510
We go back to the drawing boards
and we're down for nine months.

659
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:01,847
Nine months? Meredith said six weeks.

660
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:07,185
Look, nobody likes to go back to
the board, but it can be an advantage.

661
00:44:07,437 --> 00:44:09,187
Is there a problem?

662
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:12,357
This isn't an inquisition, Bob.
I feel like I'm pulling teeth.

663
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:16,820
John just wants to get a handle on
what the problems are with the lines.

664
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:21,700
- I don't know is the honest answer.
- Wait a minute.

665
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:24,786
You are the head of Manufacturing.

666
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:28,540
You are in charge of Arcamax.
There are problems with it...

667
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:33,086
...that could take nine months to fix,
which I assume means a year.

668
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:34,880
And the bottom line is...

669
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:37,799
...you don't know?

670
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,093
Goddamn it.

671
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:42,429
Goddamn it!

672
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:44,639
Jesus Christ!

673
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:50,812
- Tom.
- Just the man I wanted to see.

674
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:53,315
Phil, this is not gonna work out with Meredith.

675
00:44:53,566 --> 00:44:55,776
- Evidently not.
- She set me up.

676
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:58,779
- She set me up.
- I saw. Sit down.

677
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:02,657
- Why? What'd I do?
- Please, would you just sit?

678
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:08,330
Meredith told me about your meeting last night.

679
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:09,915
What?

680
00:45:12,794 --> 00:45:14,169
What'd she tell you?

681
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:18,215
She wants to handle the intervention
internally, which is best.

682
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:21,593
- She still cares about you.
- Wait a minute.

683
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:23,720
What'd she say?

684
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:28,183
Not to put too fine a point on it,
she said you sexually harassed her.

685
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:31,561
I sexually harassed her?

686
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:35,065
- What would you call it?
- Phil, she jumped me in her office.

687
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:38,568
She jumped you? You're in denial.
That's typical.

688
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,362
She almost raped me.

689
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:43,365
You need help.
You have to accept responsibility for--

690
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:46,868
What do you call this?
What about that?

691
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:49,246
Looks like she was forced to defend herself.

692
00:45:49,414 --> 00:45:54,000
Defend herself? The woman can
kick the shit out of both of us!

693
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:57,003
- It may have seemed different to you.
- I didn't harass her.

694
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,713
She harassed me.

695
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:01,591
I've never even heard of a woman harassing a man.

696
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,218
What are you doing here?

697
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:06,221
- I'm here as your friend.
- My ass, you're my friend.

698
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:11,226
When Garvin finds out about this, he's
gonna wanna throw you out on your ass.

699
00:46:11,394 --> 00:46:13,520
I'm saying let's keep this quiet.

700
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:18,400
That's what Meredith wants too.
Resolve this quickly and quietly.

701
00:46:18,568 --> 00:46:20,360
Want your wife to find out?

702
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:22,529
We're gonna have to tell her at some point.

703
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:26,491
They'll get the whole thing,
and it'll be on the front page of the paper!

704
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:29,369
I'm offering you a chance to make a new life.

705
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:32,372
Keep your family out of this mess.
Keep your job.

706
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,334
Obviously, some kind of lateral move.

707
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:39,754
Lateral? When you say lateral,
you mean out of the division.

708
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:41,840
You can't stay here.

709
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,050
She's scared out of her wits.

710
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:49,848
I'm not leaving this division.
I've spent 10 years here. I built this place.

711
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:55,437
- Now, we got a spin-off going on--
- We're thinking, you know, Austin.

712
00:46:55,897 --> 00:46:57,230
Austin?

713
00:46:57,565 --> 00:47:01,860
I told him what she said.
He claimed it was the other way around.

714
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:04,696
He said she harassed him.

715
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:08,074
What? He denies it?

716
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:10,660
You know how it is.
The man always denies it.

717
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,204
Is he crazy?

718
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:14,372
I offered him a lateral move to Austin.

719
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:18,752
To Austin. That's like a duck making
a lateral move to "á l'orange."

720
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:20,921
Phil, he's too smart for that.

721
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:24,132
Let's hope he's smart enough
to see he has no options.

722
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,759
Take care of this.

723
00:47:25,927 --> 00:47:30,430
This is a goddamn bomb we're sitting on
that can blow everything sky-high.

724
00:47:30,598 --> 00:47:35,435
Meredith is key to the merger.
I can't have her involved in a sex scandal.

725
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:39,231
And I won't say goodbye to $100 million.
You got that?

726
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:41,733
Yeah, I-- I get the picture, Bob.

727
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:38,391
Tenth floor.
Down the hall and make a right.

728
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:47,025
- There were no witnesses?
- No.

729
00:49:47,193 --> 00:49:49,694
Her assistant left earlier in the evening.

730
00:49:49,862 --> 00:49:54,074
A cleaning lady was outside the office.
I don't know how much she heard.

731
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:57,410
- Did you report that to anyone?
- In the morning, yeah.

732
00:49:57,578 --> 00:49:59,704
What was the company's response?

733
00:49:59,872 --> 00:50:02,749
They believed her.
They suggested I transfer to Austin.

734
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:04,584
I heard they were selling Austin.

735
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:09,422
The point is, if I go to Austin,
I lose everything, all right?

736
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:12,759
My stock options, everything that I worked for.

737
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:16,054
- Did you call anyone after the incident?
- No.

738
00:50:16,222 --> 00:50:17,764
- Did you tell your wife?
- No.

739
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:20,266
- Oh, boy.
- Why not?

740
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:25,563
I didn't wanna upset her. I felt guilty putting
myself in the position in the first place.

741
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:28,608
How would you characterize
Miss Johnson physically?

742
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:33,071
She's very pretty.
She was Miss Teenage New Mexico.

743
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:34,614
So you were kissing.

744
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:38,785
Yes. And then she began to rub me.

745
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:40,745
Rub you where?

746
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:43,957
You know....

747
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:47,544
Your penis?

748
00:50:47,795 --> 00:50:48,962
Yes.

749
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:51,089
And?

750
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:55,885
I don't feel comfortable talking about it.

751
00:50:56,887 --> 00:51:00,140
- Because I'm a woman?
- Because you act like it's a game.

752
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:03,643
- Mr. Sanders, why are you here?
- I want to know what my options are.

753
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:05,145
What your options are?

754
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:09,065
I wanna know whether I can sue her
for sexual harassment.

755
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:11,317
To do that, you have to convince a jury...

756
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:15,405
...you were alone with Miss Teenage
New Mexico and you said no.

757
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:19,993
Sexual harassment is not about sex.

758
00:51:20,745 --> 00:51:22,662
It is about power.

759
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:25,832
She has it, you don't.

760
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:29,419
If you sue, you'll never
get another job in computers.

761
00:51:29,587 --> 00:51:34,507
If you don't, they'll bury you in Austin.
Sue, and it's news. Don't, it's gossip.

762
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:37,761
If you sue, no one will believe you.
If you don't, your wife won't.

763
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:42,348
They will make your life hell for the next
three years until this case goes to trial.

764
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:47,353
And for that privilege, it's gonna
cost you a minimum of $100,000.

765
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:53,109
Do you not think it's a game, Mr. Sanders?
It's a game to them.

766
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:55,570
How do you feel about losing?

767
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,624
That's what Meredith wants.

768
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:11,544
To resolve it, quickly and quietly.

769
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:23,223
They said she's not gonna press charges.
Why?

770
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:27,227
She's accused me. Why stop there?
Why not press charges?

771
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:30,396
Meredith didn't press charges...

772
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:32,398
...because she couldn't.

773
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:35,068
DigiCom is planning a merger with Conley-White.

774
00:52:35,236 --> 00:52:37,654
It is supposed to happen this Friday.

775
00:52:37,822 --> 00:52:41,491
They think that we are as conservative
as they are.

776
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:46,412
With a scandal, Conley going to bed with
Katie Couric, waking up with Jessica Hahn.

777
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,832
Garvin is out $100 million.

778
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:52,085
I think we might make a plaintiff
out of this guy yet.

779
00:52:52,253 --> 00:52:56,923
No, a potential plaintiff.
I don't have to sue. I just threaten to sue.

780
00:52:57,091 --> 00:53:00,760
That's a very dangerous game.
Are you willing to play it?

781
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:04,180
- Fuck them.
- Now you're talking my language.

782
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:06,015
For the next three days...

783
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:10,436
...this loose cannon is in a position
to put a lot of pressure on this company.

784
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:14,274
And they on you, Mr. Sanders.
They on you.

785
00:53:17,236 --> 00:53:20,405
Call security.
Throw him out on the sidewalk.

786
00:53:20,573 --> 00:53:24,576
Bob, we have to appear to be impartial.

787
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:27,495
Keep him in his job, keep paying him, no hassles.

788
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:30,999
I made Tom Sanders.
Who the hell is he to sue me?

789
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:33,334
Sexual harassment, under Title Seven.

790
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:38,131
He'll file with the Human Rights
Commission if we don't fire Meredith.

791
00:53:38,299 --> 00:53:42,176
If he files, it becomes public.
It'd blow the deal.

792
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:45,930
We realize that. So does he.
He's blackmailing us.

793
00:53:46,098 --> 00:53:48,266
This is America, goddamn it.

794
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:51,769
The legal system is supposed
to protect people like me.

795
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:53,605
It gets worse.

796
00:53:53,856 --> 00:53:57,442
His lawyer is Catherine Alvarez.

797
00:53:57,610 --> 00:54:02,530
Great. She'd change her name to
"TV Listings" just to get it in the paper.

798
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:06,284
I'm trying to get them to mediate.
Keep it quiet.

799
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:09,037
Mediate?

800
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:12,123
I want you to cut his balls off.

801
00:54:12,291 --> 00:54:14,792
Did he say mediate or split the difference?

802
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,713
I'm just hoping he'll agree.
Alvarez will tell him not to.

803
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:21,549
He'll agree.
He doesn't want this out in the open.

804
00:54:21,717 --> 00:54:24,802
We pushed him too hard.
He has nothing to lose.

805
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:27,639
Really? He hasn't told his wife yet.

806
00:54:29,642 --> 00:54:30,892
How do you know?

807
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:35,104
I know Sanders, remember?
He likes his secrets.

808
00:54:42,905 --> 00:54:43,947
Excuse me.

809
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:46,157
- I'll be in diagnostics.
- Where were you?

810
00:54:46,325 --> 00:54:48,076
They're pulling the drives apart.

811
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:50,203
- John Levin called.
- Levin with Sematach?

812
00:54:50,371 --> 00:54:53,456
- He said it was important.
- Why didn't they come this morning?

813
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:56,250
Susan called to remind you
you had the benefit tonight.

814
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:59,170
- Call Susan and--
- She said don't think about canceling.

815
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:03,174
- The Lewyns paid a lot for the tickets.
- I'll be there at 7:30.

816
00:55:03,342 --> 00:55:05,718
- Ask her to bring me a shirt and jacket.
- Sure. Tom.

817
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:07,845
- Yeah.
- Is everything all right?

818
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:11,516
Everything is fine, thank you for asking.

819
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:15,603
I'm gonna kill Arthur.

820
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:19,607
We gotta solve this before Friday,
and you get the drives an hour ago?

821
00:55:19,775 --> 00:55:21,734
What is Arthur doing over there?

822
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:25,196
All he does anymore is pass
macadamia nuts to people.

823
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:28,574
Is he a manager or a flight attendant,
for chrissake?

824
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:31,411
- He's sending you nuts?
- What's slowing it down?

825
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:35,248
Over here.
Let me show you something.

826
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:37,709
Arthur was right.

827
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:40,920
There's a compatibility problem
with the controller chip.

828
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,380
Is it a bug?

829
00:55:42,548 --> 00:55:45,633
Don Cherry debugged Arcamax.
There are no bugs.

830
00:55:45,801 --> 00:55:47,552
- Fabrication problem?
- It could--

831
00:55:48,262 --> 00:55:49,804
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

832
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:53,433
This is a sophisticated piece
of electronics, not a pickup truck.

833
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:58,021
Don, how bad is it? We have 4,000
of these. I gotta junk all of them?

834
00:55:58,689 --> 00:56:03,568
I told Arthur to send me 10 units in
heat-sealed plastic bags. It's a hunch I have.

835
00:56:03,736 --> 00:56:06,279
Do what you can.
I don't understand it.

836
00:56:06,447 --> 00:56:10,742
In prototypes, we got no problems.
We go to manufacturing, it falls apart.

837
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:14,454
Mr. Garvin wants to see you.
He said not to tell anyone.

838
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:18,082
Catherine Alvarez on 2.

839
00:56:18,417 --> 00:56:20,585
Thanks. Could you close the door?

840
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:29,552
Hello.

841
00:56:34,266 --> 00:56:35,683
Hi. How are you?

842
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:40,688
They wanna mediate. We should agree.
I don't want this getting out either.

843
00:56:41,857 --> 00:56:43,399
Mm-hm.

844
00:56:44,485 --> 00:56:50,031
Yeah.

845
00:56:55,287 --> 00:56:59,082
If we get this all over in a week,
my wife doesn't have to know.

846
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:09,842
No, I do not wanna tell my wife.
I don't wanna upset her if I don't have to.

847
00:57:18,894 --> 00:57:20,186
Yeah.

848
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:28,653
Wait a second.

849
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:46,379
Guess what.

850
00:57:47,256 --> 00:57:50,341
They locked me out of my computer
and cleaned out my files.

851
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:53,803
I guess it's starting.

852
00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:00,935
Mark, come in.
Sure I'm not interrupting?

853
00:58:01,103 --> 00:58:02,812
No, not at all, sir.

854
00:58:15,576 --> 00:58:17,076
Going down?

855
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:22,456
Aw, don't tell me you're scared of me.

856
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,216
I didn't want it to be this way.

857
00:58:32,384 --> 00:58:35,303
Oh, yeah, we could be fucking
in the elevator right now.

858
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:38,431
- I think of you as a friend.
- Oh, come off it!

859
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:39,891
You called Blackburn--

860
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:42,435
To beat you to the punch.
I knew you'd play that card.

861
00:58:42,603 --> 00:58:45,146
I wasn't playing a card.
You were the one that was supposed--

862
00:58:46,815 --> 00:58:50,067
Uh-oh. Alarm. Alarm. Alarm.

863
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:52,904
This isn't a game.

864
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:56,741
Come on. You'd have a great job,
the spin-off would make you a millionaire.

865
00:58:56,909 --> 00:58:59,327
We'd have a little fun.
It's not like breaking rocks.

866
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:01,287
You don't get it.

867
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:05,917
Poor Sanders. You have no idea
what you're up against.

868
00:59:06,418 --> 00:59:07,752
As usual.

869
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:11,005
By this time tomorrow
you'll wish you took that Austin job.

870
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:14,926
We'll see.

871
00:59:16,637 --> 00:59:20,348
I'm trying to figure out whether
to get a fat Barbie for Eliza.

872
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:22,225
Mattel makes a fat Barbie?

873
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:25,102
Yeah. They call her
the "Happy to Be Me Barbie."

874
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:27,605
Does she come with the
"Happy to Be Divorced Ken"?

875
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:30,107
Heh. I'm serious.

876
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:31,984
Which is more stigmatizing?

877
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:34,487
Yeah, Barbie's stigmatized.

878
00:59:34,655 --> 00:59:38,491
It's that whole male, 36-24-36 image of beauty.

879
00:59:38,659 --> 00:59:40,368
Women are oppressed.
It's just a fact.

880
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:42,286
Women are oppressed? Ah.

881
00:59:42,454 --> 00:59:47,333
Eighty percent of suicides are committed by
men. They're dropping from heart attacks.

882
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:50,253
- You're not as tough.
- Sorry. We're just fighting the wars.

883
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:52,171
You start the wars.

884
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:55,591
I'm sorry.
I don't have my own crisis hotline.

885
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:59,887
- You're taking this Meredith thing well.
- That doesn't have anything to do with it.

886
01:00:00,055 --> 01:00:02,932
What was today's rumor?
She was once a man?

887
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:05,810
- Just tell her.
- Tell her what?

888
01:00:05,978 --> 01:00:08,896
Tell her there's a lot of us
who have worked as hard as you...

889
01:00:09,064 --> 01:00:13,025
...and you're blowing this merger
for all of us because you fucked up.

890
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:16,153
What happened?

891
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:21,784
- Who got to you?
- It's not that simple, Tom.

892
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:26,414
The thought of losing millions happens
to get stuck right here in my throat.

893
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:30,710
This was my big shot, asshole.
It's not like I'm being scouted by the NBA.

894
01:00:30,961 --> 01:00:32,503
Mark, what happened?

895
01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:37,216
Who knows? The old girlfriend,
the bottle of wine, the late meeting...

896
01:00:37,384 --> 01:00:39,677
- ...fill in the blanks.
- Thanks, pal. Thanks.

897
01:00:39,845 --> 01:00:41,470
You're like these women...

898
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:45,433
...who think they're going back
to the hotel room, drunk, to watch HBO.

899
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,435
Could you possibly be more lame?

900
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:50,396
For your information, Mark,
Tom told me everything.

901
01:00:51,148 --> 01:00:53,190
Everything that happened.

902
01:00:53,734 --> 01:00:55,735
And I support him 100 percent.

903
01:00:56,153 --> 01:01:00,323
- That is so sweet, but I don't think--
- I don't think we should talk about it.

904
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:03,367
Can we just enjoy the evening?

905
01:01:15,589 --> 01:01:18,257
- Susan--
- Obviously, something happened.

906
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:19,967
- Did you have sex with her?
- No!

907
01:01:20,135 --> 01:01:23,012
- Think first. Because if you're lying--
- No, I said, no.

908
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:28,100
She kissed me, and she unzipped my pants, and....

909
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:30,770
- And?
- And that was it. Nothing happened.

910
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:32,938
Nothing happened?
How did it get that far?

911
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:35,858
- You think I encouraged her?
- Her hand was in your pants?

912
01:01:36,026 --> 01:01:38,319
- Yeah, but nothing happened.
- How did that happen?

913
01:01:38,487 --> 01:01:40,780
Then she accuses me of sexual harassment--

914
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:42,865
- She harassed you?
- You don't believe me?

915
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:44,533
- Mark doesn't believe you.
- Mark.

916
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:47,870
He's got, uh, stock options on the brain.
He's got fits of back-stabbing.

917
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:50,539
Everybody's sure you're having
an affair with Cindy.

918
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:54,001
- I'm not having an affair.
- How could you let this happen?

919
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:56,754
- Nothing happened.
- Something happened.

920
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:01,384
She's an old girlfriend of yours.

921
01:02:01,635 --> 01:02:05,513
Like I'm surprised. That's as
exclusive a club as the white pages.

922
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:15,064
- I was gonna tell you.
- I can't believe everyone knows but me.

923
01:02:15,232 --> 01:02:19,193
- Nobody knows it.
- You're so naive. Of course they know.

924
01:02:20,821 --> 01:02:23,823
I'm old-fashioned.
I greet my subordinates with a handshake.

925
01:02:24,032 --> 01:02:26,867
- I'll take care of it.
- Jesus.

926
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:30,663
What does she look like?

927
01:02:31,331 --> 01:02:33,040
She's attractive.

928
01:02:33,333 --> 01:02:35,042
One to ten.

929
01:02:35,419 --> 01:02:36,544
Eight.

930
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:39,672
Nine.

931
01:02:41,675 --> 01:02:43,676
What does the company say?

932
01:02:43,844 --> 01:02:47,096
They want me to transfer to Austin,
do some therapy.

933
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:49,640
Austin? I'm not moving there.

934
01:02:49,808 --> 01:02:52,184
- We're not moving to Austin.
- Texas?

935
01:02:52,686 --> 01:02:54,646
- Susan, I'm pressing charges.
- For what?

936
01:02:54,813 --> 01:02:57,857
Sexual harassment.
We have a mediation tomorrow.

937
01:02:58,066 --> 01:03:00,067
When were you gonna tell me?

938
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:04,155
That's brilliant.
Show up without your wife, who's a lawyer.

939
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:05,364
I'll take care of it.

940
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:07,283
They'll try to destroy you.

941
01:03:07,451 --> 01:03:10,119
- It won't go that far.
- It'll take over our life.

942
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:14,790
Depositions and whispering and legal fees
for some damn personal vindication.

943
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:19,628
And all anyone remembers is that
you were involved in something sleazy.

944
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:22,715
- Do you have a lawyer?
- Catherine Alvarez.

945
01:03:22,883 --> 01:03:24,925
Great. When are we on Hard Copy?

946
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:27,261
But if it had happened to you--

947
01:03:27,429 --> 01:03:29,555
You know how many times it's happened to me?

948
01:03:29,723 --> 01:03:32,808
- You never said this ever happened--
- You're so narcissistic.

949
01:03:32,976 --> 01:03:35,060
Nothing ever happens until it happens to you.

950
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:38,814
- You should've said something.
- I do what women always do.

951
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:43,235
I deal with it. I do not make a federal case.
Now go in there tomorrow and work it out.

952
01:03:43,403 --> 01:03:46,030
Right. I should shut up and fuck her.
What the hell?

953
01:03:46,198 --> 01:03:48,032
Apologize and get your job back.

954
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:50,159
- Apologize?
- Shh, shh!

955
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:52,328
The children are sleeping.

956
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:56,790
Wait, I got a better idea.
Why don't I just admit it?

957
01:03:56,958 --> 01:04:00,044
I'll be the evil white male
you're all complaining about.

958
01:04:00,212 --> 01:04:02,588
- Then I can fuck everybody.
- Tom, stop it.

959
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:05,382
Chau-Minh, come on down,
I wanna exercise my dominance!

960
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:07,676
- You're scaring her.
- I have an urge!

961
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:12,431
- The children!
- My children that I provide for and protect!

962
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:17,144
They can come between me and my wife,
move us, take my job...

963
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:19,355
...and take the house we have made!

964
01:04:19,523 --> 01:04:21,941
And I apologize to them, Susan?

965
01:04:22,943 --> 01:04:26,529
They call me a rapist and I apologize?
Come on. This is a joke.

966
01:04:28,031 --> 01:04:32,034
Sexual harassment is about power.

967
01:04:32,202 --> 01:04:35,412
When did I have the power?

968
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:37,164
When?

969
01:05:45,567 --> 01:05:47,776
Good morning, I'm Judge Murphy.

970
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:50,070
This is a mediation, not a court of law.

971
01:05:50,238 --> 01:05:55,159
Our proceedings will remain confidential.
Maintain a civil and courteous tone.

972
01:05:55,327 --> 01:05:58,245
Our goal is to determine the nature
of the dispute...

973
01:05:58,413 --> 01:06:01,081
...and how best to resolve it.

974
01:06:01,416 --> 01:06:04,752
The parties have agreed that
Mr. Sanders will speak first...

975
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:07,338
...and be cross-examined by Mr. Heller.

976
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:11,508
Ms. Johnson will speak next,
and be cross-examined by Ms. Alvarez.

977
01:06:11,676 --> 01:06:13,010
Any questions?

978
01:06:13,428 --> 01:06:14,762
Good. Let's get started.

979
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:18,599
I had my cellular phone with me,
so when she called Garvin...

980
01:06:18,767 --> 01:06:23,270
...I called Mark Lewyn to give him
the upshot of our meeting.

981
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:24,980
Then she approached you?

982
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:28,859
Correct. She took the phone
from me and she kissed me.

983
01:06:29,027 --> 01:06:30,444
Where?

984
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:33,614
She kissed me in my ear...

985
01:06:33,782 --> 01:06:34,865
...on my neck...

986
01:06:35,033 --> 01:06:36,450
...on my mouth.

987
01:06:36,868 --> 01:06:39,036
She put her tongue in my mouth.

988
01:06:39,371 --> 01:06:41,705
When you asked her to stop, did she?

989
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:44,124
No, no.

990
01:06:44,459 --> 01:06:46,377
She, uh, unzipped my pants...

991
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:48,545
...and she massaged my penis.

992
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:50,714
- Were you aroused?
- Yes.

993
01:06:51,049 --> 01:06:52,675
Then she slid down...

994
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:54,134
...and she...

995
01:06:54,469 --> 01:06:56,220
...put my penis in her mouth.

996
01:06:56,388 --> 01:06:57,971
Did you climax?

997
01:06:58,390 --> 01:07:02,142
I grabbed her by the wrists.
I threw her on the ground.

998
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:04,311
Then I wanted to get out of there.

999
01:07:04,479 --> 01:07:06,772
At that point, what did Ms. Johnson do?

1000
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:08,565
She threatened me.

1001
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:10,818
She said, "You're dead."

1002
01:07:11,486 --> 01:07:15,114
And then, the next day,
Mr. Blackburn here told me that...

1003
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:20,035
...she said that I had sexually harassed her.

1004
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:23,080
Mr. Heller?

1005
01:07:23,248 --> 01:07:26,333
- Sanders, would you like a break?
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.

1006
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:30,170
You say the bottle of wine
was Ms. Johnson's idea?

1007
01:07:30,338 --> 01:07:31,422
Yes.

1008
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:35,426
But, uh, when you were living with Ms. Johnson...

1009
01:07:35,677 --> 01:07:40,013
...didn't you discover wines together
on trips to the Napa Valley?

1010
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:42,683
- Yes.
- Romantic trips?

1011
01:07:43,727 --> 01:07:44,768
Yes.

1012
01:07:44,936 --> 01:07:47,730
But you weren't expecting
anything romantic in her office?

1013
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,064
No.

1014
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:52,526
Did you have a conversation
after lunch about how...

1015
01:07:52,777 --> 01:07:55,362
...seeing Meredith gave you a...

1016
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:56,947
...boner?

1017
01:07:58,241 --> 01:07:59,950
That wasn't me.
That was someone else.

1018
01:08:00,118 --> 01:08:03,120
- Isn't the term "boner" a slang for erection?
- Yes.

1019
01:08:03,538 --> 01:08:05,539
You had a conversation about...

1020
01:08:06,458 --> 01:08:08,709
...having an erection? A boner?

1021
01:08:09,127 --> 01:08:10,753
Yes, but I didn't say it.

1022
01:08:11,296 --> 01:08:13,088
But you laughed.

1023
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:16,133
- Yes.
- So you condone it.

1024
01:08:16,968 --> 01:08:18,635
It was harmless.

1025
01:08:18,887 --> 01:08:20,387
If it's harmless...

1026
01:08:21,222 --> 01:08:22,973
...why are we sitting here today?

1027
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,809
Well, it was just, um...

1028
01:08:25,977 --> 01:08:27,561
...what guys talk about.

1029
01:08:27,729 --> 01:08:29,229
About their boss?

1030
01:08:29,647 --> 01:08:31,148
No, not generally.

1031
01:08:31,316 --> 01:08:35,986
Yet you expect us to believe that
after having a sexual conversation...

1032
01:08:36,154 --> 01:08:38,238
...that you didn't have sex on your mind?

1033
01:08:38,406 --> 01:08:39,948
That's correct.

1034
01:08:40,241 --> 01:08:43,452
How would you characterize your
relationship with Ms. Johnson...

1035
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:45,162
...in the good old days?

1036
01:08:45,497 --> 01:08:46,914
Highly sexual?

1037
01:08:47,332 --> 01:08:48,999
I wouldn't know how to rate it.

1038
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:51,418
Every day?

1039
01:08:51,669 --> 01:08:54,421
Sometimes twice a day.
Sex in public places.

1040
01:08:54,589 --> 01:08:56,965
Sodomy. Viewing of pornography.

1041
01:08:57,801 --> 01:09:00,469
Vibrators and other mechanical devices.

1042
01:09:01,805 --> 01:09:04,598
Sometimes we sat on the couch
and watched television.

1043
01:09:04,766 --> 01:09:10,270
But when you became reacquainted,
you no longer saw her as a sexual object?

1044
01:09:10,438 --> 01:09:12,981
- She was just your boss now?
- That's correct.

1045
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:17,194
And do you admit having an erection
during the course of your meeting?

1046
01:09:17,612 --> 01:09:21,990
She had her top open.
It was an involuntary reflex.

1047
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:23,492
Reflex?

1048
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:27,287
Do you think Ms. Johnson's
gynecologist gets an erection...

1049
01:09:27,455 --> 01:09:29,164
...when he examines her breast?

1050
01:09:29,332 --> 01:09:31,124
I think that's completely different.

1051
01:09:31,292 --> 01:09:34,002
Do you admit putting
your erect penis in her mouth?

1052
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:37,673
- She did it.
- Oh, I forgot.

1053
01:09:38,508 --> 01:09:40,092
You resisted.

1054
01:09:41,469 --> 01:09:46,139
Mr. Sanders, uh, during your
rather fantastic testimony...

1055
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:49,434
...there was one moment that rang true.

1056
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:53,772
You said, and I quote:
"I was angry.

1057
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:55,774
I felt I was being pushed around."

1058
01:09:55,942 --> 01:09:57,568
- Correct?
- Correct.

1059
01:09:57,735 --> 01:10:00,153
The truth is, you felt that way all day.

1060
01:10:00,488 --> 01:10:04,992
You'd been expecting a promotion,
and she got it. You got angry about it.

1061
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:06,994
I felt I deserved the job.

1062
01:10:07,161 --> 01:10:09,830
You took that anger up to her office.

1063
01:10:09,998 --> 01:10:11,832
You were gonna show her who's boss.

1064
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,125
That's not true.

1065
01:10:13,293 --> 01:10:17,921
Mr. Sanders, did you tell your wife about
your 7:00 meeting with Ms. Johnson?

1066
01:10:18,089 --> 01:10:20,424
I told her I had a meeting and I'd be home late.

1067
01:10:20,675 --> 01:10:22,050
You expected to be late?

1068
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:26,722
No, but if I got home earlier,
my wife would be surprised, pleasantly.

1069
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:30,267
So you make it a rule to lie to your wife?

1070
01:10:30,435 --> 01:10:31,685
I didn't lie.

1071
01:10:31,853 --> 01:10:34,855
When you called your wife,
did you tell her that...

1072
01:10:35,023 --> 01:10:37,524
...Ms. Johnson was a former lover of yours?

1073
01:10:37,692 --> 01:10:38,734
No.

1074
01:10:38,902 --> 01:10:41,570
When you got home,
did you tell her what happened?

1075
01:10:43,031 --> 01:10:45,240
No, I was hoping it would go away.

1076
01:10:45,408 --> 01:10:47,326
You hoped you'd get away with it?

1077
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:48,827
Mr. Heller.

1078
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:53,415
Do not debunk the illusion that this
dispute might be settled amicably.

1079
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:57,753
That's okay. I have no further questions.

1080
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:05,719
I asked to see family pictures.
I thought if we put it on that basis...

1081
01:11:05,887 --> 01:11:08,221
...it would be clear
things had changed between us.

1082
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:10,599
Mr. Sanders, do you have those pictures now?

1083
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:12,935
I'd like to Xerox them for the file.

1084
01:11:13,227 --> 01:11:14,978
You can continue.

1085
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:20,233
He remarked his wife hadn't lost
all the weight gained from having children.

1086
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:22,361
I said his children were beautiful...

1087
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:24,571
...he said they made him feel old...

1088
01:11:24,739 --> 01:11:28,617
...and seeing me reminded him
of what it was like to be young...

1089
01:11:28,785 --> 01:11:31,119
...and that marriage was a tough trade-off.

1090
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:32,704
Go on.

1091
01:11:33,581 --> 01:11:36,792
My assistant, Mrs. Ross, came in
and asked if she could go home.

1092
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:39,086
I wanted her to stay, but I felt guilty.

1093
01:11:39,253 --> 01:11:42,255
I'd been keeping her late for weeks
preparing for my new job.

1094
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:45,092
And, uh, where was Mr. Sanders at that point?

1095
01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:47,636
He began to rub my shoulders.

1096
01:11:49,931 --> 01:11:51,598
And you let him?

1097
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:53,558
Well, it was awkward...

1098
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:57,270
...but I thought we'd finish our discussion
and leave it at that.

1099
01:11:57,438 --> 01:11:59,272
Is that when he tried to kiss you?

1100
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:03,110
No, I got a call from Mr. Garvin
and then I came back to Tom...

1101
01:12:03,277 --> 01:12:06,905
...and told him that was it,
and then he began to kiss me.

1102
01:12:07,073 --> 01:12:08,365
Did you try to stop him?

1103
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:13,203
Yes. I struggled with him
and told him to stop. But he didn't.

1104
01:12:14,622 --> 01:12:16,832
Did he attack you physically?

1105
01:12:20,086 --> 01:12:21,128
Yes.

1106
01:12:21,796 --> 01:12:24,131
He grabbed me by my hair...

1107
01:12:24,966 --> 01:12:28,135
...and, uh, forced me down on my knees.

1108
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:31,263
And, uh....

1109
01:12:32,807 --> 01:12:34,349
He put his...

1110
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:36,727
...penis in your mouth?

1111
01:12:40,148 --> 01:12:42,232
This is making me very uncomfortable.

1112
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,859
Would you like some water?

1113
01:12:50,324 --> 01:12:51,742
Here

1114
01:12:52,326 --> 01:12:53,744
Thank you.

1115
01:13:01,335 --> 01:13:04,171
He put his, uh, penis in my mouth...

1116
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:07,883
...and said that he was going to, uh....

1117
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:12,137
To "fuck you"? Were those his words?

1118
01:13:12,305 --> 01:13:14,765
"Do you wanna get fucked?
Is that what you want?"

1119
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:17,768
And then he reached down and tore off my panties.

1120
01:13:18,853 --> 01:13:21,021
What did you do then?

1121
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:25,567
He threw me down on the scaffold
and I kneed him in the groin.

1122
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:27,486
And that was the end of it?

1123
01:13:28,154 --> 01:13:32,908
It's strange. I'd think my instinct
would be to run, but I became angry.

1124
01:13:33,076 --> 01:13:36,745
I yelled at him. Called him names.
Told him I'd kill him.

1125
01:13:36,913 --> 01:13:38,413
Just yelling.

1126
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:40,832
How did he react?

1127
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,670
He seemed to realize what he'd done.
He pulled up his pants and ran out.

1128
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:49,716
Did you call anyone afterwards?

1129
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:54,012
No. I didn't know what to do.

1130
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:58,183
I kept going over the day
in my mind, trying to figure out...

1131
01:13:58,351 --> 01:14:01,228
...if somehow this thing was my fault.

1132
01:14:03,523 --> 01:14:07,275
- You reported it the next morning?
- Yes.

1133
01:14:08,528 --> 01:14:11,738
But you didn't bring formal charges.
Why not?

1134
01:14:13,616 --> 01:14:15,367
I talked to Phil Blackburn.

1135
01:14:15,535 --> 01:14:17,619
I knew he was a friend of Tom's.

1136
01:14:17,787 --> 01:14:19,788
I didn't wanna destroy...

1137
01:14:19,956 --> 01:14:23,959
...Tom's marriage or his career,
but it's clear we couldn't work together.

1138
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:26,294
I would be too frightened.

1139
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:28,713
I'm frightened just sitting here.

1140
01:14:33,594 --> 01:14:35,137
I have nothing further.

1141
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:36,847
Ms. Alvarez.

1142
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:41,643
Ms. Johnson, I just wanna be clear on one thing.

1143
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:45,480
Mr. Sanders suggested the bottle of wine?

1144
01:14:45,648 --> 01:14:47,816
- That's right.
- But you bought it.

1145
01:14:47,984 --> 01:14:50,735
I sent my assistant Mrs. Ross
out to buy a bottle.

1146
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:52,863
- That afternoon?
- Yes.

1147
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:54,823
Did you tell her what kind?

1148
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:59,077
I said to get a nice Chardonnay.
I remembered that Tom liked white wine.

1149
01:14:59,245 --> 01:15:03,165
From those trips to Napa that he was
an amateur wine connoisseur.

1150
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:06,585
- He'd be impressed by a nice bottle?
- Yes.

1151
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:09,713
- Do you remember the wine?
- No.

1152
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:12,549
The '91 Pahlmeyer?

1153
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:14,759
Yes. That's right.

1154
01:15:14,927 --> 01:15:17,679
Do you know where your assistant got that wine?

1155
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:21,183
I assume she got it from
the liquor store down the street.

1156
01:15:21,434 --> 01:15:23,226
Would it surprise you to know...

1157
01:15:23,394 --> 01:15:26,688
...that there isn't a liquor store
in Seattle that carries that bottle?

1158
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:30,609
Mrs. Ross is very resourceful.

1159
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:32,277
Very resourceful?

1160
01:15:32,445 --> 01:15:36,281
A bottle of wine you can't find
within 500 miles of Seattle.

1161
01:15:38,034 --> 01:15:41,036
I have no idea where she got the bottle of wine.

1162
01:15:41,621 --> 01:15:46,124
Isn't it true, Ms. Johnson, that you told
Mrs. Ross three weeks ago...

1163
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:49,753
...that you wanted a bottle of '91 Pahlmeyer...

1164
01:15:49,921 --> 01:15:51,630
...for your meeting with Mr. Sanders?

1165
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:55,300
- That's not true.
- And when she couldn't find it, you said....

1166
01:15:55,468 --> 01:15:59,971
Oh, oh, what was that?
It had such managerial brio.

1167
01:16:00,223 --> 01:16:01,973
Oh, here it is. Um....

1168
01:16:02,141 --> 01:16:04,726
"If you don't find the wine...

1169
01:16:04,894 --> 01:16:06,978
...find a replacement."

1170
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:09,814
Do you have testimony from Mrs. Ross?

1171
01:16:09,982 --> 01:16:11,608
Yes, I do.

1172
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:14,527
Ms. Johnson?

1173
01:16:14,695 --> 01:16:18,156
The fact is Mrs. Ross has personal problems.

1174
01:16:18,407 --> 01:16:20,158
She has a drinking problem.

1175
01:16:20,326 --> 01:16:23,662
She tends to make up stories
to make herself seem more important.

1176
01:16:23,913 --> 01:16:27,415
I told Mrs. Ross to go buy a bottle
of wine after Tom and I spoke...

1177
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:29,334
...at the luncheon.

1178
01:16:29,502 --> 01:16:31,920
For all I know, she had that bottle at home.

1179
01:16:32,755 --> 01:16:34,589
Maybe in her wine cellar.

1180
01:16:36,884 --> 01:16:38,885
Ms. Alvarez, any more questions?

1181
01:16:39,053 --> 01:16:40,762
Mm, no, not for now.

1182
01:16:43,266 --> 01:16:45,976
I think this is a good time for a break.

1183
01:16:46,352 --> 01:16:49,938
I just got some information on Meredith.
You won't believe it, or maybe you will.

1184
01:16:51,524 --> 01:16:54,234
Alan gave me a list, we can't verify any of this.

1185
01:16:54,402 --> 01:16:56,653
- You told me you didn't have sex.
- I didn't.

1186
01:16:56,821 --> 01:16:58,989
- What about--?
- I didn't have sex with her.

1187
01:16:59,156 --> 01:17:01,825
What is it, Tom?
She's trying to quit smoking?

1188
01:17:01,993 --> 01:17:04,202
- I'm telling the truth.
- How could you do this?

1189
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:05,996
She did it. That's the point.

1190
01:17:06,205 --> 01:17:07,831
You saw this woman alone.

1191
01:17:07,999 --> 01:17:12,294
You had wine, a back rub, you kissed.
And then this non-sex sex thing.

1192
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:14,963
You took off her panties.
Those are facts.

1193
01:17:15,131 --> 01:17:16,214
So what? So what?

1194
01:17:16,382 --> 01:17:20,260
- Those don't happen unless the man wants--
- I was cornered.

1195
01:17:20,428 --> 01:17:22,512
- You let it happen!
- I did not let it happen!

1196
01:17:22,722 --> 01:17:26,308
How could you? How could you
let that woman into our lives?

1197
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:28,727
- I did not!
- Get this.

1198
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:33,148
Ten of her subordinates have transferred
in the last five years. All men.

1199
01:17:33,316 --> 01:17:35,476
- How's that for a red flag?
- Can we get hold of them?

1200
01:17:35,526 --> 01:17:37,986
Yeah, but nobody's gonna talk
and we can't subpoena them...

1201
01:17:38,154 --> 01:17:40,488
- ...because this is just a mediation.
- Aw, damn it.

1202
01:17:42,992 --> 01:17:46,578
- Do you wanna have lunch?
- I gotta go back to the office.

1203
01:17:48,122 --> 01:17:50,790
How about you, Mrs. Sanders?
Are you hungry?

1204
01:17:52,251 --> 01:17:53,710
Yeah.

1205
01:17:54,754 --> 01:17:58,256
- How are you holding up?
- Are you married?

1206
01:17:58,424 --> 01:18:00,508
Chandler, Hogue and Alvarez.

1207
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:03,261
- I married Chandler.
- You married your boss?

1208
01:18:03,429 --> 01:18:07,390
Classic case of sexual harassment. He
asked me out five times before I said yes.

1209
01:18:07,558 --> 01:18:11,644
Today, if I had said no once,
he would have been afraid to ask again.

1210
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:15,398
- Tom tells me you're a lawyer.
- Ten years.

1211
01:18:15,566 --> 01:18:19,903
- Wanna switch hats, tell me what you think?
- I don't look good in hats.

1212
01:18:20,071 --> 01:18:22,739
You're afraid she's telling the truth.

1213
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:25,200
Yes.

1214
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:28,370
What he did, he did out of weakness.

1215
01:18:28,579 --> 01:18:30,580
Hardly makes it better, does it?

1216
01:18:30,873 --> 01:18:34,876
I can't get in the middle
of your relationship with Tom...

1217
01:18:35,044 --> 01:18:39,089
...but the fact is she broke the law,
and that makes the difference.

1218
01:18:39,298 --> 01:18:44,302
Ms. Alvarez, 48 hours ago, my husband's
penis was in another woman's mouth.

1219
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:48,473
There's nothing in the law
that's gonna help me deal with that.

1220
01:18:53,312 --> 01:18:57,023
- How long you had these?
- Came in an hour ago.

1221
01:18:57,983 --> 01:19:03,154
Garvin had me send the Corridor to the Four
Seasons for the Conley people to play with.

1222
01:19:03,322 --> 01:19:04,364
It's in the hotel?

1223
01:19:04,532 --> 01:19:07,826
Yeah. The Conley people
had such fun with it yesterday....

1224
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:10,745
Getting anywhere with the drives?
I'm counting on you.

1225
01:19:10,913 --> 01:19:13,123
- I have a hunch.
- What is it?

1226
01:19:13,332 --> 01:19:15,083
- I don't know.
- What is it?

1227
01:19:15,251 --> 01:19:17,043
I don't know.

1228
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:21,256
She got to you, didn't she?

1229
01:19:22,925 --> 01:19:27,345
What do you expect? They're stronger,
they're smarter and they don't fight fair.

1230
01:19:27,513 --> 01:19:30,432
It's the next step in human evolution.
Like the Amazons.

1231
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:33,143
Keep some of us for sperm and kill the rest.

1232
01:19:33,352 --> 01:19:35,019
What do you have?

1233
01:19:36,272 --> 01:19:40,150
If I know something for a fact,
I won't withhold it.

1234
01:19:40,359 --> 01:19:43,945
But I can't go out on a limb,
it's too intense around here.

1235
01:19:44,947 --> 01:19:49,701
I'm 23. I can't wake up tomorrow and
find I'm out of the computer business.

1236
01:19:58,169 --> 01:19:59,961
Why aren't you at the mediation?

1237
01:20:00,129 --> 01:20:04,674
I just came back to, uh.... This was
the last thing I needed this week.

1238
01:20:04,884 --> 01:20:06,509
Come in.

1239
01:20:08,888 --> 01:20:10,972
The situation you're in, something's come up.

1240
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:14,184
I need to know exactly what happened that night.

1241
01:20:14,393 --> 01:20:17,479
Well, it's exactly like I told Phil.

1242
01:20:17,771 --> 01:20:19,981
You're not talking to Phil.

1243
01:20:21,108 --> 01:20:26,529
We got ahold of Sanders' phone records.
It's possible somebody overheard you two.

1244
01:20:36,123 --> 01:20:37,963
John Levin called again.

1245
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:40,460
Find out what it's about.

1246
01:20:40,628 --> 01:20:43,254
He said he had to talk to you personally.

1247
01:20:44,131 --> 01:20:46,174
I don't wanna talk to him now.

1248
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:49,719
Tom, could I talk to you?

1249
01:20:53,307 --> 01:20:54,432
Cindy...

1250
01:20:55,142 --> 01:20:56,851
...are you "a friend"?

1251
01:20:59,230 --> 01:21:00,813
A friend?

1252
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,649
You know...

1253
01:21:03,108 --> 01:21:05,485
... "a friend."  A friend.

1254
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:09,572
I depends on what you mean by "a friend."

1255
01:21:13,452 --> 01:21:14,953
All right, never mind.

1256
01:21:48,779 --> 01:21:51,197
He's heading for the elevator now.

1257
01:22:07,881 --> 01:22:10,049
Heading back to the mediation?

1258
01:22:10,217 --> 01:22:13,011
- Yeah, I gotta get back.
- I'll give you a lift.

1259
01:22:14,388 --> 01:22:17,056
Don't you think it's time we talked?

1260
01:22:25,399 --> 01:22:29,027
I understand you both had
a chance to get it off your chest.

1261
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:32,030
Your version of what happened.
Now I want it to stop.

1262
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:35,033
What I got off my chest was not a version.

1263
01:22:35,326 --> 01:22:39,245
It's always somebody's version.
That's the legacy of the modern age.

1264
01:22:39,413 --> 01:22:43,750
We have information but no truth.
Flashes of electrons in a grain of sand.

1265
01:22:43,917 --> 01:22:45,543
I'm telling the truth.

1266
01:22:46,086 --> 01:22:49,756
- You gotta look at this from all sides.
- How many sides are there?

1267
01:22:50,591 --> 01:22:53,635
All right, let's say she made a mistake.
So what?

1268
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:56,054
She made a pass, that's all.
Put her hand on you.

1269
01:22:56,221 --> 01:22:59,766
You could have decided it was flattering.
You could've taken it off.

1270
01:22:59,933 --> 01:23:03,811
You could have handled it many ways,
but this vindictiveness...

1271
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:07,774
- ...I have to tell you, I'm surprised.
- It's against the law. I'm employed by her.

1272
01:23:07,941 --> 01:23:11,110
- I work for her.
- No. You work for me.

1273
01:23:11,278 --> 01:23:13,196
That's what I'm saying.

1274
01:23:13,364 --> 01:23:18,284
After all these years, why didn't you
come to me? Not go hire this lawyer.

1275
01:23:18,452 --> 01:23:19,786
Maybe I should have.

1276
01:23:19,953 --> 01:23:22,622
I mean, why can't you just forget it?

1277
01:23:22,790 --> 01:23:26,584
Work together like adults and
everyone makes a pile of money.

1278
01:23:26,752 --> 01:23:29,212
- What's wrong with that?
- Things have gone too far.

1279
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:31,464
Things can go back.

1280
01:23:32,925 --> 01:23:35,009
Why would he offer to settle now?

1281
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:37,428
He realized how much they got to lose.

1282
01:23:37,596 --> 01:23:39,597
No, he had us on the run.
It doesn't add up.

1283
01:23:39,765 --> 01:23:42,975
Maybe there's a vulnerability
we don't know about.

1284
01:23:43,769 --> 01:23:48,189
I'm still getting messages from "a friend."
I printed out the address.

1285
01:23:48,357 --> 01:23:50,775
Maybe your investigators can check it out.

1286
01:23:51,443 --> 01:23:54,946
I hope the company doesn't find him first.
Remember the cleaning lady?

1287
01:23:55,114 --> 01:23:56,739
- Yeah.
- She's out of town.

1288
01:23:56,907 --> 01:23:59,033
No one knows where or when she's coming back.

1289
01:23:59,284 --> 01:24:02,537
The Bahamas, probably, with Mrs. Ross
on the next plane to join her.

1290
01:24:02,788 --> 01:24:05,123
These guys play hardball, Tom.

1291
01:24:55,174 --> 01:24:59,677
Did Mr. Sanders ever touch you in a way
that makes you feel uncomfortable?

1292
01:24:59,845 --> 01:25:01,345
I don't think he's aware of it.

1293
01:25:01,513 --> 01:25:03,681
Just answer the question, please.

1294
01:25:04,433 --> 01:25:06,684
- Yes.
- How does he touch you?

1295
01:25:07,811 --> 01:25:11,856
He'll pat me on my behind or
rub my shoulders while I'm at my desk.

1296
01:25:12,024 --> 01:25:13,733
Rub your shoulders?

1297
01:25:13,901 --> 01:25:16,027
I don't think he means anything by it.

1298
01:25:16,195 --> 01:25:17,445
You don't like it.

1299
01:25:18,447 --> 01:25:20,406
I just feel it's inappropriate.

1300
01:25:20,574 --> 01:25:22,867
I'm not sure I see the relevance of this.

1301
01:25:23,035 --> 01:25:25,870
We're trying to establish a pattern of behavior.

1302
01:25:26,038 --> 01:25:29,040
Sexual harassers generally follow a pattern.

1303
01:25:29,333 --> 01:25:31,375
- I'll allow it.
- Thank you.

1304
01:25:32,336 --> 01:25:34,337
You don't have any chiropractic problems?

1305
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:37,673
Any neck problems, or your back?

1306
01:25:37,841 --> 01:25:38,883
No.

1307
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:42,970
So you would characterize
this behavior as flirting...

1308
01:25:43,222 --> 01:25:44,514
...or sexual?

1309
01:25:46,141 --> 01:25:48,851
- I suppose so.
- But you never said anything.

1310
01:25:49,228 --> 01:25:51,687
- He's my boss.
- You didn't report it?

1311
01:25:51,855 --> 01:25:53,272
No.

1312
01:25:53,649 --> 01:25:55,733
He's your boss. I understand.

1313
01:25:55,901 --> 01:25:58,152
Your job is at stake. Rumors.

1314
01:25:58,362 --> 01:26:00,363
Whether people would even believe you.

1315
01:26:00,656 --> 01:26:05,576
And if I asked you if you ever had any
sexual relations with Mr. Sanders...

1316
01:26:05,744 --> 01:26:06,994
...same answer?

1317
01:26:07,871 --> 01:26:10,206
- No, I didn't.
- Didn't report it?

1318
01:26:10,791 --> 01:26:13,292
- It never happened.
- I understand.

1319
01:26:13,710 --> 01:26:16,087
I have no further questions.

1320
01:26:16,797 --> 01:26:18,047
Barbara called...

1321
01:26:18,257 --> 01:26:21,467
- ...about the Disneyland tickets for...?
- Jafar.

1322
01:26:21,635 --> 01:26:25,137
He's got the tickets,
and an upgrade at the hotel.

1323
01:26:25,305 --> 01:26:27,723
Thank you, I appreciate it.

1324
01:26:29,309 --> 01:26:31,561
They gave me your wallet photos.

1325
01:26:35,399 --> 01:26:38,484
- I'll see you later?
- Yeah, I'll see you later.

1326
01:26:38,652 --> 01:26:45,616
Bye.

1327
01:27:18,609 --> 01:27:22,695
You know, it's funny how you always
assumed it'd be you who got the job.

1328
01:27:22,863 --> 01:27:25,031
Lewyn assumed it would be him or you.

1329
01:27:25,782 --> 01:27:29,994
But nobody ever thought for a second
it might be me.

1330
01:27:30,162 --> 01:27:31,662
Isn't that funny?

1331
01:27:32,497 --> 01:27:35,458
That's not true.
You were always on the list.

1332
01:27:35,626 --> 01:27:36,709
Really?

1333
01:27:36,877 --> 01:27:40,880
Let me guess: "Hunter,
not someone you'd follow into battle.

1334
01:27:41,298 --> 01:27:43,966
Too much of a team player.
No killer instinct.

1335
01:27:44,134 --> 01:27:46,052
Doesn't have those tools."

1336
01:27:46,219 --> 01:27:47,762
What is that all a code for?

1337
01:27:47,930 --> 01:27:50,473
What are you saying, Hunter?
You on Meredith's side?

1338
01:27:52,643 --> 01:27:55,645
I studied engineering for eight years.

1339
01:27:55,812 --> 01:27:59,482
I was the only woman in that department.
You know what I did?

1340
01:27:59,816 --> 01:28:02,652
I worked.
You think I'm on Meredith's side?

1341
01:28:07,407 --> 01:28:09,158
What do you wanna do?

1342
01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:11,160
Hmm, what?

1343
01:28:11,745 --> 01:28:15,998
Their offer ends midnight. It's what
Garvin told you. You get your job back.

1344
01:28:16,166 --> 01:28:19,919
She's your boss.
Everybody goes back to work.

1345
01:28:21,672 --> 01:28:23,047
Did you find "a friend"?

1346
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:25,216
- Did we get the address from internet?
- Oh, yeah.

1347
01:28:25,384 --> 01:28:29,428
Dr. Arthur Friend, a chemistry professor
from the University of Washington...

1348
01:28:29,596 --> 01:28:32,431
...who's been in Nepal the last three weeks.

1349
01:28:32,599 --> 01:28:34,934
You got messages from a locked office.

1350
01:28:35,769 --> 01:28:38,020
I'm glad we got that one solved.

1351
01:28:38,522 --> 01:28:40,690
Shit, I have to call Lewyn.

1352
01:28:41,358 --> 01:28:44,276
The drives we're having problems with came in.

1353
01:28:44,444 --> 01:28:46,445
- Only you, Sanders.
- What?

1354
01:28:46,613 --> 01:28:51,075
Anybody else would be sabotaging
the company, not solving their problems.

1355
01:28:51,243 --> 01:28:52,803
It's Adele and Mark.

1356
01:28:52,953 --> 01:28:56,455
We're not home, leave your name
and number, and we'll call you back.

1357
01:28:59,543 --> 01:29:00,876
What?

1358
01:29:01,211 --> 01:29:06,298
That's Mark's wife's voice on the machine,
but on Monday it was a man's voice.

1359
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:10,511
Then the next day, Mark said
he never got the message.

1360
01:29:16,476 --> 01:29:18,811
I dialed the wrong number that night.

1361
01:29:19,730 --> 01:29:20,896
So?

1362
01:29:23,734 --> 01:29:26,068
That's why the battery was dead.

1363
01:29:26,236 --> 01:29:28,154
Tom, what are you talking about?

1364
01:29:33,910 --> 01:29:37,413
That's why Garvin wants to deal.
He's got my phone records.

1365
01:29:37,581 --> 01:29:40,916
I've got a 10-minute phone bill
the same time I'm in Meredith's office.

1366
01:29:41,084 --> 01:29:44,837
She yanked the phone away.
I called the wrong number...

1367
01:29:45,005 --> 01:29:48,340
...but I never hung up the phone.
The phone line is open.

1368
01:29:50,343 --> 01:29:53,763
Somebody out there's got this whole
thing on an answering machine.

1369
01:30:02,022 --> 01:30:04,774
It's Levin, not Lewyn.

1370
01:30:05,025 --> 01:30:07,318
- Hey, John!
- What's going on?

1371
01:30:07,486 --> 01:30:11,447
I've been getting phone calls.
Some creep has my Visa...

1372
01:30:11,615 --> 01:30:14,533
...then, at the office,
everything's turned upside down.

1373
01:30:14,701 --> 01:30:17,119
- My files--
- Have they got the tape?

1374
01:30:17,287 --> 01:30:20,539
What I'm saying is,
it's a good thing I brought it home.

1375
01:30:20,707 --> 01:30:24,126
- I listened to it with my girlfriend.
- Where's the tape?

1376
01:30:26,713 --> 01:30:28,047
It's all here?

1377
01:30:29,216 --> 01:30:32,968
I've been trying to get a hold of you
all week! What do I gotta do?

1378
01:30:33,136 --> 01:30:34,720
You know what this means?

1379
01:30:35,055 --> 01:30:37,723
Do you have any idea what this means?

1380
01:30:38,308 --> 01:30:39,850
Thanks, pal.

1381
01:30:52,197 --> 01:30:54,573
No deal. No, no deal, Catherine.

1382
01:30:54,741 --> 01:30:58,077
We're gonna bury them.
Everything is on tape.

1383
01:30:58,411 --> 01:31:00,079
Yes, everything.

1384
01:31:32,362 --> 01:31:33,779
Put it in.

1385
01:31:38,285 --> 01:31:39,952
God, look at us.

1386
01:31:40,453 --> 01:31:42,246
I want you inside me.

1387
01:31:44,166 --> 01:31:45,207
I can't do this.

1388
01:31:45,375 --> 01:31:47,293
- Put it in.
- I'm not gonna do this.

1389
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:49,920
- Now! Come on, now!
- No, no!

1390
01:31:50,088 --> 01:31:52,590
- You can’t just stop!
- No!

1391
01:31:52,966 --> 01:31:55,426
No! Goddamn it!

1392
01:32:04,769 --> 01:32:08,439
You stick your dick in my mouth
then you get an attack of morality?

1393
01:32:11,318 --> 01:32:13,569
This never happened. All right?

1394
01:32:14,321 --> 01:32:17,323
You never used to be this way.

1395
01:32:18,742 --> 01:32:22,286
We believe in any judicial proceeding,
this tape would be inadmissible.

1396
01:32:22,454 --> 01:32:26,081
Inadmissible? I'm worried I'm gonna drive
to work and hear it on Howard Stern.

1397
01:32:26,249 --> 01:32:27,875
Is she threatening to release this?

1398
01:32:28,043 --> 01:32:30,669
I don't know how many copies
of this tape there are.

1399
01:32:30,837 --> 01:32:33,422
I didn't put it out there.
I hate publicity.

1400
01:32:33,590 --> 01:32:38,135
Young lady, this tape demonstrates
consensual sex between two adults...

1401
01:32:38,845 --> 01:32:41,513
...however it may have
appeared the morning after.

1402
01:32:41,765 --> 01:32:44,767
Mr. Sanders' regret
is not my client's harassment.

1403
01:32:45,143 --> 01:32:47,770
Ms. Johnson, is that your position today?

1404
01:32:48,230 --> 01:32:49,313
Yes, it is.

1405
01:32:50,273 --> 01:32:51,398
Ms. Alvarez?

1406
01:32:51,816 --> 01:32:55,527
Ms. Johnson, just so I'm clear
on what today's story is...

1407
01:32:55,779 --> 01:32:58,989
...would you define for me "consensual sex"?

1408
01:32:59,157 --> 01:33:02,201
Sex where both parties are willing participants.

1409
01:33:02,494 --> 01:33:05,788
How many times did we hear
Mr. Sanders say "no" on that tape?

1410
01:33:06,373 --> 01:33:09,875
I don't know, I was too busy listening
to my underwear being torn off.

1411
01:33:10,168 --> 01:33:12,878
Thirty-one. Thirty-one times.

1412
01:33:13,046 --> 01:33:14,797
Doesn't no mean no?

1413
01:33:15,507 --> 01:33:19,843
Sometimes "no" means that person
wants to be overwhelmed, dominated.

1414
01:33:20,011 --> 01:33:24,390
The way we're supposed to have sex
nowadays, we'd need the UN to supervise.

1415
01:33:24,557 --> 01:33:26,684
No means no.

1416
01:33:26,851 --> 01:33:28,894
Isn't that what we tell women?

1417
01:33:29,312 --> 01:33:31,313
Do men deserve less?

1418
01:33:32,190 --> 01:33:35,901
When he really wanted to stop
he didn't seem to have problems doing it.

1419
01:33:36,069 --> 01:33:37,429
That's when you got angry.

1420
01:33:37,570 --> 01:33:39,697
Of course I did. So would anyone.

1421
01:33:39,864 --> 01:33:41,907
Don't we tell women they can stop at any point?

1422
01:33:42,075 --> 01:33:44,535
Haven't you ever said no and meant yes?

1423
01:33:44,703 --> 01:33:47,162
Up until the moment of actual penetration--

1424
01:33:47,330 --> 01:33:50,624
The point is, he was willing.
That tape doesn't change anything.

1425
01:33:50,834 --> 01:33:55,629
The point is, you controlled the meeting.
You set the time, you ordered the wine.

1426
01:33:55,797 --> 01:33:56,839
You locked the door.

1427
01:33:57,007 --> 01:33:59,842
You demanded service
and got angry when he didn't provide it.

1428
01:34:00,010 --> 01:34:04,346
So you decided to get even, to get
rid of him with this trumped-up charge.

1429
01:34:04,514 --> 01:34:08,434
Ms. Johnson, the only thing you have
proven is that a woman in power...

1430
01:34:08,601 --> 01:34:11,395
...can be every bit as abusive as a man.

1431
01:34:11,563 --> 01:34:15,190
You wanna put me on trial?
Let's be honest about what it's for.

1432
01:34:15,358 --> 01:34:17,818
I am sexually aggressive. I like it.

1433
01:34:17,986 --> 01:34:20,112
Tom knew it and you can't handle it.

1434
01:34:20,363 --> 01:34:23,032
It is the same thing since the beginning of time.

1435
01:34:23,199 --> 01:34:26,327
Veil it, hide it, lock it up
and throw away the key.

1436
01:34:26,494 --> 01:34:29,204
We expect a woman to do a man's job,
make a man's money...

1437
01:34:29,372 --> 01:34:33,334
...then lie down for a man to fuck her
like it was still 100 years ago.

1438
01:34:33,501 --> 01:34:35,544
Well, no, thank you.

1439
01:34:41,968 --> 01:34:47,056
Well, you are not gonna believe this.
I think the Howard Stern thing got to them.

1440
01:34:47,223 --> 01:34:49,516
- What did Phil say?
- You get your job back.

1441
01:34:49,684 --> 01:34:53,103
You get 100 grand in pain and suffering,
and I get fees and expenses.

1442
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:54,563
Meredith?

1443
01:34:54,731 --> 01:34:57,232
She stays through the merger,
then they announce...

1444
01:34:57,400 --> 01:35:01,487
...she has to leave for some medical--
Uh, whatever. --emergency. She's out.

1445
01:35:01,654 --> 01:35:04,490
This is total and complete vindication.

1446
01:35:04,657 --> 01:35:08,118
- Yes! Ha, ha! Yes! Whoo!
- It's over!

1447
01:35:08,286 --> 01:35:11,789
- Yes! Oh, man.
- Ha, ha.

1448
01:35:11,998 --> 01:35:13,582
Whoo!

1449
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:18,003
I almost feel sorry for him.
He has no idea, does he?

1450
01:35:26,596 --> 01:35:31,266
I'd like to read this over again before
we sign. Not that I don't trust you.

1451
01:35:31,434 --> 01:35:34,395
Just as long as it's done by midnight tonight.

1452
01:35:34,562 --> 01:35:37,022
Garvin wants this off his screen.

1453
01:35:38,066 --> 01:35:43,195
Oh, uh, Tom, we want you to make
a presentation on Arcamax...

1454
01:35:43,446 --> 01:35:45,948
...at the merger announcement tomorrow morning.

1455
01:35:46,116 --> 01:35:49,410
- Nothing technical, three or four minutes.
- Fine. No problem.

1456
01:35:49,577 --> 01:35:50,786
Great.

1457
01:35:50,954 --> 01:35:54,832
Now I've gotta go upstairs and
break it to her. It won't be easy.

1458
01:35:54,999 --> 01:35:57,543
I thought you enjoyed that kind of thing.

1459
01:35:57,710 --> 01:36:01,130
You go after one of our people,
we'll put the wagons in a circle.

1460
01:36:01,297 --> 01:36:05,259
Once you made your case,
the company behaved appropriately.

1461
01:36:05,427 --> 01:36:06,468
Wouldn't you say so?

1462
01:36:06,636 --> 01:36:09,263
- You don't wanna know what I think.
- It's terrible.

1463
01:36:09,431 --> 01:36:13,851
The way a thing like this
can tear a company apart.

1464
01:36:14,018 --> 01:36:17,604
I told Bob we really need to take a look at it.

1465
01:36:17,772 --> 01:36:20,023
Hey, friends?

1466
01:36:22,777 --> 01:36:27,698
- What?
- I hope you still think of me as a friend.

1467
01:36:29,033 --> 01:36:30,742
Good night, Phil.

1468
01:36:33,955 --> 01:36:36,290
Sign it now and I'll read it over later.

1469
01:36:36,958 --> 01:36:38,292
Where will you be?

1470
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:40,752
Here, getting that presentation together.

1471
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:44,631
If not, I'll have somebody
run this by your house later.

1472
01:36:52,223 --> 01:36:54,433
- Let me ask you something.
- What?

1473
01:36:54,601 --> 01:36:56,894
- Why do you think Meredith did this?
- What?

1474
01:36:57,061 --> 01:37:00,564
You've seen her in action.
She's cool, smart, always in control.

1475
01:37:00,732 --> 01:37:03,984
- How could she have lost control like this?
- I don't know.

1476
01:37:04,235 --> 01:37:06,320
You're attractive. Maybe.

1477
01:37:06,488 --> 01:37:10,407
- But you are not irresistible.
- I'm serious. She's here one day.

1478
01:37:10,575 --> 01:37:13,660
There's a merger going on.
Conley people are touchy.

1479
01:37:13,828 --> 01:37:15,412
She thought you'd go along.

1480
01:37:15,580 --> 01:37:17,581
- There's more to it than that.
- Come on.

1481
01:37:17,749 --> 01:37:20,584
You think too much.
You need to go home...

1482
01:37:20,752 --> 01:37:23,170
...open a nice bottle of champagne...

1483
01:37:23,338 --> 01:37:26,507
...make up with your wife, and get some sleep.

1484
01:37:26,674 --> 01:37:28,467
It's over.

1485
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:31,970
Thank you, Catherine.

1486
01:37:32,138 --> 01:37:34,515
Absolutely. You're welcome.

1487
01:37:35,058 --> 01:37:37,518
- Have a good night.
- Good night.

1488
01:38:06,923 --> 01:38:08,173
Hi, Stephanie.

1489
01:38:08,341 --> 01:38:11,718
Must be difficult, so much going on,
and nobody giving you information.

1490
01:38:11,886 --> 01:38:13,762
It's been a crazy week.

1491
01:38:14,347 --> 01:38:18,350
I had a friend. She was one
of the first women to move high up.

1492
01:38:18,685 --> 01:38:21,895
You know what it's like,
every day putting out fires.

1493
01:38:22,063 --> 01:38:25,190
It turned out the job wasn't
anything she thought it was.

1494
01:38:25,358 --> 01:38:28,360
She was looking the wrong way
when they fired her.

1495
01:38:29,070 --> 01:38:33,615
- Interesting.
- Mm. Truth usually is, once you get to it.

1496
01:38:50,758 --> 01:38:54,344
- Ah. It's you, Mr. Sanders.
- Where'd everybody go?

1497
01:38:54,512 --> 01:38:58,181
Mr. Garvin came in an hour ago.
Said they were working too hard.

1498
01:38:58,349 --> 01:38:59,808
Sent everybody home.

1499
01:40:00,244 --> 01:40:02,044
What if Sanders doesn't bring it up?

1500
01:40:02,205 --> 01:40:03,285
He will, he will.

1501
01:40:03,414 --> 01:40:06,166
I talked to him about his
presentation on Arcamax.

1502
01:40:06,334 --> 01:40:07,793
He has no idea.

1503
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:09,628
When he brings up the line....

1504
01:40:09,796 --> 01:40:12,547
You gotta pounce, because we
don't have the harassment.

1505
01:40:12,715 --> 01:40:16,802
It's gotta be that Sanders
is incompetent. Uh-huh?

1506
01:40:16,969 --> 01:40:19,554
It'll be in public. With reporters.

1507
01:40:19,889 --> 01:40:21,682
Bob's counting on you.

1508
01:40:21,974 --> 01:40:24,309
We gotta clean out the database, just in case.

1509
01:40:24,477 --> 01:40:25,519
And any backup.

1510
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:35,070
Sanders.
Catherine, can you hold on one minute?

1511
01:40:38,616 --> 01:40:40,909
Do we wanna talk about--?

1512
01:40:41,077 --> 01:40:43,662
Catherine, has my contract gone out already?

1513
01:40:43,830 --> 01:40:45,205
Shit.

1514
01:40:45,748 --> 01:40:48,250
What does the contract say about firing me?

1515
01:40:48,418 --> 01:40:51,461
They can fire me for cause, can't they?
For incompetence?

1516
01:40:52,422 --> 01:40:56,466
The problem with the drives is not
with the programming or the design.

1517
01:40:56,718 --> 01:41:00,303
It's with the production line,
and that's my responsibility.

1518
01:41:00,763 --> 01:41:02,472
This whole thing tomorrow...

1519
01:41:02,807 --> 01:41:04,725
...they're setting me up.

1520
01:42:15,671 --> 01:42:17,923
Housekeeping, please.

1521
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:21,259
Yes. This is Mr. Conley.

1522
01:42:21,427 --> 01:42:24,012
Could someone come up
and turn down my bed please?

1523
01:42:24,514 --> 01:42:28,099
Uh, my room number?
It's on the phone here somewhere....

1524
01:42:28,267 --> 01:42:30,769
Yeah, that's right.

1525
01:42:30,937 --> 01:42:33,021
Thank you very much.

1526
01:42:39,403 --> 01:42:41,488
- When does your dad arrive?
- Midnight.

1527
01:42:41,656 --> 01:42:43,698
They had to stop in Houston.

1528
01:42:43,866 --> 01:42:46,701
I'd love for him to get a chance
to see the Corridor.

1529
01:42:47,203 --> 01:42:48,328
You know...

1530
01:42:48,704 --> 01:42:53,208
...I stayed up late last night,
fooling around with it up in my room.

1531
01:42:53,584 --> 01:42:55,085
It's really incredible.

1532
01:43:00,842 --> 01:43:03,301
- Aah!
- I'm sorry, sir.

1533
01:43:03,469 --> 01:43:04,928
Here, thank you.

1534
01:43:05,096 --> 01:43:06,555
- You're welcome.
- Good night.

1535
01:43:06,722 --> 01:43:08,348
Have a nice evening.

1536
01:44:25,217 --> 01:44:27,510
You have accessed DigiCom's Corridor...

1537
01:44:27,678 --> 01:44:30,096
...our prototype for a virtual reality database.

1538
01:44:30,264 --> 01:44:32,182
Enjoy the demonstration.

1539
01:44:32,433 --> 01:44:37,354
Information accessed during this demo
is for entertainment value only...

1540
01:44:37,521 --> 01:44:40,649
...and should not be duplicated
to another database.

1541
01:44:40,816 --> 01:44:44,235
If you have any questions, please ask the angel.

1542
01:45:35,746 --> 01:45:38,248
Malaysian Operations.

1543
01:46:17,496 --> 01:46:21,291
Searching Malaysian revisions file.

1544
01:46:21,459 --> 01:46:23,835
Why don't we go up to my suite?

1545
01:46:24,879 --> 01:46:27,881
Give my colleagues here
a chance to try out the Corridor.

1546
01:46:28,841 --> 01:46:30,216
Good idea.

1547
01:46:57,411 --> 01:47:00,830
"Reduction of air handling capacity
from number 7 air handlers...

1548
01:47:01,082 --> 01:47:04,084
...to a more appropriate
and cost-effective number 5."

1549
01:47:04,418 --> 01:47:09,005
You can't put number 5 handlers in there.
You'll have dirt getting in everything.

1550
01:47:09,173 --> 01:47:10,673
Aah!

1551
01:47:12,093 --> 01:47:14,135
My God, she's in the system.

1552
01:47:32,696 --> 01:47:34,739
Angel, I need help.

1553
01:47:36,784 --> 01:47:38,076
Help is here.

1554
01:47:38,702 --> 01:47:41,496
Is there any way to stop these files
from being deleted?

1555
01:47:41,664 --> 01:47:43,706
I'm sorry. You're not Level 5.

1556
01:47:48,712 --> 01:47:51,381
You're supposed to protect the files.

1557
01:47:51,549 --> 01:47:54,509
Sysop controls are restricted to Level 5.

1558
01:48:14,947 --> 01:48:17,407
Show me all communications with Malaysia.

1559
01:48:17,575 --> 01:48:19,367
Telephone or video?

1560
01:48:19,660 --> 01:48:20,994
Video.

1561
01:48:32,923 --> 01:48:36,885
Show me, uh, the last transmission
involving Meredith.

1562
01:48:43,350 --> 01:48:47,187
It's only a matter of time before Tom
figures out about the changes at the plant.

1563
01:48:47,354 --> 01:48:48,438
He's not stupid.

1564
01:48:48,647 --> 01:48:51,524
Tom will be out of the picture
by Tuesday. Trust me.

1565
01:48:51,692 --> 01:48:55,445
I don't like to gamble.
I love Tahoe, but I think the risk--

1566
01:48:55,613 --> 01:48:59,449
Think. Who'll believe him?
He's married, he has a family.

1567
01:48:59,658 --> 01:49:02,702
He'll have no choice but to take
the settlement and leave.

1568
01:49:02,870 --> 01:49:06,789
Then we say Sanders made the changes
at the plant? He'll deny it.

1569
01:49:06,957 --> 01:49:10,126
He won't know.
He'll be gone by then.

1570
01:49:32,399 --> 01:49:35,109
These things are so darn complicated.

1571
01:49:38,697 --> 01:49:40,240
You got it upside down.

1572
01:49:52,086 --> 01:49:53,544
There we go.

1573
01:50:05,432 --> 01:50:09,310
- So who's first?
- Must have left the system on.

1574
01:50:10,062 --> 01:50:13,523
Mr. Furillo, why don't you go?
You're gonna love this.

1575
01:50:13,732 --> 01:50:16,025
Sure. I'd love to try it.

1576
01:50:25,119 --> 01:50:27,245
I am totally screwed.

1577
01:50:28,122 --> 01:50:29,998
I'll make my presentation...

1578
01:50:30,165 --> 01:50:32,792
...Meredith will ask me questions.
She's gonna set me up.

1579
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:35,128
She'll make me look totally incompetent.

1580
01:50:35,296 --> 01:50:38,131
Are you sure there's not
another system somewhere?

1581
01:50:38,299 --> 01:50:40,967
The system has been completely deleted.

1582
01:50:41,135 --> 01:50:42,885
So I'm a sitting duck.

1583
01:50:43,387 --> 01:50:47,473
I'll be one of those people walking around
like a ghost with a resume.

1584
01:51:10,831 --> 01:51:12,749
- Hello.
- It's Mohammed Jafar.

1585
01:51:12,916 --> 01:51:14,417
How are you?

1586
01:51:14,585 --> 01:51:18,171
I don't mean to bug you,
but we're departing Monday--

1587
01:51:18,339 --> 01:51:22,133
No, it's my fault. Um, Susan got the
Disneyland tickets for you.

1588
01:51:22,301 --> 01:51:23,593
The e-tickets?

1589
01:51:23,761 --> 01:51:28,264
Uh, you're comped for all the rides,
and at the hotel they'll upgrade you.

1590
01:51:28,432 --> 01:51:31,017
Magnificent. I can't wait to tell my wife.

1591
01:51:31,185 --> 01:51:33,686
She didn't believe you.
She said you were full of shit.

1592
01:51:33,854 --> 01:51:36,939
- You know how women are.
- Yes, I sure do.

1593
01:51:37,358 --> 01:51:39,192
I miss your face.

1594
01:51:39,443 --> 01:51:43,446
Talk to Arthur. He sees it enough
on the DVL. I'm always--

1595
01:51:44,948 --> 01:51:48,534
Tom? Hello?

1596
01:51:48,827 --> 01:51:50,203
Tom, are you there?

1597
01:51:50,371 --> 01:51:54,791
Mohammed, on this end,
we back up our files on DAT.

1598
01:51:54,958 --> 01:51:57,210
Do you guys do the same over there?

1599
01:51:57,544 --> 01:51:59,420
I don't know what we have.

1600
01:52:00,339 --> 01:52:02,715
I'd have to check it out.
What do you have in mind?

1601
01:52:02,883 --> 01:52:06,719
I got a real problem here.
I'm up against the wall and...

1602
01:52:07,429 --> 01:52:10,932
...I need you to do some things for me, Mohammed.

1603
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:14,352
I hope we have what you need, Tom.

1604
01:52:43,382 --> 01:52:44,632
- Daddy?
- Yeah?

1605
01:52:45,384 --> 01:52:47,927
I never believed what they said about you.

1606
01:52:53,392 --> 01:52:54,892
Thank you, honey.

1607
01:52:56,437 --> 01:52:58,187
Come here, big guy.

1608
01:53:06,655 --> 01:53:08,448
Thank you.

1609
01:53:24,506 --> 01:53:25,923
Faxes from Malaysia?

1610
01:53:26,425 --> 01:53:29,510
I can't believe it's still coming out.
It started at 7.

1611
01:53:51,658 --> 01:53:52,950
Testing.

1612
01:54:11,220 --> 01:54:13,221
Put these in one of the files.

1613
01:54:38,872 --> 01:54:42,833
- Yeah, there's a real talent to fishing.
- What?

1614
01:54:43,001 --> 01:54:45,461
First you gotta choose the right bait...

1615
01:54:45,629 --> 01:54:47,880
...then you have to know when to reel it in.

1616
01:54:48,048 --> 01:54:51,384
Tom, about the other day,
I didn't mean to suggest....

1617
01:54:51,552 --> 01:54:52,760
Yes, you did.

1618
01:54:53,512 --> 01:54:57,098
I apologize, and thank you.

1619
01:54:58,392 --> 01:55:00,017
I accept.

1620
01:55:07,276 --> 01:55:09,944
Which brings us to our Advanced Products Group.

1621
01:55:10,112 --> 01:55:12,780
Tom Sanders heads our manufacturing department.

1622
01:55:12,948 --> 01:55:14,907
Tom, I wonder if you can come up here...

1623
01:55:15,075 --> 01:55:19,245
...and review for us the revolutionary
new product we call Arcamax?

1624
01:55:27,754 --> 01:55:29,797
Thank you, Meredith.

1625
01:55:31,842 --> 01:55:36,345
Arcamax is our own stand-alone
CD-ROM drive player.

1626
01:55:36,930 --> 01:55:40,725
Now, for a CD-ROM drive to be effective,
it has to be portable...

1627
01:55:40,892 --> 01:55:42,184
...it has to be fast.

1628
01:55:42,352 --> 01:55:48,024
Arcamax is twice as fast as any
CD-ROM drive in the world today.

1629
01:55:48,191 --> 01:55:51,277
In production, we've had our problems,
but we are solving them.

1630
01:55:51,445 --> 01:55:54,113
The problems, are they design problems?

1631
01:55:54,281 --> 01:55:58,326
No, they were fabrication problems
involving the production line.

1632
01:55:58,493 --> 01:55:59,910
What sort of problems?

1633
01:56:00,579 --> 01:56:04,790
Well, for example, we should be using
automatic chip installers to lock...

1634
01:56:04,958 --> 01:56:06,959
...the control chip on the board.

1635
01:56:07,127 --> 01:56:09,629
The Malaysians have been doing it by hand...

1636
01:56:09,796 --> 01:56:12,298
...literally jamming the chips
in with their thumbs.

1637
01:56:12,466 --> 01:56:14,967
And the quality of the air is dirty.

1638
01:56:15,135 --> 01:56:19,138
We should use level 7 air handlers,
we're using only level 5.

1639
01:56:19,306 --> 01:56:21,182
And, uh, we're ordering our components...

1640
01:56:21,350 --> 01:56:26,354
...like hinge rods and clips,
not from our Singapore supplier...

1641
01:56:26,521 --> 01:56:30,858
...but from someone who's a lot cheaper,
but also less reliable.

1642
01:56:31,109 --> 01:56:35,571
I'm confused. You set up this line.
You didn't anticipate these problems?

1643
01:56:36,448 --> 01:56:40,785
The line was changed.
The specifications were altered.

1644
01:56:40,952 --> 01:56:44,538
How is that possible?
We know you to be a competent manager.

1645
01:56:46,375 --> 01:56:50,252
Well, you should know, Meredith.
You ordered the changes.

1646
01:56:51,129 --> 01:56:53,589
I don't know where you could've got that idea.

1647
01:56:53,757 --> 01:56:56,258
Weren't you in Kuala Lumpur last year?

1648
01:56:58,053 --> 01:57:02,139
To settle a labor dispute.
I've never even seen the line.

1649
01:57:04,643 --> 01:57:07,853
- You've never seen the line?
- No, I don't know who told you such a--

1650
01:57:13,694 --> 01:57:16,362
You're watching Malaysian Channel 3.

1651
01:57:22,160 --> 01:57:24,829
Perhaps instead of digging up
Malaysian video clips...

1652
01:57:24,996 --> 01:57:27,498
...we should discuss
the problems in front of us...

1653
01:57:27,666 --> 01:57:30,751
...the problems in your department
with the line you set up.

1654
01:57:31,753 --> 01:57:33,379
All right.

1655
01:57:38,677 --> 01:57:43,347
The first memo in the file being handed
out is signed by Meredith Johnson.

1656
01:57:43,515 --> 01:57:47,518
It states that manual labor
will be used to install the chips.

1657
01:57:47,686 --> 01:57:50,396
That made the Malaysian government happy.

1658
01:57:50,564 --> 01:57:54,150
It also meant voltage irregularities
and memory allocation--

1659
01:57:54,317 --> 01:57:57,445
That was a complex negotiation.
The Malay government insisted--

1660
01:57:57,612 --> 01:58:01,782
The Malaysian government
does not own shares of DigiCom.

1661
01:58:01,950 --> 01:58:03,826
These people here do.

1662
01:58:05,704 --> 01:58:07,371
The second memo...

1663
01:58:07,539 --> 01:58:11,584
...reduces the air handling capacity
in order to cut costs.

1664
01:58:11,752 --> 01:58:16,922
And that's why we're getting dirt in the
split optics, the drive arms, the chip joints.

1665
01:58:17,090 --> 01:58:22,219
The resulting delays will actually
increase the costs by more than 70%..

1666
01:58:22,387 --> 01:58:26,307
- The third memo regarding--
- The drives were your responsibility!

1667
01:58:27,142 --> 01:58:30,227
These problems were created
because of your incompetence, not mine.

1668
01:58:30,395 --> 01:58:32,188
That's the problem with this division!

1669
01:58:32,355 --> 01:58:34,440
- Passing the buck, back stabbing.
- Meredith--

1670
01:58:34,608 --> 01:58:35,649
I'm not through.

1671
01:58:35,817 --> 01:58:38,486
This so-called evidence of yours
is fooling no one!

1672
01:58:38,737 --> 01:58:42,740
You can showboat and protect your turf
and think it means something.

1673
01:58:42,908 --> 01:58:46,243
You weren't told of these decisions,
because they're over your head.

1674
01:58:46,411 --> 01:58:48,954
This merger is about a synergy...

1675
01:58:49,122 --> 01:58:52,416
...between hardware and software,
between cash flow and capital needs.

1676
01:58:52,584 --> 01:58:56,587
- That's a language you can't understand!
- I don't understand it either.

1677
01:58:57,297 --> 01:59:00,382
We were buying this company
because they could build things.

1678
01:59:01,092 --> 01:59:03,677
You understand what the heck she's talking about?

1679
01:59:10,852 --> 01:59:14,605
I was trying to accurately convey
the sentiments of everyone here.

1680
01:59:14,773 --> 01:59:16,607
That's what I intended to do.

1681
01:59:21,196 --> 01:59:24,156
Meredith, could you step outside for a moment?

1682
01:59:26,576 --> 01:59:27,618
Bye-bye.

1683
01:59:35,794 --> 01:59:38,128
Can you build the darn thing or not?

1684
01:59:39,047 --> 01:59:41,048
Yes, sir, we can.

1685
01:59:42,467 --> 01:59:47,263
Tom, they're replacing Meredith.
Garvin's announcing it in 10 minutes.

1686
01:59:50,141 --> 01:59:51,851
Ten minutes?

1687
02:00:15,417 --> 02:00:17,585
I'm surprised you didn't come to gloat.

1688
02:00:17,794 --> 02:00:22,590
Gloating is underrated. I actually
came here to pick up the Arcamax files.

1689
02:00:22,757 --> 02:00:26,510
- Very smart people underrated you.
- Thank you, Meredith.

1690
02:00:27,095 --> 02:00:28,762
Not including myself.

1691
02:00:28,930 --> 02:00:31,849
I beat you. I beat you fair and square.

1692
02:00:32,350 --> 02:00:34,268
Garvin lost his nerve.

1693
02:00:34,436 --> 02:00:37,813
It was his brilliant idea
to fire you for incompetence.

1694
02:00:37,981 --> 02:00:39,356
Him and Phil.

1695
02:00:39,524 --> 02:00:41,108
And I'm the one getting fired.

1696
02:00:42,110 --> 02:00:46,697
I've never seen you play the victim.
It's the only good quality you had.

1697
02:00:46,865 --> 02:00:51,493
I'm playing the game the way you guys
set it up, and I'm being punished for it.

1698
02:00:51,661 --> 02:00:53,329
It's fine.

1699
02:00:53,496 --> 02:00:57,374
I've had calls from 10 head-hunters
with job offers in the last hour.

1700
02:00:58,710 --> 02:01:02,338
Don't be surprised if I'm back
in 10 years to buy this place.

1701
02:01:04,382 --> 02:01:09,261
Did it ever occur to you, Meredith,
that maybe I set you up?

1702
02:01:24,527 --> 02:01:26,904
- Tom, this is my son, Spencer.
- How you doing?

1703
02:01:27,072 --> 02:01:29,031
- Good.
- You're at the University of Washington?

1704
02:01:29,199 --> 02:01:30,908
- Yeah.
- That's great. Very good.

1705
02:01:41,378 --> 02:01:44,797
Wow. Wow.

1706
02:01:48,927 --> 02:01:50,427
What a week!

1707
02:01:50,595 --> 02:01:57,017
The Chinese say:
"May you live in interesting times."

1708
02:01:57,936 --> 02:02:02,272
This merger is the most
interesting merger I've had...

1709
02:02:02,440 --> 02:02:04,233
...since my second marriage.

1710
02:02:05,777 --> 02:02:07,778
The merger is complete.

1711
02:02:08,405 --> 02:02:10,406
The question now is...

1712
02:02:11,032 --> 02:02:15,202
...who do we find to run things
up here in Seattle?

1713
02:02:15,412 --> 02:02:17,871
And what I realized during this...

1714
02:02:18,039 --> 02:02:20,332
...very interesting week...

1715
02:02:20,792 --> 02:02:24,128
...is that I have probably focused too much on...

1716
02:02:24,295 --> 02:02:28,340
...breaking the glass ceiling,
on finding a woman to run things here...

1717
02:02:28,508 --> 02:02:32,428
...when what I should have been
looking for is the best person...

1718
02:02:32,637 --> 02:02:34,388
...to run things up here.

1719
02:02:35,056 --> 02:02:36,390
Someone whose...

1720
02:02:36,558 --> 02:02:41,145
...long service with this company
has established a record...

1721
02:02:41,479 --> 02:02:42,980
...of creativity...

1722
02:02:43,148 --> 02:02:44,815
...sound judgment...

1723
02:02:45,066 --> 02:02:47,484
...and hands-on expertise.

1724
02:02:48,486 --> 02:02:50,154
And that person...

1725
02:02:51,072 --> 02:02:52,906
...is Stephanie Kaplan.

1726
02:02:59,330 --> 02:03:01,582
Congratulations, Stephanie.

1727
02:03:12,969 --> 02:03:16,013
I tell you something, she's the greatest!

1728
02:03:17,348 --> 02:03:19,016
Thank you.

1729
02:03:19,684 --> 02:03:23,729
First, I'd like to take the opportunity
to thank the department heads:

1730
02:03:24,064 --> 02:03:27,107
Mary Anne Hunter and Mark Lewyn here...

1731
02:03:27,275 --> 02:03:30,402
...and, um, Don Cherry, where are you?

1732
02:03:30,570 --> 02:03:32,279
There's Don Cherry.

1733
02:03:32,447 --> 02:03:35,074
And particularly, Tom Sanders...

1734
02:03:35,241 --> 02:03:38,744
...who epitomizes the inventiveness
of this division...

1735
02:03:38,995 --> 02:03:40,704
...its past and its future.

1736
02:03:41,372 --> 02:03:44,625
I'm counting on you to be my right hand.

1737
02:03:45,376 --> 02:03:47,086
Thank you.

1738
02:03:52,884 --> 02:03:56,762
We are heading into a new millennium...

1739
02:03:57,013 --> 02:03:58,305
...a new time.

1740
02:03:58,473 --> 02:04:01,350
You a chemistry major, Spencer?

1741
02:04:01,893 --> 02:04:04,478
Yeah, I am.

1742
02:04:05,939 --> 02:04:10,692
I know a chemistry professor there,
Dr. Arthur Friend. A. Friend.

1743
02:04:10,860 --> 02:04:13,112
I don't know if he teaches freshmen or not.

1744
02:04:13,279 --> 02:04:15,280
I'm his research assistant.

1745
02:04:16,116 --> 02:04:19,118
So if Dr. Arthur Friend was in Nepal,
for example...

1746
02:04:19,285 --> 02:04:23,497
...you'd have the keys to his office
and password to his computer?

1747
02:04:26,543 --> 02:04:27,918
Yeah.

1748
02:04:28,503 --> 02:04:31,755
We all work so well together and it's exciting...

1749
02:04:31,923 --> 02:04:33,882
...and it's wonderful to see. Um--

1750
02:04:35,260 --> 02:04:37,094
Ah, thank you.

1751
02:04:38,263 --> 02:04:40,430
Your mother's an extraordinary woman.

1752
02:04:40,682 --> 02:04:41,974
You just figured that out?
