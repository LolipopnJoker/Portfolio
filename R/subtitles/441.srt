1
00:01:04,779 --> 00:01:07,714
All of life is a coming home.

2
00:01:07,782 --> 00:01:12,048
Salesmen, secretaries, coal miners,
beekeepers, sword swallowers,

3
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,053
all of us.

4
00:01:14,121 --> 00:01:17,386
All the restless hearts
of the world...

5
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:20,393
all trying
to find a way home.

6
00:01:22,597 --> 00:01:25,998
It's hard to describe
what I felt like then.

7
00:01:26,067 --> 00:01:29,503
Picture yourself walking
for days in a driving snow.

8
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:32,505
You don't even know
you're walking in circles,

9
00:01:32,573 --> 00:01:35,508
the heaviness of your legs
in the drifts;

10
00:01:35,576 --> 00:01:37,942
your shouts
disappearing into the wind.

11
00:01:38,012 --> 00:01:40,242
How small you can feel.

12
00:01:40,314 --> 00:01:43,112
How far away home can be.

13
00:02:00,268 --> 00:02:02,293
Home.

14
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,806
The dictionary defines it
as both a place of origin...

15
00:02:05,873 --> 00:02:07,932
and a goal or destination.

16
00:02:09,377 --> 00:02:11,311
And the storm?

17
00:02:11,379 --> 00:02:14,143
The storm was all in my mind.

18
00:02:14,215 --> 00:02:16,479
Or, as the poet Dante put it...

19
00:02:16,551 --> 00:02:20,248
"In the middle of the journey of my life
I found myself in a dark wood...

20
00:02:20,321 --> 00:02:22,755
for I had lost
the right path. "

21
00:02:23,891 --> 00:02:26,689
Eventually I would find
the right path...

22
00:02:26,761 --> 00:02:29,594
but in the most unlikely place.

23
00:03:01,429 --> 00:03:03,363
How many fingers
do you see?

24
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:05,865
You crazy-
Stop sneakin' up on me like that.

25
00:03:05,933 --> 00:03:07,662
How many?

26
00:03:07,735 --> 00:03:10,363
-Four.
-Four?

27
00:03:10,438 --> 00:03:12,872
Four?

28
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,874
Another idiot.

29
00:03:16,043 --> 00:03:18,102
You gon' love it here.

30
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,614
Got a new one, Jane.
Hunter Adams.

31
00:03:21,682 --> 00:03:24,617
Self-committed. Suicidal.
Slate him with Dr. Prack.

32
00:03:24,685 --> 00:03:26,619
All right.

33
00:03:34,061 --> 00:03:37,189
Hey, Rudy!
What's the word, my man?

34
00:03:37,264 --> 00:03:40,825
He ain't left that bed in three weeks.
He won't give you any trouble.

35
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:44,132
He needs another bedpan. They're in
the closet. Wake-up is 7:00 a. m.

36
00:03:44,205 --> 00:03:46,139
Excuse me.

37
00:03:46,207 --> 00:03:49,199
Is there any way
I could have my own room?

38
00:03:50,611 --> 00:03:52,738
Oh, absolutely.

39
00:03:52,813 --> 00:03:55,543
Just call the concierge and ask
for a suite overlooking the fountain.

40
00:03:55,616 --> 00:03:58,050
No, I-I prefer
the cabana room.

41
00:03:58,119 --> 00:04:00,178
Get some sleep.

42
00:04:11,232 --> 00:04:13,166
Hi.

43
00:04:15,036 --> 00:04:17,095
Hi.

44
00:04:20,808 --> 00:04:22,742
You're, um...

45
00:04:23,944 --> 00:04:27,607
you're a lot... fuzzier
than my last roommate.

46
00:04:27,682 --> 00:04:29,274
Oh. Yeah.

47
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,284
Keeps me warm.

48
00:04:32,353 --> 00:04:34,913
Aaaah!

49
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:39,719
-What's wrong?
-Get 'em away!

50
00:04:39,794 --> 00:04:42,627
-Get what away?
-Get 'em-Get 'em away!

51
00:04:42,697 --> 00:04:45,188
-Okay, I'm gonna have to-
-You traitor!

52
00:04:45,266 --> 00:04:49,396
You brought 'em with you
when you opened the door!

53
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,268
Who?

54
00:04:54,275 --> 00:04:57,210
We need help in here!

55
00:04:57,278 --> 00:04:59,212
Somebody!

56
00:05:01,782 --> 00:05:03,716
-All right.
-No! No! No!

57
00:05:03,784 --> 00:05:07,811
They'll get me! Don't take me down!
They'll get me! No!

58
00:05:07,888 --> 00:05:10,823
Don't let the squirrels get me!
Please!

59
00:05:10,891 --> 00:05:12,620
Don't let the squirrels get me!

60
00:05:15,696 --> 00:05:18,631
That was a squirrel bite!

61
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:20,792
Squirrels.

62
00:05:23,137 --> 00:05:26,072
My father died when I was nine.

63
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:30,236
He was in the army.
He wasn't home very much.

64
00:05:31,378 --> 00:05:34,313
Two weeks before he died...

65
00:05:34,381 --> 00:05:37,316
he told me that
in the Korean War...

66
00:05:37,384 --> 00:05:39,818
it felt like
he'd lost his soul.

67
00:05:39,887 --> 00:05:43,482
All this time
I thought it was me.

68
00:05:43,557 --> 00:05:47,493
I moved seven times
in the last year.

69
00:05:47,561 --> 00:05:50,155
I've, uh, had several jobs.

70
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:54,000
Nothing seemed to fit.

71
00:05:54,068 --> 00:05:56,002
I don't seem to fit.

72
00:05:58,572 --> 00:06:01,939
And when your father died,
how did that make you feel?

73
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:04,773
I don't know.
I was nine.

74
00:06:06,347 --> 00:06:09,680
It was like there was
this distinction, suddenly...

75
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,685
between you
and the rest of the world.

76
00:06:12,753 --> 00:06:14,687
I looked around me.

77
00:06:14,755 --> 00:06:18,316
Life went on
just like it did before.

78
00:06:18,392 --> 00:06:21,657
But it wasn't
like it was before.

79
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:24,664
My uncle helped.
He would visit.

80
00:06:24,732 --> 00:06:26,666
He at least listened.

81
00:06:28,369 --> 00:06:30,360
And I thought...

82
00:06:30,437 --> 00:06:35,397
if I could light my own farts I could
fly to the moon, or at least Uranus.

83
00:06:35,476 --> 00:06:39,003
But if I couldn't do that at least
I could use my penis as a pogo stick...

84
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:42,014
and that might be a way
of getting around.

85
00:06:42,082 --> 00:06:44,380
I'm sorry?

86
00:06:44,451 --> 00:06:46,385
-Yes, that's good.
-Mm-hmm.

87
00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:51,681
Well, I think you're making fine progress,
Hunter. We'll talk later in group.

88
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,694
Thank you.

89
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:07,907
Four. Four? Four!

90
00:07:07,975 --> 00:07:11,274
Ohh! Four! Ohh!

91
00:07:11,345 --> 00:07:15,406
You are all insane!
Insane! Four!

92
00:07:15,482 --> 00:07:17,575
Arthur Mendelson.

93
00:07:18,986 --> 00:07:20,920
The Arthur Mendelson?

94
00:07:20,988 --> 00:07:23,115
Brand Beaton Industries.

95
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:26,125
Guy was one of the most
innovative minds of our time.

96
00:07:26,193 --> 00:07:29,128
Look at him now.
He can't even count the windows.

97
00:07:31,265 --> 00:07:34,200
God. What happened to him?
Why is he here?

98
00:07:34,268 --> 00:07:37,965
Self-committed. Genius syndrome.
Howard Hughes-type shit.

99
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:41,565
Constantly digging into the
creative potential of the human mind.

100
00:07:44,144 --> 00:07:46,408
I guess he dug too deep.

101
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,448
This is real wood.

102
00:07:48,515 --> 00:07:51,075
Rowff!

103
00:07:54,321 --> 00:07:57,916
W-Why are we meeting in here?
It's cramped.

104
00:07:57,992 --> 00:08:01,428
Well, Everton, we're meeting in here
so that Rudy can participate.

105
00:08:01,495 --> 00:08:04,464
-It's cramped.
-Does anyone else have a thought on that?

106
00:08:04,531 --> 00:08:07,898
-Cramped!
-I think he has a question.

107
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:13,406
Do you find that funny, Hunter,
making fun of a man's infirmity?

108
00:08:13,474 --> 00:08:16,068
Maybe he does have a question.
He's alive.

109
00:08:16,143 --> 00:08:19,078
-He's catatonic.
-Well, he still has a brain.

110
00:08:19,146 --> 00:08:21,910
-Maybe he wants to participate too.
-Yeah.

111
00:08:21,982 --> 00:08:23,916
Maybe he has a question.

112
00:08:23,984 --> 00:08:25,918
Yeah, maybe.

113
00:08:25,986 --> 00:08:28,181
Maybe he knows why we're cramped!

114
00:08:31,258 --> 00:08:34,853
Maybe Beany knows a lot more
than we give him credit for.

115
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:37,830
Excuse me. Beany?
Which way is heaven?

116
00:08:37,898 --> 00:08:39,832
That's correct!

117
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,367
That'll be enough, Hunter.

118
00:08:41,435 --> 00:08:44,495
Beany, how much taller
is Wilt Chamberlain than you?

119
00:08:44,571 --> 00:08:46,698
Right.

120
00:08:46,774 --> 00:08:49,937
Hey, Beany! Beany!
Where's the ceiling?

121
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,308
That's enough. Stop it.

122
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:54,939
Where do the birds fly, Beany?

123
00:08:55,015 --> 00:08:56,949
How do you say hello to Hitler?

124
00:08:57,017 --> 00:09:00,817
Beany, how does Hitler say hello?

125
00:09:02,256 --> 00:09:06,625
How do you check
an elephant for a hernia?

126
00:09:06,694 --> 00:09:10,027
Who would win a staring contest?
Beany!

127
00:09:10,097 --> 00:09:12,065
Who-Who farted?

128
00:09:12,132 --> 00:09:14,225
Beany!

129
00:09:14,301 --> 00:09:17,168
-Who likes to masturbate?
-Yea!

130
00:09:17,237 --> 00:09:19,205
I do! I do!

131
00:09:19,273 --> 00:09:23,209
Hey, Beany, how does an
one-armed referee say "field goal"?

132
00:09:23,277 --> 00:09:24,904
Ha ha! Hey, Beany!

133
00:09:24,979 --> 00:09:28,346
Ciao, Beany!
Arigato, Beany!

134
00:09:28,415 --> 00:09:30,349
Bye, Beany.

135
00:09:32,886 --> 00:09:34,945
It was a really good session,
I thought.

136
00:09:51,026 --> 00:09:52,960
May I come in?

137
00:09:54,263 --> 00:09:56,697
If you bend your medial
collateral ligaments...

138
00:09:56,765 --> 00:09:59,199
and place one talus
in front of another...

139
00:09:59,268 --> 00:10:01,702
I don't see where
you'd have a problem.

140
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,705
Of course, if there were a news story
covering this event...

141
00:10:04,773 --> 00:10:07,799
the headline might read:
"Small Brain Enters Room. "

142
00:10:10,312 --> 00:10:13,145
The fingers.
What's the answer?

143
00:10:13,215 --> 00:10:16,150
Oh, you're another one of
those bright young fellows...

144
00:10:16,218 --> 00:10:19,153
who always know the right answer,
is that it?

145
00:10:19,221 --> 00:10:21,382
Welcome to real life.

146
00:10:56,892 --> 00:10:58,826
How many do you see?

147
00:11:01,363 --> 00:11:04,298
-There are four fingers, Arthur.
-No, no, no. Look at me.

148
00:11:04,366 --> 00:11:06,129
What?

149
00:11:06,201 --> 00:11:08,135
Y-You're focusing
on the problem.

150
00:11:08,203 --> 00:11:11,297
If you focus on the problem,
you can't see the solution.

151
00:11:11,373 --> 00:11:14,570
Never focus on the problem.
Look at me!

152
00:11:15,877 --> 00:11:18,471
How many do you see?

153
00:11:20,148 --> 00:11:23,743
No, look beyond the fingers.

154
00:11:23,819 --> 00:11:25,753
How many do you see?

155
00:11:31,326 --> 00:11:33,260
Eight.

156
00:11:33,328 --> 00:11:36,320
Eight. Eight.
Yes! Yes!

157
00:11:36,398 --> 00:11:39,367
Eight's a good answer.
Yes.

158
00:11:39,434 --> 00:11:41,834
See what no one else sees.

159
00:11:41,903 --> 00:11:44,633
See what everyone else
chooses not to see...

160
00:11:44,706 --> 00:11:47,766
out of fear
and conformity and laziness.

161
00:11:47,843 --> 00:11:51,142
See the whole world anew
each day.

162
00:11:52,647 --> 00:11:55,582
Ah, the truth is,
you're well on the way.

163
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:58,585
If you didn't
see something here...

164
00:11:58,653 --> 00:12:01,918
besides a crazy,
bitter old man...

165
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,925
you wouldn't have come
in the first place.

166
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:11,365
What do you see
when you look at me, Arthur?

167
00:12:15,604 --> 00:12:17,538
You fixed my cup.

168
00:12:19,107 --> 00:12:21,041
I'll see you around...

169
00:12:22,344 --> 00:12:24,278
Patch.

170
00:12:32,053 --> 00:12:34,487
Rudy, stop.

171
00:12:34,556 --> 00:12:36,990
You're throwing off
my rhythm.

172
00:12:37,058 --> 00:12:38,992
You'll go blind.

173
00:12:40,162 --> 00:12:42,824
-Please.
-I have to go to the bathroom.

174
00:12:42,898 --> 00:12:46,834
Then go. It's right over there,
15 feet away.

175
00:12:46,902 --> 00:12:50,861
-I would, but-
-But what? The squirrels?

176
00:12:50,939 --> 00:12:53,373
-How many?
-There's only one just now.

177
00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:57,803
You can't go to the bathroom
because of one squirrel?

178
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:00,712
If I get off the bed,
he'll get the others.

179
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,884
That's not the point.

180
00:13:03,952 --> 00:13:05,886
They're squirrels.

181
00:13:05,954 --> 00:13:07,979
Squirrels, Rudy.

182
00:13:08,056 --> 00:13:10,692
They're one of the most
amiable creatures on the planet.

183
00:13:10,693 --> 00:13:11,993
Oh, no, they're not.

184
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,995
On the list of hostile predators,
they're right above the bottom...

185
00:13:15,063 --> 00:13:17,657
just above baby chicks
and slugs.

186
00:13:17,732 --> 00:13:20,223
What could they possibly want?
Your nuts?

187
00:13:21,303 --> 00:13:23,737
-Do you think?
-Oh, Rudy.

188
00:13:23,805 --> 00:13:26,899
-Come on, I'll take you.
-Don't move.

189
00:13:26,975 --> 00:13:30,240
-Don't move.
-Another one?

190
00:13:31,713 --> 00:13:35,046
It's on the end of your bed,
on the rail.

191
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,089
Be careful.
It's gonna jump.

192
00:13:54,135 --> 00:13:56,695
-There's one, at the end of the bed!
-Bang!

193
00:13:56,771 --> 00:13:59,706
There's one runnin'
across the sprinkler!

194
00:13:59,774 --> 00:14:02,106
-Boom!
-In back of the door! Back of the door!

195
00:14:02,177 --> 00:14:05,112
Coming out of the bathroom!

196
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,614
Bathroom! Bathroom!
Bathroom! Bathroom!

197
00:14:07,682 --> 00:14:10,082
Yea!

198
00:14:10,151 --> 00:14:13,882
Eat lead, fur bag!
Blam! Ha-ha!

199
00:14:13,955 --> 00:14:17,391
-You're cured-Aaah!
-You've got one on your shoulder!

200
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:20,087
Get it off me! Get it off me!

201
00:14:20,161 --> 00:14:23,494
Get it off me! Aaaah!

202
00:14:25,133 --> 00:14:28,068
We need more cover!
They're comin' in the back door!

203
00:14:28,136 --> 00:14:29,663
Get under cover, Rudy!

204
00:14:29,664 --> 00:14:31,664
Build a fort! Build a fort!
We can build a fort!

205
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:36,006
-We need a fort!
-Aaah! Down! Get down!

206
00:14:39,781 --> 00:14:41,715
They're gone.

207
00:14:41,783 --> 00:14:44,718
I think it's safe to go
to the bathroom, Rudy. Come on.

208
00:14:44,786 --> 00:14:47,380
-No, it's too risky.
-No.

209
00:14:47,455 --> 00:14:49,389
Not when you have...

210
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,392
this.

211
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,395
-A bazooka.
-Yeah.

212
00:14:55,463 --> 00:14:57,397
Load.

213
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:05,201
-Let's do it!
-Aaaah!

214
00:15:22,657 --> 00:15:24,591
Yes.

215
00:15:32,701 --> 00:15:34,635
I'd like to leave.

216
00:15:36,204 --> 00:15:39,367
Hunter, we'll have to discuss this
at your scheduled time.

217
00:15:39,441 --> 00:15:41,375
I'm leaving.

218
00:15:42,477 --> 00:15:44,411
Have you thought
about what you'll do?

219
00:15:44,479 --> 00:15:46,913
I want to help people.

220
00:15:46,982 --> 00:15:50,474
Last night with Rudy,
I connected to another human being.

221
00:15:50,552 --> 00:15:54,818
I want more of that. I want to learn about
people, help them with their troubles.

222
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:57,221
-That's what I do.
-But you suck at it.

223
00:15:57,292 --> 00:16:00,227
You don't even look at people
when they're talking.

224
00:16:00,295 --> 00:16:02,889
I want to listen,
really listen to people.

225
00:16:02,964 --> 00:16:07,492
I can't allow you to leave. I believe
you still have some issues to work out.

226
00:16:07,569 --> 00:16:11,005
Ah. Well, I don't need your permission
because I admitted myself.

227
00:16:11,072 --> 00:16:13,006
-Hunter.
-Mm-hmm?

228
00:16:13,074 --> 00:16:16,510
I must warn you
my report will read "A.M.A."-

229
00:16:16,578 --> 00:16:19,741
that you were signed out of this
hospital "against medical advice. "

230
00:16:19,814 --> 00:16:22,908
And my report will read
"I.D.G.A.R.A."

231
00:16:22,984 --> 00:16:25,418
"I don't give a rat's ass. "

232
00:16:26,821 --> 00:16:28,755
And my name is Patch.

233
00:17:04,205 --> 00:17:06,639
Hello.
How you doin'?

234
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,642
How do you do?

235
00:17:10,945 --> 00:17:13,379
Hey, this is a nice room.

236
00:17:13,448 --> 00:17:14,643
May I help you?

237
00:17:14,644 --> 00:17:17,744
Yeah, I could really use a
foot massage right now.

238
00:17:18,453 --> 00:17:20,387
Rephrasing:
What are you doing here?

239
00:17:20,455 --> 00:17:22,889
I'm your new roommate.
I-I'm moving in.

240
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,529
I don't mean to be rude, but aren't you
a little old to be starting medical school?

241
00:17:29,597 --> 00:17:32,623
You know, Babe Ruth was 39
when he joined the Yankees.

242
00:17:32,701 --> 00:17:34,635
-No, he wasn't.
-You're right.

243
00:17:34,703 --> 00:17:38,799
But I could really use an example like that,
and if you ever find one, let me know.

244
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,940
Hi. Patch Adams.

245
00:17:43,011 --> 00:17:45,445
Mitch Vroman.
Georgetown University.

246
00:17:45,513 --> 00:17:48,539
I was awarded the William F. Thompson
Scientific Achievement Award.

247
00:17:48,616 --> 00:17:50,550
Mmm. Emerson Elementary.

248
00:17:50,618 --> 00:17:54,452
I once drew a picture of a rabbit
that got me two gold stars.

249
00:17:56,624 --> 00:17:59,957
I'm gonna go
back over there now.

250
00:18:04,032 --> 00:18:07,297
First do no harm.

251
00:18:07,368 --> 00:18:11,702
What is implicit in this
simple precept of medicine?

252
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,968
An awesome power.

253
00:18:15,043 --> 00:18:17,477
The power to do harm.

254
00:18:18,947 --> 00:18:21,279
Who gives you this power?

255
00:18:21,349 --> 00:18:23,442
The patient.

256
00:18:23,518 --> 00:18:26,817
A patient will come to you
at his moment of greatest dread..

257
00:18:26,888 --> 00:18:30,722
hand you a knife and say,
"Doctor, cut me open. "

258
00:18:30,792 --> 00:18:32,760
Why?

259
00:18:32,827 --> 00:18:34,988
Because he trusts you.

260
00:18:35,063 --> 00:18:38,430
He trusts you
the way a child trusts.

261
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:43,460
He trusts you
to do no harm.

262
00:18:43,538 --> 00:18:46,166
The sad fact is...

263
00:18:46,241 --> 00:18:48,709
human beings
are not worthy of trust.

264
00:18:49,811 --> 00:18:51,745
It is human nature to lie...

265
00:18:51,813 --> 00:18:55,078
take shortcuts,
to lose your nerve, get tired...

266
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,550
make mistakes.

267
00:18:57,619 --> 00:19:01,214
No rational patient would
put his trust in a human being...

268
00:19:01,289 --> 00:19:03,723
and were not gonna let him!

269
00:19:03,792 --> 00:19:05,919
It is our mission here...

270
00:19:05,994 --> 00:19:10,021
to rigorously and ruthlessly
train the humanity out of you...

271
00:19:10,098 --> 00:19:12,430
and make you
into something better.

272
00:19:13,802 --> 00:19:16,737
We're gonna make doctors
out of you.

273
00:19:33,421 --> 00:19:35,355
Two years of studying.

274
00:19:35,423 --> 00:19:38,358
I thought we'd have more contact
with patients. Didn't you?

275
00:19:38,426 --> 00:19:40,360
Hi. I'm Patch.

276
00:19:40,428 --> 00:19:42,862
You've just experienced
a North American greeting...

277
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:45,365
whereby one person offers
a verbal label to another...

278
00:19:45,433 --> 00:19:47,867
as an expression
of welcome and friendship.

279
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:50,063
Lesbian. Ball-buster.
Airhead. Leech.

280
00:19:50,138 --> 00:19:53,073
Whichever one of these disgusts
you the most, take your pick.

281
00:19:53,141 --> 00:19:55,075
-Well-
-Please pass the word.

282
00:19:55,143 --> 00:19:58,579
I am not here to date. I am not
here to flirt. I'm here to study.

283
00:20:00,648 --> 00:20:02,582
Thank you.

284
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:06,086
I thought only I could repel women
with that kind of raw efficiency.

285
00:20:06,154 --> 00:20:08,918
Well, you just met your match.

286
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,254
-Patch Adams.
-Truman Schiff.

287
00:20:11,326 --> 00:20:13,760
Nice to meet you, Truman.

288
00:20:13,828 --> 00:20:15,921
Will you go out with me?

289
00:20:19,767 --> 00:20:22,395
May I ask you one question?

290
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:24,762
Do you buy everything
the dean was saying today?

291
00:20:24,763 --> 00:20:25,963
What do you mean?

292
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,474
I mean, that whole
drill sergeant thing.

293
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:31,774
"We're gon' make doctors
out of you medical scum.

294
00:20:31,846 --> 00:20:34,280
-Now drop down and give me 20."
-Mm-hmm.

295
00:20:34,349 --> 00:20:35,907
That whole marine thing.

296
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:38,919
We're not even gonna see
a patient until the third year.

297
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,921
Up until then,
it's just memorizing facts.

298
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,923
-Why don't they just shove the book up-
-Hamburger?

299
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:47,018
Right here on the colon. That's where
it's going anyway. Thanks very much.

300
00:20:47,095 --> 00:20:49,791
-So, why do you wanna be a doctor?
-I want to help.

301
00:20:49,864 --> 00:20:51,325
I want to connect with people.

302
00:20:51,326 --> 00:20:53,926
A doctor interacts with
people at their most vulnerable.

303
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:57,267
He offers treatment,
but he also offers counsel and hope.

304
00:20:57,338 --> 00:21:00,273
That's why I love the idea
of being a doctor.

305
00:21:00,341 --> 00:21:03,606
I've always been fascinated by
the development of the human mind.

306
00:21:03,678 --> 00:21:05,839
Ah. Pumping neurons.

307
00:21:05,914 --> 00:21:08,348
We start out so open
and spontaneous.

308
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:11,852
We're real individuals. Then somewhere
along the way we're drawn to conform.

309
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,315
It's as if we're conditioned
by programmed responses.

310
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:15,516
Well, that's true.

311
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:18,525
But sometimes you can alter
the programmed response...

312
00:21:18,593 --> 00:21:22,723
just by changing some of the conditions,
altering the parameters.

313
00:21:22,797 --> 00:21:24,697
Let me show you.

314
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,801
We'll call it
the "hello" experiment.

315
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:30,303
The goal will be to break through
programmed response...

316
00:21:30,371 --> 00:21:32,305
by changing normal parameters...

317
00:21:32,373 --> 00:21:34,170
and getting a new emotional response
from the person.

318
00:21:34,242 --> 00:21:36,176
Ready to enter data.

319
00:21:37,979 --> 00:21:39,913
Hello.

320
00:21:39,981 --> 00:21:42,245
Hi.

321
00:21:46,187 --> 00:21:48,121
Wait.
I don't get it.

322
00:21:48,189 --> 00:21:50,316
"Hi" is a programmed response.

323
00:21:50,391 --> 00:21:52,951
-I reached her.
-You scared her.

324
00:21:53,027 --> 00:21:56,190
No. Wait.
Wait for it.

325
00:21:57,398 --> 00:21:59,832
Oh, you're nuts.

326
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:02,426
A smile.

327
00:22:02,503 --> 00:22:05,097
Ten seconds.
Victory.

328
00:22:05,173 --> 00:22:07,437
There's more.
Come, my friend.

329
00:22:09,043 --> 00:22:10,977
-Howdy!
-Hi.

330
00:22:11,045 --> 00:22:12,979
See?
Response time is diminishing.

331
00:22:13,047 --> 00:22:15,481
Yesterday I made
12 random phone calls.

332
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:18,986
I talked to one man named Dale for
three hours. He told me amazing things.

333
00:22:19,053 --> 00:22:21,988
But what does this all prove,
other than you're out of your mind?

334
00:22:22,056 --> 00:22:24,991
What's the difference between
a doctor and a scientist?

335
00:22:25,059 --> 00:22:26,993
And don't say salary.

336
00:22:27,061 --> 00:22:30,497
People. Hmm? We want to become doctors
because we want to help people.

337
00:22:30,565 --> 00:22:32,499
I want to be
a pediatrician.

338
00:22:32,567 --> 00:22:34,501
Okay, little people.

339
00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:38,005
The point is, we have to treat
the patient as well as the disease.

340
00:22:38,072 --> 00:22:43,169
That's why we have to dive into people,
wade into the sea of humanity, Truman.

341
00:22:43,244 --> 00:22:45,804
Ballroom seven,
right upstairs on your left.

342
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,816
-You guys with the meat packers convention?
-Yes, sir!

343
00:22:49,884 --> 00:22:51,818
Right up the stairs.
Ballroom seven.

344
00:22:51,886 --> 00:22:54,821
-Hey! Does a chicken have lips?
-You'll find out upstairs!

345
00:22:54,889 --> 00:22:57,414
Like a bulldog
on a pork chop!

346
00:23:09,003 --> 00:23:11,938
You know, in New Zealand
they found a whole new use for sheep.

347
00:23:12,006 --> 00:23:13,940
-What's that?
-Wool!

348
00:23:15,209 --> 00:23:18,144
You're funny!
You kill me! You kill me!

349
00:23:18,212 --> 00:23:20,146
-I love you!
-Oh, daddy!

350
00:23:20,214 --> 00:23:23,149
And you-I bet you've heard that too!
Come here! Ha ha!

351
00:23:23,217 --> 00:23:25,879
-"Herd" it? That's a goat joke!
-Ohh!

352
00:23:35,396 --> 00:23:37,330
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

353
00:23:40,101 --> 00:23:42,296
On your meat!

354
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:44,804
Get set! Go!

355
00:23:46,774 --> 00:23:49,971
Ohh! Yeah!

356
00:23:51,045 --> 00:23:53,343
I won!

357
00:23:56,350 --> 00:24:00,013
Pork packers,
rump wrappers, bull shippers,

358
00:24:00,088 --> 00:24:02,955
lend me your steers!

359
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:11,357
You know, we packers have been
taking a bad rap for years.

360
00:24:11,432 --> 00:24:13,866
Yeah!

361
00:24:13,935 --> 00:24:18,065
Because we all want to be
the best damn packers there are!

362
00:24:18,139 --> 00:24:21,165
-Yeah! Yeah!
-I'm proud of my meat!

363
00:24:21,242 --> 00:24:23,733
-And I know you're proud of your meat!
-Yeah!

364
00:24:23,811 --> 00:24:26,712
-Whip it, zip it and send it out!
-Yeah!

365
00:24:28,783 --> 00:24:30,876
You know,
some people say chicken.

366
00:24:30,952 --> 00:24:32,146
-No!
-No!

367
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,518
-Some people say fish.
-No!

368
00:24:34,589 --> 00:24:39,185
I say,
now is the time for cow!

369
00:24:41,262 --> 00:24:44,095
Eat cow! Eat cow! Eat cow! Eat cow!

370
00:24:44,165 --> 00:24:48,297
Eat cow! Eat cow!
Eat cow! Eat cow! Eat cow!

371
00:24:48,569 --> 00:24:52,200
Eat cow! Eat cow!
Eat cow! Eat cow! Eat cow!

372
00:24:52,273 --> 00:24:54,241
Hey, bud.

373
00:24:54,308 --> 00:24:56,503
-Hey!
-Oh!

374
00:24:56,577 --> 00:24:59,671
Yes, thanks.
Oh, yeah.

375
00:24:59,747 --> 00:25:03,183
Hey-Whoa!

376
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:05,185
What is it?

377
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:09,441
What's the difference between a first-year
and a third-year medical student?

378
00:25:14,413 --> 00:25:18,850
Doctor Vukov, please dial line 1242.

379
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:22,683
Dr. Vukov,
please dial line 1242.

380
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:27,357
Here we have
a juvenile onset diabetic...

381
00:25:27,426 --> 00:25:30,589
with poor circulation
and diabetic neuropathy.

382
00:25:30,663 --> 00:25:33,598
As you can see,
these are diabetic ulcers...

383
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:35,861
with lymphedema
and evidence of gangrene.

384
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,868
Questions?

385
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:40,564
-Any osteomyelitis?
-None apparent.

386
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:42,197
Although not definitive.

387
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:44,401
-Treatment?
-To stabilize the blood sugar.

388
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:47,206
Consider antibiotics,
possibly amputation.

389
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,372
What's her name?

390
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:56,588
I was just wondering
the patient's name.

391
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,524
Marjorie.

392
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,521
Hi, Marjorie.

393
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,222
Hi.

394
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:08,857
Yes, um, thank you.

395
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:10,868
Let's move on.

396
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:16,207
-What are you doing?
-Continuing the experiment. Come on.

397
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:19,210
We can start a lemonade stand together
after we get kicked out of medical school.

398
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:20,973
Bye, Marjorie.

399
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:23,981
I cannot stand it in there, Joletta.

400
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:26,984
He doesn't have
to talk to me like that.

401
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:30,488
I know, hon, but really,
how good a mood would you be in?

402
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:34,922
-May I help you?
-Oh, um-

403
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:37,928
So I'll meet you
at the club.

404
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:41,591
Oh, great.
Maybe we'll play the back nine, hmm?

405
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:46,003
Hello. I'm Patch.

406
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:48,005
I'm studying medicine here.

407
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:52,134
Well, not here, but-
Y-You know.

408
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:55,009
Lookit here, Judy.
Another future boss.

409
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,139
Oh, I wouldn't
look at it like that.

410
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:59,150
You may think
I'm exaggeratin'...

411
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:02,085
but in another five years
you'll be so full of yourself...

412
00:27:02,154 --> 00:27:05,749
you'll have to hang a cup out your ass
just to catch the excess.

413
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:06,692
-Joletta!
-Ouch.

414
00:27:06,693 --> 00:27:08,293
Well, hell, why not?

415
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,295
It's the only time in my life
I'm gonna outrank him.

416
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:13,831
Might as well enjoy it.

417
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:15,100
Who's in that room?

418
00:27:15,101 --> 00:27:17,901
Don't even think about it.
He'll bite your head off.

419
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,165
Mr. Davis.
Pancreatic cancer.

420
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,274
How long does he have?

421
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:26,277
Longer than you,
if you go in that room.

422
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:28,438
So be sure
you steer clear.

423
00:27:28,514 --> 00:27:31,108
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you.

424
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,285
Hey!
What year are you?

425
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:43,527
-Hi.
-Hey.

426
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:55,138
Dr. Landaker to Administration.

427
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:57,641
Dr. Landaker
to Administration, please.

428
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:29,006
Hi.

429
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:30,839
Hi.

430
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:33,605
-What's your name?
-Cameron.

431
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,944
Hi, Cameron.
I'm Patch.

432
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:01,436
I have a cold. Just a bit of a cold.

433
00:29:01,507 --> 00:29:05,273
Is my nose red?
Oh, it is. It's red.

434
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:09,971
Ohh! Oh.

435
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:12,278
What's that?
You don't know?

436
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:14,285
I don't either.
Let's find out.

437
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:17,788
Taxi!

438
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:20,791
Try on you.
Give it to me.

439
00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:26,564
It's working very well.

440
00:29:26,632 --> 00:29:28,759
Let's see what else we have.

441
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:31,064
Look at some of this stuff.

442
00:29:41,847 --> 00:29:44,509
Bee kisses.

443
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,594
Hi.

444
00:29:56,662 --> 00:29:58,596
-Hi.
-You mind if I sit down?

445
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:28,526
Hah? Well, then,
hello, hello.

446
00:30:28,594 --> 00:30:30,118
Oh, look at-

447
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:45,967
Yee-haah!
Yee-haah!

448
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:50,071
Whoa! Whoa!
Yee-haah!

449
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:52,742
Come on, buddy!
Whee-haah!

450
00:30:53,986 --> 00:30:56,580
What is going on here?

451
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:12,762
Sit down.

452
00:31:12,838 --> 00:31:16,365
Get in your beds right now.

453
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:18,409
Sit down! Sit down!

454
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:23,911
Lie down in your beds
right now!

455
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:27,247
-I've checked up on you, Hunter.
-Patch.

456
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:30,254
Hunter, Dr. Prack was
a colleague of mine at Bringham.

457
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:32,756
He tells me
you have a brilliant mind...

458
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:37,352
and, like many brilliant people, you don't
necessarily think the rules apply to you.

459
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:40,865
Not all the rules, sir, but the Golden
Rule, I think that applies to everyone.

460
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:42,866
Don't you, sir?

461
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:47,098
I've also heard you have
a real passion to be a doctor, Hunter.

462
00:31:47,172 --> 00:31:49,106
Patch.

463
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:53,076
Truth of it is, Hunter,
passion doesn't make doctors.

464
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:55,545
I make doctors.

465
00:31:55,614 --> 00:31:57,548
Understood?

466
00:31:57,616 --> 00:32:00,107
-Understood.
-Good.

467
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:04,977
Medical students, as a rule, have no
contact with patients until the third year.

468
00:32:05,378 --> 00:32:06,902
-Is that clear?
-It is, sir, but don't you think-

469
00:32:06,979 --> 00:32:11,416
Our way of doing things
is a product of centuries of experience.

470
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:14,853
It's all there for a reason.

471
00:32:18,424 --> 00:32:20,858
It's my hospital.

472
00:32:20,927 --> 00:32:23,862
I know everything
that goes on inside of it.

473
00:32:25,598 --> 00:32:27,532
Everything.

474
00:32:29,468 --> 00:32:31,402
Deviation of the tongue.

475
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:33,438
-A problem with the cranial nerve.
-Which side?

476
00:32:33,506 --> 00:32:35,940
-Right side, tenth nerve.
-Twelfth nerve.

477
00:32:36,008 --> 00:32:38,943
Do you know how many billions of dollars
are wasted on malpractice insurance?

478
00:32:39,011 --> 00:32:41,946
That's money that goes to lawyers
that could go to patients.

479
00:32:42,014 --> 00:32:43,110
Hi, guys. Sorry I'm late.

480
00:32:43,111 --> 00:32:46,111
Does everybody know Carin Fisher,
Adelane's roommate?

481
00:32:46,185 --> 00:32:49,120
I invited her to join
our study group.

482
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:54,225
So, Carin, why do you
want to be a doctor?

483
00:32:54,293 --> 00:32:57,228
Is it just me, or do we
have a lot of work to do?

484
00:32:57,296 --> 00:32:59,821
It's just a question.
I think it's the question.

485
00:32:59,899 --> 00:33:02,561
Actually, I don't find the question
here in the outline.

486
00:33:02,635 --> 00:33:04,967
-What page are you on?
-Uh, 1432.

487
00:33:05,037 --> 00:33:06,800
Deviation of a tongue.

488
00:33:06,873 --> 00:33:09,433
We'd learn more if we were
working closely with patients.

489
00:33:09,508 --> 00:33:12,602
That's why we're studying-
to learn enough to help the patients.

490
00:33:12,678 --> 00:33:15,112
Adelane, don't waste your breath.

491
00:33:15,181 --> 00:33:17,115
Don't you th-

492
00:33:17,183 --> 00:33:19,515
Don't you think
I see through you?

493
00:33:19,585 --> 00:33:22,520
You act like you're above the system
when you're really just a nonconformist.

494
00:33:22,588 --> 00:33:24,522
You have to get
under the fingernails...

495
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:27,024
of any authority figure
that crosses your path...

496
00:33:27,093 --> 00:33:29,323
as a way of dealing
with some insecurity.

497
00:33:29,395 --> 00:33:31,329
Antisocial personality, I believe.
Intriguing diagnosis.

498
00:33:31,397 --> 00:33:35,026
Truman, this isn't funny. Smart people
flunk out of here all the time.

499
00:33:35,101 --> 00:33:39,504
Yeah, uh, odds are one of
the five of us sitting here, actually.

500
00:33:39,572 --> 00:33:41,506
I have another question.

501
00:33:41,574 --> 00:33:43,508
In a perfect system...

502
00:33:43,576 --> 00:33:46,010
why are patients referred to
by their disease...

503
00:33:46,078 --> 00:33:48,713
as in "that interesting cancer
patient," and not by their name?

504
00:33:48,781 --> 00:33:51,375
It certainly isn't to be mean.
It's to prevent transference.

505
00:33:51,376 --> 00:33:52,176
And why is that bad?

506
00:33:52,251 --> 00:33:55,652
-And the one flunking out is?
-Can we get back to the tongue?

507
00:33:55,721 --> 00:33:58,656
What if a doctor becomes
emotionally involved with a patient?

508
00:33:58,724 --> 00:34:00,658
Does a doctor explode?
No.

509
00:34:00,726 --> 00:34:02,591
Who came up
with these rules?

510
00:34:02,662 --> 00:34:04,596
It's against the Hippocratic oath,
I think.

511
00:34:04,664 --> 00:34:07,599
I don't really have time for this.
Sorry.

512
00:34:09,201 --> 00:34:10,964
Bye.

513
00:34:11,037 --> 00:34:12,971
-Bye.
-Sorry.

514
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:15,200
-Charming.
-Bye.

515
00:34:15,274 --> 00:34:17,208
-Truman?
-Yeah.

516
00:34:17,276 --> 00:34:20,512
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
stop you from studying.

517
00:34:20,513 --> 00:34:21,279
Go away!

518
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,816
I believe there's more
to being a doctor...

519
00:34:22,817 --> 00:34:24,783
than memorizing facts
about the ventricular artery.

520
00:34:24,784 --> 00:34:27,419
I don't care what you think.
I care about my biology test.

521
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,622
Maybe I could help you.
I read the bio book.

522
00:34:29,623 --> 00:34:30,723
The whole book?

523
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:32,724
Oh, yeah.
Now I'm on to Whitman.

524
00:34:32,792 --> 00:34:36,228
You can get Leaves of Grass at the bookstore
if you have a 20% student I.D. card.

525
00:34:36,295 --> 00:34:37,892
I don't want Walt Whitman.

526
00:34:37,893 --> 00:34:39,893
He wouldn't want you either.
He was a homosexual.

527
00:34:39,965 --> 00:34:42,563
But that's not relevant. What's relevant
is that he was a medical man.

528
00:34:42,635 --> 00:34:45,233
He was a nurse in the Civil War
and wrote great poetry.

529
00:34:45,304 --> 00:34:47,864
"Afoot and lighthearted,
I take to the open road-"

530
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,875
Look, I'm not sure
if you've noticed this...

531
00:34:50,943 --> 00:34:55,539
but in a class of 163 students
there are eight women-eight.

532
00:34:55,614 --> 00:34:57,810
I've had to work
really hard to get here,

533
00:34:57,811 --> 00:34:59,611
and I'm gonna have to
work even harder to stay...

534
00:34:59,618 --> 00:35:03,452
and I'm not about to blow it by wasting my
time on your flighty theories of goodness.

535
00:35:03,522 --> 00:35:06,753
I'm here to learn about medicine.
Period.

536
00:35:06,826 --> 00:35:08,760
Excuse me.

537
00:35:10,262 --> 00:35:13,197
I think somebody is
running away from something.

538
00:35:13,265 --> 00:35:16,723
Why can't it just be that
I'm running away from you?

539
00:35:36,622 --> 00:35:38,055
Hi.

540
00:35:42,294 --> 00:35:45,161
Very nice. Very nice.

541
00:35:49,769 --> 00:35:51,760
Do I look thin to you?

542
00:35:51,837 --> 00:35:54,772
'Cause I'm tryin' to lose
a little weight.

543
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,808
Is this too much?
Have I gone too far?

544
00:35:56,876 --> 00:35:59,208
I got a boner.

545
00:35:59,278 --> 00:36:01,007
I am a boner.

546
00:36:11,824 --> 00:36:14,258
Donner, party of 50!

547
00:36:14,326 --> 00:36:17,853
Donner! Donner party! Over here!

548
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:20,364
I don't know what's wrong here.

549
00:36:20,433 --> 00:36:24,267
I'm tryin' to light
the dials here, but, uh...

550
00:36:24,336 --> 00:36:27,328
bottom line is,
your TV's broken here.

551
00:36:29,542 --> 00:36:32,943
My name is
Officer Patty O'Furniture.

552
00:36:33,012 --> 00:36:35,947
I'm here today to talk to you
briefly about narcolepsy.

553
00:36:36,015 --> 00:36:38,483
Narcolepsy-

554
00:36:38,551 --> 00:36:39,882
Clown salute!

555
00:36:39,952 --> 00:36:43,046
Very good!

556
00:36:43,122 --> 00:36:44,714
Wide face!

557
00:36:46,058 --> 00:36:48,026
Fart face!

558
00:36:49,762 --> 00:36:53,198
The hospital will cover
all of your bills.

559
00:36:53,265 --> 00:36:55,199
Any other questions?

560
00:36:55,267 --> 00:36:58,668
My name is Doctor... Phil.

561
00:36:58,737 --> 00:37:01,729
I'll be your surgeon-
Oh, there you are.

562
00:37:01,807 --> 00:37:05,402
Ha ha ha! Hey!
Let's get ready to party!

563
00:37:09,048 --> 00:37:12,381
Grazie! Hey! Grazie!

564
00:37:12,451 --> 00:37:14,419
Grazie! Now take a bow!

565
00:37:37,576 --> 00:37:40,010
Don't believe
everything you read.

566
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:43,276
Looks like you didn't need
that study group after all.

567
00:37:43,349 --> 00:37:46,284
Well, it's no 98,
but I'm still here.

568
00:37:46,352 --> 00:37:48,286
Yeah.

569
00:37:48,354 --> 00:37:50,914
-Excuse me.
-Oh, excuse me. Excuse me.

570
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:52,719
Excuse me.

571
00:37:55,227 --> 00:37:58,363
You know, this completely
disrupts my point of view.

572
00:37:58,364 --> 00:37:59,064
Mm-hmm.

573
00:37:59,065 --> 00:38:01,598
It was so much more convenient
thinking of you as an idiot.

574
00:38:01,667 --> 00:38:04,101
-Don't count me out yet.
-It's frustrating.

575
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:07,537
I study all night, and I'm barely
hanging on by my fingernails.

576
00:38:07,606 --> 00:38:10,541
Oh, forget about that. I want to
show you something that's extraordinary.

577
00:38:12,611 --> 00:38:14,943
-An enema bulb?
-It used to be.

578
00:38:15,014 --> 00:38:17,448
This amazing piece of rubber...

579
00:38:17,516 --> 00:38:19,746
when applied to your face...

580
00:38:19,818 --> 00:38:21,911
can brighten
another person's day.

581
00:38:22,988 --> 00:38:25,422
Even a suffering patient.

582
00:38:25,491 --> 00:38:28,927
-I'm sure it's really great for kids, but-
-No, not just kids. Anybody.

583
00:38:28,994 --> 00:38:30,928
Patients are opening up
to me, Carin.

584
00:38:30,996 --> 00:38:32,930
They're sharing their dreams,
their fantasies...

585
00:38:32,998 --> 00:38:35,432
and if you hit on
the right topic...

586
00:38:35,501 --> 00:38:37,765
they brighten up
for one brief moment.

587
00:38:37,836 --> 00:38:39,770
They don't concentrate
on the pain.

588
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:42,966
They don't even feel the pain.

589
00:38:43,042 --> 00:38:44,976
-Try it on.
-No, thank you.

590
00:38:45,044 --> 00:38:48,309
I want you to try it on and help me.
Just try it on.

591
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:51,315
If you don't laugh,
you'll never see it again.

592
00:38:51,383 --> 00:38:54,352
But if you do,
you have to help me.

593
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,354
Just try it on.

594
00:39:00,226 --> 00:39:02,091
Hmm.

595
00:39:03,529 --> 00:39:06,362
You didn't say anything about a mirror.

596
00:39:08,067 --> 00:39:10,661
Who do you think
you look like?

597
00:39:11,904 --> 00:39:13,701
Karl Malden?

598
00:39:16,075 --> 00:39:18,600
You cheated.

599
00:39:19,845 --> 00:39:21,813
You can take the nose off now.

600
00:39:23,082 --> 00:39:25,016
So, what's the favor?

601
00:39:55,381 --> 00:39:57,315
Psst.

602
00:39:58,617 --> 00:40:00,084
Ready?

603
00:40:06,592 --> 00:40:08,719
Dumbo incoming!

604
00:40:12,498 --> 00:40:15,433
Bag 'im, Bwana!

605
00:40:17,836 --> 00:40:19,929
Killer poodle! You got lucky!

606
00:40:20,005 --> 00:40:22,940
Piranha fish!
Yea! Very good!

607
00:40:23,008 --> 00:40:25,875
Man down!

608
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,475
-What was that?
-It's nothing.

609
00:40:30,549 --> 00:40:32,483
Should I go check?

610
00:40:32,551 --> 00:40:34,485
I said, it's nothin'.

611
00:40:39,992 --> 00:40:41,960
One last one!

612
00:40:42,027 --> 00:40:44,257
Oww!

613
00:40:48,867 --> 00:40:52,303
Well, congratulations, Jackie.

614
00:40:52,371 --> 00:40:56,402
You've done it all. You've nailed
every balloon from here to Timbuktu.

615
00:40:57,676 --> 00:41:00,611
That was incredible, Patch.

616
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:02,647
Almost as good
as the real thing.

617
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:07,484
One last safari.

618
00:41:07,553 --> 00:41:09,487
That's all I wanted.

619
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:14,887
Thank you, Truman.
Both of you.

620
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,894
That was wonderful.

621
00:41:16,962 --> 00:41:20,398
Yes, it's been
a long time for me.

622
00:41:20,466 --> 00:41:23,629
What about you, dear?
What's your fantasy?

623
00:41:23,702 --> 00:41:25,795
Oh.

624
00:41:25,871 --> 00:41:27,805
When I was a little girl...

625
00:41:27,873 --> 00:41:32,173
whenever my mother
would cook spaghetti...

626
00:41:32,244 --> 00:41:37,614
she would let me reach into the pot
and squeeze the noodles.

627
00:41:37,683 --> 00:41:39,412
Oh!

628
00:41:40,552 --> 00:41:42,747
I've always wanted...

629
00:41:42,821 --> 00:41:46,484
to be in a swimming pool
full of noodles...

630
00:41:46,558 --> 00:41:49,994
wall-to-wall
and top-to-bottom.

631
00:41:50,062 --> 00:41:54,999
An entire pool
full of noodles.

632
00:41:56,368 --> 00:41:58,632
Oh.

633
00:41:58,704 --> 00:42:00,638
How about a poodle?

634
00:42:02,174 --> 00:42:05,610
And the award for valor goes to
Truman Schiff and his red welt.

635
00:42:05,677 --> 00:42:06,913
Thank you, Truman.

636
00:42:06,914 --> 00:42:09,581
Located just above my
nasal bone, adjacent to my-

637
00:42:09,681 --> 00:42:11,615
-Glabella!
-Glabella!

638
00:42:11,683 --> 00:42:13,674
Good night, Truman.

639
00:42:15,354 --> 00:42:17,288
Right.

640
00:42:17,356 --> 00:42:20,291
Fun's fun, kids, but my welt
and I have a study date...

641
00:42:20,359 --> 00:42:22,793
with the autonomic nerves
of the thorax.

642
00:42:22,861 --> 00:42:25,196
Good luck. Watch out
for the circle of Willis.

643
00:42:25,197 --> 00:42:26,163
Good luck to you.

644
00:42:26,164 --> 00:42:28,799
And our next award, in the tradition
of the great poodle handlers...

645
00:42:28,867 --> 00:42:30,801
where no actual transference
took place-

646
00:42:30,869 --> 00:42:35,033
All right. What you did in there,
it was very nice, I admit.

647
00:42:35,107 --> 00:42:38,042
Whoa. Is that a little ice
that just chipped off?

648
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:41,045
-You're never serious, are you?
-No. I tried that for years.

649
00:42:41,113 --> 00:42:43,547
Never really worked for me.

650
00:42:43,615 --> 00:42:45,549
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

651
00:42:45,617 --> 00:42:47,551
Oh.

652
00:42:47,619 --> 00:42:50,554
Well, I'd better go hit
the thorax as well, so-

653
00:42:50,622 --> 00:42:52,556
I have a crush on you.

654
00:42:52,624 --> 00:42:56,611
Ha! I can't believe I just
blurted that out.

655
00:42:56,745 --> 00:43:00,044
Look, thank you for
taking me along tonight.

656
00:43:00,115 --> 00:43:02,675
I actually had fun.

657
00:43:02,751 --> 00:43:04,378
Good night.

658
00:43:04,453 --> 00:43:06,114
Wait a minute.

659
00:43:06,188 --> 00:43:09,351
When I said I had a crush on you,
you didn't say...

660
00:43:09,424 --> 00:43:11,949
"No way, loser.
I'd rather have a lobotomy by a leper. "

661
00:43:12,027 --> 00:43:13,619
That means something.

662
00:43:13,695 --> 00:43:17,654
Maybe I was just being polite
and I didn't want to hurt your feelings.

663
00:43:17,732 --> 00:43:20,030
But you're not polite.
You're rude.

664
00:43:20,101 --> 00:43:22,035
Sometimes you're downright bitchy.

665
00:43:23,271 --> 00:43:25,205
-Good night.
-Good night.

666
00:43:40,455 --> 00:43:43,891
Dr. Hyer, please dial the pharmacy.

667
00:44:09,484 --> 00:44:11,748
Blue skies

668
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:14,084
Shining on me

669
00:44:14,155 --> 00:44:16,783
Nothin' but blue skies

670
00:44:16,858 --> 00:44:19,349
Do I see

671
00:44:19,427 --> 00:44:21,361
Bluebirds

672
00:44:21,429 --> 00:44:23,056
Singin' a song

673
00:44:23,131 --> 00:44:26,328
-Are you a doctor?
-No. I'm a medical student.

674
00:44:26,401 --> 00:44:29,837
But if there's anything
I can do to help you-

675
00:44:29,905 --> 00:44:32,840
-You wanna help me?
-Oh, yeah. What can I do?

676
00:44:32,908 --> 00:44:34,842
Listen, you little
do-gooder prick.

677
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:37,845
If you wanna make yourself feel good,
don't make me pay for it.

678
00:44:37,913 --> 00:44:40,404
Now get out of here,
'cause you don't help shit!

679
00:45:03,538 --> 00:45:06,302
Dr. Maslow, line 214, please.

680
00:45:06,374 --> 00:45:08,808
Dr. Maslow, line 214.

681
00:45:10,745 --> 00:45:13,839
Yo! Ride 'em, cowboy!
Whoo-hoo!

682
00:45:13,915 --> 00:45:17,112
Yea!

683
00:45:19,688 --> 00:45:22,816
Oh! Oh! I surrender!
I'll tell you what you want to know!

684
00:45:22,891 --> 00:45:25,826
Do you wanna tell me what it is
you think you're doing?

685
00:45:27,295 --> 00:45:28,762
Oh.

686
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:34,134
Uh...

687
00:45:34,202 --> 00:45:36,136
just getting
a few laughs, sir.

688
00:45:37,939 --> 00:45:40,874
The American Journal of Medicine
has found that laughter...

689
00:45:40,942 --> 00:45:42,967
increases secretion
of catecholamines and endorphins...

690
00:45:43,044 --> 00:45:45,308
which in turn increases oxygenation
of the blood, relaxes the arteries...

691
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:48,315
speeds up the heart,
decreases blood pressure...

692
00:45:48,383 --> 00:45:51,318
which has a positive effect on all
cardiovascular and respiratory ailments...

693
00:45:51,386 --> 00:45:54,480
as well as overall increasing
the immune system response.

694
00:46:02,297 --> 00:46:04,026
Smart clown, eh?

695
00:46:08,903 --> 00:46:10,803
Mr. Adams.

696
00:46:10,872 --> 00:46:13,807
When I told you
I knew Dr. Prack...

697
00:46:13,875 --> 00:46:17,811
did I mislead you in some way
to think I'm a pushover, like he is?

698
00:46:17,879 --> 00:46:20,313
Kindly remove that coat.

699
00:46:20,382 --> 00:46:24,250
I told you you are not to see
the patients till the third year.

700
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:26,253
I'm just visiting friends, sir.

701
00:46:26,321 --> 00:46:28,255
Why are you here?

702
00:46:28,323 --> 00:46:31,258
If you want to be a clown,
go join the circus.

703
00:46:31,326 --> 00:46:34,261
Patients don't need to be entertained.
They don't need a friend.

704
00:46:34,329 --> 00:46:37,264
They need a doctor.

705
00:46:37,332 --> 00:46:40,301
I don't want to see you
in this hospital again.

706
00:46:40,368 --> 00:46:44,065
What if I visit the patients
on my own time?

707
00:46:44,139 --> 00:46:47,074
Yes, about your own time.

708
00:46:47,142 --> 00:46:50,373
It's been brought to our attention
that perhaps we should be suspicious...

709
00:46:50,445 --> 00:46:52,379
of the level
of your grades.

710
00:46:52,447 --> 00:46:54,347
What are you saying?
I'm cheating?

711
00:46:54,416 --> 00:46:58,079
Your scores are among the top in
your class, yet you never seem to study.

712
00:46:58,153 --> 00:47:00,121
That's ridiculous.

713
00:47:00,188 --> 00:47:02,588
Your classmates
don't seem to think so.

714
00:47:02,657 --> 00:47:05,057
Really. Who?

715
00:47:05,126 --> 00:47:09,222
I'm warning you.
Stay out of this hospital.

716
00:47:20,542 --> 00:47:22,476
You told Walcott I cheated.

717
00:47:22,544 --> 00:47:25,479
I know you did it.
Just tell me why.

718
00:47:25,547 --> 00:47:27,481
Look, cut the crap, Hunter.

719
00:47:27,549 --> 00:47:30,484
I live with you. I know how much
you study, or don't study.

720
00:47:30,552 --> 00:47:34,113
And you do better than me?
Give me a break.

721
00:47:34,189 --> 00:47:39,126
You arrogant, pompous prick! Who appointed
you custodian of the medical profession?

722
00:47:39,194 --> 00:47:43,062
Is it because your father and his father
was a doctor, some sort of genetic thing?

723
00:47:43,131 --> 00:47:45,224
-You're damn right.
-Really?

724
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,234
I grew up with it.

725
00:47:47,302 --> 00:47:50,760
I know what it takes to look in the eyes
of dying people day after day...

726
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:52,773
and come home
for dinner at night.

727
00:47:52,841 --> 00:47:56,106
-I know what it takes. You don't have it.
-Oh, really. And you do?

728
00:47:56,177 --> 00:47:58,907
If you don't like me,
just say it.

729
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:01,073
I don't like you!

730
00:48:01,149 --> 00:48:04,482
Why don't you like me?
You're a prick, and I like you.

731
00:48:04,552 --> 00:48:06,679
Because you make
my effort a joke!

732
00:48:06,755 --> 00:48:10,088
I want to be a doctor!
This isn't a game to me!

733
00:48:10,158 --> 00:48:12,353
This isn't playtime!

734
00:48:12,427 --> 00:48:15,191
This is serious business!

735
00:48:15,263 --> 00:48:18,824
I have it in me
to be a great doctor...

736
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:22,597
but in order to do that I have to
sacrifice if I want to be better.

737
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:24,604
"Better. "
Better than me, hmm?

738
00:48:24,672 --> 00:48:27,607
I will save lives that
could have otherwise not been saved.

739
00:48:27,675 --> 00:48:31,111
Now, I could be like you and go around
laughing and have a good time, ha ha...

740
00:48:31,179 --> 00:48:34,114
but I prefer to learn,
because the more I learn...

741
00:48:34,182 --> 00:48:37,379
the more likely I will have the right answer
at the crucial moment and save a life.

742
00:48:37,452 --> 00:48:40,182
And you say I'm a prick?
You say I'm a prick?

743
00:48:40,255 --> 00:48:42,189
You know, maybe I am...

744
00:48:42,257 --> 00:48:45,192
but you ask the average person, when
death comes knocking at their door...

745
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:48,696
whether they want a prick on their side
or some kindergarten teacher...

746
00:48:48,763 --> 00:48:50,697
who's gonna kiss their ass!

747
00:48:50,765 --> 00:48:53,700
Because when that day comes
I want the prick...

748
00:48:53,768 --> 00:48:55,702
and so will you.

749
00:49:06,781 --> 00:49:10,114
You know, I forget
how young you are, Mitch...

750
00:49:10,185 --> 00:49:13,279
that you think you have to be a prick
to get things done...

751
00:49:13,354 --> 00:49:16,790
and that you actually think
that that's a new idea.

752
00:49:30,572 --> 00:49:34,008
You know what I oughta do?
Take it to the state medical board.

753
00:49:34,075 --> 00:49:37,841
There's gotta be some constitutional
right for visiting the sick.

754
00:49:41,449 --> 00:49:43,383
Why don't you
say anything?

755
00:49:43,451 --> 00:49:45,715
Sorry, Patch.

756
00:49:45,787 --> 00:49:47,721
I think Walcott
has a point.

757
00:49:47,789 --> 00:49:49,552
It's a hospital.

758
00:49:49,624 --> 00:49:52,718
People are suffering
and dying.

759
00:49:52,794 --> 00:49:57,697
We're all dying, Truman.
Our job is to increase health.

760
00:49:57,765 --> 00:49:59,699
You know what that means?

761
00:49:59,767 --> 00:50:02,895
That means improving the quality
of life, not just delaying death.

762
00:50:04,405 --> 00:50:06,339
Either way, I-

763
00:50:06,407 --> 00:50:11,743
For your own sake, I th-I think you
should just lay low for a while.

764
00:50:13,214 --> 00:50:15,148
Maybe you're right.

765
00:50:40,975 --> 00:50:44,467
Preview of coming attractions.

766
00:50:44,545 --> 00:50:46,479
Nurse.

767
00:50:46,547 --> 00:50:52,348
"Death. To die. To expire.
To pass on. To perish. "

768
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:54,782
To peg out. To push up daisies.
To push up posies.

769
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:56,647
To become extinct.

770
00:50:56,719 --> 00:51:00,985
Curtains, deceased, demised,
departed and defunct.

771
00:51:01,057 --> 00:51:03,082
Dead as a doornail.
Dead as a herring.

772
00:51:03,159 --> 00:51:05,650
Dead as a mutton.
Dead as nits.

773
00:51:05,728 --> 00:51:10,461
The last breath. Paying a debt
to nature. The big sleep.

774
00:51:10,533 --> 00:51:13,661
God's way of saying,
"Slow down. "

775
00:51:26,048 --> 00:51:27,982
To check out.

776
00:51:31,153 --> 00:51:33,621
To shuffle off
this mortal coil.

777
00:51:33,689 --> 00:51:35,953
To head for
the happy hunting ground.

778
00:51:36,025 --> 00:51:38,619
To blink for an exceptionally long
period of time.

779
00:51:38,694 --> 00:51:41,185
To find oneself
without breath.

780
00:51:41,263 --> 00:51:45,029
-To be the incredible decaying man.
-Worm buffet.

781
00:51:45,101 --> 00:51:47,126
-Kick the bucket.
-Buy the farm.

782
00:51:47,203 --> 00:51:49,501
-Take the cab.
-Cash in your chips.

783
00:51:49,572 --> 00:51:52,439
And if we bury you ass up,
we have a place to park my bike.

784
00:51:55,177 --> 00:51:59,113
Whoo! Comin' out of chute number nine,
ridin' that morphine pony!

785
00:51:59,181 --> 00:52:01,046
Whoo-aaah!

786
00:52:01,117 --> 00:52:03,881
Come on now.
Hey, yeah

787
00:52:03,953 --> 00:52:06,888
Let's check out the maternity ward.
You know those chicks put out.

788
00:52:08,791 --> 00:52:13,888
Here we see that the vitreous body
is composed of a transparent jelly...

789
00:52:13,963 --> 00:52:15,897
with a mesh
of collagen fibers.

790
00:52:15,965 --> 00:52:17,899
Lights, please.

791
00:52:17,967 --> 00:52:22,028
Uh, before we adjourn
Dean Walcott has a brief announcement.

792
00:52:22,104 --> 00:52:24,231
He's gonna have the sex change!

793
00:52:25,541 --> 00:52:27,475
Next Monday
the hospital is hosting...

794
00:52:27,543 --> 00:52:29,807
a medical
seminar-slash-retreat...

795
00:52:29,879 --> 00:52:33,178
for the Fellowship of the
American College of Gynecologists.

796
00:52:33,249 --> 00:52:35,240
I'll get the strippers.

797
00:52:35,317 --> 00:52:37,250
It is important that they be
received in a manner suitable...

798
00:52:37,251 --> 00:52:39,187
to their status and position.

799
00:52:39,188 --> 00:52:43,154
I have traditionally selected
an outstanding student...

800
00:52:43,225 --> 00:52:45,318
to head
the welcoming committee.

801
00:52:45,394 --> 00:52:48,488
The time demands are great,
and I wouldn't want to jeopardize...

802
00:52:48,564 --> 00:52:51,499
the academic performance
of a weaker student.

803
00:52:51,567 --> 00:52:53,933
This year I have chosen...

804
00:52:54,003 --> 00:52:55,698
Hunter Adams.

805
00:52:55,771 --> 00:52:57,705
Oh. Well, thank you.

806
00:52:57,773 --> 00:52:59,263
Hunter...

807
00:52:59,341 --> 00:53:02,708
there's a detailed list
of instructions in my office.

808
00:53:02,778 --> 00:53:07,408
Oh, and, uh, the auditorium
could use a good cleaning.

809
00:53:14,123 --> 00:53:18,389
Did you hear him? "In a style according
to their stature and position. "

810
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:22,897
"I am a great doctor!
Worship me! Spread before me!

811
00:53:22,965 --> 00:53:25,399
Who dares stand?"

812
00:53:25,467 --> 00:53:29,733
You know what I'm thinking? Maybe we
should decorate with a western motif.

813
00:53:29,805 --> 00:53:31,739
How about that?
Ah.

814
00:53:31,807 --> 00:53:34,742
Something with stirrups
and a big banner that says...

815
00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:37,745
"Howdy, gyneroos!
Dilated to meet ya!"

816
00:53:37,813 --> 00:53:40,748
-How about that?
-How about just doing it straight?

817
00:53:40,816 --> 00:53:43,751
-What do you mean?
-As in, straight to graduation.

818
00:53:43,819 --> 00:53:48,916
Oh. If anybody has a problem with this,
please, just walk away right now.

819
00:53:53,829 --> 00:53:55,956
Oh.

820
00:53:56,031 --> 00:53:57,965
All right.

821
00:53:58,033 --> 00:54:00,467
Wow! Yes!

822
00:54:00,536 --> 00:54:02,527
Okay.

823
00:54:10,312 --> 00:54:12,246
They're right on time.

824
00:54:12,314 --> 00:54:14,578
Good morning, Doctor.
Welcome to campus. Good to see you.

825
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:16,584
How you doing, Doctor?

826
00:54:16,652 --> 00:54:20,247
Uh, gentlemen, I believe that
you'll find the facilities here...

827
00:54:20,322 --> 00:54:22,415
are just perfect
for your purposes today.

828
00:54:22,491 --> 00:54:25,426
We have everything set up
in the auditorium.

829
00:54:25,494 --> 00:54:27,428
If you'd just follow me-

830
00:54:34,236 --> 00:54:36,761
Welcome, cold-handed ones.

831
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:39,967
It's an honor
to greet-slash-welcome...

832
00:54:40,042 --> 00:54:44,206
so many who have touched so many women
is such a powerful way.

833
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,214
Come on in.

834
00:54:46,282 --> 00:54:48,216
Watch out.
It's a little slippery.

835
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:51,720
And if you think
it's hot out there-Whoa!

836
00:54:51,787 --> 00:54:55,154
Come on!

837
00:54:55,224 --> 00:54:57,818
Get him
in my office now.

838
00:55:00,396 --> 00:55:02,591
All right, gentlemen,
if, uh-Ahem-

839
00:55:02,665 --> 00:55:04,599
if you'd
just follow me.

840
00:55:22,451 --> 00:55:24,749
You wanted
to see me, sir?

841
00:55:25,988 --> 00:55:27,922
You are dismissed.

842
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:29,753
Sir.

843
00:55:29,825 --> 00:55:32,259
From this school.

844
00:55:32,328 --> 00:55:34,262
Kindly remove your things...

845
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:36,662
and vacate the school premises
as soon as possible.

846
00:55:36,732 --> 00:55:38,427
What for?

847
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:41,435
For asking a group of doctors to have
a sense of humor about themselves?

848
00:55:41,503 --> 00:55:44,438
Oh, I have a sense of humor, Hunter.

849
00:55:44,506 --> 00:55:47,441
I find it hilarious that,
as smart as you are...

850
00:55:47,509 --> 00:55:51,206
you could give me an airtight reason
to throw you the hell out of here!

851
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,738
Why am I such a threat
to you, sir?

852
00:55:54,817 --> 00:55:58,514
Because what you want is for us to get down
there on the same level as our patients...

853
00:55:58,587 --> 00:56:00,521
to destroy objectivity...

854
00:56:00,589 --> 00:56:03,524
all to uphold some
idealistic buddy system...

855
00:56:03,592 --> 00:56:08,359
that will allow you to work through
your own feelings of inadequacy.

856
00:56:11,934 --> 00:56:14,266
What you have done here today...

857
00:56:14,336 --> 00:56:16,270
is inexcusable.

858
00:56:16,338 --> 00:56:19,865
You have made a complete mockery
out of our distinguished guests.

859
00:56:19,942 --> 00:56:21,439
And if you think for one minute...

860
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:25,640
that I will further tolerate your
blatant disregard of the bylaws of this-

861
00:56:26,181 --> 00:56:28,115
What are you smiling at?

862
00:56:28,183 --> 00:56:30,811
Is this all
a big joke to you?

863
00:56:30,886 --> 00:56:33,150
Get out of here!

864
00:56:43,532 --> 00:56:46,467
Blatant disregard for
school code and procedure.

865
00:56:46,535 --> 00:56:48,969
Defying direct orders
from a dean.

866
00:56:49,038 --> 00:56:51,973
And I am aware
of your creative efforts...

867
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:54,976
to make sure our visiting gynecologists
feel right at home.

868
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:57,843
Now, what is it you'd
like me to do for you?

869
00:56:57,844 --> 00:56:59,744
I want to graduate, sir.

870
00:56:59,815 --> 00:57:01,680
Dean Walcott
thinks otherwise...

871
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:04,150
but my grades
are way above par.

872
00:57:04,219 --> 00:57:07,154
I want to finish school
so I can become a doctor.

873
00:57:07,222 --> 00:57:10,157
Well, I'm gonna give this
to you real straight.

874
00:57:10,225 --> 00:57:13,160
I have a hospital and a medical school
to run here.

875
00:57:13,228 --> 00:57:15,355
I have to trust the people
in my employ...

876
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:18,366
otherwise their quality of life
will turn to shit.

877
00:57:18,434 --> 00:57:20,925
Their life turns to shit,
my life turns to shit. Do you follow?

878
00:57:21,003 --> 00:57:23,938
-Yes.
-Good.

879
00:57:24,006 --> 00:57:28,272
Now, uh, Dean Walcott is a-
a pain in the ass...

880
00:57:28,343 --> 00:57:32,871
but I depend on him to keep me up to
speed on what's going on around here...

881
00:57:32,948 --> 00:57:36,384
and I would never take the word
of any student over his.

882
00:57:37,519 --> 00:57:39,180
However...

883
00:57:39,254 --> 00:57:43,190
I also have a source
that informs me that your antics...

884
00:57:43,258 --> 00:57:46,193
have improved the quality of life
for the patients.

885
00:57:46,261 --> 00:57:49,196
They don't complain as much,
they take less medication...

886
00:57:49,264 --> 00:57:52,358
and, uh, what's-his-name over in 305
has not thrown his bedpan at a nurse...

887
00:57:52,434 --> 00:57:54,368
in over a week.

888
00:57:54,436 --> 00:57:57,132
-It's Bill.
-Yeah, whatever.

889
00:57:57,206 --> 00:58:00,573
So, from now on you will not
enter that hospital...

890
00:58:00,642 --> 00:58:04,169
unless under the supervision of the
attendant, as part of the curriculum...

891
00:58:04,246 --> 00:58:07,977
and you will steer clear
of Dean Walcott.

892
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:11,713
Yes, sir.
So I'm still in school?

893
00:58:11,787 --> 00:58:13,721
I wouldn't
send my laundry out...

894
00:58:13,789 --> 00:58:16,314
but, uh, you just
don't screw up, huh?

895
00:58:31,158 --> 00:58:34,127
Come in. Please come in.

896
00:58:34,195 --> 00:58:36,686
Hello?

897
00:58:36,764 --> 00:58:39,232
-Hello.
-Patch?

898
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:41,734
-Welcome.
-What are you doing?

899
00:58:41,802 --> 00:58:45,761
-I thought we were studying.
-We're studying cellular biology.

900
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:48,706
Where are you?

901
00:58:48,776 --> 00:58:50,710
Somewhere.

902
00:58:50,778 --> 00:58:53,110
Surprise!

903
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:55,671
-Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday!

904
00:58:55,749 --> 00:58:57,717
I don't believe this.
Where is he?

905
00:58:57,785 --> 00:59:00,276
-I just saw him around here somewhere.
-Where is he, Truman?

906
00:59:00,354 --> 00:59:02,879
He's here. You gotta find him.

907
00:59:02,957 --> 00:59:04,891
-Patch?
-Ha-ha!

908
00:59:08,529 --> 00:59:11,589
"I do not love you as if
you were a salt rose or topaz...

909
00:59:11,665 --> 00:59:15,396
or the air o'er carnations
that fire shoots off.

910
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:18,097
I love you as certain dark
things are to be loved...

911
00:59:18,172 --> 00:59:21,573
in secret 'tween
the shadow and the soul. "

912
00:59:24,078 --> 00:59:26,012
We'll finish it later.

913
00:59:27,147 --> 00:59:30,139
What the hell is this?
Hunter.

914
00:59:30,217 --> 00:59:32,276
Hunter, please answer me!

915
00:59:32,353 --> 00:59:35,516
Stop laughing! Truman, I see you!

916
00:59:35,589 --> 00:59:39,389
Who the hell are you? You aren't-

917
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:41,655
Oh! Oh, damn it!

918
00:59:41,729 --> 00:59:46,359
I hurt my ankle!
Somebody get somebody please!

919
00:59:46,433 --> 00:59:50,199
Someone-Hello? My ankle!

920
00:59:50,271 --> 00:59:53,365
You could have saved yourself
a lot of trouble and just asked me out.

921
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,876
Who said anything
about asking you out?

922
00:59:58,012 --> 01:00:00,139
I heard something
about you.

923
01:00:00,214 --> 01:00:03,115
-That I was in a mental hospital?
-Is it true?

924
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:05,117
Tried to kill myself.

925
01:00:05,185 --> 01:00:08,313
The mental ward was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

926
01:00:09,890 --> 01:00:14,384
-What did the doctors do to help you?
-The doctors didn't help me.

927
01:00:14,461 --> 01:00:16,986
The patients helped me.

928
01:00:17,064 --> 01:00:21,558
They helped me realize that by helping them
I could forget about my own problems.

929
01:00:21,635 --> 01:00:25,537
And I did.
I really helped some of them.

930
01:00:25,606 --> 01:00:29,007
It was an incredible
feeling, Carin.

931
01:00:30,144 --> 01:00:33,375
There was one patient
named Rudy.

932
01:00:33,447 --> 01:00:36,439
I helped him
be able to pee.

933
01:00:36,517 --> 01:00:40,920
But for the first time in my life,
I forgot about my own problems.

934
01:00:40,988 --> 01:00:43,320
It was an incredible high.

935
01:00:45,592 --> 01:00:47,526
What?

936
01:00:49,196 --> 01:00:53,860
It's just that, um, somebody,
you know, could do for me...

937
01:00:53,934 --> 01:00:57,700
what you did for me tonight
after the way I've treated you.

938
01:00:57,771 --> 01:01:01,571
No one's ever done anything
like that for me before.

939
01:01:06,647 --> 01:01:08,581
Thank you.

940
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:11,584
Good night.

941
01:01:14,788 --> 01:01:19,020
No, this is not a good night.
This is a great night!

942
01:01:19,093 --> 01:01:21,721
You know?

943
01:01:53,127 --> 01:01:56,119
Hi, I'm John the Baptist.
Any calls?

944
01:01:56,196 --> 01:01:59,097
I've been trying
to reach you.

945
01:02:00,434 --> 01:02:03,460
I love you.

946
01:02:05,539 --> 01:02:08,133
Let's go outside. Okay?

947
01:02:24,558 --> 01:02:27,925
Hey, Bill.

948
01:02:27,995 --> 01:02:30,793
Turquoise is a nice color
on you.

949
01:02:35,369 --> 01:02:38,304
You don't have to say anything.
I know I look good.

950
01:02:41,308 --> 01:02:43,242
My boys.

951
01:02:45,379 --> 01:02:47,939
My boys are beautiful, hmm?

952
01:02:48,015 --> 01:02:51,143
-Yeah.
-Did you see my boys?

953
01:02:51,218 --> 01:02:53,209
Yeah.

954
01:02:54,288 --> 01:02:57,621
She's not bad either.

955
01:02:57,691 --> 01:03:00,626
You think after you're gone,
maybe I could-

956
01:03:03,664 --> 01:03:08,226
Oh, you're killin' me here,
Patch.

957
01:03:17,244 --> 01:03:21,078
S-Sing me that stupid song.

958
01:03:25,819 --> 01:03:29,277
Blue skies smilin' at me

959
01:03:29,356 --> 01:03:32,018
Nothin' but blue skies

960
01:03:32,092 --> 01:03:35,027
Do I see

961
01:03:35,095 --> 01:03:38,292
Bluebirds singin' a song

962
01:03:39,466 --> 01:03:42,128
Nothin' but bluebirds

963
01:03:42,202 --> 01:03:44,295
All day long

964
01:03:55,849 --> 01:03:58,079
Blue days

965
01:03:58,151 --> 01:04:01,052
All of them gone

966
01:04:02,556 --> 01:04:06,048
Nothin' but blue skies

967
01:04:06,126 --> 01:04:08,560
From now on

968
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:15,234
See you, Bill.

969
01:04:32,886 --> 01:04:35,821
Por favor. Dejeme ver a mi nina!

970
01:04:35,889 --> 01:04:38,187
-I'm sorry, ma'am.
-Somebody speak-Alguien, ayudeme!

971
01:04:38,258 --> 01:04:41,091
-Dejeme ver a mi nina!
-I need the forms filled out.

972
01:04:41,161 --> 01:04:43,459
My baby! My baby!

973
01:04:43,530 --> 01:04:46,988
Ma'am, if you fill out the forms,
you can see her in a moment.

974
01:04:47,067 --> 01:04:49,160
-Alguien-
-Excuse me.

975
01:04:49,236 --> 01:04:50,499
What's going on here?

976
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:52,970
Oh, drunk driver.
She lost her husband and son.

977
01:04:52,973 --> 01:04:56,039
Her daughter's in Trauma One,
but it doesn't look good.

978
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:57,009
I need the forms filled out.

979
01:04:57,010 --> 01:04:59,973
-Please! Quiero ver a mi nina!
-You can see her in one moment.

980
01:05:00,047 --> 01:05:03,278
Quiero ver a mi nina!
My baby! Please!

981
01:05:03,350 --> 01:05:06,012
Maybe you could explain
it to me so I might understand it.

982
01:05:06,086 --> 01:05:08,020
It's hospital procedure.

983
01:05:08,088 --> 01:05:11,615
It isn't right that a woman has to spend
the last moments of her dying child...

984
01:05:11,692 --> 01:05:13,626
filling out forms.

985
01:05:13,694 --> 01:05:15,992
Last year I had to have my appendix out.

986
01:05:16,063 --> 01:05:19,590
I forgot my insurance card,
so they sent me home.

987
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:22,100
My appendix could have burst.
They didn't care.

988
01:05:22,169 --> 01:05:26,071
You know, my antibiotics
cost 100 bucks a month.

989
01:05:26,139 --> 01:05:29,575
I paid $250 just to find out
I had a sprained ankle.

990
01:05:29,643 --> 01:05:32,306
I mean, do they really
need to do all those tests?

991
01:05:32,307 --> 01:05:33,707
You know what they need to do.

992
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:35,644
The government needs
to pay for health insurance.

993
01:05:35,716 --> 01:05:39,550
Health insurance companies are why
prices got so high in the first place.

994
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:42,453
-What do we do?
-Yeah, what the hell is the answer?

995
01:05:42,522 --> 01:05:45,650
-Don't hurt your ankle.
-Yeah, right.

996
01:05:50,797 --> 01:05:54,198
-Patch?
-Mm-hmm. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

997
01:06:04,611 --> 01:06:07,580
That's it.

998
01:06:09,383 --> 01:06:11,317
-I gotta tell Carin.
-What?

999
01:06:11,385 --> 01:06:13,012
Oh.

1000
01:06:13,086 --> 01:06:15,520
-Can I borrow this stuff?
-Sure.

1001
01:06:27,155 --> 01:06:29,521
-What do you see?
-Patch, it's late.

1002
01:06:29,591 --> 01:06:31,991
What do you see?

1003
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:34,585
Parsley.

1004
01:06:34,663 --> 01:06:36,597
-And a horn.
-No, no, no.

1005
01:06:36,665 --> 01:06:39,691
Look beyond the objects.
Look through them.

1006
01:06:39,768 --> 01:06:42,862
Over here. Look.

1007
01:06:42,937 --> 01:06:45,667
Kind of let them blur.
Tell me the first thing you see.

1008
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:48,004
-Something with a nose.
-Okay.

1009
01:06:48,076 --> 01:06:50,738
Now imagine that's a building
with a nose.

1010
01:06:50,812 --> 01:06:54,077
-A free hospital.
-A free hospital.

1011
01:06:54,149 --> 01:06:56,083
-Can I go back to bed now?
-No, no.

1012
01:06:56,151 --> 01:06:58,619
Because I'm bursting with ideas,
and I need you to help me.

1013
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:01,850
It'll be the first fun hospital
in the world.

1014
01:07:01,923 --> 01:07:04,016
It'll be a totally
free-form building.

1015
01:07:04,092 --> 01:07:07,425
It'll have, like, slides
and secret passageways and game rooms.

1016
01:07:07,495 --> 01:07:10,328
-Slow down. I can't write that fast.
-I can't slow down.

1017
01:07:10,398 --> 01:07:13,458
We'll use humor
to heal pain and suffering.

1018
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:16,231
Doctors and patients
will work side-by-side as peers.

1019
01:07:16,304 --> 01:07:18,966
There'll be no titles,
no bosses.

1020
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:23,306
People will come from all over the world to
fulfill their dream of helping other people.

1021
01:07:23,378 --> 01:07:25,846
They'll be a community
where joy is a way of life...

1022
01:07:25,914 --> 01:07:30,180
where learning is the highest aim,
where love is the ultimate goal.

1023
01:07:30,251 --> 01:07:31,318
You have all that?

1024
01:07:31,319 --> 01:07:33,687
Yeah, not verbatim,
but the overall insanity's intact.

1025
01:07:33,688 --> 01:07:35,622
-That's why you have to help me.
-Patch, no.

1026
01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:37,487
-Yes.
-No.

1027
01:07:37,559 --> 01:07:41,222
I know it's not gonna be easy, but you
said anything worth doing is difficult.

1028
01:07:41,296 --> 01:07:43,423
Look, um-

1029
01:07:43,498 --> 01:07:46,160
I'm not like you, Patch.

1030
01:07:46,234 --> 01:07:49,697
I want the white coat. I want people
to call me doctor more than anything.

1031
01:07:49,771 --> 01:07:51,101
I want the recognition.

1032
01:07:51,102 --> 01:07:53,802
You'll get it every day in the
eyes of patients you're helping.

1033
01:07:53,975 --> 01:07:57,270
There is more to life than
what Dean Walcott puts out there.

1034
01:07:57,345 --> 01:08:01,406
That is all about power
and control, all right?

1035
01:08:01,483 --> 01:08:04,043
-I know you're scared.
-You're right. I am scared.

1036
01:08:04,119 --> 01:08:06,053
I'm scared to death.

1037
01:08:09,557 --> 01:08:13,789
You know, you sit here and you talk
about life without limits...

1038
01:08:13,862 --> 01:08:16,729
you know,
and breaking the rules.

1039
01:08:16,798 --> 01:08:19,733
It all sounds
very, very romantic.

1040
01:08:21,336 --> 01:08:24,567
You wanna know what the truth
is about all that crap, Patch, hmm?

1041
01:08:24,639 --> 01:08:27,301
People get hurt.

1042
01:08:29,310 --> 01:08:31,244
And who did it to you?

1043
01:08:35,383 --> 01:08:36,875
I have to go.

1044
01:08:36,876 --> 01:08:38,876
No, don't. Please. No, no.
Listen to me. Come on.

1045
01:08:38,953 --> 01:08:41,148
Whatever it is-Come on.
You can tell me.

1046
01:08:41,222 --> 01:08:43,656
-I can help you. I swear I can.
-Good night. I'll see you tomorrow.

1047
01:08:43,725 --> 01:08:46,785
Please, let me help you.

1048
01:08:46,861 --> 01:08:49,796
I'm really starting to love
the back of your head.

1049
01:09:09,117 --> 01:09:12,678
Get this cleaned out,
and get him down to the suture room.

1050
01:09:12,754 --> 01:09:14,688
You're gonna be fine, Larry.

1051
01:09:16,324 --> 01:09:19,293
Larry's been in and out of
the E.R. for a couple of years.

1052
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:22,625
-Not because he's accident-prone.
-No. His father died two years ago.

1053
01:09:22,697 --> 01:09:25,894
Since then he's been subject to fits
of depression and self-mutilation.

1054
01:09:25,967 --> 01:09:28,162
Head trauma, D-5.

1055
01:09:31,906 --> 01:09:35,774
-Thank you for doing this.
-You can thank me by not getting me fired.

1056
01:09:35,844 --> 01:09:39,575
Just observe rounds
and stay within hospital protocol.

1057
01:09:39,647 --> 01:09:41,581
Look, Patch.

1058
01:09:41,649 --> 01:09:44,311
You're a good thing
for this hospital.

1059
01:09:44,385 --> 01:09:46,580
You remind me of myself
when I first started out-

1060
01:09:46,654 --> 01:09:49,088
on fire,
wanting to save the world.

1061
01:09:49,157 --> 01:09:51,853
But you lose a little of that
after a while.

1062
01:09:51,926 --> 01:09:54,724
The system is what it is. It's not
perfect, but it's all we have.

1063
01:09:54,796 --> 01:09:58,755
Why does it have to be all we have?
Why can't it be changed?

1064
01:09:58,833 --> 01:10:01,734
You figure out how, Patch...

1065
01:10:01,803 --> 01:10:03,737
and I'll be there for you.

1066
01:10:03,805 --> 01:10:07,832
Bed six
needs blood work.

1067
01:10:07,909 --> 01:10:10,844
Mrs. O'Bannon
needs blood work.

1068
01:10:12,046 --> 01:10:15,038
Hello, Ed.
You feeling a little dizzy?

1069
01:10:15,116 --> 01:10:17,550
-Yeah.
-Hello, Mrs. O'Bannon.

1070
01:10:17,619 --> 01:10:19,484
-May I call you Catherine?
-Mm-hmm.

1071
01:10:19,485 --> 01:10:20,885
We're gonna draw a little blood.

1072
01:10:20,955 --> 01:10:23,753
Can you tell how many fingers
I'm holding up?

1073
01:10:25,627 --> 01:10:27,561
How many do you see?

1074
01:10:27,629 --> 01:10:29,563
How many fingers?

1075
01:10:33,568 --> 01:10:36,002
How many fingers do you see, Ed?

1076
01:10:46,147 --> 01:10:48,638
How much longer do I have
to keep my eyes closed?

1077
01:10:48,716 --> 01:10:50,650
Just till I open mine.

1078
01:10:50,718 --> 01:10:52,879
Keep 'em closed.

1079
01:10:52,954 --> 01:10:55,548
You're almost there.

1080
01:11:04,265 --> 01:11:06,426
Not like that. This way.

1081
01:11:06,501 --> 01:11:08,992
Come on. Come on.

1082
01:11:09,070 --> 01:11:11,436
There you go.
All right.

1083
01:11:11,506 --> 01:11:14,373
Here, here.
Hold on to me.

1084
01:11:14,442 --> 01:11:16,569
It's just a little further.
Just a little further.

1085
01:11:16,644 --> 01:11:18,839
-All right, all right.
-There you go.

1086
01:11:18,913 --> 01:11:21,177
There you are.
That's all right.

1087
01:11:21,249 --> 01:11:23,183
-You're almost there.
-I'm afraid.

1088
01:11:23,251 --> 01:11:25,549
Don't be afraid.
It's gonna be worth it.

1089
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:28,088
All right. Ready?
Watch your step.

1090
01:11:28,156 --> 01:11:31,990
There you go.
And... open your eyes.

1091
01:11:34,062 --> 01:11:35,996
It's beautiful.

1092
01:11:36,064 --> 01:11:38,931
It's 105 acres
of all-natural forest.

1093
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,697
Seven streams, two waterfalls.

1094
01:11:42,770 --> 01:11:46,206
This is it-the future site
of the Gesundheit Institute.

1095
01:11:47,442 --> 01:11:49,376
This is yours?

1096
01:11:49,444 --> 01:11:52,845
Not yet,
but it will be soon.

1097
01:11:52,914 --> 01:11:55,348
-Come on. There's something else.
-Hmm?

1098
01:12:04,592 --> 01:12:06,526
What is it?

1099
01:12:07,729 --> 01:12:10,061
Our new home.

1100
01:12:10,131 --> 01:12:12,691
Carin, what do you think?

1101
01:12:13,768 --> 01:12:17,204
-How did you... find this?
-Him.

1102
01:12:17,271 --> 01:12:21,640
Arthur Mendelson. All this is his-
the land, the cottage.

1103
01:12:21,709 --> 01:12:24,075
He's letting us borrow it
till we can purchase it.

1104
01:12:24,145 --> 01:12:27,478
Mr. Mendelson, I realize that under
the terms of your commitment...

1105
01:12:27,548 --> 01:12:29,778
you retained control
of your assets.

1106
01:12:29,851 --> 01:12:30,613
Nevertheless-

1107
01:12:30,614 --> 01:12:32,514
You learn anything about
proctology yet, Patch?

1108
01:12:32,587 --> 01:12:34,521
-A little bit.
-Good.

1109
01:12:34,589 --> 01:12:37,057
Take care of this asshole
for me, will ya?

1110
01:12:37,125 --> 01:12:41,459
-Nice meeting you.
-Yeah. Mr. Mendelson, uh-

1111
01:12:41,529 --> 01:12:44,054
There's room for you.

1112
01:12:45,666 --> 01:12:48,499
-Hi, Bile.
-Hey, Patch.

1113
01:12:48,569 --> 01:12:50,628
-Who's Bile?
-An old friend.

1114
01:12:50,705 --> 01:12:53,173
-Oh.
-Without medical insurance.

1115
01:12:53,241 --> 01:12:55,709
He's just staying here
a couple of days.

1116
01:12:55,777 --> 01:12:58,211
What do you say?

1117
01:13:04,652 --> 01:13:06,586
Think potential.

1118
01:13:14,796 --> 01:13:16,489
Hey.

1119
01:13:30,378 --> 01:13:33,472
You're certainly a lovely couple.
We can't go on meeting like this.

1120
01:13:36,551 --> 01:13:38,485
Ma'am, this card is expired.

1121
01:13:38,553 --> 01:13:40,453
Have you a valid card?

1122
01:13:40,521 --> 01:13:44,287
Huh? Medicine.
Chinese medicine.

1123
01:14:25,133 --> 01:14:28,591
Yeah, yeah. That's painful there.

1124
01:14:28,669 --> 01:14:31,968
Uh, hang on a second.
I only have one arm.

1125
01:14:32,039 --> 01:14:33,973
Gesundheit.

1126
01:14:34,041 --> 01:14:37,272
-Let's go!
-Yeah. Uh-huh.

1127
01:14:39,213 --> 01:14:42,341
Uh-huh. Yeah.

1128
01:14:42,416 --> 01:14:45,715
Hi. How can we help you?

1129
01:14:46,788 --> 01:14:48,722
I don't know.

1130
01:14:48,790 --> 01:14:51,725
Uh, I h-heard about this place...

1131
01:14:51,793 --> 01:14:55,593
and I, I thought maybe
I would get some, uh-

1132
01:14:55,663 --> 01:14:58,860
You know, maybe I'd talk to somebody,
because my thoughts-

1133
01:14:58,933 --> 01:15:01,401
This is crazy.

1134
01:15:01,469 --> 01:15:04,267
Word's getting out we're handling the
overflow from three different clinics now.

1135
01:15:04,338 --> 01:15:08,240
I start my pediatric clerkship next week.
I don't know how I'm gonna... keep up.

1136
01:15:08,309 --> 01:15:11,301
Anybody call for a doctor in here?

1137
01:15:11,379 --> 01:15:13,643
Let's try this right now.
There. Look at that there.

1138
01:15:13,714 --> 01:15:16,979
Hey, thank you, Judy and Cissy,
for that lovely medicine.

1139
01:15:19,821 --> 01:15:23,689
-How you feeling, Frank? You feel better?
-Yeah, feel better.

1140
01:15:23,758 --> 01:15:26,352
Well, keep on your medication. You can
never go wrong if you're a Marxist.

1141
01:15:26,427 --> 01:15:28,395
Hey, Patch?

1142
01:15:28,462 --> 01:15:30,453
-Yes?
-This is, um-I didn't get your name.

1143
01:15:30,531 --> 01:15:33,193
-Uh, Larry.
-Hi, Larry. How are you?

1144
01:15:33,267 --> 01:15:35,394
-Good.
-Nice to meet you.

1145
01:15:35,469 --> 01:15:37,994
What are you passionate about, Larry?
What excites you?

1146
01:15:38,072 --> 01:15:40,597
-What turns you on?
-I like to read.

1147
01:15:40,675 --> 01:15:42,905
I love to read. What do you like
to read? Who's your favorite author?

1148
01:15:42,977 --> 01:15:45,343
-Mmm, Kazantzakis.
-Kazantzakis.

1149
01:15:45,413 --> 01:15:49,474
Oh. "World is trouble.
Man needs a little madness, or else-"

1150
01:15:49,550 --> 01:15:51,780
"Or else he dare not
cut the rope and be free. "

1151
01:15:51,853 --> 01:15:53,787
That's great, Larry.
That's wonderful.

1152
01:15:53,855 --> 01:15:55,789
We're gonna get along just fine.
Truman.

1153
01:15:55,857 --> 01:15:57,120
Yeah, Patch. What?

1154
01:15:57,121 --> 01:15:58,921
Can you come over here
and show Larry around?

1155
01:15:59,093 --> 01:16:01,857
-Nice having you here, Larry. Welcome.
-Thanks. Okay.

1156
01:16:05,166 --> 01:16:09,034
-I've seen Larry in the E.R. before.
-He's weird.

1157
01:16:09,103 --> 01:16:12,504
I'm weird. If we don't
show him compassion, who will?

1158
01:16:18,779 --> 01:16:22,476
What's that name again? Right.

1159
01:16:44,005 --> 01:16:45,939
-Hi.
-Hi.

1160
01:16:57,251 --> 01:16:59,515
-Everyone asleep?
-Yeah.

1161
01:16:59,587 --> 01:17:01,521
But it ain't me.

1162
01:17:07,628 --> 01:17:09,562
You okay?

1163
01:17:12,166 --> 01:17:14,100
-Yeah.
-Hmm.

1164
01:17:19,106 --> 01:17:21,472
God, Patch, it's amazing.

1165
01:17:21,542 --> 01:17:23,476
What?

1166
01:17:23,544 --> 01:17:27,275
Just what you've done
with this place, you know.

1167
01:17:27,348 --> 01:17:29,782
-You too.
-Well.

1168
01:17:32,753 --> 01:17:34,687
These people
that we're helping-

1169
01:17:34,755 --> 01:17:37,189
they would have had
nowhere to go.

1170
01:17:39,593 --> 01:17:41,527
You're a good man.

1171
01:17:53,674 --> 01:17:55,972
What are we?

1172
01:17:57,478 --> 01:17:59,412
Is it me?

1173
01:18:02,516 --> 01:18:07,920
I mean, are we just-are we
good friends that occasionally kiss?

1174
01:18:14,362 --> 01:18:17,126
Patch...

1175
01:18:17,198 --> 01:18:19,166
my entire life...

1176
01:18:19,233 --> 01:18:22,396
men have been...

1177
01:18:22,470 --> 01:18:24,438
attracted to me.

1178
01:18:29,643 --> 01:18:31,577
My entire life.

1179
01:18:41,489 --> 01:18:43,423
When I was a little girl...

1180
01:18:43,491 --> 01:18:46,426
I would look out my bedroom window
at the caterpillars.

1181
01:18:48,295 --> 01:18:50,229
I envied them so much.

1182
01:18:52,333 --> 01:18:54,267
No matter
what they were before...

1183
01:18:54,335 --> 01:18:57,771
no matter...
what happened to them...

1184
01:18:57,838 --> 01:19:02,707
they could just hide away,
you know...

1185
01:19:02,777 --> 01:19:06,873
and turn into these beautiful
creatures that could fly away...

1186
01:19:06,947 --> 01:19:08,881
completely untouched.

1187
01:19:17,425 --> 01:19:20,792
I hated men so much.

1188
01:19:26,133 --> 01:19:28,795
I wanted nothing
to do with them.

1189
01:19:43,184 --> 01:19:45,118
Then I met you.

1190
01:19:49,824 --> 01:19:52,759
The way that
you help people, Patch-

1191
01:19:55,362 --> 01:19:59,230
The changes I see
in everybody that's around you-

1192
01:20:14,882 --> 01:20:16,975
I love you.

1193
01:20:17,051 --> 01:20:21,078
I've loved you for so long.

1194
01:20:55,689 --> 01:20:59,022
You scared me.

1195
01:20:59,093 --> 01:21:01,891
I was watching you sleep.

1196
01:21:01,962 --> 01:21:05,693
I have a real knack.
Impressive, hmm?

1197
01:21:08,469 --> 01:21:11,461
"I love you
without knowing how...

1198
01:21:11,539 --> 01:21:13,837
"or when or from where.

1199
01:21:13,908 --> 01:21:16,069
-I love you straight-"
-Patch.

1200
01:21:18,846 --> 01:21:20,711
Um, sorry.

1201
01:21:20,781 --> 01:21:22,578
It's okay.

1202
01:21:22,650 --> 01:21:25,141
Uh, we have a situation
out here...

1203
01:21:25,219 --> 01:21:27,153
that needs attention.

1204
01:21:31,759 --> 01:21:34,193
I've been trying
to warn you guys about this...

1205
01:21:34,261 --> 01:21:36,195
and now we have
absolutely zero supplies.

1206
01:21:36,263 --> 01:21:38,697
There's an older gentlemen over there.
He has a sprained shoulder.

1207
01:21:38,766 --> 01:21:42,361
I don't have any slings.
I had to wrap his arm in his own belt.

1208
01:21:42,436 --> 01:21:45,803
We have no iodine. We don't even
have any gauze, for God's sake.

1209
01:21:47,174 --> 01:21:50,439
There's an entire supply room
at the hospital.

1210
01:21:50,511 --> 01:21:54,003
That couldn't possibly be because
those supplies belong to the hospital.

1211
01:21:54,081 --> 01:21:56,515
No.
That's too obvious.

1212
01:21:57,985 --> 01:22:02,422
Come on.
I need your feet, and I want your body.

1213
01:22:02,489 --> 01:22:04,514
-Come on.
-Bye.

1214
01:22:04,592 --> 01:22:06,219
Behave.

1215
01:22:06,293 --> 01:22:08,553
Would you hurry, please?
This stuff is crushing me.

1216
01:22:08,554 --> 01:22:09,729
Quiet. You're a corpse.

1217
01:22:09,730 --> 01:22:11,364
-Ow!
-Shh!

1218
01:22:11,432 --> 01:22:13,366
-Ow!
-Damn it!

1219
01:22:13,434 --> 01:22:17,029
-Watch it!
-Quiet. Shut up!

1220
01:22:57,088 --> 01:23:01,115
Yeah, uh, this is Larry.

1221
01:23:01,192 --> 01:23:04,821
Uh, I was wondering i-if
somebody could come over.

1222
01:23:04,895 --> 01:23:06,829
Uh-

1223
01:23:07,898 --> 01:23:09,991
I'm not doin' too well.
Um-

1224
01:23:11,702 --> 01:23:15,399
I was, I was-I-It would help
if I could talk to somebody.

1225
01:23:15,473 --> 01:23:18,271
Uh... okay.

1226
01:23:47,705 --> 01:23:49,639
Hello?

1227
01:24:00,785 --> 01:24:02,719
Larry?

1228
01:24:27,445 --> 01:24:29,379
Larry?

1229
01:24:31,382 --> 01:24:33,316
Are you okay?

1230
01:24:36,053 --> 01:24:40,012
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

1231
01:24:42,093 --> 01:24:44,654
I didn't know you could play.
You sound wonderful.

1232
01:24:44,655 --> 01:24:45,655
Thank you.

1233
01:24:45,730 --> 01:24:49,097
And this house-it's amazing.
Is it yours?

1234
01:24:50,234 --> 01:24:52,668
It's my father's.
He left it to me.

1235
01:24:54,472 --> 01:24:56,406
Here.
Let me take your jacket.

1236
01:24:58,476 --> 01:25:00,410
Sure.

1237
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:06,208
-You okay?
-Yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.

1238
01:25:07,785 --> 01:25:10,219
Uh, come in.
Come in.

1239
01:25:11,188 --> 01:25:13,122
Thanks.

1240
01:25:15,192 --> 01:25:19,219
I really can't stay very long.
I just wanted to see how you were doing.

1241
01:25:20,464 --> 01:25:23,024
Yeah, you're right.

1242
01:25:25,803 --> 01:25:27,896
No, we don't wanna be late.

1243
01:25:41,185 --> 01:25:43,415
Patch.

1244
01:25:43,487 --> 01:25:45,546
-Oh.
-You just got a telephone call.

1245
01:25:45,623 --> 01:25:48,751
Dean Anderson wants to see you
in his office immediately.

1246
01:25:48,826 --> 01:25:52,029
Oh, no. Walcott found out
about our borrowed supplies.

1247
01:25:52,030 --> 01:25:53,430
We're dead.

1248
01:25:53,798 --> 01:25:56,130
Ye of little faith.

1249
01:26:04,608 --> 01:26:08,374
Dean Anderson, I know what this is
all about, and I assure you, sir-

1250
01:26:08,446 --> 01:26:10,380
Sit down.

1251
01:26:16,921 --> 01:26:19,355
Something happened last night.

1252
01:26:21,759 --> 01:26:23,693
Carin Fisher was murdered.

1253
01:26:26,497 --> 01:26:28,863
She was with Lawrence Silver.

1254
01:26:30,501 --> 01:26:33,629
There was a shotgun involved,
and then he turned the gun on himself.

1255
01:26:35,005 --> 01:26:38,532
Jesus Christ, Patch, I'm sorry.
I know she was a friend.

1256
01:26:39,610 --> 01:26:43,444
If there's, um,
anything I can do-

1257
01:26:47,918 --> 01:26:49,852
Hell of a deal.

1258
01:26:55,759 --> 01:26:58,853
"Into Your hands, O Merciful Savior...

1259
01:26:58,929 --> 01:27:01,762
we commend
Your servant Carin.

1260
01:27:01,832 --> 01:27:04,858
Receive her into the arms
of Your mercy,

1261
01:27:04,935 --> 01:27:08,393
into the blessed rest
of everlasting peace,

1262
01:27:08,472 --> 01:27:14,035
and into the glorious company
of the saints... on high. "

1263
01:27:14,111 --> 01:27:16,545
Amen.

1264
01:28:11,168 --> 01:28:13,602
Told you I'd finish it
some other time.

1265
01:28:15,339 --> 01:28:17,273
Guess now's okay.

1266
01:28:20,811 --> 01:28:25,578
"I love you without knowing
how... or when...

1267
01:28:25,649 --> 01:28:27,583
or from where.

1268
01:28:29,987 --> 01:28:35,015
I love you straightforwardly,
without complexities or pride.

1269
01:28:35,092 --> 01:28:38,823
I love you because I know
no other way than this.

1270
01:28:41,131 --> 01:28:43,429
So close...

1271
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:46,663
that your hand on my chest
is my hand.

1272
01:28:48,405 --> 01:28:51,203
So close
that when you close your eyes...

1273
01:28:52,776 --> 01:28:54,767
I fall asleep. "

1274
01:29:06,991 --> 01:29:09,653
I'm sorry, honey! I'm sorry!

1275
01:29:19,603 --> 01:29:22,003
We can't disband.
You know that, right?

1276
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:25,772
What about our patients?
What do we tell them?

1277
01:29:25,843 --> 01:29:28,539
They'll manage.
They managed before.

1278
01:29:28,612 --> 01:29:31,410
-I refuse to quit.
-Good.

1279
01:29:31,482 --> 01:29:34,076
God, you're being
so self-indulgent.

1280
01:29:34,151 --> 01:29:39,316
This has been your vision, but we all built
this place and it belongs to all of us.

1281
01:29:39,390 --> 01:29:41,824
Carin will always remain
within these walls.

1282
01:29:41,892 --> 01:29:44,986
If you walk away from that,
if you let that all die-

1283
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:49,732
I've dedicated
every spare moment I have...

1284
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:54,169
to assisting you in what I believe
is a pure and a good purpose.

1285
01:29:54,238 --> 01:29:57,401
Quitting is not going
to help you get through this.

1286
01:29:57,474 --> 01:29:59,533
-You've always told us-
-Stop it!

1287
01:29:59,610 --> 01:30:01,977
I've always told you what?

1288
01:30:02,111 --> 01:30:05,512
People are good.
Trust people? Ha!

1289
01:30:05,581 --> 01:30:07,515
You know, Truman...

1290
01:30:07,583 --> 01:30:11,519
in all of God's creations, only
human beings kill their own species.

1291
01:30:11,587 --> 01:30:13,851
There's a fun fact
for your final exam.

1292
01:30:15,090 --> 01:30:18,924
Carin's death cannot make
helping people wrong.

1293
01:30:18,994 --> 01:30:21,622
She saw it coming.

1294
01:30:21,697 --> 01:30:25,360
She knew there was something dangerous
about Larry. I didn't see it.

1295
01:30:25,434 --> 01:30:27,868
Patch,
why are you being like this?

1296
01:30:27,937 --> 01:30:31,338
Because I killed her,
Truman.

1297
01:30:32,474 --> 01:30:35,443
I taught her the medicine
that killed her.

1298
01:30:43,319 --> 01:30:46,254
She'd still be here
if I hadn't met her.

1299
01:31:04,206 --> 01:31:06,140
You can't leave.

1300
01:31:09,278 --> 01:31:14,113
If what you say is true, looks like
I'm defying the laws of possibility.

1301
01:31:17,119 --> 01:31:19,053
What are you doing?

1302
01:31:20,389 --> 01:31:23,222
Oh, I can't leave
until you beat me, is that it?

1303
01:31:23,292 --> 01:31:25,351
Okay. I surrender.
You're number one.

1304
01:31:25,427 --> 01:31:29,227
You're the top student in the class.
You're smarter than me.

1305
01:31:29,298 --> 01:31:32,131
Is that what you want to hear?
Now can I leave?

1306
01:31:36,305 --> 01:31:39,502
You know Mrs. Kennedy
in 212?

1307
01:31:39,575 --> 01:31:41,509
She doesn't eat.

1308
01:31:41,577 --> 01:31:45,445
I visited her room every day
for the last three weeks.

1309
01:31:45,514 --> 01:31:47,448
I can't get her to eat.

1310
01:31:49,351 --> 01:31:52,616
Now, I know everything
there is to know about medicine.

1311
01:31:52,688 --> 01:31:54,622
I've studied relentlessly.

1312
01:31:54,690 --> 01:31:59,457
I guarantee you I can outdo, outdiagnose any
attending and surgeon in this hospital.

1313
01:32:03,632 --> 01:32:05,566
But I can't make her eat.

1314
01:32:11,407 --> 01:32:14,035
You have a gift.

1315
01:32:14,109 --> 01:32:17,476
You have a way with people.

1316
01:32:17,546 --> 01:32:19,980
You know, they like you.

1317
01:32:22,685 --> 01:32:25,620
And if you leave,
I can't learn this way.

1318
01:32:42,338 --> 01:32:44,272
So what now, huh?

1319
01:32:45,874 --> 01:32:48,138
What do You want from me?

1320
01:32:54,316 --> 01:32:56,750
Yeah, I could do it.

1321
01:32:56,819 --> 01:32:59,754
We both know
You wouldn't stop me.

1322
01:33:04,093 --> 01:33:07,028
So answer me, please.

1323
01:33:07,096 --> 01:33:09,530
Tell me what You're doing.

1324
01:33:14,303 --> 01:33:16,737
Okay,
let's look at the logic.

1325
01:33:18,507 --> 01:33:20,532
You create man.

1326
01:33:20,609 --> 01:33:24,477
Man suffers enormous amounts
of pain.

1327
01:33:24,546 --> 01:33:27,913
Man dies.

1328
01:33:27,983 --> 01:33:32,044
Maybe You should have had just
a few more brainstorming sessions...

1329
01:33:32,121 --> 01:33:34,055
prior to Creation.

1330
01:33:35,657 --> 01:33:39,184
You rested
on the seventh day.

1331
01:33:39,261 --> 01:33:42,822
Maybe You should have spent
that day on compassion.

1332
01:33:51,940 --> 01:33:53,874
You know what?

1333
01:33:56,478 --> 01:33:58,412
You're not worth it.

1334
01:35:13,889 --> 01:35:16,221
Do you still want help
with Mrs. Kennedy?

1335
01:35:21,864 --> 01:35:24,264
Hey, Aggie.

1336
01:35:24,333 --> 01:35:26,767
We have a special
surprise for you.

1337
01:35:43,418 --> 01:35:47,252
Surprise!

1338
01:35:49,591 --> 01:35:52,059
Benvenuto, Aggie!

1339
01:35:52,127 --> 01:35:54,561
Aggie! Aggie!

1340
01:35:58,066 --> 01:36:00,034
Grab ahold, Aggie!

1341
01:36:00,102 --> 01:36:01,763
There you go.
Oh!

1342
01:36:01,837 --> 01:36:05,238
-Oh.
-Come on in, Aggie.!

1343
01:36:05,307 --> 01:36:07,241
Y-Yes.

1344
01:36:28,163 --> 01:36:30,757
Pasta angels, Aggie! Pasta angels!

1345
01:36:42,044 --> 01:36:44,308
Patch?

1346
01:36:44,379 --> 01:36:47,837
Hey. I'm supposed
to give you this.

1347
01:37:03,832 --> 01:37:06,797
You turn around and
walk right out of here.

1348
01:37:06,798 --> 01:37:07,698
Why?

1349
01:37:07,799 --> 01:37:10,070
Everything will be delineated
in your letter of dismissal.

1350
01:37:10,138 --> 01:37:12,800
-Why?
-You don't fit in.

1351
01:37:12,874 --> 01:37:14,899
There are standards
and codes.

1352
01:37:14,977 --> 01:37:18,071
You make the patients and everyone
else around you uncomfortable.

1353
01:37:18,146 --> 01:37:20,182
I make you uncomfortable.

1354
01:37:20,183 --> 01:37:22,083
Well, you can make this into
a personal issue if you'd like.

1355
01:37:22,150 --> 01:37:25,313
But the reality is,
you are not cut out to be a physician.

1356
01:37:25,387 --> 01:37:28,322
-And it is my responsibility-
-Responsibility?

1357
01:37:28,390 --> 01:37:32,520
You have one responsibility-to be
a dick-head. How hard can that be?

1358
01:37:32,594 --> 01:37:36,121
All you have to do is make sure your head
is a dick and it's attached to your neck.

1359
01:37:36,198 --> 01:37:38,393
-You leave immediately.
-I wanna see my records.

1360
01:37:38,467 --> 01:37:40,958
They're confidential.

1361
01:37:41,036 --> 01:37:42,901
Only the staff-

1362
01:37:48,644 --> 01:37:50,578
Please,
you have to have permission.

1363
01:37:50,646 --> 01:37:53,809
You can't just go in there
and take your own file!

1364
01:37:53,882 --> 01:37:55,816
Your marks are basically perfect.

1365
01:37:55,884 --> 01:37:59,342
You've gotta be near
the top of the class.

1366
01:37:59,421 --> 01:38:02,857
Look at this.
"Excessive happiness. "

1367
01:38:02,924 --> 01:38:05,825
-Actually says you're excessively happy?
-Mm-hmm.

1368
01:38:05,894 --> 01:38:08,454
And what does that mean?
Isn't that good?

1369
01:38:08,530 --> 01:38:12,626
-I gotta fight this.
-What can we do?

1370
01:38:12,701 --> 01:38:17,400
Dean Walcott seems thoroughly committed
to your not ever becoming a doctor.

1371
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:19,963
Even Dean Anderson
signed this.

1372
01:38:21,743 --> 01:38:23,904
Nah, I'm screwed.

1373
01:38:23,979 --> 01:38:25,947
I like this.

1374
01:38:27,082 --> 01:38:29,016
You need my help.

1375
01:38:29,084 --> 01:38:31,450
I prefer to think
I'm using you.

1376
01:38:32,521 --> 01:38:34,455
-You have one shot.
-Mm-hmm.

1377
01:38:34,523 --> 01:38:36,792
You'd have to appeal to
the state medical board.

1378
01:38:36,793 --> 01:38:37,593
How does that work?

1379
01:38:37,659 --> 01:38:40,528
You claim that a prejudice
and injustice has occurred.

1380
01:38:40,595 --> 01:38:43,326
They'll be worried about a suit.
They'll have to investigate.

1381
01:38:43,327 --> 01:38:44,027
Then what?

1382
01:38:44,099 --> 01:38:46,868
-They'll review your grades, which is good-
-Mm-hmm.

1383
01:38:46,935 --> 01:38:48,869
you're almost
top of the class-

1384
01:38:48,937 --> 01:38:50,871
but mostly your behavior.

1385
01:38:52,474 --> 01:38:54,999
Do you have any idea
what Walcott has on you?

1386
01:38:56,645 --> 01:38:58,579
How'd you get these?

1387
01:38:58,647 --> 01:39:01,480
Don't ask.

1388
01:39:01,550 --> 01:39:05,509
They can't prevent me from graduating
because of a personality clash, can they?

1389
01:39:05,587 --> 01:39:07,851
Hunter, this is a medical institution
you're dealing with.

1390
01:39:07,923 --> 01:39:09,857
They draw their own law.

1391
01:39:09,925 --> 01:39:13,122
You'll have to get their focus
on your high marks and off of this.

1392
01:39:13,195 --> 01:39:15,129
I'm screwed, aren't I?

1393
01:39:16,698 --> 01:39:18,632
You're almost a doctor.

1394
01:39:18,700 --> 01:39:21,567
They're a panel of doctors.

1395
01:39:21,636 --> 01:39:25,367
Just think of them as your peers...
and return these.

1396
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:27,271
Yeah.

1397
01:39:27,342 --> 01:39:30,778
And get a suit.

1398
01:39:55,170 --> 01:39:57,104
Hunter Adams.

1399
01:39:59,541 --> 01:40:02,806
You've been accused of
practicing medicine without a license.

1400
01:40:02,878 --> 01:40:05,176
That's a very
grave charge, son.

1401
01:40:05,247 --> 01:40:09,843
Are you aware that it's unlawful to practice
medicine without a medical license?

1402
01:40:09,918 --> 01:40:11,579
Yes, sir, I am.

1403
01:40:11,653 --> 01:40:15,487
Are you aware that running a medical
clinic without the proper licensing...

1404
01:40:15,557 --> 01:40:17,821
can place both you
and the public...

1405
01:40:17,893 --> 01:40:19,986
in a great deal of danger?

1406
01:40:20,061 --> 01:40:22,029
Is a home a clinic, sir?

1407
01:40:22,097 --> 01:40:25,225
If you are admitting patients
and treating them...

1408
01:40:25,300 --> 01:40:27,768
physical location
is irrelevant.

1409
01:40:27,836 --> 01:40:31,602
Sir, will you define
treatment for me?

1410
01:40:31,673 --> 01:40:36,440
Yes. Treatment would be defined as the care
of a patient seeking medical attention.

1411
01:40:37,646 --> 01:40:40,945
Have you been treating patients,
Mr. Adams?

1412
01:40:41,016 --> 01:40:44,008
I live with several people.
They come and go as they please.

1413
01:40:44,085 --> 01:40:46,019
I offer them
whatever help I can.

1414
01:40:46,087 --> 01:40:48,146
Mr. Adams...

1415
01:40:48,223 --> 01:40:52,319
have you or have you not
been treating patients at your ranch?

1416
01:40:54,362 --> 01:40:57,798
Everyone who comes to the ranch
is a patient, yes.

1417
01:41:00,802 --> 01:41:04,067
And every person who comes
to the ranch is also a doctor.

1418
01:41:06,074 --> 01:41:08,304
I'm sorry?

1419
01:41:08,376 --> 01:41:10,901
Every person who comes
to the ranch is in need...

1420
01:41:10,979 --> 01:41:13,709
of some form of physical
or mental help.

1421
01:41:13,782 --> 01:41:15,716
They're patients.

1422
01:41:15,784 --> 01:41:21,154
But also every person who comes to the ranch
is in charge of taking care of someone else-

1423
01:41:21,222 --> 01:41:23,190
whether it's cooking for them,
cleaning them...

1424
01:41:23,258 --> 01:41:26,159
or even as simple a task
as listening.

1425
01:41:26,227 --> 01:41:28,161
That makes them doctors.

1426
01:41:28,229 --> 01:41:33,531
I use that term broadly, but is not a
doctor someone who helps someone else?

1427
01:41:33,601 --> 01:41:36,631
When did the term "doctor" get
treated with such reverence, as,

1428
01:41:36,632 --> 01:41:38,105
"Right this way, Doctor Smith"...

1429
01:41:38,106 --> 01:41:40,741
or, "Excuse me, Dr. Scholl,
what wonderful footpads"...

1430
01:41:40,809 --> 01:41:44,506
or, "Pardon me, Dr. Patterson,
but your flatulence has no odor"?

1431
01:41:47,248 --> 01:41:50,809
At what point in history
did a doctor become more...

1432
01:41:50,885 --> 01:41:55,117
than a trusted and learned friend
who visited and treated the ill?

1433
01:41:55,190 --> 01:41:58,353
Now, you ask me if
I've been practicing medicine.

1434
01:41:58,426 --> 01:42:01,520
Well, if this means opening
your door to those in need-

1435
01:42:01,596 --> 01:42:03,962
those in pain-

1436
01:42:04,032 --> 01:42:09,436
caring for them, listening to them, applying
a cold cloth until a fever breaks-

1437
01:42:09,504 --> 01:42:11,802
if this is practicing medicine,
if this is treating a patient...

1438
01:42:11,873 --> 01:42:14,433
then I am guilty
as charged, sir.

1439
01:42:14,509 --> 01:42:18,104
Did you consider the ramifications
of your actions?

1440
01:42:18,179 --> 01:42:20,477
What if one of your patients
had died?

1441
01:42:20,548 --> 01:42:22,880
What's wrong
with death, sir?

1442
01:42:22,951 --> 01:42:25,419
What are we so mortally afraid of?

1443
01:42:25,487 --> 01:42:27,652
Why can't we treat death
with a certain amount...

1444
01:42:27,653 --> 01:42:31,451
of humanity and dignity and decency...
and, God forbid, maybe even humor?

1445
01:42:31,526 --> 01:42:33,460
Death is not the enemy,
gentlemen.

1446
01:42:33,528 --> 01:42:37,463
If we're gonna fight a disease, let's fight
one of the most terrible diseases of all-

1447
01:42:37,531 --> 01:42:38,665
indifference.

1448
01:42:38,933 --> 01:42:42,594
Now, I've sat in your schools and heard
people lecture on transference...

1449
01:42:42,670 --> 01:42:44,604
and professional distance.

1450
01:42:44,672 --> 01:42:47,163
Transference
is inevitable, sir.

1451
01:42:47,242 --> 01:42:49,767
Every human being
has an impact on another.

1452
01:42:49,844 --> 01:42:53,302
Why don't we want that in
a patient/doctor relationship?

1453
01:42:53,381 --> 01:42:57,784
That's why I've listened to your
teachings, and I believe they're wrong.

1454
01:42:57,852 --> 01:43:01,754
A doctor's mission should be
not just to prevent death...

1455
01:43:01,823 --> 01:43:03,950
but also to improve
the quality of life.

1456
01:43:04,025 --> 01:43:07,188
That's why you treat a disease,
you win, you lose.

1457
01:43:07,262 --> 01:43:12,495
You treat a person, I guarantee you,
you win, no matter what the outcome.

1458
01:43:14,469 --> 01:43:17,961
Now here today, this room
is full of medical students.

1459
01:43:18,039 --> 01:43:22,738
Don't let them anesthetize you. Don't let
them numb you out to the miracle of life.

1460
01:43:22,811 --> 01:43:26,303
Always live in awe of the
glorious mechanism of the human body.

1461
01:43:26,381 --> 01:43:29,578
Let that be the focus of your studies
and not a quest for grades...

1462
01:43:29,651 --> 01:43:32,586
which'll give you no idea what kind
of doctor you will become.

1463
01:43:32,654 --> 01:43:34,747
Please try and address the board.

1464
01:43:34,823 --> 01:43:37,883
Don't wait till you're on the ward
to get your humanity back.

1465
01:43:37,959 --> 01:43:40,427
Start your interviewing skills.
Start talking to strangers.

1466
01:43:40,495 --> 01:43:43,191
Talk to your friends,
Talk to wrong numbers, everyone.

1467
01:43:43,264 --> 01:43:46,131
-Mr. Adams!
-And cultivate friendships...

1468
01:43:46,201 --> 01:43:49,500
with those amazing people in the back of
the room-nurses that could teach you.

1469
01:43:49,571 --> 01:43:52,699
They've been with people every day.
They wade through blood and shit.

1470
01:43:52,774 --> 01:43:56,733
They have a wealth of knowledge,
and so do the professors you respect-

1471
01:43:56,811 --> 01:43:59,041
the ones who are not dead
from the heart up.

1472
01:43:59,114 --> 01:44:02,682
Share their compassion.
Let that be contagious.

1473
01:44:02,683 --> 01:44:05,485
Mr. Adams, I demand that you turn
and address the board.

1474
01:44:05,553 --> 01:44:08,488
Sir, I want to be a doctor
with all my heart.

1475
01:44:20,969 --> 01:44:24,234
I wanted to become a doctor
so I could serve others...

1476
01:44:24,305 --> 01:44:26,773
and because of that
I've lost everything...

1477
01:44:26,841 --> 01:44:29,537
but I've also
gained everything.

1478
01:44:29,611 --> 01:44:33,775
I've shared the lives of patients
and staff members at the hospital.

1479
01:44:33,848 --> 01:44:36,783
I've laughed with them.
I've cried with them.

1480
01:44:38,153 --> 01:44:40,587
This is what I want to do
with my life.

1481
01:44:43,091 --> 01:44:45,855
And as God is my witness...

1482
01:44:45,927 --> 01:44:48,361
no matter what your decision
today, sir...

1483
01:44:48,429 --> 01:44:53,366
I will still become the best damn doctor
the world has ever seen.

1484
01:44:55,570 --> 01:44:58,630
Now you have the ability
to prevent me from graduating.

1485
01:44:58,706 --> 01:45:02,904
You can keep me from getting
the title and the white coat.

1486
01:45:02,977 --> 01:45:05,241
But you can't control
my spirit, gentlemen.

1487
01:45:05,313 --> 01:45:09,079
You can't keep me from learning.
You can't keep me from studying.

1488
01:45:09,150 --> 01:45:12,278
So you have a choice-you could
have me as a professional colleague...

1489
01:45:12,353 --> 01:45:14,287
passionate...

1490
01:45:14,355 --> 01:45:17,654
or you can have me as an
outspoken outsider, still adamant.

1491
01:45:17,725 --> 01:45:20,785
Either way, I'll probably
still be viewed as a thorn.

1492
01:45:20,862 --> 01:45:23,160
But I promise you one thing.

1493
01:45:23,231 --> 01:45:25,893
I am a thorn
that will not go away.

1494
01:45:28,903 --> 01:45:30,894
Is that all?

1495
01:45:33,208 --> 01:45:35,142
I hope not, sir.

1496
01:45:38,279 --> 01:45:40,474
We will adjourn briefly.

1497
01:46:26,227 --> 01:46:28,161
Thank you.

1498
01:47:00,241 --> 01:47:01,970
Hunter Adams.

1499
01:47:06,748 --> 01:47:10,514
We find your methods
less than appealing.

1500
01:47:11,886 --> 01:47:14,821
Your appearance and your demeanor
do not reflect...

1501
01:47:14,889 --> 01:47:16,823
what we believe
is necessary...

1502
01:47:16,891 --> 01:47:19,985
to earn a patient's trust
and respect.

1503
01:47:21,462 --> 01:47:25,193
You openly accuse us of adhering
to time-honored practices...

1504
01:47:25,266 --> 01:47:30,067
that for years have been the backbone
of the entire medical institution.

1505
01:47:32,607 --> 01:47:34,768
However...

1506
01:47:34,843 --> 01:47:36,970
we find no fault
in your attempts...

1507
01:47:37,045 --> 01:47:40,503
to improve the quality of life
around you.

1508
01:47:41,749 --> 01:47:44,115
We find no fault
in your desire...

1509
01:47:44,185 --> 01:47:47,177
to expand upon existing
medical practices...

1510
01:47:47,255 --> 01:47:49,189
and theories.

1511
01:47:49,257 --> 01:47:52,886
We applaud your love
of the patient.

1512
01:47:52,961 --> 01:47:55,293
Your grades are among
the highest in your class...

1513
01:47:55,363 --> 01:47:58,423
and, therefore, we find
no merit in the decision...

1514
01:47:58,499 --> 01:48:01,400
to block your graduation
from medical school.

1515
01:48:08,376 --> 01:48:13,040
Now, along with your crass
and disdainful behavior...

1516
01:48:13,114 --> 01:48:16,277
you carry with you a flame...

1517
01:48:16,351 --> 01:48:18,285
which one could only hope...

1518
01:48:18,353 --> 01:48:21,379
would spread through
the medical profession like a brushfire.

1519
01:48:22,857 --> 01:48:24,791
And, uh, Dean Walcott...

1520
01:48:24,859 --> 01:48:27,953
in the future,
I think matters like this...

1521
01:48:28,029 --> 01:48:31,795
could best be solved if you yourself
would practice a little...

1522
01:48:31,866 --> 01:48:35,063
"excessive happiness. "

1523
01:49:02,330 --> 01:49:04,491
Well, today you go...

1524
01:49:04,565 --> 01:49:08,194
from being students in a class
to being members of a class-

1525
01:49:08,269 --> 01:49:10,999
a very select class.

1526
01:49:11,072 --> 01:49:14,735
You face the future
with your heads held high...

1527
01:49:14,809 --> 01:49:17,607
because you are now...
doctors.

1528
01:49:27,455 --> 01:49:29,548
Dr. Michael Ames.

1529
01:49:35,129 --> 01:49:38,121
Dr. Doris Ackerman

1530
01:49:41,836 --> 01:49:44,566
Dr. Hunter "Patch" Adams.

1531
01:49:49,077 --> 01:49:51,238
Yea, Patch!

1532
01:49:54,816 --> 01:49:57,910
Well, I'm happy to see
you've finally decided to conform.

1533
01:49:57,986 --> 01:50:00,386
More than you know, sir.
