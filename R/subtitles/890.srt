1
00:01:24,092 --> 00:01:25,270
My friends on the mainland...

2
00:01:25,305 --> 00:01:26,947
...think just because I live in Hawai'i...

3
00:01:26,982 --> 00:01:28,226
...I live in paradise.

4
00:01:29,385 --> 00:01:30,901
Like a permanent vacation.

5
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:33,805
We're all just out here
sipping Mai Tais...

6
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,841
...shaking our hips, catching waves.

7
00:01:36,885 --> 00:01:38,020
Are they insane?

8
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,845
Do they think we are
immune to life?

9
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,728
How can they possibly think
our families are less screwed up...

10
00:01:45,243 --> 00:01:46,962
Our cancers less fatal...

11
00:01:47,321 --> 00:01:49,773
Our heartache less painful.

12
00:01:50,662 --> 00:01:53,687
Hell, I haven't been on
a surfboard in 15 years.

13
00:01:57,638 --> 00:01:59,056
For the last 23 days...

14
00:01:59,091 --> 00:02:01,620
...I've been living in a paradise of IVs...

15
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,282
...and urine bags and
endotracheal tubes.

16
00:02:05,313 --> 00:02:06,489
Paradise.

17
00:02:07,584 --> 00:02:09,458
Paradise can go fuck itself.

18
00:02:17,664 --> 00:02:19,934
This is Elizabeth Thorson King.

19
00:02:20,321 --> 00:02:21,254
My wife.

20
00:02:22,152 --> 00:02:26,398
23 days ago she was launched from
a powerboat during a race and hit her head.

21
00:02:26,974 --> 00:02:28,051
Almost drowned.

22
00:02:29,295 --> 00:02:32,410
When I heard about the accident
and about the coma...

23
00:02:33,022 --> 00:02:34,102
...I wasn't even in town.

24
00:02:34,723 --> 00:02:39,439
I was on Maui on business.
We hadn't spoken in 3 days.

25
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:43,136
In a way, we hadn't
really spoken in months.

26
00:02:47,671 --> 00:02:50,449
If you're doing this to get
my attention, Liz, It's working.

27
00:02:51,236 --> 00:02:52,433
I'm ready now...

28
00:02:52,981 --> 00:02:56,379
I am ready to talk,
I am ready to change...

29
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:59,680
I'm ready to be your
real husband and a real father.

30
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:04,964
Just wake up...
Please, Liz, just wake up.

31
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:11,543
Hi, Noe, what's up?

32
00:03:11,578 --> 00:03:13,701
Matt, Scottie's teacher's on the phone.

33
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:15,061
She says it's urgent.

34
00:03:15,096 --> 00:03:16,538
Okay, Put her on.

35
00:03:20,046 --> 00:03:22,088
We don't think
these photographs are appropriate...

36
00:03:22,089 --> 00:03:24,350
...for Scottie to be sharing
with her classmates.

37
00:03:24,781 --> 00:03:26,697
Some of them
went home quite disturbed...

38
00:03:26,698 --> 00:03:28,422
...and we've got some
angry calls from parents.

39
00:03:28,651 --> 00:03:31,087
Yeah, she's kind of
been going to town...

40
00:03:31,122 --> 00:03:33,513
...on this whole
picture-taking thing, I had no idea-

41
00:03:33,548 --> 00:03:34,710
Mr. King.

42
00:03:34,745 --> 00:03:36,625
We see this every day.

43
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,500
Children acting out at school
when something's wrong at home.

44
00:03:40,501 --> 00:03:44,433
And your family is
facing a devastating crisis.

45
00:03:44,861 --> 00:03:48,629
Have you been engaging Scottie
in really talking about what's going on?

46
00:03:48,664 --> 00:03:49,760
Yes. Yes. Absolutely.

47
00:03:49,795 --> 00:03:52,598
Encouraging her
to express her feelings?

48
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:54,682
- That's crucial.
- I understand.

49
00:03:54,717 --> 00:03:56,380
What's the matter with you?

50
00:03:56,415 --> 00:03:58,504
Showing those pictures of Mom
for your art project?

51
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:01,170
I'm a photographer, Dad,
a real photographer.

52
00:04:01,205 --> 00:04:03,136
No, you're not.
You're overdoing it is what you're doing.

53
00:04:03,171 --> 00:04:04,805
I saw it in a book.

54
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,660
Some famous photographer lady
took pictures of her mom in the hospital...

55
00:04:08,695 --> 00:04:11,303
...While she was dying,
and they're considered art.

56
00:04:11,304 --> 00:04:12,506
That's what I'm doing.

57
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:15,220
First of all, your mother's very sick,
but she's not dying.

58
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,477
And second of all, we don't share
personal stuff with strangers.

59
00:04:18,512 --> 00:04:21,054
What's going on
with Mom is private.

60
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,395
- I'm hungry. Can we get burgers?
- No.

61
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,893
The last time I took care of Scottie
by myself was when she was one 30.

62
00:04:28,182 --> 00:04:29,291
Now she's 10.

63
00:04:29,326 --> 00:04:31,373
And I have no idea
what to do with her.

64
00:04:31,408 --> 00:04:33,646
I want to eat now,
not in an hour.

65
00:04:33,681 --> 00:04:36,673
And with Elizabeth in the hospital,
she's testing me.

66
00:04:37,345 --> 00:04:38,745
I'm the backup parent.

67
00:04:39,328 --> 00:04:40,515
The understudy.

68
00:04:40,967 --> 00:04:44,092
This's Matt King, I'm returning your call.
How can I help you?

69
00:04:44,748 --> 00:04:46,356
It's your daughter, Scottie.

70
00:04:46,357 --> 00:04:48,965
She's been texting some
awful things to My daughter, Lani...

71
00:04:48,966 --> 00:04:50,269
...and I'd like her to stop.

72
00:04:50,304 --> 00:04:51,033
Huh.

73
00:04:51,595 --> 00:04:55,755
Here's the latest one. "We all know
you grew pubes over the summer. "

74
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:59,483
I mean, my daughter can't help that
she's developing a little early for her age.

75
00:04:59,518 --> 00:05:01,174
Do you think that's nice?

76
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:02,862
Oh, That's not like her at all.

77
00:05:03,145 --> 00:05:04,968
She's usually very sweet.

78
00:05:05,003 --> 00:05:08,867
As you may know, her mother isn't well,
maybe this is how she's dealing with it.

79
00:05:08,902 --> 00:05:12,320
I'm very sorry about
your family situation, Mr. King...

80
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:14,803
...But my daughter comes home
from school in tears.

81
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:17,285
Yeah, no, I get it. I'm sorry.

82
00:05:17,369 --> 00:05:19,172
Scottie's the one who should be sorry.

83
00:05:19,566 --> 00:05:21,658
I want her to come over
and apologize...

84
00:05:21,693 --> 00:05:23,952
...and I don't ever want her
to text my daughter again.

85
00:05:24,507 --> 00:05:27,958
If she doesn't apologize,
I'll take it up with the dean.

86
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:30,378
You can't buy
your way out of this.

87
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:34,980
Can you give me an address?

88
00:05:48,876 --> 00:05:50,384
Thank you for coming by.

89
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:52,961
Hi.

90
00:05:55,087 --> 00:05:57,323
I forgot to mention
the time Scottie said...

91
00:05:57,324 --> 00:05:59,513
...she didn't want to be
Lani's partner at the rock wall...

92
00:05:59,548 --> 00:06:02,006
...because she didn't want to
fall into my daughter's butt crack.

93
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:03,688
That doesn't even make sense.

94
00:06:21,568 --> 00:06:22,304
Scottie...

95
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,789
Do you have something
you want to say to Lani?

96
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,487
Sorry.

97
00:06:27,602 --> 00:06:28,810
It's okay.

98
00:06:32,499 --> 00:06:34,132
Great.
Well, nice meeting you both.

99
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:36,471
Lani, you should come over
to our house sometime.

100
00:06:36,506 --> 00:06:37,401
For a swim or a hike or something.

101
00:06:37,436 --> 00:06:39,231
I don't think she's sorry at all.

102
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,746
She's going to keep on
doing it. I can tell.

103
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:42,927
No, she won't.

104
00:06:42,962 --> 00:06:46,403
Look... Scottie,
you're gonna stop, right?

105
00:06:48,043 --> 00:06:49,540
And you're really really sorry, right?

106
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,024
- Oh, and Mr. King?
- Yes?

107
00:07:02,295 --> 00:07:03,394
Good luck with the sale.

108
00:07:04,581 --> 00:07:06,760
They say your decision
will have a major impact...

109
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:08,212
...on Hawaii’s real estate world.

110
00:07:08,247 --> 00:07:10,711
Not to mention the whole
landscape of Kauai.

111
00:07:10,746 --> 00:07:13,355
Hundreds of millions of dollars, yeah?

112
00:07:14,703 --> 00:07:16,385
Yeah, it's a big decision.

113
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,289
My husband's family is from Kauai.

114
00:07:18,762 --> 00:07:22,323
Hanapepe, born and bred.
They hope you don't sell.

115
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:23,736
You don't say.

116
00:07:24,179 --> 00:07:26,163
All the traffic it's gonna make.

117
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,922
As if Liz's coma weren't enough already...

118
00:07:33,957 --> 00:07:36,711
The whole goddamned state
is following my decision...

119
00:07:36,712 --> 00:07:39,978
...on who's gonna buy
25,000 acres on Kauai...

120
00:07:40,013 --> 00:07:42,711
...that my family has
owned since the 1860s.

121
00:07:43,198 --> 00:07:47,815
A lot of my cousins are broke and
the sale will make us all very very rich.

122
00:07:49,977 --> 00:07:52,577
My family meets in 6 days
to approve a buyer.

123
00:07:52,911 --> 00:07:56,065
But ever since my father died,
I'm the sole trustee.

124
00:07:56,224 --> 00:07:58,537
Which means I alone
hold all the cards.

125
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:07,819
My great-great-grandmother was
Princess Margaret Ke'alohilani,

126
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:10,729
One of the last direct descendants
of King Kamehameha.

127
00:08:10,764 --> 00:08:13,092
She was originally
supposed to marry her cousin...

128
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:16,278
...but she fell in love with
Edward King, her haole banker...

129
00:08:16,313 --> 00:08:17,819
...whose parents were missionaries.

130
00:08:18,522 --> 00:08:21,523
Between his land deals
and her huge inheritance...

131
00:08:21,558 --> 00:08:24,738
...generations of their
descendants, all of us...

132
00:08:24,773 --> 00:08:29,756
...have watched the past unfurl millions
into our laps through leases and sales.

133
00:08:31,739 --> 00:08:35,011
Now something called
the Rule Against Perpetuities...

134
00:08:35,046 --> 00:08:36,889
...is forcing us to dissolve the trust.

135
00:08:36,924 --> 00:08:40,994
We're selling our last huge parcel of
virgin Hawaiian land.

136
00:08:44,446 --> 00:08:48,063
Unlike a lot of of my cousins,
I haven’t blown my share of the trust money.

137
00:08:48,147 --> 00:08:49,850
Just like my father before me...

138
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:52,992
I live only on the income
from my law practice.

139
00:08:53,027 --> 00:08:56,324
I don't want my daughters
growing up spoiled and entitled.

140
00:08:56,359 --> 00:08:59,622
Liz always accuses me of being stinginess,
but I agree with my father:

141
00:08:59,792 --> 00:09:02,401
You give your children
enough money to do something...

142
00:09:02,436 --> 00:09:03,771
...but not enough to do nothing.

143
00:09:03,806 --> 00:09:06,840
Matt, your cousins are here.

144
00:09:12,106 --> 00:09:14,309
Not only am I the sole trustee...

145
00:09:14,344 --> 00:09:16,431
...but I specialize in real
estate transactional low.

146
00:09:16,466 --> 00:09:18,498
So a few of the more involved cousins...

147
00:09:18,533 --> 00:09:20,806
...have been meeting with me
regularly to analyze the bids.

148
00:09:20,841 --> 00:09:21,851
- Hey.
- Hey, guys.

149
00:09:21,886 --> 00:09:22,930
Cousin Hal...

150
00:09:22,965 --> 00:09:24,349
Cousin Milo...

151
00:09:24,384 --> 00:09:25,743
Cousin Stan...

152
00:09:25,778 --> 00:09:27,068
Cousin Six...

153
00:09:27,103 --> 00:09:27,939
Cousin Wink...

154
00:09:27,974 --> 00:09:29,462
Cousin Connie.

155
00:09:29,497 --> 00:09:30,419
Okay.

156
00:09:30,454 --> 00:09:33,406
And Cousin Dave, both of whom
oppose the sale entirely.

157
00:09:33,441 --> 00:09:34,636
Good to see you.

158
00:09:34,671 --> 00:09:36,550
Don't be fooled by appearances.

159
00:09:36,585 --> 00:09:40,426
In Hawai'i some of the most powerful people
look like bums and stuntmen.

160
00:09:40,427 --> 00:09:41,659
Alright, so, where are we?

161
00:09:41,694 --> 00:09:43,373
The proposals are virtually the same.

162
00:09:43,408 --> 00:09:46,612
Hotels, shopping centers,
condos and golf courses.

163
00:09:46,844 --> 00:09:48,126
I have some major concerns...

164
00:09:48,161 --> 00:09:50,874
A Chicago group is offering
half a billion dollars...

165
00:09:50,909 --> 00:09:54,726
But we're leaning toward a lower bid
from a guy named Don Holitzer.

166
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,525
He's actually from Kauai...

167
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,315
...made a fortune in Silicon Valley.

168
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:01,897
Old cousin Hugh is pushing us
in that direction, and I say why not?

169
00:10:01,954 --> 00:10:04,951
The money will come from
Hawaii and stay in Hawaii.

170
00:10:18,116 --> 00:10:21,359
Elizabeth's gonna
make it out okay. I know it.

171
00:10:21,532 --> 00:10:23,588
It's not her time yet.

172
00:10:27,157 --> 00:10:31,357
She'll wake up, Scottie and Alexandra
will have their mother back...

173
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,364
...and we'll talk about our marriage.

174
00:10:33,868 --> 00:10:35,659
I know I can make things right.

175
00:10:37,452 --> 00:10:41,814
I'll sell the land and quit my practice
and buy her whatever she wants:

176
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:44,366
A big boat,
a house in France...

177
00:10:44,871 --> 00:10:47,514
We'll take a trip around the world,
just the two of us.

178
00:10:48,074 --> 00:10:49,394
We'll get close again...

179
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:50,714
...like the early days.

180
00:10:52,465 --> 00:10:55,262
I wish I had better news, Matthew.

181
00:10:55,297 --> 00:10:59,606
But Dr. Chun and Dr. Mueller
and I agree that her condition...

182
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,040
...is deteriorating.

183
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:07,317
She has no eye movements,
She has no pupillary responses...

184
00:11:07,977 --> 00:11:11,141
She has no brainstem reflexes whatsoever.

185
00:11:12,785 --> 00:11:14,546
The machines can keep her alive.

186
00:11:14,581 --> 00:11:17,803
But the quality of her life
would be so poor...

187
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,213
Basically the way it is now.

188
00:11:23,145 --> 00:11:27,154
She'll never be the way
she was, Matt. Never.

189
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,747
We know that now.

190
00:11:34,796 --> 00:11:35,639
Look...

191
00:11:37,176 --> 00:11:40,627
I can't tell you how sorry
I am to tell you this.

192
00:11:41,462 --> 00:11:43,483
And you do have your daughters.

193
00:11:44,207 --> 00:11:46,886
There's just nothing
more that we can do.

194
00:11:53,716 --> 00:11:55,923
So if we do go ahead and
take her off the machines -

195
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:57,211
There is no if.

196
00:11:58,286 --> 00:12:01,272
It's When. I have a legal
obligation, You know that.

197
00:12:06,891 --> 00:12:08,468
How long will she last?

198
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,035
That's hard to say.

199
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,955
Could be a few days,
Could be a couple of weeks.

200
00:12:14,095 --> 00:12:18,489
For planning purposes, I think you should
work off the shortest possible scenario.

201
00:12:19,355 --> 00:12:23,005
I know I've got to get the ball rolling
on the organ donations right away.

202
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:26,633
Matt...

203
00:12:28,827 --> 00:12:30,412
Elizabeth has many friends...

204
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:33,254
She has a big life.

205
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,754
If you're gonna let everybody
know to say goodbye which is...

206
00:12:38,789 --> 00:12:42,109
...the typical protocol for these
situations, you start now.

207
00:12:44,414 --> 00:12:45,868
Then when the last day comes...

208
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:48,972
...they feel more ready.

209
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:54,025
As ready as they
can feel for something like this.

210
00:12:57,462 --> 00:12:59,281
I'm so sorry, Matt.

211
00:13:43,396 --> 00:13:44,528
- Hey!
- Hey!

212
00:13:44,563 --> 00:13:45,444
There he is!

213
00:13:45,479 --> 00:13:46,275
How's it going?

214
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,072
What's going on?

215
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,742
Oh, she's been looking a little pale
lately all cooped up in here and...

216
00:13:49,777 --> 00:13:53,507
...I just know she'd be mortified if nobody
helped her out with some lipstick and blush.

217
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:54,811
I know she'll grill me.

218
00:13:55,264 --> 00:13:57,753
And of course Kai's getting her
all caught up on all the latest gossip.

219
00:13:57,788 --> 00:14:00,242
Well, I don't want to
start from scratch later.

220
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:04,049
Oh, and Matt,
on the way here we stopped by...

221
00:14:04,084 --> 00:14:06,171
...and putted some meals
in your fridge, all ready to nuke.

222
00:14:06,206 --> 00:14:07,685
- Thanks.
- Mmhmm.

223
00:14:09,074 --> 00:14:10,922
So what's the latest anyway, Matt?
Any updates?

224
00:14:12,453 --> 00:14:14,478
Just more of the same.
just keeping her kidneys...

225
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,400
...and other vital organs working,

226
00:14:16,435 --> 00:14:18,144
And hoping for the best.

227
00:14:30,985 --> 00:14:32,900
ocean outrigger club

228
00:15:08,348 --> 00:15:10,215
The food at the club is so good.

229
00:15:10,937 --> 00:15:12,616
Yeah, they do a good job here.

230
00:15:15,607 --> 00:15:17,494
Why is it called a jellyfish?

231
00:15:17,495 --> 00:15:19,496
It's not a fish,
it's not jelly.

232
00:15:20,028 --> 00:15:21,284
I have no idea.

233
00:15:21,285 --> 00:15:24,495
You ask good questions, Scottie.
You're getting too smart for me.

234
00:15:25,261 --> 00:15:27,634
I'm gonna ask Mom
when she wakes up.

235
00:15:28,212 --> 00:15:30,169
Do you think she's gonna
know everything she used to?

236
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:32,311
I don't know.

237
00:15:46,396 --> 00:15:47,632
I'll be right back.

238
00:15:49,626 --> 00:15:50,471
Hi, Matt.

239
00:15:50,591 --> 00:15:51,329
Hi, Scottie.

240
00:15:51,446 --> 00:15:52,178
Troy.

241
00:15:53,058 --> 00:15:54,346
So, what's going on?

242
00:15:55,171 --> 00:15:56,746
I mean, how's Elizabeth doing?

243
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:57,890
The same.

244
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,967
Well, you know, I went and
visited her last week and...

245
00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:03,729
I thought she looked pretty good.

246
00:16:03,884 --> 00:16:05,059
Then why'd you ask?

247
00:16:05,378 --> 00:16:08,189
I don't know, I guess I just
wanted to know what the latest is.

248
00:16:08,784 --> 00:16:10,423
And I've been praying for her every day...

249
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,673
...you guys. Really hard. Seriously.

250
00:16:13,965 --> 00:16:17,520
What I meant to say was, when
I was there, I talked to her and she...

251
00:16:18,774 --> 00:16:20,155
...She moved her hand and...

252
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,888
Then I was like... I was encouraged.
I thought that was an encouraging sign.

253
00:16:23,923 --> 00:16:24,829
That's enough.

254
00:16:26,433 --> 00:16:28,384
I really think she heard me.

255
00:16:28,419 --> 00:16:29,462
Look, Troy...

256
00:16:29,631 --> 00:16:31,827
Go to your friends.
There's no hard feelings.

257
00:16:31,862 --> 00:16:33,467
Let's just leave it alone.

258
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,867
I told you, Matt.

259
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,174
The water that day was so choppy.
I told you a hundred times.

260
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,126
What happened to her
could have happened to me.

261
00:16:46,299 --> 00:16:49,143
I mean the ocean was brutal that day.
You can ask anybody.

262
00:16:49,144 --> 00:16:52,264
You weren't supposed to be driving,
She was supposed to be driving.

263
00:16:52,265 --> 00:16:54,448
She wanted me to drive.

264
00:16:54,483 --> 00:16:56,938
She's the one who told me to
pass the other boat before the turn.

265
00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:00,341
You know, it's just your
whole attitude toward me.

266
00:17:00,914 --> 00:17:02,518
I feel terrible about it.

267
00:17:02,784 --> 00:17:05,621
Plus I almost drowned
myself when the boat caps -

268
00:17:08,577 --> 00:17:09,757
Hey.

269
00:17:11,767 --> 00:17:12,613
Scottie!

270
00:17:12,648 --> 00:17:14,636
Hey! Scottie! Scottie!

271
00:17:15,391 --> 00:17:16,124
Hey!

272
00:17:16,971 --> 00:17:17,679
Listen.

273
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,810
Don't pay any attention to that guy.

274
00:17:19,845 --> 00:17:21,097
That guy's a dope.

275
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:22,478
- I hate him.
- Yeah.

276
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:23,690
I know.

277
00:17:24,928 --> 00:17:27,100
Hey. Let's do something crazy.

278
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:29,639
Alright?
let's drive over the airport...

279
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:31,993
We'll hop over to the Big Island
and we'll surprise your sister.

280
00:17:32,028 --> 00:17:32,876
What do you say?

281
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,761
Right now?

282
00:17:33,881 --> 00:17:36,856
Yes, it'll be fun.
She's not expecting us.

283
00:17:36,891 --> 00:17:37,985
And... we can bring her home.

284
00:17:38,218 --> 00:17:40,382
I think she should be
here with us, don't you?

285
00:17:40,383 --> 00:17:41,922
Don't you miss her?
I miss her.

286
00:17:41,957 --> 00:17:45,395
Yeah, I mean I'm out of school.
She should be too!

287
00:17:47,248 --> 00:17:49,627
Okay. Let's go. Com on.

288
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,231
Hey, Troy.

289
00:18:07,009 --> 00:18:10,759
Somehow it feels natural to find a
daughter of mine on a different island.

290
00:18:11,499 --> 00:18:14,194
A family seems
exactly like an archipelago.

291
00:18:14,229 --> 00:18:17,752
All part of the same whole,
but still separate and alone.

292
00:18:18,034 --> 00:18:20,123
And always drifting slowly apart.

293
00:18:58,067 --> 00:18:59,038
That's the wrong door.

294
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:05,021
Go back to sleep, Rylan.

295
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,084
It's ok.

296
00:19:17,249 --> 00:19:18,513
Wake up to your roommate, please.

297
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:21,415
Um... Alex isn't here.

298
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:22,669
Where is she?

299
00:19:22,816 --> 00:19:25,645
I think she's somewhere outside.

300
00:19:25,926 --> 00:19:27,111
Where outside?

301
00:19:38,202 --> 00:19:40,651
Hey, girls! What you guys
think you're doing out here?

302
00:19:41,287 --> 00:19:41,996
Run!

303
00:19:43,706 --> 00:19:45,024
- Fuck!
- Hi, Alex!

304
00:19:45,254 --> 00:19:46,345
It's me, Scottie!

305
00:19:46,503 --> 00:19:49,717
I pay $35,000 a year for this
kind of crap not to happen.

306
00:19:49,752 --> 00:19:50,511
Alex!

307
00:19:51,464 --> 00:19:52,265
Dad?

308
00:19:53,917 --> 00:19:57,087
- My fucking dad is here!
- You need to watch your language.

309
00:19:57,088 --> 00:19:58,634
This is unacceptable behavior.

310
00:20:00,305 --> 00:20:01,425
What's up, Dad?

311
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,583
What's happening?

312
00:20:06,417 --> 00:20:07,842
You need to come home
and see your Mom.

313
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,677
Fuck Mom!

314
00:20:14,557 --> 00:20:16,965
Really? What did I just say
about the language?

315
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,550
You could get expelled for all of this.

316
00:20:21,692 --> 00:20:24,879
What is it that makes the women
in my life wanna destroy themselves?

317
00:20:25,554 --> 00:20:28,208
Elizabeth with her
motorcycles and speedboats...

318
00:20:28,534 --> 00:20:29,378
...and drinking.

319
00:20:30,844 --> 00:20:33,536
Alexandra with her
drugs and older guys.

320
00:20:34,225 --> 00:20:35,282
And Scottie...

321
00:20:35,637 --> 00:20:37,048
...with Elizabeth gone...

322
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:40,090
What kind of a chance
will she have with just me?

323
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,178
Go to bed.

324
00:21:16,581 --> 00:21:17,401
All right.

325
00:21:18,207 --> 00:21:19,040
Here we go.

326
00:21:22,688 --> 00:21:23,779
I don't like eggs.

327
00:21:25,239 --> 00:21:26,881
Why didn't you tell me
before I made them?

328
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:28,520
I thought they were for you.

329
00:21:33,354 --> 00:21:34,246
Good morning.

330
00:21:43,717 --> 00:21:44,502
How're you feeling?

331
00:21:45,383 --> 00:21:46,145
Hangover?

332
00:21:47,149 --> 00:21:49,169
Why am I not surprised?

333
00:21:49,638 --> 00:21:51,315
I thought you were supposed to be
getting your act together.

334
00:21:51,565 --> 00:21:53,917
I have gotten my act together.

335
00:21:53,918 --> 00:21:54,910
I was just drinking.

336
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:59,404
I've been doing really well, actually.
Nobody ever seems to notice that.

337
00:22:00,296 --> 00:22:01,540
My grades are better...

338
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:04,261
How I was in that stupid play
that you guys didn't even bother to see.

339
00:22:04,262 --> 00:22:05,791
Do you even
remember the name of it?

340
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:08,553
That's what I thought.

341
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:13,870
So what? What if I got drunk on the
one night you happened to stop by?

342
00:22:13,905 --> 00:22:15,145
So fucking what?

343
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,498
Hey, hey. Watch your
language around Scottie.

344
00:22:17,574 --> 00:22:18,383
I don't care.

345
00:22:20,328 --> 00:22:21,196
Anyway.

346
00:22:22,268 --> 00:22:23,157
Listen.

347
00:22:23,997 --> 00:22:25,300
it's nice to see you.

348
00:22:25,617 --> 00:22:26,568
Welcome home.

349
00:22:28,304 --> 00:22:29,595
Want some eggs?

350
00:22:43,848 --> 00:22:45,594
I can't believe that.

351
00:22:46,571 --> 00:22:47,352
What?

352
00:22:49,364 --> 00:22:50,570
Oh, my God!

353
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,151
Aha...

354
00:22:52,303 --> 00:22:53,067
Alex?

355
00:22:53,102 --> 00:22:53,874
What did she say?

356
00:22:57,002 --> 00:22:58,238
Can I talk to you for a minute?

357
00:22:59,693 --> 00:23:01,028
The pool's really dirty.

358
00:23:02,262 --> 00:23:03,001
Aha...

359
00:23:04,115 --> 00:23:05,254
Wait... what?

360
00:23:05,527 --> 00:23:06,515
- Hey.
- No.

361
00:23:06,554 --> 00:23:07,739
I really need to talk to you.

362
00:23:07,774 --> 00:23:09,333
She didn't say anything to me.

363
00:23:13,352 --> 00:23:14,059
Aha...

364
00:23:15,762 --> 00:23:16,884
Oh my God, I can't believe...

365
00:23:17,668 --> 00:23:19,725
Hey, yeah... I gotta go.

366
00:23:19,824 --> 00:23:21,071
Okay, I'll see you later.

367
00:23:26,896 --> 00:23:27,873
What day does
the pool guy come?

368
00:23:28,472 --> 00:23:29,484
He comes...

369
00:23:31,214 --> 00:23:32,661
You know, I don't know when he comes.

370
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:33,769
Awesome.

371
00:23:34,084 --> 00:23:35,521
Sid's coming over.

372
00:23:36,001 --> 00:23:36,821
Who's Sid?

373
00:23:36,931 --> 00:23:40,218
A really good friend from Punahou.
We were in school together for years.

374
00:23:40,701 --> 00:23:41,834
Oh. Okay.

375
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,056
He wants to be there for me
with all this shit happening.

376
00:23:46,739 --> 00:23:48,024
Do I know his parents?

377
00:23:48,151 --> 00:23:49,001
No.

378
00:23:50,255 --> 00:23:52,295
He might stay over too.
Is that cool?

379
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,061
Guys, over here.

380
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:56,943
What the fuck? Get out of my
underwear, you freak.

381
00:23:57,178 --> 00:23:58,711
Okay, no, no, no, no!

382
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,967
Back inside put on the swimsuit.

383
00:24:00,976 --> 00:24:01,909
Why?

384
00:24:02,224 --> 00:24:03,035
Now.

385
00:24:06,884 --> 00:24:08,474
A real good job you're doing.

386
00:24:08,932 --> 00:24:10,899
That's part of why
I brought you here.

387
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,350
You have to help me with her.
I don't know what to do with her.

388
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:15,443
Maybe if you spent
more time with her...

389
00:24:15,444 --> 00:24:18,101
...she wouldn't act like
such a complete spaz.

390
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:21,791
Get her out of town -
Go camp on Kauai.

391
00:24:21,826 --> 00:24:24,544
That's what mom used to do with me
whenever I was losing it.

392
00:24:25,433 --> 00:24:26,304
Hey.

393
00:24:26,412 --> 00:24:27,138
Listen.

394
00:24:27,274 --> 00:24:29,152
No, listen, listen to me.

395
00:24:30,282 --> 00:24:31,562
Your mother is not well.

396
00:24:31,696 --> 00:24:32,930
Well, obviously.

397
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:34,104
No.

398
00:24:37,324 --> 00:24:39,161
They just told me
she isn't gonna wake up.

399
00:24:39,543 --> 00:24:41,027
We know for sure now.

400
00:24:43,383 --> 00:24:45,345
The doctors are gonna
stop caring for her.

401
00:24:48,376 --> 00:24:51,324
Your mother wanted it this way.
She has this...

402
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:53,715
She has this will, see...

403
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:56,071
...that says that
we have to do it this way.

404
00:24:56,214 --> 00:24:57,757
We both do.

405
00:25:01,076 --> 00:25:02,146
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

406
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:07,201
That's why I got you.

407
00:25:10,243 --> 00:25:11,886
Honey, we're letting her go.

408
00:25:42,013 --> 00:25:44,621
Why'd you have to tell me
in the goddamned pool?

409
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:45,654
Alex...

410
00:25:45,969 --> 00:25:46,787
Alex!

411
00:25:47,392 --> 00:25:48,275
What?

412
00:25:49,145 --> 00:25:49,854
What do you want?

413
00:26:06,775 --> 00:26:08,412
I just found out yesterday.

414
00:26:15,948 --> 00:26:18,599
We have to go through
this thing together...

415
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,741
...you and Scottie and me.

416
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:25,061
And I have to go around
and tell people what's happening.

417
00:26:26,455 --> 00:26:28,128
Family and a few close friends.

418
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:31,378
Sometimes I'll really
need you to come with me.

419
00:26:31,508 --> 00:26:33,318
Sometimes I need you to watch Scottie.

420
00:26:37,348 --> 00:26:40,664
You want me to go around with you and
tell people that Mom's gonna die?

421
00:26:42,192 --> 00:26:43,340
What's the point of that?

422
00:26:44,183 --> 00:26:47,707
Breaking the news, watching them cry,
dealing with their emotions.

423
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:50,603
How depressing is that
gonna be? Just call them.

424
00:26:50,972 --> 00:26:52,992
Alex, nobody
wants to do any of this.

425
00:26:53,215 --> 00:26:57,094
But we have to tell your Grandpa
and Tutu, and a few friends.

426
00:26:57,409 --> 00:27:00,408
They have the right to know,
They have the right to say goodbye.

427
00:27:01,466 --> 00:27:03,348
I don't wanna talk
about Mom with anyone.

428
00:27:03,535 --> 00:27:07,573
Look, whatever you two fought about
over Christmas, you have to drop it.

429
00:27:07,817 --> 00:27:08,746
Grow up.

430
00:27:09,341 --> 00:27:10,989
You love your mother.
Your mother loves you.

431
00:27:11,265 --> 00:27:12,236
I can't drop it.

432
00:27:12,651 --> 00:27:13,523
You have to.

433
00:27:14,988 --> 00:27:16,611
You really don't have a clue, do you?

434
00:27:22,344 --> 00:27:23,127
Dad...

435
00:27:24,253 --> 00:27:26,761
Dad, mom was cheating on you.

436
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:30,868
That's what we fought about.

437
00:27:32,335 --> 00:27:35,043
When I was over at Christmas,
I caught her with the guy.

438
00:27:36,913 --> 00:27:39,070
It made me sick
to see her near you.

439
00:27:40,727 --> 00:27:43,299
I went back to school
thinking that that was it...

440
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,862
...that I was just done with her.

441
00:27:45,018 --> 00:27:47,610
I was gonna call and
tell you everything, and...

442
00:27:49,033 --> 00:27:51,335
...and then the accident
happened, and...

443
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:55,685
...I was waiting until
she woke up, I guess.

444
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:01,211
You didn't even suspect. Right?

445
00:28:03,788 --> 00:28:04,598
Right?

446
00:28:06,136 --> 00:28:08,734
You disgusted me too.
You're always so busy.

447
00:28:13,217 --> 00:28:15,466
Caught her with a guy?
What does that mean?

448
00:28:16,721 --> 00:28:19,924
I was on my way to swim in
the Black Point pool with Brandy...

449
00:28:20,027 --> 00:28:23,883
...and suddenly I see Mom and
some douche-bag walking into a house.

450
00:28:24,644 --> 00:28:25,997
His house, I guess.

451
00:28:27,317 --> 00:28:29,154
Just some guy?
It could be anybody.

452
00:28:29,259 --> 00:28:31,135
Yeah, he had his hand on her ass.

453
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,941
It was gross.

454
00:28:42,765 --> 00:28:43,482
Then what?

455
00:28:43,517 --> 00:28:45,909
Then nothing.
Then they went into the house.

456
00:28:47,915 --> 00:28:50,265
A few days later I told her
I knew what she was doing.

457
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:52,101
And?

458
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:57,142
And first she acted like she
had no idea what I was talking about.

459
00:28:57,372 --> 00:28:59,243
Like I'm fucking blind.

460
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:04,692
Then she got like super-mad
and yelled and denied it.

461
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:08,877
That is when I decided I didn't want
anything more to do with her.

462
00:29:13,391 --> 00:29:14,273
Who is he?

463
00:29:15,374 --> 00:29:16,898
I don't know. Some guy.

464
00:29:18,062 --> 00:29:19,275
What did he look like?

465
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,443
Dark hair.

466
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,783
Watch your sister.

467
00:30:24,643 --> 00:30:25,536
Hello?

468
00:30:26,177 --> 00:30:27,010
Kai?

469
00:30:27,776 --> 00:30:28,770
Mark?

470
00:30:30,906 --> 00:30:31,733
It's me, Matt!

471
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,381
Hey!

472
00:30:36,953 --> 00:30:37,758
Hello!

473
00:30:37,793 --> 00:30:39,481
Wait... Hello?

474
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:40,536
It's me, it's Matt!

475
00:30:43,032 --> 00:30:43,896
Oh, hey, Matt.

476
00:30:43,931 --> 00:30:45,257
It's a bad time?

477
00:30:45,292 --> 00:30:46,584
No, no, we were just fighting.

478
00:30:46,642 --> 00:30:48,682
Come on in. You want some coffee?
You want something to drink?

479
00:30:49,327 --> 00:30:50,103
No, thanks.

480
00:30:51,025 --> 00:30:53,516
- Fighting about something stupid.
- It is not stupid.

481
00:30:54,746 --> 00:30:58,472
He wants us to throw parties and
have people over, which we do, of course...

482
00:30:58,507 --> 00:31:00,170
...but who winds up doing
all the work? Me.

483
00:31:00,205 --> 00:31:02,060
You don't have to do anything.

484
00:31:02,095 --> 00:31:03,880
- That's the whole point!
- Yes, I do.

485
00:31:03,915 --> 00:31:05,442
It's doesn't have to be work.
You don't have to...

486
00:31:05,443 --> 00:31:07,162
...clean and buy a new outfit.

487
00:31:07,197 --> 00:31:08,830
- Oh, I'm supposed to leave...
- ... and think of the...

488
00:31:08,831 --> 00:31:10,121
...goddamn theme cocktail
for every party.

489
00:31:10,122 --> 00:31:13,600
We can just invite people over
to hang out and drink whatever we have.

490
00:31:14,418 --> 00:31:15,566
Let's talk about it later.

491
00:31:16,015 --> 00:31:17,795
Oh, shit, Matt, is everything okay?

492
00:31:17,915 --> 00:31:19,497
Is there any news?

493
00:31:19,624 --> 00:31:21,915
In fact there is.
I'll tell you about it in a moment.

494
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:22,830
Who is he?

495
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,427
Does she love him?

496
00:31:31,104 --> 00:31:31,901
Who is he?

497
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,591
Matt...

498
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,790
I'm sorry to put you in that position.

499
00:31:35,791 --> 00:31:38,151
But I'm not really the one
who put you there, am I?

500
00:31:38,152 --> 00:31:42,020
I'd like to know who the guy is
that my wife was... seeing.

501
00:31:43,102 --> 00:31:44,007
Matt, you're angry.

502
00:31:44,008 --> 00:31:45,795
You have very keen
powers of observation.

503
00:31:45,826 --> 00:31:47,006
Wow. Okay, You know what I think?

504
00:31:47,007 --> 00:31:49,472
We should just talk about this later.
I think maybe you need to cool it.

505
00:31:50,777 --> 00:31:53,272
Is it Troy?
That fucking Neanderthal?

506
00:31:56,468 --> 00:31:57,515
You don't know him.

507
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:59,817
Mark, don't you even.
Shame on you.

508
00:32:00,037 --> 00:32:01,218
You're supposed to be her friend.

509
00:32:01,433 --> 00:32:03,819
Well, guess what?
I'm Matt's friend too.

510
00:32:03,977 --> 00:32:06,764
Okay? And this is a unique
and dramatic situation...

511
00:32:07,034 --> 00:32:08,289
...and I'd wanna know.

512
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:11,018
Yeah, But don't betray her
when she can't even defend herself.

513
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,338
Matt...

514
00:32:15,804 --> 00:32:18,020
Look, you might not be able
to hear this right now...

515
00:32:19,175 --> 00:32:20,728
...but it's not her fault.

516
00:32:22,128 --> 00:32:26,702
Your marriage was not... just...
She was lonely.

517
00:32:26,737 --> 00:32:29,206
So you're going to talk to me
in clichés about women?

518
00:32:29,207 --> 00:32:31,225
Nothing is ever a woman's fault.

519
00:32:31,226 --> 00:32:33,264
Was it still going on
when she had the accident?

520
00:32:35,953 --> 00:32:37,249
But I stayed out of it.

521
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:42,489
Anytime Kai would bring it up, I walked away.

522
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:44,037
And you What?

523
00:32:44,038 --> 00:32:48,363
You probably egged her on.
Add some drama to your life without any actual risk.

524
00:32:48,364 --> 00:32:51,743
Whom do you think you are protecting Kai?
She doesn't need your protection...

525
00:32:51,744 --> 00:32:55,057
it's over. she's gonna die.

526
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:58,022
- Don't say that.
- It's true, I was gonna tell you yesterday.

527
00:32:58,023 --> 00:33:01,557
She is never gonna wake up.
You hear me? Do you understand what I'm saying?

528
00:33:01,558 --> 00:33:02,674
She is gone!

529
00:33:02,675 --> 00:33:04,252
We are pulling the plug.

530
00:33:04,253 --> 00:33:07,438
You were putting lipstick on a corpse!

531
00:33:11,873 --> 00:33:13,890
Come on, Matt.

532
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:16,415
That's a little intense.

533
00:33:38,674 --> 00:33:41,853
Does she love him?

534
00:33:41,854 --> 00:33:46,025
How can you ask about him when she’s
going to die? who cares?

535
00:33:46,026 --> 00:33:47,479
Yes, she loves him...

536
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:52,223
...loved him, whatever. She was crazy about him.
She was going to...

537
00:33:52,224 --> 00:33:55,104
...She was going to ask you for a divorce.

538
00:34:07,819 --> 00:34:11,761
You still haven't told me who he is.

539
00:34:11,762 --> 00:34:14,022
I guess it doesn’t matter.

540
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:25,258
Matt?

541
00:34:25,259 --> 00:34:27,551
Matt!

542
00:34:28,552 --> 00:34:30,555
Brian Speer.

543
00:34:30,556 --> 00:34:32,650
His name is Brian Speer.

544
00:34:32,651 --> 00:34:34,966
Two e’s.

545
00:35:22,766 --> 00:35:25,136
Hi, Daddy.

546
00:35:25,287 --> 00:35:27,449
Hello, Sid.

547
00:35:31,467 --> 00:35:35,654
What's up bro?

548
00:35:35,655 --> 00:35:38,161
Don’t ever do that to me again.

549
00:35:38,162 --> 00:35:40,645
Get ready, We’re going to see your
Grandparents...

550
00:35:40,646 --> 00:35:42,582
Auntie Esther will come over to watch
you.

551
00:35:42,583 --> 00:35:44,336
Dad, Sid's coming with us, okay?

552
00:35:44,337 --> 00:35:48,723
Yeah, listen Sid, what’s going on this weekend, is
really a family matter. You understand.

553
00:35:48,724 --> 00:35:53,644
Sid’s not going to be interested in meeting your grandparents.
He's gonna be bored stiff.

554
00:35:53,645 --> 00:35:55,958
Dad, I told you that he was going to be with me.

555
00:35:55,959 --> 00:36:01,356
I’ll be a lot more civil with him
around.

556
00:36:01,357 --> 00:36:03,931
What can I say?

557
00:36:11,945 --> 00:36:14,571
This is like reading Korean.

558
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:18,609
Scott, if you want, I can walk you through it.

559
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:22,441
Jibber-jabber.

560
00:36:22,442 --> 00:36:24,945
It’s an advanced directive...

561
00:36:24,946 --> 00:36:27,773
It's basically her instructions on what
procedures she wants or...

562
00:36:27,774 --> 00:36:30,382
I know goddamn well what it says.

563
00:36:30,383 --> 00:36:33,771
she doesn’t want us sit around
watching her spoiling like milk.

564
00:36:33,961 --> 00:36:39,649
if there is nothing of doctors can do,
she’d just get on with it.

565
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:43,304
Elizabeth had the good sense
to write this thing here.

566
00:36:43,305 --> 00:36:45,532
She always was a thoughtful
girl.

567
00:36:45,533 --> 00:36:47,937
A Strong girl.

568
00:36:47,938 --> 00:36:50,164
A hell of a lot stronger than her brother.

569
00:36:50,165 --> 00:36:52,534
Barry whines his way through life.

570
00:36:52,535 --> 00:36:54,749
Might even be a homosexual, for all I know.

571
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:55,942
Scott, I do not think.

572
00:36:55,943 --> 00:36:57,999
And she’s stronger than you, Matt.

573
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,737
She lived more in a year
than you did in a decade,

574
00:37:00,738 --> 00:37:03,881
sitting in your office, hoarding all your cash.

575
00:37:03,882 --> 00:37:06,554
All that money you refuse to use...

576
00:37:06,555 --> 00:37:08,162
what the hell good is it?

577
00:37:08,163 --> 00:37:12,861
And now you and your family
get ready cashing in your chips, what the hell for?

578
00:37:12,862 --> 00:37:15,746
Maybe if you’d let my baby have
her own boat and bought her...

579
00:37:15,747 --> 00:37:17,503
some safe equipment or...

580
00:37:17,504 --> 00:37:20,998
let her go on those shopping sprees women like.

581
00:37:20,999 --> 00:37:24,137
maybe she wouldn’t have gone in
for those shrill sports.

582
00:37:24,138 --> 00:37:28,548
Maybe if you’d provided more thrills at home.

583
00:37:28,549 --> 00:37:31,588
And you, Alexandra...

584
00:37:31,589 --> 00:37:33,008
Putting your poor mother through hell...

585
00:37:33,009 --> 00:37:36,827
when all she was trying to do was instill
some sense and drive in you.

586
00:37:36,829 --> 00:37:38,371
Shame on you.

587
00:37:38,406 --> 00:37:39,914
Shame on you!

588
00:37:39,915 --> 00:37:43,569
You should try to be more like her.

589
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:48,618
She’s a good girl.
She’s a...

590
00:37:48,619 --> 00:37:50,532
Good girl.

591
00:38:36,521 --> 00:38:38,289
Hi, Alice

592
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:40,018
It’s me, Matt.

593
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:41,903
It's good to see you.

594
00:38:41,904 --> 00:38:43,901
Good to see you too.

595
00:38:43,902 --> 00:38:45,023
Hi, Tutu.

596
00:38:45,024 --> 00:38:46,966
That’s Alexandra.

597
00:38:46,967 --> 00:38:48,940
She’s your granddaughter.

598
00:38:48,941 --> 00:38:50,656
And this is your son-in-law Matt.

599
00:38:50,657 --> 00:38:53,121
This is your family.

600
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:56,745
Well, except this kid.
I don’t know who the hell he is.

601
00:38:56,746 --> 00:38:57,638
Who are you?

602
00:38:57,639 --> 00:38:58,775
What are you doing here?

603
00:38:58,776 --> 00:38:59,863
He's my friend.

604
00:38:59,864 --> 00:39:01,981
Good afternoon.

605
00:39:06,324 --> 00:39:08,121
Alice...

606
00:39:08,122 --> 00:39:12,740
Alice, we’re going to go to Queen’s
Hospital this afternoon and see Elizabeth.

607
00:39:12,741 --> 00:39:13,845
We are?

608
00:39:13,846 --> 00:39:14,789
Yes.

609
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:16,077
She needs us,

610
00:39:16,078 --> 00:39:19,936
just like when she was a little girl.
We need to see her in the hospital.

611
00:39:19,937 --> 00:39:24,010
So think about what she might want in her room.

612
00:39:24,011 --> 00:39:27,218
...We'll take it to her and put it next to
her bed.

613
00:39:27,219 --> 00:39:30,137
Queen Elizabeth?

614
00:39:30,138 --> 00:39:32,953
That's wonderful!

615
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:37,053
I have to put on a nice dress.

616
00:39:37,054 --> 00:39:39,761
Is she serious?

617
00:39:39,762 --> 00:39:41,717
Shut up, kid.

618
00:39:41,718 --> 00:39:45,499
I have never met Queen before.

619
00:39:48,197 --> 00:39:49,738
I’m sorry, man.

620
00:39:49,739 --> 00:39:52,754
I was just laughing.
It’s funny I mean.

621
00:39:52,755 --> 00:39:54,993
I think she knows she’s being funny.

622
00:39:54,994 --> 00:40:00,621
I’m going to hit you.

623
00:40:00,622 --> 00:40:02,355
That was unreal.

624
00:40:02,356 --> 00:40:03,638
I mean...

625
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:08,778
how often do old people just haul off
and fucking cold-cock you in like that?

626
00:40:08,779 --> 00:40:11,246
He’s hit me a couple times over the years.

627
00:40:11,247 --> 00:40:13,464
And watch your tongue.

628
00:40:13,465 --> 00:40:15,493
can I see it?

629
00:40:15,494 --> 00:40:18,828
Holly shit!

630
00:40:18,829 --> 00:40:21,371
- Ow!
- could you two just cool it...

631
00:40:21,372 --> 00:40:24,533
when you around me?
stop... touching each other.

632
00:40:24,534 --> 00:40:26,816
Whoa man!

633
00:40:26,817 --> 00:40:31,145
Maybe that’s why your wife cheated on
you, if you are so against touching.

634
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:38,046
You little fuck. Do you get hit a lot?

635
00:40:38,047 --> 00:40:38,970
I do not know.

636
00:40:38,971 --> 00:40:43,121
I’ve had my share.

637
00:40:43,122 --> 00:40:45,397
Your friend is completely retarded.
You know that?

638
00:40:45,398 --> 00:40:48,577
Hey man, my little brother’s retarded.

639
00:40:48,578 --> 00:40:53,771
Don’t use that word in a derogatory fashion.

640
00:40:53,772 --> 00:40:56,196
Oh.

641
00:40:56,197 --> 00:41:01,138
- Psych! I don’t have a retarded brother!
- Sid, You suck.

642
00:41:04,486 --> 00:41:05,755
Speaking of retarded...

643
00:41:05,756 --> 00:41:09,694
...do you ever wish that retarded
people or old people could just hurry up?

644
00:41:09,695 --> 00:41:11,317
like sometimes...

645
00:41:11,318 --> 00:41:15,911
I'm waiting for them to cross the
street, and I’m like, come on already!

646
00:41:15,912 --> 00:41:18,467
But then I feel bad.

647
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,417
Dad?

648
00:41:29,418 --> 00:41:31,157
What?

649
00:41:31,158 --> 00:41:36,786
Don’t forget that I know where he lives.

650
00:41:36,787 --> 00:41:42,355
Get in the front seat

651
00:41:42,356 --> 00:41:47,315
Do you know anything about him? Like
what he does or if he’s married or anything else?

652
00:41:47,316 --> 00:41:50,658
just his name. Brian Speer.

653
00:41:50,659 --> 00:41:52,794
Why didn't you ask Kai and Mark?

654
00:41:52,795 --> 00:41:54,085
I just didn’t.

655
00:41:54,086 --> 00:41:55,248
Why not?

656
00:41:55,249 --> 00:41:57,398
I didn’t want to get into it.

657
00:41:57,399 --> 00:41:59,798
We’ll Google him later.

658
00:41:59,799 --> 00:42:03,888
Okay...

659
00:42:03,889 --> 00:42:05,634
That's it, That’s it, That’s on
stop right there.

660
00:42:05,635 --> 00:42:08,077
- right there?
- yeah, yeah.

661
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:14,734
There?

662
00:42:14,735 --> 00:42:16,083
He lives there?

663
00:42:16,084 --> 00:42:21,540
Well, I can’t say for sure he lives
there. That’s just where I saw them.

664
00:42:21,541 --> 00:42:23,446
Should I go ring the bell?

665
00:42:23,447 --> 00:42:29,204
No, this is stupid... it's just
stalking, or something that, okay, it's...

666
00:42:29,205 --> 00:42:32,630
We came, we saw, that’s enough enough.
Let's go.

667
00:42:32,631 --> 00:42:35,566
It’s not like we’re stalking him
exactly.

668
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:49,634
What would you do if you saw him, anyway?

669
00:42:49,635 --> 00:42:54,177
Talk to him or punch him or
what?

670
00:42:54,178 --> 00:42:56,577
I guess I just want to see him.

671
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,977
Dad, dad. Stop,
stop, stop, stop!

672
00:43:19,978 --> 00:43:20,595
What?

673
00:43:20,596 --> 00:43:22,836
Go back, go back!

674
00:43:22,837 --> 00:43:23,508
What?

675
00:43:23,509 --> 00:43:25,660
Just go back.

676
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:32,701
- Look, look!
- What?

677
00:43:32,702 --> 00:43:37,423
Look! There he is!

Thank you.

Girls, let me go in for just a quick moment
alone first.

692
00:45:21,717 --> 00:45:23,463
I’ll be right out.

693
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:39,874
You were going to ask me for a divorce?
So you could be with some fucking fuckhead Brian Speer?

694
00:45:39,875 --> 00:45:43,111
Are you kidding me?

695
00:45:43,112 --> 00:45:45,197
Who are you?

696
00:45:45,198 --> 00:45:49,436
the only thing I know for sure is that you’re a
goddamned liar.

697
00:45:51,912 --> 00:45:55,264
So what do you have to say for yourself?

698
00:45:55,265 --> 00:45:57,306
Go ahead, make a little joke and...

699
00:45:57,307 --> 00:46:01,025
...tell me that I’ve got it all wrong.

700
00:46:01,026 --> 00:46:03,534
Tell me again I’m too out of touch with
my feelings

701
00:46:03,535 --> 00:46:05,530
and I need to go to therapy.

702
00:46:07,048 --> 00:46:10,992
Isn’t the idea of marriage to make your
partner’s way in life a little easier?

703
00:46:10,993 --> 00:46:13,563
For me it was always harder...

704
00:46:13,564 --> 00:46:17,509
with you and you’re still making it harder.

705
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:21,040
Lying there on a ventilator and
fucking up my life.

706
00:46:21,041 --> 00:46:25,604
You're relentless.

707
00:46:25,605 --> 00:46:28,826
You know what? I was going to ask you
for a divorce some day.

708
00:46:38,573 --> 00:46:40,463
Daddy’s little girl.

709
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,955
I’m bringing your daughters in now.

710
00:46:46,956 --> 00:46:48,919
Alex is home from school

711
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:51,730
Try to be nice, okay?

712
00:47:07,714 --> 00:47:08,490
Okay?

713
00:47:08,491 --> 00:47:11,407
Hi, Mom! Look who’s here.

714
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:29,328
Say something Alex. Tell her how
you were drunk the other night.

715
00:47:29,329 --> 00:47:31,382
Tell her maybe you’re an alcoholic.

716
00:47:31,383 --> 00:47:35,238
Girls, be serious.

717
00:47:35,239 --> 00:47:38,242
Hi, Mom.

718
00:47:38,243 --> 00:47:41,982
Sorry for being bad.

719
00:47:41,983 --> 00:47:46,744
sorry for wasting your money on expensive private schools.

720
00:47:46,745 --> 00:47:50,337
Money you could have used on facials
and massages and...

721
00:47:50,338 --> 00:47:51,520
...sports equipment.

722
00:47:51,521 --> 00:47:54,225
- Sorry for everything.
- Okay.

723
00:47:54,226 --> 00:47:57,213
Sorry we weren’t good enough for you...
especially Dad.

724
00:47:57,214 --> 00:47:58,811
Stop it. That’s out of line.

725
00:47:58,812 --> 00:48:00,234
Or what? You going to ground me?

726
00:48:00,235 --> 00:48:03,390
Or ship me off to another boarding school?
You going to give me a time out?

727
00:48:03,391 --> 00:48:06,019
Goddammit!

728
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:07,811
You got served!

729
00:48:07,812 --> 00:48:08,938
Scottie, out in the hall.

730
00:48:08,939 --> 00:48:11,507
- She’s the one out of line.
- Go find Sid.

731
00:48:11,508 --> 00:48:13,852
- He’s smoking. I shouldn’t be around
second-hand smoke.

732
00:48:13,853 --> 00:48:16,020
Go! Now! Now! Now!

733
00:48:18,166 --> 00:48:19,442
Did you just spank me?

734
00:48:19,443 --> 00:48:22,001
You have no right to talk to your
mother that way. She’s going to die in a few days.

735
00:48:22,002 --> 00:48:25,061
- What if those were your last words?
- I have every right to speak her that way.

736
00:48:25,062 --> 00:48:27,599
I’m mad at her. How can you be so
forgiving?

737
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:32,702
I’ll be angry later. Right now let’s just think about the good parts.
and don’t say that stuff in front of your sister.

738
00:48:32,703 --> 00:48:38,668
Don’t spoil her for Scottie.

739
00:48:38,669 --> 00:48:40,618
Say something different.

740
00:48:48,621 --> 00:48:52,968
Look, Mom, I know we fought a lot...

741
00:48:52,969 --> 00:48:56,324
I just I always wanted to be like you.

742
00:48:56,325 --> 00:49:00,744
I am like you. I’m exactly like you.

743
00:49:03,265 --> 00:49:04,879
You are like her.

744
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,487
mostly in good ways.

745
00:49:06,488 --> 00:49:11,134
Maybe some bad ways.
Remains to be seen.

746
00:49:14,089 --> 00:49:16,154
Yeah.

747
00:49:23,245 --> 00:49:25,217
Dad, this is Reina.

748
00:49:25,218 --> 00:49:29,098
Reina, this’s my sister and Sid, and
that’s my mom on the bed.

749
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:30,246
Hi everybody.

750
00:49:30,247 --> 00:49:31,406
Hello.

751
00:49:31,407 --> 00:49:33,183
Hi.

752
00:49:38,606 --> 00:49:41,104
So this is your mother?

753
00:49:41,105 --> 00:49:43,283
I guess it’s true.

754
00:49:43,284 --> 00:49:45,226
Should I shake her hand?

755
00:49:45,227 --> 00:49:46,726
If you want.

756
00:49:46,727 --> 00:49:48,196
No, thanks.

757
00:49:48,197 --> 00:49:52,241
So, Reina, I understand your grandmother’s
not feeling well.

758
00:49:52,242 --> 00:49:56,402
Yeah. It’s pretty bad. She got her stomach
operated on

759
00:49:56,403 --> 00:49:58,905
and then got some stupid
infection or something.

760
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:01,417
It’s pretty gross.

761
00:50:01,418 --> 00:50:04,155
Well, Reina, thank you for stopping by...

762
00:50:04,156 --> 00:50:07,126
...Scottie, let me give you some money, and
you two can go get ice cream...

763
00:50:07,127 --> 00:50:09,847
Too many carbs.

764
00:50:09,848 --> 00:50:11,854
Too many carbs?

765
00:50:11,855 --> 00:50:16,011
Well, you could go to the cafeteria
and get some lettuce.

766
00:50:16,012 --> 00:50:20,639
That’s okay. I’m done.
you aren’t a liar after all.

767
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,870
Don't you want to hang out?

768
00:50:21,871 --> 00:50:26,163
No, I should go. I’ll see you at the
club. Hope your mom gets better.

769
00:50:26,164 --> 00:50:30,674
Bye everybody.

770
00:50:30,675 --> 00:50:34,121
Scottie, what’d she mean by
You aren’t a liar after all?

771
00:50:34,122 --> 00:50:35,875
What did she think you were lying about?

772
00:50:35,876 --> 00:50:38,163
she didn’t believe Mom was sleeping.

773
00:50:38,164 --> 00:50:40,845
So you had to prove to that twat that
Mom’s in a coma?

774
00:50:40,846 --> 00:50:44,258
What the fuck is in
your skull, a bunch of stupid pills?

775
00:50:44,259 --> 00:50:46,299
shut up, you motherless whore!

776
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:48,359
Whoa, whoa, easy there, half-pipe.

777
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:51,411
Where’d you learn how to talk like that?

778
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:04,295
Incoming Call
GOLD Coast Real Estate

779
00:51:08,813 --> 00:51:11,812
- No, no, no.
- Hello?

780
00:51:11,813 --> 00:51:13,704
No, this is the right number.

781
00:51:13,705 --> 00:51:16,850
No, I'm his assistant Sharon.
How may I help you?

782
00:51:16,851 --> 00:51:18,860
Who is it?

783
00:51:18,861 --> 00:51:22,372
Aha.

784
00:51:22,373 --> 00:51:26,138
Oh, all right, all right. So one or the other.

785
00:51:26,139 --> 00:51:30,146
Okay, I'll tell him. Mahalo!

786
00:51:30,147 --> 00:51:32,070
That was Bonnie Tanaka, a realtor.

787
00:51:32,071 --> 00:51:35,546
She says that Mr. Speer is going to be
on Kauai for the next week but...

788
00:51:35,547 --> 00:51:37,437
...she’d be happy to show you the house or...

789
00:51:37,438 --> 00:51:40,303
...you can stop by the open house on Sunday.

790
00:52:11,496 --> 00:52:13,726
Hi Mr. King.

791
00:52:13,727 --> 00:52:14,753
Hello, Buzz.

792
00:52:14,754 --> 00:52:17,888
Sorry about Mrs. King. hope she gets better real soon.

793
00:52:17,889 --> 00:52:20,220
Thanks.

794
00:52:20,221 --> 00:52:23,444
It really blows.

795
00:52:23,445 --> 00:52:27,417
I know.

796
00:52:27,418 --> 00:52:31,418
You’ve all ask questions about of Elizabeth.
and I’ve given vague answers.

797
00:52:31,419 --> 00:52:36,602
But I ask you all here today
to tell you that...

798
00:52:36,603 --> 00:52:39,846
...her coma is permanent.

799
00:52:39,847 --> 00:52:43,125
She’s not going to make it.

800
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:45,322
So, this week...

801
00:52:45,323 --> 00:52:47,955
...Tomorrow, in fact...

802
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:52,934
as for her her wishes, we’re going to unhook
her from life-support.

803
00:52:56,766 --> 00:52:58,410
You all know Elizabeth...

804
00:52:58,411 --> 00:53:00,904
...she is doing things on her own.

805
00:53:05,676 --> 00:53:07,381
I wanted to tell you all in person...

806
00:53:07,382 --> 00:53:13,890
...Because You’re all our dear friends
our best friends.

807
00:53:13,951 --> 00:53:19,906
The girls and I are so much appreciate
everything you’ve done for us in the last few weeks...

808
00:53:19,907 --> 00:53:24,054
bringing food, calling...

809
00:53:24,055 --> 00:53:25,452
Can we go see her?

810
00:53:25,453 --> 00:53:29,982
Yes, for God’s sake, yes. That’s the
whole point.

811
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:32,361
Go see her as soon as possible.
That’s what I wanted to tell you.

812
00:53:32,362 --> 00:53:33,902
All of you.

813
00:53:33,903 --> 00:53:38,871
It should be now, not after.

814
00:53:38,872 --> 00:53:42,631
Everyone who loves her deserves a
chance to say goodbye.

815
00:54:13,076 --> 00:54:15,251
You’ve lost your mind.

816
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:18,706
You mean him? Tell him to come say goodbye?

817
00:54:18,707 --> 00:54:22,156
I’ll only be gone a day or so. I’ll leave in the
morning, and be back tomorrow night.

818
00:54:22,157 --> 00:54:24,295
If it takes another day,

819
00:54:24,296 --> 00:54:27,706
fine... I'll give it two days
tops. If I don’t find him, at least I tried.

820
00:54:27,741 --> 00:54:28,534
Just Drop it, Dad.

821
00:54:28,535 --> 00:54:33,533
You’ve got way bigger
fish to fry than confronting fucking Brian Speer.

822
00:54:33,534 --> 00:54:35,905
Are you recording this?

823
00:54:35,906 --> 00:54:37,716
I’m summarizing a deposition.

824
00:54:37,717 --> 00:54:40,305
How can you work in a time like this?

825
00:54:40,306 --> 00:54:41,986
How can you go to a movie?

826
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:43,750
To get Scottie out of the house.

827
00:54:43,751 --> 00:54:47,841
And you’re going to tell him to come back
and see Mom.

828
00:54:49,390 --> 00:54:53,678
I think... I just think she would want
him to know.

829
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:59,025
Just call his office and say it's an
emergency.

830
00:54:59,026 --> 00:55:01,224
On the phone he can escape.

831
00:55:01,225 --> 00:55:08,951
In person he got nowhere to go.
I want to see his face.

832
00:55:08,952 --> 00:55:11,443
Then I want to go too.

833
00:55:11,444 --> 00:55:13,323
No, you are gonna stay here with Scottie.

834
00:55:13,324 --> 00:55:16,008
Fuck that. Let’s all get out of town.

835
00:55:39,851 --> 00:55:43,676
Yo, Matt King!

836
00:55:43,677 --> 00:55:45,598
- Hey, Ralph!
- Hey!

837
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:47,723
Yeah, how is it?

838
00:55:47,724 --> 00:55:50,112
- Glad to see you.
- Kids, this is cousin Ralph

839
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:51,244
- Oh, yeah, Hi!
- Good to see you!

840
00:55:51,245 --> 00:55:52,070
Glad to see you.

841
00:55:52,071 --> 00:55:53,184
Well, what you guys doing here?

842
00:55:53,185 --> 00:55:54,758
Just came over for a day or two.

843
00:55:54,759 --> 00:55:55,950
Yeah, I just got back from Kahului. A
little business over there.

844
00:55:55,951 --> 00:55:57,428
- Yes?
- Business is over there.

845
00:55:57,429 --> 00:55:58,370
- Ahan.
- yeah.

846
00:55:58,371 --> 00:55:59,880
So you here to talk to some
of the cousins?

847
00:55:59,881 --> 00:56:01,525
Make sure everybody’s
happy with your choice?

848
00:56:01,526 --> 00:56:03,039
Pay your respects to Cousin Hugh?

849
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,820
No, no, nothing like that. Just
a little holoholo. Get the kids out of town.

850
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:07,476
But it is Holitzer, right?

851
00:56:07,477 --> 00:56:08,921
We all know it’s Holitzer.

852
00:56:08,922 --> 00:56:12,328
Cousin Hugh wants him, they go way back.
I got my misgivings, somehow.

853
00:56:12,329 --> 00:56:15,759
There’s an argument to be made for
maxing it out. We only do this once in a lifetime.

854
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,351
yeah, no, I want to work with
you guys, Ralph, I really do.

855
00:56:18,352 --> 00:56:21,832
Whatever the majority decides after
the Poll, I’ll go along with it.

856
00:56:21,833 --> 00:56:23,700
Let’s just get it over with.

857
00:56:23,701 --> 00:56:24,818
- All right.
- okay.

858
00:56:24,819 --> 00:56:26,694
How’s Elizabeth doing? She going to be
okay?

859
00:56:26,695 --> 00:56:28,130
The same.

860
00:56:28,131 --> 00:56:30,517
Well, she’s a tough gal. She’ll be
okay, yeah?

861
00:56:30,518 --> 00:56:31,289
Yeah.

862
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:32,997
Say, where you guys going, Hanalei?

863
00:56:32,998 --> 00:56:34,284
Princeville.

864
00:56:34,285 --> 00:56:35,791
Come on. I’ll give you a ride.

865
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:36,769
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

866
00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:38,434
Come on, kids.

867
00:56:38,435 --> 00:56:40,977
cousin Ralph give us a ride.

868
00:56:57,795 --> 00:57:00,295
- Hey, Ralph!
- yeah.

869
00:57:00,296 --> 00:57:02,816
Turn off over here. Let’s go see the
land.

870
00:57:02,817 --> 00:57:04,867
Take a last look, huh?

871
00:57:04,868 --> 00:57:05,957
You got time?

872
00:57:05,958 --> 00:57:08,247
I got nothing but time.

873
00:57:29,174 --> 00:57:31,617
I think this is where a golf course is
going to be.

874
00:57:31,618 --> 00:57:33,930
They want the golf course to rival
Pebble Beach.

875
00:57:33,931 --> 00:57:36,445
you know, bring in the big boys.

876
00:58:03,395 --> 00:58:06,060
Scotty, come on sweetie.

877
00:58:23,779 --> 00:58:26,006
Watch out, Scotty, watch out.

878
00:58:36,507 --> 00:58:38,151
are you shitting me?

879
00:58:38,152 --> 00:58:40,133
You guys own all this land?

880
00:58:40,134 --> 00:58:43,462
Not personally. It belongs to a trust.

881
00:58:43,463 --> 00:58:45,451
But yeah, it’s ours for a few more days.

882
00:58:45,452 --> 00:58:47,789
Big resort there on that point.

883
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:49,219
Commercial area over there...

884
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:51,902
houses all through there.

885
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:54,195
there’s part of me agrees with the
cousins who don’t want to sell.

886
00:58:54,196 --> 00:58:56,292
They’re going to make a pretty big
stink at the meeting.

887
00:58:56,293 --> 00:58:57,700
But we have to.

888
00:58:57,701 --> 00:59:01,999
The trust dissolves in seven years, and if
we don't sell, it's just gonna be a train rack.

889
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,159
it is a shame, yeah?

890
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,407
On the other hand...

891
00:59:05,408 --> 00:59:07,807
...it's just sitting there.
No one's using it.

892
00:59:07,808 --> 00:59:11,396
At least this way the whole world
will be able to enjoy it.

893
00:59:11,397 --> 00:59:13,531
Take a good look, girls.

894
00:59:13,532 --> 00:59:17,558
This is part of your great-great-great
grandmother’s inheritance...

895
00:59:17,559 --> 00:59:21,556
...going all way back to Kamehameha I.

896
00:59:21,557 --> 00:59:24,632
Down there is where Mom and I would camp.

897
00:59:24,633 --> 00:59:27,167
We all did, all our lives.

898
00:59:27,168 --> 00:59:32,385
lots of memories.

899
00:59:32,386 --> 00:59:36,510
Everything has it's time.

900
00:59:36,511 --> 00:59:37,529
What about me?

901
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:39,565
I want to camp.

902
01:00:29,757 --> 01:00:33,603
By the way. I’m supposed to meet a friend of
mine, I think he is staying here.

903
01:00:33,604 --> 01:00:35,364
And his name is Brian Speer.

904
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:40,119
S- P-E-E-R.

905
01:00:42,176 --> 01:00:44,682
sorry Mr. King, I'm not
showing anybody that name.

906
01:00:44,683 --> 01:00:46,876
Okay, thanks.

907
01:00:56,341 --> 01:00:58,226
Hey, Scottie.

908
01:00:58,227 --> 01:00:59,852
what’s in your suit?

909
01:00:59,853 --> 01:01:01,442
They are my beach boobs.

910
01:01:01,443 --> 01:01:04,243
Take them out of there. Right now.

911
01:01:04,244 --> 01:01:06,328
Jesus Alex, why’d you let her do that? You too, Sid.

912
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:08,242
I do not know. Take them out, stupid!

913
01:01:08,243 --> 01:01:12,058
Yeah, Scottie. Big boobs
look kind of fatty.

914
01:01:19,228 --> 01:01:20,866
Any luck?

915
01:01:20,867 --> 01:01:24,373
The hotels was a dead end, but I took
another shot with his office.

916
01:01:24,374 --> 01:01:26,644
He’s definitely renting a house in Hanalei.

917
01:01:26,645 --> 01:01:32,013
probably one of that cottages around the bay.

918
01:01:32,014 --> 01:01:34,349
I think we should
go for a walk.

919
01:01:34,350 --> 01:01:36,577
Yeah, let's go.

920
01:01:36,578 --> 01:01:38,581
Scottie?

921
01:01:44,192 --> 01:01:46,277
Can we swim with the sharks?

922
01:01:46,278 --> 01:01:50,659
I read in the hotel magazine how they like put
you in the cage in the water...

923
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:52,824
...and they throw shark...

924
01:01:52,825 --> 01:01:54,851
...feed in the water and sharks swim right
up to you.

925
01:01:54,852 --> 01:01:55,786
Can we do that?

926
01:01:55,787 --> 01:01:59,004
Scottie, we’re not really here to do
stuff like that.

927
01:02:00,395 --> 01:02:02,947
What are we gonna do then?

928
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:19,174
How would you and mom meet?

929
01:02:19,175 --> 01:02:22,654
I was with a law school buddy from the
mainland,

930
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:25,505
...and I took him to the club.
We were just coming in from paddling,

931
01:02:25,506 --> 01:02:30,891
and your mom was on her way out, and she looked at me and said,
Do you think it’s going to snow today?

932
01:02:32,221 --> 01:02:33,506
Did it really snow?

933
01:02:33,507 --> 01:02:36,391
stayed dry.

934
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:41,727
I like her stories.
Like how she streaked in wedding.

935
01:02:41,728 --> 01:02:42,547
Oh my God!

936
01:02:42,548 --> 01:02:47,493
There are so many.
As when...

937
01:02:47,494 --> 01:02:49,284
your mom
get chased by a shark...

938
01:02:49,285 --> 01:02:51,448
What?
When that was happened?

939
01:02:51,449 --> 01:02:55,857
We were on Moloka’i with Mark and Kai,

940
01:02:55,858 --> 01:02:58,358
and your mom was out surfing and saw a
shark right beneath her on a wave...

941
01:03:15,736 --> 01:03:16,800
Let’s watch one of these!

942
01:03:16,801 --> 01:03:19,145
No, We’re not watching porn.

943
01:03:19,146 --> 01:03:21,606
- Give me that.
- No.

944
01:03:21,607 --> 01:03:24,412
Reina’s dad watches porn.

945
01:03:24,413 --> 01:03:26,692
Reina calls them masturbation movies.

946
01:03:26,693 --> 01:03:32,460
She plays them when her parents aren’t home
and one time invited boys over to see if they grew down there.

947
01:03:32,461 --> 01:03:33,963
One did.

948
01:03:33,964 --> 01:03:36,049
Reina sounds awesome.

949
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:38,819
Were you there? Did you watch
one of those movies?

950
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:40,201
No.

951
01:03:40,202 --> 01:03:41,783
Hey! Scottie!

952
01:03:41,784 --> 01:03:45,201
Reina is a fucked-up ho-bag, and you
need to stay away from her.

953
01:03:45,202 --> 01:03:48,863
and she is going to be a meth-head,
and she’s going to get used by stupid guys.

954
01:03:48,864 --> 01:03:51,584
She's a twat. Say it.

955
01:03:51,585 --> 01:03:52,725
She’s a twat.

956
01:03:52,726 --> 01:03:54,741
Okay.

957
01:03:54,742 --> 01:03:56,873
- She’s a twat, twat, twat!
- Okay, okay. Stop it!

958
01:03:56,874 --> 01:03:58,037
twat, twat, twat, twat.

959
01:03:58,038 --> 01:04:01,206
...twat, twat, twat, twat...

960
01:04:01,207 --> 01:04:03,741
I don’t get it. I don’t know what to
do...

961
01:04:03,742 --> 01:04:06,636
...these things she does. What goes
on in her head?

962
01:04:06,637 --> 01:04:08,922
You weren’t like that.

963
01:04:08,923 --> 01:04:09,983
It’ll go away.

964
01:04:09,984 --> 01:04:12,534
I’m not so sure. I mean, look how you
kids talk in front of me...

965
01:04:12,535 --> 01:04:15,262
...It's like you don’t respect authority.

966
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:53,116
Hey.

967
01:04:53,117 --> 01:04:53,963
Hi.

968
01:04:53,964 --> 01:04:57,432
Checking on me or something?

969
01:04:57,433 --> 01:04:59,842
I haven’t been sleeping
very much lately.

970
01:04:59,843 --> 01:05:02,717
Understandable.

971
01:05:17,991 --> 01:05:20,650
I’m worried about my daughters.

972
01:05:20,651 --> 01:05:23,577
I think there's something wrong with them.

973
01:05:23,578 --> 01:05:27,570
I used to do some messed-up shit
when I was a kid.

974
01:05:27,571 --> 01:05:29,782
I still do.

975
01:05:29,783 --> 01:05:34,681
It's going to
get worse after your wife dies.

976
01:05:34,682 --> 01:05:37,893
What does Alex really think about this
stuff that’s going on? What does she say?

977
01:05:37,894 --> 01:05:39,399
She doesn't.

978
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,975
What do you mean? I thought she
talks to you all the time.

979
01:05:42,504 --> 01:05:45,105
We don’t really talk about our like
issues.

980
01:05:45,267 --> 01:05:48,854
We just, I don’t know, we deal with our shit by talking about
other stuff and having a good time.

981
01:05:55,909 --> 01:05:57,683
What would you do if you were me?

982
01:05:57,750 --> 01:06:00,670
How would you handle my daughters?

983
01:06:01,283 --> 01:06:04,709
How would you handle... the situation of
this guy we’re trying to find?

984
01:06:04,744 --> 01:06:06,189
I told you, man.

985
01:06:06,415 --> 01:06:10,154
Would I put the nuts on a dresser
and will be hitting with the spiked bat.

986
01:06:11,313 --> 01:06:13,763
With the daughters, I don’t know.

987
01:06:13,790 --> 01:06:15,974
Exchange them for sons, I guess.

988
01:06:15,975 --> 01:06:18,778
Then I might wind up with something
like you.

989
01:06:18,779 --> 01:06:20,441
I’m not so bad.

990
01:06:20,442 --> 01:06:21,476
I’m smart.

991
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:25,129
You’re about a hundred miles away from
Smartville. No offense.

992
01:06:25,130 --> 01:06:27,754
You’re mistaken, counselor.

993
01:06:27,755 --> 01:06:31,838
I’m smart.
I have good hygiene.

994
01:06:31,839 --> 01:06:33,774
I’m an decent
guitarist,

995
01:06:33,775 --> 01:06:37,748
a good cook. I cook food
all the time.

996
01:06:37,749 --> 01:06:40,274
I’m vice-president of
the Punahou chess club.

997
01:06:40,908 --> 01:06:42,364
And I always
have weed.

998
01:06:44,002 --> 01:06:45,532
Your mom must
be very proud.

999
01:06:47,347 --> 01:06:48,464
It’s possible.

1000
01:06:48,773 --> 01:06:51,310
My mom’s sort of busy
right now.

1001
01:06:51,452 --> 01:06:53,247
Yes. What does she do, your mom?

1002
01:06:53,557 --> 01:06:55,730
She’s a receptionist at a pet clinic.

1003
01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:59,878
But mostly she’s been getting the house
together after my dad died.

1004
01:07:00,004 --> 01:07:02,187
My dad died a few months ago

1005
01:07:06,150 --> 01:07:07,835
November 24th.

1006
01:07:08,398 --> 01:07:09,782
Drunk driver.

1007
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:13,840
Actually
both drivers were drunk. Yeah.

1008
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:15,616
Yes.

1009
01:07:30,553 --> 01:07:31,541
Good night, Sid.

1010
01:07:33,234 --> 01:07:34,037
Good night, boss.

1011
01:07:37,443 --> 01:07:41,025
I’ll see you in the morning.

1012
01:10:34,876 --> 01:10:38,892
Stay in the zone, please! That means
you, Skylar. And you too, Colt.

1013
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:44,920
Watch your sister,
I’ll be right back.

1014
01:11:03,704 --> 01:11:05,653
Looks like you got yourself a handful
with those two.

1015
01:11:07,153 --> 01:11:08,130
Yes.

1016
01:11:09,106 --> 01:11:09,900
Yes.

1017
01:11:09,935 --> 01:11:11,128
Must keep you pretty busy.

1018
01:11:11,842 --> 01:11:15,530
They’re pretty non-stop, but they’re at
a really fun age.

1019
01:11:15,531 --> 01:11:16,906
How old are they?

1020
01:11:16,907 --> 01:11:17,907
Eight and ten.

1021
01:11:19,051 --> 01:11:20,245
I have two girls.

1022
01:11:20,803 --> 01:11:21,967
Ten and seventeen.

1023
01:11:22,207 --> 01:11:24,772
That whole non-stop thing. That never
changes.

1024
01:11:26,809 --> 01:11:27,820
You guys live here?

1025
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:29,863
- Oahu.
- Oh, so do we.

1026
01:11:33,926 --> 01:11:36,356
Yeah, I’m just getting my girls out of
town for a couple days.

1027
01:11:36,391 --> 01:11:39,028
their mother is in the hospital, so I
thought I’d give them a little break.

1028
01:11:39,208 --> 01:11:40,186
Oh, no.

1029
01:11:42,001 --> 01:11:44,124
What’s wrong? If you don’t mind my
asking.

1030
01:11:44,792 --> 01:11:47,276
Just a little boating accident. Hit
her head a little too hard.

1031
01:11:51,123 --> 01:11:51,938
A sailboat?

1032
01:11:52,167 --> 01:11:53,162
Or one with a motor?

1033
01:11:55,497 --> 01:11:56,395
One with a motor.

1034
01:11:58,204 --> 01:12:00,501
Well, good luck with that.
I wish her well.

1035
01:12:02,217 --> 01:12:03,957
Not so long Skailer.

1036
01:12:07,721 --> 01:12:10,591
You guys staying in one of the cottages
here?

1037
01:12:10,742 --> 01:12:16,498
Yes, my husband had to come here for
work, so we thought we’d all make a little vacation of it.

1038
01:12:16,499 --> 01:12:18,266
He knows the owner, so...

1039
01:12:18,301 --> 01:12:20,033
- Hugh King.
- That’s right.

1040
01:12:20,068 --> 01:12:21,097
He’s my cousin.

1041
01:12:21,132 --> 01:12:24,681
Oh. Then you probably know my husband.
Brian Speer?

1042
01:12:27,761 --> 01:12:28,938
No, can’t say as I do.

1043
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:33,101
Oh, I just assumed, since he’s been...

1044
01:12:33,309 --> 01:12:34,068
Dad!

1045
01:12:34,491 --> 01:12:35,670
Something bit me!

1046
01:12:37,365 --> 01:12:38,534
Nice talking to you.

1047
01:12:39,602 --> 01:12:40,918
You too. Take care.

1048
01:13:31,790 --> 01:13:32,717
There’s Cousin Hugh.

1049
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:34,569
Get us a table.
Order me something.

1050
01:13:34,604 --> 01:13:35,269
What do you want?

1051
01:13:35,304 --> 01:13:35,926
Anything.

1052
01:13:43,546 --> 01:13:44,156
Hey, Hugh?

1053
01:13:45,142 --> 01:13:47,624
Heeey! Mattie-boy!

1054
01:13:48,124 --> 01:13:49,374
What are you doing
here?

1055
01:13:49,491 --> 01:13:51,445
I didn’t expect to see you until the meeting.

1056
01:13:51,527 --> 01:13:54,310
Just getting the girls out of the
hospital for a couple days,

1057
01:13:54,311 --> 01:13:56,813
- Oh, these are...
- Scottie and Alex.

1058
01:13:56,814 --> 01:13:58,520
Big girls now!

1059
01:13:58,521 --> 01:14:01,050
Yes, just needed
a change of scenery.

1060
01:14:01,051 --> 01:14:03,818
Yeah, boy, what you’ve been going
through. That’s a tough deal.

1061
01:14:03,819 --> 01:14:04,537
Yes.

1062
01:14:04,538 --> 01:14:08,134
But Elizabeth, hey, she’s, she’s a
tough gal, I’ll tell you that.

1063
01:14:08,135 --> 01:14:10,042
A fighter. She’ll make it.

1064
01:14:10,853 --> 01:14:11,598
Get you a drink?

1065
01:14:12,038 --> 01:14:13,868
Yes, what you have

1066
01:14:13,952 --> 01:14:15,598
- Julia?
- Hey.

1067
01:14:15,633 --> 01:14:17,704
- an old-fashioned for my cousin here.
- all right.

1068
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:21,127
- Glad to see you, Matt.
- Me too.

1069
01:14:21,578 --> 01:14:23,018
How you been otherwise?

1070
01:14:23,955 --> 01:14:25,304
Not much otherwise.

1071
01:14:25,393 --> 01:14:28,566
Between our business and the hospital, you know,
trying to keep my head above water.

1072
01:14:29,849 --> 01:14:32,413
listen, I see you have some
people staying in the cottage.

1073
01:14:33,723 --> 01:14:36,117
Oh, hey, Mattie, if I’d known you were
coming, I coulda...

1074
01:14:36,118 --> 01:14:38,934
No, no, no, not that at all.

1075
01:14:38,935 --> 01:14:40,791
I’m just wondering about
the guy you’re renting to.

1076
01:14:40,792 --> 01:14:42,851
I think his
name is Brian Speer.

1077
01:14:43,919 --> 01:14:46,887
Yeah, yeah, real determined son-of-a-bitch.

1078
01:14:47,608 --> 01:14:49,234
He’s Lou’s sister’s...

1079
01:14:50,213 --> 01:14:53,220
No, wait. Lou has a sister, and the
sister’s husband

1080
01:14:53,221 --> 01:14:56,270
Lou’s brother-in-law is cousins with that guy.

1081
01:14:59,053 --> 01:14:59,780
Who’s Lou?

1082
01:15:00,295 --> 01:15:05,052
No, wait. You mean the cottages on the
bay or the cottage back by the trail?

1083
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:07,696
The bay. The guy with the wife and two
boys.

1084
01:15:07,924 --> 01:15:10,680
Yeah, that’s right. Determined son-of-
a- bitch.

1085
01:15:11,688 --> 01:15:15,731
Anyway, the point is the guy we’re doing
business with is that guy’s brother-in-law.

1086
01:15:15,766 --> 01:15:16,759
Works for him.

1087
01:15:16,921 --> 01:15:18,444
What do you mean, the guy we’re doing
business with?

1088
01:15:18,807 --> 01:15:24,474
Who do you think? Don!
Who else? Holitzer.

1089
01:15:25,126 --> 01:15:25,821
Holitzer.

1090
01:15:26,303 --> 01:15:29,913
That’s what I’m saying. That’s Don’s
brother-in-law in the cottage.

1091
01:15:30,445 --> 01:15:31,796
Brian Speer.

1092
01:15:32,009 --> 01:15:35,110
You don’t know him? I would have thought
you’d know him. He’s a realtor over by you.

1093
01:15:35,424 --> 01:15:37,109
So if we sell to Don

1094
01:15:37,144 --> 01:15:39,610
and that’s what we’re going to do, right?
That’s what you want too.

1095
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:41,950
Nice guy, Don. He’ll do right by us.

1096
01:15:42,307 --> 01:15:47,722
Then when Don develops and re-sells and
leases and all that...

1097
01:15:47,723 --> 01:15:51,034
He’s letting this brother-in-law in the
cottage handle the transactions.

1098
01:15:51,035 --> 01:15:52,198
A lot of them, anyway.

1099
01:15:52,199 --> 01:15:53,982
Big score for that guy.

1100
01:16:03,515 --> 01:16:07,505
This afternoon will be
us a good voice, my nephew.

1101
01:16:07,517 --> 01:16:08,636
From here the Ke'ola.

1102
01:16:09,758 --> 01:16:11,058
Hugh, what's he like?

1103
01:16:12,332 --> 01:16:13,024
Who?

1104
01:16:13,983 --> 01:16:15,033
Brian Speer

1105
01:16:15,068 --> 01:16:16,440
what else do you know
about him?

1106
01:16:16,486 --> 01:16:22,313
Not much. He’s lucky. Son-of-a-bitch is going
to make a shitload of money on commissions.

1107
01:16:23,809 --> 01:16:25,249
Not if we don’t go with that bid.

1108
01:16:29,434 --> 01:16:30,887
We all want Don.

1109
01:16:31,904 --> 01:16:34,055
You do too, Matt.
You’ve said as much.

1110
01:16:39,288 --> 01:16:42,068
Yes. I’m just... You're right.

1111
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:49,087
Hugh, Good to see you, Hugh.

1112
01:16:49,888 --> 01:16:51,081
You too.

1113
01:16:52,936 --> 01:16:54,571
- See you at the meeting.
- I’ll be there.

1114
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:24,940
This place rocks.

1115
01:17:25,121 --> 01:17:26,676
Totally.

1116
01:17:28,402 --> 01:17:29,793
We ordered your mahi.

1117
01:17:31,798 --> 01:17:32,508
Great.

1118
01:18:01,427 --> 01:18:03,543
Well, guess what. That
woman on the beach today...

1119
01:18:03,578 --> 01:18:04,678
That was his wife.

1120
01:18:04,947 --> 01:18:06,542
- Whose wife?
- Brian Speer

1121
01:18:06,636 --> 01:18:07,300
What?

1122
01:18:08,056 --> 01:18:09,092
The hottie with the hat?

1123
01:18:09,127 --> 01:18:10,129
Yes.
- Are you sure?

1124
01:18:10,172 --> 01:18:10,626
Yes.

1125
01:18:10,627 --> 01:18:12,219
So he’s married.

1126
01:18:13,376 --> 01:18:16,243
- Why didn’t you say anything?
- It’s him I want to talk to, not her.

1127
01:18:16,421 --> 01:18:17,754
I know where their cottage is.

1128
01:18:18,357 --> 01:18:19,086
You do?

1129
01:18:19,216 --> 01:18:21,055
So let’s do it right now.
Let’s go knock on his door.

1130
01:18:21,056 --> 01:18:21,938
That’s what I’m saying.

1131
01:18:23,472 --> 01:18:25,957
Don’t do that. Don’t be excited. This
isn’t fun.

1132
01:18:25,958 --> 01:18:27,329
Well, it’s what we came here to do.

1133
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:28,560
Right.

1134
01:18:29,929 --> 01:18:31,731
So you to talk to his wife while I talk
to him.

1135
01:18:31,766 --> 01:18:34,529
And figure out some way to
distract Scottie and their kids.

1136
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:36,186
Got it.

1137
01:18:36,342 --> 01:18:37,203
Sid, come here.

1138
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:39,892
Give ‘em hell, boss.

1139
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:41,026
Come on, Sid.

1140
01:18:42,826 --> 01:18:43,428
Ok

1141
01:18:54,808 --> 01:18:56,344
I’m sorry for sucking you into this.

1142
01:18:56,508 --> 01:18:57,991
should be doing this alone.

1143
01:18:58,026 --> 01:19:00,030
- It’s selfish of me.
- I’m the one who sucked you in.

1144
01:19:00,072 --> 01:19:01,291
I’m the one who knew.

1145
01:19:09,192 --> 01:19:10,140
Don’t be a pussy.

1146
01:19:11,393 --> 01:19:12,276
Hi there!

1147
01:19:14,192 --> 01:19:15,603
It’s the guy from the beach today.

1148
01:19:15,728 --> 01:19:17,175
Oh, hello.

1149
01:19:17,236 --> 01:19:19,358
Yeah, hey, I’m such an idiot.

1150
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:22,515
I just figured out I do know your husband.

1151
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:27,957
My daughter and I were on our way back to the hotel from dinner,
and we thought we’d drop by and say howdy.

1152
01:19:29,369 --> 01:19:30,974
- Great. Come on up.
Yes.

1153
01:19:31,617 --> 01:19:34,654
I’m Matt King. This is Alexandra.

1154
01:19:35,285 --> 01:19:36,600
- I’m Julie Speer.
- Hi.

1155
01:19:36,601 --> 01:19:39,907
Yeah, I thought that was you.
You’ve been in the paper so much lately.

1156
01:19:40,109 --> 01:19:42,785
I figured you had to know
Brian. He’s been pretty involved.

1157
01:19:42,786 --> 01:19:44,418
Yeah, no, I know, yeah, super-involved.

1158
01:19:44,419 --> 01:19:47,204
Maybe I’ve met him in passing.
I don’t know.

1159
01:19:47,354 --> 01:19:51,777
So, I guess you guys are deciding really soon.
A couple of days, right right... you and your family meet?

1160
01:19:52,401 --> 01:19:55,004
I’m sorry. That’s probably a conflict
of interest or something.

1161
01:19:55,005 --> 01:19:56,424
No, it’s okay. You’re right

1162
01:19:57,370 --> 01:19:58,675
it’ll all be over in a couple of days.

1163
01:20:00,252 --> 01:20:01,649
You guys want a lasagna?

1164
01:20:02,051 --> 01:20:03,136
No, thanks We just ate,

1165
01:20:03,458 --> 01:20:04,672
A drink then.

1166
01:20:04,673 --> 01:20:05,650
sure

1167
01:20:05,651 --> 01:20:06,824
Red wine, iced tea?

1168
01:20:06,825 --> 01:20:07,597
- Perfect.
Yes.

1169
01:20:07,632 --> 01:20:08,202
Hello!

1170
01:20:08,203 --> 01:20:09,800
- Hi.
- Hey.

1171
01:20:10,602 --> 01:20:12,010
Hi, I’m Brian.

1172
01:20:12,132 --> 01:20:14,333
Brian, we may have met before.

1173
01:20:14,609 --> 01:20:15,562
Matt King.

1174
01:20:16,104 --> 01:20:19,087
My wife is Elizabeth King.
I think you may have met her too.

1175
01:20:19,999 --> 01:20:21,244
And this is her daughter, Alexandra.

1176
01:20:21,672 --> 01:20:23,489
I was just going to get drinks.

1177
01:20:24,943 --> 01:20:26,067
Good, good. Good.

1178
01:20:26,744 --> 01:20:28,484
- Do you need help?
No, no, I got it.

1179
01:20:32,264 --> 01:20:33,552
Elizabeth is dying.

1180
01:20:35,434 --> 01:20:37,073
Oh, wait. Fuck
you

1181
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:38,840
And she’s dying.

1182
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:42,296
We unhooked her from the machines this morning.
She’ll be dead in a few days.

1183
01:20:45,708 --> 01:20:47,092
- This is him?
- Mmchmm.

1184
01:20:47,286 --> 01:20:49,682
- How would she go for him?
- Beats me.

1185
01:20:49,809 --> 01:20:51,777
Well, he’s very articulate.

1186
01:20:54,178 --> 01:20:56,403
I’m sorry. I never thought
it would come to this.

1187
01:20:56,493 --> 01:20:58,008
You’re sorry my mom’s going to die?

1188
01:20:58,043 --> 01:21:00,918
You’re sorry you fucked her?
You’re sorry you fucked over my dad?

1189
01:21:01,912 --> 01:21:03,150
I’m sorry for all of it.

1190
01:21:03,266 --> 01:21:07,258
Look, pal, like she said, I’m not here to wreck your life. I just came to
give you a chance to go to the hospital.

1191
01:21:07,824 --> 01:21:11,445
I don’t know how long you’re planning on being
here, but I’m sure you can think of an excuse to leave.

1192
01:21:11,632 --> 01:21:12,787
You must be good at that.

1193
01:21:12,822 --> 01:21:15,256
You can be alone with her to say
goodbye or whatever

1194
01:21:16,746 --> 01:21:17,540
Do you hear what I’m saying?

1195
01:21:18,202 --> 01:21:20,542
Okay, look, I can’t have you here. You
understand.

1196
01:21:21,757 --> 01:21:22,591
Here we go.

1197
01:21:25,536 --> 01:21:26,448
Thank you.

1198
01:21:27,624 --> 01:21:30,925
Everyone’s so serious. Please don’t
tell me you’re talking about business.

1199
01:21:31,685 --> 01:21:32,941
We’re talking about love.

1200
01:21:33,188 --> 01:21:34,205
This is nice.

1201
01:21:34,340 --> 01:21:36,618
Brian, call the boys in for dinner.

1202
01:21:36,653 --> 01:21:38,843
They’re fine. Let them play a while
longer.

1203
01:21:43,829 --> 01:21:46,129
Awesome cottage you’re renting.

1204
01:21:46,164 --> 01:21:48,395
Yeah, say, prime Hanalei location.

1205
01:21:48,430 --> 01:21:51,567
I used to come here as a kid before it
was a vacation property.

1206
01:21:52,092 --> 01:21:56,191
Alex, your great-uncle Warren and Aunt Lillian
built it back in the 20s.

1207
01:21:56,513 --> 01:21:58,424
Haven’t been
inside in years.

1208
01:21:58,425 --> 01:21:59,902
Come on. We’ll give you a tour.

1209
01:21:59,937 --> 01:22:04,521
Or, Brian, maybe you could give my dad a little
walk down memory lane, and Julie and I can chat out here.

1210
01:22:04,522 --> 01:22:06,786
Yeah, I’d like that, if you don’t mind.

1211
01:22:06,787 --> 01:22:07,645
Just a quick look.

1212
01:22:10,627 --> 01:22:14,357
Yes. But it’s not like I live here anything.
but OK

1213
01:22:15,709 --> 01:22:16,886
Can you keep it?

1214
01:22:17,181 --> 01:22:18,622
Go from here.

1215
01:22:29,983 --> 01:22:30,944
Here it is.

1216
01:22:33,099 --> 01:22:34,712
How did you meet? I’m curious

1217
01:22:35,178 --> 01:22:36,247
I can’t do this.

1218
01:22:36,353 --> 01:22:37,962
Neither can I. How did you meet?

1219
01:22:38,552 --> 01:22:40,528
I thought you said you came here just
to tell me.

1220
01:22:41,253 --> 01:22:44,789
I changed my mind. And I can’t very
well ask her the details. can I

1221
01:22:46,319 --> 01:22:47,117
How’d you meet?

1222
01:22:49,709 --> 01:22:50,570
At a party.

1223
01:22:51,228 --> 01:22:53,072
- What party?
Super Bowl party

1224
01:22:55,958 --> 01:22:56,974
At the Mitchells’

1225
01:22:57,964 --> 01:22:59,594
Does that help? Does that make it
better?

1226
01:22:59,629 --> 01:23:03,641
Hey, I’m doing you a favor here. I
could go out there right now and fuck you up,

1227
01:23:03,676 --> 01:23:05,107
so get a better attitude.

1228
01:23:06,715 --> 01:23:07,664
Then what?

1229
01:23:08,239 --> 01:23:10,285
How’d you get the nerve to ask
her out?

1230
01:23:10,331 --> 01:23:12,951
Was it about the deal?
Is that when you decided she was for you?

1231
01:23:12,964 --> 01:23:13,129
No.

1232
01:23:13,666 --> 01:23:14,881
It’s not what you think.

1233
01:23:14,942 --> 01:23:16,451
It just happened.

1234
01:23:16,648 --> 01:23:17,807
Nothing just happens.

1235
01:23:17,808 --> 01:23:19,050
Everything just happens.

1236
01:23:21,086 --> 01:23:22,164
Was she going to leave me?

1237
01:23:22,917 --> 01:23:24,009
She would have.

1238
01:23:24,775 --> 01:23:26,684
But I, I, uh... I
didn’t want that happened.

1239
01:23:27,027 --> 01:23:28,595
I love Julie.

1240
01:23:30,951 --> 01:23:32,347
Please don’t tell her.

1241
01:23:33,557 --> 01:23:34,667
Please.

1242
01:23:35,558 --> 01:23:38,038
I don’t know what I’ve done. I’m sorry.

1243
01:23:39,635 --> 01:23:41,250
Did she say she loved you?

1244
01:23:52,642 --> 01:23:53,618
Do you love her?

1245
01:24:01,357 --> 01:24:02,487
You don’t love her.

1246
01:24:03,667 --> 01:24:06,511
You don’t love
her. You just used her to get to me.

1247
01:24:07,117 --> 01:24:08,942
No, I told you. I wasn’t trying to get
to you.

1248
01:24:09,945 --> 01:24:10,845
It was an affair,

1249
01:24:11,778 --> 01:24:16,437
an attraction. Sex. And she got sort of... carried away
with the whole thing, and I guess I went with it.

1250
01:24:16,447 --> 01:24:20,030
I mean, I didn’t exactly
say no to things. I should have. I love my family.

1251
01:24:21,283 --> 01:24:25,486
Then I guess it’s all working out. Her lips are sealed,
and you don’t have to go through the trouble of dumping her.

1252
01:24:26,139 --> 01:24:30,653
Hey, hey, that’s really unfair. I had..
have... a lot of respect for her.

1253
01:24:31,576 --> 01:24:32,935
She’s a wonderful woman.

1254
01:24:35,116 --> 01:24:36,665
One more question for you

1255
01:24:38,172 --> 01:24:38,788
Yes?

1256
01:24:41,326 --> 01:24:42,814
Have you ever been inside my bedroom?

1257
01:24:48,614 --> 01:24:49,576
Once.

1258
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:57,486
You could have had the decency to lie
about that one.

1259
01:24:59,123 --> 01:24:59,843
Okay, two.

1260
01:25:06,353 --> 01:25:08,493
Well, she’s in Queen’s
Hospital if you want to say goodbye.

1261
01:25:09,817 --> 01:25:11,326
That really is all I came to say.

1262
01:25:16,428 --> 01:25:19,446
that's great, all remodeled, new
appliances.

1263
01:25:19,582 --> 01:25:20,293
Nice.

1264
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:22,284
Alex, I think we should go.

1265
01:25:23,207 --> 01:25:25,292
Well, hey, thanks for stopping by.

1266
01:25:25,464 --> 01:25:27,989
Really nice to meet you both. Maybe
we’ll see you at the beach tomorrow.

1267
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:28,969
Yes, maybe.

1268
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:30,198
Nice to meet you.

1269
01:25:55,648 --> 01:25:56,230
Hey.

1270
01:25:56,715 --> 01:25:58,319
So when do you think he’ll show up?

1271
01:25:59,233 --> 01:26:00,408
I have no idea.

1272
01:26:00,482 --> 01:26:02,008
Was he sorry?

1273
01:26:02,539 --> 01:26:04,089
I hope he was sorry, man.

1274
01:26:04,215 --> 01:26:06,616
You could have told his wife, and
you didn’t.

1275
01:26:06,788 --> 01:26:10,813
I would say everything. I mean..
I hope he knows how lucky he is.

1276
01:26:10,848 --> 01:26:12,730
She deserves to know.

1277
01:26:12,731 --> 01:26:15,584
Or else she’s going to be a dumb bitch the
rest of her life.

1278
01:26:15,585 --> 01:26:16,273
Sid.

1279
01:26:16,649 --> 01:26:17,714
I’m just saying.

1280
01:26:18,569 --> 01:26:20,222
No need to get creepy about it

1281
01:26:21,334 --> 01:26:23,260
Anyway, doesn’t
matter. That’s all behind us.

1282
01:26:23,857 --> 01:26:28,309
Yeah, the one we have to worry about
telling things to now is Scottie.

1283
01:26:30,013 --> 01:26:33,633
I’ve asked Dr. Johnston to help us
break the news tomorrow.

1284
01:28:34,765 --> 01:28:35,520
Here we are.

1285
01:28:38,070 --> 01:28:38,644
Hey.

1286
01:28:40,294 --> 01:28:41,348
- Hey, Barry.
- Hey.

1287
01:28:44,923 --> 01:28:46,132
- Hi, Alice.
- Hey, Barry.

1288
01:28:46,294 --> 01:28:47,742
- Hi, Alex.
- Glad to see you.

1289
01:28:48,945 --> 01:28:49,642
Scott.

1290
01:28:50,036 --> 01:28:51,038
Hi, Tutu.

1291
01:28:52,481 --> 01:28:57,369
Alex, we will... e.. bring some
chairs for Tutu, right?

1292
01:29:04,138 --> 01:29:05,272
There you are again.

1293
01:29:11,302 --> 01:29:11,960
so...

1294
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,320
what did you decide?

1295
01:29:14,952 --> 01:29:17,127
There’s not much left to decide.

1296
01:29:17,162 --> 01:29:19,480
We’re just sort of playing it by ear and
making sure she’s comfortable.

1297
01:29:19,515 --> 01:29:21,194
I mean what did you decide about the
buyer?

1298
01:29:21,899 --> 01:29:22,723
Who’s your buyer?

1299
01:29:23,743 --> 01:29:24,722
How much are you getting?

1300
01:29:26,155 --> 01:29:26,989
Dad...

1301
01:29:27,445 --> 01:29:29,445
I’m sure you’ll be able to read
about it in the paper.

1302
01:29:29,630 --> 01:29:32,287
I don’t need to read about it. I can
hear about it right now.

1303
01:29:32,322 --> 01:29:34,259
Scott, let’s not talk about that here.
It’s not the time for that.

1304
01:29:34,590 --> 01:29:37,643
All the same to you, I guess. A
million here, a million there.

1305
01:29:38,297 --> 01:29:40,005
Just ironic, that’s all

1306
01:29:40,236 --> 01:29:44,690
Elizabeth coming into this misfortune just as you’re
coming into a fortune.

1307
01:29:46,586 --> 01:29:47,983
She gave you
everything, Matt.

1308
01:29:48,586 --> 01:29:50,794
A good, happy home,
two beautiful daughters.

1309
01:29:50,795 --> 01:29:51,379
Scott, what’s your point?

1310
01:29:51,380 --> 01:29:53,902
She wanted her own boat. She should
have had her own boat,

1311
01:29:54,033 --> 01:29:56,466
- one she would have been familiar with.
- She wasn’t even driving!

1312
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:59,658
Her boat,
someone else’s boat... it wouldn’t matter

1313
01:29:59,803 --> 01:30:01,071
You’re not going
to blame me for this.

1314
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:03,564
quibble about the details.

1315
01:30:04,645 --> 01:30:07,490
She was a faithful, devoted wife. She
deserved more.

1316
01:30:15,252 --> 01:30:16,634
You’re right. She deserved more.

1317
01:30:18,347 --> 01:30:19,670
For Christ’s sake,

1318
01:30:20,030 --> 01:30:20,926
take it easy on the man.

1319
01:30:20,961 --> 01:30:25,017
You know, My father has been doing a really
amazing job under the circumstances.

1320
01:30:37,428 --> 01:30:38,494
Are we leaving?

1321
01:30:38,522 --> 01:30:39,882
No, Mom, not yet.

1322
01:30:47,881 --> 01:30:49,400
Man, that guy’s a prick.

1323
01:30:50,316 --> 01:30:51,412
Was he always
like that?

1324
01:30:51,825 --> 01:30:52,635
Yes.

1325
01:34:31,229 --> 01:34:35,390
Well, no surprise. Other than the
hold outs who don’t want to sell at all,

1326
01:34:35,602 --> 01:34:38,020
it’s Don Holitzer.
Chicago group a distant second.

1327
01:34:38,508 --> 01:34:39,374
Feels good.

1328
01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:41,226
We’re doing the right thing, Mattie.

1329
01:34:41,563 --> 01:34:43,512
At least there ain’t going to be any
Wal-Mart.

1330
01:34:45,018 --> 01:34:45,585
All right.

1331
01:34:47,408 --> 01:34:49,829
Now it’s your call, and
we’re all behind you,

1332
01:34:50,052 --> 01:34:51,366
most of us anyway.

1333
01:34:52,359 --> 01:34:54,212
Go ahead, Captain. Make it official.

1334
01:35:08,198 --> 01:35:09,325
It’s strange, that’s all.

1335
01:35:11,176 --> 01:35:12,262
What’s strange?

1336
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:17,527
We didn’t do anything to own that land.
It was entrusted to us.

1337
01:35:18,183 --> 01:35:19,009
And now we’re just...

1338
01:35:29,665 --> 01:35:30,775
I can’t do it.

1339
01:35:31,948 --> 01:35:32,671
I won’t do it.

1340
01:35:32,865 --> 01:35:34,441
- What do you mean?
- I’m not going to sign.

1341
01:35:38,378 --> 01:35:39,879
What’re you doing, Matt?

1342
01:35:41,048 --> 01:35:45,033
I mean, we know you have a lot on your plate right now,
but you’re not going to fuck this up for us.

1343
01:35:45,159 --> 01:35:45,962
It’s over.

1344
01:35:48,237 --> 01:35:49,709
I don’t want it to go to Holitzer.

1345
01:35:50,711 --> 01:35:51,905
I don’t want it to go to anyone.

1346
01:35:53,317 --> 01:35:54,151
I want to keep it.

1347
01:35:55,061 --> 01:35:56,486
Your head’s not right, Mattie.

1348
01:35:56,961 --> 01:35:58,019
Your head’s not right.

1349
01:35:59,356 --> 01:36:02,026
You want a couple
days to think it over? Take a couple days.

1350
01:36:02,909 --> 01:36:06,422
don’t need a couple days. I have the
authority, and this is what I want.

1351
01:36:07,745 --> 01:36:11,785
We have other businesses we’re
converting to corporations. We can figure it out.

1352
01:36:12,502 --> 01:36:13,827
You’re the trustee.

1353
01:36:14,012 --> 01:36:16,641
You know better than anyone we
only have seven years left.

1354
01:36:17,466 --> 01:36:19,796
Then I have seven years to figure out
how to keep it.

1355
01:36:27,557 --> 01:36:28,747
We’ll come after you.

1356
01:36:29,019 --> 01:36:33,364
Just because you’re a lawyer doesn’t mean the rest
of us would be afraid to come after you.

1357
01:36:34,509 --> 01:36:36,341
But nobody wants to do that.

1358
01:36:38,445 --> 01:36:39,540
We’re family.

1359
01:36:41,463 --> 01:36:44,771
People will be relieved, Hugh, the
whole state.

1360
01:36:46,489 --> 01:36:50,319
I sign that document, Something
that was ours to protect will be gone.

1361
01:36:50,354 --> 01:36:52,537
we’re haole as shit

1362
01:36:53,472 --> 01:36:58,100
and go to private schools and clubs and can’t
even speak pidgin, let alone Hawaiian,

1363
01:36:59,919 --> 01:37:01,559
But we have Hawaiian blood.

1364
01:37:02,247 --> 01:37:03,794
and we’re still tied to this land.

1365
01:37:03,970 --> 01:37:06,080
And our children are tied to this land.

1366
01:37:07,175 --> 01:37:13,049
It’s a miracle that for whatever bullshit
reason 150 years ago, we own this much of... paradise, but we do.

1367
01:37:13,838 --> 01:37:19,276
And for whatever bullshit reason now,
I’m the trustee.

1368
01:37:20,415 --> 01:37:21,595
And I’m not signing.

1369
01:37:22,179 --> 01:37:24,951
And if you sue me, it’ll only make us closer.

1370
01:37:38,950 --> 01:37:39,740
All right.

1371
01:37:42,307 --> 01:37:44,661
everybody, listen up.

1372
01:37:47,692 --> 01:37:49,535
Cousin Mattie has an announcement.

1373
01:37:51,439 --> 01:37:52,432
Get ready.

1374
01:38:56,672 --> 01:38:57,372
come in

1375
01:39:15,557 --> 01:39:16,319
Julie?

1376
01:39:17,465 --> 01:39:22,479
I know we just met, but I was thinking
about you guys these past few days,

1377
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:26,105
I knew your mom was here. I don’t
know. I just felt I should stop by.

1378
01:39:28,832 --> 01:39:29,989
You remember Alex.

1379
01:39:30,024 --> 01:39:30,607
- Hi.
- Hi.

1380
01:39:30,642 --> 01:39:33,837
This is Scottie.
Sid. This is Mrs. Speer.

1381
01:39:33,872 --> 01:39:34,473
Julie.

1382
01:39:35,159 --> 01:39:35,531
Julie.

1383
01:39:35,566 --> 01:39:36,924
Were you friends with my mom?

1384
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:41,022
No, we never met. But I know a lot
about her.

1385
01:39:43,487 --> 01:39:46,512
Look, Julie, we appreciate your coming by.

1386
01:39:48,263 --> 01:39:49,366
The flowers are lovely.

1387
01:39:52,991 --> 01:39:57,327
- Scottie, Alex. Let’s go to the cafeteria.
- Okay. Yes.

1388
01:39:57,362 --> 01:39:58,548
Come get up Scotty.

1389
01:39:58,583 --> 01:40:01,062
- I come.
- Come on, Scotty.

1390
01:40:02,531 --> 01:40:04,471
I wanted two more seconds.

1391
01:40:05,648 --> 01:40:07,265
- Scotty.
- coming!

1392
01:40:20,504 --> 01:40:23,858
I, uh, I’m not sure how much you know
about my wife’s condition,

1393
01:40:24,925 --> 01:40:26,492
but she’s
going to die very soon.

1394
01:40:27,688 --> 01:40:29,364
Basically for this reason we are here.

1395
01:40:29,610 --> 01:40:30,674
I know.

1396
01:40:31,905 --> 01:40:34,084
That’s why I came. Because I
know.

1397
01:40:38,623 --> 01:40:40,249
I came because Brian wouldn’t.

1398
01:40:40,460 --> 01:40:43,425
And that just didn’t seem right. I thought someone from my
family should come.

1399
01:40:46,034 --> 01:40:46,957
So he told you, huh?

1400
01:40:47,631 --> 01:40:52,531
he was acting really weird. that night,
After you left Then I started smelling it all over him.

1401
01:40:54,801 --> 01:40:56,100
I’d already smelled it.

1402
01:40:57,864 --> 01:41:01,087
I finally got it out of him. We’ve
been going crazy ever since.

1403
01:41:01,122 --> 01:41:04,584
Not easy
with the kids around.

1404
01:41:06,725 --> 01:41:08,989
It’s all
something I never could have imagined.

1405
01:41:09,750 --> 01:41:14,717
And then your family’s decision about
the land. I think you’re doing the right thing,

1406
01:41:14,752 --> 01:41:19,912
but Brian is... well, it’s
all so complicated and confusing.

1407
01:41:20,993 --> 01:41:21,576
I know.

1408
01:41:25,467 --> 01:41:26,618
I’m angry,

1409
01:41:27,516 --> 01:41:29,089
but I’m just so sorry.

1410
01:41:31,268 --> 01:41:33,500
I can’t imagine what you’re going
through.

1411
01:41:35,341 --> 01:41:37,053
Do you mind if I say
something to her?

1412
01:41:40,675 --> 01:41:41,712
Ok

1413
01:41:55,265 --> 01:41:56,936
Elizabeth, I’m Julie.

1414
01:41:58,438 --> 01:41:59,832
Brian’s wife.

1415
01:42:06,476 --> 01:42:07,803
I just wanted to tell you...

1416
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:12,165
I just want to tell you I forgive you.

1417
01:42:17,586 --> 01:42:20,046
I forgive you for trying to take Brian away

1418
01:42:22,078 --> 01:42:25,552
I forgive you for almost destroying my
family.

1419
01:42:27,789 --> 01:42:29,778
Why should I forgive you...

1420
01:42:30,148 --> 01:42:32,731
I have to forgive you.

1421
01:42:32,873 --> 01:42:34,963
Even though I want to hate you.

1422
01:42:35,261 --> 01:42:36,679
Okay. That’s enough,

1423
01:42:36,714 --> 01:42:38,062
I have to forgive you.

1424
01:42:38,097 --> 01:42:39,533
Frankly, I think that is enough.

1425
01:42:39,568 --> 01:42:40,905
Okay? Come, go.

1426
01:42:40,940 --> 01:42:42,242
Thank you, Julie.

1427
01:42:47,389 --> 01:42:49,239
He didn’t love her. Just so you know.

1428
01:42:49,816 --> 01:42:51,115
He didn’t really love her.

1429
01:42:52,545 --> 01:42:54,159
That's why I came.

1430
01:42:57,510 --> 01:42:58,081
All right.

1431
01:44:06,941 --> 01:44:08,116
Goodbye, Elizabeth.

1432
01:44:11,583 --> 01:44:12,908
Goodbye, my love.

1433
01:44:15,083 --> 01:44:16,132
my friend,

1434
01:44:17,854 --> 01:44:19,039
my pain,

1435
01:44:20,976 --> 01:44:22,104
my joy.

1436
01:44:26,779 --> 01:44:28,247
Goodbye.

1437
01:44:30,111 --> 01:44:31,077
Goodbye.

1438
01:44:32,327 --> 01:44:33,376
Goodbye.

1439
01:47:30,235 --> 01:47:31,156
I guess that is

1440
01:48:13,889 --> 01:48:16,763
are very few places that are difficult
can go in this world...

1441
01:48:17,087 --> 01:48:19,470
...but there are others
be more difficult to live.

1442
01:48:20,897 --> 01:48:25,767
The average temperature here in the bottom
of the earth is about 50 degrees below.

1443
01:48:25,856 --> 01:48:26,893
With strawberry.

1444
01:48:27,793 --> 01:48:28,854
one scoop mocha chip.

1445
01:48:29,348 --> 01:48:30,191
Great.

1446
01:48:31,357 --> 01:48:33,594
Antarctica used to be tropical place.

1447
01:48:33,900 --> 01:48:36,337
With dense forests and bustling.

1448
01:48:37,367 --> 01:48:39,883
But then the continents
began to move south.

1449
01:48:40,401 --> 01:48:45,380
And to finish the move forests
were replaced by a new territory.

1450
01:48:45,415 --> 01:48:45,952
Ice

1451
01:48:51,014 --> 01:48:55,309
As for the old residents, all
died or moved long ago.

1452
01:48:55,808 --> 01:48:58,277
Basically, almost all of them.

1453
01:49:01,370 --> 01:49:03,879
The royal penguin
is essentially a bird.

1454
01:49:04,686 --> 01:49:06,924
Only he makes
the home of the sea.

1455
01:49:08,246 --> 01:49:11,529
And if you wonder what
done here on the ice, then...

1456
01:49:12,200 --> 01:49:13,748
This is another story.

1457
01:49:14,429 --> 01:49:16,863
is here around the same time

1458
01:49:16,898 --> 01:49:21,173
who wants to leave the ocean's house
and begin a memorable trip.

1459
01:49:21,565 --> 01:49:23,793
They traveled a long distance...
