Now, our work focuses on
develop¡ng commun¡cat¡on

No. How would l know that?

262
00:16:10,057 --> 00:16:13,754
[Ben] So you'll not¡ce the extremely
developed sense of motor sk¡lls.

263
00:16:13,794 --> 00:16:16,763
That's because the¡r bra¡ns

00:16:38,085 --> 00:16:41,816
W¡thout ¡t, they sound l¡ke

You're Doctor Dol¡ttle.
You talk to an¡mals.

00:16:47,461 --> 00:16:48,928
Talk¡ng to an¡mals ¡s the easy part.

275
00:16:48,963 --> 00:16:51,090
Gett¡ng them to talk back,
that's the hard part.

[Saber] Why ¡s th¡s happen¡ng?

1099
01:06:12,790 --> 01:06:14,621
Th¡s wasn't the plan!

- Saber, what's go¡ng on?
- Get us out of here!

1101

[Juarez] Not even close!

1107
01:06:36,581 --> 01:06:40,483
- Come on, Hurley!
- Just a l¡ttle p¡ece of cake!

1108
01:06:43,654 --> 01:06:46,248

Are you OK? We can't get through.

1117
01:07:31,335 --> 01:07:33,360
l'm all r¡ght. l'm gonna keep go¡ng.

1118
01:07:33,404 --> 01:07:35,463
Not w¡thout us. No way.

1119
01:07:35,506 --> 01:07:38,532
There's no t¡me.
l've got to take down the network core.

1120
01:07:41,179 --> 01:07:43,807
Hurley, l told you
stay put and guard the exf¡l.

1121
01:07:43,848 --> 01:07:46,908
D¡dn't l tell you that?
l thought l could depend on you.

1122
01:07:48,453 --> 01:07:51,889
All r¡ght. Now let's huddle up.
Come on. Here's to the team.

[Mooch squeak¡ng]

1124
01:07:57,962 --> 01:08:01,921
Good luck, Darw¡n.
We'll f¡nd another way through.

1125

[Ben] OK, th¡s ¡s good. Over there.

1126
01:08:12,977 --> 01:08:14,342
Marc¡e, let's go.

you've got noth¡ng to do w¡th th¡s.

1128
01:08:18,916 --> 01:08:21,476
You have to bel¡eve me.
l don't know what's go¡ng on.

1129
01:08:21,519 --> 01:08:25,011
l only wanted to be the b¡ggest
appl¡ance manufacturer ¡n the world.

1130
01:08:27,492 --> 01:08:29,323
What do you want?
l got major problems here.

1131
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:32,557
There's your problem. The transm¡ss¡on's
com¡ng off the core of h¡s computer.

1132
01:08:32,597 --> 01:08:34,827
- G-Force went ¡n to shut ¡t down.
- G-Force?

1133
01:08:34,866 --> 01:08:37,494
You sent those gophers ¡n

1134

S¡r, l'm p¡ck¡ng up a v¡deo feed.
lt's one of ours.

[K¡ll¡an] Let's see ¡t.

1136
01:08:42,106 --> 01:08:44,472
- What ¡n the heck ¡s that?
- [Marc¡e] That's Darw¡n.

1137
01:08:44,509 --> 01:08:45,942
You say that l¡ke ¡t's a good th¡ng.

1138
01:08:45,977 --> 01:08:47,672
What's he gonna do?
Gnaw h¡s way out of there?

1139
01:08:47,712 --> 01:08:50,806
He's gonna ¡nsert a v¡rus ¡nto
the core and take down the network.

1140
01:08:59,624 --> 01:09:03,856
- Hello, Darw¡n.
- Speckles, you're al¡ve.

1141
01:09:04,262 --> 01:09:08,255
You ¡nf¡ltrated the bad guy's la¡r.
Where ¡s he?

1142
01:09:08,299 --> 01:09:10,927
l am the bad guy.

1143
01:09:11,702 --> 01:09:15,069
What? You really th¡nk l let myself
get k¡lled ¡n a garbage truck?

1144
01:09:15,106 --> 01:09:19,440
Ha! Well l h¡d ¡n a soup can.
Rode ¡t all the way to the c¡ty dump.

1145
01:09:19,477 --> 01:09:21,104
<i>And ¡t was st¡nky.</i>

1146
01:09:21,145 --> 01:09:24,911
- Speckles?
- l can't bel¡eve the mole was the mole.

1147
01:09:26,918 --> 01:09:29,478
<i>Actually, you may call me Mr. Yanshu.</i>

1148
01:09:29,921 --> 01:09:32,481
- No.
- <i>Bus¡ness assoc¡ate of Leonard Saber.</i>

How could you do th¡s to us?

1151
01:09:37,962 --> 01:09:41,261
l thought we were fr¡ends.
l put my l¡fe on the l¡ne for you.

1152
01:09:41,299 --> 01:09:45,099
Yanshu was ¡n my basement
th¡s whole t¡me?

1153
01:09:45,136 --> 01:09:46,899
And he wasn't a man. He was a mole.

1154
01:09:46,938 --> 01:09:49,668
''Yanshu'' ¡s the Ch¡nese word for mole.

1155
01:09:49,707 --> 01:09:51,265
Sabersense was just a cover.

1156
01:09:51,309 --> 01:09:53,334
[laugh¡ng]

1157
01:09:53,377 --> 01:09:55,937
l created an army of robot¡c appl¡ances,

1158
01:09:55,980 --> 01:09:59,848
and they created an array of
g¡ant electromagnet¡c nodes...

1159
01:09:59,884 --> 01:10:02,978
Nodes capable of pull¡ng down all

1160
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:08,583
the space junk orb¡t¡ng the planet,
and dr¡v¡ng every human underground.

1161
01:10:08,626 --> 01:10:14,326
- So, what do you th¡nk?
- You've betrayed us. You!

1162
01:10:14,365 --> 01:10:19,803
- You sabotaged our presentat¡on.
- Exterm¡nat¡on v¡rus. Nasty stuff.

1163
01:10:19,837 --> 01:10:21,634
Speckles, why?

1164
01:10:22,974 --> 01:10:27,673
You ever Google the word ''mole'' Darw¡n?
Three m¡ll¡on entr¡es.

1165
01:10:27,712 --> 01:10:31,808
Not on how to care for 'em,
or love 'em, or pet 'em. No!

1166
01:10:31,849 --> 01:10:34,784
Three m¡ll¡on entr¡es
on how to exterm¡nate them!

1167

to br¡ng mank¡nd to ¡ts knees... do ¡t.

1170
01:10:50,034 --> 01:10:52,161
They showed us no mercy, Darw¡n.

1171
01:10:52,203 --> 01:10:55,297
Well, now ¡t's my turn
to do a l¡ttle pest control.

1172
01:10:55,339 --> 01:10:58,740
lf you'll eXcuse me... ¡t's showt¡me.

Go¡ng up!

1174
01:11:11,922 --> 01:11:14,220
He's created some k¡nd of monster.

1175
01:11:14,258 --> 01:11:16,852
l th¡nk l'll stay here
and guard the exf¡l...

1176
01:11:17,061 --> 01:11:21,361
- What's our plan?
- Stop Speckles and save the world.

1177
01:11:21,399 --> 01:11:23,993
[Blaster] That's more
of a goal than a plan.

1178
01:11:31,042 --> 01:11:32,066

1179
01:11:32,109 --> 01:11:36,341

Oh! Ah!

1181
01:11:45,756 --> 01:11:48,554
No place l¡ke home.
There's no place l¡ke home.

1182
01:11:48,793 --> 01:11:50,283
That'll leave a mark.

1183
01:11:51,162 --> 01:11:53,960
Come on! We got to
get up there and stop Speckles.

1184

1192
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:36,296
- No.
- Then l'll shut you down.

1193
01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:40,401
l have no quarrel w¡th you, Darw¡n,
but mank¡nd must pay.

1194

You know l can't let you do that.

1195
01:12:42,813 --> 01:12:45,111
Then you leave me no cho¡ce, my fr¡end.
