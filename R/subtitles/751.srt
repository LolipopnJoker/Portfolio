1
00:00:18,771 --> 00:00:24,741
¶ Ooh ooh ooh ¶

2
00:00:24,743 --> 00:00:26,743
¶ heaven is my home ¶

3
00:00:26,745 --> 00:00:28,044
¶ ooh ooh ¶

4
00:00:28,046 --> 00:00:30,246
¶ heaven is my home ¶

5
00:00:30,248 --> 00:00:31,780
¶ ooh ooh ooh ¶

6
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:35,383
¶ now this sweet world
is precious to me ¶

7
00:00:35,385 --> 00:00:37,318
¶ ooh ¶

8
00:00:48,163 --> 00:00:52,564
¶ I have traveled
down this road before ¶

9
00:00:52,566 --> 00:00:56,401
¶ on a journey for a friend ¶

10
00:00:56,403 --> 00:01:00,837
¶ been away,
but now I'm back for more ¶

11
00:01:00,839 --> 00:01:03,205
¶ going down this road again ¶

12
00:01:05,108 --> 00:01:08,976
¶ you know
he answers every prayer ¶

13
00:01:08,978 --> 00:01:13,246
¶ but you better do your part ¶

14
00:01:13,248 --> 00:01:17,116
¶ his spirit's
all around you everywhere ¶

15
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,985
¶ but you gotta open up
your heart ¶

16
00:01:21,221 --> 00:01:24,355
¶ you've gotta open up
your heart ¶

17
00:01:31,063 --> 00:01:36,132
¶ you're alone when
you come in this world ¶

18
00:01:36,134 --> 00:01:39,135
¶ you're alone when you go ¶

19
00:01:39,137 --> 00:01:44,273
¶ and it doesn't matter
who you are ¶

20
00:01:44,275 --> 00:01:48,143
¶ doesn't matter who you know ¶

21
00:01:48,145 --> 00:01:53,114
¶ keep on listening
for that choir, boys ¶

22
00:01:53,116 --> 00:01:55,116
¶ that's the way to start ¶

23
00:01:56,853 --> 00:02:00,754
¶ the door is open,
but you have a choice ¶

24
00:02:00,756 --> 00:02:03,422
¶ you've got to open up
your heart ¶

25
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:07,559
¶ you've gotta open up
your heart ¶

26
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:17,334
¶ oh, this world
is dear to me ¶

27
00:02:18,103 --> 00:02:20,903
¶ heaven is my home ¶

28
00:02:22,339 --> 00:02:26,107
¶ this is where I long to be ¶

29
00:02:27,176 --> 00:02:29,542
¶ heaven is my home ¶

30
00:02:31,078 --> 00:02:33,978
¶ when your life seems gloomy ¶

31
00:02:35,581 --> 00:02:38,448
¶ teardrops start to fall ¶

32
00:02:39,851 --> 00:02:43,585
¶ send the word back to me ¶

33
00:02:43,587 --> 00:02:45,920
¶ that I'll be there ¶

34
00:02:45,922 --> 00:02:48,455
¶ when you call ¶

35
00:02:48,457 --> 00:02:53,092
¶ I've been down
this road before ¶

36
00:02:53,094 --> 00:02:55,927
¶ heaven is my home ¶

37
00:02:57,497 --> 00:02:59,530
¶ not coming back here ¶

38
00:02:59,532 --> 00:03:00,998
¶ anymore ¶

39
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,667
¶ heaven is my home ¶

40
00:03:04,669 --> 00:03:06,168
¶ yeah ¶

41
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:09,471
¶ heaven is my home ¶

42
00:03:36,698 --> 00:03:37,697
Good night now.

43
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:39,098
Good night.

44
00:04:18,838 --> 00:04:21,004
¶ Sleigh bells ring ¶

45
00:04:21,006 --> 00:04:23,106
¶ are you listening? ¶

46
00:04:23,108 --> 00:04:25,007
¶ in the land ¶

47
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:27,509
¶ snow is glistening ¶

48
00:04:27,511 --> 00:04:29,143
¶ a beautiful sight ¶

49
00:04:29,145 --> 00:04:31,245
¶ we're happy tonight ¶

50
00:04:31,247 --> 00:04:34,047
¶ walking in
a winter wonderland... ¶

51
00:04:34,049 --> 00:04:35,648
Right here is fine.

52
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,416
Think this is bleak enough?

53
00:04:37,418 --> 00:04:41,085
My ears are frozen,
my feet are frozen.

54
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,886
This is as far as it goes.

55
00:04:42,888 --> 00:04:45,321
Malt's not going to like this.

56
00:04:45,323 --> 00:04:47,089
What's he not going to like?

57
00:04:47,091 --> 00:04:48,890
He'll find something not to like.

58
00:04:48,892 --> 00:04:50,358
Besides us, you mean?

59
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,226
Yes, besides us.

60
00:04:52,228 --> 00:04:53,727
Huey...

61
00:04:53,729 --> 00:04:55,028
You sit in the sled.

62
00:04:58,533 --> 00:05:01,901
Santa, Sparky, presents...

63
00:05:01,903 --> 00:05:03,068
Reindeer...

64
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,370
Fake snow...
What are we missing?

65
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:06,371
Children.

66
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:08,439
Oh, yeah.

67
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:09,673
Let them out!

68
00:05:09,675 --> 00:05:11,507
Let them out!

69
00:05:16,747 --> 00:05:17,946
Now what do I do?

70
00:05:17,948 --> 00:05:20,114
You know what to do.

71
00:05:20,116 --> 00:05:23,650
When they handed out the parts,
you got the heart.

72
00:05:23,652 --> 00:05:25,318
That's right, I got the heart.

73
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,320
You got the brain.
Is that what you're saying?

74
00:05:27,322 --> 00:05:31,290
I'm saying that between the two of us,
you've got the heart.

75
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:34,760
I'm saying that together,
we make a person.

76
00:05:34,762 --> 00:05:35,861
It's Santa!

77
00:05:35,863 --> 00:05:37,462
It's Sparky!

78
00:05:38,264 --> 00:05:39,663
¶ And we're walking ¶

79
00:05:40,832 --> 00:05:42,064
¶ In a winter ¶

80
00:05:42,066 --> 00:05:47,235
¶ wonderla-a-and ¶

81
00:05:50,473 --> 00:05:53,207
What is this, Craddock, a joke?

82
00:05:53,209 --> 00:05:54,007
No.

83
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:56,009
Who was in charge here?

84
00:05:56,011 --> 00:05:57,343
Me. I was.

85
00:05:57,345 --> 00:05:58,944
That's right, mr. Malt.
This was Quinlan's baby.

86
00:05:58,946 --> 00:06:00,679
Quinlan...

87
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:01,980
Let me ask you a question.

88
00:06:01,982 --> 00:06:05,316
You was a big-shot
investigative reporter

89
00:06:05,318 --> 00:06:06,817
for the<i> Chicago Tribune.</i>

90
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:08,451
Won some prizes.

91
00:06:11,722 --> 00:06:12,854
Give him a biscuit.

92
00:06:12,856 --> 00:06:16,357
Now, what do these
look like to you?

93
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:18,525
They're Indians dressed up as eskimos.

94
00:06:18,527 --> 00:06:21,261
Indians, eskimos...
What's the difference?

95
00:06:21,263 --> 00:06:22,528
That's what we thought.

96
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,429
Shut up, Driscoll.

97
00:06:24,431 --> 00:06:26,931
You know the only prize
I ever got, Quinlan?

98
00:06:26,933 --> 00:06:29,099
It's out there on the walls.

99
00:06:29,101 --> 00:06:32,602
I got 4.5 million people

100
00:06:32,604 --> 00:06:35,237
who buy the<i> National Mirror</i> every week.

101
00:06:35,239 --> 00:06:38,974
Do you know how many of
those 4 1/2 million readers

102
00:06:38,976 --> 00:06:41,876
are Indians or eskimos
or eskimo-Indians?

103
00:06:41,878 --> 00:06:43,644
I told him. American children.

104
00:06:43,646 --> 00:06:47,114
Americans want to see
pictures of Americans.

105
00:06:47,116 --> 00:06:48,648
They are Americans.

106
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:52,485
Americans! Is that too much
to ask for Christmas?

107
00:06:52,487 --> 00:06:57,255
No, sir, and I will
get someone right on it.

108
00:06:57,257 --> 00:06:59,490
Aw, did you do that again?

109
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,095
If you don't teach
that dog some manners soon,

110
00:07:05,097 --> 00:07:07,197
somebody else
is going to have to,

111
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,765
won't they, hmm?

112
00:07:08,767 --> 00:07:11,400
How long were you in
Elizabeth Taylor's pool, ma'am?

113
00:07:11,402 --> 00:07:14,403
Reincarnation.
Miss Uffler speaking.

114
00:07:14,405 --> 00:07:16,838
Were you on the bed
when it levitated?

115
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,607
So you're saying
he's living in your refrigerator?

116
00:07:19,609 --> 00:07:21,241
Uh-huh.

117
00:07:21,243 --> 00:07:22,976
Uh-huh.
You know what?

118
00:07:22,978 --> 00:07:24,911
Can I put you on
hold for a second?

119
00:07:24,913 --> 00:07:27,813
I'm going to go to my desk
and take this call there.

120
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:29,014
Yes. Now, don't let him out.

121
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:30,682
Ok. Hold on.

122
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,033
Oh.

123
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:50,434
Oh, no, no, no.

124
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:52,535
Here's something interesting.

125
00:07:55,106 --> 00:07:57,239
Ay yi yi.

126
00:08:01,211 --> 00:08:05,312
Malt sent you for the tree this year,
didn't he? I forgot.

127
00:08:05,314 --> 00:08:06,913
I found it in Montana.

128
00:08:06,915 --> 00:08:08,714
Now, the second
I see this tree,

129
00:08:08,716 --> 00:08:11,683
I know that it's too big
to fit on the truck.

130
00:08:11,685 --> 00:08:14,152
Then I think, what if someone else
sees the same tree

131
00:08:14,154 --> 00:08:16,120
while I'm out trying
to find something

132
00:08:16,122 --> 00:08:18,689
that will fit on the truck?

133
00:08:18,691 --> 00:08:19,923
Then Malt...

134
00:08:19,925 --> 00:08:23,559
Gets the second biggest
Christmas tree in America,

135
00:08:23,561 --> 00:08:24,993
and I'm screwed.

136
00:08:24,995 --> 00:08:26,861
Yeah, well, that's good thinking.

137
00:08:26,863 --> 00:08:28,662
So I cut the top off.

138
00:08:28,664 --> 00:08:30,163
You did that?

139
00:08:30,165 --> 00:08:32,598
How was I supposed to know
it was going to be such a major problem

140
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,967
to put the top part of the tree
back on the bottom?

141
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:37,069
He is never going
to fire you, Huey.

142
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:41,206
Look at the walls.
Look, look at the walls.

143
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:44,342
He's got millions of dollars
tied up in that dog,

144
00:08:44,344 --> 00:08:47,345
and the dog belongs to you.

145
00:08:47,347 --> 00:08:49,780
Hold on to that dog, Huey.

146
00:08:57,456 --> 00:08:58,421
What?

147
00:08:58,423 --> 00:09:00,489
Driscoll?
Driscoll!

148
00:09:00,491 --> 00:09:03,224
Driscoll!
Come in here!

149
00:09:05,595 --> 00:09:07,595
We're going together, Sparky.

150
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:14,434
"Dear mr. Quinlan, I'm a great
admirer of your... prose

151
00:09:14,436 --> 00:09:17,069
"and can tell you have
a sensitive nature.

152
00:09:17,071 --> 00:09:23,474
"I have had an angel
named... Michael...

153
00:09:23,476 --> 00:09:26,210
"Living with me for almost 6 months now.

154
00:09:26,212 --> 00:09:28,478
"He's extremely polite.

155
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,180
"I have enclosed a photograph to prove to you

156
00:09:31,182 --> 00:09:34,750
"that I have not lost my wits.

157
00:09:34,752 --> 00:09:37,619
"I know that you and Sparky travel all over

158
00:09:37,621 --> 00:09:39,087
"reporting on your stories.

159
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:41,489
"That one about the coconut
with the wedding ring inside

160
00:09:41,491 --> 00:09:44,625
"was very, very nice,

161
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:47,560
and I think you should visit Iowa..."

162
00:09:49,931 --> 00:09:52,898
"And see us for yourself.

163
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,601
Sincerely, Pansy Milbank."

164
00:09:58,237 --> 00:09:59,970
Mm-hmm.

165
00:09:59,972 --> 00:10:01,638
Yeah.

166
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,240
Did your mother drop you?

167
00:10:04,242 --> 00:10:07,910
What was going on
in that pea brain

168
00:10:07,912 --> 00:10:12,880
that lets you take this superb creation
of the lord almighty

169
00:10:12,882 --> 00:10:14,815
and chop it in half?!

170
00:10:14,817 --> 00:10:17,184
Whatever I'm paying you,
it's too much!

171
00:10:17,186 --> 00:10:18,618
How much does Fred make?

172
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,553
What, the janitor?
Oh, mr. Malt,

173
00:10:20,555 --> 00:10:23,255
I cannot survive on a janitor's salary...

174
00:10:23,257 --> 00:10:24,589
Kill the dog.

175
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:25,957
Quinlan, did someone
invite you to this meeting?

176
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,059
Take him outside
and let him go on the highway.

177
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:29,060
Wait a minute...

178
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:30,394
what kind of person are you?

179
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:31,762
Who is this?

180
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:34,064
This is miss Dorothy Winters.
She works here.

181
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,698
I do?
I got the job?

182
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,267
Yes! You won't regret this, mr. Malt.

183
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:42,771
Do you know what that is?

184
00:10:42,773 --> 00:10:47,008
That is an angel.

185
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,143
That is a genuine angel.

186
00:10:49,145 --> 00:10:52,179
Huey discovered it.

187
00:10:52,181 --> 00:10:53,780
Is this for real?

188
00:10:53,782 --> 00:10:55,548
Absolutely.

189
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,716
You're going to go
get me this angel.

190
00:10:57,718 --> 00:11:01,086
That's exactly
what we're going to do.

191
00:11:02,255 --> 00:11:04,555
We'll put it on the front page, bold.

192
00:11:04,557 --> 00:11:06,156
Some white fluffy clouds...

193
00:11:06,158 --> 00:11:08,191
There you go.

194
00:11:08,193 --> 00:11:09,792
A drift of sky...

195
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,026
You got it.

196
00:11:11,028 --> 00:11:12,427
And some musical notes!

197
00:11:12,429 --> 00:11:13,628
Yeah. Yeah.

198
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,629
Yeah!

199
00:11:14,631 --> 00:11:15,429
Poetry.

200
00:11:15,431 --> 00:11:17,097
Don't play with me, Quinlan.

201
00:11:17,099 --> 00:11:21,768
You really are going to go
and fetch me this angel for Christmas,

202
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:25,338
or... I fire the two of you,

203
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:28,907
and I keep the dog. Yeah?

204
00:11:28,909 --> 00:11:29,874
Deal.

205
00:11:29,876 --> 00:11:32,176
A little conference with my colleague.

206
00:11:32,178 --> 00:11:34,311
You cannot live on Fred's salary.

207
00:11:34,313 --> 00:11:35,312
You cannot.

208
00:11:35,314 --> 00:11:36,680
That's a deal.

209
00:11:36,682 --> 00:11:39,482
Don't you worry about a thing, mr. Malt.

210
00:11:39,484 --> 00:11:41,550
We'll leave tomorrow.

211
00:11:41,552 --> 00:11:44,586
We're taking Sparky with us.

212
00:11:44,588 --> 00:11:46,354
And you're taking miss Winters.

213
00:11:46,356 --> 00:11:47,421
They are?

214
00:11:47,423 --> 00:11:48,855
Why are we taking her?

215
00:11:48,857 --> 00:11:49,889
She's an expert.

216
00:11:49,891 --> 00:11:50,890
In what?

217
00:11:50,892 --> 00:11:52,658
Angels.

218
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:56,194
Miss Winters is
an expert in angels.

219
00:11:58,264 --> 00:12:01,231
I have something to tell you.

220
00:12:01,233 --> 00:12:03,032
I won't be taking care of you anymore.

221
00:12:03,034 --> 00:12:06,468
Your parents will find
someone else and...

222
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,269
Stop looking at me like that.

223
00:12:09,305 --> 00:12:10,904
I have this wonderful new job.

224
00:12:10,906 --> 00:12:13,706
The only problem is, I have to pretend
to be an angel expert

225
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,841
for a few days on this trip.

226
00:12:15,843 --> 00:12:17,943
It'll be fine.

227
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:20,278
I'll be fine.

228
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,213
And so will you.

229
00:12:22,215 --> 00:12:24,215
Good dogs.

230
00:12:24,217 --> 00:12:25,883
Good dogs.

231
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:22,200
Have you ever had
an encounter with an angel?

232
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:23,201
No.

233
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:24,402
Yes.

234
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:25,403
Maybe.

235
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:26,971
Have you ever met an angel?

236
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,205
Yeah, once.

237
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:29,639
I got a flat tire

238
00:13:29,641 --> 00:13:31,474
on the side of a deserted country road.

239
00:13:31,476 --> 00:13:33,042
There was no food, no water,

240
00:13:33,044 --> 00:13:34,376
108 degrees temperature,

241
00:13:34,378 --> 00:13:37,278
and a man in a white robe

242
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,746
suddenly appeared
on the horizon

243
00:13:38,748 --> 00:13:41,281
with a spare and a jack.

244
00:13:41,283 --> 00:13:42,415
You're kidding.

245
00:13:42,417 --> 00:13:43,983
Yes, I am.

246
00:13:43,985 --> 00:13:45,851
Bradley used to tease.

247
00:13:45,853 --> 00:13:47,352
Who is Bradley?

248
00:13:47,354 --> 00:13:49,020
My ex-husband.

249
00:13:49,022 --> 00:13:52,656
Oh, ho.
You better watch it, Quinlan.

250
00:13:52,658 --> 00:13:54,357
I think we should start over.

251
00:13:54,359 --> 00:13:55,691
You know, when something
isn't going well,

252
00:13:55,693 --> 00:13:57,292
it's best just to start over.

253
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,359
I'll go first.

254
00:13:58,361 --> 00:13:59,360
Ok.

255
00:13:59,362 --> 00:14:00,794
Where'd you get Sparky?

256
00:14:00,796 --> 00:14:01,928
Oh, no.

257
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:04,330
He comes up to Huey
in a parking lot one day.

258
00:14:04,332 --> 00:14:05,831
Huey was eating a donut,

259
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:08,333
and he's trying to kick the...
trying to kick him away.

260
00:14:08,335 --> 00:14:10,868
You were trying
to kick the dog?

261
00:14:12,371 --> 00:14:13,703
I wasn't trying to kick him.

262
00:14:13,705 --> 00:14:16,772
I was trying to shoo
him away very gently.

263
00:14:16,774 --> 00:14:20,375
When Malt comes out the door,
he looks at the dog,

264
00:14:20,377 --> 00:14:21,609
he stops dead in his tracks.

265
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,911
It turns out that Malt
was once a child

266
00:14:23,913 --> 00:14:26,313
who had had a dog
just like that one.

267
00:14:26,315 --> 00:14:29,516
Oh, that's so sweet.

268
00:14:29,518 --> 00:14:32,385
Anyway, Malt's eyes get all teary,

269
00:14:32,387 --> 00:14:35,988
and he pours out this story
all about his dog Sparky,

270
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:39,524
which ended up underneath a tractor tire!

271
00:14:39,526 --> 00:14:41,225
Ha ha ha!

272
00:14:41,227 --> 00:14:42,926
And you know what Huey did?

273
00:14:42,928 --> 00:14:44,193
Huey turns to Malt,
and he says,

274
00:14:44,195 --> 00:14:46,295
"Mr. Malt, that is amazing!

275
00:14:46,297 --> 00:14:48,930
This dog's name is Sparky, too!"

276
00:14:48,932 --> 00:14:51,399
Ha ha ha!

277
00:14:51,401 --> 00:14:54,602
In no time at all,
the dog is famous.

278
00:14:54,604 --> 00:14:55,936
He's got his own column.

279
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:58,038
He must've saved Huey's neck
a hundred times.

280
00:14:58,807 --> 00:15:00,940
Milk bottle hotel.
Here, here, here!

281
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:01,941
Milk bottle hotel!

282
00:16:17,682 --> 00:16:20,049
Looks like your angel checked out.

283
00:16:25,088 --> 00:16:26,687
Somebody's here.

284
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:42,299
Mrs. Milbank?

285
00:16:44,836 --> 00:16:47,036
Mrs. Milbank,
I'm Frank Quinlan

286
00:16:47,038 --> 00:16:50,205
from the<i> National Mirror.</i>

287
00:16:50,207 --> 00:16:52,907
About your letter?

288
00:16:52,909 --> 00:16:53,874
Um...

289
00:16:53,876 --> 00:16:57,010
This is my associate mr. Hugh Driscoll.

290
00:16:57,012 --> 00:16:58,277
H-how are you?

291
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:00,445
And this is Dorothy Winters,

292
00:17:00,447 --> 00:17:04,248
who is an expert in... various things.

293
00:17:05,517 --> 00:17:07,049
And this is...

294
00:17:07,051 --> 00:17:08,183
Sparky.

295
00:17:10,053 --> 00:17:12,853
Oh! Oh!

296
00:17:12,855 --> 00:17:18,557
Oh, you're just as handsome
as in the pictures!

297
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:19,558
Aww...

298
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,493
Oh, I think he's cold.

299
00:17:21,495 --> 00:17:22,560
I wouldn't know why not.

300
00:17:22,562 --> 00:17:25,829
We better get him inside.
Oh...

301
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:34,102
Sparky, here you are.

302
00:17:34,104 --> 00:17:35,803
Oh, ha ha!

303
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:38,972
Mmm. What's that
wonderful smell?

304
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,840
You must be baking.

305
00:17:47,013 --> 00:17:49,580
Well, it was nice
of you to come.

306
00:18:07,365 --> 00:18:09,131
Ohh!

307
00:18:10,467 --> 00:18:12,033
Mrs. Milbank?

308
00:18:14,871 --> 00:18:17,605
Don't shake me, mr. Quinlan!

309
00:18:17,607 --> 00:18:20,074
I'm contemplating my death.

310
00:18:20,076 --> 00:18:22,843
Are you with the angel?

311
00:18:27,882 --> 00:18:30,215
Do you see an angel?

312
00:18:31,585 --> 00:18:33,017
I don't think I do.

313
00:18:33,019 --> 00:18:35,319
Then how could I be with him?

314
00:18:35,321 --> 00:18:40,223
Well, we don't know exactly
how it works with angels.

315
00:18:40,225 --> 00:18:41,490
"How it works"?

316
00:18:43,227 --> 00:18:46,728
If he's in the room,
then you're with him.

317
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,329
If he's somewhere else,

318
00:18:48,331 --> 00:18:49,763
then you're not.

319
00:18:49,765 --> 00:18:52,732
And that's why we
can't see him now.

320
00:18:52,734 --> 00:18:54,600
He's not here.

321
00:18:54,602 --> 00:18:59,904
Are you impaired in some way
that I haven't noticed, miss?

322
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:02,206
Miss Winters has
probably never heard

323
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,875
of an angel living in a motel.

324
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,643
Ha ha ha!

325
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,578
You think I'm full of shit.

326
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,446
No, no, nothing like that.

327
00:19:10,448 --> 00:19:12,981
I don't judge these things, mrs. Milbank.

328
00:19:12,983 --> 00:19:15,416
It's not for me to decide
what's real and what's not.

329
00:19:15,418 --> 00:19:17,384
I've seen too many things myself.

330
00:19:17,386 --> 00:19:21,320
We once heard there was
a werewolf in South Jersey.

331
00:19:21,322 --> 00:19:22,487
We went there.

332
00:19:22,489 --> 00:19:23,788
To locate the, uh, werewolf.

333
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:26,323
Yeah. In that particular case,

334
00:19:26,325 --> 00:19:28,124
that person was...

335
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:31,660
Utterly convinced that the werewolf
was in the room with us.

336
00:19:31,662 --> 00:19:34,763
They could see it, although
mr. Quinlan and myself...

337
00:19:34,765 --> 00:19:36,064
We couldn't see the werewolf,

338
00:19:36,066 --> 00:19:38,266
but that doesn't mean
it wasn't there.

339
00:19:38,268 --> 00:19:39,900
Michael!

340
00:19:39,902 --> 00:19:44,838
Michael? Are you coming down, dear?

341
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,273
Yeah...

342
00:19:47,275 --> 00:19:49,074
Be right down.

343
00:19:49,076 --> 00:19:51,076
Just gotta find my smokes.

344
00:19:51,078 --> 00:19:54,946
They're beside the bed,
next to my cortisone.

345
00:19:54,948 --> 00:19:57,415
Did you find them?

346
00:19:57,417 --> 00:20:00,151
He'll be down directly.

347
00:20:01,654 --> 00:20:03,553
That smell is so familiar.

348
00:20:04,689 --> 00:20:06,422
It's like something
from childhood.

349
00:20:33,114 --> 00:20:34,480
Ohh...

350
00:20:46,493 --> 00:20:49,227
Michael, look who's come to visit us.

351
00:20:49,229 --> 00:20:50,661
It's Sparky.

352
00:21:05,043 --> 00:21:07,043
How do you do?

353
00:21:25,095 --> 00:21:28,129
You'll have to excuse Michael.

354
00:21:28,131 --> 00:21:30,464
He's not good at suffering fools,

355
00:21:30,466 --> 00:21:33,667
but he'll be better in the morning.

356
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:58,056
It's freezing!

357
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,659
Whoa!

358
00:22:03,929 --> 00:22:06,095
Where is the thermostat in here?

359
00:22:06,097 --> 00:22:08,063
Are we talking
about an angel here?

360
00:22:08,065 --> 00:22:09,964
We can't be talking
about an angel.

361
00:22:09,966 --> 00:22:11,365
There is no...

362
00:22:11,367 --> 00:22:13,467
Such thing such thing as an angel.
As an angel.

363
00:22:13,469 --> 00:22:16,069
That is definitely the weirdest thing
I have ever seen.

364
00:22:16,071 --> 00:22:17,937
It's like some great big bird

365
00:22:17,939 --> 00:22:19,305
made love to that guy's mother.

366
00:22:19,307 --> 00:22:22,708
Yes! And we... we reap the benefits!

367
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,109
I'm set for life!

368
00:22:24,111 --> 00:22:25,810
I mean, I could even get a raise!

369
00:22:25,812 --> 00:22:27,912
I thank you!
Thank you, Jesus!

370
00:22:27,914 --> 00:22:29,079
¶ Thank you, Jesus ¶

371
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:30,213
¶ I thank you, Jesus ¶

372
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:32,248
¶ I thank you, Jesus ¶

373
00:22:32,917 --> 00:22:35,951
¶ thank you, Jesus,
thank you, Jesus, I thank you, Jesus ¶

374
00:22:35,953 --> 00:22:39,587
¶ I thank you, jes... ¶

375
00:22:39,589 --> 00:22:40,721
What?

376
00:22:40,723 --> 00:22:42,422
That is not an angel.

377
00:22:42,424 --> 00:22:43,890
It is too!

378
00:22:43,892 --> 00:22:45,358
It is not!

379
00:22:47,662 --> 00:22:49,361
I will handle this.

380
00:22:51,531 --> 00:22:53,531
Where... has he been?

381
00:22:53,533 --> 00:22:54,465
Meaning what?

382
00:22:54,467 --> 00:22:57,000
Meaning if he were
a man with wings,

383
00:22:57,002 --> 00:22:58,835
which is the alternative here,

384
00:22:58,837 --> 00:23:00,102
we would've heard about him.

385
00:23:00,104 --> 00:23:01,803
He didn't just show up
at his age with wings.

386
00:23:01,805 --> 00:23:04,739
There would've been a story
about him in the papers.

387
00:23:04,741 --> 00:23:05,840
In the<i> National Mirror.</i>

388
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:08,275
Exactly. "Baby born with wings."

389
00:23:08,277 --> 00:23:10,310
Yeah, "Birdman of Iowa."

390
00:23:10,312 --> 00:23:12,712
It is not angel vs. man with wings.

391
00:23:12,714 --> 00:23:14,580
There are other possibilities.

392
00:23:14,582 --> 00:23:16,214
Like what?

393
00:23:16,216 --> 00:23:19,917
It's fairly obvious, isn't it?

394
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,719
He's a younger man.
She's an older woman.

395
00:23:22,721 --> 00:23:24,153
He's after her money.

396
00:23:24,155 --> 00:23:26,855
A gigolo with wings?

397
00:23:26,857 --> 00:23:27,856
A gigolo!

398
00:23:27,858 --> 00:23:29,424
What money is he after?

399
00:23:29,426 --> 00:23:32,126
The milk bottle motel fortune?

400
00:23:32,128 --> 00:23:33,560
You don't have to have money

401
00:23:33,562 --> 00:23:36,729
to have someone try
to take it away from you.

402
00:23:36,731 --> 00:23:39,098
Lord! Oh...

403
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,666
Is it so hard for you to imagine

404
00:23:40,668 --> 00:23:44,068
that a man would be
after a woman's money?

405
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,602
Is this, uh,

406
00:23:45,604 --> 00:23:47,604
is this Britely or Brinkley
or whatever, what's his name?

407
00:23:47,606 --> 00:23:48,638
Bradley.

408
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,239
Is this Bradley we're
talking about here?

409
00:23:50,241 --> 00:23:51,640
Actually, no.
It's Myles.

410
00:23:51,642 --> 00:23:52,674
Who's Myles?

411
00:23:52,676 --> 00:23:53,875
My second husband.

412
00:23:53,877 --> 00:23:54,876
Ah.

413
00:23:54,878 --> 00:23:56,744
Myles was a wild man.

414
00:23:56,746 --> 00:23:57,945
It only lasted a week.

415
00:23:57,947 --> 00:23:59,246
You left him?

416
00:23:59,248 --> 00:24:01,848
No. He left me in my Camaro.

417
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:04,383
Ahh!

418
00:24:04,385 --> 00:24:05,784
I see.

419
00:24:05,786 --> 00:24:07,552
I'll bet he racked up $5,000

420
00:24:07,554 --> 00:24:09,353
on your visa bill, too, didn't he?

421
00:24:09,355 --> 00:24:10,387
Didn't he?

422
00:24:10,389 --> 00:24:13,056
Oh, you just know everything, don't you?

423
00:24:14,793 --> 00:24:16,626
Angels don't smoke!

424
00:24:18,563 --> 00:24:19,828
I'm going to sleep.

425
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,629
Good night.

426
00:24:25,033 --> 00:24:27,166
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

427
00:24:27,168 --> 00:24:29,434
That is a horrible expression.

428
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:34,338
It is not... an expression.

429
00:25:06,903 --> 00:25:09,203
Ooh, is that good?

430
00:25:09,205 --> 00:25:11,104
Oh... Ha ha!

431
00:25:11,106 --> 00:25:13,539
You're so hungry.
Ha ha!

432
00:25:13,541 --> 00:25:19,010
Ok... Ha ha!

433
00:25:19,012 --> 00:25:21,779
Aww... Ha!

434
00:25:21,781 --> 00:25:23,213
Good boy.

435
00:25:23,215 --> 00:25:26,816
Oh, what a sweet doggy.

436
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:28,884
Ha ha ha!

437
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:33,354
How would you like your eggs,
mr. Quinlan?

438
00:25:33,356 --> 00:25:34,955
Oh, Sparky's look good.

439
00:25:34,957 --> 00:25:36,756
Over easy!

440
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:55,173
You know, last night
we were discussing your wings.

441
00:25:55,175 --> 00:25:58,476
Would you mind if
I took a closer look?

442
00:25:58,478 --> 00:26:01,145
Let them look at your wings, Michael.

443
00:26:01,147 --> 00:26:03,080
They're from the<i> National Mirror.</i>

444
00:26:03,082 --> 00:26:04,648
Thank you.

445
00:26:06,385 --> 00:26:08,451
They're not bad.
Compared to what?

446
00:26:08,453 --> 00:26:09,985
Well, I've...
I've seen birds.

447
00:26:09,987 --> 00:26:13,822
Would you mind if I touched... oh!

448
00:26:13,824 --> 00:26:15,190
I'd rather you didn't.

449
00:26:15,192 --> 00:26:16,958
Hey, well...

450
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,959
Ha ha!

451
00:26:17,961 --> 00:26:19,226
We'd just like to take a look

452
00:26:19,228 --> 00:26:21,695
to see how you have
these things attached.

453
00:26:21,697 --> 00:26:23,963
Why don't you pull on your pecker

454
00:26:23,965 --> 00:26:25,364
and see how that's attached?

455
00:26:25,366 --> 00:26:27,833
Watch your language, mister.

456
00:26:27,835 --> 00:26:28,967
Pecker.

457
00:26:28,969 --> 00:26:30,969
An angel that says "pecker."

458
00:26:30,971 --> 00:26:34,272
Language, gentlemen!

459
00:26:34,274 --> 00:26:36,240
And how would you like your eggs, miss?

460
00:26:36,242 --> 00:26:38,108
Is there something in the oven

461
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,542
that smells so delicious?

462
00:26:39,544 --> 00:26:42,144
We are serving eggs this morning,
and that's that.

463
00:26:42,146 --> 00:26:44,913
Over easy would be just fine.

464
00:26:44,915 --> 00:26:47,015
Over easy!

465
00:26:48,151 --> 00:26:50,851
I thought angels were...

466
00:26:50,853 --> 00:26:51,852
Cleaner.

467
00:26:52,988 --> 00:26:54,287
She doesn't mean to offend.

468
00:26:54,289 --> 00:26:55,421
It's...

469
00:26:55,423 --> 00:26:57,990
Miss Winters is an angel expert,

470
00:26:57,992 --> 00:26:59,591
and she gets kind of...

471
00:26:59,593 --> 00:27:00,558
Literal.

472
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,926
What she probably
wants to know is...

473
00:27:04,963 --> 00:27:06,529
Can you fly?

474
00:27:06,531 --> 00:27:07,997
I do not want to know if he can fly.

475
00:27:07,999 --> 00:27:09,398
I know he can't fly.

476
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,899
Only little angels can fly
because their wingspan...

477
00:27:10,901 --> 00:27:12,233
Says who?

478
00:27:12,235 --> 00:27:14,134
I just thought...

479
00:27:14,136 --> 00:27:15,201
Halos?
Yes.

480
00:27:15,203 --> 00:27:17,102
Inner light?
Yes.

481
00:27:17,104 --> 00:27:20,305
I'm not that kind of angel.

482
00:27:20,307 --> 00:27:22,040
What kind of angel are you?

483
00:27:22,042 --> 00:27:24,308
Michael is an archangel.

484
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,709
He battled Lucifer

485
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:28,611
and threw him out of heaven.

486
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:30,512
<i>Revelation</i> 12, verse 7.

487
00:27:30,514 --> 00:27:32,247
That was a long time ago.

488
00:27:32,249 --> 00:27:35,216
He smote a bank for me!

489
00:27:35,218 --> 00:27:36,750
A bank?

490
00:27:36,752 --> 00:27:38,818
I knew it. Money was involved, wasn't it?

491
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,287
Oh, I should say so.

492
00:27:41,289 --> 00:27:42,821
After Elmer died...

493
00:27:42,823 --> 00:27:43,855
Who's Elmer?

494
00:27:43,857 --> 00:27:45,156
My husband.

495
00:27:45,158 --> 00:27:47,625
After he died,
they built the highway

496
00:27:47,627 --> 00:27:50,327
and stole all my truckers.

497
00:27:50,329 --> 00:27:55,364
And then the bank came
to take the milk bottle,

498
00:27:55,366 --> 00:27:59,166
and I prayed for help

499
00:27:59,168 --> 00:28:01,635
until God sent me Michael.

500
00:28:01,637 --> 00:28:04,070
Well, she was persistent.

501
00:28:04,072 --> 00:28:06,372
You came... down...

502
00:28:06,374 --> 00:28:07,706
and smote the bank?

503
00:28:07,708 --> 00:28:09,107
Eh, a branch.

504
00:28:09,109 --> 00:28:10,475
First Iowa bank of commerce.

505
00:28:10,477 --> 00:28:11,876
It was lovely.

506
00:28:11,878 --> 00:28:14,278
He walked into the manager's
office and said...

507
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,113
what was that you said?

508
00:28:16,115 --> 00:28:17,347
Moneychanger!

509
00:28:17,349 --> 00:28:19,549
Moneychanger!

510
00:28:19,551 --> 00:28:22,084
I shall turneth this earthly den

511
00:28:22,086 --> 00:28:24,986
into a parking lot!

512
00:28:24,988 --> 00:28:26,253
Come on.
Did I say that?

513
00:28:26,255 --> 00:28:27,520
I didn't say that.

514
00:28:27,522 --> 00:28:29,121
They didn't believe us,

515
00:28:29,123 --> 00:28:30,856
so Michael flattened it.

516
00:28:30,858 --> 00:28:32,257
You did that?

517
00:28:32,259 --> 00:28:33,258
Had to.

518
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,659
Into a parking lot?

519
00:28:34,661 --> 00:28:37,828
Well, they said
it was a tornado.

520
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:41,531
This town doesn't really
need a parking lot,

521
00:28:41,533 --> 00:28:46,668
but it's, uh, more, uh... cosmopolitan.

522
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:48,603
And what about the money?

523
00:28:48,605 --> 00:28:51,739
We never heard another
word about it, did we?

524
00:28:51,741 --> 00:28:52,940
Nope.

525
00:28:52,942 --> 00:28:57,310
You look like you must eat
a robust breakfast.

526
00:28:57,312 --> 00:28:59,078
How would you like your eggs?

527
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,516
Poached?

528
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,752
Uh, that's... poached is fine.

529
00:29:07,754 --> 00:29:09,419
Poached.

530
00:29:28,372 --> 00:29:30,305
The Lord is my shepherd.

531
00:29:30,307 --> 00:29:31,706
I shall not want.

532
00:29:31,708 --> 00:29:34,942
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

533
00:29:34,944 --> 00:29:37,978
He leadeth me beside
the still waters.

534
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:38,912
Look, she's...

535
00:29:38,914 --> 00:29:41,581
she's happier where she is, right?

536
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,916
Heaven?

537
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:47,385
She's happier up there, right?

538
00:29:47,387 --> 00:29:50,254
It isn't my area.

539
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:59,328
You hardly knew her.

540
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,863
She died cooking us breakfast.

541
00:30:04,334 --> 00:30:06,834
She died making breakfast.

542
00:30:13,141 --> 00:30:17,076
What is it that you keep
writing in that book?

543
00:30:17,078 --> 00:30:18,944
Lyrics.

544
00:30:19,947 --> 00:30:21,279
To what?

545
00:30:21,281 --> 00:30:23,948
I write country-western songs.

546
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,649
It's my hobby.

547
00:30:26,885 --> 00:30:28,351
Earth to earth,

548
00:30:28,353 --> 00:30:30,519
ashes to ashes,

549
00:30:30,521 --> 00:30:33,154
dust to dust.

550
00:30:33,156 --> 00:30:35,055
The Lord bless and keep you

551
00:30:35,057 --> 00:30:37,023
and give you peace.

552
00:30:38,026 --> 00:30:39,759
Justine?
It's Quinlan.

553
00:30:39,761 --> 00:30:41,227
Put me straight through.

554
00:30:41,229 --> 00:30:42,828
What you got?

555
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,296
Wings.

556
00:30:44,298 --> 00:30:45,430
Real wings.

557
00:30:45,432 --> 00:30:47,765
Don't play with me, Quinlan.

558
00:30:47,767 --> 00:30:50,968
This guy is about 6 feet tall,

559
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:52,035
and his wings

560
00:30:52,037 --> 00:30:54,971
reach from his shoulders to his knees.

561
00:30:54,973 --> 00:30:55,905
He's filthy, though.

562
00:30:55,907 --> 00:30:56,906
We're gonna have to clean him up

563
00:30:56,908 --> 00:30:58,173
and put him in a white robe.

564
00:30:58,175 --> 00:31:00,975
Get Craddock to dig up
some of those sandals.

565
00:31:00,977 --> 00:31:03,043
You know, the ones with those straps
that go up your legs.

566
00:31:03,045 --> 00:31:05,512
It's too bad he's not
blond, all right.

567
00:31:05,514 --> 00:31:06,579
Angels is supposed to be blond.

568
00:31:06,581 --> 00:31:08,013
But<i> Oprah,</i> Barbara,

569
00:31:08,015 --> 00:31:10,615
the<i> Today</i> show, <i>Hard copy,</i>

570
00:31:10,617 --> 00:31:12,350
book the works.

571
00:31:12,352 --> 00:31:13,718
Then let's don't mess this one up.

572
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,620
I want that guy on the first plane to Chicago...

573
00:31:16,622 --> 00:31:18,955
or does the birdman fly himself?

574
00:31:18,957 --> 00:31:22,625
I don't know if he
actually uses the wings,

575
00:31:22,627 --> 00:31:24,393
but, God, wouldn't that be a draw?

576
00:31:24,395 --> 00:31:27,062
Anyway, don't worry,
he's in safe hands.

577
00:31:27,064 --> 00:31:29,364
Yeah, and I'm the queen of England.

578
00:31:29,366 --> 00:31:31,432
Don't fret, Malt.

579
00:31:33,602 --> 00:31:35,635
He's in safe hands.

580
00:31:35,637 --> 00:31:37,203
In view of this development,

581
00:31:37,205 --> 00:31:38,437
should we call the girl off?

582
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:41,273
No, no.
Leave her where she is.

583
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:43,675
I'm in a no-lose situation.

584
00:31:43,677 --> 00:31:45,910
Heh heh heh heh!

585
00:31:54,253 --> 00:31:55,518
Hey ya, Mike.

586
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,919
Michael.

587
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:03,457
Have you, um...

588
00:32:03,459 --> 00:32:04,858
Have you ever seen

589
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:07,460
the world's biggest ball of twine?

590
00:32:07,462 --> 00:32:08,661
No.

591
00:32:08,663 --> 00:32:10,029
Listen, we have to get back.

592
00:32:10,031 --> 00:32:13,165
I once saw the world's
biggest cannonball.

593
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:14,299
Mesopotamia.

594
00:32:14,301 --> 00:32:15,933
I wonder if it's still there.

595
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:17,668
Mesopotamia isn't still there.

596
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:20,570
Ohh! Nothing lasts.

597
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:23,406
Listen, I have to ask a favor.

598
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:24,807
Huey and I,

599
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:28,276
we're on a little bit
of a losing streak.

600
00:32:28,278 --> 00:32:30,111
Quit.

601
00:32:30,113 --> 00:32:31,512
We can't quit.

602
00:32:31,514 --> 00:32:32,913
He's got a mortgage.

603
00:32:32,915 --> 00:32:34,648
He's got 3 kids in a soccer camp.

604
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:35,649
He's got a wife.

605
00:32:35,651 --> 00:32:37,083
God knows he loves her,

606
00:32:37,085 --> 00:32:38,918
but she's burning
a hole in his pocket.

607
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,786
And I...

608
00:32:41,588 --> 00:32:43,220
Well...

609
00:32:43,222 --> 00:32:44,888
Love to fight.
Like me.

610
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:46,155
We'll drive.

611
00:32:46,157 --> 00:32:47,322
Where?

612
00:32:47,324 --> 00:32:49,357
Chicago. That's where
you want to go, isn't it?

613
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:50,358
Yes!

614
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,759
Yeah. I know.

615
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:52,960
That's why I wrote you.

616
00:32:52,962 --> 00:32:54,561
<i>You</i> wrote?
I thought...

617
00:32:54,563 --> 00:32:56,162
Yeah. My idea.

618
00:32:56,164 --> 00:32:57,296
Ah.

619
00:32:57,298 --> 00:32:58,697
Why are we driving?

620
00:32:58,699 --> 00:33:02,000
I mean, why don't we fly?

621
00:33:02,002 --> 00:33:03,801
I mean, all of us,

622
00:33:03,803 --> 00:33:05,669
together, in a plane.

623
00:33:05,671 --> 00:33:07,270
It's safer, much safer.

624
00:33:07,272 --> 00:33:08,671
Nobody believes it,

625
00:33:08,673 --> 00:33:12,174
but, statistically, it's true,

626
00:33:12,176 --> 00:33:14,176
and the paper will pay.

627
00:33:14,178 --> 00:33:15,577
Nope. We need time.

628
00:33:15,579 --> 00:33:17,279
Time for what?

629
00:33:17,281 --> 00:33:18,413
Smokes.

630
00:33:18,415 --> 00:33:19,414
Smokes. Ah.

631
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:21,549
Besides... I will get to see

632
00:33:21,551 --> 00:33:24,418
the world's largest ball of twine.

633
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,419
It's on the way.

634
00:33:25,421 --> 00:33:26,753
Great. Great.

635
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,221
One one condition:
you will owe me something.

636
00:33:28,223 --> 00:33:30,823
Money. Yeah. I can't quote a figure,

637
00:33:30,825 --> 00:33:32,825
but there will be plenty of money,

638
00:33:32,827 --> 00:33:34,960
I promise you that,

639
00:33:34,962 --> 00:33:37,195
once the world sees pictures of these babies.

640
00:33:37,197 --> 00:33:39,564
No. You will owe me an apology.

641
00:33:39,566 --> 00:33:41,399
An apology for what?

642
00:33:41,401 --> 00:33:43,501
Oh, yeah, sure.
I apologize.

643
00:33:43,503 --> 00:33:44,602
Whatever.

644
00:33:44,604 --> 00:33:46,337
Not now.
When I say so.

645
00:33:46,339 --> 00:33:47,204
And no pictures.

646
00:33:47,206 --> 00:33:49,873
No pictures?
Are you kidding me?

647
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:53,042
Not until we get to Chicago.

648
00:33:53,044 --> 00:33:54,476
Deal?

649
00:33:54,478 --> 00:33:55,677
Deal.

650
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,245
Hmm...

651
00:34:04,086 --> 00:34:06,252
I like your coat better.

652
00:34:06,254 --> 00:34:08,287
It's yours.

653
00:34:30,677 --> 00:34:33,044
The world's biggest ball of twine

654
00:34:33,046 --> 00:34:34,779
is less than 2 hours from here.

655
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,280
I would like to see it
before the sun sets.

656
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:38,882
Michael, they are going to exploit you.

657
00:34:38,884 --> 00:34:40,750
You have to know that.

658
00:34:40,752 --> 00:34:41,751
I'm going.

659
00:34:41,753 --> 00:34:44,553
Well, I'm not, for your sake.

660
00:34:44,555 --> 00:34:45,954
Yes, you are,

661
00:34:45,956 --> 00:34:48,222
or I'll have to tell them
the truth about you.

662
00:34:48,224 --> 00:34:49,389
What?

663
00:34:49,391 --> 00:34:51,224
I know why you're here,

664
00:34:51,226 --> 00:34:54,260
and it has nothing
to do with angels.

665
00:34:54,262 --> 00:34:56,495
How do you know?

666
00:34:56,497 --> 00:34:59,097
I pay attention.

667
00:35:07,507 --> 00:35:08,772
Also...

668
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:10,440
I would like you to sing.

669
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:11,607
A song?
Of course.

670
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:15,310
Fine. I'll sing.

671
00:35:15,312 --> 00:35:16,577
Now?

672
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:17,711
No.

673
00:35:17,713 --> 00:35:19,446
When I tell you to.

674
00:35:37,598 --> 00:35:39,531
¶ Hoo! ¶

675
00:35:39,533 --> 00:35:43,234
¶ there's a place up ahead,
and I'm goin' ¶

676
00:35:43,236 --> 00:35:47,003

677
00:35:47,005 --> 00:35:49,005

00:35:49,007 --> 00:35:50,673
¶ if you're goin' ¶

00:35:50,675 --> 00:35:54,576
¶ leave the sinkin' ship

00:35:54,578 --> 00:35:57,712
¶ come on the risin' wind ¶

681
00:35:57,714 --> 00:36:01,515
¶ we're goin' up

682
00:36:01,517 --> 00:36:03,583
¶ hoo! ¶

683
00:36:03,585 --> 00:36:07,386
¶ bring a song and a smile
for the banjo ¶

684
00:36:07,388 --> 00:36:10,956
¶ better git

¶ come on the risin' wind ¶

688
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,300
¶ we're goin' up

689
00:36:24,302 --> 00:36:26,201
In financial news,

690
00:36:26,203 --> 00:36:28,970
hog futures are down
1/4 in Chicago

691
00:36:28,972 --> 00:36:31,238
and selling down 1/8 in Sioux City.

692
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,372
Hog futures.

693
00:36:32,374 --> 00:36:33,473
Ha ha ha!

694
00:36:33,475 --> 00:36:34,574
What?

695
00:36:39,514 --> 00:36:43,182
Hog futures are down 1/4.

696
00:36:43,184 --> 00:36:45,584
Hey. What's
the opposite of white?

697
00:36:45,586 --> 00:36:46,585
Black.

698
00:36:46,587 --> 00:36:48,186
Wrong. Yolk.

699
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:54,190
What?

700
00:36:54,192 --> 00:36:56,192
What is that,
like, an egg joke?

701
00:36:56,194 --> 00:36:58,427
Hey, Michael, when we stop to eat,

702
00:36:58,429 --> 00:37:00,395
are you going to put your coat back on?

703
00:37:00,397 --> 00:37:01,396
Why?

704
00:37:01,398 --> 00:37:02,397
Your wings, Michael.

705
00:37:02,399 --> 00:37:04,132
People are going
to see your wings.

706
00:37:04,134 --> 00:37:06,633
Are you afraid they'll
think less of you?

707
00:37:08,236 --> 00:37:09,335
No.

708
00:37:09,337 --> 00:37:11,303
Just they won't know
what to think, you know?

709
00:37:11,305 --> 00:37:14,539
A lot of people aren't
as sophisticated as me and Huey.

710
00:37:14,541 --> 00:37:15,673
Oh.

711
00:37:15,675 --> 00:37:17,007
You know, we don't
want any trouble.

712
00:37:17,009 --> 00:37:18,875
We just want to get to Chicago.

713
00:37:18,877 --> 00:37:20,076
Mm-hmm.

714
00:37:20,078 --> 00:37:21,210
He's worried that
somebody will see you

715
00:37:21,212 --> 00:37:22,678
and try to steal his story.

716
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,812
I am not worried.

717
00:37:23,814 --> 00:37:24,979
Yes, you are worried.

718
00:37:24,981 --> 00:37:27,548
Hey! Hey!
Look what Pansy left us.

719
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:29,716
Car bingo.

720
00:37:29,718 --> 00:37:31,784
Oh. Dig the propaganda.

721
00:37:31,786 --> 00:37:33,185
"The Miles will fly,

722
00:37:33,187 --> 00:37:35,854
"and your children won't cry

723
00:37:35,856 --> 00:37:37,422
if you play..."

724
00:37:37,424 --> 00:37:38,356
Car bingo.

725
00:37:38,358 --> 00:37:40,224
All right. Everybody gets one.

726
00:37:40,226 --> 00:37:42,526
Here we go.
Hand them out.

727
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:44,528
So, what do we do?

728
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:45,795
Here are the pencils.

729
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:47,062
Instead of writing down a number,

730
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:50,131
you write down what you see on your trip.

731
00:37:50,133 --> 00:37:52,466
Ok. Dog. One point for me.

732
00:37:52,468 --> 00:37:53,700
No. That's not fair.

733
00:37:53,702 --> 00:37:54,967
You've played this before.

734
00:37:54,969 --> 00:37:56,234
It's not fair to me.
I'm driving.

735
00:37:56,236 --> 00:37:57,835
Deal with it.
Bird on a wire.

736
00:37:57,837 --> 00:37:59,203
Picket fence.

737
00:37:59,205 --> 00:38:00,237
Policeman.

738
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:02,305
Where? Where?

739
00:38:08,446 --> 00:38:10,245
Ah, that was good.

740
00:38:10,247 --> 00:38:11,246
Oh-ho.

741
00:38:11,248 --> 00:38:14,215
Oh. You gotta learn to laugh.

742
00:38:14,217 --> 00:38:17,351
It's the way to true love.

743
00:38:18,821 --> 00:38:21,822
¶ Come on the risin' wind ¶

744
00:38:21,824 --> 00:38:26,058
¶ we're goin' up
around the bend ¶

745
00:38:27,828 --> 00:38:29,660
¶ do do doo-doo ¶

746
00:38:31,597 --> 00:38:33,262
¶ do do doo-doo... ¶

747
00:38:43,773 --> 00:38:46,974
"The world's largest ball of twine

748
00:38:46,976 --> 00:38:48,742
has a circumference of 45 feet."

749
00:38:48,744 --> 00:38:50,343
What's the excuse?

750
00:38:50,345 --> 00:38:52,411
Well, it's just going to take
a little longer than we thought

751
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,879
because we have to stay
off the main highway.

752
00:38:53,881 --> 00:38:54,913
Fly.

753
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,514
He won't fly.

754
00:38:56,516 --> 00:38:57,448
Why?

755
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:58,916
Because he can't fit
in coach seats.

756
00:38:58,918 --> 00:39:00,717
His wings take too much space.

757
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:02,251
Wanna pay first class?

758
00:39:02,253 --> 00:39:03,218
Drive.

759
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,153
"Eventually, it was
transported here.

760
00:39:05,155 --> 00:39:06,287
"There is enough twine

761
00:39:06,289 --> 00:39:10,324
to stock 5,000
hardware stores..."

762
00:39:14,229 --> 00:39:16,195
Battle.

763
00:39:21,902 --> 00:39:23,067
We'll be there.
Don't worry.

764
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,069
What can happen, you know?

765
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,669
Trust me.
Nothing.

766
00:39:25,671 --> 00:39:26,903
Michael?

767
00:39:26,905 --> 00:39:29,872
Don't fret, Malt.

768
00:39:29,874 --> 00:39:30,939
Quinlan!

769
00:39:30,941 --> 00:39:32,206
Michael!

770
00:39:33,275 --> 00:39:34,741
Michael!

771
00:39:34,743 --> 00:39:38,444
What are you doing!?

772
00:39:45,351 --> 00:39:47,284
Battle!

773
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:00,429
Michael.

774
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:02,097
Michael.

775
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,232
Michael, you know what that is?

776
00:40:05,435 --> 00:40:07,535
Battle!

777
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,109
Michael. Don't.

778
00:40:34,828 --> 00:40:36,394
Michael.

779
00:40:43,035 --> 00:40:44,534
Michael.

780
00:40:44,536 --> 00:40:45,868
Ha!

781
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:48,604
I am completely happy.

782
00:40:48,606 --> 00:40:49,871
Are you all right?

783
00:40:49,873 --> 00:40:51,472
Can you feel your legs?

784
00:40:51,474 --> 00:40:52,473
Whooo.

785
00:40:52,475 --> 00:40:53,907
Ha ha ha.

786
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:58,877
No injuries.
6,360 battles.

787
00:40:58,879 --> 00:41:00,144
Can you sit up?

788
00:41:00,146 --> 00:41:02,412
Of course I can sit up.

789
00:41:06,016 --> 00:41:07,949
Ah. Now that...

790
00:41:07,951 --> 00:41:09,718
That is my nature.

791
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,719
Yes.

792
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:12,687
I am a grass roller,

793
00:41:12,689 --> 00:41:14,689
but I'm doomed to live in one place

794
00:41:14,691 --> 00:41:16,323
and crave the pleasures of another.

795
00:41:16,325 --> 00:41:18,224
But don't you feel sorry for me, no.

796
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:19,959
Why would we feel sorry for you?

797
00:41:19,961 --> 00:41:21,260
Because this is my last blast.

798
00:41:21,262 --> 00:41:22,861
26. That's all we get.

799
00:41:22,863 --> 00:41:24,462
Thank you, Quinlan.

800
00:41:24,464 --> 00:41:25,563
For what?

801
00:41:25,565 --> 00:41:28,132
I think he's saying
there's no sex in heaven.

802
00:41:28,134 --> 00:41:29,633
Is that what he's saying?

803
00:41:29,635 --> 00:41:32,102
You know, it's really not polite

804
00:41:32,104 --> 00:41:33,770
to talk about someone
in the third person

805
00:41:33,772 --> 00:41:34,704
when that person is here.

806
00:41:34,706 --> 00:41:36,739
I know. I'm very sorry.
Sparky!

807
00:41:36,741 --> 00:41:39,875
What do you mean...

808
00:41:39,877 --> 00:41:41,276
"Last blast"?

809
00:41:41,278 --> 00:41:43,945
Only so many visits allowed.

810
00:41:46,215 --> 00:41:50,483
I'm going to miss
everything so much.

811
00:41:50,485 --> 00:41:52,151
Ooh...

812
00:41:54,755 --> 00:41:55,820
Mmm!

813
00:42:01,861 --> 00:42:04,695
Why are you here?

814
00:42:04,697 --> 00:42:08,198
Why are you saying
it has anything to do with me?

815
00:42:12,503 --> 00:42:14,469
The sun was having an argument
with the north wind:

816
00:42:14,471 --> 00:42:16,604
Who was smarter,
who was stronger.

817
00:42:16,606 --> 00:42:18,872
The north wind pointed out a man
walking down the street.

818
00:42:18,874 --> 00:42:22,208
"I bet I can make that man
take off his coat, and you can't."

819
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:24,243
"I'll take that bet," said the sun.

820
00:42:24,245 --> 00:42:25,911
The north wind blew
and blew and blew,

821
00:42:25,913 --> 00:42:27,345
and the more that wind blew,

822
00:42:27,347 --> 00:42:29,180
the tighter that man
held that coat around himself.

823
00:42:29,182 --> 00:42:32,816
And then the sun
came out and smiled,

824
00:42:32,818 --> 00:42:34,584
and it became warmer.

825
00:42:34,586 --> 00:42:36,419
The man took off his coat.

826
00:42:41,558 --> 00:42:45,059
What is that supposed to mean?

827
00:42:45,061 --> 00:42:46,760
Did you make a bet about me?

828
00:42:46,762 --> 00:42:49,329
Well, I had to get
back here somehow.

829
00:42:49,331 --> 00:42:51,997
Hey, watch the wings there, buddy.

830
00:43:03,409 --> 00:43:06,109
¶ sittin', thinkin' ¶

831
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:08,911
¶ sinkin', drinkin' ¶

832
00:43:08,913 --> 00:43:10,545
¶ wonderin' what I'll do ¶

833
00:43:10,547 --> 00:43:12,980
¶ when I'm through
tonight... ¶

834
00:43:12,982 --> 00:43:14,948
That's not how you eat a lemon.

835
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:17,483
How do you eat a lemon?

836
00:43:18,252 --> 00:43:20,585
You cut it in half...

837
00:43:21,955 --> 00:43:23,354
Put salt on it.

838
00:43:23,356 --> 00:43:24,421
That is how <i>you</i> eat a lemon.

839
00:43:24,423 --> 00:43:25,555
That's how you eat a lemon.

840
00:43:25,557 --> 00:43:27,290
Oh, is this a rule?

841
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:31,392
Hey.

842
00:43:31,394 --> 00:43:33,327
Hey to you, too.

843
00:43:37,632 --> 00:43:38,764
Thank you.

844
00:43:38,766 --> 00:43:40,632
Do you have pie?

845
00:43:43,236 --> 00:43:45,736
Do you have pie?

846
00:43:45,738 --> 00:43:47,537
No.

847
00:43:56,381 --> 00:43:58,013
I'm a writer, too.

848
00:43:58,015 --> 00:43:59,014
Oh, really?

849
00:43:59,016 --> 00:44:00,148
What did you write?

850
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:01,749
<i>Psalm 85.</i>

851
00:44:02,918 --> 00:44:05,985
It wasn't called<i> psalm 85</i> when I wrote it.

852
00:44:05,987 --> 00:44:07,386
I had no idea

853
00:44:07,388 --> 00:44:10,389
they were going to be
collected and numbered.

854
00:44:15,728 --> 00:44:17,360
Yeah. Yeah.

855
00:44:17,362 --> 00:44:18,728
It was right around the time

856
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:20,730
I invented standing in line.

857
00:44:20,732 --> 00:44:22,398
You invented standing in line?

858
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,067
Before that, everybody
just milled around.

859
00:44:25,069 --> 00:44:26,268
It was a mess.

860
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:28,270
So one day I said,
"why not make a line?"

861
00:44:28,272 --> 00:44:29,304
A line for what?

862
00:44:29,306 --> 00:44:30,705
To get in.

863
00:44:30,707 --> 00:44:33,274
Why don't you ask him
what you want to know?

864
00:44:33,276 --> 00:44:34,742
What do I want to know?

865
00:44:34,744 --> 00:44:37,444
He wants to know why angels
don't solve big problems.

866
00:44:37,446 --> 00:44:39,279
That is what I want to know.

867
00:44:39,281 --> 00:44:42,415
Why don't angels
solve big problems?

868
00:44:42,417 --> 00:44:46,151
You can't change
the nature of the world.

869
00:44:46,153 --> 00:44:47,552
What can you do?

870
00:44:47,554 --> 00:44:50,154
Small miracles.
Only so many.

871
00:44:50,156 --> 00:44:52,156
Some angels aren't so smart.

872
00:44:52,158 --> 00:44:56,192
They use them up in stupid ways.

873
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:58,327
Like the "parking space" angel?

874
00:44:58,329 --> 00:45:00,629
I don't like to criticize other angels.

875
00:45:04,301 --> 00:45:06,234
I'll, uh, be with you in a minute.

876
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:08,436
Yup.

877
00:45:09,705 --> 00:45:13,172
This is how you eat a lemon.

878
00:45:13,174 --> 00:45:14,940
Hey.

879
00:45:17,077 --> 00:45:18,209
Excuse me.

880
00:45:18,211 --> 00:45:19,510
They want me.

881
00:45:19,512 --> 00:45:22,713
Now, remember what
John and Paul said.

882
00:45:22,715 --> 00:45:23,513
The apostles?

883
00:45:23,515 --> 00:45:25,181
No. The Beatles.

884
00:45:25,183 --> 00:45:27,449
All you need is love.

885
00:45:27,451 --> 00:45:29,584
Hello, ladies.

886
00:45:36,625 --> 00:45:38,891
Do you believe in angels?

887
00:45:38,893 --> 00:45:39,892
Absolutely.

888
00:45:39,894 --> 00:45:41,593
Have you ever,
ever heard of an angel

889
00:45:41,595 --> 00:45:43,194
that was interested in sex?

890
00:45:43,196 --> 00:45:44,595
Of course not.

891
00:45:44,597 --> 00:45:46,363
Angels do not have sex.

892
00:45:46,365 --> 00:45:48,031
But is there one?

893
00:45:48,033 --> 00:45:50,666
And I suppose he invented
standing in line.

894
00:45:50,668 --> 00:45:51,633
Sparky,

895
00:45:51,635 --> 00:45:54,202
I'm going to take you for a walk.

896
00:45:55,338 --> 00:45:56,603
Let's go.

897
00:45:56,605 --> 00:45:59,472

Awoo!

946
00:48:08,871 --> 00:48:11,771
I invented the hole in the
coffee cup, you know.

947
00:48:11,773 --> 00:48:13,873
When you get coffee to go,

948
00:48:13,875 --> 00:48:17,409
I was the first person

949
00:48:17,411 --> 00:48:18,943
to rip that little hole in the lid

950
00:48:18,945 --> 00:48:20,711
so you could drink it in the car.

951
00:48:20,713 --> 00:48:22,546
Could've made a fortune.

952
00:48:22,548 --> 00:48:23,880
It's weird.

953
00:48:23,882 --> 00:48:24,714
What?

954
00:48:24,716 --> 00:48:26,916
She's an angel expert, but....

955
00:48:26,918 --> 00:48:27,716
What?

956
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:31,818
Battle!

957
00:48:34,589 --> 00:48:36,221
Come on!

958
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:42,392
For God's sake.
Michael.

959
00:48:42,394 --> 00:48:43,860
Stop.

960
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,866
Hey. You.

961
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:02,409
Battle.

962
00:49:02,411 --> 00:49:04,010
You'd better believe it.

963
00:49:04,012 --> 00:49:05,211
Over here!

964
00:49:32,606 --> 00:49:33,605
It's caramels.

965
00:49:33,607 --> 00:49:35,206
He smells like caramels.

966
00:49:35,208 --> 00:49:36,607
It's cotton candy.

967
00:49:36,609 --> 00:49:37,608
It's cookies.

968
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:39,009
He smells like cookies,

969
00:49:39,011 --> 00:49:41,311
and the smell gets stronger
when he's in heat.

970
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:09,871
Eee-yah!

971
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:18,112
You're a great fighter.

972
00:50:18,114 --> 00:50:19,613
I certainly am.

973
00:50:19,615 --> 00:50:21,214
I'm cold.

974
00:50:21,216 --> 00:50:22,315
My head hurts.

975
00:50:22,317 --> 00:50:24,617
You folks from the<i> National Mirror?</i>

976
00:50:24,619 --> 00:50:26,885
I got a 2-headed
chicken in my yard,

977
00:50:26,887 --> 00:50:28,052
if you're interested.

978
00:50:28,054 --> 00:50:29,520
What are we being held for?

979
00:50:29,522 --> 00:50:31,388
Destruction of property,

980
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:33,390
assault, battery,

981
00:50:33,392 --> 00:50:34,958
and disturbing the peace.

982
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,793
Magistrate will be here in the morning.

983
00:50:36,795 --> 00:50:38,227
Your honor, I didn't have
anything to do with this.

984
00:50:38,229 --> 00:50:39,228
Good night.

985
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:40,629
Hey. Hey, hey.

986
00:50:40,631 --> 00:50:42,997
We have a phone call coming to us.

987
00:50:43,933 --> 00:50:45,365
Hey.

988
00:50:48,002 --> 00:50:49,801
Wah-yaaah.

989
00:50:49,803 --> 00:50:51,936
Woo woo-woo.

990
00:50:58,410 --> 00:51:00,076
Ralph got thrown in jail,

991
00:51:00,078 --> 00:51:02,812
but at least he had the decency
to keep me out of it.

992
00:51:02,814 --> 00:51:05,447
I don't want to spend the night here.

993
00:51:05,449 --> 00:51:06,848
I hate you.

994
00:51:06,850 --> 00:51:09,417
You hate me?
Not you.

995
00:51:09,419 --> 00:51:11,419
You hate me?
Not you.

996
00:51:11,421 --> 00:51:12,820
The process of elimination.

997
00:51:12,822 --> 00:51:14,555
Who is Ralph?

998
00:51:14,557 --> 00:51:17,824
Another husband...

999
00:51:17,826 --> 00:51:19,559
Has popped up.

1000
00:51:19,561 --> 00:51:22,361
Maybe Sparky can get us out.

1001
00:51:22,363 --> 00:51:23,362
Hey.

1002
00:51:23,364 --> 00:51:24,229
Sparky?

1003
00:51:24,231 --> 00:51:27,898
Go in the drawer
and get the key.

1004
00:51:28,667 --> 00:51:30,333
Sparky.

1005
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:33,769
Go in the drawer

1006
00:51:33,771 --> 00:51:36,371
and get the key.

1007
00:51:38,575 --> 00:51:40,041
Dorothy can make him do it.

1008
00:51:40,043 --> 00:51:41,642
Dorothy's good with dogs.

1009
00:51:41,644 --> 00:51:44,277
I have noticed this.

1010
00:51:44,279 --> 00:51:46,846
Dogs don't talk.

1011
00:51:46,848 --> 00:51:48,848
They don't shave.

1012
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:52,985
They don't run off in your Camaro.

1013
00:51:52,987 --> 00:51:55,120
When you want them to take a bath,

1014
00:51:55,122 --> 00:51:57,522
you just make an appointment.

1015
00:51:57,524 --> 00:51:58,523
Sit.

1016
00:51:58,525 --> 00:51:59,524
Stay.

1017
00:51:59,526 --> 00:52:01,025
Roll over.

1018
00:52:01,027 --> 00:52:02,959
No.

1019
00:52:04,595 --> 00:52:06,127
Now.

1020
00:52:08,331 --> 00:52:09,596
What?

1021
00:52:09,598 --> 00:52:11,197
Apologize.

1022
00:52:11,199 --> 00:52:12,765
Say you're sorry.

1023
00:52:12,767 --> 00:52:14,199
To her?

1024
00:52:14,201 --> 00:52:16,067
Be serious.

1025
00:52:17,003 --> 00:52:18,469
Or...

1026
00:52:18,471 --> 00:52:20,737
I'm not going to...

1027
00:52:20,739 --> 00:52:22,338

I'm sorry.

1038
00:53:09,711 --> 00:53:11,644
I didn't mean it...

1039
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:13,077
Ok?

1040
00:53:15,114 --> 00:53:17,013

Take my blanket, ok?

1044
00:53:54,346 --> 00:53:55,945
I'm going to sleep.

1045
00:53:57,682 --> 00:53:59,348
Me, too.

1046
00:54:53,802 --> 00:54:55,601
All rise, all rise.

1047
00:54:55,603 --> 00:54:58,470
The court of bickle county
is now in session.

1048
00:54:58,472 --> 00:55:00,672
The honorable judge
Esther Newberg presiding.

1049
00:55:00,674 --> 00:55:01,939
Please rise.

1050
00:55:06,277 --> 00:55:07,376
Ahem.

1051
00:55:07,378 --> 00:55:08,543
Be seated.

1052
00:55:11,814 --> 00:55:13,547
Now...

1053
00:55:13,549 --> 00:55:15,682
You are charged with...

1054
00:55:15,684 --> 00:55:16,816
Disturbing the peace,

1055
00:55:16,818 --> 00:55:18,450
destruction of property...

1056
00:55:18,452 --> 00:55:19,784
$1,200 worth.

1057
00:55:19,786 --> 00:55:21,085
I know.
I spoke to Jenny.

1058
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:23,554
Who's, uh, Jenny?

1059
00:55:23,556 --> 00:55:24,821
That's his wife.

1060
00:55:24,823 --> 00:55:26,055
She told me

1061
00:55:26,057 --> 00:55:27,956
that sweet little painting
above the bar...

1062
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:29,958
uh, 2 moose hunters in a canoe...

1063
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,426
smashed to smithereens.

1064
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:32,693
That is so sad.

1065
00:55:32,695 --> 00:55:33,794
Yep.

1066
00:55:33,796 --> 00:55:35,962
Isn't this a conflict of interest?

1067
00:55:35,964 --> 00:55:37,496
Did I say you could speak?

1068
00:55:39,099 --> 00:55:41,699
I know someone who can restore paintings.

1069
00:55:41,701 --> 00:55:43,100
I told Jenny, "stop crying.

1070
00:55:43,102 --> 00:55:44,835
I will take care of it."

1071
00:55:44,837 --> 00:55:46,069
Now...

1072
00:55:46,071 --> 00:55:49,338
Who can tell me
exactly what happened l...

1073
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:50,439
Last night?

1074
00:55:50,441 --> 00:55:51,440
I can.

1075
00:55:51,442 --> 00:55:52,707
Anyone else?

1076
00:55:52,709 --> 00:55:54,542
We were having dinner...

1077
00:55:54,544 --> 00:55:56,310
Not you.

1078
00:55:56,312 --> 00:55:57,110
If I may...

1079
00:55:57,112 --> 00:55:58,845
put your hand down.

1080
00:55:58,847 --> 00:56:00,313
You.

1081
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:01,447
Please.

1082
00:56:02,383 --> 00:56:04,716
In chambers.

1083
00:56:04,718 --> 00:56:07,719
All rise, all rise.

00:56:07,721 --> 00:56:09,120

Hey! Wait a minute.

1138
00:57:49,298 --> 00:57:51,498
Wait, wait. Meadsboro 1 mile.

1139
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:52,899
So?

1140
00:57:52,901 --> 00:57:55,301
So that's where the world's 
largest non-stick frying pan is.

1141
00:57:55,303 --> 00:57:56,902
Oh, no, Michael.

1142
00:57:56,904 --> 00:57:58,303
We are not stopping

1143
00:57:58,305 --> 00:58:00,905
to see the world's largest 
non-stick frying pan.

1144
00:58:00,907 --> 00:58:01,906
Why not?

1145
00:58:01,908 --> 00:58:03,073
Because we have to get back.

1146
00:58:03,075 --> 00:58:04,674
Well, me, too,

1147
00:58:04,676 --> 00:58:06,108
but before that happens,

1148
00:58:06,110 --> 00:58:08,977
I would like to see the world's 
largest non-stick frying pan.

1149
00:58:08,979 --> 00:58:10,144
It<i> is</i> on the way.

1150
00:58:10,146 --> 00:58:11,145
Every time we stop somewhere,

1151
00:58:11,147 --> 00:58:12,412
he gets us in trouble.

1152
00:58:12,414 --> 00:58:14,147
But he also gets us out of trouble.

1153
00:58:14,149 --> 00:58:15,748
Huey!
Huey!

1154
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:16,749
What?

1155
00:58:16,751 --> 00:58:18,083
Well, he<i> does.</i>

1156
00:58:18,085 --> 00:58:21,152
I mean, look, that judge just took
one look at him and...

1157
00:58:21,154 --> 00:58:22,319
what is that?

1158
00:58:22,321 --> 00:58:24,154
What is it about you?

1159
00:58:24,156 --> 00:58:25,421
What?

1160
00:58:25,423 --> 00:58:27,956
As a woman, could you
explain that to me?

1161
00:58:27,958 --> 00:58:31,159
How should I know?
I'm not the least bit attracted to him.

1162
00:58:31,161 --> 00:58:33,161
No offense, Michael, but I'm not.

1163
00:58:33,163 --> 00:58:34,896
I put a block on you.

1164
00:58:34,898 --> 00:58:35,897
Oh, sure.

1165
00:58:35,899 --> 00:58:36,898
I did.

1166
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:39,300
All right, to continue...

1167
00:58:39,302 --> 00:58:41,268
"Presumably...

1168
00:58:41,270 --> 00:58:43,570
"This frying pan was coated with teflon

1169
00:58:43,572 --> 00:58:46,172
"to save a wee bit on
the amount of cholesterol

1170
00:58:46,174 --> 00:58:48,574
"ingested by the town
of meadsboro every year

1171
00:58:48,576 --> 00:58:50,909
when they get together
to honor the egg."

1172
00:58:50,911 --> 00:58:52,310
Michael, we're not stopping.

1173
00:58:52,312 --> 00:58:54,845
You have 10 seconds
to change your mind.

1174
00:58:55,781 --> 00:58:57,180
10-hippopotamus.

1175
00:58:57,182 --> 00:58:58,915
9-hippopotamus.

1176
00:58:58,917 --> 00:59:00,182
8-hippopotamus.

1177
00:59:00,184 --> 00:59:02,184
How much more attractive
is he than I am?

1178
00:59:02,186 --> 00:59:03,185
7-hippopotamus.

1179
00:59:03,187 --> 00:59:04,186
Be honest with me.

1180
00:59:04,188 --> 00:59:05,820
Huey, this is not healthy.

1181
00:59:05,822 --> 00:59:07,855
5-hippopotamus

1182
00:59:07,857 --> 00:59:09,489
4-hippopotamus.

1183
00:59:09,491 --> 00:59:10,623
3, 2, 1!

1184
00:59:41,084 --> 00:59:42,483
There's no jack!

1185
00:59:42,485 --> 00:59:44,184
Of course there is no jack!

1186
00:59:44,186 --> 00:59:46,186
Just ask him to fix it.

1187
00:59:46,188 --> 00:59:48,188
He blew it, he can fix it!

1188
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:50,757
Fix this tire!
Come back here this instant

1189
00:59:50,759 --> 00:59:52,191
and fix this tire!

1190
00:59:52,193 --> 00:59:54,459
No can do.

1191
01:00:07,373 --> 01:00:09,973
I miss my wife.

1192
01:00:09,975 --> 01:00:12,775
I don't miss any of my husbands.

1193
01:00:12,777 --> 01:00:15,344
Although Bradley
<i>was</i> handy with a jack.

1194
01:00:15,346 --> 01:00:16,945
He had to be.

1195
01:00:16,947 --> 01:00:19,714
I don't wanna ask why.

1196
01:00:19,716 --> 01:00:21,882
His tires were bald.

1197
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:30,423
His tires were bald.

1198
01:00:30,425 --> 01:00:32,458
So was his head.

1199
01:00:33,561 --> 01:00:36,661
I wish he'd call,
but now he's dead.

1200
01:00:39,165 --> 01:00:41,465
He's not dead,
and he wasn't bald.

1201
01:00:42,301 --> 01:00:44,034
Poetic license.

1202
01:00:44,036 --> 01:00:46,569
¶ His tires were bald ¶

1203
01:00:46,571 --> 01:00:48,871
¶ and they went flat ¶

1204
01:00:48,873 --> 01:00:51,139
¶ so did our love ¶

1205
01:00:51,141 --> 01:00:53,040
¶ and that was ¶

1206

¶ that ¶

1207
01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:01,181
Maybe you could write
a song about my wife.

1208
01:01:01,183 --> 01:01:02,782
Do you love her?

1209
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:04,183
Oh-ho.

1210
01:01:04,185 --> 01:01:06,185
Hey, she drives me wild.

1211
01:01:06,187 --> 01:01:07,386
Mmm.

1212
01:01:07,388 --> 01:01:09,321
What about her?

1213
01:01:12,192 --> 01:01:14,192
She had her lips done.

1214
01:01:14,194 --> 01:01:16,794
Had little bits of fat

1215
01:01:16,796 --> 01:01:18,829
squeezed into them.

1216
01:01:18,831 --> 01:01:21,998
Now my wife has lips
like a blowfish...

1217
01:01:23,201 --> 01:01:24,800
But in a good way.

1218
01:01:24,802 --> 01:01:25,867
Mmm.

1219
01:01:27,203 --> 01:01:28,802
¶ My wife ¶

1220
01:01:28,804 --> 01:01:29,936

I... I don't see it,

1223
01:01:35,209 --> 01:01:37,209
but you know, I could be wrong.

1224
01:01:37,211 --> 01:01:39,010
If I had any talent
as a country singer,

1225
01:01:39,012 --> 01:01:41,612
I wouldn't be sitting
on the side of the road

1226
01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:43,480
in the middle of nowhere.

1227
01:01:48,786 --> 01:01:51,219
¶ Sittin' on the side

¶ in the middle of nowhere ¶

1229
01:01:55,358 --> 01:01:57,725
Sounds awfully familiar.

1230
01:01:57,727 --> 01:02:00,494
Mmm. But it's good, though.

1231
01:02:05,633 --> 01:02:07,633
This is one godforsaken road.

1232
01:02:07,635 --> 01:02:10,902
I'll bet you no one ever comes down it.

1233
01:02:22,648 --> 01:02:25,515
Yeah, well, they won't stop, though.

1234
01:02:32,857 --> 01:02:33,989
Hi there.

1235
01:02:33,991 --> 01:02:36,825
Bet you need a jack.

1236
01:02:39,129 --> 01:02:41,129
I spun around,

1237
01:02:41,131 --> 01:02:42,663
and the next thing that happened

1238
01:02:42,665 --> 01:02:44,665
was he came as 100 mouths,

1239
01:02:44,667 --> 01:02:46,066
open and stinking with decay,

1240
01:02:46,068 --> 01:02:49,069
and he tore at my flesh
from every angle of heaven.

1241
01:02:49,071 --> 01:02:51,838
So I grabbed beelzebub's
blue tongue in my fist.

1242
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:52,538
Whoa, man.

1243
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:54,540
Who's beelzebub?

1244
01:02:54,542 --> 01:02:56,808
Beelzebub is Satan.

1245
01:02:56,810 --> 01:02:58,176
Oh.

1246
01:02:58,178 --> 01:02:59,443
Satan.

1247
01:03:00,179 --> 01:03:02,779
Michael, get in the car.

1248
01:03:15,992 --> 01:03:18,325

What'll it be, folks?

01:03:27,201 --> 01:03:29,201
Do you have pie?

1255
01:03:29,203 --> 01:03:31,002
Do we have pie?

1256
01:03:31,004 --> 01:03:33,871
Buddy, you're in the 
pie capital of America.

1257
01:03:33,873 --> 01:03:35,806
Well, we want...

1258
01:03:35,808 --> 01:03:37,073
We want pie.

1259
01:03:37,075 --> 01:03:38,340
What have you got?

1260
01:03:38,342 --> 01:03:39,874
I got them memorized.

1261
01:03:39,876 --> 01:03:40,674
Ok, ready?

1262
01:03:40,676 --> 01:03:42,676
We got apple, of course,

1263
01:03:42,678 --> 01:03:44,611
banana cream, coconut cream,

1264
01:03:44,613 --> 01:03:46,212
sour cream raisin...

1265
01:03:46,214 --> 01:03:48,214
Chocolate cream?

1266
01:03:48,216 --> 01:03:50,816
Definitely chocolate cream.

1267
01:03:50,818 --> 01:03:52,450
And...

1268
01:03:52,452 --> 01:03:54,051
strawberry-rhubarb pie

1269
01:03:54,053 --> 01:03:56,353

1270
01:03:56,355 --> 01:03:58,487
and lemon meringue...

1271
01:04:00,591 --> 01:04:03,224
We want 2 slices of everything.

1272
01:04:03,226 --> 01:04:05,826
And vanilla ice cream on the side.

1273
01:04:05,828 --> 01:04:07,227
You got it.

1274
01:04:07,229 --> 01:04:08,361

Mmm. Ooh.

1282
01:04:26,945 --> 01:04:28,344
Ahh. Bliss.

Bliss.

That's banana cream
and that's coconut.

1285
01:04:31,148 --> 01:04:33,615
Everybody get out of
my banana cream pie.

01:04:34,618 --> 01:04:36,017
That's... that's the pie.

1288
01:04:36,019 --> 01:04:37,885
What's is this?
What is this pie?

1289
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:39,786
This is sour cream-raisin.
Very underrated pie.

1290
01:04:39,788 --> 01:04:41,387
Lemon meringue pie.

1291
01:04:41,389 --> 01:04:43,622
This is the key lime.

1292
01:04:43,624 --> 01:04:45,123
Mm-mmm. Lemon meringue.

1293
01:04:45,125 --> 01:04:46,691
What is it about pie?

1294
01:04:46,693 --> 01:04:48,092
It's pretty, you know?

1295
01:04:48,094 --> 01:04:49,760
There's nothing prettier than pie,

1296
01:04:49,762 --> 01:04:51,762
with the little scalloped edges around the sides

1297
01:04:51,764 --> 01:04:53,764
and little slits in the top
for the heat to escape.

1298
01:04:53,766 --> 01:04:55,365
Pie gives you the sense

1299
01:04:55,367 --> 01:04:56,966
that you're a four-square person

1300
01:04:56,968 --> 01:04:59,034
living in a four-square country.

1301
01:04:59,036 --> 01:05:00,368
Well, pie says home.

1302
01:05:00,370 --> 01:05:01,669
As american as apple pie.

1303
01:05:01,671 --> 01:05:03,137
I wish I invented pie.

1304
01:05:03,139 --> 01:05:05,038
I did.

1305
01:05:08,376 --> 01:05:10,042
I'm just kidding.

1306
01:05:11,378 --> 01:05:13,010
That was a good one.

1307
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:17,481
God's in his heaven,
and all's right with the world.

1308
01:05:17,483 --> 01:05:20,383
Mmm. My mother made a great...

1309
01:05:20,385 --> 01:05:22,651
Blueberry pie.

1310
01:05:23,987 --> 01:05:25,386
Yes.

1311
01:05:25,388 --> 01:05:27,287
So do I.

1312
01:05:27,289 --> 01:05:29,422
I have to say I like cream pie

1313
01:05:29,424 --> 01:05:31,190
more than fruit pie.

1314
01:05:31,192 --> 01:05:32,391
Me, too.

1315
01:05:32,393 --> 01:05:34,393
That is so wrong.

1316
01:05:34,395 --> 01:05:36,261
I like them all.

1317
01:05:36,263 --> 01:05:37,862
I like you.

1318
01:05:37,864 --> 01:05:38,929
Mmm.

1319
01:05:40,399 --> 01:05:41,798
Dorothy...

1320
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:44,200
Sing your song about pie.

1321
01:05:45,403 --> 01:05:48,069
You have a song about pie?

1322
01:05:49,005 --> 01:05:50,671
Actually, I do.

1323
01:05:51,407 --> 01:05:53,006
Sing, Dorothy.

1324
01:05:53,008 --> 01:05:54,840
Now.

1325
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:57,409
¶ Pie ¶

1326
01:05:57,411 --> 01:05:58,410
¶ pie ¶

1327
01:05:58,412 --> 01:05:59,778
¶ me, oh, my ¶

1328
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:02,680
¶ nothing tastes sweet,
wet, salty, and dry ¶

1329
01:06:02,682 --> 01:06:05,382
¶ all at once so well as pie ¶

1330
01:06:05,384 --> 01:06:06,549
¶ apple, pumpkin ¶

1331
01:06:06,551 --> 01:06:08,117
¶ mince and black bottom ¶

1332
01:06:08,119 --> 01:06:10,352
¶ I'll come to your place every day ¶

1333
01:06:10,354 --> 01:06:11,686
¶ if you've got 'em ¶

1334
01:06:11,688 --> 01:06:13,821
¶ pie, me, oh, my ¶

1335
01:06:13,823 --> 01:06:16,056
¶ I love pie ¶

1336
01:06:19,561 --> 01:06:21,027
That's great.

1337
01:06:22,296 --> 01:06:23,962
Sing another song.

1338
01:06:25,165 --> 01:06:26,831
Ohh.

1339
01:06:27,834 --> 01:06:29,433
It's, um, it's in B-flat.

1340
01:06:29,435 --> 01:06:30,767
It's pretty basic,

1341
01:06:30,769 --> 01:06:33,969
but watch out for the guitar
down there, ok?

1342
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:38,039
Ahem.

1343
01:06:38,041 --> 01:06:39,173
Oh.

1344
01:06:40,176 --> 01:06:41,341
Ahem. Hi.

1345
01:06:41,343 --> 01:06:42,342
I'm nervous.

1346
01:06:42,344 --> 01:06:43,976
Oh, this is, uh...

1347
01:06:43,978 --> 01:06:45,978
you'll have to forgive me.

1348
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:47,846
It's a work in progress.

1349
01:06:47,848 --> 01:06:49,447
Don't apologize, Dorothy.

1350
01:06:49,449 --> 01:06:50,448
Ok.

1351
01:06:50,450 --> 01:06:51,449
Ok.

1352
01:06:51,451 --> 01:06:53,951
1, 2, 3

1353
01:06:55,888 --> 01:06:59,489
¶ I'm sittin' by the side of the road ¶

1354
01:06:59,491 --> 01:07:02,825
¶ in the middle of nowhere ¶

1355
01:07:04,128 --> 01:07:06,862
¶ I don't know where I'm going ¶

1356
01:07:06,864 --> 01:07:09,464
¶ but I hope I know it ¶

1357
01:07:09,466 --> 01:07:11,833
¶ when I get there ¶

1358
01:07:11,835 --> 01:07:13,467
¶ thinkin' about ¶

1359
01:07:13,469 --> 01:07:15,869
¶ how love never works out ¶

1360
01:07:15,871 --> 01:07:18,872
¶ I guess that's the way it goes ¶

1361
01:07:18,874 --> 01:07:22,008
¶ and how this story ends ¶

1362
01:07:22,010 --> 01:07:25,311
¶ only heaven knows ¶

1363
01:07:26,647 --> 01:07:28,613
¶ I always thought ¶

1364
01:07:28,615 --> 01:07:30,881
¶ there was an angel ¶

1365
01:07:30,883 --> 01:07:34,251
¶ watchin' over me ¶

1366
01:07:34,253 --> 01:07:36,486
¶ but even angels ¶

1367
01:07:36,488 --> 01:07:39,021
¶ sometimes make mistakes ¶

1368
01:07:39,023 --> 01:07:41,456
¶ as you will see ¶

1369
01:07:41,458 --> 01:07:43,491
¶ 'cause I've had my share ¶

1370
01:07:43,493 --> 01:07:45,493
¶ of bad love affairs ¶

1371
01:07:45,495 --> 01:07:46,494
¶ in fact ¶

1372
01:07:46,496 --> 01:07:48,496
¶ I married 3 ¶

1373
01:07:49,265 --> 01:07:51,898
¶ so here's my little story ¶

1374
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:54,333
¶ about Myles ¶

1375
01:07:54,335 --> 01:07:56,935
¶ Ralph and Bradley ¶

1376
01:07:56,937 --> 01:08:00,038
¶ Myles made me smile ¶

1377
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:03,907
¶ till he stole my Camaro ¶

1378
01:08:04,809 --> 01:08:07,242
¶ Ralph made me laugh ¶

1379
01:08:07,244 --> 01:08:10,310
¶ till I cried ¶

1380
01:08:11,513 --> 01:08:13,513
¶ and Bradley ¶

1381
01:08:13,515 --> 01:08:17,249
¶ oh, I loved him madly ¶

1382
01:08:18,518 --> 01:08:20,918
¶ but his tires were bald ¶

1383
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:22,586
¶ and they went flat ¶

1384
01:08:22,588 --> 01:08:24,521
¶ so did our love ¶

1385
01:08:24,523 --> 01:08:27,290
¶ and that was that ¶

1386
01:08:27,292 --> 01:08:30,526
¶ now I'm sittin' in the middle of nowhere ¶

1387
01:08:30,528 --> 01:08:33,428
¶ by the side of the road ¶

1388
01:08:34,964 --> 01:08:36,930
¶ one of these days ¶

1389
01:08:36,932 --> 01:08:38,765
¶ I'll find true love ¶

1390
01:08:38,767 --> 01:08:41,467
¶ and learn how to say no ¶

1391
01:08:42,536 --> 01:08:44,536
¶ I know in the past ¶

1392
01:08:44,538 --> 01:08:46,337
¶ my love didn't last ¶

1393
01:08:46,339 --> 01:08:49,273
¶ as I guess this story shows ¶

1394
01:08:49,275 --> 01:08:52,676
¶ where was
my angel then? ¶

1395
01:08:52,678 --> 01:08:55,345
¶ only heaven knows ¶

1396
01:08:56,948 --> 01:09:00,181
¶ where was
my angel then? ¶

1397
01:09:00,950 --> 01:09:04,151
¶ only heaven ¶

1398
01:09:04,153 --> 01:09:07,187
¶ knows ¶

1399
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:13,225
Yeah!

1400
01:09:13,227 --> 01:09:14,659
Whoo!

1401
01:09:14,661 --> 01:09:15,760
Whoo!

1402
01:09:31,977 --> 01:09:34,577
And then when I went 
to college I was published.

1403
01:09:34,579 --> 01:09:35,978
You were published?

1404
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:37,579
Yeah, I was published.

1405
01:09:37,581 --> 01:09:38,613
Well, kind of.

1406
01:09:38,615 --> 01:09:40,181
It's was like a yearly thing.

1407
01:09:40,183 --> 01:09:41,182
Poems, you know?

1408
01:09:41,184 --> 01:09:42,183
That's great.

1409
01:09:42,185 --> 01:09:43,184
That's great.

1410
01:09:43,186 --> 01:09:43,984
Uh-huh.

1411
01:09:43,986 --> 01:09:45,585
That's really great.

1412
01:09:45,587 --> 01:09:46,586
Ahh, it's cold.

1413
01:09:46,588 --> 01:09:47,587
Yeah.

1414
01:09:47,589 --> 01:09:48,988
I'm in there.

1415
01:09:48,990 --> 01:09:50,856
This is Huey's room.

1416
01:09:51,592 --> 01:09:52,824
Where are you?

1417
01:09:52,826 --> 01:09:55,193
I'm in 4.

1418
01:09:55,195 --> 01:09:56,594
Where is that?

1419
01:09:56,596 --> 01:09:58,362
It's up there.

1420
01:09:59,598 --> 01:10:00,597
Where exactly?

1421
01:10:00,599 --> 01:10:01,998
On the corner.

1422
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,599
On the corner right there?

1423
01:10:03,601 --> 01:10:04,700
Directly over my room?

1424
01:10:04,702 --> 01:10:06,234
Uh...

1425
01:10:06,236 --> 01:10:07,568
Mm-hmm.

1426
01:10:09,238 --> 01:10:10,637
Um...

1427
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:12,639
You were great.

1428
01:10:12,641 --> 01:10:14,240
Really great.

1429
01:10:14,242 --> 01:10:15,641
Um...

1430
01:10:15,643 --> 01:10:16,642
Ahem.

1431
01:10:16,644 --> 01:10:17,643
It was...

1432
01:10:17,645 --> 01:10:19,244
Good night.

1433
01:10:19,246 --> 01:10:20,912
Yeah. Good night.

1434
01:10:21,648 --> 01:10:22,913
Ahem.

1435
01:10:24,249 --> 01:10:25,915
It was...

1436
01:10:26,651 --> 01:10:28,050
Mm-hmm.

1437
01:10:29,186 --> 01:10:32,787
¶ Something in your eyes ¶

1438
01:10:32,789 --> 01:10:36,323
¶ makes me want to lose myself ¶

1439
01:10:37,659 --> 01:10:41,193
¶ makes me want to lose myself ¶

1440
01:10:42,829 --> 01:10:45,596
¶ in your arms ¶

1441
01:10:48,067 --> 01:10:50,467
¶ something in your... ¶

1442
01:10:50,469 --> 01:10:53,269
What are... what are...
what are you doing tonight?

1443
01:10:53,271 --> 01:10:54,670
Not much.

1444
01:10:54,672 --> 01:10:56,672
Do you wanna come to my room?

1445
01:10:56,674 --> 01:10:59,274
Why don't you come to mine?

1446
01:10:59,276 --> 01:11:00,675
That's...

1447
01:11:00,677 --> 01:11:02,076
That's a good idea.

1448
01:11:02,078 --> 01:11:04,478
¶ The rest of my life ¶

1449
01:11:06,548 --> 01:11:09,081
¶ if you knew ¶

1450
01:11:09,083 --> 01:11:11,784
¶ how lonely ¶

1451
01:11:11,786 --> 01:11:13,919
¶ my life ¶

1452
01:11:13,921 --> 01:11:15,654
¶ has been ¶

1453
01:11:15,656 --> 01:11:17,789
¶ and how low ¶

1454
01:11:17,791 --> 01:11:19,190
Whew.

1455
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:21,392
¶ I've felt ¶

1456
01:11:21,394 --> 01:11:24,327
¶ so long ¶

1457
01:11:25,797 --> 01:11:28,197
¶ if you knew ¶

1458
01:11:28,199 --> 01:11:31,533
¶ how I wanted someone ¶

1459
01:11:31,535 --> 01:11:35,803
¶ to come along ¶

1460
01:11:35,805 --> 01:11:38,205
¶ and change... ¶

1461
01:11:38,207 --> 01:11:40,407
I have to tell you something.

1462
01:11:40,409 --> 01:11:41,408
I know.

1463
01:11:41,410 --> 01:11:42,375
I'm not...

1464
01:11:42,377 --> 01:11:44,410
Ever falling in love
with anyone again.

1465
01:11:44,412 --> 01:11:45,210
I know.

1466
01:11:45,212 --> 01:11:47,812
¶ Feels like home ¶

1467
01:11:47,814 --> 01:11:49,213
¶ to me ¶

1468
01:11:49,215 --> 01:11:52,815
¶ feels like home ¶

1469
01:11:52,817 --> 01:11:54,216
¶ to me ¶

1470
01:11:54,218 --> 01:11:55,217
¶ feels like ¶

1471
01:11:55,219 --> 01:11:58,220
¶ I'm all the way back ¶

1472
01:11:58,222 --> 01:12:02,090
¶ where I come from ¶

1473
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:06,927

¶ all the way back ¶

¶ where I belong ¶

1480
01:12:34,984 --> 01:12:36,583
Ok, ok.

1481
01:12:36,585 --> 01:12:37,850
Ohh.

1482
01:12:37,852 --> 01:12:39,685
Ok, ok.

1483
01:13:31,503 --> 01:13:32,902
Come on, Sparky.

1484
01:13:32,904 --> 01:13:33,903
Come on.

1485
01:13:33,905 --> 01:13:35,905
Come on, boy.

1486
01:13:35,907 --> 01:13:37,506
Yes.

1487
01:13:37,508 --> 01:13:39,508
Wings?

1488
01:13:39,510 --> 01:13:41,510
Far out!

1489
01:13:41,512 --> 01:13:42,911
Ha ha!

1490
01:13:42,913 --> 01:13:44,445
Some angel.

1491
01:13:54,056 --> 01:13:56,122
¶ I see trees ¶

1492
01:13:56,124 --> 01:13:58,257
¶ of green ¶

1493
01:13:58,259 --> 01:14:00,726
¶ red roses, too ¶

1494
01:14:01,729 --> 01:14:04,329
¶ I see them bloom ¶

1495
01:14:04,331 --> 01:14:07,932
¶ for me and you ¶

1496
01:14:07,934 --> 01:14:11,334
¶ and I think to myself ¶

1497
01:14:12,804 --> 01:14:16,605
¶ what a wonderful world ¶

1498
01:14:19,343 --> 01:14:20,942
¶ what a wonderful world ¶

1499
01:14:20,944 --> 01:14:22,877
¶ I see skies ¶

1500
01:14:22,879 --> 01:14:24,678
¶ of blue ¶

1501
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:26,212
¶ and clouds ¶

1502
01:14:26,214 --> 01:14:28,214
¶ of white ¶

1503
01:14:28,216 --> 01:14:31,083
¶ the bright blessed days ¶

1504
01:14:31,085 --> 01:14:34,352
¶ from the dark sacred nights ¶

1505
01:14:34,354 --> 01:14:38,922
¶ and I think to myself ¶

1506
01:14:38,924 --> 01:14:43,493
¶ what a wonderful world ¶

1507
01:14:46,998 --> 01:14:52,534
¶ and I think to myself ¶

1508
01:14:53,336 --> 01:14:55,703
¶ What a wonderful ¶

1509
01:14:55,705 --> 01:14:57,638
¶ world ¶

1510
01:15:02,578 --> 01:15:04,644
I needed the job.

1511
01:15:10,985 --> 01:15:12,684
Good morning.

1512
01:15:12,686 --> 01:15:16,654
What exactly are we
talking about here?

1513
01:15:17,590 --> 01:15:18,789
At the paper.

1514
01:15:18,791 --> 01:15:21,391
That's what I was trying
to tell you last night.

1515
01:15:21,393 --> 01:15:22,992
That's why I'm here.

1516
01:15:22,994 --> 01:15:24,994
I don't make excuses
for working there.

1517
01:15:24,996 --> 01:15:27,663
There's no reason for you to.

1518
01:15:31,868 --> 01:15:34,001
Here's a confession.

1519
01:15:34,003 --> 01:15:36,003
You wanna hear a confession?

1520
01:15:36,005 --> 01:15:37,404
Yours?

1521
01:15:37,406 --> 01:15:40,473
I needed the job, too.

1522
01:15:40,475 --> 01:15:41,407
Huh.

1523
01:15:41,409 --> 01:15:43,409
No one would go near me

1524
01:15:43,411 --> 01:15:45,144
after what happened at the<i> tribune.</i>

1525
01:15:45,146 --> 01:15:47,513
What did happen?

1526
01:15:47,515 --> 01:15:48,680
Oh.

1527
01:15:49,849 --> 01:15:52,816
I hit the managing editor.

1528
01:15:52,818 --> 01:15:54,350
Why?

1529
01:15:54,352 --> 01:15:57,353
He fired this really sweet old guy

1530
01:15:57,355 --> 01:15:59,955
who'd been there
for, like, 27 years.

1531
01:16:00,691 --> 01:16:02,157
Really?

1532
01:16:02,159 --> 01:16:03,825
Nope.

1533
01:16:05,161 --> 01:16:07,961
He changed my lead.

1534
01:16:07,963 --> 01:16:10,163
You hit him...

1535
01:16:10,165 --> 01:16:13,166
Because he changed your lead?

1536
01:16:13,168 --> 01:16:14,834
No.

1537
01:16:16,337 --> 01:16:19,704
It was late.
I was drunk.

1538
01:16:22,175 --> 01:16:23,307
The way I see it,

1539
01:16:23,309 --> 01:16:25,175
it makes no difference where I work.

1540
01:16:25,177 --> 01:16:27,177
That's what I call a lie.

1541
01:16:27,179 --> 01:16:29,312
I bet you have a half-finished novel

1542
01:16:29,314 --> 01:16:31,881
in the second drawer of your desk.

1543
01:16:31,883 --> 01:16:33,716
She got the desk.

1544
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:37,519
Are you keeping something from me?

1545
01:16:41,724 --> 01:16:43,557
I'm not ethical.

1546
01:16:43,559 --> 01:16:46,159
Just because you write about angels

1547
01:16:46,161 --> 01:16:48,427
for a supermarket tabloid?

1548
01:16:52,932 --> 01:16:57,801
Are you keeping some 
angel experience from me?

1549
01:16:59,137 --> 01:17:01,803
If you are, I forgive you.

1550
01:17:03,139 --> 01:17:05,405
I could forgive you anything.

1551
01:17:09,277 --> 01:17:10,943
This was not a mistake.

1552
01:17:10,945 --> 01:17:13,412
Don't say that you think
this was a mistake.

1553
01:17:13,414 --> 01:17:14,813
I couldn't bear it.

1554
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:29,026
¶ We're here ¶

1555
01:17:29,028 --> 01:17:31,428
¶ because we're here ¶

1556
01:17:31,430 --> 01:17:34,164
¶ because we're here ¶

1557
01:17:34,166 --> 01:17:37,433
¶ because we're here ¶

1558
01:17:40,171 --> 01:17:42,303
It's going well.

1559
01:17:44,573 --> 01:17:47,173
It's a difficult case, though,

1560
01:17:47,175 --> 01:17:50,309
to give a man back his heart.

1561
01:17:54,915 --> 01:17:56,915
Mmm.

1562
01:17:56,917 --> 01:17:58,616
Listen.

1563
01:17:59,952 --> 01:18:03,987
Ooh... Listen to the earth.

1564
01:18:11,796 --> 01:18:13,195
Mmm.

1565
01:18:13,197 --> 01:18:16,331
I'm going to miss
everything so much.

1566
01:18:26,475 --> 01:18:28,074
You got to remember, Sparky,

1567
01:18:28,076 --> 01:18:30,076
no matter what they tell you,

1568
01:18:30,078 --> 01:18:32,745
you can never
have too much sugar.

1569
01:18:46,827 --> 01:18:48,226
Dorothy.

1570
01:18:48,228 --> 01:18:49,760
Quinlan.

1571
01:18:51,497 --> 01:18:53,830
Good morning, Michael.

1572
01:18:53,832 --> 01:18:55,865
Good morning, Sparky.

1573
01:19:03,306 --> 01:19:04,571
Sparky, no!

1574
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:08,441
No!

1575
01:19:09,310 --> 01:19:11,443
Ohh!

1576
01:19:18,651 --> 01:19:21,852
Oh, he's all right.
He's all right.

1577
01:19:21,854 --> 01:19:23,386
Ohh!

1578
01:19:25,857 --> 01:19:27,923
He's all right.

1579
01:19:27,925 --> 01:19:29,658
No.

1580
01:19:29,660 --> 01:19:31,860
Ohh.

1581
01:19:31,862 --> 01:19:34,262
Oh, I killed him.

1582
01:19:34,264 --> 01:19:35,863
It's not your fault.

1583
01:19:35,865 --> 01:19:37,264
It's all my fault.

1584
01:19:37,266 --> 01:19:38,932
I'm so sorry, Huey.

1585
01:19:44,672 --> 01:19:46,772
I'm so sorry.

1586
01:19:57,217 --> 01:20:00,117
You didn't do anything wrong.

1587
01:20:12,898 --> 01:20:14,964
Do something.

1588
01:20:14,966 --> 01:20:16,899
It isn't my area.

1589
01:20:16,901 --> 01:20:20,435
What is your area?
Explain it to me.

1590
01:20:20,437 --> 01:20:25,706
Would somebody tell me
exactly what is his area?

1591
01:20:25,708 --> 01:20:27,841
I don't know anything
about his area.

1592
01:20:27,843 --> 01:20:30,710
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

1593
01:20:30,712 --> 01:20:31,911
What?

1594
01:20:31,913 --> 01:20:34,914
I don't know anything about angels.

1595
01:20:34,916 --> 01:20:39,151
I'm a dog trainer.
That's why I was hired.

1596
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:43,087
To train Sparky?

1597
01:20:43,089 --> 01:20:44,088
And then...

1598
01:20:44,090 --> 01:20:45,355
then after...

1599
01:20:45,357 --> 01:20:49,992
We screw up with the angel,
and Malt gets the dog...

1600
01:20:51,428 --> 01:20:53,961
I get Huey's job.

1601
01:20:56,131 --> 01:20:58,030
I didn't know you.

1602
01:21:01,368 --> 01:21:04,168
I'm sorry.

1603
01:21:05,304 --> 01:21:07,270
I'm sorry, too.

1604
01:21:10,842 --> 01:21:14,743
Now bring him back to life.

1605
01:21:14,745 --> 01:21:17,479
And don't give me any of that 
"it isn't my area" stuff.

1606
01:21:17,481 --> 01:21:19,981
Bring him back to life

1607
01:21:19,983 --> 01:21:23,718
or go back where you came from.

1608
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:25,986
Bring him back...

1609
01:21:29,057 --> 01:21:30,856
Angel.

1610
01:24:01,003 --> 01:24:04,170
I don't have much longer.

1611
01:24:37,638 --> 01:24:39,304
Ohh.

1612
01:24:40,373 --> 01:24:42,172
Ohh.

1613
01:24:54,218 --> 01:24:55,750
Ohh.

1614
01:24:59,655 --> 01:25:00,820
Ohh.

1615
01:25:19,072 --> 01:25:21,472
We're here, Michael.
We're here.

1616
01:25:31,684 --> 01:25:34,484
Michael, look up.

1617
01:25:37,222 --> 01:25:41,223
"The sears tower in Chicago 
is the world's tallest building.

1618
01:25:41,225 --> 01:25:44,559
"It stands 1,454 feet above street level,

1619
01:25:44,561 --> 01:25:49,797
contains enough concrete
for an 8-Lane highway."

1620
01:25:52,001 --> 01:25:53,400
Ohh.

1621
01:25:53,402 --> 01:25:55,869
Ohh.

1622
01:25:57,005 --> 01:25:58,337
Ahh.

1623
01:25:59,106 --> 01:26:01,706
Quinlan, I'm so sorry.

1624
01:26:01,708 --> 01:26:04,508
I didn't do what I came for.

1625
01:26:05,611 --> 01:26:07,477
I didn't finish.

1626
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:12,280
I'm so sorry.

1627
01:26:14,550 --> 01:26:17,383
Um...

1628
01:26:18,686 --> 01:26:20,419
Good-bye.

1629
01:26:20,421 --> 01:26:22,154
Good-bye, Michael.

1630
01:26:22,156 --> 01:26:24,156
Thank you for everything.

1631
01:26:24,158 --> 01:26:27,092
Thank you for letting me have a little fun.

1632
01:26:27,094 --> 01:26:30,695
Good-bye, my battling friend.

1633
01:26:30,697 --> 01:26:33,297
Good-bye, world's biggest angel.

1634
01:26:33,299 --> 01:26:35,699
Godspeed.

1635
01:26:35,701 --> 01:26:37,600
Ohh.

1636
01:27:58,515 --> 01:27:59,614
You're late.

1637
01:27:59,616 --> 01:28:00,781
I know.

1638
01:28:00,783 --> 01:28:02,182
Where's the angel?

1639
01:28:02,184 --> 01:28:04,651
Yeah, it was a hoax.

1640
01:28:04,653 --> 01:28:05,852
A hoax?

1641
01:28:05,854 --> 01:28:07,286
A hoax.
Definitely a hoax.

1642
01:28:07,288 --> 01:28:08,787
He had detachable wings.

1643
01:28:08,789 --> 01:28:10,789
And a halo made out of pipe cleaners.

1644
01:28:10,791 --> 01:28:12,757
And he smelled of cookies.

1645
01:28:12,759 --> 01:28:13,758
Just kidding.

1646
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:16,360
So, I win.

1647
01:28:16,362 --> 01:28:18,562
You're fired,

1648
01:28:18,564 --> 01:28:20,964
and I get the dog.
Ha ha.

1649
01:28:20,966 --> 01:28:22,565
Come here, Sparky.

1650
01:28:22,567 --> 01:28:24,567
Come on, my little sausage.

1651
01:28:24,569 --> 01:28:26,101
You come to your daddy.

1652
01:28:26,103 --> 01:28:27,769
Come on... ow!

1653
01:28:27,771 --> 01:28:28,936
Bastard!

1654
01:28:28,938 --> 01:28:30,837
Sparky, come on.

1655
01:28:30,839 --> 01:28:32,038
Listen, Sparky...

1656
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:33,072
Sparky!

1657
01:28:33,074 --> 01:28:35,808
Don't hate me.
I love you... ow!

1658
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:37,209
Oh, gee.

1659
01:28:37,211 --> 01:28:39,211
Hey, listen, get the mutt out, will you?

1660
01:28:39,213 --> 01:28:41,213
Oh, right. 
Like that dog could be gotten out,

1661
01:28:41,215 --> 01:28:42,614
like that dog can do anything.

1662
01:28:42,616 --> 01:28:44,582
That is the worst dog
I think I've ever met.

1663
01:28:44,584 --> 01:28:46,517
I thought you said
you could train any dog.

1664
01:28:46,519 --> 01:28:47,851
She was wrong.

1665
01:28:47,853 --> 01:28:50,620
Are you saying I'm stuck with 
these two because of a dog?

1666
01:28:50,622 --> 01:28:53,623
You're stuck with Mr. Driscoll, not with me.

1667
01:28:53,625 --> 01:28:56,959
We met a guy with a 2-headed chicken
outside of cedar rapids.

1668
01:28:56,961 --> 01:28:58,994
Yeah. Yeah.

1669
01:28:58,996 --> 01:29:00,595
Hey, where are you going?

1670
01:29:00,597 --> 01:29:02,597
Hey! Quinlan!

1671
01:29:02,599 --> 01:29:04,565
Hey! Hey, Quinlan!

1672
01:29:04,567 --> 01:29:06,433
Where are you going?

1673
01:29:06,435 --> 01:29:08,568
Hey! Get off of me!

1674
01:29:08,570 --> 01:29:10,970
Get... get back!

1675
01:29:10,972 --> 01:29:13,072
Listen, Quinlan, forget
what I said. Don't...

1676
01:29:13,074 --> 01:29:14,840
don't take it personally.

1677
01:29:14,842 --> 01:29:16,708
You're the best reporter I have.

1678
01:29:16,710 --> 01:29:18,109
I'm out of here.

1679
01:29:18,945 --> 01:29:20,411
Hey!

1680
01:29:25,851 --> 01:29:27,851
So you're just going to leave?

1681
01:29:27,853 --> 01:29:29,719
You don't want to talk about it?

1682
01:29:29,721 --> 01:29:30,953
Nope.

1683
01:29:30,955 --> 01:29:33,355
Hey, come on, talk to me, eh?

1684
01:29:33,357 --> 01:29:36,257
Well, disagree with me.
Argue me out of it.

1685
01:29:36,259 --> 01:29:37,992
All right, let's have a fight.

1686
01:29:37,994 --> 01:29:39,793
Come on, fight me, eh?

1687
01:29:39,795 --> 01:29:43,996
Hey, Quinlan, you're the only one
that ever fought with me here.

1688
01:29:43,998 --> 01:29:46,231
Well, who am I going to fight with?

1689
01:29:46,233 --> 01:29:47,832
You got to help me out here.

1690
01:29:47,834 --> 01:29:49,667
It isn't my area.

1691
01:29:49,669 --> 01:29:51,068
Wait!

1692
01:29:59,477 --> 01:30:00,876
I'm sorry.

1693
01:30:00,878 --> 01:30:03,278
Please stop.

1694
01:30:04,281 --> 01:30:07,282
Please stop and talk to me.

1695
01:30:07,284 --> 01:30:10,752
I appreciate what you said up there.
I thank you.

1696
01:30:10,754 --> 01:30:11,953
I'll see you around.

1697
01:30:11,955 --> 01:30:13,120
You said...

1698
01:30:13,122 --> 01:30:16,490
You said you could
forgive me anything.

1699
01:30:16,492 --> 01:30:18,492
I forgive you.

1700
01:30:18,494 --> 01:30:20,427
We had a good time.

1701
01:30:20,429 --> 01:30:22,629
What are you so upset about?

1702
01:30:22,631 --> 01:30:24,631
Oh.

1703
01:30:24,633 --> 01:30:26,465
It's you.

1704
01:30:28,502 --> 01:30:30,235
I remember you.

1705
01:30:30,237 --> 01:30:32,503
I thought you were gone.

1706
01:30:50,420 --> 01:30:53,921
¶ I took a trip on a train ¶

1707
01:30:53,923 --> 01:30:56,056
¶ and I thought about you ¶

1708
01:30:56,058 --> 01:30:58,458
Come on in, Rhoda.

1709
01:30:58,460 --> 01:31:01,394
¶ I passed a shadowy Lane ¶

1710
01:31:01,396 --> 01:31:05,730
¶ and I thought about you ¶

1711
01:31:06,666 --> 01:31:11,568
¶ 2 or 3 cars parked under the stars... ¶

1712
01:31:11,570 --> 01:31:13,570
Uh, good evening. <i>Buona sera.</i>

1713
01:31:13,572 --> 01:31:18,340
Um, for our specialties tonight, we... 
we have angel hair pasta

1714
01:31:18,342 --> 01:31:21,343
with a pomodoro sauce,

1715
01:31:21,345 --> 01:31:25,813
uh, cappellini primavera,
a melange of vegetables

1716
01:31:25,815 --> 01:31:28,115
over angel hair pasta,

1717
01:31:28,117 --> 01:31:33,086
and finally, a light sauce
with lemon and parsley

1718
01:31:33,088 --> 01:31:36,555
tossed with angel hair pasta.

1719
01:31:36,557 --> 01:31:37,489
Anything else?

1720
01:31:37,491 --> 01:31:40,558
Yes, we want one
pumpkin nut muffin,

1721
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:42,092
and...

1722
01:31:42,094 --> 01:31:44,494
A piece of angel food cake.

1723
01:31:44,496 --> 01:31:47,963
They don't have angel food cake, do you?

1724
01:31:47,965 --> 01:31:49,130
No.

1725
01:31:49,132 --> 01:31:51,132
¶ And what did I do? ¶

1726
01:31:51,134 --> 01:31:54,835
¶ I thought about you ¶

1727
01:32:00,375 --> 01:32:03,776
¶ and I thought about you ¶

1728
01:32:08,849 --> 01:32:12,116
¶ and I thought about you ¶

1729
01:32:12,118 --> 01:32:15,452
¶ there were 2 or 3 cars ¶

1730
01:32:15,454 --> 01:32:17,987
¶ parked under the stars ¶

1731
01:32:17,989 --> 01:32:20,656
¶ a winding stream ¶

1732
01:32:21,659 --> 01:32:23,859
¶ the moon shining down on ¶

1733
01:32:23,861 --> 01:32:25,393
¶ some little town ¶

1734
01:32:25,395 --> 01:32:27,762
¶ and with each beam ¶

1735
01:32:27,764 --> 01:32:30,730
¶ the same old dream ¶

1736
01:32:33,134 --> 01:32:38,403
¶ so I thought about you ¶

1737
01:32:42,108 --> 01:32:44,641
¶ and I really felt good ¶

1738
01:32:44,643 --> 01:32:47,644
¶ and then I'd peek through the crack ¶

1739
01:32:47,646 --> 01:32:50,380
¶ and I looked in that track ¶

1740
01:32:50,382 --> 01:32:53,983
¶ the one going back to you ¶

1741
01:32:53,985 --> 01:32:57,252
¶ and what did I do? ¶

1742
01:32:59,322 --> 01:33:04,591
¶ I thought about you ¶

1743
01:33:08,662 --> 01:33:12,530
So, did you ever
tell anyone about, uh...

1744
01:33:15,735 --> 01:33:17,301
I was going to.

1745
01:33:17,303 --> 01:33:21,304
Oh, I couldn't wait to get home to tell Valerie.

1746
01:33:21,306 --> 01:33:24,540
And then I opened my mouth,

1747
01:33:24,542 --> 01:33:27,342
and the words wouldn't come out.

1748
01:33:27,344 --> 01:33:31,913
I'd take a breath, I... I... 
I even opened my mouth a second time.

1749
01:33:31,915 --> 01:33:33,948
Nothing.

1750
01:33:34,850 --> 01:33:38,151
As far as I'm concerned,
it never happened.

1751
01:33:38,153 --> 01:33:39,886
Oh, but we saw it.

1752
01:33:39,888 --> 01:33:41,053
We were there.

1753
01:33:41,055 --> 01:33:43,188
It never happened.

1754
01:33:43,190 --> 01:33:45,557
So what are you up to?

1755
01:33:45,559 --> 01:33:47,692
I'm back on the novel.

1756
01:33:49,562 --> 01:33:51,929
If it didn't happen, where's your raincoat?

1757
01:33:51,931 --> 01:33:54,131
"If it..." what is this?
"If it happened?"

1758
01:33:54,133 --> 01:33:55,532
If it happened, you know what?

1759
01:33:55,534 --> 01:33:57,400
Then I've got to believe that someday

1760
01:33:57,402 --> 01:33:58,834
I'm going to be walking down the street

1761
01:33:58,836 --> 01:34:03,471
and some unknown force is
going to make me turn right

1762
01:34:03,473 --> 01:34:05,739
instead of turning left,

1763
01:34:05,741 --> 01:34:10,743
and, at that moment, a car is going 
to come around the corner

1764
01:34:10,745 --> 01:34:12,945
with the woman of my dreams in it

1765
01:34:12,947 --> 01:34:14,546
and blow a flat...

1766
01:34:17,717 --> 01:34:21,485
Right there, next to where I'm standing.

1767
01:34:23,522 --> 01:34:25,522
No.

1768
01:34:29,194 --> 01:34:30,993
It never happened.

1769
01:35:02,456 --> 01:35:05,223
Ha ha ha ha.

1770
01:35:05,225 --> 01:35:06,824
You need any help?

1771
01:35:06,826 --> 01:35:07,825
No, thanks.

1772
01:35:07,827 --> 01:35:09,126
No, we're cool.

1773
01:35:09,128 --> 01:35:10,727
Ha ha ha ha.

1774
01:36:48,358 --> 01:36:49,857
Michael!

1775
01:37:03,372 --> 01:37:05,105
Michael, wait!

1776
01:37:13,848 --> 01:37:15,180
Ohh!

1777
01:37:24,157 --> 01:37:25,689
What are you doing here?

1778
01:37:25,691 --> 01:37:29,458
I live here. I live 2 blocks from here.

1779
01:37:29,460 --> 01:37:32,327
I was on my way home and...

1780
01:37:32,329 --> 01:37:34,629
I thought I saw...

1781
01:37:34,631 --> 01:37:36,230
He came around this corner.

1782
01:37:36,232 --> 01:37:38,665
That corner.

1783
01:37:50,211 --> 01:37:52,511
I love you, Dorothy.

1784
01:37:54,414 --> 01:37:56,947
I love you.

1785
01:38:00,285 --> 01:38:02,218
Marry me.

1786
01:38:02,220 --> 01:38:04,720
No.

1787
01:38:05,723 --> 01:38:07,456
Marry me, please?

1788
01:38:07,458 --> 01:38:09,157
No.

1789
01:38:09,159 --> 01:38:11,893
Marry me, Dorothy.

1790
01:38:11,895 --> 01:38:13,027
No.

1791
01:38:13,029 --> 01:38:14,695
Ha ha ha ha.

1792
01:38:14,697 --> 01:38:17,564
Oh, my darling Dorothy,
will you marry me?

1793
01:38:17,566 --> 01:38:20,099
Yes. Yes.

1794
01:38:29,576 --> 01:38:31,709
Let's go home.

1795
01:38:48,727 --> 01:38:52,194
You know, Pansy,
I invented marriage.

1796
01:38:52,196 --> 01:38:53,328
Michael.

1797
01:38:53,330 --> 01:38:54,862
Well, I did.

1798
01:38:54,864 --> 01:38:57,130
Before that, you should have seen it.

1799
01:38:57,132 --> 01:38:59,732
Everybody was so mixed up,
they didn't know what to do.

1800
01:38:59,734 --> 01:39:02,935
So I said: "have a ceremony."

1801
01:39:02,937 --> 01:39:04,937
Hmm.

1802
01:39:04,939 --> 01:39:06,872
Let's go home.

1803
01:39:20,620 --> 01:39:22,620
¶ From the dark end of the street ¶

1804
01:39:22,622 --> 01:39:24,622
Do you smell something?

1805
01:39:24,624 --> 01:39:26,024
There's a bakery near here.

1806
01:39:26,025 --> 01:39:28,892
¶ To the bright side of the road ¶

1807
01:39:31,162 --> 01:39:33,795
¶ we'll be lovers once again ¶

1808
01:39:33,797 --> 01:39:37,131
¶ on the bright side of the road ¶

1809
01:39:41,770 --> 01:39:45,138
¶ little darlin', come with me ¶

1810
01:39:47,509 --> 01:39:50,309
¶ won't ya help me share my load? ¶

1811
01:39:52,780 --> 01:39:55,781
¶ from the dark end of the street ¶

1812
01:39:55,783 --> 01:39:58,917
¶ to the bright side of the road ¶

1813
01:40:02,055 --> 01:40:05,622
¶ and into this life we're born ¶

1814
01:40:07,425 --> 01:40:09,825
¶ baby, sometimes ¶

1815
01:40:09,827 --> 01:40:13,027
¶ sometimes we don't know why ¶

1816
01:40:14,196 --> 01:40:17,930
¶ and time seems to go by so fast ¶

1817
01:40:19,667 --> 01:40:23,201
¶ in the twinkling of an eye ¶

1818
01:40:25,538 --> 01:40:27,938
¶ let's enjoy it while we can ¶

1819
01:40:27,940 --> 01:40:30,941
¶ let's enjoy it while we can ¶

1820
01:40:30,943 --> 01:40:33,810
¶ won't ya help me share my load? ¶

1821
01:40:33,812 --> 01:40:36,212
¶ help me share my load ¶

1822
01:40:36,214 --> 01:40:39,215
¶ from the dark end of the street ¶

1823
01:40:39,217 --> 01:40:42,351
¶ to the bright side of the road ¶

1824
01:40:45,489 --> 01:40:47,489
¶ oh, we'll be ¶

1825
01:40:47,491 --> 01:40:49,891
¶ lovers once again ¶

1826
01:40:49,893 --> 01:40:53,160
¶ on the bright side of the road ¶

1827
01:41:02,469 --> 01:41:04,435
¶ We were dreamin' ¶

1828
01:41:04,437 --> 01:41:06,570
¶ on a park bench ¶

1829
01:41:06,572 --> 01:41:10,840
¶ about a broad highway somewhere ¶

1830
01:41:10,842 --> 01:41:12,842
¶ when the music ¶

1831
01:41:12,844 --> 01:41:14,844
¶ from the carillon ¶

1832
01:41:14,846 --> 01:41:18,980
¶ seemed to hurl your heart out there ¶

1833
01:41:18,982 --> 01:41:23,851
¶ that's the scientific darkness ¶

1834
01:41:23,853 --> 01:41:27,854
¶ that's the fireflies that float ¶

1835
01:41:27,856 --> 01:41:29,856
¶ to an angel ¶

1836
01:41:29,858 --> 01:41:36,462
¶ bending down to wrap you
in his warmest coat ¶

1837
01:41:36,464 --> 01:41:38,030
¶ and you ask ¶

1838
01:41:38,032 --> 01:41:40,632
¶ what am I not doing? ¶

1839
01:41:40,634 --> 01:41:44,735
¶ he says your voice cannot come in ¶

1840
01:41:44,737 --> 01:41:49,473
¶ but in time, you will move mountains ¶

1841
01:41:49,475 --> 01:41:52,876
¶ it will come ¶

1842
01:41:52,878 --> 01:41:56,012
¶ through your hands ¶

1843
01:42:01,886 --> 01:42:06,154
¶ so whatever your hands
find to do ¶

1844
01:42:06,156 --> 01:42:10,291
¶ you must do
with all your heart ¶

1845
01:42:10,293 --> 01:42:15,195
¶ there are thoughts enough
to blow men's minds ¶

1846
01:42:15,197 --> 01:42:19,065
¶ and tear great worlds apart ¶

1847
01:42:19,067 --> 01:42:23,301
¶ there's a healin' touch
to find you ¶

1848
01:42:23,303 --> 01:42:27,638
¶ on that broad highway
somewhere ¶

1849
01:42:27,640 --> 01:42:32,175
¶ to lift you
high as music flyin' ¶

1850
01:42:32,177 --> 01:42:35,912
¶ through the angel's hair ¶

1851
01:42:35,914 --> 01:42:39,915
¶ so don't ask
what you are not doin' ¶

1852
01:42:39,917 --> 01:42:44,653
¶ because your voice
cannot come in ¶

1853
01:42:44,655 --> 01:42:48,656
¶ in time, you will move mountains ¶

1854
01:42:48,658 --> 01:42:52,659
¶ it will come ¶

1855
01:42:52,661 --> 01:42:59,365
¶ through your hands ¶

1856
01:43:05,204 --> 01:43:07,204
¶ Now, ain't it a shame ¶

1857
01:43:07,206 --> 01:43:11,340
¶ all the tears
that people cry? ¶

1858
01:43:11,342 --> 01:43:16,277
¶ we ain't got it right
in all of these years ¶

1859
01:43:16,279 --> 01:43:17,945
Sorry, man.

1860
01:43:17,947 --> 01:43:20,547
¶ There must be a way ¶

1861
01:43:20,549 --> 01:43:24,350
¶ to live a better life ¶

1862
01:43:24,352 --> 01:43:29,554
¶ and break all these chains
and get out of here ¶

1863
01:43:29,556 --> 01:43:32,823
¶ you've got to love God ¶

1864
01:43:32,825 --> 01:43:36,060
¶ you've got to love yourself ¶

1865
01:43:36,062 --> 01:43:40,063
¶ you've got to
love your brothers ¶

1866
01:43:40,065 --> 01:43:42,465
¶ and everybody else ¶

1867
01:43:42,467 --> 01:43:45,468
¶ you've got to walk that walk ¶

1868
01:43:45,470 --> 01:43:49,071
¶ you can't just talk that talk ¶

1869
01:43:49,073 --> 01:43:52,941
¶ you've got to love God ¶

1870
01:43:52,943 --> 01:43:56,677
¶ and everybody else ¶

1871
01:43:56,679 --> 01:43:59,079
¶ heard some people say ¶

1872
01:43:59,081 --> 01:44:03,082
¶ that all we need is love ¶

1873
01:44:03,084 --> 01:44:05,084
¶ it sounds so simple ¶

1874
01:44:05,086 --> 01:44:08,220
¶ but it's true ¶

1875
01:44:09,690 --> 01:44:12,090
¶ well, maybe today ¶

1876
01:44:12,092 --> 01:44:16,093
¶ we will rain down love from above ¶

1877
01:44:16,095 --> 01:44:20,496
¶ and wash us clean
and make us new ¶

1878
01:44:20,498 --> 01:44:24,499
¶ but you've got to love God ¶

1879
01:44:24,501 --> 01:44:27,368
¶ you've got to love yourself ¶

1880
01:44:27,370 --> 01:44:31,705
¶ you've got to love,
love, love, love God ¶

1881
01:44:31,707 --> 01:44:34,708
¶ and everybody else ¶

1882
01:44:34,710 --> 01:44:37,711
¶ hey, I want to believe ¶

1883
01:44:37,713 --> 01:44:38,978
¶ I got to believe ¶

1884
01:44:38,980 --> 01:44:40,112
¶ want to be true ¶

1885
01:44:40,114 --> 01:44:42,114
¶ I want to be true ¶

1886
01:44:42,116 --> 01:44:44,116
¶ I want to see a miracle ¶

1887
01:44:44,118 --> 01:44:48,720
¶ I want you to see it, too ¶

1888
01:44:48,722 --> 01:44:50,722
¶ now ¶

1889
01:44:50,724 --> 01:44:52,123
¶ love God ¶

1890
01:44:52,125 --> 01:44:55,126
¶ I want to love my neighbor ¶

1891
01:44:55,128 --> 01:44:59,129
¶ you've got to love God ¶

1892
01:44:59,131 --> 01:45:03,833
¶ and everybody else... ¶
