just leave those here

a little fake and plasticky.

you could fix.

in fixing one eye.

need to fix this
is a brow-lift.

What is that exactly?

an incision right here

228

and then we
pull the skin back

Okay, I would like
to say something, too.
For real.

528
00:25:44,742 --> 00:25:47,609
No offense to
the lovely Agness or her
charming offspring...

529

(SNORTS)

530
00:25:49,246 --> 00:25:50,304
Not nice.

531
00:25:50,381 --> 00:25:51,405
Not nice.

532
00:25:51,916 --> 00:25:53,247
I know, I'm sorry.

533
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:57,286
But I just wanted to say,
I really loved today.

534
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:01,520
Just being with
the original five.

535
00:26:01,592 --> 00:26:04,117
Plus Harley,
but he's like one of us.

536
00:26:04,361 --> 00:26:07,330
I don't think we've
ever done this before...

537
00:26:07,464 --> 00:26:10,297
Had a meal together
and hung out like this.

538
00:26:10,401 --> 00:26:12,460
You mean other than
the first 13 years
of your life.

539
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,037
LUKE: Oh, I know
what she's saying.

540
00:26:14,104 --> 00:26:20,441
It's been awesome
just for a whole
day to be just us.

541
00:26:38,295 --> 00:26:41,958
Something feels right
in the universe again,
doesn't it?

542
00:26:44,835 --> 00:26:47,929
So, who's coming home, when?
No one's told me the details.

543

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

544
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,504

(JANE EXHALES)

546
00:26:53,844 --> 00:26:54,902
Okay, we're gonna
pack Luke up.

547
00:26:54,979 --> 00:26:56,344
Three of us leave
day after tomorrow

548
00:26:56,447 --> 00:26:58,176
and Luke's coming home
end of the week.

549
00:26:58,282 --> 00:27:00,443
JAKE: Uh, I will.
Great.

550
00:27:00,517 --> 00:27:03,486
I'll call you
when I land. Bye.

551
00:27:03,587 --> 00:27:05,612
Hey, Janey,
what flight are you on?

552
00:27:05,689 --> 00:27:07,452
I'm on the 4:00.

553
00:27:07,524 --> 00:27:09,253
Oh! Too bad,
I'm on the 5:00.

554
00:27:09,326 --> 00:27:11,851
That's nuts!
Why don't you try to get
on the same flight?

555
00:27:11,962 --> 00:27:13,953
Yeah, I could try.

556
00:27:14,264 --> 00:27:16,255
It's been great,
but let's not push it.

557
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:17,766
Mom, he's just
trying to be nice.

558
00:27:17,835 --> 00:27:21,271
I know. I know. I know.
Okay, I gotta take off, kids.

559
00:27:21,338 --> 00:27:22,396
So, thank you for staying.

560
00:27:22,473 --> 00:27:23,462
Absolutely, yeah.

561
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:26,338
You be good.
I'm so proud of you.

562
00:27:26,443 --> 00:27:27,603

Let's see if this works.

00:29:16,687 --> 00:29:18,279
So, if we move
this wall back a bit,

606
00:29:18,355 --> 00:29:19,879
uh, we can bring
this arch forward,

607
00:29:19,957 --> 00:29:21,117

you want it, right?

I would love that.
I thought so.

(SIGHS)

610
00:29:24,795 --> 00:29:28,287
I have an idea.
What if we move
my bedroom wall

611
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:33,301
like 6 or 8 feet that way,
just so I can get more
of the morning light?

612
00:29:33,971 --> 00:29:35,233
Not possible?

613
00:29:35,305 --> 00:29:37,569
(CHUCKLES) Yes.
But you'd wake up
in the morning,

614
00:29:37,641 --> 00:29:40,303
walk out your bedroom door
and fall 12 feet
into the kitchen.

was all open up there.

you're headed,

what I can do.

this property

Do you mind?

it's not huge. It's...

to you a little later
when we're closer to...

639
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:39,860
ADAM: Uh... I... I think
our next step is to
stake out the addition

640
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:41,232
and see how it
feels size-wise.

641
00:30:41,305 --> 00:30:42,533
Yeah, that would be great.

642
00:30:42,639 --> 00:30:44,834
So, I will e-mail you
and we'll set something up.

643
00:30:44,942 --> 00:30:46,204
Sounds great.

00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:48,005

00:30:48,078 --> 00:30:49,705

Why haven't you returned
any of my calls or e-mails?

This is just too weird.

(VOICE QUIVERING)
I haven't slept in days.

655
00:31:23,213 --> 00:31:27,047
What we did was so wrong
on so many levels.

656
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:29,846
And it was so right
on a couple of levels, too.

657
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,046
Admit it.

658
00:31:31,121 --> 00:31:32,213
No, it wasn't.

659
00:31:32,322 --> 00:31:34,051
On no levels was it right.

660
00:31:34,157 --> 00:31:36,921
You can't say
we didn't enjoy
each other's company.

661

Sitting at the bar, dancing.

662
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,525
After dancing. Come on.

663
00:31:41,598 --> 00:31:43,725
You and I haven't
had fun like that
in 100 years.

664
00:31:43,834 --> 00:31:47,736
Yes,
because we're not supposed
to have fun like that.

665
00:31:47,838 --> 00:31:49,829
We are divorced.

00:31:50,274 --> 00:31:51,673
(SIGHING DEEPLY)

667
00:31:51,742 --> 00:31:56,202
Are you, like,
what, unhappy at home?
Does she not understand you?

668
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:59,579
Or did you just want
to know what it would be
like with someone my age?

669
00:31:59,683 --> 00:32:01,048
What is this?

670
00:32:01,118 --> 00:32:03,552
I'd be lying
if I said I never
think about you, Janey.

671
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:06,612
I think about you a lot.

672
00:32:06,723 --> 00:32:11,023
And, no, it's not
perfect at home, obviously.
Look at me.

and I'm going to
kindergarten interviews.

I'm a walking cliché.

675
00:32:15,565 --> 00:32:19,092
And I can't, literally,
can't stop thinking

676
00:32:19,169 --> 00:32:21,399
about what happened
in New York.

677
00:32:21,471 --> 00:32:25,635
Fate brought us
together once,
maybe it happened again.

678
00:32:25,742 --> 00:32:29,473
And I know you've moved on
with your life, I get it.

679
00:32:29,579 --> 00:32:33,709
But you can't deny that
something real and honest
happened that night.

680
00:32:33,784 --> 00:32:36,378
Can't we just go with it?
See where it takes us?

681
00:32:36,453 --> 00:32:38,250
No one has to know.

682
00:32:38,322 --> 00:32:39,346
(CHUCKLES) Wow.

683
00:32:39,423 --> 00:32:42,256
You were so great,
so loose and sexy.

684
00:32:42,326 --> 00:32:45,295
How often do you get
to be like that?

685
00:32:45,395 --> 00:32:47,488
You can run and
open restaurants

686
00:32:47,564 --> 00:32:50,226
and build your
perfect kitchen.

687
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:55,431
But what about
having someone to hold you
in the middle of the night?

688
00:32:55,505 --> 00:32:57,996
Not high on
my list these days.

689
00:32:58,108 --> 00:33:00,804
What if that
someone is someone
who's known you

690
00:33:00,911 --> 00:33:02,742
since you were 23?

691
00:33:03,914 --> 00:33:05,404
And loved you

692
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:08,145
for most of your life.

693
00:33:08,418 --> 00:33:10,318
Oh, man!

694
00:33:12,422 --> 00:33:15,289
I forgot what
a good lawyer you are.

695
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:17,657
Give this a shot, Janey.

696
00:33:18,195 --> 00:33:20,595
Life is short
and it's tough.

697
00:33:20,664 --> 00:33:22,962
Don't discount what
we have together.

698
00:33:23,033 --> 00:33:24,660
You know what they say,

699
00:33:24,768 --> 00:33:27,862
"People who live
in nursing homes that
have plants live longer

700
00:33:28,705 --> 00:33:30,764
"than the people
without plants."

701
00:33:30,841 --> 00:33:34,333
So you're saying
this is a healthy
choice for me?

702
00:33:34,444 --> 00:33:37,436
Honey, I know it is.

703
00:33:39,783 --> 00:33:40,875

(JANE GROANS)

706
00:33:50,427 --> 00:33:54,193
Oh, God! Oh, God!
It's official.

707
00:33:54,297 --> 00:33:56,993
(WHIMPERS) We're
having an affair.

708
00:33:57,634 --> 00:33:59,932
Why do you need
to label everything?

709
00:34:00,003 --> 00:34:03,439
Because that's what this is.

710
00:34:03,507 --> 00:34:07,534
Yes,
in its crassest form maybe,
if we were two other people.

711
00:34:08,678 --> 00:34:10,669
Just because we were
married for 19 years

712
00:34:10,747 --> 00:34:13,147
does not not
make this an affair.

713
00:34:13,216 --> 00:34:18,677
Okay, but since we
were together for so long,
it's not really that wrong.

714
00:34:18,789 --> 00:34:22,054
Really? You want to run
that logic by your wife?

715
00:34:27,464 --> 00:34:29,056
(CHUCKLES)

716
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,563
Okay, will you
do me a favor?

717
00:34:31,668 --> 00:34:32,760
You're on my side.
Can we switch?

718
00:34:32,836 --> 00:34:36,033
I'm feeling a little,
uh, disoriented.

719
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:38,039
Since when is
this your side?
Since 10 years ago.

720
00:34:38,141 --> 00:34:39,972
Come on, just... Please?

721
00:34:40,043 --> 00:34:41,738
(BOTH GRUNTING)

722
00:34:42,913 --> 00:34:44,403
Can I interest
you in a little...

723
00:34:44,514 --> 00:34:46,345
(CHUCKLES) No.

724
00:34:51,555 --> 00:34:56,424
Why do you think
the sex is so much
sexier this time?

725
00:34:57,427 --> 00:34:59,054
I don't know.

726
00:35:04,067 --> 00:35:06,558
(LAUGHS) I got to go to work.

727
00:35:07,003 --> 00:35:10,063
Okay. Me, too.

728
00:35:18,748 --> 00:35:21,273
You see what happens
when you're not
looking out for me.

729
00:35:21,384 --> 00:35:24,876
She lets me eat everything.
Pasta, cream cheese.

730
00:35:24,955 --> 00:35:26,081
(SCOFFS)

731
00:35:26,189 --> 00:35:28,919
Would you hand me
my robe, please?

732
00:35:29,025 --> 00:35:30,686
(CHUCKLES)

733
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,285
And, um, turn around.

734
00:35:33,396 --> 00:35:35,956
(SCOFFS) Why do
I have to, uh,
turn around?

735
00:35:36,066 --> 00:35:37,397
Because the last
time you saw me

736
00:35:37,467 --> 00:35:40,402
standing up naked
I was in my 40s.

737
00:35:41,905 --> 00:35:44,874
Things look different
lying down. Just...

738
00:35:44,941 --> 00:35:47,034
(CHUCKLES) You've
gotten kind of nuts.

739
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:49,374
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
You know what, Jake,

740
00:35:49,446 --> 00:35:51,243
I think it would be
really good for us

741
00:35:51,314 --> 00:35:54,909
to just not talk
for a couple of days.

742
00:35:54,985 --> 00:35:58,079
You know what I think,
just for the record?

743
00:35:58,822 --> 00:36:01,256
I think we're
doing something
kind of brilliant.

744
00:36:01,324 --> 00:36:04,054
All the things
that tore us apart
aren't issues anymore.

745
00:36:04,127 --> 00:36:08,154
I'd say our problems
actually went away.

746
00:36:08,265 --> 00:36:09,323
(LAUGHS) What?

747
00:36:09,432 --> 00:36:11,730
Didn't you always say
you felt you weren't
being heard?

748
00:36:11,801 --> 00:36:13,564
Wasn't that our big issue?

749
00:36:13,637 --> 00:36:16,970
Both of us always
feeling rejected
and unappreciated.

750
00:36:17,073 --> 00:36:20,133
Look at us now.
You're so much
more together.

751
00:36:20,944 --> 00:36:22,343
You're not exhausted
all the time.

752
00:36:22,445 --> 00:36:23,605
You're not catering
every weekend

753
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,375
or busy all day
with the kids.

754
00:36:25,448 --> 00:36:28,679
And I'm calmer.
Not as obsessed with work.

755
00:36:29,419 --> 00:36:31,478
I'm a partner. I'm there.

756
00:36:31,588 --> 00:36:35,080
We both grew into the people
we wanted each other to be.

757
00:36:35,158 --> 00:36:36,420
Really?

758
00:36:37,494 --> 00:36:41,362
Well, you're better
than I am at remembering
all the details of our...

759
00:36:41,464 --> 00:36:43,796
Do you remember never
having time for sex?

760
00:36:43,867 --> 00:36:45,334
(LAUGHS) Now look at us.

761
00:36:45,435 --> 00:36:48,370
We've already done
it two times this week
and it's only Tuesday.

762
00:36:48,471 --> 00:36:50,996
I swear to God,
if half the people
who got divorced

763
00:36:51,107 --> 00:36:52,938
got back together
after 10 years,

764
00:36:53,009 --> 00:36:55,170
their problems
would be solved.

765
00:36:55,278 --> 00:36:56,506
I think we're
on to something.

766
00:36:56,613 --> 00:36:59,207
(CHUCKLES) Not sure
I agree with that.

767
00:36:59,282 --> 00:37:01,250
And, also, we are
not back together.

768
00:37:01,318 --> 00:37:04,481
And I know other
divorced people
think about this.

769
00:37:04,554 --> 00:37:06,545
They wonder, "What if?"

770
00:37:07,324 --> 00:37:11,385
You know,
I think this is
very French of us.

771
00:37:11,494 --> 00:37:14,861
(LAUGHS) How is
it French of us?

772
00:37:14,965 --> 00:37:19,868
I have a young wife
but I am having sex
with my old wife.

773
00:37:21,171 --> 00:37:25,471
Not old. You know, "ex."
I didn't mean "old."

774
00:37:27,143 --> 00:37:28,303
You're doing that
thing when you act

775
00:37:28,378 --> 00:37:29,504
like you're not
listening to me,

776
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:32,480
but think about
what I said, okay?

777
00:37:32,549 --> 00:37:33,880
You got any of
your homemade
granola here?

778
00:37:33,984 --> 00:37:35,679
It's been so long
since I had any.

So much.

We sell it for 6.50
a bag at the store.

well, why give it away
when you can...

She wants to be courted.

this happen?

We did it once there
and once here.

Or maybe, maybe more
than once there.

I don't know.
I was drunk, so I'm...

there's something
perfect about this.

to cook for him,
or clean up after him.

have to sleep with him.

to have it figured out.

1037
00:48:42,218 --> 00:48:44,311
(CHUCKLING)
Not tonight, big guy.

1038
00:48:44,387 --> 00:48:45,718
(CHUCKLES) Is it really
necessary for you

1039
00:48:45,788 --> 00:48:48,450
to always say no
before you say yes?

1040
00:48:48,524 --> 00:48:50,151
I'm not gonna think
less of you, you know.

1041
00:48:50,226 --> 00:48:52,524
Really, Jake.
I'm a little tired

1042
00:48:52,595 --> 00:48:54,961
and I was gonna
take a bath, and just...

1043
00:48:55,031 --> 00:48:57,966
Okay. So we'll
just hang out.

1044
00:48:58,034 --> 00:49:00,502
(GASPS) Is that
croque-monsieur?

1045
00:49:00,569 --> 00:49:01,627
Yeah.

1046
00:49:01,704 --> 00:49:03,729
Whose plate is this,
yours or his?
(CHUCKLES) That's mine.

1047
00:49:03,806 --> 00:49:06,172
(MOANS)

1048
00:49:06,242 --> 00:49:08,642
My God! Just like
I remember it.

1049
00:49:09,412 --> 00:49:12,347
Don't you ever eat
at your house?

1050
00:49:12,415 --> 00:49:15,873
Pedro dictates most meals,
and he has a very

1051
00:49:15,985 --> 00:49:17,646
limited palate.
Mmm-hmm.

1052
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:18,948
What kind of
ice cream is that?

1053
00:49:19,021 --> 00:49:20,454
Lavender honey.

1054
00:49:20,523 --> 00:49:21,683
Not sleeping?

1055
00:49:21,757 --> 00:49:23,748
Not at all. You?

1056
00:49:25,094 --> 00:49:26,755
Never slept better.
Mmm-hmm.

1057
00:49:26,862 --> 00:49:29,922
And my digestion is
finally back on track.

1058
00:49:30,032 --> 00:49:33,001
You've turned my world
right-side up, Jane.

1059
00:49:33,602 --> 00:49:36,662
You know what
that means, don't you?

1060
00:49:36,739 --> 00:49:39,003
(SIGHS HEAVILY) No.

1061
00:49:41,444 --> 00:49:45,346
That I've never
really known how
to live without you.

1062
00:49:53,222 --> 00:49:56,783
You know,
maybe we should be
growing old together.

1063
00:49:56,892 --> 00:50:03,855
(CHUCKLES) I hate
to tell you, big guy,
we already grew old, apart.

1064
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:05,294
What is with the "big guy"?

1065
00:50:05,401 --> 00:50:09,098
Is it because I'm fat,
or is it a term
of endearment?

1066
00:50:09,171 --> 00:50:13,005
(CHUCKLING) I have no idea
why I keep saying that.
I'm sorry. I'll stop.

1067
00:50:13,109 --> 00:50:14,474
Thank you.

1068
00:50:16,312 --> 00:50:17,802
I love how quiet
it is in your house.

1069
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,313
Mmm.

1070
00:50:20,316 --> 00:50:23,513
I have no quiet
in my life. Ever.

1071
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,520
Well, you live
with a 5-year-old.

1072
00:50:26,622 --> 00:50:28,852
Yes. And let's
not forget Pedro.

1073
00:50:28,958 --> 00:50:30,755
(LAUGHS)

1074
00:50:32,661 --> 00:50:37,997
What are you saying, exactly?
What's going on over
there at your place?

1075
00:50:38,501 --> 00:50:39,866
(EXHALES)

1076
00:50:42,038 --> 00:50:43,972
My marriage is

1077
00:50:45,107 --> 00:50:48,167
not turning out
as I hoped.
That's obvious.

1078
00:50:48,277 --> 00:50:53,010
Agness started out
really looking up to me.
We never used to fight.

1079
00:50:53,115 --> 00:50:54,810
But now with
the kid, lately,

1080
00:50:54,884 --> 00:50:57,546
we're all about what
school he's going to

1081
00:50:57,653 --> 00:51:00,952
and she thinks we
need a bigger house,
more help.

1082
00:51:01,023 --> 00:51:03,014
I was hoping to
cut back at work,

1083
00:51:03,092 --> 00:51:05,060
but now that's
never gonna happen.

1084
00:51:05,161 --> 00:51:06,185
And she wants to
have another baby

1085
00:51:06,262 --> 00:51:08,753
before Pedro gets
too old, which I get.

1086
00:51:08,831 --> 00:51:11,493
But since we're
always fighting...

1087
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,160
(CHUCKLES) Oh, God.
Listen to me.

1088
00:51:15,538 --> 00:51:18,439
Isn't a baby part of
the deal when you marry
a woman that age?

1089
00:51:18,507 --> 00:51:21,271
Is it? I guess so.

1090
00:51:21,811 --> 00:51:25,144
She's got me booked
at the fertility center
every other day,

1091
00:51:25,214 --> 00:51:27,944
and she is so amped up
on hormone injections,

1092
00:51:28,017 --> 00:51:30,781
I'm gonna have
to find an exorcist if
she doesn't calm down.

1093
00:51:30,853 --> 00:51:32,787
(CHUCKLES)

1094
00:51:32,855 --> 00:51:34,720
I wish it was funny.

1095
00:51:35,825 --> 00:51:37,053
Incredible ice cream.

1096
00:51:37,126 --> 00:51:38,320
Hmm.

1097
00:51:38,394 --> 00:51:40,794
I'm turning around.

1098
00:51:40,863 --> 00:51:43,798
Hey, remember when
we used to smoke pot

1099
00:51:43,866 --> 00:51:45,925
and eat your ice cream
in the hot tub?

1100
00:51:46,001 --> 00:51:51,234
(GIGGLES) The hot tub?
That feels like
a billion years ago.

1101
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:53,968
Yeah. How long has
it been since you, uh...

1102
00:51:54,043 --> 00:51:55,169
(PUFFS REPEATEDLY)

1103
00:51:55,244 --> 00:51:58,304
Me? Since before
Lauren was born.

1104
00:51:58,380 --> 00:51:59,711
Twenty-seven years.

1105
00:51:59,782 --> 00:52:00,908
At least.

1106
00:52:00,983 --> 00:52:02,143
Huh?

1107
00:52:02,218 --> 00:52:03,981
(GASPS)

1108
00:52:04,053 --> 00:52:08,581
Are you kidding me?
Oh, put that away.
Oh! It's been too long.

1109
00:52:08,691 --> 00:52:10,522
Exactly.
(CHUCKLES) I'm not gonna...

1110
00:52:10,593 --> 00:52:14,495
Okay. I'm gonna
leave this for you.
It's kind of amazing.

1111
00:52:14,563 --> 00:52:18,021
You take a few hits,
get your sea legs back,

1112
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:20,762
and, uh, we'll finish
the rest of it together.

1113
00:52:20,836 --> 00:52:21,996
(CHUCKLES) Maybe.

1114
00:52:22,071 --> 00:52:26,201
So, that nerdy
architect likes you.
You know that, right?

1115
00:52:26,275 --> 00:52:28,209
He's not nerdy.

1116
00:52:28,277 --> 00:52:30,711
And he definitely doesn't.

1117
00:52:30,779 --> 00:52:32,269
We're just...
We're working together.

1118
00:52:32,381 --> 00:52:35,373
I was watching
while you leaned over
to open the oven,

1119
00:52:35,451 --> 00:52:39,751
and his eyes were
glued to your ass.

1120
00:52:39,855 --> 00:52:41,789
Hey, do me a favor?

1121
00:52:44,226 --> 00:52:46,956
Tell me the truth, Janey.
Is this a great
affair or what?

1122
00:52:47,029 --> 00:52:49,827
(CHUCKLES) I don't know.
It's my first.

1123
00:52:49,899 --> 00:52:53,164
We don't even
have to have sex,
and it's fun.

1124
00:52:53,235 --> 00:52:54,327
(CHUCKLES)

1125
00:52:54,403 --> 00:52:55,529
I wish I could sleep over.

1126
00:52:55,638 --> 00:52:59,734
(CHUCKLES) I got to talk
to my shrink about this.
This is...

1127
00:52:59,842 --> 00:53:03,334
This is a lot to handle.
You better go, I guess.

1128
00:53:06,849 --> 00:53:08,043
(EXHALES)

1129
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:09,412
(WHISPERING) It's okay.

1130
00:53:09,518 --> 00:53:11,076
(WHISPERING) No.

1131
00:53:11,854 --> 00:53:14,652
Whoa!
What is happening, Jake?

1132
00:53:23,532 --> 00:53:25,022
(BOTH MOAN)

1133
00:53:26,835 --> 00:53:28,325
(PHONE RINGING)

1134
00:53:28,404 --> 00:53:30,531
(JANE CHUCKLES)

1135
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:32,564
Don't get it.

1136
00:53:32,641 --> 00:53:35,201
I always get it.
I have three kids.

1137
00:53:37,246 --> 00:53:40,943
Hello? Hi. You're still
on the phone?

1138
00:53:42,685 --> 00:53:45,176
(CHUCKLES) Plane,
I meant plane.

1139
00:53:46,021 --> 00:53:48,922
Uh-huh? Well, how was Luke
when you left him?

1140
00:53:49,024 --> 00:53:53,188
Oh, that sounds like fun.
Yeah, let me know
what I can bring.

1141
00:53:53,262 --> 00:53:56,288
No! I have no idea
where he is.

1142
00:53:57,366 --> 00:53:59,095
Okay, sweetheart.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

1143
00:53:59,201 --> 00:54:00,930
Oh! Now I'm lying.

1144
00:54:02,371 --> 00:54:03,998
Lauren and Harley
are giving Luke

1145
00:54:04,073 --> 00:54:07,372
a graduation party
this weekend.
Sweet, huh?

1146
00:54:07,776 --> 00:54:09,744
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

1147
00:54:10,379 --> 00:54:13,075
Hello, stranger.
Welcome back.

1148
00:54:13,882 --> 00:54:16,612
I'm, uh, just getting
into my car.

1149
00:54:16,719 --> 00:54:19,347
Yeah, this weekend
sounds great.

1150
00:54:19,421 --> 00:54:20,752
Let me know
what I can bring.

1151
00:54:21,156 --> 00:54:22,180
(EXCLAIMS SOFTLY)

00:54:22,258 --> 00:54:23,282
(MOUTHING)

1153
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:24,383
Okay.

1154
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:26,325
(CONTINUES CHATTERING)

1155
00:54:26,428 --> 00:54:27,986
(LAUGHS)

1156
00:54:36,505 --> 00:54:39,531
Why am I laughing?
I mean, it's like nuts!

1157
00:54:49,351 --> 00:54:51,012
(SQUEALS) Dr. Allen.

1158
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,678
Jane, hi.
Am I seeing you today?

1159
00:54:52,788 --> 00:54:55,154
Oh, no.
I just wanted to talk.
And I was wondering

1160
00:54:55,257 --> 00:54:58,021
if by any chance you
could squeeze me in for
an emergency session?

1161
00:54:58,127 --> 00:55:00,789
(CHUCKLES)
Because I'm sort of in
desperate need of advice.

1162
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:03,093
I brought you
some coffee cake
that you like.

1163
00:55:03,165 --> 00:55:05,326
Not as a bribe
or anything. But...

1164
00:55:05,434 --> 00:55:07,026
I only have 20 minutes
before my first patient.

1165
00:55:07,136 --> 00:55:09,104
Well, that's fine!
I'll talk fast.

1166
00:55:09,171 --> 00:55:13,801
So at this point,
I just need some sound,
unbiased guidance.

1167
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:19,947
Is having an affair
with you-know-who
a good thing or a bad thing?

1168
00:55:21,283 --> 00:55:23,717
It's a bad thing, right?
This can't be...
How can it be good?

1169
00:55:23,819 --> 00:55:26,117
It's not good,
it's not bad.

1170
00:55:26,855 --> 00:55:28,152
(MUTTERS)

1171
00:55:28,257 --> 00:55:30,623
I've made a list
of everything

1172
00:55:30,693 --> 00:55:33,594
this could possibly
be about at my end.

1173
00:55:35,364 --> 00:55:36,388
May I read it to you?

1174
00:55:36,465 --> 00:55:38,592
Oh, please, of course.

1175
00:55:38,967 --> 00:55:40,594
Uh...

1176
00:55:40,669 --> 00:55:43,297
(CHUCKLES) Because
I e-mailed it to myself.

1177
00:55:43,372 --> 00:55:44,532
(CHUCKLES)

1178
00:55:45,541 --> 00:55:48,442
Okay. "Am I still
trying to figure out
why the marriage failed?

1179
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:50,876
"Do I want to
get back together?

1180
00:55:50,979 --> 00:55:53,812
"Do we have
unfinished business?

1181
00:55:53,882 --> 00:55:57,443
"Is this about revenge?
Or am I...

00:56:05,394 --> 00:56:07,191
(SHAKY VOICE)
"Am I just lonely?

1183
00:56:07,296 --> 00:56:08,593
"Or is it my
caretaker thing?"

1184
00:56:08,664 --> 00:56:10,598
I mean, the kids
are finally gone now,

1185
00:56:10,666 --> 00:56:12,190
and all of
a sudden Jake is back,

1186
00:56:12,267 --> 00:56:14,895
and I get to take care
of him in some way.

1187
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:18,838
Now, I understand.
I get how therapy works.
I really do.

1188
00:56:19,708 --> 00:56:22,700
We look at things,
we examine them.
Weeks turn into months.

1189
00:56:22,811 --> 00:56:24,403
And we're going
on eight years now.

1190
00:56:24,513 --> 00:56:25,571
(CHUCKLES)

1191
00:56:25,681 --> 00:56:27,876
And I'm okay with that.
I really am, believe me.

1192
00:56:27,983 --> 00:56:30,144
I... I like it, I do.

1193
00:56:30,219 --> 00:56:34,246
But in this case,
I need you to tell me
what you really think.

1194
00:56:34,356 --> 00:56:38,053
Like, "Don't do this."

1195
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,855
You know,
I'd like you to say,

1196
00:56:39,928 --> 00:56:41,919
"Don't do this.
It's absolutely wrong,"

1197
00:56:42,030 --> 00:56:44,430
or, "Go ahead.
You'll be fine."

1198
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:48,234
I actually want to
be told what to do.

1199
00:56:49,004 --> 00:56:51,529
What's interesting is,
I'm already
seeing you open up

1200
00:56:51,607 --> 00:56:53,404
more than you have

there's a French film

1374

So I was wondering
if you might want to go

1375
01:05:30,998 --> 01:05:32,522
to the
opening night tomorrow.

1376

No. See? Too much.

01:34:38,644 --> 01:34:40,305
Okay. Good note.

01:34:42,148 --> 01:34:45,606

what you're doing?

1891
01:34:45,685 --> 01:34:48,153

1892
01:34:49,355 --> 01:34:50,652
I'm fine.

1893
01:34:50,756 --> 01:34:52,121
Okay, I'm going to
go to the video store

1894

and get us a DVD
we can watch tonight.

1895
01:34:53,793 --> 01:34:55,351
Mmm-hmm.
We'll have movie night,
like old times.

1896
01:34:55,461 --> 01:34:58,294
How's that?
I'll make the popcorn.

Oh! Where's your mom?
She disappeared so fast
after the movie.

1929

She's probably sleeping.

I think she's
on her computer.

So weird. Still is.

1933
01:36:33,559 --> 01:36:34,617
I loved tonight.

1934
01:36:34,694 --> 01:36:36,423
Yeah. That's why
it's so weird.

1935
01:36:36,495 --> 01:36:39,020
Just to see you in
your robe in our kitchen.

1936
01:36:39,098 --> 01:36:40,497
Remember when you
weren't even allowed in?

1937
01:36:40,566 --> 01:36:42,727
Mom used to go out to
the car to talk to you.

1938
01:36:42,835 --> 01:36:46,931
You know, I don't even
really remember you
and Mom as a couple.

1939
01:36:47,373 --> 01:36:50,342
What do you mean?
You were 10 when
we broke up.

1940
01:36:50,409 --> 01:36:52,240
I was 12, actually.

1941

And I don't know,
it's just...
It's all foggy to me now.

1942
01:36:56,082 --> 01:36:58,050
You don't
remember us in Hawaii

1943
01:36:58,117 --> 01:37:00,415
or all of us sleeping
together in that tent
in the backyard?

1944
01:37:00,519 --> 01:37:03,750
Yeah, of course.
I just...
I don't remember, like,

1945
01:37:04,223 --> 01:37:08,182
you and Mom hugging
or waking up together.

I'm not damaged or anything.

1948

Dude, speak for yourself.
I am definitely damaged
from this divorce.

I don't know.
You and Mom sleeping
in the same house?

Harley thought
we should stay.

She exaggerates.
I just thought, perhaps,

1954
01:37:28,848 --> 01:37:30,611
you might want
to talk later or...

1955
01:37:30,716 --> 01:37:32,308
Is that the noodle thing?

1956
01:37:34,754 --> 01:37:37,348

why I kept it.

Okay. Just let me explain.

The reason
that I left Agness
was not just because

my marriage
wasn't working.

2004
01:40:14,313 --> 01:40:17,771

stopped loving her.

I know you don't need
my advice, but...

01:43:57,269 --> 01:43:59,635
(CHUCKLES) I got this one.

2031
01:43:59,705 --> 01:44:02,037
Yeah. Yeah,
I know you do.

(EXHALES)

2033
01:44:24,296 --> 01:44:28,733
Knowing how to be divorced
is next to impossible.

2034
01:44:30,202 --> 01:44:32,670
And sometimes,
over the years,

2035
01:44:32,738 --> 01:44:37,004
I have thought
that your dad and I
weren't quite finished.

2036
01:44:38,510 --> 01:44:41,479
(EXHALES) And as it
turns out, we weren't.

2037
01:44:42,814 --> 01:44:44,975
So, I went out of
my comfort zone,

2038
01:44:45,050 --> 01:44:48,019
which I found out if
you're really honest
with yourself,

2039
01:44:48,086 --> 01:44:50,316
isn't all that comforting.

2040
01:44:50,722 --> 01:44:53,384
And I experimented
with a part of myself

2041
01:44:53,492 --> 01:44:56,154
because I wanted to know
if after all these years

2042
01:44:56,228 --> 01:45:00,187
there was still something
there between us.

2043
01:45:00,832 --> 01:45:02,390
And was there?

2044
01:45:02,901 --> 01:45:05,062
Mmm,
there kind of was. Yeah.

2045
01:45:05,704 --> 01:45:07,968
But, Mom,
you have to understand

2046
01:45:08,040 --> 01:45:10,270
how bonkers
this sounds to us.

2047
01:45:10,375 --> 01:45:11,364
Mmm.

2048
01:45:11,443 --> 01:45:12,842
For two people,

2049
01:45:12,911 --> 01:45:16,369
who for years couldn't be
in the same room together,

2050
01:45:16,448 --> 01:45:18,439
to then have an affair.

2051
01:45:18,550 --> 01:45:21,713
I know. It was hard
for me and I was doing it.

2052
01:45:22,454 --> 01:45:27,517
I hope you'll forgive me
for confusing you.

2053

And betraying your trust.

2054
01:45:32,698 --> 01:45:35,132
But, I did this for me.

2055
01:45:35,968 --> 01:45:37,902
And I did it for him.

2056
01:45:38,303 --> 01:45:40,931
And I realize
that even though
your dad and I

2057
01:45:41,006 --> 01:45:44,442
once had
something extraordinary,

2058
01:45:45,477 --> 01:45:50,210
now we no longer really

2059
01:45:51,950 --> 01:45:53,474
fit together.

2060
01:45:56,822 --> 01:46:00,223
But he is a part of me.
He always will be.

2061
01:46:00,659 --> 01:46:04,755
So, it's over now?
You guys are back
to being divorced?

2062
01:46:06,131 --> 01:46:07,462
Mmm-hmm.

2063
01:46:10,702 --> 01:46:12,761
For better or for worse.

2064
01:46:18,143 --> 01:46:19,542
Come here.

2065
01:46:20,712 --> 01:46:22,077
My littles...

2066
01:46:22,147 --> 01:46:23,978
Okay, I'm coming in.

2067
01:46:24,716 --> 01:46:25,808

2068
01:46:25,917 --> 01:46:27,248

(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

2070
01:46:34,726 --> 01:46:36,717
ADAM: So, did you
get the elevations?

2071
01:46:36,795 --> 01:46:38,729
ADAM: Yup,
we like them, too.

2072
01:46:39,331 --> 01:46:43,165
Uh-huh.
Yeah. No, we can
definitely do that.

2073
01:46:43,235 --> 01:46:46,432
And I can have more
for you by mid week.

2074
01:46:49,541 --> 01:46:52,874
Sean, uh, can
I call you right back?
Someone just...

2075
01:46:52,944 --> 01:46:54,468
Thanks.

2076
01:46:56,915 --> 01:46:58,246
Hi.
Hi.

2077
01:46:59,418 --> 01:47:00,442
May I come in?

2078
01:47:00,519 --> 01:47:01,508
Uh, sure.

2079
01:47:05,924 --> 01:47:07,289
(EXHALES)

2080
01:47:10,962 --> 01:47:14,193
I didn't call you last night
because I wasn't sure
you'd take the call.

2081
01:47:14,299 --> 01:47:15,527
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

2082
01:47:15,634 --> 01:47:17,329
And then I thought
that could go on
for months.

2083
01:47:17,436 --> 01:47:19,529
I would've taken the call.

2084
01:47:19,705 --> 01:47:22,868
Oh! Okay. Well...

2085
01:47:24,209 --> 01:47:26,973
Anyway, it's better
to say these things
in person, Adam.

2086
01:47:27,045 --> 01:47:28,876
The man that
I was seeing...

2087
01:47:28,980 --> 01:47:31,676
I think I'm up to
speed on that part.

2088
01:47:33,051 --> 01:47:36,612
Yeah.
Anyway, I want you to know
it didn't last long.

2089
01:47:37,489 --> 01:47:39,218
You're divorced. I mean,

2090
01:47:39,324 --> 01:47:41,622
maybe you can understand
when a marriage ends

2091
01:47:41,693 --> 01:47:45,629
there's doubts and hurt
and when you have kids,
you just...

2092
01:47:45,697 --> 01:47:48,165
Sometimes you wonder
if you did the right thing,

2093
01:47:48,233 --> 01:47:50,633
and the moment
presents itself and...

2094
01:47:50,702 --> 01:47:53,967
I get it. I could
imagine it. I could.

2095
01:47:55,407 --> 01:47:58,740
And I told him
that it wasn't going
to work out between us,

2096
01:47:58,844 --> 01:48:02,678
but I guess he didn't
hear me or believe me.

2097
01:48:04,483 --> 01:48:07,247
And, uh, unbeknownst to me,
he showed up at
my house yesterday

2098
01:48:07,352 --> 01:48:08,876
and he has left Agness.

2099
01:48:08,987 --> 01:48:12,320
Jane, I actually
think I understand
what happened.

2100
01:48:13,859 --> 01:48:17,989
But, you know, um,
I'm not as macho
as I appear.

2101
01:48:18,363 --> 01:48:22,322
And I think it's
probably best for us

2102
01:48:22,401 --> 01:48:24,369
if we don't get
any more involved.

2103
01:48:25,370 --> 01:48:30,398
Because your
relationship with Jake
isn't really done.

2104
01:48:30,942 --> 01:48:32,466
And I know
you're saying it is,

2105
01:48:32,544 --> 01:48:35,342
but he's still
in love with you.

2106
01:48:36,615 --> 01:48:40,949
And for everyone's sake,
I think that should
probably get resolved.

2107
01:48:44,523 --> 01:48:48,050
Wow. So that's how
grownups talk.

2108
01:48:51,396 --> 01:48:53,796
Please don't tell me that
you're going to quit my job

2109
01:48:53,899 --> 01:48:56,299
and ask Peter
to take over now.

2110
01:48:56,468 --> 01:48:59,460
'Cause then I'll never
get to see you. And...

2111
01:48:59,571 --> 01:49:03,530
Um... I was thinking
of asking Peter
to step back in.

2112
01:49:07,479 --> 01:49:09,242
I hope you don't.

2113
01:49:10,649 --> 01:49:11,946
Thanks.

2114
01:49:23,962 --> 01:49:25,327
(EXHALES)

2115
01:50:13,111 --> 01:50:14,510
I'm sorry.

2116
01:50:19,618 --> 01:50:22,052
How far back
does that sorry go?

2117
01:50:22,487 --> 01:50:24,478
How far back do
you need it to go?

2118
01:50:24,556 --> 01:50:26,023
Way back.

2119
01:50:27,526 --> 01:50:30,290
Consider it an
all-inclusive apology.

2120
01:50:30,962 --> 01:50:35,990
From not being
the husband you needed

2121
01:50:37,202 --> 01:50:40,000
to showing up nude on
your bed last night.

2122
01:50:40,071 --> 01:50:41,299
Yeah.

2123
01:50:43,241 --> 01:50:47,007
(CHUCKLES) What were you
thinking with that move?

2124
01:50:47,913 --> 01:50:50,245
That you would
find me irresistible.

2125
01:50:50,348 --> 01:50:51,372
Mmm-hmm.

2126
01:50:51,449 --> 01:50:53,747
I never considered
the alternative.

2127
01:50:53,852 --> 01:50:56,047
Got to love that
about you.

2128
01:50:56,855 --> 01:50:58,152
Oh, man.

2129
01:50:59,691 --> 01:51:04,060
I can't believe
I got up to bat again
and blew it.

2130
01:51:04,429 --> 01:51:06,260
You didn't blow it.

2132
01:51:08,199 --> 01:51:09,666
We blew it.

2133
01:51:10,835 --> 01:51:13,360
We blew it
the first time around.

2134
01:51:14,105 --> 01:51:17,074
This time we just
should've known better.

2135
01:51:18,376 --> 01:51:22,745
Too much time has passed.
Too much has happened.

2136
01:51:24,716 --> 01:51:27,708
And you don't think
we could make it right?

2137
01:51:29,554 --> 01:51:33,217
Does that mean
you thought it didn't
feel right either?

2138
01:51:33,792 --> 01:51:37,421
Being with you, Jane,
is the best I'm going to be.

2139
01:51:37,796 --> 01:51:40,230
But do you agree it...

2140
01:51:41,199 --> 01:51:42,223
It wasn't really...

2141
01:51:42,300 --> 01:51:44,097
It was complicated.

2142
01:51:45,136 --> 01:51:46,467
Begging for an answer.

2143
01:51:46,571 --> 01:51:48,539
I thought it was good.

2144
01:51:49,374 --> 01:51:51,365
I wanted it to be good.

2145
01:51:52,577 --> 01:51:55,307
Well, it's as close
as I'm going to get,
I guess.

always have to be
so hard on me?

No, I don't.

I don't regret
giving it another shot.

been better if you
hadn't been married.

it's good luck to start

to have any of those

you like those, huh?

Oh, well,
I don't have any here,

into town and get some,

to do that?
