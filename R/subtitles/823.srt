00:01:00,744 --> 00:01:03,713
Don't stress. Just relax.

3
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,575
I understand you can lose keys.

4
00:01:05,749 --> 00:01:08,343
You can lose your wallet.
How do you lose a plane?

5
00:01:08,518 --> 00:01:10,247
Reese, what do you want me to do?

6
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,611
We got three out of four planes in.
That's a lot of coke.

7
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:18,056
Now, that's the kind of winning attitude
that'll take this enterprise to the top.

8
00:01:18,228 --> 00:01:20,719
In all fairness, Reese, it wasn't his fault.

9
00:01:20,897 --> 00:01:23,866
Are you his attorney?
Why are you in the conversation?

10
00:01:25,235 --> 00:01:26,634
Come on, I'm kidding!

11
00:01:26,903 --> 00:01:29,428
- I'm just kidding with you.
- He loves to joke.

12
00:01:29,606 --> 00:01:34,135
Terrence here is absolutely right.
I mean, hell, three out of four ain't bad.

13
00:01:35,546 --> 00:01:37,605
Let's celebrate. Who wants a beer?

14
00:01:37,782 --> 00:01:39,147
- Great!
- Okay.

15
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,787
- Baby!
- Coke. It costs money.

16
00:01:46,323 --> 00:01:48,416
Planes. They cost money.

17
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:54,028
This yacht, this perm, my kid's braces, it all
costs money. Do you think Kitty's free?

18
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:56,291
Kitty, turn around. Turn around!

19
00:01:58,602 --> 00:02:00,627
Reese, please put the gun down.

20
00:02:06,944 --> 00:02:11,779
Now, the next time that a plane
goes down, you better be on it.

21
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,417
Will you do my back, please?

22
00:02:14,785 --> 00:02:16,480
- Sure.
- I don't wanna tan weird.

23
00:02:16,654 --> 00:02:17,916
- Am I tanning weird?
- No.

24
00:02:18,088 --> 00:02:19,487
- Honestly.
- You're bronzing.

25
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,236
<i>There's no such thing
as a petty crime.</i>

26
00:02:32,671 --> 00:02:35,265
<i>No minor infractions.</i>

27
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,032
<i>There's only the law.</i>

28
00:02:38,176 --> 00:02:40,542
Freeze! Bay City P.D.!

29
00:02:43,982 --> 00:02:46,473
<i>That's me in the leather jacket
and tight jeans.</i>

30
00:02:47,986 --> 00:02:50,819
<i>See that guy I'm chasing?
I hate him.</i>

31
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:53,423
<i>And I'll do everything
in my power to stop him.</i>

32
00:02:53,592 --> 00:02:55,492
Wanna play, let's play.

33
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,424
<i>Because it's my job to stop him.</i>

34
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:03,158
Goddamn!

35
00:03:03,335 --> 00:03:06,827
<i>And the city pays me a damn
good salary to do my job.</i>

36
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:10,874
<i>Besides, he crossed the line.</i>

37
00:03:11,343 --> 00:03:13,573
<i>And in Bay City,
when you cross the line...</i>

38
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,747
<i>... your nuts are mine.</i>

39
00:03:21,086 --> 00:03:22,678
I said, freeze!

40
00:03:22,854 --> 00:03:26,085
<i>My name is David Starsky,
and I'm a cop.</i>

41
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,460
<i>I've always had this theory
about police work:</i>

42
00:03:33,065 --> 00:03:35,761
<i>If you can't beat them, join them.</i>

43
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,768
No! No! No!

44
00:03:48,948 --> 00:03:50,176
Put the money in there.

45
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:53,746
<i>Too many cops worry about
the wrong thing: Crime.</i>

46
00:03:54,453 --> 00:03:57,718
<i>Not me, though.
I'm looking out for numero uno.</i>

47
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:02,418
- Hey, old-timer. Put this on Dallas.
- Come on! Let's go!

48
00:04:04,497 --> 00:04:06,488
<i>I'm just a realist, that's all.</i>

49
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:11,000
<i>And besides, you have any idea
how little the city pays us?</i>

50
00:04:12,204 --> 00:04:13,569
Freeze! Bay City P.D.!

51
00:04:14,373 --> 00:04:15,601
Take it easy.

52
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:21,772
Guys, come on.
I'm undercover here.

53
00:04:26,585 --> 00:04:29,817
<i>My name is Ken Hutchinson,
and I'm a cop.</i>

54
00:04:30,824 --> 00:04:33,384
Where did they come from?

55
00:04:37,965 --> 00:04:39,762
<i>Jesus Christ, Starsky.</i>

56
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:42,629
You fired three rounds
into a crowded intersection.

57
00:04:42,803 --> 00:04:44,532
We got a man with a broken hip...

58
00:04:44,705 --> 00:04:47,731
...and some asshole wants
a new top for his Caddy?

59
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:51,636
That purse had $ 7 in it.

60
00:04:52,112 --> 00:04:55,411
- Okay, want my badge? Here, take it.
- Fine.

61
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,544
Come on. I was just making a point.

62
00:05:00,253 --> 00:05:02,278
David, David.

63
00:05:02,456 --> 00:05:06,859
Your mother was one of the finest cops
Bay City ever seen.

64
00:05:07,127 --> 00:05:09,925
Twenty-two years on the force
with the same partner.

65
00:05:10,097 --> 00:05:15,865
You have had 12 partners
over the past four years.

66
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:18,228
She died a legend.

67
00:05:18,405 --> 00:05:20,999
I am not my mother!

68
00:05:22,376 --> 00:05:26,506
I'm sorry.
Detective Hutchinson is here.

69
00:05:26,747 --> 00:05:29,512
Send him in. Have a seat.

70
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:35,653
- How you doing, captain?
- I believe you two know each other.

71
00:05:35,823 --> 00:05:38,018
Yeah, a little bit. How you doing?

72
00:05:38,926 --> 00:05:40,223
- Yeah, right.
- Hutch.

73
00:05:41,095 --> 00:05:43,063
You've got a lot of explaining to do.

74
00:05:43,231 --> 00:05:46,962
I know. Look, I was trying to infiltrate
one of the East Side gangs...

75
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,797
...and work my way up
to the big fish. It's simple.

76
00:05:49,971 --> 00:05:52,303
- You were robbing a bookie.
- That's right.

77
00:05:52,473 --> 00:05:54,304
You've robbed seven bookies.

78
00:05:54,475 --> 00:05:58,571
You haven't filed a report, turned
in any money or arrested anybody.

79
00:05:58,746 --> 00:06:00,543
How can I? They'll know I'm a cop.

80
00:06:00,715 --> 00:06:03,878
I wouldn't worry, you won't
be mistaken for a real cop.

81
00:06:04,052 --> 00:06:09,649
Oh, really? Why don't you go get yourself
another perm and let the grownups talk.

82
00:06:09,824 --> 00:06:12,486
- My hair is naturally curly.
- No, it's not.

83
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,992
- Yes, it is.
- That's a perm job, all the way.

84
00:06:15,163 --> 00:06:16,790
Touch it!

85
00:06:17,532 --> 00:06:20,194
Hey! Why are you touching him?

86
00:06:23,404 --> 00:06:25,235
Jesus!

87
00:06:26,974 --> 00:06:28,965
You know something?

88
00:06:29,645 --> 00:06:32,580
You two deserve each other.

89
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:37,676
Make nice. You're partners.

90
00:06:41,423 --> 00:06:43,118
- You're crazy.
- No, I'm not.

91
00:06:43,292 --> 00:06:45,055
I don't know why you're so upset.

92
00:06:45,227 --> 00:06:48,719
The guy cost us 200 grand.
A "thank you" might be more appropriate.

93
00:06:48,897 --> 00:06:52,424
Who cares about 200 grand?
What if they link us to the murder?

94
00:06:52,601 --> 00:06:55,536
- They won't link us to the murder.
- You don't know that.

95
00:06:55,704 --> 00:06:57,934
Will you let it go, please? Jesus.

96
00:06:58,107 --> 00:07:01,008
- Take a lude. Calm down.
- I did, and I'm still pissed.

97
00:07:01,176 --> 00:07:04,009
Okay, fine. Fine, fine.
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

98
00:07:04,179 --> 00:07:08,013
I promise, I'm not gonna kill Terrence
again. Now, pull it together.

99
00:07:08,183 --> 00:07:09,946
Let's go.

100
00:07:10,686 --> 00:07:12,881
Gentlemen, I apologize
about the delay.

101
00:07:13,355 --> 00:07:16,916
But I promise you what we have
is worth the wait.

102
00:07:18,927 --> 00:07:21,919
- It looks like cocaine.
- That's because it is cocaine.

103
00:07:22,431 --> 00:07:26,663
With a twist. You see,
we've managed to find a way...

104
00:07:26,835 --> 00:07:29,896
...to alter the cell structure
of the coca plant...

105
00:07:30,073 --> 00:07:33,099
...giving it a heightened
perfluoralkylation process...

106
00:07:33,276 --> 00:07:36,973
...creating a new kind
of diazomethane.

107
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,248
Gets a little complicated after that.

108
00:07:39,616 --> 00:07:40,947
Excuse me.

109
00:07:41,818 --> 00:07:44,309
So do you get extra high or what?

110
00:07:45,155 --> 00:07:48,352
Actually, it has all the same
effects as regular cocaine.

111
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,859
Well, if it's the same,
why are we here?

112
00:07:53,863 --> 00:07:56,354
<i>Canis familiaris. The German shepherd.</i>

113
00:07:56,533 --> 00:07:58,933
Its nose has over
220 million scent receptors.

114
00:07:59,102 --> 00:08:03,334
It can detect smells that even the most
advanced technology in the world cannot.

115
00:08:03,506 --> 00:08:05,167
For example:

116
00:08:05,341 --> 00:08:08,469
Lvan, search!

117
00:08:15,885 --> 00:08:18,547
Lvan, stop!

118
00:08:21,324 --> 00:08:23,815
What do you got? You holding?

119
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,695
He brought old coke.

120
00:08:31,202 --> 00:08:34,103
This is new coke.

121
00:08:35,005 --> 00:08:40,568
As far as a dog's concerned, there's nothing
there. 100 percent undetectable cocaine.

122
00:08:40,744 --> 00:08:42,644
Got no coke smell...

123
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,747
...same coke ride.

124
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,144
Tastes kind of sweet.

125
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:51,186
If this shit wasn't illegal, guys,
we'd be up for the Nobel Prize.

126
00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:54,319
Our initial run pumped out
two tons of this stuff...

127
00:08:54,491 --> 00:08:57,051
...and it'll be available
in about three weeks.

128
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:00,357
You boys know who to call.

129
00:09:01,098 --> 00:09:02,531
Ivan!

130
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,669
<i>You don't understand.</i>

131
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,832
They're not like you.

132
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:13,169
They're criminals.

133
00:09:13,444 --> 00:09:16,413
Look, I know we all
got to make living.

134
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:20,880
But these guys, they are dealing
hard drugs right in front of my shop.

135
00:09:23,087 --> 00:09:25,988
I can dig what you're saying,
Mr. Chowdury.

136
00:09:26,156 --> 00:09:29,558
- I wanna thank you for coming in today.
- Of course.

137
00:09:31,129 --> 00:09:35,156
Those gentlemen you speak of,
they'll no longer be a problem.

138
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,698
You have my word.

139
00:09:37,902 --> 00:09:41,565
This is my neighborhood.
People tend to forget that.

140
00:09:42,574 --> 00:09:44,804
Bee Bee, make sure
he gets home safely.

141
00:09:44,976 --> 00:09:48,173
- Yeah, boss.
- Thank you very much, Huggy.

142
00:09:49,147 --> 00:09:50,375
You are a great man.

143
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:54,083
- Begone, little Indian.
- Let's go, little man. Come on.

144
00:09:54,486 --> 00:09:56,386
Taking up time.

145
00:09:57,188 --> 00:10:01,056
- This neighborhood is in need of some help.
- It's cold-blooded, daddy.

146
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:04,127
- Who's next?
- You got Hutch waiting outside.

147
00:10:04,296 --> 00:10:08,824
- What you got my man waiting outside for?
- He brought some extra fuzz with him.

148
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,492
So what? You go get him
and get him in here now.

149
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,005
You've never run an errand
on the clock before?

150
00:10:16,174 --> 00:10:20,770
I take care of my personal business after
work, when the taxpayers aren't paying me.

151
00:10:20,945 --> 00:10:24,142
Give me a break. You've never
stopped to buy a cup of coffee?

152
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,078
I bring a Thermos.

153
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:31,454
Okay, Hutch. He'll see you now.

154
00:10:31,624 --> 00:10:34,184
Wait here, I'll be back in five minutes.

155
00:10:41,367 --> 00:10:43,528
Second door on the right.

156
00:10:43,803 --> 00:10:46,237
- How you doing?
- Hi, Hutch.

157
00:10:54,013 --> 00:10:57,471
- Hey, look what the wind blew in.
- Huggy Bear.

158
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:00,483
Hey, I want you to meet
my new partner, David Starsky.

159
00:11:00,653 --> 00:11:02,553
Hey, how you doing?

160
00:11:03,155 --> 00:11:05,680
Hey, nobody touches the Bear.

161
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:07,687
Have a seat.

162
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,556
- Hutch, the usual?
- You know it. Make it a double.

163
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,357
Get my boy a Jack and Tab.

164
00:11:12,531 --> 00:11:14,692
- And double that.
- You got it, boss.

165
00:11:14,867 --> 00:11:18,735
- I'll get a seltzer with lime, if you got it.
- I don't got it.

166
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:21,700
Or not. It's cool. I'm good.

167
00:11:21,874 --> 00:11:24,934
I just came by to apologize
for what happened in Chinatown.

168
00:11:25,111 --> 00:11:27,602
Let me tell you,
I was as surprised as you were.

169
00:11:27,781 --> 00:11:29,908
Don't sweat it, baby.
I wasn't surprised.

170
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,812
You know I ain't never surprised.

171
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:34,944
Hey, champ.

172
00:11:35,622 --> 00:11:38,147
You got a permit for that weapon
you're carrying?

173
00:11:38,325 --> 00:11:40,054
Starsky, please.

174
00:11:40,227 --> 00:11:42,923
No, I don't.

175
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:46,494
Yeah, me neither.

176
00:11:49,302 --> 00:11:52,032
I'm sorry, did I say something
that was funny?

177
00:11:53,707 --> 00:11:56,039
- Stop it. He's kidding.
- No, I'm not kidding.

178
00:11:56,209 --> 00:11:58,734
I wanna see permits
or I'm taking those weapons.

179
00:11:58,912 --> 00:12:01,608
Slow up, man.
Around here, we govern ourselves.

180
00:12:01,782 --> 00:12:04,444
Think of us like Luxembourg.

181
00:12:04,618 --> 00:12:06,279
- You dig?
- No, I don't dig.

182
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,920
See, Luxembourg's
a constitutional monarchy...

183
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:12,525
...a sovereign state established
after the Treaty of Vienna.

184
00:12:12,692 --> 00:12:17,186
Technically, it's a part of Europe.
But in reality, they govern themselves.

185
00:12:17,364 --> 00:12:20,094
- Like us.
- Just like us.

186
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,070
All right, enough, okay?

187
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,605
- Shit!
- Hold up! Hold up!

188
00:12:29,777 --> 00:12:31,802
Just chill out! Chill!
Watch yourself.

189
00:12:31,979 --> 00:12:33,947
- Oh, no. Hell, no.
- You okay?

190
00:12:34,115 --> 00:12:35,844
What happened?
Did he shoot Corky?

191
00:12:36,017 --> 00:12:37,951
Your boy shot his tail off.

192
00:12:38,119 --> 00:12:40,917
- He lost his tail?
- You should keep it in a terrarium.

193
00:12:41,189 --> 00:12:44,124
- Man, what the hell is a terrarium?
- What's a terrarium?

194
00:12:44,292 --> 00:12:48,490
It's an artificial ecosystem designed
to simulate Corky's natural habitat.

195
00:12:48,796 --> 00:12:51,765
Well, I can dig that.
But I say we shoot him in the ass.

196
00:12:51,933 --> 00:12:54,629
Oh, hell, yeah.
An eye for an eye.

197
00:12:54,802 --> 00:12:56,770
Take it easy.
Huggy, help me out here.

198
00:12:56,938 --> 00:13:00,237
Slow up, fellas. An iguana can lose
his tail and grow it back.

199
00:13:00,408 --> 00:13:03,935
He regenerates.
That's how he escapes his predator.

200
00:13:04,145 --> 00:13:07,603
It's true. It's a defense mechanism.
I read it in a magazine.

201
00:13:08,816 --> 00:13:13,480
So him shooting Corky's tail off
and us shooting him in the ass...

202
00:13:13,654 --> 00:13:17,681
...it really ain't the same thing.
- No, the punishment don't fit the crime.

203
00:13:17,859 --> 00:13:20,089
And besides,
it was an accident, right?

204
00:13:21,229 --> 00:13:22,457
Right.

205
00:13:23,364 --> 00:13:25,958
- So we're cool.
- We're always cool, breeze.

206
00:13:26,133 --> 00:13:28,227
Lower your pieces.

207
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:37,778
<i>Good morning, Bay City, you are tuned
in to KBA Y, 93.3 on your dial.</i>

208
00:13:37,946 --> 00:13:42,212
<i>This next tune is number eight on
the charts and number one in our hearts.</i>

209
00:14:26,762 --> 00:14:28,663
Hey, Hutch!

210
00:14:29,432 --> 00:14:31,923
Oh, there he is.
What's going on, Willis?

211
00:14:32,101 --> 00:14:33,659
Same old, same old.

212
00:14:33,836 --> 00:14:36,634
So how's life at the clink
treating you?

213
00:14:37,173 --> 00:14:38,435
It's not that great.

214
00:14:38,608 --> 00:14:42,442
I got some new tight-ass partner
that they stuck me with and then...

215
00:14:42,612 --> 00:14:46,104
I don't know. Hopefully...
It's probably not gonna last that long.

216
00:14:46,683 --> 00:14:50,119
- So got that $20 you owe me?
- 20?

217
00:14:50,286 --> 00:14:52,379
Willis, I thought it was 5.

218
00:14:52,555 --> 00:14:55,046
Hutch, that was my grandmother's
birthday money.

219
00:14:55,224 --> 00:14:58,887
Come on, give me a break, okay?
I just told you I got a new partner.

220
00:14:59,062 --> 00:15:03,931
Stuff isn't great for me down at the
precinct. You know, back off for a second.

221
00:15:06,102 --> 00:15:09,731
- Can I get it to you on Thursday?
- Fine, but no later than Thursday.

222
00:15:09,906 --> 00:15:12,067
No later than Thursday.
Word of honor.

223
00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:14,437
Cute little kid.

224
00:15:25,088 --> 00:15:27,956
It's 10:00. You're late.
I've been here since 8.

225
00:15:28,492 --> 00:15:31,984
8:00? I didn't know this place opened at 8.

226
00:15:32,162 --> 00:15:37,361
Well, don't sweat it, because crime called
in sick. It's gonna get a late start too.

227
00:15:39,169 --> 00:15:41,569
"Crime called in sick," I like that.

228
00:15:41,905 --> 00:15:45,636
- So, what's on the agenda today?
- Same as every day.

229
00:15:45,809 --> 00:15:49,745
- Finding bad guys, bringing them down.
- Great. Take my car, right there.

230
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,841
- That?
- Yeah.

231
00:15:52,016 --> 00:15:55,315
- What the hell is that?
- It's like a camper/pickup truck.

232
00:15:55,486 --> 00:15:57,454
- What's the matter?
- We're undercover.

233
00:15:57,621 --> 00:16:01,022
- That thing sticks out like a sore thumb.
- You think so?

234
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,225
You're in for a treat.

235
00:16:06,397 --> 00:16:08,456
It's not that bad.

236
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:31,245
Man, your stock just went up
in my book, my friend.

237
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:33,721
Pop the hood. Let's see
what you got under...

238
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:38,454
Hotshot, what do you think you're doing?
This is a Ford Gran Torino, okay?

239
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:42,157
It's not some crappy camper/apartment.
There are rules.

240
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,893
- Okay, okay.
- You do not bang on the hood.

241
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,800
You never, under any circumstances, drive.

242
00:16:47,972 --> 00:16:50,634
You will not put your coffee mug
on the roof. Okay?

243
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:55,337
No coffee in the car whatsoever. Coffee
on the ground, you get in the car, we go.

244
00:17:02,387 --> 00:17:06,721
<i>Attention, all units.
We've got a 61-40 at Bay City Marina.</i>

245
00:17:06,891 --> 00:17:08,324
Oh, no.

246
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,652
This is Zebra 3.
We're on it. Hang on.

247
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:21,865
You gotta be kidding me. No way.

248
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,031
- What?
- Floater.

249
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:28,340
Nothing harder to solve than a floater.
No prints, body's usually bloated...

250
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:32,712
...it's next to impossible.
All right, I say we push it out...

251
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,410
...hope the current
takes it to the next precinct.

252
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:37,783
- What?
- You'll thank me for this one.

253
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:40,820
- Hey, seriously, stop it.
- The key is not to pop it.

254
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:43,791
- Hey.
- You gotta be very ginger.

255
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:47,558
- What are you doing?
- I said, drop the stick.

256
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,531
You point a gun at me?
Okay, fine, have it your way.

257
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:52,136
Knock yourself out.

258
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:55,740
- What are you gonna solve, anyway?
- I'm gonna solve a murder.

259
00:17:56,942 --> 00:18:00,969
Monday, June 3rd. Male Caucasian body,
apparently dumped from the Bay Bridge.

260
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:05,345
Actually, there's no sign of impact,
so he was probably just dropped out at sea.

261
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:07,918
Could you please not talk
while I'm recording?

262
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,554
Thank you.

263
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:16,287
All right, I'm just gonna call
in the meat wagon, all right?

264
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:19,590
<i>Looks like you punched
your last ticket, amigo.</i>

265
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:22,557
I'm sorry, did you just tough-talk
a dead body?

266
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:24,430
I lost my flow.

267
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:31,875
<i>- Zebra 3 to base.
- Dispatch. Go ahead, Zebra 3.</i>

268
00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:36,072
We're gonna need a coroner notification.
We got a DB down at municipal jetty.

269
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:37,716
<i>10-4, will inform.</i>

270
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:41,217
Tell them to bring a body bag
and some galoshes. He's a wet one.

271
00:18:41,388 --> 00:18:43,288
<i>Copy that, Starsky.</i>

272
00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:47,425
Found a wallet.
Nothing in it.

273
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,424
- Medium-rare, okay?
- You got it.

274
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:51,928
Look at all these cops.
You wanna eat here?

275
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:54,498
It's a great place.
Pop's? Come on.

276
00:18:54,668 --> 00:18:57,068
"If you're one of the cops,
eat at Pop's."

277
00:18:57,404 --> 00:18:58,996
<i>- Okay, hot stuff.
- Zebra 3.</i>

278
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:01,163
<i>2- 11 in progress, please respond.</i>

279
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:03,138
<i>- Go for Starsky.
- Hurry, Starsky.</i>

280
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:06,711
We got two perps holding up
a gumball machine on 5th Street.

281
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,178
- Let's go.
- A gumball machine?

282
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:11,613
- Lethal force if necessary!

283
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,185
Very funny, Manetti.

284
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,690
Hey, it's Captain and Tennille.

285
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:21,885
That means one of you would
actually have to make captain.

286
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:25,963
- Radio's for police business only.
- That's true. Why'd they give you one?

287
00:19:26,934 --> 00:19:29,266
- Let's get out of here.
- Not that funny.

288
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:32,630
That Manetti really thinks he's something.
But you know what?

289
00:19:32,807 --> 00:19:35,799
- He's not.
- Take it easy.

290
00:19:38,145 --> 00:19:42,081
- You think that's funny?
- No, no, I mean, you just gotta rise above it.

291
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,445
- What do we got in the wallet?
- Not much.

292
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:49,886
Driver's license, couple receipts.
No cash whatsoever.

293
00:19:52,093 --> 00:19:54,459
"Reese Feldman Corporation."

294
00:19:54,629 --> 00:19:56,392
What do you call that?

295
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,335
<i>Terrence Meyers.</i>

296
00:20:07,508 --> 00:20:09,499
That name does sound vaguely familiar.

297
00:20:09,677 --> 00:20:12,737
- Isn't he part of our Nearly There program?
- I think he is.

298
00:20:13,281 --> 00:20:17,047
Terrence Meyers. Baby, isn't he
the guy dating a Bay City Kitty?

299
00:20:17,852 --> 00:20:19,581
Remember?
We were joking about it.

300
00:20:19,754 --> 00:20:22,348
Really? Bay City Kitty.
You mean the cheerleaders.

301
00:20:22,523 --> 00:20:24,582
You happen to remember her name?

302
00:20:25,527 --> 00:20:27,427
No, I don't.

303
00:20:28,563 --> 00:20:32,795
- Can I get you boys anything else?
- We're good. Thank you so much, honey.

304
00:20:33,268 --> 00:20:34,963
That's my angel. I love her.

305
00:20:36,171 --> 00:20:40,267
A second ago you mentioned
the Nearly There Foundation. What is that?

306
00:20:40,976 --> 00:20:44,707
That's a program that we set up
to help ex-cons get back on their feet.

307
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,247
Their parole requires them to have a job.
The Catch-22...

308
00:20:48,417 --> 00:20:51,113
...is not that many people
are excited to hire a felon.

309
00:20:51,286 --> 00:20:53,686
Those poor ex-cons,
they can't catch a break.

310
00:20:53,855 --> 00:20:56,380
No, it's a vicious cycle
they get caught up in.

311
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:00,961
<i>- Did you see the article in The New Times?
- Bet your ass I did. I love that writer.</i>

312
00:21:01,129 --> 00:21:05,156
But I'd be lying if I didn't say that we
get some pretty good tax breaks too.

313
00:21:05,334 --> 00:21:06,596
There it is, the kicker.

314
00:21:06,768 --> 00:21:09,066
- Just a perk.
- This sly dog here.

315
00:21:09,538 --> 00:21:12,234
- What do you got?
- Tickets to our annual fundraiser.

316
00:21:12,407 --> 00:21:15,035
- Be my guests.
- No, we can't accept gratuities.

317
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,700
It's against policy.

318
00:21:16,878 --> 00:21:21,144
These don't look like gratuities, they look
like tickets. I'd be happy to accept.

319
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:24,518
Hey, what about Terrence?
Is he in some kind of trouble?

320
00:21:24,921 --> 00:21:27,890
He's dead. His body washed up
in the marina this morning.

321
00:21:28,057 --> 00:21:29,285
Oh, no.

322
00:21:29,826 --> 00:21:33,455
"Punched his last ticket," as they say.

323
00:21:33,896 --> 00:21:38,731
You know, you try to do all you can for
these guys, but it's just never enough, is it?

324
00:21:38,901 --> 00:21:40,129
No, I guess it isn't.

325
00:21:40,303 --> 00:21:43,431
- When was the last time you saw him?
- The last place I saw...

326
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,598
This is a nice boat.

327
00:21:45,775 --> 00:21:49,006
- Reese, is this yours?
- Actually, that's a yacht.

328
00:21:49,178 --> 00:21:51,169
- I'm sorry, a yacht.
- Excuse me, Hutch.

329
00:21:51,347 --> 00:21:53,747
Can we please focus
on the investigation?

330
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:55,110
- Sure.
- Thank you.

331
00:21:56,019 --> 00:21:57,748
I could use another one of these.

332
00:22:27,718 --> 00:22:30,812
Right on! That was great, girls!
Take five!

333
00:22:32,489 --> 00:22:35,219
- Let's go.
- Look alive. Here they come.

334
00:22:35,526 --> 00:22:39,360
We usually don't allow spectators.
Even cute ones.

335
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:43,322
David Starsky, Bay City P.D.
My partner, Ken Hutchinson.

336
00:22:43,567 --> 00:22:46,092
- Girls.
- They're so cute.

337
00:22:46,537 --> 00:22:48,596
I'm Stacey. That's Holly.

338
00:22:48,772 --> 00:22:51,400
God, I loved your moves out there.
Fantastic.

339
00:22:52,009 --> 00:22:54,375
I've never dated a cop before.

340
00:22:54,545 --> 00:22:57,036
My horoscope said I should
try new things today.

341
00:22:57,214 --> 00:22:59,774
- Is that right?
- You're awful.

342
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:03,784
So, what brings you around here,
officers?

343
00:23:04,054 --> 00:23:06,249
Well, you know, that depends.

344
00:23:06,423 --> 00:23:09,415
Yeah. Either of you two know
a Terrence Meyers?

345
00:23:10,094 --> 00:23:12,460
- Oh, yeah, Heather dated him.
- Oh, yeah.

346
00:23:12,629 --> 00:23:16,963
The girl over there with the yellow top.
But they split up. We haven't seen him.

347
00:23:17,134 --> 00:23:19,659
- Let's go ask Heather some questions.
- Thank you.

348
00:23:19,837 --> 00:23:22,567
Be careful with those moves.
You could hurt someone.

349
00:23:22,739 --> 00:23:24,264
Oh, that's why we practice.

350
00:23:25,243 --> 00:23:27,575
Actually, I was talking about us.

351
00:23:30,515 --> 00:23:31,982
Where did that come from?

352
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:35,017
- I would've tried the horoscope line.
- No, too obvious.

353
00:23:35,186 --> 00:23:36,414
Hey!

354
00:23:36,588 --> 00:23:38,715
- Wait up.
- See what I mean?

355
00:23:40,658 --> 00:23:44,617
- Here's my number.
- In case you need us for...

356
00:23:45,096 --> 00:23:46,529
...questioning.

357
00:23:46,698 --> 00:23:48,029
Thank you, ladies.

358
00:23:48,199 --> 00:23:49,928
- Bye.
- Bye.

359
00:23:50,301 --> 00:23:53,566
He was always fascinated
by all that macho mobster bullshit.

360
00:23:53,805 --> 00:23:56,239
I hope this is okay.
I need to make this quick.

361
00:23:56,407 --> 00:23:59,433
- I gotta pick my kid up in 20 minutes.
- Oh, yeah, totally.

362
00:23:59,611 --> 00:24:02,546
We were gonna move in together.
He promised he'd quit...

363
00:24:02,714 --> 00:24:04,443
...that stuff after he got out.

364
00:24:04,616 --> 00:24:08,143
But then he goes and gets himself killed.
He's such an asshole.

365
00:24:09,587 --> 00:24:14,149
I can only imagine what you must
be going through. I think that...

366
00:24:14,526 --> 00:24:18,758
Honestly, you know, if I knew what
he was up to, I'd be happy to tell you.

367
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:21,364
But we didn't talk much.

368
00:24:22,133 --> 00:24:25,297
Yeah. So did you...?

369
00:24:26,305 --> 00:24:28,432
When did he...? Did he...?
What did...?

370
00:24:29,775 --> 00:24:35,338
- So Hutch, do you got any more questions?
- Yeah, well, sure. We could...

371
00:24:35,514 --> 00:24:37,505
What's your sign?

372
00:24:38,517 --> 00:24:40,314
Gemini.

373
00:24:40,753 --> 00:24:42,721
What...

374
00:24:43,389 --> 00:24:46,620
- What do you weigh?
- What does that have to do with anything?

375
00:24:46,792 --> 00:24:50,990
It has everything to do with anything.
Just answer the question, please, ma'am.

376
00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:59,093
Around 115, I guess,
give or take a pound or two.

377
00:24:59,738 --> 00:25:03,230
- I wish I could be more helpful.
- Stop.

378
00:25:03,409 --> 00:25:08,574
Don't do that. You've been great. I mean,
it's terrific. We got what we needed.

379
00:25:09,014 --> 00:25:11,005
Anything else?

380
00:25:12,518 --> 00:25:14,952
- I'm good.
- Yeah.

381
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,418
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

382
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:21,822
Oh, wait. I don't know if this
will be of any help. It's his.

383
00:25:21,994 --> 00:25:24,463
Take it. I don't want it.

384
00:25:26,666 --> 00:25:29,999
Okay. Thank you. Again.

385
00:25:34,374 --> 00:25:38,640
- Things getting any better at work, Hutch?
- Actually, work was pretty good today.

386
00:25:38,812 --> 00:25:41,076
- How about you? Anything new?
- Nope.

387
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:43,910
You get a chance to ask that girl out?

388
00:25:44,184 --> 00:25:46,709
I want you to meet
my new partner, David Starsky.

389
00:25:46,886 --> 00:25:48,114
Nice to meet you.

390
00:25:48,455 --> 00:25:50,889
Is this the dickweed
you were telling me about?

391
00:25:52,659 --> 00:25:55,287
Look, just shake his hand.
Come on.

392
00:25:55,495 --> 00:25:58,464
Go on, hop in. Willis.

393
00:25:58,632 --> 00:26:01,157
- Dickweed?
- His mom works late on Wednesdays...

394
00:26:01,334 --> 00:26:03,131
...so I kind of look after him.

395
00:26:03,303 --> 00:26:07,831
- You take a kid out on patrol with you?
- Yeah, that's what we do, isn't it, Willis?

396
00:26:08,008 --> 00:26:11,637
- Patrol!
- Whatever you say, Hutch.

397
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,436
Damn!

398
00:26:21,488 --> 00:26:25,220
- Man, this thing is bad!
- Don't encourage him.

399
00:26:29,497 --> 00:26:31,692
Oh, shit.

400
00:26:31,866 --> 00:26:33,959
Starsky, this your ride?

401
00:26:34,602 --> 00:26:38,800
Damn. You just moved up
a notch in my book.

402
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:40,634
That puts you at notch one.

403
00:26:41,942 --> 00:26:45,776
- I like your Lincoln.
- It's a '76. It won't be out till next year.

404
00:26:45,946 --> 00:26:48,915
I know people that know people
that robbed some people.

405
00:26:50,451 --> 00:26:52,851
So, what do you hear
on the street these days?

406
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:58,886
Dig this. A little bird tells me there's
gonna be a big coke deal in Bay City.

407
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:03,087
<i>- One for the Guinness Books, so they say.
- Interesting.</i>

408
00:27:03,264 --> 00:27:07,462
- Who would this little bird be?
- Look, I lay it out for y'all to play it out.

409
00:27:08,202 --> 00:27:10,670
All right. What does that mean?

410
00:27:11,272 --> 00:27:14,639
- Don't worry about it.
- Huggy, what can you tell us about this?

411
00:27:19,814 --> 00:27:22,248
This looks like the work of Big Earl.

412
00:27:22,416 --> 00:27:26,012
This boy loves dragons.
He makes these with his hands, you know?

413
00:27:26,588 --> 00:27:29,989
There's his name stitched right up
under the dragon's belly.

414
00:27:30,158 --> 00:27:34,060
- Big Earl?
- Yeah, he sews, but he's one tough mother.

415
00:27:34,229 --> 00:27:37,198
He owns a biker bar about
80 miles east of Route 4.

416
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:40,497
Biker bar?
What goes on down there?

417
00:27:40,969 --> 00:27:43,403
I don't know. Listen to Jim Croce...

418
00:27:43,572 --> 00:27:46,666
...play darts, whatever the hell else
you white people do.

419
00:27:46,842 --> 00:27:50,300
Look, fuzz, I gots to buzz.
This meeting is adjourned.

420
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,803
- That's it?
- That's it.

421
00:27:52,981 --> 00:27:57,509
- He lays it out for us to play it out.
- Oh, and by the way, this little meeting?

422
00:27:57,686 --> 00:28:00,052
- It never happened.
- What meeting?

423
00:28:00,222 --> 00:28:01,985
<i>C'est la vie, gentlemen.</i>

424
00:28:07,662 --> 00:28:09,892
- Great new technique
where you press hard.

425
00:28:10,065 --> 00:28:12,329
- Hands. What, it's a verbal technique?
- No.

426
00:28:12,501 --> 00:28:14,560
Keep your hands on me, I'm teasing.

427
00:28:15,337 --> 00:28:17,601
- What do you got on those cops?
- Everything.

428
00:28:17,773 --> 00:28:20,833
- Records, home addresses, credit history.
- Nice.

429
00:28:21,843 --> 00:28:25,405
- Starsky and Hutchinson?
- They call him Hutch, actually.

430
00:28:26,282 --> 00:28:28,443
I don't have enough
on my plate already?

431
00:28:28,618 --> 00:28:32,850
I got a major coke deal, my daughter's
bat mitzvah, which is a total nightmare.

432
00:28:33,022 --> 00:28:35,889
- And now these two guys.
- You think they're on to us?

433
00:28:36,726 --> 00:28:40,753
They are investigating a murder. That's
what cops do. It's why we pay taxes.

434
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:44,229
You're the worst. You kidding?
Will you look at these two guys?

435
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,528
He's cute, the blond.

436
00:28:47,703 --> 00:28:48,931
But I like dark hair.

437
00:28:49,105 --> 00:28:51,335
Maybe we ought to push
this whole thing.

438
00:28:51,507 --> 00:28:54,999
- Till things cool off?
- Kevin, please, with the worry.

439
00:28:55,178 --> 00:28:58,409
We're moving ahead as scheduled.
I'll handle those two clowns.

440
00:29:00,483 --> 00:29:04,214
So tomorrow, I say we check out
this biker bar, do a little deep cover.

441
00:29:04,387 --> 00:29:06,480
Sounds good.

442
00:29:07,123 --> 00:29:09,023
Who does your wig work?

443
00:29:09,292 --> 00:29:11,157
- I'm sorry, my what?
- Your wig work.

444
00:29:11,327 --> 00:29:13,295
Your undercover work, your disguises.

445
00:29:13,463 --> 00:29:16,296
- You have a wig guy?
- Oh, yeah, he's incredible.

446
00:29:16,466 --> 00:29:19,128
Well, if it isn't Sonny and Cher.

447
00:29:19,769 --> 00:29:22,432
- Sonny and Cher.
- Sit on it, Manetti.

448
00:29:22,706 --> 00:29:24,765
- Me sit on it?
- Yeah, you, sit on it.

449
00:29:24,942 --> 00:29:27,968
Why don't you sit on it, Starsky,
how's that sound?

450
00:29:28,245 --> 00:29:30,736
You wish.
Because I'm never sitting on it, ever.

451
00:29:31,048 --> 00:29:33,243
That's not what I heard.

452
00:29:35,819 --> 00:29:37,309
- Starsky!
- Come on. Come on!

453
00:29:37,488 --> 00:29:39,115
- Jesus!
- Stop it!

454
00:29:41,091 --> 00:29:45,118
What the hell is going on?
Cool your jets, Starsky!

455
00:29:45,696 --> 00:29:47,425
Everybody, back off!

456
00:29:48,265 --> 00:29:49,493
Including you, Manetti.

457
00:29:50,734 --> 00:29:53,134
I apologize, captain.
You're absolutely right.

458
00:29:53,337 --> 00:29:56,795
You know, you're not even worth it,
Starsky. And for the record...

459
00:29:56,974 --> 00:30:00,205
...those are hand towels.
The big towels are on the top shelf.

460
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:03,842
Hand towels. What a rod.

461
00:30:04,848 --> 00:30:09,876
Jesus Christ. He's right.
Go cover up.

462
00:31:20,525 --> 00:31:22,084
Who are you guys?

463
00:31:23,295 --> 00:31:27,061
My name's Kansas.
And this is my little man Toto.

464
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:32,100
We're Jesters from up in Big Cliff, coming
down and check out your place. This it?

465
00:31:32,271 --> 00:31:33,738
Is this your place?

466
00:31:33,906 --> 00:31:36,397
- Yeah.
- Nice.

467
00:31:36,575 --> 00:31:40,443
Tell me, if you two are Jesters,
what's our credo?

468
00:31:40,613 --> 00:31:42,410
Credo.

469
00:31:42,581 --> 00:31:44,071
Well...

470
00:31:44,249 --> 00:31:47,377
You almost got me there.
There's no credo.

471
00:31:49,288 --> 00:31:51,313
Other than the secret credo.

472
00:31:52,091 --> 00:31:55,424
It ain't no secret.
It's written right on our damn crest.

473
00:31:55,661 --> 00:31:59,654
A trick question? If it's printed on
the crest, you don't give it as a test.

474
00:31:59,832 --> 00:32:03,598
Anybody can read the crest. That wouldn't
prove we're Jesters. Not cool.

475
00:32:03,769 --> 00:32:06,966
- That's a fake mustache.
- Oh, really?

476
00:32:07,139 --> 00:32:12,338
Well, I wonder if you
think this is fake.

477
00:32:12,511 --> 00:32:16,345
- Now, we got some questions!
- I don't gotta give you nothing, cop!

478
00:32:17,383 --> 00:32:21,114
Wrong! First, you've gotta
give me a little respect.

479
00:32:21,286 --> 00:32:25,087
<i>Second, you're gonna give me some
answers, comprende, muchacho?</i>

480
00:32:35,301 --> 00:32:37,792
- I like your style.
- I like your moves.

481
00:32:37,971 --> 00:32:39,199
Now, where were we?

482
00:32:39,472 --> 00:32:41,804
You were gonna tell us
about Terrence Meyers.

483
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:44,468
Who's Terrence Meyers?

484
00:32:44,644 --> 00:32:48,410
- Wrong answer, Big Earl.
- Big Earl? I'm not Big Earl.

485
00:32:48,581 --> 00:32:51,914
- I'm Jeff.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

486
00:32:52,085 --> 00:32:54,076
- Jeff?
- No one's who they say they are.

487
00:32:54,254 --> 00:32:55,482
Look.

488
00:32:55,655 --> 00:32:58,146
Honest, think about it.
I'm not even big.

489
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:03,325
Yeah. No, that's a good point.

490
00:33:03,496 --> 00:33:07,626
Maybe it's an ironic name, like
Tiny over in Vice. He's, like, 8 feet tall.

491
00:33:07,801 --> 00:33:11,293
- Everybody says he's tiny...
- I know, except this guy's normal size.

492
00:33:11,471 --> 00:33:14,770
He'd have to be a lot smaller
for a name like Big Earl to be ironic.

493
00:33:14,941 --> 00:33:17,603
You don't have to be a midget.
You're not exactly...

494
00:33:17,777 --> 00:33:19,972
- How tall are you?
- I don't know, 5'9"?

495
00:33:20,447 --> 00:33:23,747
- Well, that is kind of... Basically...
- Borderline. It's average.

496
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:27,820
Look. Big Earl got pinched two weeks ago.
He's in Bay City Correctional.

497
00:33:27,988 --> 00:33:30,081
I took over the bar till he gets out.

498
00:33:30,257 --> 00:33:33,317
Jeff, I'm sorry.
We apologize.

499
00:33:33,494 --> 00:33:35,394
We're gonna pay Big Earl a visit.

500
00:33:35,563 --> 00:33:38,225
Let me get this for you.
There you go. Good as new.

501
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,095
A word of advice:
Next time you watch a place...

502
00:33:41,268 --> 00:33:43,759
...don't claim you own it
because you watch it.

503
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:48,602
I housesit for my sister all the time,
it's not like I claim that I own her house.

504
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:51,207
That goes for all y'all.

505
00:33:51,378 --> 00:33:53,539
Don't pretend to be
something you're not.

506
00:33:53,914 --> 00:33:55,347
Just be who you are.

507
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,544
That's what's really cool.

508
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:30,614
How did you get in?
Visiting hours are over.

509
00:34:31,887 --> 00:34:33,286
Special treatment.

510
00:34:33,455 --> 00:34:36,686
We got some questions
about Terrence Meyers.

511
00:34:36,858 --> 00:34:38,621
- Terrence Meyers?
- Yeah.

512
00:34:38,794 --> 00:34:40,421
You made this jacket for him?

513
00:34:41,363 --> 00:34:44,799
Gee whiz, I don't seem to know anyone
by that name at all.

514
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:47,397
Hard customer.

515
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:50,168
Offer him a radio or some bullshit.

516
00:34:50,539 --> 00:34:53,440
Maybe we can make your stay
a little more comfortable.

517
00:34:53,608 --> 00:34:57,408
- Nice transistor radio for your cell?
- No.

518
00:34:57,579 --> 00:35:00,946
- How about a TV?
- I tell you what.

519
00:35:01,116 --> 00:35:03,914
I do like your blonde friend, here.

520
00:35:04,953 --> 00:35:07,148
Let me see your bellybutton.

521
00:35:08,223 --> 00:35:10,691
No. What... Let's go. Come on.

522
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:12,520
- No, listen.
- No, no! I'm not...

523
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:14,321
Hold on.
He's obviously a freak.

524
00:35:14,496 --> 00:35:17,260
Just show him a little skin.
Show him your stomach.

525
00:35:17,432 --> 00:35:18,831
Nobody's here.
Come on.

526
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,194
- Are we cool?
- Yes, we're cool.

527
00:35:26,309 --> 00:35:30,439
Oh, eureka.
God, that's nice.

528
00:35:30,613 --> 00:35:33,514
It's like a little bowl of oatmeal
with a hole in it.

529
00:35:33,683 --> 00:35:35,674
- I got one too.
- Oh, come on.

530
00:35:35,885 --> 00:35:38,820
I just got a little more
brown sugar on mine.

531
00:35:39,055 --> 00:35:41,785
Did you say "Terrence Meyers"?

532
00:35:42,158 --> 00:35:46,219
Yeah, I think I did make that jacket.
We might have pulled a job together.

533
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:49,228
What job? Who were you working for?

534
00:35:49,832 --> 00:35:52,392
Stand up. Walk to the back
and do a spin for me.

535
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:55,036
Wait a second.
I just showed you my stomach...

536
00:35:55,338 --> 00:35:56,999
Come on, a deal's a deal, Earl.

537
00:35:57,173 --> 00:36:01,109
Fine, then this conversation is over.

538
00:36:02,111 --> 00:36:03,578
Wait. Wait.

539
00:36:03,746 --> 00:36:06,010
<i>- Hold it. Come on. Wait.
- I can't hear you.</i>

540
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,915
Get up.

541
00:36:14,657 --> 00:36:18,093
- Tell him to take his jacket off.
- Take your jacket off.

542
00:36:19,061 --> 00:36:22,896
- Slow spin.
- He says to do a slow spin.

543
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,068
Tell him to arch his back
and then look back at me, mean.

544
00:36:27,237 --> 00:36:28,534
Like a dragon.

545
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:35,901
He says to arch your back
and look back at him, mean, like a dragon.

546
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,172
But keep it mean.

547
00:36:55,098 --> 00:36:57,259
Tell him great job.
He can sit down.

548
00:36:57,701 --> 00:37:01,569
You're a very convincing dragon.
You should feel good about that.

549
00:37:01,738 --> 00:37:04,229
Just get this over with.

550
00:37:04,441 --> 00:37:06,102
Okay, here's the deal.

551
00:37:06,276 --> 00:37:09,905
Terrence and I worked as extra muscle
for a couple of dealers.

552
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,310
I'd like to tell you who,
but I don't know.

553
00:37:12,482 --> 00:37:14,746
I never got a name,
I never got a face.

554
00:37:14,918 --> 00:37:16,317
But I do know one thing:

555
00:37:19,723 --> 00:37:22,693
They paid us in coke.
I was pretty pissed at the time.

556
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,192
I was hoping to get cash.
I'm no coke dealer.

557
00:37:25,363 --> 00:37:27,160
Right, so where's the coke?

558
00:37:27,332 --> 00:37:29,766
If we find that coke,
we can probably trace it.

559
00:37:29,934 --> 00:37:32,903
Fine. Fine.

560
00:37:33,071 --> 00:37:35,301
Look, I like you guys, okay?

561
00:37:35,473 --> 00:37:38,465
Especially you. Okay?
Don't feel bad about that.

562
00:37:38,643 --> 00:37:40,634
But I like you guys, so I'll tell you.

563
00:37:41,012 --> 00:37:42,536
But...

564
00:37:42,714 --> 00:37:46,172
But first I need to see something, okay?

565
00:37:47,185 --> 00:37:49,153
And it's gonna involve both of you.

566
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,220
I'm not gonna lie to you.

567
00:37:51,389 --> 00:37:53,254
It's gonna get weird.

568
00:37:53,958 --> 00:37:56,085
Two dragons.

569
00:38:00,531 --> 00:38:04,126
Ready? Both of you, take your shirts off.

570
00:38:04,302 --> 00:38:05,929
But do it slow.

571
00:38:24,189 --> 00:38:27,090
I guess it's supposed
to rain later tonight.

572
00:38:27,259 --> 00:38:29,557
Yeah, that's what I heard.

573
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:35,466
- Look, you know, what happened...
- Can we please not talk about this, Hutch?

574
00:38:35,634 --> 00:38:38,159
We got the coke.
Let's not ever talk about it.

575
00:38:38,737 --> 00:38:41,365
You're right.
That's a good policy.

576
00:38:42,241 --> 00:38:44,641
We got what we came for.

577
00:38:46,945 --> 00:38:50,403
- You think dragons ever...
- Stop, I don't want to talk about it!

578
00:39:06,398 --> 00:39:09,333
What the hell is wrong with you two?

579
00:39:10,702 --> 00:39:13,535
- Come on, what are you...?
- You have brought disgrace...

580
00:39:13,705 --> 00:39:15,969
...on everyone who's
ever worn a uniform.

581
00:39:16,141 --> 00:39:18,109
My God.

582
00:39:18,277 --> 00:39:21,213
- We didn't know there was a camera.
- Cap, we're sorry.

583
00:39:21,381 --> 00:39:22,780
At least we got the stash.

584
00:39:22,949 --> 00:39:25,543
There's gotta be 30 grams
of coke here, minimum.

585
00:39:25,718 --> 00:39:28,846
This could lead us to the dealers
that iced Terrence Meyers.

586
00:39:29,022 --> 00:39:31,820
It's evidence.
We can print the bag, run forensics.

587
00:39:31,991 --> 00:39:34,983
We did.
We got nothing.

588
00:39:35,161 --> 00:39:40,064
What we got is a bag
of artificial sweetener.

589
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:42,494
What are you talking about?

590
00:39:42,669 --> 00:39:44,660
My granny wouldn't think
this was coke.

591
00:39:44,838 --> 00:39:48,467
Come on, that's impossible.
We got the stuff from Big Earl.

592
00:39:48,641 --> 00:39:51,041
- I'm taking you two off this floater.
- What?

593
00:39:51,578 --> 00:39:54,809
- I'm giving it to Manetti.
- Manetti? Oh, come on, cap!

594
00:39:54,981 --> 00:39:58,348
- Manetti's the worst cop on the force!
- Starsky. Stop.

595
00:39:58,518 --> 00:40:02,045
Go on, sit down.
Come on.

596
00:40:03,756 --> 00:40:08,420
Look, captain, we're sorry, but come on.
You can't take us off this.

597
00:40:08,595 --> 00:40:11,063
I just did. Now, leave.

598
00:40:14,865 --> 00:40:18,164
And take your bag
of artificial sweetener with you.

599
00:40:20,438 --> 00:40:23,965
- Kicking the chair was a nice touch.
- Yeah, too bad it didn't work.

600
00:40:24,141 --> 00:40:25,608
He'll get over it.

601
00:40:25,776 --> 00:40:29,075
What I can't figure out is why Earl
got paid with bunk cocaine.

602
00:40:29,247 --> 00:40:30,737
Now we've got two leads.

603
00:40:30,915 --> 00:40:33,440
- We do?
- Stacey and Holly.

604
00:40:33,618 --> 00:40:36,746
- Those two cheerleaders?
- No, no, those two witnesses.

605
00:40:36,921 --> 00:40:38,183
They met Terrence.

606
00:40:39,423 --> 00:40:41,983
Let's take them out,
see what we can learn.

607
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:46,596
I mean, is it our fault that they also
happen to be a couple of hot foxes?

608
00:40:47,131 --> 00:40:49,622
Reese, I couldn't help myself.
They were cops.

609
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,268
<i>- They were just too macho.
- Macho?</i>

610
00:40:52,603 --> 00:40:55,800
<i>- It's simple. You should have lied.
- I did. I lied about you.</i>

611
00:40:55,973 --> 00:40:57,736
I didn't tell them anything.

612
00:40:57,909 --> 00:41:00,639
But I had to give them something.
They were so pure.

613
00:41:00,811 --> 00:41:03,712
You're lucky you're in the joint.
Do you understand me?

614
00:41:04,115 --> 00:41:06,242
<i>- Look at the bright side.
- Bright side?</i>

615
00:41:06,417 --> 00:41:09,477
It's the ultimate test.
The coke was in the police station.

616
00:41:09,654 --> 00:41:11,952
They cleared it.
You should be happy.

617
00:41:12,123 --> 00:41:14,557
Well, guess what?
I'm not happy.

618
00:41:14,725 --> 00:41:16,852
I'm not happy at all about it, Earl!

619
00:41:17,028 --> 00:41:19,725
Don't shush me!
Don't tell me to calm down!

620
00:41:19,898 --> 00:41:22,059
- Understand?
- What are you wearing? Quick.

621
00:41:22,234 --> 00:41:23,701
What am I wearing?

622
00:41:23,869 --> 00:41:27,032
Silk flowered shirt and a vest. Why?

623
00:41:27,306 --> 00:41:28,967
<i>That's gorgeous.</i>

624
00:41:29,141 --> 00:41:33,202
- You sick son of a bitch.
- Don't hang up. Don't hang up!

625
00:41:35,981 --> 00:41:38,609
God. Some people.

626
00:41:39,985 --> 00:41:42,681
I'm not gonna be able
to fit in my uniform tomorrow.

627
00:41:42,854 --> 00:41:44,321
Is that a good or bad thing?

628
00:41:46,191 --> 00:41:48,751
Is this the way you two
always treat witnesses?

629
00:41:48,927 --> 00:41:53,421
Well, that depends. If it's a misdemeanor,
we've been known to skip the fondue...

630
00:41:53,598 --> 00:41:56,465
...and move right to foot massages.
Let me see.

631
00:41:56,635 --> 00:41:59,866
Watch out! Wait a minute,
I think that's police brutality.

632
00:42:00,038 --> 00:42:02,973
- Anybody for some coffee?
- No, thanks.

633
00:42:03,141 --> 00:42:05,541
<i>Okay, one for le chef.</i>

634
00:42:06,945 --> 00:42:09,778
Wow. This place is great.

635
00:42:15,587 --> 00:42:17,555
It serves my needs.
It's cozy. Homey.

636
00:42:17,723 --> 00:42:20,090
- Can you help me find the sugar?
- It's there.

637
00:42:20,259 --> 00:42:22,454
Hutch, help me find the sugar.

638
00:42:24,263 --> 00:42:26,754
- Okay. Pardon me.
- Okay.

639
00:42:26,966 --> 00:42:28,490
- How we doing?
- Great.

640
00:42:28,668 --> 00:42:30,829
- Your fondue put us over the top.
- Really?

641
00:42:31,004 --> 00:42:33,700
Which one do you like?
We're gonna stick to this.

642
00:42:33,873 --> 00:42:36,433
- I have a thing for blondes.
- Good. I'll take anything.

643
00:42:37,076 --> 00:42:38,737
They're sweet little angels.

644
00:42:39,178 --> 00:42:41,669
In two minutes,
I want you to grab my guitar...

645
00:42:41,848 --> 00:42:44,544
...bring it to me,
put it in my hands and step back.

646
00:42:44,717 --> 00:42:47,550
- You play?
- Just bring me the guitar.

647
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,518
Wait. Hey, hey, where's the sugar?

648
00:42:50,723 --> 00:42:52,748
I don't think I have any.

649
00:42:53,092 --> 00:42:55,151
- That's great. He's a cop.
- Come here.

650
00:42:55,328 --> 00:42:57,057
- Both of you.
- You're so funny.

651
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:59,528
It's like a magpie convention in here.

652
00:42:59,699 --> 00:43:02,167
Let's get the cup out.

653
00:43:06,105 --> 00:43:08,300
Thank you, Big Earl.

654
00:43:09,675 --> 00:43:13,941
Do you ever get scared out there,
on the streets?

655
00:43:14,113 --> 00:43:18,813
Yeah. I'd like to say no,
but the truth is, I do sometimes.

656
00:43:20,087 --> 00:43:24,148
I'm one of those guys that's more about
helping others than helping myself.

657
00:43:24,324 --> 00:43:27,088
- There we go.
- It's all I knew.

658
00:43:27,261 --> 00:43:30,321
It's more that there's someone
I might not be able to help.

659
00:43:30,497 --> 00:43:34,957
A citizen that needs aid,
or even an animal.

660
00:43:35,135 --> 00:43:37,695
- Look what I found.
- Put that away. Put it away!

661
00:43:37,871 --> 00:43:40,840
Hutch, you gotta play.
Come on. Play, play. Please.

662
00:43:41,008 --> 00:43:43,169
Don't you wanna play?
Come on. Hutch!

663
00:43:43,811 --> 00:43:45,779
All right. Holly, turn off the music.

664
00:43:45,946 --> 00:43:47,311
- Now, come on!
- Oh, sorry.

665
00:43:47,481 --> 00:43:49,415
Look alive. Let's go.

666
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:53,177
- Hutch is gonna play.
- What have you gotten me into, Starsky?

667
00:43:53,353 --> 00:43:57,187
- Thought we were partners.
- Come on, Hutch!

668
00:43:59,093 --> 00:44:01,789
One, two, three.

669
00:45:01,789 --> 00:45:04,019
- That was great, Hutch!
- Come on, you guys.

670
00:45:04,192 --> 00:45:07,423
It was just a guy here with a guitar,
singing his heart out.

671
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:10,998
Starsky's bored.

672
00:45:12,634 --> 00:45:14,534
- Anybody else bored?
- What?

673
00:45:14,702 --> 00:45:16,636
- A club could be fun.
- Club. Yeah.

674
00:45:16,804 --> 00:45:19,535
Okay, I'll get some more coffee
and then we'll go.

675
00:45:19,875 --> 00:45:21,069
Is he okay?

676
00:45:49,138 --> 00:45:50,765
Isn't this place great?

677
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:52,498
Do you like places like this?

678
00:45:52,675 --> 00:45:55,371
You're a cheerleader,
so you're dancing in formation.

679
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:58,638
This place can't be fun,
because it's like you're at work.

680
00:45:58,814 --> 00:46:01,044
Are you okay?
You seem kind of wound up.

681
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:03,583
Wound up?
No, I'm just pumped. I'm excited.

682
00:46:03,752 --> 00:46:07,654
Rock-solid, ready to go. A little bit
paranoid, but feeling really good.

683
00:46:07,823 --> 00:46:10,383
- Can I kiss you?
- Okay.

684
00:46:12,428 --> 00:46:14,157
- Watch it, man.
- Excuse me?

685
00:46:14,463 --> 00:46:17,865
I said, watch it. Floor's for dancing.
You can tell by the lights.

686
00:46:18,068 --> 00:46:20,036
- Wanna tangle, curly?
- Come on. No.

687
00:46:20,203 --> 00:46:22,137
- No, we're gonna dance.
- No, no, no.

688
00:46:22,305 --> 00:46:24,603
Curly wants to tangle.

689
00:46:24,941 --> 00:46:28,308
- Do you really want a piece of this?
- I don't want a piece.

690
00:46:29,012 --> 00:46:31,480
I want the whole thing.

691
00:46:32,983 --> 00:46:34,507
Yeah!

692
00:46:34,684 --> 00:46:37,380
- Oh, my, folks!
- Please don't do this.

693
00:46:37,554 --> 00:46:39,886
- Don't worry. I can take him.
- It's not that.

694
00:46:40,056 --> 00:46:42,524
You shouldn't do this
because it's so lame.

695
00:46:42,692 --> 00:46:45,422
Tonight, our own Dancing Rick
is being called out...

696
00:46:45,595 --> 00:46:48,996
...by new guy David Stamsky.
- No, no, Starsky.

697
00:46:49,165 --> 00:46:51,963
Back at you.
If you've got a pair of sunglasses...

698
00:46:52,135 --> 00:46:57,596
...l'd put them on, because I got a feeling
these two are gonna light it up!

699
00:46:58,341 --> 00:47:00,935
Boz, reel it in!

700
00:47:03,146 --> 00:47:05,671
All right, settle down.
Everybody settle.

701
00:47:05,849 --> 00:47:08,613
You know the rules.
Keep it safe, keep it sexy...

702
00:47:08,785 --> 00:47:12,050
...and above all, turn up the night!

703
00:47:14,991 --> 00:47:16,982
Dancing Rick getting warmed up here.

704
00:47:17,161 --> 00:47:19,823
What's he gonna bring out
for the appetizer course?

705
00:47:19,997 --> 00:47:24,696
Oh, it's a little hand-over-hand tuggle, man,
right into the center of the floor.

706
00:47:27,438 --> 00:47:28,928
That's all he's giving him.

707
00:47:29,106 --> 00:47:31,040
That's a bucketful of confidence.

708
00:47:31,208 --> 00:47:34,473
Over to new guy David Starsky.

709
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,410
This guy could be trouble.

710
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:43,346
It's the Wild West.
Those are six-guns full of sexy.

711
00:47:43,521 --> 00:47:47,457
The good, the bad and the groovy.

712
00:47:47,625 --> 00:47:50,594
One, two, three, four,
we've got disco war, folks.

713
00:47:53,097 --> 00:47:56,863
Dancing Rick's going, "I don't like you,
but I respect your moves."

714
00:47:57,034 --> 00:47:59,662
Here comes Starsky again.

715
00:47:59,837 --> 00:48:04,274
Driving that disco big rig.
Shift gears, blow your funky horn.

716
00:48:04,442 --> 00:48:08,469
Pull into the truck stop and get yourself
some scrapple made out of sexy.

717
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:13,546
Disco Rick brings it right back
and he's not wasting any time, folks.

718
00:48:13,718 --> 00:48:17,746
From the future of 1984,
that's a funky disco robot.

719
00:48:18,757 --> 00:48:22,454
They're both on the floor, folks,
eye to eye. It's disco Vietnam.

720
00:48:22,627 --> 00:48:24,822
Neither one's blinking or backing down.

721
00:48:24,996 --> 00:48:26,395
Let's see what happens.

722
00:48:26,898 --> 00:48:29,833
Angry cat.
Kitten has claws.

723
00:48:30,001 --> 00:48:33,266
All right, looks like it's over.
Remember, $2 Harvey Wall...

724
00:48:33,438 --> 00:48:36,930
Oh, my God!
David Starsky, taking it over the line!

725
00:48:45,984 --> 00:48:48,418
How about that?
Very sexy, very macho.

726
00:48:48,587 --> 00:48:50,646
But that's a little too close to call.

727
00:48:50,822 --> 00:48:54,588
We'll have to depend on our patented
American Lights Applause-O-Meter.

728
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:58,958
So let's bring out our combatants, folks.
Come on, big hand for them.

729
00:48:59,464 --> 00:49:01,557
Here we go.

730
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:06,394
First off, over to my man,
Dancing Rick.

731
00:49:08,173 --> 00:49:12,166
And over to the new guy,
David Starsky.

732
00:49:13,645 --> 00:49:15,943
Folks, pretty close.
I hate to do this...

733
00:49:16,114 --> 00:49:18,811
...but I gotta give it to my man
Dancing Rick.

734
00:49:18,985 --> 00:49:20,885
<i>Boo! Boo!</i>

735
00:49:21,053 --> 00:49:23,783
What? Hey, hey, do it again!
That's B.S.

736
00:49:23,956 --> 00:49:26,186
- What?
- I won. Do the applause thing again!

737
00:49:26,359 --> 00:49:28,156
It was just for fun. Forget it...

738
00:49:28,327 --> 00:49:30,761
- I said, do it again, liar!
- Not cool, not cool!

739
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:33,296
- Liar! Do it again!
- All right.

740
00:49:33,466 --> 00:49:36,367
Hey, hey, settle down.
Settle down.

741
00:49:36,536 --> 00:49:38,470
I'm a cop. It's cool.

742
00:49:40,139 --> 00:49:41,401
It's okay.

743
00:49:43,543 --> 00:49:46,171
It's okay, it's okay!
Calm down, people.

744
00:49:46,345 --> 00:49:50,042
Bay City P.D.
We got him.

745
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:53,014
We're gonna get you home.

746
00:49:53,753 --> 00:49:55,618
- Where am I?
- You were freaking out.

747
00:49:55,788 --> 00:49:58,689
- I had to take you down.
- What?

748
00:50:01,427 --> 00:50:03,122
There we go.

749
00:50:03,296 --> 00:50:05,594
Easy does it.

750
00:50:06,232 --> 00:50:08,166
Here we go.

751
00:50:11,504 --> 00:50:13,665
I think I was drugged.

752
00:50:14,974 --> 00:50:16,374
Sounds like you did coke.

753
00:50:18,612 --> 00:50:21,513
I mean, from what I've read
about the effects.

754
00:50:21,682 --> 00:50:25,914
I don't use coke.
I had coffee tonight.

755
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:32,085
- What is that?
- Sweetener, right?

756
00:50:32,259 --> 00:50:34,921
The stuff from Earl?
What are you doing with this?

757
00:50:35,095 --> 00:50:36,756
- Hutch?
- Where'd you get this?

758
00:50:37,464 --> 00:50:40,092
- I beat that guy. What was that about?
- You did.

759
00:50:40,267 --> 00:50:44,465
- You won. You danced your heart out.
- And everybody saw it.

760
00:50:44,638 --> 00:50:45,935
- Sleep.
- I was robbed.

761
00:50:46,106 --> 00:50:49,974
I know. We was robbed.
We was robbed.

762
00:50:50,177 --> 00:50:51,439
Go to sleep.

763
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:58,342
Go to sleep, tiny dancer. All right.

764
00:50:58,652 --> 00:51:00,279
Jesus Christ.

765
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:06,252
- Is he okay?
- Oh, yeah, he's okay.

766
00:51:06,426 --> 00:51:09,020
He just needs to sleep it off.

767
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:11,894
Quite a night, huh?

768
00:51:12,199 --> 00:51:14,497
You can say that again.

769
00:51:14,935 --> 00:51:17,632
Guess it's kind of winding down.

770
00:51:17,805 --> 00:51:21,366
- Well, it doesn't have to be over.
- What do you mean?

771
00:51:26,748 --> 00:51:29,308
Where did that come from?

772
00:51:32,954 --> 00:51:36,321
I just want you to know,
I really like your partner.

773
00:51:36,491 --> 00:51:40,587
- I know, he's such a good guy.
- This is just, like, whatever.

774
00:51:40,762 --> 00:51:44,095
I don't think we even have to judge it.
It's too natural.

775
00:51:44,265 --> 00:51:45,823
- Okay.
- It's just...

776
00:51:46,501 --> 00:51:49,265
You guys wanna kiss? Yeah.

777
00:52:03,451 --> 00:52:07,478
I hear somebody stirring.
There he is.

778
00:52:07,989 --> 00:52:10,184
I feel for you.

779
00:52:12,026 --> 00:52:14,654
Jesus! Please, turn that off!

780
00:52:14,829 --> 00:52:17,822
Easy, killer.
Just a blender.

781
00:52:19,435 --> 00:52:23,701
- What time is it?
- Time for Hutch's hangover cure.

782
00:52:24,039 --> 00:52:27,065
- What's in it?
- Pepto-Bismol, Aunt Jemima mix...

783
00:52:27,242 --> 00:52:29,176
...Tang and a little flat Tab.

784
00:52:29,345 --> 00:52:31,575
Most important thing.

785
00:52:32,715 --> 00:52:34,080
And a raw egg.

786
00:52:34,783 --> 00:52:37,513
Saves lives. Trust me.

787
00:52:39,922 --> 00:52:41,219
And?

788
00:52:45,094 --> 00:52:47,324
- It's good.
- What did I tell you?

789
00:52:48,163 --> 00:52:49,790
Sorry about last night.

790
00:52:49,965 --> 00:52:54,095
- Thanks for taking care of the girls.
- Hey, no problem. Happy to do it.

791
00:52:54,269 --> 00:52:57,727
What are partners for?
Speaking of which...

792
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:03,000
...I checked this stuff out and even though
it tastes like sugar, that is cocaine.

793
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:07,110
- You sure?
- I'm sure...

794
00:53:07,282 --> 00:53:10,547
...Stacey's sure, Holly's sure...

795
00:53:11,754 --> 00:53:13,187
How do you like your eggs?

796
00:53:13,589 --> 00:53:17,219
Didn't Huggy mention something
about a coke deal going down?

797
00:53:17,394 --> 00:53:19,828
"One for the Guinness Book,"
was how he put it.

798
00:53:19,996 --> 00:53:21,793
Seems like a big coincidence.

799
00:53:21,965 --> 00:53:23,956
Why don't I drive?
You don't look good.

800
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:26,830
No. If I'm alive, I drive.

801
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:28,834
Rhyming already, you must be...

802
00:53:36,746 --> 00:53:38,008
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

803
00:53:38,181 --> 00:53:40,581
He blew out my fricking window!

804
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:44,042
All right! Enough with the car!
We get it!

805
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:46,914
Stop shooting my car!

806
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:49,081
Okay, cover me. Say when.

807
00:53:49,259 --> 00:53:50,886
Go!

808
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:55,295
Zebra to base,
I want you to run a plate.

809
00:53:55,532 --> 00:53:58,057
Larry, one, apple, nine, eight, four.

810
00:53:58,234 --> 00:54:01,260
Larry, one, apple, nine, eight, four.

811
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:02,833
- Damn it!
- You okay?

812
00:54:03,006 --> 00:54:06,271
Look at this! This is horrible!

813
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:09,941
What kind of world do we live in
where somebody does this?

814
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:13,276
Well, I think he was aiming at us.

815
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:16,278
Think this is funny?
Seriously, is this funny?

816
00:54:16,454 --> 00:54:20,288
<i>Zebra 3, we have an ID on that plate.
Lee M. Chau, 1325 Western.</i>

817
00:54:20,658 --> 00:54:23,286
<i>- I repeat...
- Ready to dish out a little payback?</i>

818
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:58,886
Freeze! Bay City P.D.!

819
00:55:01,699 --> 00:55:04,133
- The hell was that?
- I think it's his kid.

820
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:09,739
All right, just sit tight, little boy.
Well, well, well, this looks familiar.

821
00:55:09,907 --> 00:55:13,138
Possession of cocaine and
attempted murder, huh?

822
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,040
- Jesus!
- What was that?

823
00:55:16,181 --> 00:55:21,346
That ain't a kid! It's a tiny little man!
And he's got knives! Goddamn!

824
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,147
- My arm!
- Oh, shit!

825
00:55:26,024 --> 00:55:30,586
Make him stop! Make him stop!
Tell him to stop! Stop it!

826
00:55:36,668 --> 00:55:39,933
Starsky! Starsky, we need to go now!
Come on!

827
00:55:40,105 --> 00:55:41,902
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

828
00:55:45,644 --> 00:55:48,169
All right, now...

829
00:55:48,346 --> 00:55:53,249
Okay, time out. Let's just take a little break.
I'm gonna get out of here... Jeez!

830
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:57,254
Oh, mama! What is your problem?

831
00:55:57,956 --> 00:56:00,117
I said, time out!

832
00:56:02,227 --> 00:56:05,060
Hutch! A little help.

833
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:10,293
He pinned you good, partner.
On three. One, two...

834
00:56:11,136 --> 00:56:13,127
Time to answer some questions,
old man.

835
00:56:13,305 --> 00:56:16,867
Who's the little dwarf you got
throwing knives at me and my partner?

836
00:56:17,043 --> 00:56:19,204
That was no dwarf. That was my son.

837
00:56:19,378 --> 00:56:21,369
Liar!

838
00:56:21,781 --> 00:56:23,942
Come on, you're going downtown.

839
00:56:24,116 --> 00:56:27,176
Let's go, Starsky. On your feet!

840
00:56:53,679 --> 00:56:57,171
Now, you wanna tell me
who hired you?

841
00:56:58,351 --> 00:57:03,186
We have a saying in Koreatown.
It goes, "Kiss my yellow ass, copper!"

842
00:57:04,156 --> 00:57:09,116
All right. You wanna play games?
I got a game for you, Chau.

843
00:57:13,132 --> 00:57:15,465
Let's play a little Russian roulette.

844
00:57:18,005 --> 00:57:20,303
We got a little saying here in Bay City:

845
00:57:21,909 --> 00:57:23,501
"You cross the line...

846
00:57:25,512 --> 00:57:26,774
...your nuts are mine."

847
00:57:26,947 --> 00:57:29,939
There's really a bullet in the gun.

848
00:57:30,117 --> 00:57:33,609
- Yes, I know. That is the point...
- No, you don't understand.

849
00:57:33,787 --> 00:57:35,846
- Let's play!
- The bullet went inside!

850
00:57:36,023 --> 00:57:39,720
Come on, you wanna play,
let's play! Let's play!

851
00:57:40,427 --> 00:57:41,689
- Your turn!
- No!

852
00:57:41,862 --> 00:57:46,697
I thought you wanted to play. Come on,
Chau. You wanna play? Let's play a game!

853
00:57:47,067 --> 00:57:51,197
- What are you doing? Jesus.
- Our little friend here is about to talk.

854
00:57:51,371 --> 00:57:52,599
What in the holy...?

855
00:58:03,350 --> 00:58:07,252
- All right, enough with the talking. Let's go.
- What? No! Starsky, no!

856
00:58:11,525 --> 00:58:15,656
- You're crazy!
- Are you out of your mind?

857
00:58:17,131 --> 00:58:18,962
Calm down.

858
00:58:19,133 --> 00:58:24,264
Calm down? He tried to kill me. He shoot
everything. I have heart attack already.

859
00:58:24,472 --> 00:58:27,202
It's over. It's over.
Just calm down.

860
00:58:37,752 --> 00:58:40,482
- What?
- No, nothing. Nothing. This guy is funny.

861
00:58:40,655 --> 00:58:44,091
- It's not about you.
- That's great. He can be your new partner.

862
00:58:44,258 --> 00:58:46,453
Chau and Hutch. Sounds cool.

863
00:58:46,627 --> 00:58:52,293
Forget it. All right, Chau, what else can
you tell me about the guys that hired you?

864
00:58:52,467 --> 00:58:57,700
Not much. A couple of whiteys.
Nice suit. Perry Ellis.

865
00:58:57,872 --> 00:59:00,033
They pay, I do job.

866
00:59:00,208 --> 00:59:02,574
- What did they look like?
- I don't know.

867
00:59:02,744 --> 00:59:06,111
They were white.
All you guys look alike to me.

868
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:12,417
That's funny, all you guys
look alike to us. Orientals.

869
00:59:13,622 --> 00:59:15,112
So where'd you meet him?

870
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:20,592
We met... How do you say? By water.

871
00:59:20,763 --> 00:59:24,824
- At the beach?
- No, no, no. On water.

872
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,460
- Right, a boat. You met on a boat.
- No, no, no. Not a boat.

873
00:59:30,005 --> 00:59:31,438
It's a yacht.

874
01:00:16,453 --> 01:00:20,321
Rock into womanhood, Elizabeth!
We know that you will.

875
01:00:21,624 --> 01:00:23,216
- All right.
- What's that mean?

876
01:00:23,393 --> 01:00:27,386
We have a special delivery for
the little lady. It's right over here.

877
01:00:27,564 --> 01:00:28,861
Let's see what's inside.

878
01:00:53,323 --> 01:00:56,588
- These pantomimes suck.
- Don't look at me. I didn't hire them.

879
01:00:56,759 --> 01:00:59,489
- Well, who did?
- I don't know.

880
01:01:02,499 --> 01:01:05,400
These pantomimes aren't very good.

881
01:01:05,869 --> 01:01:08,360
This must be Reese's big surprise.

882
01:01:08,538 --> 01:01:10,699
Look at me, guys,
I'm a mime too.

883
01:01:10,874 --> 01:01:13,503
- Everyone's miming something.
- Embarrassing.

884
01:01:23,087 --> 01:01:24,520
- Reese just left.
- I know.

885
01:01:24,688 --> 01:01:27,088
- Stay here, I'll follow him.
- I'll follow him.

886
01:01:27,258 --> 01:01:31,354
No, you stay. Keep them occupied.
You're doing great. They love you.

887
01:01:41,939 --> 01:01:45,397
I might do the glass wall
one more time.

888
01:01:46,777 --> 01:01:48,404
Boo!

889
01:01:48,579 --> 01:01:53,380
Terrific. Tell him you like him, ask him to
sit by you at the cafeteria. How do I know?

890
01:01:53,551 --> 01:01:58,215
What am I, your counselor? Yeah, I'd like
to get to the information that I need, okay?

891
01:01:59,823 --> 01:02:01,120
<i>It's done.</i>

892
01:02:01,458 --> 01:02:07,158
My buddy delivered the package. It's in
your garage. It's locked up nice and tight...

893
01:02:07,331 --> 01:02:10,095
<i>- ... in case anybody gets nosy.
- No one saw him?</i>

894
01:02:10,267 --> 01:02:11,427
<i>Not a soul.</i>

895
01:02:11,602 --> 01:02:13,298
Now, about my fee...

896
01:02:13,471 --> 01:02:17,202
You'll be paid as soon as I've
checked it out. If you'll excuse me...

897
01:02:17,375 --> 01:02:19,775
- Reese, wait.
- What?

898
01:02:20,645 --> 01:02:23,205
<i>- Mazel tov, man.
- Thanks.</i>

899
01:02:23,381 --> 01:02:24,643
They grow up so fast.

900
01:02:25,016 --> 01:02:29,077
<i>- Go play dragon. I gotta go.
- All right. Big kisses.</i>

901
01:02:30,855 --> 01:02:35,588
Thank you, everybody, for coming out to
celebrate my little girl's bat mitzvah.

902
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:39,491
I should say "young woman."
It'll take me a while to get used to that.

903
01:02:39,664 --> 01:02:42,064
- This guy's good. Sweet.
- It's in his garage.

904
01:02:42,234 --> 01:02:44,134
- What?
- The cocaine is in his garage.

905
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:46,395
- Are you sure?
- We take him down now.

906
01:02:46,571 --> 01:02:49,369
- Let's go.
- All right, cut the music.

907
01:02:49,541 --> 01:02:51,133
Cut the music.

908
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:54,767
I think I speak for everyone
when I say we're a little mimed out.

909
01:02:54,946 --> 01:02:56,277
Don't worry. Show's over.

910
01:02:56,781 --> 01:02:59,716
You're under arrest for possession
with intent to sell.

911
01:02:59,884 --> 01:03:02,819
- This man's a drug dealer.
- Okay, I think what we have...

912
01:03:02,988 --> 01:03:05,786
- Maybe you didn't hear us.
- Take it easy, everybody.

913
01:03:05,957 --> 01:03:08,892
You're making the biggest mistake
of your life, hear me?

914
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:11,221
You're the one making
the mistake, pusher.

915
01:03:12,832 --> 01:03:16,097
Kevin, call my attorney,
please. Ridiculous.

916
01:03:16,502 --> 01:03:18,902
- Open it.
- My hands are tied.

917
01:03:19,071 --> 01:03:21,869
Fine. Allow me.

918
01:03:23,009 --> 01:03:25,876
Let this be a lesson to everyone,
especially you kids.

919
01:03:26,045 --> 01:03:29,105
Don't be fooled by the first-class suit
and the big house.

920
01:03:29,282 --> 01:03:32,547
Reese Feldman's nothing more than
a two-bit drug dealer.

921
01:03:32,718 --> 01:03:34,618
You want some proof?

922
01:03:35,221 --> 01:03:37,155
Here's some proof.

923
01:03:40,493 --> 01:03:42,085
This is a bad man.

924
01:03:42,828 --> 01:03:45,524
And this is what bad men do.

925
01:03:46,499 --> 01:03:48,660
A pony!

926
01:03:49,001 --> 01:03:51,265
Happy bat mitzvah, baby. I love you.

927
01:03:55,308 --> 01:03:57,572
Take the kids in, come on.
Let's go, kids.

928
01:03:57,743 --> 01:04:01,941
It's all right, baby, it's okay. Come here.
Come here. We'll get you a new pony.

929
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:07,447
Hey there, little fella. You okay?

930
01:04:11,357 --> 01:04:17,058
Mr. Feldman, on behalf of the
entire Bay City Police Department...

931
01:04:17,731 --> 01:04:21,827
...I sincerely apologize.
- That's okay, captain.

932
01:04:22,002 --> 01:04:25,438
My attorney here would love to
take them down, but I know...

933
01:04:25,605 --> 01:04:27,402
...that in the bottom
of their hearts...

934
01:04:27,574 --> 01:04:32,375
...these two detectives were just
trying to protect me and my family.

935
01:04:32,979 --> 01:04:35,971
I gotcha. Thank you.

936
01:04:37,884 --> 01:04:41,547
I respect your attitude,
but you can be sure...

937
01:04:41,722 --> 01:04:44,452
...it will never happen again,
because as of now...

938
01:04:44,791 --> 01:04:47,453
...both of you are suspended indefinitely.

939
01:04:47,627 --> 01:04:52,394
Look, cap, this was my fault.
Don't drag Hutch into this. I shot the pony.

940
01:04:52,566 --> 01:04:54,227
You care what happens to Hutch?

941
01:04:54,401 --> 01:04:58,132
You filed for transfer two weeks ago,
citing his behavior as a reason.

942
01:04:58,305 --> 01:05:01,240
- Captain...
- Oh yeah, yeah. Check this out.

943
01:05:01,408 --> 01:05:04,002
Sounds like you're quite
the crime fighter, Hutch.

944
01:05:04,177 --> 01:05:07,738
- You filed for a transfer?
- Guns and badges, right here, on my desk.

945
01:05:11,651 --> 01:05:14,177
Your mother would be
very disappointed in you.

946
01:05:30,338 --> 01:05:33,967
Man, I've really had it with that Doby.
I mean, it's enough already.

947
01:05:34,142 --> 01:05:39,102
"Cavorting with nefarious characters.
Conduct unbecoming of an officer."

948
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:42,813
I wrote that two weeks ago.
Things are really cool with us now.

949
01:05:42,984 --> 01:05:45,418
- Hey, did you go through my locker?
- No.

950
01:05:45,586 --> 01:05:48,783
- You went through my locker.
- I might have looked inside...

951
01:05:48,956 --> 01:05:53,484
If you got a problem with someone, tell it
to their face. You come to them as a man.

952
01:05:53,661 --> 01:05:58,394
You don't go behind their back and write
a thesis and try to get transferred.

953
01:06:04,972 --> 01:06:07,202
Backstabber!

954
01:06:07,442 --> 01:06:10,138
Yeah, don't anybody work
with David Starsky.

955
01:06:10,311 --> 01:06:12,974
He'll stab you in the back.

956
01:06:14,383 --> 01:06:17,784
You've got to let this go.
We got lucky. These guys screwed up.

957
01:06:17,953 --> 01:06:21,150
- They can't even touch us now. It is over.
- I don't care.

958
01:06:21,323 --> 01:06:25,259
No one dresses as a mime and embarrasses
me at my daughter's bat mitzvah.

959
01:06:25,594 --> 01:06:27,027
In my own house, no less.

960
01:06:27,196 --> 01:06:29,528
Have some perspective.
We're almost finished.

961
01:06:29,698 --> 01:06:33,634
We're a few days from closing
a $35-million deal. Let it slide.

962
01:06:33,802 --> 01:06:36,930
Yeah, I'll let it slide. When they're dead.

963
01:06:38,307 --> 01:06:39,672
Why did I get so lucky?

964
01:06:39,842 --> 01:06:42,902
I don't know, I just love
when you talk so tough.

965
01:06:43,078 --> 01:06:46,343
Of course you do. That's why
you're my girlfriend on the side.

966
01:07:17,914 --> 01:07:19,575
Hey, Hutch.

967
01:08:02,458 --> 01:08:04,619
"Ruin me!"

968
01:08:09,666 --> 01:08:12,158
Excuse me, let me have
a minute with my friend.

969
01:08:12,336 --> 01:08:17,296
He didn't care if he got ruined. That was
the whole point of the episode. Did you...?

970
01:08:17,474 --> 01:08:21,535
Hutch, you gonna have to lay up off
of this juice. You had too much to drink.

971
01:08:21,712 --> 01:08:27,116
Come on. I feel like a million bucks.
Just laughing, having a good time.

972
01:08:27,284 --> 01:08:28,876
It ain't even funny no more.

973
01:08:29,053 --> 01:08:33,490
There used to be a time here when you
peed against the wall, you did it outside.

974
01:08:36,493 --> 01:08:39,985
Lighten up, it's Friday night.
Okay? It's a bar.

975
01:08:40,164 --> 01:08:43,258
Hutch, it's Wednesday afternoon, man.
Snap out of it.

976
01:08:45,369 --> 01:08:48,736
- What time is it?
- It's 5:00, man.

977
01:08:48,906 --> 01:08:54,208
Shit. I'm supposed to pick up Willis at 3.
Huggy, I'm sorry, we...

978
01:08:56,547 --> 01:09:00,313
Hutch! Hey, Hutch! You home?

979
01:09:00,484 --> 01:09:04,545
You were supposed to pick me up
at 3:00 today. What happened?

980
01:09:05,556 --> 01:09:06,853
Deadbeat.

981
01:09:27,879 --> 01:09:32,145
<i>If you could have yourself one wish,
what would it be for?</i>

982
01:09:32,317 --> 01:09:35,616
"Mama put the salt back on a
straight line with the pepper...

983
01:09:35,787 --> 01:09:39,416
...and got that look like when
she be telling me that old wise stuff.

984
01:09:39,591 --> 01:09:41,559
She told Nobie he
should wish for..."

985
01:09:41,993 --> 01:09:46,953
<i>Good friends. Free to Be You and Me.
That's what Mama tells Nobie to wish for.</i>

986
01:09:47,265 --> 01:09:49,426
- Well, well, well.
- How you doing, Willis?

987
01:09:49,601 --> 01:09:53,401
- I'm pretty good.
- Yeah? Got you something.

988
01:09:53,571 --> 01:09:57,200
Damn. A wrist rocket.

989
01:09:57,375 --> 01:10:02,369
- Watch out with that thing. Very powerful.
- Cool. Thanks, Starsky.

990
01:10:02,547 --> 01:10:05,812
Pretty sure those are illegal.
Even though you're my friend...

991
01:10:05,984 --> 01:10:08,077
...might have to report you to Doby.

992
01:10:10,389 --> 01:10:13,790
All right. Okay, look, Hutch, can we...?

993
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:16,755
Is it all right if I talk
to you outside?

994
01:10:16,929 --> 01:10:19,591
No, I better stay here with the kid.

995
01:10:19,999 --> 01:10:22,968
All right. Hey, feel better, all right?

996
01:10:23,135 --> 01:10:24,727
You got it.

997
01:10:25,938 --> 01:10:30,466
- Can you believe that guy? What a...
- Hutch, the man was trying to apologize.

998
01:10:31,010 --> 01:10:33,535
Dig this, man. Someone once said...

999
01:10:33,713 --> 01:10:37,581
..."To err is human, to forgive, divine."

1000
01:10:39,752 --> 01:10:41,083
What idiot said that?

1001
01:10:41,253 --> 01:10:45,189
I believe that was God,
the greatest mack of all.

1002
01:10:47,393 --> 01:10:50,260
David. David.

1003
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:52,229
Yeah.

1004
01:10:53,999 --> 01:10:55,728
Okay, so, what did you wanna say?

1005
01:10:55,901 --> 01:10:59,564
Nothing. Apparently you're too busy
and I'm not worth it. It's fine.

1006
01:10:59,739 --> 01:11:02,207
- Really, it's good.
- Come on, let's hear it.

1007
01:11:02,641 --> 01:11:07,476
There's nothing that... I just was gonna
say that I think you're a good cop.

1008
01:11:07,646 --> 01:11:11,913
- Okay, well, thank you.
- And I am...

1009
01:11:12,085 --> 01:11:16,283
...sorry about what I wrote in the report.

1010
01:11:16,456 --> 01:11:20,358
Yeah, because I'm telling you, I felt like
I'd just gotten my world rocked...

1011
01:11:21,394 --> 01:11:23,191
- Are you crying?
- What's that?

1012
01:11:23,363 --> 01:11:26,821
- Are you crying?
- No, I'm not crying. You're crying.

1013
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,195
It's okay to cry. People cry.

1014
01:11:29,369 --> 01:11:34,966
That's great, but I'm not crying. I'm not a
crier. I don't cry. I work out. I have hobbies.

1015
01:11:35,142 --> 01:11:36,404
- Come here.
- What?

1016
01:11:36,777 --> 01:11:40,076
- Come here. I forgive you, all right?
- Okay.

1017
01:11:40,247 --> 01:11:41,714
I forgive you.

1018
01:11:42,182 --> 01:11:45,674
Okay, that's probably enough.
That's enough.

1019
01:11:45,852 --> 01:11:47,376
- All right?
- Okay.

1020
01:11:47,554 --> 01:11:49,419
- Are we good?
- Yeah, we're good.

1021
01:11:49,589 --> 01:11:52,149
Because we got some people
that want us dead.

1022
01:11:52,325 --> 01:11:56,785
They took a shot at you. They tried to
blow up my house, almost killed little Willis.

1023
01:11:56,963 --> 01:11:59,329
We gotta do... Now what?

1024
01:11:59,499 --> 01:12:02,434
Nothing. I'm just excited.
Let's get these scumbags!

1025
01:12:02,602 --> 01:12:05,503
- Get them! That's what I wanna see.
- Let's get them!

1026
01:12:05,672 --> 01:12:08,573
- Get some tissues. Let's go.
- What are you doing?

1027
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:09,833
- Damn. I'll tell you that.
- Look, I'm telling you, it's right here.

1028
01:13:10,005 --> 01:13:14,601
Reese is meeting with the biggest drug
dealers in back alleys all over the place.

1029
01:13:14,776 --> 01:13:16,971
But talking isn't illegal.

1030
01:13:17,145 --> 01:13:21,104
Yeah, the guy's not stupid.
He knows how to stay clean.

1031
01:13:21,283 --> 01:13:23,046
Dirty ones always do.

1032
01:13:23,218 --> 01:13:27,746
We gotta find a way to get close to him,
get inside and hear what's going on.

1033
01:13:27,923 --> 01:13:30,687
It's gonna be tough.
The guy knows what we look like.

1034
01:13:30,859 --> 01:13:33,157
He doesn't know what
Huggy Bear looks like.

1035
01:13:35,664 --> 01:13:40,465
Man, this is a bunch of crap.
I am an urban informant. I am not a snitch.

1036
01:13:40,636 --> 01:13:44,367
- Come on, Huggy, what's the difference?
- A snitch wears a wire.

1037
01:13:44,539 --> 01:13:47,406
A snitch is the scum
of the information industry.

1038
01:13:47,576 --> 01:13:50,977
A snitch has no soul.
Damn, man, that shit hurt.

1039
01:13:51,146 --> 01:13:53,444
- I'm sorry.
- You got to be more careful.

1040
01:13:53,615 --> 01:13:57,051
We wouldn't ask you to do this
unless it was really important.

1041
01:13:57,219 --> 01:13:59,551
- I'm gonna owe you one.
- More than one, man.

1042
01:13:59,721 --> 01:14:02,849
Let's slow down with the scorekeeping.
I might remember...

1043
01:14:03,025 --> 01:14:07,018
...stuff I've overlooked over the years,
then mention it to my partner here.

1044
01:14:08,630 --> 01:14:10,326
How'd that be?

1045
01:14:12,168 --> 01:14:16,730
- All right, man, get this over with. Hurry up.
- All right. All right. Good. We're done.

1046
01:14:16,906 --> 01:14:19,704
- All right, let's get that outfit.
- Outfit?

1047
01:14:21,477 --> 01:14:24,844
Oh, no, man. You know Huggy Bear
wouldn't wear that, man.

1048
01:14:25,014 --> 01:14:28,279
Come with something better.
Take that shit back to Florida.

1049
01:14:28,451 --> 01:14:29,918
That ain't me, baby.

1050
01:14:35,825 --> 01:14:38,350
Mr. Casual. So nice of you to join us.

1051
01:14:38,795 --> 01:14:40,956
Sorry about that, sir.

1052
01:14:41,597 --> 01:14:43,497
What would you say this is?

1053
01:14:45,168 --> 01:14:46,658
Golf?

1054
01:14:47,303 --> 01:14:50,101
Real funny, Amos.
Give me the 9-iron.

1055
01:14:56,746 --> 01:14:59,579
- Where the hell's my 9-iron?
- I was gonna bring...

1056
01:14:59,749 --> 01:15:01,717
Let me explain something to you.

1057
01:15:01,884 --> 01:15:04,717
You are in charge
of this area right here.

1058
01:15:05,288 --> 01:15:07,279
Clubs come out.
They gotta go back in.

1059
01:15:07,457 --> 01:15:12,020
I realize this is a complex procedure, but it's
up to you to manage the whole business.

1060
01:15:12,196 --> 01:15:13,458
Do you got that, Nipsey?

1061
01:15:14,264 --> 01:15:15,891
<i>- Yes.
- I should make you run...</i>

1062
01:15:16,066 --> 01:15:20,264
<i>... back to the driving range and get it.
Just give me the wedge.</i>

1063
01:15:25,009 --> 01:15:27,637
3-wood?
My man gave me a 3-wood.

1064
01:15:28,579 --> 01:15:30,809
<i>Do you even know what
a pitching wedge is?</i>

1065
01:15:31,015 --> 01:15:33,074
<i>- Are you even a real caddy?
- Come on.</i>

1066
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:38,916
Look, man, this grass is
Alabama Creeping Bent...

1067
01:15:39,189 --> 01:15:41,419
<i>... as opposed to Georgia Creeping Bent.</i>

1068
01:15:42,426 --> 01:15:44,121
It's lighter.

1069
01:15:44,595 --> 01:15:47,496
- Lighter meaning faster?
- Exactly.

1070
01:15:51,535 --> 01:15:53,162
Hold this.

1071
01:15:58,442 --> 01:16:00,342
Look at that. Good shot.

1072
01:16:06,050 --> 01:16:09,680
- You know a lot about golf.
- I know even more about grass.

1073
01:16:09,854 --> 01:16:11,617
I don't question that.

1074
01:16:11,790 --> 01:16:15,282
<i>- That was a great shot. Don't even start.
- Fine. Back to business.</i>

1075
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:18,657
The stuff is all ready to be moved.
All two tons of it.

1076
01:16:18,830 --> 01:16:22,288
We're gold. We need to be at
the banquet by 2 p.m. Anything else?

1077
01:16:22,467 --> 01:16:24,162
Yeah, just stay calm and...

1078
01:16:24,335 --> 01:16:27,498
What, are we dating?
Why are you standing so close to me?

1079
01:16:27,672 --> 01:16:30,505
- Back off.
- It's cool, baby.

1080
01:16:31,609 --> 01:16:33,338
What is your deal?

1081
01:16:36,581 --> 01:16:39,277
The Nearly There banquet.
Remember? It's tomorrow.

1082
01:16:39,451 --> 01:16:43,717
- How's he gonna move coke at a banquet?
- I don't know, but we gotta be there.

1083
01:16:43,888 --> 01:16:46,686
No, can't. He'll kill us if he sees us.

1084
01:16:49,194 --> 01:16:51,856
You wanna use my wig guy.

1085
01:17:40,980 --> 01:17:44,711
Hello, sir. May I check your briefcase?

1086
01:17:46,752 --> 01:17:49,585
Oh, yeah. Thanks a lot.

1087
01:17:56,729 --> 01:17:58,720
Thank you very much.

1088
01:17:59,131 --> 01:18:04,034
Now, what you wanna do is take
this ticket stub. It's for the raffle.

1089
01:18:04,203 --> 01:18:07,070
And see that car up on stage?

1090
01:18:07,740 --> 01:18:13,441
There's seven of them, all up for grabs,
with plenty of trunk space.

1091
01:18:17,083 --> 01:18:23,215
Trunk space. I get it. Very good.
Very good. Thank you very much.

1092
01:18:35,202 --> 01:18:39,434
- That's what I'm talking about. Right here.
- There we go.

1093
01:18:39,606 --> 01:18:42,769
- What do you think?
- I love it. Great stuff.

1094
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:46,504
Yeah, you look just like a rich cowboy,
came riding in off the farm.

1095
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:50,172
- Do me a favor. Tip your hat forward.
- No, I like it where it is.

1096
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:54,446
- No, seriously, come on, do it. Do it.
- Will you stop with that?

1097
01:18:54,621 --> 01:18:56,714
That voice makes you sound crazy.

1098
01:18:56,890 --> 01:18:58,983
It makes me sound like Maury Finkel...

1099
01:18:59,159 --> 01:19:02,151
...founder of Finkel Fixtures,
a lighting fixture chain.

1100
01:19:02,329 --> 01:19:06,629
Oh, it's a little voice and a character.
You got a whole back-story. That's good.

1101
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,531
Little touches. You wanna
make the character real.

1102
01:19:09,704 --> 01:19:12,434
- What's your character?
- I don't really...

1103
01:19:12,607 --> 01:19:15,167
I don't have a character.
I don't do voices.

1104
01:19:15,743 --> 01:19:20,043
We're going upstairs. People will
recognize us if we don't have a character.

1105
01:19:20,214 --> 01:19:21,943
- Think of something.
- Okay.

1106
01:19:22,116 --> 01:19:23,378
Buck up, let's do it.

1107
01:19:25,553 --> 01:19:27,612
How are you? How's it going?

1108
01:19:27,788 --> 01:19:31,554
All right. How you doing? All right.

1109
01:19:31,726 --> 01:19:35,992
Look at these two hot chickens.
Finkel wants some dinkle. Give it to me.

1110
01:19:36,163 --> 01:19:40,691
Come on. Do it.
Lay it on, right here. Do it. Do it.

1111
01:19:40,868 --> 01:19:43,735
He means a kiss. We're doing
little voices. Undercover.

1112
01:19:43,904 --> 01:19:45,166
Come on, sweetie. Do it.

1113
01:19:45,906 --> 01:19:49,569
- That's a sweet little pucker. I love it.
- Can I get you two a drink?

1114
01:19:49,744 --> 01:19:52,178
You sure can, sweetheart.
Johnnie Red, neat.

1115
01:19:52,346 --> 01:19:54,075
- Okay.
- Do it. Do it.

1116
01:19:55,082 --> 01:19:56,879
All right. And you?

1117
01:19:59,854 --> 01:20:05,656
- Do it. Bacardi and cola. Do it, do it.
- Okay. I'll be right back.

1118
01:20:05,826 --> 01:20:07,293
- What are you doing?
- What?

1119
01:20:07,462 --> 01:20:10,454
- What was that? You just stole my voice.
- No, I didn't.

1120
01:20:10,632 --> 01:20:13,658
You gotta come up with your own voice.
That's my thing.

1121
01:20:13,835 --> 01:20:17,134
- I don't have a cool voice like you.
- Come up with a character.

1122
01:20:17,306 --> 01:20:21,037
You're a Texas oil tycoon guy.
You have, like, a moustache...

1123
01:20:21,209 --> 01:20:23,109
Don't shame me.

1124
01:20:23,278 --> 01:20:24,711
Let's sit down. Come on.

1125
01:20:25,047 --> 01:20:30,349
So we can get down to business and then
get back to the business of getting down.

1126
01:20:30,519 --> 01:20:34,080
Now, that's what I'm talking about.
Let's get down!

1127
01:20:35,757 --> 01:20:37,748
Captain Doby, you're not right.

1128
01:20:39,761 --> 01:20:43,356
But today is right.
Can I see a show of hands?

1129
01:20:43,532 --> 01:20:46,433
I'm talking to everyone in this room.

1130
01:20:46,601 --> 01:20:48,569
How many of us have made a mistake?

1131
01:20:48,737 --> 01:20:50,102
- Guilty.
- Yeah.

1132
01:20:50,872 --> 01:20:54,603
You know, I believe it was our buddy
Bill Shakespeare who said...

1133
01:20:54,776 --> 01:21:00,737
..."To err is human, but to forgive,
well, that's right on."

1134
01:21:00,916 --> 01:21:02,884
That's exactly why
we're here today.

1135
01:21:03,051 --> 01:21:06,782
Because everyone out there
deserves a second chance. Everyone.

1136
01:21:08,658 --> 01:21:12,685
Thank you. I didn't say it.
Bill Shakespeare did.

1137
01:21:13,262 --> 01:21:15,526
Some of these guys were
in our surveillance.

1138
01:21:15,698 --> 01:21:18,462
- I know.
- Check out the guy behind us.

1139
01:21:18,634 --> 01:21:20,363
Already did.

1140
01:21:20,737 --> 01:21:23,228
You think he's got the stuff here?

1141
01:21:24,507 --> 01:21:27,806
- Where?
- I'd like to thank Bay City Volkswagen...

1142
01:21:27,977 --> 01:21:33,574
...for donating seven brand-new cars
to our annual fundraising raffle.

1143
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:35,650
Thank you, Bay City Volkswagen.

1144
01:21:35,818 --> 01:21:39,549
Okay, everybody. Go ahead,
pull out your ticket stubs.

1145
01:21:39,722 --> 01:21:43,852
Hope you held onto it. Hate to have your
number called and have it left behind.

1146
01:21:44,026 --> 01:21:46,859
Because this train's
leaving the station.

1147
01:21:55,037 --> 01:21:58,131
Tonight's first winner. 63.

1148
01:21:58,307 --> 01:22:01,174
- Hot damn, that baby's mine!
- Congratulations.

1149
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:02,709
That's one of his guys.

1150
01:22:03,045 --> 01:22:05,013
- Thank you very much.
- Just wait here.

1151
01:22:05,181 --> 01:22:08,276
We've got a winner, a new car owner.
Let him hear it.

1152
01:22:08,452 --> 01:22:10,249
He's gonna ride home in class.

1153
01:22:10,421 --> 01:22:13,982
The car. Cocaine is in the car.
He's doing it in front of everybody.

1154
01:22:14,158 --> 01:22:17,685
- He's not that stupid.
- No, but he's that arrogant. Trust me.

1155
01:22:17,861 --> 01:22:20,125
Number 117.

1156
01:22:20,597 --> 01:22:22,394
- Go.
- Right on! Yeah.

1157
01:22:23,534 --> 01:22:24,796
Yes!

1158
01:22:26,403 --> 01:22:30,965
- Thank you very much.
- Sit. Now. Do it. Do it.

1159
01:22:31,141 --> 01:22:35,544
Old Shakes McGinty did it!
Yes! Unbelievable!

1160
01:22:35,712 --> 01:22:38,408
I'm a-richer, and I'm gonna kiss you.

1161
01:22:39,116 --> 01:22:41,243
Get your hands off. I think...
I don't...

1162
01:22:41,418 --> 01:22:44,148
My friend won. Give him the car. Do it.

1163
01:22:44,455 --> 01:22:46,480
- Do what?
- The kid's from Texas.

1164
01:22:46,657 --> 01:22:49,319
I don't know if he has a license.
He rides a horse.

1165
01:22:49,493 --> 01:22:52,394
Do you have a ticket?
I need it to give you the car.

1166
01:22:52,563 --> 01:22:55,123
- You gotta trust the kid.
- I can't, cowboy.

1167
01:22:55,299 --> 01:22:56,994
I need to see the ticket.

1168
01:22:57,167 --> 01:22:59,727
Pop the trunk.
Let's get that new car smell.

1169
01:22:59,903 --> 01:23:02,929
- Who wants a whiff of that new car smell?
- Let's smell it!

1170
01:23:03,106 --> 01:23:09,410
That's what I'm talking about. Come on.
Pop the trunk. Seriously, do it. Do it.

1171
01:23:10,448 --> 01:23:13,315
- Do it.
- Listen, jackass.

1172
01:23:13,485 --> 01:23:17,387
Either give me a ticket or get the
hell off the stage. You dig that?

1173
01:23:17,555 --> 01:23:20,422
- Guys.
- Pop the trunk, candy man.

1174
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:24,157
You heard him.

1175
01:23:24,762 --> 01:23:26,024
Pop it.

1176
01:23:26,197 --> 01:23:28,188
What the hell are you two doing?

1177
01:23:28,366 --> 01:23:30,163
Pop it!

1178
01:23:30,335 --> 01:23:33,065
You screwed it up once already, Starsky.

1179
01:23:35,940 --> 01:23:39,273
Like you said, Feldman,
everyone deserves a second chance.

1180
01:23:41,646 --> 01:23:44,615
What have we here?

1181
01:23:44,782 --> 01:23:47,876
Does this look familiar? Some cocaine.

1182
01:23:48,052 --> 01:23:51,920
Captain Doby, I suggest you take
this to the lab, get it analyzed...

1183
01:23:52,090 --> 01:23:54,524
- Hutch!
- All right, freeze! Everybody, freeze!

1184
01:23:54,692 --> 01:23:58,594
- Put your hands where I can see them!
- Relax, pal. Relax!

1185
01:23:58,763 --> 01:24:01,960
- Let's do it!
- Put that gun down or I'll kill your friend.

1186
01:24:02,133 --> 01:24:05,125
- Reese, what are we doing?
- Do it now! Put it down!

1187
01:24:05,303 --> 01:24:07,295
I got a clean shot.
I need permission.

1188
01:24:07,473 --> 01:24:09,634
No! No, Starsky.

1189
01:24:09,808 --> 01:24:12,140
I can do it. Just move
your head to the left.

1190
01:24:12,311 --> 01:24:17,146
No can do. You don't have my permission,
partner. I can't give it to you.

1191
01:24:17,316 --> 01:24:21,446
- Your nuts are mine, Feldman.
- No, they're not! Your nuts are yours.

1192
01:24:21,620 --> 01:24:25,920
Starsky, listen to me. I don't wanna die.
And I'm not giving you my permission.

1193
01:24:26,492 --> 01:24:28,619
Please, put it down.

1194
01:24:30,029 --> 01:24:32,725
Put it down. Down.

1195
01:24:35,801 --> 01:24:38,269
Okay. All right. You're right.
It's too close.

1196
01:24:38,437 --> 01:24:40,428
Oh, thank God.

1197
01:24:44,243 --> 01:24:45,676
Stay down!

1198
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:49,879
Doby?

1199
01:24:51,283 --> 01:24:53,774
- Come on, let's move it! Let's go!
- What?

1200
01:24:54,954 --> 01:24:56,581
Walk away. Walk away. Let's go.

1201
01:24:56,755 --> 01:24:59,553
- Cap, are you okay?
- Yeah, I just got my wing clipped.

1202
01:24:59,725 --> 01:25:02,660
- Who the hell shot me?
- I'm sorry. I was trying to get...

1203
01:25:02,828 --> 01:25:06,663
Starsky! It was Reese Feldman.
Reese Feldman hit you, the son of a bitch.

1204
01:25:06,833 --> 01:25:08,858
Well, go get him!

1205
01:25:09,035 --> 01:25:12,232
- Is somebody coming?
- No, we're on vacation.

1206
01:25:12,539 --> 01:25:14,006
- What's going on?
- Gotta go.

1207
01:25:15,575 --> 01:25:17,600
Oh, my God!

1208
01:25:18,345 --> 01:25:21,644
- Baby, look out!
- Look, I wanna hit him!

1209
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:24,784
- You okay?
- Yeah!

1210
01:25:38,665 --> 01:25:41,691
- Watch out for the bunker!
- I don't know what a bunker is!

1211
01:25:41,868 --> 01:25:43,699
It's a sand trap.

1212
01:25:46,906 --> 01:25:49,534
- Go faster!
- I'm going fast. I got it floored.

1213
01:25:53,213 --> 01:25:55,875
- Dogleg right up here on the par three.
- What?

1214
01:25:56,049 --> 01:25:57,949
- Watch the bunker!
- What bunker?

1215
01:25:58,118 --> 01:25:59,585
Jesus!

1216
01:26:01,788 --> 01:26:03,619
Come on. Pay attention.

1217
01:26:05,893 --> 01:26:08,384
Hey! Get out of here!

1218
01:26:14,635 --> 01:26:17,627
- Move that ice cream truck now!
- No, you move.

1219
01:26:17,805 --> 01:26:20,569
- Bay City P.D. Move it!
- Let's go.

1220
01:26:20,741 --> 01:26:23,938
Grab those and meet me
in the marina. Let's go. Move!

1221
01:26:24,111 --> 01:26:26,602
If you guys are cops,
let's see some badge.

1222
01:26:27,815 --> 01:26:30,978
- We don't have any badges.
- Show him your gun.

1223
01:26:32,753 --> 01:26:34,118
Come on! Come on, move!

1224
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:49,927
- Come on, hurry up, let's go!
- They're coming!

1225
01:26:50,104 --> 01:26:54,234
Come on, these two with the running
and the chasing. Stop! Go home.

1226
01:26:55,443 --> 01:26:56,933
Goodbye, heroes!

1227
01:26:57,111 --> 01:26:58,942
- To the shipping yard!
- Got a boat?

1228
01:26:59,113 --> 01:27:01,274
- No, but I got an idea.

1229
01:27:17,432 --> 01:27:18,763
Hey, watch out!

1230
01:27:23,872 --> 01:27:26,807
- Okay, now what?
- Okay, we're gonna take this car...

1231
01:27:26,975 --> 01:27:29,273
...and land it on that boat.

1232
01:27:32,214 --> 01:27:36,548
- You wanna crash the car into his boat?
- No, I wanna land it on that boat.

1233
01:27:36,718 --> 01:27:38,686
Now, go.

1234
01:27:40,756 --> 01:27:42,815
- Go!
- I can't do it.

1235
01:27:42,991 --> 01:27:46,392
This is unbelievable. Here you get
me out here to risk my life...

1236
01:27:46,561 --> 01:27:49,860
...and now you tell me you
can't do this? I'm a quitter, but...

1237
01:27:51,466 --> 01:27:55,732
- You're crying again.
- I'm not crying. This is different.

1238
01:27:56,738 --> 01:28:02,608
It's my mother. She always used to say that
this was too much car for me to handle.

1239
01:28:02,778 --> 01:28:06,146
- She said that?
- Couldn't handle the V8.

1240
01:28:07,016 --> 01:28:12,579
- I don't know, maybe she was right.
- Hey, look at me. Look at me.

1241
01:28:12,922 --> 01:28:16,653
I am not your mother.
I'm your partner.

1242
01:28:17,860 --> 01:28:19,691
Now, go!

1243
01:28:21,230 --> 01:28:22,891
Go!

1244
01:28:26,502 --> 01:28:30,199
- Things could go pretty wrong, so I...
- Keep your eyes on the road.

1245
01:28:30,373 --> 01:28:35,675
Listen to me, Ken. If we don't make it,
this... You know, us...

1246
01:28:36,913 --> 01:28:39,609
- It's been good.
- It's been great.

1247
01:28:39,782 --> 01:28:42,580
Now, will you stop talking
and hit that boat.

1248
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:45,778
It's not a boat, it's a yacht.

1249
01:28:55,364 --> 01:28:57,491
Son of a bitch!

1250
01:28:59,202 --> 01:29:03,969
- Come on, are you kidding me?
- Oh, my God. We almost just got killed.

1251
01:29:04,140 --> 01:29:08,237
Thanks for pointing out something
I couldn't notice. You're a benefit to have.

1252
01:29:08,412 --> 01:29:10,778
We should save them.

1253
01:29:15,752 --> 01:29:18,448
- Son of a bitch!
- Nice plan!

1254
01:29:18,622 --> 01:29:21,523
You gave it too much gas
and you overshot it.

1255
01:29:21,692 --> 01:29:26,595
- Car has a lot of horsepower. I'll go get it.
- What are you doing? Stop it.

1256
01:29:28,799 --> 01:29:30,699
Starsky!

1257
01:29:31,902 --> 01:29:36,601
- It hasn't hit the bottom yet.
- Stop, stop, damn it! Listen to me.

1258
01:29:36,773 --> 01:29:40,209
It's gone, okay? It's over.

1259
01:29:40,577 --> 01:29:44,536
- But it's my car.
- I know it is, partner. I know it is.

1260
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:53,055
Oh, my God, honey.
That was so incredible.

1261
01:29:53,223 --> 01:29:55,589
I feel like my adrenaline is just...

1262
01:29:55,759 --> 01:29:59,024
You and me, babe. We are such
a good team, don't you think?

1263
01:29:59,196 --> 01:30:05,067
I mean, this is just the beginning. We could
go so far, honey. I feel so exhilarated.

1264
01:30:05,236 --> 01:30:06,828
- Come on!
- What was that?

1265
01:30:07,005 --> 01:30:09,303
Son of a bitch.

1266
01:30:10,875 --> 01:30:12,672
What is it, Reese?

1267
01:30:18,716 --> 01:30:20,308
Who are you?

1268
01:30:21,119 --> 01:30:22,848
I found your 9-iron, bitch.

1269
01:30:26,224 --> 01:30:31,685
That's for putting hands on Huggy Bear.
Nobody touches the Bear, you dig?

1270
01:30:34,432 --> 01:30:38,027
Yeah. Now, these will work.

1271
01:30:38,436 --> 01:30:41,166
What have we here?

1272
01:30:44,409 --> 01:30:47,207
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

1273
01:30:57,555 --> 01:31:01,787
- We don't really do private shows.
- But I'm a good friend of Huggy Bear.

1274
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:07,126
- It's kind of against cheerleading policy.
- You need to change that policy.

1275
01:31:07,299 --> 01:31:09,324
You know what I can't figure out?

1276
01:31:09,501 --> 01:31:11,901
How the hell did you know
to get on that boat?

1277
01:31:12,071 --> 01:31:15,632
When your two boys put me on
that undercover golf course mission...

1278
01:31:15,808 --> 01:31:20,040
...that cat, Reese? All he did
was talk about that damn yacht.

1279
01:31:20,212 --> 01:31:25,172
And like I say, why go to the starting line
when you can go straight to the finish?

1280
01:31:25,351 --> 01:31:28,787
"Straight to the finish."
I like that, man. I like that.

1281
01:31:28,954 --> 01:31:31,752
Are you interested in doing
any undercover work?

1282
01:31:31,924 --> 01:31:34,916
- Not the least.
- Captain, let me borrow him for a second.

1283
01:31:35,094 --> 01:31:40,532
The weird thing is, one of those briefcases
with $5 million just up and vanished.

1284
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:44,260
Oh, what is this, a brand-new fur coat?
Look at this thing.

1285
01:31:44,436 --> 01:31:47,337
Yeah, I inherited some money
from a dead uncle of mine.

1286
01:31:47,506 --> 01:31:50,270
Is that right? I didn't even
know you had an uncle.

1287
01:31:50,442 --> 01:31:54,708
Well, I did.
And he was rich as hell too, baby.

1288
01:31:55,848 --> 01:31:59,750
- Chin up, little man.
- I think he's still upset about the car.

1289
01:31:59,918 --> 01:32:02,250
Come on, let's get up.
You're going outside.

1290
01:32:02,421 --> 01:32:04,515
- No, thanks.
- We're taking you out.

1291
01:32:04,691 --> 01:32:08,149
- We're gonna get you cleaned up.
- I don't feel like it.

1292
01:32:12,599 --> 01:32:16,797
I know these two white dudes that got
a car that you might be interested in.

1293
01:32:16,970 --> 01:32:21,270
- I don't want another car, Hug.
- Come on, at least take a look.

1294
01:32:24,144 --> 01:32:27,477
My car. Where did you...?

1295
01:32:35,655 --> 01:32:37,714
Hey, Hutch, who the hell
are these guys?

1296
01:32:37,891 --> 01:32:40,451
I don't know, but I get
a good vibe from them.

1297
01:32:43,263 --> 01:32:44,525
So you selling the car?

1298
01:32:44,697 --> 01:32:47,791
Well, actually, your friend here
has already paid for it.

1299
01:32:50,103 --> 01:32:52,298
I owe you one, Huggy.

1300
01:32:53,573 --> 01:32:57,600
- All right.
- Come on, give him the keys.

1301
01:33:03,450 --> 01:33:06,147
Thank you. Thank you.

1302
01:33:06,387 --> 01:33:09,720
With this transmission,
you really wanna jump the clutch.

1303
01:33:09,890 --> 01:33:12,450
- I usually...
- From second to fourth. I got it.

1304
01:33:12,626 --> 01:33:15,094
<i>- Right.
- Come in, Zebra 3. We have a 420.</i>

1305
01:33:15,262 --> 01:33:17,127
<i>Please respond.</i>

1306
01:33:20,634 --> 01:33:24,730
This is Zebra 3. We're on it.
Hutch, let's roll.

1307
01:33:24,905 --> 01:33:26,896
I think he means you.

1308
01:33:28,175 --> 01:33:30,575
- Good luck.
- Allow me.

1309
01:33:30,744 --> 01:33:33,304
- All right, thank you.
- You're welcome.

1310
01:33:33,714 --> 01:33:35,272
All right.

1311
01:33:35,449 --> 01:33:36,882
Hey!

1312
01:33:37,518 --> 01:33:39,611
Not the...

1313
01:33:42,022 --> 01:33:45,287
- How does it feel?
- It feels pretty good.

1314
01:33:45,459 --> 01:33:47,689
I'm gonna take it slow,
get the feel of it.

1315
01:33:47,862 --> 01:33:49,523
No, no, that's smart. Do that.

1316
01:33:54,869 --> 01:33:56,200
- Starsky.
- Hang on.

1317
01:33:57,404 --> 01:34:00,032
- No. No!
- Hang on!

1318
