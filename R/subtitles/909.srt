1
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:39,288
Never thought that I'd be fighting you

2
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:43,668
But you stole my heart
You cheated and lied

3
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:50,174
You weren't in my corner
You weren't on my side

4
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:52,343
The gloves are off

5
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:55,638
You hit below the belt

6
00:00:55,806 --> 00:01:01,144
Now it's timeout, baby
And they've rung the bell

7
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,188
I'm not a fighter, I'm a lover

8
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:07,108
But if you run, then run for cover

9
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:10,653
Fight for your love
Yeah

10
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:20,872
When it's round two, girl

11
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:23,207
Turn this up! Now!
Good.

12
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:25,293
I get a knockout punch

13
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:27,670
With this heartfelt song

14
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:32,508
I know when I count you down from 1 0

15
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:38,723
I'll find you in my loving arms again

16
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:44,645
The gloves are off
You hit below the belt

17
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:50,234
Now it's timeout, baby
And they've rung the bell

18
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:53,321
I'm not a fighter, I'm a lover

19
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:56,365
But if you run, then run for cover

20
00:01:56,533 --> 00:02:00,369
Fight for your love
Yeah

21
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:26,312
I'm not a fighter, I'm a lover

22
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,190
But if you run, then run for cover

23
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:32,819
Fight for your love
Yeah

24
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:47,041
Whoa, nobody caught me.
That was lame.

25
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,252
I don't think he's moving.

26
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:03,933
He is a lazy freeloader and it's time
for all this dysfunction to stop.

27
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:06,185
Can't we just do this later?

28
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:09,105
I mean, you know
how he gets in the morning.

29
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:13,442
Ned, aren't you tired
of letting people push you around?

30
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:15,278
Yes.

31
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:18,614
Then get in there and do it.

32
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,954
What? What is it?

33
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:29,333
Dewey, hey,
it's the first of the month, and

34
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,752
I'd like your share of the rent now.

35
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,629
Man, you know I don't have it.

36
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:36,465
You wake me up for that?
Come on, man !

37
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,634
Sorry.

38
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:45,182
Dewey, I mean,
you owe me a lot of money as it is.

39
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,143
Yeah, try $2,200.

40
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:50,146
Okay, you guys,

41
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:54,150
the band is about to hit it big time.
We'll win Battle of the Bands.

42
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:59,155
When I'm rolling in Benjamins, I'll throw
you and your dog a bone. Good night.

43
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:02,992
-Your band has never made two cents.
-Patty, come on, I'm on this.

44
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,079
Oh, you're on this? You're on this?
He's walking all over you.

45
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,332
Mommy, could we please
talk about this later?

46
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,669
No, we can't talk about it later
because we have to go to work.

47
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:17,173
We have jobs.
We contribute to society. All right?

48
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:20,593
I am an assistant
to the mayor of the city. "Hello!"

49
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:24,305
What? Can you get her out of here,
please? Why? Why her?

50
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:27,183
And Ned has
the most important job there is.

51
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:28,768
Temping?

52
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,771
Dewey, a substitute teacher
is not a temp.

53
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:34,440
-He's a babysitter.
-Think it's so easy?

54
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,234
I'd like to see you try.
You wouldn't last a day.

55
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,570
Dude, I service society by rocking.

56
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:42,448
I'm out there
liberating people with my music.

57
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:45,117
Rocking ain't no walk in the park, lady.

58
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,411
All right, this is useless, all right?

59
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:51,582
Tell him if he doesn't come up
with the rent by the end of the week,

60
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,042
he's out of here.

61
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,212
Dewey, I'm not paying
your share of the rent, so

62
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,465
maybe you should sell
one of your guitars or something.

63
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,591
What?

64
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:04,136
Would you tell Picasso
to sell his guitars?

65
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:08,474
Oh, my God. He's an idiot.

66
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,979
Dude, I've been mooching off you
for years

67
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,440
and it was never a problem
until she showed up. Dump her.

68
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:19,235
If you don't come up with some money,
she'll dump me.

69
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:22,405
Really? That would be good.
She's a nightmare.

70
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,157
Come on. I may never have
another girlfriend.

71
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:29,954
I mean, just come on. Come up
with some money, please. Please.

72
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,165
Okay. For you.
Not for her, man. For you.

73
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:35,292
Thank you.

74
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:38,671
Heal me
I'm heartsick

75
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:39,797
D minor.

76
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:45,177
I'm hungry
And A minor, G, on you

77
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,303
Heal my heart

78
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:47,513
Hey! What's up?

79
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,932
ls that a new song? Who's this guy?

80
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,310
We're taking the Battle of the Bands
seriously this year.

81
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,188
Good, because I need the money.
Now, listen.

82
00:05:56,314 --> 00:06:00,735
If we're gonna win this thing, we gotta
actually start playing some music.

83
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,528
I agree. You're fired.

84
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:06,323
Your lyrics, now don't take this
the wrong way, Theo, are lame.

85
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:10,119
But I've been sitting
on some awesome material, so. . .

86
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,121
Did you hear what I said?

87
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,664
We voted.

88
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:15,416
You're out.

89
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,877
This is Spider. He's replacing you.

90
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:19,837
What's up, dog?

91
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,967
I was gonna tell you last night,
but you passed out, man.

92
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,888
You're gonna kick me out of the band?
You're gonna fire me?

93
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:32,558
-It's my band. I brought us together.
-Theo wanted you out.

94
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:37,146
-There's nothing I could do.
-Shut up, man. You voted him out, too.

95
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,065
Dewey, listen to me.

96
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,067
You're a good guitar player,

97
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:46,280
but it's the 20-minute solos,
it's the stage dives.

98
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:50,076
We're trying to land a record deal here,
man, and you're an embarrassment.

99
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,370
Read between the lines, Theo.

100
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,040
Read between the lines!

101
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:59,043
Dewey, man, I hope
this doesn't come between us.

102
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,045
Like, I care about you, man.

103
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:04,381
You guys, you know what?
You're nuts. You're all nuts.

104
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:08,344
You've been focused so hard
on making it, you forgot about one thing.

105
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:12,556
It's called the music. And I don't
even care. You know what? So what.

106
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:16,060
I don't wanna hang out
with wannabe corporate sell-outs.

107
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:19,563
I'm gonna form my own band.
We're gonna start a revolution.

108
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:24,151
And you're gonna be
a funny little footnote on my epic ass.

109
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:35,454
I feel sorry for you guys.

110
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:42,378
Yes.

111
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,883
Yeah, it's a 1 968 Gibson SG,
mint condish.

112
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,553
No.

113
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,305
That's all?
Well, that's a mistake.

114
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,183
No, Hendrix played this guitar.

115
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,144
Hello?

116
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:09,071
-Yeah?
-Is this Mr Schneebly?

117
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,573
No, he's not here.

118
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,493
-Could you take a message for me?
-Yeah.

119
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,745
Hi. My name's Rosalie Mullins.

120
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:21,083
I'm the principal at Horace Green Prep.
We're having a little emergency.

121
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:24,378
One of our teachers
broke her leg this morning

122
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:26,881
and all of our subs are already working.

123
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:31,135
Pat Wickam at Milton Prep
recommended I call Mr Schneebly.

124
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:33,095
Do you know if he's available?

125
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:37,433
-How long is the gig?
-Excuse me?

126
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:39,768
How long is the job?

127
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,729
As much as a few weeks,

128
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:44,231
but we need somebody
to start immediately.

129
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,109
So how much are we talking here?

130
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,946
We pay our substitutes 650 a week.

131
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:54,283
Now, do you know
when Mr Schneebly will be back?

132
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,744
Hold on a sec. Oh, you know what?

133
00:08:56,912 --> 00:09:01,123
I think he's just coming in right. . .
Ned, phone!

134
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:10,132
Hello, this is Ned Schneebly.

135
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,022
Pat faxed me your résumé.
It's very impressive.

136
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:29,109
We've never been in a bind like this
before, so thank you so much.

137
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:32,613
So how's this gonna work?
Are you gonna pay me up front?

138
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:33,989
I don't understand.

139
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,909
It'd be really great
if I could get paid in cash.

140
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,036
Oh, well, we don't do that.

141
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:43,332
When you cut my cheque, make it
payable to Dewey Finn, for tax reasons.

142
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,586
You can discuss all of that
with Candace at the end of the day.

143
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:48,879
When's the end of the day?

144
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:52,007
We commence at 8. 1 5,
school lets out at 3.00.

145
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:54,843
You know what?

146
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:59,515
Do you think I could cut out a little
early today? I got some stuff I gotta do.

147
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,310
It's cool. I can stay.

148
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,355
Mr Schneebly,

149
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,942
this is considered
the best elementary school in the state,

150
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:13,737
and we maintain that
by adhering to a strict code of conduct,

151
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:15,322
faculty included.

152
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:17,908
Don't worry about me. I'm a hard-ass.

153
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:21,328
If a kid gets out of line,
I got no problem smacking him.

154
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:25,124
No, no. We don't use
corporal punishment here.

155
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,668
Okay, so just verbal abuse?

156
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:32,631
If you have any problems
with any students, send them to me.

157
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,800
-I will do the disciplining.
-Check.

158
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:41,849
Children.

159
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:45,269
Please take your seats.

160
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:47,980
I'd like to introduce
Miss Dunham's substitute.

161
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,734
This is Mr Schneebly.

162
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:55,904
Why don't you write your name
on the board?

163
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,073
Yes, I will.

164
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:11,128
You know what?
Why don't you all just call me Mr S?

165
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:16,342
Mr S has never taught here
at Horace Green,

166
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:19,595
so I want you all to be
on your best behaviour.

167
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,723
So the curriculum is on the desk.

168
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:26,352
-And do you have any questions?
-Yeah, when's lunch?

169
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,397
The children just had their lunch.

170
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,775
ls there anything else you need?

171
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,155
I'm a teacher.
All I need are minds for moulding.

172
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,617
All right, then. Well, thanks again.
You saved the day.

173
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,710
Okay, who's got food in here?

174
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,883
You're not gonna get in trouble.
I'm hungry.

175
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:03,055
You. What do you got?

176
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,146
That's what I'm talking about.

177
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:19,113
Okay. Teach. Teach. Teach.

178
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,449
All right, look, here's the deal.

179
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:25,953
I've got a hangover.
Who knows what that means?

180
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:30,874
-Doesn't that mean you're drunk?
-No. It means I was drunk yesterday.

181
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,420
-It means you're an alcoholic.
-Wrong.

182
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:37,423
You wouldn't come to work
hung-over unless you were.

183
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,508
Dude, you got a disease.

184
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,804
-What's your name?
-Freddy Jones.

185
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,806
Freddy Jones, shut up.

186
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,475
Shut up.

187
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:51,520
The point is, you all can just chill today.

188
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:54,523
We'll start on this crapola tomorrow.

189
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:59,027
-Yes, Tinker Bell?
-Summer.

190
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:03,282
As class factotum, first I'd like
to just say welcome to Horace Green.

191
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:06,160
-Thank you.
-Any questions about our schedule?

192
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:09,329
Because usually now
Miss Dunham teaches vocabulary,

193
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:13,167
then gives us a pop quiz,
then splits us up into reading groups.

194
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:15,419
-Track B is. . .
-Okay, hey, hey, hey.

195
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:19,131
Miss Dumbum
ain't your teacher today, I am.

196
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,216
And I got a headache and the runs.

197
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,510
So I say time for recess.

198
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:27,473
But, Mr S, that poster
charts everyone's performance.

199
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:30,392
We get stars
when we master the material covered.

200
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:33,770
How do we get gold stars
if we just have recess?

201
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:37,733
-What are these black dots here?
-Demerits.

202
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,573
What kind of a sick school is this?

203
00:13:55,376 --> 00:14:01,215
As long as I'm here, there will be
no grades or gold stars or demerits.

204
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,217
We're gonna have recess all the time.

205
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:07,095
But Miss Dunham
only gives us recess for 1 5 minutes. . .

206
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:11,475
You're not hearing me, girl.
I'm in charge now, okay?

207
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:14,436
And I say recess.

208
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,898
Go. Play and have fun now.

209
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,608
Nice.

210
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,446
Now, you don't want me
to have to call your parents, do you?

211
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:30,285
It's all right, Emily, don't cry.
Just try to be a bit more conscientious.

212
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,037
Would you like a hug?

213
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:36,875
I'll be good, I swear!

214
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:40,587
All right, well, that's fine, Emily.
You're excused.

215
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,521
Yes! We did it. We did it. Come on.

216
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:01,483
Give me some. Give me some.
Give me some. Give me some of that.

217
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:05,654
I will see you cats on the flip-flop. Later!

218
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,699
I heard she slipped in the bathroom.

219
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,994
Yes, but we've got
a wonderful new substitute

220
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,162
who comes very highly recommended.

221
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:18,500
-Mr Schneebly? Mr Schneebly?
-Yeah !

222
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,419
Hold on, buddy!

223
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:29,511
Oh, my God.
You've gotta be kidding me.

224
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,556
Oh, man, this guy sucks, man.

225
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,476
-Here, call him.
-Call him? Yeah, right.

226
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:49,698
Okay. Yes, you can be in my band.

227
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:52,075
But, Ned, no power plays, man.

228
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,995
I've got vision up the butt,
so just go with it.

229
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,913
No, thanks.

230
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,541
You're not a teacher, Ned.

231
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,710
You're the cross-dressing,
blood-sucking

232
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,211
incubus from Maggot Death.

233
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:04,671
That's the real you.

234
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:07,633
Dewey, I'm not a satanic
sex god any more.

235
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:10,719
I'm a working stiff. And that's cool.

236
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:13,764
-She's got you brainwashed.
-I'm working.

237
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,350
That's terrific. But who are you, babe?

238
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,809
This is my apartment, babe.

239
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,480
Not if you don't pay your rent, it's not.
Get a job.

240
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:25,734
I got a job. I'll have rent by the end
of the week. Go tell the mayor.

241
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:29,363
-You got a job. Doing what?
-I do what Ned does. Temping.

242
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:33,742
I'm not a temp. I'm a sub.
And soon I'll be a certified teacher.

243
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:38,664
Come on, man ! One show,
$20,000 prize, we split it 60/40.

244
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:41,249
Grab your bass
and come back to the garage.

245
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,919
I mean, don't you miss rocking out?

246
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:47,381
If you think anyone
is gonna be in a band with you,

247
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,716
you're more delusional than I thought.

248
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:54,346
Dewey, you know,
maybe it's time to give up those dreams.

249
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:58,725
I did, and things are going
really great for me.

250
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:19,621
Are you gonna teach us anything
or are we just gonna sit here?

251
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:23,041
Just do whatever you want.

252
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:28,630
-I want to learn from my teacher.
-Besides that.

253
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,758
Freddy, what do you like to do?

254
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,010
I don't know. Burn stuff.

255
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:38,098
Just go out and have recess.

256
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:43,562
My parents don't spend
$1 5,000 a year for recess.

257
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,816
-You want to learn something?
-Yes, I do.

258
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,985
You want me to teach you something?

259
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:52,487
All right, here's a useful lesson for you.

260
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:55,365
Give up. Just quit.

261
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,869
Because in this life, you can't win.

262
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:03,165
Yeah, you can try, but in the end
you're just gonna lose, big time,

263
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:05,625
because the world is run by The Man.

264
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,169
-Who?
-The Man.

265
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,503
Oh, you don't know The Man?

266
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,589
Well, he's everywhere.

267
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:14,259
In the White House, down the hall.
Miss Mullins, she's The Man.

268
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:19,014
And The Man ruined the ozone,
and he's burning down the Amazon,

269
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,350
and he kidnapped Shamu
and put her in a chlorine tank.

270
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:26,855
There used to be a way to stick it
to The Man. It was called rock 'n' roll.

271
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,857
But guess what. Oh, no.

272
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:32,360
The Man ruined that, too,
with a little thing called MTV!

273
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:34,654
So don't waste your time

274
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:37,616
trying to make anything cool
or pure or awesome.

275
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,661
The Man's just gonna call you a fat,
washed-up loser and crush your soul.

276
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:44,039
So do yourselves a favour
and just give up!

277
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,255
Mr Schneebly, it's after 1 0:00.

278
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,884
On Tuesdays
the children have music class now.

279
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:58,553
Right. Okay. Good work, people.

280
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:03,141
We will continue with our lecture
on The Man when we return.

281
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:04,726
Have a good music class.

282
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:46,286
Mr S, what's going on?

283
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:50,332
I heard you in music class.

284
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,834
You guys can really play.

285
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:55,629
Why didn't anyone tell me? You.

286
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,839
-What's your name?
-Zack.

287
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,633
-You play the guitar?
-Yeah.

288
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:00,759
Okay, come here.

289
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:06,681
-Ever play electric guitar?
-My dad won't let me.

290
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,684
-He thinks it's a waste of time.
-A waste of. . .

291
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:13,188
Try this one.

292
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:17,067
Okay, here's a guitar pick.

293
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:20,487
You pluck along with me, okay?
If you can.

294
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:49,891
Yes.

295
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:06,074
Yes!

296
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:10,745
Okay, you stay right there. Don't move.

297
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:13,707
Piano man, front and centre.

298
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:16,167
-What's your name?
-Lawrence.

299
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,629
Lawrence, you ever
played keyboards? Any techno?

300
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:23,049
-No, I only play piano.
-Okay. All right, fair enough.

301
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:26,970
Try this out for me, okay?
Just give this a try on my count.

302
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:29,723
One, two, three, four.

303
00:22:31,726 --> 00:22:33,393
Yes.

304
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:38,398
Come on, come on
Come on, come on

305
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,650
Now touch me, babe

306
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:43,403
Can't you see that I am not afraid?

307
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:48,867
Lawrence is good at piano

308
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:52,120
He shall be rocking in my show

309
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:55,999
Stop. That's perfect. You're perfect.
Stay right there, okay?

310
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:59,169
You. Could you come up here, please?

311
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,087
-What was your name?
-Katie.

312
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,923
What was that big thing
you were playing today?

313
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,383
Cello.

314
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:08,136
This is a bass guitar.
It's exactly the same,

315
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:13,224
but instead of playing like this, you tip it
on the side, "chello", you've got a bass.

316
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:14,809
Try it on.

317
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:19,147
Okay, now play this note right here.
That's a G.

318
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:22,150
Okay, but let your fingers do the rocking.

319
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:24,444
Keep that G coming all day long.

320
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:25,987
G, G, G, G, G, G

321
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:29,657
Good. Stop. Are there any drummers
in the house?

322
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:33,495
-I play percussion.
-You couldn't play anything else.

323
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,038
-Shut up!
-Come here, dude.

324
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:43,338
Just see if you can do what I do.
Just give it a try.

325
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:49,177
Okay? Give that a try.

326
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,184
Okay!

327
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:59,145
That's really good. Just stay right here.

328
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:03,858
All right, okay.
Lawrence, give me a G note.

329
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:07,028
With the fifth above it.

330
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:10,448
And the middle one.
No middle one, I changed my mind.

331
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:12,075
Now go an octave below.

332
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:14,369
Now give me some rhythm.

333
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:17,247
And keep that same rhythm. Go.

334
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,707
Katie, remember that note, the G?

335
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:23,753
Play it, but also keep it rocking. Good.

336
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,005
Okay, give me like a. . . Like a. . .

337
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:31,803
That's bad.
That's like George of the Jungle.

338
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:34,889
Play it up here on the cymbal,
but really light.

339
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:38,226
Oh, that's it! Okay, keep going with that.

340
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:41,813
You remember this thing
I taught you a minute ago?

341
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,067
Yes! Yes!

342
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:50,071
All right, let's go!

343
00:24:56,537 --> 00:25:01,541
Stop. You guys, stop messing around.
We've got a lot of work to do.

344
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:06,462
Okay, people, pay attention, because
I do not want to have to fail you.

345
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,048
I thought you didn't believe in grades.

346
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:13,344
Of course I believe in grades.
I was testing you. You passed.

347
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:16,222
Good work, Summer.
Four-and-a-half stars for you.

348
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:20,935
Now, listen, normal kids
would have been stoked to slack off,

349
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:24,480
but not you guys, 'cause
you're not normal. You're special.

350
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,941
Because you guys
have the right attitude,

351
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:30,278
I think it's time
we started our new class project.

352
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,905
-A science project?
-No.

353
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:35,950
It's called "Rock Band".

354
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:38,953
-ls this a school project?
-Yes.

355
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:40,371
And it's a requirement.

356
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:43,458
It may sound easy,
but nothing could be harder.

357
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:49,047
It will test your head and your mind
and your brain, too.

358
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,299
Will other schools be competing?

359
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:54,093
You could say that.

360
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,846
You could say that every school
in the state

361
00:25:56,931 --> 00:25:59,140
will be competing for the top prize.

362
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:00,808
What's the prize?

363
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:06,314
A win will go on your permanent record.
Hello, Harvard, yo.

364
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:10,151
We're not supposed
to get started until next quarter,

365
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:14,072
but I think we should get a leg up
on the competition, don't you?

366
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:15,531
I do.

367
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,618
-Who else wants to go for the gold?
-I do.

368
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:22,372
All right. But if anyone finds out,
we'll be disqualified.

369
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:25,583
So let's just keep it
on the down-low, shall we?

370
00:26:25,668 --> 00:26:28,419
-Can we tell our parents?
-No! Trust me.

371
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:30,713
They don't want to know. Keep it zipped.

372
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:34,342
All right, you guys,
let's kick it into overdrive.

373
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:36,344
What are the rest of us supposed to do?

374
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:40,181
You just sit back
and enjoy the magic of rock.

375
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:42,558
You mean we're not in the band?

376
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:46,521
Now, hold up now.

377
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:51,025
Just 'cause you're not in the band
doesn't mean you're not in the band.

378
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:53,569
We need back-up singers.
Who can sing?

379
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,031
You, sing.

380
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:58,616
The sun'll come out tomorrow

381
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:00,368
Yes.

382
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:04,038
Bet your bottom dollar
that tomorrow...

383
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:08,626
Stop. You've got it, and I don't
even know what it is, but you've got it.

384
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:12,213
And that's why you're in the band.
You, sing.

385
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:17,218
Amazing grace

386
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:21,931
How sweet the sound

387
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,308
That saved...

388
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:24,809
Stop, before I start crying.

389
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:28,146
I found the missing ingredient.
You're in the band.

390
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:30,732
-I can sing.
-You can?

391
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:32,942
All right, Summer, belt it.

392
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:36,988
Memory
All alone in the moonlight...

393
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:38,781
Stop. Stop. Okay.

394
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,242
Good. That's pretty good. All right.

395
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:44,704
-I can also play clarinet.
-I'll find something for you.

396
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:49,375
When we get back from lunch,
I'll assign the rest of you killer positions.

397
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,591
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

398
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,384
-There we go.
-Thank you.

399
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,094
You're welcome.

400
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:11,189
-Mr Schneebly?
-Yeah?

401
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:12,648
Hey, what's up?

402
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:16,444
-I don't think I should be in the band.
-Why not?

403
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:20,073
I'm not cool enough.
People in bands are cool. I'm not cool.

404
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,952
Dude, you are cool. The way you play.
Why do you say you're not cool?

405
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:28,247
Nobody ever talks to me.

406
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:30,750
Well, those days are over, buddy.

407
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,669
You could be the ugliest sad sack
on the planet,

408
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:37,298
but if you're in a rocking band,
you're the cat's pyjamas.

409
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:40,259
-You're the bee's knees.
-Bee's knees?

410
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,095
Yeah, the bee's knees.

411
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,222
You'll be
the most popular guy in school.

412
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:46,474
Okay. I'll do it.

413
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:52,230
Now, listen. This is a big commitment.
Don't say yes if you're gonna flake out.

414
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:54,690
-I won't.
-Larry,

415
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:57,151
welcome to my world.

416
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:00,863
Boom.

417
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:04,534
Boom, a couple of these. Now, here.

418
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:08,788
Now give me a platform.
Let's rock, let's rock today.

419
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:10,289
Now do it to me.

420
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:12,750
-Let's rock, let's rock today.
-That's good.

421
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:14,085
Slap it.

422
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,754
Shoot it.

423
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:17,964
Kaboot it.

424
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:21,509
We'll work on that later.
It's a long shake. Get going.

425
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,178
Good knuckle crack.

426
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,565
Lead guitar,

427
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:38,359
Zack Attack. Take a seat.

428
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:42,989
On bass, Posh Spice.

429
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:46,409
On keyboards, Mr Cool.

430
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:49,328
And on drums, Spazzy McGee.

431
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:52,081
Okay, Blondie, Brace Face,

432
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,542
you're singing back-up.

433
00:29:55,210 --> 00:30:00,840
All right, Tough Guy, Shortstop,
Fancy Pants, get over here.

434
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,550
You're on security detail.

435
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:05,761
Make sure no one outside
knows what we're doing.

436
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:07,763
The band's future depends on you.

437
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:11,726
Okay, your first mission,
soundproofing this room.

438
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,853
Get on it.

439
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,230
Can I be the band stylist instead?

440
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:18,232
Of course you can, Fancy Pants.

441
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,236
Okay. Carrot Top, Roadrunner,
Turkey Sub,

442
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:24,405
we are gonna have a lot of equipment.

443
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:26,866
We're talking amps, electric guitars,

444
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,911
maybe even lasers
and smoke machines.

445
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,747
Now, your job
is to master the transportation

446
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:35,166
and operation of this technology.

447
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:39,295
Without a first-rate roadie crew,
we'll never have a psychedelic show,

448
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:41,297
and I can't live with that, okay?

449
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:44,258
I'm counting on you. Get going. Go.

450
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:46,427
All right.

451
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:48,596
You three,

452
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,600
groupies. And your job is simple.

453
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,477
Just worship the band.

454
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,564
You're gonna be making hats,
you're gonna be making T-shirts,

455
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:02,193
all kinds of merchandise,
which leads me to your first assignment.

456
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,612
-Naming the band.
-Yes.

457
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,281
All right. Sit down.

458
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:13,579
As for me, I will be singing lead vocal
and shredding guitar.

459
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:16,791
Wait. Isn't this a student project?

460
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:20,795
-What's your point?
-Are you supposed to be in the band?

461
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:25,132
What, you want to get rid of me?
Why, because I'm old?

462
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,468
You hate teachers,
is that what you're about?

463
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,471
Okay, well, teachers like to play, too.

464
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:34,850
And not only am I gonna play,
I'm el capitano, and what I say goes.

465
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,936
So put your hands over your hearts.

466
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:43,150
-I pledge allegiance. . .
-I pledge allegiance. . .

467
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,736
-. . .to the band. . .
-. . .to the band. . .

468
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,990
-. . .of Mr Schneebly.
-. . .of Mr Schneebly.

469
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:51,784
-And will not fight. . .
-And will not fight. . .

470
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:55,288
-. . .for creative control.
-. . .for creative control.

471
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,498
And will defer to him on all issues

472
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:00,293
related to the musical direction
of the band.

473
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:04,046
-And will defer to him. . .
-Direction. . .

474
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,593
Let's get rocking !

475
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:28,195
-Morning, Summer.
-Groupie?

476
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:31,949
-What's the matter?
-You want me to be a groupie?

477
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:35,911
-Groupie is an important job.
-I researched groupies on the Internet.

478
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:38,039
They're sluts. They sleep with the band.

479
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:41,042
No. That's not true.
They're like cheerleaders.

480
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:45,296
I don't want to be a cheerleader.
Look, my mother is a room parent,

481
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:48,132
and she's not gonna be happy
when she hears about this.

482
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:52,511
Okay, I didn't want to say this
in front of the other kids,

483
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,889
but I made a special position
just for you.

484
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:57,141
It's the most important job of all.

485
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:59,018
Band manager.

486
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:01,479
-Band manager?
-Oh, yeah.

487
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:02,938
What's that?

488
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,900
I'm gonna be busy rocking out,
so it's up to you

489
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:08,361
to make sure
everyone is doing their job.

490
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,905
Summer, you're in charge of everything.

491
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,784
-Okay.
-Okay.

492
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:19,955
All right, look alive. Listen up.

493
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,750
First thing you do
when you start a band. . .

494
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:27,213
Mr Schneebly, before we start,
shouldn't I first take attendance?

495
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,757
Okay, fine.

496
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:35,763
Okay. Now.

497
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:37,598
-Michelle?
-Here.

498
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:40,434
-Okay. And Marco?
-Here.

499
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:44,063
Okay. Summer. Here.

500
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,440
-Let's see. Tomika?
-We're all here.

501
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:52,738
The first thing you do when you start
a band is talk about your influences.

502
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:56,951
That's how you figure out what kind
of band to be. So who do you like?

503
00:33:57,661 --> 00:34:00,079
-Blondie?
-Christina Aguilera.

504
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:03,082
Who? No. Come on. What?

505
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,960
-You, Shortstop.
-Puff Daddy.

506
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:09,463
-Wrong. Billy?
-Liza Minnelli?

507
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:11,966
What are you. . . You guys!

508
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:14,385
This project is called "Rock Band".

509
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:17,138
I'm talking about bands that rock.

510
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:19,598
Led Zeppelin.

511
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:27,273
Don't tell me you guys
never got the Led out.

512
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:29,650
Jimmy Page, Robert Plant?

513
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:32,027
Ring any bells?

514
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,988
What about Sabbath?

515
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:36,031
AC/DC?

516
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:37,992
Motorhead?

517
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,828
Oh, what do they teach in this place?

518
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:45,499
Summer, you're the class whatever,
go to the board.

519
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:47,001
Factotum.

520
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:49,503
"Factotor".

521
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:51,380
New schedule.

522
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:55,217
8. 1 5 to 1 0:00, Rock History.

523
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:59,889
1 0:00 to 1 1 :00,
Rock Appreciation and Theory.

524
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,516
Then band practice
till the end of the day.

525
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:05,019
-What about math?
-No. Not important.

526
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:07,188
-World cultures?
-Not important.

527
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:10,357
We need to focus.
Don't you wanna win this contest?

528
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:11,942
It's prestigious.

529
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:14,069
Question.

530
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:16,697
How are we being graded in all this?

531
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:21,410
Since I'm band manager, and I have
the most responsibility, wouldn't. . .

532
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:26,165
Summer, if you grade-grub, I will send
you back to the first grade. You got it?

533
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:29,794
-Back to your seat now.
-Fine.

534
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:34,048
-What are we gonna play?
-You don't have to worry about that.

535
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:36,926
We have awesome material,
which I wrote.

536
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:38,344
Let's hear it.

537
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:42,890
-What?
-Let's hear your song.

538
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:45,059
You wanna hear my song?

539
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,478
I'll play you my song, if you want.

540
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:51,065
The thing is,
I just want you to keep in mind,

541
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:53,400
I wrote it in, like, 1 5 minutes.

542
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:58,113
-It's not done. You might not like. . .
-Just play the song, Schneebly.

543
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,660
Okay, I will sing it for you,
but let me just get in the zone.

544
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:05,204
I was not planning on unveiling it,

545
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:08,082
but I will sing it.

546
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:12,586
Tip of the tongue, teeth and the lips.

547
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:18,217
Okay.

548
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:19,802
It starts off,

549
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:22,012
a dark stage,

550
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,931
and then a beam of light,

551
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:27,142
and you can see me and my guitar.

552
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,774
In the end of time

553
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:37,236
There was a man who knew the road

554
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:42,449
And the writing
was written on the stone

555
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,786
And then a thin layer of fog
comes in around my ankles.

556
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:49,582
Roadies, that means dry ice.
We're gonna talk about this later.

557
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:52,459
In the ancient time

558
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:55,129
An artist led the way

559
00:36:55,255 --> 00:37:00,467
But no one seemed to understand

560
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:02,845
Chimes, Freddy.

561
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:05,806
In his heart he knew

562
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:09,018
The artist must be true

563
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:13,981
But the legend of the rent
was way past due

564
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,859
And then, Katie,
you come in with the bass.

565
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:26,827
Well, you think you'll be just fine
without me, but you're mine

566
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:29,830
You think you can
kick me out of the band

567
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:32,666
And then, Zack, you come in
with a face-melter.

568
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,004
Okay?

569
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:39,381
Well, there's just one problem there

570
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:42,009
The band is mine

571
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:46,972
How can you kick me out
of what is mine?

572
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,474
And then. . .

573
00:37:48,642 --> 00:37:51,101
Hawaii Five-O.
You ever see that show?

574
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,187
Okay, well,
there's a drum solo in it that goes. . .

575
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,690
You're not hardcore

576
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:58,692
Unless you live hardcore

577
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,195
And I want the back-up singers
to be like. . .

578
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:04,031
Well, you're not hardcore
No, you're not hardcore

579
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:07,034
Unless you live...
Unless you live hardcore

580
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:11,830
But the legend of the rent
was way hardcore

581
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:14,583
Boom ! Big old explosion.

582
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:17,252
Some, like, confetti comes down.

583
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,339
That's all I got so far.
It's a work in progress.

584
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:23,884
I liked it, Mr Schneebly.
I thought it was really catchy.

585
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:27,137
Thank you.

586
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,557
Mr S? We came up
with some names for the band.

587
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,227
-Yeah? Hit me.
-The Bumblebees?

588
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:35,437
-No, it's sissy.
-The Koala Bears?

589
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,898
What are you talking about? It's sissy.

590
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:40,359
I need to speak with Principal Mullins.

591
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:43,237
Hey, Miss Mullins.
Hello. How's it going?

592
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:45,906
-How about "Pig Rectum"?
-Michelle!

593
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:47,700
It's a science project.

594
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:52,246
Listen, Ros, I was thinking
about organising a field trip.

595
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:54,748
-What do you think about that?
-Well,

596
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:58,168
substitutes, as a rule,
do not organise field trips.

597
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:00,838
But I figure I'm gonna be here
for a while.

598
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:03,924
Well, that remains to be seen.

599
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:06,552
-Have you met our other teachers?
-No.

600
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,139
But the kids could learn
by getting out of the classroom.

601
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:13,600
It's more complicated than that.
There's safety issues.

602
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:17,187
Parents need to be notified.
It's against school policy.

603
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:20,274
Mr S, I have a lot of ideas.

604
00:39:20,442 --> 00:39:23,736
How about everyone in magenta
with beads and sequins?

605
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:26,572
Billy, I'm talking to Principal Mullins.

606
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,782
-Oh, hi.
-William.

607
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,617
I'll make up some samples.

608
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:35,122
Everyone, this is Ned Schneebly.
He's covering for Gail.

609
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:38,292
Gabe Green. He teaches second.
Jane Lemmons, fourth.

610
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:39,793
Bob's our PE teacher.

611
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:42,379
-Roberta's our librarian.
-How do you do?

612
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:45,215
-Care to join us, Mr Schneebly?
-Yeah.

613
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:49,970
-Did I say that correctly? "Schneebly"?
-Actually, it's "Schnayblay".

614
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,139
We were just discussing testing.

615
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:55,350
Which test do you find most effective,
the TASS or the Wilson-Binet?

616
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:59,646
I say no testing,
and I will tell you why, Joe.

617
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:02,816
-Gabe.
-Gabe. I believe

618
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:05,903
that the children are the future.

619
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:07,905
Now, you can teach them well,

620
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:10,324
but you have gotta let them
lead the way.

621
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:13,327
Let the children's laughter

622
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:15,454
just remind us how we used to be.

623
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,540
That's what I decided long ago.

624
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:21,168
Isn't that a song?

625
00:40:22,212 --> 00:40:25,464
No. I don't think so. No.

626
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,007
-No?
-No, it isn't.

627
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:28,801
You sure?

628
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:37,851
So you think you'll be just fine
without me, but you're mine

629
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:42,856
You think you can
kick me out of the band

630
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:47,361
Well, there's just one problem there

631
00:40:47,529 --> 00:40:50,447
The band is mine

632
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:54,701
How can you kick me out
of what is mine?

633
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,203
Everybody.

634
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:59,456
-Because you're not hardcore
-No, you're not hardcore

635
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:02,668
-Unless you live hardcore
-Unless you live hardcore

636
00:41:02,836 --> 00:41:07,881
But the legend of the rent
was way hardcore

637
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:10,050
All right. Good. Stop.

638
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:12,010
Okay, Freddy, that was awesome.

639
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:14,721
You're rocking,
but it's a little sloppy-joe.

640
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:17,266
Tighten up the screws, okay?

641
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:20,686
Zack, dude,
what's up with the stiffness, man?

642
00:41:20,854 --> 00:41:24,398
You're looking a little robotronic. Okay?

643
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:27,526
Let's grease up the hinges, and listen,

644
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:30,529
loosey-goosey, baby, loosey-goosey.

645
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:34,408
-I'm playing it the way you told me.
-I know. It's perfect.

646
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:38,537
But rock is about the passion, man.
Where's the joy?

647
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:42,499
You're lead guitarist. We are
counting on you for style, brother.

648
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:46,420
So try out this ancient technique.
It's called "power stance".

649
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:49,047
That's it. You own the universe.

650
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:51,717
Now, give me an E chord. Just go. . .

651
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:54,553
But let me hear. . .

652
00:41:55,305 --> 00:41:59,725
Yeah, now raise your goblet of rock.
It's a toast to those who rock.

653
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:03,353
Now smile and nod your head
and let me see your eyeballs wide

654
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,772
like there's something wrong. Yeah !

655
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,858
Do it again. Give me that. . .

656
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:12,654
That's what I'm talking about.
Okay, let's do it again.

657
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:15,324
From "You're not hardcore".
One, two, three.

658
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:18,327
-You're not hardcore
-No, you're not hardcore

659
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:21,538
-Unless you live hardcore
-Unless you live hardcore

660
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:26,293
And the legend of the rent
was way hardcore

661
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:28,962
Yeah ! Now we're rocking.

662
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:32,758
Your homework is to listen
to some real music. Get inspired.

663
00:42:32,926 --> 00:42:35,135
For Blondie, Blondie.

664
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:38,472
For Lawrence, Yes.
That's the name of the band.

665
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,308
Listen to the keyboard solo
on Roundabout.

666
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:45,395
It will blow the classical music
out your butt.

667
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:48,273
Okay, for you, Rush, 21 12.

668
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:52,402
Neil Peart, one of the great drummers
of all time. Study up.

669
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:56,782
-Are we gonna goof off every day?
-We're not goofing off.

670
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,700
We're creating musical fusion.

671
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,078
Are we gonna do that every day?

672
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:03,622
Yeah. Get used to it.

673
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:07,918
Okay, and for you, Jimi Hendrix,
Axis: Bold As Love.

674
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:11,838
-Are you psyched about the project?
-Sure.

675
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:14,466
"Sure"? Hey. Wait. What's up?
Are you. . .

676
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:17,928
You're the lead guitarist
of an unbelievable rock band.

677
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:20,806
-This is a dream come true for you.
-Okay.

678
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,643
All right. I'll see you.

679
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:28,188
-Mr S?
-Hey, Tomika, what's up?

680
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:32,526
-I don't want to be a roadie.
-Why not? It's an important job.

681
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:35,195
All right. Well. . .

682
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:37,614
You wanna be security?

683
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:39,533
I wanna be a singer.

684
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:41,535
A singer?

685
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:44,830
Okay. Sing me something.

686
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:50,043
I can't let you be a singer
if you can't sing.

687
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:54,548
You told me to leave you alone

688
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:58,885
My papa said, "Come on home"

689
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:03,223
My doctor said, "Take it easy"

690
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:06,268
But your loving is much too strong

691
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:11,398
I'm welded to your chain, chain, chain...

692
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:15,485
Oh, my goodness. Nice pipes, Tomika.

693
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:18,739
Why didn't you raise your hand
when I was looking for singers?

694
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:20,699
You're in.

695
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:25,078
Welcome aboard. Okay, perfect.
Pink Floyd, Dark Side of the Moon.

696
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:28,415
Listen to the vocal solo
on The Great Gig in the Sky.

697
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:31,710
All right? All right.

698
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,763
Off to work.

699
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:44,765
Goodbye.

700
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,319
You can play music
after your homework,

701
00:44:57,487 --> 00:44:59,654
after your chores, but not until then.

702
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:03,658
Zack! Zack, do not walk away from me
when I'm talking to you.

703
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:05,744
It's very rude. All right?

704
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:08,622
Last thing. . .
Guitar after homework and chores,

705
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:11,041
and only what Miss Sheinkopf
gives you.

706
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:13,126
-No more rock music. Okay?
-Okay.

707
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:14,461
All right, get to class.

708
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,963
Watch that attitude.

709
00:45:17,799 --> 00:45:20,008
Do you have another blanket?

710
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,012
That's good.

711
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:34,731
All right. Everybody, class has begun.

712
00:45:34,941 --> 00:45:36,274
And you know what?

713
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,819
You guys have been doing
real good in here.

714
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:41,655
If I was gonna give you a grade,
I'd give you an A.

715
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:45,534
But that's the problem.
Rock ain't about doing things perfect.

716
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:47,994
Who can tell me what it's really about?

717
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:50,997
Frankie?

718
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:55,168
-Scoring chicks?
-No. See? No.

719
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:57,212
-Eleni?
-Getting wasted.

720
00:45:57,547 --> 00:45:59,673
No. Come on. No.

721
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:02,008
-Leonard.
-Sticking it to The Man?

722
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:04,678
Yes! But you can't just say it, man.

723
00:46:04,804 --> 00:46:07,180
You gotta feel it in your blood and guts.

724
00:46:07,348 --> 00:46:09,975
If you wanna rock,
you gotta break the rules.

725
00:46:10,143 --> 00:46:13,603
You gotta get mad at The Man,
and right now I'm The Man.

726
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:17,691
That's right, I'm The Man,
and who's got the guts to tell me off?

727
00:46:17,817 --> 00:46:21,319
-Who's gonna tell me off?
-Shut the hell up, Schneebly!

728
00:46:21,863 --> 00:46:24,322
That's it, Freddy. That's it.

729
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:27,617
-Who can top him?
-Get out of here, stupid ass.

730
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:28,827
Yes, Alicia.

731
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:33,123
You're a joke.
You're the worst teacher I've ever had.

732
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:35,041
Summer, that is great.

733
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:38,628
-I like the delivery. I felt your anger.
-Thank you.

734
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:40,297
You're a fat loser
and you have body odour.

735
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:44,426
All right. All right.

736
00:46:44,594 --> 00:46:47,304
-Now, is everyone nice and pissed off?
-Yeah !

737
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:49,306
Good. Time to write a rock song.

738
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:53,226
Now, what makes you mad
more than anything in the world?

739
00:46:56,397 --> 00:46:58,064
-Billy?
-You.

740
00:46:58,399 --> 00:47:00,817
We've already told me off.
Let's move on.

741
00:47:00,902 --> 00:47:04,905
-You're tacky and I hate you.
-Okay, you see me after class.

742
00:47:05,198 --> 00:47:08,158
-You. Gordon.
-No allowance.

743
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:14,247
I didn't get no allowance today
So now I'm really ticked off

744
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:17,167
You know what I mean?
What else makes you mad?

745
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:18,960
-Michelle?
-Chores.

746
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:24,424
I had to do my chores today
So I am really ticked off

747
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:27,469
-What else?
-Bullies.

748
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:32,599
All you bullies get out of my way
'cause I am really ticked off

749
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,687
So, what would you say to a bully?

750
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,773
-Zack?
-I don't know.

751
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:43,610
Now, come on. If someone was
in your grill, what would you say?

752
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:45,529
I don't know.

753
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:47,948
If they pushed you around,
what would you say?

754
00:47:48,241 --> 00:47:49,616
"Step off"?

755
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:54,704
Step off! Step off!
Step off! Step off!

756
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,248
Everybody!

757
00:47:56,415 --> 00:48:01,503
Step off! Step off!
Step off! Step off!

758
00:48:02,255 --> 00:48:07,676
If I do what you say
I might turn into a robot

759
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:11,805
Do my chore day after day
And they don't want any lip

760
00:48:11,973 --> 00:48:18,228
No! So step off! Step off!
Step off! Step off! Step off!

761
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:19,688
Step off, everybody.

762
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:25,110
Step off! Step off!
Step off! Step off!

763
00:48:33,286 --> 00:48:38,331
All right. Now, that
was a perfectly decent rock song.

764
00:48:43,004 --> 00:48:45,714
Grazie. Grazie.

765
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:50,427
Oh, yeah. I was this close to getting
a chair on the Polish Philharmonic,

766
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:54,514
and I nailed the audish,
but I didn't get it. Guess who did.

767
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:58,184
Yo-Yo Ma's cousin, little "nepotis".

768
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:01,479
Anyway, I just decided to give up
and become a teacher,

769
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:04,858
because those that can't do, teach.

770
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:09,154
And those that can't teach,
teach gym. Am I right?

771
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:17,454
-I'm just joshing.
-Cute.

772
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,706
-Hey, Mr Schneebly.
-Hey, Zack.

773
00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:22,375
That was a really cool lesson today.

774
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:23,877
Well, thanks, dude.

775
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:26,171
-I'll see you back in class.
-Okay.

776
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:59,245
Flip it, flip it, flip it, flip it!
No, no, no.

777
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:45,685
I'm just saying,
name two great chick drummers.

778
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:48,521
Sheila E? Meg White
from the White Stripes?

779
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:51,483
-She can't drum.
-She's better than you.

780
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,151
At least she has rhythm.

781
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:57,447
Freddy, where are your sleeves?
And what have you done to your hair?

782
00:51:57,615 --> 00:52:01,743
-It's called punk.
-Well, it's not school uniform.

783
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:08,166
-Miss Mullins, you're The Man.
-Thank you, Frankie.

784
00:52:16,217 --> 00:52:18,051
Good morning. Just a reminder.

785
00:52:18,177 --> 00:52:19,761
Parents' Night is coming up,

786
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:22,472
and I expect everyone
to have a presentation.

787
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:24,766
What? Hot!

788
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:29,854
-You okay?
-It's all right.

789
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:33,775
As you know, it is
the most important event of the year.

790
00:52:34,193 --> 00:52:36,653
The parents scrutinise our every move,

791
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:41,407
so I find it's best to over-prepare.
Right?

792
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:43,868
The best defence is a good offence.

793
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:47,413
And, Roberta, now that I see you. . .

794
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:51,709
Hey, is she always like that?

795
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:54,754
Oh, yeah.

796
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:59,259
Except for the time she got drunk
at the alumni dinner.

797
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:02,303
You should have seen that.

798
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:06,975
She got up on the table
and did a Stevie Nicks impersonation.

799
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:09,227
And she wasn't bad.

800
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:13,398
Remember she took up the tablecloth
and whirled around with it?

801
00:53:13,566 --> 00:53:15,733
. . .that had been on the turkey tray

802
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:19,571
that were touched over
onto the peanut butter and jelly tray.

803
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:23,825
Now, I know that you know
that this is a severe problem.

804
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:31,457
Clear.

805
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:33,960
Come on. Go, go, go!

806
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:51,311
All right, you guys. ls everybody ready?

807
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,980
-Yeah.
-Strap in. Let's do this.

808
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:04,574
Oh, dude, cool.

809
00:54:14,293 --> 00:54:17,170
Three at once. That's very clever.

810
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:24,677
In 1 492, Columbus sailed the ocean...

811
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:28,514
-Blue.
-Blue. That's right.

812
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:33,144
Okay. Now, Columbus had three boats.
The Niña, the...

813
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:36,731
-Gordon?
-The Pinta.

814
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:39,651
Pinta, that's right. And...

815
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:42,028
-Marco?
-Santa Marina?

816
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:43,988
The Santa Marina.

817
00:54:44,156 --> 00:54:47,116
That's good. Actually, it's Santa María.

818
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:49,410
Okay. Now, you got...

819
00:54:49,578 --> 00:54:52,288
-Listen. Pay attention, kids.
-She's gone.

820
00:54:52,373 --> 00:54:54,248
I'm not afraid to flunk you.

821
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:55,833
What's up, dude?

822
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:58,002
Check out these little kids, man.

823
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:00,380
-Hey, shut up.
-Oh, sorry.

824
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:04,550
Thought this was Battle of the Bands,
not the Mickey Mouse Club.

825
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:06,886
-Want a piece of me?
-Look at this.

826
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:09,472
Freddy! Come on, man.
We gotta focus up.

827
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:11,265
We gotta nail this audition.

828
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:13,267
Mr S?

829
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:17,271
-What's up?
-I don't think I can sing.

830
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:21,567
What are you talking about? Come here.

831
00:55:25,948 --> 00:55:30,034
So, Tomika, what's going on?
What do you mean, you can't sing?

832
00:55:30,202 --> 00:55:32,578
I don't feel good. I feel sick.

833
00:55:32,997 --> 00:55:35,581
-Just let Alicia and Marta do it.
-No.

834
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:38,292
They can't sing like you can. I need you.

835
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:39,961
What is it? Are you nervous?

836
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,131
Yeah? Why? What are you afraid of?

837
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:48,302
-They're gonna laugh at me.
-Why would they laugh at you?

838
00:55:48,512 --> 00:55:51,472
I don't know. Because I'm fat.

839
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:54,100
Tomika.

840
00:55:55,144 --> 00:55:57,520
Hey, you've got something
everybody wants.

841
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:59,313
You've got talent, girl.

842
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:02,692
You have an incredible voice.
I'm not just saying that.

843
00:56:02,943 --> 00:56:06,946
You heard of Aretha Franklin, right?
Okay, she's a big lady.

844
00:56:07,031 --> 00:56:09,824
But when she sings,
she blows people's minds.

845
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:12,118
Everybody wants to party with Aretha!

846
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:15,288
And you know who else
has a weight issue?

847
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:18,666
-Who?
-Me.

848
00:56:18,834 --> 00:56:23,880
But once I get up on stage, start
doing my thing, people worship me.

849
00:56:24,048 --> 00:56:27,216
Because I'm sexy and chubby, man.

850
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:31,304
-Why aren't you on a diet?
-Because I like to eat.

851
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:35,058
ls that such a crime? You know what?
That's not even the point.

852
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:37,560
The thing is, you're a rock star now.

853
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:40,146
All you gotta do is rock your heart out.

854
00:56:40,314 --> 00:56:42,273
People are gonna dig you, I swear.

855
00:56:42,441 --> 00:56:44,859
Let's just show them what we got.
What do you say?

856
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:46,861
Okay.

857
00:56:48,864 --> 00:56:50,448
Thank you.

858
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:52,533
Let's rock.

859
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:58,247
-Okay. We are good to go.
-No, we're not. Freddy took off.

860
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:01,125
-Where?
-Some guys invited him to their van.

861
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:04,754
What? Come on, you guys!

862
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:08,591
Freddy?

863
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:11,552
Hey, have you seen a little kid,
like, yay high?

864
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:16,849
Dang it. Freddy,
this is your teacher talking !

865
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:20,937
-Hey, Mr S.
-Oh, man.

866
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:25,650
-What's going on here?
-Nothing. Just chilling.

867
00:57:25,734 --> 00:57:28,111
Freddy, get out of that van this instant.

868
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:31,906
See you, guys.

869
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:36,577
You think you're pretty funny,
partying with an innocent little kid?

870
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:38,955
Dude, we're just chilling.

871
00:57:39,123 --> 00:57:41,791
That kid's 1 0 years old.
He looks up to you.

872
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:47,380
You are setting an example for him,
so start acting like a responsible adult!

873
00:57:47,548 --> 00:57:51,050
That goes for all of you guys.
Don't make me come back here.

874
00:57:53,137 --> 00:57:54,971
Come on. Let's go.

875
00:57:55,222 --> 00:57:58,015
What's the big deal?
You're acting like my mom.

876
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:00,810
What's the big deal?
You had me worried sick.

877
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:02,979
I was hanging with real rockers.

878
00:58:03,147 --> 00:58:05,439
They aren't real rockers.
They're poseurs.

879
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:08,568
Rock ain't about getting loaded
and being a jerk.

880
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:12,655
Now, this is serious business here.
We've got a mission.

881
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:15,825
Putting on a great show
is the most important thing.

882
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:18,870
One great rock show
can change the world.

883
00:58:18,954 --> 00:58:21,289
-Do you understand me?
-Yeah.

884
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:25,126
If you ever scare me like that again,
so help me,

885
00:58:25,252 --> 00:58:28,004
I will send a note home
to your parents. Let's go.

886
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:31,465
All right, you guys.
Just wait here for a minute.

887
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:36,220
-Hey, man, check this place out.
-Yeah. It's cool.

888
00:58:36,388 --> 00:58:38,639
Hey, what's going on?
Where is everyone?

889
00:58:38,807 --> 00:58:42,602
-Auditions are over.
-What? Who's in charge?

890
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:45,897
Listen, you can't leave.
You haven't heard our band.

891
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:50,026
-The bill is full. We're overbooked.
-Let us play one song.

892
00:58:50,194 --> 00:58:51,485
We're here. We're ready.

893
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:53,154
-Who are they?
-My band.

894
00:58:53,447 --> 00:58:55,656
Kids? ls this some kind of gimmick?

895
00:58:55,824 --> 00:58:58,868
It's not a gimmick.
They're kids, but they're awesome.

896
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:02,246
Thanks for coming down, but
you're really not what we're looking for.

897
00:59:03,207 --> 00:59:06,167
These kids have worked
their fingers to the bone

898
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:10,046
just to play one song for you,
so sit down, shut up and listen !

899
00:59:10,214 --> 00:59:13,466
Sheila, call security.

900
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:18,095
Oh, God.

901
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:21,224
It was just a warm-up.

902
00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:23,935
We'll still compete
against the other schools.

903
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:27,563
What? This is the gig, Summer.
This was our Woodstock.

904
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:29,982
Then we shouldn't take no
for an answer.

905
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:33,152
Don't take no for an answer?
He was gonna call the fuzz.

906
00:59:33,237 --> 00:59:35,321
Would you just listen to me?

907
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:37,657
I have an idea.

908
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:45,373
Hi there. Hi. It's okay. It's cool.
I just wanted to say I'm really sorry.

909
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,750
I shouldn't have barged in here.

910
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,378
It wasn't fair to you or the kids,

911
00:59:50,462 --> 00:59:52,588
especially after
what they've been through.

912
00:59:52,673 --> 00:59:56,592
God, I feel like a jerk. God.
I'm taking them back to the hospital.

913
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,470
-Just wanted to say I'm sorry.
-That's fine.

914
00:59:59,638 --> 01:00:04,392
See, I volunteer down at St Margarita's,
in the children's wing, teaching music.

915
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:06,978
Really? That's nice. That's very nice.

916
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:10,106
Actually, it isn't,
because I totally screwed up.

917
01:00:10,399 --> 01:00:14,694
I told the kids if they practised,
they'd get into Battle of the Bands.

918
01:00:16,071 --> 01:00:19,532
-What did you tell them that for?
-I don't know. I just. . .

919
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:24,412
I wanted to give them something to
look forward to, to keep their spirits up.

920
01:00:24,997 --> 01:00:26,038
Look at them.

921
01:00:27,082 --> 01:00:31,085
They're terminal. Every last one of them.

922
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:37,466
-Jeez.
-Yeah, and all they wanted to do

923
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:39,385
before they bit the dust
was play Battle of the Bands.

924
01:00:41,263 --> 01:00:42,722
What do they all have?

925
01:00:44,016 --> 01:00:46,309
It's a. . .

926
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:51,397
It's a rare blood disease.
"Stick-it-to-da-man-niosis".

927
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:54,900
What's that? I've never heard of it.

928
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:58,112
You're lucky. Because it's hell.

929
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:00,364
Wow.

930
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:13,502
-We're on the bill.
-Yes!

931
01:01:14,129 --> 01:01:16,964
Cut it out! You're dying, remember?

932
01:01:19,134 --> 01:01:20,259
Get in the van.

933
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:39,195
We come from the land
of the ice and snow

934
01:01:39,279 --> 01:01:42,114
From the midnight sun
where the hot springs blow

935
01:01:42,282 --> 01:01:44,575
Hammer of the gods

936
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:48,245
Summer, you get an A-plus
and 50 gold stars.

937
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:51,999
-I didn't do it for the grade.
-Give me some of that.

938
01:01:52,167 --> 01:01:54,585
Yeah ! Yeah !

939
01:02:03,595 --> 01:02:06,013
And it was so scary.

940
01:02:19,194 --> 01:02:21,278
Hey, Mr S?

941
01:02:21,363 --> 01:02:22,405
We have a name for the band.

942
01:02:23,657 --> 01:02:24,698
Hit me.

943
01:02:29,246 --> 01:02:37,002
The School of Rock.

944
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:46,053
And we shall teach
rock 'n' roll to the world.

945
01:02:46,221 --> 01:02:51,851
There's no way you can stop

946
01:02:52,269 --> 01:02:56,856
The School of Rock
Yeah

947
01:02:57,441 --> 01:02:59,859
Stop. We have a red alert. It's Mullins.

948
01:03:00,068 --> 01:03:02,194
Let's go. Come on.

949
01:03:02,446 --> 01:03:05,573
To your positions. To your positions!

950
01:03:08,952 --> 01:03:11,078
Come on, come on.

951
01:03:18,587 --> 01:03:24,049
And therefore E equals mc-squared.

952
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:26,010
Oh, Miss Mullins. Come in.

953
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:29,972
I'm sorry to interrupt, but
Miss Lemmons said she heard music

954
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:32,808
coming from the classroom.

955
01:03:32,893 --> 01:03:34,268
Music?

956
01:03:35,562 --> 01:03:38,439
Music. I haven't heard any music.

957
01:03:38,607 --> 01:03:42,443
You know what? Miss Lemmons
must be on crack, right, kids?

958
01:03:44,112 --> 01:03:47,907
Well. . . Well, what's that?

959
01:03:52,537 --> 01:03:54,914
Oh, that. Yeah.

960
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:57,917
We were singing.
We were singing and learning.

961
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:01,921
We were learning in sing-song.

962
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:06,133
-One of your methods?
-Yeah.

963
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:09,428
I find it's helpful
when you're teaching the subjects

964
01:04:09,596 --> 01:04:11,931
that are the boring subjects.

965
01:04:14,476 --> 01:04:20,940
Well, you don't mind if I just sit in
on your class this afternoon, do you?

966
01:04:21,149 --> 01:04:23,817
No. No. Come on back this afternoon.

967
01:04:23,944 --> 01:04:26,153
It is the afternoon. I meant now.

968
01:04:28,073 --> 01:04:32,743
So please just continue
with your method.

969
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:36,247
Yeah. Okay.

970
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:56,308
Math is a wonderful thing

971
01:04:57,561 --> 01:05:01,480
Math is a really cool thing

972
01:05:01,982 --> 01:05:04,358
So get off your "ath"
Let's do some math

973
01:05:04,526 --> 01:05:07,903
Math, math, math, math, math

974
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:13,409
Three minus four is...

975
01:05:13,493 --> 01:05:14,535
Negative one.

976
01:05:14,703 --> 01:05:16,203
That's right.

977
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:21,709
And six times a billion is...

978
01:05:23,503 --> 01:05:26,005
-Six billion?
-Nailed it.

979
01:05:26,214 --> 01:05:31,010
And 54 is 45 more than...
What is the answer, Marta?

980
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:32,177
Nine.

981
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:34,847
No, it's eight

982
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:39,351
No, it's nine

983
01:05:40,604 --> 01:05:46,233
Yes, I was testing you
It's nine

984
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:50,029
And that's a magic number

985
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:56,243
I'm very happy that you're able
to extend your stay,

986
01:05:56,411 --> 01:06:02,333
but I must say I find your methods
of teaching very unusual.

987
01:06:02,459 --> 01:06:07,046
Well, I did study with
Dr Errol Von Straussenburgerbecken.

988
01:06:07,547 --> 01:06:09,965
-Who?
-Oh, you don't know him?

989
01:06:10,133 --> 01:06:16,430
Oh, he's, like, one of the leading
leaders in unusual methods.

990
01:06:16,598 --> 01:06:20,768
Actually, he's how I was appointed
to the Presidential Council

991
01:06:21,019 --> 01:06:23,687
for Experimental Educationers.

992
01:06:23,897 --> 01:06:25,564
That sounds very impressive,

993
01:06:25,732 --> 01:06:29,902
but we're not interested
in experimental education here.

994
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:35,616
So if from now on you could just stick
to the curriculum, that would be great.

995
01:06:35,784 --> 01:06:38,285
-Yes. Right.
-Thank you.

996
01:06:38,703 --> 01:06:39,870
Ros?

997
01:06:40,914 --> 01:06:42,623
-Yes?
-Do you know,

998
01:06:42,791 --> 01:06:47,795
I would really love to talk some more
about your philosophy on teaching.

999
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:50,798
Do you think maybe
we could grab some coffee?

1000
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,133
You want to go
get some coffee with me?

1001
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:55,010
I really would.

1002
01:07:01,893 --> 01:07:06,814
-You're sure you don't have coffee?
-I'm quite sure.

1003
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:12,986
Well, I've never been here before.

1004
01:07:15,115 --> 01:07:18,951
I've never been
to this side of town before, in fact.

1005
01:07:19,828 --> 01:07:22,287
So I have been. . .

1006
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:27,876
Well, I've been. . . I've been dying
to ask you something, Mr Schneebly.

1007
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:31,839
-Please, call me Dewey.
-Dewey?

1008
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:35,676
Ned. Call me Ned.

1009
01:07:35,844 --> 01:07:39,638
I was thinking of my other name.
My middle name.

1010
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:43,642
-Yeah.
-Well, Ned,

1011
01:07:46,688 --> 01:07:49,815
in your experience,
how does Horace Green compare

1012
01:07:49,983 --> 01:07:52,484
to the other schools
that you've taught at?

1013
01:07:52,652 --> 01:07:54,653
Oh, your school is the best.

1014
01:07:55,363 --> 01:07:57,489
-You're just saying that.
-I'm not.

1015
01:07:57,657 --> 01:08:01,160
You know that kids at other schools
just have fun all the time?

1016
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:05,497
They run around. There's no discipline.
They're happy. It's anarchy.

1017
01:08:05,665 --> 01:08:09,501
This is the best school
I have ever teached at. I swear.

1018
01:08:10,378 --> 01:08:12,379
I'll drink to that.

1019
01:08:18,678 --> 01:08:21,054
Stay there.
I'm gonna put on some music.

1020
01:08:58,426 --> 01:09:01,011
-I love this song.
-Really?

1021
01:09:01,179 --> 01:09:03,722
-Yes. Stevie Nicks.
-Yeah.

1022
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:05,432
Stevie!

1023
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:08,811
You know, she came to town
and she did a concert

1024
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:13,732
-and she was just so wild.
-I know. Oh, man.

1025
01:09:13,858 --> 01:09:16,777
-Oh, my gosh.
-She put on the best show ever.

1026
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:20,906
She's better live
than she is on the album.

1027
01:09:21,241 --> 01:09:23,408
-You know what I mean?
-Yes, yes.

1028
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:25,536
-Oh, my gosh, no comparison.
-Yeah.

1029
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:28,789
You know what?

1030
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:32,251
Oh, man, I would love
to take the kids to a concert.

1031
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:33,794
-Concert?
-Yeah.

1032
01:09:34,462 --> 01:09:36,839
There's one at the end of the month.

1033
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:41,593
The Philharmonic. They do classics.
They do Beethoven, Mozart,

1034
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:44,596
Enya, that kind of stuff.

1035
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:49,768
But you have a policy about field trips.

1036
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:54,106
-Would it be educational?
-Would it be educational?

1037
01:09:54,274 --> 01:09:55,607
It could be very educational.

1038
01:09:55,692 --> 01:09:57,276
Seventeen

1039
01:09:59,821 --> 01:10:02,114
-Maybe we can make an exception.
-Yes!

1040
01:10:02,282 --> 01:10:05,075
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singing

1041
01:10:08,413 --> 01:10:10,664
I'm holding you to that.

1042
01:10:10,832 --> 01:10:12,624
Make an exception.

1043
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:23,260
Tomorrow

1044
01:10:23,803 --> 01:10:30,100
Keeping your head over water
Making a wave if you can't

1045
01:10:30,268 --> 01:10:33,478
Temporary layoff
Good time

1046
01:10:33,646 --> 01:10:36,857
Easy credit rip-off
Good time

1047
01:10:37,317 --> 01:10:40,861
Scratching and surviving
Good time

1048
01:10:41,529 --> 01:10:43,655
Would you stop that, please?

1049
01:10:43,823 --> 01:10:45,240
Yeah.

1050
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:51,246
-I had a really nice time.
-Yeah, ditto.

1051
01:10:51,414 --> 01:10:54,249
This is the first time
a teacher has asked me

1052
01:10:54,334 --> 01:10:56,251
to do anything outside of school.

1053
01:10:56,419 --> 01:10:59,296
-No way.
-It's. . . It's true.

1054
01:11:00,465 --> 01:11:03,300
In six years.

1055
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:07,220
Well, you know,

1056
01:11:07,347 --> 01:11:10,557
I think it might be one of those things
where people are intimidated.

1057
01:11:11,559 --> 01:11:14,227
Intimidated?

1058
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:16,271
-They hate me.
-No. They don't.

1059
01:11:16,356 --> 01:11:19,191
Yes, they do. They sure do. I can see.

1060
01:11:19,567 --> 01:11:21,485
I wasn't always like this.

1061
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:25,572
I wasn't always wound this tight.
There was a time when I was fun.

1062
01:11:25,907 --> 01:11:29,034
I was funny. I was.

1063
01:11:29,202 --> 01:11:35,582
But you can't be funny
and be the principal of a prep school.

1064
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:38,919
No, you cannot,
because when it comes to their kids,

1065
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:42,130
these parents,
they have no sense of humour.

1066
01:11:42,924 --> 01:11:47,719
If anything goes wrong, it's my head.
It's my head in the smasher.

1067
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:52,224
These parents will come down on me
like a nuclear bomb.

1068
01:11:52,392 --> 01:11:55,519
I can't make a mistake.
I gotta be perfect.

1069
01:11:55,603 --> 01:12:01,233
And that pressure has turned me into
one thing that I never wanted to be.

1070
01:12:02,402 --> 01:12:04,319
A bitch.

1071
01:12:04,487 --> 01:12:08,407
-No. You're not.
-Yes, I am. I am a big one.

1072
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:13,537
Well, I don't think so.
I think you're pretty cool.

1073
01:12:14,789 --> 01:12:16,123
Really?

1074
01:12:16,624 --> 01:12:20,168
-No.
-Yeah. You're way cool.

1075
01:12:20,586 --> 01:12:21,753
Really?

1076
01:12:26,217 --> 01:12:28,427
-Okay, drums?
-House.

1077
01:12:28,636 --> 01:12:30,762
-Keyboards?
-House.

1078
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:34,141
-Amps? All right. Cable?
-Got them.

1079
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:35,809
-All right. Guitar?
-Yes.

1080
01:12:35,977 --> 01:12:37,019
-Mr S.
-Yeah?

1081
01:12:37,103 --> 01:12:38,103
What do you think?

1082
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:48,530
I don't know. l. . .

1083
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:51,241
They might be a little distracting.

1084
01:12:51,409 --> 01:12:55,120
It's glitter rock and it's glam
and it's fabulous.

1085
01:12:56,664 --> 01:12:59,041
Billy, it's just not the right style.

1086
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:01,418
You're gonna talk to me about style?

1087
01:13:01,502 --> 01:13:04,129
You can't dress yourself.
Look at that bow tie.

1088
01:13:04,464 --> 01:13:06,256
Don't talk about my bow tie.

1089
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:10,135
You know what, I give up.
They can just wear their uniforms.

1090
01:13:10,845 --> 01:13:15,015
-That's not a bad idea.
-Not a bad idea?

1091
01:13:15,183 --> 01:13:17,809
-I was kidding.
-Excuse me.

1092
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:22,856
-Hey, hey. What is that?
-What's what?

1093
01:13:23,024 --> 01:13:25,150
-What are you playing?
-Just something I wrote.

1094
01:13:26,486 --> 01:13:27,861
You wrote a song?

1095
01:13:29,447 --> 01:13:32,866
-Well, let's hear it.
-No, it's not that good.

1096
01:13:33,201 --> 01:13:36,328
Come on, I want to hear it, Kurt Cobain.

1097
01:13:37,163 --> 01:13:40,165
-Okay, but I'm not much of a singer.
-It's all right.

1098
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:45,837
Baby, we were making straight A's

1099
01:13:46,005 --> 01:13:49,007
But we were stuck in a dumb daze

1100
01:13:49,634 --> 01:13:53,095
Don't take much to memorise your lies

1101
01:13:53,179 --> 01:13:55,388
Feel like I've been hypnotised

1102
01:13:55,515 --> 01:14:00,268
Wait. You wrote that?
You wrote that?

1103
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:03,313
That's it. Guys, rock 'n' roll positions.

1104
01:14:03,481 --> 01:14:06,399
-What are you doing?
-We're gonna learn your song.

1105
01:14:06,526 --> 01:14:08,944
-But why?
-That's what bands do, man.

1106
01:14:09,195 --> 01:14:11,029
Play each other's songs. You got lyrics?

1107
01:14:12,365 --> 01:14:14,074
Hook me up.

1108
01:14:15,785 --> 01:14:17,369
No more secret songs.

1109
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:21,832
All right, Lawrence, no more reading.
Time for rock.

1110
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:24,543
Get on the drum. Bass it up.

1111
01:14:24,752 --> 01:14:26,294
-What was that chord?
-D.

1112
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:28,296
-Play it.
-D. . .

1113
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:33,176
. . .C, G, C.

1114
01:14:33,344 --> 01:14:35,595
Baby, we were making straight A's

1115
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:37,097
Yeah. Yeah.

1116
01:14:37,265 --> 01:14:40,267
But we were stuck in a dumb daze

1117
01:14:40,434 --> 01:14:42,978
Don't take much to memorise your lies

1118
01:14:43,146 --> 01:14:46,731
And if you wanna be the teacher's pet

1119
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:49,943
Baby, you just better forget it

1120
01:14:50,111 --> 01:14:52,988
Rock is the reason
Rock is the rhyme

1121
01:14:53,156 --> 01:14:55,490
Know what would be better?

1122
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:58,285
"Rock got no reason,
rock got no rhyme."

1123
01:14:58,452 --> 01:15:01,079
Can we try that? Also,
we need some "Ooh la-las", so like. . .

1124
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:06,251
Try that.
Can we take it from the chorus?

1125
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:09,004
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three.

1126
01:15:09,297 --> 01:15:12,757
And if you wanna be the teacher's pet

1127
01:15:12,925 --> 01:15:16,011
Baby, you just better forget it

1128
01:15:16,179 --> 01:15:19,306
Rock got no reason
Rock got no rhyme

1129
01:15:19,974 --> 01:15:26,021
You'd better get me to school on time
And if you wanna be the teacher's pet

1130
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:29,274
Baby, you just better forget it

1131
01:15:29,442 --> 01:15:33,278
Rock got no reason
Rock got no rhyme

1132
01:15:33,446 --> 01:15:37,157
You better get me to school on time

1133
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:47,959
I'm gonna solo there if it's cool with you.

1134
01:15:48,127 --> 01:15:50,128
-All right.
-You can solo later.

1135
01:15:50,296 --> 01:15:53,506
-Okay.
-Let me rock a solo there. I can feel it.

1136
01:16:03,809 --> 01:16:06,728
Tomorrow is the big day,
so get your rest.

1137
01:16:06,812 --> 01:16:10,232
No late parties, drinking tequila
and trying to get lucky.

1138
01:16:11,776 --> 01:16:14,819
Chances like this
do not come around every day.

1139
01:16:15,321 --> 01:16:16,988
You've played hard in here,

1140
01:16:17,156 --> 01:16:20,867
and I am proud
of every last stinking one of you.

1141
01:16:21,744 --> 01:16:23,620
Let's just give this everything we got.

1142
01:16:23,704 --> 01:16:28,416
We may fall on our faces,
but if we do, we will fall with dignity!

1143
01:16:29,001 --> 01:16:31,836
With a guitar in our hands
and rock in our hearts!

1144
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:34,047
And in the words of AC/DC,

1145
01:16:34,215 --> 01:16:37,926
"We roll tonight to the guitar bite,

1146
01:16:38,094 --> 01:16:41,513
"and for those about to rock,

1147
01:16:41,722 --> 01:16:43,682
"I salute you."

1148
01:16:57,863 --> 01:17:01,741
Ros, excuse me. Wanted to remind you
about our field trip tomorrow.

1149
01:17:01,909 --> 01:17:05,537
-What field trip?
-The educational concert.

1150
01:17:05,746 --> 01:17:08,206
Oh, I forgot about that.

1151
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:12,294
I don't know, school policy
is very difficult to get around.

1152
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:15,088
But you said
we could make an exception,

1153
01:17:15,256 --> 01:17:18,174
and the kids are excited
about hearing some Mozart.

1154
01:17:18,342 --> 01:17:22,887
I know, but the preparations,
there's not enough time.

1155
01:17:23,139 --> 01:17:25,307
I don't know anything about it.
Where is it?

1156
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:30,312
I've got it all covered.
What's going on? Are you mad at me?

1157
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:33,815
No, no, Ned.
I'm sorry, I'm just a little stressed out

1158
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:35,942
because it's Parents' Night tonight.

1159
01:17:36,277 --> 01:17:40,363
Hey, it's all gonna be fine.

1160
01:17:44,076 --> 01:17:48,955
Ned, would you mind coming with me
tonight to Parents' Night?

1161
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:52,167
It wouldn't be a date or anything.

1162
01:17:52,335 --> 01:17:54,336
I get nervous around the parents,

1163
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:58,214
and there's something about you
that makes me feel more relaxed.

1164
01:17:58,382 --> 01:18:01,134
You know what,
that sounds so great, Ros, but. . .

1165
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:06,973
-But what?
-I wasn't planning on going tonight.

1166
01:18:07,183 --> 01:18:10,935
You have to. You're their teacher.
You have to give the presentation.

1167
01:18:11,604 --> 01:18:15,315
Oh, yeah, yeah. No, I got you.
I'm ready for that.

1168
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:16,900
So we'll go together?

1169
01:18:17,568 --> 01:18:22,322
Okay. Why don't you pick me up
at, say, 6:40?

1170
01:18:22,490 --> 01:18:25,116
-Done. All right.
-Okay.

1171
01:18:31,749 --> 01:18:36,961
-What are you all dressed up for?
-I got a hot date.

1172
01:18:37,213 --> 01:18:38,755
That's weird.

1173
01:18:38,964 --> 01:18:42,425
I got a cheque
from Horace Green Prep for $1 ,200.

1174
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:44,594
I've never worked there.

1175
01:18:47,473 --> 01:18:50,975
-What are you doing?
-Calling the school.

1176
01:18:52,353 --> 01:18:54,771
Hi, this is Ned Schneebly. . .

1177
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:00,360
Dewey?

1178
01:19:00,528 --> 01:19:01,986
What's going on?

1179
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:04,989
I told them 1 5 times,
make it out to cash !

1180
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:08,201
Dewey?

1181
01:19:08,994 --> 01:19:10,995
I did something bad, Ned.

1182
01:19:11,455 --> 01:19:13,331
-No.
-Yeah.

1183
01:19:13,499 --> 01:19:16,960
They called for a sub.
I said I was you to make some money.

1184
01:19:17,086 --> 01:19:20,338
But then I got there,
and the kids, they rock, man.

1185
01:19:20,506 --> 01:19:24,509
There's this kid Larry who's like,
"I'm not cool," but now he's like. . .

1186
01:19:26,345 --> 01:19:28,346
There's this other girl
who can sing like. . .

1187
01:19:29,181 --> 01:19:33,852
She thought she was too fat, so they
were dying, and the principal got drunk.

1188
01:19:34,019 --> 01:19:37,856
Now we're playing Battle of the Bands.
It's the coolest thing !

1189
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:40,233
One day. Then I will come clean.

1190
01:19:40,401 --> 01:19:44,487
I'll tell everyone it was my fault.
You'll be fine. One day!

1191
01:19:44,655 --> 01:19:46,197
-Ned, home.
-Don't say anything to her.

1192
01:19:46,365 --> 01:19:48,950
She'll blow everything. Please?

1193
01:19:53,539 --> 01:19:56,332
Hey. What's going on?

1194
01:19:57,126 --> 01:20:00,670
Nothing. I got a hot date,
that's what's going on.

1195
01:20:03,382 --> 01:20:05,258
See you later.

1196
01:20:11,474 --> 01:20:13,266
What's going on, Ned?

1197
01:20:14,935 --> 01:20:17,604
-Nothing.
-Nothing? Well. . .

1198
01:20:32,745 --> 01:20:36,581
Okay, I don't think I can go in there.

1199
01:20:37,708 --> 01:20:40,293
-What's wrong?
-Ros,

1200
01:20:41,754 --> 01:20:43,379
I'm not a teacher.

1201
01:20:44,423 --> 01:20:48,051
Oh, Ned. A substitute is a teacher.

1202
01:20:48,177 --> 01:20:51,763
No, no. I'm not a teacher. I'm a fraud.

1203
01:20:51,972 --> 01:20:54,516
No. You're not.

1204
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:59,521
You're a dedicated, talented teacher
and those parents are gonna love you.

1205
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:04,442
Just get in there and tell those parents
what you've been teaching their kids.

1206
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:08,154
Yeah, you know, math, English. . .

1207
01:21:09,657 --> 01:21:12,116
What. . . Science. What else?

1208
01:21:12,284 --> 01:21:17,330
Geography, history,
Latin, Spanish, French.

1209
01:21:17,998 --> 01:21:22,210
Latin. . . Math.
Did I say that already?

1210
01:21:22,378 --> 01:21:28,299
Anyway, all the stuff you want your kids
to know, it's been covered, okay?

1211
01:21:28,425 --> 01:21:30,301
So,

1212
01:21:31,971 --> 01:21:35,765
it was great to meet you all,
and drive safe.

1213
01:21:35,933 --> 01:21:37,350
Excuse me.

1214
01:21:37,476 --> 01:21:40,311
Since you started,
all my son talks about is music.

1215
01:21:40,396 --> 01:21:44,524
He says he wants to be a musician.
ls this your influence?

1216
01:21:44,942 --> 01:21:48,194
Why has my daughter
become obsessed with David Geffen?

1217
01:21:48,279 --> 01:21:50,113
And how is this homework?

1218
01:21:50,447 --> 01:21:54,993
Okay, see, I would like to tell you
about what we've been doing in here,

1219
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:59,038
but there's such a thing
as teacher-student confidentiality,

1220
01:21:59,206 --> 01:22:02,208
and I don't want to be
in breach of educational law

1221
01:22:02,376 --> 01:22:06,462
'cause I could be dismembered
by the teachers' union.

1222
01:22:06,630 --> 01:22:07,672
So. . .

1223
01:22:08,132 --> 01:22:09,507
You expect us to believe this garbage?

1224
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:15,555
Mr S, don't you think
you should tell them about the project?

1225
01:22:15,723 --> 01:22:17,974
-What project?
-Our class project.

1226
01:22:18,183 --> 01:22:19,767
Every school in the state is competing.

1227
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:23,062
-Competing?
-It's not till next quarter,

1228
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:25,523
but Mr S wanted us to get a head start.

1229
01:22:25,691 --> 01:22:28,943
-Well, what's the project, Summer?
-It's prestigious.

1230
01:22:29,153 --> 01:22:31,404
A win will go on our permanent record.

1231
01:22:33,616 --> 01:22:35,992
You might as well tell them,
Mr Schneebly.

1232
01:22:36,201 --> 01:22:41,247
Okay, look. I've gotten to know your kids
the past few weeks. They're awesome.

1233
01:22:41,415 --> 01:22:45,668
Zack is an insane guitarist.
He's the next Hendrix, and he's 1 0.

1234
01:22:45,836 --> 01:22:48,004
And Gordon here, he's a genius!

1235
01:22:48,213 --> 01:22:52,759
He did a whole professional light show
on his computer in three days. And. . .

1236
01:22:53,594 --> 01:22:55,887
And Marta here, she's. . .

1237
01:22:56,096 --> 01:22:58,890
She can hit an A above high C.
Did you know that?

1238
01:22:59,099 --> 01:23:02,560
Because that's tough.
Not many singers can do that. And. . .

1239
01:23:05,272 --> 01:23:09,567
Summer is gonna be the first
woman president of the United States.

1240
01:23:09,735 --> 01:23:12,111
She could run this year.
I would vote for her.

1241
01:23:12,571 --> 01:23:17,408
Look, they're just really cool kids.
If they were mine, I would be so proud.

1242
01:23:17,576 --> 01:23:21,621
And I am proud,
just to even know them. And. . .

1243
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:24,791
Sir, can I see you in the hall
for a moment?

1244
01:23:25,334 --> 01:23:27,627
Let me just say a couple more things.

1245
01:23:27,795 --> 01:23:30,129
-What's going on?
-What's happening?

1246
01:23:30,297 --> 01:23:33,299
Apparently that man
is not Ned Schneebly.

1247
01:23:33,634 --> 01:23:35,802
-What?
-What?

1248
01:23:35,928 --> 01:23:39,097
-This man is Ned Schneebly.
-He's not even a teacher.

1249
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:43,267
-You called the cops?
-She did. She got it out of me. Sorry.

1250
01:23:43,435 --> 01:23:46,938
-You're apologising to him?
-Sorry.

1251
01:23:48,482 --> 01:23:50,149
Ned.

1252
01:23:51,652 --> 01:23:54,112
Ned, is this true?

1253
01:23:54,947 --> 01:23:56,322
Who are you?

1254
01:23:58,283 --> 01:24:00,618
My name is Dewey Finn.

1255
01:24:00,786 --> 01:24:06,165
And, no, I'm not a licensed teacher,
but I have been touched by your kids.

1256
01:24:06,333 --> 01:24:09,043
And I'm pretty sure I've touched them.

1257
01:24:15,968 --> 01:24:17,802
-What?
-Oh, my God.

1258
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:36,904
-I have nothing to say to you.
-Me either.

1259
01:24:38,282 --> 01:24:40,867
Okay. I'm going to bed.

1260
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:43,327
It's one thing to throw your life away,

1261
01:24:43,495 --> 01:24:45,997
but to put Ned in jeopardy is selfish.

1262
01:24:46,165 --> 01:24:48,583
You told me to be like Ned
and get a job.

1263
01:24:48,667 --> 01:24:52,170
I told you to be like Ned.
I didn't tell you to be Ned.

1264
01:24:52,421 --> 01:24:56,340
-You're not gonna apologise?
-You apologise for calling the cops.

1265
01:24:56,508 --> 01:24:59,594
I didn't murder anybody.
I wanted to play a great show.

1266
01:24:59,678 --> 01:25:03,139
-I was this close.
-Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

1267
01:25:03,682 --> 01:25:06,601
Would you both just cut it out
for one second?

1268
01:25:13,859 --> 01:25:17,153
Look, I'm sorry, dude. I was desperate.

1269
01:25:17,738 --> 01:25:20,281
It was easy for you to give up music.

1270
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:23,910
-It ain't easy for me.
-It wasn't easy for me.

1271
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:25,536
I miss it.

1272
01:25:25,704 --> 01:25:27,830
Well, then, why did you give it up?

1273
01:25:27,998 --> 01:25:30,124
Because I couldn't keep
kidding myself any more.

1274
01:25:31,043 --> 01:25:33,544
You can blame it all on bad luck,
but in the end,

1275
01:25:34,213 --> 01:25:36,589
maybe we just weren't that good.

1276
01:25:37,257 --> 01:25:39,634
Sometimes you gotta know when to quit.

1277
01:25:40,052 --> 01:25:42,887
-Right, maybe I suck.
-That's not what I said.

1278
01:25:43,013 --> 01:25:46,891
Well, music is my life, man.
What do you want me to do?

1279
01:25:47,768 --> 01:25:50,269
I don't know, but

1280
01:25:51,146 --> 01:25:53,564
I think it's time you moved out.

1281
01:25:54,775 --> 01:25:56,359
Sorry.

1282
01:26:04,952 --> 01:26:10,081
-So his name wasn't Mr Schneebly?
-No, it was, like, Dewey something.

1283
01:26:11,041 --> 01:26:12,667
What about the project?

1284
01:26:12,751 --> 01:26:15,086
Wake up, Marco. There was no project.

1285
01:26:15,295 --> 01:26:18,422
He wanted us to play a show
so we could make money.

1286
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:20,800
I can't believe we weren't graded.

1287
01:26:20,968 --> 01:26:23,886
Why are you bummed?
We had a three-week vacation.

1288
01:26:24,221 --> 01:26:27,306
It was a waste of time,
but it was better than school.

1289
01:26:27,474 --> 01:26:31,644
-It was not a waste of time.
-Yeah, that's what it was.

1290
01:26:31,812 --> 01:26:33,479
-You're an idiot.
-Shut up.

1291
01:26:33,647 --> 01:26:35,815
-No, you shut up.
-You want to go?

1292
01:26:35,983 --> 01:26:38,943
Touch him, I'll shove those sticks
down your throat.

1293
01:26:39,111 --> 01:26:42,947
Mr S was cool. We worked too long
and too hard not to play the show.

1294
01:26:44,241 --> 01:26:46,325
Okay, so what are we supposed to do?

1295
01:26:46,493 --> 01:26:48,870
We get out of here
and play the damn show.

1296
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:52,290
How could you let our children
be exposed to this impostor?

1297
01:26:52,457 --> 01:26:56,669
-Do you just let anyone teach here?
-I pay $1 5,000. . .

1298
01:26:56,837 --> 01:27:01,132
Let me assure you
that nothing is more important to us

1299
01:27:01,341 --> 01:27:05,511
than for you to feel your children
are in a safe and secure environment.

1300
01:27:18,150 --> 01:27:20,818
-Okay, we're all here.
-Where's Mr Schneebly?

1301
01:27:20,986 --> 01:27:24,530
He didn't tell you? He's at home.
We need to pick him up.

1302
01:27:24,698 --> 01:27:26,282
Let's go. Hurry.

1303
01:27:32,372 --> 01:27:36,584
Excuse me. Just one second, please.

1304
01:27:37,169 --> 01:27:40,129
-Excuse me.
-Wait a minute. Where are you going?

1305
01:27:40,297 --> 01:27:43,925
-We want some answers now!
-Just one second !

1306
01:28:00,192 --> 01:28:05,196
Where did they go? Help! Children?

1307
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:09,325
Wake up.

1308
01:28:17,376 --> 01:28:21,337
-How did you guys get in here?
-Front door was open.

1309
01:28:22,381 --> 01:28:24,048
Why aren't you in school?

1310
01:28:24,216 --> 01:28:26,384
We did what you said.
We stuck it to The Man.

1311
01:28:26,927 --> 01:28:30,346
Forget about what I told you.
Look, I'm a loser, okay?

1312
01:28:30,555 --> 01:28:33,391
You listen to my advice,
you'll end up like me, with nothing.

1313
01:28:34,935 --> 01:28:38,396
Come on, man, quit goofing around.
This is serious business.

1314
01:28:38,563 --> 01:28:41,774
We're on a mission.
One great show can change the world.

1315
01:28:44,361 --> 01:28:45,403
Look out the window.

1316
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:57,081
-Mr S! Come down !
-Come on !

1317
01:28:57,249 --> 01:29:00,793
No way. That is so punk rock.

1318
01:29:04,631 --> 01:29:08,926
The dining room table seats 1 4,
with no inserts. . .

1319
01:29:14,766 --> 01:29:18,144
-What's going on?
-We've got some rocking to do.

1320
01:29:30,949 --> 01:29:32,742
-Yes!
-All right.

1321
01:29:32,868 --> 01:29:35,953
-Hi, Mr Schneebly.
-How's it going?

1322
01:29:37,956 --> 01:29:43,169
You guys, all I can say is, let's rock.

1323
01:29:45,338 --> 01:29:49,633
One more thing.
I want to say I'm sorry

1324
01:29:50,802 --> 01:29:53,095
that I used you guys.

1325
01:29:55,182 --> 01:29:57,141
I'm sorry I lied.

1326
01:29:57,350 --> 01:30:00,019
-It's not cool to lie to your band.
-Come on.

1327
01:30:00,187 --> 01:30:03,355
We'll be late.
There's no time for apologies. Let's go!

1328
01:30:03,482 --> 01:30:05,107
All right. Let's go.

1329
01:30:06,193 --> 01:30:08,903
-Where are you going?
-I'm going to the show.

1330
01:30:09,071 --> 01:30:11,363
-You want to go?
-Yeah, I want to go.

1331
01:30:11,490 --> 01:30:14,492
-Are you serious?
-I don't want to miss this, Patty.

1332
01:30:14,701 --> 01:30:17,828
Unbelievable.
After everything he's done to you?

1333
01:30:17,996 --> 01:30:21,582
That is so typical Ned.
When will you stop being a pushover?

1334
01:30:21,708 --> 01:30:25,252
When are you finally gonna start
sticking up for yourself?

1335
01:30:30,342 --> 01:30:35,638
Excuse me.

1336
01:30:35,847 --> 01:30:39,391
I've just been informed
that all of your children are missing.

1337
01:30:41,144 --> 01:30:43,729
-So. . .
-What?

1338
01:31:04,251 --> 01:31:05,876
-Hey.
-Can I help you?

1339
01:31:06,044 --> 01:31:08,379
We're competing.
We're the School of Rock.

1340
01:31:08,547 --> 01:31:11,173
-You and the kids?
-We're the band and crew.

1341
01:31:11,341 --> 01:31:13,467
-You'd better get in here.
-Come on.

1342
01:31:13,635 --> 01:31:16,137
-We're here.
-You're late. You're up next.

1343
01:31:16,304 --> 01:31:19,890
-Okay, we'll be ready. Come on.
-Zack, check this out.

1344
01:31:20,058 --> 01:31:21,600
Whoa, it's awesome.

1345
01:31:21,685 --> 01:31:25,563
Tears I can find on my own

1346
01:31:27,190 --> 01:31:31,861
I'll take you there

1347
01:31:31,987 --> 01:31:33,737
I'll never...

1348
01:31:34,322 --> 01:31:38,784
Don't listen to those hacks. Come on.
Band meeting. Now. Gather round.

1349
01:31:38,952 --> 01:31:41,787
All right. Frankie, how's security?

1350
01:31:41,955 --> 01:31:43,998
-We're set.
-What about the lights?

1351
01:31:44,166 --> 01:31:46,792
Light board's in the balcony.
I'll patch it up.

1352
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:48,586
Billy, how's beautification?

1353
01:31:48,753 --> 01:31:51,505
-Are you kidding?
-Okay, listen up, you guys.

1354
01:31:51,673 --> 01:31:55,092
We only have one song
to let these guys know who we are.

1355
01:31:55,218 --> 01:31:58,220
-So I think we should play Zack's.
-But why?

1356
01:31:58,388 --> 01:32:00,598
-I mean, really?
-Yes.

1357
01:32:00,891 --> 01:32:03,309
The thing is, you guys,
I ain't that good.

1358
01:32:03,476 --> 01:32:07,479
I'm not. I can admit it. But you're 1 0,
and you're better than me.

1359
01:32:07,606 --> 01:32:10,191
Your song rocks harder, so let's play it.

1360
01:32:10,358 --> 01:32:13,152
But you know what?
That's just one guy's opinion.

1361
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:16,488
This ain't my band, it's our band.
We all have a say.

1362
01:32:16,615 --> 01:32:20,618
We haven't practised that one as much.
I mean, we might not win.

1363
01:32:20,827 --> 01:32:24,997
Hey, we didn't come here to win.
We came here to play one great show.

1364
01:32:25,165 --> 01:32:28,334
And on Zack's song,
you guys really rock.

1365
01:32:29,127 --> 01:32:32,129
You know my vote.
Who else is with me?

1366
01:32:32,464 --> 01:32:34,506
All right, let's pray.

1367
01:32:34,633 --> 01:32:38,802
God of rock,
thank you for this chance to kick ass.

1368
01:32:39,763 --> 01:32:42,932
We are your humble servants.
Please give us the power

1369
01:32:43,016 --> 01:32:45,684
to blow minds
with our high-voltage rock.

1370
01:32:45,894 --> 01:32:49,271
-In your name, we pray. Amen.
-Amen.

1371
01:32:49,522 --> 01:32:52,191
Now let's get out there
and melt some faces!

1372
01:32:52,275 --> 01:32:54,443
-Yeah !
-Go get ready.

1373
01:32:54,653 --> 01:32:57,696
-You gotta sing it.
-Are you sure? It's your song.

1374
01:32:58,156 --> 01:33:01,492
-Yeah, it's cool, I'm no singer.
-Okay, I'll sing it.

1375
01:33:01,952 --> 01:33:03,827
-Yeah?
-What about the lights?

1376
01:33:03,995 --> 01:33:06,038
All the cues are to the other song.

1377
01:33:06,206 --> 01:33:09,667
You're just gonna have to feel it.
You gotta improvise.

1378
01:33:09,876 --> 01:33:13,045
You know this song.
I know you can do it.

1379
01:33:13,421 --> 01:33:15,881
-Okay.
-Go. Run like the wind !

1380
01:33:16,049 --> 01:33:18,425
-Hey.
-What's this?

1381
01:33:18,593 --> 01:33:22,805
You wanted to go with the uniform,
so put it on. Quick.

1382
01:33:25,558 --> 01:33:31,188
Hear my heartsick, hungry cry

1383
01:33:32,899 --> 01:33:35,276
I'm heartsick

1384
01:33:35,443 --> 01:33:37,695
So heal me

1385
01:33:37,904 --> 01:33:40,281
I'm heartsick

1386
01:33:40,448 --> 01:33:46,036
I'm hungry
Thought I could survive on you

1387
01:33:46,204 --> 01:33:51,208
Hear my heartsick, hungry cry

1388
01:33:53,670 --> 01:33:55,212
-Slow down.
-My son is. . .

1389
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:58,340
-Where's your ticket?
-My son's in there. He's 1 0.

1390
01:33:58,508 --> 01:34:01,260
You're not going in without a ticket.

1391
01:34:01,428 --> 01:34:04,596
-We're not here for the show.
-We have a situation.

1392
01:34:04,723 --> 01:34:07,641
I'm Rosalie Mullins.
I'm principal of Horace Green.

1393
01:34:07,726 --> 01:34:09,768
We had a field trip that went awry.

1394
01:34:09,853 --> 01:34:12,980
Some lunatic kidnapped our kids.
Our kids are in there.

1395
01:34:13,106 --> 01:34:16,066
You're breaking my heart.
There's the ticket table.

1396
01:34:16,484 --> 01:34:19,737
-Maybe we should just get tickets.
-Let's get tickets!

1397
01:34:20,113 --> 01:34:22,072
-Excuse me.
-My child's up there.

1398
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:24,616
Excuse me, please,
our kids are in here.

1399
01:34:24,743 --> 01:34:27,286
Excuse me, please. Excuse me.

1400
01:34:27,454 --> 01:34:29,079
-Quit pushing !
-Excuse me.

1401
01:34:29,247 --> 01:34:32,041
-Excuse me.
-Hey, stop it.

1402
01:34:35,295 --> 01:34:37,921
Hey. What's up?

1403
01:34:39,257 --> 01:34:40,549
Come on !

1404
01:34:40,717 --> 01:34:42,301
We're the School of Rock.

1405
01:34:42,469 --> 01:34:46,764
And this song was written
by our own Zack Mooneyham.

1406
01:35:23,676 --> 01:35:26,637
Baby, we was making straight A's

1407
01:35:27,764 --> 01:35:31,183
But we were stuck in a dumb daze

1408
01:35:31,351 --> 01:35:35,187
Don't take much to memorise your lies

1409
01:35:35,355 --> 01:35:37,731
I feel like I've been hypnoticised

1410
01:35:37,899 --> 01:35:40,984
And then that magic man
He come to town

1411
01:35:42,195 --> 01:35:44,696
He done spun my head around

1412
01:35:44,823 --> 01:35:48,492
He said, "Recess is in session
Two and two make five"

1413
01:35:49,244 --> 01:35:51,537
And now, baby, oh, I'm alive

1414
01:35:52,205 --> 01:35:55,332
Oh, yeah
I am alive

1415
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:58,210
And if you wanna be the teacher's pet

1416
01:35:59,462 --> 01:36:02,339
Well, baby, you just better forget it

1417
01:36:03,216 --> 01:36:06,760
Rock got no reason
Rock got no rhyme

1418
01:36:06,928 --> 01:36:10,097
You better get me to school on time

1419
01:36:10,557 --> 01:36:11,849
Oh, yeah

1420
01:36:12,058 --> 01:36:13,517
Yeah

1421
01:36:27,198 --> 01:36:30,742
Oh, you know I was on the honour roll

1422
01:36:31,870 --> 01:36:34,663
Got good grades, ain't got no soul

1423
01:36:35,457 --> 01:36:38,959
Raise my hand
before I can speak my mind

1424
01:36:39,169 --> 01:36:41,628
I've been biting my tongue
too many times

1425
01:36:41,796 --> 01:36:45,090
And then that magic man
took you away

1426
01:36:45,508 --> 01:36:48,302
Do what magic man do
Not what magic man say

1427
01:36:48,386 --> 01:36:49,470
Say what?

1428
01:36:49,554 --> 01:36:52,764
Now, can I please have
the attention of the class?

1429
01:36:53,850 --> 01:36:56,226
Today's assignment

1430
01:36:58,396 --> 01:36:59,688
Kick some ass!

1431
01:36:59,856 --> 01:37:02,983
And if you wanna be the teacher's pet

1432
01:37:03,193 --> 01:37:06,153
Well, baby, you just better forget it

1433
01:37:06,863 --> 01:37:10,032
Rock got no reason
Rock got no rhyme

1434
01:37:10,658 --> 01:37:13,285
You better get me to school on time

1435
01:37:13,453 --> 01:37:16,497
And if you wanna be the teacher's pet

1436
01:37:17,207 --> 01:37:20,250
Well, baby, you just better forget it

1437
01:37:20,835 --> 01:37:24,421
Rock got no reason
Rock got no rhyme

1438
01:37:24,589 --> 01:37:28,050
You better get me to school on time

1439
01:37:28,927 --> 01:37:40,145
Oh, yeah

1440
01:37:54,244 --> 01:37:56,495
This is my final exam

1441
01:37:57,747 --> 01:37:59,790
Now y'all know who I am

1442
01:38:00,166 --> 01:38:03,126
I might not be that perfect son

1443
01:38:03,545 --> 01:38:06,088
But y'all be rocking when I'm done

1444
01:38:19,644 --> 01:38:21,979
Your son is very skilled.

1445
01:38:22,188 --> 01:38:24,147
Thanks. So's yours.

1446
01:38:45,503 --> 01:38:47,212
Take me back!

1447
01:38:50,341 --> 01:38:53,594
All right. Yeah !

1448
01:38:55,555 --> 01:38:56,888
Yeah !

1449
01:39:05,189 --> 01:39:06,898
Let's go!

1450
01:39:12,739 --> 01:39:14,031
School of Rock!

1451
01:39:18,745 --> 01:39:21,580
To get in, you gotta be in a band
or have a pass.

1452
01:39:21,748 --> 01:39:24,124
I am principal of the school's band.

1453
01:39:24,334 --> 01:39:25,959
-Oh, right on.
-All right?

1454
01:39:26,127 --> 01:39:29,254
All right? All right? All right?

1455
01:39:29,589 --> 01:39:33,800
That was incredible!
That was incredible.

1456
01:39:33,968 --> 01:39:38,388
Oh, my gosh, the lights
and the guitar solos. . .

1457
01:39:38,556 --> 01:39:41,141
-Was it really you playing?
-You're not mad?

1458
01:39:41,351 --> 01:39:43,769
Mad? I'm furious!

1459
01:39:43,936 --> 01:39:47,272
I'm horrified, but it was incredible.
It was so great.

1460
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:50,859
You guys were so great,
I can't believe it.

1461
01:39:51,027 --> 01:39:54,571
Dude! You did it, man !
Those lights were awesome!

1462
01:39:54,739 --> 01:39:56,406
They were awesome.

1463
01:39:56,574 --> 01:39:58,408
-They're incredible.
-Amazing.

1464
01:39:58,576 --> 01:40:00,452
-Who's the manager?
-I am.

1465
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:03,580
Summer Hathaway. Nice to meet you.

1466
01:40:03,790 --> 01:40:05,415
Nice to meet you.

1467
01:40:05,583 --> 01:40:07,292
Hey, wait. Come here, guys.

1468
01:40:07,460 --> 01:40:09,753
-You guys rock. How old are you?
-Ten.

1469
01:40:09,921 --> 01:40:12,464
Ten? No way, dude.
How long you been playing?

1470
01:40:12,632 --> 01:40:15,801
Three years. I used to play classical,
now I play rock.

1471
01:40:15,968 --> 01:40:17,928
Hey, you in a band?

1472
01:40:18,971 --> 01:40:21,598
No. No.

1473
01:40:21,766 --> 01:40:26,019
No, I am the principal of a school.

1474
01:40:27,313 --> 01:40:30,607
Yeah? Wow, that's cool.

1475
01:40:30,775 --> 01:40:33,193
-That's cool.
-Yes. Yes, it is.

1476
01:40:33,403 --> 01:40:35,654
It's very. . . It's very cool.

1477
01:40:35,822 --> 01:40:38,490
-Yeah. It is cool.
-Yes. It is very cool.

1478
01:40:38,658 --> 01:40:40,325
-I like that.
-Do you? Yes.

1479
01:40:40,493 --> 01:40:42,369
-You're hot. You're so hot.
-What?

1480
01:40:42,453 --> 01:40:43,829
-I'm sorry.
-What?

1481
01:40:44,247 --> 01:40:45,539
Are you warm?

1482
01:40:49,627 --> 01:40:52,629
All right, guys, this is it,
the moment of truth.

1483
01:40:53,131 --> 01:40:56,717
The winner of this year's
Battle of the Bands competition

1484
01:40:58,511 --> 01:41:01,096
is No Vacancy!

1485
01:41:06,102 --> 01:41:08,645
No! Boo!

1486
01:41:09,021 --> 01:41:13,483
It was a beauty contest.
They didn't listen to the music. Boo! No!

1487
01:41:13,651 --> 01:41:15,026
What?

1488
01:41:16,821 --> 01:41:18,155
Oh, no.

1489
01:41:18,364 --> 01:41:20,490
On behalf of the Battle of the Bands,

1490
01:41:20,658 --> 01:41:25,162
I'd like to present this cheque
for $20,000 to No Vacancy.

1491
01:41:25,955 --> 01:41:28,999
Yeah ! No Vacancy!

1492
01:41:29,167 --> 01:41:31,460
-No, School of Rock.
-School of Rock!

1493
01:41:31,586 --> 01:41:35,046
School of Rock!

1494
01:41:35,548 --> 01:41:36,882
What's wrong?

1495
01:41:37,049 --> 01:41:39,885
What's wrong, Summer?
Didn't you hear? We lost.

1496
01:41:39,969 --> 01:41:42,804
Chill out, dude.
Rock isn't about getting an A.

1497
01:41:43,055 --> 01:41:46,933
-Sex Pistols never won anything.
-Don't let The Man get you down.

1498
01:41:47,018 --> 01:41:50,228
Dude, you gotta cheer up.
We played a kick-ass show.

1499
01:41:51,397 --> 01:41:52,981
We did, didn't we?

1500
01:41:53,149 --> 01:41:56,568
-It was unbelievable, wasn't it?
-Yeah.

1501
01:41:56,736 --> 01:42:00,989
School of Rock!
School of Rock! School of Rock!

1502
01:42:11,709 --> 01:42:13,460
-What is that?
-School of Rock!

1503
01:42:13,544 --> 01:42:16,546
-School of Rock!
-It's an encore.

1504
01:42:16,631 --> 01:42:20,217
They want us to go play another song.
It's good ! Go, you guys!

1505
01:42:20,384 --> 01:42:23,053
Wait, no. Just the band.
Okay, everybody, go!

1506
01:42:35,608 --> 01:42:38,735
Thank you. Yes, we will play one more.

01:43:23,239 --> 01:43:25,657
Bye, Mom. See you later.

1512
01:43:26,284 --> 01:43:30,620
I told you, as soon as I talk
to the band, I'll get back to you.

1513
01:43:30,788 --> 01:43:34,165
If you're so desperate,
then quit low-balling us.

1514
01:43:41,674 --> 01:43:44,259
I tell you, people
it's harder than it looks

1515
01:43:44,427 --> 01:43:49,598
'Cause it's a long way to the top
if you wanna rock 'n' roll

1516
01:43:51,517 --> 01:43:56,605
Yes, it's a long way to the top
if you wanna rock 'n' roll

1517
01:43:59,692 --> 01:44:02,986
You think it's easy
playing one-night stands?

1518
01:44:03,154 --> 01:44:05,864
Well, try playing in a rock 'n' roll band

1519
01:44:06,032 --> 01:44:10,702
It's a long way to the top
if you wanna rock 'n' roll

1520
01:44:13,164 --> 01:44:16,499
And that's a C.
All right? You got that?

1521
01:44:16,667 --> 01:44:19,294
Let's see. Okay, Paola, let's see you.

1522
01:44:19,462 --> 01:44:23,048
Yeah, your fingers are basically right.

1523
01:44:23,215 --> 01:44:25,550
DeShawn, what do you got?
All right, play.

1524
01:44:25,718 --> 01:44:29,179
Toby, you got it? Let's see.
Very good, you guys.

I tell you, people
it's harder than it looks

1531
01:44:42,735 --> 01:44:48,657
'Cause it's a long way to the top
if you wanna rock 'n' roll

1532
01:44:50,076 --> 01:44:53,161
All right, now take it down
nice and quiet.

1533
01:44:54,288 --> 01:44:57,165
The next thing I wanna hear

1534
01:44:57,708 --> 01:45:02,545
is a face-melting solo
by our own Zack Mooneyham. Go!

1535
01:45:02,713 --> 01:45:04,381
Here we go!

1536
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:22,232
Dude, is my face okay?
I think you melted it off.

1537
01:45:23,484 --> 01:45:26,486
All right, now the next thing
I wanna hear. . .

1538
01:45:26,696 --> 01:45:30,824
The very next thing. . . I don't wanna
hear anything unless I hear

1539
01:45:32,118 --> 01:45:37,580
a gut-busting drum solo from Freddy.
Take it away!

1540
01:45:48,801 --> 01:45:53,304
It's a long way to the top
if you wanna rock 'n' roll

1541
01:45:55,433 --> 01:46:00,061
Yes, it's a long way to the top
if you wanna rock 'n' roll

1542
01:46:00,813 --> 01:46:02,605
My gut got busted !

1543
01:46:04,108 --> 01:46:05,775
What did you do, Freddy?

1544
01:46:10,656 --> 01:46:15,160
Now I think it's time
we heard from a little somebody.

1545
01:46:17,830 --> 01:46:20,915
Lawrence on lead solo keyboard, go!

1546
01:46:36,140 --> 01:46:39,851
Long way to the top
if you wanna rock 'n' roll

1547
01:46:40,019 --> 01:46:42,979
All right, slow it up. Listen up, you guys.

1548
01:46:43,147 --> 01:46:44,689
Here's what I need.

1549
01:46:44,857 --> 01:46:48,026
I need you girls to repeat after me. . .

1550
01:47:01,707 --> 01:47:03,166
All right.

1551
01:47:03,334 --> 01:47:05,251
Now the first test is over.

1552
01:47:05,836 --> 01:47:12,092
I'm gonna need Alicia to give me
a two-second vocal solo. Here it comes.

1553
01:47:12,259 --> 01:47:17,931
'Cause it's a long way to the top
if you wanna rock 'n' roll

1554
01:47:18,641 --> 01:47:22,602
Don't Bogart the mike, Alicia.
That was beautiful, but now it's time.

1555
01:47:22,812 --> 01:47:24,771
Come on, Tomika, melt it.

1556
01:47:32,154 --> 01:47:33,780
That was tasty.

1557
01:47:34,406 --> 01:47:37,492
Marta, blow my brains out. Go.

1558
01:47:37,660 --> 01:47:41,037

-It's time to go now

1570
01:48:31,589 --> 01:48:33,965
Other people gotta come in
for the next show

1571
01:48:34,133 --> 01:48:35,592
You're getting in the way

1572
01:48:35,801 --> 01:48:38,970
The cleaning guy is coming
to clean up the sticky stuff on the floor

1573
01:48:40,306 --> 01:48:47,145
It's a long way to the top
if you wanna rock 'n' roll

1574
01:48:47,438 --> 01:48:51,983
Yes, it's a long way to the top
if you wanna rock 'n' roll

1575
01:48:52,151 --> 01:48:54,319
All right, that's it.
Stop, you guys, stop.

1576
01:48:55,946 --> 01:48:59,532
Seriously, you guys.
All right, take five.

1577
01:49:01,410 --> 01:49:03,119
Take five.

1578
01:49:03,829 --> 01:49:05,538
You wanna go? All right.

1579
01:49:05,706 --> 01:49:07,999
-That was a good class.
-I'll see you, man.
