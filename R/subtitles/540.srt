00:20:59,622 --> 00:21:03,191
Nobody likes a bashful leatherhead!

383
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:04,359
Move it!

384
00:21:04,427 --> 00:21:06,995
For my first trick...

385
00:21:07,062 --> 00:21:10,265
I'm going to do
something for you, son.

386
00:21:12,935 --> 00:21:14,469
We have...A giraffe!

387
00:21:14,537 --> 00:21:17,839
There ya go, son. Now, get
outta here. You bother me.

388
00:21:17,906 --> 00:21:18,873
Thanks.

389
00:21:18,941 --> 00:21:19,907
Wow!

390
00:21:19,975 --> 00:21:21,109
Now...

391
00:21:22,411 --> 00:21:23,811
Sorry. Wrong pocket.

[Woman] Ha ha ha.

393
00:21:25,314 --> 00:21:27,249
For you, son...

394
00:21:27,316 --> 00:21:29,351
A little body English.

395
00:21:33,088 --> 00:21:35,490
A French poodle.

397
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:37,492
Sorry, son.

398
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,062
The dog was rabid.
Had to put it down.

399
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,031
And last but not least,

400
00:21:43,098 --> 00:21:45,300

401
00:21:55,611 --> 00:21:57,745

403
00:22:09,525 --> 00:22:11,493
This is incredible.

404
00:22:11,561 --> 00:22:12,960
With these powers,

405
00:22:13,028 --> 00:22:15,129
I could be...

406
00:22:17,266 --> 00:22:19,467
A superhero!

407
00:22:19,535 --> 00:22:22,470
I could fight crime,
protect the innocent,

408
00:22:22,538 --> 00:22:25,006
work for world peace!

409
00:22:25,074 --> 00:22:26,841
But first...

[Crash]

411
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:35,517
Hold on to your lug nuts!

412
00:22:35,585 --> 00:22:40,121
It's time for an overhaul!

413
00:22:48,598 --> 00:22:50,031
What's that?

414
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:51,032
Aah!

415
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,467
Ohh!

416
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,894
Ohh.

417
00:23:02,962 --> 00:23:05,964
Ahh.

418
00:23:06,032 --> 00:23:07,398
Ohh.

419
00:23:25,517 --> 00:23:27,285
It was a dream.

420
00:23:27,352 --> 00:23:28,953
Ha ha ha.

421
00:23:29,021 --> 00:23:31,489
It was a dream.

422
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:33,858
Ohh.

423
00:23:35,527 --> 00:23:37,962
I gotta lay off the cartoons.

424
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,630
[Knock on door]

425
00:23:45,537 --> 00:23:47,706
Ipkiss? Stanley Ipkiss?

426
00:23:47,773 --> 00:23:48,840
Yes.

427
00:23:48,908 --> 00:23:50,474
Lieutenant Kellaway.
City precinct.

428
00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:53,945
Do you know anything about
the disturbance last night?

429
00:23:54,013 --> 00:23:56,681
Dis...turbance?

430
00:23:56,749 --> 00:23:58,482
Yeah. A prowler broke in

431
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,984
and attacked Mrs. Peenman.

432
00:24:00,052 --> 00:24:01,519
Attacked?

433
00:24:01,587 --> 00:24:03,054
You didn't hear anything?

434
00:24:03,122 --> 00:24:05,924
She unloaded several
rounds of 20-odd buckshot

435
00:24:05,991 --> 00:24:07,625
5 feet from your door.

436
00:24:07,693 --> 00:24:09,861
Look at the floor! See that?

437
00:24:09,929 --> 00:24:12,430
He put that right in my floor,

438
00:24:12,497 --> 00:24:14,966
then he jumped out
the window, officer!

439
00:24:15,034 --> 00:24:17,435
This is...

440
00:24:17,502 --> 00:24:18,937
Impossible.

441
00:24:19,004 --> 00:24:20,438
Those pajamas are impossible.

442
00:24:20,505 --> 00:24:21,973
This actually happened.

443
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:25,443
Uh, see, I have, uh...

444
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:27,578
An inner ear problem.

445
00:24:29,014 --> 00:24:30,982
Sometimes I can't hear anything.

446
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:32,450
That a fact?

447
00:24:32,517 --> 00:24:33,684
Eh?

448
00:24:34,686 --> 00:24:36,121
Here's my card.

449
00:24:36,188 --> 00:24:39,257
If you remember anything
unusual about last night,

00:24:39,324 --> 00:24:40,992
anything at all,

451
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,493

452
00:24:42,561 --> 00:24:43,995
You betcha. Thank you.

Oh, my God. I'm late!

Keys. Keys.

Where are the keys?

458
00:25:10,489 --> 00:25:11,589
Damn.

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,162
Get 'em. Find 'em.

Ow! Jeez.

I am so late.

Come on, boy.

469
00:25:37,065 --> 00:25:38,500

470
00:25:38,567 --> 00:25:40,168

Easy. Watch the bump!

472
00:26:09,481 --> 00:26:11,416
I want a proctologist standing by.

474
00:26:12,984 --> 00:26:15,953
You heard me. The
best one you can find.

<i>I'm with the evening star.</i>

Can you tell me what happened?

477
00:26:19,491 --> 00:26:21,426
No, and you can quote me.

478
00:26:21,493 --> 00:26:23,428
It looks like a mob tactic.

479
00:26:23,495 --> 00:26:26,431
There it is, boys.
She broke the case.

480
00:26:26,498 --> 00:26:28,433
Get these rubbernecks out of here.

Hey, Stan. Stan, Stan!

Where were you last night?

485
00:26:37,009 --> 00:26:39,977
The girls and I were
looking all over for you.

486
00:26:40,046 --> 00:26:42,847
Did you happen to look
outside... In the gutter?

487
00:26:42,915 --> 00:26:44,449
You check the morning paper?

488
00:26:44,517 --> 00:26:47,485
Your girlfriend got
a great review.

489
00:26:47,553 --> 00:26:49,454
Ipkiss, you're 40 minutes late.

490
00:26:49,522 --> 00:26:51,423
That's the same as stealing.

491
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:52,957
I'm sorry, Mr. dickey.

492
00:26:53,025 --> 00:26:56,194
It'll never happen
again. I've been a...Jerk.

493
00:26:56,262 --> 00:26:59,197
Well, if you weren't busy
oogling girlie pictures,

494
00:26:59,265 --> 00:27:02,167
you might actually get
some work done around here.

495
00:27:02,234 --> 00:27:05,103
Uh, sir, she's a prospective
client of Stanley's.

Oh, really?

497
00:27:08,974 --> 00:27:10,408
Well...

498
00:27:10,476 --> 00:27:12,877
The next time she comes in,

499
00:27:12,945 --> 00:27:16,081
you be sure to send
her to my office.

500
00:27:16,148 --> 00:27:18,416
Oh ho. You betcha.

501
00:27:22,654 --> 00:27:25,590
Gee, I wish my
daddy owned a bank...

502
00:27:25,657 --> 00:27:28,926
Then I could be a
rich little creep, too.

503
00:27:28,994 --> 00:27:31,996
You think she'll ever
come back, Charlie?

504
00:27:32,064 --> 00:27:33,465
Oh, man. Forget her.

505
00:27:33,532 --> 00:27:34,966
Stanley, listen to me.

506
00:27:35,033 --> 00:27:38,336
A girl like that is always
looking for the b.B.D.--

507
00:27:38,404 --> 00:27:39,870
the bigger, better deal.

508
00:27:39,938 --> 00:27:42,474
You don't know that.
She's an artist.

509
00:27:42,541 --> 00:27:43,774
She's sensitive.

510
00:27:43,842 --> 00:27:46,711
Stanley, forget her. That girl
will tear out your heart,

511
00:27:46,778 --> 00:27:50,215
put it in a blender,
and hit "frapee."

512
00:27:50,282 --> 00:27:52,217
You don't need her, man.

513
00:27:52,284 --> 00:27:55,286
You need somebody a
little more down to earth,

514
00:27:55,354 --> 00:27:56,787
somebody with some integrity,

515
00:27:56,855 --> 00:27:57,955
somebody with...

516
00:27:58,023 --> 00:27:59,457
Red hair...

517
00:27:59,525 --> 00:28:01,726
And full pouting lips,

518
00:28:01,793 --> 00:28:04,929
a white blouse, a green
jacket, and a name tag.

519
00:28:04,997 --> 00:28:07,432
Boy, you really narrowed it down.

520
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,001
Too bad she's already taken.

521
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:14,905

be of some assistance?

522

526
00:28:23,482 --> 00:28:25,416
Look, I canceled my subscription

527
00:28:25,484 --> 00:28:28,085
because they kept
stealing my paper from--

528
00:28:28,154 --> 00:28:29,420
oh, no, no.

529
00:28:29,488 --> 00:28:32,423
Actually, I just want to
ask you a few questions.

530
00:28:32,491 --> 00:28:33,824
Really? About what?

theirs, aren't you?

534
00:28:40,032 --> 00:28:41,432
No.

535
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,934
I don't even have a car.

536
00:28:44,002 --> 00:28:45,970
You know, 'cause they...

537
00:28:46,038 --> 00:28:47,539
Pollute.

538
00:28:47,606 --> 00:28:50,175
You don't own an '89 civic?

539
00:28:52,178 --> 00:28:54,479
Oh, that car. Yeah.

540
00:28:54,547 --> 00:28:56,481
Uh...Yeah.

541
00:28:56,549 --> 00:28:58,916
It's all coming back to me.

542
00:28:58,984 --> 00:29:01,452
Miss, uh, what is your name?

543
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,953

544
00:29:03,021 --> 00:29:04,822
Wait a minute.

Yeah.

548
00:29:09,961 --> 00:29:11,396
That's right.

549
00:29:11,463 --> 00:29:14,465
You printed one of
my letters last year.

550
00:29:14,533 --> 00:29:16,867
<i>Remember? Nice guys finish last.</i>

551

Yes!

553
00:29:20,739 --> 00:29:21,939
Oh, Stanley.

554
00:29:22,007 --> 00:29:26,143
Do you realize how much mail
we got about that letter?

555
00:29:26,212 --> 00:29:28,913
There are hundreds
of women out there

Yeah!

559
00:29:33,885 --> 00:29:36,421
Do you know how hard it is

560
00:29:36,488 --> 00:29:39,424
to find a decent man in this town?

561
00:29:39,491 --> 00:29:42,594
Most of them think monogamy
is some kind of wood.

562
00:29:44,496 --> 00:29:45,430
So, uh...

563
00:29:45,497 --> 00:29:47,699

00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,907
Hello.

755
00:42:43,975 --> 00:42:45,309
Club's closed. Move it!

756
00:42:45,376 --> 00:42:48,211
You think I'm joking?
Come on! Move it!

757
00:42:48,279 --> 00:42:50,981
Everyone. Let's go!

758
00:42:51,049 --> 00:42:52,515
Tina, get out of here.

759
00:42:52,583 --> 00:42:53,967
Come on. Party's over.

760
00:42:54,035 --> 00:42:54,968
Get lost!

761
00:42:55,036 --> 00:42:56,503
O.K., twinkle toes.

762
00:42:56,571 --> 00:42:59,540
I want to know
where my money is--

763
00:42:59,607 --> 00:43:00,774
right now!

764
00:43:00,841 --> 00:43:02,109
O.K.

765
00:43:06,347 --> 00:43:08,482
You've got 17.5% in t-bills

766
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:10,384
amortized over the fiscal year,

767
00:43:10,452 --> 00:43:12,352
8% in stock and bonds.

768
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:15,189
Carry the 9. Divide by
the gross national product.

769
00:43:15,256 --> 00:43:17,491
Fortunately, funeral
bouquets are deductible.

770
00:43:18,759 --> 00:43:20,461
Ice this deadbeat!

771
00:43:25,032 --> 00:43:26,433
Whoo!

772
00:43:26,501 --> 00:43:28,469

Ah...Ugh...Ahh.

782

Argh!

783
00:43:55,896 --> 00:43:57,964
Hold me close, red.

784
00:43:59,601 --> 00:44:01,268
It's gettin' dark.

785
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:04,704

786
00:44:06,007 --> 00:44:08,942

788
00:44:10,745 --> 00:44:12,045
Eew.

789
00:44:12,113 --> 00:44:13,931
[English accent] Tell tiny Tim

790
00:44:13,999 --> 00:44:16,466
I won't be coming
home this Christmas.

791
00:44:21,055 --> 00:44:23,256
Tell Scarlett I do give a damn.

792
00:44:24,926 --> 00:44:26,459
[Sniffling]

793
00:44:26,527 --> 00:44:27,494
[Pffft]

794
00:44:27,561 --> 00:44:28,729
Pardon me.

795
00:44:37,071 --> 00:44:38,705
Thank you!

796
00:44:40,574 --> 00:44:41,975
You love me.

797
00:44:42,043 --> 00:44:45,045
You really love me!

798
00:44:50,551 --> 00:44:52,318
You're not goin' anywhere.

799
00:44:55,056 --> 00:44:57,157
Whoo hoo hoo hoo!

800
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,227
Drop it, tyrrell!

801
00:45:04,532 --> 00:45:06,066
Hey, Kellaway.

802
00:45:06,134 --> 00:45:07,634
Drop it!

803
00:45:07,702 --> 00:45:09,469
All right.

804
00:45:09,537 --> 00:45:11,938
So you got a warrant this time,

805
00:45:12,006 --> 00:45:14,975
or you just stopped
by for a nightcap?

806
00:45:15,043 --> 00:45:17,778
What I got is probable cause.

807
00:45:17,845 --> 00:45:21,181
Couple of your boys were spotted
knocking over edge city bank.

808
00:45:21,248 --> 00:45:23,183
Easy. You're giving me a woody.

809
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:25,852
One was wearing a green mask.

810
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,988
For once, Kellaway, you're right.

811
00:45:28,056 --> 00:45:29,956
Except it wasn't one of my boys.

812
00:45:30,024 --> 00:45:33,660
Maybe if you tried a little
actual police work...

813
00:45:33,728 --> 00:45:35,095
Cuff him.

814
00:45:35,163 --> 00:45:36,462
Hey, lieutenant.
A stiff upstairs--

815
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:38,732
one of the guys from the heist.

816
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,634
Better call that high-priced
lawyer of yours, tyrrell.

817
00:45:41,703 --> 00:45:44,971
You and I are going downtown
for a little chat.

818
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:47,007
Get him outta here!

819
00:45:58,552 --> 00:46:00,286
Ipkiss.

[Knock on door]

821
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:07,944

[Knock knock knock]

826
00:46:14,418 --> 00:46:15,418
Oh!

827
00:46:15,486 --> 00:46:16,920
Open up.

828
00:46:16,988 --> 00:46:18,454
Oh, my God!

[Arf arf]

835
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:33,703
Open up.

836
00:46:33,771 --> 00:46:36,706
Come on. I'm getting
blisters on my fingers.

837
00:46:36,774 --> 00:46:38,942
No...No!

838
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:39,943
[Grr]

839
00:46:40,011 --> 00:46:41,477
No, no, no!

840
00:46:41,546 --> 00:46:42,946
Stop it!

841
00:46:43,014 --> 00:46:44,447
I'm coming!

842
00:46:44,515 --> 00:46:45,982
O.K., I'm coming!

843
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:47,884
I'll be right there.

[Arf arf]

845
00:46:51,923 --> 00:46:53,890
Let's go! Ipkiss!
Move it!

846
00:46:53,958 --> 00:46:55,458
All right!

847
00:46:55,526 --> 00:46:58,361
[Unlocking bolts]

848
00:47:01,532 --> 00:47:02,966
Hi, lieutenant.

849
00:47:03,034 --> 00:47:05,802
Listen, this isn't the
best time right now--

850
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:07,437
I just...

851
00:47:07,504 --> 00:47:09,739
Won't you come in?

852
00:47:11,475 --> 00:47:13,710
Where were you last night, Ipkiss?

853
00:47:13,778 --> 00:47:15,411
Here...Mostly.

854
00:47:15,479 --> 00:47:17,280
Is something wrong?

855
00:47:17,347 --> 00:47:20,283
What do you know about
this mask character?

856
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:21,517
Mask?

857
00:47:21,586 --> 00:47:23,219
Don't insult my
intelligence, Ipkiss.

858
00:47:23,287 --> 00:47:24,754
He robs your bank,

859
00:47:24,822 --> 00:47:27,156
then I find this in the coco bongo.

860
00:47:27,224 --> 00:47:29,859
There can't be two idiots
with pajamas like these.

861
00:47:29,927 --> 00:47:32,128
Milo, no!

862
00:47:32,196 --> 00:47:34,497
May I see those
pajamas, Mr. Ipkiss?

863
00:47:36,533 --> 00:47:37,934
Those...Pajamas?

864
00:47:38,002 --> 00:47:39,469
Those--those,
uh,

865
00:47:39,536 --> 00:47:42,038
those pajamas were...

866
00:47:42,106 --> 00:47:43,740
Stolen.

867
00:47:43,808 --> 00:47:46,476
Somebody stole your pajamas?

868
00:47:47,377 --> 00:47:48,478
Yeah.

869
00:47:48,545 --> 00:47:50,313
[Growling]

870
00:47:51,782 --> 00:47:53,249
I mean, uh,

871
00:47:53,317 --> 00:47:54,718
what is, uh,

872
00:47:54,785 --> 00:47:56,686
what is this city coming to

873
00:47:56,754 --> 00:47:59,723
when--when, uh, when
a man's pajama drawer

874
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:01,925
is no longer safe?

875
00:48:05,997 --> 00:48:07,897
Wow, look at that guy.

876
00:48:07,965 --> 00:48:09,899
Nobody's that fast at my bank.

877
00:48:09,967 --> 00:48:11,534
I'll say.

878
00:48:11,602 --> 00:48:12,902
Ahh.

879
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:14,403
I don't know, boss,

880
00:48:14,471 --> 00:48:16,706
that's one hell of a rubber mask.

881
00:48:16,774 --> 00:48:18,074
What about lab reports?

882
00:48:18,142 --> 00:48:20,877
We got some fingerprints
on some of the currency,

883
00:48:20,945 --> 00:48:22,378
but nothing matches tyrrell's men.

884
00:48:22,446 --> 00:48:24,347
This guy beat him to the punch.

885
00:48:24,414 --> 00:48:25,949
Get the bank employee files

886
00:48:26,017 --> 00:48:29,185
and run down the prints
of a Stanley Ipkiss.

887
00:48:29,253 --> 00:48:31,788
You figure it was an inside job?

888
00:48:31,856 --> 00:48:35,491
All I need is prints to lock
this whack job up till doomsday.

889
00:48:37,011 --> 00:48:38,445
50 grand.

890
00:48:38,512 --> 00:48:39,980
50 grand to the man

891
00:48:40,048 --> 00:48:43,283
who finds that
green-faced son of a bitch

892
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:44,718
before the cops do.

893
00:48:44,786 --> 00:48:47,487
I want you to get the word out

894
00:48:47,555 --> 00:48:50,457
to every street hustler, to
every lowlife in this town.

895
00:48:50,524 --> 00:48:51,959
You understand?

896
00:48:52,026 --> 00:48:54,260
I want him here tomorrow... Alive.

897
00:48:55,563 --> 00:48:57,330
You're still here?

898
00:48:57,398 --> 00:48:59,032
Come on, let's go!

899
00:49:03,471 --> 00:49:05,438
What are you lookin' at?

900
00:49:05,506 --> 00:49:06,907
You.

901
00:49:06,975 --> 00:49:08,441
You're losing it, Dorian.

902
00:49:08,509 --> 00:49:09,910
Uh-uh.

903
00:49:09,978 --> 00:49:11,945
I'm not losing anything...

904
00:49:12,013 --> 00:49:14,815
Except maybe some extra
baggage around here.

905
00:49:14,882 --> 00:49:16,416
What does that mean?

906
00:49:16,484 --> 00:49:19,452
You weren't putting
up much of a fight

907
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,122
when that freak show
tried to kiss you.

908
00:49:22,189 --> 00:49:23,624
Did it look like

909
00:49:23,691 --> 00:49:26,159
I had much of a choice?

910
00:49:26,227 --> 00:49:27,794
Maybe you did...

911
00:49:29,998 --> 00:49:31,431
Maybe you didn't.

912
00:49:31,499 --> 00:49:33,466
Who knows, right?

913
00:49:33,534 --> 00:49:36,202
I'll tell you one thing.

914
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:40,807
It's going to be payback
for anybody who crosses me.

915
00:49:49,016 --> 00:49:49,982
Ipkiss!

916
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:51,451
We have a crisis here,

917
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:53,953
and you stroll in an hour late?

918
00:49:54,021 --> 00:49:56,956
If I have to put up with
your slovenly behavior--

919
00:49:57,024 --> 00:49:58,458
back off, monkey boy...

920
00:49:58,526 --> 00:49:59,959
Before I tell daddy

921
00:50:00,027 --> 00:50:03,463
you're running this place like
it's your own personal piggy bank.

922
00:50:03,531 --> 00:50:05,965
Or maybe we should call the IRS?

923
00:50:06,033 --> 00:50:10,570
See if we can arrange a little
vacation for you at club fed!

924
00:50:11,972 --> 00:50:13,807
That'll be all, Ipkiss.

925
00:50:16,544 --> 00:50:17,644
[Deep exhalation]

926
00:50:17,712 --> 00:50:19,011
Genius.

927
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:20,480
That was genius.

928
00:50:20,548 --> 00:50:21,981
Buddy, I have chills.

929
00:50:22,049 --> 00:50:26,653
God! What side of whose
bed did you wake up on, man?

930
00:50:26,721 --> 00:50:28,154
I'm not sure.

931
00:50:28,222 --> 00:50:30,690
I haven't exactly
been myself lately.

932
00:50:30,758 --> 00:50:33,493
Well, you don't look
real fabulous, Stan.

933
00:50:33,561 --> 00:50:34,527
Really?

934
00:50:34,595 --> 00:50:35,995
Do I look bad?

935
00:50:36,063 --> 00:50:37,497
Ah! Not to worry.

936
00:50:37,565 --> 00:50:40,500
This will put the color
back in your cheeks.

937
00:50:40,568 --> 00:50:43,035
Two tickets to the charity ball

938
00:50:43,103 --> 00:50:46,005
at the coco bongo club
this Saturday night.

939
00:50:46,073 --> 00:50:47,507
<i>Everybody will be there.</i>

940
00:50:47,575 --> 00:50:49,542
Want to be my date?

941
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:51,177
Ah,
Charlie, I--

942
00:50:55,916 --> 00:50:57,350
wait just a minute.

943
00:50:57,418 --> 00:50:59,886
Tina, what are you doing here?

944
00:50:59,953 --> 00:51:01,888
I wanted to thank you, but, um...

945
00:51:01,955 --> 00:51:05,925
I'm not sure I'll have much
to open an account with.

946
00:51:05,993 --> 00:51:09,396
What about the club? I
thought you were doing great.

947
00:51:09,463 --> 00:51:10,930
Look, it's not your problem.

948
00:51:10,998 --> 00:51:12,265
I'll be o.K.

949
00:51:12,332 --> 00:51:13,900
Tina, come here.

950
00:51:17,405 --> 00:51:21,508
You didn't stop by
just to see me, did you?

951
00:51:24,077 --> 00:51:26,212
It's o.K. Tell me.

952
00:51:28,582 --> 00:51:31,418
The guy they say
robbed this place...

953
00:51:31,485 --> 00:51:32,419
The mask.

954
00:51:32,486 --> 00:51:35,388
I think he was at
the club last night.

955
00:51:35,456 --> 00:51:36,523
Really?

956
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:38,157
They say he's pretty...

957
00:51:39,427 --> 00:51:40,660
Weird-looking.

958
00:51:43,096 --> 00:51:44,497
Yeah, but...

959
00:51:44,565 --> 00:51:47,333
You ought to see him dance.

960
00:51:49,069 --> 00:51:50,503
So did, um,

961
00:51:50,571 --> 00:51:53,072
anyone find out who he is?

962
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:55,274
Why, are you interested?

963
00:51:56,610 --> 00:51:58,678
Just curious, I guess.

964
00:52:00,581 --> 00:52:01,548
Well...

965
00:52:01,615 --> 00:52:03,616
I better be going.

966
00:52:04,552 --> 00:52:06,619
Thanks for everything, Stanley.

967
00:52:08,422 --> 00:52:11,190
You'd like to see him
again, wouldn't you?

968
00:52:13,561 --> 00:52:14,794
I, um...

969
00:52:16,063 --> 00:52:17,764
Wouldn't mind.

970
00:52:17,832 --> 00:52:20,467
I know him, you know.

971
00:52:20,534 --> 00:52:22,234
You do?

972
00:52:22,302 --> 00:52:25,271
We're old college
buddies, him and me.

973
00:52:25,339 --> 00:52:27,740
Yeah, it's funny you should mention

974
00:52:27,808 --> 00:52:30,409
the way he dances because, uh...

975
00:52:33,547 --> 00:52:37,016
I taught him a couple
of dance moves myself.

976
00:52:37,084 --> 00:52:40,487
Do you think you could
have him meet me tonight?

977
00:52:40,554 --> 00:52:42,989
I might be able to
work something out.

978
00:52:43,056 --> 00:52:44,524
How about at landfill park?

979
00:52:44,592 --> 00:52:45,859
O.K., at sunset?

980
00:52:45,926 --> 00:52:46,860
Perfect.

981
00:52:46,927 --> 00:52:47,994
Super.

982
00:52:49,096 --> 00:52:52,164
Thanks, Stanley. You
really are a nice guy.

983
00:52:59,122 --> 00:53:01,691
This is an interesting
piece, Mr. Ipkiss.

984
00:53:01,759 --> 00:53:04,694
Looks like fourth or
fifth century Scandinavian.

985
00:53:04,762 --> 00:53:07,697
Possibly a representation
of a norse night God.

986
00:53:07,765 --> 00:53:09,231
Maybe loki.

987
00:53:11,769 --> 00:53:13,202
Loki?

988
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:15,472
Who's loki?

989
00:53:15,539 --> 00:53:17,474
The norse God of mischief.

990
00:53:17,541 --> 00:53:20,009
Supposedly he caused
so much trouble

991
00:53:20,077 --> 00:53:23,045
that odin banished him
from Valhalla forever.

992
00:53:24,281 --> 00:53:27,784
Then he could've banished
him into that mask.

993
00:53:27,852 --> 00:53:30,453
I'm talking about
mythology, Mr. Ipkiss.

994
00:53:30,521 --> 00:53:32,956
This is a piece of wood.

995
00:53:33,023 --> 00:53:35,525
But your book!

996
00:53:35,593 --> 00:53:38,995
My book is about masks
as metaphor, Mr. Ipkiss.

997
00:53:39,062 --> 00:53:41,998
A metaphor. Not to
be taken literally.

998
00:53:42,065 --> 00:53:44,266
You're suffering
from mild delusion.

999
00:53:45,836 --> 00:53:46,936
Ohh!

1000
00:53:47,004 --> 00:53:48,571
All right.

1001
00:53:51,642 --> 00:53:54,577
I'm going to prove it to you.

1002
00:53:54,645 --> 00:53:58,014
But I am not responsible
for the consequences.

1003
00:53:58,081 --> 00:54:02,719
Just sit back and enjoy
the ride, Mr. expert.

1004
00:54:02,786 --> 00:54:06,122
You don't scare me, Mr.
Ipkiss. Go right ahead.

1005
00:54:06,189 --> 00:54:08,290
See ya.

1006
00:54:12,496 --> 00:54:13,930
Coo-yaah!

1007
00:54:16,333 --> 00:54:18,935
Whoooo!

1008
00:54:19,003 --> 00:54:21,070
[Moaning]

1009
00:54:21,138 --> 00:54:23,105
Whoo-hoo!

1010
00:54:23,173 --> 00:54:25,775
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1011
00:54:25,843 --> 00:54:27,143
Yee-yee!

1012
00:54:28,846 --> 00:54:32,782
Ee-ee-ee-ee-ee!

1013
00:54:33,851 --> 00:54:36,619
O.K.! You said loki
was a night God.

1014
00:54:36,687 --> 00:54:38,955
Maybe it only works at night.

1015
00:54:39,023 --> 00:54:41,791
Mr. Ipkiss, I feel
I should warn you

1016
00:54:41,859 --> 00:54:44,794
that I don't work with
really sick people.

1017
00:54:44,862 --> 00:54:47,697
There are private institutions
for things like that.

1018
00:54:47,765 --> 00:54:49,032
However, if you like,

1019
00:54:49,099 --> 00:54:51,768
I can arrange for a
safe environment tonight.

1020
00:54:51,835 --> 00:54:53,469
No.

1021
00:54:55,372 --> 00:54:57,740
I've got to see Tina.

1022
00:54:57,808 --> 00:54:59,742
But what do I do?

1023
00:54:59,810 --> 00:55:00,777
I mean,

1024
00:55:00,844 --> 00:55:02,779
do I go as myself...

1025
00:55:02,846 --> 00:55:05,181
Or the mask?

1026
00:55:05,248 --> 00:55:07,149
If I tell you,

1027
00:55:07,217 --> 00:55:10,820
you promise to leave
my office right now?

1028
00:55:10,888 --> 00:55:12,789
Uh-huh.

1029
00:55:12,856 --> 00:55:14,256
All right.

1030
00:55:14,324 --> 00:55:15,925
Mr. Ipkiss...

1031
00:55:17,327 --> 00:55:21,097
<i>Go as yourself and as the mask...</i>

1032
00:55:21,164 --> 00:55:26,035
Because they are both one
and the same beautiful person.

1033
00:55:26,103 --> 00:55:29,371
<i>[Police radio] Got the cross-check
on the fingerprints for you.</i>

1034
00:55:29,439 --> 00:55:30,773
<i>It's Ipkiss, all right.</i>

1035
00:55:30,841 --> 00:55:32,274
I'm looking at him.

1036
00:55:32,342 --> 00:55:34,777
Just keep the s.W.A.T.
Team standing by.

1037
00:55:34,845 --> 00:55:37,313
If he's half as bad as advertised,

1038
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:39,315
we'll have a full dance card.

1039
00:55:39,382 --> 00:55:40,817
You have the pickle relish?

1040
00:55:40,884 --> 00:55:41,784
Doyle, get in.

1041
00:55:41,852 --> 00:55:43,252
But I ordered onion rings.

1042
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:44,386
Doyle!

1043
00:55:55,065 --> 00:55:56,599
[Sigh]

1044
00:56:06,977 --> 00:56:08,244
No.

1045
00:56:08,311 --> 00:56:09,445
No.

1046
00:56:09,513 --> 00:56:10,412
Stanley.

1047
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,749
What are you doing here?

1048
00:56:12,816 --> 00:56:14,250
Tina, hi.

1049
00:56:14,317 --> 00:56:16,753
Uh...I--I just
wanted to come by

1050
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:20,289
and make sure that you
two got together all right.

1051
00:56:20,357 --> 00:56:21,290
That's nice.

1052
00:56:21,358 --> 00:56:24,293
You know, I hardly
ever stop by here.

1053
00:56:24,361 --> 00:56:26,262
Kind of hard to believe

1054
00:56:26,329 --> 00:56:28,631
it was just a garbage heap.

1055
00:56:28,699 --> 00:56:30,767
Yeah, it's, uh...

1056
00:56:30,834 --> 00:56:32,468
It's, uh, it's...

1057
00:56:32,536 --> 00:56:33,803
Really beautiful

1058
00:56:33,871 --> 00:56:35,772
right around sunset.

1059
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:37,506
The methane emissions really

1060
00:56:37,574 --> 00:56:39,175
pick up the colors.

1061
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:41,510
All those...

Uhh...

1064
00:56:50,187 --> 00:56:53,723
My friend'll be along
any minute. I better go.

1065
00:56:55,559 --> 00:56:57,359
Stanley, wait.

1066
00:56:57,427 --> 00:56:58,360

We meet again.

1072
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:07,770
Is it fate?

1073
00:57:07,838 --> 00:57:09,739
Is it meant to be?

1074
00:57:09,807 --> 00:57:11,874
Is it written in the stars

1075
00:57:11,942 --> 00:57:14,410
that we are destined to fraternize?

1076
00:57:14,477 --> 00:57:16,913
