Morning, everybody.

331
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,050
- Hi, Oz.
- Mrs. Graham.

332
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:39,280
Morning, Arthur.

333
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,190
Hello. Hello, everyone.

334
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,590
So, everyone's here.

335
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,360
- Hello, Ray. My Galahad.
- Good morning.

336
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,900
<font color="#ff00ff">(CHUCKLES)</font> Thank you.

337
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,800
<font color="#ff00ff">(CLEARS THROAT)</font>

338
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:03,540
And I used to be the only one

339
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,470
who brought
his homework to class.

340
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,740
<font color="#ff00ff">(LAUGHTER)</font>

341
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,550
I think we're all here.
Should we get started?

342
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,950
Didn't you crash the wedding

343
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:14,250
of Nixon's other daughter
to get a story?

344
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,050
Well, I did get a story but I
didn't crash Julie's wedding.

345
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,120
No, just the reception
afterwards, right?

346
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,350
There is a distinction.

347
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,460
Not to
the father of the bride.

348
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,760
He's paying per plate.

349
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,530
I think the American people
are paying per plate.

350
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,060
<font color="#138ce9">HOWARD:</font> Wait, let's do
a story about that.

351
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,500
- Yeah, let's...
- Judith should crash again.

352
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,730
I didn't crash
Julie's wedding.

353
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,030
What would you
call it, Judith?

354
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,870
Well, I would call it
deft reportage.

355
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,500
All right, come on,
come on, everybody.

356
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:37,640
How are we gonna cover
this Nixon-Cox wedding?

357
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,950
Uh... Who else
is gonna be there?

358
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,410
- Here.
- Judith's got the guest list.

359
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,280
No, I mean of
the other press.

360
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,290
<i>The Times, the Sun, the Globe,</i>
all the international papers.

361
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,950
All right.

362
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,630
So, we call them,
we call all of them...

363
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,460
and we say Nixon
has shut us out...

364
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,160
and then we ask them
for their notes.

365
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,570
Ben, there's no way in hell
anyone's gonna give me a fill.

366
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:07,500
No, it'll be
an act of solidarity.

367
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:10,010
They'll be defending
the First Amendment.

368
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,840
We'll tell them
that the only way

369
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,780
to protect
the right to publish...

370
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,980
is to publish.

371
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,490
I don't understand.

372
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,290
You said
we'd set the price at $27.

373
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:26,850
No, we said there was a range.

374
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,620
And the demand on the
road show was soft.

375
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:32,760
Why not set it at $26?
Or $25 even?

376
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,660
Well, Paul, we feel
that setting the price

377
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,730
at $24.50 would be
more prudent.

378
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:38,170
It's just a couple bucks.

379
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,040
It's not just
a couple of bucks.

380
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,810
It's 1.35 million shares...

381
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,980
so it is...

382
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,280
Three million.

383
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:52,650
Over $3 million less.
That's a lot to a newspaper.

384
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,550
How many reporters is that?

385
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,650
It's 25.

386
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,020
Let's not get bogged down.

387
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,450
<font color="#138ce9">PAUL:</font> It has to be quite a few.

388
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,060
<font color="#138ce9">ARTHUR:</font> At least a dozen. Fritz?

389
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,260
It's 25 reporters.

390
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,430
Twenty-five reporters.

391
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,700
Twenty-five reporters.

392
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,830
Gentlemen,
we know it's not ideal...

393
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,170
but a few of our investors

394
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:13,470
balked at the nature
of the company.

395
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,700
They don't like newspapers?

396
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,470
They like Gannett and
Knight and Ridder...

397
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,670
but frankly they're concerned

398
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,280
about your ability
to turn a serious profit.

399
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,290
Gannett and Knight and Ridder

400
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:38,190
own monopoly papers
in smaller markets.

401
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,430
That's why
they're more profitable.

402
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:43,670
The whole point of the
offering is to grow...

403
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:45,830
while investing in the quality
of the paper.

404
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,200
Kay and I have talked
a great deal about this...

405
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:52,210
and we believe
that improving quality...

406
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:55,850
will naturally lead to
greater profitability.

407
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:58,850
Unfortunate.

408
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,850
It's more than unfortunate.

409
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,620
Doesn't this happen
all the time?

410
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,890
Bankers lowering the price for
their institutional investors.

411
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,560
Fritz, isn't this
what we discussed?

412
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,720
I think the family
should consider

413
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:09,890
giving up some control.

414
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,090
- Maybe another board seat.
- Absolutely not.

415
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,600
This isn't a surprise, Fritz.
Ever since Phil's accident...

416
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,730
<font color="#138ce9">FRITZ:</font> Arthur.

417
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:18,200
No offense, Kay.
It's unfortunate...

418
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,900
but the buyers
are obviously skittish

419
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,340
about having
a woman in charge...

420
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,540
and it's not like
it's an easy sell.

421
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:26,680
It's a local paper with modest
margins, modest ambitions.

422
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,110
<font color="#138ce9">PAUL:</font> I think Mr. Bradlee
would take issue

423

<font color="#138ce9">ARTHUR:</font> Sure, she pads

426
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,020
miss my lunch at Occidental.

427
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,920
Another dozen reporters.
For what?

428
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,690
To nip at the heels
of <i>The Times?</i>

429
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:39,850
So we can pretend like

430
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,860
we're even remotely
in the same league?

431
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:44,230
Make it a five o'clock drink
at the Jefferson.

432
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:46,330
<font color="#138ce9">FRITZ:</font> Arthur, Kay was right.
Lazard is just trying...

433
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:47,590
to cut a better deal

434
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,760
<font color="#138ce9">ARTHUR:</font> Come on, Fritz.

435
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:49,830
Why do you think that is?

436
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,030
<font color="#138ce9">FRITZ:</font> Because they're bankers.

437
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,600
<font color="#138ce9">ARTHUR:</font> Which is why
they want more control.

438
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,740
They want assurances

439
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,870
that she's not
gonna squander it all.

440
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:56,640
I mean, come on.

441
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,040
Fritz, Kay throws
a great party...

442
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,880
but her father gave the paper
to her husband.

443
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,610
The only reason
she's running things

444
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,980
is because he...
Because Phil died.

445
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:10,950
Don't get me wrong,
I think she is a lovely woman.

446
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,820
But she got rid
of Al Friendly...

447
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,290
and brought in a pirate

448
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:16,960
who does nothing
but bleed our margins.

449
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,630
I mean, you can't be surprised

450
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,860
that the buyers
are concerned...

451
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,100
that she doesn't have
the resolve

452
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,070
to turn a serious profit.

453
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,840
Kay, it's your decision...

454
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,970
but in my opinion,
if you want this

455
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,240
to be more than
a little family paper...

456
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:38,520
it has to be more than
a little family business.

457
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:44,420
Thank you, Arthur,
for your frankness.

458
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,020
All right.

459
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:49,390

Phil's suicide.

465
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:06,940
I don't know why people insist
on calling it an accident.

466
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:10,650
Is it to make them
feel better?

467
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:14,950
Or do they think
they're being kind?

give up more seats

Of course not.

We're going to be fine.

473
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,700

is nothing if not vindictive.

the White House has been

670
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:10,650
lying about the Vietnam War
for 30 years.

671
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:15,960
It's Truman and Eisenhower
and Jack and LBJ lying.

672
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,260
Lying about Vietnam.

673
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:20,160

Maybe.

You flew down to Texas
with Lyndon

691
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,380
the weekend
after his convention.

692
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,650
That's your fault. You wanted
to see his helicopter land.

693
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,920
And the instant he saw you,
he invited you to the ranch.

694
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,320
Oh, well, he just wanted
the paper to endorse.

695
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:23,590
Yes, but my point is

696
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,560
you had Steve and Bill
waiting at home.

697
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,760
- You had houseguests...
- I know.

698

...waiting at the farm.

699
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,760
You had nothing but dirty

he's my friend and...

I appreciate the implication
of what you just said.

748

McNamara is talking
to you...

749
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,590
because you are the publisher
of <i>The Washington Post.</i>

750
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,420
That's not true.
No, that is not why.

751
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,320
Because he wants you
to bail him out.

752
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:38,430
Because he wants you
on his side.

No!

I wouldn't presume to tell you
how to write about him.

756
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:49,040
Just as I wouldn't
take it upon myself...

757
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,010
to tell him he should hand
over a classified study...

758
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:55,640
which would be a crime,
by the way...

759
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:58,750
just so he can serve
as your source.

771

Ben, they are
the source of the story.

834
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,410
Every time I read <i>The New York

835
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:48,540
- Mr. Bradlee?
- No.

836
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,440

a hot poker up my ass.

848

Yeah, it was

00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:21,270
It was a good piece.
You should check it out.

00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,640
- It was well-written.
- Jesus Christ.

857
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:25,010
Give it to someone who can't
type 91 words a minute...

858
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:26,810
and have it proofed, okay?

859
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,110
- Ben?
- Yeah?

860
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,850
I think we got something.

861
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:31,290
What is it?

00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,660
Jesus Christ.

863
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:42,930
Shit. Are these

864
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:44,530
part of the pages
of the McNamara study?

865
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:45,700
Where did you get these?

866
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,440
Somebody left them on my desk.

867
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,470
On your desk?

868
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:50,900
- I didn't... It was a woman.
- A woman?

869
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:53,640
We got over 100 pages
of the McNamara study here.

870
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,640
A hippie woman.

871
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:57,180
Hey, Debbie,
get me Bagdikian.

872
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,280
She had one of those skirts...

He's out.
He went somewhere.

Fine.

875
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,520
Probably
between 5'4 " and 5'6"...

00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:06,790
If these are the real thing,
we are back in the ballgame.

877
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:08,220
It was a tie-dye skirt.

878
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:11,390
And this is gonna be the front

had leaked from RAND...

891
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:51,570
I'd bug the phone of the

893

A copy of which was sent to
RAND for safekeeping.

Two copies,

You sure about that?

00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:06,250
Look, in my experience...

898
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:08,020
guys who
want stuff like this out there

899
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,220
and have the guts to do it...

900
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:10,520

902

but they've also got ego.

903
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:16,920
Now, there's a guy that
we both know, okay?

904
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:18,760
He was there
the same time as I was.

905
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,190
He left right after.

907
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:23,530
Isn't he the first guy

a big speech.

- No, no, no, no.
- Poor you.

No, going public is

Maybe you can even think
about expanding.

I wish Abe would
let me buy shares.

That's against

00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:25,730
McNamara wanted
academics to have

1155
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:27,560
the chance to examine
what had happened.

1156
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:28,660
He would say to us,

1157
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:30,360
"Let the chips fall
where they may."

1158
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,570
Brave man.

1159
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:34,330
Well, I think guilt was a
bigger motivator than courage.

1160
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:36,240
McNamara didn't lie
as well as the rest...

1161
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,340
but I don't think he saw what
was coming, what we'd find.

1162
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:41,570
But it didn't take him long
to figure out...

1163
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:42,680
well, for us all
to figure out

1164
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,510
if the public ever saw
these papers...

1165
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:46,150
they would turn
against the war.

1166
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:49,150
Covert ops, guaranteed debt,
rigged elections?

1167
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:53,090
It's all in there.
Ike, Kennedy, Johnson.

1168
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:54,790
They violated
the Geneva Convention.

1169
00:55:54,790 --> 00:55:57,520
They lied to Congress
and they lied to the public.

1170
00:55:57,530 --> 00:56:01,690
They knew we couldn't win
and still sent boys to die.

1171
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:03,430
What about Nixon?

1172
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:06,500
He's just carrying on
like all the others.

1173
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:09,770
Too afraid to be the one who
loses the war on his watch.

1174
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:14,040
Someone said this
at some point...

1175
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,980
about why we stayed
when we knew we were losing.

1176
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:20,480
10% was to help
the South Vietnamese.

1177
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,350
20% was to hold back
the commies.

1178
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:25,550
70% was to avoid

1179
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:28,320
the humiliation
of an American defeat.

1180
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:32,530
70% of those boys...

1181
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:34,830
just to avoid
being humiliated?

1182
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:37,070

1482
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:05,540
That is a felony, Ben.

1483
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:07,470
That's only
if the documents we print

1484
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:08,810
could damage
the United States.

1485
01:10:08,810 --> 01:10:10,640
There's a federal judge
in New York

1486
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:11,810
who seems to think
that they could.

1487
01:10:11,810 --> 01:10:13,110
Well, I've got
six seasoned journalists

1488
01:10:13,110 --> 01:10:14,410
in the next room...

1489
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:16,050
who've been reporting on this
war for the last ten years...

1490
01:10:16,050 --> 01:10:18,180
and I'll lay odds that they
have a better idea...

1491
01:10:18,190 --> 01:10:19,690
of what could damage
the United States

1492
01:10:19,690 --> 01:10:20,820
than some judge...

1493
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:22,090
who is just now wading

1494
01:10:22,090 --> 01:10:23,820
into this territory
for the first time.

1495
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:26,260
"Wading." Is that a metaphor
for Vietnam?

1496
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:29,230
Okay. Ben, look, we know
your reporters are talented.

1497
01:10:29,230 --> 01:10:31,530
But <i>The New York Times</i>
spent three months

1498
01:10:31,530 --> 01:10:33,570
going over these documents.

1499
01:10:33,570 --> 01:10:35,400
You've got, what,
seven hours now

1500
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:36,740
until the paper goes to press?

1501
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:39,140
Can you honestly tell me
that that is enough time...

1502
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:43,210
to make sure
not a single military plan,

1503
01:10:43,210 --> 01:10:44,340
not a single U.S. soldier...

1504
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:47,250
not a single American life
will be put in harm's way?

1505
01:10:47,250 --> 01:10:48,850
That this will do no damage

1506
01:10:48,850 --> 01:10:51,080
to the United States
if you publish?

1507
01:10:51,090 --> 01:10:52,120
Yes.

1513
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:05,660
the study was for posterity.

1514
01:11:05,670 --> 01:11:07,830
It was written for academics
in the future...

1515
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,630
and right now we're still
in the middle of the war.

1516
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:11,200
The papers can't be objective.

1517
01:11:11,210 --> 01:11:13,640
And I suppose the public
has a right to know...

1518
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:15,910
but I would prefer
that the study

1519
01:11:15,910 --> 01:11:17,340
not be made
widely available...

1520
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:20,410

01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:30,760
You and Marg

1526
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:32,960
at the lowest point
of my life.

1527
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:36,560
You helped me, you selected
my entire board...

1528
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:39,230
you're my most
trusted advisor...

1529
01:11:39,230 --> 01:11:40,830
my dear friend.

1530
01:11:41,770 --> 01:11:45,240
But my feelings about that
and about you...

1531
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:48,940
can't be part of this decision
to publish or not.

1532
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:53,510
I'm here
asking your advice, Bob...

1533
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:56,250
not your permission.

1534
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:59,220
Well, then as one of your
most trusted advisors...

1535
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:01,520
and someone who knows how much
you care about this company...

1536
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:02,650
I'm worried, Kay.

1537
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:04,190
I worked in Washington
for ten years,

1538
01:12:04,190 --> 01:12:05,660
I've seen
these people up close.

1539
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:07,960
Bobby and Lyndon,
they were tough customers,

1540
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:10,060
but Nixon is different.

1541
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:12,300
He's got some real bad
people around him.

1542
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:14,530
And if you publish he'll
get the very worst of them.

1543
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:15,770
The Colsons
and the Ehrlichmans

1544
01:12:15,770 --> 01:12:16,900
and he'll crush you.

1545
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:18,270
I know he's just awful,
but I...

1546
01:12:18,270 --> 01:12:21,140
Nixon's a son of a bitch!
He hates you.

1547
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:22,140
He hates Ben.

1548
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:23,310
He's wanted to ruin
the paper for years...

1549
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:26,110
and you will not get
a second chance, Kay.

1550
01:12:26,110 --> 01:12:28,010
The Richard Nixon I know
will muster

1551
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:29,680
the full power
of the presidency...

1552
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:31,680
and if there's a way
to destroy your paper,

1553
01:12:31,690 --> 01:12:33,990

01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:46,770

1560
01:12:46,770 --> 01:12:47,830
Ben, you need
to listen to them.

1561
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:48,970
Hey, Fritz.
Good to see you.

1562
01:12:48,970 --> 01:12:50,030
This is about
the future of the company

1563
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:51,340
and ensuring there is one.

1564
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:53,570
That's a little melodramatic,
don't you think?

1565
01:12:53,570 --> 01:12:54,970
Melodramatic?
You're talking about

1566
01:12:54,970 --> 01:12:58,080
exposing years
of government secrets.

1567
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:00,710
I can't imagine they're
gonna take that lightly.

1568
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:02,250
You could jeopardize
the public offering.

1569
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:04,380
You could jeopardize
our television stations.

1570
01:13:04,390 --> 01:13:06,520
You know a felon can't
hold a broadcast license.

1571
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,550
You think I give two shits
about the television stations?

1572
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:09,620
You should.
They make a hell of

1573
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:10,890
a lot more money
than you do...

1574
01:13:10,890 --> 01:13:13,190
and without that revenue
we'll be forced to sell.

1575
01:13:13,190 --> 01:13:15,260
If the government wins
and we're convicted...

1576
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:18,130
<i>The Washington Post</i> as we
know it will cease to exist.

1577
01:13:18,130 --> 01:13:19,830
If we live in a world
where the government

1578
01:13:19,830 --> 01:13:21,600
can tell us what we can
and cannot print...

1579
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:22,800
then <i>The Washington Post</i>
as we know it

1580
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:25,110
has already ceased to exist.

1581
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:28,010
What if we wait?

1582
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,980
What if we hold off
on printing today

1583
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:33,380
and instead we call
the Attorney General...

1584
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:36,150
and we tell him that
we intend to print on Sunday?

1585
01:13:36,150 --> 01:13:37,850
That way we give
them and us time

1586

the legality of all of it...

decides <i>The Times'</i> case.

1588

to the fact that we
have these documents...

1590

I just want to thank you all
for coming out this evening...

1645
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:55,650
to help me launch
Harry Gladstein...

1646
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:57,820

1647

very well earned retirement.

1649

It's Mr. Beebe on the phone.

1653
01:16:16,010 --> 01:16:19,680
Uh, Phil Graham first brought
Harry to the company.

1654
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:22,650
- I'm afraid they need you now.
- And I remember, he told me...

Kay is in a position

that you're not good enough.

1851
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:44,940
That your opinion
doesn't matter as much.

1852

When they don't
just look past you.

1853

And you hopped
in the car with me.

like the idea

1976
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:49,530
of Kay as a convicted felon.

1977
01:32:49,540 --> 01:32:51,330
And then there's the
issue of the prospectus.

1978
01:32:51,340 --> 01:32:52,770
Based on
the conversations I've had

1979
01:32:52,770 --> 01:32:54,000
with my friends at Cravath...

1980
01:32:54,010 --> 01:32:55,440
I believe
a criminal indictment

1981
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:58,010
would qualify
as a catastrophic event.

1982
01:32:58,010 --> 01:33:01,210
And given the likelihood
of indictment now...

1983
01:33:02,780 --> 01:33:03,910
Kay, it could...

1984
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:06,450
Yes, I understand.

1985
01:33:07,890 --> 01:33:11,160
We have a responsibility
to the company...

1986
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:12,360
to all the employees

1987
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:14,690
and to the long-term health
of the paper.

1988
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:17,130
Absolutely, Kay.

1989
01:33:20,170 --> 01:33:23,200
Yes. However, um...

1990
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:33,480
The prospectus
also talks about...

1991
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:36,550
the mission
of the paper, which is...

1992
01:33:36,550 --> 01:33:38,180
"outstanding news collection

1993
01:33:38,180 --> 01:33:40,190
"and reporting,"
isn't that right?

1994
01:33:40,190 --> 01:33:41,250
Yes.

1995
01:33:41,250 --> 01:33:42,150
And...

1996
01:33:42,150 --> 01:33:44,750
And it also says...

1997
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:45,960
that the newspaper will

1998
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:48,190
"be dedicated to the welfare
of the nation...

1999
01:33:48,190 --> 01:33:51,060
"and to the, uh, principles
of a free press..."

2000
01:33:51,060 --> 01:33:52,460
Yes, but...

2001
01:33:52,470 --> 01:33:57,070
So, one could argue that the
bankers were put on notice.

2002
01:33:57,070 --> 01:33:59,500
But Kay, these are
extraordinary circumstances.

2003
01:33:59,510 --> 01:34:02,510
Are they? Are they?
For a newspaper?

2004
01:34:02,510 --> 01:34:05,140
One that covers
the Nixon White House.

2005
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:07,980
Can you guarantee me that
we could go to print...

2006
01:34:07,980 --> 01:34:09,810
without endangering
any of our soldiers?

2007
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:11,250
You can't be considering...

2008
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:13,790
I'm talking
to Mr. Bradlee now.

2009
01:34:17,620 --> 01:34:20,060
Fritz, you're not gonna
let her do this.

2010
01:34:20,060 --> 01:34:21,190
She can't go to...

2011
01:34:21,190 --> 01:34:23,030
No, now, she can, Arthur.

2012
01:34:23,030 --> 01:34:24,460
And it's entirely
her decision.

2013
01:34:24,460 --> 01:34:27,130
Kay, you're allowing
Mr. Bradlee...

2014
01:34:27,130 --> 01:34:29,000
<font color="#ff00ff">(STUTTERS)</font>
to lead you to folly.

2015
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,630
The legacy of the company
is at stake

2016
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:33,200
and if you want
to protect that legacy...

2017
01:34:33,210 --> 01:34:35,040
This company's
been in my life...

2018
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:36,210
for longer
than most of the people

2019
01:34:36,210 --> 01:34:37,610
working there have been alive.

2020
01:34:37,610 --> 01:34:40,780
So, I don't need
the lecture on legacy.

2021
01:34:42,450 --> 01:34:46,520
And this is no longer
my father's company.

2022
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:48,890
It's no longer
my husband's company.

2023
01:34:48,890 --> 01:34:51,020
It's my company.

2024
01:34:51,020 --> 01:34:52,920
And anyone
who thinks otherwise...

2025
01:34:52,930 --> 01:34:56,130
probably doesn't belong
on my board.

2026

that we can go to...

Your Honor,
the stories published

01:38:47,730 --> 01:38:49,030
in <i>The Times</i>
and now <i>The Post</i>...

2083

and security disaster
for the United States.

2085
01:38:52,430 --> 01:38:55,700
How exactly have these papers
created a diplomatic disaster?

2086
01:38:55,700 --> 01:38:58,170
Why would other countries
talk to us in confidence...

2087
01:38:58,170 --> 01:38:59,700
if secrets like this
can be leaked?

2088
01:38:59,710 --> 01:39:01,140
So, does this
make it difficult

2089
01:39:01,140 --> 01:39:02,540
for the President to govern?

2090
01:39:02,540 --> 01:39:05,340
If the President can't
keep secrets, he can't govern.

2091
01:39:05,340 --> 01:39:07,140
Nothing less
than the integrity

it's raising
the profile of <i>The Post.</i>

2101
01:39:37,780 --> 01:39:41,380
Would <i>The Post</i> have published

2102
01:39:41,380 --> 01:39:44,450
if they'd had them in advance?

2103

<i>by President Johnson's
reaction...</i>

2131
01:40:59,930 --> 01:41:02,660
<i>to these revelations

2132
01:41:02,660 --> 01:41:04,590

there's an entrance

around the side

I was supposed to be here
half hour ago...

2158
01:42:33,450 --> 01:42:34,920
but then I had to
make copies of the brief

2159
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:36,520
and there
was so much traffic...

2160
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:37,620

No, you wouldn't.
You work for Roger Clark then?
