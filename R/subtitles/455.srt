You know, look, I know Peter.
I know him.

698

He's not gonna spend
all his time taking care of the kids.

699
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:25,580
He went and hired somebody!

Listen, Peter is nothing
if not responsible.

It's not like he's gonna
hire a convicted felon.

being framed and all.

- No.

The prosecution interviewed
an eyewitness,

and she told them that the perpetrator
didn't have a tattoo on the chest.

00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:18,157
You gotta feel it. Now, come on.

1039
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:20,326
Show me how you made them kids.

1040
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:21,827
Makes me feel this way

1041
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,496
Ooh

1042
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,081
- What the hell...
- How's this?

1043
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:27,291
That's great for an epileptic.
Come on, now.

1044
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:28,667
You gotta move your pelvis with it.

1045
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:31,670
More hips. There you go.

1046
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:33,047
Get smooth with it.

1047
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:36,175
I can't resist this sweet surrender

1048
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:39,929
Well, I'm sorry. I can't help it. I miss him.

1049
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:41,972
Oh, snap out of it, already.

1050
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:45,184
I'm snapped. I'm snappy.

1051
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:50,189
And what we see is no surprise

1052
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:53,567
Oh, God, Ash.

1053
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:55,653
I still can't believe you were hit by a car.

1054
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,864
Did you call a lawyer?

1055
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:01,367
Oh, I can't talk to a lawyer.
I was jaywalking.

1056
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:02,660
So, can we just stop...

1057
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:06,831
- What?
- Oh, my God.

1058
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:10,209
- (GASPS)
- What?

1059
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:18,175
Look at that!

1060
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:21,887
Oh, my God, it's true.
Look at that! Look at that!

1061
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:25,516
He never danced like that with me.

1062
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:28,018
I'm gonna go talk to him.

1063
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:30,396
No! Sit!

1064
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:32,314
Why?

1065
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:34,567
I can't tell you.

1066
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:35,985
If I talk about it,

1067
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:38,737
gangster people will come
to my house and cut me.

1068
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:42,491
Oh.

1069
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:48,080
Oh, he almost looks like a fun person.

1070
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:52,585
(SOBBING) Must have been me.

1071
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:54,670
Was it me?

1072
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:57,006
No. Stop beating yourself up. It's him.

1073
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,716
Can we just get out of here? Now?

1074
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:00,759
(SNIFFLES) You know what they say...

1075
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:03,596
Once you go black, you never go back.

1076
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:05,931
(SOBBING)

1077
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,766
Can we get the check, please?

1078
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,059
(SNIFFLING)

1079
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:11,437
I feel like no one could feel

1080
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:13,606
I must be dreamin'

1081
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,983
I want this dream to be real

1082
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:18,235
I need this feelin'

1083
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:20,613
I make my wish upon a star

1084
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:24,116
And hope this night will last forever

1085
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:27,536
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

1086
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:28,829
Ain't nobody

1087
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:29,955
Nobody

1088
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:30,998
Loves me better

1089
00:53:31,082 --> 00:53:32,291
No one to love me

1090
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:33,459
Makes me happy

1091
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:34,627
Yeah

1092
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:36,754
Makes me feel this way

1093
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:38,631
Ain't nobody

1094
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,259
And that's why I worked so hard,

1095
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:45,429
so I could give Kate a good life,
then it backfired!

1096
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:47,348
Man, bitches don't care
nothin' about that shit.

1097
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:49,934
Oh, bitches do too care.

1098
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:51,685
I'm gonna tell you a secret...

1099
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:54,563
Sometimes I drive by our old house
and I just look at it

1100
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:57,483
and I just remember our life
and it just hurts!

1101
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,652
Man, that is so pathetic, P. Diddy.

1102
00:53:59,694 --> 00:54:00,986
- What?
- But you know what?

1103
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:02,947
- I'm gonna help you get her back.
- How?

1104
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:04,949
Well, first, we gotta create a mood.

1105
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:07,409
(ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING)

1106
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:09,787
- Just like at the restaurant, baby.
- Ooh.

1107
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:11,372
I'm already there.

1108
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:13,332
Yeah. Now, feel the Barry.

1109
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:14,667
(IN DEEP VOICE) Feel Barry White.

1110
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:16,126
- See?
- Talk like Barry.

1111
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:18,212
- Okay, that's Barry.
- Yeah.

1112
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:19,338
This is Kate.

1113
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:21,006
Hey, Kate. Yeah.

1114
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:23,008
I want you to talk nasty to her!

1115
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:25,010
Talk nasty!

1116
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:29,473
(SLURRED) I'd like to kiss you a lot.

1117
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:32,393
- Cut that sensitive shit, Nancy Boy!
- What?

1118
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:34,144
- You gotta be a beast!
- A beast!

1119
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:35,229
Yeah!

1120
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:36,981
In the bedroom, a woman wants a man

1121
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:38,899
that knows how to ride her
when she bucks.

1122
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:41,819
- Ride 'em when she bucks! Ride 'em!
- That's right.

1123
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:44,405
It's just... I can't.
It's a sculpture. I just can't.

1124
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:46,323
All right, okay.

1125
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:47,533
Use me, then.

1126
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:50,744
Huh?

1127
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:51,954
Damn it, grab these.

1128
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,247
- What?
- Grab 'em!

00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:54,623
Oh!

1130
00:54:57,585 --> 00:55:00,546
Oh, I get it, yeah.

1131
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:03,090
- Hey, Kate.
- Uh-huh.

1132
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:05,509
Yeah, you've been
waitin' for this for a while, huh?

1133
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,720
That's right.
Now, what you gonna do to her?

00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:09,763
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do!

1135

I'm gonna give you
an aromatherapy massage

No! Come on, now!

I'm gonna have
sexual intercourse, baby!

No, you... You a beast!
You need some of these.

- Now, grab 'em!

my tawdry little woman?

- Whoa!

- How about that, huh?
- (LAUGHS) Yeah!

1151
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:51,013
How would you like me
to pounce on you

- like a lion from above?
- I like it! I like it!

- Yo!
- That's what I'm talkin'!

1154
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:58,771
You ain't just no king of the jungle,
you own that jungle!

That's your pride!

1156

You own that jungle, and ain't no one

1157
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:03,317
gonna come around
and mess with your pride!

00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:06,320
That's right! I like that.

1160
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:08,947
Yeah! You ain't ready for that shit!
Come on, now!

1161
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:11,658
Be a beast! What you
gonna do when she starts ridin', huh?

1162
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:13,535
I'll take care of her!
That's what I'm gonna do!

- Uh-huh! Uh-huh!
- You're mine, Kate!

1164

- Ride that lightning rod!
- You don't need these no more.

What goes on in your personal life
is none of our business,

1169
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:37,017
but if it begins to affect the firm,
we need to call attention to it.

1170
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:41,271
Guys, we were moving a statue,
and we lost our footing, and we fell.

1171
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:45,359
My sister's under the impression
that you were humping your nanny.

1172
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:48,070
I was not humping my nanny!

1173
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:52,032
Peter, surely you understand
that if Mrs. Arness

1174
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:56,412
were to suspect any instability
on your part...

1175
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:59,998
There is no instability in my home.

1176
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,001
WIDOW: You sure
you can trust this guy?

1177
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:05,212
CHARLENE: Well, hey,
he's helping me reopen my case.

1178
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:07,047
Y'all got any leads?

1179
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:09,591
Well, a still from
the bank surveillance camera

1180
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:10,759
is on its way here,

1181
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:12,511
and we found a deposition
that could help.

1182
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,264
Well, that's cool, baby.

1183
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:19,393
If there's anything I can do to help,
anything, you just holler.

1184
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,438
I gotta run.

1185
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:26,150
Hey, Widow,
if you meant what you just said,

1186
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,193
it's not gonna be an easy job.

1187
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:31,363
WIDOW: I know it ain't.

1188
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:33,365
CHARLENE: I just gotta know
that if things get rough,

1189
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,742
you're not gonna run out on me.

1190
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:38,829
WIDOW: I've been
waitin' four years for this.

1191
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:40,205
I ain't gonna mess up.

1192
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:43,917
(CHUCKLES)

1193
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:50,174
Mmm.

1194
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:07,774
Ooh!

1195
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,359
Planning another heist?

1196
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:13,697
No. Why would you say that?

1197
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:15,240
I don't know.

1198
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,534
Maybe it was hearing
the words "job" and "hot"

1199
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:20,162
bandied between two tattooed people?

1200
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:24,333
Peter, that was just my old boyfriend
I told you about. Widow.

1201
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:26,251
He's just tryin' to get back with me.

1202
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:27,711
Mmm-hmm.

1203
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:29,922
I'm tellin' you the truth!

1204
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:31,965
Look, I just didn't want you to see him,

1205
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:36,178
because Widow,
he ain't been the best boyfriend,

1206
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:38,889
and I knew he'd be all over me.

1207
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:41,517

01:08:58,843 --> 01:09:00,718

1398
01:09:00,761 --> 01:09:03,763
Does it? Anyway, actually,
the den is closer...

1399
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:06,558
MRS. ARNESS:
Your table looks so inviting.

1400
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:09,811
Yes. It's too bad it's so small.

1401
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:11,813
Small?

1402
01:09:11,897 --> 01:09:14,190
Well, actually, it's big, isn't it?

1403
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:16,151
It's a big table, so...

1404
01:09:17,027 --> 01:09:18,653
There would be room for one more.

1405
01:09:18,737 --> 01:09:21,197
Oh, well, if it's not an imposition.

1406
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:22,907
Oh. Oh.

1407
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:25,368
Well, let me just go check
if there's enough food.

1408
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:26,703
(STAMMERING) I'm not... I'm not sure,

1409
01:09:26,745 --> 01:09:29,414
because, uh, actually,
this is the night of, uh,

1410
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:32,792
Yiminum, the, uh... The holiday where

1411
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:34,627
white people eat very little portions

1412
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:36,713
because that was
the night the Lord came down

1413
01:09:36,755 --> 01:09:38,339
and he was given food,

1414
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:40,133
and there was just too much
and he said, "No."

1415
01:09:40,217 --> 01:09:42,844
And so, he had a smaller portion,

1416
01:09:42,928 --> 01:09:44,429
and that's why
we might not have enough.

1417
01:09:45,222 --> 01:09:48,266
So, I'll just go check
on what the Lord would say.

1418
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:49,893

we can sign the contracts.

She was so wonderful.

1438

We paid her nothing,
of course, you know.

But then, people had standards
of service in those days.

1440
01:10:48,994 --> 01:10:51,120
And, of course, Ivy did know

1441

that you serve from the left
and collect from the right.

Is it some kind of herb like sage?

1482
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:53,785
No, it's sort of more like a milk of mint.

Go on and do your thing

2072
01:43:01,425 --> 01:43:02,884
Lately, itjust seems to me

2073
01:43:02,926 --> 01:43:05,386
That people ain't what they seem to be

2074
01:43:05,429 --> 01:43:06,929
They all want me torn up

2075
01:43:06,972 --> 01:43:08,264
I know they're snakes in the grass

2076
01:43:08,307 --> 01:43:10,141
So I pay my staff to keep the lawn cut

2077
01:43:10,225 --> 01:43:12,268
I see you, all the drama you bringin'

2078
01:43:12,352 --> 01:43:14,687
I combat that with positive thinkin'

2079
01:43:14,771 --> 01:43:17,356
I'm me till I'm old and gray
And when that day comes

2080
01:43:17,441 --> 01:43:19,942
I'm gonna teach my daughters
to be the same way

2081
01:43:19,985 --> 01:43:21,235
I am the way I am

2082
01:43:21,278 --> 01:43:23,237
I'm from the hood
So I'm crème de la crème

2083
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:26,240
Especially when y'all prayed
for my downfall

2084
01:43:26,283 --> 01:43:29,285
That's why I try to stay from around y'all

2085
01:43:29,328 --> 01:43:31,287
You'll never get me down

2086
01:43:31,330 --> 01:43:32,872
So I'll always be around

2087
01:43:32,956 --> 01:43:36,000
Still doin' me so beautifully

2088
01:43:36,084 --> 01:43:38,961
Go on and do your thing

2089
01:43:39,046 --> 01:43:41,339
'Cause people will talk

2090
01:43:41,423 --> 01:43:43,674
Baby, it's the way

2091
01:43:43,759 --> 01:43:45,801
The way that you walk

2092
01:43:45,886 --> 01:43:48,346
Keep your head up to the sky

2093
01:43:48,430 --> 01:43:50,848
Comfort is high

2094
01:43:50,933 --> 01:43:52,975
Love the ones that hate you

2095
01:43:53,060 --> 01:43:55,603
'Cause they're the ones who make you

2096
01:43:55,646 --> 01:43:57,647
Go on and do your thing

2097
01:43:57,731 --> 01:44:00,066
'Cause people will talk

2098
01:44:00,150 --> 01:44:02,318
Baby, it's the way

2099
01:44:02,402 --> 01:44:04,362
The way that you walk

2100
01:44:04,446 --> 01:44:07,281
Keep your head up to the sky

2101
01:44:07,324 --> 01:44:09,367
Comfort is high

2102
01:44:09,451 --> 01:44:11,661
Love the ones that hate you

2103
01:44:11,703 --> 01:44:14,247
'Cause they're the ones who make you

2104
01:44:14,331 --> 01:44:16,207
Go on and do your thing

2105
01:44:16,291 --> 01:44:20,086
Just do your thing 'cause
people gonna hate you anyway

2106
01:44:25,926 --> 01:44:27,635
Hip-hop music

2107
01:44:29,346 --> 01:44:31,013
- Take control
- Hip-hi-hop music

2108
01:44:31,098 --> 01:44:32,515
Oh, oh-oh-oh

2109
01:44:32,557 --> 01:44:34,892
Got to keep her sanity

2110
01:44:34,977 --> 01:44:37,353
I believe that one thing

2111
01:44:37,396 --> 01:44:40,273
Love will set you free

2112
01:44:40,357 --> 01:44:43,359
'Cause I believe in dreams

2113
01:44:43,443 --> 01:44:45,319
And you could come with me

2114
01:44:45,362 --> 01:44:47,029
If you want to

2115
01:44:47,114 --> 01:44:50,449
Got to keep her head up high

2116
01:44:50,534 --> 01:44:56,497
So I can make you understand my mind

2117
01:44:56,540 --> 01:44:58,749
Yeah, I'm free

2118
01:44:58,834 --> 01:45:01,627
Say, you could come with me, baby

2119
01:45:01,712 --> 01:45:03,838
If you want to

2120
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:05,548
Oh, oh-oh-oh

2121
01:45:05,632 --> 01:45:06,716
Say

2122
01:45:06,758 --> 01:45:08,217
Oh, oh-oh-oh

2123
01:45:08,260 --> 01:45:09,760
Clap, clap
