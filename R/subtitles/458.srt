1
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,900
<i>I don't wanna be a product
of my environment.</i>

2
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:48,714
<i>I want my environment
to be a product of me.</i>

3
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:54,182
<i>Years ago, we had the Church.</i>

4
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:58,983
<i>That was only a way
of saying we had each other.</i>

5
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,523
But now, I don't know.
It's a funny thing.

6
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:05,892
It put hate in your heart.

7
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:09,464
<i>The Knights of Columbus were
real head-breakers.</i>

8
00:01:09,637 --> 00:01:10,865
<i>True guineas.</i>

9
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:13,563
<i>They took over their piece of the city.</i>

10
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:20,140
<i>Twenty years after an Irishman couldn't get
a fucking job...</i>

11
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:24,444
<i>...we had the presidency.
May he rest in peace.</i>

12
00:01:25,086 --> 00:01:27,919
<i>That's what the niggers don't realize.</i>

13
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:32,355
<i>If I got one thing
against the black chappies, it's this:</i>

14
00:01:32,527 --> 00:01:34,654
<i>No one gives it to you.</i>

15
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,728
<i>You have to take it.</i>

16
00:01:58,186 --> 00:02:01,952
Vin, don't make me have
to come down here again for this.

17
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:04,614
Won't happen again, Mr. C.

18
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:11,060
Carmen's developing
into a fine young lady.

19
00:02:11,232 --> 00:02:13,325
You should be proud.

20
00:02:25,714 --> 00:02:28,706
You get your period yet, Carmen?

21
00:02:45,367 --> 00:02:46,834
You Johnny Sullivan's kid?

22
00:02:48,771 --> 00:02:52,002
- You live with your grandmother?
- Yeah.

23
00:02:52,307 --> 00:02:56,539
Vin, get him a couple loaves of bread,
couple half-gallons of milk.

24
00:02:56,712 --> 00:02:59,272
Do you like bologna and cheese?
Give him some cold cuts.

25
00:02:59,448 --> 00:03:04,010
Throw some mayo in.
You like comic books?

26
00:03:06,355 --> 00:03:07,879
You do good in school?

27
00:03:09,091 --> 00:03:13,027
- Yeah.
- That's good. I did too.

28
00:03:13,195 --> 00:03:15,789
They call that a paradox.

29
00:03:17,132 --> 00:03:20,898
Just keep it. Buy yourself some makeup.

30
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,670
You ever wanna earn a little extra money,
you come by L Street.

31
00:03:30,846 --> 00:03:33,542
You know where I am on L Street?

32
00:03:33,716 --> 00:03:35,343
Good.

33
00:03:35,517 --> 00:03:38,042
- Good boy.
- Thanks.

34
00:03:40,255 --> 00:03:43,986
To you, O Lord, we commend the soul
of Alphonsus, your servant.

35
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,151
In the sight of this world,
he is now dead.

36
00:03:46,328 --> 00:03:49,456
Forgive whatever sins he committed
through human weakness.

37
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,930
<i>- Amen.
- The Church wants you in your place.</i>

38
00:03:52,101 --> 00:03:54,661
Kneel, stand, kneel, stand.

39
00:03:54,837 --> 00:03:58,329
If you go for that sort of thing,
I don't know what to do for you.

40
00:03:58,507 --> 00:04:00,668
A man makes his own way.

41
00:04:00,844 --> 00:04:02,436
No one gives it to you.

42
00:04:02,611 --> 00:04:04,476
You have to take it.

43
00:04:06,481 --> 00:04:08,915
- James Joyce.
- Smart, Colin.

44
00:04:09,252 --> 00:04:11,550
Guineas from the North End,
down Providence...

45
00:04:11,721 --> 00:04:14,417
...tried to tell me what to do.

46
00:04:14,591 --> 00:04:18,357
And something maybe happened to them.

47
00:04:19,162 --> 00:04:22,529
Maybe like that:

48
00:04:28,972 --> 00:04:33,033
Jeez. She fell funny.

49
00:04:36,045 --> 00:04:38,445
Francis, you really should see somebody.

50
00:04:38,615 --> 00:04:41,914
<i>When you decide to be something,
you can be it.</i>

51
00:04:42,552 --> 00:04:45,350
That's what they don't tell you
in the Church.

52
00:04:45,522 --> 00:04:50,050
When I was your age, they would say
we could become cops or criminals.

53
00:04:50,226 --> 00:04:52,990
Today what I'm saying to you is this:

54
00:04:53,163 --> 00:04:56,724
When you're facing a loaded gun...

55
00:04:58,635 --> 00:05:00,865
...what's the difference?

56
00:05:03,506 --> 00:05:05,838
<i>That's my boy.</i>

57
00:05:06,376 --> 00:05:09,140
Terminal ballistics is the study
of a projectile...

58
00:05:09,313 --> 00:05:12,009
...as it hits a target
and the destruction that it causes.

59
00:05:12,182 --> 00:05:15,276
Take, for instance, what you carry,
9mm hollow-point.

60
00:05:15,452 --> 00:05:19,081
When the hollow-point hits the skull,
what happens is it mushrooms.

61
00:05:19,256 --> 00:05:22,123
<i>When it mushrooms it peels back.
So you may have six, eight...</i>

62
00:05:22,292 --> 00:05:25,455
...ten little particles
of the bullet that are like razor blades...

63
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:26,755
Sir, yes, sir!

64
00:05:26,931 --> 00:05:30,367
<i>...tearing their internal organs,
their liver, their lungs, their heart...</i>

65
00:05:30,534 --> 00:05:34,095
...bringing tissue, bone, blood,
brain matter, and that's called a blowback.

66
00:05:41,645 --> 00:05:44,170
Fuck you. Fucking queers.

67
00:05:44,348 --> 00:05:48,148
Firemen getting pussy for the first time
in the history of fire or pussy.

68
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:52,016
Hey, go save a kitten in a tree,
you fucking homos.

69
00:05:53,491 --> 00:05:54,981
Pencils.

70
00:06:00,798 --> 00:06:02,026
Begin.

71
00:06:09,773 --> 00:06:11,764
What are you looking at?

72
00:06:14,545 --> 00:06:15,978
Forget it.

73
00:06:16,147 --> 00:06:19,776
Your father was a janitor,
his son's only a cop.

74
00:06:22,653 --> 00:06:26,054
Those fucking firefighters are
a bunch of homos.

75
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,018
They are.

76
00:06:28,193 --> 00:06:31,754
So she tells me, "You never finish
anything. You finish the police course...

77
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:37,368
...you get taken care of again, baby."
So after graduation, I get a blowjob again.

78
00:06:37,535 --> 00:06:40,368
That's great.
Your mother must be a wonderful woman.

79
00:06:40,538 --> 00:06:41,562
Fuck yourself.

80
00:06:41,739 --> 00:06:44,105
Put it this way.
You're a black guy in Boston.

81
00:06:44,275 --> 00:06:46,835
You don't need any help from me
to be completely fucked.

82
00:06:47,012 --> 00:06:50,277
The Massachusetts State Police
has a long tradition of excellence.

83
00:06:50,615 --> 00:06:53,948
Your graduation today solidifies
your acceptance...

84
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:57,213
...into one of the finest law enforcement
agencies in our nation.

85
00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:01,155
As the governor of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts, I am confident...

86
00:07:01,326 --> 00:07:06,696
...each and every one of you will serve
with distinction, honor and integrity.

87
00:07:06,865 --> 00:07:08,799
Congratulations to all our new troopers.

88
00:07:08,967 --> 00:07:12,061
Thank you. You are dismissed.

89
00:07:22,647 --> 00:07:26,276
Sullivan, assigned to plainclothes right
out of the gate, congratulations.

90
00:07:26,451 --> 00:07:30,217
- We're going for a beer. You wanna come?
- No, I'll catch up with you guys.

91
00:07:39,097 --> 00:07:41,156
School's out.

92
00:07:42,901 --> 00:07:44,869
Thank you, Frank.

93
00:07:45,171 --> 00:07:46,661
You earned it.

94
00:07:46,838 --> 00:07:49,898
No more pencils, no more books.

95
00:07:52,611 --> 00:07:53,600
All right.

96
00:07:53,778 --> 00:07:55,302
<i>This is not the regular police...</i>

97
00:07:55,481 --> 00:07:57,381
<i>- ... this is the state police.
- And fire!</i>

98
00:07:57,582 --> 00:07:59,675
<i>Your training will
illustrate the difference.</i>

99
00:07:59,852 --> 00:08:02,548
State police, search warrant!
State police, open the door!

100
00:08:02,721 --> 00:08:04,086
<i>What's the difference?</i>

101
00:08:04,256 --> 00:08:06,656
<i>- Go, go, go!
- Sir, yes, sir!</i>

102
00:08:06,826 --> 00:08:09,886
<i>- Is that understood?
- Sir, yes, sir!</i>

103
00:08:10,061 --> 00:08:13,224
Move it, get the fuck down right now.
Get down, right now.

104
00:08:24,243 --> 00:08:27,144
Congratulations on passing
the detective's exam, and welcome...

105
00:08:27,313 --> 00:08:30,805
- ...to the Special Investigation Unit.
- Whoop-de-fucking-do.

106
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,850
We won't be working together,
that is, directly.

107
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:37,853
You'll be working for Captain Ellerby,
but I like to see everybody.

108
00:08:39,758 --> 00:08:42,522
You're a worker. You rise fast.

109
00:08:42,695 --> 00:08:44,686
Like a 12-year-old's dick.

110
00:08:46,265 --> 00:08:48,893
- Thank you, sergeant.
- My pleasure.

111
00:08:49,069 --> 00:08:51,435
- Thank you, sir.
- Good luck.

112
00:08:57,743 --> 00:09:00,837
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, hon.

113
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,641
You can go in there now.

114
00:09:11,925 --> 00:09:13,552
You can sit.

115
00:09:18,832 --> 00:09:20,231
So...

116
00:09:21,767 --> 00:09:24,167
Do you know what we do here?
My section?

117
00:09:26,439 --> 00:09:29,135
- Yes, sir, I have an idea...
- Let's say you have no idea...

118
00:09:29,342 --> 00:09:31,003
...and leave it at that, okay?

119
00:09:31,178 --> 00:09:33,669
No idea. Zip. None.

120
00:09:34,281 --> 00:09:37,773
If you had an idea what we do, we would
not be good at what we do, would we?

121
00:09:37,951 --> 00:09:39,475
We would be cunts.

122
00:09:39,653 --> 00:09:41,678
Are you calling us cunts?

123
00:09:41,855 --> 00:09:44,255
Staff Sergeant Dignam
has a style of his own.

124
00:09:44,424 --> 00:09:47,359
I'm afraid we all have to get used to it.

125
00:09:47,961 --> 00:09:51,988
So you have family connections down
in Southie, right? Through your father?

126
00:09:52,165 --> 00:09:54,690
Why don't you tell us
about your Uncle Jackie?

127
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:01,507
He was a carpet layer for Jordan Marsh.

128
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:05,974
Uncle Jackie was a small-time bookie
who tended bar at the Vets in Somerville.

129
00:10:06,146 --> 00:10:09,877
He got popped by Nicastro in '95.
We found his body out by the airport.

130
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,984
That's right.

131
00:10:14,487 --> 00:10:16,546
- I remember his funeral.
- Oh, good.

132
00:10:17,258 --> 00:10:18,953
Closed casket?

133
00:10:20,628 --> 00:10:22,391
That's right.

134
00:10:22,963 --> 00:10:24,931
So tell anybody up at Deerfield...

135
00:10:25,099 --> 00:10:28,227
Before you got kicked out for whaling
on a gym teacher with a chair.

136
00:10:28,402 --> 00:10:30,802
...you had an uncle met his demise
like that?

137
00:10:35,276 --> 00:10:36,743
I got a question.

138
00:10:36,911 --> 00:10:38,970
How fucked up are you?

139
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,384
Hi, Darlene.

140
00:10:54,595 --> 00:10:58,793
What you got, staff sergeant?
In no time you made sergeant.

141
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:03,770
- SIU. What a country.
- Perfect.

142
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,901
Hey, I don't mind going it alone.

143
00:11:08,075 --> 00:11:11,203
You know, if you went alone once
in a while you might get somewhere.

144
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,041
We're cops, all right?
This isn't somewhere.

145
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:18,951
All right, lookit, I know you're a worker.
Maybe I can do something for you.

146
00:11:19,453 --> 00:11:21,216
You got any suits,
or do you like...

147
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:24,223
...coming to work dressed like
you're gonna invade Poland?

148
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,224
You got quite the family tree.
That maggot uncle of yours...

149
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:32,765
...Tommy Costigan, is another goof.
He gets busted selling guns...

150
00:11:32,934 --> 00:11:35,960
...to federal officers, among many,
many, many other departures...

151
00:11:36,138 --> 00:11:39,471
- ...from our normative behavior.
- And what's this got to do with me?

152
00:11:39,641 --> 00:11:41,404
Why are you pretending to be a cop?

153
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:48,747
This unit is new, and you are
the newest members of it.

154
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:52,478
You have been selected for it
on the basis of intelligence and aptitude.

155
00:11:52,654 --> 00:11:55,748
This is an elite unit.

156
00:11:55,924 --> 00:12:00,190
Our job is to smash
or marginally disrupt...

157
00:12:00,362 --> 00:12:02,421
...organized crime in this city...

158
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:05,327
...by enhanced cooperation
with the FBI...

159
00:12:05,499 --> 00:12:08,263
...represented here today
by Agent Frank Lazio.

160
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:10,598
And we will do it.

161
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:14,230
And by organized crime in this city,
you know who we mean.

162
00:12:14,543 --> 00:12:16,704
That's Jackie Costigan.
That's an old picture.

163
00:12:16,878 --> 00:12:18,937
Jackie met his demise.

164
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:21,044
Last known photograph.

165
00:12:22,651 --> 00:12:24,676
Costello uses three key guys.

166
00:12:24,854 --> 00:12:28,381
That's Fitzy. Off-the-boat psycho,
lives in Brockton with his mother.

167
00:12:28,558 --> 00:12:31,254
<i>She's straight out of Going My Way.</i>

168
00:12:31,426 --> 00:12:33,519
Delahunt, muscle.

169
00:12:33,695 --> 00:12:37,654
French, the number one.
But of course, the rock star, you-know-who.

170
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,563
We've done a briefing book, so read up.
I want all ideas...

171
00:12:40,737 --> 00:12:42,898
...so I can pass them off as my own.

172
00:12:43,071 --> 00:12:46,199
Work hard, you'll rise fast.
You're in the best possible position...

173
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,138
...in the department.
Let's go to work.

174
00:12:48,344 --> 00:12:50,608
Your old man was a fucking hump
from Southie.

175
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:53,748
Baggage handler at the airport, right?

176
00:12:53,915 --> 00:12:56,383
Family's all criminals except
for the old man, huh?

177
00:12:56,552 --> 00:12:59,020
And one priest, since you seem
to know everything.

178
00:12:59,188 --> 00:13:03,056
Last I heard he was married to a 12-year-old
boy, living on a beach in Thailand.

179
00:13:03,226 --> 00:13:06,127
Fucking family's dug
into the Southie projects like ticks.

180
00:13:06,294 --> 00:13:08,592
Three-decker men at best.
You, however, grew up...

181
00:13:08,765 --> 00:13:12,633
...on the North Shore, huh?
Well, la-di-fucking-da.

182
00:13:12,802 --> 00:13:15,032
You were kind of a double kid,
I bet, right?

183
00:13:15,738 --> 00:13:18,138
One kid with your old man,
one kid with your mother.

184
00:13:18,307 --> 00:13:21,572
You're upper-middle class during the weeks,
then you're hanging...

185
00:13:21,744 --> 00:13:24,713
...in the Southie projects
with your daddy, the fucking donkey...

186
00:13:24,881 --> 00:13:27,372
...on the weekends. I got that right?

187
00:13:28,151 --> 00:13:31,314
Yup.
You have different accents?

188
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:34,379
You did, didn't you,
you little fucking snake?

189
00:13:34,557 --> 00:13:37,788
- You were like different people.
- You a psychiatrist?

190
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,929
If I was, I'd ask you
why you're a statie making 30 grand a year.

191
00:13:41,098 --> 00:13:44,590
And I think if I was Sigmund fucking Freud
I wouldn't get an answer.

192
00:13:44,768 --> 00:13:49,831
Tell me, what's a lace-curtain motherfucker
like you doing in the staties?

193
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,332
Well, families are always rising
or falling in America, am I right?

194
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:57,138
- Who said that?
- Hawthorne.

195
00:13:58,147 --> 00:14:01,605
What's the matter, smart-ass,
you don't know any fucking Shakespeare?

196
00:14:04,721 --> 00:14:06,951
We have a question.

197
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:12,789
Do you wanna be a cop,
or do you wanna appear to be a cop?

198
00:14:12,963 --> 00:14:14,260
It's an honest question.

199
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:18,093
Lot of guys want to appear to be cops.
Gun, badge, pretend they're on TV.

200
00:14:18,267 --> 00:14:20,895
A lot of them just wanna slam a nigger
through a window...

201
00:14:21,071 --> 00:14:23,869
I'm set without your
own personal job application, sergeant.

202
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,305
- What did you say?
- Sir, what do you want from me?

203
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:27,568
Hey, he can't help you.

204
00:14:27,744 --> 00:14:29,712
I know what you are.
I know what you are...

205
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:31,244
...and I know what you're not.

206
00:14:31,415 --> 00:14:34,851
I'm the best friend you have and I'm gonna
help you understand something.

207
00:14:35,018 --> 00:14:36,986
You're no fucking cop.

208
00:14:38,555 --> 00:14:41,683
He's right.
We deal in deception here.

209
00:14:41,859 --> 00:14:44,692
What we do not deal with
is self-deception.

210
00:14:44,862 --> 00:14:47,695
Five years from now you could be
anything else in the world.

211
00:14:47,865 --> 00:14:51,460
But you will not be
a Massachusetts state trooper.

212
00:14:52,135 --> 00:14:54,296
- Are you sure of that?
- I'm sure of that.

213
00:14:54,471 --> 00:14:55,563
Guaran-fucking-teed.

214
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:02,471
You had 1400 on your SATs, kid.
You're an astronaut, not a statie.

215
00:15:04,382 --> 00:15:06,577
You don't have much family.

216
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,245
I don't have any family.

217
00:15:13,891 --> 00:15:18,260
What's this I hear from Stephanie
about you becoming a policeman?

218
00:15:18,428 --> 00:15:21,363
Stephanie, who was the only one
who came to my father's funeral?

219
00:15:21,532 --> 00:15:24,933
- That Stephanie?
- Yeah, that Stephanie.

220
00:15:25,103 --> 00:15:28,937
- Nothing much to it, Uncle Edward.
- Trying to prove something to the family?

221
00:15:29,107 --> 00:15:34,101
When you say "the family,"
who do you mean exactly? You?

222
00:15:35,113 --> 00:15:37,513
You always have to question everything,
don't you?

223
00:15:37,681 --> 00:15:41,708
Maybe it would've done you some good
to have some questions from time to time.

224
00:15:41,885 --> 00:15:44,581
"Am I an asshole?
Are my kids a mess?

225
00:15:44,756 --> 00:15:49,455
Is my wife a money-grubbing whore?"
I mean, those are questions, right?

226
00:15:49,626 --> 00:15:54,393
"Have I ever been good to my dying sister,
or am I just now pretending to be?"

227
00:15:58,603 --> 00:16:01,538
Do you need some money for the funeral?

228
00:16:03,975 --> 00:16:07,570
When my mother dies,
we don't have any more connection.

229
00:16:08,112 --> 00:16:13,175
It's lovely. You get the high ceilings,
the parquet floors. Bathroom is massive.

230
00:16:13,351 --> 00:16:15,979
The fridge has got an alarm in it
in case you have...

231
00:16:16,154 --> 00:16:19,385
...eating issues, which is a joke.
Not a very funny one.

232
00:16:19,557 --> 00:16:23,516
Well, there's a great view of the
State House. Beacon Hill, you can see it.

233
00:16:24,129 --> 00:16:27,098
I mean, you move in,
you're upper-class by about Tuesday.

234
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,831
- So you're a cop.
- A state-police detective.

235
00:16:32,004 --> 00:16:33,835
A state-police detective.

236
00:16:34,439 --> 00:16:37,340
And are you a married
state-police detective?

237
00:16:37,575 --> 00:16:39,008
No.

238
00:16:39,945 --> 00:16:42,607
Because this is kind of a...
Sort of a big place and...

239
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,805
I have a co-signer.

240
00:16:45,184 --> 00:16:49,678
Oh, cool. Yeah, you intend
to have a houseguest. That's cool. Good.

241
00:16:49,854 --> 00:16:52,152
- Yeah, it's got...
- Just give me the papers.

242
00:16:53,092 --> 00:16:54,787
Sure.

243
00:16:55,260 --> 00:17:00,095
Eternal rest grant unto her, O Lord,
and let perpetual light shine upon her.

244
00:17:00,265 --> 00:17:02,790
- Amen.
- May she rest in peace. Amen.

245
00:17:02,968 --> 00:17:06,165
May her soul and the souls
of all the faithful departed...

246
00:17:06,338 --> 00:17:09,535
...through the mercy of God
rest in peace.

247
00:17:10,743 --> 00:17:12,506
Amen.

248
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:35,932
So what do I do?

249
00:17:36,269 --> 00:17:40,069
There's money behind this operation.
You won't be paid as a regular cop...

250
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,333
...but there's a bonus involved.

251
00:17:42,941 --> 00:17:44,841
Tax-free.

252
00:17:45,878 --> 00:17:50,747
We can't conceal that you were a trainee.
You'll be convicted of a crime.

253
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:54,647
We're thinking a guilty plea
to assault and battery would make sense.

254
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,878
Given your nature.

255
00:17:56,089 --> 00:17:59,058
You'll do enough jail time
to convince anyone this is no setup.

256
00:17:59,225 --> 00:18:01,750
You'll be on probation,
see a court-ordered shrink...

257
00:18:01,927 --> 00:18:03,622
...the whole nine yards.

258
00:18:05,098 --> 00:18:08,124
You wanna serve the Commonwealth,
this is your chance.

259
00:18:09,135 --> 00:18:10,659
We need you, pal.

260
00:18:10,837 --> 00:18:13,704
You've already pretended
to be a Costigan from South Boston.

261
00:18:13,872 --> 00:18:17,831
- Every weekend, sergeant.
- Perfect.

262
00:18:19,546 --> 00:18:21,343
Do it again.

263
00:18:22,515 --> 00:18:24,176
For me.

264
00:18:57,984 --> 00:19:01,420
- Hey, you Billy Costigan?
- Yeah, who wants to know?

265
00:19:01,588 --> 00:19:04,489
Well, nothing.
I know a Sean Costigan down on L Street.

266
00:19:04,658 --> 00:19:07,991
- Yeah, that's my cousin.
- Connected. Not too bright.

267
00:19:08,162 --> 00:19:10,824
- Yeah, I know.
- I mean, no offense.

268
00:19:27,848 --> 00:19:29,679
- Billy?
- Yeah, it's me.

269
00:19:29,849 --> 00:19:32,784
- Oh, my God. Good to see you.
- Aunt Kathy, how are you?

270
00:19:32,953 --> 00:19:35,945
Oh, good to see you. Come on in.

271
00:19:36,991 --> 00:19:40,290
They said you was in the staties.
I couldn't believe it.

272
00:19:40,461 --> 00:19:42,725
I got kicked out, like, four months ago.

273
00:19:42,897 --> 00:19:45,127
Yeah, it was in the papers.

274
00:19:46,967 --> 00:19:48,662
So you know.

275
00:19:48,836 --> 00:19:51,669
And why are we graced
with your presence?

276
00:19:52,173 --> 00:19:54,641
I brought your mother
some pictures of my father.

277
00:19:54,809 --> 00:19:57,937
- Look at the smile.
- My mother had them. My...

278
00:19:59,547 --> 00:20:00,741
My mother's dead.

279
00:20:02,249 --> 00:20:05,309
I'm sorry.
Sorry for your troubles.

280
00:20:05,486 --> 00:20:08,046
I was at a funeral myself, man.

281
00:20:08,824 --> 00:20:11,224
Myles Kennefick.
Knew him in school.

282
00:20:12,561 --> 00:20:15,655
He was a young guy, you know?
It's terrible. It's a shame.

283
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,991
- You remember that. What a night.
- Listen.

284
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:21,491
I got, like...

285
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:25,127
- Like 30,000 bucks, right? Insurance money.
- Yeah.

286
00:20:25,306 --> 00:20:28,070
You know, after my mother passed
and everything.

287
00:20:28,243 --> 00:20:30,905
In your line of work, if I gave you...

288
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:34,776
...like, what, say, 10,000,
what could I get back?

289
00:20:36,484 --> 00:20:38,315
You know what you...

290
00:20:38,485 --> 00:20:40,817
You know what you usually say
at these moments.

291
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:45,085
- What? What?
- Come on, man.

292
00:20:45,259 --> 00:20:49,161
Oh, come on, you fucking moron.
Come on.

293
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,957
What, you want me to say it?

294
00:20:54,736 --> 00:20:57,671
I'm not a cop, all right?

295
00:20:58,206 --> 00:21:02,006
- I'm your fucking cousin.
- You're bad.

296
00:21:02,911 --> 00:21:05,971
You corrupt fuck, man.
You must be my cousin.

297
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,709
Fucking Ricans think
they know everything.

298
00:21:10,886 --> 00:21:14,413
If they knew shit,
they wouldn't be Puerto Ricans.

299
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:18,059
<i>R is for Ricans
P is for pigs</i>

300
00:21:18,226 --> 00:21:21,320
Would you shut the fuck up
for five seconds, huh?

301
00:21:21,496 --> 00:21:24,465
That's right. You used to be a cop.

302
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:28,068
When we're working together
just limit it to two eight-balls an hour.

303
00:21:28,237 --> 00:21:31,695
We're not even supposed to be doing
this shit this close to Worcester.

304
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,307
This side of Worcester.

305
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:37,205
- Says who?
- Says him. Says Costello.

306
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,370
God says, as far as you're...

307
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,380
...concerned.

308
00:21:44,487 --> 00:21:47,422
No, no, he's no cop. He got out
of the joint three weeks ago.

309
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,956
- Cunt cop.
- No, no, no.

310
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:52,889
He talks like his shit don't stink,
but he's good people.

311
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:55,529
Well, I knew his father.

312
00:21:55,831 --> 00:21:58,425
- I liked his Uncle Jackie better.
- Jackie was all right.

313
00:21:58,601 --> 00:22:01,092
Uncle Jackie was excellent.

314
00:22:01,269 --> 00:22:03,237
Fucking guineas.

315
00:22:03,506 --> 00:22:05,906
- To Jackie.
- Uncle Jackie.

316
00:22:07,176 --> 00:22:09,167
Cranberry juice.

317
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,507
It's a natural diuretic.

318
00:22:12,682 --> 00:22:15,879
My girlfriend drinks it
when she's got her period.

319
00:22:16,686 --> 00:22:18,984
What, do you got your period?

320
00:22:23,192 --> 00:22:25,626
- Fucking...!
- Get off!

321
00:22:28,698 --> 00:22:32,429
- Get your fucking hands off me!
- Hey. Hey, hey.

322
00:22:33,903 --> 00:22:35,495
Do you know me?

323
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,534
No. No.

324
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:41,908
Well, I'm the guy that tells you
there are guys you can hit...

325
00:22:42,078 --> 00:22:44,069
...and there's guys you can't.

326
00:22:44,247 --> 00:22:46,238
Now, that's not quite a guy
you can't hit...

327
00:22:46,415 --> 00:22:48,679
...but it's almost a guy you can't hit.

328
00:22:48,852 --> 00:22:51,514
So I'm gonna make a fucking ruling
on this right now:

329
00:22:51,688 --> 00:22:54,714
You don't fucking hit him.
You understand?

330
00:22:57,526 --> 00:23:00,086
Yeah, excellent. Fine. Fine, fine.

331
00:23:01,597 --> 00:23:05,192
I fucking know you. I know your family.

332
00:23:05,735 --> 00:23:07,327
You make one more drug deal...

333
00:23:07,504 --> 00:23:10,337
...with that idiot fucking cop-magnet
of a cousin of yours...

334
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:13,803
...and I'll forget your grandmother was
so nice to me.

335
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:17,070
I'll cut your fucking nuts off.
You understand that?

336
00:23:18,749 --> 00:23:21,980
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

337
00:23:23,887 --> 00:23:25,411
What are you drinking?

338
00:23:32,262 --> 00:23:34,389
A cranberry juice.

339
00:23:35,732 --> 00:23:37,859
What is it, your period?

340
00:23:40,904 --> 00:23:44,135
Get him a cranberry juice.

341
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,705
Hey, fuckhead, that's Jackie's nephew.

342
00:23:54,317 --> 00:23:56,547
What? "Oh," fucking what?

343
00:24:00,358 --> 00:24:01,689
Get the fuck out of here.

344
00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:03,526
Sorry I'm late.

345
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:06,628
Staff Sergeant Dignam is our liaison
to the undercover section.

346
00:24:06,797 --> 00:24:08,389
His undercover work is extensive.

347
00:24:08,566 --> 00:24:10,796
He's here to give us his report.
Sergeant Dignam.

348
00:24:10,967 --> 00:24:13,197
Okay, my people are out there.

349
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,930
They're like fucking Indians.
You're not gonna see them.

350
00:24:16,107 --> 00:24:18,541
You'll hear about them
through me or Captain Queenan.

351
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:21,541
You will not ever know the identity
of undercover people.

352
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:24,646
Unfortunately, this shithole has more
leaks than the Iraqi navy.

353
00:24:24,816 --> 00:24:27,080
- Fuck yourself.
- I'm tired from fucking your wife.

354
00:24:27,251 --> 00:24:29,515
- How's your mother?
- Tired from fucking my father.

355
00:24:30,053 --> 00:24:31,520
Good. Today, girls...

356
00:24:31,689 --> 00:24:33,589
...what I have is microprocessors.

357
00:24:34,792 --> 00:24:38,091
Somebody, as you may already know,
stole 20 microprocessors...

358
00:24:38,262 --> 00:24:40,822
...from the Mass Processor Company
out on Route 128.

359
00:24:40,997 --> 00:24:43,261
These are the kind
they put into computers...

360
00:24:43,434 --> 00:24:46,267
...that could put a cruise missile
up the ass of a camel...

361
00:24:46,437 --> 00:24:48,268
...from a couple hundred miles away.

362
00:24:48,439 --> 00:24:51,272
These pieces of plastic are worth
about 100 grand apiece.

363
00:24:51,442 --> 00:24:54,002
We got a guy working
for the company two months...

364
00:24:54,178 --> 00:24:57,113
...walks out the door with
a box of processors on Tuesday...

365
00:24:57,281 --> 00:24:59,340
...has a ticket for Florida
on Wednesday...

366
00:24:59,517 --> 00:25:01,883
...but on Thursday, he gets found
in a Dumpster.

367
00:25:02,053 --> 00:25:04,214
You know where that dirtball
started his life?

368
00:25:04,388 --> 00:25:05,946
Southie projects.

369
00:25:06,124 --> 00:25:08,786
- What was his name, the departed?
- Myles Kennefick.

370
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,986
Got the job with a forged UMass
transcript. UMass, Boston...

371
00:25:12,163 --> 00:25:13,892
- ...which happens to...
- South Boston?

372
00:25:14,065 --> 00:25:17,125
Oh, you're a fucking genius.
Who forged your transcript, dickhead?

373
00:25:17,301 --> 00:25:20,498
His old man runs
the Hibernian Liquor Mart. Kennefick's.

374
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,400
We're not here to solve
the case of the missing scumbag.

375
00:25:25,576 --> 00:25:27,009
We're here to nail Costello.

376
00:25:27,178 --> 00:25:28,645
All right, look. We got a guy...

377
00:25:28,814 --> 00:25:31,339
...says Costello's moving
the processors to China.

378
00:25:31,517 --> 00:25:33,985
He set up the whole fucking job
and popped Kennefick.

379
00:25:34,152 --> 00:25:36,552
You do not want to miss it
if Costello takes a dump.

380
00:25:36,722 --> 00:25:40,158
We'd miss less if you made your
informants available to us and the Bureau.

381
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:44,056
Without asking for too many details,
do you have anyone in with Costello now?

382
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:46,828
Maybe. Maybe not.

383
00:25:46,999 --> 00:25:48,694
Maybe fuck yourself.

384
00:25:48,867 --> 00:25:51,199
My theory on Feds
is they're like mushrooms.

385
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:53,270
Feed them shit
and keep them in the dark.

386
00:25:53,437 --> 00:25:55,064
You girls have a good day.

387
00:25:55,874 --> 00:25:59,537
Normally he's a very nice guy.

388
00:25:59,711 --> 00:26:01,611
Don't judge him from this meeting alone.

389
00:26:04,683 --> 00:26:07,846
Now, Mrs. Kennefick, I knew your son.

390
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,749
I knew Myles.

391
00:26:09,922 --> 00:26:12,755
He was younger than me,
but he was behind me in school.

392
00:26:12,924 --> 00:26:15,085
I wanna get these people
who did this to him.

393
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:18,252
Would you like to help us?
You wanna help catch the people...

394
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:21,263
...who forced your son to do a robbery
and then killed him?

395
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,265
Allegedly.

396
00:26:24,203 --> 00:26:25,431
Allegedly.

397
00:26:25,604 --> 00:26:28,072
If he was killed,
he probably did something wrong.

398
00:26:28,241 --> 00:26:30,209
But not the robbery. That's not wrong.

399
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:32,434
He did something else wrong?

400
00:26:34,713 --> 00:26:37,739
Wave to your girlfriend, honey.

401
00:26:39,585 --> 00:26:41,780
I mean, fuck yourself.

402
00:26:43,423 --> 00:26:45,891
- Did you get that?
- "Allegedly" or "fuck yourself"?

403
00:26:46,058 --> 00:26:49,494
- Welcome to the neighborhood.
- Different breed down here, sarge.

404
00:26:50,996 --> 00:26:52,463
I need a cup of coffee.

405
00:27:06,212 --> 00:27:08,476
You making a house call?

406
00:27:09,114 --> 00:27:11,105
Have I seen you professionally?

407
00:27:11,284 --> 00:27:14,776
No, no. No, I know who you are, though.
I know.

408
00:27:14,954 --> 00:27:18,617
Guys gotta use their service revolver
in the course of duty...

409
00:27:18,791 --> 00:27:22,386
...and then they get to come to talk
to you about their feelings and whatnot.

410
00:27:22,562 --> 00:27:26,396
No, no, I know how it goes.
You're a mental health professional.

411
00:27:26,566 --> 00:27:28,227
I have an appointment on this floor.

412
00:27:28,401 --> 00:27:31,859
Oh, well, you'll have fun. They're all
frigging crazy on that floor.

413
00:27:32,038 --> 00:27:34,131
- I'm one more up.
- Oh, fancy policeman.

414
00:27:34,307 --> 00:27:36,400
- Yeah, that's right, fancy.
- Are you a statie?

415
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:39,704
Yeah, I am. I'm actually
going to law school also.

416
00:27:39,879 --> 00:27:41,176
Suffolk, nights?

417
00:27:41,347 --> 00:27:44,214
Yeah, they don't run Harvard
at night, last time I checked.

418
00:27:44,385 --> 00:27:47,877
- When's the last time you checked?
- Before I went to fucking Suffolk.

419
00:27:48,055 --> 00:27:50,819
Okay, listen, I went to UMass.
I wasn't insulting you.

420
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:53,652
Well, I thought you were.
So now you gotta buy me dinner.

421
00:27:53,826 --> 00:27:56,624
Maybe you can shoot someone
and then see me professionally.

422
00:27:56,797 --> 00:28:01,894
I'll stab someone in the heart with a fucking
ice pick if it gets me dinner with you.

423
00:28:02,068 --> 00:28:04,298
That's all right. I'm a detective.
I'll find you.

424
00:28:04,471 --> 00:28:07,497
No, sorry. I'm just joking.
I need the card. Card helps.

425
00:28:07,675 --> 00:28:09,165
Nice to meet you, Madolyn.

426
00:28:19,086 --> 00:28:22,783
Hi, Dad. I had no idea about the tail
until I saw it.

427
00:28:22,956 --> 00:28:25,789
No, I couldn't.
I had the other guy with me, I couldn't...

428
00:28:25,958 --> 00:28:29,086
All right, it's a blue sedan
and then a white van.

429
00:28:29,262 --> 00:28:32,390
It's fucked up with graffiti.
And the van is the audio surveillance.

430
00:28:32,566 --> 00:28:33,863
All right, have a nice day.

431
00:28:35,135 --> 00:28:36,864
Cut him here.

432
00:28:37,638 --> 00:28:39,105
Bye-bye.

433
00:28:43,344 --> 00:28:44,368
Jerk-ass!

434
00:28:44,545 --> 00:28:47,207
Come on, Babu. I can't do anymore.
I cannot hold off.

435
00:28:47,381 --> 00:28:50,908
Don't let me go back empty-handed.
Don't do this. I wanna help you.

436
00:28:51,085 --> 00:28:54,054
Come to my store next Friday.
I'll give you the money.

437
00:28:54,221 --> 00:28:56,712
This is Friday, Babu.
How many times I gotta tell you?

438
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:59,916
You keep on calling me Babu.
It's Singh, motherfucker.

439
00:29:00,094 --> 00:29:01,322
I'm trying to help you.

440
00:29:01,495 --> 00:29:04,931
You keep telling me I'm your friend.
You don't even know my fucking name.

441
00:29:05,099 --> 00:29:08,557
I'm gonna catch a beating if I go back
again like last week.

442
00:29:08,737 --> 00:29:12,195
See this guy? You see this guy?
This guy don't want you to have the money.

443
00:29:12,374 --> 00:29:15,207
Because he wants to come back there
and squash your head.

444
00:29:15,376 --> 00:29:17,810
I have one customer sitting here.
What I'm gonna do?

445
00:29:17,978 --> 00:29:20,845
Business is bad? You opened a store
in an Irish neighborhood.

446
00:29:21,014 --> 00:29:23,244
These are dirty people.
Don't you know that?

447
00:29:23,418 --> 00:29:25,648
Sell potatoes,
I don't know what you're gonna do.

448
00:29:25,819 --> 00:29:28,913
- Excuse me, gentlemen. Excuse me. Sorry.
- Know what I'm saying?

449
00:29:29,089 --> 00:29:30,613
You fellas come from Providence?

450
00:29:30,792 --> 00:29:32,851
It isn't any of your business, is it, now?

451
00:29:33,026 --> 00:29:35,551
What, are you fucking delivering
cannolis or something?

452
00:29:45,406 --> 00:29:48,569
Hey! You are killing my business, man!

453
00:29:49,309 --> 00:29:50,503
Fuck!

454
00:29:50,678 --> 00:29:53,841
What's wrong with this fucking country?
Everybody hates everybody!

455
00:29:59,187 --> 00:30:01,121
Get out of here. Get out of here!

456
00:30:07,762 --> 00:30:11,459
- Now, you also do probation work, right?
- That's right, I see violent offenders.

457
00:30:11,633 --> 00:30:15,694
- Oh, bad guys.
- Not necessarily.

458
00:30:21,409 --> 00:30:24,344
Yeah, they got this but they don't got
duck I'orange.

459
00:30:24,513 --> 00:30:26,071
Was your meal okay?

460
00:30:26,247 --> 00:30:27,805
Yeah, no, the lobster was good.

461
00:30:27,983 --> 00:30:31,384
I just, you know, because it was
a French restaurant I was surprised.

462
00:30:37,091 --> 00:30:38,888
I'm waiting for you to make your move.

463
00:30:39,061 --> 00:30:41,996
Look, I don't know, if that thing moves,
I'm gonna shoot it.

464
00:30:42,163 --> 00:30:43,528
I don't even know what it is.

465
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,638
So what's it like having people
find themselves...

466
00:30:53,808 --> 00:30:55,673
...in your office all day long?

467
00:30:55,845 --> 00:30:58,473
Does it get messy with all those
feelings flying around?

468
00:30:59,815 --> 00:31:02,181
Why, does that make you
uncomfortable?

469
00:31:02,351 --> 00:31:03,750
- No, no, no.
- No?

470
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:06,251
No, no, no. No, I'm not on your couch.

471
00:31:07,623 --> 00:31:09,818
Well, you know what Freud said
about the Irish?

472
00:31:09,992 --> 00:31:11,391
Yeah, I do.

473
00:31:11,961 --> 00:31:14,725
Yeah, if you actually do,
I'll see you again.

474
00:31:15,698 --> 00:31:18,531
Who says I wanna see you again?

475
00:31:22,404 --> 00:31:24,167
Don't you?

476
00:31:25,908 --> 00:31:27,808
- You should see your face.
- Don't you?

477
00:31:27,977 --> 00:31:29,410
Course I wanna see you again.

478
00:31:30,112 --> 00:31:32,137
What Freud said about the Irish is...

479
00:31:32,315 --> 00:31:36,581
...we're the only people who are
impervious to psychoanalysis.

480
00:31:37,553 --> 00:31:39,885
- Yeah, he said that.
- I know he did.

481
00:31:40,056 --> 00:31:43,219
So you're up shit's creek with a
client list full of mick cops.

482
00:31:43,392 --> 00:31:45,383
I mean, opening up? Good luck to you.

483
00:31:45,561 --> 00:31:47,722
Why do you do it, then?

484
00:31:48,931 --> 00:31:51,058
Some people do get better.

485
00:31:54,069 --> 00:31:55,400
Fair enough.

486
00:31:55,572 --> 00:31:59,269
Sometimes I want people to forget
their personal bullshit and do their jobs.

487
00:32:00,243 --> 00:32:01,471
Including the criminals?

488
00:32:01,644 --> 00:32:03,908
If they don't do their jobs,
you don't have one.

489
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,808
I'll always have a job.
I'll just arrest innocent people.

490
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:11,812
- Wait. You are trouble.
- You don't know the half of it.

491
00:32:11,988 --> 00:32:14,081
I'll arrest you right now.

492
00:32:15,292 --> 00:32:17,192
<i>My word against yours.</i>

493
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,287
...then I see her dancing at the wedding
with you-know-who.

494
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:24,499
I say, "Why don't you
go to Parents Without Partners?"

495
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:28,694
He goes, "Ma, they're all losers
at the Parents Without Partners," so...

496
00:32:31,374 --> 00:32:33,774
So I say to him,
"Princess Carolina of Monaco..."

497
00:32:36,479 --> 00:32:37,810
Schuyler.

498
00:32:51,494 --> 00:32:53,792
Do you know who I am?

499
00:32:57,033 --> 00:32:58,557
No.

500
00:33:02,572 --> 00:33:06,906
You met my friend Mr. French
the other night.

501
00:33:17,053 --> 00:33:19,578
His real name Mr. French?

502
00:33:22,493 --> 00:33:24,154
No.

503
00:33:27,765 --> 00:33:29,733
Come with me.

504
00:33:34,271 --> 00:33:38,537
I'm not the cops. I'm not asking you.

505
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:45,206
You know something, they just do not stop
having the Mafia in Providence.

506
00:33:45,383 --> 00:33:49,251
And this can cause me a lot of problems.

507
00:33:55,292 --> 00:33:58,159
Those guys you tuned up...

508
00:33:58,329 --> 00:34:00,490
...they're connected down Providence.

509
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:03,398
What they're gonna do...

510
00:34:03,567 --> 00:34:07,162
...is come back with some guys
and kill you.

511
00:34:07,338 --> 00:34:10,364
Which, sure as you're born,
they will do.

512
00:34:10,541 --> 00:34:12,941
Unless I stop them.

513
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:15,178
Do you want me to stop them?

514
00:34:18,315 --> 00:34:20,545
Is this something I can't do personally?

515
00:34:24,423 --> 00:34:26,220
I'm gonna have my associate search you.

516
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:28,688
No one's searching me.
Search me for what?

517
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:31,589
Contra-fucking-band.
Take your shoes off.

518
00:34:32,164 --> 00:34:33,631
Shoes.

519
00:34:40,272 --> 00:34:41,762
I knew your father.

520
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:48,073
Yeah? Do you know he's dead?

521
00:34:48,946 --> 00:34:51,915
Oh, sorry. How'd he go?

522
00:34:52,683 --> 00:34:55,743
- Stand.
- He didn't complain.

523
00:34:55,921 --> 00:34:58,651
Yeah, that was his problem.

524
00:34:59,291 --> 00:35:00,656
Who said he had a problem?

525
00:35:02,961 --> 00:35:05,486
I just said he had a fucking problem.

526
00:35:06,798 --> 00:35:09,130
There's a man could've been anything.

527
00:35:09,301 --> 00:35:11,701
Are you trying to say
that he was nothing?

528
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:15,306
- Fuck.
- I'm saying he worked at the airport.

529
00:35:15,474 --> 00:35:17,339
- He's clean.
- Arm.

530
00:35:17,509 --> 00:35:18,771
Yeah, come on.

531
00:35:18,944 --> 00:35:20,468
What arm? What fucking arm?

532
00:35:20,645 --> 00:35:23,978
Show me your arm. Flip it.

533
00:35:30,789 --> 00:35:34,316
Makes me curious to see you
in this neighborhood.

534
00:35:36,062 --> 00:35:37,393
He's clean.

535
00:35:37,562 --> 00:35:40,827
And if I can slander my own
environment...

536
00:35:40,999 --> 00:35:44,799
...it makes me sad, this regression.

537
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:49,930
Plus, I don't know if it's beyond some
fucking cop prick like Queenan...

538
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:54,408
...to pull you out of the staties
and send you after me.

539
00:35:55,148 --> 00:35:57,514
I just can't know.

540
00:35:57,983 --> 00:36:02,181
I don't know what they do
in that particular department, anyway.

541
00:36:03,489 --> 00:36:06,583
- Are you still a cop?
- No! No!

542
00:36:07,126 --> 00:36:10,095
Swear on your mother's grave
you're still not a cop?

543
00:36:10,263 --> 00:36:13,096
I am not a fucking cop!

544
00:36:14,033 --> 00:36:18,936
Are you gonna stop doing coke deals
with your jerkoff fucking cousin?

545
00:36:19,105 --> 00:36:22,233
Yes. Yes, yes.

546
00:36:23,309 --> 00:36:25,436
All right, all right, all right.

547
00:36:25,611 --> 00:36:28,409
You're okay. You'll be all right.

548
00:36:28,948 --> 00:36:31,815
Get your hand taken care of.

549
00:36:32,885 --> 00:36:37,447
I'm sorry, but it was necessary.

550
00:36:38,724 --> 00:36:42,353
As for our problem with Providence...

551
00:36:43,196 --> 00:36:45,994
...let's not cry over spilled guineas.

552
00:36:48,534 --> 00:36:51,503
Who let this IRA motherfucker in my bar?

553
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:59,107
Just kidding. How's your mother?

554
00:37:00,047 --> 00:37:01,514
She's on her way out.

555
00:37:01,681 --> 00:37:04,741
We all are. Act accordingly.

556
00:37:05,051 --> 00:37:07,281
Here it is, Your Highness, as ordered.

557
00:37:07,454 --> 00:37:09,615
Get in the car.
I wanna show you something.

558
00:37:09,789 --> 00:37:12,883
- What's got you all hot and bothered?
- Get in the car. You'll see.

559
00:37:13,759 --> 00:37:16,387
Do you trust him?

560
00:37:17,029 --> 00:37:18,257
Well, these days...

561
00:37:18,999 --> 00:37:20,557
...who's reliable?

562
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,068
His Uncle Jackie was.

563
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:28,230
Yeah, but you can't trust a guy
acts like he's got nothing to lose.

564
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:34,876
I'm reliable.

565
00:37:35,682 --> 00:37:39,118
Arnold, you're one in a million.

566
00:37:39,286 --> 00:37:41,948
Ten. Ten million.

567
00:37:43,891 --> 00:37:46,587
What about your wife, Arnold?

568
00:37:49,096 --> 00:37:50,654
Well, I thought she was.

569
00:37:52,132 --> 00:37:53,929
She wasn't.

570
00:37:56,237 --> 00:37:58,102
Well, she got reliable.

571
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:03,234
Don't you people ever shut the fuck up?

572
00:38:04,412 --> 00:38:06,437
Another county heard from.

573
00:38:06,613 --> 00:38:08,342
One too many. She got a big mouth.

574
00:38:08,515 --> 00:38:10,608
Answer this for me, will you?

575
00:38:31,439 --> 00:38:35,000
The principles of detection tell me
these two gentlemen came from Providence.

576
00:38:35,176 --> 00:38:38,873
Lieutenant Risteen, Lynn PD. I'd appreciate
it you get out of my crime scene.

577
00:38:39,047 --> 00:38:41,811
Yeah, actually, it's my crime scene,
but knock yourself out.

578
00:38:41,983 --> 00:38:43,450
Thanks.

579
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:49,948
I saw a dead guy. I think I'm having
posttraumatic stress.

580
00:38:50,124 --> 00:38:51,921
Can I meet you for lunch?

581
00:38:52,093 --> 00:38:53,355
All right, see you then.

582
00:38:57,799 --> 00:38:59,562
Who's the lead detective?

583
00:38:59,734 --> 00:39:02,567
Good. He's a lox.

584
00:39:10,712 --> 00:39:14,808
Get the cops to look at Jimmy Pappas for
the hit. He had nothing to do with it...

585
00:39:14,983 --> 00:39:16,712
<i>...and he'll say so.</i>

586
00:39:16,884 --> 00:39:21,184
Look in his car, you'll find the gun that
did it, registered, official. Providence.

587
00:39:21,356 --> 00:39:23,551
In the trunk or the glove compartment?

588
00:39:24,859 --> 00:39:26,884
Hey, you wanna see some dead guys?

589
00:39:32,201 --> 00:39:34,829
Hey, this will get Captain Ellerby
on the 6:00 news.

590
00:39:35,004 --> 00:39:36,301
No wonder you get ahead.

591
00:39:42,511 --> 00:39:44,536
Have a seat, Bill.

592
00:39:52,254 --> 00:39:54,688
Do you know John Lennon?

593
00:39:55,791 --> 00:39:58,851
Yeah, sure, he was the president
before Lincoln.

594
00:40:01,397 --> 00:40:03,524
Lennon said:

595
00:40:04,266 --> 00:40:05,961
"I'm an artist.

596
00:40:06,135 --> 00:40:10,538
You give me a fucking tuba,
I'll get you something out of it."

597
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:16,141
I tell you, Mr. Costello...

598
00:40:16,311 --> 00:40:19,576
...I'd like to squeeze
some fucking money out of it.

599
00:40:27,056 --> 00:40:29,354
Smart-mouth.

600
00:40:30,292 --> 00:40:32,192
Too bad.

601
00:40:33,395 --> 00:40:35,693
If you'll indulge me...

602
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:38,588
Now what?

603
00:40:40,136 --> 00:40:42,070
Choir practice.

604
00:40:43,105 --> 00:40:44,436
Choir practice...

605
00:40:49,278 --> 00:40:51,712
The point I'm making
with John Lennon is...

606
00:40:52,848 --> 00:40:56,614
...a man could look at anything...

607
00:40:56,819 --> 00:40:58,446
...and make something out of it.

608
00:40:58,621 --> 00:41:00,088
For instance...

609
00:41:00,256 --> 00:41:02,656
...I look at you and I think:

610
00:41:03,593 --> 00:41:05,993
What could I use you for?

611
00:41:08,331 --> 00:41:09,992
Get rid of this.

612
00:41:10,166 --> 00:41:11,656
French.

613
00:41:11,835 --> 00:41:14,303
<i>Put it downstairs. Here.
Go ahead, thank you.</i>

614
00:41:14,471 --> 00:41:16,166
Maybe we could work something out.

615
00:41:17,005 --> 00:41:20,304
- Good.
- And send this to his wife.

616
00:41:20,476 --> 00:41:22,444
It was nice the way
you asked the guy...

617
00:41:22,612 --> 00:41:24,842
...which hand he jerked off with.

618
00:41:25,482 --> 00:41:26,949
I hope this don't shake Rita up.

619
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:30,784
As I remember,
she ain't that sentimental.

620
00:41:38,895 --> 00:41:41,659
That was quick.
You think he's dead already?

621
00:41:42,465 --> 00:41:44,524
<i>We have to do it by phone.
I won't do it...</i>

622
00:41:44,701 --> 00:41:46,965
...if I have to wear a wire.
No wires. Understand?

623
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:49,537
<i>- You don't know what this is like.
- Microprocessors.</i>

624
00:41:49,706 --> 00:41:52,004
<i>- Micro what?
- Microprocessors.</i>

625
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:55,043
We'll probably be at war
with the Chinese in 20-odd years...

626
00:41:55,211 --> 00:41:58,146
...and Costello is selling them
military technology.

627
00:41:58,314 --> 00:42:00,714
Microprocessors, chips, computer parts.

628
00:42:00,884 --> 00:42:03,148
<i>Anybody says anything about
anything like that...</i>

629
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,309
...you let us know.

630
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:10,487
So who did the two guys
from Providence?

631
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:13,158
Jimmy Pappas.

632
00:42:13,329 --> 00:42:15,320
What happened to Jimmy Pappas?

633
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:18,794
Jimmy had a rough month.

634
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,300
Jimmy had a heart attack in jail...

635
00:42:21,471 --> 00:42:24,668
...and then he got himself knifed
at Boston City Hospital.

636
00:42:24,841 --> 00:42:26,672
I believe it's been in the papers.

637
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:29,879
You seem quite happy with that result.

638
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:33,042
It's a fucking result.

639
00:42:33,216 --> 00:42:36,481
Yeah, but cui bono? Who benefits?

640
00:42:36,653 --> 00:42:39,679
Cui gives a shit?
It's got a frigging bow on it.

641
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:44,925
I think you are a cop, my son.

642
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,257
- Where's your license?
- What license?

643
00:42:48,431 --> 00:42:51,366
I don't see none. There's no such thing
as a license, of course.

644
00:42:51,535 --> 00:42:54,663
But you, you definitely need
to have fucking one.

645
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:58,239
If you're not being run by us,
you're being run by someone else.

646
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,934
That means you're bringing
undesirable elements...

647
00:43:01,111 --> 00:43:03,045
...into Mr. Costello's area.

648
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,979
I was going for my fucking cigarettes!

649
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:12,179
Hey.

650
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:15,455
That's Jimmy Bags.

651
00:43:19,631 --> 00:43:22,361
- He was rea... I don't know.
- What the fuck you doing?

652
00:43:23,501 --> 00:43:25,162
I'm in the hole,
I pay him two grand.

653
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:27,133
There's no profit, I pay him two grand.

654
00:43:27,305 --> 00:43:29,205
Then make more money.
This is America.

655
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:32,672
You don't make money, you're
a douche bag. Now what you gonna do?

656
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:35,471
- Make more money.
- That's the spirit!

657
00:43:35,647 --> 00:43:37,740
- Oh, fuck.
- Don't worry about it.

658
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:40,440
The guy don't need
any fucking teeth anyway.

659
00:43:40,651 --> 00:43:43,745
It's a small surveillance subunit,
but it's mine.

660
00:43:43,922 --> 00:43:46,789
I didn't take this job to fuck up
or let anyone else fuck up.

661
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:51,190
I handpicked this group.
You're my A team. Now, our prim...

662
00:43:51,997 --> 00:43:53,089
Hi, Captain.

663
00:43:53,265 --> 00:43:54,459
This crazy fuck...

664
00:43:54,633 --> 00:43:56,760
- ...knocked Jimmy Bags' teeth out.
- So?

665
00:43:56,935 --> 00:43:59,028
- He was...
- He was reaching for his cigarettes.

666
00:43:59,204 --> 00:44:02,037
You're gonna give me shit?
It wasn't for no reason, Frank.

667
00:44:02,207 --> 00:44:03,469
He reached into his coat.

668
00:44:03,642 --> 00:44:05,872
I don't know if he's a bookie
or what he's doing.

669
00:44:06,044 --> 00:44:08,478
Well, you do know
what a bookie does, don't you?

670
00:44:08,647 --> 00:44:10,706
Yeah. Yeah, he pays you.

671
00:44:10,882 --> 00:44:13,146
Queenan's compartmentalizing
everything in SIU...

672
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:14,649
...which is the right thing.

673
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:17,447
I don't trust half the troopers
out there anymore.

674
00:44:17,956 --> 00:44:19,856
Bottom line...

675
00:44:20,026 --> 00:44:22,119
...we think we might have a problem.

676
00:44:22,294 --> 00:44:25,161
We think Costello's got a rat
in the state police.

677
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:29,231
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

678
00:44:29,401 --> 00:44:31,699
Do we have direct access
to Queenan's undercovers?

679
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:34,465
No, no, not presently.

680
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:36,072
But I'm working on that.

681
00:44:36,241 --> 00:44:38,368
Here, Bill, this is for you.

682
00:44:39,045 --> 00:44:42,674
From now on, call the bar,
ask for Mikey. Just Mikey.

683
00:44:42,848 --> 00:44:46,340
You ask for Mikey
because there is no Mikey.

684
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:49,417
You wait. We'll call you.

685
00:44:49,587 --> 00:44:51,248
- You got that?
- Yeah, I got that.

686
00:44:51,424 --> 00:44:54,359
- Sorry, I didn't hear you.
- I got that.

687
00:44:54,527 --> 00:44:56,154
Good.

688
00:44:57,662 --> 00:44:59,527
Hi, Dad.

689
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:02,495
I got promoted. All right.

690
00:45:20,052 --> 00:45:22,020
Excuse me for one second.

691
00:45:23,122 --> 00:45:24,919
You know...

692
00:45:26,192 --> 00:45:28,558
...if your father were alive...

693
00:45:28,728 --> 00:45:30,787
...and saw you here sitting with me...

694
00:45:30,963 --> 00:45:33,227
...let's say he'd have a word with me
about this.

695
00:45:33,399 --> 00:45:36,197
In fact, he'd kill seven guys
just to cut my throat.

696
00:45:36,369 --> 00:45:38,599
And he could do it...

697
00:45:39,205 --> 00:45:43,073
...which is maybe something
you don't know about William Costigan Sr.

698
00:45:47,848 --> 00:45:52,444
- So he never...? I mean, never?
- No. No, no.

699
00:45:52,618 --> 00:45:56,110
He kept his own counsel.
He never wanted money.

700
00:45:56,288 --> 00:45:58,586
You can't do anything
with a man like that.

701
00:45:59,659 --> 00:46:01,286
Your Uncle Jackie...

702
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:06,227
...he also would kill my entire fucking
family if he saw me here with you.

703
00:46:08,234 --> 00:46:10,828
And I think about this.

704
00:46:16,742 --> 00:46:19,438
So what the fuck
are we talking about here?

705
00:46:20,246 --> 00:46:23,147
Did you ever think about
going back to school?

706
00:46:23,316 --> 00:46:25,341
School?

707
00:46:27,354 --> 00:46:30,084
With all due respect, Mr. Costello...

708
00:46:30,257 --> 00:46:32,350
...school is out.

709
00:46:33,093 --> 00:46:35,857
Maybe someday
you'll wake the fuck up.

710
00:46:37,664 --> 00:46:38,926
Good day, Fathers.

711
00:46:40,132 --> 00:46:43,101
- Mr. Costello.
- Good morning, Francis, good morning.

712
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:45,932
You recall our chat?

713
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:48,332
Little boys...

714
00:46:48,775 --> 00:46:52,939
...sucking on their peckers,
et cetera and so forth...

715
00:46:53,547 --> 00:46:55,947
"I am as God made me."
Was that your rationale?

716
00:46:58,018 --> 00:47:03,354
May I remind you, in this archdiocese,
God don't run the bingo.

717
00:47:03,524 --> 00:47:07,551
May I remind you
that pride comes before the fall.

718
00:47:10,063 --> 00:47:13,032
How's Sister Mary Theresa doing?

719
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,601
We had a tasty relationship
before she took her vows.

720
00:47:17,404 --> 00:47:19,565
Enjoy your clams, cocksuckers.

721
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:21,435
Pay them.

722
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:25,804
Get the old bombardier a drink
on the house.

723
00:47:32,619 --> 00:47:35,747
- What do you got for me?
- Uniform clipped him for suspended license.

724
00:47:35,923 --> 00:47:38,289
However, he's a subject of
an open investigation...

725
00:47:38,459 --> 00:47:40,393
More than one. He's one of Costello's.

726
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:43,120
We're getting a warrant.
Can't get an address off him.

727
00:47:43,297 --> 00:47:45,959
He paged his lawyer but
the lawyer hasn't called back yet.

728
00:47:46,133 --> 00:47:48,761
- Who's the lawyer?
- Didn't know the name. Just a number.

729
00:47:49,504 --> 00:47:50,903
Beeper number.

730
00:47:51,606 --> 00:47:53,904
- And the guy didn't show up?
- No.

731
00:47:54,976 --> 00:47:57,274
- And he beeped him?
- Twice.

732
00:48:01,516 --> 00:48:03,984
Give me your phone. Turn that off.

733
00:48:04,151 --> 00:48:06,278
- What?
- Turn the fucking camera off.

734
00:48:06,787 --> 00:48:09,881
Give it to me. He doesn't know
what the fucking lawyer looks like.

735
00:48:10,057 --> 00:48:12,116
Whose briefcase is this? All right.

736
00:48:12,293 --> 00:48:13,555
- It's off?
- You're good.

737
00:48:13,728 --> 00:48:16,390
Afternoon, Mr. Fitzgibbons.

738
00:48:16,697 --> 00:48:18,892
- He can't do that.
- He just did.

739
00:48:19,066 --> 00:48:22,524
- You my attorney?
- What do you think?

740
00:48:23,705 --> 00:48:25,696
Have you made statements
or phone calls...

741
00:48:25,873 --> 00:48:27,534
...I need to be made aware of?

742
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:32,238
I beeped you.

743
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,540
The card they gave me. That's it.

744
00:48:35,717 --> 00:48:39,118
- That's it?
- That's it.

745
00:48:42,324 --> 00:48:43,757
You need to call your mother...

746
00:48:43,926 --> 00:48:46,224
...tell her you're not gonna be home
for supper.

747
00:48:50,933 --> 00:48:54,460
Camera's off.
It's off. Call your mother.

748
00:48:57,739 --> 00:49:01,072
Lookit, they're suiting up for a raid
right now.

749
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:04,837
I don't know where they're going,
but they do. And so do you.

750
00:49:06,848 --> 00:49:08,372
So make the call.

751
00:49:13,021 --> 00:49:16,479
Lookit, fuckstick,
you don't gotta trust me...

752
00:49:17,893 --> 00:49:20,555
...just listen to what I'm saying to you.

753
00:49:37,346 --> 00:49:41,840
Mom, I'm not gonna make it home
for supper.

754
00:49:42,017 --> 00:49:43,951
<i>Sorry, yeah, I got held up.</i>

755
00:49:45,487 --> 00:49:48,422
Yeah, no, you carry on without me.

756
00:49:49,458 --> 00:49:52,689
I'll talk to you later. Okay.

757
00:49:52,861 --> 00:49:54,624
Bye.

758
00:49:54,831 --> 00:49:58,028
Everybody out. Move.

759
00:50:15,151 --> 00:50:16,379
Thank you.

760
00:50:17,687 --> 00:50:19,120
So who are you?

761
00:50:19,288 --> 00:50:22,724
I think you need a different attorney,
Mr. Fitzgibbons. Have a great day.

762
00:50:22,892 --> 00:50:24,553
So when the fuck am I gonna get out?

763
00:50:24,727 --> 00:50:28,060
All right, run the last number he called.
That's his house.

764
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:30,926
I'll swear to the judge
I surveilled him there...

765
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:33,193
...and abra-fucking-cadabra,
we got a warrant.

766
00:50:33,369 --> 00:50:36,736
- Why did you use my phone?
- Because you didn't go in there.

767
00:50:47,851 --> 00:50:49,716
The light's nice here in the morning.

768
00:50:54,691 --> 00:50:57,319
So do you wanna talk about last night?

769
00:51:03,967 --> 00:51:07,494
You know, it's all right. Guys tend to make
too big a deal out of it.

770
00:51:13,076 --> 00:51:15,010
It's actually quite common.

771
00:51:15,179 --> 00:51:16,771
I gotta go to work.

772
00:51:25,989 --> 00:51:27,820
Do you lie?

773
00:51:29,226 --> 00:51:31,717
Why? Do you?

774
00:51:31,895 --> 00:51:33,590
No, I'm asking if you lie.

775
00:51:34,665 --> 00:51:37,065
Honesty is not synonymous with truth.

776
00:51:37,234 --> 00:51:39,327
Yeah, you lie.

777
00:51:39,503 --> 00:51:40,663
You lie.

778
00:51:40,971 --> 00:51:43,496
Is it to do some good,
to get somewhere personally...

779
00:51:43,674 --> 00:51:45,733
...or, what, just for the fuck of it?

780
00:51:46,376 --> 00:51:51,336
Well, I expect that some people do it
to keep things on an even keel.

781
00:51:54,785 --> 00:51:56,776
So you had a parent who was a drunk.

782
00:52:00,657 --> 00:52:02,386
Did you?

783
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:04,186
No.

784
00:52:06,497 --> 00:52:08,260
Let's keep it with you.

785
00:52:08,432 --> 00:52:11,026
Talk about how you feel.

786
00:52:12,836 --> 00:52:15,134
<i>How I feel.</i>

787
00:52:15,306 --> 00:52:17,206
<i>How I feel.</i>

788
00:52:38,062 --> 00:52:39,791
- Fuck.
- Brian, stop it.

789
00:52:45,068 --> 00:52:48,003
No. Please. No.

790
00:52:48,172 --> 00:52:49,969
Ain't gonna hurt you.

791
00:52:53,478 --> 00:52:54,809
<i>You sit there...</i>

792
00:52:54,979 --> 00:52:57,209
...with a mass murderer.

793
00:52:57,448 --> 00:52:59,177
A mass murderer.

794
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:02,547
Your heart rate is jacked.

795
00:53:03,621 --> 00:53:05,350
And your hand...

796
00:53:07,025 --> 00:53:08,424
...steady.

797
00:53:10,829 --> 00:53:15,129
That's one thing I figured out about myself
in prison. My hand...

798
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,495
...does not shake.

799
00:53:18,303 --> 00:53:19,793
Ever.

800
00:53:28,646 --> 00:53:30,773
Wake the fuck up.

801
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:35,242
There was a cop leaving when I came in.

802
00:53:35,654 --> 00:53:37,622
How did you know he was a cop?

803
00:53:37,789 --> 00:53:42,590
Bad haircut, no dress sense and a slight,
you know, air of scumbag entitlement.

804
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:44,922
- Do you see cops?
- That's part of what I do.

805
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:48,293
I normally don't see cadets
who've been kicked out of the academy.

806
00:53:48,466 --> 00:53:51,697
Oh, boy.
You should get a better job, huh?

807
00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:54,231
Should I?

808
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:57,873
So do they all come in here...

809
00:53:58,043 --> 00:54:00,273
...and cry, your cops?

810
00:54:00,778 --> 00:54:03,747
Sometimes they do. Yeah, sure.
Sometimes they cry, yeah.

811
00:54:03,915 --> 00:54:07,112
If they've had trouble at home,
if they've had to use their weapons...

812
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:09,413
Use their weapons?

813
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:11,422
Let me tell you something.

814
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:13,888
They signed up to use their weapons.

815
00:54:14,059 --> 00:54:16,527
Most of them, all right.
But they watch enough TV...

816
00:54:16,695 --> 00:54:19,596
...so they know they have to weep
after they use their weapons.

817
00:54:19,765 --> 00:54:22,791
There is no one more full of shit
than a cop.

818
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:24,765
Except for a cop on TV.

819
00:54:32,211 --> 00:54:34,111
<i>I looked at your file.</i>

820
00:54:35,749 --> 00:54:37,808
I see that you have a record of assault.

821
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:39,507
Yeah.

822
00:54:39,786 --> 00:54:41,811
<i>So what was it like for you in jail?</i>

823
00:54:42,221 --> 00:54:46,453
What, you wanna hear about the showers?
Is that what you wanna hear about?

824
00:54:46,625 --> 00:54:48,456
Did something happen to you?

825
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:50,260
No.

826
00:54:52,464 --> 00:54:56,924
- Okay, let's do this. Come on, spread them.
- Hey, you think you can pop somebody...

827
00:54:57,102 --> 00:55:00,503
...and there's a special card to play?
Jimmy Bags, whose jaw you broke...

828
00:55:00,673 --> 00:55:03,574
...happens to work undercover
for the Boston Police Department.

829
00:55:03,743 --> 00:55:06,109
I'm going nuts.
I can't be someone else every day.

830
00:55:06,279 --> 00:55:07,871
It's been a year. I've had enough!

831
00:55:08,047 --> 00:55:11,175
Calm down. Most people do it every day.
What's the big deal?

832
00:55:11,351 --> 00:55:14,479
- Well, I'm not them. I'm not them, okay?
- Exactly.

833
00:55:14,654 --> 00:55:17,020
You're nobody.
You signed the papers, remember?

834
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:20,751
We're the only two people on this earth
that even know you're a cop.

835
00:55:20,927 --> 00:55:22,952
How about we just erase your file, huh?

836
00:55:23,129 --> 00:55:24,892
How about we erase your file...

837
00:55:25,065 --> 00:55:27,499
...and you're just
another soldier for Costello...

838
00:55:27,667 --> 00:55:30,898
...open to arrest for I don't know
how many felonies. What do you say?

839
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:34,666
How about I fucking kill you, huh?
How about I fucking kill you!

840
00:55:34,841 --> 00:55:36,968
- That was a joke. Come on.
- That wasn't a joke.

841
00:55:37,143 --> 00:55:39,373
You play a tough guy,
doesn't mean you are one...

842
00:55:39,546 --> 00:55:44,916
- ...you lace-curtain, Irish fucking pussy!
- Hey, hey! Stop it! Break it up! Stop it!

843
00:55:45,085 --> 00:55:48,987
- Fuck you, motherfucker!
- Goddamn it, stop it! That's an order!

844
00:55:49,756 --> 00:55:51,849
For chrissake, be smart.

845
00:55:52,025 --> 00:55:55,324
If anybody's watching us now,
how are we not supposed to arrest you?

846
00:55:55,496 --> 00:55:57,054
Come on, get in the car.

847
00:55:57,230 --> 00:55:59,596
Both of you, get in the car.

848
00:56:01,868 --> 00:56:03,563
When are you gonna take Costello?

849
00:56:03,738 --> 00:56:05,865
What's wrong with taking him
on any one...

850
00:56:06,039 --> 00:56:09,338
...of the million felonies that
you've seen him do or I've seen him do?

851
00:56:09,509 --> 00:56:11,204
I mean, he murdered somebody, right?

852
00:56:11,379 --> 00:56:14,314
The guy fucking murders somebody
and you don't fucking take him!

853
00:56:14,482 --> 00:56:18,179
What are you waiting for? Do you want him
to chop me up and feed me to the poor?

854
00:56:18,352 --> 00:56:20,047
- That what you want?
- That'd stick.

855
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:21,983
Will you shut up?

856
00:56:22,156 --> 00:56:24,522
We are building a case and it takes time.

857
00:56:24,691 --> 00:56:25,919
You know that.

858
00:56:27,228 --> 00:56:29,093
Something's wrong.

859
00:56:29,864 --> 00:56:31,695
I'm telling you, something's wrong.

860
00:56:33,701 --> 00:56:35,293
Yeah, maybe.

861
00:56:35,869 --> 00:56:38,599
Look, we need you to keep
your ears open, all right?

862
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,769
No bullshit.

863
00:56:41,308 --> 00:56:44,471
I think Costello's got a spy inside
the Special Investigation Unit.

864
00:56:47,381 --> 00:56:48,905
You serious?

865
00:56:49,083 --> 00:56:50,880
I'm afraid so.

866
00:56:54,889 --> 00:56:57,449
Have you heard anything like that?

867
00:56:57,625 --> 00:56:59,286
Jesus Christ.

868
00:57:01,495 --> 00:57:03,326
Hang tight for me, kid.

869
00:57:03,498 --> 00:57:05,295
Just a little while longer.

870
00:57:05,466 --> 00:57:07,764
We are this close:

871
00:57:09,837 --> 00:57:11,566
All right?

872
00:57:12,873 --> 00:57:14,602
<i>What do you expect coming in here?</i>

873
00:57:14,775 --> 00:57:17,573
- I have to come here.
- I know you have to come here.

874
00:57:18,145 --> 00:57:20,670
But now that you're here...

875
00:57:20,948 --> 00:57:22,745
...what do you want?

876
00:57:23,151 --> 00:57:24,584
You want the truth?

877
00:57:26,888 --> 00:57:28,446
Valium.

878
00:57:28,789 --> 00:57:31,917
If you lied, you would have an easier time
getting what you wanted.

879
00:57:32,093 --> 00:57:35,494
- What's that say about what you do?
- We should have a few more meetings...

880
00:57:35,664 --> 00:57:39,361
- ...before we even talk about prescriptions.
- Look, I'm having panic attacks.

881
00:57:39,534 --> 00:57:43,868
Other night, I thought I was having a heart
attack. I puked in a barrel on the way over.

882
00:57:44,038 --> 00:57:45,630
I haven't slept for fucking weeks.

883
00:57:45,807 --> 00:57:47,331
- Is that true?
- Yeah, that's true.

884
00:57:47,509 --> 00:57:50,205
I said something fucking true.
I want some fucking pills...

885
00:57:50,378 --> 00:57:52,209
...and you're gonna close my file?

886
00:57:52,379 --> 00:57:56,008
- I didn't say I'd close your file. No, I...
- I thought I was supposed to tell...

887
00:57:56,183 --> 00:57:58,777
- ...the truth here, if only fucking here.
- You are! Yes.

888
00:57:58,954 --> 00:58:03,084
A guy comes in here against every instinct
of privacy, of self-reliance that he has...

889
00:58:03,258 --> 00:58:04,247
...and what do you do?

890
00:58:04,426 --> 00:58:08,487
What do you do? You send him off on the
street to score smack? Is that what you do?

891
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:11,396
You're fucking ridiculous.

892
00:58:19,174 --> 00:58:20,971
Two pills?

893
00:58:21,843 --> 00:58:24,004
Why don't you just give me
a bottle of Scotch...

894
00:58:24,179 --> 00:58:26,340
...and a handgun
to blow my fucking head off?

895
00:58:26,515 --> 00:58:29,507
- Are we done with this psychiatry bullshit?
- You can leave!

896
00:58:29,684 --> 00:58:32,084
What did I just put myself through?
I'm out of here.

897
00:58:32,254 --> 00:58:36,691
And what if that was a legitimate threat?
Think about it, fucking hotshot.

898
00:58:38,059 --> 00:58:39,686
<i>Fuck.</i>

899
00:58:48,403 --> 00:58:51,065
Why is the last patient of the day
always the hardest one?

900
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,037
You're tired and you don't give a shit.

901
00:58:53,208 --> 00:58:55,108
- It's not supernatural.
- Listen.

902
00:58:55,278 --> 00:59:00,375
Listen. You know, I'm not just somebody that
you have to see or they put you in jail.

903
00:59:00,549 --> 00:59:03,416
Okay? I mean, if you're in distress,
I will help you.

904
00:59:05,454 --> 00:59:07,012
What's this?

905
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:10,323
It's my card. And a prescription
for 20 lorazepam.

906
00:59:10,493 --> 00:59:12,051
Yeah?

907
00:59:12,227 --> 00:59:13,854
Is it enough to commit suicide?

908
00:59:14,430 --> 00:59:16,921
Maybe it is. All right? Okay?

909
00:59:17,099 --> 00:59:19,260
Have I done my job
up to your goddamn standards?

910
00:59:19,435 --> 00:59:23,166
Because according to my standards,
you fit the model of drug-seeking behavior.

911
00:59:23,339 --> 00:59:26,968
You know, and too damn bad if you
don't like my initial clinical reaction.

912
00:59:27,143 --> 00:59:28,405
Thank you.

913
00:59:29,645 --> 00:59:32,205
I'm transferring you to another counselor.

914
00:59:32,381 --> 00:59:34,372
- Good.
- Okay.

915
00:59:36,018 --> 00:59:38,111
So you wanna get a cup of coffee?

916
00:59:44,961 --> 00:59:47,828
Bring it in here, please.
Would somebody bring it in?

917
00:59:47,997 --> 00:59:49,362
Come on in.

918
00:59:50,466 --> 00:59:54,459
Our target is a major transaction
of microprocessors.

919
00:59:54,638 --> 00:59:56,230
Yes, those.

920
00:59:56,405 --> 01:00:00,136
I don't know what they are, you don't know
what they are. Who gives a fuck. Cash.

921
01:00:00,309 --> 01:00:02,834
Lots of cash is gonna change hands
inside a building...

922
01:00:03,013 --> 01:00:05,277
...that we have
under AV surveillance close-by.

923
01:00:05,481 --> 01:00:09,042
I know this location is not the best,
but we had very little time to set up.

924
01:00:09,218 --> 01:00:11,083
- You guys know anything about this?
- No.

925
01:00:11,255 --> 01:00:14,315
Sullivan's team will ID the bad guys
and listen in on the phones.

926
01:00:14,491 --> 01:00:15,856
Our unit will not take action.

927
01:00:16,492 --> 01:00:20,360
I repeat, not take action, until a man
that Captain Queenan has inside...

928
01:00:20,529 --> 01:00:22,724
...verifies the transaction. Are we clear?

929
01:00:22,899 --> 01:00:26,858
Anybody? Any questions? No?
This is who we're after.

930
01:00:27,703 --> 01:00:30,638
We've been after this cocksucker
for a long time, and tonight...

931
01:00:30,807 --> 01:00:33,332
...we are going to get him.
Let's go to work.

932
01:00:33,510 --> 01:00:36,274
All right, you guys find out
what we're doing and get on it.

933
01:00:36,446 --> 01:00:38,778
Sorry to get you last-minute,
but things leak.

934
01:00:38,949 --> 01:00:40,974
This lead came from
Queenan's undercover guy.

935
01:00:41,151 --> 01:00:45,713
I'm gonna smoke. You don't smoke? One of
those fitness freaks, huh? Go fuck yourself.

936
01:00:50,827 --> 01:00:52,954
- Hi, Dad?
- Yes.

937
01:00:53,130 --> 01:00:55,291
<i>Yeah, something big came up at work.</i>

938
01:00:55,466 --> 01:00:57,957
<i>- I'm not gonna be home for supper.
- Too bad.</i>

939
01:00:58,802 --> 01:01:00,702
Your mother worked all goddamn day.

940
01:01:01,004 --> 01:01:04,371
We'll just have to sit down without you
and your friends.

941
01:01:04,541 --> 01:01:06,702
Oh, no, my friends are still coming.

942
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:13,013
So we'll just... I'll just see you
for lunch instead tomorrow.

943
01:01:13,917 --> 01:01:15,680
Your mother will be proud.

944
01:01:15,852 --> 01:01:17,717
All right, thanks, Pop. Bye.

945
01:01:18,021 --> 01:01:20,512
The readiness is all.

946
01:01:21,291 --> 01:01:25,159
You know the players. Call the game.

947
01:01:26,931 --> 01:01:28,091
Thank you.

948
01:01:29,333 --> 01:01:31,267
- You ready?
- Is your highness...

949
01:01:31,436 --> 01:01:34,599
...gonna drop me off at confession
before work, or fuck me, or what?

950
01:01:34,772 --> 01:01:37,502
What have you got to confess
to that anointed pederast?

951
01:01:37,675 --> 01:01:40,610
A confessional seal, these days...

952
01:01:40,777 --> 01:01:42,404
...I'm not so sure.

953
01:01:47,385 --> 01:01:50,115
He'll operate the cameras.
You ID the guys and log them.

954
01:01:50,555 --> 01:01:52,785
All cellphone signals
are under surveillance...

955
01:01:52,957 --> 01:01:55,721
...through the courtesy of
our federal friends over there.

956
01:01:58,229 --> 01:02:02,029
Patriot Act, Patriot Act.
I love it, I love it, I love it.

957
01:02:05,236 --> 01:02:06,396
Keep an eye on this one.

958
01:02:41,606 --> 01:02:43,836
All right, here we go.

959
01:02:46,512 --> 01:02:48,810
There's Costello. Mr. French.

960
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:50,809
There's Fitzy, Delahunt...

961
01:02:51,183 --> 01:02:53,014
...and the new guy, Billy Costigan.

962
01:02:59,590 --> 01:03:02,058
Time is 10:46.

963
01:03:04,128 --> 01:03:06,187
All right, turn off your cellphones.

964
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:09,357
Fitzy's got the chicken.
Check your weapons.

965
01:03:32,124 --> 01:03:35,150
- We have a blind spot.
- Why do we have a blind spot?

966
01:03:35,328 --> 01:03:37,228
We had two hours' notice. Two hours.

967
01:03:37,396 --> 01:03:40,126
- Fuck you think this is, NASA?
- It never crossed my mind.

968
01:03:40,299 --> 01:03:43,359
- Have you got a camera in the back?
- What back?

969
01:03:50,109 --> 01:03:52,737
- How you going, Robert?
- Good, Mr. Costello.

970
01:03:53,145 --> 01:03:56,774
I wanna tell you, at least two
of these gents have machine guns.

971
01:04:10,497 --> 01:04:13,022
He's from the Chinese government.
He's scared shitless.

972
01:04:13,466 --> 01:04:16,333
Government man. Scared.

973
01:04:16,736 --> 01:04:20,433
I'm concerned about a Chinaman
who thinks it's wise...

974
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:24,008
...to come to a business transaction...

975
01:04:24,310 --> 01:04:26,073
...with automatic weapons.

976
01:04:32,919 --> 01:04:35,888
For his own good, tell Bruce Lee
and the Karate Kids...

977
01:04:36,055 --> 01:04:38,683
...none of us are carrying
automatic weapons.

978
01:04:38,858 --> 01:04:42,157
Because here, in this country...

979
01:04:42,595 --> 01:04:45,120
...it don't add inches to your dick.

980
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:47,493
You get a life sentence for it.

981
01:05:03,550 --> 01:05:08,419
If we had some Homeland Security money
like some douche bags I could mention...

982
01:05:08,588 --> 01:05:10,749
- Any calls?
- They turned off their cellphones.

983
01:05:11,258 --> 01:05:13,453
Search randomly for calls
made from the area.

984
01:05:13,627 --> 01:05:16,027
Eight hundred and seven phones
are live in this area.

985
01:05:16,195 --> 01:05:17,662
Then narrow the area.

986
01:05:17,831 --> 01:05:20,391
What you see there for service
is what you're gonna get.

987
01:05:20,567 --> 01:05:22,467
Why did they turn their phones off?

988
01:05:22,636 --> 01:05:25,605
- Wait. There's still one phone up.
- Where?

989
01:05:37,785 --> 01:05:39,650
The buyers are there.

990
01:05:43,324 --> 01:05:46,691
You know, direct contact with your guys
would have its advantages.

991
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:48,350
Not to my guy.

992
01:05:48,896 --> 01:05:51,626
This is unbelievable.
Who put the cameras in this place?

993
01:05:51,999 --> 01:05:53,261
Oh, who the fuck are you?

994
01:05:53,801 --> 01:05:56,929
I'm the guy who does his job.
You must be the other guy.

995
01:06:00,074 --> 01:06:03,407
If these Chinks wanna nuke Taiwan
any time in this century...

996
01:06:03,577 --> 01:06:07,843
...they'd better shape up
and show me 1 million dollars.

997
01:06:12,987 --> 01:06:16,423
What we generally do, in this country...

998
01:06:16,991 --> 01:06:18,720
...is one guy...

999
01:06:19,027 --> 01:06:21,086
...brings the items...

1000
01:06:21,261 --> 01:06:23,559
...and the other guy...

1001
01:06:23,864 --> 01:06:25,161
...pays him.

1002
01:06:28,902 --> 01:06:30,961
No "tickee"...

1003
01:06:31,572 --> 01:06:33,802
...no laundry.

1004
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:44,343
Go ahead, Fitz.

1005
01:07:00,468 --> 01:07:03,460
Cars are moving,
but did you see anybody come out?

1006
01:07:05,173 --> 01:07:07,232
Please tell me those cars aren't empty.

1007
01:07:07,408 --> 01:07:12,471
I mean, Jesus fucking Christ, please tell
me that those Chinamen's cars aren't empty!

1008
01:07:17,052 --> 01:07:19,987
They didn't figure we had a navy.

1009
01:07:25,827 --> 01:07:28,057
Did you put a camera in the back?

1010
01:07:29,764 --> 01:07:31,994
Can I talk to you for a second, please?

1011
01:07:34,336 --> 01:07:36,566
You stupid fucking hard-on!

1012
01:07:37,405 --> 01:07:38,929
You fucked this whole thing up!

1013
01:07:39,108 --> 01:07:42,373
What the fuck did you do,
you cocksucker? Let go of me!

1014
01:07:42,545 --> 01:07:45,810
I'm gonna rip your fucking arm off
and shove it up your fucking ass!

1015
01:07:46,148 --> 01:07:48,343
Why don't we meet?
Let me buy you an ice cream.

1016
01:07:48,516 --> 01:07:50,746
<i>I'm getting on a plane
unless you put Queenan on.</i>

1017
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:53,912
Queenan had a funeral to go to.
This is my shift. Calm down.

1018
01:07:54,090 --> 01:07:56,115
Why shouldn't I get
on a fucking plane, huh?

1019
01:07:56,291 --> 01:07:58,919
Meet up? You actually want me dead?

1020
01:07:59,095 --> 01:08:01,928
Look, there is a rat in your unit.
That is a fact, all right?

1021
01:08:02,098 --> 01:08:03,565
<i>- Where's Queenan?
- He's not here.</i>

1022
01:08:03,732 --> 01:08:06,792
They knew you had cameras in the building.
They knew everything.

1023
01:08:06,969 --> 01:08:10,132
There is a leak from the inside.
It's real. Man, smoke him out.

1024
01:08:10,306 --> 01:08:14,333
Yeah, how do we do that, Mr. Genius-Who-
Didn't-Even-Graduate-From-the-Academy?

1025
01:08:14,510 --> 01:08:18,037
Disinform. Let it slip to SIU that you have
a sealed wiretap warrant...

1026
01:08:18,214 --> 01:08:22,674
...for Costello's apartment. Don't tell
anyone in our division, but tell SIU.

1027
01:08:22,852 --> 01:08:25,320
Flush it down the pipe,
see if it comes out on my end.

1028
01:08:25,488 --> 01:08:27,353
That's what we do first. Narrow it down.

1029
01:08:27,523 --> 01:08:30,583
<i>- Where the fuck is Queenan, huh?
- He's not here.</i>

1030
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:33,854
You wanna meet up
or you got something real, call me back.

1031
01:08:39,869 --> 01:08:43,032
...changing your life radically.

1032
01:08:43,206 --> 01:08:45,606
Change anything. Right?
Change everything.

1033
01:08:45,775 --> 01:08:47,800
- Right?
- Yeah.

1034
01:08:50,714 --> 01:08:53,080
How long you been with this guy?

1035
01:08:53,916 --> 01:08:56,544
- My boyfriend?
- Yeah.

1036
01:08:59,256 --> 01:09:02,453
- Four months. Almost four months.
- Four months.

1037
01:09:02,626 --> 01:09:04,150
Do you love him?

1038
01:09:06,329 --> 01:09:08,797
It's a pretty serious relationship, yeah.

1039
01:09:08,964 --> 01:09:10,329
It's very serious.

1040
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:14,197
Is he a headcase like me?
I'm just curious.

1041
01:09:14,805 --> 01:09:16,830
No more than I am.

1042
01:09:17,474 --> 01:09:19,465
I know that it's a serious relationship.

1043
01:09:20,109 --> 01:09:22,339
I know there are ups and downs. Right?

1044
01:09:22,512 --> 01:09:24,844
People have doubts and problems.

1045
01:09:25,315 --> 01:09:28,978
Well, not problems, but doubts.

1046
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:35,486
What would you do if he was standing
right there and he saw us?

1047
01:09:40,497 --> 01:09:43,864
I would lie. Yeah, I would lie.

1048
01:09:44,034 --> 01:09:47,561
You know, to keep things
on an even keel, right?

1049
01:09:47,737 --> 01:09:49,830
Right? We talked about that.

1050
01:09:55,378 --> 01:09:57,346
- Morning.
- Good morning.

1051
01:09:57,914 --> 01:09:59,939
Want a French doughnut?

1052
01:10:00,450 --> 01:10:01,917
Yeah.

1053
01:10:03,353 --> 01:10:04,945
- Hey, can I lookit?
- Yeah.

1054
01:10:05,355 --> 01:10:06,583
Sure.

1055
01:10:09,226 --> 01:10:11,854
- All right, we're not having this out.
- What?

1056
01:10:12,028 --> 01:10:14,189
You don't see any pictures
of where I came from.

1057
01:10:14,665 --> 01:10:16,132
Look, I respect who you are...

1058
01:10:16,299 --> 01:10:18,460
...just, you know, not in the living room.

1059
01:10:18,636 --> 01:10:20,228
We might have company.

1060
01:10:20,403 --> 01:10:22,394
- Company?
- Yeah, company.

1061
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:26,541
- Hey, now, why do you work for the state?
- Why not? You do.

1062
01:10:26,711 --> 01:10:30,408
No, what you do. The degrees and all,
everything you got. You're hot shit.

1063
01:10:30,781 --> 01:10:31,770
Yeah?

1064
01:10:31,948 --> 01:10:34,883
So why do you make as much
as a guidance counselor?

1065
01:10:35,052 --> 01:10:38,579
Because I believe in public service.

1066
01:10:40,357 --> 01:10:43,724
So now you're gonna fuck with me?
So now you're gonna be ridiculous, huh?

1067
01:10:44,495 --> 01:10:46,963
- No, don't start with me. Don't...
- Hey.

1068
01:10:47,697 --> 01:10:50,257
Ah, fuck with the fucking phone! Stop it!

1069
01:10:50,434 --> 01:10:52,129
- The phone.
- Forget the phone.

1070
01:10:52,303 --> 01:10:53,770
Get it. Answer it. Answer it.

1071
01:10:54,038 --> 01:10:56,165
This is your first phone call
in the new house.

1072
01:10:56,340 --> 01:10:58,535
You live here now. You're a resident.

1073
01:11:00,511 --> 01:11:02,240
Mayor Sullivan's office.

1074
01:11:02,413 --> 01:11:05,211
<i>Put Colin on the phone right now.</i>

1075
01:11:05,683 --> 01:11:06,980
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

1076
01:11:07,152 --> 01:11:08,676
What?

1077
01:11:09,153 --> 01:11:11,280
I think it's a guy with...

1078
01:11:11,455 --> 01:11:15,448
- It's like a cancer guy.
- Hello.

1079
01:11:15,626 --> 01:11:18,789
What the fuck is it
with you and your phone, huh?

1080
01:11:20,631 --> 01:11:21,996
Something for work.

1081
01:11:22,166 --> 01:11:26,034
Hey. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
It went dead. I don't know, I get...

1082
01:11:26,238 --> 01:11:28,502
Was that that shrink cunt
that answered the phone?

1083
01:11:28,673 --> 01:11:31,301
Remember I told you that we were...
She was gonna move in?

1084
01:11:31,475 --> 01:11:33,170
<i>- Yeah.
- She moved in.</i>

1085
01:11:33,344 --> 01:11:37,075
- You better get organized, quick.
- Last time I checked, I tipped you off...

1086
01:11:37,248 --> 01:11:39,079
...and you're not in jail.

1087
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:42,651
- Are you listening to me?
- Yeah.

1088
01:11:42,821 --> 01:11:46,552
Do you like Little Miss Thing
sucking on your cock?

1089
01:11:49,261 --> 01:11:50,626
Yes. Yes, I do.

1090
01:11:50,796 --> 01:11:52,423
So earn it.

1091
01:11:53,298 --> 01:11:55,357
I'm getting the feeling...

1092
01:11:55,533 --> 01:11:57,433
...we got a cop in my crew.

1093
01:11:57,736 --> 01:12:00,136
Yeah, I know,
I'm kind of getting that feeling too.

1094
01:12:00,305 --> 01:12:03,103
He's one of yours. Inside.

1095
01:12:03,274 --> 01:12:04,366
<i>Have you seen anything?</i>

1096
01:12:04,543 --> 01:12:08,138
I got no access to Queenan's undercover
files. He and Dignam run the snitches.

1097
01:12:08,313 --> 01:12:09,507
<i>- Doing my best.
- Your best?</i>

1098
01:12:09,681 --> 01:12:12,548
What do you think we're in,
the fucking haberdashery business?

1099
01:12:12,718 --> 01:12:14,276
Look, Frank, if you don't relax...

1100
01:12:14,453 --> 01:12:18,321
If you don't relax, I can't relax. All
right? Now, what I need you to do...

1101
01:12:18,490 --> 01:12:21,948
<i>...get me information on the people
with you last night. Your crew.</i>

1102
01:12:22,127 --> 01:12:24,061
Get me social-security numbers, get me...

1103
01:12:24,229 --> 01:12:28,393
Get you? Give you?
Who the fuck do you work for?

1104
01:12:28,567 --> 01:12:31,832
All right, all right. Frank, Frank, Frank.
All right. I'm sorry.

1105
01:12:32,004 --> 01:12:35,201
If you could, please.
What I need are SS numbers, DOBs...

1106
01:12:35,374 --> 01:12:39,902
...just all the pedigree information so I can
run it on my end and we can ID the prick.

1107
01:12:40,078 --> 01:12:41,875
<i>If you can get me that information...</i>

1108
01:12:42,048 --> 01:12:44,482
...I can... We're gonna handle it.
I can handle it.

1109
01:12:44,649 --> 01:12:46,844
Calm down, or you'll shoot in your pants.

1110
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:48,749
<i>I'll get you the records and whatnot.</i>

1111
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:52,083
<i>But listen to me, son.
Don't disappoint me on this...</i>

1112
01:12:52,257 --> 01:12:55,556
...or some other guy will be putting
their fat cock...

1113
01:12:55,727 --> 01:12:58,218
...up Little Miss Freud's ass.

1114
01:13:05,038 --> 01:13:07,404
How are you, Francis?

1115
01:13:12,578 --> 01:13:16,070
- My mother called me Francis.
- I know she did.

1116
01:13:16,249 --> 01:13:19,047
And your father called you the tumor.

1117
01:13:19,217 --> 01:13:21,879
And what did your father
call you, Charlie?

1118
01:13:22,055 --> 01:13:26,048
Oh, yeah, I forgot. He wasn't around.

1119
01:13:26,225 --> 01:13:28,352
You have a boss
that has a laryngectomy?

1120
01:13:28,528 --> 01:13:32,430
No, no, no. That was a guy
who works for me.

1121
01:13:32,598 --> 01:13:34,589
You're lying to me.

1122
01:13:36,369 --> 01:13:37,734
Not exactly.

1123
01:13:37,904 --> 01:13:41,362
What did you do with
the real microprocessors, Frank?

1124
01:13:41,808 --> 01:13:44,504
Microprocessors.

1125
01:13:45,011 --> 01:13:46,239
Oh, yeah.

1126
01:13:46,412 --> 01:13:49,575
I heard the story. You arrested
some Chinese government guys...

1127
01:13:49,749 --> 01:13:53,082
...at the border carrying some
light sockets or something.

1128
01:13:54,788 --> 01:13:57,621
I can't wait to wipe that fucking smirk
off of your face.

1129
01:13:58,292 --> 01:14:00,954
Wouldn't you rather wipe my ass for me?

1130
01:14:01,127 --> 01:14:05,086
There are certain parts of my job that
I'm not gonna be able to talk to you about.

1131
01:14:05,465 --> 01:14:10,232
And I cannot allow you to jeopardize
an ongoing investigation...

1132
01:14:10,404 --> 01:14:12,429
...or your life.

1133
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:16,399
No, really, there are things
you don't even wanna know about.

1134
01:14:17,044 --> 01:14:18,773
Okay, then just say that.

1135
01:14:20,861 --> 01:14:22,226
All right, I will.

1136
01:14:22,863 --> 01:14:25,024
Oh, that's the movers.

1137
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:26,962
Yeah, you still wanna stay?

1138
01:14:27,934 --> 01:14:30,095
- Yes.
- Yeah?

1139
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:33,900
Come on, I'm coming!
It's the worst timing.

1140
01:14:34,342 --> 01:14:36,310
I'm gonna get you.

1141
01:14:37,511 --> 01:14:40,344
If you could've, you would've.

1142
01:14:40,615 --> 01:14:44,176
But I guess you like to go
at your own pace.

1143
01:14:44,352 --> 01:14:48,721
Excuse me. Got a date with some angels.

1144
01:14:56,764 --> 01:14:57,753
<i>Frankie.</i>

1145
01:14:58,699 --> 01:15:00,166
<i>Frankie!</i>

1146
01:15:01,035 --> 01:15:03,128
<i>Your mother forgives me.</i>

1147
01:15:07,908 --> 01:15:09,773
You take off an armored car at the mall.

1148
01:15:09,944 --> 01:15:11,969
What the fuck,
you pay guineas in Providence?

1149
01:15:12,146 --> 01:15:14,979
- Fucking now I do!
- What the fuck do you do?

1150
01:15:15,149 --> 01:15:19,552
I gotta pay Costello for him to trade me
to the FBI? Because that's what he does.

1151
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:22,211
FBI? What the fuck
you talking about, FBI?

1152
01:15:25,661 --> 01:15:27,185
My God, is that French out there?

1153
01:15:27,361 --> 01:15:29,522
What the fuck did you just say
about the FBI?

1154
01:15:29,698 --> 01:15:31,632
Forget what I said. I'm fucking high.

1155
01:15:32,299 --> 01:15:34,790
Whatever may be going on
in that very fucking poor...

1156
01:15:34,970 --> 01:15:38,736
...very limited brain of yours,
I am not gonna hurt you, all right?

1157
01:15:39,007 --> 01:15:41,168
- Just tell me what you fucking said.
- Forget it.

1158
01:15:41,343 --> 01:15:45,245
I'm high. I'm fucking high. I must be high.
I'd never say what you thought I said.

1159
01:15:46,081 --> 01:15:47,070
Fuck!

1160
01:15:47,248 --> 01:15:50,547
Now, what the fuck
did you just fucking say?

1161
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:54,678
Why do you think he never gets busted?
Costello's a protected FBI informant.

1162
01:15:54,856 --> 01:15:57,347
He'll trade you out.

1163
01:15:57,726 --> 01:16:00,422
I thought
I was supposed to go into shock.

1164
01:16:00,595 --> 01:16:03,689
I'm not in shock. It fucking hurts!

1165
01:16:03,865 --> 01:16:06,857
It fucking hurts!

1166
01:16:14,376 --> 01:16:16,606
Hey. It's me.

1167
01:16:16,778 --> 01:16:19,110
- What are you doing here?
- Come here.

1168
01:16:21,316 --> 01:16:24,080
Costello's giving people up to the FBI.

1169
01:16:24,252 --> 01:16:28,552
- The FBI?
- He is giving information to the FBI.

1170
01:16:28,724 --> 01:16:31,090
He's a protected fucking informant.

1171
01:16:31,259 --> 01:16:35,491
I mean, aren't they always trying to make
it a federal case and it never gets made?

1172
01:16:36,665 --> 01:16:39,293
Go around the back.
I'll open the door. Go on.

1173
01:16:43,005 --> 01:16:46,372
- Here's some ice water.
- Oh, thanks. Thanks.

1174
01:16:51,446 --> 01:16:53,141
That's my son, Patrick.

1175
01:16:53,449 --> 01:16:56,577
- Goes to Notre Dame.
- Oh, yeah?

1176
01:16:56,753 --> 01:17:00,120
My wife's asleep but she left some
supper out. You want something to eat?

1177
01:17:00,288 --> 01:17:01,778
No. No, thanks.

1178
01:17:01,958 --> 01:17:05,553
Yeah, come on, man. You have
some supper. We'll talk in the kitchen.

1179
01:17:05,728 --> 01:17:07,355
Come on.

1180
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:44,128
You want some coke?

1181
01:17:49,672 --> 01:17:51,572
There it is.

1182
01:17:52,208 --> 01:17:54,699
Don't move till you're numb.

1183
01:18:09,726 --> 01:18:11,660
Come on. Get inside.

1184
01:18:13,997 --> 01:18:15,828
Boss wants your real name...

1185
01:18:16,533 --> 01:18:19,525
...your social and license number,
your bank account numbers.

1186
01:18:19,702 --> 01:18:21,795
I don't have a bank account.

1187
01:18:21,972 --> 01:18:25,169
- I'm a cash business myself.
- What's he doing, setting up IRAs?

1188
01:18:25,342 --> 01:18:29,278
Just fill the fucking paper in. Your
real name and all your account numbers.

1189
01:18:29,446 --> 01:18:31,277
Then we wait here.

1190
01:18:32,115 --> 01:18:34,845
- You're shitting me.
- No, I ain't.

1191
01:18:46,230 --> 01:18:48,357
Put the forms in there.

1192
01:18:51,869 --> 01:18:54,235
I don't know if this
is how you spell "citizens."

1193
01:18:54,405 --> 01:18:57,067
But fuck it, you know?

1194
01:18:57,574 --> 01:19:00,042
No, no, no. Come here.

1195
01:19:05,015 --> 01:19:07,006
What, are you fucking retarded
or something?

1196
01:19:07,184 --> 01:19:09,345
That ain't fucking right.

1197
01:19:09,519 --> 01:19:10,781
Are you kidding me?

1198
01:19:10,954 --> 01:19:12,251
Look at this. Look.

1199
01:19:13,023 --> 01:19:15,014
"Citizens." Look.

1200
01:19:15,359 --> 01:19:16,690
Billy, he said to stay here.

1201
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:19,585
Yeah. I'm not sitting here
without a tetanus shot.

1202
01:19:19,763 --> 01:19:21,128
Where the fuck are you going?

1203
01:19:21,299 --> 01:19:25,463
I'm not staying, all right?
You can tell him I said that.

1204
01:19:44,789 --> 01:19:46,814
- Hey.
- Hi.

1205
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:50,919
- It's pouring out there.
- Yeah.

1206
01:19:57,835 --> 01:19:59,700
Look...

1207
01:19:59,871 --> 01:20:01,634
- ...if this is inappropriate, I...
- No.

1208
01:20:01,806 --> 01:20:04,434
No, it's not inappropriate.
You're not a patient.

1209
01:20:07,278 --> 01:20:09,246
So you moving out or you moving in?

1210
01:20:10,014 --> 01:20:12,175
I've still got
three weeks left on the lease.

1211
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:23,020
That's me.

1212
01:20:26,098 --> 01:20:27,588
Yeah, I know.

1213
01:20:33,672 --> 01:20:37,369
- Hedging your bets?
- No. No.

1214
01:20:37,743 --> 01:20:39,142
You have to choose.

1215
01:20:39,310 --> 01:20:41,972
- You have to make a...
- A decision.

1216
01:20:42,147 --> 01:20:45,548
A decision. And, you know, you have to
stick by what you choose.

1217
01:20:45,718 --> 01:20:47,982
- You have to...
- Move in with your boyfriend?

1218
01:20:48,152 --> 01:20:50,746
Yes. Otherwise it's...

1219
01:20:51,689 --> 01:20:54,590
Oh, I know, I know. I know.

1220
01:21:05,404 --> 01:21:10,637
I have to say your vulnerability
is really freaking me out right now.

1221
01:21:15,848 --> 01:21:17,509
Is it real?

1222
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:23,149
I think so.

1223
01:21:29,061 --> 01:21:30,926
You don't have any cats.

1224
01:21:31,096 --> 01:21:32,654
No.

1225
01:21:33,632 --> 01:21:35,395
I like that.

1226
01:22:47,707 --> 01:22:48,901
I don't get it.

1227
01:22:51,811 --> 01:22:54,439
We are all convinced
that Costello has at least...

1228
01:22:54,615 --> 01:22:57,778
...one mole inside
the Special Investigations Unit.

1229
01:22:57,952 --> 01:23:02,184
You will investigate everybody
and anybody.

1230
01:23:02,356 --> 01:23:06,520
Well, that's not exactly
a dream job for a cop.

1231
01:23:06,694 --> 01:23:09,959
We looked at all possible candidates.
You have an immaculate record.

1232
01:23:10,131 --> 01:23:13,464
Some people don't trust a guy
with an immaculate record. I do.

1233
01:23:13,634 --> 01:23:15,101
I have an immaculate record.

1234
01:23:16,369 --> 01:23:18,234
How is your wedding coming along?

1235
01:23:18,405 --> 01:23:20,839
Great. Great. She's a doctor.

1236
01:23:21,375 --> 01:23:23,775
- That's outstanding.
- Yeah.

1237
01:23:23,943 --> 01:23:26,070
Marriage is an important part
of getting ahead.

1238
01:23:26,247 --> 01:23:29,148
Lets people know you're not a homo.
Married guy is more stable.

1239
01:23:29,316 --> 01:23:31,978
People see the ring, think at least
someone can stand him.

1240
01:23:32,153 --> 01:23:36,214
Ladies see the ring, they know you must
have some cash and your cock must work.

1241
01:23:37,024 --> 01:23:39,458
Yeah, it's working. Overtime.

1242
01:23:39,894 --> 01:23:42,624
- I'm glad to hear that.
- Thank you.

1243
01:24:30,712 --> 01:24:34,375
Be dirty, be dirty.

1244
01:24:36,551 --> 01:24:38,746
Yeah...

1245
01:24:43,959 --> 01:24:46,689
Frank. The fuck is wrong with you?

1246
01:24:47,561 --> 01:24:50,587
- See anything you like, Col?
- I almost fucking shot you.

1247
01:24:50,764 --> 01:24:53,665
- You're not indulging in self-abuse, are you?
- Sit down.

1248
01:24:53,835 --> 01:24:57,896
I hope you're not turning into one of them
sob sisters wants to get caught.

1249
01:24:58,273 --> 01:24:59,968
You're not cracking up, are you?

1250
01:25:00,909 --> 01:25:03,469
- I don't crack up.
- Pick a place like this...

1251
01:25:03,645 --> 01:25:05,545
...where any cop could see you. Jesus.

1252
01:25:05,714 --> 01:25:08,877
If this is such a fucking bad idea
why'd you show up?

1253
01:25:09,484 --> 01:25:11,145
I own the place.

1254
01:25:13,455 --> 01:25:16,049
Why am I not fucking surprised?

1255
01:25:17,392 --> 01:25:21,123
- All right, lookit, I gotta tell you...
- You're getting reassigned. I know.

1256
01:25:21,830 --> 01:25:23,297
How the fuck do you know that?

1257
01:25:23,465 --> 01:25:25,763
- Where'd they put you?
- Hey, Frank.

1258
01:25:25,935 --> 01:25:29,496
I gotta find myself.

1259
01:25:29,672 --> 01:25:31,264
You're telling me, sonny boy.

1260
01:25:31,873 --> 01:25:34,273
I gotta find the guy
you got in the department.

1261
01:25:35,010 --> 01:25:38,639
With everybody looking up their own ass
and you looking for yourself...

1262
01:25:38,813 --> 01:25:40,872
...I put my money
on nobody finds nothing.

1263
01:25:41,050 --> 01:25:45,487
I know, but, Frank, lookit.
For me, you gotta lay low.

1264
01:25:45,655 --> 01:25:47,486
- Right now.
- Collie...

1265
01:25:47,656 --> 01:25:50,056
...laying low is not what I do.

1266
01:25:50,226 --> 01:25:52,888
All right, fucking Big Daddy Frank.
Fucking perfect.

1267
01:25:53,062 --> 01:25:55,292
What good am I to you
if you don't listen to me?

1268
01:25:55,463 --> 01:25:57,055
What good am I if you don't listen?

1269
01:26:02,204 --> 01:26:05,002
Queenan is compartmentalizing.
He's splitting everything up.

1270
01:26:05,174 --> 01:26:06,835
He's fucking smart. You know this.

1271
01:26:07,008 --> 01:26:10,603
I can get the rat. You just gotta
let me do it my way, Frank.

1272
01:26:14,150 --> 01:26:15,310
Okay.

1273
01:26:19,155 --> 01:26:22,022
But Colin,
I hope I won't have to remind you...

1274
01:26:22,191 --> 01:26:26,218
...that if you don't find that cheese-eating
rat bastard in your department...

1275
01:26:26,395 --> 01:26:30,627
...most likely,
it won't be me who suffers for it.

1276
01:26:31,567 --> 01:26:34,058
Now, why would you have to
remind me of that?

1277
01:26:34,237 --> 01:26:39,402
Would I be any good at what I do
if I didn't fucking already know that?

1278
01:26:39,575 --> 01:26:42,009
Frank, you gotta trust me.

1279
01:26:42,546 --> 01:26:44,912
All right? Just trust me, Frank.

1280
01:26:46,149 --> 01:26:50,711
Hey, it fucking involves lying
and I'm pretty fucking good at that. Right?

1281
01:26:50,886 --> 01:26:52,547
Right?

1282
01:26:52,722 --> 01:26:55,350
Maybe because
it's always been so easy...

1283
01:26:55,524 --> 01:27:00,154
...for me to get cunt that I never
understood jerking off in a theater.

1284
01:27:06,669 --> 01:27:08,227
Christ.

1285
01:27:10,374 --> 01:27:12,899
Who knows what's easy?

1286
01:27:13,677 --> 01:27:18,341
Colin, I know you'll take care
of business.

1287
01:28:03,093 --> 01:28:04,560
Shit!

1288
01:28:43,468 --> 01:28:44,901
Fuck.

1289
01:30:03,047 --> 01:30:04,537
Hey, how you doing?

1290
01:30:04,716 --> 01:30:06,877
Hi, Darlene, hi.

1291
01:30:11,056 --> 01:30:12,921
- That's it for me.
- Yeah, see you.

1292
01:30:13,091 --> 01:30:14,786
Have a good one.

1293
01:30:37,917 --> 01:30:40,078
I smell a rat.

1294
01:30:46,725 --> 01:30:47,953
Jesus Christ.

1295
01:30:49,028 --> 01:30:50,620
You got a girlfriend?

1296
01:30:52,565 --> 01:30:54,226
No.

1297
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:56,459
No, no. Why, what does that matter?

1298
01:30:58,204 --> 01:30:59,569
It depends.

1299
01:31:01,774 --> 01:31:05,403
I'm sure by now you know...

1300
01:31:06,012 --> 01:31:09,140
...I got an informer in my outfit.

1301
01:31:10,116 --> 01:31:11,344
Cop.

1302
01:31:11,517 --> 01:31:16,784
Staties, Boston Police Department,
I'm not sure.

1303
01:31:16,956 --> 01:31:19,117
Jesus Christ.

1304
01:31:20,727 --> 01:31:23,355
Are you sure it's not the FBI?

1305
01:31:24,831 --> 01:31:27,698
It ain't the FBI.

1306
01:31:28,735 --> 01:31:30,669
Ex-wife.

1307
01:31:31,971 --> 01:31:34,030
Old girlfriend.

1308
01:31:35,408 --> 01:31:37,342
Or stupid.

1309
01:31:38,511 --> 01:31:41,878
That is what brings you down
in this business.

1310
01:31:42,049 --> 01:31:43,744
Stupid, huh?

1311
01:31:44,417 --> 01:31:46,317
Well, I guess that leaves me out.

1312
01:31:50,556 --> 01:31:55,926
You know, past days, situation like this,
I kill everybody.

1313
01:31:56,663 --> 01:31:59,097
Everybody who works for me.

1314
01:31:59,565 --> 01:32:01,863
Right. You know, Frank...

1315
01:32:02,036 --> 01:32:04,129
...I look around at your other guys...

1316
01:32:04,938 --> 01:32:07,873
I mean, they're all murderers, right?
Right?

1317
01:32:08,542 --> 01:32:11,705
And I think, "Could I do murder?"

1318
01:32:13,781 --> 01:32:16,944
And all I can answer myself is:

1319
01:32:18,451 --> 01:32:20,476
"What's the difference?"

1320
01:32:21,221 --> 01:32:23,553
Give them up to the Almighty.

1321
01:32:24,091 --> 01:32:26,787
You see, that's my point, you know?

1322
01:32:27,561 --> 01:32:32,055
You accuse me once, I put up with it.

1323
01:32:32,232 --> 01:32:33,563
You accuse me twice...

1324
01:32:35,202 --> 01:32:37,102
...I quit.

1325
01:32:37,705 --> 01:32:42,108
You pressure me to fear for my life and
I will put a fucking bullet in your head...

1326
01:32:42,276 --> 01:32:45,211
...as if you were anybody else. Okay?

1327
01:32:56,356 --> 01:33:00,019
You got something
you wanna ask me?

1328
01:33:02,163 --> 01:33:06,190
Look, you're 70 years old, Frank.
I'm just saying, okay?

1329
01:33:07,067 --> 01:33:09,365
One of your guys is gonna pop you.

1330
01:33:09,537 --> 01:33:11,869
- One of your guys is gonna pop you.
- Yeah, yeah.

1331
01:33:12,039 --> 01:33:14,337
As for running drugs,
what the fuck are you doing?

1332
01:33:14,508 --> 01:33:18,103
You don't need the money or the pain
in the ass. And they will catch you.

1333
01:33:18,279 --> 01:33:20,406
I haven't needed the money...

1334
01:33:20,581 --> 01:33:24,711
...since I took Archie's milk money
in the third grade.

1335
01:33:24,886 --> 01:33:28,151
Tell you the truth,
I don't need pussy anymore, either.

1336
01:33:29,624 --> 01:33:31,455
But I like it.

1337
01:33:32,627 --> 01:33:35,391
Point I'm making here is, Bill...

1338
01:33:35,562 --> 01:33:38,395
...I got this rat...

1339
01:33:38,565 --> 01:33:42,865
...this gnawing,
cheese-eating, fucking rat...

1340
01:33:43,036 --> 01:33:45,436
...and it brings up questions.

1341
01:33:45,607 --> 01:33:49,600
You know. See, Bill, like,
you're the new guy.

1342
01:33:50,844 --> 01:33:52,675
Girlfriend...

1343
01:33:54,515 --> 01:33:59,384
Why don't you stay in the bar
that night I got your numbers?

1344
01:34:00,155 --> 01:34:02,817
Social-security numbers.

1345
01:34:02,991 --> 01:34:05,926
- Yeah.
- Everybody's fucking numbers.

1346
01:34:06,094 --> 01:34:08,892
Is there something that
you just wanna go ahead and ask me?

1347
01:34:09,063 --> 01:34:11,463
Because I'll give you
the fucking answer, all right?

1348
01:34:11,633 --> 01:34:13,567
Frank, look at me. Look at me.

1349
01:34:13,735 --> 01:34:17,034
I'm not the fucking rat. Okay?

1350
01:34:17,205 --> 01:34:18,604
I'm not the fucking rat.

1351
01:34:19,707 --> 01:34:22,039
Start with you agree there is a rat.

1352
01:34:22,944 --> 01:34:24,468
You said there is one, all right?

1353
01:34:24,646 --> 01:34:28,173
I base most of what I do on the idea
that you're pretty good at what you do.

1354
01:34:28,349 --> 01:34:30,442
Sure. Sure, Will.

1355
01:34:30,618 --> 01:34:35,112
You, William. What would you do?

1356
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:41,652
Frank, how many of these guys...

1357
01:34:41,831 --> 01:34:44,231
...have been with you
long enough to be disgruntled?

1358
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:47,369
Think about it.
You don't pay much, you know.

1359
01:34:47,535 --> 01:34:50,504
It's almost a fucking feudal enterprise.

1360
01:34:50,672 --> 01:34:54,199
The question is,
and this is the only question...

1361
01:34:55,043 --> 01:34:59,537
...who thinks that they can do what you do
better than you?

1362
01:35:00,482 --> 01:35:03,645
The only one
who could do what I do is me.

1363
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:08,356
Lot of people had to die
for me to be me.

1364
01:35:10,859 --> 01:35:12,884
You wanna be me?

1365
01:35:16,599 --> 01:35:19,261
I probably could be you. Yeah.

1366
01:35:19,435 --> 01:35:20,925
Yeah, I know that much.

1367
01:35:22,238 --> 01:35:25,298
But I don't wanna be you, Frank.

1368
01:35:25,474 --> 01:35:27,738
I don't wanna be you.

1369
01:35:28,744 --> 01:35:33,681
"Heavy lies the crown" sort of thing.

1370
01:35:34,184 --> 01:35:35,617
Yeah.

1371
01:35:36,452 --> 01:35:38,920
- Francis.
- I'm out of here. You'll set the alarm...

1372
01:35:39,088 --> 01:35:43,184
- Yeah, all right. I'll see you at Christmas.
- All right. Good night.

1373
01:35:45,695 --> 01:35:48,562
You know what I like about restaurants?

1374
01:35:48,731 --> 01:35:50,596
The fucking food? I don't know. What?

1375
01:35:51,100 --> 01:35:55,002
You learn a lot watching things eat.

1376
01:35:57,240 --> 01:35:59,572
There's a boat coming up Gloucester.

1377
01:36:00,543 --> 01:36:03,376
French will give you all the details.
Don't forget.

1378
01:36:03,545 --> 01:36:06,708
Eat something, for Christ's sake.

1379
01:36:10,886 --> 01:36:16,119
In the future, I tell you to do a thing,
you fucking do it. You got that?

1380
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:19,224
I got it. Okay?

1381
01:36:21,598 --> 01:36:23,156
Excuse me...

1382
01:36:23,333 --> 01:36:25,995
- ...French, I forgot my...
- Okay, Francis.

1383
01:36:26,169 --> 01:36:27,158
...cigarette.

1384
01:36:30,140 --> 01:36:32,472
Eat something.

1385
01:36:41,117 --> 01:36:42,106
Problem?

1386
01:36:42,285 --> 01:36:45,812
Yeah, I got a problem. I run rat fucks
like you, okay? I don't like them.

1387
01:36:45,990 --> 01:36:48,322
The day you wouldn't take a promotion,
let me know.

1388
01:36:48,491 --> 01:36:50,618
If you'd taken care of this
I wouldn't be here.

1389
01:36:50,794 --> 01:36:54,321
- Fuck yourself, you piece of shit.
- I need the identity of your undercovers.

1390
01:36:54,497 --> 01:36:58,058
Blow me. Not literally. Unfortunately,
there's no promotion involved for you.

1391
01:36:58,235 --> 01:36:59,224
Fucking prick.

1392
01:36:59,636 --> 01:37:02,628
- Hi, captain.
- Look who's here. The prom queen.

1393
01:37:02,806 --> 01:37:05,138
- They are not happy with me.
- What do you expect?

1394
01:37:05,476 --> 01:37:08,809
Everybody knows you've been assigned here
to find Costello's rat.

1395
01:37:09,580 --> 01:37:12,174
They want to find the leak
as much as you do.

1396
01:37:12,650 --> 01:37:16,711
Like I said, two days ago, my guy
damn near found out who Costello's rat is.

1397
01:37:18,455 --> 01:37:21,356
- But he lost him in the streets.
- Really?

1398
01:37:23,693 --> 01:37:26,958
- Well, did he get a look at the guy?
- No.

1399
01:37:27,130 --> 01:37:29,894
I mean, nothing? Like, I mean,
anything that could help us.

1400
01:37:30,067 --> 01:37:31,295
No.

1401
01:37:33,771 --> 01:37:36,672
So you got any advice for me?
Just, I mean, generally.

1402
01:37:37,441 --> 01:37:41,138
Costello can't do much business without
coordinating with his source...

1403
01:37:41,312 --> 01:37:43,177
...who is here in SIU.

1404
01:37:44,949 --> 01:37:47,315
Follow Costello. You'll find his rat.

1405
01:37:54,959 --> 01:37:57,587
<i>You're gonna be looking at my people...</i>

1406
01:37:57,795 --> 01:38:02,027
<i>...going through their bank statements,
their phone calls and medical records.</i>

1407
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:07,001
<i>Don't be surprised if they don't buy you
a beer or invite you into their homes.</i>

1408
01:38:08,439 --> 01:38:10,430
<i>Let me get you a coffee.</i>

1409
01:38:13,378 --> 01:38:16,609
<i>If I wasn't
with the Massachusetts State Police...</i>

1410
01:38:17,249 --> 01:38:20,184
...if I did it full-time, law school...

1411
01:38:20,785 --> 01:38:22,946
...I'd be through it in a year.

1412
01:38:24,255 --> 01:38:26,155
If I wasn't a trooper.

1413
01:38:30,461 --> 01:38:33,294
But another city. I was thinking that.

1414
01:38:34,532 --> 01:38:36,261
Another city.

1415
01:38:36,501 --> 01:38:38,833
Another city, huh?

1416
01:38:40,338 --> 01:38:43,466
Yeah, well, that would be a clean slate.

1417
01:38:44,009 --> 01:38:47,274
<i>I want you to know,
you don't got to stay.</i>

1418
01:38:49,614 --> 01:38:51,411
If we're not gonna make it...

1419
01:38:51,583 --> 01:38:56,043
...it's gotta be you that gets out,
because I'm not capable.

1420
01:38:57,355 --> 01:39:01,689
I'm fucking Irish. I'll deal with something
being wrong for the rest of my life.

1421
01:39:10,469 --> 01:39:14,303
<i>It might not be a bad idea,
you know, another city.</i>

1422
01:39:32,557 --> 01:39:35,321
- Of course I know how to spot a cop.
- How's that?

1423
01:39:35,494 --> 01:39:38,520
If he's not paying attention to us,
he's a cop.

1424
01:39:38,697 --> 01:39:41,962
Lookit. You see that guy over there?
Right over there.

1425
01:39:42,135 --> 01:39:43,124
Yeah.

1426
01:39:43,301 --> 01:39:46,998
Not paying attention to us.
He's a cop.

1427
01:39:47,639 --> 01:39:50,472
- Okay.
- You get it now, do you?

1428
01:39:56,415 --> 01:39:58,383
- What about this guy?
- Cop.

1429
01:40:00,953 --> 01:40:03,683
Hey, how you doing?
What kind of dog is that?

1430
01:40:05,458 --> 01:40:07,790
She ignored us so she must be a cop.

1431
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:10,258
She's probably
the fucking police commissioner.

1432
01:40:21,774 --> 01:40:25,801
You can get out of here. I'm using
a new crew tonight. New guys.

1433
01:40:27,547 --> 01:40:32,177
- I thought I was on for this.
- I changed my mind. Take the night off.

1434
01:40:32,351 --> 01:40:36,549
Francis, we're ready for the sushi bar.

1435
01:40:37,323 --> 01:40:39,883
- Jimmy, bring a mop.
- Out the back.

1436
01:40:40,893 --> 01:40:42,986
There's guys who answer
the questions right...

1437
01:40:43,162 --> 01:40:45,460
- ...and there's guys that don't.
- And a pail.

1438
01:40:47,867 --> 01:40:49,494
You're a cop.

1439
01:40:49,970 --> 01:40:51,301
What?

1440
01:40:51,470 --> 01:40:53,597
You ignored us, you're a cop.

1441
01:40:54,640 --> 01:40:58,371
We're guessing who cops are. You know,
most good-looking women are cops.

1442
01:40:59,812 --> 01:41:02,940
Well, I'm going home, all right?
He's playing with his new guys.

1443
01:41:03,115 --> 01:41:05,049
- See you later, all right?
- See you later.

1444
01:41:11,892 --> 01:41:14,952
He's moving something with all new guys.
A whole new crew.

1445
01:41:15,127 --> 01:41:18,324
No, no, I can't tell you what or where.
It's probably disinformation.

1446
01:41:18,497 --> 01:41:21,796
Just keep following him, all right?
Listen, I need to see you today.

1447
01:41:21,969 --> 01:41:23,402
<i>- Tomorrow.
- No, no, no. Today.</i>

1448
01:41:23,570 --> 01:41:25,936
<i>- You heard nothing about drugs?
- No.</i>

1449
01:41:26,105 --> 01:41:29,563
Nothing about new guys?
Nothing about Gloucester?

1450
01:41:29,743 --> 01:41:33,509
Not a thing. And I would have.
That information would have come to me.

1451
01:41:35,382 --> 01:41:37,009
It ain't Bill.

1452
01:41:37,184 --> 01:41:38,947
No way, he says.

1453
01:41:51,465 --> 01:41:53,831
Follow Costello. You'll find his rat.

1454
01:41:54,002 --> 01:41:55,526
Yeah, this is Sergeant Sullivan.

1455
01:41:55,702 --> 01:42:00,105
I want constant surveillance
on Captain Queenan, starting right now.

1456
01:42:01,141 --> 01:42:02,836
Good. Thank you.

1457
01:42:05,680 --> 01:42:09,616
Can I ask a question, sarge? Why the fuck
are we following Captain Queenan?

1458
01:42:09,784 --> 01:42:11,684
To find out about the good Catholic life?

1459
01:42:11,852 --> 01:42:15,015
I have to follow every lead,
however unlikely...

1460
01:42:15,188 --> 01:42:18,954
...however fucking painful it might be
to your delicate fucking sensibilities.

1461
01:42:19,126 --> 01:42:21,117
Who told you I had delicate sensibilities?

1462
01:42:21,296 --> 01:42:24,823
<i>- I just don't like it. Don't feel right.
- I have reason to believe...</i>

1463
01:42:24,999 --> 01:42:27,729
...that Captain Queenan is Costello's rat.

1464
01:42:27,902 --> 01:42:30,200
So just follow him and don't get made.

1465
01:42:33,541 --> 01:42:36,408
Sarge, we got the target coming out.

1466
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:14,108
Hey. Where are you?

1467
01:43:14,282 --> 01:43:16,250
<i>Look down the car.</i>

1468
01:43:17,653 --> 01:43:20,121
<i>- You got me?
- Yeah, I gotcha.</i>

1469
01:43:20,288 --> 01:43:22,153
Is there a reason you would have a tail?

1470
01:43:22,657 --> 01:43:24,056
No.

1471
01:43:25,694 --> 01:43:28,527
- Because I think...
- Billy, I don't have a tail.

1472
01:43:29,865 --> 01:43:33,494
Get off at the next stop, all right?
South Station. You wait there 10 minutes.

1473
01:43:33,669 --> 01:43:35,933
South Station. Wait 10 minutes.

1474
01:44:11,874 --> 01:44:15,071
He just went into a building
down the waterfront. 344 Wash.

1475
01:44:15,244 --> 01:44:17,769
You got that? 344 Wash.

1476
01:44:21,951 --> 01:44:23,578
Yeah, he went up to the top floor.

1477
01:44:28,157 --> 01:44:30,819
Building's empty. No tenants here.

1478
01:44:32,327 --> 01:44:35,626
He's got dope coming in.
I don't know where. He...

1479
01:44:36,465 --> 01:44:37,955
He's getting spooky, captain.

1480
01:44:38,133 --> 01:44:39,259
- What?
- I just saw him.

1481
01:44:39,435 --> 01:44:41,960
He had blood on his hands.
He's lost his fucking mind.

1482
01:44:48,545 --> 01:44:50,979
I don't know
what we're doing here, boys.

1483
01:44:51,613 --> 01:44:54,582
He's not including his regular guys.
But I'll tell you something.

1484
01:44:54,750 --> 01:44:58,277
Sooner or later he's gonna find out
who I am and he's gonna fucking kill me.

1485
01:44:58,454 --> 01:45:00,786
- I know it. He's gonna fucking kill me!
- All right!

1486
01:45:07,630 --> 01:45:10,599
I think we got him. I think Queenan's
meeting with him right now.

1487
01:45:10,766 --> 01:45:12,461
All right, all right. Listen to me.

1488
01:45:12,635 --> 01:45:15,433
I'm really sorry for your trouble.
I swear to God I am.

1489
01:45:15,605 --> 01:45:18,870
I'll get you out of this. I can't
do it overnight but I'll get you out.

1490
01:45:19,943 --> 01:45:21,001
Yeah?

1491
01:45:21,177 --> 01:45:23,873
Hey, get the van. We're moving.
Heavy work.

1492
01:45:24,047 --> 01:45:26,379
- What about the FBI?
- They're compromised.

1493
01:45:26,549 --> 01:45:27,982
- They're what?
- They're fucked.

1494
01:45:32,021 --> 01:45:33,181
<i>- Yeah.
- Where are you?</i>

1495
01:45:33,356 --> 01:45:35,654
We've been trying to reach you.
We found the rat.

1496
01:45:36,125 --> 01:45:38,116
<i>Listen, we're gonna take him out.
Lookit:</i>

1497
01:45:38,294 --> 01:45:40,888
The address is 314 Washington Street.
You got it?

1498
01:45:41,064 --> 01:45:42,497
All right, we'll see you there.

1499
01:45:43,032 --> 01:45:44,260
- What?
- You were followed.

1500
01:45:44,434 --> 01:45:46,026
- By who?
- By Costello's people.

1501
01:45:46,202 --> 01:45:47,635
- Impossible.
- One of the cops...

1502
01:45:47,804 --> 01:45:50,534
...he's got on the inside tipped him.
Come on. Come on.

1503
01:45:51,508 --> 01:45:53,032
Come on!

1504
01:45:59,682 --> 01:46:02,150
What the fuck is going on?

1505
01:46:03,253 --> 01:46:06,086
Fucking shit. Looks like Queenan's
meeting with all of them.

1506
01:46:06,990 --> 01:46:09,424
Yeah, he must be our guy.

1507
01:46:09,593 --> 01:46:12,892
<i>Sarge, we gotta get him out of here.
Those guys aren't fucking around.</i>

1508
01:46:17,835 --> 01:46:20,668
Ah, Christ, it's too late.
Let's go back up.

1509
01:46:24,742 --> 01:46:26,539
- Shit!
- You got to get out of here!

1510
01:46:26,709 --> 01:46:28,540
- Take the fire escape.
- What about you?

1511
01:46:28,712 --> 01:46:31,738
I'll be fine. But if you get made
I can't protect you. Now, go!

1512
01:46:49,366 --> 01:46:51,926
- One of you mugs got a light?
- Where's your boy?

1513
01:46:52,102 --> 01:46:55,128
- He's studying law at Notre Dame.
- Where's your fucking boy?

1514
01:46:55,306 --> 01:46:57,399
- Hey! Hey!
- Goddamn motherfucker!

1515
01:46:57,575 --> 01:46:59,600
- Fucking kill you!
- Where's your fucking boy?

1516
01:47:15,926 --> 01:47:18,918
What the fuck was that?
Did you fucking see that?

1517
01:47:23,267 --> 01:47:25,292
Sarge, something
just came off the building.

1518
01:47:26,103 --> 01:47:28,162
What the fuck?

1519
01:47:31,241 --> 01:47:32,230
Fuck.

1520
01:47:32,410 --> 01:47:34,310
What do you mean,
off the building?

1521
01:47:34,478 --> 01:47:37,174
- Something came off the fucking roof.
- It's a fucking body.

1522
01:47:45,889 --> 01:47:47,789
We can't get a visual.
Want us to get out?

1523
01:47:47,959 --> 01:47:50,723
We gotta get on foot
if you want me to get up on this thing.

1524
01:47:51,329 --> 01:47:52,819
- Where were you?
- What happened?

1525
01:47:52,998 --> 01:47:54,795
You're fucking late! Get in the van!

1526
01:47:54,966 --> 01:47:56,331
What do you mean,
off the roof?

1527
01:47:56,501 --> 01:47:58,162
What's going on? I came to meet you.

1528
01:47:58,335 --> 01:47:59,859
- What the fuck...?
- Get in the van!

1529
01:48:00,038 --> 01:48:02,973
I got four armed men right out front.
You want us to pursue?

1530
01:48:03,141 --> 01:48:05,200
No, do not pursue. Stay in the car.

1531
01:48:05,377 --> 01:48:07,504
- Fuck. No fucking pursuit.
- I need information.

1532
01:48:07,679 --> 01:48:09,044
What came off the roof?

1533
01:48:09,214 --> 01:48:10,704
- No pursuit.
- That's bullshit.

1534
01:48:10,882 --> 01:48:12,645
Fuck this.

1535
01:48:20,725 --> 01:48:22,352
Fitzy! Get in the van!

1536
01:48:23,862 --> 01:48:26,797
Get in the fucking van! Let's go! Move!

1537
01:48:26,965 --> 01:48:28,592
All right. I got him.

1538
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:37,235
32X to CP. We're being fired upon!

1539
01:48:37,410 --> 01:48:40,811
<i>An officer is down. I repeat,
an officer is down. A trooper's been shot!</i>

1540
01:48:40,980 --> 01:48:43,005
<i>Send some back...</i>

1541
01:49:00,366 --> 01:49:03,529
So do you know
why Queenan went into that building?

1542
01:49:03,703 --> 01:49:05,534
- No.
- Well, a better question...

1543
01:49:05,705 --> 01:49:07,866
...is why the fuck
were your guys following him?

1544
01:49:08,040 --> 01:49:10,770
I told Internal Investigations
to follow Captain Queenan.

1545
01:49:10,943 --> 01:49:13,343
- Why?
- That's Internal Investigations' business.

1546
01:49:14,245 --> 01:49:15,906
Fucking piece of shit!

1547
01:49:16,082 --> 01:49:17,572
- All right.
- Hey, hey!

1548
01:49:17,750 --> 01:49:19,115
- Fucking bitch!
- Let him go!

1549
01:49:19,285 --> 01:49:22,448
Cocksucker! I don't have to fucking explain
anything to anybody!

1550
01:49:22,621 --> 01:49:24,782
I can fucking investigate
anybody I want to!

1551
01:49:24,957 --> 01:49:27,187
- Come on!
- I don't give a fuck what you think!

1552
01:49:27,359 --> 01:49:30,760
I got reason to believe that Queenan
got killed by his fucking undercover.

1553
01:49:30,930 --> 01:49:32,022
That's a fucking lie.

1554
01:49:32,198 --> 01:49:35,759
He has fucking information
in a locked file, as did Captain Queenan.

1555
01:49:35,935 --> 01:49:37,527
I need access to those files.

1556
01:49:37,704 --> 01:49:40,730
I forgot the password but
if you come with me I'll give it to you.

1557
01:49:40,906 --> 01:49:43,033
- That's a fucking lie.
- Nobody calls me a liar!

1558
01:49:43,209 --> 01:49:46,007
Shut up! Work with the tech guys
to unlock those files.

1559
01:49:46,178 --> 01:49:49,045
- Dignam, take a leave of absence.
- Take a leave of what?

1560
01:49:49,216 --> 01:49:52,151
Queenan is dead. I'm your boss now.

1561
01:49:52,318 --> 01:49:54,684
I don't care.
I'd rather hand in my papers first.

1562
01:49:54,854 --> 01:49:58,255
World needs plenty of bartenders.
Two weeks with pay.

1563
01:49:58,424 --> 01:49:59,891
Good.

1564
01:50:01,728 --> 01:50:03,320
- Piece of shit.
- Fuck off.

1565
01:50:05,265 --> 01:50:07,096
- I need those codes.
- No.

1566
01:50:07,266 --> 01:50:09,393
You want those codes.

1567
01:50:12,506 --> 01:50:14,235
So where the fuck were you?

1568
01:50:15,909 --> 01:50:18,469
Well, boss told me to go home.

1569
01:50:18,644 --> 01:50:22,842
Whatever. Maybe he did, maybe he didn't.
But you weren't at fucking home.

1570
01:50:23,016 --> 01:50:24,483
So where the fuck were you?

1571
01:50:25,085 --> 01:50:27,986
I was at the grocery store
with no signal, all right?

1572
01:50:28,155 --> 01:50:30,146
When I got the signal, I got the call.

1573
01:50:30,322 --> 01:50:33,348
What the fuck do you want from me?
Was I there or was I not there?

1574
01:50:33,527 --> 01:50:35,586
Billy. Billy.

1575
01:50:41,968 --> 01:50:43,492
Yeah?

1576
01:50:45,706 --> 01:50:47,697
Yeah?

1577
01:50:48,175 --> 01:50:50,336
You know what I thought today?

1578
01:50:52,145 --> 01:50:53,840
What's that?

1579
01:50:54,848 --> 01:50:58,306
Who didn't show up today is the rat.

1580
01:51:01,788 --> 01:51:03,153
Yeah?

1581
01:51:04,191 --> 01:51:07,991
- So?
- And you never been late in your life.

1582
01:51:09,896 --> 01:51:12,126
When I called you...

1583
01:51:12,300 --> 01:51:14,530
...I made a mistake.

1584
01:51:14,701 --> 01:51:18,501
I gave you the wrong address...

1585
01:51:18,672 --> 01:51:22,506
...but you showed up at the right one...

1586
01:51:22,976 --> 01:51:24,876
...didn't you?

1587
01:51:26,146 --> 01:51:28,706
Tell me why I didn't tell nobody, huh?

1588
01:51:29,983 --> 01:51:31,314
Tell me why.

1589
01:51:54,208 --> 01:51:57,609
That cop was tough.
We were excessive with the cop.

1590
01:51:57,777 --> 01:51:59,574
He's dead.

1591
01:51:59,747 --> 01:52:01,374
I'm going home.

1592
01:52:01,549 --> 01:52:04,347
<i>- Your guys should not have done that.
- One of us had to die.</i>

1593
01:52:04,518 --> 01:52:06,543
With me it tends to be the other guy.

1594
01:52:06,721 --> 01:52:08,188
But Queenan.
Now I got no access.

1595
01:52:08,356 --> 01:52:11,553
You killed the guy who had the info.
Dignam's gone. Forget about him.

1596
01:52:11,726 --> 01:52:14,388
<i>- He resigned.
- I don't give a fuck about Dignam.</i>

1597
01:52:14,562 --> 01:52:16,029
<i>He put in his papers, Frank.</i>

1598
01:52:16,197 --> 01:52:20,258
- He left. I don't know where he is.
- Don't get your balls in an uproar, Collie.

1599
01:52:20,434 --> 01:52:21,867
<i>That Irish pissant...</i>

1600
01:52:22,036 --> 01:52:25,699
...he's so hot for me, we give him
a whiff of my ass, he'll crawl right in it.

1601
01:52:25,873 --> 01:52:27,932
<i>Let's give him a whiff.</i>

1602
01:52:28,109 --> 01:52:31,772
- I will.
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

1603
01:52:33,448 --> 01:52:35,109
Sweetheart.

1604
01:52:35,283 --> 01:52:37,478
You're giving me a hard-on.

1605
01:52:38,085 --> 01:52:39,484
Are you sure it's me?

1606
01:52:39,988 --> 01:52:43,253
Not all that talk
about whiffing and crawling up asses?

1607
01:52:43,725 --> 01:52:45,716
Watch your fucking mouth.

1608
01:52:45,893 --> 01:52:48,327
No. You watch it.

1609
01:52:49,031 --> 01:52:51,329
Let me straighten you out.

1610
01:52:59,241 --> 01:53:02,108
I tried to call you a few times.

1611
01:53:05,314 --> 01:53:07,077
I know.

1612
01:53:33,476 --> 01:53:37,378
Listen, I can't be a friend to you.

1613
01:53:42,517 --> 01:53:44,417
I'm sorry.

1614
01:53:50,892 --> 01:53:52,621
Yeah...

1615
01:53:57,200 --> 01:53:58,827
...I know.

1616
01:56:07,464 --> 01:56:08,954
Yeah.

1617
01:56:09,766 --> 01:56:12,997
You called this number
on a dead guy's phone.

1618
01:56:13,438 --> 01:56:14,996
Who are you?

1619
01:56:15,239 --> 01:56:17,503
So it is you.

1620
01:56:18,709 --> 01:56:21,701
Well, thank God you're all right.
We were very worried.

1621
01:56:23,113 --> 01:56:24,740
Who are you?

1622
01:56:25,649 --> 01:56:27,674
This is Sergeant Sullivan.

1623
01:56:27,852 --> 01:56:29,615
I'm taking over Queenan's unit.

1624
01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:32,345
Let me talk to Dignam
to confirm it.

1625
01:56:32,524 --> 01:56:33,855
<i>Staff Sergeant Dignam...</i>

1626
01:56:34,024 --> 01:56:37,221
...is on a leave of absence.
He's very upset.

1627
01:56:37,395 --> 01:56:39,590
We're all very upset.

1628
01:56:40,231 --> 01:56:42,995
<i>I think the best thing would be
for you to come in.</i>

1629
01:56:43,968 --> 01:56:46,869
We need you to come in.
Can you come in?

1630
01:56:48,339 --> 01:56:49,328
<i>We'll meet...</i>

1631
01:57:28,514 --> 01:57:30,812
<i>Police confirm
the body of the man found dead...</i>

1632
01:57:30,982 --> 01:57:32,950
<i>...in the Fenway marshes
yesterday...</i>

1633
01:57:33,118 --> 01:57:36,110
<i>...is that of Timothy Delahunt,
an undercover policeman for...</i>

1634
01:57:36,288 --> 01:57:38,779
<i>...the city of Boston.
This was the scene yesterday...</i>

1635
01:57:38,957 --> 01:57:41,926
<i>...when Delahunt's body was found
in the marshes near the Fenway.</i>

1636
01:57:42,093 --> 01:57:43,651
<i>As for who did this or why...</i>

1637
01:57:43,829 --> 01:57:46,229
<i>...that's something police
are working on right now.</i>

1638
01:57:46,397 --> 01:57:49,855
- I don't believe it.
- What can't you believe?

1639
01:57:50,101 --> 01:57:53,559
I spent all fucking night dragging
the poor bastard in there.

1640
01:57:53,738 --> 01:57:55,672
Tell me how they found him so fast.

1641
01:57:55,841 --> 01:57:58,469
Somebody walking
a fucking dog in three feet of mud?

1642
01:57:58,643 --> 01:58:00,804
What kind of fucking
size of dog is that?

1643
01:58:00,980 --> 01:58:03,107
Must have been a big fucking dog, man.

1644
01:58:03,282 --> 01:58:05,512
I spent all fucking night doing it, man.

1645
01:58:05,883 --> 01:58:07,180
I'm embarrassed.

1646
01:58:07,853 --> 01:58:10,515
I still don't believe he was a cop.
I don't believe it.

1647
01:58:10,689 --> 01:58:15,217
The cops are saying he's a cop...

1648
01:58:15,594 --> 01:58:17,789
...so I won't look for the cop.

1649
01:58:19,064 --> 01:58:20,691
Are you soft, Fitz?

1650
01:58:20,866 --> 01:58:25,826
When I tell you to dump
a body in the marsh...

1651
01:58:26,005 --> 01:58:28,940
...you dump him in the marsh.

1652
01:58:29,975 --> 01:58:33,274
Not where some guy from
John Hancock goes every Thursday...

1653
01:58:33,446 --> 01:58:35,539
...to get a fucking blowjob!

1654
01:58:36,315 --> 01:58:38,476
Don't laugh!

1655
01:58:39,318 --> 01:58:42,219
This ain't reality TV!

1656
01:58:46,158 --> 01:58:47,921
Proceed.

1657
01:59:10,382 --> 01:59:11,849
- What?
- Yeah.

1658
01:59:12,018 --> 01:59:14,782
You got a tail. Two cars.
Not very subtle.

1659
01:59:14,954 --> 01:59:18,515
They're not gonna be subtle from now on.
That's what I've been trying to say.

1660
01:59:18,692 --> 01:59:19,818
So get rid of them.

1661
01:59:19,993 --> 01:59:23,087
There's no need for you
to go yourself, Frank.

1662
01:59:23,263 --> 01:59:25,493
Get rid of the fucking tail!

1663
01:59:30,437 --> 01:59:31,995
All right.

1664
01:59:38,311 --> 01:59:41,508
Fucking rats.
It's wearing me thin.

1665
01:59:41,681 --> 01:59:44,479
Francis, it's a nation of fucking rats.

1666
02:00:00,801 --> 02:00:04,134
Stop, stop. Pull them off Costello.
There's no need to surveil him.

1667
02:00:04,305 --> 02:00:06,671
- What are you saying?
- I got it from an undercover.

1668
02:00:06,840 --> 02:00:09,502
He knows he's being followed.
So let the UC take him in.

1669
02:00:09,709 --> 02:00:11,074
- Undercover?
- Queenan's guy.

1670
02:00:11,244 --> 02:00:13,906
He called when he found out
Queenan died. I'm running him.

1671
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:17,015
- You give him to me.
- No, I can give you Costello's destination.

1672
02:00:17,218 --> 02:00:19,686
- You know where he's going?
- Yes. And what he's doing.

1673
02:00:19,854 --> 02:00:22,015
Get rid of the tail,
get Special Ops on standby.

1674
02:00:22,188 --> 02:00:24,622
- We'll take this prick tonight.
- Let's go. Now.

1675
02:00:24,792 --> 02:00:27,784
All units fall back.
All units fall back.

1676
02:00:48,149 --> 02:00:50,208
It's the warehouse he owns
over on Sheffield.

1677
02:00:50,384 --> 02:00:52,978
He's gotta have a container or a truck
or something there. Go.

1678
02:01:17,279 --> 02:01:18,803
Load it.

1679
02:01:26,821 --> 02:01:29,119
Frank, how do you know
you don't have a tail, huh?

1680
02:01:30,391 --> 02:01:32,359
Were you not in the fucking car?

1681
02:01:32,527 --> 02:01:35,587
Yeah, what if they took one off
and they put another one on?

1682
02:01:38,799 --> 02:01:40,596
Load.

1683
02:01:48,176 --> 02:01:50,007
Go, go!

1684
02:01:52,447 --> 02:01:54,005
Come on,
what are you waiting for?

1685
02:01:56,084 --> 02:01:58,211
Frank wants me to check
the back. You go ahead.

1686
02:01:58,386 --> 02:02:01,844
- Watch your fucking back.
- Move out! Go on!

1687
02:02:10,866 --> 02:02:13,300
Cocksuckers.

1688
02:02:19,307 --> 02:02:21,867
Motherfucking shit!

1689
02:02:25,314 --> 02:02:26,975
Motherfucking...!

1690
02:02:30,385 --> 02:02:32,649
Back the fuck up!

1691
02:02:32,822 --> 02:02:34,915
They fucking shot me.

1692
02:02:38,627 --> 02:02:39,753
Get down!

1693
02:02:42,764 --> 02:02:44,322
Come on, fucking bastards!

1694
02:03:03,052 --> 02:03:04,519
Fuck it.

1695
02:03:43,960 --> 02:03:47,726
How the fuck did this happen?

1696
02:03:49,132 --> 02:03:51,726
You're an FBI informant?

1697
02:03:51,901 --> 02:03:54,096
Are you fucking kidding me?

1698
02:03:55,571 --> 02:03:57,266
Grow up.

1699
02:03:57,974 --> 02:04:00,909
Of course I talk to the FBI.

1700
02:04:01,078 --> 02:04:02,568
Do they know who I am?

1701
02:04:04,514 --> 02:04:08,883
I never gave up anybody
who wasn't going down anyway.

1702
02:04:09,919 --> 02:04:12,353
Nobody knows nothing.

1703
02:04:13,956 --> 02:04:15,446
Frank.

1704
02:04:15,759 --> 02:04:18,660
Frank. Frank.

1705
02:04:18,829 --> 02:04:20,820
Do they know about me?

1706
02:04:22,532 --> 02:04:25,057
I know about you, Collie.

1707
02:04:25,235 --> 02:04:28,068
You know I'd never give you up.

1708
02:04:28,805 --> 02:04:31,569
- You're like a...
- What? Like a son?

1709
02:04:32,476 --> 02:04:35,843
To you? Is that what this is about?

1710
02:04:36,813 --> 02:04:41,147
All that murdering and fucking,
and no sons.

1711
02:05:03,173 --> 02:05:05,607
Fucking rat prick!

1712
02:05:27,198 --> 02:05:28,790
<i>Frank?</i>

1713
02:05:28,966 --> 02:05:30,456
Yeah?

1714
02:05:32,203 --> 02:05:33,431
Who's this?

1715
02:05:35,339 --> 02:05:36,966
Gwen?

1716
02:05:38,108 --> 02:05:40,201
Where the hell's Frank?

1717
02:05:41,278 --> 02:05:43,075
Frank got shot.

1718
02:05:45,916 --> 02:05:48,316
Gwen, we lost Frank.

1719
02:05:56,694 --> 02:05:58,321
I got him!

1720
02:05:58,496 --> 02:06:00,930
I got Costello here!

1721
02:06:05,069 --> 02:06:07,560
Hey, good job, sarge.

1722
02:06:08,339 --> 02:06:09,897
No, it's...

1723
02:06:11,309 --> 02:06:12,901
For you.

1724
02:06:13,978 --> 02:06:17,038
- Thank you.
- No. Thank you.

1725
02:06:20,552 --> 02:06:23,783
He's been waiting here
a long time for you.

1726
02:06:23,988 --> 02:06:26,422
How'd you get him without the files?

1727
02:06:26,591 --> 02:06:29,389
Caller ID on Queenan's phone.

1728
02:06:30,361 --> 02:06:31,726
You know that guy?

1729
02:06:31,897 --> 02:06:34,764
Yeah. We were classmates
in the academy together.

1730
02:06:42,206 --> 02:06:43,867
Good to see you, trooper.

1731
02:06:44,042 --> 02:06:46,704
- Yeah.
- Colin Sullivan. We spoke on the phone.

1732
02:06:46,878 --> 02:06:48,436
- Yeah.
- So.

1733
02:06:49,981 --> 02:06:51,744
Now, how long were you undercover?

1734
02:06:51,917 --> 02:06:53,817
Long time.

1735
02:06:53,985 --> 02:06:55,816
- Long fucking time.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1736
02:06:56,221 --> 02:07:01,158
Well, I can't even tell you the debt...

1737
02:07:03,996 --> 02:07:07,329
I just want you to know I'll be
recommending you for the Medal of Merit.

1738
02:07:07,499 --> 02:07:09,194
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1739
02:07:10,135 --> 02:07:12,501
That's kind of like a gold star
around here, huh?

1740
02:07:14,540 --> 02:07:16,337
It's the highest honor we got.

1741
02:07:16,508 --> 02:07:19,306
Look, I just want
my identity back, all right?

1742
02:07:19,478 --> 02:07:21,469
- That's all.
- All right.

1743
02:07:21,647 --> 02:07:24,548
- I understand. You wanna be a cop again.
- No, no.

1744
02:07:24,716 --> 02:07:28,311
Being a cop's not an identity.
I want my identity back.

1745
02:07:28,587 --> 02:07:31,556
Check your computer. Go on.
You'll have to excuse my behavior.

1746
02:07:31,723 --> 02:07:35,682
My only contact in the last six months
has been a police shrink.

1747
02:07:38,330 --> 02:07:40,628
How's that working for you?

1748
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:42,529
Is it helpful?

1749
02:07:43,268 --> 02:07:46,032
What are you gonna do
about Costello's rat in this building?

1750
02:07:48,641 --> 02:07:51,872
- I'm gonna find the prick.
- Yeah.

1751
02:07:52,312 --> 02:07:55,008
I'm gonna find him, I'm gonna arrest him.

1752
02:07:55,180 --> 02:07:58,343
- Good.
- Anything you can do to help me...

1753
02:07:58,517 --> 02:08:02,351
You know, I mean, did Frank ever
mention a name...? You know, anything.

1754
02:08:02,521 --> 02:08:05,115
Someone he was in contact with.
Anything you can give me.

1755
02:08:05,290 --> 02:08:07,850
I'm all done being a cop, all right?

1756
02:08:08,027 --> 02:08:10,188
I just want my money
and I wanna go home.

1757
02:08:10,362 --> 02:08:12,762
All right. That'll be
the best thing for everybody.

1758
02:08:12,932 --> 02:08:14,331
Fair enough.

1759
02:08:14,934 --> 02:08:19,394
I just, I can't get into your file
unless I have your password.

1760
02:08:21,573 --> 02:08:22,597
It's my name.

1761
02:08:23,409 --> 02:08:25,775
William Costigan Jr.

1762
02:08:25,945 --> 02:08:29,210
They gave it to me in case I had to
explain myself to someone like you.

1763
02:08:29,782 --> 02:08:31,716
It's your name.

1764
02:08:33,820 --> 02:08:35,219
All right.

1765
02:08:35,388 --> 02:08:38,084
Fucking unreal, that...
Well, makes a lot of sense.

1766
02:08:38,258 --> 02:08:40,488
Listen, Bill, I gotta run this
in the other room.

1767
02:08:40,660 --> 02:08:42,924
This computer's getting
all frigging blooey on me.

1768
02:08:43,096 --> 02:08:46,862
Give me two minutes. I'll have
you out of here in no time.

1769
02:10:20,195 --> 02:10:24,029
All right, everything checks out,
so let's get you paid.

1770
02:10:54,996 --> 02:10:56,759
I know.

1771
02:10:58,299 --> 02:11:00,790
I know. I'm not...
I'm not here for that, okay?

1772
02:11:01,068 --> 02:11:02,660
I'm not.

1773
02:11:04,873 --> 02:11:08,138
Listen. I've gotta give you something.

1774
02:11:08,309 --> 02:11:10,743
Something I need you to keep.

1775
02:11:10,912 --> 02:11:12,504
For me.

1776
02:11:14,783 --> 02:11:16,375
Okay?

1777
02:11:19,988 --> 02:11:24,288
- What is it?
- This is for you to hold. Only you.

1778
02:11:24,460 --> 02:11:28,419
You open this if something happens to me
or if I call you and I tell you to open it.

1779
02:11:28,597 --> 02:11:31,157
You're the only person
I can trust, all right?

1780
02:11:32,768 --> 02:11:34,360
Please.

1781
02:11:37,906 --> 02:11:40,306
- All right.
- Look, I'm sorry to even...

1782
02:11:40,476 --> 02:11:43,172
I'm sorry to even show up here
like this, you know?

1783
02:11:43,345 --> 02:11:46,610
I... There's just no one else
I could give it to.

1784
02:11:48,050 --> 02:11:50,211
There's no one else.

1785
02:11:50,986 --> 02:11:53,716
- I'm really sorry.
- I...

1786
02:11:54,322 --> 02:11:56,290
You know, I have...

1787
02:11:56,459 --> 02:11:58,893
- I...
- Whatever you have to say...

1788
02:11:59,061 --> 02:12:01,256
...think about it real hard, all right?

1789
02:12:01,429 --> 02:12:04,956
If you still wanna tell me,
you tell me in two weeks, okay?

1790
02:12:34,730 --> 02:12:36,664
I was dreaming I was dead.

1791
02:12:38,033 --> 02:12:42,231
Death is hard. Life is much easier.

1792
02:12:43,172 --> 02:12:46,403
- What's this?
- Open it.

1793
02:12:55,251 --> 02:12:57,913
- Really?
- Yeah.

1794
02:12:58,954 --> 02:13:00,421
Really?

1795
02:13:01,090 --> 02:13:02,614
Yeah.

1796
02:13:02,791 --> 02:13:06,352
And they say
that this little speck...

1797
02:13:06,529 --> 02:13:08,724
...is a penis.

1798
02:13:12,002 --> 02:13:13,867
It's a boy.

1799
02:13:14,036 --> 02:13:16,834
Yeah, well,
one usually follows the other.

1800
02:13:18,341 --> 02:13:20,332
Can you still...?

1801
02:14:10,894 --> 02:14:12,885
<i>I hope I won't have to remind you...</i>

1802
02:14:13,063 --> 02:14:17,261
<i>...that if you don't find this cheese-eating
rat bastard in your department...</i>

1803
02:14:17,434 --> 02:14:21,097
<i>...you can assume it won't be me
who pays for it.</i>

1804
02:14:21,271 --> 02:14:24,104
<i>Now, why would you
have to remind me of that?</i>

1805
02:14:24,275 --> 02:14:29,577
<i>Would I...? Would I be any good at what
I do if I didn't fucking already know that?</i>

1806
02:14:29,746 --> 02:14:32,943
<i>Frank, you gotta trust me.
I can get the rat.</i>

1807
02:14:33,116 --> 02:14:35,482
<i>You just gotta let me do it
my way, Frank.</i>

1808
02:14:35,653 --> 02:14:39,054
<i>Just let me do it.
Let me do what I do.</i>

1809
02:14:39,223 --> 02:14:43,091
<i>Hey, it fucking involves lying and
I'm pretty fucking good at that. Right?</i>

1810
02:14:46,764 --> 02:14:48,322
What?

1811
02:14:51,936 --> 02:14:53,426
What?

1812
02:14:55,740 --> 02:14:58,038
<i>- We got a cop in my crew.
- Yeah, I know.</i>

1813
02:14:58,209 --> 02:15:02,168
<i>- I'm kind of getting that feeling too.
- He's one of yours. Inside.</i>

1814
02:15:02,346 --> 02:15:03,677
<i>- You seen anything?
- Frank.</i>

1815
02:15:03,848 --> 02:15:07,443
<i>I got no access to Queenan's undercover
files. He and Dignam run the snitches.</i>

1816
02:15:07,618 --> 02:15:12,180
<i>- I'm doing my...
- You know what, I thought I was the liar.</i>

1817
02:15:12,357 --> 02:15:15,292
Hey, I can explain that!

1818
02:15:20,465 --> 02:15:22,490
Costello recorded everything.

1819
02:15:22,667 --> 02:15:27,229
He put all the tapes in a box and kept them
with his lawyer. That was his insurance.

1820
02:15:27,405 --> 02:15:28,895
His lawyer came to me.

1821
02:15:29,073 --> 02:15:30,836
Imagine that, you rat fuck.

1822
02:15:31,008 --> 02:15:32,999
<i>Costello trusted me more than anyone.</i>

1823
02:15:33,678 --> 02:15:36,875
Sound quality good enough?
Because I was a little worried.

1824
02:15:37,381 --> 02:15:39,975
- What do you want?
- I told you I want my identity back...

1825
02:15:40,152 --> 02:15:42,177
...you two-faced faggot.

1826
02:15:42,486 --> 02:15:46,320
- All right, where are you?
- Three o'clock. Where Queenan died.

1827
02:15:46,491 --> 02:15:48,425
You keep your cell on.

1828
02:16:00,539 --> 02:16:02,302
Open the door.

1829
02:16:06,311 --> 02:16:10,304
Open... Didn't we already talk about this?

1830
02:16:11,483 --> 02:16:13,644
This is my job.

1831
02:16:38,910 --> 02:16:40,901
- Freeze! Get your fucking hands up!
- Hey!

1832
02:16:41,079 --> 02:16:42,603
Put the fucking gun down!

1833
02:16:42,781 --> 02:16:46,012
Put the gun down, all right?
I came here to talk some sense into you.

1834
02:16:46,184 --> 02:16:47,742
- Hands!
- Just act professional.

1835
02:16:47,920 --> 02:16:49,945
- I can get you your money.
- What did you say?

1836
02:16:50,122 --> 02:16:53,717
- I can get you your money.
- You didn't come here to talk, all right?

1837
02:16:53,892 --> 02:16:56,861
- You came here to get arrested.
- You got fucking tapes? Of what?

1838
02:16:57,028 --> 02:17:00,520
Costello was my informant.
I was a rat? Fuck you! Prove it.

1839
02:17:00,700 --> 02:17:02,691
He was working for me.
He was my informant.

1840
02:17:02,869 --> 02:17:04,734
Shut your fucking mouth.
Come on, get up!

1841
02:17:04,903 --> 02:17:07,303
What is this, a citizen's arrest?
Blow me, all right?

1842
02:17:07,473 --> 02:17:10,306
Only one of us is a cop here, Bill.
You understand that, Bill?

1843
02:17:10,476 --> 02:17:12,376
- No one knows you.
- Shut the fuck up!

1844
02:17:12,545 --> 02:17:15,810
I'm a sergeant in the Massachusetts
State Police. Who the fuck are you?

1845
02:17:15,982 --> 02:17:19,110
- I erased you!
- You erased me, huh?

1846
02:17:19,285 --> 02:17:21,947
Yeah, go ahead, shoot a cop, Einstein.
Watch what happens.

1847
02:17:22,121 --> 02:17:24,589
This bullet would
go right through your fucking head!

1848
02:17:24,757 --> 02:17:27,453
- Watch what happens!
- What, so you can get the parade, huh?

1849
02:17:27,627 --> 02:17:32,087
The bagpipes and bullshit? Fuck you!
Fuck you, I'm fucking arresting you!

1850
02:17:32,265 --> 02:17:35,029
- That's the stupidest thing you could do.
- Shut the fuck up!

1851
02:17:37,770 --> 02:17:40,000
I could give a fuck
if the charges don't stick.

1852
02:17:40,173 --> 02:17:41,868
I'm still fucking arresting you.

1853
02:17:42,308 --> 02:17:44,208
Get up.

1854
02:17:45,378 --> 02:17:48,404
Drop your weapon and step away
from Sergeant Sullivan.

1855
02:17:48,582 --> 02:17:51,107
I called you. You specifically. Look:

1856
02:17:51,284 --> 02:17:54,651
You know who I am. I'm not gonna shoot.
I told you to meet me downstairs.

1857
02:17:54,821 --> 02:17:57,790
Put your weapon on the deck
and step away from Sergeant Sullivan!

1858
02:17:57,957 --> 02:18:00,084
Where's Dignam?
I told you to bring Dignam!

1859
02:18:00,260 --> 02:18:02,490
Shoot this motherfucker!
Would you fucking shoot!

1860
02:18:02,662 --> 02:18:06,359
- Drop your weapon. We'll discuss it.
- Look, he's Costello's rat, all right?

1861
02:18:06,532 --> 02:18:11,196
I got boxes of tapes! Evidence!
Other documents proving it!

1862
02:18:13,606 --> 02:18:15,540
Maybe you do.

1863
02:18:15,709 --> 02:18:17,836
But right now I need you
to drop the weapon!

1864
02:18:18,010 --> 02:18:20,979
I have evidence cold-linking
this prick to Costello, all right?

1865
02:18:21,147 --> 02:18:24,116
- Would you shoot this fucking prick!
- You know who I am.

1866
02:18:24,284 --> 02:18:26,377
- You know who I am.
- Shoot this fucking prick.

1867
02:18:26,553 --> 02:18:28,748
I'm taking him downstairs now.

1868
02:18:32,059 --> 02:18:33,890
You know who I am.

1869
02:18:59,019 --> 02:19:00,884
Shut up.

1870
02:19:01,922 --> 02:19:04,948
I can't wait to see you explain this
to a Suffolk County jury...

1871
02:19:05,125 --> 02:19:06,319
...you fucking cocksucker.

1872
02:19:06,493 --> 02:19:09,018
This is gonna be fucking fun.

1873
02:19:20,174 --> 02:19:22,472
Just fucking kill me.

1874
02:19:24,078 --> 02:19:26,239
Just fucking kill me.

1875
02:19:28,516 --> 02:19:30,575
I am killing you.

1876
02:20:06,788 --> 02:20:09,518
Did you think you were the only one
he had on the inside?

1877
02:20:09,757 --> 02:20:12,055
Costello was gonna sell us to the FBI.

1878
02:20:12,226 --> 02:20:13,921
It's you and me now, you understand?

1879
02:20:14,095 --> 02:20:16,962
We gotta take care of each other,
you understand?

1880
02:20:30,578 --> 02:20:32,170
Give me that.

1881
02:20:47,596 --> 02:20:50,963
<i>Right. Slow. March.</i>

1882
02:20:59,174 --> 02:21:01,369
<i>I attempted to subdue Trooper Barrigan...</i>

1883
02:21:01,542 --> 02:21:06,070
<i>...at which time he drew down on me,
and I was able to squeeze off one shot...</i>

1884
02:21:06,248 --> 02:21:08,409
<i>...and strike him in the head.</i>

1885
02:21:08,584 --> 02:21:11,018
<i>At that time I immediately
checked the vitals...</i>

1886
02:21:11,186 --> 02:21:13,381
<i>...on both
Troopers Brown and Costigan...</i>

1887
02:21:13,555 --> 02:21:16,718
...and discovered that they had expired.

1888
02:21:19,895 --> 02:21:22,159
I just wanna go on record.

1889
02:21:22,898 --> 02:21:26,857
I'm recommending William Costigan
for the Medal of Merit.

1890
02:21:37,846 --> 02:21:40,178
- Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord.
- Ready?

1891
02:21:40,350 --> 02:21:43,251
- And let perpetual light shine upon him.
- Fold.

1892
02:21:43,419 --> 02:21:46,217
May he rest in peace. Amen.

1893
02:21:46,388 --> 02:21:48,720
May his soul and the souls...

1894
02:21:48,891 --> 02:21:53,726
...of all the faithful departed,
through the mercy of God, rest in peace.

1895
02:21:53,896 --> 02:21:55,488
Amen.

1896
02:22:24,927 --> 02:22:27,157
Detail. Half left. Face.

1897
02:22:28,531 --> 02:22:30,522
Prepare to fire.

1898
02:22:30,767 --> 02:22:32,394
Fire.

1899
02:22:32,569 --> 02:22:35,060
Prepare to fire. Fire.

1900
02:22:35,972 --> 02:22:38,998
Prepare to fire. Fire.

1901
02:22:39,442 --> 02:22:42,741
Detail. Half right. Face.

1902
02:22:56,160 --> 02:22:58,526
I'll catch up with you guys.

1903
02:23:05,802 --> 02:23:07,633
What about the baby?

1904
02:23:25,355 --> 02:23:26,982
Hi, pup.

1905
02:23:58,522 --> 02:24:00,149
Okay.
