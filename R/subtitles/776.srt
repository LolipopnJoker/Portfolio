<i>your</i> abuelo <i>Pedro and

11
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:25,627
<i>And though many joined us...</i>

12
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,880
<i>hoping to find a new home...</i>

13
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,800
<i>we could not escape the dangers...</i>

14
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:38,932
<i>and your</i> abuelo <i>was lost.</i>

15
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:44,605
<i>But in our darkest moment...</i>

16
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,609
<i>we were given a miracle.</i>

17
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:55,782
<i>The candle became a magical flame
that could never go out.</i>

18
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:01,121
<i>And it blessed us with a refuge
in which to live.</i>

19
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,460

Mirabel!

174
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,907
What are you doing?

175
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:54,868
They were just asking
about the family and...

176
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:58,747
She was about to tell us
about her super awesome Gift!

177
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:01,124
Oh, Mirabel didn't get one.

178
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,755
You didn't get a Gift?

179
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:10,008
Mirabel! Delivery!

180
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:13,595
I gave you the special since
you're the only Madrigal kid with no Gift.

181
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:18,892
I call it the "Not Special Special"
since you have no Gift.

182
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:20,519
Thanks.

183
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,146
Oh, and tell Antonio good luck.

184
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,566
The last Gift ceremony was a bummer.

185
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,443
Last one being yours that did not work.

186
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:32,573
If I was you, I'd be really sad.

187
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:35,909
Well, my little friend, I am not.

188
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,704
Because the truth is, Gift or no Gift...

189
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:41,540
I am just as special
as the rest of my family.

190
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:43,166
Who wants more pink?

191
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,043
All right, guys,
where do I drop the wagon?

192
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,921
Maybe your Gift is being in denial.

193
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,256
I made a rainbow!

194
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,758
Get the chairs out of the way.

195
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,468
Sorry. Excuse me.

196
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,596
Dolores, can you hear
if anyone is gonna be late?

197
00:09:56,972 --> 00:09:59,266
Lift it higher. Higher.

198
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:00,976
- Hey, nice job over there.
- Yeah, yeah.

199
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:03,020
Camilo, we need another José!

200
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:04,188
José!

201
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,482
Luisa, the piano goes upstairs!

202
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:09,693
I'm on it!
Careful, sis!

203
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:13,864
My baby's night has to be perfect,
and it's not perfect.

204
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:15,157
And people are going to be coming.

205
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:16,533
And nothing's ready.

206
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,743
The flowers!

207
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:21,413
Did someone say flowers?

208
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:23,081
Isabela!

209
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:25,542
Our angel, our angel!

210
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,503
Please don't clap.

211
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:30,172
- Thank you.
- Oh, it's nothing.

212
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,258
A little sisterly advice...

213
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:35,844
if you weren't always trying too hard,
you wouldn't be in the way.

214
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:39,014
Actually, Isa, this is called helping.

215
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:41,141
And I'm not in the way.
You are.

216
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:46,188
Excuse me.

217
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:49,107
<i>Mi vida,</i> you okay?
You don't have to overdo it.

218
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:50,317
I know, <i>Mamá.</i>

219
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:53,529
I just wanna do my part
like the rest of the family.

220
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:54,947
She's right, <i>amor.</i>

221
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:57,574
First Gift ceremony since yours.
A lot of emotions.

222
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:59,618
- Bee stings!
- And I've been there.

223
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,205
When me and your <i>tío</i> Félix
married into the family...

224
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:06,959
outsiders who had no Gift,
never, ever would...

225
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:10,796
surrounded by the exceptional,
it was easy to feel...

226
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:12,089
un-ceptional.

227
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:13,257
Okay, <i>Papi.</i>

228
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,466
- I'm just saying, I get it.
- Eat.

229
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:16,343
<i>Mi amor,</i> if you ever wanna talk...

230
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:20,055
I gotta put out the stuff.
The house isn't gonna decorate itself.

231
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:22,808
Sorry, you could. You look great.

232
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,143
<i>- Corazón,</i> remember!
- Yeah, remember!

233
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,479
- You have nothing to prove!
- You have nothing to prove!

234
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:37,573
{\an8}- You guys can set up over here.
- Clean your rooms!

235
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,700
I don't care how big they are.

236
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:42,369
Has anybody seen my <i>tiple?</i>

237
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:47,666
One hour!

238
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:51,128
No, no, no!

239
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:55,382
Maybe you should leave the decorations
to someone else?

240
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:58,969
No, I actually made these
as a surprise for you.

241
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:04,600
Mirabel, I know you want to help.

242
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:07,352
But tonight must go perfectly.

243
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:12,566
The whole town relies on our family,
on our Gifts.

244
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:18,947
So, the best way for some of us to help
is to step aside.

245
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:22,492
Let the rest of the family
do what they do best.

246
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:24,578
Okay?

247
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:26,455
Mm-hmm.

248
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:30,876
- Pepa! You have a cloud!
- I know, <i>Mamá.</i>

249
00:12:31,043 --> 00:12:34,713
But now I can't find Antonio.
What do you want from me?

250
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,592
<i>Mamá,</i> be nice to Mirabel, okay?

251
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,886
You know tonight will be hard for her.

252
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:44,556
If the Gift ceremony doesn't go well
this time...

253
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:47,059
tonight will be hard for us all.

254
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:54,358
Antonio!

255
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,328
Everyone's looking for you.

256
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:12,793
This present will self-destruct
if you don't take it...

257
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,670
in three...

258
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:16,588
two...

259
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:18,340
one...

260
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:26,056
Nervous?

261
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:30,185
You have nothing to worry about.

262
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:32,312
You're gonna get your Gift
and open that door...

263
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:35,816
and it's gonna be the coolest ever.

264
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:37,484
I know it.

265
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,697
What if it doesn't work?

266
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:46,827
Well, in that impossible scenario...

267
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:50,873
you'd stay here in the nursery with me.

268
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,624
Forever.

269
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,085
And I'd get you all to myself.

270
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:59,381
I wish you could have a door.

271
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:03,719
You know what?

272
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:06,388
You don't have to worry about me...

273
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:09,349
'cause I have an amazing family...

274
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,894
and an amazing house.

275
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,646
And an amazing you.

276
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:20,027
And seeing you get your special Gift
and your door...

277
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:23,655
that's gonna make me
way more happy than anything.

278
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:30,913
But, alas, I am gonna miss
having the world's best roomie.

279
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:40,380
I know you're an animal guy...

280
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:44,343
and I made this so, when you
move into your cool, new room...

281
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,970
you always have something
to snuggle with.

282
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:59,983
All right, <i>hombrecito,</i> you ready?

283
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:03,529
Sorry, I got to get one more squeeze.

284
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:07,157
Okay, okay, we're going!

I don't sound like that.

00:16:49,218 --> 00:16:50,052
Okay, okay.

331
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:51,929
All right, I'm done!

332
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:03,273
Fifty years ago...

333
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:07,152
in our darkest moment...

334
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:11,281
this candle blessed us with a miracle.

335
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:14,409
And the greatest honor of our family...

336
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:20,540
has been to use our blessings
to serve this beloved community.

337
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:24,461
Tonight, we come together once more...

338
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:27,839
as another steps into the light...

339
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,467
to make us proud.

340
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:02,416
I can't.

341
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,128
I need you.

342
00:18:19,892 --> 00:18:23,103
Come on, let's get you to your door.

343
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:32,965
Will you use your Gift
to honor our miracle?

00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:35,884
Will you serve this community...

345

and strengthen our home?

346
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:12,880
I understand you.

347
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:18,218
Of course they can come!

348
00:20:40,616 --> 00:20:42,784
We have a new Gift!

349
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:03,764
It's bigger on the inside?

350
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:13,357
Antonio!

351
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:18,487
You wanna go where?

352
00:21:45,222 --> 00:21:47,808
- That was great!
- Okay! All right!

353
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:50,686
That was amazing.

354
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,648
I knew you could do it!

355
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:58,819
A Gift just as special as you.

356
00:22:02,197 --> 00:22:03,407
We need a picture!

357
00:22:03,574 --> 00:22:06,285
Everyone! Come, come, come!

358
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:10,455
It's a great night!
It's a perfect night!

359

Everyone, together!

The house is in danger!
The house is in danger!

402
00:26:37,514 --> 00:26:40,601
The tiles were falling,
and there were cracks everywhere.

403
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:42,477
And the candle almost went out.

404
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:46,356
Show me.

405
00:26:50,027 --> 00:26:51,445
What?

406
00:26:53,614 --> 00:26:55,073
No, that's...

407
00:26:56,283 --> 00:26:58,118
The cracks were there.

408
00:26:59,203 --> 00:27:01,371
They were everywhere.

409
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:04,791
The house was in trouble,
the candle was...

410
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:07,294
<i>Abuela,</i> I promise...

411
00:27:07,461 --> 00:27:08,504
That's enough.

412
00:27:11,173 --> 00:27:14,176
There is nothing wrong
with <i>La Casa Madrigal.</i>

413
00:27:14,343 --> 00:27:16,553
The magic is strong.

414
00:27:17,012 --> 00:27:18,972
And so are the drinks.

415
00:27:19,223 --> 00:27:21,225
Please! Music!

416
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:38,242
If it was all in my head,
how did I cut my hand?

417
00:27:38,617 --> 00:27:40,994
I would never ruin Antonio's night.

418
00:27:41,453 --> 00:27:43,080
Is that really what you think?

419
00:27:43,247 --> 00:27:46,875
What I think
is that today was very hard for you.

420
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:48,210
That's...

421
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:51,505
I was looking out for the family.

422
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:55,008
And I might not be
super strong like Luisa...

423
00:27:55,175 --> 00:27:58,512
or effortlessly perfect
like <i>señorita perfecta</i> Isabela...

424
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:01,139
who's never even had
a bad hair day, but...

425
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,684
whatever.

426
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:12,359
I wish you could
see yourself the way I do.

427
00:28:12,526 --> 00:28:16,113
You are perfect just like this.

428
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:20,367
You're just as special
as anyone else in this family.

429
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:25,247
You just healed my hand
with an <i>arepa con queso.</i>

430
00:28:25,414 --> 00:28:30,043
I healed your hand
with my love for my daughter...

431
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,920
with her wonderful brain...

432
00:28:32,421 --> 00:28:34,840
- and big heart, cool glasses...
- Stop!

433
00:28:35,007 --> 00:28:36,091
<i>Mamá!</i>

434
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:39,636
I know what I saw.

435
00:28:44,975 --> 00:28:47,603
Mira, my brother Bruno
lost his way in this family.

436
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:51,315
I don't want the same for you.

437
00:28:53,192 --> 00:28:54,443
Get some sleep.

438
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:57,237
You'll feel better tomorrow.

439
00:29:42,324 --> 00:29:44,159
Pedro.

440
00:29:45,452 --> 00:29:47,037
I need you.

441
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:50,499
Cracks in our<i> casita.</i>

442
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:56,547
If our family knew
how vulnerable we truly are...

443
00:29:58,173 --> 00:30:00,759
If our miracle is dying...

444
00:30:03,846 --> 00:30:07,349
We cannot lose our home again.

445
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:11,937
Why is this happening?

446
00:30:14,106 --> 00:30:15,232
Open my eyes.

447
00:30:17,234 --> 00:30:21,488
If the answer is here, help me find it.

448
00:30:22,155 --> 00:30:25,242
Help me protect our family.

449
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:29,538
Help me save our miracle.

450
00:30:39,006 --> 00:30:40,799
I will save the miracle.

451
00:30:48,807 --> 00:30:51,560
Wait. How do I save a miracle?

452
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,648
I figure out what's happening
to the miracle.

453
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,235
Oh, I have no idea.

454
00:31:00,402 --> 00:31:06,283
But there is one person in this family
who hears everything about everything.

455
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,660
<i>So, if anyone would know what's wrong
with the magic...</i>

456
00:31:08,827 --> 00:31:09,661
Hey!

457
00:31:09,745 --> 00:31:10,579
<i>...it's her.</i>

458
00:31:10,787 --> 00:31:11,872
Dolores, hey.

459
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:13,916
You know, out of all my older cousins,
you're, like, my favorite cousin...

460
00:31:14,082 --> 00:31:15,417
so I feel like I can talk to you
about anything...

461
00:31:15,584 --> 00:31:17,252
ergo you can talk to me about anything.

462
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:20,380
Like the problem with the magic last night
that no one seemed to worry about...

463
00:31:20,547 --> 00:31:22,883
but maybe you heard about
that maybe I should know about.

464
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:26,470
Camilo! Stop pretending you're Dolores
so you can have seconds.

465
00:31:27,346 --> 00:31:28,472
Worth a shot.

466
00:31:31,517 --> 00:31:34,353
The only one worried about the magic
is you...

467
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,438
and the rats talking in the walls.

468
00:31:37,356 --> 00:31:40,984
And Luisa, I heard her eye twitching
all night.

469
00:31:43,362 --> 00:31:44,363
There we go.

470
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:47,491
Everyone, to the table!
Let's go, let's go.

471
00:31:53,872 --> 00:31:55,541
- Luisa.
- Family.

472
00:31:55,958 --> 00:32:02,172
We are all thankful
for Antonio's wonderful new Gift.

473
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:04,383
I told them to warm up your seat.

474
00:32:04,591 --> 00:32:06,510
Thank you, Toñito.

475
00:32:06,677 --> 00:32:09,972
I'm sure today we'll find a way
to put your blessings to good use.

476
00:32:10,138 --> 00:32:12,140
Luisa, Dolores says
you're totally freaking out.

477
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:14,810
Any chance you maybe know something
about last night with the magic...

478
00:32:15,143 --> 00:32:16,311
- You do!
- Mirabel!

479
00:32:16,937 --> 00:32:18,605
- If you can't pay attention, I will help you.
- Actually...

480
00:32:18,772 --> 00:32:20,023
<i>Casita!</i>

481
00:32:22,401 --> 00:32:23,652
As I was saying...

482
00:32:24,486 --> 00:32:27,364
we must never take
our miracle for granted...

483
00:32:28,031 --> 00:32:30,576
so today we will work twice as hard.

484
00:32:30,742 --> 00:32:32,578
- Mm-hmm. I will help Luisa.
- Stop.

485
00:32:33,745 --> 00:32:36,290
First, an announcement.

486
00:32:36,456 --> 00:32:40,961
I've spoken to the Guzmáns
about Mariano's proposal to Isabela.

487
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:43,046
Dolores, do we have a date?

488
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:45,883
Tonight. He wants five babies.

489
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:47,259
Wonderful!

490
00:32:47,426 --> 00:32:51,054
Such a fine young man
with our perfect Isabela...

491
00:32:51,221 --> 00:32:54,683
will bring a new generation
of magical blessings...

492
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:57,561
and make both of our families stronger.

493
00:33:00,147 --> 00:33:03,233
Okay. Our community is counting on us.

Luisa, hey. What?

498
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:15,037
- Sorry.
- What is your problem?

499
00:33:15,204 --> 00:33:16,371
Hey! Luisa, hold up!

500
00:33:22,336 --> 00:33:24,922
- Luisa, can you re-route the river?
- Will do.

501
00:33:25,088 --> 00:33:27,841
- Luisa, the donkeys got out again.
- On it.

502
00:33:32,971 --> 00:33:33,805
Luisa!

503
00:33:34,431 --> 00:33:35,474
Wait a second!

504
00:33:36,225 --> 00:33:37,476
You gotta tell me about the magic.

505
00:33:37,643 --> 00:33:39,394
What's going on?
What are you hiding?

506
00:33:39,561 --> 00:33:43,315
Nothing. Just got a lot of chores,
so maybe you should just go home.

507
00:33:43,482 --> 00:33:45,317
Luisa, my house is leaning to the...

508
00:33:45,609 --> 00:33:47,819
Dolores said your eye was twitching,
and it never twitches.

509
00:33:47,986 --> 00:33:49,279
Something's making you nervous.

510
00:33:49,446 --> 00:33:51,907
Hey, move.
You're gonna make me drop a donkey.

511
00:33:52,324 --> 00:33:53,325
Luisa, will you just...

512
00:33:54,368 --> 00:33:56,787
- Just tell me what it is.
- There's nothing to tell.

513
00:33:56,954 --> 00:33:58,997
You're obviously worried
about something.

514
00:33:59,164 --> 00:34:01,083
Luisa, if you know
what's hurting the magic...

515
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:02,960
and it gets worse,
'cause you won't tell me what's wrong...

516
00:34:03,168 --> 00:34:04,586
Nothing's wrong!

517

Maybe I overdo it.

601
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,643
Yep.

602
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,771
There is something you should know.

603
00:37:50,938 --> 00:37:53,649
Last night, when you saw the cracks...

604
00:37:53,941 --> 00:37:56,693
I felt... weak.

605
00:37:57,528 --> 00:37:58,779
What?

606
00:37:58,946 --> 00:38:01,031
- Luisa! The donkeys!
- On it!

607
00:38:01,198 --> 00:38:02,783
Wait, wait, wait.
What do you mean?

608
00:38:03,116 --> 00:38:04,493
What do you think's hurting the magic?

609
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:07,204
Don't know,
but I heard the grown-ups once.

610
00:38:07,371 --> 00:38:09,081
Before <i>Tío</i> Bruno left...

611
00:38:09,248 --> 00:38:11,917
he had, like,
some terrible vision about it.

612
00:38:12,209 --> 00:38:14,837
<i>Tío</i> Bruno?
What was in his vision?

613
00:38:15,003 --> 00:38:17,673
No one knows.
They never found it.

614
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:21,301
But if something's wrong with the magic,
start with Bruno's tower.

615
00:38:21,468 --> 00:38:22,678
Find that vision.

616
00:38:23,178 --> 00:38:26,765
Wait! How do you find a vision?
What am I even looking for?

617
00:38:27,766 --> 00:38:29,893
If you find it, you'll know.

618
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,228
But be careful.

619
00:38:31,395 --> 00:38:34,356
That place is off limits for a reason.

620
00:38:35,816 --> 00:38:37,317
Such a perfect match.

621
00:38:37,484 --> 00:38:38,485
So perfect.

622
00:38:38,652 --> 00:38:40,612
And so good for the <i>encanto.</i>

623
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,133
<i>Casita.</i>

624
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:05,470
Can you turn off the sand?

625
00:39:08,807 --> 00:39:12,060
You can't help in here?

626
00:39:14,479 --> 00:39:15,647
I'll be fine.

627
00:39:16,315 --> 00:39:17,941
I need to do this.

628
00:39:18,108 --> 00:39:20,694
For you, for <i>Abuela...</i>

629
00:39:21,361 --> 00:39:23,197
maybe a little for me.

630
00:39:24,531 --> 00:39:26,992

631
00:39:49,473 --> 00:39:50,474
Oh, hello.

632
00:39:51,642 --> 00:39:53,101
Lot of stairs...

633
00:39:53,769 --> 00:39:55,687
but at least I'll have a friend.

634
00:39:55,854 --> 00:39:57,898
No. He flew away immediately.

635
00:39:59,691 --> 00:40:00,984

643
00:40:33,976 --> 00:40:36,019
Okay, I can do this.

644
00:41:32,618 --> 00:41:33,869
Quitter!

645
00:41:47,257 --> 00:41:48,425
Empty.

646
00:42:20,499 --> 00:42:22,251
What's hurting the magic?

647
00:42:55,033 --> 00:42:56,493
Me.

648
00:44:02,768 --> 00:44:05,187
Where are you coming
from in such a hurry?

649
00:44:05,354 --> 00:44:06,480
I'm sorry I was...

650
00:44:06,647 --> 00:44:08,190

My Gift!

652
00:44:10,609 --> 00:44:12,486
- I'm losing my Gift!
- What?

653
00:44:12,653 --> 00:44:15,572
Mirabel and I were having
this little talk about me carrying too much.

654
00:44:15,739 --> 00:44:18,575
So, I tried not to carry so much,
but I realized it was putting me behind.

655
00:44:18,742 --> 00:44:20,410
And I knew I was gonna let everyone down.

656
00:44:20,577 --> 00:44:23,664
And I felt really bad,
so I was grabbing all the donkeys...

657
00:44:23,956 --> 00:44:27,251
but then when I went to throw
the donkeys in the barn, they were...

658
00:44:27,417 --> 00:44:29,127
heavy!

659
00:44:31,922 --> 00:44:34,716
What did you do?
What did you say to her?

660
00:44:34,925 --> 00:44:36,510
Nothing. I don't...

661
00:44:36,677 --> 00:44:42,140
Mirabel, I have to go get the Guzmáns
for Isabela's engagement.

662
00:44:42,933 --> 00:44:45,602
Stay away from Luisa
until I can talk to her.

663
00:44:45,769 --> 00:44:48,397
Tonight, we can't have
any more problems.

664
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:51,733
And whatever you're doing,
stop doing it.

665
00:45:01,326 --> 00:45:03,370
Why am I in your vision, Bruno?

666
00:45:05,622 --> 00:45:07,249
<i>Tía!</i> Jeez.

667
00:45:07,416 --> 00:45:09,334
Sorry, I didn't mean to...

668
00:45:09,668 --> 00:45:11,336
Shoo, shoo, shoo!

669
00:45:12,713 --> 00:45:14,590
I just wanted to get
the last of Toñito's things...

670
00:45:14,756 --> 00:45:17,801
and then I heard
the name we do not speak.

671
00:45:18,343 --> 00:45:22,264
Great. Now I'm thundering,
and that thunder will lead to a drizzle...

672
00:45:22,431 --> 00:45:24,266
and a drizzle will lead to a sprinkle...

673
00:45:24,766 --> 00:45:27,477
Clear skies, clear skies.

674
00:45:28,896 --> 00:45:30,731
Clear skies.

675
00:45:32,274 --> 00:45:33,901
<i>Tía</i> Pepa<i>? If...</i>

676
00:45:35,736 --> 00:45:40,657
If he had a vision about someone,
what would it mean for them?

677
00:45:40,824 --> 00:45:42,534
We don't talk about Bruno.

678
00:45:42,701 --> 00:45:46,455
I know. It's just hypothetically,
if he saw you...

679
00:45:46,622 --> 00:45:49,499
Mirabel, please,
we need to get ready for the Guzmáns.

680
00:45:49,666 --> 00:45:52,836
I just wanna know if it was generally
positive or, like, less positive...

681
00:45:53,003 --> 00:45:54,713
- It was a nightmare!
- Félix!

682
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,590
Hey, she needs to know, Pepi,
she needs to know.

683
00:45:56,757 --> 00:45:57,799
We don't talk about Bruno.

684
00:45:57,966 --> 00:46:00,385
He would see something terrible.
And then...

685
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,138
Boom! It would happen.

686
00:46:03,305 --> 00:46:04,473
We don't talk about Bruno.

Got your party pants on? 'Cause I...

762
00:49:46,653 --> 00:49:48,989
I broke into Bruno's tower.

763
00:49:49,156 --> 00:49:50,616
I found his last vision.
The family's in trouble.

764
00:49:50,782 --> 00:49:52,826
The magic is dying. The house is breaking,
Luisa's gift is fading.

765
00:49:52,993 --> 00:49:55,829
And I think it's all because of me?

766
00:49:59,333 --> 00:50:00,417
<i>Pá?</i>

767
00:50:03,921 --> 00:50:06,965
We say nothing.
<i>Abuela</i> wants tonight to be perfect.

768
00:50:07,132 --> 00:50:09,760
Until the Guzmáns leave,
you did not break into Bruno's tower.

769
00:50:09,927 --> 00:50:11,929
The magic is not dying.
The house is not breaking.

770
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,639
Luisa's gift is not fading.

771
00:50:13,805 --> 00:50:16,433
No one will know.
Just act normal.

772
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,852
No one has to know.

773
00:50:21,813 --> 00:50:23,440
I know.

774
00:50:25,442 --> 00:50:26,652
She's gonna tell everyone.

775
00:50:26,818 --> 00:50:28,529
Time to eat!

776
00:50:30,072 --> 00:50:34,868
The Guzmáns and the Madrigals together
will be so good for the <i>encanto.</i>

777
00:50:35,035 --> 00:50:39,331
Yes. Then, let's hope
tonight is not a horrible disaster.

778
00:50:40,082 --> 00:50:41,834
To a perfect night!

779
00:50:51,552 --> 00:50:52,970
Avocado?

780
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:00,769
Camilo. Fix your face.

781
00:51:01,937 --> 00:51:02,938
Water?

782
00:51:07,943 --> 00:51:08,819
Mirabel.

783
00:51:09,987 --> 00:51:11,572
The cream, please?

784
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:13,407
<i>Pá,</i> the cream?

785
00:51:17,077 --> 00:51:18,495
...Bruno's vision.

786
00:51:19,246 --> 00:51:21,331
Pepa, the cloud.

787
00:51:21,498 --> 00:51:23,876
Clear skies, clear skies, clear skies.

788
00:51:25,127 --> 00:51:27,045
Bruno's vision.

789
00:51:32,259 --> 00:51:33,343
Mirabel?

790
00:51:34,636 --> 00:51:35,846
Everything okay?

791
00:51:36,847 --> 00:51:39,057
Everything is great.
She's just excited.

792
00:51:39,224 --> 00:51:40,851
For you to propose.
Which you should do!

793
00:51:41,018 --> 00:51:42,644
- Yes.
- As fast as you can.

794
00:51:43,145 --> 00:51:44,646
I was actually gonna...

795
00:51:44,813 --> 00:51:46,523
You were actually gonna.
Great!

796
00:51:49,443 --> 00:51:52,446
Well, since everyone here has a talent...

797
00:51:52,613 --> 00:51:55,115
my Mariano wanted to
begin with a song!

798
00:51:55,282 --> 00:51:58,160
Luisa, could you bring over the piano?

799
00:51:58,827 --> 00:52:00,078
Okay.

800
00:52:01,788 --> 00:52:05,209
It's actually family tradition
to sing after.

801
00:52:07,503 --> 00:52:11,423
Isabela, most graceful of all the Madrigals.

802
00:52:14,301 --> 00:52:15,552
You're doing great.

803
00:52:15,886 --> 00:52:19,806
The most perfect flower
in this entire <i>encanto...</i>

804
00:52:19,973 --> 00:52:20,807
No!

805
00:52:29,525 --> 00:52:31,318
Will you marry...

806
00:52:31,485 --> 00:52:32,569
No!

807
00:52:36,448 --> 00:52:38,534
What is happening?

808
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,160
Mirabel found Bruno's vision. She's in it.

809
00:52:40,327 --> 00:52:42,663
She's gonna destroy the magic and now,
we're all doomed!

810
00:53:12,776 --> 00:53:15,153
<i>Abuela,</i> please!
There's gotta be an explanation.

811
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,613
I hate you!

812
00:53:16,822 --> 00:53:18,448
- I'm a loser!
- Luisa!

813
00:53:18,615 --> 00:53:19,700
What did you do?

814
00:53:19,867 --> 00:53:24,121
I'm not doing anything!
It's Bruno's vision!

815
00:53:30,002 --> 00:53:34,506
The magic is strong! Everything is fine!

816
00:53:34,673 --> 00:53:37,092
We are the Madrigals!

817
00:53:37,426 --> 00:53:38,802
Mirabel!

818
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:34,775
Hey!

819
00:54:50,582 --> 00:54:53,836
It's okay, <i>mami.
</i>Deep breath in, deep breath out.

820
00:54:57,673 --> 00:54:58,549
Stop!

821
00:55:00,759 --> 00:55:02,010
Stop!

822
00:55:24,992 --> 00:55:26,618
No! No!

823
00:55:26,785 --> 00:55:28,912
Help! Help...

824
00:55:29,204 --> 00:55:31,248
<i>Casita! Casita!</i>

825
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:33,584
Help me!

826
00:55:34,001 --> 00:55:35,002
Help me!

827
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:41,383
You're very sweaty.

828
00:55:45,888 --> 00:55:46,722
Oh, no!

829
00:56:00,611 --> 00:56:01,862
- Bye.
- What?

830
00:56:02,029 --> 00:56:03,614
No. Hold on!

831
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:05,115
Wait! Wait!

832
00:56:05,866 --> 00:56:06,992
Why did you take the vision?

833
00:56:07,159 --> 00:56:08,243
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.
Knock on wood.

834
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:09,661
What does it mean?

835
00:56:09,828 --> 00:56:11,830
Is it why you came back or...?

836
00:56:12,706 --> 00:56:13,665
<i>Tío</i> Bruno?

837
00:56:13,832 --> 00:56:15,584
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.
Knock on wood.

838
00:56:15,834 --> 00:56:18,921
You were never supposed to see that vision.
No one was.

839
00:56:19,087 --> 00:56:20,923
- But...
- A little salt.

840
00:56:22,216 --> 00:56:23,217
Sugar.

841
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:29,473
Wait.

842
00:56:30,265 --> 00:56:33,227
Have you been in here
patching the cracks?

843
00:56:34,186 --> 00:56:37,439
Oh, that? No, no, no.
I'm too scared to go near those things.

844
00:56:37,606 --> 00:56:39,650
All the patching's done by Hernando.

845
00:56:39,816 --> 00:56:43,278
- Who is Hernando?
- I'm Hernando and I'm scared of nothing!

846
00:56:45,113 --> 00:56:46,615
It's actually me.

847
00:56:47,074 --> 00:56:48,992
I used to say my real Gift was "acting."

848
00:56:50,911 --> 00:56:53,539
I'm Jorge. I make the spackle.

849
00:56:55,666 --> 00:56:58,627
How long have you been back here?

850
00:57:04,216 --> 00:57:05,759
You never left.

851
00:57:06,802 --> 00:57:10,097
Well, I left my tower, which was,
you know, a lot of stairs...

852
00:57:10,264 --> 00:57:12,850
and here, kitchen adjacent.

853
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:17,020
Plus, free entertainment.

854
00:57:17,187 --> 00:57:19,106
So, what do you like?
You like sports?

855
00:57:19,565 --> 00:57:22,150
Game shows?
Telenovelas?

856
00:57:23,819 --> 00:57:26,280
Their love could never be.

857
00:57:26,446 --> 00:57:27,990
I don't understand.

858
00:57:28,156 --> 00:57:30,033
Well, because she's his aunt
and she has amnesia...

859
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,077
so she can't remember
that she's his aunt.

860
00:57:32,244 --> 00:57:34,746
It's like a very forbidden kind of...

861
00:57:34,913 --> 00:57:40,127
I don't understand why you left,
but didn't leave.

862
00:57:40,919 --> 00:57:45,591
Oh, well, because, the mountains
around the <i>encanto</i> are pretty tall.

863
00:57:45,757 --> 00:57:49,636
And like I said,
free food and everything.

864
00:57:49,803 --> 00:57:51,889
You guys love the free food, don't ya?

865
00:57:52,264 --> 00:57:54,641
Always hungry.
Never satisfied.

866
00:58:15,245 --> 00:58:18,123
My Gift wasn't helping the family...

867
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:20,918
but, I love my family, you know?

868
00:58:21,543 --> 00:58:25,255
I just don't know how to...

869
00:58:25,881 --> 00:58:28,342
Well, anyway,
I think you should go, because...

870
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:30,677
I don't really have a good reason,
but, if I did, you'd be like...

871
00:58:30,886 --> 00:58:32,596
"I should go, because that's a good reason."

872
00:58:34,598 --> 00:58:35,807
Why was I in your vision?

873
00:58:38,268 --> 00:58:39,645
<i>Tío</i> Bruno?

874
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:45,984
I just wanted to make
the family proud of me.

875
00:58:46,527 --> 00:58:47,778
Just once.

876
00:58:49,905 --> 00:58:51,740
But if I should stop...

877
00:58:53,283 --> 00:58:55,619
if I'm hurting my family...

878
00:58:56,495 --> 00:58:58,372
just tell me.

879
00:58:59,498 --> 00:59:01,041
I can't tell you...

880
00:59:01,959 --> 00:59:03,877
because I don't know.

881
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:09,049
I had this vision the night
that you didn't get your Gift.

882
00:59:09,967 --> 00:59:11,552
Abuela <i>worried about the magic.</i>

883
00:59:11,718 --> 00:59:15,556
<i>So, she begged me to look into the future.
See what it meant.</i>

884
00:59:17,057 --> 00:59:20,269
<i>And I saw the magic in danger.</i>

885
00:59:21,144 --> 00:59:24,231
<i>Our house breaking.</i>

886
00:59:24,398 --> 00:59:28,235
<i>And then, and then, and then, I saw you.</i>

887
00:59:28,402 --> 00:59:31,989
<i>But the vision was different.
It would change.</i>

888
00:59:32,155 --> 00:59:35,409
<i>And there was no one answer.
No clear fate.</i>

889
00:59:35,576 --> 00:59:38,537
<i>Like your future was undecided.</i>

890
00:59:39,454 --> 00:59:41,874
<i>But I knew how it was gonna look.
I knew what everyone would think...</i>

891
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:45,043
<i>because I'm Bruno and
everyone always assumes the worst, so...</i>

892
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,297
<i>so...</i>

893
00:59:49,673 --> 00:59:54,553
You left to protect me?

894
00:59:55,762 --> 00:59:57,472
I don't know which way it'll go...

895
00:59:58,307 --> 00:59:59,558
but my guess...

896
00:59:59,725 --> 01:00:01,977
the family, the <i>encanto</i>...

897
01:00:02,352 --> 01:00:04,313
and the fate of the miracle itself...

898
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,357
Well, it's all gonna come down to you.

899
01:00:09,985 --> 01:00:11,111
Or maybe I'm wrong.

900
01:00:11,278 --> 01:00:13,780
You know, it's a mystery.
That's why this vision is...

901
01:00:15,657 --> 01:00:19,203
Look, if I could help anymore,
I would...

902
01:00:19,369 --> 01:00:21,413
but that's all I know.

903
01:00:21,747 --> 01:00:24,625
Good luck.
I wish I could've seen more.

904
01:00:25,918 --> 01:00:26,919
Yeah.

905
01:00:30,672 --> 01:00:32,132
Yeah.

906
01:00:32,925 --> 01:00:35,761
You wish you could have seen more,
so see more!

907
01:00:35,928 --> 01:00:37,888
Have another vision.

908
01:00:38,055 --> 01:00:40,432
No, no.
See, I don't do visions anymore.

909
01:00:40,599 --> 01:00:41,808
- But you could.
- But I won't.

910
01:00:41,975 --> 01:00:45,979
You can't say the weight of the world
is on your shoulders. The end.

911
01:00:46,146 --> 01:00:49,900
If our fate's up to me,
me says have another vision.

912
01:00:50,776 --> 01:00:52,027
Maybe it'll show me what to do.

913
01:00:52,194 --> 01:00:56,031
Look, even if I wanted to, which I don't,
you wrecked my vision cave.

914
01:00:56,198 --> 01:00:58,700
Which is a problem,
'cause I need a big open space.

915
01:00:58,867 --> 01:01:00,452
- We'll find one.
- Where?

916
01:01:00,619 --> 01:01:01,620
Use my room.

917
01:01:02,996 --> 01:01:05,874
The rats told me everything.
Don't eat those.

918
01:01:09,294 --> 01:01:14,174
Our family needs help,
and you need to get outta here.

919
01:01:31,024 --> 01:01:33,902
You should have told me
the second you saw the vision.

920
01:01:34,069 --> 01:01:35,070
Think of the family.

921
01:01:35,279 --> 01:01:37,281
I was thinking of my daughter.

922
01:01:38,156 --> 01:01:39,700
Pepa, calm down.

923
01:01:39,867 --> 01:01:41,118
- I'm doing my best.
- Yes.

924
01:01:41,285 --> 01:01:42,911
You're lucky it's not a hurricane.

925
01:01:43,078 --> 01:01:46,540
<i>Mamá,</i> you've always been
too hard on Mirabel.

926
01:01:46,707 --> 01:01:48,125
Look around.

927
01:01:48,292 --> 01:01:53,338
We must protect our family, our <i>encanto.</i>
We cannot lose our home.

928
01:01:55,549 --> 01:01:59,011
People in town are becoming anxious
about the magic.

929
01:01:59,178 --> 01:02:00,429
They want to see you.

930
01:02:01,138 --> 01:02:03,724
Mirabel was in that vision for a reason.

931
01:02:04,975 --> 01:02:06,059
Find her.

932
01:02:11,732 --> 01:02:13,942
We might wanna hurry.

933
01:02:14,109 --> 01:02:16,320
You can't hurry the future.

934
01:02:19,031 --> 01:02:20,991
What if I show you something worse?

935
01:02:21,158 --> 01:02:23,619
If I see something that you don't like,
you're gonna be all...

936
01:02:23,785 --> 01:02:27,664
"Bruno makes bad things happen. Oh, he's
creepy and his vision killed my goldfish."

937
01:02:28,248 --> 01:02:30,459
I don't think you
make bad things happen.

938
01:02:31,251 --> 01:02:35,422
Sometimes family weirdos
just get a bad rap.

939
01:02:36,215 --> 01:02:37,424
You can do this.

940
01:02:41,136 --> 01:02:42,179
For the nerves.

941
01:02:46,183 --> 01:02:49,686
I can do this. I can do this,
I can do this, I can do this.

942
01:03:23,887 --> 01:03:25,722
You might wanna hang on.

943
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:02,551
It's just the same thing.
I gotta stop!

944
01:04:02,718 --> 01:04:07,264
No. I need to know which way it goes.
There's gotta be an answer.

945
01:04:07,431 --> 01:04:08,599
Something we're not seeing!

946
01:04:08,765 --> 01:04:10,350
You're looking at the same thing that I am.

947
01:04:10,642 --> 01:04:12,060
- If there was something else...
- There!

948
01:04:12,352 --> 01:04:13,604
Over there!

949
01:04:14,396 --> 01:04:15,272
Butterfly!

950
01:04:15,439 --> 01:04:16,940
Follow the butterfly!

951
01:04:22,404 --> 01:04:23,447
Where is that?

952
01:04:23,864 --> 01:04:25,782
It's all out of order.

953
01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:30,621
It's the candle.
The candle's getting brighter!

954
01:04:30,829 --> 01:04:33,290
- I think you're gonna help the candle!
- How?

955
01:04:33,665 --> 01:04:35,334
There's someone with you.

956
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:37,836
- And you fight her!
- What?

957
01:04:38,003 --> 01:04:39,588
Wait, no, no.
Is that a hug?

958
01:04:39,755 --> 01:04:40,756
Am I fighting or hugging?

959
01:04:41,757 --> 01:04:43,717
An embrace.
An embrace!

960
01:04:43,884 --> 01:04:45,886
To make the candle bright
you have to embrace her.

961
01:04:46,053 --> 01:04:47,346
Embrace who?

962
01:04:47,846 --> 01:04:48,931
Almost there.

963
01:04:49,097 --> 01:04:50,891
- Who is it?
- Almost there.

964
01:04:51,808 --> 01:04:52,809
I got it!

965
01:04:54,561 --> 01:04:56,104
Isabela?

966
01:05:01,276 --> 01:05:03,529
Your sister? That's great!

967
01:05:05,572 --> 01:05:06,782
Every time.

968
01:05:08,408 --> 01:05:11,078
Why would embracing Isabela
do anything?

969
01:05:11,245 --> 01:05:14,081
I don't know. Our family got a miracle.
How do you help a family miracle?

970
01:05:14,248 --> 01:05:15,249
You hug a sister.

971
01:05:15,415 --> 01:05:18,460
Mirabel?
Mirabel?

972
01:05:19,336 --> 01:05:21,463
Mirabel?

973
01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:23,590
Well, I think
we're running out of time here.

974
01:05:23,757 --> 01:05:25,133
It's not gonna work.

975
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:28,303
She won't hug me ever, okay?
She hates me!

976
01:05:28,470 --> 01:05:30,931
Also, I don't know if you heard,
I ruined her proposal!

977
01:05:31,098 --> 01:05:33,600
- Plus, P.S., she is just annoying.
- Mirabel?

978
01:05:33,767 --> 01:05:35,477
- Of course it's Isabela!
- Mirabel?

979
01:05:35,644 --> 01:05:36,979
What's her problem with me anyway?

980
01:05:37,145 --> 01:05:38,397
She's the one with roses
coming out of her...

981
01:05:38,564 --> 01:05:39,731
Mirabel!

982
01:05:39,898 --> 01:05:41,400
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

983
01:05:41,567 --> 01:05:43,402
You see, you're missing the point.

984
01:05:43,819 --> 01:05:46,071
The fate of the family,
it's not up to her.

985
01:05:46,238 --> 01:05:47,614
It's up to you.

986
01:05:48,156 --> 01:05:51,493
You're exactly what this family needs.

987
01:05:52,870 --> 01:05:54,371
You just have to see it.

988
01:05:55,414 --> 01:05:57,165
By yourself, after I leave.

989
01:05:58,250 --> 01:06:00,043
What, you're not coming?

990
01:06:01,211 --> 01:06:04,006
It was your vision, Mirabel. Not mine.

991
01:06:04,173 --> 01:06:05,591
You're afraid <i>Abuela</i> will see you.

992
01:06:05,757 --> 01:06:07,718
Yep. I mean, yes, that too.

993
01:06:09,928 --> 01:06:13,432
Hey, after you save
the miracle, come visit.

994
01:06:14,391 --> 01:06:18,854
After I save the miracle,
I'm bringing you home.

995
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:21,815
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.
Knock on wood.

996
01:06:34,328 --> 01:06:38,248
You got this.
Just gonna save the miracle.

997
01:06:39,166 --> 01:06:40,667
With a hug.

998
01:06:41,877 --> 01:06:44,671
Isa? Hey.

999
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:48,425
I know we've had our issues...

1000
01:06:48,592 --> 01:06:54,389
but I'm ready to be a better sister...
to you.

1001
01:06:54,806 --> 01:06:57,100
So, we should just hug.

1002
01:06:57,518 --> 01:06:59,853
Let's hug it out, huh?

1003
01:07:00,979 --> 01:07:03,315
"Hug it out"?

1004
01:07:04,358 --> 01:07:07,027
Luisa can't lift an empanada<i>...</i>

1005
01:07:07,486 --> 01:07:11,406
Mariano's nose
looks like a smashed papaya!

1006
01:07:11,949 --> 01:07:13,492
Have you lost your mind?

1007
01:07:14,952 --> 01:07:17,955
Isa, I feel like you're upset.

1008
01:07:18,121 --> 01:07:21,917
And you know what cures being upset?
A warm embrace.

1009
01:07:22,417 --> 01:07:24,044
Get out.

1010
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:27,422
Everything was perfect.

1011
01:07:27,589 --> 01:07:29,800
<i>Abuela</i> was happy.
The family was happy.

1012
01:07:29,967 --> 01:07:35,764
You wanna be a better sister?
Apologize for ruining my life.

1013
01:07:39,434 --> 01:07:43,021
Go on. Apologize.

1014
01:07:46,567 --> 01:07:47,776
I...

1015
01:07:49,194 --> 01:07:50,529
am...

1016
01:07:51,697 --> 01:07:52,698
sorry...

1017
01:07:55,158 --> 01:07:58,287
- that your life is so great!
- Out.

1018
01:07:58,453 --> 01:08:01,164
Wait!
Fine! I apologize!

1019
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:04,418
I wasn't trying to ruin your life!

1020
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:07,880
Some of us have bigger problems...

1021
01:08:08,046 --> 01:08:10,549
you selfish, entitled princess!

1022
01:08:10,716 --> 01:08:11,967
"Selfish"?

1023
01:08:12,134 --> 01:08:16,889
I've been stuck being perfect
my whole entire life!

1024
01:08:17,055 --> 01:08:20,850
And literally, the only thing you have ever
done for me is mess things up!

1025
01:08:21,018 --> 01:08:24,479
Nothing is messed up!
You can still marry that big dumb hunk!

1026
01:08:24,645 --> 01:08:28,524
I never wanted to marry him!
I was doing it for the family!

1027
01:08:30,861 --> 01:08:32,279
Oh, my gosh.

1028
01:08:32,738 --> 01:08:33,779
Isa...

1029
01:08:33,947 --> 01:08:37,576
that is a very serious confession.

1030
01:08:38,868 --> 01:08:40,412

<i>Abuela</i>? It's okay! Everything's...

1095
01:11:44,179 --> 01:11:45,889
We're gonna save the miracle.
The magic...

1096
01:11:46,056 --> 01:11:47,516
What are you talking about?

1097
01:11:47,683 --> 01:11:50,018
Look at our home! Look at your sister!

1098
01:11:50,185 --> 01:11:53,230
Please just...
Isabela wasn't happy.

1099
01:11:53,438 --> 01:11:55,566
Of course she isn't happy.
You ruined her proposal.

1100
01:11:55,732 --> 01:11:58,026
No, no, no.
She needed me to ruin her proposal.

1101
01:11:58,193 --> 01:11:59,695
And then we did all this!

1102
01:11:59,862 --> 01:12:00,988
And the candle burned brighter
and the cracks...

1103
01:12:01,154 --> 01:12:02,823
- Mirabel.
- That's why I'm in the vision!

1104
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:04,241
I'm saving the miracle!

1105
01:12:04,408 --> 01:12:06,785
You have to stop, Mirabel!

1106
01:12:09,621 --> 01:12:11,790
The cracks started with you.

1107
01:12:12,374 --> 01:12:14,751
Bruno left because of you.

1108
01:12:14,918 --> 01:12:18,380
Luisa's losing her powers.
Isabela's out of control.

1109
01:12:18,547 --> 01:12:20,215
Because of you!

1110
01:12:20,382 --> 01:12:23,135
I don't know why you
weren't given a Gift...

1111
01:12:23,302 --> 01:12:27,181
but it is not an excuse
for you to hurt this family.

1112
01:12:37,399 --> 01:12:42,154
I will never be good enough for you.

1113
01:12:43,197 --> 01:12:44,281
Will I?

1114
01:12:47,159 --> 01:12:50,454
No matter how hard I try.

1115
01:12:55,501 --> 01:12:59,671
No matter how hard any of us tries.

1116
01:13:00,631 --> 01:13:04,009
Luisa will never be strong enough.

1117
01:13:04,176 --> 01:13:07,221
Isabela won't be perfect enough.

1118
01:13:07,387 --> 01:13:10,224
Bruno left our family because
you only saw the worst in him.

1119
01:13:10,390 --> 01:13:12,434
Bruno didn't care about this family.

1120
01:13:12,601 --> 01:13:13,977
He loves this family.

1121
01:13:14,144 --> 01:13:17,981
I love this family.
We all love this family.

1122
01:13:18,148 --> 01:13:19,900
You're the one that doesn't care.

1123
01:13:20,442 --> 01:13:23,028
- You're the one breaking our home.
- Don't you ever...

1124
01:13:23,195 --> 01:13:25,864
The miracle is dying, because of you.

1125
01:13:31,161 --> 01:13:32,204
No, no, no!

1126
01:13:33,956 --> 01:13:34,790
The candle!

1127
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:43,257
<i>Casita!</i> Get me up there!

1128

1130
01:14:17,165 --> 01:14:18,166
Careful, Antonio!

1131
01:14:19,209 --> 01:14:20,460
We gotta get out of here!

1132
01:14:20,627 --> 01:14:22,462

1133
01:14:23,046 --> 01:14:25,424

01:14:37,686 --> 01:14:39,104
Mirabel, leave it!

1136
01:14:43,358 --> 01:14:46,653
Mirabel! The house is going to fall!

1137
01:14:49,364 --> 01:14:51,783
- Mirabel, get out!
- Mirabel!

1138
01:15:20,938 --> 01:15:21,980
No.

1139
01:15:32,908 --> 01:15:34,201
Mirabel!

1140
01:15:35,786 --> 01:15:38,121
Mirabel, are you hurt?

1141
01:15:41,291 --> 01:15:42,417

Don't move.
I'll be right back.

1145
01:15:50,259 --> 01:15:52,469
How did this happen?

1146
01:15:52,636 --> 01:15:55,180
Here, let me help you.
Let me help you.

1147
01:15:55,347 --> 01:15:58,183
- Everyone okay?
- Antonio, don't cry, <i>papito.</i>

1148
01:15:58,433 --> 01:16:01,728
How is this possible?
The <i>encanto's</i> broken.

1149
01:16:01,895 --> 01:16:03,146
What do we do now?

1150
01:16:03,355 --> 01:16:05,232
My powers. They're gone.

1151
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:07,484
What about Antonio?
What is he gonna do?

1152
01:16:12,781 --> 01:16:14,616

I'm sorry.

1166
01:17:26,188 --> 01:17:28,482
I didn't want to hurt us.

1167
01:17:29,441 --> 01:17:31,652
I just wanted...

1168
01:17:32,444 --> 01:17:35,072
to be something I'm not.

1169
01:17:50,003 --> 01:17:53,632
