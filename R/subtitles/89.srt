1
00:00:22,299 --> 00:00:25,589
<i>I killed Sirius Black!</i>

2
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,529
<i>He's back.</i>

3
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:58,501
<i>The police are
continuing with the investigation...</i>

4
00:02:58,586 --> 00:03:00,791
<i>...into the cause
of the Millennium Bridge disaster.</i>

5
00:03:01,094 --> 00:03:04,794
<i>Traffic has been halted
as police search for survivors.</i>

6
00:03:04,887 --> 00:03:06,925
<i>The surrounding area remains closed.</i>

7
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:09,538
<i>The mayor has urged Londoners
to remain calm...</i>

8
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,751
"Harry Potter."

9
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,083
Who's Harry Potter?

10
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,493
Oh, no one.

11
00:03:23,128 --> 00:03:24,312
Bit of a tosser, really.

12
00:03:26,887 --> 00:03:28,197
Funny, that paper of yours.

13
00:03:28,812 --> 00:03:31,182
Couple nights ago,
I could've sworn I saw a picture move.

14
00:03:31,267 --> 00:03:33,459
- Really?
- Thought I was going around the twist.

15
00:03:41,072 --> 00:03:44,510
- Hey, I was wondering...
- Eleven. That's when I get off.

16
00:03:45,713 --> 00:03:47,638
You can tell me all about
that tosser Harry Potter.

17
00:04:39,407 --> 00:04:41,100
You've been reckless this summer, Harry.

18
00:04:41,874 --> 00:04:43,351
I like riding around on trains.

19
00:04:45,267 --> 00:04:46,484
Takes my mind off things.

20
00:04:48,748 --> 00:04:50,505
Rather unpleasant to behold, isn't it?

21
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:53,840
The tale is thrilling, if I say so myself.

22
00:04:54,368 --> 00:04:56,165
But now is not the time to tell it.

23
00:04:57,065 --> 00:04:58,074
Take my arm.

24
00:05:01,893 --> 00:05:02,838
Do as I say.

25
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:14,233
I just Apparated, didn't I?

26
00:05:14,403 --> 00:05:17,320
Indeed. Quite successfully too,
I might add.

27
00:05:17,663 --> 00:05:19,412
Most people vomit the first time.

28
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:21,437
I can't imagine why.

29
00:05:29,906 --> 00:05:32,792
Welcome to the
charming village of Budleigh Babberton.

30
00:05:33,922 --> 00:05:35,241
Harry, I assume, right about now,

31
00:05:35,326 --> 00:05:37,827
you must be wondering
why I brought you here.

32
00:05:38,368 --> 00:05:39,282
Am I right?

33
00:05:40,262 --> 00:05:42,809
Actually, sir, after all these years,
I just sort of go with it.

34
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,120
Wands out, Harry.

35
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,290
<i>Horace?</i>

36
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:15,884
Horace?

37
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,067
Merlin's beard!

38
00:07:11,304 --> 00:07:13,388
No need to disfigure me, Albus.

39
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,375
Well, I must say you
make a very convincing armchair, Horace.

40
00:07:18,365 --> 00:07:20,315
It's all in the upholstery.

41
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,768
I come by the stuffing naturally.
What gave me away?

42
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:24,478
Dragon's blood.

43
00:07:27,485 --> 00:07:28,835
Oh, yes, introductions.

44
00:07:29,254 --> 00:07:32,879
Harry, I'd like you to meet
an old friend and colleague of mine...

45
00:07:33,304 --> 00:07:34,383
...Horace Slughorn.

46
00:07:35,044 --> 00:07:35,939
Horace...

47
00:07:36,714 --> 00:07:38,546
...well, you know who this is.

48
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,557
Harry Potter.

49
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,891
What's with all the theatrics, Horace?

50
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,488
You weren't, by any chance,
waiting for someone else, were you?

51
00:07:49,685 --> 00:07:51,385
Someone else?
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.

52
00:07:52,778 --> 00:07:56,120
All right, the Death Eaters have been
trying to recruit me for over a year.

53
00:07:56,205 --> 00:07:57,102
Do you know what that's like?

54
00:07:57,378 --> 00:07:59,401
You can only say no so many times,

55
00:07:59,486 --> 00:08:01,202
so I never stay anywhere more than a week.

56
00:08:01,943 --> 00:08:04,073
Muggles who own this
are in the Canary Islands.

57
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:08,262
Well, I think we should put it back
in order for them, don't you? Mind.

58
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,758
That was fun.

59
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,752
- Do you mind if I use the loo?
- No, of course.

60
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,621
Don't think I don't know
why you're here, Albus.

61
00:08:53,706 --> 00:08:58,611
The answer's still no.
Absolutely and unequivocally, no.

62
00:09:07,592 --> 00:09:08,925
You're very like your father.

63
00:09:10,815 --> 00:09:11,888
Except for the eyes of course.

64
00:09:11,973 --> 00:09:13,408
- You have your...
- My mother's eyes. Yeah.

65
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:17,222
Lily. Lovely Lily.
She was exceedingly bright, your mother.

66
00:09:17,754 --> 00:09:20,864
Even more impressive
when one considers she was Muggle-born.

67
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,976
One of my best friends is Muggle-born,
which is the best in our year.

68
00:09:24,069 --> 00:09:25,996
Please don't think I'm prejudiced.
No, no.

69
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,125
Your mother was one of
my absolute favorites.

70
00:09:29,749 --> 00:09:30,653
Look, there she is.

71
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:31,639
Right at the front.

72
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,478
All mine. Each and every one.

73
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:45,303
Ex-students, I mean.

74
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:52,060
You recognize Barnabas Cuffe,
editor of The Daily Prophet.

75
00:09:53,605 --> 00:09:56,095
Always takes my owl,
should I wish to register an opinion...

76
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,290
...on the news of the day.

77
00:09:58,409 --> 00:10:01,382
Gwenog Jones,
captain of the Holyhead Harpies.

78
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:03,223
Free tickets whenever I want them.

79
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,584
Of course, I haven't been
to a match in some time.

80
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,105
Ah, yes.

81
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,952
Regulus Black.

82
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,955
You no doubt know of his
older brother Sirius.

83
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,437
Died a few weeks ago.

84
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,673
I taught the whole Black family,
except Sirius.

85
00:10:19,758 --> 00:10:22,141
It's a shame. Talented boy.

86
00:10:22,226 --> 00:10:26,551
I got Regulus when he came along,
of course, but I'd have liked the set.

87
00:10:28,324 --> 00:10:29,198
Horace?

88
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,477
Do you mind if I take this?

89
00:10:36,396 --> 00:10:38,237
I do love knitting patterns.

90
00:10:38,322 --> 00:10:40,150
Yes, of course.
But you're not leaving, are you?

91
00:10:40,245 --> 00:10:42,527
I think I know a lost
cause when I see one.

92
00:10:42,612 --> 00:10:43,450
Regrettable.

93
00:10:43,535 --> 00:10:45,825
I would have considered it
a personal triumph...

94
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,696
...had you consented to return
to Hogwarts. Oh, well.

95
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:52,125
You're like my friend Mr. Potter here,
one of a kind.

96
00:10:52,755 --> 00:10:54,606
Well, bye-bye, Horace.

97
00:10:55,515 --> 00:10:56,439
Bye.

98
00:11:07,564 --> 00:11:09,442
All right. I'll do it.

99
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,590
But I want Professor
Merrythought's old office,

100
00:11:12,675 --> 00:11:14,675
not the water closet I had before.

101
00:11:15,234 --> 00:11:18,637
And I expect a raise.
These are mad times we live in. Mad!

102
00:11:21,244 --> 00:11:22,371
They are indeed.

103
00:11:26,293 --> 00:11:27,966
Sir, exactly what was all that about?

104
00:11:28,753 --> 00:11:33,134
You are talented, famous and powerful.
Everything Horace values.

105
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,314
Professor Slughorn is gonna try
to collect you, Harry.

106
00:11:37,173 --> 00:11:39,223
You would be his crowning jewel.

107
00:11:39,723 --> 00:11:44,253
That's why he's returning to Hogwarts.
And it's crucial he should return.

108
00:11:45,932 --> 00:11:48,939
I fear I may have stolen
a wondrous night from you, Harry.

109
00:11:49,215 --> 00:11:53,610
She was, truthfully,
very pretty, the girl.

110
00:11:54,482 --> 00:11:57,962
It's all right, sir.
I'll go back tomorrow, make some excuse.

111
00:11:58,047 --> 00:12:00,782
Oh, you'll not be returning
to Little Whinging tonight, Harry.

112
00:12:01,903 --> 00:12:04,327
But, sir, what about Hedwig?
And my trunk?

113
00:12:05,026 --> 00:12:06,915
Both are waiting for you.

114
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:42,159
Hedwig.

115
00:12:45,345 --> 00:12:46,189
Mom?

116
00:12:48,062 --> 00:12:49,332
Ginny, what is it?

117
00:12:49,776 --> 00:12:51,398
I was only wondering when Harry got here.

118
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:55,587
- What? Harry? Harry who?
- Harry Potter, of course.

119
00:12:55,672 --> 00:12:58,599
I think I'd know if Harry Potter
was in my house, wouldn't I?

120
00:12:58,684 --> 00:13:02,756
- His trunk's in the kitchen, and his owl.
- No, dear, I seriously doubt that.

121
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,461
Harry? Did someone say "Harry"?

122
00:13:06,937 --> 00:13:08,981
Me, nosy. Is he up there with you?

123
00:13:09,066 --> 00:13:12,155
Of course not. I'd know if my best friend
was in my room, wouldn't I?

124
00:13:12,535 --> 00:13:14,926
- Is that an owl?
- You haven't seen him, have you?

125
00:13:15,106 --> 00:13:16,846
Apparently, he's wandering
about the house.

126
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,328
- Really?
- Really.

127
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:19,712
Harry!

128
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:27,531
Harry!

129
00:13:30,288 --> 00:13:34,216
What a lovely surprise.

130
00:13:35,668 --> 00:13:37,876
Why didn't you let us know
you were coming?

131
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,108
- I didn't know. Dumbledore.
- Oh, that man.

132
00:13:41,193 --> 00:13:42,688
But then, what would we do without him?

133
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,631
Got a bit of toothpaste.

134
00:13:54,478 --> 00:13:55,341
So when did you get here?

135
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:56,961
A few days ago.

136
00:13:58,767 --> 00:14:00,455
Though for a while,
I wasn't sure I was coming.

137
00:14:02,897 --> 00:14:04,862
Mom sort of lost it last week.

138
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:07,971
Said Ginny and I had no business
going back to Hogwarts.

139
00:14:08,424 --> 00:14:09,782
That it's too dangerous.

140
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,288
- Oh, come on.
- She's not alone.

141
00:14:13,084 --> 00:14:15,685
Even my parents, and they're Muggles,
know something bad's happening.

142
00:14:16,567 --> 00:14:19,299
Anyway, Dad stepped in,
told her she was being barmy...

143
00:14:19,384 --> 00:14:22,381
...and it took a few days,
but she came around.

144
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,784
But this is Hogwarts we're talking about.

145
00:14:25,869 --> 00:14:27,636
It's Dumbledore. What could be safer?

146
00:14:29,053 --> 00:14:31,345
There's been a lot of
talk recently that...

147
00:14:32,985 --> 00:14:34,482
...Dumbledore's got a bit old.

148
00:14:34,567 --> 00:14:36,291
Rubbish! Well, he's only...

149
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:37,796
What is he?

150
00:14:38,563 --> 00:14:39,665
150?

151
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,046
Give or take a few years.

152
00:15:01,946 --> 00:15:05,093
Cissy! You can't do this!
He can't be trusted!

153
00:15:05,882 --> 00:15:07,239
The Dark Lord trusts him.

154
00:15:07,686 --> 00:15:09,383
The Dark Lord's mistaken.

155
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,454
Run along, Wormtail.

156
00:15:45,448 --> 00:15:47,326
I know I ought not to be here.

157
00:15:49,244 --> 00:15:52,052
The Dark Lord himself
forbade me to speak of this.

158
00:15:52,137 --> 00:15:54,850
If the Dark Lord has forbidden it,
you ought not to speak.

159
00:15:54,935 --> 00:15:58,387
Put it down, Bella.
We mustn't touch what isn't ours.

160
00:16:03,384 --> 00:16:07,175
As it so happens,
I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa.

161
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,183
You?

162
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,374
The Dark Lord told you?

163
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,039
Your sister doubts me.

164
00:16:16,005 --> 00:16:18,978
Understandable.
Over the years I've played my part well.

165
00:16:19,063 --> 00:16:23,109
So well, I've deceived
one of the greatest wizards of all time.

166
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:28,143
Dumbledore is a great wizard.
Only a fool would question it.

167
00:16:28,323 --> 00:16:30,117
I don't doubt you, Severus.

168
00:16:30,292 --> 00:16:32,682
You should be honored, Cissy.
As should Draco.

169
00:16:37,952 --> 00:16:39,087
He's just a boy.

170
00:16:40,665 --> 00:16:42,812
I can't change the Dark Lord's mind.

171
00:16:45,308 --> 00:16:48,285
But it might be possible
for me to help Draco.

172
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:53,077
- Severus.
- Swear to it.

173
00:16:57,722 --> 00:16:59,406
Make the Unbreakable Vow.

174
00:17:04,163 --> 00:17:06,533
It's just empty words.

175
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,905
He'll give it his best effort.

176
00:17:10,635 --> 00:17:12,323
But when it matters most...

177
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,742
...he'll just slither back into his hole.

178
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:23,180
Coward.

179
00:17:27,008 --> 00:17:29,874
Take out your wand.

180
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:44,970
Will you...

181
00:17:45,055 --> 00:17:47,265
...Severus Snape...

182
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:50,269
...watch over Draco Malfoy...

183
00:17:50,354 --> 00:17:54,476
...as he attempts to fulfill
the Dark Lord's wishes?

184
00:17:56,303 --> 00:17:57,179
I will.

185
00:17:59,596 --> 00:18:02,377
And will you,
to the best of your ability...

186
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:05,593
...protect him from harm?

187
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:08,502
I will.

188
00:18:11,009 --> 00:18:13,498
And if Draco should fail...

189
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:18,721
...will you yourself carry out the deed...

190
00:18:19,508 --> 00:18:23,596
...the Dark Lord
has ordered Draco to perform?

191
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,646
I will.

192
00:18:54,047 --> 00:18:57,047
Step up! Step up!
We've got Fainting Fancies!

193
00:18:57,132 --> 00:18:58,332
Nosebleed Nougats!

194
00:18:58,417 --> 00:19:01,037
- And just in time for school...
- Puking Pastilles!

195
00:19:02,846 --> 00:19:04,711
- Into the cauldron, handsome.
- Into the cauldron, handsome.

196
00:19:19,486 --> 00:19:22,481
- Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.
- A real money spinner, that one.

197
00:19:22,566 --> 00:19:24,156
Handy if you need
to make a quick getaway.

198
00:19:24,865 --> 00:19:26,605
- Hello, ladies.
- Hello, ladies.

199
00:19:26,785 --> 00:19:30,160
- Love potions, eh?
- Yeah, they really do work.

200
00:19:30,245 --> 00:19:33,575
Then again, the way we hear it, sis,
you're doing just fine on your own.

201
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,548
Meaning?

202
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:36,753
Are you not currently dating Dean Thomas?

203
00:19:37,585 --> 00:19:38,634
It's none of your business.

204
00:19:45,103 --> 00:19:46,027
How much for this?

205
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:47,503
- Five Galleons.
- Five Galleons.

206
00:19:47,925 --> 00:19:50,116
- How much for me?
- Five Galleons.

207
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,126
I'm your brother.

208
00:19:51,804 --> 00:19:52,888
- 10 Galleons.
- 10 Galleons.

209
00:19:55,757 --> 00:19:56,615
Come on, let's go.

210
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:00,676
Hi, Ron.

211
00:20:01,976 --> 00:20:02,815
Hi.

212
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,179
How are Fred and George doing it?

213
00:20:18,504 --> 00:20:19,879
Half the Alley's closed down.

214
00:20:20,705 --> 00:20:22,614
Fred reckons
people need a laugh these days.

215
00:20:23,753 --> 00:20:24,904
I reckon he's right.

216
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:28,511
Oh, no.

217
00:20:29,747 --> 00:20:31,682
Everyone got their wands
from Ollivander's.

218
00:20:44,346 --> 00:20:45,241
Harry?

219
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,610
Is it me, or do Draco and Mummy
look like two people...

220
00:20:49,695 --> 00:20:50,786
...who don't want to be followed?

221
00:22:36,877 --> 00:22:37,755
<i>Quibbler.</i>

222
00:22:40,006 --> 00:22:40,844
<i>Quibbler.</i>

223
00:22:43,427 --> 00:22:44,337
He's lovely.

224
00:22:45,092 --> 00:22:47,249
They've been known to sing
on Boxing Day, you know.

225
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:49,862
<i>- Quibbler?
- Oh, please.</i>

226
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:52,794
What's a Wrackspurt?

227
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,417
They're invisible creatures.

228
00:22:54,502 --> 00:22:56,639
They float in your ears
and make your brain go fuzzy.

229
00:22:58,316 --> 00:22:59,195
<i>Quibbler.</i>

230
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,972
So, what was Draco doing
with that weird-looking cabinet?

231
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,389
And who were all those people?

232
00:23:15,022 --> 00:23:18,208
Don't you see?
It was a ceremony, an initiation.

233
00:23:18,293 --> 00:23:20,424
Stop it, Harry.
I know where you're going with this.

234
00:23:20,509 --> 00:23:22,523
It's happened. He's one of them.

235
00:23:23,087 --> 00:23:23,936
One of what?

236
00:23:25,385 --> 00:23:28,628
Harry is under the impression
Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.

237
00:23:29,112 --> 00:23:30,032
You're barking.

238
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,840
What would You-Know-Who want
with a sod like Malfoy?

239
00:23:33,363 --> 00:23:36,752
Well, then what's he doing in Borgin
and Burkes? Browsing for furniture?

240
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:39,610
It's a creepy shop. He's a creepy bloke.

241
00:23:39,695 --> 00:23:43,146
Look, his father is a Death Eater.
It only makes sense.

242
00:23:43,735 --> 00:23:45,400
Besides, Hermione saw it
with her own eyes.

243
00:23:45,485 --> 00:23:47,991
I told you, I don't know what I saw.

244
00:23:50,454 --> 00:23:51,339
I need some air.

245
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:36,036
- What was that? Blaise?
- Don't know.

246
00:24:36,412 --> 00:24:38,956
Relax, boys. It's probably just
a first-year messing around.

247
00:24:39,606 --> 00:24:42,331
Come on, Draco. Sit down.
We'll be at Hogwarts soon.

248
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:55,890
Hogwarts.
What a pathetic excuse for a school.

249
00:24:56,809 --> 00:24:58,688
I think I'd pitch myself off
the Astronomy Tower...

250
00:24:58,773 --> 00:25:00,611
...if I had to continue
for another two years.

251
00:25:00,704 --> 00:25:01,961
What's that supposed to mean?

252
00:25:03,667 --> 00:25:07,378
Let's just say you won't see me wasting
my time in Charms class next year.

253
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,514
Amused, Blaise?

254
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,298
We'll see just who's laughing in the end.

255
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,077
You two go on. I wanna check something.

256
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,044
Where's Harry?

257
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,628
He's probably already on the platform.
Come on.

258
00:26:03,249 --> 00:26:06,749
Didn't Mummy ever tell you
it was rude to eavesdrop, Potter?

259
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,002
<i>Petrificus Totalus.</i>

260
00:26:21,522 --> 00:26:24,171
...she was dead before you could wipe
the drool off your chin.

261
00:26:30,438 --> 00:26:31,608
That's for my father.

262
00:26:32,117 --> 00:26:33,692
Enjoy your ride back to London.

263
00:27:17,446 --> 00:27:18,378
<i>Finite.</i>

264
00:27:25,237 --> 00:27:26,651
- Hello, Harry.
- Luna!

265
00:27:26,947 --> 00:27:27,995
How'd you know where I was?

266
00:27:28,283 --> 00:27:30,835
Wrackspurts. Your head's full of them.

267
00:27:38,303 --> 00:27:40,832
Sorry I made you miss
the carriages, by the way, Luna.

268
00:27:41,183 --> 00:27:43,995
That's all right.
It was like being with a friend.

269
00:27:44,517 --> 00:27:45,824
Oh, I am your friend, Luna.

270
00:27:46,969 --> 00:27:47,816
That's nice.

271
00:27:48,936 --> 00:27:51,882
About time.
I've been looking all over for you two.

272
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,445
Right. Names?

273
00:27:55,396 --> 00:27:57,333
Professor Flitwick,
you've known me for five years.

274
00:27:57,946 --> 00:27:59,693
No exceptions, Potter.

275
00:28:00,544 --> 00:28:01,577
Who are those people?

276
00:28:02,536 --> 00:28:04,816
Aurors. For security.

277
00:28:04,996 --> 00:28:06,456
What's this cane here, then?

278
00:28:06,746 --> 00:28:09,010
It's not a cane, you cretin.
It's a walking stick.

279
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,583
And what exactly would you
be wanting with a...?

280
00:28:14,335 --> 00:28:17,157
Could be construed
as an offensive weapon.

281
00:28:17,585 --> 00:28:22,268
It's all right, Mr. Filch.
I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy.

282
00:28:30,265 --> 00:28:31,336
Nice face, Potter.

283
00:28:38,829 --> 00:28:40,225
Would you like me to fix it for you?

284
00:28:41,313 --> 00:28:44,432
Personally, I think you look
a bit more devil-may-care this way...

285
00:28:44,533 --> 00:28:45,797
...but it's up to you.

286
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,592
Well, have you ever fixed a nose before?

287
00:28:49,614 --> 00:28:53,314
No, but I've done several toes,
and how different are they, really?

288
00:28:55,814 --> 00:28:57,397
Okay, yeah. Give it a go.

289
00:29:00,713 --> 00:29:01,578
<i>Episkey.</i>

290
00:29:08,883 --> 00:29:09,930
How do I look?

291
00:29:10,507 --> 00:29:12,182
Exceptionally ordinary.

292
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:13,994
Brilliant.

293
00:29:21,902 --> 00:29:23,973
Don't worry. He'll be here in a minute.

294
00:29:27,885 --> 00:29:30,224
Will you stop eating?

295
00:29:30,742 --> 00:29:32,350
Your best friend is missing!

296
00:29:33,042 --> 00:29:35,680
Oi. Turn around, you lunatic.

297
00:29:39,453 --> 00:29:40,702
He's covered in blood again.

298
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:42,845
Why is it he's always covered in blood?

299
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:44,909
Looks like it's his own this time.

300
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:46,753
Where have you been?

301
00:29:47,739 --> 00:29:49,371
- What happened to your face?
- Later.

302
00:29:50,379 --> 00:29:51,309
What've I missed?

303
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:55,524
Sorting Hat urged us all to be brave
and strong in these troubled times.

304
00:29:56,335 --> 00:29:59,065
Easy for it to say, huh?
It's a hat, isn't it?

305
00:30:08,126 --> 00:30:10,151
- <i>Very best of evenings to you all.</i>
- Thanks.

306
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:16,928
First off, let me introduce
the newest member of our staff...

307
00:30:17,767 --> 00:30:19,120
...Horace Slughorn.

308
00:30:23,862 --> 00:30:25,777
Professor Slughorn, I'm happy to say...

309
00:30:25,862 --> 00:30:29,643
...has agreed to resume
his old post as Potions Master.

310
00:30:30,415 --> 00:30:33,412
Meanwhile, the post of
Defense Against the Dark Arts...

311
00:30:33,497 --> 00:30:35,538
...will be taken by Professor Snape.

312
00:30:35,738 --> 00:30:36,759
Snape?

313
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:44,222
Now, as you know...

314
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:47,990
...each and every one of you was searched
upon your arrival here tonight.

315
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,177
And you have the right to know why.

316
00:30:51,564 --> 00:30:55,311
Once there was a young man,
who, like you...

317
00:30:55,396 --> 00:30:56,980
...sat in this very hall...

318
00:30:58,178 --> 00:31:02,057
...walked this castle's corridors,
slept under its roof.

319
00:31:03,379 --> 00:31:07,074
He seemed to all the world
a student like any other.

320
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,874
His name?

321
00:31:10,985 --> 00:31:12,001
Tom Riddle.

322
00:31:17,495 --> 00:31:18,472
Today, of course...

323
00:31:19,705 --> 00:31:22,092
...he's known all over the world
by another name.

324
00:31:24,214 --> 00:31:28,439
Which is why, as I stand looking out
upon you all tonight...

325
00:31:29,594 --> 00:31:31,448
...I'm reminded of a sobering fact.

326
00:31:33,134 --> 00:31:35,682
<i>Every day, every hour...</i>

327
00:31:36,434 --> 00:31:37,982
<i>...this very minute, perhaps...</i>

328
00:31:38,554 --> 00:31:42,180
<i>...dark forces attempt to penetrate
this castle's walls.</i>

329
00:31:44,484 --> 00:31:49,434
But in the end,
their greatest weapon is you.

330
00:31:53,113 --> 00:31:54,386
Just something to think about.

331
00:31:56,493 --> 00:31:57,785
Now, off to bed. Pip-pip.

332
00:31:59,743 --> 00:32:00,709
That was cheerful.

333
00:32:07,004 --> 00:32:10,766
History of Magic is upstairs,
ladies, not down.

334
00:32:12,452 --> 00:32:16,758
Mr. Davies! Mr. Davies!
That is the girls' lavatory.

335
00:32:20,269 --> 00:32:21,112
<i>Potter.</i>

336
00:32:23,026 --> 00:32:24,056
Oh, this can't be good.

337
00:32:28,192 --> 00:32:29,562
Enjoying ourselves, are we?

338
00:32:30,474 --> 00:32:32,179
I had a free period
this morning, Professor.

339
00:32:32,272 --> 00:32:33,244
So I noticed.

340
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:36,696
I would think you would want to
fill it with Potions.

341
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,451
Or is it no longer your ambition
to become an Auror?

342
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,440
It was, but I was told I had to
get an "Outstanding" in my OWL.

343
00:32:43,525 --> 00:32:46,996
So you did, when Professor Snape
was teaching Potions.

344
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:51,661
However, Professor Slughorn is perfectly
happy to accept NEWT students...

345
00:32:51,746 --> 00:32:53,597
...with "Exceeds Expectations."

346
00:32:54,202 --> 00:32:55,051
Brilliant.

347
00:32:56,032 --> 00:32:57,953
- Well, I'll head there straightaway.
- Oh, good, good.

348
00:32:58,512 --> 00:33:02,600
Potter, take Weasley with you.
He looks far too happy over there.

349
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,590
I don't wanna take Potions.

350
00:33:06,675 --> 00:33:08,785
This is Quidditch trials coming up.
I need to practice.

351
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:12,263
Attention to detail
in the preparation...

352
00:33:12,348 --> 00:33:15,092
...is the prerequisite of all planning.

353
00:33:18,213 --> 00:33:20,051
Harry, my boy, I was beginning to worry.

354
00:33:20,283 --> 00:33:22,047
We've brought someone with us, I see.

355
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,939
Ron Weasley, sir.

356
00:33:24,473 --> 00:33:27,018
But I'm dead awful at Potions,
a menace, actually.

357
00:33:27,103 --> 00:33:29,284
- I'm probably just...
- Nonsense, we'll sort you out.

358
00:33:29,369 --> 00:33:32,017
Any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine.
Get your books out.

359
00:33:32,324 --> 00:33:35,082
Sorry, sir. I haven't actually got
my book yet, and nor has Ron.

360
00:33:35,288 --> 00:33:36,975
Not to worry.
Get what you want from the cupboard.

361
00:33:37,209 --> 00:33:40,634
Now, as I was saying,
I prepared some concoctions this morning.

362
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:44,765
Any ideas what these might be?

363
00:33:46,179 --> 00:33:47,955
- Yes, Miss...?
- Granger, sir.

364
00:33:52,018 --> 00:33:55,970
That one there is Veritaserum.
It's a truth-telling serum.

365
00:33:56,703 --> 00:33:59,403
And that would be Polyjuice Potion.

366
00:34:02,988 --> 00:34:04,648
It's terribly tricky to make.

367
00:34:04,818 --> 00:34:05,919
And this is Amortentia...

368
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:08,672
...the most powerful
love potion in the world.

369
00:34:10,462 --> 00:34:13,455
It's rumored to smell differently to each
person according to what attracts them.

370
00:34:15,497 --> 00:34:16,717
For example, I smell...

371
00:34:18,247 --> 00:34:21,540
...freshly mown grass,
and new parchment, and...

372
00:34:22,467 --> 00:34:25,121
...spearmint toothpaste.

373
00:34:27,185 --> 00:34:30,851
Amortentia doesn't create actual love.
That would be impossible.

374
00:34:30,936 --> 00:34:35,725
But it does cause
a powerful infatuation or obsession.

375
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:42,154
And for that reason, it is probably
the most dangerous potion in this room.

376
00:34:48,236 --> 00:34:51,026
Sir? You haven't told us
what's in that one.

377
00:34:51,406 --> 00:34:52,652
Oh, yes.

378
00:34:53,333 --> 00:34:55,903
What you see before you,
ladies and gentlemen...

379
00:34:55,988 --> 00:35:00,819
...is a curious little potion
known as Felix Felicis.

380
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:04,210
But it is more commonly referred to as...

381
00:35:04,295 --> 00:35:09,053
- Liquid luck.
- Yes, Miss Granger. Liquid luck.

382
00:35:10,095 --> 00:35:13,250
Desperately tricky to make,
disastrous should you get it wrong.

383
00:35:13,813 --> 00:35:18,268
One sip and you will find
that all of your endeavors succeed.

384
00:35:20,935 --> 00:35:22,750
At least until the effects wear off.

385
00:35:24,274 --> 00:35:27,427
So this is what I offer each of you today.

386
00:35:27,988 --> 00:35:31,383
One tiny vial of liquid luck
to the student who,

387
00:35:31,468 --> 00:35:33,110
in the hour that remains...

388
00:35:33,195 --> 00:35:37,018
...manages to brew an acceptable
Draught of Living Death...

389
00:35:37,978 --> 00:35:40,740
...the recipes for which can be found
on page 10 of your books.

390
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,800
I should point out, however,

391
00:35:42,885 --> 00:35:45,209
only once did a student
manage to brew a potion...

392
00:35:45,294 --> 00:35:47,712
...of sufficient quality
to claim this prize.

393
00:35:49,293 --> 00:35:51,374
Nevertheless, good luck to you all.

394
00:35:52,279 --> 00:35:53,540
Let the brewing commence.

395
00:36:30,005 --> 00:36:31,161
How did you do that?

396
00:36:32,603 --> 00:36:33,827
Crush it. Don't cut it.

397
00:36:34,672 --> 00:36:37,335
No. The instructions
specifically say to cut.

398
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,376
No, really.

399
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:19,840
Merlin's beard! It is perfect.

400
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:24,086
So perfect I daresay
one drop would kill us all.

401
00:37:27,809 --> 00:37:29,882
So here we are, then, as promised.

402
00:37:29,967 --> 00:37:32,702
One vial of Felix Felicis.

403
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:34,779
Congratulations.

404
00:37:35,899 --> 00:37:37,883
Use it well.

405
00:38:06,138 --> 00:38:08,390
Harry, you got my message. Come in.

406
00:38:10,502 --> 00:38:11,446
How are you?

407
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:12,957
I'm fine, sir.

408
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,160
Enjoying your classes?

409
00:38:16,357 --> 00:38:18,736
I know Professor Slughorn
is most impressed with you.

410
00:38:20,147 --> 00:38:22,299
I think he overestimates
my abilities, sir.

411
00:38:23,133 --> 00:38:23,980
Do you?

412
00:38:24,777 --> 00:38:25,631
Definitely.

413
00:38:28,068 --> 00:38:30,537
What about your activities
outside the classroom?

414
00:38:32,077 --> 00:38:34,162
- Sir?
- Well, I notice you spend...

415
00:38:34,247 --> 00:38:36,452
...a great deal of time with Miss Granger.

416
00:38:37,046 --> 00:38:38,286
I can't help wondering if...

417
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:43,204
Oh, no, no. I mean, she's brilliant,
and we're friends, but, no.

418
00:38:43,289 --> 00:38:45,985
Forgive me. I was merely being curious.

419
00:38:47,667 --> 00:38:48,964
But enough chitchat.

420
00:38:49,806 --> 00:38:52,656
You must be wondering
why I summoned you here tonight.

421
00:38:53,976 --> 00:38:56,013
The answer lies here.

422
00:38:57,776 --> 00:38:59,434
What you are looking at are memories.

423
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:03,541
In this case,
pertaining to one individual, Voldemort...

424
00:39:04,155 --> 00:39:06,339
...or, as he was known then, Tom Riddle.

425
00:39:09,655 --> 00:39:12,387
This vial contains
the most particular memory...

426
00:39:13,665 --> 00:39:15,111
...of the day I first met him.

427
00:39:17,205 --> 00:39:19,549
I'd like you to see it, if you would.

428
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:01,538
<i>I must admit there is some confusion upon
receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore.</i>

429
00:40:02,203 --> 00:40:05,640
In all the years Tom's been here,
he's never once had a family visitor.

430
00:40:05,725 --> 00:40:08,027
There have been incidents
with the other children.

431
00:40:08,112 --> 00:40:09,536
Nasty things.

432
00:40:12,012 --> 00:40:13,669
Tom, you have a visitor.

433
00:40:14,722 --> 00:40:15,729
How do you do, Tom?

434
00:40:23,892 --> 00:40:24,807
Don't.

435
00:40:32,957 --> 00:40:35,095
- You're the doctor, aren't you?
- No.

436
00:40:36,287 --> 00:40:37,639
I am a professor.

437
00:40:38,942 --> 00:40:39,991
I don't believe you.

438
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:42,241
She wants me looked at.

439
00:40:43,469 --> 00:40:45,798
They think I'm different.

440
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:47,104
Well, perhaps they're right.

441
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,722
I'm not mad.

442
00:40:49,219 --> 00:40:51,776
Hogwarts is not a place for mad people.

443
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,117
Hogwarts is a school.

444
00:40:55,455 --> 00:40:56,615
A school of magic.

445
00:41:01,203 --> 00:41:03,235
You can do things, can't you, Tom?

446
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,993
Things other children can't.

447
00:41:09,052 --> 00:41:11,305
I can make things move
without touching them.

448
00:41:12,948 --> 00:41:15,796
I can make animals do what I want
without training them.

449
00:41:17,304 --> 00:41:20,095
I can make bad things happen
to people who are mean to me.

450
00:41:21,699 --> 00:41:22,930
I can make them hurt...

451
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:24,991
...if I want.

452
00:41:26,127 --> 00:41:27,112
Who are you?

453
00:41:28,249 --> 00:41:29,649
Well, I'm like you, Tom.

454
00:41:31,629 --> 00:41:32,632
I'm different.

455
00:41:34,129 --> 00:41:35,052
Prove it.

456
00:41:43,275 --> 00:41:46,011
I think there's something in your wardrobe
trying to get out, Tom.

457
00:41:56,608 --> 00:41:59,359
Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts,
Tom.

458
00:42:00,617 --> 00:42:05,402
At Hogwarts, you'll be taught not only
how to use magic, but how to control it.

459
00:42:06,536 --> 00:42:07,465
You understand me?

460
00:42:11,707 --> 00:42:13,346
I can speak to snakes too.

461
00:42:15,417 --> 00:42:16,475
They find me.

462
00:42:18,207 --> 00:42:19,292
Whisper things.

463
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,722
Is that normal for someone like me?

464
00:42:44,566 --> 00:42:47,611
Did you know, sir? Then?

465
00:42:47,996 --> 00:42:51,438
Did I know I'd just met the most
dangerous dark wizard of all time?

466
00:42:52,208 --> 00:42:53,053
No.

467
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,794
If I had, I...

468
00:42:57,996 --> 00:42:59,735
Over time, while here at Hogwarts...

469
00:43:00,625 --> 00:43:03,245
...Tom Riddle grew close
to one particular teacher.

470
00:43:04,135 --> 00:43:05,777
Can you guess
who that teacher might be?

471
00:43:09,028 --> 00:43:12,392
You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back
simply to teach Potions, did you?

472
00:43:12,477 --> 00:43:13,711
No, I did not.

473
00:43:14,669 --> 00:43:18,660
You see, Professor Slughorn possesses
something I desire very dearly.

474
00:43:19,565 --> 00:43:21,217
And he will not give it up easily.

475
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:24,031
You said Professor Slughorn
would try to collect me.

476
00:43:24,904 --> 00:43:25,820
I did.

477
00:43:27,136 --> 00:43:28,239
Do you want me to let him?

478
00:43:30,324 --> 00:43:31,230
Yes.

479
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:56,695
All right. Um...

480
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:00,820
This morning, I'm gonna be
putting you all through a few drills...

481
00:45:00,905 --> 00:45:02,400
...just to assess your strengths.

482
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:05,042
Quiet! Please!

483
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,086
Shut it!

484
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,582
Thanks. All right.

485
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,040
Just because you
made the team last year...

486
00:45:16,125 --> 00:45:17,906
...does not guarantee you
a spot this year.

487
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:18,840
Is that clear?

488
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:22,525
Good.

489
00:45:31,799 --> 00:45:33,001
No hard feelings, Weasley, all right?

490
00:45:34,439 --> 00:45:35,331
Hard feelings?

491
00:45:35,819 --> 00:45:36,953
Yeah, I'll be going out
for Keeper as well.

492
00:45:37,038 --> 00:45:38,632
It's nothing personal.

493
00:45:39,636 --> 00:45:42,306
Really? Strapping guy like you?

494
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:44,086
You've got more of a Beater's build,
don't you think?

495
00:45:45,139 --> 00:45:47,270
Keepers need to be quick, agile.

496
00:45:48,906 --> 00:45:50,066
Oh, I like my chances.

497
00:45:50,985 --> 00:45:54,059
Say, think you could introduce me
to your friend Granger?

498
00:45:54,825 --> 00:45:58,118
Wouldn't mind getting on
a first-name basis, know what I mean?

499
00:46:11,176 --> 00:46:12,356
Come on, Weasley!

500
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,329
- Come on, Ron!
- Go on, Weasley!

501
00:46:16,544 --> 00:46:18,839
- Go on, Weasley!
- Yeah, Ron!

502
00:46:19,594 --> 00:46:20,582
Go on, Cormac!

503
00:46:37,363 --> 00:46:38,572
Come on, Ron!

504
00:46:50,123 --> 00:46:51,013
Come on, Ron.

505
00:47:09,892 --> 00:47:10,862
<i>Confundus.</i>

506
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,512
Isn't he brilliant?

507
00:47:32,082 --> 00:47:34,737
I have to admit, I thought
I was gonna miss that last one.

508
00:47:36,016 --> 00:47:38,087
I hope Cormac's not taking it too hard.

509
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:41,538
He's got a bit of a thing for you,
Hermione. Cormac.

510
00:47:43,498 --> 00:47:44,438
He's vile.

511
00:47:50,215 --> 00:47:52,725
Have you ever heard of this spell? Sectumsempra?

512
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:54,006
No, I haven't.

513
00:47:54,964 --> 00:47:57,426
And if you had a shred of self-respect,
you'd hand that book in.

514
00:47:58,183 --> 00:48:00,719
Not bloody likely. He's top of the class.

515
00:48:00,804 --> 00:48:02,199
He's even better than you, Hermione.

516
00:48:02,789 --> 00:48:04,177
Slughorn thinks he's a genius.

517
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:07,181
What?

518
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:09,916
I'd like to know whose that book was.

519
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:11,821
- Let's have a look, shall we?
- No.

520
00:48:14,154 --> 00:48:15,046
Why not?

521
00:48:15,992 --> 00:48:17,284
The binding is fragile.

522
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:20,191
- The binding is fragile?
- Yeah.

523
00:48:24,759 --> 00:48:26,366
- Who's the Half-Blood Prince?
- Who?

524
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:27,748
That's what it says right here.

525
00:48:27,833 --> 00:48:29,621
"This book is property
of the Half-Blood Prince."

526
00:48:47,648 --> 00:48:51,012
<i>For weeks you carry around
this book, practically sleep with it...</i>

527
00:48:51,097 --> 00:48:53,377
<i>...and yet you have no desire to find out
who the half-blood prince is?</i>

528
00:48:53,462 --> 00:48:56,872
I didn't say I wasn't curious,
and I don't sleep with it.

529
00:48:57,126 --> 00:48:58,131
Well, it's true.

530
00:48:58,216 --> 00:48:59,921
I like a nice chat before I go to bed.

531
00:49:00,006 --> 00:49:01,553
Now all you do is read that bloody book.

532
00:49:02,057 --> 00:49:03,530
It's just like being with Hermione.

533
00:49:05,474 --> 00:49:08,204
Well, I was curious, so I went to...

534
00:49:08,289 --> 00:49:09,922
- The library.
- The library. And?

535
00:49:11,653 --> 00:49:12,571
And nothing.

536
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:16,585
I couldn't find a reference anywhere
to a Half-Blood Prince.

537
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:18,495
- There we go. That settles it, then.
- Filius!

538
00:49:19,017 --> 00:49:21,078
I was hoping to find you
in the Three Broomsticks!

539
00:49:21,453 --> 00:49:25,351
No, emergency choir practice,
I'm afraid, Horace.

540
00:49:29,686 --> 00:49:30,866
Does anyone fancy a Butterbeer?

541
00:49:31,819 --> 00:49:34,709
A chum of mine
was sledging down Claxby Hill.

542
00:49:34,794 --> 00:49:38,490
We had a very long, homemade,
Norwegian-style sledge...

543
00:49:38,575 --> 00:49:40,052
No, not there. Over here.

544
00:49:41,714 --> 00:49:42,695
No, sit beside me.

545
00:49:44,885 --> 00:49:45,740
Okay.

546
00:49:47,796 --> 00:49:48,635
Something to drink?

547
00:49:49,398 --> 00:49:51,584
Three Butterbeers,
and some ginger in mine, please.

548
00:50:03,635 --> 00:50:04,743
Oh, bloody hell.

549
00:50:08,503 --> 00:50:09,684
Slick git.

550
00:50:10,473 --> 00:50:12,612
Honestly, Ronald,
they're only holding hands.

551
00:50:16,075 --> 00:50:17,015
And snogging.

552
00:50:18,018 --> 00:50:19,867
- I'd like to leave.
- What?

553
00:50:21,196 --> 00:50:22,545
You can't be serious.

554
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:24,916
- That happens to be my sister.
- So?

555
00:50:25,652 --> 00:50:27,189
What if she looked over here
and saw you snogging me?

556
00:50:27,283 --> 00:50:28,790
You expect her to leave?

557
00:50:30,794 --> 00:50:33,329
- Hey, my boy!
- Hello, sir. Wonderful to see you.

558
00:50:33,414 --> 00:50:35,391
And you, and you.

559
00:50:35,476 --> 00:50:36,486
So, what brings you here?

560
00:50:37,416 --> 00:50:41,188
The Three Broomsticks and I go way back,
further than I care to admit.

561
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,877
I can remember
when it was One Broomstick.

562
00:50:45,964 --> 00:50:49,478
All hands on deck, Granger.
Listen, my boy, in the old days,

563
00:50:49,563 --> 00:50:52,844
I used to throw together
the occasional supper party...

564
00:50:52,929 --> 00:50:54,894
...for the select student or two.

565
00:50:55,379 --> 00:50:56,365
Would you be game?

566
00:50:57,164 --> 00:50:58,920
I'd consider it an honor, sir.

567
00:51:00,687 --> 00:51:02,070
You would be welcome too, Granger.

568
00:51:03,822 --> 00:51:07,578
- I'd be delighted, sir.
- Splendid. Look for my owl.

569
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:10,957
Good to see you, Wallenby.

570
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,234
What are you playing at?

571
00:51:19,699 --> 00:51:21,474
Dumbledore's asked me
to get to know him.

572
00:51:22,198 --> 00:51:23,763
- Get to know him?
- I don't know.

573
00:51:24,343 --> 00:51:25,631
It must be important.

574
00:51:25,716 --> 00:51:27,203
If it wasn't, Dumbledore wouldn't ask.

575
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:34,854
Got a little bit...

576
00:51:47,077 --> 00:51:48,637
Katie, you don't know what it could be.

577
00:51:48,722 --> 00:51:50,285
- Harry.
- What?

578
00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:53,036
Did you hear what she said back
at the pub about me and her snogging?

579
00:51:54,813 --> 00:51:55,663
As if.

580
00:52:02,825 --> 00:52:05,843
I warned her.
I warned her not to touch it.

581
00:52:27,603 --> 00:52:30,738
Don't get any closer.
Get back, all of you.

582
00:52:42,538 --> 00:52:45,475
Do not touch that,
except by the wrappings.

583
00:52:46,099 --> 00:52:47,042
Do you understand?

584
00:53:01,347 --> 00:53:03,927
You're sure Katie did not have this
in her possession...

585
00:53:04,012 --> 00:53:05,951
...when she entered
the Three Broomsticks?

586
00:53:07,054 --> 00:53:08,042
It's like I said.

587
00:53:08,987 --> 00:53:10,368
She left to go to the loo,

588
00:53:11,089 --> 00:53:13,060
and when she came back
she had the package.

589
00:53:15,165 --> 00:53:17,136
She said it was important
that she deliver it.

590
00:53:18,586 --> 00:53:21,314
- Did she say to whom?
- To Professor Dumbledore.

591
00:53:22,465 --> 00:53:24,319
Very well. Thank you, Leanne.
You may go.

592
00:53:29,812 --> 00:53:34,947
Why is it when something happens
it is always you three?

593
00:53:36,394 --> 00:53:40,037
Believe me, professor, I've been asking
myself the same question for six years.

594
00:53:41,214 --> 00:53:42,440
Oh, Severus.

595
00:53:48,862 --> 00:53:49,937
What do you think?

596
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:56,660
I think Miss Bell is lucky to be alive.

597
00:53:57,447 --> 00:53:58,769
She was cursed, wasn't she?

598
00:53:59,857 --> 00:54:02,527
I know Katie. Off the pitch,
she wouldn't hurt a fly.

599
00:54:03,059 --> 00:54:06,649
If she was delivering that to Dumbledore,
she wasn't doing it knowingly.

600
00:54:06,734 --> 00:54:08,093
Yes, she was cursed.

601
00:54:09,465 --> 00:54:10,427
It was Malfoy.

602
00:54:13,007 --> 00:54:16,005
That is a very serious accusation, Potter.

603
00:54:17,023 --> 00:54:17,860
Indeed.

604
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:20,320
Your evidence?

605
00:54:21,256 --> 00:54:22,093
I just know.

606
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:24,847
You just...

607
00:54:26,687 --> 00:54:27,676
...know.

608
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:33,176
Once again,
you astonish with your gifts, Potter.

609
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:36,946
Gifts mere mortals
can only dream of possessing.

610
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:42,702
How grand it must be
to be the Chosen One.

611
00:54:48,263 --> 00:54:51,228
I suggest you go back to your dormitories.
All of you.

612
00:55:02,350 --> 00:55:04,296
What do you suppose
Dean sees in her? Ginny?

613
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:08,144
Well, what does she see in him?

614
00:55:09,015 --> 00:55:11,225
Dean? He's brilliant.

615
00:55:11,332 --> 00:55:13,602
You called him a slick git
not five hours ago.

616
00:55:14,458 --> 00:55:17,351
Yeah, well, he was running his hands
all over my sister, wasn't he?

617
00:55:18,323 --> 00:55:21,000
Something snaps,
and you've gotta hate him, you know?

618
00:55:21,752 --> 00:55:22,664
On principle.

619
00:55:23,597 --> 00:55:24,484
I suppose.

620
00:55:26,252 --> 00:55:28,665
- So, what is it he sees in her?
- I don't know.

621
00:55:30,228 --> 00:55:32,272
She's smart, funny.

622
00:55:33,327 --> 00:55:34,231
Attractive.

623
00:55:34,468 --> 00:55:35,353
Attractive?

624
00:55:37,278 --> 00:55:39,854
- You know, she's got nice skin.
- Skin?

625
00:55:41,592 --> 00:55:43,545
Dean dates my sister
because of her skin?

626
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:47,436
Well, no, I mean, I'm just saying
it could be a contributing factor.

627
00:55:51,497 --> 00:55:52,672
Hermione's got nice skin.

628
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:55,964
Wouldn't you say? As skin goes, I mean.

629
00:55:57,650 --> 00:55:59,033
I've never really thought about it.

630
00:56:01,178 --> 00:56:02,208
But, I suppose, yeah.

631
00:56:03,772 --> 00:56:04,617
Very nice.

632
00:56:09,327 --> 00:56:11,213
I think I'll be going to sleep now.

633
00:56:11,605 --> 00:56:12,493
Right. Yeah.

634
00:56:23,062 --> 00:56:26,553
So tell me, Cormac, do you see anything
of your Uncle Tiberius these days?

635
00:56:26,994 --> 00:56:29,682
Yes, sir. In fact,
I'm meant to go hunting with him...

636
00:56:29,767 --> 00:56:32,040
...and the Minister for Magic
over the holidays.

637
00:56:32,125 --> 00:56:34,770
Well, be sure to give them both my best.

638
00:56:35,205 --> 00:56:36,965
What about your uncle, Belby?

639
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:40,925
For those who don't know, Marcus'
uncle invented the Wolfsbane Potion.

640
00:56:41,010 --> 00:56:43,271
- Is he working on anything new?
- Don't know.

641
00:56:43,949 --> 00:56:45,291
Him and Dad don't get on.

642
00:56:45,376 --> 00:56:47,417
Probably because me dad
says potions are rubbish.

643
00:56:48,528 --> 00:56:51,304
Says the only potion worth having
is a stiff one at the end of the day.

644
00:56:51,389 --> 00:56:52,507
What about you, Miss Granger?

645
00:56:52,592 --> 00:56:55,912
What exactly does your family
do in the Muggle world?

646
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,160
My parents are dentists.

647
00:57:03,902 --> 00:57:05,259
They tend to people's teeth.

648
00:57:05,344 --> 00:57:06,755
Fascinating.

649
00:57:07,573 --> 00:57:10,145
And is that considered a
dangerous profession?

650
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:11,192
No.

651
00:57:13,584 --> 00:57:17,843
Although, one boy, Robbie Fenwick,
did bite my father once.

652
00:57:18,317 --> 00:57:19,732
He needed 10 stitches.

653
00:57:26,747 --> 00:57:28,798
Miss Weasley. Come in, come in.

654
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:35,853
Look at her eyes.
They've been fighting again, her and Dean.

655
00:57:36,618 --> 00:57:38,320
Sorry. I'm not usually late.

656
00:57:43,066 --> 00:57:44,081
No matter.

657
00:57:44,166 --> 00:57:47,534
You're just in time for dessert,
that is, if Belby's left you any.

658
00:57:55,629 --> 00:57:56,479
What?

659
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:57,688
Nothing.

660
00:58:04,736 --> 00:58:07,623
Goodbye. Bye-bye.

661
00:58:13,205 --> 00:58:14,423
- Potter.
- I'm sorry, sir.

662
00:58:14,508 --> 00:58:17,734
I was just admiring your hourglass.

663
00:58:19,053 --> 00:58:20,009
Oh, yes.

664
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,441
A most intriguing object.

665
00:58:23,782 --> 00:58:27,133
The sand runs in accordance
with the quality of the conversation.

666
00:58:28,178 --> 00:58:30,877
If it is stimulating,
the sand runs slowly.

667
00:58:32,129 --> 00:58:34,184
- If it is not...
- I think I'll be going.

668
00:58:34,269 --> 00:58:37,256
Nonsense.
You have nothing to fear, dear boy.

669
00:58:37,686 --> 00:58:39,593
As to some of your classmates...

670
00:58:39,993 --> 00:58:43,049
...well, let's just say they're unlikely
to make the shelf.

671
00:58:43,615 --> 00:58:44,508
The shelf, sir?

672
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,197
Anyone who aspires to be anyone
hopes to end up here.

673
00:58:49,582 --> 00:58:52,737
But then again, you already are someone,
aren't you, Harry?

674
00:58:55,010 --> 00:58:56,707
Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir?

675
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:00,950
You knew him, didn't you,
sir, Tom Riddle?

676
00:59:01,399 --> 00:59:02,340
You were his teacher.

677
00:59:04,125 --> 00:59:07,276
Mr. Riddle had a number of teachers
whilst here at Hogwarts.

678
00:59:07,795 --> 00:59:08,681
What was he like?

679
00:59:13,008 --> 00:59:14,740
I'm sorry, sir. Forgive me.

680
00:59:16,247 --> 00:59:17,357
He killed my parents.

681
00:59:20,693 --> 00:59:21,535
Of course.

682
00:59:22,398 --> 00:59:24,537
It's only natural
you should want to know more.

683
00:59:27,490 --> 00:59:29,514
But I'm afraid I must disappoint you,
Harry.

684
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:33,495
When I first met Mr. Riddle,
he was a quiet,

685
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:37,117
albeit brilliant, boy committed
to becoming a first-rate wizard.

686
00:59:38,023 --> 00:59:39,680
Not unlike others I've known.

687
00:59:40,394 --> 00:59:41,793
Not unlike yourself, in fact.

688
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:45,326
If the monster existed...

689
00:59:46,348 --> 00:59:47,913
...it was buried deep within.

690
01:00:06,073 --> 01:00:06,915
Good luck, eh, Ron.

691
01:00:08,944 --> 01:00:11,404
<i>- Nice hat!
- Ron, you're a loser.</i>

692
01:00:11,489 --> 01:00:14,520
I'm counting on you, Ron.
I have two Galleons on Gryffindor, yeah?

693
01:00:14,605 --> 01:00:16,935
<i>- Looking good, Ron.
- Loser!</i>

694
01:00:18,938 --> 01:00:19,921
<i>What's he wearing?</i>

695
01:00:29,593 --> 01:00:30,548
So how was it, then?

696
01:00:32,568 --> 01:00:34,466
- How was what?
- Your dinner party?

697
01:00:35,068 --> 01:00:36,212
Pretty boring, actually.

698
01:00:37,534 --> 01:00:38,953
Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert.

699
01:00:43,332 --> 01:00:45,100
Slughorn's having a Christmas do,
you know.

700
01:00:46,167 --> 01:00:47,459
And we're meant to bring someone.

701
01:00:47,544 --> 01:00:50,693
I expect you'll be bringing McLaggen.
He's in the Slug Club, isn't he?

702
01:00:51,757 --> 01:00:54,209
- Actually, I was going to ask you.
- Really?

703
01:00:57,442 --> 01:00:58,695
Good luck today, Ron.

704
01:01:00,256 --> 01:01:01,802
I know you'll be brilliant.

705
01:01:05,646 --> 01:01:06,581
I'm resigning.

706
01:01:06,947 --> 01:01:09,439
After today's match,
McLaggen can have my spot.

707
01:01:09,524 --> 01:01:10,426
Have it your way.

708
01:01:11,082 --> 01:01:13,013
- Juice?
- Sure.

709
01:01:13,896 --> 01:01:14,793
Hello, everyone.

710
01:01:16,895 --> 01:01:18,178
You look dreadful, Ron.

711
01:01:19,068 --> 01:01:20,752
Is that why you put something
in his cup?

712
01:01:23,706 --> 01:01:24,623
Is it a tonic?

713
01:01:28,827 --> 01:01:29,729
Liquid luck.

714
01:01:31,795 --> 01:01:32,953
Don't drink it, Ron.

715
01:01:41,055 --> 01:01:43,426
- You could be expelled for that.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

716
01:01:46,635 --> 01:01:48,520
Come on, Harry.
We've got a game to win.

717
01:02:15,413 --> 01:02:18,253
Go on, Ron! Do it!

718
01:02:52,202 --> 01:02:54,425
<i>Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!</i>

719
01:02:56,383 --> 01:02:59,833
<i>Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!</i>

720
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:15,301
<i>Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!</i>

721
01:03:19,466 --> 01:03:20,610
You really shouldn't have done it.

722
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:22,276
I know.

723
01:03:23,018 --> 01:03:25,565
I suppose I could've just
used a Confundus Charm.

724
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:28,549
That was different.

725
01:03:29,257 --> 01:03:31,252
That was tryouts. This was an actual game.

726
01:03:34,870 --> 01:03:35,770
You didn't put it in.

727
01:03:38,290 --> 01:03:39,471
Ron only thought you did.

728
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:30,357
Charms spell. I'm just practicing.

729
01:04:35,129 --> 01:04:36,189
Well, they're really good.

730
01:04:42,477 --> 01:04:43,858
How does it feel, Harry?

731
01:04:47,317 --> 01:04:49,300
When you see Dean with Ginny?

732
01:04:55,617 --> 01:04:56,461
I know.

733
01:04:58,157 --> 01:04:59,554
I see the way you look at her.

734
01:05:00,956 --> 01:05:01,951
You're my best friend.

735
01:05:15,006 --> 01:05:16,583
I think this room's taken.

736
01:05:19,115 --> 01:05:20,168
What's with the birds?

737
01:05:23,806 --> 01:05:24,685
<i>Oppugno.</i>

738
01:05:53,544 --> 01:05:54,551
It feels like this.

739
01:06:34,953 --> 01:06:37,173
Look, I can't help it
if she's got her knickers in a twist.

740
01:06:38,172 --> 01:06:39,910
What Lav and I have,

741
01:06:39,995 --> 01:06:43,039
well, let's just say,
there's no stopping it.

742
01:06:43,548 --> 01:06:44,428
It's chemical.

743
01:06:45,012 --> 01:06:46,973
Will it last? Who knows?

744
01:06:47,576 --> 01:06:48,758
Point is, I'm a free agent.

745
01:06:49,512 --> 01:06:52,123
He's at perfect liberty
to kiss whoever he likes.

746
01:06:52,512 --> 01:06:54,041
I really couldn't care less.

747
01:06:55,102 --> 01:06:56,497
Was I under the impression he and I...

748
01:06:56,582 --> 01:06:58,692
...would be attending Slughorn's
Christmas party together?

749
01:06:59,102 --> 01:06:59,942
Yes.

750
01:07:00,715 --> 01:07:04,537
Now, given the circumstances,
I've had to make other arrangements.

751
01:07:05,479 --> 01:07:06,315
Have you?

752
01:07:06,797 --> 01:07:08,226
Yes. Why?

753
01:07:09,006 --> 01:07:12,345
I just thought, seeing as neither of us
can go with who we'd really like to...

754
01:07:12,430 --> 01:07:14,350
...we should go together, as friends.

755
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:16,463
Why didn't I think of that?

756
01:07:16,910 --> 01:07:17,835
Who are you going with?

757
01:07:19,075 --> 01:07:20,153
It's a surprise.

758
01:07:20,517 --> 01:07:22,325
Anyway, it's you we've
got to worry about.

759
01:07:22,410 --> 01:07:23,722
You can't just take anyone.

760
01:07:25,356 --> 01:07:26,539
See that girl over there?

761
01:07:28,930 --> 01:07:30,183
That's Romilda Vane.

762
01:07:31,244 --> 01:07:33,227
Apparently she's trying
to smuggle you a love potion.

763
01:07:33,810 --> 01:07:34,646
Really?

764
01:07:36,270 --> 01:07:39,578
Hey! She's only interested in you
because she thinks you're the Chosen One.

765
01:07:39,663 --> 01:07:41,071
But I am the Chosen One.

766
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:44,640
Okay, sorry. Kidding.

767
01:07:46,689 --> 01:07:47,785
I'll ask someone I like.

768
01:07:48,882 --> 01:07:49,723
Someone cool.

769
01:08:00,326 --> 01:08:02,428
I've never been
to this part of the castle.

770
01:08:03,323 --> 01:08:06,228
At least not while awake.
I sleepwalk, you see.

771
01:08:06,737 --> 01:08:08,336
That's why I wear shoes to bed.

772
01:08:40,537 --> 01:08:42,478
<i>Harmonia Nectere Passus.</i>

773
01:08:56,162 --> 01:08:58,173
<i>Harmonia Nectere Passus.</i>

774
01:09:00,346 --> 01:09:02,200
<i>Harmonia Nectere Passus.</i>

775
01:09:17,656 --> 01:09:18,507
Drink?

776
01:09:19,986 --> 01:09:20,875
Neville.

777
01:09:21,496 --> 01:09:22,709
I didn't get into the Slug Club.

778
01:09:23,255 --> 01:09:24,332
It's okay, though.

779
01:09:24,417 --> 01:09:26,154
He's got Belby handing
out towels in the loo.

780
01:09:26,239 --> 01:09:28,201
- Oh, well, I'm fine, mate. Thanks.
- Okay.

781
01:09:39,612 --> 01:09:42,495
Hermione. What are you doing?
And what happened to you?

782
01:09:42,717 --> 01:09:44,079
No, I've just escaped.

783
01:09:44,648 --> 01:09:48,088
I mean, left Cormac under the mistletoe.

784
01:09:48,173 --> 01:09:50,487
Cormac? That's who you invited?

785
01:09:51,689 --> 01:09:53,193
I thought it would annoy Ron the most.

786
01:09:54,869 --> 01:09:56,718
Thank you. I'll catch up with you later.

787
01:09:56,803 --> 01:09:59,114
He's got more tentacles
than a Snarfalump plant.

788
01:10:00,153 --> 01:10:02,150
- Dragon tartare?
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.

789
01:10:02,444 --> 01:10:05,058
Just as well.
They give one horribly bad breath.

790
01:10:05,143 --> 01:10:06,366
On second thoughts...

791
01:10:07,284 --> 01:10:08,684
Might keep Cormac at bay.

792
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:11,414
Oh, God, here he comes.

793
01:10:15,270 --> 01:10:17,553
I think she just went to powder her nose.

794
01:10:18,053 --> 01:10:19,810
Slippery little minx, your friend.

795
01:10:20,383 --> 01:10:22,203
Likes to work her mouth too,
doesn't she?

796
01:10:26,109 --> 01:10:27,168
What is this I'm eating, by the way?

797
01:10:29,303 --> 01:10:30,248
Dragon balls.

798
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:45,367
You've just bought yourself
a month's detention, McLaggen.

799
01:10:45,452 --> 01:10:48,613
Not so quick, Potter.

800
01:10:50,808 --> 01:10:53,148
Sir, I really think I
should rejoin the party.

801
01:10:53,233 --> 01:10:54,077
My date...

802
01:10:54,162 --> 01:10:58,167
Can surely survive your absence
for another minute or two.

803
01:10:58,252 --> 01:11:00,491
Besides, I only wish
to convey a message.

804
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:03,466
- A message?
- From Professor Dumbledore.

805
01:11:03,550 --> 01:11:07,296
He asked me to give you his best,
and he hopes you enjoy your holiday.

806
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:08,228
You see...

807
01:11:09,035 --> 01:11:14,548
...he's traveling, and he won't
return until term resumes.

808
01:11:14,747 --> 01:11:15,619
Traveling where?

809
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,360
Take your hands off me, you filthy Squib!

810
01:11:27,490 --> 01:11:29,005
Professor Slughorn, sir.

811
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:33,308
I just discovered this boy
lurking in an upstairs corridor.

812
01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:35,995
He claims to have been
invited to your party.

813
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:39,001
Okay, okay. I was gatecrashing. Happy?

814
01:11:39,512 --> 01:11:42,740
I'll escort him out.

815
01:11:46,142 --> 01:11:48,871
Certainly, professor.

816
01:11:53,434 --> 01:11:56,105
All right, everyone, carry on, carry on.

817
01:11:58,859 --> 01:12:00,501
Maybe I did hex that Bell girl.

818
01:12:00,586 --> 01:12:02,903
Maybe I didn't. What's it to you?

819
01:12:03,853 --> 01:12:05,410
I swore to protect you.

820
01:12:06,199 --> 01:12:08,828
I made the Unbreakable Vow.

821
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:11,454
I don't need protection.

822
01:12:11,982 --> 01:12:15,164
I was chosen for this.
Out of all others. Me.

823
01:12:17,032 --> 01:12:19,688
- And I won't fail him.
- You're afraid, Draco.

824
01:12:21,258 --> 01:12:23,409
You attempt to conceal it,
but it's obvious.

825
01:12:23,494 --> 01:12:25,214
Let me assist you.

826
01:12:25,299 --> 01:12:26,181
No!

827
01:12:27,050 --> 01:12:29,834
I was chosen. This is my moment.

828
01:12:42,987 --> 01:12:44,193
"Unbreakable Vow."

829
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,224
You're sure that's what Snape said?

830
01:12:46,537 --> 01:12:48,386
Positive. Why?

831
01:12:48,878 --> 01:12:51,643
Well, it's just you can't break
an Unbreakable Vow.

832
01:12:52,635 --> 01:12:55,241
I'd worked that much out for myself,
funnily enough.

833
01:12:56,507 --> 01:12:57,486
You don't understand.

834
01:12:58,877 --> 01:12:59,906
Oh, bloody hell.

835
01:13:27,735 --> 01:13:29,151
I miss you.

836
01:13:31,367 --> 01:13:32,200
Lovely.

837
01:13:33,093 --> 01:13:34,610
All she wants to do is snog me.

838
01:13:35,362 --> 01:13:36,457
My lips are getting chapped. Look.

839
01:13:36,542 --> 01:13:37,857
I'll take your word for it.

840
01:13:48,835 --> 01:13:49,924
So, what happens to you?

841
01:13:50,919 --> 01:13:52,851
What happens if you break
an Unbreakable Vow?

842
01:13:54,597 --> 01:13:55,587
You die.

843
01:14:00,223 --> 01:14:01,702
<i>Wait, the pudding's still here.</i>

844
01:14:03,814 --> 01:14:07,154
Voldemort has chosen
Draco Malfoy for a mission?

845
01:14:07,239 --> 01:14:08,165
I know it sounds mad.

846
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:12,158
Has it occurred to you Snape
was simply pretending to offer Draco help,

847
01:14:12,243 --> 01:14:13,782
so he could find out
what he was up to?

848
01:14:14,913 --> 01:14:15,879
That's not what it sounded like.

849
01:14:15,964 --> 01:14:17,642
Perhaps Harry's right, Reymus.

850
01:14:18,356 --> 01:14:19,761
To make an Unbreakable Vow, it's...

851
01:14:19,846 --> 01:14:23,788
It comes down to whether or not
you trust Dumbledore's judgment.

852
01:14:23,873 --> 01:14:26,572
Dumbledore trusts Snape, therefore I do.

853
01:14:26,657 --> 01:14:28,037
Dumbledore can make mistakes.

854
01:14:28,122 --> 01:14:29,282
You're blinded by hatred.

855
01:14:29,367 --> 01:14:30,776
- I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

856
01:14:33,303 --> 01:14:35,973
People are disappearing, Harry, daily.

857
01:14:36,375 --> 01:14:38,335
We can only place our trust
in a handful of people.

858
01:14:38,429 --> 01:14:41,095
If we start fighting amongst ourselves,
we're doomed.

859
01:14:45,170 --> 01:14:46,097
<i>Ginny!</i>

860
01:15:05,937 --> 01:15:06,822
Open up, you.

861
01:15:09,124 --> 01:15:10,107
Don't you trust me?

862
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:17,922
It's good.

863
01:15:19,076 --> 01:15:21,049
Yeah, I'll just... Get... Yeah.

864
01:15:28,730 --> 01:15:30,719
- Pie?
- Not for me, no.

865
01:15:43,362 --> 01:15:44,912
You'll have to forgive Remus.

866
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:47,126
It takes its toll, his condition.

867
01:15:48,927 --> 01:15:50,185
Are you all right, Mr. Weasley?

868
01:15:51,097 --> 01:15:52,961
We're being followed, all of us.

869
01:15:53,919 --> 01:15:55,876
Most days,
Molly doesn't leave the house.

870
01:15:57,139 --> 01:15:58,486
It's not been easy.

871
01:16:01,269 --> 01:16:02,241
Did you get my owl?

872
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:03,907
Yes, I did.

873
01:16:06,447 --> 01:16:09,068
If Dumbledore's traveling,
then that's news to the Ministry...

874
01:16:09,153 --> 01:16:11,387
...but perhaps that's the way
Dumbledore wants it.

875
01:16:12,898 --> 01:16:14,412
As for Draco Malfoy...

876
01:16:15,948 --> 01:16:16,978
...I know a bit more.

877
01:16:17,754 --> 01:16:20,794
- Go on.
- I sent an agent to Borgin and Burkes.

878
01:16:20,948 --> 01:16:22,693
I think, from what you described...

879
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:25,283
...what you and Ron saw in summer...

880
01:16:25,368 --> 01:16:28,244
...the object
that the Draco is so interested in...

881
01:16:28,966 --> 01:16:30,099
...is a vanishing cabinet.

882
01:16:31,362 --> 01:16:32,362
A vanishing cabinet?

883
01:16:32,838 --> 01:16:36,002
They were all the rage
when Voldemort first rose to power.

884
01:16:36,864 --> 01:16:37,977
You can see the appeal.

885
01:16:38,265 --> 01:16:39,898
Should Death Eaters come knocking...

886
01:16:39,983 --> 01:16:44,040
...one simply had to slip inside
and disappear for an hour or two.

887
01:16:45,398 --> 01:16:47,138
They can transport you anywhere.

888
01:16:47,350 --> 01:16:50,159
Tricky contraptions though,
very temperamental.

889
01:16:50,905 --> 01:16:53,825
What happened to it?
The one at Borgin and Burkes?

890
01:16:54,019 --> 01:16:54,872
Nothing.

891
01:16:55,995 --> 01:16:56,866
It's still there.

892
01:17:08,866 --> 01:17:10,190
It was delicious, Molly, really.

893
01:17:10,275 --> 01:17:11,611
Are you sure you won't stay?

894
01:17:12,110 --> 01:17:13,025
No, we should go.

895
01:17:13,936 --> 01:17:16,044
The first night of the cycle's
always the worst.

896
01:17:16,836 --> 01:17:17,722
Remus?

897
01:17:26,614 --> 01:17:27,578
Sweetheart.

898
01:17:36,532 --> 01:17:37,554
Has Ron gone to bed?

899
01:17:39,185 --> 01:17:40,519
Not yet. No.

900
01:17:43,027 --> 01:17:43,865
Shoelace.

901
01:17:56,980 --> 01:17:57,986
Merry Christmas, Harry.

902
01:18:00,262 --> 01:18:01,159
Merry Christmas.

903
01:18:19,183 --> 01:18:21,473
- Harry, no!
- Remus!

904
01:18:31,323 --> 01:18:32,301
Ginny!

905
01:18:35,912 --> 01:18:40,474
<i>I killed Sirius Black!
I killed Sirius Black!</i>

906
01:18:40,752 --> 01:18:42,339
You coming to get me?

907
01:18:44,074 --> 01:18:46,560
Harry, can you get me?
You coming to get me?

908
01:19:16,970 --> 01:19:17,865
Harry?

909
01:19:36,050 --> 01:19:37,026
<i>Stupefy!</i>

910
01:20:00,579 --> 01:20:01,971
<i>Harry!</i>

911
01:20:15,933 --> 01:20:16,821
<i>Ginny!</i>

912
01:20:46,617 --> 01:20:47,527
Molly.

913
01:21:10,974 --> 01:21:12,567
It's easy for them to get to you.

914
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:14,479
You're bloody lucky you weren't killed.

915
01:21:15,810 --> 01:21:17,191
You have to realize who you are, Harry.

916
01:21:17,276 --> 01:21:18,933
I know who I am, Hermione, all right?

917
01:21:20,776 --> 01:21:21,618
Sorry.

918
01:21:23,656 --> 01:21:25,981
Lav, come on. Of course I'll wear it.

919
01:21:27,050 --> 01:21:28,322
That's my Won-Won.

920
01:21:31,150 --> 01:21:32,723
Excuse me, I have to go and vomit.

921
01:21:53,994 --> 01:21:56,182
<i>More knowledgeable
than half the staff, you are.</i>

922
01:22:02,524 --> 01:22:03,402
Sir...

923
01:22:04,468 --> 01:22:07,211
...is it true
that Professor Merrythought is retiring?

924
01:22:07,534 --> 01:22:10,039
Now, Tom.
I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I?

925
01:22:10,494 --> 01:22:13,857
By the way, thank you for the pineapple.
You're quite right, it is my favorite.

926
01:22:15,333 --> 01:22:16,843
But how did you know?

927
01:22:19,333 --> 01:22:20,285
Intuition.

928
01:22:25,163 --> 01:22:26,951
Gracious. Is it that time already?

929
01:22:27,036 --> 01:22:29,849
Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippet
will have us all in detention.

930
01:22:34,787 --> 01:22:35,744
Look sharp, Tom.

931
01:22:36,696 --> 01:22:38,700
Don't want to be caught
out of bed after hours.

932
01:22:40,592 --> 01:22:42,928
- Is something on your mind, Tom?
- Yes, sir.

933
01:22:43,987 --> 01:22:46,073
You see, I couldn't think
of anyone else to go to.

934
01:22:47,772 --> 01:22:51,979
The other professors,
well, they're not like you.

935
01:22:53,152 --> 01:22:55,409
They might misunderstand.

936
01:22:56,290 --> 01:22:57,123
Go on.

937
01:22:58,742 --> 01:23:00,202
I was in the library the other night...

938
01:23:01,570 --> 01:23:03,023
...in the Restricted Section...

939
01:23:04,530 --> 01:23:07,735
...and I read something rather odd
about a bit of rare magic.

940
01:23:08,905 --> 01:23:11,471
And I thought perhaps
you could illuminate me.

941
01:23:12,583 --> 01:23:14,668
It's called, as I understand it...

942
01:23:18,325 --> 01:23:19,400
I beg your pardon?

943
01:23:19,806 --> 01:23:23,386
I don't know anything about such things,
and if I did, I wouldn't tell you!

944
01:23:23,470 --> 01:23:24,887
Now, get out of here at once,

945
01:23:24,972 --> 01:23:27,347
and don't let me ever catch
you mentioning it again!

946
01:23:31,230 --> 01:23:32,072
Confused?

947
01:23:33,060 --> 01:23:34,446
I'd be surprised if you weren't.

948
01:23:35,377 --> 01:23:38,127
Well, I don't understand.
What happened?

949
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:41,383
This is perhaps the most important
memory I've collected.

950
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:43,983
It is also a lie.

951
01:23:45,014 --> 01:23:46,945
This memory has been tampered with...

952
01:23:47,030 --> 01:23:49,164
...by the same person whose memory it is,

953
01:23:49,249 --> 01:23:51,160
our old friend, Professor Slughorn.

954
01:23:52,078 --> 01:23:54,018
But why would he tamper
with his own memory?

955
01:23:54,103 --> 01:23:56,443
- I suspect he's ashamed of it.
- Why?

956
01:23:57,272 --> 01:23:58,279
Why, indeed?

957
01:23:59,524 --> 01:24:02,951
I asked you to get to know
Professor Slughorn, and you have done so.

958
01:24:03,036 --> 01:24:06,708
Now I want you to persuade him
to divulge his true memory...

959
01:24:06,793 --> 01:24:08,022
...any way you can.

960
01:24:08,599 --> 01:24:10,302
I don't know him that well, sir.

961
01:24:15,018 --> 01:24:16,741
This memory is everything.

962
01:24:18,374 --> 01:24:19,716
Without it, we are blind.

963
01:24:20,938 --> 01:24:23,764
Without it, we leave the fate
of our world to chance.

964
01:24:26,618 --> 01:24:27,672
You have no choice.

965
01:24:29,658 --> 01:24:30,870
You must not fail.

966
01:24:39,747 --> 01:24:41,954
So I'd highly recommend
you reacquaint yourself...

967
01:24:42,039 --> 01:24:43,657
...with the chapter on antidotes.

968
01:24:43,742 --> 01:24:46,193
I'll tell you more about
bezoars in our next class.

969
01:24:46,278 --> 01:24:47,211
Right, off you go.

970
01:24:47,797 --> 01:24:49,445
Alys, don't forget your rat tail.

971
01:24:55,767 --> 01:24:59,247
Aha. If it isn't
the Prince of Potions himself.

972
01:24:59,727 --> 01:25:01,325
To what do I owe this pleasure?

973
01:25:03,022 --> 01:25:04,981
Sir, I wondered
if I might ask you something.

974
01:25:05,066 --> 01:25:07,166
Ask away, dear boy, ask away.

975
01:25:07,983 --> 01:25:10,473
The other day I was in the library,
in the Restricted Section...

976
01:25:10,558 --> 01:25:14,134
...and I came across something rather odd
about a very rare piece of magic.

977
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:18,347
Yes. And what was this
rare piece of magic?

978
01:25:18,432 --> 01:25:21,434
Well, I don't know.
I can't remember the name exactly.

979
01:25:21,952 --> 01:25:22,809
It got me wondering,

980
01:25:22,894 --> 01:25:25,781
are there some kinds of magic
you're not allowed to teach us?

981
01:25:28,302 --> 01:25:29,634
I'm Potions Master, Harry.

982
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:32,711
I think your question'd
better be posed to Professor Snape.

983
01:25:32,845 --> 01:25:33,697
Yes.

984
01:25:34,860 --> 01:25:37,144
He and I don't exactly
see eye to eye, sir.

985
01:25:37,490 --> 01:25:38,716
What I mean to say is...

986
01:25:40,105 --> 01:25:41,107
...well, he's not like you.

987
01:25:42,565 --> 01:25:43,687
He might misunderstand.

988
01:25:45,815 --> 01:25:46,670
Yes.

989
01:25:47,213 --> 01:25:49,079
There can be no light without the dark.

990
01:25:49,687 --> 01:25:50,739
And so it is with magic.

991
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:53,091
Myself, I always strive
to live within the light.

992
01:25:54,428 --> 01:25:55,716
I suggest you do the same.

993
01:25:56,534 --> 01:25:59,311
Is that what you told Tom Riddle, sir
when he came asking questions?

994
01:26:06,504 --> 01:26:08,800
Dumbledore put you up to this,
didn't he?

995
01:26:11,544 --> 01:26:12,395
Didn't he?

996
01:26:20,553 --> 01:26:21,390
Yes?

997
01:26:22,274 --> 01:26:23,789
Oh, it's you, Potter.

998
01:26:24,364 --> 01:26:26,255
I'm sorry, I'm busy at the moment.

999
01:26:39,598 --> 01:26:42,727
It's beautiful, isn't it? The moon.

1000
01:26:44,380 --> 01:26:45,227
Divine.

1001
01:26:46,518 --> 01:26:48,581
Had ourselves a little
late-night snack, did we?

1002
01:26:49,819 --> 01:26:53,070
It was on your bed, the box.
I just thought I'd try one.

1003
01:26:53,752 --> 01:26:54,627
Or 20.

1004
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:57,087
I can't stop thinking about her, Harry.

1005
01:26:57,172 --> 01:26:59,355
Honestly, I reckoned
she was starting to annoy you.

1006
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:01,058
She could never annoy me.

1007
01:27:03,522 --> 01:27:04,656
I think I love her.

1008
01:27:08,850 --> 01:27:10,457
Well, brilliant.

1009
01:27:15,012 --> 01:27:16,449
Do you think she knows I exist?

1010
01:27:16,550 --> 01:27:19,247
Very well, I hope so.
She's been snogging you for three months.

1011
01:27:19,543 --> 01:27:20,410
Snogging?

1012
01:27:21,123 --> 01:27:22,383
Who are you talking about?

1013
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:24,356
Who are you talking about?

1014
01:27:25,298 --> 01:27:26,516
Romilda, of course.

1015
01:27:27,420 --> 01:27:28,459
Romilda Vane.

1016
01:27:28,738 --> 01:27:30,238
Okay, very funny.

1017
01:27:33,733 --> 01:27:35,003
What was that for?

1018
01:27:35,088 --> 01:27:37,505
It's no joke! I'm in love with her!

1019
01:27:37,590 --> 01:27:40,106
All right, fine, you're in love with her.
Have you ever actually met her?

1020
01:27:41,365 --> 01:27:44,225
No. Can you introduce me?

1021
01:28:06,116 --> 01:28:06,955
Come on, Ron.

1022
01:28:07,900 --> 01:28:09,905
I'm gonna introduce you to Romilda Vane.

1023
01:28:21,588 --> 01:28:24,581
I'm sorry, sir. I wouldn't bother you
if it weren't absolutely essential.

1024
01:28:26,098 --> 01:28:27,200
Where's Romilda?

1025
01:28:27,660 --> 01:28:28,806
What's the matter with Wenby?

1026
01:28:30,010 --> 01:28:31,530
Very powerful love potion.

1027
01:28:32,058 --> 01:28:33,989
Very well. Better bring him in.

1028
01:28:34,823 --> 01:28:37,867
I'd have thought you could whip up
a remedy for this in no time, Harry.

1029
01:28:37,952 --> 01:28:40,642
Well, I thought this called
for a more practiced hand, sir.

1030
01:28:41,277 --> 01:28:44,002
Hello, darling. Fancy a drink?

1031
01:28:44,439 --> 01:28:45,389
Perhaps you're right.

1032
01:28:50,514 --> 01:28:55,825
I'm sorry, by the way, professor,
about earlier today, our misunderstanding.

1033
01:28:56,287 --> 01:28:57,127
Oh, not at all.

1034
01:28:57,212 --> 01:28:59,897
All water under the bridge, you know?
Correct?

1035
01:29:00,795 --> 01:29:03,126
I expect you're tired of it
after all these years.

1036
01:29:03,916 --> 01:29:06,068
All the questions about Voldemort.

1037
01:29:06,636 --> 01:29:07,733
Don't use that name.

1038
01:29:16,226 --> 01:29:17,676
There you are, old boy. Bottoms up.

1039
01:29:18,468 --> 01:29:19,316
What's this?

1040
01:29:19,697 --> 01:29:20,886
Tonic for the nerves.

1041
01:29:36,019 --> 01:29:37,131
What happened to me?

1042
01:29:37,216 --> 01:29:38,079
Love potion.

1043
01:29:38,503 --> 01:29:40,067
A bloody strong one at that.

1044
01:29:41,295 --> 01:29:42,637
I feel really bad.

1045
01:29:42,722 --> 01:29:44,288
You need a pick-me-up.

1046
01:29:44,696 --> 01:29:48,839
Got Butterbeer,
wine, dazzling oak-matured mead.

1047
01:29:48,924 --> 01:29:52,313
I had other intentions for this,
but I think, given the circumstances...

1048
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:56,549
Here we are, Potter.

1049
01:29:57,434 --> 01:29:58,325
To life!

1050
01:30:03,605 --> 01:30:04,443
Ron.

1051
01:30:07,234 --> 01:30:10,093
Ron. Professor, do something.

1052
01:30:11,734 --> 01:30:13,363
I don't understand.

1053
01:30:29,793 --> 01:30:31,230
Come on, Ron, breathe.

1054
01:30:53,822 --> 01:30:55,946
These girls, they're gonna kill me.

1055
01:31:07,630 --> 01:31:10,173
Quick thinking on your part, Harry,
using a bezoar.

1056
01:31:11,210 --> 01:31:12,976
You must be very proud
of your student, Horace.

1057
01:31:15,029 --> 01:31:16,615
Oh, yes, very proud.

1058
01:31:17,245 --> 01:31:20,104
I think we agree,
Potter's actions were heroic.

1059
01:31:20,189 --> 01:31:23,895
The question is, why were they necessary?

1060
01:31:24,430 --> 01:31:25,328
Why, indeed?

1061
01:31:26,437 --> 01:31:28,427
This appears to be a gift, Horace.

1062
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:30,620
You don't remember
who gave you this bottle?

1063
01:31:31,657 --> 01:31:35,208
Which, by the way, possesses remarkably
subtle hints of licorice and cherry...

1064
01:31:35,733 --> 01:31:37,445
...when not polluted with poison.

1065
01:31:38,376 --> 01:31:41,319
Actually I had intended
to give it as a gift myself.

1066
01:31:41,597 --> 01:31:42,807
To whom, I might ask?

1067
01:31:44,909 --> 01:31:46,357
To you, Headmaster.

1068
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:50,481
Where is he?

1069
01:31:50,636 --> 01:31:54,067
Where's my Won-Won?
Has he been asking for me?

1070
01:31:57,879 --> 01:31:59,084
What's she doing here?

1071
01:31:59,528 --> 01:32:01,429
I might ask you the same question.

1072
01:32:02,129 --> 01:32:04,379
I happen to be his girlfriend.

1073
01:32:04,464 --> 01:32:06,935
I happen to be his friend.

1074
01:32:07,420 --> 01:32:10,988
Don't make me laugh.
You haven't spoken in weeks.

1075
01:32:12,438 --> 01:32:15,528
I suppose you want to make up with him
now that he's suddenly all interesting.

1076
01:32:15,613 --> 01:32:18,412
He's been poisoned, you daft dimbo!

1077
01:32:19,398 --> 01:32:21,480
And for the record,
I've always found him interesting.

1078
01:32:23,908 --> 01:32:28,168
Ah. See? He senses my presence.

1079
01:32:29,165 --> 01:32:32,115
Don't worry, Won-Won. I'm here.

1080
01:32:33,078 --> 01:32:34,106
I'm here.

1081
01:32:41,654 --> 01:32:43,093
Hermione...

1082
01:32:47,895 --> 01:32:49,111
Hermione.

1083
01:32:51,030 --> 01:32:52,206
Hermione.

1084
01:33:00,526 --> 01:33:03,927
Oh, to be young,
and to feel love's keen sting.

1085
01:33:04,856 --> 01:33:06,573
Well, come away, everybody.

1086
01:33:07,278 --> 01:33:09,053
Mr. Weasley is well tended.

1087
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:15,950
About time, don't you think?

1088
01:33:19,503 --> 01:33:20,339
Thank you.

1089
01:33:24,059 --> 01:33:24,905
Oh, shut up.

1090
01:35:38,187 --> 01:35:41,062
Stop it, Ron. You're making it snow.

1091
01:35:46,350 --> 01:35:48,351
Tell me how I broke up
with Lavender again.

1092
01:35:50,876 --> 01:35:51,713
Well...

1093
01:35:52,859 --> 01:35:54,889
...she came to visit you in the hospital.

1094
01:35:56,729 --> 01:35:58,310
And you talked.

1095
01:36:00,659 --> 01:36:03,865
I don't believe it was
a particularly long conversation.

1096
01:36:04,886 --> 01:36:07,890
Don't get me wrong, I'm bloody thrilled
to be shot of her.

1097
01:36:08,425 --> 01:36:09,983
It's just she seems a bit put out.

1098
01:36:17,203 --> 01:36:19,879
Yes, she does, doesn't she?

1099
01:36:22,349 --> 01:36:26,750
You say you don't remember
anything from that night?

1100
01:36:27,606 --> 01:36:29,722
Anything at all?

1101
01:36:30,744 --> 01:36:32,032
There is something.

1102
01:36:36,107 --> 01:36:40,109
But it can't be.
I was completely boggled, wasn't I?

1103
01:36:42,067 --> 01:36:44,622
Right. Boggled.

1104
01:36:52,577 --> 01:36:53,496
Harry.

1105
01:36:55,350 --> 01:36:56,520
That's Katie.

1106
01:36:58,417 --> 01:36:59,272
Katie Bell.

1107
01:37:07,652 --> 01:37:09,859
Katie. How are you?

1108
01:37:10,766 --> 01:37:12,505
I know you're going to ask, Harry,

1109
01:37:13,359 --> 01:37:15,060
but I don't know who cursed me.

1110
01:37:16,896 --> 01:37:19,574
I've been trying to remember, honestly.

1111
01:37:20,963 --> 01:37:23,646
But I just can't.

1112
01:37:37,566 --> 01:37:38,434
Katie?

1113
01:38:21,380 --> 01:38:24,747
<i>I know what you did, Malfoy.
You hexed her, didn't you?</i>

1114
01:38:55,868 --> 01:38:57,054
<i>Sectumsempra!</i>

1115
01:39:44,740 --> 01:39:47,016
<i>Vulnera Sanentur.</i>

1116
01:39:49,265 --> 01:39:51,450
<i>Vulnera Sanentur.</i>

1117
01:39:54,459 --> 01:39:56,806
<i>Vulnera Sanentur.</i>

1118
01:40:18,438 --> 01:40:21,134
You have to get rid of it. Today.

1119
01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:27,803
Take my hand.

1120
01:40:44,467 --> 01:40:45,657
The Room of Requirement.

1121
01:40:52,815 --> 01:40:54,852
We need to hide
the Half-Blood Prince's book...

1122
01:40:55,567 --> 01:40:58,524
...where no one will ever find it,
including you.

1123
01:41:07,629 --> 01:41:08,638
- What was that?
- What was that?

1124
01:41:35,193 --> 01:41:36,121
See?

1125
01:41:37,145 --> 01:41:38,630
You never know what you'll find up here.

1126
01:41:58,286 --> 01:42:01,881
All right, close your eyes.
That way you can't be tempted.

1127
01:42:06,084 --> 01:42:07,219
Close your eyes.

1128
01:42:34,445 --> 01:42:36,486
That can stay hidden up here too,
if you like.

1129
01:42:52,002 --> 01:42:53,614
So did you and Ginny do it, then?

1130
01:42:54,512 --> 01:42:55,383
What?

1131
01:42:55,996 --> 01:42:57,311
You know, hide the book?

1132
01:42:58,062 --> 01:42:59,577
Oh, yeah.

1133
01:43:02,946 --> 01:43:05,195
Ah. Dear, yes.

1134
01:43:05,625 --> 01:43:07,648
Still no luck with Slughorn, then,
I take it?

1135
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:11,361
Luck.

1136
01:43:12,765 --> 01:43:15,455
That's it. All I need's a bit of luck.

1137
01:43:34,380 --> 01:43:36,724
Well, how do you feel?

1138
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:38,674
Excellent.

1139
01:43:40,550 --> 01:43:41,662
Really excellent.

1140
01:43:45,246 --> 01:43:46,197
Remember...

1141
01:43:47,174 --> 01:43:49,054
...Slughorn usually eats early,

1142
01:43:49,139 --> 01:43:52,263
takes a walk,
and then returns to his office.

1143
01:43:52,348 --> 01:43:53,211
Right.

1144
01:43:54,229 --> 01:43:55,776
- I'm going down to Hagrid's.
- What?

1145
01:43:56,417 --> 01:43:59,087
No, Harry, you've got to go
and speak to Slughorn.

1146
01:44:00,778 --> 01:44:01,760
We have a plan.

1147
01:44:01,845 --> 01:44:03,042
I know but...

1148
01:44:03,127 --> 01:44:05,627
...but I've got a
good feeling about Hagrid's.

1149
01:44:05,712 --> 01:44:09,249
I feel it's the place to be tonight.
Do you know what I mean?

1150
01:44:10,410 --> 01:44:12,597
- No.
- Well, trust me, I know what I'm doing.

1151
01:44:12,682 --> 01:44:14,201
Or Felix does.

1152
01:44:48,287 --> 01:44:49,997
Merlin's beard, Harry!

1153
01:44:50,082 --> 01:44:50,928
Sorry, sir.

1154
01:44:51,415 --> 01:44:54,025
I should've announced myself.
Cleared my throat, coughed.

1155
01:44:54,709 --> 01:44:56,417
You probably feared
I was Professor Sprout.

1156
01:44:56,502 --> 01:44:59,418
Yes, I did, actually.
What makes you think that?

1157
01:45:00,260 --> 01:45:02,065
Well, just the general behavior, sir.

1158
01:45:02,362 --> 01:45:04,884
The sneaking around,
the jumping when you saw me.

1159
01:45:05,338 --> 01:45:08,614
Are those Tentacula leaves, sir?
They're very valuable, aren't they?

1160
01:45:09,136 --> 01:45:11,466
Ten Galleons a leaf to the right buyer.

1161
01:45:11,643 --> 01:45:13,895
Not that I'm familiar with any such
back alley transactions,

1162
01:45:13,980 --> 01:45:15,201
but one does hear rumors.

1163
01:45:15,286 --> 01:45:18,010
My own interests
are purely academic, of course.

1164
01:45:19,450 --> 01:45:21,768
Personally, these plants
always kind of freaked me out.

1165
01:45:25,485 --> 01:45:27,948
Exactly how did you get out
of the castle, Harry?

1166
01:45:28,033 --> 01:45:29,152
Through the front door, sir.

1167
01:45:29,603 --> 01:45:31,998
I'm off to Hagrid's.
He's a very dear friend...

1168
01:45:32,083 --> 01:45:33,718
...and I fancied paying him a visit.

1169
01:45:34,035 --> 01:45:35,976
So if you don't mind, I will be going now.

1170
01:45:37,069 --> 01:45:37,974
Harry!

1171
01:45:39,544 --> 01:45:41,535
- Sir?
- It's nearly nightfall.

1172
01:45:42,159 --> 01:45:45,723
Surely you realize I can't allow you
to go roaming the grounds by yourself.

1173
01:45:45,808 --> 01:45:47,634
Well, then, by all means, come along, sir.

1174
01:45:53,597 --> 01:45:57,059
<i>Harry, I must insist
you accompany me...</i>

1175
01:45:57,144 --> 01:45:58,979
<i>...back to the castle immediately!</i>

1176
01:45:59,215 --> 01:46:01,625
That would be counterproductive, sir.

1177
01:46:03,485 --> 01:46:04,999
And what makes you say that?

1178
01:46:06,864 --> 01:46:07,743
No idea.

1179
01:46:15,194 --> 01:46:16,102
Horace.

1180
01:46:17,170 --> 01:46:18,859
Merlin's beard.

1181
01:46:19,810 --> 01:46:21,678
Is that an actual Acromantula?

1182
01:46:23,059 --> 01:46:24,310
A dead one, I think, sir.

1183
01:46:26,003 --> 01:46:27,062
Good God.

1184
01:46:28,109 --> 01:46:30,440
Dear fellow,
however did you manage to kill it?

1185
01:46:31,648 --> 01:46:34,187
Kill it? Me oldest friend, he was.

1186
01:46:35,143 --> 01:46:38,587
- I'm so sorry, I didn't...
- Don't worry yourself, you're not alone.

1187
01:46:39,892 --> 01:46:42,713
Seriously misunderstood creatures,
spiders are.

1188
01:46:43,522 --> 01:46:45,722
It's the eyes, I reckon.
They unnerve some folk.

1189
01:46:46,152 --> 01:46:47,513
Not to mention the pincers.

1190
01:46:52,402 --> 01:46:53,617
Yeah, I reckon that too.

1191
01:46:54,778 --> 01:46:58,373
Hagrid, the last thing
I wish to be is indelicate...

1192
01:46:58,458 --> 01:47:01,973
...but Acromantular venom
is uncommonly rare.

1193
01:47:02,728 --> 01:47:05,116
Would you allow me
to extract a vial or two?

1194
01:47:05,200 --> 01:47:07,465
Purely for academic purposes,
you understand.

1195
01:47:08,040 --> 01:47:10,984
Well, I don't suppose it's going
to do him much good now, is it?

1196
01:47:11,069 --> 01:47:12,269
My thoughts exactly.

1197
01:47:12,500 --> 01:47:18,747
Always have an ampoule or two about
my person for just such occasions as this.

1198
01:47:19,157 --> 01:47:23,401
Old Potions Master's habit, you know.

1199
01:47:24,636 --> 01:47:26,404
I wish you could've seen him
in his prime.

1200
01:47:27,560 --> 01:47:28,867
Magnificent, he was.

1201
01:47:29,828 --> 01:47:31,164
Just magnificent.

1202
01:47:32,650 --> 01:47:33,539
Oh, dear.

1203
01:47:43,830 --> 01:47:46,349
- Would you like me to say a few words?
- Yes.

1204
01:47:47,410 --> 01:47:48,712
He had a family, I trust?

1205
01:47:48,990 --> 01:47:49,970
Oh, yeah.

1206
01:47:56,044 --> 01:47:57,544
Farewell...

1207
01:47:57,629 --> 01:47:58,646
Aragog.

1208
01:48:04,009 --> 01:48:06,753
Farewell, Aragog...

1209
01:48:07,309 --> 01:48:09,216
...king of the arachnids.

1210
01:48:10,809 --> 01:48:12,832
Your body will decay...

1211
01:48:14,648 --> 01:48:17,488
...but your spirit lingers on.

1212
01:48:18,198 --> 01:48:23,792
And your human friends find solace
in the loss they have sustained.

1213
01:48:40,007 --> 01:48:43,432
I had him from an egg, you know.
Tiny little thing he was when he hatched.

1214
01:48:43,693 --> 01:48:47,547
No bigger than a Pekinese.
A Pekinese, mind you.

1215
01:48:47,677 --> 01:48:48,916
How sweet.

1216
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:52,590
I once had a fish. Francis.
He was very dear to me.

1217
01:48:52,968 --> 01:48:57,713
One afternoon I came downstairs,
and he'd vanished.

1218
01:49:00,018 --> 01:49:02,390
- That's very odd, isn't it?
- It is, isn't it?

1219
01:49:02,683 --> 01:49:06,211
But that's life, I suppose.

1220
01:49:06,296 --> 01:49:11,757
You go along and then suddenly, poof!

1221
01:49:31,095 --> 01:49:33,491
It was a student who gave me Francis.

1222
01:49:35,225 --> 01:49:38,467
One spring afternoon
I discovered a bowl on my desk...

1223
01:49:40,220 --> 01:49:42,642
...with just a few inches
of clear water in it.

1224
01:49:44,123 --> 01:49:47,002
And floating on the surface
was a flower petal.

1225
01:49:49,164 --> 01:49:50,919
As I watched, it sank.

1226
01:49:53,244 --> 01:49:55,084
Just before it reached the bottom...

1227
01:49:56,244 --> 01:49:57,729
...it transformed...

1228
01:49:59,084 --> 01:50:00,449
...into a wee fish.

1229
01:50:02,584 --> 01:50:04,275
It was beautiful magic.

1230
01:50:05,714 --> 01:50:07,384
Wondrous to behold.

1231
01:50:10,594 --> 01:50:12,585
The flower petal had come from a lily.

1232
01:50:15,723 --> 01:50:16,614
Your mother.

1233
01:50:18,757 --> 01:50:20,575
The day I came downstairs...

1234
01:50:22,240 --> 01:50:23,707
...the day the bowl was empty...

1235
01:50:26,030 --> 01:50:27,401
...was the day your mother...

1236
01:50:32,212 --> 01:50:33,411
I know why you're here.

1237
01:50:37,123 --> 01:50:38,447
But I can't help you.

1238
01:50:40,986 --> 01:50:42,098
It would ruin me.

1239
01:50:46,502 --> 01:50:48,282
Do you know why I survived, professor?

1240
01:50:49,502 --> 01:50:50,596
The night I got this?

1241
01:50:53,092 --> 01:50:53,981
Because of her.

1242
01:50:55,576 --> 01:50:57,565
Because she sacrificed herself.

1243
01:50:57,852 --> 01:50:59,920
Because she refused to step aside.

1244
01:51:00,304 --> 01:51:03,622
Because her love was more powerful
than Voldemort.

1245
01:51:03,707 --> 01:51:04,585
Don't say his name.

1246
01:51:04,670 --> 01:51:06,631
I'm not afraid of the name, professor.

1247
01:51:08,318 --> 01:51:09,636
I'm going to tell you something.

1248
01:51:11,249 --> 01:51:13,425
Something others have only guessed at.

1249
01:51:16,280 --> 01:51:17,281
It's true.

1250
01:51:18,378 --> 01:51:19,600
I am the Chosen One.

1251
01:51:20,645 --> 01:51:22,956
Only I can destroy him,
but in order to do so...

1252
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:26,415
...I need to know what Tom Riddle
asked you years ago in your office...

1253
01:51:26,500 --> 01:51:28,225
...and I need to know what you told him.

1254
01:51:29,590 --> 01:51:31,164
Be brave, professor.

1255
01:51:33,630 --> 01:51:34,917
Be brave like my mother.

1256
01:51:36,938 --> 01:51:38,960
Otherwise, you disgrace her.

1257
01:51:40,712 --> 01:51:42,370
Otherwise, she died for nothing.

1258
01:51:43,829 --> 01:51:48,453
Otherwise, the bowl
will remain empty forever.

1259
01:51:59,869 --> 01:52:02,989
Please, don't think badly of me
when you see it.

1260
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:07,451
You've no idea what he was like,
even then.

1261
01:52:45,037 --> 01:52:46,609
I was in the library the other night...

1262
01:52:47,820 --> 01:52:49,438
...in the Restricted Section...

1263
01:52:49,988 --> 01:52:53,975
...and I read something rather odd
about a bit of rare magic.

1264
01:52:55,877 --> 01:52:57,885
It's called, as I understand it...

1265
01:52:59,926 --> 01:53:00,921
...a Horcrux.

1266
01:53:03,096 --> 01:53:05,182
- I beg your pardon?
- Horcrux.

1267
01:53:06,266 --> 01:53:07,935
I came across the term while reading...

1268
01:53:09,055 --> 01:53:11,214
...and I didn't fully understand it.

1269
01:53:11,845 --> 01:53:13,585
I'm not sure what you
were reading, Tom...

1270
01:53:13,670 --> 01:53:16,240
...but this is very dark stuff,
very dark indeed.

1271
01:53:16,936 --> 01:53:17,849
Which is...

1272
01:53:19,534 --> 01:53:20,869
...why I came to you.

1273
01:53:24,275 --> 01:53:28,943
A Horcrux is an object in which a person
has concealed part of their soul.

1274
01:53:29,757 --> 01:53:31,917
But I don't understand
how that works, sir.

1275
01:53:35,213 --> 01:53:38,231
One splits one's soul and hides
part of it in an object.

1276
01:53:39,465 --> 01:53:40,644
By doing so, you're protected,

1277
01:53:40,729 --> 01:53:42,905
should you be attacked
and your body destroyed.

1278
01:53:42,990 --> 01:53:43,872
Protected?

1279
01:53:44,473 --> 01:53:46,973
That part of your soul
that is hidden lives on.

1280
01:53:49,214 --> 01:53:51,082
In other words, you cannot die.

1281
01:53:58,814 --> 01:54:01,035
And how does one split his soul, sir?

1282
01:54:02,040 --> 01:54:04,120
I think you already know
the answer to that, Tom.

1283
01:54:06,154 --> 01:54:07,078
Murder.

1284
01:54:08,122 --> 01:54:09,037
Yes.

1285
01:54:10,034 --> 01:54:14,346
Killing rips the soul apart.
It is a violation against nature.

1286
01:54:15,918 --> 01:54:18,367
Can you only split the soul once?

1287
01:54:18,452 --> 01:54:20,668
For instance, isn't seven...?

1288
01:54:20,753 --> 01:54:21,676
Seven?

1289
01:54:23,003 --> 01:54:24,713
Merlin's beard, Tom.

1290
01:54:24,798 --> 01:54:27,530
Isn't it bad enough
to consider killing one person?

1291
01:54:28,368 --> 01:54:31,307
To rip the soul into seven pieces...

1292
01:54:33,383 --> 01:54:36,422
This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom?
All academic?

1293
01:54:41,182 --> 01:54:42,305
Of course, sir.

1294
01:54:45,482 --> 01:54:46,703
It'll be our little secret.

1295
01:54:56,282 --> 01:54:57,144
Sir.

1296
01:55:12,833 --> 01:55:14,862
This is beyond anything I imagined.

1297
01:55:14,947 --> 01:55:17,966
You mean to say he succeeded, sir,
in making a Horcrux?

1298
01:55:18,050 --> 01:55:21,266
Oh, yes, he succeeded, all right.
And not just once.

1299
01:55:21,350 --> 01:55:22,381
What are they exactly?

1300
01:55:22,466 --> 01:55:25,237
Could be anything.
Most commonplace of objects.

1301
01:55:28,789 --> 01:55:30,032
A ring, for example.

1302
01:55:31,400 --> 01:55:32,268
Or a book.

1303
01:55:34,094 --> 01:55:36,678
- Tom Riddle's diary.
- It's a Horcrux, yes.

1304
01:55:37,155 --> 01:55:39,222
Four years ago, when you saved
Ginny's life...

1305
01:55:39,307 --> 01:55:41,348
...in the Chamber of Secrets,
you brought me this.

1306
01:55:41,655 --> 01:55:43,825
I knew this was
a different kind of magic.

1307
01:55:43,910 --> 01:55:46,036
Very dark, very powerful.

1308
01:55:46,597 --> 01:55:49,113
But until tonight
I had no idea just how powerful.

1309
01:55:49,198 --> 01:55:51,374
- The ring?
- Belonged to Voldemort's mother.

1310
01:55:51,459 --> 01:55:55,925
Difficult to find.
Even more difficult to destroy.

1311
01:55:56,474 --> 01:55:59,875
But if you could find them all,
if you did destroy each Horcrux...

1312
01:55:59,960 --> 01:56:01,476
One destroys Voldemort.

1313
01:56:01,560 --> 01:56:04,692
But how would you find them?
They could be hidden anywhere.

1314
01:56:04,777 --> 01:56:07,856
True. But magic, especially dark magic...

1315
01:56:21,998 --> 01:56:23,044
...leaves traces.

1316
01:56:31,493 --> 01:56:32,940
It's where you've been going,
isn't it, sir?

1317
01:56:33,878 --> 01:56:35,817
- When you leave the school?
- Yes.

1318
01:56:37,055 --> 01:56:39,163
And I think perhaps
I may have found another.

1319
01:56:40,243 --> 01:56:43,739
But this time,
I cannot hope to destroy it alone.

1320
01:56:45,930 --> 01:56:49,886
Once again,
I must ask too much of you, Harry.

1321
01:56:54,480 --> 01:56:57,022
Have you ever considered
that you ask too much...

1322
01:56:57,107 --> 01:56:59,801
...that you take too much for granted?

1323
01:56:59,886 --> 01:57:04,926
Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind
that I don't want to do this anymore?

1324
01:57:05,010 --> 01:57:07,131
Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.

1325
01:57:08,116 --> 01:57:13,037
I will not negotiate with you, Severus.
You agreed. Nothing more to discuss.

1326
01:57:32,305 --> 01:57:33,175
Oh, Harry.

1327
01:57:36,525 --> 01:57:38,004
You need a shave, my friend.

1328
01:57:41,615 --> 01:57:45,089
You know, at times,
I forget how much you've grown.

1329
01:57:46,025 --> 01:57:49,174
At times, I still see the small boy
from the cupboard.

1330
01:57:51,534 --> 01:57:53,066
Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.

1331
01:57:54,374 --> 01:57:55,241
I'm an old man.

1332
01:57:55,993 --> 01:57:57,298
You still look the same to me, sir.

1333
01:57:59,164 --> 01:58:01,632
Just like your mother,
you're unfailingly kind.

1334
01:58:02,119 --> 01:58:04,733
A trait people never fail to undervalue,
I'm afraid.

1335
01:58:08,304 --> 01:58:11,887
The place to which we journey tonight
is extremely dangerous.

1336
01:58:12,973 --> 01:58:16,222
I promised you could accompany me,
and I stand by that promise.

1337
01:58:16,835 --> 01:58:17,977
But there is one condition.

1338
01:58:18,587 --> 01:58:21,787
You must obey every command
I give you, without question.

1339
01:58:22,677 --> 01:58:23,525
Yes, sir.

1340
01:58:24,420 --> 01:58:25,933
You do understand what I'm saying?

1341
01:58:27,233 --> 01:58:29,142
Should I tell you to hide, you hide.

1342
01:58:29,903 --> 01:58:31,780
Should I tell you to run, you run.

1343
01:58:32,564 --> 01:58:36,402
Should I tell you to abandon me
and save yourself, you must do so.

1344
01:58:41,582 --> 01:58:42,645
Your word, Harry.

1345
01:58:44,744 --> 01:58:45,601
My word.

1346
01:58:47,092 --> 01:58:48,031
Take my arm.

1347
01:58:50,172 --> 01:58:52,430
Sir, I thought you couldn't
Apparate within Hogwarts.

1348
01:58:53,300 --> 01:58:56,320
Well, being me has its privileges.

1349
01:59:43,749 --> 01:59:44,992
This is the place.

1350
01:59:46,328 --> 01:59:47,313
Oh, yes.

1351
01:59:48,835 --> 01:59:50,725
This place has known magic.

1352
01:59:59,400 --> 02:00:01,304
- Sir!
- In order to gain passage...

1353
02:00:01,389 --> 02:00:02,674
...payment must be made.

1354
02:00:02,759 --> 02:00:05,450
Payment intended
to weaken any intruder.

1355
02:00:07,999 --> 02:00:09,829
- You should've let me, sir.
- No, Harry.

1356
02:00:10,289 --> 02:00:12,360
Your blood's much more precious
than mine.

1357
02:00:34,898 --> 02:00:38,782
Voldemort will not have made it easy
to discover his hiding place.

1358
02:00:39,697 --> 02:00:42,319
He will have put certain defenses
in position.

1359
02:00:45,617 --> 02:00:46,532
Careful.

1360
02:01:10,556 --> 02:01:11,470
There it is.

1361
02:01:13,186 --> 02:01:15,176
The only question is,
how do we get there?

1362
02:01:38,195 --> 02:01:39,193
If you would, Harry.

1363
02:02:27,213 --> 02:02:28,869
Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?

1364
02:02:30,196 --> 02:02:31,052
Oh, yes.

1365
02:02:42,732 --> 02:02:43,951
It has to be drunk.

1366
02:02:44,750 --> 02:02:46,787
All of it has to be drunk.

1367
02:02:48,080 --> 02:02:50,581
You remember the conditions on which
I brought you with me?

1368
02:02:51,652 --> 02:02:53,404
This potion might paralyze me.

1369
02:02:54,492 --> 02:02:55,931
Might make me forget why I'm here.

1370
02:02:56,865 --> 02:02:59,567
Might cause me so much pain
that I beg for relief.

1371
02:03:00,342 --> 02:03:02,390
You are not to indulge these requests.

1372
02:03:02,475 --> 02:03:05,360
It's your job, Harry, to make sure
I keep drinking this potion.

1373
02:03:06,210 --> 02:03:08,472
Even if you have to force it
down my throat.

1374
02:03:09,155 --> 02:03:11,426
- Understood?
- Why can't I drink it, sir?

1375
02:03:11,510 --> 02:03:16,155
Because I am much older, much cleverer,
and much less valuable.

1376
02:03:20,850 --> 02:03:22,931
Your good health, Harry.

1377
02:03:38,960 --> 02:03:39,816
Professor.

1378
02:03:42,397 --> 02:03:43,320
Professor!

1379
02:03:50,379 --> 02:03:51,277
Harry.

1380
02:03:52,049 --> 02:03:54,335
Professor, can you hear me?

1381
02:03:55,823 --> 02:03:56,671
Professor.

1382
02:04:12,636 --> 02:04:13,756
No. Don't.

1383
02:04:13,840 --> 02:04:16,161
You have to keep drinking, like you said.
Remember?

1384
02:04:24,962 --> 02:04:27,119
- Stop.
- It will stop. It will stop...

1385
02:04:27,204 --> 02:04:31,729
- ...but only if you keep drinking.
- Please, don't make me.

1386
02:04:31,814 --> 02:04:34,043
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Please.

1387
02:04:34,128 --> 02:04:35,859
- Kill me. Kill me!
- No!

1388
02:04:38,640 --> 02:04:39,721
It's my fault.

1389
02:04:40,605 --> 02:04:42,509
It's all my fault.

1390
02:04:44,019 --> 02:04:45,385
It's my fault.

1391
02:04:45,890 --> 02:04:49,419
Just one more, sir.
One more, and then I promise...

1392
02:04:49,907 --> 02:04:51,751
...I promise I'll do what you say.

1393
02:04:52,729 --> 02:04:54,049
- I promise.
- No.

1394
02:04:55,487 --> 02:04:56,349
Please.

1395
02:05:20,918 --> 02:05:21,826
Harry.

1396
02:05:29,595 --> 02:05:30,514
Water.

1397
02:05:31,589 --> 02:05:32,462
Water.

1398
02:05:32,935 --> 02:05:33,802
Water.

1399
02:05:41,155 --> 02:05:42,174
You did it, sir.

1400
02:05:43,195 --> 02:05:44,090
Look.

1401
02:05:46,550 --> 02:05:47,435
Harry.

1402
02:05:49,029 --> 02:05:49,909
Water.

1403
02:05:52,310 --> 02:05:53,425
<i>Aguamenti.</i>

1404
02:05:54,244 --> 02:05:55,214
Water.

1405
02:06:31,790 --> 02:06:32,653
<i>Lumos.</i>

1406
02:07:01,690 --> 02:07:02,903
<i>Lumos Maxima!</i>

1407
02:07:13,223 --> 02:07:14,267
Harry.

1408
02:07:18,950 --> 02:07:20,197
<i>Sectumsempra!</i>

1409
02:07:20,282 --> 02:07:21,258
Harry.

1410
02:07:22,442 --> 02:07:23,646
<i>- Stupefy!
- Harry.</i>

1411
02:08:23,399 --> 02:08:24,246
Harry.

1412
02:08:28,478 --> 02:08:30,027
<i>Partis Temporus!</i>

1413
02:09:13,356 --> 02:09:15,655
Go to your houses. No dawdling.

1414
02:09:57,314 --> 02:10:01,100
We need to get you to the hospital
wing, sir, to Madam Pomfrey.

1415
02:10:03,419 --> 02:10:04,259
No.

1416
02:10:05,864 --> 02:10:08,271
Severus. Severus is who I need.

1417
02:10:08,704 --> 02:10:11,131
Wake him. Tell him what happened.

1418
02:10:12,413 --> 02:10:13,598
Speak to no one else.

1419
02:10:14,782 --> 02:10:16,302
Severus, Harry.

1420
02:10:22,213 --> 02:10:23,766
Hide yourself below, Harry.

1421
02:10:25,980 --> 02:10:28,824
Don't speak or be seen by anybody
without my permission.

1422
02:10:29,422 --> 02:10:32,534
Whatever happens,
it's imperative you stay below.

1423
02:10:33,853 --> 02:10:34,852
Harry, do as I say.

1424
02:10:39,094 --> 02:10:39,928
Trust me.

1425
02:10:42,192 --> 02:10:43,085
Trust me.

1426
02:11:04,210 --> 02:11:05,199
Good evening, Draco.

1427
02:11:06,849 --> 02:11:10,228
What brings you here
on this fine spring evening?

1428
02:11:10,543 --> 02:11:12,413
Who else is here? I heard you talking.

1429
02:11:12,498 --> 02:11:16,578
I often talk aloud to myself.
I find it extraordinarily useful.

1430
02:11:18,770 --> 02:11:20,676
Have you been whispering
to yourself, Draco?

1431
02:11:24,036 --> 02:11:24,875
Draco...

1432
02:11:26,158 --> 02:11:28,297
...you are no assassin.

1433
02:11:28,457 --> 02:11:29,532
How do you know what I am?

1434
02:11:29,880 --> 02:11:31,136
I've done things that would shock you.

1435
02:11:31,220 --> 02:11:35,434
Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping that in
return she'd bear a cursed necklace to me?

1436
02:11:35,608 --> 02:11:38,458
Replacing a bottle of mead
with one laced with poison?

1437
02:11:38,543 --> 02:11:39,594
Forgive me, Draco.

1438
02:11:39,982 --> 02:11:42,257
I cannot help feeling these actions
are so weak...

1439
02:11:42,342 --> 02:11:44,999
...that your heart can't really
have been in them.

1440
02:11:45,084 --> 02:11:47,350
He trusts me. I was chosen.

1441
02:11:52,535 --> 02:11:54,132
Then I shall make it easy for you.

1442
02:11:54,217 --> 02:11:55,127
<i>Expelliarmus!</i>

1443
02:11:59,072 --> 02:12:01,392
Very good. Very good.

1444
02:12:03,265 --> 02:12:04,307
You're not alone.

1445
02:12:05,924 --> 02:12:06,954
There are others.

1446
02:12:09,014 --> 02:12:09,944
How?

1447
02:12:11,723 --> 02:12:13,641
The vanishing cabinet
in the Room of Requirement.

1448
02:12:15,143 --> 02:12:17,027
- I've been mending it.
- Let me guess.

1449
02:12:17,675 --> 02:12:20,329
It has a sister. A twin.

1450
02:12:20,422 --> 02:12:22,949
In Borgin and Burkes.
They form a passage.

1451
02:12:23,343 --> 02:12:24,427
Ingenious.

1452
02:12:25,653 --> 02:12:26,514
Draco...

1453
02:12:27,376 --> 02:12:32,354
...years ago, I knew a boy
who made all the wrong choices.

1454
02:12:34,073 --> 02:12:35,153
Please let me help you.

1455
02:12:35,238 --> 02:12:36,282
I don't want your help!

1456
02:12:37,792 --> 02:12:40,886
Don't you understand? I have to do this.

1457
02:12:42,573 --> 02:12:43,769
I have to kill you.

1458
02:12:44,879 --> 02:12:46,222
Or he's gonna kill me.

1459
02:12:56,352 --> 02:12:59,428
Well, look what we have here.

1460
02:13:01,850 --> 02:13:03,598
Well done, Draco.

1461
02:13:07,746 --> 02:13:08,960
Good evening, Bellatrix.

1462
02:13:10,642 --> 02:13:12,802
I think introductions
are in order, don't you?

1463
02:13:12,887 --> 02:13:17,220
Love to, Albus, but I'm afraid
we're all on a bit of a tight schedule.

1464
02:13:18,677 --> 02:13:19,552
Do it.

1465
02:13:21,423 --> 02:13:24,770
He doesn't have the stomach,
just like his father.

1466
02:13:25,870 --> 02:13:27,455
Let me finish him in my own way.

1467
02:13:27,540 --> 02:13:30,589
No! The Dark Lord was clear,
the boy is to do it.

1468
02:13:31,340 --> 02:13:33,861
This is your moment. Do it.

1469
02:13:35,079 --> 02:13:37,005
Go on, Draco.

1470
02:13:37,090 --> 02:13:38,573
Now!

1471
02:13:40,510 --> 02:13:41,491
No.

1472
02:13:53,692 --> 02:13:54,697
Severus.

1473
02:14:04,353 --> 02:14:05,188
Please.

1474
02:14:06,702 --> 02:14:07,781
<i>Avada Kedavra.</i>

1475
02:15:12,602 --> 02:15:16,188
Hagrid! Hello?

1476
02:15:16,273 --> 02:15:19,656
Snape! He trusted you!

1477
02:15:24,525 --> 02:15:25,393
Go on.

1478
02:15:26,845 --> 02:15:28,200
<i>Incarcerous.</i>

1479
02:15:28,782 --> 02:15:31,551
Fight back! You coward, fight back!

1480
02:15:32,908 --> 02:15:36,397
No! He belongs to the Dark Lord.

1481
02:15:56,406 --> 02:15:57,685
<i>Sectumsempra!</i>

1482
02:16:06,192 --> 02:16:10,852
You dare use my own spells
against me, Potter?

1483
02:16:12,163 --> 02:16:13,020
Yes.

1484
02:16:14,088 --> 02:16:17,406
I'm the Half-Blood Prince.

1485
02:20:06,025 --> 02:20:07,008
Potter...

1486
02:20:08,377 --> 02:20:10,146
...in light of what has happened...

1487
02:20:12,296 --> 02:20:15,154
...if you should have the need
to talk to someone...

1488
02:20:17,667 --> 02:20:21,044
You should know,
Professor Dumbledore...

1489
02:20:23,490 --> 02:20:25,195
...you meant a great deal to him.

1490
02:20:44,150 --> 02:20:45,303
Do you think he would've done it?

1491
02:20:46,598 --> 02:20:47,465
Draco?

1492
02:20:49,425 --> 02:20:50,292
No.

1493
02:20:51,925 --> 02:20:53,423
No, he was lowering his wand.

1494
02:20:55,005 --> 02:20:56,220
In the end, it was Snape.

1495
02:20:57,705 --> 02:20:58,838
It was always Snape.

1496
02:21:00,422 --> 02:21:01,334
And I did nothing.

1497
02:21:09,207 --> 02:21:10,055
It's fake.

1498
02:21:12,104 --> 02:21:12,955
Open it.

1499
02:21:24,453 --> 02:21:25,781
"To the Dark Lord."

1500
02:21:26,804 --> 02:21:28,537
"I know I will be dead long
before you read this..."

1501
02:21:28,623 --> 02:21:31,295
"...but I want you to know that it was I
who discovered your secret."

1502
02:21:33,400 --> 02:21:37,258
"I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend
to destroy it as soon as I can."

1503
02:21:37,343 --> 02:21:40,642
"I face death in the hope that
when you meet your match..."

1504
02:21:40,727 --> 02:21:42,240
"...you will be mortal once more."

1505
02:21:44,164 --> 02:21:45,154
"R-A-B."

1506
02:21:47,013 --> 02:21:47,852
R-A-B.

1507
02:21:48,939 --> 02:21:49,777
Don't know.

1508
02:21:52,142 --> 02:21:54,257
But whoever they are,
they have the real Horcrux.

1509
02:21:55,898 --> 02:21:57,212
Which means it was all a waste.

1510
02:21:58,768 --> 02:21:59,630
All of it.

1511
02:22:06,467 --> 02:22:07,664
Ron's okay with it, you know.

1512
02:22:08,976 --> 02:22:09,839
You and Ginny.

1513
02:22:11,169 --> 02:22:13,953
But if I were you, when he's around,
I'd keep the snogging to a minimum.

1514
02:22:16,179 --> 02:22:17,477
I'm not coming back, Hermione.

1515
02:22:19,386 --> 02:22:21,848
I've got to finish
whatever Dumbledore started.

1516
02:22:22,378 --> 02:22:25,096
And I don't know where that'll lead me...

1517
02:22:25,180 --> 02:22:28,023
...but I'll let you and Ron know
where I am when I can.

1518
02:22:29,879 --> 02:22:31,992
I've always admired your courage, Harry.

1519
02:22:33,027 --> 02:22:34,897
But sometimes, you can be really thick.

1520
02:22:38,874 --> 02:22:40,321
You don't really think
you're going to be able...

1521
02:22:40,406 --> 02:22:42,657
...to find all those Horcruxes
by yourself, do you?

1522
02:22:47,779 --> 02:22:48,907
You need us, Harry.

1523
02:23:05,258 --> 02:23:07,507
I never realized
how beautiful this place was.
