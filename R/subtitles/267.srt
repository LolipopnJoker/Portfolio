1
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:18,394
Broke in right
on the two of them.

2
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:21,689
No matter what they say,
it's all about money.

3
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:25,109
So let's imagine, ladies, that you're
a Savings and Loan officer. Watch.

4
00:00:25,151 --> 00:00:28,070
One, two, three. See?

5
00:00:28,154 --> 00:00:30,281
You've got it all,
and we've got nothin'.

6
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:32,324
- And you have all four. Take a look.
- Oh!

7
00:00:32,408 --> 00:00:34,326
But I wouldn't trust you
with real gold.

8
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,954
- That's why this one's only worth about a penny.
- Hmm.

9
00:00:37,038 --> 00:00:39,665
And if you wonder where
the other one went, watch.

10
00:00:39,749 --> 00:00:42,043
A penny from the ear.
How much for the rest?

11
00:00:42,126 --> 00:00:44,545
- Have you seen Edward?
- No, I haven't. Great party, Philip.

12
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:47,131
My wife went to a lot of trouble;
she called a caterer.

13
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,342
- Excuse me, Ann. Howard, how are you?
- Philip, good.

14
00:00:49,425 --> 00:00:51,427
Hey, I understand Edward's
taking over Morse Industries.

15
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,679
- Yeah, well, he's not here to get a suntan.
- Can I get in on it?

16
00:00:53,763 --> 00:00:55,681
- Yeah. Call me.
- When?

17
00:00:55,765 --> 00:00:57,683
Just call me.

18
00:00:57,767 --> 00:01:00,603
- Uh, hi. I'm Philip Stuckey, Edward Lewis's lawyer.
- Where's the guest of honor?

19
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:03,314
He's probably off in a corner
somewhere charming a very pretty lady.

20
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:05,191
How are you?

21
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:08,819
I told my secretary to make the
arrangements. Didn't she call you?

22
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:12,823
Yes, she did. I speak to
your secretary more than I speak to you.

23
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:15,701
- I see.
- I have my own life too, you know, Edward.

24
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:18,704
This is a very important week
for me. I need you here.

25
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:23,042
But you never give me any notice. You
just think I'm at your beck and call.

26
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:26,170
I do not believe that you
are at my beck and call.

27
00:01:26,212 --> 00:01:28,214
Well, that's the way
you always make me feel.

28
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,966
- Maybe I should just move out.
- If that's what you want, yes.

29
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,010
All right, when you get back
to New York, we'll discuss it.

30
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:35,596
- Now is as good a time as any.
- That's fine with me, Edward. Good-bye.

31
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,598
Good-bye, Jessica.

32
00:01:43,396 --> 00:01:46,148
- Phil suggested that maybe I should
take a I- - Phil is just my lawyer, okay?

33
00:01:46,232 --> 00:01:49,110
- Yes, sir.
- How did the Morse stock open at the Nikkei?

34
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:52,571
- I don't know.
- You don't know? Tokyo opened maybe 90 minutes ago.

35
00:01:52,655 --> 00:01:53,873
You have to keep on top
of these things, all right?

36
00:01:53,965 --> 00:01:54,573
Done.

37
00:01:54,657 --> 00:01:56,617
- Hello, Mr. Lewis.
- Hi. How you doin'? I want this whole thing...

38
00:01:56,701 --> 00:01:59,078
wrapped up as soon as possible;
I gotta get to New York by Sunday.

39
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:01,038
- I got tickets to the Met.
- Yes, sir.

40
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:04,417
- Your coat, Mr. Lewis.
- Thank you.

41
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,086
- Edward!
- Susan!

42
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,088
- Hi.
- Hi.

43
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:12,008
- I was sorry to hear about Carter.
- Oh, yeah. Thanks.

44
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:16,429
- Heard you got married.
- Well... yeah. I couldn't wait for you!

45
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,181
Mmm. Susan, tell me something.

46
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:22,727
- Yes?
- When you and I were dating,

47
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,938
did you speak to my secretary
more than you spoke to me?

48
00:02:26,022 --> 00:02:28,607
She was one of my bridesmaids.

49
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:33,070
Hmm. Your husband's
a very lucky guy.

50
00:02:33,112 --> 00:02:35,489
- Bye.
- Thanks, bye.

51
00:02:35,573 --> 00:02:37,491
- Do you?
- Absolutely.

52
00:02:37,575 --> 00:02:39,785
- Wonderful.
- He's leaving. Edward's leaving.

53
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:42,830
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

54
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:46,000
Is this Mr. Stuckey's car?

55
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,044
Edward,
where you goin'?

56
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:51,172
- You got the keys to your car?
- Why, what's wrong with the limo?

57
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:53,924
Look, the limo is buried back
there. Darryl can't get it out.

58
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:55,968
- Please give me the keys.
- All right, look.

59
00:02:56,052 --> 00:02:58,429
I don't think you should drive. You're
a little excited. Don't drive my car.

60
00:02:58,471 --> 00:03:01,098
Let me work something out here. Fellas,
what kind of a system is this?

61
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:03,267
Can you move these cars out
of here? Look, Edward.

62
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:06,312
- Edward. Uh, are you familiar with a stick shift?
- Uh, yeah.

63
00:03:06,354 --> 00:03:08,314
- Have you driven a shift? Listen, all right.
- Yeah. Yeah.

64
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:10,649
Just be ginger with it. It's a new car.

65
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,651
- Don't, uh- Just don't-
- Okay. I can do it.

66
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,653
Edward! Give me a break, please!

67
00:03:14,737 --> 00:03:15,515
I love this car.

68
00:03:15,637 --> 00:03:17,615
I love it too. Look, you don't even know
where you're going.

69
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:19,784
You're gonna get lost in the dark!

70
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:23,996
Beverly Hills is down the hill!

71
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:29,794
I don't need
to fall at your feet

72
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:33,464
Just 'cause you cut me
to the bone

73
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:38,803
- And I won't miss
the way that you kiss me

74
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:44,266
- Oh, shit.
- We were never carved in stone

75
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:48,979
If I don't listen
to the talk of the town

76
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:52,983
Then maybe I can fool myself

77
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:57,029
I'll get over you
I know I will

78
00:03:57,113 --> 00:04:00,991
I'll pretend my ship's
not sinking

79
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:05,788
And I'll tell myself
I'm over you

80
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:09,417
- 'Cause I'm the king of wishful thinking
- Maps here. Maps.

81
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,753
Have a good one.

82
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:18,175
What do you say, blondie?
- Hi, honey, want some fun?

83
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:23,222
- Hey, baby, you lookin' for a date?
- Yeah, honey, we're lookin'.

84
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:27,018
- Here I am.
- I'm Al and this is my friend Bill. Get in the car.

85
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:02,428
Well, I'm just goin' to school
like I'm real, real cool

86
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,056
Gotta dance like a fool
Got the message

87
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:08,934
And I gotta be a wild one
Ooh, yeah

88
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:11,937
I'm a wild one

89
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:15,483
Gonna break the news
Gonna keep on moving wild

90
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:18,778
Gonna keep on swingin', baby
I'm a real wild child

91
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:27,453
Now, wait a minute.
You don't seem to understand me.

92
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:31,499
That's my job. At the end of the month,
I collect everybody's rent.

93
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:35,252
Now give me the money,
or you're outta here.

94
00:05:37,797 --> 00:05:40,800
Gonna meet all my friends
Gonna have myself a ball

95
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,928
Gonna tell my friends
Gonna tell them all

96
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:46,305
That I'm a wild one

97
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:49,183
Ooh, yeah
I'm a wild one

98
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:53,604
Gonna break the news
Gonna keep on moving wild

99
00:05:53,646 --> 00:05:57,983
Gonna keep on swinging, baby
I'm a real wild child

100
00:06:15,668 --> 00:06:19,255
I'm a real wild one
and I like wild fun

101
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:22,466
In a world going crazy
everything seems hazy

102
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:27,096
I'm a wild one
Ooh, yeah, I'm a wild one

103
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:31,726
Gonna break the news
Gonna keep on moving wild

104
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:36,022
Gonna keep on swinging, baby
I'm a real wild child

105
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:38,649
Welcome to Hollywood!

106
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:40,818
Everybody comes to Hollywood
got a dream.

107
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:44,113
What's your dream?
What's your dream?

108
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:47,491
Hey, mister?
Hey, what's your dream?

109
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:49,493
Have a good one.

110
00:06:51,871 --> 00:06:55,750
- What happened?
- Some chick. She bought it over there.

111
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,669
Detective Albertson. What do
you know about that girl?

112
00:06:58,753 --> 00:07:00,921
I tell you, man. I don't
know who she hang with.

113
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:04,091
C'mon, guy. We just pulled her out of a
Dumpster in the back. Who was her pimp?

114
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:06,344
Cocaine her pimp. She a strawberry.

115
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:11,182
She be out on these streets day in, day
out, tradin' her sorry self for some crack.

116
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:13,684
- And what do you do?
- I cool.

117
00:07:13,768 --> 00:07:16,854
Oh, I'll bet.
Hey, hey, hey! Excuse me! Excuse me!

118
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,607
- What are you, from the press?
- No, no. We're from Orlando.

119
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:22,818
Oh, I don't believe this. Do you- I
got tourists photographing the body, Al.

120
00:07:22,902 --> 00:07:25,613
What happened?

121
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,627
In a world that can be
so insane

122
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:44,298
I don't think it's very strange for me
to be in love with you

123
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:48,761
I wanna know more
than your brain

124
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:50,763
Hey, Pops, has Kit
been in here?

125
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:53,891
Upstairs in the poolroom.

126
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:58,145
Now I smile for your affection
We have made a soul connection

127
00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:00,189
Just for whom
does your bell toll

128
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:03,150
Don't be cruel
Show me your soul

129
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:05,152
Yo, Viv!

130
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:08,239
- Is it all gone?
- Carlos, you know my roommate, Vivian.

131
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:11,867
- This is Angel. That's the Dude.
- I know everybody! Is it all gone, Kit?

132
00:08:11,951 --> 00:08:15,246
Carlos sold me some great shit. We just
had this party. I was the hostess.

133
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:18,708
I can't believe you bought drugs with
our rent. What is goin' on with you, Kit?

134
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:21,252
I needed a little pick-me-up.

135
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,337
- Well, we need rent money!
- Oh, calm down, chica.

136
00:08:23,421 --> 00:08:25,381
- She only owes me 200 more.
- Carlos!

137
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:27,758
- Another $200?
- That was from way before.

138
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:31,345
That's right, 200, Vivian. But if
you wanna work off her money with me,

139
00:08:31,429 --> 00:08:35,516
- we can work something out.
- That's a very sweet offer, Carlos, but not now.

140
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,560
- Come on, Viv. Come downstairs.
- Work out- Work out what?

141
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:41,022
- What are we gonna work out?
- You really like her, Carlos?

142
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:43,065
You took it
while I was sleeping?

143
00:08:43,107 --> 00:08:45,484
- You were unavailable for consultation.
- Hey, let's go.

144
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:48,612
Snack! Snack!

145
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:52,283
- Besides, it's my apartment.
- Yeah, well, I have to live there too, Kit.

146
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:55,369
Look, you came here; I gave you some
money; I gave you a place to stay...

147
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:57,705
and some valuable
vocational advice.

148
00:08:57,747 --> 00:08:59,707
He was on my case.
I had to give him something.

149
00:08:59,749 --> 00:09:01,876
So don't irritate me.

150
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:05,212
- This ain't a buffet, Kit.
- Irritate you?

151
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:09,216
Irritate you? I just saw a girl
pulled out of a Dumpster.

152
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,554
I know. Skinny Marie.
But... she was a- a flake.

153
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:16,724
She was a crack head. Dominic was trying
to straighten her out for months.

154
00:09:16,766 --> 00:09:20,394
Leave her alone!

155
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:22,438
Don't you want
to get outta here?

156
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,567
Get outta where?
Where the fuck you wanna go?

157
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:29,070
Aah, nothin' but garbage.

158
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:31,822
- Uh, excuse me.
- Huh?

159
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:34,825
- Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
- You're here!

160
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:38,079
That's Sylvester Stallone's
house right there.

161
00:09:38,162 --> 00:09:40,998
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

162
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:45,086
- Hey, yo, Rachel.
- What?

163
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:48,631
- Yeah. You see the stars on the sidewalk, babe?
- Yeah.

164
00:09:48,673 --> 00:09:52,051
Well, Vivian and me, we work Bob Hope,
we work the Ritz Brothers,

165
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:55,471
we work Fred Astaire, we work all
the way down to Ella Fitzgerald.

166
00:09:55,513 --> 00:09:58,974
This is our turf. We got seniority.
You better get off our corner.

167
00:09:59,058 --> 00:10:02,311
Forgive me. I was just takin'
a rest here. Besides, she's new.

168
00:10:02,395 --> 00:10:06,649
Yeah. Well, I'm old, so go rest up
by Monty Hall or Esther Wilson.

169
00:10:06,691 --> 00:10:08,859
- Williams.
- Esther Williams! Where you belong!

170
00:10:08,943 --> 00:10:12,530
Back off, Kit. You know,
you're really becoming a grouch.

171
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:15,825
- Am I really a grouch?
- Yes.

172
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:17,827
Sometimes.

173
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:21,163
Well, just 'cause I'm hungry.
I'm gonna go get something to eat.

174
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:24,542
- Hey, girls.
- Hey, yo, baby!

175
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,627
How about a freebie?
It's my birthday.

176
00:10:26,711 --> 00:10:28,671
Dream on!

177
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,967
It's lookin'
really slow tonight.

178
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:38,723
Yeah, well... maybe we should get a
pimp, you know. Carlos really digs you.

179
00:10:38,806 --> 00:10:41,851
And then he'll run our lives
and take our money. No.

180
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:45,479
You're right. We say who,
we say when, we say how much.

181
00:10:47,857 --> 00:10:50,860
- Do you think I look like Carol Channing?
- No! I love this look.

182
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:54,655
It's very glamorous. Glamour choice.

183
00:10:54,697 --> 00:10:56,657
Oh, yo, oh, yo.
Catch this!

184
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:01,412
Wait a minute.
That's a Lotus Esprit.

185
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:07,335
No, that's rent. You should go for him.
You look hot tonight.

186
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:11,047
Don't take less than a hundred. Call me
when you're through. Take care of you.

187
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:14,175
Take care of you.

188
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:19,680
Work it. Work it, baby.
Work it!

189
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:22,350
Work it. Own it.

190
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:25,519
Yes, you can handle this.

191
00:11:25,603 --> 00:11:28,689
First is here somewhere.

192
00:11:28,773 --> 00:11:31,525
Hey, sugar, you lookin'
for a date?

193
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:34,195
No, I wanna find Beverly Hills.
Can you give me directions?

194
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:36,864
Sure. For five bucks.

195
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:40,534
- Ridiculous.
- Price just went up to ten.

196
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:43,579
You can't charge me
for directions.

197
00:11:43,621 --> 00:11:46,290
I can do anything I want to,
baby. I ain't lost.

198
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:53,255
All right, okay?

199
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:56,592
All right. You win, I lose.
Got change for a 20?

200
00:11:56,676 --> 00:12:00,388
For 20, I'll show you personal.
Even show you where the stars live.

201
00:12:00,471 --> 00:12:04,293
Oh, that's all right.
I already been to Stallone's.

202
00:12:04,471 --> 00:12:05,893
Right. Uh, down the street.

203
00:12:07,478 --> 00:12:11,440
Lights! Lights would be good here.

204
00:12:12,595 --> 00:12:14,595
It's a little, a little temperamental.

205
00:12:16,696 --> 00:12:18,988
Yours?
No,it isn't

206
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:19,739
Stolen?

207
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,949
Not Exactly

208
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,868
What's your name?

209
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:27,163
What do you want it to be?

210
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:32,711
- Vivian. My name is Vivian.
- Vivian.

211
00:12:33,421 --> 00:12:36,673
- So, what hotel you stayin' at?
- The, uh, Regent Beverly Wilshire.

212
00:12:36,674 --> 00:12:39,300
Down the block,
right at the corner.

213
00:12:44,974 --> 00:12:49,352
Man, this baby must corner
like it's on rails!

214
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:51,354
I beg your pardon?

215
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:54,357
Well, doesn't it blow your mind?
This is only four cylinders.

216
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:57,777
- You know about cars.
Where did that come from?

217
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:00,488
Road and Track. The boys
back home I grew up with,

218
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:03,491
they were really into American
heavy metal: Mustangs, Corvettes.

219
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:06,328
They bought 'em cheap and fixed 'em up.
I paid attention.

220
00:13:06,329 --> 00:13:08,997
So how is it you know
so little about cars?

221
00:13:08,998 --> 00:13:12,167
My first car
was a limousine.

222
00:13:12,168 --> 00:13:14,627
- Oh.
- So where is this...

223
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:18,673
heavy metal... home?

224
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:21,509
Millage Ville, Georgia.

225
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,678
You know, I think you left
your transmission back there.

226
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:26,348
- You're not shifting right.
This is a standard "H."

227
00:13:26,349 --> 00:13:28,850
Standard "H." Like I know
what that means.

228
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:33,188
Have you ever driven a Lotus?

229
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,857
- No.
- You're gonna start right now.

230
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:41,154
- You're joking.
- No. It's the only way I can get you off my coat.

231
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:47,535
Fasten your seat belts. I am taking you
for the ride of your life.

232
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:49,505
I'm gonna show you what this car can really do.
Are you ready?

233
00:13:49,636 --> 00:13:50,705
I am ready.

234
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:54,376
- Hang on. -
Okay. - Here we go.

235
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:02,425
This has pedals like a race car.
They're really close together.

236
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:07,389
So it's probably easier for a woman to
drive, 'cause they have little feet.

237
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,391
Except me.
I wear a size nine.

238
00:14:09,392 --> 00:14:13,061
You know your foot's as big as
your arm from your elbow to your wrist?

239
00:14:13,062 --> 00:14:15,063
Did you know that?

240
00:14:15,064 --> 00:14:19,734
- No, I didn't know that.
- It's a little bit of trivia.

241
00:14:22,071 --> 00:14:26,700
Tell me, what kind of- what kind of
money you girls make these days?

242
00:14:26,701 --> 00:14:28,702
Ballpark.

243
00:14:28,703 --> 00:14:31,538
Can't take less than $100.

244
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:35,041
- A hundred dollars a night.
- For an hour.

245
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:37,085
An hour?

246
00:14:37,086 --> 00:14:40,755
You make $100 an hour and you got
a safety pin holding your boot up?

247
00:14:40,756 --> 00:14:42,757
You gotta be joking.

248
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:46,886
- I never joke about money.
- Neither do I.

249
00:14:47,555 --> 00:14:49,889
Hundred dollars an hour.

250
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,809
Pretty stiff.

251
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:59,190
Well, no.
But it's got potential.

252
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,209
Good evening, Mr. Lewis.

253
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,378
Will you be needing the car
anymore tonight?

254
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:24,924
I- I hope not!

255
00:15:25,301 --> 00:15:28,928
Ah. We're here.

256
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:31,848
Yeah.

257
00:15:34,018 --> 00:15:36,311
So you'll be all right?

258
00:15:36,312 --> 00:15:40,065
Yeah, I'm gonna grab a cab
with my twenty bucks.

259
00:15:40,066 --> 00:15:44,486
- Go back to your office.
- Yeah.

260
00:15:44,487 --> 00:15:47,030
My office. Yeah.

261
00:15:47,031 --> 00:15:51,034
Well, thanks for the ride.

262
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:54,954
- See you.
- Good-bye.

263
00:16:07,218 --> 00:16:10,178
No taxis?

264
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:13,890
No, I like the bus.

265
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:20,021
I was thinking-
Did you really say $100 an hour?

266
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:22,941
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

267
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:26,444
Well, if you don't have
any prior engagements,

268
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:30,073
I'd be very pleased if you would
accompany me into the hotel.

269
00:16:30,074 --> 00:16:33,034
You got it.

270
00:16:33,995 --> 00:16:37,497
What is your name?

271
00:16:37,498 --> 00:16:41,167
Edward. That's my favorite name
in the whole world!

272
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:44,129
- No!
- I tell you what, this is fate, Edward.

273
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:47,716
That's what this is.

274
00:16:47,717 --> 00:16:51,594
- Why don't you put this on?
- Why?

275
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:56,599
Well, this hotel is not the kind of
establishment that rents rooms by the hour.

276
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,561
Ah.

277
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:08,069
- Wow!
- It's all right.

278
00:17:10,448 --> 00:17:13,491
- Holy shit.
- You're gonna be fine.

279
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:18,038
Come with me.
And stop fidgeting.

280
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:20,999
- Good evening, Mr. Lewis.
- Hello. You have messages?

281
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,210
- Yes, we have several.
- Thank you.

282
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:30,885
Could you send up some champagne
and strawberries, please?

283
00:17:30,923 --> 00:17:31,885
Of course.

284
00:17:31,886 --> 00:17:35,221
Room service
for Mr. Lewis, please.

285
00:17:45,358 --> 00:17:47,609
Oh, honey.

286
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:52,489
You know what's happened?
I've got a runner in my pantyhose.

287
00:17:52,948 --> 00:17:55,325
I'm not wearing pantyhose.

288
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:04,042
Well, color me happy!
There's a sofa in here for two.

289
00:18:04,794 --> 00:18:09,047
- First time in an elevator.
- Ah.

290
00:18:09,048 --> 00:18:12,509
Close your mouth, dear.

291
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,971
Sorry, I couldn't help it.

292
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:19,891
Try.

293
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,774
- Penthouse.
- The penthouse.

294
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:30,318
- Yes.
- Mmm.

295
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:33,279
- To the left.
- Oh.

296
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:52,841
Oh, I miss keys.

297
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:08,857
Impressed?

298
00:19:08,858 --> 00:19:11,359
You kidding me?
I come here all the time.

299
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,381
As a matter of fact, they do
rent this room by the hour.

300
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,781
Sure they do.

301
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:19,617
Wow, great view!

302
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:22,330
I bet you can see all the way
to the ocean from out here.

303
00:19:22,518 --> 00:19:23,830
I'll take your word for it.

304
00:19:23,831 --> 00:19:27,167
- I don't go out there.
- Why don't you go out there?

305
00:19:27,168 --> 00:19:30,670
- I'm afraid of heights.
- You are?

306
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:32,922
So how come you
rented the penthouse?

307
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:36,885
It's the best. I looked all around
for penthouses on the first floor,

308
00:19:36,886 --> 00:19:39,846
but I can't find one.

309
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:45,560
Well, now that you have me here,
what are you going to do with me?

310
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:49,230
- Want to know something? I don't have a clue.
- No?

311
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:51,566
I hadn't exactly planned this.

312
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:54,361
Well, do you plan everything?

313
00:19:54,362 --> 00:19:58,239
- Always.
- Yeah. Me too.

314
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,701
I'm actually- No, I'm not a planner.
I wouldn't say I was a planner.

315
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:05,747
I would say I was, um, a kind of
"fly by the seat of my pants" gal.

316
00:20:05,748 --> 00:20:10,877
You know, moment to moment.
That's me. That's- Yeah.

317
00:20:11,087 --> 00:20:15,507
Mm-hmm. You know,
you could pay me.

318
00:20:15,508 --> 00:20:17,592
That's one way
to maybe break the ice.

319
00:20:17,593 --> 00:20:22,347
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry.
Uh, I assume cash is acceptable.

320
00:20:22,348 --> 00:20:25,600
Cash works for me, yeah.

321
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:35,527
You're on my fax.

322
00:20:35,778 --> 00:20:40,073
Well, that's one I haven't
been on before.

323
00:20:41,242 --> 00:20:43,451
Cute. She's very cute. Thank you.

324
00:20:43,452 --> 00:20:45,954
All right. Here we go.

325
00:20:45,955 --> 00:20:48,748
Pick one. I got red,
I got green, I got yellow.

326
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:51,960
I'm out of purple, but I do
have one gold circle coin left.

327
00:20:51,961 --> 00:20:56,131
The condom of champions. The one and only.
Nothing is gettin' through this sucker.

328
00:20:56,132 --> 00:20:58,967
- What d'you say? Hmm?
- A buffet of safety.

329
00:20:58,968 --> 00:21:02,387
I'm a safety girl.

330
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,600
- All right, let's get
one of these on you.

331
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:10,478
No. I-

332
00:21:12,481 --> 00:21:14,983
Why don't we just talk
for a little bit, okay?

333
00:21:14,984 --> 00:21:20,572
Talk. Yeah... uh... okay.

334
00:21:21,198 --> 00:21:25,744
Edward, are you in town
on, uh, business or pleasure?

335
00:21:25,745 --> 00:21:28,955
- Business, I think.
- Business, you think.

336
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:33,752
Well... let me guess.

337
00:21:33,753 --> 00:21:38,006
That would make you...
a lawyer.

338
00:21:38,007 --> 00:21:40,967
- A lawyer.
- Mm-hmm.

339
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:44,596
- What makes you think I'm a lawyer?
- You've got that, um...

340
00:21:44,597 --> 00:21:47,265
sharp, useless look
about you.

341
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:50,852
I bet you've known a lot of lawyers.

342
00:21:50,853 --> 00:21:53,521
I've known a lot
of everybody.

343
00:21:55,608 --> 00:21:59,444
What is that?

344
00:21:59,445 --> 00:22:02,781
- Champagne.
- Oh! Well.

345
00:22:02,782 --> 00:22:06,284
Might as well
make myself useful.

346
00:22:06,285 --> 00:22:10,997
Take a load off.

347
00:22:14,293 --> 00:22:17,921
- Good evening.
- Hi.

348
00:22:18,923 --> 00:22:22,467
- Uh, where would you like it?
- Where would we like it?

349
00:22:22,468 --> 00:22:25,512
Uh, over by the bar.

350
00:22:32,061 --> 00:22:34,062
Excuse me!

351
00:22:34,063 --> 00:22:36,064
It'll be on your bill,
Mr. Lewis.

352
00:22:36,065 --> 00:22:38,983
Thank you.

353
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:42,737
What are you lookin' at?

354
00:22:42,738 --> 00:22:48,118
- What is he lookin' at?
- Ah, yes. Here you go. Thank you very much.

355
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:50,120
Thank you very much, sir.
Have a nice night.

356
00:22:50,121 --> 00:22:54,124
A tip. Wow.
I missed that one. Oh.

357
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:56,167
- Stupid.
- Don't worry about it.

358
00:22:56,168 --> 00:22:58,294
- You mind if I take my boots off?
- Not at all.

359
00:22:58,295 --> 00:23:03,591
- So, do you have a wife? Girlfriend?
- I have both.

360
00:23:03,592 --> 00:23:07,470
Where are they? Shopping together?

361
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:13,226
My ex-wife... is now in Long Island...
in my ex-home...

362
00:23:13,227 --> 00:23:16,855
with my ex-dog.

363
00:23:17,982 --> 00:23:23,528
There you go. My ex-girlfriend,
Jessica, is in New York...

364
00:23:23,529 --> 00:23:28,408
moving out of my apartment
even as we speak.

365
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:36,291
Why don't you try a strawberry?

366
00:23:36,292 --> 00:23:40,628
- Why?
- It brings out the flavor in the champagne.

367
00:23:40,629 --> 00:23:43,548
Oh, groovy.

368
00:23:50,306 --> 00:23:53,224
Pretty good.

369
00:23:55,144 --> 00:23:58,730
- Don't you drink?
- No.

370
00:24:01,317 --> 00:24:05,111
Listen, I- I appreciate this whole
seduction scene you've got goin',

371
00:24:05,112 --> 00:24:07,864
but let me give you a tip:
I'm a sure thing, okay?

372
00:24:07,865 --> 00:24:10,867
So, I'm on an hourly rate.
Could we just move it along?

373
00:24:10,868 --> 00:24:14,079
Somehow I'm sensing that this time
problem is a major issue with you.

374
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,081
Why don't we just
get through that right now?

375
00:24:16,082 --> 00:24:19,709
- Great, let's get started.
- How much for the entire night?

376
00:24:20,294 --> 00:24:23,880
Stay here?

377
00:24:23,881 --> 00:24:26,299
You couldn't afford it.

378
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:30,261
- Try me.
- $300.

379
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:35,350
Done. Thank you.
Now we can relax.

380
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,070
I'll be out in just a minute.
That champagne kind of got to me.

381
00:24:47,071 --> 00:24:49,072
- I didn't hear you. What did you say?
- Uh...

382
00:24:49,073 --> 00:24:51,950
I said I'd be out
in just a minute.

383
00:24:51,951 --> 00:24:54,244
What is- What do you have
in, uh, your hand there?

384
00:24:54,245 --> 00:24:58,581
- What are you hiding?
- Nothing.

385
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:03,253
All right, look.
I do not want any drugs here.

386
00:25:03,254 --> 00:25:06,131
I don't want any of this. Get your
things and your money and please leave.

387
00:25:06,132 --> 00:25:08,341
I don't do drugs, all right?
I- I stopped doing drugs when I was 14.

388
00:25:08,342 --> 00:25:12,512
What is this?
What is this?

389
00:25:14,098 --> 00:25:17,100
- This is dental floss.
- Yeah? So?

390
00:25:17,101 --> 00:25:23,148
I had all those strawberry seeds.
And you shouldn't neglect your gums.

391
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:26,359
I'm sorry.
Please continue.

392
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,279
Thank you.

393
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:39,247
- Are you gonna watch?
- No, I'm going.

394
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:44,502
Thank you.

395
00:25:44,503 --> 00:25:48,423
It's just that, uh,
very few people surprise me.

396
00:25:48,424 --> 00:25:53,094
Yeah, well, you're lucky.
Most of 'em shock the hell outta me.

397
00:25:56,557 --> 00:26:00,435
- You're watching.
- I'm going.

398
00:26:13,908 --> 00:26:16,826
Yes, that may be true, Vance.

399
00:26:16,827 --> 00:26:21,081
Yes, I know, but I still need
the numbers on Morse Industries.

400
00:26:21,082 --> 00:26:23,750
Uh-huh.
I've got 'em from London;

401
00:26:23,751 --> 00:26:25,919
I need 'em now from Tokyo.

402
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,589
I'll call down and get them when
I want them. Thank you very much.

403
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:35,178
I have a little carpet picnic here.
Are you sure you don't want a drink?

404
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:39,015
I'm high on life. Can't you tell?

405
00:26:49,819 --> 00:26:52,654
You know, I never
saw this episode.

406
00:28:33,673 --> 00:28:36,549
What do you want?

407
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,677
What do you do?

408
00:28:38,678 --> 00:28:41,346
Everything.

409
00:28:41,347 --> 00:28:43,390
But I don't kiss on the mouth.

410
00:28:43,391 --> 00:28:47,018
Neither do I.

411
00:29:46,912 --> 00:29:49,164
- Hey, how you doing there?
- All right.

412
00:29:49,165 --> 00:29:51,541
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, Mr. Thompson.

413
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:54,085
- Good morning, good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

414
00:29:54,086 --> 00:29:56,087
- Good morning, Mr. Thompson.
- Good morning, Marjorie.

415
00:29:56,088 --> 00:29:58,548
Of course Morse is going to fight.
It's to be expected.

416
00:29:58,549 --> 00:30:00,633
He's run his company
for a very long time now.

417
00:30:00,634 --> 00:30:03,470
I don't think he's ready to have
his name taken off the stationery.

418
00:30:03,471 --> 00:30:05,805
He wants to meet you
face to face.

419
00:30:05,806 --> 00:30:08,600
- I wouldn't do it.
- Sure, you wouldn't. But do it anyhow.

420
00:30:08,601 --> 00:30:10,602
Tonight. Dinner. Set it up.

421
00:30:10,603 --> 00:30:13,521
Oh, Edward, Edward. I- Look, it's
really not a good idea that you see him.

422
00:30:13,522 --> 00:30:16,816
Definitely not alone.
You know? He's a feisty old guy.

423
00:30:16,817 --> 00:30:19,527
You know, we say the wrong thing,
we could wind up in court.

424
00:30:19,528 --> 00:30:21,988
Well, you know, there's always a
possibility things are gonna go wrong.

425
00:30:21,989 --> 00:30:27,202
That's why I enjoy this so much.
Oh, by the way, Phil, about your car.

426
00:30:27,203 --> 00:30:30,955
- Oh, God. What?
- It corners like it's on rails.

427
00:30:30,956 --> 00:30:35,627
What? What does
that mean? Edward? Edward!

428
00:30:36,462 --> 00:30:38,672
Hi.

429
00:30:38,673 --> 00:30:41,174
Well, good morning.

430
00:30:41,175 --> 00:30:43,176
Red.

431
00:30:43,177 --> 00:30:46,054
Better.

432
00:30:47,973 --> 00:30:50,308
Y- You didn't wake me.
I can see you're really busy.

433
00:30:50,309 --> 00:30:53,728
- I'm gonna be outta here in just a minute.
- No, there's no hurry.

434
00:30:53,729 --> 00:30:55,730
Are you hungry?
You must be.

435
00:30:55,731 --> 00:30:59,818
Why don't you sit
and have something to eat?

436
00:31:00,361 --> 00:31:04,406
I, uh, took the liberty
of ordering everything on the menu.

437
00:31:04,407 --> 00:31:06,908
I didn't know what you'd like.

438
00:31:06,909 --> 00:31:10,161
- Thanks.
- All right? Good.

439
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:16,835
- Did you sleep well?
- Yeah, too good.

440
00:31:16,836 --> 00:31:20,338
- I forgot where I was.
- Occupational hazard?

441
00:31:20,339 --> 00:31:24,426
Yeah. Did you sleep?

442
00:31:24,427 --> 00:31:28,805
Uh, yes, a little,
on the couch.

443
00:31:28,806 --> 00:31:30,849
I was, uh, working
last night.

444
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:33,309
You don't sleep,
you don't do drugs,

445
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:36,855
you don't drink,
you hardly eat.

446
00:31:36,856 --> 00:31:39,733
What do you do, Edward?
'Cause I know you're not a lawyer.

447
00:31:39,734 --> 00:31:42,318
That's right.

448
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:45,530
There are four
other chairs here.

449
00:31:45,614 --> 00:31:48,533
Oh.

450
00:31:52,288 --> 00:31:55,707
- So what do you do?
- I buy companies.

451
00:31:55,708 --> 00:31:58,043
What kind of companies?

452
00:31:58,044 --> 00:32:02,881
Uh, I buy companies that are
in financial difficulty.

453
00:32:02,882 --> 00:32:05,383
If they have problems, you must
get 'em for a bargain, huh?

454
00:32:05,384 --> 00:32:08,219
Well, the company
I'm buying this week,

455
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:11,973
I'm getting for the bargain
price of about one billion.

456
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,977
- A billion dollars?
- Yes.

457
00:32:15,978 --> 00:32:18,646
Wow. You must be
really smart, huh?

458
00:32:21,108 --> 00:32:23,234
I only got through
the eleventh grade.

459
00:32:23,235 --> 00:32:27,072
How far did you go
in school?

460
00:32:27,073 --> 00:32:30,700
I went all the way.

461
00:32:32,411 --> 00:32:36,539
Your folks must be
really proud, huh?

462
00:32:42,421 --> 00:32:47,092
So you don't actually
have a billion dollars, huh?

463
00:32:47,093 --> 00:32:50,845
No, I get some of it
from banks, investors.

464
00:32:50,846 --> 00:32:53,348
It's not an easy thing to do.

465
00:32:53,349 --> 00:32:56,143
And you don't make anything
and you don't build anything.

466
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,100
No. No.

467
00:32:57,144 --> 00:32:58,921
So what do you do with the companies
once you buy them?

468
00:32:59,044 --> 00:33:00,021
I sell them.

469
00:33:00,122 --> 00:33:03,066
Here, let me do that.
You sell them.

470
00:33:03,067 --> 00:33:06,653
Well, I... don't sell the whole company;
I break it up into pieces...

471
00:33:06,654 --> 00:33:09,155
and then I sell that off;
it's worth more than the whole.

472
00:33:09,156 --> 00:33:14,619
So it's sort of like, um, stealing cars
and selling 'em for the parts, right?

473
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:18,456
- Yeah, sort of. But legal.
- Mm-hmm.

474
00:33:18,457 --> 00:33:20,792
There. See, now it's perfect.

475
00:33:20,793 --> 00:33:24,754
Not bad. Not bad at all.
Where'd you learn to do that?

476
00:33:24,755 --> 00:33:28,967
Well, I screwed the debate team
in high school.

477
00:33:28,968 --> 00:33:34,305
I had a grandpa! He was nice to me.
He liked ties on Sundays.

478
00:33:34,306 --> 00:33:37,142
Mind if I, um, take a swim
in your tub before I go?

479
00:33:37,143 --> 00:33:41,563
Not at all. Just stay
in the shallow end.

480
00:33:42,857 --> 00:33:45,567
Edward, it's Phil.
Listen, I'm running out the door.

481
00:33:45,568 --> 00:33:47,819
I just wanted to let you know,
Morse is all set for tonight.

482
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,821
- Oh, that's good.
- He's bringing his grandson.

483
00:33:49,822 --> 00:33:52,073
He's grooming him
to take over. I don't know.

484
00:33:52,074 --> 00:33:56,870
Ah, yes. Very intense young man
named David. He plays polo.

485
00:33:56,871 --> 00:34:00,290
Look, I gotta say this again.
I don't like you goin' alone.

486
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:03,376
I just want your extra time and your

487
00:34:03,377 --> 00:34:07,047
Look, I just think it'd be better
if you- if you went with a date.

488
00:34:07,048 --> 00:34:10,383
You know? Keep it social.

489
00:34:10,384 --> 00:34:13,887
- Edward? Did you hear me?
- Oh, yes. Yeah, I'm here.

490
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:16,473
- If you want to impress me
- What is that?

491
00:34:16,474 --> 00:34:18,475
- Oh
- Housekeeping is singing.

492
00:34:18,476 --> 00:34:21,603
Got to be
too flirty, Mama

493
00:34:21,604 --> 00:34:24,856
- I know how to undress me
- Yeah... listen.

494
00:34:24,857 --> 00:34:28,360
- Edward, I know a lot of nice girls.
- No, you don't.

495
00:34:28,361 --> 00:34:32,322
I just want your extra time
and your

496
00:34:32,323 --> 00:34:34,949
Kiss

497
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:39,704
- Besides, I already have one.
- If you want to impress me

498
00:34:39,705 --> 00:34:44,250
You just concentrate on finding out
what Morse is up to. I'm on my way.

499
00:34:44,251 --> 00:34:49,214
I know how to undress me
Mm-hmm, yeah, baby

500
00:34:49,215 --> 00:34:53,301
I want to be your fantasy

501
00:34:53,302 --> 00:34:56,429
Well, maybe
you could be mine

502
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:59,140
Mm-hmm
You just leave it

503
00:34:59,141 --> 00:35:02,727
All up to me

504
00:35:02,728 --> 00:35:06,231
Don't you just love Prince?

505
00:35:06,232 --> 00:35:09,484
- More than life itself.
- Don't you knock?

506
00:35:09,485 --> 00:35:12,904
Vivian, I have a business
proposition for you.

507
00:35:12,905 --> 00:35:15,740
- What do you want?
- I'm gonna be in town until Sunday.

508
00:35:15,741 --> 00:35:18,827
I'd like you to spend
the week with me.

509
00:35:19,787 --> 00:35:22,580
- Really?
- Yes.

510
00:35:22,581 --> 00:35:25,083
Yes, I'd like to hire you
as an employee.

511
00:35:25,084 --> 00:35:29,921
- Would you consider spending
the week with me?

512
00:35:29,922 --> 00:35:33,842
I will pay you
to be at my beck and call.

513
00:35:33,843 --> 00:35:36,302
Look, I'd love to be your
"beck and call girl,"

514
00:35:36,303 --> 00:35:39,139
but you're a rich,
good-lookin' guy.

515
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,558
You could get
a million girls free.

516
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:43,935
I want a professional.

517
00:35:43,936 --> 00:35:48,356
I don't need any romantic
hassles this week.

518
00:35:48,899 --> 00:35:51,860
If you're talkin' 24 hours
a day, it's gonna cost you.

519
00:35:51,861 --> 00:35:55,030
Oh, yes, of course!

520
00:35:55,031 --> 00:35:57,574
All right, here we go.

521
00:35:57,575 --> 00:35:59,784
Give me a ballpark figure.
How much?

522
00:35:59,785 --> 00:36:04,497
Six full nights, days too.

523
00:36:04,498 --> 00:36:08,960
- Four thousand.
- Six nights at 300 is 1,800.

524
00:36:08,961 --> 00:36:11,463
- You want days too.
- Two thousand.

525
00:36:11,464 --> 00:36:13,631
- Three thousand.
- Done.

526
00:36:13,632 --> 00:36:19,429
Holy shit!

527
00:36:19,889 --> 00:36:21,931
Vivian.

528
00:36:21,932 --> 00:36:25,226
Vivian, is that a yes?

529
00:36:27,229 --> 00:36:31,358
Yes.
Yes!

530
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:34,778
I'll be gone most of the day.
I want you to buy some clothes.

531
00:36:34,779 --> 00:36:37,864
- You really should think about traveler's checks.
- We may be going out evenings.

532
00:36:37,865 --> 00:36:40,700
- You'll need something to wear.
- Like what?

533
00:36:40,701 --> 00:36:44,037
Uh, nothing too flashy.
Not too sexy.

534
00:36:44,038 --> 00:36:47,499
- Conservative. You understand?
- Boring.

535
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,335
Elegant. Any questions?

536
00:36:50,336 --> 00:36:53,505
- Can I call you Eddie?
- Not if you expect me to answer.

537
00:36:53,506 --> 00:36:56,841
I would've stayed for 2,000.

538
00:36:56,842 --> 00:36:59,594
I would've paid four.

539
00:36:59,595 --> 00:37:01,680
- I'll see you tonight.
- Baby, I'm gonna treat you so nice,

540
00:37:01,681 --> 00:37:05,517
you're never gonna
wanna let me go.

541
00:37:06,352 --> 00:37:11,981
Three thousand for six days.
And, Vivian, I will let you go.

542
00:37:15,194 --> 00:37:18,697
But I'm here now.

543
00:37:28,874 --> 00:37:33,920
Three thousand dollars!

544
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:39,551
Ooh.

545
00:37:43,556 --> 00:37:45,598
Hello?

546
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,143
I called and called.
Where were you last night?

547
00:37:48,144 --> 00:37:50,228
- Ma?
- It's Viv.

548
00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:52,897
Oh. Hi. I had to party.
Where are you?

549
00:37:52,898 --> 00:37:55,483
Oh, man. Are you ready
for this? The guy?

550
00:37:55,484 --> 00:37:59,070
The Lotus? I am in his hotel room
in Beverly Hills.

551
00:37:59,071 --> 00:38:02,574
The penthouse. His bathroom is bigger
than the Blue Banana!

552
00:38:02,575 --> 00:38:04,784
Do I have to hear this?

553
00:38:04,785 --> 00:38:07,996
Kit, he wants me to stay the whole week.
And you know what he's gonna give me?

554
00:38:07,997 --> 00:38:10,040
Guess. You'll never guess.

555
00:38:10,041 --> 00:38:12,917
- Three thousand dollars.
- Bullshit!

556
00:38:12,918 --> 00:38:15,503
I swear to God.
And extra money to buy clothes.

557
00:38:15,504 --> 00:38:19,215
Oh, man! I am bummed.
I gave that guy to you!

558
00:38:19,216 --> 00:38:21,801
Three thousand. Really?
Is he twisted?

559
00:38:21,802 --> 00:38:24,512
- No. - Ugly? -
He's good-looking!

560
00:38:24,513 --> 00:38:26,681
- Well, what's wrong with him?
- Nothing.

561
00:38:26,682 --> 00:38:30,352
- Did he give you the money yet? - At the end
of the week. - That's what's wrong with him.

562
00:38:30,353 --> 00:38:33,229
Well, he gave me 300
for last night. And, Kit?

563
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:36,191
I'm gonna leave some at the front desk
for you. I want you to pick it up.

564
00:38:36,192 --> 00:38:40,236
I'm at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
Write it down.

565
00:38:40,237 --> 00:38:43,490
Are you writing it down?
You'll forget it. Write it down.

566
00:38:43,491 --> 00:38:47,327
Reg... Bev... Wil.

567
00:38:47,328 --> 00:38:51,039
Now, one more thing. Where do I go
for the clothes? Good stuff, on him.

568
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,041
- In Beverly Hills?
- Yeah.

569
00:38:53,042 --> 00:38:55,460
Rodeo Drive, baby.

570
00:38:59,965 --> 00:39:02,050
- Hi.
- Yes, ma'am. May I help you?

571
00:39:02,051 --> 00:39:05,929
Yeah, I'm leaving this here for
Kit De Luca. She's gonna pick it up.

572
00:39:06,013 --> 00:39:08,014
- Don't open that.
- No, ma'am.

573
00:39:11,727 --> 00:39:14,646
- Grazie.
- Arrivederci.

574
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,401
Miss Wilson,
do you know that lady?

575
00:39:19,402 --> 00:39:21,569
No, sir.

576
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:23,780
Wild women do

577
00:39:23,781 --> 00:39:28,535
And they don't regret it

578
00:39:29,286 --> 00:39:34,916
Wild women show
what they're goin' through

579
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:37,210
Ooh

580
00:39:37,211 --> 00:39:44,126
Wild women do what you think you'll never

581
00:39:44,802 --> 00:39:51,099
What you only dream about
wild women do

582
00:39:51,809 --> 00:39:55,562
Oh, yes, they do

583
00:39:57,148 --> 00:40:00,233
You tell me you
want a woman who

584
00:40:00,234 --> 00:40:04,112
Is simple as a flower

585
00:40:05,072 --> 00:40:07,574
Well, if you want me
to act like that

586
00:40:07,575 --> 00:40:11,953
You've got to pay me
by the hour

587
00:40:12,538 --> 00:40:19,127
Wild women do
and they don't regret it

588
00:40:19,211 --> 00:40:22,464
Oh, wild women show

589
00:40:22,465 --> 00:40:28,136
What they're goin' through
Ooh, yeah

590
00:40:28,137 --> 00:40:31,806
Wild women do
what you think you'll never

591
00:40:31,807 --> 00:40:35,643
- May I help you?
- I'm just checkin' things out.

592
00:40:35,644 --> 00:40:37,979
Are you looking for something
in particular?

593
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:42,692
No. Well, yeah.
Something... conservative.

594
00:40:42,693 --> 00:40:45,654
Yes.

595
00:40:47,448 --> 00:40:49,491
- You got nice stuff.
- Thank you.

596
00:40:49,492 --> 00:40:52,827
- How much is this?
- I don't think this would fit you.

597
00:40:52,828 --> 00:40:57,082
Well, I didn't ask if it would fit.
I asked how much it was.

598
00:40:57,083 --> 00:40:59,084
How much is this, Marie?

599
00:40:59,085 --> 00:41:01,461
It's very expensive.

600
00:41:01,462 --> 00:41:05,799
- It's very expensive.
- Look, I got money to spend in here.

601
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,677
I don't think
we have anything for you.

602
00:41:08,678 --> 00:41:10,679
You're obviously
in the wrong place.

603
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,973
Please leave.

604
00:41:28,364 --> 00:41:32,951
Doctor's office?
Two blocks down and to your left.

605
00:41:32,952 --> 00:41:35,870
Thank you.

606
00:41:41,293 --> 00:41:44,587
Tiffany is taking the corner
space; they like the project.

607
00:41:44,588 --> 00:41:46,923
We're very excited
about the whole thing.

608
00:41:46,924 --> 00:41:49,300
Did you realize that Via Rodeo
is the first new street...

609
00:41:49,301 --> 00:41:53,013
in Beverly Hills in 75 years?

610
00:41:53,597 --> 00:41:56,516
- Excuse me, miss, may I help you?
- I'm going to my room.

611
00:41:56,517 --> 00:42:00,103
- Uh, do you have a key?
- Oh. I forgot that cardboard thing.

612
00:42:00,104 --> 00:42:02,772
- I'm on the top floor.
- You're a guest here?

613
00:42:02,773 --> 00:42:05,900
- I'm with a friend.
- And who would that be?

614
00:42:05,901 --> 00:42:08,236
- Edward.
- Edward?

615
00:42:08,237 --> 00:42:11,823
Edward... Edward, uh-

616
00:42:11,949 --> 00:42:16,077
- He knows me.
- Dennis.

617
00:42:16,078 --> 00:42:19,039
Dennis, did you just come
off the night shift? Hmm?

618
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,624
- Yes, sir.
- Do you know this young lady?

619
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:24,252
- She's with Mr. Lewis.
- Mr. Lewis.

620
00:42:24,253 --> 00:42:27,130
That's it. Edward Lewis!
Thanks, Dennis.

621
00:42:27,131 --> 00:42:30,884
- Evidently she joined him last night.
- Thank you.

622
00:42:31,427 --> 00:42:34,512
Oh, God! What now? What? What?

623
00:42:34,513 --> 00:42:36,848
- What is with everybody today?
- No, no. It's all right. Just come with me.

624
00:42:36,849 --> 00:42:38,600
We'll have a little chat.
Thank you. Dennis, thank you.

625
00:42:38,649 --> 00:42:39,300
I'm coming.

626
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,395
- Uh, what is your name, miss?
- What do you want it to be?

627
00:42:42,396 --> 00:42:45,649
- Don't play with me, young lady.
- Vivian.

628
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:47,942
Thank you. Vivian.

629
00:42:47,943 --> 00:42:51,112
Well, Miss Vivian.

630
00:42:51,113 --> 00:42:55,617
Things that go on in other hotels don't
happen at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.

631
00:42:55,618 --> 00:42:58,495
Now, Mr. Lewis, however,
is a very special customer,

632
00:42:58,496 --> 00:43:01,623
and we like to think of our
special customers as friends.

633
00:43:01,624 --> 00:43:06,461
Now, as a customer, we would expect Mr.
Lewis to sign in any additional guests,

634
00:43:06,462 --> 00:43:08,797
but as a friend,
we're willing to overlook it.

635
00:43:08,798 --> 00:43:12,884
Now, I'm assuming
that you're a-

636
00:43:13,094 --> 00:43:15,970
- Relative?
- Yes.

637
00:43:15,971 --> 00:43:20,809
I thought so.
Then you must be his-

638
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:23,311
Niece?

639
00:43:23,312 --> 00:43:29,859
Of course. Naturally, when Mr. Lewis
leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again.

640
00:43:30,277 --> 00:43:33,989
I assume you have
no other uncles here.

641
00:43:34,907 --> 00:43:37,450
Good! Then we understand each other.
I would also encourage you...

642
00:43:37,451 --> 00:43:40,412
to dress a little more
appropriately; that'll be all.

643
00:43:40,413 --> 00:43:43,164
No, that's not all. That's what
I was trying to do. I tried to go...

644
00:43:43,165 --> 00:43:46,126
get a dress on Rodeo Drive today,
and the women wouldn't help me.

645
00:43:46,127 --> 00:43:48,294
And I have all this money
now and no dress!

646
00:43:48,295 --> 00:43:51,089
Not that I expect you to help me,
but I have all of this, okay?

647
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:53,466
I have to buy a dress
for dinner tonight.

648
00:43:53,467 --> 00:43:57,137
And nobody will help me.

649
00:44:08,524 --> 00:44:10,608
Oh, man, if you're
callin' the cops.

650
00:44:10,609 --> 00:44:14,446
Yeah, call the cops.
That's great. Tell 'em I said hi.

651
00:44:14,447 --> 00:44:16,698
Women's clothing.

652
00:44:16,699 --> 00:44:19,784
Bridget, please.

653
00:44:27,626 --> 00:44:33,506
Yes, Bridget. Hello. This is Barnard
Thompson here at the Regent Beverly Wil-

654
00:44:33,507 --> 00:44:38,303
Thank you, yes, but I'd
like you to do a favor for me, please.

655
00:44:38,304 --> 00:44:40,722
I'm sending someone over.
Her name is Vivian.

656
00:44:40,723 --> 00:44:42,891
She's a special guest.

657
00:44:42,892 --> 00:44:47,687
She's the niece
of a very special guest.

658
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:50,607
Now, this is the jewel in Morse's crown:

659
00:44:50,608 --> 00:44:53,610
prime industrial property straddling
the port of Long Beach and Los Angeles.

660
00:44:53,611 --> 00:44:57,447
The real estate possibilities are endless,
but most of the yard we'll just level.

661
00:44:57,448 --> 00:45:00,283
We just got the information,
Mr. Stuckey.

662
00:45:00,284 --> 00:45:04,204
Edward, we just got the Morse update.
Don, can you hold the projection, please?

663
00:45:04,205 --> 00:45:06,998
Yeah, what? Speak.

664
00:45:06,999 --> 00:45:12,253
Old Man Morse just got the inside track
on a $350 million contract...

665
00:45:12,254 --> 00:45:14,339
to build destroyers for the Navy.

666
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,341
Navy contract.
I can't believe this.

667
00:45:16,342 --> 00:45:18,845
You said they had nothing
in the hopper on this one!

668
00:45:19,042 --> 00:45:20,345
I thought they didn't.

669
00:45:20,346 --> 00:45:22,347
Hey, you know, if that's true
it could cost a lot more.

670
00:45:22,348 --> 00:45:24,349
Those stocks could go
through the roof.

671
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:25,645
Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.

672
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:28,645
Maybe we're lucky
to get this information now, sir.

673
00:45:28,646 --> 00:45:31,272
- See, we can still walk away from it.
- Walk away?

674
00:45:31,273 --> 00:45:33,316
Hey, forget it, pal. We got
a thousand man-hours in on this!

675
00:45:33,317 --> 00:45:35,819
- Nobody's walkin' away from anything!
- Philip, I think he's right.

676
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:38,279
Gentlemen, relax!

677
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:42,617
Relax! Who do we know on
the Senate Appropriations Committee?

678
00:45:42,618 --> 00:45:44,786
Senator Adams.

679
00:45:44,787 --> 00:45:46,830
All right, Senator Adams.
Let's find out where he is.

680
00:45:46,831 --> 00:45:51,710
The Navy's not gonna spend $350 million on
anything without going to Appropriations first.

681
00:45:51,711 --> 00:45:54,004
I don't understand what's goin' on
here today, gentlemen.

682
00:45:54,005 --> 00:45:56,798
That's why I hired you,
Phil, to do my worrying for me.

683
00:45:56,799 --> 00:45:58,883
I'll be in your office. Bob, if you
want to send over the geologicals?

684
00:45:58,884 --> 00:46:01,886
- No problem. -
Thank you. - Edward.

685
00:46:01,887 --> 00:46:05,640
- Listen, everything all set for
the meeting tonight? - Mm-hmm.

686
00:46:05,641 --> 00:46:08,935
Who- Who is this girl
you're going with?

687
00:46:08,936 --> 00:46:10,937
Nobody you know.

688
00:46:10,938 --> 00:46:13,815
Yes,
Edward Lewis Enterprises. Phil Stuckey.

689
00:46:13,816 --> 00:46:15,817
Yes, I have him right here.

690
00:46:15,818 --> 00:46:18,446
Don't worry, Mrs. Rainey,
I'll call you the minute it comes in.

691
00:46:18,518 --> 00:46:19,446
Thank you.

692
00:46:19,447 --> 00:46:22,782
- Have a nice day.
- Thank you.

693
00:46:26,746 --> 00:46:29,789
Hello. You must be Vivian.
My name's Bridget.

694
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:32,584
- Yeah, hi. Barney said
you'd be nice to me.

695
00:46:32,585 --> 00:46:37,005
He's very sweet. What are your plans
while you're in town?

696
00:46:37,006 --> 00:46:39,132
- We're gonna have dinner.
- Oh, don't sit on there, dear!

697
00:46:39,133 --> 00:46:41,926
- You're gonna go out? Dinner?
- Mm-hmm.

698
00:46:41,927 --> 00:46:45,013
Well, you'll need a cocktail dress
then. Come with me.

699
00:46:45,014 --> 00:46:48,183
Now, I'm sure we're gonna find something
here that your uncle will love.

700
00:46:48,184 --> 00:46:51,811
- You're a size six, right?
- Yeah. How'd you know that?

701
00:46:51,812 --> 00:46:55,231
- Oh, that's my job.
- Bridg, he's not really my uncle.

702
00:46:55,232 --> 00:46:57,609
They never are, dear.

703
00:47:00,905 --> 00:47:02,906
Barney! Sorry, mister.

704
00:47:02,907 --> 00:47:05,158
I got a dress!

705
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:07,160
Well, I'd rather hoped
you'd be wearing it.

706
00:47:07,161 --> 00:47:09,496
Oh, no, I didn't want to get it messed
up! Listen, I got shoes too. You wanna see?

707
00:47:09,497 --> 00:47:12,207
No, that won't be necessary. I'm
sure they're quite lovely. Thank you.

708
00:47:12,208 --> 00:47:14,417
Okay, well, listen. I didn't mean to
interrupt you, but Bridget was really great...

709
00:47:14,418 --> 00:47:16,419
and I just wanted
to say thanks.

710
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:20,131
- You're cool.
- You're welcome, Miss Vivian.

711
00:47:25,262 --> 00:47:27,263
Hello?

712
00:47:27,264 --> 00:47:29,474
Never, ever pick up the phone.

713
00:47:29,475 --> 00:47:32,811
- Then why are you calling me?
- Did you buy clothes today?

714
00:47:32,812 --> 00:47:35,355
- I got a dress. A cocktail one.
- That's good.

715
00:47:35,356 --> 00:47:37,607
I'll be in the hotel lobby,
7:45 sharp.

716
00:47:37,608 --> 00:47:39,609
What? You're not comin'
up to the door?

717
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:41,611
This isn't a date.
It's business.

718
00:47:41,612 --> 00:47:43,738
Where are you takin' me,
anyway?

719
00:47:43,739 --> 00:47:45,907
I'm taking you to a restaurant
called the Voltaire.

720
00:47:45,908 --> 00:47:48,368
- Very elegant.
- All right.

721
00:47:48,369 --> 00:47:51,496
I'll meet you in the lobby, but
only 'cause you're payin' me to.

722
00:47:51,497 --> 00:47:54,791
Well, thank you very much.

723
00:47:56,168 --> 00:47:59,004
Get her back for me,
please.

724
00:47:59,005 --> 00:48:00,526
Mr. Stuckey wanted to see you.

725
00:48:00,705 --> 00:48:04,926
Yes, tell him I'm in the middle
of a very important phone call.

726
00:48:04,927 --> 00:48:07,345
Hello?

727
00:48:07,346 --> 00:48:11,057
- I told you not to pick up the phone.
- Then stop callin' me.

728
00:48:11,058 --> 00:48:16,646
Sick.

729
00:48:17,273 --> 00:48:20,900
- Barney!
- It didn't fit.

730
00:48:20,901 --> 00:48:24,904
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Uh- I've got a little problem.

731
00:48:24,905 --> 00:48:26,906
All right, Miss Vivian,
one more time.

732
00:48:26,907 --> 00:48:31,202
- Dinner napkin.
- Dinner napkin, laid gently in the lap.

733
00:48:31,203 --> 00:48:35,665
Good. Elbows off the table.
Don't slouch.

734
00:48:35,666 --> 00:48:38,043
Shrimp fork,

735
00:48:38,044 --> 00:48:41,004
salad fork, dinner fork.

736
00:48:41,005 --> 00:48:43,006
I definitely have
the salad fork.

737
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:45,842
The rest of the silverware
is a little confusing.

738
00:48:45,843 --> 00:48:48,345
All right, if you get nervous,
just count the tines.

739
00:48:48,346 --> 00:48:50,680
Four tines: dinner fork.

740
00:48:50,681 --> 00:48:56,853
And sometimes there are three tines
in the salad fork. And sometimes-

741
00:49:09,241 --> 00:49:12,369
Pardon me, Mr. Lewis. I'm Mr. Thompson.
I'm the manager of the hotel.

742
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:14,704
- Uh-huh. Excuse me, I just want
to make one call. - Yes, um, sir.

743
00:49:14,705 --> 00:49:17,332
- I have a message for you, sir.
- From who?

744
00:49:17,333 --> 00:49:20,543
- From your niece, sir.
- My what?

745
00:49:20,544 --> 00:49:23,129
The young lady who's staying
with you in your room, sir.

746
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:26,883
Oh. Hmm.

747
00:49:26,884 --> 00:49:30,053
- I think we both know that she's not my niece.
- Of course.

748
00:49:30,054 --> 00:49:32,597
The reason I know that is
that I am an only child.

749
00:49:32,598 --> 00:49:35,725
- Yes, sir.
- What's the message?

750
00:49:35,726 --> 00:49:37,727
She's waiting for you
in the lounge.

751
00:49:37,728 --> 00:49:42,190
Intriguing young lady,
Miss Vivian.

752
00:49:42,191 --> 00:49:46,111
- Intriguing.
- Have a good evening, sir.

753
00:49:46,112 --> 00:49:51,950
- Thank you, Mr. -? - Thompson. I'm
the manager- manager of the hotel, sir.

754
00:50:28,362 --> 00:50:30,363
You're late.

755
00:50:30,364 --> 00:50:32,449
You're stunning.

756
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:35,785
You're forgiven.

757
00:50:36,412 --> 00:50:39,873
Shall we go to dinner?

758
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:56,014
- This way, Mr. Lewis. Your party is waiting.
- Stop fidgeting.

759
00:50:58,225 --> 00:51:02,103
- Mr. Morse.
- Yes, Mr. Lewis. I'm Jim Morse.

760
00:51:02,104 --> 00:51:06,733
This fireball is my grandson,
David.

761
00:51:06,734 --> 00:51:09,277
Well, I don't know about the fireball
part, but grandson is true enough.

762
00:51:09,278 --> 00:51:12,238
I'm pleased to meet you both.
This is a friend of mine, Vivian Ward.

763
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:16,326
- Hi. I'm really glad to meet you.
- Mr. Morse. David.

764
00:51:16,327 --> 00:51:19,245
Please, sit.

765
00:51:23,501 --> 00:51:26,419
Excuse me.

766
00:51:27,338 --> 00:51:31,925
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the ladies' room.

767
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:36,971
- Upstairs, to the right.
- Okay. Excuse me.

768
00:51:37,056 --> 00:51:41,184
- Shall I order for you?
- Yeah.

769
00:51:41,185 --> 00:51:43,186
Please do so. Thank you.

770
00:51:43,187 --> 00:51:46,147
I'll do that.

771
00:51:52,363 --> 00:51:55,031
Mr. Lewis, my grandfather believes
the men who create a company...

772
00:51:55,032 --> 00:51:58,827
- should control its destiny.
- Where's the salad?

773
00:51:59,704 --> 00:52:02,414
Uh, the salad comes
at the end of the meal.

774
00:52:02,415 --> 00:52:05,875
That's the fork I knew.

775
00:52:05,876 --> 00:52:08,712
Let me, uh, put it another way.

776
00:52:08,713 --> 00:52:12,090
Between your public statements and the
rumors flying around on this thing,

777
00:52:12,091 --> 00:52:14,968
we find it very hard to figure out what
your real intentions are.

778
00:52:14,969 --> 00:52:18,888
I don't know about you, but I've never
been able to figure which goes with what!

779
00:52:35,156 --> 00:52:37,991
You know, there was a time when
we built ships the size of cities.

780
00:52:37,992 --> 00:52:41,286
- Men like my grandfather made this country.
- Who ordered this?

781
00:52:41,287 --> 00:52:43,538
The gentleman did, ma'am. Bon appetite.

782
00:52:43,539 --> 00:52:47,334
These are escargot. It's French
for snails. It's a delicacy.

783
00:52:47,335 --> 00:52:50,337
Try it. David?

784
00:52:50,338 --> 00:52:54,716
Mr. Lewis, if you were to get control-
and I don't think you will- but if you did,

785
00:52:54,717 --> 00:52:57,677
what do you plan to do
with the company?

786
00:52:57,678 --> 00:52:59,804
Break it up
and sell off the pieces.

787
00:52:59,805 --> 00:53:02,849
I'm sure you'll understand
I'm not thrilled at the idea...

788
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:07,520
of your turning 40 years of my work
into your garage sale.

789
00:53:07,521 --> 00:53:10,732
At the price I'm paying for this stock, Mr.
Morse, you are going to be a very rich man.

790
00:53:10,733 --> 00:53:16,071
I'm rich enough. I just want
to head my shipyard.

791
00:53:17,657 --> 00:53:21,493
Slippery little suckers.

792
00:53:22,578 --> 00:53:26,331
It happens all the time.

793
00:53:26,874 --> 00:53:29,918
I met your father.
What's his name?

794
00:53:29,919 --> 00:53:34,714
- Carter.
- Yeah. Carter. Carter Lewis.

795
00:53:34,715 --> 00:53:37,300
He's not quite the bastard
everybody says he is.

796
00:53:37,301 --> 00:53:40,720
- No, I have the franchise on that.
- Does that make him proud?

797
00:53:40,721 --> 00:53:45,558
I doubt it. It doesn't
really matter now. He passed away.

798
00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:48,228
Oh, I hadn't heard.
I'm sorry.

799
00:53:48,229 --> 00:53:50,230
I'm sorry too.

800
00:53:50,231 --> 00:53:54,067
Mr. Morse, you asked for this meeting.
What can I do for you?

801
00:53:54,068 --> 00:53:59,072
- Leave my company alone.
- I can't do that. I own ten million shares.

802
00:53:59,073 --> 00:54:02,075
- I'll buy your stock back.
- You don't have the money.

803
00:54:02,076 --> 00:54:04,744
We will; we're getting a contract
to build ten destroyers.

804
00:54:04,745 --> 00:54:08,206
There will be no contract. The contract
is now buried in Appropriations Committee.

805
00:54:08,207 --> 00:54:11,751
- And it will remain there.
- And how the hell did you pull something like that?

806
00:54:11,752 --> 00:54:13,795
You got dirty politicians in
your pockets now or something?

807
00:54:13,796 --> 00:54:16,297
Easy, easy,
calm down. Calm down, David.

808
00:54:16,298 --> 00:54:20,510
- Mr. Lewis plays hardball.
- Yes, yes, I do.

809
00:54:20,511 --> 00:54:24,139
I've heard enough of this. Vivian,
it was a great pleasure to meet you.

810
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:28,727
I'm sorry, Grandfather.
I've gotta get some air. Mr. Lewis.

811
00:54:28,728 --> 00:54:31,771
I'd better join my grandson.
You two enjoy your dinner.

812
00:54:31,772 --> 00:54:36,067
I'm sure it'll be delicious.
Good luck, miss.

813
00:54:36,277 --> 00:54:40,405
Watch out, Lewis.
I'm gonna tear you apart.

814
00:54:40,406 --> 00:54:43,868
I look forward to it, sir.

815
00:54:52,712 --> 00:54:54,922
Edward?

816
00:54:57,392 --> 00:54:59,811
Edward, you said you never
come out here.

817
00:54:59,894 --> 00:55:03,565
Well, I'm only halfway out.

818
00:55:03,648 --> 00:55:07,402
Didn't say much in the car
on the way home.

819
00:55:07,444 --> 00:55:11,031
You thinkin' about dinner?
I was a maniac.

820
00:55:11,114 --> 00:55:14,659
I mean, the business
was good, I think. You know?

821
00:55:14,743 --> 00:55:18,246
He's in trouble.
You want his company.

822
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:20,248
He doesn't want
to let it go.

823
00:55:20,332 --> 00:55:22,542
Thanks for the recap.

824
00:55:22,584 --> 00:55:26,421
The problem is, I think
you liked Mr. Morse.

825
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:29,716
I'd like for you to get down from there;
you're making me very nervous.

826
00:55:29,758 --> 00:55:33,178
It's making you nervous? What if I just
leaned back a little bit like this?

827
00:55:33,261 --> 00:55:35,221
Would you- Would you
rescue me if I fell?

828
00:55:35,263 --> 00:55:37,265
Vivian, I'm serious.
Come- I'm not looking.

829
00:55:37,349 --> 00:55:41,269
It's really high. Look, no hands,
no hands! Okay, all right. I'm sorry.

830
00:55:43,355 --> 00:55:49,152
The truth is, it really is totally
irrelevant whether I like this man or not.

831
00:55:49,235 --> 00:55:52,614
I will not let myself become
emotionally involved in business.

832
00:55:52,697 --> 00:55:57,410
I know.
Kit's always saying to me,

833
00:55:57,452 --> 00:55:59,579
"Don't get emotional
when you turn tricks. "

834
00:55:59,621 --> 00:56:02,499
That's why no kissing.
It's too personal.

835
00:56:02,582 --> 00:56:05,502
It's like what you're saying:
You stay numb, you don't get involved.

836
00:56:05,585 --> 00:56:08,838
When I'm with a guy,
I'm like a robot. I just do it.

837
00:56:14,344 --> 00:56:17,263
I mean... except with you.

838
00:56:17,305 --> 00:56:19,849
Oh, of course, not with me.

839
00:56:21,559 --> 00:56:25,146
You and I are such similar
creatures, Vivian.

840
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:27,482
We both screw people
for money.

841
00:56:33,697 --> 00:56:35,657
I was sorry to hear
about your dad.

842
00:56:35,699 --> 00:56:39,327
- When did he die?
- Last month.

843
00:56:41,162 --> 00:56:43,123
Do you miss him?

844
00:56:43,164 --> 00:56:48,461
I hadn't spoken to him
in fourteen and a half years.

845
00:56:50,338 --> 00:56:53,341
I wasn't there
when he died.

846
00:56:53,425 --> 00:56:56,219
- Do you want to talk about this?
- No.

847
00:56:56,302 --> 00:57:00,682
Well, I tell you what,
'cause I got an idea.

848
00:57:00,724 --> 00:57:06,021
Let's watch old movies all night.
We'll just veg out in front of the TV.

849
00:57:06,062 --> 00:57:10,900
- "Veg out"?
- Yeah. Be still like vegetables. Lay like broccoli.

850
00:57:13,528 --> 00:57:18,491
Look, I'll tell you what. I'll be back.
We'll do broccoli tomorrow.

851
00:57:19,951 --> 00:57:23,872
- Where are you going?
- I'm going downstairs for a while.

852
00:57:25,874 --> 00:57:28,084
Did you say
marriage license?

853
00:57:28,168 --> 00:57:30,670
Now, don't change the subject,
just give me the stamp.

854
00:57:30,754 --> 00:57:35,717
Oh, I love you, Adam, Alex, Peter,
Brian, whatever your name is.

855
00:57:35,759 --> 00:57:37,719
Oh, I love you.

856
00:57:49,939 --> 00:57:53,985
Hi, uh, I'm in the penthouse.
The guy that was here,

857
00:57:54,069 --> 00:57:57,697
Mr. Lewis, have you seen him
down there anywhere?

858
00:58:37,278 --> 00:58:39,280
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

859
00:58:39,322 --> 00:58:42,367
I didn't know you played.

860
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:44,369
I only play for strangers.

861
00:58:44,452 --> 00:58:48,206
I was gettin' lonely
upstairs all by myself.

862
00:58:53,712 --> 00:58:57,590
Gentlemen, would you mind
leaving us, please?

863
00:59:00,552 --> 00:59:02,470
Thank you.

864
00:59:04,472 --> 00:59:07,559
People always do
what you tell them to do?

865
00:59:38,673 --> 00:59:41,009
I guess so.

866
01:00:40,068 --> 01:00:41,987
Wake up. Time to shop.

867
01:00:44,239 --> 01:00:48,535
Now, if you have any trouble using
this card, have them call the hotel.

868
01:00:48,618 --> 01:00:51,246
All right?

869
01:00:51,287 --> 01:00:53,373
More shopping.

870
01:00:53,456 --> 01:00:55,583
Mm-hmm.

871
01:00:55,667 --> 01:00:59,838
I'm surprised you didn't
buy more than one dress yesterday.

872
01:00:59,921 --> 01:01:03,633
- Wasn't as much fun as I thought it was gonna be.
- Why not?

873
01:01:03,717 --> 01:01:06,302
They were mean to me.

874
01:01:06,386 --> 01:01:08,763
Mean to you?

875
01:01:11,099 --> 01:01:13,018
People are looking at me.

876
01:01:13,101 --> 01:01:15,729
They're not looking at you;
they're looking at me.

877
01:01:15,812 --> 01:01:18,231
The stores are not nice to people.
I don't like it.

878
01:01:18,315 --> 01:01:23,069
Stores are never nice to people;
they're nice to credit cards.

879
01:01:23,153 --> 01:01:27,032
Okay, stop fidgeting.
Get rid of your gum.

880
01:01:29,534 --> 01:01:31,703
I don't believe
you did that.

881
01:01:33,872 --> 01:01:37,625
- Yes.
- I am Mr. Hollister, the manager. May I help you?

882
01:01:37,709 --> 01:01:40,045
- Edward Lewis.
- Ah, yes, sir.

883
01:01:40,128 --> 01:01:43,673
- You see this young lady over here.
- Yes.

884
01:01:43,757 --> 01:01:47,178
Do you have anything in this shop
as beautiful as she is?

885
01:01:47,257 --> 01:01:48,178
Oh, yes.

886
01:01:48,219 --> 01:01:53,808
Oh, no! No, no, no, I'm saying we have many
things as beautiful as she would want them to be.

887
01:01:53,850 --> 01:01:56,686
That's the point I was getting at,
and I think we can all agree with that.

888
01:01:56,770 --> 01:02:01,191
- That's why when you came in- - Excuse me.
We're gonna need a few more people helping us.

889
01:02:01,232 --> 01:02:05,695
I'll tell you why. We're going to be
spending an obscene amount of money in here.

890
01:02:05,737 --> 01:02:08,657
So we're going to need
a lot more help sucking up to us.

891
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:11,159
That's what we really like.
You understand that.

892
01:02:11,242 --> 01:02:14,245
Sir, you're in the right store
and the right city for that matter.

893
01:02:14,329 --> 01:02:17,457
Anything you see here, we can do,
by the way. Get ready to have some fun.

894
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:20,168
Mary Pat, Mary Kate,
Mary Francis, Tovah, let's see it!

895
01:02:20,251 --> 01:02:22,629
- Come on. Bring it out, girls.
- Oh, this is absolutely divine.

896
01:02:22,712 --> 01:02:24,547
- Excuse me, sir, uh,
- Yeah?

897
01:02:24,631 --> 01:02:28,510
exactly how obscene an amount of money
were you talking about?

898
01:02:28,593 --> 01:02:30,845
Just profane
or really offensive?

899
01:02:30,929 --> 01:02:35,141
- Really offensive.
- I like him so much!

900
01:02:50,365 --> 01:02:53,827
Mr. Lewis, sir. Mr. Lewis, how's it
going so far? Pretty well, I think.

901
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:57,247
I think we need some
major sucking up.

902
01:02:57,330 --> 01:03:01,209
Very well, sir. You're not only
handsome, but a powerful man.

903
01:03:01,251 --> 01:03:04,045
I could see the second you walked in
here, you were someone to reckon with-

904
01:03:04,129 --> 01:03:06,047
- Hollister.
- Yes, sir.

905
01:03:06,131 --> 01:03:08,133
Not me. Her.

906
01:03:08,216 --> 01:03:10,260
I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry.

907
01:03:10,343 --> 01:03:12,262
How we doing, ladies?

908
01:03:12,345 --> 01:03:14,264
Oh, Edward, Edward.
Where the hell are you?

909
01:03:14,347 --> 01:03:17,058
The word's all over the street.
Morse is gonna raise your offer, pal.

910
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:20,603
He's countering?
God, he is a tough old bird.

911
01:03:20,687 --> 01:03:23,440
He knows the navy contracts are stalled.
Where's he gonna get the money?

912
01:03:23,523 --> 01:03:25,817
I don't know. He, uh- I think
he's throwin' in with the employees.

913
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:28,236
He still needs someone
to underwrite the paper.

914
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:31,197
- Find out who it is.
- Yeah, okay. You got it.

915
01:03:31,281 --> 01:03:35,327
You're on your own. I have to go
back to work. You look great!

916
01:03:35,410 --> 01:03:38,246
- She has my card.
- And we'll help her use it, sir.

917
01:03:41,624 --> 01:03:44,961
# Pretty woman
walking down the street #

918
01:03:45,045 --> 01:03:48,923
# Pretty woman
the kind I like to meet #

919
01:03:49,007 --> 01:03:51,593
# Pretty woman #

920
01:03:51,634 --> 01:03:55,805
# I don't believe you
You're not the truth #

921
01:03:55,889 --> 01:04:01,102
# No one could look as good as you
Mercy #

922
01:04:05,649 --> 01:04:08,026
- Edward would love that tie.
- Would you give her the tie?

923
01:04:08,109 --> 01:04:10,070
- The tie?
- Take off the tie. Give her the tie.

924
01:04:10,153 --> 01:04:12,572
- He wants to do this, by the way.
- He would go crazy about this tie.

925
01:04:12,656 --> 01:04:14,574
Who ordered pizza?

926
01:04:14,658 --> 01:04:18,078
# Pretty woman, stop a while #

927
01:04:18,161 --> 01:04:21,748
# Pretty woman, talk a while #

928
01:04:21,831 --> 01:04:27,295
# Pretty woman
give your smile to me #

929
01:04:29,339 --> 01:04:33,134
# Pretty woman
Yeah, yeah, yeah #

930
01:04:33,176 --> 01:04:36,805
# Pretty woman, look my way #

931
01:04:36,888 --> 01:04:39,307
# Pretty woman #

932
01:04:39,391 --> 01:04:41,393
- May I help you?
- No, thank you. Hi.

933
01:04:41,476 --> 01:04:43,395
- Hello.
- Do you remember me?

934
01:04:43,478 --> 01:04:46,898
- No, I'm sorry.
- I was in here yesterday. You wouldn't wait on me.

935
01:04:46,982 --> 01:04:49,651
- Oh.
- You work on commission, right?

936
01:04:49,693 --> 01:04:51,653
Uh, yes.

937
01:04:51,695 --> 01:04:54,406
Big mistake. Big. Huge!

938
01:04:54,489 --> 01:04:57,826
I have to go shopping now.

939
01:04:57,909 --> 01:05:01,329
# Pretty woman
don't walk on by #

940
01:05:01,413 --> 01:05:05,250
# Pretty woman
don't make me cry #

941
01:05:05,333 --> 01:05:08,044
# Pretty woman #

942
01:05:08,128 --> 01:05:12,757
# Don't walk away, hey #

943
01:05:16,094 --> 01:05:18,013
Thank you.

944
01:05:18,096 --> 01:05:23,310
# Oh, oh, pretty woman ##

945
01:05:23,393 --> 01:05:25,103
- Mister Lewis.
- Gentlemen.

946
01:05:25,186 --> 01:05:27,314
Fellas, let's finish this up
this afternoon, huh?

947
01:05:27,397 --> 01:05:31,484
Jake, set something up with Blair.
Around 2:00, 2:30 would be good.

948
01:05:31,568 --> 01:05:35,989
You were right about Morse. He mortgaged
everything he owns, right down to his underwear,

949
01:05:36,072 --> 01:05:38,158
to secure a loan from the bank.

950
01:05:38,241 --> 01:05:40,994
And it's not just any bank.
Plymouth Trust, huh?

951
01:05:41,077 --> 01:05:43,538
- Hmm.
- So, it goes without saying...

952
01:05:43,621 --> 01:05:45,915
that your business means a lot more
to them than our friend, Mr. Morse.

953
01:05:45,999 --> 01:05:48,418
All you gotta do
is call the bank.

954
01:05:51,921 --> 01:05:53,840
Yeah.

955
01:05:57,719 --> 01:06:02,182
Edward, excuse me for saying this, but
what the hell is wrong with you this week?

956
01:06:02,265 --> 01:06:06,227
Are you givin' Morse a chance
to get away?

957
01:06:06,311 --> 01:06:10,774
You know what I used to love
when I was a kid, Phil?

958
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:13,610
What?

959
01:06:13,693 --> 01:06:15,612
Blocks.

960
01:06:17,197 --> 01:06:19,407
Building blocks.
Erector sets.

961
01:06:19,449 --> 01:06:23,912
So, I liked Monopoly. Boardwalk,
Park Place. Wh-What's the point?

962
01:06:23,953 --> 01:06:28,166
We don't build anything, Phil.
We don't make anything.

963
01:06:28,249 --> 01:06:30,418
We make money, Edward.

964
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:33,922
We worked for a year on this deal.
It's what you said you wanted.

965
01:06:34,005 --> 01:06:36,049
I'm handing it to you.

966
01:06:36,132 --> 01:06:40,095
Morse's jugular is exposed.
It's time for the kill.

967
01:06:40,178 --> 01:06:42,263
Let's finish this.

968
01:06:42,347 --> 01:06:44,265
Call the bank!

969
01:07:05,495 --> 01:07:07,414
How was your day, dear?

970
01:07:11,001 --> 01:07:13,211
Nice tie.

971
01:07:13,294 --> 01:07:15,255
I got it for you.

972
01:07:17,590 --> 01:07:20,301
Well, my mother
was a music teacher...

973
01:07:20,385 --> 01:07:25,015
and married my father, whose
family was extremely wealthy.

974
01:07:25,098 --> 01:07:29,185
Then he divorced my mother
to be with another woman.

975
01:07:29,269 --> 01:07:31,604
And he took his money with him.

976
01:07:32,689 --> 01:07:35,108
And then she died.

977
01:07:35,191 --> 01:07:37,193
I was very angry with him.

978
01:07:37,277 --> 01:07:40,238
It cost me $10,000 in therapy
to say that sentence.

979
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:42,240
I was very angry with him.

980
01:07:42,282 --> 01:07:44,826
I do it very well, don't I? I'll say
it again. I was very angry with him.

981
01:07:44,909 --> 01:07:48,538
Hello, my name is Mr. Lewis.
I'm very angry with my father.

982
01:07:48,621 --> 01:07:52,542
I would've been angry
at the $10,000.

983
01:07:52,625 --> 01:07:58,423
My father was president
of the third company I ever took over.

984
01:07:59,841 --> 01:08:03,678
I bought it.
I sold it off piece by piece.

985
01:08:03,762 --> 01:08:07,557
- What'd the shrink say?
- He said I was cured.

986
01:08:07,641 --> 01:08:11,061
Well, so you got even.
That must've made you happy.

987
01:08:16,691 --> 01:08:20,862
Did I mention my leg
is 44 inches from hip to toe,

988
01:08:20,945 --> 01:08:26,451
so, basically, we're talkin'
about 88 inches of therapy...

989
01:08:26,493 --> 01:08:29,954
wrapped around you
for the bargain price of...

990
01:08:29,996 --> 01:08:32,749
$3,000.

991
01:08:32,832 --> 01:08:35,418
Yeah.

992
01:08:37,462 --> 01:08:40,131
Ebersol of the Falcons passes to Kennan.

993
01:08:40,173 --> 01:08:42,717
This is Bill Fricker with Gwen Olsen
giving you play-by-play...

994
01:08:42,801 --> 01:08:45,011
- of this marvelous charity event.
- Watch where you're walking.

995
01:08:45,095 --> 01:08:48,431
If you step in something,
we're not going back in the car.

996
01:08:48,515 --> 01:08:53,186
Not too near the tree. I don't like the
ants. Hello. Have you seen Edward anywhere?

997
01:08:53,269 --> 01:08:54,891
What if someone recognizes me?

998
01:08:55,069 --> 01:08:57,691
Not likely. They don't spend too much time
on Hollywood Blvd.

999
01:08:57,732 --> 01:09:01,069
- You did.
- Come on. Let go. Let go.

1000
01:09:01,152 --> 01:09:03,822
All right. You look great.
You look like a lady.

1001
01:09:03,905 --> 01:09:05,865
You're gonna
have a wonderful time.

1002
01:09:07,909 --> 01:09:11,121
Okay. Don't fidget and smile.

1003
01:09:11,204 --> 01:09:13,748
Humboldt's coming around to this side.

1004
01:09:13,832 --> 01:09:16,126
Toquenee is on Kennan.
Penalty on that play.

1005
01:09:16,209 --> 01:09:19,462
This is Gwen and Gretchen,
the infamous Olsen sisters,

1006
01:09:19,546 --> 01:09:22,090
who have made marrying well
an art form.

1007
01:09:22,173 --> 01:09:24,342
- Edward.
- Be back in just a second. Hold on.

1008
01:09:24,426 --> 01:09:27,178
So, you're the flavor
of the month. Hmm.

1009
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:31,391
Uh, she's just being testy.
Edward's our most eligible bachelor.

1010
01:09:31,474 --> 01:09:33,393
Everybody is
trying to land him.

1011
01:09:33,476 --> 01:09:38,398
Well, I'm not trying to land him.
I'm just using him for sex.

1012
01:09:38,481 --> 01:09:41,401
Oh, yes.

1013
01:09:41,484 --> 01:09:45,030
- Well done.
- Well done. Whoo, whoo, whoo!

1014
01:09:46,990 --> 01:09:49,701
Tell me again
why we're here.

1015
01:09:49,743 --> 01:09:52,120
- Business.
- Business mingling?

1016
01:09:52,203 --> 01:09:54,539
Yeah.

1017
01:09:54,581 --> 01:09:56,708
That's
the chukker, ladies and gentlemen.

1018
01:09:56,750 --> 01:09:58,710
Falcons, seven.
Gems, four.

1019
01:09:58,752 --> 01:10:02,964
- Excuse me. Edward! Edward. Over here.
- Phil.

1020
01:10:03,048 --> 01:10:04,966
- Ah, good to see you.
- You too.

1021
01:10:05,050 --> 01:10:06,968
I want you to meet
a new friend of mine, Vivian Ward.

1022
01:10:07,052 --> 01:10:09,971
Well, hi. Philip Stuckey, Vivian.
This is my wife, Elizabeth.

1023
01:10:10,055 --> 01:10:13,099
It's always a pleasure meeting
one of Edward's girls.

1024
01:10:13,183 --> 01:10:15,518
Oh, my God!
It's Tate Whitley Wallington.

1025
01:10:15,602 --> 01:10:18,772
Tate! It's me, Elizabeth,
from Workout World.

1026
01:10:20,357 --> 01:10:24,110
Sort of an aerobics queen.
Feel the burns.

1027
01:10:24,194 --> 01:10:27,238
Well, let me get you something to drink.
Vivian, why don't you start with that. Okay?

1028
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:29,908
I'll be right back. Did you notice
Senator Adams is here?

1029
01:10:29,949 --> 01:10:31,951
Mm-hmm. I asked him.

1030
01:10:32,035 --> 01:10:36,581
That is why I have pledged
my eternal love to you. Mmm!

1031
01:10:36,623 --> 01:10:40,210
Real genuine guy.
Who is he?

1032
01:10:40,293 --> 01:10:42,295
He's my lawyer.
He's all right.

1033
01:10:42,379 --> 01:10:44,297
You could freeze ice
on his wife's ass.

1034
01:10:44,381 --> 01:10:46,299
Maybe we'll try that later.

1035
01:10:46,383 --> 01:10:49,928
- Are these people your friends?
- I spend time with them, yeah.

1036
01:10:50,011 --> 01:10:53,723
- Well, no wonder.
- No wonder what?

1037
01:10:53,807 --> 01:10:56,768
No wonder why
you came looking for me.

1038
01:10:56,810 --> 01:11:00,021
And I do need some help from you
ladies and gentlemen in the audience.

1039
01:11:00,105 --> 01:11:03,942
We need you to help replace some of
the divots out here on the grass.

1040
01:11:03,984 --> 01:11:06,820
- So come on out now.
Come on! Come on, folks.

1041
01:11:06,903 --> 01:11:09,280
You heard her.
The stomping of the divots.

1042
01:11:09,322 --> 01:11:11,992
This is a time-honored tradition,
ladies and gentlemen.

1043
01:11:12,075 --> 01:11:17,038
As old as the game of polo itself.
Kings and queens used to do this.

1044
01:11:18,581 --> 01:11:20,959
She's sweet, Edward.

1045
01:11:21,001 --> 01:11:23,253
Wherever did you find her?

1046
01:11:23,336 --> 01:11:26,047
976-BABE.

1047
01:11:28,591 --> 01:11:33,596
Only one word of advice:
Avoid the steaming divot!

1048
01:11:39,936 --> 01:11:42,772
No, it's all part
of the game of polo.

1049
01:11:42,856 --> 01:11:45,233
You get to have your shoes
polished by a member of the club.

1050
01:11:45,317 --> 01:11:47,235
I think I got something in the car
that will buff that up.

1051
01:11:47,319 --> 01:11:49,237
Thank you.

1052
01:11:49,321 --> 01:11:54,034
- Vivian, hi. David Morse.
- Excuse me.

1053
01:11:54,117 --> 01:11:56,036
- David.
- How are ya?

1054
01:11:56,119 --> 01:11:58,663
- I'm okay.
- I thought that was you. I like this hat.

1055
01:11:58,747 --> 01:12:01,609
- It's new. Yeah?
- Yeah. Thanks.

1056
01:12:01,723 --> 01:12:05,060
- Come meet my horse, Vivian.
- Well, Edward's waiting for me.

1057
01:12:05,143 --> 01:12:08,021
- He's right here.
- Okay, I'll- Just for a second, though.

1058
01:12:08,063 --> 01:12:09,981
I didn't know
you were playing today.

1059
01:12:10,065 --> 01:12:13,485
Uh, I was asking for directions.
There she was.

1060
01:12:13,568 --> 01:12:16,279
Oh, so you just ran into her?
That's great. Jesus.

1061
01:12:16,363 --> 01:12:20,617
So anyway, what does she do?
Does she work?

1062
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:23,828
- She's in sales.
- Sales? That's terrific. That's good.

1063
01:12:23,912 --> 01:12:25,830
What does she sell?

1064
01:12:27,332 --> 01:12:29,250
Why do you want to know?

1065
01:12:30,919 --> 01:12:33,838
Just hear me out on this.
I've known you a long time.

1066
01:12:33,922 --> 01:12:38,677
I see some differences in you this week,
like the tie, and, uh-

1067
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:41,096
I'm wondering if maybe
this girl isn't the difference,

1068
01:12:41,137 --> 01:12:44,432
especially when I see her
talking to David Morse.

1069
01:12:48,144 --> 01:12:50,814
- I introduced them at dinner the other night.
- So what?

1070
01:12:50,897 --> 01:12:53,817
Now they're best friends?
This girl appears out of nowhere.

1071
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:57,237
Now she's talking to a guy whose company we're
trying to buy. Convenient, don't you think?

1072
01:12:57,278 --> 01:13:00,198
- Don't be ridiculous.
- How do you know that this girl...

1073
01:13:00,281 --> 01:13:03,201
hasn't attached herself to you because
she's bringing information back to Morse?

1074
01:13:03,284 --> 01:13:05,578
- This happens! Industrial espionage-
- Phil, Phil, Phil!

1075
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:07,789
- Phil, listen to me.
- What?

1076
01:13:07,872 --> 01:13:11,876
- She's not a spy. She is a hooker.
- Oh!

1077
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:13,878
She is a hooker.

1078
01:13:15,672 --> 01:13:18,008
I picked her up
on Hollywood Boulevard.

1079
01:13:18,091 --> 01:13:20,010
In your car.

1080
01:13:24,472 --> 01:13:26,599
- Oh, you are-
- Yes, yes.

1081
01:13:26,641 --> 01:13:28,810
Oh, man!

1082
01:13:28,893 --> 01:13:31,980
You're the only millionaire
I ever heard of...

1083
01:13:32,063 --> 01:13:35,775
who goes looking for a bargain basement
streetwalker, you know?

1084
01:13:35,859 --> 01:13:38,320
- Edward!
- I'm sorry I told you.

1085
01:13:38,361 --> 01:13:42,073
Senator. Senator Adams,
I'm pleased you could make it.

1086
01:13:42,157 --> 01:13:44,576
Thank you. I hope the information
I gave you was helpful.

1087
01:13:44,659 --> 01:13:47,037
Oh, absolutely, yes, and thank you
for it. There's no change, is there?

1088
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:49,164
No, it's still bogged down.

1089
01:13:52,167 --> 01:13:55,795
- Having a nice time, Vivian?
- Yeah, I'm having a great time.

1090
01:13:55,879 --> 01:13:58,798
Must be quite a change
from Hollywood Boulevard, hmm?

1091
01:14:00,508 --> 01:14:02,469
What?

1092
01:14:02,510 --> 01:14:04,512
Yeah, Edward told me.

1093
01:14:04,596 --> 01:14:08,516
But don't worry;
you're secret is safe with me.

1094
01:14:08,558 --> 01:14:12,896
Listen, maybe, uh, you and I could
get together sometime...

1095
01:14:12,979 --> 01:14:14,898
after Edward leaves.

1096
01:14:16,358 --> 01:14:18,860
Yeah, sure. Why not?

1097
01:14:19,944 --> 01:14:22,364
We'll just
have to do that, hmm?

1098
01:14:22,447 --> 01:14:24,366
Philip.

1099
01:14:26,409 --> 01:14:28,370
Hi, tailgaters.

1100
01:14:28,411 --> 01:14:30,705
I'd like to mention a couple
of our silver sponsors:

1101
01:14:30,789 --> 01:14:33,333
Jacobs Distributors,
Norrell Saddlery,

1102
01:14:33,375 --> 01:14:37,170
and we'd like to give a great big thanks
to our platinum sponsor,

1103
01:14:37,212 --> 01:14:41,049
Edward Lewis Enterprises.

1104
01:14:41,091 --> 01:14:43,927
The ball is in for chukker number four.

1105
01:14:52,602 --> 01:14:55,313
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

1106
01:14:55,355 --> 01:14:59,651
Fine. That's good.
Seven "fines" since we left the match.

1107
01:14:59,693 --> 01:15:01,653
Could I have
another word, please?

1108
01:15:01,695 --> 01:15:03,655
Asshole! There's a word.

1109
01:15:05,115 --> 01:15:07,033
I think I liked "fine" better.

1110
01:15:07,117 --> 01:15:11,413
You know what? Just tell me one thing:
Why did you make me get all dressed up?

1111
01:15:11,496 --> 01:15:13,915
Well, for one thing,
the clothing was appropriate.

1112
01:15:13,999 --> 01:15:17,752
No, what I mean is, if you
were gonna tell everybody I'm a hooker,

1113
01:15:17,836 --> 01:15:20,422
- why didn't you just let me wear my own
clothes, okay? - I did not- I did not-

1114
01:15:20,505 --> 01:15:23,466
I mean, in my own clothes, when someone
like that guy Stuckey comes up to me,

1115
01:15:23,550 --> 01:15:26,303
I can handle it;
I'm prepared.

1116
01:15:26,386 --> 01:15:31,266
I'm very sorry. I'm not happy with
Stuckey at all for saying or doing that.

1117
01:15:31,349 --> 01:15:34,436
But he is my attorney.
I've known him for ten years.

1118
01:15:34,519 --> 01:15:38,064
He thought you were some kind of
industrial spy. The guy's paranoid.

1119
01:15:38,148 --> 01:15:41,192
Are you my pimp now? You think you
can pass me around to your friends?

1120
01:15:41,276 --> 01:15:45,238
- I'm not some little toy!
- Look, I know you're not my toy. Vivian!

1121
01:15:45,322 --> 01:15:48,158
Vivian, I'm speaking to you.
Come back here!

1122
01:15:48,241 --> 01:15:50,869
I hate to point out the obvious,
but you are, in fact, a hooker!

1123
01:15:50,952 --> 01:15:53,705
- And you are my employee!
- Look, you don't own me. I decide, okay?

1124
01:15:53,747 --> 01:15:56,708
I say who; I say when;
I- I say who-

1125
01:15:56,750 --> 01:16:00,378
I refuse to spend the next three days fighting
with you. I said I was sorry. I meant it.

1126
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:03,131
That's the end of it!

1127
01:16:03,214 --> 01:16:05,133
I'm sorry I ever met you.

1128
01:16:06,801 --> 01:16:08,887
I'm sorry I ever
got into your stupid car!

1129
01:16:08,970 --> 01:16:12,057
As if you had so many more
appealing options.

1130
01:16:13,642 --> 01:16:18,605
I've never had anyone
make me feel as cheap as you did today.

1131
01:16:18,647 --> 01:16:21,691
Somehow, I find that
very hard to believe.

1132
01:16:29,115 --> 01:16:31,076
Where are you going?

1133
01:16:31,117 --> 01:16:34,579
I want my money.
I want to get out of here.

1134
01:17:20,625 --> 01:17:22,544
Come on!

1135
01:17:34,806 --> 01:17:36,725
I'm sorry.

1136
01:17:38,476 --> 01:17:42,397
I wasn't prepared
to answer questions about us.

1137
01:17:44,482 --> 01:17:47,944
It was stupid and cruel.

1138
01:17:48,028 --> 01:17:49,946
I didn't mean it.

1139
01:17:50,030 --> 01:17:53,325
I don't want you to go.

1140
01:17:53,366 --> 01:17:57,287
- Will you stay the week?
- Why?

1141
01:17:59,247 --> 01:18:04,294
I saw you talking to David Morse;
I didn't like it.

1142
01:18:04,377 --> 01:18:06,713
We were just talking.

1143
01:18:10,258 --> 01:18:12,260
I didn't like it.

1144
01:18:15,055 --> 01:18:17,599
Down?

1145
01:18:29,569 --> 01:18:31,488
You hurt me.

1146
01:18:32,739 --> 01:18:34,699
Yes.

1147
01:18:36,326 --> 01:18:38,536
Don't do it again.

1148
01:19:00,850 --> 01:19:04,938
First guy I ever loved
was a total nothing.

1149
01:19:05,021 --> 01:19:06,940
Second was worse.

1150
01:19:07,023 --> 01:19:08,942
My mom called me
a bum magnet.

1151
01:19:09,025 --> 01:19:13,697
If there was a bum within a 50-mile
radius, I was completely attracted to him.

1152
01:19:13,780 --> 01:19:17,033
That's how I ended up here.
I followed bum number three.

1153
01:19:17,117 --> 01:19:19,035
Oh.

1154
01:19:19,119 --> 01:19:22,872
So here I was: no money,
no friends, no bum.

1155
01:19:25,041 --> 01:19:28,795
And you chose this as your profession?

1156
01:19:30,463 --> 01:19:33,591
I worked at a couple
fast food places,

1157
01:19:33,675 --> 01:19:36,761
parked cars at wrestling.

1158
01:19:36,803 --> 01:19:40,724
And I couldn't make the rent.
I was too ashamed to go home.

1159
01:19:40,807 --> 01:19:42,934
That's when I met Kit.

1160
01:19:42,976 --> 01:19:45,937
She was a hooker
and made it sound so great.

1161
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:48,940
So one day I did it.

1162
01:19:50,775 --> 01:19:52,944
I cried the whole time.

1163
01:19:55,530 --> 01:19:58,283
But then I got some regulars
and, you know-

1164
01:19:58,325 --> 01:20:02,787
It's not like anybody plans this;
it's not your childhood dream.

1165
01:20:06,583 --> 01:20:09,002
You could be
so much more.

1166
01:20:11,671 --> 01:20:15,634
People put you down enough,
you start to believe it.

1167
01:20:17,594 --> 01:20:23,016
I think you are a very bright,
very special woman.

1168
01:20:24,434 --> 01:20:28,146
The bad stuff
is easier to believe.

1169
01:20:28,229 --> 01:20:30,690
You ever notice that?

1170
01:20:39,824 --> 01:20:42,744
- Tell him I'll call him on Monday.
- Yes, sir.

1171
01:20:42,827 --> 01:20:45,747
- Where you going? Did he sign these?
- No, he said he had to leave.

1172
01:20:45,830 --> 01:20:47,575
Edward, you can't disappear now.
We're in this too deep.

1173
01:20:47,730 --> 01:20:48,875
Don't panic, Philip.

1174
01:20:48,958 --> 01:20:51,419
Morse isn't going anywhere.
I'll be back here in the morning.

1175
01:20:51,503 --> 01:20:53,588
- Did you send the tickets to the hotel? Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

1176
01:20:53,672 --> 01:20:55,590
- Where are you going?
- I have a date.

1177
01:20:55,674 --> 01:20:57,592
With the hooker?

1178
01:21:01,471 --> 01:21:03,390
Be careful, Philip.

1179
01:21:24,786 --> 01:21:26,705
- Do I look okay?
- Mmm.

1180
01:21:26,788 --> 01:21:29,374
- Mmm?
- Something's missing.

1181
01:21:29,457 --> 01:21:33,461
Well, nothin' else is gonna fit
into this dress. I'll tell ya that.

1182
01:21:33,545 --> 01:21:35,463
Well, maybe
something in this box.

1183
01:21:35,547 --> 01:21:39,509
I don't want you to get too excited.
This is only on loan.

1184
01:21:45,223 --> 01:21:47,517
Oh!

1185
01:21:47,559 --> 01:21:51,021
They really let you borrow this
from the jewelry store?

1186
01:21:51,062 --> 01:21:53,732
I'm a very good customer.

1187
01:21:53,815 --> 01:21:56,067
If you were gonna buy this,
how much would it cost?

1188
01:21:56,151 --> 01:21:58,862
Quarter of a million.

1189
01:21:58,945 --> 01:22:00,905
A quarter
of a million dollars?

1190
01:22:06,578 --> 01:22:08,913
So, where we goin'?

1191
01:22:08,955 --> 01:22:10,915
It's a surprise.

1192
01:22:13,293 --> 01:22:17,756
If I forget to tell you later,
I had a really good time tonight.

1193
01:22:17,797 --> 01:22:19,549
Thank you.

1194
01:22:39,194 --> 01:22:41,988
When you're not fidgeting,
you look very beautiful...

1195
01:22:42,072 --> 01:22:43,948
and very tall.

1196
01:22:44,032 --> 01:22:48,328
# You're a dream
coming true #

1197
01:22:48,411 --> 01:22:51,331
# I can't believe how I have #

1198
01:22:51,414 --> 01:22:53,958
# Fallen for you #

1199
01:22:56,086 --> 01:22:59,130
# You are the one #

1200
01:22:59,214 --> 01:23:04,219
# Who's led me to the sun #

1201
01:23:04,302 --> 01:23:05,231
# How could I know #

1202
01:23:05,402 --> 01:23:07,931
You don't want to go to San Francisco
in a limousine?

1203
01:23:08,014 --> 01:23:11,977
- # I was lost without you #
- I've never been on a plane before.

1204
01:23:12,018 --> 01:23:15,605
# And I want to tell you #

1205
01:23:15,647 --> 01:23:19,109
# You control my brain #

1206
01:23:20,944 --> 01:23:23,446
# And you should know that #

1207
01:23:23,530 --> 01:23:26,992
# You are life in my veins ##

1208
01:23:27,075 --> 01:23:29,369
Well, it should
be a pretty smooth flight, Mr. Lewis.

1209
01:23:29,452 --> 01:23:31,454
The weather is clear
all the way up to San Francisco.

1210
01:23:31,538 --> 01:23:34,499
We should be there
in about 50 minutes.

1211
01:23:45,677 --> 01:23:48,805
- We're late.
- No, it's all right.

1212
01:23:48,888 --> 01:23:53,018
- Opening night never starts on time.
- Okay.

1213
01:23:53,101 --> 01:23:55,020
- Program, sir.
- Thank you.

1214
01:23:58,648 --> 01:24:00,567
How nice to meet you.

1215
01:24:04,195 --> 01:24:06,614
Right this way,
Mr. Lewis, sir.

1216
01:24:11,119 --> 01:24:13,955
- Doris, how nice to see you.
- How are you?

1217
01:24:14,039 --> 01:24:16,374
- Sir. Wonderful news. Congratulations.
- Good evening, Edward.

1218
01:24:16,458 --> 01:24:18,710
- Hey, come here. You gotta look at this.
- It's all right.

1219
01:24:18,793 --> 01:24:20,006
I've already seen it.

1220
01:24:20,293 --> 01:24:23,506
If you're afraid of heights,
why do you get seats up here?

1221
01:24:23,590 --> 01:24:25,925
Because they're the best.

1222
01:24:26,009 --> 01:24:28,178
- Is there anything else, sir?
- No, thank you.

1223
01:24:28,219 --> 01:24:32,057
- The glasses are there. Enjoy the opera.
- Oh!

1224
01:24:32,098 --> 01:24:35,560
- So, you said this is in Italian.
- Uh-huh.

1225
01:24:35,644 --> 01:24:38,772
So how am I gonna know what
they're singin'? These are broken.

1226
01:24:38,855 --> 01:24:42,359
- Mine are broken.
- No, no. That's okay It's all right.

1227
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:45,362
- Oh.
- You'll know. Believe me, you'll understand.

1228
01:24:45,403 --> 01:24:47,364
The music's very powerful.

1229
01:24:50,450 --> 01:24:52,577
There's a band!

1230
01:24:54,746 --> 01:24:58,833
People's reactions to opera the first
time they see it is very dramatic.

1231
01:24:58,917 --> 01:25:01,753
They either love it
or they hate it.

1232
01:25:01,836 --> 01:25:04,756
If they love it,
they will always love it.

1233
01:25:04,839 --> 01:25:07,759
If they don't,
they may learn to appreciate it,

1234
01:25:07,842 --> 01:25:11,930
but it will never
become part of their soul.

1235
01:27:07,087 --> 01:27:12,175
- Did you enjoy the opera, dear?
- Oh, it was so good, I almost peed in my pants.

1236
01:27:12,258 --> 01:27:14,260
What?

1237
01:27:14,344 --> 01:27:18,264
She said she liked it better
than Pirates of Penzance.

1238
01:27:18,348 --> 01:27:20,266
- Oh!
- Yes.

1239
01:27:20,350 --> 01:27:22,268
Good-bye now.

1240
01:27:28,108 --> 01:27:30,193
- No, don't touch-
- I moved the queen. I like the queen.

1241
01:27:30,235 --> 01:27:32,404
You can't move the queen.

1242
01:27:32,529 --> 01:27:34,322
Did you really do that?

1243
01:27:36,408 --> 01:27:41,246
Why don't we finish this tomorrow?
It's really late, and I have to work.

1244
01:27:41,329 --> 01:27:45,667
Why don't you not go to work tomorrow.
Take the day off.

1245
01:27:45,709 --> 01:27:48,586
- Me, not work?
- Yeah.

1246
01:27:52,048 --> 01:27:54,009
I do own the company.

1247
01:28:06,021 --> 01:28:09,691
Here are the storage reports you wanted,
and Mr. Lewis called.

1248
01:28:09,733 --> 01:28:13,862
- What'd he say?
- He said he's taking the day off.

1249
01:28:13,903 --> 01:28:16,740
- He's taking the day off?
- That's what he said.

1250
01:28:19,534 --> 01:28:24,122
I'm starving. There's a snap dog vendor
over there. Do you have any money?

1251
01:28:24,205 --> 01:28:26,541
I have money. I don't know what
a snap dog is, but I have money.

1252
01:28:26,583 --> 01:28:27,995
Well, I'm gonna give, um...

1253
01:28:28,183 --> 01:28:30,295
You'll buy a snap dog;
we'll cop a squat under a tree somewhere.

1254
01:28:30,378 --> 01:28:32,297
- Cop a what?
- Cop a squat.

1255
01:28:32,380 --> 01:28:35,300
All right,
read the first two pages.

1256
01:28:35,383 --> 01:28:37,177
Okay.

1257
01:28:38,261 --> 01:28:40,180
Mmm.

1258
01:28:42,223 --> 01:28:44,851
I was talking to someone.

1259
01:29:23,561 --> 01:29:25,730
He sleeps.

1260
01:31:56,172 --> 01:31:58,132
I love you.

1261
01:32:09,226 --> 01:32:12,146
What are you thinkin' about
sittin' here all by yourself?

1262
01:32:12,229 --> 01:32:17,234
The fact that this will be our last night
together, and you'll finally be rid of me.

1263
01:32:17,318 --> 01:32:20,863
Well, you've been pretty tough to take.

1264
01:32:20,946 --> 01:32:24,367
My business is almost over,
so I'll be going back to New York.

1265
01:32:28,537 --> 01:32:31,123
I'd really like
to see you again.

1266
01:32:31,165 --> 01:32:33,542
- You would?
- Yes.

1267
01:32:33,626 --> 01:32:38,297
Yes, I would, so I've arranged for you
to have an apartment, to have a car,

1268
01:32:38,339 --> 01:32:42,843
a wide variety of stores guaranteed to suck
up to you anytime you want to go shopping.

1269
01:32:42,927 --> 01:32:47,348
- Everything's done.
- What else?

1270
01:32:47,390 --> 01:32:50,309
You gonna leave some money by the bed
when you pass through town?

1271
01:32:51,394 --> 01:32:53,729
Vivian, it really
wouldn't be like that.

1272
01:32:53,813 --> 01:32:56,107
How would it be?

1273
01:32:56,190 --> 01:32:58,829
Well, for one thing,
it would get you off the streets.

1274
01:32:59,190 --> 01:33:01,529
That's just geography.

1275
01:33:11,205 --> 01:33:15,126
Vivian, what is it you want?

1276
01:33:17,211 --> 01:33:20,047
What do you see
happening between us?

1277
01:33:20,089 --> 01:33:22,383
I don't know.

1278
01:33:26,012 --> 01:33:29,015
When I was a little girl,

1279
01:33:29,098 --> 01:33:34,395
my mama used to lock me in the attic
when I was bad, which was pretty often.

1280
01:33:34,437 --> 01:33:38,607
And I would- I would
pretend I was a princess...

1281
01:33:38,691 --> 01:33:41,319
trapped in a tower
by a wicked queen.

1282
01:33:41,402 --> 01:33:45,823
And then suddenly
this knight...

1283
01:33:45,906 --> 01:33:51,579
on a white horse with these colors flying
would come charging up and draw his sword.

1284
01:33:51,620 --> 01:33:53,873
And I would wave.

1285
01:33:53,914 --> 01:33:58,044
And he would climb up the tower
and rescue me.

1286
01:34:01,797 --> 01:34:03,799
But never in all the time...

1287
01:34:03,883 --> 01:34:08,763
that I had this dream
did the knight say to me,

1288
01:34:08,804 --> 01:34:12,224
"Come on, baby, I'll put you up
in a great condo. "

1289
01:34:20,900 --> 01:34:22,818
- Yes.
- I had to call.

1290
01:34:22,902 --> 01:34:25,321
I just got off the phone
with James Morse. Get this.

1291
01:34:25,404 --> 01:34:27,823
- He wants to meet with you today.
- What about?

1292
01:34:27,907 --> 01:34:31,494
He wouldn't say. Edward, I think we
got him. His nuts are on the block.

1293
01:34:31,577 --> 01:34:33,496
We got him!

1294
01:34:33,579 --> 01:34:37,291
Look, if he's really caving in, I want to get
him to commit his stocks to us this afternoon.

1295
01:34:37,375 --> 01:34:40,503
No, it's no good. If he's really caving in,
I don't want to wait 'til this afternoon.

1296
01:34:40,586 --> 01:34:43,506
Have Morse meet me downtown
this morning. Good-bye.

1297
01:34:51,472 --> 01:34:54,308
I have to go now,

1298
01:34:54,392 --> 01:34:58,187
but I want you to understand...

1299
01:34:58,270 --> 01:35:00,189
I heard everything you said.

1300
01:35:01,649 --> 01:35:04,819
This is all
I'm capable of right now.

1301
01:35:04,902 --> 01:35:06,821
It's a very big step for me.

1302
01:35:08,572 --> 01:35:12,994
I know. It's a really good offer
for a girl like me.

1303
01:35:15,204 --> 01:35:17,665
I've never treated you
like a prostitute.

1304
01:35:24,338 --> 01:35:26,257
You just did.

1305
01:35:28,342 --> 01:35:31,804
It's Barnard Thompson here,
Miss Vivian.

1306
01:35:31,846 --> 01:35:35,725
Could you come down to the front desk?
There's someone here who wants to speak to you.

1307
01:35:35,808 --> 01:35:38,311
- She says her name is Miss De Luca-
- Let me talk to her.

1308
01:35:38,394 --> 01:35:41,689
Let me-
Let me just talk to her.

1309
01:35:41,772 --> 01:35:46,694
Yo, Viv, babe. Would you come down here?
The sphincter police won't let me through.

1310
01:35:46,736 --> 01:35:49,322
- Okay. She's on her way.
- Fine.

1311
01:35:49,405 --> 01:35:51,365
- Mr. Thompson.
- Yes.

1312
01:35:51,407 --> 01:35:54,201
The window washer
is refusing to come down.

1313
01:35:54,285 --> 01:35:56,370
It's a Saturday.
Wait here, please.

1314
01:35:56,454 --> 01:35:58,873
- Watch her.
- Yes, sir.

1315
01:36:10,343 --> 01:36:15,473
Fifty bucks, Grandpa.
For 75, the wife can watch.

1316
01:36:19,310 --> 01:36:21,145
Listen, I've been calling you.

1317
01:36:21,228 --> 01:36:23,564
Yeah, I know. They told me
at the Banana you were lookin' for me.

1318
01:36:23,606 --> 01:36:25,608
You were supposed to come by Tuesday.
I left the money at the desk.

1319
01:36:25,691 --> 01:36:27,902
- I was hidin' from Carlos.
- Well, if you picked up the money,

1320
01:36:27,943 --> 01:36:31,572
- you wouldn't have to hide.
- I was busy. I had a life. Nino got beat up.

1321
01:36:31,656 --> 01:36:35,201
We had to visit him in the hospital,
Rachel got arrested. It was a mess.

1322
01:36:35,242 --> 01:36:39,538
Anyway, I got the money. Thank you very much
for saving my ass. Now Carlos can get off of it.

1323
01:36:39,580 --> 01:36:42,083
You know, he was talkin'
about you last night.

1324
01:36:42,124 --> 01:36:44,085
He would bust somethin'
if he saw you in this outfit.

1325
01:36:44,126 --> 01:36:48,381
I was afraid to hug you up there.
I might wrinkle you!

1326
01:36:48,422 --> 01:36:53,010
- You look really good. No, something in the shade.
- Over there.

1327
01:36:53,094 --> 01:36:55,721
You clean up real nice.

1328
01:36:55,763 --> 01:36:59,141
You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard
lookin' like you do, not that you ever did.

1329
01:36:59,225 --> 01:37:02,728
Well, thanks, but it's easy
to clean up when you got money.

1330
01:37:02,770 --> 01:37:05,690
Yeah.

1331
01:37:05,773 --> 01:37:09,402
- So, when does he leave?
- Tomorrow.

1332
01:37:09,443 --> 01:37:13,072
- You get to keep the clothes?
- Yeah.

1333
01:37:13,155 --> 01:37:18,619
Edward asked me
if I wanted to see him again.

1334
01:37:18,661 --> 01:37:23,249
But I think, I think definitely no.
It's just another week, right?

1335
01:37:23,290 --> 01:37:26,335
- "Definitely no. "
- Yeah.

1336
01:37:26,419 --> 01:37:28,629
Oh, no.

1337
01:37:28,713 --> 01:37:30,631
What?

1338
01:37:30,715 --> 01:37:33,759
- I know this weepy look on your face.
- Oh, no, you don't!

1339
01:37:33,801 --> 01:37:36,345
- You fell in love with him.
- No. Kit, please. Stop it.

1340
01:37:36,429 --> 01:37:38,347
- You've fallen in love with him?
- Kit!

1341
01:37:38,431 --> 01:37:41,517
- Did you kiss him? On the mouth?
- Uh, yeah, I did.

1342
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:43,519
- You kissed him on the mouth?
- I did. It was nice.

1343
01:37:43,602 --> 01:37:46,605
You fall in love with him, and you kiss him
on the mouth. Did I not teach you anything?

1344
01:37:46,689 --> 01:37:51,027
Look, I'm not stupid, okay?
I'm- I'm not in love with him.

1345
01:37:51,110 --> 01:37:53,571
I just- I like him.

1346
01:37:53,654 --> 01:37:55,614
You like him?

1347
01:37:55,656 --> 01:37:58,951
- Yeah.
- You definitely like him.

1348
01:38:00,161 --> 01:38:02,997
Well, he's not a bum.
He's a rich, classy guy.

1349
01:38:03,039 --> 01:38:06,125
- Who's gonna break my heart, right?
- Oh, no. Come on.

1350
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:08,502
You don't know that.
Hey, he asked you, right?

1351
01:38:08,544 --> 01:38:11,839
Maybe you guys could, like, um,
you know, get a house together.

1352
01:38:11,881 --> 01:38:13,966
Like, buy some diamonds
and a horse. I don't know.

1353
01:38:14,008 --> 01:38:17,053
Anyway, it could work.
It happens.

1354
01:38:19,013 --> 01:38:21,140
When does it happen, Kit?

1355
01:38:21,182 --> 01:38:23,142
When does it really happen?
Who does it really work out for?

1356
01:38:23,184 --> 01:38:25,436
Did it work out for Skinny Marie
or Rachel? No!

1357
01:38:25,519 --> 01:38:27,855
Those were very specific cases
of crackheads.

1358
01:38:27,938 --> 01:38:30,191
I just wanna know
who it works out for.

1359
01:38:30,232 --> 01:38:33,194
You give me one example of somebody that
we know that it happened for.

1360
01:38:33,235 --> 01:38:35,196
- Name someone?
- Yeah, one person that it worked out for.

1361
01:38:35,237 --> 01:38:38,199
- You want me to give you a name or something.
- Yeah.

1362
01:38:38,240 --> 01:38:40,701
Oh, God, the pressure
of a name.

1363
01:38:43,621 --> 01:38:45,706
Cinder-fuckin'- rella.

1364
01:38:51,990 --> 01:38:55,118
Mr. Morse, you said this morning
you wished to speak to Mr. Lewis.

1365
01:38:55,201 --> 01:38:57,495
Mr. Lewis is now listening.

1366
01:38:57,578 --> 01:39:02,959
I've reconsidered my position
on your acquisition offer...

1367
01:39:03,042 --> 01:39:04,961
on one condition.

1368
01:39:05,044 --> 01:39:10,049
I'm not so concerned about me,
but the people who are working for me.

1369
01:39:10,133 --> 01:39:12,093
It's not a problem.
They'll be taken care of.

1370
01:39:12,135 --> 01:39:15,305
Well, then, gentlemen. If we could address
ourselves to the contracts in front of you.

1371
01:39:15,388 --> 01:39:18,641
- If you look at-
- Excuse me, Phil.

1372
01:39:18,725 --> 01:39:23,604
Gentlemen,
I'd like to speak to Mr. Morse alone.

1373
01:39:23,688 --> 01:39:25,565
Thank you.

1374
01:39:27,567 --> 01:39:30,278
All right, gentlemen, you heard
the man. Please wait outside.

1375
01:39:32,155 --> 01:39:34,407
You too, Phil.

1376
01:39:34,490 --> 01:39:37,327
What do you mean?

1377
01:39:37,410 --> 01:39:39,912
I mean I would like to speak
to Mr. Morse alone.

1378
01:39:41,831 --> 01:39:46,461
- Why does he get to stay?
- Please, please.

1379
01:39:50,131 --> 01:39:53,426
- I'll be right outside.
- Good.

1380
01:40:10,151 --> 01:40:12,195
- Is that better?
- It's all right.

1381
01:40:12,278 --> 01:40:16,032
- Would you like a cup of coffee?
- Black.

1382
01:40:18,159 --> 01:40:21,496
Mr. Morse,

1383
01:40:21,579 --> 01:40:24,123
my interests in your company
have changed.

1384
01:40:24,165 --> 01:40:29,003
What is it you're after now,
Mr. Lewis?

1385
01:40:29,087 --> 01:40:32,215
Well, I no longer wish to buy
your company and take it apart.

1386
01:40:32,298 --> 01:40:35,134
But I don't want anyone
else to, either.

1387
01:40:35,176 --> 01:40:39,430
And it is still
extremely vulnerable.

1388
01:40:39,514 --> 01:40:44,769
So I find myself...
in unfamiliar territory.

1389
01:40:44,852 --> 01:40:46,771
I wanna help you.

1390
01:40:46,854 --> 01:40:49,691
Why?

1391
01:40:58,074 --> 01:41:02,161
Mr. Morse, I think we can do something
very special with your company.

1392
01:41:02,245 --> 01:41:04,914
What about our Navy contracts?

1393
01:41:04,998 --> 01:41:09,877
Ah, they weren't dead. Just delayed.
I... bluffed a little bit.

1394
01:41:09,961 --> 01:41:12,005
- You're very good at it.
- Thank you very much.

1395
01:41:12,046 --> 01:41:15,675
It's my job.

1396
01:41:15,717 --> 01:41:18,428
I think we can leave the details
up to the others.

1397
01:41:18,511 --> 01:41:22,265
I find this hard to say
without sounding condescending, but...

1398
01:41:22,348 --> 01:41:26,060
I'm proud of you.

1399
01:41:27,353 --> 01:41:29,272
Thank you.

1400
01:41:31,441 --> 01:41:34,485
I think we can let in
the other suits now.

1401
01:41:35,987 --> 01:41:40,199
Let's continue the meeting.

1402
01:41:40,241 --> 01:41:42,535
Come in, gentlemen.
Sit down.

1403
01:41:42,618 --> 01:41:45,788
Edward, please,
what was this all about? Hmm?

1404
01:41:45,872 --> 01:41:49,000
It's all yours, Phil.
Finish it up.

1405
01:41:51,878 --> 01:41:54,464
Hold it. Hold it.
These aren't signed!

1406
01:41:54,547 --> 01:41:58,217
These aren't signed! Could someone please
tell me what the fuck is going on here?

1407
01:41:58,259 --> 01:42:01,804
Mr. Lewis and I are going
to build ships together.

1408
01:42:01,888 --> 01:42:04,557
Great big ships.

1409
01:42:06,809 --> 01:42:08,770
You know, I think I'm gonna
go for a walk.

1410
01:42:08,811 --> 01:42:11,898
- Just stay here for a while. I'll be back.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Lewis.

1411
01:42:34,128 --> 01:42:38,841
Well, well. Hello again.
I'm looking for Edward.

1412
01:42:38,925 --> 01:42:41,636
Edward's not here.
I thought he was with you.

1413
01:42:41,719 --> 01:42:46,516
No. Uh, Edward is definitely
not with me.

1414
01:42:48,601 --> 01:42:52,480
No, if Edward were with me-

1415
01:42:52,563 --> 01:42:57,276
When. Actually, when...
Edward was with me,

1416
01:42:57,360 --> 01:43:00,822
he didn't blow off
billion dollar deals!

1417
01:43:00,863 --> 01:43:05,576
I think that, uh, Edward's with you.
That's what I think.

1418
01:43:05,660 --> 01:43:08,788
- Mind if I have a drink?
- No.

1419
01:43:08,830 --> 01:43:10,790
No, thank you.

1420
01:43:12,041 --> 01:43:15,128
Well, I'll just wait.

1421
01:43:15,211 --> 01:43:19,299
Uh, Edward will be back soon.
Any minute, he'll be home.

1422
01:43:21,968 --> 01:43:25,013
You know,

1423
01:43:25,096 --> 01:43:27,432
this is not home.

1424
01:43:27,515 --> 01:43:30,310
This is, uh,
a hotel room.

1425
01:43:30,351 --> 01:43:33,229
And, uh, you are not...

1426
01:43:33,313 --> 01:43:36,774
the little woman.

1427
01:43:36,858 --> 01:43:39,819
You're a hooker.

1428
01:43:39,902 --> 01:43:42,864
Maybe you're a very good
hooker, you know?

1429
01:43:42,905 --> 01:43:46,743
Maybe if I do you, then I wouldn't care
about losing millions of dollars.

1430
01:43:46,826 --> 01:43:49,412
Because I have to be
very honest with you.

1431
01:43:49,495 --> 01:43:52,373
Right now, Vivian, right now
I really do care. I really do.

1432
01:43:52,415 --> 01:43:56,502
And right now
I am really pissed, you know?

1433
01:43:56,544 --> 01:43:59,547
Right now I am
just freaking out.

1434
01:44:01,007 --> 01:44:03,217
So maybe if I
screw you, huh,

1435
01:44:03,301 --> 01:44:05,887
and take you to the opera, then I could
be a happy guy, just like Edward.

1436
01:44:05,970 --> 01:44:09,599
- Hey, get off me!
- Hey, hey! Goddamn it!

1437
01:44:09,682 --> 01:44:12,310
- Ow!
- Ow!

1438
01:44:12,393 --> 01:44:15,229
- Come on! Come on! I'll pay for it.
- Get off me!

1439
01:44:15,313 --> 01:44:17,315
- How much is it? Twenty bucks, thirty bucks?
- Get off me! Get off me!

1440
01:44:17,398 --> 01:44:20,193
- Fifty? You a $50 whore, Vivian?
- What are you doing?

1441
01:44:20,234 --> 01:44:23,529
- Get off!
- Stop. I don't want to hurt you! Stop it!

1442
01:44:23,571 --> 01:44:25,615
You already did,
Edward!

1443
01:44:25,698 --> 01:44:28,159
- Out. Out of here.
- All right, all right.

1444
01:44:28,242 --> 01:44:32,121
Look, she's a whore, man.
She's a goddamn- Aah!

1445
01:44:34,582 --> 01:44:37,919
- Aah! Damn.
- Shit. Goddamn!

1446
01:44:39,379 --> 01:44:41,547
- I think you broke my nose.
- Get outta here.

1447
01:44:41,589 --> 01:44:44,884
What is wrong with you? Come on,
Edward! I gave you ten years!

1448
01:44:44,968 --> 01:44:49,055
- I devoted my whole life to you!
- That's bullshit.

1449
01:44:49,097 --> 01:44:52,308
This is such bullshit!
It's the kill you love, not me!

1450
01:44:52,392 --> 01:44:55,561
I made you a very rich man
doing exactly what you loved.

1451
01:44:55,645 --> 01:44:57,605
Now get outta here!

1452
01:44:59,023 --> 01:45:00,942
Get out!

1453
01:45:10,618 --> 01:45:13,621
Why do guys always know how to hit
a woman right across the cheek?

1454
01:45:13,705 --> 01:45:17,417
Wham! And it feels like
your eye is gonna explode.

1455
01:45:17,458 --> 01:45:21,129
What do they do? Do they pull you aside
in high school and show you how to do this?

1456
01:45:21,212 --> 01:45:23,131
Is that- Ow.

1457
01:45:26,884 --> 01:45:28,803
Not all guys hit.

1458
01:45:31,681 --> 01:45:34,642
I heard about
what you did with Morse.

1459
01:45:36,185 --> 01:45:39,647
- That was a business decision.
- It was good.

1460
01:45:41,024 --> 01:45:43,443
It felt good.

1461
01:45:46,362 --> 01:45:49,198
I think this is okay.

1462
01:45:49,282 --> 01:45:51,159
I gotta get going.

1463
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:53,870
Yes, I noticed you're packed.

1464
01:45:53,953 --> 01:45:56,205
Why are you leaving now?

1465
01:45:58,541 --> 01:46:02,337
Edward, there'll always be some guy,
even some friend of yours,

1466
01:46:02,420 --> 01:46:04,589
thinkin' he can treat me
like Stuckey,

1467
01:46:04,672 --> 01:46:07,216
thinking that it's allowed.

1468
01:46:07,300 --> 01:46:11,471
What are you gonna do?
You gonna beat up everybody?

1469
01:46:11,512 --> 01:46:14,557
That's not why you're leaving.

1470
01:46:15,725 --> 01:46:19,112
Look, you made me a really nice offer.

1471
01:46:19,896 --> 01:46:23,232
And a few months ago,
no problem.

1472
01:46:23,316 --> 01:46:25,985
But now everything is different,
and you've changed that.

1473
01:46:26,069 --> 01:46:29,864
And you can't change back.

1474
01:46:29,947 --> 01:46:31,866
I want more.

1475
01:46:33,576 --> 01:46:36,037
I know about wanting more.

1476
01:46:36,079 --> 01:46:38,873
I invented the concept.

1477
01:46:38,957 --> 01:46:42,502
The question is how much more.

1478
01:46:44,087 --> 01:46:46,047
I want the fairy tale.

1479
01:46:48,132 --> 01:46:50,051
Impossible relationships.

1480
01:46:52,220 --> 01:46:57,141
My special gift is
impossible relationships.

1481
01:47:09,612 --> 01:47:13,700
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1482
01:47:15,451 --> 01:47:20,999
If you ever need anything- dental
floss, whatever- you give me a call.

1483
01:47:25,044 --> 01:47:27,213
I had a good time.

1484
01:47:27,297 --> 01:47:29,215
Me too.

1485
01:47:39,642 --> 01:47:41,769
Do you want me
to get you a bellboy?

1486
01:47:41,853 --> 01:47:44,897
- No, I got it.
- I'll carry this.

1487
01:47:44,981 --> 01:47:46,941
Thanks.

1488
01:47:53,614 --> 01:47:57,285
Stay. Stay the night with me.

1489
01:47:57,368 --> 01:48:00,496
And not because I'm paying you,
but because you want to.

1490
01:48:05,877 --> 01:48:08,338
I can't.

1491
01:48:14,802 --> 01:48:16,721
Good-bye.

1492
01:48:23,561 --> 01:48:27,565
I think you have
a lot of special gifts.

1493
01:48:28,650 --> 01:48:30,568
Mmm.

1494
01:48:39,994 --> 01:48:42,956
- I didn't do it, sir.
- No, no. I didn't say that.

1495
01:48:42,997 --> 01:48:46,376
I want you to call maintenance and have them
deal with this. You must delegate authority.

1496
01:48:46,459 --> 01:48:48,461
- Yes, sir.
- Hi, Barney.

1497
01:48:49,754 --> 01:48:53,007
Miss Vivian. Thank you.

1498
01:48:54,050 --> 01:48:56,010
I wanted to say good-bye.

1499
01:48:56,052 --> 01:48:59,013
Well, then, I gather you're not
accompanying Mr. Lewis to New York.

1500
01:48:59,097 --> 01:49:03,935
Come on, Barney. You and me live
in the real world... most of the time.

1501
01:49:05,269 --> 01:49:07,188
Have you arranged
for transportation?

1502
01:49:07,271 --> 01:49:09,190
- I'm gonna call a cab.
- Allow me.

1503
01:49:09,273 --> 01:49:11,693
- Darryl.
- Yes, sir.

1504
01:49:11,734 --> 01:49:14,821
Please take Miss Vivian
anywhere she wishes to go.

1505
01:49:14,862 --> 01:49:16,823
Yes, sir.

1506
01:49:23,246 --> 01:49:25,206
It's been a pleasure
knowing you.

1507
01:49:25,248 --> 01:49:28,084
Come and visit us again
sometime.

1508
01:49:29,836 --> 01:49:31,754
Stay cool.

1509
01:49:44,225 --> 01:49:47,186
# Lay a whisper #

1510
01:49:47,270 --> 01:49:50,356
# On my pillow #

1511
01:49:50,440 --> 01:49:53,484
# Leave the winter #

1512
01:49:53,568 --> 01:49:56,237
# On the ground #

1513
01:49:56,321 --> 01:49:59,157
# I wake up lonely #

1514
01:49:59,240 --> 01:50:02,327
# The stare of silence #

1515
01:50:02,410 --> 01:50:05,246
# In the bedroom #

1516
01:50:05,330 --> 01:50:08,458
# And all around #

1517
01:50:08,541 --> 01:50:11,252
# Touch me now #

1518
01:50:11,294 --> 01:50:14,255
# I close my eyes #

1519
01:50:14,339 --> 01:50:17,592
# And dream away #

1520
01:50:19,719 --> 01:50:22,388
# It must have been love #

1521
01:50:22,472 --> 01:50:25,683
# But it's over now #

1522
01:50:25,767 --> 01:50:28,436
# It must have been good #

1523
01:50:28,478 --> 01:50:31,481
# But I lost it somehow #

1524
01:50:31,564 --> 01:50:34,359
# It must have been love #

1525
01:50:34,442 --> 01:50:37,612
# But it's over now #

1526
01:50:37,695 --> 01:50:39,989
# From the moment we touched #

1527
01:50:40,073 --> 01:50:43,576
# 'Til the time had run out ##

1528
01:51:01,094 --> 01:51:03,012
Is that everything, sir?

1529
01:51:03,096 --> 01:51:05,098
Yes. Yes, that's everything.

1530
01:51:05,181 --> 01:51:07,475
- I'll meet you downstairs, sir.
- Thank you.

1531
01:51:10,269 --> 01:51:12,897
We look so dopey.

1532
01:51:14,107 --> 01:51:17,318
San Francisco's not
that great, you know.

1533
01:51:17,402 --> 01:51:21,406
It's bad climate. It's foggy.
It's unpredictable.

1534
01:51:21,489 --> 01:51:23,533
I'll wear a sweater.

1535
01:51:23,616 --> 01:51:25,743
What are you gonna do there?

1536
01:51:25,827 --> 01:51:28,371
Get a job.
Finish high school.

1537
01:51:28,454 --> 01:51:32,041
I got things I can do. I used to make
pretty good grades in high school.

1538
01:51:32,125 --> 01:51:35,086
Yeah, I could see that about you.
I could see that.

1539
01:51:39,215 --> 01:51:41,759
Sure you won't come with me?

1540
01:51:41,843 --> 01:51:44,512
And leave all this?
Not in a million.

1541
01:51:45,930 --> 01:51:48,057
Come here.

1542
01:51:52,478 --> 01:51:55,356
Whoa. Whoa. What is this?

1543
01:51:56,816 --> 01:52:00,028
It's part of the Edward Lewis
scholarship fund.

1544
01:52:00,069 --> 01:52:02,739
We think you got a lot
of potential, Kit De Luca.

1545
01:52:02,822 --> 01:52:07,535
You do? You think
I got potential?

1546
01:52:07,577 --> 01:52:11,748
Oh, yeah. Don't let anybody
tell you different, okay?

1547
01:52:11,831 --> 01:52:14,292
Okay.

1548
01:52:14,375 --> 01:52:16,336
Take care of you.

1549
01:52:16,419 --> 01:52:18,963
No, I can't, I can't.
It's your favorite.

1550
01:52:21,007 --> 01:52:23,551
What time's your bus?

1551
01:52:23,635 --> 01:52:25,637
An hour.

1552
01:52:25,720 --> 01:52:28,473
Yeah, well, I gotta split,
'cause good-byes make me crazy.

1553
01:52:28,556 --> 01:52:32,727
- So, take care of you.
- Whoa.

1554
01:52:36,522 --> 01:52:38,441
Mr. Lewis.

1555
01:52:38,524 --> 01:52:41,235
You don't have
any messages for me, do you?

1556
01:52:41,319 --> 01:52:43,780
No, I'm afraid not, sir.

1557
01:52:46,240 --> 01:52:48,326
I'll need a car
to the airport also.

1558
01:52:48,409 --> 01:52:50,995
Of course. Darryl will take you
wherever you need to go.

1559
01:52:51,079 --> 01:52:53,289
- Darryl, the limousine out front, please?
- Yes, sir.

1560
01:52:53,373 --> 01:52:56,084
Thank you, Darryl.

1561
01:52:57,669 --> 01:52:59,587
- One last thing. If you could possibly...
- Yes.

1562
01:52:59,671 --> 01:53:02,757
- return this to Fred's for me, please.
- Yes, of course.

1563
01:53:02,840 --> 01:53:05,009
May I, sir?

1564
01:53:05,093 --> 01:53:07,595
Of course, please.

1565
01:53:14,894 --> 01:53:17,897
It must be difficult
to let go of something so beautiful.

1566
01:53:20,108 --> 01:53:24,570
You know, Darryl also drove
Miss Vivian home yesterday.

1567
01:53:28,574 --> 01:53:30,493
I'll take care of it.

1568
01:53:31,995 --> 01:53:34,122
Thank you, Mr. Thompson.

1569
01:53:46,009 --> 01:53:48,678
Your plane is leaving
as scheduled, sir,

1570
01:53:48,761 --> 01:53:51,472
and you should be back
in New York on time.

1571
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:05,320
I'm gonna have to charge
you a little more rent than Vivian...

1572
01:54:05,403 --> 01:54:07,322
because I've got this beauty course
I'm looking into.

1573
01:54:07,405 --> 01:54:09,324
I'm not gonna be there
that much, you know?

1574
01:54:09,407 --> 01:54:11,826
'Cause you can't- You just can't
turn tricks forever.

1575
01:54:11,909 --> 01:54:14,245
You gotta have a goal.
Do you have a goal?

1576
01:54:14,370 --> 01:54:16,456
Well, I always wanted
to be in the Ice Capades.

1577
01:54:16,539 --> 01:54:20,501
- Help you, love?
- There you go. Thank you very much.

1578
01:54:20,585 --> 01:54:22,837
So, you got a lot of stuff
you gotta move in?

1579
01:54:22,920 --> 01:54:25,882
No, Carlos burned most of my stuff
when I said I was movin' out.

1580
01:54:52,867 --> 01:54:54,786
Vivian!

1581
01:54:54,869 --> 01:54:56,913
Vivian.

1582
01:55:01,459 --> 01:55:05,296
Princess Vivian!
Come down!

1583
01:55:09,634 --> 01:55:12,136
- Had to be the top floor, right?
- It's the best.

1584
01:55:12,220 --> 01:55:14,973
All right.
I'm coming up.

1585
01:55:49,632 --> 01:55:54,762
So what happened after he climbed up
the tower and rescued her?

1586
01:55:54,846 --> 01:55:57,557
She rescues him right back.

1587
01:56:08,359 --> 01:56:11,571
Welcome to Hollywood.
What's your dream?

1588
01:56:11,654 --> 01:56:16,492
Everybody comes here.
This is Hollywood, the land of dreams.

1589
01:56:16,534 --> 01:56:20,830
Some dreams come true, some don't.
But keep on dreamin'.

1590
01:56:20,872 --> 01:56:26,336
This is Hollywood. Always time
to dream, so keep on dreamin'.

1591
01:56:26,502 --> 01:56:27,712
# Pretty woman #

1592
01:56:27,795 --> 01:56:29,797
# Walkin' down the street #

1593
01:56:29,881 --> 01:56:33,593
# Pretty woman
The kind I like to meet #

1594
01:56:33,676 --> 01:56:36,304
# Pretty woman #

1595
01:56:36,387 --> 01:56:40,099
# I don't believe you
You're not the truth #

1596
01:56:40,183 --> 01:56:44,812
# No one could look
as good as you #

1597
01:56:46,522 --> 01:56:48,441
# Mercy #

1598
01:56:51,444 --> 01:56:55,323
# Pretty woman
won't you pardon me #

1599
01:56:55,365 --> 01:56:59,118
# Pretty woman
I couldn't help but see #

1600
01:56:59,202 --> 01:57:01,829
# Pretty woman #

1601
01:57:01,913 --> 01:57:05,708
# That you look lovely
as can be #

1602
01:57:05,792 --> 01:57:09,629
# Are you lonely
just like me #

1603
01:57:11,673 --> 01:57:16,719
# Oh, pretty woman ##

1604
01:57:32,276 --> 01:57:36,698
# You really took me
by surprise #

1605
01:57:39,284 --> 01:57:44,497
# You're someone
I've needed for a lifetime #

1606
01:57:46,374 --> 01:57:50,003
# Your heart
was cleverly disguised #

1607
01:57:53,298 --> 01:57:58,052
# And it didn't look that way
in my mind #

1608
01:57:58,094 --> 01:58:01,139
# Tell me
how could it be #

1609
01:58:01,222 --> 01:58:05,476
# I was the last to know #

1610
01:58:05,560 --> 01:58:09,897
# Darlin', I couldn't read
what was in your mind #

1611
01:58:09,981 --> 01:58:13,526
# To turn around and love me #

1612
01:58:13,609 --> 01:58:16,571
# With no #

1613
01:58:16,654 --> 01:58:19,574
# Explanation #

1614
01:58:19,616 --> 01:58:23,369
# I gave you everything I have #

1615
01:58:23,453 --> 01:58:27,373
# I didn't know
that you would take it #

1616
01:58:27,457 --> 01:58:32,503
# With sweet consideration #

1617
01:58:33,838 --> 01:58:37,925
# And after all
that we've been through #

1618
01:58:38,009 --> 01:58:41,179
# I can't believe it's true #

1619
01:58:41,262 --> 01:58:45,725
# Until I hear you say #

1620
01:58:52,023 --> 01:58:54,817
# Ooh #

1621
01:58:58,404 --> 01:59:01,991
# I know now, now, now #

1622
