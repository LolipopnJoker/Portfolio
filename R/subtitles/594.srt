- Sonny...
- Oh, you keep your yap shut.

1098
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:26,532
[Chuckles] Your charm
is matched only by your odor.

1099
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:29,807
- And what does that mean?
- You're a malodorous ignoramus.

1100
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:33,111
- It's nothing, really.
- What's he saying? I'm confused.

1101
00:54:33,183 --> 00:54:35,117
And I don't like being confused.

1102
00:54:35,185 --> 00:54:38,849
- Yeah, he really doesn't.
- Really? Well, you'd think he'd get used to it, huh?

1103
00:54:38,922 --> 00:54:41,482
Let's go, Ava.
Tryin' to confuse me. [Mumbling]

1104
00:54:41,558 --> 00:54:44,858
Ava, don't go. Look, maybe you can
do better than me, but don't do worse.

1105
00:54:44,928 --> 00:54:47,192
- I thought you liked me.
- Of course I do.

1106
00:54:47,264 --> 00:54:49,756
<i>- [Sonny] Come on, Ava.</i>
- But you'll always be a city bear.

1107
00:54:49,833 --> 00:54:51,824
And I need more than that.

1108
00:54:51,902 --> 00:54:56,135
City bear.
[Sighs] Great.

1109
00:55:01,711 --> 00:55:03,873
Should we, uh,
put all our cards on the table?

1110
00:55:03,947 --> 00:55:05,938
Of course.

1111
00:55:07,517 --> 00:55:10,350
This bear you brought up here
has as much likelihood of making...

1112
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:12,445
little bear babies as Riley here.

1113
00:55:12,522 --> 00:55:14,456
Ain't-a-gonna happen.

1114
00:55:14,524 --> 00:55:16,458
<i>But, on the other hand,
thanks to you,</i>

1115
00:55:16,526 --> 00:55:19,655
<i>I'm not exactly drowning
in favorable publicity.</i>

1116
00:55:19,729 --> 00:55:23,825
So, here's my offer.
I will set aside ten acres,

1117
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,834
<i>turn it into a sanctuary.</i>

1118
00:55:25,902 --> 00:55:28,564
<i>You can bring all your little
animal buddies there.</i>

1119
00:55:28,638 --> 00:55:30,663
Plus, you'll be saving face.

1120
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:33,971
You won't have to admit you failed.
You don't look like a fool.

1121
00:55:35,045 --> 00:55:36,979
Look, ten acres is ridiculous.

1122
00:55:37,047 --> 00:55:39,141
That's the offer.

1123
00:55:39,216 --> 00:55:41,412
The deadline is Wednesday
at 12:00 noon. Let me be clear.

1124
00:55:41,485 --> 00:55:44,113
At 12:01,we'll be
sending in every logger,

1125
00:55:44,187 --> 00:55:46,656
<i>every piece of logging
equipment we've got.</i>

1126
00:55:46,723 --> 00:55:49,351
By Friday, there won't
be a tree standing.

1127
00:55:50,994 --> 00:55:54,294
[Sighs]
I need to run this by my wife.

1128
00:55:54,364 --> 00:55:57,390
<i>Excellent idea.
There's a pay phone in the back.</i>

1129
00:55:57,467 --> 00:55:59,561
Excuse me.

1130
00:56:02,305 --> 00:56:06,538
Calling the wife.
Always a sign of weakness.

1131
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:11,070
<i>[Archie]
Whoo-hoo, woo, woo. Hey, Johnny.</i>

1132
00:56:11,148 --> 00:56:12,946
What are you doing?

1133
00:56:13,016 --> 00:56:16,315
Doc, I know what to do.
I've got my big finish.

1134
00:56:17,653 --> 00:56:20,179
- Look. Come in here. Quick.
- All right.

1135
00:56:20,256 --> 00:56:22,987
Hey, I don't think
I'm allowed in here.

1136
00:56:25,161 --> 00:56:28,927
Okay, listen. I got to tell you.
This thing is over.

1137
00:56:28,998 --> 00:56:30,625
<i>I'm just sorry
I dragged you into all this.</i>

1138
00:56:30,699 --> 00:56:33,168
I'm going to have to get you
an audition in Vegas or something.

1139
00:56:33,235 --> 00:56:35,704
These guys offered me a deal,
and it's the best I can do.

1140
00:56:35,771 --> 00:56:38,502
No, no, no. The best you can do
is not give up on me, Doc.

1141
00:56:38,574 --> 00:56:41,805
Come on. You told me,
“Listen to your inner bear.” Remember?

1142
00:56:41,877 --> 00:56:45,711
- I don't know, Archie.
- Look, I know how I can win Ava.

1143
00:56:45,781 --> 00:56:48,307
Okay. I know
I'm nuts or something.

1144
00:56:48,384 --> 00:56:50,546
I'm gonna give it another shot.
I'll give you one more chance.

1145
00:56:50,619 --> 00:56:52,747
- Yes! Yes!
- Okay, let me get over...

1146
00:56:52,821 --> 00:56:55,449
- Uh-oh! Uh-oh!
- Uh-oh, what? What's the problem?

1147
00:56:55,524 --> 00:56:58,050
- Ice cream is acting up.
- What ice cream?

1148
00:56:58,127 --> 00:57:01,097
<i>I got depressed after Sonny and Ava,
and I went on a bender.</i>

1149
00:57:01,163 --> 00:57:04,428
<i>And by the second gallon,
I realized I'm in love with Ava...</i>

1150
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:07,868
<i>and this ice cream
called “Cherry Garcia.”</i>

1151
00:57:07,937 --> 00:57:10,736
- [Belches]
- Hey! Don't you dare throw up on me.

1152
00:57:10,806 --> 00:57:13,798
Ohh! That's not where
it's gonna come out. Ohh!

1153
00:57:13,876 --> 00:57:16,106
Wait. You got to do that,
sit down on the toilet.

1154
00:57:16,178 --> 00:57:19,170
- I can't hold it!
- Wait! You gotta lift the lid up first.

1155
00:57:19,248 --> 00:57:21,478
This is not going to be
big enough! Oh, boy!

1156
00:57:21,550 --> 00:57:23,917
You'll be fine. Just sit there.
I'm gonna keep guard outside.

1157
00:57:23,986 --> 00:57:26,717
<i>- I don't think it's...</i>
- Take care of what you got to take care.

1158
00:57:26,789 --> 00:57:29,224
Hey. I'll be with you in one second.
I'm gonna take care of business.

1159
00:57:29,291 --> 00:57:32,454
- Who you talking to in there?
- I'm talking to myself. I was-

1160
00:57:32,528 --> 00:57:34,860
- Sometimes you got to coax it down.
- Right.

1161
00:57:34,930 --> 00:57:36,830
Give my sphincter
a little pep talk. Excuse me.

1162
00:57:36,899 --> 00:57:38,833
Come on down, you.

1163
00:57:38,901 --> 00:57:40,926
<i>- Oh, my G...</i>
- I gotta stay in here with you.

1164
00:57:41,003 --> 00:57:44,166
Let me get the window open. Don't
do nothing till I get the window open.

1165
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,470
- Uh-oh!
- The window only opens a little bit.

1166
00:57:46,542 --> 00:57:48,533
- That's not going to be enough.
<i>- [Breaking Wind]</i>

1167
00:57:48,611 --> 00:57:51,842
Oh, hey, hey! You're doing it,
aren't you? Wow!

1168
00:57:51,914 --> 00:57:53,882
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
<i>- [Breaking Wind]</i>

1169
00:57:53,949 --> 00:57:55,883
- It's worse than I imagined.
- [Breaking Wind] Whoo!

1170
00:57:55,951 --> 00:57:58,943
<i>- [Breaking Wind]</i>
- Ohh! Ohh! Oh, Archie!

1171
00:57:59,021 --> 00:58:02,889
<i>You just had ice cream?
That's not just ice cream.</i>

1172
00:58:02,958 --> 00:58:04,892
<i>- Oh, Archie!
- [Breaks Wind]</i>

1173
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,986
Oh, it ain't that bad.
Come on. Whoo!

1174
00:58:08,063 --> 00:58:10,998
<i>[Toilet Flushing]</i>

1175
00:58:11,066 --> 00:58:13,330
Gentlemen, uh, no deal.

1176
00:58:13,402 --> 00:58:15,666
Thanks for your time.

1177
00:58:17,473 --> 00:58:19,464
[Sniffs]

1178
00:58:20,576 --> 00:58:25,844
[Snores]
Hmm! Is that me?

1179
00:58:25,948 --> 00:58:27,848
<i>[ Maya]
Can you hear me?</i>

1180
00:58:27,916 --> 00:58:30,283
<i>[Pepito] Stop staring at me.
You're giving me a complex.</i>

1181
00:58:30,352 --> 00:58:33,083
<i>- I'm trying to blend.
- Well, if you can hear me,</i>

1182
00:58:33,155 --> 00:58:35,920
- can you change to the color of this table...
- What do you think you're doing?

1183
00:58:35,991 --> 00:58:38,983
- I think he understands me.
- Well, if he understood me,

1184
00:58:39,061 --> 00:58:41,587
I'd tell him how sick I am
of all these stupid animals.

1185
00:58:41,664 --> 00:58:43,597
[Gasps]
Oh, that really hurt.

1186
00:58:43,665 --> 00:58:46,691
If you could understand me, I'd tell you
to do something about your dandruff.

1187
00:58:46,768 --> 00:58:48,702
It's looking like
Christmas in July.

1188
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:50,738
I hate this place.

1189
00:58:50,805 --> 00:58:54,571
So young. So angry.
Damn that rap music.

1190
00:58:55,777 --> 00:58:58,542
<i>- [Lisa] Hey.</i>
- Hey.

1191
00:58:58,613 --> 00:59:01,207
So how'd it go?

1192
00:59:01,282 --> 00:59:03,580
Well, I told Potter no deal.

1193
00:59:03,651 --> 00:59:05,619
I thought it wasn't
working with Archie.

1194
00:59:05,687 --> 00:59:08,952
Archie thinks he can win Ava over.
I'm gonna see this through.

1195
00:59:09,023 --> 00:59:12,516
So that means
we're stuck here? Oh!

1196
00:59:12,593 --> 00:59:16,086
- Charisse.
- Hey, Charisse. Hey.

1197
00:59:16,164 --> 00:59:19,361
Charisse. Hey, it's a long walk
back to the city.

1198
00:59:19,434 --> 00:59:21,960
Hey, we're not gettin'
along too good, are we?

1199
00:59:22,036 --> 00:59:24,630
- I wanna go home.
- I wanna go home too. We're going home.

1200
00:59:24,706 --> 00:59:26,640
But there's something else
that's bothering you, isn't it?

1201
00:59:26,708 --> 00:59:28,699
I'm not saying it's all your fault.
Maybe it's my fault.

1202
00:59:28,776 --> 00:59:31,711
Maybe it's a phase you're going through.
But something's bothering you.

1203
00:59:31,779 --> 00:59:34,680
Your mother thinks you got a problem,
and you're not telling us about it.

1204
00:59:34,749 --> 00:59:37,810
- No.
- There's nothing bothering you?

1205
00:59:37,885 --> 00:59:40,054
- I'm sure.
- Charisse.

1206
00:59:40,054 --> 00:59:40,077
- I'm sure.
- Charisse.

1207
00:59:40,188 --> 00:59:42,623
- I'm fine, Dad.
- Okay, now.

1208
00:59:42,690 --> 00:59:45,921
I'm not saying you have a problem,
but if you do we always work things out.

1209
00:59:45,993 --> 00:59:47,825
- Right?
- Right.

1210
00:59:47,895 --> 00:59:49,920
- You're cool?
- Cool.

1211
00:59:49,997 --> 00:59:51,931
All right.

1212
00:59:51,999 --> 00:59:54,730
'Cause your mother was
a little worried. And I was startin'-

1213
00:59:54,802 --> 00:59:57,533
- Tell her I'm fine.
- Okay. Okay.

1214
00:59:57,605 --> 00:59:59,596
Yeah.

1215
01:00:07,382 --> 01:00:10,249
- Dad?
- Yes? Yes?

1216
01:00:10,318 --> 01:00:12,252
I knew something was bothering you.
What is it?

1217
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:15,847
Come on, talk to me.
You know, daddy to daughter.

1218
01:00:15,923 --> 01:00:19,655
Break it down. You can cry, whatever.
We can cry together, if that's-

1219
01:00:19,727 --> 01:00:23,357
- What is it? Stop.
- Nothing.

1220
01:00:23,431 --> 01:00:28,062
It must be the mountains
messing me up, 'cause I'm fine.

1221
01:00:28,136 --> 01:00:30,696
- You sure you're all right?
- Mm-hmm.

1222
01:00:32,807 --> 01:00:34,832
[Giggles]

1223
01:00:37,412 --> 01:00:39,346
She's all right!

1224
01:00:39,414 --> 01:00:42,076
You have your little space.
I'll be in the house.

1225
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:44,278
- All right.
- Okay.

1226
01:00:50,258 --> 01:00:55,287
Talking time's done.
It's time to be bold... for Ava.

1227
01:00:55,363 --> 01:00:58,492
He's goin' after the hive!
He's goin' after the hive!

1228
01:00:58,566 --> 01:01:00,398
- Who?
- Archie.

1229
01:01:00,468 --> 01:01:03,301
- Who?
- Archie, you idiot. Jeez!

1230
01:01:03,371 --> 01:01:07,865
Boy, this cliff's
a lot higher than I remember.

1231
01:01:07,942 --> 01:01:10,172
Bye-bye, species.

1232
01:01:10,244 --> 01:01:14,043
So this is your big plan? Archie, you
get back here right now! Come back in!

1233
01:01:14,114 --> 01:01:17,345
No way, Doc.
I'm gonna do this or die trying.

1234
01:01:17,417 --> 01:01:21,081
- That bear is one bad mother.
- Archie, what are you doing?

1235
01:01:21,154 --> 01:01:23,316
Archie, you get back in here
right now. Stop playing!

1236
01:01:23,390 --> 01:01:27,156
I don't think I'm gonna win Ava
by eating a bunch of worms.

1237
01:01:27,227 --> 01:01:29,218
<i>I'm never gonna be
more woodsy than Sonny.</i>

1238
01:01:29,296 --> 01:01:31,492
I have to show her
how much she means to me.

1239
01:01:31,565 --> 01:01:34,728
And if you fall, it's gonna prove that
you're stupid and dead, Archie.

1240
01:01:34,801 --> 01:01:38,704
What's goin' on around here?
Oh, circus boy's got a new trick.

1241
01:01:38,772 --> 01:01:41,537
- Quiet, Sonny.
- Okay, I got it. I got it.

1242
01:01:41,608 --> 01:01:44,270
That log ain't gonna hold him.
And I know logs.

1243
01:01:44,344 --> 01:01:47,109
- [Log Creaking]
- Okay! Ohh!

1244
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:49,342
- Don't move, Archie! Don't move!
- Careful! Careful!

1245
01:01:49,416 --> 01:01:52,511
- I'll buy you the honey.
- <i>[Archie] Ooh! Ooh!</i>

1247
01:01:55,255 --> 01:01:58,020
- [Archie] This is not a good idea.
- Archie, get down!

1248
01:01:58,091 --> 01:02:00,458
- I'm fine. Oh, bees!

Get away from me!

- No, no, no! No attack! Hey! Stop!

- Ava, I did it for you!

1263
01:02:42,669 --> 01:02:45,400
Good job, Archie!
Way to go, Archie! All right!

1264

- Woo! Woo! Woo!

- That kid's got moxie. I love him.

Okay. Okay, what's
the matter with you, huh?

1267
01:02:55,882 --> 01:02:58,852
<i>What'd you do something
like that for, huh? Are you crazy?</i>

1268
01:02:58,919 --> 01:03:02,184
I could have got that hive if I wanted
it. Come on, Ava, before I get mad.

1269
01:03:02,255 --> 01:03:05,919
Sonny, we're not working out.
So, take a hike.

1270

- Honey?
- Yeah, babe, what's up?

1271
01:03:10,330 --> 01:03:12,424
No. I meant, would you
like more honey?

- Oh, no. I'm good.
<i>- Okay.</i>

Well, we could talk.
Or you could count to a hundred...

1275
01:03:20,273 --> 01:03:23,800

- Okay. Counting, great.

Come on, focus, focus.
Uh, one-

01:03:32,953 --> 01:03:34,614
- Maybe I should stay in the open.
<i>- One, two,</i>

<i>- Uh, one, two, three, ten...</i>

Uh, five-teen. Okay, 100.

What is it? What happened?

1288
01:04:02,581 --> 01:04:04,572
It's Archie.

1289
01:04:06,318 --> 01:04:08,753
<i>- [Man] Back up, back up.</i>
- Okay, folks, let's move it back now.

1290
01:04:08,821 --> 01:04:12,849
We got a wild animal, coming through.
Wild animal, coming through.

1291
01:04:12,925 --> 01:04:15,553
I know you've all seen
the show <i>When Animals Attack.</i>

1292
01:04:15,628 --> 01:04:18,256
Have you seen <i>When Animals
Wake Up and Attack?</i>

1293
01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:20,697
<i>Now, there's nothing
more dangerous...</i>

1294
01:04:20,766 --> 01:04:23,098
than a half-sedated,
half-unsedated bear.

1295

They have big,
sharp teeth and claws-

1296
01:04:26,171 --> 01:04:28,572
Excuse me. I'm Dr. Dolittle.
What happened in here?

1297
01:04:28,641 --> 01:04:30,735
Well, he broke down
the back door,

1298
01:04:30,809 --> 01:04:33,005
and we found him
ransacking the kitchen.

1299
01:04:33,078 --> 01:04:37,538
I'm sorry, Dr. Dolittle. I was rooting
for you. All right, let's move it out!

1300
01:04:37,616 --> 01:04:40,551
<i>Show's over! Let's go!</i>

1301
01:04:40,619 --> 01:04:43,589
- Hey, Archie, it's me. What happened?
<i>- [Groggy] Hey.</i>

1302
01:04:43,656 --> 01:04:47,615
I was so close, Doc.
They came out of nowhere.

1303
01:04:47,693 --> 01:04:50,321
And I... Are you ready
to save the forest?

<i>[Mumbles]</i>

1305
01:04:52,798 --> 01:04:55,460
The good news is, we're
setting aside ten acres of forest.

1306
01:04:55,534 --> 01:04:59,266
We're calling it the Dr. Dolittle
Wildlife Sanctuary.

1307
01:04:59,338 --> 01:05:01,602
We're very pleased about that.
Ah, speak of the devil.

1308
01:05:01,674 --> 01:05:03,938

- You think you won this thing,

- but you haven't.
- Fine.

1310
01:05:06,011 --> 01:05:08,571
We'll just level your forest
and call it a tie.

1311
01:05:08,647 --> 01:05:11,139
Thanks very much, folks.
That's it for today. Thank you.

01:05:17,222 --> 01:05:20,556
Yeah. We got one problem.
He's a friggin' weasel.

Okay, you know what,
that's Mr. Weasel.

1318

Mr. Weasel, did you see
what happened to the bear?

1319
01:05:32,071 --> 01:05:35,207
Ooh, the big scary bear.
Did I see what happened-

1320
01:05:35,207 --> 01:05:35,230
Ooh, the big scary bear.
Did I see what happened-

<i>- Okay, here's the deal.</i>

offer that into evidence.

- Well, you got any better ideas?
- Well, I-I'll stall for time.

Maybe we'll get
a private investigator.

1329
01:05:55,494 --> 01:05:58,930
Those trucks are ready to roll. They're
taking Archie to a zoo in Mexico.

- Well, what do I have to lose?
- Your reputation.

Your Honor, we admit
it was a setback.

But we would like one more week
to rehabilitate the bear.

Might I suggest perhaps
counsel would like to, uh,

1337

admit the animal
into the Betty Ford clinic.

What if I could prove
the entire thing was a setup?

1340
01:06:32,363 --> 01:06:35,799
That would be a very
serious allegation.

1341
01:06:35,867 --> 01:06:38,564
Do you intend
to present evidence?

1342
01:06:38,636 --> 01:06:41,071

Sir, we have an eyewitness who'll
testify that they heard a gunshot,

01:06:49,046 --> 01:06:50,980
<i>then they saw a truck
backing up to the area...</i>

<i>- Is that witness in the courtroom?</i>

1348

No. Not in the courtroom with us,

I know this-this seems
very unreasonable.

01:07:13,304 --> 01:07:17,104
But I can talk to animals. One of them
did come forward with this information.

a brief recess...

to get a camera.

1359

A couple of weeks now.

1396
01:09:51,227 --> 01:09:53,787
At first, it was kind of fuzzy.

1397
01:09:54,864 --> 01:09:59,233
But, uh, now it's really clear.

1398
01:09:59,302 --> 01:10:02,272
And this is what you've
been keeping from us, right?

1399
01:10:02,339 --> 01:10:04,865
I didn't want to say anything because
I didn't want to become a freak.

You're not going to become

Hey, look. When it started
