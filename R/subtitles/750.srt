1
00:00:49,339 --> 00:00:52,885
<i>Once upon a long time ago,
there was an island...</i>

2
00:00:53,051 --> 00:00:57,394
<i>some Dutch, some Indians
and some beads.</i>

3
00:01:26,396 --> 00:01:30,324
<i>And those beads led to steamboats
and skyscrapers...</i>

4
00:01:30,492 --> 00:01:33,012
<i>Wall Street and electric lights...</i>

5
00:01:33,179 --> 00:01:36,726
<i>newspapers, Ellis Island, the Yankees...</i>

6
00:01:36,891 --> 00:01:39,858
<i>Central Park and the first World's Fair...</i>

7
00:01:40,027 --> 00:01:44,218
<i>Broadway, the Chrysler Building
and Studio 54.</i>

8
00:01:44,381 --> 00:01:47,415
<i>I like to think of that
as New York City B.C:</i>

9
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:48,694
<i>Before Carrie.</i>

10
00:01:50,492 --> 00:01:52,315
Hi, guys.

11
00:01:53,116 --> 00:01:56,564
<i>I arrived on this island
at exactly 3:30 pm...</i>

12
00:01:56,891 --> 00:02:00,689
<i>on Tuesday, June 11th, 1986.</i>

13
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:08,438
Oh. Oh!

14
00:02:08,605 --> 00:02:12,086
Cab! Cab, cab, cab! Taxi! Ca...!

15
00:02:14,622 --> 00:02:16,279
<i>It seems like only yesterday.</i>

16
00:02:16,445 --> 00:02:18,006
Taxi!

17
00:02:18,173 --> 00:02:19,385
Thank you.

18
00:02:24,093 --> 00:02:27,355
<i>The very next year, I met Charlotte.</i>

19
00:02:30,078 --> 00:02:35,163
<i>We were on a subway car at 2 am.
when a homeless man dropped his pants.</i>

20
00:02:46,204 --> 00:02:50,612
<i>Miranda and I met in 1989
at Bloomingdale's.</i>

21
00:02:50,783 --> 00:02:52,723
<i>I was working in the dress department.</i>

22
00:02:52,892 --> 00:02:55,959
<i>She was crying in the changing room.</i>

23
00:02:58,527 --> 00:02:59,900
- Hey.
- Hey.

24
00:03:00,061 --> 00:03:01,337
Hi. How are you?

25
00:03:02,429 --> 00:03:06,937
<i>I met Samantha when she was
bartending at CBGB's.</i>

26
00:03:11,677 --> 00:03:14,842
- Bite me!
- MAN]: My place or yours?

27
00:03:17,215 --> 00:03:19,157
- Hi.
- How are you?

28
00:03:19,327 --> 00:03:21,398
Let's go.

29
00:03:21,566 --> 00:03:22,712
Hi.

30
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:23,990
Ready?

31
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:25,532
<i>Time is a funny thing.</i>

32
00:03:25,695 --> 00:03:29,207
<i>A decade can flash by
in an uneventful second.</i>

33
00:03:30,398 --> 00:03:35,579
<i>And then, in just two years,
monumental things can happen.</i>

34
00:03:36,029 --> 00:03:38,933
<i>Things you couldn't imagine happening
in a million years.</i>

35
00:03:39,103 --> 00:03:41,208
Welcome to Bergdorf Goodman.
May I help you?

36
00:03:41,373 --> 00:03:43,230
Yes, our friend is getting married.

37
00:03:43,392 --> 00:03:46,009
- I never thought I'd see this day.
- You and me both.

38
00:03:46,175 --> 00:03:47,452
Hell just froze over.

39
00:03:47,934 --> 00:03:50,619
- What's the name?
- Oh, Blatch. It's Stanford Blatch.

40
00:03:50,782 --> 00:03:53,946
Actually, I think they're registered
under both names.

41
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:57,917
Her best gay friend
is marrying my best gay friend.

42
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:59,735
- That's wonderful.
- I know.

43
00:03:59,902 --> 00:04:01,909
- Let me get the registry.
- Thanks.

44
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,698
How did this even happen?
I thought they hated each other.

45
00:04:04,863 --> 00:04:08,638
It's like musical chairs. The music stopped
and they were the last two left standing.

46
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,762
When you thought everyone you knew was
too old to get married, here come the gays.

47
00:04:22,494 --> 00:04:27,164
<i>And so, one weekend, we all gathered
at a charming inn in Connecticut...</i>

48
00:04:27,327 --> 00:04:29,465
<i>where the view was breathtaking...</i>

49
00:04:29,632 --> 00:04:31,670
<i>and the wedding was legal.</i>

50
00:04:34,911 --> 00:04:37,016
How's my tie?

51
00:04:40,093 --> 00:04:43,064
- How's my tie?
- Wow.

52
00:04:43,807 --> 00:04:45,848
You didn't tell me you were wearing that.

53
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,344
Well, I am the best man.

54
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,421
Oh, and you need a little help here.

55
00:04:50,592 --> 00:04:54,520
So is a gay wedding shorter or longer
than a straight wedding?

56
00:04:54,688 --> 00:04:57,306
- Why?
- Just wanna know what I'm in for.

57
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,057
Well, I think the marriage ceremony
is about the same...

58
00:05:00,223 --> 00:05:04,217
but I have no idea how long the
sacrificing of the straight men will take.

59
00:05:05,633 --> 00:05:06,776
There you go.

60
00:05:08,768 --> 00:05:10,873
Don't make me look too good.
Gay wedding.

61
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:14,683
Will you please stop referring to this
as a gay wedding?

62
00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:17,270
Well, isn't it a gay wedding?

63
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,307
Well, yes, but it's not just a gay wedding.

64
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,073
It's Stanford and Anthony's wedding.

65
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,410
- Mm. Got it.
- Mm-hm.

66
00:05:26,465 --> 00:05:29,334
Whoops. Your fly is down.

67
00:05:30,338 --> 00:05:32,890
Better let me.
These things can be tricky.

68
00:05:34,848 --> 00:05:37,053
You did not pull it up.

69
00:05:38,145 --> 00:05:41,046
I have to be there in an hour.
I'm the best man.

70
00:05:41,568 --> 00:05:43,325
Then I better do my best.

71
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,528
Don't wanna be late
to my first gay wedding.

72
00:05:45,697 --> 00:05:47,672
This is not a gay wedding.

73
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,434
Wasting time talking.

74
00:05:56,737 --> 00:05:59,388
Oh, come on, you're not gonna.

75
00:05:59,554 --> 00:06:03,806
<i> If ever I would leave you</i>

76
00:06:03,967 --> 00:06:08,279
 It wouldn't be in summer

77
00:06:08,448 --> 00:06:11,711
 Seeing you in summer

78
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,556
Okay, it's a gay wedding.

79
00:06:16,673 --> 00:06:20,944
 Your hair streaked with sunlight

80
00:06:20,945 --> 00:06:22,208
 Your lips red as...

81
00:06:22,209 --> 00:06:23,256
Hey.

82
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:24,951
- Hey.
- Hello.

83
00:06:25,762 --> 00:06:27,736
- White enough?
- This is what it looks like...

84
00:06:27,904 --> 00:06:29,760
when you stare directly into the sun.

85
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:31,614
Well, I think it's beautiful.

86
00:06:31,779 --> 00:06:34,625
Oh, this wedding is way more
than beautiful.

87
00:06:34,784 --> 00:06:35,769
It's Lady Di.

88
00:06:36,962 --> 00:06:39,812
- Mommy, can I go look at the swans?
- Yes, honey.

89
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:41,945
Sure, baby.
Stay where we can see you, okay?

90
00:06:42,113 --> 00:06:43,522
- Right there.
- Hi, swans.

91
00:06:43,683 --> 00:06:46,911
- Oh, there's Samantha. Hey.
- You brought your dog?

92
00:06:47,072 --> 00:06:50,815
It's a gay wedding. I figured, what's
one more little bitch with an attitude?

93
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:53,050
You guys, shouldn't we be
a little bit more PC?

94
00:06:53,761 --> 00:06:54,743
Char!

95
00:06:54,913 --> 00:06:55,894
Anthony! Hey.

96
00:06:56,064 --> 00:06:57,308
Can you believe this place?

97
00:06:57,474 --> 00:07:00,025
It looks like the Snow Queen exploded.

98
00:07:00,448 --> 00:07:01,857
- How's that for PC?
- True.

99
00:07:02,018 --> 00:07:04,188
So you're not the wedding planner?

100
00:07:04,354 --> 00:07:07,386
Hell to the no. I pulled out
when Stanford mentioned swans.

101
00:07:07,811 --> 00:07:11,520
Finally, I just threw up my arms,
whatever he wants, give it to him.

102
00:07:11,683 --> 00:07:12,631
Aw.

103
00:07:12,802 --> 00:07:15,519
Yep, Stanford gets the wedding
of his dreams and I get to cheat.

104
00:07:17,026 --> 00:07:18,554
And don't give me that face, Char.

105
00:07:18,722 --> 00:07:22,138
Just because I'm getting married doesn't
mean I have to change who I am.

106
00:07:22,306 --> 00:07:24,542
So you're allowed to cheat
because you're gay?

107
00:07:24,706 --> 00:07:25,787
No, because I'm Italian.

108
00:07:27,266 --> 00:07:28,892
Carrie, Stanford's looking for you.

109
00:07:29,058 --> 00:07:30,171
Cute hat.

110
00:07:30,338 --> 00:07:31,516
- Anthony.
- Coming.

111
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:34,049
I don't get it.
Why get married if you're gonna cheat?

112
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:37,985
Well, he didn't say he was going to cheat,
he just said he was allowed to cheat.

113
00:07:38,148 --> 00:07:39,293
Is that how you heard it?

114
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,168
- Well, it's not really any of our business.
- Except, he told us.

115
00:07:43,331 --> 00:07:47,553
I'm just saying, I think every couple
has the right to make their own rules.

116
00:07:47,714 --> 00:07:50,170
Well, not really. It's marriage.

117
00:07:51,844 --> 00:07:54,047
- Hey, who wants a cocktail?
- Oh, I do.

118
00:07:54,211 --> 00:07:56,763
And see if they have any food.
I need a little nosh.

119
00:07:56,932 --> 00:07:59,780
Eight years later, she's finally a Jew.

120
00:08:05,186 --> 00:08:09,278
<i> There were bells on a hill</i>

121
00:08:09,442 --> 00:08:12,989
Oh, Stanny. You're wearing white.

122
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,393
Like a virgin.

123
00:08:14,564 --> 00:08:16,702
Touched for the very first time.

124
00:08:18,018 --> 00:08:19,448
Hi.

125
00:08:21,187 --> 00:08:22,780
So, what do you think of everything?

126
00:08:22,946 --> 00:08:24,091
You have swans.

127
00:08:24,996 --> 00:08:27,712
- Too much?
- When are swans ever too much?

128
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,697
I don't know what came over me.

129
00:08:29,858 --> 00:08:31,649
Remember that summer
when I got hooked on coke?

130
00:08:31,813 --> 00:08:33,273
- Mm.
- This was like that.

131
00:08:33,442 --> 00:08:35,232
Well, you dropped quite a bundle.

132
00:08:35,619 --> 00:08:38,816
Well, I've been saving for this day
since I was 19.

133
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:40,867
You always knew you
were gonna get married?

134
00:08:41,027 --> 00:08:44,572
Yes. I just thought it would be
to a chubby, patient Jewish girl.

135
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:49,215
FYI, Anthony's out there telling people
he's allowed to cheat.

136
00:08:49,794 --> 00:08:50,843
I know.

137
00:08:51,012 --> 00:08:54,109
He hates the tradition
so he pushes against it.

138
00:08:55,363 --> 00:08:56,574
So he is allowed to cheat?

139
00:08:56,738 --> 00:08:59,905
Yes, but only in the 45 states where
we're not legally married.

140
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,394
Okay, now you do mine.

141
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:06,778
"Carrie Preston"?

142
00:09:08,484 --> 00:09:09,531
What?

143
00:09:10,662 --> 00:09:14,621
Nothing, I'm just surprised not
to be "Bradshaw" at your wedding.

144
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:20,671
The wedding planner said that couples
are always listed under their married names.

145
00:09:20,835 --> 00:09:22,330
Oh, that makes sense.

146
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,996
Are you taking Anthony's name?

147
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:26,106
No. We're guys.

148
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:30,106
"Guys"? Have you seen yourself
in the mirror, Lady Dior?

149
00:09:31,587 --> 00:09:33,116
Bitch.

150
00:09:33,923 --> 00:09:36,991
- Hey, did anybody send up my, um...?
- Oh.

151
00:09:37,988 --> 00:09:40,955
Now, the boutonniere may say "Preston".

152
00:09:41,891 --> 00:09:43,868
But the hat...

153
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,895
says "Bradshaw".

154
00:09:56,645 --> 00:09:59,580
 Sunrise, sunset

155
00:09:59,749 --> 00:10:02,498
 Sunrise, sunset

156
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:08,824
 Swiftly flow the days

157
00:10:09,092 --> 00:10:15,617
 Seedlings turn overnight
To sunflowers

158
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:21,978
 Blossoming even as we gaze

159
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:25,052
 Sunrise, sunset

160
00:10:25,222 --> 00:10:27,458
Who's that hot straight guy with Carrie?

161
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:30,785
- That's Anthony's brother, Nicky.
- How can you tell that he's straight?

162
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,737
It's a gift.

163
00:10:43,846 --> 00:10:46,562
Could this wedding get any gayer?

164
00:10:48,388 --> 00:10:49,915
Look who's marrying them.

165
00:10:50,565 --> 00:10:51,711
Oh, my...

166
00:10:51,729 --> 00:10:54,306
 Sunrise, sunset

167
00:10:54,469 --> 00:10:56,162
Why would Liza say yes to this?

168
00:10:56,324 --> 00:10:57,405
It's a law of physics.

169
00:10:57,573 --> 00:11:01,664
Any time there's this much gay energy
in one room, Liza manifests.

170
00:11:03,398 --> 00:11:06,659
 Another

171
00:11:07,077 --> 00:11:10,591
 Laden with happiness

172
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:15,494
 And tears

173
00:11:18,918 --> 00:11:20,104
<i>A little while later,</i>

174
00:11:20,105 --> 00:11:23,805
it was time for Stanford and Anthony
to exchange vows.

175
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:29,601
And now, the brooms have written
their own v... "Brooms"?

176
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,811
Bride, groom. Broom.

177
00:11:31,975 --> 00:11:35,106
Oh, broom. Oh, that's marvelous.

178
00:11:35,686 --> 00:11:37,857
Thank you, Liza Minnelli.

179
00:11:39,815 --> 00:11:41,091
Quiet, now.

180
00:11:41,254 --> 00:11:42,717
Weddings are serious.

181
00:11:43,656 --> 00:11:45,989
At least that's what I've heard.

182
00:11:51,528 --> 00:11:54,079
"It was not exactly love at first sight.

183
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,180
But it turns out, it was love.

184
00:12:02,792 --> 00:12:06,304
You are the first man to accept me...

185
00:12:09,734 --> 00:12:12,484
for the man that I actually am".

186
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:15,677
<i>That's the thing about tradition.</i>

187
00:12:15,848 --> 00:12:18,915
<i>Like it or not, it sneaks in.</i>

188
00:12:19,911 --> 00:12:21,885
Mazeltov!

189
00:12:22,695 --> 00:12:24,932
Congratulations.

190
00:12:30,087 --> 00:12:32,508
-  All the single ladies
-  All the single ladies

191
00:12:32,678 --> 00:12:34,784
<i>-  All the single ladies
-  All the single ladies</i>

192
00:12:34,951 --> 00:12:37,289
 All the single ladies
Now put your hands up

193
00:12:37,767 --> 00:12:39,524
 Up in the club
We just broke up

194
00:12:39,689 --> 00:12:41,957
 I'm doing my own little thing

195
00:12:42,118 --> 00:12:44,486
 You decided to dip
But now you wanna trip

196
00:12:44,647 --> 00:12:47,298
 'Cause another guy noticed me

197
00:12:47,463 --> 00:12:49,318
 I'm up on him
He's up on me

198
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:51,684
 Don't pay him any attention

199
00:12:51,847 --> 00:12:54,019
 Cried my tears
Three good years

200
00:12:54,183 --> 00:12:56,420
 Can't be mad at me

201
00:12:56,582 --> 00:12:58,886
 'Cause if you liked it
Then you should've put a ring on it

202
00:12:59,049 --> 00:13:01,186
 If you liked it
Then you should've put a ring on it

203
00:13:01,352 --> 00:13:03,655
 Don't be mad
Once you see that he wants it

204
00:13:03,815 --> 00:13:06,019
 If you liked it
Then you should've put a ring on it

205
00:13:06,184 --> 00:13:07,777
 Whoa, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

206
00:13:07,944 --> 00:13:10,562
 Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

207
00:13:10,728 --> 00:13:13,182
 Whoa, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

208
00:13:13,352 --> 00:13:15,740
 Whoa, oh
Oh, oh, oh

209
00:13:15,913 --> 00:13:20,547
 Don't treat me to the things
Of the world

210
00:13:20,712 --> 00:13:22,469
 I'm not that kind of girl

211
00:13:22,633 --> 00:13:24,704
Hey. How's everything?

212
00:13:24,872 --> 00:13:26,597
Fine. Rose is giving her a hard time.

213
00:13:26,953 --> 00:13:28,197
Should I go up to the room?

214
00:13:28,361 --> 00:13:31,207
What was the point of bringing
the nanny out here, then?

215
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,298
Is everything okay?

216
00:13:32,299 --> 00:13:34,699
Yeah, Rose is just driving us
a little crazy.

217
00:13:34,761 --> 00:13:39,134
No, not crazy. She's just a little fussy.
Everything's fine.

218
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,539
<i> If you don't you'll be alone</i>

219
00:13:41,704 --> 00:13:48,033
 And like a ghost I'll be gone

220
00:13:48,201 --> 00:13:50,339
 If you liked it
Then you should've put a ring on it

221
00:13:50,505 --> 00:13:52,741
 If you liked it
Then you should've put a ring on it

222
00:13:52,905 --> 00:13:55,207
 Don't be mad
Once you see that he wants it

223
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:57,921
 If you liked it
Then you should've put a ring on it

224
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:00,000
 If you liked it
Then you should've put a ring on it

225
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,339
 If you liked it
Then you should've put a ring on it

226
00:14:02,506 --> 00:14:04,708
 Don't be mad
Once you see that he wants it

227
00:14:04,872 --> 00:14:07,808
 If you liked it
Then you should've put a ring

228
00:14:07,977 --> 00:14:13,889
 Oh, ohh, ohhhh

229
00:14:14,057 --> 00:14:15,618
Good luck.

230
00:14:23,882 --> 00:14:25,541
Now I know why we got married.

231
00:14:25,704 --> 00:14:28,193
So we wouldn't have to dance
to that song at weddings.

232
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,295
That the only reason?

233
00:14:31,755 --> 00:14:32,735
Yeah.

234
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:37,990
- I have to try on your crown.
- Oh, you have to.

235
00:14:39,305 --> 00:14:40,645
I'm sorry.

236
00:14:40,809 --> 00:14:43,941
- Hey, I'm kissing here.
- I have to. It's from him.

237
00:14:44,105 --> 00:14:46,441
It's Saturday. You're at a wedding.

238
00:14:46,602 --> 00:14:48,161
Did I mention that he hates me?

239
00:14:48,331 --> 00:14:50,020
Who would dare hate you?

240
00:14:50,186 --> 00:14:54,309
The new senior law partner at her firm.
He rides her ass nonstop.

241
00:14:54,474 --> 00:14:55,784
- Why?
- No idea.

242
00:14:55,945 --> 00:14:57,985
It's like he can't stand the sound
of my voice.

243
00:14:58,153 --> 00:15:00,639
Every time I open my mouth,
he shuts me down.

244
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:03,461
Sometimes he holds his hand up like this:

245
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:06,791
- Ew!
- Yeah. He hates me less over e-mail.

246
00:15:08,905 --> 00:15:10,531
How's it going?

247
00:15:10,698 --> 00:15:13,568
Good. Thanks.

248
00:15:13,897 --> 00:15:15,207
Enjoy.

249
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,353
You have a nice night.

250
00:15:16,809 --> 00:15:17,955
You have a nice night.

251
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,916
- Thank you.
- A guy just hit on me.

252
00:15:35,082 --> 00:15:36,674
Really?

253
00:15:37,131 --> 00:15:39,270
How's it make you feel?

254
00:15:39,723 --> 00:15:41,544
Like I still got it.

255
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,528
You most certainly do.

256
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:46,277
- So sorry to bother you. I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

257
00:15:46,443 --> 00:15:48,265
- I'm so sorry to bother you.
- It's okay.

258
00:15:48,427 --> 00:15:51,776
I've just been reading your books
for years and your column.

259
00:15:51,948 --> 00:15:54,630
I swear,
we had the exact same dating life.

260
00:15:54,795 --> 00:15:56,998
- Wow.
- Cut to the chase, Ellen.

261
00:15:57,162 --> 00:15:58,275
She means she is you.

262
00:15:58,443 --> 00:16:00,036
I am. I am you.

263
00:16:00,744 --> 00:16:04,706
Well, in that case, may I introduce
you to your husband, John James Preston.

264
00:16:04,874 --> 00:16:06,085
- Hi.
- Good to meet you.

265
00:16:06,251 --> 00:16:08,007
- Hey.
- How long have you been married?

266
00:16:09,258 --> 00:16:12,074
Well, it'll be two years next month.

267
00:16:12,235 --> 00:16:14,405
We're married two years next month
as well.

268
00:16:14,571 --> 00:16:16,806
- Wow. You are me.
- I guess.

269
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:20,233
We're expecting a baby, and get this:
the due date is our anniversary.

270
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:24,552
Well, I'm not pregnant.
Well, I guess that's obvious.

271
00:16:24,714 --> 00:16:26,985
- Surrogate.
- Wow. Congratulations.

272
00:16:27,148 --> 00:16:28,578
You guys have kids?

273
00:16:28,745 --> 00:16:31,081
If you need a surrogate service,
ours was flawless.

274
00:16:31,245 --> 00:16:35,040
Oh, no, thanks. It's not a surrogate
situation. We're just not having children.

275
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:36,800
You don't want kids?

276
00:16:36,971 --> 00:16:38,761
Well, no, we love them.

277
00:16:38,925 --> 00:16:40,266
It's just not for us.

278
00:16:41,354 --> 00:16:44,933
So it's going to be just...

279
00:16:45,099 --> 00:16:46,082
you two?

280
00:16:48,268 --> 00:16:51,138
Uh, but she does have a new book
coming out next month.

281
00:16:51,755 --> 00:16:53,764
Great. Great. And what's that about?

282
00:16:54,284 --> 00:16:55,560
Marriage.

283
00:16:57,132 --> 00:16:58,692
Well...

284
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,898
Have a nice night.

285
00:17:07,147 --> 00:17:09,864
And all this time I thought Samantha
was my publicist.

286
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:13,377
I had to say something. She looked like
someone told her there was no Santa.

287
00:17:13,548 --> 00:17:16,004
May I have your attention, please?

288
00:17:16,172 --> 00:17:21,606
My son and his husband would like to ask
all couples to join them on the dance floor.

289
00:17:21,772 --> 00:17:23,299
Oh, that's very nice, dear.

290
00:17:23,468 --> 00:17:24,896
Ohhh.

291
00:17:26,476 --> 00:17:29,127
You're done. We're going to dance.

292
00:17:29,868 --> 00:17:32,324
Fake to the right. Nice.

293
00:17:34,284 --> 00:17:38,441
I'm done. I'm done. I'm done!

294
00:17:38,605 --> 00:17:40,328
Dance me.

295
00:17:41,003 --> 00:17:43,394
May I have the honor, Mrs. Goldenblatt?

296
00:17:43,565 --> 00:17:45,354
You most certainly may.

297
00:17:45,516 --> 00:17:46,597
<i> Sad sensation</i>

298
00:17:46,764 --> 00:17:48,587
 Lately I've not slept a wink

299
00:17:48,748 --> 00:17:51,204
- Come on, honey.
- Come on, sweetie.

300
00:17:51,374 --> 00:17:53,346
Let's go dance.

301
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:57,026
Care to dance?

302
00:17:57,388 --> 00:17:59,397
Just us two?

303
00:18:02,668 --> 00:18:04,772
Samantha, you look amazing.

304
00:18:04,939 --> 00:18:07,430
Oh, yes, you do.
What have you had done?

305
00:18:07,596 --> 00:18:11,209
Nothing. I'm 100 percent natural.

306
00:18:11,853 --> 00:18:13,641
I'm serious. I need names.

307
00:18:19,054 --> 00:18:21,835
- Gentlemen.
- I heard that.

308
00:18:27,438 --> 00:18:30,121
You looked pretty hot out there before.
Wanna dance again?

309
00:18:30,284 --> 00:18:34,083
I can think of so many other more
fun things I'd rather do with you.

310
00:18:36,111 --> 00:18:38,019
- I'm Nicky.
- Samantha.

311
00:18:38,188 --> 00:18:39,618
Nice to meet you, Samantha.

312
00:18:40,655 --> 00:18:42,410
What do you do for a living, Nicky?

313
00:18:42,733 --> 00:18:43,716
I lay concrete.

314
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,866
That sounds promising.

315
00:18:46,477 --> 00:18:48,780
- Yeah. Yeah!
- Yeah!

316
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,217
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

317
00:18:50,381 --> 00:18:52,204
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

318
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:53,543
- Yeah!
- What the...?

319
00:18:54,285 --> 00:18:55,333
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

320
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:56,550
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

321
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:59,086
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

322
00:19:08,334 --> 00:19:10,603
CHARLOTTE: Rose, come on, now.
Come on, now. Sleepy time.

323
00:19:10,765 --> 00:19:12,196
Rose. Come on.

324
00:19:12,365 --> 00:19:14,732
Rose, Rose, Rose.

325
00:19:14,894 --> 00:19:16,487
- Please?
- Good. Good. Here?

326
00:19:16,654 --> 00:19:18,214
Let's go sleepy.

327
00:19:18,381 --> 00:19:19,843
Please, Rose?

328
00:19:20,016 --> 00:19:22,217
Come on, come on.

329
00:19:26,414 --> 00:19:27,755
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

330
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:29,127
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

331
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:31,083
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

332
00:19:32,908 --> 00:19:34,982
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

333
00:19:35,151 --> 00:19:37,867
- I don't know which is worse.
- Samantha.

334
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,749
The baby will tire eventually.

335
00:19:41,262 --> 00:19:42,920
Let's get a little white noise.

336
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:50,126
<i>Right from your home.
Amnesty International.</i>

337
00:19:50,285 --> 00:19:51,847
<i>Visit any location. Lumber Liquid...</i>

338
00:19:52,014 --> 00:19:54,282
<i>Where do you want to...?</i>

339
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,456
<i>- Jackpot.
- Do you mind if I try?</i>

340
00:19:56,624 --> 00:19:58,598
A little black-and-white noise.

341
00:20:00,015 --> 00:20:01,901
<i>It Happened One Night.</i>

342
00:20:02,062 --> 00:20:03,688
CARRIE:
Never seen it.

343
00:20:03,855 --> 00:20:07,205
Well, kid, you are in for a treat.

344
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:09,545
Climb up in here.

345
00:20:10,702 --> 00:20:12,329
<i>What are you gonna do?</i>

346
00:20:12,495 --> 00:20:14,796
<i>A system all my own.</i>

347
00:20:21,968 --> 00:20:23,495
Oh, that's shocking.

348
00:20:23,663 --> 00:20:24,646
For the '30s, it was.

349
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:30,444
Did you see it when it opened originally?

350
00:20:33,807 --> 00:20:35,717
<i>Aren't you going to give me
a little credit?</i>

351
00:20:35,886 --> 00:20:37,675
She's pretty.

352
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,390
She's got nothing on you.

353
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:42,985
<i>There Big and I were...</i>

354
00:20:43,663 --> 00:20:47,940
<i>somewhere between wild sex
and a baby.</i>

355
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:52,361
- Hey, you.
- Hey, how are you?

356
00:20:54,895 --> 00:20:57,383
- Hi, guys.
- How are you?

357
00:21:00,337 --> 00:21:01,960
Thanks.

358
00:21:02,542 --> 00:21:04,847
- Ready to order?
- Um, I think we'll wait for our friend.

359
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:05,990
- Okay. Yup.
- Thanks.

360
00:21:06,061 --> 00:21:07,990
<i>Okay. Yeah,
that sounds great. Yeah.</i>

361
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,255
That's a whole lotta help.

362
00:21:09,256 --> 00:21:11,083
- How many are working there?
- Forty-four.

363
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:14,253
I'm on the one-a-day Fruity Pebbles plan.

364
00:21:14,415 --> 00:21:16,805
Women our age shouldn't joke
about vitamins.

365
00:21:16,978 --> 00:21:19,911
Women who are not our age shouldn't
say "women our age".

366
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,894
- Yeah.
- Well, one day very soon you will thank me.

367
00:21:23,056 --> 00:21:25,325
I am leading the way
through the menopause maze.

368
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:29,934
With my vitamins, my melatonin sleep
patches, my bioidentical estrogen cream...

369
00:21:30,096 --> 00:21:32,847
progesterone cream,
a touch of testosterone...

370
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,278
- She's the hormone whisperer.
- I am.

371
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,189
I've tricked my body
into thinking it's younger.

372
00:21:38,353 --> 00:21:41,385
I've tricked my body
into thinking it's thinner. Spanx.

373
00:21:41,935 --> 00:21:44,872
And I'm telling you, no hot flashes,
no mood swings...

374
00:21:45,042 --> 00:21:47,855
and my sex drive,
it's right back to where it was.

375
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:51,497
- Really? Hadn't heard.
- Where are you getting your information?

376
00:21:51,665 --> 00:21:54,632
From Suzanne Somers
and her team of doctors.

377
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,688
I'll get you a copy. It's a revelation.

378
00:21:56,849 --> 00:22:00,198
You're taking medical advice from
the woman who invented the ThighMaster?

379
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:02,310
Damn right. Have you seen my thighs?

380
00:22:02,479 --> 00:22:04,237
Okay, go ahead, laugh. It's working.

381
00:22:04,402 --> 00:22:07,751
By the time you ladies are 50, I'll be 35.

382
00:22:08,337 --> 00:22:10,671
- Take Mommy's hand.
- Oh, here she is.

383
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:12,906
I thought it was just gonna be
the four of us.

384
00:22:13,075 --> 00:22:14,666
Don't worry, the nanny will be here.

385
00:22:14,832 --> 00:22:16,906
Harry's just not back from playing golf.

386
00:22:17,074 --> 00:22:18,250
Oh, here.

387
00:22:18,418 --> 00:22:20,327
Let me hold that pretty
little morning Rose.

388
00:22:20,498 --> 00:22:22,024
- No. No.
- Okay, no sale.

389
00:22:22,544 --> 00:22:24,269
She just learned the word "no".

390
00:22:24,434 --> 00:22:27,303
Good for her. We're hoping Samantha
learns it one of these days.

391
00:22:27,475 --> 00:22:29,260
- Terrible twos.
- She's not terrible.

392
00:22:29,424 --> 00:22:32,360
No, of course, she's not terrible.
The terrible twos are terrible.

393
00:22:32,531 --> 00:22:33,643
Right.

394
00:22:34,226 --> 00:22:36,331
She's in the "I only want Mommy" phase.

395
00:22:36,497 --> 00:22:37,478
And me and Erin.

396
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:40,650
That's right. Just you and me and Erin.

397
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:43,404
- Who's Erin?
- Her nanny.

398
00:22:43,569 --> 00:22:45,259
How are you gonna swallow all those?

399
00:22:45,424 --> 00:22:46,734
Have we met?

400
00:22:48,306 --> 00:22:49,963
Erin!

401
00:23:03,346 --> 00:23:05,136
- Good morning, ladies.
- Morning.

402
00:23:05,297 --> 00:23:07,786
I hear it was quite the glorious wedding.

403
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:10,094
It was.

404
00:23:10,258 --> 00:23:12,397
Oh, and you must be
the famous Samantha.

405
00:23:12,563 --> 00:23:14,766
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

406
00:23:14,928 --> 00:23:17,449
Now, I know a little girl...

407
00:23:17,617 --> 00:23:21,199
who would just love to practice
her cartwheels on the lawn.

408
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,791
- Yay.
- Yay.

409
00:23:23,699 --> 00:23:25,161
Do you have the sunblock?

410
00:23:25,874 --> 00:23:27,369
Come to me, you little pet.

411
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:28,815
There you go.

412
00:23:29,265 --> 00:23:32,201
- Yes.
- You have yourselves a lovely morning.

413
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,127
- You too.
- Thanks, Erin.

414
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:37,194
- Oh, that is so sweet.
- I know.

415
00:23:37,937 --> 00:23:38,985
That's your nanny?

416
00:23:39,154 --> 00:23:40,399
Yes, that's Erin.

417
00:23:40,563 --> 00:23:41,991
You mean Erin Go Braless.

418
00:23:42,161 --> 00:23:44,813
Ha, ha. She doesn't wear a bra.

419
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,882
Was she wearing a bra
at the job interview?

420
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:48,150
I don't know, Samantha...

421
00:23:48,151 --> 00:23:51,117
I was too busy thinking about her degree
in Children's Education...

422
00:23:51,118 --> 00:23:53,968
- and how much the girls liked her.
- Her tits never came up?

423
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:56,716
No, her tits never came up.

424
00:23:56,883 --> 00:23:59,565
- And she's amazing.
- Well, I'm sure she is.

425
00:23:59,732 --> 00:24:03,626
But, honey, there ought to be a law
against hiring a nanny that looks like that.

426
00:24:03,795 --> 00:24:05,387
Yeah, the Jude Law.

427
00:24:08,371 --> 00:24:10,062
- Are we ready?
- Yes, I think so.

428
00:24:10,226 --> 00:24:11,438
- One, two, three!
- Yeah, go!

429
00:24:12,948 --> 00:24:17,703
That's a good girl! One more time!

430
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:26,179
<i>It seems it wasn't only
the children...</i>

431
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,980
<i>that were captivated
by Charlotte's Irish nanny...</i>

432
00:24:29,044 --> 00:24:31,214
<i>and her lucky charms.</i>

433
00:24:38,547 --> 00:24:42,736
<i>And later that day,
Big and I arrived home.</i>

434
00:24:47,924 --> 00:24:49,833
- Hot in here.
- Yeah.

435
00:24:51,219 --> 00:24:52,628
I'll get the air in the bedroom.

436
00:24:52,789 --> 00:24:54,544
- You get the living room.
- Okay.

437
00:24:54,706 --> 00:24:57,609
<i>After Big and I sold the extravagant
rooftop penthouse...</i>

438
00:24:57,779 --> 00:24:59,603
<i>we thought we were meant to live in...</i>

439
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:03,179
<i>we decided that maybe we needed
to come a little more down to earth.</i>

440
00:25:03,348 --> 00:25:04,329
<i>So we did.</i>

441
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,736
<i>Twelve floors, to be exact.</i>

442
00:25:07,573 --> 00:25:08,914
<i>We may be closer to earth...</i>

443
00:25:12,661 --> 00:25:15,823
<i>but we kept a little bit of heaven.</i>

444
00:25:35,027 --> 00:25:39,088
<i>We've got excellent panels,
some of the best blinds...</i>

445
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:43,438
It's 4:30. Where should
I make reservations? Any cravings?

446
00:25:43,604 --> 00:25:45,841
Don't we have anything to eat here?

447
00:25:46,741 --> 00:25:48,300
Nothing?

448
00:25:48,468 --> 00:25:52,561
<i>Come on. You knew when you married me
I was more Coco Chanel than coq au vin.</i>

449
00:25:52,725 --> 00:25:53,968
Let's just order in.

450
00:25:54,133 --> 00:25:55,759
We ordered in two nights last week.

451
00:25:56,629 --> 00:25:58,122
Well, we've been out all weekend.

452
00:25:59,926 --> 00:26:01,301
Let's just stay home.

453
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,112
Okay.

454
00:26:10,164 --> 00:26:13,512
- That couch is good, right?
- Mm-hm.

455
00:26:13,685 --> 00:26:15,506
Worth the year and a half wait.

456
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:21,171
All we need is a piece for that corner
and we're done.

457
00:26:21,335 --> 00:26:22,674
You did good, kid.

458
00:26:34,901 --> 00:26:37,649
You know you have your shoes
on the couch, right?

459
00:26:38,902 --> 00:26:40,877
Year and a half, I'm just saying.

460
00:26:47,957 --> 00:26:51,252
- That must be the rest of the luggage.
- Oh, good.

461
00:26:52,405 --> 00:26:55,439
For a minute I thought it might be
the shoe police.

462
00:26:58,133 --> 00:27:00,752
<i>And a few mornings later,
in a different home...</i>

463
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,569
Why bring rat into New York house?

464
00:27:03,734 --> 00:27:06,484
So Brady can win the
second grade science fair. Right, B-boy?

465
00:27:06,645 --> 00:27:08,620
Yeah, I'm gonna win.

466
00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:10,993
- Sit down, please, have some breakfast.
- I can't.

467
00:27:11,158 --> 00:27:13,526
I have this presentation
and I'm sick to my stomach.

468
00:27:13,685 --> 00:27:16,620
I used to love going to work
and now I'm sick at the thought of it.

469
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:18,130
Here.

470
00:27:18,294 --> 00:27:19,985
- Two bites.
- Thanks, Magda.

471
00:27:20,151 --> 00:27:22,091
You don't have to put
yourself through this.

472
00:27:22,261 --> 00:27:24,530
I'm a lawyer. That's who I am.

473
00:27:24,694 --> 00:27:27,312
Life's too short.
Go someplace where they appreciate you.

474
00:27:27,478 --> 00:27:30,794
Until you find a better job, you can be home
and help out around the house.

475
00:27:30,965 --> 00:27:33,269
I've waited too long to get here.

476
00:27:33,432 --> 00:27:34,955
I just have to suck it up.

477
00:27:35,126 --> 00:27:36,883
Yeah.

478
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,731
Mom, you gonna come
to the science fair today?

479
00:27:39,893 --> 00:27:42,131
Sorry, honey, she can't.

480
00:27:42,132 --> 00:27:44,332
- Mommy's...
- She has to go to work. Yeah.

481
00:27:47,543 --> 00:27:51,253
We think that these new numbers
show a much more optimistic upside for us.

482
00:27:51,414 --> 00:27:53,456
And the savings that we found
for the client...

483
00:27:53,621 --> 00:27:57,268
will easily make up for any
escalated legal fees that they incur.

484
00:27:57,431 --> 00:27:58,478
So it's win-win.

485
00:27:58,647 --> 00:28:01,168
It's totally win-win, Tom.
And what's more, based on...

486
00:28:01,336 --> 00:28:03,855
Kevin, I'd like you to run
with this from here on.

487
00:28:04,023 --> 00:28:05,267
But it's Miranda's case.

488
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:08,496
Actually, it's the firm's case,
and as senior partner, I'm...

489
00:28:10,262 --> 00:28:11,506
Is there a problem?

490
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,527
I don't know. Is there?

491
00:28:13,687 --> 00:28:15,859
Have something you'd like
to say to me in private?

492
00:28:16,023 --> 00:28:19,405
I don't know that it needs
to be in private.

493
00:28:19,575 --> 00:28:21,551
Okay, and we're all paying attention.

494
00:28:21,718 --> 00:28:26,869
Honorable mention goes to Rachel
for "What is Static Electricity?"

495
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:29,877
- Let's give her a big hand.
- What?

496
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:32,527
- I quit.
- Good for you.

497
00:28:33,718 --> 00:28:35,988
- You okay?
- I'll get another job. A better job.

498
00:28:36,151 --> 00:28:38,573
And I already called the headhunter.
Where's Brady?

499
00:28:38,744 --> 00:28:45,455
Now, our first prize goes to Brady
for his Mouse Maze.

500
00:28:47,832 --> 00:28:49,936
Hey, Mom, I won!

501
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,532
I made it.

502
00:28:51,703 --> 00:28:52,686
I never make it.

503
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,416
- Good work, Brady.
- Good boy.

504
00:28:55,446 --> 00:28:57,999
Your dolphin has got all the skills...

505
00:28:58,168 --> 00:29:00,655
and it's gonna have a little swim
with the crab.

506
00:29:01,336 --> 00:29:03,278
Yes, it is, baby girl.

507
00:29:03,447 --> 00:29:06,318
Hey, cutie, come look.
Now, what does this do here?

508
00:29:06,488 --> 00:29:08,724
Look at this. Well, what is that gonna do?

509
00:29:28,185 --> 00:29:30,835
<i>There can be many tortured moments
in the life of someone...</i>

510
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,756
<i>who spends her
days writing books.</i>

511
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,959
<i>The antidote to those moments...</i>

512
00:29:35,128 --> 00:29:39,602
<i>is the moment the finished book
finally arrives.</i>

513
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,541
- Hello?
- Do I have anything to worry about?

514
00:30:03,705 --> 00:30:07,382
- Can you be more specific?
- I mean with the nanny and Harry.

515
00:30:07,544 --> 00:30:08,689
That's just Samantha.

516
00:30:08,856 --> 00:30:11,061
You're the one who said that thing
about Jude Law.

517
00:30:11,224 --> 00:30:14,999
Oh, sweetie, it was a joke. You know,
it was right there, I had to go for it.

518
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:18,421
<i>- And it was funny.
- No, no, I really wish I hadn't said it.</i>

519
00:30:18,585 --> 00:30:20,658
- Look, Mommy.
- Just a second, honey...

520
00:30:20,825 --> 00:30:23,923
...I just have to finish these cupcakes
for the party tomorrow, okay?

521
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:26,840
- Hey, wait, what was I saying?
- Should you be threatened.

522
00:30:27,001 --> 00:30:28,017
Did I say "threatened"?

523
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:30,097
Uh...

524
00:30:30,265 --> 00:30:31,957
- Should I be threatened?
- Look, Mommy, look.

525
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:34,641
Okay, honey. Let me just put Rose
in her chair. Carrie?

526
00:30:34,811 --> 00:30:36,566
<i>I'm gonna put you down for a second.</i>

527
00:30:36,729 --> 00:30:38,934
I'm gonna put the baby down,
I'll be right back.

528
00:30:40,281 --> 00:30:42,801
- Ooh.
- It's okay. It's okay, sweetheart.

529
00:30:42,969 --> 00:30:45,010
- Oh, I know.
- Look, Mommy, look.

530
00:30:45,178 --> 00:30:46,606
Oh, precious.

531
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:48,339
- Look at me.
- It's okay.

532
00:30:48,921 --> 00:30:51,823
Look. Look.

533
00:30:51,994 --> 00:30:53,139
Okay, I'm listening.

534
00:30:53,307 --> 00:30:57,463
Well, did you have any worries
before the Samantha comment?

535
00:30:57,626 --> 00:30:59,054
No, of course not.

536
00:30:59,225 --> 00:31:02,006
I love Erin and I trust Harry.

537
00:31:02,168 --> 00:31:04,176
I believe you just answered
your own question.

538
00:31:04,347 --> 00:31:06,321
Me, me, me!

539
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:09,011
Lily! This skirt is vintage.

540
00:31:09,851 --> 00:31:12,022
- What skirt?
- It's the cream Valentino.

541
00:31:12,185 --> 00:31:13,974
Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry.

542
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:15,925
I've gotta go!

543
00:31:16,091 --> 00:31:17,520
Lily, look at what you did!

544
00:31:22,618 --> 00:31:25,782
Mommy just has to get something, okay?

545
00:31:33,852 --> 00:31:35,030
Mommy.

546
00:31:35,194 --> 00:31:37,909
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.

547
00:31:39,289 --> 00:31:41,014
Mommy will be out in a minute.

548
00:31:41,179 --> 00:31:43,249
Mommy, Mommy.

549
00:31:43,418 --> 00:31:45,208
Mommy.

550
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,648
I was just getting more sprinkles.

551
00:31:50,811 --> 00:31:51,989
Girls.

552
00:31:52,155 --> 00:31:55,831
Let's go and play in my bedroom.

553
00:31:55,995 --> 00:31:58,198
Mommy needs some cooking time.

554
00:31:58,362 --> 00:32:01,363
<i>Charlotte was thankful
to have Erin come home at that moment.</i>

555
00:32:01,531 --> 00:32:03,986
<i>Threat or no threat.</i>

556
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:05,650
<i>Bra or no bra.</i>

557
00:32:05,819 --> 00:32:07,727
Good. Come on, darling.

558
00:32:08,666 --> 00:32:10,935
<i>And from no bra
on the Upper East Side...</i>

559
00:32:11,099 --> 00:32:12,955
<i>to no panties in Times Square.</i>

560
00:32:13,115 --> 00:32:15,187
It's 12 and your lunch is at 12:30.

561
00:32:15,355 --> 00:32:16,849
I'm just freshening up.

562
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:23,665
Call the restaurant and tell them
I'm going to be 15 minutes late.

563
00:32:23,835 --> 00:32:25,461
Samantha Jones.

564
00:32:28,251 --> 00:32:30,617
Smith Jerrod's on the phone.

565
00:32:35,354 --> 00:32:37,144
Refresh my memory.

566
00:32:37,307 --> 00:32:40,243
- How do we know each other again?
- You used to do my publicity.

567
00:32:40,988 --> 00:32:41,972
Doesn't ring a bell.

568
00:32:44,027 --> 00:32:45,305
You used to do me.

569
00:32:45,821 --> 00:32:47,925
Oh, ding, ding ding.

570
00:32:48,093 --> 00:32:50,262
How's L.A?

571
00:32:50,747 --> 00:32:52,537
I'm in Abu Dhabi.

572
00:32:52,699 --> 00:32:54,106
You're back in the Middle East?

573
00:32:54,268 --> 00:32:56,821
Yeah. We're shooting the poster
for the movie I made here.

574
00:32:56,987 --> 00:33:00,120
And I just found out
that we're premiering in New York.

575
00:33:00,924 --> 00:33:03,673
I'm calling because I want you
on that red carpet next to me.

576
00:33:03,835 --> 00:33:04,883
Smith.

577
00:33:05,212 --> 00:33:07,929
- You do?
- Hell, yeah.

578
00:33:08,699 --> 00:33:10,739
My career never would've happened
without you.

579
00:33:10,908 --> 00:33:12,763
Who else would I take to my big night?

580
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:14,298
That is so sweet.

581
00:33:15,643 --> 00:33:18,741
Oh. Honey? I gotta go.

582
00:33:18,909 --> 00:33:21,527
I'm pulling up my panties
to get to a lunch date.

583
00:33:26,524 --> 00:33:27,866
Not to brag...

584
00:33:28,028 --> 00:33:30,930
but did I make us
a delicious anniversary meal?

585
00:33:31,451 --> 00:33:33,341
It was delicious.

586
00:33:33,501 --> 00:33:35,094
And you did brag.

587
00:33:36,316 --> 00:33:37,626
Oops.

588
00:33:37,789 --> 00:33:41,171
You have a little osso buco right...

589
00:33:42,747 --> 00:33:44,156
there.

590
00:33:44,317 --> 00:33:47,546
See, that's one of the perks of eating
at home. You get to kiss the cook.

591
00:33:47,709 --> 00:33:48,658
And no tipping.

592
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:52,633
- More wine?
- Yes, please.

593
00:34:04,445 --> 00:34:06,040
Happy anniversary.

594
00:34:07,389 --> 00:34:08,795
- Now?
- Yes, now.

595
00:34:08,956 --> 00:34:11,858
Before I'm lulled into a coma
by your light Milanese fare.

596
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:33,562
- Very nice.
- It's vintage. It's from 1968.

597
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:37,082
Very, very nice.

598
00:34:37,726 --> 00:34:42,295
And it's engraved.

599
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:46,137
"Me and you.

600
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:48,568
Just us two".

601
00:34:59,676 --> 00:35:01,719
Your gift is in the bedroom.

602
00:35:01,887 --> 00:35:05,017
There better be something in there
I haven't already seen.

603
00:35:22,717 --> 00:35:23,927
Well, I've seen the desk.

604
00:35:24,319 --> 00:35:27,068
But you haven't seen
what's in the desk.

605
00:35:29,854 --> 00:35:32,757
A state-of-the-art flat-screen.

606
00:35:36,542 --> 00:35:38,964
<i>And when
bedtime comes, take them in your arms...</i>

607
00:35:39,135 --> 00:35:40,794
<i>- And...
- into your dreams.</i>

608
00:35:40,957 --> 00:35:45,628
<i>WowWee Alive comes in pups.
Each sold separately from WowWee.</i>

609
00:35:46,814 --> 00:35:50,425
So we can lay in bed and watch
old black-and-white movies.

610
00:35:51,486 --> 00:35:54,650
The only word I heard
in that sentence was "old".

611
00:35:54,815 --> 00:35:56,570
Come on.
You remember how nice it was...

612
00:35:56,734 --> 00:35:58,775
<i>at the hotel watching
It Happened One Night.</i>

613
00:35:58,942 --> 00:36:04,213
Yes. And it was nice because
it only happened one night in a hotel.

614
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:08,854
Did I fuck up?

615
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:14,846
Well, a piece of jewelry
would've been nice.

616
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:17,080
Oh.

617
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,372
Can you get me and Big invited
to Smith's premiere?

618
00:36:21,535 --> 00:36:24,217
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Good.

619
00:36:25,278 --> 00:36:27,997
I think we need some glamour.

620
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:30,711
You know, the television
and the ordering in...

621
00:36:30,877 --> 00:36:34,938
it's just getting
a little too "Mr. and Mrs. Married".

622
00:36:35,103 --> 00:36:38,997
- You'll have a good time.
- Yeah. Ooh.

623
00:36:40,735 --> 00:36:42,298
Look at that.

624
00:36:43,038 --> 00:36:45,594
Very nice.

625
00:36:47,264 --> 00:36:49,685
It is a fabulous dress for the premiere.

626
00:36:49,855 --> 00:36:52,277
What's the worst thing
they could say about me in this dress?

627
00:36:52,449 --> 00:36:53,396
Uh...

628
00:36:53,567 --> 00:36:56,699
- "Who the hell does she think she is?"
- Just went to the top of my list.

629
00:36:56,863 --> 00:36:58,839
So, um, you and Smith.

630
00:36:59,007 --> 00:37:01,016
You're going
to this premiere together as?

631
00:37:01,184 --> 00:37:04,380
Oh, honey, just friends. But I may
throw him a fuck if I like the movie.

632
00:37:04,543 --> 00:37:07,162
Oh, that's nice. That should take
the edge off the reviews.

633
00:37:07,328 --> 00:37:10,490
Carrie. I haven't seen you here
in forever.

634
00:37:10,655 --> 00:37:13,789
Yeah, I know. I've been cheating on fashion
with furniture.

635
00:37:13,952 --> 00:37:17,367
- So, what can I help you with?
- Well, we need to find a red-carpet look...

636
00:37:17,536 --> 00:37:19,869
- for my friend Samantha.
- And I think we found it.

637
00:37:20,032 --> 00:37:21,462
Is that maybe a little young?

638
00:37:23,488 --> 00:37:24,567
I don't know.

639
00:37:24,737 --> 00:37:27,455
Exactly how old do you think I am?

640
00:37:28,737 --> 00:37:29,913
And not that it matters...

641
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:33,943
but I am 50-fucking-2
and I will rock this dress.

642
00:37:34,624 --> 00:37:36,600
I'll get you a changing room.

643
00:37:36,768 --> 00:37:39,135
<i>How's the writing going?
Still working for Vogue?</i>

644
00:37:39,296 --> 00:37:41,850
- Freelance.
- Oh, that's fabulous.

645
00:37:43,968 --> 00:37:45,179
You had to do that to her?

646
00:37:45,345 --> 00:37:46,906
Well, how else is she gonna learn?

647
00:37:47,073 --> 00:37:48,121
<i>And speaking of Vogue...</i>

648
00:37:48,288 --> 00:37:51,485
they want you to write a piece
to accompany the release of your book.

649
00:37:51,648 --> 00:37:54,877
Oh, great. Has there been any long-lead
press reaction to the book yet?

650
00:37:55,041 --> 00:37:57,496
Not yet, but I'm sure it'll all be fabulous.

651
00:38:04,223 --> 00:38:05,207
Is that you?

652
00:38:05,633 --> 00:38:07,456
I hope so.

653
00:38:08,096 --> 00:38:10,912
- Who else has a key?
- The Gristedes delivery boy.

654
00:38:11,072 --> 00:38:12,699
Really?

655
00:38:12,865 --> 00:38:16,345
Well, you know, you want food at home,
that's a risk you take.

656
00:38:16,512 --> 00:38:20,190
Don't get too comfortable on that couch.
We have to be at the premiere in an hour.

657
00:38:20,352 --> 00:38:22,396
- Is that tonight?
- Mm-hm.

658
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:24,895
- On a Monday?
- Yes.

659
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:27,130
We don't go out on Mondays.

660
00:38:28,803 --> 00:38:31,703
Well, first of all,
I didn't know we didn't...

661
00:38:31,873 --> 00:38:36,215
and second of all, problem?

662
00:38:36,385 --> 00:38:37,946
The market fell a hundred points...

663
00:38:38,113 --> 00:38:41,048
and now I have to get dressed up
and go to some Hollywood thing?

664
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:43,966
All you have to do
is put on a fresh shirt.

665
00:38:44,129 --> 00:38:45,340
Can't you go without me?

666
00:38:45,505 --> 00:38:48,473
I don't wanna go without you.
I wanna go with you.

667
00:38:48,642 --> 00:38:50,615
That's the point.

668
00:38:50,978 --> 00:38:53,628
Me and you out on the town.

669
00:38:53,795 --> 00:38:55,735
I've been out on the town for 30 years.

670
00:38:55,905 --> 00:38:57,728
I've seen the town, kid.

671
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:59,647
You go have fun with your friends.

672
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:01,851
But I wanna spend time with you.

673
00:39:02,018 --> 00:39:05,246
Oh, well, if you wanna spend time
with me, we'll stay here.

674
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:08,311
At our home. Which you made so perfect.

675
00:39:10,339 --> 00:39:14,464
You just don't want to get your ass
off the couch.

676
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,487
All right, fine. Stay.

677
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:20,730
I'll go with Stanford.

678
00:39:20,899 --> 00:39:22,527
Okay.

679
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:25,888

00:39:53,282 --> 00:39:54,744
Throw this back. We're going.

685
00:39:54,914 --> 00:39:56,922
- I thought you just said...
- I changed my mind.

686
00:39:57,090 --> 00:40:00,603
Do you really want to be pushed and shoved
in a crowd and eat bad catered food?

687
00:40:00,771 --> 00:40:05,146
Yes. Yes. I'm dying
to be pushed and shoved in a crowd...

688
00:40:05,315 --> 00:40:07,585
and eat bad catered food.

689
00:40:07,746 --> 00:40:11,358
I'm dying to eat anything
that doesn't come in a takeout box.

690
00:40:11,524 --> 00:40:12,636
Bottoms up.

691
00:40:12,803 --> 00:40:14,875
I'll put out a fresh shirt.

692
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:26,811
Fans on the right,
take models to the left.

693
00:40:26,979 --> 00:40:28,988
I think we're a little overdressed,
don't you?

694
00:40:29,156 --> 00:40:30,563
Please walk off the red carpet.

695
00:40:30,722 --> 00:40:32,218
Oh, we're VIPs. See?

696
00:40:32,387 --> 00:40:34,560
Show your bracelets.

697
00:40:34,722 --> 00:40:36,064
Show your bracelet.

698
00:40:36,546 --> 00:40:37,659
Smith! Right here!

699
00:40:37,828 --> 00:40:39,900
- One more.
- One more.

700
00:40:41,476 --> 00:40:43,417
Samantha looks smoking hot.

701
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:45,888
Is that dress maybe a little young?

702
00:40:46,052 --> 00:40:47,711
- Miley!
- Miley!

703
00:40:47,875 --> 00:40:50,494
- Miley!
- Maybe.

704
00:40:50,659 --> 00:40:51,772
Mother of God.

705
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:54,527
She's wearing the same dress
as teen queen Miley Cyrus.

706
00:40:55,011 --> 00:40:57,661
I know what's gonna happen,
but I can't look away.

707
00:40:57,828 --> 00:40:59,584
It's a red-carpet Hindenburg.

708
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,489
- Right this way, Miley!
- Over here!

709
00:41:03,651 --> 00:41:06,270
Awkward times two.

710
00:41:06,437 --> 00:41:09,631
Miley! Miley, is that your mother?

711
00:41:09,795 --> 00:41:12,991
Miley! Miley, right here! Miley!

712
00:41:13,156 --> 00:41:16,189
<i>Sometimes, a girlfriend
is a girl you've never even met.</i>

713
00:41:16,355 --> 00:41:17,502
Great dress.

714
00:41:17,667 --> 00:41:19,326
Thanks for saying that.

715
00:41:19,491 --> 00:41:22,527
And all is right in Hollywood.

716
00:41:23,076 --> 00:41:24,482
- Ooh.
- Just got pushed.

717
00:41:28,901 --> 00:41:30,721
<i>In the VIP room at the after-party...</i>

718
00:41:30,882 --> 00:41:33,601
<i>Samantha found herself
in the middle of the Middle East...</i>

719
00:41:33,765 --> 00:41:37,245
<i>seated directly across
from the film's producer, Sheikh Khalid.</i>

720
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:40,894
This is our first venture
into the world film market...

721
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,881
and we are honored
to be represented...

722
00:41:43,043 --> 00:41:46,939
by such a magnificent American star
as Smith Jerrod.

723
00:41:47,108 --> 00:41:48,090
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

724
00:41:48,261 --> 00:41:50,366
But you should really be
thanking Samantha.

725
00:41:50,532 --> 00:41:53,631
I mean, it's all her.
I was just a waiter before she came along.

726
00:41:53,798 --> 00:41:56,896
She handled my public relations
and made everybody see me as a star.

727
00:41:57,893 --> 00:41:58,874
Is this true?

728
00:41:59,044 --> 00:42:00,354
Well...

729
00:42:00,517 --> 00:42:01,762
yes.

730
00:42:03,845 --> 00:42:06,148
Have you ever been
to the United Arab Emirates?

731
00:42:06,309 --> 00:42:08,764
No, and I could kick myself.

732
00:42:08,934 --> 00:42:12,674
But friends of mine have been to Dubai
and they say it is amazing.

733
00:42:12,837 --> 00:42:14,942
Dubai is...

734
00:42:15,109 --> 00:42:17,630
I am at a loss for the word in English.

735
00:42:21,669 --> 00:42:22,944
Dubai is over.

736
00:42:23,108 --> 00:42:26,787
- Really?
- With all respect to my Emirate brother...

737
00:42:26,948 --> 00:42:28,510
Abu Dhabi is the future.

738
00:42:28,965 --> 00:42:33,373
A progressive, global city of commerce,
culture and...

739
00:42:33,542 --> 00:42:35,232
style.

740
00:42:36,102 --> 00:42:39,331
- It is the new Middle East.
- The new Middle East.

741
00:42:39,492 --> 00:42:43,584
But you should see it for yourself.
As my guest, at my new hotel.

742
00:42:44,548 --> 00:42:47,418
And if it does not interfere too much
with your wonderful time...

743
00:42:47,911 --> 00:42:50,299
we might be able
to discuss some business.

744
00:42:51,334 --> 00:42:52,960
- Business?
- Perhaps you could make...

745
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:57,947
America see my hotel as a star
as you did with Smith Jerrod.

746
00:43:00,262 --> 00:43:02,205
And suddenly, it's all about the couch.

747
00:43:02,374 --> 00:43:04,740
Two years ago, we never even
uttered the word "couch".

748
00:43:04,901 --> 00:43:07,618
And now, our entire universe
revolves around it.

749
00:43:07,782 --> 00:43:08,928
Count your blessings.

750
00:43:09,095 --> 00:43:11,963
Remember when you couldn't even
get him to sleep over?

751
00:43:12,228 --> 00:43:13,212
Yeah, I know. I know.

752
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:16,676
We're out tonight. He could at least slap
on a smile and have a good time.

753
00:43:16,838 --> 00:43:20,350
Already had a nervous breakdown.
No, believe me...

754
00:43:20,773 --> 00:43:22,783
He seems to be having a good time now.

755
00:43:22,948 --> 00:43:24,860
People think that Spaniards don't work...

756
00:43:25,383 --> 00:43:28,732
that we just take siestas
and drink Rioja and go to the beach.

757
00:43:28,902 --> 00:43:32,249
There was a jumbo shrimp free-for-all
at the raw bar.

758
00:43:32,967 --> 00:43:35,967
- I'm gonna be... I'll be right back.
- Okay.

759
00:43:36,134 --> 00:43:39,614
Every night before bed,
I am on my knees praying:

760
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:41,887
"Please, God, let it stay up".

761
00:43:44,518 --> 00:43:48,774
- Please let what stay up?
- Hi. The stock market.

762
00:43:48,935 --> 00:43:51,323
- This is Carmen Garcia Carrion.
- Carrion.

763
00:43:51,493 --> 00:43:52,672
- Carrion.
- Very good.

764
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:55,771
She is the Senior Vice President
of the Bank of Madrid.

765
00:43:56,519 --> 00:43:57,501
- Hi.
- Hi.

766
00:43:57,671 --> 00:43:59,557
- This is...
- Carrie Preston. Hi.

767
00:43:59,718 --> 00:44:02,945
Oh, Carrie Preston. Nice to meet you.
Your husband is very charming.

768
00:44:03,109 --> 00:44:04,539
Isn't he?

769
00:44:04,903 --> 00:44:08,994
So you were right about the catered food
and the shoving.

770
00:44:09,161 --> 00:44:11,493
So I'm ready to go whenever you are.

771
00:44:11,654 --> 00:44:13,216
Oh.

772
00:44:13,607 --> 00:44:16,159
- Well, nice to meet you both.
- Nice to meet you.

773
00:44:16,326 --> 00:44:17,789
I'll try to keep it up for you.

774
00:44:17,958 --> 00:44:20,643
- You're so funny. He's very funny.
- He is.

775
00:44:20,807 --> 00:44:21,854
- Good night.
- Good night.

776
00:44:22,024 --> 00:44:24,031
Bye. Good night.

777
00:44:24,199 --> 00:44:26,174
<i>Is that all you got?</i>

778
00:44:29,926 --> 00:44:33,375
<i>I mean, all we're trying to do
is just keep from getting dead.</i>

779
00:44:33,864 --> 00:44:34,848
<i>Damn!</i>

780
00:44:35,014 --> 00:44:40,231
<i>Since the very first Deadliest
Catch cameras rolled 7 seasons ago...</i>

781
00:44:40,999 --> 00:44:42,177
It's a little loud.

782
00:44:42,345 --> 00:44:44,514
<i>the fleet has gone on
more than 60 voyages.</i>

783
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:50,788
And for the record,
that is not a black-and-white movie.

784
00:44:50,953 --> 00:44:52,293
What?

785
00:44:52,455 --> 00:44:55,752
That was supposed to be
for black-and-white movies...

786
00:44:55,912 --> 00:44:58,497
and that
is not a black-and-white movie.

787
00:45:00,968 --> 00:45:04,677
When the gay guy hit on me
at the wedding you thought it was funny.

788
00:45:06,055 --> 00:45:07,911
I'm not upset about the flirt.

789
00:45:08,073 --> 00:45:12,350
I like the flirt. In fact, you could dial up
the flirt around here a little more.

790
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,857
I get TV and take-out guy...

791
00:45:15,017 --> 00:45:17,635
and Bank of Madrid lady,
she gets sparkle guy.

792
00:45:21,129 --> 00:45:23,975
I'm sorry. Are we having a discussion
or watching television?

793
00:45:24,137 --> 00:45:26,111
What is it with you and this television?

794
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,189
I don't wanna be one of those couples...

795
00:45:28,361 --> 00:45:32,255
lying in bed,
watching television and not talking.

796
00:45:32,423 --> 00:45:35,239
That is not the relationship
I signed up for.

797
00:45:35,657 --> 00:45:38,177
It's a television,
not the end of the world.

798
00:45:38,345 --> 00:45:40,613
Well, maybe to you it's not.

799
00:45:40,776 --> 00:45:43,328
<i>The Bering Sea has many faces.</i>

800
00:45:47,816 --> 00:45:49,888
You're not happy in,
and you're not happy out.

801
00:45:52,136 --> 00:45:53,217
What does that mean?

802
00:45:53,546 --> 00:45:55,104
Well, what do you want from me?

803
00:45:55,271 --> 00:45:57,760
I put on the shirt, I went to the thing...

804
00:45:57,929 --> 00:46:01,607
and now you're hammering me
about lying in bed and watching a little TV?

805
00:46:01,769 --> 00:46:03,492
I mean, what is the problem?

806
00:46:09,545 --> 00:46:11,007
Look...

807
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:14,181
it's just going to be you and me...

808
00:46:14,345 --> 00:46:17,345
every night, for the rest of our lives.

809
00:46:17,513 --> 00:46:20,360
And I think that we are going...

810
00:46:20,522 --> 00:46:22,945
to have to work on the sparkle...

811
00:46:23,115 --> 00:46:24,999
for the rest of our lives.

812
00:46:25,833 --> 00:46:27,393
Sparkle.

813
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:28,838
Got it.

814
00:46:39,848 --> 00:46:41,257
<i>Listen to that!</i>

815
00:46:41,419 --> 00:46:45,825
<i>When it starts really screaming, the waves
stack up, and you've got these big, nasty...</i>

816
00:46:45,994 --> 00:46:48,809
<i>You can, by unlocking
the power of natural juice...</i>

817
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:50,912
<i>with Jack LaLanne's Power Juicer.</i>

818
00:46:51,082 --> 00:46:52,805
<i>Change your life. Save your life.</i>

819
00:46:52,969 --> 00:46:54,945
<i>You are the most important person
you have.</i>

820
00:46:55,115 --> 00:46:56,869
<i>If you don't do it, who will?</i>

821
00:46:57,033 --> 00:47:01,344
<i>Juicing is the easy way to help save
your life. And I guarantee it.</i>

822
00:47:01,514 --> 00:47:03,652
<i>So don't delay.
Drink yourself healthy.</i>

823
00:47:03,817 --> 00:47:06,885
<i>Start enjoying the benefits of fresh,
all-natural juice.</i>

824
00:47:07,051 --> 00:47:09,440
<i>Order your Jack LaLanne
Power Juicer now.</i>

825
00:47:44,138 --> 00:47:46,473
<i>The last two years
weren't exactly the best time...</i>

826
00:47:46,635 --> 00:47:48,095
<i>to put an apartment
on the market.</i>

827
00:47:48,268 --> 00:47:49,577
<i>So we didn't.</i>

828
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:52,357
<i>And from time to time,
I'd come here to write.</i>

829
00:47:57,451 --> 00:47:59,109
<i>Or to visit the clothes.</i>

830
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:15,946
- Hello?
- What time did you wake up?

831
00:48:16,107 --> 00:48:18,343
I don't know, about 6.

832
00:48:20,363 --> 00:48:23,295
<i>I'm worried about the Vogue article,
so I wanted to get started.</i>

833
00:48:23,465 --> 00:48:25,410
You haven't written over there in a while.

834
00:48:25,579 --> 00:48:27,401
<i>Yeah, I know. I know. I just...</i>

835
00:48:27,562 --> 00:48:30,946
I don't know, I thought it would be easier
to work here. No distractions.

836
00:48:31,914 --> 00:48:33,476
<i>- Okay.
- Anyway, it's due Thursday...</i>

837
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:37,025
and I'm not even sure
what I'm writing yet, so, um...

838
00:48:37,195 --> 00:48:39,399
Maybe I should just stay here
until I get it done.

839
00:48:39,852 --> 00:48:41,128
You're going to stay there?

840
00:48:41,292 --> 00:48:43,560
<i>Just two days.
You know, just to bang it out.</i>

841
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:46,309
<i>- Is that all right?
- Whatever you need.</i>

842
00:48:47,338 --> 00:48:49,063
<i>- Everything okay?
- Yeah.</i>

843
00:48:49,228 --> 00:48:52,577
No, I just feel like I really need
to lock myself in a room...

844
00:48:52,747 --> 00:48:57,320
and not think about anything
but writing.

845
00:48:57,835 --> 00:48:58,817
Okay?

846
00:48:59,244 --> 00:49:00,226
Okay.

847
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:03,493
<i>- Just two days. Okay?
- Okay.</i>

848
00:49:04,076 --> 00:49:05,287
<i>- Okay.
- Bye.</i>

849
00:49:05,452 --> 00:49:06,825
Bye.

850
00:49:08,172 --> 00:49:10,376
<i>And I did think about
nothing but writing.</i>

851
00:49:10,732 --> 00:49:13,897
<i>Until the next day, when I could think
about nothing but food.</i>

852
00:49:14,059 --> 00:49:17,408
<i>And as long as I was going to break
to eat anyway, I thought:</i>

853
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:18,954
<i>"Why not call the girls?"</i>

854
00:49:19,116 --> 00:49:21,254
One week in Abu Dhabi,
all expenses paid.

855
00:49:21,645 --> 00:49:25,474
I've always been fascinated by
the Middle East. You know, desert moons...

856
00:49:25,645 --> 00:49:28,328
Scheherazade, magic carpets.

857
00:49:28,492 --> 00:49:32,519
<i>- Like Jasmine in Aladdin?
- Yes, sweetie, just like Jasmine.</i>

858
00:49:32,685 --> 00:49:34,310
But with cocktails.

859
00:49:35,628 --> 00:49:39,938
- It is exciting. When are you gonna go?
- I don't know. When can you all be free?

860
00:49:41,708 --> 00:49:43,879
You didn't think I was going
without my gals.

861
00:49:44,044 --> 00:49:46,314
- What?
- I told the sheikh I'd go on one condition:

862
00:49:46,605 --> 00:49:48,841
I'd get to bring my three best girlfriends.

863
00:49:49,005 --> 00:49:50,729
- Get out of town.
- My point exactly.

864
00:49:50,892 --> 00:49:54,188
And we are being flown
on the sheikh's own airline.

865
00:49:54,349 --> 00:49:56,072
- He has his own airline?
- Mm-hm.

866
00:49:56,236 --> 00:49:59,914
- Oh, that is one chic sheikh.
- Super, super, super 1st class.

867
00:50:00,075 --> 00:50:03,111
And you get your own individual suite
on the plane.

868
00:50:03,279 --> 00:50:05,000
- Oh, my God.
- All expenses paid for...

869
00:50:05,164 --> 00:50:07,980
everything for all of us.
All we have to do is pick the week.

870
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:11,241
And the sooner, the better.
I can hear the decadence calling.

871
00:50:11,406 --> 00:50:14,339
Let me just check my work schedule.
Yeah. All clear.

872
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:18,597
I gotta check with the old ball and chain,
but I'm good to go. Middle East me.

873
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:20,458
Charlotte, how's three weeks from now?

874
00:50:20,621 --> 00:50:22,345
Oh, I don't know. I...

875
00:50:22,702 --> 00:50:26,050
We have to go this month. Next month,
it gets so hot, you burst into flames.

876
00:50:26,222 --> 00:50:28,393
I bet that's not on their website.

877
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,411
I mean, I don't know if I can go at all.

878
00:50:30,573 --> 00:50:31,619
I have two children.

879
00:50:31,788 --> 00:50:33,283
Yes, yes, but you have a husband.

880
00:50:33,454 --> 00:50:36,867
And a full-time nanny. You said so yourself.
The kids love the nanny, right?

881
00:50:37,933 --> 00:50:40,618
- Yes, but...
- But what? What's the problem?

882
00:50:40,782 --> 00:50:42,855
I mean, we haven't been
anywhere together...

883
00:50:43,023 --> 00:50:45,672
since Carrie and Big's wedding blowup
honeymoon disaster.

884
00:50:45,838 --> 00:50:47,693
- Memories.
- And that was two years ago.

885
00:50:47,853 --> 00:50:51,715
Two years of bad business
and this bullshit economy, and I'm done.

886
00:50:51,885 --> 00:50:54,187
We need to go somewhere rich.

887
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:56,204
- Samantha, I appreciate the...
- No.

888
00:50:56,366 --> 00:50:58,886
I go to children's birthday parties for you.

889
00:50:59,054 --> 00:51:01,989
You are going to Abu Dhabi for me.

890
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,067
Children's birthday parties.

891
00:51:04,237 --> 00:51:05,547
Pulling out the big guns.

892
00:51:12,237 --> 00:51:13,350
- Okay.
- Thank you.

893
00:51:13,518 --> 00:51:16,518
Look at us. Going to Abu Dhabi.

894
00:51:25,678 --> 00:51:27,534
<i>- Hello.
- How'd it go?</i>

895
00:51:27,693 --> 00:51:29,833
Just finished.
And thanks for the time.

896
00:51:29,999 --> 00:51:33,478
<i>How soon can you be dressed for dinner?
I have 9:00 reservations.</i>

897
00:51:33,648 --> 00:51:35,306
Well...

898
00:51:35,471 --> 00:51:36,779
it's 8:30 already.

899
00:51:36,941 --> 00:51:38,853
<i>I'm downstairs.</i>

900
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:43,590
<i>And just like
that, it was 1998 again.</i>

901
00:51:43,756 --> 00:51:45,317
I'll be right down.

902
00:52:05,742 --> 00:52:07,782
- Hey, kid.
- Hey.

903
00:52:08,174 --> 00:52:09,385
I missed you.

904
00:52:09,999 --> 00:52:11,853
I missed you.

905
00:52:17,743 --> 00:52:19,847
<i>We had a wonderful dinner out.</i>

906
00:52:20,015 --> 00:52:21,259
<i>And back at home...</i>

907
00:52:21,424 --> 00:52:25,546
<i>the television stayed off
the entire night.</i>

908
00:52:29,168 --> 00:52:32,996
<i>And pretty soon,
the Middle East was upon us.</i>

909
00:52:33,391 --> 00:52:35,367
I need that.

910
00:52:35,791 --> 00:52:38,509
- Almost packed?
- One more to go.

911
00:52:39,854 --> 00:52:42,923
I had an idea I wanted
to talk to you about.

912
00:52:43,279 --> 00:52:46,345
Remember when you took those
two days away to finish your article...

913
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:49,293
- and then we had that great night?
- Mm-hm.

914
00:52:49,456 --> 00:52:51,628
Maybe we should think
about doing that every week.

915
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:54,279
Hear me out.

916
00:52:55,474 --> 00:52:59,663
After you took those two days
at your old apartment, I started thinking:

917
00:52:59,823 --> 00:53:01,165
What if I got a place?

918
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:05,581
- You want your own apartment?
- No, not my own apartment.

919
00:53:05,745 --> 00:53:08,111
Just a place that I can go
two days a week...

920
00:53:08,464 --> 00:53:11,759
lie around, watch television,
do the shit I wanna do that bugs you.

921
00:53:11,919 --> 00:53:13,327
And then the other five days...

922
00:53:13,488 --> 00:53:18,158
I'd be here and available
for dinners and sparkle or whatever.

923
00:53:18,928 --> 00:53:23,120
So you're telling me that you want
two days off a week from our marriage.

924
00:53:23,281 --> 00:53:25,068
And you'd have the same two days.

925
00:53:25,455 --> 00:53:26,765
Oh, my God.

926
00:53:26,929 --> 00:53:28,968
To work or see your friends.

927
00:53:29,137 --> 00:53:30,893
Do the things you wanna do without me.

928
00:53:31,056 --> 00:53:33,807
But I don't wanna do things without you.

929
00:53:33,969 --> 00:53:35,530
Carrie, come on, I know you.

930
00:53:35,698 --> 00:53:38,827
Can you honestly tell me you didn't enjoy
those two days to yourself?

931
00:53:39,537 --> 00:53:43,312
Two days, yes,
but I don't need it every week.

932
00:53:43,667 --> 00:53:47,495
Are you saying you need it every week?

933
00:53:48,015 --> 00:53:50,798
I don't know, it was just an idea.
Something to think about.

934
00:53:51,919 --> 00:53:54,190
Marriage doesn't work like that.

935
00:53:55,025 --> 00:53:58,025
I thought we were supposed to be
making up our own rules.

936
00:54:03,345 --> 00:54:08,015
So two days, then four days,
then what, no days?

937
00:54:08,176 --> 00:54:09,590
Is that where this is heading?

938
00:54:09,591 --> 00:54:11,754
I never would've brought it up
if I thought...

939
00:54:11,755 --> 00:54:14,956
it was gonna make you think I want out.
Look, I knew two years ago:

940
00:54:15,122 --> 00:54:17,030
I am exactly where I wanna be.

941
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:18,797
Five days a week.

942
00:54:18,962 --> 00:54:22,377
Look, I'm just trying to make it
a little easier for us to live together.

943
00:54:22,546 --> 00:54:23,950
I mean, we're married...

944
00:54:24,112 --> 00:54:25,903
but we're still us.

945
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:28,940
Is this because I'm a bitch wife
who nags you?

946
00:54:31,795 --> 00:54:34,063
I feel like I'm disappointing you
all the time.

947
00:54:34,513 --> 00:54:37,230
No, you're not disappointing me.

948
00:54:39,153 --> 00:54:40,364
Well, something is.

949
00:54:46,673 --> 00:54:50,450
So, what would I tell the girls?
"Big and I are taking two days a week off...

950
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:53,512
to make our marriage work better"?
They'd never understand.

951
00:54:53,681 --> 00:54:55,340
I don't care if they understand.

952
00:54:55,506 --> 00:54:56,913
This is our marriage.

953
00:54:57,073 --> 00:54:59,887
Me and you. Just like you said.

954
00:55:00,786 --> 00:55:02,215
Carrie...

955
00:55:02,386 --> 00:55:04,556
we're adults without children.

956
00:55:04,721 --> 00:55:07,439
We have the luxury to design our life.

957
00:55:08,498 --> 00:55:10,668
Well, you can't get your own apartment.

958
00:55:10,833 --> 00:55:13,221
That would freak me out
and it's a waste of money.

959
00:55:15,284 --> 00:55:17,933
You can have my old place
two days a week.

960
00:55:19,091 --> 00:55:23,977
Temporarily, till I figure out
how I feel about this.

961
00:55:25,139 --> 00:55:28,434
And I can take it back any time.

962
00:55:30,322 --> 00:55:31,305
Deal.

963
00:55:33,555 --> 00:55:35,213
- There's the car.
- I'll get your bags.

964
00:55:35,378 --> 00:55:36,719
Oh, yes, you will.

965
00:55:36,883 --> 00:55:40,812
And in a week, I'll pick you up
at the airport and take you home.

966
00:55:40,978 --> 00:55:42,865
Whose home, yours or mine?

967
00:55:43,764 --> 00:55:45,354
Ours.

968
00:55:55,604 --> 00:55:57,904
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

969
00:55:58,066 --> 00:55:59,391
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

970
00:55:59,453 --> 00:56:01,032
<i>we are pleased
to welcome you onboard</i>

971
00:56:01,033 --> 00:56:03,633
<i>our flight
to Abu Dhabi International Airport.</i>

972
00:56:03,893 --> 00:56:06,160
- Nice.
- Hi.

973
00:56:08,852 --> 00:56:10,477
Wow.

974
00:56:14,739 --> 00:56:16,331
Welcome aboard Afdal Air.

975
00:56:16,499 --> 00:56:18,124
Thank you.

976
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:20,363
Thank you. I love your hat.

977
00:56:20,851 --> 00:56:22,226
Thank you.

978
00:56:22,387 --> 00:56:24,296
And I thought mine
was gonna be too much.

979
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:26,445
Oh, my God.

980
00:56:26,611 --> 00:56:28,913
- This is bigger than my first apartment.
- Hot towel?

981
00:56:29,076 --> 00:56:30,702
And everything is so beautiful.

982
00:56:30,866 --> 00:56:32,907
Just like I promised: the best of the best.

983
00:56:33,908 --> 00:56:35,949
And look:

984
00:56:36,562 --> 00:56:37,871
Arabic Pringles.

985
00:56:38,034 --> 00:56:39,562
Okay, now I'm impressed.

986
00:56:39,732 --> 00:56:42,099
- Date?
- Would you care for a date?

987
00:56:42,261 --> 00:56:45,324
Not on vacation five minutes
and I already got a date.

988
00:56:45,491 --> 00:56:48,875
Dates are the traditional welcome fruit
of the Middle East.

989
00:56:49,044 --> 00:56:51,432
I read that in one of these.

990
00:56:51,604 --> 00:56:55,282
- Oh. You moving there?
- I've got us covered. The dos and don'ts.

991
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:56,622
And speaking of don'ts...

992
00:56:56,787 --> 00:56:59,471
men and women do not embrace
in public in the Middle East.

993
00:56:59,636 --> 00:57:02,418
Eh, eh, eh!
No, no, no. She's talking to you, sister.

994
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:05,579
Oh, please.
We're going to the new Middle East.

995
00:57:05,747 --> 00:57:08,465
And when I need a break
from all the real information...

996
00:57:10,963 --> 00:57:12,557
...I have this.

997
00:57:16,501 --> 00:57:17,481
Let me see this.

998
00:57:21,045 --> 00:57:24,359
Oh, listen. How exotic.
I wonder what she's saying.

999
00:57:24,532 --> 00:57:27,916
Probably telling us not to bring
those magazines on a 13-hour plane ride...

1000
00:57:28,083 --> 00:57:31,762
- with an impressionable woman.
- Charlotte, honey, don't read that.

1001
00:57:34,229 --> 00:57:35,790
Sorry.

1002
00:57:39,766 --> 00:57:42,287
You see,
it becomes a "Y" after a few drinks.

1003
00:57:42,452 --> 00:57:44,590
- I see.
- Care for another round, ladies?

1004
00:57:46,165 --> 00:57:48,303
It means "yes".

1005
00:57:50,326 --> 00:57:52,528
Yeah, not the best word for her to learn.

1006
00:57:52,692 --> 00:57:54,482
How many times are you gonna read that?

1007
00:57:57,908 --> 00:58:02,895
Big and I are thinking about taking
two days a week apart to do our own thing.

1008
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:04,045
Is everything okay?

1009
00:58:04,211 --> 00:58:06,963
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's just something we're talking about.

1010
00:58:07,125 --> 00:58:10,289
You know, he would get two days off
to do his things...

1011
00:58:10,454 --> 00:58:12,339
and on those days,
I would do my things.

1012
00:58:12,501 --> 00:58:16,178
You know, like write
or have dinner with you guys...

1013
00:58:16,341 --> 00:58:18,764
or I don't know, whatever.

1014
00:58:18,933 --> 00:58:20,721
Love it. I'm available.

1015
00:58:20,885 --> 00:58:23,733
Two days off?
You make marriage sound like a job.

1016
00:58:23,894 --> 00:58:26,282
Well, it may not be a job, but it's work.

1017
00:58:26,454 --> 00:58:28,788
Well, would that mean
that you would have two nights off too?

1018
00:58:28,949 --> 00:58:30,324
Mm-hm.

1019
00:58:30,487 --> 00:58:33,355
- Where would you sleep?
- Well, he's gonna stay at my old place...

1020
00:58:33,524 --> 00:58:35,053
and I'll stay at our new place.

1021
00:58:35,221 --> 00:58:37,970
I loved that time when Steve and I
knew we were together...

1022
00:58:38,133 --> 00:58:41,549
but we still had our own places.
That was the best of both worlds.

1023
00:58:41,717 --> 00:58:45,579
I just think marriage is two people...

1024
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:48,564
night after night,
sleeping in the same bed.

1025
00:58:48,725 --> 00:58:51,213
You have four people in your bed.

1026
00:58:51,382 --> 00:58:53,967
I've had four people in my bed.

1027
00:58:55,895 --> 00:58:57,105
No?

1028
00:58:57,271 --> 00:58:58,579
Well, ladies...

1029
00:58:58,741 --> 00:59:02,420
I am going to slap on
a patch of melatonin...

1030
00:59:02,581 --> 00:59:04,784
and have a seven-star snooze.

1031
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:07,919
- I will see you in the Middle East.
- Night.

1032
00:59:10,392 --> 00:59:11,470
It means "good night".

1033
00:59:15,479 --> 00:59:16,623
I'm sorry.

1034
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:18,350
Explain it again.

1035
00:59:18,517 --> 00:59:20,207
Just, what is it really about?

1036
00:59:23,831 --> 00:59:26,797
Big and I are just trying
to make our own rules.

1037
00:59:26,967 --> 00:59:29,650
You know, figure out what works best
for us as a couple...

1038
00:59:29,815 --> 00:59:31,822
not what society says should work
for us.

1039
00:59:31,990 --> 00:59:34,128
Okay. God.

1040
00:59:34,295 --> 00:59:35,341
Charlotte...

1041
00:59:35,512 --> 00:59:37,649
we're adults with no children.

1042
00:59:37,814 --> 00:59:40,782
We have the luxury
to design our own life.

1043
00:59:43,222 --> 00:59:46,322
But doesn't it hurt your feelings
that he would want time off?

1044
00:59:50,743 --> 00:59:52,782
You just don't get it.

1045
01:00:03,672 --> 01:00:05,971
<i>Somewhere over Africa...</i>

1046
01:00:06,135 --> 01:00:08,371
<i>I began to wonder
about relationships.</i>

1047
01:00:11,735 --> 01:00:14,703
<i>Can we really ever expect anyone
on the outside...</i>

1048
01:00:15,288 --> 01:00:19,444
<i>to understand what goes on
between two other people?</i>

1049
01:00:21,751 --> 01:00:25,941
<i>Eight time zones and a change
of clothes later, we arrived in the future.</i>

1050
01:00:26,102 --> 01:00:28,688
Have any of you ladies ever been
to the Middle East before?

1051
01:00:28,856 --> 01:00:31,670
No, we're all virgins.

1052
01:00:35,544 --> 01:00:37,334
Thank you.

1053
01:00:39,448 --> 01:00:43,059
Super, super, super gentle.
Thank you, thank you.

1054
01:00:58,808 --> 01:01:00,237
I am sorry, but...

1055
01:01:00,502 --> 01:01:02,708
do you have any drugs in your luggage?

1056
01:01:02,873 --> 01:01:05,718
No. Just my hormones.

1057
01:01:09,816 --> 01:01:11,408
You gotta be kidding me.

1058
01:01:11,577 --> 01:01:14,391
I am sorry. It is just a UAE law.

1059
01:01:14,554 --> 01:01:17,401
But they're all natural.
They're made from yams.

1060
01:01:17,944 --> 01:01:20,911
Ladies, these are not drugs.

1061
01:01:22,008 --> 01:01:25,620
Okay, I need to speak to an ambassador
or an embassy...

1062
01:01:25,783 --> 01:01:27,573
or someone in menopause.

1063
01:01:27,738 --> 01:01:28,811
Samantha, please calm down.

1064
01:01:28,812 --> 01:01:29,872
This is getting very,

1065
01:01:29,873 --> 01:01:32,773
- very Midnight Express.
- Okay. Fine, take them.

1066
01:01:34,521 --> 01:01:38,098
Without those creams and vitamins,
I will go ricocheting back into menopause.

1067
01:01:38,263 --> 01:01:41,842
- Relax, it's one week.
- Tell that to the beard I'll be growing.

1068
01:01:42,008 --> 01:01:45,073
We've set your meeting with Sheikh
Khalid for the end of your trip...

1069
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:47,411
after you and your friends
have experienced...

1070
01:01:47,577 --> 01:01:49,813
the best of what Abu Dhabi has
to offer.

1071
01:01:49,977 --> 01:01:51,570
Which starts right now.

1072
01:01:51,737 --> 01:01:53,263
Yours for the entire trip.

1073
01:01:53,689 --> 01:01:56,079
Four new Maybachs.

1074
01:01:58,328 --> 01:02:00,052
Wow, do we need all four?

1075
01:02:00,218 --> 01:02:02,552
It is already arranged.

1076
01:02:06,489 --> 01:02:10,483
I'll be in my own private air conditioning.

1077
01:02:11,352 --> 01:02:14,649
I will be departing from you here.
The hotel awaits your arrival.

1078
01:02:14,809 --> 01:02:18,289
If you need me for anything,
please do not hesitate to ask.

1079
01:02:18,457 --> 01:02:20,213
Could you help me check
and make sure...

1080
01:02:20,379 --> 01:02:22,713
that my iPhone
has the proper international code?

1081
01:02:24,379 --> 01:02:28,307
I think that we can find someone
not so official to help with that.

1082
01:02:28,697 --> 01:02:31,184
- He offered.
- Hey, what's the holdup?

1083
01:02:31,353 --> 01:02:33,776
We got a lot of Abu Dhabi to do.

1084
01:02:33,944 --> 01:02:36,402
Abu Dhabi do.

1085
01:02:37,816 --> 01:02:39,028
Welcome to Abu Dhabi.

1086
01:02:39,192 --> 01:02:40,883
- Thank you.
- Pleasure.

1087
01:02:52,315 --> 01:02:54,223
Oh, my God.

1088
01:03:29,306 --> 01:03:32,951
Oh, Toto, I don't think
we're in Kansas anymore.

1089
01:03:35,642 --> 01:03:36,755
Miss Jones?

1090
01:03:36,922 --> 01:03:38,516
I am Mr. Safir, the hotel manager.

1091
01:03:39,322 --> 01:03:42,071
- I trust your flight was pleasant?
- Like a magic carpet.

1092
01:03:42,427 --> 01:03:44,403
- How charming. For you.
- Oh, thank you.

1093
01:03:44,569 --> 01:03:46,164
- Please, for you.
- Thank you.

1094
01:03:46,329 --> 01:03:48,120
Please... Oh, thank you.

1095
01:03:48,284 --> 01:03:50,355
This way, if you please, ladies.

1096
01:03:50,524 --> 01:03:52,279
How do we tip in Abu Dhabi?

1097
01:03:52,444 --> 01:03:54,231
Have you got any loose rubies?

1098
01:03:55,675 --> 01:03:58,610
SAFIR: We have many wonderful things
planned for you at the hotel.

1099
01:04:00,634 --> 01:04:03,353
- Oh. This is gorgeous.
- Thank you.

1100
01:04:03,515 --> 01:04:06,482
And, please, some Arabic coffee.

1101
01:04:06,651 --> 01:04:09,204
- Thank you.
- Made with rose water and cumin.

1102
01:04:10,523 --> 01:04:11,635
That means "thank you".

1103
01:04:12,122 --> 01:04:14,010
- You speak Arabic?
- Not yet.

1104
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:16,723
Well, you're off to a great start.

1105
01:04:20,316 --> 01:04:21,427
It's different.

1106
01:04:21,596 --> 01:04:22,936
Not your cup of tea.

1107
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:24,756
- What's with all the men?
- Thank you.

1108
01:04:24,922 --> 01:04:26,614
Oh, the World Cup trials are here.

1109
01:04:26,779 --> 01:04:27,893
Wow.

1110
01:04:28,059 --> 01:04:31,094
- Did they also bring their balls?
- Yes, they have many, many balls.

1111
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:33,525
This way please, for your private elevator.

1112
01:04:33,691 --> 01:04:35,961
- We have a private elevator?
- Apparently.

1113
01:04:50,427 --> 01:04:51,704
This can't be for us.

1114
01:04:51,868 --> 01:04:53,395
We must not be in the right place.

1115
01:04:53,564 --> 01:04:57,176
No, for once in my life,
I can say without a shadow of a doubt...

1116
01:04:57,339 --> 01:05:00,537
I am in the exact right place.

1117
01:05:03,932 --> 01:05:05,557
Who ordered the cute?

1118
01:05:08,061 --> 01:05:09,687
Welcome to the Jewel Suite.

1119
01:05:10,109 --> 01:05:11,634
- Who is Miss Jones?
- I am.

1120
01:05:11,803 --> 01:05:13,844
We are thrilled to welcome you
and your guests.

1121
01:05:14,012 --> 01:05:15,834
- Thank you.
- Abdul will be your butler...

1122
01:05:15,997 --> 01:05:17,457
= Miss Jones.
- Mm.

1123
01:05:17,629 --> 01:05:19,451
- Miss Bradshaw?
- Oh, that's me.

1124
01:05:19,612 --> 01:05:23,093
- I am Gaurau. I will be here to serve you.
- Thank you.

1125
01:05:23,261 --> 01:05:24,884
And Resir for Miss Hobbes.

1126
01:05:25,403 --> 01:05:26,932
It's "Hobbes".

1127
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:28,595
I'm so very sorry.

1128
01:05:28,987 --> 01:05:30,396
No, it's...

1129
01:05:30,557 --> 01:05:32,466
It's not a big deal. It's fine.

1130
01:05:33,532 --> 01:05:34,810
And Adman for Miss York.

1131
01:05:36,414 --> 01:05:38,069
If you will, please, follow us.

1132
01:05:39,707 --> 01:05:42,676
- We each get our own butler?
- Makes sense, we each get our own car.

1133
01:05:42,846 --> 01:05:46,259
Rotunda. Miss York, this way, if you will.

1134
01:05:47,229 --> 01:05:49,651
"York"? What happened to "Goldenblatt"?

1135
01:05:49,822 --> 01:05:52,374
- It's the Middle East.
- It's the new Middle East.

1136
01:05:52,542 --> 01:05:55,225
It's the Middle East.

1137
01:05:56,094 --> 01:05:59,127
This is the den.
Complete with its own private bar.

1138
01:05:59,292 --> 01:06:01,813
Ooh. Belly up, ladies.

1139
01:06:04,030 --> 01:06:07,476
There is also a private kitchen
available for you day and night.

1140
01:06:07,645 --> 01:06:10,012
Dream come true.

1141
01:06:10,430 --> 01:06:14,225
In here,
you will find your informal lounge.

1142
01:06:16,607 --> 01:06:18,874
Through there, the double boudoir.

1143
01:06:19,037 --> 01:06:20,019
- Roomies.
- Roomies.

1144
01:06:20,190 --> 01:06:23,289
And in here, the formal salon.

1145
01:06:27,805 --> 01:06:30,653
And, ladies, out on the terrace...

1146
01:06:35,007 --> 01:06:37,241
you have an overview
of the entire grounds.

1147
01:06:38,749 --> 01:06:42,775
There's also a bar pool,
five international restaurants, a spa...

1148
01:06:42,942 --> 01:06:44,600
a fitness center, a nightclub...

1149
01:06:44,768 --> 01:06:47,132
and, of course,
the beach and beach clubs.

1150
01:06:47,294 --> 01:06:51,157
I've taken the liberty of arranging massages
for you, followed by an early dinner.

1151
01:06:51,326 --> 01:06:54,359
Then you can have a good night's rest and
wake up tomorrow fresh on Abu Dhabi time.

1152
01:06:54,526 --> 01:06:56,764
There's nothing I don't love
about everything you just said.

1153
01:06:58,685 --> 01:07:00,922
Here is Abdul with drinks.

1154
01:07:01,085 --> 01:07:03,115
If there is anything you need,
anything at all...

1155
01:07:03,187 --> 01:07:06,396
please do not hesitate to ask.
We are at your service.

1156
01:07:24,478 --> 01:07:27,097
<i>The robes are called abayas...</i>

1157
01:07:27,262 --> 01:07:31,005
<i>and the veil that covers everything
except the eyes is a niqab.</i>

1158
01:07:31,167 --> 01:07:33,219
Certainly cuts back on the Botox bill.

1159
01:07:34,878 --> 01:07:39,996
"Women are required to dress in a way
that does not attract sexual attention".

1160
01:07:41,684 --> 01:07:43,343
Samantha, you gotta...

1161
01:07:43,508 --> 01:07:46,323
We're at the hotel.
It's a free zone.

1162
01:07:46,483 --> 01:07:48,339
Still. Out of respect.

1163
01:07:50,323 --> 01:07:54,546
Well, I gotta say, I am digging the sequin
trim on the Real Housewife of Abu Dhabi.

1164
01:07:54,963 --> 01:07:56,173
What's up with that?

1165
01:07:56,339 --> 01:08:00,780
Younger Muslim women are embracing
old traditions in new and personal ways.

1166
01:08:01,812 --> 01:08:03,754
Well, I could get into the head wrap...

1167
01:08:03,923 --> 01:08:07,698
but the veil across the mouth,
it freaks me out.

1168
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:10,219
It's like they don't want them
to have a voice.

1169
01:08:10,387 --> 01:08:11,663
Yeah, or hormones.

1170
01:08:11,827 --> 01:08:15,406
I cannot find one Internet hormone site
that's not blocked.

1171
01:08:15,571 --> 01:08:17,458
At least you know your phone is working.

1172
01:08:17,619 --> 01:08:20,848
I can't get Harry to respond
to any of my texts and it's not like him.

1173
01:08:21,011 --> 01:08:22,602
But you called him
when you arrived, right?

1174
01:08:22,603 --> 01:08:24,303
Yeah, but that was hours ago.

1175
01:08:29,075 --> 01:08:31,408
French fries for the lady
with the veil.

1176
01:08:32,019 --> 01:08:34,222
How is she gonna do that?

1177
01:08:36,947 --> 01:08:39,565
A lift for every fry.

1178
01:08:39,730 --> 01:08:41,737
That is a major commitment
to fried food.

1179
01:08:42,962 --> 01:08:44,391
What time is it in New York now?

1180
01:08:44,978 --> 01:08:46,888
Okay. Sweetie, you gotta stop.

1181
01:08:47,058 --> 01:08:48,814
- What do you mean?
- You are obsessing...

1182
01:08:48,978 --> 01:08:52,622
...about something
that is happening 6700 miles away...

1183
01:08:52,786 --> 01:08:56,561
...and you're missing the woman with the
veil eating french fries at the next table.

1184
01:08:56,882 --> 01:08:59,271
Consider this an interfriendtion.

1185
01:08:59,441 --> 01:09:02,921
You have to stop obsessing
about the nanny.

1186
01:09:03,090 --> 01:09:04,977
Well, it is all Samantha's fault.

1187
01:09:05,138 --> 01:09:08,487
I was perfectly happy and then she went
and opened her big mouth.

1188
01:09:08,657 --> 01:09:10,349
<i>Maybe we should get her a niqab.</i>

1189
01:09:10,513 --> 01:09:12,847
Look, I warn you right now,
don't come down on me.

1190
01:09:13,009 --> 01:09:14,701
With the jet lag
and the no hormones...

1191
01:09:14,865 --> 01:09:17,864
who knows what kind
of mood swings I'm capable of.

1192
01:09:20,304 --> 01:09:22,693
I like the necklace.

1193
01:09:23,281 --> 01:09:24,622
Hi.

1194
01:10:14,699 --> 01:10:15,746
- Miss?
- Ah!

1195
01:10:15,915 --> 01:10:17,605
Oh, God.

1196
01:10:19,018 --> 01:10:20,774
I'm so very sorry.

1197
01:10:21,162 --> 01:10:24,610
It's okay. I'm sorry. I didn't...

1198
01:10:25,290 --> 01:10:27,112
I didn't expect you to still be here.

1199
01:10:27,274 --> 01:10:28,703
You did not dismiss me.

1200
01:10:28,874 --> 01:10:31,972
Oh. I was supposed to do that?

1201
01:10:32,778 --> 01:10:34,338
Oh.

1202
01:10:34,506 --> 01:10:36,066
I'm sorry, Gaurau, I didn't know.

1203
01:10:36,234 --> 01:10:39,016
It is my pleasure. What can I do for you?

1204
01:10:39,177 --> 01:10:42,439
Nothing, I was just gonna warm
some milk up, but you go, go home.

1205
01:10:42,602 --> 01:10:44,609
No, no, allow me, please. I insist.

1206
01:10:46,922 --> 01:10:47,969
I will bring it to you.

1207
01:10:48,137 --> 01:10:50,024
Oh, you don't have to. I'll wait.

1208
01:10:59,752 --> 01:11:03,331
If you will permit me,
might I suggest a touch of cinnamon?

1209
01:11:04,201 --> 01:11:05,892
It is a secret learned from my wife.

1210
01:11:07,465 --> 01:11:11,327
Well, please apologize to your wife
for my keeping you here all night.

1211
01:11:11,497 --> 01:11:13,537
It is fine. She is in India.

1212
01:11:13,704 --> 01:11:15,330
Oh.

1213
01:11:15,496 --> 01:11:16,839
I will see her in one month.

1214
01:11:17,001 --> 01:11:20,416
I'm afraid if I apologize then,
it will hardly make sense.

1215
01:11:23,048 --> 01:11:25,503
So you work here
and you travel back and forth?

1216
01:11:25,672 --> 01:11:30,887
Yes. Every three months, when I have a
break in work and can afford the plane fare.

1217
01:11:33,832 --> 01:11:34,945
Isn't that hard?

1218
01:11:36,104 --> 01:11:37,184
What, miss?

1219
01:11:37,512 --> 01:11:41,440
Just, you know, being married
and spending all that time apart.

1220
01:11:43,944 --> 01:11:45,798
Time does not matter.

1221
01:11:45,959 --> 01:11:49,375
When we see each other, each time...

1222
01:11:49,992 --> 01:11:51,039
it is very wonderful.

1223
01:11:53,255 --> 01:11:55,295
I'm a lucky man.

1224
01:12:00,743 --> 01:12:04,605
Okay, now I'm gonna try
one of these little date confections.

1225
01:12:12,102 --> 01:12:14,045
I think my butler's gay.

1226
01:12:14,214 --> 01:12:16,800
- First, he's way too cute.
- That's genetics.

1227
01:12:16,967 --> 01:12:19,781
I asked about his dating life
and he said it was private.

1228
01:12:19,943 --> 01:12:21,251
That's appropriate.

1229
01:12:21,414 --> 01:12:24,229
When I asked how to pronounce
his name he said:

1230
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:26,626
"Abdul. Like Paula".

1231
01:12:26,790 --> 01:12:29,724
- And that's gay.
- Yeah.

1232
01:12:29,894 --> 01:12:31,748
- Morning.
- Morning.

1233
01:12:31,910 --> 01:12:33,503
- Morning.
- How'd you sleep?

1234
01:12:34,246 --> 01:12:35,423
All right.

1235
01:12:37,095 --> 01:12:39,134
- Samantha, what are you eating?
- Mm. Hummus.

1236
01:12:39,718 --> 01:12:43,613
I read online that chickpeas are high
in natural estrogen.

1237
01:12:43,781 --> 01:12:46,498
So are yams.
Paula Abdul's getting me some later.

1238
01:12:47,334 --> 01:12:49,122
Is she here too?

1239
01:12:50,245 --> 01:12:53,823
Good morning, miss.
What can we bring you for breakfast?

1240
01:12:54,341 --> 01:12:55,770
Just some fruit, please.

1241
01:12:55,941 --> 01:12:57,600
Thank you.

1242
01:12:58,725 --> 01:13:00,612
He is so nice. What's his name again?

1243
01:13:00,774 --> 01:13:02,082
Gaurau.

1244
01:13:02,245 --> 01:13:05,661
He's from India.
His wife still lives there.

1245
01:13:05,829 --> 01:13:09,058
They only see each other once
every three months when they can afford it.

1246
01:13:09,221 --> 01:13:13,182
And I asked him if that was hard
for them and he said:

1247
01:13:13,348 --> 01:13:14,909
"Time doesn't matter".

1248
01:13:15,077 --> 01:13:18,787
That each time they see each other
it's wonderful.

1249
01:13:19,587 --> 01:13:22,305
So, see, there are all kinds
of marriages.

1250
01:13:30,244 --> 01:13:32,962
<i>Who's up for a morning trip
to the souk in Old Abu Dhabi?</i>

1251
01:13:33,125 --> 01:13:34,106
<i>What's a souk?</i>

1252
01:13:34,276 --> 01:13:39,262
<i>It's a market where you can buy gold,
spices, textiles and souk things.</i>

1253
01:13:39,427 --> 01:13:41,850
<i>I'm in. One sip then souk.</i>

1254
01:13:45,092 --> 01:13:46,553
Wow.

1255
01:13:46,723 --> 01:13:50,301
- Oh, it's so beautiful.
- We'll be back in time for lunch.

1256
01:13:50,979 --> 01:13:53,248
- Thank you, Gaurau.
MIRANDA: Thank you, Resir.

1257
01:13:53,411 --> 01:13:55,101
Got it.

1258
01:14:01,315 --> 01:14:03,519
You must not have
a forbidden experience.

1259
01:14:03,875 --> 01:14:05,184
Oh, okay.

1260
01:14:05,347 --> 01:14:07,649
Men may approach you
with black-market wristwatches.

1261
01:14:07,811 --> 01:14:09,539
If you engage them,
they'll move you to a room...

1262
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:11,440
and try to sell you other items.
It is illegal.

1263
01:14:11,907 --> 01:14:15,703
Other than that, you'll not have to worry.
People here are very honest.

1264
01:14:16,323 --> 01:14:17,849
Driver.

1265
01:14:57,857 --> 01:15:00,112
- Mm. Smells so good.
- Yeah.

1266
01:15:05,792 --> 01:15:06,775
Ladies.

1267
01:15:06,945 --> 01:15:09,978
- Forbidden experience coming at you.
- Ladies. Ladies.

1268
01:15:10,144 --> 01:15:11,454
- No, no.
- Ladies.

1269
01:15:12,736 --> 01:15:14,143
No.

1270
01:15:16,064 --> 01:15:17,210
Oh.

1271
01:15:17,376 --> 01:15:19,515
<i>And from the forbidden
to the necessary.</i>

1272
01:15:19,872 --> 01:15:21,051
I'll be going there.

1273
01:15:21,216 --> 01:15:25,078
Of course you will. I'm going back
for more spices. I don't think I got enough.

1274
01:15:25,247 --> 01:15:26,840
Okay.

1275
01:15:33,695 --> 01:15:35,768
These are very pretty.

1276
01:15:35,936 --> 01:15:36,918
Do you speak English?

1277
01:15:37,088 --> 01:15:38,811
Yes.

1278
01:15:43,328 --> 01:15:46,492
May I try this? Thank you.

1279
01:15:47,968 --> 01:15:49,756
Let me just get them...

1280
01:15:52,064 --> 01:15:53,405
Oh, thank you.

1281
01:15:57,342 --> 01:15:59,547
So, yes, yes.

1282
01:16:00,062 --> 01:16:01,492
I'll take them.

1283
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:03,485
Thank you.

1284
01:16:03,998 --> 01:16:06,333
So pretty.

1285
01:16:10,270 --> 01:16:11,317
Just...

1286
01:16:12,223 --> 01:16:13,270
Thank you.

1287
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:15,806
So, for this, how much?

1288
01:16:15,967 --> 01:16:17,690
One hundred dirham.

1289
01:16:20,190 --> 01:16:21,979
- Twenty dollars?
- Yes.

1290
01:16:22,941 --> 01:16:25,331
- For shoes?
- Yes.

1291
01:16:26,526 --> 01:16:28,501
Okay, thank you.

1292
01:16:30,174 --> 01:16:33,305
That's 100. Thank you.

1293
01:16:34,109 --> 01:16:36,827
Oh, you know what,
I'll just put the shoes in my purse.

1294
01:16:36,990 --> 01:16:39,706
Okay. I'm just gonna make room.

1295
01:16:48,221 --> 01:16:49,879
Is that the call to prayer?

1296
01:16:50,046 --> 01:16:51,900
Yes.

1297
01:17:07,293 --> 01:17:11,319
<i>And there, in the middle of Old
Abu Dhabi, was an old love.</i>

1298
01:17:11,485 --> 01:17:13,394
<i>- The guy hid them back there...
- Aidan.</i>

1299
01:17:41,596 --> 01:17:43,668
This is the best mirage that I've ever had.

1300
01:17:44,955 --> 01:17:48,304
And I did some peyote once in Arizona
that blew my head off.

1301
01:17:49,276 --> 01:17:51,064
Come here, you.

1302
01:17:53,179 --> 01:17:54,772
Is this allowed here?

1303
01:17:56,123 --> 01:17:57,203
What the...?

1304
01:17:57,371 --> 01:18:00,470
Abu Dhabi? What? You? Why?

1305
01:18:00,635 --> 01:18:06,036
Well, I heard
about this amazing deal on shoes.

1306
01:18:06,715 --> 01:18:09,333
No, I'm here with the girls.

1307
01:18:09,499 --> 01:18:13,011
Yeah, Samantha worked us all in
on her free PR trip.

1308
01:18:13,179 --> 01:18:15,284
And you? What?

1309
01:18:15,451 --> 01:18:19,379
I'm on the third leg of a buying trip.
Bali, India, here.

1310
01:18:19,547 --> 01:18:21,718
Yeah, I import rugs to sell
with the furniture...

1311
01:18:21,882 --> 01:18:24,784
and I'm talking like I don't know you.
Come here again.

1312
01:18:24,955 --> 01:18:26,776
Holy moly.

1313
01:18:33,561 --> 01:18:37,817
You know,
Miranda's here with me, so, I don't...

1314
01:18:37,978 --> 01:18:41,555
Shall we grab a kebab or a whatever?

1315
01:18:42,009 --> 01:18:46,232
Shoot. I have to eat lunch
with my business partners.

1316
01:18:46,970 --> 01:18:52,152
And they don't cotton to the ladies
at the lunches.

1317
01:18:52,313 --> 01:18:54,680
<i>I knew I should've packed my burqa.</i>

1318
01:18:55,481 --> 01:18:58,415
We're going to a different city after lunch.
I'll be back tomorrow.

1319
01:18:58,585 --> 01:19:00,789
Can I take you out to dinner,
just you and me?

1320
01:19:00,952 --> 01:19:02,708
Oh. Uh...

1321
01:19:02,872 --> 01:19:05,240
Well, I don't really know
what the girls have planned.

1322
01:19:05,401 --> 01:19:07,605
You know,
Miranda's got us scheduled pretty...

1323
01:19:07,768 --> 01:19:10,768
It's okay. Look, if you have the time...

1324
01:19:11,096 --> 01:19:15,220
<i>...the locals say that the restaurant at my
hotel has the best muhammara in town.</i>

1325
01:19:15,383 --> 01:19:17,172
That's my international cell.

1326
01:19:17,336 --> 01:19:19,572
International cell.

1327
01:19:19,991 --> 01:19:22,163
Look at you, all grown-up.

1328
01:19:23,512 --> 01:19:25,203
I should get going.

1329
01:19:25,369 --> 01:19:27,310
They consider it rude
to keep people waiting here.

1330
01:19:31,448 --> 01:19:33,107
Bye.

1331
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:38,674
They also consider it rude
not to call an old boyfriend for dinner.

1332
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:45,427
Carrie!

1333
01:19:45,975 --> 01:19:47,601
How weird is this?

1334
01:19:50,103 --> 01:19:52,078
How did he look?

1335
01:19:52,535 --> 01:19:54,837
Like no time had gone by.

1336
01:19:55,575 --> 01:19:57,909
- Did you tell him you and Big got married?
CARRIE: Yes.

1337
01:19:58,071 --> 01:19:59,959
Those were the first words
out of my mouth.

1338
01:20:00,119 --> 01:20:02,803
"Hey, we're here in Abu Dhabi
and I married that man you hated".

1339
01:20:04,375 --> 01:20:06,644
- Is he still married?
- I have no idea.

1340
01:20:06,807 --> 01:20:08,334
Was he wearing a wedding ring?

1341
01:20:08,502 --> 01:20:09,844
I believe he was.

1342
01:20:10,870 --> 01:20:14,067
- Are you gonna have dinner with him?
- We're here to spend time together.

1343
01:20:14,231 --> 01:20:16,532
- Just the four of us.
- Right.

1344
01:20:18,455 --> 01:20:21,104
- Um, legs.
- Miranda, I'm at the pool.

1345
01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:24,084
- What am I supposed to wear?
- How about a burkini?

1346
01:20:26,166 --> 01:20:28,054
Yeah, they have them at the gift shop.

1347
01:20:28,214 --> 01:20:29,643
Forget about them.

1348
01:20:30,294 --> 01:20:31,887
Look.

1349
01:20:32,054 --> 01:20:35,730
<i>Arriving at the pool,
direct from a sweaty practice match:</i>

1350
01:20:35,893 --> 01:20:37,486
<i>The Australian rugby team.</i>

1351
01:20:39,286 --> 01:20:41,075
Who ordered the Aussie sausage?

1352
01:20:55,509 --> 01:20:56,524
This is a disaster.

1353
01:20:57,269 --> 01:20:59,657
I have a whole pool of testosterone
from down under...

1354
01:20:59,828 --> 01:21:01,901
and I'm not feeling anything
down under.

1355
01:21:02,677 --> 01:21:06,288
It's official.
The estrogen has left the building.

1356
01:21:06,452 --> 01:21:08,842
Okay, I am pulling an interfriendtion.

1357
01:21:09,012 --> 01:21:10,834
If I can't talk anymore about Harry...

1358
01:21:10,996 --> 01:21:13,200
then she can't talk anymore
about hormones.

1359
01:21:14,101 --> 01:21:17,068
I can't eat any more yams.

1360
01:21:17,397 --> 01:21:18,378
Couldn't hurt.

1361
01:21:18,549 --> 01:21:22,062
Ladies, we came here
to have fun together.

1362
01:21:22,228 --> 01:21:24,617
And I, being the type-A
control freak that I am...

1363
01:21:24,788 --> 01:21:29,196
have planned a full day and night
of big Abu Dhabi fun.

1364
01:21:29,364 --> 01:21:31,469
I am gonna turn this interfriendtion...

1365
01:21:31,636 --> 01:21:34,483
into an interfuntion.

1366
01:21:40,403 --> 01:21:41,385
Still nothing.

1367
01:22:24,530 --> 01:22:25,740
Thank you.

1368
01:22:25,906 --> 01:22:28,110
Thank you, Gaurau.

1369
01:22:32,498 --> 01:22:35,247
- Oh, my.
- You said we were going to lunch.

1370
01:22:35,409 --> 01:22:38,312
We are. Camels, then lunch. It'll be fun.

1371
01:22:38,674 --> 01:22:40,135
Not to not be fun...

1372
01:22:40,306 --> 01:22:43,240
but I'm not really dressed
to get on a camel.

1373
01:22:43,410 --> 01:22:44,391
I've got that covered.

1374
01:22:47,218 --> 01:22:49,105
- What?
- Gift of the hotel.

1375
01:22:49,265 --> 01:22:52,396
And don't worry,
I had Abdul pick them out.

1376
01:22:54,481 --> 01:22:56,204
Serious?

1377
01:22:56,945 --> 01:23:00,261
- Care to change in the Bedouin tent?
- Bedouin, Bath and Beyond.

1378
01:23:00,945 --> 01:23:02,351
Still nothing.

1379
01:23:02,512 --> 01:23:04,880
Thank you, Gaurau, yes.

1380
01:23:05,041 --> 01:23:07,790
- This is very exciting suddenly.
- Help. Wait, wait. Help.

1381
01:23:07,952 --> 01:23:09,992
Heels. Sand. Hot.

1382
01:24:08,623 --> 01:24:10,761
- I'm having a hot flash.
- You're fine.

1383
01:24:10,927 --> 01:24:12,748
Seriously, they're starting.

1384
01:24:12,911 --> 01:24:15,212
Look, you're on a camel
in the middle of the desert.

1385
01:24:15,375 --> 01:24:17,381
If you're not having a hot flash,
you're dead.

1386
01:24:17,551 --> 01:24:19,820
- What do you think?
- This is fabulous.

1387
01:24:21,102 --> 01:24:22,695
There's my phone. Oh, my God.
It's my phone.

1388
01:24:22,862 --> 01:24:24,717
Who's her long distance provider?

1389
01:24:25,934 --> 01:24:28,389
Hello, Harry? What have you been doing?

1390
01:24:28,558 --> 01:24:31,940
I woke you up? Harry, wait.
You're going in and out.

1391
01:24:32,910 --> 01:24:34,022
Can you hear me now?

1392
01:24:34,382 --> 01:24:35,462
Harry?

1393
01:24:35,629 --> 01:24:36,873
Miranda, I'm falling!

1394
01:24:37,837 --> 01:24:39,332
Sir, she's falling!

1395
01:24:40,237 --> 01:24:41,896
Are you okay?

1396
01:24:42,061 --> 01:24:43,272
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

1397
01:24:43,437 --> 01:24:44,616
Are you all right?

1398
01:24:44,781 --> 01:24:46,669
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1399
01:24:48,270 --> 01:24:49,578
Oh.

1400
01:24:49,741 --> 01:24:52,839
Wow, you have an actual
camel camel-toe.

1401
01:24:55,980 --> 01:24:57,868
Oh, it's not that funny.

1402
01:24:58,285 --> 01:24:59,911
She's having a little sand wedge.

1403
01:25:02,796 --> 01:25:04,389
Harry? Hi!

1404
01:25:04,557 --> 01:25:06,826
Harry, are you there?
I just fell off a camel.

1405
01:25:06,988 --> 01:25:08,166
Thank you, sir.

1406
01:25:08,333 --> 01:25:10,122
Did you get my texts?

1407
01:25:11,821 --> 01:25:16,075
<i>It is amazing how much food and clothing
four butlers can fit into four Maybachs.</i>

1408
01:25:16,236 --> 01:25:18,123
- Thanks.
- Enjoy.

1409
01:25:19,820 --> 01:25:21,313
Gorgeous.

1410
01:25:21,484 --> 01:25:24,353
To Fouad and Marzouk and...

1411
01:25:24,523 --> 01:25:26,433
- Hatimi.
- Hatimi.

1412
01:25:26,604 --> 01:25:27,585
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1413
01:25:41,931 --> 01:25:44,299
My apologies, ladies,
for disturbing your fun.

1414
01:25:44,972 --> 01:25:48,746
Gaurau, my friend, if you would do me
the kindness of calling the hotel...

1415
01:25:48,908 --> 01:25:51,973
telling them I'll be an hour or two late.

1416
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:53,765
My pleasure, sir.

1417
01:25:53,930 --> 01:25:55,971
What's the sense
in a boring business dinner...

1418
01:25:56,139 --> 01:25:58,311
when you have sand dunes
and sunset?

1419
01:25:59,563 --> 01:26:00,610
Am I right?

1420
01:26:24,330 --> 01:26:25,737
You all saw that, right?

1421
01:26:25,899 --> 01:26:26,946
Well, I sure did.

1422
01:26:27,530 --> 01:26:28,871
Who's Lawrence of Arabia?

1423
01:26:29,034 --> 01:26:32,350
He's a Danish architect who stays
at the hotel each time he's in Abu Dhabi.

1424
01:26:32,521 --> 01:26:35,390
- Very nice man.
- Very hot man.

1425
01:26:35,561 --> 01:26:39,817
Well, ladies, I am definitely feeling
something down under.

1426
01:26:40,649 --> 01:26:43,236
- No, don't, don't.
- And he's staying at our hotel.

1427
01:26:44,714 --> 01:26:47,014
Lawrence of my labia.

1428
01:26:56,201 --> 01:26:59,649
<i> It feels like the first time</i>

1429
01:26:59,816 --> 01:27:04,007
 It feels like the very first time

1430
01:27:04,168 --> 01:27:08,194
 It feels like the first time

1431
01:27:08,361 --> 01:27:11,742
 It feels like the very first time

1432
01:27:18,759 --> 01:27:21,215
Karaoke in the U.S., tired.

1433
01:27:21,384 --> 01:27:24,231
Karaoke in the Middle East, fresh.

1434
01:27:24,775 --> 01:27:29,086
Now, why are those women allowed
to show their bellies and chests?

1435
01:27:29,256 --> 01:27:33,315
Well, from my research, there's some
kind of nightclub-belly-dancer loophole.

1436
01:27:33,479 --> 01:27:37,156
Oh, those clever religious men.

1437
01:27:37,319 --> 01:27:40,134
<i>Oh, excuse me. I mean, marhaba.</i>

1438
01:27:44,935 --> 01:27:47,553
Okay. Could we get another round
of champagne?

1439
01:27:47,719 --> 01:27:48,733
- Okay.
- Okay.

1440
01:27:48,904 --> 01:27:50,212
<i>Shukran very much.</i>

1441
01:27:50,375 --> 01:27:53,311
Another round?
You are fun in Abu Dhabi.

1442
01:27:53,479 --> 01:27:55,650
- I'm fun in New York.
- Not for the last two years.

1443
01:27:55,815 --> 01:27:59,328
Oh, really?
You think I'm fun now? Just wait.

1444
01:27:59,911 --> 01:28:03,489
 It feels like the very first time

1445
01:28:03,974 --> 01:28:04,989
Give it up, people.

1446
01:28:05,159 --> 01:28:09,152
Give it up, Abu Dhabi.
He's working hard, hard, hard for you.

1447
01:28:09,990 --> 01:28:13,187
Next we have four girls from America.

1448
01:28:14,277 --> 01:28:16,700
Ladies, you have to come
to the stage now, please, oh.

1449
01:28:17,062 --> 01:28:18,191
Put your hands together.

1450
01:28:18,192 --> 01:28:20,992
- Come on, let's go.
- It'll be fun. It'll be fun.

1451
01:28:21,061 --> 01:28:22,654
We are waiting for you, America.

1452
01:28:23,654 --> 01:28:25,759
What song did you pick?
What if I don't know it?

1453
01:28:25,925 --> 01:28:28,676
- Trust me, you know the song.
- Are those ours?

1454
01:28:28,838 --> 01:28:31,171
They're going to sing for us.

1455
01:28:36,037 --> 01:28:37,020
<i> I am w...</i>

1456
01:28:37,189 --> 01:28:39,807
- No, no, no. Not yet.
- Wait for it.

1457
01:28:40,294 --> 01:28:41,439
Now. Now we come in.

1458
01:28:41,606 --> 01:28:43,745
<i> I am woman, hear me roar</i>

1459
01:28:43,909 --> 01:28:46,778
 In numbers too big to ignore

1460
01:28:46,949 --> 01:28:52,131
 And I know too much
To go back and pretend

1461
01:28:52,293 --> 01:28:54,748
 'Cause I've heard it all before

1462
01:28:54,917 --> 01:28:57,633
 And I've been down
there on that floor

1463
01:28:57,796 --> 01:29:02,717
 And no one's ever gonna
Keep me down again

1464
01:29:02,885 --> 01:29:06,201
 No
Yes, I am wise

1465
01:29:06,372 --> 01:29:09,187
 But it's wisdom born of pain

1466
01:29:09,349 --> 01:29:11,454
 Yes, I paid the price

1467
01:29:11,620 --> 01:29:13,825
 But look how much I've gained

1468
01:29:13,989 --> 01:29:19,073
 If I have to
I can do anything

1469
01:29:19,237 --> 01:29:21,625
 I am strong
Strong

1470
01:29:21,796 --> 01:29:25,178
 I am invincible
Invincible

1471
01:29:25,348 --> 01:29:29,210
 I am woman

1472
01:29:29,891 --> 01:29:32,346
- Pretty good, huh?
- Yeah.

1473
01:29:32,995 --> 01:29:35,036
Everyone!

1474
01:29:36,260 --> 01:29:38,048
 Standing toe to toe

1475
01:29:38,211 --> 01:29:43,613
 As I spread my loving arms
Across the land

1476
01:29:43,779 --> 01:29:46,779
 I am still an embryo

1477
01:29:46,947 --> 01:29:49,151
 With a long, long way to go

1478
01:29:49,315 --> 01:29:54,432
 Until I make my brother understand

1479
01:29:54,595 --> 01:29:57,115
 Oh, yes
I am wise

1480
01:29:57,283 --> 01:29:59,771
 But it's wisdom born of pain

1481
01:29:59,939 --> 01:30:02,459
 Yes, I've paid the price

1482
01:30:02,627 --> 01:30:05,561
 But look how much I've gained

1483
01:30:05,731 --> 01:30:10,587
 If I have to
I can do anything

1484
01:30:10,754 --> 01:30:13,209
 I am strong
Strong

1485
01:30:13,379 --> 01:30:16,095
 I am invincible
Invincible

1486
01:30:16,258 --> 01:30:18,363
 I am strong
Strong

1487
01:30:18,530 --> 01:30:21,530
 I am invincible
Invincible

1488
01:30:21,699 --> 01:30:26,815
 I am woman

1489
01:30:32,706 --> 01:30:35,456
Those are the American women.
I heard them roar.

1490
01:30:35,618 --> 01:30:37,211
Oh, my goodness.

1491
01:30:38,978 --> 01:30:43,385
 I am a woman

1492
01:30:44,449 --> 01:30:48,279
 I got that table

1493
01:31:00,929 --> 01:31:04,409
- That was quite a performance.
- Oh, you haven't seen anything yet.

1494
01:31:05,569 --> 01:31:07,226
- Hello again.
- Hi.

1495
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:10,741
Allow me to properly introduce myself.
My name is Rikard Spirt.

1496
01:31:10,912 --> 01:31:12,984
Rikard. Isn't that "Richard"?

1497
01:31:13,152 --> 01:31:16,535
- In Danish, yes.
- So your name is Dick Spirt?

1498
01:31:18,752 --> 01:31:20,923
Could you be any more American?

1499
01:31:21,088 --> 01:31:22,332
I don't think so.

1500
01:31:25,215 --> 01:31:26,808
Care to join me for a drink?

1501
01:31:26,976 --> 01:31:30,456
Oh, I can't tonight. It's girls' night out.

1502
01:31:30,624 --> 01:31:32,729
But I do have tomorrow free...

1503
01:31:32,895 --> 01:31:34,805
all day and night.

1504
01:31:34,976 --> 01:31:38,171
Perhaps you'd be open for a late dinner.

1505
01:31:40,415 --> 01:31:41,561
I'd be open.

1506
01:31:43,519 --> 01:31:44,763
You're very funny...

1507
01:31:45,471 --> 01:31:46,845
Samantha.

1508
01:31:47,007 --> 01:31:49,560
- Ladies.
- Good night.

1509
01:31:51,551 --> 01:31:52,827
Wow.

1510
01:31:53,151 --> 01:31:54,645
I gotta hand it to you, Samantha.

1511
01:31:54,816 --> 01:31:58,230
Not blowing us off for a guy
in your condition...

1512
01:31:58,399 --> 01:31:59,774
very classy.

1513
01:31:59,935 --> 01:32:02,390
Well, we made a deal ages ago.

1514
01:32:02,558 --> 01:32:05,276
Men, babies, doesn't matter.

1515
01:32:05,439 --> 01:32:06,649
We're soul mates.

1516
01:32:08,798 --> 01:32:12,628
<i>It was the perfect
end to a perfect day.</i>

1517
01:32:20,286 --> 01:32:22,140
- Good morning.
- Good morning, miss.

1518
01:32:22,302 --> 01:32:23,472
Where is everyone?

1519
01:32:23,473 --> 01:32:25,373
Oh, they're having breakfast
on the terrace.

1520
01:32:30,334 --> 01:32:31,960
Is this Samantha's? May I?

1521
01:32:32,125 --> 01:32:33,303
As you wish.

1522
01:32:33,470 --> 01:32:34,647
Thanks.

1523
01:32:45,821 --> 01:32:50,611
"And on and on, one by one, she
lampoons the traditional wedding vows".

1524
01:32:50,781 --> 01:32:52,090
Yeah. It's a satire.

1525
01:32:52,253 --> 01:32:53,365
And it's hilarious.

1526
01:32:54,173 --> 01:32:59,640
"Until the talented Bradshaw is better able
to grasp the complexities of married life...

1527
01:33:00,252 --> 01:33:02,107
she would be better advised...

1528
01:33:02,269 --> 01:33:05,334
to explore the vow of silence".

1529
01:33:05,501 --> 01:33:06,450
Ugh!

1530
01:33:06,621 --> 01:33:08,824
And he would be better advised
to go fuck himself.

1531
01:33:08,988 --> 01:33:10,482
God.

1532
01:33:10,653 --> 01:33:12,628
<i>The New Yorker.</i>

1533
01:33:12,796 --> 01:33:17,204
I have been carrying it around
in my purse for 20 years.

1534
01:33:17,883 --> 01:33:20,567
And to make it worse,
they turned me into a cartoon...

1535
01:33:20,732 --> 01:33:22,804
and slapped tape across my mouth.

1536
01:33:22,972 --> 01:33:24,053
Take it as a compliment.

1537
01:33:24,220 --> 01:33:27,481
You have a strong female voice
and this guy is intimidated.

1538
01:33:28,699 --> 01:33:32,562
You know, I'm just realizing, it wasn't
my tone of voice that my boss didn't like.

1539
01:33:32,732 --> 01:33:34,587
It was the fact that I had a voice.

1540
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:37,915
Men in the U.S. pretend they're comfortable
with strong women...

1541
01:33:38,076 --> 01:33:41,720
but really, a lot of them would prefer us
eating french fries behind our veils.

1542
01:33:41,883 --> 01:33:43,825
- Word.
- I should've just stuck to writing...

1543
01:33:43,995 --> 01:33:46,200
about what I know: Being single.

1544
01:33:46,363 --> 01:33:47,640
But you're not.

1545
01:33:47,803 --> 01:33:49,713
No, I'm married,
and Big wants two days off.

1546
01:33:49,883 --> 01:33:51,639
- I thought you both wanted...
- Charlotte.

1547
01:33:52,795 --> 01:33:55,893
Well, there'll be other reviews.
Fabulous reviews.

1548
01:33:56,282 --> 01:33:58,966
No. But right now,
I need you to go shopping.

1549
01:33:59,419 --> 01:34:01,392
We have to find me something
for my date.

1550
01:34:01,563 --> 01:34:04,879
Something sexy that doesn't show
my tits, arms or belly.

1551
01:34:06,203 --> 01:34:08,341
- I think I'm gonna take a walk.
- What about our spa day?

1552
01:34:08,506 --> 01:34:11,321
I'm not in the mood. Not in the mood.
But you guys go, have fun.

1553
01:34:11,483 --> 01:34:13,174
Okay, I'll see you later.

1554
01:34:14,586 --> 01:34:16,441
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1555
01:34:17,018 --> 01:34:19,865
- We have dinner reservations at 8.
- Yeah.

1556
01:34:24,185 --> 01:34:25,560
Miss?

1557
01:34:25,722 --> 01:34:27,577
I'm going out.

1558
01:34:30,138 --> 01:34:32,723
I don't know how she got ahold of it.

1559
01:34:33,082 --> 01:34:34,903
No more yams.

1560
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:49,176
Is there anything you'd like to do, miss?

1561
01:34:49,337 --> 01:34:51,224
No, thank you.

1562
01:34:53,721 --> 01:34:56,274
I think I'm gonna walk ahead, by myself.

1563
01:35:02,168 --> 01:35:05,234
<i>I walked along the Abu Dhabi beach.</i>

1564
01:35:05,977 --> 01:35:09,554
<i>I had never felt so
far away from home.</i>

1565
01:35:10,329 --> 01:35:13,078
<i>Or from myself.</i>

1566
01:35:49,719 --> 01:35:51,060
- Hi.
- Hi.

1567
01:35:51,223 --> 01:35:53,197
We missed you at the spa.
How was your day?

1568
01:35:53,367 --> 01:35:55,734
- It was good.
- Wow, you look great.

1569
01:35:56,406 --> 01:35:58,098
I'm meeting Aidan for dinner.

1570
01:35:58,551 --> 01:36:01,746
Oh, okay.
We'll change our reservation to 5, then.

1571
01:36:01,910 --> 01:36:04,431
No, we're okay with four.
Samantha's got that late date.

1572
01:36:04,598 --> 01:36:07,413
Not necessary,
because we're having dinner at his hotel.

1573
01:36:08,023 --> 01:36:09,070
At his hotel.

1574
01:36:09,238 --> 01:36:11,759
Yeah. There's a great Middle Eastern
place there.

1575
01:36:11,926 --> 01:36:15,539
It has the best, I don't know, something.

1576
01:36:15,990 --> 01:36:19,535
- Why are you having dinner with him?
- How can I not have dinner with him?

1577
01:36:19,702 --> 01:36:22,735
We bump into each other
halfway around the world?

1578
01:36:22,901 --> 01:36:25,619
- I mean, it means something.
- It doesn't mean anything.

1579
01:36:26,839 --> 01:36:28,049
Are you serious?

1580
01:36:28,214 --> 01:36:32,490
You have been saying that everything
means something for the last 20 years.

1581
01:36:32,661 --> 01:36:36,817
<i>But seeing Aidan at a spice souk
in the Middle East means nothing.</i>

1582
01:36:38,581 --> 01:36:40,436
I think you're playing with fire.

1583
01:36:40,597 --> 01:36:44,689
Oh, my God. Now I'm playing with fire?
All right, you've gone crazy.

1584
01:36:44,853 --> 01:36:47,952
Seriously, you're crazy in Abu Dhabi.

1585
01:36:48,116 --> 01:36:52,110
Just because you're worried about
your marriage, everyone's gonna cheat.

1586
01:36:52,277 --> 01:36:53,553
Have a good time at dinner.

1587
01:36:57,076 --> 01:36:58,506
You okay?

1588
01:36:58,677 --> 01:37:01,993
Yeah. I'm just really, really tired.
I'm gonna take a nap.

1589
01:37:02,164 --> 01:37:03,888
Take a nice, long nap.

1590
01:37:04,053 --> 01:37:05,613
And then I'll buy you a drink.

1591
01:37:06,516 --> 01:37:07,694
How's 9 sound?

1592
01:37:07,861 --> 01:37:09,290
- Okay.
- Okay.

1593
01:37:25,428 --> 01:37:27,021
Hi.

1594
01:37:28,691 --> 01:37:30,186
Hi.

1595
01:37:34,388 --> 01:37:35,370
Miss Hobbes.

1596
01:37:35,540 --> 01:37:39,053
I thought,
"Why go to a bar when we have a bar?"

1597
01:37:39,892 --> 01:37:41,517
Thank you.

1598
01:37:42,803 --> 01:37:44,494
Thank you, Resir. You can go.

1599
01:37:46,099 --> 01:37:47,277
How was your nap?

1600
01:37:47,443 --> 01:37:48,491
I slept hard.

1601
01:37:48,659 --> 01:37:51,888
You needed it.
Being a mother kicks your ass.

1602
01:37:52,051 --> 01:37:55,084
Yes, but the benefits make it worth it.

1603
01:37:58,739 --> 01:38:00,265
Okay.

1604
01:38:01,938 --> 01:38:05,867
- We're 6700 miles away from everyone.
- Mm-hm.

1605
01:38:06,034 --> 01:38:09,198
- You can say it to me. I'm a mother too.
- Say what?

1606
01:38:09,362 --> 01:38:13,388
All the things you're thinking, but you
won't allow yourself to say out loud.

1607
01:38:13,874 --> 01:38:15,881
Okay. I'll go first.

1608
01:38:18,417 --> 01:38:20,785
As much as I love Brady...

1609
01:38:20,946 --> 01:38:24,393
and I do love him more than words...

1610
01:38:25,171 --> 01:38:28,585
being a mother is not enough.

1611
01:38:30,002 --> 01:38:31,212
I miss my job.

1612
01:38:35,025 --> 01:38:38,886
You're not gonna leave me hanging out
feeling like the worst mother, are you?

1613
01:38:39,057 --> 01:38:40,683
Okay.

1614
01:38:43,921 --> 01:38:45,414
Well...

1615
01:38:47,089 --> 01:38:49,740
- I love my girls.
- I know that.

1616
01:38:49,905 --> 01:38:51,279
But...

1617
01:38:52,208 --> 01:38:55,624
I have enjoyed not having them around.

1618
01:38:55,952 --> 01:38:58,341
- I needed a break.
- Yes, you did.

1619
01:38:59,313 --> 01:39:03,918
Rose cries all day, every day.

1620
01:39:04,081 --> 01:39:05,673
It's driving me crazy.

1621
01:39:05,841 --> 01:39:08,524
I have been watching you.
I don't know how you're doing it.

1622
01:39:08,689 --> 01:39:11,884
Sometimes I go in the other room
and I close the door...

1623
01:39:12,048 --> 01:39:14,253
and I just let her scream.
Isn't that awful?

1624
01:39:14,417 --> 01:39:16,587
No, that's survival. Take a sip.

1625
01:39:20,688 --> 01:39:22,281
And can I tell you something else?

1626
01:39:22,448 --> 01:39:23,462
I feel guilty.

1627
01:39:23,632 --> 01:39:27,309
I feel so guilty, because all I ever prayed
for was to have a family.

1628
01:39:27,472 --> 01:39:29,958
And now I have these two beautiful girls.

1629
01:39:30,128 --> 01:39:31,241
And?

1630
01:39:31,408 --> 01:39:35,052
- They're driving me crazy.
- Take a sip.

1631
01:39:37,999 --> 01:39:39,723
And I feel like I'm failing.

1632
01:39:39,888 --> 01:39:42,789
I just feel like I'm failing all the time.

1633
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:44,007
You're not failing.

1634
01:39:44,175 --> 01:39:45,964
Being a mother is hard.

1635
01:39:46,127 --> 01:39:48,102
Oh, my God. It is so hard.

1636
01:39:48,623 --> 01:39:50,565
And I have full-time help.

1637
01:39:50,735 --> 01:39:53,484
How do the women without help do it?

1638
01:39:53,646 --> 01:39:56,264
I have no fucking idea.

1639
01:39:56,719 --> 01:39:58,574
- To them.
- To them.

1640
01:40:01,455 --> 01:40:02,764
And when I...

1641
01:40:02,927 --> 01:40:05,196
Oh, no, I can't. I can't. It's awful.

1642
01:40:05,359 --> 01:40:06,406
Sip.

1643
01:40:09,230 --> 01:40:10,692
Go.

1644
01:40:11,790 --> 01:40:14,507
When I heard Samantha say...

1645
01:40:14,670 --> 01:40:17,518
that Harry was gonna cheat on me
with Erin...

1646
01:40:17,678 --> 01:40:19,140
Yeah.

1647
01:40:19,310 --> 01:40:22,506
my first thought was:

1648
01:40:22,990 --> 01:40:24,900
"I can't lose the nanny".

1649
01:40:31,437 --> 01:40:34,372
We really should eat something.

1650
01:40:39,565 --> 01:40:42,565
I'm happy for you. For both of you.

1651
01:40:43,246 --> 01:40:45,067
Thank you.

1652
01:40:45,709 --> 01:40:46,789
That means a lot.

1653
01:40:48,717 --> 01:40:51,400
I have a confession to make.

1654
01:40:52,077 --> 01:40:53,506
I already knew you were married.

1655
01:40:54,157 --> 01:40:56,742
You let me go through all that?

1656
01:40:57,773 --> 01:41:00,871
Yeah, my wife showed me something
on the internet.

1657
01:41:01,037 --> 01:41:05,380
You know, she always kind of kept
one eye on you, the one that got away.

1658
01:41:14,317 --> 01:41:15,298
How is Kathy?

1659
01:41:15,725 --> 01:41:19,205
She's great. She's really amazing.

1660
01:41:20,395 --> 01:41:23,712
Her fabric business is through the roof,
even with the three boys.

1661
01:41:24,429 --> 01:41:26,795
- Oh, my God. Three?
- Yeah.

1662
01:41:26,956 --> 01:41:28,811
Homer, Wyatt and Tate.

1663
01:41:29,164 --> 01:41:30,756
Sounds like a country-music band.

1664
01:41:30,924 --> 01:41:32,833
Here's hoping.

1665
01:41:37,835 --> 01:41:39,591
Tate.

1666
01:41:42,955 --> 01:41:44,712
Wow. Aidan, they're amazing.

1667
01:41:44,875 --> 01:41:47,014
Yeah, they're good boys.

1668
01:41:47,179 --> 01:41:49,066
We're really lucky.

1669
01:41:51,818 --> 01:41:53,477
What about you?

1670
01:41:53,642 --> 01:41:54,755
Not in the cards?

1671
01:41:54,922 --> 01:41:56,449
I don't know.

1672
01:41:56,618 --> 01:42:00,328
We've talked about it a lot
and both love kids, but...

1673
01:42:02,986 --> 01:42:04,676
that's not who we are.

1674
01:42:04,843 --> 01:42:08,159
Yeah, doesn't surprise me.
You're anything but traditional.

1675
01:42:08,330 --> 01:42:10,720
I learned that when I tried
to get you to wear a ring.

1676
01:42:10,890 --> 01:42:13,159
Exactly. And see? Still:

1677
01:42:14,602 --> 01:42:16,425
No diamond.

1678
01:42:17,066 --> 01:42:18,789
- And I'm married.
- Man...

1679
01:42:18,953 --> 01:42:21,856
that was my big mistake.
Trying to get a rock on you.

1680
01:42:25,034 --> 01:42:26,441
You're not like other women.

1681
01:42:28,713 --> 01:42:31,364
Man, are you not.

1682
01:42:35,977 --> 01:42:38,115
Fuck, you look good.

1683
01:42:38,857 --> 01:42:42,567
You look hot. I'm sorry, but you do.

1684
01:42:47,369 --> 01:42:49,671
<i>Did you enjoy the muhammara?</i>

1685
01:42:51,369 --> 01:42:53,857
<i>That is the best muhammara
I've ever had.</i>

1686
01:42:55,817 --> 01:42:57,759
There's seven arches.

1687
01:42:57,929 --> 01:43:01,670
One to represent each
of the different Arab Emirates.

1688
01:43:01,832 --> 01:43:05,630
I memorize a different state
every time I come. I'm up to four now.

1689
01:43:05,992 --> 01:43:08,065
I got Abu Dhabi, Ajman...

1690
01:43:08,232 --> 01:43:11,527
Dubai and, um, hold on...

1691
01:43:27,368 --> 01:43:28,349
I'm sorry.

1692
01:43:28,616 --> 01:43:30,306
No, I'm sorry.

1693
01:43:30,471 --> 01:43:33,286
- Oh, fuck.
- Yeah, I should go.

1694
01:43:33,447 --> 01:43:34,789
I'm going. Bye.

1695
01:43:38,727 --> 01:43:39,709
Is this the way?

1696
01:43:55,335 --> 01:43:57,506
- How was your dinner, miss?
- Yeah.

1697
01:44:00,007 --> 01:44:01,861
- I kissed Aidan.
- I knew it.

1698
01:44:02,022 --> 01:44:03,680
I know you knew it.

1699
01:44:03,847 --> 01:44:05,155
I played with fire.

1700
01:44:05,574 --> 01:44:09,022
I'm so mad at myself.
Is Samantha still here? I need everybody.

1701
01:44:09,191 --> 01:44:11,361
She's getting ready for her date.

1702
01:44:15,526 --> 01:44:16,671
Samantha!

1703
01:44:17,478 --> 01:44:19,137
In here.

1704
01:44:20,838 --> 01:44:23,969
I kissed Aidan.
I'm freaking out. I need to talk.

1705
01:44:24,134 --> 01:44:25,541
I'm coming right out.

1706
01:44:25,702 --> 01:44:28,833
Paula, I need a towel.

1707
01:44:32,037 --> 01:44:34,427
One minute, he was naming
the Arab Emirates...

1708
01:44:34,597 --> 01:44:37,183
and then, all of a sudden, we kissed.

1709
01:44:37,349 --> 01:44:41,277
- Did he kiss you? Or did you kiss him?
- No, both. Both equally guilty.

1710
01:44:43,973 --> 01:44:47,519
- Yeah, I wanna call Big and tell him.
- Let's just calm down for a second.

1711
01:44:47,685 --> 01:44:51,297
No, really. I don't want the secret.
The secret to me makes it much worse.

1712
01:44:51,461 --> 01:44:55,106
So the sooner I tell him, the quicker,
the less damage it will do.

1713
01:44:55,269 --> 01:44:58,268
I mean, we're eight hours ahead
of New York. This is the future.

1714
01:44:58,437 --> 01:45:00,803
It hasn't really even happened there yet.

1715
01:45:03,045 --> 01:45:05,281
Well, now I'm crazy in Abu Dhabi.

1716
01:45:05,444 --> 01:45:08,029
So, what do you think? Should I call him?

1717
01:45:08,197 --> 01:45:09,757
I don't know.

1718
01:45:09,924 --> 01:45:11,930
I don't know.

1719
01:45:12,324 --> 01:45:14,593
I don't know.

1720
01:45:15,492 --> 01:45:17,052
I'm a little drunk.

1721
01:45:17,220 --> 01:45:20,700
When Steve told me he cheated on me,
I was devastated.

1722
01:45:20,868 --> 01:45:23,682
But now that I know
it was only that one time...

1723
01:45:23,843 --> 01:45:26,527
- Yeah?
- Was the pain worth it?

1724
01:45:26,692 --> 01:45:29,594
- I don't know.
- Yeah. I don't know.

1725
01:45:29,764 --> 01:45:31,421
Let's get something straight here.

1726
01:45:31,588 --> 01:45:32,995
Steve had sex.

1727
01:45:33,316 --> 01:45:34,745
I'm sorry, but he did.

1728
01:45:34,916 --> 01:45:37,468
And this was just a kiss.
A kiss is nothing.

1729
01:45:37,636 --> 01:45:39,774
- A kiss with Aidan.
- It was a kiss.

1730
01:45:39,938 --> 01:45:42,273
- We have a history.
- It was just a kiss.

1731
01:45:42,435 --> 01:45:44,158
Say nothing.

1732
01:45:44,739 --> 01:45:45,819
I am gonna tell him.

1733
01:45:48,579 --> 01:45:50,139
Do me a favor...

1734
01:45:50,306 --> 01:45:52,445
and sleep on it.

1735
01:46:04,514 --> 01:46:06,423
<i>Your first sheesha experience.</i>

1736
01:46:06,946 --> 01:46:09,367
This is very exciting.

1737
01:46:09,538 --> 01:46:12,157
You put this pipe in your mouth...

1738
01:46:12,321 --> 01:46:14,394
And suck?

1739
01:46:20,257 --> 01:46:22,013
You are a natural.

1740
01:46:35,361 --> 01:46:38,295
I think you have another audience.

1741
01:46:44,737 --> 01:46:47,355
Abu Dhabi is so cutting-edge
in so many ways...

1742
01:46:47,521 --> 01:46:49,692
and so backward
when it comes to sex.

1743
01:46:49,857 --> 01:46:51,832
And the paradox is...

1744
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:56,408
I find myself to be most aroused
on my trips here.

1745
01:46:56,578 --> 01:46:58,235
Do tell.

1746
01:47:00,032 --> 01:47:04,953
If we were in, say, Paris,
or Madrid, right now...

1747
01:47:08,928 --> 01:47:12,954
I would be having my hand down
your blouse, brushing your nipples.

1748
01:47:14,240 --> 01:47:17,502
But here, such things are forbidden.

1749
01:47:17,855 --> 01:47:20,823
And it's like being a boy again.

1750
01:47:24,512 --> 01:47:25,919
And are you a big boy?

1751
01:47:36,159 --> 01:47:37,206
Walk on the beach?

1752
01:47:37,695 --> 01:47:39,037
Oh, yes.

1753
01:47:39,199 --> 01:47:41,620
I need a walk on the beach.

1754
01:47:56,478 --> 01:47:59,260
Your top seems to have come undone.

1755
01:48:32,318 --> 01:48:35,547
Well, it's 2:30 am. there.
You still can't be jet-lagged.

1756
01:48:35,710 --> 01:48:37,498
Hi.

1757
01:48:38,270 --> 01:48:39,514
Something happened.

1758
01:48:40,029 --> 01:48:41,916
<i>- Are you okay?
- Yes. Yes.</i>

1759
01:48:42,077 --> 01:48:46,485
Nothing accident-wise or anything.

1760
01:48:46,653 --> 01:48:48,312
But it was an accident.

1761
01:48:48,477 --> 01:48:50,997
What happened? Are you physically okay?

1762
01:48:51,165 --> 01:48:53,020
<i>Yes, I'm...</i>

1763
01:48:53,629 --> 01:48:55,484
I'm fine.

1764
01:48:56,509 --> 01:49:01,560
I, uh, went to the spice market...

1765
01:49:01,724 --> 01:49:03,699
and I ran into Aidan.

1766
01:49:05,917 --> 01:49:08,338
<i>- Hello?
- Yes?</i>

1767
01:49:08,508 --> 01:49:12,152
<i>And we decided to have dinner...</i>

1768
01:49:12,317 --> 01:49:18,546
because it was so strange
to see each other there.

1769
01:49:19,068 --> 01:49:24,851
And at dinner we were talking about
how happy we were in our marriages and...

1770
01:49:25,020 --> 01:49:29,690
<i>And when we went to say goodbye...</i>

1771
01:49:30,556 --> 01:49:32,344
somehow...

1772
01:49:35,227 --> 01:49:36,210
we kissed.

1773
01:49:38,523 --> 01:49:41,338
<i>It didn't mean anything...</i>

1774
01:49:41,498 --> 01:49:43,921
and it lasted only a second.

1775
01:49:44,091 --> 01:49:46,742
And I'm sick about it.

1776
01:49:46,906 --> 01:49:50,256
<i>And the girls didn't know
if I should even tell you...</i>

1777
01:49:50,427 --> 01:49:52,980
<i>because it was just a kiss
and it means nothing.</i>

1778
01:49:53,146 --> 01:49:56,944
But I told them...

1779
01:49:57,114 --> 01:50:01,522
that I couldn't have a secret from you.
That we don't have secrets.

1780
01:50:01,691 --> 01:50:06,163
And the secret
would just make it worse. So...

1781
01:50:06,810 --> 01:50:09,776
So I'm telling you.

1782
01:50:11,930 --> 01:50:16,337
And I feel awful.

1783
01:50:20,058 --> 01:50:22,229
And I'm sorry.

1784
01:50:27,225 --> 01:50:29,265
<i>Please say something.</i>

1785
01:50:32,089 --> 01:50:33,333
I'm at work, Carrie.

1786
01:50:33,658 --> 01:50:35,218
<i>I have to go.</i>

1787
01:50:35,385 --> 01:50:37,011
<i>Goodbye.</i>

1788
01:50:53,337 --> 01:50:56,686
<i>- Hi. I was gonna call you back. I just...
- Carrie, this is outrageous.</i>

1789
01:50:56,856 --> 01:50:58,548
<i>- I've been arrested.
- Wait, wait, wait.</i>

1790
01:50:58,712 --> 01:51:01,168
<i>- Samantha, wait. What's wrong?
- You gotta get down here.</i>

1791
01:51:05,816 --> 01:51:06,864
Get up.

1792
01:51:07,032 --> 01:51:09,453
Samantha was arrested for having sex
on the beach.

1793
01:51:09,624 --> 01:51:11,697
She's at hotel security
and she needs a lawyer.

1794
01:51:11,864 --> 01:51:13,424
I'm on it.

1795
01:51:13,593 --> 01:51:15,186
No, no, no. That way.

1796
01:51:15,736 --> 01:51:18,224
We did not have sex.
We were just kissing.

1797
01:51:18,392 --> 01:51:22,003
And this uptight couple told
the security guard to arrest us.

1798
01:51:22,168 --> 01:51:24,786
See, kissing is something. It's illegal.

1799
01:51:26,328 --> 01:51:28,597
Oh, Mr. Safir,
thank you so much for coming.

1800
01:51:28,759 --> 01:51:31,541
I'm so sorry
about this unfortunate situation.

1801
01:51:31,703 --> 01:51:34,288
Ladies, if you don't mind waiting outside.

1802
01:51:34,456 --> 01:51:36,397
I'm her attorney. I'm gonna stay.

1803
01:51:36,984 --> 01:51:38,413
- Sure.
- We'll be right outside.

1804
01:51:44,087 --> 01:51:49,138
- It's all right.
- So, what is the severity of the situation?

1805
01:51:50,998 --> 01:51:54,708
The gentleman who reported the incident
is very conservative...

1806
01:51:54,871 --> 01:51:58,254
and has insisted the offending event
be recorded.

1807
01:51:58,678 --> 01:52:01,493
Offending event? It was kissing.

1808
01:52:01,654 --> 01:52:04,502
I understand your feelings.
But we will need your passport.

1809
01:52:04,662 --> 01:52:07,412
My passport? You gotta be kidding me.

1810
01:52:07,574 --> 01:52:10,869
It's just to make a record.
To satisfy the complaining gentleman.

1811
01:52:13,686 --> 01:52:16,141
This is outrageous.

1812
01:52:16,309 --> 01:52:17,292
I know. I know.

1813
01:52:18,422 --> 01:52:20,626
It was just a kiss.

1814
01:52:21,366 --> 01:52:22,859
Thank you.

1815
01:52:36,149 --> 01:52:38,058
I guess I really missed who I used to be...

1816
01:52:38,229 --> 01:52:41,643
and Aidan was such a big part
of that and...

1817
01:52:42,037 --> 01:52:44,720
Yes, I wanted the flirting,
and, yes, I wanted the attention.

1818
01:52:44,885 --> 01:52:46,445
But I didn't want the kiss.

1819
01:52:46,614 --> 01:52:49,101
The minute I kissed Aidan
I remembered who I used to be.

1820
01:52:49,269 --> 01:52:53,425
Someone just running around New York
like a crazy person...

1821
01:52:54,100 --> 01:52:56,522
trying to get the one man I loved
to love me back.

1822
01:52:58,133 --> 01:52:59,409
And now he does love me...

1823
01:52:59,572 --> 01:53:04,144
and he wants to sit on a couch
in New York City with me.

1824
01:53:07,892 --> 01:53:11,405
And I really hope my past hasn't
screwed up my future.

1825
01:53:13,716 --> 01:53:15,603
And what's so bad
about a couch anyway?

1826
01:53:19,284 --> 01:53:22,448
Oh, my God. I'm having a mid-wife crisis.

1827
01:53:27,156 --> 01:53:30,254
I should never have said anything to him.

1828
01:53:30,420 --> 01:53:34,315
<i>The New Yorker was right to slap
a big piece of tape across my mouth.</i>

1829
01:53:38,195 --> 01:53:41,643
And I'm sorry for that thing I said
about your marriage earlier.

1830
01:53:42,003 --> 01:53:43,377
I'm sorry too.

1831
01:53:43,539 --> 01:53:45,197
For what?

1832
01:53:45,683 --> 01:53:48,944
For having an attitude
about that two-day idea.

1833
01:53:49,747 --> 01:53:52,845
I've had two days away,
I've gotten a little sleep...

1834
01:53:53,011 --> 01:53:56,458
and I am finally starting
to feel like myself again.

1835
01:53:56,626 --> 01:53:59,441
I think there's really something to it.

1836
01:54:02,130 --> 01:54:03,177
Maybe.

1837
01:54:05,394 --> 01:54:08,590
Well, let's just hope Big
doesn't want seven days off.

1838
01:54:11,506 --> 01:54:14,288
<i>And as morning arrived,
so did Samantha's release.</i>

1839
01:54:14,450 --> 01:54:16,272
I am sorry it took me so long to arrive.

1840
01:54:16,435 --> 01:54:18,059
Well, you're here now, Mr. Mahmud.

1841
01:54:18,225 --> 01:54:20,876
I never got word
until I arrived at my office.

1842
01:54:21,043 --> 01:54:23,343
I'm sorry that you had to come
all the way out here.

1843
01:54:23,506 --> 01:54:26,156
- Well, it is all settled now.
- Thanks to you.

1844
01:54:26,801 --> 01:54:29,039
- Good to see you again, ladies.
- Thank you so much.

1845
01:54:29,553 --> 01:54:31,309
I'm starving.

1846
01:54:31,473 --> 01:54:34,375
Hello? What's for breakfast?

1847
01:54:34,545 --> 01:54:37,774
Abdul? Anybody?

1848
01:54:37,937 --> 01:54:40,654
Well, that's odd. Where are they?

1849
01:54:44,113 --> 01:54:45,608
- Hello?
- Miss Jones, please.

1850
01:54:46,354 --> 01:54:47,761
Samantha. It's the front desk.

1851
01:54:50,224 --> 01:54:52,462
<i>- This is Samantha Jones.
- Miss Jones.</i>

1852
01:54:52,625 --> 01:54:54,249
This is Beydoun at the front desk.

1853
01:54:54,417 --> 01:54:56,937
I will need a credit card number
for the room charges.

1854
01:54:57,552 --> 01:54:59,757
Beydoun, there must be some mistake.

1855
01:54:59,921 --> 01:55:04,011
I am a guest of Sheikh Khalid.
There is no room charge.

1856
01:55:04,176 --> 01:55:06,893
Yes, I have a record of that.
But not from today on.

1857
01:55:07,056 --> 01:55:10,701
What are you talking about? I have
a meeting with the sheikh on Tuesday.

1858
01:55:10,864 --> 01:55:15,141
Ah, yes. I have a note here
from Mr. Mahmud.

1859
01:55:15,311 --> 01:55:17,962
That meeting is no longer as well.

1860
01:55:19,440 --> 01:55:21,895
That sneaky bastard
has canceled the meeting...

1861
01:55:22,064 --> 01:55:24,398
and he wants us to pay
for the room from now on.

1862
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:27,974
We have you booked into the Jewel Suite
until Wednesday.

1863
01:55:28,143 --> 01:55:30,479
The charge is 22,000 per night.

1864
01:55:31,211 --> 01:55:34,259
The room is 22,000 dollars
a night.

1865
01:55:34,960 --> 01:55:36,869
- What?
- We can't pay that.

1866
01:55:38,192 --> 01:55:39,369
Let them sue me.

1867
01:55:39,535 --> 01:55:43,910
The punishment for not paying
your hotel bill in the UAE is jail.

1868
01:55:47,119 --> 01:55:48,493
What time is checkout?

1869
01:55:48,656 --> 01:55:50,249
In precisely one hour.

1870
01:55:51,790 --> 01:55:55,913
We have an hour to pack
and get the fuck out of Abu Dhabi.

1871
01:55:56,559 --> 01:55:57,573
What?

1872
01:55:57,743 --> 01:55:59,750
What do you mean...?

1873
01:56:01,294 --> 01:56:02,920
New Middle East, my ass.

1874
01:56:06,510 --> 01:56:10,633
Fucking Paula Abdul.
Where is she when you need him?

1875
01:56:13,006 --> 01:56:14,283
Samantha!

1876
01:56:19,822 --> 01:56:21,927
Samantha!

1877
01:56:22,094 --> 01:56:24,069
I can't be ready in an hour!

1878
01:56:24,238 --> 01:56:26,920
Then you better have
22,000 dollars a night!

1879
01:56:27,917 --> 01:56:29,128
Oh, my God.

1880
01:56:31,309 --> 01:56:33,284
All right. Okay.

1881
01:56:36,782 --> 01:56:39,269
I've got the bath products.

1882
01:56:41,902 --> 01:56:45,000
- Yes. Did you call about luggage?
- They're here for the luggage.

1883
01:56:45,165 --> 01:56:48,132
Okay. I'm coming.

1884
01:56:59,148 --> 01:57:04,004
Hi. I'm calling
to reconfirm four first-class tickets.

1885
01:57:04,172 --> 01:57:05,318
- Oh, Christ.
- Are you okay?

1886
01:57:05,484 --> 01:57:08,964
We were supposed to be
leaving on Tuesday, but...

1887
01:57:09,133 --> 01:57:10,726
Sir.

1888
01:57:10,892 --> 01:57:12,452
- Shorts?
- I no longer care.

1889
01:57:12,620 --> 01:57:15,882
I am going from here to a plane to America,
where legs are not the devil.

1890
01:57:16,044 --> 01:57:17,255
At least zip up the jacket.

1891
01:57:17,420 --> 01:57:20,235
I am having a hot flash in 119 degrees.
I may die.

1892
01:57:20,396 --> 01:57:21,705
- Yes, miss.
- Hello.

1893
01:57:21,868 --> 01:57:24,235
We called down for two cabs going
to the airport.

1894
01:57:24,396 --> 01:57:26,730
- Right away.
- Thank you.

1895
01:57:36,171 --> 01:57:38,855
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.

1896
01:57:39,019 --> 01:57:40,630
- Oh, my God!
- What?

1897
01:57:40,631 --> 01:57:42,400
I forgot to buy Harry
and the girls a gift.

1898
01:57:42,463 --> 01:57:45,348
- I gotta run to the gift shop.
- Get them at the airport.

1899
01:57:45,515 --> 01:57:48,679
How tacky. No, we have time.
The plane doesn't leave till 6.

1900
01:57:48,843 --> 01:57:51,712
Not chancing it. It's a miracle
I got these seats rebooked.

1901
01:57:51,883 --> 01:57:55,974
If anything goes wrong, we're flying back
13 and a half hours in coach.

1902
01:57:56,298 --> 01:57:57,989
Buy them some crap at the airport.

1903
01:57:59,051 --> 01:58:01,091
It's not here. My passport.

1904
01:58:01,258 --> 01:58:04,040
- Well, is it in another purse?
- No, no. I had it right here.

1905
01:58:04,202 --> 01:58:07,050
I had it right here next to my money
and the spices.

1906
01:58:07,914 --> 01:58:09,255
Well, they're not here either.

1907
01:58:12,938 --> 01:58:14,913
I left it where I bought the shoes.

1908
01:58:15,081 --> 01:58:18,376
I put it on the counter and then when
I saw Aidan I got distracted and I...

1909
01:58:18,538 --> 01:58:21,156
<i>- It's all right. It's okay.
- I have to go back to the souk.</i>

1910
01:58:21,321 --> 01:58:23,842
- What if it's not there?
- It will be there. It has to be.

1911
01:58:24,009 --> 01:58:25,220
- Miranda, go with me?
- Sure.

1912
01:58:25,385 --> 01:58:27,359
- We'll all go.
- You don't have to do that.

1913
01:58:27,530 --> 01:58:29,351
Yeah, like we'd dump you in Abu Dhabi.

1914
01:58:29,513 --> 01:58:32,929
Sir, we need to leave the bags here.
We'll come back for them.

1915
01:58:33,097 --> 01:58:36,261
No, no, no. Um, um. La, la, la, la.

1916
01:58:38,537 --> 01:58:40,163
No, no. No.

1917
01:58:40,329 --> 01:58:41,606
My nails!

1918
01:58:42,441 --> 01:58:44,678
No, sir. No! Not at all.
No. Not at all.

1919
01:58:44,841 --> 01:58:46,433
They're loading the other car!

1920
01:58:51,145 --> 01:58:53,828
Will you stop with the jacket?
You're flashing religious men.

1921
01:58:53,992 --> 01:58:56,000
I don't care,
I'm baking from the inside out.

1922
01:58:56,168 --> 01:58:57,728
How much farther?

1923
01:58:57,897 --> 01:59:00,580
There he is. Yeah, there he is.

1924
01:59:02,313 --> 01:59:04,614
Hello, sir. I was here the other day.

1925
01:59:04,777 --> 01:59:07,264
And I left a blue passport.

1926
01:59:10,536 --> 01:59:11,966
Yes!

1927
01:59:12,136 --> 01:59:14,721
Yes, that's me.
Oh, thank God. Thank Allah.

1928
01:59:16,615 --> 01:59:19,277
- Just please accept this...
- No, no, no.

1929
01:59:19,278 --> 01:59:20,778
- as a thank-you, sir.
- No, no, no.

1930
01:59:20,863 --> 01:59:21,863
Oh...

1931
01:59:21,864 --> 01:59:26,272
Oh, sir. Well, then, in that case,
shoes for everyone.

1932
01:59:26,599 --> 01:59:28,541
Okay, ladies, on me.
Quick, quick, quick.

1933
01:59:28,712 --> 01:59:29,889
Oh, thank you, sir.

1934
01:59:30,055 --> 01:59:32,510
So I think this...

1935
01:59:32,680 --> 01:59:35,614
should lead us right out
to Al Ben Abi Talib Street...

1936
01:59:35,783 --> 01:59:37,954
and we can get a cab back
to the hotel and go.

1937
01:59:38,119 --> 01:59:39,526
- And how are we for time?
- Good.

1938
01:59:41,798 --> 01:59:44,798
Hello, miss. Rolex? Special price.

1939
01:59:44,967 --> 01:59:46,428
Make beautiful gift for man.

1940
01:59:47,846 --> 01:59:50,945
- Do you have it in silver?
- Yes. Upstairs. Come.

1941
01:59:51,111 --> 01:59:52,704
- This one or this one.
- Not this one.

1942
01:59:52,871 --> 01:59:53,951
- Oh, craps.
- Wait!

1943
01:59:54,118 --> 01:59:56,290
- I think it's...
- Charlotte's buying a watch.

1944
01:59:56,455 --> 01:59:57,884
Miss.

1945
01:59:58,726 --> 01:59:59,806
- Welcome.
CARRIE: Excuse us.

1946
01:59:59,974 --> 02:00:02,843
- Ladies, come this way. Upstairs.
- Wait, wait, wait. Hello?

1947
02:00:04,678 --> 02:00:06,620
We're with them.

1948
02:00:07,046 --> 02:00:08,420
Them. Them.

1949
02:00:08,582 --> 02:00:09,989
Okay.

1950
02:00:12,934 --> 02:00:15,073
We have many designer bags.

1951
02:00:15,238 --> 02:00:17,725
- Right through there.
- Very good, very nice.

1952
02:00:17,894 --> 02:00:19,617
- You really enjoy this store.
- Yes.

1953
02:00:19,782 --> 02:00:21,723
- Please, have seat. Please.
- Very good.

1954
02:00:21,893 --> 02:00:23,649
- Yes.
- Welcome.

1955
02:00:23,813 --> 02:00:24,860
- Thank you.
- This is...

1956
02:00:26,534 --> 02:00:29,829
Carrie. This is the watch you gave Big,
right? This could be Harry's gift.

1957
02:00:30,150 --> 02:00:32,320
No. Mine was vintage.
We should go. We should go.

1958
02:00:32,485 --> 02:00:34,372
- We have ladies' watches too, huh?
- Yeah.

1959
02:00:34,533 --> 02:00:37,118
We really, really need to go right now.

1960
02:00:37,285 --> 02:00:39,195
Is there any air in here?

1961
02:00:39,365 --> 02:00:41,504
- I have many other kinds.
- No, I'm so sorry.

1962
02:00:41,668 --> 02:00:43,742
We're going to miss our plane,
so nothing.

1963
02:00:43,909 --> 02:00:45,087
Thank you. Thank you.

1964
02:00:45,252 --> 02:00:46,681
- Beautiful.
- You want watch, yes?

1965
02:00:46,852 --> 02:00:49,023
- No, no, no. She didn't want anything.
- No.

1966
02:00:49,189 --> 02:00:50,465
- Sorry.
- Thank you, though.

1967
02:00:50,628 --> 02:00:52,451
Go. Then go.

1968
02:00:53,220 --> 02:00:55,259
- We have to go.
- No, you have to put this on...

1969
02:00:55,429 --> 02:00:57,152
...before we go outside.
- You go.

1970
02:00:57,316 --> 02:00:58,778
- Sorry.
- No purse? No purse?

1971
02:00:58,948 --> 02:01:03,203
- Thank you, sir.
- No purse? Purse? No purse?

1972
02:01:10,020 --> 02:01:11,165
- It's forbidden.
- What?

1973
02:01:11,332 --> 02:01:12,826
It...

1974
02:01:15,236 --> 02:01:17,571
- What's that?
- It's the call to prayer.

1975
02:01:17,732 --> 02:01:18,877
Hey, lady!

1976
02:01:20,835 --> 02:01:23,683
Hey, you! Hey, you. I see you steal this.

1977
02:01:23,843 --> 02:01:25,631
- This is mine!
- I seen you take it!

1978
02:01:25,796 --> 02:01:27,900
I didn't steal it! It's mine!

1979
02:01:33,667 --> 02:01:35,423
You broke my Birkin!

1980
02:01:36,004 --> 02:01:37,312
Sorry. Mistake.

1981
02:01:49,923 --> 02:01:52,988
Condoms! Condoms, yes! Condoms!

1982
02:01:54,819 --> 02:01:57,437
- I have sex!
- Okay, okay.

1983
02:01:57,602 --> 02:01:59,707
- Samantha.
- Yes! Yes!

1984
02:02:02,914 --> 02:02:04,856
I have condoms!

1985
02:02:05,762 --> 02:02:07,169
Here they are!

1986
02:02:08,258 --> 02:02:09,240
Bite me!

1987
02:02:14,177 --> 02:02:17,341
- Bite me! Oh, bite me!
- No, no, no.

1988
02:02:20,034 --> 02:02:22,106
Go, go. Keep going.

1989
02:02:23,330 --> 02:02:24,955
Put your jacket on.

1990
02:02:25,122 --> 02:02:28,471
You're worried about getting old?
You're exactly the same as when I met you.

1991
02:02:28,641 --> 02:02:31,391
- Yes, I am. Good for me.
- Oh, they're following us.

1992
02:02:31,553 --> 02:02:34,488
Yes, because that was major disrespect.
And it's against the law.

1993
02:02:34,657 --> 02:02:36,829
- So, what do we do?
- Just keep walking and pray...

1994
02:02:36,993 --> 02:02:38,903
no one calls a cop.

1995
02:02:48,929 --> 02:02:51,001
I think they want us to follow them.

1996
02:02:54,977 --> 02:02:56,504
- I think we should.
- Okay, go.

1997
02:02:56,672 --> 02:02:57,949
Okay.

1998
02:03:09,216 --> 02:03:11,965
All right. All right. Here we go.

1999
02:03:18,335 --> 02:03:19,796
Hello.

2000
02:03:24,703 --> 02:03:26,612
You are welcome, you are welcome.

2001
02:03:29,919 --> 02:03:31,828
That was quite a show outside.

2002
02:03:31,999 --> 02:03:32,982
Terrible.

2003
02:03:33,151 --> 02:03:34,777
So disrespectful.

2004
02:03:34,943 --> 02:03:36,187
Yes.

2005
02:03:37,119 --> 02:03:38,363
I quite enjoyed it.

2006
02:03:39,006 --> 02:03:44,822
- And the men will be outraged for weeks.
- For months. Some, perhaps years.

2007
02:03:46,591 --> 02:03:49,143
Could I bother you for a glass of water?
I'm burning up.

2008
02:03:49,311 --> 02:03:51,165
- Yes.
- Hot flashes.

2009
02:03:52,927 --> 02:03:55,414
Yeah. She knows.

2010
02:03:55,583 --> 02:03:57,655
Have you read this?

2011
02:03:58,846 --> 02:04:01,660
We are discussing it
in our book club today.

2012
02:04:01,823 --> 02:04:03,383
- Suzanne Somers.
- Suzanne Somers.

2013
02:04:03,549 --> 02:04:04,956
- Suzanne Somers.
- Suzanne Somers.

2014
02:04:05,118 --> 02:04:07,060
Lady gets around.

2015
02:04:07,901 --> 02:04:08,981
They took my creams.

2016
02:04:11,774 --> 02:04:14,195
I take it you are visiting
from the United States?

2017
02:04:14,366 --> 02:04:17,300
- New York City.
- New York?

2018
02:04:19,837 --> 02:04:22,325
Carnegie Hall, Fifth Avenue.

2019
02:04:25,885 --> 02:04:27,314
You've been to New York?

2020
02:04:27,934 --> 02:04:29,591
No.

2021
02:04:30,301 --> 02:04:32,505
But we love the fashion.

2022
02:04:39,676 --> 02:04:41,018
- Louis Vuitton.
- Yes.

2023
02:04:41,181 --> 02:04:43,003
Yes.

2024
02:04:44,477 --> 02:04:48,852
<i>And there, in a dried-flower shop,
halfway across the world...</i>

2025
02:04:49,020 --> 02:04:51,605
<i>underneath hundreds of years
of tradition...</i>

2026
02:04:51,773 --> 02:04:54,074
<i>was this year's
spring collection.</i>

2027
02:04:54,236 --> 02:04:56,178
- So beautiful.
- So pretty.

2028
02:05:03,932 --> 02:05:07,347
- What'd she say? What'd she say?
- Something, something, Arab women.

2029
02:05:07,516 --> 02:05:10,996
Would you like anything to drink?
Coffee, tea? Anything, really.

2030
02:05:12,188 --> 02:05:15,222
Sorry. If we don't leave now,
we'll miss our flight.

2031
02:05:15,388 --> 02:05:18,422
But what about those angry men
out there?

2032
02:05:18,587 --> 02:05:20,922
How are we gonna get past them?

2033
02:05:25,820 --> 02:05:26,997
All clear.

2034
02:05:27,163 --> 02:05:28,886
This way.

2035
02:05:36,411 --> 02:05:38,265
It's this way.

2036
02:05:39,675 --> 02:05:41,530
Hey, where's Charlotte?

2037
02:05:41,851 --> 02:05:43,377
- She was behind you.
- No, I know.

2038
02:05:43,547 --> 02:05:47,343
I'm gonna fucking kill her. If we miss
that flight, we're flying home coach.

2039
02:05:47,515 --> 02:05:51,061
Shoes, the shoes. Look for her shoes.
She was wearing purple peep-toe platforms.

2040
02:05:51,226 --> 02:05:52,371
- Got it.
- Right.

2041
02:05:59,098 --> 02:06:00,854
There she is.

2042
02:06:02,074 --> 02:06:03,384
Charlotte!

2043
02:06:03,546 --> 02:06:05,782
Look! For the girls!

2044
02:06:06,458 --> 02:06:08,116
Taxi!

2045
02:06:09,977 --> 02:06:12,564
- Taxi!
- Don't women here take cabs?

2046
02:06:12,730 --> 02:06:14,104
Taxi!

2047
02:06:14,266 --> 02:06:17,812
Why won't they stop? We're out of time.
We're gonna get bumped from first class.

2048
02:06:17,978 --> 02:06:19,800
I can't be in menopause and in coach.

2049
02:06:21,082 --> 02:06:23,700
I have an idea. Hold this.

2050
02:06:23,865 --> 02:06:25,769
- What's she doing?
- I don't know.

2051
02:06:36,889 --> 02:06:38,197
- Oh, hurry.
- Get in.

2052
02:06:38,360 --> 02:06:40,302
- I'll get in the front.
- Thank you so much.

2053
02:06:40,373 --> 02:06:41,379
Thank you, sir.

2054
02:06:41,579 --> 02:06:42,479
Move over!

2055
02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:44,080
We're going to
the Taj Al Saharaa.

2056
02:06:53,305 --> 02:06:54,963
Thank you.

2057
02:06:58,520 --> 02:07:00,527
Do you have anything to declare?

2058
02:07:00,696 --> 02:07:02,550
Yes. I'm a mess.

2059
02:07:04,825 --> 02:07:06,548
Thank you.

2060
02:07:08,056 --> 02:07:10,391
Do you have anything to declare?

2061
02:07:11,511 --> 02:07:15,341
<i>Turns out, Big never met me
at the airport like he promised.</i>

2062
02:07:15,512 --> 02:07:17,879
- Thank you, William.
- No problem, Mrs. Preston.

2063
02:07:37,208 --> 02:07:38,833
John?

2064
02:07:42,359 --> 02:07:45,010
<i>No Big and no TV.</i>

2065
02:07:49,687 --> 02:07:51,476
- Here comes Mommy.
- Here comes Mommy.

2066
02:07:51,639 --> 02:07:53,778
- Hey, there she is.
- Mommy, hi.

2067
02:07:53,942 --> 02:07:56,910
- Let's say hello, let's say hello.
- Oh, I missed you so much.

2068
02:07:57,078 --> 02:07:59,860
- Hi! Baby Rose.
- Hello, my love.

2069
02:08:00,022 --> 02:08:03,056
- I missed you so much.
- Mommy.

2070
02:08:20,597 --> 02:08:23,445
<i>I can't pick up,
so please leave me a message.</i>

2071
02:08:23,605 --> 02:08:26,093
Hi, it's me. I'm home.

2072
02:08:26,422 --> 02:08:28,145
Where are you?

2073
02:08:57,652 --> 02:08:59,310
Hi.

2074
02:09:00,725 --> 02:09:02,186
Where you been all day?

2075
02:09:03,892 --> 02:09:05,801
Walking around.

2076
02:09:07,092 --> 02:09:08,915
Killing time.

2077
02:09:11,604 --> 02:09:12,748
Torturing you.

2078
02:09:14,356 --> 02:09:15,338
Well, it worked.

2079
02:09:16,788 --> 02:09:19,471
- I thought you weren't gonna come back.
- Oh, no.

2080
02:09:20,083 --> 02:09:21,993
I'm a grownup.

2081
02:09:22,419 --> 02:09:23,629
And I made a vow.

2082
02:09:24,628 --> 02:09:26,221
Remember?

2083
02:09:26,675 --> 02:09:28,585
Ever thine, ever mine.

2084
02:09:28,756 --> 02:09:30,097
Ever ours.

2085
02:09:38,707 --> 02:09:40,616
Just so you know...

2086
02:09:41,491 --> 02:09:43,313
that really tore me up.

2087
02:09:43,667 --> 02:09:45,609
I'm sorry.

2088
02:09:46,739 --> 02:09:49,324
You know, it seems to me
that you're a bit of a rookie...

2089
02:09:49,491 --> 02:09:51,661
when it comes
to this whole marriage idea.

2090
02:09:52,435 --> 02:09:54,507
And maybe in light of what happened...

2091
02:09:54,674 --> 02:09:57,708
until you get a better understanding
of what this is all about...

2092
02:09:57,874 --> 02:10:00,045
you need a little reminder.

2093
02:10:03,282 --> 02:10:05,703
This is your punishment.

2094
02:10:07,923 --> 02:10:11,784
You have to wear this every day
so that you remember...

2095
02:10:12,658 --> 02:10:13,640
you're married.

2096
02:10:15,153 --> 02:10:16,844
Gladly.

2097
02:10:18,834 --> 02:10:20,743
It dawned on me
when I was walking around...

2098
02:10:20,913 --> 02:10:24,328
that while you wrote
a funny book about vows...

2099
02:10:24,498 --> 02:10:27,759
you never actually wrote any vows
from you to me.

2100
02:10:28,433 --> 02:10:30,026
Oh, I did.

2101
02:10:30,194 --> 02:10:33,160
But then that wedding never happened.

2102
02:10:34,993 --> 02:10:37,644
I guess we all make stupid mistakes.

2103
02:10:40,561 --> 02:10:42,122
You were saying.

2104
02:10:42,288 --> 02:10:43,849
Vows.

2105
02:10:44,560 --> 02:10:47,594
I took the liberty of making up
some vows for you.

2106
02:10:47,760 --> 02:10:50,378
Repeat after me, please.

2107
02:10:50,544 --> 02:10:53,326
I will never kiss another man other
than my husband.

2108
02:10:53,488 --> 02:10:56,139
I will never kiss another man other
than my husband.

2109
02:10:56,304 --> 02:10:59,119
I will stop worrying
about being a boring old married couple...

2110
02:10:59,280 --> 02:11:01,549
because we never will be.

2111
02:11:01,712 --> 02:11:05,641
I will stop worrying
about being a boring old married couple...

2112
02:11:05,808 --> 02:11:08,197
because we never will be.

2113
02:11:08,752 --> 02:11:10,378
Are you sure?

2114
02:11:10,928 --> 02:11:13,349
It's gonna be just us two.

2115
02:11:14,671 --> 02:11:16,046
Are we enough?

2116
02:11:17,040 --> 02:11:18,665
Kid...

2117
02:11:19,184 --> 02:11:20,612
we're too much.

2118
02:11:25,551 --> 02:11:27,078
How's that for a little sparkle?

2119
02:11:28,559 --> 02:11:30,828
That's a lot of sparkle.

2120
02:11:33,616 --> 02:11:35,622
Why'd you get a black diamond?

2121
02:11:36,047 --> 02:11:38,380
Because you're not like anyone else.

2122
02:11:39,599 --> 02:11:40,973
That's a relief.

2123
02:11:41,135 --> 02:11:44,551
I thought you were gonna say
it's the color of my soul.

2124
02:11:49,327 --> 02:11:53,386
<i>And, like it always will,
time moved us on.</i>

2125
02:11:54,382 --> 02:11:55,365
<i>And in the future...</i>

2126
02:11:55,534 --> 02:11:58,601
I am proud to report
that the settlement we attained...

2127
02:11:58,766 --> 02:12:01,833
for Global Families Incorporated
surpassed their expectations.

2128
02:12:01,998 --> 02:12:06,537
<i>Miranda learned that at the right law firm,
where her voice was valued...</i>

2129
02:12:06,702 --> 02:12:09,769
<i>she was also fun at work.</i>

2130
02:12:11,565 --> 02:12:15,527
<i>And that July 4th,
on an East Hampton sand dune...</i>

2131
02:12:16,814 --> 02:12:20,775
<i>Samantha learned that good things
do come to those who wait...</i>

2132
02:12:20,942 --> 02:12:26,506
<i>when she and Rikard resumed
their date in the land of the free...</i>

2133
02:12:28,334 --> 02:12:30,243
<i>and the home of the hormones.</i>

2134
02:12:36,909 --> 02:12:40,869
<i>And Charlotte learned that she never
really had anything to worry about.</i>

2135
02:12:41,037 --> 02:12:46,339
<i>Turns out, her hot nanny preferred
the company of other hot nannies.</i>

2136
02:12:46,509 --> 02:12:48,515
- Stanford, here's a refresher.
- Yes, please.

2137
02:12:48,685 --> 02:12:51,750
- Happy birthday.
- What are you doing? You drank it all?

2138
02:12:51,917 --> 02:12:53,859
<i>And as Rose turned 3...</i>

2139
02:12:58,156 --> 02:13:01,636
<i>and our marriage grew out
of the terrible twos...</i>

2140
02:13:01,804 --> 02:13:06,505
<i>Big and I found less and less need
to escape to the other apartment.</i>

2141
02:13:10,092 --> 02:13:12,808
<i>But we kept the option open.</i>

2142
02:13:12,971 --> 02:13:16,266
<i>Just in case someone
needed those two days off.</i>

2143
02:13:31,595 --> 02:13:33,929
<i>As for me, I began to
think of marriage...</i>

2144
02:13:34,091 --> 02:13:37,702
<i>much like the Real Housewife
of Abu Dhabi's veil.</i>

2145
02:13:37,867 --> 02:13:42,885
<i>You have to take the tradition
and decorate it your way.</i>

2146
02:13:47,147 --> 02:13:48,870
<i>trying to make up my mind for me.</i>

2147
02:13:49,034 --> 02:13:51,303
<i>Well, stop it and do as I tell you.</i>

2148
02:13:52,426 --> 02:13:54,565
<i>- Leopold.
- Never take a stubborn woman...</i>

2149
02:13:54,731 --> 02:13:57,546
<i>...they're a curse. My mother
warned me against stubborn women.</i>

2150
02:13:57,707 --> 02:13:58,689
<i>Leopold.</i>

2151
02:13:58,859 --> 02:14:01,608
<i>Now, stop following me
or I'll call the police.</i>

2152
02:14:05,545 --> 02:14:09,407
<i>Because while movies may be
wonderful in black and white...</i>

2153
02:14:09,578 --> 02:14:11,618
<i>when it comes to relationships...</i>

2154
02:14:11,785 --> 02:14:15,910
<i>there's a whole range of colors
and options to explore.</i>

2155
02:14:16,074 --> 02:14:19,390
<i>And that's where I am today.</i>
