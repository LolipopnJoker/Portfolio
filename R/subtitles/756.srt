1
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:55,000
10,000 B.C

3
00:01:05,591 --> 00:01:10,562
Only time can teach us what
is truth and what is legend.

4
00:01:10,842 --> 00:01:14,502
Some truths do not survive the ages.

5
00:01:14,902 --> 00:01:20,283
But the legend of the child with
the blue eyes will live forever

6
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:23,924
and be whispered in all four
winds of the great white mountains.

7
00:01:23,974 --> 00:01:28,525
We, the Yagahl, were hunters
of the mightiest of all beasts,

8
00:01:28,895 --> 00:01:33,045
the manak. But our world began to change.

9
00:01:33,355 --> 00:01:36,836
The manaks came later
and later to our valley

10
00:01:36,886 --> 00:01:39,886
and there were times when
they did not come at all.

11
00:01:40,236 --> 00:01:42,297
Our hunters grew restless,

12
00:01:42,327 --> 00:01:44,827
and our people grew hungry.

13
00:01:48,788 --> 00:01:52,798
Only one amongst us, the
one we called Old Mother,

14
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:57,619
the last of her kind, only she could
speak to the spirits of the earth

15
00:01:57,699 --> 00:02:04,080
and ask the wisdom of the
Fathers to save our people.

16
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:10,291
Many times she asked.

17
00:02:10,391 --> 00:02:15,522
Until one night, they answered
her call and sent us a sign.

18
00:02:17,232 --> 00:02:19,933
A sign of the beginning of the end.

19
00:02:22,263 --> 00:02:26,964
We found her in the mountains.
She was holding onto a dead woman.

20
00:02:54,478 --> 00:02:56,638
The Fathers have sent her.

21
00:03:17,282 --> 00:03:19,052
She came to tell us

22
00:03:19,082 --> 00:03:24,823
of four-legged demons that
will put an end to our world.

23
00:03:27,443 --> 00:03:33,114
They will come to our
valley at the time when

24
00:03:33,694 --> 00:03:36,325
we go on our last hunt.

25
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,485
But do not fear.

26
00:03:41,775 --> 00:03:46,626
From this hunt, a warrior will arise.

27
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:50,447
And this one will be his woman.

28
00:03:50,827 --> 00:03:54,027
They will lead us into a new life

29
00:03:54,437 --> 00:03:59,748
where the Yagahl will
know hunger no more.

30
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:07,890
That night, Old Mother did not see
the face of the warrior which spoke,

31
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:11,980
but she knew that the
child with the blue eyes

32
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:16,001
was a blessing that she must protect.

33
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:20,872
To our people, she was Evolet,
the promise of life.

34
00:04:21,162 --> 00:04:26,723
To a boy named D'Leh,
she was much more than that.

35
00:04:39,294 --> 00:04:43,985
Only one of the Yagahl did not
believe in Old Mother's prophecy:

36
00:04:44,025 --> 00:04:45,926
The young boy's father,

37
00:04:46,316 --> 00:04:52,116
the one who carried the White Spear
and blew the whistle for the hunt.

38
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:56,477
I will watch over your
son as if he were my own.

39
00:04:58,157 --> 00:04:59,448
I know you will.

40
00:04:59,448 --> 00:05:03,248
But promise me you will
tell no one why I left.

41
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:11,219
We cannot wait for the last hunt.

42
00:05:24,121 --> 00:05:26,522
Throw again! Good throw!

43
00:05:26,862 --> 00:05:28,312
Ka'Ren.

44
00:05:28,952 --> 00:05:30,402
Ka'Ren.

45
00:05:31,563 --> 00:05:33,443
No, not you.

46
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:37,004
Your father abandoned our people.
Go away.

47
00:05:42,574 --> 00:05:46,315
Leave him!
Ka'Ren, I said, leave him!

48
00:05:49,505 --> 00:05:52,526
- D'Leh...
- He's the son of a coward.

49
00:05:52,536 --> 00:05:55,016
You never say that again.

50
00:05:55,936 --> 00:05:57,927
Any of you.

51
00:06:14,589 --> 00:06:17,740
You are alone. Like me.

52
00:06:22,601 --> 00:06:24,291
What happened to your people?

53
00:06:24,671 --> 00:06:26,931
They were killed.

54
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:29,842
By four-legged demons.

55
00:06:40,283 --> 00:06:43,184
You will never be alone, Evolet.

56
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:52,635
Do you see that light?
That one?

57
00:06:53,776 --> 00:06:56,816
It does not move across the
sky like all the others do.

58
00:06:58,686 --> 00:07:01,087
That light is like you, in my heart.

59
00:07:01,717 --> 00:07:03,577
It will never go away.

60
00:07:04,487 --> 00:07:05,917
It will never go away?

61
00:07:06,207 --> 00:07:07,798
No. Never.

62
00:07:11,588 --> 00:07:12,899
Evolet, come here.

63
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:16,079
Don't stray from the
hut without telling me.

64
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:25,501
And for many moons Evolet and
D'Leh looked at each other,

65
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:30,071
and the love in their
hearts grew stronger.

66
00:07:33,512 --> 00:07:36,512
10, 000 BC

67
00:07:37,622 --> 00:07:42,173
Until finally, after many years,

68
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:46,724
the day of the last hunt arrived.

69
00:07:47,864 --> 00:07:50,414
D'Leh, how long do we
have to keep watching?

70
00:07:50,664 --> 00:07:52,295
Until the manaks come.

71
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:57,115
- And when will they come?
- I don't know.

72
00:07:58,326 --> 00:08:02,206
- D'Leh, when will I become a hunter?
- When you stop asking so many questions.

73
00:08:08,857 --> 00:08:12,308
Great hunter Tic'Tic
came to Old Mother's hut today

74
00:08:12,678 --> 00:08:15,118
She thinks the time of prophecy has come.

75
00:08:15,158 --> 00:08:17,559
She told him not to
kill the manak this hunt.

76
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:20,899
She thinks Ka'Ren
will win the White Spear

77
00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:23,270
and claim Evolet.

78
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:29,140
Baku, look what I found for you.

79
00:08:31,571 --> 00:08:33,791
You know what a good hunter Ka'Ren is.

80
00:08:34,351 --> 00:08:35,391
We must run away.

81
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:37,942
Together we can cross
the Great Mountains.

82
00:08:37,972 --> 00:08:41,352
Abandon our people?
Like my father?

83
00:08:41,392 --> 00:08:44,103
I cannot do that.

84
00:08:46,073 --> 00:08:48,964
I've waited for this so many moons.

85
00:08:50,894 --> 00:08:53,154
The only way to be together is,

86
00:08:53,664 --> 00:08:56,155
I must kill the manak.

87
00:09:07,316 --> 00:09:09,457
They are here! They are here!
Look!

88
00:09:13,357 --> 00:09:15,798
Look how many they are!

89
00:09:43,872 --> 00:09:48,243
Today, I will not pierce
the heart of the manak.

90
00:09:48,523 --> 00:09:50,343
It will be one of you.

91
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:53,554
One of you will claim the White Spear.

92
00:09:54,524 --> 00:09:58,755
May the Fathers of the Yagahl
and the spirit of the mighty manak

93
00:09:58,755 --> 00:10:00,185
choose the best of you.

94
00:10:03,705 --> 00:10:07,066
- Ka'Ren, you have the first throw.
- Ka'Ren, the manak is yours.

95
00:10:07,096 --> 00:10:08,026
You will be our leader.

96
00:10:12,147 --> 00:10:14,007
D'Leh, what about you?

97
00:10:15,507 --> 00:10:18,388
I want to win Evolet.

98
00:10:20,898 --> 00:10:23,938
All together, at once!

99
00:10:56,204 --> 00:10:59,294
Tic'Tic found the lead bull.

100
00:11:50,932 --> 00:11:54,313
Slow down! D'Leh!

101
00:12:00,694 --> 00:12:04,104
They're breaking away!
Hold him back!

102
00:12:26,508 --> 00:12:31,378
Baku, they are coming!
They are coming! Baku

103
00:12:31,588 --> 00:12:33,749
They are coming! They are coming!

104
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,669
They are...

105
00:12:47,421 --> 00:12:50,691
The last one is coming!
It is a big bull!

106
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:18,256
D'Leh is coming!
Ka'Ren, make your throw!

107
00:13:26,757 --> 00:13:29,558
Keep him low!
Hold him back!

108
00:13:41,549 --> 00:13:43,890
He's too strong.
Let go, Ka'Ren.

109
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:49,101
- D'Leh, we have to let go.
- I can't. My hand is caught.

110
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:21,555
Look, look!
It's D'Leh!

111
00:15:29,186 --> 00:15:31,377
You killed him!
All alone!

112
00:15:31,417 --> 00:15:33,567
No one has ever done that.

113
00:15:35,337 --> 00:15:38,178
That was brave.

114
00:15:41,188 --> 00:15:44,229
D'Leh killed the manak.
He did not let go of the net.

115
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:45,719
He was the only one.

116
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,470
What are you waiting for?

117
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,490
Wise Spirit, I killed the manak.

118
00:15:55,530 --> 00:16:03,912
I claim the White Spear.
And with it my woman Evolet

119
00:16:13,563 --> 00:16:17,814
From that day on,
D'Leh was no longer the son of a coward.

120
00:16:19,074 --> 00:16:21,404
Now the Yagahl would honor his name

121
00:16:21,905 --> 00:16:27,705
for bringing to them the blessings
of the manak for one last time.

122
00:16:28,476 --> 00:16:32,296
And though Old Mother
was pleased in her heart

123
00:16:33,116 --> 00:16:35,347
to see Evolet so happy,

124
00:16:35,377 --> 00:16:39,897
she feared in her soul that the
one who had slain the mighty beast

125
00:16:39,927 --> 00:16:44,558
did not have the courage
for what was to come.

126
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:58,410
Why does Tic'Tic not celebrate with us?

127
00:17:03,681 --> 00:17:06,021
- D'Leh?
- There's something I must do.

128
00:17:22,134 --> 00:17:23,814
What do you want?

129
00:17:29,475 --> 00:17:33,026
I was not brave.
And I did not hunt as one.

130
00:17:34,986 --> 00:17:38,417
The Fathers of the Yagahl
played with us today.

131
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:43,057
What should I do? If I give up the White Spear,
I give up Evolet. I will no do that

132
00:17:43,907 --> 00:17:46,048
Is she yours to give up?

133
00:17:49,078 --> 00:17:54,009
It is not the way of the Yagahl to
claim the White Spear with a lie.

134
00:18:15,372 --> 00:18:19,853
- I gave the White Spear back to Tic'Tic.
- Why would you do such a thing?

135
00:18:20,193 --> 00:18:24,814
- I did not kill the manak, Evolet.
- Yes you did. You held on to the net.

136
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,154
No, I lied!

137
00:18:29,385 --> 00:18:35,025
I tried to let go with all the others.
My hand was caught in it.

138
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:38,116
Then the manak ran into my spear.

139
00:18:39,656 --> 00:18:41,656
I did nothing!

140
00:18:45,547 --> 00:18:49,458
Evolet, remember what I
told you about our light?

141
00:18:51,288 --> 00:18:53,968
I still feel the same.

142
00:18:54,899 --> 00:18:57,759
You will always be in my heart.

143
00:18:58,219 --> 00:19:00,339
That will never go away.

144
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,070
But still...

145
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,121
you're giving me up.

146
00:19:22,883 --> 00:19:28,304
That night the great white rain
came to the valley of the Yagahl.

147
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:33,084
And like an icy rain, sadness
fell over D'Leh's heart.

148
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:41,446
And with the white rain
came the four-legged demons.

149
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:02,239
Stay here.

150
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:47,766
Moha!
Watch out!

151
00:20:53,767 --> 00:20:54,767
<i>(Do not kill them)</i>

152
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:56,768
<i>(capture¡­)</i>

153
00:21:07,719 --> 00:21:09,520
- Baku, hide you!
- Yes mother.

154
00:21:42,295 --> 00:21:43,925
We cannot help them.

155
00:22:00,228 --> 00:22:02,328
<i>(Tie her to my horse)</i>

156
00:22:07,719 --> 00:22:08,329
Let me...

157
00:22:10,449 --> 00:22:12,019
Let me go!

158
00:22:50,385 --> 00:22:52,356
- What are you doing?
- I'm going after them.

159
00:22:52,386 --> 00:22:55,726
Over the Great Mountains?
That is not possible.

160
00:22:56,026 --> 00:22:57,777
They came over the Great Mountains,
did they not?

161
00:22:57,817 --> 00:23:01,577
- They are demons. Maybe they can fly.
- I did not see wings on them, did you?

162
00:23:01,677 --> 00:23:04,508
You think you can bring a God down alone?
Who are you?

163
00:23:04,738 --> 00:23:05,368
He is not alone.

164
00:23:06,038 --> 00:23:09,308
I go with him.

165
00:23:09,678 --> 00:23:12,269
Without the other hunters,
we all will die.

166
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:14,099
I will go too.

167
00:23:14,209 --> 00:23:17,420
No, Baku, you will stay here.

168
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:20,310
But you, Ka'Ren, you must go with him.

169
00:23:31,682 --> 00:23:33,632
Don't touch me!

170
00:23:48,524 --> 00:23:52,775
And as they bade farewell to the
elders and the children of our people,

171
00:23:53,385 --> 00:23:55,876
the Wise Spirit of the Yagahl

172
00:23:56,266 --> 00:23:58,926
blessed them and the
spears by their sides.

173
00:23:58,996 --> 00:24:03,397
Old Mother knew they would
never be hunters again

174
00:24:03,427 --> 00:24:06,397
but warriors since then.

175
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:23,980
It will be night, so we stay here.

176
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,700
No, we go on. We are getting closer.

177
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:29,521
I cannot see in the dark, can you?
We stay here.

178
00:24:29,581 --> 00:24:32,191
We eat and sleep.

179
00:24:40,223 --> 00:24:42,693
Why do you not carry the White Spear?

180
00:24:47,424 --> 00:24:48,804
Are you afraid?

181
00:24:49,734 --> 00:24:50,694
Answer!

182
00:24:51,294 --> 00:24:52,995
Ka'Ren, go to sleep.

183
00:25:06,857 --> 00:25:11,257
Baku? Baku!
What are you doing here?

184
00:25:11,337 --> 00:25:13,208
- Go home!
- I can help you.

185
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:16,088
- I can carry the water bag.
- Go home!

186
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,969
They killed my mother!

187
00:25:20,189 --> 00:25:20,879
He's alone.

188
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:26,230
He will only slow us down.

189
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,620
D'Leh, I'm thirsty.

190
00:25:56,234 --> 00:25:59,665
- The fire still lives in these stones.
- D'Leh!

191
00:26:04,256 --> 00:26:07,326
She is alive.
We must hurry!

192
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,570
Why is Old Mother freezing?

193
00:26:48,263 --> 00:26:51,083
White rain is not a friend of the hunter.

194
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:55,264
It swallowed all the marks of
the stolen brothers and sisters.

195
00:26:57,814 --> 00:27:03,575
It was now to the Fathers of
the Yagahl to guide their way.

196
00:27:07,596 --> 00:27:11,446
And they walked for many days
and night to a faraway land

197
00:27:11,986 --> 00:27:13,277
where the Great Mountains ended

198
00:27:13,407 --> 00:27:18,377
and where the story of the
child with the blue eyes began.

199
00:27:19,498 --> 00:27:25,238
The place where the four-legged
demons killed Evolet's people.

200
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,040
We've walked for days now.
And still no marks!

201
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:38,911
- Maybe they do have wings.
- Maybe they do.

202
00:27:39,211 --> 00:27:41,991
But our brothers and sisters do not.

203
00:27:53,383 --> 00:27:55,553
Don't forget to chew.

204
00:28:08,255 --> 00:28:09,255
£¨This witch leaves marks)</i>

205
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:12,756
<i>(She is bad luck)</i>

206
00:28:25,958 --> 00:28:26,458
<i>(take it off)</i>

207
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,060
<i>(I like your spirit)</i>

208
00:28:42,761 --> 00:28:43,961
<i>(¡­but I will have to break it)</i>

209
00:29:03,634 --> 00:29:05,264
Maybe she only lost it.

210
00:29:22,947 --> 00:29:27,968
- It is hot here.
- Baku, stay close.

211
00:30:14,175 --> 00:30:16,365
What was that?

212
00:31:06,403 --> 00:31:08,693
- We must free them tonight.
- Not tonight.

213
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:10,024
This is not a good place.

214
00:31:11,834 --> 00:31:14,264
They know there is danger out there,
and they keep a good watch.

215
00:31:14,304 --> 00:31:15,815
We do the same.

216
00:31:15,885 --> 00:31:18,715
I will go first,
then Ka'Ren, then you.

217
00:31:19,625 --> 00:31:22,376
D'Leh! Come!

218
00:31:41,529 --> 00:31:43,859
I understand your pain.

219
00:31:44,149 --> 00:31:46,709
But you must be patient.

220
00:32:46,169 --> 00:32:47,019
D'Leh!

221
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:52,960
I will never give you up again.

222
00:32:58,781 --> 00:32:59,641
This way!

223
00:33:01,331 --> 00:33:02,081
Go!

224
00:33:34,126 --> 00:33:34,656
D'Leh!

225
00:33:36,227 --> 00:33:37,317
Run!

226
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,510
Over here! This way!

227
00:34:07,631 --> 00:34:08,832
Ka'Ren!

228
00:34:47,848 --> 00:34:49,058
Run! Run!

229
00:34:51,108 --> 00:34:52,939
Tic'Tic! Go!
Tic'Tic!

230
00:35:27,384 --> 00:35:29,124
D'Leh, Evolet, up here!

231
00:35:48,497 --> 00:35:51,068
- D'Leh!
- L'll get the boy!

232
00:35:51,108 --> 00:35:53,958
- No, do not go!
- I will come back for you. I promise.

233
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,991
Baku!

234
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:17,701
You should not be here.

235
00:37:37,904 --> 00:37:38,505
<i>(Who is he?)</i>

236
00:37:38,815 --> 00:37:40,375
I think he speaks of D'Leh.

237
00:37:41,775 --> 00:37:42,675
<i>(Try that again)</i>

238
00:37:44,275 --> 00:37:46,076
<i>(¡­and I will kill you both)</i>

239
00:37:49,576 --> 00:37:50,376
<i>(Never¡­)</i>

240
00:37:51,377 --> 00:37:53,177
<i>(¡­never run away from me again)</i>

241
00:38:00,498 --> 00:38:04,529
D'Leh will come back.
He promised it to me.

242
00:38:44,265 --> 00:38:48,165
- Ka'Ren, do you think he's still alive?
- Does not matter now.

243
00:38:48,255 --> 00:38:49,696
He tried to save us!

244
00:39:41,304 --> 00:39:43,544
Forgive me, Tic'Tic.
I should have listened to you.

245
00:39:44,274 --> 00:39:47,365
Tonight, l'll bring you food.

246
00:40:28,021 --> 00:40:32,732
Old Mother was watching over
their journey with all her strength

247
00:40:33,172 --> 00:40:36,102
and her spirit stayed
always by their side.

248
00:40:40,383 --> 00:40:44,454
But that night she could not
rule over the forces of the earth

249
00:40:45,494 --> 00:40:47,844
and could not stop the
waters of the heavens.

250
00:40:50,725 --> 00:40:55,365
D'Leh would have to face alone the
mighty beast who rules these lands.

251
00:42:02,236 --> 00:42:04,106
Do not eat me when I set you free!

252
00:43:05,156 --> 00:43:08,076
- I feared you were dead.
- Do not fear for me.

253
00:43:08,696 --> 00:43:10,607
Look, over there.

254
00:43:10,647 --> 00:43:14,327
There was an attack.
I heard them screaming.

255
00:43:15,077 --> 00:43:18,058
This is where they went.

256
00:44:29,729 --> 00:44:32,139
Tic'Tic, move away.
Come!

257
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,220
D'Leh, come back.

258
00:44:43,501 --> 00:44:44,891
Move away!

259
00:44:56,413 --> 00:45:00,034
You must remember me. I gave you life.

260
00:45:43,881 --> 00:45:45,351
Speak to the Spear Tooth?

261
00:45:49,611 --> 00:45:51,322
How do you come to speak our words?

262
00:46:20,946 --> 00:46:23,047
Do not like Naku food?

263
00:46:25,057 --> 00:46:26,447
It's different, but good.

264
00:46:36,259 --> 00:46:39,139
- We come from over the mountains.
- We know where you come from.

265
00:46:39,179 --> 00:46:42,280
How do you know?
How do you come to speak our words?

266
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:44,250
A man come from the mountain before.

267
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:48,821
He was looking for a new land.
Our wise man told me to learn his words.

268
00:46:49,101 --> 00:46:51,381
You, you have his face.

269
00:47:02,393 --> 00:47:03,603
What happened to him?

270
00:47:04,683 --> 00:47:06,313
He was taken a long time ago.

271
00:47:07,204 --> 00:47:08,484
Taken where?

272
00:47:10,694 --> 00:47:12,054
Come.

273
00:47:12,744 --> 00:47:15,505
When your father came to us,
he became my friend.

274
00:47:16,585 --> 00:47:19,576
Then the evil spirits stole your father,

275
00:47:19,966 --> 00:47:21,436
like many of our people.

276
00:47:22,366 --> 00:47:24,496
They bring them to the
nest of the great birds

277
00:47:25,736 --> 00:47:27,487
and fly away over the sand.

278
00:47:29,267 --> 00:47:30,587
Where do they take them?

279
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:34,188
To the Mountain of the Gods.

280
00:47:35,628 --> 00:47:37,988
No one has ever returned.

281
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:43,109
Our wise man says you will lead us there.

282
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,450
Me?

283
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:50,130
We have a telling that

284
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:52,801
one day the one will come

285
00:47:54,661 --> 00:47:56,561
who will free our people.

286
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:03,542
The one who speaks to the Spear Tooth.

287
00:48:06,683 --> 00:48:10,504
And as the brave people of
the Naku buried their dead,

288
00:48:11,064 --> 00:48:14,044
they sent word to all
the tribes of the land

289
00:48:14,284 --> 00:48:17,895
that the one who speaks
to Spear Tooth had come.

290
00:48:20,435 --> 00:48:23,125
Their call was a call for war.

291
00:48:26,926 --> 00:48:28,556
Why do they think I
can free their people?

292
00:48:35,417 --> 00:48:37,358
There's something you must
know about your father.

293
00:48:40,268 --> 00:48:43,549
When your mother died bringing you life,

294
00:48:46,429 --> 00:48:50,140
your father took upon himself
not only the weight of you,

295
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:52,320
but all our people.

296
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:54,190
We were starving.

297
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:57,251
He could not wait for Old
Mother's prophecy to come true.

298
00:49:00,431 --> 00:49:02,022
Your father did not run away.

299
00:49:03,532 --> 00:49:05,432
He left to save our people.

300
00:49:05,742 --> 00:49:08,223
How could you let me
believe all this time

301
00:49:08,483 --> 00:49:09,933
that my father betrayed us?

302
00:49:10,083 --> 00:49:12,373
Because he wanted you to be that way.

303
00:49:13,653 --> 00:49:15,934
Your father carried the White Spear.

304
00:49:16,794 --> 00:49:19,044
He feared that when he left,
others would follow him

305
00:49:19,854 --> 00:49:22,065
and abandon our people.

306
00:49:23,165 --> 00:49:25,945
And why do you tell me this now?

307
00:49:28,196 --> 00:49:29,646
A good man...

308
00:49:31,336 --> 00:49:34,887
draws a circle around himself
and cares for those within.

309
00:49:36,317 --> 00:49:37,617
His woman, his children.

310
00:49:38,897 --> 00:49:43,198
Other men draw a larger circle and
bring within their brothers and sisters.

311
00:49:44,478 --> 00:49:46,609
Some men

312
00:49:46,839 --> 00:49:48,429
have a great destiny.

313
00:49:49,909 --> 00:49:51,569
They must draw around themselves

314
00:49:51,999 --> 00:49:55,210
a circle that encloses many, many more.

315
00:49:57,230 --> 00:50:00,841
Your father... was one of those men.

316
00:50:04,951 --> 00:50:06,622
You must decide for yourself

317
00:50:07,392 --> 00:50:10,362
whether you are as well.

318
00:50:24,985 --> 00:50:26,725
This is Kawu, our fastest runner.

319
00:50:30,325 --> 00:50:32,276
He bring voice from the
people who live that way.

320
00:50:33,046 --> 00:50:34,646
They stole many more men.

321
00:50:34,646 --> 00:50:37,797
And now they are moving
to the great birds, fast.

322
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:40,527
We must find them before
they reach these birds.

323
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,830
You have no woman?

324
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:02,150
The day before you came,

325
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:04,931
they took her life.

326
00:51:07,371 --> 00:51:08,541
And they stole our son.

327
00:51:27,254 --> 00:51:28,214
I am Baku.

328
00:51:30,195 --> 00:51:34,335
- Tudu.
- No, I am Baku.

329
00:51:35,786 --> 00:51:39,096
Baku, Tudu.
Baku, Tudu.

330
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:05,420
He's killing him! You must help!

331
00:52:10,121 --> 00:52:11,121
<i>(Let him go!)</i>

332
00:52:13,222 --> 00:52:14,122
<i>(To please your witch¡­)</i>

333
00:52:14,832 --> 00:52:15,832
<i>(¡­you hit me?)</i>

334
00:52:19,032 --> 00:52:19,933
<i>(Just try it¡­)</i>

335
00:52:25,333 --> 00:52:27,034
<i>(You will regret that)</i>

336
00:52:34,835 --> 00:52:40,516
The word of the Naku traveled fast
and from all winds came many warriors.

337
00:52:41,056 --> 00:52:46,207
The TukTuk, who move like big running
birds and hide their eyes behind trees.

338
00:52:46,507 --> 00:52:50,377
The child of Kala,
they are short as our young boys

339
00:52:50,517 --> 00:52:55,168
And from the valley without sun came
the ones with blood on their heads.

340
00:52:56,108 --> 00:52:59,319
But the strongest of
them all were the Huta.

341
00:53:00,949 --> 00:53:04,520
Their leader spoke for all
the warriors of the land.

342
00:53:15,051 --> 00:53:19,962
Tell him if his people walk with us,
we will bring them down.

343
00:53:27,483 --> 00:53:29,894
He says you are only a boy.

344
00:53:32,854 --> 00:53:35,624
Tell him I am older than I look.

345
00:53:38,425 --> 00:53:41,245
Quina is a Hoda. Hoda do not laugh.

346
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:17,151
They walked faster and faster and
did not slow down to eat or to rest.

347
00:54:18,251 --> 00:54:21,132
And more spears joined
them with each passing day.

348
00:54:25,632 --> 00:54:27,133
<i>(To the river¡­fast!)</i>

349
00:54:29,863 --> 00:54:32,283
This word "yahala", what does it mean?

350
00:54:32,313 --> 00:54:35,884
They are your words:
"We must bring them down."

351
00:54:53,137 --> 00:54:54,567
The great birds have arrived.

352
00:55:11,299 --> 00:55:12,060
Evolet!

353
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,430
Evolet!

354
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,821
Baku, D'Leh's here!

355
00:55:59,037 --> 00:56:01,847
Tudu, that man with the spear,
he will not give up.

356
00:56:01,947 --> 00:56:03,488
Him and her.

357
00:56:06,618 --> 00:56:08,118
Maybe the boy is right.

358
00:56:08,518 --> 00:56:10,919
D'Leh cannot fly over
the water like they can.

359
00:56:11,649 --> 00:56:13,359
But who the fuck could
fight so many spears?

360
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:21,460
This river moves like a snake in the sun.

361
00:56:23,021 --> 00:56:26,591
He says the eye of the
snake rest under the sun

362
00:56:26,881 --> 00:56:30,722
and under the moon does not move.

363
00:56:30,752 --> 00:56:33,172
Is there a shorter way
to the head of the snake?

364
00:56:37,523 --> 00:56:41,163
We must look beyond the Great Sand.
But no one can walk that far.

365
00:56:41,584 --> 00:56:45,664
The mountains and the sand,
they all look the same.

366
00:56:46,414 --> 00:56:48,615
And we will lose our way.

367
00:56:49,315 --> 00:56:51,515
We will all die.

368
00:56:55,116 --> 00:56:58,016
We will find the head of the snake.

369
00:56:58,986 --> 00:57:01,177
And we will free our people!

370
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:23,870
We must rest.

371
00:57:26,111 --> 00:57:28,921
The man from the river
had spoken the truth.

372
00:57:30,001 --> 00:57:33,882
They had walked in circles for
many days and lost their way.

373
00:57:35,332 --> 00:57:39,133
And the eye of the snake
was nowhere to be found.

374
00:57:50,434 --> 00:57:51,435
<i>(You must forget¡­)</i>

375
00:57:51,935 --> 00:57:54,235
<i>(¡­the man that follows you)</i>

376
00:57:55,145 --> 00:57:55,845
<i>(No one has ever¡­)</i>

377
00:57:55,845 --> 00:57:56,845
<i>(¡­crossed the sea of sand)</i>

378
00:57:59,246 --> 00:58:00,546
<i>(They will all die.)</i>

379
00:58:34,581 --> 00:58:37,812
Tic'Tic, Tic'Tic...
I found the eye of the snake!

380
00:58:38,232 --> 00:58:40,192
You see that light? That one?

381
00:58:40,222 --> 00:58:42,623
Remember what the river people said?

382
00:58:42,653 --> 00:58:45,643
It rests under the sun,
but under the moon it does not move.

383
00:58:47,213 --> 00:58:48,743
Nakudu, tell them what I said.

384
00:58:49,534 --> 00:58:50,934
It will guide us to
the head of the snake.

385
00:59:09,267 --> 00:59:12,597
And as the last moon had come
to the valley of the Yagahl,

386
00:59:12,637 --> 00:59:16,188
it seemed that all spirits
had left Old Mother.

387
00:59:17,008 --> 00:59:20,398
She did not eat or speak for many moons

388
00:59:21,149 --> 00:59:25,679
because she knew there was
one last destiny to fulfill.

389
00:59:25,949 --> 00:59:27,230
Wise Spirit...

390
00:59:28,810 --> 00:59:29,790
It's me, Katan.

391
01:00:10,876 --> 01:00:12,467
The mountains of the gods

392
01:00:14,217 --> 01:00:15,367
and the head of the snake.

393
01:01:31,709 --> 01:01:33,919
- Evolet, you are well?
- Ssh, don't speak.

394
01:01:47,031 --> 01:01:48,112
Baku, over here!

395
01:01:53,492 --> 01:01:56,383
How can a man do such a
thing to a father manak?

396
01:01:57,263 --> 01:01:58,643
They are not men like us, Baku.

397
01:01:58,863 --> 01:02:00,794
Then what are they?

398
01:02:00,804 --> 01:02:02,704
Some say they came from the stars.

399
01:02:03,314 --> 01:02:06,544
Others believe that they
flew across the Great Water

400
01:02:06,574 --> 01:02:07,795
when their land sank into the sea.

401
01:02:35,799 --> 01:02:37,399
<i>(They must work faster!)</i>

402
01:02:37,799 --> 01:02:39,500
<i>(What should I do, Almighty?)</i>

403
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:41,200
<i>(Sacrifice one.)</i>

404
01:02:46,011 --> 01:02:48,211
<i>(The Almighty is not pleased¡­)</i>

405
01:02:48,911 --> 01:02:50,711
<i>(Bring him an offering)</i>

406
01:03:24,617 --> 01:03:26,617
They are too many to free for every one of us.

407
01:03:28,017 --> 01:03:29,117
No one can bring them down.

408
01:03:31,318 --> 01:03:31,818
No, D'Leh

409
01:03:34,598 --> 01:03:37,699
The ones they force to do their work,

410
01:03:37,809 --> 01:03:38,859
They are even more.

411
01:03:40,569 --> 01:03:42,319
You think they will fight with us?

412
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,470
That is for you to find out.

413
01:04:12,884 --> 01:04:15,085
<i>(Keep this to yourself.)</i>

414
01:04:40,619 --> 01:04:43,479
D'Leh! D'Leh!

415
01:04:46,129 --> 01:04:48,290
Do not be afraid, Baku.
L'll bring you home.

416
01:04:50,330 --> 01:04:53,411
- Where is Evolet?
- The women sleep in different huts.

417
01:04:53,951 --> 01:04:55,011
But I saw her today.

418
01:04:59,372 --> 01:05:01,392
Tic'Tic is waiting with
many spears by the sand.

419
01:05:03,432 --> 01:05:07,723
They killed Moha today.
He was sacrificed.

420
01:05:07,753 --> 01:05:11,253
It is my mistake that they
are in this terrible mess.

421
01:05:11,613 --> 01:05:13,204
I need your forgiveness.

422
01:05:14,244 --> 01:05:16,904
The Fathers chose you to lead us.

423
01:05:17,834 --> 01:05:20,335
And we will stand by your side.

424
01:05:27,556 --> 01:05:29,246
Tell them how many spears we have.

425
01:05:37,207 --> 01:05:40,708
The number of spears does not matter.
Men cannot bring down Gods.

426
01:05:43,408 --> 01:05:44,109
<i>(He has magical powers.)</i>

427
01:05:45,109 --> 01:05:46,909
<i>(He speaks to the Spear Tooth)</i>

428
01:06:06,492 --> 01:06:08,942
He says the blind man
knows much about the Gods.

429
01:06:10,103 --> 01:06:12,463
He was once their servant, but ran away.

430
01:06:12,653 --> 01:06:14,553
They have hidden him here ever since.

431
01:06:14,893 --> 01:06:16,394
Wise man...

432
01:06:18,234 --> 01:06:20,434
Tell us more of these Gods.

433
01:06:30,076 --> 01:06:33,336
They were three,
but now there's only one left.

434
01:06:33,366 --> 01:06:35,477
There must be a way to defeat him.

435
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:42,938
He said, once,
only once he heard the God

436
01:06:43,358 --> 01:06:45,818
speak of one he fears.

437
01:06:45,848 --> 01:06:49,499
They have a telling of
one who wears the mark

438
01:06:49,529 --> 01:06:52,559
that you can see in the sky at night.

439
01:06:52,589 --> 01:06:56,230
They call it Uruana,
"the Mark of the Hunter".

440
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:01,521
The brightest star of all heaven.

441
01:07:07,382 --> 01:07:10,302
He asks if you wear
the Mark of the Hunter.

442
01:07:20,154 --> 01:07:22,624
Without the mark,
you cannot bring down the God.

443
01:07:35,156 --> 01:07:37,316
Wait, wait. The band on your arm.

444
01:07:38,526 --> 01:07:42,207
Where did you get it?

445
01:07:42,237 --> 01:07:45,978
- The man who saved his life.
- Where is he?

446
01:07:47,818 --> 01:07:50,648
His bones are buried in the
sand with all the others.

447
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:55,019
He wants to know why you ask of this man.

448
01:07:56,099 --> 01:07:57,289
He was my father.

449
01:08:26,704 --> 01:08:28,484
Ask him where Tic'Tic is.

450
01:08:31,555 --> 01:08:33,085
They got on us!

451
01:09:35,805 --> 01:09:38,255
I am full of days.

452
01:09:38,885 --> 01:09:40,256
Please, great hunter, do not say that.

453
01:09:40,696 --> 01:09:41,606
We need you.

454
01:09:44,636 --> 01:09:46,046
They will not fight with us.

455
01:09:47,737 --> 01:09:49,727
They have their own prophecy.

456
01:09:50,637 --> 01:09:51,437
D'Leh

457
01:09:53,768 --> 01:09:58,078
A prophecy has many faces,
many ways to come true.

458
01:10:00,009 --> 01:10:04,049
Your father, he gave this to me.

459
01:10:04,669 --> 01:10:06,850
- No, great hunter, this is yours...
- Take it.

460
01:10:12,231 --> 01:10:13,041
Be as your father.

461
01:10:15,821 --> 01:10:16,661
Be as your father.

462
01:11:03,569 --> 01:11:04,869
<i>(Come to me.)</i>

463
01:11:06,569 --> 01:11:09,169
<i>(I set you free.)</i>

464
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:12,470
<i>(¡­now I will make you mine.)</i>

465
01:11:34,583 --> 01:11:35,784
<i>(You stole a slave from the Almighty.)</i>

466
01:11:36,284 --> 01:11:37,084
<i>(I own her.)</i>

467
01:11:37,284 --> 01:11:38,984
<i>(That is not for you to say.)</i>

468
01:12:01,388 --> 01:12:03,088
<i>(Give it to me.)</i>

469
01:12:03,788 --> 01:12:05,088
<i>(Give us the knife.)</i>

470
01:12:13,990 --> 01:12:15,090
<i>(Look at her scars¡­)</i>

471
01:12:15,790 --> 01:12:16,790
<i>(¡­they form¡­)</i>

472
01:12:18,390 --> 01:12:19,991
<i>(¡­the Mark!)</i>

473
01:12:34,293 --> 01:12:36,093
<i>(We found the Mark!)</i>

474
01:12:36,193 --> 01:12:36,993
<i>(Where is it?)</i>

475
01:12:38,603 --> 01:12:40,004
<i>(On a slave's hand!)</i>

476
01:13:55,115 --> 01:13:57,016
<i>(Almighty, I do not dare¡­)</i>

477
01:13:57,216 --> 01:13:58,916
<i>(¡­tell you what we found)</i>

478
01:13:59,616 --> 01:14:01,516
<i>(Speak to me!)</i>

479
01:14:02,617 --> 01:14:04,117
<i>(The Mark¡­)</i>

480
01:14:04,117 --> 01:14:05,117
<i>(¡­of the Hunter!)</i>

481
01:14:06,917 --> 01:14:08,718
<i>(That can not be!)</i>

482
01:14:12,918 --> 01:14:13,618
D'Leh

483
01:14:15,109 --> 01:14:17,779
I know how it feels
to lose a good friend.

484
01:14:20,199 --> 01:14:22,700
Your father was mine.

485
01:14:23,470 --> 01:14:25,550
I barely remember him.

486
01:14:25,890 --> 01:14:28,011
He remembered you.

487
01:14:29,691 --> 01:14:34,762
His heart hurt when he spoke about
a boy beyond the Great Mountains.

488
01:14:35,042 --> 01:14:38,062
He was preparing to
leave to go back to you.

489
01:14:38,572 --> 01:14:41,773
That is when he was taken.

490
01:14:47,174 --> 01:14:49,044
D'Leh,

491
01:14:49,074 --> 01:14:50,904
the men are waiting.

492
01:15:48,353 --> 01:15:51,854
We, the people of the Yagahl,

493
01:15:54,274 --> 01:15:56,234
hunt the mightiest of beasts, the manak.

494
01:15:59,265 --> 01:16:03,426
He is great and we are small,
and still we bring him down.

495
01:16:08,546 --> 01:16:12,197
Because we hunt together. As one.

496
01:16:14,587 --> 01:16:16,708
When the sun arises,

497
01:16:17,608 --> 01:16:21,018
we will join our brothers and
sisters on the Mountain of the God

498
01:16:22,128 --> 01:16:24,759
and convince them to fight with us

499
01:16:25,559 --> 01:16:26,599
together, as one!

500
01:16:55,984 --> 01:16:57,244
What just happened?

501
01:16:58,894 --> 01:17:02,755
Listen, Baku, today you
must become a hunter.

502
01:17:02,795 --> 01:17:03,805
Me?

503
01:17:09,916 --> 01:17:11,886
"Yahala."

504
01:17:16,197 --> 01:17:17,997
<i>(Please take it back, Almighty.)</i>

505
01:17:18,397 --> 01:17:19,798
<i>(Slience, traitor.)</i>

506
01:17:24,898 --> 01:17:26,999
<i>(How can scars be the Mark?)</i>

507
01:17:28,199 --> 01:17:29,399
<i>(Did you measure them?)</i>

508
01:17:29,399 --> 01:17:30,599
<i>(Very carefully, Almighty¡­)</i>

509
01:17:30,999 --> 01:17:32,099
<i>(¡­many times!)</i>

510
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:34,400
<i>(What else does the horseman know?)</i>

511
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:36,600
<i>(A man from the mountains¡­£©

512
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:39,001
<i>(¡­follows her with many warriors.)</i>

513
01:17:40,211 --> 01:17:41,911
<i>(Then the Hunter has arrived!)</i>

514
01:17:59,414 --> 01:18:00,314
Look, Ka'Ren.

515
01:18:00,484 --> 01:18:02,214
Look. That one.

516
01:18:03,594 --> 01:18:06,425
Baku, we found the real bull. Go.

517
01:18:10,125 --> 01:18:10,926
Now!

518
01:18:32,329 --> 01:18:33,629
Quina, not yet

519
01:18:38,730 --> 01:18:39,730
Now!

520
01:19:06,734 --> 01:19:10,235
- They will not charge.
- It can't paid D'Leh too long.

521
01:19:12,055 --> 01:19:13,685
Ka'Ren, look!

522
01:19:16,006 --> 01:19:19,396
We must go everybody up the ramp!
Go, go!

523
01:19:19,396 --> 01:19:19,996
Move!

524
01:19:22,797 --> 01:19:24,127
Ka'Ren! No!

525
01:20:56,641 --> 01:20:57,342
<i>(The slaves are coming!)</i>

526
01:20:58,842 --> 01:21:00,142
<i>(Down on your knees)</i>

527
01:21:01,242 --> 01:21:02,842
<i>(She will stop them¡­)</i>

528
01:21:04,443 --> 01:21:05,543
<i>(Take her outside¡­)</i>

529
01:21:05,553 --> 01:21:07,253
<i>(¡­and rip her apart.)</i>

530
01:22:03,792 --> 01:22:05,102
Stop!

531
01:22:05,902 --> 01:22:06,702
Stop!

532
01:22:48,469 --> 01:22:51,660
He says the one who follows
this woman should turn back,

533
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:53,870
or she will die.

534
01:22:59,241 --> 01:23:00,671
Like this traitor.

535
01:23:04,201 --> 01:23:08,782
Turn back to your mountains.
You can take your woman.

536
01:23:17,284 --> 01:23:20,404
Tell him l'll take his offer.

537
01:23:23,575 --> 01:23:26,645
Tell him I accept.

538
01:23:28,275 --> 01:23:30,086
Tell him!

539
01:23:35,086 --> 01:23:38,287
But I will take all my people with me.

540
01:23:39,637 --> 01:23:43,448
Each and every Yagahl.

541
01:23:45,958 --> 01:23:46,978
Tell him!

542
01:24:02,971 --> 01:24:04,661
They are yours!

543
01:24:06,641 --> 01:24:08,642
Ask him what will happen to the others!

544
01:24:26,754 --> 01:24:28,505
They belong to the God, he says.

545
01:24:28,825 --> 01:24:31,585
They will do his work. Forever.

546
01:24:36,766 --> 01:24:38,386
No...

547
01:24:39,986 --> 01:24:42,637
They will not!

548
01:25:06,411 --> 01:25:08,771
He is not a God!

549
01:25:37,085 --> 01:25:39,896
D'Leh!

550
01:25:45,697 --> 01:25:47,097
Evolet!

551
01:26:02,839 --> 01:26:03,790
No!

552
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:12,820
Nooo!

553
01:27:34,084 --> 01:27:36,484
Help! Help!
She is bleeding!

554
01:27:49,386 --> 01:27:51,787
<i>(You will not have her either.)</i>

555
01:28:22,921 --> 01:28:24,562
You came for me.

556
01:28:30,963 --> 01:28:32,763
No¡­no, please.

557
01:28:34,663 --> 01:28:36,063
You came for me.

558
01:28:38,424 --> 01:28:41,414
Please, no. Please.

559
01:29:41,214 --> 01:29:43,144
To have journeyed so far,

560
01:29:43,254 --> 01:29:46,264
to have walked till the end of the world

561
01:29:46,274 --> 01:29:48,965
to bring down the one
they call the Almighty

562
01:29:49,495 --> 01:29:53,236
only to return without Evolet,

563
01:29:53,736 --> 01:29:56,996
this was not what Old
Mother had foretold.

564
01:30:04,877 --> 01:30:07,178
But just as she was lost to him forever,

565
01:30:08,158 --> 01:30:12,519
the legend of the child
with the blue eyes began

566
01:31:33,251 --> 01:31:37,582
Evolet had brought the
promise of life to our people.

567
01:31:37,732 --> 01:31:40,992
And now, with her last breath,

568
01:31:41,022 --> 01:31:43,693
Old Mother had given it back.

569
01:31:49,524 --> 01:31:52,734
Your father wanted to
bring these back to you.

570
01:31:53,124 --> 01:31:55,125
They will feed your people.

571
01:31:55,155 --> 01:31:59,245
Tell them the people of the
Yagahl thank the Naku people.

572
01:32:09,927 --> 01:32:13,187
Thank you, brother Nakudu.

573
01:32:15,638 --> 01:32:17,908
My heart walks with you, brother D'Leh.

574
01:32:29,700 --> 01:32:33,611
That was the last time they
saw their friends the Naku.

575
01:32:38,801 --> 01:32:41,832
And then the long journey home began.

576
01:32:57,624 --> 01:32:59,405
They're back! They're back!

577
01:33:05,686 --> 01:33:08,546
And as the ones who
walked with the Fathers

578
01:33:08,586 --> 01:33:10,907
looked down on them and guided their way,

579
01:33:11,007 --> 01:33:15,547
so the Yagahl looked to Evolet and D'Leh

580
01:33:15,877 --> 01:33:17,428
to guide their people.

581
01:33:18,968 --> 01:33:22,888
And when the first moon was
born again to their valley,

582
01:33:23,228 --> 01:33:27,279
it brought with it the
first fruits of their land.

583
01:33:27,609 --> 01:33:29,739
Look how fast it is growing.

584
01:33:39,601 --> 01:33:43,972
And so it came to pass
that the promise of life

585
01:33:44,012 --> 01:33:46,892
was fulfilled.
