1
00:00:53,957 --> 00:00:55,812
Sweetheart, remember that
you're doing pickup today

2
00:00:55,877 --> 00:00:57,568
and you need to call the
face painter for the party.

3
00:00:57,637 --> 00:00:58,881
Oh, and Henry
needs more Lactaid.

4
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:00,029
All right. Got it.

5
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,522
Pick up the kids, call the face
painter, get Lactaid. I got it.

6
00:01:02,661 --> 00:01:03,741
Also, I'm gonna drop
by the new house

7
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:04,795
and see how
the work's coming.

8
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:05,884
Oh, okay, awesome.

9
00:01:05,956 --> 00:01:07,004
Can you make sure
that you measure

10
00:01:07,077 --> 00:01:08,189
the backyard for
the bouncy castle?

11
00:01:08,261 --> 00:01:10,148
We're gonna have a bouncy
castle at our birthday party?

12
00:01:10,213 --> 00:01:11,457
- Do you want a bouncy castle?
- Yeah.

13
00:01:11,556 --> 00:01:13,728
Then, yes, we'll have the best
bouncy castle in the whole world!

14
00:01:13,797 --> 00:01:15,553
Bouncy castle! Bouncy castle!
Bouncy castle...

15
00:01:15,621 --> 00:01:17,279
And an Ultimate
Fighting Octagon?

16
00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:18,687
Uh... I don't know
about that.

17
00:01:18,757 --> 00:01:20,001
But, hey, you talked to me!

18
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,042
I was talking to Mommy.

19
00:01:22,405 --> 00:01:24,030
Okay, but just now,
you talked to me by saying that.

20
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,180
Why does she have
such a problem?

21
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:26,267
It's just a phase.
Don't push it.

22
00:01:26,341 --> 00:01:27,835
Hey, sweetheart,
it hurts Daddy's feelings

23
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:29,316
when you give him
the silent treatment.

24
00:01:29,604 --> 00:01:32,452
I'm ready for school, I'm ready for
school! Pick me up, pick me up!

25
00:01:32,517 --> 00:01:33,761
All right. Hey, Henry,

26
00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:35,171
you know you can't
bring Arthur to school.

27
00:01:35,237 --> 00:01:36,611
But he's my best friend.

28
00:01:36,676 --> 00:01:37,789
Honey, he's your
best lizard friend.

29
00:01:37,861 --> 00:01:39,584
You've got lots of
non-lizard friends.

30
00:01:39,717 --> 00:01:40,665
Not really.

31
00:01:41,445 --> 00:01:42,393
Really?

32
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:43,418
Nope.

33
00:01:43,813 --> 00:01:44,893
Oh. All right, have
a good day. I love you.

34
00:01:44,964 --> 00:01:46,012
You're kidding me!

35
00:01:46,085 --> 00:01:47,994
You can't take that to school,
monkey. Go put that in your room.

36
00:01:48,325 --> 00:01:49,535
Sam, I will see you.
I love you.

37
00:01:50,661 --> 00:01:51,774
- Sam.
- Hey.

38
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,274
- What? Yeah, oh, golly, okay.
- See you.

39
00:01:53,925 --> 00:01:55,616
Thanks. Love you.

40
00:02:01,828 --> 00:02:03,203
There he is!

41
00:02:04,453 --> 00:02:07,170
Hey, Randy. How you doing?

42
00:02:07,236 --> 00:02:08,185
Gregory Focker!

43
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,373
How's it going?

44
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:10,937
- Wonderful to see you.
- Great to see you.

45
00:02:11,013 --> 00:02:13,380
Listen, I just came by to check
out the backyard and measure

46
00:02:13,445 --> 00:02:15,747
'cause we want to do a bouncy
castle for the kids' birthday party.

47
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:17,121
Aw.

48
00:02:17,188 --> 00:02:18,846
That's terrific, Gregory.

49
00:02:32,741 --> 00:02:33,951
Okay, you're about
five minutes late.

50
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,165
Yeah, I know.

51
00:02:35,236 --> 00:02:37,440
A Miss Denslow from the
administrative board called.

52
00:02:37,508 --> 00:02:39,363
She wants to get a list
of the budget cuts.

53
00:02:39,428 --> 00:02:41,338
You have a meeting in 20
minutes with John Raider

54
00:02:41,413 --> 00:02:45,155
and some drug rep
from Pfosten Pharmaceuticals

55
00:02:45,221 --> 00:02:46,944
is waiting in your office.
Andi something.

56
00:02:47,012 --> 00:02:48,027
There's a drug rep in there?

57
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:49,083
Mmm-hmm.

58
00:02:49,157 --> 00:02:50,531
Okay, look,
in three minutes,

59
00:02:50,596 --> 00:02:52,419
pop your head in and tell me I
have to go to my next meeting.

60
00:02:52,485 --> 00:02:53,433
Okay.
All right?

61
00:02:53,861 --> 00:02:57,177
Sorry, I got to make this really quick.
I got a very busy morning.

62
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,282
I understand, Nurse Focker.
I'm Andi Garcia.

63
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:02,297
Oh, hi.

64
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,666
You have a lot less
stubble in person.

65
00:03:07,141 --> 00:03:09,148
I'm... There's an actor
named Andy Garcia.

66
00:03:09,477 --> 00:03:10,426
Who?

67
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,249
Widow's peak.
Sort of tough guy.

68
00:03:13,605 --> 00:03:17,118
I was just kidding. Of course,
I know who Andy Garcia is.

69
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:18,171
I get that all the time.

70
00:03:18,245 --> 00:03:19,706
Yeah. You must
get it all the time

71
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:21,188
'cause you're named
Andi Garcia.

72
00:03:21,253 --> 00:03:24,188
I loved the article you
wrote in the AMA Journal,

73
00:03:24,261 --> 00:03:25,690
"Putting Patients First"

74
00:03:25,925 --> 00:03:27,332
- You read that?
- I loved it.

75
00:03:27,621 --> 00:03:30,970
It was so cool getting a nurse's
perspective on the health care crisis.

76
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,451
Yeah, that was the idea.

77
00:03:32,517 --> 00:03:34,754
I actually started out
as a nurse, myself.

78
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:37,119
Really? Oh, well, nowadays,
I do less nursing and more...

79
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,554
Annoying meetings with drug
reps you'd rather not deal with?

80
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,243
Hey, Greg, it's time
for your next meeting.

81
00:03:42,501 --> 00:03:43,875
That's okay, I'm fine,
Kristen. Thank you.

82
00:03:43,941 --> 00:03:45,086
Yeah, but he doesn't
like to wait.

83
00:03:45,156 --> 00:03:46,367
You know
how he is, you know.

84
00:03:46,468 --> 00:03:47,679
Well, it's John Raider?

85
00:03:47,749 --> 00:03:48,926
Yeah, he's really picky...

86
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:51,069
He always runs late.
Always runs late. Thanks.

87
00:03:51,813 --> 00:03:53,602
- You're swamped.
- No, I'm good. You want to have a seat?

88
00:03:53,893 --> 00:03:54,875
Yeah.
Okay.

89
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:56,225
I'll make this quick.

90
00:03:56,293 --> 00:03:59,424
So we are launching a
killer new product at Pfosten

91
00:03:59,493 --> 00:04:04,228
and, while we usually hire
doctors to lead our presentations,

92
00:04:04,293 --> 00:04:05,537
I have a feeling about you.

93
00:04:05,924 --> 00:04:09,819
I think you have the potential
to be a medical superstar.

94
00:04:10,468 --> 00:04:15,683
And you'd be perfect to
represent our new drug, Sustengo.

95
00:04:16,644 --> 00:04:21,347
Ah. Sustengo. All right.
It's an erectile dysfunction medicine.

96
00:04:21,413 --> 00:04:23,868
It's not just any erectile
dysfunction medicine.

97
00:04:23,941 --> 00:04:27,421
It's the first ED pill on the
market safe for heart patients.

98
00:04:27,973 --> 00:04:31,966
Because, in addition to
increasing the penile blood flow...

99
00:04:32,037 --> 00:04:33,411
See that penis?

100
00:04:33,477 --> 00:04:35,167
It acts as
a beta blocker

101
00:04:35,236 --> 00:04:38,465
to keep the heart rate down
during intercourse.

102
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:39,842
I mean, how dope is that?

103
00:04:40,996 --> 00:04:42,141
That's pretty dope.

104
00:04:42,212 --> 00:04:43,641
Nurse Focker needed
in room 220B, stat.

105
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:45,888
I'm sorry,
hang on one second.

106
00:04:45,957 --> 00:04:47,964
Nurse Focker, room 220B.

107
00:04:48,133 --> 00:04:49,310
Will you get out of my ass?

108
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,718
If you would stop
squirming around...

109
00:04:50,788 --> 00:04:52,065
But you don't know
what you're doing.

110
00:04:52,133 --> 00:04:53,758
- It could have been over, sir.
- Hey, hey, hey.

111
00:04:53,828 --> 00:04:55,617
How you doing there, Mr.
Androvsky? Everything okay?

112
00:04:55,685 --> 00:04:56,962
Well, this nurse
is a barbarian.

113
00:04:57,029 --> 00:04:58,109
Okay, I'm not a barbarian.

114
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,522
He keeps clenching
and I can't make an insertion.

115
00:04:59,588 --> 00:05:00,701
Louis, it's...

116
00:05:00,773 --> 00:05:01,853
It's a natural response
to protect that cavity.

117
00:05:01,925 --> 00:05:03,266
You're right,
it is a natural response.

118
00:05:03,332 --> 00:05:05,220
I would protect
my cavity, too.

119
00:05:05,285 --> 00:05:06,627
And we just got to do it
a little bit gentler.

120
00:05:06,725 --> 00:05:08,219
May I suggest something?

121
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,944
Sir, why don't you
extend your left leg

122
00:05:11,012 --> 00:05:13,184
and put your right knee
right up to your chest.

123
00:05:13,253 --> 00:05:15,773
It'll help relax
things down there.

124
00:05:15,845 --> 00:05:17,055
She's right.

125
00:05:17,124 --> 00:05:19,546
You just do that and you just grab
the side of the bed there, like that,

126
00:05:19,621 --> 00:05:20,733
and exhale...

127
00:05:20,804 --> 00:05:22,779
Nurse, did you sufficiently
lubricate the nozzle?

128
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,224
- I did do that.
- Great.

129
00:05:24,292 --> 00:05:25,819
Good, good, okay.
You got this?

130
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:27,103
Yep.

131
00:05:27,172 --> 00:05:28,863
All right.
Take a nice deep breath.

132
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:35,169
And focus
on relaxing your anus.

133
00:05:35,237 --> 00:05:38,172
Right. That's right.
You just want to let it dilate,

134
00:05:38,244 --> 00:05:41,146
sort of like
a flower opening up.

135
00:05:41,445 --> 00:05:42,786
Blossoming lotus.

136
00:05:43,461 --> 00:05:45,533
Sort of like
a desert cactus.

137
00:05:45,861 --> 00:05:46,843
Maturing.

138
00:05:46,917 --> 00:05:47,932
It's okay.

139
00:05:48,005 --> 00:05:51,452
Just a little, friendly
visitor just saying hello.

140
00:05:52,388 --> 00:05:54,560
All right, I'm just gonna
stick it in a little further.

141
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:55,676
Oh!

142
00:05:56,676 --> 00:05:58,105
Good smooth insertion.

143
00:05:58,181 --> 00:05:59,457
Thank you.

144
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:03,202
I'm gonna release the
clamp and let it flow.

145
00:06:03,525 --> 00:06:04,866
Better.

146
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:06,494
How's that?

147
00:06:06,565 --> 00:06:07,547
That was great.

148
00:06:11,557 --> 00:06:13,018
Nice technique.

149
00:06:13,093 --> 00:06:14,522
That was so fun.

150
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:16,643
Yeah, yeah.

151
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,164
I was thinking about it
and, honestly,

152
00:06:19,237 --> 00:06:21,888
I just don't have time to
moonlight pitching a drug right now.

153
00:06:21,957 --> 00:06:23,134
Shot down.

154
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,794
No, it's not you.
It's just...

155
00:06:24,868 --> 00:06:26,810
No, I get it, you know.

156
00:06:26,885 --> 00:06:29,187
Running nursing
in med-surge is a big job.

157
00:06:29,445 --> 00:06:30,852
Yeah, yeah, so big,

158
00:06:30,917 --> 00:06:32,608
I'm making less than I did
when I was in the ER.

159
00:06:32,677 --> 00:06:35,132
Look, we are sponsoring
a convention at the Hilton.

160
00:06:35,205 --> 00:06:36,187
Mmm-hmm.

161
00:06:36,261 --> 00:06:39,905
You can make tons of dough
for, like, one speech.

162
00:06:39,973 --> 00:06:40,922
Think about it.

163
00:06:41,893 --> 00:06:43,519
Okay. I will,
I'll think about it. Okay.

164
00:06:43,845 --> 00:06:45,121
Knuckles?

165
00:06:45,188 --> 00:06:46,137
Knuckles.

166
00:06:46,213 --> 00:06:48,253
That was bad-ass,
by the way.

167
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:50,332
Yeah. Literally.

168
00:07:20,165 --> 00:07:21,594
Dr. Bob.

169
00:07:22,757 --> 00:07:24,131
Scumbag.

170
00:07:25,604 --> 00:07:27,939
Jack, my taxi's here.

171
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:30,884
Oh, honey,
I just got off with Deb.

172
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:32,956
They are
officially separated.

173
00:07:33,028 --> 00:07:35,167
Dr. Bob finished moving out.

174
00:07:35,237 --> 00:07:36,797
That lowlife.

175
00:07:36,868 --> 00:07:38,494
Yeah. You can
say that again.

176
00:07:38,565 --> 00:07:39,645
You sure you don't want me
to come with you?

177
00:07:39,748 --> 00:07:41,025
No, you know,
I think Deb needs

178
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:42,434
a little mother-daughter
time, honey.

179
00:07:42,501 --> 00:07:43,449
All right?

180
00:07:43,717 --> 00:07:44,862
Having an affair
with a nurse.

181
00:07:44,933 --> 00:07:46,460
I can't believe I didn't
see the warning signs.

182
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:47,907
He was very discreet.

183
00:07:47,973 --> 00:07:51,235
She didn't even know until
she saw those text messages.

184
00:07:51,301 --> 00:07:52,249
Whatever you call them.

185
00:07:52,325 --> 00:07:54,235
Yeah, but I'm trained to detect
that sort of behavior, honey,

186
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:56,643
and the truth is I was so busy
putting Focker through the wringer,

187
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,334
Dr. Bob slipped
right under my radar.

188
00:07:58,404 --> 00:07:59,997
Oh, don't be
so hard on yourself.

189
00:08:00,068 --> 00:08:03,167
Well, I'll never
let that happen again.

190
00:08:04,997 --> 00:08:07,582
Are you having one of your
little heart palpies again, Jack?

191
00:08:07,652 --> 00:08:09,889
My muscles are
a little tight!

192
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:11,266
Yeah, yeah.
From stress.

193
00:08:11,332 --> 00:08:15,261
I can see that. Okay, will you just,
please, just relax, okay?

194
00:08:15,332 --> 00:08:17,536
Everything is gonna be
all right. Honest.

195
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:20,611
- Oh, I got to go.
- Okay.

196
00:08:20,676 --> 00:08:21,887
I'm gonna miss you.

197
00:08:29,797 --> 00:08:30,745
Hey, Mom.

198
00:08:30,884 --> 00:08:33,852
Hello, my precious prince,
how are you, darling?

199
00:08:33,924 --> 00:08:35,331
Good. How's the TV show going?

200
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:38,623
Oh, great. You know what
this week's episode is about?

201
00:08:38,693 --> 00:08:41,889
Using the latest sexual toys
to spice up your love life.

202
00:08:41,956 --> 00:08:42,905
- Really?
- Yeah.

203
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,290
As an early Hanukkah present,

204
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,812
I'm gonna send you and Pam a
box of these musical condoms.

205
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:48,251
Don't do that.

206
00:08:48,324 --> 00:08:51,008
You got to hear this, honey.
There's a little speaker inside.

207
00:08:51,077 --> 00:08:53,630
And the faster you go,
the louder it gets.

208
00:08:53,861 --> 00:08:56,447
You know what? Mom, Pam and I are
fine. We don't need musical condoms.

209
00:08:56,804 --> 00:08:59,259
Honey, every couple can use
a little stimulation.

210
00:08:59,461 --> 00:09:01,316
Oh, by the way,
interesting episode last week.

211
00:09:01,381 --> 00:09:02,974
Which one?
"Masturbation Through The Ages"?

212
00:09:03,045 --> 00:09:04,157
I thought we agreed
you weren't gonna

213
00:09:04,228 --> 00:09:05,308
talk about me
on the air anymore.

214
00:09:05,381 --> 00:09:08,447
Please, it was just a little anecdote
about carpal tunnel syndrome

215
00:09:08,517 --> 00:09:10,339
from excessive
self-pleasuring.

216
00:09:10,596 --> 00:09:12,418
I have to connect
your father now, okay?

217
00:09:12,772 --> 00:09:14,266
We need to
tell you something.

218
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,249
Ooh.

219
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:25,339
Hi! Gay? Roz?

220
00:09:25,604 --> 00:09:26,586
- Hello?
- Yeah, I'm here.

221
00:09:26,661 --> 00:09:27,676
- Gaylord?
- Dad?

222
00:09:27,749 --> 00:09:28,697
- Can you hear me?
- Where are you?

223
00:09:28,773 --> 00:09:30,496
You won't believe it.
I'm in Seville, Spain.

224
00:09:30,693 --> 00:09:31,838
Where... What are
you doing in Spain?

225
00:09:32,645 --> 00:09:33,627
I'm studying.

226
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,740
Sweetheart,
your father decided that

227
00:09:35,812 --> 00:09:37,306
he's not gonna make
it to the twins' party.

228
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,329
What?

229
00:09:38,405 --> 00:09:39,681
Gay, you remember
when your mother's show

230
00:09:39,748 --> 00:09:40,861
hit number one
in the ratings

231
00:09:40,933 --> 00:09:42,427
and she signed on
for a second year?

232
00:09:42,501 --> 00:09:44,922
I looked in the mirror
and I said, "Who am I?"

233
00:09:45,253 --> 00:09:46,911
Then I see this
clip on the YouTube

234
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,697
and there is a Spanish guy
and he's dancing the flamenco.

235
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,804
And the sweat is
pouring off of his face

236
00:09:51,876 --> 00:09:53,567
and there is such
passion in his eyes

237
00:09:53,637 --> 00:09:55,328
- and I said, "That's it!"
- That's what?

238
00:09:55,653 --> 00:09:59,101
That's me. I am flamenco!
I will master this art.

239
00:09:59,173 --> 00:10:01,147
Dad, this is crazy.
What are you doing? You're in Spain?

240
00:10:01,221 --> 00:10:02,301
You're gonna miss the party?

241
00:10:02,373 --> 00:10:04,795
You picked a hell of a time
to go through man-opause.

242
00:10:04,868 --> 00:10:06,592
Roz, I am not going
through man-opause,

243
00:10:06,661 --> 00:10:08,319
I'm just trying to find
my true north.

244
00:10:08,485 --> 00:10:10,372
True north, huh? What are you,
a compass or something?

245
00:10:10,565 --> 00:10:11,514
No, but let's face it.

246
00:10:11,588 --> 00:10:12,701
I'm a stay-at-home dad

247
00:10:12,773 --> 00:10:14,780
whose kid hasn't lived
at home in 25 years.

248
00:10:14,853 --> 00:10:17,471
There's an Arthur Murray
studio right here in Miami Beach.

249
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,035
Why schlep
all the way to Spain?

250
00:10:19,172 --> 00:10:20,285
I can't believe you, Roz.

251
00:10:20,484 --> 00:10:21,826
Why can't you
support my dreams

252
00:10:21,892 --> 00:10:23,299
the way I have
always supported yours?

253
00:10:23,364 --> 00:10:24,771
- Guys, guys...
- When you wanted to try

254
00:10:24,837 --> 00:10:27,836
new sex positions for your
research, I was your guinea pig!

255
00:10:28,037 --> 00:10:28,985
You volunteered.

256
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:30,468
- I pulled my hamstring...
- Hey! Hey!

257
00:10:30,532 --> 00:10:31,710
...doing a reverse cowgirl!

258
00:10:31,844 --> 00:10:33,088
That's because
you did it backwards.

259
00:10:33,349 --> 00:10:34,527
I never went soft on you.

260
00:10:34,757 --> 00:10:36,186
Bernie, do you hear
how you're upsetting your son?

261
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:38,017
Let me talk.
Listen, will you?

262
00:10:41,221 --> 00:10:42,977
That son of a bitch.

263
00:10:57,637 --> 00:10:59,295
Oh, shit.

264
00:11:02,212 --> 00:11:03,936
Oh, shit.

265
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,061
- Hello?
- 911, what's your emergency?

266
00:11:12,133 --> 00:11:14,588
Yeah, my name is Jack Byrnes.
I live at 28 Cherry Blossom Lane.

267
00:11:14,661 --> 00:11:15,905
I'm going into cardiac arrest.

268
00:11:15,973 --> 00:11:17,729
I need an ambulance
right away.

269
00:11:17,797 --> 00:11:19,390
I'm guessing your average
response time at this hour

270
00:11:19,461 --> 00:11:21,021
is between 12 and 17 minutes.

271
00:11:21,093 --> 00:11:23,362
I need you to do better than that.
Thank you, goodbye.

272
00:11:33,157 --> 00:11:35,578
Stay calm, Mr. Jinx.
I'm going to defibrillate myself.

273
00:11:36,645 --> 00:11:37,593
Clear!

274
00:11:40,164 --> 00:11:42,139
Seriously, though, my dad,
he always sounds a little crazy,

275
00:11:42,213 --> 00:11:43,707
but this was like
a whole different level.

276
00:11:44,165 --> 00:11:46,019
- No, I mean they were really going at it.
- Really?

277
00:11:46,085 --> 00:11:47,611
She accused him of
going through man-opause.

278
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,849
Is that a real thing?

279
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,482
Your parents have the best
marriage of anyone I know.

280
00:11:51,557 --> 00:11:52,505
They will be fine.

281
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,307
Yeah, I guess so.

282
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:55,577
You were talking
about the kids.

283
00:11:55,653 --> 00:11:57,693
Really, their teacher
suggested private school?

284
00:11:57,765 --> 00:12:00,066
Yeah, she said she was
concerned about them "getting lost"

285
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:01,594
in the public school
system or something.

286
00:12:01,797 --> 00:12:03,171
What's the name
of this place?

287
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,667
The Early Human School.

288
00:12:06,245 --> 00:12:08,067
I have absolutely
heard of that place.

289
00:12:08,548 --> 00:12:10,075
Sounds like a school
for Neanderthals.

290
00:12:10,213 --> 00:12:13,279
No, it's actually considered
the Harvard of kindergartens.

291
00:12:13,477 --> 00:12:15,037
Mmm. Well, I think
Harvard's cheaper.

292
00:12:16,292 --> 00:12:17,241
I'll go see who that is.

293
00:12:17,477 --> 00:12:20,608
Hey, greetings from the
Black Sea. You look terrific.

294
00:12:20,836 --> 00:12:23,357
Hi, stranger, thanks.
What are you doing there?

295
00:12:23,429 --> 00:12:26,276
Listen, Pam. Is there any
way I could speak to Greg?

296
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,609
I want to get his advice on
something, believe it or not.

297
00:12:28,677 --> 00:12:29,659
Sure, absolutely. Hey, Greg?

298
00:12:29,732 --> 00:12:30,715
Yeah.

299
00:12:30,788 --> 00:12:32,730
Greg, honey,
it's your buddy, Kevin.

300
00:12:32,804 --> 00:12:33,982
- Hold on.
- Thank you.

301
00:12:34,276 --> 00:12:35,585
- Hey.
- Hey.

302
00:12:35,684 --> 00:12:36,666
How you doing, man?

303
00:12:36,933 --> 00:12:38,689
I was just doing
a little sailing

304
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,764
and living the dream,
G-Diggity-Dog.

305
00:12:40,996 --> 00:12:41,945
- Cheers!
- Kevin.

306
00:12:42,021 --> 00:12:43,646
- Hey.
- You need a refill on that

307
00:12:43,716 --> 00:12:45,025
goji berry smoothie?

308
00:12:45,284 --> 00:12:47,456
You read my mind.
Fill her up, Pak-Man.

309
00:12:47,716 --> 00:12:49,342
Greg, you know
Deepak Chopra, right?

310
00:12:49,925 --> 00:12:50,874
I know of him.

311
00:12:51,077 --> 00:12:52,899
- Hi, Greg.
- Hi, Mr. Chopra.

312
00:12:53,061 --> 00:12:54,523
Dr. Chopra.

313
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:56,865
Get out of here,
you rascal.

314
00:12:57,412 --> 00:13:01,885
So, listen, the reason why I'm
calling is because next week...

315
00:13:01,956 --> 00:13:03,811
Kevin, who do
you Skype with?

316
00:13:03,876 --> 00:13:06,462
I am just talking
to my friend, Greg Focker.

317
00:13:07,012 --> 00:13:08,223
- Hey.
- Come here.

318
00:13:11,301 --> 00:13:13,057
Hey, honey, what'd you
do with Henry's Lactaid?

319
00:13:14,181 --> 00:13:15,872
Oh, crap, I forgot. Sorry.

320
00:13:16,133 --> 00:13:17,409
Well, okay. But did you
call the face-paint lady?

321
00:13:18,021 --> 00:13:19,548
No, I'm sorry.

322
00:13:19,621 --> 00:13:21,312
I had, like,
97 things to do, so...

323
00:13:21,381 --> 00:13:24,098
Honey, I asked you to do
two things, that's all I asked.

324
00:13:24,165 --> 00:13:25,539
I know. Sorry, babe.

325
00:13:29,413 --> 00:13:31,900
Okay, so here's the dealio.

326
00:13:31,972 --> 00:13:34,209
I'm going to propose
to Svetlana.

327
00:13:34,789 --> 00:13:37,244
You're gonna propose?
That's incredible.

328
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:40,514
I'm gonna have three Russian
MiG fighter jets fly by

329
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,849
and skywrite
"Marry me, Svetlana".

330
00:13:42,917 --> 00:13:47,706
And then I'm gonna hide a
50-carat super-tasteful diamond ring

331
00:13:47,781 --> 00:13:49,952
in this tin of
extremely rare beluga.

332
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,409
Then we will
finish the night

333
00:13:52,484 --> 00:13:55,234
with a special performance
that I choreographed

334
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:58,682
with members of the Bolshoi
Ballet, dedicated to our love.

335
00:13:58,756 --> 00:13:59,771
Thoughts?

336
00:14:00,453 --> 00:14:02,395
Honestly, I'm thinking
maybe it's a little too involved.

337
00:14:02,596 --> 00:14:03,545
Yeah?

338
00:14:03,621 --> 00:14:05,595
I mean, with Pam,
my whole thing was just

339
00:14:05,668 --> 00:14:07,807
keep it simple,
speak from the heart.

340
00:14:08,741 --> 00:14:13,476
Keep it simple and speak from
the heart. I like it, hombre.

341
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:16,770
You know what? I'd better call
off some Russian MiG fighter jets.

342
00:14:16,836 --> 00:14:19,651
And, hey, by the time
I get to Chi-town,

343
00:14:19,716 --> 00:14:22,466
this old dog here
could be an engaged man.

344
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,831
- Hey, Kevin?
- Yeah.

345
00:14:24,901 --> 00:14:25,849
The jet skis are ready!

346
00:14:25,925 --> 00:14:26,874
The jet skis are ready?

347
00:14:26,948 --> 00:14:28,541
- Well, fire 'em up for me.
- Okay.

348
00:14:28,612 --> 00:14:30,303
I'll be right there.

349
00:14:30,725 --> 00:14:32,002
Jet-skiing monks.

350
00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:36,542
Wow, I cannot believe that
Kevin is finally settling down.

351
00:14:36,613 --> 00:14:37,922
Well, I think
he's found a soul mate.

352
00:14:37,989 --> 00:14:38,971
Yeah?

353
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,281
Hey, you're gonna eat some
of this. She seemed nice.

354
00:14:41,765 --> 00:14:44,099
Yeah. I am very happy
for Kevin.

355
00:14:44,165 --> 00:14:46,205
I love him, especially when
he's not obsessed with you.

356
00:14:46,533 --> 00:14:48,126
Oh, come on.
You're being ridiculous.

357
00:14:48,549 --> 00:14:50,043
Oh, you got it?

358
00:14:50,213 --> 00:14:51,358
Hey, sweetheart,
will you please

359
00:14:51,429 --> 00:14:52,541
take a bite of
the lasagna, honey?

360
00:14:52,612 --> 00:14:54,587
- No.
- Do you not like it?

361
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:56,803
Hey, what's the good word,
Grandpa Jack?

362
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,169
Yay!

363
00:14:58,309 --> 00:14:59,258
Greg.

364
00:14:59,461 --> 00:15:00,508
This is Jack Byrnes.

365
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,514
Yeah, I know.
I could tell from the caller ID.

366
00:15:03,749 --> 00:15:04,697
How are you doing?

367
00:15:04,773 --> 00:15:07,839
Greg, excuse yourself from the
table by saying these exact words,

368
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:11,106
"I don't know if I still have it,
but let me check my files."

369
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:13,372
- What?
- If Pam asks you what I want,

370
00:15:13,605 --> 00:15:15,939
tell her that I asked you to
locate your birth certificate

371
00:15:16,004 --> 00:15:17,281
for my genealogical work.

372
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,817
Just do it.

373
00:15:20,581 --> 00:15:23,930
I don't know if I have that,
Jack, but let me check my files.

374
00:15:24,581 --> 00:15:26,010
Files? You have files?

375
00:15:26,661 --> 00:15:30,273
Yes, yeah, I do.
I keep files.

376
00:15:30,341 --> 00:15:31,585
He wants me to get
my birth certificate

377
00:15:31,653 --> 00:15:33,442
for that family tree thing
he's doing.

378
00:15:34,821 --> 00:15:36,828
Jack? Everything okay?

379
00:15:37,124 --> 00:15:40,256
Everything is fine, Greg,
I suffered a minor heart attack,

380
00:15:40,325 --> 00:15:42,048
but I was able to
defibrillate myself

381
00:15:42,117 --> 00:15:43,808
before going into
fatal cardiac arrest.

382
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,108
Jesus!
You defibrillated yourself?

383
00:15:46,276 --> 00:15:47,520
The doctor said
I was a lucky man

384
00:15:47,588 --> 00:15:48,799
and I've just
got to watch my diet

385
00:15:48,869 --> 00:15:50,014
and keep my stress level down.

386
00:15:50,277 --> 00:15:52,797
Wow, okay, so I guess

387
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,778
you guys aren't gonna be able to
come to the twins' birthday party.

388
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:57,122
No, Dina and I will be
there as planned, Greg.

389
00:15:57,188 --> 00:16:00,701
And I was able to keep this
on a need-to-know basis.

390
00:16:00,772 --> 00:16:03,358
And right now, you're the only
person who needs to know.

391
00:16:03,556 --> 00:16:06,426
Well, come on, Jack.
I mean, I think Dina needs to know.

392
00:16:06,692 --> 00:16:07,903
Greg, stop talking and listen.

393
00:16:07,973 --> 00:16:09,053
Okay.

394
00:16:09,253 --> 00:16:12,188
Now, my genealogical research has
allowed me to track the Byrnes family

395
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:14,083
as far back as 1643.

396
00:16:14,437 --> 00:16:15,647
1643?

397
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:18,338
Now, I wouldn't be able to
do that, say, to your family,

398
00:16:18,404 --> 00:16:20,641
what with all the wandering
peddlers and nameless peasants.

399
00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:21,691
Mmm-hmm.

400
00:16:21,765 --> 00:16:22,713
But, as long as there
have been Byrneses,

401
00:16:22,789 --> 00:16:24,065
there's always
been a patriarch

402
00:16:24,133 --> 00:16:26,042
to lead our family through
good times and bad.

403
00:16:26,117 --> 00:16:27,905
And I've finally
come to the realization

404
00:16:27,973 --> 00:16:31,071
that the next in line
to the throne, Greg,

405
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,155
is you.

406
00:16:32,773 --> 00:16:33,721
Me.

407
00:16:35,588 --> 00:16:37,017
Yes, you, Greg.

408
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:39,390
- Well...
- So my question is this,

409
00:16:39,909 --> 00:16:42,658
in the event of my demise,
are you prepared to lead this family?

410
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:46,044
You know, Jack, we're right
in the middle of dinner.

411
00:16:46,117 --> 00:16:48,353
Maybe we could talk about this,
you know, when you come into town.

412
00:16:48,805 --> 00:16:51,390
If I go down, Greg, I need to
know someone will be responsible

413
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,151
for the whole Byrnes clan.

414
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,635
So I ask you, Greg,
are you prepared to be

415
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,609
the Godfocker?

416
00:17:01,764 --> 00:17:03,357
The Godfocker?

417
00:17:03,845 --> 00:17:05,154
The Godfocker.

418
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:10,270
Well, that is a very powerful
turn of phrase, Jack.

419
00:17:10,341 --> 00:17:14,781
And when you say Godfocker,
I mean...

420
00:17:14,852 --> 00:17:17,722
I mean, I think I know what
you mean, but I'm just...

421
00:17:17,797 --> 00:17:20,317
What exactly does that mean?

422
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,969
It's an attitude, Greg.
It's a confidence.

423
00:17:24,036 --> 00:17:25,149
It's the way
you carry yourself

424
00:17:25,221 --> 00:17:27,642
that lets the world know
that the buck stops with you.

425
00:17:29,956 --> 00:17:31,265
Yeah, I hear you.

426
00:17:31,589 --> 00:17:34,338
None of this can be achieved
without the basics.

427
00:17:34,404 --> 00:17:35,615
A secure home for your family,

428
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,493
a top-notch education
for your children...

429
00:17:38,629 --> 00:17:39,578
Okay.

430
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:42,368
...and last but not least, having
your financial house in order, Greg.

431
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,451
Is that it?

432
00:17:43,685 --> 00:17:44,929
Are you laughing?

433
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,590
Yeah, no, I'm just...
I was making... No.

434
00:17:46,757 --> 00:17:48,186
Because this is no
laughing matter, Greg.

435
00:17:48,613 --> 00:17:50,718
Good, 'cause
I'm not laughing. Okay?

436
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:54,051
Are you saying you have what
it takes to be the Godfocker?

437
00:17:55,876 --> 00:17:56,989
Greg?

438
00:17:58,469 --> 00:18:01,535
Yes, Jack.
I have what it takes

439
00:18:03,077 --> 00:18:04,932
to be the Godfocker.

440
00:18:06,469 --> 00:18:09,316
I feel like a great weight has
been lifted off my shoulders.

441
00:18:10,053 --> 00:18:12,704
And an equally
great weight put onto yours.

442
00:18:13,189 --> 00:18:16,505
I like it.
I like the weight. I want it.

443
00:18:17,444 --> 00:18:19,419
All right. Need-to-know.

444
00:18:19,524 --> 00:18:20,801
Need-to-know.
Just you and me.

445
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:21,851
See you in two weeks.

446
00:18:21,925 --> 00:18:23,681
Okay. Bye.

447
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:32,735
Hey, did you find it?

448
00:18:32,804 --> 00:18:34,397
Find what?

449
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:36,313
Your birth certificate?

450
00:18:37,381 --> 00:18:38,941
Yes. It was in my files.

451
00:18:40,805 --> 00:18:41,753
You know, I was thinking,
maybe we should

452
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,968
take a look at that
Early Human School.

453
00:18:44,645 --> 00:18:47,034
Great. I'll make some
phone calls and set up a tour.

454
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,086
- Good.
- Good.

455
00:18:50,757 --> 00:18:51,705
Samantha.

456
00:18:55,525 --> 00:18:56,473
Henry.

457
00:18:57,861 --> 00:18:58,974
You gonna have your lasagna?

458
00:18:59,461 --> 00:19:00,705
No, thank you.

459
00:19:04,581 --> 00:19:07,778
You know, your mother worked very
hard making that lasagna for you.

460
00:19:08,293 --> 00:19:09,787
No. It tastes funny.

461
00:19:10,469 --> 00:19:12,770
He said he was feeling
kind of queasy, so...

462
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,329
It's okay.

463
00:19:16,453 --> 00:19:17,697
Henry,

464
00:19:17,765 --> 00:19:21,660
I'm your father and I'm
requesting of you to eat the lasagna.

465
00:19:23,844 --> 00:19:25,088
Fine.

466
00:19:26,693 --> 00:19:27,870
Good.

467
00:19:44,677 --> 00:19:46,499
- Hello.
- Hello?

468
00:19:46,565 --> 00:19:48,223
Greg? This is Jack Byrnes.

469
00:19:48,292 --> 00:19:50,180
Jack Byrnes,
this is Greg Focker.

470
00:19:50,245 --> 00:19:51,838
I know, Greg. I called you.

471
00:19:52,197 --> 00:19:55,099
Dina and I will be there
in approximately 18 seconds.

472
00:19:55,172 --> 00:19:56,514
Eighteen seconds, got it.

473
00:20:09,893 --> 00:20:11,748
Oh, no,
that's yours, honey.

474
00:20:11,813 --> 00:20:13,089
Welcome, in-laws!

475
00:20:13,317 --> 00:20:16,034
Oh, Gregor.
My goodness.

476
00:20:16,836 --> 00:20:19,586
Dina, Dina Bobina,
Banana Fana Fofina.

477
00:20:19,653 --> 00:20:21,409
I'm so happy to see you.

478
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:22,969
Lovely Dina.

479
00:20:23,269 --> 00:20:24,381
You, too, Gregor.

480
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:26,075
Hello, Jack.

481
00:20:26,149 --> 00:20:27,131
Greg.

482
00:20:32,869 --> 00:20:33,948
Everything okay, Greg?

483
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,097
Everything's great.

484
00:20:35,365 --> 00:20:36,313
Good.

485
00:20:36,421 --> 00:20:38,428
Unfortunately,
renovations on the house,

486
00:20:38,501 --> 00:20:40,257
not quite where
I'd like them to be.

487
00:20:40,484 --> 00:20:41,728
Well, those things happen.

488
00:20:42,085 --> 00:20:44,157
They do. I mean,
never to me before.

489
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:53,313
And Sam here has done very,
very well with her tae kwon do lessons.

490
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,329
She's a... What are you?
A yellow belt now?

491
00:20:54,405 --> 00:20:55,387
Yep.

492
00:20:55,461 --> 00:20:56,443
Yellow belt.

493
00:20:56,517 --> 00:20:57,727
Wow, sweetheart.
Very impressive.

494
00:20:57,797 --> 00:21:00,033
She's lethal.
She is a ninja.

495
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,148
Proud of her.

496
00:21:01,221 --> 00:21:05,279
Now, Henry, you're going to
drink your milk, aren't you?

497
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:07,388
You want to hit the same
growth spurt as your sister.

498
00:21:07,461 --> 00:21:08,443
Jack.

499
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,727
I'm just saying, you know,
it's hard to believe

500
00:21:09,796 --> 00:21:10,876
that they're
three minutes apart.

501
00:21:10,948 --> 00:21:11,897
Shh.

502
00:21:11,972 --> 00:21:13,860
Henry, do what
your grandpa says.

503
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,617
- Aw, man.
- For real.

504
00:21:16,645 --> 00:21:17,593
Good man.

505
00:21:18,565 --> 00:21:20,223
Okay. Who wants some turkey?

506
00:21:20,293 --> 00:21:21,820
I do, right here!
Right here!

507
00:21:22,341 --> 00:21:24,959
Sweetheart, you didn't have to
make a whole turkey just for us.

508
00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:25,977
Why not?

509
00:21:26,116 --> 00:21:27,065
Actually, Greg did it.

510
00:21:27,524 --> 00:21:28,473
Greg.

511
00:21:28,613 --> 00:21:30,304
Well, I remember
at last year's Thanksgiving,

512
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:31,998
Jack said he liked
roast turkey so much

513
00:21:32,068 --> 00:21:34,075
and he couldn't understand why
people only had it once a year.

514
00:21:34,244 --> 00:21:35,771
Excellent memory, Greg.

515
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:38,975
Plus, it's a wonderfully lean meat.
Healthy. Good for your heart.

516
00:21:40,485 --> 00:21:41,565
Such a sweetheart.

517
00:21:42,405 --> 00:21:43,746
Grandpa Jack,
can I ask you a question?

518
00:21:43,813 --> 00:21:45,089
You surely can.

519
00:21:45,156 --> 00:21:46,749
How come you're afraid
of lizards?

520
00:21:46,853 --> 00:21:50,301
Henry, that's a very good
question. And I'll tell you why.

521
00:21:50,372 --> 00:21:53,275
When I was stationed in the Mekong
Delta during the Vietnam War,

522
00:21:53,348 --> 00:21:56,796
a tiny gecko crawled into my
ear one night and laid its eggs.

523
00:21:56,869 --> 00:22:01,309
And I had to endure the torturous
probing of our unit's medic

524
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,388
to remove the lizard larvae
from my ear canal

525
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,435
before they hatched
into my brain.

526
00:22:05,509 --> 00:22:06,621
Jack.

527
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:07,641
Cool.

528
00:22:08,133 --> 00:22:09,115
Yuck.

529
00:22:09,189 --> 00:22:10,618
Yes, thanks for
sharing that, Dad.

530
00:22:10,757 --> 00:22:15,230
All right, gobble, gobble,
everybody! It's turkey time!

531
00:22:16,965 --> 00:22:19,201
That looks good.
That's a work of art.

532
00:22:19,301 --> 00:22:20,316
Thank you very much.

533
00:22:20,421 --> 00:22:21,370
Looks great, Greg.

534
00:22:21,796 --> 00:22:24,163
Thank you, Jack.
And to carve it,

535
00:22:24,229 --> 00:22:27,578
I thought we might use the
beautiful Irish hunting knife

536
00:22:27,652 --> 00:22:29,791
emblazoned with
the Byrnes family crest

537
00:22:29,861 --> 00:22:32,316
that Jack so thoughtfully
brought back for us

538
00:22:32,389 --> 00:22:34,396
from his ancestral homeland.

539
00:22:35,525 --> 00:22:36,834
- Look at that, kids.
- Great.

540
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,144
- Wow.
- Look at that.

541
00:22:38,212 --> 00:22:41,060
See that crest?
That was used by your ancestors

542
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:44,224
long time ago, back in the olden
days, to identify their family.

543
00:22:44,709 --> 00:22:46,083
Daddy, can I ask
you a question?

544
00:22:46,244 --> 00:22:48,961
Absolutely. He loves history.
Just soaks it up.

545
00:22:49,765 --> 00:22:51,554
Can a girl poop
from her vagina?

546
00:22:54,436 --> 00:22:55,745
No, she cannot.

547
00:22:56,037 --> 00:22:57,052
They're a little
young for genealogy.

548
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,107
Yes.

549
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,741
Just a little off topic there.

550
00:23:00,196 --> 00:23:02,051
Jack. Here you go!

551
00:23:02,245 --> 00:23:05,092
Greg. You're
the turkey carver now.

552
00:23:06,277 --> 00:23:07,487
Thank you. I'm honored.

553
00:23:09,317 --> 00:23:11,935
All right. Let's carve
the roast beast!

554
00:23:12,005 --> 00:23:12,987
Mmm.

555
00:23:13,061 --> 00:23:14,555
Let's see. I think
I'll start right side.

556
00:23:14,629 --> 00:23:16,058
Nice and tender.

557
00:23:17,413 --> 00:23:19,933
So, Greg, how are you
liking your new job?

558
00:23:20,773 --> 00:23:21,820
Well, I'll tell you, Dina,

559
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:24,765
it's a lot of responsibility
on my plate.

560
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:27,710
But that's kind of
what I love about it.

561
00:23:28,517 --> 00:23:30,688
I mean, the opportunity
to manage an entire unit,

562
00:23:31,268 --> 00:23:32,283
in a way,
it's kind of like...

563
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,203
- Christ!
- Shit!

564
00:23:40,133 --> 00:23:41,955
Why couldn't you just get him
a warm-blooded animal?

565
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:43,460
- Pressure.
- Mom!

566
00:23:44,677 --> 00:23:45,659
Honey. It's okay,
it's okay, honey.

567
00:23:45,733 --> 00:23:47,489
- Hello.
- Where is he going? Are you okay?

568
00:23:47,557 --> 00:23:48,702
Hey, Kevin!

569
00:23:48,773 --> 00:23:50,529
It's Kevin, everybody.

570
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:51,545
What?

571
00:23:52,517 --> 00:23:53,629
You're in Chicago?

572
00:24:00,133 --> 00:24:01,955
Hey. Hey.

573
00:24:02,213 --> 00:24:04,068
- Hey, everybody. Hello.
- Kevin.

574
00:24:04,133 --> 00:24:05,409
J.B.

575
00:24:05,732 --> 00:24:07,521
Oh! Good to see you.

576
00:24:08,165 --> 00:24:10,466
There he is!
The engaged guy!

577
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:11,645
How you doing, man?

578
00:24:11,813 --> 00:24:12,827
Oh! What happened
to your pointer?

579
00:24:12,933 --> 00:24:16,249
I had a little incident with the
business end of a turkey. It's cool.

580
00:24:16,357 --> 00:24:17,437
- Where's Svetlana?
- Yeah!

581
00:24:17,509 --> 00:24:20,291
Or should I say, the future
Mrs. Kevin Rawley?

582
00:24:21,188 --> 00:24:22,563
She broke up with me.

583
00:24:22,725 --> 00:24:24,448
- No.
- Oh.

584
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,529
You're kidding.

585
00:24:25,605 --> 00:24:26,685
I'm so sorry.

586
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:27,771
Thanks, Pam.

587
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,541
You always know exactly
the right thing to say to me.

588
00:24:33,285 --> 00:24:34,233
"I'm so sorry"?

589
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,890
My anchor.

590
00:24:37,348 --> 00:24:38,297
What happened?

591
00:24:38,533 --> 00:24:40,158
- What?
- What happened?

592
00:24:40,709 --> 00:24:43,010
I don't know. I'm still trying
to make sense of it myself.

593
00:24:43,077 --> 00:24:45,051
We were having
some street food

594
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:47,035
outside a government
building in Bulgaria

595
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,049
and I said, "Hey, you want
to get married?"

596
00:24:49,124 --> 00:24:50,946
And I took out
a little piece of string

597
00:24:51,013 --> 00:24:52,801
and I tied the twine
around her finger,

598
00:24:52,868 --> 00:24:54,908
and she just... She threw it
on the ground and said no.

599
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:56,539
Or nyet,
'cause she's Russian.

600
00:24:56,677 --> 00:24:59,524
She caught the next plane
out of there. Adios, Kevin.

601
00:24:59,909 --> 00:25:01,632
Your proposal seems
way out of character.

602
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:03,359
Why did you put
so little effort into it?

603
00:25:03,717 --> 00:25:04,666
Greg told me to.

604
00:25:06,181 --> 00:25:07,555
What are you...
Kevin, no, no.

605
00:25:07,813 --> 00:25:09,668
- What are you talking about? I didn't...
- Daddy?

606
00:25:09,796 --> 00:25:10,941
I can't sleep.

607
00:25:11,556 --> 00:25:12,767
Still in diapers.

608
00:25:13,093 --> 00:25:15,460
No, Jack, they're pull-ups.
We're weaning him off diapers.

609
00:25:15,877 --> 00:25:16,825
What's up, man?

610
00:25:16,901 --> 00:25:19,454
I can't stop thinking
about all that blood.

611
00:25:19,525 --> 00:25:21,500
Really? All right, well,
how about I read you a story?

612
00:25:21,572 --> 00:25:22,914
Uncle Kevin!

613
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,257
How you doing, tiger?

614
00:25:24,325 --> 00:25:25,918
- Good.
- Oh!

615
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:26,969
Wow.

616
00:25:27,909 --> 00:25:29,021
Are you having
a hard time sleeping?

617
00:25:29,092 --> 00:25:31,427
- Yeah.
- Oh.

618
00:25:35,045 --> 00:25:36,507
There we go.

619
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,529
Jesus. Henry?

620
00:25:38,277 --> 00:25:39,903
- Are you...
- Shh. He's sleeping.

621
00:25:41,253 --> 00:25:43,293
He's sleeping.
I put him in a still-point.

622
00:25:43,685 --> 00:25:45,027
It's a massage technique

623
00:25:45,093 --> 00:25:47,002
that relaxes
the body by gently

624
00:25:47,076 --> 00:25:49,215
easing the flow of
cerebrospinal fluid.

625
00:25:49,445 --> 00:25:50,852
Yeah. Look at him.

626
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,956
He's gonna wake up
feeling so refreshed.

627
00:25:53,348 --> 00:25:55,836
I've been studying a lot of
Eastern medicine in my down time.

628
00:25:56,645 --> 00:25:58,750
Well, listen, I just came
by to say my hellos,

629
00:25:58,821 --> 00:26:00,250
so I will head on out.

630
00:26:00,357 --> 00:26:01,306
- Good.
- Okay.

631
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,355
Hey, Kev, listen,
do you need a place to stay?

632
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:05,568
No, he doesn't.
You got a place to stay, right?

633
00:26:05,637 --> 00:26:07,131
- And we're pretty full up.
- Not a problem.

634
00:26:07,205 --> 00:26:08,961
I volunteer at a South Side
homeless shelter.

635
00:26:09,029 --> 00:26:10,370
So, I'll probably
stay there

636
00:26:10,437 --> 00:26:11,811
and just work the soup
kitchen line in the morning.

637
00:26:11,877 --> 00:26:13,884
That is so
wonderful, Kevin.

638
00:26:13,956 --> 00:26:15,996
Yeah, it's funny,
I feed them food,

639
00:26:16,069 --> 00:26:18,208
but those vagrants
and drifters feed my soul,

640
00:26:18,693 --> 00:26:20,286
so it works out
pretty good for all of us.

641
00:26:20,901 --> 00:26:22,559
Perfect.
We always need extra hands,

642
00:26:22,629 --> 00:26:24,254
if you guys wanna
come on down tomorrow...

643
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,722
Actually, Greg and I are
taking a tour of this place called

644
00:26:26,788 --> 00:26:28,414
the Early Human
School tomorrow.

645
00:26:28,485 --> 00:26:29,565
- But maybe after...
- You're kidding me,

646
00:26:29,668 --> 00:26:30,715
the Early Human School?

647
00:26:31,109 --> 00:26:32,057
Right.

648
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:33,791
My investment group
handles their endowment fund.

649
00:26:33,861 --> 00:26:35,617
In fact,
the director, Prudence,

650
00:26:35,684 --> 00:26:37,375
is a dear friend
and ex-lover of mine.

651
00:26:38,405 --> 00:26:39,812
I'm gonna put in
a good word for you.

652
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,883
That would be great,
wouldn't it?

653
00:26:42,117 --> 00:26:43,065
Oh, of course.

654
00:26:43,141 --> 00:26:45,694
Or not. I mean, you know, she's an
ex-lover, I think that'd be awkward.

655
00:26:45,829 --> 00:26:48,447
No, nonsense. I'm on great
terms with all my ex-lovers.

656
00:26:49,445 --> 00:26:51,168
- Thanks.
- Sure.

657
00:26:52,004 --> 00:26:55,387
Okay. All right, well,
you know, whatever feels right.

658
00:26:55,461 --> 00:26:58,144
After the tour, Greg, I was hoping
you'd show us your new house.

659
00:26:58,213 --> 00:26:59,457
And, Kevin, when you're
done feeding the bums,

660
00:26:59,525 --> 00:27:00,735
why don't you meet us there?

661
00:27:00,804 --> 00:27:02,331
Okay. I'll be there.

662
00:27:02,405 --> 00:27:04,260
You know what, Jack? I still have
some items on the punch list

663
00:27:04,325 --> 00:27:05,307
to go through
with the contractors,

664
00:27:05,381 --> 00:27:07,072
so I'm thinking maybe we
should put it off for a few days.

665
00:27:07,172 --> 00:27:08,928
- Ah, no, let's do it tomorrow.
- Well, I think...

666
00:27:08,997 --> 00:27:10,273
- We'll meet you there at noon, Kevin.
- I don't know.

667
00:27:10,341 --> 00:27:11,835
At noon?
Yeah, all right. Okay.

668
00:27:11,908 --> 00:27:13,435
And we're gonna
get you through this.

669
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:15,614
Anything you need,
you come to me.

670
00:27:15,685 --> 00:27:16,797
Okay. Thanks, J.B.

671
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:18,210
Yeah. Or me.

672
00:27:20,645 --> 00:27:21,660
Okay.

673
00:27:21,733 --> 00:27:23,489
Well, you can come
to either of us.

674
00:27:23,557 --> 00:27:24,702
Yeah, we're here for you.

675
00:27:24,773 --> 00:27:25,885
Thanks.

676
00:27:26,916 --> 00:27:27,898
Careful, yeah.

677
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:33,410
- I feel like crap.
- Yeah.

678
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,649
You're burning up.

679
00:27:34,725 --> 00:27:37,540
Yeah, I must have gotten the
flu the kids had last week.

680
00:27:37,605 --> 00:27:38,619
Oh, my God,
the school tour is today.

681
00:27:38,692 --> 00:27:39,641
Yeah, I know.

682
00:27:39,717 --> 00:27:40,927
Honey, what am I gonna do?

683
00:27:40,997 --> 00:27:42,175
I'll do it. Okay?
I'll handle it.

684
00:27:42,245 --> 00:27:43,193
- Yeah?
- Yeah, and your mom

685
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:44,316
can take the kids
to school.

686
00:27:44,389 --> 00:27:45,796
But what about my dad?

687
00:27:45,989 --> 00:27:47,418
I got it, all right?

688
00:27:51,013 --> 00:27:53,730
I really appreciate your including
me on the school tour, Greg.

689
00:27:53,796 --> 00:27:56,666
Oh, Jack, you are
a trusted advisor.

690
00:27:57,028 --> 00:28:00,411
I mean, your words hit home
about a top-notch education,

691
00:28:00,485 --> 00:28:01,728
getting your
financial house in order.

692
00:28:01,828 --> 00:28:02,372
That's it.

693
00:28:02,441 --> 00:28:04,319
- It's all about the kids, right?
- That's it.

694
00:28:04,389 --> 00:28:05,567
The next generation.

695
00:28:05,637 --> 00:28:06,782
I'm glad to
hear you say that.

696
00:28:07,077 --> 00:28:08,539
Makes me feel that
I've chosen wisely.

697
00:28:09,572 --> 00:28:11,427
Of course, children change
everything in a marriage,

698
00:28:11,492 --> 00:28:12,987
and that was the issue
with Debbie and Bob.

699
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,613
They stopped finding time for each
other once LJ came into their lives,

700
00:28:15,684 --> 00:28:17,888
so Bob sought sexual
fulfillment outside the marriage.

701
00:28:17,956 --> 00:28:18,905
Mmm.

702
00:28:19,077 --> 00:28:20,899
- Dr. Bob.
- Dr. Bob.

703
00:28:20,997 --> 00:28:22,371
He really disappointed me.

704
00:28:22,917 --> 00:28:26,430
I'll tell you something. I'd like to
really teach that bastard a lesson.

705
00:28:27,204 --> 00:28:28,633
I happen to have
his new address.

706
00:28:28,772 --> 00:28:30,267
Perhaps you and I should
sneak in there one night

707
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,544
and plant a tiny explosive
device in the stove.

708
00:28:32,612 --> 00:28:34,401
Make it look like a gas leak.

709
00:28:37,252 --> 00:28:38,529
Yeah. Yeah.

710
00:28:38,724 --> 00:28:40,579
Or we could,
you know, maybe

711
00:28:40,644 --> 00:28:43,808
find some less criminal way
of teaching him a lesson.

712
00:28:43,876 --> 00:28:45,884
You know, still get him.

713
00:28:46,469 --> 00:28:47,614
I'm only joking, Greg.

714
00:28:47,685 --> 00:28:48,895
Okay.

715
00:28:49,765 --> 00:28:50,713
But it would be fun.

716
00:28:50,788 --> 00:28:51,737
Yeah, oh,
it would be great.

717
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,130
I'm hoping that you and Pam are
still finding time for each other.

718
00:28:56,004 --> 00:28:57,019
Oh, yeah.

719
00:28:57,093 --> 00:28:58,849
Yeah, are you kidding?
Yeah, no, no, we're great, we're...

720
00:28:58,949 --> 00:28:59,897
Good.

721
00:28:59,973 --> 00:29:01,183
I mean, you know,
it's not easy.

722
00:29:01,252 --> 00:29:02,365
You got to work
at it, but...

723
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,609
Are you still physically
attracted to my daughter, Greg?

724
00:29:04,965 --> 00:29:09,602
To Pam? Are you kidding? Yes. Jack,
there's never been a problem with that.

725
00:29:10,052 --> 00:29:13,348
Even after her body's endured the
hellish ordeal of birthing twins?

726
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:18,688
Yes. Even after that. It's still... It's
all good. It's all good under the hood.

727
00:29:20,804 --> 00:29:22,211
That's disgusting.

728
00:29:31,749 --> 00:29:33,407
Welcome, parents.

729
00:29:34,373 --> 00:29:37,569
I'm Prudence Simmons,
director of the Early Human School.

730
00:29:38,757 --> 00:29:42,106
And at E.H.S., we know.

731
00:29:43,236 --> 00:29:47,164
We know that no two
early humans are alike.

732
00:29:47,781 --> 00:29:51,611
So why should their educational
experiences be identical? Right?

733
00:29:52,325 --> 00:29:53,535
Makes sense.

734
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:57,405
It's not about
the 99.8% of graduates

735
00:29:57,477 --> 00:29:59,037
that go on to the best
secondary schools.

736
00:29:59,781 --> 00:30:01,025
Wow, impressive.

737
00:30:01,093 --> 00:30:02,041
Yeah.

738
00:30:04,453 --> 00:30:06,460
That guy's really been
hitting the Bowflex, huh?

739
00:30:06,532 --> 00:30:07,481
What?

740
00:30:07,652 --> 00:30:10,271
It's not the overwhelming
number of Early Human alumni

741
00:30:10,597 --> 00:30:15,386
that become civic leaders,
CEOs of Fortune 500 companies. No.

742
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:20,131
What's important to us is
that they become themselves.

743
00:30:20,324 --> 00:30:23,521
Please welcome
the Early Human Tumblers!

744
00:30:28,612 --> 00:30:29,561
Whoo!

745
00:30:30,757 --> 00:30:32,001
Kids are really good.

746
00:30:32,069 --> 00:30:33,792
I like what I'm seeing
from this place.

747
00:30:33,861 --> 00:30:35,585
Yeah. And I'm sure it
doesn't come cheap.

748
00:30:36,069 --> 00:30:37,116
Mmm-mmm.

749
00:30:37,541 --> 00:30:38,621
You think you can swing it?

750
00:30:38,693 --> 00:30:39,641
Mmm-hmm.

751
00:30:40,069 --> 00:30:42,305
Yeah. Yeah,
I got it covered.

752
00:30:42,789 --> 00:30:44,447
And, you know,

753
00:30:44,517 --> 00:30:46,339
if it's not covered right now,
it will be covered.

754
00:30:46,629 --> 00:30:49,050
It's one of those things
that you cover it.

755
00:30:49,124 --> 00:30:50,269
Do you have the money
or not, Greg?

756
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,617
New friends, hello!

757
00:30:51,685 --> 00:30:52,732
Hi.

758
00:30:52,805 --> 00:30:53,787
Hi, I'm Prudence. Greg?

759
00:30:53,861 --> 00:30:54,809
Greg. How are you?

760
00:30:54,884 --> 00:30:56,029
- Jack?
- Jack Byrnes.

761
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:59,329
So, Jack and Greg,
tell me what path you've chosen.

762
00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:03,101
How do you make a "living"?

763
00:31:03,268 --> 00:31:05,439
Oh, okay, well,
I'm a nurse.

764
00:31:05,796 --> 00:31:06,778
Oh.

765
00:31:07,268 --> 00:31:08,217
He's being modest.

766
00:31:08,293 --> 00:31:10,878
He's actually the department
manager of the medical-surgical unit

767
00:31:10,948 --> 00:31:14,526
at Chicago Memorial
and I am a retired florist.

768
00:31:14,852 --> 00:31:17,089
What a combination,
a nurse and a florist?

769
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:18,785
How great.

770
00:31:18,853 --> 00:31:20,740
May I ask how long you've
been in each other's lives?

771
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,009
Oh, I'd say... Well, it's about
eight years, hasn't it been?

772
00:31:23,076 --> 00:31:24,254
Yeah, eight years.

773
00:31:24,485 --> 00:31:25,663
- I'd say eight years.
- Really?

774
00:31:25,733 --> 00:31:26,813
Yeah, yeah.
Eight great years. Yeah.

775
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,095
Eight great years.

776
00:31:28,165 --> 00:31:29,758
Well, it started out
a little rocky.

777
00:31:29,925 --> 00:31:31,234
We've had our moments.

778
00:31:31,301 --> 00:31:32,795
Yes, but then
we figured it out.

779
00:31:33,381 --> 00:31:34,941
You seem like
a wonderful couple.

780
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,239
- No, no, no. We're not homosexuals.
- Yeah, no.

781
00:31:38,309 --> 00:31:39,999
No, no. No, no, no, no,
this is my son-in-law.

782
00:31:41,061 --> 00:31:42,206
Yeah, yeah,
no, no, no, no.

783
00:31:42,725 --> 00:31:46,587
However, if you're looking to
fill a quota, we can be flexible.

784
00:31:47,428 --> 00:31:49,949
Okay, that's an
interesting joke,

785
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,835
but I appreciate levity in a
moment of misunderstanding,

786
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,242
so thank you, Greg.

787
00:31:54,725 --> 00:31:55,870
I will say, Jack,
I hope I didn't offend you.

788
00:31:55,941 --> 00:31:57,086
Oh. No, no.

789
00:31:57,157 --> 00:31:58,105
Really?

790
00:31:58,181 --> 00:32:01,148
No. I mean, I'm not gay
myself, but if I were gay,

791
00:32:01,221 --> 00:32:04,898
I would certainly be proud to
choose a life partner like Gay Focker.

792
00:32:05,253 --> 00:32:06,911
And that's
his actual name.

793
00:32:07,557 --> 00:32:08,505
Oh.

794
00:32:09,156 --> 00:32:12,539
It is. Well, it's my, Gaylord was my
name when I was a kid and, yeah.

795
00:32:12,804 --> 00:32:15,226
Well, I'll complete
the conversation with that.

796
00:32:15,301 --> 00:32:16,283
Jack.

797
00:32:16,421 --> 00:32:17,697
- Prudence.
- Pleasure.

798
00:32:18,277 --> 00:32:20,065
- Gay. Great.
- Greg.

799
00:32:20,613 --> 00:32:21,857
Change that nametag.

800
00:32:21,988 --> 00:32:23,614
You can call...
It's Greg. Greg is fine.

801
00:32:23,685 --> 00:32:25,278
Why don't we just
stick with the truth?

802
00:32:33,861 --> 00:32:36,763
An original American
Foursquare, Greg, very nice.

803
00:32:36,837 --> 00:32:40,547
Yeah, yeah. It's got rock-solid
bones and, you know, it's...

804
00:32:47,364 --> 00:32:49,274
Hey! There they are.

805
00:32:50,213 --> 00:32:52,068
- Kev-O, that's quite a rental.
- Yeah.

806
00:32:52,133 --> 00:32:53,856
Gustavo, my assistant,
hooked it up.

807
00:32:53,924 --> 00:32:55,779
I guess it's a Tesla
Roadster or something.

808
00:32:56,293 --> 00:32:59,424
Supposedly eco-friendly,
like that 2003 Prius, Greg.

809
00:32:59,492 --> 00:33:00,572
Yeah, you got it.

810
00:33:00,644 --> 00:33:02,138
Wow. It looks great.

811
00:33:02,468 --> 00:33:04,061
Traditional
American Foursquare.

812
00:33:04,132 --> 00:33:05,693
Also known as
a Prairie Box.

813
00:33:05,989 --> 00:33:07,396
- Yeah.
- It's got really good bones.

814
00:33:07,493 --> 00:33:09,086
Good eye, Kev.

815
00:33:10,629 --> 00:33:11,905
Look out for your legs.

816
00:33:13,317 --> 00:33:14,299
That's good.

817
00:33:14,373 --> 00:33:15,321
Randy? Randy,
what is this?

818
00:33:15,877 --> 00:33:18,244
Gregory Focker!

819
00:33:18,628 --> 00:33:19,872
Great to see you.
How you doing, Dad?

820
00:33:19,941 --> 00:33:20,923
Hey.

821
00:33:20,997 --> 00:33:23,201
Randy, what is this? We're
having the party here in two days.

822
00:33:23,461 --> 00:33:24,671
Um...

823
00:33:24,741 --> 00:33:26,115
Refresh my memory, Gregory.

824
00:33:26,597 --> 00:33:29,018
Are you kidding me? Randy,
the twins' birthday party, remember?

825
00:33:29,285 --> 00:33:30,267
Yes, of course!

826
00:33:30,916 --> 00:33:31,865
The issue
we're dealing with is

827
00:33:31,941 --> 00:33:36,131
that we had to excavate 60 feet
of root-infested pipe back here!

828
00:33:36,197 --> 00:33:37,920
So, of course, we ran into
some unexpected costs

829
00:33:37,988 --> 00:33:39,549
along with an obvious delay.

830
00:33:39,621 --> 00:33:42,010
Randy, is this yard gonna be
done or is it not gonna be done?

831
00:33:42,084 --> 00:33:43,459
Jack, I got this.
All right?

832
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:46,785
All Mr. Byrnes is suggesting
is that maybe inadvertently

833
00:33:47,045 --> 00:33:49,794
you're taking advantage
of a gentle, trusting soul

834
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,675
who clearly is an amateur when
it comes to home construction.

835
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,563
- No, Kevin.
- Thank you, Swami Salami.

836
00:33:54,629 --> 00:33:55,905
That's not true at all.

837
00:33:55,972 --> 00:33:57,249
It is true, Greg.
They're ripping you off.

838
00:33:57,317 --> 00:33:59,040
- No, Jack...
- Your plumbing excavators

839
00:33:59,173 --> 00:34:01,060
have been on coffee break
for the past eight minutes,

840
00:34:01,124 --> 00:34:03,994
this senior citizen over here
is unfit for active duty

841
00:34:04,069 --> 00:34:06,370
and your backhoe driver's
halfway through a Sudoku puzzle.

842
00:34:06,501 --> 00:34:07,449
- All right.
- Gregory,

843
00:34:07,525 --> 00:34:10,242
who is this joker
questioning my honor?

844
00:34:10,309 --> 00:34:12,000
Nobody's questioning
your honor, Randy.

845
00:34:12,069 --> 00:34:13,792
I'm 34 years in the trade!

846
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,005
Thirty-four years, huh?

847
00:34:15,076 --> 00:34:18,786
I got to pump, dump and hump
to get that backyard whole again!

848
00:34:18,853 --> 00:34:21,723
Well, I got news for you. You can pump,
dump and hump all you want!

849
00:34:21,796 --> 00:34:23,225
You're sandbagging this
damn job and you know it.

850
00:34:23,301 --> 00:34:24,283
- All right. You know what?
- Jack, Jack, Jack!

851
00:34:24,357 --> 00:34:26,212
- Calm down!
- You're leaving a big hole, you...

852
00:34:26,277 --> 00:34:29,179
Hey, General!
The Japanese surrendered!

853
00:34:29,253 --> 00:34:30,562
- The Japanese surrendered!
- That's it!

854
00:34:30,692 --> 00:34:31,969
What are you talking about?

855
00:34:32,708 --> 00:34:33,723
World War II.

856
00:34:34,149 --> 00:34:36,320
I'll tell you what, Gregor.
I have a timeshare in town.

857
00:34:36,388 --> 00:34:37,566
Why don't we have
the party there?

858
00:34:37,637 --> 00:34:39,262
Beautiful meadow.
It'll be perfect.

859
00:34:39,332 --> 00:34:41,056
No, no, Kevin,
I promised the kids

860
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:42,783
they're gonna have
the party in the yard.

861
00:34:42,853 --> 00:34:46,148
So, guess what? We're gonna
have the party in the yard. Okay?

862
00:34:46,213 --> 00:34:48,187
Soon as our dump truck
driver's back from lunch,

863
00:34:48,261 --> 00:34:49,887
we'll get that out,
bring the backhoe in,

864
00:34:49,957 --> 00:34:51,517
lay down your
base layer of sand.

865
00:34:51,941 --> 00:34:54,145
Wait a minute. You're telling us
that you can't move that rig?

866
00:34:54,373 --> 00:34:55,835
That's a union job, pops.

867
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:57,632
Screw it. I'm gonna
move that truck myself.

868
00:34:57,701 --> 00:34:58,649
No, come on.
No, you know what, Jack?

869
00:34:58,724 --> 00:35:00,001
I'll do it, okay?
You just help me

870
00:35:00,069 --> 00:35:01,563
back it out into the street.
I got it.

871
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,769
Here we go.

872
00:35:04,005 --> 00:35:05,979
All right, start backing
her up. You're all clear.

873
00:35:11,749 --> 00:35:12,861
Coming at you, Jack!

874
00:35:13,061 --> 00:35:14,719
You're doing great,
you're doing great.

875
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:18,046
Hey, look, I'm not in the union,
Randy! I'm backing up the truck!

876
00:35:18,309 --> 00:35:21,658
Come on. Back, back, back.
Doing great. Doing great! Doing great!

877
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:23,427
Whoa! Whoa!

878
00:35:24,421 --> 00:35:25,566
Brake it!

879
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,003
Oh!

880
00:35:27,076 --> 00:35:28,538
You got it!

881
00:35:29,381 --> 00:35:30,690
- We're good.
- Emergency brake!

882
00:35:30,981 --> 00:35:31,929
Got it!

883
00:35:36,805 --> 00:35:39,620
Jack!
Holy shit!

884
00:35:39,685 --> 00:35:40,929
Hang on, I'm with you!

885
00:35:41,093 --> 00:35:42,849
Jack, I'm right here.
Jack, we're gonna get you!

886
00:35:43,621 --> 00:35:44,897
It's gonna be
all right, Jack!

887
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,260
Jack, we're coming!
Hang on, Jack!

888
00:35:47,461 --> 00:35:48,409
I got him!

889
00:35:48,485 --> 00:35:49,434
I got you.

890
00:35:49,764 --> 00:35:52,285
It's Kevin.
I'm right here.

891
00:35:53,477 --> 00:35:55,135
- Thank you, Kevin.
- Save your strength.

892
00:35:55,205 --> 00:35:58,172
Upsy-daisy.
Greg's right here. He's okay.

893
00:35:59,012 --> 00:36:00,092
Yeah, I see him.

894
00:36:01,413 --> 00:36:02,525
Hey, Jack.

895
00:36:03,525 --> 00:36:04,702
Oh, here, it's starting.

896
00:36:04,772 --> 00:36:09,409
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's The Roz Focker Show!

897
00:36:10,724 --> 00:36:15,231
And that means it's time
to sexpress yourself!

898
00:36:16,357 --> 00:36:17,601
Hello, my audience!

899
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,359
Hello, my friends.
Welcome.

900
00:36:20,005 --> 00:36:22,045
Today, what do you think
we're going to talk about?

901
00:36:22,244 --> 00:36:24,154
- Sex!
- Sex. Sex.

902
00:36:24,229 --> 00:36:25,538
Well, what else is she
gonna talk about?

903
00:36:26,084 --> 00:36:27,710
Sex after children.

904
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:29,755
How do you find
time to make love

905
00:36:29,828 --> 00:36:31,290
with young children
in the house?

906
00:36:31,973 --> 00:36:33,915
What do you do
if it's not working?

907
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,129
Do you have an affair?

908
00:36:35,397 --> 00:36:36,607
No!

909
00:36:36,965 --> 00:36:40,161
No, you say?
But Roz Focker says yes!

910
00:36:40,581 --> 00:36:42,654
Yes, you do have an affair!

911
00:36:42,885 --> 00:36:46,146
You have an affair
with your wife!

912
00:36:46,693 --> 00:36:47,838
Oh, Roz!

913
00:36:47,908 --> 00:36:49,250
Think about it, right?

914
00:36:49,317 --> 00:36:52,612
You dress up a little nicer.
You meet at a hotel.

915
00:36:52,868 --> 00:36:54,079
You role play.

916
00:36:54,469 --> 00:37:00,033
There is absolutely no shame in playing
out a fantasy, but with each other!

917
00:37:01,508 --> 00:37:02,588
All right?

918
00:37:03,524 --> 00:37:06,175
Now, he's gonna kill me,

919
00:37:07,012 --> 00:37:11,834
but my own son, who is the
father of two adorable twins,

920
00:37:12,932 --> 00:37:14,209
he has issues
in this department.

921
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,951
He's busy at work.
She's busy at home.

922
00:37:18,053 --> 00:37:20,736
Their intimacy numbers are down.
They're not connecting.

923
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,297
And what do you do?

924
00:37:23,588 --> 00:37:25,977
- It's called Sustengo.
- Sustengo?

925
00:37:26,053 --> 00:37:27,963
I got to say, that sounds
pretty cheesy, Greg.

926
00:37:28,036 --> 00:37:31,135
Yeah, well, I'm looking at
these Randy Weir bills, okay.

927
00:37:31,205 --> 00:37:32,318
And we could definitely
use the money.

928
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:34,175
And do me a favor.
Don't tell your dad about this, okay?

929
00:37:34,244 --> 00:37:35,488
My dad? Why?

930
00:37:35,556 --> 00:37:37,182
Just 'cause
he's been all into

931
00:37:37,349 --> 00:37:39,999
me having my financial
house in order or whatever,

932
00:37:40,069 --> 00:37:41,661
- and I just don't want to worry him.
- All right, fine.

933
00:37:41,989 --> 00:37:43,647
I won't say anything because
he's already pretty upset

934
00:37:43,717 --> 00:37:45,659
about you trying to bury
him alive.

935
00:37:45,893 --> 00:37:46,973
Honey, it was an accident.

936
00:37:47,205 --> 00:37:48,187
Superstar!

937
00:37:48,485 --> 00:37:49,630
Hey. Hey, can you
hang on a second?

938
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:50,650
Okay.

939
00:37:50,916 --> 00:37:52,738
I am so stoked
you changed your mind.

940
00:37:52,965 --> 00:37:55,812
You are going to rock
those urologists tonight.

941
00:37:55,876 --> 00:37:57,371
Awesome.
That's always been a goal of mine.

942
00:37:57,669 --> 00:37:59,644
So, I'll see you
at 8:00 at the Hilton?

943
00:37:59,716 --> 00:38:00,665
Yes.

944
00:38:00,741 --> 00:38:02,628
- And wear a suit.
- Wear a suit, got it.

945
00:38:02,692 --> 00:38:04,154
- Knuckles?
- Knuckles.

946
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:05,273
Okay, bye.

947
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:07,132
- Hey.
- Hello.

948
00:38:07,205 --> 00:38:08,634
Knuckles? Who was that?

949
00:38:08,708 --> 00:38:10,301
That certainly
didn't sound like Kristen.

950
00:38:10,468 --> 00:38:12,475
No, no.
That was the drug rep.

951
00:38:12,773 --> 00:38:14,595
- Andi?
- Yeah, Andi.

952
00:38:15,076 --> 00:38:16,025
What does she look like?

953
00:38:16,421 --> 00:38:18,461
She's like a...
No, she's, like, an ex-nurse.

954
00:38:18,533 --> 00:38:19,678
You wouldn't pick her
out of a lineup.

955
00:38:19,876 --> 00:38:21,054
Yeah, I know that
you're doing this for us,

956
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:23,743
but the idea of you and
some woman named Andi

957
00:38:23,812 --> 00:38:26,780
selling boner medicine at a hotel,
it really kind of icks me out.

958
00:38:27,237 --> 00:38:29,026
Honey, there's nothing
to be icked out about.

959
00:38:29,093 --> 00:38:30,653
Okay, fine.

960
00:38:30,884 --> 00:38:32,772
- I love you.
- I love you, too, honey. Bye.

961
00:38:32,837 --> 00:38:33,982
Okay, bye.

962
00:38:40,197 --> 00:38:41,757
So, how come you're
not talking to Daddy?

963
00:38:41,956 --> 00:38:43,331
'Cause he said
you were cuckoo.

964
00:38:44,101 --> 00:38:45,115
He said I was cuckoo?

965
00:38:45,444 --> 00:38:46,393
Mmm-hmm.

966
00:38:46,789 --> 00:38:48,382
Well, we'll have
to discuss that.

967
00:38:48,837 --> 00:38:49,785
Yeah.

968
00:38:50,309 --> 00:38:51,421
But what about
Mommy and Daddy?

969
00:38:51,493 --> 00:38:52,671
Is everything okay
with them?

970
00:38:53,765 --> 00:38:55,456
I guess
they fight sometimes.

971
00:38:55,525 --> 00:38:57,597
Mmm-hmm. And what do
they fight about?

972
00:38:57,957 --> 00:38:58,939
Um...

973
00:38:59,013 --> 00:39:02,941
Like Mommy got mad at Daddy because
he was going to the hotel with Andi.

974
00:39:03,013 --> 00:39:03,962
Andi?

975
00:39:06,404 --> 00:39:07,386
Who's Andi?

976
00:39:07,493 --> 00:39:10,308
I can't say because I'm
not supposed to be spying.

977
00:39:10,533 --> 00:39:13,402
Like I always tell you,
there's nothing wrong with spying

978
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,811
as long as you
suspect foul play.

979
00:39:16,837 --> 00:39:18,178
So, who's Andi?

980
00:39:18,501 --> 00:39:20,835
Andi gives Daddy
his boners.

981
00:39:22,437 --> 00:39:23,614
His what?

982
00:39:24,036 --> 00:39:26,851
Andi gives Daddy his boners.

983
00:39:27,428 --> 00:39:28,377
Uh-huh.

984
00:39:30,437 --> 00:39:31,484
Hey, guys!

985
00:39:31,589 --> 00:39:32,865
- Hey, Greg.
- How was your day?

986
00:39:32,932 --> 00:39:34,459
- Yeah.
- Great.

987
00:39:35,877 --> 00:39:36,825
Hey.

988
00:39:37,157 --> 00:39:38,105
How about you, Sam?

989
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:41,024
What? Come on,
say something to me.

990
00:39:41,093 --> 00:39:42,238
No! I won't!

991
00:39:42,309 --> 00:39:44,196
Ah! You just did.

992
00:39:45,989 --> 00:39:47,265
- Hey, Greg?
- Yeah.

993
00:39:47,492 --> 00:39:48,802
I'm not so sure

994
00:39:48,869 --> 00:39:51,105
using chicanery and
subterfuge on your daughter

995
00:39:51,172 --> 00:39:53,180
is the best way to get her
to communicate with you.

996
00:39:53,285 --> 00:39:55,390
No, no, no. That's not
chicanery and subterfuge.

997
00:39:55,589 --> 00:39:57,018
For whatever it's worth.

998
00:39:58,021 --> 00:39:59,101
Worth a lot. Thank you.

999
00:39:59,269 --> 00:40:01,057
And I will
see you later, okay?

1000
00:40:01,124 --> 00:40:04,092
I got roped into this hospital
administration dinner thing tonight, so...

1001
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,631
- Work function?
- Yeah.

1002
00:40:05,765 --> 00:40:08,732
It's the price of being
in charge of the unit, so...

1003
00:40:09,316 --> 00:40:10,723
I see.
That last minute, huh?

1004
00:40:10,789 --> 00:40:11,771
Yeah.

1005
00:40:11,844 --> 00:40:14,779
Department head called so I
gotta do a little face time and...

1006
00:40:15,141 --> 00:40:16,351
- Have fun.
- Okay.

1007
00:40:24,357 --> 00:40:25,306
Hmm.

1008
00:40:48,772 --> 00:40:49,721
Jack?

1009
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:51,130
Jack!

1010
00:40:51,877 --> 00:40:52,825
Is that you?

1011
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,595
- Greg.
- What are you doing out here?

1012
00:40:54,821 --> 00:40:56,992
Just picking up some
milk for the morning.

1013
00:40:57,316 --> 00:40:58,745
- You looking for a market?
- Yeah.

1014
00:40:59,045 --> 00:41:00,539
Okay, 'cause there's one
right across from the house.

1015
00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:02,138
Oh, is there?
I didn't know that.

1016
00:41:02,212 --> 00:41:03,805
Just take a left
on Lincoln. Right there.

1017
00:41:03,973 --> 00:41:05,053
- Thanks, Greg.
- Okay.

1018
00:41:05,125 --> 00:41:06,237
See you later.
Okay.

1019
00:41:53,252 --> 00:41:54,201
Excuse me.

1020
00:41:57,733 --> 00:41:58,682
Hey!

1021
00:42:01,861 --> 00:42:02,809
Greg.

1022
00:42:03,044 --> 00:42:05,281
Hey, man.
You following me?

1023
00:42:05,989 --> 00:42:07,647
Following you?
Why would I be following you?

1024
00:42:07,717 --> 00:42:09,277
No, I'm just
looking for milk.

1025
00:42:10,565 --> 00:42:14,013
Okay. 'Cause, remember,
I mentioned out on the street there,

1026
00:42:14,085 --> 00:42:15,546
there's a store
right in the neighborhood.

1027
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,504
True, but Dina likes
the organic stuff

1028
00:42:17,573 --> 00:42:19,940
and I heard there was a
natural food market downtown.

1029
00:42:20,324 --> 00:42:23,641
Amazing, you going all this
way just for a carton of milk.

1030
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,473
You know what?
You should get off here.

1031
00:42:28,549 --> 00:42:30,785
There's a really great
natural foods market

1032
00:42:30,853 --> 00:42:32,609
about two blocks
south of the station.

1033
00:42:33,189 --> 00:42:34,137
Oh.

1034
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,682
Have a good night, Jack.

1035
00:42:42,949 --> 00:42:44,061
You, too, Greg.

1036
00:43:00,485 --> 00:43:01,434
Hey.

1037
00:43:01,764 --> 00:43:03,325
Oh! Hey.

1038
00:43:03,909 --> 00:43:04,956
Superstar!

1039
00:43:07,972 --> 00:43:10,427
Everything cool?
You seem a little edgy.

1040
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:13,411
No, I'm good.
It's just my in-laws are in town, so...

1041
00:43:13,828 --> 00:43:15,072
Anyway, I went over
the drug info

1042
00:43:15,141 --> 00:43:16,635
and I think I got the
science down pretty well.

1043
00:43:16,708 --> 00:43:19,229
Oh, no, Greg. These doctors
don't care about that stuff.

1044
00:43:19,492 --> 00:43:23,169
If you want to sell a drug like Sustengo,
you have to make it personal.

1045
00:43:24,036 --> 00:43:25,465
Do you know any
sexually frustrated

1046
00:43:25,541 --> 00:43:27,035
old dudes with
a heart condition?

1047
00:43:46,532 --> 00:43:48,125
I didn't hear you come in.

1048
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:51,457
What kept you so long?

1049
00:43:52,644 --> 00:43:55,263
I just got a little bit lost.
Everyone asleep?

1050
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:56,281
Yeah.

1051
00:43:56,549 --> 00:43:58,491
We've got
the house to ourselves.

1052
00:43:59,397 --> 00:44:04,961
I'm so happy that you
got away from your wife.

1053
00:44:06,084 --> 00:44:07,491
Excuse me?

1054
00:44:07,557 --> 00:44:09,247
She's been
very suspicious lately.

1055
00:44:09,733 --> 00:44:12,416
Quick, quick, quick.
We only have an hour.

1056
00:44:14,661 --> 00:44:16,352
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

1057
00:44:16,421 --> 00:44:18,657
Jack, come on.
You've gotta play along.

1058
00:44:18,725 --> 00:44:21,539
Roz Focker said we have to
have an affair with each other.

1059
00:44:21,605 --> 00:44:23,198
I'm role playing.

1060
00:44:23,269 --> 00:44:24,414
Right, right, right.
I understand.

1061
00:44:24,485 --> 00:44:28,096
I just have a bit of a headache,
sweetheart, tonight.

1062
00:44:28,229 --> 00:44:31,524
I know. You've had that
worried look on your face all day.

1063
00:44:31,717 --> 00:44:35,230
I promise you, the Focker
family is going to be fine.

1064
00:44:35,653 --> 00:44:36,929
Now, come on.

1065
00:44:37,189 --> 00:44:39,098
Before my husband
comes home.

1066
00:44:39,973 --> 00:44:43,104
Then, we'd better hurry, my illicit lover.
Let me just brush my teeth.

1067
00:44:43,172 --> 00:44:44,416
Ooh.

1068
00:44:53,061 --> 00:44:55,614
Your father-in-law did not really
put you in a lie detector machine.

1069
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:57,213
No, that's true.

1070
00:44:57,285 --> 00:44:58,267
That's incredible!

1071
00:44:59,013 --> 00:45:01,763
Jesus Christ, I thought
my wife's father was bad.

1072
00:45:01,829 --> 00:45:02,843
That was
a great speech, nurse.

1073
00:45:03,365 --> 00:45:04,380
Thank you.

1074
00:45:04,453 --> 00:45:05,435
And hey,
"I'm staring at you".

1075
00:45:07,461 --> 00:45:10,178
It was "I'm watching you", but
that's what he did, yes. Thank you.

1076
00:45:10,596 --> 00:45:12,352
You killed it tonight.

1077
00:45:12,772 --> 00:45:15,227
Those stories about your
family were hilarious.

1078
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,089
Thank you.
So, I should be getting going.

1079
00:45:17,253 --> 00:45:19,741
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You're my fiancé.

1080
00:45:19,844 --> 00:45:21,273
Hey, gorgeous.

1081
00:45:21,349 --> 00:45:23,771
Hello, Dr. Ballard.
So nice to see you.

1082
00:45:23,844 --> 00:45:27,227
Hey, can I get you 200cc's
of anything you want, stat?

1083
00:45:28,005 --> 00:45:31,201
Only if you can buy a drink
for my fiancé as well.

1084
00:45:32,101 --> 00:45:33,661
Didn't know
you were engaged.

1085
00:45:33,829 --> 00:45:35,804
Can you take a picture
for us for my scrapbook?

1086
00:45:35,877 --> 00:45:37,567
You know what? You don't...
He doesn't have to do that.

1087
00:45:37,636 --> 00:45:38,618
Yeah, it's for
our scrapbook.

1088
00:45:38,692 --> 00:45:40,602
No, you know what, bro?
I'm cool like that. I'll do that.

1089
00:45:40,677 --> 00:45:42,138
You are such a doll.

1090
00:45:42,405 --> 00:45:43,452
Here we go.

1091
00:45:44,133 --> 00:45:45,377
- One, two, three.
- Whoa!

1092
00:45:46,532 --> 00:45:47,481
Best picture ever.

1093
00:45:48,357 --> 00:45:50,495
You look great and you have,
like, a red-eye problem.

1094
00:45:50,724 --> 00:45:51,837
I'll see you later, babe.

1095
00:45:51,909 --> 00:45:54,048
I cannot believe
I ever slept with that guy.

1096
00:45:54,245 --> 00:45:55,227
Yeah, right.

1097
00:45:55,301 --> 00:45:56,479
No, seriously, I did.

1098
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:58,879
At a convention
in Milwaukee last summer.

1099
00:45:58,948 --> 00:46:02,145
We were, like, drinking
tequila, doing rum chasers.

1100
00:46:02,852 --> 00:46:04,347
Always a bad idea, right?

1101
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:05,403
Yeah.

1102
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:07,491
Can you get me a margarita
on the rocks, no salt?

1103
00:46:08,964 --> 00:46:10,371
- You know what...
- I'm gonna run to the restroom.

1104
00:46:10,437 --> 00:46:11,419
Gosh. You know what...

1105
00:46:11,492 --> 00:46:12,441
All right, cool.
You're the best.

1106
00:46:13,029 --> 00:46:14,589
- All right?
- All right. All right, okay.

1107
00:46:15,653 --> 00:46:19,362
Hi. Can I get a club soda and a
margarita on the rocks with no salt?

1108
00:46:19,845 --> 00:46:20,827
Thanks.

1109
00:46:21,188 --> 00:46:22,465
Night out
on the town, Focker?

1110
00:46:23,812 --> 00:46:25,274
- Dr. Bob.
- Hey, man!

1111
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:26,297
What are you doing here?

1112
00:46:26,373 --> 00:46:28,348
I'm here for the convention.
What about you?

1113
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:31,642
Doing some work for Pfosten
as a medical expert.

1114
00:46:32,773 --> 00:46:33,721
But you're a nurse.

1115
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:37,121
You know what? I don't really
have anything to say to you.

1116
00:46:37,573 --> 00:46:41,250
Okay, I get it, Greg.
I screwed up.

1117
00:46:41,829 --> 00:46:44,131
But the pressure of being in
that family finally got to me.

1118
00:46:44,261 --> 00:46:46,170
What are you talking about?
You were his golden boy.

1119
00:46:46,341 --> 00:46:47,835
More like his golden bitch.

1120
00:46:48,068 --> 00:46:50,752
He wanted Deb and me to get
married in Oyster Bay. Done.

1121
00:46:51,044 --> 00:46:53,019
Can we name our baby
after him? "You got it, Jack."

1122
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:55,617
And he gives me this
whole spiel, right,

1123
00:46:55,685 --> 00:46:57,856
about how I'm next in line
to his throne.

1124
00:46:58,693 --> 00:47:01,246
He came up with this
name for me, the Bobfather.

1125
00:47:04,165 --> 00:47:06,434
Really? He said that to you?

1126
00:47:08,676 --> 00:47:10,170
He pulled the same shit
on you, didn't he?

1127
00:47:10,565 --> 00:47:14,242
In that family, we're all just
hamsters on Jack Byrnes' little wheel.

1128
00:47:14,309 --> 00:47:17,091
His Circus of Trust,
or whatever he calls it.

1129
00:47:17,765 --> 00:47:18,878
Circle of Trust.

1130
00:47:18,949 --> 00:47:21,120
I had no idea how deep I
was in until I stepped away.

1131
00:47:21,189 --> 00:47:22,137
And I'll
tell you something,

1132
00:47:22,213 --> 00:47:25,028
once I got off the treadmill,
I've never been happier.

1133
00:47:26,053 --> 00:47:27,613
Yeah, well, I think
I got it under control.

1134
00:47:40,964 --> 00:47:41,913
Hello, Greg.

1135
00:47:43,621 --> 00:47:44,569
Hey.

1136
00:47:45,253 --> 00:47:46,530
Hey, Jack.

1137
00:47:47,205 --> 00:47:49,114
You mind explaining this?

1138
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:52,249
What is that? Oh.

1139
00:47:53,157 --> 00:47:54,750
Sustengo. Yeah, that's...
You know.

1140
00:47:55,333 --> 00:47:57,537
These drug companies,
they give me all these free samples.

1141
00:47:58,181 --> 00:47:59,129
Is that it?

1142
00:48:00,357 --> 00:48:01,634
Or do you need
to use this

1143
00:48:01,701 --> 00:48:03,741
because you're no longer
sexually attracted to Pam?

1144
00:48:04,612 --> 00:48:08,060
You know what, Jack?
That's ridiculous.

1145
00:48:08,133 --> 00:48:09,245
Really. You know what?

1146
00:48:09,316 --> 00:48:11,455
I'm not even gonna go
there with you. This is...

1147
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:14,653
Have a good night, all right?
I'm gonna go sleep.

1148
00:48:14,757 --> 00:48:16,666
Don't walk away
from me, Focker.

1149
00:48:20,932 --> 00:48:22,361
Jack, is everything okay
down there?

1150
00:48:22,917 --> 00:48:23,964
Everything's fine.

1151
00:48:24,037 --> 00:48:26,852
Okay. All right. 'Cause you
seem to have a little, I mean...

1152
00:48:26,917 --> 00:48:29,186
I know what I have, Greg, and I'm
not concerned about that right now.

1153
00:48:29,253 --> 00:48:31,162
Right now, what I want
from you is the truth.

1154
00:48:32,804 --> 00:48:36,666
Jack, did you take
one of those pills?

1155
00:48:36,996 --> 00:48:38,622
Well, I was
highly preoccupied

1156
00:48:38,693 --> 00:48:39,707
and Dina wanted
to make love,

1157
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:42,115
and the label clearly states
that it's safe for heart patients.

1158
00:48:42,181 --> 00:48:43,610
Yes, but you need
a prescription

1159
00:48:43,685 --> 00:48:45,627
after you've had
a thorough examination.

1160
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:48,089
How long have you had that...
The situation for?

1161
00:48:48,901 --> 00:48:49,948
Stop avoiding the question.

1162
00:48:50,021 --> 00:48:51,068
I'm not avoiding
the question.

1163
00:48:51,141 --> 00:48:52,635
If you've had that
for more than four hours,

1164
00:48:52,708 --> 00:48:55,643
you could bust a capillary and
have serious permanent damage.

1165
00:48:55,717 --> 00:48:56,894
How long
have you had it?

1166
00:48:56,964 --> 00:48:58,371
Been a little longer
than four hours.

1167
00:48:58,437 --> 00:48:59,516
How long?

1168
00:48:59,588 --> 00:49:00,865
Maybe about five and a half.

1169
00:49:01,541 --> 00:49:03,134
Jack, you got to get
to an ER right now

1170
00:49:03,205 --> 00:49:04,896
and get a shot of adrenaline
to counteract that drug.

1171
00:49:04,965 --> 00:49:06,820
You're a nurse. Don't you have
that kind of stuff in the house?

1172
00:49:06,885 --> 00:49:07,997
Yeah, I have an Epi kit,

1173
00:49:08,068 --> 00:49:09,661
but I'm not gonna give you
a shot there, okay?

1174
00:49:09,733 --> 00:49:12,100
Focker, there is no way I'm going
to an ER room with this thing.

1175
00:49:12,164 --> 00:49:14,106
Now you need to stick me
and you need to stick me now!

1176
00:49:14,181 --> 00:49:15,228
I'm having a dick attack!
Stick me!

1177
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:18,366
Shh.
Just relax. Okay.

1178
00:49:18,436 --> 00:49:19,418
I'll get the needle.

1179
00:49:24,325 --> 00:49:28,286
All right. I need you
to drop your pants.

1180
00:49:29,188 --> 00:49:31,806
What kind of sick drug are
you dealing to your patients?

1181
00:49:31,876 --> 00:49:33,764
Jack, I told you,
I took home some samples.

1182
00:49:34,181 --> 00:49:35,457
All right?
Maybe read the label

1183
00:49:35,525 --> 00:49:37,215
before you just pick up
a drug and eat it.

1184
00:49:37,284 --> 00:49:38,266
Let's just do it.

1185
00:49:39,717 --> 00:49:41,342
I'm gonna administer the
shot on the count of three.

1186
00:49:42,436 --> 00:49:43,963
Just... All right?

1187
00:49:46,565 --> 00:49:47,972
Okay. Just...

1188
00:49:48,036 --> 00:49:49,084
It's...

1189
00:49:49,156 --> 00:49:50,171
Your hands are cold.

1190
00:49:50,245 --> 00:49:51,903
I'm sorry.
It's a bit...

1191
00:49:51,973 --> 00:49:53,118
Okay.

1192
00:49:54,756 --> 00:49:55,901
One,

1193
00:49:57,317 --> 00:49:58,397
two,

1194
00:49:59,012 --> 00:50:00,060
three.

1195
00:50:00,133 --> 00:50:02,467
Focker!

1196
00:50:04,837 --> 00:50:06,047
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, shit!

1197
00:50:10,213 --> 00:50:11,839
Wait, what's going on?
What happened?

1198
00:50:11,909 --> 00:50:14,014
Everything's fine.
Henry had a little nightmare,

1199
00:50:14,085 --> 00:50:15,579
but Greg's got him
settled down, okay.

1200
00:50:15,653 --> 00:50:17,475
No, no, Jack, I thought I
heard you screaming, too.

1201
00:50:17,541 --> 00:50:19,330
No, you didn't.
It was all Henry.

1202
00:50:19,397 --> 00:50:20,607
- Well, let me go check on him...
- Oh, no, no, no.

1203
00:50:20,676 --> 00:50:22,237
- ...and make sure he's okay.
- You guys go to sleep.

1204
00:50:22,309 --> 00:50:23,934
Everything's under control.

1205
00:50:28,356 --> 00:50:30,364
Could you and Dad
keep it down, please?

1206
00:50:31,396 --> 00:50:34,560
Here's Sirius Black.
Here's Orange Ninja, okay?

1207
00:50:35,269 --> 00:50:36,676
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1208
00:50:36,741 --> 00:50:38,083
- Greg?
- Yeah.

1209
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:40,507
- How's he doing?
- He's all right.

1210
00:50:40,581 --> 00:50:42,883
You know, he's
a little shaken up, but...

1211
00:50:42,949 --> 00:50:45,699
Greg, I was involved in
some covert CIA-sponsored

1212
00:50:45,765 --> 00:50:47,870
mind-altering techniques
back in the '70s.

1213
00:50:47,941 --> 00:50:49,534
I'd like a few minutes
alone with him

1214
00:50:49,605 --> 00:50:51,677
just to erase what
he saw from his memory.

1215
00:50:52,004 --> 00:50:53,946
You're not gonna erase
my son's memory.

1216
00:50:54,021 --> 00:50:57,534
Greg, he saw his father inject a
needle into his grandfather's penis.

1217
00:50:57,605 --> 00:51:01,249
He already has issues. That's
something he might never recover from.

1218
00:51:01,317 --> 00:51:03,356
I'll handle it, okay?
All right?

1219
00:51:03,428 --> 00:51:04,377
Okay, thank you.

1220
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:08,959
Hey, buddy.

1221
00:51:09,028 --> 00:51:12,705
So, you know how sometimes
you need help when you...

1222
00:51:13,892 --> 00:51:15,419
- When you make a wee-wee?
- Yeah.

1223
00:51:15,493 --> 00:51:17,860
Well, when you get to be
Grandpa Jack's age,

1224
00:51:17,924 --> 00:51:20,445
sometimes you need help
making a wee-wee, too.

1225
00:51:20,517 --> 00:51:21,629
So that's what you
saw me doing.

1226
00:51:21,701 --> 00:51:24,451
I was helping Grandpa Jack
because he's old.

1227
00:51:25,989 --> 00:51:27,876
Well, why did
he scream so loud?

1228
00:51:28,613 --> 00:51:31,744
He wasn't screaming. He was
celebrating, he was just so happy.

1229
00:51:31,813 --> 00:51:36,898
He was, like, "Oh, Focker. Thanks
for helping me make a wee-wee."

1230
00:51:37,476 --> 00:51:39,549
He just... He was so happy.
Right, right?

1231
00:51:39,621 --> 00:51:40,733
Right, Greg.

1232
00:51:40,805 --> 00:51:42,398
- Yeah.
- Understand?

1233
00:51:42,692 --> 00:51:44,099
- I think so.
- Good.

1234
00:51:48,421 --> 00:51:50,941
Don't think this incident
is distracting me, Focker.

1235
00:51:51,013 --> 00:51:53,697
I know you're up to
something and I'm watching you.

1236
00:51:54,404 --> 00:51:57,404
Well, guess what?
I have eyes, too.

1237
00:51:57,477 --> 00:52:01,885
So, I'll be watching you,
watching me.

1238
00:52:02,565 --> 00:52:03,809
- Okay.
- All right?

1239
00:52:03,877 --> 00:52:05,054
- Fair enough.
- Good.

1240
00:52:05,124 --> 00:52:06,499
So we just watch
each other, all right?

1241
00:52:06,565 --> 00:52:07,874
Okay, okay.

1242
00:52:14,885 --> 00:52:16,030
I'm watching you right now.

1243
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:30,554
Domsey's Bakery.
How can I help you?

1244
00:52:31,269 --> 00:52:35,425
Hello, yes, do you still have the
pineapple upside-down cake?

1245
00:52:35,492 --> 00:52:38,209
Yes, we do. Would you like
chocolate or vanilla frosting?

1246
00:52:38,597 --> 00:52:40,986
Neither. I'm only
interested in merengue.

1247
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:43,867
Please give me your
access code and releasing ID.

1248
00:52:43,941 --> 00:52:47,803
This is Santa.
Releasing ID 7726548.

1249
00:52:48,997 --> 00:52:50,688
I need all-source,
derogatory only,

1250
00:52:50,757 --> 00:52:52,611
on a person
named Andi Garcia.

1251
00:52:52,708 --> 00:52:54,432
Alpha November
Delta Indigo...

1252
00:52:54,501 --> 00:52:57,468
Santa, your clearances
haven't been active for 12 years.

1253
00:52:58,116 --> 00:52:59,709
Now, you listen to me,
Young Turk.

1254
00:52:59,781 --> 00:53:01,374
I was bugging
Ho Chi Minh's sock drawer

1255
00:53:01,477 --> 00:53:02,687
while you were
still in diapers,

1256
00:53:02,757 --> 00:53:04,350
so don't tell me
about clearances.

1257
00:53:04,421 --> 00:53:06,014
Sir, my hands are tied.

1258
00:53:06,085 --> 00:53:08,573
But, I mean, you could
probably just google the subject

1259
00:53:08,645 --> 00:53:10,914
and find out everything
you need to know.

1260
00:53:11,301 --> 00:53:12,250
Oh.

1261
00:53:12,357 --> 00:53:14,691
Then I'll do that.
Santa out.

1262
00:53:23,877 --> 00:53:24,826
Hmm.

1263
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:46,047
Oh, honey, I can't wait to see
Kevin's timeshare later today, huh?

1264
00:53:46,597 --> 00:53:48,735
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1265
00:53:48,804 --> 00:53:49,884
What you doing?

1266
00:53:50,533 --> 00:53:51,940
Oh, just checking
the weather.

1267
00:53:52,005 --> 00:53:53,314
There's a cold front
coming in.

1268
00:53:53,381 --> 00:53:54,428
Oh, no.

1269
00:53:54,501 --> 00:53:55,483
Oh, yeah.

1270
00:54:02,181 --> 00:54:03,326
Thanks.

1271
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:06,202
Greg.

1272
00:54:06,853 --> 00:54:08,260
Hey, how you doing?
Sorry, I'm late.

1273
00:54:08,325 --> 00:54:09,405
Hi, honey.

1274
00:54:10,565 --> 00:54:12,125
A little emergency
at the hospital.

1275
00:54:12,196 --> 00:54:14,433
Kevin was showing us
his magnificent estate.

1276
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:15,516
It's really nice.

1277
00:54:15,589 --> 00:54:16,571
So this is where
you rough it

1278
00:54:16,644 --> 00:54:17,855
when you're not at
the homeless shelter?

1279
00:54:17,925 --> 00:54:20,478
Kind of split time between
the two. Maybe 60/40 here.

1280
00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:22,436
- Really?
- Now that Greg's finally arrived,

1281
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,289
why don't I take you over
to see the meadow?

1282
00:54:33,668 --> 00:54:34,650
Yeah, this is perfect.

1283
00:54:34,724 --> 00:54:36,251
- Oh, this is impressive.
- Wow, nice backyard.

1284
00:54:36,357 --> 00:54:37,666
- Yeah, love it.
- Wow, it is.

1285
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:38,747
Thank you.

1286
00:54:38,853 --> 00:54:40,380
Let's reserve that
quadrant over there, Kevin.

1287
00:54:40,453 --> 00:54:41,914
It's perfect for
the three-legged race,

1288
00:54:41,989 --> 00:54:43,265
egg toss,
capture-the-flag game.

1289
00:54:43,333 --> 00:54:47,107
Why don't we put up a ring of
bouncy castles right out there

1290
00:54:47,173 --> 00:54:48,995
and we have, like,
a relay race for the kids

1291
00:54:49,061 --> 00:54:51,297
kind of intertwined
in between them.

1292
00:54:51,365 --> 00:54:52,412
Loving it, Kev-O.

1293
00:54:52,485 --> 00:54:54,427
Kevin, is that
a tattoo on your back?

1294
00:54:54,501 --> 00:54:55,613
Oh, yes, it is, Dina.

1295
00:54:55,685 --> 00:54:57,790
It looks really elaborate.
Could we take a look at it?

1296
00:54:57,861 --> 00:54:59,105
- Oh, sure.
- Mom.

1297
00:54:59,173 --> 00:55:00,995
Well, it's a curiosity.

1298
00:55:02,277 --> 00:55:03,935
My gosh.

1299
00:55:05,637 --> 00:55:06,586
Hmm.

1300
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:08,031
Wow.

1301
00:55:08,676 --> 00:55:09,953
Is that Pam?

1302
00:55:10,021 --> 00:55:11,330
Yeah, it is.

1303
00:55:11,397 --> 00:55:13,055
You know, after the
whole Svetlana episode,

1304
00:55:13,124 --> 00:55:15,229
I went on a little bit of
a drunken bender

1305
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:18,170
and wound up in
a tattoo shop in Moscow.

1306
00:55:18,245 --> 00:55:19,968
And I asked
the artist to ink me

1307
00:55:20,037 --> 00:55:21,379
with the image
of the one woman

1308
00:55:21,445 --> 00:55:24,030
who's always loved me
unconditionally.

1309
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:25,791
- Pam.
- My grandmother.

1310
00:55:26,308 --> 00:55:28,283
The point being,
in my drunken stupor,

1311
00:55:28,357 --> 00:55:30,658
I must have handed him
a photo of Pam instead.

1312
00:55:30,949 --> 00:55:32,804
You carry a picture
of Pam in your wallet.

1313
00:55:32,869 --> 00:55:34,909
I do. I carry pictures
of many treasured friends

1314
00:55:34,981 --> 00:55:36,159
and loved ones
on my travels.

1315
00:55:37,061 --> 00:55:38,239
Got a picture of me?

1316
00:55:38,309 --> 00:55:40,251
Of course I got
a picture of you.

1317
00:55:40,325 --> 00:55:42,364
You recognize this
mensch right here?

1318
00:55:43,044 --> 00:55:44,571
- Ah. There I am. Kind of.
- There you are, yeah.

1319
00:55:44,645 --> 00:55:45,855
That's...
Interesting.

1320
00:55:45,924 --> 00:55:47,680
This is actually a very flattering
portrait of you, Pam-cake.

1321
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:49,753
- Excuse me.
- Dad.

1322
00:55:49,829 --> 00:55:51,105
Prudence? Yes! Hello!

1323
00:55:51,172 --> 00:55:52,121
Yeah, hold on, honey.
I don't...

1324
00:55:53,125 --> 00:55:55,710
Terrific. Okay,
yes, thanks, Pru.

1325
00:55:56,324 --> 00:55:59,172
That was Prudence and she
says if you get to E.H.S. by 3:00,

1326
00:55:59,237 --> 00:56:00,698
she can squeeze you in
for an interview.

1327
00:56:00,772 --> 00:56:02,201
- All right, that's great!
- Way to go, Kev-O.

1328
00:56:02,277 --> 00:56:03,554
- Thank you, Kevin.
- Good job.

1329
00:56:06,309 --> 00:56:07,836
So great you two
could join us.

1330
00:56:08,133 --> 00:56:10,948
Really wonderful when
grandparents play an integral role

1331
00:56:11,013 --> 00:56:12,835
- in early humans' lives.
- We love them.

1332
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:14,427
Early humans
do need guidance.

1333
00:56:15,076 --> 00:56:17,662
Is that your role, Jack?
To guide them?

1334
00:56:17,733 --> 00:56:19,773
Yes, I see myself
as something of a shepherd,

1335
00:56:19,845 --> 00:56:22,463
guiding our family
through life's pastures.

1336
00:56:22,533 --> 00:56:25,729
Yes, I would say Jack is sort
of an honorary shepherd.

1337
00:56:25,797 --> 00:56:28,796
Kind of a shepherd
emeritus, if you will.

1338
00:56:29,157 --> 00:56:33,150
Well, when my sheep wander,
I use my prod to keep my flock in line.

1339
00:56:34,597 --> 00:56:38,241
Oh, there are a lot of family
dynamics at play here.

1340
00:56:39,013 --> 00:56:40,737
Why don't we begin
the interview process?

1341
00:56:41,829 --> 00:56:45,506
Okay, Henry, I just want
you to clear your mind

1342
00:56:45,892 --> 00:56:49,918
and draw a picture for me of the
first thing that comes to mind

1343
00:56:49,988 --> 00:56:52,771
when you hear
the word "family".

1344
00:56:53,476 --> 00:56:54,425
Oh.

1345
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:56,766
This is just like being
at the eye doctor.

1346
00:56:56,837 --> 00:56:58,692
Start at the top
and work your way down.

1347
00:56:58,853 --> 00:57:00,511
Why would she
give her an eye test?

1348
00:57:00,581 --> 00:57:02,653
It's called
a Heisenreich Experiment.

1349
00:57:02,724 --> 00:57:04,251
We used it
at the agency to test

1350
00:57:04,325 --> 00:57:05,951
the aptitude of
potential recruits.

1351
00:57:07,397 --> 00:57:10,179
All the letters are the same,
so it's not really an eye test.

1352
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:13,759
Very impressive
cognition, Samantha.

1353
00:57:14,053 --> 00:57:16,322
E... E...

1354
00:57:17,893 --> 00:57:20,543
E? I need to start over.

1355
00:57:22,149 --> 00:57:25,248
Okay, Henry, let's see
what you've chosen to draw.

1356
00:57:26,661 --> 00:57:27,774
What is it?
What did he draw?

1357
00:57:30,212 --> 00:57:34,206
Dad stuck Grandpa Jack in the
wee-wee last night. Because he's old.

1358
00:57:34,565 --> 00:57:36,026
I'm sorry?
What did he say?

1359
00:57:36,101 --> 00:57:37,345
I didn't hear him.

1360
00:57:37,701 --> 00:57:39,555
Something about
Grandpa Jack having a cold.

1361
00:57:39,908 --> 00:57:41,796
So tell me about
your parents, Samantha.

1362
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:44,512
Tell me about
your parents, Prudence.

1363
00:57:48,133 --> 00:57:49,148
That's my girl.

1364
00:57:49,508 --> 00:57:51,101
Wanna tell me
about your family?

1365
00:57:51,172 --> 00:57:52,416
My dad is a great guy.

1366
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:53,659
Thank you, buddy.

1367
00:57:54,564 --> 00:57:57,532
But Grandpa Jack makes him
really, really scared.

1368
00:57:57,605 --> 00:57:59,459
So he acts all crazy
when he's with him.

1369
00:57:59,525 --> 00:58:02,492
Like he tried to cut the
turkey with Grandpa's big knife

1370
00:58:02,565 --> 00:58:07,267
and he slipped and he cut his finger.
And he was like, "Oh, shit!"

1371
00:58:09,285 --> 00:58:10,878
Oh, he's blowing
the interview.

1372
00:58:10,949 --> 00:58:13,153
She's setting him up to fail
with these questions.

1373
00:58:13,221 --> 00:58:15,392
I mean, Sam's a better
tester, anyway, so...

1374
00:58:15,461 --> 00:58:17,054
Well, that's because
she takes after...

1375
00:58:17,125 --> 00:58:18,434
Takes after who, Jack?

1376
00:58:18,501 --> 00:58:20,738
Let's just say I've done
some research on twins.

1377
00:58:20,805 --> 00:58:22,234
There's a theory that
in certain cases,

1378
00:58:22,309 --> 00:58:24,764
one twin gets an extra
chromosome from the father,

1379
00:58:24,837 --> 00:58:26,724
while the other sibling
gets an extra chromosome

1380
00:58:26,788 --> 00:58:27,868
from the mother's side.

1381
00:58:27,941 --> 00:58:28,923
Hmm.

1382
00:58:29,157 --> 00:58:31,044
Sam might be
three quarters Byrnes,

1383
00:58:31,109 --> 00:58:32,516
whereas Henry
could very well have

1384
00:58:32,581 --> 00:58:34,337
a double dose
of Focker in him.

1385
00:58:35,653 --> 00:58:37,027
And what if he does?

1386
00:58:37,508 --> 00:58:39,581
My Grandpa Bernie taught
me this. Pull my finger.

1387
00:58:39,973 --> 00:58:40,922
Oh.

1388
00:58:44,261 --> 00:58:45,243
Double dose.

1389
00:58:47,716 --> 00:58:50,335
Let's go out to the courtyard
for some free play.

1390
00:58:51,556 --> 00:58:53,891
I mean, what is
"free-play test"?

1391
00:58:53,957 --> 00:58:55,233
How well they hang
on the monkey bars?

1392
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:56,348
I don't think
you get it, Greg.

1393
00:58:56,869 --> 00:58:58,178
You know when prison
guards learn the most

1394
00:58:58,245 --> 00:59:00,514
about their inmate
population?

1395
00:59:00,581 --> 00:59:01,791
During rec time
in the yard.

1396
00:59:02,212 --> 00:59:03,838
I'm sure Prudence is
in her office right now

1397
00:59:03,909 --> 00:59:05,469
watching every move
these kids make.

1398
00:59:07,077 --> 00:59:08,091
- Dad?
- Yeah.

1399
00:59:08,165 --> 00:59:10,140
Can I please go climb
that big rock wall?

1400
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:11,620
Yeah, okay.
Just be careful, buddy, all right?

1401
00:59:11,685 --> 00:59:13,026
All right.

1402
00:59:13,093 --> 00:59:14,500
Do you think
he can handle that?

1403
00:59:14,565 --> 00:59:15,809
What's the big deal?

1404
00:59:15,877 --> 00:59:18,244
I'm just not sure you've
instilled the physical confidence

1405
00:59:18,309 --> 00:59:19,770
for him to shear
a face like that.

1406
00:59:20,196 --> 00:59:23,579
Jack, do me a favor.
Just let go of the reins a little, okay?

1407
00:59:24,005 --> 00:59:26,525
I'll let go, Greg, when you
show me, once and for all,

1408
00:59:26,597 --> 00:59:28,004
that you have
what it takes to lead.

1409
00:59:28,549 --> 00:59:30,621
I am in control
of my family, all right?

1410
00:59:30,693 --> 00:59:33,344
If I give Henry permission to
climb a wall, he can climb a wall.

1411
00:59:33,413 --> 00:59:35,518
If he says he wants to climb
the Empire State Building

1412
00:59:35,589 --> 00:59:36,701
and I say it's okay,

1413
00:59:36,772 --> 00:59:38,266
it's okay,
because I'm in charge.

1414
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:40,315
All right?
I'm calling the plays now.

1415
00:59:40,389 --> 00:59:43,553
So you just got to step back and
accept the fact that I have got this.

1416
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:44,569
Whoa!

1417
00:59:46,661 --> 00:59:49,279
Oh, he is such
a brave boy, isn't he?

1418
00:59:49,348 --> 00:59:51,737
See, it's not so bad.
It's just a slight fracture.

1419
00:59:51,845 --> 00:59:53,121
Okay, thanks.

1420
00:59:53,188 --> 00:59:54,137
Hey, Henry,
are you doing all right?

1421
00:59:56,261 --> 00:59:58,148
Hey, I came
as soon as I heard.

1422
00:59:58,213 --> 01:00:01,213
Prudence told me there was a
little bit of a kerfuffle over at E.H.S.

1423
01:00:01,284 --> 01:00:03,172
Oh, that's an understatement.
Thanks to Greg,

1424
01:00:03,237 --> 01:00:05,441
we can wave goodbye
to their educational future.

1425
01:00:05,509 --> 01:00:06,524
Jack.

1426
01:00:06,597 --> 01:00:07,807
Oh, no, no.
Pru's a forgiving soul.

1427
01:00:07,877 --> 01:00:10,048
I think I can patch things up.
In the meantime,

1428
01:00:10,116 --> 01:00:12,451
I got a little something
for Hank the Tank here.

1429
01:00:12,869 --> 01:00:15,716
Someone to keep you company
until you're reunited with Arthur.

1430
01:00:16,484 --> 01:00:18,240
- What is that?
- Thanks, Papa Kev.

1431
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:19,838
Papa Kev?

1432
01:00:19,909 --> 01:00:21,021
Yeah, old fraternity nickname.

1433
01:00:21,092 --> 01:00:24,388
I told Hank the Tank here he
could call me by that handle.

1434
01:00:24,453 --> 01:00:27,006
You're not Hank the Tank.
Nobody calls him Hank the Tank.

1435
01:00:27,365 --> 01:00:28,347
You wanna be Papa Greg?

1436
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:31,355
No, I am Papa... I'm Greg.
I'm Greg, his papa.

1437
01:00:31,429 --> 01:00:32,476
So I don't need
to be Papa Greg.

1438
01:00:32,548 --> 01:00:34,141
I don't need to put a
little thing in front of it.

1439
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:35,260
Paging Nurse Focker.

1440
01:00:35,332 --> 01:00:36,893
Pam, we need to talk
for a minute.

1441
01:00:37,285 --> 01:00:38,300
Oh, okay. Mom?

1442
01:00:41,125 --> 01:00:42,532
Hey, Louis, what's up?

1443
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:44,670
What's up, dawg?
Hey, hottie at 2:00.

1444
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:45,820
There's the superstar!

1445
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:46,907
Hey, hi, hi.

1446
01:00:46,981 --> 01:00:48,290
- Hey!
- Oh. Hello.

1447
01:00:48,965 --> 01:00:50,787
I have the raddest
news ever!

1448
01:00:50,852 --> 01:00:52,194
Really? Okay.

1449
01:00:52,581 --> 01:00:54,970
So our VP of marketing
heard how well you did

1450
01:00:55,044 --> 01:00:56,932
on your speech last night
and guess what?

1451
01:00:57,029 --> 01:00:58,011
What?

1452
01:00:58,085 --> 01:01:01,859
He wants us to lead the Pfosten
convention in Maui next month.

1453
01:01:02,053 --> 01:01:04,060
Yeah, that sounds great.
Honestly, I'm sorry.

1454
01:01:04,132 --> 01:01:05,277
I'm just a little
distracted right now

1455
01:01:05,348 --> 01:01:06,461
'cause my son just
broke his arm and...

1456
01:01:06,533 --> 01:01:07,580
Oh, poor baby.

1457
01:01:07,653 --> 01:01:08,733
Yeah, so...

1458
01:01:08,805 --> 01:01:09,852
You're a super dad.

1459
01:01:09,925 --> 01:01:12,772
- No, I'm not a super dad.
- It is so cute

1460
01:01:12,837 --> 01:01:15,040
how involved you are
with your kids.

1461
01:01:15,109 --> 01:01:18,240
No, no, no, that's just what
dads do. It's not like a super...

1462
01:01:18,309 --> 01:01:20,164
- Louis! What are you doing?
- Is this the book?

1463
01:01:20,229 --> 01:01:21,636
What is...
No, go. Come on.

1464
01:01:21,701 --> 01:01:23,588
In the back, right?
I got them.

1465
01:01:24,452 --> 01:01:25,729
Sorry, it's just...

1466
01:01:25,797 --> 01:01:27,007
Somebody's grumpy.

1467
01:01:27,461 --> 01:01:29,087
I'm gonna make this
brief, Pam-cake.

1468
01:01:29,157 --> 01:01:30,302
I'm not getting
any younger.

1469
01:01:30,373 --> 01:01:31,802
- Dad.
- No, I want to make sure

1470
01:01:31,876 --> 01:01:34,691
there's someone around besides
me who you can fully count on.

1471
01:01:34,756 --> 01:01:36,480
I couldn't help but notice
how you and Kevin

1472
01:01:36,549 --> 01:01:38,556
have reconnected
these past few days.

1473
01:01:38,629 --> 01:01:40,963
He's financially secure.
He's great with the twins.

1474
01:01:41,029 --> 01:01:42,011
Got a heart of gold.

1475
01:01:42,405 --> 01:01:43,899
He's a little goofy,
maybe, in his dressing,

1476
01:01:43,973 --> 01:01:45,402
but if that body art
is any indication,

1477
01:01:45,477 --> 01:01:47,167
I'd say he's certainly
open to the idea.

1478
01:01:48,196 --> 01:01:49,211
What idea?

1479
01:01:50,181 --> 01:01:52,898
The idea of a simple
course correction.

1480
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:55,355
A course correction.

1481
01:01:55,461 --> 01:01:57,403
Greg, Kevin.

1482
01:01:59,493 --> 01:02:01,795
Come on, grumpy daddy!
Come to Hawaii.

1483
01:02:01,861 --> 01:02:03,006
Okay.

1484
01:02:03,077 --> 01:02:04,637
Okay, grumpy daddy
will think about it.

1485
01:02:04,708 --> 01:02:05,853
- Yes!
- Okay, okay.

1486
01:02:05,924 --> 01:02:07,866
Oh! Hey, honey, hi!

1487
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:12,155
Perfect. Pam, this is Andi.
Andi, this is Pam, my wife.

1488
01:02:12,613 --> 01:02:13,595
Hey.

1489
01:02:13,669 --> 01:02:15,676
Hi, it's a...
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1490
01:02:15,749 --> 01:02:17,309
It's a pleasure
to meet you, too.

1491
01:02:17,381 --> 01:02:19,137
Your husband
is a freaking rock star,

1492
01:02:19,205 --> 01:02:21,507
but I'm sure you know
how lucky you are.

1493
01:02:21,573 --> 01:02:23,395
Yeah. I'm not.
She's the rock star.

1494
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:26,875
She's a rock star mom and
just full-on, rocking person.

1495
01:02:27,109 --> 01:02:28,091
Oh.

1496
01:02:28,164 --> 01:02:29,506
And I'm just a groupie

1497
01:02:29,957 --> 01:02:33,121
trying to, you know,
carry her amps.

1498
01:02:33,349 --> 01:02:35,585
No, you're... You're...
You're the man.

1499
01:02:35,813 --> 01:02:37,668
Everything
all right here?

1500
01:02:38,468 --> 01:02:39,581
Yeah, Jack,
everything's all right.

1501
01:02:39,653 --> 01:02:41,758
- Pam, do you wanna...
- Oh, my God.

1502
01:02:41,829 --> 01:02:44,928
You must be
the famous Jack Byrnes.

1503
01:02:44,997 --> 01:02:47,680
Wow. I have heard
so much about you.

1504
01:02:48,485 --> 01:02:50,656
I've heard very little
about you, Miss Garcia.

1505
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:52,896
But I do admire your
cheerleading photographs.

1506
01:02:53,285 --> 01:02:54,659
Henry's doing much better.

1507
01:02:54,725 --> 01:02:56,765
We were just singing
an ancient Yanomamo song

1508
01:02:56,837 --> 01:02:58,746
about a brave warrior
who falls from a tree

1509
01:02:58,821 --> 01:03:01,025
while hunting
for chimpanzee meat.

1510
01:03:01,093 --> 01:03:03,003
He's good. Yeah.

1511
01:03:03,461 --> 01:03:04,890
- Hi.
- Hi.

1512
01:03:04,965 --> 01:03:07,332
Andi Garcia.
Pfosten Pharmaceuticals.

1513
01:03:08,005 --> 01:03:09,412
And you're Doctor...

1514
01:03:09,477 --> 01:03:10,786
No. He's not a doctor.

1515
01:03:10,852 --> 01:03:12,608
Not in the Western
sense of the word.

1516
01:03:12,868 --> 01:03:15,039
Not in any sense of the word.
You're an investment banker.

1517
01:03:15,812 --> 01:03:17,089
Many hats. Kevin.

1518
01:03:17,157 --> 01:03:18,106
Hi.

1519
01:03:19,557 --> 01:03:20,636
Okay, cool.

1520
01:03:20,708 --> 01:03:22,269
Well, I'm gonna
mosey on out of here.

1521
01:03:23,492 --> 01:03:24,475
All right.

1522
01:03:27,557 --> 01:03:29,280
Wow, you told me she sold
boner medicine, Greg.

1523
01:03:29,348 --> 01:03:30,396
You didn't tell me
she is boner medicine.

1524
01:03:30,469 --> 01:03:31,516
Pam, that's ridiculous.

1525
01:03:31,589 --> 01:03:33,727
You also said you wouldn't
pick her out of a lineup, too.

1526
01:03:33,796 --> 01:03:35,203
Wouldn't pick her
out of a lineup?

1527
01:03:35,269 --> 01:03:36,545
Greg, that woman
is stunning!

1528
01:03:36,613 --> 01:03:37,955
Oh, he's covering, Kevin,

1529
01:03:38,021 --> 01:03:39,908
'cause he didn't want
Pam to get suspicious.

1530
01:03:39,973 --> 01:03:41,566
- Dad.
- Did you see the way his carotid artery

1531
01:03:41,637 --> 01:03:42,880
throbbed when he looked at her?

1532
01:03:42,949 --> 01:03:44,509
- Dad.
- Give me a break, Jack. Come on.

1533
01:03:44,581 --> 01:03:45,890
Now this is what
I'm talking about, Pam.

1534
01:03:45,957 --> 01:03:47,844
I'm sorry, but this
man cannot be trusted.

1535
01:03:47,909 --> 01:03:50,178
Could you for once in your
life stay out of my marriage?

1536
01:03:50,245 --> 01:03:51,805
Greg, come on,
don't get hysterical.

1537
01:03:51,876 --> 01:03:53,698
I'm not getting hysterical.
He's getting hysterical.

1538
01:03:53,765 --> 01:03:55,619
Look, it's natural
to get a little tempted.

1539
01:03:55,685 --> 01:03:56,667
Nobody's tempted, nobody's...

1540
01:03:56,740 --> 01:03:57,951
Look, even our dear friend,
the Buddha,

1541
01:03:58,021 --> 01:03:59,166
had to pass through
some sorrow

1542
01:03:59,237 --> 01:04:00,513
on his way to enlightenment.

1543
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:02,141
Our dear friend,
the Buddha?

1544
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:03,773
How's he doing?
It's been so long.

1545
01:04:04,229 --> 01:04:05,341
Do you ever
listen to yourself?

1546
01:04:05,413 --> 01:04:06,493
I try not to.

1547
01:04:06,565 --> 01:04:08,704
I speak from the heart,
off the cuff, like my man, JC,

1548
01:04:08,773 --> 01:04:09,950
at the Sermon on the Mount.

1549
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:11,930
I think that's what you've
always admired about me.

1550
01:04:12,005 --> 01:04:14,012
Well, I got news for you.
You're not Jesus.

1551
01:04:14,085 --> 01:04:15,678
Well, he may not be Jesus,

1552
01:04:15,749 --> 01:04:17,210
but he's a far better choice
for Pam than you are, Greg.

1553
01:04:17,285 --> 01:04:18,398
Dad!

1554
01:04:18,469 --> 01:04:19,483
- I'm sorry.
- Would you stop

1555
01:04:19,557 --> 01:04:21,084
- with the course-correction stuff?
- No, that's right...

1556
01:04:21,157 --> 01:04:22,466
- What's the course-correction stuff?
- It's nothing.

1557
01:04:22,533 --> 01:04:23,743
I want to hear
all about it, Jack.

1558
01:04:23,812 --> 01:04:27,074
You're leading this family
onto rocky shoals, Focker,

1559
01:04:27,141 --> 01:04:28,351
and as captain
of the ship,

1560
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:29,664
I'm steering us away
to safety.

1561
01:04:29,732 --> 01:04:31,740
Well, you know what?
You're not a ship's captain, Jack.

1562
01:04:31,813 --> 01:04:34,268
We're people. We're not on a boat,
we're in a hospital. Okay?

1563
01:04:34,341 --> 01:04:37,090
We're human beings in a
hospital and you're not the captain.

1564
01:04:37,156 --> 01:04:39,612
Well, I may not be the
captain, Gregory Focker,

1565
01:04:39,684 --> 01:04:41,343
but you're not
the Godfocker!

1566
01:04:42,725 --> 01:04:45,442
Good. 'Cause I don't want
to be the stupid Godfocker.

1567
01:04:46,213 --> 01:04:49,628
I'm the Greg Focker, Jack!
All right? I am Greg Focker!

1568
01:04:49,701 --> 01:04:52,090
And by the way, Dr. Bob told
me you offered him the job first.

1569
01:04:52,164 --> 01:04:53,539
Nice to know I was
your sloppy seconds.

1570
01:04:53,605 --> 01:04:54,947
You spoke to Dr. Bob?

1571
01:04:55,013 --> 01:04:56,573
Yeah, I did, Jack.

1572
01:04:56,645 --> 01:04:57,758
Had beers with him
last night.

1573
01:04:57,829 --> 01:04:58,777
He's in town
for a convention.

1574
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:00,347
That's it. You're done.

1575
01:05:00,421 --> 01:05:01,697
- You're done, it's over, that's it.
- You know what?

1576
01:05:01,764 --> 01:05:03,259
You can't tell me I'm done
because I already quit.

1577
01:05:03,332 --> 01:05:04,576
- You're done.
- I'm getting off the wheel.

1578
01:05:04,644 --> 01:05:05,626
- What wheel?
- The wheel!

1579
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:07,456
The little hamster wheel
that we're all running up

1580
01:05:07,524 --> 01:05:09,761
to get a little taste
of your little water thingy!

1581
01:05:09,829 --> 01:05:10,844
Just, please,
approval! Approval!

1582
01:05:10,917 --> 01:05:11,899
What the hell
are you doing?

1583
01:05:11,972 --> 01:05:13,467
Please! Give me some
of the Jack... Yeah.

1584
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:15,002
It's like a metaphor
for your approval...

1585
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:16,419
Thank you for
clearing that up!

1586
01:05:16,485 --> 01:05:17,979
What are you even
doing here, Kevin?

1587
01:05:18,053 --> 01:05:19,427
- I'm trying to help.
- Why don't you get on

1588
01:05:19,492 --> 01:05:20,605
your stupid monster yacht

1589
01:05:20,677 --> 01:05:22,138
with your bubble-butt
Russian girlfriend

1590
01:05:22,213 --> 01:05:25,083
and do Jell-O shots
off of Deepak Chopra's butt?

1591
01:05:25,156 --> 01:05:27,425
Greg, don't drag Deepak
into this. Please, Greg.

1592
01:05:28,484 --> 01:05:32,194
Hey, Dina. Jack had a heart
attack two weeks ago. Adios, folks!

1593
01:05:39,493 --> 01:05:40,475
Going down.

1594
01:05:40,549 --> 01:05:41,498
Hey.

1595
01:05:42,245 --> 01:05:43,488
- Hey.
- You okay?

1596
01:05:45,093 --> 01:05:46,719
Yeah.

1597
01:05:46,789 --> 01:05:47,771
Need a ride?

1598
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:52,032
Hey, it's Pam.
Leave me a message.

1599
01:05:52,101 --> 01:05:53,377
Hey, I'm gonna
sleep over

1600
01:05:53,444 --> 01:05:54,906
at the new house tonight,
all right?

1601
01:05:54,981 --> 01:05:57,086
I just can't deal
with your dad right now.

1602
01:06:00,261 --> 01:06:01,668
Are you sure
you're gonna be okay?

1603
01:06:01,732 --> 01:06:04,961
Yeah, I think I just need to clear
my head. Thanks for the ride.

1604
01:06:05,029 --> 01:06:06,011
No problem.

1605
01:06:09,797 --> 01:06:12,317
Why am I the bad guy here? Greg
was the one who was being dishonest.

1606
01:06:12,388 --> 01:06:15,683
Oh, please. All Greg did was
downplay that woman's looks,

1607
01:06:15,749 --> 01:06:18,018
so Pam wouldn't be jealous,
and you know it.

1608
01:06:18,085 --> 01:06:19,263
You know you did
the same thing

1609
01:06:19,333 --> 01:06:21,504
with that gorgeous
double agent in Helsinki

1610
01:06:21,573 --> 01:06:22,620
during the Cold War.

1611
01:06:22,693 --> 01:06:24,864
Oh, you're still bringing up
Aatukka Kokkonen.

1612
01:06:24,932 --> 01:06:27,267
I told you her beauty
was privileged information.

1613
01:06:27,333 --> 01:06:28,926
It was a matter of
national security.

1614
01:06:28,997 --> 01:06:31,266
Oh, yes.
Like your heart condition?

1615
01:06:31,333 --> 01:06:32,380
Listen, Jack.

1616
01:06:33,125 --> 01:06:35,197
Greg cares about his family

1617
01:06:35,269 --> 01:06:38,236
just as much as you care
about yours. All right?

1618
01:06:48,068 --> 01:06:49,083
Pam?

1619
01:06:56,165 --> 01:06:59,034
Don't be mad. I totally
don't want to harass you.

1620
01:06:59,109 --> 01:07:02,142
You just seemed so sad,
I had to bring you some treats.

1621
01:07:02,853 --> 01:07:04,762
Oh. Wow, thanks.

1622
01:07:05,348 --> 01:07:08,250
Some Chinese food.
Little wine.

1623
01:07:10,244 --> 01:07:11,673
No offense,

1624
01:07:11,749 --> 01:07:13,636
but does Pam even
realize how dope you are?

1625
01:07:13,701 --> 01:07:16,767
Oh, yeah, no.
I think she thinks I'm dope.

1626
01:07:16,837 --> 01:07:17,851
It's just, you know,

1627
01:07:19,044 --> 01:07:20,288
it just changes
when you have kids,

1628
01:07:20,356 --> 01:07:22,179
you know, because everything
becomes focused around them.

1629
01:07:22,245 --> 01:07:23,772
Totally. And I'm sure
you're like,

1630
01:07:23,844 --> 01:07:25,917
"Hello! Can I have
some fun, too?"

1631
01:07:26,757 --> 01:07:29,572
Yeah, no. I mean, it's fun,
but it's just a different kind of fun.

1632
01:07:29,637 --> 01:07:30,652
More wine.

1633
01:07:30,725 --> 01:07:33,059
It's not like old single fun,
where you go out.

1634
01:07:33,125 --> 01:07:36,769
It's more like wake up in the morning
at 6:00, make the kids breakfast.

1635
01:07:36,837 --> 01:07:38,462
You know, that kind of fun.

1636
01:07:38,533 --> 01:07:40,126
I love it. I mean,
they're so cute.

1637
01:07:40,197 --> 01:07:41,724
Like, the other day,
Henry came in

1638
01:07:41,797 --> 01:07:44,164
and he had his little
top hat on and said,

1639
01:07:44,229 --> 01:07:45,505
"I'm the mayor
of the kitchen."

1640
01:07:45,572 --> 01:07:47,099
Oh, he's gonna be the mayor?

1641
01:07:47,205 --> 01:07:49,441
Just out of nowhere he got this
idea he wanted to be the mayor.

1642
01:07:49,508 --> 01:07:51,069
And then he came in
and he said,

1643
01:07:51,141 --> 01:07:54,305
"And here is a proclamation.
You cannot use the frigerator."

1644
01:07:54,373 --> 01:07:57,918
And he had a sash on.
I think I have a picture of it.

1645
01:07:57,988 --> 01:08:00,606
Yeah. I mean, I'm biased,
but he's very creative.

1646
01:08:02,149 --> 01:08:03,610
I'm going to
step out for a bit

1647
01:08:03,685 --> 01:08:05,114
and get some milk
for the morning.

1648
01:08:05,189 --> 01:08:07,938
Don't, Jack. We both know
that's not true.

1649
01:08:09,605 --> 01:08:11,776
I don't know why I still think
I can get anything by you.

1650
01:08:12,388 --> 01:08:13,337
Mmm.

1651
01:08:14,533 --> 01:08:16,867
I'm going to find Greg.
I'm going to bring him home.

1652
01:08:16,933 --> 01:08:17,915
You know where he is?

1653
01:08:17,989 --> 01:08:18,971
I have an idea.

1654
01:08:20,228 --> 01:08:23,545
And for the record, nothing ever
happened with Aatukka Kokkonen.

1655
01:08:25,093 --> 01:08:26,041
Aw.

1656
01:08:26,149 --> 01:08:28,963
And this is the play
that she wrote called Tropical Seas.

1657
01:08:29,029 --> 01:08:30,305
They're so cute.

1658
01:08:30,373 --> 01:08:31,617
Yeah. They really are.

1659
01:08:33,508 --> 01:08:34,621
That's you!

1660
01:08:34,693 --> 01:08:36,733
Yes. I am
an algae-seaweed-type plant.

1661
01:08:37,477 --> 01:08:38,906
You know,
I got to go home.

1662
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:40,890
Yeah, I totally get that.

1663
01:08:44,773 --> 01:08:46,333
Andi, Andi, no, no, no.

1664
01:08:46,404 --> 01:08:47,386
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1665
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:48,540
Andi, I think I gave you
the wrong idea. No...

1666
01:09:14,596 --> 01:09:16,091
Greg, ever since we
tag-teamed on that enema,

1667
01:09:16,164 --> 01:09:17,212
I've wanted you.

1668
01:09:17,285 --> 01:09:20,962
It was just an enema. Really,
I think you're idealizing the enema.

1669
01:09:21,029 --> 01:09:23,298
Andi, you know what, I think you
might have had a little too much wine.

1670
01:09:23,365 --> 01:09:27,391
Wine is fine, papi!
I took a few Sustengo.

1671
01:09:27,461 --> 01:09:29,600
You took a Sustengo?
Why would you do that?

1672
01:09:31,141 --> 01:09:32,351
That's crazy.
I'm gonna call a cab.

1673
01:09:36,324 --> 01:09:38,299
Can I see more
pictures of your kids?

1674
01:09:39,396 --> 01:09:42,692
Definitely not. You can't... You
got to put your thing back on.

1675
01:09:42,757 --> 01:09:44,066
Don't be a grumpy daddy!

1676
01:09:44,133 --> 01:09:45,759
I'm not being a grumpy...
You got to...

1677
01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:13,217
No, Andi!
Andi, give me the phone!

1678
01:10:13,285 --> 01:10:14,943
- You want it?
- I do want it.

1679
01:10:15,013 --> 01:10:16,126
- Come and get it.
- I want... I...

1680
01:10:17,733 --> 01:10:19,424
Andi, it's not funny.

1681
01:10:19,749 --> 01:10:21,571
Let's go swimming!

1682
01:10:21,636 --> 01:10:22,716
Andi, no,
it's not a pool.

1683
01:10:22,789 --> 01:10:24,796
Is it heated?
Is there a grotto?

1684
01:10:24,868 --> 01:10:27,007
No, no, it's a pit!
Andi, don't do this.

1685
01:10:27,077 --> 01:10:29,182
Come on! Put your clothes
back on. All right?

1686
01:10:29,253 --> 01:10:31,325
Andi, no!
That's not nice!

1687
01:10:31,396 --> 01:10:33,568
You don't throw people's
phones in pits, okay?

1688
01:10:33,637 --> 01:10:34,684
You're mean!

1689
01:10:34,757 --> 01:10:36,099
Andi, put the clothes
back on! Come on!

1690
01:10:36,165 --> 01:10:37,474
I hate you!

1691
01:10:39,973 --> 01:10:41,631
Belly flop!

1692
01:11:03,301 --> 01:11:04,610
You really don't know
where Greg is?

1693
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:07,132
Honey, I struck out.

1694
01:11:07,205 --> 01:11:09,627
I guess my skills just
aren't what they used to be.

1695
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:11,075
Look who it is.
There they are!

1696
01:11:11,141 --> 01:11:12,089
Hey, Kevin!

1697
01:11:12,164 --> 01:11:13,986
- Kevin.
- Quite a shindig.

1698
01:11:14,053 --> 01:11:16,093
Well, you only
turn five once.

1699
01:11:16,164 --> 01:11:17,375
Or twice, in this case.

1700
01:11:17,797 --> 01:11:20,350
Now, I've got a little surprise
for you, Jack. Gustavo?

1701
01:11:22,309 --> 01:11:23,553
Is that who I think it is?

1702
01:11:23,621 --> 01:11:24,799
You'd better believe it.

1703
01:11:24,869 --> 01:11:26,014
Jinxy!

1704
01:11:26,085 --> 01:11:27,841
When I heard about your
health issues last night,

1705
01:11:27,909 --> 01:11:29,632
I knew I had to
fly him out here.

1706
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:31,969
Kevin, incredibly
thoughtful of you. Thank you.

1707
01:11:32,068 --> 01:11:34,075
How come Daddy's not here?

1708
01:11:34,148 --> 01:11:36,221
Is it because
I was mean to him?

1709
01:11:36,293 --> 01:11:39,042
No, honey,
absolutely not, sweetheart.

1710
01:11:39,109 --> 01:11:41,214
It's because
Grandpa was mean to him.

1711
01:11:41,285 --> 01:11:44,481
But he's coming! He's coming.
He will be here, okay?

1712
01:11:44,548 --> 01:11:46,436
So, let's go
have some more fun.

1713
01:11:46,501 --> 01:11:48,541
All right? Let's go.
Let's go see what else there is.

1714
01:11:54,501 --> 01:11:55,810
Just wait one sec!

1715
01:11:57,317 --> 01:11:58,397
Gay!

1716
01:12:04,964 --> 01:12:06,044
Gay!

1717
01:12:08,612 --> 01:12:09,627
Gay?

1718
01:12:10,789 --> 01:12:12,250
- Dad.
- What's that hole?

1719
01:12:12,325 --> 01:12:14,627
Why are you so muddy?
Where is everyone?

1720
01:12:14,693 --> 01:12:15,937
They're at Kevin's.

1721
01:12:16,005 --> 01:12:17,532
The party's over at Kevin's.
I got to get over there.

1722
01:12:17,604 --> 01:12:19,492
- The kids' party's at Kevin's?
- I thought you were in Spain.

1723
01:12:19,557 --> 01:12:22,524
I was, but I can't miss my
little gazugas turning five.

1724
01:12:22,596 --> 01:12:23,676
How are you?

1725
01:12:23,749 --> 01:12:26,204
Hey! Oh, man.
I'm so sorry.

1726
01:12:27,237 --> 01:12:29,888
I was so messed up
last night.

1727
01:12:31,909 --> 01:12:32,923
Who's that?

1728
01:12:32,997 --> 01:12:34,241
That is...
Dad, that's Andi Garcia.

1729
01:12:34,341 --> 01:12:35,682
Oh. She's a work
colleague of mine.

1730
01:12:35,749 --> 01:12:37,058
Oh, hi, Dad!

1731
01:12:37,125 --> 01:12:39,197
Yeah. She took a few too
many prescription pills

1732
01:12:39,268 --> 01:12:40,348
and then she
pushed me in the pit.

1733
01:12:40,421 --> 01:12:42,657
Total party foul.
My bad on that one.

1734
01:12:42,725 --> 01:12:44,099
Garcia? Is that Spanish?

1735
01:12:44,165 --> 01:12:45,147
Okay, we got to go.

1736
01:12:45,221 --> 01:12:46,268
Yeah. My grandparents
are from Seville.

1737
01:12:46,341 --> 01:12:49,505
Are you kidding? I was just in
Seville, mastering the flamenco!

1738
01:12:49,573 --> 01:12:50,620
- No way!
- Dad.

1739
01:12:50,692 --> 01:12:52,067
What? But I got to
show her a few moves.

1740
01:12:52,133 --> 01:12:53,442
Her grandparents
are from Seville.

1741
01:12:53,509 --> 01:12:54,916
Dad, no, no!
Dad, I got to go! Okay.

1742
01:12:59,461 --> 01:13:00,705
Your dad's really good.

1743
01:13:00,773 --> 01:13:02,977
The faster you go indicates
an increase in sexual prowess.

1744
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:04,157
Andi, good luck.

1745
01:13:07,749 --> 01:13:10,498
It's a good thing you pulled me away.
I was starting to get a semi.

1746
01:13:10,565 --> 01:13:12,059
Oh, Dad, please.
It's involuntary.

1747
01:13:12,133 --> 01:13:15,515
It's the parasympathetic nervous
system. Flamenco's very sexual.

1748
01:13:16,037 --> 01:13:17,630
Well, just so you know,
nothing happened with her.

1749
01:13:17,701 --> 01:13:20,384
I know that. We're Fockers.
That's not the way we roll.

1750
01:13:20,452 --> 01:13:23,354
But I know something went
down with the family. You okay?

1751
01:13:23,428 --> 01:13:26,974
Yeah, just the usual
Jack stuff. You okay?

1752
01:13:27,045 --> 01:13:30,078
Your mom was right. Man-opause.
Makes me act like a lunatic.

1753
01:13:30,148 --> 01:13:31,970
You know,
I get a little nutty.

1754
01:13:33,349 --> 01:13:34,974
Grandma Roz!
Grandma Roz!

1755
01:13:35,045 --> 01:13:36,060
My God.

1756
01:13:36,133 --> 01:13:40,224
There she is! My little scrunchie-munchie.
Let me look at you, baby.

1757
01:13:40,741 --> 01:13:43,774
Oh, you look so cute.
Do you mind if we sit down, honey?

1758
01:13:43,844 --> 01:13:46,332
Have a little chat.
'Cause Grandma's feet hurt.

1759
01:13:46,757 --> 01:13:51,263
So, I hear you're not
speaking to your father.

1760
01:13:51,332 --> 01:13:52,893
Is that true?

1761
01:13:52,965 --> 01:13:56,281
Well, let me tell you
something about men, Samantha.

1762
01:13:56,805 --> 01:14:01,540
They... They... They're told to
be tough and hard, you know?

1763
01:14:01,605 --> 01:14:05,314
But inside, they're quite soft and gooey.

1764
01:14:06,021 --> 01:14:08,192
Kind of like a cannoli.

1765
01:14:09,412 --> 01:14:11,551
A knish?
It's not exactly that.

1766
01:14:11,621 --> 01:14:15,101
It's more like peanut butter
and jelly inside burnt toast.

1767
01:14:17,573 --> 01:14:20,224
And once you know that,
you can cut them a little slack.

1768
01:14:20,484 --> 01:14:21,728
Besides, you'll have
plenty of time

1769
01:14:21,796 --> 01:14:23,007
to aggravate him
in your teens.

1770
01:14:23,077 --> 01:14:24,254
Grandma!

1771
01:14:24,324 --> 01:14:27,008
Hi, honey!
Look at you, how big you got!

1772
01:14:27,077 --> 01:14:28,484
Hi, sweetheart.

1773
01:14:28,549 --> 01:14:31,364
Come here and give me a Focker
sandwich. Okay, I'm the cheese.

1774
01:14:31,429 --> 01:14:32,989
- We're cheese!
- I'm the cheese.

1775
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:34,883
No, I'm the cheese
and you're the bread.

1776
01:14:34,949 --> 01:14:36,225
We're sourdough.

1777
01:14:36,644 --> 01:14:39,132
Attention! Attention!

1778
01:14:53,893 --> 01:14:56,893
Henry and Samantha!
Today you are five!

1779
01:15:02,661 --> 01:15:04,352
- This way.
- Okay, thank you.

1780
01:15:08,324 --> 01:15:09,339
Dad.

1781
01:15:09,892 --> 01:15:11,169
- Yeah.
- You coming?

1782
01:15:11,237 --> 01:15:12,644
Yeah. I just want
to practice the dance

1783
01:15:12,709 --> 01:15:14,051
I'm gonna surprise
your mother with.

1784
01:15:14,117 --> 01:15:15,065
Go ahead.

1785
01:15:15,141 --> 01:15:16,156
Okay. I'll see you
down there.

1786
01:15:16,229 --> 01:15:17,276
Gay?

1787
01:15:18,149 --> 01:15:20,287
My two cents.
The way to deal with Jack,

1788
01:15:20,356 --> 01:15:22,942
no matter what he does,
just smother that guy with kisses.

1789
01:15:23,013 --> 01:15:23,995
He'll be putty
in your hands.

1790
01:15:24,069 --> 01:15:25,017
Good.

1791
01:15:25,093 --> 01:15:26,653
- Love, love, love.
- Good, putty, thank you.

1792
01:15:26,724 --> 01:15:28,131
- Oh, Gay.
- Yes.

1793
01:15:29,796 --> 01:15:30,844
You look good.

1794
01:15:30,916 --> 01:15:31,898
Thank you.

1795
01:15:33,125 --> 01:15:34,270
All right.

1796
01:15:37,957 --> 01:15:39,298
- Can you do me a favor?
- Okay.

1797
01:15:39,365 --> 01:15:42,332
Can you just put this leg down
slowly? It's an old sex injury.

1798
01:15:42,405 --> 01:15:43,419
- Like this?
- Yeah.

1799
01:15:46,405 --> 01:15:47,353
Oh, my gosh.

1800
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:51,449
This performance
is my gift to you!

1801
01:15:52,197 --> 01:15:53,538
You are the chosen ones!

1802
01:15:53,604 --> 01:15:54,553
Pam.

1803
01:15:56,836 --> 01:15:58,298
- Pam!
- Greg.

1804
01:15:58,373 --> 01:16:00,282
I pronounce
this your day!

1805
01:16:00,357 --> 01:16:01,634
Oh, what happened to you?

1806
01:16:01,701 --> 01:16:03,227
Oh, it's... I...

1807
01:16:04,612 --> 01:16:06,270
I'll tell you
about it later, okay?

1808
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:08,283
Look, I'm really sorry
about what happened.

1809
01:16:08,356 --> 01:16:09,469
- I just...
- I'm sorry, too.

1810
01:16:09,541 --> 01:16:11,930
I let everything get out of
control and I shouldn't have.

1811
01:16:12,005 --> 01:16:13,565
It's just...
It's just your dad.

1812
01:16:13,637 --> 01:16:15,425
You know, I...
I know. He's insane.

1813
01:16:16,388 --> 01:16:18,243
Yes. Yes.

1814
01:16:19,493 --> 01:16:21,914
Listen to me.
We've got our own thing and it works.

1815
01:16:22,948 --> 01:16:24,061
It does, right?

1816
01:16:24,133 --> 01:16:26,304
Yeah, we actually kind of
know what we're doing.

1817
01:16:26,373 --> 01:16:27,966
- I love you.
- I love you.

1818
01:16:31,973 --> 01:16:34,274
Hey, Sam! Happy birthday.

1819
01:16:34,341 --> 01:16:35,835
Look, I know you don't
want to talk to me.

1820
01:16:35,909 --> 01:16:37,599
I just want you
to know that's okay.

1821
01:16:37,669 --> 01:16:39,457
I love you anyway.

1822
01:16:39,524 --> 01:16:40,506
I know, Daddy.

1823
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:45,562
Dad!

1824
01:16:45,636 --> 01:16:46,618
There he is!

1825
01:16:46,693 --> 01:16:48,548
Hey, happy birthday, man!

1826
01:16:48,613 --> 01:16:50,588
Hey, look, I think you
left something at home.

1827
01:16:52,356 --> 01:16:53,404
Arthur!

1828
01:16:53,476 --> 01:16:55,200
- Yeah.
- Thanks, Dad.

1829
01:17:01,541 --> 01:17:02,915
It's so beautiful.

1830
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:08,602
Oh, my God.

1831
01:17:08,676 --> 01:17:09,658
Oh, gosh.

1832
01:17:13,028 --> 01:17:14,305
I'm all right.

1833
01:17:14,373 --> 01:17:18,050
Gustavo! Birthday cake!
Birthday cake! Try the birthday cake.

1834
01:17:18,661 --> 01:17:20,352
There's 36 different kinds!

1835
01:17:28,773 --> 01:17:29,755
Kevin?

1836
01:17:29,829 --> 01:17:30,777
Rosalind.

1837
01:17:31,972 --> 01:17:34,394
What a mitzvah that you
could make it to the party.

1838
01:17:35,237 --> 01:17:36,317
What's wrong, honey?

1839
01:17:36,741 --> 01:17:37,886
I wish I knew.

1840
01:17:37,957 --> 01:17:39,298
Come. Sit down.

1841
01:17:41,797 --> 01:17:45,310
Look over this way a little bit.
And a little up. Up.

1842
01:17:46,532 --> 01:17:47,842
Hey, Jack.

1843
01:17:49,477 --> 01:17:51,517
Wow, that's great.
That's a great likeness.

1844
01:17:52,996 --> 01:17:54,458
That's really...

1845
01:17:54,533 --> 01:17:57,250
It really captured the
intensity and looks just like you.

1846
01:17:58,085 --> 01:17:59,295
All right.
So, look, last night,

1847
01:17:59,364 --> 01:18:01,339
I think we both said
some things we regret.

1848
01:18:01,413 --> 01:18:04,348
Maybe I shouldn't have
said anything about Dr. Bob.

1849
01:18:04,805 --> 01:18:07,740
But then you did that whole
course-correction thing. So...

1850
01:18:07,813 --> 01:18:11,074
Anyway,
"peace" of cake offering.

1851
01:18:17,765 --> 01:18:18,844
What the hell?

1852
01:18:21,861 --> 01:18:22,941
Oh, shit.

1853
01:18:23,749 --> 01:18:25,440
Jack, you all right?
Jack, I'm sorry.

1854
01:18:25,925 --> 01:18:27,070
Jack, you okay?

1855
01:18:28,549 --> 01:18:32,291
Okay, Focker. At least you're
going to make this a little fun.

1856
01:18:33,861 --> 01:18:36,250
Jack. Let's not do this.
Come on.

1857
01:18:36,773 --> 01:18:39,009
We've had this date
since the beginning, Greg.

1858
01:18:42,245 --> 01:18:44,482
All right. Let's dance.

1859
01:18:45,317 --> 01:18:46,495
Come on, man.

1860
01:19:05,989 --> 01:19:07,199
Jack?

1861
01:19:16,004 --> 01:19:17,498
Where are you? Jack!

1862
01:19:20,997 --> 01:19:22,077
Jack?

1863
01:19:28,357 --> 01:19:32,612
Get out of the ball pit!
Get out of the ball pit! Get out!

1864
01:19:32,965 --> 01:19:34,045
Let's go.

1865
01:19:34,117 --> 01:19:35,972
Get out!
Get out of the ball pit!

1866
01:19:36,324 --> 01:19:37,470
Get out!

1867
01:19:39,941 --> 01:19:40,988
Jack?

1868
01:19:51,684 --> 01:19:53,986
I saw you last night
with Andi Garcia!

1869
01:19:54,981 --> 01:19:56,158
Nothing happened!

1870
01:19:58,341 --> 01:19:59,770
I've been in the wild
for so long,

1871
01:19:59,845 --> 01:20:01,252
that maybe
it's time to come home.

1872
01:20:01,317 --> 01:20:02,779
But then where is home?

1873
01:20:02,852 --> 01:20:05,405
Honey, home is
inside of you.

1874
01:20:05,476 --> 01:20:09,022
What you have been seeking
out there is right in here.

1875
01:20:09,508 --> 01:20:11,166
- In your heart?
- No, in your heart.

1876
01:20:11,236 --> 01:20:12,218
In my heart.

1877
01:20:12,292 --> 01:20:13,340
Yes, yes, Kevin.

1878
01:20:30,084 --> 01:20:31,262
Suck it!

1879
01:20:34,085 --> 01:20:38,362
Arthur? Arthur?
Mom! Arthur's missing!

1880
01:20:53,989 --> 01:20:55,811
Jack! Nothing happened.

1881
01:20:57,285 --> 01:20:59,107
- What'd you say?
- Jack, nothing happened.

1882
01:20:59,173 --> 01:21:00,700
I'm telling you the truth.

1883
01:21:01,701 --> 01:21:02,945
Oh, shit.

1884
01:21:05,860 --> 01:21:08,610
Jinxy! Jinxy!
Bad cat! Bad cat!

1885
01:21:09,381 --> 01:21:10,974
Jinx! Bad cat!

1886
01:21:11,877 --> 01:21:13,022
Jinx!

1887
01:21:14,533 --> 01:21:15,940
Jinx! Jinx!

1888
01:21:16,868 --> 01:21:18,079
Oh, shit.

1889
01:21:18,788 --> 01:21:21,636
Kevin, you are
a lovely young man

1890
01:21:21,701 --> 01:21:25,378
with a number of unusual
fixations and hobbies.

1891
01:21:25,445 --> 01:21:26,394
Thank you.

1892
01:21:26,468 --> 01:21:27,548
I know you're
going to find your way.

1893
01:21:27,621 --> 01:21:30,174
Trust me, honey.
Because you have the strength of a lion

1894
01:21:30,245 --> 01:21:32,067
and the soul of a poet.

1895
01:21:36,709 --> 01:21:37,821
Roz?

1896
01:21:39,141 --> 01:21:41,443
Bernie?
What are you doing here?

1897
01:21:42,725 --> 01:21:43,870
What are you doing here?

1898
01:21:43,941 --> 01:21:45,021
The guy has
issues, honey.

1899
01:21:45,093 --> 01:21:47,460
Bernard, I swear this isn't
what it looks like.

1900
01:21:47,525 --> 01:21:50,045
Your wife was comforting me
in a moment of distress

1901
01:21:50,116 --> 01:21:52,058
and my soul just
reached out to her.

1902
01:21:52,132 --> 01:21:53,343
Your soul or your tongue?

1903
01:21:53,413 --> 01:21:54,623
No. There was
no tongue involved.

1904
01:21:54,693 --> 01:21:55,871
There was a little.

1905
01:21:55,941 --> 01:21:57,217
Thank you for your honesty.

1906
01:21:57,284 --> 01:22:00,099
I thought you were in Spain,
honey. What happened?

1907
01:22:00,164 --> 01:22:01,179
What happened?

1908
01:22:01,253 --> 01:22:03,871
I went halfway around the
world to master the flamenco,

1909
01:22:03,941 --> 01:22:05,599
but there was
one thing missing,

1910
01:22:06,340 --> 01:22:07,715
my dance partner.

1911
01:22:08,229 --> 01:22:09,538
Oh, Bernie.

1912
01:22:09,893 --> 01:22:11,234
You're my true north.

1913
01:22:11,973 --> 01:22:14,307
I know as long as we're
together, I'll never get lost.

1914
01:22:14,372 --> 01:22:16,576
Oh, what a beautiful line.

1915
01:22:17,061 --> 01:22:18,337
Come here, baby.

1916
01:22:19,205 --> 01:22:22,653
That's beautiful.
So raw, this electricity...

1917
01:22:22,725 --> 01:22:25,114
Will you get out of here
so I can shtup my wife?

1918
01:22:25,189 --> 01:22:26,171
Shtup her? Yeah, sure.

1919
01:22:27,237 --> 01:22:28,317
Jinx!

1920
01:22:28,389 --> 01:22:30,112
Grandpa! Grandpa!
What's wrong?

1921
01:22:30,949 --> 01:22:31,963
Jack?

1922
01:22:32,037 --> 01:22:33,793
Jack. Jack.

1923
01:22:33,861 --> 01:22:34,843
Jack.

1924
01:22:35,492 --> 01:22:36,703
Honey. Greg, do something.

1925
01:22:36,773 --> 01:22:38,202
- Okay. Having some chest pain?
- Yeah.

1926
01:22:38,277 --> 01:22:39,870
All right. Just relax.
I'm gonna check you out.

1927
01:22:39,940 --> 01:22:41,347
What's wrong with Grandpa?

1928
01:22:41,413 --> 01:22:42,787
He's gonna
be fine, honey.

1929
01:22:42,853 --> 01:22:45,700
Okay, I'm here. Okay.

1930
01:22:45,765 --> 01:22:47,739
Jack, you have your
nitro tabs with you?

1931
01:22:47,812 --> 01:22:49,601
Greg, he's not responding
to my treatment.

1932
01:22:49,669 --> 01:22:52,931
Really? To you waving your hands over
him? He's not a Ouija board, Kevin.

1933
01:22:52,997 --> 01:22:54,077
Pam? Call 911.

1934
01:22:54,149 --> 01:22:55,163
Okay.

1935
01:22:55,236 --> 01:22:57,091
Kevin, can you go up to the house,
see if you have some aspirin?

1936
01:22:57,156 --> 01:22:58,138
Aspirin.

1937
01:22:58,213 --> 01:22:59,260
It's all right.

1938
01:23:00,325 --> 01:23:01,405
Jinx!

1939
01:23:07,108 --> 01:23:08,537
- Arthur!
- Wow.

1940
01:23:09,381 --> 01:23:10,723
Thanks, Dad.

1941
01:23:13,509 --> 01:23:15,898
Just relax, Jack.
It's going to be okay.

1942
01:23:15,973 --> 01:23:17,380
Breathe, breathe.

1943
01:23:18,149 --> 01:23:19,425
I promise.

1944
01:23:21,189 --> 01:23:22,716
Is he taking
any other medications?

1945
01:23:25,317 --> 01:23:27,259
Just the 324
milligrams of aspirin

1946
01:23:27,332 --> 01:23:28,958
I gave him about
15 minutes ago.

1947
01:23:29,029 --> 01:23:31,396
Thank you, nurse. You did good.
We'll take it from here.

1948
01:23:31,461 --> 01:23:32,923
By the way,
how'd you guys come by

1949
01:23:32,997 --> 01:23:34,426
all these bruises
and lacerations?

1950
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:36,605
Oh, it's a long story.

1951
01:23:36,676 --> 01:23:39,393
We were in the bouncy castle,
and then he tripped, and...

1952
01:23:39,460 --> 01:23:42,046
I get it.
My father-in-law tripped

1953
01:23:42,117 --> 01:23:44,670
through a plate glass window
at my wedding last year.

1954
01:23:45,445 --> 01:23:46,525
All right.
Let's get him loaded up.

1955
01:23:47,844 --> 01:23:49,437
Don't worry.
We'll take care of your husband.

1956
01:23:49,508 --> 01:23:51,930
We're gonna follow behind
you in the car. All right?

1957
01:23:52,549 --> 01:23:53,497
Greg.

1958
01:23:54,885 --> 01:23:57,787
I know you were telling
the truth about Andi, Greg.

1959
01:23:57,861 --> 01:23:59,355
- Really?
- Yeah.

1960
01:24:00,164 --> 01:24:02,586
The pulse on your carotid
artery remained steady

1961
01:24:02,661 --> 01:24:04,068
as you pleaded
your innocence.

1962
01:24:04,997 --> 01:24:06,306
Right, of course.

1963
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:08,991
- And, Greg.
- Yeah.

1964
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:12,737
It was never going to be
Dr. Bob. It was you.

1965
01:24:13,573 --> 01:24:14,587
It was always you.

1966
01:24:14,661 --> 01:24:16,963
You just relax and
stay quiet, Mr. Byrnes.

1967
01:24:17,029 --> 01:24:18,589
I'll see you
over there. Okay?

1968
01:24:18,660 --> 01:24:20,067
...Focker.

1969
01:24:20,517 --> 01:24:21,761
Why is he cursing at us?

1970
01:24:21,829 --> 01:24:23,422
Hey, we are trying
to help you, sir.

1971
01:24:23,493 --> 01:24:25,020
What? What?

1972
01:24:27,589 --> 01:24:29,411
You're the Greg Focker.

1973
01:24:29,797 --> 01:24:31,324
I'm sorry, what?

1974
01:24:31,877 --> 01:24:35,139
You're the...
You're the Greg Focker.

1975
01:24:38,405 --> 01:24:40,096
I'm the Greg Focker.

1976
01:24:45,925 --> 01:24:48,642
Okay. Okay.

1977
01:24:50,053 --> 01:24:51,035
Okay.

1978
01:24:51,109 --> 01:24:52,669
Let's get him up.

1979
01:25:17,541 --> 01:25:18,882
One more.
I need more. I need more.

1980
01:25:18,949 --> 01:25:19,963
One more, one more.

1981
01:25:20,037 --> 01:25:21,019
No, I need more.

1982
01:25:21,508 --> 01:25:22,686
- Another present.
- Here.

1983
01:25:22,821 --> 01:25:23,999
Best Chistmakkah ever.

1984
01:25:24,548 --> 01:25:25,825
This is a very
special gift, guys.

1985
01:25:25,893 --> 01:25:26,940
One more, cool!

1986
01:25:27,557 --> 01:25:28,931
What is it,
Grandpa Bernie?

1987
01:25:28,996 --> 01:25:30,589
I've had it with me
my entire life.

1988
01:25:30,660 --> 01:25:32,668
It's my own original
whoopee cushion.

1989
01:25:32,740 --> 01:25:34,497
- What does it do?
- Are you kidding me?

1990
01:25:34,565 --> 01:25:35,972
Jack, lift up your leg.

1991
01:25:37,573 --> 01:25:38,817
Jack, come on.

1992
01:25:42,597 --> 01:25:44,026
Disgusting!

1993
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:45,311
It farts!

1994
01:25:45,957 --> 01:25:48,772
Jack, we have to laugh at the
stuff that makes us human, right?

1995
01:25:48,837 --> 01:25:50,942
Gas, burps.
Picking noses?

1996
01:25:51,237 --> 01:25:53,440
You kids want to pick your nose
and flick your boogers, do it.

1997
01:25:53,509 --> 01:25:54,523
Hey, Bernie.

1998
01:25:54,597 --> 01:25:56,004
But do it only
when it's dry.

1999
01:25:56,068 --> 01:25:57,410
- Don't do a wet one.
- I have something for Jack.

2000
01:25:57,477 --> 01:25:58,426
Take that to your room.

2001
01:25:58,500 --> 01:25:59,449
It's what makes life, life!

2002
01:25:59,525 --> 01:26:01,051
I know. I know.
Here, Jack,

2003
01:26:01,124 --> 01:26:03,994
this is a little something
from Bernie and me to you.

2004
01:26:04,069 --> 01:26:05,475
Oh, how thoughtful.
Thank you.

2005
01:26:05,541 --> 01:26:06,970
It is a very
thoughtful gift.

2006
01:26:07,044 --> 01:26:07,993
It was your idea.

2007
01:26:08,069 --> 01:26:09,149
I know.

2008
01:26:09,637 --> 01:26:11,011
- What's this?
- What is that?

2009
01:26:11,076 --> 01:26:13,531
That is your own
personal yarmulke!

2010
01:26:13,989 --> 01:26:15,004
Jack.

2011
01:26:15,076 --> 01:26:16,483
One of those
little Jewish hats.

2012
01:26:17,221 --> 01:26:18,399
Cute.

2013
01:26:18,469 --> 01:26:20,738
We know that you're
into that genealogy stuff.

2014
01:26:20,805 --> 01:26:22,747
So, when I was
nursing you back to health,

2015
01:26:22,821 --> 01:26:24,992
I took the opportunity,
when you were taking a nap,

2016
01:26:25,061 --> 01:26:26,719
of snipping
a couple of your pubes

2017
01:26:26,788 --> 01:26:29,374
and I sent it to one of
those DNA testing sites.

2018
01:26:29,445 --> 01:26:30,459
You did what?

2019
01:26:30,532 --> 01:26:33,347
We thought it'd be fun to trace
your lineage all the way back.

2020
01:26:33,412 --> 01:26:35,354
Yes. And it turns out,
Jack T. Byrnes,

2021
01:26:35,428 --> 01:26:37,435
that you are
one twenty-third Israelite!

2022
01:26:37,989 --> 01:26:39,996
Welcome to the tribe, Jack!

2023
01:26:40,069 --> 01:26:42,436
While I dispute the findings,
I appreciate the gesture.

2024
01:26:42,501 --> 01:26:43,646
Thank you, Bernard, Roz.

2025
01:26:43,716 --> 01:26:44,796
You're welcome, Ya'akov.

2026
01:26:44,869 --> 01:26:46,331
- Your Hebrew name.
- Ya'akov.

2027
01:26:46,404 --> 01:26:47,779
- Ya'akov.
- Ya'akov.

2028
01:26:47,845 --> 01:26:48,925
Two A's.

2029
01:26:48,997 --> 01:26:50,785
Well, listen, Greg,
we're in your home

2030
01:26:51,685 --> 01:26:54,205
and you're in charge here,
so why don't you lead us in a toast?

2031
01:26:54,276 --> 01:26:55,738
Right.

2032
01:26:55,813 --> 01:26:58,180
Honestly, Jack,
I have no desire

2033
01:26:58,245 --> 01:26:59,259
to try and sound like I am

2034
01:26:59,332 --> 01:27:01,721
in any way in charge of
anything in this house.

2035
01:27:02,245 --> 01:27:04,798
But I do love our family
very, very much.

2036
01:27:04,869 --> 01:27:09,342
And I'm really happy that we can all
be here together for the weekend.

2037
01:27:10,213 --> 01:27:13,147
Then we'll part ways and you
guys will return to your homes

2038
01:27:13,221 --> 01:27:14,748
in your own respective states. Cheers.

2039
01:27:14,821 --> 01:27:16,031
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

2040
01:27:16,101 --> 01:27:19,101
Actually, sweetheart,
your dad and I have a little...

2041
01:27:19,173 --> 01:27:21,278
Gaylord, we're moving
to Chicago.

2042
01:27:22,468 --> 01:27:24,356
No, we're serious.
We sold Focker Isle.

2043
01:27:24,421 --> 01:27:27,236
We just bought the house two
doors down. Isn't that great?

2044
01:27:27,301 --> 01:27:29,275
- No, that's not great.
- Oh, no, if they're moving here,

2045
01:27:29,348 --> 01:27:30,559
- then we're moving here.
- Good!

2046
01:27:30,629 --> 01:27:31,741
We'll live together,
one big happy family.

2047
01:27:31,813 --> 01:27:32,828
We should discuss this.

2048
01:27:32,901 --> 01:27:34,788
No. No. No. Jack,

2049
01:27:34,852 --> 01:27:36,674
nobody's moving because
nobody's moving. Right?

2050
01:27:36,741 --> 01:27:39,196
How else are the kids gonna be
Fockerized if we don't live here?

2051
01:27:39,269 --> 01:27:41,407
No. Nobody's going
to be Fockerized.

2052
01:27:41,476 --> 01:27:42,883
- No.
- Why not?

2053
01:27:45,220 --> 01:27:48,254
This Google is a
wonderful tool, Jinxy cat.

2054
01:27:49,733 --> 01:27:52,602
Don't tell anyone, but I'm
going to do a search on myself.

2055
01:28:09,829 --> 01:28:10,941
Come on. Who needs
something like this?

2056
01:28:11,013 --> 01:28:14,013
Who's the target demo
for a drug like Sustengo?

2057
01:28:14,085 --> 01:28:16,834
And I got to say it's
somebody like my father-in-law.

2058
01:28:16,900 --> 01:28:19,803
His name is Jack Byrnes.
You know, he had a heart attack

2059
01:28:19,876 --> 01:28:23,292
and he called me up, he said,
"Greg, I've had a heart attack."

2060
01:28:23,364 --> 01:28:24,542
Now, I said,
"First of all, Jack,

2061
01:28:24,613 --> 01:28:26,239
"don't you have to have a
heart to get one of those?"

2062
01:28:27,493 --> 01:28:30,428
First weekend I ever met him,
he said to me, he said,

2063
01:28:30,501 --> 01:28:35,389
"Hey, listen, keep your snake in
its cage for the next 72 hours."

2064
01:28:35,973 --> 01:28:37,020
I didn't say it like that.

2065
01:28:37,093 --> 01:28:38,882
All right.
Maybe somebody's had their snake

2066
01:28:38,949 --> 01:28:41,437
in their cage for
about 30 years! Okay.

2067
01:28:44,709 --> 01:28:46,302
Remix. What's a remix?

2068
01:28:46,373 --> 01:28:48,282
You know, the guy is
definitely obsessed...

2069
01:28:48,389 --> 01:28:50,014

Jack, Jack Byrnes

2076
01:29:00,644 --> 01:29:02,335
Talk about sexual frustration

2077
01:29:02,405 --> 01:29:03,452
Byrnes

2078
01:29:03,524 --> 01:29:05,597
Obsessed with boobs
He can breast feed his grandson

2079
01:29:05,669 --> 01:29:06,617

Mannary gland
Couple of tugs off the thing himself

2081
01:29:09,284 --> 01:29:10,233
Hey, Focker

2082
01:29:10,309 --> 01:29:11,454
I never did that.

2083
01:29:11,525 --> 01:29:13,150
Hey, Focker, I got nipples
Okay

2084
01:29:13,221 --> 01:29:14,683
Hey, Focker, I got nipples
Wow

2085
01:29:14,757 --> 01:29:16,283
Can you milk me?

2086
01:29:16,356 --> 01:29:17,949
Circle of trust
goes round and round

2087
01:29:18,021 --> 01:29:19,712

2088
