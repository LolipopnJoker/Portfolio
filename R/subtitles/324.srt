1
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,250
A-ha!

2
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,407
Eh?

3
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,727
"Booby Traps"?

4
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,530
Ah...

5
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,644
Oh, there you are, my lovely.

6
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,369
Hmm! What's that?

7
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,086
Take the book?

8
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,560
I don't mind if I do.

9
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,686
At last, it is mine.

10
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,406
Finally, you are mine.

11
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,405
All right. Let's do this. Bare knuckles.

12
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,722
Bring it on, skinny.
You don't scare me.

13
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,524
You got any sevens?

14
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,090
Go fish.

15
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,285
Is that all you got?

16
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,721
Ooh.

17
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,246
Hmm.

18
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,806
Man, this is way overdue.

19
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,564
"Once upon a time, under the sea,

20
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,849
"there was a little town
called Bikini Bottom.

21
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,763
<i>"In this town, there was a place</i>

22
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,569
<i>"called The Krusty Krab,</i>

23
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,369
<i>"where folks would come to eat a thing</i>

24
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,602
<i>"called the Krabby Patty.</i>

25
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,730
<i>"Every greasy spoon has a fry cook,
and the one who worked here</i>

26
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,049
<i>"was named SpongeBob SquarePants."</i>

27
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,722
<i>Who lives
in a pineapple under the sea?</i>

28
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,484
<i>SpongeBob SquarePants!</i>

29
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,762
<i>- Absorbent and yellow and porous is he</i>
- Just hold it. Hold it.

30
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,569
<i>SpongeBob SquarePants!</i>

31
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,642
<i>If nautical nonsense
be something you wish</i>

32
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,768
<i>SpongeBob SquarePants!</i>

33
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,763
<i>Then drop on the deck
and flop like a fish</i>

34
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,842
<i>SpongeBob SquarePants!</i>

35
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,161
Stop!

36
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,000
Huh?

37
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,440
There's only one thing worse

38
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,363
than talking birds, and that would be...

39
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,646
Singing birds!

40
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,327
Okay, I promise not to si-i-i-ng.

41
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,326
Take it from us.

42
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,880
He really does hate singing birds.

43
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,288
Just keep weading.
Pwease, Mr. Piwate, sir.

44
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,121
Come closer while I tell you the tale.

45
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,887
- Okay, start reading.
- No. Not that close!

46
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,083
Yeah. Hmm.

47
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,000
All right, here we go.

48
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,090
Now, SpongeBob loved his job

49
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,003
as a fly cook...

50
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,809
<i>...more than anything.</i>

51
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,281
<i>And that is saying a lot</i>

52
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,881
<i>because he loved everything!</i>

53
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,481
<i>He loved his pet snail, Gary.</i>

54
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,244
<i>He loved his best friend, Patrick.</i>

55
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,328
<i>He loved blowing bubbles</i>

56
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,328
<i>- and jellyfishing.</i>
- Whee!

57
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,449
<i>He loved making Krabby Patties</i>

58
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,602
<i>for the folks of Bikini Bottom</i>

59
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,331
<i>just as much as they loved eating them.</i>

60
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,845
<i>Why, you may ask,</i>

61
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,969
<i>do they love this
greasy little sandwich so much?</i>

62
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,327
<i>Why did they eat them for breakfast...</i>

63
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,890
<i>...lunch,</i>

64
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,961
<i>and dinner,</i>

65
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,691
<i>despite their doctor's warnings?</i>

66
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,285
He'll be gone in a week.

67
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,721
Oh, Harold!

68
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,124
<i>Oh. It was a secret.</i>

69
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,004
<i>No one was sure what was</i>

70
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,686
<i>in these patties
that made them so delicious.</i>

71
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,410
<i>And, frankly, no one cared,</i>

72
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,528
<i>- except for Plankton.</i>
- Meh.

73
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,001
<i>Plankton owned a restaurant
right across the street</i>

74
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,206
<i>from The Krusty Krab,</i>

75
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,520
<i>where no one ate</i>

76
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,489
<i>because the food was really bad.</i>

77
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,289
Now, is that really necessary?

78
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,923
<i>Plankton
had made it his life's work</i>

79
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,206
<i>to steal the recipe.</i>

80
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,727
SpongeBob, please, let's talk about this!

81
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,963
<i>And SpongeBob was
always there to protect it.</i>

82
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,807
<i>But today, things</i>

83
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,011
<i>would be different.</i>

84
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,610
Good morning, SpongeBob!

85
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,806
Morning, Patrick!

86
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,689
You here for
your pre-lunch Krabby Patty?

87
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,444
I'm getting two today.

88
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,729
One for me and one for my friend.

89
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,643
Oh. Have I met this friend?

90
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,643
"You know me, SpongeBob."

91
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,129
Enjoy, Patrick's tummy.

92
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,766
Thirteen,

93
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,968
fourteen, fifteen...

94
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,565
Hey, Mr. Krabs, I thought we got

95
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,404
our tartar sauce delivery on Thursday.

96
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,726
Tartar...

97
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,921
Sauce?

98
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,411
Bull's-eye!

99
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,001
Plankton!

100
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,691
So it's a food fight he wants, eh?

101
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,490
Welcome to Air Plankton.

102
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,927
Please put your seat backs
and tray tables up

103
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,526
as we're now approaching
our final destination.

104
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,566
Okay, Patrick, load the potatoes!

105
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,610
Mashed or scalloped, sir?

106
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,489
No, Patrick. Raw.

107
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,766
Sir, yes, sir!

108
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,722
Locked and loaded!

109
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,808
Don't worry, little formuler,
you'll be safe in this,

110
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,166
uh, safe.

111
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,046
Fire!

112
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,960
Potatoes?

113
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,565
He's closing in!

114
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,723
I think we have a few minutes
before he gets here.

115
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,842
He's right on top of us!

116
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,765
Hey, it's raining fries!

117
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,083
It's gonna take a lot more than
potatoes to bring this baby down.

118
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,281
Or maybe not.

119
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,207
Whoo!

120
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,489
Wait a minute,
Patrick, look! He's got a tank!

121
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,122
Well, Krabs, you're certainly
in a pickle now!

122
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,481
Hey, it's raining pickles!

123
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,205
Now it's raining...

124
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,045
Tanks.

125
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,440
You're welcome!

126
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,007
Finland.

127
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,361
Your orders, sir!

128
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,046
I'll have two
Krabby Patties-extra ketchup,

129
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,327
extra mustard, and hold the mayo.

130
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,726
Wrong channel!

131
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,166
Your orders, sir!

132
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,926
Extra ketchup! Extra mustard!
Hold the mayo!

133
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,161
Yes, sir!

134
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,005
Extra ketchup! Extra mustard!

135
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,246
Hold the mayo!

136
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,884
Unleash the condiments!

137
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,564
With relish.

138
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,404
Excuse me.

139
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,161
Hello?

140
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,687
Hello?

141
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,922
<i>- Guess y'all don't want my money.</i>
- Money?

142
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,684
Thank you! Come again!

143
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,208
I can't hold the mayo any longer!

144
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:06,205
Mayo? Well, it's going to
take a lot more than mayo to stop...

145
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,366
Now what?

146
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,286
Oh!

147
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,045
I just remembered,
I don't work for Mr. Krabs!

148
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,844
Robot! Robot!

149
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,281
Robot! Giant robot!

150
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,363
Robot! Robot!

151
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,962
Mr. Krabs, Plankton's here
and he's got a giant robot!

152
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,485
Quick, boy, bar the door!

153
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,006
Got it!

154
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,240
I'll take one secret formula...

155
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,329
...to go.

156
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,251
Oh, barnacles. I'm out of gas?

157
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,843
I'm not through yet.

158
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,766
I've got something that will make
you hand over that formula.

159
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,286
Something you can't resist.

160
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,363
Money!

161
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,010
Yes! Huh?

162
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,124
That's... That's... That's impossible!

163
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,527
Well, it was full of money just last week.

164
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,889
And then
I bought that airplane and built that tank.

165
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,200
Sounds to me like

166
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,126
someone's just a wee bit broke!

167
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,964
Well, Krabs, I guess you've won.

168
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,806
I've spent every penny I've ever made
trying to put you out of business.

169
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,646
Except this one.
My last penny.

170
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,610
Besides, what can I do
with one measly cent anyway?

171
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,882
You could give it to me.
Just a suggestion.

172
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,564
Here, take it.

173
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,485
You've taken everything else. Why not?

174
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,247
Well, Plankton,
like a reheated Krabby Patty,

175
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,527
you've been foiled again.

176
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,445
I guess this means the secret formula
is safe forever, right, Mr. Krabs?

177
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,045
It sure does, boy.

178
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,683
Why don't you scurry along?

179
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,411
Thanks for coming! Have a nice day!

180
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,531
He's been out there
crying for 20 minutes.

181
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,921
Pathetic.

182
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,970
I'm just going to
go out there and gloat a little.

183
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,810
Cyclops to Laptop. Come in, Laptop.

184
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,202
<i>"Laptop." You do realize
that nickname is demeaning?</i>

185
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,204
<i>I have twice the processing
power of a laptop.</i>

186
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,125
Never mind.
Maintain radio silence.

187
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,686
Finally!

188
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,886
Huh?

189
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,531
A pressure plate, eh, Krabs?

190
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,090
Amateur hour.

191
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,640
Hmm.

192
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,801
Perfect!

193
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,325
Not a bad likeness.

194
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,246
Good enough to fool that idiot Krabs.

195
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,368
Easy, easy.

196
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,370
Plankton's broke!
Ooh-ooh.

197
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,169
Look at Mr. Krabs go.

198
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,208
I've never seen him
gloat this hard before.

199
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,450
Hey, well, Plankton,

200
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,091
me bunions are telling me
it's time to stop gloating.

201
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,687
Huh? Looks like you're
falling apart at the seams.

202
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,201
- Huh?
- Poor me.

203
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,931
- Sob, <i>sob.</i>
- A robot?

204
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,564
Plankton?

205
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,321
Uh-oh.

206
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,329
That ain't good.

207
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,443
<i>Initiating lockdown sequence.</i>

208
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,965
Me formuler!

209
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,404
Huh? Ow!

210
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,247
No, no, no! No!

211
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,970
Squidward! Open up!

212
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,930
Ha-ha, victory dance. Boo-ya.

213
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,531
Give me that!

214
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,524
Come on, SpongeBob, join me!

215
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,802
And we'll be rich and powerful,

216
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,450
until I eventually betray you.

217
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,967
- Uh, join me!
- No! Never!

218
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,122
I'm on Team Krabs for life!

219
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,123
Plankton!

220
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,768
What? Where'd it go?

221
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,241
<i>Wait a minute.
Molecular deconstruction?</i>

222
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,529
<i>I proved that to be a
scientific impossibility seven times!</i>

223
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,409
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

224
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,086
<i>I think I forgot to empty
Gary's litter box today.</i>

225
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,251
Where's me formuler, Plankton?

226
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,971
I... I don't know! It just disappeared!

227
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,168
Why should I believe you, you lying liar?

228
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,924
Normally, I'd agree with you, Mr. Krabs,

229
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,606
but this time he's telling
the truth. It just vanished!

230
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,250
It's true!

231
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,531
Mr. Krabs, I'm telling you he's innocent!

232
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,170
What are you going to do, Krabs?

233
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,606
Pour hot oil on me?

234
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,762
Or put bamboo shoots under my nails?

235
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,691
No. Knock, knock.

236
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,321
Knock-knock jokes?
I can do this all day, Krabs.

237
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,726
Knock, knock.

238
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,008
Oh, boy. Who's there?

239
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,201
Jimmy.

240
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,521
Jimmy who?

241
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,730
Jimmy back my formuler, Plankton!

242
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,771
Well, that's stupid, but how is it torture?

243
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,361
You'll see.

244
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,209
"Jimmy back my formula"?

245
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,130
Hmm.

246
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,407
Oh!

247
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,050
I get it!

248
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,490
Oh, make it stop, Krabs! Make it stop!

249
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,927
Mr. Krabs? SpongeBob, zip it!

250
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,288
Thank you, Squidward.

251
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,963
The customers are getting restless!

252
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,451
They're asking for

253
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,403
refunds.

254
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,127
Refunds.

255
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,809
Refunds?

256
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,769
Refund! Refund!

257
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,048
Listen up, boy. Get in there

258
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,487
and make me customers
some Krabby Patties!

259
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,688
All right, Plankton... Huh?

260
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,002
SpongeBob! What's wrong, boy?

261
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,481
We're out of Krabby Patties?

262
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,810
How can we make more Krabby
Patties without the secret formula?

263
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,281
You've got to have that
formuler memorized by now!

264
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,691
But as you are aware, sir,

265
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,081
the employee handbook
clearly states, and I quote,

266
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,446
"No employee may, in part or in whole,

267
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,971
"commit the Krabby Patty secret formula

268
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,371
"to any recorded written or visual form,

269
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,050
"including memories, dreams,
and/or needlepoint."

270
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,762
Curse you, fine print!

271
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,525
Refund! Refund! Refund!

272
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,045
Stop!

273
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,764
I'm not your enemy!

274
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,888
Plankton is your enemy!

275
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,201
So is he an anemone or a plankton?

276
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,801
Well, someone had to do it.

277
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,121
But Mr. Krabs...

278
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,441
He took this from you!

279
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,570
- Krabby Patty...
- I can almost taste it.

280
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,211
Uh, Mr. Krabs,
Plankton didn't take the secret formula.

281
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,964
Not now, SpongeBob!

282
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,369
Hey! I ordered a double Krabby Patty!

283
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,570
So join me! Help get the formuler back,

284
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,885
and I'll give each
and every one of you a free Krabby Patty!

285
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,085
Oh, no! Wait!

286
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,845
Even better, a slight discount!

287
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,451
To The Chum Bucket!

288
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,010
But he didn't do it.

289
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,766
I had it right
in my greedy little mitts,

290
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,285
and then... Poof!

291
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,365
And now it's gone. Gone forever.

292
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,683
Oh, I was so close to
gaining the people's respect-slash-fear.

293
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,126
<i>Um, Plankton?</i>

294
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,046
Oh, when will my
frustration-slash-humiliation end?

295
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,122
<i>- Plankton?</i>
- Not now, hon!

296
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,884
I'm ranting-slash-raving.

297
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,365
All right, what is it?

298
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,001
<i>Well, I was trying to tell you
there's an angry mob outside.</i>

299
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,681
<i>But now they're inside.</i>

300
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,205
Oh.

301
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,047
- Hmm?
<i>- I just work here.</i>

302
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,561
We'd like to have a word with you!

303
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,722
You all look very hungry.

304
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,890
Can I get anybody a Chum Burger?

305
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,600
Enough with
the niceties, Plankton!

306
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,724
This is the last time
I'm going to ask you.

307
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,922
Where is me formuler?

308
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,641
I told you, Krabs, I don't have it.

309
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,410
Wrong answer.

310
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,084
Stop!

311
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,967
All right, Mr. Krabs,
let me get in on this.

312
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,843
What's going on around here?

313
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,242
You may want to
step back a little, Mr. Krabs.

314
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,367
This could get messy.

315
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,606
Let's hope so.

316
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,401
So you won't talk, eh, Plankton?

317
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,642
I didn't want to have to do this.

318
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,485
Plankton, here comes the pain.

319
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,843
Soap in the eye, eh? Diabolical!

320
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,607
No! Stop! Don't!

321
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,123
Wait. That didn't look painful.

322
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,642
Mr. Krabs, you may not
understand what I'm about to do today,

323
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,290
but someday we'll look back
and have a good laugh.

324
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,046
Wait a minute.

325
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,963
Hey, they're getting away!

326
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,970
Sorry, Mr. Krabs!

327
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,131
So, you've been running
a long con on me, eh?

328
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,889
All these years you've been
working for Plankton!

329
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,365
They're in cahoots!

330
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,482
Yeah, I guess that's
a short way of saying it.

331
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,244
Stop that bubble!

332
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,721
Please tell me there's
something soft below me.

333
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,881
Mmm, nope.

334
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,648
SpongeBob!

335
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,891
Oh. You were like
an underpaid son to me.

336
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,089
I would've expected Squidward
to stab me in the back.

337
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,281
Huh? What? Huh?

338
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,566
But SpongeBob?

339
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,611
Me most trusted employee?
Working with me sworn enemy?

340
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,490
You know what this means,
Mr. Squidward.

341
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,920
We get the rest of the day off?

342
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,001
No!

343
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,687
This be but a harbinger
of what I fear lies ahead.

344
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,370
For you. For me.

345
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,170
For all of Bikini Bottom!

346
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,846
The Krabby Patty
is what ties us all together!

347
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:07,562
Without it, there will be
a complete breakdown of social order.

348
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,320
A war of all against all!

349
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,211
Dark times are ahead.

350
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,325
Dark times indeed!

351
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,881
Seriously?

352
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,888
Aren't you overreacting a bit?

353
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,927
Huh?

354
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,401
Welcome to the apocalypse,
Mr. Squidward.

355
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,008
I hope you like leather.

356
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,850
I prefer suede.

357
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,962
And so
Bikini Bottom became

358
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,046
an apocalyptic cesspool forevermore.

359
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,760
The end.

360
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,244
Wait a minute. That's a terrible ending.

361
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,647
- Oh, this is bad. Really bad.
- What? What?

362
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,927
SpongeBob's in trouble
and the story's over?

363
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,889
Ouch. Ouch. Ouch.

364
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,570
Hey, call a therapist!

365
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,331
I have anxiety!

366
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,402
There is no way that
that's the end of this story.

367
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,365
Of course it is. I'll show you.

368
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,487
Just turn around.

369
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,050
Oh, all right.

370
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,088
Hey!

371
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,128
I need that to fly, you jerk.

372
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,040
"The

373
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,446
"End"!

374
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,286
<i>That's not the end!</i>

375
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,846
Of course it is!

376
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,968
- Unhand that book!
- You let go of that!

377
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,485
Let go, you numbskull!

378
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,081
You better keep reading, Mr. Pirate,

379
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,921
or else!

380
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:41,245
I know I shouldn't be
littering, but that ending was rubbish!

381
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,804
Rubbish!

382
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,687
Good morning, Squidward.
I'll have the usual.

383
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,610
With cheese.

384
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,603
We're out of Krabby Patties right now!

385
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,206
No Krabby Patties?

386
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,007
No!

387
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,164
Look what's become of Bikini Bottom.

388
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,841
We've really gotta get that formula back.

389
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:20,561
Hmm. Get the secret formula, you say?

390
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,610
Excuse me, I need a moment.

391
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,407
With that formula, I could rule the world!

392
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,050
You know I can hear you, right?

393
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,122
Well, what do we do now?

394
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,249
Now we work together.
You know, teamwork.

395
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,561
What's, uh, "tee-am work"?

396
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,210
No, Plankton, teamwork.

397
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,646
Tee-am work.

398
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,051
- Teamwork.
- Tie-'em work.

399
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,161
- Teamwork.
- Tie 'em up!

400
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,561
- Say "team," like a sports...
- Team.

401
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,404
- Team. Now say "work."
- Work.

402
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,567
Put them together. What do you got?

403
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,330
Time bomb work.

404
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,521
Getting better!

405
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,563
<i>Now, Bikini Bottom Action News!</i>

406
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,890
Oh, hey, Patrick!

407
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,881
Krabby Patty, Krabby Patty,
Krabby Patty, Krabby Patty!

408
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,284
Krabby Patty, Krabby Patty,
Krabby...

409
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,008
Krabby Patty, Krabby...

410
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,570
Krabby Patty...

411
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,005
Krabby...

412
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,527
Krabby!

413
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,290
Come on, tummy,

414
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,448
it's gonna be a long day.

415
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,888
<i>We interrupt
your regular program</i>

416
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,570
<i>for an important news bulletin.</i>

417
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,290
Perch Perkins reporting live

418
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,761
from downtown Bikini Bottom.

419
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,003
Complete chaos here today
as our town attempts to deal with

420
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,409
a sudden and complete shortage
of Krabby Patties. Whoa!

421
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,528
Events here have
this reporter wondering,

422
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,241
what is the secret ingredient in Krabby
Patties anyway?

423
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,564
It's love! The secret ingredient is love!

424
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,925
No more Krabby Patties?

425
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,286
If I'd have known that,

426
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,840
I'd have chewed it slower. Huh?

427
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,682
What the corndog is that?

428
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,122
Come on, Plankton, it's easy!

429
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,363
It means, I help you, you help me,

430
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,885
and when we accomplish our goal,

431
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,246
then we do hands in the middle.

432
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,364
Hands in the middle?
No, no. Sounds idiotic.

433
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,809
Besides, the two of us
are no match for that cranky mob!

434
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,648
We could probably use a few more

435
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,405
tee-am works.

436
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,891
That's exactly what I was thinking!

437
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,961
Wait, what are you doing?

438
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,970
I need Krabby Patties!

439
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,567
Patrick, what are you doing?

440
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,886
Krabby Patties!

441
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,405
Vandalizing stuff.

442
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,284
Isn't that your house?

443
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,044
Hey, what's with all the questions?

444
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,485
Who are you guys?

445
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,007
It's me, your best friend! SpongeBob?

446
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,323
Oh, yeah? Well, if you're SpongeBob,

447
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,562
then what's the secret password?

448
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,161
Uh...

449
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,282
Correct! It is you!

450
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,408
- SpongeBob!
- Whoa!

451
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,289
- SpongeBob.
- Patrick!

452
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,089
SpongeBob!

453
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,721
Why aren't you at The Krusty
Krab making Krabby Patties?

454
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,406
Well, I'd love to, but the formula's gone.

455
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,562
Yeah, Mr. Krabs says
you and Plankton took it.

456
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,210
No, that's not what happened.

457
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,691
It just disappeared.

458
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,762
We're putting a team together to find it.

459
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,251
A team?

460
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,721
Oh! Oh! Pick me! Pick me! Pick me!

461
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,080
Okay, Patrick, you're in.

462
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,650
I don't know, SpongeBob.

463
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,168
What exactly does this clown
bring to the tee-am?

464
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,522
He brings loyalty, Plankton.

465
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,087
Loyalty. Isn't that right, Patrick?

466
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,525
Yeah, yeah, loyalty.

467
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,082
I've got SpongeBob!

468
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,680
He's over here!

469
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,208
Let's go get him!

470
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,051
Come on, SpongeBob,
let's get out of here!

471
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,360
Patrick!

472
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,803
Patrick, why are you doing this?

473
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,167
Because I need

474
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,170
Krabby Patties!

475
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,242
Hurry up! I'm hungry!

476
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,445
Over here!

477
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,209
Guys, am I still on the team?

478
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,603
Hey, what are you looking at?

479
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,720
Sandy!

480
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,085
Sandy!

481
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,926
Sandy?

482
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,008
Sandy, are you home?

483
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,283
Gee, Plankton, I wonder where she is.

484
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,968
What is all this stuff?

485
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,161
Sandy?

486
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,084
Don't touch that!

487
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,925
Incoherent muttering.

488
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,162
Sandy? Are you okay?

489
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,446
Okay?

490
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,408
Have you looked outside?
Does that seem "okay" to you?

491
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,404
I'm trying to figure out
what happened to society.

492
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,444
If we don't fix it soon,

493
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,045
there won't be anything left to fix!

494
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,086
Sandy?

495
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,367
The lack of Krabby Patties
has driven her mad.

496
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,448
And I think I figgered it out.

497
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,281
Look.

498
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,285
When this came down from above,

499
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,929
I knew it could only mean one thing.

500
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,531
And that would be?

501
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,803
It means it's the end!

502
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,641
The sandwich gods are angry with us!

503
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,205
Sandwich gods?

504
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,887
I just don't know
how we're going to appease them!

505
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,289
You got any other friends
who aren't dim bulbs or nut jobs?

506
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:54,285
Well, I have one friend
who's loyal to the very end.

507
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,685
Gary, I'm home.

508
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,766
Gare-bear?

509
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,881
Gary?

510
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,361
Gary?

511
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,129
- Ugh.
- Huh?

512
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,247
Revolting!

513
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,209
But it means Gary is close by!

514
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,248
Gary, I'm back!

515
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,161
Whoa.

516
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,929
Oh, hey, Gary, Plankton and I need you
to help us find the Krabby Patty formula

517
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,241
and fix Bikini Bottom.

518
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,091
What do you mean, you don't
have to do as I say anymore?

519
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,124
What do you mean, "King of Snails"?

520
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,529
Gary The Snail, you get down here right
now and join this team!

521
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,844
What do you mean, "Seize them"?

522
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,726
Why are you running?

523
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,882
Because they're right on our tail.

524
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,684
Oh, right, snails.

525
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,684
Well, so much for your tee-am.

526
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,526
Putting together a team is a lot
harder than I thought it would be!

527
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,931
This way!

528
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,805
We better get out of here
until things cool off.

529
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,163
Everything we know
and love has been destroyed.

530
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,965
Oh, yeah, looks like
they're gonna have to

531
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,010
change the name
of Bikini Bottom to Dirty Bottom.

532
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,009
Right, SpongeBob?

533
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,003
That's kind of gross, Plankton.

534
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,401
Yeah. Yeah, too soon, huh?

535
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,324
This feels like it really is the end.

536
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,328
Don't worry, SpongeBob,

537
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,405
we'll find the secret formula and
everything will go back to the way it was,

538
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,721
you know, all happy and junk.

539
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,247
Now let's try and get some sleep.

540
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,560
Yeah, I guess you're right.

541
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,723
Here you are. Feel comfy?

542
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,251
You know, Plankton,

543
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,243
I think you might know a little bit more

544
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,130
about teamwork than you let on.

545
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,810
Good night, SpongeBob.

546
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,930
Good night, Plankton.

547
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,846
"Good night," indeed.

548
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,080
That's right, SpongeBob, sleep.

549
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,329
You're hiding that formula
in there somewhere.

550
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,367
Huh?

551
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,486
Well, here goes nothing.

552
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,641
Huh?

553
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,963
What is this place?

554
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,088
Fudge fight!

555
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,447
Oh, it's all over me!

556
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,126
Ew! It's so sweet in here!

557
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,601
I think my eyeball is getting a toothache!

558
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,284
Hello, Plankton.

559
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,806
Come and play with us.

560
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,166
Hurry

561
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,361
before we melt.

562
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,926
Whoa...

563
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,324
So much sweetness.

564
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,482
I think I'm going to be sick!

565
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,761
Huh?

566
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,806
Daddy!

567
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,562
Uh, Plankton? Oh, Plankton!

568
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,371
I just had
the craziest dream! And you were in it!

569
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,771
I'm sure it was nothing.

570
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,806
Now go back to sleep.

571
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,405
Were you in my brain?

572
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,404
What? No! That's crazy talk!

573
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,923
Then why is there
cotton candy on your antenna?

574
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,765
Because, uh, because, uh...

575
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,848
Okay, fine, I was in your brain.

576
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,042
What were you doing in there?

577
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,804
What do you think I was doing?

578
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,484
Looking for the secret formula.

579
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,608
- What?
- Don't act so innocent.

580
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,250
You knew what I was up to.

581
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,801
That's why you're pretending
not to know the formula.

582
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,166
I'm not pretending!

583
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,049
I can't believe you thought I was lying.

584
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,804
Hey, don't take it personally.

585
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,644
I just assume everyone is lying.

586
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,370
That is a horrible way

587
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,124
- to live your life.
- Whatever.

588
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,005
It is! And if we're going
to be on the same team...

589
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,969
Maybe I don't want to be

590
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,611
on the tee-am! You think of that?

591
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,649
But, Plankton, everything's better

592
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,961
when you're part of a team.

593
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,322
You're not going
to start singing, are you?

594
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,401
- <i>Teamwork!</i>
- Oh, brother.

595
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,165
<i>We can do anything
when we have teamwork</i>

596
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,562
<i>Don't you think so, my friend?</i>

597
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,165
<i>No, tee-am work</i>

598
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,891
<i>ls getting in the way
of my schee-am work</i>

599
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,407
<i>What don't you comprehend?</i>

600
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,482
<i>But working together is the key</i>

601
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,730
<i>Nothing's impossible
when it's you and me</i>

602
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,922
<i>I'm doing just fine on my own</i>

603
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,929
<i>Work is no fun when you do it alone</i>

604
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,407
<i>if I want it done right,
I'll do it by myself</i>

605
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,448
<i>But what if you need
something on a higher shelf?</i>

606
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,601
<i>But I'm the target</i>

607
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,206
<i>Of a very scary,
crazy post-apocalyptic mob!</i>

608
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,123
<i>Well, that's exactly
why you need a partner</i>

609
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,363
<i>Helping you with this important job</i>

610
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,522
<i>I'll be the hammer, you'll be the nail</i>

611
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,483
<i>I'll be the boat and you'll be the sail</i>

612
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,722
<i>I'm the flower, you're the aroma</i>

613
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,930
<i>Right now I wish I was in a coma</i>

614
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,081
Come on.

615
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,162
<i>I'm here for you and you're here for me</i>

616
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,686
<i>It's better when you plus me equals we</i>

617
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:44,003
<i>Working together in harmony</i>

618
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,367
<i>Side by side, we can reach our dreams</i>

619
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,050
<i>'Cause nothing's impossible</i>

620
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,566
<i>When we're a team!</i>

621
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,120
All right, you can put me down.

622
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,565
Well...

623
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,881
That's one minute of my life
I'll never get back.

624
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,371
Not without a time machine.

625
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,403
Wait a minute. Hold that thought.

626
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,004
Now back up.

627
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,926
Slow down.

628
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,520
Not without a time machine.

629
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,006
Hmm.

630
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,521
Yes!

631
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,684
- SpongeBob, you're a genius!
- I am?

632
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,962
If we build a time machine,

633
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,725
we can go back to before
the formula disappeared.

634
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,441
Before society broke down.
Before we became the hunted!

635
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,130
That sounds great, Plankton,

636
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,363
but how do we build a time machine?

637
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,841
Well, first we'll need
a computer powerful enough

638
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,048
to calculate the intricacies
of time travel.

639
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,531
Where would we get one of those?

640
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,601
Hmm.

641
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,331
There she is.
My computer wife.

642
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,562
They've got her tied up in the back room.

643
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,928
I've never seen this many
people at The Chum Bucket.

644
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,161
I've never seen anyone there.

645
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,480
Now was that really necessary?

646
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,766
Cause the food's really bad.

647
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,444
- Oh, come on! Really?
- Shh!

648
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,761
How are we gonna
sneak past those guards?

649
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,081
Hmm.

650
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,451
Well, what do we have here?

651
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,449
We better hurry.
Those guys really hate tires.

652
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,445
We'll never get in. The door's locked.

653
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,369
Hmm.

654
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,011
Wait. The window is open.

655
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,121
Come on, Plankton,

656
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,089
it's time for some teamwork.
Give me a boost.

657
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,128
Okay. Wait a minute, no!

658
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,802
Just a little higher, Plankton.

659
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,601
Plankton?

660
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:43,091
Why don't you boost me up instead?

661
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,571
Oh, yeah, good thinking.

662
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,887
Come on, SpongeBob, come on!

663
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,051
We're in!

664
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,486
Shh!

665
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,164
There's a guard over there.

666
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,520
Let's take the key from around his neck.

667
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,768
We're gonna have to be very quiet.

668
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,320
Let's walk on the tips of our toes.

669
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,208
Will you stop playing that tiny piano?

670
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,840
You're gonna get us caught.

671
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,161
Sorry.

672
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:33,364
Now just reach over and grab it.

673
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,642
Halt! Who goes there?

674
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,685
- Stop! Pull it over his head!
- Oh.

675
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,121
Stop, stop, stop!

676
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,403
Let me get up there.

677
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,570
Help me.

678
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,805
What?

679
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,921
No!

680
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,570
Plankton, help!

681
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,563
I'll rock him,
you tell him a bedtime story.

682
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,484
Once upon a time

683
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,882
there was a big fat
pink idiot who went to sleep. The end!

684
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,924
Nice try,
but it's gonna take more than that to...

685
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:03,244
<i>I told you, I don't have
the formula, you monsters!</i>

686
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,807
- Hey, baby, how are you?
<i>- Plankton!</i>

687
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,287
<i>My hero! You must need something,</i>

688
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,089
<i>otherwise you wouldn't have come back.</i>

689
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,925
Plankton has a plan
to save Bikini Bottom.

690
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:20,731
<i>It doesn't matter, Plankton.
Krabs knows all your plans.</i>

691
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,206
<i>He's been through my hard drive</i>

692
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,850
<i>looking for the secret formula.</i>

693
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,970
Eh, I never had it.
But we're going to get it.

694
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,610
We're gonna go back in time

695
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,961
to steal the formula
before it disappeared.

696
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,201
<i>Time travel!</i>

697
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,607
<i>Where are you gonna find
a computer that can do that?</i>

698
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,920
<i>Wait a minute!</i>

699
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,805
I've never carried a head before.

700
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,291
You'll get used to it.

701
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,050
It's still warm.

702
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,969
So you won't talk, huh?

703
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,771
Let some air out of him.

704
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,687
Is this where
we're gonna build our time machine?

705
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,167
Sure.
It's got everything we need.

706
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,321
A photo booth.

707
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,404
A cuckoo clock.

708
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,761
Some day-old chips.

709
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,002
Now all we have to do is build it.

710
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,890
Oh, no, you don't!

711
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,007
Hey, my pitch pipe!

712
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,651
Uh, I need it.
For the time machine.

713
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,927
Oh. Okay.

714
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,411
Installed!

715
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,841
Mmm.

716
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,284
I did it!

717
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,488
No, we did it!

718
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,403
Wait. We did do it.

719
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,806
As a tee-am.

720
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,609
- A team.
- Whatever.

721
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,843
<i>Working together in harmony</i>

722
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,241
<i>Side by side, we can reach our dreams</i>

723
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,246
<i>'Cause nothing's impossible
When we're a team</i>

724
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,727
Okay, now for the brains!

725
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,487
<i>Okay, Plankton, this is it.</i>

726
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,289
<i>It's gonna take all my processors</i>

727
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,209
<i>and energy to power this time machine.</i>

728
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,368
<i>So if you have anything
you wanna tell me,</i>

729
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,851
<i>you better tell me now.</i>

730
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,290
Well, Karen...

731
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,169
I know I've taken you for granted

732
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,765
all these years, and

733
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,444
I, I just wanted to say,

734
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,807
I'm glad you're on my tee-am.

735
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,001
<i>Oh, Sheldon,</i>

736
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,800
<i>that's the sweetest thing you've ever...</i>

737
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,483
Plankton, are you crying?

738
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,324
No, no, no!

739
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,723
It's just one of the hazards
of having a giant eyeball.

740
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,768
There's always stuff getting in there.

741
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,569
Anyway,
where were we?

742
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,285
Say "cheese."

743
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,125
Cheese!

744
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,682
According to my calculations,

745
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,804
The Krusty Krab should be right here!

746
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,723
What's that over there?

747
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,281
- SpongeBob?
- Patrick?

748
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,805
Is it really you?

749
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,843
- Yes, Patrick, it's...
- Finally!

750
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,846
The Great Krabby Patty Famine is over!

751
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,288
Great Krabby Patty Famine?
Oh, what year is this?

752
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,646
It's Thursday.

753
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,888
According to my calculations,

754
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,440
we've only gone four days into the future.

755
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,170
Where is everybody?

756
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:46,126
They all gave up on you. But not me!

757
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,362
Cause I'm not very smart.

758
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,928
Where is The Krusty Krab?

759
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,282
Right where it's always been!

760
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,843
I think we may be lost in time, Plankton.

761
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,207
Maybe we should ask
this guy for directions.

762
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,609
Excuse me, sir?
Can you tell us when we are?

763
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:36,286
Who dares disturb
The One Who Watches?

764
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,646
The One Who Watches?

765
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,723
Your name is The One Who Watches?

766
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,327
No, my true name is

767
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,084
Bubbles.

768
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,724
Bubbles?

769
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,565
What kind of a name is Bubbles?

770
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,331
It is my ancient dolphin name.

771
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,164
So what's a dolphin doing out here

772
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,446
in the middle of space?

773
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,681
My kind

774
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,331
have been watching and protecting

775
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,687
the galaxy for...

776
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,366
Hmm.

777
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,688
10,000 years!

778
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,001
Oh, so you're the one

779
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,048
keeping the meteors from hitting us.

780
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,246
Yes, I am.

781
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:15,364
And I could really do with a potty break.

782
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,171
Would you mind
keeping an eye on things?

783
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:22,321
Sure thing. But, uh,
what am I keeping my eye on?

784
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,086
What are you doing?

785
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,605
I'm watching.

786
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,245
We don't even know
what we're watching for.

787
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,608
Maybe we should split up the workload.

788
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,364
You watch the one with the big red eye,

789
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,283
I'll watch the one with the ringy thingies.

790
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,084
Like a team.

791
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,531
Okay, mine's moving.

792
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,125
Mine, too.

793
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,565
No, this doesn't seem right.

794
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:50,767
Should we call Bubbles?

795
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,171
Let's give him a minute.
He's been holding it

796
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,401
for 10,000 years.

797
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,328
I'm pretty sure that wasn't
supposed to happen.

798
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,084
Come on, Plankton,
we got to clean this up

799
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,208
before Bubbles gets back!

800
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,851
Much better. Yes.

801
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,686
You two are free to go.

802
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,771
What happened to Saturn and Jupiter?

803
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,722
You were supposed to...

804
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,642
Keep them from smashing
into each other!

805
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:36,801
Sorry.

806
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:39,207
Now
I am going to lose my job!

807
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,887
And you will lose your lives.

808
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,845
Quarter me!

809
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,440
Plankton?

810
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,200
SpongeBob!

811
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,804
Plankton?

812
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,291
SpongeBob?

813
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,044
Who are you two supposed to be?

814
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,049
I'm you, from the future.

815
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,849
And I'm him from the future.

816
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,570
So you traveled back through time

817
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,529
to help me? Great thinking.

818
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,965
Nope. He's helping me.

819
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,485
But he's the enemy!

820
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,847
Was the enemy.
Now we're a team.

821
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,888
What? A tee-am?

822
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,730
A team!

823
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,042
All right, go get the formula.

824
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,125
What have I become?

825
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,566
All right, Plankton.

826
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,807
Do you have
flying boatmobiles in the future?

827
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:54,961
We only came back

828
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,367
from the day after tomorrow, dimwit.

829
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,010
Are there rocket packs?

830
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,645
Oh!

831
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:01,801
Did they outlaw

832
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,331
- clothes in the future?
- No!

833
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,481
Then why are you naked?

834
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,927
Because they don't make
clothes in my size.

835
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,041
Hold still, you!

836
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:13,202
If you're from the future,
what am I gonna say next?

837
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,408
- Something moronic?
- Wow.

838
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,284
Hey, hurry up over there!

839
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,364
Uh-oh. That ain't good.

840
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,409
<i>Initiating lockdown sequence.</i>

841
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,847
Come on, SpongeBob,
we gotta get out of here!

842
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,487
- Got it!
- Come on!

843
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,088
Oh, that was crazy!

844
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,561
So that's what teamwork is.

845
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,325
All those years I tried to make you mine,

846
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,289
and I finally did it.

847
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,761
I mean, we did it!

848
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,930
And so it would seem that

849
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:57,881
our heroes have accomplished
all they had set out to do.

850
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,770
- Now that's an ending.
- Whoo-hoo!

851
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,491
Andy, cue the music.

852
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,531
Oh, no.

853
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,728
That's not the end.

854
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,849
So you mean the ending
might be even happier?

855
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,480
Here we go!

856
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,682
Land ho!

857
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,409
Mom, where's my towel?

858
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,407
What?

859
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,565
Whoa!

860
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,202
- Whoa! Dude, look at that.
- What?

861
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,526
I'm coming! Come on, you lazy people!

862
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,645
Out of my way! I'm coming!

863
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,722
Out of there!

864
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,006
Sorry!

865
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,242
- Too fast!
- Slow down!

866
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,682
- I'm coming!
- No, no!

867
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,890
Yeah!

868
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,726
All right,
you feathered rats, time to shove off!

869
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,008
What? Why?

870
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:22,562
Well, I can't have you pooping

871
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,722
all over my restaurant, can I?

872
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,127
Restaurant? I thought
this was a pirate ship.

873
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,122
Oh, it is.

874
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,725
But it is also...

875
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,806
A-ha!

876
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,805
My very own food truck!

877
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,001
A what?

878
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,606
Uh, you know, a restaurant on wheels.

879
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,763
- Like a garbage truck.
- No!

880
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,082
Are you trying to
scare away my customers?

881
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,124
Well, we're not leaving
till we see how the story ends.

882
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,091
No problem.

883
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:06,604
You guys like
a little snack while you wait?

884
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,529
- Sure, I'll take a curdled milk.
- How about a fish head?

885
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,045
And a French fry covered in sand.

886
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,681
Who wants some

887
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,001
hot wings?

888
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,083
Wait a minute. Where's Kyle?

889
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,770
Which one of you is next?

890
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,451
He's a madman!

891
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:24,647
Let's get out of here!

892
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,609
You crazy, man! You crazy!

893
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,170
Bye-bye, Mr. Poop.

894
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,480
Now I can get my gold sticker.

895
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,329
Oh, hey, Mr. Piwate.

896
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,482
I wouldn't go in there
if I were you.

897
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,285
Boo!

898
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,805
I can't fly without my feathers.

899
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,685
Where to, Mac?

900
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,330
Just dwive.

901
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,730
Oh...

902
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,001
Squidward!

903
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:03,168
Still out of Krabby Patties.

904
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,568
Does anyone have a picture

905
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,130
of ketchup?

906
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,810
I done figgered it out!

907
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:15,570
We have angered the sandwich gods

908
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:19,486
and only a sacrifice will appease them!

909
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,290
Well, that sounds reasonable.

910
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:24,882
Soon our
post-apoca-whatchamacallit will be over,

911
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:28,971
and Krabby Patties
will rain down from above!

912
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,520
Rain down? Well, that's no good.

913
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,364
How will I get me money?

914
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,603
Oh, you don't like that idea?
Then we'll sacrifice you!

915
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:39,525
Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

916
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:47,651
It's not a good idea to have a sacrifice

917
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:49,768
on an empty stomach.

918
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,922
Who wants a Krabby Patty?

919
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,971
SpongeBob, is that me formuler?

920
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,644
On, happy day!

921
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,371
I missed you so much.

922
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,762
Where was it?
Where did you find it?

923
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,808
Well, Plankton and I built a time machine

924
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,769
out of an old photo booth
and then we added...

925
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,285
- Cheese!
- Patrick, wait!

926
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,366
It's okay, everyone.

927
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:15,285
The post-apocalypse is almost over!

928
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,768
Ain't that right, SpongeBob?

929
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,688
"Eugene, eat my

930
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,008
"subaquatic air bubbles.

931
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,565
"Love, Plankton"?

932
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,722
You grabbed the wrong bottle!

933
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,484
I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs!

934
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,449
That's okay, SpongeBob.

935
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:37,569
We'll just have to sacrifice
the two of you then.

936
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:40,769
Prepare them for the sacrifice!

937
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:45,802
I bring a message from the dawn of time!

938
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,001
What is it, Patrick?

939
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,089
Run!

940
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:54,002
Squidosaurus rex!

941
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:05,521
Well, Plankton,

942
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,921
I guess we failed
to accomplish our goals.

943
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,525
"We"?

944
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,443
But even failure hurts a little less

945
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,966
when you do it as a team, right?

946
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,610
This is all your fault!

947
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,041
My fault?

948
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:21,885
You're the one who stole
the wrong secret formula.

949
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,564
I didn't know there were two bottles.

950
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,768
Of course you didn't!

951
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:28,366
Because you got cotton candy for brains!

952
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,885
Ooh!

953
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,962
No, seriously, he really does.

954
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,565
Well, we wouldn't even be in this mess

955
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:36,086
in the first place, if you
weren't so selfish and evil.

956
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,969
I was selfish and evil,

957
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,964
until you ruined everything
with your "teamwork"!

958
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:43,049
Oh! You take that back!

959
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:46,403
You are the worst teammate ever!

960
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,010
No!

961
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:01,482
Oh, my Neptune, he's mixing
garbage and recycling!

962
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,684
Look at me.

963
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,323
Why, I've become like all of you.

964
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,690
Savage.

965
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:20,126
Fear-ridden.

966
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,771
Selfish.

967
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:25,003
An entire town of formerly good citizens

968
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:27,686
turned into heartless freaks,

969
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,649
bent on their own self-prever...

970
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,290
Self-preter...

971
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,727
- "Preservation?"
- Yes!

972
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:36,610
We've become alienated
from each other.

973
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:39,047
Each one an island unto himself,

974
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,202
concerned only with ourselves.

975
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,044
And in the name of all fishhood,

976
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,521
I am not about to let that happen!

977
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,121
And so,

978
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,328
if a sacrifice is needed to restore

979
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,767
Bikini Bottom to its former glory...

980
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:01,242
Then I am willing
to take one for the team!

981
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:13,401
You heard him!

982
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,245
Sacrifice!

983
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:19,643
Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

984
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,171
Sacrifice!

985
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:24,244
Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

986
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,371
Let the sacrifice begin!

987
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,608
Patties! Patties!

988
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,331
And I thought my friends were primitive.

989
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,684
Don't cry, me boy.

990
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,889
Everything's going to be fine, for us.

991
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,566
Oh, I'm not crying,
Mr. Krabs.

992
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,085
I smell Krabby Patties!

993
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:53,808
That's right. Keep thinking
happy thoughts. Now!

994
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,689
Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

995
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:09,330
The boy's right.

996
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:11,041
My leg!

997
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,451
I smell 'em, too!

998
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:14,807
Okay, SpongeBob, go get it!

999
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:18,527
Wait. You mean we can
just take this stuff off?

1000
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,290
Go find that Krabby Patty!

1001
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,240
Come on, everybody!

1002
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:28,443
I've got some Krabby Patty orders to fill!

1003
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,482
It's coming from over there!

1004
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:03,842
Come on, guys, I think
it's just over this hill.

1005
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,002
How do you expect us
to go up to the surface?

1006
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,320
We won't be able to breathe!

1007
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,562
All right, all secondary characters

1008
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:15,005
come with me.

1009
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:17,765
- Yeah, I'm with you guys.
- No way, Squidward.

1010
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:20,081
You're going up there with us.

1011
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,605
My feet hurt.

1012
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:24,365
Patrick, you don't have feet.

1013
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:27,011
It's not fair! You have feet.

1014
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:30,880
Sandy has feet. Squidward has feet.

1015
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,644
Actually, I have four feet.

1016
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,120
It's not about feet.

1017
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,645
What is it about, then?

1018
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:41,404
It's about being a team

1019
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,568
and sticking together, no matter what!

1020
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:46,007
The only way we're going
up there is if some

1021
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:49,482
fairy godmother shows up
and helps us breathe air.

1022
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:57,604
- Bubbles!
- SpongeBob, you know this guy?

1023
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:59,808
Don't hurt us!
We're sorry we got you fired.

1024
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:02,121
Hurt you?

1025
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:05,170
Why, I traveled back
through time to thank you.

1026
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,210
I've been stuck in that job for eons.

1027
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,642
I needed a change,

1028
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,610
but I was too afraid to go for it.

1029
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:16,690
Well, Bubbles, I'm glad we could help.

1030
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:19,411
Now it is my turn to help.

1031
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:22,245
I can get you safely to the surface.

1032
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,010
Now!

1033
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:27,482
Quick, all of you, get in my mouth.

1034
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:28,971
Come on, guys, let's go!

1035
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:32,249
There's no way I'm climbing
into some dolphin's mouth.

1036
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:34,840
Yeah. This guy just wants a free lunch.

1037
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,008
Guys, if Bubbles has the courage

1038
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:39,162
to quit his dead-end, nowhere job

1039
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:41,208
and travel back through time to help us,

1040
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,089
then we need to have the courage to...

1041
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:50,122
Well, I never thought
I'd be eaten by a dolphin.

1042
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,366
No, if he was eating us,

1043
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,727
he'd be chewing us up
and we'd be going down there.

1044
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:56,207
This is what you call riding in style.

1045
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:58,601
Not a lot of legroom in here.

1046
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,485
Well, maybe if you didn't have four feet!

1047
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:06,168
Note to self:
Never stow away in a gym sock.

1048
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:20,165
What's happening? I feel tingly!

1049
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:30,320
Ow, my neck!

1050
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,208
I've done all I can.

1051
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,442
The rest is up to you.

1052
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:38,045
Thank you, Bubbles!

1053
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,208
Farewell, SpongeBob.

1054
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:41,845
Farewell, Bubbles.

1055
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,082
Now to update my...

1056
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,324
Resume!

1057
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:55,723
Ah! Fresh air! Oh, how I've missed you.

1058
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:58,440
Ugh! This place smells awful!

1059
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,090
Come on, guys.

1060
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,725
Let's get the Krabby Patty formula

1061
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:02,926
and save Bikini Bottom.

1062
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,006
Whoa!

1063
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:08,202
What is this place?

1064
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:11,284
I have a bad feeling about this.

1065
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:14,768
Maybe this guy knows
where we are. He looks smart.

1066
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,450
He's got five heads.

1067
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:19,888
Uh, sir? Could you tell us
where to find a Krabby Patty?

1068
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:22,611
Hey, my friend's talking to you!

1069
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,607
What?

1070
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:28,928
A giant, hairy porpoise!

1071
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,923
It's beached!

1072
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:34,329
It's suffering. Poor thing.

1073
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:35,680
Y'all, those aren't porpoises.

1074
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:37,722
- All hands on deck!
- Oh, brother.

1075
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:40,608
We need to get these guys
back in the water.

1076
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,131
Come on! Push!

1077
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:44,368
- Heave!
- Ho!

1078
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:50,844
- Heave!
- Ho!

1079
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,491
Put your back into it!

1080
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:54,164
Come on, push!

1081
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,005
Well, I guess
this is where that

1082
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:59,242
horrible smell was coming from.

1083
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:13,606
Whoa!

1084
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,285
Excuse me, do you know
where we can get

1085
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:16,970
a Krabby Patty around here?

1086
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,690
Invaders!

1087
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:19,921
Uh-oh.

1088
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,685
You get out of my sister's sand castle!

1089
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,603
Mom!

1090
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,121
Oh!

1091
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:41,651
Where have you been all my life?

1092
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:47,726
Ow. Whoa!

1093
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:49,726
Mmm.

1094
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,848
Oh, Frank.

1095
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,763
That feels so good.

1096
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,121
Gross!

1097
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:02,008
Oh, hey, Squidward.

1098
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:03,891
Sandy!

1099
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:05,371
The Krabby Patty!

1100
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:06,960
I think I see where it's coming from!

1101
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,322
SpongeBob, you will not believe the size

1102
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:23,765
of the ice creams here.

1103
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:26,081
I wonder what other
giant snacks they have.

1104
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,208
Cotton candy?

1105
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,166
Wow.

1106
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:33,924
If you ate all that,
you'd have enough energy

1107
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,286
to run around the whole world!

1108
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:36,850
Whoo-hoo!

1109
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,771
Ugh! When is the sugar gonna wear off?

1110
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:09,766
Hey, guys, I smell Krabby Patties!

1111
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,803
- I think it's this way!
- Huh?

1112
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:16,805
Don't leave me, Squidward!

1113
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:26,210
- Now what?
- We're never going to make it!

1114
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:27,801
Huh?

1115
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:37,207
- Heave!
- Ho!

1116
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,802
We're doing it, guys!

1117
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:45,488
Dude, watch out!

1118
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:46,925
Hold on!

1119
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,963
SpongeBob!

1120
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:52,691
- Huh? Lean!
- Starboard!

1121
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:55,606
Whoa!

1122
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:04,447
- What the...
- What?

1123
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:07,405
"Home of the Krabby Patty"?

1124
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:12,011
But The Krusty Krab
is the home of the Krabby Patty!

1125
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:13,809
Mr. Krabs, what are we gonna do?

1126
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:16,087
$8.99 for a Krabby Patty?

1127
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:19,209
Why didn't I think of that?

1128
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:33,009
- You!
- Huh?

1129
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:37,285
Cease and desist that
unauthorized patty flipping!

1130
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,044
Yeah, that's my job!

1131
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:40,520
How did you get here?

1132
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:42,770
You cannot breathe air.

1133
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:44,689
Well, there was this magical dolphin

1134
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,728
from the future who shot us
out of his blowhole, and...

1135
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,928
Wait! Wait.

1136
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,490
That's not in the book.

1137
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:55,641
Book?

1138
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:58,161
There is no magical dolphin in this story.

1139
01:04:58,320 --> 01:04:59,810
What story?

1140
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:06,047
The story of how Bikini
Bottom was brought to its knees

1141
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:08,805
when its beloved Krabby Patty formula

1142
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,360
was stolen by me,

1143
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,010
Burger Beard.

1144
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:15,964
How does it end?

1145
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,367
Well, let me see.

1146
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:20,761
It looks like, uh,

1147
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:24,726
Burger Beard becomes the richest

1148
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:28,441
food truck proprietor in all the land.

1149
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:30,921
But how did you steal the formula?

1150
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,047
That was easy.

1151
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:36,049
I simply rewrote the story, and...

1152
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:37,207
Poof!

1153
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,084
Me formuler!

1154
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:41,242
What do you mean, rewrote the story?

1155
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:42,566
Watch this.

1156
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,371
"The brave

1157
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:47,249
"and handsome

1158
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:49,243
"Burger Beard

1159
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:52,483
"banished our poor heroes..."

1160
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:54,608
"...to be stranded on

1161
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:57,002
"Pelican island!"

1162
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:02,328
"The End"!

1163
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:08,969
Oh, this looks bad.

1164
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:10,849
And these guys look hungry!

1165
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:14,963
Look out!

1166
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,331
Nice. So this is what teamwork gets you.

1167
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:25,165
Here! Take Squidward, you vile beasts!

1168
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:28,483
I want to be on a new team.
This one's broken.

1169
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:30,483
Sandy, you're smart.
You have any ideas?

1170
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,169
I ain't been too smart

1171
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:35,766
since I found this old piece of paper!

1172
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:41,083
- What?
- Incoming!

1173
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,250
Wait a minute!

1174
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:53,446
Now all we need

1175
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:54,686
is some ink!

1176
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,440
Oh. Which Squidward
has helpfully provided.

1177
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:59,763
It happens when I'm nervous.

1178
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:02,206
Whatever you're going to do,

1179
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:04,681
make it quick! They're closing in on us!

1180
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:06,250
I'm gonna write us an ending.

1181
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:10,044
Will it be a happy ending?

1182
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:12,600
It's going to be superpowered!

1183
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:24,650
I'll show you a happy ending.

1184
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:38,281
Huh?

1185
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:42,486
Da-da-da-da!

1186
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:43,891
- Patrick!
- Huh?

1187
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:47,085
Hey. I got feet!

1188
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,970
Oh, what is in these things?

1189
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:55,881
We'll take one secret formula to go!

1190
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,365
Clear the area, citizens.

1191
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:03,330
There's going to be
some serious aft-kicking here.

1192
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:09,529
But I banished you.

1193
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:11,085
Sour Note?

1194
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:21,323
My tiny little eardrums!

1195
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:26,090
Hey, hey, wait! Hold on! Hold on!

1196
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:28,931
Wait! Wait! Customers!

1197
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:31,202
Wait, please!

1198
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,444
Mr. Superawesomeness,

1199
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:35,405
take him down.

1200
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,364
- Huh?
- Huh?

1201
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:54,291
Um, maybe we should have picked

1202
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:56,050
a better superpower for you, Patrick.

1203
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,880
Let's see you get out of this one!

1204
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:02,571
Ka-ching!

1205
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:10,890
Get ready for the Invinci-Bubble!

1206
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:15,371
No!

1207
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:16,971
My book!

1208
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:22,043
All right, team,
time for hands in the middle!

1209
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:23,485
Yes! Huh?

1210
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:25,210
Oh, yeah.

1211
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:34,003
Great job, guys. We did it!

1212
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:35,321
Ew!

1213
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:37,401
Huh?

1214
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:38,600
What?

1215
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,927
Sandy? Is that you?

1216
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:44,004
You can call me The Rodent!

1217
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:45,320
Hi-yah!

1218
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,927
Hey, where'd the pirate go?

1219
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:53,644
Hmm. Uh...

1220
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:58,886
Mmm.

1221
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,610
It looks like Burger Beard

1222
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:03,121
forgot the first rule
of mobile fry cooking.

1223
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:06,280
Always batten down your grease traps.

1224
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:09,761
Follow that grease, team!

1225
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,685
There she blows.

1226
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,240
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1227
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:42,971
Whoo-hoo!

1228
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:09,206
Whoo!

1229
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:13,762
Oh, no, you don't.

1230
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:18,561
Ow!

1231
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:23,522
Oh!

1232
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:42,611
He's after the book!

1233
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,767
Sandy, use your squirrel powers!

1234
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:46,921
Roger that!

1235
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,405
Oh, she's never gonna make it!

1236
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:57,810
Huh? Everyone...

1237
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:59,604
Lean!

1238
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:18,561
That's what you get.

1239
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:34,404
Come here.

1240
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:36,246
The book!

1241
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:37,890
Sour Note!

1242
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:54,449
All right, Burger Beard,

1243
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:56,608
prepare to be teamworked!

1244
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:00,282
I'm going to scrub my armpits with you.

1245
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:02,442
Uh, I don't get it.

1246
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:03,931
Because you're a sponge.

1247
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:05,121
Duh.

1248
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:06,571
Oh.

1249
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:08,210
Get him, The Rodent!

1250
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,970
Consider him roasted!

1251
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:21,801
Huh?

1252
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:32,727
Aw, nuts! I'm all out of nuts!

1253
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,846
Justice is best soft served.

1254
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:50,963
Patrick, I should have
never doubted your powers!

1255
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:06,565
I can't think of a sweeter way to go.

1256
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:10,404
Ha! It's all mine!

1257
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:13,570
Not so fast, Booger Beard!

1258
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:32,324
Me formuler. Huh?

1259
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:35,927
This will make you feel a little butter.

1260
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:39,051
Not melted butter!

1261
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:44,525
Mr. Krabs!

1262
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:50,686
<i>Voila!</i>

1263
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:52,610
Uh-oh.

1264
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,081
A-ha!

1265
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,563
Oh. yeah!

1266
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:06,846
Huh?

1267
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,041
Hoo-hoo!

1268
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:26,325
Ta-da!

1269
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:32,125
They're beautiful!

1270
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:35,010
Patrick!

1271
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:51,885
I gotcha!

1272
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,161
SpongeBob!

1273
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:55,966
- Patrick?
- Talk to me, buddy.

1274
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:58,771
I'm... I'm seeing a bright light.

1275
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:00,644
Is this better?

1276
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:02,484
Much. Thank you.

1277
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:05,609
But the discomfort I feel
in my eyes is nothing

1278
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:07,330
compared to the shame I feel

1279
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:09,448
for letting down the Patty.

1280
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:11,568
For letting down Bikini Bottom.

1281
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:14,291
Yeah, SpongeBob, you really blew it.

1282
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:17,649
No, Patrick, we blew it, as a team.

1283
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:20,161
Nope. This one's on you.

1284
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:25,851
Where do you
think you're going?

1285
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,607
Why don't you get going, little fella,

1286
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:34,250
before you hurt yourself?

1287
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:47,406
Plankton?

1288
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:50,042
It's Plank-Ton!

1289
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,731
Come on down from there, little fella.

1290
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:57,847
You wouldn't want to get hurt.

1291
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:00,090
Huh?

1292
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:23,644
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

1293
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:25,051
Huh?

1294
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:27,251
My eye!

1295
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:41,651
He's getting away!

1296
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:47,445
Ready for a Plank-Ton of bubbles?

1297
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:11,648
The formula, please.

1298
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:13,728
Come on. Team up with me.

1299
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:15,848
We'll be rich and powerful! Huh?

1300
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:17,121
No, thanks.

1301
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:19,322
I'm already part of a teamwork.

1302
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:45,242
Can we do hands in the middle again?

1303
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:46,560
Yes, we can, Patrick.

1304
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:49,610
But this time, there's one more
hand to go in the middle.

1305
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:53,761
Plankton?

1306
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:56,605
Hmm.

1307
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,768
Oh, no.

1308
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:05,371
- Here you go, Krabs.
- Huh?

1309
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:07,045
She's all yours.

1310
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:10,442
This doesn't have
another insulting note in it, does it?

1311
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:12,924
No, that's the old me.

1312
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,401
The one who turned his back
on everything important

1313
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:18,205
just to have that formula all to himself.

1314
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:19,930
But I realize now that keeping

1315
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,367
something to myself is...

1316
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:24,207
Selfish.

1317
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:26,084
Especially when that something

1318
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:27,525
is the Krabby Patty.

1319
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:29,210
Okay, everybody, let's get back

1320
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:31,169
To Bikini Bottom and...

1321
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:33,766
Oh, no! I don't have the page!

1322
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:34,921
Oh, no!

1323
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,530
It must be
back on Pelican Island!

1324
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:40,042
Don't worry. I thought of everything.

1325
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:42,891
All right, SpongeBob, take us home.

1326
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:44,405
Thanks.

1327
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,528
- Squidward!
- Oh, yeah.

1328
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:48,204
Come on, it's time to go back

1329
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:50,203
and open up The Krusty Krab!

1330
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:52,806
Are you out of your patty-flipping mind?

1331
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,086
I'll never leave this place!

1332
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:57,482
I mean, look at me. I'm a god!

1333
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:00,086
No, Squidward, you're a cashier.

1334
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:04,763
Wait a minute! What? No!

1335
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:10,970
Well, it was fun while it lasted.

1336
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:13,491
Don't be sad, Squidward.

1337
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:16,291
I left you a little
surprise under your shirt!

1338
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:20,248
Rock-hard abs!

1339
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:24,281
Aw, SpongeBob, you're okay in my book.

1340
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:25,360
Aw, shucks.

1341
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:29,325
Excuse us! We'd like 3,000
Krabby Patties, please!

1342
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:35,963
That sound must mean
things are back to normal.

1343
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:38,606
Who wants 3,000 Krabby Patties?

1344
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:44,609
First one's for you, Gary.

1345
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:46,648
Extra mayo, just the way you like it.

1346
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:49,887
A-ha!

1347
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:51,564
Caught you red-handed!

1348
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:53,444
Gary hates mayo.

1349
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:57,241
Plankton!
Up to your old tricks again already, eh?

1350
01:20:57,320 --> 01:20:59,846
Hey, I'm just
putting things back the way they were.

1351
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:01,684
What do you have
to say about this, Gary?

1352
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:03,762
Oh, shrimp.

1353
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,571
See you later, tee-am-mate!

1354
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:20,807
- Now can we sing it?
- Yeah!

1355
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,007
Pwease, Mr. Piwate?

1356
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:27,288
On, Kyle...

1357
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:31,484
How can I say no to you?

1358
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:35,244
Are you ready, kids?

1359
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:36,924
Aye-aye, Captain!

1360
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,561
Uh, what did you say?
There's sand in my ears and

1361
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:42,608
I can't hear you!

1362
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:45,047
Aye-aye, Captain!

1363
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:47,528

1364
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:50,568

Silence!

1375
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:15,761
Oh, man. I like that song.
What happened?

1376
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:18,127
I don't like that song
and I put an end to it.

1377
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:19,565
Well, this music is terrible.

1378
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:20,971
I suppose you're entitled to your...

1379
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:22,366
Wait. Why am I talking to you?

1380
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:23,846
<i>You're an inferior species</i>

<i>You all stand no chance</i>

1389
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:43,645
<i>Against my power
Don't try it</i>

01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:45,165
<i>Just sit there with your flappy beak shut</i>

1391
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:46,241

01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:12,407

You know what this needs?

1412
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:38,243
A little interpretive dance!
