00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:44,400
What are you looking at, Caroline?
-The wind, mom.

3
00:00:47,701 --> 00:00:50,701
They say a hurricane is coming.

4
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,300
I feel like I'm on a boat...
drifting.

5
00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:04,820
Can I do anything for you, mom?
Make anything easier?

6
00:01:06,139 --> 00:01:10,400
Oh, sugar. There is
nothing left to do.

7
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:13,500
It is what it is.

8
00:01:13,701 --> 00:01:17,701
I'm finding it harder
to keep my eyes open.

9
00:01:18,839 --> 00:01:22,000
My mouth's full of... cotton.

10
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:27,120
There, there, miss Daisy.
You will scratch yourself to ribbons.

11
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:35,860
Do you want any more
medication, mother?

12
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,580
Doctor said you can
have as much as you want.

13
00:01:39,781 --> 00:01:42,581
No need for anybody to suffer.

14
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,000
A friend told me that...

15
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:02,601
she never had a chance to say
goodbye to her mother.

16
00:02:05,139 --> 00:02:08,420
I wanted to tell you...

17
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,640
how much I'm gonna miss you.
Mom.

18
00:02:14,841 --> 00:02:17,041
Oh, Caroline.

19
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:26,520
Are you afraid?
-I'm curious.

20
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:30,120
What comes next...

21
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:39,580
They built that train
station in 1918.

22
00:02:40,381 --> 00:02:43,981
Our father was there
the day it opened.

23
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,080
He said that...

24
00:02:49,381 --> 00:02:51,881
a tuba band was playing.

25
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,740
They had the finest clockmaker
in all of the South

26
00:03:00,141 --> 00:03:03,341
to build that glorious clock.

27
00:03:04,742 --> 00:03:07,242
His name was

28
00:03:08,143 --> 00:03:10,643
Mr Gateau.

29
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,840
Mr Cake.

30
00:03:18,241 --> 00:03:22,441
He was married to a Creole
of Evangeline Parish

31
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,520
and they had a son.

32
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:31,940
Mr Gateau was from birth
absolutely blind.

33
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,360
When their son was old enough,
he joined the army.

34
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:43,661
They prayed God would keep him
out of harm's way.

35
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:51,460
For months, he did nothing
but work on that clock.

36
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,340
One day a letter came.

37
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:11,680
Mr Gateau, done for the night,
went up alone to bed.

38
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:18,080
And their son came home.

39
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,840
They burried him
in a family plot

40
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,060
where he would be with them
when their time came.

41
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,880
Mr Cake worked on his clock,

42
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,360
laboring to finish.

43
00:04:43,361 --> 00:04:46,961
It was a morning to remember.

44
00:04:47,739 --> 00:04:51,420
Papa said there were
people everywhere.

45
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,420
Even Teddy Roosevelt came.

46
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,800
It's running backwards!

47
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:18,520
I made it that way.

48
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,020
So that perhaps the boys
that we lost in a war

49
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,940
might stand and
come home again.

50
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,120
Home to farm,

51
00:05:30,421 --> 00:05:32,421
work,

52
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:35,660
have children,

53
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,860
to live long, full lives.

54
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,400
Perhaps my own son
might come home again.

55
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,260
I'm sorry if I offended anybody.

56
00:05:59,061 --> 00:06:01,961
I hope you enjoy my clock.

57
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:06,062
Mr Cake was never seen again.

58
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:15,060
Some say he died
of a broken heart.

59
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:19,640
Some say he went to sea...

60
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,640
Excuse me, do you mind
if I make a call?

61
00:06:26,841 --> 00:06:29,641
Somebody's watching
my little boy. -Sure.

62
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:42,180
I hope I haven't
disappointed you.

63
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:45,381
You couldn't disappoint me.

64
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,140
Well, I...

65
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:52,600
I know I don't have much
to show for myself.

66
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:56,740
The suitcase.

67
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:03,680
There's a diary.

68
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,440
This?

69
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:14,500
Could you read it to me, dear?
-Is this what you wanna do?

70
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,460
I tried to read it a hundred
different times...

71
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,100
Mom, it's not exactly...

72
00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:27,020
Just the sound of
your voice, darling.

73
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,960
It's dated "April 4th, 1985."

74
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:36,880
It says, "New Orleans."

75
00:07:37,181 --> 00:07:39,981
This is my last will
and testament.

76
00:07:40,182 --> 00:07:44,382
I don't have much to leave,
few possessions, no money really.

77
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:48,180
I will go out of this world
the same way I came in,

78
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,220
alone and with nothing.
All I have is my story.

79
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:56,020
I'm writing it now
while I still remember it.

80
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,220
My name is Benjamin.
Benjamin Button.

81
00:08:00,422 --> 00:08:03,960
And I was born under
unusual circumstances.

82
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:07,140
The first world war had ended.

83
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:11,460
I've been told it was an
especially good night to be born.

84
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,400
We won the war!

85
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,920
What are you doing here?
-Thomas...

86
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:52,720
I'm afraid she's gonna die.
-What?

87
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,100
That's enough! All of you!
Get away from her!

88
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,420
I came as quickly as I could.
The streets are filled with people.

89
00:09:04,739 --> 00:09:08,340
Thomas, promise me
he has a place...

90
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:11,860
Yeah.

91
00:09:12,861 --> 00:09:15,661
She gave her life for me.

92
00:09:15,862 --> 00:09:19,262
And for that,
I am forever grateful.

93
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,080
Mr Button...!

94
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,860
Thomas!

95
00:09:49,439 --> 00:09:51,500
Thomas, wait!

96
00:10:20,499 --> 00:10:25,180
Hey, what are you doing there!?
What do you have there?

97
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:37,440
The air is sweet.

98
00:11:41,141 --> 00:11:44,541
You look very handsome
tonigh, miss Queenie.

99
00:11:45,642 --> 00:11:48,642
Handsome as I ever seen you.

100
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,640
The brown matches your eyes.
-Oh, hush!

101
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,960
You ain't no slouch yourself.

102
00:12:07,219 --> 00:12:10,860
Hambert's back in town.
He came home legless...

103
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:16,400
but he home... I know you was
sweet on him one time...

104
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:21,040
Sweeter than I shoulda been...
-Miss Simone messed herself.

105
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:25,280
Sweet Jesus! She got to stop
doing that, or it's diapers for her.

106
00:12:25,481 --> 00:12:30,681
-I'll be right there!
-C'mon, it's awful nice out here.

107
00:12:30,939 --> 00:12:34,480
Come out back for a moment,
take your mind off things.

108
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,980
What in God's name...!?

109
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,340
Oh, the Lord done
something here...!

110
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:54,080
I hope I didn't hurt it none,
steppin' on it like that.

111
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,920
We best leave that for
the police. -Oh, baby.

112
00:12:58,321 --> 00:12:59,921
I'll go.

113
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:04,122
It's for sure nobody wanted
to keep it. Come on, baby.

114
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,460
Quennie!
-Hold your water!

115
00:13:12,261 --> 00:13:14,261
I'll be back.

116
00:13:14,662 --> 00:13:17,162
She went and messed
herself all over again...

117
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,580
Jane Childress, start her a bath.

118
00:13:19,681 --> 00:13:21,981
And mind your own
business, Mrs Duprey.

119
00:13:22,082 --> 00:13:24,182
You'll be messing yourself
soon enough.

120
00:13:24,383 --> 00:13:26,383
Somebody stole my necklace.

121
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,620
OK, Mrs Hollister, I'll be right
with you. Go on back upstairs.

122
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:41,100
You are as ugly as an old pot,
but you still a child of God.

123
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,880
Queenie, she won't go
take a bath without you.

124
00:13:44,081 --> 00:13:47,081
Mercy... I'll be right there!

125
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:54,160
You just wait right
here for me, okay?

126
00:13:56,459 --> 00:14:00,300
My sister gave me those pearls.
I can't find them anywhere.

127
00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:02,940
Somebody's been
stealing my jewelry.

128
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,640
They are right here,
Mrs Hollister. See?

129
00:14:05,841 --> 00:14:09,441
Right around your pretty
white neck. Now come on.

130
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,980
Your heart is strong. You want
to avoid any undue stimulation.

131
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,780
I trust you ladies will
help me out with that?

132
00:14:28,751 --> 00:14:32,609
I've never seen anything like it,
nearly blind from cataracts.

133
00:14:32,817 --> 00:14:37,134
I'm not sure if he can hear,
bones indicate severe arthritis.

134
00:14:37,435 --> 00:14:41,736
His skin has lost all elasticity
and his hands and feet are ossified.

135
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,832
He shows all the deterioration,

136
00:14:45,033 --> 00:14:47,438
the infirmities not of
a newborn, but of a man

137
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:50,437
well in his eighties on his way
to the grave. -He's dying?

138
00:14:50,647 --> 00:14:54,252
His body's failing him
before his life's begun.

139
00:14:56,023 --> 00:14:59,032
Where did he come from?
-It's my sister's child.

140
00:14:59,175 --> 00:15:02,212
From Lafayette. She had
an unfortunate adventure.

141
00:15:02,413 --> 00:15:06,431
Poor child, he got the worse of it.
Come out white.

142
00:15:09,405 --> 00:15:14,078
There are places for 'unwanted'
babies like these, Queenie.

143
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:17,091
No room for another
mouth to feed here.

144
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:19,979
The Nolan Foundation,
despite their good intentions,

145
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:23,167
thinks this place is a large
nuisance as it is. A baby...

146
00:15:23,368 --> 00:15:25,456
You said he don't have long.

147
00:15:25,657 --> 00:15:29,726
Queenie, some creatures
aren't meant to survive.

148
00:15:33,045 --> 00:15:36,676
No, this baby here is a
miracle, that's for certain.

149
00:15:36,877 --> 00:15:40,477
Just not the kind of miracle
one hopes to see.

150
00:15:42,917 --> 00:15:46,882
Now listen! Listen up here!
We gonna have us a visitor

151
00:15:47,053 --> 00:15:50,625
that's gonna be staying
with us for a little while.

152
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:54,826
My sister had a child, but she
couldn't see right by it. So...

153
00:15:56,452 --> 00:15:58,673
He's known as...

154
00:16:01,277 --> 00:16:03,136
Benjamin.

155
00:16:03,437 --> 00:16:06,037
Benjamin...
He's not a well child,

156
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,793
so we're gonna have to
take good care of him.

157
00:16:08,994 --> 00:16:11,805
I had ten children, there's
not a baby I can't care for.

158
00:16:12,036 --> 00:16:14,211
Let me see him.

159
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:19,650
Oh, God in heaven, he looks
just like my ex husband.

160
00:16:20,084 --> 00:16:22,626
Look, he's prematurely old.

161
00:16:22,827 --> 00:16:26,681
Doctor Rose said he ain't got
much more time on this earth.

162
00:16:26,882 --> 00:16:29,132
Join the club.

163
00:16:33,133 --> 00:16:35,133
Oh, smile!

164
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:44,266
Hambert sends his
remembrances to you.

165
00:16:53,636 --> 00:16:56,561
Are you right out of your mind?

166
00:16:57,239 --> 00:17:01,007
I know you ain't got all the parts
it takes to make one of your own,

167
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:05,253
but this ain't yours to keep,
it may not even be human kind.

168
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,620
Mr Weathers, come back here!

169
00:17:18,084 --> 00:17:19,904
Please.

170
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:39,633
"You never know
what's comin' for you."

171
00:17:48,575 --> 00:17:51,440
It seemed I'd found a home.

172
00:17:53,821 --> 00:17:55,812
Is any of this true?

173
00:17:56,013 --> 00:17:58,954
You have such a lovely voice.

174
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:03,557
Mom, there's an ancient
streetcar token.

175
00:18:05,735 --> 00:18:09,043
That clock just kept going,

176
00:18:09,644 --> 00:18:13,599
year after year after year...

177
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:22,407
I didn't know I was a child.
-Same old crap every day.

178
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,239
I thought I was like
everyone else there.

179
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,498
An old man in a
twilight of his life.

180
00:18:32,881 --> 00:18:36,257
Stop bangin' that fork. It's used
for eating, not for playin' with.

181
00:18:36,431 --> 00:18:39,826
And use your napkin,
please Mr. Benjamin.

182
00:18:41,262 --> 00:18:43,100
Queenie!

183
00:18:54,598 --> 00:18:56,576
Hey, boy!

184
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,502
I always had a healthy curiosity.

185
00:19:06,703 --> 00:19:10,728
What was up the street,
or around the next corner?

186
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:17,398
Benjamin! That is dangerous.
Come back over here!

187
00:19:17,897 --> 00:19:20,156
Stay put, child!

188
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:26,161
I loved her very much.
She was my mother.

189
00:19:26,636 --> 00:19:29,345
Momma... momma!

190
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,440
Some days I feel different
than the day before.

191
00:19:35,572 --> 00:19:40,045
Everybody feels different about
themselves one way or another.

192
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:43,516
But we're all goin' the same way.

193
00:19:44,145 --> 00:19:47,788
Just taking different roads
to get there, that's all.

194
00:19:47,989 --> 00:19:51,209
You're on your own road,
Benjamin.

195
00:19:53,148 --> 00:19:56,295
Momma, how much longer I got?

196
00:19:56,474 --> 00:19:59,542
Just be thankful for
what you're given.

197
00:19:59,743 --> 00:20:03,198
You already here longer
than you supposed to.

198
00:20:05,721 --> 00:20:09,346
Some nights,
I'd have to sleep alone.

199
00:20:17,623 --> 00:20:22,064
I didn't mind. I would listen
to the house breathing.

200
00:20:23,769 --> 00:20:26,769
All those people sleeping.

201
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:30,270
I felt safe.

202
00:20:50,487 --> 00:20:53,420
It was a place of great routine.

203
00:20:53,621 --> 00:20:56,430
Every morning at 5:30
no matter the weather,

204
00:20:56,631 --> 00:21:00,651
General Winslow, US army
retired, raised the flag.

205
00:21:02,955 --> 00:21:07,435
Mrs Sybil Wagner, once an
opera singer of some note,

206
00:21:07,944 --> 00:21:10,849
well, she sang Wagner.

207
00:21:21,926 --> 00:21:23,938
Alright, c'mon.

208
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:27,573
We gotta put some life into
these old sticks for you.

209
00:21:27,774 --> 00:21:30,004
get you walkin'.

210
00:21:32,562 --> 00:21:37,040
No matter the season, supper
was served promptly at 5:30.

211
00:21:37,241 --> 00:21:40,174
Mol-asses...
-Molasses.

212
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:43,293
Molasses.

213
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:47,065
I learned to read
when I was five.

214
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:50,935
My grandfather was
a dresser for a famous actor.

215
00:21:51,136 --> 00:21:54,773
He brought home every
play for me to read.

216
00:21:55,874 --> 00:21:59,752
"Kind keepers of my
weak decaying age

217
00:22:00,514 --> 00:22:04,554
let dying Mortimer
here rest himself.

218
00:22:04,801 --> 00:22:07,801
Even like a man new
haled from the rack.

219
00:22:08,002 --> 00:22:11,002
So fare my limbs with
long imprisonment.

220
00:22:11,217 --> 00:22:15,112
And these gray locks,
the pursuivants of death,

221
00:22:15,313 --> 00:22:19,178
argue the end of
Edmund Mortimer."

222
00:22:22,395 --> 00:22:25,659
You thought I was
plain ignorant, didn't you?

223
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:30,300
The actor my grandfather worked
for was John Wilkes Booth.

224
00:22:31,346 --> 00:22:34,366
He killed Abraham Lincoln.

225
00:22:35,196 --> 00:22:38,396
You never know
what's coming for you.

226
00:22:38,747 --> 00:22:43,192
On saturday nights, momma
would make me go to church.

227
00:22:45,783 --> 00:22:47,476
Benjamin!

228
00:22:58,102 --> 00:22:59,756
Amen!

229
00:23:01,826 --> 00:23:04,841
What can I do for you, sister?

230
00:23:13,913 --> 00:23:17,113
Her parts are all
twisted up inside,

231
00:23:17,414 --> 00:23:20,414
she can't have little children.

232
00:23:23,207 --> 00:23:27,211
Lord, if you could see clear
to forgive this woman her sins

233
00:23:27,412 --> 00:23:30,020
so she can bear
the fruit of the womb.

234
00:23:30,221 --> 00:23:33,435
Out damnable affliction!
Praise God!

235
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:35,901
Hallelujah!

236
00:23:39,324 --> 00:23:42,529
And what's this old
man's irrediction?

237
00:23:43,727 --> 00:23:46,127
He's got the devil on his back,

238
00:23:46,328 --> 00:23:49,328
trying to ride him into
the grave before his time.

239
00:23:51,849 --> 00:23:54,920
Out, Zebuchar!
Out, Beelzebub!

240
00:23:56,781 --> 00:23:59,121
How old are you?

241
00:23:59,322 --> 00:24:02,122
Seven, but I look a lot older.

242
00:24:02,322 --> 00:24:05,607
God bless you.
He's seven!

243
00:24:08,757 --> 00:24:12,628
Now, this is a man with
optimism in his heart!

244
00:24:13,529 --> 00:24:15,584
Belief in his soul!

245
00:24:15,727 --> 00:24:18,939
We are all children
in the eyes of God!

246
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:22,000
We are gonna get you
out of that chair.

247
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,876
And we're gonna have you walk.
-It's all right.

248
00:24:27,393 --> 00:24:31,901
In the name of God's glory,
rise up!

249
00:24:33,247 --> 00:24:35,181
Come on!

250
00:24:38,482 --> 00:24:40,482
Come on, man!

251
00:24:42,963 --> 00:24:46,115
Now God is gonna see you
the rest of the way.

252
00:24:46,316 --> 00:24:48,731
He's gonna see this
little old man walk

253
00:24:48,932 --> 00:24:51,332
without the use of
a crutch or a cane.

254
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:56,132
He's gonna see that you walk from
faith and divine inspiration alone!

255
00:24:57,826 --> 00:24:59,896
Now walk.

256
00:25:01,998 --> 00:25:03,863
Don't touch him!

257
00:25:06,266 --> 00:25:08,534
Rise up, old man!

258
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,463
Rise up like Lazarus!

259
00:25:11,664 --> 00:25:14,064
I said rise up!

260
00:25:18,078 --> 00:25:19,697
Yes!

261
00:25:21,044 --> 00:25:23,119
Say hallelujah!

262
00:25:25,456 --> 00:25:28,277
Walk. Walk on.

263
00:25:34,276 --> 00:25:37,466
Now, when I look back on it,
it was miraculous.

264
00:25:37,667 --> 00:25:39,704
But you know the saying:

265
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:42,485
"The Lord giveth and
the Lord taketh away."

266
00:25:42,628 --> 00:25:45,461
Praise be to the Lord
on the highest...!

267
00:25:52,844 --> 00:25:55,789
There was so many birthdays.

268
00:25:57,631 --> 00:26:00,478
So we wouldn't run out,
we would spare the candles.

269
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:04,331
You know I don't like birthdays
and I don't like cake.

270
00:26:05,432 --> 00:26:09,496
And death was a common visitor.
People came and went.

271
00:26:10,917 --> 00:26:13,485
You always knew
when someone left us.

272
00:26:13,686 --> 00:26:16,661
There was a silence in the house.

273
00:26:30,163 --> 00:26:32,399
It was a wonderful
place to grow up.

274
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,856
I was with people who had shed all
the inconsequences of earlier life.

275
00:26:37,632 --> 00:26:40,373
Left wondering
about the weather,

276
00:26:40,574 --> 00:26:42,914
the temperature of a bath,

277
00:26:43,172 --> 00:26:46,142
the light at the end of the day.

278
00:26:49,647 --> 00:26:54,287
For everyone that died, someone
would come to take their place.

279
00:26:54,888 --> 00:26:57,427
I've been married five times.

280
00:26:57,628 --> 00:27:01,704
My first wife and I are captured
by neighbor tribe of cannibals.

281
00:27:02,205 --> 00:27:04,423
We escaped across the river.

282
00:27:04,624 --> 00:27:08,423
My wife, she can't swim,
so, sadly, she eaten.

283
00:27:08,724 --> 00:27:11,967
My second wife steps
on a cobra and dies.

284
00:27:12,168 --> 00:27:15,028
It was very bad luck
to be married to me.

285
00:27:15,229 --> 00:27:18,229
That's Mr Oti. He's an acquaintance
of an acquaintance of mine.

286
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,412
The next summer I'm captured...
-He's a pigmey.

287
00:27:20,613 --> 00:27:22,554
...with six others
by Baschiele tribe.

288
00:27:22,755 --> 00:27:25,134
They trade us for pigs,
shoes and beer

289
00:27:25,335 --> 00:27:28,265
to a very strange
american man.

290
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,971
I hear you're not so old
as you looking.

291
00:27:49,172 --> 00:27:51,422
You just foolin' everybody.

292
00:27:51,646 --> 00:27:54,774
What's the matter,
did you get Madjembe?

293
00:27:54,975 --> 00:27:57,886
What's madjembe?
-Worms.

294
00:27:58,187 --> 00:28:02,822
I don't think I have worms.
This is just how I am.

295
00:28:05,534 --> 00:28:08,384
Come, let's get a cold root beer.

296
00:28:08,631 --> 00:28:10,589
I found medication
under your pillow.

297
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:13,390
I'm not supposed to.
It's dangerous.

298
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:16,651
Who said that?
Come on, little man.

299
00:28:17,152 --> 00:28:18,969
Hurry up.

300
00:28:29,738 --> 00:28:31,777
Halt, please!

301
00:28:35,012 --> 00:28:39,650
Then I am in the monkey house
at Philadelphia Zoological Park.

302
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:43,581
Three thousand people
show up my first day.

303
00:28:44,623 --> 00:28:46,389
Look.

304
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:51,149
What's it like living
in a cage? -It stinks.

305
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:56,215
But the monkeys,
they do some tricks there.

306
00:28:56,885 --> 00:28:58,743
I throw a spear...

307
00:28:58,944 --> 00:29:02,144
wrestle with Kowali,
she is orangutan.

308
00:29:02,544 --> 00:29:04,799
When I'm not playing
with the monkeys,

309
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,770
they want me to run to the bars
in my cage, with my teeth.

310
00:29:18,467 --> 00:29:22,365
So then what did you do?
-Then I leave ZOO.

311
00:29:22,566 --> 00:29:26,361
Go here, go there,
wander most of the time.

312
00:29:26,762 --> 00:29:29,768
You were all alone?
-Plenty of time you'd be alone.

313
00:29:30,271 --> 00:29:34,071
When you're different like us,
it's gonna be that way.

314
00:29:36,915 --> 00:29:40,438
But I tell you a little secret.
Fat people, skinny people,

315
00:29:40,639 --> 00:29:44,639
tall people, white people...
they're just as alone as we are.

316
00:29:45,612 --> 00:29:48,612
But they are scared shitless.

317
00:29:54,148 --> 00:29:57,125
I think about the river
I grew up on.

318
00:29:57,326 --> 00:30:00,761
It would be nice to sit
by my river again.

319
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,180
Come. I have an appointment.

320
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,947
There's my little man.
You ready, sugar?

321
00:30:10,148 --> 00:30:12,427
Always ready.
Always ready.

322
00:30:13,986 --> 00:30:16,371
Filamena, mr Benjamin.

323
00:30:17,283 --> 00:30:20,238
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
-My pleasure, ma'am.

324
00:30:20,439 --> 00:30:22,639
You can find your own
way home, can't you?

325
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,340
Take the St. Charles
line to Napoleon.

326
00:30:52,956 --> 00:30:56,551
Where in God's name
have you been? Get in here!

327
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:01,493
Youre goin' to take my breath
away, you know that?

328
00:31:02,029 --> 00:31:05,269
Oh Lord, I was so
worried about you.

329
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:11,230
It had been the best
day of my life.

330
00:31:11,601 --> 00:31:13,966
How's her breathing?
-Shallow.

331
00:31:14,167 --> 00:31:16,270
They're sayin' it will
reach us in few hours.

332
00:31:16,471 --> 00:31:18,684
I gotta get my baby
and take him to my sister's.

333
00:31:18,885 --> 00:31:21,443
They say there's nothin' to worry
about here in the hospital.

334
00:31:21,644 --> 00:31:24,098
Nurses will be right here if you
need them. Are you okay?

335
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,324
Yeah, I'm okay, reading...

336
00:31:26,525 --> 00:31:28,946
I shouldn't be more
than an hour.

337
00:31:29,447 --> 00:31:32,169
Was there just company?

338
00:31:32,361 --> 00:31:35,237
It was just Dorothy leaving.

339
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:38,854
Go on, Caroline.

340
00:31:39,055 --> 00:31:42,312
On sundays, the families
would come and visit.

341
00:31:42,513 --> 00:31:45,320
It was Thanksgiving, 1930.

342
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:49,411
I met the person who
changed my life forever.

343
00:32:00,223 --> 00:32:02,515
Well, Benjamin...

344
00:32:02,516 --> 00:32:06,016
Might I say you are looking
strikingly youthful.

345
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:08,125
Good day, Mrs Fuller.

346
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:11,287
A single cane,
back straight as an arrow...

347
00:32:11,488 --> 00:32:14,088
What elixir have
you been drinking?

348
00:32:14,288 --> 00:32:17,883
-Thank you, Ma'am.
-Grandma, look at me!

349
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:23,814
That was really something!
Come on over here, you.

350
00:32:24,274 --> 00:32:29,235
This is my granddaughter Daisy.
This is mister...

351
00:32:29,896 --> 00:32:33,629
I'm afraid, Benjamin, I don't
rightly know your last name.

352
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,835
Benjamin is fine.

353
00:32:36,004 --> 00:32:38,661
I never forgot her blue eyes.

354
00:32:38,862 --> 00:32:41,903
Good people, supper is served.

355
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,922
Did you know turkeys
aren't really birds?

356
00:32:57,123 --> 00:32:59,756
-Why do you say that?
-They're in the pheasant family.

357
00:32:59,957 --> 00:33:04,031
They can hardly fly. Sad, don't
you think? Birds that can't fly.

358
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:08,648
I like birds that can't fly.
They are so delicious.

359
00:33:08,949 --> 00:33:11,949
-That's cruel.
-I have something to tell you all.

360
00:33:12,134 --> 00:33:15,159
While we're giving thanks
for God's blessings...

361
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,780
I've had a miracle happen.

362
00:33:17,981 --> 00:33:21,566
The Lord saw fit to
answer my prayers.

363
00:33:24,051 --> 00:33:27,304
What does she mean
"answers her prayers"?

364
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,530
She's gonna have a baby, silly.

365
00:33:31,322 --> 00:33:34,898
That's what my momma said when
I was gonna have a baby brother.

366
00:33:35,099 --> 00:33:37,606
But he didn't live long.

367
00:33:37,964 --> 00:33:40,969
Cause he didn't breathe right.

368
00:33:43,613 --> 00:33:47,148
...when he got his
beautiful hind legs

369
00:33:47,349 --> 00:33:51,166
just as big God Ngog
had promised.

370
00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:54,163
You can see that
it's five o'clock,

371
00:33:54,364 --> 00:33:57,764
because big God
Ngog's clock says so.

372
00:33:58,034 --> 00:34:00,182
Isn't that something?

373
00:34:00,383 --> 00:34:04,002
-Again. Read it again.
-Read it again, please.

374
00:34:04,303 --> 00:34:07,859
Alright. But afterwards,
you must go to bed.

375
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,095
I promise.

376
00:34:11,296 --> 00:34:13,496
Old Man Kangaroo...

377
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:19,932
Are you sleeping?

378
00:34:20,578 --> 00:34:23,978
-Who is that?
-It's me, Daisy.

379
00:34:24,913 --> 00:34:28,129
-Hi!
-Come on!

380
00:34:40,012 --> 00:34:45,244
Where are we going?
-Come on. Right in here.

381
00:34:55,387 --> 00:34:58,920
Here, you light it. -I'm not
supposed to play with matches.

382
00:34:59,121 --> 00:35:02,131
Don 't be a chicken.
Light it!

383
00:35:12,065 --> 00:35:16,045
I'll tell you a secret if
you'll tell me one. -Okay.

384
00:35:16,499 --> 00:35:20,195
I saw my momma
kissing another man.

385
00:35:20,396 --> 00:35:22,996
Her face was red from it.

386
00:35:24,609 --> 00:35:26,676
Your turn.

387
00:35:29,441 --> 00:35:33,321
I'm not as old as I look.
-I thought so.

388
00:35:34,991 --> 00:35:39,636
You don't seem like an old
person. Like my grandma.

389
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:43,831
-I'm not.
-Are you sick?

390
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:47,670
Well, I heard momma
and Tizzy whisper

391
00:35:47,871 --> 00:35:50,771
and they said I was
gonna die soon.

392
00:35:50,999 --> 00:35:53,430
But maybe not.

393
00:35:54,217 --> 00:35:56,312
You're odd.

394
00:35:56,623 --> 00:36:00,168
You're different than
anybody I've ever met.

395
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:05,336
May I? -Okay.

396
00:36:11,276 --> 00:36:13,856
What are you doing
under there?

397
00:36:14,092 --> 00:36:17,380
You come right out here
and get back up to bed.

398
00:36:17,581 --> 00:36:19,581
It's after midnight!

399
00:36:19,759 --> 00:36:23,179
You are not to be playing
together. -Yes, ma'am.

400
00:36:23,244 --> 00:36:25,834
Now you get back to bed, little lady.

401
00:36:25,923 --> 00:36:30,473
You're too young to be wandering around 
in the night on your own.

402
00:36:32,405 --> 00:36:36,345
And you
ought to be ashamed of yourself!

403
00:36:51,489 --> 00:36:54,849
You are a different child,
a manchild. And, Baby,

404
00:36:56,376 --> 00:37:00,676
people aren't gonna understand
just how different you are.

405
00:37:06,572 --> 00:37:08,372
What's wrong with me?

406
00:37:09,225 --> 00:37:10,825
Come here.

407
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:17,550
***, baby.

408
00:37:20,626 --> 00:37:25,426
Now go on to bed, huh?
And behave yourself. Go.

409
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,420
***

410
00:37:39,247 --> 00:37:43,587
Did I ever tell you I've been struck
by lightning seven times

411
00:37:46,245 --> 00:37:49,046
Once when I was repairing 
a leak on the roof.

412
00:37:52,864 --> 00:37:56,664
Once I've just been 
crossing the road to get the mail.

413
00:38:12,439 --> 00:38:15,239
I never forgot ****

414
00:38:16,184 --> 00:38:17,484
Mom?

415
00:38:18,097 --> 00:38:21,497
Did you get the dispension that I left you
from first time that he saw you?

416
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:27,227
Not many people experience that.

417
00:38:27,728 --> 00:38:30,170
You want me to go on?

418
00:38:33,846 --> 00:38:38,046
When that baby came...
things were different.

419
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:49,072
Babies were born, people died.

420
00:38:49,144 --> 00:38:51,944
A lot of folks have been 
doing that in the house.

421
00:38:53,797 --> 00:38:55,597
I've come to say goodbye.

422
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,230
I'm going away.

423
00:38:57,764 --> 00:39:00,164
Going?
Where?

424
00:39:00,818 --> 00:39:05,318
I haven't figured that out yet, but I'll
send you a postcard when I get there.

425
00:39:05,429 --> 00:39:06,953
What about your friend?
The tall lady?

426
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:08,610
We're not friends anymore.

427
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,955
That's what happens with
tall people sometimes.

428
00:39:12,279 --> 00:39:14,971
Well... goodbye.

429
00:39:33,067 --> 00:39:36,727
I spent a lot of time
by myself that year.

430
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,272
Hello?

431
00:39:40,168 --> 00:39:42,245
-Hi. -I'm moving in today.

432
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:44,960
Welcome. We've been
expecting you.

433
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:48,310
Can you please show her up
to Mrs Rousseau's old room?

434
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:51,866
I'm sorry, but we usually
don't allow dogs in the house.

435
00:39:52,067 --> 00:39:55,033
Well, she's old as the hills,
she's almost blind.

436
00:39:55,234 --> 00:39:57,234
She won't be a
bother much longer.

437
00:39:57,734 --> 00:40:01,732
Well, alright, as long as she
stays out from underfoot.

438
00:40:02,926 --> 00:40:06,034
As hard as I try,
I can't remember her name.

439
00:40:06,235 --> 00:40:11,325
Mrs Lawson, or Mrs Hartford,
or maybe it was Maple?

440
00:40:11,838 --> 00:40:14,722
It's funny how sometimes the
people we remember the least

441
00:40:14,923 --> 00:40:17,804
make the greatest
impression on us.

442
00:40:18,005 --> 00:40:20,186
I do remember
she wore diamonds.

443
00:40:20,387 --> 00:40:23,859
And she always dressed in fine
clothing as if she's going out.

444
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:28,549
Although she never did and
nobody ever came to visit her.

445
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:32,555
She taught me
to play the piano.

446
00:40:37,291 --> 00:40:40,091
It's not about
how well you play,

447
00:40:40,292 --> 00:40:43,292
it's how you feel about
what you're playing.

448
00:40:43,465 --> 00:40:45,504
Try this.

449
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,870
You cannot help but put
yourself into the music.

450
00:41:12,522 --> 00:41:17,517
There were many changes. Some
you could see, some your couldn't.

451
00:41:18,748 --> 00:41:21,967
Hair started growing
in all sorts of places.

452
00:41:22,168 --> 00:41:24,843
Along with other things.

453
00:41:25,517 --> 00:41:28,289
I felt pretty good, considering.

454
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:33,662
Oh, darlin', the pain.
-Alright mom, I'll get the nurse.

455
00:41:37,063 --> 00:41:40,263
Look at this eye.
This is a major hurricane.

456
00:41:43,038 --> 00:41:45,523
Not doing too good?

457
00:41:45,807 --> 00:41:49,082
Nobody seems to know
whether to stay or leave.

458
00:41:49,283 --> 00:41:51,863
I'm gonna ride it out.

459
00:41:52,064 --> 00:41:55,464
There, that should make
things much easier.

460
00:41:57,695 --> 00:42:00,742
Have you had a chance
to say your goodbyes?

461
00:42:00,943 --> 00:42:04,590
My father waited 4 hours for my
brother to get here from Boger City.

462
00:42:04,791 --> 00:42:06,930
Couldn't go without him.

463
00:42:07,131 --> 00:42:10,246
She seems like a sweet woman.
-Yeah.

464
00:42:10,447 --> 00:42:13,714
I haven't had as much time
with her... -Are you busy?

465
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,985
-Excuse me.
-Sure.

466
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:36,809
Queenie would let me go with
Mr Daws to Poverty Point,

467
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:39,829
to watch the boats go
up and down the river.

468
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:42,555
These were hard times.

469
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:48,775
Did I ever tell you I was struck
by lightning seven times?

470
00:42:49,276 --> 00:42:53,076
Once when I was in the field
just tending to my cows.

471
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:02,315
My fourt' hand didn't show up.

472
00:43:03,812 --> 00:43:08,045
Anybody wanna make 2 $
for a day's work around here?

473
00:43:09,146 --> 00:43:11,026
What's the matter?

474
00:43:11,262 --> 00:43:14,062
Nobody wants to do an honest day's
work for an honest day's pay?

475
00:43:14,263 --> 00:43:16,253
He never pays.

476
00:43:16,767 --> 00:43:19,832
Nobody wants the job?
-I do.

477
00:43:20,743 --> 00:43:23,668
You got your sea legs, old man?

478
00:43:24,672 --> 00:43:26,525
I think.

479
00:43:29,927 --> 00:43:32,279
That's good enough for me.

480
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:36,569
Get your ass on board,
we'll sure as hell find out!

481
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:44,568
I was as happy as I could be.
-I need a volunteer!

482
00:43:44,792 --> 00:43:47,299
I would do anything.
-Yes, captain!

483
00:43:47,672 --> 00:43:51,387
-Scrape off all this bird shit.
-Right away, sir.

484
00:43:53,274 --> 00:43:58,313
I was actually goin' to be paid for
something I would've done for free.

485
00:43:59,214 --> 00:44:02,114
His name was
captain Mike Clark.

486
00:44:02,315 --> 00:44:05,515
He'd been on a tugboat
since he was seven.

487
00:44:06,327 --> 00:44:08,212
Get movin'!

488
00:44:09,282 --> 00:44:11,204
Come here.

489
00:44:12,959 --> 00:44:16,296
Could you... still get it up?

490
00:44:17,303 --> 00:44:19,931
I do every morning.

491
00:44:20,171 --> 00:44:23,177
The old pole? The hard'n?

492
00:44:23,978 --> 00:44:25,978
I guess.

493
00:44:27,837 --> 00:44:31,382
When was the last time
you had a woman?

494
00:44:32,897 --> 00:44:35,339
Never. -Never?

495
00:44:35,661 --> 00:44:37,950
Not that I know of, sir.

496
00:44:38,151 --> 00:44:40,236
Wait a minute!

497
00:44:40,655 --> 00:44:45,268
You mean to say, you've been on
this earth for how many years,

498
00:44:45,469 --> 00:44:48,429
and you never had a woman?

499
00:44:53,074 --> 00:44:57,108
Damn! That's the saddest
thing I ever heard in my life.

500
00:44:57,409 --> 00:45:00,254
Never? -No.

501
00:45:03,388 --> 00:45:07,475
Then, by Jesus,
you are comin' with me.

502
00:45:18,347 --> 00:45:21,983
-What did your father do?
-I never met my father.

503
00:45:22,184 --> 00:45:24,392
You lucky bastard!

504
00:45:24,874 --> 00:45:28,259
All father's gonna do
is hold you down.

505
00:45:30,224 --> 00:45:33,764
Out on my father's boat,
working da two-a-days.

506
00:45:33,965 --> 00:45:37,928
This little fat bastard,
"tug Irish" they call him.

507
00:45:39,259 --> 00:45:42,190
I finally get up the
nerves and tell him:

508
00:45:42,391 --> 00:45:46,408
"I don't wanna spend da rest of
my life on a goddamn tugboat!"

509
00:45:46,609 --> 00:45:48,609
You know what I'm sayin'?

510
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:51,590
You don't wanna spend the rest
of your life on a tugboat.

511
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:54,064
Absolutely, damn right!

512
00:45:56,443 --> 00:45:59,860
And you know what
my father says to me?

513
00:46:00,061 --> 00:46:04,161
He says: "Who the hell
do you think you are?"

514
00:46:04,406 --> 00:46:07,806
"What the hell do you
think you can do?"

515
00:46:08,007 --> 00:46:09,807
I tell him:

516
00:46:10,074 --> 00:46:13,654
"Well, if you're askin'..."

517
00:46:15,151 --> 00:46:18,051
"I wanna be an artist."

518
00:46:18,352 --> 00:46:21,352
He laughs... "An artist?"

519
00:46:21,718 --> 00:46:25,243
"God meant for you to work
a tugboat just like me."

520
00:46:25,444 --> 00:46:28,669
"And that's exactly
what you're gonna do."

521
00:46:28,965 --> 00:46:32,180
Well, I turned myself
into an artist.

522
00:46:33,766 --> 00:46:35,986
A tattoo artist!

523
00:46:38,191 --> 00:46:42,026
I put on every one
of these myself.

524
00:46:43,593 --> 00:46:48,022
You have to skin me alive to
take my art away from me now!

525
00:46:48,223 --> 00:46:52,208
When I'm dead, I'm gonna
send him my arm.

526
00:46:53,009 --> 00:46:55,009
That one.

527
00:46:56,289 --> 00:46:59,232
Don't let anyone
tell you different!

528
00:46:59,433 --> 00:47:01,752
You gotta do what
you're meant to do.

529
00:47:01,953 --> 00:47:05,553
And I happen to be
a god-damned artist!

530
00:47:05,754 --> 00:47:08,254
But you're a tugboat captain.

531
00:47:08,754 --> 00:47:13,199
Captain Mike, we're ready
for you and your friend.

532
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,074
Go, old timer.
Break your cherry.

533
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,060
Hello, ladies!

534
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:26,265
Hi.

535
00:47:26,466 --> 00:47:30,161
He gives me the willies.
That is not for me.

536
00:47:31,254 --> 00:47:34,116
How are you tonight, grandpa?

537
00:47:34,317 --> 00:47:37,267
It was a night to remember.

538
00:47:41,948 --> 00:47:46,198
What are you, Dick Tracy or
something? I've got to rest.

539
00:47:46,899 --> 00:47:48,779
I can't.

540
00:47:49,401 --> 00:47:51,800
Thank you. -No, thank you.
Have a nice night.

541
00:47:52,001 --> 00:47:54,458
-Will you be here tomorrow?
-Every night but sunday.

542
00:47:54,678 --> 00:47:58,762
It sure made me understand
the value of earning a living.

543
00:48:00,276 --> 00:48:03,166
Things money can buy you.

544
00:48:20,396 --> 00:48:25,396
It's nasty out. Can I offer
you a ride somewhere?

545
00:48:27,192 --> 00:48:30,182
That's awfully kind of you, sir.

546
00:48:38,584 --> 00:48:42,786
My name is Thomas. Thomas Button.
-I'm Benjamin.

547
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:46,508
Benjamin... it's a
pleasure to know you.

548
00:48:48,699 --> 00:48:52,070
Would you like to stop
somewhere and have a drink?

549
00:48:52,271 --> 00:48:54,051
All right.

550
00:48:54,407 --> 00:48:56,105
Evening.

551
00:49:01,541 --> 00:49:05,771
-What will it be, sir?
-I'll have whatever he's having.

552
00:49:05,972 --> 00:49:09,835
A Sazerac for both of us.
With whiskey, not brandy.

553
00:49:10,036 --> 00:49:13,108
You don't drink, do you?
-It's a night for firsts.

554
00:49:13,309 --> 00:49:17,389
-How's that? -I've never
been to a brothel, either.

555
00:49:18,062 --> 00:49:20,616
-It's an experience.
-Certainly is.

556
00:49:20,817 --> 00:49:23,791
There's a first time for
everything. -Sure enough.

557
00:49:23,992 --> 00:49:26,019
Your drinks.

558
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:31,704
I don't mean to be rude...
but your hands, is that painful?

559
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:36,290
I was born with some form of
disease. -What kind of disease?

560
00:49:36,491 --> 00:49:38,825
I was born old.

561
00:49:39,756 --> 00:49:44,026
-I'm sorry. -No need to be.
Nothing wrong with old age.

562
00:49:52,973 --> 00:49:56,603
My wife passed away
many years ago.

563
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:59,820
I'm so so sorry.

564
00:50:00,804 --> 00:50:03,335
She died in childbirth.

565
00:50:06,149 --> 00:50:09,244
To children.
-To mothers.

566
00:50:13,597 --> 00:50:17,477
What line of work are you in,
Mr Button? -Buttons.

567
00:50:17,678 --> 00:50:21,911
Button's Buttons. There isn't
a button we don't make.

568
00:50:22,212 --> 00:50:26,922
Our biggest competition is B.F.
Goodrich and his infernal zippers.

569
00:50:27,123 --> 00:50:29,206
Would you gentlemen
like anything else?

570
00:50:29,407 --> 00:50:31,699
One for the road, Benjamin?

571
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:35,700
Only if you let me
pay for it, Mr Button.

572
00:50:36,184 --> 00:50:39,275
So, what line of
work do you do?

573
00:50:39,576 --> 00:50:42,376
I'm a tugboat man.

574
00:50:48,329 --> 00:50:52,565
I enjoyed talking to you.
-I enjoyed drinking with you.

575
00:50:56,364 --> 00:50:58,049
Benjamin...

576
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:01,450
would you mind if, time to time,
I stop by and say hello?

577
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:05,348
Anytime.
Good night, Mr Button.

578
00:51:05,549 --> 00:51:08,611
Good night, Benjamin.
Drive off.

579
00:51:14,776 --> 00:51:16,802
Where have you been?

580
00:51:17,003 --> 00:51:21,883
Nothing. I met some people
and listened to music...

581
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:26,736
Oh, sweet Jesus, boy!

582
00:51:27,306 --> 00:51:30,799
Growing up is a funny thing.
Sneaks up on you.

583
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:33,323
One person is there
and then suddenly

584
00:51:33,524 --> 00:51:35,624
somebody else is
taking their place.

585
00:51:36,124 --> 00:51:38,243
She wasn't all elbows
and knees anymore.

586
00:51:38,444 --> 00:51:41,249
-Benjamin! Come on.
-Okay.

587
00:51:42,771 --> 00:51:44,771
I loved those weekends
when she'd come

588
00:51:44,972 --> 00:51:47,172
and spend the night
with her grandmother.

589
00:51:55,158 --> 00:51:57,535
Daisy! Daisy!

590
00:51:58,970 --> 00:52:01,510
You wanna see something?

591
00:52:02,438 --> 00:52:04,542
You gotta keep it a secret.

592
00:52:04,743 --> 00:52:08,173
Get dressed.
I'll meet you out back.

593
00:52:12,393 --> 00:52:14,467
Come on!

594
00:52:15,884 --> 00:52:18,965
Can you swim?
-I can do anything you can do.

595
00:52:19,166 --> 00:52:21,741
Put this on. We gotta hurry.

596
00:52:34,676 --> 00:52:37,491
Is he okay? -Captain!

597
00:52:39,236 --> 00:52:41,321
Captain Mike!

598
00:52:44,694 --> 00:52:48,106
Morning, captain.
Can you take us out?

599
00:52:48,307 --> 00:52:51,786
Do you know what day it is?
-Sunday.

600
00:52:51,987 --> 00:52:54,962
You know what that means?

601
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:58,515
It means that I was
very drunk last night.

602
00:52:58,691 --> 00:53:01,491
You're drunk every night.

603
00:53:03,282 --> 00:53:07,485
Is that a girl? -A close friend.
I want to show her the river.

604
00:53:07,701 --> 00:53:11,601
I'm not supposed to go
joy-ridin' with civilians.

605
00:53:11,802 --> 00:53:14,602
I could lose my licence.

606
00:53:23,989 --> 00:53:26,964
What are you waiting for?

607
00:53:55,885 --> 00:53:59,890
She put in for repair.
A wounded duck.

608
00:54:00,291 --> 00:54:03,156
She's flyin' now!

609
00:54:09,122 --> 00:54:12,277
I wish we could go with them.

610
00:54:17,312 --> 00:54:20,282
Did you say something, mom?

611
00:54:27,562 --> 00:54:30,197
It's getting really bad.

612
00:54:31,465 --> 00:54:33,960
Can you hear me, mom?

613
00:54:35,679 --> 00:54:38,974
Time just seeped out of me.

614
00:54:45,044 --> 00:54:47,526
Things were changing quickly.

615
00:54:47,727 --> 00:54:52,578
I don't know how it's possible,
but you seem to have more hair.

616
00:54:52,979 --> 00:54:55,538
What if I told you that
I wasn't getting older,

617
00:54:55,739 --> 00:54:59,344
but I was getting younger
than everybody else.

618
00:54:59,778 --> 00:55:02,953
Well, I'd feel sorry for you.

619
00:55:03,254 --> 00:55:06,260
To have to see everybody
you love die before you do.

620
00:55:06,461 --> 00:55:08,550
It's an awful responsibility.

621
00:55:08,751 --> 00:55:12,651
I've never thought about life
or death that way before.

622
00:55:13,562 --> 00:55:17,752
Benjamin, we're meant to
lose the people we love.

623
00:55:17,989 --> 00:55:22,004
How else would we know
how important they are to us.

624
00:55:24,523 --> 00:55:29,173
And one fall day, a familiar
visitor came knocking on our door.

625
00:55:30,711 --> 00:55:33,926
You wanna go with me
to the drugstore?

626
00:55:43,729 --> 00:55:47,204
She taught me how to
play the piano. -Amen!

627
00:55:47,573 --> 00:55:51,563
And she taught me what
it meant to miss somebody.

628
00:55:55,258 --> 00:55:57,213
Let's go.

629
00:55:57,662 --> 00:56:01,847
I had gone to a brothel,
I had my first drink,

630
00:56:02,048 --> 00:56:05,898
Said goodbye to one friend
and burried another.

631
00:56:06,299 --> 00:56:10,959
In 1936, when I was coming to the
end of the 17th year of my life,

632
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:14,825
I packed my bag
and said goodbye.

633
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:19,302
I knew, life being what it was,

634
00:56:19,503 --> 00:56:22,943
I'd probably never
see them again.

635
00:56:24,936 --> 00:56:28,081
Good luck to you, son.
-Thanks.

636
00:56:32,001 --> 00:56:35,704
-I love you, mom.
-I love you too, baby.

637
00:56:36,105 --> 00:56:40,140
I want you to say your
prayers every night, hear?

638
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:46,214
Be safe!

639
00:56:57,696 --> 00:56:59,391
Benjamin!

640
00:57:01,967 --> 00:57:05,217
Where are you going?
-Off to sea.

641
00:57:05,978 --> 00:57:08,783
I'll send you a postcard.

642
00:57:09,861 --> 00:57:11,873
From everywhere.

643
00:57:12,127 --> 00:57:15,577
Write me a postcard
from everywhere.

644
00:57:29,054 --> 00:57:31,536
Can you imagine?

645
00:57:33,482 --> 00:57:39,282
He sent me a postcard
from everywhere he went.

646
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:43,928
Every place he worked.

647
00:57:44,429 --> 00:57:50,429
Newfoundland, Baffin Bay,
Glasgow, Liverpool, Narvik...

648
00:57:51,988 --> 00:57:56,019
He had gone with
that captain Mike.

649
00:57:58,675 --> 00:58:01,842
Captain Mike had contracted for
three years with Moran Brothers

650
00:58:02,043 --> 00:58:05,043
Tug and Salvage. The old
ship had been refitted

651
00:58:05,243 --> 00:58:07,677
with a diesel engine
and a new sea winch.

652
00:58:07,878 --> 00:58:10,692
We went around Florida
and up the Atlantic seaboard.

653
00:58:10,893 --> 00:58:14,112
We were a crew of seven now.
Captain Mike and me,

654
00:58:14,313 --> 00:58:17,335
the cookie, Prentiss Mayes
from Wilmington, Delaware.

655
00:58:17,536 --> 00:58:20,560
The Brody twins, Rick and Vic
who got along fine at sea,

656
00:58:20,761 --> 00:58:23,654
but for some reason,
once they were on dry land,

657
00:58:23,855 --> 00:58:26,288
couldn't stand the sight
of each other. -Enough!

658
00:58:26,418 --> 00:58:28,847
One in every eight
boats never returns...

659
00:58:29,048 --> 00:58:31,209
There was John Grimm,
who sure fit his name.

660
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:33,157
...all hands lost at sea.

661
00:58:33,358 --> 00:58:36,353
From Belvedere,
South Dakota.

662
00:58:36,873 --> 00:58:39,729
And Pleasant Curtis
from Nashville,

663
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:43,940
who never said a word
to anyone, except himself.

664
00:58:45,274 --> 00:58:48,252
I wrote him constantly.

665
00:58:49,569 --> 00:58:54,674
I told him I had been invited
to audition in New York City,

666
00:58:54,875 --> 00:58:57,732
for the School of American Ballet.

667
00:58:57,933 --> 00:59:01,609
Please stay. Thank you.
Thank you.

668
00:59:03,675 --> 00:59:05,710
You can stay.

669
00:59:07,455 --> 00:59:13,041
I was relegated to the "corps".
Another dancing gypsy.

670
00:59:17,614 --> 00:59:21,668
Benjamin, how is it
when you showed up,

671
00:59:21,869 --> 00:59:26,145
you were no bigger than a bollard
with one foot in the grave.

672
00:59:26,446 --> 00:59:30,846
Now... either I drink a helluva
lot more than I think I do,

673
00:59:31,421 --> 00:59:35,471
or you sprouted!
What's your secret?

674
00:59:37,364 --> 00:59:39,756
Well, Captain...

675
00:59:40,653 --> 00:59:43,328
you do drink a lot.

676
00:59:47,178 --> 00:59:51,633
We stayed in a small hotel with the
grand name, "The Winter Palace."

677
00:59:51,934 --> 00:59:54,554
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

678
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:58,405
The hummingbird is
not just another bird.

679
00:59:58,646 --> 01:00:02,611
Its heart rate is
1,200 beats a minute.

680
01:00:03,997 --> 01:00:07,722
Its wings beat
80 times a second.

681
01:00:08,881 --> 01:00:12,361
If you was to stop
their wings from beatin,

682
01:00:12,708 --> 01:00:16,080
they would be dead in
less that ten seconds.

683
01:00:16,481 --> 01:00:21,281
This is no ordinary bird,
this is a frikkin' miracle!

684
01:00:25,032 --> 01:00:29,276
They slowed down their wings
with moving pictures,

685
01:00:29,677 --> 01:00:35,363
and you know what they saw?
Their wingtips are doing...

686
01:00:39,086 --> 01:00:44,286
You know what the figure "8"
is the mathematical symbol for?

687
01:00:47,255 --> 01:00:49,267
Infinity!

688
01:00:52,614 --> 01:00:55,682
Everybody, no matter
what differences they had,

689
01:00:55,883 --> 01:00:59,958
languages, the color of their skin,
had one thing in common:

690
01:01:00,181 --> 01:01:02,772
They were drunk
every single night.

691
01:01:04,573 --> 01:01:07,839
Could you hold the lift, please?
-Thank you very much.

692
01:01:08,428 --> 01:01:11,098
Her name was Elizabeth Abbott.

693
01:01:11,299 --> 01:01:14,597
She was not beautiful.
She was plain as paper.

694
01:01:14,798 --> 01:01:18,361
But she was pretty
as any picture to me.

695
01:01:18,662 --> 01:01:21,342
What are you looking at?

696
01:01:22,903 --> 01:01:25,861
If you must know, we have
a long standing agreement

697
01:01:26,062 --> 01:01:29,055
never to go to bed sober.
Isn't that right, honey?

698
01:01:29,256 --> 01:01:32,246
-Whatever you say, darling.
-Her husband was Walter Abbott.

699
01:01:32,447 --> 01:01:35,647
He was Chief Minister of the
British Trade Mission in Murmansk.

700
01:01:35,848 --> 01:01:38,248
And he was a spy.

701
01:01:40,323 --> 01:01:43,143
Are you okay, darling?
-Oh yes.

702
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:49,900
I broke my heel off
one of my shoes.

703
01:01:50,101 --> 01:01:53,901
I'm not in a habit of walking
about in my stocking feet.

704
01:01:58,307 --> 01:02:01,247
They were long days there.

705
01:02:07,828 --> 01:02:10,558
And even longer nights.

706
01:02:12,072 --> 01:02:16,542
One particular night, I was
having trouble sleeping.

707
01:02:17,201 --> 01:02:19,205
I'm sorry.

708
01:02:20,290 --> 01:02:22,710
I couldn't sleep.

709
01:02:35,267 --> 01:02:39,154
I was gonna make some tea.
Would you like some?

710
01:02:39,455 --> 01:02:41,536
No, thank you.

711
01:03:19,235 --> 01:03:23,320
-Milk? Honey?
-A bit of honey, please.

712
01:03:23,938 --> 01:03:28,074
I hope you like flies in your
honey. -Oh, perhaps not.

713
01:03:42,445 --> 01:03:46,572
Maybe... better to
let it steep a little.

714
01:03:47,273 --> 01:03:50,048
Steep? -Soak.

715
01:03:50,312 --> 01:03:54,234
I don't know, I mean... there's
a proper way of making tea.

716
01:03:54,535 --> 01:03:58,094
Where I'm from,
people just want it to be hot.

717
01:03:58,332 --> 01:04:00,767
Well, quite right.

718
01:04:08,507 --> 01:04:10,713
You're a seaman?
-Sailor.

719
01:04:10,914 --> 01:04:13,685
I hope I'm not being impolite,
but I have to ask:

720
01:04:13,886 --> 01:04:16,141
Aren't you a little old
to be working on a boat?

721
01:04:16,342 --> 01:04:20,272
There's no age limit,
as long as you can do the work.

722
01:04:30,263 --> 01:04:32,813
And you have trouble
sleeping? Thank you.

723
01:04:33,014 --> 01:04:36,070
I didn't think I did.
I usually sleep like a baby.

724
01:04:36,671 --> 01:04:39,401
Something kept me up.

725
01:04:40,495 --> 01:04:42,631
My father, in his eighties,

726
01:04:42,832 --> 01:04:45,732
he was so convinced
he's gonna die in his sleep,

727
01:04:45,932 --> 01:04:49,200
he limited himself to
having afternoon naps.

728
01:04:49,752 --> 01:04:53,271
He was so determined
he was gonna cheat death.

729
01:04:53,472 --> 01:04:57,567
Did he? -Did he what?
-Die in his sleep?

730
01:04:58,736 --> 01:05:01,415
He died sitting in
his favorite chair,

731
01:05:01,616 --> 01:05:04,216
listening to his favorite
program on the wireless.

732
01:05:04,516 --> 01:05:07,601
He must have known something.

733
01:05:12,453 --> 01:05:14,846
My husband is
British Trade Minister,

734
01:05:15,047 --> 01:05:17,947
and we've been here
for fourteen months.

735
01:05:18,147 --> 01:05:21,580
-Good God! -We were
supposed to go to Peking.

736
01:05:21,781 --> 01:05:27,475
But it never seemed to work out.
Have you been in the Far East?

737
01:05:27,876 --> 01:05:32,305
No. I've never been anywhere,
really. I mean outside harbors.

738
01:05:32,811 --> 01:05:37,611
And where is it that you're from?
-New Orleans, Louisiana.

739
01:05:38,419 --> 01:05:41,799
I didn't know
there was another.

740
01:05:43,158 --> 01:05:46,644
And she told me about
all the places she had been.

741
01:05:46,845 --> 01:05:49,325
What she had seen.

742
01:05:49,659 --> 01:05:53,264
And we talked till
just before the dawn.

743
01:05:55,268 --> 01:06:00,548
And we went back to our rooms,
to our separate lives.

744
01:06:05,712 --> 01:06:09,787
But every night, we'd
meet again in that lobby.

745
01:06:14,281 --> 01:06:18,561
A hotel in the middle of the
night can be a magical place.

746
01:06:21,162 --> 01:06:24,337
A mouse running and stopping.

747
01:06:25,501 --> 01:06:29,781
A radiator hissing.
A curtain blowing.

748
01:06:34,423 --> 01:06:37,423
There's something peaceful,
even comforting,

749
01:06:37,624 --> 01:06:40,824
knowing that people you love
are asleep in their beds,

750
01:06:41,046 --> 01:06:44,131
where nothing can harm them.

751
01:06:46,243 --> 01:06:49,643
Elizabeth and I would
lose track of the night,

752
01:06:49,844 --> 01:06:52,644
till just before daybreak.

753
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:57,303
I think I may have given you
the wrong impression.

754
01:06:57,504 --> 01:06:59,558
I beg your pardon?

755
01:06:59,737 --> 01:07:02,345
Well, married women don't
customarily sit around

756
01:07:02,546 --> 01:07:05,247
in the middle of the night
with strange men in hotels.

757
01:07:05,448 --> 01:07:09,703
I wouldn't know what a married
woman does and doesn't do.

758
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:16,459
Good night!

759
01:07:18,148 --> 01:07:20,175
Murmansk.

760
01:07:22,213 --> 01:07:26,218
"I've met somebody and
I've fallen in love." Mom?

761
01:07:30,295 --> 01:07:33,350
That was over 60 years ago.

762
01:07:34,051 --> 01:07:38,651
-Did you love him, mother?
-What does a girl know about love?

763
01:08:15,344 --> 01:08:20,039
I'm not dressed. -You look
splendid just as you are.

764
01:08:21,311 --> 01:08:25,167
Don't waste any time bothering
about the wine or the cheese

765
01:08:25,368 --> 01:08:29,228
in Murmansk, cause they are
really completely ordinary.

766
01:08:29,473 --> 01:08:33,273
But the caviar and the vodka

767
01:08:33,474 --> 01:08:37,874
are sublime and plentiful.

768
01:08:41,131 --> 01:08:42,735
So...

769
01:08:47,761 --> 01:08:52,391
Savor it... and don't
eat it all at once.

770
01:08:53,146 --> 01:08:57,116
Because that way, there's
nothing left to enjoy.

771
01:08:58,121 --> 01:09:02,721
Now take a little swallow of vodka
while it's still in your mouth.

772
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:05,222
Nazdrovia.

773
01:09:17,241 --> 01:09:20,918
You haven't been with
many women, have you?

774
01:09:21,219 --> 01:09:23,880
Not on sundays.

775
01:09:25,072 --> 01:09:29,667
And you've never had a girlfriend
before, have you? -No ma'am.

776
01:09:34,491 --> 01:09:38,891
When I was nineteen,
I attempted to become

777
01:09:39,092 --> 01:09:43,492
the first woman ever to
swim the English Channel.

778
01:09:44,172 --> 01:09:45,861
Really?

779
01:09:46,105 --> 01:09:49,334
But the current that day
was so strong that...

780
01:09:49,549 --> 01:09:53,071
for every stroke I took,
I was pushed back two.

781
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:56,472
I was in the water
for 32 hours.

782
01:09:56,673 --> 01:10:00,473
And when I was
two miles from Calais,

783
01:10:01,858 --> 01:10:04,434
it started to rain.

784
01:10:06,786 --> 01:10:10,084
When I couldn't go any further,

785
01:10:10,785 --> 01:10:12,985
I stopped.

786
01:10:13,763 --> 01:10:16,004
I just stopped.

787
01:10:16,238 --> 01:10:20,843
And everybody asked me
would I try again.

788
01:10:21,529 --> 01:10:24,089
Why wouldn't I?

789
01:10:26,467 --> 01:10:29,862
I never did.
As a matter of fact,

790
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:34,168
I've never done anything
with my life after that.

791
01:10:37,771 --> 01:10:40,416
Your hands are so coarse.

792
01:10:50,394 --> 01:10:53,839
I can feel the wind
in your cheeks.

793
01:10:59,753 --> 01:11:02,933
I'm afraid it's
the witching hour.

794
01:11:07,844 --> 01:11:11,738
It was the first time
a woman had ever kissed me.

795
01:11:11,939 --> 01:11:15,119
It's something
you never forget.

796
01:11:23,134 --> 01:11:26,764
-Benjamin!
-You make me feel younger.

797
01:11:27,023 --> 01:11:30,864
You make me feel years
younger too. I wish I was.

798
01:11:32,152 --> 01:11:37,016
So many things I'd change.
I'd undo all my mistakes.

799
01:11:37,217 --> 01:11:39,697
What mistakes?

800
01:11:42,427 --> 01:11:45,353
I kept waiting, you know.

801
01:11:45,554 --> 01:11:50,634
Thinking that I'd do something
to change my circumstances.

802
01:11:50,932 --> 01:11:53,442
Do something.

803
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:58,011
Such an awful waste,
you never get it back.

804
01:11:58,212 --> 01:12:00,682
Wasted time.

805
01:12:05,735 --> 01:12:08,808
If we're going to have an affair,

806
01:12:09,009 --> 01:12:12,343
you're never to look
at me during the day.

807
01:12:12,544 --> 01:12:15,973
And we're always to
part before sunrise,

808
01:12:16,174 --> 01:12:19,774
and we will never say
"I love you".

809
01:12:20,106 --> 01:12:22,956
Those are the rules.

810
01:12:24,655 --> 01:12:28,550
Are you cold?
-I'm freezing.

811
01:13:05,907 --> 01:13:09,797
She was the first woman
that ever loved me.

812
01:13:11,614 --> 01:13:14,416
Want me to skip some?

813
01:13:14,617 --> 01:13:19,272
No, glad he had somebody
to keep him warm.

814
01:13:22,321 --> 01:13:25,761
I couldn't wait
to see her again.

815
01:13:37,726 --> 01:13:42,916
We saw each other every night.
We always used the same room.

816
01:13:44,890 --> 01:13:48,975
But each time seemed
new and different.

817
01:13:49,812 --> 01:13:52,012
Come here.

818
01:13:58,617 --> 01:14:00,657
Elizabeth...

819
01:14:01,626 --> 01:14:03,837
Good night.

820
01:14:05,562 --> 01:14:08,232
Until one night.

821
01:14:44,501 --> 01:14:51,701
<i>Yesterday, December 7th 1941,
the day which will live in infamy.</i>

822
01:14:56,224 --> 01:15:00,281
...in the near future,
and possibly beyond.

823
01:15:00,882 --> 01:15:03,924
There's been a change
of plan, lads.

824
01:15:04,125 --> 01:15:06,650
As you may or may not know,

825
01:15:06,851 --> 01:15:09,745
the Japs bombed
Pearl Harbor yesterday.

826
01:15:09,946 --> 01:15:13,621
Frank D. Roosevelt asked
each of us to do our part.

827
01:15:13,822 --> 01:15:18,077
The Chelsea's been commissioned
to serve in the United States Navy.

828
01:15:18,325 --> 01:15:22,050
To repair, salvage
and to rescue.

829
01:15:23,033 --> 01:15:27,513
Anybody doesn't wanna go to war,
now's the time to say so.

830
01:15:27,714 --> 01:15:32,514
Once you set foot on that boat,
you're in the Navy, friend.

831
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:37,877
I've been meaning to
talk with you, Mike.

832
01:15:38,078 --> 01:15:40,488
My wife's doing poorly.

833
01:15:40,689 --> 01:15:43,889
I'd like to maybe
see her one more time.

834
01:15:44,505 --> 01:15:49,705
You're free to make your way
home any way you can, Mr Mayes.

835
01:15:54,013 --> 01:15:56,031
If he's leaving,
who's gonna cook?

836
01:15:56,232 --> 01:16:00,059
Food poisoning is one of the
leading causes of death at sea.

837
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:02,460
Right after inadequate
safety equipment.

838
01:16:02,661 --> 01:16:05,556
I can cook, captain.
Been doin' it all my life.

839
01:16:05,757 --> 01:16:09,597
Yeah, I knew it. You're a little
too old for war, Benjamin.

840
01:16:09,824 --> 01:16:13,124
Ah, what the hell.
I'll take any man

841
01:16:13,325 --> 01:16:16,925
who wants to kick the shit
out of Japs and Huns.

842
01:16:17,595 --> 01:16:22,680
That's it! Back to your gear.
We're going to war, gentlemen!

843
01:16:28,405 --> 01:16:30,980
She had left a note.

844
01:16:31,364 --> 01:16:34,934
She wrote "It was nice
to have met you."

845
01:16:35,135 --> 01:16:37,735
And that was it.

846
01:16:39,868 --> 01:16:43,110
It wasn't the war
any of us expected.

847
01:16:43,311 --> 01:16:47,176
We just towed crippled ships.
Scraps of metal, really.

848
01:16:47,377 --> 01:16:51,232
If there was a war,
we didn't see it.

849
01:16:51,947 --> 01:16:56,248
There was a man assigned to us.
The Chief Gunner loved the Navy.

850
01:16:56,449 --> 01:16:58,532
But most of all,
he loved America.

851
01:16:58,733 --> 01:17:01,333
There is no other
country in the world!

852
01:17:01,534 --> 01:17:03,934
When you spell A.M.E.R.I.C.A,
you're spelling freedom.

853
01:17:04,157 --> 01:17:07,456
His name was Dennis Smith and
he was a full blooded Cherokee.

854
01:17:07,603 --> 01:17:10,603
His family had been americans
for over 500 years.

855
01:17:10,803 --> 01:17:14,469
These pacifists. They say
they won't fight on conscience.

856
01:17:14,670 --> 01:17:16,738
Where would we be...

857
01:17:16,939 --> 01:17:20,139
if everybody decided to act
according to their conscience?

858
01:17:20,339 --> 01:17:23,409
Keep it down, would you chief!

859
01:17:38,714 --> 01:17:40,314
Hey...

860
01:17:41,315 --> 01:17:45,715
I've been watching you.
You seem trustworthy.

861
01:17:46,916 --> 01:17:49,916
If something happens to me,

862
01:17:52,949 --> 01:17:56,150
could you see that
this gets to my wife?

863
01:17:56,351 --> 01:18:00,624
He had given me all of his pay.
Hadn't spent a dime of it.

864
01:18:02,143 --> 01:18:06,568
I want my family to know
that I was thinking about them.

865
01:18:10,478 --> 01:18:12,988
All hands on deck!

866
01:18:14,481 --> 01:18:17,905
Get you asses up here,
you lazy bastards!

867
01:18:38,708 --> 01:18:41,805
The war had finally found us.

868
01:18:43,353 --> 01:18:45,595
Full stop!

869
01:18:47,579 --> 01:18:50,458
Pleasant, get on that light.

870
01:18:57,804 --> 01:19:02,604
A transport carrying 1300 men
had been split by a torpedo.

871
01:19:04,050 --> 01:19:06,912
We were first to
arrive at the scene.

872
01:19:06,913 --> 01:19:10,132
Stop the engine!
Full stop!

873
01:19:15,381 --> 01:19:18,421
We were the only sound.

874
01:19:31,075 --> 01:19:32,957
Fellows!

875
01:19:48,422 --> 01:19:52,450
We surely can't count
to outrun them fuckers.

876
01:19:52,951 --> 01:19:55,441
Battle stations!

877
01:20:08,295 --> 01:20:10,095
What?

878
01:20:22,364 --> 01:20:25,329
Is that the last one?

879
01:21:45,782 --> 01:21:47,582
Captain!

880
01:22:02,863 --> 01:22:06,488
They shot the hell
out of my paintin'!

881
01:22:06,837 --> 01:22:09,497
Give me your hand.

882
01:22:13,922 --> 01:22:16,527
You'll be alright,
captain Mike.

883
01:22:16,728 --> 01:22:20,728
Nice spot in heaven's
waitin' for you. Nice spot.

884
01:22:20,929 --> 01:22:25,384
You could be mad as a mad dog
at the way things went.

885
01:22:27,005 --> 01:22:30,845
You could swear,
curse the fates...

886
01:22:32,738 --> 01:22:35,868
but when it comes to the end...

887
01:22:37,065 --> 01:22:40,065
you have to let go.

888
01:22:45,950 --> 01:22:47,769
Captain.

889
01:23:08,086 --> 01:23:11,364
1328 men died that day.

890
01:23:13,622 --> 01:23:17,514
I said my goodbyes to the
Cherokee, Dennis Smith.

891
01:23:17,715 --> 01:23:22,106
John Grimm who was right,
he was gonna die there.

892
01:23:22,407 --> 01:23:25,978
I sent Pleasant Curtis'
wife his money.

893
01:23:26,179 --> 01:23:29,466
I said goodbye to
the twin, Vic Brody,

894
01:23:29,667 --> 01:23:34,687
and to Mike Clark, captain
of the tugboat "Chelsea."

895
01:23:36,372 --> 01:23:40,671
I said goodbye to all the other men,
who had dreams of their own.

896
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:44,313
All the men who wanted to be
insurance salesmen or doctors

897
01:23:44,514 --> 01:23:47,179
or lawyers or Indian chiefs.

898
01:23:47,505 --> 01:23:50,150
This don't get fixed.

899
01:23:51,638 --> 01:23:55,618
Out here, death
didn't seem natural.

900
01:24:11,619 --> 01:24:15,866
I had never seen a hummingbird
that far out to sea.

901
01:24:16,267 --> 01:24:19,142
Before or since.

902
01:24:23,793 --> 01:24:28,265
And in may of 1945,
when I was 26 years old...

903
01:24:31,466 --> 01:24:33,466
I'm coming!

904
01:24:42,283 --> 01:24:44,853
Queenie? -Yes.

905
01:24:48,389 --> 01:24:52,277
Oh, sweet Jesus!
You're home!

906
01:24:53,561 --> 01:24:56,820
Lord, you came back!
Let me look at you!

907
01:24:57,072 --> 01:24:59,938
Who's that, mama? -Child,
it's your brother, Benjamin.

908
01:25:00,140 --> 01:25:01,897
I didn't know he
was my brother.

909
01:25:02,098 --> 01:25:04,348
There's a shit load of
things you don't know.

910
01:25:04,549 --> 01:25:07,349
Finish sweeping, wash your hands
and help me with the table. C'mon!

911
01:25:07,549 --> 01:25:10,800
Turn around. Oh, you look
like you've been born again!

912
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,316
Younger than the springtime.

913
01:25:13,517 --> 01:25:16,992
I think that preacher laid the hands
on you gave you a second life.

914
01:25:17,193 --> 01:25:20,616
I knew it the moment
I saw you, you were special.

915
01:25:20,817 --> 01:25:24,574
I tell you what, my knees are
sore cause I've been on them

916
01:25:24,775 --> 01:25:28,932
every night asking the Lord,
I say God, bring him home safely.

917
01:25:29,256 --> 01:25:31,601
Remember what I told you?

918
01:25:31,837 --> 01:25:36,452
You never know what's comin'
for you? -That's right. Sit down.

919
01:25:39,037 --> 01:25:42,728
Did you learn anything
worth repeating?

920
01:25:43,129 --> 01:25:47,804
-I sure saw some things.
-Oh, you've seen some pain.

921
01:25:48,780 --> 01:25:53,800
Some joy too? -Sure, sure I did.
-Yeah, that's what I wanna hear.

922
01:25:54,807 --> 01:25:57,805
Look at you...
-Where's Tizzy?

923
01:25:58,006 --> 01:26:00,022
Oh, baby!

924
01:26:01,697 --> 01:26:05,738
Mr Weathers died in his sleep
one night last april.

925
01:26:05,939 --> 01:26:10,349
Mama, I'm so sorry. -Don't you
worry about that, baby.

926
01:26:10,968 --> 01:26:14,028
Well, there's only one or
two of them left now.

927
01:26:14,229 --> 01:26:16,229
They're all just about new.

928
01:26:16,429 --> 01:26:19,511
I guess they're waitin' their
turn like everybody else.

929
01:26:19,712 --> 01:26:22,262
I'm so glad you're
back home with me.

930
01:26:22,463 --> 01:26:25,472
Now we're going to find you
a wife and a new job.

931
01:26:25,673 --> 01:26:28,678
Come and help me
with this table.

932
01:26:30,688 --> 01:26:33,933
Benjamin! You're wasting
your time, baby.

933
01:26:34,217 --> 01:26:36,301
She's stone deaf.

934
01:26:36,502 --> 01:26:40,102
You'll be staying in what was
Mrs DeSeroux's old room.

935
01:26:40,302 --> 01:26:44,187
You're too big to be rooming
with anybody else.

936
01:26:46,732 --> 01:26:49,962
It's a funny thing
about coming home.

937
01:26:50,287 --> 01:26:54,322
Looks the same. Smells
the same. Feels the same.

938
01:26:56,505 --> 01:27:01,600
Did I ever tell you I've been
struck by lightning 7 times?

939
01:27:01,923 --> 01:27:06,808
Once when I was sitting in my
truck, minding my own business.

940
01:27:11,212 --> 01:27:15,612
You realise
what's changed, is you.

941
01:27:17,270 --> 01:27:22,150
And late one morning,
not long after I'd been back...

942
01:27:50,660 --> 01:27:53,725
Excuse me, is Queenie here?

943
01:27:54,258 --> 01:27:56,081
Daisy?

944
01:27:58,614 --> 01:28:02,631
It's me, Benjamin.
-Benjamin?

945
01:28:06,074 --> 01:28:08,283
Oh my God!

946
01:28:09,022 --> 01:28:12,489
Of course it's you! Benjamin!

947
01:28:14,878 --> 01:28:16,679
How are you?

948
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:19,713
It's been such a long time!
There's so much I wanna know!

949
01:28:19,914 --> 01:28:22,825
When did you get back?
-I got back few weeks ago.

950
01:28:23,026 --> 01:28:25,578
I spoke to Queenie, she said
you were in the war,

951
01:28:25,779 --> 01:28:29,403
somewhere at sea, we were so
worried about you. -I'm okay.

952
01:28:30,301 --> 01:28:34,033
Well, look at you.
You are so lovely.

953
01:28:35,906 --> 01:28:38,561
You stopped writing.

954
01:28:39,830 --> 01:28:45,116
When I had left she was a girl.
And a woman had taken her place.

955
01:28:45,317 --> 01:28:48,460
She was the most beautiful
woman I've ever seen.

956
01:28:48,661 --> 01:28:50,666
Beautiful.

957
01:28:51,955 --> 01:28:54,460
The most beautiful.

958
01:28:55,702 --> 01:28:58,928
You remember grandma Fuller?
-Sure I do. -She passed.

959
01:28:59,135 --> 01:29:01,374
I heard that, I'm sorry.

960
01:29:01,575 --> 01:29:04,475
I just can't believe
we're both here.

961
01:29:04,675 --> 01:29:08,685
Must be fate... no, no,
what did he call it? Kismet.

962
01:29:08,886 --> 01:29:12,312
Do you know about Edgar Cayce,
the psychic? -I don't believe I...

963
01:29:12,513 --> 01:29:16,113
He says that everything
is predetermined, but...

964
01:29:16,314 --> 01:29:19,614
I like to think
that it is fate.

965
01:29:21,558 --> 01:29:24,924
I'm not sure how it works,
but I'm glad it happened.

966
01:29:25,125 --> 01:29:28,724
Have you been to Manhattan?
It's right across the river from me.

967
01:29:28,925 --> 01:29:32,526
I can see the Empire State
Building if I stand on my bed.

968
01:29:32,727 --> 01:29:35,753
What about you, where've
you been? Tell me everything.

969
01:29:35,954 --> 01:29:39,002
Last time you wrote, you said
you've been to Russia.

970
01:29:39,203 --> 01:29:42,820
I always wanted to go to Russia.
Is it as cold as they say?

971
01:29:43,021 --> 01:29:46,026
-Twice as cold.
-My goodness!

972
01:29:46,374 --> 01:29:51,574
We always said you were different.
I think you really are.

973
01:29:52,913 --> 01:29:56,878
You wrote that you met
somebody. Did it work out?

974
01:29:57,079 --> 01:29:59,629
It ran its course.

975
01:30:00,053 --> 01:30:03,091
Hey, do you remember this?

976
01:30:13,016 --> 01:30:18,416
This is the picture of Old Man
Kangaroo at 5 in the afternoon.

977
01:30:19,775 --> 01:30:22,930
Would you like to have dinner?

978
01:30:29,613 --> 01:30:33,044
Did I tell you that I danced
for Ballenchine?

979
01:30:33,245 --> 01:30:38,245
He's a famous choreographer.
He said that I had perfect line.

980
01:30:39,438 --> 01:30:43,526
In a rehearsal once,
a dancer fell.

981
01:30:43,793 --> 01:30:46,513
And he just put it
right into the production.

982
01:30:46,814 --> 01:30:50,264
Can you imagine that
in a classical ballet?

983
01:30:50,465 --> 01:30:53,655
A dancer intentionally falling?

984
01:30:53,856 --> 01:30:57,670
There's a whole new word for
dance now, it's called abstract.

985
01:30:57,871 --> 01:31:01,671
He's not the only one though,
there's Lincoln Kirstein,

986
01:31:01,830 --> 01:31:05,234
and Lucia Chase
and Agnes DeMille...

987
01:31:05,435 --> 01:31:08,874
she has just torn up
all those conventions,

988
01:31:09,075 --> 01:31:12,346
all that straight up
and down stuff...

989
01:31:13,147 --> 01:31:15,833
And she told me about
this big new world.

990
01:31:16,034 --> 01:31:18,484
Names that didn't
mean a thing to me.

991
01:31:18,685 --> 01:31:21,522
I didn't really hear very much
of what she was saying.

992
01:31:21,723 --> 01:31:23,986
It's new and modern
and it's American.

993
01:31:24,187 --> 01:31:26,487
They understand our vigor
and our physicality.

994
01:31:26,687 --> 01:31:29,043
Oh my God, I've just been
talking and talking.

995
01:31:29,244 --> 01:31:31,444
No, no, I've enjoyed listening.

996
01:31:31,644 --> 01:31:35,469
I didn't know you smoked.
-I'm old enough.

997
01:31:38,025 --> 01:31:41,675
I'm old enough
for a lot of things.

998
01:31:43,724 --> 01:31:46,824
In New York we stay up all night.

999
01:31:47,125 --> 01:31:50,595
Watch the sun come up
over the warehouses.

1000
01:31:52,387 --> 01:31:55,457
There's always something to do.

1001
01:32:12,512 --> 01:32:15,495
I have to go back tomorrow.

1002
01:32:15,696 --> 01:32:18,936
-So soon?
-Wish I could stay.

1003
01:32:22,489 --> 01:32:26,029
Dancers don't need costumes
or scenery anymore.

1004
01:32:26,230 --> 01:32:29,820
I can imagine dancing
completely naked.

1005
01:32:30,667 --> 01:32:34,914
Have you read D.H. Lawrence?
His books were banned.

1006
01:32:35,215 --> 01:32:38,881
The words are like making love.

1007
01:33:23,628 --> 01:33:28,513
In our company,
we have to trust each other.

1008
01:33:33,433 --> 01:33:37,116
Sex is a part of it.

1009
01:33:41,403 --> 01:33:44,823
I know a lot of the dancers
are lesbians.

1010
01:33:46,468 --> 01:33:50,308
There was one woman who
wanted to sleep with me.

1011
01:33:56,877 --> 01:34:00,532
Was that upseting you?
-Which part?

1012
01:34:00,810 --> 01:34:04,868
Somebody wanted to sleep with me?
-You're a desirable woman,

1013
01:34:05,069 --> 01:34:08,767
I would think most of them
would wanna sleep with you.

1014
01:34:08,968 --> 01:34:11,968
Let's go back to the house.

1015
01:34:12,769 --> 01:34:15,869
Or we can get a room somewhere.

1016
01:34:17,401 --> 01:34:20,985
We can lay down your jacket.
-I don't know, Daisy...

1017
01:34:21,186 --> 01:34:26,112
It's not that I wouldn't like to.
I think I'd just disappoint you.

1018
01:34:27,067 --> 01:34:30,612
Benjamin, I've been
with older men.

1019
01:34:30,862 --> 01:34:33,481
You go back to New York
in the morning,

1020
01:34:33,682 --> 01:34:36,082
you should be with your friends.

1021
01:34:36,282 --> 01:34:38,816
You're only young once.
-Oh, I'm old enough.

1022
01:34:39,017 --> 01:34:42,442
Daisy, just not tonight, is all.

1023
01:34:55,119 --> 01:34:58,549
We can go hear some music.

1024
01:34:59,502 --> 01:35:02,903
Our lives are defined
by opportunities.

1025
01:35:03,104 --> 01:35:05,644
Even the ones we miss.

1026
01:35:05,886 --> 01:35:09,284
You look so handsome,
so distinct.

1027
01:35:09,485 --> 01:35:12,365
They're sayin' the hurricane is
gonna miss us. Blow right on by.

1028
01:35:12,566 --> 01:35:15,766
-Oh, that's great.
-I'll stay under the blankets...

1029
01:35:16,039 --> 01:35:19,039
with mother.
She said nothing...

1030
01:35:19,484 --> 01:35:21,354
Benjamin?

1031
01:35:22,493 --> 01:35:25,168
Things were becoming
different for me.

1032
01:35:25,369 --> 01:35:28,607
My hair had very little gray
and grew like weeds.

1033
01:35:28,808 --> 01:35:32,423
My sense of smell was keener,
my hearing more acute.

1034
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:35,621
I could walk further and faster.

1035
01:35:35,822 --> 01:35:41,052
While everybody else was aging,
I was getting younger. All alone.

1036
01:35:44,055 --> 01:35:46,051
Come in.

1037
01:35:46,666 --> 01:35:48,489
Benjamin!

1038
01:35:49,083 --> 01:35:52,505
Do you remember me?
-Sure I do, Mr Button.

1039
01:35:52,806 --> 01:35:56,821
What happened to you?
-Darn foot got infected.

1040
01:35:58,022 --> 01:36:00,912
Welcome home, my friend.

1041
01:36:01,898 --> 01:36:04,931
I see you're still drinking
your Sazerac with whiskey.

1042
01:36:05,132 --> 01:36:06,932
I'm a creature of habit.

1043
01:36:07,132 --> 01:36:09,169
Still visiting the house
on Bourbon Street?

1044
01:36:09,370 --> 01:36:11,570
Not for a long time.

1045
01:36:12,070 --> 01:36:14,364
Interesting times, though.

1046
01:36:14,565 --> 01:36:18,830
We went from making 40 thousand
to nearly a million buttons a day.

1047
01:36:19,031 --> 01:36:21,431
We employed ten times
the number of people.

1048
01:36:21,632 --> 01:36:24,032
We were operating
around the clock.

1049
01:36:28,097 --> 01:36:30,191
Damn shame.

1050
01:36:30,553 --> 01:36:34,143
The war has been kind
to the button industry.

1051
01:36:36,226 --> 01:36:38,233
You know...

1052
01:36:39,755 --> 01:36:43,423
I'm sick. I don't know
how much longer I have.

1053
01:36:43,624 --> 01:36:47,276
I'm sorry to hear that,
Mr Button. -No...

1054
01:36:47,477 --> 01:36:51,537
I don't have any people.
I keep to myself.

1055
01:36:52,970 --> 01:36:55,347
I hope you don't mind, but...

1056
01:36:55,548 --> 01:36:58,148
whenever possible,
I'd enjoy your company.

1057
01:36:58,348 --> 01:37:01,173
I'll certainly do what I can.

1058
01:37:04,222 --> 01:37:08,287
Benjamin, do you know
anything about buttons?

1059
01:37:10,723 --> 01:37:15,396
Button's Buttons has been
in our family for 124 years.

1060
01:37:15,897 --> 01:37:20,340
My grandfather was a tailor.
He had a small shop in Richmond.

1061
01:37:20,541 --> 01:37:23,717
After the Civil War,
He moved to New Orleans

1062
01:37:23,918 --> 01:37:28,157
where my father had the wisdom
to make our own buttons.

1063
01:37:28,358 --> 01:37:33,369
So, with his help,
the tailor shop grew to this.

1064
01:37:33,938 --> 01:37:37,333
And today, I can't sew a stitch.

1065
01:37:40,809 --> 01:37:43,794
That's very, very interesting.

1066
01:37:46,636 --> 01:37:50,181
You sure have done
well for yourself.

1067
01:37:50,561 --> 01:37:54,795
So... what can I do
for you, Mr Button?

1068
01:37:56,597 --> 01:38:00,263
Benjamin, you are my son.

1069
01:38:07,340 --> 01:38:11,177
I'm so sorry I've never
told you before.

1070
01:38:12,078 --> 01:38:15,993
You were born the night
the Great war ended.

1071
01:38:17,371 --> 01:38:21,086
Your mother died
giving birth to you.

1072
01:38:22,349 --> 01:38:25,354
I thought you were a monster.

1073
01:38:28,172 --> 01:38:33,012
I promised your mother
I'd make sure you were safe.

1074
01:38:38,053 --> 01:38:41,308
I should never have
abandoned you.

1075
01:38:44,383 --> 01:38:46,391
My mother?

1076
01:38:47,176 --> 01:38:50,202
This is our summer house
on Lake Pontchartrain.

1077
01:38:50,403 --> 01:38:53,920
When I was a boy I loved to
wake up before anyone else,

1078
01:38:54,121 --> 01:38:57,926
run down to the lake
and watch the day begin.

1079
01:38:58,427 --> 01:39:02,032
It was as if I was
the only one alive.

1080
01:39:02,833 --> 01:39:05,988
I fell in love the
first time I saw her.

1081
01:39:06,189 --> 01:39:09,440
Your mother's name was
Caroline Murphy.

1082
01:39:09,641 --> 01:39:13,466
She worked in your
grandfather's kitchen.

1083
01:39:15,533 --> 01:39:17,798
She was from Dublin.

1084
01:39:17,993 --> 01:39:21,601
In 1903, Caroline and all
her brothers and sisters

1085
01:39:21,802 --> 01:39:25,167
came to live here,
in New Orleans.

1086
01:39:26,163 --> 01:39:29,763
I'd find excuses to go
down to that kitchen,

1087
01:39:29,964 --> 01:39:32,964
just so I could look at her.

1088
01:39:38,404 --> 01:39:42,635
April 25th 1918, the
happiest day of my life.

1089
01:39:42,836 --> 01:39:45,836
The day I married your mother.

1090
01:39:46,699 --> 01:39:49,599
Why didn't you just tell me?

1091
01:39:49,908 --> 01:39:53,931
I plan on leaving
everything I have to you.

1092
01:39:54,132 --> 01:39:56,189
I have to go.

1093
01:39:56,406 --> 01:39:59,400
-Where?
-Home.

1094
01:39:59,928 --> 01:40:02,269
What is he thinking?
He think he can just show up

1095
01:40:02,470 --> 01:40:04,731
and everything's supposed
to be fine and dandy.

1096
01:40:04,932 --> 01:40:07,063
Everybody's supposed
to be friends.

1097
01:40:07,264 --> 01:40:10,064
He got another thing coming,
that's for sure.

1098
01:40:10,265 --> 01:40:13,165
God be my witness,
he got another thing coming!

1099
01:40:13,480 --> 01:40:16,694
He left us 18 dollars
that night you was found.

1100
01:40:16,895 --> 01:40:20,066
18 ratty dollars
and a filthy diaper!

1101
01:40:20,267 --> 01:40:23,892
-Good night, Mom.
-Good night, baby.

1102
01:40:36,570 --> 01:40:41,370
Did I ever tell you, I was
struck by lightning 7 times?

1103
01:40:42,545 --> 01:40:45,960
Once I was walking
the dog down the road.

1104
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:53,698
I'm blind in the one eye,
can't hardly hear.

1105
01:40:54,699 --> 01:40:57,599
I get twitches and shakes
out of nowhere,

1106
01:40:57,800 --> 01:41:00,700
I always lose my line of thought.

1107
01:41:00,951 --> 01:41:03,311
But you know what?

1108
01:41:03,566 --> 01:41:07,366
God keeps reminding me
I'm lucky to be alive.

1109
01:41:11,999 --> 01:41:14,399
Storm's comin'.

1110
01:42:00,575 --> 01:42:02,637
Wake up.

1111
01:42:04,669 --> 01:42:07,519
Let's get you dressed.

1112
01:43:40,339 --> 01:43:44,206
You could be mad as a mad dog
at the way things went.

1113
01:43:44,407 --> 01:43:48,016
You can swear and
curse the fates...

1114
01:43:48,317 --> 01:43:51,409
but when it comes to the end...

1115
01:43:51,710 --> 01:43:54,305
you have to let go.

1116
01:44:15,784 --> 01:44:18,963
That sure is a beautiful service.

1117
01:44:19,988 --> 01:44:23,628
He'll be burried right
next to your mother.

1118
01:44:24,215 --> 01:44:27,215
You're my mother.

1119
01:44:29,616 --> 01:44:31,816
My baby.

1120
01:44:35,818 --> 01:44:38,818
I've never seen New York.

1121
01:46:06,096 --> 01:46:09,981
Excuse me, I'm a friend of
Daisy's. -Right this way.

1122
01:46:12,956 --> 01:46:14,967
Daisy!

1123
01:46:15,368 --> 01:46:17,668
Yes! I'm in the wardrobe!

1124
01:46:17,828 --> 01:46:20,598
Is somebody looking for me?

1125
01:46:21,937 --> 01:46:24,497
Benjamin! -Hi.

1126
01:46:25,418 --> 01:46:29,237
-What are you doing here?
-I thought I'd come visit.

1127
01:46:29,438 --> 01:46:32,798
Spend some time
with you if I could.

1128
01:46:34,474 --> 01:46:38,874
I wish you would have called.
You took me by surprise.

1129
01:46:40,104 --> 01:46:44,535
-Are you still mad?
-No. Thank you, they're lovely.

1130
01:46:44,836 --> 01:46:47,856
I couldn't take
my eyes off of you.

1131
01:46:48,057 --> 01:46:51,057
I thought you were mesmerizing.

1132
01:46:51,645 --> 01:46:55,202
Thank you. That's very
kind of you to say.

1133
01:46:59,625 --> 01:47:01,870
I better get changed. A group
of us are going to a party.

1134
01:47:02,071 --> 01:47:03,936
Would you wanna come?

1135
01:47:04,137 --> 01:47:06,647
Somebody told me about a restaurant
I thought you might enjoy.

1136
01:47:06,848 --> 01:47:09,269
I made a reservation.
Just in case.

1137
01:47:09,470 --> 01:47:12,676
It's just that all the dancers
go out after the show.

1138
01:47:12,877 --> 01:47:16,888
You're welcome to come with us.
I'll get changed, alright?

1139
01:47:36,966 --> 01:47:40,644
This is David.
He dances with the company.

1140
01:47:40,845 --> 01:47:44,076
This is Benjamin.
I told you about him.

1141
01:47:44,280 --> 01:47:46,530
Oh yeah... how are you doing?

1142
01:47:46,731 --> 01:47:49,711
I'll go get you a drink.

1143
01:47:57,355 --> 01:48:00,755
So, you were a friend
of her grandmother's?

1144
01:48:00,956 --> 01:48:03,556
Or something like that?

1145
01:48:03,906 --> 01:48:07,106
-Something like that.
-Excuse me.

1146
01:48:52,409 --> 01:48:54,009
Hey!

1147
01:48:54,210 --> 01:48:57,240
I had no idea you were coming!

1148
01:48:57,729 --> 01:49:00,132
Lord, Benjamin...

1149
01:49:01,914 --> 01:49:04,123
What did you expect?

1150
01:49:04,324 --> 01:49:08,214
What, you want me to drop
everything? This is my life.

1151
01:49:08,415 --> 01:49:11,182
Hey, going downtown?

1152
01:49:15,357 --> 01:49:17,216
Come on.

1153
01:49:17,425 --> 01:49:21,268
Have a good time. There'll be
musicians, interesting people...

1154
01:49:21,480 --> 01:49:24,880
You don't have to do that.
It's my fault.

1155
01:49:25,081 --> 01:49:27,881
I should've called.
I thought...

1156
01:49:28,082 --> 01:49:32,557
I'll come here and sweep you
off your feet, or something.

1157
01:49:33,812 --> 01:49:37,970
-Daisy, come on!
-I'll be right there.

1158
01:49:40,168 --> 01:49:44,010
He seems nice.
Do you love him?

1159
01:49:47,406 --> 01:49:49,678
I think so.

1160
01:49:50,796 --> 01:49:53,401
I'm happy for you.

1161
01:49:54,605 --> 01:49:57,600
Maybe I'll see you at home.

1162
01:49:59,230 --> 01:50:01,072
Okay.

1163
01:50:02,487 --> 01:50:05,152
I enjoyed the show!

1164
01:50:11,898 --> 01:50:16,498
He came to tell me
his father had died.

1165
01:50:17,665 --> 01:50:20,055
You couldn't have known.

1166
01:50:20,256 --> 01:50:24,105
I was 23. I just didn't care.

1167
01:50:26,601 --> 01:50:31,424
What did you do next?
-Some photographs, I think.

1168
01:50:31,725 --> 01:50:34,785
Front of my bag.

1169
01:50:37,153 --> 01:50:41,381
I was as good a dancer
as I was ever gonna be.

1170
01:50:42,858 --> 01:50:45,756
For five years...

1171
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:50,363
I danced everywhere.

1172
01:50:50,998 --> 01:50:54,599
London, Vienna, Prague...

1173
01:50:54,900 --> 01:50:57,840
I've never seen these.

1174
01:51:00,305 --> 01:51:04,783
Mom, you never talked
about your dancing.

1175
01:51:05,435 --> 01:51:09,235
I was the only American
to be invited

1176
01:51:09,436 --> 01:51:12,436
to dance with the Bolshoi.

1177
01:51:14,271 --> 01:51:17,060
It was glorious.

1178
01:51:20,922 --> 01:51:25,340
But Benjamin was never
far from my thoughts.

1179
01:51:27,700 --> 01:51:31,088
And I'd find myself saying:

1180
01:51:31,557 --> 01:51:34,343
Goodnight, Benjamin.

1181
01:51:35,173 --> 01:51:39,228
-"Goodnight, Daisy."
-He said that?

1182
01:51:41,031 --> 01:51:43,822
Life wasn't all that complicated.

1183
01:51:44,023 --> 01:51:48,423
If you want, you might say
I was looking for something.

1184
01:51:55,291 --> 01:51:58,971
Benjamin, mrs La Tourneau
just passed.

1185
01:52:05,661 --> 01:52:09,306
Mr Benjamin Button?
-That would be me.

1186
01:52:36,569 --> 01:52:38,788
Bonjour.
-Oui, monsieur?

1187
01:52:38,989 --> 01:52:41,554
Miss Daisy Fuller.
-Just a minute.

1188
01:52:41,755 --> 01:52:44,765
Please, have a seat.
-Sure.

1189
01:52:51,199 --> 01:52:55,958
Sometimes we are on a collision
course and we just don't know it.

1190
01:52:56,159 --> 01:52:59,159
Whether it's by accident
or by design,

1191
01:52:59,360 --> 01:53:02,360
there's not a thing
we can do about it.

1192
01:53:03,418 --> 01:53:07,238
A woman in Paris was on
her way to go shopping.

1193
01:53:07,794 --> 01:53:11,612
But she had forgotten her coat,
and went back to get it.

1194
01:53:11,813 --> 01:53:14,700
When she had gotten her
coat the phone had rung,

1195
01:53:14,901 --> 01:53:18,557
so she had stopped to answer it
and talked for a couple of minutes.

1196
01:53:18,758 --> 01:53:20,758
While the woman was
on the phone,

1197
01:53:20,959 --> 01:53:24,459
Daisy was rehearsing for performance
at the Paris Opera House.

1198
01:53:24,632 --> 01:53:27,664
And while she was rehearsing,
the woman, off the phone now,

1199
01:53:27,865 --> 01:53:30,670
had gone outside to get a taxi.

1200
01:53:34,409 --> 01:53:37,261
Now a taxi driver had
dropped off a fare earlier,

1201
01:53:37,462 --> 01:53:40,473
and had stopped to
get a cup of coffee.

1202
01:53:40,674 --> 01:53:44,169
And all the while
Daisy was rehearsing.

1203
01:53:46,518 --> 01:53:48,971
And this cab driver who had
dropped off the earlier fare,

1204
01:53:49,172 --> 01:53:51,219
and had stopped to
get the cup of coffee,

1205
01:53:51,420 --> 01:53:53,620
had picked up the lady
who was going shopping,

1206
01:53:53,820 --> 01:53:56,555
who had missed
getting the earlier cab.

1207
01:53:56,775 --> 01:53:59,209
Taxi had to stop for a man
crossing the street,

1208
01:53:59,410 --> 01:54:02,229
who had left for work 5 minutes
later than he normally did,

1209
01:54:02,430 --> 01:54:05,281
because he forgot
to set his alarm.

1210
01:54:05,482 --> 01:54:08,744
While the man, late for work,
was crossing the street,

1211
01:54:08,945 --> 01:54:12,545
Daisy had finished rehearsing
and was taking a shower.

1212
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:15,632
While Daisy was showering, taxi
was waiting outside a Boutique

1213
01:54:15,833 --> 01:54:19,152
for the woman to pick up a package
which hadn't been wrapped yet

1214
01:54:19,329 --> 01:54:21,929
because the girl who
was supposed to wrap it

1215
01:54:22,129 --> 01:54:25,435
had broken up with her boyfriend
the night before, and forgot.

1216
01:54:25,636 --> 01:54:28,473
When the package was wrapped,
the woman, who was back in the cab,

1217
01:54:28,674 --> 01:54:30,711
was blocked by a delivery truck.

1218
01:54:30,912 --> 01:54:33,752
All the while Daisy
was getting dressed.

1219
01:54:34,585 --> 01:54:37,825
The delivery truck pulled away
and the taxi was able to move.

1220
01:54:38,026 --> 01:54:40,475
While Daisy,
the last to be dressed,

1221
01:54:40,676 --> 01:54:44,120
waited for one of her friends
who had broken a shoelace.

1222
01:54:44,321 --> 01:54:47,348
While the taxi was stopped,
waiting for a traffic light,

1223
01:54:47,549 --> 01:54:51,245
Daisy and her friend came out
the back of the theater.

1224
01:54:51,446 --> 01:54:54,566
And if only one thing
had happened differently,

1225
01:54:54,767 --> 01:54:56,826
if that shoelace hadn't broken,

1226
01:54:57,027 --> 01:54:59,390
or that delivery truck had
moved moments earlier,

1227
01:54:59,591 --> 01:55:01,785
or that package had been
wrapped and ready,

1228
01:55:01,986 --> 01:55:04,476
because the girl hadn't
broken up with her boyfriend,

1229
01:55:04,677 --> 01:55:07,684
or that man had set his alarm
and got up five minutes earlier,

1230
01:55:08,152 --> 01:55:11,168
or that taxi driver hadn't
stopped for a cup of coffee,

1231
01:55:11,369 --> 01:55:13,409
or that woman had
remembered her coat

1232
01:55:13,610 --> 01:55:15,610
and had gotten
into an earlier cab,

1233
01:55:15,910 --> 01:55:18,910
Daisy and her friend would
have crossed the street.

1234
01:55:19,111 --> 01:55:21,911
And the taxi would
have driven by.

1235
01:55:32,153 --> 01:55:34,392
But life being what it is,

1236
01:55:34,593 --> 01:55:37,506
a series of intersecting
lives and incidents,

1237
01:55:37,707 --> 01:55:39,713
out of anyone's control,

1238
01:55:39,914 --> 01:55:42,314
that taxi did not go by,

1239
01:55:42,614 --> 01:55:46,238
and that driver was
momentarily distracted.

1240
01:55:47,856 --> 01:55:51,513
And that taxi hit Daisy.
-Daisy! Help!

1241
01:55:53,935 --> 01:55:56,920
And her leg was crushed.

1242
01:56:03,290 --> 01:56:05,149
Daisy...

1243
01:56:08,886 --> 01:56:12,309
-Who told you?
-Your friend wired me.

1244
01:56:12,510 --> 01:56:17,510
Very kind of you to come all this
way to see that I was alright.

1245
01:56:18,077 --> 01:56:20,842
You'd do the same for me.

1246
01:56:21,858 --> 01:56:23,854
My God!

1247
01:56:25,332 --> 01:56:29,195
Look at you.
You're perfect.

1248
01:56:31,604 --> 01:56:34,254
I wish you hadn't come.

1249
01:56:34,952 --> 01:56:38,382
I don't want you
to see me like this.

1250
01:56:42,531 --> 01:56:45,347
Her leg had been
broken in five places.

1251
01:56:45,548 --> 01:56:49,392
And with therapy, and time,
she might walk again.

1252
01:56:49,593 --> 01:56:52,413
But she'll never dance.

1253
01:56:53,183 --> 01:56:56,503
I'm gonna take you home with
me. I wanna look after you.

1254
01:56:56,704 --> 01:56:58,931
I'm not going back
to New Orleans.

1255
01:56:59,132 --> 01:57:01,440
Then I'll stay here in Paris.

1256
01:57:01,641 --> 01:57:05,187
Don't you understand?
I don't want your help.

1257
01:57:05,388 --> 01:57:07,675
I know I'm feeling
sorry for myself,

1258
01:57:07,876 --> 01:57:10,076
but I don't want to be with you.

1259
01:57:10,276 --> 01:57:14,498
I tried to tell you that in
New York, but you don't listen.

1260
01:57:14,999 --> 01:57:17,199
You might change your mind.

1261
01:57:17,400 --> 01:57:21,000
We are not little children
anymore, Benjamin.

1262
01:57:23,853 --> 01:57:26,608
Stay out of my life.

1263
01:57:48,404 --> 01:57:51,404
I was awfully cruel.

1264
01:57:52,505 --> 01:57:55,505
He didn't understand that...

1265
01:57:55,706 --> 01:57:59,106
I couldn't have him
see me like that.

1266
01:58:00,817 --> 01:58:03,832
I didn't leave right away.

1267
01:58:04,591 --> 01:58:08,876
I stayed in Paris for awhile
to look out for her.

1268
01:58:11,657 --> 01:58:14,517
I never knew that.

1269
01:58:17,121 --> 01:58:21,159
Darling, could you
get the nurse?

1270
01:58:26,460 --> 01:58:30,699
I taught myself to walk again.

1271
01:58:32,748 --> 01:58:36,188
I took the train to Lourdes.

1272
01:58:36,997 --> 01:58:40,727
Lets take a look.
That's normal.

1273
01:58:40,940 --> 01:58:44,364
Pulse rate is slowing. She is
gonna struggle to breathe.

1274
01:58:44,565 --> 01:58:47,295
Will you be alright?
-Yeah.

1275
01:58:59,725 --> 01:59:02,746
Alright, he says:
"I went back home..."

1276
01:59:02,947 --> 01:59:06,147
And then there's
lot of pages torn out.

1277
01:59:06,347 --> 01:59:10,347
"I listened to the sound of the
house." I think I've read that.

1278
01:59:12,700 --> 01:59:16,627
He spilled something on it,
so it's hard to read, mom.

1279
01:59:16,828 --> 01:59:20,034
Something about "sailing".
Does that make sense?

1280
01:59:20,235 --> 01:59:25,835
I learned to sail on an old boat of
my father's from the Lake House.

1281
01:59:33,301 --> 01:59:38,181
I can't lie, I did enjoy the
company of a woman or two.

1282
01:59:46,318 --> 01:59:49,188
Or maybe three.

1283
02:00:24,418 --> 02:00:29,218
Don't bother, Sam. It's just
gonna be there again tomorrow.

1284
02:00:32,894 --> 02:00:34,748
Mama.

1285
02:00:39,084 --> 02:00:42,094
And in the spring of 1962,

1286
02:00:45,424 --> 02:00:47,987
she came back.

1287
02:01:06,277 --> 02:01:10,107
You wanna know
where I've been? -No.

1288
02:01:11,877 --> 02:01:14,679
How come you didn't
write or nothin'?

1289
02:01:14,880 --> 02:01:16,880
Just disappearing like that.

1290
02:01:17,080 --> 02:01:19,880
It was something I needed
to do for myself.

1291
02:01:20,081 --> 02:01:23,281
I never took you to
be the selfish type.

1292
02:01:23,427 --> 02:01:26,452
I sure hope I'm not wrong.

1293
02:01:27,067 --> 02:01:29,547
I'm usually not wrong
about people.

1294
02:01:29,748 --> 02:01:32,550
-Good night, Momma.
-Good night, baby.

1295
02:01:32,751 --> 02:01:34,931
Now have fun.

1296
02:01:37,045 --> 02:01:41,845
You haven't said two words.
-I don't wanna ruin it.

1297
02:02:11,661 --> 02:02:14,856
Sleep with me. -Absolutely.

1298
02:02:51,716 --> 02:02:55,076
I asked her to come
away with me.

1299
02:02:56,272 --> 02:03:00,717
We sailed into the Gulf,
along the Florida Keys.

1300
02:03:40,820 --> 02:03:45,187
I'm so glad we didn't find
one another when I was 26.

1301
02:03:45,388 --> 02:03:49,250
-Why do you say that?
-I was so young.

1302
02:03:49,530 --> 02:03:51,911
And you were so old.

1303
02:03:52,192 --> 02:03:55,030
It happened when it was
supposed to happen.

1304
02:03:55,231 --> 02:03:59,296
I will enjoy each and every
moment I have with you.

1305
02:04:03,672 --> 02:04:08,544
I bet I can stay out here longer
than you. -Bet you can't.

1306
02:04:10,703 --> 02:04:13,519
You barely have
a line, a crease.

1307
02:04:13,720 --> 02:04:17,320
Every day I have
more wrinkles. Not fair.

1308
02:04:18,338 --> 02:04:22,363
I love your wrinkles.
Both of them.

1309
02:04:27,636 --> 02:04:31,266
What's it like,
growing younger?

1310
02:04:32,290 --> 02:04:37,277
Can't really say. I'm always
looking out of my own eyes.

1311
02:04:42,109 --> 02:04:45,974
Will you still love me when
my skin grows old and saggy?

1312
02:04:46,175 --> 02:04:49,403
Will you still love me
when I have acne?

1313
02:04:49,604 --> 02:04:51,804
When I wet the bed?

1314
02:04:51,967 --> 02:04:56,007
When I'm afraid of
what's under the stairs?

1315
02:05:02,008 --> 02:05:03,608
What?

1316
02:05:09,149 --> 02:05:13,344
What are you thinking?
-I was thinking how nothing lasts.

1317
02:05:15,475 --> 02:05:18,665
And what a shame that is.

1318
02:05:20,531 --> 02:05:23,046
Some things last.

1319
02:05:24,677 --> 02:05:29,157
-Goodnight, Daisy.
-Goodnight, Benjamin.

1320
02:05:45,072 --> 02:05:46,750
Mom?

1321
02:05:48,395 --> 02:05:53,010
When did you meet dad?
-Some time after that.

1322
02:05:55,656 --> 02:05:58,326
Did you tell him
about this Benjamin?

1323
02:05:58,527 --> 02:06:01,327
He knew enough, darling.

1324
02:06:20,392 --> 02:06:22,037
Momma!

1325
02:06:28,624 --> 02:06:30,273
Queenie!

1326
02:06:33,089 --> 02:06:34,720
Hallo?

1327
02:06:35,106 --> 02:06:38,877
Hi, Mrs Carter. It's Benjamin.
Where is everybody?

1328
02:06:39,078 --> 02:06:42,156
Oh, Benjamin. Queenie died.

1329
02:06:42,626 --> 02:06:45,024
I'm so sorry.

1330
02:07:12,556 --> 02:07:16,521
So sorry for your loss.
She was a great woman.

1331
02:07:22,954 --> 02:07:27,194
We buried her beside
her beloved Mr Weathers.

1332
02:07:32,943 --> 02:07:36,157
And so we might have
memories of our own,

1333
02:07:36,358 --> 02:07:38,958
we sold my father's
house on Esplanade.

1334
02:07:39,158 --> 02:07:41,763
It's a wonderful
old place, darlin'.

1335
02:07:41,941 --> 02:07:45,006
I think we're going
to be so happy here.

1336
02:07:45,220 --> 02:07:47,884
Oh, what a long family
history you have.

1337
02:07:48,085 --> 02:07:50,885
They come with the house.

1338
02:07:53,435 --> 02:07:56,475
We have to see the master suite.

1339
02:07:56,910 --> 02:07:59,830
We bought ourselves a duplex.

1340
02:08:01,139 --> 02:08:03,809
I loved that house.

1341
02:08:05,518 --> 02:08:08,477
It smelled like firewood.

1342
02:08:08,660 --> 02:08:11,913
Don't stop, darlin'.

1343
02:08:12,547 --> 02:08:15,410
It was one of the happiest
times of my life.

1344
02:08:15,611 --> 02:08:18,417
We didn't have
a stick of furniture.

1345
02:08:18,753 --> 02:08:22,333
We would have picnics
in the living room.

1346
02:08:24,829 --> 02:08:27,294
We ate when we felt like it.

1347
02:08:27,495 --> 02:08:29,995
Stayed up all night
when we wanted.

1348
02:08:30,195 --> 02:08:32,615
We vowed never
to fall into routine,

1349
02:08:32,816 --> 02:08:35,377
to go to bed or wake up
at the same time.

1350
02:08:35,578 --> 02:08:38,438
We lived on that mattress.

1351
02:09:13,299 --> 02:09:17,367
Our neighbor, Mrs Van Dam,
was a physical therapist.

1352
02:09:18,168 --> 02:09:22,218
We lived four blocks
from a public pool.

1353
02:09:59,511 --> 02:10:02,949
You might have got a few
more years out of it.

1354
02:10:03,150 --> 02:10:07,362
You chose to do something
so special, unique,

1355
02:10:07,863 --> 02:10:12,949
that there was only a short
window of time you could do it.

1356
02:10:13,450 --> 02:10:16,187
So even if nothing ever happened,

1357
02:10:16,388 --> 02:10:19,393
you'd still be right here
where you're now.

1358
02:10:19,594 --> 02:10:22,499
I just don't like getting old.

1359
02:10:23,054 --> 02:10:26,704
They put too much
chlorine in here.

1360
02:11:06,765 --> 02:11:11,735
I promise you, I'll never lose
myself to self-pity again.

1361
02:11:14,992 --> 02:11:19,815
And I think right there
and then, she realised...

1362
02:11:20,316 --> 02:11:23,396
None of us is perfect forever.

1363
02:11:26,024 --> 02:11:28,938
She found her own peace.

1364
02:11:29,661 --> 02:11:33,946
She opened a studio and taught
young girls how to dance.

1365
02:11:34,647 --> 02:11:37,966
Come back the other way.

1366
02:11:40,025 --> 02:11:41,914
Excellent!

1367
02:11:43,695 --> 02:11:45,713
Good night!

1368
02:12:10,421 --> 02:12:13,716
You certainly are
beautiful to watch.

1369
02:12:14,951 --> 02:12:18,016
Dance is all about the line.

1370
02:12:19,565 --> 02:12:22,138
Line of your body.

1371
02:12:22,906 --> 02:12:27,927
Sooner or later you lose that line,
and you never get it back.

1372
02:12:33,144 --> 02:12:34,948
I figure...

1373
02:12:35,149 --> 02:12:38,944
You were born in 1918,
49 years ago.

1374
02:12:39,347 --> 02:12:41,547
I am 43.

1375
02:12:42,748 --> 02:12:45,748
We are almost the same age.

1376
02:12:48,245 --> 02:12:51,015
We're meeting in the middle.

1377
02:12:51,200 --> 02:12:54,616
We finally caught up
with each other.

1378
02:12:54,816 --> 02:12:59,636
Wait. I want to remember
us just as we are now.

1379
02:13:10,034 --> 02:13:12,893
I am pregnant.

1380
02:13:29,246 --> 02:13:34,241
You know, I swear the nurse
slipped and said it was a boy.

1381
02:13:47,902 --> 02:13:50,782
But I think it's a girl.

1382
02:13:55,172 --> 02:13:57,532
I know you're afraid.

1383
02:13:57,775 --> 02:14:00,620
I'm not hiding it. -Okay.

1384
02:14:06,965 --> 02:14:10,193
-What's your worst fear?
-Baby born like me.

1385
02:14:10,394 --> 02:14:13,242
Then I will love it
all the more.

1386
02:14:14,237 --> 02:14:15,807
Okay.

1387
02:14:16,008 --> 02:14:20,008
How can I be a father when
I'm heading the other direction?

1388
02:14:20,208 --> 02:14:24,044
It's not fair to a child. I don't
wanna be anybody's burden.

1389
02:14:24,245 --> 02:14:27,285
Sugar, we all end up in diapers.

1390
02:14:27,729 --> 02:14:30,674
I'm gonna make this work.

1391
02:14:32,399 --> 02:14:35,492
I want this,
and I want it with you.

1392
02:14:35,693 --> 02:14:38,929
I want you to have
everything you want, all of it.

1393
02:14:39,030 --> 02:14:42,140
I'm just not sure
how to reconcile this...

1394
02:14:42,341 --> 02:14:45,617
Would you tell a blind man
he couldn't have children?

1395
02:14:45,851 --> 02:14:49,251
You be a father
for as long as you can.

1396
02:14:49,452 --> 02:14:52,452
I know the consequences.
I've accepted that.

1397
02:14:52,630 --> 02:14:56,460
Loving you was worth
everything to me.

1398
02:14:59,610 --> 02:15:02,265
I have to go pee.

1399
02:15:15,437 --> 02:15:17,867
<i>The oldest woman to ever
swim the English Channel</i>

1400
02:15:17,968 --> 02:15:19,673
<i>arrived here today, in Calais,</i>

1401
02:15:19,774 --> 02:15:21,387
Keep it!

1402
02:15:21,488 --> 02:15:24,967
<i>having made the swim in 34 hours,
22 minutes and 14 seconds.</i>

1403
02:15:25,068 --> 02:15:28,797
<i>68 years old Elizabeth Abbott,
arrived at 5:38 GMT,</i>

1404
02:15:28,998 --> 02:15:31,129
<i>exhausted but happy.</i>

1405
02:15:31,330 --> 02:15:34,788
<i>Mrs Abbott, how would you sum
up in words this achievement?</i>

1406
02:15:34,989 --> 02:15:39,650
<i>I suppose...
anything is possible.</i>

1407
02:15:44,898 --> 02:15:47,037
Are you ready?

1408
02:15:47,675 --> 02:15:49,302
Yeah.

1409
02:15:57,374 --> 02:16:01,596
In the spring,
on a day like any other...

1410
02:16:01,999 --> 02:16:04,734
I'll be back in an hour!

1411
02:16:08,758 --> 02:16:10,645
Honey!

1412
02:16:12,128 --> 02:16:14,638
Gotta call the ambulance!

1413
02:16:17,184 --> 02:16:19,451
The baby is coming.

1414
02:16:19,640 --> 02:16:22,490
Operator, I need an ambulance!

1415
02:17:04,110 --> 02:17:08,568
Everyone's fine. She's a
perfectly healthy baby girl.

1416
02:17:14,318 --> 02:17:16,119
Honey...

1417
02:17:17,658 --> 02:17:21,902
She gave birth to a five pound
four ounce baby girl.

1418
02:17:37,568 --> 02:17:40,318
Did you count the toes?

1419
02:17:43,526 --> 02:17:45,735
She's perfect.

1420
02:17:45,985 --> 02:17:50,026
"And we named her for
my mother, Caroline."

1421
02:17:52,526 --> 02:17:55,526
This Benjamin was my father?

1422
02:17:56,117 --> 02:17:59,117
And this is how you tell me?

1423
02:18:03,901 --> 02:18:06,026
Excuse me.

1424
02:18:16,110 --> 02:18:19,204
<i>...all the conditions are there
for the major storm,</i>

1425
02:18:19,405 --> 02:18:22,402
<i>possibly even up
to a cathegory 5.</i>

1426
02:18:27,901 --> 02:18:32,318
Hey, I know it's hard.
You can't smoke in here.

1427
02:18:34,747 --> 02:18:38,818
<i>Nobody can tell you exactly
where it's gonna hit...</i>

1428
02:18:49,693 --> 02:18:55,110
You grew as the doctor had
promised, normal and healthy.

1429
02:19:03,402 --> 02:19:07,283
You're gonna have to find
a real father for her.

1430
02:19:09,235 --> 02:19:11,285
What are you talking about?

1431
02:19:11,486 --> 02:19:14,741
She's gonna need someone
to grow old with.

1432
02:19:14,943 --> 02:19:17,943
She'll learn to accept whatever
happens. She loves you.

1433
02:19:18,193 --> 02:19:21,443
Honey, she needs a father,
not a playmate.

1434
02:19:24,277 --> 02:19:26,401
Is it me? -Of course not.

1435
02:19:26,577 --> 02:19:30,235
Is my age beginning to bother you?
Is that what you're telling me?

1436
02:19:30,443 --> 02:19:33,485
You can't raise both of us.

1437
02:19:40,831 --> 02:19:43,661
It was your first birthday.

1438
02:19:43,902 --> 02:19:48,118
We had a party for you. The
house was filled with children.

1439
02:19:48,318 --> 02:19:50,360
-How are you?
-Hey, man.

1440
02:19:50,568 --> 02:19:55,151
Before you turn around,
they'll be in high school, dating.

1441
02:20:26,402 --> 02:20:30,276
I sold the summer house
on Lake Pontchartrain.

1442
02:20:30,452 --> 02:20:32,995
I sold Button's Buttons.

1443
02:20:33,196 --> 02:20:35,818
I sold my father's sailboat.

1444
02:20:35,997 --> 02:20:39,198
I put it all into
a savings account.

1445
02:20:40,162 --> 02:20:44,568
And so that you and your
mother might have a life,

1446
02:20:44,776 --> 02:20:48,985
I left, before you could
ever remember me.

1447
02:21:38,276 --> 02:21:41,568
"I left with just the clothes
on my back."

1448
02:21:41,776 --> 02:21:44,485
I don't want to read this now.

1449
02:21:44,693 --> 02:21:47,747
Can you just tell me
where he went?

1450
02:21:47,949 --> 02:21:50,819
I don't really know.

1451
02:22:01,443 --> 02:22:05,241
It's for me. 1970. I was two.

1452
02:22:05,533 --> 02:22:08,360
"Happy birthday."

1453
02:22:09,034 --> 02:22:12,651
"I wish I could've
kissed you goodnight."

1454
02:22:16,985 --> 02:22:20,655
They are all for me.
Five:

1455
02:22:21,651 --> 02:22:25,860
"I wish I could've taken you
to your first day of school."

1456
02:22:29,360 --> 02:22:31,235
Six:

1457
02:22:32,068 --> 02:22:36,452
"I wish I could've been there
to teach you to play the piano."

1458
02:22:38,735 --> 02:22:41,610
1981, I was thirteen:

1459
02:22:41,818 --> 02:22:46,026
"I wish I could've told you
not to chase some boy."

1460
02:22:46,318 --> 02:22:50,818
"I wish I could've held you
when you had a broken heart."

1461
02:22:51,401 --> 02:22:54,818
"I wish I could've
been your father."

1462
02:22:55,027 --> 02:22:58,735
"Nothing I ever did
will replace that."

1463
02:23:04,818 --> 02:23:07,318
I guess he went to India.

1464
02:23:07,495 --> 02:23:10,702
For what it's worth,
it's never to late,

1465
02:23:10,903 --> 02:23:15,318
or in my case, too early,
to be whoever you want to be.

1466
02:23:19,027 --> 02:23:23,455
There is no time limit,
start whenever you want.

1467
02:23:24,693 --> 02:23:30,276
You can change or stay the same.
There are no rules to this thing.

1468
02:23:31,735 --> 02:23:35,151
We can make the best
or the worst of it.

1469
02:23:35,329 --> 02:23:38,235
I hope you make the best of it.

1470
02:23:40,735 --> 02:23:44,985
And I hope you see
things that startle you.

1471
02:23:45,693 --> 02:23:50,151
I hope you feel things
you never felt before.

1472
02:23:51,663 --> 02:23:55,901
I hope you meet people with
a different point of view.

1473
02:23:56,280 --> 02:23:59,985
I hope you live a life
you're proud of.

1474
02:24:01,860 --> 02:24:04,743
If you find that you're not,

1475
02:24:05,026 --> 02:24:10,077
I hope you have the strength
to start all over again.

1476
02:24:12,454 --> 02:24:15,776
He had been gone a long time.

1477
02:24:17,318 --> 02:24:20,235
I'll see you next thursday.

1478
02:24:22,402 --> 02:24:26,068
-Good night, miss Daisy.
-Good night, sweetheart.

1479
02:24:43,568 --> 02:24:46,651
I'm sorry, we're closing.

1480
02:24:48,443 --> 02:24:51,026
Can I help you?

1481
02:24:51,652 --> 02:24:55,110
Are you here to
pick somebody up?

1482
02:25:04,485 --> 02:25:07,360
Why did you come back?

1483
02:25:07,735 --> 02:25:09,360
Mom?

1484
02:25:10,151 --> 02:25:11,818
Mom!

1485
02:25:12,485 --> 02:25:14,818
You ready yet?

1486
02:25:16,985 --> 02:25:18,651
Mom, what's wrong?

1487
02:25:18,740 --> 02:25:22,151
I was just hearing a very sad
story about a mutual friend,

1488
02:25:22,236 --> 02:25:25,402
who I hadn't seen
for a very long time.

1489
02:25:25,610 --> 02:25:28,610
Caroline, this is Benjamin.

1490
02:25:28,818 --> 02:25:32,818
You knew him when
you were just a baby.

1491
02:25:33,401 --> 02:25:35,571
Hi. -Hi.

1492
02:25:37,193 --> 02:25:38,777
Hey!

1493
02:25:40,951 --> 02:25:43,526
I'm sorry, I thought
you were done.

1494
02:25:43,735 --> 02:25:47,659
Oh, this is a friend of my
family's, Benjamin Button.

1495
02:25:47,860 --> 02:25:52,028
This is my husband, Robert.
-How do you do.

1496
02:25:52,529 --> 02:25:54,610
Pleasure.

1497
02:26:01,610 --> 02:26:05,610
It was very nice to meet you.
We'll be in the car, darling.

1498
02:26:05,785 --> 02:26:07,901
Alright. -Bye.

1499
02:26:08,610 --> 02:26:11,026
I'm just locking up.

1500
02:26:18,574 --> 02:26:22,163
She's beautiful,
like her mother.

1501
02:26:22,777 --> 02:26:25,443
Does she dance?
-Not very well.

1502
02:26:25,527 --> 02:26:28,286
I guess that'd be from
my side of things.

1503
02:26:28,487 --> 02:26:30,901
She's a dear sweet girl.

1504
02:26:31,110 --> 02:26:35,193
She seems a little lost.
But then, who isn't at twelve?

1505
02:26:35,492 --> 02:26:39,568
There's a lot of her
that reminds me of you.

1506
02:26:40,318 --> 02:26:44,153
My husband, he's a widower
... was a widower.

1507
02:26:44,745 --> 02:26:48,985
He's an incredibly kind,
bright, adventurous man.

1508
02:26:51,744 --> 02:26:55,318
He's been a terrific father.
-Good.

1509
02:26:59,193 --> 02:27:03,443
You're so much younger.
-Only on the outside.

1510
02:27:05,198 --> 02:27:07,526
You were right.

1511
02:27:08,528 --> 02:27:11,985
I couldn't have been
raising both of you.

1512
02:27:12,193 --> 02:27:14,651
I'm not that strong.

1513
02:27:17,985 --> 02:27:20,860
So, where are you staying?

1514
02:27:22,193 --> 02:27:24,193
What are you gonna do?

1515
02:27:24,277 --> 02:27:27,943
I'm staying at the Pontchartrain
hotel on the avenue.

1516
02:27:28,151 --> 02:27:31,151
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

1517
02:27:38,994 --> 02:27:41,527
They're waiting.

1518
02:28:22,742 --> 02:28:26,370
I remember that.
That was him.

1519
02:28:28,235 --> 02:28:30,693
Hurricane's changed direction.
It's gonna make a landfall

1520
02:28:30,779 --> 02:28:32,779
some time soon. -Am I
supposed to do something?

1521
02:28:32,901 --> 02:28:34,985
Arrangements are being made to
move people, but it's up to you.

1522
02:28:35,110 --> 02:28:37,068
No, no, we're staying.

1523
02:28:37,276 --> 02:28:40,276
I'll let you know
if anything changes.

1524
02:28:41,776 --> 02:28:44,818
That night, while I was
sitting and wandering

1525
02:28:45,026 --> 02:28:49,068
why I came back at all,
there was a knock at the door.

1526
02:28:52,068 --> 02:28:54,152
Come in.

1527
02:29:07,777 --> 02:29:10,529
Are you alright?

1528
02:29:12,527 --> 02:29:16,776
I'm sorry, I don't know
what am I doing here.

1529
02:29:25,568 --> 02:29:28,068
Nothing lasts.

1530
02:29:30,827 --> 02:29:33,901
I never stopped loving you.

1531
02:29:39,193 --> 02:29:42,235
Benjamin, I'm an old woman now.

1532
02:29:52,235 --> 02:29:55,526
Some things you never forget.

1533
02:30:43,068 --> 02:30:45,318
Goodnight, Benjamin.

1534
02:30:46,287 --> 02:30:48,497
Goodnight, Daisy.

1535
02:30:51,318 --> 02:30:53,996
And as I knew I would...

1536
02:30:54,198 --> 02:30:56,652
I watched her go.

1537
02:30:58,193 --> 02:31:01,235
That's the last thing he wrote.

1538
02:31:01,824 --> 02:31:06,735
Some time after
your father passed,

1539
02:31:07,491 --> 02:31:10,360
there was a call.

1540
02:31:12,235 --> 02:31:15,693
Hello? Yes, speaking.

1541
02:31:19,443 --> 02:31:22,526
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

1542
02:31:31,443 --> 02:31:34,276
It's the corner house.

1543
02:31:55,776 --> 02:31:57,985
Come on in!

1544
02:32:02,658 --> 02:32:04,787
I'm Daisy Fuller.
-I'm David Hernandez

1545
02:32:04,988 --> 02:32:08,610
with the Orleans Parish dept
of Child Welfare Services.

1546
02:32:08,818 --> 02:32:12,068
He was living in the
condemned building.

1547
02:32:12,985 --> 02:32:16,243
The police found this
with him, this address,

1548
02:32:16,443 --> 02:32:19,235
it's got your name
in here a lot.

1549
02:32:19,568 --> 02:32:22,401
He's in a very poor health.
He was taken to the hospital.

1550
02:32:22,580 --> 02:32:26,456
He doesn't seem to know who or
where he is. He's very confused.

1551
02:32:26,658 --> 02:32:30,318
I was telling Mr Hernandez
that Benjamin is one of us.

1552
02:32:30,495 --> 02:32:34,568
If he needs a place to stay,
it's alright. He can stay here.

1553
02:33:03,276 --> 02:33:05,071
Benjamin.

1554
02:33:08,401 --> 02:33:11,068
You play beautifully.

1555
02:33:13,735 --> 02:33:15,818
He doesn't seem to
like to be touched.

1556
02:33:15,910 --> 02:33:17,985
He goes in and out of
states of recognition.

1557
02:33:18,068 --> 02:33:20,276
The doctors said if they
didn't know any better...

1558
02:33:20,360 --> 02:33:22,951
it is the beginnings
of dementia.

1559
02:33:23,451 --> 02:33:26,236
Do you remember me?

1560
02:33:28,443 --> 02:33:30,652
I'm Daisy.

1561
02:33:32,238 --> 02:33:34,581
I'm Benjamin.

1562
02:33:39,610 --> 02:33:42,735
It's nice to meet you, Benjamin.

1563
02:33:44,235 --> 02:33:49,493
Do you mind if I sit with you?
I would love to hear you play.

1564
02:33:53,318 --> 02:33:55,868
Do I know you?

1565
02:34:00,193 --> 02:34:05,777
And every day I would stop by
to make sure he was comfortable.

1566
02:34:07,985 --> 02:34:10,651
Don't think that I don't
know what you're doing!

1567
02:34:10,829 --> 02:34:13,193
You're all fucking liars!

1568
02:34:13,526 --> 02:34:17,320
He doesn't believe
he just had his breakfast.

1569
02:34:19,532 --> 02:34:24,943
Why don't we see if we can find
something else for you to do.

1570
02:34:25,151 --> 02:34:28,568
I have a feeling there's a lot
of things I can't remember.

1571
02:34:28,776 --> 02:34:31,235
Like what, sugar?

1572
02:34:31,943 --> 02:34:36,032
It's like...
there's this whole life I had,

1573
02:34:36,860 --> 02:34:40,068
and I can't remember what it was.

1574
02:34:42,235 --> 02:34:46,902
It's okay.
It's okay to forget things.

1575
02:34:47,318 --> 02:34:52,610
Many times he would simply
forget who or where he was.

1576
02:34:54,652 --> 02:34:57,276
It wasn't easy.
-Benjamin!

1577
02:34:57,485 --> 02:34:59,943
I can see everything!
I can see the big river!

1578
02:35:00,151 --> 02:35:02,610
That's right. You can see
everything, sweetheart.

1579
02:35:02,818 --> 02:35:06,026
I can see the graveyard where
mama's buried and other people.

1580
02:35:06,235 --> 02:35:09,943
I want you to come down!
-What if I can fly?

1581
02:35:10,151 --> 02:35:13,112
I knew a man who could fly.

1582
02:35:13,318 --> 02:35:16,776
Come down and I'll
tell you all about him.

1583
02:35:19,568 --> 02:35:22,328
Somebody go up there.

1584
02:35:27,699 --> 02:35:30,776
He was five when I moved in.

1585
02:35:30,985 --> 02:35:35,331
Nearly the same age I was
when I had met him.

1586
02:35:41,576 --> 02:35:47,401
This is the picture of Old Man
Kangaroo at 5 in the afternoon,

1587
02:35:48,027 --> 02:35:51,901
when he got his
beautiful hind legs.

1588
02:35:52,693 --> 02:35:58,360
The days passed, and I watched
as he forgot how to walk...

1589
02:36:03,527 --> 02:36:06,321
What's my name?
...how to talk.

1590
02:36:06,621 --> 02:36:08,735
I'm Daisy.

1591
02:36:08,943 --> 02:36:11,443
Can you say Daisy?

1592
02:36:12,485 --> 02:36:17,860
In 2002, they put up a new
clock in that train station.

1593
02:36:24,568 --> 02:36:28,610
And in the spring of 2003,

1594
02:36:32,443 --> 02:36:35,235
he looked at me,

1595
02:36:36,743 --> 02:36:41,622
and I knew that
he knew who I was.

1596
02:36:45,452 --> 02:36:51,276
And then he closed his eyes
as if he would go to sleep.

1597
02:37:23,693 --> 02:37:26,286
I wish I had known him.

1598
02:37:26,575 --> 02:37:28,779
Now you do.

1599
02:37:32,276 --> 02:37:36,526
Mom, I think I should go
see what's going on.

1600
02:37:43,235 --> 02:37:46,110
Goodnight, Benjamin.

1601
02:38:15,401 --> 02:38:19,030
Some people are born
to sit by a river.

1602
02:38:19,651 --> 02:38:22,610
Some get struck by lightning.

1603
02:38:23,443 --> 02:38:26,360
Some have an ear for music.

1604
02:38:27,193 --> 02:38:29,576
Some are artists.

1605
02:38:30,243 --> 02:38:32,287
Some swim.

1606
02:38:32,860 --> 02:38:35,485
Some know buttons.

1607
02:38:36,443 --> 02:38:40,902
Some know Shakespeare.
Some are mothers.

1608
02:38:42,776 --> 02:38:46,247
And some people... dance.

1609
02:39:18,652 --> 02:39:21,652
