2
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,720
Come on, time to go.
We haven't got all day.

3
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,750
Get that monkey on the train.

4
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,260
The Medici Brothers' circus
is taking off!

5
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,940
Breathing normal...

6
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,510
heart rate normal.

7
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,920
You're cleared to perform.

8
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,990
Milly!
Another train!

9
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,660
<i>Ninos,</i> wait!
We are coming, too!

10
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,740
Joplin!

11
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,540
Joplin, Missouri!

12
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,710
- Hey, sweetheart!
- Daddy!

13
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,710
Oh, I meant to tell ya.

14
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,080
You know,
in the letter I sent?

15
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,690
I'm so sorry
that I wasn't here.

16
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,060
Well, come here now.

17
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,490
Still me.

18
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,100
And you...

19
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,570
you're just as pretty
as your momma.

20
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:42,550
We missed you, Dad.

21
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,250
I missed you, too.

22
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,790
Ivan and Catherine,
thank you both...

23
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,560
for looking out for them.

24
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,020
Captain Farrier,
of course.

25
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,830
Oh, it's Holt, come on now.

26
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,160
It's just Holt.

27
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,760
Don't you worry.

28
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,630
Everything's gonna be
just like it was before.

29
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,870
Come on! Come on!

30
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,240
Home sweet home.

31
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,540
- Hey! Holt!
- Hey, Puck.

32
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,880
- Hey, Thomas.
- Milly, come on!

33
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,080
Hi, Holt.

34
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,720
Oh! Hey, Miss Atlantis.

35
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,850
Pramesh!

36
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,590
The very best journey,
dear friend.

37
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,020
The road that leads home.

38
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,890
Welcome home.

39
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,600
No hugs!

40
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,600
Pramesh,
I missed you, too.

41
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,770
What's going on? The camp's
half the size it used to be.

42
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,270
Hard times, my friend.
For everyone.

43
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,050
Attention, everybody!

44
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,980
Why is Rule Number One
called Rule Number One?

45
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,790
Because
"keep the cages locked"

46
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,060
is the most important
rule of all!

47
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,060
When I catch
that fugitive scalawag

48
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,760
who interrupted my dream...

49
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,730
Rongo!

50
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,060
Where is Rongo?

51
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:10,170
Who's heading
camp management?

52
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,400
I'm the strongman.

53
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,070
Yes, but we're all wearing
multiple hats!

54
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:17,910
You're in charge of budgets,
and accounting, and inventory.

55
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,410
Which means
animal whereabouts!

56
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,410
Now, go find that monkey!

57
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,320
I'll have a look around.

58
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,890
All right, everybody.
Back to work.

59
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,200
Holt!

60
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,940
This winter, the influenza
hit us like a hurricane.

61
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,410
Natalya, Vincenzo...

62
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,050
the Vanderjees, and then...

63
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,850
your wife.

64
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,150
Poor Annie.

65
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,890
How she fought.

66
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,200
She was the best of us.

67
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:15,260
I know it.

68
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:18,000
So, uh, you know, for her,

69
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,270
let's have
our best season yet!

70
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,210
Now where's my horses?

71
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,440
Ah...

72
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,310
Funny story about that.

73
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,840
Funny how?

74
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,910
He sold them.

75
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,710
But our act is the soul
of this show!

76
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,250
And first, we lost you,
and then Annie, to ride 'em!

77
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,720
If only Milly would have
learned the trade.

78
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,160
I don't wanna be a show-off
in your circus.

79
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,290
- "Show-off"?
- You see?

80
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,960
I wanna make
scientific discoveries.

81
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,760
I wanna be noticed
for my mind.

82
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,230
Okay.

83
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:51,870
Then learn clairvoyance.
Telepathy! Something!

84
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,900
I can do a handstand
for almost ten seconds.

85
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,310
Oh.

86
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,310
"Child does handstand."
We'll be broke by July.

87
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:04,080
Hang on now. Without horses,
what the hell's my act?

88
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,480
The crowds come to see me!

89
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,420
Max, please.

90
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,890
I need to work.

91
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,960
Good news.

92
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,790
One job, I have.

93
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,830
Okay, then.
Give me a showstopper.

94
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,500
You know that old rascal
Itchy McPhee?

95
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,200
He finally ran off
with the bearded lady.

96
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,300
I've been filling in with
roustabouts ever since.

97
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,440
I need somebody good
to tend the elephants.

98
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,470
No, you're not serious.

99
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,870
I am on occasion.

100
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,410
This is a big job
and you know it.

101
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,040
No, it's a big shovel
for a big pile of...

102
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:36,010
Dad.

103
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,880
So you sold my horses
and kept your elephants.

104
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:45,150
Your scrawny, mangy,
cut-rate elephants.

105
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,390
They're important.
Especially this season.

106
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,420
Why's that?

107
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,260
I know it goes
against my nature...

108
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:55,060
but for once,
I made an investment.

109
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:00,270
<i>Bellissima!</i>
There she is!

110
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:03,070
Our brand-new Asian female.

111
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:06,040
I bought her off
a Brugelbecker in Biloxi.

112
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,040
I had to get him
way down on the price.

113
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,810
But I swear to you, Holt,

114
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,910
I saw something special
in her eyes.

115
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,250
This is your investment?
An old, sick elephant.

116
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,360
Oh, no. She's not sick.

117
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,990
Any day now...

118
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:23,290
she's having a baby.

119
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,370
Dad, watch! Dad!
I'm getting better!

120
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,070
Hang on now,
this is our tent?

121
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,600
What happened to our things?

122
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,010
We had nice furniture,
we had rooms.

123
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,340
Max, what didn't you sell?

124
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,280
You son of a gun.

125
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,350
Dad, look!

126
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,250
Toys?

127
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,080
They're not toys.

128
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,550
They're for
my science experiments.

129
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,290
Well, we're a circus,
darlin', a circus.

130
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:55,020
We need to be practical
if we want to survive.

131
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,590
You couldn't
just take up one act?

132
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:00,030
Tumblin' or tightrope?

133
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,930
Maybe I don't need
the world staring at me.

134
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,970
Maybe I'm just not
you and Mom.

135
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,270
Well, who makes the rules
in this family?

136
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,170
Mom did.

137
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:09,370
Yeah, well,
I make them now.

138
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,470
So just, uh...
Go to your room!

139
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,910
This is my room.

140
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,440
This is all our rooms.

141
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,550
See this?

142
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,350
You know what this is?

143
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,920
It's your inheritance.

144
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,590
Dad!

145
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:29,020
Don't worry,
he's not going anywhere.

146
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,890
He's stuck here.

147
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,460
Like you and me.

148
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,910
Come on, come on,
you're missing it!

149
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,380
Look, I can do it!
I'm doing it, Milly!

150
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,250
A new season!

151
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,530
Let me in,
you little hairball!

152
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,440
Hey!

153
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,980
Would somebody please
let me in my own train?

154
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,450
Dad, wake up! Let's go!

155
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,720
The elephants need us!

156
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,190
Good God, son,

157
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,660
you're gonna make me
miss the war.

158
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,990
Gimme that.

159
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,300
Go on, lead the way.

160
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,170
Move it!

161
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,330
Let's skedaddle, Mrs. Jumbo!

162
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,240
Don't make me
have to incentivize.

163
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,240
Get her out of there, boys.

164
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,140
Easy, Rufus.

165
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,710
That's a lady in there.

166
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:33,350
Well, well, our own Tom Mix
ridin' in to the rescue.

167
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,580
But he just ain't
on the marquee no more.

168
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,320
Time to see
what he's been missing.

169
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,020
Do you ever
get that feeling?

170
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,450
Like there's something
you're missing?

171
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,690
Imagine my surprise,
you didn't enlist.

172
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:45,360
- Weak ticker. Doc's advice.
- Uh-huh.

173
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,260
Dad? Something's wrong.

174
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,600
She doesn't wanna leave.

175
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,600
Come on!

176
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,170
Let's get her outta there!

177
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,010
- What are you doing?
- Come on!

178
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,710
Leave her alone!

179
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,310
- Stop hurting her, please!
- Leave her alone!

180
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,390
Dad, look.

181
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,700
What now?

182
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,100
Move her!

183
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:29,130
Whoa, we got
a baby in here.

184
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,840
She had a baby!

185
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,110
- Baby!
- Huh?

186
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,280
Notify the press!

187
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,550
"The Medici Brothers...

188
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,610
"proudly present
America's newest,

189
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,550
"precious bundle of joy!"

190
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,720
Look at that.

191
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,290
It's okay now.

192
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,530
Don't be scared.

193
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,600
Don't be scared now,
your momma's right outside.

194
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,600
Baby! We got a baby!

195
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,200
We got a baby!

196
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,870
What is that?

197
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,170
Baby Jumbo.

198
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,480
I already got fake freaks
in the freak show!

199
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,710
I don't need a real one
in the center ring!

200
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,680
Rongo!
We've been swindled!

201
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,650
Gone and
bought yourself a baby monster.

202
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:54,690
Think he can hear me?

203
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,720
Boo!

204
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:18,440
Rongo!

Tell me you didn't do it.

211
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,430
You did it?

212
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,560
Never do anything I tell ya

213
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,530
without checking
with me first!

214
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,910
Why me? Why me?

215
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:50,210
A face
only a mother could love.

216
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:51,380
Sir?

217
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,680
Many of us
find you handsome.

218
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,520
I was talking
about the elephant!

219
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,820
Look, she's drawing him
a bath.

220
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,560
Need a vet to come
to look at him, Max.

221
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,360
No, no witnesses!

222
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,260
We are going to be in Joplin
for two weeks.

223
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,870
We promised them
a beautiful baby!

224
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:18,340
You have until tomorrow
night to fix that!

225
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,870
- Me?
- Yes, you!

226
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,240
This is my problem?

227
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,540
Yes.
You tend the elephants.

228
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,410
Make those ears disappear!

229
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,220
Don't look at me.

230
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:44,760
Look at him, those
giant ears weigh him down.

231
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,830
Hi, Baby Jumbo.

232
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,700
Welcome to the circus.

233
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,640
We're all family here.
No matter how small.

234
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:58,280
Aren't elephants
afraid of mice?

235
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,580
Says who?
That's why we experiment.

236
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,780
Someone needs to
keep him company.

237
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,980
when he's not with his momma.

238
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,560
Look. Give him one.

239
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,730
If he can lift his ears
out of the way.

240
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:23,900
No. You have to blow
your ears out of the way.

241
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,770
Like this.

242
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,370
Good luck with that.

243
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,410
Maybe you can teach him
to juggle, too.

244
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,010
Baby Jumbo, look at me.

245
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,350
Do what I do.

246
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,580
Blow.

247
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,390
No, not the feather.
Your ears. Blow!

248
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:50,360
He thinks it's a game.

249
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,430
- Oh, Max, come here.
- What?

250
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,370
Watch this.

251
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:58,540
I ride out, I do some jumps,
then all of a sudden...

252
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,540
stampede!

253
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,610
Send 'em!

254
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:04,610
Get out of the way, Max!

255
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,980
I'm, uh, still working out
the timing.

256
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,590
Let me have a turn.

257
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,700
Meanwhile, for when you

258
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,910
- lead out the elephants...
- Uh-huh.

259
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,010
I had the
costume departments

260
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,110
make you up
a little something.

261
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,010
Okay.

262
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,040
What in gosh...

263
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:43,010
You really broke the bank
with this, Max.

264
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,650
A lot of kids
come to the show.

265
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,450
You don't want me to
scare anyone, I get it.

266
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:47,580
Dad, Dad!

267
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,990
It's Baby Jumbo.
Come see.

268
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,950
He jumped in the air.
With his ears.

269
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,620
Guys,
I said leave him be.

270
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,760
But he was this
far off the ground!

271
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,090
Yeah, I bet he was.

272
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,960
He'll be tripping all over
with ears like that.

273
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,860
Dad, really.
We tried an experiment.

274
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,570
Just leave the poor guy alone.

275
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,800
First rule of science,
you have to have interest.

276
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:10,110
Otherwise,
you don't deserve to know.

277
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:15,410
It's been a rough year
for both of them.

278
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:17,020
Annie knew
how to talk to 'em.

279
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,950
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

280
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,520
<i>boys and girls,
step right up.</i>

281
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,660
<i>Hurry, hurry.</i>

282
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,660
<i>Come see the circus today.</i>

283
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:37,830
"To be or not to be...

284
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,070
"that is the question.

285
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,000
"Whether 'tis
nobler in the mind

286
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,940
"to suffer the slings and
arrows of outrageous..."

287
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,160
That ain't no snake.

288
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,960
Heck, I could do it.

289
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,600
As you wish.

290
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,170
Get out of here!

291
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,140
Rongo, let's go!

292
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:17,440
Hey, get away
from the baby elephant!

293
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,130
Welcome, Joplin, Missouri!

294
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,230
Ladies and gentlemen...

295
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,570
I am
your Master of Ceremonies,

296
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:50,540
Maximilian Medici.

297
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,840
And now, I give to you...

298
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:57,210
the Medici Brothers' circus.

299
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:06,920
Okay.

300
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,720
Okay, okay,
no one's gonna hurt him.

301
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:11,490
Okay, little guy,
let's put on a show.

302
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:41,760
Hey, ain't that Holt Farrier,
the Stallion Star?

303
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,160
Hey!
Ain't you Holt Farrier?

304
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,660
Nah, he died
in the war. So sad.

305
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,570
Aw!

306
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,940
Aw!

307
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:03,950
What's he doing?

308
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:12,590
He's reaching
for the feathers.

309
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,900
Coat, coat, coat, coat!

310
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,050
Ooh...

311
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:43,720
What'd you do to that thing?
That ain't a real elephant.

312
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,290
Those ears are fake!

313
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:47,190
Look! Look at the sign!

314
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,990
"Dumbo!"

315
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,130
Uh-oh.

316
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:59,300
Whoa, calm down, now.

317
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,110
He's a fake!

318
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,370
Yeah, he's a fake!

319
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,040
Shut up!

320
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,180
You're scaring the elephants!

321
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,980
Take it easy now.
Calm down.

322
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,980
Dumbo,
Dumbo, fake, fake, fake!

323
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,350
All right, sit down.

324
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,120
Dumbo, Dumbo,
fake, fake, fake!

325
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,160
I said sit down!

326
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,330
It's okay, little fella.

327
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,160
Fake!

328
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,900
Rongo! Music!

329
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,000
Happiness, joy!

330
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:41,980
Hear 'em making
fun of your ugly baby?

331
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,880
Who's gonna help him now?

332
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:49,680
Holt, get those ears
off the stage!

333
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,790
Whoa!

334
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,290
Okay, all right.

335
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,700
Okay, nobody's gonna
hurt your baby.

336
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,800
Just calm down.

337
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,770
Okay. Attagirl.

338
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:08,640
We're here to protect him.
Same as you.

339
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:11,910
Attagirl.

340
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,110
Nice and easy.

341
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,110
Shh. Okay, nobody's gonna
hurt your baby.

342
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,820
Rufus, no!

343
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:26,290
- Rufus, stop!
- Mad elephant!

344
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,350
Get back!

345
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,400
Max, get the kids out of here!

346
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,260
Everybody, out!
Get to safety.

347
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,800
Careful, careful.

348
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:47,240
Kids?

349
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,780
Go, go, go!

350
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,880
Quick, quick, quick.
Go, go, go.

351
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,910
Come on. This way, come on.

352
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,280
How do you like your job now,
cowboy?

353
00:24:58,090 --> 00:24:58,950
Uh-oh.

354
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,790
Milly, Joe! Come on!

355
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:08,000
Let's go!
Come on!

356
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,130
And I wanna
just emphasize,

357
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:44,800
we did everything right.

358
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,800
What it is, the tent
just absolutely fell down.

359
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,200
It just collapsed.

360
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,110
And we had no way of knowing
what was gonna happen.

361
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,670
Brugelbecker,
I have a man dead,

362
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:01,030
do you understand?

363
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:02,670
This is what they're reading

364
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:04,240
from the Great Lakes
to the Gulf!

365
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,310
You have
a moral responsibility

366
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,310
to buy
your killer elephant back.

367
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:10,480
What about the baby?

368
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,550
Well, at least
he got a few laughs.

369
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,150
I'll put him
in the clown act,

370
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,320
see if I can
salvage something.

371
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,150
I'll buy her back half price.

372
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,390
You will buy her back
full price.

373
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:26,630
Quarter price.

374
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:29,160
Half price it is!

375
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:35,940
Up!

376
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:41,110
What's happening?
Where are they taking her?

377
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,310
Away.
Back to your tent now.

378
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:44,110
But she's his mom!

379
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:46,080
Dad, please.
Stop them.

380
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,350
Please!

381
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,750
Do something.

382
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,420
Mom would have
done something.

383
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,950
Momma's not here.

384
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:01,390
Okay, little fella.
Okay. Come on.

385
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,260
I know, I do.

386
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:10,500
Beautiful creature,
we'll take care of your son.

387
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,450
Darlin', it's late.

388
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:36,320
Go on now.

389
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:33,240
I know.
I can't sleep, either.

390
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,610
My momma told me
there'd be times

391
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:39,780
when my life seemed
locked behind a door.

392
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:46,190
So, she gave me this key,
that her momma gave her.

393
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:49,690
And said
whenever I have that feeling,

394
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,760
imagine that door...

395
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,860
and just turn the key.

396
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,740
So, I keep trying.

397
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,940
Not supposed to
be in here alone.

398
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:09,910
I'm not. You're here.

399
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,480
What's that?

400
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,950
I just thought
he might be hungry.

401
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,550
He's sad.

402
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,250
You don't eat
when you're sad.

403
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,590
The mermaid does.

404
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:23,290
Come on.

405
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,730
Have one, Dumbo.

406
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,730
We're calling him Dumbo now?

407
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:29,870
If we call him
Jumbo Junior...

408
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:32,440
it might make him
miss his mom.

409
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:41,850
Here you go... Dumbo.

410
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:44,650
Come on,
and flap those ears again.

411
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:46,750
To show us
we didn't imagine it.

412
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:54,430
Your momma, she didn't
mean to hurt anyone.

413
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,560
She was just protecting you.

414
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,200
And we think
your ears are great.

415
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,800
Maybe he wants to be alone.
Like Dad.

416
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,810
Nobody wants to be alone.

417
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,740
Well...

418
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,350
if you change your mind...

419
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,890
Night-night, Dumbo.

420
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,750
Wow!

421
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,950
It's not the peanuts
that made him do it.

422
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,320
It's the feathers!

423
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,460
Dumbo!

424
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,960
Dumbo, you gotta do this
in the show.

425
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,660
What do you mean?

426
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,030
'Cause if the circus
sells more tickets

427
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,470
and Medici makes
more money...

428
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:44,630
then we can get him
to use some

429
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,630
to buy Mrs. Jumbo back.

430
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,800
Yeah!

431
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,370
We can get her back, Dumbo.
You can.

432
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:51,070
Just show them all
what you can do.

433
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,670
Come on.
We gotta tell Dad.

434
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,540
No. He'll just tell us
to be practical.

435
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,510
Shows got canceled
for a week, right?

436
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,550
We can research
and study and test.

437
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:04,390
You're a miracle elephant,
Dumbo.

438
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:06,520
And we're gonna
bring your momma home.

439
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:11,360
Fire!

440
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:33,950
So low.

441
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:35,620
An all-time low.

442
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,550
Who said he didn't want
to be recognized?

443
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:42,760
Okay, Big D, this is it.
Just like in rehearsal.

444
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,790
Except for lights, music,
fire and crowds.

445
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:46,660
- You can do it.
- Come on, Dumbo.

446
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:49,870
You can do it, Dumbo!

447
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:51,000
Show 'em all
like you showed us!

448
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,140
- Come! Come! Come!
- Attaboy, come on.

449
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,110
Keep comin'. Come on.

450
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,950
Go on now, Dumbo!
Come on.

451
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:11,490
Whoa.

452
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,760
Hey! Hey!

453
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,780
They love it! They love it!

454
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,750
All right, Dumbo.

455
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,960
You put out the fire.

456
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,810
He won't fly.
He's scared.

457
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:09,640
I know.
Now, he's up too high.

458
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:17,790
Go on, Dumbo!

459
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,000
Attaboy.

460
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:38,770
Yeah!
Rule Number One.

461
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,540
"Always have a big finish!"

462
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:45,710
Aw!

463
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,720
Okay, guys.
Bring him down.

464
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:53,990
Yeah!

465
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:07,100
Holt!

466
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,740
- Look, Max!
- What? What?

467
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,510
- He's trapped up there.
- Put the fire out!

468
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,240
Dumbo! Fly!

469
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,680
He won't fly
without a feather!

470
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:22,720
Put the fire out!

471
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,820
Put it out!

472
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,890
- Joe!
- Stop!

473
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,990
Holt, I thought she didn't
want to be in an act.

474
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,060
Milly!

475
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:53,680
Here, Dumbo!

476
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,180
Come on.

477
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,920
Show 'em.

478
00:38:58,690 --> 00:38:59,960
Come on, Dumbo.

479
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,210
Fly, Dumbo.

480
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,150
Fly!

481
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,830
Whoa!

482
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,200
Yeah!

483
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,400
You knew
he could do this?

484
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:26,710
You should talk
to your kids more.

485
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:38,450
Sotheby...

486
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:40,690
cancel my dinner
with the president.

487
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:42,960
We've got business
with an elephant.

488
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:47,730
Friends,

489
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:51,000
the next available shows
are in Arkansas!

490
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:53,300
<i>♪ Happy clowns!</i>

491
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:01,370
- Ah, Rongo the Strong!
- Boss.

492
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,910
Hello, Jo!

493
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:05,280
The Medici Brothers' circus.

494
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,220
Where true love
and mystery abound!

495
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:12,280
Now where's my star?

496
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:15,420
Ah, Dumbo!

497
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,760
How's your bath?

498
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,790
Too warm? Too cold?

499
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:21,990
Ladies, make sure his wrinkles
don't get wrinkles.

500
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,400
In our country,
legend tells us

501
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,170
the gods can
take animal forms.

502
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:28,930
Champagne for Dumbo!

503
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:31,010
No booze near the baby!

504
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,230
Sorry, Dumbo.

505
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,900
It's not your momma.

506
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,530
Take Dumbo back inside.

507
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,380
Ladies and gentlemen,
please make way

508
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,140
for the emperor
of enchantment.

509
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:13,480
For the architect of dreams.

510
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,810
For the Columbus
of Coney Island.

511
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,780
Mr. V.A. Vandevere!

512
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:25,260
And traveling with him,
his bright shining star.

513
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:28,830
Colette Marchant,
the Queen of the Heavens!

514
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:30,360
Miss Marchant!
Miss Marchant!

515
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:34,930
Ah.

516
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:37,270
<i>Signore</i> Medici!

517
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:39,800
He knows who I am.

518
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:41,340
We were just
passing through Missouri...

519
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:43,380
and we heard you were
putting on a little show.

520
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:47,080
Mr. Vandevere.
It's an honor.

521
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:50,050
No, sir.
The honor is mine.

522
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:54,120
I would like
to offer you a drink.

523
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,460
But I'm all out of bourbon.

524
00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:00,830
And cognac and scotch.

525
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,400
Not now!

526
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:12,440
Is that a monkey
in your desk?

527
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:14,940
Just for emergencies.

528
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,240
Look, Mr. Vandevere...

529
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,010
I probably should tell you...

530
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:21,410
the elephant is not for sale.

531
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:24,050
Dumbo will only fly
for the Medici circus.

532
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:26,390
That's assuming he is real.

533
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:34,990
See for yourself.

534
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:37,360
And all due respect,
I don't got all day.

535
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,930
- Pleasure to meet you...
- Excuse me.

536
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,130
Hello there.

537
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:51,340
So this, uh,
creature of yours...

538
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:53,080
is supposed to fly?

539
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:56,110
Trade secrets.

540
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:00,920
Ugh.

541
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:08,890
Uh, Max,
if you don't mind my asking...

542
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:13,360
where did you
come upon the animal?

543
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:15,530
He hails
from the far east.

544
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:16,970
How far?

545
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:18,370
Far.

546
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:21,340
He doesn't look
like "magic" to me.

547
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:24,040
Well, what the heck can you
tell by appearances, right?

548
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:27,040
And you train
flying elephants, too?

549
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:28,510
Yeah, it's a little hobby
on the side.

550
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,390
It's the kids taught Dumbo.

551
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:37,990
Ah, yes.

552
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:42,630
Yeah?

553
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:46,260
And how on earth
did you do that?

554
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:47,670
With the
scientific method.

555
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,000
One picture, one picture!

556
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,700
Max.

557
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:56,510
You possess something
that's very rare in life.

558
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:59,210
And the tragedy of it is,

559
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:02,110
is you don't even know
that you have it.

560
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:04,720
Do you know what it is
that you have, Max?

561
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,980
No.

562
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:07,290
It's mystique.

563
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,220
Max, I know your type.

564
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:13,590
Charlatan, con man,
opportunist...

565
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:16,660
New York is that way,
in case you need directions.

566
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:19,230
And I know it comes
from a deep desire

567
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:21,160
to build something
authentic and true.

568
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:23,000
I know your game.

569
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,330
It's not a game.

570
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:27,640
Some men cheat the rules,
others change them.

571
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:30,180
It's up your sleeve.

572
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:33,250
It's in your pocket.

573
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:42,050
The secret
to show business

574
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:43,620
is always keep a rabbit
in your hat.

575
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:46,260
Or a monkey in your desk,
I guess.

576
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:49,390
Ownership shares?

577
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:50,660
Max, look around you.

578
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:53,100
Your entire way of life
is dying.

579
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:54,660
The future of the
entertainment business

580
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:56,500
is to bring
the audience to you.

581
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,440
And I've built
that destination.

582
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:01,070
What I'm lacking...

583
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:03,210
is a protege.

584
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:09,380
I know
there's no Medici Brothers.

585
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:13,450
You probably always
wanted one.

586
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:16,250
You're offering me
a partnership?

587
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:17,420
Yes.

588
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:19,260
And a home.

589
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,260
For you
and the entire troupe.

590
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:24,360
A home?
For all of us?

591
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:26,700
Yes. Join me.

592
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,800
Join me and my family.

593
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,570
Let me take us all
into the future.

594
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:33,570
Let me take us all...

595
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:36,540
to Dreamland!

596
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:22,250
I wish Momma
could've seen this.

597
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:24,520
Well, somehow,
I think she knows we're here.

598
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:32,300
Way to work your magic, Max.

599
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:45,410
We hear you, Dumbo!

600
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:46,880
Why won't you
let him see outside?

601
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,340
Remember, young lady...

602
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:50,550
mystique.

603
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:57,090
Now this is why
I joined the circus.

604
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:03,360
Dad.
Wonders of Science!

605
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:04,630
All right, sugar plum.

606
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:06,430
Remember, we got
a job to do here.

607
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:09,160
My daughter, she fancies
herself the next Marie Curie.

608
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:12,870
Don't ever let anybody
tell you what you can't do.

609
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:15,640
Hang on,
I wasn't saying she can't.

610
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:20,180
What is it exactly that
we do here, <i>ma cherie?</i>

611
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:23,710
We make
the impossible possible.

612
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:30,390
And that's where
you'll perform.

613
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:31,690
The Colosseum!

614
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:34,660
Dumbo will stay
in the training tent behind.

615
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:35,760
Dumbo!

616
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:42,830
Why aren't we
going with him?

617
00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:46,700
Because that
is your new home.

618
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:53,380
Wow!

619
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:56,410
Look at this place!

620
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:57,780
A library...

621
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:59,820
"And the children
shall lead them."

622
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:01,850
We're grateful for the
opportunity, Mr. Vandevere.

623
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:04,890
Oh, your family's mine.

624
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:10,930
You know, I've been brushing
up on your story, Mr. Farrier.

625
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:13,230
Kentucky's top trick rider.

626
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:14,630
Well, there's no reason
you can't be again...

627
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:17,800
only here,
you'd be Captain Farrier...

628
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:18,930
war hero.

629
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:22,740
One-armed wonder.

630
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:24,270
National treasure.

631
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:26,370
Wow!

632
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,640
Well, I still can ride.

633
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:28,840
Oh, I know you can.

634
00:49:28,850 --> 00:49:31,310
And you're going to.

635
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:32,750
Right after you get
that little elephant

636
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:33,980
off the ground for me.

637
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:35,780
You mean
once his act's working?

638
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:37,550
You're back in the saddle.

639
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:39,550
We're still working
on the schedule

640
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,690
for the rest
of your troupe...

641
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:42,720
but on Friday...

642
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:44,460
we premiere
our little Dumbo.

643
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:48,900
I get goose bumps.

644
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:53,670
Why are you
looking at me?

645
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:55,540
Well, because
the only thing

646
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:58,640
more amazing
than a flying elephant...

647
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,180
is the goddess
who can fly it.

648
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:03,850
Have you lost your mind?

649
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,750
Let's not forget from
whence we came, darling.

650
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:13,820
So, we fly Friday!

651
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:17,960
Uh, Dumbo's never flown
with anyone.

652
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:20,930
That's why it's become
abundantly clear

653
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:21,930
why we need you.

654
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:25,600
Dumbo!

655
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:31,740
Hey, buddy. We missed you.
You all right?

656
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:34,540
Hey. Captain Farrier
is in charge.

657
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:36,480
No one sees the animal
without his approval.

658
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:37,950
Holt.

659
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:39,480
Just call me Holt.

660
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:42,820
I thought you were
a military man.

661
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:45,290
Nice boots you bagged there.
What are they, shark skin?

662
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:48,290
No.

663
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:49,560
So you better keep
your elephant friend

664
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:50,890
on my good side.

665
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,370
Hiya, Dumbo.

666
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:06,570
Dumbo, you mind?

667
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:07,680
Can I get my arm?

668
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,380
And these are the hands
I'll be putting my life in?

669
00:51:11,950 --> 00:51:13,850
Welcome.

670
00:51:13,850 --> 00:51:16,450
For the record,
this was not my idea.

671
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:17,920
Dumbo works alone.

672
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,520
So do I.

673
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:22,760
<i>Bonjour,</i> Milly, Joe...

674
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:26,030
And you...

675
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,660
Hmm, charming.

676
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:31,930
Well, maybe he doesn't
recognize you

677
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:34,470
without your makeup.

678
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:36,340
So I gotta
teach you to fly?

679
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:40,670
I know how to fly,
ever since I was a child.

680
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,980
They taught
Dumbo to fly, no?

681
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:44,710
So I don't need
your expertise.

682
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,820
All right.

683
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:51,450
Well, just so you know,
I've been to France.

684
00:51:51,450 --> 00:51:53,020
It wasn't a good experience.

685
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:54,990
Show me your secret!

686
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:57,020
How on earth
does your elephant fly?

687
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:59,430
Well, first,
he needs a feather.

688
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,300
He won't fly
without a feather.

689
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:06,570
Well then,
neither will I.

690
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,060
Whoa, slow down, princess.
Safety first.

691
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:37,400
Guys, nets.

692
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,570
Come on, hurry.

693
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:43,470
All right, guys, good.

694
00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:53,920
See, Dumbo?

695
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:57,120
I fly!

696
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:07,360
See if you can catch me!

697
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,700
Here, Dumbo!

698
00:54:11,890 --> 00:54:14,200
Oh, we got some work to do.

699
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:25,270
Friends and colleagues...

700
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:26,670
let's give a warm
Dreamland welcome

701
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:28,040
to our new executive
vice president...

702
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:29,010
Mr. Max Medici.

703
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:34,050
Anything he needs,
anything at all...

704
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:35,980
make it happen
as you always do.

705
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:42,520
This is Miss Verna.

706
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:43,890
She will handle
your schedule,

707
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:46,260
correspondence,
and all your calls.

708
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:48,030
When you're needed
in meetings,

709
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:49,630
she'll let you know.

710
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:51,000
Are there meetings today?

711
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,730
I'll let you know!

712
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,870
Uh, Mr. Vandevere,
one question.

713
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:59,070
Exactly what do I do?

714
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,610
So where'd
Vandevere find you?

715
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,150
I was a street performer
in Paris.

716
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:12,150
He discovered me.

717
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:13,950
And here I am.

718
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:18,020
A millionaire's girlfriend.

719
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:19,230
That's a tough break.

720
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,000
It's all for show.

721
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,660
So you and he,
you're not, uh...

722
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:27,330
I'm one of many
gems he wears

723
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:28,870
to reflect the light
back onto him.

724
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:31,140
Huh.

725
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:34,810
Good boy, Dumbo.

726
00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:36,610
- Good job.
- Yeah! They're gonna love him.

727
00:55:36,610 --> 00:55:38,110
I think you are
the lucky one.

728
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,250
- Well done, Dumbo.
- Good boy.

729
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:45,590
Who's been dreaming
like I've been dreaming?

730
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:49,620
So, how's everything?

731
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:51,320
- Good?
- Oh, we're making progress.

732
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:53,060
But he ain't
quite ready yet.

733
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:55,830
What's the problem?
Doesn't the animal trust you?

734
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:58,200
- It's not that simple.
- <i>Ma cherie...</i>

735
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:01,900
we've already sold
all the tickets.

736
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,700
Maybe our little
scientist here

737
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:05,570
can show us
that it's going to work.

738
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:19,850
Prepare for takeoff.

739
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:21,020
- Right wing?
- Check!

740
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:24,120
Left wing?

741
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,090
Check!

742
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:28,200
Take her up, Dumbo.

743
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,870
Let's go.

744
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:35,340
- Come on, buddy. Come on.
- Come on, Dumbo.

745
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,140
That's it. Come on.

746
00:56:45,810 --> 00:56:46,880
Let's try it again.

747
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,620
You got this.
Here you go.

748
00:57:05,270 --> 00:57:07,670
You beautiful
one-armed cowboy.

749
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:11,110
You've made me
a child again.

750
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:26,020
<i>Welcome to the Colosseum...</i>

751
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:28,790
<i>where the impossible
is possible.</i>

752
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:15,330
<i>Buonasera.</i> Max Medici.

753
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:17,770
I discovered the elephant,
my elephant.

754
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:19,100
And basically I said no.

755
00:58:19,110 --> 00:58:20,800
I walked out and that
was the end of that.

756
00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:22,140
The flying
elephant's mine.

757
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:23,140
Yeah.

758
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:26,180
You're the guy!

759
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:28,980
You're the guy that's
made out of magic dust!

760
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:30,210
Max.

761
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:32,780
J. Griffin Remington.
Atlas Forge Bank.

762
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:35,090
He's the money man.

763
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:36,350
The J?

764
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:39,190
Whoa! It's a pleasure
to meet you.

765
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:40,990
How are you?

766
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:42,330
You know, they say the moon
is made out of magic dust.

767
00:58:42,330 --> 00:58:43,930
That's why
they're going to send

768
00:58:43,930 --> 00:58:45,360
a man up there
one of these days.

769
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:47,530
And my bank is
going to be the bank

770
00:58:47,530 --> 00:58:50,270
that finances
the expedition.

771
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:51,400
What do you think of that?

772
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:52,800
Uh-huh.

773
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,140
Needless to say, Max...

774
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:56,010
we all have high hopes
for tonight.

775
00:58:56,010 --> 00:58:58,980
Oh, yeah. High hopes.
High hopes.

776
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:00,810
Well, you know,
hopes, and dreams,

777
00:59:00,810 --> 00:59:02,280
that's one thing.
That's words.

778
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:04,450
But what we're talking
about here is facts!

779
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:05,780
Plans!

780
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:08,120
Plans! That takes
a lot of money.

781
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,820
Which he hasn't got!

782
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:11,420
So, we are hoping
that your pachyderm

783
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:13,290
comes through
with the goods.

784
00:59:13,290 --> 00:59:16,190
Now let's get this show
on the road!

785
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:24,370
We are looking good!

786
00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:27,570
Don't worry, Big D.

787
00:59:27,570 --> 00:59:29,340
There's just more room to fly out
there, that's all.

788
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:31,910
Round and round,
just like we practiced.

789
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:34,310
And then Dad can talk
to Vandevere about the deal!

790
00:59:34,310 --> 00:59:35,380
About the what?

791
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:36,910
We made a deal with Dumbo.

792
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:38,350
We promised we'd buy
his mom back

793
00:59:38,350 --> 00:59:39,980
with all the money
he makes for the circus.

794
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:41,120
That's why he flies.

795
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,850
- Joe, not now!
- Are we ready?

796
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:46,090
Yeah.

797
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,060
Okay, let's go.

798
00:59:54,070 --> 00:59:56,770
Okay, Dumbo, let's do this.

799
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:57,630
Pink elephants?

800
01:00:57,630 --> 01:00:59,060
So?

801
01:01:58,190 --> 01:02:03,090
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls of all ages!</i>

802
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:07,200
<i>This is the moment
we've all been waiting for!</i>

803
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,330
<i>V.A. Vandevere,</i>

804
01:02:09,330 --> 01:02:11,530
<i>in association
with Max Medici...</i>

805
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:16,200
<i>proudly presents,
making his Dreamland debut...</i>

806
01:02:16,210 --> 01:02:18,610
<i>You've seen a horse-fly.</i>

807
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:21,280
<i>You've seen a dragonfly.</i>

808
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:24,210
<i>You've even seen a housefly.</i>

809
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:26,380
<i>But you haven't
seen anything...</i>

810
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:30,320
<i>until you see
an elephant fly.</i>

811
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:33,290
<i>Let's get ready for Dumbo!</i>

812
01:02:50,510 --> 01:02:52,080
Coming through.

813
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:55,080
Come on.

814
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:14,500
He can do it.

815
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:18,340
I know he can.

816
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:25,170
<i>And here to welcome him...</i>

817
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:30,210
<i>our own Queen of the Heavens!</i>

818
01:04:21,230 --> 01:04:24,160
Dumbo.

819
01:04:24,170 --> 01:04:27,440
Five times around the ring.
That's all we have to do.

820
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,070
Nice and easy,
like we practiced.

821
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:38,450
- Dad?
- Mmm-hmm.

822
01:04:38,450 --> 01:04:39,450
Why aren't they
putting up the nets?

823
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:44,220
Hey, guys?

824
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:45,550
Guys, what's going on?

825
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:46,760
Your men are supposed
to be out there!

826
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:47,560
Change of plan.
From the top.

827
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:01,370
I can't see the nets.

828
01:05:01,370 --> 01:05:03,740
- They're invisible.
- Hmm.

829
01:05:05,210 --> 01:05:06,810
What's wrong with you?
They need nets!

830
01:05:09,210 --> 01:05:10,140
Colette!

831
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:11,650
Wait, don't take off!

832
01:05:13,450 --> 01:05:14,680
Dumbo...

833
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:15,720
Oh, boy!

834
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:17,390
...Prince of the Elephants.

835
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:22,190
I command you
to fly with me.

836
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:54,420
Colette!

837
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:11,840
Lower the platform!

838
01:06:30,230 --> 01:06:32,230
Fly, little one!

839
01:06:51,710 --> 01:06:53,380
Magic dust!

840
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:22,480
Where's my show?

841
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:47,970
The elephant's headed
to Nightmare Island.

842
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:10,590
Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

843
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,030
Dumbo, it's okay.

844
01:08:48,030 --> 01:08:49,900
We're here.

845
01:08:50,930 --> 01:08:52,400
Good evening.

846
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:53,870
It's Mr. Vandevere.

847
01:08:53,870 --> 01:08:55,070
- Hello, hi.
- Hey, that's V.A. Vandevere!

848
01:08:55,070 --> 01:08:56,400
Everyone having fun?

849
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:57,770
Good.

850
01:08:57,770 --> 01:08:59,540
- Having a good time?
- Yes, sir.

851
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:01,370
Fantastic.

852
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:03,840
Get him outta here.

853
01:09:03,850 --> 01:09:05,440
- Yes.
- Over here!

854
01:09:05,450 --> 01:09:06,780
- Folks, please.
- Hello.

855
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:08,580
Folks, I need you
to leave the exhibit.

856
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:10,620
Come on.

857
01:09:12,550 --> 01:09:14,150
Guys, guys, go easy,
he's just a baby.

858
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:16,520
Soldier,
I give the orders here.

859
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:25,700
It's his bedtime.

860
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:29,970
<i>This attraction is now closed.</i>

861
01:09:37,150 --> 01:09:38,740
Dad?

862
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:39,880
Uh-huh.

863
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:42,520
It's Mrs. Jumbo.

864
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:50,520
Come on,
I want to see Dumbo!

865
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:51,990
I want to see Dumbo!

866
01:09:51,990 --> 01:09:52,920
I want my money back!

867
01:09:52,930 --> 01:09:54,090
I don't understand.

868
01:09:54,090 --> 01:09:56,530
The elephant flies.
You saw it.

869
01:09:56,530 --> 01:09:58,130
I saw a vanishing act.

870
01:09:58,130 --> 01:10:01,730
I'm not investing one cent
until I can see this works.

871
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:04,040
You can't control
your animal.

872
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:06,170
You give me a little time,
I can fix this.

873
01:10:06,170 --> 01:10:09,680
Whatever! Till then,
the bank is closed.

874
01:10:14,150 --> 01:10:15,450
What happened up there?

875
01:10:15,450 --> 01:10:16,680
You lost control
of the animal.

876
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:17,680
You're the animal.

877
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:19,020
Where was my net?

878
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:21,490
Nets are for rehearsal.
This is the show.

879
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:26,560
Training?
You call that training?

880
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:29,060
Now, hold on, Mr. Vandevere,
we know why he flew away.

881
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:31,060
He recognized
that other elephant's call.

882
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:33,160
The one on Nightmare Island.
It's his momma!

883
01:10:33,170 --> 01:10:34,930
It's true.
It's her.

884
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:36,230
She was sold from our
circus two months ago.

885
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:37,770
Every child
knows its mother.

886
01:10:37,770 --> 01:10:40,240
And they say
elephants never forget.

887
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:42,510
They can be
together now.

888
01:10:42,510 --> 01:10:44,210
Why are there children
in my office?

889
01:10:44,210 --> 01:10:48,150
Mr. Vandevere, please,
all Dumbo wants is his momma.

890
01:10:48,150 --> 01:10:49,550
Just reunite them,

891
01:10:49,550 --> 01:10:50,980
and he'll do
whatever you want.

892
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:54,120
No, he'll do
whatever she wants.

893
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:55,690
You think
I'd have bought her

894
01:10:55,690 --> 01:10:58,160
if I thought she was
related to him? Hmm?

895
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:00,690
Doesn't help me at all.

896
01:11:05,130 --> 01:11:06,770
You wanna know
the most important thing

897
01:11:06,770 --> 01:11:08,100
about growing up?

898
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:13,970
You've got to learn
to go it alone.

899
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:19,680
Get rid of the mother.
You know where to take her.

900
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:21,080
And treat yourself
to some new boots.

901
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:23,450
But, sir,
you can't just kill her.

902
01:11:23,950 --> 01:11:25,120
Why not?

903
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:26,580
Mr. Vandevere.

904
01:11:26,590 --> 01:11:28,850
Wait!
Don't separate 'em, please.

905
01:11:28,850 --> 01:11:30,890
Don't do that to my kids.

906
01:11:30,890 --> 01:11:33,260
You know, Holt,
when my father left us,

907
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:34,890
it was a blessing really.

908
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:37,900
Because I had to learn
how to fend for myself.

909
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:40,300
Maybe that's what
your children need.

910
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:41,800
Don't tell me
what my children need.

911
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,240
Best take a step back,
Elephant Man.

912
01:11:45,570 --> 01:11:47,170
Darling...

913
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:51,580
Dumbo and his mom
need a little alone time.

914
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:53,840
So, Mommy's going to
take a little trip...

915
01:11:53,850 --> 01:11:55,920
so that Dumbo
won't be distracted.

916
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:01,120
Milly! Milly!

917
01:12:14,130 --> 01:12:15,170
Colette?

918
01:12:16,970 --> 01:12:18,240
I have rehearsal.

919
01:12:19,910 --> 01:12:20,970
Max.

920
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:27,810
<i>Nightmare Island.</i>

921
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:29,610
Milly?

922
01:12:29,620 --> 01:12:31,250
<i>Home of the most dangerous
beasts in the world.</i>

923
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:32,920
Sir, park's closing.

924
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:41,160
Milly!

925
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:46,170
Milly!

926
01:12:51,070 --> 01:12:53,110
Did you find her?

927
01:12:53,910 --> 01:12:54,910
No.

928
01:12:58,180 --> 01:13:02,010
Well, her momma always knew
what to say. No matter what.

929
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:04,180
She always knew.

930
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:07,750
Your children don't need you
to be perfect.

931
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:09,960
They just need you
to believe in them.

932
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:13,090
That simple, huh?

933
01:13:19,370 --> 01:13:22,630
All right, well,
I'm gonna keep looking.

934
01:13:43,790 --> 01:13:46,420
That's my daughter
all right.

935
01:13:46,430 --> 01:13:49,590
The only girl I know who
runs away to go to school.

936
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:52,400
It's our fault.

937
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,900
Bet Dumbo wishes
he never met us.

938
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:57,430
Ah, you showed him
he could fly.

939
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:00,270
You think
he'd ever trade that?

940
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:02,270
He would to have
his mom back.

941
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:09,210
I miss Momma.

942
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:12,850
Yeah, so do I.

943
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:19,920
There's something
I want to show you.

944
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,160
<i>With advances in both</i>

945
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:23,060
<i>engineering and medicine...</i>

946
01:14:23,060 --> 01:14:25,460
<i>the human and the mechanical
will soon be combined...</i>

947
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:28,930
<i>to assist ordinary families,
workers and veterans.</i>

948
01:14:28,930 --> 01:14:31,070
<i>All kinds
of technological marvels</i>

949
01:14:31,070 --> 01:14:33,140
<i>await us in the 20th century.</i>

950
01:14:34,410 --> 01:14:36,740
You're gonna do
great things.

951
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:38,980
I know it.

952
01:14:49,850 --> 01:14:51,250
Whoa, whoa. What's this?

953
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:52,890
Oh, give me a break.

954
01:14:52,890 --> 01:14:55,760
I gotta teach you
how to read English, too?

955
01:15:00,930 --> 01:15:03,930
Oh, Max, hello!

956
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:06,000
Good, you brought
the paperwork.

957
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,970
Max...

958
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:10,770
I was reviewing
your troupe...

959
01:15:10,780 --> 01:15:12,480
and to be honest with you...

960
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:15,140
they're really pale imitations
from the acts we already have.

961
01:15:15,150 --> 01:15:17,010
So I was thinking,
I don't know,

962
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:18,810
a month's severance?
Seems fair.

963
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:20,120
<i>Capisce?</i>

964
01:15:21,490 --> 01:15:23,390
I thought you promised to...

965
01:15:23,390 --> 01:15:26,290
Max, the contract says
that I'd hire them.

966
01:15:26,290 --> 01:15:28,320
It never stipulated
for how long.

967
01:15:28,330 --> 01:15:31,430
So, get your little band of
low-rent freaks out of here.

968
01:15:31,430 --> 01:15:35,000
But they're my troupe.
They're countin' on me.

969
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,470
Okay, let's have a heart.

970
01:15:37,470 --> 01:15:39,340
Why don't you tell them?

971
01:15:51,050 --> 01:15:54,320
'Bout time, boss.
So, when do we start?

972
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:07,100
What's going on, guys?

973
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:09,060
Vandevere's fired them all.

974
01:16:09,070 --> 01:16:11,200
They're to leave by tomorrow.

975
01:16:23,950 --> 01:16:26,920
Goodbye, little friend.

976
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:28,390
Goodbye.

977
01:16:30,590 --> 01:16:33,460
We wanted to see him
one last time.

978
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:37,130
One last time
to see him fly.

979
01:16:37,130 --> 01:16:39,460
I don't think
he wants to anymore.

980
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:41,400
Oh, no. But he must.

981
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:44,170
He cannot lose
Mrs. Jumbo again!

982
01:16:44,170 --> 01:16:47,000
Uh, I'm afraid
it's rather worse than that.

983
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:49,270
Mr. Sotheby?

984
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:52,210
I've come
to clear my conscience.

985
01:16:52,210 --> 01:16:55,010
I resigned my position as soon
as I heard him give the order.

986
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:57,380
What order?

987
01:16:57,380 --> 01:17:00,450
Mrs. Jumbo will be gone
by tomorrow night.

988
01:17:00,450 --> 01:17:02,290
And she's not
meant to survive.

989
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:20,640
This "Dreamland"
doesn't deserve him.

990
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:22,470
No circus does.

991
01:17:34,450 --> 01:17:38,890
Well, who's gonna be
willing to help me?

992
01:17:41,190 --> 01:17:43,030
Set Dumbo
and his momma free.

993
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:13,920
<i>Welcome to the Colosseum,</i>

994
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:16,630
<i>where the impossible
is possible.</i>

995
01:18:18,990 --> 01:18:21,660
Okay.
Second time's the charm.

996
01:18:21,670 --> 01:18:25,230
Let's see if Dream Daddy's
worked out the kinks.

997
01:18:25,230 --> 01:18:26,600
<i>Here to pick up the elephant</i>

998
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:28,400
- <i>from Nightmare Island?</i>
- Confirmed.

999
01:18:28,410 --> 01:18:30,040
Unlock the back gates.

1000
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:55,660
Dumbo in position!

1001
01:18:55,670 --> 01:18:57,500
Soon as he flies,
you run back to his tent

1002
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:59,100
and I'll find you there.

1003
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:00,430
All right, Big D.

1004
01:19:01,740 --> 01:19:04,570
It's all up to you now.

1005
01:19:04,570 --> 01:19:07,010
Come on, Holt!

1006
01:19:16,990 --> 01:19:18,350
To hell with it.

1007
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:25,130
Ready for positions.

1008
01:19:25,130 --> 01:19:27,390
We could have used
a little rehearsal.

1009
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:29,060
Rehearsal?

1010
01:19:29,060 --> 01:19:31,370
Think we got a rehearsal
at the Battle of the Argonne?

1011
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,300
You sure you can do this?

1012
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:36,140
I fly elephants
all the time.

1013
01:19:37,270 --> 01:19:39,770
Are you sure
you can do this?

1014
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:41,640
With one hand
tied behind my back.

1015
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:57,060
Wait. What's that?

1016
01:19:58,430 --> 01:19:59,430
Ma'am?

1017
01:20:01,230 --> 01:20:03,230
Ma'am?

1018
01:20:03,230 --> 01:20:05,300
Sorry, ma'am,
attraction's closed.

1019
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:08,540
My dream...
to be a mermaid...

1020
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:11,070
and now
they've taken it away.

1021
01:20:11,070 --> 01:20:13,540
And yet I hear
the water singing.

1022
01:20:13,540 --> 01:20:14,780
I hear them
beckoning me home.

1023
01:20:14,780 --> 01:20:16,710
Lady, just be careful,
okay?

1024
01:20:16,710 --> 01:20:18,110
Return me
to the vast abyss!

1025
01:20:18,110 --> 01:20:19,550
Let's go.

1026
01:20:19,550 --> 01:20:21,980
- My destiny, the sea!
- Okay.

1027
01:21:11,370 --> 01:21:12,630
We've lost power!

1028
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:14,170
Even the cages?

1029
01:21:14,170 --> 01:21:17,370
But the animals...

1030
01:21:17,370 --> 01:21:19,710
Find the breakers.
Get the lights back on!

1031
01:21:19,710 --> 01:21:21,540
And make sure
those cages are locked.

1032
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:41,560
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1033
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:43,560
<i>boys and girls.</i>

1034
01:21:43,570 --> 01:21:47,230
<i>Making his second
Dreamland debut.</i>

1035
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:49,900
<i>Let's get ready for Dumbo!</i>

1036
01:22:49,930 --> 01:22:50,800
Hey!

1037
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:01,170
It's a trick!
Get back to the...

1038
01:23:16,490 --> 01:23:20,990
<i>And once again, our very own
Queen of the Heavens!</i>

1039
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:43,950
You.

1040
01:23:43,950 --> 01:23:46,790
Where is
your circus of freaks?

1041
01:23:48,660 --> 01:23:50,020
What's going on?

1042
01:23:50,020 --> 01:23:52,520
The elephant's
mother is gone!

1043
01:23:52,530 --> 01:23:55,460
His troupe's behind it!

1044
01:23:55,460 --> 01:23:58,000
Alert the tower
and secure the gates.

1045
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,600
Don't let them get out.

1046
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:02,970
But why would they
only take the one?

1047
01:24:04,470 --> 01:24:07,510
Keep your eye on Farrier
and those kids.

1048
01:24:07,510 --> 01:24:09,210
You! Come with us.

1049
01:24:23,390 --> 01:24:24,690
There they are!

1050
01:24:26,730 --> 01:24:27,790
Hey!

1051
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:39,370
Hey, you!

1052
01:24:39,370 --> 01:24:40,840
What are you
doing up there?

1053
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:42,640
That's private property.

1054
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:44,540
Come on! Get down here!

1055
01:24:44,540 --> 01:24:45,780
Now!

1056
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:48,980
Hey, I'm Max Medici,
Vandevere's partner.

1057
01:24:48,980 --> 01:24:51,550
He's just a maintenance man
fixing a light!

1058
01:24:51,550 --> 01:24:52,850
Get back to your posts!

1059
01:24:52,850 --> 01:24:54,720
Yes, sir, Mr. Medici.

1060
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:11,700
Let's try this again.

1061
01:25:11,710 --> 01:25:13,010
You and me.

1062
01:25:28,690 --> 01:25:29,950
Hey, the kids?

1063
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:31,120
Where are the kids?

1064
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:32,560
Hey, have you
seen the kids?

1065
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:36,660
Dumbo,
Prince of the Elephants!

1066
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:39,670
I command you
to fly with me.

1067
01:25:54,780 --> 01:25:57,020
Dumbo, please fly.

1068
01:25:58,080 --> 01:25:59,790
Do it for your momma.

1069
01:26:54,870 --> 01:26:55,980
Where's your father?

1070
01:27:09,490 --> 01:27:11,020
Dumbo!

1071
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:25,400
Hey! Get those kids!

1072
01:27:28,540 --> 01:27:30,140
Dumbo!

1073
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:03,780
Come on.

1074
01:28:04,940 --> 01:28:06,080
There!

1075
01:28:23,660 --> 01:28:24,730
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

1076
01:28:27,030 --> 01:28:28,570
Just passing through!

1077
01:28:29,900 --> 01:28:31,540
Hey! You can't do that!

1078
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:35,970
Get the elephant!

1079
01:28:35,970 --> 01:28:37,770
You get the elephant!

1080
01:28:59,060 --> 01:29:02,230
Don't worry.
Dad'll be here soon.

1081
01:29:02,230 --> 01:29:03,800
Where's the elephant?

1082
01:29:10,170 --> 01:29:11,940
Why are you
just standing there?

1083
01:29:11,940 --> 01:29:13,240
Get to the tower!

1084
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:15,580
Electricity's failing!
There's no elevators!

1085
01:29:15,580 --> 01:29:19,220
When I last checked,
they invented stairs.

1086
01:29:19,220 --> 01:29:20,920
<i>We seem to be experiencing</i>

1087
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:22,850
<i>some technical difficulties.</i>

1088
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:39,870
What happened to my power?

1089
01:29:39,870 --> 01:29:42,710
What power, <i>mon cheri?</i>

1090
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:44,210
You ungrateful...

1091
01:29:44,210 --> 01:29:48,080
You were nothing before
I made you my... Uh...

1092
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:51,120
I believe the word
is "queen."

1093
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:54,020
I need lights!

1094
01:29:57,020 --> 01:29:58,850
Mr. Vandevere, wait!

1095
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:00,790
We have to reset the mains,
or you could cause a surge!

1096
01:30:00,790 --> 01:30:01,990
Right now it's impossible!

1097
01:30:01,990 --> 01:30:04,300
Nothing's impossible!

1098
01:30:05,930 --> 01:30:07,800
Mr. Vandevere!

1099
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:15,070
Mr. Vandevere, stop!

1100
01:30:40,830 --> 01:30:42,370
Milly! Joe!

1101
01:30:51,170 --> 01:30:53,010
Come on. Go!
Come on!

1102
01:31:19,700 --> 01:31:21,140
Get everyone out!

1103
01:31:21,140 --> 01:31:23,170
Evacuate the park!

1104
01:31:27,210 --> 01:31:28,940
Milly! Joe!

1105
01:31:42,090 --> 01:31:43,260
Hey!

1106
01:31:49,230 --> 01:31:51,270
Where is the elephant?

1107
01:31:51,270 --> 01:31:53,270
Let her go!

1108
01:32:10,050 --> 01:32:11,220
Come on!

1109
01:32:11,220 --> 01:32:12,450
Milly! Joe!

1110
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:14,220
Dad!

1111
01:32:14,220 --> 01:32:15,490
- You all right? All right?
- We're fine.

1112
01:32:15,490 --> 01:32:17,190
Okay, come on.
All right, cover your faces.

1113
01:32:17,190 --> 01:32:18,930
Give me your hand!
Come on!

1114
01:32:18,930 --> 01:32:20,060
Back!

1115
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:23,470
Stay close.

1116
01:32:32,940 --> 01:32:34,240
Come on, everybody.

1117
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:36,940
Let's get to the seaport!
Now!

1118
01:32:36,950 --> 01:32:39,010
- Where are the Farriers?
- They must still be inside.

1119
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:12,780
Dad!

1120
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:14,950
It's okay, Joe.

1121
01:33:16,450 --> 01:33:17,520
Come here. Come here.

1122
01:33:20,460 --> 01:33:21,420
Dumbo!

1123
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:30,570
Dumbo!

1124
01:33:30,570 --> 01:33:32,530
Come on!

1125
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:35,400
- Go! Go! Go! Go!
- Jump!

1126
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:36,970
Come on. Come on.

1127
01:33:44,550 --> 01:33:46,350
- All right, let's go.
- Stay close, come on.

1128
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:50,580
Okay. Go! Go! Go!

1129
01:33:50,590 --> 01:33:52,990
Come on!

1130
01:33:52,990 --> 01:33:55,160
- Dumbo!
- Come on!

1131
01:33:55,160 --> 01:33:56,560
Dumbo! What's wrong?

1132
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:58,390
Guys! Milly! Joe!
Come on!

1133
01:33:58,390 --> 01:34:00,030
Dumbo, let's go!

1134
01:34:04,030 --> 01:34:05,130
Go!

1135
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:11,870
Dumbo!

1136
01:34:11,870 --> 01:34:13,510
Get him!

1137
01:34:13,510 --> 01:34:16,040
He's seen us.
Dumbo, you gotta go.

1138
01:34:16,050 --> 01:34:17,480
They're comin' for you.
You gotta go, Dumbo.

1139
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:18,580
He lost the feather.

1140
01:34:18,580 --> 01:34:20,050
Feather doesn't do nothin'.

1141
01:34:20,050 --> 01:34:22,020
Dumbo, you don't need
the feather to fly.

1142
01:34:22,020 --> 01:34:23,580
Dad, they're coming!

1143
01:34:23,590 --> 01:34:25,950
Stand back! Stand back!

1144
01:34:25,950 --> 01:34:26,990
Out of my way!

1145
01:34:29,220 --> 01:34:31,290
Dumbo, remember this?

1146
01:34:31,290 --> 01:34:33,290
From my momma?

1147
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:38,170
I can unlock any door.
And you can, too.

1148
01:34:38,170 --> 01:34:39,930
But I don't need
this key to do it.

1149
01:34:39,930 --> 01:34:41,170
And you don't need
the feather.

1150
01:34:42,370 --> 01:34:43,370
Come on.

1151
01:34:58,650 --> 01:34:59,920
Dad!

1152
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:01,020
Gotta go. Come on!

1153
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:04,360
What are you doing?

1154
01:35:04,360 --> 01:35:06,090
There ain't room
for the three of us.

1155
01:35:06,090 --> 01:35:07,460
You get him to the seaport
and I'll see you there.

1156
01:35:07,460 --> 01:35:08,860
Go on, Big D.

1157
01:35:15,140 --> 01:35:16,340
Grab 'em!

1158
01:35:16,340 --> 01:35:17,340
Hey!

1159
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:25,480
Hey!

1160
01:35:27,150 --> 01:35:29,180
That's my elephant!

1161
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:44,530
They're safe.

1162
01:35:44,530 --> 01:35:46,130
Come on, let's go!

1163
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,500
Hey! Get back here!

1164
01:35:53,740 --> 01:35:55,540
You freak!
What have you done?

1165
01:35:55,540 --> 01:35:57,380
What they pay me for,
mister.

1166
01:35:57,380 --> 01:35:58,980
Put on a hell of a show.

1167
01:36:02,220 --> 01:36:04,080
Hey! Him!

1168
01:36:04,090 --> 01:36:05,990
Right there, arrest that man.
He stole my elephant.

1169
01:36:05,990 --> 01:36:08,320
Hey, we had a contract,
Medici!

1170
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:11,360
I'm no expert, but I think
you got bigger problems here.

1171
01:36:23,270 --> 01:36:25,370
Wow. This is a disaster.

1172
01:36:26,540 --> 01:36:28,170
Come on,
I'll buy you a hot dog.

1173
01:36:28,180 --> 01:36:30,110
Sounds good, J.G.

1174
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:12,220
Last call for cargo!

1175
01:37:12,220 --> 01:37:14,820
All aboard!

1176
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:37,340
Colette!

1177
01:37:45,420 --> 01:37:47,120
Where's your father?

1178
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:49,290
Don't worry.
He'll be here.

1179
01:37:55,460 --> 01:37:56,830
Dad!

1180
01:37:56,830 --> 01:37:58,700
I knew you could ride.

1181
01:38:05,110 --> 01:38:07,210
- Pramesh, we have to go.
- Please, hurry.

1182
01:38:08,510 --> 01:38:11,040
Hurry! Come on! Hurry!

1183
01:38:12,150 --> 01:38:13,280
Come.

1184
01:38:14,180 --> 01:38:15,650
Let's go home.

1185
01:38:31,570 --> 01:38:33,600
Hey!

1186
01:38:55,490 --> 01:38:57,520
Well, get out of here,
you little troublemaker.

1187
01:39:00,260 --> 01:39:01,290
Go on.

1188
01:39:41,370 --> 01:39:43,270
Ladies and gentlemen...

1189
01:39:43,270 --> 01:39:47,940
introducing our world-famous
flying elephant.

01:39:55,310 --> 01:39:58,680
Welcome to

no wild animals

1192

shall be held in captivity.

1193
