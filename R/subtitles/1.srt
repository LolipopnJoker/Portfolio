1
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:04,000
" FarangSiam thanks you.
Have Fun! "

2
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,920
This will begin to make things right.

3
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,830
I've traveled too far and seen too much

4
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,890
to ignore the despair in the galaxy.

5
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,850
Without the Jedi, there can be
no balance in the Force.

6
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,230
Well, because of you,
now we have a chance.

7
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,160
The General's been after this
for a long time.

8
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,970
Oh, the General?

9
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,440
To me, she is royalty.

10
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,430
Well, she certainly is that.

11
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,450
We got company.

12
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,050
You have to hide.

13
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,590
You have to leave.

14
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,720
Go.

15
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:21,420
Come on, BB-8, hurry!

16
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,790
" Blast that X-wing! "

17
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,060
Over there! Over there!

18
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,190
I see them.

19
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:15,750
You take this.

20
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,810
It's safer with you than it is with me.

21
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,770
You get as far away from here as you can.

22
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,650
Do you hear me?

23
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,150
I'll come back for you.

24
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,190
It will be all right.

25
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,540
" Keep moving! "

26
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,050
" Stay here. "

27
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:57,320
" Look how old you've become. "

28
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,950
Something far worse has happened to you.

29
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,750
" You know what I've come for. "

30
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,020
I know where you come from.

31
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,080
Before you called yourself Kylo Ren.

32
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:12,170
" The map to Skywalker.
We know you found it. "

33
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,090
" And now you're going
to give it to the First Order. "

34
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,660
The First Order rose from the dark side.

35
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,760
You did not.

36
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,430
" I'll show you the dark side. "

37
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,750
You may try.

38
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:29,860
But you cannot deny
the truth that is your family.

39
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:31,630
" You're so right. "

40
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,980
So, who talks first?
You talk first? I talk first?

41
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,020
" The old man gave it to you. "

42
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,100
It's just very hard
to understand you with all the...

43
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:14,721
" - Search him. "
- ...apparatus.

44
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,400
- Nothing, sir.
" - Put him on board. "

45
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:29,040
" Sir, the villagers? "

46
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,830
" Kill them all. "

47
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,920
" On my command. "

48
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,240
" Fire. "

49
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,340
Please, no!

50
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,620
" Nothing here. Go ahead! "

51
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,730
All right.

52
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:53,830
All right!

53
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,440
" FN-2187. "

54
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,610
" Submit your blaster for inspection. "

55
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,530
Yes, Captain.

56
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,780
" And who gave you permission
to remove that helmet? "

57
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,430
I'm sorry, Captain.

58
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,620
" Report to my division at once. "

59
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,570
What you brought me today is worth...

60
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,370
hmm...

61
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,410
one quarter portion.

62
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:28,070
Shh.

63
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,410
That's just Teedo. Wants you for parts.

64
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,700
He has no respect for anyone.

65
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,500
Your antenna's bent.

66
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,300
Where do you come from?

67
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,870
Classified, really?

68
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,270
Me too. Big secret.

69
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:01,270
Niima Outpost is that way.
Stay off Kelvin Ridge.

70
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,280
Keep away from
the Sinking Fields in the north.

71
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,820
You'll drown in the sand.

72
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:13,030
Don't follow me. Town is that way.

73
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,250
No!

74
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,260
In the morning, you go.

75
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,190
You're welcome.

76
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:57,990
" I had no idea we had the best pilot
in the Resistance on board. "

77
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,410
" Comfortable? "

78
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Not really.

79
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,750
" I'm impressed. "

80
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:13,550
" No one has been able to get out of you
what you did with the map. "

81
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:16,390
You might want to rethink your technique.

82
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,200
" Where is it? "

83
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,870
The Resistance...
will not be intimidated by you.

84
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,830
" Where... is it? "

85
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,540
" It's in a droid. A BB unit. "

86
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,080
Well, then, if it's on Jakku,
we'll soon have it.

87
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,850
" I leave that to you. "

88
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:08,670
Don't give up hope.
He still might show up.

89
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,880
Whoever it is you're waiting for.

90
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,440
Classified.

91
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,190
I know all about waiting.

92
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,240
For my family.

93
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:21,660
They'll be back. One day.

94
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:23,450
Come on.

95
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:29,620
" These five pieces are worth... "

96
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,580
Let me see here... hmm...

97
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,650
one half portion.

98
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,460
Last week they were a half portion each.

99
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,260
What about the droid?

100
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,140
What about him?

101
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,430
I'll pay for him.

102
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,610
Sixty portions.

103
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,620
Actually...

104
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,540
The droid's not for sale.

105
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:13,880
Come on.

106
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,550
Follow the girl and get that droid.

107
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,850
" Ren wants the prisoner. "

108
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,360
" Turn here. "

109
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,300
" Listen carefully. "

110
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,640
" If you do exactly as I say,
I can get you out of here. "

111
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,740
What?

112
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,060
This is a rescue. I'm helping you escape.

113
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,890
Can you fly a TIE fighter?

114
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,060
You're with the Resistance?

115
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,060
What? No, no, no. I'm breaking you out.

116
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,160
- Can you fly a TIE fighter?
- I can fly anything.

117
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,500
Why? Why are you helping me?

118
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,590
Because it's the right thing to do.

119
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,550
You need a pilot.

120
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,010
I need a pilot.

121
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,590
We're gonna do this.

122
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:06,930
Yeah?

123
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,420
" Okay. Stay calm. Stay calm. "

124
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,020
- I am calm.
" - I'm talking to myself. "

125
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,520
" Not yet. "

126
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,110
" Okay, go. This way. "

127
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,430
I've always wanted to fly
one of these things.

128
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,600
- Can you shoot?
- Blasters, I can.

129
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,020
Okay, same principle.

130
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:38,010
Use the toggle on the left to switch
between missiles, cannons and mag pulse.

131
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,440
Use the sight on the right to aim.

132
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,670
- Triggers to fire.
- This is very complicated.

133
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,300
I can fix this.

134
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,120
We have an unsanctioned
departure from bay two.

135
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,980
Alert General Hux. And stop that fighter.

136
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:22,920
- Fourteen failed. Eighteen...
- I got it.

137
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,380
This thing really moves.

138
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:35,140
We gotta take out as many of
these cannons as we can...

139
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,530
or we're not gonna get very far.

140
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,240
- All right.
- I'm gonna get us in position.

141
00:21:38,245 --> 00:21:39,245
Just stay sharp.

142
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,710
Up ahead! Up ahead! You see it?

143
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:44,840
I got us dead center.

144
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,340
- It's a clean shot.
- Okay, got it.

145
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,230
- Yeah!
- Yes!

146
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:57,390
Did you see that?

147
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,120
- Did you see that?
- I saw it!

148
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,900
Hey, what's your name?

149
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,240
FN-2187.

150
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,530
F... What?

151
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,460
That's the only name they ever gave me.

152
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:13,030
Well, I ain't using it. F-N, huh?

153
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:14,620
Finn. I'm gonna call you Finn.

154
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,330
- Is that all right?
- Finn.

155
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,080
Yeah. Finn, I like that.

156
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,330
- I like that.
- I'm Poe. Poe Dameron.

157
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:22,550
- Good to meet you, Poe.
- Good to meet you too, Finn.

158
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,360
Sir, they've taken out our turbo-lasers.

159
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,530
Use the ventral cannons.

160
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,760
Yes, sir. Bringing them online.

161
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,560
" General Hux,
is it the Resistance pilot? "

162
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:39,530
Yes, and he had help from one of our own.

163
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:43,540
We're checking the registers now
to identify which stormtrooper it was.

164
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:47,040
" The one from the village. FN-2187. "

165
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,460
Sir, ventral cannons hot.

166
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Fire.

167
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,140
One's coming toward you!
My right. Your left.

168
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,890
- Do you see it?
- Hold on.

169
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,020
I see him!

170
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,900
Nice shot!

171
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,320
Where are we going?

172
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:18,880
We're going back to Jakku. That's where.

173
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,410
No. We can't go back to Jakku.

174
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,870
We need to get out of this system.

175
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:23,770
I gotta get my droid
before the First Order does.

176
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,100
- What, a droid?
- That's right.

177
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,410
He's a BB unit, orange and white.
One of a kind.

178
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,620
I don't care what color he is!

179
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,860
No droid can be that important.

180
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,940
This one is, pal!

181
00:23:30,945 --> 00:23:33,145
We gotta get as far away from
the First Order as we can.

182
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,420
We go back to Jakku, we die.

183
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,930
That droid has a map
that leads straight to Luke Skywalker.

184
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,930
Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

185
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:45,100
" FN-2187 reported to my division... "

186
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,500
" was evaluated,
and sent to reconditioning. "

187
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,840
No prior signs of nonconformity?

188
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,840
" This was his first offense. "

189
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,050
General!

190
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:54,510
- They've been hit.
- Destroyed?

191
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:55,840
Disabled.

192
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,340
They were headed back to Jakku.

193
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,640
The fighter is projected to crash
in the Goazon badlands.

194
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,410
They were going back for the droid.

195
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:03,450
Send a squad to the wreckage.

196
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,970
Poe!

197
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,600
Poe!

198
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:31,480
Poe!

199
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,440
Poe! I got you.

200
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:39,610
Poe!

201
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:47,490
Poe!

202
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,910
" Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit. "

203
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,480
Capture the droid if we can,
but destroy it if we must.

204
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,370
" How capable are your soldiers,
General? "

205
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,940
I won't have you question my methods.

206
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,210
" They're obviously skilled
at committing high treason. "

207
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:25,010
" Perhaps Leader Snoke should
consider using a clone army. "

208
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,350
My men are exceptionally trained.

209
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,550
Programmed from birth.

210
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:29,830
" Then they should have
no problem retrieving the droid. "

211
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:30,930
" Unharmed. "

212
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:34,160
Careful, Ren, that your
personal interests...

213
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,720
not interfere with orders
from Leader Snoke.

214
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:39,290
" I want that map. "

215
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,770
" For your sake... "

216
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,100
" I suggest you get it. "

217
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,850
Water. Water.

218
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:50,970
No water.

219
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,570
Water.

220
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,520
Is there water?

221
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,300
What? Oi, get off him!

222
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,780
Hey!

223
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:55,220
They work for Unkar.

224
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,080
That guy that wanted you.

225
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,800
He must have really wanted you.

226
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,060
Who?

227
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,140
Him?

228
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,130
- What's your hurry, thief?
- What? Thief?

229
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,740
Ow!

230
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,110
- Hey, what?
- The jacket.

231
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,710
This droid says you stole it.

232
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,350
I've had a pretty messed up
day, all right?

233
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,880
So I'd appreciate it
if you stop accusing me of...

234
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:40,410
- Ow! Stop it!
- Where'd you get it?

235
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,850
It belongs to his master.

236
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,230
It belonged to Poe Dameron.
That was his name, right?

237
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,900
He was captured by the First Order.

238
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,610
I helped him escape, but our ship crashed.

239
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,860
Poe didn't make it.

240
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,870
I tried to help him. I'm sorry.

241
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:16,760
So you're with the Resistance?

242
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,720
Obviously.

243
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:24,160
Yes, I am.

244
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,560
I'm with the Resistance, yeah.

245
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,720
I am with the Resistance.

246
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:31,350
I've never met
a Resistance fighter before.

247
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,340
Well, this is what we look like.

248
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,970
Some of us. Others look different.

249
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,510
BB-8 says he's on a secret mission.

250
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,110
He has to get back to your base.

251
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,240
Apparently, he has a map that leads to
Luke Skywalker and everyone's after it.

252
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:46,580
Luke Skywalker?

253
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,620
I thought he was a myth.

254
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,910
What?

255
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,470
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

256
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,930
Come on, BB-8!

257
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,890
- Let go of me!
- Come on, we gotta move!

258
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:09,970
I know how to run
without you holding my hand!

259
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,340
BB-8, stay close!

260
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,440
This way.

261
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,440
" Call in the air strike. "

262
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,820
Come on!

263
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,520
They're shooting at both of us.

264
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,490
Yeah. They saw you with me. You're marked.

265
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,020
- Well, thanks for that.
- Hey!

266
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,040
I'm not the one who chased
you down with a stick.

267
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,730
Does anyone have blasters around here?

268
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,360
Are you okay?

269
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,340
Stop taking my hand!

270
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:01,650
Hey.

271
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:05,990
Are you okay?

272
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:08,990
Yeah.

273
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,780
Follow me.

274
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,950
- We can't outrun them!
- We might in that quadjumper!

275
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,380
Hey, we need a pilot!

276
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,050
We've got one.

277
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,180
You?

278
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,790
Uh, what about that ship?

279
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,350
That one's garbage!

280
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:40,310
The garbage will do.

281
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,910
Gunner position is down there!

282
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,790
You ever fly this thing?

283
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,050
No! This ship hasn't flown in years.

284
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:07,210
Great.

285
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,640
Whoa.

286
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,850
I can do this. I can do this.

287
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,890
I can do this. I can do this.

288
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,080
Hey!

289
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,960
That's mine!

290
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,130
Wait, stay low! Hey, stay low!

291
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,320
- What?
" - Stay low! "

292
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,630
It confuses their tracking.

293
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:54,930
BB-8, hold on!

294
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:56,470
I'm going low!

295
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,320
What are you doing back there?

296
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:17,620
Are you ever gonna fire back?

297
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,830
I'm working on it!
" Are the shields up? "

298
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:21,620
Not so easy without a co-pilot!

299
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:23,660
Try sitting in this thing.

300
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:39,300
We need cover, quick!

301
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:40,750
We're about to get some!

302
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:42,060
I hope.

303
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,250
Damn it!

304
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,010
Come on, come on!

305
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:27,100
- Nice shot!
- I'm getting pretty good at this.

306
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,820
Uh, the cannon's stuck
in forward position.

307
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,490
" I can't move it. You gotta lose him! "

308
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:50,870
- Get ready!
- Okay. For what?

309
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,800
Are we really doing this?

310
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,560
Oh, no.

311
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Whoo!

312
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:55,080
- Nice shooting.
- Now that was some flying.

313
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,380
- Thanks.
- How did you do that?

314
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,880
- I don't know.
- No one trained you?

315
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:00,020
I've flown some ships, but
I've never left the planet.

316
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,880
- Your last shot was dead-on.
- That was amazing.

317
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:03,910
- You got him with one blast!
- You set me up for it.

318
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,520
- It was perfect.
- That was pretty good.

319
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:08,950
You're okay. He's with the Resistance.

320
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:11,950
He's gonna get you home.

321
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,080
We both will.

322
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,040
I don't know your name.

323
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,550
Finn. What's yours?

324
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,130
I'm Rey.

325
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,020
Rey...

326
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,920
Help me with this. Quick!

327
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,390
Whoa, what's going on?

328
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:52,530
Sir... we were unable
to acquire the droid on Jakku.

329
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:58,830
It escaped capture aboard a stolen
Corellian YT model freighter.

330
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:02,440
" The droid stole a freighter? "

331
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,670
Not exactly, sir.

332
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,340
It had help.

333
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:14,560
We have no confirmation but we believe
FN-2187 may have helped in the escape.

334
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:33,910
" Anything else? "

335
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:38,200
The two were accompanied by a girl.

336
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,380
" What girl? "

337
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:49,160
It's the motivator.

338
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,840
Grab me a Harris wrench, check in there.

339
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,830
How bad is it?

340
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:53,590
If we wanna live, not good.

341
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,760
They're hunting for us now.

342
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:56,160
We've gotta get out of this system!

343
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:58,890
BB-8 said the location of the
Resistance base is "need to know".

344
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:00,500
If I'm taking you there, I need to know!

345
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,600
This?

346
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,480
You gotta tell us where your base is.

347
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,170
I don't speak that.

348
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:09,010
All right, between us...

349
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:10,570
I'm not with the Resistance, okay?

350
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:13,240
I'm just trying to get away
from the First Order.

351
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,970
But you tell us where the base is...

352
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:16,490
I'll get you there first. Deal?

353
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:20,080
- Droid, please!
- Pilex driver, hurry.

354
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,830
- So, where's your base?
- Go on, BB-8, tell her.

355
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,040
Please.

356
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:31,090
- The Ileenium system?
- Yeah, the Ileenium system.

357
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:32,970
That's the one. Get us there
as fast as you can.

358
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:34,590
I'll drop you two at Ponemah Terminal.

359
00:38:34,595 --> 00:38:35,865
I need the bonding tape, hurry!

360
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:36,840
What about you?

361
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:38,140
I gotta get back to Jakku.

362
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,200
Back to Jak...

363
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,900
Why does everyone wanna go back to Jakku?

364
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:43,490
- It's not that one. No. No.
- That place is...

365
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,420
The one I'm pointing to. No.

366
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,810
No. No!

367
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,270
If we don't patch it up...

368
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,220
the propulsion tank will overflow
and flood the ship with poisonous gas!

369
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,320
- This?
- Yes.

370
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:56,510
Hey, Rey, you're a pilot.

371
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:58,510
You can fly anywhere. Why go back?

372
00:38:58,610 --> 00:38:59,890
You got a family?

373
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:01,540
You got a boyfriend? A cute boyfriend?

374
00:39:01,545 --> 00:39:02,995
None of your business, that's why.

375
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,680
- That can't be good.
- No, it can't be.

376
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,490
Someone's locked on to us.

377
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:15,130
All controls are overridden.

378
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:23,640
Get off! Get off!

379
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:26,390
See anything?

380
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:28,850
Oh, no.

381
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,100
It's the First Order.

382
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,990
What do we do? There must be something.

383
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,430
- You said poisonous gas.
- I fixed that.

384
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:43,530
Can you unfix it?

385
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:50,330
Come on, BB-8.

386
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,960
I got him.

387
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:56,050
I'm okay.

388
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,420
BB-8, get off me!

389
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,050
Do you think this will work
on the stormtroopers?

390
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:05,600
Yeah. Their masks filter out
smoke, not toxins.

391
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,150
- Hurry.
- I'm hurrying.

392
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,640
Chewie...

393
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,000
we're home.

394
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:47,160
Where are the others?

395
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,830
- Where's the pilot?
" - I'm the pilot. "

396
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:50,370
You?

397
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:52,420
" No, it's true.
We're the only ones on board. "

398
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,940
" You can understand that thing? "

399
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,300
And "that thing" can
understand you, too, so watch it.

400
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,320
Come on out of there.

401
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,900
- Where'd you get this ship?
- Niima Outpost.

402
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:03,550
Jakku? That junkyard?

403
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:04,850
Thank you! Junkyard.

404
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:07,220
Told you we should have
double-checked the Western Reaches.

405
00:41:07,225 --> 00:41:08,855
Who had it? Ducain?

406
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:10,770
I stole it. From Unkar Plutt.

407
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:13,200
He stole it from the Irving Boys,
who stole it from Ducain.

408
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,480
Who stole it from me!

409
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,980
Well, you tell him that Han Solo...

410
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,460
just stole back the
Millennium Falcon for good.

411
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:22,460
This is the Millennium Falcon?
You're Han Solo?

412
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,630
I used to be.

413
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,740
Han Solo, the Rebellion general?

414
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,200
No, the smuggler.

415
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,120
Wasn't he a war hero?

416
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:34,540
This is the ship that made
the Kessel Run in 14 parsecs?

417
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,890
Twelve!

418
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,440
Fourteen.

419
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:54,950
Hey!

420
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:58,440
Some moof-milker
put a compressor on the ignition line.

421
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,610
Unkar Plutt did.

422
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:01,570
I thought it was a mistake, too.
Puts too much...

423
00:42:01,575 --> 00:42:03,865
...stress on the hyperdrive.

424
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,960
Chewie, throw them in a pod.

425
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,950
We'll drop them at the
nearest inhabited planet.

426
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:09,740
Wait, no.

427
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,250
- We need your help.
- My help?

428
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:15,270
This droid has to get to the
Resistance base as soon as possible.

429
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:18,350
He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker.

430
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:25,780
You are the Han Solo that
fought with the Rebellion.

431
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:32,870
You knew him.

432
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,310
Yeah. I knew him.

433
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:41,040
I knew Luke.

434
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:46,130
Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten loose.

435
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,800
Wait, what?

436
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:50,380
Did you just say Rathtars?

437
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:52,120
Hey!

438
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:54,760
You're not hauling Rathtars
on this freighter, are you?

439
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:57,500
I'm hauling Rathtars.

440
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,790
Oh, great. It's the Guavian Death Gang.

441
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:02,350
Must have tracked us from Nantoon.

442
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,260
What's a Rathtar?

443
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,840
They're big and they're dangerous.

444
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,470
You ever heard of the Trillia Massacre?

445
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:08,590
- No.
- Good.

446
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:10,550
I got three of them going to King Prana.

447
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:12,970
Three? How'd you get them on board?

448
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:14,780
I used to have a bigger crew.

449
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:20,270
Get below and stay there until I say so...

450
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:22,140
and don't even think about
taking the Falcon.

451
00:43:22,145 --> 00:43:23,125
What about BB-8?

452
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:24,930
He stays with me
until I get rid of the gang...

453
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,755
then you can have him back
and be on your way.

454
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,800
What about the Rathtars?
Where are you keeping them?

455
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,950
- There's one.
- What are you gonna do?

456
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:35,330
Same thing I always do.
Talk my way out of it.

457
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,930
Yes, I do. Every time.

458
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,180
Han Solo.

459
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,740
You're a dead man.

460
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:02,580
Bala-Tik. What's the problem?

461
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:05,460
The problem is we loaned you
50,000 for this job.

462
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:08,080
- Can you see them?
- No.

463
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:11,250
I heard you also borrowed
50,000 from Kanjiklub.

464
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,590
You know you can't trust
those little freaks.

465
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:16,660
How long we known each other?

466
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,830
They have blasters.

467
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:18,990
A lot of them.

468
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:22,290
Not long. We want our money back now.

469
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:24,380
You think hunting Rathtars is cheap?

470
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,630
I spent that money.

471
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:28,150
Kanjiklub wants
their investment back, too.

472
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:30,550
I never made a deal with Kanjiklub!

473
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:32,510
Tell that to Kanjiklub.

474
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:44,020
Tasu Leech.

475
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,120
Good to see you.

476
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,950
Boys, you're both gonna
get what I promised.

477
00:44:57,050 --> 00:44:58,410
Have I ever not delivered...

478
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:00,010
- for you before?
- Yeah.

479
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:07,310
- What was the second time?
- Your game is old.

480
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:09,940
There's no one in the galaxy
left for you to swindle.

481
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:13,590
That BB unit.

482
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:16,530
The First Order is looking
for one just like it.

483
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:21,320
And two fugitives.

484
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,330
First I've heard of it.

485
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:33,330
Wait, wait, wait.

486
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,780
If we close the blast doors in that
corridor we can trap both gangs!

487
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,420
We'll close the blast doors from here?

488
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:43,220
Resetting the fuses should do it.

489
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:52,960
I got a bad feeling about this.

490
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:55,190
- Oh, no.
- "Oh, no," what?

491
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:57,130
Wrong fuses.

492
00:45:57,230 --> 00:45:58,400
Kill them!

493
00:45:58,530 --> 00:45:59,730
- Whoa...
- And take the droid!

494
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:27,390
- This was a mistake!
- Huge!

495
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:41,610
What do they look like?

496
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:49,570
They look like that.

497
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:53,660
- This way.
- Are you sure?

498
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:56,750
No, no, no!

499
00:46:57,790 --> 00:46:59,170
Finn!

500
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:01,250
Finn!

501
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:03,420
Rey!

502
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:07,880
Get off! Get off!

503
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:15,640
- Rey!
- Finn!

504
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:17,940
Finn!

505
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,270
" Get off me! "

506
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:33,450
" Rey! "

507
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:39,370
Get off! Get off!

508
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:43,290
Finn!

509
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,300
- It had me! But the door...
- That was lucky.

510
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:52,640
I got the door. Cover us!

511
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,350
Chewie!

512
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:05,820
You okay?

513
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:07,990
Wow.

514
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,410
Come on! Come on!

515
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,140
Han.

516
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:19,500
You, close the door behind us.
You, take care of Chewie!

517
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:28,400
Hey, where are you going?

518
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,160
Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump, too.

519
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:32,170
If we don't prime that,
we're not going anywhere.

520
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:33,340
I hate that guy.

521
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:35,950
- And you could use a co-pilot.
- I got one, he's back there.

522
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:40,620
Watch the thrust. We're going
out of here at lightspeed.

523
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:42,400
From inside the hangar?
Is that even possible?

524
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:44,450
I never ask that question
till after I've done it.

525
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,030
This is not how I thought
this day was gonna go.

526
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:51,090
Angle the shield. Hang on back there.

527
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:52,360
No problem!

528
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:03,610
Come on, baby, don't let me down.

529
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,040
- What?
- Compressor.

530
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:19,660
Inform the First Order
that Han Solo has the droid they want.

531
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,770
And it's aboard the Millennium Falcon.

532
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:35,070
" The droid will soon be
delivered to the Resistance... "

533
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:40,080
leading them to the last Jedi.

534
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:45,040
If Skywalker returns...

535
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:49,580
the new Jedi will rise.

536
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:52,520
Supreme Leader,
I take full responsibility...

537
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:54,200
General!

538
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:59,090
Our strategy must now change.

539
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:01,260
The weapon. It is ready.

540
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:03,640
I believe the time has come to use it.

541
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,540
We shall destroy the government
that supports the Resistance...

542
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,340
the Republic.

543
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:11,650
Without their friends to protect them
the Resistance will be vulnerable.

544
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:14,800
And we will stop them
before they reach Skywalker.

545
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:16,150
Go.

546
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:18,350
Oversee preparations.

547
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:20,110
Yes, Supreme Leader.

548
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,450
There has been an awakening.

549
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,920
Have you felt it?

550
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:33,500
" Yes. "

551
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,500
There's something more.

552
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:42,220
The droid we seek is aboard
the Millennium Falcon.

553
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:45,870
In the hands of your father...

554
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:49,810
Han Solo.

555
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:54,810
" He means nothing to me. "

556
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:59,740
Even you, master of the Knights of Ren...

557
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:03,820
have never faced such a test.

558
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:07,660
" By the grace of your training,
I will not be seduced. "

559
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:10,620
We shall see.

560
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:15,040
We shall see.

561
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:25,340
- Electrical overload.
- I can fix that.

562
00:51:25,470 --> 00:51:26,720
Coolant's leaking.

563
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:30,790
- Try transferring auxiliary power...
- ...to the secondary tank.

564
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:32,430
I got it.

565
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,230
Chewie, come on!

566
00:51:35,850 --> 00:51:37,420
I need help with this giant hairy thing!

567
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:38,520
Stop moving!

568
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:42,360
Chewie!

569
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:44,200
You hurt Chewie,
you're gonna deal with me!

570
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,660
Hurt him? He almost killed me six times!

571
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:49,030
Which is fine!

572
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:52,660
This hyperdrive blows, there are gonna be
pieces of us in three different systems.

573
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,040
What'd you do?

574
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,000
I bypassed the compressor.

575
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:03,340
Huh.

576
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:07,890
Move, ball.

577
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:12,120
Ah, don't say that.

578
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:13,890
You did great. Just rest.

579
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:15,890
Good job, kid.

580
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:17,350
Thanks.

581
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,170
You're welcome.

582
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:26,820
So... fugitives, huh?

583
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:30,020
The First Order wants the map.

584
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,410
Finn is with the Resistance.

585
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:33,450
I'm just a scavenger.

586
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,500
Let's see what you got.

587
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:39,460
Go ahead.

588
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:50,740
This map's not complete.

589
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,350
It's just a piece.

590
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:57,460
Ever since Luke disappeared
people have been looking for him.

591
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,060
Why did he leave?

592
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:03,010
He was training a new generation of Jedi.

593
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:07,150
One boy, an apprentice,
turned against him, destroyed it all.

594
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:10,640
Luke felt responsible.

595
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:13,240
He just walked away from everything.

596
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:15,410
Do you know what happened to him?

597
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:17,950
A lot of rumors. Stories.

598
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,170
People that knew him best...

599
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:26,040
think he went looking
for the first Jedi temple.

600
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,110
The Jedi were real?

601
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:31,410
I used to wonder about that myself.

602
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:33,720
Thought it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo.

603
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,160
A magical power holding
together good and evil...

604
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:39,390
the dark side and the light.

605
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:42,940
Crazy thing is...

606
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:46,770
it's true.

607
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,940
The Force. The Jedi.

608
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:54,530
All of it.

609
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:59,100
It's all true.

610
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:04,500
No, you rest.

611
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:07,360
You want my help? You're getting it.

612
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:09,500
Gonna see an old friend.
She'll get your droid home.

613
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,130
This is our stop.

614
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,400
I didn't know there was this much green
in the whole galaxy.

615
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:02,560
Hey, Solo, I'm not sure what
we're walking into here...

616
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,170
Did you just call me Solo?

617
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:05,880
Sorry. Han. Mr. Solo.

618
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:07,040
You should know...

619
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:09,500
I'm a big deal in the Resistance.

620
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,940
Which puts a real target on my back.

621
00:55:12,070 --> 00:55:13,630
Are there any conspirators here?

622
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:15,610
Like, First Order sympathizers?

623
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:18,390
Listen, Big Deal.

624
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:20,390
You got another problem.

625
00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:22,660
Women always figure out the truth.

626
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,580
Always.

627
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:32,960
You might need this.

628
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:35,920
I think I can handle myself.

629
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:38,160
I know you do. That's why
I'm giving it to you.

630
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:39,260
Take it.

631
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:43,350
You know how to use one of those?

632
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:45,000
Yeah. You pull the trigger.

633
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:46,930
Little bit more to it than that.

634
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:49,100
You got a lot to learn.

635
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:51,770
You got a name?

636
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:53,690
Rey.

637
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,400
Rey.

638
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,680
I been thinking about bringing
on some more crew, Rey.

639
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:03,720
A second mate. Someone to help out.

640
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:07,120
Someone who can keep up with Chewie
and me appreciates the Falcon.

641
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,020
Are you offering me a job?

642
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,620
I wouldn't be nice to you.
Doesn't pay much.

643
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:13,580
You're offering me a job.

644
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:16,290
I'm thinking about it.

645
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,130
Well?

646
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:28,310
If you were, I'd be flattered.
But I have to get home.

647
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:30,730
Where, Jakku?

648
00:56:31,310 --> 00:56:33,100
I've already been away too long.

649
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:37,190
Chewie, check out the ship
as best you can.

650
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:43,820
That's too bad. Chewie kind of likes you.

651
00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:50,200
- Solo, why are we here again?
- To get your droid on a clean ship.

652
00:56:50,330 --> 00:56:51,270
Clean?

653
00:56:51,370 --> 00:56:54,250
You think it was luck
that Chewie and I found the Falcon?

654
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:58,880
If we can find it on our scanners
the First Order's not far behind.

655
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,780
Wanna get BB-8 to the Resistance?

656
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:03,720
Maz Kanata's our best bet.

657
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:06,080
We can trust her, right?

658
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:07,720
Relax, kid.

659
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,510
She's run this watering hole
for a thousand years.

660
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:14,750
Maz is a bit of an acquired taste,
so let me do the talking.

661
00:57:14,850 --> 00:57:16,590
And whatever you do, don't stare.

662
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:17,730
At what?

663
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:19,860
Any of it.

664
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,050
Han Solo!

665
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:48,470
Oh, boy.

666
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:49,760
Hey, Maz.

667
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,560
Where's my boyfriend?

668
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:57,670
Chewie's working on the Falcon.

669
00:57:57,770 --> 00:57:58,770
I like that Wookiee.

670
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,510
I assume you need something.

671
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:03,010
Desperately.

672
00:58:03,110 --> 00:58:04,110
Let's get to it.

673
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,120
" Forgive me. "

674
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:04,460
" I feel it again. "

675
00:59:08,130 --> 00:59:09,670
" The pull to the light. "

676
00:59:12,510 --> 00:59:15,010
" Supreme Leader senses it. "

677
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:17,470
" Show me again. "

678
00:59:17,970 --> 00:59:20,140
" The power of the darkness. "

679
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:24,020
" And I will let nothing stand
in our way. "

680
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:26,360
" Show me... "

681
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:29,860
" Grandfather... "

682
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:34,660
" and I will finish... "

683
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:36,160
" what you started. "

684
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,380
A map.

685
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,110
To Skywalker himself?

686
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:55,950
You are right back in the mess.

687
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:59,510
Maz, I need you to get this droid to Leia.

688
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:01,350
Hmm...

689
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:02,470
No.

690
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:07,850
You've been running away
from this fight for too long.

691
01:00:08,350 --> 01:00:09,350
Han.

692
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:13,530
Go home.

693
01:00:14,190 --> 01:00:15,470
Leia doesn't wanna see me.

694
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,780
Please, we came here for your help.

695
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:20,030
What fight?

696
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:23,270
The only fight.

697
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:25,520
Against the dark side.

698
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:29,170
Through the ages
I've seen evil take many forms.

699
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:32,450
The Sith. The Empire.

700
01:00:32,550 --> 01:00:35,880
Today, it is the First Order.

701
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:39,590
Their shadow is spreading
across the galaxy.

702
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,090
We must face them.

703
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:43,260
Fight them.

704
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:44,930
All of us.

705
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,230
There is no fight against the First Order.

706
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:48,350
Not one we can win.

707
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:50,800
Look around.

708
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:53,270
There's no chance we haven't
been recognized already.

709
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,610
I bet you the First Order
is on their way right...

710
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:57,900
What's this?

711
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:00,740
What are you doing?

712
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:06,950
Solo, what is she doing?

713
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,830
I don't know. But it ain't good.

714
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,770
If you live long enough...

715
01:01:10,870 --> 01:01:14,380
you see the same eyes in different people.

716
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:19,760
I'm looking at the eyes
of a man who wants to run.

717
01:01:22,630 --> 01:01:24,600
You don't know a thing about me.

718
01:01:25,930 --> 01:01:28,930
Where I'm from. What I've seen.

719
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:32,270
You don't know the First Order like I do.

720
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:35,380
They'll slaughter us.

721
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:37,610
We all need to run.

722
01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:39,780
Hmm.

723
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:47,080
You see those two?

724
01:01:47,790 --> 01:01:50,940
They'll trade work for transportation
to the Outer Rim.

725
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,250
There, you can disappear.

726
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:54,460
Finn?

727
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:57,880
Come with me.

728
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,950
What about BB-8? We're not done yet.

729
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:02,720
We have to get him back to your base.

730
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,140
I can't.

731
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:19,150
Keep it, kid.

732
01:02:29,410 --> 01:02:30,830
Who's the girl?

733
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:37,730
I was told you can get me
to the Outer Rim.

734
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:38,920
What are you doing?

735
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:41,670
Don't leave without me.

736
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:47,330
You can't just go. I won't let you.

737
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:48,490
I'm not who you think I am.

738
01:02:48,590 --> 01:02:49,860
Finn, what are you talking about?

739
01:02:49,870 --> 01:02:50,910
I'm not Resistance.

740
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:53,010
I'm not a hero.

741
01:02:56,270 --> 01:02:58,020
I'm a stormtrooper.

742
01:02:59,190 --> 01:03:02,110
Like all of them, I was taken
from a family I'll never know.

743
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:04,860
And raised to do one thing.

744
01:03:05,570 --> 01:03:08,700
But my first battle, I made a choice.

745
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:11,700
I wasn't gonna kill for them.

746
01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:15,290
So I ran. Right into you.

747
01:03:16,870 --> 01:03:18,960
And you looked at me like no one ever had.

748
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:24,170
I was ashamed of what I was.

749
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,720
But I'm done with the First Order.

750
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,630
I'm never going back.

751
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,470
Rey, come with me.

752
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:36,810
Don't go.

753
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:43,730
Take care of yourself.

754
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,190
Please.

755
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,980
" No! "

756
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:05,250
" No! "

757
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:21,430
" No! Come back! "

758
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,230
" No! "

759
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:42,120
" Come back! "

760
01:04:52,470 --> 01:04:54,300
" No! "

761
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:47,080
" No! "

762
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:48,730
" Its energy... "

763
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:54,570
" ...surrounds us...
- No! "

764
01:05:54,690 --> 01:05:57,030
" ...and binds us... "

765
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:05,980
" The Force will be... "

766
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:16,550
" No! "

767
01:06:16,670 --> 01:06:18,550
Come back!

768
01:06:18,670 --> 01:06:20,180
Quiet, girl.

769
01:06:21,050 --> 01:06:22,050
No!

770
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:27,640
" Rey? "

771
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:34,940
" These are your first steps. "

772
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:40,900
What was that?

773
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:44,870
I shouldn't have gone in there.

774
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:49,560
That lightsaber was Luke's.

775
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:51,460
And his father's before him.

776
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:55,210
And now, it calls to you.

777
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:56,750
I have to get back to Jakku.

778
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:59,090
Han told me.

779
01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:08,870
Dear child.

780
01:07:08,970 --> 01:07:11,000
I see your eyes.

781
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:14,090
You already know the truth.

782
01:07:14,190 --> 01:07:16,650
Whomever you're waiting for on Jakku...

783
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:19,940
they're never coming back.

784
01:07:25,990 --> 01:07:29,620
But... there's someone who still could.

785
01:07:32,330 --> 01:07:33,900
Luke.

786
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,670
The belonging you seek
is not behind you...

787
01:07:37,790 --> 01:07:39,460
it is ahead.

788
01:07:39,590 --> 01:07:43,130
I am no Jedi, but I know the Force.

789
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:47,340
It moves through and surrounds
every living thing.

790
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:50,850
Close your eyes.

791
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:54,140
Feel it.

792
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:57,520
The light...

793
01:07:57,650 --> 01:08:00,020
it's always been there.

794
01:08:00,150 --> 01:08:02,150
It will guide you.

795
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:06,320
The saber. Take it.

796
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:12,270
I'm never touching that thing again.

797
01:08:12,370 --> 01:08:13,870
I don't want any part of this.

798
01:08:17,330 --> 01:08:18,330
Hmm.

799
01:08:40,350 --> 01:08:43,860
" Today is the end of the Republic. "

800
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:51,360
" The end of a regime
that acquiesces to disorder. "

801
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:56,750
" At this very moment,
in a system far from here... "

802
01:08:56,870 --> 01:09:01,710
" the New Republic lies to the galaxy... "

803
01:09:01,830 --> 01:09:05,420
" while secretly
supporting the treachery... "

804
01:09:06,210 --> 01:09:09,530
" of the loathsome Resistance. "

805
01:09:09,630 --> 01:09:13,120
" This fierce machine
which you have built... "

806
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:15,060
" upon which we stand... "

807
01:09:15,180 --> 01:09:17,540
" will bring an end to the Senate! "

808
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:20,460
" To their cherished fleet! "

809
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:25,010
" All remaining systems
will bow to the First Order! "

810
01:09:25,110 --> 01:09:27,610
" And will remember this... "

811
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:32,780
" as the last day of the Republic! "

812
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:36,680
Confirm transfer to manual control.

813
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:38,330
Configure!

814
01:09:38,450 --> 01:09:39,910
" Fire! "

815
01:10:39,970 --> 01:10:42,640
No. What is it?

816
01:10:58,660 --> 01:10:59,820
It was the Republic.

817
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:02,620
The First Order, they've done it.

818
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,160
Where's Rey?

819
01:11:23,430 --> 01:11:25,680
What are you doing?

820
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:28,880
You have to go back.

821
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:30,100
I'm leaving.

822
01:11:30,850 --> 01:11:32,340
BB-8...

823
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:33,510
No, you can't.

824
01:11:33,610 --> 01:11:35,760
You have to go back, you're too important.

825
01:11:35,860 --> 01:11:37,030
They'll help you.

826
01:11:51,710 --> 01:11:53,000
I've had this for ages.

827
01:11:57,050 --> 01:11:58,380
Kept it locked away.

828
01:11:58,840 --> 01:11:59,840
Where'd you get that?

829
01:12:01,130 --> 01:12:04,220
A good question. For another time.

830
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:06,290
Take it.

831
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:07,890
Find your friend!

832
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:17,070
Those beasts.

833
01:12:17,190 --> 01:12:18,190
They're here.

834
01:12:42,090 --> 01:12:44,760
" FN-417, hold position. "

835
01:12:46,590 --> 01:12:48,260
Oh, safety.

836
01:13:13,950 --> 01:13:15,020
" Sir. "

837
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:16,640
" The droid was spotted heading west. "

838
01:13:16,650 --> 01:13:17,650
" With a girl. "

839
01:13:23,090 --> 01:13:25,530
You have to keep going. Stay out of sight.

840
01:13:25,630 --> 01:13:28,450
I'll try to fight them off.

841
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:29,800
I hope so, too.

842
01:13:42,230 --> 01:13:44,150
Come on, Chewie!

843
01:13:46,570 --> 01:13:48,550
Rey and BB-8! They need you!

844
01:13:48,650 --> 01:13:49,640
Now! Go!

845
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:52,060
I need a weapon!

846
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:53,620
You have one!

847
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,670
Hey, can I try that?

848
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:13,640
I like this thing.

849
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:20,900
" Traitor! "

850
01:15:05,650 --> 01:15:07,470
- You okay, Big Deal?
- Thanks.

851
01:15:07,570 --> 01:15:08,570
" Don't move. "

852
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:11,570
" TK-338, we have targets in custody. "

853
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:19,980
" We have incoming at 28. 6. "

854
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:22,080
" Move! Move! Move! "

855
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:26,070
" Scramble all squads, repeat,
scramble all squads! "

856
01:15:26,170 --> 01:15:28,110
" Head to higher cover and wait
for our position! "

857
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:32,260
It's the Resistance.

858
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:42,330
Go straight at them!
Don't let these dogs scare you!

859
01:15:42,430 --> 01:15:44,060
" - Copy that. "
- We're with you, Poe.

860
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:13,800
Quick!

861
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:44,080
Whoo! Yeah!

862
01:16:44,740 --> 01:16:46,580
That's one hell of a pilot!

863
01:16:46,750 --> 01:16:48,000
Whoo-hoo!

864
01:17:42,340 --> 01:17:44,390
" The girl I've heard so much about. "

865
01:17:56,650 --> 01:17:58,230
" The droid. "

866
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:02,190
" Where is it? "

867
01:18:07,410 --> 01:18:09,030
" Request air support. "

868
01:18:16,170 --> 01:18:17,540
" The map. "

869
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:21,660
" You've seen it. "

870
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:24,090
" Sir, Resistance fighters. "

871
01:18:25,050 --> 01:18:26,630
" We need more troops. "

872
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:28,600
" Pull the division out. "

873
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:31,770
" Forget the droid.
We have what we need. "

874
01:18:38,610 --> 01:18:39,900
" Pull back to tree line! "

875
01:18:55,290 --> 01:18:56,810
No!

876
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:01,960
No, no!

877
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:05,960
No! No!

878
01:19:07,630 --> 01:19:08,970
Rey!

879
01:19:27,990 --> 01:19:29,990
He took her. Did you see that?

880
01:19:30,820 --> 01:19:32,220
He took her. She's gone.

881
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:33,490
Yeah, I know.

882
01:19:42,830 --> 01:19:44,170
Let's go.

883
01:19:57,850 --> 01:20:00,350
Goodness! Han Solo!

884
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:02,650
It is I, C-3PO.

885
01:20:03,190 --> 01:20:06,320
You probably don't recognize me
because of the red arm.

886
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:08,340
Look who it is, did you see who...

887
01:20:10,150 --> 01:20:11,150
Uh...

888
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:12,700
Hmm.

889
01:20:12,820 --> 01:20:15,850
Excuse me, Prin... General. Sorry.

890
01:20:15,950 --> 01:20:18,270
Come along, BB-8, quickly.

891
01:20:18,370 --> 01:20:21,040
Yes, I must get my proper arm reinstalled.

892
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:24,710
You changed your hair.

893
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:28,460
Same jacket.

894
01:20:29,710 --> 01:20:31,510
No, new jacket.

895
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:45,480
I saw him.

896
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:49,570
Leia, I saw our son.

897
01:20:51,230 --> 01:20:52,530
He was here.

898
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:34,320
Hey!

899
01:21:38,910 --> 01:21:40,780
BB-8, my buddy.

900
01:21:40,910 --> 01:21:42,850
Oh, it's so good to see you.

901
01:21:42,950 --> 01:21:43,940
Finn saved you?

902
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:45,120
Where is he?

903
01:21:45,250 --> 01:21:46,450
Poe?

904
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Oh, no.

905
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:51,030
Poe Dameron, you're alive?

906
01:21:51,130 --> 01:21:53,280
- Buddy! So are you!
- What happened to you?

907
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:54,700
I got thrown from the crash.

908
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,700
I woke up at night.
No you. No ship. Nothing.

909
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,170
BB-8 says that you saved him.

910
01:21:58,300 --> 01:21:59,800
No, no, no. It wasn't just me.

911
01:21:59,930 --> 01:22:01,410
You completed my mission, Finn...

912
01:22:01,510 --> 01:22:02,510
That's my jacket.

913
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:05,040
- Oh...
- No, no, no.

914
01:22:05,140 --> 01:22:06,890
Keep it. It suits you.

915
01:22:07,770 --> 01:22:09,520
You're a good man, Finn.

916
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:12,400
Poe, I need your help.

917
01:22:13,940 --> 01:22:16,780
" PZ-4CO, report to communications. "

918
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:20,860
General Organa...

919
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:24,830
I'm sorry to interrupt. This is Finn.

920
01:22:24,950 --> 01:22:27,770
- He needs to talk to you.
- And I need to talk to him.

921
01:22:27,870 --> 01:22:29,650
That was incredibly brave what you did.

922
01:22:29,750 --> 01:22:32,330
Renouncing the First Order,
saving this man's life.

923
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:34,600
Thank you, ma'am. But a friend
of mine was taken prisoner.

924
01:22:34,610 --> 01:22:36,370
Han told me about the girl.

925
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:37,550
I'm sorry.

926
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:40,130
Finn's familiar with the weapon
that destroyed the Hosnian system.

927
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:41,140
He worked on the base.

928
01:22:41,300 --> 01:22:43,220
We're desperate for anything
you can tell us.

929
01:22:43,340 --> 01:22:44,680
That's where my friend was taken.

930
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:45,970
I've got to get there fast.

931
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:49,850
And I will do everything I can to help but
first you need to tell us all you know.

932
01:22:52,850 --> 01:22:54,560
That sounds very scary.

933
01:22:56,690 --> 01:22:58,820
You must be so brave.

934
01:23:01,650 --> 01:23:02,650
General...

935
01:23:02,780 --> 01:23:05,850
I regret to inform you,
but this map recovered from BB-8...

936
01:23:05,950 --> 01:23:07,430
is only partially complete.

937
01:23:07,530 --> 01:23:11,270
And even worse, it matches
no charted system on record.

938
01:23:11,370 --> 01:23:15,080
We simply do not have enough
information to locate Master Luke.

939
01:23:16,170 --> 01:23:19,250
Can't believe I was so foolish to think
I could find Luke and bring him home.

940
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:20,490
Leia.

941
01:23:20,590 --> 01:23:21,660
Don't do that.

942
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:22,950
Do what?

943
01:23:23,050 --> 01:23:24,180
Anything.

944
01:23:25,590 --> 01:23:27,470
Princesses.

945
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:29,120
I'm trying to be helpful.

946
01:23:30,310 --> 01:23:31,370
When did that ever help?

947
01:23:31,470 --> 01:23:33,180
And don't say the Death Star.

948
01:23:48,410 --> 01:23:49,410
BB-8.

949
01:23:49,530 --> 01:23:52,560
You're wasting your time.

950
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:55,750
It is very doubtful that R2 would have
the rest of the map in his backup data.

951
01:23:55,910 --> 01:23:58,020
I am afraid not.

952
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:02,170
R2-D2 has been in low-power mode
ever since Master Luke went away.

953
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:08,010
Sadly, he may never be his old self again.

954
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:11,350
Listen to me, will you?

955
01:24:12,350 --> 01:24:14,680
I know every time you...

956
01:24:16,890 --> 01:24:19,250
Every time you look at me
you're reminded of him.

957
01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:21,340
You think I want to forget him?

958
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:23,110
I want him back.

959
01:24:23,230 --> 01:24:25,320
There's nothing more we could have done.

960
01:24:27,070 --> 01:24:28,430
There's too much Vader in him.

961
01:24:28,530 --> 01:24:31,430
That's why I wanted him
to train with Luke.

962
01:24:31,530 --> 01:24:33,230
I just never should have sent him away.

963
01:24:33,330 --> 01:24:34,910
That's when I lost him.

964
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:38,160
That's when I lost you both.

965
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:42,920
We both had to deal with it
in our own way.

966
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:46,880
I went back to the only thing
I was ever any good at.

967
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:48,670
We both did.

968
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:52,620
We lost our son.

969
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:53,870
Forever.

970
01:24:53,970 --> 01:24:54,970
No.

971
01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:56,640
It was Snoke.

972
01:24:57,100 --> 01:24:59,710
He seduced our son to the dark side.

973
01:24:59,810 --> 01:25:01,400
But we can still save him.

974
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:03,230
Me.

975
01:25:04,150 --> 01:25:05,190
You.

976
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:08,340
If Luke couldn't reach him, how could I?

977
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:09,860
Luke is a Jedi.

978
01:25:11,450 --> 01:25:12,780
You're his father.

979
01:25:15,490 --> 01:25:19,270
There is still light in him, I know it.

980
01:25:19,370 --> 01:25:21,060
General...

981
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:23,670
the reconnaissance report
on the enemy base is coming.

982
01:25:50,490 --> 01:25:51,490
Where am I?

983
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:55,140
" You're my guest. "

984
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:56,560
Where are the others?

985
01:25:56,660 --> 01:25:58,310
" Do you mean the murderers... "

986
01:25:58,410 --> 01:26:01,290
" traitors, and thieves
you call friends? "

987
01:26:02,250 --> 01:26:04,710
" You'll be relieved to hear
I have no idea. "

988
01:26:06,710 --> 01:26:08,790
" You still want to kill me. "

989
01:26:09,590 --> 01:26:13,260
That happens when you're being hunted
by a creature in a mask.

990
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:40,030
Tell me about the droid.

991
01:26:40,870 --> 01:26:44,100
He's a BB unit with a selenium drive
and a thermal hyperscan vindicator.

992
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:46,310
It's carrying a section
of a navigational chart.

993
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:47,770
And we have the rest.

994
01:26:47,870 --> 01:26:50,820
Recovered from the archives of the
Empire but we need the last piece.

995
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:53,380
And somehow you convinced
the droid to show it to you.

996
01:26:55,010 --> 01:26:56,010
You.

997
01:26:57,470 --> 01:26:58,720
A scavenger.

998
01:27:01,050 --> 01:27:03,180
You know I can take whatever I want.

999
01:27:09,310 --> 01:27:11,230
You're so lonely.

1000
01:27:13,230 --> 01:27:14,730
So afraid to leave.

1001
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:21,820
At night, desperate to sleep.

1002
01:27:24,950 --> 01:27:26,540
You imagine an ocean.

1003
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:28,790
I see it.

1004
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:31,790
I see the island.

1005
01:27:36,380 --> 01:27:37,670
And Han Solo.

1006
01:27:40,010 --> 01:27:42,180
You feel like he's the father
you never had.

1007
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,300
He would have disappointed you.

1008
01:27:44,430 --> 01:27:45,720
Get out of my head.

1009
01:27:46,850 --> 01:27:48,390
I know you've seen the map.

1010
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:51,140
It's in there.

1011
01:27:52,060 --> 01:27:53,310
And now you'll give it to me.

1012
01:28:01,950 --> 01:28:03,990
Don't be afraid. I feel it, too.

1013
01:28:06,450 --> 01:28:08,950
I'm not giving you anything.

1014
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:10,660
We'll see.

1015
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:51,660
You.

1016
01:28:52,750 --> 01:28:53,750
You're afraid.

1017
01:28:56,790 --> 01:28:59,710
That you will never be
as strong as Darth Vader.

1018
01:29:08,890 --> 01:29:12,460
" The scavenger... "
resisted you?

1019
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:14,130
She is strong with the Force.

1020
01:29:14,230 --> 01:29:16,000
Untrained, but stronger than she knows.

1021
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:17,300
And the droid?

1022
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:20,720
Ren believed it was no longer
valuable to us.

1023
01:29:20,820 --> 01:29:23,440
That the girl was all we needed.

1024
01:29:23,570 --> 01:29:26,010
As a result, the droid has
most likely been returned...

1025
01:29:26,110 --> 01:29:27,240
to the hands of the enemy.

1026
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:29,060
They may have the map already.

1027
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:32,890
Then the Resistance must be destroyed
before they get to Skywalker.

1028
01:29:32,990 --> 01:29:34,850
We have their location.

1029
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:37,580
We tracked their reconnaissance ship
to the Ileenium system.

1030
01:29:38,580 --> 01:29:39,860
Good.

1031
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:42,820
Then we will crush them once and for all.

1032
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:44,670
Prepare the weapon.

1033
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:48,070
Supreme Leader, I can get
the map from the girl.

1034
01:29:48,170 --> 01:29:49,970
I just need your guidance.

1035
01:29:51,590 --> 01:29:55,680
If what you say about this girl is true...

1036
01:29:56,310 --> 01:30:00,980
Bring her to me.

1037
01:30:14,950 --> 01:30:17,100
You will remove these restraints...

1038
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:20,290
and leave this cell with the door open.

1039
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:25,790
" What did you say? "

1040
01:30:28,710 --> 01:30:32,970
You will remove these restraints
and leave this cell with the door open.

1041
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:43,520
" I'll tighten those restraints,
scavenger scum. "

1042
01:30:57,830 --> 01:31:01,870
You will remove these restraints
and leave this cell with the door open.

1043
01:31:05,580 --> 01:31:09,000
" I will remove these restraints
and leave the cell with the door open. "

1044
01:31:17,930 --> 01:31:20,960
" - And you'll drop your weapon.
- And I'll drop my weapon. "

1045
01:31:33,690 --> 01:31:34,780
" No. "

1046
01:31:35,780 --> 01:31:36,780
" No. "

1047
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:39,810
" Guards! "

1048
01:31:42,370 --> 01:31:43,370
" Guards! "

1049
01:31:48,380 --> 01:31:50,610
Begin charging the weapon.

1050
01:31:50,710 --> 01:31:52,030
Yes, sir.

1051
01:31:52,130 --> 01:31:53,420
Weapon charging.

1052
01:32:12,690 --> 01:32:16,110
The scan data from Snap's reconnaissance
flight confirms Finn's report.

1053
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:19,570
They've somehow created a hyper-lightspeed
weapon built within the planet itself.

1054
01:32:19,740 --> 01:32:20,680
A laser cannon?

1055
01:32:20,780 --> 01:32:22,840
We're not sure how to describe
a weapon of this scale.

1056
01:32:22,850 --> 01:32:23,840
It's another Death Star.

1057
01:32:23,850 --> 01:32:25,480
I wish that were the case, Major.

1058
01:32:25,660 --> 01:32:26,910
This was the Death Star.

1059
01:32:29,670 --> 01:32:32,170
And this is Starkiller Base.

1060
01:32:32,670 --> 01:32:33,820
So, it's big.

1061
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:37,010
How is it possible to power
a weapon of that size?

1062
01:32:37,130 --> 01:32:39,260
It uses the power of the sun.

1063
01:32:40,470 --> 01:32:43,830
As the weapon is charged
the sun is drained until it disappears.

1064
01:32:43,930 --> 01:32:44,930
Ma'am.

1065
01:32:46,930 --> 01:32:49,520
The First Order, they're charging
the weapon again now.

1066
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:52,350
Our system is the next target.

1067
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:53,460
Oh, my.

1068
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:55,150
Without the Republic fleet, we're doomed.

1069
01:32:55,150 --> 01:32:56,930
Okay. How do we blow it up?

1070
01:32:57,030 --> 01:32:59,350
- There's always a way to do that.
- Han's right.

1071
01:32:59,450 --> 01:33:02,560
In order for that amount
of power to be contained...

1072
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:04,740
that base has to have some
kind of thermal oscillator.

1073
01:33:04,740 --> 01:33:06,910
There is one. Precinct 47.

1074
01:33:07,490 --> 01:33:08,730
Here.

1075
01:33:08,830 --> 01:33:10,790
If we can destroy that oscillator...

1076
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:13,860
it might destabilize the core
and cripple the weapon.

1077
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:15,740
- Maybe the planet.
- We'll go in there,

1078
01:33:15,750 --> 01:33:17,810
we'll hit that oscillator
with everything we've got.

1079
01:33:17,820 --> 01:33:20,790
They have defensive shields
that our ships cannot penetrate.

1080
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:22,200
We disable the shields.

1081
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:23,970
Kid, you worked there.

1082
01:33:24,090 --> 01:33:25,080
What do you got?

1083
01:33:25,180 --> 01:33:26,370
I can do it.

1084
01:33:26,470 --> 01:33:27,720
I like this guy.

1085
01:33:27,850 --> 01:33:29,810
I can disable the shields,
but I have to be there.

1086
01:33:29,810 --> 01:33:31,250
On the planet.

1087
01:33:31,350 --> 01:33:32,980
- We'll get you there.
- Han, how?

1088
01:33:33,730 --> 01:33:35,230
If I told you, you wouldn't like it.

1089
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:37,220
So we disable the shields...

1090
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:39,610
we take out the oscillator
and we blow up their big gun.

1091
01:33:39,730 --> 01:33:41,820
All right. Let's go.

1092
01:34:04,340 --> 01:34:05,830
Chewie, check that donal capitator.

1093
01:34:05,930 --> 01:34:07,410
Come on. Let's go.

1094
01:34:07,510 --> 01:34:09,720
Finn, be careful with those.
They're explosives.

1095
01:34:09,850 --> 01:34:10,890
Now you tell me?

1096
01:34:11,010 --> 01:34:14,230
You know, no matter how much we fought...

1097
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:17,960
I've always hated watching you leave.

1098
01:34:18,060 --> 01:34:19,270
That's why I did it.

1099
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:22,030
So you'd miss me.

1100
01:34:24,780 --> 01:34:26,570
I did miss you.

1101
01:34:28,030 --> 01:34:29,810
It wasn't all bad, was it?

1102
01:34:29,910 --> 01:34:30,980
Huh?

1103
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:34,200
Some of it was... good.

1104
01:34:34,370 --> 01:34:36,040
Pretty good.

1105
01:34:39,380 --> 01:34:42,250
- Some things never change.
- True.

1106
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:44,800
You still drive me crazy.

1107
01:34:53,970 --> 01:34:55,890
If you see our son...

1108
01:34:58,390 --> 01:35:00,060
bring him home.

1109
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:08,140
" Sir, sensors triggered in Hangar 718. "

1110
01:35:08,240 --> 01:35:09,890
" We're searching the area. "

1111
01:35:09,990 --> 01:35:12,120
" She's just beginning
to test her powers. "

1112
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:15,660
" The longer it takes to find her
the more dangerous she becomes. "

1113
01:35:20,750 --> 01:35:22,360
" All sentry droids... "

1114
01:35:22,460 --> 01:35:25,990
" all sentry droids, resynchronize
to Galactic Standard Time. "

1115
01:35:26,090 --> 01:35:28,090
" Offset 473. "

1116
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:31,930
How are we getting in?

1117
01:35:32,050 --> 01:35:34,000
Their shields have
a fractional refresh rate.

1118
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:37,270
Keeps anything traveling slower
than lightspeed from getting through.

1119
01:35:37,850 --> 01:35:39,930
We're making our landing
approach at lightspeed?

1120
01:35:41,390 --> 01:35:42,480
Chewie, get ready.

1121
01:35:43,770 --> 01:35:44,940
And... Now!

1122
01:35:48,860 --> 01:35:50,530
I am pulling up!

1123
01:35:57,240 --> 01:35:58,850
I get any higher...

1124
01:35:58,950 --> 01:36:00,210
they'll see us!

1125
01:36:22,140 --> 01:36:24,520
Sir, she was not found in Hangar 718.

1126
01:36:24,650 --> 01:36:25,810
But all troops are on alert.

1127
01:36:25,810 --> 01:36:27,190
" Put every hangar on lockdown. "

1128
01:36:27,310 --> 01:36:29,130
" She's going to try to steal
a ship to esc... "

1129
01:36:31,610 --> 01:36:33,150
" Han Solo. "

1130
01:36:44,370 --> 01:36:46,070
The flooding tunnel is over that ridge.

1131
01:36:46,170 --> 01:36:47,400
We'll get in that way.

1132
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:49,400
What was your job
when you were based here?

1133
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:50,500
Sanitation.

1134
01:36:53,380 --> 01:36:55,070
Sanitation?

1135
01:36:55,170 --> 01:36:57,010
Then how do you know
how to disable the shields?

1136
01:36:57,010 --> 01:36:58,010
I don't.

1137
01:36:58,140 --> 01:36:59,890
I'm just here to get Rey.

1138
01:37:00,010 --> 01:37:03,580
People are counting on us.
The galaxy is counting on us.

1139
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:05,020
Solo, we'll figure it out.

1140
01:37:05,980 --> 01:37:07,400
We'll use the Force.

1141
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:09,590
That's not how the Force works.

1142
01:37:11,190 --> 01:37:13,730
Oh, really? You're cold?

1143
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:14,900
Come on.

1144
01:37:22,330 --> 01:37:23,600
Report.

1145
01:37:23,700 --> 01:37:25,910
Weapon charged in 15 minutes, sir.

1146
01:37:28,370 --> 01:37:29,380
" Hey! "

1147
01:37:32,550 --> 01:37:34,750
The longer we're here
the less luck we're gonna have.

1148
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:37,380
- The shields.
- I have an idea about that.

1149
01:37:45,350 --> 01:37:47,790
- You remember me?
" - FN-2187. "

1150
01:37:47,890 --> 01:37:49,140
Not anymore.

1151
01:37:49,310 --> 01:37:50,630
The name's Finn and I'm in charge.

1152
01:37:50,730 --> 01:37:52,760
I'm in charge now, Phasma. I'm in charge.

1153
01:37:52,860 --> 01:37:54,840
- Bring it down. Bring it down.
- Yeah.

1154
01:37:54,940 --> 01:37:56,070
Follow me.

1155
01:38:09,250 --> 01:38:10,790
" Have you checked out the new T-17s? "

1156
01:38:10,790 --> 01:38:13,630
" The T-17s, as far as I can tell
are a great improvement. "

1157
01:38:13,750 --> 01:38:15,590
" Yeah. That's what they tell you. "

1158
01:38:15,710 --> 01:38:17,250
" But believe me, they don't hold up. "

1159
01:38:17,260 --> 01:38:18,760
" - They don't?
- No. "

1160
01:38:54,250 --> 01:38:56,090
You want me to blast
that bucket off your head?

1161
01:38:56,090 --> 01:38:57,190
Lower the shields.

1162
01:38:57,290 --> 01:38:59,130
" You're making a big mistake. "

1163
01:38:59,260 --> 01:39:01,340
Do it.

1164
01:39:05,590 --> 01:39:09,040
Solo, if this works, we're not gonna
have a lot of time to find Rey.

1165
01:39:09,140 --> 01:39:10,520
Don't worry, kid.

1166
01:39:11,310 --> 01:39:12,710
We won't leave here without her.

1167
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:17,380
" You can't be so stupid
as to think this will be easy. "

1168
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:20,050
" My troops will storm
this block and kill you all. "

1169
01:39:20,150 --> 01:39:21,990
I disagree. What do we do with her?

1170
01:39:22,610 --> 01:39:24,150
Is there a garbage chute?

1171
01:39:24,820 --> 01:39:26,160
Trash compactor?

1172
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:28,410
Yeah, there is.

1173
01:39:28,740 --> 01:39:30,270
General, their shields are down.

1174
01:39:30,370 --> 01:39:31,940
Thank the Maker!

1175
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:33,770
Han did it. Send them in.

1176
01:39:33,870 --> 01:39:35,770
Give Poe full authorization for attack.

1177
01:39:35,870 --> 01:39:38,150
Black Leader,
go to sub-lights on your call.

1178
01:39:38,250 --> 01:39:39,240
Roger, base.

1179
01:39:39,340 --> 01:39:41,050
Red squad, Blue squad, take my lead.

1180
01:39:41,250 --> 01:39:43,260
Dropping out of lightspeed.

1181
01:39:57,020 --> 01:39:58,520
" Almost in range. "

1182
01:39:58,690 --> 01:40:01,420
Hit the target dead center.
As many runs as we can get.

1183
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:03,400
Approaching target.

1184
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:08,820
Fighters incoming!

1185
01:40:09,700 --> 01:40:11,270
" Coming at 28.336. "

1186
01:40:11,370 --> 01:40:13,140
Forty-five! Shields up! Shields up!

1187
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:14,910
Dispatch all squadrons.

1188
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:16,540
Yes, General.

1189
01:40:17,370 --> 01:40:18,530
All right. Let's light it up.

1190
01:40:28,130 --> 01:40:30,200
- Ah, direct hit.
- But no damage!

1191
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:31,650
" Yeah, we gotta keep hitting it. "

1192
01:40:31,720 --> 01:40:33,010
Another bombing run.

1193
01:40:33,140 --> 01:40:35,830
" Remember, when the sun is gone
that weapon will be ready to fire. "

1194
01:40:35,930 --> 01:40:38,520
But as long as there's light,
we got a chance.

1195
01:40:40,230 --> 01:40:41,770
Guys, we got a lot of company!

1196
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:50,010
" We think they may be splitting up. "

1197
01:40:50,110 --> 01:40:52,070
" Heading to quadrants 4 and 5. "

1198
01:40:59,910 --> 01:41:01,900
We'll use the charges
to blow that blast door.

1199
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,740
I'll go in and draw fire,
but I'm gonna need cover.

1200
01:41:04,840 --> 01:41:06,000
You sure you're up for this?

1201
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:07,200
Hell, no.

1202
01:41:07,300 --> 01:41:08,570
I'll go in and try to find Rey.

1203
01:41:08,670 --> 01:41:09,970
The troopers will be on our tail.

1204
01:41:09,970 --> 01:41:12,080
We have to be ready for that.

1205
01:41:12,180 --> 01:41:13,950
There's an access tunnel that leads...

1206
01:41:14,050 --> 01:41:16,580
Why are you doing that? Hmm?
Why are you doing this?

1207
01:41:16,680 --> 01:41:18,040
I'm trying to come up with a plan.

1208
01:41:34,740 --> 01:41:36,310
You all right?

1209
01:41:36,410 --> 01:41:38,020
- Yeah.
- Good.

1210
01:41:38,120 --> 01:41:39,690
What happened to you? Did he hurt you?

1211
01:41:39,790 --> 01:41:41,160
Finn, what are you doing here?

1212
01:41:41,290 --> 01:41:43,370
We came back for you.

1213
01:41:44,250 --> 01:41:45,780
What'd he say?

1214
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:47,250
That it was your idea.

1215
01:41:51,050 --> 01:41:52,130
Thank you.

1216
01:41:56,010 --> 01:41:57,580
How did you get away?

1217
01:41:57,680 --> 01:41:58,700
I can't explain it.

1218
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:00,870
And you wouldn't believe it.

1219
01:42:00,970 --> 01:42:03,310
Escape now, hug later.

1220
01:42:18,490 --> 01:42:20,030
I got one behind me.

1221
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:21,540
" - You see it? "
- Yeah. I'm on it.

1222
01:42:30,170 --> 01:42:32,130
- Burillo's been hit.
- Watch out for ground fire.

1223
01:42:36,930 --> 01:42:38,870
They're in trouble.

1224
01:42:38,970 --> 01:42:40,390
We can't leave.

1225
01:42:42,180 --> 01:42:45,170
My friend's got a bag full of explosives.

1226
01:42:45,270 --> 01:42:46,920
Let's use them.

1227
01:42:47,020 --> 01:42:48,390
General, are you seeing this?

1228
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:49,840
Two more X-wings down.

1229
01:42:49,940 --> 01:42:52,300
That's half our fleet destroyed.

1230
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:55,050
And their weapon will be fully
charged in ten minutes.

1231
01:42:55,150 --> 01:42:57,280
It would take a miracle to save us now.

1232
01:43:23,720 --> 01:43:24,700
Ah.

1233
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:27,140
Girl knows her stuff.

1234
01:43:36,110 --> 01:43:38,550
We'll set the charges
against every other column.

1235
01:43:39,780 --> 01:43:41,720
You're right. That's a better idea.

1236
01:43:41,820 --> 01:43:43,810
You take the top. I'll go down below.

1237
01:43:43,910 --> 01:43:45,560
Detonator.

1238
01:43:45,660 --> 01:43:47,330
We'll meet back here.

1239
01:44:32,750 --> 01:44:33,750
" Find them. "

1240
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:36,520
Ben!

1241
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:50,410
" Han Solo. "

1242
01:45:51,110 --> 01:45:53,990
" I've been waiting for this day
for a long time. "

1243
01:46:13,260 --> 01:46:16,760
Take off that mask. You don't need it.

1244
01:46:17,350 --> 01:46:19,230
" What do you think you'll see if I do? "

1245
01:46:19,350 --> 01:46:21,600
The face of my son.

1246
01:46:43,460 --> 01:46:45,630
Your son is gone.

1247
01:46:46,920 --> 01:46:49,260
He was weak and foolish like his father.

1248
01:46:49,420 --> 01:46:51,170
So I destroyed him.

1249
01:46:53,260 --> 01:46:55,640
That's what Snoke wants you to believe.

1250
01:46:56,890 --> 01:46:58,600
But it's not true.

1251
01:46:59,930 --> 01:47:02,000
My son is alive.

1252
01:47:02,100 --> 01:47:03,540
No.

1253
01:47:03,640 --> 01:47:05,840
The Supreme Leader is wise.

1254
01:47:05,940 --> 01:47:08,670
Snoke is using you for your power.

1255
01:47:08,770 --> 01:47:10,570
When he gets what he wants,
he'll crush you.

1256
01:47:15,820 --> 01:47:17,490
You know it's true.

1257
01:47:23,120 --> 01:47:24,110
It's too late.

1258
01:47:24,210 --> 01:47:25,770
No, it's not.

1259
01:47:25,870 --> 01:47:27,630
Leave here with me. Come home.

1260
01:47:29,380 --> 01:47:30,800
We miss you.

1261
01:47:39,510 --> 01:47:41,640
I'm being torn apart.

1262
01:47:44,480 --> 01:47:46,640
I want to be free of this pain.

1263
01:47:52,070 --> 01:47:55,320
I know what I have to do, but I don't know
if I have the strength to do it.

1264
01:47:59,240 --> 01:48:00,310
Will you help me?

1265
01:48:00,410 --> 01:48:02,240
Yes. Anything.

1266
01:48:50,540 --> 01:48:53,360
No!

1267
01:49:00,300 --> 01:49:01,550
Thank you.

1268
01:49:09,060 --> 01:49:10,060
No.

1269
01:50:25,380 --> 01:50:28,790
The oscillator's been damaged
but is still functional.

1270
01:50:28,890 --> 01:50:31,390
Admiral, their weapon
will fire in two minutes.

1271
01:50:42,650 --> 01:50:44,110
The Falcon's this way.

1272
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,340
We're not done yet.

1273
01:51:09,510 --> 01:51:11,340
You're a monster.

1274
01:51:11,470 --> 01:51:13,350
It's just us now.

1275
01:51:14,510 --> 01:51:16,020
Han Solo can't save you.

1276
01:51:24,820 --> 01:51:26,610
Rey!

1277
01:51:29,400 --> 01:51:30,890
Rey.

1278
01:51:30,990 --> 01:51:31,990
Rey!

1279
01:51:33,820 --> 01:51:35,430
Oh, no. No, no.

1280
01:51:35,530 --> 01:51:36,530
Rey.

1281
01:51:38,750 --> 01:51:40,290
Traitor!

1282
01:51:50,840 --> 01:51:52,380
That lightsaber.

1283
01:51:53,510 --> 01:51:54,540
It belongs to me.

1284
01:51:54,640 --> 01:51:56,290
Come get it.

1285
01:53:44,120 --> 01:53:45,200
We just lost R-1.

1286
01:53:45,830 --> 01:53:47,100
" We're overwhelmed. "

1287
01:53:47,200 --> 01:53:48,500
What do we do? It isn't working.

1288
01:53:49,250 --> 01:53:51,530
Black Leader, there's a brand
new hole in that oscillator.

1289
01:53:52,500 --> 01:53:54,420
" Looks like our friends got in. "

1290
01:53:55,050 --> 01:53:56,910
Red Four, Red Six, cover us.

1291
01:53:57,010 --> 01:53:58,160
- I'm on it.
- Roger.

1292
01:53:58,260 --> 01:53:59,780
Everybody else, hit the target hard.

1293
01:53:59,880 --> 01:54:00,960
Give it everything you got.

1294
01:54:13,710 --> 01:54:15,270
I need some help here. I need some help!

1295
01:54:15,270 --> 01:54:16,520
- Coming in!
- Watch out!

1296
01:54:17,730 --> 01:54:18,990
I'm hit!

1297
01:54:24,490 --> 01:54:26,410
All teams,
" I'm going in. "

1298
01:54:26,530 --> 01:54:27,690
" Pull up and cover me. "

1299
01:54:27,790 --> 01:54:29,540
Copy that, Black Leader. Good luck, Poe.

1300
01:54:35,670 --> 01:54:37,550
Weapon fully charged in 30 seconds.

1301
01:54:39,050 --> 01:54:40,210
Prepare to fire.

1302
01:56:13,310 --> 01:56:14,720
You need a teacher.

1303
01:56:16,600 --> 01:56:18,390
I could show you the ways of the Force.

1304
01:56:21,020 --> 01:56:22,110
The Force?

1305
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:13,960
- All eyes on that TIE fighter.
- We're losing power rapidly!

1306
01:58:16,340 --> 01:58:18,240
Lieutenant! Get back to your station!

1307
01:58:18,340 --> 01:58:21,640
Just look! We won't survive.
Even Hux is gone.

1308
01:58:21,760 --> 01:58:23,270
Supreme Leader.

1309
01:58:24,140 --> 01:58:26,090
The fuel cells have ruptured.

1310
01:58:26,190 --> 01:58:28,310
The collapse of the planet has begun.

1311
01:58:28,520 --> 01:58:32,570
Leave the base at once
and come to me with Kylo Ren.

1312
01:58:33,650 --> 01:58:35,510
It is time...

1313
01:58:35,610 --> 01:58:37,950
to complete his training.

1314
01:58:40,280 --> 01:58:41,280
Finn!

1315
01:58:42,030 --> 01:58:43,240
Finn.

1316
01:59:32,370 --> 01:59:35,460
- All teams, " I got eyes on them. "
- Yes!

1317
01:59:58,400 --> 02:00:01,530
Our job's done here. Let's go home.

1318
02:00:16,710 --> 02:00:19,050
Easy, easy. He's hurt.

1319
02:00:19,170 --> 02:00:20,380
We've got a heartbeat.

1320
02:01:22,440 --> 02:01:24,070
R2-D2!

1321
02:01:24,940 --> 02:01:25,940
You've come back.

1322
02:01:29,910 --> 02:01:31,320
You found what?

1323
02:01:31,450 --> 02:01:33,450
How dare you call me that!

1324
02:01:35,830 --> 02:01:37,900
Find Master Luke, how?

1325
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:39,020
Come, R2.

1326
02:01:39,120 --> 02:01:41,130
We must go tell the others at once!

1327
02:01:42,460 --> 02:01:43,530
General.

1328
02:01:43,630 --> 02:01:45,800
Excuse me, General.

1329
02:01:50,380 --> 02:01:52,890
R2 may contain some much-needed good news.

1330
02:01:53,550 --> 02:01:55,010
Tell me.

1331
02:02:05,400 --> 02:02:06,820
Yeah. All right, buddy. Hold on.

1332
02:02:21,250 --> 02:02:22,870
The map, it is complete.

1333
02:02:23,500 --> 02:02:25,150
Luke.

1334
02:02:25,250 --> 02:02:28,500
Oh, my dear friend, how I've missed you.

1335
02:02:45,480 --> 02:02:47,510
We'll see each other again.

1336
02:02:47,610 --> 02:02:49,530
I believe that.

1337
02:02:57,700 --> 02:02:59,490
Thank you, my friend.

1338
02:03:14,380 --> 02:03:16,220
Rey.

1339
02:03:17,890 --> 02:03:20,680
May the Force be with you.
