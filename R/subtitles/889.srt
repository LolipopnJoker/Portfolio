1
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,751
Tactical.

2
00:05:02,025 --> 00:05:03,275
Visual.

3
00:05:10,425 --> 00:05:11,877
Tactical, stand by on torpedoes.

4
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,943
Ready...

5
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,349
Fire!

6
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,349
Evasive!

7
00:09:37,275 --> 00:09:44,239
Our ancestors cast out their animal
passions here on these sands.

8
00:09:45,075 --> 00:09:51,106
Our race was saved by the
attainment of Kolinahr.

9
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:55,620
Kolinahr: through which all
emotion is finally shed.

10
00:09:55,825 --> 00:10:00,573
You have labored long, Spock...

11
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:05,204
Now receive from us this
symbol of total logic.

12
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:33,400
Your thoughts... give them to me.

13
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,060
Our minds, Spock...

14
00:10:42,359 --> 00:10:45,320
...one and together.

15
00:10:57,475 --> 00:11:01,274
This consciousness calling
to you from space...

16
00:11:01,275 --> 00:11:04,778
It touches your human blood, Spock.

17
00:11:13,225 --> 00:11:16,686
You have not achieved Kolinahr.

18
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,985
His answer lies elsewhere.

19
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,594
He will not achieve his goal with us.

20
00:11:28,325 --> 00:11:32,328
Live long and prosper, Spock.
